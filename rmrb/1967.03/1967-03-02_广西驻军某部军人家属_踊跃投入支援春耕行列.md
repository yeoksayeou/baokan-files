According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanning, the family members of soldiers in a certain unit in Guangxi have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have taken the People's Liberation Army as an example and actively supported the local rural people's communes in spring ploughing production.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production," has dispatched a large number of personnel to the front lines of spring ploughing production. They actively assist the local rural people's communes and various levels of leading cadres in carrying out spring ploughing production. The family members of soldiers in a certain unit, taking the PLA as an example, have also actively arranged their household affairs and volunteered to go to the countryside. These family members have actively carried out propaganda activities in supporting spring ploughing production. They organized commune members to study Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasp revolution and promote production" and relevant editorials and important articles from the People's Daily. They also joined the poor and lower-middle peasants in exposing the evil plots of class enemies who tried every means to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They also helped the cadres correctly handle criticism from revolutionary masses.

In their labor, they took the lead in shouldering heavy tasks. When the production team needed water to irrigate vegetables from a river a mile away, and the riverbank was steep, they volunteered to carry the water to irrigate the vegetables; some family members found ways to collect fertilizer from everywhere, and in just one morning, they delivered more than three thousand pounds of high-quality fertilizer to the production team.

    广西驻军某部军人家属
    踊跃投入支援春耕行列
    据新华社南宁一日电　广西驻军某部军人家属热烈响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以解放军为榜样，热情支援驻地农村人民公社搞好春耕生产。
    人民解放军驻广西部队遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，派出大批人员开赴春耕生产第一线，积极协助驻地农村人民公社和各级领导干部抓好春耕生产。驻军某部军人家属以解放军为榜样，也主动安排好家务，争着下农村。这些军人家属在支援春耕生产中积极开展宣传活动，组织社员学习毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示和《人民日报》的有关社论和重要文章。他们还和贫下中农一起揭露阶级敌人千方百计破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，进一步激发了贫下中农的革命热情和生产积极性。他们还帮助干部正确对待革命群众的批评。
    在劳动中，他们抢挑重担。生产队浇菜的用水要到一里路外的河里去挑，河坡又高又陡，他们就争着去挑水浇菜；有的家属想办法到处找肥源，仅一个上午就为生产队送去三千多斤优质肥。
