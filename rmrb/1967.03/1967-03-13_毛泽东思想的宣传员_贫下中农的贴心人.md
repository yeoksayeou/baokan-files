A communication unit of a certain division of the Guangxi garrison actively engaged in political and ideological work while supporting spring plowing. Poor and lower-middle peasants praised them as "propagators of Mao Zedong Thought and beloved by poor and lower-middle peasants."

During the busy spring plowing season, the communication unit of a certain division of the Guangxi garrison not only provided manpower and materials to support local spring plowing but also sent personnel to the production brigades in their garrison area to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and actively assist the brigades in conducting political and ideological work. Poor and lower-middle peasants praised them as "propagators of Mao Zedong Thought and beloved by poor and lower-middle peasants."

Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Hearts of Revolutionary Cadres

Chairman Mao said, "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The soldiers of the communication unit, following Chairman Mao's instructions, first focused on helping the production brigades with the ideological work of their cadres and strengthening the leadership team. Brigade leader Huang Longde had a period of not focusing on production, pushing the responsibility of leading production to other cadres, and not going to the fields for over a month. When the masses criticized him, he not only did not accept the masses' opinions but also sulked. After learning about this, the model soldier Zhang Biao studied Mao's quotations with him: "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, and we have become somewhat wiser. We can do things better. Any party, any individual, is bound to make mistakes. We ask for fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we ask for quicker and more thorough corrections." He also had heart-to-heart talks with him, discussing his past hardships, the trust of the community members, his mistakes, the party's cadre policy, and the importance of doing a good job in spring plowing and promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Huang Longde became more and more moved, and his heart became clearer. He voluntarily made a self-criticism at the community meeting, saying, "I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, correct my mistakes for the people's interests, persist in what is right, and do as Chairman Mao says. I will work hard in spring plowing to make amends." Now he actively arranges production and takes the lead in attendance. He also uses evenings and rest times in the fields to organize community members to study Mao's quotations and propagate Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" to the community members.

The comrades of the communication unit helped Huang Longde solve his ideological problems and organized the brigade cadres to study together "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and "The Chinese Communist's Policy on the People's Liberation Army," as well as the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" and relevant editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily." They explained to them the party's cadre policy and the great significance of doing a good job in spring plowing this year. Thus, the cadres' hearts became clear, and they stood up one after another, full of fighting spirit, leading production.

Developing the Pioneer Role of Revolutionary Youth

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the young community members of this brigade organized the Red Guards. They are daring and revolutionary pioneers. However, they did not fully understand the significance of "grasp revolution, promote production," so they did not pay enough attention to production at the beginning. The comrades of the communication unit believed that these young pioneers are not only daring to revolutionize but also an important force in production. Fully mobilizing their enthusiasm and channeling the sky-high revolutionary spirit they have shown in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into spring plowing is a very important task.

The comrades of the communication unit first organized the young pioneers to repeatedly study and discuss Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." After studying, their understanding improved, and these Red Guard young pioneers expressed their determination to firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to be both revolutionary pioneers and production vanguards. They were not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and in labor, they competed with each other, none willing to fall behind. One day, the brigade was cutting sugarcane, and the weather was very cold, but they worked up a sweat; when fertilizing and carrying manure, the young pioneers were not afraid of the smell or dirt, carrying full loads and running fast. Inspired by the youth, the broad masses of community members were even more enthusiastic, and spring plowing was carried out with great vigor.

Resolutely Exposing the Enemy's Plot to Sabotage Spring Plowing

The poor and lower-middle peasant community members of this brigade had always been united and worked together, making revolution and production very energetic. However, during spring plowing, some poor and lower-middle peasants were not as united. Although they worked together every day, their thoughts did not align, the drums did not beat in unison, and their hearts were not united, affecting spring plowing.

What was the reason? The comrades of the communication unit conducted investigations among the community members and found that it was a bad element causing trouble. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in the countryside, this troublemaker stirred up trouble in the brigade, spreading rumors and sowing discord between poor and lower-middle peasants. After learning about this, the comrades of the communication unit, together with revolutionary peasants, called this bad element and sternly warned him to behave properly and not to cause trouble. They then promptly exposed this bad element's sabotage activities to all community members and organized everyone to study Mao's quotations: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there still remain enemies without guns. They are bound to struggle to the death with us, and we must not underestimate them." They explained to everyone that class enemies do not accept their annihilation and will always try every means to sabotage our unity between poor and lower-middle peasants and attempt to sabotage spring plowing. After hearing this, the poor and lower-middle peasants were very indignant and thus opened their eyes and raised their awareness. They firmly stated: The class enemies want to sabotage our unity, which is completely a pipe dream! The comrades of the communication unit then organized the poor and lower-middle peasant community members to study: "Middle peasants must be united, and it is wrong not to unite with them." "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, poor and lower-middle peasants united more closely. Everyone worked together to grasp revolution and promote production, making production hot and surging wave after wave. (According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 12)

    广西驻军某部通信连在支援春耕生产中，积极开展政治思想工作。贫下中农称赞他们是：
    毛泽东思想的宣传员  贫下中农的贴心人
    广西驻军某部通信连，在春耕大忙季节，除在人力物力上大力支援地方春耕，还派出人员深入驻地生产队，热情宣传毛泽东思想，积极协助生产队开展政治思想工作。贫下中农称赞他们是“毛泽东思想的宣传员，贫下中农的贴心人”。
    毛泽东思想照亮了革命干部的心
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”通信连的指战员，遵照毛主席这个教导，首先注意帮助生产队做好干部的思想工作，健全领导班子。生产队长黄长德，有一段时间不抓生产，把领导生产的担子推给其他干部，自己一个多月不下地。群众对他提出批评，他不但不接受群众的意见，还闹情绪。五好战士张彪了解到这个情况后，就同他一起学习毛主席语录：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”又同他一起谈心，从他过去的苦难家史谈到社员群众对他的信任；从他所犯的一些错误谈到党的干部政策；从搞好春耕生产谈到对搞好无产阶级文化大革命的意义。黄长德越听越感动，越听心里越亮堂，就主动在社员大会上检讨了自己的错误。他激动地说：“我一定按照毛主席的教导，为人民利益改正错的，坚持好的，毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做，在春耕生产中大干一场，将功补过。”现在他每天主动安排生产，带头出勤；还利用晚上和田头休息时间组织社员学习毛主席语录，向社员群众宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针。
    通信连的同志帮助黄长德解决了思想问题，又组织生产队干部一起学习《为人民服务》、《学习和时局》等毛主席著作和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》有关社论，给他们讲清党的干部政策，讲清搞好今年春耕生产的重大意义。这样，干部的心亮堂了，纷纷挺身而出，斗志昂扬，领导生产。
      发挥革命小将的先锋作用
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个生产队的年青社员组织了红卫兵。他们是敢闯敢干敢革命的闯将。但对抓革命、促生产的意义认识不足，因而开始时对生产重视得不够。通信连的同志认为，这些小将不仅敢于革命，也是生产上的一支重要力量，充分调动他们的积极性，把他们在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲用到春耕生产中去，这是十分重要的一件大事。
    通信连的同志们首先组织小将们反复学习和讨论毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。经过学习，提高了认识，这些红卫兵小将纷纷表示，要坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，既作革命的闯将，又当生产的先锋。他们不怕苦不怕累，在劳动中你追我赶，谁也不甘落后。一天，生产队砍甘蔗，天气很冷，他们却干得满头大汗；在积肥挑大粪时，小将们不怕臭，不怕脏，挑得满，跑得快。在青年们的带动下，广大社员群众，情绪更加高涨，春耕生产搞得热气腾腾。
    坚决揭露阶级敌人
    破坏春耕生产的阴谋
    这个生产队的贫农和中农社员，过去一直是一条心，一股劲，革命、生产搞得挺有劲。但是在春耕生产中，有一部分贫农和中农却不够团结了。他们每天虽然劳动在一起，思想却凑不拢，锣响鼓不响，人齐心不齐，给春耕生产带来了影响。
    这是什么原因呢？通信连的同志们深入到社员中去作调查，发现原来是一个坏分子在里面捣鬼。这个坏家伙在农村无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，就在队里兴风作浪，散布谣言，挑拨贫农和中农的关系。通信连的同志们了解以后，就和革命农民一起把这个坏分子喊来，严厉地警告他，只许他规规矩矩，不许他乱说乱动。接着又及时向全体社员揭穿了这个坏分子的破坏活动。并组织大家学习毛主席语录：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”给大家讲清，阶级敌人是不甘心他们的灭亡的，总是千方百计破坏我们贫农和中农的团结，妄想破坏春耕生产。贫下中农听了以后，对阶级敌人十分愤慨，从而擦亮了眼睛，提高了觉悟。他们坚定地表示：阶级敌人想要破坏我们的团结，这完全是妄想！通信连的同志又组织贫下中农社员学习：“中农是必须团结的，不团结中农是错误的。”“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”等毛主席语录。贫农和中农在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下更加紧密地团结起来了，大家同心协力狠抓革命，猛促生产，生产搞得热火朝天，一浪高过一浪。　（据新华社南宁十二日电）
