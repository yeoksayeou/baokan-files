According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 23rd, the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam issued a commentary on the 22nd to mark the second anniversary of the March 22, 1965, statement by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The commentary reaffirmed that the heroic people of South Vietnam are determined to fulfill the solemn pledge in the statement. Even if it takes five, ten, twenty years, or even longer, they will resolutely fight to the end to complete the sacred task of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the country in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The commentary said that at a time when U.S. imperialism is madly sending large numbers of U.S. expeditionary forces and their lackeys to the South, increasing weapons and war tools, strengthening and expanding the war of aggression, and intensifying aerial bombardment of the North, the March 22, 1965, five-point statement by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the pledge of the 14 million people of South Vietnam to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country. In the face of U.S. imperialism's blatant and mad aggression, the sole true representative of the people of South Vietnam—the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam—solemnly declared: The people of South Vietnam love peace, but they will not allow the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys to trample on their country and ride roughshod over them. They would rather die than be slaves. The 14 million compatriots in the South have united to wage a heroic struggle to defeat the U.S. aggressors and traitors, liberate South Vietnam, achieve independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality in South Vietnam, and contribute to the maintenance of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The statement showed the firm resolve of the strong people of the South to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and to advance bravely, even if it means moving mountains and filling the sea, to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The commentary said that over the past two years, the people and armed forces of the South have resolutely implemented this pledge to kill the enemy and save the country. Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, they have highly developed revolutionary heroism, advanced bravely, and concentrated their hatred on the muzzles of their guns and bayonets, dealing thunderous blows to the U.S. aggressors and their lackey groups.

The commentary said that after two years of fierce struggle with the U.S. and puppet forces, the military and people of the South have implemented the firm pledge of "rather die than be slaves" with a spirit of decisive battle and victory, and have successively foiled the various strategic plans of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that over the past two years, the war hawks in Washington have repeatedly spread false peace negotiations, attempting to deceive world public opinion and strengthen the war under the cover of this smokescreen. The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism has been repeatedly exposed. The only path for the people of South Vietnam is to stand up, take up arms, and resolutely defeat the warmongering and stubborn U.S. aggressors.

The commentary said that the development of the situation over the past two years has eloquently proven the historical significance of the March 22 statement. In the statement issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28, 1967, regarding the U.S. aggressors' dispatch of more troops and expansion of the war, the Front once again reaffirmed the position stated in the historic March 22, 1965, declaration by the 14 million people of South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam once again solemnly declared that the people of South Vietnam love peace very much, but as long as there are U.S. aggressor troops on their beloved country, they will never lay down their arms.

The commentary concluded by saying that on this historical anniversary of the March 22, 1965, declaration, the people and armed forces of South Vietnam, reviewing the glorious anti-war journey of the past two years, feel extremely excited and proud, and are determined to advance with firm steps, continue to strike the enemy heavily, and foil the U.S. aggressors' second dry-season counteroffensive plan and all future acts of aggression.

    南越解放通讯社发表评论说
    南越人民决心打垮美国侵略者
    坚决实现民族解放阵线五点声明的庄严誓言
    据新华社河内二十三日电　越南南方解放通讯社，二十二日就越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六五年三月二十二日的声明发表两周年发表评论。评论重申，英雄的越南南方人民坚决实现声明中的庄严誓言，即使要战斗五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，也要坚决战斗到底，完成解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国的抗美救国神圣事业。
    评论说，在美帝国主义疯狂地大规模向南方派遣美国远征军及其帮凶军，大量增加武器和战争工具，加强和扩大侵略战争，同时加强用飞机对北方进行破坏性战争的时候，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六五年三月二十二日发表的五点声明，是一千四百万越南南方人民决心解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国的誓言。面对美帝国主义的明目张胆的疯狂的侵略行动，越南南方人民的唯一真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会庄严宣告：越南南方人民是爱好和平的，但是越南南方人民决不允许美国侵略者及其走狗任意践踏自己的祖国和骑在自己的头上。宁死也不受人奴役，一千四百万南方同胞一致起来进行英勇的斗争，为击败美国侵略者和卖国贼，解放越南南方，在越南南方实现独立、民主、和平和中立，为维护印度支那和东南亚的和平作出贡献。声明显示了坚强的南方人民不惜牺牲一切，坚决克服种种困难和阻力，为了战胜美国侵略强盗，即使是要移长山，填东海，也坚决奋勇前进的坚强意志。
    评论说，两年来，南方人民和解放武装力量坚决实现这一杀敌救国誓言，在民族解放阵线的领导下，高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，奋勇前进，把仇恨集中到枪口和刺刀上，给了美国侵略者及其走狗集团以雷霆般的打击。
    评论说，经过了同美伪军两年的激烈较量，南方军民实现“宁死不当奴隶”的坚强誓言，以决战决胜的精神接连粉碎了美帝国主义的各个战略计划。
    评论指出，两年来，华盛顿侵略战争头目还一再散布虚假的和平谈判论调，妄图欺骗世界舆论，以便在这种烟幕的掩盖下加强战争。美帝国主义的这种阴谋，已不断地被揭穿。越南南方人民的唯一道路是站起来，拿起武器，坚决打垮好战和顽固的美国侵略者。
    评论说，过去两年形势的发展，雄辩地证明了三月二十二日声明的历史意义。越南南方民族解放阵线一九六七年二月二十八日就美国侵略者增派军队和扩大战争的行动发表的声明中，再次重申，一千四百万越南南方人民在一九六五年三月二十二日的历史性声明中所阐明的立场。越南南方民族解放阵线再次庄严宣布，越南南方人民非常热爱和平，但是，当自己可爱的祖国还有美国侵略军的时候，是绝对不会放下武器的。
    评论最后说，值此一九六五年三月二十二日声明发表的历史纪念日，越南南方人民和解放武装力量回顾两年来轰轰烈烈的抗战历程，感到无比兴奋和自豪，决心以坚定的步伐奋勇前进，继续狠狠地打击敌人，粉碎美国侵略者的第二个旱季反攻计划和它今后的一切侵略行动。
