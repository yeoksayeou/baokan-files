The people, progressive individuals, and newspapers of Latin America have enthusiastically praised the great power of Mao Zedong Thought in guiding the revolutionary cause of the people of the world and have highly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Two miners from the 20th-century mines in Bolivia pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong is the leader of the oppressed people of all countries in the world and represents the cause of Marxism-Leninism. One of the miners said: The attacks and slanders against China by the imperialist press have made the workers see that China is on the right path. He pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is to prevent the restoration of capitalism in China.

The famous journalist Emilio Jauregui of Argentina recently said: "Mao Zedong Thought is an indispensable basic weapon for all who join the ranks of the workers and are willing to fight for the revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the correct guide for genuine Marxist-Leninists to oppose imperialism, exploiters, and revisionists, to expose and defeat them. Learning the thoughts of the leader of the revolutionary people of China is the primary task of those who yearn to overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys in our country." He also said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an unprecedented event in the history of revolution and human history." He said that this cultural revolution "raises the struggle against the restoration of capitalism in the People's Republic of China to a new level and is a great inspiration for the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." He said: "I am fully convinced that the revolutionary masses under the leadership of Mao Zedong will surely achieve victory. Their victory is also our victory."

A friend from Venezuela said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China sets a brilliant example for the proletariat on how to continue advancing along the socialist path after seizing power. The fact that the Soviet Union took the revisionist road several decades after the success of the October Revolution is a painful lesson. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is precisely to eradicate the roots of revisionism and build a genuine socialist society. This revolution will have a profound impact on the course of world history.

A friend from Peru said that China is the first country in the world to carry out a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. What China is doing has far-reaching significance.

A Cuban doctor, after watching the color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-Member Cultural Revolution Army," excitedly said: Chairman Mao's health is truly good, and his spirit is truly vigorous. This is a great joy. He also said that the Red Guards educated by Chairman Mao are the most promising and revolutionary generation of Chinese youth. The reason China can cultivate such excellent youth is because China has the great Mao Zedong.

A Cuban professor said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows that China's path is the correct path. Now, more than 95% of the people in the world place their hopes in China.

An African friend in Cuba enthusiastically said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an unprecedented great revolution. This revolution will greatly inspire the fighting spirit of the oppressed people of the world. He said: Our responsibility as revolutionaries is to defend the proletarian revolutionary line of the greatest Marxist—Chairman Mao Zedong. Today, the representative of the proletarian revolutionary line in the world is our great teacher, Chairman Mao Zedong. He also said: We African revolutionaries are determined to carry out the revolution in Africa under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    中国文化大革命鼓舞亚非拉人民
    拉美人民把中国革命群众的胜利看成自己的胜利
    据新华社讯　拉丁美洲工人、进步人士和报刊热情地颂扬毛泽东思想在指导世界人民革命事业方面的巨大威力，并且盛赞毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    玻利维亚二十世纪矿场的两位矿工指出，毛泽东主席是世界各国被压迫人民的领袖，他代表着马克思列宁主义的事业。其中的一位矿工说：帝国主义的报纸对中国进行的攻击和诬蔑，使工人们看到，中国走的是一条正确的道路。他指出，目前在中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是为了防止在中国出现资本主义复辟。
    阿根廷著名的新闻工作者埃米略·豪雷吉最近发表谈话说：“毛泽东思想是指导一切加入工人行列、愿意为革命而斗争的战士的必不可少的基本武器。毛泽东思想是真正的马克思列宁主义者反对帝国主义、剥削者和修正主义者，揭露和战胜他们的正确指南。学习革命的中国人民的领袖的思想，是渴望在我国推翻美帝国主义和它在我国的走狗的统治的人们的首要任务。”他还说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命是革命历史和人类历史上空前未有的大事。”他说，这场文化大革命“把反对资本主义在中华人民共和国复辟的斗争提高到新的水平，对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国被剥削人民的革命斗争是一个巨大的鼓舞。”他说：“我完全相信毛泽东领导下的中国革命群众必将取得胜利。他们的胜利也就是我们的胜利。”
    一位委内瑞拉朋友说：中国无产阶级文化大革命为无产阶级在取得政权后如何沿着社会主义道路继续前进，树立了光辉的榜样。苏联在十月革命成功几十年后，走上了修正主义的道路，这是一个沉痛的教训。中国的无产阶级文化大革命正是为了铲除产生修正主义的根源，建设一个真正的社会主义社会。这场革命对世界历史的进程必将有着深远的意义。
    一位秘鲁朋友说，中国是世界上第一个搞无产阶级文化大革命的国家。中国这么搞，意义极为深远。
    一位古巴医生在看了《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》的彩色纪录影片后激动地说：毛主席的身体真好，精神真饱满，这是一件大喜事。他还说，毛主席教育出来的中国红卫兵是最有希望的、最革命的中国青年一代。中国所以能培养出这样的好青年，是因为中国有伟大的毛泽东。
    一位古巴教授说：中国无产阶级文化大革命，表明了中国的道路是正确的道路。现在世界上百分之九十五以上的人把希望寄托在中国身上。
    一位在古巴的非洲朋友热情地说：中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场史无前例的大革命。这场革命将大大地鼓舞世界被压迫人民的斗志。他说：我们革命者的责任就是要保卫最伟大的马克思主义者——毛泽东主席的无产阶级革命路线。在今天，国际上无产阶级革命路线的代表就是我们伟大的导师毛泽东主席。他还说：我们非洲革命者，决心用毛泽东思想作指导，把非洲的革命进行到底。
