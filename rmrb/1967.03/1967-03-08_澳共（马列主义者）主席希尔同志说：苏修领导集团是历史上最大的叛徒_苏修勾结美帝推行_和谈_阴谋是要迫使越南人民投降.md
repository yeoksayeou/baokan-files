		MELBOURNE, March 6 (Xinhua) - Chairman Hill of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists) wrote in an article published in the March 2 issue of "Vanguard" that the Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the Soviet people, betrayed Lenin and the October Revolution, colluded with U.S. imperialism to oppose China, and sold out the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

		The article said: "The Soviet leaders have completely betrayed the Soviet Union, Lenin, and the October Revolution. They are the most despicable traitors in history. The greatest betrayal by Khrushchev, Kosygin, and Brezhnev makes all past traitors pale in comparison."

		In the article titled "The Soviet Revisionist Leaders are the Biggest Traitors in History," Hill wrote: "The Soviet leaders have betrayed the entire socialist cause. This is a betrayal that transcends national borders... History will never forgive these traitors. Such large-scale betrayal is unprecedented."

		The article emphasized: "Some people accuse us of being anti-Soviet. But this is a slander. We love the Soviet Union. We uphold the great genius Lenin and his ideas. We firmly defend the October Revolution. We love the Soviet people."

		The article said, "However, it is precisely because of this love and respect that we are even more enraged by the great betrayal that Kosygin and Brezhnev are currently carrying out. Those who are anti-Soviet are precisely them, those who have betrayed Lenin, the October Revolution, and the Soviet Union."

		The article pointed out that more and more irrefutable evidence shows that the Soviet revisionist leadership is carrying out a capitalist restoration at home.

		The article said: "One can easily point out the capitalist characteristics appearing in the Soviet Union. The Soviet leaders bought two pages of the New York Times to advertise, inviting American monopoly capitalists to exploit the Soviet people. The Soviet leaders sold the right to establish factories in the Soviet Union to the Italian monopoly capitalist Fiat to exploit Soviet workers. They made the same deal with Japanese monopoly capitalists regarding the development of Siberia. They are now negotiating similar deals with American monopoly capitalists. This is pure capitalism."

		The article said: "The revisionists cover all this with a 'Marxist-Leninist' cloak. They say this is to help develop socialism... But facts are facts, and there are more and more of them. These facts point in only one direction—capitalism."

		The article pointed out that internationally, the Soviet revisionist leadership has degenerated into an "active collaborator of U.S. imperialism. It has economic, military, and political partnerships with U.S. imperialists."

		The article specifically pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is doing everything it can to collaborate with U.S. imperialism in pushing the "peace talks" plot in Vietnam, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. The article said: "There is an extremely obvious collusion between the Soviet revisionist leaders and the U.S. imperialists. They are conspiring to achieve 'peace' in Vietnam. The Soviet leaders tell the U.S. imperialists: stop the bombing, and we will help you achieve 'negotiations' in Vietnam. This means achieving U.S. occupation in Vietnam. If peace does not appear, then the logic derived from the Soviet revisionist standpoint would necessarily be: resume bombing so that you can stop bombing again, allowing us to strive for negotiations."

		The article pointed out: "The center of U.S.-Soviet cooperation is their anti-China policy. No one can deny this fact." The article said that participating in the U.S. imperialists' anti-China chorus, even fabricating lies to oppose the Chinese, are precisely people like Kosygin and Brezhnev. The article strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China crimes, such as brutally suppressing Chinese students on Red Square in Moscow and organizing mobs to attack the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union.

		The article then emphasized that Mao Zedong is indeed the Lenin of our time, and the Chinese people led by Mao Zedong are the most steadfast defenders of Lenin, the October Revolution, and the socialist cause of the Soviet Union.

		The article expressed the belief that the Soviet people will definitely unite with the Chinese people, and the Soviet people will definitely overthrow their revisionist leaders. The article called on the revolutionary people to rise up against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

    澳共（马列主义者）主席希尔同志说：
    苏修领导集团是历史上最大的叛徒
    苏修勾结美帝推行“和谈”阴谋是要迫使越南人民投降
    新华社墨尔本六日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔同志，二日在《先锋报》上发表文章，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团背叛苏联人民，背叛列宁和十月革命，勾结美帝国主义共同反华，并出卖越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    文章说：“苏联领导人完全背叛了苏联、列宁和十月革命。他们是历史上最卑鄙的叛徒。赫鲁晓夫、柯西金和勃列日涅夫的最大叛卖，使过去的一切叛徒相形见拙”。
    希尔同志在这篇题为《苏联修正主义领导人是历史上最大的叛徒》的文章中写道：“苏联领导人背叛了整个社会主义事业。这是超越一个国家国境的背叛行为……历史决不会饶恕这些叛徒。这样大规模的叛卖行为是前所未有的。”
    文章强调说：“有人指责我们反苏。但这只是一种诽谤。我们热爱苏联。我们维护伟大天才列宁和他的思想。我们坚决捍卫十月革命。我们热爱苏联人民。”
    文章说，“然而正是由于这种热爱和尊敬，使我们对柯西金和勃列日涅夫目前正在进行的重大叛卖行为更加怒火中烧。反苏的正是他们，背叛了列宁、十月革命和苏联的正是他们。”
    文章指出，越来越多的无可辩驳的事实证明，苏联修正主义领导集团正在国内大搞资本主义复辟。
    文章说：“可以随手指出苏联出现资本主义的特征。苏联领导人买了《纽约时报》的两页版面刊登广告，招揽美国垄断资本家去剥削苏联人民。苏联领导人向意大利垄断资本菲亚特汽车工厂出卖在苏联开办工厂的权利，来剥削苏联工人。他们就（开发）西伯利亚的问题同日本垄断资本家做了同样的交易。他们现在正同美国垄断资本家商谈同样的交易。这是不折不扣的资本主义。”
    文章说：“修正主义者给这一切披上一件‘马克思列宁主义’的外衣。他们说，这是为了有助于发展社会主义。……但是事实总归是事实，而且愈来愈多。这些事实只说明一个方向——资本主义。”
    文章指出，在国际上，苏联修正主义领导集团已经堕落成为“美帝国主义的积极合作者。它同美帝国主义者有着经济上、军事上和政治上的合伙关系”。
    文章特别指出，苏联修正主义领导集团正在千方百计地配合美帝国主义在越南问题上推行“和谈”阴谋，企图迫使越南人民投降。文章说：“苏联修正主义领导人和美帝国主义者之间存在着极其明显的勾结。他们正在合谋在越南实现‘和平’。苏联领导人对美帝国主义者说：停止轰炸，我们就会使你们在越南实现‘谈判’。这就是说，在越南实现美国的占领。如果和平没有出现，那么从苏联修正主义的立场出发所得出的逻辑就必然是：恢复轰炸，以便你们能够再次停炸，而使我们争取实现谈判。”
    文章指出：“美苏合作的中心点就是它们的反华政策。任何人都无法否认这是事实。”文章说，参加美帝国主义的反华合唱，甚至制造谎言来反对中国人的正是柯西金和勃列日涅夫之流。文章强烈谴责苏修领导集团在莫斯科红场上残酷镇压中国学生和组织暴徒袭击中国驻苏大使馆等反华罪行。
    文章接着强调说，毛泽东确确实实是当代的列宁，以毛泽东为首的中国人民是维护列宁、十月革命和苏联的社会主义事业的最坚定的旗手。
    文章表示相信，苏联人民一定会同中国人民团结起来，苏联人民一定会推翻他们的修正主义领导人。文章号召革命的人民起来反对美帝国主义，反对苏联修正主义。
