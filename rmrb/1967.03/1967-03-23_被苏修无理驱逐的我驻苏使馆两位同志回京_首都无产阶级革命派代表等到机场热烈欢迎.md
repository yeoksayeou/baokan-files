Two Comrades Expelled from the Soviet Union by the Soviet Revisionists Return to Beijing

Representatives of the Revolutionary Masses of Beijing Welcome Them at the Airport

BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) — The first secretary, Miu Qun, and the third secretary, Sun Lin, of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, who were expelled by the Soviet government without reason, returned to our capital Beijing by plane today. They returned to the side of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and were warmly welcomed by representatives of the revolutionary masses of Beijing.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Chu Tunan, and staff members of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union who are currently in Beijing also went to the airport to welcome them. When Miu Qun and Sun Lin stepped off the plane, the welcoming crowd held up portraits of Chairman Mao, waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and repeatedly shouted, "Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live Leninism! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

When Miu Qun and Sun Lin left Moscow, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhiyuan, and others went to the airport to see them off warmly.
