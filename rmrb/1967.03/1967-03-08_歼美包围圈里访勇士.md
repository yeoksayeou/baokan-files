Within the Circle of Annihilation of the Americans

Dien Bien is a town in the province of Tien Giang, located on the eastern bank of the Dong Nai River. The American aggressors, in order to implement their plan to "pacify" the Mekong Delta, dispatched a battalion to establish a base in Dien Bien. However, from the day these invaders arrived, the local military and civilians established a circle of annihilation against them. In less than a month, over six hundred of these invaders were punished.

One morning, I arrived at this circle of annihilation. As soon as the boat docked, the tiled houses of Dien Bien came into view. The guide, a guerrilla fighter, pointed to these houses and said, "Our bullets can reach Dien Bien at any time because it is within the range of our various weapons."

Three Sisters is a cadre in this circle of annihilation. She is very familiar with the terrain here. Following the direction of Three Sisters' finger, I saw the groves, paths, riverbanks, and marshes surrounding Dien Bien. It is in these places that, over the past month, the American aggressors have been kept in a state of constant anxiety. They have not had a single day without being punished by the guerrillas.

As the sun rose, the weather began to heat up. Three Sisters said to me, "If you stay here a little longer, you will hear gunshots. On such a hot day, the American aggressors will definitely go to the river to cool off."

Sure enough, about half an hour later, the gunshots started. Initially, there were a few rifle shots, followed by bursts of submachine gun and machine gun fire. After a while, the gunshots stopped, leaving only two American helicopters and a reconnaissance plane circling in the sky, occasionally strafing randomly.

At this moment, a guerrilla fighter, carrying a carbine, walked towards us from the direction where the gunshots had just ceased. As soon as he saw Three Sisters, he began to speak excitedly, "Those bastards just poked their heads out from the grove and rushed into the village. We immediately counterattacked and killed several of them. One of them rushed into a house and grabbed a woman trying to escape. We immediately finished him off."

In the circle of annihilation around Dien Bien, such guerrilla fighters are everywhere. They always have their weapons at the ready and are frequently active around Dien Bien. They can hit the enemy, but the enemy cannot hit them.

The people here are both brave and calm. They continue to work and live normally, going to the fields to work or staying at home to weave mats. The children go to school with their backpacks. At the same time, they fiercely strike back at the American aggressors in the fields and by the rivers of their homeland.

On the very night I arrived at this circle of annihilation, after being beaten all day, the American aggressors all retreated into the town. The mobile film projection team screened a movie for the guerrillas and nearby residents on Highway 18. Everyone was in high spirits and came to watch the movie. When the captured American devils appeared on the screen, everyone clapped and laughed.

In the spirited battle life around Dien Bien, I seemed to hear the people in the circles of annihilation I had seen saying, "The more Americans come, the more anti-American heroes will emerge!"

### 歼美包围圈里访勇士

    歼美包围圈里访勇士
    迪建，是堤岸省芹德县的一个市镇，位于东万古河畔。美国强盗为实现“绥靖”湄公河三角洲的计划，向迪建派驻了一营军队建立据点。但是，当地军民从这群侵略强盗闯进来那天起，就建立起一个歼美包围圈。在不到一个月的时间里，就有六百多名侵略强盗遭到了惩罚。
    一天清晨，我到达了这个歼美包围圈。小船刚刚靠岸，迪建的瓦房就展现在眼前。领路的游击队员指着这些瓦房说：“我们的子弹随时可以打到迪建去，因为它在我们各种武器的射程之内。”
    三姐是这个歼美包围圈中的干部。她对这里的地形了如指掌。顺着三姐手指的方向，我看到了环绕着迪建的树丛、小路、河边和沼泽地等。就在这些地方，近一个月以来，美国强盗被打得寝食不安。他们没有一天不遭到游击队的惩罚。
    随着太阳的升起，天气开始热了。三姐对我说：“你在这里再呆一会儿，就可以听到枪声了。这么热的天气，美国强盗一定要到河里去浸水的。”
    果然，在大约半小时后，枪声开始响了。最初是几声步枪，接着是一阵阵的冲锋枪和机枪声。过了一会儿，枪声停止了，只剩下两架美国直升飞机和一架侦察机在空中盘旋，并且不时地胡乱扫射。
    这时，一个游击队员，背着一支卡宾枪，从枪声刚刚响过的方向朝我们走来。他一看见三姐就不停地说起来：“这帮死狗刚刚从树丛里露出来，就闯进了村子。我们立即迎头痛击，打死了好几个。一个家伙闯进一户人家，抓了一个妇女想逃走。我们立即结果了他。”
    在迪建歼美包围圈中，这样的游击队员是到处可见的。他们的手中时刻紧握武器，经常活跃在迪建周围。他们打敌人打得到，但敌人却打不着他们。
    这里的人们既勇敢又沉着，他们仍然照样进行着正常的劳动生活，照样下地干活，或者在家里编花草席，孩子们照样背着书包上学。与此同时，他们又在自己家乡的田野上和小河边，狠狠地打击美国侵略强盗。
    就在我到达这个歼美包围圈的当天晚上，美国强盗挨了一天打以后，都龟缩到镇里去了。流动电影放映队就在十八号公路上为游击队和附近的群众放映了一场电影，大家都兴高采烈地纷纷赶来看电影。当在银幕上出现被解放军活捉的美国鬼子时，人们都拍手大笑。
    在迪建一带的这种意气风发的战斗生活中，我仿佛听到了我所见过的歼美包围圈中的人们都在说：“美国佬来得越多，歼美勇士也就涌现得越多！”
