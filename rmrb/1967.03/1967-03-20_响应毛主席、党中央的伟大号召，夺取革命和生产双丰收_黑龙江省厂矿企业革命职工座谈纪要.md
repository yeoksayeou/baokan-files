In response to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, workers from factories and mines across Heilongjiang Province held a discussion meeting to ensure the realization of the great expectations and requirements set by our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

The great thought of Mao Zedong guides us to strive for the forefront

Liu Xuefeng
(Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory)

The great battle call issued by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country has greatly inspired the revolutionary workers and cadres in our factory. We immediately held a discussion, and we are determined to exert our utmost efforts to ensure the realization of the hopes and requirements set by our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

Since seizing power, our Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory has been faithfully implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, and the production situation has been improving day by day. Many workers who were once looked down upon by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have now often completed their tasks by two or even three times. So far this year, by March 11th, the entire factory has completed the production plan for April, and it is estimated that by the end of March, the plan for May can be completed. All revolutionary workers have proposed to ensure that the annual production plan for this year is completed one quarter ahead of schedule. The quality of the products has also been significantly improved.

Many sister units have praised us as models for grasping revolution and promoting production. However, we feel that we have not done enough. We know that only by further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works well, and by further arming all revolutionary workers with the great thought of Mao Zedong, can the entire factory forever maintain its youthful vigor and continuously create miracles. For this reason, we insist on studying Chairman Mao's works for four hours every week, holding a study session every Saturday, and studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" before each shift. Since these systems were established, they have promoted the ideological revolutionization of all workers in the factory.

Now, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a new battle call to us. We must definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better and make revolution and production even better.

Revolution is a pioneer, production is a model

Li Shusen
(North Manchuria Steel Plant Worker)

When we at the North Manchuria Steel Plant were resolutely fighting against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, those who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line manipulated their puppet organizations, incited workers who were unaware of the truth to leave their production posts, created shutdown incidents, and attempted to crush the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. The entire plant's production was in a state of paralysis, with the smelting workshop unable to continue charging after completing steel, and repaired furnaces unable to be charged. The workshop had more than twice the normal amount of steel ingots stored inside. Two paths lay before us proletarian revolutionaries: should we let production stop? Or should we insist on production? We proletarian revolutionaries, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" deeply ingrained in our minds. We not only want to be pioneers of the revolution but also models of production. The proletarian revolutionary faction, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and energy, took the initiative to shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, fighting day and night. Driver Zhang Enfu, in a situation of manpower shortage, fully played the role of a versatile worker. He did the work of four people: stoking, driving, and switching tracks. Comrades Wang Shuren and Ma Lingsheng worked day and night in the factory, treating the factory as their home, and insisted on working day and night. They said, "We are willing to endure all hardships, but we will not let production face any difficulties for even a moment." This ensured the completion of the production tasks.

After seizing power, we proletarian revolutionaries always remember Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We promptly established a revolutionary production command department, improved the production command system, and invited a deputy director and a deputy chief engineer with relatively minor mistakes to participate in production command, strengthening the organizational leadership of production and quickly establishing a new production order. In February, we fully completed the state plan, and in March, we achieved a significant increase over February.

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a new call to revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country. We proletarian revolutionaries at the North Manchuria Steel Plant will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and are determined to, under new conditions, rally even greater enthusiasm to strive to become genuine models of grasping revolution and promoting production.

Criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line must not be lenient

Jiang Fengzhen
(Harbin Power Plant Worker)

Hearing the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Across the Country" on the radio, I have been boiling with excitement and emotion. This is the greatest trust and encouragement from our most, most great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to us. This is the great battle call from the reddest sun in our hearts to us. We, the working class, are the leading force of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must, in the great proletarian cultural revolution and under new conditions, rally even greater enthusiasm, strive to be at the forefront, grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production to strive to be models of grasping revolution and promoting production.

Since implementing the great alliance and seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the revolutionary workers and cadres at the Harbin Power Plant have seen significant changes in production. In just one month after seizing power, we saved 64,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 807 tons of coal, and we also utilized workers' wisdom to make an electronic magnetometer. However, we are not satisfied with these achievements, and we are fully determined and confident to strive for even greater victories.

We must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by our great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories, but class struggle will have setbacks, and class enemies will inevitably launch counterattacks in various forms. We must stay vigilant. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a life-and-death struggle. We must thoroughly expose and criticize those who take the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line and must not be lenient.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership is the most authoritative

Yu Qingbin
(Harbin Boiler Factory Worker)

I read the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Across the Country" and felt elated. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee always point out the direction for us and inspire us to move forward at every critical moment of struggle. Chairman Mao is like he is in our factory, by our side. Every word he says touches our hearts, making us feel extremely close.

Our Harbin Boiler Factory implemented the "three-in-one combination" to seize power, and we encountered many obstacles in correctly handling the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." These obstacles mainly came from three aspects:

First, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were unwilling to accept their failure. They spread rumors and created chaos among the masses, deliberately pulling revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses down with them.

Second, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists took the opportunity to create trouble, fabricate false appearances, and sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and the proletarian cultural revolution.

Third, there were erroneous thoughts among the revolutionary masses, such as localism, anarchism, opportunism, and economism, mainly due to the "self" factor.

These problems must be solved; otherwise, a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power structure cannot be established, there will be no new revolutionary order, and production targets cannot be completed well. We deeply feel that establishing a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership is an important guarantee for completing new tasks under new conditions.

Before seizing power, some departments were not well-coordinated, enthusiasm could not be mobilized, and Party policies could not be implemented. Why? Because proletarian authority had not been established, and the "conservative" faction was slacking off and not listening to you. After seizing power, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership was established, and Party policies could be quickly implemented. We also, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, implemented streamlining and reducing the number of non-production personnel by two-thirds. This not only strengthened the production frontline but also improved work efficiency. In February, we completed the production target by 103%; the output value for March will reach the highest level in history.

Revolutionary technical personnel should go to the production frontline

Sun Baosheng
(Harbin Medical Machinery Factory Designer)

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a great battle call to revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country. As a technical personnel, I feel extremely excited and inspired. In the face of this great task, I am determined to bring the greatest enthusiasm to be a pioneer in grasping revolution and promoting production. In the past, we who did design work often did not pay attention to learning from workers' actual experiences but only relied on our own imagination or copied information from books to do the design, which was detached from reality. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the production frontline, and seriously learn from worker comrades. At the same time, I will closely combine with the using units to better understand their needs and design more and more practical new products.

    响应毛主席、党中央的伟大号召，夺取革命和生产双丰收
    ——黑龙江省厂矿企业革命职工座谈纪要
    伟大的毛泽东思想  指引我们力争上游刘雪峰
    （哈尔滨石油机械配件厂）
    毛主席和党中央向全国厂矿企业革命职工和革命干部发出的伟大战斗号召，极大地鼓舞着我厂广大革命职工和革命干部。大家立刻进行了座谈，我们决心以最大的努力保证实现我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央向我们提出的希望和要求。
    我们哈尔滨石油机械配件厂，从夺权以后，就一直忠实地执行着我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使生产面貌逐日发生变化。过去许多被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派瞧不起的工人，现在往往两倍甚至三倍地超额完成任务。今年以来，截至三月十一日，全厂已经完成了四月份的生产计划，预计到三月底可以完成五月份的计划。全体革命职工已经提出保证，今年的全年生产计划争取提前一个季度完成。产品质量也有了大幅度的提高。
    许多兄弟单位都称我们是抓革命、促生产的模范，但是我们感到我们做的还很不够。我们知道，只有进一步把毛主席著作学好用好，进一步用伟大的毛泽东思想把全体革命职工武装起来，全厂才能永远保持青春的活力，才能不断地创造出奇迹。正因为这样，我们坚持每周四小时学习毛主席著作，每星期六开一次讲用会，每天班前学《毛主席语录》。这些制度建立以来，促进了全厂职工的思想革命化。
    现在，毛主席和党中央向我们提出了新的战斗号召，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把革命和生产搞得好上加好。
    革命是闯将生产是模范
    李树森（北满钢厂工人）
    我们北满钢厂在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行坚决斗争的时候，那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙们，操纵御用组织，煽动不明真相的职工群众，脱离生产工作岗位，制造停产事故，妄图把无产阶级革命派整垮。全厂生产处于瘫痪状态，冶炼车间出完钢不能继续装料，修好的炉子也不能装料，车间内钢锭储存超出正常的二倍多。摆在我们无产阶级革命派面前有两条路：是让生产停下来呢？还是坚持生产呢？我们无产阶级革命派是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，深深印在每个革命者的脑子里。我们不仅要做革命的闯将，还要当生产的模范。无产阶级革命派以最大的革命热情，最大的干劲，主动地挑起革命和生产两副重担，夜以继日地战斗着。司机张恩孚，在人员紧张的情况下，充分发挥多面手作用。烧火、调车、扳道，四个人的活他一个人干。王树仁、马岭生同志，几天几夜吃睡在厂内，以厂为家，坚持日夜劳动。他们说：“宁愿我们千辛万苦，也不让生产一时为难。”保证了生产任务的完成。
    我们无产阶级革命派，在夺权以后，时刻都牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，及时成立了革命生产指挥部，健全生产指挥系统，并吸收了一个错误较轻的副厂长和一个副总工程师参加生产指挥，加强了对生产的组织领导，迅速地建立了生产新秩序。二月份全面超额完成了国家计划，三月份比二月份又有大幅度提高。
    毛主席和党中央又向全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部发出了新的号召。我们北满钢厂的无产阶级革命派，一定不辜负毛主席的希望，决心在新的条件下，鼓足更大的干劲，争取成为名副其实的抓革命、促生产的模范。
    批判资产阶级反动路线决不能手软姜凤珍
    （哈尔滨发电厂工人）
    从广播里听到《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，我一直热血沸腾，感情激动。这是我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席和党中央对我们的最大信任和鼓舞，这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳对我们发出的伟大战斗号召。我们工人阶级是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导力量，我们一定要在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，在新的条件下，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取做抓革命、促生产的模范。
    我们哈尔滨发电厂革命职工和革命干部，自从实行大联合从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺了权，生产已有显著变化。仅仅在夺权后的一个月里，就节约电六万四千度，节约用煤八百零七吨，并且发挥工人智慧，自己制成了一台电子铁磁探测器。但是，我们还不满足于这些成绩，我们完全有决心有信心去争取更大的胜利。
    我们一定要坚决执行以我们伟大领袖毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，狠狠批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。当前以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线已经取得决定性的胜利，但是阶级斗争会有反复，阶级敌人必然还会以各种形式向我们进行反扑，我们必须提高警惕。无产阶级同资产阶级的搏斗是一场你死我活的斗争，对走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线要彻底揭发，彻底批判，决不能手软。革命的“三结合”的
    领导班子最有威信
    于庆彬（哈尔滨锅炉厂工人）
    我看了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，感到欢欣鼓舞。毛主席和党中央在每一次斗争的关键时刻，都向我们指明方向，鼓舞我们前进。毛主席他老人家就好象在我们工厂，在我们身边。他老人家句句话都说到我们工人心坎里，使我们感到万分亲切。
    我们哈尔滨锅炉厂是实行“三结合”夺权的，怎样正确对待革命的“三结合”，曾经遇到不少阻力。这种阻力主要来自三个方面：
    第一、党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心自己的失败，他们在一边煽阴风、点鬼火，故意拉拢革命干部和革命群众下水，在群众中制造混乱。
    第二、地、富、反、坏、右分子趁机捣乱，制造假相，破坏革命的“三结合”，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    第三、来自革命群众中的错误思想，小团体主义、无政府主义、风头主义、经济主义等，主要是“私”字作怪。
    这些问题不解决，就不能建立一个革命的“三结合”权力机构，就不会有革命的新秩序，生产指标也不可能完成好。我们深深感到：建立一个革命的“三结合”领导班子是完成新形势下新任务的重要保证。
    我们未夺权的时候，有的部门指挥不灵，积极性调动不起来，党的方针、政策贯彻不下去，这是什么原因呢？是因为无产阶级权威没有建立起来，保字派消极怠工，不听你的。夺权以后，革命的“三结合”领导班子建立起来了，党的方针政策就能很快贯彻执行。我们还根据毛主席的教导，实行精兵简政，把脱产人员减掉了三分之二。这样既充实了生产第一线，又提高了工作效率。今年二月份，完成生产指标百分之一百零三；三月份的产值将达到历年来最高水平。
    革命的技术人员到生产第一线去
    孙宝生（哈尔滨卫健机械厂设计员）
    毛主席和党中央向我们全国厂矿企业革命职工和革命干部，发出了伟大的战斗号召。作为一个技术人员，我感到无比的兴奋和鼓舞。在这一伟大的任务面前，我坚决地拿出最大的热情，做一名抓革命促生产的闯将。过去我们做设计工作的，往往不注意到工人中去向工人学习他们的实际经验，而只凭自己的空想或照抄书本上的资料进行设计，这样是脱离实际的。今后我决心按照毛主席的教导，走向生产第一线，认真地向工人同志学习，同时密切地和使用单位相结合，更好地了解他们的需要，设计出更多更实用的新产品。
