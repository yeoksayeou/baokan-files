The U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Lodge, has been ousted again. In the revolving door of U.S. imperialist appointments in South Vietnam, this unlucky "Ambassador" completed his second term and ended his inglorious mission. This is another sign of the increasingly desperate situation of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam.

Johnson's announcement of Lodge's resignation was very brief, using only one sentence to say that he had "worked very well" in Saigon, thus brushing the matter aside. If compared with the long list of praises Johnson gave Lodge when he took office for the second time, one can see that Lodge's second term was a complete failure. Last summer, when introducing Lodge to the public, Johnson boasted that he was the "most qualified, most capable, and most experienced" in doing this kind of work, and a "talent" that "no other American can match."

Such a threefold "talent," who also worked "very well," why was he replaced? In short, Johnson's bourgeois politician's jargon is merely used to cover up the U.S. defeat in South Vietnam.

Lodge's second removal indicates the miserable defeat of U.S. imperialism on the battlefield in South Vietnam. Johnson initially removed Taylor because Taylor's "special warfare" had failed. Lodge advocated direct U.S. military involvement, bringing with him a self-proclaimed "new plan" to win the war. At the same time, Johnson began to "escalate gradually" militarily. The first step was to decide to immediately double the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam, from over 60,000 to over 135,000, in a fierce attempt to extinguish the anti-imperialist struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

However, reality is cruel. When, seven and a half months later, Lodge had to retreat from the stage again, the U.S. invading troops in South Vietnam, who were living in fear, were no longer over 60,000, but over 420,000. It is said that Westmoreland still insisted that Johnson must increase the number to 600,000. As for victory, there was not even a shadow. When Lodge stepped down for the second time, he could only comfort himself by saying, "We have not yet won," "We will not fail."

The U.S. invaders' war "escalation" has reached this point today, and the conclusion is still: "No victory!" This sentence is similar to McNamara's clever words a year ago, "We will not lose," both are "putting on a brave face." McNamara's words admitted the failure of "special warfare," while Lodge's words admitted that "gradual escalation" is also useless. The claim of "not failing" is merely self-deception.

Facing the defeat of U.S. troops in South Vietnam, Johnson is like an "ant on a hot pan," frantically looking for a way out but finding none.

At this moment, what other words can Johnson use to comfort himself? There are some. In appointing Lodge's successor, Bunker, he issued a statement saying that he now has the "most capable, most intelligent, most tenacious, and most experienced team that America can have." This fourfold "most" can be said to be an upgrade in adjectives.

It seems that Johnson, having run out of options, is about to place a bigger bet, continuing the war "escalation." However, the name of this threefold "most" talent under the command of U.S. imperialism, Lodge, has already been recorded in the most shameful page of U.S. military failure history. Now, the fate of this new fourfold "most" team that Johnson has reassembled, will it be better than Lodge's? Of course not. Johnson has upgraded in vocabulary, upgraded in military terms, and the result can only be an upgrade in defeat.

    相应升级
    郭叶
    美国驻南越“大使”洛奇又滚下台了。在美帝国主义走马灯式的南越换班戏中，这个倒霉的“大使”走完第二圈，便结束了他的不光彩的使命。这是美帝国主义在南越处境更加狼狈的又一标志。
    约翰逊宣布洛奇去职的声明非常简单，只用了一句他在西贡“工作得非常出色”的敷衍话，就把事情交代过去。如果同洛奇第二次登台时约翰逊讲的大串恭维话作个对照，那就可以看出洛奇这第二任使命是完成得很糟的。前年夏天，约翰逊在向公众介绍洛奇时，吹嘘他是“在做这种工作方面最有条件、最有资格和最有经验”、为“其他任何美国人所不及”的“干才”。
    这样一个三“最”的“干才”，而且工作又很“出色”，为什么却要加以撤换呢？说穿了，约翰逊的这些资产阶级政客的行话，无非是用来掩饰美国在南越的败局。
    洛奇的再一次被撤换，表明了美帝国主义在南越战场上的惨败。约翰逊当初撤泰勒的职，是因为泰勒主张的“特种战争”破产了。洛奇支持美军直接参战，他带了一个自吹能配合打赢战争的“新计划”走马上任。同时，约翰逊就在军事上开始“逐步升级”。第一个步骤就是，决定立即把侵越美军增加一倍多，从六万多人增到十三万五千多人，气势汹汹，妄图扑灭南越人民的反侵略斗争的怒火。
    可是，现实是冷酷无情的。当一年另七个多月后洛奇不得不夹着尾巴再次奉命退出舞台时，在南越提心吊胆过日子的美国侵略军已经不是六万多人，而是四十二万多人了。据说，威斯特摩兰还坚持要约翰逊非给增加到六十万人不可。至于胜利，则连影子也看不到。洛奇在再次下台时，只能自我安慰地说：“我们还没有胜利”，“我们也不会失败”。
    美国侵略者的战争“升级”，已经到了今天的地步，而结论还是：“没有胜利”！这句话同麦克纳马拉在一年多前讲的“不再打输”的妙语异曲同工，都是“打肿脸充胖子”。麦克纳马拉的话是承认“特种战争”的破产，而洛奇的话就是承认“逐步升级”照样没有用处。“不会失败”之说，不过是自欺欺人而已。
    面临着美军在南越的败局，约翰逊活象“热锅上的蚂蚁”一样，急得团团乱转，就是找不到一条出路。
    此时此刻，约翰逊还能用别的什么词汇来安慰自己呢？有的。他在任命洛奇的继任者邦克时发表声明说，他现在又配备了一个“美国能够有的最能干、最聪明、最顽强和最有经验的班子”。这个四“最”，可说是在形容词上又升了一级。
    看来，约翰逊走投无路，正打算投下更大的赌注，继续进行战争“升级”。可是，洛奇这员美帝国主义手下三“最”干将的名字，已载入了美国军事失败史上最可耻的一页。现在，约翰逊重新配备的这个四“最”的新班子的命运，难道会比洛奇更好一点吗？当然不会。约翰逊在词汇上升了级，在军事上升了级，结果只能是在败绩上也相应地升级。
