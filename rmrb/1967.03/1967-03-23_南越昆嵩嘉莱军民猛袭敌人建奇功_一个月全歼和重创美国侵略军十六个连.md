The liberation armed forces in the provinces of Kunshan and Gia Lai in South Vietnam launched a series of fierce attacks on the enemy from February 15 to March 14, achieving significant victories. According to statistics, they killed and wounded over 2,000 enemy soldiers (mostly American invaders), completely annihilated four American infantry companies and one puppet army company, severely damaged twelve American companies and a brigade command post, shot down twenty-four enemy aircraft, destroyed thirty-four military vehicles and twelve artillery pieces, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

On February 15, the liberation armed forces in Kunshan Province simultaneously launched fierce attacks on American military bases on both the east and west banks of the Sa Thay River and ambushed enemy reinforcements. They completely annihilated two American companies, severely damaged two more, shot down six helicopters, destroyed two military vehicles, and captured many weapons.

After suffering heavy losses from the liberation armed forces, the American aggressors hastily dispatched B-52 bombers to indiscriminately bomb the area. On February 21, they parachuted a company from the U.S. Fourth Infantry Division into a location 65 kilometers southwest of Kunshan City. Before the enemy soldiers could even stabilize their position, they were subjected to a fierce artillery barrage by the liberation armed forces that same night, resulting in their complete annihilation.

To salvage the situation, the American aggressors dispatched the U.S. First Cavalry Division for reinforcement. On March 3, as soon as this batch of American invaders arrived in the Sa Thay River area, they were met with a fierce counterattack from the liberation armed forces, resulting in over 180 American soldiers being killed, including two severely damaged companies.

After suffering consecutive defeats, the American aggressors hastily dispatched the U.S. 101st Airborne Division from Phan Rang. However, on the morning of March 12, as soon as a company from this division was parachuted into the eastern part of the Sa Thay River, they were immediately surrounded by the liberation armed forces. The liberation armed forces completely annihilated this company and severely damaged two other American companies that came to their rescue.

On the night of March 13, the liberation armed forces, riding on the momentum of victory, launched a fierce attack on American and puppet forces in the Chon Thanh area south of Bo Binh Long. They severely damaged three American companies and inflicted heavy casualties on an American brigade command post, killing and wounding 345 American invaders and 75 puppet soldiers. They also leveled an enemy artillery position and destroyed eight artillery pieces.

To support the fighting of the military and civilians in Kunshan Province, the military and civilians in Gia Lai Province also frequently launched attacks on the enemy along the southern part of Highway 19. According to statistics, in just a few battles from February 18 to early March, the military and civilians in Gia Lai Province completely annihilated one puppet special forces company and killed 40 enemy soldiers, destroying dozens of military vehicles and one artillery piece.

    南越昆嵩嘉莱军民猛袭敌人建奇功
    一个月全歼和重创美国侵略军十六个连
    新华社河内二十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方昆嵩和嘉莱两省解放武装力量，二月十五日到三月十四日，分别在沙太河地区和第十九号公路南面频频袭击敌人，取得重大战果。据统计，共打死打伤敌人二千多名（绝大部分是美国侵略军），其中包括全歼美国侵略军四个连和伪军一个连，重创美军十二个连和一个旅指挥所，击落敌机二十四架，击毁军车三十四辆和大炮十二门，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    二月十五日，昆嵩省解放武装力量在沙太河东、西两面同时猛烈袭击美军驻地和截击敌人的援军，全歼美国侵略军两个连，重创两个连，击落直升飞机六架，击毁军车二辆，缴获许多武器。
    美国强盗在遭到解放武装力量的打击之后，慌忙出动B—52型飞机滥炸，并于二月二十一日向昆嵩市西南六十五公里的地方空投美国第四步兵师的一个连。这连敌军着陆后还未站稳脚跟，就在当天夜间遭到解放武装力量的猛烈炮击，全部被歼。
    为了挽救败局，美国强盗又出动第一骑兵师前来增援。三月三日，这批美国侵略军刚来到沙太河地区，就遭到解放武装力量的迎头痛击，被打死一百八十多名，其中有两个连被重创。
    美国强盗在连续遭到惨败之后，又慌忙从藩朗市调来美国第一○一空降旅。但是，三月十二日上午，当这个旅的一个连被空投到沙太河东面的时候，立即遭到解放武装力量的包围。解放武装力量全部消灭了这个连，并且重创前来救援的另外两连美军。
    三月十三日夜间，解放武装力量又乘胜猛烈袭击波来吉浪以南崇善地区的美伪军，重创美军三个连，同时使美军一个旅的指挥所遭到重大伤亡，共打死打伤美国侵略军三百四十五名和伪军七十五名，夷平敌人一个炮兵阵地，击毁大炮八门。
    为了配合昆嵩省军民的战斗，嘉莱省军民在这期间也频频在第十九号公路南面出击敌人。据统计，仅在二月十八到三月初的几次战斗中，嘉莱省军民就全歼伪军一个别动连和打死敌人四十名，击毁军车成十辆和大炮一门。（附图片）
    英雄的越南南方解放军战士胜利向前挺进。
