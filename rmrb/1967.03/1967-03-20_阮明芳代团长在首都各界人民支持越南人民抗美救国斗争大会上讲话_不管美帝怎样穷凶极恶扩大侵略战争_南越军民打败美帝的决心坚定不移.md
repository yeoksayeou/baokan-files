We, on behalf of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, extend our warmest greetings to you. On the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the March 19th National Anti-American Day of Vietnam, the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Asian and African Countries, and various Chinese people's organizations have solemnly held a rally to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. We express our heartfelt thanks for this. We welcome the foreign friends attending this meeting. Please allow us to convey the fighting friendship and solidarity of the people of South Vietnam to you and to the people of your countries.

Friends,

Seventeen years ago, on March 19, 1950, the people of South Vietnam opened the heroic chapter of their struggle against the interference and aggression of American imperialism. At that time, the French expeditionary forces suffered heavy defeats on various battlefields in Vietnam, and American imperialism stepped in to interfere in Vietnam, actively supporting the French colonialists to prolong and expand the war of aggression. American imperialism provided the French colonialists with $260 million, tens of tons of weapons and war materials, and a large number of military advisors. On March 18, 1950, the American interventionists sent two minesweepers and seventy fighter planes to Saigon, attempting to hold naval and air exercises in Saigon to show off their strength and intimidate the will of the people of South Vietnam, and to back up the French colonialists. This blatant act of intervention was immediately exposed and smashed by the people of South Vietnam. On the night of March 18, 1950, the people's armed forces bombarded the American warships anchored in the port of Saigon with mortars. On the morning of March 19, 500,000 people in Saigon, led by the current Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Lawyer Nguyen Huu Tho, took to the streets in a massive demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" and "American imperialism get out!" They tore down the American flag and drove away the American sailors. The enemy sent police, gendarmes, and even foreign legions, tanks, and armored cars to suppress the demonstrators with tear gas. However, the demonstrators bravely rushed forward, one after another, unstoppable. The American imperialists' plan to show off their strength was smashed. That night, the American warships hurriedly and quietly slipped away from the port of Saigon. The people of Saigon's heroic struggle achieved complete victory, carrying forward the unyielding tradition of the Vietnamese nation and opening the first glorious page in the history of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism.

Since then, the people of South Vietnam have never stopped fighting. They have carried forward the heroic tradition and fighting spirit of March 19, overcoming all difficulties and hardships to resolutely struggle for independence and freedom. In the nine-year war of resistance against French colonialist invaders and American interventionists, the people of South Vietnam were at the forefront, contributing greatly to the national victory, the heroic chapter of Dien Bien Phu, and the liberation of North Vietnam. For the past twelve years, since American imperialism replaced the French colonialists to directly rule South Vietnam and turned it into a new type of colony and military base in Southeast Asia, the people of South Vietnam have been resisting the American invaders and their lackeys. They have fought bravely and achieved great victories: the American imperialists' strategy of using the fascist dictatorship they had set up in South Vietnam to carry out neo-colonialist war was defeated, the American imperialists' "special war" strategy was defeated, and the American strategy of waging "limited war" with nearly 500,000 American troops and allied forces and 500,000 puppet troops was also defeated.

From 1961 to 1966, the military and people of South Vietnam rendered more than a million enemy troops combat ineffective, including 130,597 American invaders. Since early 1965, when large numbers of American expeditionary forces entered South Vietnam, they suffered extremely heavy defeats. Over 120,000 American soldiers, 10,000 allied troops, and 100,000 puppet troops were annihilated. In 1966, the number of American troops annihilated was four times that of 1965. Now, the American imperialists are concentrating their forces on the second dry season counteroffensive plan, using one to two times more troops and weapons than the beginning of the dry season last year, attempting to reverse the situation. However, the military and people of South Vietnam have given them fierce blows in places such as Xuan Loc, Bien Hoa, Binh Duong, Long An, Gia Dinh, Tan Phu, Kon Tum, Binh Dinh, Quang Ngai, Quang Nam, Da Nang, and Qui Nhon, causing them extremely heavy losses.

To carry out its second "dry season counteroffensive plan," from February 24, 1967, to the present, the Americans have conducted a large-scale "sweeping" operation in Xuan Loc Province. In this "sweeping" operation, the liberation army annihilated nearly 5,000 American invaders, destroyed more than 400 military vehicles, and shot down nearly 100 aircraft. All participating American regiments and brigades were severely damaged, and all enemy "sweeping" operations, large and small, were smashed. The enemy's strongholds were continuously attacked, and the enemy's lifelines were cut off. Around the American military bases, a solid area for annihilating the Americans has been established. The people's war is flourishing. The military and people of South Vietnam have simultaneously launched armed struggle, political struggle, and enemy work against the enemy, continuously launching offensives, firmly grasping the initiative on the battlefield. At the same time, the military and people of North Vietnam, with the determination to defeat the American aggressors, closely cooperated with the military and people of South Vietnam, shooting down 1,720 American aircraft and capturing many American pilots, gradually defeating the enemy's destructive war.

The victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in the past are the victories of their hatred for the American aggressors, their strong patriotism, their tenacious fighting will, and their wisdom and creativity. This is the victory of the only true representative of 14 million people in South Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the sacred organizer and leader of the people's war of national salvation against American aggression.

Friends,

Facing a series of heavy defeats, American imperialism has not given up its aggressive ambitions. Now, it is hurriedly sending more troops, weapons, and war materials into South Vietnam, expanding the war of aggression. In South Vietnam, the number of American expeditionary forces has exceeded 420,000, and the number of American mercenaries has exceeded 55,000. Compared to 1965, the number of American troops in South Vietnam has increased by more than sixteen times, and other war materials have increased by dozens of times. Relying on more than a million aggressors and mercenaries equipped with modern war equipment, American imperialism is vigorously implementing the "kill all, burn all, destroy all" policy in South Vietnam, committing extremely barbaric crimes, which has aroused the indignation of all people of conscience in the world. American imperialism has universally and on an increasingly large scale used weapons banned by international law, such as napalm, various chemical poisons, and poison gas. American imperialism uses B-52 bombers to indiscriminately bomb residential areas, causing tens of thousands of civilian casualties, thousands of people killed by poison gas, and thousands of villages destroyed, leveled, and burned. In some places, such as An Phu village in Quang Ngai Province, even women and children were all massacred. In North Vietnam, American imperialism directly bombs economic zones, residential areas, schools, hospitals, nurseries, and dams. More seriously, American imperialism has recently implemented a new and extremely dangerous "escalation" step: shelling the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from the south of the demilitarized zone with cannons, shelling coastal areas with warships, and laying mines in many rivers in North Vietnam, committing new crimes against the Vietnamese people.

Currently, the American aggressors' leader Johnson and the highest-ranking officials in the American war machine, along with their lackeys Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, are gathering on the distant island of Guam, 3,000 kilometers away from Vietnam, to discuss new military adventurist measures to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. At the same time, the United States is also planning to convene meetings of the ANZUS Treaty and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to urge its vassal states to further intervene in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam resolutely condemn these American imperialist war conferences and are determined to smash the American bandits' new war "escalation" with their spirit and material strength.

Not only that, American imperialism has also expanded its war of aggression against Laos, seriously violating the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question, and repeatedly launching provocative attacks on the Kingdom of Cambodia, violating Cambodia's independence and neutrality, and seriously threatening the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia. On February 27, 1967, the head of the White House, Johnson, personally publicly declared that their actions are "stronger actions," which is a new step by the United States to expand the conflict, and this action is "carefully considered and debated." Johnson also claimed that the United States' new military measures are "not escalation but the best way to seek peace." It is precisely when American imperialism is taking extremely brutal military actions in Vietnam and deliberately spreading the flames of war to the entire Indochina Peninsula that they are talking endlessly about "peace talks" and shouting "peace sincerity," attempting to deceive public opinion and cover up their crimes. They are also repeating the shameful argument that they are waging war in Vietnam to "maintain American security," to "fulfill the promise of protecting freedom" to the Saigon puppet government, and to "oppose" the "aggression" of North Vietnam, to defend their colonialist policy of aggression and to erase the people's war of national salvation in South Vietnam, refusing to recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. However, the war-mongering rhetoric of the Johnson clique is deceiving no one and, on the contrary, making them more isolated. Currently, American imperialism is taking extremely brutal military measures to intensify and expand the war of aggression, but it cannot escape the passive and failing situation. The more American troops are sent to South Vietnam, the more they die, and the more they sink into the sea of people's war. The more American imperialism expands the war, the greater its difficulties in manpower, logistics, and finance, and the more its political and military weaknesses are exposed. On the contrary, the military and people of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and stronger, and their victories are becoming greater and greater, and they will surely achieve final victory. No matter how American imperialism threatens and deceives, the military and people of South Vietnam are determined to concentrate all their strength to defeat it and to achieve the sacred wish of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the country. The February 28, 1967, statement of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam solemnly reaffirmed the position of the 14 million people of South Vietnam as stated in the five-point statement of March 22, 1965, and clearly pointed out that "the people of South Vietnam love peace very much, but as long as there are American aggressor troops in their beloved country, they will never lay down their arms at any time." This is the iron will and unshakable determination of the military and people of South Vietnam.

Friends,

The Vietnamese people's brilliant struggle for justice has won the warm sympathy and support of the people of the world, including the American people. The movement to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation is growing stronger and more widespread. The March 19th National Anti-American Day of Vietnam has become a day of global support for the Vietnamese people. This is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people. The people of South Vietnam are deeply grateful to the brothers and friends from the five continents who enthusiastically support us. We are determined to defeat the American aggressors and make an active contribution to the common struggle of the people of the world for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress.

Friends,

China and Vietnam are neighboring countries with a fate of life and death. The Chinese people, with a high sense of internationalism, are not afraid of any sacrifice to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and have given the people of South Vietnam extremely great and effective assistance. Recently, facing the American imperialists' plot and actions to intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Chinese government and twelve mass organizations issued statements expressing the determination of 700 million Chinese people to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support the Vietnamese people, defeat American imperialism, and strive for final victory. The Vietnamese people highly appreciate this invaluable support. It is precisely the resolute support of 700 million Chinese people and the increasingly great support of brotherly countries and friends from all over the world that have made a great contribution to the brilliant victories of the people of South Vietnam.

On this occasion, I, on behalf of the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, once again express our deep and sincere thanks to the 700 million Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Communist Party of China led by the respected Chairman Mao.

Friends,

For the past seventeen years, the process of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression has been a process of heroic struggle and glorious victory. The victories of the Vietnamese people have proven the unshakable truth of our time: a nation, no matter how small, as long as it has a correct political line, wages a people's war, unites, and is determined to fight for national independence and the unification of the country, it will have sufficient strength to smash any imperialist plot and act of aggression, no matter how numerous their numbers or how modern their equipment.

The people of South Vietnam have inherited the unyielding tradition of the Vietnamese nation's struggle against invaders and have thoroughly carried forward the immortal spirit of the March 19th National Anti-American Day and the spirit of decisive battle and victory. They are determined, together with their flesh-and-blood compatriots in the North, to advance and give the enemy even heavier blows, to achieve even greater victories, and to thoroughly fulfill the sacred mission of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately unifying the country.

The Vietnamese people will surely win! The American imperialists will surely fail!

South Vietnam will surely be liberated, and Vietnam will surely be unified!

Long live the eternal fighting friendship and unity between the people of South Vietnam and the people of China!

    阮明芳代团长在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上讲话
    不管美帝怎样穷凶极恶扩大侵略战争
    南越军民打败美帝的决心坚定不移
    新华社十九日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上的讲话
    我们代表越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团谨向你们转达越南南方人民最热烈的敬意。值此
  “三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日十七周年之际，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会和中国各人民团体隆重地举行了“支持越南人民抗美救国斗争”大会，对此，我们表示衷心的感谢。我们欢迎出席这个大会的各位外国朋友。请允许我们向你们，并向贵国人民转达越南南方人民战斗的友谊和团结的敬意。
    各位朋友们：
    十七年前，即一九五○年三月十九日，越南南方人民揭开了反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的壮烈斗争史篇。当时，法国远征军在越南各个战场上遭到惨重的失败，美帝国主义便出面干涉越南，积极支持法国殖民主义者继续延长和扩大侵略战争。美帝国主义向法国殖民主义者提供了二十六亿美元，数以十吨计的武器和战争物资以及大批军事顾问。一九五○年三月十八日，美国干涉者又派遣两艘扫雷舰和七十架战斗机到西贡，妄图在西贡举行海空军演习，炫耀它们的实力，企图威胁越南南方人民的斗志，为法国殖民主义者撑腰。它们的这种明目张胆的干涉行动立即为越南南方人民所揭露和粉碎。一九五○年三月十八日夜间，人民武装力量用迫击炮轰击停泊在西贡港的美国军舰。三月十九日上午，西堤五十万人民在现任越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿律师的率领下，结队上街举行声势浩大的示威游行，高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“美帝国主义滚回去”等口号，并扯下美国国旗，赶走美国水兵。敌人出动警察宪兵，外籍兵团甚至派遣坦克、装甲车，用催泪弹来镇压示威游行队伍。但是，参加游行的群众英勇地冲向前去，前赴后继，势不可挡。美帝国主义炫耀实力的计划被粉碎了。当天晚上，美国军舰急急忙忙地静悄悄地从西贡港溜走了。西堤人民的英勇斗争取得了完全胜利，它发扬了越南民族坚强不屈的传统，揭开了越南人民反对美帝国主义的光荣斗争历史的第一页。
    从此，越南南方人民一刻也没有停止过斗争，他们发扬“三·一九”的英雄传统和英勇斗争精神，不顾一切艰难困苦，坚决争取独立和自由。在越南全体人民反抗法国殖民主义侵略者和美国干涉者的九年抗战中，越南南方人民走在最前列，他们为全国的胜利，为奠边府的英雄史篇，为解放越南北方作出了巨大的贡献。十二年来，即自美帝国主义取代法国殖民主义者直接统治越南南方、把越南南方变成它在东南亚的新型殖民地和军事基地以来，越南南方人民一直在反抗美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗，他们打得很英勇，并且取得了很大的胜利：美帝国主义企图利用它扶植起来的吴庭艳法西斯独裁统治来推行新殖民主义的战略被打败了，美帝国主义的“特种战争”战略被打败了，美国以将近五十万美军和仆从国家军队以及五十万伪军进行“局部战争”的战略也被打败了。
    自一九六一年至一九六六年六年中，越南南方军民使一百多万敌军失去了战斗力，其中包括十三万零五百九十七名美国侵略者。一九六五年初以来，美国大批远征军进入南越，也就是在这个时候，它遭受了极其惨重的失败，被歼灭的美军达十二万多名，仆从国家军队一万名，伪军成十万名。一九六六年内被歼美军比一九六五年增加四倍。现在，美帝国主义者正集中力量于第二个旱季战略反攻计划，它使用的兵力和武器比去年旱季初期增加一到两倍，企图挽救败局。但是，越南南方军民在西宁、边和、堤岸、龙平、嘉定、新山一、昆嵩、平定、广义、广南、岘港、治天等地给予它猛烈的打击，使它遭受了极其严重的损失。
    美国为执行它的第二个“旱季反攻计划”，从一九六七年二月二十四日到现在，在西宁省进行一次大规模的“扫荡”。在这次“扫荡”中，解放军歼灭了近五千名美国侵略者，击毁了四百多辆军车，击落了近一百架飞机。所有参战的美国师、旅部队都被打得残缺不全，敌人大小规模的“扫荡”都被粉碎了。美伪的巢穴遭到连续进攻，美伪的交通命脉被切断。在美军基地周围，已经建立了一个坚固的歼美地带。人民战争正在蓬勃发展。越南南方军民对敌人同时展开了武装斗争，政治斗争和敌军工作，连续发动攻势，牢牢地掌握了战场上的主动权。与此同时，越南北方军民，以战胜美国侵略强盗的决心，同越南南方军民密切配合，击落了一千七百二十多架美机，活捉了许多美国飞行员，逐步地打败敌人的破坏性战争。
    越南南方军民过去所取得的胜利，是他们对美国侵略强盗的仇恨，强烈的爱国主义精神、顽强的战斗意志和充满机智及创造精神的胜利。这是一千四百万越南南方人民唯一的真正的代表、越南南方人民神圣的抗美救国战争的组织者和领导者——越南南方民族解放阵线正确的革命路线的胜利。
    朋友们：
    美帝国主义面对着一系列沉重的失败，还不肯放弃侵略的野心。现在，它正加紧把更多的军队、武器和战争物资运进越南南方，扩大侵略战争。在越南南方，美国远征军已超过四十二万名，美国的仆从军已超过五万五千名。同一九六五年比较，在越南南方的美军已经增加十六倍多，其他战争物资也增加了几十倍。美帝国主义仗着一百多万拥有现代化战争装备的侵略军和雇佣军，在越南南方大力推行“杀光、毁光和烧光”的三光政策，犯下了极其野蛮的罪行，对此，世界上任何有良知的人无不感到愤慨。美帝国主义普遍地、规模越来越大地使用了国际法律早已禁止的杀人武器，如凝固汽油弹、各种化学毒剂和毒气。美帝国主义使用Ｂ—52型飞机对居民区进行狂轰滥炸，使数十万和平居民遭到伤亡，其中有成千人被毒气毒死，成千个村庄被破坏、夷平和烧毁。有的地方如广义省安福村连妇女和儿童都全部被他们残杀了。在越南北方，美帝国主义对经济区、居民区、学校、医院、托儿所、堤坝等直接进行狂轰滥炸。更加严重的是最近美帝国主义又推行新的极其危险的“升级”步骤：从非军事区南边用大炮轰击越南民主共和国的领土，用军舰炮轰沿海地区，在越南北方的许多河流投放水雷，从而对越南人民犯下了新的罪行。
    目前，美国侵略者的头子约翰逊和美国战争机构中的最高级人物及其走狗阮文绍、阮高其正纠合在远离越南三千公里的关岛开会，商讨强化和扩大侵略越南战争的新的军事冒险措施。同时，美国也正在策划召开美澳新条约和东南亚条约组织会议，以便促使其仆从国更多地介入侵略越南的战争。越南南方人民坚决谴责这些美帝国主义的战争会议，并决心以自己的精神和物质力量粉碎美国强盗的新的战争“升级”。
    不仅如此，美帝国主义还扩大对老挝的侵略战争，严重破坏一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，不断地向柬埔寨王国发动挑衅性的进攻，破坏柬埔寨王国的独立和中立，严重威胁印度支那和东南亚的和平。一九六七年二月二十七日，白宫的头子约翰逊亲自公开声称他们的行动是“更强有力的行动”，这是美国使冲突扩大化的一个新步骤，而且这一行动是“经过认真的考虑和辩论”的，约翰逊还表白什么美国这一新的军事措施“不是升级而是寻求和平的最好的途径”。就是在美帝国主义在越南采取极其残暴的战争行动，蓄意把战火扩大到整个印度支那的时候，他们却滔滔不绝地谈论“和平谈判”，叫嚷“和平诚意”，妄图欺骗舆论，掩盖他们的罪行。他们还重弹可耻的论调，说什么他们在越南进行战争是为了“维护美国的安全”，对西贡伪政权“履行保护自由的诺言”，“反对”北越的“侵略”，来为他们的殖民主义侵略政策辩护，抹煞越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争，拒不承认越南南方民族解放阵线。但是约翰逊好战集团的一切骗人、蛮横的论调是骗不了人的，相反，使它更加孤立。目前美帝国主义采取极其残暴的军事措施来加紧扩大侵略战争，但它绝不能摆脱被动和失败的局面。派往南越的美军越多，他们死的也就越多，越是沉没在人民战争的火海中。美帝国主义越是扩大战争，它的兵源、后勤、财政方面的困难就越大，它的政治和军事上的基本弱点也就更加暴露。相反，越南南方军民越战越强，越强胜利越大，而且一定取得最后的胜利。不管美帝国主义怎样威胁和欺骗，越南南方军民坚决集中全力打败它，坚决实现解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的神圣愿望。越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六七年二月二十八日的声明，庄严重申了一九六五年三月二十二日的五点声明中所阐明的一千四百万越南南方人民的立场，并明确指出“越南南方人民非常热爱和平，但是，当他们可爱的祖国还有美国侵略军的时候，是任何时候也决不会放下武器”。这是越南南方军民的钢铁意志和坚定不移的决心。
      朋友们：
    越南人民光辉的正义斗争得到了包括美国人民在内的全世界人民的热烈同情和支持。支援越南抗美救国斗争的运动正在日益壮大和广泛地发展。“三·一九”越南全国反美日已成为全世界声援越南人民反美日。这是对越南人民的巨大鼓舞。越南南方人民十分感谢热情地支持我们的五大洲的兄弟朋友们，我们决心打败美国侵略者，为世界人民争取民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步的共同斗争作出积极的贡献。
    朋友们：
    中国和越南是唇齿相依的邻邦，两个民族生死存亡的命运把我们紧紧地联结在一起。中国人民以高度的国际主义精神，不惜任何牺牲支援越南的抗美救国斗争，已经给予越南南方人民极其巨大和有效的援助。最近，面对美帝国主义对越南加紧扩大侵略战争的阴谋和行动，中国政府和中国十二个群众团体发表了声明，表示七亿中国人民的决心，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支援越南人民，打败美帝国主义，争取最后胜利。越南人民对这种无比宝贵的支援给予了很高的评价。正是七亿中国人民的坚决支持，以及各兄弟国家和全世界朋友们日益巨大的支持，为越南南方人民的辉煌胜利作出了重大贡献。
    借此机会，我代表越南南方人民，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会向七亿中国人民、中华人民共和国政府和以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党再一次表示深切的衷心的感谢。
    朋友们：
    十七年来，越南人民反美斗争的过程是一个英勇战斗、光荣胜利的过程。越南人民的胜利证明了我们当代颠扑不破的真理：一个民族尽管弱小，但只要它有正确的政治路线，进行人民战争，团结起来，决心为民族独立、统一祖国而战斗，那末，它就有足够的力量来粉碎任何帝国主义的阴谋和侵略行动，不管他们的人数如何众多，武器装备如何现代化。
    越南南方人民继承了越南民族反抗侵略者的不屈斗争传统，彻底发扬不朽的“三·一九”全国反美日的英雄传统和决战决胜的精神，决心和骨肉的北方同胞一起，冲向前去，给予敌人以更加沉重的打击，争取更加巨大的胜利，彻底完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的神圣义务。
    越南人民必胜！美帝必败！
    越南南方一定要解放，越南一定要统一！
    越南南方人民和中国人民之间的永恒的战斗友谊和团结万岁！
