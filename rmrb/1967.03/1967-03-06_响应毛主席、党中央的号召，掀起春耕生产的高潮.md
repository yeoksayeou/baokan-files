The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" is a document of great significance. Chairman Mao and the Central Committee call on the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres to earnestly grasp the revolution and promote production, mobilize all forces, and immediately work hard to ensure a good spring ploughing and production campaign, launching a spring ploughing and production high tide.

This great call has been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, cadres at all levels in rural people's communes, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. This great call is being transformed into a tremendous material force through the practice of the broad masses.

"Grasp the revolution and promote production" is the consistent strategic thinking of our great leader Chairman Mao. Today, we must resolutely implement this strategic thinking of Chairman Mao in the countryside, firmly grasp the revolution, promote the ideological transformation of the people, and drive the development of agricultural production. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The quality of agricultural production directly affects the construction of the country and the lives of the people. The situation of agricultural production this year has a great bearing on the successful development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Spring ploughing and production is the most crucial link in the annual agricultural production. Currently, it is the peak season for spring production. Chairman Mao has always taught us that all rural work must "pay attention to the seasons" and "not violate the agricultural calendar." The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes must use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to seize the opportunity and launch the first shot of the spring ploughing and production campaign, laying a good foundation for achieving a bumper harvest throughout the year.

The poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for grasping the revolution and promoting production in the countryside. They listen to Chairman Mao the most and follow the Party's leadership the most. In the current spring ploughing and production, they will definitely unite under the great call of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, take the lead, shoulder the heavy responsibilities, and carry forward the spirit of being the masters of the house.

To ensure a good spring ploughing and production, the key issue at present is to correctly handle the cadres. Cadres must be analyzed from a class perspective. The vast majority of cadres at all levels in rural people's communes are good or relatively good. They are mostly from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, support the Party, love Chairman Mao, and are determined to follow the socialist road. If cadres are indiscriminately made to step aside, that would be extremely wrong. Good and relatively good cadres should be trusted and supported. Cadres who have made mistakes should be criticized seriously according to Chairman Mao's consistent policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," helping them correct their mistakes and working together with them to ensure a good spring ploughing and production.

Cadres at all levels in rural people's communes bear a heavy responsibility in ensuring the current spring ploughing and production. They should resolutely follow the instructions of the Central Committee and actively lead the spring ploughing and production. Whether they can do this is a test for every rural cadre.

Currently, many comrades in the cadres at all levels in rural people's communes are on the front line of spring ploughing and production, working hard to ensure a good spring ploughing and production. However, some comrades have incorrect thoughts that hinder them from actively leading the spring ploughing and production.

Some cadres have a "grievance" in their minds. They are burdened by big-character posters from the masses and slacken their leadership over production. This is wrong. The revolutionary masses posting big-character posters and giving criticisms to cadres is a good thing. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism from anyone. No matter who it is, if you point out our mistakes, we will correct them. If your suggestions are good for the people, we will adopt them." A true revolutionary should not be afraid of the masses' criticism and hide their shortcomings. They should welcome the revolutionary masses' criticism with enthusiasm, persist in what is good for the people, and correct what is wrong for the people. Only by doing so can one be a good comrade and gain the trust and support of the masses.

Some cadres have a "fear" in their minds. They fear that leading production will be seen as suppressing democracy, fear that the masses will not trust their leadership, and fear that the masses will seize on any mistakes made in work. Thus, they let production run wild, even to the point of abandoning it. These comrades fear this and that, actually fearing the masses and not believing in them. Ultimately, it is the "self" that is at work. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe in the masses, and we should believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." Practice has proven that the masses can distinguish right from wrong. These comrades, if they can get rid of selfish thoughts and bravely stand up, lead production, and do a good job in production, the masses will support them.

Cadres at all levels in rural people's communes should seriously arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, break down the "self," establish the "public," and wholeheartedly serve the people. In their work, they should firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite with all laboring masses, and be good at consulting with the poor and lower-middle peasants and all laboring masses on matters. Cadres who have made mistakes should redouble their efforts in the spring ploughing and production to make amends.

Currently, the People's Liberation Army is enthusiastically responding to the call of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, following the instructions of the Military Commission, actively helping local people's communes to grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, and contributing to the victory of the spring ploughing and production campaign. This is a great encouragement and support for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes.

Industry, transportation, finance and trade, and all departments related to agricultural production should make actively supporting the spring ploughing and production a key task, and do a good job in all aspects of supporting the spring ploughing and production.

We must be vigilant against and strengthen supervision over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They must be allowed to behave properly, and if they cause trouble, they must be punished immediately.

The poor and lower-middle peasants should unite, and the poor and lower-middle peasants and all laboring masses and revolutionary cadres should unite. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will grasp the revolution, promote production, achieve victory in the spring ploughing and production campaign, and strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year!

    响应毛主席、党中央的号召，掀起春耕生产的高潮
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，是一个具有重大意义的文件。毛主席、党中央号召贫下中农和农村工作干部，认真地抓革命，促生产，动员一切力量，立即为做好春耕生产而积极工作，掀起一个春耕生产的高潮。
    这个伟大的号召，获得了广大贫下中农、农村人民公社各级干部和人民解放军指战员的热烈响应。这个伟大的号召，正在通过广大群众的实践，变为巨大的物质力量。
    “抓革命，促生产”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席的一贯的战略思想。今天，我们在农村要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的这个战略思想，要狠抓革命，促进人的思想革命化，推动农业生产的发展。农业是国民经济的基础。农业生产的好坏，直接影响国家的建设和人民的生活。今年农业生产的状况如何，对于无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，有着极大的关系。
    春耕生产是全年农业生产中最关紧要的环节。当前，正处在春季生产大忙时节。毛主席历来教导我们，一切农村工作“必须注意季节”，要“不违农时”。农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部一定要用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，不失时机地打响春耕生产第一炮，为夺取全年农业大丰收奠定一个好基础。
    贫下中农是农村中抓革命、促生产的主力军。他们最听毛主席的话，最听党的领导。在当前春耕生产中，他们一定会在毛主席和党中央的伟大号召下，团结起来，扛大梁，挑重担，发扬当家作主的精神。
    为了搞好春耕生产，当前的一个关键问题，是正确地对待干部。对干部要作阶级分析。农村人民公社各级干部，绝大多数是好的和比较好的。他们绝大多数出身于贫下中农，是拥护党，热爱毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路的。如果不加区别地让干部一律靠边站，那是极端错误的。对于好的和比较好的干部，应该信赖他们，支持他们。对于犯了错误的干部，应该按照毛主席一贯坚持的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，进行严肃批评，帮助他们改正错误，同他们一起搞好春耕生产。
    农村人民公社各级干部，在抓好当前春耕生产中，担负着重大的责任。他们应该坚决按照党中央的指示，积极领导春耕生产。能否这样做，对每一个农村工作干部是一场考验。
    目前，在农村人民公社各级干部中，许多同志站在春耕生产第一线，正为搞好春耕生产而积极工作。但是，也有些同志存在着不正确的思想，妨碍他们去积极领导春耕生产。
    有的干部脑子里存在一个“怨”字。群众给他们贴了大字报，就背上包袱，放松了对生产的领导。这是不对的。革命群众给干部贴大字报，提意见，这是好事。毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”一个真正的革命者，决不应该害怕群众的批评，讳疾忌医。应该按照毛主席的教导，对革命群众的批评抱热情欢迎的态度，为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。只有这样做，才是一个好同志，才会取得群众的信任和支持。
    有的干部脑子里存在一个“怕”字。他们怕把指挥生产说成是压制民主，怕领导生产群众信不过，怕工作上出了点差错群众揪住不放。于是，就对生产放任自流，甚至撒手不管。这些同志怕这怕那，实际上是怕群众，不相信群众。归根结底，是一个“私”字在作怪。毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”事实证明，群众是能够分清是非的。这些同志只要去掉私心杂念，勇敢地站起来，领导生产，搞好生产，群众是会支持的。
    农村人民公社各级干部，都要认真地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，全心全意为人民服务。在工作中要坚定地依靠贫下中农，团结一切劳动群众，有事善于同贫下中农一起商量，同一切劳动群众一起商量。犯过错误的干部，应该在春耕生产中加倍努力工作，将功补过。
  目前，人民解放军正在热烈响应毛主席和党中央的号召，按照军委的指示，积极帮助当地人民公社狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取春耕生产的胜利贡献力量。这对广大贫下中农和农村人民公社各级干部是一个极大的鼓舞和支持。
    工业、交通、财贸以及一切与农业生产有关的部门，都应该把积极支援春耕生产作为当前工作的一个重点，切实做好支援春耕生产的各项工作。
    对地、富、反、坏、右分子必须提高警惕，加强监督。只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动，如要乱说乱动，立即予以制裁。
    贫下中农团结起来，贫下中农和一切劳动群众、革命干部团结起来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，夺取春耕生产的胜利，为争取全年的农业大丰收而奋斗！
