On March 15, 1966, Comrade Liu Yingjun, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, sacrificed his young life to protect the safety of the people. A year has passed. Liu Yingjun's efforts to study, implement, and propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts, and his courage in defending the brilliant image of Mao Zedong Thought, have always been in people's hearts. In the great, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, he has become a force inspiring the revolutionary people to advance.

Thirty years ago, Chairman Mao proposed: "We need to cultivate a large number of people. These people are the vanguard of the revolution. These people have political foresight. These people are full of fighting spirit and spirit of self-sacrifice. These people are open-hearted, loyal, active, and upright. These people do not seek personal gain but only strive for the liberation of the nation and society. These people are not afraid of difficulties and are always steadfast and brave in the face of difficulties. These people are not arrogant but are practical and have a spirit of realism. China needs a large number of such vanguard fighters. Only then can the tasks of the Chinese revolution be successfully accomplished."

Liu Yingjun, with his revolutionary and fighting life, showed that he, like Zhang Zide, Liu Huilan, Lei Feng, and others, is the kind of person our great leader expects and cultivates. He set a good example of thought revolutionization for us.

Liu Yingjun's thought revolutionization is concentrated in his unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Currently, the proletarian cultural revolution has entered a new stage, reaching a critical moment of decisive battle between the two classes and two lines. At this time, learning from Liu Yingjun's most precious quality has more important and practical significance.

	(I)

Chairman Mao proposed that the first condition for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause is: "They must be genuine Marxists-Leninists, not like Khrushchev, who hangs out the sign of Marxism-Leninism but is a revisionist."

Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's instructions and combined with the actual situation of our army, proposed three standards for cultivating and selecting cadres. The first standard is: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be loyal to Chairman Mao, and be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, being loyal to Chairman Mao, and being loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, for us proletarian revolutionaries, is a fundamental issue of direction and stance, a matter of great principle. Liu Yingjun stood out particularly in this regard.

Liu Yingjun had an unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao. He always longed for Chairman Mao.

Liu Yingjun had an unshakable belief in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "Chairman Mao's works are like the sun, with every word and sentence shining with golden light, illuminating the hearts of soldiers, and guiding work and study. 'Thousands of rivers flow eastward, and tens of thousands of stars point northward. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world!' He firmly believed that all revolutionary people of the world would unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march towards victory, just as the surging rivers flow into the Eastern Sea. This is the inevitable trend of historical development, and no force can stop it.

Liu Yingjun had the most sincere and profound class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He admonished himself: "If you forget Chairman Mao's words, it is as if you have forgotten your past sufferings and your responsibilities." In his view, the past thousand sufferings, ten thousand sufferings, without Mao Zedong Thought, were the greatest sufferings; today's thousand joys, ten thousand joys, with Mao Zedong Thought, were the greatest joys; revolutionary warriors had a thousand responsibilities, ten thousand responsibilities, and following Chairman Mao's instructions was the most fundamental responsibility.

What is particularly precious is that Liu Yingjun, in the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines, dared to defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, showing unlimited loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

When the ghosts and snakes in society created public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration and launched one arrow after another to attack Mao Zedong Thought, Liu Yingjun was filled with righteous indignation and resolutely fought back, standing firm against the class enemy.

When a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists hidden within the Party did everything they could to resist Mao Zedong Thought and limit its spread, Liu Yingjun took a combative stance, opposing them head-on and enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy every position.

When the revolutionary construction of the army was once hit by the bourgeois military line, Liu Yingjun bravely stood up and fought uncompromisingly, resolutely resisting and opposing the bourgeois military line, and steadfastly implementing Chairman Mao's military line.

Liu Yingjun followed Chairman Mao's teachings, being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to oneself. He followed Chairman Mao's instructions on distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, being principled and good at uniting comrades in dealing with internal issues among the people. When some comrades did not understand his struggle at the time and advised him not to persist, he felt that this was a matter of direction and had to continue the struggle. When someone went too far in criticizing him, he calmly analyzed it, believing it was a matter of understanding and forgiving it, not expanding the contradictions. When others did not accept his correct suggestions, he was patient and did political and ideological work with them, studying Chairman Mao's works together, and seeking unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Yingjun was both rich in revolutionary spirit and had strong organizational discipline. He considered the overall situation and always put revolutionary interests first. He was not afraid of setbacks and humiliation. In his diary, he encouraged himself: "When receiving criticism from leaders and the masses, especially when some criticism is not entirely appropriate, how not to be crushed by such criticism and lose heart, how to stand tall and bravely move forward, don't you think this is a greater test!" He endured all kinds of tests and always moved forward bravely.

Liu Yingjun's mind had only one "public" character. The "public" we speak of is the public of the people, the proletariat, socialism, and communism. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the greatest interests of the proletariat and the broadest masses of the people. It is our fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, build socialism, and march towards communism. Loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to serve the public, to serve the people wholeheartedly. Liu Yingjun deeply understood this, and he was unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	(II)

Chairman Mao said: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn it."

Liu Yingjun remembered Chairman Mao's teachings. From a peasant's son, he quickly grew into a great communist warrior. The fundamental reason was that he took Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all actions and threw himself into the fiery class struggle, learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

In the summer of 1962, when the Kuomintang bandits, incited by American imperialism, were madly clamoring to invade the mainland, Liu Yingjun, filled with hatred for the class enemy, bravely enlisted in the army.

Comrade Lin Biao, with the greatest political foresight, personally initiated and led the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army. When Liu Yingjun enlisted, it was the third year of this movement's deep development. As soon as he arrived at the unit, the first slogan he saw was "Definitely learn Mao Zedong Thought thoroughly," and the first report he heard was an introduction to the experience of "studying with questions, applying actively, learning and using together, learning urgently when needed, and seeing immediate results." On the first page of his diary, he wrote the first oath: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." Comrade Lin Biao's series of instructions on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works greatly broadened Liu Yingjun's political horizon. He determined a path: "To make a revolution, one must read Chairman Mao's books!"

Liu Yingjun had a deep understanding of the importance of ideological remolding. He wrote in his notes: "Today's class struggle at home and abroad is extremely sharp and complex. Imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are competing for the younger generation, using various forms of bourgeois ideology to corrupt the youth, like sugar-coated bullets, attempting to place their hopes for counter-revolutionary restoration on the degeneration of the younger generation. And individualism is precisely the gap they want to exploit. If one does not pay attention to thorough remolding and cleansing, then under certain conditions, one's thoughts will inevitably become rotten and moldy, and eventually become a captive of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, I deeply feel that studying Chairman Mao's works must thoroughly remold one's worldview." He recognized the urgent significance of learning and ideological remolding from the needs of class struggle and revolution.

For this reason, Liu Yingjun did not study in isolation from real struggles but actively participated in various struggles and learned in the struggle. He said: "To make a revolution, one must struggle. Fear of struggle will inevitably make one not dare to make a revolution. For us proletarian revolutionaries, we dedicate everything to the communist revolutionary cause. Apart from participating in revolutionary struggles, what greater happiness is there?" He dared to struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies, dared to struggle against bourgeois and revisionist fallacies, and dared to struggle against erroneous tendencies that do not emphasize politics. It was in this way that he learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought in revolutionary struggles and in getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, remolding his subjective world while remolding the objective world.

Liu Yingjun had a high standard in ideological remolding, which was to respond to Chairman Mao's call and strive to be like Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, Lei Feng, and other true communists. The number of times he studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Opposing Liberalism" was, as he wrote in his diary, "countless." After studying Lei Feng's deeds over and over again, he said: "What Lei Feng can do, 'I can do it, a hundred can do it!' Every time he read Chairman Mao's works, he would ask himself four questions: How did Chairman Mao say it? How do I think? How do I act? How should I act in the future? He wanted to keep up with Chairman Mao and let Mao Zedong Thought guide all his actions.

Liu Yingjun's thought revolutionization was the result of his conscious, diligent, and arduous study and application of Chairman Mao's works in struggles.

	(III)

Chairman Mao said: "The Communist Party within the Fourth Red Army exists with various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line. If not thoroughly corrected, the great revolutionary struggle entrusted to the Fourth Red Army by China will inevitably not be able to be undertaken."

Liu Yingjun remembered Chairman Mao's teachings. He dared to struggle against the enemy, against various erroneous thoughts and behaviors, and also dared to struggle against the "self" in his head. He understood that without destruction, there can be no construction. To truly be loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one must overcome the various non-proletarian influences in one's mind and completely liberate oneself from the "self."

After enlisting, he once had burdens in his mind due to family practical problems. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, he correctly understood the relationship between the individual and the collective. He said: "No matter how big personal matters are, they are small matters; no matter how small collective matters are, they are big matters." After ideological struggle, he made a vow: "To the revolution, one must not be half-hearted!" He once considered his personal future while performing his duties as a driver. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, deeply touching his soul, and dispelled his worries about his personal future. He said: "True communists are those who have broken free from the shackles of the small 'self.' Their minds only have the interests of the revolution and the collective. As long as it is beneficial to the revolution and the collective, they actively do it, without considering fame and position, and without worrying about what others will say about them."

Chairman Mao said: "Use the weapon of self-criticism and the method of strengthening learning to remold oneself, making oneself suitable for the needs of the Party and the revolution." Liu Yingjun truly understood Chairman Mao's teachings. He used the sharpest weapon of criticism and self-criticism to sweep away all non-proletarian dust in his mind, continuously promoting thought revolutionization.

He dared to expose his shortcomings and mistakes and always checked and corrected his shortcomings and mistakes with the most serious attitude and the fastest speed, striving every day on the road of thought revolutionization. Everyone knows that he did many good deeds beneficial to the people in his life, but what he recorded in his diary were one shortcoming after another. He criticized his shortcomings every day, and in class meetings and five-good evaluations, he always specifically pointed out his shortcomings. Even in his last moments, he still had a draft of an "annual self-summary outline" in his chest pocket, filled with the spirit of self-criticism.

He could most enthusiastically and sincerely accept comrades' criticisms, regarding this as the greatest care and concern for himself. He accepted criticisms without any conditions, without calculating any methods, and never shifted responsibility for his shortcomings and mistakes, never defended himself. He truly did as Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, as long as you are right, we will correct them."

Liu Yingjun proved with his actions that he was a person who had broken free from the shackles of the small "self." In his ordinary position, he worked selflessly, never complained, and never tired. He was happy to be an ordinary soldier and never cared about personal fame and status. He did many good deeds for the company and the people, never left his name, never reported, never recorded in his diary, and even when misunderstood, he did not explain himself. He regarded all this as his duty, his revolutionary responsibility, and something that should be done. In times of danger, he stood up and saved others, showing the highest degree of self-sacrifice.

Liu Yingjun armed himself with the great Mao Zedong Thought and had a selfless heart. Therefore, in major struggles between right and wrong, he could be "daring" at the forefront, with a firm stance and clear banner, both fighting head-on against erroneous behaviors that went against Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and uniting and working with comrades who had made mistakes but were willing to correct them.

Only by daring to break with the "self" like Liu Yingjun and establishing a proletarian worldview of serving the public, can one correctly understand and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and become a conscious defender of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Lin Biao repeatedly instructed us to cultivate people with communist spirit. What kind of people have communist spirit? They are the kind of people advocated by our great leader Chairman Mao, such as Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, Liu Huilan, Lei Feng, and those like Ouyang Hai, Jiao Yulu, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang. Our new society needs such people to create. Only with a large number of new people with communist spirit can we successfully carry out socialist revolution and construction and gradually reach communism.

In the proletarian cultural revolution and in the current struggle of our army to support the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power, every cadre and soldier must learn better from Liu Yingjun. Like him, be unlimitedly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Like him, use Mao Zedong Thought to remold one's soul, break with the "self" and establish the "public," strengthen thought revolutionization, and become a communist warrior who serves the public wholeheartedly and for life.

    无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    ——谈刘英俊的思想革命化
    中国人民解放军沈阳部队某部政治部
    一九六六年三月十五日，毛主席的好战士刘英俊同志，为保卫人民群众的安全，献出了年轻的生命。一年过去了。刘英俊努力学习毛泽东思想，忠实贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的光辉形象，始终活在人们心里，在伟大的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，成为鼓舞革命人民前进的力量。
    毛主席早在三十年前就提出：“要造就一大批人，这些人是革命的先锋队。这些人具有政治的远见。这些人充满着斗争精神与牺牲精神。这些人是胸怀坦白的，忠诚的，积极的，与正直的。这些人不谋私利，唯一的为着民族与社会的解放。这些人不怕困难，在困难面前总是坚定的，勇敢向前的。这些人不是狂妄分子，也不是风头主义者，而是脚踏实地富于实际精神的人们。中国要有一大群这样的先锋分子，中国革命的任务就能够顺利的解决。”
    刘英俊以他革命的、战斗的一生，表明了他同张思德、刘胡兰、雷锋等一样，正是我们伟大领袖所期望、所造就的这种人。他为我们树立了思想革命化的好榜样。
    刘英俊的思想革命化，集中表现在他无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命已经进入一个新阶段，进入了两个阶级、两条路线决战的关键时刻。在这个时候，我们学习刘英俊这一最宝贵的品质，有着更重要、更现实的意义。
                         （一）
    毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，第一条是：“他们必须是真正的马克思列宁主义者，而不是象赫鲁晓夫那样的挂着马克思列宁主义招牌的修正主义者。”
    林彪同志根据毛主席的指示，结合我军实际情况，提出了培养和选拔干部的三条标准。第一条是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，对我们无产阶级革命者来说，是根本方向问题，根本立场问题，是革命的大节。刘英俊正是在这个大节问题上，表现得十分突出。
    刘英俊无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席。他每时每刻都想望着毛主席。
    刘英俊无比信仰战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他说：“毛主席著作象太阳，字字句句闪金光，照得战士心里亮，工作学习有方向。”“千条江河向东流，万颗银星朝北斗，毛泽东思想照全球！”他坚信全世界革命人民一定会在伟大毛泽东思想的旗帜下团结起来，走向胜利，正象滚滚江河流入东海一样，这是历史发展的必然趋势，什么力量也阻挡不住。
    刘英俊对毛主席、对毛泽东思想，有着极其真挚、极其深厚的阶级感情。他告诫自己：“忘掉了毛主席的话，就等于忘掉了过去的苦处和你的责任。”在他看来，过去的一千个苦处，一万个苦处，没有毛泽东思想是最大的苦处；今天的一千个甜，一万个甜，有了毛泽东思想是最大的甜；革命战士有一千个责任，一万个责任，照毛主席的指示办事是最根本的责任。
    尤其可贵的是，刘英俊在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中，能够勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，表现出对无产阶级革命事业的无限忠诚。
    当社会上的牛鬼蛇神，为反革命复辟制造舆论，放出攻击毛泽东思想的一支支毒箭的时候，刘英俊满腔怒火，坚决反击，和阶级敌人势不两立。
    当隐藏在党内的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，千方百计抵制毛泽东思想，限制毛泽东思想传播的时候，刘英俊以战斗姿态，针锋相对地热情宣传毛泽东思想，宣传林彪同志关于活学活用毛主席著作的指示，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    当部队的革命化建设一度受到资产阶级军事路线冲击的时候，刘英俊勇敢地站出来，进行了不妥协的斗争，坚决抵制和反对资产阶级军事路线，坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的建军路线。
    刘英俊遵循毛主席的教导，对敌狠，对己和。他按照毛主席关于分清两类矛盾的指示，对于人民内部问题，既能坚持原则，又善于团结同志。当一些同志对他所进行的斗争一时还不理解，劝他不要坚持这样做的时候，他觉得，这是方向问题，一定要斗争下去。当有人把责难他的话说过了头的时候，他冷静地作了分析，认为是认识上的问题而加以谅解，不把矛盾扩大化。当别人不接受他的正确建议的时候，他不急躁，耐心地做政治思想工作，同他们一起学习毛主席著作，求得在毛泽东思想的基础上统一起来。
    刘英俊既富于革命精神，又有很强的组织纪律性。他顾全大局，处处以革命利益为重。他不怕挫折和委屈。他在日记中勉励自己：“在受到领导和群众的批评，特别是有些批评并不十分恰当的时候，如何不为这种批评压得垂头丧气，如何挺直腰杆勇敢地往前走，你不觉得这是一种更大的考验吗！”他经住了各种考验，总是勇往直前。
    刘英俊的头脑里只有一个“公”字。我们所说的公，是人民的公，无产阶级的公，社会主义、共产主义的公。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，代表着无产阶级和最广大人民的最大利益，是我们防止修正主义、防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义和走向共产主义的根本保证。忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是为大公，就是全心全意为人民服务。刘英俊深深懂得这一点，他无限地忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
                           （二）
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”
    刘英俊牢记毛主席的教导。他从一个贫农的儿子，迅速成长为伟大的共产主义战士，最根本的原因，就是他把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示，投身到火热的阶级斗争中去，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。
    一九六二年夏天，正当蒋匪帮在美帝国主义唆使下疯狂叫嚣窜犯大陆的时候，刘英俊满怀着对阶级敌人的仇恨，毅然报名参军。
    林彪同志以最大的政治远见，亲自发起和领导着我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。刘英俊入伍时，正是这个运动深入发展的第三个年头。他一到部队，看到的第一条标语是“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”，听到的第一个报告是学习毛主席著作“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的经验介绍。他在日记本扉页上写下的第一句誓言是“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”林彪同志关于活学活用毛主席著作的一系列指示，大大开阔了刘英俊的政治眼界。他认定了一条路：“干革命就要读毛主席的书！”
    刘英俊对思想改造的重要性有着深刻的理解。他在心得笔记里写道：“今天国内外的阶级斗争，是极为尖锐复杂的，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派都在争夺青年一代，他们用形形色色的资产阶级思想来腐蚀青年，就象糖衣炮弹一样，企图把反革命复辟的希望寄托在年青一代的变质上。而个人主义思想正是他们所要利用的一个缺口，如果不注意彻底的改造和清洗，那么在一定的条件下，自己的思想必然会发臭、发霉，以至堕落成为资产阶级的俘虏。因此，我深深的体会到，学习毛主席著作，必须彻底地改造自己的世界观。”他是从阶级斗争的需要、革命的需要出发，来认识学习和思想改造的迫切意义的。
    正因为这样，刘英俊不是脱离现实斗争，闭门读书，而是积极地参加各种斗争，在斗争中学习。他说：
  “要革命就要斗争，害怕斗争就必然不敢革命。对于我们无产阶级革命者来说，我们的一切都献给了共产主义的革命事业，除了参加革命斗争以外，还有什么比这更大的幸福呢？”他敢于同国内外的阶级敌人斗，敢于同资产阶级、修正主义的谬论斗，敢于同不突出政治的错误倾向斗。他就是这样，在革命斗争的实践中，在接近工农群众中，学习和运用毛泽东思想，在改造客观世界的过程中改造自己的主观世界。
    刘英俊在思想改造中有一个高标准，这就是响应毛主席的号召，立志做张思德、白求恩、雷锋那样的真正的共产主义者。他学习“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》的次数，就象他在日记中写的那样：“数也数不清”。他一遍又一遍地学习了雷锋的事迹后说：雷锋能做到的，“我也能，一百个能！”他每读一次毛主席著作，都要向自己提出这样四个问题：毛主席是怎样讲的？我是怎样想的？我是怎样做的？今后应当怎样去做？他要使自己紧紧地跟上毛主席，让毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动。
    刘英俊的思想革命化，是他在斗争中自觉地、勤奋地、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
                          （三）
    毛主席说：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”
    刘英俊牢记毛主席的教导。他敢于同敌人斗，同各种错误思想行为斗，也敢于同自己头脑里的“私”字斗。他懂得，不破不立，要真正做到忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，必须克服头脑里的各种非无产阶级思想影响，从“私”字中彻底解放出来。
    他入伍后，一度因为家庭实际问题，思想上有过负担。他通过学习毛主席著作，正确认识了个人和集体的关系。他说：“个人的事情再大，也是小事；集体的事情再小，也是大事。”经过思想斗争，他发下了誓言：“对革命绝不能三心二意！”
    他担任驭手工作，有一段时间对所谓个人前途也有所考虑。他反复学习毛主席著作，深深触动自己的灵魂，打消了对个人前途的患得患失。他说：“真正的共产主义者是摆脱了小‘我’的束缚的人，他们的心目之中只有革命的利益，集体的利益，只要是对革命对集体有利的事，他们就积极的干，从不计较名誉和地位，也毫不考虑别人会怎样议论自己。”
    毛主席说：“要用自我批评的武器和加强学习的方法，来改造自己，使适合于党与革命的需要。”刘英俊真正领会了毛主席的教导，他正是运用批评与自我批评这个最锐利的武器，扫除自己头脑里一切非无产阶级的思想尘埃，不断推进思想革命化的。
    他敢于暴露自己的缺点错误，而且总是以最认真的态度和最快的速度检查和改正自己的缺点错误，在思想革命化的道路上“只争朝夕”。大家都知道，他一生做过许许多多有益于人民的好事，然而在他日记里所记载的，却是一个又一个的缺点。他天天批评自己的缺点，在班务会上，在五好评比会上，总是具体地揭自己的短处。就在他生命的最后一刻，他胸前口袋里还装着一份没有写完的“年终自我总结提纲”，通篇充满着自我批评的精神。
    他能够最热情、最诚恳地接受同志们的批评；把这看作是对自己的最大爱护和关怀。他接受批评从来不讲任何条件，不计较任何方式，对自己的缺点错误从来不推脱责任，不替自己申辩。他确确实实做到了毛主席所说的：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”
    刘英俊用行动证明了他是摆脱小“我”束缚的人。他在平凡的工作岗位上忘我奋斗，从来不叫苦，不叫累。他乐于当好普通一兵，从不计较个人的名利地位。他为连队、为人民群众做了大量好事，从来不留名，不汇报，不在日记里记载，甚至遭到误解时也没有为自己作解释。他把这一切看作是本份，是应尽的革命职责，是理所当然的。他在危急关头挺身而出，舍己救人，表现了最高度的自我牺牲精神。
    刘英俊用伟大的毛泽东思想武装了自己，有无私的胸怀。因而在大是大非斗争中就能够“敢”字当头，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，既能同违背毛泽东思想、违背毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的错误行为作针锋相对的斗争，又能同犯了错误、愿意改正错误的同志团结共事。
    破私才能立公。只有象刘英俊那样敢于和“私”字决裂，树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观，才能正确地理解和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能做一个自觉的捍卫毛泽东思想、捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的勇敢战斗员。
    林彪同志一再指示我们，要塑造共产主义精神的人。什么样是共产主义精神的人？就是我们伟大的领袖毛主席所提倡的张思德、白求恩、刘胡兰、雷锋那样的人，就是象欧阳海、焦裕禄、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥那样的人。我们新的社会需要这种人来创造。有了大量的共产主义新人，才能胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，才能逐步地到达共产主义。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，在当前我军支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，我们每一个干部战士，都要更好地向刘英俊学习。象他那样，无限忠于伟大的领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。象他那样，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，破私立公，加强思想革命化，做一个一心为公、一生为公的共产主义战士。
