The People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers, who are fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses, warmly welcome the publication of the editorial "On the Revolutionary 'Three-in-One Combination'" in the fifth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine, which is shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers and officers excitedly say: Chairman Mao's directive on implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy and establishing a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ—the revolutionary committee—is like a beacon, illuminating the path for the proletarian revolutionary masses to victory in their struggle for power. They declare that they will resolutely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, unite with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary leading cadres, most resolutely implement and defend the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, and make new and greater contributions in the struggle for power through the "three-in-one combination."

On the evening when the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcasted the editorial from the "Red Flag" magazine, many soldiers and officers lined up in front of loudspeakers and gathered around radios, listening with great excitement to the broadcast. As soon as the broadcast ended, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers waved red flags and the shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!" "The revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' policy is excellent!" Many units' soldiers and officers immediately held rallies or discussion meetings after listening to the broadcast. The soldiers and officers read Chairman Mao's latest directive over and over again: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' policy must be implemented, and a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ must be established. The name of this power organ is best called the revolutionary committee." The troops in Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and many units in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet Military Regions, based on the radio broadcast, recorded Chairman Mao's latest directive and printed it into leaflets. They organized propaganda teams and dispatched propaganda vehicles to factories, rural areas, schools, and streets to propagate, quickly spreading Chairman Mao's latest directive to the broad revolutionary masses.

The soldiers and officers of the PLA's army, navy, and air force in Fuzhou, who have created immortal merits in the struggle to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, expressed with great excitement that the editorial of the "Red Flag" magazine has brought us the latest directive from our supreme commander Chairman Mao. We firmly support it and will definitely carry it out. The soldiers and officers of the "Dajian Island Battle Model Company," who have won honors in the march into Fujian and recently created new merits in smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, gathered in front of the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao on the night of the 9th, listening to the important editorial broadcast as if receiving a battle order. They unanimously pointed out: Chairman Mao's directive to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy is the strong political and organizational guarantee for the proletarian revolutionary masses to achieve victory in their struggle for power, and it is the beacon guiding the continued victory of the Cultural Revolution! We are the People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao, and we will always stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, most resolutely support the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and make greater contributions to achieving new victories in the Cultural Revolution. The soldiers and officers of a certain air force unit, on a water conservancy construction site, studied and discussed this editorial with poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres. Air Force First-Class Hero Lu Min said, the editorial embodies the great Mao Zedong Thought. The history of the Chinese revolution has proven that every time the revolution reaches a critical moment, it is our great commander Chairman Mao who leads the revolution from victory to victory. Today, at the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, Chairman Mao, based on the experience of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the struggle, timely proposed the policy of implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We are the people's army created by Chairman Mao, and in implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, closely rely on the broad revolutionary masses, humbly learn from the broad revolutionary masses, conduct thorough investigations and research, and strongly support and actively participate in the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle for power.

The soldiers and officers of a certain naval ship, who have consecutively won the "Four Good" title for six years, said at a discussion meeting that the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is like three pillars supporting the sky, standing firmly, and indispensable. The revolutionary masses are the foundation of the temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the revolutionary leading cadres are the backbone of this power organ, and the PLA is the strong pillar and defender of this power organ. All class enemies will be smashed to pieces in front of the temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." At this critical moment of the Cultural Revolution when the struggle for power is intensifying, our great leader Chairman Mao proposed the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," which is an unprecedented great innovation. The broad masses of soldiers and officers in various units emphasized when welcoming the publication of the fifth issue of the "Red Flag" editorial that in implementing the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," whoever denies that the broad revolutionary masses are the foundation of the temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is denying Chairman Mao's mass line; whoever denies the core and backbone role of revolutionary cadres is denying Chairman Mao's cadre policy; and whoever denies the participation and support of the PLA is denying the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The soldiers and officers in Nanjing, Wuhan, Kunming, Lanzhou, Chengdu, and many other units said in their discussions that the fifth issue of the "Red Flag" editorial highly evaluates the role of the PLA in the temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." This is the greatest trust, care, and encouragement from our great leader Chairman Mao to our army. The PLA is the revolutionary army created by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has entrusted us with such a heavy responsibility. We will have a red heart and resolutely shoulder this heavy burden with our iron shoulders. We will always stand with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, sharing the same breath, the same destiny, and being closely connected. The guns in our hands will resolutely serve the proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The soldiers and officers said, we, the PLA, are the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the loyal defender of the Cultural Revolution. We will always maintain a high level of revolutionary vigilance, use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, resolutely support the genuine proletarian revolutionary masses, unite with genuine friends, and firmly strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and snakes. We will never allow the class enemies to play tricks, using the pretext of the "three-in-one combination" to engage in centrism, conciliationism, and the policy of merging two into one. We will never allow the class enemies to seize the fruits of the Cultural Revolution and carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration.

    最坚决实行和捍卫革命的“三结合”方针
    紧紧遵循伟大统帅毛主席的教导，坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，在“三结合”联合夺权斗争中作出新的更大贡献。
    据新华社十一日讯　紧紧和无产阶级革命派战斗在一起的人民解放军陆海空三军指战员，最热烈地欢呼闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期社论《论革命的“三结合”》的发表。指战员们激动地说：毛主席关于实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——革命委员会的最新指示，象光芒万丈的明灯，照亮了无产阶级革命派胜利进行夺权斗争的道路。他们表示，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的号召，和广大革命群众、革命领导干部团结在一起，最坚决地实行革命的“三结合”的方针，最坚定地捍卫革命的“三结合”的方针，在“三结合”联合夺权斗争中作出新的更大贡献。
    中央人民广播电台播送《红旗》杂志社论的当晚，许多部队指战员列队在大喇叭前，围坐在收音机旁，以无比激动的心情，收听广播。广播一结束，广大干部战士挥舞着红旗和红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，纵情高呼“毛主席万岁！”“光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！”“革命的‘三结合’方针好得很！”许多部队的指战员听完广播，当即举行誓师大会或座谈会。指战员们一遍又一遍地集体朗读毛主席的最新指示：在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。北京、沈阳、济南、福州、广州等部队以及新疆、内蒙古、西藏军区许多部队，根据电台广播，把毛主席的最新指示录了音，还印成传单，组织宣传队，出动宣传车，到工厂、农村、学校、街头宣传，把毛主席的最新指示迅速传给广大革命群众。
    在彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争中创立了不朽功勋的福州部队陆海空三军指战员，怀着无比激动的心情表示，《红旗》杂志社论传来了我们的最高统帅毛主席的最新指示。我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。当年进军福建荣立战功、最近在粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑中再次创立新功的某部“大嶝岛战斗模范连”指战员，九日晚上集合在伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像前，象接受战斗命令一样收听了这篇重要社论的广播。他们一致指出：毛主席提出的实行革命的“三结合”的方针，是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争取得胜利的强大政治保证和组织保证，是指引无产阶级文化大革命继续胜利前进的灯塔！我们是毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军，我们永远坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，最坚决地支持革命的“三结合”，为夺取文化大革命的新胜利作出更大贡献。空军某部指战员，在水利工地上，同贫下中农和农村干部一起学习座谈这篇社论。空军一级战斗英雄鲁珉说，社论体现了伟大的毛泽东思想。中国革命历史证明，每当革命的关键时刻，总是我们伟大的统帅毛主席，引导着革命从胜利走向胜利。今天，正当无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行夺权斗争的关键时刻，毛主席又根据无产阶级革命派在斗争实践中的经验，及时提出了实行革命的“三结合”的方针。我们是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，在实行革命的“三结合”的方针中，一定遵循毛主席的教导，紧紧依靠广大革命群众，虚心向广大革命群众学习，深入调查研究，大力支援并积极参加无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。
    连续六年荣获四好称号的海军某舰指战员在座谈会上说，革命的“三结合”好象三根擎天柱，顶天立地，缺一不可。革命群众是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础，革命领导干部是这个权力机构的骨干，解放军是这个权力机构的强大支柱，又是
  “三结合”的捍卫者。一切阶级敌人都将在革命的“三结合”临时权力机构面前碰得头破血流。在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出革命的“三结合”的方针，这是史无前例的伟大创举。各部队广大指战员在欢呼《红旗》第五期社论发表时，强调指出，在实行革命的“三结合”的方针中，谁否认广大革命群众是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础，谁就是否定毛主席的群众路线，谁否认革命干部的核心作用和骨干作用，谁就是否定毛主席的干部政策；谁否认人民解放军的参加和支援，谁就是否认无产阶级专政。
    南京、武汉、昆明、兰州、成都等许多部队指战员在座谈讨论时说，《红旗》第五期社论，高度评价了人民解放军在革命的“三结合”临时权力机构中的作用，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我军的最大信任、最大关怀、最大鼓舞。人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的革命军队，毛主席把这样重的担子交给我们，我们胸怀一颗红心，坚决用铁肩膀挑起这副重担。我们牢记毛主席的教导：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务”。我们永远和广大革命群众、革命干部心连心，同呼吸、共命运，血肉相连。我们手里的枪杆子，坚决为无产阶级革命派服务，为革命的“三结合”服务。指战员们说，我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者。我们时刻保持高度的革命警惕，以毛泽东思想为指针，分清敌我，坚决支持真正的无产阶级革命派，团结真正的朋友，坚决打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神，绝不允许阶级敌人玩弄阴谋，借口“三结合”，搞折中主义、调和主义、合二而一，绝不允许阶级敌人篡夺无产阶级文化大革命的果实和实行反革命复辟。
