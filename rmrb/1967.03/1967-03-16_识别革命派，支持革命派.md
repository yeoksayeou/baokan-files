On January 22, as we were studying Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the revolutionary leftist masses, 23 revolutionary organizations in Qingdao achieved unity and established the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee (originally named the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Committee), seizing power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee.

The revolutionary situation required us to quickly express our stance. We believed that, under these circumstances, we must identify the leftists from a macro perspective, thereby determining our actions.

Firstly, we analyzed whether this power should be seized. The materials exposed during the previous stage of the Cultural Revolution revealed that there was indeed a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee. During the Cultural Revolution, they stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, fearing the masses and the revolution, and directing the struggle against the revolutionary masses. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and firmly plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts in Qingdao, it was necessary to seize power from the hands of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Therefore, this power seizure was correct and should be carried out.

Next, we comprehensively and historically analyzed whether the mass organizations participating in the seizure of power were revolutionary leftists.

The main mass organizations participating in this seizure of power were the Qingdao City and County Red Guard Liaison Headquarters, the Dongfanghong Commune of Qingdao Medical College, the Light Industry Division, etc. They had consistently directed their struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party since the Cultural Revolution. They dared to think and act boldly, although they had various shortcomings, but their overall direction was correct. Therefore, they were revolutionary leftists. Their rise to seize power should be firmly supported.

Just as we were preparing to publicly support the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee, a new situation suddenly arose. On the morning of the 23rd, major streets throughout the city were filled with big-character posters opposing the seizure of power, and defaming the revolutionary leading cadres who participated in the seizure of power. Suddenly, the city was in turmoil, and debates raged. Since the overall direction of this seizure of power was correct, why was there such strong opposition? Had our judgment been wrong?

Chairman Mao said: "The correct deployment of a commander comes from a correct decision, a correct decision comes from a correct judgment, a correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance, and from the interconnected thinking of various reconnaissance materials." We followed Chairman Mao's instructions and immediately sent people to investigate and study the actual struggle, so as to determine our actions.

Through the investigation, we discovered that among the opposition forces, there were some reactionary organizations, such as the "Red Flag Army" and the "Red Power Protection Army," etc. Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They opposed it, which precisely shows that this seizure of power is correct, it is the revolutionary faction seizing power, and we must firmly support it.

Among the opposition forces, there were also a few originally leftist organizations that criticized the secrecy and suddenness of this seizure of power, excluding other organizations. These issues confused some of the masses. How should we view these issues? "These comrades' way of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and mainstream aspects of the problem, but emphasize those non-essential and non-mainstream aspects. It should be pointed out: one should not overlook non-essential and non-mainstream aspects of the problem, but one should not regard these as the essence and mainstream, so as to confuse one's direction." Using Chairman Mao's instructions to analyze, we realized that these were non-essential and non-mainstream issues. "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another class." The seizure of power is a revolutionary action by the proletariat to overthrow the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Given the situation in Qingdao at that time, it was understandable not to publicize the seizure of power plan in advance to prevent the enemy from being prepared. At the same time, through the investigation, we learned that the reason why this seizure of power did not unite with a certain organization was because there were principled disagreements with them on major issues.

After we analyzed these situations, we became even more determined to support the 23 revolutionary organizations in seizing power, and we further realized: the seizure of power struggle is a very sharp and complex class struggle, we must use the method of class analysis, firmly grasp the overall direction of the movement, and not be confused by some surface phenomena and minor issues, failing to identify the revolutionary leftists, and taking a wait-and-see attitude.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." In the Cultural Revolution, loving the revolutionary leftists, firmly standing on the side of the revolutionary leftists, and wholeheartedly supporting them, this is our overall direction, it must not be doubted, it must not be shaken.

On January 24, the revolutionary masses of the Qingdao Daily did not yield to the threats of the opposition forces and published the documents of the Revolutionary Committee. At this time, the focus of the struggle shifted to the newspaper office, and the opposition forces threatened to smash the newspaper office. We believed that the newspaper office was the mouthpiece of the Revolutionary Committee and could not be destroyed. Therefore, we immediately dispatched troops to protect the newspaper office. Following this, we supported the revolutionary masses of the newly seized Qingdao Municipal People's Broadcasting Station and broadcasted the documents of the Revolutionary Committee, quickly spreading the good news of the seizure of power throughout the city, province, and country. We also patiently persuaded and educated the deceived masses, helping them recognize and correct their mistakes, and gradually aligning with the leftists. This action greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction, won over the deceived masses, and effectively isolated and struck at the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, bringing about a new situation in the Qingdao revolution.

    识别革命派，支持革命派
    中国人民解放军驻青岛某部党委会
    一月二十二日，正当我们学习毛主席关于人民解放军要积极支持革命左派广大群众的指示的时候，青岛市的二十三个革命组织，实现大联合，成立了青岛市革命委员会（原名青岛市革命造反委员会），夺了前青岛市委和市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大权。
    革命形势要求我们迅速地表示态度。我们认为，在这种情况下，必须从大方向上去识别左派，从而决定我们的行动。
    首先，我们分析了这个权应不应该夺。前一阶段文化大革命运动中揭发出来的材料，说明青岛市委内确实有一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在文化大革命中，他们又顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，害怕群众，害怕革命，把斗争矛头指向革命群众。为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗牢固地插在青岛市的一切阵地上，就必须从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里把大权夺过来。因此，这个权夺得对，应该夺。
    其次，我们又全面地历史地分析了参加夺权的群众组织是否是革命左派。
    参加这次夺权的主要群众组织，是青岛市大中学红卫兵联络总部、青岛医学院东方红公社、轻工分部等组织，他们从文化大革命以来，始终把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们敢想敢干，虽然有过这样或那样的缺点，但大方向一直是正确的。因此，他们是革命左派。他们起来夺权，我们应该坚决支持。
    正当我们准备公开支持青岛市革命委员会的时候，突然出现了新的情况。二十三日清晨，全市各主要街道写满了反对夺权的大字标语，并诬蔑参加夺权的革命领导干部。顿时满城风雨，争论不休。既然这次夺权的大方向是正确的，为什么会遭到如此强烈的反对呢？难道我们的判断错了吗？
    毛主席说：“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。”我们遵循毛主席的这个教导，随即派人到实际斗争中去调查研究，以便决定我们的行动。
    经过调查，我们发现反对派中有一部分是反动组织，如“红旗军”、“红色政权保卫军”等。毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他们反对，正说明这次夺权是正确的，是革命派夺权，我们就要坚决支持。
    在反对派中还有个别原来是左派的组织，他们指责这次夺权搞得秘密突然，把其他一些组织排斥在外。这些问题，使一些群众受到迷惑。究竟怎样认识这些问题呢？“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。应当指出：不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，……但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”用毛主席的教导一分析，就使我们认识到这些问题是非本质非主流方面的问题。“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”夺权斗争就是无产阶级推翻党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命行动，根据当时青岛市的情况，事先不把夺权计划公布于众，免使敌人预有准备，是可以理解的。同时，经过调查，我们了解到这次夺权所以没有联合某一个组织，是因为同他们在重大问题上有原则分歧。
    当我们分析了这些情况以后，就更加坚定了我们支持二十三个革命组织联合夺权的决心，并使我们进一步认识到：夺权斗争是一场十分尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，一定要运用阶级分析方法，紧紧掌握运动的大方向，而不能被一些表面现象和枝节问题所迷惑，识别不出革命左派，采取观潮态度。
    毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”在文化大革命中，热爱革命左派，坚决站在革命左派一边，全心全意地支持他们，这是我们的大方向，绝不能怀疑，绝不能动摇。
    一月二十四日，青岛日报社的革命群众不顾反对派的威胁，刊登了革命委员会的文件。这时，斗争焦点移到报社，反对派扬言要砸烂报社。我们认为，报社是革命委员会的喉舌，不能破坏。因此，我们立即派部队保卫报社。接着我们又支持刚刚夺权的青岛市人民广播电台革命群众的要求，广播了革命委员会的文件，使青岛市夺权的好消息，迅速传遍全市、全省、全国。我们并且对受蒙蔽的群众进行了耐心的说服教育，使他们认识了错误，改正了错误，纷纷向左派靠拢，这样做，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，争取了受蒙蔽的群众，有力地孤立和打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，使青岛市的革命形势出现了新的局面。
