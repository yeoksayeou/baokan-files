Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the great storm of the "January Revolution" is sweeping across the entire country with tremendous momentum and extraordinary speed. The proletarian revolutionary masses in our city, following Chairman Mao's correct policy of the "three-in-one combination," are uniting with a broad range of revolutionary cadres to struggle for power against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

In the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses, there are thousands of things to do, but the most fundamental thing is to study Chairman Mao's works well and, according to Mao Zedong Thought, solve the various complex problems encountered in the struggle for power.

For this reason, the Revolutionary Committee of Taiyuan City has decided: All proletarian revolutionary fighters and the broad revolutionary masses must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. At present, the focus should be on studying well the "Three Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Against Libertinism," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," as well as the editorial and commentary in the third issue of *Red Flag*, and the editorials in *People's Daily*, etc.

In the process of study, special attention should be paid to the following points:

(1) The proletarian revolutionary masses uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a battle cry issued by our great leader Chairman Mao and a strategic task for the new stage of the proletarian cultural revolution. We must firmly grasp this major direction, concentrate our forces, and launch the struggle for power from the bottom up. We must fully recognize that all reactionaries will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will certainly not resign themselves to their failure and will inevitably fight to the death with us. Our struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a great showdown between two classes. All revolutionary comrades must consider and handle all problems from this major direction and must subordinate themselves to this major direction. In the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses, we must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's statements on the struggle for power, study the "Sixteen Points," firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, concentrate our targets, and strike hard at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Otherwise, we will commit directional errors.

(2) Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for revolution." In the current great struggle to implement the "three-in-one combination" and seize power, it is particularly necessary to seriously study this instruction from Chairman Mao. Only by unwaveringly implementing the "three-in-one combination" can we form a true great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses and ensure the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road achieves thorough victory. The practice of believing that all power-holders are generally untrustworthy, completely denying them, and overthrowing them all, or only regarding cadres as "informed persons," only allowing them to expose problems, and not allowing them to stand up and revolutionize, is contrary to Mao Zedong Thought and is welcomed by the class enemies. Therefore, we must use Chairman Mao's class analysis method to view our cadre ranks. Those who are the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road must be resolutely overthrown and never allowed to rise again; those who are proletarian power-holders must be resolutely supported, trusted, and united with to struggle for power; those who are general cadres who have made mistakes in their lines must be strictly dealt with according to Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy of punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient, and the formula of unity-criticism-unity, helping them correct their mistakes, and quickly returning them to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, standing with them, and fighting shoulder to shoulder to achieve greater victories.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the heroic army personally founded by Chairman Mao and a model for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." At this critical moment in the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has taken a firm stand, held high the banner, and resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionary masses without any ambiguity, making a great contribution to the proletarian cultural revolution. The proletarian revolutionary masses are all jubilant about this. However, those class enemies who are unwilling to perish have launched a counterrevolutionary current, directing their struggle against the great People's Liberation Army, attempting to sabotage the powerful tool of proletarian dictatorship and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. This is the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line in the new situation. We must fully expose the enemy's new plot and resolutely repel the arrogant counterattack of this reactionary force.

Implementing or not implementing the "three-in-one combination" to seize power is an important sign of whether to carry out the struggle for power along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao or to deviate from the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. It is the dividing line between true seizure of power and false seizure of power. The proletarian revolutionary masses must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, deeply understand this great thought of Chairman Mao, seriously implement it, and resolutely defend the revolutionary policy of the "three-in-one combination."

(3) In the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses and after achieving initial victory in the struggle for power, some revolutionary mass organizations have developed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts. For example, sectarianism, cliquism, dispersalism, unorganized views, ultra-democracy, anarchism, libertinism, subjectivism, individualism, and other erroneous tendencies, all boil down to the "private" character playing tricks. If we allow this "private" character to exist and develop in our minds, it will hinder our great alliance and harm our revolutionary cause. Without seizing the power of the "private" character in our minds, we cannot truly seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Therefore, we must overthrow the "private" character and establish the "public" character.

To overthrow the "private" character and establish the "public" character, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, use Chairman Mao's books as sharp weapons to break down the "private" and establish the "public," and dare to engage in life-and-death struggle in the depths of our souls. At present, the open rectification movement being carried out by various revolutionary mass organizations is a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The proletarian revolutionary masses must, in the rectification, carry out criticism and self-criticism, raise their ideological awareness, improve their leadership style, and strengthen the unity within the revolutionary masses. Build the proletarian revolutionary mass organizations into a fighting force with high revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline.

(4) "Grasp revolution, promote production" is a great policy formulated by Chairman Mao. All proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses must enthusiastically respond to this great call from Chairman Mao, bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. While grasping revolution, we must firmly grasp production. This is an important guarantee for us to always stand unshakable.

To achieve victory in both revolution and production, the key is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In particular, we must study Chairman Mao's statements on the transformation of matter into spirit, spirit into matter, and thrift to make revolution, etc., to raise the proletarian revolutionary masses' understanding of "grasp revolution, promote production," and turn Chairman Mao's great instructions into the conscious actions of the proletarian revolutionary masses. As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we can be invincible in the struggle, defeat all enemies, and achieve great victories in the revolutionary struggle; as long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we can move mountains and fill seas, create miracles on earth, break through all the old frameworks, old regulations, and old systems that shackle the development of productive forces, overcome all difficulties, and make production better and better.

(5) The struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is being carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

In the current stage of the decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their handful of agents within the Party, the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all ghosts and monsters have come out of their lairs, colluded with each other up and down, sabotaged production, and launched counterattacks. They openly oppose Chairman Mao's class line and take revenge on the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards. We believe: The Red Guards are the vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution. Their great merits cannot be denied. The attitude towards Chairman Mao's Red Guards is also a clear dividing line between true revolution and false revolution. We must prevent ghosts and monsters from using the pretext of opposing the bourgeois reactionary line to take revenge on the class. We must, based on this situation, seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, heighten our vigilance, sharpen our eyes, and distinguish between friends and enemies. Against those who firmly oppose the people, we must timely expose their plots and tricks, fully expose their ugly faces, and firmly implement proletarian dictatorship against them.

The Revolutionary Committee of Taiyuan City calls on: All proletarian revolutionary fighters and the broad revolutionary masses must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, study in the struggle, use in the struggle, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, promote everything, and transform everything. Build Taiyuan City into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live the proletarian dictatorship!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

    把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段
    用毛泽东思想指导夺权斗争
    太原市革命委员会号召革命派自觉夺头脑中“私”字的权
    新华社太原六日电　太原市革命委员会于二月二十二日颁发了关于在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的决定，全文如下：
    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，伟大的“一月革命”风暴，正在气势磅礴、迅猛异常地席卷着全中国。我市无产阶级革命派，遵循着毛主席的革命的“三结合”的正确方针，正在团结广大的革命领导干部，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行夺权斗争。
    在无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，有千件事、万件事要做，但最根本的是要学好毛主席著作，按照毛泽东思想，解决夺权斗争中遇到的各种错综复杂的问题。
    为此，太原市革命委员会决定：全体无产阶级革命派战士和广大革命群众，一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。目前，首先要着重学好“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，《反对自由主义》，《将革命进行到底》，《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》，《论人民民主专政》，《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，学习《红旗》第三期社论和评论员文章，《人民日报》的社论等。
    在学习中，应特别注意下列几个问题：
    （一）无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的战斗号召，是无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段的战略任务。我们一定要紧紧掌握这个大方向，集中力量，自下而上地开展夺权斗争。必须充分认识，一切反动派都是不会自动退出历史舞台的，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，也决不会甘心于他们自己的失败，必然要和我们作拚死的斗争。我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，是两个阶级的大决战，一切革命同志，考虑和处理一切问题，都必须从这个大方向出发，都必须服从这个大方向。在无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，一定要认真活学活用毛主席有关夺权斗争的论述，学习十六条，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，集中目标，狠狠地打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，否则就会犯方向性的错误。
    （二）毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”在目前实行“三结合”联合夺权的伟大斗争中，特别需要认真学习毛主席的这一指示。只有坚定不移地实行“三结合”，才能形成真正的无产阶级革命派的大联合，才能保证向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的斗争取得彻底胜利。那种认为只要是当权派就一概不能相信，一概否定，统统打倒的做法，或者只把干部当作“知情人”，只让他们揭发问题，不准他们站起来革命的作法，是违背毛泽东思想的，是阶级敌人所欢迎的。因此，必须用毛主席的阶级分析方法去看待我们的干部队伍。对于那些党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派必须坚决把他们打倒，叫他们永世不得翻身；对于那些无产阶级当权派，要坚决地支持他们，相信他们，和他们联合起来进行夺权斗争；对那些一般的犯路线错误的干部，就要严格按照毛主席一贯提倡的惩前毖后、治病救人的政策和团结——批评——团结的公式去解决，帮助他们改正错误，使他们尽快回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，和他们站在一起，并肩战斗，夺取更大的胜利。
    中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的英雄的军队，是活学活用毛主席著作的模范。毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争的关键时刻，中国人民解放军立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地坚决地支持了无产阶级革命派，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献，无产阶级革命派，对此无不欢欣鼓舞。但是，那些不甘心自己灭亡的阶级敌人，却在目前掀起了一股反革命逆流，他们把斗争的矛头直接指向伟大的人民解放军，妄图破坏无产阶级专政的强大工具，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，这是资产阶级反动路线在新形势下的新反扑。我们必须充分地揭露敌人的这个新阴谋，坚决地打退这股反动势力的猖狂反扑。
    实行不实行“三结合”联合夺权，是区别执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线进行夺权，还是背离以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线进行夺权的重要标志，是真夺权还是假夺权的分界线。无产阶级革命派必须认真学习毛主席著作，深刻领会毛主席的这一伟大思想，认真执行，坚决捍卫“三结合”的革命方针。
    （三）在无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中与夺权斗争取得初步胜利后，一些革命派队伍中，滋长了资产阶级与小资产阶级的思想。例如小团体主义、宗派主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、无政府主义、自由主义、主观主义、个人主义等等错误倾向，归根结底就是一个“私”字在作怪，如果让这个“私”字在我们的头脑中存在和发展下去，就会阻碍我们的大联合，就会损害我们的革命事业。不夺我们头脑里“私”字的权，就不可能真正夺取党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。因此，必须打倒“私”字，树立“公”字。
    要打倒“私”字，树立“公”字，就必须认真学习毛主席著作，把毛主席的书，作为破“私”立“公”的锐利武器，敢于刺刀见红，自觉地在灵魂深处闹革命。目前，各革命群众组织，正在开展着的开门整风运动，就是一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。无产阶级革命派要在整风中，开展批评与自我批评，提高思想觉悟，改进领导作风，增强革命派内部的团结。把无产阶级革命派组织建设成一支具有高度革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的战斗队伍。　
    （四）“抓革命，促生产”，是毛主席制定的伟大方针。一切无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众都要热烈响应毛主席的这一伟大号召，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担。在抓革命的同时，把生产狠狠地抓起来。这是使我们永远立于不败之地的重要保证。
    要夺取革命和生产的双胜利，关键的关键，是活学活用毛主席著作。特别要学习毛主席关于物质变精神，精神变物质，节约闹革命等有关方面的论述，提高无产阶级革命派对“抓革命，促生产”的认识，使毛主席的伟大指示变成无产阶级革命派的自觉行动，只要我们掌握了毛泽东思想，就能在斗争中所向披靡，战胜一切敌人，取得革命斗争的伟大胜利；只要我们掌握了毛泽东思想，就能移山填海，创造出人间奇迹，就能冲破一切束缚生产力发展的旧框框，旧规章，旧制度，克服一切困难，把生产搞得好上加好。
    （五）无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的。
    在当前无产阶级同资产阶级及其在党内一小撮代理人的决战阶段，地、富、反、坏、右和一切牛鬼蛇神，又纷纷出笼，上下串连，互相勾结，破坏生产，反攻倒算。他们公然反对毛主席的阶级路线，对广大革命群众、革命干部和红卫兵小将进行阶级报复。我们认为：红卫兵小将，是无产阶级文化大革命运动中的先锋。对他们的伟大功勋绝不能否定。对毛主席的红卫兵抱什么态度，也是区别真革命和假革命的一个鲜明的界限。我们要防止牛鬼蛇神借反对资产阶级反动路线之名，行阶级报复之实。我们一定要根据这种情况，认真学好毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的学说和无产阶级专政的论述，提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我。对于那些坚决与人民为敌的反革命家伙，要及时识破他们的阴谋诡计，充分揭露他们的丑恶面目，对他们坚决实行无产阶级专政。
    太原市革命委员会号召：无产阶级革命派战士和广大革命群众，要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推向一个更新的阶段，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切。把太原市建设成为一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
                      一九六七年二月二十二日
