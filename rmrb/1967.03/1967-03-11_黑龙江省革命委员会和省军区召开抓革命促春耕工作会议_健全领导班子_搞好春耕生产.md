The Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province and the Provincial Military Region jointly held a conference on seizing the revolution and promoting spring ploughing. The conference emphasized that using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, and to educate the masses to further understand the great strategic significance of Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is the primary task for doing a good job in pre-ploughing production and firing the first shot for spring ploughing production.

The conference called on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers, and revolutionary cadres at all levels to unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's great directive on "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." The conference urged everyone to launch a high tide of spring ploughing production.

The conference pointed out that to do a good job in pre-ploughing and spring ploughing production, although there are many tasks to be done, the most important thing is to follow Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great directive on "seizing the revolution and promoting production," to arm the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and cadres at all levels, to mobilize them, and to unite them. All units, leading organs at all levels, and revolutionary mass organizations must take immediate action, use all propaganda tools, seize every opportunity, and extensively and deeply propagate Mao Zedong Thought, the Party's policies, Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and the great significance of doing a good job in agricultural production for promoting the development of the national economy, supporting socialist construction, and the world revolution. The conference also emphasized the great political significance of doing a good job in agricultural production in the context of nationwide class struggle. The conference called for fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses to become a powerful material force for promoting spring ploughing production.

The conference stated that the current situation in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province is excellent. Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary storm of the struggle for power by the broad masses of red rebels, the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres has swept across the entire province like a sudden storm, irresistible and unstoppable. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, soldiers and officers, and revolutionary cadres at all levels, facing the new dawn of Northeast China, are seriously implementing the instructions in the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas Across the Country" and the instructions from the Central Military Commission on "The Army's Great Support for Local Spring Ploughing Production," as well as the relevant mobilization orders from the Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province and the Provincial Military Region. They are determined to launch a high tide of pre-ploughing and spring ploughing production, to be pioneers in the revolution and models in production, to bring glory to Chairman Mao, and to add splendor to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The conference believed that immediately establishing and strengthening leading production teams at all levels and strengthening leadership is the key to doing a good job in spring ploughing production. The conference required the broad revolutionary masses in rural areas to unshakably and unconditionally loyally implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, thoroughly criticize and purge the erroneous thoughts of denying everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything about cadres.

Chairman Mao said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental changes in the social economic system." The conference firmly believed that revolution is the locomotive. Only by doing a good job in the revolution and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking can productivity be better liberated. With the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people enhanced, production can develop further. Any viewpoint that opposes revolution and production is wrong. In terms of importance, revolution must be placed first, with revolution leading production. Due to the strong seasonality of spring ploughing production, time must be seized to catch the agricultural season. In terms of time, production should occupy the main time. In general, production should be done during the day and revolution should be done at night. Be vigilant against those with ulterior motives who, under the pretext of seizing the revolution, disrupt production, or use production to suppress the revolution.

The conference pointed out that the participation of the People's Liberation Army, armed departments, and stationed troops in leading and strongly supporting spring ploughing production is an important condition for achieving dual victories in revolution and production. The Provincial Military Region and stationed troops have made specific arrangements for supporting spring ploughing production and called on the Provincial Military Region, military sub-regions, and county and city armed departments to definitely regard spring ploughing production as the current work focus and to shoulder the glorious tasks entrusted by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Stationed troops must seize the opportunity, with labor and technical forces, strongly support spring ploughing production. All soldiers and officers participating in supporting agricultural production must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, carry forward the spirit of the Three-Eight Style, observe the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, endure hardships and hard work, and unite with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to jointly carry out the revolution and jointly engage in production. Armed departments at all levels must mobilize and organize all militiamen to actively participate in spring ploughing production, become the backbone in production, and fully play the role of militiamen organizations in production.

This conference, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighted proletarian politics, took the People's Liberation Army as an example, and focused on combating active thoughts. The attendees seriously studied the relevant instructions of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Military Commission. They believed that this year's spring ploughing is coming in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The situation is excellent, and there are many favorable conditions for doing a good job in spring ploughing production. With the great call and wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres ignited in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the relatively good production foundation of last year, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army and various industries, especially with the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought guiding the direction of advance, it is definitely possible to achieve dual victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and spring ploughing production.

The conference also studied various policies of the Party in rural areas and how various industries can do a good job in supporting spring ploughing production.

This conference was held from the 1st to the 6th in Harbin. (With picture)

    黑龙江省革命委员会和省军区召开抓革命促春耕工作会议
    健全领导班子　搞好春耕生产
    新华社哈尔滨十日电由黑龙江省革命委员会和黑龙江省军区联合召开的抓革命，促春耕工作会议强调指出，用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，教育群众进一步认识毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大战略意义，是当前搞好备耕生产，打响春耕生产第一炮的首要工作。会议号召全省广大贫下中农、人民解放军指战员和各级革命干部，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，挑起革命和生产两副重担，掀起春耕生产高潮。
    会议指出，要搞好备耕、春耕生产，尽管有许多工作要做，但最重要的是遵照毛主席和党中央关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，把广大贫下中农、民兵和各级干部武装起来，动员起来，团结起来。各部队、各级领导部门、各革命群众组织要立即行动起来，运用一切宣传工具，抓紧一切机会，广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，宣传毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，宣传搞好农业生产对于促进整个国民经济发展、支援社会主义建设和世界革命的重大意义，宣传在全国全面展开阶级斗争的情况下，搞好农业生产的重大政治意义。充分调动广大革命群众的积极性，使之成为推动春耕生产的强大物质力量。
    会议表明，当前黑龙江省农村是一派大好形势。在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，广大红色造反者、人民解放军和革命领导干部三结合夺权斗争的革命风暴席卷全省，其势如暴风骤雨，锐不可挡。广大贫下中农、民兵、部队指战员和各级革命干部迎着东北的新曙光，认真贯彻执行《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》中的指示和中央军委《关于军队大力支援地方抓好春耕生产的指示》及黑龙江省革命委员会和黑龙江省军区的有关动员令，决心掀起备耕、春耕生产高潮，做革命的闯将，生产的模范，为毛主席争光，为文化大革命添彩。
    会议认为，立即建立和健全各级领导生产的班子，加强领导，是搞好春耕生产的关键。会议要求农村广大革命群众坚定不移地、不折不扣地忠实贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，彻底批判和肃清对干部否定一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的错误思想。
    毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”会议坚信：革命是火车头。只有搞好革命，促进人的思想革命化，生产力才能更好地得到解放。人的革命干劲增强了，生产才能有更大发展。任何把革命和生产对立起来的观点，都是错误的。从重要性来说，必须把革命放在第一位，以革命统帅生产。由于春耕生产季节性很强，必须争分夺秒，抓住农时，就时间来说，生产应占主要时间。在一般情况下，应该白天搞生产，晚上闹革命。要警惕那些别有用心的人，借口抓革命破坏生产，或者用抓生产来压制革命。
    会议指出，人民解放军，武装部门和驻军部队参加领导和大力支援春耕生产，是夺取革命、生产双胜利的重要条件。省军区和驻军部队对支援春耕生产作了具体部署，号召省军区、军分区和市县武装部，一定要把抓好春耕生产作为目前工作的重点，切实担负起党中央和中央军委赋予的光荣任务。驻军部队一定要不失时机，以劳力、技术力量大力支援春耕生产。参加支援农业生产的全体指战员，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，大兴三八作风，遵守三大纪律八项注意，吃大苦，耐大劳，和广大革命群众、革命干部团结一心，共同闹革命，合力搞生产。各级武装部门要发动和组织全体民兵积极参加春耕生产，成为生产中的骨干，充分发挥民兵组织在生产中的突击作用。
    这次会议高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，以人民解放军为榜样，大抓狠抓活思想。到会人员认真学习了毛主席、党中央和中央军委的有关指示，他们认为，今年的春耕是在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中到来的。形势大好，搞好春耕生产，有许多有利条件。有毛主席、党中央的伟大号召和英明领导，有广大革命群众和革命干部在文化大革命中激发出来的革命积极性，有去年比较好的生产基础，又有人民解放军和各行各业的大力支援，特别是有光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引前进的方向，一定能够取得文化大革命和春耕生产的双胜利。
    会议还研究了有关党在农村中的各项方针政策，以及各行各业如何搞好支援春耕生产等问题。
    这次会议是一日到六日在哈尔滨举行的。（附图片）
