The Thanom Group Resolutely Acts as the U.S. Imperialists' Running Dog in Aggressing Against Vietnam

Decides to Allow U.S. B-52 Bombers to Station in Thailand

New China News Agency, March 24th: Bangkok News: The puppet cabinet of Thailand held a meeting on the 21st and decided to allow U.S. B-52 bombers to station in Thailand. The U.S. imperialists' faithful running dog, the Thanom-Prapas traitorous clique of Thailand, announced on the 22nd that U.S. B-52 bombers will start stationing at the U-Tapao Air Base in the province of Chonburi from April. This shows that the Thai reactionaries are more deeply involved in the U.S. imperialists' expanded war of aggression against Vietnam.

According to Western news agencies, U.S. B-52 bombers have already been stationed at the U-Tapao Base. The U.S. has invested a large sum of dollars in Chonburi to build various military facilities.

According to the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, in addition to the U-Tapao Base, the U.S. is hurriedly building another large airport in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen that can accommodate B-52 bombers.

According to Thai newspapers, to meet the needs of the expanded war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. will build 5,369 kilometers of strategic roads and expand 4,408 kilometers of strategic roads in various provinces of Thailand from 1967 to 1971. According to the spokesman of the Thai puppet cabinet, Anurak, on the 21st, the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique will also build a strategic road from Chonburi to Nong Khai. After the completion of this strategic road, it will connect Chonburi with Lopburi, Lopburi, Nakhon Sawan, and Nong Khai, making it convenient for the U.S. to directly connect its important military bases in northeastern and eastern Thailand to the Chonburi Base, facilitating the U.S.'s expanded war of aggression.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station strongly condemned the Thanom clique's treacherous act of selling out national interests on the 23rd, pointing out that it will bring heavy disasters to the Thai nation and people. The Thai people resolutely oppose this evil act.

    他侬集团死心塌地充当美帝侵越帮凶
    竟决定让美国B—52轰炸机进驻泰国
    新华社二十四日讯　曼谷消息：泰国傀儡内阁会议二十一日决定让美国B—52型轰炸机进驻泰国。美帝国主义的忠实走狗泰国他侬—巴博卖国集团的国防部副部长他威二十二日宣布，美国B—52型轰炸机从四月开始进驻泰国梭桃邑乌塔保空军基地。这表明泰国反动派更深地卷入美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的漩涡。
    据西方通讯社一月透露，美国B—52型轰炸机早已进驻乌塔保基地。美国已在梭桃邑投下大笔美元用来修建各种军事设施。
    据“泰国人民之声”电台报道，除乌塔保基地外，美国正在泰国东北部坤敬府加紧修建另一个可供B—52型轰炸机起落的大型机场。
    据泰国报纸报道，为了适应扩大侵越战争的需要，美国将在一九六七年到一九七一年间，在泰国各府修筑五千三百六十九公里的战略公路，扩建四千四百零八公里战略公路。据泰国傀儡内阁发言人庵雷二十一日透露，美泰反动集团还要修筑一条从梭桃邑到北柳的战略公路。这条战略公路建成后，将从梭桃邑衔接廊开—呵叻—那空沙旺—北柳等府，使美国在泰国东北部、东部的各重要军事基地能直接贯通梭桃邑基地，以便于美国扩大侵略战争的行动。
      “泰国人民之声”电台二十三日强烈谴责他侬集团的这一出卖民族利益的罪行，指出它将给泰国国家和人民带来深重的灾难，泰国人民坚决反对这一罪恶行动。
