Long Spring's factory workers have recently formed eight technical service teams, each with over a hundred technical workers, to provide services in major grain-producing areas of Jilin Province and the suburbs of Long Spring. They teach agricultural techniques to commune members, repair spring plowing and irrigation machinery for communes, production brigades, and production teams, and support spring plowing production.

The revolutionary workers participating in the service teams carry Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, vowing to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go, making the technical service teams also a propaganda unit for Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary cadres of the agricultural production materials supply department in Chongqing have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" by actively organizing the supply of spring plowing materials, supporting spring plowing production with practical actions.

With the spirit of "seizing the day," they ensured that by the end of February, over 3,000 tons of fertilizers, which had been delayed due to the machinations of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, were transported to the front lines of spring plowing production. They also delivered over 2,000 tons of fertilizers and pesticides for the first quarter to various districts and counties ahead of schedule. Revolutionary workers broke through old constraints, adjusted transportation routes, and implemented direct allocation, reducing intermediate links, speeding up the transportation of fertilizers, and saving costs. They also strengthened the procurement of mixed fertilizers, providing over 1,400 tons of mixed fertilizers to rural areas.

In terms of tool supply, the department's revolutionary cadres, based on local conditions, organized production within the city, procurement outside the city, and information sharing with sister units. They timely supplied various small and medium-sized agricultural tools made of iron, wood, bamboo, and palm fiber needed for spring plowing production. So far, over 1.5 million such tools have been supplied, and the inventory of agricultural tools has reached 70% of the annual demand.

    是技术服务队　又是毛泽东思想宣传队
    长春组织技术工人下乡
    重庆农业生产资料供应部门积极供应春耕物资
    新华社长春二十五日电　长春市工厂企业的革命职工，最近组成了有一百多名技术工人参加的八个技术服务队，分赴吉林省主要产粮地区和长春市郊农村巡回服务，向农村人民公社社员传授技术，为公社、大队、生产队修理春耕、排灌机具，支援春耕生产。
    参加服务队的革命职工身带毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，表示要走到哪里学习到哪里，宣传到哪里，使技术服务队同时成为一支毛泽东思想的宣传队。
    新华社重庆二十五日电　重庆市农业生产资料供应部门的革命派，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，狠抓春耕物资组织供应工作，以实际行动支援春耕生产。
    他们用“只争朝夕”的精神，在一月下旬到二月下旬之间，不仅把由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派耍阴谋而长期积压在车站、码头的三千多吨化肥及时运到春耕生产第一线，而且把一季度供应各区、县春耕用的二千多吨化肥、农药，也全部提前运到了春耕生产第一线。广大革命职工打破旧框框，调整运输线路，进行直线调拨，减少中转环节，不仅加快了化肥的调运时间，而且节约了费用。他们还加强杂肥的收购，为农村提供了一千四百多吨杂肥。
    在农具供应方面，这个部门的革命派根据当地的具体情况，采取了市内组织生产、市外组织采购、与兄弟单位互通情况等办法，及时供应了春耕生产急需的各种农具。到目前为止，铁、木、竹、棕制的中小农具已供应一百五十多万件，库存储备的农具已达到全年需要量的百分之七十以上。
