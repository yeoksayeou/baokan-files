The revolutionary faction of the Kunming Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Agricultural Production Materials Company is vigorously pushing forward the procurement and supply of agricultural production materials to fully support spring plowing. According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Kunming on the 11th, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this company, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, immediately faced the urgent task of supporting spring plowing. They studied Chairman Mao's works with the problems and difficulties in their current work in mind, drawing strength from them. They bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, uniting with cadres and the broad masses of workers to vigorously push forward the supply and procurement of production materials. While organizing personnel to survey the needs for spring plowing materials in rural areas, they also conducted an inventory of stored materials. After clarifying their inventory and understanding the needs, they promptly dispatched procurement personnel to Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, and local areas such as Tengchong, Wenshan, and Qujing to procure bamboo and wooden farm tools, rain gear, and draft cattle.

The revolutionary faction of this company displayed the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and took effective measures to ensure that production materials were distributed to county and district supply and marketing cooperatives before spring plowing. To deliver over 2,900 tons of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers to farmers in time, they requested support from the transportation sector while organizing county and district supply and marketing cooperatives and commune vehicles, including trucks and horse-drawn carts, to expedite transportation. Ultimately, they managed to meet the seedling cultivation needs.

    狠抓采购供应工作积极支援春耕
    据新华社昆明十一日电　昆明市供销社农业生产资料公司的无产阶级革命派，狠抓农业生产资料的采购、供应工作，全力支援春耕生产，以实际行动响应我们的伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。
    这个公司的无产阶级革命派刚从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里把大权夺过来，就面临着支援春耕生产的紧迫任务。他们带着这个问题和当前工作中的困难学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中吸取力量，勇敢地承担起革命和生产两副重担，团结干部和广大职工，狠抓生产资料的供应、采购工作。他们一面组织人到农村调查春耕生产资料的需要情况，一面清理库存。弄清了家底，摸清了需要，就当机立断，派出采购员到广西、广东、贵州和省内的腾冲、文山、曲靖等地区，采购竹木农具、雨具、耕牛等。
    这个公司的革命派发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，采取有力措施，赶在春耕前把生产资料下调到县、区供销社供应农民。他们为了把两千九百多吨磷肥和氮肥及时送到农民手里，一面请求运输部门支援，一面组织县、区供销社和公社的汽车、马车加紧运输，终于赶上了育秧的需要。
