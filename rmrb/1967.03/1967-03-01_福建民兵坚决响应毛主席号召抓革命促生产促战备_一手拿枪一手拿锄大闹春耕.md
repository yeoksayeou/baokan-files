Fijian Militia Firmly Responds to Chairman Mao's Call to Seize the Revolution, Promote Production, and Prepare for War
With One Hand Holding a Gun and the Other a Hoe, They Stir Up a Spring Plowing Frenzy

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 26th – The militia on the front lines of Fujian Province, while strengthening their war preparedness, actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." With one hand holding a hoe and the other a gun, they have launched a vigorous spring plowing production campaign amidst the tumultuous Cultural Revolution. The militia unanimously declared:

"Seizing the revolution and promoting production" is the directive of our great leader Chairman Mao. We must listen to every word of Chairman Mao and carry out his instructions to the letter.

Recently, the frontline militia in Fujian have repeatedly studied the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" as well as the editorial "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production, and Fire the First Shot for Spring Plowing Production" from the People's Daily. Everyone is spirited and full of vigor, determined to achieve a bumper harvest in industry and agriculture this year. They say: Chairman Mao trusts us poor and lower-middle peasants, entrusting us with the dual tasks of revolution and production. This is the greatest honor for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will not let Chairman Mao down; we will complete this glorious task no matter what.

Many militia members have written letters and pledges to various military departments, expressing their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line, firmly carrying out the great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and taking the lead in the spring plowing production.

After in-depth study, the militia are full of confidence in victory and have quickly put the policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" into action. They actively participate in the Cultural Revolution while vigorously engaging in spring plowing production. The militia of Dongfanghong Commune's Lixin Production Brigade in Minhou County, with the spirit of "firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," braved the cold wind and jumped into the icy river to dig for fertilizer. Led by the militia, the entire brigade has already prepared over 20,000 loads of rotted fertilizer. The militia of Xiaoshan Production Brigade in Putian County's Meizhou Commune, aiming to achieve a bumper grain harvest, first solved the water source problem. They voluntarily organized a spring plowing assault team, digging wells and irrigation canals during the day and engaging in the Cultural Revolution at night. They had no stone for building the wells, so female militia member Zhang Youmei led more than ten militia members to quarry stones. After fifteen days of hard work, they quarried over 50 cubic meters of stone, finally completing two large wells. The militia company of Canglin Production Brigade in Putian County's Hanjiang Commune, amidst the tense Cultural Revolution, proactively repaired irrigation facilities, dug canals, and accumulated fertilizer. Led by the militia, the entire brigade has already accumulated over 7,000 loads of soil and miscellaneous fertilizer, completing 95% of the fertilizer accumulation task, and also built a two-li-long irrigation canal, solving the water source problem.

While vigorously engaging in production, the militia of Fujian Province patrol and stand guard day and night, closely monitoring the enemy's movements, and are ready at any moment to cooperate with the PLA to annihilate any daring invaders. The militia unanimously declared: We are stationed on the front lines of the coastal defense, facing Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. The enemy will always try to cause trouble in every possible way. We not only need to seize the revolution and promote production but also need to seize the revolution and prepare for war. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "never relaxing our fighting spirit," we will heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, and defend the Cultural Revolution and our ironclad proletarian state to the death.

    福建民兵坚决响应毛主席号召抓革命促生产促战备
    一手拿枪一手拿锄大闹春耕
    新华社福州二十六日电　地处海防前线的福建省广大民兵，在加强战备的同时，积极响应毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，一手拿锄，一手拿枪，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，掀起了大闹春耕生产的热潮。广大民兵一致表示：
  “抓革命，促生产”是我们伟大统帅毛主席的指示，毛主席的话句句要听，字字照办，坚决贯彻执行。
    最近，福建前线民兵反复学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以及《人民日报》《抓革命，促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮》的社论，人人精神焕发，个个干劲倍增，誓夺今年工农业生产大丰收。他们说：毛主席信得过我们贫下中农，把革命和生产两副重担交给我们，这是我们贫下中农的最大光荣，我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，上刀山下火海也要不折不扣地完成这一光荣任务。许多民兵还纷纷写信和写决心书给各地武装部门，表示要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的革命路线，坚决执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在春耕生产中当先锋，打头阵。
    经过深入学习，广大民兵满怀胜利信心，迅速把“抓革命，促生产”的方针落实到了行动上。他们一面积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，一面大搞春耕生产。闽侯县东方红公社立新大队民兵，以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的精神鼓舞自己，迎着寒风，跳到冰冷刺骨的河水里大挖泥肥。在民兵带动下，目前全大队已积好烂泥肥二万多担。莆田县湄洲公社下山大队民兵为了夺取粮食丰收，打算首先解决水源，他们自动组织了春耕突击队，白天开水井、挖水渠，晚上搞文化大革命。他们砌水井没有石料，女民兵张幼妹带领十多个民兵开山劈石，苦战了十五天，就打出了块石五十多立方米，终于建成了两口大水井。莆田县涵江公社苍林大队民兵连，在文化大革命的紧张情况下，主动修水利、挖水渠，大搞积肥。在民兵的积极带动下，全大队目前已经积了七千多担土杂肥，完成了积肥任务的百分之九十五，并且修筑了一条长达两华里的水渠，解决了水源。
    福建省广大民兵在大搞生产的同时，他们日夜巡逻放哨，密切注视着敌人的动静，随时准备配合解放军歼灭胆敢来犯的敌人。广大民兵一致表示：我们地处海防前哨，面对着金门、马祖、台湾，敌人总是要千方百计进行捣乱的。我们不仅要抓革命促生产，还要抓革命促战备，遵照毛主席“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”的教导，提高警惕，搞好战备，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫我们无产阶级铁打的江山。
