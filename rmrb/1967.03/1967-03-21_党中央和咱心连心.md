The Party Central Committee and Our Hearts Are United

A thunderous spring storm shakes the four seas, the Party Central Committee has written to us. The red flag burns brightly, and the battle song rings out loud; Chairman Mao has issued a new call to us! We read each word and each sentence carefully, our blood boiling with vigor. The more we read, the more we feel an extraordinary closeness; the letter speaks of the Party's boundless concern and trust in us. The more we read, the more our hearts light up; the letter speaks of the Party's greatest encouragement and hope for us. The more we read, the more we feel the weight of our responsibilities as the working class; the Party wants us to be the true masters of the state.

This is a call to arms, a weapon, giving us new strength and courage. The engines roar, and the whistles sing, quickly carrying our ironclad oaths to the Party. This great call is a new order of mobilization, and we, the working class, will respond with the utmost determination! Facing the morning sun, we will break through the waves, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will be the pioneers! With the Party and Chairman Mao behind us, we will not waver in the face of storms and tempests! Holding the four volumes of Chairman Mao's works, we will be invincible! We will guard our posts and sweat, determined to be models in production and construction! Following the Party's words, our revolutionary spirit will surge, and we will guarantee the overfulfillment of the state's plan! We dare to take on two heavy burdens, determined to achieve a double harvest in revolution and production! We will resolutely carry out and implement the "Sixteen Points," turning the factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The Party Central Committee and the working class have hearts united; Party, our oaths to you are endless. Ten thousand words condense into one sentence—wherever the Party points, we will strike! Ten thousand words condense into one sentence—we will do as Chairman Mao teaches us! The working class marches forward with red flags held high, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! The working class marches forward with red flags held high, step by step, from victory to new victory!

    党中央和咱心连心
    王恩宇春雷一声震四海，党中央给咱们写信来。红旗似火呵战歌声高，毛主席向咱发出新号召！一字字一句句细心读，咱热血滚滚劲头足。越读越觉得格外亲，信上写着党对咱的无限关怀和信
  任。越读越觉得心里亮，信上写着党对咱的最大鼓舞和期
  望。越读越觉得工人阶级担子重，党要咱当好国家主人翁。……是号角呵是武器，给咱们增添了新的力量和勇气。马达吼呵汽笛唱，快把咱钢铁的誓言带给党。这伟大的号召是新的动员令，我们工人阶级最最坚决来响应！迎着朝阳去破风浪，要在文化大革命中当闯将！有党和毛主席来撑腰，咱险风恶浪里不动摇！雄文四卷手中擎，我们永远无往而不胜！坚守岗位挥热汗，誓在生产建设中当模范！听党的话，革命干劲倍倍增，国家计划，咱保证超额去完成！敢把两副重担挑肩头，定夺取革命生产双丰收！坚决贯彻执行“十六条”，把工厂办成毛泽东思想大学校。党中央和咱工人阶级心连心，党呵，对您的誓言滔滔写不尽。千言万语凝作一句话——党指到哪呵我们打到哪！千句话并作一句说——毛主席怎样教导我们怎样做！工人阶级昂首阔步举红旗，誓把文化大革命进行到底！工人阶级昂首阔步举红旗，一步步呵，从胜利走向新胜利！
