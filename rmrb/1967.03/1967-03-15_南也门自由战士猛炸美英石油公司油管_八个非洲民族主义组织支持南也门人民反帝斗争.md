According to a report from Cairo, on the evening of the 6th, nationalists in the occupied South Yemen blew up pipelines belonging to the American and British oil companies, Esso and Texaco, in Aden. The report stated that the nationalists used thirty-five-pound bombs placed in small cans to destroy the pipelines that run from Aden to a British refinery about twenty-five miles away, causing thousands of gallons of oil to spill into the sea.

On the 5th, fifteen guards of the so-called "South Arabian Federation Government's" "Minister of Defense" (including two officers) rebelled against the brutal crimes of the British colonial authorities and the puppet regime. They went to Taizz in the Yemen Arab Republic and joined the liberation army of the South Yemen National Liberation Front, where they were warmly welcomed by the front.

According to a report from Cairo, eight African nationalist organizations jointly sent a telegram to the South Yemen National Liberation Front in the occupied South Yemen, expressing support for the struggle of the South Arabian people against British imperialism and for liberation. The telegram said: "The days of imperialism are numbered. The oppressors' evil deeds cannot stop the people's determination to gain liberation through glorious struggle. They can only promote the people's revolutionary spirit to overthrow the enemy."

The eight organizations that signed the telegram are: the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Basutoland Convention Party, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), the Swaziland Progressive Party, the South West Africa People's Organization, the Zimbabwe African National Union, and a nationalist organization from Angola.
