For Those Who Have Made Mistakes in Their Work (Song)

	Composed to the Quotations of Chairman Mao
		(Created by the "Endure the Storm" Combat Group of the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe)

		The sun rises in the east,
		The red flag flies high,
		The Chinese Communist Party
		Leads the people forward.

		The people's hearts are united,
		The people's hearts are warm,
		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain.

		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain,
		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain.

		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain,
		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain.

		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain,
		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain.

		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain,
		The people's hearts are like a sea,
		The people's hearts are like a mountain.
