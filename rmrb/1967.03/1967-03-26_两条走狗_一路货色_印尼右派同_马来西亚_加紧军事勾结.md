The right-wing military regime of Indonesia and the reactionary authorities of "Malaysia" signed a "border security agreement" on the 11th, intensifying their military collusion, attempting to suppress the just struggle of the people of North Kalimantan.

According to a joint statement issued by the military representatives of both sides in Kuala Lumpur last September, both sides have agreed to station "military liaison personnel" in the border areas of Indonesia and North Kalimantan to jointly take military actions to suppress the people of North Kalimantan.

It is reported that the right-wing military regime of Indonesia and the reactionary authorities of "Malaysia" have already established "military liaison stations" in some places in Indonesian Kalimantan and North Kalimantan last October to suppress the National Army of North Kalimantan.
