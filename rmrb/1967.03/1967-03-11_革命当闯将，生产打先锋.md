In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all the militia members of the Dazhai Brigade militia company in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, have always firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We have followed Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," leading the revolution and pioneering production. Together with the broad masses of revolutionary peasants, we have made the Cultural Revolution a resounding success and production a blazing flame.

Dazhai is a red banner personally raised by our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has called on the people of the whole country: "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture." The spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress in Dazhai has spread throughout the country. However, for a long time, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, the former Jinzhong Regional Committee, and the former Xiyang County Committee have regarded Dazhai as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. They have used every means to prevent Comrade Chen Yonggui from spreading the Dazhai experience, attempting to cut down this red banner and eliminate Comrade Chen Yonggui, who firmly holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stands on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, in order to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism. In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the militia and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dazhai Brigade bravely rose up in rebellion. Led by Comrade Chen Yonggui, they joined forces with the revolutionary masses to seize back all the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that had been usurped by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former Xiyang County Committee. They conducted a thorough settlement of accounts with their counter-revolutionary crimes.

All the militia members of Dazhai Brigade not only actively threw themselves into the torrent of the Cultural Revolution but also applied the revolutionary enthusiasm aroused in the Cultural Revolution to production. Everyone became a shock worker, and each person strove to be a vanguard.

Last year, our brigade suffered another major flood disaster, and the land of seven large gullies was completely destroyed by the floodwaters. However, the militia members of Dazhai are good fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We can withstand the collapse of the sky and fill in the sinking earth. After a winter of hard work, we finally built new stone dams on the land destroyed by the floodwaters and thickened the soil layer, laying a solid foundation for the great agricultural harvest of 1967.

Based on the restoration of the land destroyed by the floodwaters and following the great instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," the party branch decided to expand the cultivated land area and further develop agricultural production. All the militia members actively responded and happily accepted the task of treating a chaotic stone gully that had never been repaired since the cooperative movement. The leadership assigned me to lead more than seventy militia members to complete this task. At that time, the cold wind was biting, the mountains were covered with snow, the roads were slippery and difficult to travel, and the stones needed for leveling the land had to be transported from a place a mile away. However, the cold weather could not freeze our hot hearts, and the slippery and distant roads could not deter our strong revolutionary will. We are all for the revolution, and our red hearts are always warm for the people. We worked from early morning to late at night, braving the wind and snow, eating on the construction site, and fighting on the construction site. When the work was most difficult, everyone would read aloud Chairman Mao's quotation, "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," to encourage each other to overcome one difficulty after another. Through the efforts of all the militia members, in just one month, we built twelve stone dams and created new terraced fields.

At the beginning of the current spring plowing and sowing season, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued a call to arms in a letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of rural people's communes throughout the country. This letter spoke to the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and touched the hearts of us militia members. We fully support it and will carry it out to the letter. We will definitely play the role of a shock brigade in spring plowing and production, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, repair the land, repair agricultural tools, and prepare and dry the seeds. We are determined to fire the first shot in spring plowing and production. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production with our iron shoulders, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. We are determined to make production even better.

    革命当闯将，生产打先锋
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队民兵连指导员　郭凤莲
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们大寨大队民兵连的全体民兵，一直坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。我们遵照毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，革命当闯将，生产打先锋，和广大革命农民一道，把文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热火朝天。
    大寨是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自树立起来的一面红旗。毛主席向全国人民发出号召：“农业学大寨”。大寨的自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，传遍了全国。但是长期以来，原山西省委、原晋中地委、原昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，却把大寨视为眼中钉，肉中刺，千方百计阻止陈永贵同志传播大寨经验，妄想把大寨这面红旗砍掉，妄想把高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，始终坚持社会主义方向的陈永贵同志置于死地，以达到他们复辟资本主义的目的。在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，我们大寨大队的民兵和广大贫下中农奋勇地起来造反，由陈永贵同志带头，联合无产阶级革命派，把被原昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持的党、政、财、文大权，通通夺了回来，对他们的反革命罪行进行了彻底的清算。
    我们大寨全体民兵，不仅积极地投入到文化大革命的洪流中，而且把文化大革命中焕发起来的革命干劲，用到生产上去。人人充当突击手，个个争当急先锋。
    去年我们大队又遭受了一次特大洪灾，七条大沟的土地全部被洪水冲坏了。但是，我们大寨的民兵是用毛泽东思想武装起来的好汉，天塌下来我们能顶住，地陷下去我们能填平。经过一冬的奋战，终于在被洪水冲毁的土地上，修起了崭新的石堰，加厚了土层，为一九六七年的农业大丰收奠定了坚实的基础。
    在修复被洪水冲毁土地的基础上，根据我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，党支部又决定扩大耕地面积，进一步发展农业生产。我们全体民兵，积极响应，愉快地接受了治理一条合作化以来从未整修过的乱石沟的任务。领导上要我带领七十多名民兵去完成这个任务。当时，寒风刺骨，大雪封山，路滑难行，垒地用的石头要到一里地以外去运。但是，天寒地冻，冻不住我们大寨民兵火热的心，路滑路远，难不倒我们大寨民兵的坚强革命意志。我们一切为革命，全心全意为人民这颗红心永远是热呼呼的。我们每天起早贪黑，冒着风雪，吃在工地，战斗在工地。在劳动最困难的时候，大家就齐声朗读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录，鼓舞大家战胜了一个又一个的困难。经过全体民兵的努力奋战，在短短的一个月里，修成了十二条石坝，建成了一块块崭新的人工垫地。
    在当前春耕春播开始的时候，毛主席、党中央在给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信里发出了战斗的号召。这封信，字字说到了广大贫下中农的心窝里，句句谈到了我们民兵的心坎上。我们一千个拥护，一万个照办。我们一定要在春耕生产中发挥突击队作用，大力积肥，突击整修土地，整修好农具，调配、翻晒好种子，决心打好春耕生产第一炮。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用自己的铁肩挑起革命和生产两副重担，坚决把文化大革命进行到底，决心把生产搞得好上加好。
