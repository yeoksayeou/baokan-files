Chairman Mao has taught us: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably one day be hanged by the people of the whole world. Other U.S. accomplices will meet the same fate."

The U.S. imperialists, in order to further expand the war in Indochina and implement their arrogant plan to invade China, have turned Thailand into an important forward base in Asia and are intensifying their war preparations.

Recently, while continuously expanding the aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists have been continuously sending more U.S. aggressor troops to this forward base. They are also preparing to bring B-52 strategic bombers into Thailand. Currently, the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Thailand has reached over 36,000, which is more than double the total number of U.S. troops in Vietnam at the end of 1963. The number of U.S. military aircraft stationed in Thailand has reached over 400. More than 75% of the sorties of U.S. aircraft bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam take off from Thai bases.

Thailand has essentially become a giant "aircraft carrier on land" for the United States in Southeast Asia. The United States has built dozens of military bases in Thailand. The so-called "modernized airport network" established since 1960 has been completed. Meanwhile, secret missile bases and radar systems to control missiles have been established near North Petchabun north of Bangkok, as well as in Korat, Ubon, and Nakhon Phanom. In addition, more than ten naval bases and important ports have been built and expanded. To meet the needs of an expanded war, the U.S. is hurriedly building a large airport in Khon Kaen Province in northeastern Thailand. Now, the U.S. is preparing to station B-52 strategic bombers at the recently completed U-Tapao Air Base.

The strategic roads built by the U.S. in Thailand have reached over a thousand kilometers. According to Thai newspapers, the U.S. will build 5,369 kilometers of strategic roads and expand 4,408 kilometers of strategic roads in various provinces of Thailand from 1967 to 1971.

The U.S. imperialists are also arming and expanding the reactionary military of the Thanom-Praphat puppet regime in Thailand to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. in its aggressive wars and to suppress the patriotic armed forces of the Thai people.

These facts show that U.S. imperialism is sharpening its knives in Thailand. Its purpose is, on the one hand, to use Thailand as an important base to expand the aggression in Vietnam and Indochina, in a vain attempt to reverse the defeat in Vietnam. On the other hand, the U.S. imperialists' military deployments in Thailand are primarily aimed at China. U.S. publications have revealed: one of the important objectives of the U.S. is to maintain nuclear bombing bases in Thailand that can attack China. In the event of a full-scale war, "the U.S. bases in Thailand will undoubtedly play a major role in attacking China and providing important support to the North Vietnamese battlefield."

The U.S. imperialists' aggression and trampling of Thailand have aroused strong resistance from the Thai people. Now, the struggle of the Thai people to expel the U.S. and overthrow the Thanom-Praphat puppet regime is developing with the momentum of a prairie fire. The military bases established by U.S. imperialism in Thailand have already become a noose around its neck. And the Thai reactionaries who are die-hard followers of the U.S. will ultimately become the sacrificial offerings of U.S. imperialism.

### 美帝在泰国加紧战争部署

    美帝在泰国加紧战争部署
    毛主席教导我们：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”
    美帝国主义为了进一步扩大印度支那战争和推行侵略中国的狂妄计划，已把泰国变为它在亚洲的一个重要前哨阵地，并正在加紧进行战争部署。
    最近，美帝国主义在不断扩大侵越战争的同时，不断地向这个前哨基地增派美国侵略军，并且准备把Ｂ—52型战略轰炸机运进泰国。目前驻泰美军总数已达三万六千多人，这个数字等于一九六三年底侵越美军总数的两倍以上。驻在泰国的美军飞机已达四百多架。对越南民主共和国进行狂轰滥炸的美军飞机，其中百分之七十五以上架次是从泰国基地起飞的。
    泰国实际上已变成美国在东南亚的一艘巨大的“地上航空母舰”。美国已在泰国修建了几十个军事基地。从一九六○年开始建立的所谓“现代化机场网”已经完成。同时，在曼谷以北的北榄坡附近以及呵叻、乌汶、南邦等地建立了秘密导弹基地和控制导弹的雷达系统。此外，还修建和扩建了十多个海军基地和重要港口。为了适应扩大战争的需要，美帝正在泰国东北部坤敬府加紧修建大型机场。现在，美国正准备把Ｂ—52型战略轰炸机进驻建成不久的梭桃邑乌塔保空军基地。
    美帝在泰国境内修筑的战略公路已达上千公里。据泰国报纸透露，美国还将于一九六七年到一九七一年间，在泰国各府修筑五千三百六十九公里的战略公路，扩建四千四百零八公里战略公路。
    美帝国主义还大肆武装和扩充泰国他侬—巴博傀儡集团的反动军队，以便充当美帝进行侵略战争和镇压泰国人民爱国武装的炮灰。
    这些事实表明，美帝国主义正在泰国加紧磨刀。它的目的，一方面是要把泰国作为扩大侵略越南和印度支那的重要基地，妄图挽救在越南的败局；另一方面，美帝国主义在泰国的军事部署，其矛头主要是指向中国的。美国报刊透露：美国的一个重要目标，是在泰国保有可袭击中国的核轰炸基地。一旦发生全面战争，“美国在泰国的基地在袭击中国和对北越战场进行重要支援方面，肯定将起主要作用”。
    美帝国主义对泰国的侵略和蹂躏，激起了泰国人民的强烈反抗。现在，泰国人民为驱逐美帝，打倒他侬—巴博傀儡集团而进行的斗争，正以星火燎原之势发展着。美帝国主义设立在泰国的军事基地，已经成了套在它脖子上的绞索。而死心塌地追随美帝的泰国反动派，最终也一定成为美帝国主义的殉葬品。
