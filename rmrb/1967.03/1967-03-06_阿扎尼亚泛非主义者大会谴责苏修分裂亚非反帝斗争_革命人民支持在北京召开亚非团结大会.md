Azanian Pan-Africanist Congress Denounces Soviet Revisionists' Attempt to Split Asian-African Anti-Imperialist Struggle
Revolutionary People Support the Holding of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference in Beijing

	New York, March 4 (Xinhua) - The Azanian (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress deputy representative, Ahmed Ibrahim, issued a statement in London on March 3. The statement pointed out that the so-called eighth session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council, which was recently and illegally convened in Cyprus, is a "conspiracy by the Soviet revisionist leadership to split the unity of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism."

	The statement said that the Azanian (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress fully supports the anti-imperialist resolution of the fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winnipeg, which decided to hold the fifth conference in Beijing this year. The statement continued, "The revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa truly feel honored that the seven hundred million Chinese people, led by Chairman Mao Zedong, are willing to act as hosts to revolutionaries from Africa and Asia."

	The statement said that the conference held by the Soviet revisionists in the "Hilton Hotel" sponsored by the Americans attempted to overturn the historic resolutions of the Winnipeg Conference. However, contrary to the intentions of the Soviet revisionists, this conference "strengthened the revolutionary ranks of the Asian and African peoples." The statement emphasized: The split conference in Nicosia cannot split the Asian-African movement but rather distinguishes true revolutionaries from revisionists and counter-revolutionaries. True revolutionaries will fulfill their tasks more thoroughly and more powerfully.

	In the final part of the statement, Ibrahim quoted a passage from Chairman Mao's brilliant works: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools."

    阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会谴责苏修分裂亚非反帝斗争
    革命人民支持在北京召开亚非团结大会
    新华社伦敦四日电　阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会副代表艾哈迈德·易卜拉欣三日在伦敦发表新闻公报指出，最近在塞浦路斯强行非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议，是“苏修领导集团企图分裂亚非人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗中的团结的一个阴谋”。
    公报说，阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会完全支持反帝的温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议。公报接着说，亚、非革命人民确实感到荣幸的是，毛泽东主席领导下的七亿中国人民愿意担任接待来自非洲和亚洲的革命者的东道主。
    公报说，苏联修正主义者在美国人的“希尔顿饭店”策划召开的这次会议，企图推翻具有历史意义的温尼巴大会的决议，但是，与苏修的意愿相反，这次会议却“巩固了亚非人民的革命队伍”。公报强调指出：尼科西亚分裂会议并不能分裂亚非运动，而却把真正的革命者同修正主义和反革命分别开来。真正的革命者将会更加充分和更加有力地执行自己的任务。
    易卜拉欣在公报的最后引用了毛主席光辉著作中的一段话：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”
