The South Vietnamese Liberation Army heavily bombarded the U.S. military airbase in Da Nang with mortars early on the 27th. The shells fell within and around the base, immediately destroying a batch of U.S. aircraft and some buildings, and killing and injuring many U.S. and puppet troops.

According to reports from Western news agencies, this bombardment by the liberation forces plunged one of the largest U.S. airbases in South Vietnam, the Da Nang Airbase, into chaos. It also sparked a large fire that spread to the outskirts of the base. The shells not only destroyed a batch of aircraft and killed and injured many U.S. invaders in their barracks but also hit two barracks and two communication vehicles in the communication center camp. They also damaged some U.S. military telephones in Da Nang, causing long-distance phone services to be interrupted for "about twenty minutes." The base's "Army Consumer Cooperative, Officers' Club, and barracks" were also damaged in the bombardment. Due to this attack, the U.S. invaders announced that "Da Nang Airport will be closed for a period."

According to another report, on the morning of the 27th, the liberation forces also bombarded a U.S. military company and a unit of South Vietnamese puppet troops located 32 kilometers north of Saigon with mortars, causing heavy casualties and losses to the U.S. and puppet troops.

	According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the military and civilian population of the provinces of Soc Trang, Kien Giang, Ninh Thuan, and My Tho in South Vietnam bravely intercepted the invading enemy forces and annihilated more than a thousand U.S. and puppet troops.

	The military and civilian population of Soc Trang and Kien Giang provinces, in two days of anti-"sweeping" battles on the 14th and 15th, annihilated more than 600 enemy troops, including the complete annihilation of four puppet main force companies, shot down 16 enemy aircraft, damaged many more, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

	On February 14th, the U.S.-puppet group dispatched six puppet main force battalions and two armored battalions, under the cover of aircraft, to "sweep" the border area between Soc Trang and Kien Giang provinces. The military and civilian population of Soc Trang province fiercely counterattacked the enemy as soon as they entered the Luc Ninh area, repelling the enemy's multiple attacks, killing and injuring more than 200 enemy troops, completely annihilating one puppet main force company, shooting down two helicopters, and damaging many more.

	After suffering a heavy blow, the enemy was forced to turn to the Yong An commune in Long My district, Kien Giang province, to "sweep" on the 15th. The liberation forces in Kien Giang province launched a fierce and tenacious interception battle in the Clear Water Canal area of Yong An commune, attacking both the enemy's ground troops and aircraft. They intercepted the enemy, charged fiercely, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, leaving the enemy unable to resist and bodies strewn everywhere. That night, the liberation forces continued to fiercely attack the enemy's base. According to preliminary reports, the military and civilian population of Kien Giang province killed and injured more than 400 enemy troops in that day's battle, completely annihilated three puppet main force companies, shot down 13 helicopters and one fighter jet, and damaged many more.

	The military and civilian population of Ninh Thuan province, from January 26th to February 12th, consecutively foiled the enemy's two "sweeping" operations, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops, including more than 220 U.S. invaders and South Korean mercenaries, and shooting down and damaging six enemy aircraft of various types.
