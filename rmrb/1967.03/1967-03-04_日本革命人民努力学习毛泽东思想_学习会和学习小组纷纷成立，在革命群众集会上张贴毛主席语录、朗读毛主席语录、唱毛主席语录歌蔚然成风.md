Japanese revolutionary people are striving to study Mao Zedong Thought. Study groups and small study groups are springing up everywhere. At revolutionary mass meetings, posting Chairman Mao's quotations, reading Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations have become a common practice.

An increasing number of Japanese people are actively studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," applying Mao Zedong Thought in their actions. They say that this precious book is the guide to action for Japanese revolutionary people.

Recently, Mao Zedong Thought study groups and small study groups have been established like mushrooms after rain among Japanese revolutionary people. These study groups and small study groups mostly use "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" as their study material. At some revolutionary mass meetings, posting Chairman Mao's quotations, reading Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations have become a common practice. A Mao Zedong Thought study group in Nakano District, Tokyo, bought a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" for each member after its publication and focused on studying this precious book. They say, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" is the essence of Marxism-Leninism, every sentence is the truth. Studying this book has strengthened our confidence and determination to master Mao Zedong Thought as soon as possible.

A young female worker named Koga from Kyoto told a Chinese reporter: "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong is the easiest to understand. This book is the sharpest ideological weapon for transforming people's souls and changing the objective world, playing an important role in the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people."

Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon for Japanese revolutionary people to oppose U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries. A businessman from Kanagawa Prefecture who has been fighting against Japanese revisionists and severed ties with them said, revolutionaries must be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought. I always carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" with me and study it at any time. A female activist from Sugino District, Tokyo, said: "It was Chairman Mao who taught me to break with the Japanese revisionist group and choose the path of upholding the truth. Chairman Mao said: 'Communists must always be ready to uphold the truth, because any truth is in the interests of the people; Communists must always be ready to correct errors, because any error is not in the interests of the people.'"

Since last November, several publishers in Japan have published "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and about 300,000 copies have been sold. A Japanese publishing industry insider said that in Japan, no book has ever been as loved and welcomed by Japanese readers as "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." A female activist in the women's movement from Kyoto, Konno, told a Chinese reporter: "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" shines with the great Mao Zedong Thought. People carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" with them every day, studying and applying it at any time, constantly inspiring themselves to pursue the truth and struggle for the truth.

To enable more people to study this precious book, many members of the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) not only actively study "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" themselves but also actively promote it. A taxi driver in Tokyo who is enthusiastic about Japan-China friendship activities often actively promotes Mao Zedong Thought to passengers. Some passengers, inspired by him, bought "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." A small bookstore run by a member of the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) in Yokohama, despite various obstacles from Japanese revisionists, resolutely displays "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in the most prominent place to recommend it to readers.

The manager of a bookstore in Kyoto Prefecture told a Chinese reporter: "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" inspires people around the world to fight for victory. Studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the source of victory for the Japanese people and a crucial issue related to the fate of the Japanese people.

Recently, in addition to Dongfang Bookstore publishing "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to meet readers' needs, some progressive organizations and units have also selected parts of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" that have direct guiding significance for their work and printed small copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." The Japan Philatelic Association said in the preface of its printed "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong": "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" is a must-read book for 700 million Chinese people, and for Japanese people, it is also the most correct guide. We should always carry it with us, study it carefully, and apply it in practice.

Japanese famous historian Inoue Tsuyoshi told a Chinese reporter: "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" will gain more and more readers in Japan, which means that the Japanese people will further master and apply the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    日本革命人民努力学习毛泽东思想
    学习会和学习小组纷纷成立，在革命群众集会上张贴毛主席语录、朗读毛主席语录、唱毛主席语录歌蔚然成风
    越来越多的日本人民积极地学习《毛主席语录》，活学活用毛泽东思想。他们说，这本宝书是日本革命人民的行动指南。
    最近在日本革命人民中间，毛泽东思想学习会和学习小组，象雨后春笋般地成立起来。这些学习会和学习小组大都以《毛主席语录》作为学习文件。在一些革命群众的集会上，张贴毛主席语录，朗读毛主席语录，唱毛主席语录歌，已经蔚然成风。东京中野区的一个毛泽东思想学习小组，在《毛主席语录》出版以后每人购买一本，着重学习这本宝书。他们说，《毛主席语录》是马克思列宁主义的精华，句句是真理。学习了这本宝书，使我们增强了早日把毛泽东思想学到手的信心和决心。
    京都一位名叫古川的青年女工对中国记者说：“《毛主席语录》最容易懂。这本书是改造人们灵魂和改造客观世界的最锐利的思想武器，在日本人民的革命事业中起着重要作用。”
    毛泽东思想是日本革命人民反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本反动派的最强大的思想武器。神奈川县的一位坚持同日本修正主义分子斗争并与其决裂的贸易界人士说，革命者必须忠实于伟大的毛泽东思想。我经常把《毛主席语录》带在身边，随时学习。东京杉井区一位妇女活动家说：“是毛主席教导我同日本修正主义集团决裂，选择了坚持真理的道路。毛主席说：‘共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。’”
    自从去年十一月在日本由几家出版社相继出版了《毛主席语录》以来，已经销售约三十万册。日本出版界人士说，在日本从来没有过任何一本书，象《毛主席语录》这样受到日本读者的热爱和欢迎。京都一位妇女运动积极分子近藤对中国记者说：《毛主席语录》闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。人们每天把《毛主席语录》带在身边，随时随地学习和运用，时刻鼓舞自己追求真理和为坚持真理而斗争。
    为了使更多的人学习这一宝书，日中友好协会（正统）总部的许多会员，不仅自己积极学习《毛主席语录》，而且积极地宣传《毛主席语录》。东京的一位热心日中友好活动的出租汽车司机，经常主动地向乘客宣传毛泽东思想。有些乘客受到他的启发，购买了《毛主席语录》。横滨一位日中友好协会（正统）总部会员经营的小书店，尽管受到日本修正主义分子的种种阻碍，但是它坚决地把《毛主席语录》陈列在最显著的地方，以便于向读者推荐。
    京都府一家书店的负责人对中国记者说：“《毛主席语录》鼓舞着世界人民胜利地进行斗争。学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是日本人民取得胜利的源泉，是关系到日本人民命运的重要问题。”
    最近，除了东方书店为了满足读者需要出版了《毛主席语录抄》之外，一些进步团体和单位还从《毛主席语录》中选择对自己工作有直接指导意义的部分，印制小型的《毛主席语录抄》。日本集邮协会在它印制的《毛泽东语录抄》的前言中说：《毛主席语录》是中国七亿人民必读的书，对于日本人民来说，它也是最正确的指南针。我们要经常把它带在身边，精读它，做到活学活用。
    日本著名历史学家井上清对中国记者说：“《毛主席语录》在日本将获得日益众多的读者，这意味着日本人民将更进一步掌握和活学活用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”
