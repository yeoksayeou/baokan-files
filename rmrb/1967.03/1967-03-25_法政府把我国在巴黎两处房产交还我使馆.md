The French government on the afternoon of the 20th formally returned two properties in Paris to the Chinese Embassy in France.

The two properties are: No. 11 Avenue George V and No. 47 Rue de Pergolèse.

Before France recognized the People's Republic of China in 1964, these two buildings were respectively used by the so-called "embassy" and "consulate" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in France.

Later, they were illegally occupied by the so-called "representative office" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

Last March 12, after the French authorities expelled the Chiang bandits, they took over these two buildings.

    法政府把我国在巴黎两处房产交还我使馆
    新华社巴黎电　法国政府二十日下午把中国在巴黎的两处房产正式交还给中国驻法国大使馆。
    这两处房产是：乔治第五大街十一号和佩尔戈勒塞街四十七号。
    在法国一九六四年承认中华人民共和国以前，这两座房屋分别由蒋介石匪帮驻法国的伪“大使馆”和伪“总领事馆”使用。
    此后，又被蒋介石匪帮原驻联合国教育、科学及文化组织的所谓“代表团”非法占据。
    去年三月十二日，法国当局把蒋帮分子赶走以后，对这两座房屋实行了接管。
