Whether or not we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy is an important indicator of whether we can carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The key to the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" lies in the two characters "revolution." To achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must oppose eclecticism, oppose conciliationism, and oppose synthesis. This is because eclecticism, conciliationism, and synthesis are anti-Marxism-Leninism, anti-Mao Zedong Thought. They distort revolutionary dialectics, deny the struggle between opposites, and strip away the soul of revolution, making them thoroughgoing revisionism. Their characteristic is to not distinguish between enemies and ourselves, not to distinguish between classes, not to distinguish between right and wrong. Their usual trick is to combine various opposing things without principle. It seems impartial and unbiased, neither opposing this nor opposing that, but in reality, it stands on the side of reactionary forces.

Any contradiction is irreconcilable and must be resolved through struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Contradictions and struggles are universal and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of struggle, differ according to the nature of the contradictions." In class struggle, when revolutionary forces are advancing and reactionary forces are retreating, eclecticism and conciliationism can only help the doomed reactionary forces to prolong their existence and obstruct the victorious development of revolutionary forces. However, the law of historical development is unchangeable, and the inevitable doom of all class enemies is predetermined.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to jointly seize power. A major issue before us is: to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end or to stop halfway. At this time, the harm of eclecticism is even more prominent. The closer the revolution is to final victory, the more the enemy will make their last struggle. On one hand, they continue to resist stubbornly and wait for an opportunity to counterattack, on the other hand, they strive to stop the revolution; if it is to advance, they will use every means to make the revolution "take on a mild color." They do this to "gain an opportunity to heal their wounds, and then pounce in one morning, strangling the revolution to death." Eclecticism and conciliationism just meet the needs of the class enemy in this way. Therefore, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must display the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground, and thoroughly criticize the fallacies of eclecticism, conciliationism, and synthesis.

Eclecticism is actually unworkable. Imagine, combining the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, combining the revolutionary faction of the proletariat with those in power who are taking the capitalist road, is this possible? It is absolutely not possible. Eclecticism is completely a deceitful thing. Its essence is to not want struggle, not want revolution, to confuse revolution with counterrevolution, to confuse the proletariat with the bourgeoisie, to mix the proletarian revolutionary line with the bourgeois reactionary line. The result can only be to maintain and restore the old order of the bourgeoisie, serving the counterrevolutionary class to restore power.

Currently, some party members who are taking the capitalist road are distorting and falsifying the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, castrating its revolutionary content, and promoting eclecticism in every possible way, trying to disguise themselves as "revolutionary cadres" or "cadres who have made general mistakes," attempting to sneak into the "three-in-one combination" power structure. Some even arrogantly shout: if the revolutionary faction does not "combine" with them, it is a "wrong direction." There are also some who are working hard to shield party members who are taking the capitalist road, trying to force them into the "three-in-one combination" power structure and impose them on the revolutionary masses. It must be pointed out that this is a manifestation of the capitalist counterrevolutionary restoration tide, a manifestation of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. All revolutionary comrades must be vigilant, keep their eyes open, and give the most resolute rebuttal!

It should also be pointed out that within the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, some comrades, due to insufficient understanding of the dangers of eclecticism, sometimes have confused views and wrong practices on the issue of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Some comrades are eager for quick results, neglecting to do in-depth and detailed work, not paying enough attention to upholding principles, distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, distinguishing between right and wrong, but impatiently pursuing "combination." This way, it is very easy for class enemies to find loopholes. Revolutionary factions should pay attention to this.

To achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must use the class analysis method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish between different types of cadres.

For revolutionary cadres, especially those leading cadres who implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must fully value their role in the temporary power structure of the "three-in-one combination." Revolutionary leading cadres can become the core and backbone of the temporary power structure.

For the handful of party members who are taking the capitalist road, for all class enemies, we must overthrow them, fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to the end, there is no "combination" with them.

For cadres who have made mistakes, we demand to distinguish between right and wrong. If they can criticize their mistakes, correct their mistakes, and draw a clear line with the handful of party members who are taking the capitalist road, and draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, truly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they can and should be united with them, and combine with them to fight together. Many of them can also participate in the temporary power structure of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." If cadres who have made mistakes do not dare to reform themselves, but persist in their mistakes, do not draw a clear line with the handful of party members who are taking the capitalist road, and do not draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, then there is no premise for combining with them. Before they criticize and correct their mistakes, we cannot combine with them. We will also not allow anyone to impose such people on the revolutionary masses and force them into the power structure of the "three-in-one combination."

Those who have made serious mistakes but insist on not changing, if they use the "three-in-one combination" as an excuse to launch a counterattack and counterattack the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, then the nature of their contradictions with the party and the revolutionary masses will change, and they may slide to the road of anti-party and anti-socialism.

In summary, only by opposing eclecticism, conciliationism, and synthesis can we achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue."

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country presents a great situation. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, advance victoriously, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely defeat the capitalist counterrevolutionary restoration tide, seize the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    打倒折中主义，坚持革命的“三结合”
    毛泽东思想哲学社会科学部《进军报》编辑部
    是不是坚决执行毛主席制定的革命的“三结合”方针，是检验能否贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线的一个重要标志。
    革命的“三结合”，关键全在于“革命”两字。
    要做到革命的“三结合”，就必须反对折中主义，反对调和主义，反对合二而一。因为折中主义、调和主义、合二而一是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的。它歪曲革命的辩证法，否认对立面的斗争，抽掉了革命的灵魂，是彻头彻尾的修正主义。它的特点是不分敌我，不分阶级，不分是非。它所惯用的手法就是把各种对立的事物无原则地结合起来。看来貌似公允，不偏不倚，这也不反对，那也不反对，实际上却是站在反动势力一边去了。
    任何矛盾都是不可调和的，都必须通过斗争才能解决。毛主席教导我们：“矛盾和斗争是普遍的、绝对的，但是解决矛盾的方法，即斗争的形式，则因矛盾的性质不同而不相同。”在阶级斗争中，当着革命势力节节胜利，反动势力节节败退的时候，折中主义、调和主义只能是帮助将要灭亡的反动势力苟延残喘，阻挠革命势力的胜利发展。但是，历史的发展规律是不能改变的，一切阶级敌人的必然灭亡是注定了的。
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命已经进入实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权的新阶段，摆在我们面前的一个大问题是：把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底呢，还是半途而废。在这个时候，折中主义的危害就更突出了。因为革命愈是接近最后胜利，敌人就愈是要作最后的挣扎。他们一方面继续负隅顽抗，伺机反扑，另一方面竭力使革命就此止步；如果再要前进，则千方百计地使革命“带上温和的色彩”。他们这样做，是为了使自己“赢得养好创伤的机会，然后在一个早上猛扑过来，将革命扼死”。折中主义、调和主义正好迎合阶级敌人的这种需要。因此，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须发挥痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，彻底批判折中主义、调和主义、合二而一的论调。
    折中主义实际上是行不通的。试想，把无产阶级和资产阶级，把无产阶级革命派和走资本主义道路的当权派折中一下，调和起来，合二而一，是可能的吗？根本不可能。折中主义完全是一种骗人的东西。它的实质是不要斗争，不要革命，把革命和反革命混淆起来，把无产阶级和资产阶级混为一谈，把无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线搞在一块。其结果只能是维护和恢复资产阶级的旧秩序，为反动阶级复辟服务。
    目前，有些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，歪曲和篡改革命的“三结合”方针，阉割它的革命内容，大搞折中主义，千方百计地把自己装扮成是“革命干部”或者是“犯有一般错误的干部”，企图混入“三结合”的权力机构。甚至狂妄地叫嚷：如若革命派不同他们“结合”就是犯了“方向错误”。还有一些人是煞费苦心地包庇党内走资本主义道路的当权派，要把他们硬拉进“三结合”的权力机构，强加在革命群众头上。必须明确指出，这是资本主义反革命复辟逆流的一种表现，是资产阶级反动路线新反扑的一种表现。一切革命的同志，务必提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，并且给予最坚决的回击！
    还应指出，在无产阶级革命派内部，有些同志由于对折中主义的危险性认识不足，有时在对待革命的“三结合”的问题上，存在着一些糊涂观点和错误做法。有的同志急于求成，忽略了做深入细致的工作，没有充分注意坚持原则，分清敌我，分清是非，而是迫不及待地去追求“结合”。这样就很容易被阶级敌人钻空子。革命派应该引起注意。
    要实现革命的“三结合”，就必须用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级分析的方法，来区别对待不同类型的干部。
    对于革命干部，特别是执行毛主席的革命路线的领导干部，必须充分重视他们在“三结合”的临时权力机构中的作用。革命的领导干部可以成为临时权力机构的核心和骨干。
    对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对于一切阶级敌人，我们必须把他们打倒，把他们斗倒斗垮斗臭，同他们是没有什么“结合”可言的。
    对于犯错误的干部，我们则要求分清是非。如果他们能够检讨错误，改正错误，能够同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，真正站到毛主席的革命路线一边，就可以而且应该团结他们，和他们结合起来，共同战斗。其中许多人还可以参加革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。犯错误的干部如果不敢于革自己的命，而是坚持错误，不同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，不同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，那末，就没有同他们结合的前提。在他们没有检讨错误，改正错误以前，我们就不能同他们结合。我们也绝不容许任何人把这样的人强加给革命群众，硬拉进“三结合”的权力机构中去。
    那些犯有严重错误而又坚持不改的人，如果借口“三结合”，搞反攻倒算，向无产阶级革命派进行反扑，那末，他们同党同革命群众矛盾的性质就会转化，就可能滑到反党反社会主义的绝路上去。
    总之，只有反对折中主义、调和主义、合二而一，才能做到革命的“三结合”。我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风。在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命呈现出一片大好形势。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命的“三结合”方针，乘胜前进，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决击溃资本主义反革命复辟逆流，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
