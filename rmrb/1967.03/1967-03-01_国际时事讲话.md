International Current Affairs Commentary

The Armed Struggle of the African People is in a Great Situation

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses of the people."

The armed struggle of the African revolutionary people against imperialism and its lackeys is in a great situation.

The broad masses of guerrilla fighters in the Congo (Leopoldville) rely firmly on the people, continuously strengthen the political and ideological work among the troops and the people, mobilize and organize the broad masses of people in cities, towns, and enemy-occupied areas, and gradually establish a broad anti-imperialist, patriotic, and united front. In some areas, the guerrilla fighters help the people with production labor. The fighters also open up land to farm and raise livestock to reduce the burden on the people. Therefore, the patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Leopoldville) have gained the support of the broad masses of the people. They have overcome various difficulties and continuously struck the puppet army and mercenaries.

In the western Kwilu region, the patriotic armed forces led by Mulumba have developed from an initial few guns to a force of more than ten thousand, and have established a vast base area. Under the direction of the American imperialists, the Mobutu puppet regime has, since the beginning of last year, carried out a brutal "sweep" in this region and established so-called "resettlement camps" similar to the "strategic hamlets" in South Vietnam, in an attempt to sever the connection between the guerrillas and the people.

The guerrillas, using the forest as their base, have resolutely struck the puppet army and have established political committees within the "resettlement camps" to lead the people in their struggle. With the support of the broad masses of the people, the guerrillas have foiled the puppet army's "sweep" and launched a counteroffensive. Under the support of the people, the patriotic guerrillas have mastered all the movements of the puppet army, making the puppet army completely passive and on the defensive. Through the counteroffensive, the patriotic armed forces have greatly expanded their base areas.

In the northeastern region, the guerrillas continue to strike the puppet army and mercenaries' "sweep," making it impossible for the enemy to enter the area near Stanleyville.

The leaders of the armed struggle of the Angolan people also attach great importance to mobilizing the masses. An Angolan leader said: "Our fundamental work must be done among the masses within our country, because only by mobilizing and organizing the masses in the guerrilla areas can we achieve the final victory of the people's war." Currently, the guerrilla war in Angola is being waged in the provinces of Cabinda, Luanda, and the southeastern region near Mozambique. The southeastern front was opened last year. In this region alone, about a thousand Portuguese colonial troops were annihilated last year. Currently, the guerrilla war in this vast area of more than eighty thousand square kilometers is developing rapidly.

In Mozambique, the patriotic armed forces have already established solid bases in two provinces and are conducting extensive activities in two other provinces. The activities of the patriotic armed forces have expanded to nearly half of the country. With the support of the broad masses of the people, the patriotic armed forces have made fifty thousand colonial troops run around in circles.

Of course, the road of the armed struggle of the African people against imperialism is tortuous and difficult. However, as long as the masses are fully mobilized and relied upon, they can stand unshakable and make imperialism and its lackeys drown in the vast ocean of the people.

The Indonesian Rightist Military Expose Their True Colors

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The governments of Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Franco, Chiang Kai-shek, and others have either abolished or simply not used the curtain of bourgeois democracy within their own ranks because the class struggle within their countries has reached an extreme point, and it is more advantageous for them to abolish or simply not use the curtain, lest the people also use the curtain to dance wildly."

On February 22, under the pressure of the rightist military clique of Suharto-Nasution, who are lackeys of American imperialism, Sukarno issued a proclamation, announcing the "transfer" of the "presidential powers" to the head of the rightist military clique, Suharto. Suharto took away the last bit of Sukarno's facade of "presidential powers," thus completely exposing the fascist ugly face of the rightist military clique in broad daylight.

Before this, the Indonesian rightist military clique had launched an unprecedented fierce anti-Sukarno movement and issued an ultimatum, forcing Sukarno to step down voluntarily. In fact, this "transfer" of "presidential powers" by Sukarno is just a formality. Since the October 1965 counter-revolutionary military coup directed by American imperialism, the Indonesian rightist military clique has gradually seized state power by force. In March last year, they established a cabinet controlled by Suharto by force, followed by the cancellation of Sukarno's "lifetime presidency" in July, and then the formation of a cabinet chaired by Suharto, which is anti-communist and anti-people, stripping Sukarno of his leadership over the cabinet. Therefore, Sukarno's "presidential powers" have long been a mere "symbol." This time, the rightist military clique completely discarded Sukarno's signboard, indicating their determination to tear off all their cover-ups, to implement naked fascist dictatorship internally, and to more brazenly serve as the lackeys of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists in the anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China military alliance in Southeast Asia.

Since the rightist military clique came to power, fascist terror has shrouded the entire Indonesia. This bunch of fascist bandits has, internally, massacred hundreds of thousands of communists and patriots, ruthlessly plundering the people's blood and sweat, causing economic collapse and people's suffering; externally, they have eagerly kowtowed to the U.S., serving as anti-China clowns. Therefore, such a fascist regime has received strong praise and support from the imperialists and revisionists. After the rightist military clique came to power, the U.S. immediately provided them with a large amount of "economic aid," giving them eight million dollars this year alone, followed by another one million dollars. The Soviet revisionist clique is also not lagging behind. According to reports from Western news agencies, "the Soviet Union is prepared to continue providing spare parts to the Indonesian armed forces through credit," helping the reactionaries to massacre the people. Even the Indian reactionaries, who cannot open their own pots, are also "aiding" the Indonesian rightist regime.

However, the rampancy of the Indonesian reactionaries does not indicate their strength but rather their weakness. The fascist dictatorship of the rightist military clique will inevitably further intensify the contradictions between the Indonesian people and U.S.-led imperialism and the class contradictions within the country. Suharto's reactionary "dynasty" is built on a volcano. The various oppressions of imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries on the people will ultimately only promote a more intense revolution of the people.

The Imperialist Camp is Rapidly Splintering

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The population of the imperialist camp is only about four hundred million, and they are divided within. An 'earthquake' will occur there."

In recent years, the internal contradictions within the imperialist camp have further intensified, and the process of the imperialist camp's disintegration has further accelerated.

The struggle between the United States and Western European countries, especially France, over control and counter-control, has become increasingly fierce. In July last year, France, taking advantage of the U.S. being bogged down in the Vietnam War and the U.S. strategic focus shifting from Europe to Asia, withdrew from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military "integration" organization controlled by the U.S. and ordered the organization and the U.S. command and military bases within its territory to withdraw by April this year. France's action dealt a heavy blow to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and shook the U.S. hegemony in Western Europe.

The other two military alliances that the U.S. has painstakingly put together—the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization—have either become paralyzed or have become mere shells due to the impact of the Asian people's revolutionary storm.

The economic contradictions between the United States and Western European countries have also become increasingly sharp. France, taking advantage of the dollar's shaky position, proposed to completely break the dollar's monopoly in the international monetary system and used a large amount of dollars to exchange for gold; other countries followed suit. The imperialist countries held a "Group of Ten" finance ministers' meeting last year to discuss the reform of the international monetary system. France not only firmly opposed the U.S. proposal for monetary reform but also proposed to double the price of gold in October last year, causing the U.S. gold to flow out rapidly.

In Europe, the struggle between France and West Germany for hegemony in Western Europe is still going on intermittently. Since the West German government of Brandt came to power in December last year, the two sides have held several talks, but the main differences have not been resolved. The Brandt government believes that the U.S. has a legitimate position in Europe, while France opposes it; the Brandt government strongly advocates Britain's entry into the "Common Market," but France also opposes it.

The contradictions between France and Britain over the "Common Market" issue have not been resolved. Britain, due to its gradually declining international status, strongly demands to join the "Common Market" to ease Britain's diplomatic, political, and economic crises. However, since Britain's entry into the "Common Market" will weaken France's advantageous position in the "Common Market," France still firmly rejects Britain's entry. British Prime Minister Wilson and Foreign Minister Brown recently visited Bonn, trying to open a gap for Britain's entry into the "Common Market." However, due to France's obstruction, no results were achieved.

As the revolutionary forces of the world's people further strengthen and the contradictions between the imperialists intensify, the imperialist camp will further disintegrate.

    国际时事讲话
    非洲人民武装斗争形势大好
    毛主席教导我们：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”
    非洲革命人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，正是一片大好形势。
    刚果（利）广大游击战士坚决依靠人民群众，不断加强部队和人民群众的政治思想工作，动员和组织城市乡村和敌占区的广大人民，逐步建立一个广泛的反帝爱国统一战线。有些地区的游击战士，帮助群众进行生产劳动。战士们还自己开荒种地，饲养家畜，以减轻人民群众的负担。因此，刚果（利）爱国武装力量得到了广大人民支持。他们克服了种种困难，不断打击傀儡军和雇佣军。
    在西部克韦卢地区，由缪勒尔领导的爱国武装部队，已经从最初的两三枝枪，发展为万人以上的强大力量，并且建立了广大的根据地。蒙博托傀儡政权，在美帝指使下，从去年初开始，对这个地区进行了残酷的“扫荡”，并建立了类似南越“战略村”的所谓
  “收容站”，妄想隔断游击队和人民群众的联系。
    游击队以森林为基地，对伪军进行坚决打击，并且在“收容站”内成立了政治委员会，领导群众进行斗争。在广大群众支持下，游击队挫败了伪军的“扫荡”，并且展开了反攻。在群众支持下，爱国游击队掌握了伪军一切调动情况，使伪军完全陷入被动挨打的处境。通过反击，爱国武装大大扩展了自己的根据地。
    在东北部地区，游击队继续打击伪军和雇佣军“扫荡”，使敌军无法进入在斯坦利维尔附近一带地区。
    安哥拉人民武装领导人也很重视发动群众的工作。安哥拉的一位领导人说：“我们的根本工作要在我们国内的群众中进行，因为只有动员和组织游击区的群众，才能取得人民战争的最后胜利。”目前，安哥拉游击战正在喀奔达省、罗安达省和东南部邻近莫三鼻给地区进行。其中东南战线是去年开辟的。去年一年中，仅这个地区就歼灭葡萄牙殖民军约一千人。目前，游击战在这个八万多平方公里广大地区内发展很快。
    在莫三鼻给，爱国武装目前已经在两个省建立了巩固的基地，并在另外两个省展开了广泛活动。爱国武装的活动已经扩大到全国近一半的地区。在广大人民支持下，爱国武装使五万多殖民军疲于奔命。
    当然，非洲人民的反帝武装斗争的道路是曲折的、艰难的，但是，只要充分发动群众，依靠群众，就可使自己立于不败之地，并使帝国主义及其走狗在人民群众的汪洋大海中陷于灭顶之灾。
  印尼右派军人扯掉遮羞布
    毛主席教导我们：“希特勒、墨索里尼、东条、佛郎哥、蒋介石等人的政府取消了或者索性不用那片资产阶级内部民主的幕布，是因为国内阶级斗争紧张到了极点，取消或者索性不用那片布比较地有利些，免得人民也利用那片布去手舞足蹈。”
    二月二十二日，苏加诺在美帝国主义走狗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团的逼迫下，发表公告，宣布把“总统职权”“移交”给右派军人集团头目苏哈托。苏哈托把苏加诺最后一点装潢门面的“总统职权”也拿过去，这就完全把右派军人集团的法西斯狰狞面目暴露在光天化日之下了。
    在此之前，印尼右派军人集团曾发动了一场空前猛烈的倒苏加诺运动，并下了最后通牒，逼迫苏加诺自动下台。其实，这次苏加诺“移交”“总统职权”，不过是个形式而已。自从一九六五年十月，印尼右派军人集团在美帝国主义指使下发动反革命军事政变以来，就一步步用武力夺取了国家政权。去年三月，他们用武力建立了由苏哈托控制的内阁，接着在七月取消了苏加诺的“终身总统”头衔，随后即组成由苏哈托担任内阁主席团主席的反共反人民的内阁，剥夺了苏加诺对内阁的领导权。因此，苏加诺的“总统职权”早已成了一个“象征”。这次右派军人集团把苏加诺这块招牌完全丢掉，表明他们决心撕下一切遮羞布，对内实行赤裸裸的法西斯专政，对外更露骨地充当美帝和苏修在东南亚的反人民、反革命、反华军事联盟的小走卒。
    自从右派军人集团上台以来，法西斯恐怖笼罩着整个印度尼西亚。这批法西斯暴徒，对内屠杀了几十万共产党人和爱国人士，拚命搜刮人民的血汗，弄得经济崩溃，民不聊生；对外极力投靠美帝，充当反华小丑。因此，这样一个法西斯政权，得到了帝修反的大力赞赏和支持。右派军人集团上台后，美国即向它提供了大量的“经济援助”，仅从今年以来，先给八千万美元，后又给一千万美元。苏修集团也不甘落后。据西方通讯社报道，“苏联准备继续通过信贷向印尼武装部队提供备件”，帮助反动派屠杀人民。连自己揭不开锅的印度反动派，也对印尼右派政权进行“援助”。
    但是，印尼反动派的猖獗，并不表明它的强大，相反，却是它的虚弱的表现。右派军人集团的法西斯专政，必然要使印度尼西亚人民同以美国为首的帝国主义的矛盾和国内的阶级矛盾进一步激化。苏哈托的反动“王朝”，是建立在火山口上的。帝国主义和印尼反动派对人民的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更剧烈的革命。
  帝国主义阵营加速四分五裂
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。那里会发生‘地震’。”
    近年来，帝国主义阵营的内部矛盾进一步激化，帝国主义阵营分崩离析的过程进一步加速。
    美国同西欧国家特别是同法国之间的控制和反控制的斗争，日益激烈。去年七月，法国趁着美国深陷侵越战争的泥潭，趁着美国战略重点从欧洲移至亚洲的时机，退出了由美国控制的北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构，并且限令这个集团和美国在法国境内的司令部与军事基地在今年四月以前统统撤出。法国的这一行动，给了北大西洋集团沉重的一击，动摇了美国在西欧的霸权。
    美国苦心拼凑的另外两个军事集团——东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织，由于亚洲人民革命风暴的冲击，或者已陷于瘫痪，或者已名存实亡。
    美国同西欧国家的经济矛盾也日益尖锐化。法国趁美元摇摇欲坠之机，提出彻底打破美元在国际货币制度中的垄断地位，同时用大量美元挤兑黄金；其它国家也群起效尤。帝国主义国家曾在去年召开了“十国集团”财长会议，讨论改革国际货币问题。法国不仅坚决反对美国改革货币的建议，而且去年十月又提出把黄金价格提高一倍，美国黄金因此而高速流失。
    在欧洲，法德之间争霸西欧的斗争仍在忽明忽暗地进行着。去年十二月西德基辛格政府上台以来，双方进行了几次会谈，但是主要分歧仍未解决。基辛格政府认为美国在欧洲有合法地位，而法国反对；基辛格政府极力主张让英国加入“共同市场”，法国也反对。
    法英之间在“共同市场”问题上的矛盾也没有解决。英国由于自己的国际地位逐渐衰落，强烈要求加入“共同市场”以缓和英国外交、政治、经济的危机。但是，由于英国加入“共同市场”将会削弱法国在“共同市场”中的有利地位，因此，法国仍坚决拒绝英国加入“共同市场”。英国首相威尔逊、外长布朗，最近到波恩访问，想为英国的进入“共同市场”打开一个缺口。但是由于法国的阻力，并未取得结果。
    随着世界人民革命力量的进一步壮大，随着帝国主义之间矛盾的激化，帝国主义阵营必将进一步四分五裂。
