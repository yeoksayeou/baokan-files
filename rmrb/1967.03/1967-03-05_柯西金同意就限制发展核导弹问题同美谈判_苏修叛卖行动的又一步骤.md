Khrushchev Agrees to Negotiate with the US on Limiting Nuclear Missile Development
Another Step in the Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal

New York, March 3 (Xinhua) — Washington: According to a report from U.S. President Johnson's press conference on the 2nd, while the U.S. and the Soviet Union are intensifying negotiations on issues such as "preventing nuclear proliferation," the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has agreed to begin negotiations with the U.S. on the so-called limitation of nuclear missile development. This is another deceitful and treacherous act of surrender by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism, in order to carry out its global aggression plan, has, after a long period of nuclear armament, already stockpiled a large number of nuclear weapons and established a nuclear missile attack system. It now demands negotiations with the Soviet Union on the limitation of the development of anti-missile missile systems (so-called defensive missile systems) and offensive missiles, with the main purpose of maintaining the U.S.'s position of nuclear blackmail against other countries. At the same time, it is also to divert funds used for this purpose to pay for the ever-increasing expenses of the Vietnam War.

Johnson said that the proposal for negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the above issues was made in a letter he wrote to Khrushchev in January this year. This letter was then delivered to Khrushchev by the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson.

Johnson announced at the press conference that he had received a reply from Khrushchev, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate on this issue, which made him "very pleased." He also said that the negotiations would first be conducted by the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union in Moscow. He hopes that the negotiations can "begin as soon as possible."

At the same time, Johnson emphasized that during the negotiations, the U.S. believes there is "no reason to stop the work we are currently doing" (i.e., research and development of anti-missile missile systems). This shows that their negotiations are completely deceiving the world's people.

Johnson also highly praised the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's recent intensified collusion with the U.S. in various aspects. He said that the deals made by the U.S. and the Soviet Union on issues such as civil aviation agreements, cultural agreements, consular agreements, and space agreements, as well as the progress made on the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation," are all "very desirable actions that are in line with U.S. national interests."

    柯西金同意就限制发展核导弹问题同美谈判
    苏修叛卖行动的又一步骤
    新华社三日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国总统约翰逊二日在记者招待会上透露，在美苏两国正在就“防止核扩散”等问题加紧进行交易的时候，苏联修正主义统治集团又同意就所谓限制发展核导弹问题同美国开始谈判。这是苏修统治集团迎合美帝国主义需要而采取的又一个欺世惑众的投降和叛卖行动。
    美帝国主义为了推行它的全球侵略计划，在进行了长期的核扩军之后，目前已经储存了大量核武器，建立了核导弹进攻体系。它现在要求同苏联谈判限制发展反导弹导弹体系（即所谓防御性导弹体系）和进攻性导弹的问题，目的主要是为了保持美国对别国进行核讹诈的地位，同时也是为了把用于这方面的经费用来支付开支日益浩大的侵越战费。
    约翰逊说，由美苏两国就上述问题进行谈判的建议，是他今年一月在写给柯西金的一封信里向苏联方面提出的。这封信当时由新任美国驻苏大使汤普森带交给了柯西金。
    约翰逊在记者招待会上宣布，他已经收到了柯西金的复信，表示苏联愿意就这个问题进行谈判，这使他“很愉快”。他还说，谈判将首先由美国驻苏大使在莫斯科进行。他希望谈判能“尽早开始”。
    同时，约翰逊强调，在谈判期间，美国认为“没有理由使我们正在进行的工作（即研究和发展反导弹导弹体系）停下来”。这就说明了，他们的这种谈判完全是愚弄世界人民。
    约翰逊还极力赞赏苏修统治集团最近在各个方面同美国加紧勾结。他说，美苏在签订民航协定、文化协定、领事协定、空间协定等问题上作成的交易以及在“防止核扩散”问题上，取得的进展等等，“都是符合美国国家利益的非常可取的行动”。
