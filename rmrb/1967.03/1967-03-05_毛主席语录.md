	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last desperate struggle. Even after the country has been pacified, they will still try to create trouble and make trouble in various ways. They will try every day and every moment to stage a comeback in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance.

    毛主席语录
    帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。
                《在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词》
