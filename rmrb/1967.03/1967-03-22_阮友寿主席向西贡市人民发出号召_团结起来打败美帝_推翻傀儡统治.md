Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho Calls on the People of Saigon to Unite and Defeat the American Imperialists and Overthrow the Puppet Regime

	New China News Agency Hanoi, March 21st - According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently wrote a letter to the people of Saigon on the 17th anniversary of the "March 19" anti-American struggle day, calling on them to further unite broadly and, together with the people of the entire country, thoroughly defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Saigon puppet regime.

	The letter states that over the past 17 years, the people of Saigon have inherited and carried forward the spirit of "March 19," continuously launching magnificent struggles in the enemy's stronghold and achieving ever-greater victories.

	The letter points out that although the American imperialists have suffered a crushing defeat, due to their extremely vicious nature, they continue to send more troops and increase weapons to South Vietnam in order to expand the war to an unprecedented scale.

	The letter further points out that while expanding the war, the American imperialists are constantly playing the "peace talks" trick. Their conditions are: the North must stop helping their fellow countrymen in the South who are suffering from aggression, the people in the South must stop their self-defense struggle against aggression, and they must hand over their weapons to the dictatorial regime that the Americans have raised and supported, which serves as a tool for their new colonialist policy of aggression. Such peace is the peace of losing the country and losing freedom. The Vietnamese people will absolutely not accept such peace. The Vietnamese people are ready to endure all sacrifices at any time and will never give up independence and freedom. If the stubborn American imperialists do not give up their aggressive ambitions, the Vietnamese nation has sufficient strength to fight for five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer.

	The letter mentions the recent brilliant victories of the liberation armed forces in places such as Xining, Quang Tri, Da Nang, and Kon Tum, and calls on the people of Saigon to cooperate with these victories and further attack them in the enemy's largest stronghold. The letter also calls on the people of all classes in Saigon to concentrate their efforts to "defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression, thoroughly overthrow the puppet regime, and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral South Vietnam."

    阮友寿主席向西贡市人民发出号召
    团结起来打败美帝  推翻傀儡统治
    新华社河内二十一日电 据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，最近就“三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日十七周年写信给西贡市人民，号召他们进一步广泛团结起来，同全国人民一起，彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻西贡傀儡集团的反动统治。
    信中说，十七年来，西贡市人民继承和发扬了“三·一九”的精神，接连在敌人的巢穴里开展轰轰烈烈的斗争，取得了日益巨大的胜利。
    信中指出，美帝国主义虽然遭到了惨败，但是由于它的极其凶恶的本性，它仍然继续向南方增派军队和增加武器，以便把侵越战争扩大到空前规模。
    信中接着指出，美帝国主义在扩大战争的同时，不断玩弄“和谈”骗局，它的条件是：越南的北方必须放弃对正在遭受侵略的南方的骨肉同胞的帮助，南方人民必须放弃反对侵略的自卫战斗，并且把武器交给由美国豢养和扶植起来，并且作为它的新殖民主义侵略政策的工具的独裁制度。这样的和平，就是亡国和失去自由的和平。越南人民绝对不会接受这种和平。越南人民随时准备忍受一切牺牲，也绝对不愿意失去独立和自由。如果顽固的美帝国主义不肯放弃它的侵略野心，越南民族有充分的力量进行五年、十年、二十年或者更长时间的战斗。
    信中谈到解放武装力量最近接连在西宁、广治、岘港、昆嵩等地取得的辉煌胜利后号召西贡人民配合上述战功，进一步在敌人的最大巢穴里进攻它们。信中还号召，西贡市各阶层人民，集中力量“打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，彻底推翻傀儡集团的统治，建设一个独立、民主、和平、中立的越南南方。”
