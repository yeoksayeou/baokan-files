The proletarian revolutionary faction in a certain military supply factory in Shanghai, while implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production," has steadfastly used Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various non-proletarian ideologies. They have achieved a united front among revolutionary factions, correctly handled the relationship between revolution and production, paid attention to uniting revolutionary cadres, and created a vibrant scene of dual victories in revolution and production.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, this factory's proletarian revolutionary faction has grown stronger in the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. They have now formed a unified revolutionary organization across the entire factory, becoming the main force for both revolution and production. They have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," with revolutionary spirit and boundless enthusiasm. Since February, production has steadily increased, and the quality and quantity of major products have fully exceeded the planned targets. They have also solved several long-standing technical production problems.

In implementing the great directive to "grasp revolution, promote production," the revolutionary faction in this factory has repeatedly studied and discussed within the faction how to properly handle the relationship between revolution and production. This has raised everyone's awareness and determined that they must both carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and promote production. Previously, some people focused solely on production and paid less attention to revolution, while others focused only on revolution and neglected production. The revolutionary faction promptly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's writings on class and class struggle, as well as the brilliant works such as "On the Army's Self-Sufficiency in Production and the Importance of the Two Movements of Rectification and Production." This helped everyone understand that revolution is the lifeline. Carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that our socialist iron fortress remains unshakable. This is a matter of great importance for the long term. However, while focusing on revolution, production must also be well-managed. Otherwise, it will affect preparedness for war, support for world revolution, and the successful progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the process of grasping revolution and promoting production, the revolutionary faction also paid great attention to implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and overcoming incorrect tendencies in handling cadre issues. There were different opinions among the masses on how to correctly handle cadres. Some people did not fully understand the severity of class struggle and had rightist tendencies. Others had the attitude of rejecting and overthrowing everything. In response to this situation, the revolutionary faction organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's writings on cadre policy, educating everyone to conduct class analysis of cadres and treat them differently. They united those cadres who, despite their mistakes, were willing to correct them and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, allowing these cadres to work together with the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teachings, wholeheartedly united with all revolutionary cadres and those who had made mistakes but were willing to correct them. They mobilized the enthusiasm of the cadres. The deputy director of the third workshop, for example, last winter participated in the revolution with the workers and seriously arranged production, setting a good example in both revolution and production. The deputy director in charge of production also remained at his post. The revolutionary faction often provided working conditions for revolutionary cadres and valued their opinions. Due to the correct handling of cadre issues, cadres played an active role in both revolution and production.

    上海某军需工厂正确处理革命和生产关系正确对待干部
    革命步步深入　生产节节上升
    二月以来产品质量和主要产品产量超额完成计划
    据新华社上海十五日电　上海某军需工厂无产阶级革命派，在贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的过程中，坚持用毛泽东思想战胜形形色色的非无产阶级思想，实行革命派大联合，正确处理革命和生产的关系，注意团结革命干部，出现革命生产双胜利的生气勃勃的景象。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中发展壮大起来，现在已组成全厂统一的革命组织，成为革命和生产的主力军。他们坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，革命精神焕发，干劲冲天，二月份以来，生产稳步上升，产品质量和主要产品的产量全面超额完成计划，并且解决了多年以来没有解决的一些生产技术上的老大难问题。
    这个厂的革命派，在贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，就如何处理好革命和生产两者的关系，在革命派内部反复进行学习和研究，提高了大家的认识，决心既要搞好无产阶级文化大革命，又要搞好生产。前些时候，有的人埋头搞生产，对搞革命不太重视；有的人又光顾抓革命，不重视抓生产。革命派及时组织大家学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，学习《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》等光辉著作，使大家认识到抓革命是命根子，搞好无产阶级文化大革命，就能巩固无产阶级专政，保证我们社会主义铁打江山永不变色，这是千年大计，万年大计，是头等重要的大事。但是在抓好革命的同时，一定要搞好生产，搞好工作。否则，就要影响战备，影响支援世界革命，也影响无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行。
    在抓革命，促生产的过程中，革命派还十分重视贯彻毛主席的干部政策，克服在处理干部问题上的错误倾向。怎样正确对待干部，当时在群众中有不同的看法。有些人对阶级斗争严重性认识不足，存在着右倾情绪。另有一些人，有排斥一切、打倒一切的情绪。针对这种情况，革命派组织帮助大家反复学习毛主席有关干部政策的论述，教育大家对干部必须进行阶级分析，区别对待，团结那些虽有错误但愿意改正、愿意回到毛主席革命路线一边的干部，使这些干部和革命群众一道革命，一起工作。革命群众按照毛主席的教导，满腔热忱地团结一切革命的干部和虽犯过错误但愿意改正的干部，调动干部的积极性。三车间副主任去年冬天就和工人一起闹革命，认真安排生产，在革命和生产两方面都作出了好样子。管生产的副厂长也一直留在原岗位工作。革命派还经常注意为革命干部提供工作条件，重视他们的意见。由于正确对待干部问题，使干部在革命和生产中都起到了积极的作用。
