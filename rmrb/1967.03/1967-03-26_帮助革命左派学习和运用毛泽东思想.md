The People's Liberation Army's support unit in Sichuan's Duku Port has created good experiences in politically supporting the leftists and helping revolutionary leftists study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. By working together with the revolutionary leftists to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, they grasp the living thoughts, correctly understand the party's policies, and nurture the revolutionary leftists under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. This helps the leftists grow stronger and rely on their own strength to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A report from Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on March 25 states that the support unit of the People's Liberation Army in Sichuan's Duku Port firmly supports the proletarian revolutionaries politically. They actively help the revolutionary leftists study and apply Chairman Mao's works, guiding the revolutionary leftists under the great Mao Zedong Thought to rely on their own strength to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This creates good experiences for the People's Liberation Army to further support the proletarian revolutionaries.

The military in Duku Port enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the leftists. They immediately formed a support unit to aid the proletarian revolutionaries in achieving great unity and seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. The military's strong support has made the revolutionary leftists jubilant and full of fighting spirit. The broad revolutionary leftists have unlimited trust in the People's Liberation Army, which was personally created and nurtured by the great leader Chairman Mao. Many revolutionary mass organizations seek the army's "instructions and reports." Some organizations, when they have disagreements, ask the army to act as their "judge." Some even hope for victory in the struggle by relying on the army's "stance." In such circumstances, if the army does not pay attention, it is easy to fall into the trap of doing things for them. To better complete the task of supporting the revolutionary leftists, the support unit, in response to this situation, organized the soldiers to study and discuss Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and the "Sixteen Points" on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through studying, the soldiers realized that implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means firmly believing in the masses, fully mobilizing the masses, and letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves in the struggle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul of every individual. Therefore, supporting the revolutionary leftists mainly means arming the broad leftist masses with Mao Zedong Thought, helping the revolutionary leftists study and apply Chairman Mao's works; it means doing a good job in political and ideological work, relying on the masses' own strength to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After more than a month of practice, they have gained the following insights into politically supporting the proletarian revolutionaries:

First, enthusiastically help the proletarian revolutionary leftists study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Learn and apply in the struggle, using Chairman Mao's teachings to seek strategies and methods for the struggle. This turns the sharp and complex class struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party into a large classroom for spreading Mao Zedong Thought. In this great class struggle, intense debates and a few people causing trouble are inevitable and are good things. Such storms and waves are the conditions for producing and tempering true revolutionary leftists. As long as Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon, is timely sent to the masses, and they are organized to study Chairman Mao's works and relevant quotations to solve various problems they raise, any complex and confusing issues will be easily resolved. Revolutionary masses taste the sweetness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, further deepening their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao's works. Only the masses organized with Mao Zedong Thought are true revolutionary leftists and the decisive force for winning the power struggle. This is the key to supporting the revolutionary leftists in seizing power and also the key to supporting them in taking power.

Second, help the proletarian revolutionary leftists grasp the living thoughts, do a good job in uniting and educating the internal members, and make the revolutionary mass organizations into strong, combat-ready collectives based on ideological unity. Most leaders of revolutionary mass organizations were originally ordinary workers and lacked experience in grasping living thoughts and doing ideological work for the people. The comrades in the support unit helped them study Chairman Mao's teachings on "mastering ideological education, which is the key link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles" to raise their awareness of strengthening political and ideological work; and helped them summarize their experiences and lessons in overcoming organizational dispersion and strengthening internal unity in the fierce class struggle. With the strong support of the support unit, some leftist organizations have already paid attention to this link, able to grasp the living thoughts within the organization according to the development of the struggle situation, and strengthen political and ideological work. They are not crushed or overwhelmed even when they are in the minority or when the rightists create white terror. They are growing stronger in the fierce and sharp class struggle.

Third, help the proletarian revolutionary leftists follow Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, always maintain a clear mind, and adhere to the correct direction of the struggle. The support unit timely conveys the new situations and experiences from across the country and the spirit of the central policies to the revolutionary leftists, discussing and learning with them, clarifying their confused ideas. This makes them more conscious in their actions, elevating various complex issues to the level of the struggle between the two lines. In the struggle, they are not provoked by individual incidents, and when they make mistakes, they can correct them in time, unifying the revolutionary rebel spirit with the party's policy consciousness.

### 帮助革命左派学习和运用毛泽东思想

    四川渡口驻军从政治思想上支持左派创造了很好的经验
    帮助革命左派学习和运用毛泽东思想
    同革命左派一起在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，抓好活思想，正确掌握党的方针政策，使革命左派在毛泽东思想的哺育下，成长壮大，依靠自己的力量，搞好无产阶级文化大革命。
    新华社成都二十五日电　中国人民解放军驻四川渡口地区某部支左联合指挥部，坚持从政治思想上支持无产阶级革命派，积极帮助革命左派活学活用毛主席著作，使革命左派在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，依靠自己的力量，搞好无产阶级文化大革命，为人民解放军进一步做好支持无产阶级革命派的工作，创造了很好的经验。
    渡口驻军热烈响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，立即组成支左联合指挥部，支援无产阶级革命派实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争。解放军的大力支援，使革命左派欢欣鼓舞，斗志昂扬。广大革命左派对伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和培养的人民解放军无限信任，许多革命群众组织纷纷找部队“请示报告”，有些组织之间发生了争辩，还要部队充当他们的“裁判人”，有的把斗争的胜利寄托在部队的“表态”上。在这种情况下，部队如果不加以注意，就很容易产生包办代替现象。为了把支援革命左派的任务完成得更好，支左联合指挥部针对这一情况，专门组织指战员们学习和讨论了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》以及无产阶级文化大革命的十六条等文件。指战员们通过学习认识到，贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要坚定地相信群众，充分地发动群众，放手让群众在斗争中自己教育自己，自己解放自己。无产阶级文化大革命是触及每个人灵魂的大革命。因此，支持革命左派，最主要的就是要用毛泽东思想去武装左派广大群众，帮助革命左派活学活用毛主席著作；就是要坚持做好政治思想工作，依靠群众自己的力量，搞好无产阶级文化大革命。
    经过这一个多月的实践，他们对从政治思想上支持无产阶级革命派取得了这样几点体会：
    第一，热情地帮助无产阶级革命左派活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，用毛主席的教导去寻求斗争的策略和方法，使无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权这场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，真正变成普及毛泽东思想的大课堂。在这场阶级大搏斗中，激烈的争辩和少数人出来捣乱，是必然的现象，也是好事情。这种大风大浪，正是产生和锻炼真正革命左派的条件。只要及时地给群众送去毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，针对他们提出要解决的各种问题，组织他们学习毛主席著作和有关语录，启发他们开动机器，任何复杂纷纭的问题，都会迎刃而解。革命群众在斗争中尝到活学活用毛主席著作的甜头，也就进一步加深了对毛主席著作的无产阶级感情。这样用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众组织，才是真正的革命左派，才是取得夺权斗争胜利的决定力量。这一点，既是支援革命左派夺权的关键，也是支援革命左派掌权的关键。
    第二，帮助无产阶级革命左派抓好活思想，做好团结教育内部的工作，使革命群众组织成为在思想统一的基础上有战斗力的坚强集体。多数革命群众组织的负责人，原来都是普通工人，对抓好活思想，做好人的思想工作缺乏经验。支左联合指挥部的同志帮助他们学习了毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，提高他们对加强政治思想工作的认识；并帮助他们总结自己在激烈的阶级斗争中克服组织涣散状态、加强内部团结的经验教训。在支左联合指挥部的大力帮助下，有些左派组织已经重视这一环节，能够根据斗争形势的发展，大抓内部的活思想，加强政治思想工作。他们在暂时处于少数，甚至右派制造白色恐怖的情况下，轰不垮，压不倒，正在激烈尖锐的阶级斗争中不断发展壮大起来。
    第三，帮助无产阶级革命左派紧跟毛主席、紧跟以毛主席为首的党中央，始终保持清醒的头脑，坚持斗争的大方向。支左联合指挥部及时把全国的新形势、新经验和中央的政策精神，传达给革命左派，和他们同学共议，澄清他们的糊涂认识。这样，就使他们在行动上更加自觉，把千头万绪的问题上升到两条路线斗争的纲上来，在斗争中，不被个别事件所激怒，有了错误，能够及时纠正，把革命造反精神和党的政策观念统一起来。
