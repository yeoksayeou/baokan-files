The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, are seizing the revolution and promoting production. The spring ploughing production situation in Guizhou is getting better and better. Rural community members are actively engaged in accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, ploughing the land, and preparing the fields. In areas where the season is relatively early, sowing and seedling cultivation have already begun. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" production leadership teams that have been established are helping the grassroots solve various problems in spring ploughing, thus promoting spring ploughing production. Most of the production brigades and teams in the province have implemented this year's production plan.

The New China News Agency, Guiyang, March 29 - The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the mountainous areas of Guizhou are resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, they are vigorously seizing the revolution and vigorously promoting production. Currently, the spring ploughing production situation is very good and is getting better and better.

Now, from the eastern foothills of the Miao Mountains to the western Umon Mountains, from the southern Panjiang Valley to the northern banks of the Wujiang River, the various ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres who hold the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their hands are following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not missing the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." They have launched a high tide of spring ploughing production. All over the province, the countryside is bustling with the lively scene of spring ploughing. The community members, according to the requirements of striving for a bumper harvest, first concentrate their labor, making use of the abundant fertilizer sources in the mountains, to cut grass and pick young leaves, accumulate and pile up fertilizer and ash fertilizer. Some teams lead cattle up the mountains to accumulate a large amount of high-quality manure on the spot. In the main peak area of the Miao Mountains, Leigong Mountain, 40% of the labor force in Leishan County is busy accumulating and transporting fertilizer. Small-scale water conservancy projects such as mountain gullies, irrigation ditches, mountain ponds, and reservoirs, which are suitable for the needs of drought resistance and flood control in mountainous areas, are being constructed urgently if they can benefit this year. In the upper reaches of the Wujiang River, Meitan County mobilized more than 11,000 people in early March to repair 960 medium and small water conservancy projects. Ploughing the land, preparing seeds, repairing agricultural tools, and fattening draft cattle and teaching young cattle to plough the fields are also being actively carried out. Recently, some parts of Guizhou have had timely rains, and the community members and cadres of many production teams have worked through the night in the rain to plough the fields. In the relatively early season of Pingba and river valley areas, early spring crops such as early corn, spring oats, and potatoes, as well as seedlings of rice, tobacco, and sweet potatoes, have already begun to be sown and cultivated.

"Seizing the revolution and promoting production" is the consistent strategic thinking of the great leader Chairman Mao. The current good situation of spring ploughing production in the mountainous areas of Guizhou is precisely the inevitable result of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the sky-high enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and applying it to spring ploughing production.

After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," more than 4,000 rural people's communes in the province held three-level cadre meetings in late February and early March, and the production teams held community member meetings. Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" spread throughout the villages and hamlets of Guizhou, basically achieving household knowledge, greatly mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres. The poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee said that we are the main force for seizing the revolution and promoting production in the countryside, which makes us full of energy. We are determined to do a better job of revolution and production. Revolutionary cadres also expressed that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have such trust in us, and we must not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's expectations. Some cadres who had made mistakes in the past were also able to accept criticism from the masses, actively examine their mistakes, and boldly take the lead in production, striving to make amends in spring ploughing production.

The broad masses of community members and cadres are resolutely following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "seize the revolution and promote production," putting revolution in the first place, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, using Mao Zedong Thought to direct the spring ploughing battle, and on the basis of promoting the thought revolutionization of the people, further improving spring ploughing production.

Establishing revolutionary "three-in-one combination" production leadership teams at all levels is the political and organizational guarantee for Guizhou's spring ploughing production to be both lively and solid this year.

When organizing production leadership teams consisting of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army (community representatives are militia representatives), the emphasis is on truly implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, opposing conciliation, compromise, merging into one, and forcing numbers. This makes the production leadership team truly become a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian vanguard to seize the revolution and promote production on the front line.

After the establishment of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" production leadership teams at all levels, military cadres or militia representatives have brought the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, such as emphasizing politics, the "four firsts," and the "three-eighths style," into the leadership structure, promoting the revolutionization of the production leadership teams at all levels. The members of the leadership team, with the spirit of "seizing the day" and swift action, quickly went to the grassroots and to the masses, discovering and solving problems on the spring ploughing front. According to incomplete statistics in mid-March, after the establishment of the production leadership teams at the prefecture (autonomous prefecture) and county levels, more than 5,500 cadres were dispatched to work on the spring ploughing production front line. Longli County dispatched more than 140 cadres, who went to the communes and production teams to vigorously publicize Mao Zedong Thought, implement the party's policies, and help the grassroots solve various problems in spring ploughing production, thus promoting local spring ploughing production.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history." The numerous facts in Guizhou's spring ploughing this year prove that as long as democracy is truly carried out, the masses not only dare to be masters of their own house but also know how to be masters of their own house. For example, in implementing production plans and increasing production measures, each county this year generally adopts a combination of top-down and bottom-up methods. First, the county's production leadership team proposes a rough draft of this year's agricultural production, and then mobilizes the masses to democratically discuss and formulate the agricultural production plans for their own commune and production team based on reality. When formulating the plan, the spirit of "considering the overall situation, adapting to local conditions, being active and reliable, and leaving room for maneuver" was implemented, which fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses. Now, most of the people's communes and production teams in the province have, through holding three-level cadre meetings and community member meetings, discussed and implemented this year's production plan. According to a survey in Zhenyuan County, the planned production of communes and teams is mostly slightly higher than the actual yield of the relatively good harvest last year.

The current spring ploughing production situation in the mountainous areas of Guizhou is excellent. However, the broad revolutionary masses and grassroots cadres, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching: "Whoever only sees the bright side and not the difficulties will not be able to fight well for the realization of the party's tasks," are conducting a comprehensive inspection of various work related to spring ploughing production, discovering weak links, strengthening leadership in a timely manner, solving specific problems in a timely manner, and summarizing experiences in a timely manner to further launch a new high tide of spring ploughing production.

    广大贫下中农和革命干部以毛泽东思想为统帅抓革命促生产
    贵州春耕生产形势越来越好
    农村社员积极投入积肥、运肥、修水利、翻地、犁田等备耕工作，季节较早的地区已开始播种和育秧。已建立的革命的“三结合”生产领导班子的成员，切实帮助基层解决春耕中的各种问题，促进了春耕生产。全省大多数社队落实了今年的生产计划。
    新华社贵阳二十九日电　贵州山区广大农村的贫下中农和革命干部，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为统帅，狠抓革命，猛促生产，目前春耕生产的形势好得很，而且越来越好。
    现在，贵州东起苗岭山麓，西到乌蒙山区，南自盘江河谷，北抵乌江两岸，掌握着无产阶级文化大革命命运的各族贫下中农和革命干部，遵循毛主席“不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩”的教导，掀起了春耕生产的高潮。全省各地农村到处是热气腾腾闹春耕的动人景象。社员们按照争取大丰收的要求，首先集中劳力，利用山区丰富的肥源，铲山草割嫩叶，积制堆肥、灰肥，有的队牵牛上山，就地积制了大量优质粪肥。苗岭山脉的主峰雷公山下的雷山县，有百分之四十的劳动力都在忙着积肥、运肥。适应山区抗旱排洪需要的拦山沟、引水渠、山塘、水库等小型水利工程，凡是能在今年受益的，都在加紧施工。乌江支流上的湄潭县，三月上旬出动一万一千多人，对九百六十多处中小型水利工程进行了维修。翻地、准备种子、修理农具以及给耕牛催膘、教小牛犁田等春耕准备工作，也在积极进行中。最近贵州部分地区喜雨，不少生产队的社员和干部连夜冒雨上坡，抢水犁田。季节较早的平坝、河谷地区，已开始播种早玉米、春荞麦、马铃薯等早春作物，和培育水稻、烟叶、甘薯的秧苗。
      “抓革命，促生产”，是伟大领袖毛主席一贯的战略思想。贵州山区当前春耕生产的大好形势，正是广大贫下中农和革命干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到春耕生产上去的必然结果。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表以后，全省四千多个农村人民公社在二月底三月初，普遍召开了三级干部会议，生产队也召开了社员大会。毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，传遍了贵州山区村村寨寨，基本上做到了家喻户晓，极大地调动了广大贫下中农和基层干部的革命积极性。贫下中农激动地说：毛主席和党中央说我们是农村抓革命、促生产的主力军，使我们真是浑身是劲，我们决心要把革命和生产搞得好上加好。广大革命干部也表示，毛主席和党中央这样相信我们，我们要决不辜负毛主席和党中央的期望。一些过去犯过错误的干部，也能一面接受群众批评，主动检查自己的错误，一面大胆起来领导生产，争取在春耕生产中将功补过。
    广大社员群众和干部，正是这样坚决地遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，把革命摆到第一位，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，用毛泽东思想来指挥春耕战斗，在促进人的思想革命化的基础上，进一步搞好春耕生产。
    建立各级革命的“三结合”的生产领导班子，是贵州今年春耕生产搞得既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的政治和组织保证。
    各地在组织有革命群众组织代表、革命领导干部、人民解放军当地驻军代表（公社是民兵代表）的生产领导班子的时候，强调必须实行真正的革命的“三结合”，贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，反对搞调和、折中、合二而一、勉强凑数。这样就使生产领导班子真正成为一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。
    各级革命的“三结合”生产领导班子建立后，军队干部或民兵代表都把人民解放军突出政治、“四个第一”、“三八作风”等优良传统带进了领导机构，促进了各级生产领导班子的革命化。领导班子的成员以“只争朝夕”的精神和雷厉风行的作风，迅速到基层去，到群众中去，在春耕现场发现问题和解决问题。据三月中旬的不完全统计，仅专区（自治州）和县两级生产领导班子成立后，就抽调了五千五百多名干部到春耕生产第一线工作。龙里县抽调一百四十多名干部，分头到公社和生产队后，大力宣传毛泽东思想，贯彻党的方针政策，切实帮助基层解决春耕生产中的各种问题，促进了当地的春耕生产。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”贵州今年春耕中的无数事实证明，只要真正发扬了民主，群众不但敢于当家作主，而且善于当家作主。例如，在落实生产计划和增产措施方面，今年各县普遍采取自上而下与自下而上相结合的办法，先由县的生产领导班子提出今年农业生产的轮廓草案，放手发动群众民主讨论，从实际出发制订本公社、本生产队的农业生产计划。在制订计划时，贯彻了“顾全大局，因地制宜，积极可靠，留有余地”的精神，这就充分地调动了群众的积极性。现在全省大多数人民公社、生产队，已通过召开三级干部会和社员大会，讨论落实了今年的生产计划。据镇远县调查，社、队的计划产量大部分略高于收成较好的去年的实收数字。
    贵州山区当前春耕生产形势是大好的。但是，广大革命群众和基层干部，牢记毛主席的教导：“谁要是只看见光明一面，不看见困难一面，谁就会不能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”他们正在对当前有关春耕生产的各项工作普遍进行一次检查，发现薄弱环节，及时加强领导，及时解决具体问题，及时总结经验，以进一步掀起春耕生产的新高潮。
