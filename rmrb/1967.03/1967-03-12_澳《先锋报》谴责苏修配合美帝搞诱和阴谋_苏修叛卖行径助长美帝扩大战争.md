	The Australian *Vanguard* published an editorial on March 9, once again condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism in an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to abandon their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	The editorial pointed out that the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist clique have emboldened U.S. imperialism to further escalate its war of aggression.

	The editorial continued, "Kosygin and Soviet newspapers have shamelessly demanded that the Vietnamese people make concessions, but this has not satisfied U.S. imperialism, which still wants more."

	The editorial pointed out that as long as U.S. imperialism does not get what it wants, it will intensify the war and further expand it.

	The editorial pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have paved the way for U.S. imperialism's aggression. The editorial also exposed the hypocritical call for "united action" made by the Soviet revisionist leadership. The editorial pointed out that since the call for "united action" comes from the Soviet revisionists, this action can only serve their needs, that is, to collaborate with U.S. imperialism in their "bombing halt and attrition war" conspiracy. In other words, it is a direct betrayal of the Vietnamese people and a guarantee of U.S. imperialism's occupation of Vietnam.

    澳《先锋报》谴责苏修配合美帝搞诱和阴谋
    苏修叛卖行径助长美帝扩大战争
    新华社墨尔本九日电　澳大利亚《先锋报》九日发表社论，再次谴责苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义勾结，企图迫使越南人民放弃抗美救国斗争的叛卖行径。
    社论指出，苏修集团的叛卖行为，助长了美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略战争。
    社论接着说，柯西金和苏联报纸硬要越南人民作出让步的卑鄙言论，未能使美帝国主义满意，美帝国主义还要更多的东西。
    社论指出，在美帝国主义没有得到更多的东西的时候，它就加紧战争升级，进一步扩大战争。
    社论指出，苏联修正主义者为美帝国主义的侵略铺平了道路。社论还揭露了苏联修正主义领导集团伪善地提出的所谓“联合行动”的号召。社论指出，由于提出所谓“联合行动”的是苏联修正主义者，所以这个行动只能是符合他们的需要，即配合美帝国主义搞“停炸诱和”的阴谋。换言之，就是直接出卖越南人民和保证美帝国主义占领越南。
