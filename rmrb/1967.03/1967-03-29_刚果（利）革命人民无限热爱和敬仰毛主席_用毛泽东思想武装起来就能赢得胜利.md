The revolutionary people of Congo (Leopoldville) deeply love and admire Chairman Mao. They praise Chairman Mao as the greatest teacher of the revolutionary people of the world today.

According to people coming from Leopoldville, in Congo (Leopoldville) under the rule of imperialists and puppet regimes, the working people in the capital and other cities talk about the great name of "Mao Zedong" with boundless admiration. They place their hopes in Chairman Mao, just as one hopes for the sun in the darkness. Especially the revolutionary people living and fighting in the guerrilla zones of the patriotic armed forces admire Chairman Mao even more.

Under the white terror in Congo (Leopoldville), it is extremely difficult for those who admire Chairman Mao to obtain a Mao Zedong badge, a photo of Chairman Mao, a book by Chairman Mao, or a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." However, whenever they obtain one of these, it brings them the greatest happiness and joy. A foreign visitor once saw a Congolese (Leopoldville) youth wearing a Mao Zedong badge on the street. The youth told him, "I am not afraid of danger. I truly love and respect Mao Zedong. He is the greatest leader of the revolutionary people of the world." If a visitor to Congo (Leopoldville) is wearing a Mao Zedong badge, progressive Congolese (Leopoldville) friends will immediately surround him to ask for the badge. Many Congolese (Leopoldville) people, once they obtain a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," will widely circulate it. Many people can recite Chairman Mao's famous quotations and the most inspiring sentences from Chairman Mao's statement supporting the Congolese (Leopoldville) people's struggle against American imperialism. Some people even row small boats to neighboring countries to seek a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and works by Chairman Mao.

In early January of this year, at a grand mass rally held in the capital of Congo (Leopoldville), Leopoldville, someone mentioned in a speech a famous saying of Chairman Mao: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." This sentence immediately received enthusiastic applause and cheers. The attendees shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Many Congolese (Leopoldville) youths gather in the evenings to listen to broadcasts from Beijing Radio. These youths are particularly interested in news about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

A progressive professor from Congo (Leopoldville) once told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "When I heard that Chairman Mao is in good health, I was so happy that I shed tears. Chairman Mao's good health is a great source of our happiness." He said, "Today, our people increasingly understand that only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve thorough national liberation."

    刚果（利）革命人民无限热爱和敬仰毛主席
    用毛泽东思想武装起来就能赢得胜利
    新华社布拉柴维尔电　刚果（利）革命人民热爱伟大的毛泽东主席，赞扬毛主席是当代世界革命人民的最伟大的导师。
    据从利奥波德维尔来的人们说，在处于帝国主义者和傀儡政权统治下的刚果（利），首都和其他城市的劳动人民怀着无限敬仰的心情，谈论“毛泽东”这个伟大的名字。他们把希望寄托于毛主席，象在黑暗中希望太阳一样。特别是生活和战斗在爱国武装力量的游击区的革命人民更是对毛主席十分敬仰。
    在刚果（利）白色恐怖统治下，敬仰毛主席的人们要想得到一枚毛主席像章、一张毛主席照片、一本毛主席著作或一本《毛主席语录》是非常困难的，但是每当他们从什么地方得到了其中的一种，那就是最大的幸福和快乐。一位外国访问者曾在大街上见到一名刚果（利）青年身上戴着一枚毛主席像章。这个青年对他说：“我不怕危险。我真心热爱和尊敬毛泽东，他是世界革命人民最伟大的领袖”。如果去刚果（利）访问的人身上佩着毛主席像章，立即会被进步的刚果（利）朋友围住，要走像章。许多刚果（利）人一旦得到《毛主席语录》，就广泛地传阅。不少人能背诵毛主席的著名语录和毛主席支持刚果（利）人民反对美帝国主义的声明里最激动人心的句子。有人甚至还划着小木船到邻国去寻求一本《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作。
    今年一月中旬在刚果（利）首都利奥波德维尔举行的一次盛大的群众集会上，有人在发言中提到了毛主席的一句名言：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这句话立即博得了热烈的掌声和欢呼声，到会的群众高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    不少刚果（利）青年晚上聚集在一起，收听北京电台的广播。这些青年对有关中国无产阶级文化大革命的消息特别感兴趣。
    来自刚果（利）的一位进步教授曾对新华社记者说：“当我听说毛主席身体很健康的时候，我高兴得流下了眼泪。毛主席身体健康是我们幸福的巨大源泉。”他说：“今天我国人民越来越懂得，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，我们才能赢得彻底的民族解放。”
