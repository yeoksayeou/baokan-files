Recently, the head of Japan's reactionary government, Sato, openly boasted in a meeting with reporters in Iwakuni City that he would continue to "maintain the current security arrangements," claiming that the U.S. military bases in Japan cannot be withdrawn, otherwise "in case of an emergency, it would be too late." He even hysterically shouted: "To truly ensure Japan's security, our country must pay the price."

Sato's outburst once again exposed the shameless treachery of Japan's reactionaries, their collusion with U.S. imperialism, and their sinister plot to revive Japanese militarism and impose war on the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia.

Who is threatening Japan's security? Let us look at the facts.

Currently, U.S. military bases are scattered all over Japan, and U.S. imperialist invasion forces are stationed everywhere. U.S. nuclear submarines frequently enter Japanese ports, and U.S. aircraft carrying nuclear weapons fly freely in Japanese airspace. This is what the reactionaries and the U.S. call "security" under the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

Everyone knows that U.S. forces in Japan are rampant and unruly. They brazenly conduct military exercises, even using Japanese people as live targets. They arbitrarily seize land, set up military bases with barbed wire, demolish Japanese people's houses, destroy farmers' fields and crops, causing many Japanese people to become homeless and destitute, with their lives and property unprotected.

Now, U.S. imperialist warships frequently sail from Japanese bases to Vietnam. U.S. personnel, ammunition, weapons, and supplies are continuously transported from Japanese bases to South Vietnam to massacre the Vietnamese people. U.S. B-52 bombers also take off from U.S. bases in Japan to conduct indiscriminate bombing in South Vietnam. Today, Japan has actually become a nuclear war base for U.S. imperialism.

These facts clearly show: the threat to Japan's security is not from others, but from the U.S. bandits who claim to "protect" Japan.

U.S. imperialism not only uses Japan as a military base to invade China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, but is also actively fostering Japanese militarist forces to carry out its scheme of "using Asians to fight Asians." This ties the fate of the Japanese people to the U.S. war chariot. Now, Sato's so-called "ensuring Japan's security, our country must pay the price" is to further sell out to U.S. imperialism under the pretext of "ensuring Japan's security," further betray the national interests of Japan, and drag the Japanese people back into the abyss of disaster. Isn't this crystal clear?

"Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution." The Japanese people will never forget that it was U.S. imperialism that dropped the world's first atomic bomb on Japanese territory, and it is U.S. imperialism that is trampling on Japanese soil, violating Japan's independence and sovereignty. In the struggle, the Japanese people are increasingly recognizing that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Where oppression is the greatest, resistance is the strongest. The Japanese people have suffered greatly from the bullying of U.S. imperialism and the oppression of the Japanese reactionaries, and they have bravely risen up in resistance. In recent years, the Japanese people have held massive anti-U.S. demonstrations and launched a powerful anti-U.S. struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." We believe that the brave Japanese people, with their tradition of struggle, will surely foil the war plots and invasion plans of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, and will surely take the fate of the Japanese nation firmly into their own hands.

We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We firmly stand with the Japanese people and fight together to drive our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, out of Japan and out of the entire Asia! Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology

    佐藤正在走东条的老路
    最近，日本反动政府头目佐藤在岩国市接见记者时，公然叫嚣要继续“维持现行安全保障体制”，说什么不能撤销美国在日本的军事基地，否则“一旦发生事的时候就来不及了”。他甚至歇斯底里地狂叫：“为了真正保证日本的安全，我国必须付出代价。”
    佐藤这次叫嚷，又一次暴露了日本反动派无耻卖国，勾结美帝的狰狞面目，和它加速复活日本军国主义，企图把战争强加在日本人民和亚洲人民头上的险恶阴谋。
    到底是谁在威胁日本的安全？让我们来看一看事实。
    现在，日本领土上到处布满美国的军事基地，到处驻扎着美帝国主义的侵略军队，美国核潜艇一次又一次地闯进日本的港口，美国带核武器的飞机在日本领空通行无阻地飞来飞去，这就是日本反动派与美国签订“日美安全条约”的所谓“安全”。
    谁都知道，美国军队在日本横冲直撞，胡作非为。他们肆无忌惮地进行军事演习，甚至把日本人民当作活靶子来打。他们随便圈地拉铁丝网设立军事基地，拆毁日本人民的房屋，毁坏农民的耕地和庄稼，使许多日本人流离失所，无家可归，生命财产毫无保障。
    现在，美帝国主义的侵略军舰经常从日本基地开往越南。美国的兵员、弹药、武器以及部队给养源源不断从日本基地运到南越，去屠杀越南人民。美国Ｂ—52轰炸机，也有从日本的美国基地起飞，到南越去进行狂轰滥炸。今天，日本实际上已经成为美帝国主义的一个核战争基地。
    这些事实，不正清楚地说明：威胁日本安全的不是别人，正是自称“保护”日本的美国强盗吗？
    美帝国主义不仅把日本作为侵略中国、越南和亚洲其他国家的军事基地，而且正加紧扶植日本军国主义势力，以便推行它“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的诡计，从而把日本民族的命运拴在美国的侵略战车上。现在佐藤叫嚷的所谓“保证日本的安全，我国必须付出代价”，就是要在所谓“保证日本安全”的借口下，更进一步地卖身投靠美帝国主义，更进一步地出卖日本的民族利益，并且把日本人民再一次拖向灾难的深渊，这不是一清二楚的吗？
      “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”日本人民永远不会忘记，正是美帝国主义在日本领土上投下了世界上第一颗原子弹，也正是美帝蹂躏着日本的国土，侵犯着日本的独立和主权。日本人民在斗争中越来越认清了美帝国主义是日本人民最凶恶的敌人。
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。哪里压迫最甚，哪里反抗也就最烈。日本人民饱受了美帝国主义的欺凌和日本反动派的压迫，他们勇敢地起来反抗了。近几年来，日本人民一次又一次举行规模巨大的反美示威游行，展开了声势浩大的反美斗争。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”我们相信，富有斗争传统的英勇的日本人民一定能够挫败美帝国主义和本国反动派的战争阴谋和侵略计划，一定能够把日本民族的命运牢牢地掌握在自己的手中。
    我们是毛主席的红卫兵，我们坚决地和日本人民站在一起，共同战斗，把我们共同的敌人美帝国主义从日本赶出去，从整个亚洲赶出去！北京矿业学院
