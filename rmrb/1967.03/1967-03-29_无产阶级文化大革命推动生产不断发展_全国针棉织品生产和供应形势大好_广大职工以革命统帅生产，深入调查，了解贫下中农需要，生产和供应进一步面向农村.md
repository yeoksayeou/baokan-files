Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the production and supply of knitted and cotton fabrics across the country are in a very good situation. According to materials provided at a recent meeting held in Shanghai by the commercial department, the production of knitted and cotton fabrics nationwide this year will see a significant increase. The supply of daily necessities such as underwear, socks, bedsheets, and towels to the market will be much greater than last year. This year, whether in terms of production volume or supply volume, will be the highest in recent years.

The splendid revolutionary situation has brought about a thriving production situation. Last year, China's cotton harvest was bountiful, providing ample raw materials for the increased production of knitted and cotton fabrics. Not only has production in old industrial bases further developed, but some regions that previously had lower production have also expanded production this year, increasing the self-sufficiency rate of knitted and cotton fabrics. In the first and second months of this year, while accelerating the production of winter items such as sanitary clothing, cotton sweaters, scarves, and gloves, the production of summer items such as undershirts, singlets, and light-colored socks has also begun in advance. Large quantities of knitted and cotton fabrics are being shipped from cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to various places. By the end of March 20th this year, Shanghai had shipped out over 8,000 tons of knitted and cotton fabrics, with many items already completing their first-quarter allocation tasks and starting to allocate goods for the second quarter. Due to the development of production, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Beijing, and other places also have some commodities that are being shipped out in large quantities this year. Currently, department stores in cities and towns across the country and supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas have a full range of knitted and cotton fabrics and ample supplies.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary cadres of China's knitted and cotton fabric production system have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, united with the broad revolutionary workers and cadres, exposed and fought against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, criticized the capitalist reactionary line, implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and led production with revolution, driving production to a new stage. Shanghai Knitting Factory No. 6, which specializes in the production of underwear, seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party during the great "January Revolution" storm and continued to advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. While focusing on the revolution, they united all possible forces to launch a new production high tide. In February, the factory overfulfilled the state plan, not only making up for the production shortfall in January due to the counter-revolutionary economism of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party but also producing a large quantity of cotton sweaters, singlets, and other market-needed items. In March, production continued to rise month by month. Shanghai Towel Factory No. 3's revolutionary cadres adhere to the eight-hour workday system, producing during work hours and revolting during off-hours, with the revolution in full swing and production thriving. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has overfulfilled the state plan every month, with the current pass rate of towels and pillowcases reaching over 99%.

This year, China's production and supply of knitted and cotton fabrics have further focused on rural areas, which is a distinctive feature of leading production with revolution. Revolutionary cadres of commercial departments across the country have learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Peasants—this is the main body of the industrial market in China. Only they can provide the most abundant grain and raw materials and absorb the largest quantity of industrial products." They have clarified their service direction, with deep class feelings, conducted in-depth visits and investigations in rural areas, understood the needs of poor and lower-middle peasants for knitted and cotton fabrics, produced many economical and practical, simple and elegant knitted and cotton fabrics suitable for peasants, and supplied them to rural areas. A type of coarse yarn deep blue with white flower bedsheet produced in Shanghai can be used as a quilt cover and also as a bedsheet, which was very popular among peasants during trial sales in rural areas. Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, Heilongjiang, and other places have produced a type of nylon-lined sock for rural areas, which is more durable and wear-resistant than ordinary socks. For knitted and cotton fabrics such as printed underwear, bedsheets, towels, and socks that peasants need, while ensuring quality, some have innovated processes, reduced production links, and lowered costs and prices.

Revolutionary workers in knitted and cotton fabric production units across the country have broken the "four olds" and established the "four news" in the patterns and designs of knitted and cotton fabrics, designing and producing many new patterns and styles that praise Chairman Mao, praise Mao Zedong Thought, reflect the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and reflect the revolutionary appearance of the times. T-shirts, singlets, and vests with Chairman Mao's inscriptions such as "Serve the People," "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," "Develop sports, enhance the people's physique," and "Study well, progress every day," and commodities with politically significant patterns have been successively supplied to the market.

    无产阶级文化大革命推动生产不断发展
    全国针棉织品生产和供应形势大好
    广大职工以革命统帅生产，深入调查，了解贫下中农需要，生产和供应进一步面向农村
    新华社上海二十八日电　在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，全国针棉织品生产和供应形势大好。根据商业部门最近在上海举行的一次会议所提供的资料，今年全国针棉织品的生产将有较大幅度的增长，供应市场的内衣、袜子、床单、毛巾等人民日常生活必需品将比去年增加很多。今年的针棉织品，无论是生产量或供应量，都将是近几年来最高的一年。
    轰轰烈烈的大好革命形势，带来了欣欣向荣的生产形势。去年我国棉花获得丰收，为针棉织品增产提供了充足的原料。不仅老工业基地生产进一步发展，一些原来产量不多的地区今年也扩大了生产，提高了针棉织品自给的比重。今年一、二月份，在加紧生产卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤、围巾、手套等冬令品种的同时，夏季用的汗衫、背心、浅色袜子等也已提前开始生产。大批针棉织品，从上海、天津、广州等城市源源运往各地。今年年初到三月二十日，上海调出针棉织品八千多吨，许多品种已经完成第一季度调拨任务，开始调拨第二季度供应的商品。江苏、陕西、北京等地因为生产发展，今年也有一些商品大量外调。现在，全国各地城镇的百货商店和农村的供销社，针棉织品货色齐备，货源充足。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国针棉织品生产系统的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结广大革命职工和革命干部，揭发和斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，批判资产阶级反动路线，贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以革命统帅生产，带动生产，出现了新局面。专门生产内衣的上海针织六厂，无产阶级革命派在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，继续沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进，在狠抓革命的同时，团结一切可以团结的力量，掀起了生产新高潮。这个厂二月份超额完成了国家计划，不仅补上一月份由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大搞反革命经济主义而欠下的产量，并且增产了大量市场需要的棉毛衫裤、汗背心。三月份生产又节节上升，一旬超过一旬。上海毛巾三厂的无产阶级革命派坚持八小时工作制，上班搞生产，下班闹革命，革命热火朝天，生产蒸蒸日上，今年以来月月超额完成国家计划，出厂的毛巾、枕巾，正品率目前已达到百分之九十九以上。
    今年我国针棉织品的生产和供应都进一步面向农村，这是以革命统帅生产的一个鲜明的特点。各地工商部门无产阶级革命派学习了毛主席的教导：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”他们明确了服务方向，怀着深厚的阶级感情，深入农村访问调查，了解贫下中农对针棉织品的要求，生产了许多经济实用、朴素大方，适合农民需要的针棉织品，供应农村。上海生产的一种粗支纱的深蓝底白花被单，既可当被面，又可作床单，在农村试销时很受农民欢迎。天津、上海、北京、黑龙江等地生产了一种供应农村的锦纶丝夹底线袜，比普通线袜结实耐穿。对农民需要的印花内衣、床单、毛巾、线袜等针棉织品，在保证质量的前提下，有的革新工艺，减少生产环节，降低了成本和售价。
    各地针棉织品生产单位的革命职工在针棉织品的花型图案上，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，设计和生产了许多歌颂毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想，反映社会主义革命和社会主义建设，反映时代革命风貌的新图案、新花样。印有“为人民服务”、“向雷锋同志学习”、“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”、“好好学习，天天向上”等毛主席题词的球衫、汗衫、背心，和富有政治意义图案的商品，已经陆续供应市场。
