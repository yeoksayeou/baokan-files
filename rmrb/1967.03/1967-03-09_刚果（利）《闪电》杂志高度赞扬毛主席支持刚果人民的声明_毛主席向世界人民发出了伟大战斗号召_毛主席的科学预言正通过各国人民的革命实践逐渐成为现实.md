In the Congolese (L) province of East, the organ of the Congolese (L) Revolutionary Youth League, the magazine "Lightning," in its January issue, reprinted in full Chairman Mao Zedong's statement of November 28, 1964, "Support the Congolese (L) People in Their Struggle Against U.S. Aggression." It also published a large portrait of Chairman Mao. The magazine also published an article titled "Mao Zedong Thought is the Highest Level of Marxism-Leninism of Our Time." The full text is as follows:

Two years ago, at the critical moment when U.S.-Belgian imperialism launched armed aggression against our country, Chairman Mao Zedong issued a great call to arms.

This statement is a great manifesto calling on all the people of the world to rise up and fight against U.S. imperialism. This manifesto has dealt a heavy blow to the arrogant aggressiveness of U.S. imperialism, strongly supported the just struggle of the Congolese people, boosted the fighting spirit of the oppressed people of various countries, pointed out the direction of their struggle, and strengthened their confidence in victory.

If the oppressed people of various countries want to resist U.S. imperialism and achieve thorough victory in the revolution, they must take up arms!

This is the great truth of Marxism-Leninism, the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao often points out that if the enemy has a knife, the people should also have a knife. "Seeing that others have something in their hands, we should investigate. What is in his hand? It's a knife. What is the use of a knife? It can kill people. Who does he want to kill with the knife? He wants to kill the people. After investigating these few things, investigate further: the Chinese people also have hands and can hold a knife. If there is no knife, they can make one. Through long-term investigation and research, the Chinese people have discovered this truth. The warlords, landlords, local bullies, evil gentry, and imperialists all have knives in their hands and want to kill people. The people have understood this and are doing the same." Once the oppressed nations and peoples of various countries grasp this truth, their revolutionary cause will have limitless hope.

Six years ago, U.S. imperialism murdered the national hero Patrice Lumumba and overthrew the legitimate government of the Congo. Subsequently, U.S. imperialism openly carried out armed intervention in the Congo several times. This caused the national independence movement to suffer a serious setback. However, the Congolese people remember the bitter lessons bought with their blood and are determined to take up arms, beginning the armed struggle they are now bravely waging across the vast land of their motherland. The Congolese people have thus embarked on the bright path leading to victory and liberation.

The aggression of U.S. imperialism has aroused the brave resistance of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the people of the whole world. U.S. imperialism is now surrounded by the people of the whole world.

U.S. imperialism is most afraid of the awakening of the people of various countries, especially the people taking up arms to wage a protracted struggle against it. U.S. imperialism is doing everything it can to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the people of various countries. However, this can only accelerate the awakening of the people and lead more and more people to take up armed struggle. Every place U.S. imperialism invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is pursuing a policy of cooperating with the United States to dominate the world and acting as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries. However, despite the help of this traitorous clique, U.S. imperialism still cannot stop the rise of the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries.

We are now in a new era of world revolution. The struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries is rapidly developing on a world scale, like a storm, and is unstoppable.

Chairman Mao's statement supporting our people in their struggle against U.S. aggression is a great call to arms to the people of the world and a scientific prediction of the future of the world revolution. This prediction is gradually becoming a reality through the revolutionary practice of the people of various countries.

The days of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are numbered.

No matter what they do, they will be overthrown, defeated, and annihilated by the revolutionary people.

In this great revolutionary struggle, the people of various countries will only lose an old world and gain a brilliant new world. The whole world will belong to the people of various countries, and it will inevitably belong to them!

    刚果（利）《闪电》杂志高度赞扬毛主席支持刚果人民的声明
    毛主席向世界人民发出了伟大战斗号召
    毛主席的科学预言正通过各国人民的革命实践逐渐成为现实
    新华社八日讯　在刚果（利）东方省出版的刚果（利）革命青年联盟机关刊物《闪电》杂志，在一月号中重新全文刊登了毛泽东主席一九六四年十一月二十八日发表的《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，同时刊登了毛主席的大幅照片。这家杂志还发表了一篇题为《毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义》的文章。全文如下：
    两年前，在美—比帝国主义向我国发动武装侵略的危急时刻，毛泽东主席发出了伟大的战斗号召。
    这个声明是一个号召全世界人民起来同美帝国主义进行战斗的伟大的宣言书。这个宣言书，给予美帝国主义者的侵略嚣张气焰以沉重打击，有力地支持了刚果人民的正义斗争，振奋了各国被压迫人民的战斗精神，向他们指出了斗争方向，并加强了他们对胜利的信心。
    各国被压迫人民如果想要抵抗美帝国主义和在革命中取得彻底的胜利，就必须拿起武器！
    这是马克思列宁主义的伟大真理，毛泽东思想的伟大真理！
  毛主席经常指出，敌人拿着刀，人民也应当拿起刀。“看到人家手里拿着东西了，我们就要调查一下。他手里拿的是什么？是刀。刀有什么用处？可以杀人。他要拿刀杀谁？要杀人民。调查了这几件事，再调查一下：中国人民也有手，也可以拿刀，没有刀可以打一把。中国人民经过长期的调查研究，发现了这个真理。军阀、地主、土豪劣绅、帝国主义，手里都拿着刀，要杀人。人民懂得了，就照样办理。”各国被压迫民族和人民，一旦掌握了这个真理，他们的革命事业就有了无限的希望。
    六年前，美帝国主义杀害了民族英雄帕特里斯·卢蒙巴，推翻了刚果合法政府。随后，美帝国主义对刚果多次公开地进行武装干涉。这使民族独立运动遭受了严重的挫折。但是，刚果人民牢记着用鲜血换来的惨痛教训，决心拿起武器，开始了他们现在在广大的祖国土地上英勇进行的武装斗争。刚果人民从此走上了把他们引向胜利和解放的光明道路。
    美帝国主义的侵略激起了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界人民的英勇反抗。美帝国主义现在已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。
    美帝国主义最害怕各国人民的觉醒，特别害怕各国人民拿起武器同它进行持久战。美帝国主义千方百计地扑灭各国人民的革命烈火。但是这只能加快人民的觉醒和促使越来越多的人民走上武装斗争的道路。美帝国主义每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。
    苏联修正主义领导集团推行同美国合作主宰世界的政策，充当美帝国主义镇压世界各国人民的革命运动的帮凶。但是，尽管美帝国主义得到这个叛徒集团的帮忙，它还是阻挡不了各国人民革命斗争的兴起。
    我们现在处在世界革命的新时代。世界范围内的反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，正在迅猛开展，势若疾风暴雨，不可阻挡。
    毛主席支持我国人民反对美国侵略的声明是向全世界人民发出的伟大战斗号召，也是对世界革命的未来的科学预言。这一预言正在通过各国人民的革命实践逐渐成为现实。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的日子不长了。
    不管他们怎么样，他们将被革命人民推翻、打败和消灭。
    在这场伟大的革命斗争中，各国人民最终只会失掉一个旧世界而获得一个光辉灿烂的新世界。全世界将属于各国人民，也必将属于他们！
