The proletarian revolutionary factions of Xiyang County in Shanxi Province, with a spirit of "seize the day," have learned from the experience of Huairou County in the Beijing suburbs, which established a first-line command center for seizing the revolution and promoting production. They have formed the "three-in-one" first-line command center for seizing the revolution and promoting production in Xiyang County.

In early February, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Xiyang County achieved great unity, seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee and the county people's committee, and established a revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ to lead the county's revolution and production. After the March 12 editorial of the People's Daily, "Establish the First-Line Command Center for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production," and the news of the establishment of the first-line command center for seizing the revolution and promoting production in Huairou County in the Beijing suburbs were published, they received great attention from the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the county, representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres. The county's "three-in-one" temporary power organ immediately convened an emergency meeting with representatives of revolutionary mass organizations to discuss the matter. The meeting agreed that establishing a first-line command center for seizing the revolution and promoting production was an urgent task and a pressing demand of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, they immediately, with a spirit of "seize the day," formed, through consultation, a first-line command center for seizing the revolution and promoting production, composed of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives of the county military sub-district.

As soon as the first-line command center for seizing the revolution and promoting production was established, it began to exercise its functions that very night. With the support of various revolutionary mass organizations, this command center selected more than 250 cadres from the county-level organs to form a spring plowing production support team. The team's mission is to go deep into the front lines of agricultural production, propagate Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country"; help communes, production brigades, and production teams at three levels to establish and improve leadership teams for seizing the revolution and promoting production, and together with the masses solve key problems in spring plowing production, implement production plans, and launch a new high tide of spring plowing production. At the same time, this command center organized a support team of more than 490 people in the industrial, transportation, and financial and commercial departments to strengthen the work related to the allocation of materials, loan issuance, and agricultural machinery matching for spring plowing production.

The "three-in-one" temporary power organ of Xiyang County issued a notice on the establishment of first-line command organs for seizing the revolution and promoting production at all levels throughout the county. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in some production brigades in the suburbs heard this news and were all jubilant. They expressed their enthusiastic support for this revolutionary measure and vowed to unite all forces to seize the revolution and promote production, launching a new high tide of spring plowing production.

    参加生产　领导生产　到群众中去解决关键问题
    孝义第一线指挥部调配干部下乡
    新华社太原十五日电　山西省孝义县的无产阶级革命派以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，学习北京郊区怀柔县成立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的经验，成立了孝义县“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。
    二月初，孝义县的无产阶级革命派实现了大联合，夺了县委、县人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，负责领导全县的革命和生产。《人民日报》三月十二日社论《建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部》和北京郊区怀柔县成立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的消息发表以后，受到这个县各革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表和革命领导干部的极大重视。县“三结合”的临时权力机构连夜召开有革命群众组织代表参加的联席会议进行研究。会上认为，建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部是当务之急，是贫下中农的迫切要求。于是，他们立即以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，经过协商，成立了由革命群众组织代表、革命领导干部和县武装部代表“三结合”组成的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。
    抓革命促生产第一线指挥部一成立，当夜就行使职权。这个指挥部在各革命群众组织的支持下，从县级机关中抽调了二百五十多名干部，组成了支援春耕生产战斗队。战斗队的任务是深入农业生产第一线，宣传毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》；帮助公社、生产大队和生产队三级建立和健全抓革命促生产的领导班子，并且和群众一起解决春耕生产中的关键问题，落实生产计划，掀起春耕生产新高潮。这个指挥部同时在工业、交通、财贸部门组织了一支四百九十多人的支援春耕后勤队，加强了有关春耕生产的物资调拨、贷款发放、农机配套等工作。
    孝义县“三结合”的临时权力机构就全县成立各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥机构发出了通告。城郊一些生产大队的贫下中农和革命群众听到这个消息，无不欢欣鼓舞，他们表示热烈拥护这一革命措施，决心团结一切力量，抓革命促生产，掀起春耕生产新高潮。
