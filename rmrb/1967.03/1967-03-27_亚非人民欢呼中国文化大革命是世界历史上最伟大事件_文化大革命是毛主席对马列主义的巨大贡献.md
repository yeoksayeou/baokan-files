Progressive peoples from some Asian and African countries have enthusiastically praised the contemporary greatest revolutionary leader, Chairman Mao, and the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in China under his wise leadership.

A Guinean youth student recently told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Conakry: "Today, all revolutionaries around the world are watching with reverence the center of world revolution—the People's Republic of China, where the proletarian cultural revolution is being successfully carried out." He emphasized, "The great revolution launched and led by the wise and great revolutionary leader of our times, Chairman Mao, is the greatest event in world history. It points out the correct path for the world revolution to achieve final victory. This is another great achievement of our beloved Chairman Mao."

The Guinean friend said, "In this cultural revolution, the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is not only widely spread throughout China but also throughout the world. The revolutionary peoples of our countries enthusiastically cheer for this, which naturally infuriates the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries. The imperialists and reactionaries of various countries are terrified. Therefore, they frantically attack and slander this cultural revolution."

He pointed out: "As Chairman Mao said, 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' The enemy's frantic attacks on the great Chinese people prove that China is completely right."

Another Guinean friend said, "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is an unprecedented great revolution. It not only ensures that the great People's Republic of China will never change color but will also have a tremendous impact on all countries. We sincerely wish the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution final victory and wish the great leader of the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries, Chairman Mao, eternal life, eternal life!"

A primary school teacher from Mali recently wrote in a letter to his Chinese friend that the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union had collapsed due to the revisionists usurping the leadership of the party. He said, "Only a profound and thorough revolution to eliminate old culture and old customs and eradicate the ideology of the exploiting class can root out the ideological basis that might allow the exploiting class to restore power."

He said, "The proletarian cultural revolution in China is indispensable for the proletariat to maintain power. The victory of China's proletarian cultural revolution has taken a step forward for the world proletarian revolution."

He said, "Therefore, you can understand why all progressive peoples are looking to Beijing with boundless hope, because Beijing has the red sun that illuminates the hearts of all peoples around the world, that is, the contemporary most outstanding and greatest Marxist, Mao Zedong."

He concluded, "We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards and the revolutionary factions of the proletariat."

An Iraqi friend said, "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a major development of Marxism-Leninism and a great contribution of Chairman Mao Zedong to Marxism." He told his Chinese friend: "I have lived in the Soviet Union for a long time. I know what the so-called 'state of the whole people' and 'party of the whole people' really are. In fact, the leaders of this country have long forgotten the teachings of Marx and Lenin and have become revisionists."

A young Iraqi expressed his respect to Chairman Mao through his Chinese friend and wished Chairman Mao a long life. He excitedly said, "Revolutionary peoples around the world place their hopes on the red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao."

Some Palestinian friends said: "Undoubtedly, the Chinese Cultural Revolution has gained the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The great significance of the Chinese Cultural Revolution will influence the entire world."

    亚非人民欢呼中国文化大革命是世界历史上最伟大事件
    文化大革命是毛主席对马列主义的巨大贡献
    新华社二十五日讯  一些亚非国家的进步人民热情赞扬当代最伟大的革命导师毛主席，和在毛主席英明领导下的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位几内亚青年学生最近向新华社驻科纳克里记者说：“今天，全世界革命者都以崇敬的心情注视着世界革命的中心——人民中国正在胜利地进行的无产阶级文化大革命。”他强调指出：“由我们时代的英明伟大的革命导师毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场大革命是世界历史上的最伟大的事件，它指出了世界革命取得最后胜利的正确道路。这是我们永远敬爱的毛主席的又一新的功勋。”
    这位几内亚朋友说：“在这场文化大革命中，光辉的毛泽东思想不仅在全中国广泛地传播，而且传播到全世界。我们各国革命人民为之热烈欢呼，这当然刺痛了帝国主义和各国反动派。帝国主义和各国反动派怕得要死。因此它们猖狂地攻击和诬蔑这场文化大革命。”
    他指出：正如毛主席所说的，“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。敌人对伟大中国人民的猖狂攻击恰恰证明中国完全做对了。
    另外一位几内亚朋友说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场史无前例的大革命。它不仅保证伟大的人民中国永远不会改变颜色，而且将在所有国家产生巨大的影响。我们衷心祝愿中国无产阶级文化大革命取得最后胜利，祝愿中国人民和世界各国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
    一位马里小学教师最近在给他的中国朋友的一封信里指出，苏联无产阶级专政由于修正主义者篡夺了党的领导而瓦解。他说，只有进行一场深刻和彻底的革命来破除旧文化和旧习惯，清除剥削阶级思想，才能根除可能使剥削阶级复辟的思想基础。
    他说：“中国所进行的无产阶级文化革命，对于无产阶级保持政权是必不可少的。中国的无产阶级文化革命的胜利，为世界无产阶级革命迈出了一步。”
    他说：“因此你可以理解，为什么所有的进步人民都心向我们无限希望所寄的北京，因为，北京有照亮全世界人民的心的红太阳，即当代最杰出、最伟大的马克思主义者毛泽东”。
    他最后说：“我们衷心支持中国红卫兵和无产阶级革命派的革命行动。”
    一位伊拉克朋友说，中国无产阶级文化大革命“是马克思列宁主义的重大发展，是毛泽东主席对马克思主义作出的巨大贡献”。他对中国朋友说：我在苏联住过很长时间。我知道所谓全民国家和全民党的实质是什么。其实，这个国家的领导人早已忘记了马克思和列宁的教导，变成了修正主义分子。
    一位伊拉克青年要求他的中国朋友转达他对毛主席的敬意，祝毛主席长寿。他激动地说：“全世界革命人民把希望寄托在他们心中的红太阳毛主席身上。”
    一些巴勒斯坦朋友说：无容置疑，中国文化大革命获得了中国人民和世界人民的支持。中国文化革命的伟大意义，必将影响全世界。
