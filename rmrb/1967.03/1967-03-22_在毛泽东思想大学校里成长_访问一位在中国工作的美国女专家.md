Recently, we visited Han Chun, an American female expert working in Beijing. She has been in China for over a decade. During this period, this intellectual woman from a capitalist country has immersed herself in China's three great revolutionary movements, working alongside Chinese workers and peasants, and continuously reforming her worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, making her thinking more revolutionary.

Over twenty years ago, young Han Chun was a passionate scientist. Her dream was to become an upright scientist. The explosion of the American atomic bomb that massacred the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shattered her dreams. She began to realize that in the United States, science could only serve imperialism.

The guns of the Chinese liberation war attracted this young American scientist. By the end of 1948, she crossed the ocean with a heart full of revolutionary fervor and arrived in China, which was rapidly being liberated. The following spring, she went to Yan'an. She enthusiastically said, "This is how I entered the school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Han Chun does not hide her thoughts. She said, "When I first came to China, I carried two ideological burdens: First, I thought I was against American imperialism and wanted revolution, so my thoughts were correct. What was there to reform? Second, I was a high-level intellectual and always felt I was the smartest, looking down on the workers and peasants, and unwilling to unite with the masses."

With such thoughts, she immediately hit a snag when she put them into practice. Soon after arriving in Shaanbei, she went to work at the Sanbian Pasture. Without conducting investigations and research among the people, she started building windmills in her room. At that time, it was March, and the wind was strong. The windmills were just installed, and they were blown away by the wind. This was the first snag. Another time, the pasture produced a lot of milk, and fresh milk could not be sold immediately, so she had to find a way to store it. She researched methods for storing milk for over a year without results. However, around the pasture, there were many Mongolian herders. Later, she went to them and found out that these herders had rich experience in storing milk. The butter and cheese they made could be stored for a long time without spoiling. Han Chun said, "I have experienced such examples many times, and I could talk about them for days and nights."

At this point, she picked up a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the table and recited Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant."

By going to the masses and practicing, her thinking gradually improved. She said, "Chinese comrades patiently helped me, and practice continuously educated me, making me truly understand Chairman Mao's wise judgment: 'Correct ideas can only come from social practice, from the three kinds of practice in society, namely, production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment.'"

Last year, Han Chun was transferred to work in Beijing, just as a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution was unfolding across China. In this great revolution that touches people's souls, Han Chun and her family strongly wanted to participate in China's cultural revolution. In late August, she and her husband, along with two other American friends, wrote a big-character poster expressing their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and their boundless love for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The poster stated, "We are determined to become true revolutionaries and steadfast anti-revisionist fighters. To carry the struggle against American imperialism to the end, we are determined to temper and test ourselves. Our descendants must become steadfast and reliable revolutionary successors and must not become revisionists."

Han Chun has worked and lived in New China for over a decade and deeply feels that Chinese women have truly been liberated. She said that as an ordinary intellectual woman from the United States, she only understood how to work for the people and for the revolution after coming to China, which is the greatest happiness.

At this point, she thought of her homeland, of American women, especially those living at the bottom of American society, who are still under the most brutal exploitation and oppression by the American monopoly capitalist groups. She also thought of the women in South Vietnam, who are bravely investing all their strength in the great people's war of anti-American resistance and national salvation, striking hard blows against the American aggressors. Women in South Vietnam have risen up in revolution, and women in the United States will one day rise up in revolution, and all oppressed women in the world will rise up in revolution.

Han Chun finally recited Chairman Mao's famous saying about the liberation of Chinese women: "The day when all women in China rise up is the day of the victory of the Chinese revolution." Han Chun said, Chairman Mao's words are profound. This not only encourages Chinese women but also all women in the world.

    在毛泽东思想大学校里成长
    ——访问一位在中国工作的美国女专家
    不久前，我们访问了在北京工作的美国女专家寒春同志。她来中国已经十几年了。在这段不短的时间里，这位来自资本主义国家的知识妇女，投身到中国的三大革命运动中，同中国的工农群众在一起，用毛泽东思想不断改造自己的世界观，不断使自己的思想革命化。
    二十多年前，年轻的寒春，是一个热爱科学的青年。自己的理想就是要做一个正直的科学家。屠杀广岛和长崎人民的美国原子弹的爆炸声，惊破了她的幻梦。她开始认识到，在美国，科学只能为帝国主义服务。
    中国解放战争的炮火，吸引着这位美国青年科学工作者。一九四八年底，她怀着满腔的革命热情，飘洋过海，来到了正在迅速解放的中国。第二年春天，她到了延安。她热情地说：“我就是这样进入毛泽东思想的大学校的。”
    寒春同志丝毫也不隐藏自己的思想。她说：“初来中国，我背着两个思想包袱：第一、我认为自己是反对美帝国主义的，要革命的，思想很正确，还有什么可以改造的呢？第二、我是一个高级知识分子，总觉得自己最聪明，看不起工农群众，不愿意同群众结合。”
    带着这样的思想，一到实践中，就碰了钉子。她刚到陕北，就去三边牧场工作。没有到群众中去进行调查研究，就闭门造起风车来。当时，正是三月风大，风车刚安好，就被大风刮坏了。这是第一次碰钉子。还有一次，牧场里生产的牛奶很多，鲜奶一时出售不完，要想法储存。她就研究储存牛奶的方法，研究了一年多，没有结果。可是，在牧场周围，就住着不少蒙古族牧民，后来，她到他们中间去，才知道这些牧民有很丰富的储存牛奶的经验，他们做的黄油、奶酪，存放很长的时间都不会坏。寒春同志说，“我亲身经历的这样的例子很多，很多，就是几天几夜也谈不完。”
    讲到这里，她从桌子上顺手拿起一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，背诵着毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。
    到群众中去，到实践中去，她的思想逐步提高了。她说：“中国同志耐心地帮助我，实践不断地教育我，才使我真正地理解毛主席的英明论断：‘人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。’”
    寒春同志去年调到北京工作，正是一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命在全中国广泛展开的时候。在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，寒春同志和她的全家人都强烈地要求参加中国的文化大革命。八月底，她和她的爱人，还有另外两位美国朋友一起，写了一张大字报，表达了对我们伟大的领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱。这张大字报中写道“我们决心成为真正坚强的革命者，成为坚强的反修战士。为了把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，我们决心锻炼和考验我们自己。我们的后代必须成为坚强可靠的革命接班人，而绝不允许他们变成修正主义分子。”
    寒春同志在新中国工作、生活了十几年，深深地体会到，中国妇女得到了真正的解放。她说，她作为一个美国普通的知识妇女，只是到了中国以后，才懂得了为人民、为革命而工作，这是最大的幸福。
    谈到这里，她不禁想到了自己的祖国，想到了美国的妇女，特别是生活在美国社会最底层的黑人妇女，她们还生活在美国垄断资本集团最残酷的剥削和压迫之下。她又想到了越南南方的妇女，这些英勇的姐妹们，正把全部力量投入抗美救国的伟大的人民战争中去，狠狠地打击美国侵略者。越南南方妇女起来革命了，美国妇女总有一天也要起来革命的，世界上一切被压迫的妇女都要起来革命的。
    寒春同志最后背诵了毛主席关于中国妇女解放的一句名言：“全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时。”寒春同志说，毛主席这句话说得深刻极了。这不仅是对中国妇女，也是对全世界妇女的巨大鼓舞。
