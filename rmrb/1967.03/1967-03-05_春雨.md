Spring Rain

Shanghai Drama Academy Revolutionary Building, Fei Liangqiong

The spring plowing production in the suburbs of Shanghai is booming. The fields are bustling with activity. Red flags flutter in the wind, and poor and lower-middle-class peasants are full of fighting spirit. They carry fertilizer and soil, loosen the earth, dig canals and ditches, and cultivate seedlings. They gather to study Chairman Mao's quotations and sing revolutionary songs together. Laughter and songs paint a new picture of the countryside in the midst of the Cultural Revolution!

There is so much spring scenery to see, and so many miles of brocade to walk! As I was about to reach Xiaolongzhuang, the sky gradually darkened. I hadn't been to Xiaolongzhuang in two years. In these two years, irrigation canals and electric fences have been built in this area, and I was no longer familiar with the way to Xiaolongzhuang. I was worried about not being able to ask for directions, when suddenly a big man caught up with me from behind. I saw him carrying two large sacks on his shoulders, and in a few steps, he passed by me. I quickly asked, "Comrade! How do I get to Xiaolongzhuang?"

"Follow me!" He answered me in a deep voice, "Follow me!" without turning his head, he walked forward in big strides.

I hurried to catch up with him and started a conversation.

"Are you from Xiaolongzhuang?"

"Yeah."

"Hear that Xiaolongzhuang's spring plowing is going well!"

"Hard to say."

Hey! This is indeed an advanced unit; look how humble they are!

I asked him again, "Do you know the call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the poor and lower-middle-class peasants and cadres to seize the revolution and promote spring plowing?"

"You mean the letter Chairman Mao wrote to us? Hey, it's right here!" He shifted the load on his shoulders and patted his chest excitedly, saying, "Chairman Mao cares about us. This letter is like a timely rain! Tonight, the team is going to have a meeting to convey this matter!"

At this point, the big man seemed to have endless energy, and his words flowed like a river.

"Chairman Mao cares about us. This letter is like a timely rain! Tonight, the team is going to have a meeting to convey this matter!"

As he spoke, the big man seemed to have boundless energy, and his steps became bigger and bigger. He noticed that I was having trouble keeping up with his pace and turned his head to look at me. Because it was dark, I couldn't see his expression clearly, but I saw him wipe the sweat from his forehead with his hand. This familiar gesture reminded me of Agen from Xiaolongzhuang. I thought to myself, could it be him?

"Agen!" I called out to him.

He suddenly stopped in his tracks, put down his load, and turned around. With a big smile, he said, "Ah! It's you! What brings you here?"

"To participate in a few days of labor!"

"Come on, let's go to my house to rest!"

At this moment, Xiaolongzhuang was just ahead.

Agen led me to his house. The villagers were having a meeting there! A few young men were arguing loudly about something.

He put down his load with a thud, and someone inside shouted, "Agen is back!"

The door opened, and a few young men rushed out, joking and laughing with Agen, and dragged him into the house. One of the young men shouted, "Agen, you came back just in time. We were just talking about spring plowing production. I want to form a youth shock team to accumulate fertilizer, but Chunbao is arguing with me. You..."

The young man's face was flushed, and his words were a bit stammered.

"Who's arguing with you! You're the one arguing with me! Hey, Agen, what good things did you bring back from the county?"

"Yeah!" Agen went out to the door and brought in the two sacks he had just carried back, saying, "These are high-quality seeds from the county farm!"

An elder sitting by the door took out a handful of seeds from the sack, held them in his hand, and examined them under the lamp, saying, "Good seeds! Agen is really thoughtful. We were just planning to send someone out to exchange seeds tomorrow morning!"

In the dim light, I recognized him as Xin Bo, the leader of the poor peasants' association.

"Xin Bo, there's even better stuff!" Everyone heard Agen say this, and the room suddenly fell silent. Agen solemnly took out a neatly folded copy of the People's Daily from his chest and said, "Chairman Mao has issued a great call to us to seize the revolution, promote production, and fire the first shot of spring plowing, and he has written a letter to us poor and lower-middle-class peasants and cadres!"

Agen's powerful voice was like a spring thunder, shaking the small house. The small house became even more lively.

Chunbao snatched the newspaper and read it aloud. Everyone held their breath and listened intently. The room was so quiet that you could only hear the sound of spring rain falling outside.

The letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee ignited a fire in the hearts of the people of Xiaolongzhuang.

Xin Bo said, "Chairman Mao's words have given us poor and lower-middle-class peasants a backbone. We poor and lower-middle-class peasants must stand tall and straight, seize the revolution, and fire the first shot of spring plowing to achieve results. We must not let a handful of capitalist roaders laugh at us revolutionaries."

Agen also said, "At the county's spring plowing rally, after reading the letter from the Party Central Committee, the enthusiasm of the brother teams was fully aroused, and they even challenged us in Xiaolongzhuang! What do you all say?"

"Accept the challenge!" Everyone replied in unison.

Chunbao jumped up from his seat and said, "Tomorrow morning, let's have a full-scale mobilization. The youth will accumulate fertilizer and mud, the women and children will select seeds, and the old farmers will repair agricultural tools and water wheels..."

Everyone chatted and laughed, making the small house lively and warm. Everyone was eagerly planning and strategizing for this year's spring plowing production!

At this moment, Agen nudged the person next to him who had been silent all along, saying, "Lin Xiang, you say something!"

Lin Xiang stood up, too excited to speak for a long time. He held the letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the poor and lower-middle-class peasants and cadres and said, "I have let Chairman Mao down. In the previous stage, I was deceived by the capitalist roaders in power, my attitude was passive, and I wanted to lie down and do nothing... Hey, I..."

I leaned over to Xin Bo and asked, "What's wrong with Lin Xiang?"

Xin Bo said, "He had a burden on his mind. We revolutionaries had a few heart-to-heart talks with him and helped him. Now he has seen the light and even posted a big-character poster about himself!"

I asked, "How did you help him?"

"With the Party's policy on cadres and Chairman Mao's 'punish the past and cure the present, treat the disease and save the patient' medicine!"

I heard Lin Xiang still saying, "Last year's three springs, I pulled a lot of labor to the East Bay to open a river, resulting in delayed agricultural work and committing the error of subjective command. I want to report to everyone."

Xin Bo said, "Lin Xiang, opening the river is not wrong in itself. The mistake is that you did not consult with everyone and should not have opened the river in the three springs. Lin Xiang, you have made mistakes, but that's not scary. As long as you listen to Chairman Mao's words and correct them well, the poor and lower-middle-class peasants will support you."

Lin Xiang gathered his courage and said, "The letter from the Party Central Committee encourages me to go to the production front line. I will definitely discuss with everyone and work together to seize the spring plowing production."

The small house erupted in a burst of enthusiastic applause. Lin Xiang, moved to tears, said from the bottom of his heart, "The spring rain from the sky only moistens the land, but the spring rain from Beijing irrigates our hearts!"

The next day, when it was still dimly lit, the villagers of Xiaolongzhuang were already preparing to go to work. Suddenly, a noisy drum and gong sound came from the village entrance. In the blink of an eye, a group of people banging drums and gongs had already arrived. It turned out to be the revolutionary workers from the farm machinery factory who had come to report good news with the letter from the Party Central Committee. The representative said, "We read the letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and organized a team to support spring plowing production overnight. We came to help you repair agricultural tools on the spot. The comrades from the rear and the supply and marketing cooperatives are also out to support you!"

The villagers heard the drum and gong sounds and ran out of their homes with tools. Agen took the opportunity to stand on a high place and said, "Comrades, let us respond to Chairman Mao's great call and work hard to ensure a good spring plowing production!"

A vast spring plowing production army, stepping on the land moistened by the spring rain, took big strides towards the boiling fields...

    春雨
    上海戏剧学院革命楼　费良琼
    上海郊区农村的春耕生产热潮蓬勃地掀起来了。
    田野上，一片热气腾腾的景象。一面面鲜红的大旗迎风招展；一队队贫下中农社员斗志昂扬。他们挑肥担土，松土坌地，开渠挖沟，育苗选种。他们围在一起学习毛主席语录，又齐声高唱革命歌曲。一片片笑语，一阵阵欢歌，绘出了处在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中的农村新图！
    看不尽一片春色，走不完十里锦绣！当我快走到小浏庄的时候，天渐渐黑下来。小浏庄我已经两年没来了，两年中，这一带筑起了水渠，拉起了电网，往小浏庄怎么走，我已经不太熟悉了。我正愁着没法问个讯，忽然从我后边赶上一个大汉来，只见他肩挑两口大麻袋，三脚两步就从我身边擦了过去。我赶紧发问：“同志！去小浏庄怎么走啊？”
      “跟着走！”他用粗嗓门直通通地答了我三个字，头也没回，大步流星地朝前走着。
    我用小跑步赶上他。然后找上几句话向他发问。
    “你也是小浏庄的？”
    “嗳。”
    “听说小浏庄的春耕生产搞得不错呀！”
    “难说。”
    嘿！到底是先进单位，你看人家多谦虚！
    我又问他：“毛主席、党中央向贫下中农和干部发出的抓革命促春耕的号召知道了吧？”
    “你说的是毛主席他老人家写给我们的信呀？嗨，正在这儿呢！”他把担子转了个肩膀，拍拍自己的心窝，兴奋地说。
    一提到这封信，大个子劲头十足，话匣子也打开了。
    “毛主席就是关心我们。这封信是场及时雨啊！今儿晚上，队里正要开会传达这个事呢！”说到这里，大个子就象有使不完的劲似的，脚步越跨越大。他觉察到我有点跟不上他的步伐，回过头来看了看我。因为天黑，我看不清他对我做了个什么表情，只见他使劲地用手撩了把大汗。这个熟悉的动作，使我想起小浏庄的阿根来。我心里想：莫不是他？……
    “阿根！”我冲着他喊了一声。
    他猛地把双脚刹住，放下担子，转过身来。咧开大嘴说：“哎呀！是你呀！干啥来啦？”
    “参加几天劳动！”
    “走，上家去歇歇！”
    这时候，小浏庄也就在眼前了。
    阿根把我领到他家门前。社员们正在他家里开会呢！几个小伙子直着喉咙在争着什么。
    他把担子往地上“扑”的一放，屋里就有人喊了起来：“阿根哥回来了！”
    门开了，屋里一下涌出几个棒小伙子来，跟阿根亲热地打闹了一阵，就把他往屋里拖。一个小伙子放开嗓门喊：“阿根哥，你回来得正好，刚才我们正在谈春耕生产的事呢！我想成立一个青年突击积肥组，可是春宝硬是跟我夺，你……”小伙子的脸胀得红通通的，话也有点结巴了。
    “谁跟你夺啦！是你在和我争呢！嗳，阿根哥，你去县里开会，带什么好东西回来啦？”
    “有呀！”阿根跨到门外把刚才担回来的两麻袋东西拎了进来说：“这是从县农场调回来的良种！”
    坐在门边的一位大伯从麻袋里掏出一把种子来，放在手心里凑着灯光端详着，连声说：“好种啊！阿根真个是有心人，家里正打算明早派人出去调换呢！”
    借着灯光，我看清楚他就是贫协的辛伯。
    “辛伯，还有更好更好的东西呢！”大伙儿听阿根这么一说，顿时静了下来。阿根稳稳重重地从怀里掏出一张叠得整整齐齐的《人民日报》，说：
    “毛主席他老人家向我们发出抓革命，促生产，打响春耕第一炮的伟大号召，给我们贫下中农和干部写信来啦！”
    阿根宏亮的声音，象一声春雷，震动了小屋。小屋加倍地热闹了起来。
    春宝抢过报纸，放开嗓门念了起来。人们屏住气静心地听着。屋子里静极了。只听见屋外下起细细的春雨来。
    毛主席、党中央的信，给小浏庄人的心头点燃了一把火。
    辛伯说：“毛主席的话撑了我们贫下中农的腰杆子，我们贫下中农的腰板就是要挺得硬硬的，抓好革命，打响春耕第一炮，做出成绩来。可不能让一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派看我们革命派的笑话。”
    阿根也说：“这次县里开春耕誓师大会，读了党中央的信，兄弟社队的干劲都鼓得足足的，还向我们小浏庄提出了挑战呢！大伙说，我们该怎么样？”
    “坚决应战！”大伙齐声回答。
    春宝从凳上蹦起来说：“明天一早就来它个全面出动，青年人积肥罱泥，妇女小孩选种，老农整修农具水车……”
    大家你一语我一言，有说有笑，把小屋闹得热腾腾的，哪一个不在为今年的春耕生产精打细算，出谋献策啊！
    这时候，阿根用手肘碰碰身边那个闷着头一直不说话的人，说：“林祥，你也说说吧！”
    林祥站起身子，激动得老半天没说出话来。他拿着毛主席、党中央给贫下中农和干部的那封信：“我对不起毛主席他老人家，前一阶段，我上了走资本主义道路当权派的当，态度消极，想躺倒不干……。嗨，我……”
    我凑到辛伯耳朵根上问：“林祥他怎么啦？”
    辛伯说：“他思想上背过包袱，我们革命派跟他交了几次心，对他进行帮助，现在他开通了，自己还贴了自个儿的大字报呢！”
    我问：“你们怎么个帮助法？”
      “党的干部政策，毛主席的‘惩前毖后、治病救人’这帖良药呀！”
    只听见林祥还在说：“去年三春，我抽了好些劳力到东湾开河，结果误了农事，犯了主观主义瞎指挥的错误，我要向大伙检查。”
    辛伯说：“林祥，开河本来也没啥错，错就错在你做事没跟大伙商量，不该在三春开河。林祥啊，你有错误，这不怕，只要听毛主席的话，好好改正，贫下中农就会支持你的。”
    林祥鼓足勇气说：“党中央的信鼓舞我走上生产第一线，我一定和大伙一起商量，一起劳动，抓好春耕生产。”
    小屋里爆发出一阵热烈的掌声。林祥激动地掉下了热泪，打心眼里说：“天上落下的春雨只是滋润土地，从北京落来的春雨，灌溉着我们的心田！”
    第二天，天色朦朦亮的时候，小浏庄的社员们已经准备出工了。忽然，从村头传来一阵喧闹的锣鼓声。一转眼，一群人敲锣打鼓地已经来到了眼前。原来是农具厂的革命派工人拿着党中央的信报喜来了。代表说：“我们读了毛主席、党中央的信，连夜组织起一个下乡队支援春耕生产，来就地帮助你们整修农具。后边部队同志和供销社同志也出动支援你们来了！”
    社员们听到锣鼓声，拿了工具从家里跑了出来。阿根就势往高处一站说：“同志们，让我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，为搞好春耕生产而大干吧！”
    一支浩浩荡荡的春耕生产大军，踩着被春雨滋润的土地，迈着大步朝着沸腾的田野奔去……
