American pilots are afraid of death and go to church to pray for God's protection.

Our newspaper reports: Due to their fear of the iron fist of the Vietnamese people and the unjust nature of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, the morale of those American air pirates who were ordered to indiscriminately bomb North Vietnam is extremely low, with each one fearing death and hating the war.

According to some American pilots captured by the people of North Vietnam, many American pilots training at two bases in Florida—Eglin and McDill—refuse to go to Vietnam to fight. They say: "The morale of American pilots is declining," "The situation of pilots openly protesting to their commanders is increasing."

These prisoners say: American pilots "before leaving for Vietnam, all insure themselves with insurance companies, and often go to church to pray for God's protection." They say: "These airmen, on the day they are scheduled to fly, when the weather is bad and the flight is postponed, they are overjoyed. When they return from their flights, they avoid talking about the attack situation, and many start drinking to dispel their worries."

Recently, the American *New York Times Magazine* revealed that some American pilots, when talking about the air defense forces of North Vietnam, said: "The defense is terrifying," "and it seems to be getting stronger. Sometimes it seems like every tree is firing at you."

    美国飞行员怕死
    到教堂做礼拜祈求上帝保佑
    本报讯　由于害怕越南人民的铁拳和美国侵越战争的非正义性质，美国那些奉命滥炸越南北方的空中强盗士气十分低落，个个怕死、厌战。
    据一些被越南北方人民俘获的美国驾驶员供称，在美国“佛罗里达两个基地——埃格林和麦克迪尔——受训的许多美国驾驶员拒绝到越南去打仗”。他们说：“美国驾驶员的士气正在下降”，“驾驶员公开向他们的指挥官抗议的情况正在增加”。
    这些俘虏说：美国驾驶员“在动身赴越南之前，都向保险公司保了险，并且经常到教堂做礼拜，祈求神的保佑。”他们说：“这些空军人员，在轮到他们飞行的那一天，当天气不好而把飞行推迟时，他们都欣喜若狂。当他们飞行回来时，都避免谈论袭击情况，许多人都喝起酒来，以解愁闷”。
    不久前，美国《纽约时报杂志》透露，一些美国飞行员谈到越南北方人民的防空力量时说：“防御是可怕的”，“而且似乎是越来越强。有时候看来每一棵树都在向你开火”。
