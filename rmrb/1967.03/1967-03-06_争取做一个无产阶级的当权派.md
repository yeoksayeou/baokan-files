In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was deceived by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, committing many crimes in the district people's committee office. Instead of directing the spearhead of struggle at the capitalist-roaders within the Party, I directed it at the revolutionary masses, inciting the masses to fight each other, completely reversing right and wrong, and confusing right from wrong.

I did not initially recognize these crimes. When revolutionary masses in the office asked me to make a self-criticism, I felt wronged and always wanted the district committee to make a self-criticism first, so I could slip by. However, the development of the revolutionary situation, especially after hearing the revolutionary masses' exposure and criticism, and reading the editorial "The Victory of the Proletarian Revolutionary Line Represented by Chairman Mao" in the 14th issue of *Red Flag* magazine in 1966, my thoughts underwent a fierce struggle: Should I admit to carrying out the bourgeois reactionary line? Should I admit my mistakes? If I admitted these, what would the consequences be? And so on. Before me were two paths to choose from: either persist in the bourgeois reactionary line and not admit mistakes, or quickly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This was a struggle between two classes and two lines, and there could be no ambiguity. With this question in mind, I reread the editorial in the 14th issue of *Red Flag* magazine in 1966. I thought, having made mistakes in the past, now Chairman Mao is saving me, and I must not continue to make mistakes. I decided to make a thorough self-criticism to the revolutionary masses and strive to become a revolutionary cadre. However, due to the long-term influence of the so-called "organizational discipline" of the bourgeois reactionary line, I ended up going to the original district committee for instructions.

My intention to correct my mistakes was met with suppression by the responsible person in the original district committee who faithfully carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. He did not want me to check the problem of attacking the masses and threatened, "Don't be a softie." This remark sparked an even more intense struggle in my thoughts. Listening to Chairman Mao's words and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's words, having the courage to honestly self-criticize to the revolutionary masses is being a softie? Is it not being a hardliner to listen to the district committee that persists in the bourgeois reactionary line? Thinking about Chairman Mao's teachings, looking at the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries who dare to pull the emperor off his throne, I began to see this as a major issue of standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and made a more profound self-criticism to the revolutionary masses.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out more and more deeply, and the revolutionary flames within the office are becoming more and more intense. I further studied the editorials in *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine. Under Chairman Mao's continuous guidance, with the help of the proletarian revolutionaries and the education of ironclad facts, I gradually woke up and gradually saw through the reactionary nature of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original district committee, who always tried every means to resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In this situation, what should I do? Should I continue to follow these guys, or should I rise up in revolution?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism can all be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" Chairman Mao also says: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must serve the people's interests. If there are errors, they must be corrected, and this is what it means to be responsible to the people." Through study and ideological struggle, I thought, to be a revolutionary cadre, one must listen to Chairman Mao's words and rise up in revolution! But I also thought, I am a standing committee member of the district committee, and also a leader, the district committee's errors are also my share, can I rise up in rebellion? Will the masses believe me, will they support me?

When I was in the midst of this ideological struggle, comrades from the proletarian revolutionary faction in the office came to help me and encouraged me to rise up in revolution. This increased my confidence. Comrade Lin Biao teaches us: "We must regard ourselves as a revolutionary force, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of revolution. Revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, this revolution will not be successful." As a Communist Party member, one must follow Chairman Mao and rise up in revolution, and at the same time, revolutionize oneself. With the courage to revolutionize oneself, I dared to expose myself. My transformation was supported and encouraged by the proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary masses.

From then on, following Chairman Mao's teachings, I resolutely faced the revolutionary masses directly and stayed with the masses. In doing so, I learned the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries, saw the boundless love of the broad revolutionary masses for Chairman Mao, and also saw the harm of my past implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line. In contrast, I felt ashamed of my waning revolutionary will, and I more intimately felt Chairman Mao's great wisdom, and more deeply understood the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the future, I will more firmly stand with the revolutionary faction, forever follow Chairman Mao, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, launch a great struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, launch a great struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and launch a great struggle against the "self" in my mind, transforming myself into a genuine revolutionary cadre. I will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," carry forward the revolutionary spirit, be a servant of the people, prioritize revolutionary interests, stand out, dare to work, dare to take responsibility, and resolutely shoulder the heavy burden of revolution and production. Together with comrades from the proletarian revolutionary faction, I will strive to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and build a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought!

    争取做一个无产阶级的当权派
    原上海长宁区副区长　胡华清
    在无产阶级文化大革命的初期，我受了旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，执行了资产阶级反动路线，在区人委机关里犯下了许多罪行，不是把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而是指向革命群众，挑动了群众斗群众，完全颠倒了黑白，混淆了是非。
    我对这些罪行，开始是很不认识的。当机关革命群众要我检查时，感到委屈，总想让区委先检查，我就可以滑过去。但是革命形势的发展，特别是听了革命群众的揭发和批判，读了《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十四期社论《以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利》以后，我思想上展开了剧烈的斗争：要不要承认执行了资产阶级反动路线？要不要承认自己的错误？如果承认了这些，后果又将如何？等等。在我面前摆着两条道路，由我来选择：要么坚持资产阶级反动路线，不承认错误；要么迅速站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。这是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，一点也不能含糊。我带着这个问题又重新读了《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十四期社论。我想，过去犯了错误，现在毛主席来挽救我，再不能继续犯错误了，决心彻底向革命群众交代，争取做一个革命的领导干部。但是由于我长期受资产阶级反动路线的所谓“组织性、纪律性”的影响，结果还是到原区委去请示了。
    我要改正错误的想法，遭到了忠实执行资产阶级反动路线的原区委负责人的打击。他不要我检查整群众的问题，并威胁说：“你不要做软骨头。”这句话引起了我更激烈的思想斗争。我听毛主席的话，听林彪副主席的话，有勇气向革命群众老实检查承认错误是软骨头吗？难道听坚持资产阶级反动路线的区委的话才是硬骨头吗？想想毛主席的教导，看看无产阶级革命派的“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命精神，开始觉得这是站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的大问题。我决心遵照毛主席的教导，向革命群众作了较深刻的检查。
    无产阶级文化大革命越来越深入地开展起来，机关内部的革命火焰也越来越旺，我又进一步学习了《人民日报》和《红旗》杂志社论。在毛主席的不断指引下，在无产阶级革命派的帮助和铁的事实的教育下，我逐渐清醒起来，逐渐看清了原区委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动本质，他们总是想尽办法抵制毛主席的革命路线。在这种情况下，我应该怎么办呢？是继续跟这些家伙走下去，还是起来革命？
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”毛主席还说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”经过学习和思想斗争，我想，要做一个革命的领导干部，就要听毛主席的话，就要起来革命！可是我又想，我是区委的常委，也是个当权派，区委的错误我也有份，我起来造反行不行呢？群众会不会相信我，会不会支持我呢？
    当我正在思想斗争的时候，机关的无产阶级革命派的同志来帮助我，鼓励我起来革命。这使我增加了信心。林彪同志教导我们：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”作为一个共产党员，就要跟着毛主席走，就应该起来革命，同时也要革自己的命。有了勇气革自己的命，我才敢于起来揭发。我的这个转变，得到了无产阶级革命派和革命群众的支持和鼓励。
    从此以后，遵照毛主席的教导，我坚决和革命群众直接见面，和群众在一起。这样一来，我学到了无产阶级革命派的大无畏的革命精神，看到了广大革命群众对毛主席的无限热爱，也看到了我过去执行资产阶级反动路线的危害，相比之下，自愧革命意志衰退，更亲切地感到毛主席的英明伟大，也更深刻地体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力。
    今后我要更坚定地和革命派站在一起，永远跟着毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造自己头脑中私字的反，把自己改造成一个真正的革命领导干部。我坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，发扬革命精神，做人民的勤务员，以革命利益为重，挺身而出，敢于工作，敢于负责，坚决把革命和生产的重担挑起来，和无产阶级革命派的同志一起，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为建设一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界而奋斗！
