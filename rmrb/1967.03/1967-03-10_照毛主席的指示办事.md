A friend from Pemba Island in Zanzibar, who had the honor of meeting Chairman Mao during a visit to China, was deeply moved as he spoke to Chinese friends:

“Meeting the great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness of my life.” As he spoke, he took out a shining red copy of the “Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong” from his breast pocket. He said:

“I want to be like the Chinese Red Guards, studying the ‘Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong’ every day and acting according to Chairman Mao’s instructions. Before I start work each day, I read a passage from the ‘Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong.’ Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon. Revolutionary people must master it.”

This friend from Pemba Island was filled with passion as he sang along with Chinese friends in Chinese, “The East is Red,” a song praising the great leader Chairman Mao, and shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao!”

    照毛主席的指示办事
    一位在访问中国时见到过毛主席的桑给巴尔奔巴岛的朋友，十分激动地向中国朋友说：
  “我在访问中国时见到伟大领袖毛主席，这是我一生中最大的幸福。”说着他随手从上衣口袋里拿出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。他说：
  “我要象中国红卫兵那样，天天学习《毛主席语录》，按照毛主席的指示办事。我每天开始工作前都读一段毛主席语录。毛泽东思想是最锐利的武器。革命的人民必须掌握它。”这位奔巴岛的朋友还满怀激情地同中国朋友一道用中文高唱歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》，欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
