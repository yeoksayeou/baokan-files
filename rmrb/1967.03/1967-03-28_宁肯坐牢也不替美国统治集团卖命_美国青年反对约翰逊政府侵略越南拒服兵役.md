American imperialism is being beaten bloody by the heroic people of South Vietnam on the battlefield, and at home, it is facing increasingly strong opposition from the American people.

In the struggle against the Johnson administration's aggression in Vietnam, American youth are becoming an increasingly important force. They are taking various actions to oppose the war in Vietnam.

At Harvard University and Radcliffe College, over six hundred students held a demonstration against the war in Vietnam on February 13th when the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Goldberg, came to the school for an activity.

American youth, undeterred by various threats, are rising up to refuse military service, firmly refusing to become cannon fodder for the American ruling class's aggression. Currently, thousands of American youth have fled to Canada for this reason. Many young people have expressed that they would rather go to jail than fight for American imperialism. According to incomplete statistics, since 1960, over 2,400 young people have been prosecuted by the authorities for "violating" the U.S. military service law, of which 1,700 have been convicted. In the past year alone, up to June 30, 1966, 680 American youth were prosecuted in court for refusing to serve in South Vietnam, a number that is more than double that of the previous year.

The American ruling class has brutally persecuted American youth who refuse military service. Anyone who refuses military service will be punished, with the maximum penalty being a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for five years. However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. An African American youth who was sentenced for refusing military service said well: The war that America is waging in Vietnam is an unjust war, and he has no reason to die for it. Even the American bourgeois commentator Lipmann had to admit in an article in *Newsweek* that the war in Vietnam "is neither a war of popular will nor a war that (American) people are willing to sacrifice for. In fact, we believe that evading military service is a correct and glorious act."

    宁肯坐牢也不替美国统治集团卖命
    美国青年反对约翰逊政府侵略越南拒服兵役
    本报讯　美帝国主义在南越战场上被英雄的南越人民打得头破血流，在国内也遭到越来越多的美国人民的强烈反对。
    在美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵略越南的斗争中，美国青年是一股日益重要的力量。他们以各种行动反对侵越战争。
    哈佛大学和拉德克利夫学院，有六百多名学生于二月十三日，在美国驻联合国大使戈德堡前来学校活动时，举行反对侵越战争的示威。
    美国青年不怕种种威胁，奋起拒绝服兵役，坚决不愿充当美国统治集团的侵略炮灰。目前已有数千名美国青年为此而逃往加拿大。许多青年表示，宁愿坐牢，也决不为美帝国主义卖命。据不完全统计，自一九六○年以来，因为“破坏”美国兵役法而被当局控告的青年，竟达两千四百多名，其中一千七百多名还被判了罪。而在一九六六年六月三十日截止的过去一年中，就有六百八十名美国青年因拒绝到南越服兵役而遭到法庭的控告，这个数字超过了上年度的一倍。
    美国统治集团对拒服兵役的美国青年，进行了残酷迫害。谁拒服兵役，就要受处罚，最高竟达罚款五千美元并被投入监狱拘禁五年。但是，有压迫就有反抗，美国青年并没有被反动派的迫害所吓倒。一个因拒服兵役而被判刑的黑人青年说得好：美国在越南进行的战争，是一场非正义的战争，他没有理由为它去送死。甚至连美国资产阶级评论员李普曼在《新闻周刊》上发表的文章中也不得不说，侵越战争“既不是民心趋向的战争，也不是（美国）人们自愿为它牺牲的战争。甚至，我们认为逃避兵役的行为是正确和光荣的。”
