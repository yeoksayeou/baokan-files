The current phase of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is one of "three-in-one" combinations to seize power. To accomplish the glorious task assigned to us by Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary factions must unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rally revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people, and form a mighty revolutionary army. At this juncture, we, the warriors of the original Forward Brigade of Peking University, have re-studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party." We deeply feel that what Chairman Mao said thirty-seven years ago is as fresh and relevant as if he had said it yesterday. These words are like a clear spring that washes away all non-proletarian thoughts from our minds.

To seize power, we must implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions. On this issue, our original Forward Brigade also had various erroneous understandings. Some comrades said, "Our brigade has already gone out to fight. If we unite, the name of our brigade will be abolished, and we will feel reluctant." Others said, "To unite, we just need to expand a bit more." Still, others bluntly said, "To seize power, as long as it is distributed evenly from above, our brigade can also seize a unit or two." Some comrades also did not want to unite with revolutionary organizations they had previously argued with, always feeling that others had this flaw or that error, and that their own brigade was better. They thought that uniting would weaken their fighting strength.

With these questions in mind, we compared our thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings and engaged in a fierce struggle within our souls. Everyone seriously examined the root causes and realized that the aforementioned thoughts were all manifestations of small-groupism, sectarianism, subjectivism, and other petty-bourgeois thoughts in our minds, which are extremely harmful. Unless we thoroughly eliminate them, we cannot transform our ranks into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready force, we cannot achieve the true unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and we cannot accomplish the task of seizing power. As Chairman Mao said, "To pay attention only to the interests of one's own small group and not to the interests of the whole, to appear not to be for oneself but actually to contain extremely narrow personal interests..." Chairman Mao's words hit the nail on the head, pointing out that the essence of small-groupism is personalism, that there is still a "self" in our minds. One comrade said well: Now, the proletarian revolutionary factions must unite and seize power. We must first wage a struggle in our minds to seize power! This means seizing the power of "self" and establishing the power of "public." Without breaking down "self," it is impossible to establish "public." A true proletarian revolutionary should have the farthest vision and the broadest mind. What is a small group? All our struggles are for the revolutionary cause of the entire proletariat. We want the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, a true alliance based on Mao Zedong Thought. Let those small-groupism, sectarianism, and opportunism that are incompatible with the great alliance all go to hell!

The great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions is an inevitable trend in the development of the Cultural Revolution, and all erroneous tendencies that hinder this great alliance must be firmly opposed.

In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao points out: "Subjectivist analysis of the political situation and subjectivist guidance of work will inevitably lead to either opportunism or adventurism." We deeply feel that if we make a subjectivist analysis of the situation, we cannot achieve the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, cannot unite the broad masses, but will be exploited by the class enemy. They will inevitably sow discord among us and create splits. As for a small group frequently seizing power, it is sheer adventurism. Even if power is seized, it cannot be consolidated.

After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work and engaging in a serious struggle against non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, all the warriors of the original Forward Brigade have united with the proletarian revolutionary factions of the entire school. In the future, we will definitely continue to wage a fierce struggle against "self" and achieve a broader great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, seize the power of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    革命派大联合是一场灭资兴无的思想斗争
    北京大学　林俊雄　谢有清
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命已进入“三结合”夺权的阶段。无产阶级革命派要完成毛主席交给我们的这个光荣任务，必须在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下联合起来，团结革命干部和广大革命群众，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军。在这个时候，我们北京大学原挺进兵团的战士们，重新学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉的著作。我们深深地感到毛主席在三十七年前说的话，就象昨天刚说过的一样亲切。这些话，象清泉一样涤荡着我们头脑里的各种非无产阶级思想的污垢。
    要夺权，就必须实行无产阶级革命派的大联合。在这个问题上，我们原挺进兵团也存在着各种错误认识。有的战士说：“我们兵团已打出去了，一联合，兵团的名字就取消了，心里就是舍不得。”也有的说：“要联合，我们再扩大一些人就可以了。”还有的干脆就说：“要夺权嘛，只要上面平均分配一下，我们兵团也去夺它一两个单位。”还有部分战士不愿跟自己有过争论的革命组织联合，总觉得人家这也有缺点，那也有错误，没有自己的兵团好，一联合岂不削弱了自己的战斗力？
    带着这些问题，我们对照毛主席的教导，在自己灵魂深处展开了一场“肉搏战”。大家认真地挖根源，认识到上述种种思想都是小团体主义、宗派主义、主观主义等小资产阶级思想在我们头脑中的反映，是极端有害的东西。不彻底清除它，就不可能使我们的队伍变成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍，就不可能实现无产阶级革命派的真正联合，就不可能完成夺权的战斗任务。正如毛主席所说：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义……。”毛主席的这些话一针见血地指出了小团体主义的实质就是个人主义，就是在我们的头脑里还有一个“私”字。有的战士说得好：现在，无产阶级革命派要大联合，要夺权，必须首先在我们的脑子里展开一场夺权的斗争！这就是要夺“私”字的权，大立“公”字的权。不破掉“私”字，要大立“公”字，就是一句空话。真正的无产阶级革命派，应该是眼光最远大，胸怀最宽阔，一个小团体算得了什么？我们的一切斗争，都是为了整个无产阶级的革命事业。我们要的是无产阶级革命派的大联合，是真正在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合。让那些同大联合水火不相容的小团体主义、宗派主义、风头主义，统统见鬼去吧！
    无产阶级革命派的大联合，是文化大革命发展的必然趋势，一切妨碍这种大联合的错误倾向都必须坚决反对。
    毛主席在这篇光辉的著作中指出：“对于政治形势的主观主义的分析和对于工作的主观主义的指导，其必然的结果，不是机会主义，就是盲动主义。”我们深刻地体会到，如果我们对形势作了主观主义的分析，就不能实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，不能团结广大群众，反而会被阶级敌人所利用。他们必然地要在我们中间挑拨离间，制造分裂。至于一个小团体动辄去夺权，更是十足的盲动主义，即使夺了权，也是不能巩固的。
    我们原挺进兵团的全体战士，在反复学习了毛主席的这篇光辉著作，同我们头脑里的非无产阶级思想进行了严肃的斗争后，已经同全校的无产阶级革命派联合起来。今后，我们一定继续狠斗“私”字，实现更大范围的无产阶级革命派的大联合，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
