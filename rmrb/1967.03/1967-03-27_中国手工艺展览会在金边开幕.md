The Chinese Handicraft Exhibition Opens in Phnom Penh

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 25th, the Handicraft and Art Exhibition of the People's Republic of China, organized by the Cambodia-China Friendship Association, opened on the 25th in Phnom Penh.

Chairman Lan Neth of the Cambodia-China Friendship Association spoke at the opening ceremony. He said: "Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Head of State of Cambodia, has often mentioned the following words: 'China is our number one friend. The friendship between our two countries is unbreakable. No matter what happens, the government and people of Cambodia will always be the most reliable and loyal friends of the Chinese people.' Lan Neth pointed out that these words express the extremely sincere feelings of the six million Cambodian people towards the seven hundred million Chinese brothers. He said that Cambodia and China have a long history of friendly relations. Today, this relationship is becoming stronger and stronger, 'because we are determined to fight together against our common enemy, against all imperialist and colonialist countries and their leader, the American imperialists.'"

Bin Nu, the private advisor to the Head of State of Cambodia, cut the ribbon for the exhibition to the sound of enthusiastic applause.

The exhibition features embroidery, paper-cutting artworks, furniture, ivory and jade sculptures, and lacquerware, totaling 627 items.

In the first exhibition hall, there hangs a three-meter-high, two-and-a-half-meter-wide embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao. Many visitors, with hearts full of admiration, stood in front of this portrait for a long time, unwilling to leave. Some visitors, upon seeing the ceramic sculptures reflecting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and seeing various sculptures reflecting the Chinese people reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, said that these exhibits reflect the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for the people's actions.

    中国手工艺展览会在金边开幕
    据新华社金边二十五日电　由柬埔寨中国友好协会主办的中华人民共和国手工艺和艺术品展览会二十五日在金边开幕。
    柬中友好协会主席兰·涅特在开幕式上讲了话。他说：柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王在很多场合谈到过这样一段话：“中国是我们的头号朋友。我们两国之间的友谊是牢不可破的。不管发生什么情况，柬埔寨政府和人民永远是中国人民最可靠和最忠实的朋友。”兰·涅特指出，这些话表达了六百万柬埔寨人民对七亿兄弟的中国人民怀有的极其真挚的感情。他说，柬埔寨和中国有着悠久的友好关系。今天，这种关系正在日益加强，“因为我们决心为反对我们的共同敌人，为反对一切帝国主义和殖民主义国家及其头目美帝国主义者而共同斗争。”
    柬埔寨国家元首私人顾问宾努在热烈的鼓掌声中为展览会剪了彩。
    展览会上展出了刺绣，剪纸艺术品，家具，象牙和玉制雕像，漆器等，共有六百二十七件。
    在第一展览室里悬挂着一幅三米高、两米半宽的毛主席彩色刺绣像，许多观众怀着爱戴的心情，站在这幅画像面前久久不愿离开。一些观众看到反映亚、非、拉美人民的革命斗争的陶制雕像，看到反映中国人民读毛主席的书、听毛主席的话、照毛主席的指示办事的各种雕像时说，这些展品反映了毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想是人民的行动指南。
