Strengthening militia construction is a consistent strategic idea of our great leader Chairman Mao. Since the founding of the nation, Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed that we must establish militia divisions and achieve universal military training, ensuring that militia work is implemented in terms of organization, politics, and military affairs. At any time and under any circumstances, we must steadfastly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered a critical phase where the revolutionary masses are seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. In this sharp and complex class struggle, the importance of militia work has not diminished but has increased; the tasks of the militia have not lightened but have become heavier; the role of the militia has not diminished but has become greater. All militia members across the country should resolutely carry out the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's instructions on militia work, and adhere to the requirements of the Central Military Commission based on Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution, promote preparedness, work, and production. We must fully play our role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. This power organ is best named the Revolutionary Committee. The editorial in the fifth issue of the 1967 "Red Flag" magazine, "On the Revolutionary 'Three-in-One Combination,'" states: "From top to bottom, in all units where power is to be seized, military representatives or militia representatives must participate to form the 'three-in-one combination.' This applies to factories, rural areas, commerce, finance, education (primary, secondary, and higher education), Party and government agencies, and mass organizations. Military representatives should be sent to the county level and above, and militia representatives should be sent to the commune level and below. This is very good." The militia participating in the power struggle through the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, trust, and encouragement for us. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's concern and trust and must resolutely complete this new and glorious political task. We must firmly unite with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, fight together, actively participate in the proletarian revolutionary power struggle, actively participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon for safeguarding the fruits of the people's revolution and for opposing the plots of restoration by internal and external enemies. We must firmly grasp this weapon." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolutionary mass movement and an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. The class enemies at home and abroad are scheming to create disturbances and sabotage. To ensure the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The militia is an important tool of the proletarian dictatorship, a mass revolutionary armed force, and a powerful auxiliary and reserve force for the People's Liberation Army. The broad masses of militia members must not only actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but also vigilantly and bravely defend it. The militia must, together with the People's Liberation Army, enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses, and be ready at any time to smash the counter-revolutionary tide launched by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We must work closely with the public security organs to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We must remain highly vigilant against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, seriously strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to annihilate any invading enemy.

Our great leader Chairman Mao calls on us to "seize the revolution and promote production." The "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao state: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at making people's thinking revolutionary, thereby making all work done better, faster, and more efficiently." We militia members must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call and actively implement the "Sixteen Points," resolutely fight against those who sabotage "seizing the revolution and promoting production," be both revolutionary vanguards and production models, and better play our role in production, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. The most urgent task in the countryside at present is to ensure a good spring plowing season. Ensuring a good spring plowing season this year is a top priority that affects the entire year's agricultural production, relates to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and is crucial for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a serious political struggle. Chairman Mao has always taught us that all rural work "must pay attention to the seasons" and "must not violate agricultural timeliness." The broad masses of militia members in the countryside must, with a sense of urgency, take the lead in launching the spring plowing season, and lay a solid foundation for achieving a bumper harvest for the entire year. Militia members in industry and transportation must also summon up revolutionary enthusiasm, take the lead in production, and strive to complete and overfulfill the state plan for each month and quarter with high quality.

To complete these important and glorious tasks, the most fundamental requirement for the militia is to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must study "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" as our guiding principles, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, enhance our awareness of carrying out the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and solve various complex problems encountered in the struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we must carry out a thorough revolution in our souls, break down selfishness, and uphold selflessness, overcoming tendencies such as individualism, sectarianism, anarchism, liberalism, and opportunism, and enhancing our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, becoming true proletarian revolutionaries.

Comrades in the militia, comrades in the people's armed forces, let us raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to complete the important and glorious tasks entrusted to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, fully utilize the role of the militia, and make the greatest contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Let us, through the execution and completion of these tasks, further temper and improve ourselves, promote the proletarianization and combat readiness of the militia forces, and make the three implementations of militia work even better!

### 充分发挥民兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的作用

    充分发挥民兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的作用
    加强民兵建设，是我们伟大统帅毛主席的一贯的战略思想。建国以来，毛主席先后多次指示，要大办民兵师，实现全民皆兵，民兵工作要做到组织、政治、军事三落实。我们在任何时候，任何情况下，都要坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的这些指示。
    当前，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，进入了无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的关键时刻。在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，民兵工作的重要性不是降低了，而是提高了；民兵的任务不是减轻了，而是加重了；民兵的作用不是小了，而是更大了。全国广大民兵都应该坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，遵照毛主席历来对民兵工作的指示，遵照中央军委根据毛主席指示提出的抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产的要求，充分发挥自己在无产阶级文化大革命中的作用。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期社论《论革命的“三结合”》指出：“从上至下，凡要夺权的单位，都要有军队代表或民兵代表参加，组成‘三结合’。不论工厂、农村、财贸、文教（大、中、小学）、党政机关及民众团体都要这样做。县以上都派军队代表，公社以下都派民兵代表，这是非常之好的。”民兵在夺权斗争中参加革命的“三结合”，这是毛主席对我们民兵的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞。我们决不能辜负毛主席的关怀和信任，一定要最坚决地完成这一项新的重大而又光荣的政治任务。我们要坚定地和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，积极参加无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，积极参加革命的“三结合”，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”无产阶级文化大革命，是一场空前伟大的革命群众运动，是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，国内外的阶级敌人正在处心积虑地阴谋进行捣乱和破坏。为了保证无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，必须加强无产阶级专政。民兵是无产阶级专政的重要工具，是群众性的革命武装，是人民解放军的有力助手和强大后备力量。广大民兵不仅要积极地参加无产阶级文化大革命，而且要警惕地、英勇地保卫无产阶级文化大革命。民兵要同人民解放军一起，热烈响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，随时准备粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所掀起的反革命逆流。要大力协同公安机关，坚决镇压地、富、反、坏、右分子的反革命活动。要对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派保持高度警惕，认真地加强战备，随时准备配合人民解放军消灭敢于来犯的敌人。
    伟大的统帅毛主席号召我们要“抓革命，促生产”。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”我们民兵一定要最热烈地响应毛主席的号召，最积极地执行“十六条”，坚决和那些破坏“抓革命，促生产”的坏家伙们进行斗争，既当革命的闯将，又当生产的模范，更好地发挥自己在生产中的突击作用，推动工农业生产的发展。当前农村最紧迫的任务是搞好春耕生产。搞好今年的春耕生产，这是关系到全年农业生产的收成，关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行的头等大事。这是一场严重的政治斗争。毛主席历来教导我们，一切农村工作“必须注意季节”，要“不违农时”。农村广大民兵一定要用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，积极带头打响春耕生产第一炮，为夺取全年农业大丰收奠定一个好基础。工业交通战线上的民兵，也一定要鼓足革命干劲，带头搞好生产，为每月每季都高质量地完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
    民兵要完成这些重大而又光荣的任务，最根本的一条，就是要更好地活学活用毛主席著作。我们要把“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》作为座右铭来学，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，提高执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，按照毛主席的教导来解决斗争中遇到的各种错综复杂的问题。用毛泽东思想做武器，搞好灵魂深处的革命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，克服个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义、自由主义、风头主义等不良倾向，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，当一个真正的无产阶级革命派。
    民兵同志们，人民武装干部同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力完成毛主席和党中央交给我们的重大而又光荣的任务，充分发挥民兵的作用，为无产阶级文化大革命作出最大的贡献！让我们通过执行和完成这些任务，进一步锻炼和提高自己，促进民兵队伍的非常无产阶级化和非常战斗化，把民兵工作三落实搞得更好！　
                                         （三月十六日）
