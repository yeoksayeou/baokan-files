The South Vietnamese Liberation Army Fights Well

In the first three months of this year, the armed forces of South Vietnam have waged arduous and heroic battles. This heroic army has demonstrated the immense power of people's war, fighting many brilliant battles. Apart from crushing a series of large-scale "sweeps" launched by the U.S. aggressors, they have recently taken the initiative to launch frequent attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and achieving glorious victories.

The U.S. Empire Struggles Desperately, Expanding the War of Aggression

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will not deviate from this logic."

In the dry and rainy seasons of last year, the U.S. aggressors, the puppet army of South Vietnam, and the mercenary forces suffered heavy losses of 340,000 personnel, including nearly 110,000 American casualties.

The U.S. aggressors are not willing to accept their defeat. Since the beginning of this year, U.S. President Johnson has dispatched a large number of personnel to engage in "peace talks" conspiracies, and the leaders of the Soviet revisionists have also been busy coordinating efforts. Under the cover of these "peace talks," the U.S. has launched a rampant campaign to expand the war in South Vietnam. Since November of last year, the U.S. has increased its troops in South Vietnam by about 80,000, bringing the total to 427,000. Compared to the same period last year, the number of aircraft has increased by 50%, and the artillery has tripled. In the first three months of this year, the U.S. aggressors have significantly intensified their military operations.

In this year's "dry season offensive," the U.S. aggressors have almost mobilized all their mobile forces, focusing on the liberation zones in the provinces of West Ninh, Tuyen Duc, the Central Highlands, and the southern part of the demilitarized zone in Quang Tri and Thua Thien. This "sweep" is the largest in scale and the longest in duration compared to the "dry season offensive" of 1965-1966.

The U.S. aims to use its massive forces in repeated "sweeps" to force the main forces of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army into a decisive battle, hoping to change its predicament of being bogged down and suffering continuous defeats in South Vietnam. Before the Guam conference, the U.S. had already carried out a series of activities to expand the war, and at the Guam conference, they further planned to escalate the aggression in Vietnam.

On the surface, the U.S. aggressors seem formidable, but in reality, they are all bark and no bite. Western news agencies have revealed that even high-ranking officers in the U.S. military headquarters view these "sweeps" as "huge gambles," constantly fearing "heavy losses." This fully exposes the psychological state of a desperate gambler and the true nature of a paper tiger.

The South Vietnamese Military and People Fight Flexibly, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the U.S.

The heroic people of South Vietnam and the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, in the first quarter of this year's anti-"sweep" struggle, overcame countless difficulties and firmly grasped the initiative in the war, inflicting heavy losses on the U.S. aggressors and crushing their "sweeps" one by one.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has adopted flexible strategies and tactics. As soon as the U.S. aggressors enter the liberated areas, they are like falling into a maze, unable to find the liberation army. Relying on the people, the liberation army moves secretly and swiftly, catching the enemy off guard and gradually wiping out the U.S. aggressors. A Japanese reporter who accompanied the U.S. troops into West Ninh Province reported that although the U.S. had done "highly secretive work" before the attack, the liberation army was "very mobile" and had already moved away in an orderly manner by the time the U.S. arrived. Another Japanese newspaper reported that the liberation army was "highly mobile," and every time the U.S. troops arrived, the liberation army had already retreated. The people's armed forces have fully demonstrated the characteristics of bravery, flexibility, and proficiency in close combat and night operations. They frequently launch counterattacks at favorable times and places, annihilating a large number of enemy troops and putting the enemy in a passive position of taking blows.

Since January, the military and people of various provinces in South Vietnam have launched extensive anti-"sweep" struggles. Especially in February, from Quang Tri to Can Tho, the liberation forces in various base areas launched frequent attacks. The provinces of Tuyen Duc and the Mekong Delta have quickly organized new offensives after crushing an enemy "sweep." In the demilitarized zone of Quang Tri Province, although the U.S. aggressors have stationed tens of thousands of troops, they have been continuously defeated by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army over the past few months. Western newspapers admit that in some areas, the main forces of the U.S. aggressors have been "pinned down" and "unable to move."

In the first quarter of this year, the local forces and guerrilla units of the South Vietnamese people have been more active. From Quang Tri to Can Tho, guerrilla units in vast areas have taken the initiative to launch attacks in small groups, playing a significant role. The guerrillas, with high morale and clever fighting skills, have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. The guerrillas in the Chanh An area of Gia Dinh Province set up extensive minefields, annihilating more than 200 U.S. aggressors and destroying 54 armored vehicles in a single battle. In another battle, this guerrilla unit annihilated more than 100 U.S. troops, shot down 8 helicopters, and sank 2 landing craft. The extensive minefields and traps set up by the people in West Ninh Province have also played a significant role. Western newspapers reported that mines and traps caused heavy casualties among the U.S. troops participating in this "sweep." In addition, in recent months, many areas originally guarded by puppet troops, such as outposts and road patrols, have been taken over by U.S. troops. They have all become targets for widespread attacks by local guerrilla forces.

While the military and people in the liberated base areas are bravely fighting against the "sweeps," the South Vietnamese Liberation Army has continuously entered enemy-occupied areas to conduct external line operations. They have systematically attacked U.S. command centers, barracks, logistics bases, airfields, and transportation facilities, achieving successful raids. These brave and intelligent actions have caused significant losses to enemy personnel and equipment, effectively tying down U.S. aggressor forces. According to incomplete statistics, since February, the liberation forces have launched more than 40 fierce attacks on U.S. airfields and logistics bases such as Da Nang, Pleiku, Qui Nhon, Tuy Hoa, Vung Tau, Ban Me Thuot, and Long Binh. Among them, the Pleiku Air Base was attacked four times from January 6 to 10, Qui Nhon was attacked twice in less than a month, and the Long Binh logistics base has been attacked four times since the U.S. launched the "dry season offensive." On February 13, the liberation army artillery even penetrated into the Saigon city area, shelling the U.S. military headquarters in Vietnam. These attacks show that the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, after arduous battles, has become a revolutionary army with strong combat will and high tactical level. The U.S. military's lack of fighting spirit, dispersed forces, and desperate situation have been fully exposed.

The People's Armed Forces Achieve Glorious Victories, the Paper Tiger is in a Miserable State

After three months of fighting, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army has crushed a series of "sweeps" launched by the U.S. aggressors and has further taken the initiative to annihilate enemy troops, achieving glorious victories.

In the strategic area of West Ninh Province, from early February to mid-February, the liberation forces annihilated more than 1,000 U.S. troops, crushing the "sweep" by about 8,000 U.S. troops. Since February 22, the U.S. aggressors have mobilized more than 40,000 troops for an unprecedented large-scale "sweep." This is the largest "sweep" since the U.S. launched its aggression in Vietnam. Since early February, the military and people of West Ninh Province have annihilated more than 8,000 U.S. aggressors, destroyed a large number of tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles, and shot down a large number of helicopters. The anti-"sweep" battle in this area is still fiercely ongoing. The great victory in West Ninh fully demonstrates the South Vietnamese military and people's resolute will to defeat the U.S. aggressors. The South Vietnamese military and people's iron will, like a rock, cannot be subdued by any force and cannot be shaken by any conspiracy.

The military and people of Tuyen Duc and Gia Dinh Provinces, after nearly a month of fighting, crushed the large-scale "sweep" personally supervised by Westmoreland, annihilating more than 3,100 U.S. troops and destroying 204 military vehicles from January 2 to 29. Among them, 2,600 were annihilated in the Bo Giao District of Tuyen Duc Province. In less than a month, the liberation forces in this district conducted more than 270 battles.

The military and people in the vast areas of the Mekong Delta and the central region, in the first 20 days of this year, annihilated three puppet infantry battalions, one armored battalion, four companies, and 16 platoons. Afterwards, the liberation forces in this region launched extensive attacks, annihilating a large number of U.S. and puppet troops.

In addition, in the vast areas of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Quang Ngai, Kontum, Binh Dinh, and Binh Thuan Provinces, the liberation forces have launched extensive attacks, annihilating a large number of U.S., puppet, and mercenary troops.

In the past three months, the U.S. has increased its troops in South Vietnam under the cover of "peace talks" and has spared no effort to intensify military operations. However, apart from adding tens of thousands of American soldiers to its casualty list, the U.S. aggressors have gained nothing. A U.S. general recently admitted: "The U.S. military, of course, hopes to engage in a Stalingrad-style decisive battle with the Viet Cong. However, the reality is that the U.S. military's progress today can only be measured in centimeters, occupying one place today and losing another place tomorrow." This statement describes the U.S.'s current desperate struggle, passive defense, and helpless situation in South Vietnam.

Chairman Mao said: "After crossing the difficult path of war, the road to victory will open up, this is the natural logic of war." The South Vietnamese military and people, who have persistently fought bravely for a long time, have created a great revolutionary situation. As long as the South Vietnamese people persist in the anti-American, national salvation war, firmly grasp the U.S. aggressors, and fight a protracted war with them, they will definitely be able to wear down and kill this beast, achieving ultimate and complete victory!

### 南越解放军打得好

    南越解放军打得好
    今年头三个月里，越南南方解放武装力量，进行了艰苦卓绝、气壮山河的战斗。这支英雄的部队发挥了人民战争的无比威力，打了许多漂亮仗，除了粉碎美国侵略者发动的一系列大规模“扫荡”之外，最近频频主动出击，连连歼敌，战果辉煌。
    美帝拚命挣扎，扩大战争冒险
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    在去年旱季和雨季，美国侵略军、南越伪军和仆从军遭到了三十四万人伤亡的重大损失，其中美军伤亡近十一万人。
    美国侵略者并不甘心它的失败。今年初以来，美国总统约翰逊派了大批人马，四出进行“和谈”阴谋活动，苏修头目也到处奔走进行配合。就在这个“和谈”的烟幕下，美帝在越南南方又进行了猖狂的扩大战争活动。从去年十一月“旱季攻势”以来，美帝在南越增兵八万人左右，总数达到四十二万七千人。和去年同期相比，飞机又增加了百分之五十，炮兵也增加了三倍。今年头三个月里，美国侵略者大大加强了军事行动。
    在今年的“旱季攻势”中，美国侵略军几乎动员了它全部机动兵力，以西宁省、土龙木省、中部高原地区和非军事区南侧的广治省和承天省的解放区根据地为重点，进行了广泛的“扫荡”。这次“扫荡”规模之大，战役持续时间之长，都超过了一九六五——一九六六年的“旱季攻势”。
    美国这次“旱季攻势”的目的，是妄想以巨大的兵力，在持续反复的“扫荡”中，迫使南越解放武装力量的主力同它进行决战，以便改变它陷在南越长期消耗、节节失败的困境。在这次关岛会议以前，美国早就进行了一系列的扩大战争的活动，在关岛会议上又订出了进一步扩大侵越战争的计划。
    从表面看，美国侵略者好象气势汹汹，实际上则是色厉内荏。西方通讯社透露，就连美国侵略军总部的高级指挥人员也把这些“扫荡”看为“巨大的冒险”，时刻担心“要付出很大损失”。这就充分暴露了一个输红了眼的赌徒的心理状态和外强中干的纸老虎的本质。
    南越军民机动灵活，痛歼美军
    英雄的南越人民和南越解放武装力量，在今年第一季度反“扫荡”斗争中，排除万难，牢牢地掌握住战争的主动权，大量杀伤美国侵略者，把敌人的“扫荡”一个个打得粉碎。
    南越解放武装力量采取了机动灵活的战略战术。美国侵略军一进入解放区，就象掉进了迷魂阵，根本找不着解放军。而解放军依靠群众，以秘密和神速的行动，出其不意地歼击敌人，一口一口地把美国侵略军吃掉，积小胜为大胜。随军进入西宁省的日本记者报道说，美军进攻前虽然“作了高度的保密工作”，但是解放军“很是机动，等美军到达时，早已秩序井然地转移”。日本报纸在另一篇报道中说，解放军“机动灵活，每一次美军都象和解放军捉迷藏，等美军开到，解放军早已撤退”。而人民武装力量则充分发挥了人民军队勇敢、灵活和善于近战夜战的特长，在有利的时机和地点，频繁地进行反击，歼灭了敌人大量有生力量，使敌人陷于被动挨打的处境。
    从一月份以来，南越各省军民即展开了广泛的反“扫荡”斗争。特别在二月份，从广治到金瓯，各个根据地的解放武装都进行了频繁的出击。土龙木省、湄公河三角洲各省在粉碎敌人一次“扫荡”以后，迅速组织了新的攻势。在非军事区的广治省一带，美国侵略者虽然囤兵数万，但是，几个月来，一直被南越解放武装力量打得损兵折将。西方报刊承认，在若干地区，美国侵略者的主力部队已被“钉紧”而“无法动弹”。
    在今年第一季度内南越人民地方部队和游击队更为活跃。从广治到金瓯广大地区的游击队，以小部队到处主动出击，发挥了巨大作用。游击队以高昂的士气和巧妙的斗争艺术给予敌人严重的杀伤。嘉定省忠安地区的游击队大摆地雷阵，在一次战斗中就消灭了美国侵略军二百多人，毁伤战车五十四辆。在另一次战斗中，这支游击队又消灭了美军一百多人，击落直升飞机八架，击沉登陆艇两艘。西宁省广大人民群众摆设的地雷阵、陷阱也发挥了巨大作用。西方报纸报道，地雷和陷阱造成参加这次“扫荡”的美军大量伤亡。另外，在最近几个月中，许多地区原来由伪军担任的据点、公路守备任务，都由美军接替。他们都成了各地游击武装广泛出击的目标。
    在解放区根据地军民英勇进行反“扫荡”的同时，南越解放军连续进入敌占区，进行外线作战，有计划地对美国侵略军的指挥机关、兵营、后勤基地、飞机场和交通设施等等，进行成功的奇袭。这一英勇机智的行动，使敌军人员、器材遭到重大损失，有力地牵制了美国侵略军兵力。据不完全统计，从二月份以来，解放武装力量先后对岘港、波来古、朱莱、茶古、永隆、芽庄、边和、龙平等美军机场和后勤基地进行了四十多次猛烈的袭击。其中波来古空军基地从一月六日到十日，连续遭到四次攻击，朱莱在不到一个月时间中，遭到两次袭击，龙平后勤基地从美军发动“旱季攻势”以来也被攻击了四次。二月十三日，解放军炮兵更深入到西贡市区，炮击侵越美军总部。这些袭击表明，南越解放武装力量在艰苦战斗中，已经锻炼成一支具有坚强的战斗意志和高度战术水平的革命军队。美军士无斗志、兵力分散、捉襟见肘的窘态也暴露无遗。
    人民武装战果辉煌　纸老虎狼狈不堪
    经过三个月奋战，南越解放武装力量已经粉碎了美国侵略者发动的一系列“扫荡”，而且进一步主动出击，消灭敌军，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    在战略要地西宁省，从二月初到二月中，解放武装力量歼灭美军一千多人，粉碎了美军约八千人所进行的“扫荡”。从二月二十二日起，美国侵略军又拼凑了四万多人进行了规模空前的“扫荡”。这是美国发动侵越战争以来规模最大的一次“扫荡”战。从二月初以来，西宁省军民一共消灭了八千多名美国侵略军，击毁大量的坦克、装甲车及其他军用车辆，击落大批直升飞机。目前，这个地区的反“扫荡”战斗仍在激烈进行中。西宁大捷充分显示了南越军民决心战胜美国侵略者的坚强意志。南越军民这一坚如磐石的钢铁意志，是任何力量也屈服不了，任何阴谋手段也动摇不了的。
    土龙木省和嘉定省军民经过近一个月的战斗，粉碎了由威斯特摩兰亲自监督的大规模“扫荡”，从一月二日到二十九日消灭美军三千一百多人，毁伤军车二百零四辆。其中有二千六百多人是在土龙木省边葛县被消灭的。在不到一个月内，解放武装力量在这个县进行了二百七十多次战斗。
    湄公河三角洲和中部中区广大军民，在今年头二十天中，全歼伪军三个步兵营、一个装甲营、四个连和十六个排。此后，这个地区的解放武装力量又进行了广泛出击，消灭了大量美伪军。
    另外，在广治、承天、广义、昆嵩、平定、边和等省广大地区，解放武装力量都进行了广泛出击，消灭了大批美伪军和帮凶军。
    三个月来，美国在“和谈”烟幕下不断向南越增兵，并且竭尽全力，加强军事行动。但是，美国侵略者除了在它的死伤名单上新增加数以万计的美国大兵以外，什么也没有捞到。美国一位将军在不久以前供认说：“美军当然希望同越共进行斯大林格勒式的决战。但是，实际情形则是美军今天的进展只能以厘米计，今天占了这个地方，明天失掉另一个地方”。这段话描绘出美国今天在南越心情焦急，拚命挣扎，被动挨打，毫无办法的狼狈处境。
    毛主席说：“跨过战争的艰难路程之后，胜利的坦途就到来了，这是战争的自然逻辑。”坚持长期英勇斗争的越南南方军民，已经打出一个大好的革命形势。南越人民只要坚持抗美救国战争，揪住美国侵略者不放，同它持久而战，就一定能够把美国侵略者这只野兽拖垮、拖死，取得最后的彻底的胜利！
