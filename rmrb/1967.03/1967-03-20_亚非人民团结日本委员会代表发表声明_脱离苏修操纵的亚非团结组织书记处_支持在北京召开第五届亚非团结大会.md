Representatives of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee of Japan Issue a Statement

	Separate from the Secretariat of the Asian-African Solidarity Organization Manipulated by the Soviet Revisionists

	Support the Fifth Asian-African Solidarity Conference to be Held in Beijing

	Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 18th - On the 15th, representatives of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, Kitazawa Masao and his wife, issued a statement in Cairo. They condemned the Soviet modern revisionists for manipulating the Nicosia meeting to create divisions; supported the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winnipeg to convene the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year; and announced their separation from the permanent secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo, which is manipulated by the Soviet revisionists.

	The statement said: "Kitazawa Masao and his wife, Kitazawa Yo, who have been working in the secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo and in the Women's Bureau of this organization, have decided to separate from this secretariat."

	The statement pointed out: "The so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting held in Nicosia in February under the manipulation of the Soviet modern revisionists was a divisive meeting. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, with Professor Banboku Toshimatsu as its chairman, had refused to participate in this meeting."

	The statement condemned the Nicosia meeting for violating the "resolutions on political and organizational aspects adopted at the Winnipeg Conference, trampling on the spirit and lofty principles of the Asian-African movement, and thus proving that this meeting was illegal."

	The statement said: "The secretariat that implements the illegal resolutions of the Nicosia meeting can only be considered illegal. Therefore, we find no reason to continue working in this secretariat."

	The statement expressed that Kitazawa Masao and his wife will continue to "strive to strengthen the Asian-African movement under the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, firmly uphold the resolutions of the Winnipeg Conference, and through all possible means, closely cooperate with patriots and freedom fighters."

	The statement finally emphasized that for the peoples of various countries who yearn for thorough national liberation, successfully holding the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing is of extremely great significance.

    亚非人民团结日本委员会代表发表声明
    脱离苏修操纵的亚非团结组织书记处
    支持在北京召开第五届亚非团结大会
    新华社开罗十八日电　亚非人民团结日本委员会代表北泽政雄和他的夫人十五日在这里发表声明，谴责苏联现代修正主义者操纵尼科西亚会议，制造分裂；支持温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议；同时，他们宣布和苏修操纵的开罗亚非人民团结组织常设书记处脱离关系。
    声明说：“分别在亚非人民团结组织设在开罗的书记处和这一组织的妇女局工作的北泽政雄和北泽洋子夫人决定脱离这一书记处。”
    声明指出：“今年二月份在苏联现代修正主义者操纵下、在尼科西亚召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议是一次分裂性会议。以坂本德松教授为理事长的亚非人民团结日本委员会曾经拒绝参加这次会议。”
    声明谴责尼科西亚会议破坏了温尼巴大会上“通过的关于政治方面和组织方面的决议，践踏了亚非运动的精神和崇高的原则，从而证明这次会议是非法的。”
    声明说：“执行尼科西亚会议的非法决议的书记处只能被认为是非法的。因此，我们找不出理由继续在这一书记处工作。”
    声明表示，北泽政雄和他的夫人将坚持不懈地“致力于加强在反帝反修鲜明旗帜下的亚非运动，坚决维护温尼巴大会的决议，通过一切可能的途径同爱国者和自由战士密切合作。”
    声明最后强调指出，对于渴望取得彻底的民族解放的各国人民来说，在北京成功地举行第五届亚非人民团结大会具有极其重大的意义。
