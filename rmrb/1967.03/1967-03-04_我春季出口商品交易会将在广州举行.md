The spring session of the China Export Commodities Fair will be held from April 15 to May 15 in Guangzhou.

The organizing committee has recently sent out invitations to business circles worldwide, warmly welcoming them to participate in this fair.

The upcoming fair is being held at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered a new stage and socialist economic construction is thriving. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. The spiritual face of the Chinese people has never been as vigorous and full of fighting spirit as it is today. By resolutely implementing the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have greatly promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production, thereby providing a more solid material foundation for our country's foreign trade.

This fair will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and, in accordance with the principle of "equality and mutual benefit, mutual need and supply," engage in trade with businesspeople from all over the world, selling various commodities for export from our country and purchasing various materials needed for our country's socialist construction and the people's livelihood. It will make new contributions to further developing normal trade relations between our country and countries and regions around the world, strengthening mutual understanding, and promoting friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world.
