Comrade Jiang Qing also gave important instructions at the meeting.

	Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the meeting: The great Red Guards movement, which started from the middle schools in Beijing, immediately received the enthusiastic support of our most respected leader Chairman Mao and rapidly developed. Especially after Chairman Mao received you on August 18 last year, the revolutionary Red Guards, with sky-high spirits, marched from schools to society, from Beijing to the nation, everywhere linking up, fanning the winds of socialism, and igniting the fires of the Cultural Revolution. You destroyed the remnants of the old world left behind by the exploiting classes, and made great contributions to China's proletarian cultural revolution by establishing the new four elements of the proletariat.

	Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out: You responded to Chairman Mao's call to embark on a long march on foot, endured wind and rain, saw the world, and tempered yourselves in great storms and waves. You actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and firmly fought against the reactionary bloodline theory and the actions of the reactionary organization "联动" within your ranks. The actions of this small number of people cannot erase the great achievements of the Red Guards. You criticized and struck down this reactionary ideology and action, making your ranks even healthier and stronger.

	Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a call to you to resume classes and make revolution. We are glad to see that you have already taken active action. We hope that while you are in class, you will also work hard to rectify, achieve revolutionary unity, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. You should mainly educate yourselves; at the same time, we also hope that you will humbly learn from the revolutionary older brothers and sisters in colleges and universities, from revolutionary workers and peasants, and from our PLA comrades.

	Comrade Zhou Enlai finally said excitedly: Today, seeing you united, united, and gathered together, I feel very happy. Your ideological and fighting levels have been greatly improved compared to the past. Chairman Mao said: "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the end it is yours.... The future is bright, the future is yours." The future of the motherland is bright, and the future of the world is also bright. I hope you will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

	Comrade Jiang Qing, on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extended warm congratulations to the revolutionary youngsters.

	She pointed out: Beijing's middle schools are the birthplace of the Red Guards movement. When the Red Guards first appeared, our great leader Chairman Mao supported this new thing with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for the revolutionary youngsters, and it is also the greatest glory of the revolutionary youngsters. You should cherish this glory and protect this glory.

	She said: The revolutionary Red Guards fighters are the vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution. You have broken through the resistance of the bourgeois reactionary line, smashed the old four elements of the exploiting classes, and established the new four elements of the proletariat. You have used Chairman Mao's class analysis viewpoint to criticize the reactionary bloodline theory of the exploiting classes and have firmly fought against the reactionary organization "联动." You have firmly resisted and criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and actively implemented and propagated the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary Red Guards have created immortal merits in the proletarian cultural revolution. This is something that no one can erase. We hope that the revolutionary Red Guards will be humble and avoid arrogance, develop their strengths and overcome their weaknesses, and make new contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution.

	Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out: At present, the task of the middle school Red Guards is to actively respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, return to their schools, resume classes, and make revolution. While in class, they should also make revolution. Relying on the broad revolutionary teachers and students in middle schools, they should firmly implement the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. According to the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" and the "Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Middle Schools," they should carry out struggle, criticism, and reform, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools through to the end. The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue. To complete this glorious and arduous task, Red Guards must, in the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out rectification studies, rectify their thoughts, rectify their style, and rectify their organization. We hope you will humbly learn from the PLA, break down individualism, establish collectivism, overcome sectarianism, individualism, liberalism, and other tendencies, and strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, further realize and consolidate the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces and build a highly proletarianized and combat-ready revolutionary force.

	Comrade Jiang Qing emphasized: The proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolutionary movement in the new stage of socialist revolution in our country. Only by achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces and uniting the broad masses can the proletarian cultural revolution achieve thorough victory. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that we must implement Marx's saying that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself, and we must strive to unite all those who can be united.

	She asked the Red Guards fighters to definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly treat teachers and cadres, and conduct class analysis on them. The practice of indiscriminately rejecting, opposing, and overthrowing teachers and cadres is wrong. This wrong practice is the advocacy of those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line. Most of the teachers and cadres in middle schools are good or relatively good. We only need to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a small number of unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the ranks of teachers and staff. For revolutionary teachers and cadres, we should support them. For those who have made mistakes, we must adopt the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," help them correct their mistakes, and bring them back to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao.

	Comrade Jiang Qing said: For comrades who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and made some mistakes, we should patiently arouse their class consciousness, warmly help them correct their mistakes, and unite with them to resume classes and make revolution. We should not discriminate against them, reject them, or fight against them. We should work with them to carry out rectification studies, starting from the desire for unity, using the method of unity-criticism-unity, to help them return to the correct path. In this way, we can isolate the few who insist on reactionary ideas and engage in looting, smashing, and robbing, and expose them to the broad masses under the sun. For individual serious criminals, they can be dealt with by the public security organs according to law.

	Comrade Jiang Qing said: To achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces in middle schools and to develop and strengthen our leftist forces, we must adhere to Chairman Mao's class line. In our revolutionary ranks, Chairman Mao and our Party have always opposed both ignoring class origins and "class originism." Only by adhering to Chairman Mao's class line and gradually uniting the majority of students, teachers, and cadres can we thoroughly overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a small number of unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the ranks of teachers and staff. We must pay attention to the methods of struggle and strictly implement the various policies formulated by the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao. We must engage in ideological struggle and not physical struggle.

	Comrade Jiang Qing said: Your school's proletarian cultural revolution is part of the overall proletarian cultural revolution and is inseparable from the overall proletarian cultural revolution. I hope that while you are in school, you will have a national and global perspective. Currently, whether it is the international situation, the domestic situation, the situation of the Cultural Revolution, or the situation of industrial and agricultural production, it is all a great situation. Of course, all the exploiting classes and their representatives are unwilling to exit the historical stage. The struggle is bound to be tortuous and winding. The development of the proletarian cultural revolution is uneven, but the overall situation is good. You should be inspired by the great situation and, with the spirit of caring about national and international affairs, carry the proletarian cultural revolution in your school through to the end.

	Comrade Jiang Qing finally said earnestly: You are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. I hope you will always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Strive to reform yourselves and temper yourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	That day, the Great Hall of the People was filled with a vibrant atmosphere. The revolutionary youngsters waved their red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," facing the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and shouted in unison: "Long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao! Long live!" The giant banner hanging in the venue read: "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!"

	The meeting began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." The revolutionary youngsters, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, the Party, the people, and Mao Zedong Thought, read aloud the quotations from Chairman Mao in unison.

	The meeting passed a letter of respect to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. The letter of respect said: Our most beloved and respected Red Commander, please rest assured that under your guidance, we have undergone the baptism of battle, and we will definitely be able to withstand greater storms and tests. Gunfire and shelling will not scare us, sugar-coated bullets will not knock us down, and tricks will not deceive us. We have firm beliefs, we have the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, we have the great aspirations and heroic spirit of the proletariat to revolutionize to the end. We will not be like the ephemeral flowers in history, we will be the rustless revolutionary screws that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the people of the world revolution wholeheartedly.

	The meeting passed the "Declaration of the Beijing Middle School Red Guards Representative Assembly," which solemnly proclaimed:

	Our supreme commander is the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao.

	Our guiding ideology is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	We are the strongest reserve force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Our organizational principle is democratic centralism.

	Following this, the meeting passed the "Letter from the Beijing Middle School Red Guards Representative Assembly to All Middle School Red Guards in the Country."

	The "Letter from the Beijing Middle School Red Guards Representative Assembly to All Middle School Red Guards in the Country" emphasized: Chairman Mao teaches us: Implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself. We must seriously understand and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic thought, correctly implement the Party's class line, firmly rely on the revolutionary leftists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and thoroughly isolate and strike the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

	Representatives of the united organizations of the proletarian revolutionary forces in Beijing middle schools made a joint speech at the meeting. With hearts full of excitement, they respectfully wished the great leader Chairman Mao a long life! They warmly welcomed the growth and strengthening of the middle school Red Guards under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. They pointed out: The convening of the Middle School Red Guards Representative Assembly is only the first step of a long march, and more arduous tasks await us. They said, no matter how tortuous the road is, no matter how many risks there are in the process of advancement, we will always firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The joint speech concluded: Dear Chairman Mao! It is you who have entrusted the future of China and the world to us young people. We will definitely not disappoint your expectations and will resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end! We will definitely let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly all over the world!

	Among the speakers at the meeting was a representative of overseas Chinese students from Beijing middle schools, one of the 41 overseas Chinese youths who returned to the motherland after a fierce and tenacious struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries. He said: The proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary movement to prevent capitalist restoration, uproot the roots of revisionism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our country will never change color.

	Representatives of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, and the Beijing Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army successively spoke, expressing their determination to be the strong backbone of the Red Guards fighters, to unite and fight with the Red Guards fighters, and to win together. They resolutely repel the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

	Comrade Li Zhongqi, Deputy Commander of the Beijing Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke on behalf of all officers and soldiers, saying: We are deeply convinced that after this meeting, the proletarian revolutionary forces in the middle schools of the capital will definitely hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao, and make new contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution.

	Representatives of the Beijing Higher Education Institutions Red Guards Representative Assembly and the Shanghai Middle Schools Red Guards also attended the meeting to extend warm fraternal congratulations.

	The meeting received many congratulatory letters from the proletarian revolutionary forces in the capital and various places in the country.

	The Beijing municipal leaders who attended the meeting included Comrades Wu De, Liu Jianxun, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Liu Fu, Li Zhongqi, Zhou Jingfang, Gao Yangwen, Ding Guoyu, and Li Qingquan.

    几十万革命小将在伟大统帅毛主席身边团结起来，联合起来
    首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会成立
    周恩来同志代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组，到会热烈祝贺，并作了重要指示。陈伯达、康生、徐向前、叶剑英、谢富治、萧华、杨成武、江青等同志，也到会热烈祝贺。江青同志作了重要指示。
    代表们怀着永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于党、永远忠于人民、永远忠于毛泽东思想的赤诚之心，表示坚决响应毛主席号召，边上课，边整风，边战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    新华社二十六日讯　首都中等学校红卫兵革命小将，在最最敬爱的伟大统帅毛主席的身边，团结起来了，联合起来了。三月二十五日，在雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂里，一万多名中等学校的红卫兵代表隆重集会，宣布成立了自己新型的革命组织——首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会（中学红代会）。
    首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会是一个胜利团结的大会，战斗誓师的大会。首都中等学校几十万青少年革命闯将，将在中学红代会的统一组织下，进一步联合起来，热烈响应毛主席和党中央关于复课闹革命的伟大号召，在这个无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级决战的关键时刻，更好地发挥自己的战斗力，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，完成一斗、二批、三改的光荣的战斗任务，把中学无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组，到会热烈祝贺，并且作了重要指示。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志，中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组顾问康生同志，中共中央政治局委员、中央军委副主席、中央军委文革小组组长徐向前同志，中共中央政治局委员、中央军委副主席叶剑英同志，中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理谢富治同志，中共中央委员、中央军委文革小组副组长、中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华同志，中共中央候补委员、中央军委文革小组副组长、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武同志，中央文革小组第一副组长江青同志，以及中央文革小组成员王力同志、关锋同志、戚本禹同志和中央军委文革小组成员叶群同志，也到会热烈祝贺。江青同志还在会上作了重要指示。
    周恩来同志在大会上讲话时说：伟大的红卫兵运动从北京的中学兴起后，立即得到了我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席的热情支持，迅速地发展起来。尤其是在去年八月十八日毛主席接见了你们后，革命的红卫兵小将们，带着冲天的闯劲，从学校走向社会，从北京走向全国，到处串连，煽起社会主义的风，点起文化大革命的火。你们破剥削阶级的四旧，立无产阶级的四新，把旧世界遗留下来的残迹，打得个落花流水，为我国无产阶级文化大革命作出了伟大的贡献。
    周恩来同志指出：你们响应毛主席关于徒步长征的号召，经风雨，见世面，在大风大浪中锻炼，自己教育自己。你们活学活用毛主席著作，同自己队伍中一小部分人的反动血统论的思想，同反动组织“联动”的行动，进行了坚决的斗争。这一小部分人的所作所为，是绝对抹煞不了红卫兵的丰功伟绩的。你们批判和打击了这种反动的思想和行动，使你们的队伍更加健康壮大起来了。
    周恩来同志强调地说：毛主席和党中央向你们发出了复课闹革命的号召。我们高兴地看到，你们已经积极地行动起来。希望你们一面上课，一面努力整风，实行革命的大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。你们主要是自己教育自己；同时，也希望你们虚心地向大专院校革命的哥哥、姐姐们学习，向革命的工人和农民们学习，向我们的解放军同志们学习。
    周恩来同志最后兴奋地说：今天看到你们大联合、大团结、大会师，济济一堂，思想水平、斗争水平比过去更加提高了，感到非常高兴。毛主席说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。……希望寄托在你们身上。”祖国的前途无限光明，世界的前途也无限光明。希望你们高高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋勇前进吧！
    江青同志代表中央文革小组，向革命小将们致以热烈的祝贺。
    她指出：北京的中学是红卫兵运动的发源地。当红卫兵一开始出现的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，就以最大的革命热情支持了这一新生事物。这是毛主席对革命小将们的最大关怀，也是革命小将们的最大光荣。要珍惜这个光荣，要爱护这个光荣。
    她说：革命的红卫兵战士是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将。你们发扬敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命的精神，冲破资产阶级反动路线的阻力，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。你们运用毛主席的阶级分析观点，批判了剥削阶级的反动的血统论，对反动组织“联动”进行了坚决的斗争。你们坚决地抵制和批判了资产阶级反动路线，积极地执行和宣传了以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级革命路线。革命的红卫兵，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命中，创立了不朽的功勋。这是任何人都抹煞不了的。我们希望，革命的红卫兵要戒骄戒躁，发扬优点，克服缺点，为无产阶级文化大革命作出新的贡献。
    江青同志指出：当前，中学红卫兵小将们的任务，就是积极响应毛主席、党中央的号召，回到本校，复课闹革命。一边上课，一边搞革命。依靠中学的广大的革命师生，坚决执行以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。按照《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，按照《中共中央关于中学无产阶级文化大革命的意见》，进行斗、批、改，把中学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。为了完成这个光荣而又艰巨的任务，红卫兵战士必须在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，开展整风学习，整顿思想，整顿作风，整顿组织。我们希望你们虚心地向解放军学习，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，克服风头主义、山头主义、小团体主义、自由主义、个人主义等等，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。在毛泽东思想的基础上，进一步实现和巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合，建立一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍。
    江青同志强调地说：无产阶级文化大革命，是我国社会主义革命新阶段的伟大革命运动。只有实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，团结广大群众，无产阶级文化大革命才能取得彻底胜利。毛主席一再教导我们，必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己，要注意争取团结一切可以团结的人们。
    她要求红卫兵战士们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，正确地对待教师和干部，对他们要进行阶级分析。那种对教师和干部不分青红皂白，一概排斥，一概反对，一概打倒的作法，是错误的。这种错误作法就是提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人的主张。中学的教师和干部，大多数是好的和比较好的。我们要打倒的只是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以及一小部分混到教师职工队伍里的不肯改造的地、富、反、坏、右分子。对于革命的教师和干部，应该支持他们。对于犯错误的教师和干部，必须采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，帮助他们改正错误，使他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    江青同志说：对于受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽，而犯了一些错误的同学，应该耐心地启发他们的阶级觉悟，热情地帮助他们改正错误，团结他们一道复课闹革命。不应该歧视他们，排斥他们，更不应该对他们进行斗争，要和他们一道进行整风学习，从团结的愿望出发，采取团结——批评——团结的方法，帮助他们回到正确道路上来。这样就可以把极少数坚持反动思想的，专搞打、砸、抢的坏分子孤立起来，把他们暴露在广大群众的光天化日之下；对个别情节严重的犯罪分子，可以由公安部门依法处理。
    江青同志说：要实现中学无产阶级革命派大联合，要发展壮大我们的左派队伍，必须坚持毛主席的阶级路线。在我们的革命队伍里，毛主席和我们党从来都是既反对忽视阶级成份，又反对“唯成份论”的。只有坚持毛主席的阶级路线，逐步地团结学生、教师和干部的大多数，才能彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以及一小部分混到教师职工队伍里的不肯改造的地、富、反、坏、右分子。我们必须注意斗争方法，要不折不扣地执行以毛主席为首的党中央制定的各项政策。要文斗，不要武斗。
    江青同志说：你们学校的无产阶级文化大革命，是整个无产阶级文化大革命的一部分，是和整个无产阶级文化大革命分不开的。希望你们，身在学校，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。目前，不论国际形势，还是国内形势，不论文化大革命形势，还是工业农业生产形势，都是一片大好形势。当然一切剥削阶级以及它的代表人物都是不甘心退出历史舞台的。斗争是有反复的，是有曲折的。无产阶级文化大革命的发展是不平衡的，但是总的形势是大好的。你们应该在大好形势的鼓舞下，以关心国家大事和世界大事的精神，把本校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    江青同志最后殷切地说：你们是毛主席的红卫兵。希望你们永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，努力改造自己，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。
    这一天，人民大会堂洋溢着一派蓬勃朝气。革命小将们挥动红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，面对伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，齐声欢呼：“敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”会场高悬着的巨幅标语写着：“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    大会在万人齐唱《东方红》的雄壮歌声中开始。革命小将们怀着永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于党、永远忠于人民、永远忠于毛泽东思想的赤诚之心，齐声朗读毛主席语录。
    会上，通过了给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬信。致敬信中说：我们最最敬爱的红司令，请您老人家放心，在您的指引下，我们经受了战斗的洗礼，我们也一定能够接受更大暴风雨的考验。枪林弹雨吓不了我们，糖衣炮弹打不倒我们，阴谋诡计骗不了我们。我们有坚强的信念，我们有无产阶级大无畏的革命气概，我们有无产阶级的革命到底的壮志豪情。我们决不做历史上昙花一现的人物，我们誓做全心全意为工农兵群众服务、为世界革命人民服务的永不生锈的革命螺丝钉。
    大会通过的《首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会宣言》庄严地宣告：
    我们的最高红司令是最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    我们的指导思想是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我们是中国人民解放军的最强大的后备军。
    我们的组织原则是民主集中制。
    接着，大会通过了《首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会告全国中等学校红卫兵书》。
    《首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会告全国中等学校红卫兵书》强调指出：毛主席教导我们：实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导。我们一定要认真地领会并坚决实行毛主席的这一伟大的战略思想，正确地贯彻党的阶级路线，坚决依靠革命的左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，彻底孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    首都中学无产阶级革命派组织代表在大会上作了联合发言。他们怀着无比激动的心情，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！他们热烈欢呼中学红卫兵在毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大。他们指出：中学红代会的召开，只是万里长征的第一步，更艰巨的任务在等待着我们。他们说，不管道路多么曲折，不管前进中还有多少风险，我们都将永远坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。联合发言最后说：敬爱的毛主席啊！是您把中国的前途和世界的前途交给了我们青年一代，我们一定不辜负您老人家的殷切期望，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们一定要让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全球！
    在会上发言的首都中等学校华侨学生代表，是同印度尼西亚反动派进行英勇顽强斗争后回到祖国的四十一名华侨青少年之一。他说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命是一场防止资本主义复辟，铲除修正主义根子，巩固无产阶级专政，保证我国永不变色的伟大革命运动。
    北京市革命职工代表会议、北京市贫下中农代表会议的代表和中国人民解放军北京卫戍区的代表先后在发言中表示，誓做红卫兵小将的坚强后盾，决心和红卫兵小将们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。坚决打退资本主义反革命复辟的逆流，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    中国人民解放军北京卫戍区副司令员李钟奇同志代表全体指战员发言时说：我们深信，经过这次大会，首都中等学校的无产阶级革命派，必将更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，为无产阶级文化大革命作出新的贡献。
