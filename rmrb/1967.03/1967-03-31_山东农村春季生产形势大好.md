Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," the spring production situation in rural Shandong is excellent.

After several months of a vigorous Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are full of vigor; first-line command organizations have been rapidly and universally established at all levels; the People's Liberation Army has gone deep into the countryside to propagate Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions, which have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. This is the PLA's greatest support for spring production.

Our reporter's commentary: Amidst the triumphant songs of the Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," the spring production upsurge in the rural areas of Shandong Province is vigorously advancing.

After several months of the vigorous Cultural Revolution, the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of people and cadres in rural Shandong has undergone tremendous changes. An important sign of this change is that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have never had such a strong sense of responsibility as masters of the house, and their enthusiasm for managing the collective economy has never been so high. They actively participate in the leadership of the first-line production command organizations at all levels and have played a great role in production. When a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, at the critical moment of spring production, threw up their hands and wanted to laugh at the poor and lower-middle peasants, the poor and lower-middle peasants, with the strong support of the local garrison troops, stood up and shouldered the thousand-jin burden of spring plowing. They braved the wind, snow, and cold, and worked through the night, accumulating and making fertilizer, plowing and harrowing the spring fields, building farmland water conservancy projects, strengthening wheat field management, and creating outstanding achievements in production. Another important sign of this change is that a new working style of trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' spirit of initiative has begun to take root among the broad revolutionary cadres. Many cadres, with their backpacks and Chairman Mao's works, went among the masses. They ate, lived, and worked with the masses, serving as both commanders and fighters, and received the enthusiastic praise of the masses. Some cadres who had made mistakes, because they seriously examined themselves, stood up straight, and held their posts, also received the understanding and support of the masses. Now, spring production activities throughout the province have been fully launched. The production army, with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force and the militia as the backbone, is strengthening wheat field management, planting trees, and preparing for spring sowing. The facts have proven that "the Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country."

After the seizure of power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in Shandong Province, under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, with the strong assistance of the PLA units stationed in Shandong and various levels of people's armed forces, the "three-in-one combination" first-line command organizations for grasping the revolution and promoting production have been rapidly established. The characteristics of the establishment of this command organization are: rapid, universal, and strong. Now, from the province, prefecture, and county to the commune and production brigade, such command organizations have been established at all levels. Because this command organization is composed of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives of local garrison troops (or militia representatives), it is the most representative, the most democratic, and the most authoritative. Once these organizations were established, they played a great role in spring production. Such a leadership organization unites the three forces into one, forming a vast production army. People's hearts and efforts are united, and the channels of command are smooth from top to bottom, left to right. Cadres and masses work together in harmony, fighting side by side, making spring production vigorous and solid. After the establishment of such a command organization, it fully utilizes the authority of the proletariat to implement high concentration on the basis of proletarian democracy, concentrating manpower and material resources on the production frontline. According to statistics from the Hui Min, De Zhou, Liao Cheng, He Ze, and Ji Ning regions, more than ten thousand cadres have been sent to the frontline by the production command organizations. At the same time, most counties and communes have held three-level cadre meetings and oath-taking meetings for grasping the revolution and promoting production, further studying Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and implementing production plans and key measures for increased production.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command spring production, is the fundamental reason why the spring production situation in rural Shandong is excellent this year. Various places, with the PLA units stationed in the area as the main force, have formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and propaganda groups, going deep into the communes and brigades to vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and propagate the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Countryside." This is the PLA's greatest support for spring production. Through their extensive propaganda, Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions have deeply penetrated the hearts of everyone. The political enthusiasm of cadres and masses has greatly increased, and spring production actions are swift and effective. Many cadres have expressed that Chairman Mao cares for us, believes in us, and we will not disappoint his expectations. We must work together with the broad revolutionary masses to do a good job in spring production, build new merits, and create new labor in spring production. After mastering Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have become even smarter. Many regions have arranged this year's spring production plan starting from correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual; starting from specific conditions, arranging the layout of various crops, and taking measures to prevent both drought and flooding, making this year's agricultural harvest stand on a solid and reliable foundation. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams that have gone deep into various places have also helped the poor and lower-middle peasants establish the system of studying Chairman Mao's works, using various forms to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. This approach is deeply welcomed by the broad masses.

Industry, commerce, finance, and transportation in various sectors have also, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," taken various measures to timely transport the materials needed for spring plowing to the spring production frontline, supporting spring production.

The spring production situation in Shandong Province is excellent, but there are also some problems and shortcomings: in some places, the new revolutionary order has not yet been established, and the role of the new production leadership team has not been fully played; the production plan needs to be further implemented, and the repair of agricultural machinery and the adjustment of seeds need to be properly solved. These problems have already attracted the attention of relevant departments.

    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大战略方针指引下
    山东农村春季生产形势大好
    经过几个月轰轰烈烈的文化大革命，广大贫下中农和革命干部精神焕发；各级第一线指挥机构迅速普遍建立起来；解放军深入农村大力宣传，毛主席和党中央的指示深入人心，这是解放军对春季生产的最大支援。
    本报讯　本报记者述评：在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大战略方针的指引下，山东省广大农村春季生产高潮正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
    经过几个月来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，山东农村广大群众和干部的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。这个变化的重要标志是：广大贫下中农和革命群众当家做主的责任感从来没有这样强，掌管集体经济的积极性从来没有这样高。他们积极地参与各级生产第一线指挥机构的领导，在生产上发挥了极大的作用。当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在春季生产的关键时刻，撒手不管，妄想看贫下中农笑话的时候，贫下中农在当地驻军的大力支持下，挺身而出，挑起了春耕生产的千斤重担。他们冒着风雪严寒，披星戴月，积肥造肥，耕耙春地，兴修农田水利，加强麦田管理，在生产上创造了优异的成绩。这个变化的另一个重要标志是：相信群众、依靠群众、放手发动群众、尊重群众首创精神的崭新的群众路线的工作作风，在广大革命干部中开始树立起来。许多干部，背起行装，带上毛主席著作，迈开双脚，走到群众中去。他们和群众一起，同吃、同住、同劳动，既是指挥员，又是战斗员，得到了群众的热烈赞扬。一些犯过错误的干部，由于他们认真作了检查，挺起了腰杆，坚守生产岗位，也得到了群众的谅解和支持。现在，全省春季生产活动已经全面展开。以贫下中农为主力军、以民兵为骨干的生产大军，正在加强麦田管理、开展植树造林和进行春播前的一切准备工作。事实已经证明“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力”。
    山东省无产阶级革命派夺权以后，在省革命委员会的领导下，在驻山东地区人民解放军陆海空部队和各级人民武装部门的大力协助下，迅速地建立起“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥机构。这个指挥机构建立的特点是：迅速、普遍、坚强。现在，从省、地、县到公社、大队，层层建立了这种指挥机构。由于这个指挥机构是以革命群众组织的代表、革命领导干部和当地驻军代表（或民兵代表）组成的，因此，它最有代表性，最能发挥民主，最有权威。这些组织机构一经建立，就在春季生产中发挥了巨大的作用。这样的领导机构，把三股力量拧到一起，汇成一支浩浩荡荡的生产大军，人们心往一处想，劲往一处使，上下左右，指挥渠道畅通，干部群众同心协力，共同战斗，使春季生产搞得轰轰烈烈，踏踏实实。这种指挥机构建立后，充分运用无产阶级的权威，在无产阶级大民主的基础上实行高度集中，把人力、物力集中到生产第一线上。据惠民、德州、聊城、菏泽、济宁地区的统计，生产指挥机构派到第一线的干部达一万多人。与此同时，绝大部分县社都召开了三级干部会，抓革命促生产誓师大会，进一步学习了毛主席和党中央“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，落实生产计划和关键性的增产措施。
    用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，用毛泽东思想指挥春季生产，是今年山东农村春季生产形势大好的一个根本原因。各地以人民解放军驻当地部队为主，组成了毛泽东思想宣传队、宣传组，深入社队大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。这是解放军对春季生产的最大支持。通过他们广泛的宣传，毛主席和党中央的指示，深入到了每个人的心里，干部、群众的政治热情大为高涨，春季生产行动快，效果好。许多干部表示，毛主席关怀我们，相信我们，我们决不辜负他老人家的希望，一定要和广大革命群众一起把春季生产搞好，在春季生产中建新功，立新劳。广大革命群众和革命干部，掌握了毛泽东思想和党的方针政策以后，变得更加聪明了。不少地区都从正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系出发，安排今年的春季生产计划；从具体条件出发，安排各种作物的布局，并采取了旱涝并防的措施，使今年的农业丰收建立在坚实可靠的基础上。深入各地的毛泽东思想宣传队，还帮助贫下中农建立学习毛主席著作的制度，采用多种多样的形式，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段。这种做法，深受广大群众的欢迎。
    工业、财贸、交通各行各业，也都以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，采取各种措施，把春耕所需物资，适时运到春耕生产第一线，支援了春耕生产。
    山东省春季生产形势大好，但是也存在着一些问题和缺点：少数地方，新的革命秩序还没有建立起来，新的生产领导班子的作用还没有充分发挥；生产计划还需要进一步落实，农机具的检修，种子的调剂需要妥善解决。这些问题已经引起了有关部门的重视。（附图片）
