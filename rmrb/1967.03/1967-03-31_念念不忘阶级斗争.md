	Never forget class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us to "grasp revolution and promote production," which means to grasp the key of class struggle and promote the development of production struggle and scientific experimentation.

	The report on Fengcheng Tangshan City Brigade is a vivid example.

	The revolutionary masses of this brigade smashed the plot of a handful of bad elements to sabotage spring plowing and production, which was a class struggle in society. The revolutionary masses of this brigade, from not understanding clearly to seeing things clearly, was also a class struggle in the minds of the people.

	To win this struggle, the most powerful weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Listen to what the old poor peasant Gao Yunchen said: "We farmers, working the land for the revolution is our duty. We don't covet those few work points, nor do we covet going to carry sand to make a few stinking dollars. We want to 'grasp revolution and promote production,' we want Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." These words are so well said! It is Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's great call to do a good job in spring plowing that has inspired the poor and lower-middle peasants' proletarian consciousness, making them further brighten their eyes, see the direction clearly, and resolutely resist the class enemy's temptation of "making a fortune," resolutely stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and devote their whole heart and soul to the spring plowing battle.

	We must use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In any situation, we must put revolution in the first place. Use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to direct the spring plowing battle, use grasping revolution to promote spring plowing.

    念念不忘阶级斗争
    毛主席教导我们要“抓革命，促生产”，也就是教导我们要抓住阶级斗争这个纲，促进生产斗争和科学实验的发展。
    凤城汤山城大队这篇通讯是一个活生生的例证。
    这个大队的革命群众粉碎一小撮坏人破坏春耕生产的阴谋，是一场阶级斗争——社会上的阶级斗争。这个大队的革命群众从认识不清到心明眼亮，也是一场阶级斗争——人们头脑里的阶级斗争。
    要胜利地进行这场斗争，最锐利的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。请听听老贫农高云臣说的话吧：“咱庄稼人，为革命种田是咱的本分。咱不希罕那几个工分，更不希罕去运砂子搞几个臭钱，咱要的是‘抓革命，促生产’，要的是毛主席的革命路线。”这话说得多么好哇！正是毛主席和党中央的搞好春耕的伟大号召启发了贫下中农的无产阶级觉悟，使他们进一步擦亮了眼睛，看清了方向，坚决抵制了阶级敌人“一本万利”的引诱，坚决站到毛主席革命路线上来，全心全力地投入了春耕战斗。
    我们一定要用毛泽东思想武装贫下中农的头脑，在任何情况下，都要把革命放在首位。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去指挥春耕战斗，用抓革命去促春耕。
