A reporter from our news agency commented on the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City: Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the heroic proletarian revolutionary faction of Qingdao City, after taking the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fate of the proletarian dictatorship, and the fate of the socialist economy into their own hands, immediately demonstrated boundless wisdom and power. Currently, the revolution in Qingdao is booming, production is thriving, and the city is filled with the triumphant songs of victory in both revolution and production. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City is excellent!

The first important sign of the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City is that the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction, united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are continuing to carry out the struggle to seize power from the bottom up in all units that need to seize power throughout the city. They have seized back all the power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Now, the vast majority of units that need to seize power have achieved victory in the struggle to seize power and are further carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction has become more consolidated and expanded.

Currently, the revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in various systems, departments, and units throughout the city are closely united around the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee, forming a vast, organized, and disciplined cultural revolution army. They have unified thinking and unified steps, and are invincible and unstoppable.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao has made significant contributions to the struggle to seize power in Qingdao City. When a counter-revolutionary anti-seizure tide appeared in Qingdao at the end of January, the soldiers of the PLA stationed in Qingdao, fully armed, held three consecutive days of grand parades and demonstrations, shocking Qingdao, quickly dispersing the dark clouds hanging over Qingdao, and defending the victory of the proletarian revolutionary faction's struggle to seize power. The People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's great call and fought side by side with the broad leftist masses, making the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qingdao City even stronger and more consolidated.

In the triumphant songs of the struggle to seize power, the puppet organizations of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have completely collapsed, and a large number of masses who were previously deceived have quickly awakened. They have risen up to denounce the heinous crimes and deceptive tricks of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, flocking to the revolutionary faction and becoming an important force in the great revolutionary torrent. The proletarian revolutionary faction does not hold past mistakes against those who were deceived and dared to revolt against the capitalist-roaders, but encourages them enthusiastically, helps them patiently, and unites them sincerely, uniting the broadest possible forces.

The second important sign of the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City is that Chairman Mao's cadre policy is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people, and batch after batch of revolutionary leading cadres are stepping forward, bravely standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have been afraid that revolutionary cadres would "emerge" and have done everything in their power to obstruct revolutionary cadres from revolting against them. However, their plots have failed. Under the call of Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the education and help of the proletarian revolutionary faction, the revolutionary cadres of Qingdao City have broken through numerous obstacles and stepped forward in batches. Following the former vice mayor of Qingdao, Wang Xiaoyu, the former secretary of the South District Committee of the Communist Party of Qingdao, Ju Weixin, and the former secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Committee and mayor, Li Yuanrong, more than fifty revolutionary leading cadres at the level of bureau and section chiefs have recently stepped forward. These "emerged" revolutionary cadres have joined the revolutionary ranks and turned against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, making them even more isolated. Many outstanding cadres who have been tested by the revolutionary storms have participated in the "three-in-one" temporary power organs, making it relatively smooth for the temporary power organs to exercise their functions.

The brave emergence of revolutionary leading cadres has set an example for the broad mid-level and grassroots cadres in Qingdao City. Under the impetus of the great Cultural Revolution, with the education and help of the broad proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses, and the leadership of revolutionary cadres, tens of thousands of revolutionary cadres in Qingdao City have risen up to firmly fight against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and to settle accounts with the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have dispelled the concern of "cadres fearing that the masses will not trust them" and discarded the wrong idea of passively waiting to be criticized, beginning to go among the masses and into the struggle. At the critical moment when a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party tried to create difficulties for the revolutionary masses, they took up the heavy responsibility of seizing the revolution and promoting production together with the broad revolutionary masses.

The third important sign of the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City is that after the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, they responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," fiercely seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. The city's industrial production has risen sharply, and the news of victory in both revolution and production has been continuously coming out.

In January of this year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Qingdao City spread the counter-revolutionary wind of economicism, causing some factories to face the threat of shutdown, and production in many mines and enterprises generally declined in the first half of January. However, after the victory of the proletarian revolutionary faction's seizure of power on January 22, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres were spirited and full of fighting spirit, working day and night to seize the revolution and promote production, rapidly developing the city's industrial production. In February of this year, the city's total industrial output value exceeded the plan by more than 10% and increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year. The quality of most products has been stabilized and improved, and the variety has increased.

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party promoted "material incentives" in an attempt to undermine the revolutionary will of the working class and lead the socialist economy down the revisionist path. After the broad proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they insisted on political leadership, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, strengthened political and ideological work, and paid attention to giving full play to people's subjective initiative. They not only quickly smashed the counter-revolutionary economicist counterattack but also continuously achieved victories in both revolution and production.

Over the past month, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qingdao City has overturned the previous layer-upon-layer pyramid-style management structure and replaced it with a management system of proletarian democratic centralism. Many industrial and mining enterprises in Qingdao City have established revolutionary production committees and service teams. The members of the revolutionary production committees and service teams work with the masses to participate in, study, and manage production, effectively promoting the development of production. Many revolutionary cadres and engineering and technical personnel who have been absorbed into the production leadership have, with the help of the proletarian revolutionary faction, also changed their previous detached leadership style, gone deep into the production front line, strengthened front-line command, and focused on key issues, playing an important role in the production struggle.

In the early days of the proletarian revolutionary faction's seizure of power, some capitalist-roaders did not give up and even boasted that they would "wait and see the spectacle of the rebels!" However, over the past month, the proletarian revolutionary faction, with a fearless spirit, seized the revolution and promoted production, giving a resounding slap in the face to a handful of capitalist-roaders.

The fourth important sign of the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City is that the proletarian revolutionary faction, with the main ideological issues that arose after the victory of the seizure of power, has pushed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, timely launched an open rectification movement, eliminated all non-proletarian thoughts, and seized the power of the "self" in their minds.

After the victory of the seizure of power, arrogance, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, and the tendency to stop and not seek progress began to appear within the proletarian revolutionary faction. Some leaders of some revolutionary organizations had varying degrees of small-groupism, sectarianism, factionalism, and localism. These all corroded the fighting spirit of the revolutionary faction, were not conducive to the unity of the leftist forces, and provided an opportunity for the class enemy to attack. In this situation, the proletarian revolutionary faction, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, continued to fight while carrying out open rectification, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and launched a timely "seizure of power" struggle against the "self" in their minds.

During the rectification movement, the proletarian revolutionary faction, with the ideological problems that existed in the previous struggle, studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and other brilliant works, using the methods of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions, fiercely attacked the "self" in their minds. They regarded themselves as both a force for revolution and an object of revolution, transforming both the objective world and the subjective world, daring to carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls.

From the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee to the leaders of many grassroots revolutionary organizations, through the study of Chairman Mao's works, they deeply realized the harm of the "self." They said that if the "self" in the depths of the soul is not dug out in time, even if the power is seized, this power still has the danger of changing color. They took the lead in self-criticism, adhering to the principle of strict self-requirement, consciously cutting off the tail of individualism, and actively digging out the "self" in the depths of the soul.

The ongoing rectification movement has strongly promoted the in-depth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City. During the rectification, some units' proletarian revolutionary factions achieved great unity by department and system. The great unity and solidarity of the proletarian revolutionary faction throughout the city have been further consolidated, and their combat effectiveness has been further enhanced.

The great victory achieved by the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qingdao City in the struggle to seize and hold power once again eloquently proved the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and proved that the proletarian revolutionary faction, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is fully capable of mastering its own destiny. The proletarian revolutionary faction loves Chairman Mao the most and listens to Chairman Mao's words the most. They will definitely continue to advance victoriously along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao!

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The proletarian revolutionary faction in Qingdao City, with their hearts for the motherland and their eyes on the world, are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    青岛无产阶级革命派显示巨大智慧和力量
    全市响彻着革命和生产双胜利的凯歌
    据新华社济南八日电　本社记者评述青岛市当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势说：在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，英雄的青岛市无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把无产阶级专政的命运和社会主义经济的命运掌握到自己手里以后，立即充分显示出无穷的智慧和力量。目前，青岛全市革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾，到处响彻着革命和生产双胜利的凯歌。青岛市无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很！
    青岛市无产阶级文化大革命形势大好的第一个重要标志是，广大无产阶级革命派团结在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，在全市范围内，在一切需要夺权的单位，继续展开了自下而上的夺权斗争，把凡是被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的一切权力都统统夺回来。现在，全市绝大部分需要夺权的单位都已经取得夺权斗争的胜利，正在进一步开展斗、批、改。在激烈的两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路的大搏斗中，无产阶级革命派的大联合更加巩固和扩大了。
    目前，全市各系统、各部门、各单位的革命群众组织和广大革命群众，紧密地团结在青岛市革命委员会的周围，结成了一支浩浩荡荡的有组织有纪律的文化革命大军。他们思想统一，步调统一，所向披靡，势不可挡。
    在青岛市夺权斗争中作出重大贡献的人民解放军驻青岛部队，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边。当一月底青岛市出现一股反革命的反夺权逆流时，驻青岛部队指战员全副武装，连续举行三天声势浩大的游行示威，威震青岛，迅速驱散弥漫在青岛上空的乌云，捍卫了无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利。人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，同左派广大群众并肩战斗，使青岛市无产阶级革命派的大联合更加强大，更加巩固。
    在夺权斗争的凯歌声中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的御用组织全线崩溃，大批过去受蒙蔽的群众迅速觉醒。他们奋起控诉党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行和欺骗群众的阴谋诡计，纷纷向革命派靠拢，成为伟大的革命洪流中的一支重要力量。无产阶级革命派对于大胆起来造走资本主义道路当权派的反的受蒙蔽的群众，不咎既往，热情鼓励，耐心帮助，真诚团结，最广泛地团结了一切可以团结的力量。
    青岛市无产阶级文化大革命形势大好的第二个重要标志是，毛主席的干部政策日益深入人心，一批又一批革命的领导干部挺身而出，勇敢地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    文化大革命开始以来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派唯恐革命的领导干部“杀”出阵来，百般阻挠革命领导干部起来造他们的反。然而，他们的阴谋失败了。青岛市革命领导干部在毛主席干部政策的感召下，在无产阶级革命派的教育和帮助下，冲破重重阻力，一批又一批地站了出来。继前青岛市副市长王效禹，前中共青岛市南区委书记鞠维信和前青岛市委书记处书记、市长李元荣之后，最近又有五十多名局、处长以上的革命领导干部站了出来。这些“杀”出来的革命干部加入革命阵线以后，反戈一击，使得党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派陷入了更加孤立的境地。许多经受了革命风浪考验的优秀干部，参加了“三结合”的临时权力机构，使得临时权力机构能够比较顺利地行使自己的职权。
    革命的领导干部勇敢地站了出来，给青岛市的广大中级干部和基层干部树立了榜样。在伟大的文化大革命洪流的推动下，在广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的教育和帮助下，在革命领导干部的带动下，青岛市成千上万的革命干部，纷纷起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行坚决的斗争，纷纷起来清算资产阶级反动路线的流毒。他们打消了“干部造反怕群众不信任”的顾虑，抛掉了消极等待挨整的错误思想，开始到群众中去，到斗争中去。在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派甩手伸腿，妄图刁难革命群众的关键时刻，他们和广大革命群众一起，勇敢地挑起了抓革命，促生产的重担。
    青岛市无产阶级文化大革命形势大好的第三个重要标志是，无产阶级革命派夺权以后，响应毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全市工业生产直线上升，革命和生产双胜利的喜讯不断传出。
    今年一月，青岛市党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大刮反革命经济主义的阴风，使得有些工厂面临着停产的威胁，一月上中旬不少工矿企业生产普遍下降。但是，一月二十二日全市无产阶级革命派夺权胜利后，广大革命群众和革命干部精神振奋，斗志昂扬，夜以继日地大抓革命，狠促生产，使全市工业生产得到迅速发展。今年二月份，全市工业总产值超额百分之十以上完成了计划，比去年同期增长百分之二十以上。大部分产品质量稳定提高，品种有所增加。
    过去，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大搞“物质刺激”，妄图瓦解工人阶级的革命意志，把社会主义经济引到修正主义的邪路上去。广大无产阶级革命派掌握大权以后，坚持政治挂帅，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，加强政治思想工作，注意发挥人的主观能动性，不仅很快粉碎了反革命经济主义的反扑，而且不断地取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    一个多月来，青岛市无产阶级革命派打翻了过去那种层层叠叠的宝塔式的管理机构，代之以实行无产阶级民主集中制的管理制度。青岛市许多工矿企业都成立了革命生产委员会和服务组。革命生产委员会和服务组成员同群众一起参加生产，研究生产，管理生产，有力地推动了生产的发展。许多被吸收参加生产领导的革命干部和工程技术人员，在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，也改变了过去高高在上的脱离群众的旧领导作风，深入生产第一线，加强火线指挥，狠抓关键，在生产斗争中起了重要作用。
    无产阶级革命派夺权初期，一些走资本主义道路的当权派不服输，有的还扬言要“等着看造反派的热闹！”可是，一个多月来，无产阶级革命派以大无畏的精神，抓了革命，促了生产，给了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一记响亮的耳光。
    青岛市无产阶级文化大革命形势大好的第四个重要标志是，无产阶级革命派带着夺权胜利后出现的主要思想问题，把活学活用毛主席著作推向新的阶段，及时开展开门整风运动，清除一切非无产阶级思想，破私立公，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。
    夺权胜利以后，无产阶级革命派内部的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，开始露头。有些革命组织的一些负责人，存在着程度不等的小团体主义、宗派主义、山头主义、本位主义等错误思想。这些都腐蚀着革命派的斗志，不利于左派队伍的团结，并且给阶级敌人提供了进攻的缺口。在这种情况下，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，一边继续战斗，一边开门整风，活学活用毛主席著作，及时地发动了向自己头脑里“私”字开战的“夺权斗争”。　
    在整风运动中，无产阶级革命派带着前段斗争中思想上存在的问题，刻苦地学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，用大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方法，猛烈地向自己头脑里的“私”字开炮，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又把自己当作革命的对象，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，勇于在灵魂深处闹革命。
    从青岛市革命委员会到许多基层单位革命组织的负责人，通过学习毛主席著作，深刻认识到“私”字的危害性。他们说，如果不及早挖掉灵魂深处“私”字的根，尽管夺了大权，这个政权仍有改变颜色的危险。他们带头引火烧身，本着从严要求自己的原则，自觉割个人主义的尾巴，主动挖灵魂深处的“私”字。
    正在深入开展的整风运动，有力地推动了青岛市无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展。在整风中，有些单位的无产阶级革命派实现了按部门、按系统的大联合。全市无产阶级革命派的大联合、大团结更加巩固了，战斗力更加增强了。
    青岛市无产阶级革命派在夺权和掌权斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，再一次雄辩地证明了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无穷威力，证明了在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的无产阶级革命派，完全有力量主宰自己的命运。无产阶级革命派最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，他们一定能够沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道继续胜利前进！
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”青岛市无产阶级革命派胸怀祖国，放眼世界，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
