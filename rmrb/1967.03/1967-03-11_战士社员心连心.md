Soldiers and commune members sing revolutionary songs as they march out of camp, a vast army rushing to the countryside. Soldiers heed the Party's call, providing strong support for the spring plowing. Spring plowing is like going to battle, people and horses rejoice as the earth is turned. Sweating, we till the soil like spring rain, we are the people Chairman Mao has sent.

Spring plowing and sowing are urgent tasks, we must not delay and must work hard. Horses kick up dust as they race to sow the seeds, competing for every second to take the lead. First, we sow the seeds of revolution, uprooting the "self" weed. We grasp revolution to promote production, we are the people Chairman Mao has sent.

Soldiers and commune members are united in spirit, fighting side by side during spring plowing. With red hearts following Chairman Mao, silver hoes sketch a new scene. Red flags flutter as songs of victory ring out; wherever there is hardship, we go. We are the people Chairman Mao has sent.

    战士社员心连心
    上海警备区　孙一广　王泉轩高唱战歌出营门，千军万马奔农村；战士最听党的话，大力支援闹春耕。春耕好比上战场，人欢马跃地翻腾；挥汗入土当春雨，我们是毛主席派来的人。春耕春播当务紧，不误农时忙耕耘；战马扬尘抢播种，争分夺秒打头阵。播种先播革命种，斩草猛除“私”字根；大抓革命促生产，我们是毛主席派来的人。战士社员心连心，并肩战斗闹春耕；红心紧跟毛主席，银锄描绘新图景。红旗招展迎歌声，胜利一定属我们；那里有困难到那里去，我们是毛主席派来的人。
