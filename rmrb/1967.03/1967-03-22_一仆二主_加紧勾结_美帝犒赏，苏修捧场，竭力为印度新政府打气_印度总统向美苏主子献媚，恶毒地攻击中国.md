The U.S. imperialists reward, the Soviet revisionists cheer, and they are vigorously boosting the new Indian government.

The Indian president fawns over his U.S. and Soviet masters, viciously attacking China.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th: New Delhi news: On the 18th, Indian President Radhakrishnan delivered an opening speech at the parliamentary session after the election, spreading vicious attacks on China on one hand, and fabricating lies to deceive the Indian people on the other. This shows the reactionary and weak nature of the new Indian government that has taken power.

Radhakrishnan, when talking about foreign policy, fawned over the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in a disgusting manner, extolling the "most friendly relations" between the Indian reactionaries and them. He then launched a tirade against China, claiming that China's "aggressive behavior and posture" are the "main obstacles" to improving Sino-Indian relations, and so on. Now, the Indian reactionary government, with the support of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, is receiving various weapons and waiting for an opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion of China. However, the Indian president shamelessly talked about the Indian government's so-called desire for "peaceful coexistence" with China in his speech.

The Indian reactionary government, with the support of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, launched an unbridled military invasion of Pakistan. Now, Radhakrishnan, when talking about Indo-Pakistani relations, hypocritically says that "what troubles us the most are the hatred and conflicts that sometimes separate our two countries."

The Indian government's policy of "striking and then pulling back" towards Pakistan is obviously a scheme devised by its backers, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: New Delhi news: The new Indian government led by Indira Gandhi and Desai, after taking power, has repeatedly received money and grain from U.S. imperialism, and Soviet revisionism has been vigorously promoting and praising it. The two backers are vigorously boosting this pro-U.S., pro-Soviet, anti-China, anti-people government.

On the day the new Indian government took power, the 14th, U.S. imperialism awarded it a large sum of loans. According to Agence France-Presse, the loan amount is 40 million U.S. dollars, from the income of the Indian government selling American wheat. According to United Press International, the loan amount is 375 million U.S. dollars, from the income of the Indian government selling various American agricultural products. In addition, the U.S. Senate agreed on the 16th to provide the Indian government with 300 million tons of grain and 25 million U.S. dollars in "emergency food aid."

The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist leadership, *Pravda*, TASS, and Moscow Radio have been vigorously promoting the new Indian government and praising Indira Gandhi. The semi-official Indian news agency Indian Press Trust on the 17th specially detailed the Moscow Radio's praise of the new Indian government. This commentary, which reverses black and white, says that the Indian election this time shows that "the Indian people support Nehru's policy." The commentary also praises the efforts of Indira Gandhi's government in colluding with the Soviet revisionists in the past and hopes that it will continue to strive to strengthen bilateral relations.

    一仆二主  加紧勾结
    美帝犒赏，苏修捧场，竭力为印度新政府打气
    印度总统向美苏主子献媚，恶毒地攻击中国
    据新华社十九日讯　新德里消息：印度总统拉达克里希南十八日在大选后的议会会议上致开幕词，一面散布恶毒地攻击中国的言论；一面又编造谎言欺骗印度人民。这表明了新上台的印度政府的反动性和虚弱性。
    拉达克里希南在谈到外交政策时，肉麻地向美帝和苏修献媚，大肆宣扬印度反动派同它们之间的“最友好的关系”。接着他就破口大骂中国，说什么中国的“侵略行为和姿态”是改善中印关系的“主要障碍”等等。现在，印度反动政府正在从美帝和苏修那里领取各种武器，伺机再来大规模侵犯中国。印度总统却在致词中厚颜无耻地谈论所谓印度政府同中国“和平相处”的愿望。
    印度反动政府曾经在美帝苏修支持下，向巴基斯坦发动了肆无忌惮的军事侵略。现在拉达克里希南在谈到印巴关系时，却假仁假义地说什么“最使我们苦恼的是那些有时使我们两国分离的怨恨情绪和冲突”。
    印度政府对巴基斯坦采取这种“打了又拉”的政策，显然是它的后台老板美帝苏修出的主意。
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：以英迪拉·甘地和德赛为首的印度新政府上台后，美帝国主义一再给钱、给粮，苏联修正主义对它大肆宣扬和吹捧。两个后台老板正在竭力替这个亲美、联苏、反华、反人民的政府打气。
    在印度新政府上台的当天，十四日，美帝国主义就赏给它大笔的贷款。据法新社报道，贷款数字是四千万美元，来自印度政府出售美国小麦的收入。据合众国际社报道，贷款数字是三亿七千五百万美元，来自印度政府出售美国各种农产品的收入。此外，美国参议院在十六日同意给印度政府三百万吨粮食和两千五百万美元的“粮食紧急救济款”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团的喉舌《真理报》、塔斯社和莫斯科电台，连日大肆宣扬印度新政府，吹捧英迪拉·甘地。印度半官方通讯社印度报业托辣斯十七日特意详细地转发了莫斯科电台赞许印度新政府的一篇评论。这篇评论颠倒黑白，说什么印度这次大选表明“印度人民支持尼赫鲁的政策”。评论还赞扬英迪拉·甘地的政府过去在同苏修勾结方面所作的努力，并且希望它继续竭力加强双方的关系。
