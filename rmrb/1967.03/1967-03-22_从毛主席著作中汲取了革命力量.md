When I first came to China to visit and tour, in my interactions with the Chinese people, they always mentioned Chairman Mao's teachings. All of this prompted me to decide to study Chairman Mao's works.

After obtaining a copy of Chairman Mao's works in Indonesian, I began reading and studying them for the first time in China—the birthplace of Chairman Mao's works.

At that time, the situation in my homeland made me restless. The fascist reactionaries Suharto and Nasution were ruthlessly pursuing and slaughtering communists, democrats, and revolutionaries. At that time, my heart was filled with a tumult of sorrow and confusion. It was then that I began to read Chairman Mao's works.

When I read Chairman Mao's "The Spark Will Become a Flame" and in "Talks with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong" read, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people," it was as if I saw a brilliant and dazzling light shining from a golden lamp.

From that time on, I found strength, and my confidence in the victory of the Indonesian revolution deepened. I saw clearly that the Indonesian people would definitely be liberated, and this further inspired my resolve for thorough revolution.

The more I studied the experiences of the Chinese revolution and the more I read Chairman Mao's works, the more I saw the truth in them. Each time I read Chairman Mao's works, I gained new insights and strength. I eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works. I felt that one could eat less food and drink less water, but one could not study Chairman Mao's works less. I believe that Mao Zedong Thought is not only a weapon for revolutionary struggle but also a weapon for life. Because studying Mao Zedong Thought, people will know how to live and which path to take. I believe that the Indonesian people should not only follow Mao Zedong's path in revolution but also in life.

Currently, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, Mao Zedong Thought has once again shown its immense power, making imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries tremble with fear.

How wonderful! How wonderful! Because the more Mao Zedong Thought is spread, the faster the oppressed and exploited peoples grasp Mao Zedong Thought, the sooner the day will come to bury imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries in the world.

I deeply feel that spreading Mao Zedong Thought is not only the task of the Chinese people but also the task of every revolutionary in the world. Because Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to all the laboring people and revolutionaries in the world; China also belongs to all the laboring people and revolutionaries in the world. Spreading Mao Zedong Thought is a great contribution to the world revolution. From the bottom of my heart, I vow: I will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought well. Once I return to the embrace of my homeland, I will spread Mao Zedong Thought, so that every Indonesian revolutionary can grasp Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, the Indonesian revolution will advance from victory to victory.

    从毛主席著作中汲取了革命力量
    印尼　拉希德
    当我初次来到中国参观访问时，在同中国人民接触中，他们总是提到毛主席的教导。这一切促使我下定决心去学习毛主席的著作。
    我得到一部印尼文版的毛主席著作后，就在中国——毛主席著作诞生的地方，第一次开始阅读和学习毛主席著作。
    当时祖国的形势使我坐卧不安。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯反动派，对共产党人、民主人士和革命者大肆追捕和屠杀。当时我心里激烈地交织着悲伤和紊乱。在那个时候，我开始阅读毛主席著作。
    当我读到毛主席的《星星之火，可以燎原》，以及在《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》这篇文章里读到“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民”时，我好象看到从金灯里发出来的辉煌灿烂的光芒。
    从那时候起，我得到了力量，对印尼革命的胜利加深了信心。我看清了方向，印尼人民一定会得到解放，因而更鼓舞了我彻底革命的意志。
    学习中国革命的经验越多，读毛主席的著作越多，就越使我看到其中的真理。每次阅读毛主席著作，我都增加了新的认识和力量。我如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。我觉得，饭可以少吃，水可以少喝，但毛主席著作不能少学。我认为，毛泽东思想不但是革命斗争的武器，也是生活的武器。因为学习了毛泽东思想，人们会知道应该怎样生活和应该走什么样的道路。我认为，印尼人民不仅在革命方面要走毛泽东的道路，在生活方面也要走毛泽东的道路。
    目前，在中国无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想又一次显示出无比强大的威力，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派怕得要死，胆颤心惊。
    真是好得很！好得很！因为毛泽东思想传播得越广，被压迫、被剥削人民掌握毛泽东思想越快，埋葬帝国主义、现代修正主义和世界上的所有反动派的日子就会越快到来。
    我深深感到，传播毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的任务，也是世界上每个革命者的任务。因为毛泽东思想不但是属于中国人民的，也是属于全世界所有劳动人民和革命者的；中国也是属于全世界劳动人民和革命者的。传播毛泽东思想也就是对世界革命的重大贡献。我从心底里立下誓言：一定要好好学习毛泽东思想。一旦回到祖国的怀抱，我就要传播毛泽东思想，使每个印尼革命者掌握毛泽东思想。这样，印尼革命就会从胜利走向胜利。（附图片）
