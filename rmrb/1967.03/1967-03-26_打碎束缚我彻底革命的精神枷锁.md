How did I go from executing the bourgeois reactionary line to thoroughly breaking with it and gaining the trust of the masses? The story begins in early November of last year. I once went to a brigade to hold a discussion with the workers. During the discussion, I was surprised to hear them expose the brigade leadership's suppression of the masses and labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." The problems in the brigade were so similar to those in the entire city of Guiyang. Why were so many ordinary people labeled as "counter-revolutionaries"?

With this question in mind, I carefully read the editorial in the 14th issue of *Red Flag* again. As I read, I gradually understood. Many of the points in the editorial that struck at the heart of the bourgeois reactionary line seemed to be directed at the brigade, our Geological Bureau, and the entire city of Guiyang. Thinking about the workers', ordinary cadres', and technicians' complaints and exposure letters from the brigade, and reflecting on my own actions in the bureau, as well as the actions of the former provincial and municipal committees, I realized that the brigade leadership, the bureau leadership, and I myself had all made fundamental mistakes. I declared at a meeting that the brigade leadership, the bureau leadership, and I had all made fundamental mistakes and encouraged the worker comrades to expose and criticize.

In mid-November, I stood on the stage for the first time to accept criticism from the revolutionary masses in the bureau. The facts exposed by the masses and their repeated accusations made me deeply realize that I had committed crimes against the Party and the people.

After the meeting, five responsible comrades from the revolutionary organization had a small discussion with me. Although I was not yet bold, decisive, and swift in my actions to support the revolutionary masses, in my thoughts and feelings, I had begun to sympathize with and support them. Therefore, the discussion was quite harmonious, and some of our views were quite consistent. At that time, my position had not yet completely shifted, and my thoughts were still entangled with the bourgeois reactionary line. So, in some places, I was still vague and hesitant. When the meeting ended, a worker comrade affectionately said, "Comrade Wu, as long as you stand up for the revolution and thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line, we workers welcome you to join us." Another worker comrade also enthusiastically said, "Comrade Wu, I hope you go home and study page 230, paragraph 2 of *Quotations from Chairman Mao* carefully." Their words were deeply moving, and I was stirred and my blood boiled.

Back home, I eagerly flipped to page 230 of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*. Chairman Mao said, "Any political party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable. We demand fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we demand correction, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." I read it over and over again. Chairman Mao's warm instructions and the workers' sincere expectations made me suddenly enlightened, and everything in front of me became clear.

A person's change in stance is often a winding and tortuous process. When I was about to thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line, I hesitated again. To completely stand on the side of the revolutionary masses, I had to examine myself and expose the problems of the entire Party committee. Examining myself was not a problem, but exposing the problems of the Party committee made me hesitant. I still thought that the bureau Party committee had to agree to my exposure, otherwise, it would violate the principle of "collective leadership" of the Party.

The revolutionary masses saw that I was deeply poisoned by the principles of the revisionist organization, and eliminating this poison would take a process. Therefore, they adopted a method of gradually deepening their help. Once, they held a small meeting with about ten people and called me to expose. At that time, although I still had a "fear" in my mind, the meeting had already been convened, and the attendees also agreed to "keep it secret," so I reluctantly exposed.

After returning home, I felt anxious and uneasy, wondering if exposing the problems of the bureau Party committee would violate the Party's principle of "collective leadership"? Would it affect the "unity" among the leading cadres? Would I thereby walk the path of self-exclusion from the Party? Just at this time of great contradiction and distress, I opened the red book again. Chairman Mao said, "Communist Party members should ask why about everything, and should think it over carefully in their minds, see if it conforms to reality and if it is reasonable. They should never be blind followers and should never advocate slavishness."

The great leader's teachings are worth ten thousand words, dispelling all my troubles and doubts.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought shattered the spiritual shackles that restrained my thorough revolution. Thus, I made up my mind to thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line. In this way, I went from being unaware to being aware, from small meetings to large meetings, from verbal to big-character posters, conducting a serious self-examination and thoroughly exposing the bourgeois reactionary line executed by the bureau Party committee. I gained the understanding of the masses, was elected to the core leadership of the revolutionary committee, and participated in the joint seizure of power struggle.

In the future, I will strive to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, stay closely with the revolutionary masses, and in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly remold myself, and strive to establish new merits for the Party and the people!

    打碎束缚我彻底革命的精神枷锁
    原贵州省地质局政治部副主任　武宝儒
    我是怎样从执行资产阶级反动路线，到与资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，得到群众信任的呢？
    事情还得从去年十一月初说起。有一次，我到分队和工人开座谈会。在座谈会上，想不到他们揭发出来的队领导压制群众、把革命群众打成“反革命”的种种事实和局里发生的问题，同整个贵阳市发生的问题竟如此相似。为什么会有这么多普普通通的群众成为“反革命”呢？
    带着这个问题，我再一次仔细地读了《红旗》第十四期社论。读着读着，我心里逐渐明白了。社论中很多击中资产阶级反动路线要害的话就象是对着那个队，对着我们地质局，对着贵阳全市说的。再想想那个队的工人、一般干部、技术员的控诉和揭发信，想到自己在局里所作所为，以及原省、市委的所作所为，跟那个队的领导相比，有过之而无不及的种种事实，我醒悟了，我肯定了省委、市委、局的领导和那个队的领导一样都执行的是资产阶级反动路线。于是我就在一次会上表示：队领导、局领导以及我自己都犯了方向性错误，并鼓励工人同志们揭发批判。
    十一月中旬，我第一次站在台上接受局里革命群众的批判。群众揭露的一件件的事实，一次次的控诉，使我更深刻地认识到我对党对人民犯下了罪。
    会后，革命组织的五个负责同志专门找我开了一个小型的座谈会。虽然我当时在行动上支持革命群众还不勇敢，不坚决，不迅速，但在思想感情上，是开始同情和支持革命群众了。所以，谈得比较融洽，有些观点也比较一致。当时由于自己的立场还没有完全站过来，思想上还跟资产阶级反动路线有着千丝万缕的联系，所以有些地方还是含含糊糊，吞吞吐吐。会议结束时，一位工人同志亲切地说：“老武啊！只要你站起来革命，和资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，我们工人是欢迎你站过来的。”另一位工人同志也热情地对我说：“老武啊，希望你回去好好学习学习《毛主席语录》二三○页第二段。”真是语重心长，我听了感动得心潮起伏，热血沸腾。
    回到家里，我迫不及待地翻开《毛主席语录》二三○页，毛主席说：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我一遍又一遍地读着，毛主席亲切的教导，工人同志殷切的期望，使我豁然开朗，眼前顿觉明亮。
    一个人立场的转变，往往是迂回曲折的。当我要同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂的时候，我又犹豫了。我要完全站在革命群众一边，就既要检查自己，又要揭发整个党委的问题。检查自己是没有问题的，可是揭发党委会的问题我又有顾虑。我还认为局党委同意我揭发我才能揭发，这样才不会破坏党的“集体领导”的原则。
    革命群众看出了我中修正主义组织原则的毒很深，清除这种遗毒必须有一个过程。因而，他们采取了逐渐深入的帮助方法。一次，他们十几个人开了一个小会，把我叫去了，让我揭发，当时自己思想上虽然还有一个“怕”字，但会议已召集起来了，而且到会者也答应要“保守秘密”，于是也就勉强地揭发了。
    回来以后，心里惶恐不安，思忖着，我这样揭发局党委的问题，是不是破坏了党的
  “集体领导”？是不是影响了领导干部之间的“团结”？是不是因此会使自己走上自绝于党的道路？就在这个非常矛盾苦恼的时候，我再一次打开了红彤彤的宝书。毛主席说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”
    伟大领袖的教导，真是一句顶一万句，使我烦恼全消，疑团尽释。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想打碎了束缚影响我彻底革命的精神枷锁。于是我下定决心，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。就是这样，我由不觉悟到觉悟，由小会到大会，由口头到大字报，对自己进行了认真的检查，对局党委执行的资产阶级反动路线做了彻底的揭发。我得到了群众的谅解，被选入革命委员会的领导核心，参加了联合夺权斗争。
    今后我决心更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作，紧紧地和革命群众在一起，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，彻底改造自己，争取为党为人民建立新的功劳！
