In the spring of 1967, the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, known as the Dongfanghong Commune, is actively engaging in the spring plowing campaign. The entire commune, from the leadership to the masses, is united in their efforts to achieve a bumper harvest.

The commune has organized a series of activities to mobilize the masses. Through big-character posters, wall newspapers, and mass meetings, the commune has called on everyone to contribute their strength to the spring plowing. The masses have responded enthusiastically, with many volunteers signing up to participate in the campaign.

The commune has also set up a spring plowing command center to coordinate the work. The center is responsible for organizing the plowing, distributing seeds, and ensuring that the work is carried out smoothly. The center has also established a system of rewards and punishments to encourage the masses to work hard.

The commune has made great progress in the spring plowing campaign. The fields have been plowed, and the seeds have been sown. The masses are working hard to ensure that the crops grow well. The commune is confident that it will achieve a bumper harvest this year.

The Dongfanghong Commune is a model for other communes to follow. Its success in the spring plowing campaign is a result of the united efforts of the masses. The commune's experience shows that as long as the masses are united and work hard, they can overcome any difficulty and achieve any goal.
