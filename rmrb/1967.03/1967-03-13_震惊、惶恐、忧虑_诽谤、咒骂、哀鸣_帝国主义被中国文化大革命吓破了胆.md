Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has shaken the old world with its thunderous force. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, hundreds of millions of Chinese people, in this great revolution, have displayed great revolutionary spirit, sweeping away all the remaining filth of the exploiting classes from the land of China, and sweeping away all the monsters and demons. The great victories achieved in this revolution have greatly inspired the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, fiercely striking at the crumbling rule of the reactionary forces headed by U.S. imperialism, and sounding the death knell for them even more loudly. As the people of the whole of China and the revolutionary people of the whole world cheer together for this great historical feat of mankind, imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are in a state of extreme panic, sensing that their doom is approaching faster.

Malicious Slander Cannot Conceal Inner Terror

Imperialists, first and foremost American imperialists, have been terrified by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Since the beginning of this revolution, they have mobilized all their propaganda machines to slander and defame the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, spreading rumors and slanders, and stirring up anti-China hysteria. They have also mobilized a large number of manpower and resources, paying close attention and closely following the developments of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and its "impact on the outside world" and its "relationship with American national interests." They "feel confused and shocked, and at the same time, they are worried." They are very afraid that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will make socialist China an unshakable iron fortress, completely shattering the imperialist dream of "peaceful evolution" in China. They are even more worried that the sparks of this revolution will spread to various parts of the world, promoting the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, and thus accelerating their own doom.

The imperialists' vicious slanders and malicious attacks on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, no matter how ferocious they may be, cannot conceal their cowardly and terrified appearance. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially since the Red Guards of China have marched onto the streets with great enthusiasm, sweeping away the "four olds" of the exploiting classes and establishing the "four news" of the proletariat, the imperialists have been completely thrown into disarray and have become even more restless. On the one hand, they pretend to be calm and try every means to belittle the great significance and far-reaching influence of this cultural revolution, acting as if the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is just a "trifling matter." However, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk in a meeting of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee had to say worriedly: "Important things are happening in China." Many U.S. officials and bourgeois newspapers also have to admit that the Cultural Revolution in China is "the most important thing in the world today," and it has "far-reaching significance" for the next decade and for the whole world.

Colluding with Soviet Revisionism to Oppose China is Futile

As the Cultural Revolution in our country continues to develop victoriously, the imperialist leaders like Johnson and Rusk have become even more furious. They have intensified their collusion with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, using every opportunity to engage in anti-China crimes. U.S. newspapers have reprinted a large number of anti-China statements and articles from the Soviet revisionists, openly advocating for closer U.S.-Soviet collusion to jointly oppose China. These anti-China "heroes" have all directed their attacks at the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and our great leader Chairman Mao, further exposing their reactionary faces of hostility towards the Chinese people and the cause of human progress.

It is not surprising that the imperialists are frantically attacking the Cultural Revolution in China and stirring up anti-China hysteria. Many Western bourgeois newspapers have revealed their true intentions in opposing the Cultural Revolution in China. The U.S. *Washington Star* said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is "more harmful than beneficial" to Western countries. The British *Sunday Telegraph* exclaimed that the Cultural Revolution in China is "a declaration of war on the entire Western world." Some bourgeois newspapers also admitted that the purpose of the Cultural Revolution in China is to "attempt to eliminate feudal, bourgeois, and Soviet revisionist influences" (U.S. *Washington Post*), the Chinese people are determined to "prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism" (British "Reuters"), "to do what the Soviet Union has not been able to do, to prevent the revisionist disease in advance" (Japanese *Mainichi Shimbun*), and to build China into a revolutionary model that stands in opposition to the Soviet Union, which has restored capitalism (*Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*).

The Dream of "Peaceful Evolution" is Completely Shattered

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great power of Mao Zedong Thought has been demonstrated, and the fact that the broad masses of revolutionary youth, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, are striving to temper themselves into staunch successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the storm of class struggle, has made the imperialists tremble with fear. While they are maliciously slandering our people's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and cursing the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, they have to admit that this Cultural Revolution in China will "produce a new type of person with Mao Zedong Thought" and make the Chinese people "able to withstand various capitalist tricks and schemes in the coming years." They even lament that through this Cultural Revolution, "Chinese youth can be immune" in avoiding bourgeois influences, and Chinese youth will take over the "torch of the Chinese revolution."

The imperialists and reactionaries of various countries are very annoyed by the powerful promotion of socialist construction by the Cultural Revolution in our country. They realize that the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in China will make China even more solid and powerful, and thus more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Therefore, they maliciously distort right and wrong, and erase the great promoting role of this Cultural Revolution in our country for production and construction. In fact, the imperialists' nonsense is not worth refuting. The whole world can see that this magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is powerfully promoting the victorious advance of our country's socialist construction. In the past year, our country's industrial and agricultural production fronts have been reporting victories, presenting a prosperous and thriving scene. Especially, our country successfully conducted three nuclear weapon tests last year, marking that our country's scientific and national defense forces are developing at an even faster pace, powerfully refuting the imperialists' slanders against our country. The U.S. *Christian Science Monitor* reluctantly admitted, "Now it seems that China is moving towards a new upheaval on the economic front." The Japanese *Economist* believes that in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution in China, "there will be a new leap in production and construction."

Since this year, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has entered a broader and deeper stage, and has entered the crucial moment of the struggle for power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the imperialist masters have become even more anxious and restless. They have to admit that this struggle will uproot the roots of revisionism and shatter the illusions of the U.S. imperialists' "peaceful evolution" plot in China. Rusk said in early February with great distress, "The situation in China is of extremely great significance," and "we do not fully understand its significance." However, the U.S. imperialist elements like Rusk are still not giving up, and they blatantly shout to give "gentle and obvious encouragement" to a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in China, saying that "the interests of the United States lie in the emergence of another kind of China." These words fully expose the wolfish ambitions of U.S. imperialism to oppose the Chinese people. The delusions and illusions of U.S. imperialism will be shattered before the relentless march of history.

Unable to Stop the Great Influence of the Cultural Revolution

What the imperialists fear the most is that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will have a great impact on the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, especially that it will promote the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people in their own countries to rise up against them and overthrow them. Some bourgeois newspaper commentaries clearly reflect the fear and anxiety of Johnson and his ilk. Some commentaries say that China, through this Cultural Revolution, "will become a model of a new society that attracts people from all over the world." Some believe that the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will "persist in revolutionary policies" and "uncompromisingly" oppose the struggle against imperialism, and exclaim that this will "have a great impact on the world situation." Some say that in this Cultural Revolution, "China is mobilizing the people to prepare to resist U.S. aggression." Some anxiously say, "China is burning the fire of revolution," and "the thunder in the sky over Asia is getting louder."

Chairman Mao teaches us that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. Chairman Mao said: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us as utterly worthless, then it is even better, then it proves that we not only have drawn a clear line with the enemy, but also proves that our work has been very successful."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is being fiercely attacked by imperialism and reactionaries, which is indeed a great thing. Currently, the unprecedented torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward, breaking through all obstacles. In the face of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, let the reactionary forces of the world led by U.S. imperialism tremble!

    震惊、惶恐、忧虑　诽谤、咒骂、哀鸣
    帝国主义被中国文化大革命吓破了胆
    新华社十二日讯　本社记者报道：我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，以其雷霆万钧之力震撼着整个旧世界。用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万中国人民，在这场大革命中，以大无畏的革命精神，荡涤着中国大地上一切残存的剥削阶级的污泥浊水，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。这场大革命取得的一个又一个的伟大胜利，极大地鼓舞着世界人民的革命斗争，猛烈地冲击着以美帝国主义为首的世界反动势力的摇摇欲坠的统治，更加响亮地敲起了它们的丧钟。当全中国人民和全世界革命人民同声欢呼人类这一伟大的历史创举时，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派却恐慌万状，预感到它们的末日加速来临。
    恶毒诽谤掩盖不住内心惊恐
    帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义者，被中国的无产阶级文化大革命吓破了胆。这场大革命开始以来，他们开动了所有能动用的宣传机器，对中国无产阶级文化大革命竭力进行诽谤和诋毁，大肆造谣诬蔑，掀起反华歇斯底里。他们还动员了大批人力、物力，天天注意，密切跟踪，忙得不可开交，研究中国文化大革命形势的发展及其“对外界的影响”和“同美国国家利益的关系”。他们“感到困惑和震惊，同时产生了忧虑”。他们十分害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命将使社会主义的中国成为永不变色的铁打江山，使帝国主义在中国搞“和平演变”的幻想彻底破灭。他们更担心这场革命的火种传播到世界各地，推动各国人民的革命斗争，从而加速他们的灭亡。
    帝国主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命的切齿咒骂和恶毒攻击，不管来得多么猖狂，都掩盖不了它们色厉内荏、失魂掉魄的狼狈相。在中国共产党八届十一中全会公报发表以后，特别是自从中国红卫兵意气风发地走上街头，横扫剥削阶级“四旧”，大立无产阶级“四新”以来，帝国主义者完全慌了手脚，更加沉不住气了。他们一方面故作镇静，千方百计地贬低这场文化大革命的伟大意义和深远影响，装腔作势地说什么中国的无产阶级文化大革命只不过是“区区小事”。然而，美国国务卿腊斯克在美国参议院战备小组委员会的一次会议上却又不得不忧心忡忡地说：“中国正在发生一些非常重要的事情。”不少美国官员和资产阶级报刊也不得不承认，中国的文化大革命是“今天世界上唯一最重要的事情”，对下一个十年，对全世界都具有“深远的意义”。
    勾结苏修联合反华也是枉然
    随着我国文化大革命的胜利发展，约翰逊、腊斯克之流的帝国主义头目们，更加暴跳如雷。他们加紧同苏联修正主义统治集团勾结，利用一切机会，进行反华的罪恶勾当。美国报刊大量转载苏修反华的声明和文章，公开鼓吹美苏加紧勾结，联合反华。这些反华的“英雄”们一齐把攻击的矛头直接指向中国人民、中国共产党，指向我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，进一步暴露了他们敌视中国人民和人类进步事业的反动面目。
    帝国主义者拚命地攻击中国文化大革命，掀起反华歇斯底里，这是毫不足奇的。许多西方资产阶级报刊透露了他们反对中国文化大革命的底细。美国《华盛顿明星晚报》说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，对西方国家来说是“凶多吉少”。英国《星期日电讯报》惊呼，中国文化大革命“是向整个西方世界的一次宣战”。一些资产阶级报刊还承认，中国文化大革命的目的在于“力图根除封建的、资产阶级的和苏联修正主义的影响”（美国《华盛顿邮报》），中国人民决心“防止修正主义的出现和资本主义的复辟”（英国“路透社”），“要做到苏联没有能够做到的事情，防修正主义之患于未然”（日本《每日新闻》），使中国建设成为一个同资本主义复辟的苏联“相对立的革命的榜样”（西德《法兰克福汇报》）。
    “和平演变”的幻想彻底破灭
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的毛泽东思想所显示出的巨大威力，以及广大的革命青少年按照毛主席的教导，努力在阶级斗争的暴风雨中把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人的事实，使帝国主义者害怕得要死。他们在恶毒地诬蔑我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动和咒骂红卫兵的革命行动的同时，不得不承认，中国这场文化大革命将要用毛泽东思想“造就新型的人”，使中国人民“在今后的年代里能顶住资本主义的种种阴谋诡计”。他们甚至哀叹，通过这场文化大革命，在如何避免资产阶级影响方面“中国青年是可以免疫的”，中国青少年将接过“中国的革命火炬”。
    帝国主义和各国反动派，对于我国文化大革命有力地推动着社会主义建设事业的发展大为恼火。他们意识到，中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，将使中国变得更加巩固和强大，从而更有力地支援世界人民的革命斗争。因此，他们别有用心地颠倒是非，抹煞我国这场文化大革命对于生产建设的巨大推动作用。其实，帝国主义者们的胡言乱语是不值一驳的。全世界都看到，这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，正在有力地推动着我国社会主义建设事业的胜利前进。一年来，我国工农业生产战线上捷报频传，呈现着一片繁荣兴旺的景象。特别是我国在去年一年内连续三次进行核武器试验成功，标志着我国科学事业和国防力量正以更大的速度向前发展，有力地回击了帝国主义对我国的诬蔑。美国《基督教科学箴言报》无可奈何地承认，“现在看来，中国正在朝着一次经济战线上的新的激变前进”。日本《经济学人》认为，在中国文化大革命的高潮中，“将会出现新的生产和建设的大跃进”。
    今年以来，在中国无产阶级文化大革命进入一个更广阔、更深入的阶段，进入了无产阶级革命派对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行夺权斗争的关键时刻，帝国主义老爷们的惶惑不安，表现得更加突出了。他们不得不承认，这场斗争将挖掉修正主义的根子，粉碎美帝国主义在中国推行“和平演变”阴谋的迷梦。腊斯克在二月初十分苦恼地说，在中国发生的情况，“是具有极其重大的意义的”，“我们对它的意义，并不是完全了解的”。可是，腊斯克之流的美帝国主义分子，却又贼心不死，他们还露骨地叫嚷要给中国的一小撮反革命修正主义分子以“温和而明显的鼓励”，说什么“美国的利益在于出现另外某种中国”。他们这些话，充分暴露了美帝国主义敌视中国人民的狼子野心。美帝国主义的这种迷梦和幻想，必将在无情的历史面前碰得粉碎。
    无法阻挡文化大革命巨大影响
    帝国主义者最害怕的是，中国无产阶级文化大革命对各国人民革命斗争发生巨大的影响，特别是害怕促进他们本国的无产阶级和广大革命人民起来造他们的反，革他们的命。一些资产阶级报刊的评论明显地反映了约翰逊之流的这种恐惧和不安的心情。有的评论说，中国通过这场文化大革命“将成为一个对世界各地人民具有吸引力的模范的新社会”。有的认为，由毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民将“坚持革命的政策”，“毫不妥协”地坚持反对帝国主义的斗争，并且惊呼这将“对世界局势发生重大的影响”。有的说，在这场文化大革命中，“中国正在动员人民做好抵御美国侵略的准备”。有的惶惑不安地说，“中国正在燃烧革命之火”，“亚洲上空的雷声显得更响亮了”。
    毛主席教导我们，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。毛主席说：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命受到帝国主义和反动派疯狂的攻击，这真是一件大好事。目前，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流正冲破一切阻力，一泻千里地向前推进。在中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利面前，让以美帝国主义为首的全世界的反动势力发抖吧！
