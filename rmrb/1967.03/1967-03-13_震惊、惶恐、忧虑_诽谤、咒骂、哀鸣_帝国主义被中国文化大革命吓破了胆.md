Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has shaken the old world with its thunderous force. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, hundreds of millions of Chinese people, in this great revolution, have displayed great revolutionary spirit, sweeping away all the remaining filth of the exploiting classes from the land of China, and sweeping away all the monsters and demons. The great victories achieved in this revolution have greatly inspired the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, fiercely striking at the crumbling rule of the reactionary forces headed by U.S. imperialism, and sounding the death knell for them even more loudly. As the people of the whole of China and the revolutionary people of the whole world cheer together for this great historical feat of mankind, imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are in a state of extreme panic, sensing that their doom is approaching faster.

Malicious Slander Cannot Conceal Inner Terror

Imperialists, first and foremost American imperialists, have been terrified by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Since the beginning of this revolution, they have mobilized all their propaganda machines to slander and defame the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, spreading rumors and slanders, and stirring up anti-China hysteria. They have also mobilized a large number of manpower and resources, paying close attention and closely following the developments of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and its "impact on the outside world" and its "relationship with American national interests." They "feel confused and shocked, and at the same time, they are worried." They are very afraid that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will make socialist China an unshakable iron fortress, completely shattering the imperialist dream of "peaceful evolution" in China. They are even more worried that the sparks of this revolution will spread to various parts of the world, promoting the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, and thus accelerating their own doom.

The imperialists' vicious slanders and malicious attacks on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, no matter how ferocious they may be, cannot conceal their cowardly and terrified appearance. After the publication of the communiqu√© of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially since the Red Guards of China have marched onto the streets with great enthusiasm, sweeping away the "four olds" of the exploiting classes and establishing the "four news" of the proletariat, the imperialists have been completely thrown into disarray and have become even more restless. On the one hand, they pretend to be calm and try every means to belittle the great significance and far-reaching influence of this cultural revolution, acting as if the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is just a "trifling matter." However, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk in a meeting of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee had to say worriedly: "Important things are happening in China." Many U.S. officials and bourgeois newspapers also have to admit that the Cultural Revolution in China is "the most important thing in the world today," and it has "far-reaching significance" for the next decade and for the whole world.

Colluding with Soviet Revisionism to Oppose China is Futile

As the Cultural Revolution in our country continues to develop victoriously, the imperialist leaders like Johnson and Rusk have become even more furious. They have intensified their collusion with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, using every opportunity to engage in anti-China crimes. U.S. newspapers have reprinted a large number of anti-China statements and articles from the Soviet revisionists, openly advocating for closer U.S.-Soviet collusion to jointly oppose China. These anti-China "heroes" have all directed their attacks at the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and our great leader Chairman Mao, further exposing their reactionary faces of hostility towards the Chinese people and the cause of human progress.

It is not surprising that the imperialists are frantically attacking the Cultural Revolution in China and stirring up anti-China hysteria. Many Western bourgeois newspapers have revealed their true intentions in opposing the Cultural Revolution in China. The U.S. *Washington Star* said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is "more harmful than beneficial" to Western countries. The British *Sunday Telegraph* exclaimed that the Cultural Revolution in China is "a declaration of war on the entire Western world." Some bourgeois newspapers also admitted that the purpose of the Cultural Revolution in China is to "attempt to eliminate feudal, bourgeois, and Soviet revisionist influences" (U.S. *Washington Post*), the Chinese people are determined to "prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism" (British "Reuters"), "to do what the Soviet Union has not been able to do, to prevent the revisionist disease in advance" (Japanese *Mainichi Shimbun*), and to build China into a revolutionary model that stands in opposition to the Soviet Union, which has restored capitalism (*Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*).

The Dream of "Peaceful Evolution" is Completely Shattered

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great power of Mao Zedong Thought has been demonstrated, and the fact that the broad masses of revolutionary youth, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, are striving to temper themselves into staunch successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the storm of class struggle, has made the imperialists tremble with fear. While they are maliciously slandering our people's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and cursing the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, they have to admit that this Cultural Revolution in China will "produce a new type of person with Mao Zedong Thought" and make the Chinese people "able to withstand various capitalist tricks and schemes in the coming years." They even lament that through this Cultural Revolution, "Chinese youth can be immune" in avoiding bourgeois influences, and Chinese youth will take over the "torch of the Chinese revolution."

The imperialists and reactionaries of various countries are very annoyed by the powerful promotion of socialist construction by the Cultural Revolution in our country. They realize that the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in China will make China even more solid and powerful, and thus more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Therefore, they maliciously distort right and wrong, and erase the great promoting role of this Cultural Revolution in our country for production and construction. In fact, the imperialists' nonsense is not worth refuting. The whole world can see that this magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is powerfully promoting the victorious advance of our country's socialist construction. In the past year, our country's industrial and agricultural production fronts have been reporting victories, presenting a prosperous and thriving scene. Especially, our country successfully conducted three nuclear weapon tests last year, marking that our country's scientific and national defense forces are developing at an even faster pace, powerfully refuting the imperialists' slanders against our country. The U.S. *Christian Science Monitor* reluctantly admitted, "Now it seems that China is moving towards a new upheaval on the economic front." The Japanese *Economist* believes that in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution in China, "there will be a new leap in production and construction."

Since this year, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has entered a broader and deeper stage, and has entered the crucial moment of the struggle for power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the imperialist masters have become even more anxious and restless. They have to admit that this struggle will uproot the roots of revisionism and shatter the illusions of the U.S. imperialists' "peaceful evolution" plot in China. Rusk said in early February with great distress, "The situation in China is of extremely great significance," and "we do not fully understand its significance." However, the U.S. imperialist elements like Rusk are still not giving up, and they blatantly shout to give "gentle and obvious encouragement" to a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in China, saying that "the interests of the United States lie in the emergence of another kind of China." These words fully expose the wolfish ambitions of U.S. imperialism to oppose the Chinese people. The delusions and illusions of U.S. imperialism will be shattered before the relentless march of history.

Unable to Stop the Great Influence of the Cultural Revolution

What the imperialists fear the most is that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will have a great impact on the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, especially that it will promote the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people in their own countries to rise up against them and overthrow them. Some bourgeois newspaper commentaries clearly reflect the fear and anxiety of Johnson and his ilk. Some commentaries say that China, through this Cultural Revolution, "will become a model of a new society that attracts people from all over the world." Some believe that the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will "persist in revolutionary policies" and "uncompromisingly" oppose the struggle against imperialism, and exclaim that this will "have a great impact on the world situation." Some say that in this Cultural Revolution, "China is mobilizing the people to prepare to resist U.S. aggression." Some anxiously say, "China is burning the fire of revolution," and "the thunder in the sky over Asia is getting louder."

Chairman Mao teaches us that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. Chairman Mao said: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us as utterly worthless, then it is even better, then it proves that we not only have drawn a clear line with the enemy, but also proves that our work has been very successful."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is being fiercely attacked by imperialism and reactionaries, which is indeed a great thing. Currently, the unprecedented torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward, breaking through all obstacles. In the face of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, let the reactionary forces of the world led by U.S. imperialism tremble!
