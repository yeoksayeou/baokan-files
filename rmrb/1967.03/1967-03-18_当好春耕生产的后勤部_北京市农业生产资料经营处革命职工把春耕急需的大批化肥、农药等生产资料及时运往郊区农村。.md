Revolutionary workers of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Production Materials Management Office have timely transported large quantities of urgently needed fertilizers, pesticides, and other production materials to the suburban rural areas for spring plowing.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Production Materials Management Office has resolutely responded to the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong to "grasp revolution and promote production." While focusing on revolution, they have timely allocated and transported large quantities of urgently needed fertilizers, pesticides, and other production materials to the suburban rural areas, providing strong support for spring plowing production.

This year, the allocation of fertilizers by the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Production Materials Management Office, with the joint efforts of the proletarian revolutionary faction within the office and the revolutionary staff of the suburban supply and marketing cooperatives, has been earlier and in larger quantities than in previous years. Statistics show that the amount of fertilizers transported to the suburban rural areas has reached over 100,000 tons, an increase of 80% compared to the same period last year, ensuring the need for fertilizers for spring-sown crops, vegetables, and wheat greening. The amount of pesticides transported to the suburbs has reached over 4,000 tons. The supply of small agricultural tools for spring plowing is abundant, and the variety is relatively complete.

This year, the area for spring-sown vegetables in Beijing has expanded, and the demand for vegetable seeds has increased. They have actively organized purchases and found ways to procure over 100,000 jin of various spring vegetable seeds from various places.

The revolutionary faction of this unit has also actively collaborated with the revolutionary staff of the suburban supply and marketing cooperatives to serve the convenience of farmers and production. They have broken through the old frameworks set by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party that are not conducive to production and established a new revolutionary order. For example, for pesticides transported from other places, they have adopted the method of distributing goods at the station and directly delivering them to the districts and counties.

To make the work of supporting spring plowing production even better, they have recently organized a group of revolutionary workers to directly go to the front lines of spring plowing production in the suburbs, working with the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and distribution stores to investigate and understand the supply and demand situation of spring plowing production materials and the maintenance situation of small agricultural tools and pesticide equipment.

    当好春耕生产的后勤部
    北京市农业生产资料经营处革命职工把春耕急需的大批化肥、农药等生产资料及时运往郊区农村。
    据新华社十七日讯 北京市农业生产资料经营处的无产阶级革命派，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，他们在狠抓革命的同时，把春耕急需的大批化肥、农药等生产资料及时调运到郊区农村，有力地支援了春耕生产。
    今年，北京市农业生产资料经营处对化肥的调拨，在处内无产阶级革命派和郊区供销社广大革命职工的共同努力下，时间比历年都早，数量比历年都大。据统计，目前调运到郊区农村的化肥达十万吨以上，比去年同期增加百分之八十，做到了保证春播作物、蔬菜和小麦返青用肥的需要。调运到郊区的农药，已达四千多吨。春耕小农具的供应量很充足，品种也比较齐全。
    今年北京市春播蔬菜面积扩大，菜籽需要量增多。他们大力组织采购，想方设法从各地购进各种春菜籽十万多斤。
    这个单位的革命派还主动地和郊区供销社的广大革命职工相配合，做到方便农民，方便生产。他们打破了过去一些党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派规定的不利于生产的旧框框，创立了革命的新秩序。例如从外地调运来的农药，他们采用了车站分货的办法，直接运送到区县。
    为了把支援春耕生产的工作做得好上加好，他们最近还组织了一批革命职工，直接深入郊区春耕生产第一线，协同基层供销社、分销店调查了解春耕生产资料供需情况和小农具、农药器械维修情况。
