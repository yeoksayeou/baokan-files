In the evening, a bicycle arrived at the home of the poor and lower-middle class association group leader, Wang Xiaoyi. By the sound of the bell, Xiaoyi knew the postman had come, so he put down his chopsticks and went to greet him. The postman handed him a red-bordered newspaper and said with a smile, “Xiaoyi, I’ve brought you good news!” “What is it?” Xiaoyi opened the newspaper and exclaimed, “Ah, it’s a letter from the Party Central Committee, it’s Chairman Mao sending us timely rain!” Xiaoyi forgot to say goodbye to the postman and began to read. He read it several times in one breath, then looked up to find the postman had already left. Xiaoyi thought, this is big news, we can’t delay. I must go find team leader Erqiu right away. With that thought, he didn’t even finish his meal and set off towards Erqiu’s house. Why did Xiaoyi go to Erqiu? There’s not much to say. A while back, everyone put up some big-character posters criticizing Erqiu. The criticism was right, but he just couldn’t see it that way and felt everyone was being too harsh. When working in the fields, he worked hard on his own, but he didn’t put much effort into managing the team’s affairs. Because of this, Xiaoyi had talked to him several times, but Erqiu didn’t improve much, so Xiaoyi had to take on more responsibilities for the team’s affairs, but this wasn’t a long-term solution! Xiaoyi read the letter from the Party Central Committee and thought, Erqiu, this time you should understand!

Wang Xiaoyi arrived at Erqiu’s doorstep. Erqiu was squatting at the door reading a newspaper. As soon as he saw Xiaoyi, he stood up, his face showing a mix of smiles and embarrassment. Before Xiaoyi could speak, Erqiu hurriedly said, “Xiaoyi, don’t say anything. I’ll make a self-criticism tonight.”

Wang Xiaoyi said, “Just making a self-criticism is enough? The important thing is that we need to quickly discuss the spring plowing.”

“Right!” Erqiu agreed eagerly.

The two turned and went inside Erqiu’s house to discuss.

By the time the lamp was lit, Xiaoyi and Erqiu entered the clubhouse. The clubhouse was already full of people, and everyone was unusually punctual. Many people were holding the letter from the Party Central Committee. Erqiu stood in the middle and loudly said, “Comrades, I will first make a self-criticism to everyone…”

Wang Xiaoyi immediately interrupted, “Self-criticism can wait! Right now, let’s all study the letter from the Party Central Committee, and then we can discuss the spring plowing, okay?”

“Good!” Everyone agreed in unison.

Wang Xiaoyi read the letter from the Party Central Committee word by word. The community members then began to speak. Everyone said, this letter is like a timely rain in a drought; the Party Central Committee is so busy, but they still care about the production team, what more do we have to say! We must work hard to repay Chairman Mao… As they talked, they naturally started giving Erqiu some advice. But Erqiu was different this time, the more he listened, the more he felt the community’s criticism was right. After everyone finished speaking, he stood up and said to everyone, “Everyone’s advice is good, I will reflect on it. Tomorrow, we will start early and go to the fields. Now, let me talk about our spring production plan…”

Everyone agreed enthusiastically.

The next day, before dawn, the community members gathered at the village entrance. As they marched towards the fields, a platoon of soldiers carrying hoes and pickaxes, singing “The Three-Eight Work Style Song,” came walking. The leading soldier said to the community members, “Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have sent us to support spring plowing!” The community members were overjoyed. Erqiu grabbed the soldier’s hand and said, “You’ve come just in time!”

Xiaoyi said, “Not only will you help us with the work, but more importantly, you political teachers have come to us!”

The soldier said, “No, we are here to learn from the poor and lower-middle class peasants.”

The two groups naturally merged into one.

Upon reaching the field, a soldier hung a quotation board on a large tree and proposed to everyone, “Comrades, let’s first study Chairman Mao’s teachings, okay?”

“Agreed.” Everyone agreed in unison.

Under the soldier’s leadership, everyone read aloud Chairman Mao’s words to the people:

“At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leaders, cadres, and people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year.”

After reading the quotation, Erqiu rubbed his hands and said, “Hey, watch me.”

Xiaoyi immediately smiled and said, “It’s not just about watching you, it’s about watching all of us.”

“Right! Right!” Erqiu announced to everyone, “By militia class, Class One goes to North Slope, Class Two goes to South Marsh, and Class Three stays here. Let’s start, work!”

Instantly, the fields were filled with spring plowing teams. Red flags fluttered, silver hoes danced, and songs, labor slogans, and the sounds of plowing cattle rose and fell in harmony…

A fiery red sun rose from the horizon.

    及时雨

    傍晚，一辆自行车来到了贫协小组长王小乙的家门口。听那铃声，小乙知道邮递员来了，便撂下饭碗迎了上去。邮递员顺手递给他一张套红的报纸，笑着说：“小乙，给你送喜讯来了！”“是啥哩？”小乙打开报纸一看，啊，是党中央给咱来的信，是毛主席给咱送来的及时雨啊！小乙忘了跟邮递员打招呼，便埋头读起来。一口气读了几遍，抬头一看，邮递员早就走了。小乙一想，这大事儿可误不得，咱得马上找队长二秋去。想罢，饭也没吃完，抬脚便往二秋家走去。小乙找二秋干什么？说来话也不长。前一段时间，大伙给二秋贴了一些大字报，本来社员批得对，可他老是转不过弯来，总觉得大伙儿批得过了头，也就有了情绪。在地里干活儿，自己埋头干得挺好，就是管队里的事儿不带劲。为了这个，小乙找他谈过几次话，二秋还是改进不大，小乙只好对队里的事儿多操点心了，可这总不是长久之计呀！小乙看完这封党中央的来信，心里想：二秋呀！这回你该开窍了吧！
    王小乙走到二秋的家门口，二秋正蹲在门口看报呢。他一见小乙，就站了起来，脸上带着笑容，这笑容里可有几分羞惭。他没等小乙开口，就抢先说：“小乙哥，你别说了，晚上我检讨。”
    王小乙说：“光检讨就行啦！要紧的是，咱们得赶紧合计合计春耕的事。”
      “对！”二秋连连应承着。
    两人扭身进二秋家商量开了。
    掌灯的时候，小乙和二秋走进了俱乐部。俱乐部里的人早满了，人到得可是少有的齐整，许多人都拿着党中央来的那封信。二秋往当中一站，亮开嗓门说：
      “社员同志们，我先向大伙儿检讨……”
    王小乙把话头马上拦过去说：
      “检讨？检讨有的是时间！这会儿咱大伙儿先学党中央给咱们的信，然后大伙儿合计合计春耕的事儿好不好？”
      “好！”全体社员齐声同意。
    王小乙一个字一个字地把党中央的信念了一遍。社员们接着就发开言了。大家都说，这封信可真象旱天里及时来了个透犁雨；党中央那么忙，工作都做到生产队里来了，我们还有啥说的！不好好干还能对得起毛主席他老人家……谈着谈着，也就很自然地朝着二秋提了些意见。可二秋这会儿不一样了，他越听越觉着社员批评得对，大伙儿一讲完，他站起来向大伙儿说：
      “大家意见很好，我以后检查。明儿，咱们起个早五更上地，这会儿给大家说说咱春耕生产的打算。……”
    大伙听了，齐声说好。
    第二天，天蒙蒙亮，社员在村头聚齐了。当他们整队往地里走的时候，一队解放军荷着锄，扛着镢头，唱着《三八作风歌》走来了。带头的解放军战士向社员们说：“毛主席、党中央派我们支援春耕来了！”这一下社员们可高兴了。二秋一把抓住战士的手说：
    “你们来得可正是个当口啊！”
    小乙说：
    “不但帮我们干活，更重要的，你们这些政治老师可送上门来了！”
    战士说：
      “不，我们是来向贫下中农学习的。”
    这两支队伍很自然地插在一起了。
    走到地头。一个战士把背着的语录牌挂在一棵大树上，向大伙儿提议说：
      “同志们，我们先学学毛主席的教导好不？”
      “同意。”大家齐声赞同。
    在战士的带领下，大伙齐声朗读毛主席对大家讲的贴心话：
    “目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”
    读完语录，二秋磨磨掌说：
      “嗨！看我的。”
    小乙马上笑着说：
    “不是看你一个人的，要看咱们大伙儿的。”
      “对！对！”二秋向大伙儿宣布：“按民兵班，一班去北坡，二班到南洼，三班留这儿。咱们开始，干！”
    霎时，田野布满了春耕的队伍。只见红旗招展，银锄飞舞，歌声、劳动口号和?喝牛的声音此起彼落……。
    一轮火红的太阳从地平线上升起来了。
