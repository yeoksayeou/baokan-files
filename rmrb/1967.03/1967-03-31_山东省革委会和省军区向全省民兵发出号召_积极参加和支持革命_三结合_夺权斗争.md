The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Shandong Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army jointly announce. The full text is as follows:

Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses in our province, implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, has waged a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and has already achieved decisive victories. However, the enemy "will not resign themselves to their defeat, they will make a final struggle." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are colluding with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as the ghosts and snakes in society, to sabotage the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, divert the direction of the struggle, and attempt to make a last-ditch resistance. We must keep our eyes open and be a hundred times more vigilant, and we must not let the enemy's plots succeed!

At this critical moment in the struggle to seize power, our great leader Chairman Mao has put forward the correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. The editorial in the fifth issue of 1967 of the "Red Flag" magazine states: "From top to bottom, all units that need to seize power must have military representatives or militia representatives participate to form a 'three-in-one' combination." "County-level and above should have military representatives, while communes and below should have militia representatives." According to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the importance of our militia work has been further elevated, the tasks of the militia have become heavier, and the role of the militia has become greater. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for the militia. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's concern and trust, and we must resolutely complete this new and glorious political task.

Therefore, the announcement is made to all militia in the province:

1. Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must study "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant works such as "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" as our guiding principles, and also study the relevant editorials in "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and "Liberation Army Daily." We must closely combine the actual situation of the Cultural Revolution, learn in the struggle, and use in the struggle, to always maintain the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the proletariat. While seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must also seize the power of the "self" in our minds and carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls. We must raise the struggle against the "self" and the establishment of the "public" to the level of the struggle between the two lines and the two roads. We must always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

2. Actively participate in and support the proletarian revolutionary masses' great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" seizure of power struggle. Our great commander Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses is also a call to the militia. The broad militia must, in the struggle, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, stand firmly, and resolutely and unambiguously participate in and support the proletarian revolutionary masses' united seizure of power struggle. We must actively participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs. Militia representatives participating in the revolutionary "three-in-one" should be democratically elected by the militia congress or militia representatives' meeting and approved by the higher-level people's armed department. Militia representatives must actively fulfill their duties and, together with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, seize and use power well.

Rural militia must resolutely implement the Central Committee's directive not to carry out seizure of power struggles in production brigades and teams during the busy spring planting season.

3. Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and resolutely implement the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Across the Country." Bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production. Militia on the industrial and transportation fronts must be full of revolutionary enthusiasm, take the lead in doing a good job in production, and ensure that every month and every quarter, the state plan is completed and exceeded with high quality. Militia in rural people's communes must "pay attention to the season" and "not violate the agricultural time," and with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," urgently mobilize, play the role of the vanguard, and take the lead in firing the first shot of spring planting production to lay a good foundation for achieving a bumper harvest for the whole year.

4. Resolutely defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and consolidate the revolutionary regime. The militia is an important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a mass revolutionary armed force, and a powerful assistant and strong reserve force for the People's Liberation Army. The broad militia must, together with the People's Liberation Army, be ready at any time to smash the counter-revolutionary tide initiated by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must work closely with the People's Liberation Army and the public security organs to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We must defend the great achievements of the Four Clean-ups movement and not allow the cadres who took the capitalist road and were removed from power during the Four Clean-ups movement to stage a comeback. We must strengthen the guard of important targets and ensure the safety of state and collective property. We must remain highly vigilant against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, seriously strengthen our preparedness, defend the coastal and air defenses, and be ready at any time to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to annihilate any daring invaders. We must prevent class enemies from plotting and inciting militia organizations to direct their spears at the people. The militia must model themselves on and strictly follow and implement the Party's policies and maintain state discipline.

5. Adjust and strengthen the militia organization. All factories, mines, enterprises, production brigades, party and government agencies, and mass organizations should, on the basis of the great alliance of revolutionary masses, adjust the militia organization, strengthen leadership, purify the ranks, and improve the combat effectiveness of the militia. Militia cadres and armed militia members should be composed of revolutionary workers, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and other laborers who have been tested in the movement.

6. Learn from the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army is a people's army created by Chairman Mao, unique in the world, and highly proletarianized. All militia on various fronts in the province should seize this good opportunity when the People's Liberation Army is strongly supporting the revolutionary leftists and supporting industrial and agricultural production, and widely carry out activities to learn from the People's Liberation Army. We must learn from the People's Liberation Army to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, loyally implement Chairman Mao's political line for building the army, insist on putting politics in command, the four firsts, and the three-eight style, the three great democracies, and strictly observe the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, and improve the militias' revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline.

All levels of people's armed cadres and all militia comrades in the province, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, make the greatest contributions to carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to achieving double victories in revolution and production! Let us strive to make the militia work three-in-one more solid, and turn the militia organization into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    山东省革委会和省军区向全省民兵发出号召
    积极参加和支持革命“三结合”夺权斗争
    新华社济南三十日电　山东省革命委员会、中国人民解放军山东省军区联合通告。全文如下：
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我省无产阶级革命派大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是，敌人“决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，正在和社会上的地富反坏右分子、牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，破坏无产阶级革命派大联合，破坏革命的“三结合”，转移斗争的大方向，企图负隅顽抗。我们要擦亮眼睛，百倍警惕，决不能让阶级敌人的阴谋得逞！
    正当夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们的伟大领袖毛主席提出了革命的“三结合”的正确方针。《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期社论《论革命的“三结合”》指出：“从上至下，凡要夺权的单位，都要有军队代表或民兵代表参加，组成‘三结合’。”“县以上都派军队代表，公社以下都派民兵代表”。根据毛主席这一最新指示，我们民兵工作的重要性更提高了，民兵担负的任务更加重了，民兵的作用更大了。这是毛主席对民兵的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞。我们决不能辜负毛主席的关怀和信任，一定要最坚决地完成这一项新的重大而又光荣的政治任务。
    为此，通告全省民兵：
    一、更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段。要把“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作作为座右铭来学，并学习《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》的有关社论，要紧密结合文化大革命的实际，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，永远保持无产阶级的革命造反精神，在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，也要夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，在灵魂深处闹革命。要把破“私”立“公”提高到两条路线、两条道路斗争上去认识。要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    二、积极参加和支持无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”的夺权斗争。我们的伟大统帅毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，也是对民兵的号召。广大民兵在斗争中一定要分清敌我，站稳立场，坚定地、毫不含糊地参加和支持无产阶级革命派的联合夺权斗争。要积极参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构。参加革命的“三结合”的民兵代表，应该经过民兵大会或民兵代表会民主选举，和上一级人民武装部批准。民兵代表要积极履行职责，和革命群众、革命干部一起，掌好权，用好权。
    农村民兵要坚决执行中共中央关于在春耕大忙期间，生产大队和生产队，不要进行夺权斗争的指示。
    三、坚决响应毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》、《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，夺取革命、生产双胜利，工业交通战线上的民兵，要鼓足革命干劲，带头搞好生产，保证每月每季都高质量地完成和超额完成国家计划。农村人民公社的民兵，“必须注意季节”，要“不违农时”，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，紧急动员起来，发挥突击队作用，带头打响春耕生产第一炮，为夺取全年农业大丰收奠定一个好基础。
    四、坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命，巩固革命政权。民兵是无产阶级专政的重要工具，是群众性的革命武装，是人民解放军的有力助手和强大后备力量。广大民兵要同人民解放军一起，随时准备粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掀起的反革命逆流。要大力协同人民解放军和公安机关，坚决镇压地、富、反、坏、右分子的反革命活动。要保卫四清运动的伟大成果，决不许在四清运动中下台的走资本主义道路的干部反攻倒算。要加强对重要目标的守护，保障国家和集体财产的安全。要对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派保持高度警惕，认真地加强战备，保卫海防、空防，随时准备配合人民解放军消灭敢于来犯的敌人。要严防阶级敌人阴谋策动、挑动民兵组织把矛头指向人民。民兵要模范地遵守和执行党的方针、政策，维护国家法纪。
    五、调整健全民兵组织。各厂矿、企（事）业、生产大队、党政机关和民众团体，应当在革命群众组织实现大联合的基础上，调整民兵组织，健全领导，纯洁队伍，提高民兵的战斗力。民兵干部和持枪民兵，应该由经过运动考验的革命工人、贫农、下中农和其他劳动者担任。
    六、向解放军学习。人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的、举世无双的、非常无产阶级化的人民军队。全省各条战线上的民兵，要乘解放军大力支援革命左派和支援工农业生产的大好时机，广泛开展学习解放军的活动。要学习解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，忠实执行毛主席政治建军路线，坚持突出政治、四个第一，发扬三八作风、三大民主，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意的光荣传统，提高民兵的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    各级人民武装干部和全省民兵同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为夺取革命、生产的双胜利，做出最大贡献！让我们为把民兵工作三落实搞得更好，把民兵组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
