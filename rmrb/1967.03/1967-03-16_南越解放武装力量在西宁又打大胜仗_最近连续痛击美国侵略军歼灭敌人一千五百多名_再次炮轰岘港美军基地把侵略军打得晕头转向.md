Liberation forces in South Vietnam achieve major victory in Xining. In recent days, they have continuously struck and annihilated over 1,500 enemy troops. Again, they bombarded the U.S. military base in Da Nang, leaving the invaders in disarray.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 15 - According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the brave and skilled liberation forces in Xining Province, South Vietnam, have recently continued to strike back against the "sweeping" operations of the U.S. invaders and their lackeys, annihilating over 1,500 enemy troops, destroying or damaging 234 military vehicles, destroying 43 cannons, and shooting down, destroying, or damaging 6 enemy aircraft.

On the night of March 5, the liberation forces launched a fierce artillery attack on the base of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade and the Australian and South Korean lackeys in the Da Xi area of northern Xining Province. Preliminary reports indicate that the liberation forces annihilated 700 U.S. invaders and Australian and South Korean lackeys, completely destroyed three enemy artillery positions, and destroyed 22 cannons of various calibers. Twenty military vehicles were hit and set on fire.

On March 9, guerrillas in the Bien Hoa area annihilated 45 U.S. troops in an ambush, destroyed two armored vehicles, and shot down one enemy aircraft.

On March 10, the liberation forces launched a fierce attack on two companies of U.S. troops west of Bau Giua, killing and wounding 170 enemy troops, destroying 52 military vehicles and 10 cannons. On the same day, guerrillas in the Da Nha area also destroyed two enemy armored vehicles.

On the night of March 10, the liberation forces attacked a U.S. brigade stationed in the Tam Ban area. The liberation forces' shells rained down on the enemy's base like a storm. As soon as the artillery fire ceased, the liberation forces' spearhead units swiftly attacked the enemy's command post, artillery positions, and parking lot, causing the enemy's command post and communication center to fall into chaos. Preliminary reports indicate that in this attack, the liberation forces annihilated over 300 U.S. invaders, destroyed 152 tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles, and destroyed 11 cannons of various calibers.

On March 11, the liberation forces attacked a U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade company base northeast of Tam Ban, killing and wounding over 150 enemy troops.

On March 12, guerrillas in the Bien Hoa area destroyed two enemy aircraft.

According to a supplementary report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the liberation forces in Xining Province, on the night of February 28, annihilated 200 U.S. troops in a raid in the Thuyonghung area, destroying 29 M-41 tanks and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15 - Saigon news: The liberation forces in South Vietnam launched another fierce artillery attack on the U.S. airbase in Da Nang, Quang Nam Province, in the early hours of March 15, causing the U.S. invaders to fall into chaos and forcing the airport to close.

According to Western news agencies, this is the second time in 16 days that the liberation forces have launched a fierce artillery attack on this airfield. The shells fired by the liberation forces rained down on the airfield, hitting several aircraft and an oil storage area. A fighter jet that was about to take off was also hit by a shell. After the shelling ended, a U.S. Air Force spokesman tried to downplay the losses. He sheepishly said, "There have been 19 U.S. Air Force casualties," and some aircraft have been destroyed or damaged.

Sixteen days earlier, on the night of February 27, the liberation forces had fiercely bombarded the U.S. airbase in Da Nang, annihilating over 500 U.S. invaders, destroying 26 U.S. aircraft, and destroying 22 military vehicles.

According to another report, the liberation forces, on the morning of March 13, used mortars to shell Kon Tum City, killing and wounding 43 U.S. invaders. On the same night and the following morning (March 14), the liberation forces also shelled a U.S. outpost, command post, special forces camp, and support base southwest of Kon Tum, causing over 150 U.S. invaders to be killed or wounded. On March 14, a liberation armed trawler, 40 kilometers off the coast of Quang Ngai City, damaged a U.S. patrol boat.
