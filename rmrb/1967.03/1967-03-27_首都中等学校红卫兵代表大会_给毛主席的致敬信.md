To the most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao:

Your most loyal Red Guards, singing the praises of "The East Is Red," greet the rising red sun, filled with boundless happiness and boundless respect, we report to you—the most red, most red red sun in our hearts, our most, most respected red commander—the good news:

Our capital middle schools Red Guards representative conference, under your wise leadership and warm care, amidst the songs of great alliance of the revolutionary masses and the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, has been born gloriously by your side! We joyously cheer, we sing with abandon, celebrating the new victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you! Singing the resounding victory song of your brilliant thoughts!

Beloved Chairman Mao, our most, most respected red commander:

It is you who personally ignited the unprecedented blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It is you who keenly discovered the young shoots of the Red Guards just emerging from the eastern horizon, possessing powerful vitality. Your resolute support and powerful voice have made the great Red Guards movement sweep across the entire country like thunder, and shake the world.

It is you who gave us the sharpest weapon of struggle, enabling us, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, smashing the white terror and mad counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line; we raised high the banner of "Rebellion is justified," with great daring and heroic spirit, "fighting" out of the school gates, entering society, thoroughly smashing the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and establishing the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, changing the appearance of our entire society.

It is you and your closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, who inspected the powerful ranks of the Red Guards time and again, giving us immense encouragement and boundless strength.

Most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao, it is you who lead us forward bravely amidst the great winds and waves! It is your sunlight and dew that nurture us to grow strong in struggle. All of this, how can it not make us, from the bottom of our hearts, express our boundless love, boundless faith, boundless admiration, and boundless loyalty to you!

Most, most respected Chairman Mao, as we look back on the arduous struggle of the past, we are fearless; as we look forward to the brilliant future, we are filled with boundless confidence. Under the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts, we middle school Red Guards have broken through countless obstacles and united more closely! We have fought together in unity!

Beloved Chairman Mao, our most, most respected red commander, we Red Guards deeply realize that our mission is heavy and our path is long. We resolutely follow your teachings: to care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We resolutely implement your policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, carrying forward the great revolutionary spirit of rebellion, grasping the broad direction of the struggle, and seizing back all the positions usurped by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We will fight these reactionaries down, smash them, and expose them. We will thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminate its poison, and uproot its social base. We will not allow anyone to negate the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely defend you, defend the proletarian headquarters headed by you.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the new stage of decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, you have issued the battle call of "Resume classes and carry on the revolution." We Red Guards will play a model leading role, resolutely respond, and resolutely carry it out. We will remember your teachings, strive to create conditions, and achieve the great alliance of the entire school based on teaching classes. We will unite all forces that can be united, forming a vast revolutionary army, and thoroughly complete the historical mission of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms in the school. Let the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts occupy all positions in middle schools, making middle schools into red fortresses for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

We will resolutely follow your teachings, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and take the People's Liberation Army as our model. We will study and apply your brilliant works actively, taking the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles. We will thoroughly criticize and transform the "self," making our organization into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, becoming a powerful reserve force for the People's Liberation Army.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Our most, most respected red commander, please rest assured that under your guidance, we have undergone the baptism of struggle, and we will definitely be able to withstand greater storms. Gunfire and cannonballs will not frighten us, sugar-coated bullets will not topple us, and tricks will not deceive us. We have a firm belief, we have the great daring spirit of the proletarian revolution, we have the great ambition and passion to carry the revolution through to the end. We will not be like the ephemeral figures in history, we vow to be screws that never rust, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the revolutionary people of the world wholeheartedly.

"Only heroes drive tigers and leopards, no heroes fear bears and wolves."

Most, most respected Chairman Mao, you have placed your hopes in us. Please rest assured, our generation will personally bury imperialism, sweep away all harmful creatures, and ensure that our proletarian dictatorship's iron-clad mountains and rivers remain unchanged for ten thousand generations.

Most, most respected Chairman Mao, you are the hope of the people, you are the lighthouse of the revolution, your great thoughts are the lifeline of revolutionary people. We Red Guards vow to take your thoughts as our guiding principles and implement them in action. We pledge to you: in life, we will fight to defend your brilliant thoughts; in death, we will dedicate ourselves to defending your brilliant thoughts! Forever loyal to you, loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line, until the seas dry up and the stones crumble, we will never change. "Dare to be killed, dare to pull the emperor off his horse." Anyone, no matter how high their position, how senior their status, or how great their reputation, if they oppose you, oppose your brilliant thoughts, we will resolutely overthrow them! Make them never rise again!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Our most, most respected red commander, a thousand words, ten thousand words, cannot express our boundless love and boundless respect for you. Let us raise high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and wish you, the red sun that never sets in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!
