The great storm of the “January Revolution” has swept across the entire country and shaken the world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The proletarian revolutionary masses have formed a mighty revolutionary army and launched a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary situation is excellent!

However, the enemy will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. They are always trying every means to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the reactionary economicism was smashed by the revolutionary masses, they now attempt to use the anarchist tendencies existing among some people to create divisions within the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries, to sabotage the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” and to sabotage the great alliance of the revolutionary masses. Therefore, we must give them a powerful rebuff.

Anarchism confuses two types of contradictions of a different nature, doubts everything, denies everything, rejects everything, and overthrows everything. When implementing the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” they propose: “All those in power should step aside.” Whoever combines with revolutionary cadres is a “new type of conservative.” They deny all authority, believing that obeying the leadership of the proletarian power-holders is a new type of “slavery,” advocating: “I will do whatever I want to do.”

Rejecting everything, denying everything, and overthrowing everything is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. In fact, there is no such thing in the world as rejecting everything and overthrowing everything. In a class society, everyone belongs to a certain class, and everyone’s thoughts belong to the ideological trend representing their class. They will not overthrow their own class and the ideological trend of their class. Anarchists are no exception.

Do anarchists doubt themselves, deny themselves, and overthrow themselves? Do anarchists really not want a government and really deny everything? Absolutely not! They merely want to do away with the proletarian government and the proletarian authority, while having a kingdom of the bourgeoisie and the authority of the bourgeoisie! Lenin pointed out long ago: “The worldview of the anarchists is a bourgeois worldview in disguise.” “Individualism is the foundation of the entire worldview of anarchism.” Therefore, the anarchist trend is a trend of the bourgeoisie, and their so-called “nothing,” their so-called “doubt everything” and “deny everything” are hypocritical, deceitful, and class-based.

The proletarian revolutionaries must establish proletarian authority. One of the historical lessons of the Paris Commune is that the revolutionary authority was not sufficiently used. Today, the proletarian revolutionaries must fully use revolutionary authority to establish a new revolutionary order. Engels once said: “If someone talks to me about power and concentration as if they are two things that must be condemned in any circumstances, then I think that such a person either does not know what revolution is, or is merely a revolutionary in words.” The anarchists are exactly such people. What is the authority of the proletarian revolutionaries? Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the highest authority of the proletariat, and the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the highest authority of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must establish the highest authority of the proletariat and will not allow anyone to oppose the authority of the proletariat.

Anarchism also vigorously advocates “liberalization” and “extreme democratization,” viewing democratic centralism and organizational discipline as mere “frameworks” to be “overthrown.” This is a completely absurd argument!

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Within the people, there must be freedom, and there must be discipline; there must be democracy, and there must be centralism. This unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism. Under this system, the people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom; at the same time, they must also discipline themselves with socialist discipline.” Revolutionary organizations desperately need strict organizational discipline and democratic centralism. Otherwise, it will cause disunity within the revolutionary organization and make the revolutionary organization lose its combat effectiveness. The anarchist advocacy of such “extreme democratization” and “liberalization” is actually a corrosive agent that splits, disintegrates, and sabotages the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, damaging the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organization. Chairman Mao said: “The danger of extreme democratization lies in damaging and even completely destroying the Party’s organization, weakening and even completely destroying the Party’s combat effectiveness, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, and thus causing the failure of the revolution.” Therefore, the proletarian revolutionaries will not allow the anarchist trend to spread. Currently, the localism, factionalism, extreme democratization, and lack of organizational consciousness manifested in our revolutionary ranks are, in essence, reflections of the anarchist trend. We must thoroughly criticize the anarchist trend, eliminate all its poisonous influences, and ensure the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The basis for the emergence of the anarchist trend is the bourgeois worldview, and its main market is the petty bourgeoisie and their intellectuals. The struggle between the proletarian revolutionaries and anarchism is a struggle between two worldviews. The worldview of petty bourgeois intellectuals, before they unite with the workers and peasants, can be said to belong to the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the anarchist trend has an influence on them. We must seriously study the works of Chairman Mao, dare to make a revolution in the depths of our souls, and overcome individualism. Only in this way can we become true revolutionaries.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary ranks! Let us, in the struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao’s works, remove the obstacles in our path, thoroughly criticize the anarchist trend, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    无政府主义思潮必须批判
    红彤
    伟大的“一月革命”的风暴席卷了全中国，震动了全世界。无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。无产阶级革命派组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，展开了夺权斗争。革命形势好得很！
    但是，敌人是不会自动退出历史舞台的。他们总是千方百计地破坏无产阶级文化大革命。当反动的经济主义被革命群众粉碎之后，他们又妄图利用一些人中存在的无政府主义，在无产阶级革命派内部制造分裂，破坏革命的“三结合”，破坏革命派的大联合。因此，我们必须给予有力的回击。
    无政府主义混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾，怀疑一切，否定一切，排斥一切，打倒一切。当实行革命的
  “三结合”时，他们就提出：“当权派统统靠边站”，谁和革命的领导干部结合，谁就是“新的保皇派”。他们否定一切权威，认为服从无产阶级当权派的领导就是新的“奴隶主义”，主张“我爱干什么就干什么”。
    排斥一切，否定一切，打倒一切，这是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的。其实，世界上根本就没有排斥一切、打倒一切的事情。在阶级社会中，每一个人都是属于一定阶级的，每一个人的思想也是属于代表本阶级的思潮的，他是不会打倒他自己的阶级和本阶级的思潮的。无政府主义者同样是如此。
    难道无政府主义者怀疑自己、否定自己、打倒自己吗？无政府主义真的不要政府，真的否定一切吗？绝不是！他们只不过是“无”无产阶级的政府，“无”无产阶级的权威，而有资产阶级之王国，有资产阶级的权威罢了！列宁早就指出：“无政府主义者的世界观，是改头换面的资产阶级世界观。”“个人主义是无政府主义整个世界观的基础。”因此，无政府主义思潮是资产阶级的一种思潮，他们的所谓“无”，所谓“怀疑一切”、“否定一切”是虚伪的，是骗人的，是有阶级性的。
    无产阶级革命派就是要树立无产阶级的权威。巴黎公社的历史教训之一就是革命的权威运用得太少了。今天，无产阶级革命派必须充分运用革命的权威来建立革命的新秩序。恩格斯曾经说过：“如果有人同我谈权力和集中象谈两个在任何情况下都须要斥责的东西，那末我认为，说这种话的人，或者是不知道什么叫革命，或者仅仅是个口头上的革命家。”无政府主义者正是这种角色。什么是无产阶级革命派的权威？马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想就是无产阶级的最高权威，以毛主席为代表的革命路线就是无产阶级文化大革命的最高权威。我们一定要树立无产阶级的最高权威，我们决不允许任何人反对无产阶级权威。
    无政府主义还极力鼓吹“自由化”和“极端民主化”，把民主集中制、组织纪律统统视为“框框”，都要“打倒”。这是极为荒谬的论调！
    毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。在这个制度下，人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己。”革命组织极需要有严密的组织纪律，极需要民主集中制。否则，就会使革命组织内部的团结涣散，就会使革命组织丧失战斗力。无政府主义鼓吹的这种“极端民主化”和“自由化”的论调，实际上是分裂、瓦解和破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，是损伤革命组织战斗力的腐蚀剂。毛主席说：“极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”因此，无产阶级革命派决不允许无政府主义的思潮泛滥。目前，在我们的革命队伍中所表现出来的本位主义、小团体主义、极端民主化、非组织观念等等，归结起来，实际上都是无政府主义思潮的反映。我们必须彻底批判无政府主义的思潮，清除其一切流毒，才能保证无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    无政府主义思潮产生的基础是资产阶级的世界观，它的主要市场是小资产阶级及其知识分子。无产阶级革命派同无政府主义的斗争是两种世界观的斗争。小资产阶级知识分子，在和工农相结合之前，他们的世界观，应当说，是属于资产阶级的。因此，无政府主义思潮对他们是有影响的。我们要成为无产阶级的革命派，必须认真学习毛主席著作，敢于在灵魂深处闹革命，革自己头脑中“私”字的命，克服个人主义。只有这样，才能成为真正的革命者。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们！让我们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，清除前进道路上的绊脚石，彻底批判无政府主义思潮，将文化大革命进行到底！
