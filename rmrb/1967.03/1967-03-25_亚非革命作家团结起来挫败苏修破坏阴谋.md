The Chinese Writers' Association strongly condemns the Soviet revisionists' plot to split the Asian and African writers' "Third Congress"
Asian and African revolutionary writers unite to defeat the Soviet revisionists' sabotage plot
Firmly believe that the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress to be held in Beijing will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher
The Soviet revisionists' split behavior thoroughly exposes their traitorous faces of leaning towards the U.S. imperialists and betraying the cause of Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism

New China News Agency, March 24th: The Chinese Writers' Association issued a statement on March 24th, strongly condemning the fake "Third Asian and African Writers' Congress" planned by the Soviet revisionist leadership in Beirut. This serious split behavior thoroughly exposes the Soviet revisionists' open betrayal of the Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism, their open sabotage of the Asian and African writers' movement, and their traitorous faces.

The statement expresses that the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress to be held in Beijing this year will certainly be a congress that raises the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, a revolutionary, combative, united, and victorious congress. As the host, Chinese writers will contribute their greatest efforts to the successful convening of the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The farce of the fake "Third Asian and African Writers' Congress" directed by the Soviet revisionist leadership is about to begin in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. The Soviet revisionists' serious split behavior shows that they are determined to openly oppose the Asian and African peoples and the vast number of revolutionary and progressive writers in Asia and Africa, and to openly sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement and the revolutionary cause of Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism.

The Chinese Writers' Association fully supports the statement issued by the Asian and African Writers' Permanent Bureau on March 21st regarding the fake "Third Congress," and resolutely condemns and exposes the Soviet revisionists' new despicable plot and crime.

Under the leadership of Senanayake, the Asian and African Writers' Permanent Bureau based in Colombo has, over the past eight years, with the active support of revolutionary and progressive writers from various Asian and African countries, carried out tremendous work. At many critical junctures, the Bureau led Asian and African writers to hold a series of large-scale fighting meetings. In particular, the emergency meeting held in Beijing in June last year to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation firmly supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and adopted more than thirty major resolutions supporting the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa, such as the resolution to firmly support the liberation struggle of the Palestinian Arab people, etc. It also published official journals in multiple languages, issued Asian and African collections, translated and published many excellent novels, poems, and other literary works reflecting the struggles of the peoples of various Asian and African countries; sent delegations of writers from the Permanent Bureau to visit various Asian and African countries many times, promoting bilateral exchanges, organizing literary exchange meetings, and greatly strengthening the mutual understanding and fighting friendship between writers and peoples of various Asian and African countries. Through these series of effective activities, it has made a valuable contribution to the Asian and African writers' movement and the cause of the liberation of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

Over the past eight years, the Asian and African writers' movement has gone through a glorious revolutionary and combative course, with a struggle between two lines running through it from beginning to end. Chinese writers and revolutionary and progressive writers from various Asian and African countries have always taken the Asian and African Writers' Permanent Bureau as the center, united together, fought together, and firmly adhered to the revolutionary line of opposing imperialism and neocolonialism led by the United States, resolutely supporting the liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples. They have repeatedly thwarted the Soviet revisionists' various threats, inducements, provocations, and sabotage plots, achieving one victory after another, and raising the banner of unity against imperialism higher and higher. All revolutionary and progressive writers who are loyal to the cause of the liberation of the Asian and African peoples and are patriotic and anti-imperialist have become stronger and stronger in the struggle, their ranks are constantly expanding, and their unity is constantly strengthening.

In contrast, the Soviet revisionists have shamelessly pursued a line of capitulationism and splitism over the past eight years, leaning towards the U.S. imperialists, betraying the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples, and sabotaging the Asian and African writers' movement. This time, in the process of plotting the fake "Third Congress," the Soviet revisionists have shamelessly begged for financial and economic aid from the U.S. imperialists' puppet, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, attempting to open the door for the U.S. imperialists to interfere with and control the Asian and African writers' movement. Their despicable deeds only expose their true faces as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Some Asian and African writers who were once deceived have awakened through their own experiences, recognized their enemies and friends in the struggle, spurned the Soviet revisionists, and stood together with the Asian and African writers who adhere to the line of unity against imperialism, fighting together.

"The seas are roaring with waves, and the winds and thunder are shaking the continents." Currently, the liberation struggles of the peoples of the two continents of Asia and Africa are surging like a storm, and the world is undergoing a great upheaval, a great division, and a great reorganization. The revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces are becoming increasingly clear. At this crucial historical juncture, the Soviet revisionists who have infiltrated the Asian and African writers' movement have brazenly carried out open splits, which is a good thing. The Soviet revisionists' open betrayal of the Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism, their open sabotage of the Asian and African writers' movement, and their open collusion with the U.S. imperialists only serve to thoroughly expose their traitorous faces, making the Asian and African peoples more aware of their true nature, ultimately leading them to a situation of being deserted by all, and accelerating their downfall. The Asian and African writers' movement, having eliminated the source of splitism within it, will certainly make its ranks more united, more powerful, and more vigorous.

In the struggle to develop the Asian and African writers' movement, Chinese writers have always received the trust and support of the vast number of revolutionary and progressive writers in Asia and Africa. Chinese writers, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always regarded supporting the revolutionary writers of various Asian and African countries, promoting the Asian and African writers' movement, and aiding the revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples as their glorious internationalist duty. The People's Republic of China, founded and led by Chairman Mao, is the base of the Asian and African revolutionary peoples and writers. The great, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao is sweeping away all the dirt and filth left over from the old society. The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is being further grasped by the 700 million Chinese people. After this proletarian cultural revolution, China, as the base of the Asian and African writers and the world people's revolutionary struggles, will be more consolidated and stronger. Chinese writers will also enter the ranks of the Asian and African writers' movement with a new revolutionary posture and formation. The Chinese people and Chinese writers will certainly better fulfill their internationalist duty, making greater contributions to the Asian and African writers' movement and the cause of the Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism.

The emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in 1966, attended by representatives from 53 Asian and African countries and regions, solemnly announced that the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress will be held in Beijing this year. This reflects the common wish of the Asian and African revolutionary peoples and the high trust and support of the Asian and African revolutionary and progressive writers for the Chinese people. As the host, Chinese writers will contribute their greatest efforts to the successful convening of the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress.

We firmly believe that the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress will certainly be a congress that raises the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, a revolutionary, combative, united, and victorious congress.

All revolutionary and progressive Asian and African writers, unite to thwart the Soviet revisionists' plot to hold the fake "Third Congress" and all their sabotage activities, and strive together to welcome the successful convening of the Third Asian and African Writers' Congress!

    我作协强烈谴责苏修策划亚非作家伪“三大”的分裂罪行
    亚非革命作家团结起来挫败苏修破坏阴谋
    坚信在北京举行的第三次亚非作家大会必将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    苏修分裂行为彻底暴露了它投靠美帝出卖亚非人民团结反帝事业的叛徒嘴脸
    新华社二十四日讯 中国作家协会三月二十四日发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团一手策划的即将在贝鲁特召开的伪“亚非作家第三次大会”，指出这一严重的分裂行为，彻底暴露了苏修公开投靠美帝、公开出卖亚非人民团结反帝事业、公开破坏亚非作家运动的叛徒嘴脸。
    声明表示，将于今年在北京召开的第三次亚非作家大会，必将是更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大会，必将是一个革命的、战斗的、团结的、胜利的大会。作为东道主的中国作家，将为第三次亚非作家大会的胜利召开而贡献自己的最大力量。声明全文如下：
    由苏联修正主义领导集团一手导演的伪“亚非作家第三次大会”的丑剧，即将在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特开场。苏联修正主义者所采取的这一严重的分裂行为，表明他们决心公开与亚非人民和亚非广大的革命、进步作家为敌到底，公开破坏亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结反帝的革命事业。
    中国作家协会完全支持亚非作家常设局三月二十一日关于伪“三大”的声明，坚决谴责和揭露苏联修正主义者这一新的卑鄙阴谋和罪行。
    以森纳那亚克为首的总部设在科伦坡的亚非作家常设局，八年多来，在亚非各国广大革命、进步作家的积极支持下从事了巨大的工作，在许多紧要关头，常设局领导亚非作家举行了一系列规模巨大的战斗集会，特别是去年六月间在北京召开的支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的紧急会议，坚决支持越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争，通过了三十多项支持亚非两大洲各国人民反帝反殖斗争的重大决议，诸如坚定不渝地支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民解放斗争的决议等等。它还出版了多种文字的机关刊物《号召》，发行了亚非文集，翻译和出版了许多反映亚非各国人民斗争的优秀小说、诗歌和其它形式的文学作品；多次派出常设局作家代表团在亚非各国进行访问，促进双边往来，组织文学交流集会，大大加强了亚非各国作家和人民间的相互了解和战斗友谊。通过这一系列卓有成效的活动，为亚非作家运动和亚非人民解放斗争事业，作出了可贵的贡献。
    八年多来，亚非作家运动经历了一条革命的战斗的光荣历程，从头到尾贯穿着两条路线的斗争。中国作家和亚非各国革命的、进步的作家们，始终以亚非作家常设局为中心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，坚定不移地坚持反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，坚决支持亚非人民解放斗争的革命路线，一次又一次地挫败了苏修的种种威逼、利诱、挑唆、破坏的阴谋活动，取得了一个又一个的胜利，把团结反帝的旗帜越举越高。一切忠于亚非人民解放事业的、爱国反帝的革命进步作家，在斗争中越来越坚强了，他们的队伍正在不断壮大，他们的团结正在不断加强。
    与此相反，苏联修正主义者，八年多来恬不知耻地推行一条投靠美帝、出卖亚非人民革命事业、破坏亚非作家运动的投降主义、分裂主义路线。这次，苏修在策划召开伪“三大”的过程中，竟厚颜无耻地向美帝国主义的御用工具联合国教育、科学及文化组织乞讨财经援助，妄图为美帝染指和控制亚非作家运动打开方便之门。他们的卑劣行径，只不过暴露了他们作为美帝国主义头号帮凶的真面目。一些曾经受到迷惑的亚非作家，通过自己的切身体会，觉醒起来，从斗争中认清了敌友，唾弃了苏修，和坚持团结反帝革命路线的亚非作家站在一起，共同战斗。
      “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”当前，亚非两大洲人民的解放斗争，正风起云涌，如火如荼。全世界正在经历着一次大动荡、大分化、大改组。革命力量和反革命力量，阵线日益分明。在这一重大的历史关头，混进亚非作家运动内部的苏联修正主义者，悍然实行公开分裂，这是一件大好事。苏修公开投靠美帝、公开出卖亚非人民团结反帝事业、公开破坏亚非作家运动的行径，只能彻底暴露它的叛徒嘴脸，使亚非人民更加认清它的真面目，最后走上众叛亲离的境地，加速它的灭亡。而亚非作家运动从内部清除了苏修这个分裂主义的根源，必将使自己的队伍更加团结，更加壮大，更加蓬勃发展。
    在发展亚非作家运动的斗争中，中国作家一贯得到亚非广大的革命、进步作家的信任和支持。中国作家遵循着我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，始终把支持亚非各国的革命作家、促进亚非作家运动、支援亚非人民的革命斗争当作自己光荣的国际主义义务。毛主席亲手缔造和领导的中华人民共和国，是亚非革命人民和作家的根据地。毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，正在荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水。伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，正在进一步为七亿中国人民所掌握。经过这场无产阶级文化大革命，作为亚非作家和世界人民革命斗争的根据地的中国，将更加巩固，更加强大。中国作家也将以崭新的革命姿态和阵容，投入亚非作家运动的战斗行列。中国人民和中国作家，必将更好地履行自己的国际主义义务，为亚非作家运动、为亚非人民的团结反帝事业作出更大的贡献。
    一九六六年由五十三个亚非国家和地区的作家代表出席的亚非作家紧急会议，已经庄严宣布：第三次亚非作家大会将于今年在北京召开。这反映了亚非革命人民的共同愿望，反映了亚非革命、进步作家对中国人民的高度信任与支持。作为东道主的中国作家，将为第三次亚非作家大会的胜利召开而贡献自己的最大力量。
    我们坚信第三次亚非作家大会，必将是更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大会，必将是一个革命的、战斗的、团结的、胜利的大会。
    一切革命的、进步的亚非作家团结起来，为挫败苏修一手策划的伪“三大”及其一切阴谋破坏活动，为迎接第三次亚非作家会议的胜利召开而共同奋斗！
