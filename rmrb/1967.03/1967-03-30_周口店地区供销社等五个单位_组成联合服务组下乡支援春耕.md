According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, bank branches, agricultural tool repair factories, and comprehensive repair service stations in the Zhoukoudian area of Beijing's suburbs have recently formed a joint service team under the leadership of the Zhoukoudian People's Commune's frontline command for seizing the revolution and promoting production. They have gone down to the countryside to support spring ploughing, receiving a warm welcome from the broad masses of commune members.

Members of the joint service team, driving a horse-drawn carriage, travel from village to village. On the carriage, which is adorned with a red flag bearing the words "Joint Service Team," there are various agricultural tools such as wooden plows, iron plowshares, hoes, shovels, baskets, shoulder poles, whips, straps, and sprayers, totaling nearly 70 to 80 different items.
