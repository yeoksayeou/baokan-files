Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world!

Today, across the five continents and four seas, in every corner of the world, the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are turned towards Beijing. Hundreds of millions of voices together praise a glorious name: Mao Zedong! Hundreds of millions of people use the most beautiful words to cheer: "Chairman Mao, you are the red sun that never sets in our hearts forever and ever!"

Not long ago, a group of Chinese students studying abroad returned to Beijing from Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Once again, they brought back the deep love and admiration of the people of various countries for our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao. So many people entrusted our students studying abroad to convey their warmest greetings to Chairman Mao when they returned to his side. They said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest leader of humanity. We love Chairman Mao the most. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life, eternal life!"

	We Love Chairman Mao Endlessly

Chinese students studying in Albania are about to leave this heroic country and return home. To express their love for Chairman Mao, whom they miss day and night, they decided to embroider a banner on the land of Albania, which Chairman Mao called "a great socialist beacon in Europe," and bring it back to the motherland to present to the beloved Chairman Mao.

The students' decision somehow reached a local handicraft cooperative's female worker. This worker gave up her holiday and went to the Chinese students' residence to help them embroider the banner. The students were very grateful for her help, but she said: "I am not here to help. I am here to embroider the banner with the boundless love of the Albanian people for Chairman Mao and entrust you to present it to Chairman Mao!"

In Tirana, there is another moving story: One day, a female student from Tirana University obtained a portrait of Chairman Mao from a Chinese comrade. She was overjoyed and immediately had a relative take it home to show her family. She also specially made a long-distance call to ask her father to personally go to the station to welcome it. Her father, who works in a factory, was overjoyed upon receiving the call and rushed to the station to pick up the portrait of Chairman Mao. Just as he was about to hang the portrait on the wall, a few workers happened to see it. The workers gathered around and said: "We love Chairman Mao. To let everyone see Chairman Mao's portrait often, where to hang this portrait of Chairman Mao should be decided by everyone." In the end, everyone decided to hang the portrait in the factory. Chinese students in Tirana were deeply moved when they heard this story.

Chinese students returning from Cuba also brought back the boundless love of the people of Latin America for Chairman Mao. Whenever Chinese students went to a place, many Cuban friends would gather around, hoping to get a badge of Chairman Mao. After obtaining the badge of Chairman Mao, people often jumped for joy, always saying: "I love Chairman Mao the most!"

Once, Chinese students were moving. To protect the portrait of Chairman Mao, they tightly hugged the frame containing the portrait of Chairman Mao to their chests. A Cuban driver saw this and immediately enthusiastically took the portrait of Chairman Mao. He said with deep emotion: "Chairman Mao is not only your leader but also the leader of the revolutionary people of the world!" He then respectfully placed the portrait of Chairman Mao in the driver's cabin. He said: "That's good. I can see Chairman Mao while driving!" One day, a few Chinese students were walking on the road. A truck sped past them, and the workers on the truck saw that the Chinese students had shining badges of Chairman Mao on their chests. They immediately called the driver to stop, but the driver did not hear, so they jumped down from the moving truck, risking danger, and ran to the Chinese students. The Chinese students understood their intentions and gave them the badges of Chairman Mao they were wearing. They immediately raised the badges of Chairman Mao high and then pinned them neatly on their hats. Later, these workers knew that the Chinese students were about to return home, so they came to see them off with tears of excitement. They expressed their love for Chairman Mao to the students and wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

Three African guerrilla fighters who were wounded in the struggle for national liberation are now studying in Cuba. When they saw off the Chinese students, they said: "Mao Zedong Thought has armed us. All our guerrilla fighters yearn for Beijing and miss the great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao. We long for the day when we can go to Beijing. Although we cannot go now, we will definitely have the opportunity to go one day and see the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!" When the Chinese students were about to leave, they warmly held the hands of the Chinese students and took a commemorative photo in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao. Finally, everyone waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and exchanged revolutionary comrades' greetings.

	Revolutionaries Rely on Mao Zedong Thought

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, dew and rain make the crops flourish, revolutionaries rely on Mao Zedong Thought." Today, people of the world in revolutionary struggles deeply feel that: Mao Zedong Thought is like dew, like sunshine, it is the fundamental policy of revolution.

Chinese students abroad often hear friends from various countries enthusiastically praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and eagerly wanting to learn it. They say:

"Chairman Mao is the teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Mao Zedong Thought is the compass of the world's people's revolution, without Mao Zedong Thought there would be no revolution today."

"Mao Zedong Thought is full of human wisdom and power, it is a further development of Marxism-Leninism, it is not only applicable to China but also to the whole world."

"We revolutionary people's relationship with Mao Zedong Thought is like fish and water, fish cannot live without water, revolutionaries cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought."

Last year, after the publication of the "Communiqu√© of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," a Cuban gardener excitedly told our students: "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the people of the world. The great victories achieved by your party and country are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought." A Cuban nurse proudly told our students: "Chairman Mao is the person we admire the most in our hearts. We must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought and become revolutionary fighters loyal to Mao Zedong Thought."

What deeply moved the Chinese students was that friends from various countries, in order to master Mao Zedong Thought, all hoped to obtain Chairman Mao's works. Friends from various countries unanimously said: "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary treasures!" "Chairman Mao's books are our most precious spiritual food!" Some friends, after obtaining Chairman Mao's works, were overjoyed, some shouted: "The treasure book has finally been found!" Some held the book in their hands, pressed it to their chests, and kissed it repeatedly; some raised it high above their heads and enthusiastically cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Before leaving Cuba, Chinese students gave some single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works to a Cuban classmate. That classmate, after receiving the treasure book, excitedly said: "Chinese comrades really understand me. You have brought me the book we need most. I will definitely study hard in the future and actively propagate it, so that people all over the country can hear Chairman Mao's voice." A Guyanese student studying in Cuba, after obtaining a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," swore: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, I will study them every day and read them every day. I will definitely use it as a weapon, as Comrade Lin Biao instructed." Some Bolivian students in Cuba also voluntarily formed a study group for Chairman Mao's works, studying together twice a week and discussing and researching together. Some foreign friends also enthusiastically invited Chinese students to study with them and jointly master Mao Zedong Thought.

In Algeria, there is a Palestinian student who had participated in the anti-French war in Algeria and had a deep affection for Chairman Mao's works. He said: "During the anti-French war, many soldiers had a few small booklets by Chairman Mao on strategy, tactics, and Chinese revolutionary experience. We armed ourselves with Chairman Mao's books and used Chairman Mao's books as weapons, finally defeating the French imperialists. Today, the Palestinian people, as long as they follow Chairman Mao's teachings and persist in armed struggle, will definitely be able to defeat the colonialists and achieve victory in the war of national liberation."

	Follow Chairman Mao Forever and Revolution

"Dear Chinese comrades, please tell the Chinese people that China is our example, it is our direction of advancement! In the hearts of the Algerian people, only China is our ideal, we Algerian people must advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!" This is a passionate conversation between two Algerian farmers and Chinese students who are about to return home. These few short sentences express people's admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and their longing for New China.

Abroad, our students often hear such praise: China is the center of the world revolution; only China led by Chairman Mao is the great example of the people of the world! An African friend said: "We have already understood that the current leadership of the Soviet Union has become modern revisionists and has become a lackey of imperialism. China is the true socialist country. We hope that China will always be revolutionary and become a beacon of the world revolution."

In 1966, our country held an exhibition in Algeria. Many people enthusiastically came to visit and left moving messages. A teacher wrote: "Your Chinese pavilion is like a red lamp, inspiring my courage and that of the Algerian people, and filling us with hope for the revolution." In the exhibition hall, there is a large painting depicting the thriving situation of New China. After seeing this painting, a visitor happily told the guide: "I saw the revolutionary road that the Chinese people have walked under the leadership of Chairman Mao from this painting. This is a brilliant road, we must also walk this road of victory."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is unprecedented and shakes the world. The people of the world, through this great revolutionary movement, once again clearly saw the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. An African friend said well: "Every victory China achieves is due to the great Mao Zedong Thought, due to the great leader Chairman Mao. We must follow Chairman Mao and revolution forever!"

Chairman Mao, the people of the world look up to you! The people of the world follow you! The people of the world sing in unison: "Chairman Mao is the red sun that illuminates the revolutionary road of the world!"
