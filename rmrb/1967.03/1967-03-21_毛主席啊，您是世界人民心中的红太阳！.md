Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world!

Today, across the five continents and four seas, in every corner of the world, the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are turned towards Beijing. Hundreds of millions of voices together praise a glorious name: Mao Zedong! Hundreds of millions of people use the most beautiful words to cheer: "Chairman Mao, you are the red sun that never sets in our hearts forever and ever!"

Not long ago, a group of Chinese students studying abroad returned to Beijing from Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Once again, they brought back the deep love and admiration of the people of various countries for our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao. So many people entrusted our students studying abroad to convey their warmest greetings to Chairman Mao when they returned to his side. They said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest leader of humanity. We love Chairman Mao the most. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life, eternal life!"

	We Love Chairman Mao Endlessly

Chinese students studying in Albania are about to leave this heroic country and return home. To express their love for Chairman Mao, whom they miss day and night, they decided to embroider a banner on the land of Albania, which Chairman Mao called "a great socialist beacon in Europe," and bring it back to the motherland to present to the beloved Chairman Mao.

The students' decision somehow reached a local handicraft cooperative's female worker. This worker gave up her holiday and went to the Chinese students' residence to help them embroider the banner. The students were very grateful for her help, but she said: "I am not here to help. I am here to embroider the banner with the boundless love of the Albanian people for Chairman Mao and entrust you to present it to Chairman Mao!"

In Tirana, there is another moving story: One day, a female student from Tirana University obtained a portrait of Chairman Mao from a Chinese comrade. She was overjoyed and immediately had a relative take it home to show her family. She also specially made a long-distance call to ask her father to personally go to the station to welcome it. Her father, who works in a factory, was overjoyed upon receiving the call and rushed to the station to pick up the portrait of Chairman Mao. Just as he was about to hang the portrait on the wall, a few workers happened to see it. The workers gathered around and said: "We love Chairman Mao. To let everyone see Chairman Mao's portrait often, where to hang this portrait of Chairman Mao should be decided by everyone." In the end, everyone decided to hang the portrait in the factory. Chinese students in Tirana were deeply moved when they heard this story.

Chinese students returning from Cuba also brought back the boundless love of the people of Latin America for Chairman Mao. Whenever Chinese students went to a place, many Cuban friends would gather around, hoping to get a badge of Chairman Mao. After obtaining the badge of Chairman Mao, people often jumped for joy, always saying: "I love Chairman Mao the most!"

Once, Chinese students were moving. To protect the portrait of Chairman Mao, they tightly hugged the frame containing the portrait of Chairman Mao to their chests. A Cuban driver saw this and immediately enthusiastically took the portrait of Chairman Mao. He said with deep emotion: "Chairman Mao is not only your leader but also the leader of the revolutionary people of the world!" He then respectfully placed the portrait of Chairman Mao in the driver's cabin. He said: "That's good. I can see Chairman Mao while driving!" One day, a few Chinese students were walking on the road. A truck sped past them, and the workers on the truck saw that the Chinese students had shining badges of Chairman Mao on their chests. They immediately called the driver to stop, but the driver did not hear, so they jumped down from the moving truck, risking danger, and ran to the Chinese students. The Chinese students understood their intentions and gave them the badges of Chairman Mao they were wearing. They immediately raised the badges of Chairman Mao high and then pinned them neatly on their hats. Later, these workers knew that the Chinese students were about to return home, so they came to see them off with tears of excitement. They expressed their love for Chairman Mao to the students and wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

Three African guerrilla fighters who were wounded in the struggle for national liberation are now studying in Cuba. When they saw off the Chinese students, they said: "Mao Zedong Thought has armed us. All our guerrilla fighters yearn for Beijing and miss the great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao. We long for the day when we can go to Beijing. Although we cannot go now, we will definitely have the opportunity to go one day and see the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!" When the Chinese students were about to leave, they warmly held the hands of the Chinese students and took a commemorative photo in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao. Finally, everyone waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and exchanged revolutionary comrades' greetings.

	Revolutionaries Rely on Mao Zedong Thought

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, dew and rain make the crops flourish, revolutionaries rely on Mao Zedong Thought." Today, people of the world in revolutionary struggles deeply feel that: Mao Zedong Thought is like dew, like sunshine, it is the fundamental policy of revolution.

Chinese students abroad often hear friends from various countries enthusiastically praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and eagerly wanting to learn it. They say:

"Chairman Mao is the teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Mao Zedong Thought is the compass of the world's people's revolution, without Mao Zedong Thought there would be no revolution today."

"Mao Zedong Thought is full of human wisdom and power, it is a further development of Marxism-Leninism, it is not only applicable to China but also to the whole world."

"We revolutionary people's relationship with Mao Zedong Thought is like fish and water, fish cannot live without water, revolutionaries cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought."

Last year, after the publication of the "Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," a Cuban gardener excitedly told our students: "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the people of the world. The great victories achieved by your party and country are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought." A Cuban nurse proudly told our students: "Chairman Mao is the person we admire the most in our hearts. We must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought and become revolutionary fighters loyal to Mao Zedong Thought."

What deeply moved the Chinese students was that friends from various countries, in order to master Mao Zedong Thought, all hoped to obtain Chairman Mao's works. Friends from various countries unanimously said: "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary treasures!" "Chairman Mao's books are our most precious spiritual food!" Some friends, after obtaining Chairman Mao's works, were overjoyed, some shouted: "The treasure book has finally been found!" Some held the book in their hands, pressed it to their chests, and kissed it repeatedly; some raised it high above their heads and enthusiastically cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Before leaving Cuba, Chinese students gave some single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works to a Cuban classmate. That classmate, after receiving the treasure book, excitedly said: "Chinese comrades really understand me. You have brought me the book we need most. I will definitely study hard in the future and actively propagate it, so that people all over the country can hear Chairman Mao's voice." A Guyanese student studying in Cuba, after obtaining a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," swore: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, I will study them every day and read them every day. I will definitely use it as a weapon, as Comrade Lin Biao instructed." Some Bolivian students in Cuba also voluntarily formed a study group for Chairman Mao's works, studying together twice a week and discussing and researching together. Some foreign friends also enthusiastically invited Chinese students to study with them and jointly master Mao Zedong Thought.

In Algeria, there is a Palestinian student who had participated in the anti-French war in Algeria and had a deep affection for Chairman Mao's works. He said: "During the anti-French war, many soldiers had a few small booklets by Chairman Mao on strategy, tactics, and Chinese revolutionary experience. We armed ourselves with Chairman Mao's books and used Chairman Mao's books as weapons, finally defeating the French imperialists. Today, the Palestinian people, as long as they follow Chairman Mao's teachings and persist in armed struggle, will definitely be able to defeat the colonialists and achieve victory in the war of national liberation."

	Follow Chairman Mao Forever and Revolution

"Dear Chinese comrades, please tell the Chinese people that China is our example, it is our direction of advancement! In the hearts of the Algerian people, only China is our ideal, we Algerian people must advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!" This is a passionate conversation between two Algerian farmers and Chinese students who are about to return home. These few short sentences express people's admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and their longing for New China.

Abroad, our students often hear such praise: China is the center of the world revolution; only China led by Chairman Mao is the great example of the people of the world! An African friend said: "We have already understood that the current leadership of the Soviet Union has become modern revisionists and has become a lackey of imperialism. China is the true socialist country. We hope that China will always be revolutionary and become a beacon of the world revolution."

In 1966, our country held an exhibition in Algeria. Many people enthusiastically came to visit and left moving messages. A teacher wrote: "Your Chinese pavilion is like a red lamp, inspiring my courage and that of the Algerian people, and filling us with hope for the revolution." In the exhibition hall, there is a large painting depicting the thriving situation of New China. After seeing this painting, a visitor happily told the guide: "I saw the revolutionary road that the Chinese people have walked under the leadership of Chairman Mao from this painting. This is a brilliant road, we must also walk this road of victory."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is unprecedented and shakes the world. The people of the world, through this great revolutionary movement, once again clearly saw the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. An African friend said well: "Every victory China achieves is due to the great Mao Zedong Thought, due to the great leader Chairman Mao. We must follow Chairman Mao and revolution forever!"

Chairman Mao, the people of the world look up to you! The people of the world follow you! The people of the world sing in unison: "Chairman Mao is the red sun that illuminates the revolutionary road of the world!"

    毛主席啊，您是世界人民心中的红太阳！
    今天，在五洲四海，在全世界的每一个角落，亿万革命人民的心向着北京，亿万人同声称颂着一个光辉的名字：毛泽东！亿万人用一句最美好的语言欢呼：“毛主席啊，我们心中永远永远不落的红太阳！”
    不久前，我国的一批留学生，从非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲回到北京，又一次带回了世界各国人民对我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰的崇高感情。多少人嘱托我国留学生在回到毛主席身边的时候，一定记着代他们向毛主席致最亲切的问候。他们说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是人类最伟大的领袖，我们最热爱毛主席，我们祝愿毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
        我们无限热爱毛主席
    在阿尔巴尼亚学习的我国留学生，就要离开这个英雄的国度回国了。他们为了表达对自己日夜想念的毛主席的热爱，决定在被毛主席称为“欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”——阿尔巴尼亚的土地上，绣一面锦旗，带回祖国去，献给敬爱的毛主席。
    留学生们的这个决定，不知怎么让当地一位手工业合作社的女工知道了，这位女工竟放弃了假日，来到中国留学生住处，和同学们一起飞针走线，绣起旗来。同学们十分感谢这位女同志的帮助，而她却说：“我不是来帮忙的，我是要把阿尔巴尼亚人民对毛主席无限热爱的情意，绣在锦旗上，托你们送给毛主席！”
    在地拉那还有这样一个激动人心的故事：一天，地拉那大学的一位女学生从中国同志处得到一幅毛主席像片，她高兴极了，立即托同乡带回家里，让自己的亲人看看毛主席像。她还特地挂了长途电话，请她父亲亲自到车站迎接。她父亲在工厂工作，接到电话后，喜得心花怒放，忙到车站把毛主席像接到家里。正准备要把毛主席像挂在壁上，恰好被几个工人发现了，工人们围拢上来说：“我们热爱毛主席，为了能让大家都常常看到毛主席像，这张毛主席像挂在什么地方好，要由大家商量。”结果大家决定把毛主席像挂到了工厂里。在地拉那的我国留学生听到这个故事后，都深深受到感动。
        祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    从古巴回来的我国留学生，也带回了拉丁美洲人民对毛主席的无限热爱。中国留学生每到一处，总有好多古巴朋友围上来，希望得到毛主席像章。人们得到毛主席像章后，常常高兴得跳了起来，他们总是说：“我最热爱毛主席！”
    有一次，我国留学生搬家。同学们为了保护毛主席像，就把装着毛主席像的镜框紧紧抱在怀里。一位古巴司机看到后，立即热情地把毛主席像接过去，他满怀深情地说：“毛主席不仅是你们的领袖，也是世界革命人民的领袖呀！”于是，他恭恭敬敬地把毛主席像放在驾驶室内。他说：“这就好了，我开车时，就可以看到毛主席了！”一天，几名我国留学生在路上走着，一辆卡车从他们身边飞驰而过，坐在车上的工人看见这几名中国留学生的胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，就忙叫司机停车，司机没听到，他们就不顾危险，从行驶的汽车上跳了下来，跑到我国留学生跟前。我国留学生领会他们的来意，便把自己戴的毛主席像章送给了他们。他们立即把毛主席像章高举起来，然后端端正正地别在帽子上。后来这几位工人知道中国留学生要回国，他们便噙着激动的泪水前来送别。他们向留学生表达了对毛主席的热爱心情，祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    有三位曾在民族解放斗争中光荣负伤的非洲游击队员，现在古巴学习。他们在为我国留学生送行时说：“毛泽东思想武装了我们，我们所有的游击队员都向往北京，都想念伟大的革命导师毛主席。我们日夜盼着去北京。虽然我们现在没有机会去，可是我们总有一天有机会去的，总有一天能够见到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！”我国留学生动身回国时，他们亲热地拉着中国留学生的手，在毛主席像前合影留念。最后大家挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，互致革命战友的敬意。
    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想
      “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。”今天，全世界人民在革命斗争实践中，深深体会到：毛泽东思想就象雨露，就象阳光，就是革命的根本方针。
    我国留学生在国外，常常听到各国朋友热情赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想，渴望学习毛泽东思想。他们说：
    “毛主席是世界革命人民的导师，毛泽东思想是世界人民革命的指南针，没有毛泽东思想就没有今天的革命。”
    “毛泽东思想充满了人类的智慧和力量，是对马克思列宁主义的进一步发展，它不仅适用于中国，而且适用于全世界。”
    “我们革命人民与毛泽东思想的关系，就是鱼水关系，鱼离开了水不行，革命者离开了毛泽东思想就不行。”
    去年，《中国共产党八届十一中全会公报》发表后，一位古巴园艺工人激动地对我留学生说：“毛主席是世界人民最伟大的领袖。你们党和国家所取得的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”一位古巴护士自豪地对我留学生说：“毛泽东主席是我们心中最敬佩的人，我们一定要努力学习毛泽东思想，做一名忠实于毛泽东思想的革命战士。”
    使我国留学生深受感动的是，各国朋友为了掌握毛泽东思想，都热望得到毛主席著作。各国朋友异口同声地说：“毛主席的书是革命的宝书！”“毛主席的书是我们最宝贵的精神食粮！”一些朋友在得到毛主席著作后高兴万分，有的喊道：“宝书终于找到了！”有的把书拿在手里，捧在胸前，贴在脸上，亲切地吻了又吻；有的高举到头顶上，热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    我国留学生离开古巴前，把一些毛主席著作单行本送给一位古巴同学，那位同学接过宝书激动地说：“中国同志真了解我，你们给我送来了我们最迫切需要的书。我今后一定要努力学习，积极宣传，让全国人民都能听到毛主席的声音。”一位在古巴学习的圭亚那学生得到一本《毛主席语录》后宣誓说：“毛主席的话，句句是真理，我要天天学，天天读。我一定要象林彪同志教导的那样，象使用武器一样去使用它。”在古巴的一些玻利维亚学生，还自动组成了毛主席著作学习小组，每周集体学习两次，互相研究讨论。有的外国朋友还热情地邀请中国留学生同他们一起学习，共同掌握毛泽东思想。
    在阿尔及利亚，有一个巴勒斯坦的留学生，这个学生曾经在阿尔及利亚参加过抗法战争，对毛主席著作很有感情。他说：“在抗法战争时期，许多官兵都有几本毛主席关于战略战术和中国革命经验的小册子。我们用毛主席的书武装自己，把毛主席的书当作武器，终于打败了法帝国主义者。今天，巴勒斯坦人民只要按照毛主席的教导，坚持武装斗争，就一定能够打倒殖民主义者，取得民族解放战争的胜利。”
      紧跟毛主席　永远干革命
    “亲爱的中国同志，请告诉中国人民，你们中国是我们的榜样，是我们前进的方向！在阿尔及利亚人民心眼里，只有中国才是我们的理想，我们阿尔及利亚人民一定要沿着毛主席指引的方向前进！”这是两位阿尔及利亚农民，对即将回国的我国留学生一席热情洋溢的谈话。这短短的几句话，表达了人们对伟大领袖毛主席的爱戴，表达了他们对新中国的向往。
    在国外，我们的留学生常常可以听到这样的赞语：中国，是世界革命的中心；只有毛主席领导的中国，才是世界人民伟大的榜样！一位非洲朋友说：“我们已经明白了，苏联现在的领导已变成了现代修正主义者，成了帝国主义的走卒。中国才是真正的社会主义国家，我们希望中国永远革命，成为世界革命的灯塔。”
    一九六六年，我国在阿尔及利亚举办了一个展览会。许多群众踊跃来参观，并且写下了激动人心的留言。一位教师写道：“你们中国馆好象一盏红灯，鼓舞了我和阿尔及利亚人民的勇气，对革命充满了希望。”在展览馆里挂着一幅很大的表现新中国气象万千的画，一位参观者看了这幅画以后高兴地对讲解员说：“我从这幅画上看到了中国人民在毛主席领导下走过的革命道路，这是一条光辉灿烂的大道，我们也一定要走这条胜利的道路。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，史无前例，震撼全球。全世界人民从这一伟大的革命运动中，又一次清楚地看到了毛泽东思想的伟大光辉。一位非洲朋友说得好：“中国取得每一个胜利，都归功于伟大的毛泽东思想，归功于伟大领袖毛主席。我们要紧跟毛主席，永远干革命！”
    毛主席啊，全世界人民仰望着您！全世界人民跟着您！全世界人民齐声唱：“毛主席是照亮世界革命道路的红太阳！”　·新华社记者·
