	Revolutionary comrades, dear fellow fighters:

	Today, we, the revolutionary masses of Shandong, are gathering here to celebrate the establishment of our provincial revolutionary committee and to celebrate the great victory of our province's revolutionary "three-in-one" combined seizure of power!

	First of all, let us together wish our greatest and most beloved leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Let us wish our deputy commander, Comrade Lin Biao, eternal health!

	"Tigers and dragons now surpass the past, the earth and heavens have changed dramatically." The revolutionary masses of Shandong, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have risen up with mighty strength, repelling the enemy's repeated frenzied counterattacks, and have seized all the power over party, government, finance, and culture from the hands of a small clique of capitalism-roaders within the former provincial party committee and provincial people's committee. We have completely smashed their bourgeois headquarters. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

	In this great struggle, our great leader Chairman Mao has given us, the revolutionary masses, the greatest encouragement, the greatest support, and the greatest care. We shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

	In this great struggle, the revolutionary workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and cadres of Shandong have shown a heroic and tenacious fighting spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. We shout: Long live the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!

	In this great struggle, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong has firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary left of the proletariat and has made outstanding contributions to the seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We must resolutely learn from the PLA! We salute the PLA! Long live the great People's Liberation Army of China!

	For many years, a small clique of capitalism-roaders within the Shandong provincial party committee and provincial people's committee have fiercely opposed our great leader Chairman Mao and stubbornly pursued a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They opposed emphasizing politics, opposed Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, advocated class reconciliation, and promoted material incentives. In the early 1960s, they spread the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract"; during the "Four Clean-ups" movement in 1964, they vigorously promoted a reactionary line that was "left" in form but right in essence; since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have stubbornly pursued a bourgeois reactionary line, resisted the Sixteen Points, resisted Chairman Mao's instructions, created a white terror, suppressed the revolutionary mass movement, and committed heinous crimes.

	The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. The power of the small clique of capitalism-roaders within the former Shandong provincial party committee and provincial people's committee must be seized. If we do not seize it, we cannot implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; if we do not seize it, we cannot uproot the roots of revisionism and capitalism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat; if we do not seize it, we cannot carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Today, we, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have seized this power back. This power has been seized correctly! Seized well! Seized justly!

	In the struggle to seize power, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong have strictly followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, achieved an unprecedented great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and formed a powerful "three-in-one" leadership core; relying on the full support of the stationed troops, we have resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionaries and thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary plots of the class enemies; within the revolutionary ranks, we have carried out rectification while fighting, armed our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and ensured the unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in thought and action.

	Chairman Mao is our supreme commander. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do. All the victories achieved by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong are ultimately derived from the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must be vigilant and avoid arrogance. We must press on and advance.

	We must carry the struggle to seize power to the end. In all regions and units where the power has been usurped by the capitalism-roaders within the party, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat must, on the basis of great unity and "three-in-one" combination, seize back all the power over party, government, finance, and culture that they have held; in regions and units where power has already been seized, we must rely on the revolutionary left, unite the majority of the masses, strengthen and consolidate the "three-in-one" leadership core, establish a new revolutionary order, and thoroughly complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	In the struggle to seize power, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat must seriously implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and correctly handle cadres. All revolutionary cadres must resolutely and swiftly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and unite with the broad revolutionary masses to fight shoulder to shoulder.

	We must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Counter-revolutionary organizations must be disbanded, and counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed. We must make the enemy behave and not allow them to cause trouble.

	We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We must put revolution in the first place, use revolution to guide production, carry out revolution on a large scale, promote production on a large scale, be both revolutionary pioneers and production models, and strive for victory in both revolution and production.

	We must diligently and earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out rectification while fighting, break down the "private" self in the process of transforming the objective world, establish the "public" self, and through criticism and self-criticism, overcome some non-proletarian ideological consciousness that exists at present, raise class consciousness, and strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline.

	Revolutionary comrades: Let us follow Chairman Mao's teachings, proceed in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance bravely! Victory will surely belong to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!

	Finally, let us shout:

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live the victory of the combined seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!

	Long live the great Communist Party of China!

	Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    依靠革命左派团结群众大多数
    争取“三结合”联合夺权彻底胜利
    王效禹同志在庆祝山东省革命委员会成立大会上的讲话
    新华社济南三日电　参加山东省夺权斗争的革命领导干部、前青岛市副市长王效禹同志在热烈庆祝山东省革命委员会成立大会上的讲话，全文如下：革命的同志们，亲爱的战友们：
    今天我们山东的无产阶级革命派在这里隆重集会，热烈庆祝我省革命委员会的成立，热烈庆祝我省革命的“三结合”联合夺权的伟大胜利！
    首先让我们共同祝愿我们最最伟大的领袖，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！祝愿我们的副统帅林彪同志身体永远健康！
      “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”我们山东的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋起千钧棒，打退了敌人一次又一次的疯狂反扑，从前省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手中，夺回了党、政、财、文一切大权，彻底摧垮了他们这个资产阶级司令部。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    在这场伟大的斗争中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席给了我们无产阶级革命派以最大的鼓舞、最大的支持、最大的关怀，我们高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
    在这场伟大的斗争中，我们山东的革命工人、革命农民、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，表现了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英勇顽强的战斗精神，我们高呼：无产阶级革命群众万岁！
    在这场伟大的斗争中，中国人民解放军驻山东地区部队坚定地站在无产阶级革命左派一边，为无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争作出了杰出贡献，我们要坚决向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    多年以来，山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，拚命地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，顽固地推行了一条反革命的修正主义路线。他们反对突出政治，反对毛泽东思想挂帅，鼓吹阶级调和，大搞物质刺激。一九六○年前后，大刮“三自一包”的阴风；一九六四年“四清”运动中，极力推行形“左”实右的反动路线；无产阶级文化大革命以来，又顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，抗拒十六条，抗拒毛主席的指示，制造白色恐怖，镇压革命的群众运动，犯下了滔天罪行。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。前山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权非夺不可。不夺，就不能贯彻毛主席的革命路线；不夺，就不能挖掉修正主义、资本主义的根子，巩固无产阶级专政；不夺，就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。今天，我们无产阶级革命派把这个权夺回来了，这个权夺得对！夺得好！夺得有理！
    在夺权斗争中，我们山东的无产阶级革命派紧紧遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了空前未有的大联合，实现了革命的“三结合”，组成了一个强有力的“三结合”的领导核心；依靠驻军部队的全力支持，坚决镇压反革命，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的反夺权的阴谋；在革命派内部，边战斗，边整风，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，保证了无产阶级革命派在思想上和行动上的一致。
    毛主席是我们的最高统帅。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。我们山东的无产阶级革命派所取得的一切胜利，归根结底，都是来源于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们无产阶级革命派一定要戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进。
    我们一定要把夺权斗争进行到底。凡是被党内走资本主义道路的当权派窃踞领导权的地区和单位，无产阶级革命派必须在大联合、“三结合”的基础上，把他们把持的党、政、财、文一切大权统统夺回来；已经夺权的地区和单位，一定要依靠革命左派，团结群众大多数，充实和巩固“三结合”的领导核心，建立革命的新秩序，彻底完成斗、批、改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在夺权斗争中，无产阶级革命派要认真执行毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部。一切革命的干部都应该坚决地、迅速地站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来，与广大的革命群众团结在一起，并肩战斗。
    我们一定要加强无产阶级专政。反革命组织一定要取缔，反革命分子一定要镇压，只准敌人老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动。
    我们一定要坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把革命放在第一位，用革命统帅生产，大抓革命，大促生产，既做革命的闯将，又做生产的模范，争取革命、生产双胜利。
    我们一定要刻苦地、认真地活学活用毛主席著作，一边战斗，一边整风，在改造客观世界的同时，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，改造自己的主观世界，通过批评和自我批评，克服当前存在着的一些非无产阶级的思想意识，提高阶级觉悟，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    革命的同志们：让我们紧跟毛主席的教导，沿着毛主席指引的方向，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进！胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派！
    最后，让我们高呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    无产阶级革命派联合夺权胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
