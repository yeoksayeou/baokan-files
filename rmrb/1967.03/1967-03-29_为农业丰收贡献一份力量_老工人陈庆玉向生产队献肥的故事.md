One day, representatives from the seventh production brigade of Dongsheng Brigade, Lizheng Commune, in the suburbs of Changchun City, came to the home of veteran worker Chen Qingyu. They brought drums and gongs, held high a portrait of Chairman Mao, and carried with them a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and a bound volume of the "Three Articles." They came to present these items to Chen Qingyu.

This is a story of revolutionary friendship between workers and peasants.

Chen Qingyu is an old worker from the Supply Department of the Construction Section at the First Automobile Works in Changchun. Last year, he underwent a major surgery due to illness and was recuperating at home. In the past, he had always been diligent and responsible in his work. Now, unable to work due to illness, how could he just sit idle? He recalled Chairman Mao's teachings on the spirit of Dr. Norman Bethune, who had no selfish motives: "A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is already noble-minded and pure, an honest man, a man of moral integrity, a man who is free from the petty desire to strive for personal fame and gain, a man who has made up his mind to serve his people whole-heartedly." He said, "I am a worker and must follow Chairman Mao's instructions. If I cannot work in the factory, I will collect some manure to support agricultural production." From then on, he carried a small bucket and went out every day, collecting manure wherever he found it. By mid-February this year, he had collected over nine thousand pounds. He decided to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" by donating this manure to the production brigade.

Coincidentally, members of the seventh production brigade of Dongsheng Brigade were in the city to buy manure and found Chen Qingyu's home. As soon as the brigade member stated his purpose, Chen Qingyu led him to the back of the house, pointing to a large pile of manure and said, "Take it all." The brigade member saw that there were no ice blocks or soil, only high-quality human and animal manure, and was very pleased. He repeatedly asked about the price. Chen Qingyu waved his hand and said, "No charge, take it all." But the brigade member thought, "So much manure, how can we take it for free?" He repeatedly persuaded Chen Qingyu, but Chen Qingyu insisted on not taking any money. He said, "Chairman Mao calls on us to support agriculture. I donate this manure to the production brigade as a token of my support for agriculture. The production brigade is like my home, and I am a member of the production brigade. It is only right for a member to contribute manure and effort to his own production brigade!"

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the production brigade heard about this and said, "This old worker loves the collective so much; it is the result of being armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong. We should learn from him, study Chairman Mao's works actively, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We should grasp the revolution and promote production, striving for victory in both revolution and production."

After discussing, the entire brigade of poor and lower-middle peasants decided to present Chen Qingyu with a set of Chairman Mao's "Selected Works" to express their desire to study Chairman Mao's works together with this old worker, and to advance side by side under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    为农业丰收贡献一份力量
    老工人陈庆玉向生产队献肥的故事
    一天，长春市郊区立新公社东升大队第七生产队的代表，敲锣打鼓，高举毛主席像，带着一部《毛泽东选集》、一本《毛主席语录》和一本“老三篇”的合订本，送到老工人陈庆玉家里。
    这里有一段工农之间的革命友谊的故事。
    陈庆玉是长春第一汽车制造厂供应处基建科的老工人。去年因病动了大手术，在家休养。他过去在工作中兢兢业业，认真负责。这次有病不能到厂干活，怎么能闲得住呢？他想起了毛主席学习白求恩同志毫无自私自利之心的精神的教导：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”他说：“我是工人，一定要听毛主席的话。不能到工厂干活，就拣点粪支援农业生产。”从此，他天天带个小桶到处散步，遇粪就拣，到今年二月中旬，已经拣了九千多斤。他决心响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把这些粪献给生产队。
    可巧，东升大队第七生产队的社员进城买粪，找到了陈庆玉家。社员刚说明来意，陈庆玉就把他领到房后，指着一大堆粪说：你们拉去吧。这位社员一看，没有冰块，没有土，尽是优质的人粪和畜粪，着实喜欢，连连打听价钱。陈庆玉摆摆手说：不要钱，你们都拉走吧。但这位社员想，这么多粪，怎能白要呢？他一再说服陈庆玉，陈庆玉却百般不肯要钱。他说：毛主席号召我们支援农业，我就把这点粪献给生产队，作为我支援农业的一点心意。生产队就是我的家，我就是生产队的社员。社员为自己生产队献点粪，尽点力是应该的！
    生产队的贫下中农听到这件事，都说：这位老工人这样热爱集体，是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果。咱们要向他学习，象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，按毛主席的指示办事，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取革命、生产双胜利。
    全队的贫下中农经过商量，决定赠给陈庆玉一套宝书《毛泽东选集》，表示要和这位老工人一起，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，并肩前进。（新华社）
