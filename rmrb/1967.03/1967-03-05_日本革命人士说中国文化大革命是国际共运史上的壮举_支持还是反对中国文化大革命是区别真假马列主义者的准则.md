According to Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo, the local *East Wind* newspaper recently published a letter written by former *Red Flag* newspaper correspondent in Berlin, Kanazawa Yukio, along with Kanazawa Hamako, Saito Ryuta, Tanaka Haruyo, Oka Harumi, and Kaji Tami, to workers in Shanghai during their visit to China. The letter enthusiastically congratulated the great progress of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought, praising Mao Zedong Thought as the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in history.

The letter pointed out that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has taken a new step in human history. The great revolution carried out by the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is an immense contribution to the world revolution, with a tremendous international impact.

The letter stated: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution carried out by the Chinese people is directly related to the support for the Vietnamese people's great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Moreover, it is a great cause related to the fate of revolutionary people around the world, including the Japanese people, and is a great feat in the history of international communism."

The letter pointed out: "Currently, the heads of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding to oppose the world's revolutionary people. The heads of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are openly conspiring to oppose China. The U.S. imperialists, the revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU, their old and new followers, and the reactionaries of various countries all hate this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution due to their class nature."

The letter further stated: "On the contrary, those who truly fight against U.S. imperialism all show class solidarity with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Those who truly oppose the revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU and their old and new followers all show class solidarity with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Those who truly fight against the reactionaries of various countries all show class solidarity with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a trend that conforms to the laws of contemporary revolution, a trend that no one can stop."

Kanazawa Yukio and others expressed in the letter: "We, the Japanese revolutionary faction visiting China, firmly believe that for all revolutionaries, it is a matter of distinguishing between revolution and counter-revolution whether to firmly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought or to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. There is no middle ground."

"The question of whether all revolutionaries learn the true mass line and revolutionary spirit from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, or oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the strict criterion for distinguishing true from false Marxists-Leninists. There is no middle ground."

The letter said, "We also want to use your revolutionary flames to transform ourselves."

    日本革命人士说中国文化大革命是国际共运史上的壮举
    支持还是反对中国文化大革命是区别真假马列主义者的准则
    据新华社东京电　这里的《东风》报不久前刊登了《赤旗报》前驻柏林记者金泽幸雄以及金泽浜子、斋藤龙太、田中春阳、冈春美和梶田美穗子，在访问中国期间写给上海工人的一封信，热烈地祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大进展和毛泽东思想的新胜利，赞扬毛泽东思想是历史上最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    信中指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，在人类历史上迈出了新的一步。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民所进行的这场大革命，对世界革命是无比的贡献，有着巨大的国际影响。
    这封信指出：“中国人民进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命，是同中国人民对越南人民的伟大的抗美救国斗争的支援直接相关的。而且这是关系到包括日本人民在内的全世界革命人民的命运的伟大事业，是国际共产主义运动史上的壮举。”
    这封信指出：“目前，美苏头子正在狼狈为奸反对世界革命人民，美苏头子正在串通一气明目张胆地反对中国。”“美帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的修正主义者及其新旧追随者和各国反动派，出于他们的阶级本性，都憎恨这场无产阶级文化大革命。”
    这封信接着指出：“与此相反，真正同美帝国主义斗争的人们，都对无产阶级文化大革命表现了阶级同情。真正反对以苏共领导为中心的修正主义者及其新旧追随者的人们，都对无产阶级文化大革命表现了阶级同情。真正同各国反动派斗争的人们，都对无产阶级文化大革命表现了阶级同情。这是一股符合当代革命规律的潮流，是任何人也无法阻挡的。”
    金泽幸雄等在信中表示：“我们正在访问中国的日本革命派确信：对所有的革命派说来，坚决支持以毛泽东思想为指导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，还是反对毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命，这是区别革命与反革命的准则，此外是不可能有中间道路的。”
    “对于所有的革命派来说，是从中国的无产阶级文化大革命中学习真正的群众路线和革命灵魂，还是反对无产阶级文化大革命，这是严格区别真假马克思列宁主义者的准则，此外，是不可能有中间道路的。”
    信中说，我们也要用您们燃烧起来的革命烈火来改造自己。
