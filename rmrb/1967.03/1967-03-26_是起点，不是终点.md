The storm of the "January Revolution" that began in Shanghai has swept across the country. In some places and some departments, the fortresses occupied by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have been one by one captured and seized by the revolutionary army of the proletariat. The proletarian revolutionary masses have achieved great victories in their struggle for power. However, the struggle for power and counter-revolutionary power seizures continues, and in some places, there are signs of a capitalist restoration.

Currently, a major issue facing the revolutionary soldiers of the proletariat is: what should be done after achieving victory in the struggle for power?

Many readers have written to the newspaper with excellent opinions on this issue. Below are four selected pieces, summarized and published as follows.

	It is a Starting Point, Not an Endpoint

	In a bourgeois revolution, once the political power is seized, the ultimate goal is achieved. However, for the proletarian revolutionary forces, after seizing power, there is still a vast and arduous task of transforming people and society ahead.

	In a bourgeois revolution, once the political power is seized, everything is settled, and one can rely on the seized power to plunder the people and enrich oneself. However, for us proletarian revolutionaries, after achieving victory in the struggle for power, there is still a more extensive, more arduous, and more detailed task of transforming people and society ahead. Therefore, after seizing power, whether to be content with the status quo and stand aloof, or to be humble and cautious and continue the revolution, is an important indicator of whether one is a true revolutionary or a fake one.

	Some comrades in the revolutionary forces believe that once the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are exposed and their power is seized, the ultimate goal of the Cultural Revolution is achieved. This is a very wrong idea and a concrete manifestation of bourgeois ideology infiltrating our revolutionary ranks.

	The most fundamental task for the proletarian revolutionary forces after achieving victory in the struggle for power is to arm and transform people with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to smash the "self" and establish the "public," and to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. If someone regards seizing power as the end of the revolution, they will inevitably neglect the ideological revolution, not pay attention to the ideological education of the masses, and relax their own ideological transformation. Such a person will inevitably seek to stand out, compete for positions, and advocate independence, resulting in the removal of revisionist elements from office and the seizure of power, but the revisionist ideology continues to wreak havoc. This is like cutting leeks with a knife, and if it continues, one may also become a revisionist. This point should be highly alerted to.

### 是起点，不是终点

专栏：来信

    从上海开始的“一月革命”的风暴席卷全国。在某些地方，某些部门，被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派盘踞的堡垒，一个又一个被无产阶级革命大军攻克了，夺取了。无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争取得了伟大胜利。但是，夺权与反夺权的斗争还在继续，有的地方出现了资本主义复辟的逆流。
    当前，放在无产阶级革命派战士们面前的一个重大问题是：在取得了夺权斗争的胜利以后，怎么办？
    许多读者给本报来信，对这个问题发表了很好的意见。现在选出四篇，摘要发表如下。　　　　　　　　　——编　者
    是起点，不是终点
    资产阶级革命，只要把政权夺到手，就达到了最终目的。而无产阶级革命派取得夺权胜利以后，大量而艰苦地改造人、改造社会的工作，还在前面。
    资产阶级的革命，只要把政权夺到手，就万事大吉了，就可以依靠夺到的权力，大刮民脂民膏，大肥私人腰包。但是对于我们无产阶级革命派来说，取得夺权胜利以后，更大量、更艰苦、更细致的改造人和改造社会的工作，还在前面。因此，在夺权以后，是满足现状，高高在上，还是谦虚谨慎，继续革命，这是衡量真革命还是假革命的一个重要标志。
    有些革命派的同志认为：把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来，把他们窃踞的权夺到自己手里，就算达到了文化大革命的最终目的。这是很错误的想法，是资产阶级思想侵入我们革命队伍的具体反映。
    无产阶级革命派在取得夺权胜利以后，一项最根本的任务，就是要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去武装人，改造人，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，促使人的思想革命化。如果谁把夺权看成了革命的终点，就必然会忽视思想革命，不重视对群众的思想教育，更放松自己的思想改造。这样的人必然是热中于出风头，争地位，闹独立性，其结果是把修正主义分子的官罢了，权夺过来了，但修正主义的思想仍在为非作歹，这就象是刀割韭菜刀刀发，发展下去，自己也就可能变成修正主义分子。这一点，应当引起人们的高度警惕。
