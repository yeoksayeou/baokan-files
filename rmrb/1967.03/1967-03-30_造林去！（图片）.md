Off to Plant Trees!

The Shandong Art School Revolutionary Committee reports:

	In the spring of 1967, the students and teachers of the Shandong Art School, with great enthusiasm, went to the mountains to plant trees. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teachings, they bravely took up the task of afforestation. In just a few days, they planted 120,000 trees, transforming the barren mountains into lush green forests.

	The students and teachers of the Shandong Art School have shown great initiative and enthusiasm in this afforestation campaign. They not only planted trees but also learned from the local peasants about the techniques of afforestation. They worked together with the peasants, sharing their labor and experiences, and fostering a deep bond of friendship.

	This afforestation campaign has not only improved the environment but also enriched the students' and teachers' understanding of agriculture and nature. It has also strengthened their revolutionary spirit and determination to serve the people.

	The Shandong Art School Revolutionary Committee calls on all revolutionary students and teachers to follow the example of the Shandong Art School and actively participate in afforestation campaigns. Let us all work together to transform our barren mountains into lush green forests and build a prosperous socialist countryside!
