The Soviet revisionist leadership is following in the footsteps of U.S. imperialism. Recently, they have shown great interest in the "Foreign Investment Law" of the Indonesian right-wing military regime. They openly expressed their willingness to invest in Indonesia according to this law and to expand trade with Indonesia, thereby providing lifelines to the Indonesian reactionaries who are besieged both internally and externally.

According to a report by the Jakarta radio on the 21st, this was stated by an official of the Soviet revisionist trade agency in Jakarta on the 20th to the chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The "Foreign Investment Law" of Indonesia was passed by the puppet parliament of the Indonesian right-wing military regime on December 24 last year. This law, which sells out national interests on a large scale, grants many special benefits to foreign capital investing in Indonesia. Subsequently, on January 7 of this year, the Indonesian right-wing military regime further developed this law and signed a sellout agreement with the United States, opening wide the doors for U.S. monopolistic capital to plunder and exploit Indonesia.

The Soviet revisionists' expression of willingness to invest in Indonesia indicates that they want to further strengthen their joint actions with U.S. imperialism in supporting the Indonesian right-wing military regime and in suppressing and exploiting the Indonesian people.

    苏修热心为印尼反动派输血
    公然表示愿意在印尼投资并扩大同印尼的贸易
    新华社二十三日讯 雅加达消息：苏联修正主义领导集团紧跟美帝国主义的脚印，最近对印度尼西亚右派军人政权的“外国投资法令”很感兴趣，公然表示愿意根据这个法令在印尼投资，并且愿意扩大同印尼的贸易，为内外交困的印尼反动派输血。
    据雅加达电台二十一日透露，这是苏修驻雅加达的商务机构官员二十日向印尼工商会主席表示的。
    印尼“外国投资法案”是印尼右派军人政权的御用议会在去年十二月二十四日通过的。这项大规模出卖民族利益的法案对向印尼投资的外国资本给予许多特殊利益。随后，在今年一月七日，印尼右派军人政权进一步发展了这个法案，又同美国签订了一项卖国协定，为美国垄断资本在印尼进行掠夺和剥削大开方便之门。
    苏修表示要在印尼投资，表明它要同美帝国主义在支持印尼右派军人政权、镇压和剥削印尼人民方面，进一步加强联合行动。
