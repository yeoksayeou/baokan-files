Edition: 4

Cadres who implement the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary line with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core are a precious asset of the Party and the people. They can and should become the leading force in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These leading cadres should maintain close ties with the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses, and stand at the forefront of the mass movement. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations should support them.

    执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，是党和人民的宝贵财富。他们可以而且能够成为向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的领导力量。这些领导干部应该密切联系群众，集中广大群众的智慧，站在群众运动的前列。革命群众和革命群众组织应当支持他们。
