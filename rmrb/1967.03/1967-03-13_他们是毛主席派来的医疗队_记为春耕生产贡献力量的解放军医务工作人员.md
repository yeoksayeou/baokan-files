Recently, many medical personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have rushed to the front lines of spring plowing and production, actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the people, and enthusiastically treating diseases for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. This has inspired the enthusiasm of the community members and promoted spring plowing and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise them as "the medical teams sent by Chairman Mao."

Bringing Chairman Mao's Care and Warmth

After Chairman Mao and the Central Committee issued the great call to support spring agricultural production, the medical department of a certain division of the Guangxi garrison immediately mobilized and formed a team of more than thirty people to support spring agricultural production. They divided into five groups, carrying Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production," and carrying deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, they went deep into five communes and nearly a hundred production brigades in the garrison area. They actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought and enthusiastically served the revolutionary masses.

The medical personnel of the troops went out early and returned late every day, going to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants and to the fields and edges of the production brigades. Regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, whether it was a regular day or a holiday, they labored alongside the community members while understanding the disease situation and treating the community members. In the more than ten days since they went to the countryside, they have treated more than five hundred poor and lower-middle peasants. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: During the busy spring plowing season, the comrades from the Liberation Army came down to treat us, which is like "sending charcoal in the snow." They brought Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's care and warmth to us poor and lower-middle peasants.

During the process of treating the poor and lower-middle peasants, the medical team members also actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the great situation of the Cultural Revolution. Wherever they went, they helped the poor and lower-middle peasants study Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" and Chairman Mao's teachings on "mobilizing the masses, paying attention to hygiene, reducing diseases, and improving health levels." They actively propagated the significance and knowledge of disease prevention, and enthusiastically trained health personnel for the production brigades. Through the active efforts and enthusiastic help of the medical team members, the incidence rate of diseases among the community members in the garrison area has significantly decreased, and the labor attendance rate has significantly increased. Currently, spring plowing and production in these production brigades are booming.

Caring for Others More Than Oneself

Recently, all the officers and soldiers of the medical team of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production," the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Various Levels of Cadres in All Rural People's Communes Across the Country," and Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Work Methods." They have raised their awareness and, while guarding their battle positions and strengthening their preparedness, organized six medical teams to go to the front lines of agricultural production. They went deep into the fields and farmlands, propagating Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" to the broad revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasant community members. They also actively participated in the production brigades' fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, and spring sowing production labor. They enthusiastically treated diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants, helped the production brigades train health and sanitation personnel, and propagated the importance of health and disease prevention to the broad revolutionary farmers for grasping revolution and promoting production.

The medical team members remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "caring for others more than oneself," urgently addressing the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and thinking about what the poor and lower-middle peasants were thinking about. They wholeheartedly served them. When the medical team members arrived at the nearby Bozhong Brigade, they discovered that this brigade was plagued by an acute disease. If this disease continued to spread, it would affect the current spring plowing and production. Therefore, while actively treating the disease, they enthusiastically propagated to the broad revolutionary masses the relationship and great significance between preventing diseases and doing a good job in the current spring plowing and production. They mobilized the masses and relied on the broad masses to jointly do a good job in health and disease prevention. Military doctor Liu Changsheng led two medical personnel to participate in the production brigade's pre-plowing work while also training eighteen health and sanitation personnel for the brigade. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "being thrifty to make revolution" and collected traditional Chinese medicine locally. Using simple and effective folk remedies, they gave the community members preventive medicine, effectively stopping the spread of this acute disease, ensuring the health of the revolutionary masses, significantly increasing the attendance rate, and promoting spring plowing and production.

On the front lines of spring plowing and production, the spirit of the medical personnel of the Liberation Army, "caring for others more than oneself," is everywhere. Poor peasant community member Wei Yangnong's young son accidentally fell into the water and stopped breathing. The military medical personnel, without caring about the dirty water in the child's mouth, immediately performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The broad community members, seeing this, were all moved. The poor peasant community member Kong Suolian of Chengdong Brigade suddenly had a high fever one night. After the medical team members treated her, she turned from danger to safety. They then sent her vegetables, food, and clothes, and read Chairman Mao's quotations to her. Kong Suolian gratefully said: "It is Chairman Mao and the Liberation Army that gave me a second life. I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books well and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on 'grasping revolution and promoting production' to do a good job in this year's spring plowing and production!"

Chairman Mao's Taught Soldiers Are Truly Good

In recent days, the mobile medical team composed of medical personnel from the garrison in Zhejiang, carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the letter from the Central Committee, has braved hardships and crossed mountains and rivers to go deep into the front lines of spring plowing and production, enthusiastically serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The mobile medical team members sent by a certain unit's medical department came to a nearby people's commune, hanging Chairman Mao's portraits in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, sending "Three Articles," and propagating the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" and the letter from the Central Committee. At the same time, they enthusiastically treated diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Old poor peasant Zhang Danniang had a severe cold. The medical team members carefully treated him, making him quickly recover his health. They also helped him cook noodles, wash clothes, and clean the courtyard. Zhang Danniang gratefully shook hands with the comrades from the Liberation Army, looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and excitedly said: "The soldiers taught by Chairman Mao are truly good! I will definitely work harder for spring plowing and production!"

The medical team of a certain unit's medical department of the Hangzhou Air Force in rural mobile medical treatment, carried forward the spirit of our army's bravery in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat. They had to travel tens of miles back and forth, but they never complained about hardship or fatigue. Nurse Ye Meizhen had several blisters on her feet, and walking was very painful. However, when she thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," she regained her strength and insisted on working. While preventing and treating diseases, they also propagated to the community members Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and the letter from the Central Committee, as well as spring hygiene and epidemic prevention knowledge, greatly inspiring the community members' enthusiasm for production.

Some military medical units near rural areas have also taken measures to better serve spring plowing and production and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. The medical clinic of a certain unit directly under the provincial military region specially designated every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday during the spring plowing season as outpatient days for poor and lower-middle peasant community members. On these days, they treated nearly a hundred community members each day. All the personnel in the clinic were often so busy that they didn't have time to eat. They said, working for the health of the poor and lower-middle peasant community members is supporting spring plowing and production.

	Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support. This is the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xi'an supporting spring plowing and production, studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with community members.

    他们是毛主席派来的医疗队
    ——记为春耕生产贡献力量的解放军医务工作人员
    最近，中国人民解放军许多医务工作人员纷纷奔赴春耕生产第一线，积极向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，热情地为广大贫下中农看病，激发了社员们的积极性，促进了春耕生产，贫下中农称赞他们是“毛主席派来的医疗队”。
    送来了毛主席的关怀和温暖
    毛主席、党中央关于支援农业春耕生产的伟大号召发出后，广西驻军某师的卫生部门闻风而动，立即组成了一支三十多人的支援春耕生产的医疗队。他们分成五个组，带着毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，带着对贫下中农深厚的阶级感情，深入到驻地五个公社近百个生产队，积极宣传毛泽东思想，热情地为革命群众服务。
    部队医务工作人员每天早出晚归，到贫下中农家里，到生产队的田头地边，不管晴天雨天，不论平时或假日，都是一边同社员群众一起劳动，一边了解病情，替社员们诊断治疗。他们下乡十多天以来，就给贫下中农看病五百多人次，许多贫下中农说：春耕大忙时节，解放军同志下来给我们看病，这是给我们“雪里送炭”，是把毛主席、党中央的关怀和温暖送给了我们贫下中农。
    医疗队的同志在给贫下中农看病过程中，还积极宣传毛泽东思想，宣传文化大革命的大好形势。他们走到那里，就帮助那里的贫下中农学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，和毛主席“动员起来，讲究卫生，减少疾病，提高健康水平”等教导，积极宣传防病意义和防病知识，热情培养生产队的卫生人员。经过医疗队同志的积极努力和热情帮助，驻地生产队社员群众发病率大大减少，劳动出勤率大大增加。目前，这些生产队里，春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    关心他人比关心自己为重
    最近，广州部队某部卫生队全体指战员，认真学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示、《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等光辉著作，提高了认识，在坚守战斗岗位，加强战备的同时，组织了六个医疗队开赴农业生产第一线，深入地头田间，向广大革命群众和贫下中农社员宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，和贫下中农社员一起学习毛主席著作。同时，他们还积极参加生产队积肥、修水利、春播等生产劳动，并且热心为贫下中农治病，帮助生产队培养卫生保健员，向广大革命农民宣传卫生防病对抓革命促生产的重要意义。
    医疗队的同志，牢记毛主席“关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导，急贫下中农之所急，想贫下中农之所想，全心全意为他们服务。医疗队的同志来到驻地附近葟竹大队时，发现这个大队流行着一种急性病。这种病如果再蔓延下去，就要影响当前的春耕生产。于是，他们在积极治疗的同时，热情地向广大革命群众宣传预防疾病和搞好当前春耕生产的关系及其重大意义，放手发动群众，依靠广大群众，共同搞好卫生防病工作。军医刘长胜带领两个卫生员在参加生产队里的备耕工作的同时，还为大队培训了十八名卫生保健员，他们遵照毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的教导，在本地采集中药，用简易有效的土方土法，给社员服预防药，及时地有效地制止了这种急性病的流行，保障了革命群众的身体健康，大大提高了出勤率，推动了春耕生产。
    在春耕生产战线上，解放军医务工作人员“关心他人比关心自己为重”的精神到处体现。贫农社员韦杨农的小儿子不慎落水，停止了呼吸。部队卫生员顾不得小孩口腔里流出的污水，立即进行口对口人工呼吸。广大社员见到这种情况，无不感动。城东大队贫农社员孔素莲一天夜里突然发高烧，医疗队的同志经过治疗使她转危为安后，又给她送菜送饭，送衣服，给她念毛主席语录。孔素莲感激地说：“是毛主席，是解放军给了我第二次生命，我一定要好好地读毛主席的书，坚决执行毛主席提出的‘抓革命，促生产’的方针，搞好今年的春耕生产！”
    毛主席教导出来的战士真好
    连日来，由驻浙江部队医务人员组成的巡回医疗队，带着《毛主席语录》和党中央的信，不怕劳累，跋山涉水，深入春耕生产第一线，热心为贫下中农服务。
    某部卫生科派出的巡回医疗队的同志，来到驻地附近人民公社，一面给贫下中农家里挂毛主席像，送“老三篇”，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示和党中央的信的伟大意义，一面热心地给贫下中农治病。老贫农张大牛患重感冒。医疗队的同志细心地给他治疗，使他很快恢复了健康，同时还帮他煮面条，洗衣服，打扫院子。张大牛感激地握着解放军同志的手，望着墙上的毛主席像激动地说：“毛主席教导出来的战士真好！我一定要为春耕生产多出力！”
    驻杭州空军某部卫生科的医疗组在农村巡回医疗中，发扬了我军勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，往返巡回要跑几十里路，他们从不叫苦叫累。护士叶美珍脚上打了好几个泡，走路很痛，但是当她想起毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导时，又鼓起了劲头，坚持工作。他们在防病治病的同时，还向社员宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召和党中央的信，宣传春季卫生防疫常识，极大地鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。
    一些靠近农村的部队卫生单位，也采取了措施，更好地为春耕生产服务，为贫下中农服务。省军区直属队某部门诊所，春耕期间专门规定每周星期一、三、六作为贫下中农社员的门诊时间。在这几天里，每天平均给近百位社员看病。全所人员经常忙得顾不上吃饭。他们说，为贫下中农社员身体健康出力，就是支援春耕生产。
