Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have decided that the People's Liberation Army will actively assist local areas in supporting industrial production work. This is the greatest trust and encouragement for our army. Troops stationed in Shenyang, Wuxi, Chongqing, Harbin, and other places have dispatched large numbers of cadres and soldiers to enter local factories and mines, helping them to seize the revolution and promote production. This has created excellent experiences and set a good example for our army in implementing Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's decisions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in factories and mines and promoting industrial production are major issues that concern the success or failure of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. While vigorously supporting spring farming production, it is our army's unavoidable major responsibility and a glorious task to actively help factories and mines seize the revolution and promote production.

How do we support factories and mines in seizing the revolution and promoting production? The most fundamental thing is to support them politically and ideologically, arming the broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. Based on the experiences of some units, we must do a good job of propaganda and investigation.

Propaganda means propagating the great Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and propagating the Party's various policies and guidelines. It means working with the workers and revolutionary cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various problems.

The locomotive that drives the revolution and production forward is the great Mao Zedong Thought. Spreading Chairman Mao's voice, propagating the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and propagating the Party's policies and guidelines are what the revolutionary masses welcome most and what the class enemies fear most. Once the broad masses of workers grasp Mao Zedong Thought and deeply understand the great significance of seizing the revolution and promoting production, they will have the greatest courage, boundless wisdom, and boundless enthusiasm. They will unite to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

To seize the revolution and promote production, we must conduct investigations and research, understand the situation, and solve the problems of relying on whom, uniting with whom, and striking whom.

We must conduct thorough and detailed investigations and research to distinguish between friends and enemies. Only in this way can we have a clear understanding of the situation and firm resolve. Only in this way can we correctly identify the leftists, recognize the enemies, and thus resolutely and powerfully support and rely on the genuine revolutionary leftists, develop, strengthen, and consolidate the revolutionary leftist forces, unite the broad masses, and form a good "three-in-one combination" to severely strike the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries who disrupt the revolution and production.

Only by doing a good job of investigation work and grasping the living thoughts can we distinguish different objects, target different problems, and conduct propaganda that hits the mark, closely linking the spirit of the Party Central Committee with the actual situation below, and fully unleashing the great power of Mao Zedong Thought.

In supporting factories and mines in seizing the revolution and promoting production, we must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the "Sixteen Points" on the cultural revolution, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and not do things for them. Only in this way can we arouse the revolutionary initiative and creativity of the broad masses of workers, use the revolution to lead production, drive production, and launch a new high tide in industrial production.

Our army is a fighting force and also a work team. "Apart from fighting to destroy the enemy's military forces, it also has to undertake major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary governments, and even establishing Communist Party organizations." We have always been with the people. In the countryside, we have blended in with the laboring peasants, and in the cities, we have blended in with the workers and other revolutionary masses, always doing mass work. We must let this glorious tradition be further carried forward in this struggle to support the revolutionary leftists and in completing the strategic task of supporting the industrial and agricultural fronts to seize the revolution and promote production.

Chairman Mao says: "The working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." Supporting factories and mines in seizing the revolution and promoting production is our best opportunity to learn from the working class and the best classroom to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Cadres and soldiers entering factories and mines must live, work, and study with the broad masses of workers, and in the common struggle with the workers to seize the revolution and promote production, strive to temper and improve themselves, and strengthen their ideological revolutionization.

The deepening of the proletarian cultural revolution in factories and mines is a powerful driving force for the development of industrial production. Let us, together with the broad revolutionary cadres of factories and mines, make every effort to welcome the dual victories of revolution and production!

    积极支援厂矿企业抓革命促生产
    毛主席和党中央决定，人民解放军大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作，这是对我军最大的信任和最大的鼓舞。驻沈阳、无锡、重庆、哈尔滨等地的部队，派出大批干部战士，深入当地厂矿企业，帮助他们抓革命、促生产，为我军贯彻执行毛主席和党中央的决定，创造了很好的经验，作出了很好的榜样。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”搞好厂矿企业的无产阶级文化大革命，促进工业生产，是关系到我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设成败的大问题。在大力支援春耕生产的同时，积极帮助厂矿企业抓革命、促生产，是我军义不容辞的重大责任，是我军支持无产阶级革命派的一项光荣任务。
    怎样支援厂矿企业抓革命、促生产呢？最根本的就是从政治上、思想上去支援他们，用毛泽东思想去武装广大工人群众和革命干部的头脑。根据一些部队的经验，必须很好地做宣传，做调查。
    做宣传，就是宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，宣传党的各项方针政策。就是同工人群众和革命干部一起，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想回答和解决各种问题。
    引导革命和生产胜利前进的火车头，是伟大的毛泽东思想。传播毛主席的声音，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，宣传党的方针政策，革命群众最欢迎，阶级敌人最害怕。广大工人群众掌握了毛泽东思想，深刻地领会了抓革命、促生产的伟大意义，就有最大的勇敢，无限的智慧，冲天的干劲，就会齐心合力地挑起革命、生产的两副重担。
    抓革命，促生产，都要调查研究，弄清情况，解决依靠谁，团结谁，打击谁的问题。
    我们一定要通过深入细致的调查研究，分清敌我。这样才能情况明，决心大。只有这样，才能正确地识别左派，认清敌人，从而坚决地有力地支持和紧紧依靠真正的革命左派，发展、壮大、巩固革命左派队伍，团结广大群众，搞好革命的“三结合”，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决镇压破坏革命、破坏生产的反革命分子。
    也只有做好调查工作，抓好活思想，才能够区别不同的对象，针对不同的问题，有的放矢地做宣传，使党中央的精神和下面的实际紧密地结合起来，充分发挥毛泽东思想的巨大威力。
    在支援厂矿企业抓革命、促生产的工作中，我们要坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决执行文化革命十六条，要相信群众，依靠群众，用毛泽东思想武装群众，而不要包办代替。这样才能激发广大工人群众的革命积极性和创造性，用革命统帅生产，带动生产，掀起工业生产的新高潮。
    我军是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队。“它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”我们从来都是和人民群众在一起，在农村，同劳动农民打成一片，在城市，同工人和其他革命群众打成一片，随时都做群众工作。我们要让这个光荣传统，在这次支援革命左派的斗争中，在完成支援工农业战线抓革命、促生产的战略任务中，进一步发扬光大。
    毛主席说：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性”。支援厂矿企业抓革命、促生产，是我们向工人阶级学习最好的机会，是我们活学活用毛主席著作最好的课堂。进入厂矿企业的干部战士，要同广大工人群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，在同工人群众抓革命、促生产的共同斗争中，努力锻炼自己，提高自己，加强思想革命化。
    厂矿企业无产阶级文化大革命的深入开展，是促进工业生产发展的强大动力。让我们同厂矿企业的广大革命职工一起，用百倍的努力，去迎接革命和生产的双胜利！
