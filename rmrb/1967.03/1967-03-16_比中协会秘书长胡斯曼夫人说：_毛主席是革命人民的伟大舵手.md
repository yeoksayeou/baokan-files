Madame Husmann, Secretary-General of the Belgian-China Association, said: Chairman Mao is the Great Helmsman of the Revolutionary People

According to Xinhua News Agency, Madame Husmann, Secretary-General of the Belgian-China Association, who recently visited China, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency before leaving China: "Mao Zedong Thought is not only a weapon for leading the Chinese people to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, but also a weapon for the people of the world to carry out revolution. By using this powerful weapon, imperialism and modern revisionism can be defeated, and the system of man exploiting man can be eliminated. Chairman Mao Zedong is the great helmsman guiding the people of the world in their struggle for liberation."

During her more than forty days in China, Madame Husmann visited Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, and other cities, and toured the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an and Chairman Mao's hometown of Shaoshan. When talking about her impressions of her visit to China, she said, "This is my fifth visit to New China. What impressed me most this time was the change in people's spiritual outlook. Whether they are workers, peasants, herdsmen, or youth, they are all actively studying Mao Zedong Thought to change their thinking. They are carrying out the socialist revolution and are preparing in thought and morality for the future transition to communism. Mao Zedong Thought is the weapon for creating new communist people."

When talking about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, she said, "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can prevent the restoration of capitalism and push the world revolution forward. This is a great encouragement to the people of the whole world. The Cultural Revolution in China not only defends the socialist revolution in China but also defends the world revolution." She said, "The young generation in China and the Red Guards have unlimited love for Chairman Mao Zedong and unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They are defending the red mountains and rivers of China."

    比中协会秘书长胡斯曼夫人说：
    毛主席是革命人民的伟大舵手
    据新华社讯　不久前访问中国的比利时中国协会秘书长玛尔德·胡斯曼夫人，在离开中国时对新华社记者发表谈话说：“毛泽东思想不仅是领导中国人民把社会主义革命进行到底的武器，也是世界人民进行革命的武器。运用这个强大武器，就能战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义，就能消灭人剥削人的制度。毛泽东主席是引导世界人民争取解放的伟大舵手。”
    胡斯曼夫人在中国逗留的四十多天里，先后访问了北京、上海、太原等城市，参观了革命圣地延安和毛主席的故乡韶山。她在谈到访华观感时说，这是我第五次访问新中国了。这次给我印象最深的是人的精神面貌的变化。无论工人、农民、牧民还是青年，都在积极学习毛泽东思想，来改变他们的思想。他们正在进行社会主义革命，并且在思想上、道德上准备将来向共产主义过渡。毛泽东思想是造就共产主义新人的武器。
    她在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时说，中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就能防止资本主义复辟，并且把世界革命推向前进。这对全世界人民是一个很大的鼓舞。中国的文化大革命不仅保卫中国的社会主义革命，而且也保卫了世界革命。她说，中国青年一代和红卫兵无限热爱毛泽东主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想。他们捍卫着中国的红色江山。
