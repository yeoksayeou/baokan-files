The military and civilians of the Vinh Linh District in North Vietnam launched a fierce artillery barrage on the U.S. artillery base in the Du Lap area of Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, on March 20 and 21, inflicting heavy losses. The Vietnam News Agency has reprinted a report by a correspondent from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam who witnessed the victory. The report describes the jubilation of the local people over this victory and the disarray of the U.S. aggressors after the shelling.

The report states that at 6:19 PM on March 20, the U.S. artillery units in the Du Lap area fired numerous shells across the Ben Hai River. The local people, witnessing the new crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors against their compatriots across the demarcation line, were filled with indignation. Liberation Army soldiers, closely monitoring the enemy's movements, marked the enemy's artillery positions on the map. The aggressors' crimes would surely be punished.

Suddenly, blue, yellow, and red fireballs soared towards the enemy's artillery positions in Du Lap, accompanied by thunderous explosions. It was 6:20 PM, just one minute after the U.S. aggressors had opened fire on the Vinh Linh District. A reconnaissance soldier of the Liberation Armed Forces, upon confirming the situation, excitedly shouted, "Comrades, that's our brothers firing back!"

Rain-like shells fell on the U.S. artillery base, silencing every American gun. The U.S. aggressors abandoned their artillery pieces and fled towards the shelters or into the bushes. But it was too late. Many were killed under their own gun barrels, while others were burned to death in the trenches. The U.S. Marine Corps also did not escape. The artillery fire from the North relentlessly swept through their hiding places, killing many and destroying their parking lot, where dozens of trucks were blown to pieces. Some shells landed on the airfield's apron, shredding many helicopters.

Every shell fired from the North towards the U.S. base was met with cheers from the local people.

Still reeling from the heavy blow, the U.S. aggressors were struck again at 1:30 AM on March 21. The military and civilians of the Vinh Linh District launched a second fierce assault, completely destroying what remained of the U.S. artillery positions in the Du Lap area. The base was littered with twisted gun barrels, wrecked helicopters, amphibious armored vehicles, and burned-out military trucks.

To hide their losses, the U.S. aggressors sealed off all routes to the Du Lap artillery base for an entire day. But it was futile. Every time the people of Quang Tri passed by Du Lap, they saw the chaotic state of the U.S. aggressors' base and warned, "Don't boast about your long-range cannons. We can strike back with the same weapons!"

    严厉的惩罚　有力的打击
    南越育庙美军炮兵基地遭到炮轰目击记
    新华社河内二十八日电　越南北方永灵区军民，二十日和二十一日用猛烈的炮火，向越南南方广治省犹灵县育庙地区的美军炮兵基地，进行了惩罚性的还击，取得巨大战果。越南通讯社转发了目睹这场胜利的炮击的一位越南南方解放通讯社记者一篇报道。这篇报道记述了当地人民为这一胜利而欢欣鼓舞，和美国侵略军在遭到炮击后的狼狈情景。
    报道中说，三月二十日下午六点十九分，育庙地区的美国炮兵部队向边海河北岸发射了许多发炮弹。当地人民看到美国侵略者对分界河对面的同胞犯下的新的罪行，感到十分愤慨。密切注视敌人动静的解放军战士咬紧嘴唇，在地图上标下了敌人的炮位。侵略者的罪行必将受到加倍的惩罚。
    突然，蓝色、黄色和红色火球在雷鸣般的爆炸声中飞向育庙的敌人炮兵阵地。这时是下午六点二十分，即美国侵略军向永灵区开炮后仅一分钟。解放武装力量的一位侦察兵在判明情况后，万分激动地高呼：“同志们，这是我们那边的兄弟打的炮！”
    阵雨般的炮弹落在美军炮兵基地上，打得美国侵略军的大炮没有一门能发出声音来。美国侵略军丢下他们的大炮，纷纷向防空洞或灌木林里逃命。但是，已经来不及了。他们中的许多人就在他们的炮筒下被打死了，另外一些在壕沟里被烧焦。美国海军陆战队也未能逃脱。北方军民的炮火直朝他们的掩蔽所猛扫过来，跟踪追击，不少美军被打死，停车场也被炮弹击中，几十辆卡车被炸得粉碎。一些炮弹落在机场的停机坪上，把许多直升飞机炸成碎片。
    从北方向美军基地打过来的每一发炮弹，都引起当地人民的一阵欢呼。
    美国侵略者遭到这样沉重打击，还在惊魂未定的时候，二十一日清晨一点半，永灵区军民又发动了第二次猛攻，把育庙地区美军炮兵阵地上残存的东西全部给摧毁了。这个阵地上到处是变弯了的炮筒、直升飞机、两栖装甲车和烧坏了的军用卡车的残骸。
    为了隐瞒他们的损失，美国侵略者把育庙炮兵阵地的一切通道封锁了整整一天。但是没有用处。犹灵人民每次经过育庙，看到美国侵略者一片狼藉的阵地，警告说：“不要吹嘘你们的远程大炮了。我们也会用同样的武器来还击！”（附图片）
