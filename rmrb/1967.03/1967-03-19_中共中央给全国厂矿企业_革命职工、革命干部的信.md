Comrades, workers, and staff members! Revolutionary cadres in factories and mines!

The working class is the leading force in our socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Chairman Mao calls on you, and the Party Central Committee calls on you to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We hope that in this great proletarian cultural revolution, under these new conditions, you will redouble your efforts, strive to be the best, and become the most outstanding models of seizing the revolution and promoting production among the laboring masses in this stage.

We hope that you will be models in firmly carrying out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and in criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line.

We hope that you will be models in firmly carrying out the Party Central Committee's decisions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We hope that you will be models in fighting against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

We hope that you will be models in implementing revolutionary great alliances, and in opposing factionalism, anarchism, extremism, economism, and selfishness.

You should strengthen labor discipline, uphold the principle of democratic centralism, and establish good order for socialist production and the cultural revolution.

You should, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's stipulations, adhere to the eight-hour workday. Outside of the eight-hour workday, you should persist in the cultural revolution. It is not allowed to leave the production or work post without authorization during production time. You should struggle against phenomena such as absenteeism and shoddy work.

You should, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's stipulations, promote your own ideological transformation in the cultural revolution, produce quickly, efficiently, economically, and with high quality, and strive for high-quality products. You should struggle against phenomena such as disregarding quality and wasting state resources.

All workers in factories and mines must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study the experience of streamlining administration and reducing personnel. You should greatly reduce personnel who are detached from production and greatly improve work efficiency. You should pay attention to economizing while making revolution. Generally, personnel in workers' organizations should not be detached from production.

All workers in factories and mines must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enhance the great sense of responsibility as masters of the state, and take good care of state property. Those who damage state property must be severely punished according to state laws.

The Party Central Committee calls on all revolutionary cadres working in factories and mines to take the lead in doing a good job in all aspects of work, and to make every effort to complete and overfulfill the state production plan and state construction plan.

The Party Central Committee believes that the majority of cadres in all factories and mines are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes should conduct strict self-criticism, and in the cultural revolution, should strive to study Chairman Mao's works, strive to be good students of the masses, reform themselves in their work, and make amends for their mistakes. As long as cadres who have made mistakes do this, the worker masses should understand and support their work. Criticism of them should adopt Chairman Mao's long-standing instruction of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient."

Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated factories and mines must absolutely not create disturbances and sabotage production, sabotage the unity among workers, and create and incite factional strife. Their handling should be dealt with according to their political stance, work attitude, and the specific situation of the factory and mine.

The Party Central Committee has decided that the People's Liberation Army will greatly assist the local areas and support industrial production work. You should cooperate well with the comrades of the People's Liberation Army.

It is suggested that all workers in factories and mines discuss this letter issued by the Central Committee in their spare time.

Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, unite!

Wish you a heroic struggle for a double harvest in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial production!

(This letter should be read and posted in all factories and basic construction units.)
