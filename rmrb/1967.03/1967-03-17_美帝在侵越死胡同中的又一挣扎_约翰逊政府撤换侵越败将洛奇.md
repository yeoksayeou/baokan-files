In the face of the continuous victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and the repeated severe setbacks suffered by American imperialism, Lodge, who has twice served as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam and has steadfastly pushed forward the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam, has resigned his post as ambassador and is about to pack up and return home.

Lodge's resignation was announced by U.S. President Johnson on March 15 during a speech to the Tennessee State Legislature. At the same time, he announced the appointment of Ambassador-at-Large Bunker to succeed Lodge. Bunker has previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Argentina, among other positions. He had acted as the U.S. "mediator" in 1965-1966 to suppress the patriotic anti-American struggle of the people of the Dominican Republic.

Johnson also appointed the current U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Eugene Murphy Locke, as Bunker's deputy, replacing the current deputy ambassador William Porter. Additionally, he announced the strengthening of the U.S. military command in Vietnam by appointing Komer, the special assistant for "pacification" in South Vietnam, to serve as an assistant to the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland.

Just as the United States is frantically pursuing a two-pronged strategy of war and "peace" in Vietnam and is preparing to hold a war conference in Guam, Johnson is taking these measures. This not only shows that American imperialism is increasingly defeated and has no way out in Vietnam, but also shows that American imperialism is unwilling to retreat and is preparing for more reckless war adventures and more sinister "peace" plots. Johnson's speech, given at the same time as the announcement of these measures, also proves this point. He shouted that the United States is determined to "defend" South Vietnam, and that "reciprocity must be the basic principle of any reduction in hostile actions, unless the other side reduces, the United States will not reduce its (military) activities."

Lodge, who is regarded by the U.S. ruling class as a champion of aggressive policy, has twice been sent to South Vietnam in 1963 and 1965, both times during deep crises in the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam. However, this ardent advocate and executor of the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam, along with the military leader Taylor who replaced him in 1964, have not been able to save American imperialism from its fate of failure in Vietnam. Whether it is the civilian or military leaders of American imperialism, they have all been defeated and are at a loss in the face of the brave and resolute struggle of the Vietnamese people.

In recent speeches, Lodge has had to admit that the United States has "not won" the war in Vietnam and that its attempt to conquer the Vietnamese people has "not been that smooth." He fully revealed the desperate and fearful appearance of the American aggressors in South Vietnam. He said that during his time in South Vietnam, he would "worry every morning" about whether the South Vietnamese people's armed forces had achieved another major victory.

The flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression have driven away the war demon Lodge. The flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression will also drive out all the big and small, various war demons that American imperialism sends to South Vietnam.

### 美帝在侵越死胡同中的又一挣扎  约翰逊政府撤换侵越败将洛奇

    美帝在侵越死胡同中的又一挣扎 
    约翰逊政府撤换侵越败将洛奇
    新华社十六日讯　华盛顿消息：在越南人民抗美救国战争不断取得胜利，美帝国主义屡遭重大挫败的局势下，两度出任美国驻南越“大使”，坚决推行美帝侵越政策的洛奇，辞去“大使”职务，即将卷起铺盖回国。
    洛奇的辞职是美国总统约翰逊十五日在田纳西州州议会发表演说时宣布的。他同时宣布任命巡回大使邦克继任洛奇的职务。邦克曾担任过美国驻阿根廷大使等职务，他曾在一九六五——一九六六年以美国“调停人”的身份，扼杀了多米尼加人民的爱国反美斗争。
    约翰逊还任命现在的美国驻巴基斯坦大使尤金·墨菲·洛克为邦克的副手，代替现在的副大使威廉·波特，并且宣布要加强侵越美军司令部，任命南越“绥靖”问题特别助理科默去充当侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰的助手。
    正当美国在越南疯狂推行战、“和”两手反革命策略，并且准备即将在关岛举行战争会议的时候，约翰逊采取这样一些措施，既说明了美帝国主义在越南越败越惨，毫无出路，同时也说明了美帝国主义死不回头，要进行更疯狂的战争冒险和策动更阴险的“和谈”阴谋。约翰逊在宣布上述措施的同时发表的演说也证明了这一点。他叫嚷说，美国决心“保卫”南越，“对等必须是任何减少敌对行动的做法中的基本原则，除非对方减少，美国不会减少它的（军事）活动”。
    被美国统治集团视为推行侵略政策干将的洛奇，一九六三年和一九六五年两次出“使”南越，都是在美国的侵越政策发生深重危机的时候，但是，这个美国侵越政策的积极鼓吹者和执行者和在一九六四年接替过他的军人泰勒都没有能够挽救美帝国主义在越南的失败命运。不管是美帝国主义的文官还是武将，在英勇、坚决抗战的越南人民面前，都被打得头破血流，无计可施。
    洛奇在最近接连发表的一些谈话中，不得不承认美国在越南“没有打赢”战争，美国妄图征服越南人民的计划，进行得“不是那末顺利”。他充分流露出美国侵略者在南越的一副狼狈惶惧的丑态。他说，他在南越期间，曾经“每天早晨一起来就担心”，南越人民武装是不是又取得了重大胜利。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的怒火把战争瘟神洛奇送走了。越南人民抗美救国战争的怒火，也必将能把美帝国主义派往南越的大大小小、形形色色的战争瘟神，赶出越南南方。
