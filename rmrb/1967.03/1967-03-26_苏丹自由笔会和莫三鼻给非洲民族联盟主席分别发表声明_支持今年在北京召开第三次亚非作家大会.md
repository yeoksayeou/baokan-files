The Sudan Writers' Association recently issued a statement expressing unconditional support for the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement said: "The Sudan Writers' Association will not consider holding any other conference for this purpose in any other country in the world, and firmly believes that any such attempt will be seen as a divisive action harmful to the unity of Afro-Asian writers, and a poison to the revolutionary thoughts of our people."

The Chairman of the Mozambique African National Union, S. A. Milas, recently issued a statement in Khartoum supporting the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement said: This conference will undoubtedly deal a heavy blow to the repeated attempts by U.S. imperialists and their allies to split the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the revolutionary unity of the Afro-Asian peoples.

The statement said, U.S. imperialism and its allies are plotting to hold a fake third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in Beirut, attempting to challenge the Afro-Asian peoples. However, the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong has already said: "Create trouble, fail, create more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause, and they will not deviate from this logic." The plot of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices to sabotage the unity of Afro-Asian writers and Afro-Asian peoples will definitely be shattered by the success of the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing.

    苏丹自由笔会和莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟主席分别发表声明
    支持今年在北京召开第三次亚非作家大会
    新华社喀土穆电　苏丹自由笔会最近发表声明，表示无保留地支持今年在北京举行第三次亚非作家大会。
    声明说：“苏丹自由笔会将不考虑在世界任何其他国家为这个目的举行任何其他的大会，并且坚定地认为，任何这种企图都将被看作是有害于亚非作家团结的分裂行动，是对我国人民的革命思想的毒害。”
    莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟主席塞·阿·米拉斯最近在喀土穆发表声明，支持今年在北京召开第三次亚非作家大会。
    声明说：这次大会必将对美帝国主义者及其同盟者一再分裂亚非作家运动和亚非人民革命团结的阴谋给予沉重的打击。
    声明说，美帝国主义及其同盟者策划在贝鲁特举行伪亚非作家第三次大会，企图与亚非人民进行较量。但是伟大领袖毛泽东主席早已说过：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义及其同伙企图破坏亚非作家和亚非人民团结的阴谋，一定要被将在北京举行的第三次亚非作家大会的成功所粉碎。
