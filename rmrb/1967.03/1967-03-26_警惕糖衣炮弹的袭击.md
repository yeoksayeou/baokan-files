The class enemy's important tactic in their counter-revolutionary struggle is to use sugar-coated cannonballs to corrupt us. If revolutionary cadres are intoxicated by victory, become arrogant and self-satisfied, consider themselves heroes, and seek enjoyment, they are in danger of being hit.

After the proletarian revolutionary forces have won the power struggle, the class struggle between those in power and those seeking to regain power will continue for a long time. An important tactic of the class enemy in their counter-revolutionary struggle is to use sugar-coated cannonballs to corrupt and win over our ranks, ultimately seizing power. Revolutionary comrades must be highly vigilant against this.

I recall that during the national liberation, our troops were carrying out bandit suppression tasks in Sinnan County, Guizhou Province. At that time, the situation was that we had seized national power and had a powerful People's Liberation Army. A handful of Nationalist remnants were fighting guerrilla warfare against us, and their armed forces were insignificant. At that time, we studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Chairman Mao pointed out: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns, who are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated cannonballs, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." Most comrades followed Chairman Mao's instructions, but there were also a few who were politically complacent, thinking that the power was in our hands and that we had nothing to worry about. The Nationalist bandits, in collusion with landlords, rich peasants, and social dregs, took advantage of this gap in our comrades' thinking and launched a fierce attack on us using money, food, and women. Their words were sweeter than honey, but their hearts were more poisonous than snakes. They used methods such as inviting us to banquets, sending gifts, and introducing partners to drag some of our comrades with weak wills down with them. In some places, power even fell back into the hands of the enemy.

Reflecting on past historical lessons and looking at today's power struggle, we cannot but be highly vigilant.

After the revolutionary forces have won the power struggle, their position has changed. If we are complacent in our thinking and are intoxicated by victory, it will be the enemy's breakthrough point for launching sugar bullet warfare. The class enemy's sugar bullets have no effect on true revolutionaries, but for those who are arrogant, self-satisfied, stagnant, and seek enjoyment, they are a very effective corrosive agent!

Every proletarian revolutionary fighter should firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and become a hero who will not be defeated by either steel bullets or sugar bullets.

    警惕糖衣炮弹的袭击
    阶级敌人进行反夺权斗争的一个重要手法，就是用糖衣炮弹来腐蚀我们。革命派战士如果被胜利冲昏了头脑，骄傲自满，功臣自居，追求享受，就有被击中的危险。
    无产阶级革命派在取得了夺权斗争的胜利以后，掌权与反掌权的阶级斗争还将长期存在。阶级敌人进行反夺权斗争的一个重要手法就是用糖衣炮弹来腐蚀和拉拢我们，最后把政权篡夺过去。革命派同志对这点务必要百倍警惕。
    记得在全国解放时，我们部队在贵州省思南县执行剿匪任务。当时的形势是：我们夺取了全国政权，又有强大的解放军，一小撮国民党的残兵败将和我们“打游击”，他们的武装力量是微不足道的。当时，我们学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告。毛主席指出：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”绝大多数同志都按照毛主席的指示做了，但也有个别同志政治上麻痹，认为印把子、刀把子全掌在我们手里，满不在乎。国民党土匪，串通地主、富农和社会渣滓，就钻了我们同志思想上的这个空子，用金钱计、酒肉计、美人计等向我们展开了猖狂的进攻。他们讲的话比蜜还甜，他们的心比毒蛇还毒，用请客送礼、介绍对象等方法，把我们个别意志薄弱的人拉下了水。个别地方，甚至政权又重新落入敌人的手中。
    想想过去的历史教训，看看今天我们的夺权斗争，不能不引起我们的高度警惕。
    革命派在夺权胜利以后，地位变了。对这个变化如果思想上麻痹，被胜利冲昏了头脑，就是敌人展开糖弹战的突破口。阶级敌人的糖弹，对真正的革命者是起不了一点作用的，而对于那些骄傲自满，功臣自居，停顿不前，贪图享受的意志薄弱者，则是一服很灵的腐蚀剂啊！
    每一个无产阶级革命派战士都应当牢牢记住毛主席的教导，做一个在钢弹和糖弹面前都不会打败仗的英雄。程玉廷
