African freedom fighters held a meeting in Cairo on the evening of the 27th to mark the seventh anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre in Azania. At the meeting, six African nationalist parties and organizations issued a joint statement strongly condemning the crimes of imperialism led by the United States, the South African fascist racist regime, and the Soviet modern revisionists, who are the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism, in sabotaging the African people's liberation movement. They also expressed their warm support for the Azanian people's struggle for national liberation.

The six parties and organizations are the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Basutoland Congress Party, the Swaziland Progressive Party, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, the South West Africa People's Organization, and a nationalist organization from Angola.

Seven years ago, on March 21, the South African fascist authorities brutally suppressed a large demonstration by South African Africans against the "pass laws." The joint statement pointed out that the Sharpeville incident opened up new prospects for the Azanian people's struggle against oppression. The statement said: "Since then, the Azanian people have understood the revolutionary truth: revolutionary violence must be used to counter reactionary violence; 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'; to effectively oppose imperialism, one must resolutely oppose modern revisionism. This is the correct development of revolutionary thought. This is the significance of the Sharpeville incident."

The statement said that the Azanian people's determination to fight for freedom is embodied in their unyielding struggle against imperialism led by the United States and against the new colonialists led by Soviet modern revisionists. Under the leadership of the Pan-Africanist Congress, the Azanian people will ultimately win victory.

The joint statement said: "The Sharpeville massacre tempered the Azanian people, giving them a true revolutionary spirit to liberate their own country and rule their own country." The statement went on to emphasize: "As Chairman Mao Zedong has correctly called for: 'Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward along the path of their blood!'"

Edwin Makoti, the representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress in Cairo, said in his speech: "The Azanian people are determined to fight for their independence. They have no choice. They know that if the people do not have guns, they have no rights. They cannot defend or maintain their rights. They only have the right to be killed, as happened in Sharpeville."

Makoti expressed the Pan-Africanist Congress's support for the world people's anti-imperialist struggle, especially the struggle against the chief accomplices of imperialism—the modern revisionists. He said: "We have experienced the harm of modern revisionism in our years of struggle."

Makoti said: "We support the Chinese people in their Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to defend their revolutionary achievements in their own country."

The meeting read out messages of support from the China-Africa Solidarity Committee, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Senanayake, and the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, which were met with enthusiastic applause.

Representatives from the Zimbabwe African National Union and some African student organizations also spoke at the meeting or sent telegrams to the conference.

    在开罗的非洲自由战士就沙佩维尔事件七周年发表声明
    必须用革命的暴力对付反革命的暴力
    要反对帝国主义就必须坚决反对现代修正主义
    新华社开罗二十八日电　非洲自由战士二十七日晚在这里就阿扎尼亚沙佩维尔大屠杀事件七周年举行集会。会上，六个非洲民族主义政党和组织发表了一项联合声明，强烈谴责以美国为首的帝国主义、南非法西斯种族主义政权和美帝的头号帮凶——苏联现代修正主义者破坏非洲人民解放运动的罪行，并表示热烈支持阿扎尼亚人民争取民族解放的斗争。
    这六个政党和组织是贝专纳人民党、巴苏陀兰大会党、斯威士兰进步党、莫三鼻给革命委员会、西南非洲民族联盟和安哥拉的一个民族主义组织。
    七年前的三月二十一日，南非法西斯当局在沙佩维尔残酷镇压了南非非洲人为反对“通行证法”而举行的大示威。联合声明指出，沙佩维尔事件为阿扎尼亚人民反对压迫的实际斗争展开了新的前景。声明说：“从那时起，阿扎尼亚人民懂得了革命真理：必须用革命暴力对付反动的暴力；‘枪杆子里面出政权’；要卓有成效地反对帝国主义，就必须坚决反对现代修正主义。这是革命思想的正确发展。这就是沙佩维尔事件的意义所在。”
    声明说，阿扎尼亚人民争取自由的决心，体现在同以美国为首的帝国主义以及同以苏联现代修正主义者为首的新殖民主义辩护士进行的不屈不挠的斗争中。阿扎尼亚人民，在泛非主义者大会的领导下，最后必将赢得胜利。
    联合声明说：“沙佩维尔大屠杀事件锻炼了阿扎尼亚人民，给他们带来了真正的革命精神，来光复自己的国家，统治自己的国家。”声明接着强调指出：“正如毛泽东主席所正确号召的：‘成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！’”
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻开罗代表埃德温·马科蒂在讲话中说：“阿扎尼亚人民决心为他们的独立而斗争。他们没有选择的余地。他们懂得，人民如果没有枪杆子，就没有权利。他们就不能保卫或维护权利。他们只有被杀的权利，就象在沙佩维尔发生的那样。”
    马科蒂表示泛非主义者大会支持世界人民的反帝斗争，特别是反对帝国主义者的头号帮凶——现代修正主义者的斗争。他说：“现代修正主义的危害性，我们在历年的斗争中已经领教够了。”
    马科蒂说：“我们支持中国人民在自己国家里开展的保卫其革命成果的无产阶级文化大革命。”
    会上宣读了中国亚非团结委员会、亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和亚非新闻工作者协会书记处打来的声援电，激起了热烈的掌声。
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟和一些非洲学生组织的代表也在会上发言，或打电报给大会。
