The war criminal Johnson, who has been beaten to a standstill by the heroic Vietnamese people, held a meeting on the evening of the 18th with a large group of military and political leaders in Guam. They discussed plans to accelerate and expand the war of aggression in Vietnam. This is the third time in a little over a year that Johnson has personally left the U.S. mainland to hold such a war meeting. Recently, with the support and encouragement of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Johnson administration has been pushing forward with the "peace talks" charade while simultaneously increasing troop deployments to South Vietnam and intensifying bombing and attacks on North Vietnam, escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam to new heights. However, this counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy has been repeatedly thwarted. U.S. imperialism is now in an unprecedentedly difficult situation in Vietnam, at its wit's end and with nowhere to turn. It is under these circumstances that Johnson has once again crossed the ocean to hold a high-level decision-making meeting on the war in Vietnam at the important U.S. military base in Guam, plotting to push the war to a new and dangerous stage, in a desperate attempt to struggle in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The war cries issued by the U.S. imperialist leaders before the Guam meeting fully reveal the crazed and adventurous nature of U.S. imperialism. On the 15th, Johnson bellowed at a press conference that the U.S. is "determined to defend South Vietnam." This war criminal also claimed that more and more signs indicate that "defending" Vietnam is the key to the political and economic future of a "free Asia," and that the U.S. "will stand firm in Vietnam," thereby "contributing to the construction of a diversified and independent Asia." On the 13th, Defense Secretary McNamara raved even more crazily at a secret meeting of the House Appropriations Committee that the U.S. is now "better prepared" to deal with so-called "emergencies around the world," and that the U.S. currently possesses "great capabilities" and "can fulfill its obligations in other parts of the world."

White House Press Secretary Christian, on the 12th, further confirmed that the Guam meeting is a pure and simple war meeting when he talked about the issues to be discussed at the meeting. He revealed that the agenda includes "three main aspects": First, the "progress" of the military aspects of the war; second, methods to maintain pressure on the ground and in the air before the U.S.'s "peace" solution is realized; third, the "pacification" plan in South Vietnam.

At the same time, U.S. and other Western newspapers have been revealing that the Guam meeting will formulate a "war escalation plan," "tightening the screws of the war." It not only aims to "greatly strengthen" the war in South Vietnam under the guise of "pacification," but also to launch an unprecedented bombing campaign against North Vietnam, "formulating a complete list of means to exert pressure," so that the U.S. can "continue to execute its comprehensive strategy to its peak."

To carry out the U.S. war of aggression, it is reported that the head of the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, will give a thorough review of military operations at the meeting and will demand that the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam be increased from the current 420,000 to 600,000. At the same time, Johnson may also grant Westmoreland "special powers," similar to those enjoyed by Eisenhower and MacArthur in Europe and the Far East during World War II, giving him "absolute control over all U.S. military operations in the Vietnam War" and "special powers over the entire Southeast Asian battlefield." It is reported that Johnson is also considering the establishment of a "Southeast Asia Command" for the U.S. invading forces.

The above signs indicate that after the failure of U.S. imperialism's war and peace two-pronged strategy in Vietnam, it is now desperate, not only determined to fight to the death in Vietnam but also to intensify military adventurism in other parts of Southeast Asia, in an attempt to reverse its fate of total failure in Asia.

However, the past year has proven that the bigger the stakes U.S. imperialism places, the more disastrous its failures, the more difficulties it faces, and the closer it comes to its day of death. The measures to intensify and expand the war of aggression that Johnson is plotting at the Guam meeting will only accelerate the total failure and demise of U.S. imperialism.

### 加紧部署扩大侵越战争的新冒险计划  约翰逊召开关岛会议妄图作垂死挣扎

    加紧部署扩大侵越战争的新冒险计划
    约翰逊召开关岛会议妄图作垂死挣扎
    据新华社十九日讯　被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额的战争瘟神约翰逊，十八日晚率领一大批军政头目，离开华盛顿前往太平洋上的关岛，同侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰、美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇，及南越卖国集团头子阮高其等举行会议，部署加紧扩大侵越战争的新的冒险计划。
    这是约翰逊为了挽救侵越败局，在一年多一点的时间内第三次亲自离开美国本土召开这种战争会议。约翰逊政府最近在苏联修正主义领导集团的支持和鼓励下，一面加紧推行“和谈”骗局，一面源源增兵南越、连续扩大对越南北方的轰炸和袭击，使侵越战争疯狂“升级”。但是这种反革命的两手策略一再遭到挫败，美帝国主义在越南陷于黔驴技穷，走投无路的空前困难的境地。正是在这种情况下，约翰逊又一次远渡重洋，特意跑到美国侵越战争的重要军事基地关岛去举行讨论侵越战争问题的高级决策会议，策划把战争推进到一个新的危险的阶段，妄图在越南人民抗美救国战争的汪洋大海中进行垂死的挣扎。
    美帝国主义的头子们在关岛会议前夕发出的一片杀气腾腾的战争叫嚣，充分说明了美帝国主义的这种疯狂性和冒险性。约翰逊十五日在记者招待会上叫嚷，美国“决心保卫南越”。这个战争瘟神还说什么越来越多的迹象表明“保卫”越南是“自由亚洲”的政治和经济前途的关键，美国“在越南坚持到底”，“就可以贡献力量为建设一个多样化的和独立的亚洲奠定基石”。国防部长麦克纳马拉十三日在众院拨款委员会秘密会议上更是疯狂地叫嚷，美国在对付所谓“全世界的紧急事件”方面，已经“有了较好的准备”，美国目前掌握“很大的能力”，“可以履行在世界其他地方的义务”。
    白宫新闻秘书克里斯琴十二日在谈到关岛会议要讨论的问题时，更加证实这次会议是一次不折不扣的战争会议。他透露会议的议题包括“三大方面”：一、战争的军事方面的“进展”；二、在美国的“和平”解决办法没有实现以前，在地面和空中保持压力的方法；三、在南越的“绥靖”计划。
    与此同时，美国和其他西方报刊纷纷透露，关岛会议将要制定战争的“升级计划”，“把战争的螺丝钉进一步扭紧”。它不仅要在“绥靖”的名义下“大大加强”在越南南方的战争，而且要对越南北方“发动一个空前的轰炸行动”，“制定一整套可以施加压力的手段的清单”，使美国“继续执行的全面战略达到高潮”。
    为了推行美国的战争冒险计划，据透露，侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰在会议上将要“对军事行动作彻底的回顾”，并将要求进一步把侵越美军从目前的四十二万多人增加到六十万人。同时，约翰逊还可能授与威斯特摩兰以“特殊的权力”，就象艾森豪威尔和麦克阿瑟在第二次世界大战期间在欧洲和远东战场上享有的那种权力，使他“拥有对越南战争中的整个美国军事行动的绝对控制”和“包括整个东南亚战场的特别权力”。据报道，约翰逊还考虑要建立一个美国侵略军的“东南亚司令部”。
    上述种种迹象表明，美帝国主义在越南的战、“和”两手策略遭到失败之后，狗急跳墙，不仅要在越南拚一死命，而且要在东南亚其他地方加紧进行军事冒险，企图以此挽救它在亚洲彻底失败的命运。
    但是，一年来的事实证明，美帝国主义赌注下得越大，失败也就越惨，困难也就越多，离它死亡的日子也就越近。约翰逊在关岛会议所将要策划的加剧和扩大侵略战争的措施，只会加速美帝国主义的彻底失败和灭亡。
