On the morning of February 8, a north wind blew over the banks of Lake Dongting, and a layer of frost covered the ground. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, Third Company of a certain unit of the PLA stood in neat rows, holding up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and solemnly swore: "Seize the revolution, promote production, and resolutely complete the task of transporting fertilizer to support spring plowing." Platoon leader Huang Daying enthusiastically said, "Comrades! Today we will travel through the lake and may encounter difficulties, but we must 'make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, surmount every difficulty, and strive for victory.'"

The soldiers sang songs of Mao's quotations, and with great spirit, they boarded seven wooden boats loaded with fertilizer and set off on their journey.

The weather suddenly changed, and it began to snow. Everyone quickly used their raincoats to cover the fertilizer. After a snowstorm, the wind and rain combined, and the soldiers, rather than enduring the cold and getting wet, took off their coats to cover the fertilizer. The waves splashed into the boat, soaking their coats, and the soldiers took off their padded clothes to cover the fertilizer tightly.

Because the wind was strong and the waves were high, the bamboo poles used for rowing were blown away, and the oars broke. The boat spun in the fierce waves, and it seemed as if it would be swallowed by the raging wind and waves! At this critical moment, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon sang, "Make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, surmount every difficulty, and strive for victory," taking Chairman Mao's words as orders. They jumped into the waist-deep lake water in the freezing cold of minus three degrees, steadied the boat, and with all their might, pushed the boat forward, facing the rolling waves and howling north wind.

As night fell, there was still no sign of the shore, and the rain mixed with snow fell harder.

At this time, the soldiers had been fighting the cold in the lake water for nine hours. Platoon leader Huang Daying, who had been leading the way, could not help but feel a bit tense. Just then, the soldiers shouted in unison, "Even if we sacrifice our lives, we must protect the state's property intact!"

The soldiers turned this difficult situation into a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the best opportunity to fight against selfishness. Party cell leader Wu Zhiqun said, "Delivering these fertilizers to the front line of spring plowing is supporting socialist construction, supporting the world revolution, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The wind was strong, but not as strong as the soldiers' determination to serve the people; the waves were high, but not as high as the soldiers' revolutionary spirit; the lake was wide, but not as wide as the soldiers' hearts, which embraced seven hundred million Chinese people and three billion people around the world; was it cold? The soldiers' hearts, loyal to Chairman Mao, were always warm; were they hungry? Chairman Mao's works were their food; was it dark at night without lights? Mao Zedong Thought was their guiding light.

The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon pushed the boat forward against the wind and snow in the lake water! At eleven o'clock in the evening, six boats successively reached the shore, but one boat was lost. Platoon leader Huang Daying, at this moment, was not thinking about his own hunger, cold, and fatigue, but about the safety of the comrade who had fallen behind and the state property. He immediately returned to the lake with other comrades to search for the missing boat.

Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have no difficulties they cannot overcome. Deputy squad leader Ling Wannen and new soldier Jiang Guoqiang were left behind, alone in a boat in the lake. What should they do? They recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by any enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." Ling Wannen said, "The more difficult the situation, the more courage we must have. Our boat may be far from our comrades, but we are soldiers educated by Chairman Mao, fearing neither heaven nor earth." Jiang Guoqiang also expressed his determination, saying, "As long as there is a person, there is a boat, and there is fertilizer." The great Mao Zedong Thought increased their courage to overcome difficulties, and they stubbornly pushed the boat forward with their shoulders.

At four o'clock in the morning, they were finally discovered by the militia who had come to search for them. Ling Wannen and Jiang Guoqiang were covered in snow, but they were still pushing the boat forward. Militia member Deng Dongyun, seeing their high sense of responsibility for public property, was moved to tears. He said, "Soldiers educated by Chairman Mao are all made of steel. With such soldiers of the people, the proletarian's mountain will forever be unshakable."

    洞庭湖上的一支凯歌
    ——解放军某部战士支援春耕的故事
    杜兴旺　朝阳　范回寿
    毛主席的话就是命令
    二月八日清晨，洞庭湖畔刮起了北风，地面上铺着一层白霜。解放军某部三连四排的战士，排着整齐的队伍，举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，庄严宣誓：“抓革命，促生产，坚决完成运送化肥支援春耕的任务。”排长黄大永激昂地说：“同志们！今天要从湖中通过，可能遇到困难，但我们要‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”战士们高唱毛主席语录歌，雄赳赳气昂昂驾着七只满载化肥的木船，驶上了征途。
    天气突然变化，下起雪来了。大家急忙用自己的雨衣，把化肥盖上。一阵雪过后，风雨交加，战士们宁肯挨淋受冻，也脱下大衣盖化肥。浪拍打着船舱，浸湿了大衣，战士们又脱下棉衣把化肥盖得严严实实。
    因为风急浪大，撑船的竹竿被吹跑了，桨桩别断了，船在恶浪中团团转，眼看要被狂风恶浪吞没！在这千钧一发的时刻，四排的战士们高唱着
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，把毛主席的话当作命令，冒着零下三度的寒冷，跳下齐腰深的湖水中，稳住了船身，然后用尽全力推着船，迎着滚滚的浪涛，顶着呼号的北风奋勇前进。
    毛泽东思想指引航向
    天快黑了，还不见岸边，雨夹着雪越下越大。
    这时，战士们已在湖水中同严寒搏斗了九个小时。一直走在前面的排长黄大永不免心情有些紧张，就在这个时候，战士们发出了钢铁般的声音：“就是牺牲生命，也要保护国家财产完整无损！”
    战士们把这艰苦的处境，当作活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，当作狠斗“私”字的最好时机。党小组长吴治群说：“把这些化肥送到春耕第一线，就是支援社会主义建设，就是支援世界革命，就是捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。”
    风大，没有人民战士为人民服务的决心大；浪高，没有人民战士的革命志气高；湖宽，没有人民战士胸怀七亿中国人民和三十亿世界人民的胸怀宽；寒冷吗？人民战士忠于毛主席的心永远是热的；饥饿吗？毛主席著作就是粮食；黑夜航行没有灯光吗？毛泽东思想就是指路明灯。
    四排战士们顶风冒雪在湖水中推船前进！晚上十一点钟，有六只船先后靠岸，有一只船丢失了。排长黄大永，这时想的不是自己的饥饿、寒冷和疲劳，而是掉队的阶级兄弟和国家财产的安全，他立刻和其他同志返回湖中巡找。
    毛主席的战士最坚强
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，没有克服不了的困难。副班长岭玩枚、新战士蒋国强掉了队，单独一只船在湖中怎么办？他们背诵了毛主席的语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”岭玩枚说：“越是困难的时候，越要提高勇气。我们的船虽然离同志们远了，但我们是毛主席教育出来的战士，天不怕，地不怕。”蒋国强也表示决心说：“人在船在化肥在。”伟大的毛泽东思想增长了他们战胜困难的勇气，他们顽强地用肩膀推船前进。
    早上四点钟，他们终于被前来巡找的民兵发现了。岭玩枚和蒋国强身上已经沾满了雪，但还在一个劲地往前推船。民兵邓东云看到他们对人民财产高度负责的精神，感动得流下了热泪。他说：“毛主席教育出来的战士，个个都是硬骨头，有了这样的人民子弟兵，我们无产阶级的江山永远是铁打的。”
