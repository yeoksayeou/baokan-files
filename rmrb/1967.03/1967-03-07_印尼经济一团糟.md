Indonesia's economy is in a state of chaos. After the right-wing military coup seized power, Indonesia has kowtowed to imperialism, selling out national interests abroad and implementing fascist rule at home, devastating the national economy. Currently, industrial production in Indonesia has stalled, prices are soaring, and the broad masses of urban and rural people are increasingly falling into misery and disaster.

	Industrial Production Grinds to a Halt

Indonesia's basic and light industries have come to a standstill. Reports indicate that, except for the light bulb factory in Surabaya, all other enterprises under its jurisdiction have halted operations. The operating rate of light industries is only between 30% to 50%. In Indonesia's largest textile industrial center, Machalaya, all textile mills using hand-operated spinning machines have stopped production.

	Selling Out National Interests

During the "Confrontation with Malaysia" period, some foreign companies that were seized by the then-government are now being returned to their original owners by the right-wing military government. At the same time, the right-wing military authorities are selling Indonesia's oil resources to imperialist countries. Reports indicate that the Suharto regime has approved contracts between the state-owned oil company and foreign oil companies to exploit offshore oil under a 65-35 profit-sharing arrangement. Additionally, contracts have been approved with American, Japanese, and Canadian companies for oil exploration.

	Prices Skyrocket Overnight

On February 10, the right-wing military authorities announced drastic price increases for gasoline, transportation, electricity, and especially domestic postal services. As a result, gasoline prices skyrocketed eightfold overnight, electricity prices quadrupled, transportation fares tripled, and domestic postal rates surged nearly seventeenfold. These price hikes will cause all other prices to rise in tandem.

The right-wing military authorities have ruined the economy, making life increasingly difficult. To escape the predicament, apart from begging for "U.S. aid," they are intensifying the plunder of the people. Printing money and raising prices are key methods. Reports indicate that they are still issuing currency at a rate of nearly 20 billion rupiah per month and plan to issue new 500 rupiah and 1,000 rupiah notes.

	Refugees Flood the Cities

Due to economic collapse and soaring prices, urban residents are massively unemployed, and rural populations are flooding into cities. Now, beggars and refugees are everywhere in Indonesia's cities. Even more tragic is that the number of people dying from hunger is increasing. According to reports from Jakarta newspapers, since November of the previous year, in just ten months, over 50,000 people have starved to death on Lombok Island, which has a population of over a million. In a village of 2,000 people, 600 have starved to death.

    印尼经济一团糟
    本报讯　印尼右派军人发动政变攫取政权以后，对外屈从帝国主义，拱手出卖民族利益，对内实行法西斯统治，摧残民族经济。现在印尼工业生产停顿，物价暴涨，广大城乡人民越来越陷入了困苦和灾难之中。
        工业生产陷于停顿
    印尼的基本工业和轻工业生产，目前已经陷于停顿状态。据报道，在基本工业中，除在三宝垄的电灯泡工厂外，其所属的所有企业都停顿了。轻工业的开工率也只有百分之三十到百分之五十。在印尼最大的纺织工业中心马查拉雅，所有用手摇纺织机的纺织厂都停顿了。
      拱手出卖民族利益
    在“对抗马来西亚时期”曾被当时政府没收的一些外国公司，现正被印尼右派军人政府拱手归还原主。与此同时，右派军人当局又把印尼的石油资源出卖给帝国主义国家。据报道，苏哈托政权已批准了印尼国营石油公司与外国石油公司所签订的、根据百分之六十五对三十五的分红办法开采沿海石油的合同。另外还批准了和美国、日本和加拿大公司签订的勘探油源的合同。
        一夜之间物价暴涨
    二月十日，印尼右派军人当局宣布汽油、交通费、电费特别是国内邮费的激剧涨价。结果，汽油价格在一夜之间上涨八倍，电费上涨四倍，交通费上涨三倍，而国内邮费则暴涨近十七倍。上述涨价将使一切物价随之而上涨。
    印尼右派军人当局把经济搞得一团糟，日子越来越不好过。为了摆脱困境，除了乞求“美援”外，就是加紧掠夺人民。滥发钞票，提高物价是重要办法。据报道，现在仍以每月近二十亿盾的速度发行钞票，并将发行五百盾和一千盾的新币。
      逃荒人群充斥城市
    由于经济雕敝，物价飞涨，城市居民大量失业，农村人口又大批流入城市，现在印尼各城市到处充满着求乞和逃荒的人群。更其悲惨的是，饿死的人越来越多。据雅加达报纸报道，从前年十一月份起，十个月内，仅巴厘岛东面的龙目岛，在一百多万人口中就饿死了五万人。在一个两千人的村子里，就有六百人饿死。
