Shanxi Province has swiftly established a system of frontline command posts at the provincial, regional, and county levels to strengthen leadership over spring ploughing.

Following the publication of an article and an editorial in the People's Daily about Huairou County's experience in establishing frontline command posts for revolution and production, the core group of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi immediately issued an urgent notice to all regions, cities, and counties, as well as military sub-districts and municipal and county armed forces departments. The notice called for the widespread promotion of Huairou County's experience in industry, agriculture, and finance and trade. Within a few days, various regions established or reorganized existing revolution and production organizations into frontline command posts for revolution and production, following Huairou County's example. Now, the frontline command posts for revolution and production at the provincial, regional, and county levels have formed a new organizational system. The Shanxi Provincial Frontline Command Post for Revolution and Production has begun operations; the five regions of Xin County, Jin Dongnan, Jin Nan, Jin Zhong, and Yan Bei, as well as various counties (cities), have all formulated action plans.

The frontline command posts for revolution and production at all levels are composed according to the revolutionary "three-in-one" principle. The Shanxi Provincial Frontline Command Post for Revolution and Production is led by revolutionary leading cadres, with Yuan Zhen, a former secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, serving as the commander-in-chief. Deputy commanders include Zhao Guanying and Cao Yuqing, deputy commanders of the Shanxi Military Region, Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Party branch of the advanced agricultural unit Dazhai Production Brigade, and Liu Xiangdong, a representative of revolutionary mass organizations. The members also include Li Shunda, a national agricultural labor model. According to statistics on the composition of members of the frontline command posts for revolution and production in the five regions, revolutionary leading cadres account for 32%, military sub-district responsible cadres account for 26%, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations account for 42%.

Since their establishment, the "three-in-one" frontline command posts for revolution and production at all levels have played a significant role and have achieved initial results in strengthening leadership over spring ploughing. Revolutionary mass organizations in various places have vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," propagated the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to all poor and lower-middle peasants in rural people's communes and cadres at all levels, and the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to revolutionary workers and cadres in all factories and mines. They have armed the minds of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels with Mao Zedong Thought, and have done a good job in spring ploughing. In the previous stage, more than ten thousand cadres have been dispatched to the spring ploughing frontline across the province. Now, the frontline command posts for revolution and production in various places have dispatched nearly ten thousand more cadres to the spring ploughing frontline. Currently, the number of laborers participating in agricultural work across the province has significantly increased, and the militia organizations have played a significant role in spring ploughing. The province has already ploughed and harrowed more than 20 million mu of land to preserve moisture, accumulated more than 16 billion piculs of fertilizer, and the progress of various spring agricultural tasks has accelerated compared to the previous period.

On the 14th and 15th, some regions in Shanxi experienced a welcome rain. The Shanxi Provincial Frontline Command Post for Revolution and Production called on all regions in the province to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "seizing the opportunity to grasp the production links" and seize the opportunity after the rain to plough, harrow, and preserve moisture, and do a good job in drought resistance.

    山西建立各级第一线指挥部加强对春耕生产的领导
    派出大批干部奔赴春耕第一线
    新华社太原二十三日电　山西省已经迅速建立起省、地、县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部组织系统，加强对春耕生产的领导。
    《人民日报》发表怀柔县建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的经验和社论后，中共山西核心小组当天就向全省各地、市、县核心小组以及各军分区和市、县武装部发出紧急通知，要求工业、农业、财贸各方面普遍推广怀柔县的经验。在短短几天内，各地就参照怀柔县的经验，建立了或者将原有的抓革命促生产组织改组成了抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。现在，省、地、县的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，已经形成一套新的组织系统。山西省抓革命促生产第一线指挥部已经开始工作；忻县、晋东南、晋南、晋中、雁北五个专区和各县（市）的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，普遍制订了行动计划。
    各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，都是按照革命的“三结合”的原则组成的。山西省抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，由革命领导干部、原中共山西省委书记处书记袁振任总指挥，人民解放军山西军区副司令员赵冠英、曹玉清，全国农业先进单位大寨生产大队党支部书记陈永贵，革命群众组织代表刘向东等担任副指挥；成员中还有全国农业劳动模范李顺达。根据全省五个专区抓革命促生产第一线指挥部组成人员的统计，革命领导干部占百分之三十二，人民解放军军分区负责干部占百分之二十六，革命群众组织代表占百分之四十二。
    各级“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部一成立，就发挥出了巨大的战斗作用，并对加强春耕生产的领导取得了初步成效。各地革命群众组织大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，用毛泽东思想武装贫下中农和各级干部的头脑，搞好春耕生产。前一阶段，全省已派出一万多名干部前往春耕第一线，现在各地抓革命促生产第一线指挥部又派出了近万名干部，到春耕第一线去。目前全省农村出勤劳力显著增加，民兵组织在春耕中发挥了很大的突击作用。全省已耙耱保墒二千多万亩地，积肥十六亿多担，各项春耕农活的进度都比前一段加快。
    十四、十五两日，山西一部分地区普降喜雨。山西省抓革命促生产第一线指挥部号召全省各地遵照毛主席“不失时机地掌握生产环节”的教导，抓紧雨后良机，进行耕地耙耱保墒，做好抗旱工作。
