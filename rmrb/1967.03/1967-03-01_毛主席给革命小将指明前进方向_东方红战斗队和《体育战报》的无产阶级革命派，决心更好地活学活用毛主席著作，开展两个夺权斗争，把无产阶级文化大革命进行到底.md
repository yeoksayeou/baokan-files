Chairman Mao points the way forward for revolutionary youth. The revolutionary masses of the East Red Combat Team and the *Sports Gazette* are determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out two struggles for power, and see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

A New China News Agency Shanghai dispatch dated February 28 reports: The East Red Combat Team of the Lu Xun Brigade of the Shanghai Sports Line Revolutionary Rebel Command and the young fighters of the *Sports Gazette* are currently engaged in both struggle and rectification. Upon hearing the joyous news that *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily* had reprinted their articles and issued editorials and comments respectively, they were moved to tears of joy and spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, our heart's red sun! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They said, "This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest support, and greatest encouragement for us revolutionaries. It is also a great spur to us. Chairman Mao has shown us the way forward and the path to take. We must better 'read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.' While struggling to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we must also seize the power of the 'self' in our minds. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a better conclusion."

On the evening of the 25th, when these 16- and 17-year-old young fighters heard the news broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, they excitedly ran to tell each other the good news. This heart-stirring news inspired the young fighters, and many stayed up all night, excitedly discussing their thoughts and resolutions.

The young fighters said, "Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao cares for revolutionary youth in every detail and supports us revolutionaries the most. We are so fortunate! Today, it feels as if we are seeing Chairman Mao waving to us from Tiananmen Gate again. Hearing the comments from *Red Flag* magazine and the editorial note from the *People's Daily* is like hearing Chairman Mao's warm voice, like having Chairman Mao by our side."

The young fighters said, "Chairman Mao always points out the way forward and the revolutionary path at the most critical moments of the revolution. Now, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have begun to struggle and rectify at the same time, but we have not done enough. Chairman Mao cares for us so much, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words. While seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we must also seize the power of the 'self' in our minds. We resolutely open the door to rectification, not hiding anything, not becoming defenders of bourgeois ideology in our minds."

The editorial team of the *Sports Gazette* said, "Upon hearing this joyous news, our hearts flew to Beijing. We have not done enough in propagating Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we must strive harder to study Mao Zedong Thought, more enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, more bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to make greater contributions to the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The other brigades and combat teams of the Shanghai Sports Line Revolutionary Rebel Command were also immersed in boundless joy. Some wrote congratulatory messages to the East Red Combat Team, while others wrote big-character posters expressing their resolve to learn from the East Red Combat Team, to consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to consciously carry out rectification.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches, "Rectification is the whole Party learning Marxism through criticism and self-criticism. Through rectification, we will certainly learn more Marxism." Chairman Mao's teachings made the young fighters understand the profound significance of rectification even more and strengthened their resolve and determination to carry out rectification consciously. They said, "We resolutely do as Chairman Mao teaches, through criticism and self-criticism, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, temper ourselves to be even stronger, and grow politically even faster."

The young fighters expressed in countless words their resolve to the Party and to Chairman Mao: For the proletariat's pride, for the pride of our great socialist motherland, we will never be transient figures in history, never be fleeting phenomena. Forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!

    毛主席给革命小将指明前进方向
    东方红战斗队和《体育战报》的无产阶级革命派，决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，开展两个夺权斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社上海二十八日电　正在边战斗边整风的上海体育战线革命造反司令部鲁迅兵团东方红战斗队和《体育战报》的小将们，听到《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》转载他们写的文章并为此分别发表短评和编者按的喜讯，激动得热泪满眶，情不自禁地热情高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们说：这是毛主席对我们革命派最大的关怀，最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，也是对我们的最大鞭策。毛主席给我们指出了前进的方向和道路。我们一定要更好地“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
    二十五日晚上，当这些十六、七岁的小将听到中央人民广播电台广播这个消息的时候，大家兴奋地奔走相告，互传喜讯。这个激动人心的消息，鼓舞着小将们，许多人通夜未眠，兴奋地相互交谈自己的体会和决心。
    小将们说，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无微不至的关怀革命青少年，最最支持我们革命派。我们太幸福了！今天，我们好象又看到了毛主席他老人家在天安门上向我们招手。听到《红旗》杂志的短评和《人民日报》的编者按，就象听到了毛主席亲切的声音，就象毛主席在我们的身旁。
    小将们说：毛主席他老人家总是在革命的最关键的时刻，给我们指出前进的方向，革命的道路。现在我们遵循毛主席的教导，开始边战斗边整风，但我们做得还很不够。毛主席这样关怀我们，我们一定听毛主席的话，要在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，夺我们自己头脑里“私”字的权。我们坚决开门整风，决不遮遮掩掩，决不做自己头脑中资产阶级思想的“保皇派”。
    《体育战报》编辑组的小将们说：我们听到这个喜讯，我们的心飞到了北京。我们《体育战报》宣传毛泽东思想还很不够，我们今后一定要更加努力地学习毛泽东思想，更热情地宣传毛泽东思想，更勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，力争为伟大的无产阶级文化大革命作出更大的贡献。
    上海体育战线革命造反司令部其他各兵团、各战斗队的小将们也沉浸在无比幸福的心情中。他们有的写了喜报祝贺东方红战斗队，有的写了大字报表示坚决向东方红战斗队学习，一定要自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地整风。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“整风就是全党通过批评和自我批评来学习马克思主义。在整风中间，我们一定可以更多地学到一些马克思主义。”毛主席的教导使小将们更加懂得了整风的深远意义，更增强了自觉整风的信心和决心。他们说：我们坚决按毛主席所教导的那样去做，通过批评和自我批评，活学活用毛主席著作，把自己锻炼得更加坚强，使自己在政治上更快地成长起来。
    小将们千言万语，向党向毛主席表达了这样的一个决心：为无产阶级争气，为伟大的社会主义祖国争气，决不做历史上来去匆匆的过客，决不做昙花一现的人物，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好战士！
