Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must concern yourselves with state affairs and see the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" After achieving victory in the struggle for power, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong Province are facing a new major test. This is whether they can firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, steadfastly implement the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is an unprecedented great innovation. The fundamental purpose of this Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly uproot the roots of capitalism and revisionism in our country, to resolve the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between socialism and capitalism. The struggle for power is a decisive battle between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The victory of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the struggle for power has dealt a fatal blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has not ended. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, though defeated, are not reconciled to their fate and will inevitably join forces with the reactionary elements in society such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and with various ghosts and snakes, adopting various new forms to fight to the death with us, attempting to regain the power they have lost. If the revolutionary masses of the proletariat become complacent and slacken their vigilance because of the victory in the struggle for power, and underestimate this situation, they will commit a serious political error and face the danger of losing power.

After achieving victory in the struggle for power, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shandong Province has entered a new phase. The revolutionary torrent, guided by Chairman Mao, is rolling forward, and the situation is excellent and getting better. However, at this very moment, the handful of power-holders within the Party who were just overthrown by us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have not given up. Once they have regained their composure, they immediately join forces with various reactionary elements to launch a counter-revolutionary restoration tide. They aim to sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," attack the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and this is the new feature of their counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the new stage of the struggle for power, Chairman Mao issued a great call to us to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is a guarantee for the victory of the struggle for power and a guarantee for consolidating power. After the victory in the struggle for power, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong Province resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, encouraging more leading cadres to come forward and join the revolution. At this time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road misjudged the situation, thinking the time had come, and eagerly jumped out, deliberately distorting the correct line of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," attempting to strip it of its revolutionary soul and turn it into a hodgepodge of "two into one." They used every means to sow discord between revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary leading cadres and the People's Liberation Army, using their influence to promote conciliation and compromise, directing their accomplices to infiltrate the power organs of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Some even openly clamored to "rehabilitate" them and "restore their reputation." This is the extremely cunning and poisonous tactic adopted by the class enemy in the new situation. Their goal is to seize back the leadership they have lost, to return to power, and to impose counter-revolutionary bourgeois dictatorship on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat again.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the question of how to deal with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations is a major issue. It was so before the struggle for power, and it remains so after the struggle for power. After the victory in the struggle for power, the revolutionary mass organizations in Shandong Province, in order to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, immediately launched a rectification movement centered on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, summarizing combat experience, rectifying work styles, and enhancing combat effectiveness. This precious revolutionary initiative and creativity is excellent. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and some people with ulterior motives took this opportunity to make a big fuss, launching a counterattack against the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They distorted facts, fabricated lies, incited one group against another, and stirred up masses against masses; they maliciously smeared the faces of revolutionary pioneers, saying that one person had an "impure class background," another had "bad motives for rebellion," and another had "personal ambitions"; they used their past influence to secretly manipulate and actively revive "preservation" organizations; some even openly threatened the revolutionary mass organizations that had criticized and struggled against them, saying things like, "In the past, you struggled against me, committing a directional and line error, now it's time for me to settle accounts with you. 'You can't wait until autumn to settle accounts, you have to do it now, immediately.' and so on. In short, they are always looking for opportunities to take revenge on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, attempting to destroy the revolutionary mass organizations and suppress the great revolutionary mass movement initiated by our great leader Chairman Mao, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution come to a halt.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance." The appearance of this counter-revolutionary restoration tide is not surprising. It is determined by the objective law of class struggle and is not subject to human will. What is important is that we, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must always maintain a clear political mind, remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and understand that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, like all reactionaries, "will never lay down their butcher's knives, and they will never become Buddhas." We must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about them, but must timely expose all their tricks and engage in a head-on struggle with them.

To smash this counter-revolutionary restoration tide, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong Province, under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, are carrying out rectification while fighting, fully mobilizing the revolutionary power of the broad masses. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' initiative, letting the masses educate themselves, liberate themselves, and rise up to make revolution in the struggle, is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching. The revolutionary masses have the firmest stand, the clearest hatred and love, and are best at grasping the overall direction of the struggle. The revolutionary masses have the keenest eyes, see the movements of the class enemy most clearly, and are best at exposing the tricks of the class enemy. Facts have proven that as long as we steadfastly implement the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao and fully mobilize the broad revolutionary masses, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are attempting counter-revolutionary restoration and taking the capitalist road will be exposed in broad daylight and have nowhere to hide.

"Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." Under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong Province have conducted extensive and in-depth investigations and research. On this basis, they strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, separating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are plotting counter-revolutionary restoration and taking the capitalist road from the masses who have been deceived; they strictly distinguish the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and are fishing in troubled waters, launching counterattacks, from the leading cadres who have truly come forward to join the revolution. They firmly grasp the overall direction of the struggle and resolutely direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Relying on the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong Province have already achieved great victory in the struggle for power, and we will definitely, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary restoration tide, make the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" better, make the rectification movement within the revolutionary organizations better, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, strengthen ideological revolutionization, and successfully complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    放手发动群众，粉碎反革命复辟阴谋
    王效禹
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”山东省无产阶级革命派，在取得夺权斗争胜利之后，面临着一个新的重大考验，这就是，能不能高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是举世无双的伟大创举。这场文化大革命的根本目的，就是要在我国彻底挖掉资本主义、修正主义的根子，解决无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。夺权斗争，是在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一场决战。无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，给了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以致命的打击。但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，并没有就此结束。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，人还在，心不死，必然地要和社会上坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子和各种牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，采取种种新的形式，同我们作拚死的斗争，妄图把他们已经失去的权力再夺回去。如果无产阶级革命派因为夺权斗争的胜利而麻痹起来，松懈了警惕性，对这种形势估计不足，那就要犯绝大的政治错误，就会有失去政权的危险。
    山东省的无产阶级文化大革命，在取得夺权斗争胜利之后，出现了崭新的局面。革命的洪流，沿着毛主席指引的方向，滚滚向前，形势好得很，而且越来越好。但是，就在这个时候，一小撮刚刚被我们无产阶级革命派推翻的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，并没有死心，他们惊魂稍定，立即同各种反动势力结合起来，掀起了一股反革命的复辟逆流。破坏革命的“三结合”，打击无产阶级革命派，是他们进行反革命复辟活动的新特点。
    无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的新阶段之后，毛主席向我们发出了实行革命的“三结合”的伟大号召。革命的“三结合”，是取得夺权斗争胜利的保证，也是巩固政权的保证。为了充实和加强革命的“三结合”的阵容，在夺权胜利之后，山东省无产阶级革命派，坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，促使更多的领导干部站出来革命。这时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派错误地估计了形势，以为时机已到，便迫不及待地跳了出来，竭力歪曲革命的“三结合”的正确方针，妄图抽去它的革命灵魂，使它成为“合二而一”的大杂烩。他们千方百计挑拨革命群众组织和革命领导干部、人民解放军的关系，利用他们的影响，大搞调和主义、折中主义，指使他们的同伙，混进革命的“三结合”的权力机构。有的甚至公然叫嚣，要给他们“平反”，“恢复名誉”。这是在新形势下，阶级敌人所采取的极其阴险、极其毒辣的钻心战术。其目的，就是要夺回他们已经失去的领导权，由他们重新上台，重新对无产阶级革命派实行反革命的资产阶级专政。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，如何对待革命群众和革命群众组织的问题，是一个大是大非问题。夺权之前是这样，夺权之后仍然是这样。山东省的革命群众组织，在夺权胜利之后，为了彻底搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，立即开展了以活学活用毛主席著作为中心的整风运动，总结斗争经验，整顿思想作风，提高战斗力。这种可贵的革命的自觉性和创造性，好得很。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和某些别有用心的人，却乘机大作文章，对无产阶级革命派进行反攻倒算。他们歪曲事实，制造谎言，拉一帮打一帮，挑动群众斗群众；他们竭力往革命闯将的脸上抹黑，说那个人
  “出身成份不纯”，那个人“造反动机不良”，那个人“怀有个人野心”；他们利用过去的影响，暗中操纵，积极复活“保字号”组织；有些人甚至公然威胁曾经批判、斗争过他们的革命群众组织，说什么“过去你们斗了我，是犯了方向、路线错误，现在该是我和你们算账的时候了。”“不能等到秋后算账，现在就得算，马上兑现。”如此等等。总之，他们老是在窥测方向，寻找时机，对无产阶级革命派进行阶级报复，妄图把革命的群众组织搞垮，把我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动打下去，使无产阶级文化大革命半途而废。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”目前这股反革命复辟逆流的出现，并不奇怪，这是阶级斗争的客观规律所决定的，是不以人们的意志为转移的。重要的是，我们无产阶级革命派要始终保持清醒的政治头脑，牢记毛主席的教导，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派同一切反动派一样，他们“决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛”。我们决不能对他们抱有任何不切实际的幻想，要及时识破他们的一切阴谋诡计，同他们进行针锋相对的斗争。
    为了粉碎这股反革命复辟的逆流，山东省无产阶级革命派在省革命委员会的领导下，边整风，边战斗，充分发挥了广大群众的革命威力。相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众在斗争中，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己起来闹革命，这是毛主席的一贯教导。革命的群众，立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，最能掌握斗争的大方向。革命的群众，眼睛最亮，对阶级敌人的动向看得最清，最能识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。事实证明，只要我们坚定不移地贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把广大的革命群众充分发动起来，党内一小撮妄图进行反革命复辟的走资本主义道路的当权派，就会暴露在光天化日之下，没有藏身之地。
      “政策和策略是党的生命”。山东省无产阶级革命派，为了粉碎这股反革命复辟逆流，在省革命委员会的领导下，进行了广泛深入的调查研究。在此基础上，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，把策划反革命复辟的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和受蒙蔽的群众严格区别开来；把混水摸鱼、进行反攻倒算的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和真正站出来革命的领导干部严格区别开来。牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，坚决把斗争的矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    毛泽东思想是我们无产阶级革命派的命根子。山东省无产阶级革命派，依靠伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，已经取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利，我们也一定能够按照毛主席的教导，团结广大革命群众，彻底粉碎这股反革命复辟逆流，把革命的“三结合”搞得更好，把革命组织内部的整风运动搞得更好，破私立公，加强思想革命化，胜利地完成斗、批、改任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
