Guinean friends have warmly praised Chairman Mao and his brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. A Guinean employee recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao is the greatest and most correct Marxist-Leninist of our time. After the Soviet revisionists betrayed the world revolutionary cause, it is Chairman Mao who has raised the great red banner of opposition to imperialism and colonialism higher, and it is he who has always stood firmly on the side of the oppressed and exploited peoples of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and who most resolutely supports their liberation struggle. There is no doubt that Chairman Mao has become the most respected and beloved leader of the revolutionary peoples of all countries, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

The employee also said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the most revolutionary and correct thought. It is like the radiant sun."

A Guinean student said: "Chairman Mao is the great genius leader of the world revolution. His works are the most precious treasure of revolutionaries and are the sole guide to their actions."

He said: "Today, whoever faithfully follows the path indicated by Chairman Mao will surely achieve victory in the struggle, and whoever deviates from this correct path will surely fail. Countless past facts have proven this, and future facts will also prove this."

    几内亚朋友热情赞颂
    毛泽东思想是红光普照的太阳
    新华社科纳克里电　几内亚朋友热烈颂扬毛主席和光芒四射的毛泽东思想。一位几内亚职员最近对新华社记者说：“毛主席是当代最伟大、最正确的马克思列宁主义者。在苏联修正主义者背叛世界革命事业之后，正是毛主席更高地举起了反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的伟大红旗，正是他始终不渝地站在正在进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的各国被压迫和被剥削人民的一边，并最坚决地支持他们的解放斗争。毫无疑问，毛主席今天已成为各国革命人民，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民最尊敬和最爱戴的领袖。”
    这位职员还说：“毛泽东思想是最革命和最正确的思想，它象红光普照的太阳。”
    一位几内亚学生说：“毛主席是世界革命的天才的伟大导师。他的著作是革命者最宝贵的财富，也是指导他们行动的唯一指南。”
    他说：“今天，谁忠实地沿着毛主席指引的道路前进，就一定能在斗争中取得胜利，谁脱离这条正确的道路，就一定要失败。过去的无数事实证明了这一点，今后的事实也必将证明这一点。”
