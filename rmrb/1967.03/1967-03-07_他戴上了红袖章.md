The meeting hall erupted in enthusiastic applause. On the stage, a vigorous young man was pinning a red armband onto an elderly comrade. The elderly comrade, with graying temples, looked at the red armband on his arm, his wrinkled face beaming with excitement and pride.

He was Deputy Director of the factory, Guo Shumin.

Half a month ago, Guo Shumin had submitted an application to the revolutionary faction of the factory, expressing his desire to join the revolutionary organization. The headquarters had discussed it several times, but due to differing opinions, it was temporarily shelved. Yesterday, Old Guo, with a burning heart, submitted another written application. That evening, the headquarters held a meeting to discuss the issue of the factory-level cadre's application.

Yang Shijie, who was presiding over the meeting, had just finished reading Old Guo's application when Li Gang, known as "Big Gun," opened his mouth and poured out all the opinions he had expressed during the previous discussions:
"Our stance remains the same. Old Guo is the deputy director. Developing a 'leader' figure requires caution; otherwise, rumors might fall on our heads. Besides, we are all workers; if we let an official in, our purity will be compromised."

As soon as Li finished speaking, Old Wang chimed in: "This is a tricky issue. I think we should put it aside for now and work on unifying the front with him, letting him lead the business side."

Like salt in an oil pan, Li and Wang's speeches sparked a heated debate. Most comrades agreed to accept Old Guo, but Li and Wang still advocated putting it aside. The discussion was stuck on how to handle the "people in power."

At this moment, Old Song suddenly stood up and said:
"We must distinguish right from wrong. To be afraid of 'leader' figures just because they are leaders does not align with Chairman Mao's class analysis. We cannot be blinded by the term 'people in power'; we must first see what kind of 'people in power' they are, whether they are 'without' or 'with' capitalists. If they are part of the handful walking the capitalist road, then we have no words for them; we must resolutely fight them. If they are proletarian people in power, then they are our precious assets! When discussing Old Guo's issue, we must first see which type of 'people in power' he belongs to."

Old Song's words hit the mark, and the heated debate temporarily subsided. Everyone couldn't help but recall the events from seven or eight months ago.

When the proletarian cultural revolution began in the factory, within a few days, the walls were covered with big-character posters. A small group within the Party Committee, who were walking the capitalist road, were terrified and frightened. They sang about "internal and external differences," "maintaining secrecy," and "strengthening unity" in the Party Committee meetings, trying to silence the revolutionary cadres. At this moment, Guo Shumin stepped forward and posted a big-character poster titled "Tearing Off the Mask to Reveal the Truth," exposing the crimes of the small group within the Party Committee who were walking the capitalist road, revealing all their secrets. This revolutionary action infuriated the small group, and they organized forces to severely "deal with" Old Guo.

"I say Old Guo is on our side, supporting and speaking for us!" Old Song took a puff of his cigarette and said emotionally: "Last August, a small group within the factory who were walking the capitalist road saw us as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones. They spread rumors everywhere, slandering our revolutionary faction as a group of 'troublemakers' and 'hooligans.' At this time, Old Guo stepped forward and wrote a big-character poster: 'Singing Praises for the Hooligans.' One slanders, one praises, Old Guo is truly one of us!"

Indeed, Old Guo was truly heart-to-heart with the revolutionary faction. In every critical moment of the struggle, he stood firmly with the revolutionary faction. Remember, one night, it was very late, and everyone was discussing how to resist the economic wind when, with a clatter, Old Guo pushed open the door. He was panting and said, "I got a message. Those guys are inciting some deceived workers to try to pressure you by dropping their tools. You must hold firm! Do more mass work, and I'll handle the production matters!"

A workshop director who had joined the revolutionary organization said: "Old Guo is a good cadre who emphasizes politics. I remember once the Party Committee secretary blabbered about changing the factory's appearance by changing the environment. Old Guo immediately countered him, proposing that changing the factory's appearance should start with changing people's spiritual outlook. Changing people's spiritual outlook means vigorously promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works..."

Old worker Li Daluang sighed deeply: "Since Old Guo joined the production leadership team after the seizure of power, he has been working tirelessly, wearing an oily work uniform, day and night in the workshop. After handling matters, he picks up tools and starts working. He is the kind of leader we workers hope for. We should absorb him into the revolutionary organization and not practice exclusivism!"

As everyone was recalling Old Guo's performance during the cultural revolution, the factory's loudspeaker came on: "Comrades, pay attention, we will now broadcast the editorial from the fourth issue of 'Red Flag' magazine: 'On Correctly Handling Relations with Cadres.' Please listen carefully!"

Li jumped up and shouted: "Hey, timely help has arrived! Let's first hear what 'Red Flag' magazine has to say!"

The powerful voice echoed in the night sky, and everyone listened intently to the broadcast. After listening, they discussed it heatedly. Only Li, who usually loved to shout, sat silently, stroking his chin and pondering. "To the people in power, not making a class analysis, generally doubting, generally denying, generally excluding, and generally overthrowing them is a kind of anarchist trend." These words kept ringing in his ears. After pondering for a while, he stood up and said:
"Hey, it turns out I was missing a string of class analysis in my brain. My previous opinions were wrong. I wholeheartedly support Old Guo joining the revolutionary organization. Tomorrow, I will go and pin the red armband on him!"

Amidst the applause, everyone approved Old Guo's application.

Now, Guo Shumin, wearing the red armband, stood on the stage, facing the trusting eyes of the masses, facing the red sea of red Little Red Books and red armbands, his eyes moistened. Scenes of smoke-filled battlefields during the War of Liberation, thrilling struggle scenes from over a decade of peaceful life, and pictures of turbulent cultural revolution surged into his mind. He excitedly spoke into the megaphone, condensing his heartfelt words into one sentence: Follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life!

    他戴上了红袖章
    朝晖
    会场上响起了热烈的掌声，主席台上，一个虎虎有生气的小伙子正在给一位老同志戴袖章。这位鬓发斑白的老同志含着激动的泪花，瞅着自己臂上的红袖章，多皱的脸上流露出兴奋自豪的笑容。
    他就是这个工厂的副厂长郭树民。
    半个月前，郭树民就向厂里的革命派递了一份申请书，表达了他要求加入革命派组织的心愿。总部研究过几次，因为意见不统一，暂时搁了下来。昨天，老郭又怀着一颗火热的心，再次提出了书面申请。晚上，总部便开了个会，讨论这个厂一级干部的申请问题。
    主持会议的杨士杰刚念完老郭的申请书，炮筒子李刚便亮开嗓门，把他前几次讨论时说过的意见，一古脑儿端出来了：
    “咱还是那话，老郭是副厂长，发展‘长’字号的人物可得慎重些，闹不好流言蜚语就会落到咱们头上来。再说，咱们都是工人，放进一个当官的来，这纯洁性儿就差了。”
    小李话音刚落，老王就接上茬说：“这事儿有点棘手，我看还是撂一撂，跟他先搞搞统一战线，让他领导业务那一摊子吧！”
    象盐落在油锅里，小李和老王的发言引起了热烈的争论。大部分同志同意把老郭吸收进来，小李和老王还是主张搁一搁。讨论就拧在怎样对待“当权派”的问题上了。这时候，老宋猛地站起来说：
    “咱们可要分个青红皂白。见‘长’字号人物就不敢沾边，这不符合毛主席阶级分析的观点。咱们不能被‘当权派’三个字蒙住了，得先看看他是那一号的‘当权派’，姓‘无’还是姓‘资’的。如果是那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，那咱跟他没二话，坚决跟他斗；要是无产阶级当权派，那可是我们的宝贵财产啊！讨论老郭的问题，首先得看他是那一家子当权派。”
    老宋的话打到了点子上，热烈的争论暂时静了下来，大家不禁想起了七、八个月以前的事。
    厂里无产阶级文化大革命运动一开始，呼啦啦几天工夫就贴满了大字报。党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，怕得要死，吓得要命。他们在党委会上高唱什么“内外有别”啦，“注意保密”啦，“加强团结”啦，一个心眼要堵革命干部的嘴。就在这时候，郭树民站了出来，贴了一张《撕破画皮看内幕》的大字报，把党委内那一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，连老底都给端出来了。这一革命行动把那一小撮人触怒了，他们组织力量把老郭狠狠“整”了一通。
    “我说老郭是跟咱们站在一道，替咱们撑腰说话的！”老宋吸了一口烟，深情地说：“去年八月份，厂里一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派把咱们看作眼中钉，肉中刺，他们到处散布流言蜚语，污蔑咱们革命派是一群‘刺儿头’，‘痞子’，就在这时候，老郭站了出来，写了一张大字报：《为‘痞子’唱赞歌》。一个谩骂，一个唱赞歌，老郭真是咱自己人啊！”
    是啊，老郭跟革命派确实是心贴心的，斗争的每一关键时刻，他都坚定地跟革命派站在一起。记得一天夜已很深了，大伙正在研究如何击退经济主义黑风时，哐啷一声老郭推门进来了，他气喘吁吁地说：“我得到一个消息，那班家伙煽动一些受蒙蔽的工人，想要以撂挑子来压垮你们，你们可要顶住啊！你们多做些群众工作，生产上的事就交给我吧！”这响当当的几句话，至今大伙还记得清清楚楚。
    一个参加了革命派组织的车间主任说：“老郭是一个突出政治的好干部。记得有一次党委书记胡诌什么改变工厂的面貌得从改变环境着手，老郭当场就把他顶了回去，来了个针锋相对，提出改变工厂面貌首先得从改变人的精神面貌着手，改变人的精神面貌，就得狠抓活学活用毛主席著作……。”
    老工人李大光深有感慨地说：“自打老郭参加了夺权后的生产领导班子，那可真是豁着身子干，穿一身油污工作服，没日没夜地在车间转，事儿处理完了，摸起一把工具就干活，是咱们工人指望的那种领导干部。咱们应当吸收他参加革命派组织，可不能关门主义啊！”
    大家正在你一言我一语地回顾老郭在文化大革命中的表现时，厂里的广播喇叭响起来了：“同志们注意，马上转播《红旗》杂志第四期社论：《必须正确地对待干部》，请认真收听！”
    小李蹦了起来，嚷嚷道：“哎，雪里送炭来了，咱们先听《红旗》杂志怎么说吧！”
    宏亮的声音在夜空里回荡，大家聚精会神地听着广播。听完后热烈议论开了，只有素来爱嚷嚷的小李，一声不吭地托着腮帮在琢磨问题。“对当权派，不作阶级分析，一概怀疑，一概否定，一概排斥，一概打倒，这是一种无政府主义的思潮。”这几句话，老在他耳边回荡。考虑了半晌，他站起来说：
      “嘿，闹了半天原来咱脑子里缺一根阶级分析的弦，刚才我那些意见错了，我举双手赞成老郭加入革命派组织，明天我去给他戴红袖章！”
    在一片掌声中大家通过了老郭的申请。
    现在，郭树民戴着红袖章，站在讲台上，面对着群众信任的眼光，面对着红彤彤的语录本、红艳艳的袖章交织成的红色海洋，他的眼睛湿润了。解放战争中硝烟弥漫的场面，十几年来和平生活中惊心动魄的斗争情景，文化革命中惊涛骇浪的图画，一齐涌上他的心头。他激动地对着扩音器，把肺腑中的千言万语凝结成一句话：一辈子跟着毛主席闹革命！
