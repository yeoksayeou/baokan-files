At a critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of the proletarian revolutionary masses achieving great unity and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Heilongjiang Province have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for the PLA to actively support the leftist broad masses. They have gone deep into the important factories, warehouses, and transportation hubs of Harbin City, wholeheartedly propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, arming the proletarian revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses in seizing, holding, and using power well, and striving for revolution and production. This has been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses.

The officers and soldiers of the unit where Liu Yingjun was stationed have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting; apart from fighting to destroy the enemy's military forces, it also has to undertake major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses establish revolutionary political power, and even building Communist Party organizations." They have all expressed that they will definitely, like Liu Yingjun, become red seeds spreading Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and unite and fight with the proletarian revolutionary masses to build a new revolutionary order and safeguard the victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle for power.

Once the officers and soldiers entered the factories, enterprises, and transportation hubs, they encountered a series of new problems related to seizing and holding power. Following Chairman Mao's instruction that "all conclusions come at the end of investigating the situation, not at the beginning," they went deep into the workshops and dormitories, labored and had heart-to-heart talks with the workers, understood the ideological situation of various personnel, and grasped the main contradictions existing in these units. They then, based on the main contradictions, carried out painstaking and meticulous political and ideological work, arming the proletarian revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought and uniting and educating the intermediate masses.

After the proletarian revolutionary masses achieved initial victory in the struggle for power, some units saw the growth of anarchism, factionalism, sectarianism, and individualism to varying degrees within the revolutionary ranks, severely corroding the revolutionary spirit and weakening the fighting capacity of the revolutionary forces. How to help the revolutionary masses overcome these erroneous thoughts? The officers and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March," deeply felt that unless the "private" authority in one's mind is seized, it is impossible to truly consolidate and develop the victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle for power, and there is even the danger of losing it. The officers and soldiers discovered two revolutionary mass organizations that had united to seize all the power usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After seizing power, the two organizations had disagreements. The officers and soldiers studied the "Three Articles" and "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party" with them, conducted detailed ideological work, and the revolutionary masses raised their consciousness, unified their thoughts, strengthened their unity, and did better in revolution and production.

The officers and soldiers who came to the factories, warehouses, and transportation hubs helped the proletarian revolutionary masses solve another major problem: how to correctly handle revolutionary cadres. There, they found that some members of the revolutionary mass organizations lacked a class analysis perspective, advocating that "all those in power should step aside." Meanwhile, some of the original revolutionary leading cadres were still hesitant, not daring to "appear" before the masses and actively stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

Facing this situation, the officers and soldiers carefully studied Chairman Mao's expositions on cadre policy and relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine. They then, one by one, had heart-to-heart talks with the responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations, workers, and revolutionary cadres, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and helped everyone understand that our country is a proletarian dictatorship, fundamentally speaking, the proletariat is in power, most cadres are good, and only by correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy can we truly achieve victory in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and consolidate the victory of seizing power. Through the officers and soldiers' repeated propaganda of the Party's policies and a series of political and ideological work, the original revolutionary leading cadres who had reservations bravely stood out, stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and exposed the problems of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, creating conditions for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

After the proletarian revolutionary masses achieved victory in seizing power, they faced another major issue: how to eliminate the remnants of the reactionary economic line of the bourgeoisie, strive for revolution, promote production, strengthen labor discipline, and truly boost production. The officers and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," participated in labor on one hand and propagated Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production" policy to the broad masses of workers on the other, helping everyone understand that the good or bad of production directly affects national construction and the people's lives, as well as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Whether one supports or opposes the "grasp revolution, promote production" policy is a dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, inspiring everyone to strive to be pioneers in grasping revolution and models in promoting production.

Currently, the broad revolutionary workers in Harbin City are full of enthusiasm, striving for revolution, and promoting production.

    解放军驻哈尔滨某部广大指战员深入工厂交通运输企业
    用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派
    夺好权掌好权狠抓革命猛促生产
    据新华社哈尔滨二十二日电　在无产阶级文化大革命进入无产阶级革命派实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，人民解放军驻黑龙江省某部广大指战员，最热烈地响应毛主席发出的人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，深入到哈尔滨市重要的工厂、仓库、交通枢纽，满腔热忱地宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派，支持无产阶级革命派夺好权、掌好权、用好权，狠抓革命，猛促生产，受到广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    刘英俊生前所在部队的指战员反复学习了毛主席的教导：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”他们纷纷表示：一定要象刘英俊那样，人人做传播毛泽东思想的红色种子，用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，建设革命的新秩序，保卫无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利成果。
    指战员们一进入工厂、企业、交通枢纽，就遇到夺权、掌权的一系列新问题。他们按照毛主席关于“一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾，而不是在它的先头”的教导，深入车间、宿舍，同工人一起劳动和谈心，了解各种人员的思想情况，摸清存在于这些单位的主要矛盾，并针对主要矛盾，展开艰苦细致的政治思想工作，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派，团结、教育中间群众。
    无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争的初步胜利之后，有些单位的革命派内部滋长了不同程度的无政府主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、个人主义等错误思想，严重地腐蚀着革命队伍的斗志，削弱了革命队伍的战斗力。怎样帮助革命群众克服这些错误思想呢？指战员们遵循毛主席“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”的教导，深深体会到，不把头脑里“私”字的权夺过来，就不可能真正巩固和发展无产阶级革命派夺权胜利的成果，甚至还有丢失的危险。指战员发现有两个革命群众组织，他们联合起来夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派窃踞的一切大权。夺权胜利后，两个组织发生了意见分歧。干部战士就同他们一起学习“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，进行细致的思想工作，革命群众提高了觉悟，统一了思想，增强了团结，把革命和生产搞得更好。
    来到工厂、仓库、交通枢纽的指战员们，帮助无产阶级革命派解决的第二个主要问题是如何正确对待革命干部。在那里他们发现一些革命群众组织的成员，缺乏阶级分析的观点，主张只要是当权派就“靠边站”。而原来的一些革命领导干部，有的仍然“怕”字当头，不敢在群众面前“亮相”，主动站到无产阶级革命派一边。
    针对这种情况，指战员们认真学习了毛主席关于干部政策的论述和《红旗》杂志的有关社论。然后，分头和革命群众组织负责人、工人、革命干部个别谈心，一同学习毛主席著作，使大家认识到我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，从根本来说，当权的是无产阶级，大多数干部是好的，只有正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，才能真正取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的胜利和巩固夺权的胜利。经过指战员们反复地宣传党的政策和进行一系列的政治思想工作，原来有思想顾虑的革命领导干部，勇敢地站了出来，站到无产阶级革命派一边，并揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的问题，为革命的“三结合”创造了条件。
    无产阶级革命派在夺权胜利之后，面临着的又一个重大问题，是如何肃清资产阶级反动路线的反革命经济主义的余毒，抓革命，促生产，加强劳动纪律，真正把生产促上去。指战员们遵循毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，一面参加劳动，一面向广大职工宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，使大家认识到生产的好坏，不仅直接影响着国家的建设，人民的生活，也直接影响着无产阶级文化大革命运动。对“抓革命，促生产”的方针，是拥护，还是不拥护，还是反对，这是革命、不革命或者反革命的一个分界线，鼓舞大家争当抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。
    目前，哈尔滨市广大革命职工正在干劲冲天，狠抓革命，猛促生产。
