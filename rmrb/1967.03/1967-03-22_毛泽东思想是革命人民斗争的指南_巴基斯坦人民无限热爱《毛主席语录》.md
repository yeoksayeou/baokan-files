A bookstore in Lahore imported the first batch of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" which sold out within two days after arrival. This event clearly shows the boundless love of the Pakistani people for the works of Chairman Mao.

An employee of the bookstore said that at present, many people still want to buy this book, and many laborers who do not understand English are also requesting a Urdu version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

A friend from Lahore said: "Whenever I and my colleagues discuss various issues and quote Chairman Mao's sayings, they listen attentively, showing envious expressions, and eagerly want to read this precious book."

He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is indeed a great spiritual wealth shared by all progressive peoples in the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the source of the glorious achievements of the Chinese people, and Mao Zedong Thought is becoming the guide for the struggle of all revolutionary peoples in the world."

A worker from the Lahore Trade Union, who obtained a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Chinese friend, said that he often uses the teachings from this red book to explain issues to his colleagues. When they learned that he was inspired by "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they all wanted to get this book.

A student in Rawalpindi quoted a passage from Chairman Mao's sayings in his composition. His teacher marked it as an excellent sentence. When he told his teacher that this passage was not his own but from Chairman Mao's sayings, his teacher eagerly wanted to read this red book.

    巴基斯坦人民无限热爱《毛主席语录》
    新华社拉瓦尔品第电　拉合尔一家书店进口的第一批《毛主席语录》在运来以后的两天之内就销售一空，这件事清楚地表明巴基斯坦人民无限热爱毛主席著作。
    这家书店的售货员说，目前还有很多人要买这本书，许多不懂英文的劳动人民还要求出版乌尔都文版本的《毛主席语录》。
    拉合尔的一位朋友说：“每当我和我的同事们在讨论各种问题过程中引用毛主席语录时，他们总是聚精会神地听着，表现出羡慕的神情，并渴望阅读这本宝书。”
    他说：“毛泽东思想真正是世界一切进步人民共同的巨大精神财富。毛泽东思想是中国人民取得辉煌成就的根源，毛泽东思想正在成为世界一切革命人民进行斗争的指南。”
    一位从中国朋友那里得到了一本《毛主席语录》的拉合尔工会工作者说，他经常根据这本红书中的教导来向他的同事解释问题。当他们知道，他是从《毛主席语录》中得到启示的时候，他们全都想得到这本书。
    拉瓦尔品第的一个学生在他的作文中有一段引用了毛主席语录。他的老师把它作为佳句标出来。当他告诉他的老师，这段话不是他写的，而是毛主席的语录时，他的老师非常渴望读到这本红书。
