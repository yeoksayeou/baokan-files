Two Million Patriots in Okinawa Clash with Police

On the morning of February 24, approximately 2,000 teachers, workers, and students in Okinawa, Japan, surrounded the Legislative Assembly and held a demonstration. They were protesting against a bill proposed by the U.S. military occupation authorities and their collaborators to persecute patriotic teachers. The reactionary authorities in Okinawa deployed over 900 armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators, injuring many. The savage actions of the reactionaries infuriated the patriotic people of Okinawa, who gathered more than 20,000 strong and surrounded the armed police, engaging in fierce combat. They broke through the police lines guarding the Legislative Assembly.

Fearing the power of the masses, the Chairman of the Legislative Assembly, Nagamine Akio, was forced to announce the withdrawal of the reactionary bill. The demonstrators achieved a complete victory.
