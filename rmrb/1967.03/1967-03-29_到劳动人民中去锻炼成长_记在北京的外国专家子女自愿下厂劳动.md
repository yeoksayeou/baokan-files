In February, the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory was in full swing with the revolution and production. A group of foreign children, the oldest being sixteen or seventeen, the youngest thirteen or fourteen, came to the bustling workshop. They labored alongside Chinese workers, tempering themselves and transforming their thoughts through labor.

Who are they? They are all children of foreign experts working in Beijing. Their parents come from Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, Colombia, Chile, the United States, and Britain.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shook the hearts of these foreign children. Their parents organized the "Mao Zedong Thought Rebel Corps White-Seen-Yan'an," and they organized the "Mao Zedong Thought Youth Rebel Corps White-Seen-Yan'an." One child said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that we cannot just be verbal revolutionaries; we must also stand on the side of the revolutionary people in action and become complete revolutionaries. At this great historical moment, we organize ourselves to better learn Mao Zedong Thought and participate in the Cultural Revolution."

Chairman Mao said, "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? There is only one standard: whether they are willing and able to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants."

These children understand that a revolutionary youth cannot grow in a greenhouse; they must go among the working people to temper and grow, and must, as Chairman Mao teaches, unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Thus, they voluntarily came to the factory, united with the workers, ate, lived, and labored together, learned from the workers, and tempered themselves through labor.

Most of them are students from various middle schools or primary schools in Beijing, and it is almost their first time in a factory. They are not afraid of dirt or hard work; they eagerly take on tasks. After completing one task, they immediately ask, "Master, what's next?" Sweeping the floor, wiping the workbench, cleaning the lathe, washing parts, getting their hands oily and their bodies covered in dust—none of it matters. A child named Li Zhigang said, "Getting a little oil on your hands is nothing; what matters is keeping your thoughts pure." The masters unanimously praised them: "Lili is very responsible." "Simina is very down-to-earth." "Chuchuka does whatever is asked of her." "Honggang pays attention to discipline." "Marko is eager to study technology" ...

After participating in labor, these children have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings that revolutionary youth must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Someone asked the thirteen-year-old Simina, "Is labor good?" She immediately replied, "Yes! In labor, you can learn many good things from the workers. Workers teach us how to apply Chairman Mao's works actively, how to overcome difficulties." Kurianto added, "In labor, we realize that workers work wholeheartedly to build the country and support the world revolution."

In labor, these children encountered many difficulties and problems. However, they were able to apply Chairman Mao's works actively. Each of them carried a bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and whenever they encountered difficulties or problems, they would open this treasure book. Chairman Mao's words illuminated their thoughts, and with the masters' patient and specific help, they overcame difficulties and solved problems.

They are still children, sometimes working only out of interest. Initially, they found the workshop very novel and worked well for the first week, but the second week, their performance was slightly worse. Some liked one type of work but not another. To address these issues, they studied the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," conducted criticism and self-criticism, and improved their sense of responsibility and discipline. Later, Marko said, "After studying the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' it felt like Chairman Mao was criticizing us. Our mistakes in thought are because we have read Chairman Mao's books too little."

One day, before the end of the shift, Kurianto casually wiped the lathe and washed his hands, preparing to leave. However, he noticed that everyone else's lathe was wiped clean. At that moment, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on being extremely responsible in work, so he carefully wiped the lathe again before leaving the workshop.

There are many such examples of actively applying Chairman Mao's works, with the most outstanding being Lili's example.

Before coming to the factory, Lili was not well-prepared. She did not expect the lathe to be so large and the speed so high. On the first day, she stood in front of the lathe, seeing it rotate at 1,200 revolutions per minute, and the iron chips flying out like short dragon whiskers, almost hitting her face. At that moment, she was a bit scared, fearing the iron chips would hurt her. Additionally, working eight hours a day standing up was very tiring. Later, she had to work the night shift. This series of problems confronted her. Thus, a strong thought arose in Lili's mind: it would be best to change machines and jobs.

The master, Ran, who helped Lili with her work, noticed Lili's mental fluctuations. Coincidentally, she fell ill at that time. Master Ran, on one hand, called a doctor to treat her, and on the other, found her to have a heart-to-heart talk. Master Ran talked to Lili about her past: "Before liberation, I worked in this factory. At that time, I was even younger than you, only eleven years old. I worked twelve hours a day, and I had to walk thirty miles to and from work. There were many difficulties. Could I not work? No! If I did not work, I would not have food to eat. Even if I worked, I still could not eat my fill or dress warmly. Now, compared to the past, it is truly a world of difference!" From the past, Master Ran talked about the revolution. She said to Lili, "Your country's present and our country's past are the same. Your parents are not asking you and your brother to study well in China and do the revolution after returning home? Revolution requires revolutionary feelings, requires unity with workers and peasants, and requires the revolutionary feelings of the working people. Do not be afraid of difficulties. This bit of difficulty and danger in labor is nothing. Revolution is more difficult, with the danger of being beheaded! Should we not revolutionize because of danger?" Master Ran also encouraged her to study Chairman Mao's works well, improve her thoughts, overcome difficulties, and finally said to her, "Overcoming difficulties in labor is also revolutionizing!"

Lili was very inspired by Master Ran's words and thanked her from the bottom of her heart for her enthusiastic help. After Master Ran left, she opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with questions in mind and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's words: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. Only then are we good comrades." She read over and over again, "Resolve to struggle, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." After Lili repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, her mind became clear. She thought: if I cannot overcome this bit of difficulty, how can I do the revolution? Thus, she firmed up her resolve, decided not to change the lathe or the day shift. Later, she worked very well.

In the matter of actively applying Chairman Mao's works, Lili has deep feelings. She said, "To revolutionize, one must definitely study Chairman Mao's works. Now, people all over the world are studying Chairman Mao's works. Because they know that only by truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought can one do the revolution well."

A month of labor tempering ended, and these children developed deep feelings for the factory, this great revolutionary crucible. When it was time to leave, many children felt they had gained a lot in this month, their thoughts had improved, and they were reluctant to leave. Andria presented her feelings by giving the portraits of Chairman Mao, as well as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, to the revolutionary comrades in the workshop. Now, these children have returned to school. They will, together with their Chinese classmates, resume classes and make the revolution.

    到劳动人民中去锻炼成长
    ——记在北京的外国专家子女自愿下厂劳动
    二月里，北京第二机床厂正在热火朝天地抓革命、促生产，一群外国孩子，大的十六七岁，小的十三四岁，来到沸腾的车间里，同中国工人一起劳动，在劳动中锻炼自己，改造自己的思想。
    他们是谁？——都是在北京工作的外国专家的子女。他们的父母来自日本、印尼、南非、哥伦比亚、智利、美国、英国。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命震动了这些外国孩子们的心灵。他们的父母组织了“毛泽东思想造反团白求恩—延安”，他们也组织了“毛泽东思想青年造反团白求恩—延安”。一个孩子说：“毛主席教导我们，不能只做一个口头革命派，要在行动上也站在革命人民方面，做一个完全的革命派。在这个伟大的历史时刻，我们组织起来，是为了更好地学习毛泽东思想，参加文化大革命。”
    毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”
    这些孩子们懂得，一个革命的青年，不能在温室里成长，一定要到劳动人民中去锻炼成长，一定要象毛主席教导的那样，和广大的工农群众结合在一块。
    于是，他们自愿地来到了工厂，同工人结合，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，向工人学习，在劳动中锻炼。
    他们大部分都是北京各初中或高小的学生，差不多都是头一次下工厂。他们不怕脏，不怕累，有活儿抢着干。有的干完一件马上就问：“师傅，还干什么？”扫地，抹工作案子，擦车床，洗零件，弄得两手是油，一身是灰，也没有什么。一个名叫李志强的孩子说：“手上弄点油没关系，思想上可不能脏。”师傅们异口同声地夸奖他们：“李黎，很负责。”“西米娜，很踏实。”“楚楚卡，叫干什么干什么。”“红刚，很注意纪律。”“马尔科，肯钻研技术。”……
    参加了劳动之后，这些孩子们对毛主席的教导，革命的青年要和广大工农群众结合在一块，体会得更深刻了。有人问十三岁的西米娜：“劳动好不好？”她马上回答说：“好！在劳动中可以从工人那里学到很多好的东西。工人教我们怎么活学活用毛主席著作，克服困难。”库里安托接着说：“我们在劳动中认识到工人全心全意地干活儿，为了建设祖国，也为了支援世界革命。”
    在劳动中，这些孩子们碰到不少的困难和问题。可是，他们能够活学活用毛主席著作。他们每人身边都带着一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，遇到了困难，遇到了问题，就打开这本宝书，毛主席的话把他们的思想照亮了，再加上师傅们耐心地具体地帮助，于是，困难克服了，问题也解决了。
    到底还是孩子，有时候只凭兴趣干活儿。初到车间，很新鲜，第一个星期干得很好，第二个星期就稍微差一点儿了。还有的人喜欢干这种活儿，不喜欢干那种活儿。针对这些活思想，他们学习了《毛主席语录》，展开了批评和自我批评，提高了对工作的责任心和纪律性。事后，马尔科说：“学了《毛主席语录》，好象毛主席在批评我们。我们思想上有错误，就是因为毛主席的书读得太少了。”
    有一天，下班前，库里安托把车床马马虎虎地擦了擦，洗了手，就准备走了。可是，他发现别人的车床都擦得很干净。这时候，他想到了毛主席关于对工作要极端负责任的教导，于是，他把车床又认真地擦了一遍，然后才离开车间。
    这样活学活用毛主席著作的事例很多，其中最突出的还是李黎的例子。
    来工厂以前李黎的思想准备是不够的。她没有想到，车床这么大，转速这么高。第一天，她站在车床面前，看到车床以每分钟一千二百转的转速飞旋着，而且看到切削带出来的铁屑，象一条条短龙须一样，一下子就飞到自己的面前，快碰到了脸上。这时候，她有点儿害怕了，怕铁屑碰伤了自己。再加上一天工作八小时，都是站着，累得很。后来，又要上夜班。这一连串的问题摆在她的面前。于是，在李黎的思想上就产生了一个强烈的念头：最好能换换机床，换换工作。
    帮助李黎劳动的冉师傅看出来李黎思想上有些波动。可巧，这时候她又病了。冉师傅一面请大夫给她看病，一面去找她谈谈心。冉师傅向李黎谈起了自己的过去：“解放前，我来这个工厂做工，那时候我比你还小呢，才十一岁。每天做工十二个钟头，上下班还要来回走三十里路。困难多着呢。不干成不成？不成！不干没有饭吃。就是干了也还吃不饱，穿不暖呢。现在比过去，真是天地之别啊！”从过去又谈到了革命。冉师傅对李黎说：“你们国家的现在和我们国家的过去是一样的。你的父母不是要求你和你的哥哥在中国好好学习，回国后干革命吗？革命，就要有革命的感情，就要同工农结合，要有劳动人民的革命感情。在困难面前不要害怕。劳动中这点儿困难和危险算什么？革命更困难，有被砍头的危险！危险，难道就不革命了吗？”冉师傅又鼓励她好好学习毛主席著作，提高思想，克服困难，最后又对她说：“克服劳动中的困难，也就是闹革命啊！”
    李黎听了冉师傅的一番话，很有启发，她从内心感谢冉师傅对她的热情帮助。冉师傅走了以后，她带着问题翻开《毛主席语录》，反复地学习了毛主席的这段话：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”接着，她一遍又一遍地诵读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”当李黎反复学习了毛主席的这些教导之后，她的思想上豁然开朗了。她想：如果连这点儿困难都克服不了，还怎么能干革命呢？于是，她坚定了信心，决心不换车床了，也不换白班了。后来她一直工作得很好。
    在活学活用毛主席著作这个问题上，李黎是深有体会的。她说：“要革命，就一定要学习毛主席著作。现在，全世界人民都在学习毛主席著作。因为他们知道，只有把毛泽东思想真正学到手，才能干好革命。”
    一个月的劳动锻炼结束了，这些孩子对工厂这个革命的大熔炉都产生了深厚的感情。临走的时候，很多孩子都觉得在这一个月里收获很大，思想提高了，舍不得离开。安得利亚为了表示自己的心意，把毛主席的绣像，以及马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的绣像送给车间的革命同志。现在，这些孩子们已经回到学校里去了。他们要同中国同学们一起，复课闹革命。
