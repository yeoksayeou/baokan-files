	“Chairman Mao’s words are all truths. Every word of Chairman Mao strikes a chord in the hearts of workers.”
	“Studying Chairman Mao’s Quotations makes one’s heart bright and clear, and provides a definite direction for progress.”
	“Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, one feels an immense power…”

	These are the feelings of a young Japanese female worker named Uemura from Kyoto who studies and applies Chairman Mao’s Quotations.

	Study Every Day, Study with Questions in Mind

	Uemura lives in Osaka and commutes to Kyoto for work every morning, a journey that takes forty minutes. She uses this time to study Chairman Mao’s Quotations. She studies with questions in mind, applies what she learns, and has made significant progress.

	Last year, she saw how Japanese revisionists maliciously obstructed and sabotaged the Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival, disrupted the performances of the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe and the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe in Japan, and sabotaged the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, as well as the exhibition of the China Economic and Trade Exhibition in Kitakyushu and Nagoya. She studied Chairman Mao’s Quotations with these issues in mind.

	Distinguishing Between Enemies and Friends

	Chairman Mao said: “Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of revolution’s primary importance. … To ensure our revolution does not go astray and will definitely succeed, we must pay attention to uniting our true friends to attack our true enemies.”

	She repeatedly studied this passage, distinguishing between enemies and friends, and identifying true friends from false ones. Later, during the House of Representatives elections and the Japan-China friendship movement, she clearly saw that those who only shouted “Japan-China friendship” were the ones who fiercely opposed China and deceived the masses to win votes, the “parliamentary illusionists.” Their revisionist faces were increasingly exposed. A large amount of evidence proved that they had degenerated into the true enemies of the Japan-China friendship movement.

	Uemura, after studying Chairman Mao’s Quotations, saw things more clearly and resolutely stood on the side of the orthodox Japan-China friendship organization, engaging in the struggle against the enemies who sabotaged the Japan-China friendship movement.

	Uemura excitedly pointed to Chairman Mao’s Quotations and said: “This precious book is indispensable. It has become the guide for all my actions.”

	Rely on the Masses, Engage in Struggle

	Chairman Mao said: “The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history.”

	When she studied this passage, she deeply felt that relying on the masses is essential for effective struggle. From then on, in the Japan-China friendship movement, she particularly paid attention to uniting the active elements in the union and consulted with them on matters. Now, she pays great attention to mass work. Besides working hours, most of her energy is spent with the masses opposing the control of revisionists over the union.

	Uemura is now diligently studying the “Three Articles.”

	Friends who know her well all say that Uemura, after studying Chairman Mao’s Quotations, has become more energetic and intelligent.

### 毛主席的话句句说到我们心坎上——记一位日本青年女工活学活用《毛主席语录》的故事

    毛主席的话句句说到我们心坎上
    ——记一位日本青年女工活学活用《毛主席语录》的故事
    “毛主席的话，句句是真理。毛主席的话，每一句都说到我们工人的心坎上。”
    “学习毛主席语录，心里格外亮堂，前进有了明确的方向。”
    “用毛泽东思想武装起来，就感到有无比的力量……。”
    这是日本京都一位名叫上村的青年女工活学活用《毛主席语录》的感受。
    天天学，带着问题学
    上村住在大阪，每天早晨要乘电车到京都上工，路上需要四十分钟。她把这段时间固定为学习《毛主席语录》的时间。她带着问题学，活学活用，学习得很有成绩。
    去年，她看到了日本的修正主义分子恶劣地阻挠和破坏日中青年友好大联欢，破坏中国天津歌舞团和北京歌舞团的访日演出，破坏第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，破坏中国经济贸易展览会在北九州和名古屋的展出等等。她就带着这些问题学习了《毛主席语录》。
    分清敌我界限，辨明真假朋友
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。……我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”
    她反复学了这一段语录，分清了敌我界限，辨明了真假朋友。后来，在众议院的选举以及日中友好运动中，她清楚地看到：那些只在口头上叫嚷
    “日中友好”的家伙，正是疯狂反华、骗取群众选票的“议会迷”。他们的修正主义面目暴露的越来越清楚了。大量事实证明，他们已经堕落成为日中友好运动的真正的敌人。
    上村学习了《毛主席语录》，更加擦亮了眼睛，毅然站在正统的日中友好组织一边，同破坏日中友好运动的敌人展开了斗争。
    上村非常兴奋地指着《毛主席语录》说：“这本宝书一刻也离不开手了。它已经成为指导我每一个行动的指南了。”
    依靠群众，进行斗争
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    当她学这一段语录时，深刻地体会到必须依靠群众才能有效地进行斗争。从此，她在日中友好运动中，特别注意团结工会中的积极分子，遇事同他们一道商量。现在，她非常注意做群众工作，每天除了工作时间以外，大部分精力都用在同群众一起反对修正主义者对工会的控制。
    上村现在正在努力学习“老三篇”。
    熟悉她的朋友都说，上村学习了《毛主席语录》变得更加精力充沛，聪明能干了。
