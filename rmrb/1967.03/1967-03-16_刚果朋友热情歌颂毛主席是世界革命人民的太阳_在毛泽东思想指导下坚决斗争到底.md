Congolese friends who have visited the memorial sites of Chairman Mao's early revolutionary activities—Hunan First Normal School and Qing Shui Tang—have expressed their deepest feelings and warmly praised the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Members of the Congo (Brazzaville) Red Cross delegation, after visiting Hunan First Normal School and Qing Shui Tang, said emotionally: "Thanks to Mao Zedong Thought, the world's anti-imperialist united front has been increasingly developed, and the liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have achieved greater and greater victories. We wish Mao Zedong Thought to spread all over the world to liberate the peoples of various countries oppressed by international imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism. We wish the Chinese people and all revolutionaries of the world to carry out Mao Zedong Thought in all their work and build a new world of socialist society."

Congo (Brazzaville) National Assembly President Muabi Andre George said, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the sun of all progressive humanity in the world."

Congo (Brazzaville) Friendship Delegation to China leader Kousakana Prosper said he bought three portraits of Chairman Mao in China, planning to hang one in his office, one at home, and one in the meeting room, so that everyone can see Chairman Mao.

Mbasie Moba, editor-in-chief of the visiting Congo (Brazzaville) "New Force" newspaper, visited the well where Chairman Mao used to take cold showers to train his body and will for the revolution every day. He drew a bucket of water and washed his face, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Henry Bangi, a broadcaster from "Voice of the Congo Revolution" radio station, filled a bottle with "water used by Chairman Mao," placed it on his head, and sang and danced. Then he took this bottle of water back to his country as a souvenir.

A Congolese (Leopoldville) friend, after visiting the two places where Chairman Mao conducted his early revolutionary activities, said excitedly: "Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the Chinese revolution but also guides the world revolution, especially the armed struggle against U.S. and Belgian imperialism and their lackeys that the Congolese (Leopoldville) people have been waging for the past three years. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the highest directive for the Chinese people but also the highest directive for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is the directive that all oppressed peoples should follow. The Congolese (Leopoldville) people are determined to fight to the end under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought."

The people of Congo (Brazzaville) praise Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.

    刚果朋友热情歌颂毛主席是世界革命人民的太阳
    在毛泽东思想指导下坚决斗争到底
    新华社长沙十四日电  曾经访问过毛主席早期从事革命活动的纪念地——湖南省第一师范学校和清水塘的刚果（布）和刚果（利）朋友，怀着最真挚的感情，热烈歌颂世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    刚果（布）红十字会代表团的成员参观湖南省第一师范学校和清水塘以后感慨地说：“多亏有了毛泽东思想，世界反帝统一战线才日益得到发展，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的解放运动才得到越来越大的胜利。我们祝愿毛泽东思想传播到全世界，去解放以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义压迫下的各国人民。祝愿中国人民和全世界革命者把毛泽东思想贯彻到各项工作中去，建设一个美好的社会主义社会的新世界。”
    刚果（布）国民议会议长穆亚比·安德烈·乔治说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界进步人类的太阳。”
    刚果（布）友好访华代表团团长库萨卡纳·普罗斯佩尔说，他来中国买了三个毛主席像，准备一个挂在办公室里，一个挂在家里，一个挂在会议室里，让大家都能看到毛主席。
    来访的刚果（布）《新生力量》报主编姆巴西·莫巴参观毛主席当年在第一师范学校为革命而锻炼身体和意志，天天坚持洗冷水浴的水井时，打了一桶水用手捧起来洗脸，边洗边呼：“毛主席万岁！”一同参观的“刚果革命之声”电台广播员亨利·邦吉特意装了一瓶“毛主席用过的水”，顶在头上边唱边舞，然后他把这瓶水带回祖国，留作纪念。
    刚果（利）一位朋友参观了毛主席早期进行革命活动的这两个地方以后激动地说：“毛泽东思想不仅指导着中国革命，而且指导着世界革命，尤其指导着三年来一直处于反对美、比帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争中的刚果
  （利）人民。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的最高指示，而且也是亚、非、拉人民的最高指示。是所有被压迫人民应当遵循的。刚果（利）人民决心在毛泽东思想指导下坚决斗争到底。”（附图片）
