    Albanian Newspaper Exposes U.S.-Soviet Conspiracy in Disarmament Conference to "Prevent Nuclear Proliferation"
    U.S. and Soviet Union Intensifying Collusion to Counter China

    According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" recently published a commentary exposing that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are intensifying their conspiracy to conclude a "non-proliferation treaty" at the Geneva disarmament conference.

    The commentary states that the plot to conclude this treaty is a new link in the global collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States. They attempt, through such a treaty, to shackle the hands of the peoples of various countries, perpetually maintaining the nuclear monopoly of the two superpowers, and forcing the peoples of various countries to submit to their will. They attempt, through such a deceptive treaty, to direct their main strike force jointly against China, the powerful defender of the world revolution, and to continue actively pushing forward their conspiracies against the people of Vietnam.

    The commentary points out that while the Soviet revisionists are engaging in "disarmament" deals with U.S. imperialism, the U.S. imperialists are continuing to expand their aggression in Vietnam. With the support of the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, they are using every means to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and are expanding and strengthening the "encirclement" of China.

    The commentary exposes that the Khrushchev revisionists even shamelessly declared at the Geneva conference that the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam "in no way hinders the conclusion of new agreements." This clearly exposes their traitorous true colors.

    阿报揭露美苏在裁军会议策划“防止核扩散”阴谋
    美苏正在加紧勾结共同反华
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》最近发表评论，揭露美帝国主义和苏联修正主义正在日内瓦“裁军会议”上加紧策划缔结“防止核扩散条约”的大阴谋。
    评论说，策划缔结这一条约是苏美全球勾结中的新的一环，它们妄图通过这样一个条约束缚各国人民的手脚，永远保持两大国的核垄断，强迫各国人民屈从它们的意旨；它们妄图用这样一种欺骗性的条约，把它们的主要打击力量共同指向世界革命的强大保卫者中国，妄图继续积极推行它们反对越南人民的阴谋。
    评论指出，就在苏修同美帝大搞“裁军”交易的时候，美帝国主义者正在越南继续扩大侵略，他们在勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团的支持下，千方百计地迫使越南人民屈膝投降，并且扩大和加强对中国的“包围圈”。
    评论揭露说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在日内瓦会议上甚至恬不知耻地公开宣称，美帝国主义在越南的侵略战争“丝毫不妨碍达成新的协议”。这就清楚地暴露了他们的叛徒真面目。
