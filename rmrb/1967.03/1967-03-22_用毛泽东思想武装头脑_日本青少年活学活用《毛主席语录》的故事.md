In Japan, an increasing number of young people are actively using Mao Zedong Thought to equip their minds. They are enthusiastically studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, engaging in struggles against Japanese revisionist elements.

**The Growth of "Red Star" in Struggle**

Recently, a mimeographed magazine titled "Red Star" was published in a high school in Tokyo. The cover features a quotation from Chairman Mao: "The world is yours, also ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people, full of vigor and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." After "Red Star" was published, students eagerly passed it around. Chairman Mao's words ignited revolutionary fervor in the hearts of these young people. Some students said, "We should be like the Red Guards in China, caring about national affairs and the future of our people, becoming brave revolutionaries." A student who initiated the publication of "Red Star" said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp ideological weapon to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. We must study it well to equip our minds, and we must also let all our classmates study Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we are determined to continue publishing 'Red Star' magazine."

In their persistent study of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they pay attention to linking theory with practice, gradually seeing through the true nature of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Japanese revisionist elements.

A student who published "Red Star" magazine spoke to a Chinese reporter about his experiences in this phase of the struggle, saying, "Chairman Mao told us, 'The people, only the people, are the motive force in the making of world history.' This sentence boosted our courage to struggle. At first, we thought we were in the minority, but once the struggle began, we found that many classmates supported us, and the majority of students were dissatisfied with the oppressive measures of the school's reactionary authorities."

The name "Red Star" expresses the Japanese youth's boundless admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and their sincere devotion to the revolutionary cause of the Japanese proletariat. "Red Star" is growing and being tempered in the struggle.

**Unfazed by Pressure, Propagating Truth**

In a high school library in Shimoniwa, there is a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that many students come to read every day. This was donated to the library by a student. This young man has been reading Chairman Mao's works since two years ago and is an avid listener of Beijing Radio. He said, "Chairman Mao is not only the teacher of the Chinese people but also the teacher of the Japanese people. As long as the people of the world equip themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, they will be invincible."

Last December 9, in front of a meeting venue in Shimoniwa City, he distributed leaflets welcoming the Chinese Women's Delegation. At this moment, a revisionist jumped out and prevented him from distributing the leaflets, viciously insulting him as a "pro-Japanese" and "splittist." However, he fearlessly refuted him and firmly drove the revisionist back. At the same time, he quoted Chairman Mao's words and presented facts, patiently propagating the truth to the masses. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of first importance in the revolution.' We must distinguish between friends and enemies and resolutely struggle against the enemies who sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship." The masses supported his actions after hearing this.

This young man introduced the situation of this struggle to a Chinese reporter, saying, "At that time, the revisionist was very fierce, but I was not afraid at all because I remembered Chairman Mao's words: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers.'"

    用毛泽东思想武装头脑
    日本青少年活学活用《毛主席语录》的故事
    在日本，越来越多的青少年积极用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑。他们积极活学活用毛主席著作，同日共修正主义分子进行斗争。
    《红星》在斗争中成长
    不久前，东京一所高级中学里出版了一种油印的杂志——《红星》。封面上印着毛主席语录：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”《红星》出版以后，学生们争相传阅，毛主席的语录，字字都象颗火种，在这些年轻人的心灵上点燃起革命的热情。有的学生说，我们应当象中国的红卫兵一样，关心国家大事，关心民族的前途，做一个勇敢的革命者。倡议创办《红星》的一位同学说，毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义、修正主义、反动派的锐利的思想武器。我们自己要好好学习，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，也要让所有的同学都好好学习毛泽东思想。因此我们决心继续出版《红星》杂志。
    他们在坚持学习《毛主席语录》中，注意联系实际斗争，逐渐看清了美日反动派和日本修正主义分子的真面目。
    办《红星》杂志的这位同学向中国记者谈到这一阶段斗争的体会时说，毛主席告诉我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这句话鼓舞了我们斗争的勇气。开始我们以为我们是少数，可是斗争一展开，就发现许多同学支持我们，大多数同学对学校反动当局的迫害表示不满。
    《红星》这一名字，表现了日本青年对伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬仰，也表现了他们对日本无产阶级革命事业的热诚。《红星》正在斗争中锻炼成长。
    不怕压力  宣传真理
    在下关一所高级中学的图书馆里，放着一册红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，每天都有很多学生前来争相阅读。这是这个学校的一个学生主动地送给图书馆的。这位少年从两年前就开始阅读毛主席著作，而且是北京广播的热心听众。他说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的导师，也是日本人民的导师。全世界人民只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，就将所向无敌”。
    去年十二月九日在下关市一个集会的会场前，他向参加会的人散发欢迎中国妇女代表团的传单。这时跳出来一个修正主义分子不让他散发，并且恶毒地谩骂他是“事大主义”、“分裂主义”。但是他毫无惧色，据理反驳，坚决把这个修正主义分子顶了回去。同时，他引用毛主席语录，摆出事实，耐心地向群众宣传真理。他说，毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们应当看清朋友和敌人，向破坏日中友好的敌人坚决斗争。群众听了都支持他的行动。
    这位少年向中国记者介绍这次斗争情况时说，当时，修正主义分子虽然很凶，但是我一点也不怕，因为我记住了毛主席的话：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”
