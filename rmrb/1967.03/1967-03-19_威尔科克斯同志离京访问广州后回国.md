The New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Comrade Wilcock left Beijing for a visit to Guangzhou and then returned to his country.

Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Kang Sheng and others went to Beijing Airport to see him off.

Comrade Wilcock, while meeting revolutionary masses in Guangzhou, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, pointing out that the mass movement of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the latest development of Mao Zedong Thought, and the most correct form. To carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must have the army, must have the state apparatus of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and must have the support of the masses.

New China News Agency, March 18th: New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Comrade Wilcock left Beijing for Guangzhou on the 14th to visit and inspect, and left Guangzhou for his country on the 16th.

When Comrade Wilcock left Beijing on the 14th, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Kang Sheng, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Comrade Liu Ningyi, and alternate member of the CPC Central Committee Comrade Zhao Yimin, along with hundreds of representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, and New Zealand comrades in Beijing, went to the airport to see him off.

At the airport in the capital, the crowd shouted, "Warmly send off Comrade Wilcock!" "Long live the combat friendship between the Chinese Communist Party and the New Zealand Communist Party!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" Everyone waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and enthusiastically saw Comrade Wilcock off.

Comrade Wilcock, while meeting revolutionary masses in Guangzhou, enthusiastically praised the brilliant leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, pointing out that the mass movement of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the latest development of Mao Zedong Thought, and the most correct form.

During his stay in Guangzhou, Comrade Wilcock visited the Martyrs' Cemetery of the Guangzhou Commune Uprising and laid a wreath at the martyrs' tomb. On the wreath, he wrote: "On behalf of all members of the New Zealand Communist Party, I present this wreath to the heroic revolutionary fighters of the Guangzhou Commune who sacrificed their lives in the early days of the Chinese revolution for freedom and socialism. Today, the Cultural Revolution led by the inspiration and guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, with the participation of young Red Guards and revolutionary rebels, is developing, thus realizing the ideals and goals of the early heroes who were massacred by the reactionary Kuomintang. The road indicated by Chairman Mao is the road to socialism. Revisionism and bourgeois ideology have been defeated, and socialist China is becoming stronger and stronger. This guarantees that China, together with Marxist-Leninists of all countries, will certainly defeat imperialism led by the United States and its running dogs—the modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party. The leadership of the Soviet Communist Party is a traitor to proletarian internationalism. The heroic martyrs of the Guangzhou Commune Uprising will live forever! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the young Red Guards! Long live the great leader of all Marxist-Leninists, Mao Zedong! Long live proletarian internationalism!"

On the evening of the 15th, Comrade Wilcock, accompanied by responsible comrades Chen De and Deng Xiufang of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, met with soldiers of the Liberation Army and received revolutionary masses who came to express their firm support for the Chinese People's Liberation Army's participation in the Cultural Revolution and the promotion of the revolution's "three-in-one combination." Comrade Wilcock saw the revolutionary masses holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with quotations from Chairman Mao, shouting slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Salute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" He was moved and repeatedly waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to the revolutionary masses.

Comrade Wilcock said to Comrade Chen De, "This scene is magnificent. I have never seen such a scene before. This is a concrete manifestation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a new development in your Cultural Revolution. This mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the latest development of Mao Zedong Thought, the most correct form, and something that does not exist elsewhere in the world."

Comrade Wilcock also said, "To carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must have the army, must have the state apparatus of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and must have the support of the masses, and you have all these." He emphasized, "Without Mao Zedong Thought, without Chairman Mao personally leading the Cultural Revolution, it would be impossible to carry out the mass movement."

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat came in an endless stream, and some revolutionary representatives presented Comrade Wilcock with red armbands from revolutionary mass organizations and expressed their respect for the glorious New Zealand Communist Party. Comrade Wilcock warmly thanked the revolutionary masses. As he was about to leave, he raised "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and said excitedly, "By doing as Chairman Mao says, victory is certain!" (with photo)

When Comrade Wilcock left Beijing, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, and hundreds of revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital went to the airport to see him off warmly.

    周恩来同志康生同志等到北京机场欢送
    威尔科克斯同志在广州会见革命群众时，热烈称颂毛主席的英明领导，指出中国无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，是毛泽东思想最新的发展，是最正确的形式。搞无产阶级文化大革命，必须有军队，必须有无产阶级专政的国家机器，必须有人民群众的拥护。
    新华社十八日讯　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯同志十四日离开北京到广州参观访问，十六日离开广州回国。
    威尔科克斯同志在十四日离开北京时，中共中央政治局常委周恩来、康生，中共中央书记处书记刘宁一，中共中央候补委员赵毅敏等同志，首都无产阶级革命派代表数百人，以及在北京的新西兰同志到机场欢送。
    在首都机场上，欢送的群众高呼：“热烈欢送威尔科克斯同志！”“中国共产党和新西兰共产党的战斗友谊万岁！”“战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”大家挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情地为威尔科克斯同志送行。
    威尔科克斯同志在广州会见革命群众时，热烈称颂伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，指出中国无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，是毛泽东思想最新的发展，是最正确的形式。
    威尔科克斯同志在广州期间，参观了广州公社起义烈士陵园，并向烈士陵墓献花圈。他在花圈上题词：“我谨代表新西兰共产党全体党员，向在中国革命前期为争取自由和社会主义而牺牲的广州公社英雄的光荣起义的革命战士敬献花圈。今天，毛泽东思想所鼓舞和领导的青年红卫兵和革命造反派参加的文化大革命正在发展，从而使早期被国民党反动派残杀的英雄们的理想和目标开花结果。毛主席所指引的道路是社会主义的道路。修正主义和资产阶级思潮已被打败，社会主义的中国日益强大。这就保证了中国和各国马克思列宁主义者一起，必将击败以美国为首的帝国主义及其帮凶——以苏共领导为首的现代修正主义。苏共领导是无产阶级国际主义的叛徒。英雄的广州公社起义的殉难烈士们永垂不朽！中国共产党万岁！年轻的红卫兵万岁！所有马克思列宁主义者的伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！无产阶级国际主义万岁！”
    威尔科克斯同志在十五日晚，还由中国人民解放军广东省军区负责人陈德、邓秀芳等同志陪同，和解放军战士一起，接待了前来表示坚决拥护中国人民解放军参加文化大革命，促进革命的“三结合”的无产阶级革命派队伍。威尔科克斯同志看到高举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌的革命群众高呼：“毛主席万岁”、“向中国人民解放军致敬”等口号，他激动地不断挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向革命群众致意。
    威尔科克斯同志对陈德同志说：“这个场面很雄伟，我从来没有见过这样的场面。这是无产阶级专政的具体表现，这是你们文化大革命的一个新发展。这场无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，是毛泽东思想最新的发展，最正确的形式，是世界上别的地方所没有的。”
    威尔科克斯同志还说：“搞无产阶级文化大革命，必须有军队，必须有无产阶级专政的国家机器，必须有人民群众的拥护，这些你们都有了。”他强调说：“如果没有毛泽东思想，如果不是毛主席亲自领导文化大革命，搞群众运动是不可能的。”
    无产阶级革命派的队伍川流不息地接踵而来，有的革命派代表向威尔科克斯同志赠送了革命群众组织的红袖章，并向威尔科克斯同志表达了对光荣的新西兰共产党的敬意。威尔科克斯同志向革命群众热情地表示感谢。他在最后离开时，举起《毛主席语录》激动地说：“按照毛主席的话去做，就一定能取得胜利！”（附图片）
