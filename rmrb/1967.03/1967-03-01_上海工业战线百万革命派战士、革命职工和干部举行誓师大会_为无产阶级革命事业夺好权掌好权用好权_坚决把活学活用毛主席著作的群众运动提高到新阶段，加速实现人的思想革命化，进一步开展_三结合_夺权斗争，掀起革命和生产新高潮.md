Highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible, the million revolutionary soldiers of the proletariat, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres on the industrial front of Shanghai, who bravely won the dual victories of revolution and production in the "January Revolution" storm, held the "Rally to Highly Raise the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Further Develop the 'Three-in-One Combination' Struggle for Power, Seize the Revolution, and Promote Production" today. They solemnly pledged to the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao: At this crucial moment of the great decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, they will resolutely raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieve new levels of study and application, create new situations, and accelerate the realization of the thought revolution of the people; resolutely implement the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, implement the "three-in-one combination," and seize, hold, and use power well for the cause of the proletarian revolution, quickly establish and consolidate the new order of the proletarian revolution; resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," further launch a new high tide of revolution and production, and achieve even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

Today, in Shanghai, the oldest industrial base in our country, more than 15,000 representatives of proletarian revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical cadres, and revolutionary leading cadres from various industrial fronts gathered in the city center's Cultural Revolution Square. The people were full of vigor and high spirits, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Shanghai working class daring to change the sky and the earth, and fully demonstrating the firm confidence of the proletarian revolutionaries in winning dual victories in revolution and production.

The attendees, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," read aloud with revolutionary enthusiasm:

"The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental changes in the social and economic system."

"We not only know how to destroy an old world, but we will also know how to build a new world."

"The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, avoiding problems is not the solution, but actively solving them, any human difficulty can be overcome."

"With determination, fearlessness of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, strive for victory."

The meeting began with the solemn music of "The East Is Red."

The leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the responsible persons of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters first reported to all the representatives present a piece of heartening good news: The draft resolution of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee on "The Current Situation and Tasks of the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai" has been broadcast nationwide. This is Chairman Mao's most powerful support, most intimate care, and greatest encouragement to the proletarian revolutionaries and people of Shanghai at this critical moment. At this time, the entire venue was filled with joy, and the most enthusiastic cheers erupted: "Resolutely carry out the draft resolution of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee!" "Follow Chairman Mao's words and strictly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions!" "Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'seize the revolution and promote production'!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand years to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao!"

The meeting passed a telegram of respect to our heart's most red sun, Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionaries on the Shanghai industrial front joyfully reported to Chairman Mao in the telegram: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," they broke through numerous difficulties and won new victories in Shanghai's industrial production. In January, the total industrial output value increased by 10.7% compared to the same period last year; in February, they continued to advance and completed and overfulfilled the production plans for major products. Now, the new order of the proletarian revolution in Shanghai has been quickly established, industrial production is thriving, and a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production has arrived. When the telegram was read at the meeting, the venue once again resonated with cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, ten thousand years!"

The meeting also passed a letter to all workers in Shanghai, calling on all revolutionary workers in the city to: 1. Implement the "three-in-one combination," and carry out the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to the end; 2. Be bold and take on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production; 3. Resolutely implement the Party's policies and model the observance of state laws; 4. Stay vigilant and further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat; 5. Highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and better study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Vice Chairman of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and leader of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee Zhang Chunqiao, member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and leader of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee Yao Wenyuan, and other leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee attended the meeting today.

Yao Wenyuan spoke at the meeting. Yao Wenyuan said that he learned a lot from the speeches of the revolutionary worker representatives at the meeting and saw the great power and wisdom of Chairman Mao's thoughts among the workers in Shanghai. Yao Wenyuan said that the experiences introduced by the representatives of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries can be summarized as follows: In the cultural revolution of factories and enterprises, one must highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various erroneous thoughts that go against Mao Zedong Thought, implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," vigorously seize the revolution, and vigorously promote production.

Yao Wenyuan emphasized that at any time, revolution must be in command of production. Revolution is the soul, the commander, and the driving force. Implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" has always been a struggle between two lines. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road first used "promoting production" to suppress the revolution, and later used disrupting production to disrupt the revolution. The struggle between the two lines will appear in other forms in the future. After we proletarian revolutionaries seize power, we must continue to put the revolution in the first place and push the cultural revolution forward. Only by seizing the revolution, breaking down the "self" in our minds, and establishing the "public," and planting the roots of Mao Zedong Thought, can we promote the thought revolution of the people, and production can also be carried out well. At the same time, we must be bold and fearless, with a great revolutionary spirit, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the revolutionary masses, and the power of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." With actual actions and achievements in promoting production, we will support the revolution, consolidate the achievements of the revolution, eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, and make greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction in the country.

Yao Wenyuan finally said that we must follow Chairman Mao's words and advance along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will definitely overcome any difficulties, definitely achieve dual victories in revolution and production, and definitely build factories and enterprises, and the entire Shanghai into a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

This meeting was held at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai has entered a new historical stage. The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai, while achieving victory in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have also scored victories on the economic front, with triumphant songs and frequent reports of victories. The proletarian revolutionaries on the Shanghai industrial front enthusiastically hailed that these great victories and this good situation are the victories of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," the victories of the proletarian revolutionaries implementing the great unity and developing the "three-in-one combination" struggle for power, the victories of smashing the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Ten thousand victories, a hundred thousand victories, ultimately are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In the struggle for power through great unity, the proletarian revolutionaries on the Shanghai industrial front have accumulated many valuable experiences by acting according to Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies and guidelines. Many factories and enterprises have adopted temporary power organs composed of revolutionary cadres (leading cadres, general cadres, technical personnel), worker representatives (old workers, young workers), and militia representatives in the "three-in-one combination." Some industrial departments have also established proletarian class forces in the form of combining vertical and horizontal structures according to industries, systems, units, and regions. Many factories and enterprises' proletarian revolutionaries, after seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have kept the characteristics of the working class. They have insisted on being at the forefront of production, working and discussing with the revolutionary masses, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works while solving problems, thus solving some problems in revolution and production in a timely manner. The representatives of the proletarian revolutionary organizations of Shanghai No. 8 Radio Factory, the second converter workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Shanghai Minhang Power Plant, Aimin Candy Factory, Xinxin Machinery Factory, and the Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry System, who have achieved brilliant victories on the two fronts of revolution and production, introduced their experiences in implementing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, developing the "three-in-one combination" struggle for power, correctly implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and quickly establishing and consolidating the new order of the proletarian revolution at today's meeting. They were warmly welcomed by the proletarian revolutionary soldiers on various fronts.

Today, many factories and enterprises in the city listened to and watched the live broadcast of the meeting through radio and television. Many factories' proletarian revolutionary organizations sent batches of large red congratulatory letters and letters of determination to the meeting venue with drums and gongs. The proletarian revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary technical cadres, and revolutionary leading cadres on the Shanghai industrial front most strongly expressed their determination to highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end:

"Chairman Mao, you taught us, 'All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power.' We will resolutely act according to your teachings, implement the great unity and develop the 'three-in-one combination' struggle for power; resolutely implement your cadre policy and complete the battle task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

"Chairman Mao, you taught us to 'seize the revolution and promote production.' We will resolutely implement this policy, better unite the revolutionary masses, mobilize all positive factors, firmly guard the production posts, strengthen labor discipline, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, boldly take on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production; resolutely respond to your call to 'thrift revolution,' practice thrift, and oppose waste; carry forward the communist spirit of cooperation from the overall situation, and produce more, faster, better, and more economically."

"Thousands of rules, the first rule is to raise high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought; thousands of busyness, the busyness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works cannot be forgotten. We will forever highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, while seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, seize the power of the 'self' in our minds. Break down the 'self,' establish the 'public,' sweep away sectarianism, guildism, and splitism, rectify the organization, rectify the thoughts, rectify the style, and build the proletarian revolutionary forces into a highly proletarianized, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready red army."

"Spring breeze and willows ten thousand, six hundred million people all become Yao and Shun." The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai are determined to advance with the "January Revolution" wind in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shakes the five continents, and achieve new victories on the two fronts of revolution and production.

    上海工业战线百万革命派战士、革命职工和干部举行誓师大会
    为无产阶级革命事业夺好权掌好权用好权
    坚决把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新阶段，加速实现人的思想革命化，进一步开展“三结合”夺权斗争，掀起革命和生产新高潮
    新华社上海二十八日电　高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“一月革命”风暴中英勇地夺得了革命和生产双胜利的上海工业战线百万无产阶级革命派战士、革命职工、革命干部，今天举行了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步开展‘三结合’夺权斗争，抓革命，促生产誓师大会”，向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：在当前无产阶级与资产阶级大决战的关键时刻，坚决把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，学出新水平，用出新水平，开创新局面，加速实现人的思想革命化；坚决实行无产阶级革命派大联合，实行“三结合”，为无产阶级革命事业夺好权，掌好权，用好权，迅速建立和巩固无产阶级革命新秩序；坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，进一步掀起革命和生产的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的更伟大的新胜利。
    今天，在上海这个我国最老的工业基地，来自各条工业战线的一万五千多名无产阶级革命派工人、革命技术干部和革命领导干部的代表，从全市各个工业区，浩浩荡荡地汇集到市中心的文化革命广场。人们意气风发，斗志昂扬，充分显示出上海工人阶级敢教日月换新天的英勇气概，充分显示出无产阶级革命派夺取革命和生产双胜利的坚定信心。
    出席大会的人们，手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，满怀革命的壮志豪情，齐声朗读：
    “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
    “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”
    “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”
    “社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    大会在庄严的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。
    上海市革命委员会领导成员、上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人，首先向全体到会代表报告了一个鼓舞人心的大喜讯：上海市革命委员会的《当前上海文化大革命的形势和任务》决议草案已向全国广播。这是毛主席又一次在关键时刻对上海无产阶级革命派和上海人民的最有力的支持，最亲切的关怀和最巨大的鼓舞。这时，全场万众欢腾，迸发出最最热烈的欢呼：“坚决执行上海市革命委员会的决议草案！”“听毛主席的话，不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示！”“坚决响应毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大号召！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    大会通过了给我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的致敬电。上海工业战线的无产阶级革命派满心喜悦地在致敬电中向毛主席报告：在毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，他们冲破了重重困难，夺得了上海工业生产的新胜利，一月份全部工业总产值比去年同期增长了百分之十点七；二月份又乘胜前进，完成和超额完成了主要产品的生产计划。现在，上海的无产阶级革命新秩序已经迅速建立起来，工业生产蒸蒸日上，一个抓革命，促生产的新高潮已经到来。当致敬电在大会上宣读时，全场再次响起了“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。
    大会还通过了告上海全市职工书，号召全市革命职工做到：一，实行“三结合”，把向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争进行到底；二，敢字当头，挑起革命、生产两副重担；三，坚决执行党的政策，模范遵守国家法令；四，提高警惕，进一步加强无产阶级专政；五，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作。
    中央文革小组副组长、上海市革命委员会领导成员张春桥，中央文革小组成员、上海市革命委员会领导成员姚文元，以及上海市革命委员会其他领导成员，出席了今天的大会。
    姚文元同志在大会上讲了话。姚文元同志说，他从会上革命工人代表的发言中学到了很多东西，看到了毛主席的思想在上海工人中产生的伟大力量和智慧。姚文元同志说，上海无产阶级革命派代表所介绍的经验，归结到一点，就是工厂企业搞文化大革命，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，不断用毛泽东思想克服各种违背毛泽东思想的错误思想，实行革命的“三结合”，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    姚文元同志强调指出，无论何时，都应以革命统帅生产。革命是灵魂，是统帅，是动力。贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，自始至终存在着两条路线的斗争，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，开始用“抓生产”来压制革命，后来又用破坏生产来破坏革命。两条路线的斗争今后还会以别的形式出现。我们无产阶级革命派夺权以后，必须继续把革命放在第一位，把文化大革命推向前进，只有抓好革命，在我们头脑里大破“私”字，大立“公”字，扎下毛泽东思想的根子，才能促进人的思想革命化，生产也才能搞好。同时，我们也应敢字当头，以大无畏的革命精神，充分发挥革命群众的积极性、创造性，发挥革命的“三结合”的力量，用努力搞好生产的实际行动和实际成绩，来支持革命，巩固革命的成果，肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，对全国的无产阶级文化大革命，对全国社会主义建设事业，作出更大贡献。
    姚文元同志最后说，我们一定要听毛主席的话，沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线前进。我们一定能够克服任何困难，一定能夺取革命和生产的双丰收，一定能把工厂企业，把全上海建设成为活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    这次大会是在上海无产阶级文化大革命进入到一个新的历史阶段时召开的。上海的无产阶级革命派在取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争胜利的同时，经济战线上也凯歌高奏，捷报频传。上海工业战线无产阶级革命派最最热烈地欢呼，这些巨大胜利的取得，这个大好局面的出现，是毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利，是无产阶级革命派实行大联合开展“三结合”夺权斗争的胜利，是粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。千胜利，万胜利，归根结底是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    上海工业战线无产阶级革命派在大联合夺权斗争中，按照毛泽东思想办事，按照党的方针政策办事，积累了不少宝贵的经验。许多工厂企业采用了由革命干部（领导干部、一般干部、技术人员）、工人代表（老工人、青年工人）和民兵代表组成的“三结合”临时权力机构。有的工业部门还按产业、按系统、按单位、按地区，采用了条条与块块相结合的方式，建立无产阶级的阶级队伍。许多工厂企业的无产阶级革命派，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权以后，革命造反派组织的许多负责人保持工人阶级的本色，坚持在生产第一线，和革命群众一起劳动，一起商量，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，使革命和生产中的一些问题得到及时解决。在革命、生产两条战线上取得辉煌胜利的上海无线电八厂、上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉车间、上海闵行发电厂、爱民糖果厂、新新机器厂和上海市仪表电讯工业系统等无产阶级革命派组织的代表，在今天大会上介绍了实行无产阶级革命派大联合，开展“三结合”夺权斗争，正确贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，迅速建立和巩固无产阶级革命新秩序的经验，受到各条战线无产阶级革命派战士的热烈欢迎。
    今天，全市许多工厂企业的职工，通过广播和电视，收听和收看了大会的实况。不少工厂的无产阶级革命派组织，敲锣打鼓，把大批大红的祝贺信和决心书送到了大会会场。上海工业战线上的无产阶级革命派战士、革命的技术干部和革命的领导干部，最最强烈地表达了更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强决心：
      “毛主席，您教导我们，‘世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。’我们要坚决按照您的教导办事，实行大联合开展“三结合”夺权斗争；坚决执行您的干部政策，胜利地完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务。”
      “毛主席，您教导我们，要‘抓革命，促生产’，我们坚决贯彻这一方针，更好的团结革命群众，调动各方面的积极因素，坚守生产岗位，加强劳动纪律，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，勇挑革命、生产两副重担；坚决响应您提出的‘要节约闹革命’的伟大号召，厉行节约，反对浪费；发扬从全局出发的共产主义协作风格，把生产搞得更多、更快、更好、更省。”
      “千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅第一条；千忙万忙，活学活用毛主席著作不能忘。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，夺自己头脑里‘私’字的权。大破‘私’字，大立公字，横扫小团体主义、行会主义、分裂主义，整顿组织，整顿思想，整顿作风，把无产阶级革命派队伍建设成为一支非常无产阶级化，非常革命化，非常战斗化的红色大军。”
      “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”上海无产阶级革命派决心在这震荡五洲的无产阶级文化大革命中，乘“一月革命”的东风继续前进，在革命和生产两条战线上夺取新的胜利。
