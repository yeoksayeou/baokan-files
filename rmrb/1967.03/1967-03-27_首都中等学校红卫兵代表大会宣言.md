The winds of the East are sweeping, and the red flags are flying. We, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, bathed in the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, are filled with revolutionary fervor and determination. From the great birthplace of the Red Guards movement—Beijing—we solemnly declare to the entire country and the world: the Capital Middle Schools Red Guards Representative Conference (Middle Schools Red Guards Conference) has been born in glory at this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive battle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads!

This is the great unity and alliance of tens of thousands of revolutionary rebels from the middle schools in the capital. The convening of the Middle Schools Red Guards Conference is the result of the warm care of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee. It marks the beginning of a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the middle schools of the capital.

The great Red Guards movement originated from the cradle of Mao Zedong Thought. It is the inevitable product of a new stage in the socialist revolution in our country and a great innovation in the international communist movement of the 1960s!

The great Red Guards movement has gone through a glorious and heroic journey. When it first appeared on the eastern horizon, it was our eternal red sun, Chairman Mao, with the great spirit of a proletarian revolutionary, who keenly discovered this budding force brimming with vitality. He resolutely cut off the black hands of the bourgeois reactionary line that attempted to strangle the Red Guards in their cradle. It was Chairman Mao who highly praised and firmly supported the daring revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards. It was Chairman Mao and his closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, who repeatedly received tens of thousands of Red Guards, urging them to brave the storms and waves and gain experience. The boundless care of the great leader Chairman Mao, the powerful voice of the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time, like thunder, in a short time, the sparks of the Red Guards spread like wildfire across the country and illuminated the world.

From the day of its birth, the Red Guards have sworn to be the most loyal little red soldiers of Chairman Mao, loving, believing, worshipping, and being loyal to Chairman Mao without limit.

From the day of its birth, the Red Guards have stood at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hoisting high the banner of revolution. On their bright red flag, they have inscribed in golden letters the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism boil down to one: 'Rebellion is justified.'"

Once the Red Guards stepped onto the stage of political struggle, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the full support of the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the workers, peasants, and soldiers—they, with unparalleled heroism, "marched" out of the school gates and into society. They thoroughly smashed the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, established the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, and launched a thorough struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and all the ghosts and monsters. They swept away the old world, leaving it in ruins. The Red Guards dispersed the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, smashed the counter-revolutionary encirclement, defeated their repeated frenzied counterattacks, and won one glorious victory after another.

Under the nurturing of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought and in the midst of class struggle, the Red Guards have braved the storms and waves, becoming the daring pioneers of the Mao Zedong era who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to rebel. The Red Guards are indeed a precious political shock force in the new stage of the socialist revolution; the Red Guards have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have written an immortal chapter in the history of the international proletarian revolution.

Guided by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the Red Guards have weathered countless storms and rapids, breaking through numerous obstacles, and have now entered a new stage of struggle. Today, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we are more closely united and allied!

We have established a new type of revolutionary organizational structure—the Capital Middle Schools Red Guards Representative Conference. This is the highest authority of the middle school Red Guards. During the intervals between the conferences, a committee will be set up as a standing body to handle daily affairs.

Our supreme commander is our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Our guiding ideology is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

We are the strongest reserve force of the People's Liberation Army of China.

Our organizational principle is democratic centralism.

The main body of our Red Guards consists of revolutionary students from the families of the working people (workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and other laborers). Those from non-working-class families who have deep feelings for Chairman Mao, possess a proletarian revolutionary spirit, and have consistently shown good political and ideological performance can also join.

Our ironclad battle cry of the proletarian revolutionaries is: Rebellion is justified!

The fundamental task before us is to remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We must unconditionally implement the program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally formulated by Chairman Mao—the Sixteen Points, fully rely on the masses, launch mass movements, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and not stop until we achieve complete victory!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the cunning plots of revenge by the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position." After several months of arduous struggle, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved great victories and is still advancing from victory to victory. The broad masses of revolutionaries have been roused; the bourgeois reactionary line has been reduced to a state of encirclement on all sides and total defeat. What lies before us is a bright and excellent situation. However, "the enemy will not be eliminated by itself." We clearly see that the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been completely eradicated, its social base has not been destroyed, the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists have not been thoroughly overthrown, and the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and reform has not been completed. Various signs indicate that a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration has emerged. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are still alive and kicking, still stubbornly resisting, responding to the ghosts and monsters in society, counterattacking the revolutionary masses, and attempting to negate the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like Emperor Xiang Yu." The proletarian revolutionaries must unite and repel the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, strike down the counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration, thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize and expose the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Now, Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "resume classes and make revolution," expecting us to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in middle schools through to the end. For many years, the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party have stubbornly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in schools, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Middle schools are an important stronghold where they struggle with the proletariat for the younger generation. "The school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The leader's instructions are the highest directives to us. We must immediately return to school, seize the positions occupied by the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois elements, overthrow, smash, and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionists, break the shackles of the revisionist educational line, smash the net of the old educational system, create a new world of proletarian education, turn our schools into strong fortresses for cultivating successors to communism, and firmly plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the middle schools!

Chairman Mao says: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. The word "power" concentrates the entire class struggle in socialist society. We Red Guards warriors will fearlessly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely rebel against the bourgeoisie, overthrow the heavens of the exploiting classes, and firmly seize power for the proletariat, firmly grasp the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture in the hands of the proletariat.

To seize power, we must implement the great alliance of the revolutionary masses. Otherwise, seizing power will be an empty slogan. "The urgent mass alliance, we should actively carry out!" Currently, achieving a great alliance based on teaching classes is a good form. It is beneficial to the in-depth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, beneficial to the thorough criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, and beneficial to the thorough completion of the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and reform in schools. We Red Guards must play a model and leading role in achieving this alliance, continuously strengthen the leftist forces, develop the revolutionary class ranks, and contribute to the great alliance of the revolutionary masses.

To seize power, we must firmly implement the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" proposed by Chairman Mao. This is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the struggle to seize power. The temporary power organ of the middle school revolution is composed of revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army. It must be revolutionary, representative, and have proletarian authority. Some people distort the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," practice centrism, conciliationism, and the merging of two into one, attempting to muddy the waters and fish in troubled waters, and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. This is absolutely not allowed. All Red Guards and all revolutionary masses must expose and resolutely oppose this.

Implementing the teaching of Marx that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat ultimately be liberated is the great strategic thought of Chairman Mao. The class line of the Party personally formulated by Chairman Mao is to distinguish between friends and enemies, firmly rely on the leftists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and thoroughly isolate and strike down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the extremely reactionary rightists. Whether or not one is willing and truly gradually implement the alliance of more than 95% of the cadres and masses is the touchstone for testing whether one implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or pushes the bourgeois reactionary line. For those cadres, teachers, and students who have made mistakes, we must implement the Party's traditional policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," wholeheartedly arouse their consciousness, and welcome them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Even those who have made serious mistakes should be given the opportunity to reform and redeem themselves according to Chairman Mao's instructions, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist and insist on not changing or are incorrigible. The reactionary "bloodline theory" and the anarchist trend of excluding everything, opposing everything, and overthrowing everything, as well as the tendency of exclusivism, must be thoroughly settled and resolutely overthrown!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to overthrow the "self" and establish the "public." Currently, this revolution is more broadly and deeply touching people's souls. Overthrowing the power of the "self" and overthrowing the rule of the "self" has become the key to the deepening of the movement. Vice Chairman Lin Biao points out: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution." Every Red Guards warrior must open up a battlefield to eliminate bourgeois ideas and promote proletarian ideas in the depths of their souls, thoroughly overthrow the "self" and firmly establish the "public," and achieve the revolutionization of thought. Currently, it is especially important to deeply study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," "Order of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Reissuing of the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention," "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," and "The Working Methods of the Party Committee," with the spirit of "seizing the day," grasp the transformation of worldview, follow the broad path indicated by Chairman Mao for intellectuals to integrate with the workers and peasants, and establish a completely, thoroughly people-serving worldview in the storms and waves. Red Guards warriors must overcome bourgeois ideological tendencies such as careerism, factionalism, anarchism, ultra-democratism, and individualism in the rectification, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, strictly demand of themselves with the five conditions for successors proposed by Chairman Mao, and cultivate themselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, ensuring that our socialist iron fortress will never change color for thousands of years.

The People's Liberation Army is a highly proletarianized and highly combatant revolutionary army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao. We must, like the People's Liberation Army, highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people, and turn our Red Guards organization into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism and the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat. We deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of the revolutionary people and the lifeblood of the Red Guards. With Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon, we can defeat all enemies and overcome all difficulties and carry the revolution through to the end! This decisive battle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads is the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice. Let us actively respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. Study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, and forever be good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao.

"The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are in the prime of your lives, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you.... The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you."

Red Guards warriors, comrades! Our great leader is calling, and our revolutionary elders are expecting. Let us, with unwavering confidence, welcome greater battles!

"We are not only good at destroying an old world; we will also be good at building a new world." We will personally bury imperialism, and we will announce the complete failure of the imperialists' and revisionists' dream of "peaceful evolution" in our generation. We are determined, together with the people of the whole country, to build our motherland into a great socialist power; together with the revolutionary people of the whole world, to create a new world of brilliant red Mao Zedong Thought!

Red Guards warriors, comrades, we are the future of the motherland, and we are the hope of the world. The red flag we hold high, the higher we hold it, the brighter it shines; the revolutionary song we sing, the louder we sing, the more resonant it becomes. Let us, in the revolutionary storm, advance with victory, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought all over the globe!

Long live the heroic Red Guards!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!

    首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会宣言
    新华社二十六日讯　首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会宣言，全文如下：
    东风浩荡，红旗飘扬，我们，毛主席的红卫兵，沐浴着毛泽东思想的万道霞光，满怀革命的壮志豪情，从伟大红卫兵运动的发源地——北京，向全中国、全世界庄严宣告：首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会（中学红代会）在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，光荣诞生了！
    这是首都中等学校数十万革命造反派的大联合，大团结，大会师。中学红代会的召开，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和中央文革小组亲切关怀的结果。她标志着首都中等学校无产阶级文化大革命走上了新的战斗里程。
    伟大的红卫兵运动发源于毛泽东思想的故乡，她是我国社会主义革命新阶段的必然产物，是二十世纪六十年代国际共产主义运动的伟大创举！
    伟大的红卫兵运动走过了光辉的战斗历程。当她刚刚从东方地平线上出现的时候，是我们心中永远不落的红太阳毛主席，以伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄，敏锐地发现了这一蕴藏着强大生命力的幼苗，坚决地斩断了企图把红卫兵扼杀在摇篮里的资产阶级反动路线的黑手；是毛主席高度赞扬和坚决支持了红卫兵的大无畏革命造反精神；是毛主席和他的最亲密战友林彪副统帅，一次又一次亲切地接见了成千上万的红卫兵小将，号召红卫兵在大风大浪中经风雨见世面……。伟大领袖毛主席的无限关怀，当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家的强大声音，象春雷动地，在短短的时间内，红卫兵的星星之火如烈焰滚滚，燃遍全中国，辉映全世界。
    红卫兵从她诞生那天起，就誓作毛主席最最忠实的红小兵，对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。
    红卫兵从她诞生那天起，就作为无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋，登上政治斗争舞台。在自己的鲜红大旗上，金光闪闪地写下了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”
    红卫兵一登上政治斗争舞台，就在毛泽东思想的指导下，在无产阶级文化大革命的主力军——工农兵的全力支持下，以无比的英雄气概，“杀”出校门，冲向社会，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，把旧世界打了个落花流水。红卫兵驱散了资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，粉碎了反革命的围剿，击败了它们一次又一次的疯狂反扑，夺取了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。
    红卫兵在光焰万丈的毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争中，迎险风，战恶浪，成为毛泽东时代的敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命的闯将。红卫兵不愧为社会主义革命新阶段的一支最可贵的政治突击力量；红卫兵为无产阶级文化大革命立下了丰功伟绩，在国际无产阶级革命史上写下了不朽的篇章。
    红卫兵沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向，历尽无数惊涛骇浪，冲破重重急流险滩，驶入了新的战斗航程；今天，我们在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，更加紧密地团结起来了，联合起来了！
    我们成立了自己新型的革命组织机构——首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会，这是我们中等学校红卫兵的最高权力机构。在代表大会闭会期间，设立一个委员会，作为常设机构，处理日常事务工作。
    我们的最高红司令是最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    我们的指导思想是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我们是中国人民解放军的最强大的后备军。
    我们的组织原则是民主集中制。
    我们红卫兵以劳动人民家庭（工、农、兵、革命干部和其它劳动者）出身的革命学生为主体，非劳动人民家庭出身的，对毛主席有深厚感情，有无产阶级的革命精神，一贯在政治思想上表现比较好的，也可以参加。
    我们无产阶级革命派钢铁般的战斗口号是：革命无罪，造反有理！
    摆在我们面前的最根本的任务，就是要牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领——十六条，充分依靠群众，大搞群众运动，把社会主义革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
  毛主席教导我们：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”经过几个月来的艰苦奋斗，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经取得伟大胜利，并且还在节节胜利，广大革命群众发动起来了；资产阶级反动路线已陷于四面楚歌、全面惨败的境地。我们面临的，是一片光明，一片大好形势。但是，“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们清楚地看到，资产阶级反动路线的余毒还没有彻底肃清，它的社会基础远没有被摧毁，一小撮反革命修正主义分子还没有彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务还没有完成。种种迹象表明，当前出现了一股资本主义复辟的反革命逆流。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，人还在，心不死，他们还在负隅顽抗，同社会上的牛鬼蛇神遥相呼应，向无产阶级革命派反攻倒算，妄图否定无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”无产阶级革命派必须联合起来，击退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，痛击资本主义的反革命复辟逆流，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把资产阶级反动路线批倒、批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    现在，毛主席已经发出了“复课闹革命”的伟大号召，期待着我们把中学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。多少年来，资产阶级及其在党内的代理人，在学校中顽固推行反革命修正主义的教育路线，对抗毛主席的无产阶级教育路线；中学是他们用以同无产阶级争夺青年一代的重要阵地。“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”领袖的教导，就是对我们的最高指示。我们要立即回到学校去，夺回被一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级分子盘踞的阵地，把反革命修正主义分子斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，打碎修正主义教育路线的枷锁，冲破旧教育制度的罗网，开创无产阶级教育的新天地，把我们的学校办成培养共产主义接班人的坚强堡垒，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗牢牢插在中等学校的阵地上！
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”有了政权就有了一切，丧失了政权，就丧失了一切。一个“权”字，集中地表现了整个社会主义社会的阶级斗争。我们红卫兵战士就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无所畏惧地去造资产阶级的反，翻剥削阶级的天，就是要坚定不移地为无产阶级夺权，为无产阶级掌权，把党、政、财、文大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级的手中。
    要夺权，就必须实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，否则夺权就是一句空话。“刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”当前，以教学班为基础实现全校大联合是一种很好的形式。它有利于无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，有利于彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，有利于彻底完成学校一斗、二批、三改的伟大历史任务。我们红卫兵要起模范带头作用，在实现这种联合的过程中，不断壮大左派的力量，发展革命派的阶级队伍，为革命派大联合作出贡献。
    要夺权，就必须坚决贯彻毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的正确方针。这是取得夺权斗争胜利的根本保证。中学革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，是由革命师生、革命领导干部以及解放军代表组成，它必须是革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的。有人歪曲革命的“三结合”的方针，搞折中主义，调和主义，合二而一，妄图混水摸鱼，实行反革命复辟，这是绝对办不到的。一切红卫兵，一切革命派，必须及时揭露，坚决反对。
    实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，这是毛主席的伟大战略思想。毛主席所亲自制定的党的阶级路线，就是要分清敌我友，坚决依靠左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，彻底孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极端反动的右派分子。是否愿意并且真正逐步实行团结百分之九十五以上的干部和群众，这是检验执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，还是推行资产阶级反动路线的试金石。对于那些犯了错误的干部、教师和学生，必须执行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的党的传统方针，满腔热情地启发他们的觉悟，欢迎他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。就是犯了严重错误的人，也要根据毛主席的指示，只要不是反党反社会主义而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要给他们改过的机会，让他们将功赎罪。对于反动的“血统论”以及排斥一切、反对一切、打倒一切的无政府主义思潮，关门主义的倾向，都必须彻底清算，坚决打倒！
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场破“私”立“公”的思想大革命。目前，这个革命正在更广泛、更深入地触及人们的灵魂。夺“私”字的权，革“私”字的命，成了运动深入发展的关键。林彪副统帅指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”每一个红卫兵战士都必须在灵魂深处开辟灭资兴无的战场，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，实现思想革命化。当前特别要大学“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》、《整顿党的作风》、《党委会的工作方法》等毛主席的光辉著作，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，狠抓世界观的改造，沿着毛主席指引的知识分子同工农群众相结合的宽广大道，在大风大浪中树立完全、彻底的为人民服务的世界观。红卫兵战士必须在整风中克服风头主义、小团体主义、无政府主义、极端民主化、个人主义等资产阶级思想倾向，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，用毛主席提出的接班人的五项条件严格要求自己，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠的接班人，保证我们的社会主义铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
    中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命军队。我们要象人民解放军那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席、忠于党、忠于人民，把我们的红卫兵组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。我们深深体会到毛泽东思想是革命人民的命根子，是红卫兵的命根子，掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，我们就能战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难，把革命进行到底！这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂。让我们积极响应林彪副统帅的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮。读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，永远做毛主席的好战士、好学生。
      “世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。……世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”
    红卫兵战士们，同志们！我们的伟大领袖在召唤，我们的革命父兄在期望，让我们信心百倍地迎接更大的战斗吧！
      “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们将亲手埋葬帝国主义，我们将宣告帝国主义、修正主义在我们这一代实行“和平演变”的幻想彻底破产。我们决心同全国人民一道，把我们的祖国建设成为伟大的社会主义强国；同全世界革命人民一道，创立一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界！
    红卫兵战士们，同志们，我们是祖国的未来，我们是世界的希望。红旗我们高高举，越举越鲜明，战歌我们唱下去，越唱越响亮。让我们在革命的暴风雨中乘胜前进，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全球！
    英雄的红卫兵万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
