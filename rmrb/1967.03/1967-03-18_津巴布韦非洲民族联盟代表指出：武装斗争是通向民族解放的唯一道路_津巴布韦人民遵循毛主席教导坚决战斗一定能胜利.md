In the run-up to "Zimbabwe Day" (March 17), the chief representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union in Dar es Salaam, Chihuta, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the struggle of the Zimbabwean people against the Smith colonial regime and their fight for national liberation. He said, "Armed struggle is the only path to national liberation."

Chihuta said, "The struggle of the Zimbabwean African people will follow the great revolutionary leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and his guidance: 'Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory.' Because we know that we are waging a just war. No matter what temporary difficulties we encounter, we are confident that ultimate victory will be ours."

He recalled the armed struggle of the Zimbabwean people, saying that the Zimbabwean people had held a series of protest rallies and demonstrations to demand national liberation and had appealed to the British government. However, all this provoked brutal repression from the colonial authorities. He said: In July 1964, the Zimbabwean people were forced to take up arms against the colonial enemy, igniting the flames of armed struggle. In the past year, Zimbabwean guerrillas have fought bravely in the mountains, forests, villages, and towns of Zimbabwe, killing and wounding more than 200 Smith colonial troops and police, shooting down many enemy helicopters, and driving away large numbers of colonists from areas where the guerrillas were active. The Zimbabwean people, in coordination with the armed struggle, have also carried out extensive other activities against the enemy, striking a powerful blow against the Smith colonial regime.

Chihuta pointed out that as the armed struggle of the Zimbabwean people unfolded, the Smith regime, on the one hand, carried out brutal repression of the African people's armed struggle, tightened fascist rule, banned the activities of the Zimbabwe African National Union within the country, arrested some of the organization's leaders and many African freedom fighters, and carried out mad persecution of Africans. Currently, more than 2,500 Zimbabweans have been detained or otherwise persecuted. Chihuta pointed out, "The more brutal the enemy, the more resolute the people's struggle."

Chihuta said that in November 1965, Smith, with the connivance of British imperialism, illegally declared so-called "independence." He said, "The Zimbabwean African people regard Smith's declaration of 'independence' as an insult to their dignity and an attack on their nation, which has accelerated their plans to launch a national liberation war."

Chihuta emphasized that the victory of the armed struggle has further strengthened the confidence of the African masses in ultimate victory. More and more people are joining the armed struggle. More and more people are helping the freedom fighters, providing them with shelter, food, and clothing, and protecting them from enemy arrest. "They are now more determined than ever to liberate Zimbabwe at any cost, willing to shed more blood for the liberation of their beloved country."

Chihuta pointed out that the Smith regime has obtained weapons from Britain and other NATO countries, as well as from South Africa and Portugal. "But the struggle in Zimbabwe will not be decided by weapons alone. The people, especially the peasant and worker masses, are the decisive factor. Although the enemy temporarily has the upper hand in weapons, we believe we will surely achieve final victory."

Chihuta condemned the British government's hypocritical sanctions and actual collusion with the Smith colonial regime. He said, "For us Zimbabweans, Wilson and Smith are birds of a feather."

In his conversation, Chihuta expressed gratitude for the moral and material support and aid provided by the peoples of Asia and Africa to the struggle of the Zimbabwean people. He concluded, "We are far from having achieved our goal. This is a long struggle, but all conditions are favorable for the success of the revolution."

    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟代表指出：
    武装斗争是通向民族解放的唯一道路
    津巴布韦人民遵循毛主席教导坚决战斗一定能胜利
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十六日电　在“津巴布韦日”（三月十七日）的前夕，津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆首席代表契胡塔对新华社记者畅谈了津巴布韦人民反对史密斯殖民主义政权、争取民族解放的斗争。他说：“武装斗争是通向民族解放的唯一道路。”
    契胡塔说：“我们津巴布韦非洲人民的斗争，也将遵循中国人民的伟大革命领袖毛主席所指示的人民的逻辑：‘斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利’。因为我们知道，我们进行的是正义的战争，不管我们会碰到什么样的暂时困难，我们坚信，最后胜利是属于我们的。”
    他回顾津巴布韦人民的武装斗争时说，津巴布韦人民为了争取民族解放曾经举行过一系列抗议集会、示威游行，还向英国政府发出呼吁，但是这一切引起了殖民当局对人民的残酷镇压。他说：一九六四年七月，津巴布韦人民被迫拿起武器打击殖民主义敌人，点燃了武装斗争的火焰。在过去一年中，津巴布韦游击队在津巴布韦的山区、森林、乡村和城镇中进行了英勇的战斗，打死、打伤两百多名史密斯殖民军队和警察，击落敌人许多架直升飞机，大批殖民者从游击队活跃的地区逃走了。津巴布韦非洲人民配合武装斗争，还广泛地展开了对付敌人的其他活动，有力地打击了史密斯殖民政权。
    契胡塔指出，随着津巴布韦人民武装斗争的开展，史密斯政权一方面对非洲人民的武装斗争进行残酷的镇压，加紧实行法西斯统治，禁止了津巴布韦非洲民族联盟在国内的活动，拘捕了这个组织的一些领导人和许多非洲自由战士，对非洲人进行疯狂的迫害。目前，遭到拘留或其他迫害的津巴布韦人达到两千五百多名。契胡塔指出，“敌人越是残暴，人民的斗争也就越是坚决。”
    契胡塔说，在一九六五年十一月，史密斯在英国帝国主义的纵容下，非法宣布了所谓“独立”。他说：“津巴布韦非洲人民认为史密斯宣布的‘独立’是对他们的尊严的侮辱，是对他们的民族的攻击，使他们加速制定了发动民族解放战争的计划。”
    契胡塔强调指出：武装斗争的胜利进一步加强了非洲群众对最后胜利的信心。越来越多的人参加了武装斗争。越来越多的人帮助自由战士，给他们住所、食物和衣服，掩护他们不受敌人逮捕。“他们现在比过去任何时候都更加坚定，不惜一切代价解放津巴布韦，情愿为他们可爱的国家的解放流更多的血。”
    契胡塔指出：史密斯政权从英国和北大西洋集团其他国家以及南非、葡萄牙获得武器，“但是，津巴布韦的斗争不会单单由武器来决定。人民，特别是农民和工人群众是决定性的因素。尽管敌人在武器方面暂时占优势，我们相信我们定将取得最后胜利。”
    契胡塔谴责了英国政府对史密斯殖民政权的假制裁真包庇的阴谋。他说：“对我们津巴布韦人来说，威尔逊和史密斯是一丘之貉。”
    契胡塔在谈话中对亚非国家人民对津巴布韦人民斗争在道义上或物质上的支持和援助表示感谢。他最后说：“我们远没有达到我们的目的。这是一个长期的斗争，但是一切条件都有利于革命的成功。”
