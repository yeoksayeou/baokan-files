During our visit to heroic Albania, we witnessed firsthand how the Albanian people, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Labor Party, are advancing boldly on the road of revolutionization. The Albanian Labor Party has recently taken a series of major revolutionization measures, which have promoted the ideological revolutionization of the masses, accelerated the progress of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and filled the entire Albania with a vibrant revolutionary atmosphere.

Go to the grassroots, go to the production front line
The Albanian Labor Party calls on cadres at all levels to "go to the grassroots, go to the production front line!" From cadres in central organs to district committee secretaries, from high-ranking military officers of the people's army to scientific and technical personnel and cultural workers, tens of thousands of cadres have gone to the mountains and countryside, to factories and villages to become ordinary laborers. They do not care about their positions or remuneration, showing a lofty communist spirit. They say: "We used to come from workers and peasants, and now we are going back to workers and peasants, forever maintaining the character of the working people."

In the newly built tractor parts factory in Tirana, from the director to the workers, there are many cadres who have been sent down. Among them, 65 workers were originally military officers. They proudly say: "Our factory is a cadre-sent-down factory." Brilikli, who works in the machine cleaning workshop, started as an apprentice at the age of seven and later took up arms to become a guerrilla. Last year, the Party Central Committee called for going to the production front line, and he said: "I was originally a worker, and now I still want to be a worker." Some people thought that he was a military officer and wondered if he could go back to being a worker. He firmly said: "When I joined the guerrilla, I never thought about becoming a military officer, but to eliminate the enemy. Now that I am a military officer, why can't I go back to be an ordinary worker?"

In the northern mountainous area of Albania, Zemar Shemari, the director of the "Stalin Cooperative," was originally the secretary of the Skodra District Committee. More than twenty years ago, he fought as a guerrilla in this area. After being sent down to the cooperative, he took the lead in labor and cared for the masses in every way. Therefore, the masses regard him as a "close friend." Under his influence, even some retired elderly people voluntarily formed an "old man production team" to participate in land cultivation. The community members all say: "Since Zemar Shemari came to our community, he has worked with the masses from morning to night every day. There is no one, young or old, who does not say: 'Zemar Shemari is our good example.'"

Due to the large number of cadres being sent down, the number of cadres in various organs from the central to the local levels has been greatly reduced, and the number of non-production personnel has been significantly reduced, greatly strengthening the grassroots forces. Cadres going to the grassroots have strengthened the Party's ties with the people, inspired the masses' revolutionary spirit, and been warmly welcomed by the people.

Artists combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers
In the process of implementing the revolutionization measures proposed by the Labor Party Central Committee, Albania has launched a revolution in literature, art, culture, and education. Bourgeois literature and art have been criticized, and in their place are vibrant revolutionary and militant dramas and dances. A large number of writers, poets, painters, and actors have gone deep into the countryside and factories to live with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Last year, the National Ballet of Tirana staged a performance of our country's revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," which was enthusiastically received by the audience every time it was performed. The audience unanimously said: "This is a play with revolutionary content and profound educational significance." Wu Qinghua in "The Red Detachment of Women" is deeply loved by the Albanian people. The actress who plays Wu Qinghua is a famous Albanian ballet dancer. Every time she performs the scene where Wu Qinghua goes to Hongshi Village to join the Red Detachment of Women and enthusiastically kisses the red flag of the Red Detachment of Women, she is moved to tears. This Albanian actress is the daughter of a martyr. She said: "I have performed ballet for several decades, but in the past, I always performed princesses and ladies from the 18th and 19th centuries, singing the praises of bourgeois ideas and lifestyles, and the roles in the plays had nothing to do with me. Since performing 'The Red Detachment of Women,' I have for the first time felt that the role I am playing is like performing my own life story. Wu Qinghua finding the Red Detachment of Women is like me finding the Party after coming out of the concentration camp." Now, the ballet theater has completely stopped performing those old plays that sang the praises of bourgeois talents. The actors have gone deep into the countryside and factories, and have created new dances such as "The Textile Workers' Dance" by themselves, singing the praises of revolution and labor, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

A large number of artists have gone deep into the countryside and factories for a long time, living, eating, and working with the masses, learning from the masses, and transforming their thoughts, achieving great results. Konstantin Shala, a solo performer from the "Hero City" Fier, talked about his gains from going to the countryside: "In the past, I had a wrong idea that I was afraid my voice would be ruined if I went to the countryside to work, and I wouldn't be able to sing well. But after working, not only did my voice not get ruined, but I sang even better, because participating in labor increased my love for the working people." Musician Kastri, who had lived in the city for more than twenty years, went deep into the factories and countryside this time, worked with the masses, collected one hundred folk songs, and created "The Little Folk Singer," winning the third prize in music creation. He enthusiastically told his comrades: "We sing the praises of the working people, but we do not labor ourselves, so the works we write are false. Only by laboring ourselves can we write works that sing the praises of labor, and only then can we be welcomed by the working people."

"Be a revolutionary actor, be a people's actor!" This is the slogan put forward by the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe in the process of implementing revolutionization measures. They responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and last year divided into seven performance groups, carrying their own luggage, musical instruments, and props, climbing mountains and crossing rivers to perform for the people in the mountainous areas and border guards. Each performance group has traveled through hundreds of mountain villages, walked hundreds of kilometers, and wherever they go, they live, eat, and work with the local people, sing for them, and serve them. The community members happily said: "The guerrilla actors of more than twenty years ago have returned!" The elderly affectionately embraced the actors, saying: "Good children, you must always fight like the guerrillas!"

Pass on the revolutionary baton from generation to generation!
In implementing the revolutionization measures, Albania has placed emphasis on politics, strengthening class education and revolutionary tradition education as an important aspect. The Labor Party attaches great importance to cultivating and training a large number of successors to the cause of proletarian revolution. The Labor Party believes that this is a matter of whether the next generation can continue to advance along the correct path of Marxism-Leninism, and whether the leadership of the Party and the state can continue to be in the hands of proletarian revolutionaries. Comrade Enver Hoxha earnestly teaches the youth: "To keep the fighting baton pure and pass it on from generation to generation."

The Albanian youth enthusiastically responded to the call of the Labor Party. Through various lively and vivid forms, they widely learn the revolutionary spirit of the older generation and carry it forward. Many high mountains and dense forests where the guerrillas fought in the past have become places where the youth hold military camps. The high Dajti Mountain east of Tirana was the guerrilla camp in those days. Now, whenever there is a holiday or vacation, the youth of Tirana, students, and workers go up to Dajti Mountain in groups. During the day, they climb mountains, march, and practice combat. At night, the youth gather around the campfire to sing "The Eagle of the Guerrillas," recite poems praising the guerrillas during the national liberation war, and recall the guerrilla life of those days.

Last year, the Albanian youth followed the path of the first guerrilla brigade of the past and held a "Long March." In 1942, the German fascists launched a "winter offensive" against the northern guerrillas. The first guerrilla brigade, which was active in the southern mountains, was ordered to march north to foil the enemy's plot. Today, more than a thousand young men and women from all over Albania have formed a "Youth March Brigade," dressed in the military uniforms of the guerrillas of the past, carrying guns and cannons, led by Vehbi, who once served as a platoon leader in the first brigade, and began the "Long March" to learn revolutionary traditions.

The "Youth March Brigade" arrived at the high Martesh Peak and encountered heavy snow and thick fog. The youth bravely said: "The heavy snow did not stop the warriors of the first brigade in the past, and it will not stop the young generation advancing along the path of the first brigade today!" They overcame various difficulties and arrived at a "cliff stone" covered with bullet holes. Old guerrilla Vehbi told the youth about the heroic deeds of the guerrillas fighting off the enemy's attack here. When passing through Pishka Village, the former commander of the first brigade, Shehu, personally came to meet the marching youth. He told the youth that the first brigade had encountered great difficulties here, but the guerrillas, with high morale, unanimously swore "to continue to advance!" The youth were inspired. Shehu congratulated them: "With high revolutionary spirit and fervent feelings, learn the heroic chapters of the national liberation war."

The heroic Albanian youth, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the older generation, will forever advance, advance! The heroic Albania, this great socialist beacon in Europe, will forever shine with brilliant light!

### 阿尔巴尼亚在革命化大道上奋勇前进

    阿尔巴尼亚在革命化大道上奋勇前进
    中国新闻工作者代表团
    在访问英雄的阿尔巴尼亚过程中，我们亲眼看到了阿尔巴尼亚人民在恩维尔·霍查同志和劳动党的领导下，正在革命化的大道上奋勇前进。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党近年来采取的一系列重大革命化措施，促进了人民群众的思想革命化，加速了社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的进程。整个阿尔巴尼亚充满一片生气勃勃的革命景象。
    到基层去，到生产第一线去
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党号召各级干部“到基层去，到生产第一线去！”从中央机关干部到各区委书记，从人民军高级军官到科学技术人员、文艺工作者，成千上万的干部，纷纷上山下乡，到工厂、农村去当一个普通劳动者。他们不计地位，不计报酬，表现了崇高的共产主义精神。他们说：“我们从前来自工人、农民，现在再回到工人、农民中去，永远保持劳动人民的本色。”
    地拉那新建成的拖拉机配件厂，从厂长到工人，有许多下放干部，其中有六十五名工人原来是人民军军官。他们自豪地说：“我们这个厂是个干部下放工厂。”在机件清理车间工作的勃里克利同志，七岁当徒工，后来拿起枪杆当了游击队员。去年党中央号召到生产第一线去，他说：“我原来是个工人，现在还要求去当工人。”有的人考虑他是个军官，再去当工人行不行，他坚定地说：“当我参加游击队时，从来没有想到是为了当军官，而是为了消灭敌人。现在当了军官为什么不能回去再当一个普通工人呢？”
    在阿尔巴尼亚北部山区“斯大林合作社”担任社长的泽玛尔·舍马里同志，原来是斯库台区委书记。二十多年前他曾在这一带打过游击。他下放到合作社后，就带头劳动，处处关心群众。因此，群众把他看成“贴心人”。在他的影响下，甚至一些退休的老年人，也自动组成一个“老头生产队”，参加整地劳动。社员们都说：“泽玛尔·舍马里同志从下放到我们社以来，每天和群众一起从早干到晚。这里的大人小孩没有一个人不说：‘泽玛尔同志是我们的好榜样’。”
    由于大批干部下放，目前从中央到地方各级机关干部大量精减，非生产人员大量减少，大大加强了基层的力量。干部到基层去，密切了党和人民的联系，鼓舞了群众的革命精神，受到了人民热烈欢迎。
    文艺工作者与工农兵相结合
    在为实现劳动党中央提出的革命化措施过程中，阿尔巴尼亚掀起了文学艺术、文化教育的革命。资产阶级的文学艺术受到了批判，而代之以生气勃勃的革命化、战斗化的戏剧和歌舞。大批作家、诗人、画家、演员，深入农村、工厂，和工农兵一起生活。
    地拉那国家芭蕾舞剧院，去年突击排练了我国革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，每次演出都受到群众的热烈赞扬。观众异口同声地说：“这是一出有革命内容、有深刻教育意义的好戏。”《红色娘子军》中的主角吴清华深深为阿尔巴尼亚人民所热爱。扮演主角吴清华的是阿尔巴尼亚著名的芭蕾舞演员，每当她演到吴清华到红石乡参加娘子军，热烈地亲吻娘子军连红旗一场时，激动地流出热泪。这位阿尔巴尼亚女演员是一位烈士的女儿，她说：“我演了几十年芭蕾舞剧，过去都是演的十八、十九世纪的什么公主、小姐，宣扬的都是些资产阶级思想和生活方式，而且剧中角色和自己一点关系都没有。自从演出《红色娘子军》，我第一次感到扮演的角色正象演我自己的身世，吴清华找到娘子军，就象我从集中营出来找到党一样。”现在芭蕾舞剧院，完全停演了过去那些歌颂资产阶级才子佳人的坏戏。演员们深入农村、工厂，自己动手创作了新的《纺织工人舞》，歌颂革命和劳动，为工农兵服务。
    大批艺术家长期深入农村、工厂，和人民群众同吃、同住、同劳动，向群众学习，改造思想，取得了很大收获。“英雄城”发罗拉独唱演员康斯坦丁·沙拉，谈到自己深入农村的收获时说：“过去有个错误的想法，怕下到农村去劳动嗓子坏了，唱歌就唱不好了。可是劳动以后不但嗓子没坏，唱歌唱得更好了，就是因为参加劳动增强了热爱劳动人民的感情。”音乐工作者卡斯特利，过去在城市二十多年，这次深入工厂、农村，和人民群众同劳动，收集一百首民歌，创作了《小民歌手》，获得音乐创作第三名奖励。他热情地对同志们说：“我们是歌颂劳动人民的，可是自己却不劳动，这样写出的作品是假的。只有自己劳动了，才能写出歌颂劳动的作品，才能为劳动人民所欢迎。”
    “当革命的演员，当人民的演员！”这是阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团在为实现革命化措施中，提出的一个口号。他们响应党中央的号召，去年分成七个演出小组，自己扛着行李、乐器和道具，爬山涉水为山区人民群众和边防战士演出。每个演出小组都走遍几百个山村，步行数百公里，走到那里就和那里的人民同吃、同住、同劳动，为他们演唱，为他们服务。社员们高兴地说：“二十多年前的游击队演员们又回来了！”老人们亲切地拥抱演员，说：“好孩子们，你们要永远象游击队员那样战斗！”
    把革命接力棒一代代传下去！
    阿尔巴尼亚在贯彻革命化措施中，把突出政治、加强阶级教育和革命传统教育作为一个重要方面。劳动党十分重视培养和造就大批的无产阶级革命事业接班人。劳动党认为这是后一代能不能沿着马克思列宁主义的正确道路继续前进的问题，是党和国家的领导能不能继续掌握在无产阶级革命家手中的问题。恩维尔·霍查同志对青年语重心长地教导说：“要保持战斗接力棒的纯洁，把它一代一代传下去。”
    阿尔巴尼亚青年热烈响应劳动党的号召。他们通过各种生动活泼的形式，广泛学习老一代的革命精神，并把这种革命精神发扬光大。过去游击队员战斗过的许多高山密林，今天成了青年们举行军事野营的地方。地拉那东面高高的达依底山，是当年游击队的营地。现在每逢节日、假日，地拉那市的青年学生、工人们，一队队上达依底山去。白天，作爬山、行军、战斗演习。夜晚，青年们围坐在篝火旁唱《游击队员之鹰》，朗诵民族解放战争中歌颂游击队员的诗歌，重温当年游击队的战斗生活。
    去年，阿尔巴尼亚青年沿着当年游击队第一突击旅走过的道路，举行了一次“长征”。一九四二年德国法西斯发动了对北方游击队的“冬季攻势”，活跃在南方山区的第一突击旅，奉命长征北上，粉碎敌人的阴谋。今天来自阿尔巴尼亚各地一千多名男女青年，组成一支“青年行军旅”，穿着当年游击队员的军服，扛着枪炮，由当年在第一旅担任过连长的维赫比同志率领，开始了学习革命传统的“长征”。
    “青年行军旅”来到了高高的马尔塔什峰，遇到了鹅毛大雪，重重浓雾。青年们迎着大风雪坚毅地说：“大雪挡不住当年第一旅的战士，今天也挡不住沿着第一旅的道路前进的年青一代！”他们克服了种种困难，来到了一座布满斑斑弹痕的“断崖石”前。老游击队员维赫比，给青年们讲述了当年游击队在这里打退敌人进攻的英雄事迹。在行军途经皮什卡村时，当年第一突击旅旅长谢胡同志亲自赶来和行军的青年们会见。他告诉青年们，第一旅在这里曾遇到了极大的困难，但游击队员们怀着高昂的斗志，异口同声地宣誓“继续前进！”青年们听了精神振奋。谢胡同志祝贺大家：“以高度的革命精神，火热的感情，学习民族解放战争英雄的史章。”
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚青年，在老一代革命精神的鼓舞下，将永远不停地向前，向前！英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义明灯，将永远放射着灿烂的光芒！
