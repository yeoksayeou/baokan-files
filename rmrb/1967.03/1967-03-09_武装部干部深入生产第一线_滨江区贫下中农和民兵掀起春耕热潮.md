The cadres of the People's Armed Forces Department in Binjiang District of Harbin City firmly implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have entered the rural people's communes and production brigades, armed the revolutionary masses and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the plots of class enemies to sabotage production, and launched a spring plowing production campaign.

Recently, the leaders of this armed forces department discovered that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Binjiang District Party were unwilling to admit defeat. As the spring plowing season approached, they colluded with the ghosts and snakes in society, enticed cadres who had made minor mistakes to shirk their responsibilities, and attempted to sabotage agricultural production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Additionally, some units had incomplete leadership teams, and spring plowing production was clearly being affected. Facing this situation, these leaders, in accordance with the opinions of the armed forces department's Party organization and in conjunction with the class struggle situation of the Cultural Revolution, organized the department's cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great instructions and related discussions on "grasping revolution and promoting production." Subsequently, they took immediate action, leaving only a few on duty, and the rest all went deep into the grassroots to help the production brigades with spring plowing production.

The cadres of the armed forces department in the countryside insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "ensure that every movement and every struggle of ours is not only understood by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses, who can grasp it." In the production brigades, they held meetings, organized discussions, and gave lectures to vigorously propagate the strategic significance of grasping revolution and promoting production, propagate the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and expose the enemy's plots to use counter-revolutionary economism to sabotage agricultural production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Class in Rural People's Communes and Various Levels of Cadres," they promptly conducted in-depth propaganda. The commune members said after hearing their propaganda that Chairman Mao's words truly resonated with the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and they would definitely take the lead in grasping revolution and promoting production.

While propagating to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, the cadres of the armed forces department also strengthened the militia work, organized the militia to deeply study Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production," and fully unleashed the militia's role in production. After thorough mobilization, the broad militia took active action, becoming the backbone of spring plowing production. They led the broad poor and lower-middle peasants with the spirit of "seizing the day," making revolution at night and engaging in production during the day, quickly launching a campaign to grasp revolution and promote production.

After the issuance of the Central Military Commission's "Instructions on the Military's Great Support for Local Spring Plowing Production," the cadres of the armed forces department immediately studied it seriously and resolutely implemented it. For some production brigades with incomplete leadership teams, they actively studied Chairman Mao's discussions on cadre issues and the editorials of the "Red Flag" magazine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, helping them to further understand Chairman Mao's cadre policy, correctly distinguish and treat cadres, and attach importance to and give full play to the role of revolutionary cadres. On the other hand, they conducted thorough and detailed ideological work with cadres who had made general mistakes, educating them to shed their ideological burdens, correct their mistakes, stand tall, and make contributions in grasping revolution and promoting production. Through education, some cadres who had made mistakes made profound self-criticisms to the masses, lightened their loads, and actively led the masses in production, making the spring plowing production bustling with activity.

    武装部干部深入生产第一线
    滨江区贫下中农和民兵掀起春耕热潮
    据新华社哈尔滨七日电　哈尔滨市滨江区人民武装部的同志，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，深入农村人民公社生产队，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众和干部，粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，掀起春耕生产热潮。
    不久前，这个武装部的领导同志，发现滨江区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心失败，在备耕生产季节到来时，伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，拉拢犯有一般错误的干部撂挑子，企图破坏农业生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。另外，有些单位的领导班子不够健全，春耕生产眼看受到影响。面对这种情况，这个领导同志按照武装部党组织的意见，结合文化大革命的阶级斗争形势，组织部里的同志反复学习了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示及有关论述。随后，他们立即行动起来，除留下值班人员外，其余全部深入基层，帮助生产队搞好春耕生产。
    武装部的同志在农村坚持活学活用毛主席著作，处处按照毛主席的指示办事。他们遵循毛主席“使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握”的教导，在生产队通过开会、组织座谈、讲课等形式大力宣传抓革命，促生产的战略意义，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，揭露敌人用反革命经济主义破坏农业生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋。当《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表后，他们又及时地作深入的宣传。社员们听了他们宣传后说，毛主席的话都说到咱们贫下中农的心坎上，抓革命，促生产咱一定打头阵。
    在向广大贫下中农作宣传的同时，武装部的同志还加强了民兵工作，组织民兵深入学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，充分发挥民兵在生产中的突击作用。广大民兵经过充分的发动，积极行动起来，成了春耕生产的骨干，带动广大贫下中农以“只争朝夕”的精神，晚上闹革命，白天搞生产，迅速掀起了抓革命，促生产热潮。
    中共中央军委《关于军队大力支援地方抓好春耕生产的指示》发出后，武装部的同志又立即认真学习，坚决贯彻执行。有些生产队领导生产班子不够健全，他们一方面主动同贫下中农一起学习毛主席有关干部问题的论述，学习《红旗》杂志社论，使他们进一步理解了毛主席的干部政策，正确的区分和对待干部，重视和发挥革命干部的作用，另一方面，向犯有一般性错误的干部进行深入细致的思想工作，教育他们丢掉思想包袱，改正错误，挺起腰杆，在抓革命，促生产中做出贡献。通过教育，一些犯有错误的干部向群众作了深刻的检查，轻装上阵，积极领导群众生产，把备耕和春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
