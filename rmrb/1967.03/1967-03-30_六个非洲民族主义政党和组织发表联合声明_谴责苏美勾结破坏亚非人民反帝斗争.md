Six African nationalist parties and organizations issued a joint statement in Cairo on March 27, strongly condemning the "Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council" held in Nicosia under the control of the Soviet revisionists and the current "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" held in Beirut.

The joint statement said: "In order to fully support the struggle of the Asian and African peoples, it is absolutely necessary to expose and condemn the sabotage and division of the Asian-African solidarity anti-imperialist movement by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. This sabotage is specifically manifested in the illegal and divisive 'Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council' held in Nicosia and the current fake 'Third Asian-African Writers' Conference' held in the Lebanese capital, Beirut." The statement also condemned the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union against the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and for national liberation.

The statement was jointly signed by the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Basutoland Congress Party, the Swaziland Progressive Party, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, the South West Africa People's Organization, and a nationalist organization from Angola. Bobbie Marks, the representative of the Bechuanaland People's Party in Cairo, read the statement at a rally marking the seventh anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre in Azania.

The statement said: "In order to fully support the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, it is absolutely necessary to expose and condemn the 'peace talks' conspiracy jointly plotted by the United States and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue.

"In order to fully support the struggle of the Palestinian people, it is absolutely necessary to expose and condemn the use of the so-called 'spirit of Tashkent,' a product of U.S.-Soviet collusion in the Middle East, to expose and condemn the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's sacrifice of the interests of the heroic Palestinian people, and to continue maintaining diplomatic relations with the Zionist Jews of Israel, and to encourage and strengthen Israel's aggression against the Middle East.

"In order to wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Latin American peoples, it is absolutely necessary to expose and condemn the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's provision of so-called economic aid to dictatorial regimes, betraying the patriotic armed struggle of the Latin American peoples.

"In order to wholeheartedly support the struggle of the peoples of the world, it is absolutely necessary to expose and condemn the collusion of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world."

The statement concluded: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people must be organized. The reactionaries in China must be organized by the people to be overthrown. Anything that is reactionary, if you do not beat it, it will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself.'"

    联合声明说：“为了全力支持亚非人民的斗争，绝对有必要揭露和谴责苏联修正主义统治集团破坏和分裂亚非团结反帝运动。这种破坏的具体表现是：在尼科西亚召开了非法和分裂性的‘第八届亚非团结理事会’会议和目前在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行的伪‘第三届亚非作家大会’”。声明还谴责美苏勾结反对亚非人民正在进行的反对帝国主义和争取民族解放的斗争。
    声明是由贝专纳人民党、巴苏陀兰大会党、斯威士兰进步党、莫三鼻给革命委员会、西南非洲民族联盟和安哥拉的一个民族主义组织联合签署的。贝专纳人民党驻开罗代表波比·马克在就阿扎尼亚沙佩维尔大屠杀事件七周年举行的集会上宣读了这项声明。
    声明说：“为了全力支持越南人民的英勇斗争，完全有必要揭露和谴责美苏在越南问题上联合策划的‘和谈’阴谋。
      “为了全力支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争，完全有必要揭露和谴责在中东运用美苏勾结的产物所谓塔什干精神，揭露和谴责苏修统治集团牺牲英勇的巴勒斯坦人民的利益，与以色列的犹太复国主义者继续保持外交关系，并怂恿和加强以色列对中东的侵略。
      “为了全心全意地支持拉丁美洲人民的斗争，完全有必要揭露和谴责苏修统治集团向专制政权提供所谓的经济援助，出卖拉丁美洲人民的爱国武装斗争。
      “为了全心全意地支持全世界人民的斗争，完全有必要揭露和谴责苏修统治集团同美帝国主义合作来主宰世界。”
    声明最后说：“毛主席教导我们：‘人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。’”
