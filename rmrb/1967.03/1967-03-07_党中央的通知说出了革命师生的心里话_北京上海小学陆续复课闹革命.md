The Central Committee's notice speaks for the hearts of revolutionary teachers and students. Elementary schools in Beijing and Shanghai are gradually resuming classes and carrying out the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Revolutionary teachers and students in the capital's elementary schools have firmly responded to the call in the "Draft Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Primary Schools" to resume classes and carry out the revolution. They are actively preparing to reopen schools with a spirit of "seizing the day." Some schools have already reopened with a brand-new appearance.

At this critical moment when the revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the Central Committee issued the draft notice on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools. This has greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers and students in the capital. They have held discussion meetings, symposiums, and oath-taking rallies to resume classes and carry out the revolution, expressing their enthusiastic support for the Central Committee's notice. They believe that the Central Committee's notice is a mobilization order to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools to a new high tide and a signal to reform the old educational system. The Central Committee's notice speaks for the hearts of revolutionary teachers and students and will rally them under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought to unite and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. They say, "resuming classes to carry out the revolution" first means "opening the class of class struggle" and "opening the class of deeply carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in schools." The process of resuming classes and carrying out the revolution is the process of achieving a great alliance of the revolutionary masses and launching a power struggle against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. "Returning to school" is the only way to truly implement the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and complete the tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms.

In schools that have already reopened, a brand-new revolutionary atmosphere prevails everywhere. The school grounds are filled with the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and "The East Is Red" and other revolutionary songs. The first class in these reopened schools is to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. Students in grades one through four learn Chairman Mao's quotations, learn to read, and sing revolutionary songs. Senior students, in conjunction with the Cultural Revolution, learn Chairman Mao's quotations, the "Old Three Articles," and the "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," the "Sixteen Points," and sing revolutionary songs. They also arrange some arithmetic and other science courses. Revolutionary teachers and students have expressed their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's educational line and strive to make primary schools into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought!

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: All primary schools in Shanghai have gradually resumed classes since February 25th. On February 25th, revolutionary teachers and students from all primary schools in the city held a rally to solemnly pledge to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The meeting passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Representatives of revolutionary teachers, students, and revolutionary leading cadres from the schools unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's call, firmly implement the "Draft Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Primary Schools," and resolutely resume classes and carry out the revolution to welcome the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools.

In November last year, revolutionary teachers and students in Shanghai's primary schools broke through the so-called phased and batch-by-batch implementation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools imposed by the old municipal committee and rose up to rebel against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, they faced fierce counterattacks from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They diverted the direction of the struggle, incited students to fight teachers and teachers to fight each other, issued connection fees indiscriminately, and incited teachers to go out for "connections," causing the movement in the schools to come to a halt and the school's property to be severely damaged. The revolutionary masses realized that primary schools are an important front in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses must tightly unite and join forces to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and truly seize power to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools to the end.

Revolutionary teachers and staff who participated in the meeting seriously studied the "Draft Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Primary Schools" and related documents. They were full of spirit and determined to resume classes and carry out the revolution with the revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary cadres. Revolutionary teachers and staff representatives said that at this critical moment when our primary school revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the Central Committee issued the notice on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools. Primary schools must resume classes and carry out the revolution. We will firmly implement the Central Committee's instructions, prepare to resume classes and carry out the revolution with a spirit of "seizing the day," unite revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres, form a vast army of cultural revolution, and launch a new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools, making primary schools into schools of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary teachers and staff representatives said that to resume classes and carry out the revolution, we must firmly implement the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the revisionist line of running schools and the educational line. At this critical moment when the revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must study Chairman Mao's works earnestly, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, truly seize power, hold power, and use power well.

Revolutionary student representatives at the meeting expressed their determination to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resume classes and carry out the revolution, firmly act according to the spirit of the "Sixteen Points" and the Central Committee's instructions, thoroughly smash the plot of a handful of people with ulterior motives to divert the direction of the struggle and strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools, and carry out the revolution with revolutionary teachers and staff to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary schools to the end.

The revolutionary actions of primary school teachers and students to resume classes and carry out the revolution have received enthusiastic support from revolutionary parents. They beat drums and gongs, bringing good news to the venue. They said, the action of resuming classes and carrying out the revolution is very good!

    党中央的通知说出了革命师生的心里话
    北京上海小学陆续复课闹革命
    新华社六日讯　首都小学的革命师生，坚决响应《中共中央关于小学无产阶级文化大革命的通知（草案）》提出的复课闹革命的号召，正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神积极准备开学；有些学校已经以崭新的面貌正式开学了。
    在当前无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，中共中央发出关于小学无产阶级文化大革命的通知（草案），极大地鼓舞了首都小学革命师生。他们纷纷举行讨论会、座谈会和复课闹革命的誓师大会，表示热烈拥护党中央的通知。他们认为：党中央的通知是把小学无产阶级文化大革命推向新高潮的动员令，是改革旧教育制度的进军号。党中央的通知说出了革命师生的心里话，并将促使革命师生在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下联合起来、团结起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们说，“开课闹革命”，首先就是“开”阶级斗争的“课”，就是“开”学校里深入开展无产阶级文化大革命的“课”。复课闹革命的过程，就是实现革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争的过程。“打回学校去”，才能真正执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，才能胜利完成一斗二批三改的战斗任务。
    一批已经开学的学校，到处呈现出一片崭新的革命气象。校园里到处洋溢着毛主席语录歌和《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌声。这些学校开学的第一课就是大立毛泽东思想。一、二、三、四年级学生，都是学习毛主席语录，兼学识字，学唱革命歌曲。高年级学生结合文化大革命，学习毛主席语录、“老三篇”和《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》，学习十六条，学唱革命歌曲。同时也都安排一些算术和其他科学常识课程。革命师生们表示，要坚决贯彻毛主席的教育路线，为把小学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
    新华社上海六日电　上海全市小学从二月二十五日起陆续开学。二月二十五日，全市小学的革命师生举行了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极投入小学无产阶级文化大革命新高潮的誓师大会。
    大会通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    参加大会的小学革命派教师、学生代表和学校革命领导干部代表，一致表示坚决响应毛主席的号召，坚决贯彻执行《中共中央关于小学无产阶级文化大革命的通知（草案）》，决心复课闹革命，迎接小学无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮。
    去年十一月，上海市小学的革命师生冲破旧市委的所谓分期分批开展小学无产阶级文化大革命的条条框框，起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，但是受到了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的疯狂反扑。他们转移斗争大方向，挑动学生斗老师，老师斗老师，乱发串连费，煽动教师外出“串连”，使学校的运动停顿下来，学校的财物受到严重的破坏。革命派认识到，小学是无产阶级文化大革命的一条重要战线，革命派一定要紧紧团结起来，联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权，把权真正夺到手，才能把小学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    参加大会的革命教职员工认真学习了《中共中央关于小学无产阶级文化大革命的通知（草案）》和有关文件，他们精神焕发，决心和广大革命师生员工一起，复课闹革命。革命教职员工代表说，正当我们小学的革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权的关键时刻，中共中央发出了关于小学无产阶级文化大革命的通知（草案），小学要复课闹革命。我们坚决执行中共中央的指示，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，作好复课闹革命的准备，团结革命师生员工和革命干部，组成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，掀起小学的无产阶级文化大革命新高潮，把小学办成毛泽东思想的大学校。革命教职员工代表说，复课闹革命，必须坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清修正主义的办学路线和教育路线的影响。在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，真正夺好权，掌好权，用好权。
    革命学生代表在会上表示，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，复课闹革命，坚决按照十六条和中央指示精神办事，彻底粉碎一小撮别有用心的人企图转移斗争的大方向、扼杀小学无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋，和革命教职员工一起，复课闹革命，把小学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    小学革命师生复课闹革命的革命行动，得到了广大革命的学生家长的热烈支持。他们敲锣打鼓，把喜报送到会场。他们说，复课闹革命的行动好得很！
