The most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

We, the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, your most loyal Red Guards, salute you, the red sun in our hearts, our red commander, with the highest revolutionary greetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Dear Chairman Mao, today we are filled with boundless excitement as we report to you our battle news: the Conference of Red Guards Representatives of the Capital's Colleges and Universities has been officially established! The revolutionary factions of the three Red Guard headquarters in the capital have united in victory! We have united and joined hands! This is a great victory for your brilliant thoughts! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you!

Dear Chairman Mao, when we look back on the past period of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we cannot express enough our boundless respect and infinite love for you.

It was you who personally ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It was you who wisely discovered the Red Guards rising on the eastern horizon.

It was your affectionate care and meticulous nurturing that made the Red Guards grow like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, becoming the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It was still you, at the critical moment when the bourgeois reactionary line suppressed, attacked, and encircled the revolutionary factions, who dispelled the mist for us, corrected our course, and pointed out the direction. Under the guidance of your brilliant thoughts, we became clearer in mind, bolder in spirit, and rebelled, rebelled, and rebelled again, defeating the bourgeois reactionary line and overthrowing the monsters and demons.

Dear Chairman Mao, now the revolutionary ship is sailing against the wind and waves, advancing bravely. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The revolutionary tide of the proletarian revolutionary factions uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is surging forward, unstoppable. The January Revolution in Shanghai, the great seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanxi, the spring thunder in the Southwest, and the new dawn in the Northeast have brought us one good news after another. The monsters and demons are trembling with fear. The revolutionary masses are clapping their hands in joy. But as you have pointed out, "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggle." They are fighting to the death with us. At this crucial historical juncture where the two classes, two lines, and two roads are engaged in a decisive battle, we, the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, following your teachings, have overcome numerous obstacles and united! We will unite all revolutionary comrades and join forces with all revolutionary forces to form a mighty army of the proletarian revolution, launching a comprehensive and fierce total attack on the fortresses occupied by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Seize power! Seize power! Seize power! Take back all power and firmly grasp it in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions, making the people's country forever red!

Dear Chairman Mao, we deeply understand that Beijing is the capital of our great motherland and the heart of the world's revolutionary people. Here, we must not allow any monsters and demons to stir up trouble. We must rise up with a thousand-pound hammer and strike them down, making sure they never rise again! Let the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts fly forever high in the sky of the capital!

Dear Chairman Mao, we must strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, resolutely eliminate windism, factionalism, small-groupism, and anarchism. In short, we must carry out a revolution in our souls, overthrowing the "self" in our minds! We want to be revolutionaries to the end, not just a fleeting figure on the stage of history! We will push the Red Guard movement to a broader, deeper, and higher stage. We will achieve new victories and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We will follow your teachings, combine with the working and peasant masses, fight shoulder to shoulder with them, and jointly achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Most beloved Chairman Mao, we are your most loyal Red Guards. We love you, believe in you, admire you, and are loyal to you without bounds. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past eight or nine months has made us personally experience that: when facing difficulties, reading your books gives us strength; when lost, reading your books shows us the way. No matter how cunning the class enemies are, no matter how complex the class struggle is, as long as we act according to your teachings, we will surely be invincible and unstoppable.

We solemnly pledge to you: we will read your books, follow your words, and act according to your instructions for life! We will follow you in the great waves of class struggle and advance bravely! We will be reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but your revolutionary line will never be abandoned! Your brilliant thoughts will never be abandoned! Whoever does not carry out your revolutionary line, we will rebel against them! Whoever dares to defame your brilliant thoughts, we will overthrow them! Whoever dares to oppose you, we will overthrow them!

"Who controls the rise and fall of the vast land?" It is us! Us! Us proletarians! The future of China is ours! The future of the world is ours! We will definitely make the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts fly all over the world!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Our countless words condense into one sentence: We sincerely wish you, the red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    新华社二日讯　首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会给毛主席的致敬信最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们首都大专院校红卫兵，您的最忠实的红卫兵，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们的红司令，致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
    敬爱的毛主席，今天，我们以无比激动的心情，向您报告我们战斗的喜讯：首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会正式成立了！首都红卫兵三个司令部的革命派在战斗中胜利会师了！我们团结起来了，联合起来了！这是您的光辉思想的伟大胜利！这是以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    毛主席啊毛主席，当我们回顾前一段无产阶级文化大革命的斗争历程的时候，我们怎么也倾诉不尽对您的无比崇敬和无限热爱。
    是您亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。
    是您英明地发现了在东方地平线上出现的红卫兵。
    是您的亲切关怀和精心培育，红卫兵才如雨后春笋，茁壮成长，成了无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。
    还是您，在资产阶级反动路线压制革命，打击革命，围剿革命派的严重时刻，为我们驱散了弥雾，拨正了船头，指明了航向。在您的光辉思想的指引下，我们更加心明眼亮胆子壮，造反，造反，再造反，把资产阶级反动路线打了个落花流水，把牛鬼蛇神杀了个人仰马翻。
    敬爱的毛主席啊，如今，革命的航船正乘风破浪，勇往直前，无产阶级文化大革命又进入了一个崭新的阶段。无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的革命洪流，汹涌澎湃，势不可挡。上海“一月革命”的风暴，山西无产阶级革命派大夺权的狂飚，西南的春雷，东北的新曙光，送来了一个又一个喜报。牛鬼蛇神胆颤心惊。革命群众拍手称快。但是，正如您所指出的那样：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”他们正在和我们进行拚死的斗争。就在这两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路进行决战的重大历史关头，我们首都大专院校红卫兵按照您的教导，克服了重重障碍，团结起来了！联合起来了！我们将团结一切革命同志，联合一切革命力量，组成一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军，向那些被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所盘踞的堡垒，发起全面的猛烈的总攻击。向他们夺权！夺权！夺权！把一切大权夺回来！牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里，使人民的江山永远通红通红！
    敬爱的毛主席啊，我们深深地懂得，北京是我们伟大祖国的首都，世界革命人民的心脏，这里更不能容许任何牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪。我们一定要奋起千钧棒，把他们打倒在地，叫他们翻不了身！让您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，永远在首都的上空高高飘扬！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定要加强革命性，科学性和组织纪律性，坚决打掉风头主义，山头主义，小团体主义和无政府主义。一句话：在自己灵魂深处闹革命，打倒“私”字！夺自己头脑里“私”字的权！我们要做革命到底的战士，决不做历史舞台上昙花一现的人物！我们一定要把红卫兵运动推向一个更广阔、更深入、更高级的阶段。为无产阶级文化大革命建新功、立新劳！我们一定遵循您的教导，实行同工农群众相结合，和他们并肩战斗，共同夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们是您最忠实的红卫兵。我们对您无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。八九个月来的无产阶级文化大革命的实践，使我们亲身体会到：困难时读了您的书有力量，迷路时读了您的书知方向；无论阶级敌人多么狡猾，无论阶级斗争多么复杂，只要按您的教导办事，我们就一定能无往而不胜，无坚而不摧。
    我们向您老人家庄严宣誓：一定要一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，一辈子跟着您在阶级斗争的大风大浪里奋勇前进！做一个坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。头可断，血可流，您的革命路线永不丢！您的光辉思想永不丢！谁不执行您的革命路线，我们就造谁的反！谁敢诋毁您的光辉思想，我们就专谁的政！谁敢反对您，我们就打倒谁！
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们！我们！我们无产阶级！中国的前途是我们的！世界的前途是我们的！我们一定让您的光辉思想的伟大红旗插遍全世界！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们千言万语凝成一句话：最衷心地祝愿您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                      首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会
                                  一九六七年二月二十二日
