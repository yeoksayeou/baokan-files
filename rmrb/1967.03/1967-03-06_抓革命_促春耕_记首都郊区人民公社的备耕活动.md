The letter from the Central Committee of the Party to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country is like a timely rain, nourishing the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres, mobilizing and organizing millions of production troops to rush to the front lines of spring plowing.

Recently, we visited the suburbs of the capital, including Miyun, Huairou, Yanqing, Tongxian, and Fangshan. Everywhere, there is a vibrant scene of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Are the Main Force of Spring Plowing Production

“Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you in revolution!” The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs, filled with passion, studied the “Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country.” From the bottom of their hearts, they made such a vow. Seeing this letter, they felt as if they had seen the benevolent face of the great leader Chairman Mao; hearing this letter, they felt as if they had heard the warm voice of Chairman Mao.

The people's communes in various counties in the suburbs of the capital responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Party and are now universally holding three-level cadre meetings and meetings of all members of the production teams. At the three-level cadre meeting in Chahe People's Commune, Huairou County, they read the letter from the Central Committee of the Party over and over again. Many representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their determination at the meeting: Chairman Mao trusts us poor and lower-middle peasants so much, and we will definitely not disappoint his intentions. We will resolutely seize the revolution and promote production, and be the main force of spring plowing production.

The members of Gangshang Production Brigade, Chongguzhuang People's Commune, Fangshan County, use the evening to engage in the Cultural Revolution and the daytime to focus on spring plowing preparations. The former deputy secretary of the brigade's party branch was a fake labor model carefully cultivated by the old Beijing Municipal Committee. For seventeen years since liberation, he did not work at all and used despicable methods of deceiving superiors and oppressing subordinates to cheat personal honors. During the Four Clean-ups movement, due to the protection of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, his problems were not exposed. In this unprecedented Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants dragged this class enemy who had infiltrated the party out. The masses of Gangshang Brigade removed the heavy stone from their heads, and their socialist enthusiasm soared.

After the autumn harvest last year, this former deputy secretary of the party branch saw that the movement was going to hit him, so he abandoned the brigade's production. The entire brigade has more than two hundred mu of mechanized land, which was not covered in time. After a winter of wind and sun, the soil erosion situation was serious. On February 20th, after the snow, a poor peasant immediately proposed to harrow the land to preserve moisture, and the entire brigade's labor force took action, ensuring that these more than two hundred mu of cultivated land could be sown in time in the spring. This brigade is located at a higher elevation and has suffered from spring droughts every year. This year, it was also the poor and lower-middle peasants who took the initiative to propose digging wells and repairing canals before spring sowing. These two tasks are being carried out intensively.

The rural Cultural Revolution is a great driving force for spring plowing production. Many poor and lower-middle peasants discussed at meetings and exposed the evil facts of the old Beijing Municipal Committee in leading agricultural production, implementing the revisionist line. The old Beijing Municipal Committee used material incentives, did not propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and did not emphasize politics, causing some cadres and commune members to only know about sorghum and corn, losing the revolutionary direction. They expressed that in the future, they must emphasize politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, which is also the greatest guarantee for doing a good job in spring plowing production this year.

Dacang Brigade, Kangzhuang People's Commune, Yanqing County, suffered a severe hailstorm last year, and the state allocated a large amount of grain to support them. Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants have learned Chairman Mao's teachings on “self-reliance” and are determined to do a good job in this year's spring plowing production to make up for the losses caused by the disaster last year. An old poor peasant said well: “The crops may fall, but the people will not. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, cannot just ask the state for help. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and rely on our own efforts to do a good job in production.” This year, the brigade has accumulated more fertilizer than in previous years. The poor and lower-middle peasants, in order to reduce the cost of buying chemical fertilizer, decided to launch another fertilizer accumulation campaign. Some female commune members took the initiative to collect urine from house to house before dawn. The members of the third team are working hard to transport fertilizer, and have already delivered all the fertilizer to the fields.

Cadres Stand Tall and Boldly Lead Production

Mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres is an important issue in doing a good job in spring plowing production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of the capital are implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy without any compromise, using class analysis methods, correctly treating cadres, and doing a good job in cadre thought work.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dacang Brigade, Kangzhuang People's Commune, Yanqing County, studied the “Sixteen Points” and relevant editorials in the “Red Flag” magazine and the “People's Daily.” A poor peasant said: “We must conduct a class analysis of those in power, distinguishing between proletarian leaders and those in power who take the capitalist road. If we count walnuts and chestnuts together and do not distinguish between good and bad in one pot, it is easy for class enemies to find loopholes.” They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, used class analysis methods to identify cadres, and used the method of “two-line struggle” to treat cadres. After analysis, they believed that most of the cadres in this brigade are good or relatively good, and they should be firmly relied upon. The party branch secretary and the brigade leader, although they have shortcomings and mistakes, as long as they seriously reflect and correct their mistakes, they should adopt an attitude of “punishing past mistakes and curing the sick to save people,” and absolutely not beat them to death with one stick or kick them away with one foot.

In the early stages of the movement, some poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade were afraid of retaliation and did not dare to give cadres feedback. They studied “Opposing Liberalism” and the “Three Articles” and dispelled their concerns. They realized that it is necessary to criticize and struggle against cadres who make mistakes in order to save them and prevent them from falling into the revisionist quagmire. They not only studied and applied Chairman Mao's works themselves but also helped cadres study and did thought work on cadres' active thoughts. With their help, the brigade leader's idea of “waiting to step down” was eliminated.

Whether rural grassroots cadres can stand tall in spring plowing production depends on whether they can truly touch their souls in the Cultural Revolution, use Mao Zedong Thought to break private interests and establish public interests, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to “seize the revolution and promote production,” and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

From the beginning of the rural Cultural Revolution, many rural cadres had various concerns. They were afraid of making the countryside chaotic, afraid of the revolution reaching their own heads, and had a sense of resistance and grievance towards the big-character posters posted by the masses, and some even waited to “step down.”

Jiaobaode, the brigade leader of Jiaocun Brigade, Miaocheng People's Commune, Huairou County, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant quotations, and his thoughts gradually turned around. When he looked at the big-character posters again, he no longer had any resistance and instead felt that this was the greatest care and help from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Wang Hai, the deputy director of Zhaohe People's Commune, Zhangjiazhuang, proactively checked his work with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, “It's good that you can check.” Now, everyone comes to him for advice. This made Wang Hai very moved. He said, “As long as you believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and correct mistakes when they are made, you will gain the understanding of the poor and lower-middle peasants.”

The deputy brigade leader of Dongchahe Brigade, Chahe People's Commune, Huairou County, studied the “Three Articles” and sweated more with each study. He said, “Putting ‘self’ in the mind, the more you think, the more you feel ‘cheated.’ Putting ‘public’ in the heart, you won't think about ‘cheating’ or ‘not cheating.’ Chairman Mao handed us the reins, and we only have the duty to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants well, and we have no right to drop the burden and not do it.”

Establishing Production Teams to Implement Spring Plowing Plans

Under the call of the Central Committee of the Party to “mobilize all forces to immediately work hard to do a good job in spring plowing production,” many communes and brigades have established joint production teams to lead spring plowing.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xidianjiazhuang Brigade, Miyun County, said well, “Seizing the revolution and promoting production” is the great call of Chairman Mao, and we poor and lower-middle peasants support it a thousand times and will execute it a thousand times. Xidianjiazhuang Brigade and various production teams, through consultation, selected representatives to combine with some cadres trusted by the masses to form a team to lead spring plowing production. The members of this production team proactively went to the fields to check and understand the spring plowing production situation and then made production plans with the commune members and implemented specific measures. Since the establishment of the production team half a month ago, the irrigation canals of the entire brigade have been repaired, and the water from Miyun Reservoir can be used to irrigate the wheat. Currently, various production teams are actively transporting fertilizer to the fields, and some teams have achieved “people rest, machines do not stop.”

In some brigades or production teams we visited, the members of the production team handed over the spring plowing production plan to the broad masses of commune members for discussion, greatly mobilizing their enthusiasm for being masters of the house. In Chongguzhuang Brigade, Fangshan County, the production plan for previous years was decided by the cadres. This year's sowing plan was decided through democratic discussion by the commune members, and a comprehensive and reasonable adjustment was made to the crop rotation of the entire brigade. Poor peasant commune member Zhou Yongzhi was very satisfied with this, saying, “Adjusting the crop rotation is a major measure for increasing production. As long as there is hard work and sufficient fertilizer, a significant increase in production this year is assured.” When formulating this year's spring plowing production plan, the commune members also proposed to send more fertilizer to distant and thin fields; currently, a campaign to send fertilizer to these plots has been launched, laying the foundation for increasing production this year.

### 抓革命  促春耕——记首都郊区人民公社的备耕活动

    抓革命  促春耕
    ——记首都郊区人民公社的备耕活动
    党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，象一场及时雨，滋润了广大贫下中农和农村干部的心，动员和组织了千百万的生产大军，奔赴春耕第一线。
    最近，我们访问了首都郊区的密云、怀柔、延庆、通县、房山等地，到处是生气勃勃的抓革命、促生产的动人景象。
    贫下中农是春耕生产的主力军
    “毛主席啊，我们永远跟着您干革命！”郊区广大贫下中农满怀着激情学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，从心坎里发出了这样的誓言。看了这封信，他们就象见到了伟大领袖毛主席的慈祥面容；听了这封信，就仿佛听到了毛主席他老人家亲切的声音。
    首都郊区各县人民公社响应党中央的号召，正在普遍召开三级干部会议和生产队全体社员会议。在怀柔县茶坞公社的三级干部会议上，他们一遍又一遍地宣读了党中央的信。许多贫下中农代表在会上表示了自己的决心：毛主席这样信任我们贫下中农，我们决不辜负他老人家的心意，坚决抓革命，促生产，当好春耕生产的主力军。
    房山县崇各庄公社岗上大队的社员们，利用晚上时间搞文化大革命，白天大抓备耕工作。这个大队前党支部副书记，是旧北京市委精心培养的一个假劳动模范。解放十七年来，他根本不劳动，用欺上压下的恶劣手法，骗取个人荣誉。在四清运动中，由于旧北京市委的包庇，他的问题没有被揭发出来。在这场史无前例的文化大革命中，贫下中农把这个混入党内的阶级异己分子揪出来了。岗上大队的群众搬掉了压在头上的这块大石头，社会主义积极性大为高涨。
    去年秋收之后，这个前支部副书记看到这场运动要整到他的头上，就把队上的生产扔下不管。全大队有二百多亩机耕地，没有及时盖土，经过一冬风吹日晒，跑墒情况严重。二月二十日下雪后，有位贫农就及时提出趁雪耙地保墒的建议，全队劳动力立即行动，保证这二百多亩耕地能适时春播。这个大队地势较高，历年闹春旱。今年也是由贫下中农主动提出，在春播前抽人打井、修渠，这两项活路正在紧张地进行。
    农村文化大革命是推动春耕生产的巨大动力。许多贫下中农在讨论会上，纷纷揭露了旧北京市委在领导农业生产中，贯彻执行修正主义路线的罪恶事实。旧北京市委搞物质刺激，不宣传毛泽东思想，不突出政治，使一些干部、社员只知道高粱、玉米，迷失了革命的大方向。他们表示，今后一定要突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，这也是当前搞好春耕生产的最大保证。
    延庆县康庄公社大营大队去年遭受了特大的雹灾，国家调拨了大批粮食支援他们。现在，贫下中农学习了毛主席关于“自力更生”的教导，决心搞好今年的春耕生产，来弥补去年灾害造成的损失。一位贫农老大娘说得好：“庄稼倒了人不倒。我们广大贫下中农不能光向国家伸手，要按毛主席的指示办事，自力更生搞好生产。”今年这个队的粪肥比往年积得多，贫下中农为了减少买化肥的开支，决定再掀起一个积肥高潮。一些女社员主动担起积肥的任务，她们天不亮就起床挨家挨户把尿收集起来。三队社员全力突击送肥，已经把粪肥全部送到地里。
    干部挺起腰杆大胆领导生产
    把广大干部的革命积极性调动起来，是搞好春耕生产的一个重要问题。首都郊区广大贫下中农不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，运用阶级分析方法，正确地对待干部，做好干部的思想工作。
    延庆县康庄公社大营大队的贫下中农，学习了十六条和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论。一位贫农说：“对当权派必须进行阶级分析，要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路的当权派。如果核桃栗子一起数，不分好赖一锅端，很容易被阶级敌人钻空子。”他们按照毛主席的教导，用阶级分析的方法，识别干部，用一分为二的方法对待干部。经过分析，他们认为，这个大队的干部大多数是好的或比较好的，应该坚决依靠他们。党支部书记和大队长虽然有缺点、错误，只要他们认真检讨和改正错误，就应该对他们采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度，绝不能一棍子打死，一脚踢开。
    运动初期，这个大队有些贫下中农害怕打击报复，不敢给干部提意见。他们学习了《反对自由主义》和“老三篇”，打消了顾虑。他们认识到对犯错误的干部进行必要的批判、斗争，才能挽救他们，使他们不掉进修正主义泥坑。他们不但自己活学活用毛主席著作，还帮助干部学习，并针对干部的活思想做工作。在他们的帮助下，大队长“等着下台”的念头去掉了。
    农村基层干部在春耕生产中能不能挺起腰杆，决定性的一环是他们在文化大革命中能不能真正触及自己的灵魂，用毛泽东思想破私立公，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，和贫下中农一起，挑起革命、生产两副重担。
    农村文化大革命一开始，不少农村干部存在着种种顾虑。他们怕把农村搞乱，怕革命革到自己头上，对群众给他们贴大字报，有抵触和委屈情绪，有的人甚至等着“下台”。
    怀柔县庙城公社焦村大队大队长焦宝德，反复学习了毛主席的有关语录，思想上慢慢转过弯来，再看起大字报来，就没有什么抵触情绪了，反而觉得这是贫下中农对他最大的爱护和帮助。房山县赵各庄公社副主任王海，主动向贫下中农检查自己工作中的缺点。贫下中农说：“你能检查就好。”现在大家有事找他商量。这使王海十分感动。他说，只要相信群众，依靠群众，有了错误就检查改正，是会取得贫下中农谅解的。
    怀柔县茶坞公社东茶坞大队的副大队长六学“老三篇”，越学身上越出汗。他说，“私”字放在脑门里，越想越“吃亏”。“公”字刻在心坎上，就想不到“吃亏”“不吃亏”。毛主席把印把子交给咱，咱只有好好为贫下中农服务的义务，绝没有撂挑子不干的权利。
    建立生产班子落实春耕计划
    在党中央的“动员一切力量，立即为做好春耕生产而积极工作”的号召下，许多社、队建立了联合的生产班子领导春耕。
    密云县西田各庄公社贫下中农社员说得好，“抓革命，促生产”是毛主席他老人家的伟大号召，我们贫下中农一千个、一万个拥护，一千个、一万个坚决执行。西田各庄大队以及各生产队，通过协商，选派代表同一些群众信任的干部相结合，组成了领导春耕生产的班子。参加这个生产班子的成员，主动下地检查、了解春耕生产情况，然后同社员们一起制订生产计划，落实具体措施。生产班子成立半个多月来，全大队的水渠修整得差不多了，密云水库放水，就可以灌麦了。目前各生产队正在积极往大田送肥，有的队做到了人歇车不停。
    在我们访问过的一些大队或生产队，生产班子的成员都把春耕生产计划交给广大社员讨论，大大地调动了他们当家作主的积极性。房山县崇各庄公社岗上大队，往年的生产计划是由干部说了算。今年的耕种计划，是由社员民主讨论决定的，对全大队的农作物茬口作了全面合理的调整。贫农社员周永志对这一点十分满意，他说：“调整茬口是增产的一个重大措施，只要人勤肥足，今年大幅度增产是有把握的。”这个大队在制订今年的春耕生产计划时，社员们还提出了向远地、薄地多送肥的建议；目前已掀起一个向这些地块送肥的热潮，为今年增产打下基础。
