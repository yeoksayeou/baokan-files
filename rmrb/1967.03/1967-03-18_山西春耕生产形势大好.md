The great call of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production" has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The spring plowing production situation in Shanxi is excellent. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs have played a tremendous role. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. A large number of PLA soldiers have entered the production front lines, and various industries are actively supporting spring plowing.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 17 -- In the situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution, promoting production." Spring plowing production is presenting a very good situation. This is a new victory achieved by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely acting according to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province is in a very good situation and is getting better and better. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres have taken the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the fate of socialist construction into their own hands. They are determined to make every effort to do a good job in the first spring plowing after the Cultural Revolution. They have concentrated manpower, material resources, and financial resources, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," rapidly launching a spring plowing production high tide. At present, from Fenglingdu in the south to the Great Wall in the north, from the Hukou Pass in the east to the Yellow River in the west, the vast fields are bustling with activity. Farmers and cadres throughout the province have entered the spring plowing production front lines. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province is approximately 10% more than the same period last year, and most of it has already been delivered to the fields. Spring plowing land is being rapidly tilled and watered. Fertilizing, tilling, watering, and other work in the wheat fields are also being done well. In areas where the revolutionary masses have carried out the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize and hold power, the scale, order, and progress of production have all exceeded previous years. Xin County, the earliest area in the province to seize power, has increased the amount of fertilizer accumulated this year by 15% compared to the same period last year; land preparation, spring irrigation, and other work have all been done better than last year.

The first characteristic of the good spring plowing production situation in Shanxi at present is that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has armed the masses, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The great spiritual force has rapidly been transformed into great material force. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the province are using Mao Zedong Thought to transform both the objective world and the subjective world. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have been striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously promoting the revolutionization of their thinking. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have studied this document seriously and have been greatly inspired. They have expressed their determination: Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, and the Party Central Committee have called on us to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production and to do a good job in both. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee care so much about us, and we must redouble our efforts to strive for victory in both revolution and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Ping County in the Taihang Mountains have listened to the radio broadcast six times in a row. 86% of the production brigades in the county have quickly established leadership teams, grasped revolution, promoted production, and implemented production increase plans and measures. The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of the advanced agricultural unit Dazhai in the country were overjoyed and said: The letter from the Party Central Committee is like timely rain, like a mobilization order, and it has touched our hearts. We support it one thousand times and will carry it out ten thousand times, determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Another characteristic of the good spring plowing production situation in Shanxi's rural areas is that in places and units that need to seize power, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy has basically been implemented. Revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs have been established, and these leadership cores have played a tremendous role in "grasping revolution, promoting production."

After the establishment of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs in Shanxi Province, they have repeatedly emphasized to the people of the province the importance of "grasping revolution, promoting production" and have issued special notices to arrange and deploy spring plowing production. Subsequently, a large-scale "grasp revolution, promote production" rally was held in Taiyuan. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs at various levels have also sent batches of cadres to various places to propagate Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping revolution, promoting production," mobilizing local poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to grasp the opportunity to do a good job in spring plowing production with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and organizing various forces to support spring plowing. The Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters has dispatched 120 technical workers to the Jin Dongnan Region to carry out agricultural tool repair work, timely solving the problem of insufficient repair forces in the local area. The supply of fertilizers, small agricultural tools, and draft animals to rural areas has increased compared to the same period last year, effectively promoting the development of spring plowing production.

The third characteristic of the good spring plowing production situation in Shanxi is that a large number of PLA soldiers have entered the spring plowing front lines, helping local areas to grasp revolution and promote production, playing a tremendous role.

The Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi have responded to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call for the army to strongly support and help with spring plowing production, dispatching batches of soldiers to the spring plowing production front lines to help poor and lower-middle peasants do a good job in spring plowing. They are not only a powerful labor force but also an excellent propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. They have widely spread Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, accelerating the formation of the spring plowing production high tide. Under the leadership of the PLA, the broad masses of militiamen in various places have actively participated in spring plowing production, also playing a tremendous role in promoting spring plowing production.

The fourth characteristic of the good spring plowing production situation in Shanxi is that various industries are actively supporting the agricultural production front lines, ensuring the smooth progress of spring plowing production.

Last winter and this spring, the province has had little snow and rain, and it is urgent to repair agricultural machinery in time to cope with drought-affected spring plowing. The Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters has dispatched more than 400 workers with good political and technical qualities from more than 30 state-owned factories, mines, and enterprises to rural areas to support them. Some material departments have broken the rules by adopting the method of advance allocation, sending maintenance materials to rural areas in advance. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Jinan Region have also trained a large number of pesticide and agricultural machinery repairmen for the production teams of the communes, timely playing the role of agricultural machinery in drought-affected spring plowing.

So far, 470,000 small agricultural tools have been supplied to rural areas in various places, the amount of fertilizers has exceeded the same period last year, and the supply of draft animals has also increased compared to the same period last year. Now, a large number of materials supporting rural spring plowing are being transported continuously. The railway department has generally ensured that materials are transported as soon as they arrive, and the highway system has actively contacted the railway, agriculture, grain, and water conservancy departments to implement planned transportation, ensuring that there is no delay in agricultural work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should often propagate to the people the progressive situation of the world and the bright future, so that the people can establish the confidence of victory. At the same time, we should also tell the people, tell the comrades, that the road is tortuous. There are still many obstacles and difficulties on the road of revolution." "We and all the people unite and strive together, we must be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve the goal of victory." At present, the leading organs at various levels in Shanxi are, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, propagating the good situation to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres on the basis of summarizing the work of the previous period, further establishing the confidence of victory. At the same time, they also tell them about the difficulties on the road ahead and work together with them to overcome all difficulties and do a better job in spring plowing production.

Soldiers and community members from the Shanghai garrison and suburban communes are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" with practical actions. They are fighting side by side on the agricultural production front lines, launching a spring plowing production high tide. This is them digging a canal.

    毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召深入人心
    山西春耕生产形势大好
    革命的“三结合”临时权力机构发挥了巨大威力，广大贫下中农和革命干部挑起革命和生产两副重担，大批解放军指战员投入生产第一线，各行各业积极支援春耕
    新华社太原十七日电　在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，山西省广大贫下中农和农村革命干部坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，春耕生产呈现出一派大好形势。这是山西省广大贫下中农和农村革命干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照毛主席和党中央的指示办事取得的新胜利。
    目前，山西省的无产阶级文化大革命是一派大好形势，而且越来越好。广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义建设的命运掌握在自己手里，决心用最大的努力搞好文化大革命开展后的第一个春耕。他们集中人力、物力和财力，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速地掀起了春耕生产高潮。当前，南起风陵渡，北到长城边，东自娘子关，西至黄河岸，在广阔的田野上，到处热气腾腾。全省广大农民和干部已投入春耕生产第一线。全省积肥数量约比去年同期增加一成，并且大部分已送到田间。春播空地正在加紧耙耱保墒。麦田追肥、耙耱保墒、浇灌等工作也抓得较好。在无产阶级革命派实行革命的“三结合”夺权和掌权的地区，生产规模、生产秩序和生产进度都超过往年。全省夺权最早的忻县专区，今年积肥数量比去年同期增加百分之十五；整地、春浇等工作都比去年搞得好。
    山西当前春耕生产形势好的第一个特征是，在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想武装了群众，促进了人的思想革命化，巨大的精神力量迅速地转化成为巨大的物质力量。全省广大贫下中农和革命干部既以毛泽东思想改造客观世界，又以毛泽东思想改造主观世界。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们努力活学活用毛主席著作，不断地促进思想革命化。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》公布以后，广大贫下中农和革命干部认真学习这一文件，受到了巨大鼓舞。他们纷纷表示：我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席和党中央号召我们挑起革命、生产两副重担，把革命、生产都搞好。毛主席和党中央这样关心我们，我们一定要鼓足干劲，争取革命、生产双胜利。太行山区平顺县的贫下中农和社、队干部连续六次收听广播。全县百分之八十六的生产大队，很快地健全了领导班子，抓革命，促生产，落实了增产计划和增产措施。全国农业先进单位大寨大队的贫下中农和干部欢欣鼓舞地说：党中央的信是及时雨，是动员令，句句说到了我们的心坎上。我们一千个拥护，一万个执行，誓夺革命、生产双丰收。
    山西农村春耕生产形势好的另一个特征是，在需要夺权的地方和单位，基本上都实行了革命的“三结合”的方针。建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，这个领导核心在“抓革命，促生产”中发挥了巨大的作用。
    山西省革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构建立后，反复向全省人民强调指出“抓革命，促生产”的重要意义，并且专门发出通告，就春耕生产问题作了安排和部署。接着，在太原召开了规模较大的“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会。各级革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，还派出大批干部分赴各地宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，动员各地贫下中农和革命干部用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，不失时机地搞好春耕生产，并组织各方面力量支援春耕。山西革命造反总指挥部曾抽调一百二十名技术工人到晋东南专区进行农具修理工作，及时解决当地修理力量不足的困难。各地供应农村的化肥、小农具和耕畜，都比去年同期增多，有力地促进了春耕生产向前发展。
    山西春耕生产形势好的第三个特征是，大批人民解放军指战员投入春耕第一线，帮助各地抓革命，促生产，起了巨大作用。
    人民解放军山西军区和驻山西部队，响应毛主席和党中央关于军队大力支持、帮助春耕生产的号召，派出大批指战员到春耕生产第一线，帮助贫下中农搞好春耕。他们不仅是一支强大的劳动大军，而且是一支出色的毛泽东思想宣传队。他们广泛传播毛泽东思想，传播党的方针政策，有力地调动了广大贫下中农和基层干部的积极性和创造性，使春耕生产高潮加速形成。在解放军带动下，各地广大民兵积极投入春耕生产，对促进春耕生产也起了巨大作用。
    山西春耕生产形势好的第四个特征是，各行各业积极支援农业生产第一线，使春耕生产顺利进行。
    去冬今春全省少雪少雨，及时修理好农业机械对抗旱春耕是当务之急。山西革命造反总指挥部从三十多个国营厂矿企业抽调四百多名思想好、技术好的工人下乡支援。有的物资部门打破常规实行预拨的办法，提前把维修材料拨往农村。晋南专区的供销社还为公社生产队培训了一大批农药机械修理员，及时发挥了农业机械在抗旱春耕中的作用。
    到目前，已供应各地农村小农具四十七万多件，化肥数量已超过往年同期，供应耕畜数量也比去年同期增多。现在大量支援农村春耕的物资正在源源不断地赶运。铁路部门普遍作到随到随运，公路系统主动与铁路、农业、粮食和水利等部门联系，实行计划运输，保证不误农时。
    毛主席教导说：“我们应当把世界进步的情况和光明的前途，常常向人民宣传，使人民建立起胜利的信心。同时，我们还要告诉人民，告诉同志们，道路是曲折的。在革命的道路上还有许多障碍物，还有许多困难。”“我们和全体人民团结起来，共同努力，一定能够排除万难，达到胜利的目的。”目前，山西各级领导部门正按照毛主席的教导，在总结前一段工作的基础上，向广大贫下中农和革命干部宣传大好形势，进一步树立起胜利的信心。同时，也把前进道路中的困难告诉他们，同他们一道去排除万难，把春耕生产搞得更好。（附图片）
    驻沪部队指战员和郊区公社社员，用实际行动响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。他们并肩战斗在农业生产第一线，掀起春耕生产高潮。这是他们在修水渠。
