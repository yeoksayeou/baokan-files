	Chairman Mao said: "To make a revolution, one needs a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the principles and style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people in defeating imperialism and its running dogs."

	The Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party was established. It advocates the overthrow of the capitalist system through violence and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The conference sends warm revolutionary greetings to Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao.

	BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Vienna, the Austrian Marxist-Leninists held a conference in Vienna on February 12, announcing the establishment of the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party and electing the party's Central Committee. Comrade Franz Strober was elected as the First Secretary.

	The conference pointed out that the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party was established because the Austrian Communist Party has become a revisionist organization in the style of the Social Democratic Party.

	The conference emphasized that the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party advocates the overthrow of the capitalist system through violence and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The conference expressed that the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party will, together with the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labor of Albania, and other Marxist-Leninist parties, oppose imperialism and revisionism, and proudly regard itself as a student of the teachings of the contemporary outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong.

	The conference also adopted a telegram of greetings to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, signed by Franz Strober, the First Secretary of the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	"The founding conference of the Austrian Marxist-Leninist Party sends warm revolutionary greetings to our most beloved and wise leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, to the glorious Communist Party of China, and to all the Chinese people who are determined to carry the socialist revolution to final victory!

		Down with imperialism! Wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism!

		Long live the great socialist bulwark — China!

		Long live the glorious Communist Party of China, the powerful vanguard of the world revolutionary movement!

		Long live the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong!"
