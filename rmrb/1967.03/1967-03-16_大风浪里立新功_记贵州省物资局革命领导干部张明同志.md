In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which touches the souls of people, whether or not a cadre dares to stand up and support the revolutionary masses, dare to fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and dare to actively support and participate in the united struggle for seizing power by the revolutionary masses, is an important indicator of whether they can establish new merits for the Party and the people. Comrade Zhang Ming, former deputy director of the Guizhou Provincial Materials Management Bureau, has set a good example in this regard.

Actively Supporting the Revolutionary Masses

The great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A large number of revolutionary youth and masses quickly rose up to fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. At this time, the question was whether to stand at the forefront supporting and leading them, or to stand behind them criticizing them, or to stand against them opposing them. Every cadre faced this stern test.

In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses in the Guiyang area resolutely launched an attack against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the provincial and municipal Party committees. Those bourgeois lords feared and hated the revolutionary actions of the masses. They distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, suppressed the revolutionary masses, and implemented white terror. At a time when the counter-revolutionary forces were rampant, a handful of bad elements in the Provincial Materials Bureau labeled some revolutionary youth as "counter-revolutionaries." At this time, Comrade Zhang Ming, who had just returned from an out-of-town assignment, promptly saw through the enemy's plot. He broke through numerous obstacles and went to those revolutionary pioneers who had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," firmly grasping their hands and saying excitedly, "I won't be the deputy director anymore, I'll work with you! We have Chairman Mao backing us, what are we afraid of! To defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, even if we sacrifice ourselves, it is a worthy death." These words of steel gave the revolutionary masses great encouragement at that time.

As a revolutionary cadre, support for the revolutionary masses must not stop at mere words; one must join the battle as a fighter and fully utilize one's political maturity, organizational abilities, and rich experience in struggle to actively promote the revolutionary struggle.

When revolutionary fighting organizations emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, Comrade Zhang Ming, as a fighter, suggested to the revolutionary organizations: "We must support each other and fight together." He told the revolutionary masses, "Five fingers spread out to hit someone is not powerful; only by closing the five fingers into a fist and hitting out can one have strength." At the crucial moment of the revolutionary masses' united struggle for seizing power, Comrade Zhang Ming again suggested to the revolutionary organizations: "We must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and pay attention to uniting with the majority of cadres and masses." He also actively helped the revolutionary factions study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcome selfish thoughts, and achieved the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the materials system, laying a good foundation for the subsequent struggle for seizing power.

Comrade Zhang Ming believed that revolutionary cadres must have a clear banner and a firm stance when supporting the revolutionary masses and must not muddle through or smooth things over. If both opposing factions make demands of you and you agree to both, appearing impartial on the surface, you are actually suppressing and attacking the revolutionary masses. This is how he dealt with the unreasonable demands made by the "conservative" faction: "I absolutely cannot have one foot in each boat. If you are revolutionary, I support you; if you are not revolutionary, I do not support you; if you rebel against me, I still do not support you." Comrade Zhang Ming's proletarian stance was very clear.

Firmly Defending Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Zhang Ming proved with his actions that a revolutionary cadre must not only support the activities of the revolutionary masses but must also stand up and resolutely fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Zhang Ming had fought against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Therefore, the class enemy hated him to death. As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, they wanted Comrade Zhang Ming to "focus on production," attempting to exclude him from the movement. However, Comrade Zhang Ming quickly saw through their plot and bravely stood with the masses, launching a fierce attack with the revolutionary masses against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, exposing and criticizing their various crimes.

At this time, the class enemy became even more panicked. To silence Comrade Zhang Ming, they used their usurped power to implement bourgeois dictatorship against him. They viciously labeled Comrade Zhang Ming as a "third-class cadre" and his wife as a "monster and demon." Comrade Zhang Ming was not intimidated by the enemy's counter-revolutionary arrogance. He encouraged his wife, saying, "What are you afraid of! Revolution does not fear death, fearing death is not revolutionary, at most you lose a head! But we must not lose Mao Zedong Thought!" This is the voice of a proletarian revolutionary loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!

The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party were not willing to perish. They instructed their henchmen to launch multiple attacks on Comrade Zhang Ming. Once, they took advantage of Comrade Zhang Ming's relapse of stomach disease, when he could not eat, and subjected him to a brutal struggle session. They falsely accused Comrade Zhang Ming of supporting the revolutionary masses in sealing black materials, forcing him to admit his "mistake." Someone threatened, "If you say again that supporting them is correct, we will hang you!" At this time, Comrade Zhang Ming replied, "To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, being hanged by you is glorious!"

Seeing that their attacks were ineffective, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Materials Bureau went all out, shouting at Comrade Zhang Ming, "Where is your party spirit?" Comrade Zhang Ming angrily retorted, "You have labeled so many revolutionary masses as 'counter-revolutionaries,' committed so many anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, what party spirit do you have?!" The class enemy's fierce counterattacks did not shake Comrade Zhang Ming's resolute will to fight.

Definitely Seize the Great Power into the Hands of the Proletariat

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. With power, one has everything; without power, one loses everything. Comrade Zhang Ming, through his struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, deeply understood this. In the past, within the Materials Bureau, he insisted on principles and acted according to Mao Zedong Thought. However, his correct opinions were almost never adopted; they were all opposed and he was subjected to exclusion and attacks, while erroneous things were rampant. What was the reason for this? Comrade Zhang Ming gradually understood that the power in the Materials Bureau was not in the hands of the proletariat but had been usurped by the representatives of the bourgeoisie who had infiltrated the Party. Therefore, although he was also a Party committee member and deputy director, in reality, he only had an empty title without real power. Thus, to make Mao Zedong Thought occupy the Materials Bureau, the issue of power must be resolved.

Because Comrade Zhang Ming recognized the importance of seizing power, he actively participated in the "three-in-one combination" struggle for seizing power within the bureau and the province.

The class enemy was most afraid of the genuine representatives of the broad revolutionary masses, the representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary cadres implementing the "three-in-one combination" to seize power. Before the revolutionary factions seized power, the handful of elements within the Materials Bureau spread rumors, slandered, created chaos, and exhausted their efforts to fabricate black materials against Comrade Zhang Ming, spreading them everywhere, attempting to confuse the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution, between proletarian power-holders and power-holders taking the capitalist road, directing the spearhead at revolutionary cadres, aiming to achieve their counter-revolutionary goal of "if you want to overthrow, overthrow us all; if you want to drown, drown us all." However, the proletarian revolutionary factions within the Materials Bureau firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They resolutely supported Comrade Zhang Ming's participation in the struggle for seizing power.

Why was the old Red Army soldier Comrade Zhang Ming able to pass one test after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and establish new merits for the Party and the people? He modestly said, "I have no special abilities; I only did some things according to Chairman Mao's teachings." Because Comrade Zhang Ming resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, dared to stand at the forefront of the movement, and worked with the masses to expose monsters and demons, he deeply earned the trust of the masses and is now elected as a vice chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

Long live the united struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions!

    大风浪里立新功
    ——记贵州省物资局革命领导干部张明同志
    在触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，一切领导干部，敢不敢站出来支持无产阶级革命派，敢不敢同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，敢不敢积极支持并参加无产阶级革命派的联合夺权斗争，是他们能否为党、为人民建立新功劳的重要标志。原贵州省物资管理局副局长张明同志，在这方面树立了良好的榜样。
                积极支持无产阶级革命派
    伟大统帅毛主席亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。一大批革命青少年和革命群众很快起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开斗争。这时，是站在他们的前头支持并领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每一个领导干部都面临这种严峻的考验。
    无产阶级文化大革命初期，贵阳地区的革命群众坚决地向省、市委内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动了进攻。对于群众的革命行动，那班资产阶级老爷们怕得要死，恨得要命，他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命群众，实行白色恐怖。在反革命势力猖獗一时的时候，省物资局一小撮坏家伙，把这个局里一些革命青年打成“反革命”。这时，刚从外地出差回来的张明同志，及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋。他冲破重重阻力，走到那些被打成“反革命”的革命闯将中去，紧紧握住他们的手激动地说：“我的副局长不当了，跟你们一起干！我们有毛主席撑腰，怕什么！为捍卫毛泽东思想，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是牺牲了，也是死得其所。”这些叮当响的话，当时给了革命群众很大的鼓舞。
    作为一个革命的领导干部，对无产阶级革命派的支持绝对不能停留在口头上，必须以战斗员的身份加入战斗的行列，而且要充分发挥自己政治上比较成熟、组织能力较强、斗争经验比较丰富等特长，积极推动革命斗争。
    当革命的战斗组织如雨后春笋一样出现的时候，张明同志就以一个战斗员的身份，向革命组织建议：要互相支援，联合作战。他对革命群众说：“五个指头伸开打人，是没有力量的，只有把五个指头收回来，握成拳头，打过去才有劲。”在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的关键时刻，张明同志又向革命组织建议：要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，注意团结干部和群众中的大多数。他还主动地帮助革命派活学活用毛主席著作，克服私心杂念，实现了物资系统无产阶级革命派的大联合，为后来的夺权斗争奠定了良好的基础。
    张明同志认为，革命的领导干部在支持无产阶级革命派的时候，必须旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，不能和稀泥，抹光墙。如果对立的两派都向你提出要求，而你都答应，表面上是不偏不倚，其实还是压制和打击了无产阶级革命派。他就是这样对待保字派向他提出的无理要求的：“我绝不能脚踏两只船。你是革命的，我就支持；你是不革命的，我就不支持；你造我的反，我还是不支持。”张明同志的无产阶级立场是十分鲜明的。
                坚决捍卫毛泽东思想
    张明同志用行动证明，一个革命领导干部，仅仅是支持无产阶级革命派的活动还不够，还必须挺身而出，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行坚决斗争。
    张明同志在文化大革命以前，就同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行过斗争。因此，阶级敌人对他恨得要死，无产阶级文化大革命一开始，就要张明同志“专抓生产”，企图把他排斥在运动之外。但是，张明同志很快识破了他们的阴谋，勇敢地站到群众中去，和革命群众一起，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动了猛烈的进攻，揭发、批判他们的种种罪行。
    这时，阶级敌人更加惊慌。他们为了封住张明同志的口，便利用窃踞的职权，对他实行了资产阶级专政。他们卑鄙地把张明同志划为“三类干部”，把他的爱人定为“牛鬼蛇神”。张明同志没有被敌人的反革命气焰所吓倒。他鼓励爱人说：“怕什么！革命不怕死，怕死不革命，顶多丢一个脑袋！但是，绝不能把毛泽东思想丢掉！”这就是无产阶级革命战士忠于毛泽东思想的心声！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是不甘心灭亡的，他们又指使自己的亲信对张明同志进行了多次围攻。一次，他们趁张明同志胃病复发，不能吃饭的时候，对他进行了残酷的围斗。他们胡说什么张明同志支持无产阶级革命派封黑材料是错误的，强迫他承认“错误”。有人威胁说：“你再要说支持他们是对的，我们就绞死你！”这时，张明同志回答说：“为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，被你们绞死了是光荣的！”
    物资局里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派看到围攻无济于事，便赤膊上阵，对张明同志拍着桌子叫道：“你的党性哪里去了？！”张明同志愤怒地反驳说：“你们把那么多革命群众打成了‘反革命’，犯下了那么多反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，还有什么党性可言？！”阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，丝毫没有动摇张明同志坚决斗争的意志。
              一定要把大权夺到无产阶级手里来
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失了一切。张明同志在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，更加深刻地体会到了这一点。过去在物资局里，他坚持原则，按毛泽东思想办事。但是，他的正确意见几乎没有一次被采纳，都被反对掉了，并受到了排斥和打击，而错误的东西却大肆泛滥。这究竟是什么原因呢？张明同志逐渐明白了，那就是物资局的权不是掌握在无产阶级手里，而被混进党内的资产阶级代表人物篡夺了。所以尽管自己也是党委委员、副局长，而实际上只有虚名，没有实权。因此，要使毛泽东思想占领物资局这个阵地，必须解决政权问题。
    由于张明同志认识了夺权的重要，便积极地参加了局里和省里的“三结合”联合夺权斗争。
    阶级敌人最害怕真正代表广大革命群众的革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表和革命的领导干部实行“三结合”夺权。物资局里一小撮家伙在革命派夺权之前即刮阴风，放暗箭，造谣污蔑，制造混乱，挖空心思地整了张明同志的黑材料，并到处散布，企图混淆革命和反革命的界限，混淆无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的界限，把矛头指向革命的领导干部，以达到他们“要打倒就一起打倒，要下水就一起下水”的反革命目的。但是，物资局里的无产阶级革命派牢牢地记住了毛主席的教导：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他们坚决地支持了张明同志参加夺权斗争。
    老红军战士张明同志为什么能在文化大革命中经受住一个又一个的考验，为党和人民立下了新的功劳呢？他自己谦逊地说：“我没有什么本事，我只不过按照毛主席的教导，做了一些事情。”由于张明同志坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，“敢”字当头，站在运动的前面，和群众一起，揭露牛鬼蛇神，所以他深得群众的信任，现在已被推选为贵州省革命委员会副主任委员。
                                    本报记者（附图片）
    无产阶级革命派联合起来！
