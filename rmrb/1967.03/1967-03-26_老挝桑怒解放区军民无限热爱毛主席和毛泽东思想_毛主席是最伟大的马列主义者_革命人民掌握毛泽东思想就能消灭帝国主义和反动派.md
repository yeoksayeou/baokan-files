The military and people of the Sanne Liberation Zone in Laos, who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, deeply love the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Everywhere in the Sanne Liberation Zone, one can see many heroic soldiers and cadres of the Lao People's Liberation Army studying Chairman Mao's works earnestly under the flickering light of oil lamps in caves, under bamboo shelters, in the jungle, and at the foot of mountains. They firmly believe that as long as the revolutionary people of the whole world arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, imperialism and all reactionaries will surely be defeated.

A responsible person from the local forces of Sanne Province said, "I strive to study Chairman Mao's works, learn and apply them, and carry the revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people and also the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. We, the soldiers and cadres of the Pathet Lao, deeply love Chairman Mao."

Lao People's Liberation Army cadre Suva said, "Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time. We, the military and people of Laos, deeply love Chairman Mao."

A cadre from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front said, "Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path to victory for the Lao people and also illuminates the path to liberation for the oppressed people of all countries."

A cadre from the Sanne Liberation Zone, Chanphong, said, "When I encounter difficulties, I take out Chairman Mao's photo to look at, and study Chairman Mao's works. This gives me boundless strength to overcome all difficulties."

A platoon leader in the Liberation Army, Tongpan, said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist, the great leader of the revolutionary people of all countries. He leads the 700 million Chinese people in resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work 'Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society' repeatedly and earnestly, I said, 'This work not only fits the Chinese situation but also fits the Lao situation. I will revolutionize for life and study Mao Zedong Thought for life.'"

Liberation Army soldier Kanphong said, "I will definitely take 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' as the highest directive and serve the Party and the people for life."

A responsible person from Sanne Province often carries Chairman Mao's works with him, and no matter where he goes, he always seizes the time to study them earnestly and uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide his work.

The brave fighting military and people of Laos deeply understand and are greatly inspired by Chairman Mao's profound judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Young soldier Xianping said, "On the surface, U.S. imperialism seems very powerful, but in reality, it is a paper tiger. Our struggle in Laos has proven that Chairman Mao's profound judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is absolutely correct. As long as we are not afraid of them, dare to fight them, and are good at fighting them, we can defeat them. We should recognize the enemy from its essence and not be intimidated by its apparent strength." He said, "Chairman Mao is completely correct, 'The people of the whole world must have the courage to fight, not fear difficulties, and advance bravely. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people.'"

Platoon leader Tongpan said, "We, the patriotic military and people of Laos, are fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and achieving continuous victories. Just as Chairman Mao said, U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. We are full of confidence in defeating the enemy and achieving the final victory of the Lao revolution."

The soldiers and cadres of the Lao People's Liberation Army enthusiastically praise and actively apply Chairman Mao's military thoughts. A responsible person from a certain military school said, "After studying Chairman Mao's military thoughts, we understand that we should fight annihilation battles. After practical application, it has been very successful." The head of the military research office, Gaxi, said, "We, the patriotic military and people of Laos, deeply love Chairman Mao and respect Mao Zedong Thought. Our students are studying Chairman Mao's military thoughts, the theory of people's war, and the thoughts on fighting annihilation battles. Chairman Mao pointed out, 'It is better to cut off one finger than to injure ten.' This is very wise and correct. I will study Chairman Mao's works well and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm the soldiers. An army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is fearless of hardships and death and is invincible."

    老挝桑怒解放区军民无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想
    毛主席是最伟大的马列主义者
    革命人民掌握毛泽东思想就能消灭帝国主义和反动派
    新华社康开电　正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇战斗的老挝桑怒解放区军民，无限热爱全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    在桑怒解放区到处都可以看到，许多屡建奇功的老挝解放军指战员和干部，在煤油灯光闪闪的石洞里，在竹棚下，在丛林中，在山脚下，认真学习毛主席著作的动人情景。他们表示坚信，只要全世界革命人民都用毛泽东思想武装起来，那么帝国主义和各国反动派通通都会被消灭。
    桑怒省地方部队一位负责人说：“我努力学习毛主席的著作，学了就用，活学活用，革命到底。毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。我们巴特寮战士和干部无限热爱毛主席。”
    老挝人民解放军干部苏瓦说：“毛主席是当代的列宁，我们老挝军民无限热爱毛主席。”
    老挝爱国战线党中央的一位干部说：“毛泽东思想照亮了老挝人民争取胜利的道路，也照亮了世界各国被压迫人民求解放的道路。”
    桑怒解放区的一位机关干部占冯说：“当我碰到困难的时候，我就拿出毛主席的照片看一看，就学习毛主席的著作，我就会增加无限的力量，决心克服一切困难。”
    解放军一位名叫通潘的班长说：“毛主席是最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是世界各国革命人民的伟大领袖，他领导着七亿中国人民坚决支援世界各国革命人民的革命斗争。”他反复地认真学习了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇光辉著作以后说：“这篇著作不仅适合中国情况，而且也适合老挝的情况。我要干一辈子革命，学习一辈子毛泽东思想。”
    解放军战士坎朋说：“我一定要以毛主席的著作《为人民服务》为最高指示，为党为人民服务一辈子。”
    桑怒省一位负责人经常随身携带毛主席著作，无论走到哪里，总要抓紧时间专心一意地学习，并且用毛泽东思想来指导自己的工作。
    正在英勇战斗的老挝爱国军民，对毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断体会得很深刻，也从中受到极大鼓舞。年青战士香平说：“从表面上看美帝国主义似乎很强大，但实际上它是纸老虎。我们老挝人民的斗争，证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这一英明论断非常正确。只要不怕它们，敢于和它们斗争，善于和它们斗争，就能打败它们。对敌人应该从本质上去认识它，不能被它的表面强大所吓倒”。他说，“毛主席说的完全正确，‘全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。’”解放军班长通潘说：“我们老挝爱国军民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争，不断取得胜利。正如毛主席所说的，美帝国主义就是纸老虎。我们对战胜敌人，取得老挝革命的最后胜利，充满了信心。”
    老挝解放军指战员都热烈赞扬和积极运用毛主席的军事思想。某军事学校一位负责人说：“经过学习毛泽东主席的军事思想，我们懂得了要打歼灭战。经过实际运用，很成功。”这个学校的军事教研室主任嘎西说：“我们老挝爱国军民无限热爱毛主席，敬仰毛泽东思想。我们的学员正在学习毛泽东主席的军事思想，学习毛主席关于人民战争的理论以及打歼灭战的思想。毛主席指出，“伤其十指不如断其一指”，这是非常英明正确的。我要好好学习毛主席著作，要用毛泽东思想教育战士，武装战士。用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，不怕苦，不怕死，是无坚不克的。”
