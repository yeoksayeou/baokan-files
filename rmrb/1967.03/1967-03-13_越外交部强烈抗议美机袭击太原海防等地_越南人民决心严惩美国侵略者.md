	Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests U.S. Air Raids on Taiyuan, Haiphong, and Other Places
	Vietnamese People Resolved to Punish U.S. Aggressors
	U.S. Bandit Planes Bomb Hanoi City Again

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 11 — The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on March 11 strongly protesting the U.S. aircraft's repeated attacks on Taiyuan City, the Taiyuan Steel Plant, Hongki City, and industrial facilities in Quang Ninh and Hai Phong provinces on March 10 and 11. The statement also condemned the launching of missiles into residential areas of Hai Phong, killing and injuring many innocent people, as new heinous crimes.

	The statement said: "The more crimes the U.S. imperialists commit against the Vietnamese people, the more hatred they arouse, and the more resolute the Vietnamese people are to punish them. The more the U.S. aggressors escalate the war, the more shameful their defeat will be!"

	The statement demands that the U.S. government must immediately, permanently, and unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; must immediately stop the war of aggression against Vietnam; must withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppets from South Vietnam; and must allow the Vietnamese people to settle their own affairs.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 12 — On March 12, U.S. imperialism brazenly dispatched aircraft to bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, dropping bombs along the Red River in the city.

	This is a serious act of war "escalation" by the U.S. bandits following their consecutive bombing of Hai Phong, the second-largest city in North Vietnam, and the important industrial city of Taiyuan on March 10 and 11. It is a new heinous crime committed by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people. On March 12, multiple batches of U.S. aircraft also bombed and strafed residential areas and economic facilities in some provinces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
