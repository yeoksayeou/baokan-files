The ominous opening of the Guam conference

Johnson and Nguyen Van Thieu sing in unison, clamoring to expand the war

New China News Agency, March 20th: Guam, news: U.S. President Johnson, accompanied by a group of military and political leaders, arrived in Guam today and immediately began a meeting with the U.S. commander in South Vietnam, Westmoreland, the U.S. "ambassador" to Saigon, Lodge, and the South Vietnamese puppet leaders Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu to plot the expansion of the war in Vietnam.

Upon arriving in Guam, Johnson stepped off the plane and immediately gave a speech, declaring that the Guam conference would discuss the progress of the U.S. "military efforts" and future policies. When Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu arrived, he reiterated the U.S. "commitment" to "defend Vietnam." Nguyen Van Thieu, this traitorous clown, also slavishly echoed his American master, shouting: "We will win this war together."

While advocating for the expansion of the war in Vietnam, Johnson did not forget to use "peace" rhetoric, desperately trying to cover up this war conference. He claimed that the conference would "attempt to assess the prospects for a peaceful resolution to Vietnam."

It is indeed difficult for the American imperialists to portray such a gathering of murderers as a quest for peace. Even prominent figures in the U.S. ruling class, such as Senate Democratic Leader Mansfield and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright, find it hard to avoid the warlike nature of this conference. Mansfield admitted in a speech on the 20th that the Guam conference might make "very important military decisions," and "we cannot rule out the possibility of escalating the war." On the same day, Fulbright, in a television interview, bluntly stated that he believed the Johnson administration was seeking the enemy's surrender, not "negotiations." He revealed that the Guam conference might decide to "significantly increase" forces in Vietnam, thereby intensifying pressure on the Vietnamese people.

Meanwhile, Western media continued to report that Johnson would make further decisions to expand the war at the Guam conference to achieve his arrogant goal of "forcing surrender through war." The British Daily Mirror reported from New York on the 20th: "Johnson will order a more intense prosecution of the Vietnam War in Guam," and "now Johnson is ready to take this gamble: hoping that military force can bring the war as close to resolution as possible."

It was announced that the conference, convened by Johnson to expand the war in Vietnam, is scheduled to last two days. U.S. news agencies revealed that on the first day of the conference, Westmoreland reported on the military situation of the U.S. war in Vietnam.

    杀气腾腾的关岛会议开场
    约翰逊和阮文绍一唱一和叫嚣扩大战争
    新华社二十日讯　关岛消息：美国总统约翰逊率领一帮军政头目，今天到达关岛，并随即开始同从西贡赶到的侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰、美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇及南越傀儡头目阮高其、阮文绍等举行策划扩大侵越战争的会议。
    约翰逊在到达关岛时，一下飞机就发表谈话，叫嚷关岛会议将讨论美国的“军事努力的进展以及将来的方针”，并且在阮高其、阮文绍等到达时，重申了美国“决心保卫越南”的“保证”，阮文绍这个卖国小丑也奴颜婢膝地跟着他的美国主子狂叫：“我们将一起打赢这场战争”。
    在鼓吹扩大侵越战争的同时，约翰逊没有忘记玩弄“和平”词句，竭力为这次战争会议施放烟幕。他扬言，会议“将试图估计一下通过体面的解决，使越南实现和平的希望”。
    美帝国主义者要把这样一个杀人凶犯的集会说成是为了谋求和平，这毕竟是太困难了，连美国参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德、参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特等美国统治集团的头面人物，也觉得难于回避这次会议的战争性质。曼斯菲尔德二十日在一次谈话中承认，关岛会议可能作出“十分重要的军事决定”，“我们不能排除战争升级的可能性”。同一天，富布赖特在一次电视谈话中，更是直言不讳地说，他认为，约翰逊政府要求的是对方的投降，而不是什么“和谈”。他透露，关岛会议可能作出“大大增加”侵越兵力的决定，从而加强对越南人民的“压力”。
    与此同时，西方报刊继续透露，约翰逊将在关岛会议上作出进一步扩大战争的决定，以实现“以战迫降”的狂妄企图。英国《每日镜报》二十日从纽约发出报道说：“约翰逊将在关岛命令更猛烈地进行越南战争”，“现在约翰逊准备下这样的赌注：指望军事力量能使战争尽可能接近于解决”。
    据宣布，约翰逊召集的这次扩大侵越战争的会议预定进行两天。美国通讯社透露，在第一天的会议上，威斯特摩兰汇报了美国侵越战争的军事局势。
