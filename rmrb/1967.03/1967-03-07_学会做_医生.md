Title: Learning to Be a "Doctor"

Every revolutionary comrade must learn to be a "doctor."

We are all revolutionaries, so why must we learn to be "doctors"?

The "doctors" we are talking about here refer to those who can treat ideological and political "illnesses."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our main target is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. During the movement, we have exposed various errors committed by some leading cadres. These cadres have, to varying degrees, been infected by bourgeois ideology and have fallen "ill." Some have superficial "illnesses," some have deep-seated "illnesses," and a few are almost "beyond cure." How should we treat these "patients"?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In dealing with ideological and political diseases, we must not adopt a rough-and-ready attitude. We must adopt the attitude of 'curing the sickness to save the patient,' which is the only correct and effective method."

"Deciding not to adopt a rough-and-ready attitude" means we must understand the "symptoms" and distinguish right from wrong. We must not, just because they have made mistakes, indiscriminately condemn, reject, or overthrow them without distinguishing between right and wrong.

"Adopting the attitude of 'curing the sickness to save the patient'" means we must be benevolent and prescribe the right medicine. If it is typhoid, we must use medicine; if it is appendicitis, we must operate. As long as they are sincere in seeking treatment and willing to correct their mistakes, we must welcome them and cure their "illnesses," turning them into good comrades. This way, after curing typhoid, they can develop immunity; after removing the appendix, they can be cured. This enables them to make new efforts and achieve new merits in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

"Learning from the past to avoid future mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient" is Chairman Mao's consistent policy towards cadres who have made mistakes. This policy has played an immense role in our Party's various political movements. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is being deeply understood and firmly implemented by the broad masses of revolutionaries. For example, in some units, leading cadres, under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, have said and done wrong things. Revolutionary masses have conducted necessary and serious exposure and criticism of their errors. When they seriously examined their mistakes and stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses welcomed their transformation, and some were even absorbed into revolutionary mass organizations and the "three-in-one" leadership core.

If there are mistakes, criticize them; if there is correction, welcome them—this is the attitude of "curing the sickness to save the patient."

Of course, on the one hand, we must learn to be "doctors," helping all comrades who are willing to revolutionize; on the other hand, we must be vigilant against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, using "curing the sickness to save the patient" as an excuse to negate and evade the criticism and struggle of the revolutionary masses, negate the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and launch new counterattacks. Against such counterattacks, we must resolutely fight back!

### 学会做“医生”

    学会做“医生”
    飞虹
    我们每一个革命同志，都必须学会做“医生”。
    我们都是干革命的，为什么一定要学会做“医生”呢？
    这里所说的要学会做“医生”，指的是要学会治思想上和政治上的“病”。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们斗争的重点是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在运动中也揭发了一些领导干部中存在的这样或那样的错误。这些干部在不同程度上被资产阶级思想侵蚀了，害了“病”。他们有的是“病”在表皮，有的是“病”入内脏，还有少数快要“病”入骨髓了。对于这样一些“病人”，我们应该采取什么态度呢？毛主席教导我们说：“对待思想上的毛病和政治上的毛病，决不能采用鲁莽的态度，必须采用‘治病救人’的态度，才是正确有效的方法。”
    “决不能采用鲁莽的态度”，就是要弄清“病情”，分清是非。决不能因为他们有了毛病，就不分青红皂白，采取一概否定，一概排斥，一概打倒的态度。
    “必须采用‘治病救人’的态度”，就是要与人为善，对症下药。是伤寒，就得用药；是阑尾炎，就得开刀。只要他们“老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”这样，治好了伤寒，可以产生免疫力；割掉了阑尾，也就可以断根。这就能使他们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中作出新的努力，立下新的功劳。
    “惩前毖后、治病救人”，这是毛主席对待犯错误干部的一贯的政策。这个政策，在我们党的历次政治运动中，发挥了无穷的威力。在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，也正在被广大的革命群众所深切理解，坚决执行。比如有些单位的领导干部，在资产阶级反动路线的影响下，说了一些错话，做了一些错事。革命群众对他们的错误进行了必要的、严肃的揭发和批判。当他们认真检查了自己的错误，站到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来之后，革命群众对他们的这种转变，采取了欢迎的态度，有的还被吸收参加了革命群众组织和“三结合”的领导核心。
    有错误，就批判；有改正，就欢迎——这就是“治病救人”的态度。
    当然，我们一方面要学会做
    “医生”，帮助一切愿意革命的同志；另一方面，还要警惕党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派钻空子，以“治病救人”为借口，否定和逃避革命群众的批判斗争，否定无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就，进行新的反扑。对于这种反扑，我们必须坚决打退！
