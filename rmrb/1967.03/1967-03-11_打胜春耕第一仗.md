The drums of the Sī Xiángchūn battle resound,
The songs ring out loud and clear.
The poor and lower-middle peasants carry the banner,
Revolutionary cadres take the lead.
People come and go like shuttles,
Iron hoes swing with a thunderous roar.
Dug wells, opened canals, and terraced fields,
Built embankments, tested seeds, and rushed to fertilize.
Silver hoes shake the mountains,
Layer upon layer of terraced fields stand in rows.
Iron shoulders carry away the rocky slopes,
To make the rocky slopes yield grain.
Mighty hands guide water around the fields,
Clear canals ripple with waves.
The commune has the power to turn things around,
The commune members are even stronger than Yu Gong.
The "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are kept in the bosom,
The leader's call is never forgotten.
Grasp the revolution, promote production,
Win the first battle of spring plowing!

    打胜春耕第一仗
    司祥春战鼓咚咚敲，歌声多嘹亮。贫下中农扛大旗，革命干部带头上。人来人往如穿梭，铁锨挥动震天响。打井开渠修梯田，筑埂试种送肥忙。银锄震撼万重山，层层梯田排成行。铁肩挑走乱石坡，要叫石坡献米粮。巨手引水绕田转，清渠扬波千层浪。公社自有回天力，社员更比愚公强。《毛主席语录》怀中揣，领袖的号召永不忘。抓革命，促生产，打胜春耕第一仗！
