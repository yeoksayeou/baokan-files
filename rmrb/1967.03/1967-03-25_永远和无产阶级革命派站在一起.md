The People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao, is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this fierce class struggle, it is our glorious historical mission for the people's army to bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, enthusiastically support the revolutionary leftist masses, and severely strike down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

All the cadres and soldiers of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military District have always firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With boundless enthusiasm and wholeheartedly, we have supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, split and dissolved the conservative forces, resolutely suppressed the counter-revolutionary organizations' counterattacks, and in the struggle to implement the "three-in-one combination" by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we have actively carried out our combat missions.

I

Chairman Mao said: "You should concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" In the process of supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the Party Committee of the provincial military district first strengthened its own ideological revolutionization, forming a united and fighting core, with unified thinking and consistent actions, leading the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

In the course of struggle, we deeply felt: closely following Chairman Mao, closely following the Party Central Committee, closely following the Central Military Commission, closely following the Central Cultural Revolution Group, in the struggle to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and to correctly treat ourselves, is the fundamental guarantee for the army to support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Whenever a new thing appears or a new problem arises, we all sit together, open our minds, discuss views, express opinions, raise questions, and have thorough discussions, and then make unanimous decisions. In the early stage of the movement, when the masses began to rise up, we had thorough discussions on the issue of whether to intervene or not. Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we deeply realized that in such a severe class struggle, not taking any action or standing by is wrong, and we must actively and proactively shoulder the combat mission of defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Thus, through the Military Affairs Department, militia, guard units, and other channels, we investigated the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, kept abreast of the movements of various political forces at all times; sent a large number of personnel to go deep among the masses, extensively contact society, conduct investigations and research, distinguish between enemies and friends, and maintain high vigilance; when the movement further deepened and the lines of struggle between the two lines and the two roads became clear, we used Chairman Mao's method of class analysis to specially discuss the political attitudes of influential mass organizations. This made us clearly understand that we must firmly stand on the side of the leftist masses, stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and give the leftist masses help within our abilities. For conservative organizations, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, in accordance with the principle of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," carried out criticism and help. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the crucial stage of seizing power, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to the entire army to actively support the broad leftist masses. We immediately stood up and, with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, implemented the "three-in-one combination" and, in one fell swoop, seized all power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fulfilling our due responsibilities.

II

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." In practice, we deeply felt: going deep among the masses and being with the masses is the prerequisite for supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat; if we do not go deep among the masses, we will not know who the leftists are, and we will not know how to support the leftists. On August 18 last year, our most respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao received a million revolutionary youngsters. Chairman Mao believed in the masses so much, loved the masses so much, respected the masses' pioneering spirit so much, and was so close to the masses, setting us a great and brilliant example, deeply moving us and giving us a very profound education. Thus, we closely followed Chairman Mao, went deep among the masses, and decided to be a student of the masses. We had extensive contact with many revolutionary mass organizations and, with the revolutionary youngsters, analyzed the situation, discussed problems, studied together, and helped each other. The leading organs of the military district and some leading comrades' homes became propaganda stations for Mao Zedong Thought and reception stations for supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We were in contact with the revolutionary youngsters every day, learning from them, and receiving deep education. The revolutionary youngsters' love for Chairman Mao, love for Mao Zedong Thought, and their daring spirit of revolution constantly inspired us. We deeply felt that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great classroom for tempering and reforming ourselves, making us have a deeper understanding of the great and far-reaching significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, we could think what they thought, worry about what they worried about. We regarded their victories as our own victories, regarded their difficulties as our own difficulties, and regarded the shortcomings on them as the shortcomings on our class brothers. In the long-term side-by-side struggle, we gained the full trust of the revolutionary leftist masses. The revolutionary youngsters had no reservations in talking with us, enabling us to always be clear about the situation and to relatively correctly use the method of class analysis taught by Chairman Mao to recognize who our enemies are and who our friends are, making correct judgments in the great storms and waves, and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle.

In the process of going deep among the masses, we regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to the masses, organizing and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, as the primary task. When the revolutionary youngsters were fiercely suppressed by the handful of power-holders within the original Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road, and their revolutionary enthusiasm was dampened, we encouraged them to firmly believe in Chairman Mao, firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought, withstand the fierce winds and waves, and enhance their fighting spirit; when the class enemies organized some conservative groups and, using slander, defamation, and other vile means, incited some uninformed masses to attack the revolutionary factions, and the revolutionary factions were temporarily in the minority, we and the youngsters studied together Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to make sacrifices, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," encouraging them to withstand the test of class struggle, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance bravely; when the revolutionary youngsters broke through numerous obstacles and achieved great victories but showed some signs of neglecting the Party's policies and strategies, we told them some historical facts of revolutionary struggles, explaining the great significance of "policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party," and raising their level of policies and strategies. In short, we felt: the revolutionary masses have deep class feelings for the People's Liberation Army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao. They deeply trust the People's Liberation Army, regarding it as their strongest support and the mainstay of defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must not disappoint their expectations.

III

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Revolutionary leading cadres are the backbone forces for implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and carrying out the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. How to treat cadres is the key issue in the struggle to seize power. According to Chairman Mao's teachings of "uniting our true friends to attack our true enemies," being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to ourselves, we gave the most severe blows to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; to the leading cadres who firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we gave them full support.

The handful of power-holders within the original Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road tried to win over and subvert, form cliques, and collude with each other, engaging in activities to restore capitalism. When our great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the people of Heilongjiang Province began to rebel against them, they first tried to seize the army. They, in the name of the "Provincial Party Committee," asked us to consider the so-called "issue of safeguarding the security of the Provincial Party Committee." The Party Committee of our provincial military district saw through their plot, and in response, formulated five measures to firmly support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They then took advantage of the situation where the masses did not understand the content of the five measures, spreading rumors everywhere, saying that "the Provincial Military District issued five decisions, sending troops to suppress the revolutionary masses," attempting to incite some uninformed masses to direct their struggle against the Provincial Military District. At this time, we immediately retaliated, publicly disclosed the content of the five measures to the masses, and solemnly declared: We, the People's Liberation Army, are the strong backing of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, showing our firm stance of supporting the revolutionary masses. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were not reconciled to their failure. When the revolutionary masses surrounded them layer by layer and were on the verge of annihilation, they begged our provincial military district to be their air-raid shelter, attempting to sever our blood ties with the revolutionary masses and pull us over to their side. We sternly rejected them. It was very clear that they would not let us go. Under these circumstances, not intervening was impossible. The question was not whether to intervene or not, but on which side to stand, whether to support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat or to support the conservative or even rightist forces.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road stubbornly insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, trying in every way to shift the direction of the struggle. While deceiving the masses and inciting the masses to fight the masses, they directed the spearhead of the struggle against the revolutionary leading cadres who resolutely carried out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They thought that by doing so, they could knock down all the cadres, blur the class boundaries of the masses, confuse the boundaries between the proletarian power-holders and the power-holders taking the capitalist road, and confuse the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution, and in the chaos, preserve themselves, wait for an opportunity to rise again, and attempt to make the revolutionary masses lose their strong backbone and core, and weaken the fighting force of the leftist forces. More viciously, they attempted to fundamentally deny the basic fact that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been dominant for seventeen years and to deny the great achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past seventeen years. In a word, they wanted to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism. However, their beautiful dreams were shamefully shattered in the face of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In this regard, the most prominent manifestation was their attitude towards the original First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, Comrade Pan Fusheng. Comrade Pan Fusheng had not been in Heilongjiang Province for long and had always been excluded and attacked by the handful of power-holders within the Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road. In the early stage of the movement, although Comrade Pan Fusheng made some mistakes, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, he publicly made a profound self-criticism to the masses, stood up, and stood with the broad revolutionary masses, firmly supporting the revolutionary leftists. This aroused the hatred of the handful of power-holders within the original Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road, and they constantly used some conservative organizations to attack the organs of the Provincial Military District, directing the spearhead of the struggle against Comrade Pan Fusheng. Being opposed by the enemy proves that we are right. We were not afraid of being attacked, not afraid of being surrounded, not afraid of taking any risks, and more firmly supported Comrade Pan Fusheng and the revolutionary activities of the leftist masses. We actively provided him with various situations, ensured his working conditions, actively shared some of the work of the Provincial Party Committee; and introduced his situation to the revolutionary masses, exposed the enemy's plots, and eliminated the revolutionary masses' certain doubts and distrust of the revolutionary leading cadres. In this way, we created favorable conditions for Comrade Pan Fusheng to often help the Red Guards analyze the revolutionary situation, study combat strategies, grasp the direction of the movement, and achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    永远和无产阶级革命派站在一起
    黑龙江省军区司令员　汪家道
    毛主席亲自缔造和领导的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的柱石。在当前这场激烈的阶级斗争中，最勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，最热情地支持革命左派群众，狠狠地打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是我们人民军队的光荣的历史使命。
    我们黑龙江省军区全体指战员始终坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，满腔热情、全心全意地支持了无产阶级革命派，分化和瓦解了保守派，坚决地镇压了反革命组织的反扑，在无产阶级革命派实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的斗争中，积极地执行了自己的战斗任务。
    一
    毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们在支持无产阶级革命派的过程当中，省军区党委首先加强了自己的思想革命化，使党委领导形成了一个团结战斗的核心，思想统一，行动一致，带领部队广大指战员沿着毛主席所指引的方向不断前进。
    在斗争的实践中，我们深深体会到：紧跟毛主席，紧跟党中央，紧跟中央军委，紧跟中央文革小组，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，正确地对待自己，是军队支持无产阶级革命派最根本的保证。每当出现一个新事物，遇到一个新问题，我们大家就坐在一起，敞开思想，谈认识，摆观点，提问题，进行充分的讨论，然后作出一致的决定。运动初期，群众开始发动起来的时候，我们对介入不介入的问题进行了充分的讨论。毛主席说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”我们根据毛主席的教导，深刻地认识到，在这样一场严峻的阶级斗争中，不管不问，袖手旁观是错误的，必须积极主动地担负起保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战斗任务。于是我们通过武装部、民兵、警卫部队等各条渠道调查无产阶级文化大革命的情况，随时掌握各派政治势力动向；派出大批人员，深入群众，广泛接触社会，进行调查研究，分清敌我友，保持高度警惕；当运动进一步深入以后，两条路线、两条道路的斗争界线开始分明的时候，我们用毛主席的阶级分析的方法，对影响较大的群众组织的政治态度，又做了专门的讨论。使我们明确了必须坚定地站在左派群众一边，站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，给左派群众以力所能及的帮助。对于保守派的组织，则按照毛主席的教导，本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的原则，进行批评和帮助。当无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们伟大的统帅毛主席向全军发出了人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的战斗号召，我们立即挺身而出，和无产阶级革命派实行“三结合”，一举从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺回了一切大权，尽了自己应尽的责任。
    二
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”我们在实践中深深体会到：深入到群众里面去，和群众在一起，是支持无产阶级革命派的前提；不深入到群众里面去，就不知道谁是左派，就不懂得怎样支持左派。去年八月十八日，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席接见了百万革命小将，毛主席是那样地相信群众，是那样地爱护群众，是那样地尊重群众的首创精神，是那样地和群众心连心，为我们树立了极其伟大而光辉的榜样，使我们深受感动，受到了非常深刻的教育。于是我们紧跟毛主席，深入到群众中去，决心甘当一名群众的小学生。我们和许多革命群众组织广泛接触，和革命小将们在一起分析形势，讨论问题，共同学习，互相帮助。军区领导机关和有的领导同志的家里，成了毛泽东思想的宣传站和支持无产阶级革命派的接待站。我们和革命小将天天接触，耳濡目染，受到了很深的教益。革命小将们热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，以及他们敢于革命的精神，时时在感染着我们。使我们深深感到无产阶级文化大革命运动，是一个锻炼自己，改造自己的大课堂，使我们对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大的深远的意义，有了更加深刻的理解。因此，我们才能够想他们所想，急他们所急。把他们的胜利看做是自己的胜利，把他们的困难当成自己的困难，把他们身上的缺点，看做是自己阶级兄弟身上的缺点。在长期的并肩战斗的过程中，我们取得了革命左派群众的充分信任。革命小将们和我们无所不谈，使我们能够时时做到情况明，能够比较正确地运用毛主席教导我们的阶级分析方法，认清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，在大风大浪里，做出正确的判断，紧紧地把握住斗争的大方向。
    在深入群众的过程中，我们把向群众宣传毛泽东思想和党的政策，用毛泽东思想组织群众，武装群众，当成首要的任务。在革命小将们受到原黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的疯狂镇压，革命情绪受到挫伤的时候，我们就鼓励他们坚信毛主席，坚信毛泽东思想，顶住狂风逆浪，增强战斗勇气；在阶级敌人组织了一些保守团体，利用造谣、诬蔑等各种卑劣手段，挑动一些不明真相的群众，围攻革命派，革命派暂时处于少数的时候，我们就和小将们在一起学习毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，鼓励他们经受住阶级斗争的考验，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋勇前进；在革命小将冲破重重的阻力取得巨大的胜利而出现某些忽视党的政策和策略的苗头的时候，我们就讲述一些革命斗争史实，说明“政策和策略是党的生命”的重大意义，提高他们的政策和策略水平。总之，我们体会到：革命群众对毛主席所亲自缔造和领导的人民解放军有着深厚的阶级感情，他们无限信赖中国人民解放军，把人民解放军看作是自己最坚强的后盾，看做是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱，我们绝不应该辜负他们的期望。
    三
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”革命领导干部是实行革命“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展夺权斗争的骨干力量。怎样对待干部，是夺权斗争的关键问题。我们按照毛主席“团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人”，对敌狠，对己和的教导，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，给以最严厉的打击；对坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边的领导干部，则竭尽全力给以支持。
    原黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，招降纳叛，结党营私，串通一气，大搞资本主义复辟的活动。当我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，黑龙江省人民起来开始造他们的反的时候，他们首先就是企图抓军队。他们以“省委”的名义，要我们考虑所谓“保卫省委的安全”问题。我们省军区党委识破了他们的阴谋，针锋相对，制定了坚决支持无产阶级革命派的五条措施。他们又利用群众不了解五条措施内容的情况，到处刮阴风，造谣言，胡说什么“省军区做出五条决定，派兵镇压革命群众”，妄图煽动一些不明真相的群众把斗争矛头指向省军区。这时，我们毫不迟疑地予以还击，向群众公开了五条措施的内容，并且郑重宣告：我们人民解放军是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，表明了我们支持革命群众的坚定立场。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心于自己的失败，他们在革命群众层层包围、陷入灭顶之灾的时候，乞求我们省军区做他们的防空洞，借以割断我们和革命群众的血肉联系，把我们拉过去。我们义正词严地把他们顶了回去。很清楚，他们是不会放过我们的。在这种情况下，不介入是不可能的，问题不是介入不介入的问题，而是站在那一边的问题，是支持无产阶级革命派，还是支持保守派甚至右派的问题。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，千方百计地转移斗争的大方向。他们在蒙骗群众、挑动群众斗群众的同时，极力把斗争的矛头对准坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的革命领导干部。他们以为这样做，就可以把所有的干部统统打倒，可以模糊群众的阶级界限，混淆无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的界限，混淆革命和反革命的界限，在混战中使他们自己保存下来，伺机再起，妄想使革命群众失去坚强的骨干和核心，削弱左派队伍的战斗力。更恶毒的是，他们妄图从根本上否定十七年来以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线占统治地位的基本事实，否定十七年来我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。一句话，就是要达到他们资本主义复辟的目的。但是，他们的如意美梦，在毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，可耻地破产了。在这方面，突出的表现在对原黑龙江省委第一书记潘复生同志的态度上。潘复生同志来黑龙江省工作时间不长，一直受省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的排斥和打击。在运动初期，潘复生同志虽然一度犯过错误，但在党的八届十一中全会后，公开向群众做了深刻的检查，挺身而出，和广大革命群众站在一起，坚决支持革命左派。这就引起了原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的仇恨，他们不断利用一些保守派的组织，冲击省军区机关，把斗争矛头指向潘复生同志。被敌人反对，证明我们做对了。我们不怕被冲击，不怕被包围，不怕担任何风险，更加坚决地支持潘复生同志，支持左派群众的革命活动。我们主动为他提供各方面的情况，保证他的工作条件，主动地分担省委的一些工作；并向革命群众介绍他的情况，揭露敌人的阴谋，消除革命群众对革命领导干部的某些怀疑和不信任的情绪。这样，就为潘复生同志在无产阶级文化大革命运动中经常帮助红色造反者分析革命形势，研究斗争策略，掌握运动大方向，实现革命的“三结合”创造了有利的条件。
