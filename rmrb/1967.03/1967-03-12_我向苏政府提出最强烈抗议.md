The Soviet revisionists forcibly detained Chairman Mao's works on a Chinese international train and brutally assaulted our crew members. We strongly protest to the Soviet government.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the chargé d'affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, Razdukhov, on March 11, and handed him a note expressing strong protest against the Soviet authorities' detention of Chairman Mao's works on display on a Chinese international train at the Nauushki station in the Soviet Union on March 6, and the brutal assault on Chinese international train crew members, creating a new anti-China provocation. The note stated that the Chinese government is extremely indignant about this and strongly protests to the Soviet government.

The note pointed out that the Soviet authorities' creation of this new anti-China provocation is a serious step in the Soviet government's deliberate sabotage of Sino-Soviet relations, following two previous fascist acts of Soviet military police thugs beating Chinese students in Europe and Chinese diplomatic personnel. The Soviet government must bear full responsibility for this.

The note said that on February 25, when the Chinese international train was en route to Moscow and passing through the Nauushki station, the Soviet border authorities, under the pretext of illegality, attempted to detain Chairman Mao's works, the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, on display on the Chinese train for international passengers to read. When the Chinese train conductor, Yan Fang and Wang Delong, reasoned with them and pointed out that the Soviet side had no right to detain the works, a Soviet border military colonel bluntly stated that this was "in accordance with the regulations of the Soviet government," and "it is pointless to argue," and ordered soldiers to forcibly seize 222 copies of Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The Chinese train conductor immediately lodged a strong protest against this arrogant and unreasonable behavior. The Soviet side, finding themselves in the wrong, had no choice but to agree to return the works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" when the train returned.

However, the Soviet side broke its own promise. On March 6, when the Chinese international train returned to the Nauushki station from Moscow, the Soviet border authorities refused to return the works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that they had forcibly detained. When the Chinese train conductor raised the issue, the Soviet border personnel were unreasonable. A Soviet border military captain, together with the station master, customs director, and over thirty soldiers under their command, surrounded and assaulted the Chinese train crew members, and dragged the Chinese train conductor, Yan Fang, out of the carriage, punching him in the head, causing him to be injured and bleed. Another train conductor, Wang Delong, and six crew members were also beaten. Crew member Ren Xiuzhi's ribs and Zhang Ronggui's chest were injured. It is clear that the anti-China farce at the Nauushki station is another specific manifestation of the Soviet government's anti-China policy.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note said that it is entirely legitimate and beyond reproach for the Chinese side to display Chairman Mao's works on its international trains for passengers to read. Displaying propaganda materials is a normal practice on all international trains. Your trains heading to China also display your propaganda materials, and the Chinese authorities have never interfered. We display Chairman Mao's works, and you interfere without reason, detaining them unlawfully. This not only disregards the strong desire of passengers to read Chairman Mao's works but also once again exposes how much you fear the truth, how much you fear Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

The note said that it must be pointed out that the Chinese international train travels between Beijing and Moscow according to the relevant countries' railway transit agreements, and the Soviet side has the obligation to ensure the normal operation of the Chinese train and the personal safety of Chinese crew members. Now you have dispatched border troops to brutally assault unarmed Chinese train crew members. We ask, where do you place the railway transit agreement? Does the Soviet government still intend to fulfill its international obligations?

The note said that the Chinese government solemnly demands that the Soviet government must apologize to the Chinese side, severely punish the perpetrators, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

On March 11, the Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China sent a protest telegram to the Soviet Ministry of Transport, pointing out that the anti-China farce at the Nauushki station in the Soviet Union is a provocative act by the Soviet authorities to deliberately sabotage international railway cooperation and is another serious step in further deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations. The Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China expressed great indignation and strongly protested to the Soviet Ministry of Transport, demanding that the Soviet Ministry of Transport must apologize to the Chinese side, severely punish the perpetrators, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

The new anti-China provocation created by the Soviet authorities has aroused great anger among our people. When the Chinese international train crew members, who were brutally assaulted by the Soviet border troops, returned to Beijing on March 8, hundreds of revolutionary masses from the capital gathered at the Beijing Railway Station to strongly protest the savage acts of the Soviet authorities in assaulting our train crew members.

The Chinese international train crew members were warmly welcomed by representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital at the Beijing Railway Station. At the welcoming ceremony, people held the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly chanted: "Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist authorities in brutally assaulting our crew members!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!"

After the welcoming ceremony began, the train crew members and the participants chanted Chairman Mao's teachings: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various oppressions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote more extensive and more violent revolutions."

Train conductor Wang Delong spoke at the welcoming ceremony. He, on behalf of all the crew members, angrily denounced the fascist atrocities of the Soviet border troops and strongly protested to the Soviet revisionist authorities. He said with great emotion:

"Thank you, great leader Chairman Mao, for your meticulous care for us, and thank you, the people of our motherland, for your firm support. We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.'"

A responsible person from the Ministry of Railways, representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital, representatives of the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, and representatives of Chinese students who recently returned from the Soviet Union also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously praised the revolutionary fighting spirit of all the honorably returned train crew members and expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, and fight to the end with Soviet modern revisionism.

When our train crew members returned to Erlian, they were warmly welcomed and kindly comforted by the revolutionary workers of Erlian Station.

    苏修强行扣留中国国际列车上的毛主席著作并野蛮殴打我乘务人员
    我向苏政府提出最强烈抗议
    我外交部照会指出，苏联当局制造这一新的反华挑衅事件，是蓄意破坏中苏两国关系的又一严重步骤，苏联政府必须对此承担全部责任
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部苏联东欧司负责人，三月十一日召见苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫，交给他一份照会，强烈抗议苏联当局于一九六七年三月六日在苏联纳乌什基车站强行扣留陈列在中国国际列车上的毛主席著作，野蛮殴打中国国际列车乘务人员，制造新的反华挑衅事件。照会说，中国政府对此表示极大的愤慨，并向苏联政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，苏联当局制造这一新的反华挑衅事件，是继苏联军警暴徒殴打中国留欧学生和中国外交人员两次法西斯暴行之后，苏联政府蓄意破坏中苏两国关系的又一严重步骤，苏联政府必须对此承担全部责任。
    照会说，二月二十五日，中国国际列车在开往莫斯科途经纳乌什基车站时，苏联边防部门以所谓不合法为借口，企图扣留中国列车上陈列的供国际旅客阅读的当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的著作。当中国列车长阎芳和王德龙据理进行交涉、指出苏方无权扣留时，苏联边防军一中校直言不讳地说这是“奉苏联政府的规定”，“讲道理是多余的”，并命令士兵强行抢走了毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》共二百二十二本。中国列车长对此蛮横无理的行为当即提出了强烈抗议。苏联方面理亏词穷，被迫答应在列车返回时如数归还毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》。
    可是苏联方面违背了自己的诺言。三月六日，当中国国际列车由莫斯科返抵纳乌什基车站时，苏联边防部门拒不如数归还被他们强行扣留的毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》。在我列车长提出交涉时，苏联边防人员蛮不讲理。苏联边防军一少校竟伙同车站站长、海关关长，和在他们指挥下的三十多名士兵包围和殴打中国列车乘务人员，并将中国列车长阎芳拉出车厢，用拳猛击他的头部，致使受伤出血。另一列车长王德龙和六名乘务员也都遭到了殴打。乘务员任修志的肋骨和张荣贵的胸部均被打伤。事实很清楚，纳乌什基车站上的这一场反华丑剧，是苏联政府反华政策的又一个新的具体表现。
    我外交部的照会说，中国方面在自己的国际列车上陈列供旅客阅读的毛主席著作是正当的，无可非议的。陈放宣传品，是所有国际列车的正常做法。你们开往中国的列车上也陈放你们的宣传品，中国当局从来没有干涉。我们陈列毛主席著作，你们竟然横加干涉，无理扣留，这不仅是无视旅客阅读毛主席著作的强烈愿望，而且再一次暴露了你们是多么害怕真理，害怕马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    照会说，必须指出，中国国际列车是根据有关国家铁路联运协议往返于北京和莫斯科之间的，苏联方面有义务切实保障中国列车的正常运行和中国乘务人员的人身安全。现在你们竟然出动边防军野蛮殴打手无寸铁的中国列车乘务人员，我们要问，你们把铁路联运协议置于何地？苏联政府还打算不打算履行自己所承担的国际义务？
    照会说，中国政府严正要求苏联政府必须向中国方面赔礼道歉，严惩肇事凶手，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    三月十一日，中华人民共和国铁道部向苏联交通部发了抗议电，指出在苏联纳乌什基车站上演出的反华丑剧，是苏联当局蓄意破坏国际铁路合作的挑衅事件，也是进一步恶化中苏两国关系的又一严重步骤。对此，中华人民共和国铁道部向苏联交通部表示极大的愤慨，提出最强烈的抗议，并严正要求，苏联交通部必须向中国方面赔礼道歉，严惩肇事凶手，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    苏联当局制造的这一新的反华挑衅事件，激起了我国人民的极大愤怒。被苏联边防军野蛮殴打的中国国际列车乘务员于八日回到北京时，首都无产阶级革命派数百人在北京车站集会，强烈抗议苏联当局殴打我国列车乘务人员的野蛮暴行。
    中国国际列车乘务员在北京车站受到首都无产阶级革命派代表的热烈欢迎。在欢迎会上，人们高举红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“全世界无产者联合起来！”“强烈抗议苏修当局野蛮殴打我国乘务人员的法西斯暴行！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”
    欢迎会开始后，我列车乘务员和参加欢迎会的人们齐声朗诵毛主席的教导：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    列车长王德龙在欢迎会上讲话。他代表全体乘务人员愤怒控诉苏联边防军的法西斯暴行，向苏修当局提出最强烈的抗议。他以无比激动的心情说：
  “感谢伟大领袖毛主席对我们无微不至的关怀，感谢祖国人民对我们的坚决支持，我们一定牢记毛主席的教导：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”
    铁道部负责人、首都无产阶级革命派代表、首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会代表和不久前经苏联回国的我国留学生代表，也在大会上讲了话。他们一致赞扬了全体光荣归来的列车乘务员的革命斗争精神，表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，运用毛泽东思想这个锐利武器，同苏联现代修正主义斗争到底。
    我国列车乘务员回到二连时，受到二连站革命职工的热烈欢迎和亲切的慰问。
