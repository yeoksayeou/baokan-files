The Qingdao Municipal Three-Level Cadres Conference issues a call to all revolutionary masses in the city to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The conference determined the current battle tasks: to further carry out the rectification movement, to fully achieve great unity by unit and by department, to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. To further implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," immediately launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Jinan on March 21st stated that the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao recently jointly held the first large-scale three-level cadres conference since the seizure of power in Qingdao.

This conference analyzed the excellent situation in Qingdao after the seizure of power and studied and determined the current battle tasks. The conference decided that the current central task for the proletarian revolutionary masses in Qingdao is to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further carry out the rectification movement, to fully achieve great unity by unit and by department, to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. To further implement the great policy proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao of "grasp revolution, promote production," immediately launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production throughout the city, and achieve double victories in revolution and production. The conference called on all proletarian revolutionary masses in the city to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry the revolution through to the end," to continue to advance victoriously, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to complete victory!

More than 2,000 people attended this conference, including leaders of the newly established revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs in municipal, district (county) organs, factories, enterprises, and public institutions, leaders at various levels of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao and the Qingdao Military District, as well as representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary leading cadres. They discussed the situation and tasks in Qingdao after the seizure of power with the attitude of masters and full of revolutionary enthusiasm.

The conference believed that after seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the proletarian revolutionary masses in Qingdao, under the guidance of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved one great victory after another in revolution and production. At present, in all units that need to seize power throughout the city, the proletarian revolutionary masses have seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Many units, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, have united with revolutionary leading cadres to establish revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, firmly grasping all powers in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Based on carrying out the rectification movement, the proletarian revolutionary masses are achieving great unity by unit and by department. They are closely united around the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee, forming a vast, organized, and disciplined cultural revolution army, pushing the revolution and production to develop in depth. Because the proletarian revolutionary masses have resolutely implemented the great policy proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao of "grasp revolution, promote production," industrial and agricultural production is also very lively. The city's total industrial output has increased significantly, product quality is stable, and varieties have increased. These situations show that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao is very good and getting better and better!

The conference pointed out that the victory of the seizure of power is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li, and there are still a series of heavy and complex tasks such as how to hold power well and use power well in front of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Qingdao. The conference conducted specific studies and deployments on the main tasks at present.

The conference believed that further implementing the resolution of the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee and quickly achieving great unity by unit and by department among the proletarian revolutionary masses is a key to promoting the continuous development of various work. Due to the development of the revolutionary situation, the previous cross-industry and cross-department great unity has exposed many serious shortcomings. It has affected the unity among the proletarian revolutionary masses, making it impossible for the proletarian revolutionary masses within a unit to concentrate their efforts to carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation, to unite as one to do a good job in production, and it is not conducive to the thought revolutionization and organizational revolutionization of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Therefore, achieving great unity by unit and by department is the need of the development of the revolutionary situation and the urgent demand of the broad masses. Chairman Mao said: "Everything for the victory of the front line, the organizational task must be subordinate to the political task." In the current situation, whether or not to achieve great unity by unit and by department is a touchstone to test whether an organization is truly a revolutionary organization and whether it is high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The conference pointed out that since the Municipal Revolutionary Committee issued the decision on achieving great unity by unit and by department, many revolutionary worker organizations in Qingdao have, with the greatness of the working class, timely issued decisions and initiatives to dissolve the headquarters, branches, and liaison stations, and called on the affiliated organizations to withdraw their full-time personnel to return to their original units and resolutely achieve great unity by unit and by department. This fully reflects that the working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, has the greatest organizational spirit and discipline, and is the most considerate of the overall situation. They are indeed the main force of the Cultural Revolution and have set an example for all proletarian revolutionary masses in the city. However, there are still some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who, from the perspective of personal or small group interests, put forward various "reasons" and are unwilling to achieve great unity by unit and by department. In essence, it is the "self" in their minds that is at work. The conference requires all revolutionary comrades to, through rectification, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly eliminate mountainism, sectarianism, small-groupism, and anarchism and other non-proletarian thoughts, to proceed from the revolutionary overall situation, to quickly and fully achieve great unity by unit and by department, and to strive for the completion of new historical tasks.

Regarding the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the conference proposed that to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must first correctly handle the revolutionary masses' representative figures participating in the "three-in-one combination." They are the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have made immortal contributions in the struggle for seizing power. After seizing power, we must attach importance to their role and cannot treat them as mere decorations. It should be seen that these revolutionary masses' representative figures are full of revolutionary vigor, have clear standpoints, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and are extremely responsible to the Party and the people. They dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and are rich in revolutionary creative spirit. They maintain close contact with the masses and represent and reflect the demands and wishes of the revolutionary masses. Therefore, in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, we must fully attach importance to and give play to their role.

In the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must correctly handle cadres. We must overcome the wrong tendency of not distinguishing between right and wrong, generally rejecting and generally overthrowing cadres; we must also prevent the wrong tendency of not making class analysis of cadres and generally pulling out cadres to combine. At present, both tendencies exist in Qingdao and need to be overcome. The correct attitude is to welcome revolutionary cadres to come out and oppose pulling out non-revolutionary cadres, and to firmly prevent the power-holders taking the capitalist road from squeezing in.

To implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must also attach importance to the role of the People's Liberation Army. In Qingdao, not only does the Municipal Revolutionary Committee have representatives of the People's Liberation Army participating, but also in various districts and large enterprises and public institutions, there are representatives of the People's Liberation Army participating. Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The People's Liberation Army participating in the temporary power organs has strengthened the forces of the revolutionary masses, strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have also brought the fine traditions of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, highlighting politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement to the temporary power organs, which will play a great role in promoting the thought revolutionization of leading cadres at all levels and the broad masses. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army is the learning example of the proletarian revolutionary masses and all the people. Whoever dares to sow discord between the revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army and directs the spearhead at the People's Liberation Army must be firmly struck down.

The conference pointed out that this year is the second year of the third five-year plan and will also be a year in which the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieves decisive victory. The proletarian revolutionary masses must, after the victory of seizing power, timely guide the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to production. We must further implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the strategic policy of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," and quickly launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production. In industrial production, we must strive to increase production, practice economy, improve quality, expand varieties, reduce costs, improve labor productivity, and strive to overfulfill the production tasks of the first quarter and the first half of the year, so that the industrial production this year will have an overall and significant increase. In agricultural production, we must immediately take effective measures, seize the time, act swiftly, and immediately launch a new high tide of spring plowing production to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

The conference emphasized that in developing industrial and agricultural production, we must follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the people have limitless creative power," mobilize the masses extensively, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, break all rules and regulations that bind productive forces, combine with the actual situation, gradually establish and improve new rules and regulations that adapt to the socialist economic base, establish a new revolutionary order, and promote the rapid development of productive forces. The conference also requires that whether it is an industrial or agricultural production unit, we must popularize the experience of Huairou County, Beijing, and quickly establish a command headquarters for grasping revolution and promoting production on the front line to strengthen the leadership of industrial and agricultural production, so that the industrial and agricultural production of the whole city will quickly present a new situation of all-around leap.

    青岛市三级干部会议向全市无产阶级革命派发出号召
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗把文化大革命进行到底
    会议确定当前战斗任务：进一步开展整风运动，全面实现按单位、按部门大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，加强无产阶级专政。进一步贯彻“抓革命，促生产”方针，立即掀起工农业生产新高潮，夺取革命和生产双胜利。
    新华社济南二十一日电　青岛市革命委员会和中国人民解放军驻青岛部队，最近联合召开了青岛市夺权胜利后的第一次规模盛大的三级干部会。
    这次大会，分析了青岛市夺权胜利后的大好形势，研究并确定了当前的战斗任务。会议确定，青岛市无产阶级革命派当前的中心任务是：更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步开展整风运动，全面实现按单位、按部门的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，加强无产阶级专政，巩固无产阶级政权。进一步贯彻伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，立即在全市掀起一个工农业生产的新高潮，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。会议号召全市无产阶级革命派坚决按照毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导，继续乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命胜利地进行到底！
    参加这次大会的，有市、区（县）级机关和工厂企业、事业单位新建立的革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的负责人，中国人民解放军驻青岛部队和青岛市武装部门各级负责人，以及无产阶级革命派代表和革命的领导干部等共二千多人。他们以主人翁的姿态，满怀革命的豪情，共同讨论了青岛市夺权胜利后的形势和任务。
    会议认为，青岛市无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权以后，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，革命和生产取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。目前在全市范围内，在一切需要夺权的单位，无产阶级革命派都已从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里，把党政财文大权夺了过来。不少单位在人民解放军的支持下，团结革命的领导干部，建立了革命“三结合”的临时权力机构，把一切大权紧紧掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。在开展整风运动的基础上，无产阶级革命派正在按单位、按部门进行大联合，他们紧密团结在青岛市革命委员会周围，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的有组织、有纪律的文化革命大军，推动革命和生产向纵深发展。由于无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻了伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，工农业生产也是一片热气腾腾。全市工业总产值大幅度增加，产品质量稳定，品种有所增加。这些情况说明，青岛市无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很，而且越来越好！
    会议指出，夺权斗争的胜利仅仅是万里长征走完了第一步，夺权以后还有如何掌好权、用好权等一系列繁重、复杂的任务摆在青岛市无产阶级革命派的面前，会议对当前的各项主要任务都作了具体的研究和部署。
    会议认为，进一步贯彻青岛市革命委员会的决议，尽快地实现无产阶级革命派按单位、按部门大联合，是当前推动各项工作继续向前发展的一个重要关键。由于革命形势的发展，原来那种跨行业、跨部门的大联合，已经暴露出许多严重的缺点，它影响了无产阶级革命派之间的团结，使一个单位内的无产阶级革命派不能集中力量进行斗批改，不能团结一致搞好生产，也不利于无产阶级革命派的思想革命化和组织革命化。因此，按单位、按部门进行大联合是革命形势发展的需要，也是广大群众的迫切要求。毛主席说：“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务。”在目前的形势下，能不能按单位、按部门实行大联合，是检验一个组织是不是真正的革命组织，是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的一个试金石。会议指出，自从市革命委员会发布按单位、按部门大联合的决定后，青岛市许多革命工人组织，都以工人阶级的豪迈气魄，及时发出了撤销总部、分部、联络站的决定和倡议，并且号召所属组织的脱产人员回到原单位坚决按单位、按部门进行大联合，这充分体现了工人阶级最有远见，最大公无私，最有组织性、纪律性，最顾全大局，他们不愧是文化大革命的主力军，为全市无产阶级革命派作出了榜样。但是，现在还有一些革命群众组织的负责人，从自己个人或小团体的利益出发，提出种种“理由”，不愿实现按单位、按部门的大联合，实质上是脑子里的“私”字在作怪。会议要求一切革命派同志通过整风，活学活用毛主席著作，大破私字，大立公字，彻底扫除山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等非无产阶级思想，从革命的大局出发，迅速地、全面地按单位、按部门联合起来，为完成新的历史任务而奋斗。
    关于革命的“三结合”，会议提出，要实现革命的“三结合”，首先必须正确对待参加“三结合”的革命群众的代表人物。他们是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将，在夺权斗争中立下了不朽的功勋。在夺权以后，必须重视他们的作用，决不能把他们当作陪衬。应该看到，这些革命群众的代表人物，充满革命朝气，立场鲜明，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，对党和人民极端负责。他们敢想、敢说、敢干，富于革命的创造精神。他们与广大群众保持密切联系，代表和反映着革命群众的要求和愿望。因此在“三结合”的临时权力机构中，必须充分重视和发挥他们的作用。
    在革命的“三结合”中必须正确对待干部。既要克服对干部不分青红皂白，一概排斥、一概打倒的错误倾向；又要防止对干部不作阶级分析，不论什么干部都拉出来结合的错误倾向。目前青岛市这两种倾向同时存在，都需要注意克服。正确的态度是欢迎革命的干部站出来，反对把不革命的干部拉出来，严防走资本主义道路的当权派削尖了脑袋钻进来。
    实行革命的“三结合”，还必须重视人民解放军的作用。青岛市不但市革命委员会有人民解放军代表参加，各区和大型的企业、事业单位都有人民解放军代表参加。毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民解放军参加临时权力机构，壮大了革命派的力量，加强了无产阶级专政。他们还把活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风等优良传统带到临时权力机构中来，这对于促进各级领导干部和广大群众的思想革命化都将起很大的作用。因此，人民解放军是无产阶级革命派和全体人民的学习榜样，谁敢挑拨革命群众和人民解放军的关系，把矛头指向人民解放军，必须坚决加以打击。
    会议指出，今年是第三个五年计划的第二年，又将是无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一年。无产阶级革命派在夺权胜利后必须把广大群众在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命积极性，及时引导到生产上去。必须进一步贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示和“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针，迅速掀起一个工农业生产新高潮。在工业生产上，要努力增加生产，厉行节约，提高质量，扩大品种，降低成本，提高劳动生产率，力争全面超额完成第一季度和上半年的生产任务，使今年的工业生产有个全面的、较大幅度的增长。农业生产方面，当前要立即采取有力措施，争分夺秒，雷厉风行，立即掀起一个春耕生产新高潮，为全年农业丰收打下坚实的基础。
    会议强调指出，在发展工农业生产中，都要遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民群众有无限的创造力”的教导，放手发动群众，发挥广大群众的积极性、创造性，打破一切束缚生产力的规章制度，结合实际，逐步建立和健全适应社会主义经济基础的新的规章制度，建立革命的新秩序，促进生产力的迅速发展。会议还要求，无论工业或农业生产单位都要推广北京市怀柔县的经验，迅速建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，以加强工农业生产的领导，使全市的工农业生产迅速出现全面跃进的新局面。
