    The Rising Sun
    Youth of East Africa

    Many people in the past always thought that once the people seize state power, everything will be fine, and they can sleep soundly. The revolutionary experiences of many countries have already and are continuing to prove, and will continue to prove, that this is completely wrong.

    Under the leadership of the great genius Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have already recognized the extremely important significance of fighting against this fallacy. For this reason, the Chinese people have launched an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    No matter what, we must strive to be good students of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's profound revolutionary theories are not only applicable to China but also to the peoples of the rest of the world. I say this based on my personal experience. Whoever can study well and consciously apply the teachings of the contemporary Lenin-Mao will be a revolutionary who remains forever young.

    The Red Guards are the hope and the rising sun of China. The enemies' abuse of you clearly shows that you have achieved great victories.

    The hearts of all the laboring people and oppressed peoples of Africa and the world are with you.

    初升的太阳
    东非青年
    许多人过去总以为，人民一旦掌握了国家权力，就万事大吉了，他们就可以安然地睡大觉了。许多国家的革命经验已经并正在证明，将来也将继续证明，这是大错特错的。
    中国人民在伟大的天才毛泽东同志的领导下，已经认识到同这种谬论作斗争的极端重要的意义。为此，中国人民掀起了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。
    无论如何要努力做毛主席的好学生，毛主席深刻的革命学说不仅适用于中国，而且也适用于世界上其他一切人民。我是根据自己的切身经验讲这句话的。谁能学好并自觉地运用当代的列宁——毛主席的教导，谁就是一个永葆青春的革命者。
    红卫兵是中国的希望和初升的太阳。敌人对你们的谩骂清楚地表明，你们取得了很大的胜利。
    非洲和世界一切劳动人民和被压迫人民的心，是同你们在一起的。
