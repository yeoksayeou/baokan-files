The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Zao Yuan Brigade, where our great leader Chairman Mao once lived, in Zao Yuan Commune, Yan'an, have responded enthusiastically to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They are carrying forward glorious traditions, grasping the revolution, vigorously promoting production, and have launched a spring ploughing production campaign.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Zao Yuan Brigade used the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big struggles, and big criticisms to expose and criticize the problems existing in the leadership of the commune and production brigade. They fought against a handful of ghosts and snakes attempting to sabotage the revolution and production. In the struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, further raising their class consciousness. Their revolutionary enthusiasm is high, and production is booming.

After receiving the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country, the poor and lower-middle peasants immediately studied and discussed it. They excitedly said: We people of Zao Yuan have the deepest understanding of the great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao. When Chairman Mao lived in Zao Yuan, to overcome the severe economic difficulties caused by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to win the revolutionary war, he led the revolutionary war on one hand and called on the liberated area's military and civilians to launch a mass production movement on the other. At that time, Chairman Mao paid great attention to the production of the Zao Yuan people, sending cadres to help us make production plans; organizing the staff of the Central Committee to help us build the "Happiness Canal." Under his personal leadership, the military and civilians of the liberated area achieved great victories in both production development and anti-enemy struggles. Now, Chairman Mao has issued the great call of "grasp the revolution, promote production" again. We, the people of Zao Yuan, will definitely respond resolutely, carry forward the revolutionary tradition, strive for greater glory, grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zao Yuan Brigade correctly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, conducted a specific analysis of the situation of the cadres in the brigade, and paid attention to educating and uniting those cadres who made general mistakes but were willing to correct them. The vast majority of cadres seriously examined their shortcomings and mistakes, put down their burdens, and took up the leadership of spring ploughing production. On this basis, Zao Yuan Brigade established a "three-in-one" leadership team for production, composed of representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, militia representatives, and brigade cadres. This leadership team, in leading production, emphasized politics and studied Chairman Mao's works together with the community members. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, with the revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Cultural Revolution, threw themselves into spring ploughing production. They went to work early and returned late, actively accumulated fertilizer for the collective, built water conservancy projects, repaired spring ploughing tools, and strove for a bumper harvest this year.

The militia company of the brigade is not only a vanguard and pioneer of the cultural revolution but also a backbone and shock troop of spring ploughing production. To make the "Happiness Canal" play a greater role, they took the initiative to undertake the task of repairing the canal with stones. Since the brigade had few means of transportation, they carried the stones one by one to the construction site. Some old Red Guards and old guerrillas also actively participated in spring ploughing production, determined to achieve new victories in agricultural production this year.

Now, the preparatory work for spring ploughing in Zao Yuan Brigade is almost completed. According to the plan, the entire brigade needs 3.9 million pounds of fertilizer for the whole year. So far, nearly 3 million pounds of fertilizer have been prepared for top-dressing the spring fields and wheat fields. The work of transporting fertilizer, preparing plows, and preparing harrows is being carried out in an intense manner, and agricultural water conservancy projects are also being repaired urgently.

    枣园大队贫下中农和干部响应毛主席的号召
    情绪高昂搞革命　热气腾腾闹春耕
    新华社西安二十三日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席住过的延安枣园公社枣园大队，广大贫下中农和队干部响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，发扬光荣传统，狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，枣园大队的贫下中农运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，揭发批判了公社、生产大队领导上存在的问题，斗争了一小撮妄图破坏革命、破坏生产的牛鬼蛇神。贫下中农在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，革命情绪高昂，生产搞得热气腾腾。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》传来后，贫下中农立即进行了学习和讨论。他们激动地说：咱们枣园人，对伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针体会最深。当年毛主席在咱枣园住的时候，为了克服日本侵略者和蒋介石反动派给我们造成的严重经济困难，夺取革命战争的胜利，就一面领导革命战争，一面号召解放区军民开展大生产运动。那时，毛主席非常关心枣园人民的生产，派干部帮我们订生产计划；组织中央机关的工作人员帮咱们修“幸福渠”。在他老人家的亲自领导下，解放区军民在发展生产和对敌斗争两个战场上都取得了伟大胜利。现在，毛主席又向我们发出“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，我们枣园人民坚决响应，一定要发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    枣园大队的贫下中农正确执行毛主席的干部政策，对本大队的干部情况作了具体分析，注意教育和团结那些犯有一般错误而又愿意改正的干部。绝大多数干部认真检查了自己的缺点和错误，放下包袱，挑起了领导春耕生产的担子。在这个基础上，枣园大队成立了由贫下中农代表、民兵代表和大队干部组成的“三结合”领导生产的班子。这个领导班子在领导生产中突出政治，和社员一起活学活用毛主席著作。广大贫下中农带着在文化大革命中焕发起来的革命干劲，投入了春耕生产。他们早出工，晚收工，积极为集体积肥、运肥，兴修水利，检修春耕农具，争取今年农业丰收。
    大队的民兵连既是文化革命的闯将和先锋，又是春耕生产的骨干和突击队。他们为了使“幸福渠”发挥更大的效益，主动承担了用石块修砌渠道的任务。队里运输工具不多，他们就把石头一块一块地背到工地。一些当年的老赤卫队员、老游击队员也积极投入春耕生产，决心为争取今年农业生产更大丰收立新功。
    现在，枣园大队的备耕工作已经接近完成。按计划，全大队全年共需用肥料三百九十多万斤，到目前为止，为春田和麦田追肥准备的肥料已近三百万斤。运肥、备犁、备耙等准备工作正在紧张进行，农田水利也在加紧整修。
