Title: Cheering for Revolutionary Cadres' "Appearance"

For seventeen years, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has been dominant, and the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. Comrade Wang Kun firmly stands on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and this is one of them. Those with ulterior motives slander the proletarian revolutionary faction as being "terrible," but he believes the proletarian revolutionary faction is excellent. Some say that cadres should be "impartial," but he believes cadres should firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Excellent! Revolutionary cadres should indeed be this resolute! We warmly welcome revolutionary cadres to step forward and "appear," and we cheer for this revolutionary "appearance"!

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution poses a stern question to many cadres: which side are you on? This is a question that cannot be avoided. In short, it is the question of whether one dares to step forward and "appear."

Comrade Wang Kun's example of rebelling tells us that this so-called "appearance" is nothing else but revolutionary cadres bravely stepping forward, publicly declaring their firm stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely exposing and thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, exposing the anti-party crimes of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, without hesitation, without reservation, without wavering, without compromise, appearing before the proletarian revolutionary faction, appearing before all revolutionary masses, and demonstrating this with concrete actions. If one must say "biased," then it is firmly "biased" towards the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The proletarian revolutionary faction should create conditions for revolutionary cadres to "appear" and remove ideological obstacles. Revolutionary cadres should not passively wait for others to pull them to "appear," but should actively "appear." They should actively align with the proletarian revolutionary faction, admit mistakes, open their hearts, and declare their revolutionary stance to the masses. If one does not take a clear stance to show a clean break with the bourgeois reactionary line, the masses will naturally doubt whether you are "leftist" or "rightist."

Some cadres are worried that even if they "appear," "others will still not believe me." The issue of whether the masses believe you mainly depends on how you present yourself to the masses. If you expose problems without reservation, thoroughly "appear" regarding your own issues, and have the determination and actions to correct them, then you can completely gain the understanding and trust of the masses.

Some revolutionary mass organizations in certain units do not sufficiently support the "appearance" of revolutionary cadres. Some cadres have clearly "appeared," but they still emphasize the need for "long-term verification," keeping them at arm's length. This is definitely not the attitude of a proletarian revolutionary. As long as revolutionary cadres are willing to step forward and "appear," we should all warmly welcome them. Revolutionary cadres "appearing" also creates conditions for carrying out the revolutionary struggle of "three-in-one" seizure of power. Every true proletarian revolutionary who prioritizes revolutionary interests and the overall revolutionary situation will naturally feel happy about this. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should adopt an attitude of persuasion, not exclusion, towards those who have made mistakes in their work, except for those who are beyond redemption, to help them change and start anew." Therefore, there is no reason to interfere with cadres' "appearance." Revolutionary cadres, under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely step forward and "appear"!

### 为革命领导干部的“亮相”喝采

    为革命领导干部的“亮相”喝采
    《文汇报》三月七日社论
    十七年来，毛主席的革命路线是占统治地位的，大多数干部是好的和比较好的。王坤同志坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，便是其中的一个。那些别有用心的人污蔑无产阶级革命派“糟得很”，他认为无产阶级革命派好得很。有人说领导干部应该“不偏不倚”，他认为领导干部应该坚决倒向无产阶级革命派一边。好！革命的领导干部就是应该这样一边倒！我们热烈地欢迎革命的领导干部站出来“亮相”，为这种革命的“亮相”喝采！
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命向许多领导干部提出了一个严峻的问题：你站在那一边？这是一个不能不回答的问题。简言之，就是敢不敢站出来“亮相”的问题。
    王坤同志起来造反的事例告诉我们，所谓“亮相”，不是别的，就是革命领导干部勇敢地站出来，公开表明自己坚决站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线这一边，坚决揭露、彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反党罪行，不含糊，不留情，不观望，不徘徊，不折中，向无产阶级革命派“亮相”，向一切革命群众“亮相”，用实际行动来表明这一点。如果要说“偏”的话，那就是坚决“偏”向无产阶级革命派一边。
    无产阶级革命派要为革命的领导干部“亮相”创造条件，扫除思想障碍。而革命的领导干部不要消极地等待别人拉去“亮相”，要主动“亮相”。积极向无产阶级革命派靠拢，承认错误，主动交心，向群众表明自己的革命立场。如果不用鲜明的态度，表明自己与资产阶级反动路线一刀两断，群众当然要疑惑你“姓左还是姓右了”。
    有些干部担心自己“亮”了“相”，而“人家总归不相信我”。群众相信不相信的问题，主要决定于自己以什么样的面貌与群众见面。如果你所揭露的问题无所保留，对自身的事情“亮”得彻底，又有改正的决心和行动，那是完全可以取得群众的谅解和信任的。
    有些单位的革命群众组织对革命的领导干部“亮相”支持不够，有的干部明明“亮”了“相”，他们却还在那里强调要“长期检验”，拒人于千里之外。这决不是无产阶级革命家应有的态度。凡是革命的领导干部愿意站出来“亮相”，我们都应当热情欢迎。革命的领导干部“亮”了“相”，也就为开展革命的“三结合”夺权斗争创造了条件。每一个以革命利益为重、以革命大局为重的真正无产阶级革命派，对此理所当然地感到高兴。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于在工作中犯过错误的人们，除了不可救药者外，不是采取排斥态度，而是采取规劝态度，使之翻然改进，弃旧图新。”因此，没有任何理由，去干扰领导干部的“亮相”。革命的领导干部，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，勇敢地站出来“亮相”吧！
