We must dare to strike back! Lu Xun dared to strike back, and we should learn from Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit to strike back!

Coming out from the old camp and then striking back in, we gain more strength. Striking back often catches the enemy off guard, frequently dealing a fatal blow to the enemy.

The revolutionary strike back is excellent! Some comrades, who were previously promoters of the bourgeois reactionary line, are familiar with the inner workings and know the secrets of the bourgeois reactionary line. Do you want to make a revolution? Then stand up and strike back fiercely! If not now, when?

To make a revolution, do not hesitate or be indecisive. Dare to strike back, strike until the bayonets clash. To make a revolution, dare to touch your own soul. Why be shy and hesitant?

Currently, some who were once deceived are now fiercely counterattacking. They possess the spirit of striking back and are exposing the bourgeois reactionary line. We firmly support these comrades' revolutionary actions.

Those who were once deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, wake up! Learn from those who dare to strike back and fiercely oppose the bourgeois reactionary line!

The proletarian revolutionary line, with Chairman Mao as its representative, will surely triumph, and the bourgeois reactionary line will surely be thoroughly destroyed.

    要敢于杀回马枪
    冲天啸
    鲁迅会杀回马枪，我们要学习鲁迅的革命精神，杀回马枪！
    从旧的营垒中间出来，再杀回去，就更有力量。杀回马枪，往往杀得敌人措手不及，常常致强敌于死命。
    革命的回马枪，好得很！有些同志，过去是资产阶级反动路线的推行者，对资产阶级反动路线，熟悉内情，知道老底。你们要革命吗？那就站出来，猛杀回马枪吧，现在不杀，更待何时？
    要革命，就不要忸忸怩怩，欲言又止，要敢于杀回去，杀个刺刀见红。要革命，就得敢于触及自己的灵魂，又何必羞羞答答，患得患失呢？
    目前，一些受过蒙蔽的人开始反戈猛击了。他们具有杀回马枪的精神，大揭资产阶级反动路线。我们坚决支持这些同志的革命行动。
    一时糊涂受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的人，你们该猛醒了！应该向敢于杀回马枪的人学习，大造资产阶级反动路线的反！
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线必然胜利，资产阶级反动路线必然被彻底摧毁。
