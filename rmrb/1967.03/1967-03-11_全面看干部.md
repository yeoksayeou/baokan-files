	For cadres who have made mistakes, we should not “focus on one aspect and ignore the rest.”

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “In evaluating a person’s work, we must make an overall assessment. If the work is 70% correct and 30% wrong, then we should basically affirm the work. To say that the mistakes are the main part while the achievements are secondary is completely wrong.” In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the same principle applies to dealing with cadres who have made mistakes. If we “focus on” the “30%” mistakes of a cadre and deny their “70%” achievements, wiping them out completely, this is a grave error.

	Chairman Mao also teaches us: “We must not only look at a cadre’s actions at a particular time and in a particular matter, but also at the cadre’s entire history and all their work. This is the main method for identifying cadres.” Cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who persist in their errors and refuse to be reformed, should be allowed to correct their mistakes and be encouraged to make amends. If we only “focus on” the fact that these cadres have made mistakes at a certain time or in a certain matter, ignoring their history of several decades of revolutionary struggle and work, and condemn them outright, this is also a grave error.

	The correct attitude towards cadre issues is: we must see both the “one aspect” and the “rest.” If we do not see the “one aspect” and ignore the cadre’s erroneous tendencies, not pointing them out, not criticizing them, and not helping them correct the “one aspect,” the errors may develop to a serious extent. On the other hand, if we exaggerate the “one aspect” and “ignore the rest,” we will see only the trees and not the forest, which is neither realistic nor conducive to making cadres who have made mistakes sincerely repent.

	Seeing the “one aspect” means taking a strict yet warm attitude towards a comrade’s shortcomings and mistakes, not indulging or tolerating them; “considering the rest” means making a comprehensive, historical, and scientific analysis and evaluation of the cadre.

	We proletarian revolutionaries, in dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, must both “see the one aspect” and “consider the rest” to achieve the dual purpose of “clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades.” Only in this way can we unite with the majority of cadres and, to the greatest extent possible, isolate and strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

    全面看干部
    北京床单厂红色造反者
    对于犯错误的干部，不能“抓住一点，不及其余”。
    毛主席教导我们说：“一个人的工作，究竟是三分成绩七分错误，还是七分成绩三分错误，必须有个根本的估计。如果是七分成绩，那末就应该对他的工作基本上加以肯定。把成绩为主说成错误为主，那就完全错了。”在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，对待犯错误的干部也是这样。如果我们“抓住”干部的“三分”错误这“一点”，否定他们“七分”成绩的“其余”，一笔抹煞，这是极端错误的。
    毛主席又教导我们说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”犯错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。如果我们只“抓住”这些干部某一时或某一事犯了错误这“一点”，不顾及他们几十年革命斗争的历史和工作的“其余”，对他们一棍子打死，这也是极端错误的。
    看待干部问题的正确态度是：既要看到“一点”，又要顾及“其余”。不看“一点”，忽视干部的错误倾向，不指出，不批评，不帮助改正这“一点”，错误就可能发展到严重的地步。反之，夸大“一点”，“不及其余”，就会只见树木，不见森林，既不实事求是，也不能使犯有错误的干部心悦诚服。
    看到“一点”，就是对一个同志的缺点和错误，采取严格而又热情帮助的态度，不姑息，不纵容；“顾及其余”，就是要对干部作全面的、历史的、科学的分析和评价。
    我们无产阶级革命派对待犯错误的干部，只有既“看到一点”，又“顾及其余”，才能达到“既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的”。也只有这样，才能团结广大干部，最大限度地孤立与打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
