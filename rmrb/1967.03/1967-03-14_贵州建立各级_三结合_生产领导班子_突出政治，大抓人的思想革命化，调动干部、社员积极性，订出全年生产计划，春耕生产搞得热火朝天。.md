Guizhou has established "three-in-one" production leadership teams at all levels. Focusing on politics, it emphasizes the ideological transformation of the people, mobilizes the enthusiasm of cadres and community members, and formulates annual production plans. Spring plowing is in full swing.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) — The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in Guizhou Province have responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have earnestly implemented the spirit of the letter from the Party Central Committee to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country. With the support of local military units and county military departments, revolutionary organizations at the prefecture (district), county, and commune levels have thoroughly discussed and negotiated, and have universally established "three-in-one" production leadership teams at all levels. Spring plowing is in full swing.

The day after the Party Central Committee's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country was issued, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately held a provincial telephone conference. It called on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels to mobilize all forces with a "seize the day" spirit to immediately launch a spring plowing production campaign. All seven prefectures (districts), 80 counties, and more than 4,070 people's communes in the province have seriously studied and discussed the letter, promptly implemented it, and successively established "three-in-one" production leadership teams consisting of representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives from local military units (militia representatives at the commune level).

The "three-in-one" production leadership teams at all levels in Guizhou Province have faithfully handed over the Party Central Committee's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country to the masses. During the study and discussion, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were moved to say: "The Party Central Committee's letter is like a timely rain and a spring thunder." "Chairman Mao seems to be always by our side, understanding the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants the most, and every word is in our hearts." The great spiritual force has been transformed into a tremendous material force. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have fully played their leading role. They are hardworking, selfless, and fighting on the front lines of spring plowing production. At present, the province has seen a high tide of spring plowing production, and all work is more solid than last year. Early-season crops are growing well and are expected to increase significantly. The preparation of base fertilizer for late-season crops is also good. Production teams are concentrating their efforts on building small-scale water conservancy projects and launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign.

Recently, all communes in the province have held three-level cadre meetings, focusing on solving cadres' ideological problems. This year's commune three-level cadre meetings have placed the study of Chairman Mao's works and the improvement of ideological awareness in the first place. Through the active study and application of the "Three Old Articles," the cadres have touched their souls and put down their ideological burdens. They excitedly said: "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee trust us so highly, and as long as we have a breath, we will do revolution!" After the three-level cadre meetings, the vast majority of cadres at all levels in the rural areas of the province have done a good job of humbly listening to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants and accepting criticism from the masses; they have also taken the initiative to arrange spring plowing production.

On the basis of focusing on politics and emphasizing the ideological transformation of the people, the "three-in-one" production leadership teams at all levels in the rural areas of the province have begun to implement this year's production plans. Many communes and production teams have discussed and formulated annual production plans through repeated discussions from the bottom up. They have specifically arranged for the current work of fertilizer accumulation, building small-scale water conservancy projects, and strengthening the management of early-season crops. This has further mobilized the enthusiasm of cadres and community members to be masters of their own affairs. A movement of learning from each other, helping each other, and catching up with each other is gradually forming between communes and production teams, greatly promoting the current spring plowing production.

	In the spring plowing production high tide, the revolutionary peasants of the Dazhai Brigade, Huaxi Commune, Guiyang City, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide spring plowing production. This is them studying Chairman Mao's quotations in the field.

    贵州建立各级“三结合”生产领导班子
    突出政治，大抓人的思想革命化，调动干部、社员积极性，订出全年生产计划，春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    本报讯　贵州省广大贫下中农和各级干部，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，认真贯彻党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信的精神，各专（州）、县、公社在当地驻军和县武装部的支持下，经过革命组织的充分酝酿、协商，普遍建立了各级“三结合”的生产领导班子，春耕生产出现了热火朝天的新局面。
    党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信发出的第二天，贵州省革命委员会立即召开了全省电话会议，要求广大贫下中农和各级干部用“只争朝夕”的精神，动员一切力量立即掀起春耕生产高潮。全省七个专（州）、八十个县、四千零七十多个人民公社都认真学习讨论，及时贯彻，相继建立起有革命群众组织代表、革命领导干部、人民解放军当地驻军代表（公社是民兵代表）参加的“三结合”的生产领导班子。
    贵州省各级“三结合”生产领导班子原原本本地把党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信交给群众。广大贫下中农在学习讨论时激动地说：党中央的信是“及时雨”，是“春雷”。“毛主席好象随时都在自己身边，最了解我们贫下中农的心，句句话都说在我们心坎上。”伟大的精神力量已经转化为巨大的物质力量，广大贫下中农充分发挥了骨干作用，他们吃苦耐劳，舍己为公，战斗在春耕生产第一线上。目前，全省已经出现了春耕生产高潮，各项活路做得都比去年扎实。小季作物长势良好，可望大幅度增产。大季作物需要的底肥准备的情况也很好。各生产队正在集中力量兴修小型水利，开展积肥运动。
    最近，全省各公社都开了三级干部会，集中力量解决干部的思想问题。今年的公社三级干部会把学习毛主席著作，提高思想觉悟放到第一位。广大干部通过活学活用“老三篇”，触及灵魂，放下了思想上的包袱。他们激动地说：“毛主席和党中央这样高度信任我们，我们只要有口气，就要干革命！”三干会后，全省农村各级干部绝大多数都做到了一面虚心听取贫下中农意见，接受群众批评；一面挺身而出，主动地安排春耕生产。
    在突出政治，大抓人的思想革命化的基础上，全省农村各级“三结合”生产领导班子都开始抓今年生产计划的落实工作。不少社队都经过自下而上的反复讨论，订出了全年的生产计划，具体安排了当前积肥、兴修小型水利和加强小季作物管理等工作，这样就更进一步地调动了干部、社员当家作主的积极性，一个社与社之间，队与队之间的比学赶帮运动正在逐步形成，大大地促进了当前的春耕生产。（附图片）
    贵阳市花溪公社大寨大队的革命农民在春耕生产高潮中，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指导春耕生产。这是他们在田头学习毛主席语录。
