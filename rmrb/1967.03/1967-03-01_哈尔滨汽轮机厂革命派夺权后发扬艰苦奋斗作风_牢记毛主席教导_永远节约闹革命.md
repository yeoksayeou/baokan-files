The revolutionary faction of the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory, after seizing power, firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching to "be thrifty and make revolution." They resolutely fight against the "self" in their minds, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and thrift in making revolution. Revolution and production are both flourishing, presenting a new situation.

When the Red Rebel Corps of the Steam Turbine Factory was first established, a handful of capitalists within the party used various means to restrict their activities. The capitalist roaders in power did not provide them with paper, ink, or pens, so they collected money to buy their own. They were not given a place to meet, so after much difficulty, they found a basement, and a broken ping-pong table served as their office desk. Without transportation, they rode their own bicycles, and even walked to connect and propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

After seizing power, the status of the Red Rebels changed, and some people began to have thoughts of showing off and flaunting their wealth.

Some said: "In terms of the size of the factory, ours is one of the largest in the city; in terms of revolution, we are not inferior. Now the rebel headquarters is still in this basement, which is not appropriate. Let's move to a big building." Others said: "We don't ride in cars, but we can buy a motorcycle, which will be convenient for connecting and propagating." And so on. In response to these active thoughts, the Red Rebels engaged in fierce debates. They first studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions.

Chairman Mao taught us: "There may be some communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns, who are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets."

Chairman Mao instructed: "Be thrifty and make revolution."

Chairman Mao's teachings raised the awareness of the Red Rebels. They said: "Our victory in seizing power is only the first step of a long march. We must be vigilant against the enemy's counterattack within the factory and be vigilant against being defeated by sugar-coated bullets." "Although there are sofas, swivel chairs, and carpets in the office building, our basement has the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle by the Red Rebels." Everyone realized that as long as there is a thought of seeking enjoyment in one's mind, it is a dangerous signal of "peaceful evolution." Therefore, they must not only be vigilant against the enemy's counterattack within the factory but also prevent the "enemy" from attacking their minds. They decided not to move to the big building, not to ride in small cars, not to buy motorcycles, and to continue to make revolution with thrift. From then on, the comrades in the headquarters set an example, sharing both hardships and joys with the masses, and not engaging in special treatment. Once, Comrade Zhao Bingshan of the headquarters went to the Harbin Workers' Red Rebel Headquarters for a meeting. After the meeting, it was already late at night, and there were no more trams. His fellow comrades who went to the meeting together suggested he call the factory to send a car to pick him up. He thought, I can't do that. Hard struggle is the tradition of the working class. So he walked twenty miles back to the factory.

The Red Rebels carefully calculate and save every piece of paper and every penny of the state. So far, the expenses of the Red Rebel Corps have only been the equivalent of six monthly bus tickets. Their spirit of hard work, simplicity, and thrift in making revolution has even won the respect of the conservative faction who previously opposed them.

Since seizing power, the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory Red Rebel Corps has followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "be thrifty and make revolution." They have reformed the organization, established a new team to promote revolution and production, and the enthusiasm of the workers for production has doubled. A type of large steam turbine they produced was delayed for three months due to the sabotage of the capitalist roaders within the factory. After seizing power, the revolutionary masses carried forward the revolutionary spirit, launched technological innovation activities, tapped into production potential, and quickly and well completed the task.

    哈尔滨汽轮机厂革命派夺权后发扬艰苦奋斗作风
    牢记毛主席教导　永远节约闹革命
    本报讯　哈尔滨汽轮机厂红色造反者在夺权以后，牢记毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，继续发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约闹革命的作风，革命、生产蒸蒸日上，出现了崭新的局面。
    汽轮机厂红色造反团刚刚成立的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，用种种手段限制他们的活动。走资本主义道路当权派不给他们纸张、笔墨，他们就自己凑钱买。不给活动用的房间，他们几经周折，找了个地下室，一张破乒乓球台就是他们的办公桌。没有交通工具，他们就骑自己的自行车，甚至步行进行串连和宣传毛泽东思想。
    夺权以后，红色造反者的地位改变了，有一些人的头脑中开始滋长讲排场、摆阔气的思想。
    有的说：“论厂子大小，咱们厂也是全市数得着的；论革命，咱们也不差。现在造反团总部还在这个地下室里，也太不象话了，搬到大楼里去吧。”有的说：“咱们不坐汽车，就买辆摩托车，搞串连也方便。”等等。针对这些活思想，红色造反者进行了激烈的争论。他们首先学习了毛主席的有关指示。
    毛主席教导我们说：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”
    毛主席指示说：“要节约闹革命。”
    毛主席的教导提高了红色造反者的认识。他们说：“我们夺权胜利了，只是万里长征的第一步，要警惕厂里敌人的反扑，要警惕被糖衣炮弹打倒。”“办公大楼里虽然有沙发、转椅、地毯，但我们的地下室里却有红色造反者艰苦奋斗的革命传统。”大家认识到，只要自己脑子里一有贪图享受的念头，就是“和平演变”的危险信号。因此，不但要警惕厂内敌人的反扑，也要防止脑子里“敌人”的进攻。他们决定不住大楼，不坐小汽车，不买摩托车，继续勤俭闹革命。从此，总部的同志以身作则，与群众同甘共苦，不搞特殊化。有一次，总部的赵炳山同志到哈尔滨工人红色造反者总司令部开会，散会后已是深夜，电车也没有了。同去开会的同志劝他打电话，叫厂里派汽车来接他。他想，我不能这么办，艰苦奋斗才是工人阶级的传统。于是他步行二十里路回到工厂。
    红色造反者对国家的一张纸、一文钱，都精打细算，节约使用。到目前为止，红色造反团的经费开支只有六张公共汽车月票那么多。他们这种艰苦朴素、节约闹革命的作风，连过去反对他们的保守派也不得不表示佩服。
    夺权以来，哈尔滨汽轮机厂红色造反团遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，改革了机构，成立了新的抓革命、促生产班子，广大工人生产劲头倍增。他们生产的一种大型汽轮机，由于厂内走资本主义道路当权派的破坏，一直拖了三个月没有完工。夺权以后，革命群众发扬革命精神，开展技术革新活动，挖掘生产潜力，又快又好地完成了任务。
