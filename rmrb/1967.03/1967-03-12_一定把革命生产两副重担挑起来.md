I am fifty-four years old, an old woman team leader. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the community members once posted two big-character posters about me. At first, I thought, at my age, I work with the young people all year round, running around day and night for the team's affairs, and in the end, I got criticized. What's the point? My home is full of children, even if I don't work, there's enough to eat and drink! The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt.

Whenever I encounter something I can't understand, I ask my granddaughter to read some quotations from Chairman Mao to me. Chairman Mao said: "Because we are serving the people, we should welcome criticism from all quarters." After hearing Chairman Mao's words, my heart became clear. Being a team leader is to serve the people. Serving the people does not depend on age, nor should one fear criticism. Chairman Mao said: "No matter who points out our shortcomings, we should welcome them. If you are right, we will correct them. If your methods benefit the people, we will follow them." After hearing Chairman Mao's words, I not only did not fear big-character posters but also asked people to give me suggestions. This way, my heart became even closer to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and my enthusiasm increased. When the spring plowing season arrived, a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road secretly colluded with bad elements to incite conflicts between community members and cadres, making cadres throw down their responsibilities and disrupt spring plowing production. Our brigade had a few cadres who, for a time, did not see clearly and dared not take charge, making the brigade's leading cadre group almost "paralyzed." I saw this situation and felt it was very wrong. Chairman Mao repeatedly called on us to grasp revolution and promote production, but someone wanted to sabotage the leading cadre group and affect the production of the entire brigade. This shows that class struggle also exists in spring plowing production. I am a poor peasant woman with deep bitterness. I remember when I joined the Party, I clenched my fist and swore: I will follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution. Now that the enemy is causing trouble and trying to undermine our socialist foundation, we must not agree, and we must fight to the death to make Chairman Mao proud and bring glory to the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must definitely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

I closely united with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's works together, raised everyone's class consciousness, and correctly recognized and treated cadres, striving to take charge of the team's production. I also went to the brigade to help with the work. The entire brigade's several production teams, I ran day and night, almost covering every corner, helping to strengthen the leading cadre group, busy enough not to have time to eat. I also shared my process of changing my thoughts with the cadres, helping them overcome their personalistic thoughts of gain and loss, and work actively. There was a team leader who was a poor peasant. The community members gave him some suggestions, and he felt that being a cadre was not worth it and did not want to do it anymore. I studied Chairman Mao's quotations with him: "The main force that has been fighting hard in the countryside is the poor peasants," "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution," and analyzed the current class struggle situation. This made him realize: whether or not to be a cadre is not just a personal matter but a big deal about who holds the reins. If we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, throw down our responsibilities, aren't we falling into the enemy's trap? After his thoughts turned around, he worked very hard!

Now, the leading cadre groups at all levels in our brigade that grasp revolution and promote production have all been strengthened, and the preparations for spring plowing and sowing are better than in previous years.

    一定把革命生产两副重担挑起来
    辽宁金县三十里堡公社工农兵大队第二生产队妇女队长  孔玉梅
    我今年五十四岁了，是个老妇女队长。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，社员们曾给我贴了两张大字报。开始我想，我这么大年岁了，一年到头和小青年们在一起干，为了队里的事情，没明没夜的跑前跑后，到头来还落了一身不是，这是何苦呢？我家儿女满堂，就是不干活也够吃够喝呀！越想心里越别扭。
    一遇到想不通的事，我就叫俺孙女来给我念几条毛主席语录。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”听了毛主席的话，心里亮堂了。当队长就是为人民服务，为人民服务，既不能论年岁大小，更不能怕别人批评。毛主席他老人家说：“不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”听了毛主席的话，我不但不怕贴大字报，反而要求人家给我提意见。这样一来，我和广大贫下中农社员的心贴得更紧了，干劲也更足了。在进入春耕大忙时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在暗地里勾结坏人，挑拨社员与干部的关系，让干部撂挑子，破坏春耕生产。我们大队有几个干部一时没看清，也不敢管事了，使大队的领导班子几乎成了“瘫子”。我一看这种情况觉得很不对头。毛主席一而再、再而三地叫咱们抓革命，促生产，而有人要搞垮领导班子，影响全大队的生产，这说明，在春耕生产中也同样存在着阶级斗争。我是一个苦大仇深的贫农妇女。记得入党时，俺攥起拳头宣誓：要跟毛主席革命到底。现在有敌人在捣鬼，想挖我们社会主义的墙脚，我们无论如何也不答应，拚上命也要为毛主席争气，为贫下中农争光，一定要把革命、生产两副重担挑起来。
    我紧紧地和贫下中农团结在一起，共同学习毛主席著作，提高大家的阶级觉悟，正确地认识和对待干部，尽力抓起全队的生产。我还跑到大队帮助工作。全大队几个生产队，我白天黑夜地跑，几乎跑了个遍，帮助健全领导班子，忙得顾不上吃饭。我还把自己思想转变的过程讲给干部们听，帮助他们克服患得患失的个人主义思想，积极工作。有个队长是个贫农，社员给他提了意见，他觉得当干部没落头，不愿干了。我和他一起学习了毛主席的语录：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农”，“没有贫农便没有革命”，并且分析了当前阶级斗争的形势。使他认识到：当不当干部，不只是个人的事，而是关系到谁来掌印把子的大事。咱贫下中农扔下挑子，不正是上了阶级敌人的当吗？思想扭过了弯，他干得可起劲哩！
    现在，我们大队抓革命，促生产的各级领导班子都健全了，春耕播种的准备工作做得比往年好。
