With the spring plowing season approaching, the Licheng County in Shandong Province established a county-level first-line command department for spring agricultural production. The leadership members participating in the production command department include representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, deputy county party secretaries, deputy county magistrates, and responsible officials from the county military affairs department.

Currently, the county production command department has dispatched over a thousand people to the front lines of spring plowing. They are assisting various communes, brigades, and production teams in establishing and strengthening production leadership teams. They are using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, implementing production plans, and focusing on increasing production. From top to bottom in the county, the command channels are smooth, and a new wave of spring plowing production has been launched.

After the establishment of the Licheng County production command department, a meeting of county, district, and commune-level cadres was convened. The meeting extensively propagated the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Throughout the Country," ensuring that Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The production command department also arranged the agricultural production plan for the year at the three-level cadre meeting.

Cadres who went deep into the spring plowing front lines, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "after the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor," first concentrated their efforts on helping the communes hold good three-level cadre meetings. They assisted the communes and brigades in establishing or strengthening leadership teams for spring plowing production. They also organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres to study Chairman Mao's quotations on cadre issues, helping them understand and grasp Mao's cadre policies, and assisting cadres in correctly recognizing and addressing their own issues. Through meticulous ideological work, the masses were mobilized, and the cadres were educated. Various communes, brigades, and production teams universally established leadership teams to grasp revolution and promote production.

Because the cadres' and masses' ideological issues were resolved in a timely manner and the leadership teams were solidly established, the broad masses of commune members and cadres had high political enthusiasm and worked with great vigor. The entire county launched a new wave of spring plowing production.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "concentrating forces to win a decisive victory," the command department concentrated the county's manpower, material resources, and financial resources on the front lines of spring plowing production. Comrades from the industrial, commercial, financial, agricultural, and forestry departments, after reading the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Throughout the Country," rushed to the grassroots levels to support spring plowing production. The county supply and marketing cooperatives, commerce bureau, finance bureau, and other units of the proletarian revolutionary factions, on the one hand, carried out the Cultural Revolution within their own units, and on the other hand, adjusted the necessary agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other materials to the grassroots levels, ensuring supply.

The comrades in the command department, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "caring for the people's livelihood," on the one hand, propagated "thrift for revolution," and on the other hand, assisted the commune and brigade cadres in reasonably arranging the livelihood of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members, enabling them to devote their full energy to spring plowing production.

    本报讯　在春耕大忙即将来到之时，山东省历城县建立了县一级春耕生产第一线指挥部。参加生产指挥部的领导成员有革命群众组织的代表，县委副书记、副县长、县武装部负责人。
    目前，县生产指挥部已派出千余人深入春耕第一线，帮助各公社、大队和生产队建立和健全生产领导班子，以毛泽东思想统帅生产，依靠贫下中农，落实生产计划，狠抓增产措施。全县从上到下，指挥渠道畅通，春耕生产掀起了新高潮。
    历城县生产指挥部成立以后，召开了县、区、社三级干部会议，大力宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，使毛主席、党中央“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，深入人心。生产指挥部在三级干部会上，还布置了今年的农业生产计划。
    深入春耕第一线加强领导的干部，根据毛主席关于“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”的教导，首先集中力量帮助公社开好三级干部会议，帮助公社、大队建立或健全领导春耕生产的班子。他们还组织贫下中农和基层干部学习毛主席有关干部问题的语录，领会和掌握毛主席的干部政策，帮助干部正确认识和对待自己的问题。经过深入细致的思想工作，发动了群众，教育了干部。各公社、大队和生产队普遍建立了抓革命、促生产的领导班子。
    由于干部和群众的思想问题解决得及时，领导班子落实得好，广大社员群众和干部的政治积极性很高，干活劲头很足，全县掀起了春耕生产的新高潮。
    根据毛主席“集中兵力一战而胜”的教导，指挥部将全县的人力、物力、财力集中使用到春耕生产第一线。工交、财贸、农林等部门的同志，看到《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》后，纷纷深入基层，支援春耕生产。县供销社、商业局、财政局等单位的无产阶级革命派，一方面搞好本单位的文化大革命，一方面将春耕生产急用的农具、种子、肥料、农药等物资调到基层，保证供应。
    指挥部的同志，还根据毛主席“关心群众生活”的教导，一面宣传“要节约闹革命”，一面协助社队干部合理安排贫下中农和广大社员的生活，使他们全力以赴投入春耕生产。
