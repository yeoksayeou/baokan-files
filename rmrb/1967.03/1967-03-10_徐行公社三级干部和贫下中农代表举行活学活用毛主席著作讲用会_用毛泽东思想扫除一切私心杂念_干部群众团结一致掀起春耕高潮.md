Xuxing Commune's three-level cadres and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants held a study session on applying Chairman Mao's works. Using Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate all selfish thoughts, cadres and the masses unite to launch a spring plowing high tide.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 9 -- The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Xuxing Commune, Jiading County, Shanghai, have resolutely responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They have mobilized all forces and activated all positive factors to seize the revolution and promote production, rapidly launching a spring plowing production high tide. Currently, field management and preparatory work for spring plowing are proceeding smoothly.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this commune increasingly realize that to do a good job in spring plowing, they must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the great alliance and unity of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. To achieve this, the key issue is the cadres. Because cadres bear heavy responsibilities in spring plowing, and among the cadres, there are various kinds of active thoughts. If these problems are not solved, they will affect production and work. Xuxing Commune, in view of this situation, recently held a meeting attended by cadres and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants at the commune, production brigade, and production team levels. They organized everyone to bring their problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, holding a study session. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses exposed their thoughts, discussed viewpoints, and shared their understanding, achieving the goal of mutual openness, unified understanding, and raised awareness. Thus, revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary cadres further united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, working together to seize the revolution and promote production.

Below are excerpts from some cadres and community members' speeches at this study session.

Class Analysis of Cadres, Distinguish Between Them

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Representative Li Ailin said:

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Only when the enthusiasm of the leading cadres is combined with the enthusiasm of the broad masses will there be no mere bustling about on the part of a few individuals. But if there is only the enthusiasm of the broad masses and no strong leading cadres to organize the enthusiasm of the masses properly, then such enthusiasm will not last long nor will it take the correct direction and reach a high level." Chairman Mao's teachings should be the criterion for us to view and handle the relationship between cadres and the masses.

Recently, the Party Central Committee wrote to us, calling on us to "seriously seize the revolution, promote production, mobilize all forces, and immediately work hard to do a good job in spring plowing." The enthusiasm of our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants is very high. We must do a good job in the revolution and spring plowing. As for the cadres, the Party Central Committee made it very clear in the letter to us: "The cadres at all levels of rural people's communes are mostly good or relatively good." From the situation of our commune's cadres, it is the same. Except for a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who are in power, the majority are good or relatively good. Some of them have made this or that mistake and have this or that shortcoming. But these all belong to the contradictions within the people and can be resolved with the policy of "unity-criticism-unity." We hope that these comrades with shortcomings and mistakes will stand up, work hard, and make amends in spring plowing production. As long as you are willing to listen to the opinions of the masses, admit mistakes, and work hard to correct them, we poor and lower-middle peasants will trust you and support your work.

We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most and love Chairman Mao the most. We do as Chairman Mao says, without any discounts or conditions. We believe that as long as we all listen to Chairman Mao and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will definitely be able to seize the revolution, promote production, complete the glorious tasks given to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and fight a brilliant battle in spring plowing production.

Don't Retreat, Be a Vanguard

Small Temple Brigade Leader Lu Wanxing said:

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a test for everyone, for every cadre. At first, I only thought about overthrowing others, not realizing that I too had to pass the test of socialism in my thoughts. I always thought that I was a cadre who came to power after the "Four Cleanups" movement, had been brigade leader for a short time, was young, and had not made any big mistakes in my work. I thought that this movement would not have much impact on me. I never imagined that once the movement started, the masses would paste many big-character posters on me, raising many criticisms. I thought, I often heard people say that cadres have no head to hit, and it's true. I really wanted to quit and just be an ordinary community member, without any trouble. Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." Comparing myself, I felt ashamed. The masses trusted me and elected me as a cadre, but I wanted to retreat after just a few days of work. This is ungrateful to the Party and Chairman Mao, ungrateful to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Thinking of this, I further studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" Chairman Mao's words seemed to be addressed to me. From then on, I no longer resented the masses pasting big-character posters on me. I realized that this was the masses' care and help for us cadres, so that we could better serve the people. I should accept the masses' criticism and help in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I changed my past undemocratic style, humbly listened to the opinions of the masses, adopted the good ones, and explained the wrong ones. As a result, the masses were satisfied, and the work was better than before. Recently, the Party Central Committee's letter to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in rural areas has greatly encouraged me. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution and promote production with the masses, and fire the first shot of spring plowing, contributing to furthering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Believe in the Masses, Believe in the Party's Policies

Small Temple Brigade's Seventh Production Team Leader Ji Zhaohua said:

I became the production team leader after the "Four Cleanups" movement, and I have only been in office for eight months. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I heard someone distorting it as a "demotion movement," saying that all those in power would be "pulled down," and that "big cadres would be big demotions, small cadres would be small demotions." At that time, the mass movement here also rose quickly and fiercely. Under such circumstances, I was a bit afraid, daring not to seize production, even seeing community members made me a bit afraid, fearing that the next step would be aimed at me. At that time, I set a rule for myself: work should be done, but words should be few, to avoid being caught by others.

After a while, the masses did not paste many big-character posters on me, and I was a bit surprised. Calming down, I studied the policies of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and realized that the focus of the rural Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to criticize a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements who have not been reformed. This made my mind much clearer, and the knots in my thoughts were untied. Talking with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I realized that they were not going to overthrow all cadres, and this was completely a tactic used by those capitalist-roaders within the Party to protect themselves and a rumor spread by those landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements who have not been reformed. They tried to sow discord between revolutionary cadres and the masses and sabotage our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Do I have any shortcomings or mistakes in my work? Of course, I do. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Since we are serving the people, we have no reason to fear criticism and pointing out our mistakes. No matter who it is, as long as you point out our mistakes, we will correct them. If your method is good for the people, we will follow your lead." This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a good opportunity for the masses to give me advice and help me, burning away the diseases in my thoughts, so that I can do my work better in the future. Once my thoughts were enlightened, everything became clear, and all worries and shame were thrown away. I was no longer afraid of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, no longer afraid of the masses pasting big-character posters on me, but felt that this was the greatest help and care from the masses.

Now, the Party Central Committee has written to us poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres, calling on us to seize the revolution and promote production, and to fully engage in spring plowing. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to shoulder the double burdens of revolution and production, achieving a double harvest of revolution and production. Because my thoughts are clear, my eyes are bright, and I work with full vigor, the community members also get along well with me, and our brigade's revolution and production are going well.

Go to the Masses, Stand on the Side of the Revolutionary People

Pingmin Brigade Party Branch Secretary Xuan Zhendong said:

In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, my thoughts were completely contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. The revolutionary masses pasted big-character posters on me and held meetings to criticize my mistakes in the movement and work, which touched my soul, and I couldn't stand it. I only thought of my good side: I am from a poor peasant family, suffered a lot since I was young, and it was only because of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that I stood up. How could I not follow the Party closely? In short, no matter how many mistakes there were, they were all wrong because of the "power" word. I thought: I don't need the revolutionary masses to seize power from me, I am willing to "hand over power." During that time, I was "angry when I went out and frustrated when I returned home," and I was very depressed.

What should I do? I can't go on like this! I often pay attention to listening to the radio broadcasts and reading newspaper editorials because they have Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao said: "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." Chairman Mao wants me to go to the masses, so I listen to his words and go to the masses. This gave me a great education. Some community members said: Chairman Mao in Beijing has very clear eyes, as long as you revolutionize, your mind will be firm. Some community members said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is really good, without this cultural revolution, our country might change color. I thought: Why do the community members welcome the cultural revolution so much, while I am so depressed? I brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counterrevolutionary. Whoever only stands on the side of the revolutionary people in words but acts differently is a verbal revolutionary, and if he stands on the side of the revolutionary people in both words and deeds, he is a complete revolutionary." I also studied the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Chairman Mao made it very clear, my various wrong thoughts, in a word, were because my standpoint was still problematic. I did not completely stand on the side of the revolutionary people, so I saw the same problem differently, and many things seemed irritating to me.

When my emotions were not right, it was hard to read the "Three Articles," but after my standpoint changed, it was easier to "digest." I am serving the people, why not welcome the masses' criticism and pointing out my mistakes? This doesn't make sense. Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you don't beat them, they won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor, if the broom doesn't reach, the dust will not run away by itself." This cultural revolution, with a surge, swept out the dirty thoughts in my brain, and once they came out, I could disinfect them accurately. The poor and lower-middle peasants had long told me that they were not going to beat me into a rightist, but to beat me into a leftist. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that this sentence was affectionate, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was really good.

Now, Chairman Mao calls on us to "seize the revolution and promote production," I will definitely stand with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, make a big fuss about the revolution, make a big fuss about production, and correct my shortcomings and mistakes in actual struggles.

Put Down the Burden, March Lightly

Xuxing Commune Deputy Director Dai Renlin said:

In the previous stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I unconsciously executed a capitalist reactionary line and made mistakes. My mood was very heavy, and I decided to sincerely check with the revolutionary masses. But how did the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the commune Party Committee think? They wanted to keep their "official hats," pushing us to the "front line," letting us represent the commune Party Committee to participate in the criticism meetings held by various units, so that they could slip away. This plot was quickly exposed by the revolutionary masses, and they were criticized. This incident gave me a great education. The revolutionary masses grasp the Party's policies and the direction of the struggle, they are reasonable. However, another thought flashed in my mind. I am also one of the cadres in power, and in the past, I participated in the study of some things. At that time, I did not resist, and now I stand up to expose them. Those guys will definitely say: "Hey, why didn't you speak up then? Shooting from the hip, currying favor with the revolutionary masses, truly two-faced." Moreover, I was also considering, if these people are not overthrown, how will we work together in the future? Let's wait and see.

When I was hesitating, Chairman Mao's book pointed out the direction for me. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot give up, any mistakes that we cannot abandon?" Chairman Mao's words made me think of my past. I worked for the capitalists since I was young, suffering oppression, exploitation, and bullying. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who saved me from the fire pit. For the liberation of us poor people, countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their precious lives. Today, we are facing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a life-and-death class struggle concerning whether our country will change color. At this critical moment, why do I have so many personal interests that I cannot give up? I must put down the burden and march lightly.

After the struggle in my thoughts, I bravely stood up to expose the problems and opened fire on the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses warmly welcomed my actions and strongly supported me. However, that small handful of people with guilty consciences spoke coldly to me, making sarcastic remarks. Their meaning was that you are not clean yourself, and someone is going to criticize you. You are busy criticizing us! Be careful, it might be your turn! Under such pressure, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings again: "A thorough materialist is fearless.... 'Dare to be beheaded, dare to pull the emperor off his horse'..." I indeed made mistakes, and I must check with the revolutionary masses. At the same time, because I made mistakes in the past, I must stand with the masses, do a good job in the revolution, and work hard to make amends. I will act according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, both treating myself as a force for the revolution and constantly treating myself as an object of the revolution, forever following Chairman Mao to make the revolution.

Currently, the busy season for spring plowing has arrived. I will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," dare to work, dare to take responsibility, and shoulder the burdens of revolution and production. I will strive to build Xuxing Commune into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    徐行公社三级干部和贫下中农代表举行活学活用毛主席著作讲用会
    用毛泽东思想扫除一切私心杂念  干部群众团结一致掀起春耕高潮
    据新华社上海九日电　上海市嘉定县徐行公社的广大贫下中农革命派和革命干部，坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，动员一切力量，调动一切积极因素，抓革命，促生产，迅速掀起春耕生产高潮，当前田间管理和备耕工作正在顺利进行。
    这个公社的广大贫下中农革命派和革命干部越来越体会到，要搞好春耕生产，必须活学活用毛主席著作，加强贫下中农革命派和革命干部的大联合、大团结。要实现这一点，其中的关键问题是干部。因为干部在春耕生产中负有重大责任，而在干部中又存在着各种各样的活思想，这些问题不解决，就会影响生产和工作。徐行公社针对这一情况，在最近召开的有公社、生产大队、生产队三级干部和贫下中农代表参加的会议上，组织大家带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，举行了讲用会。革命干部和革命群众互相亮思想，摆观点，谈认识，达到了相互交心，统一认识，提高觉悟的目的，从而使革命干部和贫下中农革命派在毛泽东思想的基础上进一步团结起来，同心协力，抓好革命，促好生产。
    下面是这次讲用会上部分干部和社员的发言摘要。
    对干部要作阶级分析，区别对待
    贫下中农代表李爱林说：
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”毛主席的教导，应该成为我们看待和处理干部和群众关系的准则。
    最近，党中央给我们写了信，号召我们要“认真地抓革命，促生产，动员一切力量，立即为做好春耕生产而积极工作。”我们广大贫下中农的积极性是很高的，我们一定要把革命抓好，把春耕搞好。至于干部，党中央在给我们的信里说得很清楚：“农村人民公社各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。”从我们公社的干部情况来看，也是这样。除掉党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以外，大部分是好的和比较好的，他们中有些同志也犯过这样那样的错误，有过这样那样的缺点。但是这些都属于人民内部的矛盾，可以用“团结——批评——团结”的方针来解决。我们希望这些有缺点和错误的同志，能够挺起腰杆，努力工作，在春耕生产中，将功补过。只要你们愿意听取群众意见，承认错误，并且努力改正，我们贫下中农是信得过你们的，支持你们工作的。
    我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，最热爱毛主席，毛主席怎样说，我们就怎样做，不折不扣，不讲价钱。我们相信，只要我们大家都听毛主席的话，都按照毛主席的指示办事，我们就一定能够抓好革命，促好生产，完成毛主席和党中央交给我们的光荣任务，在春耕生产中打一个漂亮仗。
    不打退堂鼓，要当急先锋
    小庙大队队长卢万兴说：
    这次无产阶级文化大革命，对每一个人，每一个干部都是一场考验。开始我只想到革人家的命，没想到自己在思想上也要过社会主义这一关。我总认为自己是“四清”运动后新上台的干部，当队长的时间不长，又是年轻人，工作中没有犯过什么大错误，估计这次运动对我来说不会有多大问题。万万没有想到，运动一来，群众就给我贴了不少大字报，提出许多批评。我想，过去常听人说，干部没啥当头，果然是这样，我真有些想甩手不干了，还是当一个社员稳当，不会有啥风波。毛主席说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”我对照自己，就觉得脸红了。群众信任我，选我当干部，工作还没做几天，就想打退堂鼓，这对不起党和毛主席，对不起贫下中农。想到这里，我就进一步学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”毛主席的话好象就是对着我说的。从那以后，我对群众贴大字报不再反感了，认识到这是群众对我们干部的爱护和帮助，是为了使我们能更好地为人民服务。我应当在文化大革命中接受群众的批评和帮助。我改变了过去的不民主作风，虚心听取群众的意见，好的就采纳，不对的就解释，结果群众满意，工作也比过去做得好了。最近，党中央给我们农村广大贫下中农和各级干部的信，使我得到了很大的鼓舞。我一定要听毛主席的话，同群众一起抓革命，促生产，打响春耕第一炮，为进一步搞好文化大革命贡献力量。
        相信群众，相信党的政策
    小庙大队第七生产队队长季兆华说：
    我是在“四清”运动以后担任生产队长的，才干了八个多月。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我听到有人歪曲地说，这次运动是“罢官运动”，凡是当权派都要“揪”，还说什么“大干部大打倒，小干部小打倒”。当时我们这里的群众运动也起来得很快，很猛。在这种情况下，我是有点害怕，生产不敢大抓，连看到社员都有点怕，就怕下一步整到我的头上来。当时我给自己规定了一条：工作要做，话要少说，免得让别人抓到小辫子。
    过了一段时间，群众并没有给我贴多少大字报，我有点奇怪。冷静下来，学习了这次文化大革命的方针政策，才知道这次农村无产阶级文化大革命的重点是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子。这样我心里就亮堂多了，思想上的疙瘩解开了。再同贫下中农谈谈，才知道他们根本不是要把所有干部都打倒，这完全是那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派保护自己的手法，也是那些没有改造好的地富反坏右分子造的谣言。他们企图离间革命干部和群众的关系，破坏我们的无产阶级文化大革命。
    我过去工作中有没有缺点错误呢？当然是有的。毛主席教导我们说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”这次搞文化大革命，正是个好机会，让群众给我提意见，帮助我，把我思想上的毛病烧掉，以后工作可以做得更好。思想一开窍，就一通百通，啥个苦恼，啥个见不得人，统统丢开了。我也不怕这次文化大革命了，不怕群众给我贴大字报了，反而觉得这是群众对我的最大帮助和爱护。
    现在，党中央又给我们贫下中农和各级干部写了信，要我们抓革命，促生产，全力投入春耕。我一定听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，同贫下中农一起，挑起革命和生产两副重担，夺取革命、生产双丰收。由于我思想通了，眼睛亮了，做起活来劲头十足，社员同我也搭得来，我们队的革命和生产搞得很好。
    到群众里面去，站到革命人民一边
    平民大队党支部书记宣振东说：
    我在无产阶级文化大革命初期的一些想法，完全是违背毛主席的教导的。革命群众给我贴大字报，开会批判我在运动和工作中的错误，触动了我的灵魂，我就受不了啦。我一心只朝自己好的一面想：我是贫农出身，从小苦得要命，靠毛主席、共产党才翻了身，我怎么会不紧紧地跟着党走呢？反正，千错万错，就错在“当权”两个字上。我思忖：我用不着革命群众来夺权，我情愿“交权”。那段时间，我“出门气呼呼，回家穷光火”，思想上很苦闷。
    怎么办呢？总不能老这样下去啊！我常注意收听电台的广播，读报纸上的社论，因为这上头有毛主席的最新指示。
    毛主席说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”毛主席要我到群众里面去，我就听他老人家的话，到群众里面去。这一下，给了我很大教育。有的社员讲：毛主席在北京，眼睛看得非常清，你只要革命，心思笃定。有的社员讲：无产阶级文化大革命实在好，没有这场文化大革命，我们的国家就可能改变颜色。我听了就想：为什么社员群众对文化大革命这样欢迎，我自己却灰溜溜的呢？我带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。
    毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。”我还学了《湖南农民运动考察报告》。毛主席讲得清楚极了，我有这样那样的错误念头，归结到一点，就是自己立场还有问题。我没有完全站在革命人民一边，所以同样一个问题，看起来就两样，很多事情觉得刺眼睛。
    情绪不对头的时候，读起“老三篇”来很吃力，立场转变了再读，就比较好“消化”了。我是为人民服务的，有缺点、错误为啥不欢迎群众批评指出呢？这没有道理嘛。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”这次文化大革命冲一冲，就把我脑子里的龌龊思想冲出来了，一冲出来，就可以对准了消毒。贫下中农早就对我说过，我们不是要把你打成右派，是要把你打成左派。我越想越觉得这句话亲切，无产阶级文化大革命真是好得很。
    现在，毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，我一定跟广大贫下中农站在一起，大闹革命，大闹生产，在实际斗争中来改正自己的缺点、错误。
    放下包袱，轻装上阵
    徐行公社副社长戴仁林说：
    在前一个时期的无产阶级文化大革命中，我不自觉地执行了一条资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误。我的心情是很沉重的，决心认真地向革命群众检讨。可是，公社党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是怎么想的呢？他们为了保住自己的“乌纱帽”，把我们推到“第一线”，叫我们出面代表公社党委参加各单位召开的批判会，好让他们溜掉。他们这个阴谋，很快被革命群众戳穿了，造了他们的反。这件事给了我很大教育，革命群众是掌握党的政策和斗争大方向的，他们是通情达理的。不过，我脑子里闪出了另外一个念头，我也是当权派中的一个，过去有些事情我是参加研究的，当时没有顶住，现在起来揭发，那些家伙一定会说：“嘿，你那时候为啥不讲？放马后炮，讨革命群众的好，真是两面三刀。”还有，我也在考虑，万一这些人打不倒，将来怎么在一起工作呢？还是再看一看吧。
    在我举棋不定的时候，毛主席的宝书给我指明了方向。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”毛主席的话，使我想起了我的身世。我从小替资本家做工，受尽了压迫、剥削和欺负，是毛主席、共产党把我从火坑中救了出来，为了我们这些穷人的翻身解放，千千万万的革命烈士献出了自己宝贵的生命。今天，我们面临的无产阶级文化大革命，是关系到我们国家会不会改变颜色的一场你死我活的阶级斗争，在这紧要关头，我为什么有那么多个人利益不能丢掉呢？我一定要放下包袱，轻装上阵。
    经过思想斗争，我大胆地起来揭发问题，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开火。贫下中农和革命群众非常欢迎我这样做，大力支持我；可是，那一小撮心里有鬼的人，对我冷言冷语，讽刺挖苦。他们的意思是说，你自己也不干净，有人还要揪你，你倒有工夫来搞我们！小心轮到你自己！在这种压力面前，我又学习了毛主席的教导：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，……‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’……”我确实是有错误，我要向革命群众作检查；同时，正因为我过去犯了错误，我更要跟群众站在一起，搞好革命，做好工作，争取将功补过。我要按照林彪同志的指示去做，既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要不断地把自己作为革命的对象，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。
    当前，春耕大忙季节到了，我坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，敢于工作，敢于负责，把革命和生产的担子挑起来，为把我们徐行公社建设成为毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗！
