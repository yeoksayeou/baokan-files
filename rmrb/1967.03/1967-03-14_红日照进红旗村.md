The red sun shines on Hongqi Village,
Hongqi Village is filled with joy.
The villagers gather around Chairman Mao's portrait,
Listening to me read the letter from the Party Central Committee.

The old man listens intently,
He listens over and over, still not satisfied.
The auntie fears she might not hear clearly,
Hugging her baby, she moves closer.

I raise my voice and read loudly,
Holding the letter, my heart is boiling.
Each word and sentence is like spring thunder,
The thunderous voice brings good news.

From the crowd, a young man jumps out,
He throws off his cotton jacket and extends his hand:
"Comrade, let me see it again,
I'll work even harder with this in mind."

His words have barely fallen,
The girls eagerly express their resolve:
"We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's call,
To seize the revolution and promote production,
We will not stop until we achieve complete victory!"

This side writes a battle plan,
That side expresses their resolve,
But where is the team leader Li Aimin?
Suddenly, a whip cracks outside the door,
The team leader's voice echoes...

The red sun shines on Hongqi Village,
Hongqi Village is filled with joy.
Men, women, old, and young are all mobilized,
People and horses are lively, celebrating the spring plowing!

    红日照进红旗村
    唐伯藩红日照进红旗村，红旗村里喜盈盈，社员们围着毛主席像，听咱念党中央的信。老大爷听得多入神，听了几遍还不过瘾；大嫂子生怕听不清，抱着娃娃直往前挪近。我放开嗓门大声念，手捧信件心沸腾，一字一句如春雷呵，春雷声声传喜讯。人群里蹦出个棒小伙，棉袄一甩把手伸：“同志，让我再瞧瞧，干起活来更有劲。”他的话音刚刚落，姑娘们争先恐后表决心：“坚决响应毛主席的号召，抓革命，促生产，不获全胜不收兵！”这边下战书，那边表决心，却不见队长李爱民。忽听门外鞭声响，传来了队长的?喝声……红日照进红旗村，红旗村里喜盈盈，男女老少齐动员，人欢马叫闹春耕！
