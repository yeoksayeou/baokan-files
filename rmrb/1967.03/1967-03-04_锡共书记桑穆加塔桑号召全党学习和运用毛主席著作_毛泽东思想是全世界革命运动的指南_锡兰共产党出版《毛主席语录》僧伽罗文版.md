The Sri Lankan Communist Party Secretary Sanmugathasan calls for the entire party to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for the revolutionary movement of the entire world. The Sri Lankan Communist Party publishes the Sinhala version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

	NEW DELHI, March 3 — The long-awaited treasure, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," in the Sinhala language, was published in Colombo on March 2 by the Sri Lankan Communist Party.

	This red-covered treasure features a portrait of Chairman Mao.

	Sri Lankan Communist Party Politburo member and Secretary Sanmugathasan, speaking on the publication of this book, said, "The publication of the Sinhala version of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is of historical significance for the progressive movement and the workers' movement in Sri Lanka. Mao Zedong Thought is the concentrated expression of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the Marxism-Leninism of the era when world imperialism is approaching its doom and world socialism is approaching its final victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the compass guiding the revolutionary movement of the entire world."

	He said, "At a time when the working class and the progressive movement in Sri Lanka are partially corrupted by modern revisionism, right-wing reformism, and the Trotskyite sectarianism of the left, we believe that only by studying, understanding, and applying Mao Zedong's teachings can we point out the path forward for our country's revolutionary movement."

	He said, "We call on all party members, our sympathizers, and all progressive individuals to repeatedly read, understand, and apply the teachings of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao Zedong."

    锡兰共产党出版《毛主席语录》僧伽罗文版
    新华社科伦坡三日电　锡兰人民久已渴望的宝书——《毛主席语录》僧伽罗文版，三月二日在科伦坡由锡兰共产党出版。
    这本红皮宝书，印有毛主席像。
    锡兰共产党政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑就这本书的出版发表谈话说，《毛主席语录》僧伽罗文版的出版，对锡兰的进步运动和工人运动具有历史意义。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的集中表现，是世界帝国主义接近灭亡、世界社会主义接近最后胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是指导全世界革命运动的指南针。
    他说：“当锡兰工人阶级和进步运动部分地遭到现代修正主义、右翼改良主义和左的宗派主义的托洛茨基主义的腐蚀的时候，我们认为只有学习、领会和运用毛泽东的学说，才能够指出我国革命运动前进的道路。”
    他说：“我们号召我们党全体党员、我们的同情者以及一切进步人士反复阅读、领会和运用当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的学说。”
