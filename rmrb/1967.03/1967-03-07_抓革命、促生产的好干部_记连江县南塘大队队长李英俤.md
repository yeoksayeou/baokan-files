Li Yingzhi, the head of Nantang Brigade in Aojiang Commune, Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, and a member of the Communist Party, has been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Together with the masses, he has been seizing the revolution and promoting production, striving for victories in both revolution and production.

In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Li Yingzhi paid close attention to studying the “Sixteen Points.” He was determined to lead the movement and mobilize the masses. After the draft directive from the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the rural Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was issued, he convened an expanded meeting that included militia members and Young Communist League members. At the meeting, he said, “This Cultural Revolution is personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. It is extremely wise. We must resolutely overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. We poor and lower-middle peasants must immediately form revolutionary organizations and resolutely rise up to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. I am one of the brigade leaders. If I have any shortcomings or mistakes, I hope everyone will boldly expose and criticize them. Every cadre must undergo this great democratic test. We must not retaliate and must not label revolutionary masses as counter-revolutionaries. You should direct your ‘cannons’ at me.” Li Yingzhi acted on his words. The next day, he went to buy bamboo and wooden boards and, together with the brigade party secretary, made many columns for posting big-character posters.

The masses were mobilized, and organizations like the Red Guards were established. At that time, some people, influenced by the erroneous idea of rejecting and overthrowing everything, began to direct the spearhead of struggle at Li Yingzhi, holding meeting after meeting to expose and criticize his problems.

At this time, there was much discussion among the masses and cadres. However, Li Yingzhi resolutely took the initiative to draw fire upon himself. For criticisms that were correct, he humbly accepted them and examined himself; for those that were incorrect, he patiently listened and then patiently explained. Some people saw Li Yingzhi actively mobilizing the masses to seize the revolution and promote production, yet still being criticized, and said, “Brother Yingzhi, are you not feeling wronged by doing this?”

Li Yingzhi replied, “This Cultural Revolution is the wisest. It has exposed many time bombs. As long as our country does not change color, what does it matter if I receive some criticism? Besides, I do have shortcomings and mistakes. The masses’ criticism is completely correct.”

Someone said, “Old Li, why are you not troubled or afraid when the masses criticize and struggle against you?”

Yingzhi said, “Chairman Mao teaches us: ‘We Communists should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses’ struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses’ struggle.’ I myself draw fire upon myself, hoping to burn away the filth in my mind. What is there to be afraid of?”

A production team leader said to him, “Yingzhi, the masses criticize and struggle against you, yet you still lead production. If it were me, I would have lain down and refused to do anything.”

Yingzhi said, “Seizing the revolution and promoting production is Chairman Mao’s great call. We cadres must not lie down and refuse to do anything! There is so much to do: fertilizing, repairing water conservancy projects, afforestation, and field management. If production is not done well, who will suffer the loss? It will be the more than 1,200 members of Nantang who will suffer, and it will be the country that will suffer! If I do not seize production, make amends for my mistakes, how can I face the Party, Chairman Mao, and the masses!”

Some relatives and friends also advised him, “Year after year you are criticized. It’s better not to be a power-holder!”

Yingzhi said, “I come from a poor peasant family. Before liberation, I suffered endless oppression, worked as a hired laborer, and was treated like a cow and horse, eating and dressing poorly. My sister was sold to someone else as a child bride. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that saved me and turned my family’s fortunes around. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao’s words, correct my mistakes, and better seize the revolution and promote production.”

When his wife complained, he educated her, saying, “The Cultural Revolution is extremely important. If our country becomes revisionist, then it will be a matter of life and death!” With his help, his wife took the initiative to handle household chores, allowing him to better participate in the movement.

A bad element saw Li Yingzhi being criticized and clapped his hands in delight, stirring up trouble behind his back. The poor and lower-middle peasants told Li Yingzhi, “Someone is stirring up trouble behind your back and causing disruption.”

Li Yingzhi said, “The more those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists oppose me, the happier I am!”

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Nantang Brigade was carried out vigorously. Li Yingzhi was not concerned about himself but was concerned about the broad masses, the revolutionary interests, and the use of the masses’ surging enthusiasm in the Cultural Revolution for production. After the People’s Daily published the editorial “Seize the Revolution and Promote Production, Fire the First Shot of Spring Production,” he immediately found the poor and lower-middle peasants and asked them to copy it for propaganda to the masses. He told the young revolutionaries, “Your daring spirit is very good. In the future, you must study hard, follow Chairman Mao’s words, act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, and act according to policy. You must unite, oppose sectarianism, and oppose small-groupism.” He also taught and encouraged the youth to actively study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, to break private interests and establish public interests in the Cultural Revolution, to touch the depths of the soul, to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and to cultivate themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. He often explained policies to the masses at criticism meetings and propagated the importance of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

Whether it was exposing and criticizing his own problems or exposing and criticizing others’ problems, after each meeting, he would seize the time to seriously arrange production with the community members and cadres; the next day, he would take the lead in participating in labor, actively leading everyone to work, and blending in with the community members. Under Li Yingzhi’s active leadership, the revolution in Nantang Brigade was carried out well, and production was also excellent, plowing all the land in the entire brigade. By February 20, they had already accumulated 11,500 loads of fertilizer, planted more than 700 acres of pine, fir, and tea oil, and mobilized more than 6,000 workers for water conservancy projects; they also promptly carried out mid-season cultivation and fertilization for vetch and wheat fields, ensuring their vigorous growth.

Because Li Yingzhi stood out, put politics in command, went among the masses, the local revolutionary masses all praised him for withstanding the test.

    抓革命、促生产的好干部
    ——记连江县南塘大队队长李英俤
    福建省连江县敖江公社南塘大队队长、共产党员李英俤，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，同群众一道抓革命、促生产，力争革命、生产双胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期，李英俤就很注意学习十六条，决心站在运动前面，发动群众。中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）公布之后，他就召开了包括民兵、共青团员参加的扩大会，他在会上说：“这次文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的，非常英明。我们要坚决斗倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫牛鬼蛇神。我们贫下中农要马上成立革命组织，坚决起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。我是大队领导人之一，有缺点，有错误，希望大家大胆揭发批判，每个干部都要经受这次大民主的考验，决不能打击报复，决不能把革命群众打成反革命。你们要把‘炮口’对准我。”李英俤说干就干，第二天就去买毛竹和木板，同大队党支书一道做了许多贴大字报的栏。
    群众发动起来了，成立了红卫兵等组织。当时，有些人受到排斥一切、打倒一切的错误思想的影响，开始把斗争矛头指向李英俤，一次又一次地开会揭发和批判李英俤的问题。
    这时，群众和干部中议论纷纷。李英俤却坚决引火烧身，群众提出的批评，对的，他就虚心地接受，检查自己；不对的，也耐心听取，然后耐心解释清楚。有的人见到李英俤积极发动群众抓革命，促生产，又受批判，说：“英俤哥，这样搞，你不受委屈吗？”
    李英俤回答说：“这次文化大革命是最英明的，挖出来许多定时炸弹。只要我们国家永不变色，我受点批判有什么关系呢？况且我也有缺点，有错误，群众的批判是完全正确的。”
    有人说：“老李，为什么群众对你批评斗争你还不苦恼、不害怕？”
    英俤说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。’我自己引火烧身，希望能烧掉自己头脑中的脏东西，有什么可怕的呢？”
    有个生产队长对他说：“英俤，群众对你批评斗争，你还带头领导生产；要是我，早躺倒不干了。”
    英俤说：“抓革命，促生产，是毛主席的伟大号召，我们当干部的绝不能躺倒不干！积肥、修水利、造林、搞田间管理，事情这么多，搞不好生产谁受损失？是南塘一千二百多名社员受损失，是国家受损失！我不抓生产，将功补过，怎对得起党，对得起毛主席，对得起群众！”
    一些亲戚朋友也劝他说：“年年受批评，快不要做什么当权派了！”
    英俤说：“我出身贫农，解放前受尽压迫，当短工，做牛做马吃不饱，穿不暖，妹妹卖给人家做童养媳。是毛主席、共产党救了我，使我全家翻了身，我一定听毛主席的话，有错就改，要更好地抓革命，促生产。”
    当他的妻子埋怨他的时候，他就教育她说：“文化大革命是非常重要的。如果我们国家变成修正主义，那么就是人头落地的事啊！”他妻子在他的帮助下，主动地担负起了家务活，让他更好地参加运动。
    有个坏分子看到李英俤受批评，在一旁拍手称快，背后进行煽动。贫下中农告诉李英俤说：“有人在你背后煽动，破坏。”
    李英俤说：“那些地、富、反、坏、右分子越反对我，我越高兴呐！”
    南塘大队文化大革命轰轰烈烈地展开了。李英俤关心的不是自己，而是关心广大群众，关心革命利益，关心把群众在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲，用到生产上去。《人民日报》发表了《抓革命，促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮》的社论后，他马上找贫下中农，要他们抄出向群众宣传。他对那些年青的革命派说：“你们的敢闯精神很好。你们以后更要好好学习，听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事，照政策办事，要大联合，要反对宗派主义和小团体主义。”他还教导和勉励青年们要活学活用毛主席著作，在文化大革命中，破私立公，触及灵魂深处，彻底铲除修正主义根子，把自己培养成可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。他还常在批判会上向群众解释政策，宣传抓革命、促生产的重要性。
    不论是揭发批判他本人的问题，或者是揭发批判别人的问题，每当开完会，他都要抓紧时间，认真向社员和干部布置生产；第二天，又带头参加劳动，积极带领大家出工，和社员打成一片。在李英俤的积极带动下，南塘大队革命搞得很好，生产也搞得很出色，把全大队的土地都犁完了。到二月二十日止，他们已经积精肥一万一千五百担，营造马尾松、杉木、油茶七百多亩，修水利出动六千多工；对紫云英、麦田，也都抓紧进行中耕管理、追肥，保证它们茁壮生长。
    由于李英俤挺身而出，政治挂帅，到群众中去，当地革命群众都赞扬他经得起考验。
