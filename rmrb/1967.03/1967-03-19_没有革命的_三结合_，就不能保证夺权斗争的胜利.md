Without the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," victory in the struggle for power cannot be guaranteed.

The struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary forces in the Harbin Boiler Factory has undergone a tortuous process. Their experience once again demonstrates that to complete the task of the struggle for power, the proletarian revolutionary forces must adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings and establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ as the core leadership of the great unity. As the experience of this factory indicates, without such a leadership core, there cannot be a true great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, it is impossible to form a powerful revolutionary army with centralized leadership and unified command, it is impossible to smoothly carry out the struggle for power, and even if power is seized, it cannot be consolidated, and true power cannot be held.

Their experience also shows that the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ must firmly, consistently, and unconditionally implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the Party's policies. This is the fundamental guarantee for the proletarian revolutionary forces to seize, hold, and use power well, and it is the fundamental guarantee for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The experience of the Harbin Boiler Factory is worth learning from and studying.

Thunder roars, and victory songs echo. Under the guidance of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the entire Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Boiler Factory and the broad revolutionary masses have achieved the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Finally, we have seized the power from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We have truly seized power, held power, and become the masters of the boiler factory.

Our struggle for power has gone through three twists and turns, undergoing a process of gradual improvement from individual action to unity and then to the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

We deeply feel that to successfully complete this great historical task of seizing power, we must resolutely and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In a word, it is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the struggle for power. Summarizing our experience, it is clear that without the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," victory in the struggle for power cannot be guaranteed.

I

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution."

Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, in the storm of the "January Revolution," the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Harbin Boiler Factory surged forward like a tidal wave.

In this favorable situation, a countercurrent emerged. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the evil wind of counter-revolutionary economism blew. Issues of wages, benefits, bonuses, and the like arose. Some malicious elements took advantage of the chaos to loot and plunder. Various political forces took the stage. There was revolutionary rebellion, and there was counter-revolutionary "rebellion." Those who had been "cleansed" during the socialist education movement tried to reverse their cases. Landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists stirred. For a time, darkness spread, and evil winds blew.

We immediately recognized this as a sharp class struggle. The enemy attempted to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, undermine proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, and achieve their goal of a counter-revolutionary restoration.

The working class is the master of the state, and the Red Rebels are the true revolutionary forces armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Could we stand by and watch the situation deteriorate into chaos? No! No! Absolutely not! "Who will master the fate of the vast land?" We! We! We! On January 13th, our Red Rebel Corps took immediate action, seizing control of twelve key departments, including the finance, transportation, and security departments.

These twelve departments were the main focal points of various contradictions in the entire factory at that time. By seizing control of them, we essentially seized power. Although our power was not yet completely seized, we had at least controlled the main power. And we controlled it well! We suppressed the evil wind of counter-revolutionary economism and curbed the arrogance of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all ghosts and snakes.

At the beginning, we did not have a clear understanding of the great significance, characteristics, and laws of the struggle for power. Due to lack of experience, we underestimated many complex situations, and thus exposed many problems after seizing power. The main issue was acting alone without uniting with other revolutionary leftists. At that time, there were several revolutionary mass organizations in the entire factory. One organization seizing power led to a series of chain reactions: you seize, I seize; you seize this, I seize that; even to the point where several organizations simultaneously seized one unit. The result was: each acting on their own, command was lost, and the cultural revolution and production encountered many difficulties and chaos.

Some units seized power in form but could not actually control it. Some departments, due to not relying on internal leftist forces, seized power on the first day but lost it on the second day when the Red Rebel Corps comrades left.

The class enemies also took advantage of our weaknesses. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party secretly rejoiced, thinking they had found a lifeline. Some of their puppet "preservation" organizations also closely cooperated, confusing right and wrong, reversing black and white, spreading rumors, shooting dark arrows, and launching vicious attacks on the Red Rebel Corps; on the other hand, they desperately struggled, breaking into the Party Committee's door at night, stealing the Party Committee's seal, and performing various sham seizures and counter-seizures, attempting to protect the capitalist and revisionist old order.

Faced with this situation, we Red Rebels had only one belief: mobilize and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Defend proletarian dictatorship! To protect the factory, some Red Rebels sometimes went a day and a night without eating or sleeping.

The first seizure of power was the initial stage of the struggle for power, the prelude to the true seizure of power.

"Learning from failure." This struggle for power practice taught us: the proletarian revolutionary forces must seize power, the key is great unity and great solidarity, to "unite our true friends and attack our true enemies." Without great unity and solidarity, seizing power is just an empty slogan.

II

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of thousands of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution."

A spring thunder suddenly roared, and the masses sang loudly for the red sun. On January 22nd, the People's Daily published an editorial: "The proletarian revolutionary forces unite, seize power from the capitalist-roaders!" This is the great directive issued by our great leader Chairman Mao. We immediately analyzed the political situation of several mass organizations in the entire factory, determining which were revolutionary and should be united, and which were "preservation" organizations and should not be united. In this way, we connected with three revolutionary rebel organizations within the factory. On January 25th, we established the United Headquarters of the Red Rebels of the Harbin Boiler Factory and carried out the second seizure of power, seizing control of all the Party, government, finance, and cultural powers in the entire factory, reversing the fragmented situation in the factory.

The four revolutionary organizations participating in the United Headquarters had a total of more than 3,000 members, accounting for more than half of the factory's workforce.

In this situation of victory in the struggle for power, the "preservation" organizations quickly collapsed, and the factory once again saw a new revolutionary high tide.

However, this unity was not yet the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Some revolutionary organizations, due to localism, were unwilling to elect the true representatives of the revolutionary masses who had emerged during the movement to the United Headquarters. The leadership core of the United Headquarters was not sound, lacking revolutionary cadres, and could not form a true proletarian revolutionary authority. Although the United Headquarters seized the factory's power, it did not actually hold it. Many tasks could not be carried out, and unified leadership could not be formed. The situation of each acting on their own reappeared. As a result, the revolution was not well carried out, and production was not promoted.

The enemy would not readily accept their defeat. We "must not be too naive, simplifying the complex class struggle." A handful of political thieves who infiltrated our United Headquarters, seeing an opportunity, publicly raised the banner of "rebellion," but secretly colluded with a handful of capitalist-roaders, recruiting soldiers and expanding their forces, even pulling in the leaders of the counter-revolutionary organization "Honor Restoration Army," while seizing on some trivial issues and shortcomings in the work of the Red Rebels, spreading and viciously attacking, sowing discord and stirring up trouble among the revolutionary forces, planning and executing a counter-seizure step by step. This was their planned and step-by-step counter-seizure.

This struggle for power practice gave us another profound lesson: the proletarian revolutionary forces must seize power, merely uniting is not enough, and must, as Chairman Mao teaches, implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Without the great unity centered on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," there cannot be a true great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, it is impossible to form a powerful proletarian revolutionary army with centralized leadership and unified command, it is impossible to smoothly carry out the struggle for power, it is impossible to truly hold power, and even if power is seized, it cannot be consolidated.

III

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party."

Just as the revolutionary ship encountered thick fog and suddenly saw a million rays of light. The third issue of the Red Flag magazine published the editorial "On the Struggle for Power by the Proletarian Revolutionary Forces." Following this, the People's Daily also published a series of editorials on the victory and experience of the "three-in-one combination" seizure of power in Heilongjiang Province, pointing out that only the "three-in-one combination" can achieve victory in the struggle for power.

At this critical moment in the struggle for power, our great helmsman Chairman Mao once again pointed out the correct direction. Chairman Mao! You are our most brilliant helmsman. With you guiding the direction, our revolutionary ship will definitely be able to overcome storms and reefs, navigate past dangers, and advance to victory.

We followed the direction guided by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, quickly formed a "three-in-one combination" proletarian revolutionary army through connections and brewing, creating conditions for the complete victory of the struggle for power. We first launched a sudden and fierce attack on the class enemies, striking hard at a few ringleaders who had colluded with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and plotted a counter-seizure. The entire factory saw a great revolutionary situation.

The time for the third seizure of power had ripened. On February 10th, more than 5,000 proletarian revolutionary forces in the entire factory held a grand seizure of power rally, solemnly declaring: the new "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Revolutionary Committee of the Red Rebels of the Harbin Boiler Factory—was born! The Red Rebels joyfully celebrated the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, celebrating the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

The leadership of the Revolutionary Committee was established according to the principle of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." It included excellent representatives of workers, revolutionary cadres including leading cadres and technical personnel, and militia representatives, among others. Many members were revolutionary pioneers who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and were most supported by the masses, the leaders and true representatives of revolutionary mass organizations. They could represent the interests of the revolutionary masses, had a relatively high political consciousness, could consider the overall situation, and could implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

As soon as the "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee was born, it immediately showed its strong vitality. The Revolutionary Committee truly became the revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the entire factory. The proletarian revolutionary forces truly united. The masses had unshakable trust in the Revolutionary Committee, speaking to the Revolutionary Committee and consulting with the Revolutionary Committee on matters.

"Tigers crouch and dragons coil, today's victory surpasses the past, the world is upside down, and the situation is stirring." Once the proletarian revolutionary forces grasped the fate of the revolution and production, they released boundless energy and could create miracles on earth. Just ten days after seizing power, the entire factory exceeded the total production value plan. The small month did the work of a big month, and the actual completed total production value increased by more than twofold compared to January. The Red Rebels of the seventh workshop united the broad masses, and in the nine days after seizing power, completed 70% of the monthly production task, made up for the losses before seizing power, and exceeded the monthly production task. The Red Rebels of the sixteenth workshop led the broad masses, carried forward the spirit of communism, assisted the external workshop in rushing to produce chain wheels, and completed in one day the work of seven days, creating a record unmatched in the ten years since the start of operations.

IV

The practice of the struggle for power proves that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon guiding us to victory in the struggle for power.

Throughout the entire struggle for power, we Red Rebels have always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, combining the universal truth of Mao Zedong Thought with the reality of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our enterprise, and combining the transformation of the objective world with the transformation of the subjective world.

We deeply feel that in the struggle for power, to well implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must resolutely overcome various non-proletarian erroneous thoughts within the proletarian revolutionary forces. These erroneous thoughts, ultimately, are all about the character "self," manifested as: localism, sectarianism, individualism, non-organizational views, etc. We believe that only by carrying out two struggles for power simultaneously: seizing power from the capitalist-roaders and seizing the power of the character "self" in our minds, can we guarantee the thorough victory of the struggle for power, and can we hold and use power well after seizing it.

We deeply feel that the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is the political and organizational guarantee for the victory of the proletarian revolutionary forces in the struggle for power.

The "three-in-one combination" is a revolutionary "three-in-one combination," a "three-in-one combination" formed in revolutionary struggles, a "three-in-one combination" under the guidance of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, a "three-in-one combination" implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a "three-in-one combination" opposing the bourgeois reactionary line, and a "three-in-one combination" carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The "three-in-one combination" is not eclecticism, not conciliationism, not the merging of two into one. The "three-in-one combination" must fully play the role of revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary cadres. Only in this way can it be revolutionary. Only in this way can it be representative. Only in this way can it possess proletarian authority, implement strong centralized leadership on the broadest democratic basis, unite revolution and production, implement strong dictatorship over class enemies, and complete the battle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

To correctly implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," an important issue is to correctly handle cadres. For those in power, a class analysis must be conducted, distinguishing between proletarian cadres in power and bourgeois cadres in power; whether they stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. For those who stand on Chairman Mao's side, we must regard them as the Party's precious assets, protect them, and warmly welcome them to fight side by side with us. For cadres who have made mistakes, they should be given the opportunity to reflect on and correct their mistakes. As long as they reflect on and correct their mistakes, standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they can still take on appropriate leadership roles. Even for cadres with serious mistakes, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, they should be given the opportunity to reform and encouraged to redeem themselves. That kind of attitude towards cadres, not distinguishing right from wrong, disliking and not believing anyone with a "leader" title, and making them all stand aside, is completely wrong. In the process of brewing the establishment of the "three-in-one combination" leadership team, we encountered great ideological resistance in this regard. For example, a former deputy secretary of the factory Party Committee and head of the political department, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line in the previous movement, made some mistakes. However, after he realized this, he reflected on his mistakes and firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We advocated including him in the leadership core of the Revolutionary Committee. However, as soon as the list was proposed, it was opposed by many comrades, fearing that including him would bring in "preservationists" and "rightists." Some even said, "The province and city can have a 'three-in-one combination,' but the factory does not necessarily need one," and so on. We addressed these thoughts by organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant sayings on cadre policy and conducting a comprehensive class analysis of his situation. In the end, the majority of the masses agreed to include him. Regarding cadre issues, we believe that on the one hand, we must oppose the erroneous thought of overthrowing and excluding everything; on the other hand, we must also oppose the attitude of "three-in-one combination" for the sake of "three-in-one combination," not conducting class analysis, and forcibly pulling those who have not yet fully recognized and reflected on their mistakes, have not yet drawn a clear line with the capitalist-roaders in power, and have not yet drawn a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line into the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ.

Currently, all proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary cadres in our entire factory are studying the editorials "Correctly Handling Cadres" and "On the Revolutionary 'Three-in-One Combination'" from the Red Flag magazine, further improving and expanding the "three-in-one combination" teams at all levels. For revolutionary cadres and those who have made mistakes but still seek revolution, we distinguish different situations and adopt different combination methods. Some are absorbed into the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership team to play a core and backbone role. Others are arranged in the temporary power organ, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee and the supervision of the revolutionary masses, to do appropriate work. We feel that this approach is very beneficial for uniting revolutionary cadres and playing the role of revolutionary cadres. At the same time, we also learn from the experiences of Guiyang and Qingdao, conducting revolutionary great unity by department, forming unified revolutionary organizations to better mobilize the broad masses and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Chairman Mao said: "The responsibility of correctly recognizing and transforming the world has historically fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party." We Red Rebels are not only good at destroying an old world but also good at building a new world. We are determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line guided by Chairman Mao, and turn the Harbin Boiler Factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    没有革命的“三结合”，就不能保证夺权斗争的胜利
    哈尔滨锅炉厂红色造反团
    编者按：哈尔滨锅炉厂无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，经历了一个曲折的过程。他们的经验再一次说明：无产阶级革命派要完成夺权斗争的任务，必须遵照毛主席的教导，实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，并建立革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”的临时权力机构，作为大联合的领导核心。
    正如这个工厂的经验所指出的，没有这种领导核心，就不可能有无产阶级革命派的真正的大联合，就不可能组成一支有集中领导、有统一指挥的强大的革命大军，就不可能顺利地进行夺权斗争，即使夺了权也不可能巩固，不可能真正掌好权。
    他们的经验还说明：革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，必须坚定不移地、贯彻始终地、不折不扣地执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，执行党的方针政策。这是无产阶级革命派夺好权、掌好权、用好权的根本保证，是无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的根本保证。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂的经验，值得我们学习和研究。
    春雷滚滚，凯歌阵阵。我们哈尔滨锅炉厂红色造反团全体战士和广大革命群众，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合，实现了革命的“三结合”，终于从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中，把大权夺过来了。我们真正地夺了权，掌了权，当了锅炉厂的主人。
    我们的夺权斗争经过了三次反复和曲折，经过了一个从单干到联合再到革命的“三结合”的逐步提高的过程。
    我们深深地体会到，要胜利地完成夺权这个伟大的历史任务，一定要不折不扣地坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。一句话，就是用毛泽东思想指导夺权斗争。总结我们的经验，就是没有革命的“三结合”，就不能保证夺权斗争的胜利。
                           一
    毛主席教导我们说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在“一月革命”的风暴中，我们哈尔滨锅炉厂无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，以排山倒海之势迅猛地向前发展。
    在一片大好形势中，出现了一股逆流。由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑动，反革命经济主义的歪风刮起来了。什么工资、福利、奖金等等都来了。一些别有用心的分子混水摸鱼，趁火打劫。各种政治势力纷纷登台表演。有革命的造反，也有反革命的“造反”。在社会主义教育运动中被“刷”下来的“四不清”干部，纷纷妄图翻案。地、富、反、坏、右分子蠢蠢欲动。一时黑雾迷漫，阴风四起。
    我们一眼就识破这是一场尖锐的阶级斗争，敌人妄图扼杀无产阶级文化大革命，瓦解无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，以达到变天的目的。
    工人阶级是国家的主人，红色造反者是毛泽东思想武装起来的真正的革命派。我们能看着局面这样混乱下去不管吗？不能！不能！绝不能！“问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们！我们！我们！一月十三日，我们红色造反团采取了紧急行动，把工厂财务科、运输科、保卫科等十二个重要部门管起来了。
    这十二个部门是当时全厂各种矛盾的主要焦点。我们管起来，实质就是夺权。我们这个权虽然夺得还不彻底，还仅仅是把主要权力控制起来，可是控制得好！把反革命的经济主义的歪风煞住了，把地、富、反、坏、右和一切牛鬼蛇神的嚣张气焰打下去了。
    一开始，我们对于夺权斗争的伟大意义、特点和规律，并不是认识得很明确的。由于没有经验，对于很多复杂情况估计不足，因而夺权以后，暴露了许多问题。主要是单独行动，没有同其他革命左派联合起来。当时全厂有好几个革命的群众组织，我们一个组织夺了权，就引起了一系列的连锁反应：你夺我也夺；你夺这个，我夺那个；甚至出现一个单位由几个组织同时去夺的现象。结果是：各自为政，指挥失灵，给文化革命和生产造成了很多混乱和困难。
    有些单位形式上夺了权，实际上控制不起来。有的部门由于没有依靠内部左派力量，第一天把权夺了，第二天红色造反团的同志一走，权也就没有了。
    阶级敌人也钻了我们的空子。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派暗暗高兴，以为可以捞到什么救命稻草了。一些御用的“保”字号组织也紧密配合，他们一方面混淆黑白，颠倒是非，造谣言，放暗箭，对红色造反团大肆攻击；一方面狗急跳墙，半夜撬党委大门，偷党委大印，卑鄙地演出各种假夺权、反夺权的丑剧，妄图保护资本主义和修正主义的旧秩序。
    面临这种情况，我们红色造反者只有一个信念：动员起来，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！保卫无产阶级专政！为了保护工厂，有的红色造反者有时一天一夜不吃不睡。
    第一次夺权是夺权斗争的初级阶段，是真正夺权的前奏。
    “吃一堑长一智”。这次夺权斗争的实践教育了我们：无产阶级革命派要夺权，关键是大联合、大团结，要“团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”没有大联合，大团结，夺权只是一句空话。
                          二
    毛主席教导我们说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”
    一声春雷平地起，万众高歌红太阳。一月二十二日，《人民日报》发表社论：《无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！》这是我们伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的伟大指示。我们立刻对全厂几个群众组织的政治情况进行了分析，看看那些是革命的，应该联合，那些是“保”字号的，不应该联合。这样，我们串连了厂内的三个革命造反组织，一月二十五日，成立了哈尔滨锅炉厂红色造反者联合总部，进行了第二次夺权，把全厂的党、政、财、文大权都管了起来，全厂四分五裂的局面扭过来了。
    参加联合总部的四个革命组织的成员共三千多名，占全厂职工的半数以上。
    在这次夺权的胜利形势下，“保”字号组织迅速土崩瓦解，全厂又出现了新的革命高潮。
    但是，这次联合，还不能说是革命的“三结合”。有些革命组织因为有小团体主义，不愿把在运动中“杀”出来的革命群众的真正代表推选到联合总部。联合总部的领导核心不健全，没有革命的领导干部，不能形成真正的无产阶级革命权威。联合总部虽然把工厂大权夺过来了，但是，并没有把权真正地掌起来。有很多工作抓不起来，不能形成集中统一的领导。各自为政的局面又出现了。结果革命没有抓好，生产也没有促上去。
    敌人是不会甘心他们的失败的。我们“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”混进我们联合总部内的一小撮政治扒手，看到有机可乘，明里打着“造反”的旗号，暗里却和一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派相勾结，一面招兵买马，扩充势力，把反革命组织“荣复军”的头头也拉进来，一面抓住红色造反者的一些枝节问题和工作中的某些缺点，大肆宣扬和恶毒攻击，在革命派中间挑拨离间，拨弄是非，制造分裂。这是他们在有计划有步骤地进行反夺权。
    这次夺权斗争的实践，又给我们上了深刻的一课：无产阶级革命派要夺权，仅仅联合起来还不够，一定还要象毛主席教导的那样，实行革命的“三结合”。没有以革命的“三结合”为核心的大联合，就不可能有无产阶级革命派的真正的大联合，就不可能组成一支有集中领导、有统一指挥的强大的无产阶级革命大军，就不可能顺利地进行夺权斗争，就不可能真正掌权，即使夺了权也不可能巩固。
                            三
    毛主席教导我们说：“政策和策略是党的生命”。
    正当革命的航船遇到重重的迷雾，迎面闪出了万道的金光。《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》发表了。接着，《人民日报》又就黑龙江省“三结合”联合夺权的胜利和经验，连续发表社论，指出只有“三结合”，才能取得夺权斗争的胜利。
    在夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们伟大的舵手毛主席又一次指出了正确的航向。毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们最英明的舵手，有了您指引航向，我们革命的航船一定能够战胜惊涛骇浪，绕过险滩暗礁，胜利前进。
    我们按照伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向，通过串连和酝酿，很快组成了一支“三结合”的无产阶级革命大军，为夺权斗争的彻底胜利创造条件。我们首先迅雷不及掩耳地向阶级敌人发起了猛烈的攻击，狠狠地打击了与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派狼狈为奸、阴谋进行反夺权的少数首恶分子。全厂出现一派革命的大好形势。
    第三次夺权斗争的时机成熟了。二月十日，全厂无产阶级革命派举行了有五千多人参加的盛大的夺权大会，庄严宣告：新的“三结合”临时权力机构——哈尔滨锅炉厂红色造反者革命委员会诞生了！红色造反者纵情欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，欢呼以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利！
    革命委员会的领导班子，按照革命的“三结合”原则建立起来了。它既有工人的优秀的代表，也有革命的干部包括领导干部和技术人员的代表，也有民兵代表等等。其中许多成员都是在无产阶级文化大革命中“杀”出来的最受群众拥护的革命闯将，是革命群众组织的负责人和真正的代表。他们能代表革命群众利益，有比较高的政治觉悟，能顾全大局，能贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
      “三结合”的革命委员会一诞生，就立刻显示了它的强大的生命力。革命委员会真正成为全厂革命的，有代表性的，有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构，无产阶级革命派真正地联合起来了。群众无比信赖革命委员会，有话向革命委员会说，有事找革命委员会商量。
      “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”无产阶级革命派一旦掌握了革命和生产的命运，就焕发出无穷无尽的力量，就能创造出人间的奇迹。夺权后仅仅十几天，全厂就超额完成了总产值计划。小月干了大月的活，实际完成的总产值比一月份增长了两倍还多。七车间的红色造反者团结广大群众，在夺权后的九天里完成了全月生产任务的百分之七十，弥补了夺权前的损失，超额完成了全月的生产任务。十六车间的红色造反者带动广大群众，发扬共产主义精神，协助外车间赶作链轮，一天时间干了七天的活，创造了开工十年来从未有过的纪录。
                         四
    夺权斗争的实践证明，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是指导我们取得夺权斗争胜利的最强大的思想武器。
    在整个夺权斗争过程中，我们红色造反者一直坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想的普遍真理同本企业无产阶级文化大革命的实际结合起来，把改造客观世界同改造主观世界结合起来。
    我们深深地体会到，在夺权斗争中要很好地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，一定要狠狠地克服无产阶级革命派内部各种非无产阶级的错误思想。这些错误思想，归根到底就是一个“私”字，它的表现就是：小团体主义、本位主义、分散主义、个人主义、非组织观点，等等。我们认为，只有同时进行两个夺权斗争：夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，又夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，才能保证夺权斗争的彻底胜利，才能在夺权后，掌好权，用好权。
    我们深深地体会到，革命的“三结合”是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争取得胜利的政治保证和组织保证。
  “三结合”，是革命的“三结合”，是在革命斗争中形成的“三结合”，是在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下的“三结合”，是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三结合”，是反对资产阶级反动路线的“三结合”，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的“三结合”。“三结合”，不是折中主义，不是调和主义，不是合二而一。“三结合”必须充分发挥革命群众组织代表的作用，充分发挥革命干部的作用。只有这样，它才是革命的。只有这样，它才能有代表性。只有这样，它才能具有无产阶级权威，才能在最广泛的民主基础上实行强有力的集中领导，把革命和生产统一抓起来，才能对阶级敌人实行强有力的专政，才能胜利地完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    要正确地实行革命的“三结合”，一个重要问题是正确地对待干部。对当权派要作阶级分析，一定要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派；是站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边。对站在毛主席一边的革命干部，我们必须把他们当作党的宝贵财富，爱护他们，热情地欢迎他们同我们并肩战斗。对犯了错误的干部，应当给以检讨错误、改正错误的机会。只要他们作了检讨，改正了错误，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，仍然可以担任适当的领导工作。就是有很严重错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要给他们改过的机会，鼓励他们将功赎罪。那种对干部不分青红皂白，凡是带“长”字的，都不顺眼，都不相信，都一律靠边站，是十分错误的。在酝酿建立“三结合”的领导班子过程中，我们在这方面碰到的思想阻力很大。如有一个前厂党委副书记兼政治部主任，在前段运动中由于受资产阶级反动路线的影响，犯了一些错误。但是，当他认识以后，便检查了自己的错误，坚定地站到毛主席的革命路线一边来了，我们主张把他吸收到革命委员会的领导核心中来。但是名单一提出来，就遭到不少同志反对，怕结合进来是“保皇”，是“右倾”。还有的说：“省、市可以‘三结合’，工厂不一定”等等。我们针对这些思想，组织大家学习毛主席有关干部政策的语录，对他的情况进行了全面的阶级分析。最后，大多数群众都同意结合。对干部问题，我们认为，一方面要反对那种打倒一切、排斥一切的错误思想；另一方面，也要反对那种为“三结合”而“三结合”，不做阶级分析，把一些还没有充分认识和检讨错误、还没有同走资本主义道路当权派划清界限、还没有同资产阶级反动路线划清界限的人，硬拉到“三结合”的临时权力机构中来。
    目前，我们全厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，正在结合学习《红旗》杂志社论《必须正确地对待干部》和《论革命的“三结合”》，进一步健全和扩大各级“三结合”的班子。对革命的和犯了错误但还是要求革命的领导干部，区别不同情况，采取不同的结合方式。有的是吸收到革命的“三结合”的领导班子里来，让他们起核心作用和骨干作用。有的则安排在临时权力机构中，在革命委员会的领导和革命群众的监督下，做适当的工作。我们感到这样作，对于团结广大革命干部，发挥革命干部的作用，很有好处。与此同时，我们还学习贵阳和青岛的经验，按部门进行革命的大联合，组成统一的革命组织，以便更好地带动广大群众，胜利地完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席说：“正确地认识世界和改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。”我们红色造反者不但善于破坏一个旧世界，而且善于建设一个新世界。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进，把哈尔滨锅炉厂办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
