Peasants in Shandong's cotton-growing areas are implementing the directive to seize the revolution and promote production, actively making all kinds of preparations. They are determined to plant and cultivate cotton fields according to the state plan. In Quwo County, Shanxi, a struggle between two kinds of thoughts and two paths is being carried out, and the cotton planting plan is being strictly implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 27th: The cotton planting plan for Shandong Province's main cotton-growing areas has been fully implemented down to the production teams, and most production teams have already implemented it down to the plots. The cotton planting area that has been implemented exceeds the state plan. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-growing areas have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and are determined to plant and cultivate cotton fields according to the state plan, striving to produce more and better cotton for the state this year.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "seize the opportunity to grasp the links in production," the broad masses of peasants in the cotton-growing areas are now working with a spirit of "seizing the day" to hasten the various preparations for sowing cotton. In the fields, some peasants are hoeing and spreading fertilizer for the cotton fields; others are driving oxen to plow and harrow the cotton fields. In the villages, people are busy repairing sowing tools, selecting and treating cotton seeds. The cotton fields in the entire province have basically been plowed, and generally, after plowing, they have been harrowed two to three times. The preparation of cotton seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers is also relatively good. The cotton fields that have been implemented have relatively good irrigation conditions. This year, the cotton fields with irrigation conditions in the entire province account for more than 40% of the total cotton area, which is a significant increase compared to last year.

This year, Shandong's cotton planting plan is relatively large, and to ensure that it is fully and well implemented, the cotton-growing areas at the prefecture, county, and commune levels have established "three-in-one" leadership teams for cotton production. Many production teams have established specialized teams.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 27th: In Quwo County, Shanxi Province, known for its cotton production, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out a struggle between two kinds of thoughts and two paths, and strictly implementing this year's state-allocated cotton planting plan. The county plans to plant 186,000 mu of cotton this year, which has been implemented down to the production teams and plots by various people's communes. Now, various communes and production teams are hastening the preparations for sowing cotton before spring, striving to sow at high standards and high quality, and to achieve a bumper cotton harvest this year.

When the cotton planting plan for this year was initially formulated, some communes and production teams with more land and fewer laborers proposed to plant less cotton, citing the management of cotton as labor-intensive. Some communes and production teams with less arable land, on the other hand, emphasized grain production one-sidedly. Some landlords and rich peasants who had not been reformed incited, "Since we are practicing great democracy, let the commune members plant whatever they want!" Thus, the state's cotton planting plan for this year was affected. The frontline command department for seizing the revolution and promoting production in Quwo County promptly analyzed this situation, believing that whether to sow cotton according to the state plan is a reflection of the struggle between two kinds of thoughts and two paths in the current spring plowing and production. At the "seize the revolution, promote production" rally held in late February with the participation of more than 3,000 representatives from the county's four levels of cadres and revolutionary organizations, the frontline command department conducted ideological education on sowing cotton according to the plan for the participants, calling on the poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the county to regard the completion of the state's cotton planting plan as a serious political task. After the meeting, the frontline command departments at various levels repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's great instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and propagated the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." Various communes and production teams also, based on the active thoughts of cadres and commune members, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people and never forget this point." Actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works had an immediate effect. Ding Fuzhang, the deputy director of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association in Guanhuang Village, Dali Commune, said: "Whether or not to act according to the state plan is a big issue of whether or not to listen to Chairman Mao's words. We poor and lower-middle peasants must always think of the fact that our country has so many people and cannot just take care of ourselves without considering the state." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in Peinan Village, Xiapei Commune, with Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror, exposed the plot of class enemies inciting some people to reduce the cotton area and sabotage the state plan. Cadres and commune members unanimously expressed their determination to strictly follow the state plan and complete the cotton sowing task allocated. Thus, the county's cotton planting plan was smoothly implemented.

Now, the 186,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire county have all had their fertilizer prepared in full, with 75% of the fertilizer already applied to the fields; all cotton fields have been leveled and ridged, and after the rain, they have been harrowed and rolled to conserve moisture; cotton seeds have all been selected by grain; sowing tools and pesticides are ready, and more than 10 million jin of "warm ditch fertilizer" have been prepared for the cotton fields.

    山东棉区社员贯彻抓革命促生产指示积极作好各种准备
    决心按照国家计划种足种好棉田
    山西曲沃县开展两种思想、两条道路的斗争，不折不扣落实种棉计划
    新华社济南二十七日电　山东省主要产棉区的植棉计划已经全部落实到了生产队，大部分生产队已经落实到地块。全省落实的植棉面积，已超过国家计划。棉区广大贫下中农和革命干部响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，决心按国家计划种足种好棉田，争取今年为国家生产更多更好的棉花。
    遵照毛主席“不失时机地掌握生产环节”的教导，现在棉区广大社员正以“只争朝夕”的精神，加紧进行播种棉花的各项准备工作。田野上，有的社员在挥锨扬粪，为棉田施底肥；有的在扬鞭驱牛耕耙棉田。村庄里，人们正忙着检修播种工具，挑选和处理棉种。全省棉田已基本耕完，一般耕后都耙耢了二至三遍，棉种、农药和肥料的准备情况也比较好。已落实的棉田，灌溉条件也比较好。全省今年有灌溉条件的棉田占棉田总面积的百分之四十以上，比去年大有增加。
    今年，山东的植棉计划较大，为了种足、种好，棉区的专署、县、社都成立了“三结合”的领导棉花生产的班子，许多生产队建立了专业队。
    新华社太原二十七日电　在以产棉著名的山西省曲沃县，广大贫下中农和革命干部活学活用毛主席著作，开展两种思想、两条道路的斗争，不折不扣地落实了今年国家分配的种棉计划。全县今年计划种棉十八万六千亩，已经由各人民公社落实到生产队和落实到地块。现在，各社队正在加紧进行播种棉花前的准备工作，力争高标准、高质量地适时下种，夺取今年棉花丰收。
    在开始制订今年的种棉计划时，一些土地多、劳力少的社、队，有人借口棉花管理费工，提出要少种一点；而一些耕地较少的社队，又有人片面强调粮食生产。一些没有改造好的地主、富农煽动说：“实行大民主嘛，社员要种啥就种啥！”这样，国家今年分配的种棉计划就受到冲击。曲沃县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部及时地分析了这种情况，认为是否按照国家计划播种棉花，是两种思想、两条道路斗争在当前春耕生产中的反映。在二月下旬召开的有全县四级干部和革命组织代表三千多人参加的“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会上，第一线指挥部就对参加会议的人员进行了按计划种棉的思想教育，号召全县贫下中农把完成国家的种棉计划看成是一项严肃的政治任务。会后，各级第一线指挥部又向广大贫下中农反复宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大指示，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。各社队也针对干部和社员的活思想，普遍组织大家学习了毛主席的教导：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”活学活用毛主席著作收到了立竿见影的效果。大李公社观庄大队的贫协副主任丁福章说：“按不按国家计划办事，是听不听毛主席的话的大问题。我们贫下中农要经常想到我们国家有那么多人口，决不能只顾自己，不管国家。”下裴庄公社裴南庄大队的广大贫下中农和干部，以毛泽东思想作为照妖镜，揭露了阶级敌人煽动一些人缩小棉田面积，破坏国家计划的阴谋。干部和社员一致表示，要坚决服从国家计划，完成分配的棉花播种任务。这样，全县种棉计划就顺利地落实了。
    现在，曲沃全县十八万六千亩棉田的肥料已全部备足，百分之七十五的肥料已施到地里；所有棉田大都进行了平整切垫，雨后普遍进行了耙耱保墒；棉籽全部进行了粒选；播种农具和农药已准备就绪，还为棉田准备了一千多万斤“暖沟肥”。
