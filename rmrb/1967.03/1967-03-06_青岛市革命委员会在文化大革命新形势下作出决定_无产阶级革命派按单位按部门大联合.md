The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee, in response to the new situation of the Cultural Revolution, has issued a decision on the great alliance of revolutionary masses by unit and department. The full text of the decision, published on March 2, is as follows:

In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of Qingdao broke through the barriers set up by the bourgeois reactionary line and crossed the boundaries between units and departments to form revolutionary connections. They established many mass revolutionary organizations that spanned departments, units, and industries. This form of organization was necessary at the time. These organizations played an indelible role in the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, as well as in the struggle for seizing power.

Currently, the proletarian temporary power organ—the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee—has been established in our city. Below the municipal level, some systems and units have already established temporary power organs, while others are in the decisive stage of seizing power. Within a system or a unit, the revolutionary masses have common battle targets, common tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and common tasks of "grasp revolution, promote production." If the revolutionary masses retain the current organizational forms that span departments and industries, it will not only result in overlapping organizations and an increase in full-time personnel; more importantly, it will be detrimental to the completion of common tasks, may foster sectarianism and factionalism, and be detrimental to the ideological transformation of the revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses in our city have deeply felt this in the current movement and urgently demand a great alliance of revolutionary masses by unit and department. Therefore, it is decided:

1. Currently, the revolutionary masses in our city are vigorously carrying out rectification and study. Every member of the revolutionary mass organizations must seriously study Chairman Mao's works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and relevant editorials in the magazines "Red Flag" and "People's Daily." With the issue of the current organizational forms of revolutionary masses not being suitable for the battle tasks faced by the revolutionary masses, discussions and debates should be conducted. With Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, unify understanding, take immediate action, and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought in new organizational forms.

2. The headquarters (liaison headquarters) of city-wide revolutionary mass organizations should be immediately disbanded. Except for those participating in the work of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, all full-time personnel from the original headquarters should return to their original departments and units. They should work together with the revolutionary masses in these departments and units to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and to "grasp revolution, promote production," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

3. Revolutionary mass organizations in various industrial, administrative systems, or regions should unite and, together with revolutionary cadres, form corresponding "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs for the system or region. Once this temporary power organ is recognized by the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the branches (headquarters) of the revolutionary mass organizations in various systems and regions should be immediately disbanded. Except for those participating in the work of the corresponding system or regional temporary power organ, all full-time personnel from the original branches (headquarters) should return to their original units and work together with the revolutionary masses in these units to complete the new common battle tasks.

4. Revolutionary mass organizations in various grassroots units (factories, stations, shops, neighborhoods) should also unite and, together with revolutionary cadres, form "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs for the unit. This temporary power organ is both a temporary power organ and a joint headquarters for all revolutionary mass organizations. Once this temporary power organ is recognized by the higher-level temporary power organ, all organizations of revolutionary masses that span sections and workshops, such as brigades (headquarters, branches), should be disbanded. Except for the leadership of the temporary power organ, no full-time personnel from the revolutionary mass organizations should be retained.

5. The revolutionary masses throughout the city should warmly welcome the leaders and personnel of various revolutionary mass organizations who respond to the call of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee to return to their original units. Most of these comrades have been tested in the Cultural Revolution and have a certain influence among the masses. With the agreement of the masses, the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs at various levels can absorb some of them to participate in the various levels of temporary power organs. However, this should not increase the number of full-time personnel.

6. The leaders and personnel of various revolutionary mass organizations who return to their units should actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness and establish selflessness, and set an example in their posts, "grasp revolution, promote production," and forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

7. After the disbandment of the headquarters (branches, brigades) of various revolutionary mass organizations, all occupied buildings and public property should be returned to the original units and the corresponding "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs. Economic accounts must be carefully settled.

8. The "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs in various units have the right to handle, according to the regulations on violating labor discipline, those who arbitrarily leave their posts and wander outside. Those with serious offenses and who refuse to mend their ways should be severely dealt with after reporting to and obtaining approval from the higher-level "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ.

9. In the process of great alliance in new organizational forms, the revolutionary masses must guard against class enemies causing trouble. Those who spread rumors and slander, incite conflicts between revolutionary mass organizations, and disrupt the great alliance should be punished according to the severity of their offenses.

### 青岛市革命委员会在文化大革命新形势下作出决定  无产阶级革命派按单位按部门大联合

    青岛市革命委员会在文化大革命新形势下作出决定
    无产阶级革命派按单位按部门大联合
    新华社济南五日电　青岛市革命委员会三月二日公布了关于无产阶级革命派在新形势下按单位、按部门实行大联合的决定，全文如下：
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期，我市无产阶级革命派冲破资产阶级反动路线设置的层层障碍，打破单位之间、部门之间的界限，进行革命串连，并组成了许多跨部门、跨单位、跨行业的群众性革命组织。在当时，这种形式的联合是必要的。它们在前一段文化大革命中，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线作斗争中，以及夺权斗争中，立下了不朽的功勋。
    目前，我市已经建立无产阶级的临时权力机构——青岛市革命委员会。市以下各系统、各单位有些已经建立临时权力机构，有些则正处于夺权的决战阶段。在一个系统、一个单位中，无产阶级革命派有着共同的战斗目标，有着共同的斗、批、改的任务，有着共同的“抓革命，促生产”的任务。如果无产阶级革命派，在组织上仍保留现有的跨部门、跨行业的组织形式，不但机构重叠、脱产人员增多；更重要的是，不利于共同任务的完成，容易助长小团体主义、宗派主义，不利于无产阶级革命派成员的思想革命化。我市广大革命群众在当前的运动中，已深有所感，并迫切要求按单位、按部门实行无产阶级革命派大联合。为此，决定：
    一、目前，我市无产阶级革命派正在轰轰烈烈地开展整风学习，每一个无产阶级革命派组织的成员，都必须认真学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，以及《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》有关社论。带着无产阶级革命派面临的战斗任务和现有的无产阶级革命派的组织形式不相适应这个问题，进行讨论和辩论。以毛泽东思想为指针，统一认识，立即行动，在毛泽东思想的基础上，以新的组织形式联合起来。
    二、全市性的革命群众组织的各总部（联络总部）应立即撤销。原总部的脱产人员，除参加市革命委员会的工作人员外，全部回原所在部门、单位，和这些部门、单位的无产阶级革命派一起，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权和掌权，“抓革命，促生产”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    三、各企业、事业系统或地区性的革命群众组织，应联合起来，和革命干部一起组成相应的系统或地区的“三结合”的临时权力机构。这个临时权力机构一旦被市革命委员会承认，各系统、地区的革命群众组织的分部（总部）立即撤销，原分部（总部）的脱产人员，除参加各相应系统或地区的临时权力机构的工作人员外，全部回原所在单位，与这些单位的无产阶级革命派一起，完成新的共同的战斗任务。
    四、各基层单位（厂、站、商店、街道）的革命群众组织，也应联合起来，和革命干部一起组成本单位的“三结合”的临时权力机构。它既是临时权力机构，又是各革命群众组织的联合总部。这个临时权力机构一旦被上级临时权力机构承认，跨科室、跨车间的各革命群众组织的支队（总部、分部）等机构，一律撤销。除临时权力机构的领导成员外，不得再保留革命群众组织的脱产人员。
    五、全市无产阶级革命派，对响应市革命委员会号召返回原单位的各革命群众组织领导成员和工作人员，应热情欢迎，不得歧视。他们当中绝大部分同志在文化大革命中，是经受过考验的无产阶级革命派，在群众中有一定威信。各级“三结合”的临时权力机构在群众同意的情况下，可吸收他们中间的部分人员参加各级临时权力机构。但不能因此而增加脱产人员。
    六、回到各单位的各革命群众组织的领导成员和工作人员，要活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在各个岗位上起模范作用，“抓革命，促生产”，永葆革命青春。
    七、各革命群众组织的总部（分部、支队）撤销后，所占用的房屋和公有财物，一律交还原单位和相应的“三结合”的临时权力机构。经济帐目一定要认真清理了结。
    八、各单位的“三结合”的临时权力机构，有权对任意脱产、在外游荡人员，按照违犯劳动纪律规定处理；情节严重而又累教不改者，在报请上一级“三结合”的临时权力机构批准后，严肃处理。
    九、无产阶级革命派在新的组织形式的大联合过程中，要严防阶级敌人从中捣乱。如有造谣中伤，挑拨无产阶级革命派组织之间的关系，破坏大联合者，按情节轻重，依法惩处。
