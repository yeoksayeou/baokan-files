Under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a new stage: the proletarian revolutionary forces are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces is like a thousand rivers flowing into the sea, surging and powerful, demonstrating immense strength. Great unity is excellent!

The proletarian revolutionary forces must unite by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, trusting the masses, relying on the masses, adhering to principles, and adhering to unity. At the same time, they must correctly handle themselves.

To correctly handle oneself, one must first have a correct self-assessment. How should one assess oneself? One should use the method of "two-line struggle."

The general direction of the proletarian revolutionary forces is correct, and they have played a leading role in the movement. However, the proletarian revolutionary forces are not without shortcomings.

Our attitude should be: fully develop our strengths for the revolution; continuously struggle against our shortcomings to meet the needs of the revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself; one must combine the transformation of the objective world with the transformation of the subjective world. Only by continuously transforming the subjective world can one better transform the objective world.

Human history is a process of continuous "two-line struggle." The proletarian revolutionary forces are no exception; they also advance through the struggle of "two-line struggle." This is an objective fact. Whether or not to use the method of "two-line struggle" to view oneself is not only a methodological issue but also a worldview issue. Believing that everything about oneself is good, or believing that doing good deeds in a certain period is equivalent to having a lifetime guarantee, is a metaphysical worldview.

Correctly handling oneself, viewing oneself with "two-line struggle," means breaking with the old and establishing the new, criticizing the bourgeois worldview in one's mind and establishing the proletarian worldview, breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, thoroughly criticizing bourgeois ideology, and thoroughly establishing Mao Zedong Thought, achieving the revolutionization of thought. The great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces requires the revolutionization of the thought of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Using the method of "two-line struggle" to view oneself is very important.

The proletarian revolutionary forces have achieved great successes in the Cultural Revolution. However, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great successes, there is no reason for us to be arrogant and complacent. Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind. We must always remember this truth." If one does not view oneself with "two-line struggle," one will turn successes into burdens and become arrogant. The proletarian revolutionary forces must continuously achieve new successes and continuously do good for the people.

Only by viewing oneself with "two-line struggle" can one correctly handle the criticism and supervision of the masses and continuously improve one's work. "A house should be cleaned regularly; if not cleaned, it will accumulate dust; a face should be washed regularly; if not washed, it will also be covered with dust. Our comrades' thoughts and our Party's work will also accumulate dust and should be cleaned and washed." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and regularly do the work of cleaning and washing. We must have the courage to admit that our work and thoughts have accumulated dust, and when others help us clean and wash, we must welcome it. If one thinks that everything good is oneself and everything bad is others, then in the long run, one will fall hard and seriously hinder the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Only by viewing oneself with "two-line struggle" can one continuously absorb new nutrients in the struggle and grow more quickly. Chairman Mao said: "The enemy of learning is one's own satisfaction. To seriously learn something, one must start from not being satisfied with oneself. Toward oneself, 'learn insatiably,' toward others, 'teach tirelessly,' we should take this attitude." Only by viewing oneself with "two-line struggle" can one achieve "learn insatiably." After taking power, the revolutionary forces must especially be vigilant against arrogance and complacency, strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on the "use" of them, seriously learn from actual struggles, and learn from the masses. Otherwise, one will turn from advanced to backward, which is very dangerous.

In summary, only by continuously viewing oneself with "two-line struggle" can one truly master Chairman Mao's thoughts, shake off the dust on oneself, and truly unite the proletarian revolutionary forces.

In short, correctly handling oneself, as Comrade Lin Biao pointed out, is to regard oneself as a force for the revolution and at the same time continuously regard oneself as an object of the revolution.

Generally speaking, regarding oneself as a force for the revolution is relatively easy to achieve, but regarding oneself as an object of the revolution is difficult for some comrades. However, these two aspects must be unified.

We must not forget that we live in a class society, in a time of sharp and complex class struggle as we transition from capitalism to communism. The class enemies are always trying to find their agents within the revolutionary ranks, and bourgeois ideology and other various forms of exploiting class ideology are fiercely attacking the revolutionary ranks, eroding the revolutionary ranks. In this situation, if the revolutionary forces do not regard themselves as objects of the revolution, they do not understand the laws of class struggle and cannot carry the revolution to the end.

Regarding oneself as an object of the revolution means removing the "selfishness" from one's mind. "Selfishness" as the commander will inevitably lead to seeking fame, position, power, profit, and making a name for oneself, casting aside the interests of the Party and the people. Such a person dares to make what revolution? Even if they temporarily join the revolutionary ranks, in the great storms of the revolution, they will ultimately end up confused about right and wrong, unable to distinguish friend from foe, and may even be swayed by the enemy's threats and inducements, betraying the revolution and the people. "Selfishness" is the great enemy in our minds.

To break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, the most fundamental point is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for transforming the objective world and also the sharpest weapon for transforming the subjective world. Regarding oneself as an object of the revolution ultimately serves one purpose: to let Mao Zedong Thought take command and guide all of one's actions.

Regarding oneself as a force for the revolution and at the same time regarding oneself as an object of the revolution is the only correct attitude of a conscious proletarian fighter. "Revolutionizing others, 'dare' comes first; revolutionizing oneself, 'fear' comes first," this is not the attitude a revolutionary should have. If one does not revolutionize oneself, one cannot revolutionize others well.

Even the revolutionary forces with a correct general direction must regard themselves as objects of the revolution. From any aspect, this is what we must do. The revolutionary forces, under the correct general direction, also have shortcomings and errors. For example, currently in some revolutionary organizations, tendencies such as dispersionism, factionalism, individualism, and anarchism seriously hinder the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces. Moreover, the class enemies are using every means to exploit the shortcomings and errors of the revolutionary forces to spread poisonous winds and ignite evil fires, attempting to divide and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks. Therefore, the revolutionary forces must regard themselves as objects of the revolution, seriously revolutionize themselves, to develop and consolidate the revolutionary ranks, and to achieve and consolidate victory.

Regarding oneself as an object of the revolution is naturally a painful thing. This is a continuous and fierce struggle between public-mindedness and selfishness, between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought, in one's mind. However, true revolutionary forces deeply understand that revolutionizing oneself is not an extra burden but is to liberate oneself from the muddy waters of the old world. Therefore, true revolutionary forces, when revolutionizing themselves, will not fear pain or shame, will thoroughly criticize "selfishness," and will criticize it to the end.

The revolutionary forces must correctly handle themselves and must break through various limitations. One must jump out of one's own scope and not just see oneself. Seeing only oneself, seeing only one's own small group, is a limitation. Believing that one is from a certain mountain and only cares for that mountain, not caring for others, is also a limitation. All these limitations ultimately boil down to one "selfishness," which is the bourgeois worldview.

The bourgeois worldview and the proletarian worldview are incompatible. Using the proletarian worldview to handle oneself necessarily requires oneself to be public-minded, selfless, dedicated to the public, consider the big picture, understand the big picture, and always be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the people. Using the bourgeois worldview to handle oneself is to be selfish, self-righteous, arrogant, and believe that one is the best, demanding unreasonable requests to be satisfied. In short, using the bourgeois worldview to handle oneself is to let "selfishness" rule in one's mind, issuing orders. Now is the time to seize power from "selfishness."

In the fierce class struggle, correctly handling oneself is very important. We see that some people make mistakes or have a good start but cannot maintain their integrity, precisely because they do not let Mao Zedong Thought take command, do not believe in the masses, and cannot correctly handle themselves. We must learn the necessary lessons from these people.

The tasks undertaken by us proletarian revolutionary forces are glorious and arduous. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have great expectations for us, and the broad masses of the people have great expectations for us. We must not disappoint these expectations. In this great proletarian cultural revolution that touches people's souls, we proletarian revolutionary forces must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our actions, thoroughly criticize "selfishness," thoroughly establish "public-mindedness," continuously revolutionize, and continuously advance, carrying both the transformation of the objective world and the transformation of the subjective world. We must cleanse the non-proletarian thoughts in our ranks, making our ranks develop healthier and stronger, and under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite and combine, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    正确地对待自己
    毛泽东思想哲学社会科学部红卫兵联队
    在我们的伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下，我国无产阶级文化大革命正进入一个新的阶段：无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权。无产阶级革命派的大联合，犹如千川入海，汹涌澎湃，显示了无比的威力。大联合，好得很！
    无产阶级革命派为了联合起来，必须活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，信任群众，依靠群众，坚持原则，坚持团结，同时，也必须正确地对待自己。
    要正确地对待自己，首先要对自己有一个正确的估价。对自己应该怎么估价呢？应该一分为二。
    无产阶级革命派的大方向是正确的，在运动中起了冲锋陷阵的作用。但是，无产阶级革命派也不可能没有缺点。
    我们的态度应该是：对自己的长处要充分发挥，为革命尽力；对自己的缺点要不断地进行斗争，以适应革命的需要。革命，也得革自己的命，要把改造客观世界和改造主观世界结合起来，只有不断地改造主观世界，才能更好地改造客观世界。
    人类的历史是一个不断地一分为二的发展过程。我们无产阶级革命派也不例外，也是在一分为二的斗争过程中不断前进的。这是客观存在着的事实。是不是用一分为二的观点看待自己，这不仅是方法论问题，而且是世界观的问题。认为自己一切都好，或者认为在某个时期做了好事就等于打了一辈子的保票，这就是形而上学的世界观。
    正确地对待自己，对自己一分为二，就是要破旧立新，要批判自己头脑中的资产阶级世界观和树立无产阶级世界观，就是要破私立公，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，实现思想革命化。无产阶级革命派的大联合，要求无产阶级革命派的思想革命化。
    用一分为二的观点看待自己是很重要的。
    无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中是有很大的成绩的。但是，我们要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”如果对自己不是一分为二，就会把成绩当成包袱，从而骄傲起来。我们无产阶级革命派应当不断地做出新成绩，不断地为人民做好事。
    只有用一分为二的观点看待自己，才能正确地对待群众的批评和监督，才能不断地改进工作。“房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会沾染灰尘的，也应该打扫和洗涤。”我们必须牢牢地记住毛主席的教导，经常地做打扫和洗涤的工作。我们应当有勇气承认自己的工作和思想沾染了灰尘，当别人帮助我们打扫和洗涤时，我们应当表示欢迎。如果认为千好万好是自己好，千错万错是别人错，那么，发展下去，就会摔大跟头，就会严重地妨碍无产阶级革命派大联合。
    只有用一分为二的观点看待自己，才能在斗争中不断地吸取新的养料，使自己比较快地成熟起来。毛主席说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。对自己，‘学而不厌’，对人家，‘诲人不倦’，我们应取这种态度。”只有对自己一分为二，才能做到“学而不厌”。革命派在掌权以后，要特别警惕骄傲自满的情绪，要加强对毛主席著作的学习，在“用”字上狠下功夫，认真地向实际斗争学习，向群众学习，否则就会由先进转化为落后，是非常危险的。
    总之，只有不断地对自己一分为二，才能真正把毛主席的思想学到手，才能抖掉自己身上的灰尘，使无产阶级革命派真正联合起来。
    正确地对待自己，概括地说，就是象林彪同志所指示的那样，要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。
    一般说来，把自己当作革命的一份力量，这是比较容易做到的，要把自己当作革命的对象，这对于一些同志就感到有点困难了。但是，这两者必须统一起来。
    不能忘记，我们是生活在阶级社会里，是生活在由资本主义向共产主义过渡的阶级斗争尖锐复杂的时代。阶级敌人时时刻刻企图在革命队伍中寻找他们的代理人，资产阶级思想以及其他形形色色的剥削阶级的思想意识拚命地向革命队伍扑过来，侵蚀革命队伍的肌体。在这种情况下，革命派如果不把自己作为革命的对象，那就是不懂得阶级斗争的规律，就不可能把革命进行到底。
    把自己当作革命的对象，就是去掉自己头脑中的
  “私”字。“私”字挂帅必然要争名、争位、争权、争利、争出风头，把党和人民的利益抛于脑后。这样的人还敢革什么命？即使暂时参加革命派的行列，但是在革命的大风大浪中，他最后一定要走到是非不清，敌我不分的地步，甚至会被敌人的威胁利诱所屈服，背叛革命，背叛人民。“私”字是我们头脑里的大敌。
    要破私立公，最根本的一点就是要活学活用毛主席著作。毛泽东思想是改造客观世界的最锐利的武器，也是改造主观世界的最锐利的武器。把自己当作革命的对象，归根结蒂就是实现一个目的：用毛泽东思想挂帅，用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动。
    把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又把自己当作革命的对象，这是自觉的无产阶级战士对待自己的唯一正确的态度。“革别人的命，‘敢’字当头；革自己的命，‘怕’字当头”，这不是一个革命者应有的态度。不革自己的命，革别人的命也是革不好的。
    大方向一直正确的革命派还要把自己当作革命的对象吗？无论从哪方面说来，都要求我们这样作。革命派在大方向正确的前提下，也是有缺点和错误的，比如，目前在一些革命组织中出现的分散主义、小团体主义、个人主义、无政府主义等等错误倾向，就严重地妨碍无产阶级革命派的大联合，而且阶级敌人也千方百计地利用革命派的缺点和错误煽阴风、点邪火，妄图分化和瓦解革命队伍。所以，革命派只有把自己当作革命的对象，认真地革自己的命，才能使革命队伍得到发展和巩固，才能夺取胜利巩固胜利。
    把自己当作革命的对象自然是一件痛苦的事。这是自己头脑里公与私之间、无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想之间的一场持续的激烈的斗争。但是，真正的革命派深深地懂得，革自己的命决不是额外的负担，而是为了使自己从旧世界的污泥浊水中彻底解放出来。所以，真正的革命派革自己的命，就必然不怕痛不怕丑，大造“私”字的反，一反到底。
    革命派要正确地对待自己，还必须打破种种局限性。一定要让自己跳出自己的范围，不能只看到自己。只看到自己，只看到自己的小集团，这是一种局限性。我是那个山头的，我就只顾那个山头，不顾其他的，这也是一种局限性。这种种局限性，归根到底就是一个
  “私”字，就是资产阶级的世界观。
    资产阶级的世界观同无产阶级的世界观是水火不相容的。用无产阶级世界观对待自己，就必然要求自己“公”字当头，毫不利己，专门利人，顾大局，识大体，永远忠于毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于人民。用资产阶级的世界观看待自己，那就是
  “私”字当头，自以为是，唯我独尊，老子天下第一，明明是不合理的要求也要得到满足。总之，用资产阶级的世界观看待自己，就是让“私”字在自己的头脑里掌权，发号施令。现在是向“私”字夺权的时候了。
    在激烈的阶级斗争中，正确地对待自己是十分重要的。我们看到有些人所以犯错误，或者有一个好的开头而不能保持晚节，原因就在于他们不用毛泽东思想挂帅，不相信群众，不能正确地对待自己。我们应当从这些人身上吸取应有的教训。
    我们无产阶级革命派所担负的任务是光荣的、艰巨的。党中央和毛主席对我们寄予很大的期望，广大的人民群众对我们寄予很大的期望。我们决不应该辜负这种期望。在这场触及人们灵魂的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们无产阶级革命派一定要用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，不断革命，不断前进，把改造客观世界和改造主观世界这两副担子同时挑起来。我们一定要清除自己队伍中的非无产阶级思想，使我们的队伍发展得更健康，更强大，从而在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来，联合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
