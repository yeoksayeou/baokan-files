The People's Liberation Army of the Guizhou Military Region recently dispatched a group of cadres to assist the Guiyang Railway Bureau in seizing the revolution and promoting production, resulting in a new situation in Guizhou Province's railway transportation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 24th: The People's Liberation Army of the Guizhou Military Region recently dispatched a group of cadres to assist the Guiyang Railway Bureau in seizing the revolution and promoting production, resulting in a new situation in Guizhou Province's railway transportation.

Currently, the majority of passenger and freight trains in the entire bureau are able to depart on schedule. The capacity of large and small stations to receive and dispatch trains, as well as the tonnage of goods sent, have all achieved new results. On March 17th alone, the number of cars unloaded throughout the bureau was more than ten cars higher than the previous highest record. As a result, the goods that had been accumulated at various stations in the previous period have been basically sent out, and the materials for spring plowing and industrial construction have been largely sent out in priority.

The PLA arrived at the Guiyang Railway Bureau on March 6th. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the army's outstanding political work, and insisted on the four firsts and the three-eight style, bringing Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies to all railway workers. On the evening of their arrival, they held a telephone conference to convey Mao Zedong's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on the army's support for industrial production to all workers in the bureau, which was supported by the broad masses of workers. Afterwards, they used the opportunity of various revolutionary mass organizations' meetings to repeatedly propagate Mao Zedong's call and the decisions of the Cultural Revolution to the broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres, making the party's policies and guidelines more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Many revolutionary workers proposed guarantees the day after the PLA arrived, expressing their determination to respond to Mao Zedong's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and to firmly guard their production posts. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who had previously left their production posts also returned to their work posts.

After the soldiers arrived at the railway transportation department, they actively propagated the party's cadre policy and propagated the importance of quickly forming temporary production leadership cadres at all levels to command the daily transportation work of the entire bureau. When various units' revolutionary mass organizations were discussing the absorption of good and relatively good leading cadres into the temporary production leadership cadres, the comrades of the PLA, on the one hand, did a large amount of in-depth and meticulous ideological work on the masses' active thoughts on the cadre issue; on the other hand, according to the spirit of the editorials of the fourth and fifth issues of the Red Flag magazine, they did political and ideological work on some cadres who had made mistakes, explained the policies to them, pointed out the future, and required them to put revolutionary interests first, to check their mistakes seriously on the one hand, and to lead boldly on the other, making amends for their mistakes. After the establishment of the production leadership cadres at all levels, they immediately took effective measures, dispatched cadres and technical personnel to the grassroots units to help organize and command, and quickly put the railway transportation on the right track, effectively supporting the production work of agriculture and industry. According to statistics, from March 6th to now, the amount of spring plowing materials transported by the entire bureau every day is 3,000 to 4,000 tons more than before.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "It is necessary to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to infuse Chairman Mao's thoughts into workers and peasants, to change the spiritual outlook of the working people, and to transform spiritual power into tremendous material power." After the PLA arrived at the railway department, they conscientiously carried out Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instruction, bringing the experience of the PLA's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works to the railway workers. They often studied Chairman Mao's works with the workers, participated in their discussions, and spread the experience of studying with problems, actively studying and applying, and combining learning with use. Now, many revolutionary mass organizations in the entire bureau have established systems for studying Chairman Mao's works. Many revolutionary workers in various teams, in combination with the current struggle situation, in combination with the workers' thoughts and the actual situation of their units, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts in the Party" and other brilliant works, making people's spiritual outlook completely renewed.

    把伟大的毛泽东思想带给工人同志
    贵州军区派出一批干部帮助贵阳铁路分局抓革命、促生产，使贵州省铁路运输出现一派新气象。
    据新华社贵阳二十四日电　中国人民解放军贵州省军区最近派出一批干部，帮助贵阳铁路分局抓革命、促生产，使贵州省铁路运输出现一派新气象。
    现在，全局客货车绝大部分都能正点发出，大小车站接、发车能力和发送货物的吨数，都创造了新成绩。只三月十七日一天，全局卸车数就比过去最高的卸车数还多了十多个车皮。因而前一时期各站积压的货物已基本发送出去，春耕生产和工业建设的物资，已大部优先运出。
    解放军是三月六日来到贵阳铁路分局的。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬部队的突出政治，坚持四个第一和三八作风等优良传统，把毛泽东思想和党的政策带给了全体铁路职工。他们到达的当天晚上，就召开了电话会议，向全局职工传达了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，和党中央及中央军委关于部队支持工业生产工作的决定，得到广大职工的拥护。以后，他们又利用各革命群众组织集会的机会，反复向广大职工和革命干部宣传毛主席的号召和文化大革命的各项决定、《红旗》杂志有关社论，使党的方针政策更加深入人心。许多革命职工在解放军来后第二天，就纷纷提出保证，表示一定要响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，坚守生产岗位。一些原来脱离生产的革命群众组织的负责人，也回到了工作岗位。
    指战员们到铁路运输部门以后，积极宣传党的干部政策，宣传迅速组成各级临时生产领导班子，指挥全局日常运输工作的重要意义。在各单位的革命群众组织酝酿吸收好的和比较好的领导干部参加临时生产领导班子时，解放军的同志们一方面针对群众对待干部问题暴露出来的活思想，做了大量深入细致的思想工作；一方面又根据《红旗》杂志四、五两期社论的精神，对一些犯过错误的干部，作政治思想工作，向他们交代政策，指出前途，要求他们以革命利益为重，一面认真检查自己的错误，一面大胆领导，将功补过。各级生产领导班子建立以后立即采取有力措施，派出干部和技术人员，到基层单位帮助组织和指挥，很快就使铁路运输走上正轨，有力地支援了工农业生产工作。据统计，从三月六日到现在，全局每天运输的春耕物资，比过去多三千到四千吨。
    林彪副主席说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”解放军到铁路部门后，认真贯彻执行林彪副主席的这一指示，把解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验带给了铁路职工。他们经常同职工们一起学习毛主席著作，参加他们的讨论会，向他们传播带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合的经验。现在全局已有不少革命群众组织建立了学习毛主席著作的制度。许多班组的革命职工，结合当前斗争形势，结合职工思想和本单位实际情况，认真学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，使人们的精神面貌焕然一新。
