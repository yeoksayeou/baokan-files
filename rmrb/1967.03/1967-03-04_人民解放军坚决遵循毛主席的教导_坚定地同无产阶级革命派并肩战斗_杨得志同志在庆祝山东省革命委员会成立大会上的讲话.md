Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, militiamen, and comrades in arms!

First of all, let us all wish our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao a long life! Long live Chairman Mao! We also wish Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, good health forever!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shandong Province, under the personal leadership of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, has achieved one splendid victory after another. Following the victory of the seizure of power in Qingdao, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the entire province united as one, with the force of a thunderbolt, and seized all the power usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They established the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. This splendid victory has given us tremendous encouragement. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Jinan Military Region, I extend my warmest congratulations and most resolute support! The Revolutionary Committee, with Comrade Wang Xiaoyu as its core leadership, is a proletarian headquarters that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee will follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and lead the people of the entire province to build a red and shining new Shandong. This is a new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are directed against oppression. All oppressed classes, all oppressed nations, all the exploited, are the enemies of the oppressors, of the exploiters, of the oppressor nations. This is a universal truth." The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, was born in the midst of fierce class struggle. Just as the revolutionary masses of the proletariat responded to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call to unite and wage the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road panicked and joined forces with the ghosts and snakes in society to engage in sabotage, split revolutionary organizations, incite the masses to fight each other, create counter-revolutionary incidents, and carry out white terror, attempting to achieve a capitalist restoration. We, the People's Liberation Army, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions and firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. With the assistance of the broad revolutionary masses, we, together with the public security organs, promptly suppressed the counter-revolutionaries. However, the enemy "will never resign themselves to their defeat and will make their last struggle." They spread rumors and slanders, create incidents, and repeatedly attacked military leadership organs, directing the spearhead of the struggle directly at the People's Liberation Army. Together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we launched a powerful political offensive, exposed the enemy's ugly face, and smashed the enemy's counterattack. In this sharp and complex struggle, the class consciousness of the broad masses has been raised, the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries have been strengthened, and the class feelings between the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses have been deepened. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Let us raise our arms and shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

Comrades! We have seized the power usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Shandong Province. This is only the beginning of the struggle, the first step of the long march. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, develop the great alliance with the "three-in-one combination" as its core, unite more than 95% of the cadres and masses, seize the revolution, promote production, and win the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To organize tens of millions of people, to mobilize a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." In the sharp struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must form a well-organized, disciplined, centrally led, and unified command revolutionary army. At present, we must first solve the problem of correctly handling revolutionary cadres. We must resolutely carry out and defend the correct policy of the "three-in-one combination," and unshakably implement the Party's traditional policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." We must see that in Shandong and throughout the country, the majority of cadres and Party members are good. Many revolutionary leading cadres have long adhered to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have stood with the broad revolutionary masses and waged unremitting struggles against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, undergoing severe tests. They have the ability to hold power and manage affairs for the proletariat and can and should become the backbone and core leadership of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries. We must trust them, support them, and help them. For cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and are not stubborn and unrepentant, we must give them the opportunity to reflect on and correct their mistakes. We must "approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." We must not kick them out of the revolutionary ranks, let alone beat them to death with one stick. We hope that cadres who have made mistakes will put down their burdens, dispel their worries, and bravely come forward to quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" also applies to Party members and League members who have been poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line in the movement, to revolutionary youngsters who have made mistakes, and to the masses who have been deceived and joined reactionary organizations. Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "We must be ruthless towards the enemy and lenient towards ourselves," "We must be good at uniting those who have opposed us and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, correctly handle the two types of contradictions, rely firmly on the revolutionary leftists, and through meticulous political and ideological work, win over the middle elements, unite the vast majority, and continuously develop and strengthen the revolutionary ranks, thoroughly isolating and striking at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and snakes in society. We must cherish the revolutionary youngsters and be on guard against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road taking advantage of the situation to counterattack and carry out class revenge.

Comrades! We must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and "be thrifty and make revolution." Revolutionary cadres in Party and government organs and revolutionary comrades on the industrial and agricultural fronts and in various sectors must put politics in command, guard their posts, work actively, manage enterprises well, and develop production. All comrades from outside should immediately return to their work and production posts, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism. At present, it is the spring plowing and sowing season. Revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and militiamen in the countryside must seize the agricultural time, quickly launch a spring production high tide. The broad officers and soldiers of the army must quickly take action, enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call, widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought, strongly support and help with spring plowing and production work, and strive for victory in both revolution and production. All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary mass organizations must practice thrift, not be extravagant, not show off, maintain and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. We must also heighten our vigilance and prevent class enemies from carrying out sabotage. Revolutionary comrades and militiamen must assist the People's Liberation Army and the public security organs to supervise the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, allowing them to behave themselves and not allowing them to cause trouble. If they dare to act recklessly, they will be severely punished. We must guarantee the production and living order of the people and the revolutionary order of the proletariat.

All the victories we have achieved are victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. In this great revolution that touches the soul, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and more diligently and painstakingly study and apply Chairman Mao's works. All revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and all officers and soldiers of the army must, according to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions, "consider ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, constantly consider ourselves as an object of the revolution." While transforming the objective world, actively transform the subjective world, carry out a great revolution in the depths of the soul, and seize the power of the "self." Officers and soldiers of the army going to factories, villages, and schools must humbly learn from workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, and together with comrades-in-arms of the proletarian revolutionaries, study and apply Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "Against Liberalism," and other brilliant works, as well as the important articles in the third and fourth issues of the "Red Flag" magazine, thoroughly eliminate small-groupism, factionalism, subjectivism, individualism, anarchism, and other non-proletarian thoughts from the revolutionary ranks, enhance revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and make our proletarian revolutionary ranks purer and more combat-effective.

Comrades, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have fallen into the predicament of being deserted by all and thoroughly isolated. The counter-revolutionary motley crew formed by them and the ghosts and snakes in society is crumbling. The revolutionary situation is excellent! However, the enemy will make a desperate struggle and launch a fierce counterattack. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are in collusion with the class enemies within the country, hysterically launching an anti-China wave, even carrying out military provocations. We "must never relax our fighting spirit." All of us, the officers and soldiers, will resolutely follow the instructions of the supreme commander Chairman Mao. No matter what storms and difficulties we encounter, we will always firmly stand with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and fight side by side with them. We are on high alert and ready for battle, prepared at any time to smash all the plots and sabotage activities of the class enemies at home and abroad, and are determined to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the proletarian iron fortress. If the enemy dares to act recklessly, we will break its backbone and completely annihilate it!

Comrades! Let us hold high the boundless red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be vigilant against arrogance and impetuosity, and continue to advance along the course opened up by the great helmsman Chairman Mao!

Long live the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!
Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    人民解放军坚决遵循毛主席的教导  坚定地同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗
    杨得志同志在庆祝山东省革命委员会成立大会上的讲话
    新华社济南三日电　中国人民解放军济南部队负责人杨得志同志在热烈庆祝山东省革命委员会成立大会上的讲话，全文如下：工人同志们，贫下中农同志们，红卫兵小将们，革命干部和革命知识分子同志们，民兵同志们，部队指战员同志们！
    首先让我们大家敬祝我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！敬祝毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席身体永远健康！
    山东省无产阶级文化大革命，在我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席亲自领导下，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。继青岛夺权斗争胜利之后，全省无产阶级革命派大联合，以雷霆万钧之势，又一举夺取了山东省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃取的一切大权，成立了山东省革命委员会。这一辉煌胜利，给了我们以极其巨大的鼓舞。我代表济南部队全体指战员，表示最热烈的祝贺，最坚决的支持！以王效禹同志为领导核心的革命委员会，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级司令部。山东省革命委员会将遵循毛主席指引的方向，领导全省人民建设一个红彤彤的新山东。这是无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！是毛泽东思想的新胜利！
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的山东省革命委员会，是在激烈的阶级大搏斗中诞生的。正当无产阶级革命派响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派慌了手脚，他们和社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结在一起，大搞分裂活动，破坏革命组织，挑动群众斗群众，制造反革命事件，实行白色恐怖，企图实现资本主义复辟。我们解放军坚决执行毛主席的伟大指示，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边。在广大革命群众协助下，我们和公安机关一起，及时镇压了反革命。但是，敌人
  “决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”他们造谣诬蔑，制造事端，多次冲击军事领导机关，把斗争锋芒直接指向了人民解放军。我们和无产阶级革命派一起，展开了强大的政治攻势，揭露了敌人的丑恶面目，粉碎了敌人的新反扑。在这场尖锐复杂的斗争中，提高了广大群众的阶级觉悟，壮大了无产阶级革命队伍，进一步加深了人民解放军和革命群众的阶级感情。这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！让我们振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
    同志们！我们夺了山东省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃取的大权，这仅仅是斗争的开始，万里长征的第一步。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发展以“三结合”为核心的大联合，团结百分之九十五以上的干部和群众，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利！
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争中，我们必须组成一支有组织有纪律的、有集中领导的、有统一指挥的革命大军。在当前，首先必须解决正确对待革命干部的问题。我们应当坚决执行和捍卫“三结合”的正确方针，毫不动摇地实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的党的传统政策。我们必须看到，山东和全国一样，大多数干部和党团员是好的。许多革命的领导干部长期坚持毛主席的革命路线，在文化大革命中，又和广大革命群众站在一起，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了不懈的斗争，经受了严峻的考验。他们有为无产阶级掌权和管理业务的能力，应当而且完全可以成为无产阶级革命派大联合的骨干和领导核心。我们应当信赖他们，拥护他们，支持他们。对于犯错误的干部，只要他们不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，我们应当给以检讨错误、改正错误的机会。要“亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”决不能把他们一脚踢开，排斥在革命队伍之外，甚至一棍子打死。我们希望犯过错误的干部，放下包袱，解除顾虑，勇敢地站出来，迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来！
    “惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，对于在运动中受资产阶级反动路线的毒害而犯错误的党团员，对于犯了错误的革命小将，对于受蒙蔽而参加了反动组织的群众，也是适用的。毛主席谆谆教导我们：要对敌狠，对己和，“要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，分清敌我，正确处理两类矛盾。要坚决依靠革命左派，通过细致的政治思想工作，争取中间派，团结绝大多数，不断发展和壮大革命队伍，彻底孤立和打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神。我们要注意爱护革命小将，警惕党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派趁机反扑，进行阶级报复。
    同志们！我们要热烈响应毛主席的
  “抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召。党政机关的革命干部和工农业战线以及各行各业的革命同志们，要突出政治，坚守岗位，积极工作，管好企业，发展生产。一切外地的同志，应当立即返回自己的工作岗位和生产岗位，挑起革命、生产两副重担，彻底粉碎反革命经济主义。当前，正是春耕春种季节。农村的革命干部、贫下中农和民兵同志们，要抓紧农时，迅速掀起春季生产高潮。部队广大指战员要迅速地行动起来，热烈地响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，广泛宣传毛泽东思想，大力支持、帮助春耕生产工作，争取革命、生产双胜利。一切革命同志和革命群众组织，都应当厉行节约，不讲排场，不摆阔气，保持和发扬无产阶级的革命精神。我们还要提高警惕，严防阶级敌人进行破坏。革命的同志们和民兵同志们，要协助人民解放军和公安机关，监督地、富、反、坏、右分子，只准他们老老实实，不准他们乱说乱动。如果他们胆敢妄为，定将严惩。一定要保障人民的生产和生活秩序，保障无产阶级的革命秩序。
    我们所取得的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加勤奋、更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作。广大革命干部、革命群众和部队全体指战员，要按照林彪副主席的指示，“把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”。在改造客观世界的同时，积极地改造主观世界，在灵魂深处大闹革命，抄“私”字的家，夺“私”字的权。部队指战员到工厂去，到农村去，到学校去，要虚心地向工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和广大革命干部学习，并同无产阶级革命派战友们一道，大学大用毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作，以及《红旗》杂志第三期、第四期社论等重要文章，彻底清除革命队伍中的小团体主义、山头主义、主观主义、个人主义、无政府主义等非无产阶级思想，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，使我们的无产阶级革命队伍更加纯洁，更有战斗力。
    同志们，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已陷入众叛亲离、彻底孤立的绝境，他们和社会上的牛鬼蛇神所结成的反革命小乌合，正在土崩瓦解。革命形势好得很！但是，困兽犹斗。阶级敌人还会作垂死挣扎，疯狂反扑。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，也在与国内的阶级敌人相呼应，歇斯底里地掀起反华浪潮，甚至进行军事挑衅。我们“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”。我们全体指战员坚决遵循最高统帅毛主席的指示，不管遇到什么惊涛骇浪，艰难险阻，始终坚定地同无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗。我们正在百倍警惕，严阵以待，随时准备粉碎国内外阶级敌人的一切阴谋和破坏活动，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级的铁打江山。敌人胆敢妄动，就打断它的脊骨，把它彻底消灭！
    同志们！让我们高高举起光焰无际的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，沿着伟大舵手毛主席开辟的航道奋勇前进！
    无产阶级革命派大联合万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
