Old poor peasant Feng Youda, after finishing his dinner, headed straight to the brigade headquarters. As he walked, he thought about the twenty or so PLA soldiers staying at the brigade headquarters. They were truly the people sent by Chairman Mao! As soon as they arrived in the village, without even drinking water or eating, they started beating drums and going door to door to read the letters from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the poor and lower-middle peasants. This instantly boosted our morale. When it came to work, every one of them was a strong hand. They worked from dawn till dusk every day, and during their rest time, they studied Chairman Mao's works and sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations with us. In our brigade of over a hundred people, who didn't praise the PLA soldiers as excellent?

Grandpa Feng thought more and more, and his smile widened. Suddenly, he remembered the task given to him by the brigade leader, and his smile vanished. During these days of the spring plowing production peak, in addition to working hard in the fields with the commune members every day, the PLA soldiers also secretly worked overtime at night to rush the work. The poor and lower-middle peasants and the brigade cadres were worried that they would overwork and collapse, so they asked Grandpa Feng to keep an eye on them and not let them work overtime anymore. Grandpa Feng knew that completing this task would be difficult, because before dinner, he heard the PLA soldiers discussing and planning to transport the remaining pile of fertilizer to the fields that night. Indeed, they might have already set out, so he had to hurry to "intercept" them. Thinking this, Grandpa Feng quickened his pace towards the brigade headquarters.

It was a coincidence that when Grandpa Feng arrived at the brigade headquarters, the twenty or so soldiers were all ready, some pushing carts, some carrying shovels, just about to leave. Leading the way were Deputy Political Instructor Qin Jun and the young soldier Jiang Shuisheng. Grandpa Feng saw this and immediately got anxious. He rushed forward, snatched the shovel from Deputy Political Instructor Qin's hand, and used his body to block Jiang Shuisheng's cart, sternly saying, "Put it down, all of you put down your tools!"

Jiang Shuisheng stuck out his tongue and nudged Deputy Political Instructor Qin with his elbow. Qin Jun quickly stepped forward, smiling and saying, "Grandpa Feng..."

"Go inside! We'll talk inside!" Grandpa Feng interrupted.

"Grandpa, we want to finish transporting this fertilizer so we can arrange other farm work. As the saying goes, 'A year's plan starts with spring,' and the season waits for no one!" Qin Jun tried to persuade Grandpa Feng.

"No! The commune members said there's no work for you tonight. Quickly, go lie down on the warm kang!" Grandpa Feng said.

"Grandpa!" Jiang Shuisheng said playfully, "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee sent us to help the poor and lower-middle peasants with spring plowing, not to lie on the warm kang!"

"After we finish transporting the fertilizer, we promise to rest well!" another soldier chimed in.

"No! This is what the poor and lower-middle peasants have decided. Even if you say something big, you have to rest tonight!" Grandpa Feng blocked the doorway with his body and said firmly.

Deputy Political Instructor Qin saw that he couldn't persuade Grandpa Feng, so he turned to the soldiers and said, "Alright! We'll listen to Grandpa Feng! We'll rest properly tonight!"

"That's right!" Grandpa Feng pulled Jiang Shuisheng over, "Little Jiang, even a tractor needs to refuel and add water after towing for a while. Let alone people." He finished, laughing heartily.

Grandpa Feng waited until the soldiers lay down and heard their snoring before he returned to his room. He lit the kerosene lamp, sat on the edge of the kang, and just as he took out his pipe, he suddenly stood up, "What if I fall asleep and they secretly start working again? No, I need to think of a way!" Grandpa Feng thought and went out, quietly arranging the small carts neatly under his window, thinking to himself, "As long as you move the carts, I'll know right away."

After tidying up, he listened to the steady snoring from the main room before he was satisfied and returned to his room.

It was deep into the night. Grandpa Feng sat under the lamp, smoking his pipe. Suddenly, his heart warmed, and he carefully took out the letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the poor and lower-middle peasants and the rural cadres from his chest. Wearing his old glasses, he read it aloud, word by word. Although he couldn't read many words, the soldiers had explained the meaning to him clearly. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Every word you say is in our hearts. Please rest assured, with your support, with your great thoughts guiding us, and with the PLA sent by you supporting us, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely achieve a double victory in revolution and production.

Grandpa Feng thought and thought, and he didn't know how long had passed when suddenly, the brigade leader rushed in, panting, "Grandpa! You were supposed to persuade them to rest, but they're working again?!"

"What?!" Grandpa Feng was stunned.

"The PLA is transporting fertilizer to the fields!" the brigade leader said.

"Transporting fertilizer?! But the carts are right here!" Grandpa Feng said doubtfully.

"Ah! They didn't use the wheeled carts!" the brigade leader said.

Grandpa Feng jumped off the kang, picked up the lantern, and rushed to the main room. It was empty, with no one inside. Grandpa Feng shone the light around and saw a blackboard on the wall with a glowing red quotation from Chairman Mao:

"Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people."

"Grandpa, the comrades have been working for half the night. The commune members have also gotten up to transport fertilizer, and now they are working enthusiastically! Let's go."

Grandpa Feng quickly turned around, holding the lantern, and ran towards the village entrance with the brigade leader.

At the fertilizer site, the PLA soldiers and the commune members were working side by side, with songs and slogans echoing, making the entire site bustling with activity.

Grandpa Feng looked around the crowd and finally found Deputy Political Instructor Qin. He scolded and worried, "Xin, you..."

"Grandpa!" Deputy Political Instructor Qin interrupted him, smiling, "We came to help the poor and lower-middle peasants with spring plowing. This is the task given to us by Chairman Mao. Now the brigade's spring plowing work is so busy, if we don't hurry up and finish, we won't sleep well!"

Grandpa Feng listened to these words, his eyes welling up with tears, and after a long time, he said, "You... you are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao!"

"Grandpa!" Jiang Shuisheng wiped the sweat from his face and said, "When I think of Chairman Mao's instruction to 'grasp revolution, promote production,' I can't hold back my energy!"

Little Jiang's words made Grandpa Feng laugh. He took off his jacket, picked up a shovel, and shouted, "Alright, let's work together!"

"Right!" Deputy Political Instructor Qin continued, "Let's work shoulder to shoulder, military and civilians, to complete the great task of grasping revolution and promoting production given to us by Chairman Mao!"

A red sun rose from the east, shining on the people working hard and the entire land. The sky was a bright red.

    毛主席给咱派来的解放军
    马浩流　陶嘉善
    老贫农冯友山大爷吃罢晚饭，抬腿就朝队部走去。他一边走，一边想着住在队部里的二十几个解放军同志，他们可真是毛主席派来的人哪！一进了村，水没喝，饭没吃，敲起锣鼓挨门挨户地给咱贫下中农念毛主席和党中央来的信，把咱们的劲头一下子给鼓起来了。论干活，个个是把硬手。他们成天起早摸黑地干，休息的工夫，还跟咱们一道学毛主席著作，唱毛主席语录歌。咱队里百十来口人，谁不说解放军同志是好样的！
    冯大爷越想越高兴，笑得都合不拢口。忽然，他想起了队长交给他的任务，笑容一下子消失了。原来，在这几天春耕生产高潮中，解放军同志除了跟社员一样，每天在地里豁出劲干以外，夜里还瞒着大伙悄悄地加班加点搞突击。贫下中农和队里的干部怕他们累垮了身子，决定叫冯大爷守着他们，再不让他们加班加点了。冯大爷知道要完成这个任务得费老大劲儿，因为晚饭前就听解放军同志在合计，想连夜把剩下的一堆粪送到地里。是啊，说不定他们这会儿就要出发了，咱得马上“挡驾”去，冯大爷想到这里，加快步伐朝队部走去。
    真巧，冯大爷来到队部的时候，二十几个战士都打点齐了，有的推小车，有的拿铁锨，正要往外走，打头的是副指导员秦峻和小战士江水生。冯大爷一看就急了，上前夺过秦副指导员手中的铁锨，又用身子挡住了江水生推着的小车，厉声说道：“放下，都给我把家伙放下！”江水生一吐舌头，用臂肘捅了副指导员一下。秦峻马上迈步上前，笑着说：“冯大爷……”
   “先进屋！有话屋里说！”
   “大爷，今儿我们想把那点粪送完，好安排别的农活。俗话说，一年之计在于春，季节不等人哪！”秦峻想劝说冯大爷。
   “不行！社员说了，今晚没你们的活，快趁这热炕躺下吧！”
   “大爷！”江水生俏皮地说：“毛主席和党中央是派咱们来帮助贫下中农搞春耕生产的，不是叫咱们来睡热炕的！”
   “把粪送完了我们保证好好休息！”另一个战士也插上一句。
   “不行！这是咱们贫下中农议定的，你们就是说出天大理来，今晚上也得歇着！”冯大爷用身子堵住门口，斩钉截铁地说。
    副指导员眼看说不通，便回过头来对战士们说：“好！咱们听冯大爷的！今晚上老老实实休息！”
   “这就对了！”冯大爷一把拉过江水生：“小江同志，就是拖拉机拖拉一阵子，还得加油加水呢！甭说人了。”说完，呵呵地笑了起来。
    冯大爷等同志们躺下，听到了香甜的鼾声以后，才放心地回到他住的下房。他点着煤油灯，往炕沿上一坐，刚掏出烟袋锅子，又腾地站了起来：“呆会儿我睡着了，没准儿他们又悄悄干开啦！不行，得想个办法！”冯大爷想着，又走了出去，轻手轻脚地把小推车一辆一辆整齐地排在自己的窗下，心里想：只要你们一动车，我马上就知道。
    收拾停当，又听了听从正房里传出的均匀的鼾声，他才满意地回到自己的屋里。
    夜深人静。冯大爷坐在灯下，抽着旱烟。忽然心头一热，小心地从怀里掏出毛主席和党中央给贫下中农和农村各级干部的那封信文，戴着老花眼镜，一个字一个字地轻声读着……。虽然他识不了几个字，可那信上的意思，解放军同志已经给他讲解得清清楚楚。毛主席啊毛主席！您老人家句句话都说在咱贫下中农的心坎儿上，请您老人家放心吧，有您给咱撑腰，有您的伟大思想给咱指路，有您派来的解放军大力支援，咱贫下中农坚决要夺个革命和生产双丰收。
    冯大爷想啊想……也不知道过了多长时辰，突然，生产队长气吁吁闯了进来：
   “大爷！叫您劝他们歇着，怎么又让他们干上了？！” 
   “啥？！”冯大爷愣了。
   “解放军在往地里送粪呢！”
   “送粪！？这小推车不是在这儿吗？”冯大爷半信半疑。
   “唉！人家不会用胶轮大车！”
    冯大爷“霍”地从炕上跳了下来，随手提起马灯，直奔正屋。屋里空洞洞的，没有一个人。冯大爷照了一下，只见墙头的小黑板上写着一条红光闪闪的毛主席语录：
    “我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    “大爷，同志们已经干了老半天，社员们也都起来送粪去了，现在正干得欢呢！咱们走吧。”
    冯大爷急忙扭转身子，提着马灯，和队长一块撒腿向村头粪场跑去。
    粪场里，解放军和社员们并肩战斗在一起，歌声、口号声此起彼伏，整个粪场，热气腾腾。
    冯大爷在人群里转了一圈，好容易找到了秦副指导员，又埋怨又心疼地说：“秦同志，唉！你们……”
    “大爷！”秦副指导员打断了他的话，笑呵呵地说：“我们来帮助贫下中农春耕，这是毛主席给我们的任务。现在队里春耕活儿这样忙，不抓紧干完，睡觉也不香啊！”
    冯大爷听了这番话，激动得热泪盈眶，半天才张口说：“你们……你们真是毛主席的好战士啊！”
      “大爷！”江水生一边抹着脸上的汗水，一边走过来说：“一想起毛主席
  ‘抓革命，促生产’的指示，我这浑身劲就憋不住啦！”
    小江一句话，把冯大爷也逗乐了，他扒下棉袄，抄起铁锨，喊道：“好，要干，咱们一块干！”
   “对！”秦副指导员接着说：“咱们军民肩并肩战斗，共同完成毛主席交给咱们的抓革命，促生产的伟大任务吧！”……
    一轮红日从东方升起来，照耀着正在紧张战斗的人们，照耀着整个大地。天宇间一片通红通红……。
