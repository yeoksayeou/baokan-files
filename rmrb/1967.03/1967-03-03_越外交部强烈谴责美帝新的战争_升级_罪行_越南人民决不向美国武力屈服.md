The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the extremely serious new war "escalation" crimes of U.S. imperialism. The Vietnamese people will never surrender to American force.

Hanoi, March 1 - The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today strongly condemning the extremely serious new war "escalation" crimes of U.S. imperialism. The full text of the statement is as follows:

U.S. imperialism is carrying out extremely serious new war "escalation" and has committed new heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people.

In the South, the total number of U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops has increased to more than one million and is continuing to increase. The U.S. aggressors are frantically pushing forward their new "dry season" strategic counteroffensive plan. They have launched multiple large-scale "sweeps" and at the same time are intensifying the so-called "pacification of the countryside" plan. They use napalm, chemical poisons, and poison gas and other barbaric weapons to carry out a scorched-earth policy. They are forcing people to relocate, destroying villages, damaging crops, and plundering food.

In the North, the U.S. is intensifying its bombing and strafing. In just the past four days, it has carried out three new "escalation" steps: using artillery stationed south of the demilitarized zone to shell the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; using warships to continuously shell the coastal areas of North Vietnam; and dropping mines into many rivers in North Vietnam. U.S. commanders are also threatening to bomb more targets, including the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong.

Not only that, the U.S. government is also hastening preparations to further strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. It has mobilized part of its reserve forces and increased its military budget. It has ordered members of the Southeast Asia Military Alliance and the U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Alliance, as well as vassals who have sent mercenary troops to South Vietnam, to provide more manpower and material support for its barbaric war of aggression. It has deployed B-52 bombers to Thailand, preparing to further interfere in the Kingdom of Laos, while also intensifying provocations and invading the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

It is clear that U.S. imperialism has not abandoned its aggressive ambitions. On February 2, 1967, U.S. President Johnson blatantly declared that the U.S. would "continue the war to the appropriate extent." On February 27, 1967, Johnson again clearly stated that the new military measures against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are aimed at having "a more powerful impact" on previous actions. The obvious facts show that the U.S. government is implementing a planned war "escalation" to strengthen the war of aggression in the South and escalate the destructive war in North Vietnam to a higher level. It has grossly violated the sovereignty and independence of the Vietnamese people, trampled on the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue, and seriously threatened the peace and security of the peoples of Southeast Asia and the world.

Accusing others while committing crimes is Johnson's usual trick. This time, he again hypocritically claims that the U.S.'s new military measures are "not escalation" but "the best way to bring peace." The U.S. aggressors have completely ignored world opinion. The U.S. is openly provoking the broad international opinion, including American public opinion, which is severely condemning it and demanding that it must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenaries from South Vietnam, and recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people.

The U.S. aggressors think that by expanding the destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they can stop the North from supporting the South and force the Vietnamese people to negotiate on their terms.

But the U.S. is gravely mistaken. The Vietnamese people will never surrender to force and will never negotiate under the threat of U.S. bombs. The Vietnamese people will further strengthen their unity, resolutely fight, defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country, contributing to the defense of peace in Asia and the world. The peoples of the socialist brother countries and all freedom-loving and justice-seeking peoples in the world, including the American people, will further strengthen their support and assistance for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

The best way out for the U.S. is: The U.S. must recognize the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war, must withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenaries from South Vietnam, must recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, and must allow the Vietnamese people to settle their internal affairs themselves.

The more U.S. imperialism escalates, the more it will suffer heavy defeats!

The Vietnamese people will surely achieve brilliant victories!

### 越外交部强烈谴责美帝新的战争“升级”罪行  越南人民决不向美国武力屈服

    越外交部强烈谴责美帝新的战争“升级”罪行
    越南人民决不向美国武力屈服
    新华社河内一日电　越南民主共和国外交部一日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的极其严重的新的战争“升级”罪行。声明全文如下：
    美帝国主义正在进行极其严重的新的战争“升级”，又对越南人民犯下了新的滔天罪行。
    在南方，美军、伪军和帮凶军总数已经增加到一百万名以上，并正在继续增加。美国侵略者正在疯狂地加紧推行它们的新的旱季“战略反攻”计划。它们接连发动多次大规模“扫荡”，同时加紧实现所谓“绥靖农村计划”。它们使用凝固汽油弹、化学毒药和毒气等野蛮的武器实行杀光、烧光、毁光。它们加紧集中居民，摧毁村庄，破坏庄稼，掠夺粮食。
    在北方，美国极力加强轰炸、扫射，仅在最近四天内，它又接连实行了三个新的“升级”步骤：用设在非军事区以南地区的大炮轰击越南民主共和国领土；用军舰连续炮轰越南北方沿海地区；向越南北方许多河流投放水雷。美国将领还叫嚷要轰炸更多的目标，包括首都河内和海防港口。
    不仅如此，美国当局还加紧准备进一步加强和扩大侵略越南的战争。它动用了一部分后备军队，增加军事预算。它命令东南亚军事侵略联盟和美澳新联盟的成员以及向越南南方派遣帮凶军的仆从，给它的野蛮的侵略战争提供更多的人力和物力。它派遣B—52型飞机进驻泰国，准备进一步干涉老挝王国，同时加强对柬埔寨王国的挑衅和侵犯柬埔寨王国的领土。
    很明显，美帝国主义并没有放弃它的侵略野心。美国总统约翰逊一九六七年二月二日明目张胆地宣称，美国“以应有的程度继续进行战争”。一九六七年二月二十七日，约翰逊又清楚地说，对越南民主共和国的新的军事措施，目的是为了对以前的行动起“更有力的影响”。明显的事实表明，美国当局正在实行有准备的战争“升级”计划，以便加强侵略南方的战争，使对越南北方的破坏性战争上升到更高的程度。它粗暴地侵犯了越南人民的主权和独立，践踏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，严重地威胁了东南亚和世界各民族的和平与安全。
    贼喊捉贼是约翰逊的惯技。这一次他又诡辩说，美国的新的军事措施“不是升级”，而是“带来和平的最好途径”。美国侵略者无视世界舆论真是到了极点。美国对正在严厉谴责它，要求它必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，必须把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线的各国广泛舆论，其中包括美国舆论，进行公开的挑衅。
    美国侵略者以为，它们扩大对越南民主共和国的破坏性战争，就可以制止越南北方对南方的支援，就可以迫使越南人民按照它的条件接受谈判。
    但是，美国大错特错了。越南人民决不在武力面前屈服，并且在任何时候也决不会在美国炸弹的威胁下进行对话。越南人民将进一步加强团结，坚决战斗，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。各社会主义兄弟国家的人民，全世界爱好自由和主持正义的人民，其中包括美国人民，将进一步加强对越南人民的正义斗争的支持和帮助。
    美国的最好的出路是：美国必须承认越南民主共和国的四项主张，必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，必须承认南方人民的唯一真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线，必须让越南人民自己解决自己的内部事务。
    美帝国主义越升级，就越要遭到惨重的失败！
    越南人民必将取得辉煌的胜利！
