	Spring Tide
	The ice has not yet melted, the snow has not yet disappeared, but the ice and snow cannot stop the footsteps of the commune members. Vehicles and horses dash about in front of and behind the village, and picks fly on the mountains. Revolution and production are both being pushed forward, igniting a great production upsurge. In the good teams, the commune members form a line carrying manure, leading the way is our good team leader. Revolution, chest out, labor, the old veteran. The masses and the cadres are united, production advances step by step. The poor peasant uncle innovates: driving the cart and carrying the manure basket. He says to promote production, one must think of ways, a commune member is worth two busy ones, can I just hold the whip and have idle shoulders? One must listen to Chairman Mao's words, give off light wherever there is heat!

	The propagandist goes to the fields, working and resting but never stopping talking, carrying a bamboo flute and bamboo clapper, spreading the thoughts of Mao Zedong. Seize the revolution, promote production, listen a thousand times, ten thousand times, and never get tired. The production upsurge is red like fire, the propagandist adds oil to the fire. The soldiers assist the farmers, shining stars, entering the mountains. Old team leader, old commander, carrying fertilizer side by side. In the past, they fought side by side against the enemy, today they compete in carrying the shoulder poles. The hearts of workers and peasants are connected, the telephone rings loudly, the team leader smiles at the receiver, workers from the city call, trucks full of fertilizer arrive. Putting down the receiver and running out the door, the driver greets with a laugh, the red hearts of workers and peasants are connected, two big hands grasp tightly!

    春潮
    舒衡春潮冰未化，雪未消，冰雪封不住社员脚；村前村后车马窜，山上山下飞大镐。革命、生产一起抓，掀起生产大高潮。好队长社员挑粪排成行，当头是咱的好队长。革命，挺起胸，劳动，是老将。干群一股绳，生产步步长。独创肥车排成行，鞭子震天响，贫农大伯搞独创：赶着车儿挑粪筐。他说促生产，要把门道想，社员一个顶俩忙，我还能光掌鞭子闲肩膀？要听毛主席的话，有一分热，发一分光！宣传员宣传员到田间，干活休息嘴不闲，竹笛竹板随身带，毛泽东思想来宣传。抓革命，促生产，千遍万遍听不厌，生产高潮红似火，宣传员火上把油添。助农颗颗红星金闪闪，战士助农进了山。老队长，老首长，挑起肥来肩并肩。当年并肩把敌杀，今天双双赛扁担。工农心连心电话铃哇哇叫，队长对着听筒笑，城里工人来电话，汽车满载化肥到。放下听筒门外跑，司机迎面呵呵笑，工农红心连红心，两只大手握的牢！
