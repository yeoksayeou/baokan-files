Telegram of Salutations from the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee to Chairman Mao

New China News Agency, Jinan, February 1st: Telegram of Salutations from the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee to Chairman Mao

Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader, the Reddest Red Sun in Our Hearts, Chairman Mao:

Today, under your loving care and with the full support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong, we, the revolutionary masses of Shandong Province, have risen up with great determination and, in one decisive battle, captured the fortress of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, which had long been controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We have declared the death of the old Provincial Party Committee and the old Provincial People's Committee, the bourgeois headquarters, and the birth of the new provisional power organ—the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. With hearts full of excitement, we report this joyous news to you and wish you eternal life! Eternal life!!

Respected Chairman Mao: The handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have long pursued a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They opposed emphasizing politics, opposed the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, advocated class reconciliation, promoted material incentives, opposed the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and carried out a capitalist restoration. Since the Cultural Revolution, they have stubbornly pursued a bourgeois reactionary line, using the machinery of dictatorship to suppress revolutionary masses, creating a white terror, promoting counter-revolutionary economism, cultivating their own organizations, and thus maintaining their reactionary rule. When they saw their end approaching, they colluded with some so-called "leftist" leaders, joining forces to preserve their strength and wait for an opportunity to rise again. We revolutionary masses have seen through their reactionary nature. On the basis of great unity, we have formed a "three-in-one" command center and, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," seized the opportunity, pursued the enemy relentlessly, and seized back the great powers of party, government, finance, and culture that they had usurped. This seizure is right! It is good! The revolutionary people of the entire province are proud and joyful, shouting in unison: This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Respected Chairman Mao, we report to you: In this decisive battle for seizing power, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong has firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses and taken a series of major revolutionary actions, making brilliant achievements for the victory of the seizure of power. They are truly the people's army created by your hands! They are truly our good examples to learn from!

Respected Chairman Mao, we pledge to you: We will definitely follow your teachings, continue to expand the proletarian revolutionary army of the "three-in-one" combination, and thoroughly complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will definitely follow the policies you have set, correctly handle cadres. For cadres who stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we will firmly rely on them and fight shoulder to shoulder. For cadres who have made mistakes, we will adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," helping them correct their mistakes and uniting with them to do good work; even for cadres who have made very serious mistakes, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and insist on not changing or are incorrigible, we will allow them to reform and encourage them to redeem themselves. For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we will fully expose them and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink. We will definitely respond to your great call of "grasp revolution, promote production," shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and ensure double victories in revolution and production!

Respected Chairman Mao, we pledge to you: We will forever and ever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, being your good students and good soldiers. We will break down the "self" and establish the "public," and in the great furnace of the Cultural Revolution, thoroughly reform our worldview, vowing to make our new Shandong a red school of Mao Zedong Thought! Let the invincible and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought shine forever and ever over all of Shandong, all of China, and all the world!

    山东省革命委员会给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社济南一日电　山东省革命委员会给毛主席的致敬电最最敬爱的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的
  红太阳毛主席：
    今天，我们山东省无产阶级革命派，在您的亲切关怀下，在中国人民解放军驻山东地区部队的全力支持下，奋起千钧棒，一举攻克了多年来
  一直被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派把持的省委、省人委这座顽固堡垒，宣告了旧省委、旧省人委资产阶级司令部的死亡和新的临时权力机构——山东省革命委员会的诞生。我们怀着万分激动的心情向您老人家报喜，祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！
      敬爱的毛主席：前山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来，推行了一条反革命修正主义路线。他们反对突出政治，反对毛泽东思想挂帅，鼓吹阶级调和，大搞物质刺激，反对社会主义革命和社会主义建设，实行资本主义复辟。文化大革命以来，他们又顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，动用专政机器，镇压革命群众，制造白色恐怖，大搞反革命经济主义，培植御用组织，借以保持自己的反动统治。当他们看到自己末日来临的时候，又与一些所谓“左派”组织的反动头目，互相勾结，狼狈为奸，妄图保存实力，伺机东山再起。我们无产阶级革命派，看透了他们的反动本质，在大联合的基础上，组成了“三结合”的指挥中枢，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，抓住战机，猛追穷寇，把他们窃踞的党、政、财、文等大权夺了回来。这个权夺得对！夺得好！全省的革命人民，扬眉吐气，齐声欢呼：这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
      敬爱的毛主席，我们向您报告：在这场夺权斗争的大决战中，中国人民解放军驻山东地区部队，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，采取了一系列重大的革命行动，为夺权斗争的胜利立下了辉煌的战功。他们不愧为您亲手缔造的人民子弟兵！他们真正是我们学习的好榜样！
      敬爱的毛主席，我们向您保证：我们一定遵照您的教导，继续扩大“三结合”的无产阶级革命大军，彻底完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定遵照您规定的政策，正确地对待干部。对站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边的革命干部，我们要坚决依靠，并肩战斗。对犯错误的干部，我们要采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，帮助他们改正错误，团结他们做好工作；就是犯了很严重错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，也要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。对一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，我们要充分揭露，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。我们一定响应您的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，挑起革命、生产两副重担，保证革命、生产双胜利！
      敬爱的毛主席，我们向您保证：我们永远永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好学生、好战士。我们要大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在无产阶级文化大革命的洪炉中彻底改造世界观，誓把我们新山东办成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！让伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉永远永远普照全山东，全中国，全世界！ 
                    山东省革命委员会
                          一九六七年二月三日
