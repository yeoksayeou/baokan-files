Mother Stands on Chairman Mao's Side

My mother is a production brigade leader.

Recently, she wrote to me saying that during the Cultural Revolution, the community members posted some big-character posters about her, and she felt resistant, thinking it would be better not to be the brigade leader.

After reading Mother's letter, I felt her mood was off. I decided to help Mother raise her class consciousness.

I wrote her several letters in a row. Each letter addressed her current thoughts, using Chairman Mao's teachings to help her solve her ideological problems. For example, when Mother did not want to be the brigade leader, I told her about Chairman Mao's words, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." I explained that without power, there is nothing, and with power, there is everything. Controlling the power of the production brigade is controlling the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I helped her recall an incident: In 1945, my father was nearly tortured to death by the landlord because the power was in the hands of the landlord. After liberation, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we seized the power from the landlords, and only then did we begin to control our own destiny and have today's happy life.

I told Mother: Our power is hard-won! Today, if we poor and lower-middle peasants abandon our responsibilities and do not seize power, we are falling into the trap of the class enemy. Once those ghosts and snakes seize power, we will return to the life of being worse than cattle and horses before liberation. I also pointed out to Mother that Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings." The poor and lower-middle peasants criticizing our shortcomings and mistakes is a good thing, and we must humbly accept them.

Soon, Mother wrote back saying: "After reading your letters and recalling the past hardships, I realized that my previous thought of not wanting to be the brigade leader was very wrong. The class brothers pointing out my shortcomings and mistakes is the greatest care and help for me. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, correct my mistakes, and take up the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production."

A few days later, a comrade from the village wrote to say that my mother had joined the revolutionary faction, actively responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and together with all the revolutionary community members, she participated in the struggle while leading production. I heard this news, and my heart was filled with indescribable joy.

    妈妈站到了毛主席一边
    解放军某部五好战士　李远良
    我的妈妈是个生产队长。
    不久前，她给我来信说，在文化大革命运动中，社员们给她贴了些大字报，她思想有抵触，觉得还是不当队长好。
    看了妈妈的来信，我觉得她的情绪不对头。我决心帮助妈妈提高阶级觉悟。
    我接连给妈妈写了几封信。每一封信，都是针对妈妈的活思想，用毛主席的教导，来帮助她解决思想问题。比如，妈妈不愿意当队长，我就把毛主席说的“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的道理告诉她，说明没有政权就没有一切，有了政权，就有了一切。掌握生产队的大权就是掌握贫下中农的命根子。我帮助她回忆这样一件事：一九四五年，父亲差点被地主折磨死，就是因为印把子在地主手里。解放了，毛主席领导我们夺了地主的权，才开始掌握自己的命运，才有了今天的幸福生活。
    我告诉妈妈：我们的印把子来之不易啊！今天，如果我们贫下中农撂挑子，不去掌权，正是中了阶级敌人的诡计。一旦让那些牛鬼蛇神掌了权，我们就会重新过解放前那种牛马不如的生活。我还向妈妈指出，毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”贫下中农批评我们的缺点错误，这是一件好事，一定要虚心接受。
    不久，妈妈来信说：“看了你的信，回忆过去的苦，我认识到了过去不想当队长的思想是很错误的。阶级兄弟指出我的缺点错误，这是对我最大的爱护和帮助。我一定听毛主席的话，改正错误，把革命、生产的重担挑起来。”
    几天后，村里的同志来信说，我妈妈参加了革命派组织，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，和全队革命社员一起，一面参加斗争，一面领导生产。我听到这个消息，心里有说不出的高兴。
