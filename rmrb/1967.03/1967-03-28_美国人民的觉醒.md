American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the entire world, and it is also the most vicious enemy of the American people.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out, “The American reactionaries want to instigate war; they must first attack the American people.” Since the end of World War II, American imperialism, in order to realize its ambition of dominating the world, has been frantically expanding its military and preparing for war. It has been implementing fascist rule within the United States, brutally oppressing and exploiting the American working people. As the American imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam fails, its attacks on the American people have intensified.

Chairman Mao has pointed out, “The American people should rise up to resist the attacks of the American reactionaries. I believe they will do so.”

This is indeed the case. The aggressive activities of American imperialism in Vietnam and around the world, and its attacks on the American people, have awakened the American people. The broad masses of the American people have risen up to resist the attacks of the American reactionaries. More and more American people are participating in the struggle against the war in Vietnam, demanding an immediate halt to the massacre of the Vietnamese people and the withdrawal of American aggression troops from South Vietnam. More and more American youth are refusing to serve in the military. They would rather go to jail than become cannon fodder in the war of aggression. The American people are opening up a front against American imperialism within the United States.

American imperialism is having a harder and harder time both at home and abroad. One day, the American people will, together with the people of the world, hang American imperialism.

    美国人民的觉醒
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人，也是美国人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    毛主席早就说过，“美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。”第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义为了实现它称霸世界的侵略野心，大肆扩军备战，在美国国内实行法西斯统治，穷凶极恶地压迫和剥削美国的劳动人民。随着美帝国主义侵越战争的失败，它对美国人民的进攻更为加紧了。
    毛主席曾经指出，“美国人民应当起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻。我相信他们是会这样做的。”
    事实正是这样。美帝国主义在越南和全世界进行的侵略活动和对美国人民的进攻，促进了美国人民的觉醒。广大美国人民起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻了。美国人民越来越广泛地参加了反对侵越战争的斗争行列，要求立即停止屠杀越南人民，把美国侵略军撤出南越。越来越多的美国青年拒绝服兵役。他们宁愿坐牢也不肯充当侵略战争的炮灰。美国人民正在美国国内开辟一条反对美帝国主义的战线。
    美帝国主义无论在国外还是国内，日子越来越不好过了。总有一天，美国人民将和全世界人民一起，把美帝国主义处以绞刑。
