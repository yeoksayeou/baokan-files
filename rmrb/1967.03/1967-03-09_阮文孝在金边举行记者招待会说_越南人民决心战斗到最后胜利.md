Nguyen Van Hieu, a member of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, held a press conference here on the morning of the 7th. He reaffirmed the five-point principled stand of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in its March 22, 1965 statement.

Nguyen Van Hieu said in his speech: "Our people and our army are growing stronger in battle. The change in the balance of forces on the ground shows that we are not only able to resist the strongest imperialism but also to defeat its invading army, making them suffer heavier and heavier defeats until we achieve final victory."

He pointed out: "Whether it is savage threats or treacherous peace tricks, they cannot shake our position in the slightest."

Nguyen Van Hieu emphasized at the press conference: "We are closely united with our northern brothers and will fight to the end, driving every last American aggressor off our beloved land."

He expressed firm support for the heroic struggle of the Cambodian people and the Lao people against American imperialism and its lackeys.

Nguyen Van Hieu distributed a statement issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28 at the press conference.
