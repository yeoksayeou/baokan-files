The Guiyang Cotton Mill, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, has formed unions based on administrative departments, which has greatly promoted both the revolution and production.

This mill has over a thousand revolutionary rebels belonging to seventeen different organizations. After seizing power together, each group wanted to hold the reins of power, and conflicts became more acute. They then held meetings to "unify thoughts," but without Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and with each organization standing on its own, they argued for half a month without results. Under the repeated demands of the masses, the various organizations held open criticism and self-criticism sessions. During these sessions, they repeatedly studied the "Three Old Articles" and the editorials of the *Red Flag* magazine. Using Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of great unity, they thoroughly criticized and repudiated individualism, sectarianism, and small-groupism. For example, some of the larger revolutionary rebel organizations in the headquarters said: "We were established the earliest and have the greatest merits. If we are to unite, it would be best for some of the smaller organizations to disband and join ours." The masses refuted this by saying: "Revolution does not distinguish between early and late, and organizations do not distinguish between large and small. Unity should be based on what is beneficial to the revolution." Some people were afraid that unifying based on departments would turn into a hodgepodge. Everyone analyzed that unifying based on departments meant that they knew each other best and could indeed prevent a hodgepodge.

Based on the unification of thoughts, the preparation workshop was the first to establish a united combat team, which took charge of all the workshop's powers. The members of each organization in this workshop announced their withdrawal from their original headquarters and declared that they would only execute orders from the higher-level united headquarters and would not execute any orders from any other headquarters. Now, five workshops and some work teams have united in this form. After the unification, both the revolution and production have taken on a new look. Most of the united work teams have established a system for studying Chairman Mao's works. In the past, some of the masses who had not joined any organization felt like they were not wanted. Now, they have united around the united combat team, participating in the class's daily post-work study and exercise for one and a half hours. Organizational discipline has greatly strengthened, and the production situation has also changed significantly. Some workers who used to manage twenty-four machines now manage thirty-six, and even volunteer to manage forty-eight.

On February 20, the entire mill held a great unity oath-taking rally. This new thing of unifying from the bottom up based on departments has been widely praised.

    用毛泽东思想做为大联合的灵魂
    贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门搞联合
    组织纪律性大大加强，革命和生产出现新面貌
    新华社贵阳二十八日电　贵阳棉纺厂在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权以后，按车间等行政部门搞联合，对革命和生产都起了很好的促进作用。
    这个厂一千多名革命造反派分属十七个组织。联合夺权以后，都想掌大权，矛盾更尖锐了。于是就开会“统一思想”，但由于没有以毛泽东思想挂帅，加之组织上自立门户，吵了半个月没有结果。在群众一再要求下，各组织开门整风。整风时，反复学习“老三篇”和《红旗》杂志社论。以毛泽东思想做为大联合的灵魂，大破“私”字，横扫宗派主义、小团体主义等错误思想。如总部的一些较大的革命造反团体，他们说：“我们成立最早，功劳最大，要联合，最好是一些人数不多的组织解散，并入我们的组织。”群众就反驳道：“革命不分先后，组织不分大小，怎样联合对革命有利，就该怎样联合。死抱住总部不放，实际上是小山头主义。”还有些人怕按部门大联合成为大杂烩。大家又分析，按部门搞联合，互相最了解，正可以防止大杂烩。
    在搞通思想的基础上，准备车间首先成立了联合战斗队，掌管车间一切权力。这个车间各组织的成员都宣布退出原来的总部，声明除了上级联合总部的命令以外，不再执行任何一个总部的命令。现在已有五个车间和一部分班组按这个形式联合起来。联合以后，革命和生产都出现了新面貌。凡联合的班组，大都建立了毛主席著作学习制度。过去一些“没有参加组织就好象没有人要”似的中间群众，也团结到联合战斗队周围，参加了班里每天下班后一小时半的学习和运动。组织纪律性大大加强了，生产面貌也变化很大。有的工人同志过去一人看二十四台机器，现在看三十六台，并主动提出看四十八台。
    二月二十日全厂召开了大联合誓师大会。自下而上按部门大联合这一新生事物得到了普遍的赞扬。
