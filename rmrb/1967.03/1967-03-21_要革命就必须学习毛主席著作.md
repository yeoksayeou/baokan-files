A youth movement leader from Zanzibar and his friends, after studying Chairman Mao's famous work "The Direction of the Youth Movement," often organize youths to go to the countryside to help farmers harvest rice, and to farms or construction sites to do voluntary labor.

On another note, on a construction site in Tanzania built with Chinese aid, an African truck driver, after reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," showed even greater enthusiasm for work. He told the Chinese experts: "In Africa, imperialism is like a big mountain pressing down on the African people. We should use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man to remove this mountain. Only through our arduous struggle can we achieve victory." He also said, "The oppressed peoples of the world, if they want to stand up, must study Mao Zedong Thought."

   要革命就必须学习毛主席著作
    一位桑给巴尔青年运动领导人和他的朋友们在学习了毛主席的著名著作《青年运动的方向》之后，他们根据毛主席的教导，常常组织青年下乡去帮农民收割稻子，到农场或建筑工地进行义务劳动。
    另外在坦桑尼亚中国援建工地上，有个非洲卡车司机在读了《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》后，在工作中表现出更大的劳动热情。他对中国专家说：在非洲，殖民主义者象一座大山一样压在非洲人民的头上。我们应该用愚公那种不屈不挠的精神来搬掉这座大山。只有通过我们艰苦的斗争，我们才能取得胜利。他还说：“世界上被压迫的人民，如果要站起来，就必须学习毛泽东思想。”
