Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered an important speech at the Party activists' conference in Kruja District, emphasizing the need to strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and promote ideological revolutionization.

According to a report by the New China News Agency from Tirana on the 26th, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" reported that on the 24th, the Labor Party of Albania held a conference of activists in Kruja District to discuss issues such as "measures that must be taken to strengthen agricultural cooperatives in the mountains."

Comrade Enver Hoxha, the First Secretary of the Labor Party Central Committee, attended this conference and delivered an important speech.

In his speech, Comrade Hoxha praised the achievements of the Party members, activists, and working people of Kruja District in advancing along the path of agricultural collectivization as indicated by the Party. He said that the transition from individual ownership to collective ownership is a great material change, a revolution in both material and ideological aspects. Therefore, we must do a lot of work in the realm of ideological consciousness because the revolutionization of ideological consciousness is more arduous.

Comrade Hoxha particularly emphasized the necessity of studying the theory of class struggle. He said that this theory must be closely linked with life, and explained and analyzed in a simple and understandable manner. One must correctly understand the Party's directives and strictly execute the Party's directives, that is, to understand the theoretical principles of our Party.

Comrade Hoxha also spoke about the importance of strengthening the Party and the further revolutionization of the Party's grassroots organizations and members.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the Party must continuously be infused with new blood to establish iron discipline, to fight against factionalism, patriarchal, feudal, and tribal societal old views, to heighten revolutionary vigilance. Communist Party members must always stand at the forefront of the masses, become examples in overcoming difficulties in labor and struggle, become highly mature examples in political and ideological consciousness, be both students and teachers of the masses.

Those who attended this conference included cadres from various agricultural cooperatives, industrial and mining enterprises, and Party committee organs in Kruja District, as well as secretaries of grassroots Party organizations and comrades who volunteered to work in mountain cooperatives for one to three years.

After attending the conference, on the 25th, Comrade Hoxha, accompanied by Pirro Kondi, the First Secretary of the Kruja District Party Committee, and Ibrahim Xhina, the Chairman of the Kruja District People's Assembly Executive Committee, inspected some factories and agricultural cooperatives in the district. When Comrade Hoxha inspected the weaving workshop of the "September 22" handicraft cooperative, he spoke to the female workers about further liberating women. Comrade Hoxha instructed that those women who have not yet participated in social labor should be mobilized to join production, and that it is necessary to fight against backward customs and religious prejudices, oppose early marriages, arranged marriages, and marriage by purchase, and defend the rights of women.

Comrade Hoxha also visited the Fushë-Krujë Cement Factory, which was built with the help of China, and the "Partisan" Agricultural Cooperative Union in Fushë-Krujë.

    加强阶级斗争观念　促进思想革命化
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　据阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》报道：阿尔巴尼亚克鲁亚区二十四日举行了劳动党的积极分子会议，讨论“关于加强山区农业合作社必需采取的措施”等问题。
    劳动党中央第一书记霍查同志出席了这次会议，并在会上作了重要讲话。
    霍查同志在讲话中赞扬了克鲁亚区的党员、党的积极分子和劳动人民在党所指出的农业合作化的前进的道路上所取得的成绩。他说，从个人所有制过渡到集体公有制，这是一个巨大的物质变化，是物质和思想方面的一场革命。所以，我们应当在思想意识领域里进行很多工作，因为思想意识的革命化更为艰巨。
    霍查同志特别谈到研究阶级斗争理论的必要性。他说，要把这一理论与生活紧密地联系起来，进行简明易懂的解释和分析。要正确地理解党的指令，正确和严肃地执行党的指令，也就是说要理解我们党的理论原则。
    霍查同志还谈到关于健全党的重要性，以及党的基层组织和党员的进一步革命化的重要性。
    霍查同志指出，要不断用新的血液充实党，为确立钢铁般的纪律，为反对小团体主义、宗法的、封建的、宗族社会的旧的世界观而斗争，要提高革命警惕性。共产党员要随时随地站在群众的前面，成为在劳动和斗争中克服困难的榜样，成为政治思想意识上高度成熟的榜样，是群众的学生和老师。
    参加这次会议的有：克鲁亚区各农业合作社、工矿企业、党委机关的干部，党的基层组织的书记和志愿去山区合作社劳动一年到三年的同志。
    霍查同志出席会议以后，二十五日在克鲁亚区委第一书记皮罗·康迪和区人民会议执行委员会主席易卜拉欣·西纳的陪同下视察了这个区的一些工厂企业和农业社。当霍查同志视察“九月二十二日”手工业合作社的织布车间时，他向女工们谈到了进一步解放妇女的问题。霍查同志指示，要动员那些还没有参加社会劳动的妇女参加生产，必须同落后习俗和宗教偏见作斗争，反对早婚、包办和买卖婚姻，保卫妇女的权利。
    霍查同志还参观了由中国帮助建设的富什—克鲁亚水泥厂和富什—克鲁亚的“游击队”农业合作社联合社。
