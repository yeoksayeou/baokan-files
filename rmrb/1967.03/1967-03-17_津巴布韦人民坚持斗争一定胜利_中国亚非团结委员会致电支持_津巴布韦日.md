The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity sent a telegram on March 15 to the Zimbabwe African National Union in support of "Zimbabwe Day" on March 17. The telegram expresses the strong support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Zimbabwean people against imperialism and its lackeys in their quest for national independence.

The telegram states: The people of Zimbabwe are uniting and taking up armed struggle to resist the counter-revolutionary regime of Smith, the puppet of Anglo-American imperialism. This resistance is justified! The Soviet modern revisionists, in collusion with American imperialism, are sabotaging the Zimbabwean national independence movement. The awakened people of Zimbabwe will certainly resist Soviet modern revisionism. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true strength does not lie with the reactionaries but with the people." In the face of the people of Zimbabwe, who have a long tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, any plot by imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries will meet with utter failure.

The telegram states: The Chinese people are deeply convinced that as long as the people of Zimbabwe strategically despise the enemy but tactically take the enemy seriously, resolutely decide to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, they will surely be able to ultimately drive out Anglo-American imperialism, thoroughly defeat the Smith puppet regime, and achieve national independence and liberation. The final victory will surely belong to the four million people of Zimbabwe!

    津巴布韦人民坚持斗争一定胜利
    中国亚非团结委员会致电支持“津巴布韦日”
    新华社十六日讯　中国亚非团结委员会十五日致电津巴布韦非洲民族联盟，支持三月十七日“津巴布韦日”。电报表示，中国人民对津巴布韦人民反对帝国主义及其走狗、争取民族独立的斗争，表示强烈的支持。
    电报说：津巴布韦人民正在团结起来，走上武装斗争的道路，造美、英帝国主义及其走狗史密斯傀儡政权的反，这个反造得好！苏联现代修正主义伙同美帝国主义破坏津巴布韦民族独立运动，觉醒起来的津巴布韦人民当然也要造苏联现代修正主义的反。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”在具有长期反帝斗争传统的津巴布韦人民面前，帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的任何阴谋都将遭到彻底失败。
    电报说：中国人民深信，只要津巴布韦人民在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，就一定能够最后赶走英帝国主义，彻底打倒史密斯傀儡政权，取得民族独立和解放。最后胜利必定属于四百万津巴布韦人民！
