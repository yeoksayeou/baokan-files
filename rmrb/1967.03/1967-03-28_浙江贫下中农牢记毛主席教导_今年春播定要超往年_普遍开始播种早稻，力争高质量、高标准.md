Zhejiang Province's rural areas have entered the early rice sowing season. Over three million mu of seedlings covered with plastic film have already sprouted leaves; in other areas where plastic film is not used for seedling cultivation, sowing is currently underway in all seedling fields.

During the spring sowing period, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Zhejiang's rural areas have been studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, firmly remembering Chairman Mao's instructions: "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leading comrades, workers, and people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve greater results than last year." They have also repeatedly studied the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," which has greatly inspired them. They are determined to make this year's spring plowing and sowing better than any previous year. Many regions have carefully selected and exchanged high-quality seeds before spring sowing. At the same time, the revolutionary cadres of the grain department have also helped to allocate and supply a large number of high-quality seeds and sent many cadres with Mao Zedong's works and sieves to the production teams, actively helping to select seeds and ensure sowing quality.

To make this year's spring sowing even better, many regions have held sowing technology training classes, taught advanced techniques, and shared experiences in early rice sowing and seedling cultivation, striving to achieve high quality and high standards.

    浙江贫下中农牢记毛主席教导
    今年春播定要超往年
    普遍开始播种早稻，力争高质量、高标准
    据新华社杭州二十七日电　浙江省农村已进入早稻播种季节。全省三万多亩采用塑料薄膜覆盖的秧苗已经吐叶；其它不采用塑料薄膜覆盖育秧的地区，目前正在秧田普遍播种。
    浙江农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，在春播期间，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，牢记毛主席的教导：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”他们还反复地学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，受到了极大的鼓舞，决心把今年春耕播种工作搞得比过去任何一年都好。许多地区在春播前，都认真进行精选种籽和调换良种。同时，粮食部门的无产阶级革命派，也帮助调拨供应了大批良种，并且派出大批干部带着毛主席著作，带着淌筛，深入生产队，积极帮助精选种籽，保证播种质量。
    为了把今年的春播工作搞得更好，许多地区还举办了播种技术训练班，传授先进技术，交流早稻播种育秧经验，力求达到高质量、高标准。
