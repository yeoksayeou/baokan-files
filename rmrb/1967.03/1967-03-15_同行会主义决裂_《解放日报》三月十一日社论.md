Title: Breaking with Guildism

Guildism is a type of thought that is detrimental to the current proletarian revolutionary faction's efforts to unite across industries, systems, units, and departments. It carries a feudalistic color. Those who act according to guildism do not set their struggle goals based on the overall and long-term interests of the working class and the laboring people. They do not organize their forces according to class distinctions. Instead, they organize their forces based on professions and trades, and they set their current struggle goals based on the partial and immediate interests of their own profession and trade. This guildist thought is highly detrimental to the current proletarian cultural revolution.

Guildism splits the ranks of the working class. In a single unit, if workers of different trades and professions each form their own organizations and have their own struggle goals, this will cause the workers in that unit to become fragmented and unable to form a united and powerful force.

Guildism is not conducive to the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Organizations formed by different trades and professions may also struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, but they often do so in a scattered manner according to their own systems and demands. Such exposés and struggles are difficult to conduct in a concentrated, systematic, and comprehensive manner, which is not conducive to the struggle and does not help to raise the consciousness of the masses.

Guildism can also lead the masses into the quagmire of economism. Those with guildist thoughts often prioritize the immediate and partial interests of workers in the same trade and profession, many of which are economic interests. Prioritizing immediate economic interests will inevitably lead to economism.

Currently, as the cultural revolution enters the new stage of implementing the "three-in-one" combination to seize power, the harm caused by guildism has become more pronounced. It hinders the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction and is not conducive to the development of the struggle to seize power; in units where power has been seized, it is not conducive to the proletarian revolutionary faction taking power and to promoting revolution and production.

Now, comrades who have participated in guild-like mass organizations have begun to recognize the harm of guildist thought and are taking action to eliminate its influence. Some of these organizations are voluntarily dissolving. This is very good. All revolutionary organizations should support those who have left such organizations and should not discriminate against them. However, there are still many members in these organizations who have not recognized the harm of guildism and have some unresolved issues.

Some say: "The capitalist reactionary line has oppressed and discriminated against us particularly deeply. Our actions to solve our special problems are revolutionary actions." Indeed, workers of different trades and professions have experienced different specific situations of persecution by the capitalist reactionary line. Workers of different trades and professions do have some special problems that need to be solved. However, these are partial issues. The guiding principle for the working class should be that partial interests serve the overall interests. Only when the overall problem is solved can the partial problem be resolved. Take this cultural revolution, for example. Only by implementing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and eliminating the influence of the capitalist reactionary line, can we make our proletarian state more secure. Only then can the partial and special problems of workers of different trades and professions be resolved. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must understand the principle of subordinating partial needs to overall needs." Every revolutionary comrade should follow Chairman Mao's teaching, correctly view the relationship between overall and partial interests, and must not put the cart before the horse.

Some say: "We form our own organizations based on profession and trade to achieve our own liberation." Indeed, the working class should liberate itself, and workers of different trades and professions should all participate in the revolution. Many workers who have joined such organizations have seen the shackles that the capitalist reactionary line has placed on them and urgently need to organize to break these shackles. This revolutionary demand is correct. However, they do not understand that self-liberation does not mean that workers of different trades and professions organize their forces to struggle separately. The strength of the working class lies in its organizational and collective nature. The working class always fights in unity. More than a hundred years ago, Marx called out: "Workers of the world, unite!" The bourgeoisie fears the unity of the working class the most and always tries every means to sabotage it. Guildism is a product of feudal society. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie takes up this junk and treats it as a treasure, using it as a tool to split the working class. We, the workers in a socialist society, must not let guildism poison us. Some comrades have been influenced by guildist thought in the past and have done things that are not conducive to the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The responsibility for this does not lie with the masses. We should blame this on the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. However, in the future, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly break with guildism. Only in this way can the working class achieve great unity, win the struggle to seize power, carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and complete the great task of liberating itself.

    同行会主义决裂
    《解放日报》三月十一日社论
    行会主义是一种不利于当前无产阶级革命派按产业、按系统、按单位、按部门实行大联合的带有封建主义色彩的思想。按照行会主义办事的人，他们不是从工人阶级和劳动人民的整体利益和长远利益出发来提出自己的斗争目标，不是按照阶级的区分来组织自己的队伍。他们按职业、按工种的区分来组织自己的队伍，并从本职业、本工种职工的局部利益和眼前利益出发来确定自己当前的斗争目标。这种行会主义思想，对当前无产阶级文化大革命的危害是很大的。
    行会主义分裂工人阶级的队伍。在一个单位里，不同工种、不同职业的职工，如果都各自成立自己的组织，各有各的斗争目标，这就会使得一个单位的职工队伍变得四分五裂，无法组成统一的强大的队伍。
    行会主义不利于对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争。按不同工种、不同职业组成的群众组织，他们有的虽然也对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，但他们往往是各按自己的系统和要求，分散地进行的。这样的揭发斗争，就很难做到集中、系统、全面，既不利于斗争，也不利于提高群众的觉悟。
    行会主义还会引导群众陷入经济主义的泥坑。具有行会主义思想的人，他们往往偏重于同工种、同职业职工的眼前利益和局部利益，而其中往往有很多是经济利益。把眼前的经济利益放在首位，必然要陷入经济主义泥坑。
    目前，在文化大革命进入实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权的新阶段后，行会主义的危害更突出了。它妨碍了无产阶级革命派的大联合，不利于夺权斗争的开展；在夺了权的单位，它也不利于无产阶级革命派的掌权，不利于抓革命，促生产。
    现在，参加过行会性质的群众组织的同志，有些已经认识到行会主义思想的危害，正在行动起来，消除这种思想的影响。有些这类组织还在自动酝酿解散。这些都是很好的。对于脱离了这种组织的群众，一切革命组织都应该支持他们，不能歧视他们。但是，这类组织中，也还有不少成员没有认识行会主义的危害，还存在一些想不通的问题。
    有的说：“资产阶级反动路线对我们的压迫和歧视特别深，我们要求解决我们特殊问题的行动是革命的行动。”的确，不同工种、不同职业的职工，所受到的资产阶级反动路线迫害的具体情况是有所不同的。不同工种、不同职业的职工确实存在着一些特殊的问题需要解决。但是，这些都是局部性的问题。工人阶级的行动准则应该是局部利益服从整体利益。只有整体的问题解决了，局部问题才能得到解决。以这次文化大革命来说，只有实行无产阶级革命派大联合，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打倒了，把资产阶级反动路线的影响肃清了，把我们的无产阶级江山搞得更巩固了，不同工种、不同职业的职工的局部性的、特殊性的问题才有可能得到解决。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。”我们每个革命同志都应遵照毛主席这一教导，正确看待全局利益与局部利益的关系，决不能本末倒置。
    有的说：“我们按职业、按工种成立自己的组织是为了实现自己解放自己。”不错，工人阶级应该自己解放自己，不同工种、不同职业的职工都应该起来参加革命。参加这类组织的许多职工群众，看到资产阶级反动路线所加在自己头上的束缚，迫切需要组织起来打破这种束缚，这种革命要求是正确的。但是，他们不懂得，自己解放自己，决不等于不同工种、不同职业的职工各自组织队伍分散地进行斗争。工人阶级之所以有力量，就在于它的组织性和集体性。工人阶级进行革命斗争，总是联合起来进行的。早在一百多年前，马克思就号召：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”资产阶级最害怕的是工人阶级的联合，总是千方百计地要破坏工人阶级的联合。行会主义本来是封建社会的产物，到了资本主义社会，资产阶级就拿起了行会主义这个破烂货，当作宝贝，用它来作为分裂工人阶级的工具。我们社会主义社会的工人，决不能再让行会主义来毒害我们。有些群众过去受了行会主义思想的影响，做了一些不利于无产阶级革命派大联合的事，其责任不在群众身上。我们应该把这笔账算在封建阶级和资产阶级身上。但是，今后我们必须以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底地和行会主义决裂。只有这样，工人阶级才能实现大联合，才能胜利进行夺权斗争，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能完成自己解放自己的伟大任务。
