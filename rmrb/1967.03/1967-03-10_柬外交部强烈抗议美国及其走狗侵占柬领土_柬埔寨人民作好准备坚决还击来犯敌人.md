The Cambodian Foreign Ministry strongly protests the U.S. and its puppets' occupation of Cambodian territory. The Cambodian people are prepared to resolutely counterattack the invading enemy.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh on March 8, the Cambodian News Agency reported on March 7 that the Royal Government of Cambodia, through the French Embassy in Phnom Penh, submitted a note to the U.S. government on March 5, strongly protesting the invasion of Cambodian territory by the U.S.-South Vietnamese-South Korean aggression forces.

The note stated that around 9:30 a.m. on February 24, a large number of invading forces composed of the U.S., South Vietnam, and South Korea entered Cambodian territory and launched a fierce attack on the village of Daung Rot in the district of Chumreah, Kampong Cham Province.

On the same day, around 12:45 p.m., U.S. aircraft heavily bombed the village of Chrak Lorn, near Daung Rot. Under the cover of artillery fire, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces, riding in about a dozen M-113 armored personnel carriers, invaded and set fire to the village. As of March 3, the Cambodian village of Chrak Lorn was still under the occupation of the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces, and the residents were forced to evacuate the village.

The note pointed out that the Royal Government strongly condemns the deliberate actions of the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces to destroy the territorial integrity of Cambodia and lodges the strongest protest.

The note stated: The Royal Government demands an immediate halt to the armed occupation of Chrak Lorn village in Cambodia.

The note emphasized: "The U.S. government and its Saigon puppet regime must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences that will arise from their continued barbaric actions and occupation of Cambodian territory by their troops."

On the morning of March 6, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry and the Information Ministry invited military attachés and press officers from foreign embassies in Cambodia, as well as foreign and Cambodian journalists, to investigate the situation in the district of Chumreah, Kampong Cham Province, where the enemy had been repelled. Colonel Sos Danith Fernande, commander of the First Military Region of Cambodia, briefed the investigators, saying that since February 23, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces had repeatedly bombed Cambodian villages and forward military positions with F-105 aircraft and artillery. More than 280 Cambodian civilians were forced to evacuate to the interior. Colonel Fernande showed the investigators 53 unexploded shells, on which were inscribed the English letters 105 and 155 millimeters. Colonel Fernande solemnly pointed out to the investigators that we have counterattacked the enemy forces that invaded our territory. He said, we are prepared, and if the enemy invades our territory again, we will resolutely counterattack.

According to another report by the Cambodian News Agency on March 8, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry, through the French Embassy in Phnom Penh, submitted a note to the U.S. government on February 25, strongly protesting the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet aircraft's bombing and strafing of Cambodian territory on January 3, 22, and 31.

    柬埔寨人民作好准备坚决还击来犯敌人
    据新华社金边八日电　据柬埔寨新闻社七日报道，柬埔寨王国政府外交部三月五日通过法国驻金边大使馆向美国政府提交了一份照会，最强烈地抗议美国—南越—南朝鲜组成的侵略军侵占柬埔寨领土。
    照会说，二月二十四日九点三十分左右，由美国、南越、南朝鲜组成的一大批侵略军队，侵入柬埔寨领土，并且向磅湛省棉末县的达翁罗特村猛烈开火。
    同一天将近十二点四十五分时，美国飞机猛烈轰炸了达翁罗特村邻近的茨拉克兰村。在炮火掩护下，美国—南越伪军乘坐了十来辆M—113型装甲车侵入、并放火烧毁了这个村庄。直到三月三日，柬埔寨的茨拉克兰村还在美国—南越伪军的占领下，居民被迫迁离这个村庄。
    照会指出，王国政府对于美国—南越伪军蓄意破坏柬埔寨领土完整的行动表示极大愤慨，并提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：王国政府要求立即停止对柬埔寨的茨拉克兰村的武装占领。
    照会强调指出：“美国政府及其西贡走狗政权，必须对由于它们的军队继续采取这种野蛮行动和继续占领柬埔寨领土所将产生的严重后果负全部责任。”
    六日上午，柬埔寨外交部和新闻部邀请驻柬埔寨的外国使馆的武官和新闻专员、外国和柬埔寨记者等，到已把敌人击退的磅湛省棉末县进行调查。柬埔寨第一军区司令索斯丹尼·费尔南德中校向调查人员介绍情况说，自从二月二十三日以来，美国—南越伪军一再用F—105型飞机轰炸并用大炮轰击柬埔寨的村庄和前沿军事阵地。二百八十多名柬埔寨平民被迫迁往内地。费尔南德中校让调查人员察看了五十三枚没有爆炸的炮弹，在炮弹上刻有一○五和一五五毫米英文字样。费尔南德中校向调查人员郑重指出，我们对侵入我国领土的敌军进行了还击。他说，我们已经作好准备，如果敌人再侵犯我国领土，我们就坚决予以还击。
    另据柬埔寨新闻社八日报道，柬埔寨外交部二月二十五日通过法国驻金边大使馆向美国政府提交了照会，强烈抗议美国—南越伪军的飞机一月三日、二十二日、三十一日侵入柬埔寨领空轰炸和扫射柬埔寨领土。
