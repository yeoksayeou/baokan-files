The U.S. imperialist running dog, the Indonesian right-wing military regime, has recently intensified its betrayal of Indonesian national interests to the imperialists led by the United States, allowing them to plunder Indonesia's resources and exploit the Indonesian people.

The Indonesian right-wing military regime announced on the 17th that it would grant various tax exemptions to foreign companies and joint ventures with Indonesian companies. These so-called joint ventures are actually under the control of foreign monopolies. An Indonesian senior official said that these enterprises can be exempted from corporate tax and dividend tax for a period of up to five years. This is another crime of selling out national interests by the Indonesian right-wing military regime after passing the "Foreign Investment Ordinance" and signing an agreement guaranteeing the safety of U.S. monopoly capital investments.

According to recent reports from Western news agencies, four foreign oil companies will begin oil exploration in the coastal areas of Java and Kalimantan with the Indonesian oil company in April.

The reckless treasonous policies of the Indonesian reactionaries have delighted the bloodsuckers from the United States, Japan, and other countries. According to a report by the Antara News Agency on the 15th, "After the Indonesian parliament recently passed the 'Foreign Investment Ordinance,' foreign investors have shown great interest in investing in Indonesia."

The personal advisor to the Indonesian right-wing military regime's minister of heavy industry, light industry, and handicrafts, Budi Rahmat, said at a press conference on the 14th that some foreign investors have already held in-depth discussions with the heavy industry, light industry, and handicrafts departments on investment issues in Indonesia. American, Japanese, and French investors have expressed interest in building the Sriwijaya fertilizer plant in Palembang, South Sumatra. The United States, France, and Belgium have proposed building large-scale aircraft repair factories in Indonesia. The Dutch Philips Electric Company has proposed a joint venture with Indonesia to build a light bulb factory. Meanwhile, investors from the United States, France, and Italy have proposed establishing automated factories.

At the beginning of this year, the Indonesian reactionaries ordered the return of four American oil companies, which were previously nationalized by the Indonesian government under strong public demand, back to U.S. imperialism. Recently, it has continued to return other foreign enterprises, which were previously nationalized by the previous government, to those foreign monopoly capitalists who have long exploited and oppressed the Indonesian people.

    肆意出卖民族利益
    印尼反动派为帝国主义资本敞开大门
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义的走狗印度尼西亚右派军人政权，最近变本加厉地把印度尼西亚的民族利益出卖给以美国为首的帝国主义，让它们掠夺印尼的资源，剥削印尼人民。
    印尼右派军人政权十七日宣布，它将给外国公司和印尼公司合资经营的企业以多种免税待遇。这种所谓合营企业实际上是在外国垄断资本控制之下的。一名印尼高级官员说，这种企业可以在长达五年的期限内免缴公司税和红利税。这是印尼右派军人政权继通过“外国投资法令”，并且签订保证美国垄断资本投资安全的卖国协定后，又一个出卖民族利益的罪行。
    据西方通讯社最近报道，四家外国石油公司将于四月份同印尼石油公司一起，在爪哇岛和加里曼丹沿海勘探石油。
    印尼反动派这种放肆的卖国政策，使美国、日本等国家的吸血鬼大为高兴。据安塔拉通讯社十五日报道：“在（印尼）国会最近通过‘外国投资法令’以后，外国投资者对在印尼进行投资表现了很大的兴趣。”
    印尼右派军人政权的重工业、轻工业和手工业部长的私人顾问布迪·拉赫马特十四日在记者招待会上说，一些外国投资者已经同重工业、轻工业和手工业部门就在印尼投资问题举行了深入的会谈。美国、日本和法国的投资者对于在南苏门答腊巨港修建斯里维查亚肥料厂表示有兴趣。美国、法国、比利时还提议在印尼建设规模宏大的飞机修配厂。荷兰菲利普斯电气公司已经提议同印尼
  “合营”电灯泡工厂。而美国、法国和意大利的投资者则建议设立自动化工厂。
    印尼反动派今年年初曾经下令把前印尼政府在人民的强烈要求下实行管制的四家美国石油公司，交还给美帝国主义。最近，它继续把前政府管制的其他一些外国企业，交还给那些长期剥削和压榨印尼人民血汗的外国垄断资本家。
