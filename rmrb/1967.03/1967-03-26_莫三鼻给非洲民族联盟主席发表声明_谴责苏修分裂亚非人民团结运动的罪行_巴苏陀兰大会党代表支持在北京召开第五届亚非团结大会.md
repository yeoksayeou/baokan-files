Mozambique Liberation Front Chairman Mlasa issued a statement here on March 22 to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, saying: "The Mozambique Liberation Front strongly condemns the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys for forcibly convening an illegal and deceptive so-called 'Eighth Council Meeting of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization' in Nicosia, attempting to split the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement in support of imperialist reactionary actions."

He said: "The Soviet revisionists have sabotaged the resolution passed at the Winnipeg Conference regarding the holding of the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing, thus once again exposing their disregard for the interests of the Afro-Asian peoples and their policy of supporting U.S. imperialism in splitting and destroying Afro-Asian solidarity. The criminal actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership in splitting the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization are part of their overall policy of serving U.S. imperialism and reactionary forces, aiming to split the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and other Afro-Asian organizations, and to sabotage the unity of the Afro-Asian peoples in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and reactionary forces."

Mlasa pointed out that the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference should be held in Beijing, the capital of the great center of the world's revolutionary peoples, the People's Republic of China. He said: "The revisionists and their accomplices fear the holding of the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing because they know it will lead to brilliant victories for the Afro-Asian peoples in their struggle against colonialism, imperialism, and reactionary forces. This is obviously the reason for their attempt to sabotage it."

He said: "The running dogs and lackeys of U.S. imperialism will continue to sabotage the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the Afro-Asian countries, but they will inevitably fail. As the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao Zedong, has pointed out: 'Create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail more, until they perish—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic.'"

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Cairo, Botswana Democratic Party representative Maphanyane issued a statement on March 23 here, reaffirming support for the resolution of the Winnipeg Conference on holding the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year, and warmly welcoming the establishment of the Preparatory Committee in China.

The statement expressed support for the declaration issued by the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee on March 17. It said: "We praise the steps taken by the Chinese people and wholeheartedly support the Preparatory Committee, wishing it success in its noble work of preparing for the Fifth Conference."

The statement said: "Revolutionaries of the two continents now look forward with confidence to future victories in the struggle."

The statement also condemned the illegal Eighth Council Meeting of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization convened by the Soviet revisionists in Nicosia in February and their crimes of splitting the Afro-Asian people's anti-imperialist solidarity movement. The statement said: "The Soviet revisionists have exposed their consistent policy of sabotaging the national liberation movements of the Afro-Asian peoples and acting as the number one lackey of U.S. imperialism." The statement said that the revolutionary forces of the two continents are determined to achieve new victories in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, until Asia and Africa achieve true independence and humanity achieves freedom.

    莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟主席发表声明
    谴责苏修分裂亚非人民团结运动的罪行
    巴苏陀兰大会党代表支持在北京召开第五届亚非团结大会
    新华社喀土穆电　莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟主席米拉斯二十二日在这里对新华社记者发表谈话说：“莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟强烈谴责苏联修正主义者及其走狗在尼科西亚强行召开非法的、欺骗性的所谓亚非人民团结组织‘第八届理事会会议’，企图分裂亚非人民团结运动的支持帝国主义的反动行动。”
    他说：“苏联修正主义者破坏温尼巴大会通过的关于第五届亚非人民团结大会在北京举行的决议，从而再一次暴露了他们多么无视亚非人民的利益，暴露了他们在推行美帝国主义的分裂和破坏亚非团结的政策。苏修领导集团分裂亚非人民团结组织的罪恶行动，是他们企图进一步为美帝国主义和反动派效劳，分裂亚非作家常设局和其他亚非组织，推行破坏亚非人民在反对美帝国主义和反动派的斗争中的团结的总政策。”
    米拉斯指出，第五届亚非人民团结大会应当在全世界革命人民伟大的中心中华人民共和国的首都北京举行。他说：“修正主义者及其帮凶害怕第五届亚非人民团结大会在北京举行，是因为他们知道这将导致亚非人民在反对殖民主义、帝国主义和反动派的斗争中取得辉煌的胜利。这显然是他们企图进行破坏的原因。”
    他说：美帝国主义的帮凶和走狗会继续对亚非各国人民的革命事业进行破坏，但是他们必将失败。正如世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    据新华社开罗电　巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代表马帕法尼二十三日在这里发表声明，重申支持温尼巴大会关于今年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议，并且热烈欢呼中国筹备委员会的成立。
    声明表示支持中国亚非团结委员会三月十七日的声明。它说：“我们赞扬中国人民采取的步骤，衷心支持筹备委员会，祝它筹备第五届大会的崇高工作获得成功。”
    声明说：“两大洲的革命者现在满怀信心地期望着未来的斗争胜利。”
    声明还谴责苏联修正主义者二月间在尼科西亚强行非法召开的第八届亚非团结理事会会议和他们分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪行。声明说：“苏修暴露了他们一贯推行破坏亚非人民民族解放运动和充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的政策。”声明说，亚非两大洲的革命力量决心在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中取得新的胜利，直到亚洲和非洲赢得真正的独立，直到人类取得自由。
