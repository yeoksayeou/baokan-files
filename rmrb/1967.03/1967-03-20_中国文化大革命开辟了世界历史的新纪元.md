The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is not only a great revolution that concerns the destiny and future of China but also a great revolution that concerns the destiny and future of the world revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great revolution carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. This unprecedented event in history is shaking the entire world.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is Comrade Mao Zedong's great contribution and great innovation to Marxism-Leninism and the international communist movement.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding in the center of the world revolution—China—is, like Lenin's October Revolution that opened the road to socialism, opening the road to communism for the proletariat of the whole world. Therefore, I believe that the road indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong is a road that all revolutionary peoples of the world who want to advance toward communism must take.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops, I have gradually deepened my understanding of its great international significance.

Since this year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new and important stage of struggle for power.

However, in my thinking, I have not correctly linked the Cultural Revolution with the struggle for power.

I once had the following question: China, under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, is a powerful country of proletarian dictatorship. Why is it necessary to seize power? What exactly is the seizure of power in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution?

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the proletariat and people of China seized power nationwide in 1949. Except for Taiwan Province, all of China was liberated, and a state of proletarian dictatorship was established. This was the victory of the people's democratic revolution and a great victory for China's advance toward socialism. The victory of the Chinese revolution became a decisive factor in fundamentally changing the balance of class forces in the world. The great thought of Mao Zedong became a powerful ideological weapon for the people of the world to wage revolutionary struggles, defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and socialist China became a bastion of the world proletarian revolution.

As Comrade Mao Zedong taught, the victory of the Chinese people is only "the first step in a journey of ten thousand miles." The road ahead is longer, the work is more arduous, and it is also more magnificent.

Comrade Mao Zedong also taught that in socialist society, classes, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist, and the overthrown exploiting classes will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. Through the Cultural Revolution, I have gradually deepened my understanding of this point.

Class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in society will inevitably be reflected within the Party. The overthrown exploiting classes first launch a ferocious attack on the proletariat in the ideological realm and seek their agents within the Party to sabotage the Party from within, turning the proletarian party into a bourgeois party and the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship, and restoring capitalism from socialism.

A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, under their long-term control in certain departments, organs, and enterprises, practice bourgeois dictatorship. If the Cultural Revolution is not carried out and allowed to develop, then, as Chairman Mao pointed out, in a few years or a decade, or even a few decades, the whole of China would change color.

Lenin's October Revolution was a great revolution. It opened the road to liberation and socialism for the world proletariat. China and other socialist countries also took the road of the October Revolution to achieve liberation. However, in the Soviet Union, no revolution was carried out in the ideological realm after the October Revolution. Therefore, Khrushchev revisionism emerged in the Soviet Union, and socialist Soviet Union became a revisionist country.

This serious lesson in the international communist movement has posed a question before all Marxist-Leninists in the world: how to prevent the degeneration of socialism and how to realize communism.

Who solved this problem? It was the great Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong summed up the experiences and lessons of China and the international situation and, with great revolutionary daring and determination, launched this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong has solved the urgent problems both at home and abroad in theory and practice. Only a great Marxist-Leninist like Comrade Mao Zedong, only a great leader with rich experience in struggle like Comrade Mao Zedong, could achieve this.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power and the consolidation of power." The central issue of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the seizure of power, that is, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This is not a top-down dismissal and reorganization but a mass movement from the bottom up, a combination of revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres, and responsible persons of the People's Liberation Army to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. In fact, it is the proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie. We believe that only in this way can the proletariat firmly grasp power in every department and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. Only in this way can the degeneration of socialism be prevented.

This issue of seizing power under the proletarian dictatorship is a new and great development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

In the Cultural Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed the experience of the Paris Commune. Marx summed up the experience of the Paris Commune and pointed out that the proletariat must not inherit the ready-made state machine of the bourgeoisie. For the institutions usurped by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, it is necessary to smash them thoroughly according to this principle of Marxism, and not to use reformist methods. Only in this way can all the old superstructures that do not correspond to the socialist economic base be transformed. Only in this way can conditions be created to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois individualism thought produced on the basis of private ownership and establish communist thought based on public ownership—Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only seizes power from the power-holders taking the capitalist road but also wages a struggle to seize power from bourgeois thought in one's own mind, which is a profound revolution to smash bourgeois thought and establish Mao Zedong Thought. In other words, it tells us that while we regard ourselves as the driving force of the revolution, we must also regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. Only in this way can the ideological foundation of revisionism be uprooted, the achievements of the Cultural Revolution be consolidated, and the guarantee be provided that socialist China will never change color and that the socialist revolution will be carried through to the end.

The Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong has indeed opened a new era in the history of the world proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly enriched and developed the experience of the Paris Commune and the Soviets, and enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism.

Through China's Cultural Revolution, Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world have seen the road they should take. For this reason, they have spared no effort to support and praise China's Cultural Revolution.

The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has had a significant impact in Japan. First, the revolutionary people of Japan have recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is the only ideological weapon to overthrow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and achieve their own liberation, and they have become more eager to study the works of Mao Zedong. For example, during the Cultural Revolution, the "Little Red Book" of Chairman Mao's quotations carried by the Red Guards has become a precious book for the Japanese people to wage revolutionary struggles. In a few months, 300,000 copies of the "Little Red Book" were sold. Second, the revolutionary people of Japan, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the Red Guards, not only fight against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries but also firmly fight against the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. Third, the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the Japanese people realize that only the road indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the road of the Chinese revolution, is the road to communism. It has shown the Japanese revolutionary people their bright future and strengthened their fighting spirit.

The broad masses of the Japanese people, like the revolutionary masses of the world, sincerely hope for friendship with the Chinese people and regard the Cultural Revolution as their own cause, expressing great concern and support for it.

On the contrary, imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, through China's Cultural Revolution, have seen that they are facing a dead end. For this reason, they frantically attack and distort the Cultural Revolution.

The Soviet revisionist leadership and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists are exactly the same. The Soviet revisionists frantically distort and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. The Japanese Communist Party revisionists also launched a named attack on Chairman Mao in the unsigned articles published in the "Akahata" newspaper on January 24 and February 9, openly distorting and attacking the Cultural Revolution.

What does the attack by the reactionaries of the world on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mean? It means that due to the Cultural Revolution, the reactionaries' plot to make the world revolution fail through the "peaceful evolution" of China and the degeneration of the center of the world revolution—China—has suffered a miserable failure.

Their frenzied attacks only indicate that they are facing a dead end.

We, the revolutionary leftists of Japan, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people, and fight with full confidence for the final victory of the Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader of the world's people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    中国文化大革命开辟了世界历史的新纪元
    日本　井出润一郎
    毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅是关系到中国的命运和前途的大革命，而且也是关系到世界革命的命运和前途的大革命。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命是在无产阶级专政的条件下进行的大革命。这个大革命，是史无前例的重大事件，它震撼着全世界。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义和国际共产主义运动的伟大贡献和伟大创举。
    在世界革命的中心——中国展开的文化大革命，同列宁在十月革命所开辟的社会主义道路一样，是为全世界无产阶级开辟了走向共产主义的道路。因此，我相信毛泽东同志所指引的这条道路，对于世界上任何要走向共产主义的革命人民来说，都是必经的道路。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的发展，我也逐步地提高了对它的伟大的国际意义的认识。
    今年以来，无产阶级文化大革命进入了夺权斗争的新的重要阶段。
    但是，我在思想上，一直没有把文化大革命和夺权斗争正确地联系起来。
    我曾经有过这样一个疑问：中国是在伟大的领袖毛泽东同志领导下的强大的无产阶级专政的国家，为什么还必须夺权呢？在无产阶级文化大革命中的夺权究竟是怎么回事呢？
    毛泽东同志和中国共产党所领导的中国的无产阶级和人民，一九四九年在全国范围内夺取了政权。除了台湾省以外，全中国都解放了，并建立了无产阶级专政的国家。这是人民民主革命的胜利，是中国走上社会主义道路的伟大胜利。中国革命的胜利，成为从根本上改变全世界阶级力量对比的决定性的因素。伟大的毛泽东思想，成为全世界人民进行革命斗争，战胜帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器，社会主义的中国成为世界无产阶级革命的堡垒。
    正如毛泽东同志所教导的那样，中国人民的这个胜利也只是“万里长征走完了第一步”。以后的路程更长，工作更艰苦，也更伟大。
    毛泽东同志还教导说，社会主义社会，仍然存在阶级，存在阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，同时，被推翻了的剥削阶级是决不甘心自己失败的。这一点，我通过文化大革命逐步加深了认识。
    社会上的阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争必然要反映到党内来。被推翻了的剥削阶级，首先从思想意识领域开始对无产阶级进行猖狂的进攻，同时，他们在党内寻找自己的代理人，企图从内部破坏党，使无产阶级政党蜕化为资产阶级政党，使无产阶级专政蜕化为资产阶级专政，使社会主义复辟为资本主义。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在他们长期控制的某些部门、机关和企业里实行资产阶级专政。如果不进行文化大革命，任其发展下去，那么，就会象毛主席所指出的那样，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，整个中国就要改变颜色了。
    列宁所领导的十月革命，是一次伟大的革命。它为世界无产阶级开辟了解放的道路、社会主义的道路。中国和其他社会主义国家，也都是走十月革命的道路，取得了解放的。但是，在苏联，十月革命后没有进行思想意识领域内的革命。所以，在苏联产生了赫鲁晓夫修正主义，社会主义的苏联变成了修正主义国家。
    国际共产主义运动中的这一严重教训，在全世界马克思列宁主义者面前提出了一个问题，即如何防止社会主义变质，怎样实现共产主义。
    谁解决了这个问题呢？那就是伟大的毛泽东同志。毛泽东同志总结了中国和国际的经验教训，并且以伟大的革命气魄和极大的决心发动了这场无产阶级文化大革命。毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的这场文化大革命，在理论上和实践上解决了国内外都迫切需要解决的问题。只有象毛泽东同志这样伟大的马克思列宁主义者，象毛泽东同志这样有丰富的斗争经验的伟大领袖，才能做到这一点。
    毛泽东同志教导说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”无产阶级文化大革命的中心问题，就是夺权，也就是无产阶级革命派联合起来，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的手里夺权。这不是自上而下的撤职和改组，而是放手发动群众，自下而上的群众运动，是革命群众、革命领导干部和解放军负责人三者结合起来，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的手里夺权的斗争。实际上，就是无产阶级夺资产阶级的权。我们认为，只有这样，无产阶级才能在各个部门都牢牢地掌握权力，才能巩固无产阶级专政。这样，才能防止社会主义蜕化变质。
    这种在无产阶级专政下进行夺权的问题，是对马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的一个新的巨大发展。
    毛泽东同志在文化大革命中，创造性地发展了巴黎公社的经验。马克思总结了巴黎公社的经验，指出无产阶级决不能继承资产阶级的现成的国家机器。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所篡夺的机构，决不能用改良主义的办法，而必须根据马克思主义的这条原则，彻底打碎。只有这样才能变革一切旧的、不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。这样，才能创造条件，彻底消灭在私有制基础上产生的资产阶级个人主义思想，树立以公有制为基础的共产主义思想——毛泽东思想。
    无产阶级文化大革命，不仅要从走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权，而且也要在自己的头脑中展开无产阶级思想向资产阶级思想的夺权斗争，这是一场粉碎资产阶级思想，树立毛泽东思想的深刻的革命。也就是说，它告诉我们在把自己当做革命的动力的同时，也要把自己当作革命的对象。这样，才能挖掉修正主义的思想基础，巩固文化大革命的成果，保证社会主义中国永不变色，保证把社会主义革命进行到底。
    毛泽东同志所领导的文化大革命，确实为世界无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史开辟了一个新纪元。这场无产阶级文化大革命，大大地丰富并发展了巴黎公社的经验和苏维埃的经验，丰富并发展了马克思列宁主义。
    全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民通过中国的文化大革命，看到了自己所应该走的道路，正因为是这样，他们才竭尽全力支持和赞扬中国的文化大革命。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，在日本起了很大的影响。第一，日本的革命人民认识到毛泽东思想是打倒美日反动派、解放自己的唯一的思想武器，从而更加迫切地要求学习毛泽东著作。例如，在文化大革命中，红卫兵贴身带的《毛主席语录》，在日本人民中已成为进行革命斗争的宝书。在几个月之内，《毛主席语录》就销售了三十万册。第二，日本的革命人民，因受到红卫兵小将们的革命造反精神的鼓舞，不仅同美帝国主义和日本反动派进行斗争，而且也在坚决地同日共修正主义分子进行斗争。第三，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，使日本人民认识到只有毛泽东同志所指出的道路、中国革命的道路，才是走向共产主义的道路。它使日本的革命人民看到了自己的光明前途，增强了斗争信心。
    日本的广大群众，同全世界的革命群众一样，都衷心地希望同中国人民友好，并把文化大革命当作自己的事业，而表示给予极大的关心和支持。
    与此相反，以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，通过中国的文化大革命，看到自己已面临穷途末路。正因为这样，他们拚命地攻击和歪曲文化大革命。
    苏修领导集团同日共修正主义分子，是完全一样的。苏修拚命歪曲和破坏文化大革命。日共修正主义分子，也在一月二十四日和二月九日等几天的《赤旗报》刊登的不署名文章上，展开了对毛主席的指名攻击，公开歪曲和攻击文化大革命。
    世界上的反动派，攻击无产阶级文化大革命说明了什么？这意味着由于文化大革命，已使反动派企图通过中国的“和平演变”和这个世界革命的中心——中国的变质，使世界革命归于失败的阴谋遭到悲惨的失败。
    他们的疯狂的攻击，只表明他们已面临穷途末路。
    我们日本的革命左派，将高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同中国人民肩并肩，满怀信心地为文化大革命的最后胜利而斗争！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！万岁！万万岁！
