Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Condemns U.S. and Soviet Attempts to Extinguish the Vietnamese People's Anti-American National Salvation Struggle

French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) Secretary Exposes Khrushchev's Betrayal During His Visit to Britain

Tirana, March 26 — The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on March 26, severely condemning the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists for their conspiracy of "bombing and pressuring" aimed at extinguishing the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle.

The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist ruling clique are collaborating on the Vietnam issue, jointly pursuing a policy of "carrot and stick." The U.S. imperialists continue to savagely bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and expand their aggression against the people of South Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, on the other hand, is increasing pressure on the Vietnamese people, attempting to force them into negotiations with the U.S. aggressors. Following Khrushchev's visit to London, all the revisionist newspapers are clamoring for the cessation of bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a condition for so-called "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue. It is clear that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's shameless conspiracy is a dagger in the back of the Vietnamese people.

The commentary emphasized that the only condition for solving the Vietnam problem is to drive all U.S. aggressors and their puppet troops out of Vietnamese territory.

The U.S. imperialists shamelessly demand that the people of North Vietnam abandon their support for their compatriots in the South and urge the people of South Vietnam to stop their anti-American national salvation struggle in exchange for a halt to the bombing. This is utterly shameless! The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's support for the U.S. imperialists' shameless blackmail shows to what extent this bunch of despicable traitors has degenerated.

The commentary concluded by saying that the U.S. aggressors' savage bombing has not and will not intimidate the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people will not allow anyone to manipulate their fate; they will continue to deliver devastating blows to the U.S. aggressors and carry the anti-American national salvation struggle to final victory.

Paris, March 26 — François Marti, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist), published an article in the March 23 issue of "Nouvel Humanité," condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership for acting as brokers for the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" fraud and betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people.

The article, discussing Khrushchev's activities during his visit to Britain in support of the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" fraud, pointed out that Khrushchev's actions "once again show that he is acting as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism."

The article refuted Khrushchev's attempts to whitewash Johnson, claiming that Johnson has "good intentions" and has taken a "step towards peace," and pointed out that this is the logic of Khrushchev revisionism in its purest form. The article said that Khrushchev is a traitor to the Vietnamese people's sacred struggle for national salvation, betraying the cause of liberation for the oppressed peoples and nations.

Marti concluded: "For us communists who are loyal to proletarian internationalism, it is our duty to expose this fraud, conspiracy, and betrayal."

    解决越南问题的条件只能是美军滚出去
    阿《团结报》谴责美苏妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争烈火
    法国共产主义运动（马列）书记揭露柯西金访英的叛卖行径
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十六日发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义玩弄“以炸压和”的大阴谋，妄图扑灭越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    评论说，美帝国主义者和苏修统治集团在越南问题上互相配合，共同推行“大棒和胡萝卜”的政策。美帝国主义者继续野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国，扩大对越南南方人民的侵略战争。苏修统治集团则加紧对越南人民施加压力，企图迫使越南人民同美国侵略者进行谈判。继柯西金访问伦敦之后，修正主义者的所有报纸一齐大肆叫嚷，要求把停止轰炸越南民主共和国作为所谓在越南问题上开始“和谈”的条件。十分清楚，苏修统治集团的这个无耻阴谋是插在越南人民背后的一把尖刀。
    评论强调指出，解决越南问题的条件只能是把所有美国侵略者及其仆从军队从越南土地上赶出去。
    美帝国主义者公然无理要求越南北方人民放弃支援自己的南方骨肉同胞并促使越南南方人民停止抗美救国斗争，作为停炸的交换条件。这简直是无耻之极！而苏修统治集团支持美帝国主义的这种无耻讹诈，说明这伙卑鄙无耻的叛徒已经堕落到了何等地步。
    评论最后说，美国侵略者的野蛮轰炸过去没有吓倒、现在也不会吓倒越南人民。越南人民绝不会让任何人玩弄自己的命运，他们必将继续给美国侵略者以毁灭性的打击，把抗美救国斗争进行到最后胜利。
    新华社巴黎二十六日电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会书记处书记弗朗索瓦·马尔蒂在二十三日出版的《新人道报》上发表文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团充当美帝国主义策划“和谈”骗局的掮客，出卖越南人民的利益。
    文章在谈到柯西金访英期间为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳时指出，柯西金的活动“再一次表明他充当了美帝国主义的帮凶”。
    文章驳斥了柯西金为约翰逊涂脂抹粉、说约翰逊具有“诚意”、向“和谈”“迈出了一步”的论调，并且指出，这是不折不扣的赫鲁晓夫修正主义的逻辑。文章说，柯西金是越南人民抗美救国神圣事业的叛徒，他出卖了被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放事业。
    马尔蒂最后写道：“对于我们忠于无产阶级国际主义的共产党人来说，揭穿这种骗局、阴谋和叛卖，就是我们的义务。”
