The majority of cadres at all levels of the rural people's communes are good or relatively good. Comrades who have made mistakes should strive to make amends during the spring plowing and production. As long as cadres who have made mistakes do this, the poor and lower-middle peasants should understand and support them in their work.

    农村人民公社各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。犯过错误的同志，也应该努力在春耕生产中将功补过。犯过错误的干部只要这样做，贫下中农就应该谅解他们，支持他们工作。
