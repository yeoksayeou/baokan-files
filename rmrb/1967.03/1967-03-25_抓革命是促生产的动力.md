Revolution is the driving force for production

The fact that the Xinwen Mining Bureau's production has risen across the board once again forcefully proves that only by focusing on the revolution and promoting the ideological transformation of the people can production be greatly promoted.

For a long time, the biggest obstacle preventing the broad masses of workers in industrial and mining enterprises from fully exerting their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity has been a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was precisely these few people who engaged in economism, inciting some masses to leave their production posts, attempting to sabotage the cultural revolution and production. When the revolutionary masses foiled their plots and production was on the rise, they maliciously distorted the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, stirring up a tide of capitalist restoration.

In this sharp and complex class struggle, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Xinwen Mining Bureau, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, firmly carried out the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy. They believed in and relied on the broad revolutionary masses, believed in and relied on the People's Liberation Army, and believed in and relied on the majority of revolutionary cadres. They achieved revolutionary great unity, concentrating their efforts to strike down the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. In the struggle, they strove to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and all work.

Revolutionary workers should, like the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Xinwen Mining Bureau, at any time and under any circumstances, insist on putting the revolution first, using the revolution to drive production and guide production. Only in this way can our industrial and mining enterprises adhere to the socialist direction and serve the broad masses of laboring people.

    抓革命是促生产的动力
    新汶矿务局生产全面上升的事实，再一次有力地证明，只有抓好革命，促进人的思想革命化，才能大大促进生产的发展。
    长期以来，在工矿企业中，影响广大职工充分发挥革命积极性和创造性的最大障碍，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在无产阶级文化大革命中，正是这一小撮人，大搞经济主义，煽动一些群众离开生产岗位，妄图破坏文化革命，破坏生产。当革命群众粉碎了他们的阴谋，生产正在蒸蒸日上的时候，他们又恶毒地歪曲革命的“三结合”方针，掀起一股资本主义复辟的逆流。
    在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，新汶矿务局的无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席的教导，坚决执行革命的“三结合”方针，相信和依靠广大革命群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠大多数革命干部，实现革命的大联合，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。他们在斗争中努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来统帅生产，统帅一切工作。
    革命的职工，要象新汶矿务局无产阶级革命派那样，在任何时候，任何情况下，都要坚持把革命放在首位，以革命带动生产，统帅生产。只有如此，我们的工矿企业才能坚持社会主义方向，为广大劳动人民服务。
