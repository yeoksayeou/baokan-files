The Black Dragon River Military District recently issued a notice calling on all provincial militia to resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to be revolutionary elements of the proletariat, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The full text of the notice is as follows:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the country has entered a new stage. The revolutionary elements of the proletariat in Black Dragon River Province have responded most resolutely to the battle call of the great leader Chairman Mao, forming a vast revolutionary army. They have seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that had been held by a small clique of those in power who were taking the capitalist road within the provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee. The temporary highest power organ of the province—the Black Dragon River Provincial Revolutionary Committee—has been born, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the province has begun a great historical turn.

However, in this excellent revolutionary situation, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." The same is true of the small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road. They are playing tricks, spreading rumors, and making desperate struggles. They are colluding with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to form counter-revolutionary alliances, create chaos, instigate armed struggles, attack revolutionary elements, sabotage the great alliance of revolutionaries, and shift the direction of the struggle. There are also some people with ulterior motives who say, "The militia is no longer needed." We must keep our eyes open, heighten our vigilance, and thoroughly smash the plots and tricks of the class enemies who are trying to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The militia is a tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat and a powerful assistant and reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. Black Dragon River Province is an important industrial and agricultural production base in our country and a frontline in defending against the attacks of modern revisionism and the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan. The militia in the entire province bears the heavy responsibility of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strengthening national defense. At present, in the struggle of the revolutionary elements of the proletariat to seize power from the small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the militia must resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We call on all provincial militia:

1. Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao, and follow the Party Central Committee. In the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" as your guiding principles, and seriously study the important editorials and articles in the journals *Red Flag*, *People's Daily*, and *PLA Daily*. Carry out and implement the notices and appeals of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Arm your minds with Mao Zedong Thought, raise your understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the essence of the struggle between the two lines. In the struggle to seize power, thoroughly criticize the "self" and carry out a revolution in the depths of the soul. Overcome the bad tendencies of individualism, sectarianism, anarchism, and liberalism, and uphold the "public" spirit to strive to be revolutionary elements of the proletariat.

2. Resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary elements of the proletariat. Our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the left is also a battle call for the militia. In the struggle, the broad militia must use the method of class analysis to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, stand firmly, and most resolutely and bravely participate in and support the revolutionary elements. Direct the struggle against the small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly carry out the struggle to seize power. Militia who have been deceived and misled should quickly awaken, recognize the correct direction, and launch a fierce counterattack. Together with the revolutionary elements, unite against the enemy and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

3. Warmly support, resolutely obey, and bravely defend the temporary highest power organ of the province—the Black Dragon River Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The attitude towards this temporary highest power organ is the attitude towards the proletarian revolution. Whoever opposes it is opposing the revolution; whoever opposes it must be fought to the end.

4. Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production" and "save money to make the revolution," and bravely shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly guard your production posts and thoroughly expose the various plots and tricks of the class enemies. Militia who have gone out to link up should quickly return to their local areas and units to make the revolution on the spot. At present, the busy season for spring plowing in the countryside has arrived. Rural militia should take immediate action, intensify the revolution, and vigorously promote production, setting an example in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

5. Resolutely shoulder the glorious task of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the movement, the militia must correctly handle the two different types of contradictions. For those who are clearly proven to be current counter-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary organizations engaging in murder, arson, poisoning, sabotage, and stealing state secrets, actively cooperate with the public security organs to suppress them resolutely. For landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, implement the dictatorship, allow them to behave properly, and do not allow them to talk or act recklessly. If they do, deal with them severely according to law. For contradictions within the people, do not use the militia. Prevent class enemies from inciting and using the militia to suppress revolutionary masses. The leadership of the militia must be in the hands of the revolutionary elements of the proletariat and serve the proletariat.

All levels of the people's armed forces and the broad militia, let us, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight down and expose the small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, sweep away all monsters and demons, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman, and great teacher Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    黑龙江省军区向全省民兵发出号召
    紧跟毛主席　争当革命派
    掌握民兵领导权，巩固无产阶级专政，狠抓革命，猛促生产
    新华社哈尔滨七日电　中国人民解放军黑龙江省军区最近发出通告，号召全省民兵坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，做无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。通告全文如下：
    全国无产阶级文化大革命跨进了一个崭新阶段。黑龙江省无产阶级革命派，最坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号召，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持的党、政、财、文大权夺回来了，全省临时最高权力机构——黑龙江省革命委员会诞生了，全省无产阶级文化大革命开始了伟大的历史转折。
    但是，在这大好革命形势下，我们更要牢记毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”现在，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派也正是这样。他们耍阴谋，煽阴风，作垂死的挣扎。他们同地、富、反、坏、右分子纠合在一起，搞反革命的联合，制造混乱，挑起武斗，打击革命派，破坏革命大联合，转移斗争的大方向。还有些别有用心的人，胡说什么“民兵没有用了”。我们要擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，彻底粉碎阶级敌人破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋诡计。
    民兵，是无产阶级专政的工具，是人民解放军的有力助手和强大的后备力量。黑龙江省是我国重要的工农业生产基地，是我国防御现代修正主义和美日反动派进攻的前哨。全省民兵担负着保卫无产阶级文化大革命，巩固无产阶级专政，加强国防的重大责任。当前，在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，民兵要坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们号召全省民兵：
    一、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席，紧跟党中央。在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》为座右铭，认真学习《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》重要社论、文章，坚决贯彻执行省革命委员会的通告和呼吁书。用毛泽东思想武装头脑，提高对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和两条路线斗争实质的认识。在夺权斗争中，大造“私”字的反，搞好灵魂深处的革命，克服个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义、自由主义等不良倾向，大立“公”字，争当无产阶级革命派。
    二、坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边。我们的伟大统帅毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的号召，也是对民兵的战斗号召。广大民兵在斗争中，一定要用阶级分析的方法，分清敌我，站稳立场，最坚决、最勇敢地参加和支持革命派，把斗争的锋芒指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底搞好夺权斗争。受欺骗和蒙蔽的民兵，应该很快醒悟过来，认清大方向，狠杀回马枪，和革命派一起，团结对敌，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    三、热烈拥护、坚决服从、勇敢保卫省的临时最高权力机构——黑龙江省革命委员会。对待这个临时最高权力机构的态度，就是对待无产阶级革命的态度。谁反对它，就是反对革命；谁反对它，就坚决和他斗争到底。
    四、坚决响应毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，勇敢地担起革命和生产的两副重担。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，要坚守生产岗位，彻底揭露阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计。外出串连的民兵，要赶快回本地区、本单位去，就地闹革命。当前，农村备耕、春耕大忙季节已经到来，农村民兵，要紧急行动起来，狠抓革命，猛促生产，做抓革命、促生产的模范。
    五、坚决担负保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务。无产阶级文化大革命是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的。在运动中，民兵要正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾。对确有证据的杀人、放火、放毒、破坏、盗窃国家机密等现行反革命分子和反革命组织，要积极协同公安机关坚决镇压。对地、富、反、坏、右分子，实行专政，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动，如果乱说乱动，坚决依法严处。对人民内部矛盾一律不准动用民兵。严防阶级敌人挑动和利用民兵镇压革命群众。民兵的领导权一定要掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，为无产阶级服务。
    各级人民武装部门和广大民兵，让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，斗倒斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，扫除一切牛鬼蛇神，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而奋斗！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                  中国人民解放军黑龙江省军区
