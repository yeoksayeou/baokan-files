Guam

Guam is an important military base for U.S. imperialism in the Pacific region, serving as a strategic air force and Polaris missile submarine base. The U.S. B-52 bombers that frequently bomb the demilitarized zone in North Vietnam and the liberated areas in South Vietnam take off from Guam.

Guam is located in the central Pacific and is the largest island in the Mariana Islands. It serves as a midway point between Hawaii, Wake Island, and Manila. The island is narrow and elongated, with an area of over 530 square kilometers. In 1565, Guam was occupied by Spain. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, the island became a U.S. colony. In December 1941, Guam was occupied by Japan, but in August 1944, it was reoccupied by the United States.

After the war, U.S. imperialism spent tens of billions of dollars to build a series of military bases in the Pacific, including Guam. The military ports, airfields, and other facilities on Guam are more complete than those on the Hawaiian Islands, making it a key naval and air base and logistics supply center for U.S. aggression in Southeast Asia and the expansion of the Vietnam War.

    关岛
    关岛是美帝国主义在太平洋地区战略空军和北极星导弹核潜艇的重要军事基地。经常到越南北方非军事区和越南南方解放区狂轰滥炸的美国Ｂ—52型轰炸机，就是从关岛起飞的。
    关岛位于太平洋中部，是马利亚纳群岛中最大的一个岛屿，是夏威夷—威克岛—马尼拉的中途站。岛形狭长，面积五百三十多平方公里。一五六五年关岛被西班牙占领。一八九八年美西战争后，该岛沦为美国殖民地。一九四一年十二月间，关岛曾被日本占据，一九四四年八月再次被美国占领。
    战后，美帝国主义花了几十亿美元在太平洋建立包括关岛在内的一系列军事基地。关岛上的军港、飞机场及其他军事设施，比夏威夷群岛上更为完善，它已成为美国侵略东南亚和扩大侵越战争的海空军基地和后勤供应中心。（附图片）
