	Revolution in the Depths of the Soul
	– The Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Discusses Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests

	To be loyal to Chairman Mao, to be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest public interest.

	The "private" character is the source of all evil, while the "public" character is the essence of revolution. Only by seizing the power of the "private" character in one's mind can one be forever loyal to Chairman Mao and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	The "private" character is the great enemy in the minds of proletarian revolutionaries. With the enemy in front of us, we must have the necessity to defeat it. All forms of small-groupism, individualism, factionalism, and personal gain under the control of the "private" character must be thoroughly defeated.

	Those who engage in revolution for personal gain can rebel against this and that, but they will not rebel against the "private" character in their own minds. Such people cannot be true revolutionaries.

	True proletarian revolutionary warriors always put the "public" character first. They do not seek fame or profit but dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to communism. They dare to fight and struggle against class enemies without fear; they also dare to confront and eliminate private thoughts, this ideological enemy, without letting up. They are true revolutionary warriors on both fronts.

	Individualism is a "roadblock" on the path to the truth of the proletariat. To kick away this "roadblock," one must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fiercely combat the "private" character, and firmly establish the "public" character.

	All true revolutionaries must not only attack the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road but also set up a battlefield in the depths of their own souls to wage the struggle of breaking private interests and establishing public interests. Only by achieving victory on the battlefield of breaking private interests and establishing public interests can one achieve true victory in the struggle against class enemies.

	The struggle to break private interests and establish public interests must be carried out continuously. One must frequently hold "struggle meetings" for oneself and not just "victory celebrations."

    灵魂深处闹革命
    ——无产阶级革命派谈破私立公
    千公万公，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最大的公。
      “私”字是万恶之源，“公”字是革命之本。只有夺了头脑中“私”字的权，才能永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
      “私”字是无产阶级革命派头脑中的大敌。大敌当前，我们有打倒它的必要。一切“私”字支配下的小团体主义、风头主义、分散主义、个人主义等等，必须统统打倒。
    怀着个人目的闹革命的人，他可以这也“造反”，那也“造反”，可就是不去造自己头脑里“私”字的反。这种人，不可能是真正的革命者。
    真正的无产阶级革命战士都是“公”字当头，他们不为名，不为利，一心为了共产主义。对阶级敌人敢打敢拚，毫不胆怯；对待私心杂念这个思想敌人，同样敢刺刀见红，毫不放松。他们在这两个战场上都是真正的革命战士。
    个人主义是通向无产阶级真理道路上的
  “拦路虎”。要踢开这个
  “拦路虎”，就要努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。
    一切真正的革命者，既要向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进攻，还要在自己的灵魂深处摆战场，展开破私立公的战斗。只有在破私立公的战场上取得胜利，才能在与阶级敌人搏斗的战场上取得真正的胜利。
    破私立公的斗争要不断进行，要经常给自己开
  “斗争会”，不能老给自己开“庆功会”。
