	Indian minority nationalities' armed forces continue to attack reactionary military and police.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, the Mizo and Naga peoples in eastern India have continued their armed struggle against the reactionary government.

	According to Indian newspapers, the Mizo armed forces attacked government troops in the Mizo Hills from the 13th to the 15th. In the past few weeks, especially from the 25th of February to the 1st of March, the Mizo people engaged in multiple battles with government troops, striking a powerful blow against the Indian reactionary government's plot to forcibly relocate the Mizo people to concentrated settlement areas.

	At the end of February, when the Indian government held its deceptive elections, the Naga armed forces frequently attacked polling stations and election officials, forcing the suspension of voting in some areas.

	On the 1st of March, near the Naga inhabited areas, an Indian government patrol train derailed due to a blown-up railway track. The Indian Railway Protection Force personnel on the train were attacked, resulting in one death and five injuries. According to reports, this was the second incident of railway track sabotage in the region within a week.

    狠狠打击反动政府的民族压迫政策
    印度少数民族武装不断袭击反动军警
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度东部地区的米佐部族和那加族人民，最近继续开展反对反动政府的武装斗争。
    据印度报纸透露，米佐部族武装从十三日到十五日接连在米佐山区袭击了政府军。在过去几个星期内，特别是从二月二十五日到三月一日为止的五天内，米佐部族同政府军发生了多次战斗，有力地打击了印度反动政府把米佐人民强行迁移到集中居住地点的阴谋。
    在二月底，当印度政府举行欺骗人民的大选时，那加族武装经常袭击投票站和负责大选的官员，迫使一些地区的投票工作无法举行。
    三月一日，在那加族居住地区附近，印度政府的一列巡逻列车由于铁轨被炸断而出轨。列车上的印度护路特别部队人员遭到袭击，被打死一人，打伤五人。据报道，这是在这个地区一个星期内第二次炸断铁轨的事件。
