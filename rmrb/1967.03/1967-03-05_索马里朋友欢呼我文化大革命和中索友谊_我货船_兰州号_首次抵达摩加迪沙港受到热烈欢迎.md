The Chinese cargo ship "Lanzhou" arrived in Mogadishu on March 1 and, after a two-day visit, departed on March 3. This was the first time a Chinese ship had visited Somalia.

On the afternoon of March 2, Charge d'Affaires Zheng Peitang of the Chinese Embassy held a reception on board the "Lanzhou" to welcome the ship's visit to Somalia. Attending the reception were Deputy Speaker of the Somali National Assembly Ahmad Gumani Rubble, members of the National Assembly, government officials, and representatives from various sectors.

The reception was held on board the "Lanzhou." Deputy Speaker Rubble had a friendly conversation with the ship's captain. He expressed on behalf of the Somali government and people a warm welcome to the "Lanzhou" for its visit to Somalia and wished for the ever-growing friendship between the two countries. The guests also, accompanied by the ship's captain, carefully toured the ship.

Many guests wrote in the commemorative album, enthusiastically praising the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman of the Somali Writers Association Abdullaqizi Nur Hersi wrote: "We believe that strengthening our friendship is very important for our common struggle against imperialism led by the United States. I congratulate the Chinese people on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the greatest Marxist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong. Long live Sino-Somali friendship!"

External Affairs Secretary of the Somali Socialist Revolutionary Party Said Farah Abdi wrote: "We, the Somali visitors, were deeply moved by the warm and friendly welcome from the fraternal Chinese crew. This is a manifestation of adhering to the teachings of the greatest Marxist-Leninist, the greatest leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The first Chinese ship to arrive in Somalia has contributed to strengthening the friendship between the peoples of Somalia and China. Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Leader of the Somali Coast Liberation Front Muhammad Dahaan wrote: "This Chinese cargo ship arrived in Mogadishu during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao. The visit of the Chinese cargo ship has contributed to the friendship between the peoples of Somalia and China and to the struggle against imperialism and the betrayers of Marxism-Leninism. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!"
