As U.S. imperialist warships increasingly frequently enter Hong Kong, the large number of U.S. aggressor troops on these ships have been running amok in Hong Kong, committing all sorts of crimes, which has aroused great indignation among Hong Kong residents. According to a report by the Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* on the 17th, a U.S. sailor named Sarasha from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" on the 15th suddenly punched an out-of-service taxi driver without any reason, breaking the driver's glasses and injuring his left eye. This incident has aroused great anger among Hong Kong residents.
