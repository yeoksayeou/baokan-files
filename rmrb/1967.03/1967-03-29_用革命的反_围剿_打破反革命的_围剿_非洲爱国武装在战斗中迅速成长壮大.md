Patriotic armed forces in African countries fighting against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys are growing stronger and more resilient in their struggles against encirclement.

Currently, the countries in Africa where the flames of people's armed struggle are burning include the Congo (Kinshasa), Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and Zimbabwe. The patriotic armed forces in these countries have been fighting for varying lengths of time, from over six years to just recently formed. Although the duration and specific circumstances of their armed struggles differ, they all share a common experience: as soon as the flames of armed struggle appear, imperialism and its lackeys become extremely alarmed and launch frenzied encirclement campaigns. From the moment of their birth, patriotic armed forces have been engaged in unyielding struggles against these counter-revolutionary encirclements. Through these battles, the sparks of armed struggle have not been extinguished but have grown stronger and more expansive. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "Just causes enjoy bright prospects, whereas unjust causes are doomed to perish."

After the Congo (Kinshasa) declared independence in 1960, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists colluded to send so-called "United Nations troops" controlled by the U.S. to suppress patriotic forces, assassinate national hero Lumumba, overthrow the legitimate government, and install a puppet regime, committing all manner of evil deeds. It was during this period of frenzied encirclement of revolutionary people that a patriotic armed force led by Mulele ignited the flames of armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in the western region of Kwilu in the Congo (Kinshasa) in early 1964. Subsequently, patriotic armed struggles quickly developed in the northeastern and eastern regions of the Congo (Kinshasa). The U.S. imperialists carried out bloody suppression against the patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Kinshasa), providing military funds and weapons to the puppet regime and even dispatching troops from Belgium and Britain to directly occupy the important city of Stanleyville in the northeastern front in November 1964. The puppet regime also recruited white mercenaries to assist in suppression, deploying its elite forces against the people's armed forces in the Kwilu region. However, after more than two years of fierce struggle, this guerrilla base remained unshaken, not only surviving but also recently expanding. This patriotic armed force, which initially had only two or three guns, has now grown into a powerful force.

In the dark colonial rule of Portugal in Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea, the situation is similar. Portuguese colonialists, in order to extinguish the flames of people's armed struggle, continuously dispatched colonial troops. In areas where people's armed forces appeared, they implemented extremely brutal policies of burning, killing, and destroying, creating "no-man's lands." The U.S. imperialists and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization also provided various modern weapons to Portugal. The U.S. and Soviet revisionists also used various despicable means to divide and disintegrate the nationalist organizations of these countries. However, the result of the enemy's counter-revolutionary encirclement was that the patriotic armed forces of these countries were tempered and became even stronger. In the vast areas of the northern Kwanza and Luanda provinces near the capital of Angola, the first guerrilla base was established as early as 1961. In southern Angola, a new front was opened last year, and about a thousand colonial troops were annihilated in one year. In Mozambique, patriotic armed forces also broke through the encirclement of the Portuguese colonial authorities, and their operational range has now expanded to nearly half of the country.

Since the Zimbabwean people launched their armed struggle last year, they have been repeatedly subjected to military encirclement by the Smith colonial regime backed by British and American imperialism. However, they bravely persisted in armed struggle, frequently taking the initiative to attack, annihilating more than 200 enemy soldiers and police, and shooting down multiple U.S. helicopters.

All these African patriotic armed forces are composed of awakened people and rely on awakened people. They are fighting a just war. Therefore, they cannot be encircled or extinguished. On the contrary, they have grown stronger and more numerous in their struggles against encirclement. This fact once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's statement that "the ultimate power of war lies in the masses."

More and more African guerrilla fighters, through their personal combat experiences, deeply feel the correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings on people's war. Therefore, they sincerely love Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They eagerly seek and study Chairman Mao's works. Guerrilla fighters in the Congo (Kinshasa) regard Chairman Mao's works as a guiding light. Some leaders of the guerrilla forces always carry Chairman Mao's military works with them, saying, "Anything can be lost, but Chairman Mao's works must never be lost." Guerrilla fighters in Angola regard Chairman Mao's works as the most powerful ideological weapon for defeating the enemy.

Some African guerrilla fighters have begun to apply Chairman Mao's military thoughts in their struggles against encirclement. Many can recite the sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: "When the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy halts, we harass; when the enemy is tired, we attack; when the enemy retreats, we pursue." Fighters in the Congo (Kinshasa) say that after studying the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," their discipline has improved. Through study, they gradually established the ideas of building rural bases, surrounding cities from the countryside, and self-reliance. After mastering the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses have greater fighting power and stronger confidence.

Through studying Chairman Mao's works, the patriotic armed forces in Africa have come to realize that widely mobilizing the masses and closely relying on the masses is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous victories of all patriotic armed forces. The patriotic armed forces in the western Congo (Kinshasa) recently published a new magazine, "Guerrilla Fighter," to strengthen "the ideological and political education of soldiers, mobilize and organize the masses, and carry out political struggles." The Zimbabwe African National Union also called on its soldiers to conduct political propaganda among the masses and mobilize the broad masses to participate in armed struggle.

Because the patriotic armed forces in Africa attach importance to mobilizing the peasant masses, they have received strong support from the peasants in their struggles against encirclement. In the Congo (Kinshasa), the broad peasantry provides the guerrilla forces with food and intelligence. To reduce the burden on the masses, the soldiers themselves cultivate land, raise livestock, and establish fishery cooperatives. The Mobutu puppet regime conducted a brutal "sweep" in the Kwilu region last year and, under the command of U.S. military "advisors," established so-called "resettlement camps" similar to the "strategic hamlets" in South Vietnam. However, with the help of the masses, the guerrilla forces established political committees within the "resettlement camps" to lead the masses in their struggles. In northern Angola, Portuguese colonialists forcibly relocated scattered peasants to areas near their fortresses, attempting to sever the connection between the guerrilla forces and the people. However, with the help of the masses, the guerrilla forces still managed to organize the peasants and establish "action committees," further strengthening their forces.

An article in the January 1967 issue of the organ of the National Liberation Committee of the Congo (Kinshasa), "Revolution," stated that after summarizing the experiences and lessons of three years of struggle, we believe that the correct line is to execute Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings on people's war, both politically and strategically, according to the situation and specific conditions in the Congo (Kinshasa).

Using revolutionary counter-encirclement to break the counter-revolutionary encirclement is the main form of people's armed struggle in Africa today. The patriotic armed forces of various African countries all have a history of heroic struggles against encirclement. Although their paths are tortuous and the struggles will have setbacks, the sparks will surely become a prairie fire. As Chairman Mao taught: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. War educates the people, the people will win the war, win peace, and win progress." The awakened people of Africa will surely, through one encirclement struggle after another, ultimately encircle and annihilate imperialism and its lackeys.

    用革命的反“围剿”打破反革命的“围剿”
    非洲爱国武装在战斗中迅速成长壮大
    新华社二十八日讯 本社记者报道：为反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗而进行英勇斗争的非洲国家的爱国武装力量，正在反“围剿”斗争中不断成长，锻炼得更加坚强。
    目前非洲燃烧着人民武装斗争烈火的国家包括刚果（利）、安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、津巴布韦等。这些国家的爱国武装力量，有的已经坚持斗争六年多，有的刚刚诞生不久。虽然他们进行武装斗争的时间长短不一，情况不完全相同，但都有过一个同样的历程，即：武装斗争烽火一出现，帝国主义及其走狗总是万分惊慌，立即进行疯狂的“围剿”。爱国武装从诞生之日起，便不停地进行反对反革命的“围剿”的英勇斗争。在搏斗中，武装斗争的星星之火不仅没有被扑灭，相反爱国武装在反“围剿”的斗争暴风雨中成长了，壮大了。正如毛主席指出的：“正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”
    刚果（利）在一九六○年宣布独立后，美帝和苏修勾结在一起，很快就派了打着“联合国军”旗号的美国控制的侵略军去扼杀爱国力量，杀害民族英雄卢蒙巴，颠覆合法政府，扶植傀儡政权，干尽一切坏事。就在这种疯狂“围剿”革命人民的日子里，一支由缪勒尔领导的爱国武装于一九六四年初在刚果（利）西部的克韦卢地区点燃起反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争烈火。接着，在刚果（利）的东北部和东部地区，爱国武装斗争也迅速发展起来。美帝国主义对刚果（利）人民爱国武装实行血腥镇压，它向傀儡政权提供军费和武器，而且还在一九六四年十一月伙同比利时、英国帝国主义派兵直接侵占爱国武装东北线的重要城市斯坦利维尔。傀儡政权还引进白人雇佣军帮助镇压，把它最精锐的兵力用于对付克韦卢地区的人民武装。但是经过两年多的殊死搏斗，这个游击根据地岿然不动，不但没有被消灭，而且最近一个时期还有发展扩大。这支爱国武装最初只有两三支枪，现在已发展为一支强大的武装力量。
    在葡萄牙殖民主义黑暗统治下的安哥拉、莫三鼻给和“葡属”几内亚，情况也一样。葡萄牙殖民主义为了扑灭这些国家的人民武装斗争烈火，不断增派殖民军。对出现人民武装的地区实行极端残暴的烧光、杀光、毁光政策，制造“无人地带”。美帝国主义和北大西洋公约侵略集团的其他成员国也向葡萄牙提供各种现代化武器。美帝和苏修还用各种卑鄙手段分化和瓦解这些国家的民族主义组织。但是，敌人进行反革命“围剿”的结果却使这些国家的爱国武装锻炼得更加坚强。在离安哥拉首都不远的北宽扎州和罗安达州的广大地区内，早在一九六一年就建立了第一个游击根据地。在安哥拉南部，去年开辟了新的战线，去年一年就歼灭殖民军约一千人。在莫三鼻给，爱国武装也打破葡萄牙殖民当局的“围剿”，活动范围现在已经扩大到全国近一半的地区。
    津巴布韦人民去年展开武装斗争以来，不断遭到英美帝国主义支持下的史密斯殖民当局的军事“围剿”，但他们英勇地坚持武装斗争，经常主动出击，去年歼灭敌人军警二百多名，击落直升美机多架。
    所有这些非洲爱国武装，都是来自觉醒了的人民，依靠觉醒了的人民，他们进行的是正义的战争。因此，他们是“围剿”不完，扑灭不了的。相反，他们在反“围剿”的战斗中不断发展壮大了，这一事实，又一次证明毛主席所说的“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”的论断的英明正确。
    越来越多的非洲游击战士从他们的亲身战斗经历中，深刻地体会到毛主席关于人民战争的教导的英明正确，因此他们衷心热爱毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们如饥似渴地寻求和学习毛主席著作。刚果（利）游击战士把毛主席的著作看作是指路明灯。游击队的一些领导人每天都随身带着毛主席的军事著作，他们说：“任何东西都可以丢，就是毛主席著作万万不能丢。”安哥拉游击战士把毛主席著作看作是战胜敌人的最强大的思想武器。
    一些非洲游击战士们开始注意在反“围剿”斗争中运用毛主席的军事思想。许多人都能背诵游击战的十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”。刚果（利）战士说，他们在学习“三大纪律八项注意”后，纪律性增强了。他们还通过学习，逐步树立起建立农村根据地、农村包围城市、自力更生等思想。革命群众在掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想后，战斗力就更大，信心就更强了。
    通过学习毛主席著作，非洲爱国武装力量认识到广泛地动员群众，紧紧地依靠群众，是一切爱国武装力量不断取得胜利的根本保证。刚果（利）西线爱国武装前不久新出版了一个刊物《游击战士》以加强“对战士进行思想和政治教育，动员和组织群众以及进行政治斗争”。津巴布韦非洲民族联盟也号召它领导下的战士在群众中展开政治宣传，动员广大群众参加武装斗争。
    由于非洲爱国武装重视发动农民群众，他们在反“围剿”斗争中得到农民的有力支持。在刚果（利），广大农民给游击队送粮食送情报，战士们为了减轻群众的负担，自己开荒种地，饲养家畜，成立渔业合作社。蒙博托傀儡政权去年在克韦卢地区进行残酷的“扫荡”，并在美国军事“顾问”的指挥下建立了类似南越“战略村”的所谓“收容站”，但是游击队在群众帮助下，在“收容站”内成立了政治委员会，领导群众斗争。在安哥拉北部，葡萄牙殖民者强行把散住的农民赶到他们的碉堡附近的地区去，妄图隔断游击队和人民群众的联系。但是游击队在群众帮助下，仍然深入里面把农民组织起来，建立了“行动委员会”，游击队力量还得到新的发展。
    刚果（利）全国解放委员会机关刊物《革命》今年一月号发表的一篇文章说，在总结了三年斗争的经验教训之后，我们认为，正确的路线是根据刚果（利）的形势和具体条件，去执行毛泽东主席关于人民战争的政治上和战略上的教导。
    用革命的反“围剿”打破反革命的“围剿”，是今天非洲人民武装斗争的主要形式。非洲各国爱国武装力量都有一部可歌可泣的反“围剿”斗争的历史。尽管他们的道路是曲折的，斗争还会有反复，但是星星之火，必将燎原。正如毛主席所教导的：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，“战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争，赢得和平，又赢得进步。”非洲觉醒了的人民必将通过一次又一次的反“围剿”斗争，最后胜利地把帝国主义及其走狗围剿得干干净净。（附图片）
