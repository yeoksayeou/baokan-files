Chairman Mao's letter warms our hearts,
With big red characters it comes to us.
Chairman Mao's letter is like a spring breeze,
Blowing wave after wave, moving mountains and rivers.

Focus on revolution and vigorously promote production,
We poor and lower-middle peasants work together.
Revolutionary cadres take the lead,
The spring plowing battlefield is set up.

People and horses cheer with high spirits,
Cars loaded with snow are overturned in the fields.
A scene of abundance is in our hearts,
Mao Zedong Thought takes command.

Compete for every grain of rice as if it were a treasure,
Supporting the revolution cannot be neglected.
Holding a handful of spring soil brings joy to the heart,
We must achieve both revolutionary and production victories!

    毛主席的信是春风
    艾农
    斗大的红字暖人心，
    毛主席给咱来了信。
    毛主席的信是春风，
    阵阵吹得山河动。
    大抓革命狠促生产，
    咱贫下中农齐心干。
    革命干部争先来，
    春耕战场大摆开。
    人欢马叫干劲高，
    车车积雪田里倒。
    丰收图景在胸怀，
    毛泽东思想挂了帅。
    争一颗粮食争一颗宝，
    支援革命不能少。
    握一把春泥乐心头，
    定要革命、生产双丰收！
