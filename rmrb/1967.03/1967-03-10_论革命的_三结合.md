Chairman Mao has proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is best called the Revolutionary Committee.

This is the political and organizational guarantee for the victory of the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power. The proletarian revolutionaries must correctly understand this policy and correctly implement it.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ must be composed of representatives from revolutionary mass organizations that truly represent the broad masses, representatives from the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres. None of these three elements can be missing; neglecting or underestimating the role of any one of them is wrong.

After more than half a year of the tumultuous mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the masses have been fully mobilized, and a large number of new revolutionary mass representatives have emerged. The broad revolutionary masses are the foundation for the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They are the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ.

The genuine proletarian revolutionaries, the new revolutionary mass representatives, have made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are the new forces nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and embody the revolutionary direction.

This struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a mass movement led by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core, from the bottom up. In the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, the role of the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations must be fully played, and their opinions must be valued. They must not be treated as mere decorations because they represent the broad revolutionary masses. If their role is not recognized or belittled, it is a denial of the revolutionary masses and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If they are excluded and treated as mere decorations, it will be impossible to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. It will not be a revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In every great revolutionary mass movement, it is inevitable that some shortcomings and errors will appear. We must see the essence and the mainstream, and see the revolutionary direction. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the shortcomings and errors of the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations who truly represent the broad masses are a problem of one finger out of ten, a problem of progress. As a proletarian revolutionary, one should see that their direction is correct, see that they have many strengths, and humbly learn from them. Regarding their shortcomings and errors, one should help them with enthusiasm, patience, and guidance. One should also see that many revolutionary mass organizations themselves study and apply Chairman Mao's works, identify and correct erroneous tendencies within their own organizations. This is a precious revolutionary awareness and creativity. While seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, seizing the "self" in one's head from the "private" character is exactly what the revolutionary masses themselves have proposed.

Ultimately, the attitude towards the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations who truly represent the broad masses participating in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ is a matter of attitude towards the masses and the mass movement. It is also an important indicator of whether one can implement the proletarian revolutionary line with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes," "The people have limitless creativity," "Only the people, and they alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Any organization or individual that separates itself from the broad revolutionary masses will certainly not be able to implement the proletarian revolutionary line with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core.

The tumultuous mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past half year has severely tested our cadre corps. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed. At the same time, it has been proven that the majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. The view that generally rejects and overthrows all cadres is completely wrong. It should be noted that this cannot be blamed on the masses. The idea of generally rejecting and overthrowing all cadres, without distinguishing right from wrong, is the advocacy of those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, and they did exactly that. The residual poison of this view has not been eliminated in the minds of some comrades, and thus they have unconsciously committed this error to a certain extent.

In every locality, department, and enterprise and institution, there are large numbers of revolutionary cadres. Even in places and departments where the power-holders taking the capitalist road have been in control for a long time, it is the same, although the revolutionary cadres there have been suppressed for a long time. We must see this.

The role of revolutionary cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ must be fully recognized. They should and can play a core and backbone role in this organ. Of course, only by combining with the masses and walking the mass line in work can they play this role.

Cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they criticize and correct their mistakes, draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, and genuinely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core, should be united with them according to the principle that revolution does not distinguish between early and late comers, and they should be arranged to do appropriate work. Many of them can also participate in the temporary power organ.

However, those who insist on their mistakes and do not draw a clear line with the power-holders taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line should not be forced into the "three-in-one combination" power organ by the masses. Otherwise, it would not be a revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and it would be impossible to talk about seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. It would lead to new reversals and even allow the overthrown power-holders taking the capitalist road to return to power.

We must be vigilant against those who distort the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," use it as an excuse to engage in conciliationism, compromise, and amalgamation, and even try every means to pull the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party into the power organ. This is to muddy the waters and seize the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. All revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres must resolutely resist, resolutely oppose, and resolutely smash the class enemy's conspiracy.

The great People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao calls on the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad revolutionary leftist masses, which has great strategic significance.

Experience has shown that in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, the participation of representatives from the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army has played a very important role in completing the task of seizing power.

With the participation of the People's Liberation Army in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ and the support of the People's Liberation Army, the local proletarian revolutionaries have greater strength. The class enemy is most afraid of the People's Liberation Army and most afraid of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" with military cadres participating. They spare no effort to spread rumors and fabricate facts, attempting to sow discord between the revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army, and to incite some uninformed masses to direct the struggle against the People's Liberation Army. The class enemy's conspiracy must be fully exposed and resolutely struck down.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an exceptionally revolutionary army of the proletariat, unparalleled in the world. Chairman Mao said, "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and to serve them heart and soul is the sole purpose of this army." For this reason, all revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary masses trust the People's Liberation Army and enthusiastically support the participation of local garrison representatives in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ. From top to bottom, in all units that need to seize power, military representatives or militia representatives must participate to form the "three-in-one combination." Whether in factories, rural areas, commerce, education (universities, middle schools, primary schools), party and government organs, or mass organizations, this must be done. County-level and above should send military representatives, and commune-level and below should send militia representatives. This is very good. If there are not enough military representatives, they can be temporarily absent and sent later.

The attitude towards the People's Liberation Army is the attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat and is an important indicator of whether one is a genuine revolutionary leftist.

In some places, due to the complex class struggle situation, some comrades in the local troops may make temporary mistakes in their support work. When such problems arise, genuine revolutionary leftists should adopt appropriate and friendly methods to explain the situation to the responsible comrades in the troops and put forward opinions, and should absolutely not adopt a public confrontational attitude. They should not direct the struggle against the People's Liberation Army. Otherwise, they will make a big mistake, do something that hurts friends and pleases enemies, and be used by the class enemy.

The People's Liberation Army has made important contributions in supporting the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power. All officers and soldiers should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, closely rely on the broad revolutionary masses, humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, first be the students of the masses, and then be the teachers of the masses. They should be good at consulting with the masses and conducting thorough investigations. By doing so, they can strongly support the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power, further strengthen military-civilian relations, and the troops themselves can be tempered and improved in the struggle.

The "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ must be revolutionary, representative, and authoritative of the proletariat. This power organ must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core and resolutely oppose the bourgeois reactionary line. It must not be a compromise, conciliationist, or amalgamationist organ. Only in this way can it be representative, represent the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Only in this way can it be authoritative of the proletariat, exercise strong centralized leadership on the broadest democratic basis, and exercise strong dictatorship over the class enemy. It can smash the various forms of counter-revolutionary restoration plots of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society.

The big question facing the people of the whole country now is whether to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end or to stop halfway. All revolutionary comrades must keep a clear head and must not become confused. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." At present, we must especially remember Chairman Mao's teaching.

### 论革命的“三结合”

    论革命的“三结合”
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期社论
    毛主席提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。
    这是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争取得胜利的政治保证和组织保证。无产阶级革命派要正确地领会这个方针，正确地执行这个方针。
    革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，要由真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表、革命领导干部组成。三者缺一不可，忽视或者低估那一方面的作用，都是错误的。
    经过半年多轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，充分地发动了群众，涌现出一大批新起的革命群众的代表人物。广大革命群众，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的基础，是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础。
    真正的无产阶级革命派，新起的革命群众的代表人物，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。他们是毛泽东思想哺育起来的新生力量，他们体现了革命的大方向。
    这一次向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，是以毛主席为首的党中央领导的自下而上的群众运动。在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中，必须充分发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用，必须重视他们的意见，而绝不能把他们当做陪衬，因为他们是广大革命群众的代表。如果不承认或贬低他们的作用，那就是否定革命群众，否定无产阶级文化大革命。如果排斥他们，把他们当做陪衬，那就不可能建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构，那就不可能是革命的“三结合”。
    在一切大革命群众运动中，出现一些缺点和错误，是难免的。必须看清本质和主流，看清革命的大方向。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人的缺点和错误，是十个指头中的一个指头的问题，是前进中的问题。作为一个无产阶级革命家，应该看到他们的大方向是正确的，看到他们有许多长处，虚心地向他们学习，对于他们的缺点和错误，则应该满腔热情地、耐心地、循循善诱地帮助他们。还应该看到，许多革命群众组织自己活学活用毛主席著作，提出了自己组织中存在的错误倾向和纠正的方法。这是一种可贵的革命的自觉性和创造性。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，正是革命群众自己提出来的。
    归根结底，对待真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人参加“三结合”的临时权力机构的态度问题，就是对待群众、对待群众运动的态度问题，也是能不能执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。我们必须时时刻刻记住毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”。任何组织和个人脱离了广大革命群众，那就一定不能贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    半年多来的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，严峻地考验了我们的干部队伍。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揭露出来了。同时，证明了我们的大多数干部是好的和比较好的。那种对干部一概排斥、一概打倒的观点，是完全错误的。需要指出，这不能责怪群众。对干部不分青红皂白，一概排斥、一概打倒，这是提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人的主张，他们就是这样干的。这种余毒在某些同志的头脑里没有肃清，因而也不自觉地在一定程度上犯过这种错误。
    各个地方，各个部门，各个企业事业单位，都有大批的革命干部。就是在被走资本主义道路当权派所盘据的一些地方和一些部门，也是这样，不过那里的革命干部长期受到压抑罢了。我们必须看到这一点。
    革命干部参加“三结合”的临时权力机构的作用，必须充分估计。他们应该而且可能在这个机构中起核心作用和骨干作用。当然，只有和群众相结合，在工作中走群众路线，才能起到这种作用。
    犯有错误的干部，只要检讨错误，改正错误，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，真正站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，就应该按照革命不分先后的原则，团结他们，安排他们适当的工作，其中许多人还可以参加临时权力机构。
    但是，不能把坚持错误、不同走资本主义道路当权派划清界限、不同资产阶级反动路线划清界限的人，强加在群众头上，硬拉到“三结合”的权力机构中来。否则，那就不是革命的
  “三结合”，那就根本谈不到向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，那就会出现新的反复，甚至使被打倒的走资本主义道路当权派重新上台。
    我们必须警惕，有人歪曲革命的“三结合”的方针，借口
  “三结合”，搞折中主义，调和主义，合二而一，甚至千方百计地把党内走资本主义道路当权派拉进来。这就是要混水摸鱼，要篡夺无产阶级文化大革命的果实，要实行反革命复辟。一切革命群众，一切革命干部，都必须坚决抵制，坚决反对，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的这种阴谋。
    伟大的人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的柱石。毛主席号召人民解放军要积极支持广大的革命左派群众，具有伟大的战略意义。
    经验证明，在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中，有人民解放军当地驻军的代表参加，对于胜利完成夺权斗争的任务，起了非常重大的作用。
    有了人民解放军干部参加的“三结合”的临时权力机构，有了人民解放军的支援，地方上的无产阶级革命派，力量就更大了。阶级敌人最害怕人民解放军，最害怕有军队干部参加的革命的“三结合”。他们费尽心机制造流言蜚语，捏造事实，妄图挑拨革命群众同人民解放军的关系，煽动一些不明真相的群众，把斗争的矛头指向人民解放军。对于阶级敌人的这种阴谋，必须给以充分揭露和坚决的打击。
    中国人民解放军，是举世无双的非常革命化的无产阶级的军队。毛主席说，“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”正因为这样，一切革命的群众组织和革命群众，都信赖人民解放军，都热烈拥护当地驻军的代表参加革命“三结合”的临时权力机构。从上至下，凡要夺权的单位，都要有军队代表或民兵代表参加，组成“三结合”。不论工厂、农村、财贸、文教（大、中、小学）、党政机关及民众团体都要这样做。县以上都派军队代表，公社以下都派民兵代表，这是非常之好的。军队代表不足，可以暂缺，将来再派。
    对于人民解放军的态度，就是对于无产阶级专政的态度，也是区别是不是真正的革命左派的一个重要标志。
    在某些地方，由于阶级斗争的情况错综复杂，当地部队的某些同志，也可能在支援工作中，犯暂时的错误。当出现这种问题的时候，真正的革命左派应该善意地采取适当的方式，向部队负责同志说明情况，提出意见，而绝不应该采取公开对抗的态度，更不能把斗争的矛头指向人民解放军。否则，就会犯绝大的错误，做出亲者痛、仇者快的事情，为阶级敌人所利用。
    人民解放军在支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，已经做出了重要贡献。全体指战员要遵照毛主席的教导，紧紧地依靠广大革命群众，虚心向革命群众学习，先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生，善于同群众商量问题，深入细致地进行调查研究。这样做，就能非常有力地支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，就能进一步密切军民关系，部队本身也就能在斗争中得到新的锻炼和提高。
    “三结合”的临时权力机构，必须是革命的，有代表性的，有无产阶级权威的。这个权力机构，必须坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对资产阶级反动路线，而不能是合二而一的、折中主义的。只有这样，它才能有代表性，才能代表广大革命群众和广大革命干部。只有这样，它才能是有无产阶级权威的，才能在最广泛的民主基础上实行强有力的集中领导，才能对阶级敌人实行强有力的专政，粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上牛鬼蛇神的各种形式的反革命复辟的阴谋。
    现在摆在全国人民面前的一个大问题，就是要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，还是半途而废。一切革命的同志，都必须保持清醒的头脑，切切不可糊涂起来。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”在当前，我们要特别记住毛主席的这个教导。
