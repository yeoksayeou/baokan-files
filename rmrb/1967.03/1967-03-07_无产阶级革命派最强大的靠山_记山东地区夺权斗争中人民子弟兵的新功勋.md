A spring thunder roared through the city of springs, red flags and songs filled the city.

The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee was born in the midst of intense class struggle! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! It is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary masses of Shandong, who united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely united with the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong and revolutionary cadres, and smashed the conspiracy of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party to falsely seize power and counter-revolutionarily seize power!

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong played a decisive role in the most critical moments of the power seizure struggle during the most acute and complex days of struggle. They made outstanding contributions. Today, as the people of Shandong celebrate this great victory with boundless enthusiasm, they express their heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to the local troops. They unanimously praise: The People's Liberation Army is the strongest pillar of proletarian dictatorship! It is the strongest backing for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat! It firmly supports the broad masses of the left.

The great call of our most beloved and respected leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left resounds through the clouds and shakes the nation. The troops stationed in Shandong, upon hearing the order, moved into action. The soldiers, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, solemnly pledged before his portrait: We will firmly support the broad masses of the left, and we will seize back all the power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and we will carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

The great new immortal feats created by the broad masses of soldiers for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat once again prove that they are indeed the soldiers of the great commander-in-chief Mao Zedong, who personally created and led the People's Liberation Army.

The branch office of the People's Bank of China in Hualin District, Jinan City is filled with joy, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are celebrating the victory of seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. People repeatedly look up at the portrait of Chairman Mao and say excitedly: Chairman Mao! It is you who timely pointed out the direction for us, gave us wisdom and strength. It is you who sent the children of the soldiers to support our revolutionary actions, achieving the great victory of the power seizure struggle!

It was not long ago that this office presented a different scene. At that time, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, in collusion with a handful of counter-revolutionaries manipulating the so-called "revolutionary rebel corps," gathered thugs to beat up the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, forcing them to disband their revolutionary organizations. Some revolutionary fighters of the proletariat had their freedom of action taken away.

However, the steadfast revolutionary fighters of the proletariat bravely stood up. They established the "Star Fire Revolutionary Rebel Corps" and were determined to fight to the end against the capitalist-roaders within the party and a handful of counter-revolutionaries.

At this critical moment when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat needed help the most, the Shandong garrison sent military representatives leading soldiers to the office to perform guard duties. As soon as the troops arrived, they hung a board with Chairman Mao's quotations at the entrance. It read: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left.

Chairman Mao's great call made the revolutionary masses feel proud and the reactionaries tremble with fear. The red rebel fighters gathered around the quotation board, looking at it over and over again, tears of excitement welling up in their eyes, unwilling to leave. They said: With Chairman Mao supporting us and the PLA fighting alongside us, we will surely be able to sweep away all the harmful elements and achieve a thorough victory in the united power seizure struggle!

"Without investigation, no right to speak." The military representatives and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, went among the masses to investigate and study. A female comrade who had been repeatedly persecuted by the bad guys led a revolutionary rebel corps that was viciously slandered as a counter-revolutionary organization. After talking with the military representative, she regained her confidence in the struggle and reorganized the "Truth Fighting Corps." Some masses feared that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat were weak and would be beaten again. The military representative assisted the revolutionary masses in organizing the study of Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle, making these comrades realize: Revolutionary power must not fall into the hands of bad elements. As long as we unite and continue to fight, victory will surely belong to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. In this way, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary forces of the proletariat in this office quickly grew stronger.

"Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolutionaries." The military representative discovered that some comrades among the revolutionary masses did not pay attention to the work of those who had been deceived, so he and the revolutionary masses together studied Chairman Mao's teachings on uniting the majority and correctly treating backward masses. Then, with deep class feelings, they separately talked to the deceived masses, explaining Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to them, explaining the party's policies, and enlightening them to draw a clear line with a handful of bad elements and move forward lightly. Many deceived masses awakened and stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, striking a "return blow."

"The three-in-one combination" is the core of the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. To implement the policy of the "three-in-one combination," it is necessary to correctly treat revolutionary cadres. One day, the revolutionary masses held a meeting of core members. The military representative gave the meeting a quotation from Chairman Mao: "It is necessary to be good at identifying cadres. Not only should one look at the deeds of a cadre at a particular time, but also at the entire history and work of a cadre. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated the eyes of the red rebel fighters. They found and brought back a revolutionary cadre who had been driven away by counter-revolutionaries for firmly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and supporting the revolutionary masses, and invited him to participate in the joint power seizure committee. For two cadres who made general mistakes in the movement, after criticism and education to raise their awareness, they were also invited to participate in the leadership work. Because they won over the majority and achieved the "three-in-one combination," they completely isolated a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and thus successfully carried out the power seizure struggle.

The most resolute suppression of a handful of counter-revolutionaries

"Only the revolutionary left is allowed to rebel, not the ghosts and snakes." This is the most distinct and firm attitude of the broad masses of soldiers in supporting the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The soldiers remember this teaching, vigilantly watching the actions of a handful of class enemies, and protecting the Cultural Revolution.

This is a counter-revolutionary incident that occurred in the Jinan Wind Power Machinery Factory. Just as the proletarian revolutionary masses of this factory were gradually uniting and preparing to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory, a handful of bad guys colluded with the ghosts and snakes inside and outside the factory to carry out a series of counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. When the Jinan Public Security Bureau decided to detain the ringleaders by law, these bad guys dared to resist the proletarian dictatorship, snatch the detention warrant, illegally detain public security personnel, provoke large-scale armed struggles, and seize more than thirty revolutionary workers who assisted public security personnel in performing their duties.

The troops stationed in Shandong, with high revolutionary vigilance, had long been paying attention to this. As soon as the news came, they immediately dispatched the "Second Daikuai Company" and propaganda vehicles to the scene.

The "Second Daikuai Company" is a company with a glorious fighting history. During the War of Liberation, to seize all the power of the Chinese people from Chiang Kai-shek, they sacrificed their heads and shed blood, creating immortal merits. Today, at the critical moment when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite and carry out the power seizure struggle, the ghosts and snakes want to cause trouble, and the class enemies want to rebel. How can the soldiers of the "Second Daikuai Company" tolerate this!

They rushed to the scene and immediately, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on uniting the people and disintegrating the enemy, launched a powerful political offensive. However, a handful of counter-revolutionaries adopted despicable means. They gathered two drum teams, surrounding the army's propaganda vehicle and beating wildly, disrupting the propaganda; at the same time, they used loudspeakers to slander and curse the public security personnel and the People's Liberation Army. This is intolerable! The soldiers, according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "the enemy will not be eliminated by itself" and "anything reactionary will not fall if you do not strike it down," decided, after consulting with the public security personnel, to strengthen political propaganda, explain the policy to some deceived masses, clarify the situation, and at the same time take decisive suppression actions. The deceived masses quickly awakened, and a handful of counter-revolutionaries were quickly exposed. Squad leader Chen Zhiguang led the entire squad, cooperating with the public security personnel to control the broadcasting room occupied by a handful of counter-revolutionaries. The public security personnel used the loudspeaker to expose the crimes of a handful of counter-revolutionaries and announced the order of detention by law. Then, the soldiers, with high morale and agile actions, quickly surrounded the counter-revolutionary den.

A handful of counter-revolutionaries were arrested, and the counter-revolutionary momentum was suppressed. The broad revolutionary masses raised their heads and clapped their hands in approval. The cheers of "Long live the People's Liberation Army! Long live the proletarian dictatorship! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" shook the city of springs.

The most resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production"

In the acute and complex class struggle, in the great struggle of actively supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses to seize power, the Shandong garrison resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They dispatched a large number of cadres and soldiers to factories and rural areas, helping the proletarian revolutionary masses to firmly grasp the revolution and greatly promote production.

On the day of celebrating the victory of seizing power, the broadcast room of the Jinan Needle and Pin Factory broadcasted a piece of heart-stirring good news: The factory's output in the second half of February increased by 69% compared to the first half. The daily output exceeded the highest level since the factory was established. This good news spread, and people were overjoyed, running to tell each other, excitedly saying: This is the victory of Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production"! This is the result of the children of the soldiers actively helping!

Indeed, this victory contains the hard work of the children of the soldiers! Several comrades from the engineering troops stationed in Jinan, after firmly supporting the revolutionary masses of this factory to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thought about a problem: Helping the proletarian revolutionary masses to seize power is only the first step. The important task ahead is to help the proletarian revolutionary masses build a new revolutionary order, push the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to a new stage, and push production to a new high. They went to the workshops and offices to study Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary workers, had heart-to-heart talks with the revolutionary workers, and explained Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" to them. When the comrades from the troops learned that some cadres, due to not understanding Chairman Mao's cadre policy, hesitated and dared not manage production boldly, they immediately reported this situation to the temporary power seizure committee of the factory and assisted the temporary power seizure committee in organizing the cadres of the factory to study Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the relevant editorials of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine four times, making them deeply understand Chairman Mao's cadre policy, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and grasp the revolution and promote production with the broad revolutionary masses. Some cadres actively proposed suggestions to the temporary power seizure committee to improve production, and some immediately went to the workshops and worked with the workers in the "four together." The revolutionary workers also expressed that they would not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and trust, and would not only be revolutionary pioneers but also models of production. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, with revolutionary passion, displayed their boundless enthusiasm, and strived to complete the production tasks. One day, a winding machine broke down. In the past, it took at least two and a half days to repair this machine. The workers, in order to make this machine quickly return to production, worked with a spirit of seizing every second, working continuously for nineteen hours, making this winding machine return to production one day earlier.

    无产阶级革命派最强大的靠山
    ——记山东地区夺权斗争中人民子弟兵的新功勋
    一声春雷震泉城，满城红旗满城歌。
    山东省革命委员会在激烈的阶级大搏斗中诞生了！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是山东省无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下大联合，同人民解放军驻山东地区部队和革命的领导干部紧密结合，粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派假夺权、反夺权阴谋的伟大胜利！
    中国人民解放军驻山东地区部队，在最尖锐复杂的斗争日子里，坚定地支持无产阶级革命派，在夺权斗争最紧要的关头，起了决定性的作用，作出了十分杰出的贡献。今天，当山东人民满怀激情地欢庆这一伟大胜利的时候，他们纷纷向当地部队表示衷心的祝贺和感激。他们齐声赞颂：人民解放军是无产阶级专政最强大的支柱！是无产阶级革命派最强大的靠山！最坚定地支持左派广大群众
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出的人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，响彻云霄，震撼全国。解放军驻山东地区部队闻令而动，指战员们怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的心情站在毛主席画像前庄严宣誓：最最坚定地支持左派广大群众，誓把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的大权统统夺回，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    广大指战员为无产阶级文化大革命创造的新的不朽功勋再一次证明，他们不愧是我们伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导的人民解放军的战士。
    中国人民银行济南市支行槐荫区办事处喜气洋洋，无产阶级革命派正在欢庆向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的胜利。人们一再仰望着毛主席画像激动地说：毛主席啊！是您老人家及时地给我们指明了方向，给我们智慧和力量。是您老人家派来子弟兵支持我们的革命行动，取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利！
    就是这个办事处，不久前却是另一番景象。那时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和被一小撮反革命分子操纵的所谓“革命造反队”互相勾结，纠集暴徒毒打无产阶级革命派战士，威逼他们解散革命组织，有些无产阶级革命派战士被剥夺了行动自由。
    但是，坚强的无产阶级革命派战士勇敢地站了出来。他们建立了“星火革命造反队”，决心同党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命分子战斗到底。
    在这无产阶级革命派最需要援助的时刻，山东驻军派出军事代表带领战士来到办事处执行警卫任务。部队一到，就在门口挂出了毛主席语录板。上面写着：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。
    毛主席的这个伟大号召，革命派看了扬眉吐气，反动派看了胆战心惊。红色造反战士围在语录板前看了一遍又一遍，激动得热泪盈眶，久久不愿离开。他们说：有毛主席支持我们，有解放军同我们并肩作战，我们一定能够扫除一切害人虫，取得联合夺权斗争的彻底胜利！
    “没有调查就没有发言权”。军事代表和战士们按照毛主席的教导，到群众中去调查研究。有一个女同志曾多次遭受坏家伙的迫害，她领导的革命造反队被恶毒地诬蔑为反革命组织。军事代表和她谈话后，她坚定了斗争的信心，重新组织了“真理战斗队”。有的群众怕无产阶级革命派力量小，再挨打受害。军事代表就协助革命群众组织学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，使这些同志认识到：革命大权决不能落到坏分子手里，只要团结起来坚持战斗，胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派。就这样，在人民解放军的支持下，这个办事处的无产阶级革命派力量迅速壮大起来了。
    “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”军事代表发现革命群众中有的同志还不注意做受蒙骗的群众的工作，便和革命群众一起学习毛主席关于团结大多数和正确对待落后群众的教导，然后，又和革命派一起带着深厚的阶级感情，分头找受蒙骗的群众个别谈心，向他们宣传毛主席的革命路线，交代党的政策，启发他们同一小撮坏分子划清界限，轻装前进。许多受蒙骗的群众觉悟了，站到毛主席的革命路线一边，大杀“回马枪”。
    “三结合”是无产阶级革命派实现大联合的核心。要贯彻执行“三结合”的方针，就必须正确对待革命的领导干部。一天，革命派召开骨干分子会议。军事代表送给会议一条毛主席语录：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”毛主席的教导，擦亮了红色造反战士的眼睛。他们把在运动中坚决执行毛主席革命路线、支持革命群众，被反革命分子撵走了的一位革命领导干部，找了回来，并吸收他参加联合夺权委员会。对两位在运动中犯有一般错误的领导干部，经过批评教育，提高觉悟后，也吸收参加领导工作。由于争取团结了大多数，实现了“三结合”，彻底孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从而胜利地进行了夺权斗争。最坚决地镇压一小撮反革命分子
    “只许革命左派造反，不许牛鬼蛇神翻天”，这是广大指战员在支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中最鲜明最坚定的态度。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”指战员们牢记着这个教导，警惕地注视着一小撮阶级敌人的行动，保卫着文化大革命。
    这是发生在济南风动机械厂的一个反革命事件。正当这个厂的无产阶级革命派逐渐联合起来，准备向厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，一小撮坏家伙勾结厂内外的牛鬼蛇神，进行了一系列反革命破坏活动。济南市公安局决定依法拘留首恶分子的时候，这一小撮坏家伙竟公然对抗无产阶级专政，夺去拘留证，非法扣押公安人员，挑起大规模的武斗，并抓去协助公安人员执行任务的革命工人群众三十多人。
    有着高度革命警惕性的驻山东地区部队对此早有注意，消息传来，他们立即派出“第二岱崮连”等部队和宣传车奔赴现场。
    “第二岱崮连”是有着光荣战斗历史的英雄连队。在解放战争时期，为了把中国人民的一切大权从蒋介石手里夺过来，他们抛头颅、洒热血，立下了不朽的功勋。今天，在无产阶级革命派大联合，进行夺权斗争的关键时刻，牛鬼蛇神要捣乱，阶级敌人要翻天，“第二岱崮连”的干部战士们怎能容忍！
    他们赶到现场，立即根据毛主席团结人民，瓦解敌军的教导，展开了强大的政治攻势。可是，这一小撮反革命分子却采取了卑劣的手段，他们拼凑了两个锣鼓队，围着部队的宣传车猛敲乱打，干扰宣传；同时利用高音喇叭诬蔑、谩骂公安人员和人民解放军。是可忍，孰不可忍！指战员们根据毛主席“敌人是不会自行消灭的”和“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”的教导，经过和公安人员商量，决定一面加强政治宣传，向一些受蒙蔽的群众讲明政策，说清情况，一面采取坚决的镇压行动。受蒙蔽的群众很快觉悟过来，一小撮反革命分子迅速暴露了。班长陈志光带领全班，协同公安人员控制了一小撮反革命分子占据的广播室。公安人员利用高音喇叭揭露了一小撮反革命分子的罪行，宣布了依法拘留的命令。接着，战士们斗志昂扬，动作敏捷，迅速包围了反革命的黑窝。
    一小撮反革命分子被抓起来了，反革命的气焰被打下去了，广大革命群众扬眉吐气，拍手叫好，“中国人民解放军万岁”“无产阶级专政万岁”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，震动泉城。
    最坚决地执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针
    在尖锐复杂的阶级大搏斗中，在积极支持无产阶级革命派夺权的伟大斗争中，山东驻军坚决执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示。他们抽调大批干部战士，奔赴工厂和农村，帮助无产阶级革命派狠抓革命，大促生产。
    在欢庆夺权胜利的日子里，济南针钉厂的广播室播出了一件振奋人心的大好消息：全厂产量，二月中旬比上旬提高了百分之六十九。日产量超过建厂以来最高水平。这一喜讯传开，人们喜笑颜开，奔走相告，激动地说：这是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利！是人民子弟兵积极帮助的结果！
    的确，这个胜利之中，包含着人民子弟兵的辛勤劳动！驻济南部队工程兵的几位同志，在坚决支持这个厂的革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺回了大权以后，就思考着一个问题：帮助无产阶级革命派夺权只是第一步，今后的重要任务是要帮助无产阶级革命派建设革命新秩序，把无产阶级文化大革命推向新的阶段，把生产推向一个新高潮。他们就到车间和科室去和革命职工一起学习毛主席著作，和革命职工促膝谈心，向他们宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针。当部队的同志了解到一部分干部，由于对毛主席的干部政策不理解，缩手缩脚，不敢大胆管理生产时，便及时将这个情况向厂的临时夺权委员会作了反映，并协助临时夺权委员会先后四次组织厂里的干部们学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志的有关社论，使他们深刻理解毛主席的干部政策，坚决站到毛主席的革命路线一边，和广大革命群众一起抓好革命，促好生产。有的干部主动向临时夺权委员会提出搞好生产的建议，有的当即到车间和工人实行“四同”。革命工人们也表示决不辜负毛主席的希望和信任，不仅要当革命的闯将，还要做生产的模范。革命工人和革命干部一起，满怀革命激情，发挥冲天干劲，努力完成生产任务。一天，一台缠条机损坏了，过去修好这台机器最少得两天半的时间，工人们为了使这台机器尽快投入生产，以争分夺秒的精神进行抢修，连续工作了十九个小时，使这台缠条机提前一天投入了生产。
