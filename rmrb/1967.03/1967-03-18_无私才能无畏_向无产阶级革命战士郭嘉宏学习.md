Sunlight and rain nourish the pine,
Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes.

Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, millions of young revolutionary fighters in our country are growing up healthily and rapidly. They are infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defending it, seeking neither fame nor wealth, fearing neither hardship nor death. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our country, and in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have created countless earth-shaking and moving heroic deeds.

Comrade Guo Jiaming, a martyr, is one such revolutionary fighter nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. He grew up in the sharp class struggle and was tempered in the storms of the struggle between the two lines. He is an outstanding representative of millions of revolutionary fighters.

When the motherland called for contributions to agricultural production, he cast aside his so-called "personal future" and "family concerns," becoming a model on the production front. When a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were wreaking havoc, he stood up and fought resolutely, becoming a revolutionary vanguard in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When state property was about to be engulfed in flames, he rushed into the fire to defend state property and bravely sacrificed his life.

Yet, this good fighter of Chairman Mao was labeled a "counter-revolutionary," "monster," and "active counter-revolutionary" by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee! He was even illegally detained and subjected to brutal struggle for four months until his death, with no redress given! The bourgeois reactionary line is so deceitful, confusing right and wrong and reversing black and white! How vile it is!

During the days when the bourgeois reactionary line created white terror, Comrade Guo Jiaming remained steadfast and fought bravely in the face of the enemy's rampant attacks. He firmly declared: "With Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee backing us... victory is ours!" The martyr's wish has been realized!

Comrade Guo Jiaming's struggle is a strong indictment of the bourgeois reactionary line and a passionate song of praise for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Where does Comrade Guo Jiaming's fearless revolutionary spirit come from?

It is the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought that has armed his mind, and it is the result of his persistent struggle to revolutionize his soul and eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness.

Only selflessness can lead to fearlessness.

Only selflessness can make one a thorough materialist who fears nothing, stands firmly, and has a clear banner. To defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, one must have the courage to overcome all obstacles and the heroic spirit of "daring to be beheaded and pull the emperor off his horse."

Only selflessness can make one a strong revolutionary fighter, constantly resisting and eliminating the infiltration and corruption of various exploitative class ideologies, constantly cleansing oneself of dust and filth. One must not be swayed by sweet words, not be hit by sugar-coated bullets, not covet money and wealth, not crave fame and position. For the lofty ideal of communism and the cause of the people, one must always maintain the revolutionary character of modesty, prudence, and hard work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to change the world includes the task of changing both the objective world and one's subjective world—changing one's ability to recognize and the relationship between one's subjective world and the objective world." Comrade Lin Biao also points out: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution also involves revolutionizing oneself. If one does not revolutionize oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls, a great revolution to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and a great revolution to sweep away all non-proletarian thoughts with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Representatives of various classes and various social trends are all coming out to perform. Under these circumstances, it is even more important to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely resist the infiltration of various non-proletarian thoughts. The broad revolutionary masses must seriously learn from Comrade Guo Jiaming's selfless and fearless communist spirit, carry out a thorough revolution in their souls, and eliminate anarchism, elitism, cliquism, and individualism. They must achieve the great unity of the revolutionary masses, achieve the "three-in-one combination," and with even higher morale and more unified steps, welcome new and even greater battles!

"Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's cause in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on the path of their blood!"

    无私才能无畏
    ——向无产阶级革命战士郭嘉宏学习
    阳光雨露育青松，毛泽东思想哺英雄。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，我国千百万年轻的无产阶级革命战士，正在健康地、迅速地成长起来。他们无限忠于毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，创造出无数惊天动地、可歌可泣的英雄业绩。
    郭嘉宏烈士，就是这样一个在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的无产阶级革命战士。他是在尖锐的阶级斗争中成长起来的，是在两条路线斗争的大风大浪里锻炼出来的。他是千百万无产阶级革命战士的优秀代表。
    当祖国一声召唤，需要为农业生产贡献力量的时候，他抛开了所谓“个人前途”“家庭牵挂”，成了生产战线上的模范；当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派兴妖作怪的时候，他挺身而出，坚决斗争，成了无产阶级文化大革命中的革命闯将；当国家财产眼看要被烈火吞没的时候，他奋身冲进火海，为保卫国家财产英勇地献出了自己的生命。
    然而，就是这样一个毛主席的好战士，竟被镇江市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打成了“反党分子”、“牛鬼蛇神”、“现行反革命”！甚至被非法关押、残酷斗争达四个月之久，直到他牺牲前夕还拒不给他平反！资产阶级反动路线，就是这样混淆是非，颠倒黑白的！何其毒也！
    郭嘉宏同志在资产阶级反动路线制造白色恐怖的日子里，在敌人的猖狂进攻面前，毫不动摇，英勇斗争。他坚定地宣告：“有毛主席和党中央给我们撑腰……胜利是属于我们的！”烈士的愿望，已经实现了！
    郭嘉宏同志的斗争事迹，正是对资产阶级反动路线最强烈的控诉，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最热情的赞歌！
    郭嘉宏同志大无畏的革命精神从何而来？
    是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了他的头脑，是他坚持在灵魂深处闹革命，不断破私立公的结果。
    无私才能无畏。
    只有无私，才能成为无所畏惧的彻底的唯物主义者，才能立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，有压倒一切的革命勇气，有“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的英雄气概。
    只有无私，才能成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士，才能不断抵制各种剥削阶级思想的侵袭腐蚀，不断地清除自己身上的灰尘污垢；香风刮不倒，糖弹打不中，不希罕金钱财物，不贪图名誉地位。为了崇高的共产主义理想，为了人民的事业，永远保持谦虚谨慎、艰苦朴素的革命本色。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系”。林彪同志也指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是破私立公的大革命，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想扫除形形色色的非无产阶级思想的大革命。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命进入了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的阶段。各个阶级的代表人物，各种社会思潮，都纷纷出来表演。在这种情况下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决抵制形形色色的非无产阶级思想的侵袭，就显得更为重要。广大的无产阶级革命派，一定要认真学习郭嘉宏同志无私无畏的共产主义精神，在灵魂深处大闹革命，搞臭无政府主义，搞臭风头主义，搞臭小团体主义，搞臭个人主义，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，以更高昂的斗志，更整齐的步伐，迎接新的更加伟大的战斗！
    “成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
