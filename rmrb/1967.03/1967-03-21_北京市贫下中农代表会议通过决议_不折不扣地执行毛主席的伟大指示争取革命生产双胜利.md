The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants from thirteen counties (districts) in the suburbs of Beijing gathered solemnly near our most, most beloved leader Chairman Mao to celebrate the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to celebrate the great unity and alliance of the poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the city! This is a victorious meeting, a united meeting, and a rally to "seize the revolution and promote production"!

The meeting expressed the common aspirations of the suburban poor and lower-middle peasants: We sincerely wish our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao eternal life!

The representatives present unanimously pledged: We will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good members of Chairman Mao's collective.

At the meeting, the representatives reviewed the battle history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the suburban rural areas in the previous stage. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, launched a fierce struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insisted on their reactionary stance, and against the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism. They struck back at the class enemies' attempt to reverse the achievements of the "Four Cleanups." The suburban rural areas presented a great revolutionary situation. The recent issuance of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and All Levels of Cadres in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country" has given us tremendous encouragement. A new high tide of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is surging ahead in the suburban rural areas.

The meeting pointed out: The class struggle in the suburban rural areas is still very intense. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, in collusion with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, are using various means to sabotage the socialist collective economy, production, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The severe class struggle is before us, and we must not be complacent or relax our vigilance. To fully and strictly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and to strive for victory in both revolution and production, we hereby resolve as follows:

	(1) **Hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the socialist revolution through to the end and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.** We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions and regulations regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in rural areas, fully rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and concentrate our efforts on striking down the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. For a long time, the old Beijing Municipal Committee and Municipal People's Committee have implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, stubbornly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fiercely opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought, and fiercely sabotaging the socialist education movement in the countryside. This counter-revolutionary revisionist line, in collusion with the power-holders taking the capitalist road in the suburban rural areas and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, has been doing nothing but counter-revolutionary restoration. We must thoroughly purge all its poisonous influences.

	To thoroughly purge the poisonous influences of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee and Municipal People's Committee, to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely repel the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. At present, there is a small handful of people who continue to stubbornly push the bourgeois reactionary line, seeking revenge and restoration. This small handful of people maliciously distort the revolutionary policy of the "three-in-one combination," whitewashing the power-holders taking the capitalist road, crying out in grievance, attempting counter-revolutionary restoration; this small handful of people seize on the shortcomings of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, confusing right and wrong, mixing black and white, attempting to overturn the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This small handful of people have always directed their spears at the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and at the Central Cultural Revolution Group that hoists high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. However, no matter what storms and rapids we encounter on the road ahead, we poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, firmly supporting the correct leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman, and firmly supporting the correct leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. In our eyes, the bourgeois reactionary line is a rat crossing the street. We must thoroughly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line and ensure it never rises again!

	We poor and lower-middle peasants must clearly recognize that throughout the entire historical period of transition from capitalism to communism, there will always be a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and a struggle for power between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. We must consciously participate in the struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and must push the socialist revolution to complete and thorough victory. From our own experiences, we deeply understand that the socialist road is our only bright path. We have only one mind, which is to follow this bright path to the end, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, block the road to capitalist restoration, and ensure that our socialist state remains red forever.

	(2) **Do a good job in spring plowing to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest throughout the year.** Doing a good job in spring plowing is an important link in implementing the policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." We must fully pay attention to this battle of spring plowing. Currently, the production leadership teams must immediately mobilize the masses to fully discuss the planting plan and increase production measures and quickly implement them in the fields; they must sow in a timely manner without missing the season; they must pay special attention to the management of returning green wheat, applying fertilizer and watering at the right time; they must sow as many early-maturing crops as possible; since last winter, there has been little rain and snow, and drought is severe, so we must accelerate the construction of water conservancy facilities, complete water conservancy projects, and carry out anti-drought and moisture-retaining activities to prepare for spring sowing; during the construction of water conservancy projects, we must combine flood control and make preparations for flood control. We must strengthen agricultural scientific and technological management, carry out scientific experiments, and do a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and pests. Currently, farm work is very urgent, and all militia and revolutionary organizations must take immediate action, and female labor must also "charge into battle," concentrating all human and material resources to do a good job in spring plowing. The rural cultural revolution must be carried out according to the central regulations during non-production time, producing during the day and making revolution at night. Any method of either producing without seizing the revolution or only producing without seizing the revolution is wrong. The poor and lower-middle peasants and all community members must increase their attendance rate, observe labor discipline, improve work quality, and quickly and well complete the production tasks. We must resolutely fight against any behavior that violates labor discipline.

	(3) **Establish and strengthen the production leadership teams.** The counties (districts) in the suburbs must seriously learn from the experience of Huairou County to establish and strengthen a "three-in-one combination" command post on the front line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," consisting of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, and representatives of local troops. We must resolutely implement the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions that production brigades and production teams should not seize power during the spring plowing period. For production brigades and production teams that have seized power and have been approved by the revolutionary masses and higher authorities, the leadership teams must shoulder the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, mobilize the masses, and do a good job in production. In production brigades and production teams where the leadership teams are weak or dispersed, the poor and lower-middle peasant activists and revolutionary cadres must step forward to form temporary leadership teams. All levels of leadership teams must use Mao Zedong Thought as the banner to mobilize all positive factors and truly grasp production. After the establishment of the production teams, we poor and lower-middle peasants must actively support them, obey their leadership, and follow their commands, and not disrupt the work of the production teams.

	(4) **Learn from the people of Dazhai and follow the Dazhai path to build a new socialist countryside.** "Learning from Dazhai in agriculture" is a great call made by Chairman Mao, a major measure to implement the general line of building socialism with great, daring, and pioneering spirit, and striving to be the best and fastest. Following the Dazhai path is the necessary way to transform the countryside with Mao Zedong Thought and build the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants in our suburbs must take Dazhai as an example, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, and launch a mass movement of emulation, learning, catching up, and helping each other, letting the red flowers of Dazhai bloom everywhere in the suburban rural areas.

	(5) **The establishment of revolutionary organizations in the countryside must be conducive to the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, conducive to "seizing the revolution and promoting production," conducive to the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and conducive to the thought revolutionization of the members of various organizations.** In general, fighting squads (teams) should be established based on production teams in the countryside, and united revolutionary mass organizations should be established within the brigade's scope. Revolutionary organizations should not be established across teams, and even less should they join workers, students, or other systems' mass organizations across industries. After the dissolution of cross-team and cross-system mass organizations, revolutionary connections can still be made between teams during non-production time.

	(6) **Correctly handle cadres.** We poor and lower-middle peasants must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, use class analysis to comprehensively examine cadres and correctly evaluate the cadre team in the countryside. We believe that the majority of rural cadres (including those in charge) are good or relatively good. For cadres who have made mistakes, we should criticize and educate them in accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," helping them correct their mistakes. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, we should allow them to reform and encourage them to make amends for their mistakes. On the other hand, we sincerely hope that cadres at all levels will listen to Chairman Mao's words, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, trust the masses, rely on the masses, go deep into the front line of production, and blend in with the masses, fully carrying forward the democratic style, consulting with the masses on all matters. We hope that cadres who have made mistakes will get rid of the "self," put down their burdens, and undergo tests in production, actively lead production, accept criticism and help from the masses, and make amends for their mistakes. If they do so, we poor and lower-middle peasants will welcome and support them.

	(7) **Respond resolutely to Chairman Mao's call to "be thrifty and make revolution" and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people."** All people's communes, production brigades, and production teams must reduce non-production expenditures and administrative expenses as much as possible. On the premise of completing the state procurement and tax collection tasks as stipulated, they must leave room for appropriate increases in the collective's capital accumulation and grain reserves. All collective reserves of grain, public accumulation funds, production materials, production funds, seeds, feed, etc., must not be distributed to community members for consumption under any pretext. Public welfare funds must not be used at will without the discussion of the community members. We must resolutely defend the socialist collective economy and wage an irreconcilable struggle against counter-revolutionary economism. The waste of labor is the greatest waste, and we must reasonably arrange labor and fully tap the enthusiasm and initiative of the community members. Revolutionary mass organizations in the countryside must not appoint full-time, non-production personnel. We oppose using production time for debates or connections. Cadres at all levels must participate in collective production labor.

	(8) **Learn from the PLA and fight side by side with the PLA.** Currently, the soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are going to various places in the suburbs to actively support the great struggle of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" in the countryside. This is Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's affectionate care for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is an important guarantee for our victory in both revolution and production. We must seriously learn from the PLA, learning their precious experience of hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and vigorously carrying out thought revolutionization; learning their noble quality of wholeheartedly serving the people; learning their revolutionary spirit of overcoming all difficulties and fearing no sacrifice and their fine tradition of hard work and plain living. Whoever dares to direct their spears at the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, we will fight to the end with them! We hope that all militia will take the Chinese People's Liberation Army as an example, adhere to the policy of "combining labor with military affairs," and achieve the realization of organization, politics, and military affairs. We must play the role of a shock brigade in "seizing the revolution and promoting production."

	(9) **Strengthen proletarian dictatorship.** All poor and lower-middle peasants must be vigilant and, in accordance with the "Several Regulations on Strengthening Public Security Work During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, strengthen security work. In the countryside, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are the objects of dictatorship and are only allowed to labor and reform under the supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants, not allowed to make trouble. We must not allow them to rebel against the proletariat, and we must not allow them to rebel against the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must not allow cadres who took the capitalist road and were removed from their positions during the "Four Cleanups" movement to seek revenge and restoration. Those who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production must be punished by law.

	(10) **Study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, is the key to "seizing the revolution and promoting production."** People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. During the busy spring plowing period, we must prioritize the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and focus on the "use" of them. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and all work. We must establish and strengthen the team of political instructors and do a good job in political propaganda and mobilization in various forms on the front line of production. We must be good at grasping living thoughts, using rest time in the fields to study "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with problems in mind, and solving problems in a targeted manner. We must pay attention to setting examples, selecting models, praising good deeds, and exchanging experiences and feelings of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during production intervals through methods such as holding "experience-sharing meetings." We must create a strong political atmosphere and high morale. It is wrong to think that production is too busy to study and to oppose production and study. The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels must take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, seriously study Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self," establish the "public," and carry out thought revolutionization. Especially cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying and applying. The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and All Levels of Cadres in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country" is Chairman Mao's latest and highest instruction. Every poor and lower-middle peasant and revolutionary cadre must implement the spirit of this document in their actual actions and transform the great spiritual power of Mao Zedong Thought into tremendous material power. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will turn the countryside into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    北京市贫下中农代表会议通过决议
    不折不扣地执行毛主席的伟大指示争取革命生产双胜利
    新华社二十日讯　北京市贫下中农代表会议在三月十九日通过决议，全文如下：
    我们来自北京郊区十三个县（区）的贫下中农代表，在最最敬爱的领袖毛主席身边隆重集会，热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，热烈欢呼全市贫下中农的大联合、大团结、大会师！这是一个胜利的大会、团结的大会，是“抓革命，促生产”的誓师大会！
    会议表达郊区贫下中农的共同愿望：衷心地祝福我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！
    到会的代表一致表示决心：永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好社员。
    在会上，代表们回顾了前一阶段郊区农村无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程。在无产阶级文化大革命中，郊区广大贫下中农，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造了坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子的反，煞住了反革命经济主义的黑风，迎头痛击了阶级敌人妄图推翻“四清”成果的反革命逆流。郊区农村出现了一派大好的革命形势。不久以前发布的《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，更使我们受到了巨大的鼓舞。一个“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮正在郊区农村蓬勃开展起来。
    会议指出：当前郊区农村的阶级斗争仍然十分激烈。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派同没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子相勾结，用各种方式破坏社会主义集体经济，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。严重的阶级斗争摆在我们面前，我们务必不要麻痹大意，不能松懈自己的斗志。为了全面地不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，争取革命和生产的双胜利，特作如下决议：
      （一）高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义革命进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们要按照毛主席和党中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的各项指示和规定，充分依靠群众，放手发动群众，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。长期以来，旧北京市委、市人委所执行的反革命修正主义路线，顽固地对抗毛主席的革命路线，疯狂地反对伟大的毛泽东思想，疯狂地破坏农村社会主义教育运动。这条反革命修正主义路线同郊区农村走资本主义道路的当权派以及地、富、反、坏、右分子相结合，干的尽是反革命复辟的事。我们要彻底肃清它的一切流毒。
    为了彻底肃清旧北京市委、市人委反革命修正主义路线的一切流毒，为了完成一斗、二批、三改的任务，为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们要彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，要坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。当前，有那么一小撮人继续顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，实行反攻倒算。这一小撮人恶毒地歪曲革命的“三结合”的方针，为走资本主义道路的当权派涂脂抹粉，鸣冤叫屈，妄图实行反革命复辟；这一小撮人抓住无产阶级革命派的缺点大作文章，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，妄图推翻无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大成果。这一小撮人一直把矛头指向以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，指向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中央文化革命小组。但是，不管前进路上遇到怎样的惊涛骇浪和急流险滩，我们贫下中农永远跟着毛主席闹革命，坚决拥护毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席的正确领导，坚决拥护中央文化革命小组的正确领导。在我们贫下中农的眼里，资产阶级反动路线是一只过街的老鼠。我们要把资产阶级反动路线彻底打倒，让它永世不得翻身！
    我们贫下中农一定要清楚地认识到：在从资本主义过渡到共产主义的整个历史时期，始终存在着无产阶级同资产阶级之间的斗争，存在着社会主义道路同资本主义道路之间的斗争，存在着资产阶级同无产阶级之间的夺权斗争。我们一定要在文化大革命中自觉地参加批判资产阶级的斗争，一定要把社会主义革命推进到完全彻底的胜利。我们贫下中农从自己的切身经历中，深深地懂得：社会主义道路是我们唯一的光明大道。我们只有一个心眼，就是要沿着这条光明大道走到底，彻底地挖掉修正主义的根子，堵塞资本主义复辟的道路，使我们的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
      （二）搞好春耕生产，为夺取全年农业大丰收打下坚实的基础。搞好春耕生产是执行“抓革命，促生产”方针的一个重要环节。我们要充分重视打好春耕生产这一仗。当前，生产领导班子，要立即发动社员群众充分讨论种植计划和增产措施，迅速落实到地块；要不误时机的适时播种；特别要抓紧返青小麦的管理，适时施肥浇水；要尽量多抢种一些早熟作物；去冬以来，雨雪稀少，旱象严重，要加快水利设施的建设，搞好水利工程配套，开展抗旱保墒的活动，为春播工作做好准备；在兴修水利时，要与防涝相结合，做好防涝准备。要加强农业科学技术管理，开展科学实验活动，做好病虫害的防治工作。当前农活十分紧迫，广大民兵，各革命组织，要迅速行动起来，妇女劳动力也要“杀”上火线，集中一切人力物力搞好春耕生产。农村文化大革命要按中央规定，在生产空闲时间进行，白天搞生产，晚上闹革命。任何误生产去抓革命，或只生产不抓革命的作法，都是错误的。贫下中农和全体社员要提高出勤率，遵守劳动纪律，提高作业质量，又快又好地完成生产任务。要坚决同违反劳动纪律的行为作斗争。
      （三）建立和健全生产领导班子。郊区各县（区）要认真学习怀柔县的经验，建立和健全一个由革命群众组织代表、革命干部和当地驻军代表组成的三结合的抓革命、促生产第一线指挥部。我们要坚决执行中共中央关于春耕期间生产大队和生产队不夺权的指示，已经夺权的并经革命群众和上级同意的生产大队和生产队的领导班子，要切实挑起革命和生产两副重担，发动群众，搞好生产。在领导班子软弱或涣散了的生产大队和生产队，贫下中农积极分子和革命干部要挺身而出组成临时的领导班子。各级领导班子，要用毛泽东思想挂帅调动一切积极因素，把生产切实抓起来。在生产班子建立以后，我们贫下中农要积极给以支持，服从领导，听从指挥，不要冲击生产班子的工作。
      （四）学大寨人，走大寨路，建设大寨式的新农村。“农业学大寨”是毛主席提出的伟大号召，是贯彻执行鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的一个重大措施。走大寨的道路，就是用毛泽东思想改造农村，建设农村的必由之路。我们郊区的贫下中农要以大寨为榜样，发扬大寨艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，开展比、学、赶、帮的群众运动，让大寨的红花在郊区农村遍地开放。
      （五）农村中革命组织的建立，必须有利于无产阶级革命派的大联合，有利于“抓革命，促生产”，有利于本单位的斗、批、改，有利于各组织成员的思想革命化。在农村，一般地应以生产队为单位建立战斗队（组），在大队范围内建立联合的革命群众组织。不要跨队建立革命组织，更不要跨行业加入工人、学生或其他系统的群众组织。在跨队跨系统的群众组织撤销以后，仍然可以利用生产的空闲时间在队与队之间进行革命串连。
    （六）正确地对待干部。我们贫下中农一定要按照毛主席的教导，用阶级分析的方法，全面考察干部，正确地估价农村的干部队伍。我们认为农村干部（包括正职），大多数是好的和比较好的，对于犯有错误的干部，应该本着毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针对他们进行批评和教育，帮助他们改正错误。只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。另一方面，我们也衷心地希望，各级干部听毛主席的话，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，信任群众，依靠群众，深入生产第一线，和群众打成一片，充分发扬民主作风，遇事和群众商量。我们希望，犯有错误的干部，去掉“私”字，放下包袱，在生产中经受考验，积极领导好生产，接受群众的批评和帮助，将功补过。只要他们这样做，我们贫下中农就欢迎就支持。
    （七）坚决响应毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，坚决执行毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针。各公社、生产大队和生产队，要尽量减少非生产性开支和行政费用。在按规定完成国家征购任务和税收任务的前提下，要留有余地，适当增加集体的资金积累和粮食储备。凡属集体的储备粮、公积金、生产资料、生产资金以及种子、饲料等等，一律不得以任何借口分给社员消费。公益金未经社员群众讨论，也不得随意动用。要坚决保卫社会主义的集体经济，同反革命经济主义进行不调和的斗争。劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费，一定要合理安排劳力，充分发挥社员的积极性和自觉性。农村中的革命群众组织，不得配备专职的脱产人员。反对占用生产时间开辩论会或进行串连。各级干部要参加集体生产劳动。
    （八）向解放军学习，和解放军并肩战斗。目前，中国人民解放军的指战员，分赴郊区各地，积极支援农村“抓革命，促生产”的伟大斗争。这是毛主席和党中央对我们贫下中农的亲切关怀，这是我们夺取革命和生产双胜利的重要保证。我们要认真地向解放军学习，学习他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、狠抓思想革命化的宝贵经验；学习他们全心全意为人民服务的高尚品质；学习他们排除万难、不怕牺牲的革命精神和艰苦朴素的优良传统。谁胆敢把矛头指向光荣的中国人民解放军，我们就和他拚到底！我们希望全体民兵，以中国人民解放军为榜样，坚持“劳武结合”的方针，做到组织、政治、军事三落实，要在“抓革命，促生产”中发挥突击队的作用。
      （九）大力加强无产阶级专政。全体贫下中农要提高警惕，要按照中共中央、国务院《关于在无产阶级文化大革命中加强公安工作的若干规定》，加强安全保卫工作。农村中，地、富、反、坏、右分子是专政的对象，只许他们在贫下中农监督下老老实实地劳动改造，不许他们乱说乱动。绝对不能允许他们造无产阶级的反，绝对不能允许他们造贫下中农的反。绝对不能允许在“四清”运动中下台的走资本主义道路的干部反攻倒算。凡破坏无产阶级文化大革命和破坏生产者，必须依法惩处。
    （十）活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，是“抓革命，促生产”的关键。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，是阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动取得胜利的根本保证。在春耕大忙期间，要把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，在“用”字上狠下功夫。要用毛泽东思想去统帅生产和统帅一切工作。要建立和健全政治辅导员的队伍，在生产第一线上利用各种形式做好政治宣传鼓动工作。要善于抓住活思想，利用田间地头的休息时间带着问题学习《毛主席语录》，有的放矢地解决问题。要注意抓典型，树标兵，表扬好人好事，在生产间隙时间用召开“讲用会”等办法，交流活学活用毛主席著作的经验和体会。要把政治空气搞得浓浓的，士气鼓得高高的。认为生产一忙就没有时间学习，把生产和学习对立起来，是错误的。贫下中农和各级干部，要把“老三篇”当作座右铭，认真地学习毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞好思想革命化。特别是各级干部要带头学，带头用。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，是毛主席的最新最高指示，每个贫下中农和革命干部一定要把这一文件的精神落实到实际行动中去，把毛泽东思想的伟大精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。经过文化大革命，我们要把农村变成毛泽东思想的大学校。
