	Henan Welcomes the Rain
	Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 17th - In recent days, the long-droughted Henan Province has experienced widespread spring rain. This rain began on the 15th and covered a broad area with substantial rainfall. By 5 AM today, the province had received between 20 to 30 millimeters of rain, with some areas receiving 50 to 60 millimeters. This rainfall has alleviated or eased the drought conditions in some regions, benefiting the greening of wheat and the sowing of spring crops.

	After the rain, the broad masses of commune members have responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They are currently engaged in activities such as plowing and harrowing to retain moisture, fertilizing, and strengthening wheat field management. They are determined to channel the boundless enthusiasm unleashed during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, striving to launch a new high tide in spring farming and production.

    河南喜雨
    新华社郑州十七日电　久旱少雨的河南省连日来普降春雨。这场雨从十五日开始，下的范围较广，雨量较大。截至今天五时止，全省降水量一般在二十到三十毫米，部分地区达五十到六十毫米。这次降雨，使一些地区的旱象得到解除或趋于缓和，对于小麦返青和春播作物播种都有好处。
    雨后，广大社员积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，正在进行耙耱保墒和积肥施肥、加强麦田管理等活动，决心把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上去，掀起春耕生产新高潮。
