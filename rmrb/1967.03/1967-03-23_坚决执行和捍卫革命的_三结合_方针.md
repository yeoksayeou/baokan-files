The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage where revolutionary masses unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. At this crucial moment, Chairman Mao has put forward that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy must be implemented. This means establishing a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ—the Revolutionary Committee—composed of representatives from genuine revolutionary mass organizations, local garrisoned People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres.

The revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy is a policy of Marxism-Leninism. Implementing this policy is the political and organizational guarantee for the victory of the power seizure struggle by the revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses, and his great directive to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, is a great trust, a great inspiration, and a great spur for our army.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally founded and leads the People's Liberation Army of China, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition and has always enjoyed high prestige among the people. Our army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the backing of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. In the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, our People's Liberation Army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement and defend the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy, truly become a strong pillar of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and create new achievements for the great cause of the proletarian revolution.

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Solving the question of relying on whom, uniting with whom, and striking at whom is the key to correctly implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy.

In the face of extremely sharp and complex class struggles, we must do thorough investigative work, understand the situation, and use Mao Zedong Thought to conduct class analysis and distinguish between friends and enemies. The leading cadres of local garrisons must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, put politics in command, go among the masses, personally contact various sides, and conduct in-depth investigations and research. Only in this way can we correctly identify the revolutionary leftists, recognize which are genuine revolutionary mass organizations and which are genuine revolutionary cadres, and form a revolutionary union with them in the struggle. Only in this way can we grasp the situation of the struggle and make correct decisions at the right time.

"The masses are the real heroes." The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations are the foundation of the temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and their representatives have made great achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They embody the revolutionary direction. We must resolutely stand on their side, support them, rely on them, and help them. The most important thing is to support them politically and ideologically. We must help genuine revolutionary mass organizations to develop and grow rapidly, help them educate themselves, strengthen revolutionary construction, break with selfishness, and promote the great unity of revolutionary mass organizations under the premise of a consistent revolutionary direction. We must guide them to correctly understand and implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, specifically help them to analyze cadres comprehensively, so that they can correctly treat cadres, consciously support revolutionary cadres, welcome cadres who are willing to correct their mistakes to come forward, and fight side by side with them. We must conduct thorough propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses, propagate the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, propagate the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and propagate "grasp revolution, promote production," so that the Party's policies are deeply understood and grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. In places where conditions are not yet ripe, the army must actively and proactively help the revolutionary masses to create conditions for implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

Revolutionary cadres are the core and backbone of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and play a major role in seizing and holding power. The leading organs and comrades of local garrisons must actively and proactively assist the revolutionary masses in understanding the situation of cadres and doing cadre work. Long-term adherents to the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao are precious assets of the Party and the people. We must resolutely support them and do everything possible to help them carry out their work and shoulder the leadership responsibilities. For cadres who have made mistakes, we must do political and ideological work through various channels, help them understand the profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement, correct their mistakes, put down their burdens, draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line, and bravely stand on the side of the revolutionary masses and on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. At the same time, we must be highly vigilant against those who insist on the capitalist reactionary stance, using "coming out" as a cover to "break in." We must expose and smash their counter-revolutionary restoration plots in time.

The implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy marks the downfall of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. However, they will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. They will still collude with the ghosts and snakes in society and struggle desperately. These elements fear and hate the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy to the core. They will always use various tricks to deceive and incite some uninformed masses, attempting to sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination to save their failing fate. We must resolutely smash their plots. In the struggle to smash their plots, we must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. For those who have been deceived, we must conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, and patient and thorough ideological work, explain the Party's policies, raise their awareness, and bring them back to the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary "three-in-one" combination is a combination under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and on the basis of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, not a combination without principles, and even less a combination of conciliation and compromise. We must pay high attention to this. We must be vigilant and guard against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, using the banner of "three-in-one" combination to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. Smashing their plots is a major responsibility for our People's Liberation Army.

Without Mao Zedong Thought as the unified ideological foundation, it is impossible to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. We must propagate, implement, and defend the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics. Whether we do the work of the masses or the work of cadres, the most fundamental thing is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various ideological and practical problems. We must learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. We must, within the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, according to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen ideological and organizational revolutionization. Only in this way can we successfully carry out the power seizure struggle and make sure that Party power, state power, economic power, and cultural power are truly in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The power seizure struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat puts forward higher and stricter requirements for our army. In this new great struggle, we must fully play our role and fulfill our responsibilities. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously and diligently learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must regard this struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines as the best classroom for learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works, closely combine the situation and tasks of the struggle, combine living thoughts, learn with questions in mind, and focus on the "use" of knowledge. We must change our worldview, improve our policy level, and strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. Only when we truly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we correctly implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy, correctly implement and defend the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, overcome various difficulties, smash various countercurrents, and withstand various tests.

We must humbly learn from the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from the revolutionary youngsters and revolutionary cadres. The more the Party and the masses trust us, the more we must be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, consult with the masses on matters, and learn from the masses. If we have shortcomings or make mistakes, we must bravely accept criticism and correct them. We must constantly summarize experiences, be good at learning from struggles in struggles, and learn to swim while swimming.

Let us, under the great and invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite with and fight together with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, strive for the implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination policy, and strive for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Let us strive to complete the glorious strategic tasks entrusted to our army by the Party and the people, and raise the revolutionary construction of the troops to a new level in the struggle!

### 坚决执行和捍卫革命的“三结合”方针

    坚决执行和捍卫革命的“三结合”方针
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，进入了无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的新阶段。在这个关键时刻，毛主席提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针。这就是由真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表和革命领导干部，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——革命委员会。革命的“三结合”的方针，是马克思列宁主义的方针，实行这个方针是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争取得胜利的政治保证和组织保证。
    毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，关于实行革命的“三结合”的伟大指示，对我们军队是巨大的信任，巨大的鼓舞，也是巨大的鞭策。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导的中国人民解放军，有着光荣的革命传统，在人民群众中一向享有崇高的威信。我们军队是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级革命派的靠山。在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中，我们人民解放军必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行和捍卫革命的“三结合”的方针，真正成为革命的“三结合”的强大支柱，为伟大的无产阶级革命事业创立新功。
      “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”解决依靠谁、团结谁、打击谁的问题，是我军正确贯彻执行革命的“三结合”方针的关键。
    在阶级斗争十分尖锐、十分复杂的情况下，我们必须做好深入细致的调查工作，摸清情况，运用毛泽东思想去作阶级分析，分清敌我。各地驻军的领导干部，必须按照毛主席的指示，政治挂帅，到群众里面去，亲自同各方面进行接触，深入地进行调查研究。这样，才能正确地识别革命左派，认清哪些是真正的革命群众组织，哪些是真正的革命领导干部，在斗争中同他们形成革命的联合。也只有这样，才能紧紧把握斗争的形势，不失时机地作出正确的决策。
      “群众是真正的英雄”。广大革命群众和革命的群众组织，是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础。广大的无产阶级革命派和他们的代表人物，在无产阶级文化大革命中，立下了丰功伟绩。他们体现了革命的大方向。我们要坚决站在他们一边，坚决支持他们，依靠他们，帮助他们。最重要的是从政治上、思想上支持他们。要帮助真正的革命群众组织迅速地发展壮大起来，帮助他们自己教育自己，加强革命化建设，破私立公，促进各革命群众组织在大方向一致的前提下，实现大联合。要引导他们正确地理解和执行毛主席制定的干部政策，具体帮助他们对干部进行全面的分析，使他们能够正确地对待干部，自觉地支持革命的领导干部，欢迎愿意并且实行改正错误的干部站出来，同他们并肩战斗。要对广大群众深入细致地宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级革命派大联合，宣传革命的“三结合”，宣传“抓革命，促生产”，使党的方针政策深入人心，为广大革命群众所掌握。在条件还不够成熟的地方，军队要积极主动地去帮助革命群众，为实现革命的“三结合”创造条件。
    革命的领导干部，是革命的“三结合”的核心和骨干，对于夺权和掌权，都有着重大的作用。各地驻军的领导机关和领导同志，要积极主动地协助革命群众，弄清干部的情况，做好干部的工作。长期坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，是党和人民的宝贵财富，我们要坚决支持，尽一切努力帮助他们开展工作，挑起领导的重担。对于犯了错误的干部，我们就要通过各种途径，做好他们的政治思想工作，帮助他们认清无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义，正确对待革命的群众运动，改正错误，放下包袱，同资产阶级反动路线划清界线，勇敢地站到革命群众一边来，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来，挺起腰杆闹革命。同时，我们也必须高度警惕那些坚持资产阶级反动立场的人，以“站出来”为名，行“打进来”之实。对他们的反革命复辟阴谋，必须及时揭露，坚决粉碎。
    革命的“三结合”方针的贯彻执行，标志着党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的垮台。但是，他们决不会自动退出历史舞台。他们还会同社会上的牛鬼蛇神互相勾结，进行垂死的挣扎。这些家伙，对革命的“三结合”的方针，怕得要死，恨之入骨。他们总是要施展各种阴谋诡计，迷惑和煽动一部分不明真相的群众，妄图破坏革命的“三结合”，以挽救他们失败的命运。我们要坚决地粉碎他们这一小撮人的这种阴谋。在粉碎他们的阴谋的斗争过程中，我们要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。对于那些受蒙蔽的群众，要进行广泛深入的宣传教育，耐心细致的思想工作，讲明党的政策，提高他们的觉悟，使他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    革命的“三结合”，是在毛泽东思想指导下、在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线基础上的结合，不是无原则的结合，更不能搞调和主义、折中主义。我们必须高度注意这一点。我们必须提高警惕，严防党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，打着“三结合”的旗子搞反革命复辟。粉碎他们的这种阴谋，我们人民解放军负有重大责任。
    没有毛泽东思想作为统一的思想基础，就不可能实现革命的“三结合”。我们宣传、执行和捍卫革命的“三结合”的方针，必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治。我们无论做群众的工作，做干部的工作，最根本的都是宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想去回答和解决各种思想问题和实际问题。我们要同革命群众和革命干部一起活学活用毛主席著作。要在革命的“三结合”的内部，按照“团结——批评——团结”的原则，经常地开展批评和自我批评，加强思想革命化和组织革命化。这样，才能够胜利地进行夺权斗争，使党权、政权、财权、文权确实掌握在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命派手里。
    无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，对我们军队提出了更高、更严的要求。我们要在这场新的伟大斗争中，充分发挥自己的作用、尽自己的责任，就一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真地、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作。要把这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战，作为活学活用毛主席著作最好的课堂，紧紧结合斗争的形势和任务，结合活思想，带着问题学，在“用”字上狠下功夫，改造世界观，提高政策水平，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。只有自己真正用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能正确地执行和捍卫毛主席制定的革命的“三结合”的方针，正确地执行和捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，才能克服各种困难，粉碎各种逆流，经受住各种考验。
    我们要虚心地向工人阶级和贫下中农学习，向革命小将和革命干部学习。党和群众越是信赖我们，我们越是要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，遇事和群众商量，向群众请教。有了缺点，或者犯了错误，要勇于接受批评，认真改正。要不断总结经验，善于在斗争中学习斗争，在游泳中学会游泳。
    让我们在伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，同广大革命群众和革命干部，紧密地团结在一起，战斗在一起，为贯彻执行革命的“三结合”方针，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利而奋斗！为圆满完成党和人民交给我军的光荣的战略任务，并在斗争中把部队的革命化建设提高到一个新水平而奋斗！　（三月二十三日）
