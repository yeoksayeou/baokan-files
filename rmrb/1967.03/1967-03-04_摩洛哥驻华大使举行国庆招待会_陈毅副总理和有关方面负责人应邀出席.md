Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhou Jianren, along with other relevant officials, attended the reception at the ambassador's invitation.

Ambassador Filali spoke first at the reception. He talked about the long-standing relationship between Morocco and China. He expressed his belief that this mutually beneficial relationship will continue to strengthen.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also spoke at the reception. He said that China and Morocco are friendly countries. Like many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, China and Morocco currently face the common tasks of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, safeguarding national independence, and developing national economies.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who love freedom and independence, are all fighting against imperialism. ... Imperialists hope that we will not unite, not cooperate, not be friendly. We must respond to them by strengthening unity, friendship, and cooperation, and we must make their plots completely fail.' The Chinese people resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite with all countries suffering from imperialist aggression, control, interference, and bullying, and on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, further cooperate and support each other."

Also in attendance were envoys from various countries to China.

    陈毅副总理在招待会上讲话。他说，中国、摩洛哥是两个友好的国家。中摩两国和亚非拉许多国家一样，目前都面临着反帝反殖、维护民族独立、发展民族经济的共同任务。
    陈毅副总理说，毛主席教导我们说：“我们亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好自由和独立的人民，都在反对殖民主义。……殖民主义者希望我们不团结，不合作，不友好。我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。”中国人民坚决按照毛主席的教导，同一切受帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家联合起来，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，进一步互相合作，互相支持。应邀出席招待会的，还有各国驻中国的使节。
