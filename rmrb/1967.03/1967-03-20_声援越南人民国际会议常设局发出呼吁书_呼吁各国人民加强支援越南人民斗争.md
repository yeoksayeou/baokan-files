The Steering Committee of the International Conference in Support of the Vietnamese People in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the defense of peace has issued an appeal to the peoples of all countries, calling on them to further support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and condemn the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam.

The appeal, which was issued on the eve of the "March 19" National Day of Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism in Vietnam, exposes in detail the crimes of the U.S. imperialists who are escalating and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.

The appeal says that in the face of the extremely grave measures taken by the U.S. government to further escalate the war, the Steering Committee calls on all international organizations and the peoples of the world to strongly denounce and condemn the war plots and actions of the U.S. imperialists, to intensify the struggle to stop the criminal hands of the U.S. imperialists, and to strengthen support and solidarity with the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

The appeal calls on the peoples of all countries to strongly support the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to demand that the United States stop the war of aggression against Vietnam, unconditionally halt the bombing and other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam, recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, and allow the Vietnamese people to settle their own internal affairs.

The appeal concludes: "The 30 million Vietnamese people are united in their resolve not to yield to violence, to fight back against the U.S. aggressors, to regain their national rights, and to defend the peace of Asia and the world. The more the U.S. imperialists escalate and expand their war of aggression, the more disastrous their defeat will be. The Vietnamese people have already won victories, are winning victories now, and will surely win complete victory in the future."
