After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in a magnificent and vigorous manner, due to my own failure to study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly and my worldview not being fundamentally transformed, and because I was deceived and misled by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, I followed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, committing errors in direction and line. It was not until the publication of the editorial in the 13th issue of *Red Flag* magazine in October last year that I gradually became aware of my mistakes. Under the personal guidance and inspiration of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, with the help of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, I was finally rescued from the quagmire of error and returned to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, returning to the embrace of the Party and the people. Every time I think of this, I feel both deeply remorseful and extremely joyful.

I hurriedly returned to Qingdao from the Four Cleanups work team in Dezhou on August 21 last year. At that time, I was filled with enthusiasm to participate in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, upon returning to Qingdao, I saw that some people were not enthusiastic and jubilant about the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but were terrified of the students' revolutionary actions. They harbored evil intentions, saying things like "Qingdao Medical College is being manipulated by bad elements who want to overthrow the Municipal Party Committee," and were in a panic as if a great disaster was about to befall them. Because I did not understand the Cultural Revolution well and had many old ideas, I found it unpleasant to see students from the Medical College distributing leaflets exposing problems within the Municipal Party Committee, and I harbored some doubts about such actions. Therefore, I believed the rumors spread by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Municipal Party Committee and supported their erroneous actions of suppressing the student movement and reversing the direction of the struggle, leading to the reactionary incident of the "August 25" suppression of the student movement. After this incident, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, under the pretext of "protecting cadres" and "saving cadres," instructed the Municipal Party Committee to cover up the truth of the "August 25" incident in every possible way, attempting to keep the broad masses and cadres in the dark. With their encouragement and support, they created another reactionary incident of suppressing the student movement on "September 1." Many revolutionary students were attacked, and many revolutionary comrades were persecuted, casting a white terror over Qingdao. Former Vice Mayor of Qingdao, Wang Xiaoyu, who had always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fought unyieldingly against the bourgeois reactionary line since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was severely struck down at this time.

After the reactionary incident of "September 1," a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee mobilized a large number of cadres to Qingdao, changing tactics but continuing to stubbornly push the bourgeois reactionary line. They pretended to support but actually suppressed revolutionary teachers and students, divided and disintegrated revolutionary mass organizations, and used the organs of dictatorship to collect black materials, preparing to "settle accounts later." During this period, due to my blind faith in these people and lack of vigilance against their counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, I also made some mistakes.

After the "August 25" incident in Qingdao, I had long harbored passive thoughts of waiting to be criticized. I thought: they suppressed the student movement, and I did not resist but cast a vote of approval, causing the serious "August 25" incident, for which I was responsible, and the masses would not let me off. During the "September 1" reactionary incident, although I tried to stop the masses who were not clear about the truth from taking to the streets in large-scale demonstrations, I was always afraid that someone would suspect me. After the "September 1" reactionary incident, under the command of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Party Work Group, I blindly obeyed and made more mistakes, compounding my errors. Broad revolutionary teachers and students, how could they forgive me? Therefore, my mental burden grew heavier, and I spent my days just getting by, with no heart for work. After the publication of the editorial in the 13th issue of *Red Flag* magazine during the National Day holiday last year, it sounded an alarm for me. The editorial pointed out: "The Party Central Committee believes that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comrades who have made errors in direction and line should face up to their errors, correct their errors, and return to the correct stand and line, rather than develop to the point of opposing the Party." At the same time, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, and errors that we cannot abandon?" I repeatedly engaged in inner struggle. I thought, the old society made it impossible for my whole family to live, it was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me. Now that I have made mistakes, should I just go on like this and develop to the point of opposing the Party? No! I must resolutely correct my mistakes, return to the correct stand, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, I actively participated in the work of rehabilitating the wronged comrades. During the rehabilitation process, I heard many wronged comrades denounce the bourgeois reactionary line, which deeply moved and educated me. Sometimes I would shed tears with them, gradually establishing class feelings with these comrades, and my stand began to gradually change. Facts educated me that as long as I could bravely admit and correct my mistakes, the masses were reasonable and could be forgiven. This made me gradually build confidence in correcting my mistakes. This was my first step in correcting my mistakes. However, to thoroughly correct my mistakes and regain the trust of the masses, I had to go through painful inner struggles. In late October last year, revolutionary comrades extended their warm hands, hoping that I would stand up and expose the criminal activities of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee in Qingdao. Due to the word "fear" still lingering in my mind, I had various concerns. I thought that the problems within the Provincial Party Committee were all discussed in Party meetings, and publicly exposing them might violate organizational discipline, and I might be held accountable, and criticized later in the movement, so I hesitated and could not make up my mind. When I saw revolutionary comrades, I always stammered, and my heart was not at ease. In November, seeing that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee continued to cover up the truth of the Qingdao issue in their self-criticisms, deceiving Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, I felt that if I went on like this, without reflecting the situation to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, I would be letting down Chairman Mao and the Party. Thus, I exposed their problems to the Party Central Committee. However, at that time, my mind was still constrained by the idea of "distinguishing between insiders and outsiders," and I did not publicly stand up to expose them.

The facts were the opposite, as Chairman Mao taught us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee not only had no intention of repenting but also set the tone for themselves, portraying themselves as people within the proletarian headquarters, continuing to deceive the masses. Some places within the Party, a handful of capitalist-roaders took advantage of this, launching another new counterattack. Just in December last year, when the total attack on the bourgeois reactionary line was about to begin, the sky over Qingdao was filled with dark clouds. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, together with some deceived masses, launched an attack on Vice Mayor Wang Xiaoyu of Qingdao, attempting to strike at the revolutionary leftists and make a desperate struggle. At this critical moment of struggle, I had a fierce inner struggle: should I publicly stand up and thoroughly expose and criticize the problems of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees together with the proletarian revolutionary faction? Or should I retreat and avoid this sharp struggle? Publicly standing up, I was afraid of being called a "political opportunist," and I was also afraid that revolutionary comrades would not trust me. These private thoughts tormented me, making me feel very miserable. At this time, I reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." When I couldn't sleep, I compared myself with Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune, feeling that my private thoughts were very shameful. I also confided in Comrade Wang Xiaoyu, who encouraged me, finally making me break through the heavy pressure and resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, publicly exposing the problems of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees. At the meeting on January 6 to criticize the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees for pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, I issued my statement, completely breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely stood up to fight against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees. After my statement was issued, it was immediately warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary situation in Qingdao is getting better and better. Under the banner of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary faction achieved great unity, and on January 22, they seized the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee. The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee was born in victory. This is a great victory for the thought of Mao Zedong, and it is a great victory for the revolutionary faction of Qingdao to unite with the broad masses and, after arduous and tortuous struggles, seize power. I unhesitatingly firmly supported the power seizure struggle of the great alliance of the Qingdao revolutionary faction.

In the process of the revolutionary faction's united power seizure struggle, the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee attached great importance to the role of revolutionary cadres in the power seizure struggle; after the victory of the power seizure struggle, it also seriously implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, adopting the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" for cadres who made mistakes. The Municipal Revolutionary Committee quickly absorbed me into the committee and gave me strong support for the work I was responsible for. This made me very grateful and greatly inspired. I must, under the leadership of the Party, follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, unite with the broad revolutionary comrades and revolutionary masses, and firmly hold power for the proletariat.

I deeply feel that the fundamental reason for my mistakes is that I did not study Chairman Mao's works well. From this period of work, I further realized that Chairman Mao's books must be read, and one cannot do without them, not even for a moment. I must seriously follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the thought of Mao Zedong to transform myself, thoroughly break down the "self" and firmly establish the "public," and resolutely abandon all private thoughts, thoroughly transform my worldview, pass the socialist test, follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution, and strive for the proletarian revolutionary cause to the end!

In this short period, I personally felt that studying, working, and living together with the proletarian revolutionary faction is indescribably joyful. I want to learn from the revolutionary youngsters, help each other, truly put down my airs, and humbly learn from their high-spirited revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and venture under the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought; I also want to introduce my little experience learned in the revolution to them, raise our standards together, and firmly fight against those bad thoughts and bad styles of looking down on revolutionary youngsters and using their shortcomings to make trouble for them in work, actively protect their revolutionary enthusiasm, support them, and assist them. Under the brilliant illumination of the great thought of Mao Zedong, together with them, we will firmly hold power and use power well.

The current situation in Qingdao is very good. Both revolution and production have achieved great results, the proletarian revolutionary faction is becoming stronger and stronger, and the proletarian dictatorship is becoming more and more consolidated. Production is getting better month by month this year. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, together with the broad revolutionary comrades and revolutionary masses, better implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and strive for double victories in revolution and production!

Finally, let me shout:

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    我是怎样回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线来的
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，由于我自己没有很好地学习毛主席著作，世界观没有得到彻底改造，由于受了前山东省委和前青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的欺骗蒙蔽，在前段无产阶级文化大革命中，执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了方向路线错误。去年十月《红旗》杂志十三期社论发表以后，我才逐步觉悟过来。在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对犯错误的干部亲切教导和感召之下，在革命群众和革命干部的帮助之下，终于把我从错误的泥坑中挽救出来，使我回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，使我回到了党和人民的怀抱。每想到这里，我既感到十分沉痛，又感到非常愉快。
    我是去年八月二十一日匆匆忙忙从德州四清工作团调回青岛的。当时，我怀着满腔的热情回来参加这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。但我回到青岛以后，看到某些人对轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命不是兴高采烈、欢欣鼓舞，而是对学生的革命行动怕得要死。他们心怀鬼胎，说什么“青岛医学院背后有坏人操纵，他们想搞垮市委”，慌慌张张，似乎大难临头。因为我自己对文化大革命很不理解，思想上有很多旧框框，看到医学院同学散发传单揭发市委的问题时，觉得看不惯，对这种行动也产生了某些怀疑。因此，对市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所散布的谣言，信以为真，赞同了他们压制学生运动、扭转斗争大方向的错误做法，造成了“八·二五”镇压学生运动的反动事件。这次事件以后，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，借口“爱护干部”“挽救干部”，指示市委千方百计地掩盖“八·二五”事件的真相，妄图使广大群众、广大干部继续受蒙蔽，并且在他们的纵容和支持之下，又制造了“九·一”镇压学生运动的反动事件。大批革命的同学遭到围攻，许多革命的同志遭受迫害，白色恐怖笼罩了青岛市。无产阶级文化大革命以来，一直站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚持不屈地同资产阶级反动路线进行斗争的前青岛市副市长王效禹同志，就在这个时候遭到严重打击。
    “九·一”反动事件发生以后，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，调动了大批干部来到青岛，分兵把口，改换了另一种形式，继续顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线。他们对革命师生假支持、真压制，对革命的群众组织分化瓦解，并且动用专政机关，搜集黑材料，准备“秋后算帐”。在这一段时间里，由于自己迷信这些人，对他们的反革命两面手法毫无警惕，因而也作了一些错事。
    青岛“八·二五”事件发生以后，我长时间存在消极等待挨整的思想。自己认为：他们压制学生运动，我没有起来抵制，投了赞成的票，造成了严重的“八·二五”事件，我是有责任的，群众不会放过。在“九·一”反动事件时，对不明真相的群众上街大规模游行，虽然我曾经出来制止过，但也总怕有人怀疑。“九·一”反动事件以后，在省委、省委工作组的指挥下，自己又盲目服从，跟着作了一些错事，使自己错上加错，广大革命师生怎么能对我谅解？因此，自己的思想包袱越来越重，整天应付应付，无心工作。去年国庆节《红旗》杂志十三期社论发表以后，给我敲起了警钟。社论中指出：“党中央认为，在无产阶级文化大革命中，犯过方向错误、路线错误的同志，应当正视自己的错误，改正自己的错误，回到正确立场、正确路线上来，而不要发展到同党对抗的地步。”同时，我反复学习了毛主席的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我反复地进行了思想斗争。我想，旧社会害得我全家没有办法活下去，是党和毛主席救了我。我现在犯了错误，难道就这样走下去，发展到对抗党的地步吗？不能！我一定要坚决纠正自己的错误，回到正确的立场，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。因此，我积极地投入了给受迫害的同志进行平反的工作。在平反过程中，我听了许多受迫害的同志对资产阶级反动路线的控诉，深深地受到感动，深深地受到教育，有时往往和他们一起情不自禁地流出了眼泪，跟这些同志逐步地建立了阶级感情，我的立场也开始逐步转过来了。事实教育了我，只要自己能够勇敢地承认错误，改正错误，群众是通情达理的，是能够取得群众谅解的。这就使我逐步树立了改正错误的信心。这是我改正错误的第一步。但是，要彻底改正错误，重新取得群众的信任，是要经过痛苦的思想斗争的。去年十月下旬，革命派的同志伸出了热情的手，希望我站出来揭发省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在青岛的罪恶活动，由于我头脑里还存在着“怕”字，因而产生了种种顾虑。我认为省委的一些问题，都是在党的会议上讨论的，公开揭发怕违犯组织纪律，怕被记一笔帐，运动后期挨整，于是犹豫徘徊，迟迟下不了决心，见到革命派的同志，老是吞吞吐吐，心里很不坦然。到了十一月，看到省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的检讨中继续掩盖了青岛问题的真相，欺骗了毛主席，欺骗了党中央。我感到这样下去，不向毛主席和党中央反映情况，对不起毛主席，对不起党。于是，我向党中央揭露了他们的问题。但是，那时在我思想上仍然受“内外有别”的束缚，没有公开站起来揭发他们。
    事实恰恰相反，正如毛主席教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不但没有悔改之意，反而给自己定了调子，把自己扮演成无产阶级司令部里的人，继续欺骗群众。有些地方党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，利用这一点，掀起了又一次新的反扑。就在去年的十二月，正要展开对资产阶级反动路线总攻击的时候，青岛市的上空却阴云密布，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，纠合了一些被蒙蔽的群众，发起了对青岛市副市长王效禹同志的围攻，企图以此来打击革命左派，妄想作垂死的挣扎。在这个斗争的关键时刻，我思想上发生了激烈的斗争：是公开站出来和无产阶级革命派一起彻底揭发批判省、市委的问题呢？还是在这场尖锐的斗争面前躲避退缩呢？公开站出来，怕别人说是“政治投机”，还怕革命派的同志不信任。这许多私心杂念纠缠着自己，使我感到非常苦闷。这时，我重温了毛主席的教导：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”在自己睡不着觉的时候，又拿张思德、白求恩来反复对照自己，感到自己的这些私心杂念，非常可耻。我又找到王效禹同志倾吐了我的心情，得到了王效禹同志的鼓励，终于使我冲破了重重的压力，毅然决然地站到无产阶级革命派一边，公开揭发了省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的问题。在今年一月六日批判省、市委推行资产阶级反动路线的大会上，发表了我的声明，彻底同资产阶级反动路线决裂，坚决起来造省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反。我的声明发出以后，立即得到了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    青岛的革命形势越来越好。革命派在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，实现了大联合，在今年一月二十二日，夺取了前青岛市委、市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的党、政、财、文大权。青岛市革命委员会胜利诞生了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是青岛市革命派团结广大群众，经过艰苦曲折的斗争，取得的伟大胜利。我毫不犹豫地坚决支持了青岛市革命派大联合所进行的夺权斗争。
    青岛市革命委员会在无产阶级革命派的联合夺权斗争的过程中，非常重视革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用；在夺权斗争取得胜利以后，又认真贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，对犯错误的干部采取了“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。市革命委员会很快吸收我参加了委员会，并且对我所分工的工作，给予了大力支持。这使我非常感激，受到很大鼓舞。我一定要在党的领导下，按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，和广大革命同志、革命群众团结一致，为无产阶级掌好权。
    我深深地体会到，我犯错误的根本原因，是没有很好学习毛主席著作。从这一段的工作看，更使我进一步认识到，毛主席的书非读不可，不读不行，一时一刻也不能忘记读毛主席的书。我一定认真地遵照毛主席最亲密的战友林彪同志的指示，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想来改造自己，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，决心抛弃一切私心杂念，彻底改造世界观，过好社会主义关，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，为无产阶级革命事业奋斗到底！
    在这短短的时间里，我亲身体会到，和无产阶级革命派学习在一起，工作在一起，生活在一起，有说不出的愉快。我要同革命小将互相学习，互相帮助，真正地放下架子，虚心地学习他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神；我也要把自己在革命中学到的点滴经验介绍给他们，共同提高，并且坚决地向那些看不起革命小将和借他们某些缺点在工作上进行刁难的坏思想、坏作风进行斗争，以积极的态度来保护他们的革命热情，扶助他们，支持他们，在伟大毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，和他们一起共同来掌好权，用好权。
    青岛当前的形势很好。革命和生产都取得了很大的成绩，无产阶级革命派越来越壮大，无产阶级政权越来越巩固。今年的生产一月比一月好。我一定遵循毛主席的教导，和广大革命同志、革命群众一起，更好地贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，誓夺革命、生产双胜利！
    最后，让我高呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
