	This book is too important.

	Once, a Chinese comrade traveled from the capital of Congo (Brazzaville) to the northern Equatorial Province of Loubomo. On the way to Loubomo, there was a small town surrounded by woods, with only about twenty to thirty households. The town had a simple clinic run by a Congolese (Brazzaville) health worker. When the Chinese friend visited, he found several books of Chairman Mao's works on the health worker's desk, including one titled "On the Chongqing Negotiations." The health worker said, "This book is too important. Chairman Mao teaches us to face difficulties and dare to struggle against difficulties in our work." Indeed, he encountered many difficulties in his work. Whenever he faced difficulties, he would study this work by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's teaching that "We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties" was a great encouragement to him, helping him overcome numerous difficulties.

    这本书太重要了
    有一次中国同志从刚果（布）首都到北部赤道省卢寨堡去。在快到卢寨堡的路上有一个树林环绕的小镇，镇上只有二三十户人家。镇上有一个简陋的小诊疗所，由一位刚果（布）卫生员负责。中国朋友在参观时，在他的桌上发现了几本毛主席著作，其中一本是《关于重庆谈判》。这位卫生员说：“这本书太重要了。毛主席教导我们要面对困难，敢于向工作中的困难作斗争。”的确，他在工作中遇到不少困难。每当他遇到困难时，他就学习毛主席的这篇著作。毛主席的“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的”这个教导，对他是个巨大的鼓舞，使他克服了重重困难。
