Learn from Revolutionary Fighter Guo Jiaming, Martyr

Vice Platoon Leader of a Certain Unit of the PLA, Deng Liangwen

Recently, a name has been widely praised in our unit—Guo Jiaming. He was martyred on January 19 this year while rescuing state property.

I only knew Guo Jiaming for about twenty minutes in the fire, but in this short time, I saw a hero armed with Mao Zedong Thought. That afternoon, around 5:00 PM, a construction site suddenly caught fire. We rushed to the scene and saw flames shooting into the sky. The number one tarp on the anti-cold and warm shelter had burned up, and the number two tarp was ablaze. The flames were spreading, and it looked like they would soon reach the number three tarp. If the number three tarp burned, the fire would spread along the wind and the building, putting the entire site in danger of being burned down. Everyone bravely climbed onto the roof and jumped into the pit to rescue the situation. The 14-meter-long, 6-meter-wide tarp was spread across the shelter frame, which was about two meters apart. Below was a sea of fire and several rows of upright steel bars. The number two and number three tarps were connected at both ends with wire. Normally, walking on the shelter frame required great care, but now, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the firm belief of protecting state property and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were fiercely fighting the fire on the shelter frame. After a struggle, one end of the number three tarp quickly separated from the number two tarp. However, the other end was still connected. At this critical moment, the flames were just over a meter away from the number three tarp, and the wooden supports on both sides of the tarp were burning and cracking. The shelter frame could collapse at any moment, and it was impossible to walk on it. We couldn't go to the other side to untie the wire connecting the number two and number three tarps, and it was also difficult for the comrades on the other side to climb to the top of the shelter. What should we do? At this desperate moment, a young man suddenly jumped up in the firelight, shouting, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory!" He frantically tried to pull apart the tarp. Although the heat and smoke were intense, I clearly saw a tall figure. In the fire, on the verge of collapsing shelter frame, he was rolling up the tarp with all his might. Normally, it would take two or three people to roll up the tarp, but now he was doing it alone. Suddenly, the shelter frame tilted in the fire. The crowd shouting to put out the fire yelled, "Comrade, quickly come down, the frame is about to collapse, quickly come down!" He seemed not to hear, with sweat pouring down his face like rain, and his hoarse voice still shouting, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The number three tarp was finally rolled up, and the fire source was cut off. The threat of the fire to the entire site was eliminated. However, this heroic young man was martyred when the shelter frame collapsed.

The next day, I learned that this hero was Guo Jiaming, a comrade who loved the Party and Chairman Mao deeply, and who studied Chairman Mao's works diligently with profound class feelings. Guo Jiaming's comrade, for the people's interests, dared to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, and his fearless spirit is worth learning from forever.

Especially when I heard that during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Guo Jiaming was persecuted for bravely supporting the revolutionary masses in their struggle against the capitalist roaders in power within the Party. He was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" and "monster," and cruelly imprisoned for over four months. This capitalist reactionary line is so vicious! The crimes of this capitalist reactionary line must be thoroughly criticized and settled!

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently called for, "The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses." Our army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and most resolutely aid the genuine proletarian revolutionaries. With the spirit of Guo Jiaming, who dared to brave fire and water for the people's interests, and his brave and fearless spirit, we will wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly support the proletarian revolutionaries in seizing power. We will resolutely overthrow the capitalist roaders in power within the Party, thoroughly smash the capitalist reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    向无产阶级革命派战士郭嘉宏烈士学习
    解放军某部副排长　邓良文
    最近，在我们部队里，传颂着一个响亮的名字——郭嘉宏。他是今年一月十九日因抢救国家财产而光荣牺牲的。
    我认识郭嘉宏同志，虽然只有在火场上的二十多分钟，但是就在这短暂的时间里，我却看到了一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的形象。那天下午五点多钟，某建筑工地突然失火。我们闻讯跑到现场，只见火光冲天，工地防寒保暖棚架上的一号篷布烧毁了，二号篷布正在燃烧，熊熊的火焰正在蔓延，眼看就要烧到三号篷布了。如果三号篷布烧毁了，火势就会顺着风，沿着建筑物燃烧，整个工地就有全部被大火烧毁的危险。大家奋不顾身地爬上顶篷，跳下基坑，英勇抢救。十四米长、六米宽的篷布，横盖在左右间隔约两米的棚架上，下面是一片大火和几排直立的钢筋。二号篷布和三号篷布，是在两端用铅丝连结在一起的。平时，在棚架上行走都得小心翼翼，而今，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，抱着保护国家财产和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的坚强信念，在棚架上猛打猛扑。经过一阵搏斗，三号篷布的一端，很快和二号篷布分开了。但是，另一端仍然连接着。这时，烈火离三号篷布只有一米多远了，篷布两边的支撑木架被烧得“啪啪”直响。棚架随时都有倒塌的可能，架上已经不能行走了，我们这边的人不能到对面去解开连接二、三号篷布的铅丝，对面的同志要上到棚顶也很困难。怎么办？在这危急的时刻，火光里突然跳上来一个青年，他高喊着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一边拚命地去拉开篷布。虽然火烤烟熏，我却清清楚楚地看到一个高大的形象。他在烈火中，在快要倒塌的棚架上，使劲地向前猛卷着篷布。平时两三个人还不易卷动的篷布，此刻他一个人就卷动了。忽然棚架在烈火中倾斜了，四周救火的革命群众大声喊：“那个同志快下来，架子要塌了，快快下来！”他好象没有听见似的，脸上的汗珠象水一样往下淌，已经嘶哑了的嗓子还在喊着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”三号篷布终于被卷起来了，火源被切断了。烈火对整个工地的威胁解除了。但是，这个英雄的年轻人却因棚架倒塌而英勇牺牲了。
    第二天，我才知道，这个英雄叫郭嘉宏，是一个无限热爱党、无限热爱毛主席，满怀着深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作的好同志。郭嘉宏同志为了人民的利益，刀山敢上火海敢闯的大无畏精神，是值得我们永远学习的。
    特别是当我听说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，郭嘉宏同志因为勇敢地支持革命群众斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，受到坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的迫害，被打成了“现行反革命”、“牛鬼蛇神”，并被残酷地关押了四个多月的时候，真是怒火中烧。这条资产阶级反动路线是何等恶毒！这条资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，一定要彻底批判、彻底清算！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近号召：“人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众”。我军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，我们要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，最坚决地援助真正的无产阶级革命派，以郭嘉宏烈士为人民利益敢于赴汤蹈火的主动精神、勇敢精神和不怕牺牲精神，满腔热情地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持无产阶级革命派起来夺权，坚决打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
