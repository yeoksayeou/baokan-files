	Spring Arrives at the Mud-Dredging Boat
	Zou Hua

	The brigade leader, Ah Gen, returned from the commune's cadre meeting, feeling as if he had gained several hundred pounds of strength. He walked swiftly, his mind racing with excitement. Along the way, he patted his forehead and muttered to himself, "Today, I heard Chairman Mao's letter to us, the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres. My mind is so clear now. Chairman Mao truly cares for us cadres. I, Ah Gen, must follow Chairman Mao's words, stand tall, consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and make spring production a roaring success to repay Chairman Mao's kindness."

	That very night, Yangjia Production Brigade held a meeting of all members to discuss spring production work. At the meeting, Ah Gen took the lead, raising his voice and saying, "Chairman Mao says we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, are the main force for both revolution and production. We must follow every word of Chairman Mao's and take action immediately. The year's plan depends on spring. Now, spring production is urgent, and we can't delay any longer. Tomorrow morning, we'll go to the eastern river to dredge mud. What do you all think?"

	The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangjia Production Brigade, after hearing Chairman Mao's letter and seeing the brigade leader swiftly arrange spring production work, were overjoyed and discussed enthusiastically. Old peasant Fu Quan, while smoking, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's words in the letter hit the mark. This morning, I went to the fields and saw that the cotton fields lack base fertilizer, and I was worried. Ah Gen, please lead a few members to the river to dredge mud tomorrow."

	Before Old Fu could finish, the young member Yang Hongbing jumped up from the bench, patted his chest, and said, "Count me in. Ah Gen, let's do it. We'll meet at the big willow tree by the village entrance tomorrow." Saying this, he turned to prepare the mud-dredging tools.

	The next morning, a seven-level wind blew, and the temperature dropped to below zero. Ah Gen and Yang Hongbing met early at the village entrance. Without a word, they picked up the wooden mallets and nets and headed to the river. Although it was almost March, the river was still frozen. Today, Yangjia Production Brigade's boat was the first to go down the river.

	Ah Gen, this old peasant over fifty, jumped onto the boat and stood at the bow, facing the cold wind, vigorously wielding the wooden mallet, "bang bang" hitting the river ice. Yang Hongbing followed closely, jumping onto the boat and using a pole to fiercely hit the ice. Soon, other members rowed over, each hitting and chipping away, ice splinters flying, and the river was filled with a lively scene. Although their hands and toes were numb from the cold, their hearts were burning with passion.

	The ice was broken. The wind still howled, making the mud-dredging boat sway back and forth, sometimes moving forward, sometimes backward. The mud net was lowered into the river, but no mud was scooped up. Ah Gen warmed his hands and shouted to Yang Hongbing, "Last night, I read Chairman Mao's letter again and studied the quote, 'Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory.' Chairman Mao's instructions are our poor and lower-middle peasants' ideological weapons. Even if it's a seven-level wind today, we must stand firm. Even if the sky falls, we must hold it up."

	Yang Hongbing clenched his teeth and straightened his chest, saying, "We'll do as Chairman Mao says. In spring production, if we don't lead, who will? Ah Gen, we must see it through to the end!" Saying this, he turned sideways, loudly singing a song of Chairman Mao's quotes, and forcefully pushed the bamboo pole into the river, tying it with a thick rope. When the mud-dredging boat stabilized a bit, they immediately lowered the net to dredge mud.

	Black mud was scooped up net by net onto the boat, and boatload after boatload of mud was ferried ashore. The members laughed and chatted, competing with each other, full of enthusiasm. The sky gradually darkened, and the temperature dropped even lower. Ah Gen and the others dredged mud all day, their arms aching so much they could barely bend them, but they still worked energetically. "Dredge more, dredge even more, persist until victory, this is our poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres' reply to Chairman Mao!"

	It was completely dark. A fleet of mud-dredging boats glided over the water, heading towards the village. Loud songs of quotes and cheerful laughter could be heard from the boats.

    春到罱泥船
    邹华
    生产队长阿根从公社开过三级干部会议回来，浑身好象添了几百斤力气，走起路来象飞一样。一路上，他越想越激动，禁不住拍了拍自己的额头，自言自语地说：“今朝听到毛主席给我们贫下中农和农村干部的来信，脑筋真是一清爽，想想毛主席他老人家真是爱护我们干部，我阿根只有听毛主席的话，挺起腰杆，同贫下中农多商量，把春耕生产闹得热热火火，才对得住他老人家的心意。”
    当天夜里，杨家生产队马上召开了全体社员会议，讨论春耕生产工作。会上，阿根开了头炮，他提高嗓门，大声说：“毛主席说我们贫下中农是抓革命、促生产的主力军。毛主席的话，我们句句听，大家马上要拿出行动来。一年之计在于春，现在春耕生产已经火烧眉毛，再也不能耽搁了。明天一早就到东边河浜里罱河泥，大家看好不好？”
    杨家生产队的贫下中农听了毛主席的来信，又看到生产队长利利索索，立即布置春耕工作，都高兴得合不拢嘴，你一言我一语地热烈讨论起来。老贫农福全一边抽烟一边兴奋地说：“毛主席信上说的话，句句说到我的心坎上。昨日清早，我到田里转了转，看到棉花田里缺基肥，心里就急煞了。阿根，你明朝赶快领几个社员下河浜罱河泥去吧！”
    青年社员杨红兵不等福全老人说完，猛地从长凳上跳起来，拍拍胸膛说：“有我一个。阿根，我们说干就干，明朝村口大柳树下碰头。”说完，他转身就准备罱河泥工具去了。
    第二天早晨，刮起了七级大风，气温一下降到零下。阿根和杨红兵一早在村口会了面，二话没说，拿起打麦的木榔头和罱网就朝河浜走去。虽然快到三月了，河浜里还结着冰。今天，杨家生产队的船是头一个下河。
    阿根，这个年过五十的老贫农，一跳上船，就顶着寒风站立在船头上，精神抖擞地拿起木榔头，“嘭嘭”地敲打着河冰。杨红兵紧跟一步，一跃上船拿起篙头在后边狠狠地打冰。不一会，其他社员也撑着船赶来了，你打我敲，冰花四溅，河浜上充满了一片欢腾的景象。虽然他们的双手和脚趾冻得麻木了，可是他们的心却是火热火热的。
    河冰敲开了。大风依然呼喇喇地刮着，吹得罱泥船东摇西晃，一会儿朝前跑，一会儿向后退，罱泥网放进河里，一点泥也拉不上来。阿根暖了一下手，朝杨红兵大声地喊：“昨日夜里，我又读了几遍毛主席的来信，学习了‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’这条语录，毛主席的指示就是我们贫下中农的思想武器。不要说今朝刮七级风，就是天塌下来我们也要顶住。”杨红兵咬咬牙、挺挺胸说：“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。在春耕生产中，我们不领头干谁领头干？阿根，我们一定要干到底！”说着，他侧过身子，一边高声唱起毛主席语录歌，一边拿起竹篙头朝河里用力插下去，又用一根粗麻绳紧紧缚在竹篙上。等罱泥船稍稍平稳下来，他们马上就下网罱泥。
    黑乎乎的河泥一网一网拉上船，一船一船河泥穿梭似的送上岸，社员们有说有笑，你追我赶，干劲十足。天慢慢暗下来，气温越来越低，阿根他们拉了整整一天河泥，两只胳膊酸痛得有点弯不过来，但是他们还是起劲地干着。“多罱一点，再多罱一点，坚持下去，直到胜利，这就是我们贫下中农和农村干部给毛主席他老人家写的回信！”他们一边兴奋地想，一边一网一网地罱着。
    天完全黑了。一队罱泥船滑过水面，朝村头驶去，只听得船上传来一阵阵高亢的语录歌声和一串串愉快的说笑声。
