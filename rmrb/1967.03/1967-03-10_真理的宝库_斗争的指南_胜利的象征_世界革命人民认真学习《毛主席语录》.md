World revolutionary peoples earnestly study Chairman Mao's Quotations

The revolutionary peoples of the world have an unlimited love for the revolutionary treasure, "Chairman Mao's Quotations." They say, "Chairman Mao's Quotations" is a "spiritual atomic bomb," "a guide to the struggle for national liberation," and "the best book for solving contemporary problems."

A Malian student recently obtained a copy of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." He couldn't help but hold this treasure close, exclaiming, "This is a spiritual atomic bomb!" He went on to explain that three of his friends had longed for this book because they believed that "Chairman Mao's Quotations" is the best book for solving contemporary problems.

An American youth recently went to the Chinese Embassy in Cairo to request a copy of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." When he received the book, he excitedly said, "I am very happy to obtain the red book of the greatest leader of the world's peoples, Chairman Mao." He said, "China is a country with a very bright future because it has the wise leader Mao Zedong, who always believes in the people."

This American youth angrily denounced the U.S. government's policy of hostility towards China, its occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan, and its aggression in Vietnam. He said, "The U.S. government's policy of aggression only represents the interests of American monopolists and does not represent the will of the American people. One day, we American people will overthrow the U.S. government."

A pilot from East Africa once came to the Chinese Embassy in Cairo and said that on his plane, he saw many passengers reading "Chairman Mao's Quotations." He was very envious and longed to have a copy himself. So, he took the opportunity during a short stopover in Cairo to rush to the Chinese Embassy to request a copy of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." When his request was fulfilled, he hurried back to the airport, very happy.

A worker from Zanzibar who recently read "Chairman Mao's Quotations" told a Chinese friend, "Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has deeply educated me. The victory of the armed revolution in Zanzibar in January 1964 proves that this judgment is completely correct."

He said, "As long as the peoples of the world unite, they will definitely be able to defeat imperialism and revisionism. All reactionaries cannot escape their ultimate doom."

A Tanzanian friend who does mass work told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Every sentence in 'Chairman Mao's Quotations' is truth. No matter which page I read, I learn a lot. Mao Zedong Thought not only inherits but also develops Marxism-Leninism."

He went on to say, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'All correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses.' I follow Chairman Mao's teachings, improve my work methods, and make progress."

When talking about his experience in studying "Chairman Mao's Quotations," he said that Chairman Mao's judgment on the division of wars into just and unjust is completely correct. Distinguishing the nature of wars is very important. He said that a revolutionary must support the oppressed peoples in their struggle against imperialist aggression, a just war, and oppose imperialist unjust wars of aggression. Currently, we must support the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression for national salvation.

An Iranian revolutionary, after eagerly receiving a copy of "Chairman Mao's Quotations," excitedly said, "This precious red book is our guide in the struggle against American imperialism and for national liberation, a symbol of victory."

He went on to say, "The revisionists of the Khrushchev type—Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like—have long abandoned all the principles of world revolution. Now, all revolutionary peoples of the world place their hopes in Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has always firmly stood with the revolutionary peoples of the world and insisted on carrying the world revolution through to the end."

    真理的宝库　斗争的指南　胜利的象征
    世界革命人民认真学习《毛主席语录》
    新华社九日讯　世界革命人民无限热爱革命宝书《毛主席语录》。他们说：《毛主席语录》“是精神原子弹”，“是争取民族解放斗争的指南”，“是解决当代问题的最好的书”。
    一位马里学生最近得到一本《毛主席语录》，他情不自禁地捧着这本宝书，高呼：“这是精神原子弹”。他接着解释说，他有三位朋友渴望得到这本书，因为他们认为，《毛主席语录》是解决当代问题的最好的书。
    一个美国青年最近到中国驻开罗大使馆索取《毛主席语录》。当他得到这本宝书时兴奋地说：“我能够得到世界人民最伟大的领袖毛主席的红书，感到非常高兴。”他说：“中国是具有最光明前途的国家，因为它有着始终坚信人民的英明领袖毛泽东。”
    这位美国青年愤怒谴责美国政府实行敌视中国的政策、霸占中国领土台湾，谴责美国进行侵略越南的战争。他说：“美国政府的侵略政策只能代表美国垄断资本家的利益，不能代表美国人民的意志。我们美国人民总有一天要推翻美国政府。”
    来自东非的一位班机的机长，有一天来到中国驻开罗大使馆说，在他的飞机上，他看到许多旅客读《毛主席语录》，他非常羡慕，渴望自己也能有一本。所以他趁在开罗作短暂逗留的时机，赶忙到中国大使馆来要求得到一本《毛主席语录》。当他的要求得到了满足时，他非常高兴地赶回机场去了。
    最近读了《毛主席语录》的一位桑给巴尔工人对中国朋友说：“毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断使我受到深刻的教育。一九六四年桑给巴尔一月武装革命的胜利证明这个论断是完全正确的。”
    他说：“只要全世界人民联合起来，他们就一定能够打败帝国主义和修正主义。一切反动派都无法逃脱终将灭亡的命运。”
    一位做群众工作的坦桑尼亚朋友对新华社记者说：“《毛主席语录》里的话，句句都是真理。无论读到哪一页，我都学到了很多东西。毛泽东思想不仅继承了、而且发展了马克思列宁主义。”
    他又说：“毛主席教导我们：‘凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去’。我遵循毛主席的教导，改进了我的工作方法，取得了进步。”
    他在谈到学习《毛主席语录》的心得时说，毛主席关于战争分为正义的和非正义的论断是完全正确的。区别战争的性质是非常重要的。他说，一个革命者要支持被压迫人民抗击帝国主义侵略的正义战争，反对帝国主义的非正义的侵略战争。目前，我们要支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    一位伊朗革命者在喜得渴望已久的《毛主席语录》后激动地说：“这本珍贵的红书是我们反对美帝国主义、争取民族解放斗争的指南，是胜利的象征。”
    他接着说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者——勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流早已抛弃了世界革命的一切原则。现在，全世界革命人民都把希望寄托于毛主席。毛主席始终坚定地同世界革命人民站在一起，坚持把世界革命进行到底。
