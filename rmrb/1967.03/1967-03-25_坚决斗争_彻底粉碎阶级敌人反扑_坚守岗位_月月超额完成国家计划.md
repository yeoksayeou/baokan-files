The revolutionary workers and cadres of the Xinwen Mining Bureau, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are resolutely fighting and thoroughly smashing the counterattacks of class enemies. They are steadfastly at their posts and completing the national plan ahead of schedule every month.

With the assistance of the stationed troops, the revolutionary organizations have united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Most of the leading cadres have joined the production leadership teams at various levels. The coal output has increased by 11% compared to the same period last year.

The People's Daily reports: Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Xinwen Mining Bureau in Shandong Province, under the guidance of the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, have been full of vigor and fighting spirit. They have exposed a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and achieved initial victories in the struggle. However, the class enemies do not accept their defeat. They have colluded with the ghosts and snakes in society to launch a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionaries in January and February. They incited workers to go to Beijing and Shanghai to "file complaints," shouting that revolution and production are opposed, saying that the "eight-hour workday can be flexibly implemented," attempting to disrupt production and achieve their evil goal of sabotaging production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A handful of bad elements used the so-called "Shandong Provincial Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Alliance Xinwen Branch" to deceive some of the masses and attempted to seize power in some production departments of this mining area. However, the tens of thousands of revolutionary workers of the Xinwen Mining Bureau have fought back against the class enemies, smashing their plot to seize power. In the struggle, they have always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, strictly following the "Sixteen Points," and adhering to the eight-hour workday. In January, some people with ulterior motives went to Liangzhuang Mine to debate with the workers. Just as they were about to start work, they still wouldn't let go, trying to prevent the workers from going to work. The revolutionary workers saw through their tricks and, dressed in their work clothes, stood in line, holding up Chairman Mao's quotations, and marched into the production battlefield with a heroic demeanor. On January 7, the class enemies incited some uninformed masses to attack the revolutionary workers, from the evening until 4 a.m. the next morning. However, the revolutionary workers still went down to the mine on time the next morning.

The revolutionary workers and cadres of the Xinwen Mining Bureau have responded to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to seize the revolution and promote production. In the struggle to complete the coal production plan ahead of schedule, they have played a leading role.

After seizing power, they held "seize the revolution, promote production" three-level cadre meetings and engineer seminars, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the editorials of the "Red Flag" magazine, making the cadres who joined the production leadership teams stand up and lead boldly. Many of the mine managers and workshop supervisors and team leaders of this mining bureau are old miners, with high class consciousness and a strong sense of responsibility to complete the national plan. The deputy manager of Liangzhuang Mine, when besieged by class enemies, still insisted on holding production meetings, arranging and checking production. He said: "I am a Communist Party member and should be tempered in the storm; resolutely completing the national plan is Chairman Mao's order to us, the working class!" During the most intense struggle, many mine and workshop managers worked in the mines during the day and stayed in the workshops on duty at night, solving problems as they arose. Some cadres went up to the mine to seriously check their mistakes with the workers and went down to the mine to lead production boldly. The high sense of responsibility of the revolutionary cadres in the Xinwen Mining Area has ensured that the production tasks of the entire mining bureau are completed quickly and well.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in the Xinwen area, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, has carried on the tradition of "the army is a fighting force and a work force." They sent propaganda teams to go deep into the mining area to assist the revolutionary workers and cadres in seizing the revolution and promoting production, playing an important role. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army organized the workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, did a lot of political and ideological work, split and dissolved the conservative organizations manipulated by a handful of bad elements; in cooperation with the public security departments, they took dictatorial measures against the few counter-revolutionaries who attempted to sabotage production and the Cultural Revolution, and won over the deceived masses, making them return to the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. They went deep into the masses, propagating the policy of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the "three-in-one combination," helping the revolutionary workers to grasp the general direction of the struggle, helping various combat organizations to unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. They also, together with the revolutionary workers, did a lot of in-depth and detailed ideological work on the leading cadres at various levels of the mining area, helping the cadres to come forward consciously and seize the revolution and promote production together with the worker masses. Now, 70% of the leading cadres of the mining bureau have joined the production leadership teams at various levels, strongly promoting the production of the entire mining area.

The broad masses of militiamen in this mining bureau have firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, and have fought resolutely against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes. The 36 soldiers of the armed militia platoon of the Shajiang Mine Sand Pit Workshop, at the most intense time of the struggle when the enemy was most arrogant, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's highest directive "All reactionaries are paper tigers," strengthened their confidence in victory, and fought even more vigorously. At the same time, they steadfastly guarded their production posts, seriously carried out production, and the amount of sand extracted increased rapidly, with the output per shift reaching 780 cubic meters, creating a new high since the mine was established. After the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Revolutionary Workers and Cadres of All Factories and Mines in the Country" was sent to the Xinwen Mining Area, the broad revolutionary workers and cadres immediately organized to study it. They decided to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call with new and greater achievements. The Zhang Leqi class of the San Village Mine Backfill Section 3 completed the national plan ahead of schedule in January and February, and even more so in March, producing more coal every day. On March 19, when they heard this great call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, they immediately studied Chairman Mao's quotations in the class before work: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Then, they carried more than 100 jin of metal supports, climbed up the very steep working face, and with one breath, produced 100 tons of coal in one shift, exceeding the plan by 42.9%.

Under the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary workers and cadres of the Xinwen Mining Area are now fighting with a new attitude to seize greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and coal production.

    新汶矿务局革命职工在毛主席的革命路线指引下
    坚决斗争　彻底粉碎阶级敌人反扑
    坚守岗位　月月超额完成国家计划
    在驻军大力协助下，革命组织在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来；大多数领导干部参加了各级生产领导班子；原煤产量比去年同期增加百分之十一
    本报讯　山东新汶矿务局的革命职工和革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中坚决贯彻执行十六条，“抓革命，促生产”。今年第一季度，月月超额完成国家计划。到三月二十日为止，全矿务局的原煤产量，比去年同期增产百分之十一点二五，掘进进度超计划二千三百余米，原煤质量和劳动效率都有所提高，成本比计划降低。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，这个矿的革命职工，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，取得了斗争的初步胜利。但是阶级敌人并不甘心自己的失败，他们和社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结在一起，在今年一、二月份向革命派进行疯狂反扑。他们煽动工人到北京、上海去“告状”，叫嚣什么革命和生产对立，说什么“八小时工作制可以灵活执行”，妄图中断生产，达到破坏生产破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。一小撮坏人，利用所谓“山东省工人革命造反联合会新汶分会”，蒙蔽一些群众，曾经在这个矿区的个别生产部门，抢大印，搞假夺权。但是，新汶矿务局几万革命职工，向阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，及时地粉碎了敌人搞假夺权的阴谋活动。他们在斗争中始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，严格按照十六条办事，坚持八小时工作制。今年一月，一些别有用心的人到良庄矿和工人进行辩论，快上班的时候，他们还缠住不放，企图不让工人上班。革命工人识破了他们的阴谋诡计，大家换上工作服，站好队，高举毛主席语录牌，英姿飒爽地投入生产战场。一月七日，阶级敌人又挑动一些不明真相的群众，围攻革命工人，从晚上直到清晨四点钟，但是第二天一早，革命工人仍然按时下井劳动。
    新汶矿务局的革命职工和革命干部，响应毛主席和党中央的号召，紧抓革命，猛促生产，在超额完成煤炭生产计划的斗争中，发挥了骨干作用。
    他们夺权以后，先后召开“抓革命，促生产”的三级干部会议，矿长、工程师座谈会，组织大家学习毛主席著作和《红旗》杂志社论，使参加生产领导班子的干部，挺起腰杆大胆领导。这个矿务局的许多矿长和工区区长、队长多是老矿工出身，他们的阶级觉悟高，完成国家计划的责任感很强。良庄矿副矿长在遭到阶级敌人的围攻时，仍然坚持召开生产会议，布置和检查生产。他说：“我是一个共产党员，应当在大风大浪中经得起锻炼；坚决完成国家计划，这是毛主席给我们工人阶级的命令！”在斗争最紧张的时候，不少矿、区长白天下井指挥生产，晚上住在工区值班，发现问题及时解决。有的干部上井向工人认真检查错误，下井大胆领导生产。新汶矿区革命干部的这种高度的认真负责精神，保证了整个矿务局的生产任务完成得又快又好。
    驻新汶地区的人民解放军，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，发扬“解放军是战斗队又是工作队”的传统。他们派出了宣传队，深入矿区大力协助革命职工和革命干部抓革命、促生产，起了重要的作用。解放军同志组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，做了大量的政治思想工作，分化瓦解受一小撮坏分子操纵利用的保守派组织；配合公安部门，对极少数企图破坏生产，破坏文化大革命的反革命分子采取专政措施，同时争取受蒙蔽的群众，使他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们深入群众，宣传无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”方针，帮助革命职工掌握斗争的大方向，帮助各战斗组织在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来，联合起来。他们还和革命职工一起，对于矿区的各级领导干部做了大量深入细致的思想工作，帮助干部自觉地站出来，和工人群众一起抓革命、促生产。现在，矿务局已有百分之七十的领导干部参加各级生产领导班子，有力地推动了全矿区的生产。
    这个矿务局的广大民兵，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，和进矿的人民解放军紧密合作，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神进行了坚决的斗争。良庄矿砂井工区武装民兵排的三十六名战士，在斗争最激烈、敌人最嚣张的时候，反复学习“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的最高指示，增强了必胜的信心，更有力地投入战斗。同时，他们坚守生产岗位，认真搞好生产，采砂量直线上升，班产量达到七百八十立方米，创立了建矿以来的最高纪录。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》传到新汶矿区以后，广大革命职工、革命干部立即组织学习，他们决心以新的更大成绩，来响应毛主席、党中央的伟大号召。孙村矿回采三区张乐起班，一、二月份都超额完成了国家计划，三月份更是天天超产。三月十九日，当他们听到毛主席、党中央发出的这一伟大号召后，就在班前学习了毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”接着，他们便扛着一百多斤重的金属支柱，爬上很陡的掌子面，一鼓作气，一个班产煤一百吨，超过计划百分之四十二点九。
    在毛主席、党中央的伟大号召下，在人民解放军的大力支持下，新汶矿区的革命职工、革命干部正以新的姿态投入战斗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命和煤炭生产的更大胜利而英勇奋斗。
