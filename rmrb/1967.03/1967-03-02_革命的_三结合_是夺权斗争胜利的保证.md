The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is the guarantee for the victory of the seizure of power struggle. The proletarian revolutionary factions in Shandong Province have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize power jointly. They have gone through sharp and intense class struggles, and a serious struggle to smash the class enemy's fake seizure of power. They have broken through numerous obstacles, and seized back the party, government, economic, and cultural powers that had been usurped by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. They have established the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in Shandong Province! We extend our warmest congratulations to the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Shandong Province, and to the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Shandong!

Chairman Mao teaches us: When the representatives of various exploiting classes find themselves in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and facilitate their future development, they often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend. They either fabricate rumors out of nothing, or seize on a few superficial phenomena to attack the essence of things; they either praise a part of the people to attack another part, or use an opportunity to "break through some gaps," putting us in a difficult position. In short, they are always studying strategies to counter us, "observing the direction," seeking an opportunity to succeed. We revolutionary party members must understand their tactics, study their strategies, and defeat them. We must not be naive and simplistic in viewing the complex class struggle. The experiences and lessons of the seizure of power struggles in Shandong and other regions fully prove Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment.

The main experience of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shandong Province in the seizure of power struggle is to rely on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to smash the class enemy's fake seizure of power conspiracy.

At the critical moment of class struggle, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee staged a farce of fake seizure of power, digging their own graves. These reactionaries used various political and economic means to bribe certain leaders of some organizations, turning them into their agents and protectors. They engaged in secret deals, making "gentlemen's agreements" and "peaceful transfers of power" to achieve the goal of behind-the-scenes manipulation, protecting themselves, and continuing to hold onto power. At the same time, they used the deceived masses to exert pressure on the genuine proletarian revolutionary factions' seizure of power struggle, causing work units to come to a standstill, and attempting to sabotage the socialist economy. They recklessly attacked the public security organs and stormed the People's Liberation Army, attempting to undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their conspiracies must be thoroughly exposed and resolutely struck down!

How to smash the enemy's rampant counterattacks? The proletarian revolutionary factions in Shandong Province have unshakably implemented Chairman Mao's correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize power jointly! The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations in Shandong Province are the foundation of the seizure of power struggle. It is they who have exposed the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, and it is they who have seen through the class enemy's fake seizure of power conspiracy. At the decisive moment, their great role has been even more evident.

At the critical moment of the seizure of power struggle, revolutionary cadres in Shandong Province have stood up one after another, siding with the proletarian revolutionary factions and fighting shoulder to shoulder with them. Revolutionary cadres, especially those who have long adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have played a major role in the victory of the seizure of power struggle.

The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Shandong have firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary factions during the most acute and complex days of struggle. The People's Liberation Army, together with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary leftist masses, has firmly grasped the party's policies represented by Chairman Mao, taken decisive measures, and resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, they launched a powerful political offensive to win over the deceived masses. At the most crucial moment of the seizure of power struggle, the People's Liberation Army played a decisive role. Their contributions are outstanding. This once again proves that our great commander-in-chief Mao Zedong's personally created and led People's Liberation Army is the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the strongest backing for the proletarian revolutionary factions.

The experience of Shandong fully demonstrates: Only the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can timely expose the various tricks and conspiracies of the class enemy, achieve military-civilian cooperation, and smash their evil activities of fake seizure of power and counter-seizure of power.

In the great showdown between the two classes, every individual, every mass organization, and every cadre will be subjected to a severe test. The key here is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on the proletarian position, eliminate all selfish thoughts, and wholeheartedly serve the proletarian seizure of power. If anyone is arrogant, thinking they are the best, and full of selfish thoughts, they will inevitably deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"; they will inevitably not unite but go it alone, not unite but split, not practice the "three-in-one combination" but exclude all cadres and all other organizations, even turning the spearhead against the People's Liberation Army. They will inevitably make serious mistakes and be used by the enemies of the proletariat. In this way, even if they have made many achievements in the past, they will stand on the opposite side of the proletarian revolutionary factions at the crucial moment of the seizure of power struggle. This is something that needs special attention.

We must believe in the vast majority of the masses. Some mass organizations, at the crucial moment of the seizure of power struggle, were deceived by the enemy and became their tools. We must adopt a cautious attitude towards them and treat them differently. Those individual die-hard ringleaders must be resolutely suppressed. For the masses who do not know the truth, we must patiently do work to win them over and educate them, so that they can wake up and continue to participate in the revolution, instead of discriminating against them. In this way, we can strengthen the leftist forces, unite the broad masses, and greatly isolate the small clique of enemies of the proletariat. The proletarian revolutionary factions in Shandong Province have set a good example in this regard.

On the eve of the decisive battle of the Chinese People's Liberation War, Chairman Mao pointed out to the entire party: "Only when the party's policies and strategies are all on the right track will the Chinese revolution have the possibility of victory." Looking at the current favorable situation, Chairman Mao's great policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize power jointly and a series of correct policies are being rapidly grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionary factions' seizure of power struggle is advancing along the track pointed out by Chairman Mao, smashing all obstacles, surging forward like a tidal wave, and advancing to victory!

### 革命的“三结合”是夺权斗争胜利的保证

    革命的“三结合”是夺权斗争胜利的保证
    山东省无产阶级革命派，坚决执行毛主席的革命的“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针，经历了尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，经历了一场粉碎阶级敌人搞假夺权的严重斗争，冲破重重阻力，夺回了被省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃取的党、政、财、文大权，成立了山东省革命委员会。
    这是毛泽东思想在山东省的新的伟大胜利！我们向山东省广大革命群众和革命干部，向中国人民解放军驻山东地区部队，致以最热烈的祝贺！
    毛主席教导我们：各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。或者无中生有，当面造谣；或者抓住若干表面现象，攻击事情的本质；或者吹捧一部分人，攻击一部分人；或者借题发挥，“冲破一些缺口”，使我们处于困难地位。总之，他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，“窥测方向”，以求一逞。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。山东和其他地区夺权斗争的经验教训，充分地证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    山东省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的主要经验，就是依靠革命的“三结合”，粉碎了阶级敌人的假夺权阴谋。
    山东省委、省人委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在阶级斗争的紧急关头，演出了假夺权的丑剧，为自己挖掘了坟墓。这些反动分子，利用各种政治手段和经济手段，收买某些组织的个别头头，把这些人变成他们的代理人和保护人。他们进行秘密交易，搞什么“君子协定”，“和平让权”，以达到幕后操纵，保护自己，继续把持权力的目的。同时，他们利用那些受蒙蔽的群众，向真正的无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争施加压力，使工作机构陷于停顿，力图破坏社会主义经济。他们狂妄袭击公安部门，冲击中国人民解放军，力图破坏无产阶级专政。对于他们的这些阴谋，必须彻底揭穿，迎头痛击！
    怎样粉碎敌人的猖狂反扑？山东省的无产阶级革命派，坚定不移地执行毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针！山东省广大的革命群众和革命群众组织，是夺权斗争的基础。正是他们把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，正是他们识破了阶级敌人假夺权的阴谋。在决战的关头，更加显示了他们的伟大的作用。
    在夺权斗争的关键时刻，山东省革命的领导干部一批一批地挺身而出，站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们并肩战斗。革命干部，特别是长期坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，对于夺权斗争的胜利起了重大作用。
    中国人民解放军驻山东地区部队，在最尖锐复杂的斗争日子里，坚定地支持无产阶级革命派。人民解放军同革命干部、革命左派群众一起牢牢掌握以毛主席为伟大代表的党的方针政策，果断地采取措施，坚决镇压反革命，同时发动了强大的政治攻势，争取受蒙蔽的群众。解放军在夺权斗争最紧要的关头，起了决定性的作用。他们的贡献是十分杰出的。这再一次证明，我们伟大的统帅毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导的人民解放军，是无产阶级专政最强大的支柱，是无产阶级革命派最强大的靠山。
    山东的经验充分说明：只有革命的“三结合”，才能及时识破阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计，实现军民配合，粉碎他们假夺权、反夺权的罪恶活动。
    在两个阶级的大决战中，每个人，每个群众组织，每个干部，都要重新受到严峻的考验。在这里，关键在于高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚定地站稳无产阶级的立场，破除一切私心杂念，全心全意地为无产阶级夺权。谁要是唯我独尊，老子天下第一，满脑袋私心杂念，就必然会背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，背离革命的“三结合”的正确方针；就必然不搞联合搞单干，不搞团结搞分裂，不搞“三结合”而排斥一切领导干部，排斥一切其他的组织，甚至把矛头指向中国人民解放军，就必然会犯绝大的错误，以致被无产阶级的敌人所利用。这样下去，即使过去作出过多少成绩，也会在夺权斗争的关键时刻走到无产阶级革命派的对立面。这一点，是特别需要引起注意的。
    我们一定要相信群众的绝大多数。有些群众组织，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，受了敌人的蒙蔽，充当了敌人的工具，对他们要采取慎重的态度，区别对待。对那些个别死不悔改的首恶分子，必须坚决镇压。对于不明真相的群众，则必须对他们进行耐心的争取教育工作，使他们醒悟过来，继续参加革命，而不要歧视他们。这样，就能够壮大左派队伍，团结广大群众，极大地孤立一小撮无产阶级的敌人。山东省的无产阶级革命派，在这方面作出了很好的榜样。
    在中国人民解放战争的决战前夕，毛主席向全党指出：“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”喜看今日之大好形势，毛主席的革命的“三结合”联合夺权的伟大方针和一系列正确的政策，正在迅速被广大革命群众所掌握。无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，正在沿着毛主席指出的轨道，粉碎一切阻力，排山倒海，胜利前进！
