	Help
		Cen Dong

	The proletarian revolutionary faction should adopt two methods in dealing with leaders who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them: one is to observe, the other is to help.

	“Observe” means to examine them and give them the opportunity to correct their mistakes. Of course, just “observing” is not enough; we must also “help.”

	What does “help” mean? “Help” means assisting them in recognizing and correcting their mistakes, so that they can return to the path of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao as soon as possible.

	The basis for the change of things is indeed the internal cause, but the external cause is also an indispensable condition. A chicken must evolve from an egg, and a stone can never become a chicken. However, if there is no appropriate temperature and other conditions, an egg will remain an egg and can never become a chicken. For leaders who have made mistakes to return to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, they must first rely on their own conscious revolution. However, the “help” from revolutionary comrades is also an important condition that cannot be ignored for this transformation. Among our leaders, those who take the capitalist road and hold power are only a handful. Most leaders are good or relatively good. Although some of them have made various mistakes, they are revolutionary, not “stones.” As long as we provide them with “appropriate temperature and other conditions,” strictly and warmly help them, and patiently do political and ideological work, they can more quickly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

	Revolutionary comrades need to help each other. Chairman Mao teaches us: “All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.” As long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who persist in their errors and refuse to change, all leaders who have made mistakes are still our comrades in the revolutionary ranks, our class brothers. We have the responsibility to care for, love, and help them correct their mistakes.

	In helping these leaders, we must adopt an attitude of “treating the illness to save the person.” Some revolutionary masses, when exposing and criticizing mistakes, have passionately told those leaders: “We are not criticizing you into being a counter-revolutionary, but into being a revolutionary.” This is “treating the illness to save the person.”

	The proletarian revolutionary faction should enthusiastically and actively “help” leaders who have made mistakes. However, these leaders must also, with the spirit of “seizing the day,” correct their mistakes, discard their burdens, reform their thoughts, travel light, and join the proletarian revolutionary faction in making the revolution. If they persist in their mistakes, refuse to reform, refuse the help of the masses, and even turn around to attack the revolutionary masses, then the nature of their contradictions with the Party and the masses will change, and they will degenerate to the point where they cannot be “helped” and become beyond redemption.

    帮

    无产阶级革命派对待犯有错误、而又愿意改正的领导干部，应当采取两个办法：一是看，二是帮。
    “看”，就是考察他们，给他们改正错误的机会。当然，光“看”不行，还要“帮”。
    什么叫“帮”？“帮”，就是帮助他们认识错误和改正错误，促使他们早日回到毛泽东思想的轨道上来，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    事物变化的根据固然是内因，但外因也是必不可少的条件。鸡必须由鸡蛋来演变，石头永远变不成鸡。不过，如果没有适当的温度等条件，鸡蛋永远还是鸡蛋，决不可能变成鸡。犯错误的领导干部要回到毛主席的革命路线上来，首先要靠他们自觉革命。但是，革命同志的“帮”，也是实现这个转变不可忽视的重要条件。在我们的领导干部中，走资本主义道路的当权派只是一小撮，大多数领导干部是好的和比较好的。尽管其中有些人犯有这样那样的错误，但他们是要革命的，而不是什么“石头”。只要我们给以“适当的温度等条件”，严格而又热情地帮助他们，耐心地做政治思想工作，他们是可以更快地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线方面来的。
    革命同志之间需要互相帮助。毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，一切犯了错误的领导干部仍然是我们革命队伍中的同志，是我们的阶级兄弟。我们有责任关心、爱护他们，帮助他们改正错误。
    帮助这些领导干部，必须采取“治病救人”的态度。有些革命群众在揭发、批判错误的时候，曾经满腔热情地对那些领导干部说：“我们不是要把你‘批’成反革命，而是要把你‘批’成革命派。”这就是“治病救人”。
    无产阶级革命派对于犯过错误的领导干部应当热情地
    “帮”，积极地“帮”。但是，这些领导干部自己也必须用“只争朝夕”的精神，修正错误，丢掉包袱，改造思想，轻装前进，跟无产阶级革命派一块闹革命。如果他们坚持错误，拒绝改造，拒绝群众的帮助，甚至掉转头来打击革命群众，那么，他们与党和群众的矛盾性质就会起变化，就会堕落到无法“帮”的不可救药的地步。
