The primary task in supporting the revolutionary left is to provide political and ideological backing. The experience of the troops stationed at Dutou is fully in line with Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. It is a valuable experience that the entire military should seriously study and widely promote.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that mobilizes the masses to educate themselves and liberate their own minds. No one can or should take over this task. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the masses to educate themselves and liberate their own minds. There is much work to be done in supporting the revolutionary left, and the masses will make many demands of us. However, we must always remember that the most fundamental task is to support the left politically and ideologically, to help the revolutionary left seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, correctly grasp and implement the party's policies, and grow and strengthen under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on their own strength to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their own regions and units.

Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul. Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings, instructs us to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in all work, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to emphasize politics, to adhere to the Four Firsts, and to grasp and transform active thoughts. In supporting the left's struggle, we must never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to emphasize politics, and to place political and ideological work in the first position, making political and ideological work the foundation of all work in supporting the left's struggle.

"Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle." Mao Zedong Thought is the common ideological foundation for the unity and revolution of the people of the entire country, and it is the guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary mass organizations must be armed with Mao Zedong Thought to achieve victory in the cultural revolution.

Our support for the left's struggle is to help them actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, to help them learn and understand the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must help them use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to grasp active thoughts, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, transform their worldviews, enhance their revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and fundamentally improve the combat effectiveness of revolutionary mass organizations. When the broad masses are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and their proletarian political consciousness is raised, they will unite as one, unleash boundless creativity, and be able to overcome all difficulties. In the face of adversity, they will not be shaken or crushed; in times of victory, they will maintain a clear mind and strong fighting spirit. In the struggle between the two lines, they will always adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

"Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party." The series of policies and guidelines issued by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to guide the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution summarize the new experiences created by the broad masses in the current cultural revolution. Only by fully implementing these policies and guidelines can the revolutionary movement proceed correctly and victoriously.

Our support for the left's struggle is to help them correctly understand and implement the series of policies and guidelines formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, grasp the direction of the struggle, and improve the art of struggle. We must help the revolutionary left consciously act according to the party's policies and strategies, dare to struggle and be good at struggling, unite with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and achieve victory in both revolution and production.

The experience of many units supporting the left's struggle has proven that by doing a good job in political and ideological work and implementing Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies among the masses, everything will fall into place. This kind of political and ideological support is the most powerful, and the revolutionary masses welcome it the most. As the broad masses say, "Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, the PLA bringing Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support."

For the broad cadres and soldiers of our army, supporting the left politically and ideologically is a high requirement. It requires us to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. It requires us to first combine the actual struggle with the study of Chairman Mao's works and the party's policies, to deeply understand and correctly apply them. It requires us to firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' spirit of initiative, listen to the masses' opinions in our work, adhere to the mass line, and humbly be the masses' students. It requires us to follow the dialectical materialist work method, do thorough investigations, conduct class analysis, understand the situation, grasp active thoughts, and work in a targeted manner.

The great leader Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses has great strategic significance for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and also has far-reaching significance for strengthening the proletarianization of our army and enhancing its combat effectiveness.

The process of supporting the left's struggle is a process of spreading Mao Zedong Thought and the PLA's political and ideological work experience to the broad masses, and it is also a process of our own learning of Mao Zedong Thought and political and ideological work. In this grand practice of mass political and ideological work, we should humbly learn from the good thoughts, good styles, good experiences, and good methods of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and greatly improve our proletarian consciousness and the level of our political and ideological work.

### 首要的是从政治思想上支持左派

    首要的是从政治思想上支持左派
    解放军支持革命左派，首要的是从政治思想上支持。渡口驻军的这条经验，是完全符合毛泽东思想，完全符合以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的好经验，值得全军认真学习，普遍推广。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是放手发动群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的思想大革命。任何人都不应该也不可能包办代替。毛泽东思想，是群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的强大思想武器。我们支持革命左派，有很多工作要做，群众也会向我们提出很多要求。但是任何时候，我们都要牢牢记住，最根本的是从政治思想上支持左派，是要帮助革命左派认真学习和运用毛泽东思想，正确掌握和执行党的方针政策，使他们在毛泽东思想哺育下，成长壮大，依靠他们自己的力量，搞好本地区、本单位的无产阶级文化大革命。
    毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂。林彪同志根据毛主席历来的教导，指示我们，在一切工作中，都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想。我们在支援左派的斗争中，一定要念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘突出政治，坚持把政治思想工作摆在第一位，使政治思想工作成为支援左派斗争的全盘工作的基础。
      “掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”毛泽东思想是全国人民团结和革命的共同思想基础，是无产阶级文化大革命的指南。革命的群众组织，必须用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能取得文化大革命胜利。
    我们支援左派斗争，就是要帮助他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，帮助他们学习和领会以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，处处按照毛主席的指示办事。帮助他们以毛泽东思想为指针抓好活思想，破私立公，改造世界观，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，从根本上提高革命群众组织的战斗力。广大群众用毛泽东思想武装起来，提高了无产阶级的政治觉悟，就会齐心，就会迸发出无穷无尽的创造力，就能够战胜一切困难。在逆流面前，冲不垮，压不倒，在胜利时刻，保持清醒的头脑，旺盛的斗志。在两条路线的斗争中，始终坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
      “政策和策略是党的生命”。毛主席和党中央指导无产阶级文化大革命的一系列方针政策，概括了当前无产阶级文化大革命中广大群众创造的新经验。只有不折不扣地贯彻执行这些方针政策，才能使革命运动沿着正确的轨道胜利前进。
    我们支援左派斗争，就是要帮助他们正确理解和切实贯彻毛主席和党中央制定的一系列方针政策，掌握斗争方向，提高斗争艺术。帮助革命左派自觉地按照党的政策和策略办事，既敢于斗争，又善于斗争，团结广大革命群众和革命干部，夺取革命生产双胜利。
    很多部队支援左派斗争的经验都证明，把政治思想工作做好了，把毛泽东思想和党的方针政策贯彻到群众中去，就能一通百通。这种政治思想上的支持，力量最大，革命群众最欢迎。正象广大群众说的那样：“千支援，万支援，解放军送来毛泽东思想是最大的支援。”
    从政治思想上支持左派，对我军广大干部战士来说，是一个很高的要求。它要求我们无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。它要求我们自己首先结合斗争的实际，努力学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策，要能深刻地理解，正确地运用。它要求我们坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，在工作中善于倾听群众意见，坚持走群众路线，老老实实地当群众的小学生。它要求我们按照辩证唯物论的工作方法，做好深入细致的调查研究，进行阶级分析，摸清情况，抓好活思想，有的放矢地去进行工作。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，对于无产阶级文化大革命具有重大的战略意义，对于加强我军的无产阶级革命化，提高我军的战斗力，也有着深远的意义。
    支援左派斗争的过程，是向广大群众传播毛泽东思想，传播我军政治思想工作经验的过程，也是我们自己学习毛泽东思想，学习政治思想工作的过程。我们要在这场规模宏伟的群众性政治思想工作的实践中，虚心学习革命群众和革命干部的好思想、好作风、好经验、好方法，把我们的无产阶级觉悟和政治思想工作水平，大大地提高一步。
                                    （三月二十五日）
