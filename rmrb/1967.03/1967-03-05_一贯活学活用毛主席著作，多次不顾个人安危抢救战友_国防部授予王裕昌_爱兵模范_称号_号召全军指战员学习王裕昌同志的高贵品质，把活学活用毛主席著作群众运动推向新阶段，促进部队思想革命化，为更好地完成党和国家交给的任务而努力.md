The Ministry of National Defense has issued an order conferring the title of "Model Soldier-Loving Comrade" on Wang Yuchang, a management staff member of a certain air force unit in the frontline of Fujian Province.

The order states that since Wang Yuchang joined the army, he has consistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, prioritized politics, and selflessly worked for the Party, demonstrating the spirit of "revolution first, work first, others first." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, he has deeply cared for the soldiers' hardships, especially focusing on arming the soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought and helping them grow politically. Most notably, he has risked his life five times to rescue comrades in danger.

The order introduces Wang Yuchang's heroic deed of sacrificing himself to rescue comrade Wu Xubin on May 30, 1965, with the spirit of "selflessness and dedication to others." On that day, during a live grenade training, barber Chen Kaitai accidentally dropped a grenade behind him. The grenade, about to explode, was rolling towards the shelter where Wu Xubin was recording. In this critical moment, Wang Yuchang stepped forward, immediately diving towards the rolling grenade, using his body to shield Wu Xubin and grabbing the grenade with his hand. Although Wu Xubin escaped unharmed, Wang Yuchang suffered dozens of injuries all over his body, resulting in severe disability.

The order states that Wang Yuchang has repeatedly risked his life to rescue revolutionary comrades, demonstrating his firm adherence to and unwavering loyalty to the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao. This is the result of his long-term study and application of Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. He is a model of soldier-loving comrades nurtured under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought in our army's grassroots cadres. Therefore, he is conferred the title of "Model Soldier-Loving Comrade."

The order concludes by hoping that Wang Yuchang will maintain and further his honor. It calls on all soldiers and officers in the army to learn from Wang Yuchang's noble qualities of caring for and loving comrades, and selflessly saving others. It urges them to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, carry forward the fine tradition of the army's respect for leaders and love for soldiers, further strengthen the bond between officers and soldiers, enhance the unity of the troops, and push the army's movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. This will promote the ideological revolutionization of the troops and strive to better accomplish the tasks assigned by the Party and the state!

    新华社四日讯　国防部发布命令，授予人民解放军福建前线空军某部管理员王裕昌以“爱兵模范”的光荣称号。
    命令说，王裕昌同志入伍以来，一贯活学活用毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，突出政治，忘我地为党工作，表现了革命第一，工作第一，他人第一。他遵照毛主席的教导，怀着深厚的阶级感情，关怀战士的疾苦，特别是他把用毛泽东思想武装战士头脑，从政治思想上帮助战士成长，当作自己义不容辞的责任。更突出的是，他曾经五次在关键时刻不顾个人安危，抢救遇险的战友。
    命令介绍了王裕昌同志以“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义精神，在一九六五年五月三十日舍身抢救战友吴绪斌的光辉事迹：这一天，部队进行手榴弹实弹训练。理发员陈开泰同志不慎将手榴弹掉到身后，将要爆炸的手榴弹眼看就要滚入正在作记录的吴绪斌同志所在的掩体。在这紧急时刻，王裕昌同志挺身而出，立即扑向正在滚动的手榴弹，边用身体掩护吴绪斌同志，边用手抓住手榴弹。由于手榴弹没有来得及投出就爆炸了，吴绪斌同志虽然安然脱险，但王裕昌同志却全身负伤数十处，造成严重残废。
    命令说，王裕昌同志多次不顾生命危险，抢救革命战友，表现了他坚决贯彻和无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的教导，是他长期活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的结果，是毛泽东思想光辉抚育下成长的我军基层干部中爱兵的模范。为此，特授予王裕昌同志以“爱兵模范”称号。
    命令最后说，希望王裕昌同志保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，并号召全军指战员学习王裕昌同志关心、爱护同志，舍己救人的高贵品质，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬我军尊干爱兵的优良传统，进一步密切官兵关系，加强部队团结，把我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段，促进部队思想革命化，为更好地完成党和国家交给的任务而努力！
