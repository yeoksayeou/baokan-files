The People's Bookstore in Congo (Brazzaville) sold copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" for the first time on the 9th in Brazzaville. Young people and members of the Congolese People's Defense Corps rushed to the bookstore to purchase it. Over 400 copies of the Little Red Book were sold out in a very short time.

When reporters encountered customers at the bookstore, they held the red books and said, "Thank you to the people of China, thank you to the great Chairman Mao for bringing us the red book." They also shouted, "Long live the people of China! Long live Chairman Mao!"

An employee at the People's Bookstore enthusiastically told the reporter, "Our bookstore has never had so many customers before. We hadn't even announced that the red book had arrived in the capital, but customers already knew and came to buy it."

A member of the People's Defense Corps bought three copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." He told the reporter, "One is for me, and the other two are for my good friends. We will study together and apply Mao Zedong Thought in our work."

    《毛主席语录》在刚果（布）受到热烈欢迎
    新华社布拉柴维尔电　刚果（布）人民书店九日在布拉柴维尔第一次出售全世界革命人民的宝书《毛主席语录》。刚果（布）青年和刚果民防队队员都涌往书店购买。四百多本红书在很短的时间里就销售一空。
    当记者在书店门口遇到顾客时，他们手持红书说：“谢谢人民中国，谢谢伟大的毛主席给我们带来了红书。”并且高呼：“人民中国万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    一位在人民书店工作的营业员热情地对记者说：“我们书店从来没有象今天这么多的顾客。先前我们并没有告诉过大家首都已到红书的消息，但是顾客却知道了，跑到书店来买。”
    一位民防队队员买了三本《毛主席语录》。他对记者说，一本我自己用，其他两本给我的好朋友。我们将一道学习，并在我们的工作中运用毛泽东思想。
