Recently, two Indian sailors working on a foreign ship took advantage of the ship's stop in Guangzhou's Huangpu Port to unload cargo. They sought out a port interpreter and, with hearts full of excitement, pulled out a piece of cloth from their pockets, stained with blood, and handed it to the Chinese interpreter. This piece of cloth, about the size of a palm, had a few lines of English written in blood, which read: "We yearn for a copy of the most precious book in the world—Mao Zedong's works! Long live the great Chairman Mao Zedong!"

Torture Cannot Break the Will of Revolutionaries

The two Indian sailors pointed to the bloodstained letter and said: The blood on this letter is that of Indian revolutionaries. They are currently imprisoned by American imperialists and their lackeys, the Indian reactionaries, in a prison somewhere in India. Their situation is extremely dangerous and harsh. However, Mao Zedong Thought has given them great hope and immense strength. Every time the Indian reactionaries torture them with cruel methods, beating them until they are covered in wounds, they recall the truths revealed by Chairman Mao to the revolutionary people of the world: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionary seems powerful, but in reality, he has no power at all. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese idiom describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are exactly such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people."

Chairman Mao's Teachings Illuminate the Path of Revolution

The two Indian sailors said: Chairman Mao's words have increased the determination and courage of Indian revolutionaries in prison to fight for India's national independence and the liberation of the working people a thousandfold. Their situation prevents them from personally expressing their love and respect for the greatest leader of the world's revolutionary people, Mao Zedong. At the same time, they urgently need more guidance from Chairman Mao to illuminate the path of revolution. Therefore, they tore a piece of white cloth from their own clothing, dipped it in their own blood, and wrote this short letter. After much difficulty, it was brought to us to be handed over to the most sincere comrades and brothers of the Indian revolutionary people—the Chinese people led by Mao Zedong.

The two Indian friends also said: The Indian people have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and believe in Mao Zedong Thought. This makes the lackeys of American imperialism, the Indian reactionaries, who are like mantises on the railway tracks, tremble with fear. The Indian reactionary government lists Chairman Mao's works as "banned books." If anyone reads them, they will be sentenced to prison. However, truth cannot be suppressed, and crows cannot cover the sun with their wings!

China's Today is India's Tomorrow

The port workers, deeply moved by the sincere and passionate words of the two Indian friends and the bloodstained letter full of victory and revolutionary spirit from Indian revolutionaries, warmly received the two Indian friends. They immediately found English versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for them and asked them to convey the sincere greetings and high respect of the Chinese people to the struggling Indian people and their imprisoned comrades. The port workers also took off their own Mao badges and "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" badges and pinned them on the chests of the two Indians. At this moment, the two Indian friends jumped up joyfully and repeatedly raised their hands, shouting, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" They embraced their Chinese friends warmly.

As the two Indian sailors bid farewell, they sighed with reluctance, saying they had been sold into hard labor as children and worked as sailors. One of them had come to Chinese docks in his youth and had personally seen the old China, which was as miserable as India. After liberation, he had personally seen the revolutionary new China led by Chairman Mao. They said with confidence: China's revolutionary present is India's future. We Indian people love New China and look up to Chairman Mao. Great Mao Zedong Thought will definitely become the guiding ideology of the Indian people.

### 毛泽东思想给革命者无穷的力量——记一封从印度监狱传来的革命者的血书

    毛泽东思想给革命者无穷的力量 
    ——记一封从印度监狱传来的革命者的血书
    不久前，有两位在外国轮船上工作的印度籍海员，趁这艘轮船在广州黄埔港靠岸卸货的机会，找到港口译员，怀着激动的心情，从怀里掏出一件用血写的书信，递到我国译员的手上。这封用血写在一块手掌大的白布上的信，只有短短的几行英文字，内容是：“我们渴望得到一部世界上最宝贵的——毛泽东的著作！伟大的毛泽东主席万岁！”
    酷刑摧残不了革命者的意志
    这两位印度海员指着这封血迹斑斓的信说：这上面的血是印度革命者的血，他们现在被美帝国主义者及其走狗印度反动派监禁在印度某地的监狱里，他们处境极其险恶而艰苦。但是，毛泽东思想给了他们伟大的希望和无比的力量。每当印度反动派用酷刑折磨他们，把他们打得遍体鳞伤的时候，他们就凭记忆来朗诵毛主席揭示给全世界革命人民的真理：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    毛主席的教导照亮革命的航向
    这两位印度海员说：毛主席的这些话，千百倍地增强了在监狱中的印度革命者为印度的民族独立和劳动人民的解放而斗争的决心和勇气。他们的处境使他们无法亲自表达对世界革命人民最伟大的领袖毛泽东的热爱和敬意，同时他们又迫切地要求得到毛主席更多的教益，来照亮革命的航向，所以才从自己的衣襟上撕下一块白布来，蘸着自己的鲜血，写了这样一封短短的信，并且几经周折，才由我们带来转交给印度革命人民最真挚的同志和兄弟——毛泽东领导下的中国人民。
    这两位印度朋友还说：印度人民是无限热爱毛主席和信仰毛泽东思想的。这使得美帝国主义的走狗印度反动派——这只爬在火车轨上的螳螂，害怕得要死。印度反动政府把毛主席著作列为“禁书”，如果谁要读，就会被判刑坐牢。但是，真理是封锁不住的，乌鸦张开翅膀，怎能遮住太阳的光辉！
    中国的今天就是印度的明天
    港口的工作人员听了这两位印度朋友发自内心的热情而激动的谈话，面对着印度革命者用鲜血写成的充满胜利信心和革命豪情的书信，深深受到感动，他们热情地接待了这两位印度朋友，并当即替他们找到了英文版的《毛主席语录》和《毛泽东选集》，并请他们向斗争中的印度人民和狱中的难友们转致中国人民真诚的问候和崇高的敬意。我港口工作人员还当场摘下自己佩戴的毛主席像章和“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的毛主席语录章，分别戴在他们两人的胸前。这时，这两位印度朋友高兴地跳起来，并连连举手高呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”他们同中国朋友热烈地拥抱在一起。
    两位印度海员在最后告别时，依依不舍地感慨地说，他们都是从小被卖身做苦工当船员的，其中一人在年轻时就跑中国码头，亲眼看到过曾和印度一样的苦难的旧中国，解放后又亲眼看到了毛主席领导下的革命的新中国。他们满怀信心地说：中国的革命的现在，就是印度的未来。我们印度人民热爱新中国，心向毛主席，伟大的毛泽东思想一定会成为印度人民的思想。
