	Warmly Congratulate Revolutionary Fighter Wang Yuchang, Armed with Mao Zedong Thought
	Fujian Frontline Troops Solemnly Hold Naming Ceremony

	The broad ranks of officers and soldiers express their determination to be like Wang Yuchang, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and to create new achievements in defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Wang Yuchang comrade vows to be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, maintain and carry forward the honor, and become a genuine good fighter of Chairman Mao.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the naming ceremony for the title "Model of Love for Soldiers" conferred by the Ministry of National Defense on Wang Yuchang, a management staff member of a certain unit of the Fujian Frontline Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was held on March 2 in Fuzhou. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers firmly expressed their determination to learn from comrade Wang Yuchang, to be loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life, and to create new achievements in defending the motherland and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Han Xianchu, responsible comrades of the Fujian Frontline Troops Liu Peishan, representatives of the Air Force leadership Li Ruoping, and revolutionary cadres of Fujian Province Wei Jinshui attended the meeting.

	The advanced collectives, hero models, and representatives of the army, navy, and air force who have been on duty day and night on the coastal defense front and recently, together with the revolutionary masses, have fought against the new counterattack launched by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fuzhou Municipal Committee, as well as the active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the entire army such as Feng Fusheng, brought the enthusiasm of the broad ranks of officers and soldiers to learn from Wang Yuchang and came from afar to participate in the meeting.

	The meeting began with the solemn song "The East is Red." The representatives present read Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "We are all from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... Our cadres must care for every soldier, and everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other."

	Han Xianchu, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense, read the order conferring the title "Model of Love for Soldiers" on Wang Yuchang and presented the certificate to Wang Yuchang on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense. When Wang Yuchang walked to the stage to receive the certificate, everyone stood up, and the applause was long and sustained. People expressed their warm congratulations to this revolutionary fighter armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	Liu Peishan, a responsible comrade of the Fujian Frontline Troops, spoke at the meeting. He said, Wang Yuchang comrade firmly acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, caring for soldiers more than himself, and has bravely rescued soldiers five times. In this struggle to smash the counter-revolutionary tide launched by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fuzhou Municipal Committee, he has a firm stand, clearly distinguishes between enemies and ourselves, and firmly stands on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, uniting with and fighting alongside the revolutionary leftists, and achieving victory together. This fully demonstrates his clear class stand, fully embodies the lofty qualities and firm class standpoint of a communist, and he is indeed a good fighter of Chairman Mao and a model of love for soldiers in our army.

	Liu Peishan said, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage, and the situation is very good. However, the class enemies will never give up their doom. Under such circumstances, carrying out the activity of learning from comrade Wang Yuchang has important significance. We must, through this learning activity, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, bring the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, further arm the minds of all officers and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the glorious traditions of our army, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all personnel, further strengthen unity and organizational discipline, enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops, and better accomplish the glorious tasks of seizing the revolution, promoting preparedness, promoting work, and promoting production given to us by the supreme commander Chairman Mao.

	Li Ruoping, a representative of the Air Force leadership, read the congratulatory message from the Air Force leadership. The message said, the heroic deeds of comrade Wang Yuchang originate from the great, invincible, brilliant, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought. Learning from comrade Wang Yuchang, the most fundamental thing is to strive to study Chairman Mao's works like him, to work hard on the "use" of them, to carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of the soul, to change the worldview, and to forever be a good fighter of Chairman Mao.

	In his speech, revolutionary cadre of Fujian Province Wei Jinshui highly praised the lofty thoughts and heroic deeds of Wang Yuchang and called on all the people of the province to learn from Wang Yuchang. He said, we have received great education, enlightenment, and encouragement from the deeds of comrade Wang Yuchang. We must take comrade Wang Yuchang as an example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, seize the revolution, promote production, launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production, fire the first shot of spring plowing, and ensure the double victory of revolution and production.

	After the representatives of the advanced collectives and hero models of the army, navy, and air force spoke, Wang Yuchang spoke with deep emotion. He sincerely wished our most red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life and wished the close comrade-in-arms of the great leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, good health. He said, I can do a little for the Party and the people, which is entirely the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. It is Chairman Mao who saved me from the bitter sea of the old society, gave me a new life, and made me grow from a bitter child of the old society into a revolutionary fighter. I cannot express my gratitude to Chairman Mao in a thousand words, and I cannot express my love for Mao Zedong Thought in three days and six nights; he firmly vowed to be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, maintain and carry forward the honor, read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, and firmly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be a genuine good fighter of Chairman Mao!

	The meeting ended in a triumphant atmosphere with slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    日夜坚守在海防前线并在最近同无产阶级革命派一起，在粉碎福建省委和福州市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所掀起的新反扑的斗争中，荣立新功的陆、海、空军部队的先进集体、英雄模范代表，以及全军学习毛主席著作积极分子丰福生等，带着广大指战员向王裕昌学习的热情，从远道赶来参加了大会。
    大会在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始。到会代表一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”

    福建前线部队负责人刘培善在会上讲话。他说，王裕昌同志坚决按毛主席指示办事，关心战士比关心自己为重，曾五次临危不惧，抢救战士。在这次粉碎福建省和福州市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掀起的反革命逆流中，他立场坚定，敌我分明，坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，同革命左派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。这充分表现了他无产阶级的爱憎分明，充分体现了一个共产主义者的崇高品质和坚强的阶级观点。他不愧是毛主席的好战士，我军的爱兵模范。

    空军领导机关代表李若平宣读了空军领导机关的贺信。贺信说，王裕昌同志的英雄行为，来源于伟大的、战无不胜的、光芒万丈的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想。学习王裕昌同志，最根本的就是要象他那样，努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在灵魂深处大闹革命，改造世界观，永远做毛主席的好战士。
    福建省革命领导干部魏金水在讲话中高度赞扬了王裕昌崇高的思想品质和英雄行为之后，号召全省人民向王裕昌学习，他说，我们从王裕昌同志的事迹中受到极大教育、启发和鼓舞。我们一定要以王裕昌为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，大抓革命，狠促生产，掀起工农业生产新高潮，打响春耕生产第一炮，保证革命、生产双胜利。
    在陆、海、空军部队的先进集体、英雄模范人物代表发言以后，王裕昌怀着激动的心情讲了话。他衷心敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席身体健康。他说，我能够为党为人民做一点事情，完全是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。是毛主席他老人家把我从旧社会的苦海里救了出来，使我得到新生，由一个旧社会的苦孩子，成长为一个革命战士。千言万语说不尽对毛主席的感激，三天六夜说不完对毛泽东思想的热爱；他坚决表示，一定要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，做一个名副其实的毛主席的好战士！
    大会在“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等口号声和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
