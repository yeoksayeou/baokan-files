The revolutionary cadres of Shandong Medical College, during the process of seizing power, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, and carried out thorough and detailed work on the ideological transformation of cadres. As a result, the majority of cadres who had made mistakes in their political line have made self-criticisms, corrected their errors, and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many cadres have also joined the revolutionary mass organizations.

Using the method of class analysis to identify cadres

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, after conducting a thorough investigation, we analyzed the cadres who had made mistakes in their political line. We believe that the reason they executed the bourgeois reactionary line was mainly because they were deceived. The contradictions between them and the Party and the masses are still internal contradictions among the people. To correctly resolve this contradiction, we must implement Chairman Mao's consistent teachings of "punishing the past to educate the future, curing the sickness to save the patient," and "achieving the dual goals of clarifying thought and uniting comrades."

In the process of investigating and analyzing the cadres who made mistakes in their political line, we found that some cadres have a longer history of participating in the revolution. Some, in the past years of arduous struggle, have made contributions to the Party and the people. They have rich political struggle experience and strong organizational abilities. As long as they can correct their mistakes and return to the correct line, they can continue to make new contributions to the Party and the people. We sincerely hope that these comrades can quickly correct their mistakes and develop into first-class cadres, and we do not want to see them persist in their mistakes, leading to a confrontation with the Party and the masses. Under this guiding thought, we formed a special team to do ideological work among the cadres, dividing into three groups to work with general cadres, mid-level cadres, and leading cadres respectively.

After starting the work among the cadres, there was a phenomenon within the revolutionary rebel faction of simply extracting materials from the cadres to expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and to expose for the sake of exposing. This approach is not conducive to promoting the ideological transformation of cadres. Chairman Mao said: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses, which has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people nationwide." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul. Just extracting materials from cadres cannot help them thoroughly understand the causes of their mistakes and the methods to correct them, nor can it unite them in the revolution. Materials are indeed needed, but they are not the only thing. We must first touch the souls of the cadres and raise their ideological level. Before the ideological problems of the cadres are solved, they will only produce materials that are not closely related to themselves. On the contrary, after the cadres change their stance, the problems they expose will be more numerous and profound than we had anticipated.

Educating cadres to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line

To make cadres who have made mistakes stand up, we must help them completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao said: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." Cadres can only improve their consciousness and truly consciously stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line by going among the masses and fighting together with them. However, at that time, some cadres still had various concerns and did not dare to go among the revolutionary masses. What should we do? We proactively invited them to come among the masses, to eat, live, and revolutionize together with the students.

After the cadres came among the masses, we patiently helped them politically, strictly demanded of them ideologically, and warmly cared for them in their lives. We also, based on the characteristics of each individual, used different methods to help them.

Mainly, based on the ideological problems they had, we studied with them "The Three Articles" (Quotations from Chairman Mao), "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and other brilliant works, as well as relevant quotations on the mass line. At the same time, we spoke extensively about the revolutionary situation and the Party's policies, urging them to consciously recognize their erroneous attitudes towards the mass movement, criticize their selfish thoughts, and make them feel that in the past, they indeed protected the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and were ungrateful to Chairman Mao and the Party's cultivation and education. They were then encouraged to expose the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and to resolve to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

For cadres who had made serious mistakes, we also handled them according to Chairman Mao's principle of "punishing the past to educate the future, curing the sickness to save the patient." There was a cadre who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, had done many bad things with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. After being exposed by the masses, he felt that there was no hope for him and his mood was very depressed. According to Chairman Mao's teachings on how to identify cadres, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of him. He came from a poor background, had been a Party member for more than twenty years, and had always worked diligently. Although he had taken the wrong side during the Cultural Revolution and executed the bourgeois reactionary line, as long as we did our work thoroughly, he would definitely be able to change. Therefore, we recalled his family history with him, recalled his history of following Chairman Mao in the revolution, encouraged his courage to correct his mistakes, and proactively did work with his family, through his family writing a letter to him, advising him to "find the root cause from the depths of your thoughts, don't be afraid of pain." The students also, based on his active thoughts, studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with him. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any mistakes that we cannot abandon?" Through such patient and detailed work, this comrade finally deeply criticized his own mistakes, pulled his feet out of the mire of the bourgeois reactionary line, made a comeback, thoroughly exposed the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and gained the understanding and trust of the masses.

After more than two months of work, the ideological situation of the cadres underwent a fundamental change. In the past, cadres were afraid to come among the masses, but now cadres all proactively request to eat, live, and revolutionize together with the masses. "The Three Together" improved the relationship between cadres and the masses, shortened the distance between cadres and the masses, and made the cadres burn away their mistakes in the furnace of the mass movement, change their stance, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Encouraging cadres who truly stand on the side of the revolutionary masses to make a comeback

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not only unite with those who agree with us, but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and even be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes." When cadres have the courage and determination to correct their mistakes, they will demand to thoroughly expose the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in front of the masses and demand to check their own mistakes. After sufficient preparation, we held a meeting to bombard the college party committee. This was both a meeting to deeply expose and criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and a meeting for cadres who had made mistakes but wanted to revolutionize to make a comeback. A cadre who participated in this meeting said deeply moved: "In the past fifty days, two meetings were held at both ends, and I didn't sleep for two nights. The first meeting criticized the bourgeois reactionary line that I executed, and when I thought of the mistakes I had made, the ideological struggle was intense, and I couldn't sleep. In the fifty days of 'eating, living, and revolutionizing together,' due to the patient help of comrades, I returned to Chairman Mao's side. This time, participating in the meeting to bombard the college party committee, I made a comeback, showing my determination to continue the revolution. Comrades welcomed me back with drums and gongs, and I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. I am deeply grateful from the bottom of my heart to Chairman Mao's care and the help of revolutionary comrades."

To hasten the shortening of the time for cadres who are still wavering, we asked cadres who had risen early to revolutionize to do work for them, using their personal experiences to speak from the heart, with advanced helping the backward, and the backward catching up with the advanced. This made more and more cadres quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and stand on the side of the revolutionary masses.

In the process of solving the cadre problem, we deeply felt the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, which, while transforming the objective world, also transformed our subjective world. We also concretely understood the brilliant truth that "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party."

    帮助犯错误的干部站出来
    山东医学院　东方红
    山东医学院无产阶级革命派在夺权的过程中，坚决执行了毛主席的干部政策，深入细致地做干部的思想工作，使全院犯过路线错误的干部，大部分作了检查，改正了错误，回到毛主席革命路线上来。很多干部还参加了革命派组织。
    用阶级分析的方法去识别干部
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”遵照毛主席的教导，经过摸底之后，我们对全院犯过路线错误的干部进行了具体的分析。我们认为，他们所以执行了资产阶级反动路线，主要是受了蒙蔽，他们同党同群众的矛盾还是人民内部矛盾。要正确解决这个矛盾，就必须执行毛主席一贯教导的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，“达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。”
    在对犯路线错误的干部摸底分析中，我们了解到有些干部参加革命的历史比较长，有的在过去艰苦斗争的岁月里，为党和人民立过功，他们有着较丰富的政治斗争经验，有着较强的组织能力。只要他们能改正错误，回到正确路线上来，就能继续为党为人民作出新贡献。我们热切地希望这些同志能迅速改正错误，发展成为一类干部，不愿意看着他们坚持错误，以至发展到同党和群众对抗的地步。就在这个思想指导下，我们组成了专门做干部思想工作的班子，分为三个组，分别做一般干部、中层干部和领导干部的工作。
    我们着手做干部工作后，在革命造反派内部曾经出现过单纯从干部那里去挖党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的材料，为揭盖子而揭盖子的现象。这种做法，不利于促进干部思想革命化。毛主席说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，光向干部要材料，既不能帮助他们在思想上彻底了解犯错误的原因和改正错误的办法，也不能团结他们一起革命。材料当然是需要的，但并不是唯一的，必须首先触及干部的灵魂，提高他们的思想。干部思想问题没解决之前，只会拿出些和自己牵连不大的材料。相反，干部立场转变之后，所揭发出来的问题，比我们预料的又多又深刻。
    教育干部同资产阶级反动路线划清界限
    要使犯错误的干部能够站出来，必须帮助他们同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。毛主席说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”干部只有到群众中去，同群众一起战斗，才能不断提高觉悟，认识文化大革命的伟大意义，真正自觉地站到毛主席的革命路线上来。但是，当时有的干部还存在着种种顾虑，不敢到革命群众中去。怎么办呢？我们就主动要他们到群众中来，和同学们同吃、同住、同革命。
    当干部到群众中来以后，我们从政治上耐心帮助，从思想上严格要求，从生活上热情照顾他们。我们还根据各个人的特点，用不同的方式对他们进行帮助。
    主要是根据他们存在的思想问题，和他们一起学习“老三篇”、《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作及有关群众路线的语录，同时对他们大讲革命形势，大讲党的政策，要他们自觉地认识对待群众运动的错误态度，批判自己的私心杂念，促使他们感到过去确实保了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对不起毛主席，对不起党的培养教育，进而要求起来揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶，决心回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    对犯有严重错误的干部，我们也同样按照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针办事。有一个干部在无产阶级文化大革命中，曾和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派干了不少坏事。当他被群众揭发出来后，自己觉得没有什么指望了，情绪非常消沉。我们根据毛主席关于怎样识别干部的教导，对他进行了全面的分析。他出身很苦，入党二十多年，工作一直勤勤恳恳。在文化大革命中，他虽然站错了队，执行了资产阶级反动路线，但只要我们工作做到家，他一定能转变过来。所以我们就和他一块回忆家史，回忆他跟着毛主席干革命的历史，鼓舞他改正错误的勇气，并主动地去做他的家属工作，通过他的家属写信给他，劝他“从思想深处找根源，不要怕疼。”同学们还针对他的活思想同他一起学习《毛主席语录》。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”经过这样耐心细致的工作，这个同志终于深刻批判了自己的错误，从资产阶级反动路线的泥坑中拔出脚来，大杀回马枪，彻底揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶，取得了群众的谅解和信任。
    经过两个多月的工作，干部的思想状况发生了根本变化。过去干部怕到群众中来，现在干部都主动地要求和群众同吃、同住、同革命。“三同”改善了干部与群众的关系，缩短了干部与群众的距离，使干部在群众运动的洪炉中烧掉自己的错误，改变了立场，回到毛主席的革命路线上来了。
    鼓励真正站到革命群众一边的干部大杀回马枪
    毛主席教导我们：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”干部有了改正错误的勇气和决心，就要求在群众面前彻底揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶，要求检查自己的错误。我们经过充分准备，召开了炮打院党委大会。这既是揭深批透斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大会，也是犯了错误而要革命的干部大杀回马枪的大会。参加了这个大会的一个干部深有所感地说：“五十天来，两头开了两个大会，我两个晚上没睡着觉。第一个大会，批判我所执行的资产阶级反动路线，想起自己所犯的错误，思想斗争很激烈，睡不着觉。在五十天的‘同吃、同住、同革命’中，由于同志们的耐心帮助，使我回到了毛主席身边。这次参加炮打院党委大会，我杀了个回马枪，表明了我继续革命的决心，同志们敲锣打鼓把我迎了回来，我兴奋激动得睡不着觉，我从心坎里感谢毛主席的关怀，感谢革命同志的帮助。”
    为了促使还在动摇中的干部缩短反复时间，我们请早起来革命的干部向他们做工作，用亲身体会来现身说法，先进帮后进，后进赶先进。这就使越来越多的干部迅速地回到了毛主席的革命路线一边，站到革命群众一边。
    在解决干部问题的过程中，我们深深地体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力，在改造客观世界的同时也改造了自己的主观世界，并且具体懂得了“政策和策略是党的生命”这一光辉真理。
