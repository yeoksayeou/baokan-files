Hanoi citizens from various sectors recently held a grand rally to commemorate the 17th anniversary of Vietnam's National Day of Resistance against the Americans (March 19). The resolution passed at the meeting called on the Vietnamese people to carry forward the spirit of decisive victory on the National Day of Resistance against the Americans, to realize Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call for resistance against the Americans and national salvation, to resolutely defeat the American aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately reunify the country.

Leaders of various Vietnamese mass organizations, including Nguyen Quoc Vu, Son Quang Phai, Chen Mingxuan, and Li Tingtan, attended the meeting. Nguyen Van Tin, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in the North, also attended the meeting.

Son Quang Phai, chairman of the Vietnam Asia-Africa Peoples' Solidarity Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that recently, American imperialism has again escalated the war, attempting to use force to make the Vietnamese people surrender and realize its aggressive plot. However, its violence cannot shake the Vietnamese people's resolve for decisive victory.

He said, "Chairman Ho Chi Minh has said: 'The Vietnamese people love peace, love true peace, peace based on independence and freedom, not false peace, American-style 'peace.' To defend the country's independence, to fulfill the duty to the nations fighting against American imperialism, our entire people and army are united, unafraid of hardship and sacrifice, and will fight to the final victory.' Son Quang Phai said, the Vietnamese people will carry forward the heroic tradition of the National Day of Resistance against the Americans, resolve to deal heavier blows to American imperialism, and drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory.

Nguyen Van Tin, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in North Vietnam, also spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that at present, American imperialism is carrying out extremely adventurous and dangerous new war escalations. The number one war criminal, Johnson, is about to hold a "war conference" with American military and political leaders in Guam to expand and intensify the war in Vietnam. Nguyen Van Tin said, all the aggressive actions of American imperialism will inevitably meet their deserved punishment. The military and people of South Vietnam, who have achieved great victories in the winter and spring, will fight even harder to seize more glorious victories.

    越南人民决心把美国强盗赶出国土
    河内各界人民集会纪念越南全国反美斗争日
    新华社河内十八日电　河内市各界人民代表最近隆重集会，纪念越南全国反美斗争日（三月十九日）十七周年。大会通过的决议号召越南人民发扬“三·一九”全国反美斗争日的决战决胜精神，实现胡志明主席的抗美救国号召，坚决战胜美国侵略强盗，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国。
    越南各群众团体负责人黄国越、孙光阀、陈名宣、黎廷探等出席了大会。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻北方代表团团长阮文进也出席了大会。
    越南亚非人民团结委员会主席孙光阀在大会上作了报告。他指出，最近，美帝国主义又进行了新的战争“升级”，妄图用武力迫使越南人民屈服，以实现它的侵略阴谋。但是，它的暴力绝不能动摇越南人民的决战决胜意志。
    他说，胡志明主席说过：“越南人民十分热爱和平，热爱真正的和平，在独立、自由基础上的和平，而不是假和平、美国式的
  ‘和平’。为了保卫祖国的独立，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”孙光阀说，越南人民将发扬全国反美斗争日的英雄传统，决心给美帝国主义以更加沉重的打击，把美国强盗赶出越南国土。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进也在会上讲了话。他指出，目前，美帝国主义正在进行极其冒险和危险的新的战争“升级”。头号战犯约翰逊又即将在关岛与美国军政头目召开“战争会议”，以扩大和加强侵越战争。阮文进说，美帝国主义的一切侵略行动都必将遭到应得的惩罚。在冬春取得了巨大胜利的越南南方军民，必将打得更狠，以夺取更多的辉煌胜利。
