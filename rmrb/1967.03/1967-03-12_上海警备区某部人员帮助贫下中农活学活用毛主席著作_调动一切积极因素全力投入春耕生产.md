At the call of Chairman Mao, thousands of troops rush to spring farming. The comrades from the cavalry unit of a certain unit in the Shanghai Garrison District have firmly responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have raised high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and rushed to the front lines of spring farming. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings that the army is not only a fighting force but also a work force and a production force. While working, they help the poor and lower-middle peasants study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thinking of cadres and the masses, and to the greatest extent mobilize all positive factors to launch a new high tide of spring farming.

Upon arriving at the Miao Jing Brigade of Cheng Zhen Commune in Chuan Sha County, they first conducted thorough investigations and research. Through the investigation, they found that the brigade had "three airs": some cadres were upset after being criticized or struggled; the proletarian revolutionary factions had some anger towards the cadres; and the masses were discouraged because there was no one to lead production. The existence of these "three airs" seriously affected the spring farming of the entire brigade. How to solve this problem? Everyone agreed that Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power; one sentence is worth ten thousand. As long as we arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to unify the thinking of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, while vigorously propagating the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution and promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas," they inspired and encouraged the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres to actively participate in spring farming. At the same time, they addressed different active thoughts and helped the masses launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

They organized cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling criticism and the editorials in the newspapers on the issue of "putting down the burden and rising up in rebellion," encouraging them to correctly handle criticism from the masses; not to carry burdens, but to stand tall, lighten their load, and grasp revolution and promote production. They organized proletarian revolutionary factions to study "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" and the editorial in the "Red Flag" magazine of 1967, Issue 4, "Must Correctly Handle Cadres." They educated them to conduct class analysis of cadres, not to indiscriminately oppose and overthrow them; to adopt the attitude of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the person" towards those who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them, and to work together with them. They organized the broad masses to study "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and the letter from the Central Committee, making them realize that the poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for "grasping revolution and promoting production" in the countryside and should truly play the role of the main force.

Due to the cavalry unit's comrades' great help in assisting the poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the thinking of the people in Miao Jing Brigade has undergone a profound change, effectively promoting their "three-in-one combination" to form a new leadership team. The original "three airs" quickly changed to new "three airs": cadres have courage. They dare to lead the masses in grasping revolution and promoting production. For example, the brigade party secretary, Hu Yuebao, works with everyone during the day and takes on the heaviest and dirtiest tasks. At night, he organizes cadres to study Chairman Mao's works and discuss spring farming issues. The proletarian revolutionary factions have ambition. They actively support the work of revolutionary cadres, strive to unite with cadres who have made mistakes, and are determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production. For example, the rebel faction member and poor peasant, Xie Jincai, actively proposes suggestions and ideas, and discusses production issues with revolutionary cadres. He said, "Cadres make revolution, support is our duty, and fighting side by side guarantees victory." The broad masses of community members are full of vigor. They are enthusiastic about making revolution and are full of energy to promote spring farming. People have changed, and everything has changed. The attendance rate has increased, and labor time has increased. The entire brigade's wheat and rapeseed have all been fertilized, and 90% of the irrigation canal construction task has been completed. Of the seven canal bridges to be built, five have been completed. All preparatory and spring farming work is being carried out in an orderly and tense manner.

The comrades' approach of prioritizing ideology and grasping the root cause has been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary cadres and masses.

    上海警备区某部人员帮助贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作
    调动一切积极因素全力投入春耕生产
    本报讯　毛主席一声号令，万马千军闹春耕。上海警备区某部驯马队的同志坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，奔赴春耕生产第一线。他们牢记毛主席关于军队既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的教导，一边劳动，一边帮助贫下中农社员活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统一广大干部和广大群众的思想，最大限度地调动一切积极因素，掀起春耕生产新高潮。
    他们一到川沙县城镇公社妙境大队，首先进行了深入细致的调查研究。通过调查，发现队里存在着“三气”：有的干部受到批评或斗争想不通，有些怨气；无产阶级革命派对干部有些火气；群众因生产无人领导，有些泄气。这“三气”的存在，严重地影响了全大队的春耕生产。这个问题怎么解决？大家一致认为：毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，一句顶一万句；只要我们用毛泽东思想武装群众，就一定能够把广大贫下中农社员的思想统一起来。因此，他们一面大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”指示的伟大意义，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，启发和鼓舞广大贫下中农和干部，积极投入春耕生产；一面针对不同的活思想，帮助群众掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    他们组织干部学习毛主席有关正确对待批评的教导和报纸上有关放下包袱，起来造反问题的社论，鼓励他们正确对待群众的批评；不要背包袱，要挺直腰杆，轻装上阵，狠抓革命，猛促生产。组织无产阶级革命派学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和《红旗》杂志一九六七年第四期社论《必须正确地对待干部》。教育他们对干部要进行阶级分析，不要不分青红皂白，一概反对，一概打倒；对于犯了错误但愿意改正的干部要采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的态度，团结他们一道工作。组织广大群众学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》以及中共中央的信，使他们认识到贫下中农是农村中“抓革命，促生产”的主力军，要真正地起到主力军的作用。
    由于驯马队同志大力帮助贫下中农社员活学活用毛主席著作，使妙境大队群众的思想面貌发生了深刻的变化，有力地促进了他们的“三结合”，组成新的领导班子。原来的“三气”迅速变化为新的“三气”：干部有勇气。他们敢字当头，抛弃私心杂念，领导群众抓革命、促生产。如大队支部书记胡月宝白天和大家一块劳动，在劳动中专挑重活脏活干。晚上组织干部学习毛主席著作，研究春耕生产问题。无产阶级革命派有志气。他们积极支持革命干部工作，争取和团结犯了错误的干部，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。如造反队队员、贫农谢进财，主动提建议，出主意，和革命干部商量生产问题。他说：“干部闹革命，支持是本分，并肩同战斗，胜利有保证。”广大社员群众有朝气。他们热气腾腾闹革命，鼓足干劲促春耕。人变了，一切都变了，出工率提高了，劳动时间增多了。全大队的小麦、油菜全部追了肥，兴修渠道的任务已完成了百分之九十，要兴建的七座渠道桥，已兴建好了五座，一切备耕、春耕工作正在紧张而有秩序地进行。
    驯马队的同志这种思想先行，狠抓根本的做法，受到了广大革命干部和革命群众的热烈欢迎。
