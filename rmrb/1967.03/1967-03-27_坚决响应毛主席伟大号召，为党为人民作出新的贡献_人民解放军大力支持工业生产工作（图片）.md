The People's Liberation Army is vigorously supporting industrial production work.

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, together with revolutionary workers, often hold study sessions on Chairman Mao's works at the Shandong New China Printing Factory. Comrade Li Zhimin, a Communist Party member and a model soldier, shared his insights on studying the article "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party" at the study session.

The troops stationed in Liaoyuan dispatched a large number of cadres and soldiers to the mining areas, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and together with the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, they focused on the revolution and vigorously promoted production. This is a scene of soldiers and revolutionary workers studying Chairman Mao's quotations before going down the mine.

Chairman Mao and the Central Committee decided that the People's Liberation Army would greatly assist the local areas and support industrial production work. This is the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the troops stationed in Beijing, which entered the Capital Steel Company to perform their own composed and sung programs, enthusiastically promoting Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production."

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the Changchun Automobile Manufacturing Factory to promote Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production." This is Gao Fulu, a third-class merit awardee and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works (on the right), who, while participating in labor, propagates Mao Zedong Thought to the workers.

In the work of supporting the broad revolutionary masses of the left in the Weihe Forestry Area of Heilongjiang Province, the soldiers of the unit where Liu Yingjun, who established new merits, formerly served, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp the revolution, promote production," and entered the forestry area to labor with the workers.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory, ate, lived, and worked with the worker comrades, striving to promote Mao Zedong Thought and establishing deep class feelings with the workers.
