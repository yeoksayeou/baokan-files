The Vietnam Fatherland Front Supports Two Statements by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
The U.S. Aggressors Will Surely Be Punished

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on March 3, local newspapers reported on March 3 that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on March 2. The statement warmly supports the two statements issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28 and the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry on March 1. The statement also points out that if the U.S. aggressors continue their aggressive war, the Vietnamese people will resolutely counterattack with revolutionary war.

The statement, after exposing the deceitful tactics of U.S. imperialism in playing the so-called "peace talks," said: "As pointed out in the February 28 statement by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the 'peace' rhetoric of the Johnson clique is nothing but a trick. Its actual actions are to intensify and expand the war, and its plot is to stubbornly stay in South Vietnam and permanently divide Vietnam."

The statement fully supports the February 28, 1967, statement by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the March 1, 1967, statement by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It also strongly condemns and denounces to the domestic and international public opinion the plots and heinous war crimes of U.S. imperialism.

The statement calls on all compatriots to strengthen their resolve to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors, overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifices, and thoroughly implement Chairman Hu's call on July 17, 1966, to fight resolutely to final victory, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country.

The statement says: "Southern compatriots should advance and smash all aggressive plans of U.S. imperialism, achieving more and greater victories. Northern compatriots should vigorously promote production and fight bravely, overcoming all new 'escalations' of the U.S. imperialist war, determined to fulfill their duty as the rear base for the flesh-and-blood South."

The statement says: "No matter what brutal and cunning tactics U.S. imperialism employs, it will never shake the resolve of the 31 million Vietnamese people."

The statement says: "If the U.S. aggressors continue their aggressive war, the Vietnamese people will resolutely counterattack with revolutionary war and give them the punishment they deserve."

The statement points out: "The best way out for the U.S. government is to acknowledge the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to unconditionally and permanently stop bombing, strafing, and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to withdraw all U.S. aggressor troops and their accomplices from South Vietnam, to acknowledge the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, and to let the Vietnamese people resolve their internal affairs themselves."

    越祖国战线支持南越民族解放阵线和越外交部两项声明
    美国侵略者必将得到应有的惩罚
    据新华社河内三日电　据这里报纸三日报道：越南祖国战线中央委员会二日发表一项声明。声明热烈支持越南南方民族解放阵线二月二十八日和越南外交部三月一日的两项声明，并且指出，美国侵略者如果继续进行侵略战争，越南人民就坚决用革命战争来回击。
    声明在揭露美帝国主义玩弄所谓“和平谈判”的欺骗手段后说：“正如越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会二月二十八日声明所指出的，约翰逊集团的‘和平’论调只不过是一个骗局，它的实际行动是加强和扩大战争，它的阴谋是死赖在越南南方，长期分割越南。”
    声明表示完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六七年二月二十八日的声明和越南民主共和国外交部一九六七年三月一日的声明，并向国内和世界舆论严厉谴责和控诉美帝国主义的阴谋和罪恶滔天的侵略战争行动。
    声明号召全国同胞，为了祖国的独立和自由，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族的应尽义务，为了印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平，加强决战决胜美国侵略强盗的意志，坚决克服一切困难，不怕牺牲，彻底实现胡主席一九六六年七月十七日的号召，坚决战斗到彻底胜利，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    声明说：“南方同胞要乘胜前进，粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略计划，夺取更多更大的胜利。北方同胞要大力促进生产和奋勇战斗，战胜美帝国主义的一切新的战争‘升级’，决心完成自己作为骨肉南方的大后方的应尽义务。”
    声明说：“不管美帝国主义玩弄什么残暴和狡猾手段，也绝对不能动摇三千一百万越南人民的决心。”
    声明说：“美国侵略者如果继续进行侵略战争，越南人民就坚决以革命战争来回击，坚决给予应得的惩罚。”
    声明指出：“美国政府的最好出路，就是必须承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，必须无条件和永远地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射和其它一切战争行动，必须把美国侵略军和它的帮凶军从越南南方全部撤走，必须承认越南南方人民的唯一真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线，必须让越南人民自己解决自己的内部事务。”
