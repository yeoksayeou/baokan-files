Revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Wusong Commune in Shanghai's Baoshan County are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They use Mao Zedong Thought to break through the theory of predestination, fully exert subjective initiative, and with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they turn disadvantages into advantages and advantages into greater advantages, promoting the field management of summer crops.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary people and revolutionary cadres of Wusong Commune have striven to implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," promoting the development of production. However, this commune was previously influenced by the counter-revolutionary economic wind, with some production teams experiencing labor force outflow; some teams were also influenced by the reactionary trend of overthrowing everything and excluding everything, with some cadres' thoughts in a state of confusion, and they did not grasp production leadership tightly; in addition, after the beginning of spring, the low temperatures and frequent snowfall were not conducive to the normal growth of summer crops. Thus, this commune's production showed some imbalances. In some production brigades and teams where production was relatively poor, cadres and community members developed the idea that the situation was already set and that no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't achieve much; while in some production brigades and teams where production was relatively good, cadres and community members thought they could relax.

Revolutionary leading cadres of Wusong Commune, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "eliminate the heavy blindness in our Party, we must advocate thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and cultivate the habit of analysis," realized that to strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops, they must overcome some cadres' and community members' blind pessimism and blind optimism, turn around the idea of predestination, and grasp the field management of summer crops, focusing on the "struggle." Only in this way can they achieve better and greater results in production and ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops and the entire year's agricultural production. They studied together with revolutionary cadres and community members of production brigades and teams Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Put Down Your Burdens and Start the Machine," as well as relevant quotations on ideological and work methods, and repeatedly studied the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and All Levels of Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." Through study, the broad revolutionary cadres and community members further realized that whether this year's agricultural production is good or not is not only a production issue but more importantly a political issue, directly related to the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The idea that the current field management of summer crops and production-increasing measures cannot be achieved or that there is nothing to strive for is wrong and must be overcome.

The summer crop field management of Zhangjialing Production Brigade was originally lagging behind other teams. After study, revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of community members had their minds enlightened. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "in times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see light, and raise our courage," and united as one to apply fertilizer to all the wheat and rapeseed fields in the entire brigade and loosen the soil. Now, the percentage of third-grade seedlings in the entire brigade's wheat has decreased from the original 20% to 6%, and the percentage of third-grade seedlings in rapeseed has decreased from the original 24% to 14%.

After breaking through the theory of predestination in their minds and viewing problems with a dialectical approach, striving for increase, and grasping the key measures for increasing summer crop production, the entire commune's production situation has undergone significant changes. The percentage of third-grade seedlings in wheat and rapeseed has significantly decreased, and achievements have been made in accumulating and producing fertilizer, creating better conditions for achieving an overall bumper harvest in this year's agricultural production.

    吴淞公社广大革命干部和贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作打破定局论
    发挥主观能动作用　狠抓夏熟作物管理
    据新华社上海二十五日电　上海市宝山县吴淞公社广大革命干部和贫下中农社员，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来打破定局观点，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，变不利为有利，变有利为更有利，促进了夏熟作物的田间管理工作。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，吴淞公社的广大革命群众和革命干部，努力贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，促进了生产的发展。但是，这个公社前一时期由于受到反革命经济主义黑风的影响，有的生产队劳动力有些外流；少数队还受到打倒一切、排斥一切反动思潮的影响，一部分干部思想较为混乱，对领导生产抓得不紧；加上立春以后低温多雪，对夏熟作物的正常生长不利。这样，这个公社的生产一度出现了一些不平衡的现象。在有些生产搞得较差的生产大队和生产队里，干部、社员中产生了大局已定，再抓也抓不出什么名堂来的思想；而有些生产搞得较好的生产大队和生产队的干部和社员，则产生了可以松口气的思想。
    吴淞公社的革命领导干部按照毛主席“要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯”的教导，认识到要争取夏熟作物丰收，必须从思想上克服一些干部和社员中盲目悲观和盲目乐观的情绪，扭转定局思想，狠抓夏熟作物的田间管理，在“争”字上下功夫。只有这样，才能在生产上创造出更好更大的成绩，确保夏熟作物和全年农业生产的丰收。他们同生产大队和生产队的革命干部和社员一起学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章以及有关思想方法和工作方法的语录，并且反复学习《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。通过学习，使广大革命干部和社员进一步认识到，今年农业生产搞得好不好，不仅是一个生产问题，更重要的是一个政治问题，直接关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行和无产阶级政权的巩固。那种认为当前夏熟作物田间管理和增产措施争不上去，或没什么可争的定局观点，都是错误的，必须克服。
    张家弄生产大队夏熟作物的田间管理本来落在别队的后面。革命干部和广大社员经过学习后，思想豁然开朗。他们遵循毛主席的“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，同心协力，对全大队的三麦、油菜田普遍施了追肥，并且松了土。现在，全大队的三麦三类苗已由原来的百分之二十下降到百分之六，油菜三类苗已由原来的百分之二十四下降到百分之十四。
    吴淞公社的广大革命干部和社员从思想上破除定局论，以一分为二的观点看问题，以“争”求“增”，狠抓夏熟作物增产的关键性措施以后，整个公社的生产面貌发生了很大变化，三麦、油菜的三类苗大大下降，积肥、造肥也取得了很大成绩，为夺取今年农业生产的全面丰收创造了更好条件。
