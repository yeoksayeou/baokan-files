The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson commented on U Thant's recent attempts to intervene in the Vietnamese issue, emphasizing that the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in any way with the Vietnamese issue.

The spokesperson made the comments in response to a request from a Vietnam News Agency reporter regarding a message from the United Nations News Agency in New Delhi, India, which quoted U Thant as saying: "Hanoi regards this hostile action as a civil war in South Vietnam, with Hanoi aiding one side and the United States aiding the other. Hanoi believes that if the United States is willing to withdraw its support for Saigon, there would be a possibility of taking corresponding actions."

Recently, Western news sources have revealed that U Thant proposed a solution to the Vietnamese issue. The content of this proposal is to call for a complete ceasefire, followed by a preliminary meeting of some relevant parties to discuss the reconvening of the Geneva Conference, and finally to reconvene the Geneva Conference.

The spokesperson of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry said: The United States is invading South Vietnam and bombing and shelling the Vietnamese Democratic Republic. The Vietnamese people are the victims of aggression; this is a fact as clear as day. The whole world strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist war of aggression and strongly supports the Vietnamese people's patriotic struggle. The news from the United Nations News Agency does not reflect the actual situation in Vietnam and is contrary to the views of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government. Because the United States is invading Vietnam, the correct way to resolve the Vietnamese issue is for the United States to stop its aggression. This is the essence of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government's four-point proposal and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The people of the world fully support this just position.

At a time when the United States is invading Vietnam and escalating its military actions in both regions of Vietnam, to demand a ceasefire and unconditional negotiations from both sides is to not distinguish between the aggressor and the victim, to be detached from reality, and to demand that the Vietnamese people accept the conditions of the aggressor.

Incidentally, it is necessary to reiterate the position of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government. The Vietnamese Democratic Republic government believes that the Vietnamese issue has nothing to do with the United Nations; the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in any way with the Vietnamese issue.

The Vietnamese Democratic Republic Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to a Vietnam News Agency reporter on March 27, commented on the U.S. publication of documents regarding the so-called "25 peace efforts" and "5 suspensions of bombing," stating that this is another trick the United States is playing to extricate itself from its political predicament.

The spokesperson pointed out: "The United States attempts to confuse right and wrong. However, no matter how many times the United States publishes its 'peace efforts'—whether 15, 25, or 100—they cannot cover up the fact that nearly 500,000 U.S. expeditionary forces are occupying South Vietnam; it is the United States that has committed heinous crimes against humanity in Vietnam, crazily intensifying and expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, seriously threatening peace in Southeast Asia and the world; it is the United States that is seriously violating the independence, sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos, shamelessly violating the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Indochina issue and the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue."

The spokesperson said: "The so-called 'peace initiatives' of the United States are, in fact, just a rehash of the old tune of conditional cessation of bombing of North Vietnam, unconditional discussions, gradual de-escalation, and ceasefire. This is the language of bandits, equating the aggressor with the victim, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender to the U.S. aggressors."

The spokesperson said: The U.S. ruling clique also shouts about the so-called "five suspensions of bombing North Vietnam" to cover up their serious war "escalation" activities in the Vietnamese Democratic Republic and to deceive public opinion.

The spokesperson concluded: "The U.S. publication of documents regarding the so-called '25 peace efforts' and 'five suspensions of bombing North Vietnam' further exposes the U.S.'s obstinate and treacherous nature of aggression to public opinion, which will make it subject to even stronger condemnation and further isolation."

    越南外交部发言人就吴丹最近的活动发表评论说
    联合国绝对无权干涉越南问题
    发言人揭露美帝用“和平”烟幕掩盖扩大战争行动的新诡计
    新华社河内三十日电 据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十七日应一位越南通讯社记者的要求，就联合国秘书长吴丹最近企图插手越南问题发表评论，强调指出：联合国绝对没有权利以任何方式干涉越南问题。
    发言人是就下列消息发表评论的：新德里（印度）联合国新闻处一九六七年三月六日出版的新闻公报第二十四期里引用联合国秘书长吴丹的话说：“河内把这场敌对行动看成是南越的一场内战，而河内帮助一方，美国帮助另一方。河内认为，如若美国愿意撤销对西贡的支持，那就会有采取相应行动的可能性。”
    最近，西方消息还透露，吴丹提出了一项解决越南问题的办法。这项办法的内容是呼吁全面停火，停火后，由一些有关方面举行一次预备会议讨论重新召开日内瓦会议，最后重新召开日内瓦会议。
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人说：美国在侵略越南南方，在轰炸和炮击越南民主共和国，越南人民是被侵略者，这是明同白昼的事实。全世界都强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略战争和大力支持越南人民的爱国斗争。联合国新闻处的消息不符合越南的实际情况，是同越南民主共和国政府的观点相反的。由于美国在侵略越南，解决越南问题的正确途径，是美国必须停止它的侵略。这是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明的基本精神。世界人民完全支持这一正义立场。
    在美国对越南进行侵略的时候，在美国在越南的两个地区进行严重的军事升级的时候，要求双方停火和举行无条件谈判，就是不区别侵略者和被侵略者，就是脱离现实，就是要求越南人民接受侵略者的条件。
    顺便说一下：有必要再次强调越南民主共和国政府的观点。越南民主共和国政府认为，越南问题同联合国没有关系；联合国绝对没有权利以任何方式干涉越南问题。
    新华社河内三十日电据越南通讯社报道：越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十七日在接见越南通讯社记者时所作的回答中，就美国公布关于美国的所谓“二十五次和平努力”和“五次暂停轰炸”的文件，发表评论指出：这是美国企图摆脱其政治上被动地位而玩弄的又一个诡计。
    发言人指出：“美国妄图颠倒黑白。但是，不管美国公布多少次——十五次、二十五次、一百次——美国式的‘和平努力’，它都掩盖不了如下的事实：将近五十万美国远征军占领着越南南方；正是美国在越南对人类犯下了滔天罪行，疯狂地加剧和扩大它对越南的侵略战争，严重地威胁东南亚和世界和平；正是美国在严重地侵犯柬埔寨王国和老挝王国的独立、主权、中立和领土完整，无耻地破坏一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议和一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。”
    发言人说：“美国的所谓‘和平倡议’，事实上不过是所谓有条件停止轰炸越南北方、无条件讨论、双方逐步降级和停火等老调的翻新。这是强盗的语言，它把侵略者和被侵略者相提并论，妄图迫使越南人民向美国侵略者投降。”
    发言人说：美国统治集团还叫嚷所谓“五次暂停轰炸越南北方”，以此来掩盖他们对越南民主共和国的严重战争“升级”活动和欺骗舆论。
    发言人最后说：“美国公布关于所谓‘二十五次和平努力’和‘五次暂停轰炸北越’的文件的阴谋，进一步向舆论暴露了美国的顽固阴险的侵略本性，这将使它受到舆论更加强烈的谴责并使它更加陷于孤立。”
