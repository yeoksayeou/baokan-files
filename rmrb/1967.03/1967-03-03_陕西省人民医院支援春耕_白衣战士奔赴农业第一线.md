Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital Supports Spring Plowing
White-Garmented Warriors Rush to the Agricultural Frontline

    The report from the *Message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in the Countryside* reached Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, and the broad revolutionary staff were overjoyed. They all applied to immediately rush to the countryside and, together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, fire the first shot of spring production, reporting the best results to Chairman Mao. They arranged the personnel, ensuring the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution and medical work in their unit, and immediately dispatched nearly seventy medical and health personnel to form a mobile medical team, rushing to the remote Shaanbei County of Shenmu, serving the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and supporting spring production.

    Before going down to the countryside, the revolutionary staff of this hospital used a few days to concentrate on studying Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas." They decided that after going to the countryside, they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, regard themselves as a force of the revolution, and also regard themselves as the object of the revolution. They would bravely carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls, break down the "self" and establish the "public," striving to change both the subjective and objective worlds. They would actively participate in the local Cultural Revolution, actively propagate the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, actively propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought, combine with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and humbly learn from them.

    陕西省人民医院支援春耕
    白衣战士奔赴农业第一线
    本报讯　《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》传到陕西省人民医院，广大革命职工欢欣鼓舞。他们纷纷提出申请，要求立即奔赴农村，和广大贫下中农一起，打响春耕生产第一炮，用最好的成绩向毛主席汇报。他们对人员作了安排，除了保证搞好本单位的文化大革命和医疗工作外，立即抽出近七十名医疗卫生人员，组成巡回医疗队，奔赴最边远的陕北神木县，为广大贫下中农服务，支援春耕生产。
    这个医院革命派职工在下农村以前，利用几天时间集中学习了毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示。他们决心到农村以后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要把自己当作革命的对象，勇于在自己灵魂深处闹革命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，努力改造主观世界和客观世界。积极参加当地文化大革命，积极宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，积极宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，与广大的贫下中农结合，虚心向贫下中农学习。
