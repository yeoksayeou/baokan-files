The PLA's fine traditions are brought to the factory
The mass work team of the Shanxi Military Region stationed at the Taiyuan Textile Factory vigorously propagates Mao Zedong Thought, spreads the PLA's experience and style, and the revolutionary spirit of all workers in the factory is greatly boosted, and the revolutionary and production situation is completely renewed.

The Shanxi Military Region's mass work team stationed at the Taiyuan Textile Factory vigorously propagates Mao Zedong Thought and the PLA's political work experience and the Three-Eight Style, assisting the proletarian revolutionary faction in firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production, making the spiritual outlook of all workers in the factory completely renewed and the production situation flourishing.

During the Cultural Revolution, the former factory party committee, which took the capitalist road, colluded with a small clique of reactionaries, using the name of the "Red Guards" to deceive some unaware masses, forming a reactionary organization, and doing everything possible to suppress and attack the revolutionary masses. In late January, when the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders in the factory party committee, this reactionary conservative force launched a fierce counterattack against the revolutionary faction. The entire factory's production was seriously affected. At this critical moment, the Shanxi Military Region sent this mass work team.

Arming Workers' Minds with Mao Zedong Thought

After entering the factory, the mass work team extensively and deeply propagated Mao Zedong Thought, arming the broad masses of workers with Mao Zedong Thought. For example, at that time, the most urgent problem was to dissolve the reactionary organization and educate and win over the deceived masses. However, some comrades in the revolutionary mass organization, the Red Guards, did not grasp the Party's policies and strategies well and did not pay attention to distinguishing between the few reactionaries in the reactionary organization and the broad masses who were deceived. The PLA soldiers helped them study Chairman Mao's relevant writings, making them realize that they should conduct a class analysis of the members of the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards," distinguish between them, win over and unite the majority, and completely isolate the few ringleaders. Some comrades in the Red Guards regarded themselves as victors and adopted a contemptuous and discriminatory attitude towards the general masses of the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards," which was not conducive to dissolving the reactionary organization. The PLA soldiers helped them study the relevant quotations from Chairman Mao's works, making them realize: "The attitude towards backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." The policy level of the revolutionary faction improved, and the PLA soldiers cooperated with them to launch a powerful political offensive against the reactionary organization, on the one hand, publicly exposing and criticizing the crimes of the capitalist-roaders and the ringleaders in the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards," and on the other hand, patiently and meticulously persuading and educating the deceived workers.

Bringing Political Work Experience to the Revolutionary Faction

The former factory party committee, which took the capitalist road, long neglected ideological and political work, relying only on administrative orders and material incentives. The Shanxi Military Region's mass work team brought the PLA's political work experience into the factory, passing it on to the revolutionary faction through words and deeds. The workers said, "This is a priceless treasure brought by the PLA." At the beginning of the mass work team's entry into the factory, some deceived masses in the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards" had not yet realized their mistakes, had antagonistic feelings towards the Red Guards, and, instigated by reactionaries, adopted a passive attitude towards production. After learning about this, the mass work team ate, studied, and worked with them, patiently explaining the policies to them according to their active thoughts, educating them to work hard for the revolution. The work team also held separate symposiums with old workers and workers of poor and lower-middle peasant origin in the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards," inspiring them to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, conducting class education for them, and helping them draw a clear line between themselves and the capitalist-roaders and the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the influence of the PLA soldiers, the Red Guards also did ideological work. The Red Guards found deceived workers in the workshops, dormitories, and canteens for heart-to-heart talks, patiently doing persuasive and educational work according to their confused ideas and mental concerns. For example, someone who withdrew from the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards" was scolded as a "traitor" by some people and was also worried that withdrawing from the "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards" would not be trusted by the revolutionary organization. The Red Guards used big-character posters and other forms to warmly welcome the repentant workers. The Red Guards in the spinning, fine spinning, and finishing workshops also held heart-to-heart meetings with these awakened class brothers. At the meeting, the Red Guards took the initiative to check their own shortcomings, such as being too rigid in attitude; the originally deceived workers checked their own past mistakes, checked their erroneous thoughts of wanting to outdo the Red Guards in production after the Red Guards seized power, and expressed their determination to work together with the Red Guards to do a good job in the revolution and production.

Assisting the Revolutionary Faction in Establishing a New Revolutionary Order

This mass work team also actively assisted the revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, uniting some revolutionary leading cadres, and establishing a temporary power organ of the "three-in-one combination" for the entire factory. Each workshop also had both revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres participating in the leadership work. In this way, the production command system of the entire factory had strong leadership from top to bottom. The PLA soldiers also helped the revolutionary faction to rectify and improve the militia organization, carry out militia activities, and cultivate a spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness among the workers. The phenomenon of some workers having loose discipline has been reversed. The mass work team also actively supported the masses' pioneering spirit, assisting the revolutionary faction in planning to break old and establish new in aspects such as organizations and systems, breaking the old frameworks that shackle productivity, and establishing a new management system that can give full play to the masses' enthusiasm for production.

This PLA mass work team brought thought, experience, and style to the Taiyuan Textile Factory, bringing the fine traditions of the people's army, personally created and cultivated by Chairman Mao, into the factory, using the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize people's positive factors, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to cleanse the capitalist and revisionist mud and dirt in the enterprise. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will exert boundless power. The once rampant reactionary organization has already collapsed. The vast majority of the masses have already stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a small clique of capitalist-roaders has been completely isolated. The entire factory has seen a surge in the study of Chairman Mao's works. The spiritual outlook of the workers has undergone a major change, and production enthusiasm has greatly increased. The broad masses of workers actively think of ways and take measures, and many people voluntarily request to expand machines and increase workload, striving to make up the production that was once lost as soon as possible. The production level of the entire factory is rising steadily. In February, the state plan was overfulfilled, and the quality was also improved compared to January. Now, the broad revolutionary masses are united, determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, and complete the production tasks better, faster, more, and more economically. (With a picture)

PLA soldiers from a certain unit of the Shanxi Military Region actively organize revolutionary workers in the Taiyuan Textile Factory to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, arming the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the PLA and revolutionary workers studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together.

    把解放军的优良传统带到工厂去
    山西省军区驻太原纺织厂群众工作队，大力宣传毛泽东思想，传播解放军的经验和作风，全厂职工革命精神大振，革命、生产面貌一新
    本报讯　山西省军区驻太原纺织厂群众工作队，大力宣传毛泽东思想，大力传播解放军的政治工作经验和三八作风，协助无产阶级革命派狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全厂职工精神面貌焕然一新，生产呈现一片欣欣向荣的局面。
    太原纺织厂在文化大革命中，前厂党委内走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结一小撮反动分子，盗用“红卫兵”的名义，拉拢、欺骗一些不明真相的群众，成立了一个反动组织，千方百计地压制和打击革命群众。一月下旬，无产阶级革命派向厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，这股反动保守势力向革命派进行了猖狂反扑。全厂生产受到严重影响。就在这个关键时刻，山西省军区派来了这个群众工作队。
    用毛泽东思想武装职工头脑
    群众工作队进厂以后，就广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大职工。例如，当时面临的最迫切的问题，是瓦解反动组织，教育和争取受蒙蔽的群众。可是，刚刚掌权的革命群众组织红卫队中的部分同志，没有很好地掌握党的政策和策略，不注意区别对待反动组织中的极少数反动分子和受蒙蔽的广大群众。解放军指战员便帮助他们学习毛主席的有关论述，使他们认识到对反动组织“太纺红卫兵”的成员要进行阶级分析，区别对待，要争取和团结大多数，彻底孤立一小撮首恶分子。红卫队中有少数同志以胜利者自居，对于“太纺红卫兵”的一般群众采取轻视、歧视的态度，这也不利于瓦解反动组织。解放军指战员便帮助他们学习毛主席著作的有关语录，使他们认识到：“对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”革命派的政策水平提高了，解放军指战员便协同他们对反动组织展开了强大的政治攻势，一方面大张旗鼓地揭发批判走资本主义道路当权派和“太纺红卫兵”中首恶分子的罪行，一方面耐心细致地说服教育了受蒙蔽的职工。
    把政治工作经验传给革命派
    太原纺织厂前党委内的走资本主义道路的当权派，长期不做思想政治工作，只靠行政命令和物质刺激办事。山西省军区的群众工作队，把解放军的政治工作经验带进工厂，通过言传身教，传给了革命派。职工们说：“这是解放军带来的无价之宝。”群众工作队进厂之初，“太纺红卫兵”中一些受蒙蔽的群众，由于没有认识到自己的错误，同红卫队有对立情绪，加上反动分子的挑动，在生产上消极应付。群众工作队知道后就和他们同吃、同学习、同劳动，针对他们的活思想，耐心地向他们说明政策，教育他们要为革命努力生产。工作队还分别召集“太纺红卫兵”中的老工人、贫下中农出身的工人等开座谈会，启发他们忆苦思甜，对他们进行阶级教育，帮助他们同走资本主义道路当权派、同资产阶级反动路线划清界线。在解放军指战员的带动下，红卫队的战士也人人做思想工作。红卫队战士在车间、宿舍、食堂分别找受蒙蔽的职工促膝谈心，针对他们的糊涂认识和思想顾虑，耐心地做说服教育工作。例如，有人退出“太纺红卫兵”，被有的人斥为“叛徒”，还担心退出“太纺红卫兵”，得不到革命组织的信任，红卫队战士就用大字报等形式，对悔悟的职工表示热情欢迎。前纺、细纱、整理等车间的红卫队员，还和这些觉悟了的阶级兄弟开交心会。在会上，红卫队员带头主动检查态度生硬等缺点；原来受蒙蔽的职工则检查自己过去走错了路，检查自己在红卫队夺权以后消极对抗，想在生产上要红卫队的好看的错误思想，表示今后要和红卫队同心协力搞好革命，搞好生产。
    帮助革命派建立革命新秩序
    这个群众工作队还积极协助太原纺织厂的革命派贯彻毛主席的干部政策，联合了一些革命的领导干部，建立了全厂革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。各个车间也是既有革命群众，也有革命干部参加领导工作。这样，就使全厂的生产指挥系统从上到下有了强有力的领导。解放军指战员还帮助革命派整顿健全了民兵组织，开展了民兵活动，在职工中培养团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的作风。部分职工纪律松弛的现象已经扭转。群众工作队还积极支持群众的首创精神，协助革命派在机构、制度等方面有计划地破旧立新，打破束缚生产力的旧框框，建立能够发挥群众生产积极性的新的管理体制。
    这支解放军群众工作队在太原纺织厂传思想，传经验，传作风，把毛主席亲自缔造和培育的人民军队的优良传统带到工厂里来，用光芒万丈的毛泽东思想调动人的积极因素，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想荡涤企业中资产阶级、修正主义的污泥浊水。毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就发挥出无比的威力。曾经猖狂一时的反动组织，已经土崩瓦解。绝大部分群众已经站在毛主席的革命路线一边，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已经彻底孤立。全厂出现了学习毛主席著作的热潮。职工的精神面貌发生了重大的变化，生产积极性大大提高。广大职工积极想办法，提措施，不少人主动要求扩车扩台，增加工作量，力争尽快地把一度亏下的产量补起来。全厂生产水平节节上升。二月份，超额完成了国家计划，质量也比一月份提高了。现在，广大革命职工团结一致，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把生产任务完成得更多、更快、更好、更省。（附图片）
