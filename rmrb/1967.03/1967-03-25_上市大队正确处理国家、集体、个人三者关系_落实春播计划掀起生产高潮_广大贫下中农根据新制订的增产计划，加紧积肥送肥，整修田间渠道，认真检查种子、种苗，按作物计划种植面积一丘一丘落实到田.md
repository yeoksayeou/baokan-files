	Shangshi Brigade in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, has correctly handled the relationships among the state, collective, and individual, and has implemented the spring sowing plan, launching a new high tide of spring farming production. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the brigade have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have actively carried out democratic discussions, correctly handled the relationships among the state, collective, and individual, and have effectively implemented the spring sowing plan, launching a new high tide of spring farming production.

	At present, although the spring cold is still intense, the preparations for spring sowing are being carried out with great enthusiasm. The community members, based on the newly formulated production increase plan, are hurriedly gathering and transporting fertilizer, repairing field ditches, carefully inspecting seeds and seedlings, and implementing the planned planting areas for grains, cotton, and sugarcane, plot by plot, to the fields. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are full of confidence, saying: We will resolutely respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, become the main force for grasping revolution and promoting production, and with the spirit of masters, earnestly do a good job in spring farming production.

	This brigade not only produces grain but also cotton and sugarcane, providing the state with a large amount of grain and industrial raw materials every year. To make greater contributions to the state, since last winter, various production teams have repeatedly mobilized the masses to discuss and implement this year's production increase plan. The revolutionary masses of the poor and lower-middle peasants, with the spirit of masters, care about state affairs and collective affairs, and have put forward many rationalization suggestions on how to formulate this year's production increase plan from an overall perspective. However, in the process of democratically formulating the production plan, some incorrect ideological tendencies have emerged. Some people say that it doesn't matter whether the plan is formulated or not, as long as the masses decide, they can plant whatever they want; some, when formulating the plan, only calculate the economic accounts and not the political accounts, caring more about small collectives and less about large collectives; some cadres relax their leadership, dare not insist on principles, and become the tail of the backward masses. These incorrect ideas have temporarily affected the implementation of the production plan.

	After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," it has greatly encouraged the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shangshi Brigade. They have enthusiastically responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and have once again carried out democratic discussions to implement the production plan. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shangshi Brigade, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have repeatedly consulted Mao Zedong's works on the problems encountered in formulating the production plan. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to criticize various incorrect understandings. Through repeated study and democratic discussion, they have quickly unified their ideological understanding and ensured the rapid implementation of the production plan.

    上市大队正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系
    落实春播计划掀起生产高潮
    广大贫下中农根据新制订的增产计划，加紧积肥送肥，整修田间渠道，认真检查种子、种苗，按作物计划种植面积一丘一丘落实到田
    新华社南昌电 江西东乡县长林公社上市大队的贫下中农和革命干部，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，积极开展民主讨论，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系，很好地落实春播计划，掀起了春耕生产新高潮。
    目前，这里春寒正盛，可是春播准备工作搞得热气腾腾。社员们根据新制订出来的增产计划，正加紧积肥送肥，整修田间渠道，认真检查种子、种苗，按粮、棉、蔗等作物计划种植面积一丘一丘落实到田。广大贫下中农满怀信心地说：我们坚决响应毛主席、党中央的伟大号召，当好抓革命、促生产的主力军，以主人翁的精神，切实搞好春耕生产。
    这个大队既产粮食，又产棉花、甘蔗，每年向国家提供大量的粮食和工业原料。为了向国家作出更大贡献，去冬以来，各生产队曾先后两次发动群众反复讨论落实今年的增产计划。贫下中农革命派和革命群众以主人翁的精神，关心国家大事，关心集体大事，对如何从全局出发，制订好今年的增产计划，提出了许多合理化建议。但是，在民主制订生产计划的过程中，也出现了一些不正确的思想倾向。有人说，计划订不订无所谓，反正群众说了算，爱种什么就种什么；有的在订计划时，只算经济帐，不算政治帐，顾小集体多，顾大集体少；有的干部放松领导，不敢坚持原则，做了落后群众的尾巴。这些不正确思想曾一度影响到生产计划的落实。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表后，给了上市大队贫下中农巨大鼓舞，他们热烈响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，再次民主讨论落实生产计划。用毛泽东思想武装起来的上市大队贫下中农，针对制订生产计划中遇到的一些问题，反复请教毛主席著作。他们用毛泽东思想批判了形形色色的错误认识。通过反复学习，民主讨论，很快统一了思想认识，保证了生产计划的迅速落实。
