The harbor is ablaze with lights. The powerful searchlights on the dock, the flashing beacons on the buoys in the harbor, and the lights on the trains, trucks, and battery-powered vehicles rushing along the dock—all these lights flicker like shooting stars.

In this sea of lights, the night-shift workers at the harbor are battling intensely. Several cargo ships are being loaded and unloaded simultaneously, and multiple transportation lines are operating at the same time. Despite the enormous volume of goods being handled, there are no piles of cargo visible on the dock. Miracles are happening everywhere, and every revolutionary fighter of the proletariat proudly declares, "We, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, will always make Chairman Mao proud!" This is a harbor, with ships from all over the world docked here. Due to the increase in foreign trade tasks, starting from the beginning of this month, the volume of goods handled has exceeded normal levels by more than onefold. However, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat at the harbor have ensured the timely departure of ships.

As dawn approaches, Comrade Yang of the harbor revolutionary committee boards a foreign cargo ship. The ship has already been loaded and the hatches sealed. Comrade Yang looks at his watch and inwardly applauds, "Well done, excellent work!" Just as Comrade Yang is about to disembark, a sailor approaches him and shakes his hand firmly. This is a sailor from South America who frequently comes to this harbor with the ship. He and Comrade Yang are old acquaintances. He says:

"We are about to part ways again. This time, the ship's stay at the dock has been shortened."

"Didn't expect that, did you?" Comrade Yang asks with a smile.

"No, I did. Before coming to China, someone said, 'China is in chaos now, and there's no one to unload the cargo. You might have to stay docked for a year!' But I didn't believe it."

"Why not?"

"Although I knew little about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China before coming, I firmly believed in one thing: you have the great helmsman Chairman Mao leading the way, and the direction will not be wrong. Isn't there a line in the song that goes, 'Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman'? As a sailor, I can deeply understand the meaning of this line."

"Yes, with Chairman Mao leading the way, we can ride the winds and break through the waves, moving from victory to victory. Chinese workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and you've seen our actions, haven't you!"

The sailor excitedly says:

"I have, I have. When I return, I will tell everyone around me about what I've seen, about the profound significance of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and its great contribution to the world proletarian revolutionary cause." He pauses for a moment, looking a bit embarrassed, and says, "Friend, can you give me a Chairman Mao badge?"

He quickly explains, "It's not for me; I already have one. It's for my mother. She works in a cocoa plantation, where the big landowner ruthlessly exploits them. Before I came to China, I received a letter from her. It said, 'Although I live in the dark cocoa forests of South America, I can see the red sun rising in the East—that is the most revered teacher of the world's working class—Chairman Mao. When you happily set foot on the great land of China, please convey my sincere wishes to Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life. If possible, please ask the Chinese comrades for a Chairman Mao badge, which I will wear on my chest for the rest of my life...'"

Before he finishes, Comrade Yang immediately takes off the Chairman Mao badge he is wearing and hands it to the sailor.

"Please give this Chairman Mao badge to your respected mother," Comrade Yang says deeply. "This badge was made to commemorate the establishment of our city's revolutionary committee, and the back of the badge is engraved with the date of the committee's establishment."

"That makes it even more precious!" The sailor takes the badge from Comrade Yang and gazes at it for a long time under the light. Then, he carefully wraps it in a clean handkerchief and places it in his chest pocket...

The sky is bright, and the sun rises over the sea. The ship sets sail, and the sailor and his comrades on board sing songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao:

"Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman..."

The sailors on the tugboats, the dock workers, and the drivers of motor vehicles join in with powerful voices. This solemn song echoes over the sea, carried by the sea breeze to the vast horizon.

### 海港上的歌声

    海港上的歌声
    叶楠
    港口里一片灯光。那码头上的强光照明灯，港口中摇曳着的浮标闪光灯，还有那在码头上奔驰着的火车、汽车、电池车上的灯光，象流星似的闪烁着。
    在这灯火的海洋里，港口的夜班工人紧张地战斗着。几艘货轮同时在装卸货物，几条运输线同时在运转，偌么大的吞吐量，码头上却看不到堆积的货物。每一个地方都在出现奇迹，每一个无产阶级革命派战士都豪迈地说：“我们无产阶级革命派永远为毛主席他老人家争气！”这里是一个海港，停泊的航船来自世界各国。由于外贸任务的增加，从这个月的月初开始，货物吞吐量超过平时一倍还多，但是港口的无产阶级革命派却按时保证轮船的出港。
    天快亮的时候，港口革命委员会的老杨登上了一艘外国货轮的甲板。这条船已经装完货封好舱了。老杨看看表，心里暗暗喝采：“好样的，干得真利索！”老杨刚想下船，一个水手走到他面前，紧紧地握住他的手。这是一位南美洲籍的船员，他经常随船来到这里，他和老杨是老相识了。他说：
    “我们马上又要分别了，这一次船停码头的时间又缩短了。”
    “没想到吧？”老杨笑着问。
    “不，想到了。来中国的时候，有人说：‘中国现在很乱，货物根本没有人卸，你们准备靠上一年码头吧！’可是我不相信。”
    “为什么？”
    “虽然来以前，我对中国的无产阶级文化大革命知道得不多，但有一点我是坚信不移的，你们有伟大的舵手毛主席领航，航向是不会错的。歌子里不是有这一句么？——大海航行靠舵手。我作为一个海员工人，最能体会这句话的含意。”
      “对，有毛主席他老人家领航，我们就能乘风破浪，从胜利走向胜利。我们中国工人最听毛主席的话，我们的实际行动你不是都看到了么！”
    那位水手兴奋地说：
    “看到了，看到了。回去以后，我要向周围的人讲我看到的一切，向他们讲中国文化大革命的深远意义，对世界无产阶级革命事业的伟大贡献。”说到这里，他略停了一会儿，有点不好意思地说：“朋友，你能送给我一个毛主席像章吗？”接着，又解释说：
  “不是我要，我已经有了，是我母亲要。她在一个种植可可的庄园里做工，大庄园主无情地剥削他们。我临来中国以前，接到她给我的一封信，信上写道：‘虽然我生活在南美洲阴暗的可可林里，我却能看到东方升起的红太阳，那就是我们世界工人阶级最敬仰的导师——毛主席。在你幸福地踏上伟大的中国的土地的时候，请你千万转达我——一个南美洲老年女工对毛主席的美好祝愿，祝他万寿无疆。如果可能的话，请向中国同志要一个毛主席像章，我将终生佩戴在胸前……’”
    老杨没等他说完，立即从胸前摘下自己佩戴的毛主席像章，送给了这位水手。
    “请把这枚毛主席像章转送给你那可尊敬的母亲吧！”老杨深情地说：“这个像章是为纪念我们这个市的革命委员会成立做的，像章的背面刻有市革命委员会成立的日期。”
    “这就更加珍贵了！”那位水手从老杨手里接过像章，久久地凝视着在灯光下闪着金光的毛主席头像。然后，用洁白的手帕小心翼翼地包起来，放进贴胸的口袋里……
    天大亮了，太阳在海面上冉冉升起。轮船启航了，那位水手和他的伙伴们在船上唱着赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌：
    “大海航行靠舵手……”
    拖船上的水手们，码头上的装卸工人们，机动车的司机们，用洪亮的声音和了起来。这庄严的歌声，在海面上回荡，它乘着海风传向辽阔的天际。
