In this season of early spring and busy people, with the war drums frequently urging, the three million revolutionary peasants and cadres in the suburbs of Shanghai have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" put forward by our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, and in accordance with the instructions in the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to all poor and lower-middle peasants in rural people's communes and cadres at all levels," they have launched a magnificent and solid spring plowing production campaign. The PLA stationed in Shanghai has also made outstanding contributions to the spring plowing production in the suburbs of Shanghai.

Recently, a reporter visited the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs. Wherever he went, he saw endless spring scenery and could not walk through ten miles of brocade. It was truly a scene of ten thousand troops stirring up spring plowing, with all sectors supporting agriculture.

Only by seizing the initiative in the revolution can we better seize the initiative in production

The broad masses of revolutionary peasants in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs remember Chairman Mao's teachings on paying attention to the seasons in agriculture and not violating agricultural time, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing every moment," they have loudly declared: We will seize the agricultural time, we will seize the measures, we will seize the fertilizer, and all revolutionary forces and positive factors that are beneficial to winning this spring plowing production battle, we will all seize! In this spring plowing production, we revolutionary peasants will put the "seize" in the foremost position. As the saying goes: Seize a cart of fertilizer in spring, and reap a thousand catties of grain in autumn. If we do not seize fiercely in spring, our production will be passive this year.

From the banks of the Huangpu River to the coast of the East China Sea, from Dianshan Lake to Chongming Island, red flags are flying everywhere, and songs are ringing out. Everywhere is a scene of seizing every moment and stirring up spring plowing in a hot and lively manner.

On the first day the Party Central Committee's letter was issued, the revolutionary peasants and cadres of Fanjiagang Production Brigade in Chen Village, Malu Commune, Jiading County, gathered around a lamp to discuss the implementation of the spring plowing production plan. An old poor peasant said, "The instructions from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are so timely, we must seize the agricultural seasons and measures quickly." This brigade planted more than two hundred mu of winter wheat last year. The horizontal and vertical ditches in the wheat fields had already been dug, and the wheat seedlings were growing vigorously. According to the past, it was almost time. But after a discussion among the commune members, they felt that following the old routine was not enough. Currently, in the midst of the cultural revolution, agriculture must achieve an even greater harvest. The old almanac of the past year cannot be turned over, and the old frameworks that are not applicable must be broken. Therefore, they proposed "adding ditches to the ditches," deepening and widening the original horizontal ditches in the wheat fields to facilitate the normal growth of the winter wheat. The commune members took action the next day. The base fertilizer for cotton and corn fields was originally planned to be transported later, but the revolutionary peasants and cadres calculated that if they were to seize, they must seize the initiative completely. They arranged for male labor to dig wheat ditches while mobilizing women to carry and transport fertilizer, completing the task of transporting fertilizer to the fields earlier.

The revolutionary peasants seize every moment to stir up spring plowing. At this critical juncture, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are also trying every means to sabotage production and delay agricultural time. Facing the enemy's stirring up trouble, the revolutionary peasants in the suburbs, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, replied: In the struggle for production, we must seize every moment and be proactive step by step; in the struggle against class enemies, we must be even more confrontational and not hesitate. Only by seizing the initiative in the revolution can we better seize the initiative in production. In Yezhao Brigade, Shujian County, there was a bad element who sabotaged production by framing revolutionary cadres, trying to create chaos and delay spring plowing. The revolutionary peasants quickly exposed the enemy's tricks. They said, the enemy wants us to stop work to investigate, that won't happen! During the day, they actively carried out production according to the original plan. At night, they fully mobilized the masses to quickly investigate the problem, overthrowing and exposing this bad element. In the struggle, the commune members and cadres heightened their revolutionary vigilance and further stimulated their revolutionary and productive enthusiasm. Now, all more than two thousand mu of winter wheat in the entire brigade have been fertilized, more than four thousand mu of rapeseed have been fertilized, and more than sixty canals have been nearly completed. The revolution and production are going well.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are united as one

The earth is reviving and everything is new, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought a garden of spring to the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the cultural revolution, broken "privateness" and established "publicness," united as one, and beaten the drums for spring plowing production, determined to fire the first shot of spring plowing production.

In the fields of Dengtou Brigade, Beiqiao Commune, Shanghai County, rapeseed is thriving, and wheat seedlings are green. The crowd carrying fertilizer comes and goes; thirty-two dredging boats work day and night to dredge water grass and river mud. All more than one thousand five hundred mu of winter wheat and rapeseed in the entire brigade have been fertilized three to four times; the seedling fields have been plowed and harrowed twice; the newly expanded tractor roads can now reach each production brigade.

When night falls, the brigade office is brightly lit, and the sixth session of the non-full-time "Three Articles" training class, which has been held since the cultural revolution, begins. Fifty or sixty revolutionary cadres and commune members sit together, smiling and happy. They sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and study Chairman Mao's works. Liu Shunlong, the brigade party branch secretary from a poor peasant family, was criticized by the revolutionary peasants for some of his past mistakes in the early stages of the movement and had big-character posters posted on him. He felt that this was a great education for him, a great concern and care from Chairman Mao for cadres, further stimulating his limitless love for Chairman Mao. Since the movement, Liu Shunlong has been active and proactive in his work, firmly grasping the brigade party branch, this leadership core, and the key issue of cadres, together with the revolutionary peasants, organizing cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's works without slacking off. In the "Three Articles" training class, he encouraged the cadres, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, with the 'Three Articles' as our motto, break 'privateness' and establish 'publicness.' If there are shortcomings and mistakes, listen to Chairman Mao's words, go to the masses, and actively check with the poor and lower-middle peasants. We are all poor and lower-middle peasants, we must stand firm, the heavy responsibility of leadership entrusted to us by our class brothers, we must not drop!" The poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade study Chairman Mao's discussions on cadre issues, using class analysis methods to distinguish and treat cadres differently. The poor and lower-middle peasants believe: most of the cadres in this brigade are poor and lower-middle peasants, they are our class brothers, their mistakes and shortcomings are mainly ideological issues, we should enthusiastically help and actively support them. Chen Quanyu, the accountant of Beilin Production Brigade, was instigated by someone with ulterior motives at the beginning of the movement, and when commune members raised some opinions about him, he handed over the account book and prepared to quit. The poor and lower-middle peasants knew about this and went to do ideological work with him, studying Chairman Mao's works together. Chairman Mao said: "Because we are serving the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, as long as you are right, we will correct it." Chen Quanyu studied this passage from Chairman Mao and realized his mistake. He said, "In the past, I couldn't understand it, I didn't want to be a cadre. After studying Chairman Mao's works and being helped by the poor and lower-middle peasants, I must see it through to the end." Now, the vast majority of cadres in the entire brigade are in high spirits and full of fighting spirit, able to hold their heads high and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp the revolution and promote production.

"With united hearts, mountains can be moved." Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Dengtou Brigade are closely united, becoming a powerful main force, launching a production high tide centered on accumulating and making fertilizer.

A most active propaganda team and a most powerful fighting force

In the hot and lively rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, there is a most active propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought and a most powerful fighting force supporting spring plowing production, which is the PLA stationed in Shanghai. They have made outstanding contributions to the spring plowing in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs.

Thousands of support, ten thousand support, transmitting Mao Zedong Thought to the commune members and cadres is the greatest and most fundamental support. One day, the soldiers of the artillery company of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison Command and the commune members of the third production brigade dug rivers and built water conservancy projects together. On the construction site, soldiers and civilians competed with each other, and the scene was hot and lively. Squad leader Zhou Yonghua and the soldiers wielded their pickaxes and advanced, just about to dig to the boundary between the third and fourth small brigades, when a woman reminded him, "That side is the fourth small brigade, don't dig over there." Zhou Yonghua heard these words, and Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in his ears: "The Red Army's fighting is not just for the sake of fighting, but to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses build a revolutionary political power to fight." He thought, the army's support for spring plowing is not only about supporting labor and technology, but mainly about studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the commune members to achieve revolutionary and productive victories. During the rest time, he and the soldiers did not drink a drop of water or wipe a drop of sweat, and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the commune members, telling the story of Comrade Norman Bethune who was selfless and dedicated to others. The woman was moved by Comrade Norman Bethune's deeds and said, "Comrade Norman Bethune was selfless, but I only cared about my own brigade and did not care about other brigades, compared to Comrade Norman Bethune, I am really far behind." Many commune members discussed on the field. Some said, "To farm for the revolution, one must see the big picture and consider the overall situation, and cannot have a localist mentality." Others said, "Our narrow-mindedness is completely caused by the 'private' character." After the rest, the commune members and soldiers rushed together towards the fourth small brigade, and soon joined forces with the fourth small brigade. A long river channel was repaired, wide and deep, tightly connecting the hearts of the commune members of the third and fourth small brigades.

The seasons urge people to act quickly, every second is worth gold. The soldiers and officers of the three armies stationed in Shanghai, with the highest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, and the greatest effort, fought alongside the broad revolutionary peasants on the front line of spring plowing. Where the work is heavy, they rush there; where the work is dirty, they appear there; where there are difficulties, they resolutely go there, fully demonstrating the character of proletarian revolutionary soldiers.

The soldiers of a certain unit of the East China Sea Fleet braved the rain to transport fertilizer to the production brigades in Niuzhuang, Baoshan County, their clothes were soaked, and their bodies were covered in mud, but they still worked hard. They sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." The more they sang, the more energetic they became, and the more they worked, the happier they became.

Weng Zhengyuan, a model soldier of a certain unit of the PLA, after listening to the political instructor's speech on supporting spring plowing production, he secretly made a decision: I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and take up the hoe to support spring plowing. Although I am small and not strong, I am a member of the People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao. The PLA has never bowed down to difficulties. The regiment went to the production brigade to dig river mud and accumulate fertilizer. On the first day, he worked very hard, and his hands were blistered and painful. His comrades advised him to do some lighter work the next day, but he said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Work is struggle.... The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does.' This little difficulty is nothing." The next morning, he still worked as usual. He felt that digging soil by the river was not efficient, so he jumped into the river to dig. His pants were wet, and the cold pierced his bones, but he paid no attention. The surrounding laboring commune members praised him, saying, "The PLA soldiers work like little tigers, they are the fighting force supporting spring plowing production."

Urgent matters for the poor and lower-middle peasants are urgent for us, and what the poor and lower-middle peasants think about, we think about

In this battle of ten thousand troops stirring up spring plowing, revolutionary workers from various sectors in the suburbs put supporting spring plowing production in the first place.

In the town of Qingpu County in the suburbs, the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to all poor and lower-middle peasants in rural people's communes and cadres at all levels spread like spring breeze throughout the town, and the entire city of Qingpu County was boiling. The county established a "three-in-one" command organization for the front line of grasping the revolution and promoting production to lead the urgent spring plowing production. Revolutionary teams from various sectors rushed to the front line. The county-level organs dispatched more than one hundred cadres to twenty-two communes to lead production; the county grain bureau organized revolutionary workers to check the grain transportation and storage situation at the grassroots level; the county handicraft bureau organized revolutionary workers to conduct surveys on agricultural tools and production supplies in five major towns; the county supply and marketing cooperative organized revolutionary workers to go deep into some production brigades to investigate the demand for production materials this spring. To facilitate the commune members, they delivered goods to the countryside, strengthened and replenished the team of rural supply and marketing personnel, and the county bank organized credit personnel to go to the countryside to investigate the supply of spring plowing materials and funds.

"The proletarian revolutionary cadres must be urgent about what the poor and lower-middle peasants are urgent about and think about what the poor and lower-middle peasants think about." This is the wish of revolutionary workers from various sectors in the suburbs to support the front line of spring plowing. In Fengxian County, the land of rice, many advanced agricultural production technologies were used last year, achieving a bumper grain harvest. This year, the revolutionary peasants of Fengxian County decided to ride the east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comprehensively adopt and promote advanced agricultural production technologies, and welcome a more brilliant autumn harvest. In recent years, the revolutionary peasants of Fengxian County have used plastic film seedling raising, and tasted the sweetness. This spring, they decided to expand the area of plastic film seedling raising. However, a difficulty facing the revolutionary peasants is the lack of bamboo for scaffolding. Revolutionary workers who went to the countryside to investigate discovered this problem. What to do? It is too late to transport bamboo from Jiangxi. Revolutionary workers remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance, they went to the masses and discussed with the poor and lower-middle peasants how to solve the difficulties. Revolutionary workers and old poor peasants studied and found that cotton stalks, dry firewood, and reeds can all replace bamboo. After experiments, the effect was good and it was welcomed by the masses. Therefore, they promoted it throughout the county, solving the urgent need for bamboo for plastic film seedling raising.

The time for soaking and germinating early rice seeds is approaching, and during a meeting to discuss measures to support spring plowing, the revolutionary workers of the grain management office of Xiling Commune thought of the problem of whether the germination rate of early rice seeds in various production brigades and brigades in the commune was guaranteed based on past experience. Therefore, most of the workers of the grain management office went to various production brigades and brigades, guiding and helping commune members to conduct early rice soaking and germination experiments village by village, and found that one-third of the seeds in the entire commune had problems with germination rate. After discovering this problem, they immediately went to the county seed station to exchange good seeds. The poor and lower-middle peasants gratefully said, "You think more than we do!"

Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary tide surges, and agricultural production is hot and lively, which foreshadows that the agricultural production in the suburbs of Shanghai will have a good harvest this year. (Xinhua News Agency reporter)

    黄浦江畔春意浓　千军万马闹春耕
    ——上海郊区革命农民、革命干部活学活用毛主席著作大闹春耕生产
    在这春早人勤，战鼓频催的大好时节，上海郊区农村三百多万革命农民和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，按照《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》中的指示，掀起了轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的春耕生产新高潮。解放军驻沪陆海空三军也为上海郊区春耕生产作出了出色的贡献。
    最近，记者走访了上海郊区农村，所到之处，看不尽一片春色，走不完十里锦绣，真是一场千军万马大闹春耕，各行各业支援农业的壮丽图景。
     只有争得革命的主动权，才能更好地争得生产的主动权
    上海郊区农村广大贫下中农革命派牢记毛主席提出的要注意农业的季节，不违农时的教导，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，响亮地发出：农时我们争，措施我们争，肥料我们争，一切有利于打好春耕生产这一仗的革命力量和积极因素，我们都要争！在这场春耕生产中，我们贫下中农革命派就是要把“争”字放在首要的地位。俗话说：春争一车粪，秋得千斤粮。春季争得不狠，今年生产就要被动。
    从黄浦江畔到东海之滨，从淀山湖到崇明岛，四处红旗招展，歌声嘹亮，到处是一派争分夺秒、热气腾腾大闹春耕的战斗景象。
    党中央的信发出的第一天，嘉定县马陆公社陈村大队樊家生产队的贫下中农革命派和革命干部，就围坐在灯前，讨论春耕生产计划的落实。一位老贫农说：“毛主席和党中央的指示下达这样及时，农时季节和生产措施我们一定要争得火速。”这个队去年种了二百多亩三麦，麦田的横、竖沟早已开过，麦苗生长旺盛，照往年已经差不多了。但经社员一讨论，觉得按老常规办事不行。目前处在文化大革命高潮中，农业一定要夺得更大的丰收，往年的老黄历不能翻，不适用的老框框要打破。于是，他们提出“沟上加沟”，把原来麦田的横沟加深加宽，以便有利于三麦正常生长。社员们第二天就行动。棉花、玉米地的基肥原计划晚几天挑运，贫下中农革命派和革命干部一合计，要争，就要争一个全盘主动。他们一边安排男劳力开麦沟，一边把妇女动员起来，挑肥运肥，提早完成了运肥到田的任务。
    贫下中农革命派争分夺秒闹春耕，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右等牛鬼蛇神，在这个节骨眼上，也千方百计伺机破坏生产，延误农时。面对着阶级敌人的兴风作浪，用毛泽东思想武装起来的郊区贫下中农革命派回答说：在生产斗争中，我们要分秒必争，步步主动；在向阶级敌人作斗争中，我们更要针锋相对，决不含糊。只有争得了革命的主动权，才能更好地争得生产的主动权。松江县泗联公社叶早大队有一个坏分子破坏生产，用栽赃的办法陷害革命干部，企图制造混乱，延误春耕。贫下中农革命派及时识破了敌人的阴谋诡计。他们说，敌人企图使我们停工搞调查，办不到！白天，他们照原计划积极搞生产。晚上，他们充分发动群众，很快把问题调查清楚，把这个坏分子斗倒，斗臭。在斗争中，社员和干部提高了革命警惕性，进一步激发了他们革命和生产的积极性。现在，全大队二千多亩三麦普遍施足追肥，四千多亩油菜都施上了培棵肥，六十多条渠道已近完成，革命和生产搞得很好。
    贫下中农和革命干部拧成一股绳
    大地回春万象新，无产阶级文化大革命，给上海郊区农村带来满园春色。广大贫下中农和革命干部在文化革命中活学活用毛主席著作，破“私”立“公”，拧成了一股绳，擂起了春耕生产战鼓，决心打响春耕生产第一炮。
    上海县北桥公社灯塔大队的田野上，油菜茁壮，麦苗青葱；送肥人群来往穿梭；三十二只罱泥船夜以继日地捞水草，罱河泥。全大队一千五百多亩三麦、油菜，普遍追肥三、四次；秧田已二犁二耙；重新扩建的拖拉机路，已能通往各个生产队。
    当夜幕降临时，大队部灯火通明，文化大革命以来坚持举办的第六期不脱产的“老三篇”训练班开始上课了。五六十个革命干部和社员围坐一堂，笑逐颜开，他们唱毛主席语录歌，学毛主席著作。贫农出身的大队党支部书记陆顺龙，运动初期，贫下中农革命派对他过去的一些错误进行了批评，给他贴了大字报。他觉得这是对他极大的教育，是毛主席对干部极大的关怀和爱护，进一步激发了他对毛主席的无限热爱。运动以来，陆顺龙工作积极主动，紧紧抓住大队党支部这个领导核心，抓住干部这一关键问题，和贫下中农革命派一道，一步不松地组织干部和社员坚持学习毛主席著作。在“老三篇”训练班上，他鼓励干部说：“我们应该相信群众，我们应该相信党，以‘老三篇’为座右铭，破‘私’立‘公’。有缺点错误，听毛主席的话，到群众当中去，主动向贫下中农检查。我们都是贫下中农，要站稳脚跟，阶级兄弟交给我们的领导重担，万万不能丢！”
    大队的贫下中农学习毛主席有关干部问题的论述，用阶级分析方法，区别对待干部。贫下中农认为：这个大队的干部绝大多数是贫下中农，是自己的阶级兄弟，他们的错误和缺点，主要是思想认识问题，对他们要热忱帮助，积极支持。北林生产队会计陈全余，运动开始时中了别有用心的人的挑拨，加上社员对他提了一些意见，他就交出帐簿准备不干。贫下中农知道后，就主动去做思想工作，跟他一起学习毛主席著作，毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”陈全余学习了毛主席的这一段话，认识了错误。他说：“过去想不通，就是不愿当干部。学了毛主席著作，贫下中农一帮助，我怎么也要干到底。”现在，全大队绝大多数干部，心情舒畅，斗志昂扬，都能挺起腰杆，和贫下中农一道抓革命、促生产。
      “人心齐，泰山移”。在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，灯塔大队的贫下中农和革命干部紧紧团结在一起，成为一支强大的主力军，掀起了一个以积肥造肥为中心的备耕生产高潮。
    一支最活跃的宣传队和最有力的生力军
    在热气腾腾的上海郊区农村，有一支最活跃的毛泽东思想宣传队和支援春耕生产最有力的生力军，这就是助民春耕的人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军，他们为上海郊区农村春耕作出了出色的贡献。
    千支援，万支援，把毛泽东思想传给社员和干部是最大最根本的支援。一天，上海警备区驻沪某部机炮连指战员和驻地第三生产队社员一起挖河修水利。工地上军民你追我赶，一派热气腾腾的景象。班长周永华和战士们挥舞着铁鎝向前掘进，刚要掘到三小队和四小队的分界处时，一位妇女提醒他说：“那边是四小队的，别挖过去。”周永华听了这句话，耳边响起了毛主席的教导：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的”。他想，部队助民春耕，不光是支援劳力和技术，最主要的是和社员一起活学活用毛主席著作，夺取革命、生产双胜利。休息的时候，他和战士们不喝一口水，不擦一把汗，同社员一起学习《纪念白求恩》，讲白求恩同志毫不利己、专门利人的故事。那位妇女被白求恩同志的事迹所感动，她说：“白求恩同志毫无私心，我就只顾自己队，而不顾别的队，比起白求恩，实在差得太远了。”许多社员在地头讨论开了。有的说：“为革命种田就要识大局，顾大体，不能有本位主义思想。”有的说：“我们这种狭隘思想完全是‘私’字作怪。”休息过后，社员和战士们一起，都抢着向四小队的方向掘去，没多久，就和四小队会合了，一条长长的河道，修理得又宽又深，把三小队和四小队社员群众的心紧紧地连结了起来。
    季节催人紧，分秒胜黄金。驻沪三军指战员以最高的热情，最快的速度，最大的干劲，同广大革命农民奋战在春耕第一线。哪里活重，他们就冲向哪里，哪里活脏，他们就出现在哪里，哪里有困难，他们就坚决到哪里去，充分表现了无产阶级革命战士的本色。
    东海舰队某部指战员，冒着雨到宝山县奶牛场往生产队运肥，衣服淋湿了，身上尽是泥，还是一个劲地干。他们高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”越唱越有劲，越干越欢。
    解放军某部五好战士翁正元，听完指导员关于支援春耕生产的讲话，他暗暗地下了决心：我要听毛主席的话，拿起锄头去支援春耕。别看我个子小，力气不大，可我是毛主席他老人家亲自缔造的人民解放军中的一员，解放军从来不在困难面前低头。连队到生产队挖河泥积肥料，头一天他干得很猛，手上的水泡磨破了，阵痛钻心。同志们劝他明天拣点轻活干，他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘工作就是斗争。……越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。’这点困难算个啥。”第二天一早他还是照样地干。他感到在河边挖土不利索，就跳到河里去挖。裤子湿了，冰寒刺骨，全然不顾。周围劳动的社员纷纷称赞说：“解放军同志干活个个象小老虎，是支援春耕生产的生力军。”
    急贫下中农之所急   想贫下中农之所想
    在这场千军万马闹春耕的战斗中，郊区各行各业的革命职工，把支援春耕生产放在第一位。
    在郊区青浦县县镇里，中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信象春风吹遍了城镇，整个青浦县城沸腾了。全县成立了“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥机构，领导迫在眉睫的春耕生产。各行各业的支农队伍，纷纷走向第一线。县级机关抽调出一百多名干部，到二十二个公社领导生产；县粮食局组织革命职工，到基层检查粮食调运、保管情况；县手工业局组织革命职工，到五大集镇进行农具和生产用品的产销调查；县供销社组织革命职工，深入到一部分生产队，对今春生产资料需要量进行摸底。为了方便社员，送货下乡，他们整顿充实了农村供销员的队伍，县银行组织信贷员下乡，作春耕物资和资金供应的调查。
      “无产阶级革命派要急贫下中农之所急，想贫下中农之所想。”这是郊区各行各业的革命职工支援春耕第一线的心愿。水稻之乡的奉贤县，去年采用了许多农业生产先进技术，获得了粮食丰收。今年，奉贤县的革命农民决心乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，全面采用和推广农业生产先进技术，迎来一个更加金光灿烂的秋收。这几年，奉贤县的革命农民采用塑料薄膜育秧，尝到了甜头。今春，他们决定扩大塑料薄膜育秧面积。但是，摆在革命农民面前的一个困难，是缺少搭棚架的篱竹。县供销社下乡调查的职工，发现了这个问题。怎么办？到江西一带调运篱竹已经来不及了。革命职工牢记毛主席关于自力更生的教导，他们到群众当中去，和贫下中农商量解决困难的办法。革命职工和老贫农一研究，发现棉花秸、干戈柴、芦苇都能代替篱竹，经过试验，效果很好，很受群众欢迎。于是，他们在全县推广，解决了塑料薄膜育秧急需篱竹的困难。
    离早稻浸种催芽时间已经很近，西岭公社粮管所革命职工在一次讨论支援春耕措施的会上，根据过去的经验，他们想到公社各个生产大队和生产队的早稻种子出芽率保不保险的问题。于是，粮管所的大部分职工都下到各个生产大队和生产队，挨村指导和帮助社员做早稻浸种催芽试验，结果发现全公社有三分之一的种子出芽率有问题。发现这个问题后，他们又马上到县种子站调换好的种子。贫下中农感激地说：“你们比我们想得还周到！”
    在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗的指引下，革命浪潮汹涌澎湃，农业生产热气腾腾，这预示着上海郊区农业生产今年将有一个好收成。　（新华社记者）
