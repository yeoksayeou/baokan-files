A Dutch student recently wrote a letter to his Chinese friend, expressing his profound admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. He said, "Although I live in a city far from where Chairman Mao resides—about 12,000 kilometers away from the great capital of China, Beijing—I often miss Beijing."

He continued, "Under the guidance of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Mao Zedong, who is revered by the Chinese people and all revolutionaries, the Chinese people and all revolutionaries are not afraid of the traitorous Soviet revisionists, nor are they afraid of the American imperialists." He said, "Although they appear frightening, in reality, they are paper tigers, just like the German fascists, Japanese imperialists, and the reactionary Kuomintang."

In his letter, he emphasized that all revolutionaries must seriously study and master Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "All revolutionary people must take the Chinese Red Guards and the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat as examples, learn from their great revolutionary spirit, and love Chairman Mao as they do, and enthusiastically study Chairman Mao's works."

He concluded with a cheer, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    荷兰一位学生写信给中国朋友
    热爱毛主席　想念北京城
    据新华社伦敦电　一位荷兰学生最近写信给他的中国朋友，表达他对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。他说：“虽然我住在远离毛主席生活的城市——中国的伟大首都北京大约一万二千公里的地方，但我却常常想念北京。”
    他接着说：“中国人民和全世界的一切革命者，在中国人民和一切革命者所敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅和伟大舵手毛主席的指引下，既不怕叛徒苏联修正主义者，也不怕美帝国主义者。”他说：“看起来，他们的样子是可怕的，但是实际上，他们是纸老虎，就象德国法西斯、日本帝国主义和蒋介石反动派是纸老虎一样。”
    他在信中强调所有的革命者都应当认真学习和掌握毛泽东思想。他说：“一切革命人民必须以中国红卫兵和无产阶级革命派为榜样，必须汲取他们的伟大革命精神，象他们一样热爱毛主席，热情地学习毛主席的著作。”
    他最后欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
