In the unprecedented high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution, on the eve of International Women's Day, several foreign female experts working in Beijing spoke to our reporter, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary spirit of Chinese women, extolling the brilliance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which illuminates the path to liberation for the oppressed peoples and women of the world, and wishing the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

The female experts who spoke to the reporter, like many foreign friends in Beijing, participated with revolutionary fervor in the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, tempered in the flames of struggle, and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. In their speeches, they pointed out that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has given great encouragement, confidence, and strength to the peoples and women of the world; with the great Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the revolutionary peoples and women of the world will certainly defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, achieving thorough liberation.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength and courage

	Japanese friend Yani Bahezi spoke to the reporter, extending warm revolutionary greetings to the revolutionary women and female Red Guards of the Chinese proletariat, wishing the great alliance of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries success in their struggle to seize power through the "three-in-one combination," and wishing the proletarian cultural revolution final victory.

	She said, in the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Red Guards and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to thoroughly smash the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, to seize back the power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to establish a superstructure that corresponds to the socialist economic base. In this great historical process, every Chinese friend is actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, transforming their world outlook.

	She said, one-fourth of the world's population in China now has so many people mastering the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, which is unprecedented in the history of the international communist movement. It will certainly make an immeasurable contribution to the history of human development.

	She said, the path that Chinese women have taken shows that only by seizing the power of the proletariat can women be liberated. This tells us that only by overthrowing imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and only by achieving victory in the struggle of the peoples of the world, can the liberation of women throughout the world be achieved.

	She said, every word of Chairman Mao is a truth verified in great revolutionary practice. No matter how many times one reads it, one can always draw boundless courage and strength from it. In this cultural revolution, I have more deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is a vigorous, ever-living contemporary Marxism-Leninism of the highest level.

	Yani Bahezi said, on the occasion of International Women's Day, I once again express my determination to learn from Chinese revolutionary women, to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought together with them, to strive to transform my world outlook, and to strive to transform the objective world. Finally, I wish the great leader of the Chinese people, and also the great leader of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, good health!

	The Cultural Revolution tolls the death knell for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries

	Brazilian friend Gesuoyi said in her speech, on the occasion of the great Chinese celebration of International Women's Day, I feel boundless joy because China is carrying out a great proletarian cultural revolution led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong. This great revolution, in which one-fourth of humanity is participating, is unprecedented in human history and is the greatest event of the 20th century. In this great revolution, the masses have risen up to struggle, vowing to defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death, because Mao Zedong Thought is not only China's but also the world's most precious treasure of revolution. This great revolution will decide the future and destiny of the world revolution. It tolls the death knell for the capitalist remnants in China and also tolls the death knell for imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries in the world. This is a life-and-death struggle between socialism and communism and capitalism. The hundreds of millions of people in China, including men, women, old, and young, have all participated in this great struggle. They are advancing from victory to victory, providing the richest experience of struggle for the oppressed peoples of the world.

	She said, today, women all over the world are watching this great proletarian cultural revolution with great enthusiasm and hope. In this revolution, Chinese women have played a prominent role. On the occasion of International Women's Day, we enthusiastically hail the revolutionary spirit and heroism of Chinese women and want to learn from the new-type Chinese women of the Mao Zedong era.

	Gesuoyi said, in the proletarian cultural revolution, millions of Chinese women are at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle. They vow to defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death. Their boundless strength comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. We should take them as our example, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and stand in the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries together with the Chinese people. Today, the peoples and women of the world who are suffering from exploitation and oppression can only achieve their liberation by participating in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

	Chairman Mao's works are the master key to revolution

	The 75-year-old British friend Smith excitedly said, the greatest happiness of my life is that at the age of 75, I participated in the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in China. Living in revolutionary China, full of vigor, makes me feel rejuvenated, full of vitality, confidence, and enthusiasm.

	Smith said, the proletarian cultural revolution in China, personally led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has realized the ideals of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has a profound influence on the development of human history. China has set a brilliant example for the world to build socialism and communism. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is tempering and cultivating a new generation. The revolutionary youth of China, both male and female, have also set a brilliant example for the youth of the world.

	Smith said, from my more than fifty years of struggle, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's works are the master key to revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism of the highest level, and is a universal truth applicable everywhere. Mao Zedong Thought is not restricted by language, geography, or nationality, and has already entered the hearts of revolutionary peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is like a sharp sword, the most powerful weapon against revisionism.

	Smith told the reporter that she insists on studying Chairman Mao's works every day, carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with her, often studying, and the more she studies, the more she wants to study. She also introduced that many friends in Britain, after obtaining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," treat it like a treasure, passing it around to read. British friends wrote in their letters that due to the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, the world will have a new awakening.

	Revolutionaries must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice

	New Zealand friend Lu Si Lei said in her speech, she enthusiastically praised the Chinese revolutionary women, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, actively participating in the proletarian cultural revolution, and becoming the vanguard of the revolution. She gave an example, saying that on June 1, 1966, Chairman Mao decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in Beijing University, and among the authors of this big-character poster were revolutionary female warriors. She said, from the achievements created by Chinese revolutionary women in the cultural revolution, we can clearly see the role of Chinese revolutionary women and also see the improvement of their political status. Chairman Mao said in 1955: "True equality between men and women can only be achieved in the process of socialist transformation of the whole society." The role played by Chinese women in the proletarian cultural revolution more powerfully proves this truth pointed out by Chairman Mao.

	Lu Si Lei said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the active participation of Chinese women in this revolutionary movement have greatly encouraged women all over the world. Therefore, this year's International Women's Day marks the new great progress of Chinese working women and also marks the new progress of working women all over the world.

	Lu Si Lei, in talking about how she and other foreign experts participated in the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and how they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in practice, said, Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. The study of Chairman Mao's works must emphasize learning in struggle and using in struggle, and must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only in this way can one become a true revolutionary.

	Chairman Mao leads a revolution that shakes the world

	Malayan friend Salada said, the proletarian cultural revolution in China, personally led by Chairman Mao, is a great revolution that shakes the world. This revolution will have a profound impact on the world revolution. It provides extremely precious experience for socialist countries that have already seized power on how to prevent capitalist restoration.

	Salada, in her speech, introduced the situation of Malayan revolutionary warriors and Malayan revolutionary women arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and fighting against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionary regime. She said, despite the enemy's heavy blockade, the news of Mao Zedong Thought and China's successful development of the proletarian cultural revolution still broke through the blockade and spread to Malaya. In the enemy's prison, in the forest, Malayan liberation fighters recited Chairman Mao's quotations, using Mao Zedong Thought to inspire and guide their battles. At a mass rally, the enemy surrounded the venue, but the revolutionary masses attending the rally were fearless, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "Resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory."

	Salada expressed her firm belief that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Malayan revolutionary warriors will certainly liberate Malaya, establish a truly independent and new Malaya of the people; Malayan women will also be liberated because of this.

    在京外国女专家热烈赞颂中国无产阶级文化大革命
    毛泽东思想照亮世界人民解放的道路
    祝世界人民伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆
    新华社七日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在“三八”国际劳动妇女节的前夕，一些在北京工作的外国女专家向本社记者发表谈话，热情赞扬中国妇女的革命精神，称颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了全世界被压迫人民和妇女争取解放的道路，祝全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    向记者发表谈话的女专家同在北京的许多外国朋友一样，满怀革命激情地亲身参加了中国无产阶级文化大革命，在斗争的烈火中经受锻炼，活学活用毛主席著作。她们在谈话中指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命给了全世界人民和妇女以巨大的鼓舞、信心和力量；全世界革命人民和妇女以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，一定能够打败帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，取得彻底的解放。
      毛泽东思想是力量和勇气的源泉
    日本朋友谷内百合子在谈话中，向中国无产阶级革命派妇女、女红卫兵们致以热烈的战斗的敬礼，预祝中国无产阶级革命派大联合，实行“三结合”联合夺权的斗争取得胜利，祝无产阶级文化大革命取得最后胜利。
    她说，在毛泽东同志亲自领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵和亿万革命群众正在以毛泽东思想为武器，大破剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，夺回党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃取的大权，巩固无产阶级专政，建立与社会主义经济基础相适应的上层建筑。在这个巨大历史过程中，每个中国朋友都在活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己的世界观。
    她说，占世界人口四分之一的中国，现在有这么多群众掌握当代马克思列宁主义顶峰的毛泽东思想，是国际共产主义运动史上所没有过的，它对人类发展史必将作出不可估量的贡献。
    她说，中国妇女所走过的道路说明，只有掌握无产阶级政权，才能有妇女的解放。这就告诉我们，只有打倒帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，只有全世界人民的斗争取得胜利，才能取得全世界妇女的解放。
    她说，毛主席的话，每一句都是在伟大的革命实践中经过验证的真理。不论读过多少遍，每一次都能从中汲取无穷的勇气和力量。在这次文化大革命中，我更加深刻地体会到，毛泽东思想是生气勃勃的、具有无限生命力的当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    谷内百合子说，在迎接国际劳动妇女节的时候，我重新表示决心向中国革命妇女学习，和她们一起活学活用毛泽东思想，努力改造自己的世界观，并努力去改造客观世界。最后，敬祝中国人民的伟大领袖、也是全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席身体健康！
      文化大革命敲响了帝修反的丧钟
    巴西朋友格索依在谈话中说，在伟大的中国纪念“三八”节，我感到无限的高兴，因为中国正在进行着一场由最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东所亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命。这场由占人类四分之一的人参加的大革命，在人类历史上是空前的，是二十世纪最伟大的事件。在这场伟大的革命中，广大群众起来斗争，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想不仅是中国而且是世界革命的最宝贵的财富。这场伟大的革命将决定世界革命的前途和命运，它敲响了中国资本主义残余的丧钟，也敲响了全世界帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派的丧钟。这是一场决定社会主义、共产主义同资本主义之间谁战胜谁的生死存亡的斗争。中国千百万群众包括男人、女人、老人和小孩，都参加了这场伟大的斗争，他们从胜利走向胜利，为全世界受压迫的人民提供了最丰富的斗争经验。
    她说，今天全世界的妇女们怀着极大的热情和希望，看着这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。在这场革命中，中国妇女起了突出的作用。在纪念“三八”节的时候，我们热烈地欢呼中国妇女们的革命造反精神和英雄气概，要向毛泽东时代的新型的中国妇女学习。
    格索依说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，中国千千万万的妇女走在革命斗争的前列。她们誓死捍卫毛泽东思想。她们所拥有的无穷的力量正是来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。我们要以她们为榜样，用毛泽东思想武装自己，同中国人民一起，站在反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的最前列。今天，全世界正在遭受剥削和压迫的人民和妇女，只有在参加反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，才能获得自己的解放。
      毛主席著作是革命的万能钥匙
    已经七十五岁的英国朋友史密斯兴奋地说，我一生中最大的幸福是在我七十五岁的时候，在中国参加了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。生活在无产阶级革命朝气蓬勃的中国，使我感到恢复了青春，充满了活力、信心和热情。
    史密斯说，伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，实现了老一代的无产阶级革命者的理想。中国的无产阶级文化大革命对人类历史的发展有着深远的影响，中国为世界建成社会主义和共产主义树立了光辉榜样。中国无产阶级文化大革命正锻炼和造就一代新人，中国的男女革命青年也为世界青年树立了光辉榜样。
    史密斯说，我从自己五十多年斗争的经历中深深体会到，毛主席著作是革命的万能的钥匙，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。毛泽东思想不受语言、地理、民族的限制，已深入世界各国革命人民心中。毛泽东思想象一把利剑，是反对修正主义的最有力的武器。
    史密斯告诉记者，她每天坚持学习毛主席著作，《毛主席语录》随身携带，经常学习，越学越想学。她还介绍说，许多在英国的朋友得到《毛主席语录》以后，象得到珍宝一样，争相传阅。英国朋友在来信中说，由于毛泽东思想的传播，全世界将有一个新的觉醒。
      革命者必须活学活用毛主席著作
    新西兰朋友露丝·雷克在谈话中，热烈赞扬中国革命妇女在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命，担当了革命的闯将。她举例谈到，一九六六年六月一日，毛主席决定发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义的大字报，这张大字报的作者当中，就有革命的女战士。她说，从中国革命妇女在文化大革命中所创造的业绩中，我们清楚地看到了中国革命妇女的作用，也看到了她们的政治地位的提高。毛主席在一九五五年说过：“真正的男女平等，只有在整个社会的社会主义改造过程中才能实现。”中国妇女在无产阶级文化大革命中所起的作用，更有力地证明了毛主席指出的这一真理。
    露丝·雷克说，中国无产阶级文化大革命和中国妇女积极参加这一革命运动，对全世界妇女是一个很大的鼓舞，因此，今年的“三八”节，标志着中国劳动妇女的新的伟大进步，同时也标志着全世界劳动妇女的新的进步。
    露丝·雷克在谈到她和其他外国专家在参加中国无产阶级文化大革命中如何活学活用毛主席著作时说，毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。学习毛主席著作一定要强调在斗争中学，在斗争中用，要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，只有这样才能使自己成为真正的革命者。
      毛主席领导一场震撼世界的革命
    马来亚朋友萨拉达说，毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是一场震撼世界的伟大革命，这一场革命对世界革命将发生深远的影响，它对于已取得政权的社会主义国家如何防止资本主义复辟提供了极为宝贵的经验。
    萨拉达在谈话中介绍了马来亚革命战士和马来亚革命妇女用毛泽东思想武装自己，同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和反动政权进行斗争的情况。她说，尽管敌人重重封锁，但毛泽东思想和中国胜利开展无产阶级文化大革命的消息，仍然冲破封锁传播到了马来亚。在敌人的监狱里，在森林中，马来亚的解放战士们背诵着毛主席语录，用毛泽东思想鼓舞和指导他们的战斗。在一次群众集会时，敌人包围了会场，参加集会的革命群众毫无畏惧，一遍一遍地高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    萨拉达表示深信，在毛泽东思想的指引下，马来亚的革命战士们一定会解放马来亚，建立一个真正独立的崭新的人民的马来亚；马来亚的妇女也将因此而获得解放。
