In dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, we must follow Chairman Mao's instruction of "clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades." We must start from the desire for unity, go through criticism or struggle, and thereby achieve new unity on a new basis.

Our struggle with cadres who have made mistakes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between two lines and two kinds of thought. It is a matter of principle and stance. If we do not thoroughly expose and seriously criticize these mistakes, we will not achieve the goal of unity. As Chairman Mao teaches, "Past mistakes must be exposed, no matter who made them." Only in this way can they realize the seriousness of their mistakes. Therefore, we held exposure and criticism meetings to criticize cadres who had followed the capitalist reactionary line. With the help of the masses, many cadres began to awaken and realize their mistakes.

From recognizing mistakes to correcting them is a painful and difficult process. At this time, we must grasp the active thoughts of the cadres and help them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Toward ideological and political diseases, we must not adopt a roughshod attitude, but must adopt the attitude of 'curing the sickness to save the patient,' which is the correct and effective method." During the process of exposing and criticizing mistakes, cadres are afraid that if they speak of their own mistakes, the masses will seize upon them; they are also afraid that if they expose the mistakes of superiors or others, they will be retaliated against, and afraid of being blamed for inciting the masses to fight the masses, and so on. Therefore, we must repeatedly and deeply do ideological work with them, dispel their worries, and encourage them to join the revolution. When we study Chairman Mao's works with them, we often study together "Resolutely to carry out the task, fearing neither difficulties nor sacrifice, and to overcome all obstacles to win victory." This strengthened their courage to correct their mistakes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The attitude of the Communist Party toward backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." We always believe that the majority of cadres are good and reliable. Therefore, we should affirm the progress of cadres who have made mistakes and encourage them to continue correcting their mistakes.

In the process of helping cadres who have made mistakes, we also found that some cadres have a mentality of being "persecuted," and thus they neither confess nor expose. At this time, we organize them to participate in the self-examination meetings of others, to listen to how others put down their burdens and return to the revolutionary line. Through our patient work, they realize that the rebel factions do not want to persecute them, but sincerely welcome them to join the revolution. Therefore, they can quickly correct their attitudes and willingly accept the criticism of the masses.

    弄清思想团结同志
    东红农
    对待犯错误的干部，必须按照毛主席教导的“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的原则，从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。
    我们同在无产阶级文化大革命中犯错误的干部的斗争，是两条路线、两种思想的斗争，是原则问题、立场问题，如果不彻底揭发和严肃批判，就不能达到团结的目的。要象毛主席教导的那样：“对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面”。这样，才能使他们认识到自己错误的严重性。所以，我们召开了揭发批判会，对执行资产阶级反动路线的干部进行了群众性的批判。在大家的帮助下，许多干部开始醒悟，认识到自己所犯的错误。
    从认识错误到改正错误，这是一件痛苦的、不容易的事情。这时，要抓住干部的活思想，对他们进行帮助。毛主席教导我们：“对待思想上的毛病和政治上的毛病，决不能采用鲁莽的态度，必须采用‘治病救人’的态度，才是正确有效的方法。”干部在揭露和批判错误的过程中，一方面怕讲了自己的错误，群众抓住不放；另方面怕揭发了上级或别人的错误，会受到打击报复，怕担当挑动群众斗群众的罪责，等等。这就需要反复地、深入细致地对他们做思想工作，解除他们的顾虑，鼓励他们起来革命。在和他们一起学习毛主席著作的时候，我们经常同他们一起学习“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”增强了他们改正错误的勇气。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”我们始终坚信大多数干部是好的，是可以信赖的。因此，对犯错误干部的进步应当予以肯定，并鼓励他们继续改正错误。
    在对犯错误的干部进行帮助的过程中，我们还发现一些干部有一种挨“整”的思想，因而他们既不交代也不揭发。这时我们就组织他们参加别人的检查会，听一听别人是怎样放下包袱回到革命路线上来的。通过我们耐心地做工作，他们认识到造反团不是要整他们，而是真诚地欢迎他们起来革命。所以，他们能较快地端正态度，心悦诚服地接受群众的批评。
