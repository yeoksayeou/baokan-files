The military and civilians of North Vietnam's Vinh Linh district launched a fierce artillery bombardment on the U.S. aggressors' artillery base in the Y Luong area of Quang Tri province on the night of March 20 and the morning of March 21, achieving brilliant results. Preliminary reports indicate that over 1,000 U.S. aggressors were annihilated, 17 cannons, 57 various military vehicles, and 5 helicopters were destroyed, and a fuel depot and many military supplies were hit and set on fire.

The radio station said that the military and civilians of Vinh Linh district launched this fierce artillery bombardment to punish the U.S. aggressors for using long-range cannons stationed south of the Ben Hai River to shell North Vietnam.

The radio station said that to salvage its failure in the Vietnam War, the U.S. aggressors, while increasing the use of aircraft and warships to bomb and strafe the North, began using long-range cannons from south of the Ben Hai River to shell the demilitarized zone and many residential areas in Vinh Linh district starting from February 22 this year. After four consecutive days and nights of shelling from March 10 to 15, they continued shelling on March 18 and 19.

To severely punish the U.S. aggressors' evil war "escalation" actions, defend the North, and avenge the people of Vinh Linh district, the liberated armed forces of Quang Tri province have repeatedly launched fierce artillery bombardments and attacks on the U.S. Marine Corps artillery bases and U.S. military bases in the Y Luong and Kon Tum areas of Y Luong county, giving them the punishment they deserve.

On the afternoon of March 20, the invading U.S. aggressors once again used long-range cannons stationed in the Y Luong area to shell the areas north of the Ben Hai River. With deep hatred for the enemy, the Vietnam People's Navy and the people of Vinh Linh district, upholding the tradition of courage and tenacity in battle and the will to fight to the end, launched a fierce counterattack at 6:20 PM on the same night against the U.S. aggressors' artillery positions and the base of a Marine Corps camp in the Y Luong area.

    严惩美国强盗战争“升级”罪行
    越南北方军民猛轰南越美军炮兵基地
    消灭美军一千多名，击毁大炮十七门、军车五十七辆
    新华社河内二十五日电　据“越南之声”电台二十五日晚上广播，越南北方永灵区军民，三月二十日夜间和二十一日上午，用大炮猛烈轰击广治省犹灵县育庙地区的美国侵略军炮兵基地，取得辉煌战果。据初步消息，共消灭美国侵略军一千零七十名，击毁大炮十七门、各种军车五十七辆、直升飞机五架，同时有一座汽油库和许多军用物资被击中起火。
    电台说，永灵区军民是为了惩罚美国强盗使用设在边海河以南的远程大炮轰击越南北方的罪行，而对美国侵略军发起这次猛烈炮击的。
    电台说，美国强盗为了挽救它在侵越战争中的失败，在加强使用飞机、军舰对北方进行轰炸和扫射的同时，从今年二月二十二日起，竟使用远程大炮，从边海河以南向非军事区和永灵区的许多居民区进行炮击。三月十日到十五日期间连续四个昼夜的轰击之后，三月十八日和十九日，它又继续进行炮击。
    为了严惩美国强盗的这一罪恶的战争“升级”行动，保卫北方和为永灵区同胞报仇，广治省解放武装力量曾多次猛烈炮击和袭击犹灵县育庙和昆天地区的美国海军陆战队炮兵基地和美军驻地，给了它应得的惩罚。
    三月二十日下午，侵略成性的美国强盗又一次使用设在育庙地区的远程大炮向边海河以北地区进行轰击。越南人民军海军部队和永灵区人民怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，发扬英勇顽强的战斗传统和决战决胜的意志，于当天夜间六时二十分，对美国侵略强盗的炮兵阵地和在育庙地区的海军陆战队一个营的驻地进行了猛烈的还击。
