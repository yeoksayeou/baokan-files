The Revolutionary Mass Organizations of the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Commission Urge the Nation to Seize the Opportunity to Launch a New High Tide of Spring Soil and Water Conservation Movement

New China News Agency, March 4th: The Revolutionary Mass Organizations of the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Commission have issued an urgent appeal to revolutionary comrades nationwide on the soil and water conservation front:

Revolutionary comrades on the soil and water conservation front:

Under the personal guidance of our greatest leader Chairman Mao, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The revolutionary storm of Shanghai in January is sweeping across the nation. The situation is excellent! Excellent!

"To seize the revolution and promote production" is the great call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao. We proletarian revolutionaries must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, be pioneers in both revolution and production. We must strive for a bumper harvest this year and achieve victory in both revolution and production.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve even greater results than last year."

Spring plowing and sowing are about to begin. The central agricultural and forestry departments and the revolutionary mass organizations in the Beijing suburbs have issued an urgent suggestion to revolutionary comrades on the agricultural front to "immediately launch a new high tide of spring plowing production." We must resolutely respond to and implement this suggestion. At the same time, we must seize the favorable opportunity before spring sowing to launch a new high tide of spring soil and water conservation movement. To this end, we put forward the following urgent appeals:

1. Immediately take action, organize and strengthen the production leadership teams. Seize the opportunity, rationally arrange labor, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and vigorously carry out the construction of terraced fields, terraced lands, soil improvement, and other basic farmland construction projects. Increase the application of fertilizers, thicken the active soil layer, build Dazhai-style fields, fully implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture, and ensure increased production this year. Complete the final work of farmland maintenance and soil and water conservation projects. Actively develop small-scale water conservancy projects in mountainous areas, manage and utilize existing water conservancy facilities, combine agricultural measures, fine-till, harrow, and retain moisture, and actively prevent and combat drought. Prepare tree seedlings, tree saplings, and grass seeds, actively afforest and sow grass, vigorously implement afforestation and forest protection, protect existing forests, and strictly prevent destruction.

2. All soil and water conservation workstations, experimental stations, and institutes must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and combine with the workers and peasants. While focusing on the revolution, organize forces to conduct soil and water conservation scientific research and model work, and summarize and promote typical experiences of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

3. Some provinces (autonomous regions) have established soil and water conservation professional teams by arranging for urban youth to go to the countryside. The revolutionary comrades in these teams must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, settle down to participate in agricultural production, guard their posts, seize the revolution, promote production, and actively prepare for spring plowing. Complete more treatment tasks, increase income, and achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible.

Regarding the arrangement of professional teams and some economic issues, based on the spirit of the CPC Central Committee's "Notice on Opposing Economism," conduct investigations and research, propose rectification opinions, and solve them in the later stage of the movement.

Some issues that need to be solved by higher authorities can be reported in writing, but do not leave the team; those who have already left should return quickly.

4. Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "building the country through diligence and thrift" and "saving to make revolution." Oppose counter-revolutionary economism. Carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, save and produce, and make soil and water conservation more, faster, better, and more economical.

5. Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, take "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, break down the "self" and establish the "public," promote the thought revolution, and turn all soil and water conservation units into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our greatest leader Chairman Mao!

    国务院水土保持委员会革命群众组织向全国提出紧急倡议
    抓住有利时机，掀起春季水土保持运动新高潮
    新华社四日讯　国务院水土保持委员会革命群众组织向全国水土保持战线革命战友发出的紧急倡议水土保持战线上的无产阶级
  革命派战友们：革命的同志们：
    在我们最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自指引下，我国无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新的阶段。上海“一月革命”的风暴正在席卷全国。形势好得很！好得很！
      “抓革命，促生产”是我们伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召。我们无产阶级革命派一定要坚决遵照毛主席的指示，把革命、生产两副重担挑起来，在革命中当闯将，生产中打先锋。夺取今年农业大丰收，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    毛主席教导我们，“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”
    春耕播种即将开始。中央农林各部和北京郊区革命群众组织向农业战线上的革命同志发出了《立即掀起春耕生产新高潮的紧急建议》。我们应该坚决响应并执行这个建议。同时抓住春播前的有利时机，掀起春季水土保持运动的新高潮。为此，向你们提出以下紧急倡议：
    一、立即行动起来，组织和健全生产领导班子。抓住时机，合理安排劳力，依靠贫下中农，大力开展修梯田、梯地、改土等农田基本建设，增施肥料，加厚活土层，建设大寨田，全面实行农业“八字宪法”，保证当年增产。做好农田维修和水土保持工程的结尾工作。积极发展山区小型水利，管好用好现有水利设施，结合农业措施，精耕细作，耙耱保墒，积极防旱抗旱。准备好树苗、树子、草子，积极造林种草，大力封山育林，保护现有林木，严防破坏。
    二、各水土保持工作站和试验站、所，要坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，与工农群众相结合。在搞好革命的同时，组织力量，搞好水土保持科学研究和样板工作，并总结推广抓革命、促生产的典型经验。
    三、有些省（区）通过安置上山下乡知识青年建立了一些水土保持专业队，这些队的革命同志们，要坚决听毛主席的话，安心参加农业生产，坚守岗位，抓好革命，促好生产，积极进行备耕，更多地完成治理任务，增加收益，尽快实现自给自足。
    关于专业队的安置工作和经济方面的一些问题，根据中共中央《关于反对经济主义的通知》的精神，通过调查研究，提出整改意见，在运动后期解决。
    有些需要上级解决的问题，可用书面向上反映，不要离队；已经离队的，应该迅速回去。
    四、坚决执行毛主席关于“勤俭建国”、“要节约闹革命”的指示。反对反革命的经济主义。发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗的精神，节约搞生产，把水土保持开展得更多、更快、更好、更省。
    五、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当成座右铭来学，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，促进人的思想革命化，把所有的水土保持单位办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
        国务院水土保持委员会革命群众组织
