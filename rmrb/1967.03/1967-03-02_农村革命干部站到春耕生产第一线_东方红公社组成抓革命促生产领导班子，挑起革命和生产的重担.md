Rural revolutionary cadres have taken the lead in spring plowing and production. The Dongfanghong Commune has formed a leadership team to promote revolution and production, shouldering the burdens of both revolution and production.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Zhengzhou on March 1st: The revolutionary cadres of Dongfanghong Commune in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have taken Mao's works and production tools to the front lines of spring plowing and production, joining the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of production teams to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Currently, the commune has launched a production campaign centered around spring plowing, ridge protection, wheat field management, and sweet potato seedling cultivation. The commune members get up before dawn to fertilize and irrigate the fields. Even the elderly and children are actively preparing agricultural tools and selecting cotton seeds for spring sowing. The entire commune has applied more fertilizer to the cotton fields than last year, and the quality is better. Most of the wheat fields have been irrigated twice, and now they are applying green manure. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are full of confidence and enthusiasm, striving for an even greater harvest of grain and cotton this year.

After the "Four Cleanups" movement, most of the cadres in Dongfanghong Commune are trusted by the masses. As spring plowing is about to begin, the revolutionary cadres of the commune have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have all volunteered to go to the front lines of spring plowing and production. At this time, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in the countryside have maliciously spread rumors and shot dark arrows, saying things like, "Does going down to lead production now count as leading production or suppressing revolution?" "If cadres go to the production teams, isn't that just a repeat of past mistakes, not trusting the masses?" and so on. The revolutionary cadres of the commune have studied Mao's works and related editorials from the People's Daily, exposing the enemy's plot. Many comrades have come to realize that "grasp revolution and promote production" is Chairman Mao's great call. Spring plowing and production are matters of national economy and people's livelihood, as well as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If we do not lead spring plowing and production well, it will directly affect the national economy and people's livelihood, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some revolutionary cadres have said, "We firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, believe in the masses, and rely on the masses. If we have made mistakes in the past, it is right for the masses to criticize us! As long as we sincerely examine and correct them, stand up straight, and lead spring plowing and production well, the masses will understand." After discussion, everyone's thinking has been elevated, and their understanding has been unified. They have exposed the enemy's plot, and revolutionary enthusiasm is high. They immediately formed a leadership team to promote revolution and production, taking responsibility for different areas. During the day, they go to the production teams to lead spring plowing and production, and at night, they return to the commune to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the revolutionary cadres of Dongfanghong Commune went to the production teams, they first led the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve current problems in revolution and production. Not long ago, there was a dispute between Liu Di and Ma Di over agricultural water conservancy construction, which affected spring plowing and production. After discovering this, they went to the site for detailed investigation and research, finding that both sides had a tendency towards small-groupism. They then organized the commune members to study Mao's brilliant work "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," and led the commune members to compare their thoughts, repeatedly discussing and making everyone realize the importance of understanding the big picture and considering the overall situation. They resolved the dispute properly, pooled their strengths, and promoted agricultural water conservancy construction and spring plowing and production.

    农村革命干部站到春耕生产第一线
    东方红公社组成抓革命促生产领导班子，挑起革命和生产的重担
    新华社郑州一日电  河南省新乡县东方红公社的革命干部，坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，带着毛主席著作和生产工具，深入春耕生产第一线，和广大贫下中农、生产队的革命干部一道，挑起了革命和生产两副重担。
    目前，这个公社已经掀起了以春耕保垄、麦田管理、红薯育苗为中心的生产热潮。社员们天不亮就起床，送粪、浇地。老人和孩子也积极收拾农具，选棉花种，为春播作准备。全社棉田施肥比去年多，质量也比去年好。小麦大部分浇灌了两遍，现在正追施返青肥。广大贫下中农和革命干部信心百倍，干劲十足，力争今年获得粮棉更大丰收。
    东方红公社经过“四清”运动后，绝大部分干部是群众信得过的干部。今年春耕大忙将要开始时，这个公社的革命干部积极响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，纷纷要求到春耕生产第一线去。这时，农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却别有用心地刮阴风，放暗箭，说什么“现在下去领导生产算不算抓生产，压革命？”“干部下到生产队里去不又是包办代替，不相信群众吗？”等等。公社的革命干部通过活学活用毛主席著作和学习《人民日报》的有关社论，识破了阶级敌人的这一阴谋。很多同志认识到：“抓革命，促生产”是毛主席的伟大号召，春耕生产是关系到国计民生和无产阶级文化大革命的大事，我们如果不领导好春耕生产，就直接影响国计民生，影响无产阶级文化大革命。有的革命干部说，我们坚决听毛主席的话，相信群众，依靠群众。如果以前在工作中犯了些错误，现在群众提出批评是应该的！只要能认真检查，决心改正，挺起腰杆，把春耕生产领导好，群众是会谅解的。经过讨论，大家提高了思想，统一了认识，揭穿了阶级敌人的阴谋，革命热情十分高涨。他们立即成立了抓革命，促生产的领导班子，分片负责，白天下生产队领导春耕生产，晚上回公社参加文化大革命运动。
    东方红公社的革命干部下到生产队以后，首先带头和贫下中农一起活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，解决当前革命和生产中的问题。不久前，刘堤和马堤两个大队因为搞农田水利建设发生了纠纷，影响了春耕生产。他们发现后，便深入现场，进行细致的调查研究，发现闹纠纷的双方存在着小团体主义的倾向。于是，他们组织社员学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，并发动社员对照思想，反复进行了讨论，使大家认识到识大体，顾大局的重要性，妥善地解决了这一纠纷，群策群力，推动了农田水利建设和春耕生产的进行。
