The fundamental issue for the revolutionary faction after seizing power is to consolidate the regime and prevent a counter-revolutionary restoration by the bourgeoisie. This requires the leadership cadre to continually revolutionize and never change color.

The fundamental issue for the proletarian revolutionary faction after seizing power is to consolidate the regime and prevent a counter-revolutionary restoration by the bourgeoisie. This requires solving the problem of the revolutionization of the leadership cadre. If this problem is not solved, new bourgeois elements may still emerge in the future, and thus there is the danger of the regime falling back into the hands of the bourgeoisie.

How to solve the problem of the revolutionization of the leadership cadre? After the revolutionary faction of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory seized power, they established a new leadership organization, the "Revolutionary Production Committee," composed of several responsible persons elected by the masses. Those who best study and apply Chairman Mao's works, who are most rich in revolutionary spirit, and who best connect with the masses are elected as responsible persons. If they are unqualified, the masses can replace them at any time.

The revolutionary faction of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory also placed the leadership cadre, elected democratically by the masses, under the supervision of the masses. They did not allow them to stay in the office for long periods of time acting like officials and lords, but instead let them participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, undergo tempering, participate in labor, and ensure that they never detach from the masses and always maintain a close connection with them. This is a good method to revolutionize the leadership cadre, prevent the degeneration of cadres, and prevent the emergence of revisionism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only truly united and connected with the masses leadership cadres can be formed from the masses' struggle, not by detaching from the masses' struggle." Now, in some units where the true revolutionary faction is in power, the leadership cadres are formed from the masses' struggle. However, if these leadership cadres then stand aloof from the masses, detach from labor, and live in luxury, they will inevitably change color. Chairman Mao also says: "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state, ensuring that communists are free from bureaucratism, avoid revisionism and dogmatism, and stand unshakable. They are the reliable guarantee for the proletariat to unite with the broad masses of laborers and implement democratic dictatorship." We must always follow Chairman Mao's teachings to ensure that the regime and the leadership cadre do not change color.

    永远和群众联系在一起
    革命派夺权以后的根本问题是巩固政权，防止资产阶级的反革命复辟，这就要求领导班子不断革命，永不变色。
    无产阶级革命派夺权以后的根本问题，就是巩固政权，防止资产阶级的反革命复辟。这就要解决领导班子的革命化问题。如果这个问题不解决，今后新生的资产阶级分子还可能出现，这样，政权就有再度落到资产阶级手里的危险。
    怎样解决领导班子的革命化问题呢？北京光华木材厂的革命派夺权以后，建立了新的领导机构“革命生产委员会”，由群众选举产生的若干名负责人组成。谁活学活用毛主席著作最好，最富有革命精神，最能联系群众，大家就选谁当负责人。不称职的，群众还可以随时撤换。
    北京光华木材厂的革命派还把群众民主选出来的领导班子置于群众的监督之下，不让他们长期坐在办公室里做官当老爷，而是让他们参加到火热的阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中去，经受锻炼，参加劳动，使他们永远不脱离群众，永远紧密地和群众联系在一起。这是使领导班子革命化，防止干部蜕化变质，防止出修正主义的一个好方法。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属真正团结一致、联系群众的领导骨干，必须是从群众斗争中逐渐形成，而不是脱离群众斗争所能形成的。”现在，在一些由真正革命派掌权的单位里，那里的领导骨干是在群众斗争中形成的。但是，如果这些领导骨干从此高高在上，脱离群众，脱离劳动，养尊处优，他们就难免不渐渐改变颜色。毛主席又说：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。”我们要使政权不变色，领导班子不变色，就要永远按照毛主席的教导去做。　　　李开金
