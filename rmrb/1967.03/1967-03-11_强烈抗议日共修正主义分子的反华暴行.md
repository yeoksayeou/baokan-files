The Japanese Communist Party revisionists recently organized thugs in Tokyo to attack overseas Chinese youth and Japanese friends who support Sino-Japanese friendship, resulting in shocking bloodshed. The Chinese people are extremely indignant and strongly protest these actions. We express our sincere sympathy and high respect to the overseas Chinese youth and Japanese friends who were injured by the thugs!

The serious bloodshed incidents that occurred in Tokyo were entirely planned and organized by the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. However, the *Akahata* newspaper shamelessly distorted facts, confusing right and wrong, and described the naked fascist violence as a "democratic movement" to "defend" Japan. This is a great insult to the broad masses of Japanese Communist Party members and the Japanese people.

Just as U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, and reactionaries around the world are madly attacking our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and stirring up a violent anti-China wave, and especially following the repeated anti-China violence instigated by the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Japanese Communist Party revisionists have staged such a farce. This is certainly not a coincidence. The Japanese Communist Party revisionists orchestrated this anti-China incident entirely to serve the Soviet revisionist leadership and the reactionaries of the U.S. and Japan. By taking to the streets, they have further exposed their true colors.

People can clearly see that the "united actions" that the Japanese Communist Party revisionists keep harping about are actually openly colluding with the reactionaries of the U.S. and Japan and the Soviet revisionist leadership, acting as their anti-China henchmen!

In this serious struggle, the overseas Chinese youth in Japan have shown a spirit of fearlessness in the face of violence, daring to fight and daring to win. They have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the great thought of Mao Zedong as their weapon to fight tenaciously against the fascist thugs who persecuted them. They have set a shining example for the broad masses of overseas Chinese youth. They are truly the good sons and daughters of the Chinese people and the staunch warriors in defending Sino-Japanese friendship. They have earned the respect of the peoples of both China and Japan.

Many Japanese friends, in order to defend Sino-Japanese friendship and uphold justice, bravely stood up against the thugs' attacks, risking their lives to speak out and take action. In recent days, Marxist-Leninist thinkers and people from all walks of life in Japan have held meetings to protest and condemn the anti-China violence of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. This shows the sincere and deep friendship of Japan's Marxist-Leninists and people towards the Chinese people. They have made new contributions to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship. The Chinese people express heartfelt thanks to all Japanese comrades and friends who have fought to defend Sino-Japanese friendship!

Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese people are good friends of the Chinese people." He also said: "The peoples of China and Japan should unite." Sino-Japanese friendship is the common wish of the 800 million people of the two countries. This is an irresistible historical trend. Those who destroy Sino-Japanese friendship will meet a bad end, as history has repeatedly proven. Whoever ignores the lessons of history and persists in their actions will be swept away by the historical tide.

### 强烈抗议日共修正主义分子的反华暴行

    强烈抗议日共修正主义分子的反华暴行
    日共修正主义分子，最近在东京接连组织暴徒，殴打旅日华侨青年和维护日中友好的日本朋友，制造了骇人听闻的流血事件。中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。我们对被暴徒打伤的旅日华侨青年和日本朋友表示亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    在东京连续发生的严重流血事件，完全是日共修正主义分子有计划有组织地制造出来的。可是，《赤旗报》竟颠倒黑白，混淆是非，把赤裸裸的法西斯暴行说成是什么为了“保卫”日本的“民主运动”。这是对广大的日本共产党员和日本人民的莫大侮辱。
    正当美帝国主义、苏共修正主义领导集团和各国反动派，疯狂攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命，掀起一股狂暴的反华浪潮的时候，特别是紧接着苏修领导集团一再制造反华暴行之后，日共修正主义分子跳出来表演了这样一场丑剧，当然不是偶然的。日共修正主义分子策动这次反华事件，完全是为苏修领导集团和美、日反动派效劳的。他们这样赤膊上阵，就进一步暴露了自己的真面目。
    人们可以清楚地看到，日共修正主义分子喋喋不休地大讲特讲的“联合行动”，原来就是公然同美、日反动派和苏修领导集团勾结在一起，充当他们反华的打手！
    在这一场严重的斗争中，旅日华侨青年表现出了不畏强暴、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英勇气概。他们活学活用毛主席著作，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，同迫害他们的法西斯暴徒进行了顽强的斗争。他们为广大的华侨青年树立了一个光辉的榜样。他们不愧是中国人民的好儿女，是维护中日友好事业的坚强战士。他们受到了中日两国人民的尊敬。
    许多日本朋友为了维护日中友好和主持正义，在抗击暴徒袭击中，不顾生命的危险，仗义执言，挺身而出。这些天来，日本的马克思列宁主义者和各界人民纷纷举行集会，抗议和谴责日共修正主义分子的反华暴行。这表现了日本的马克思列宁主义者和人民对中国人民的真诚的深厚的友谊。他们为日中友好事业作出了新的贡献。中国人民对于一切为维护日中友好而斗争的日本同志们和朋友们表示衷心的感谢！
    毛主席说：“日本人民同中国人民是好朋友。”又说：“中日两国人民要联合起来”。中日友好是两国八亿人民的共同愿望。这是一个不可抗拒的历史潮流。凡是破坏中日友好的人都没有好下场，这是历史已经反复证明了的。谁要是不顾前车之鉴，一意孤行，必将被历史的潮流所淹没。
