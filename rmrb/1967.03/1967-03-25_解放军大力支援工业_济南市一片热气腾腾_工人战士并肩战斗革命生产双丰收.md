The People's Liberation Army in Jinan recently dispatched a large number of officers and soldiers to the production front lines of factories and transportation enterprises in Jinan City. Together with the revolutionary masses, they are firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production, making the entire city's industrial production sector bustling with a scene of dual victories in revolution and production.

Jinan workers, filled with the joy of victory, said: The PLA is truly the people's army personally created and led by Chairman Mao. It is our strong pillar in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and it is also our strong pillar in grasping the revolution and promoting production. The PLA is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Now this glorious example is right before our eyes. We must learn from the PLA and carry the two burdens of revolution and production even better. Many factory revolutionary masses, in order to truly learn the glorious traditions of the PLA, established and improved the "Daily Reading" (studying Chairman Mao's works) system.

The officers and soldiers who went deep into the industrial production front lines said: The factory is a classroom, and the workers are teachers. This lesson has given us new tempering and improvement. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," "The people have limitless creative power," "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." Today, in the great struggle of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," we have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis.

At the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses in Shandong are seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the broad masses of officers and soldiers went to the industrial production front lines, providing powerful support for the proletarian revolutionary masses in grasping the revolution and promoting production. The People's Liberation Army dispatched dozens of propaganda vehicles, organized many cultural propaganda teams, and set up more than a hundred Mao Zedong Thought propaganda columns, vigorously publicizing Chairman Mao's series of important instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production." They, together with the revolutionary masses, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, investigated and studied the situation of factories' power seizures and production struggles, analyzed and solved a series of problems in "grasping the revolution and promoting production." Their actions provided strong support to the revolutionary masses and dealt a heavy blow to the handful of counter-revolutionaries, quickly turning the production situation around.

Chairman Mao said: "The attitude of Communist Party members toward backward people is not one of despising them or looking down on them, but of drawing close to them, uniting with them, persuading them, and encouraging them to advance." The officers and soldiers went to the Jinan Boiler Factory and, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, studied Chairman Mao's teaching and did political and ideological work among the deceived masses. There was a worker in this factory who was always active in production but had a vague class consciousness. A handful of counter-revolutionaries incited him to stop production and go out with them to cause trouble, and he was deceived. The soldiers learned that he had a bitter background, talked to him, and did a class analysis with him. Through repeated factual analysis and reasoning, this worker quickly woke up. After the power seizure victory at Jinan Machine Tool Factory No. 2, the revolutionary masses proposed to unite by workshop and department. The stationed officers and soldiers enthusiastically supported this initiative. However, many people opposed this unity. The larger revolutionary organizations proposed to "unite with me as the main force," and the smaller revolutionary organizations were afraid of being "swallowed up." Just as everyone was discussing, the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill came. The officers and soldiers, in response to everyone's active thoughts, studied "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas within the Party" with the revolutionary masses, talked about the benefits of uniting by administrative departments, and broke down private interests to establish public interests, quickly achieving unity by administrative departments in this factory. The production situation in this factory changed greatly. The workshop that first achieved unity by administrative departments saw its production increase by more than 50% compared to before the unity.

    解放军大力支援工业　济南市一片热气腾腾
    工人战士并肩战斗革命生产双丰收
    据新华社济南二十三日电　人民解放军济南部队最近派出大批指战员深入济南市工厂、交通企业生产第一线，同无产阶级革命派一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全市工业生产部门呈现出一片革命、生产双丰收的热气腾腾的景象。
    满怀胜利喜悦的济南工人们说：解放军真不愧是毛主席亲自缔造、亲自领导的人民军队，是我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的强大支柱，又是我们抓革命、促生产的强大支柱。解放军是活学活用毛主席著作的模范，现在这个光辉榜样就在我们面前，我们一定要好好学习解放军，把革命、生产两副担子挑得更好。许多工厂的革命群众为了把解放军的光荣传统真正学到手，建立和健全了“天天读”（学习毛主席著作）的制度。
    深入到工业生产第一线的指战员们说：工厂是课堂，工人是老师，这一课使我们得到了新的锻炼和提高。毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”今天，在“抓革命，促生产”的伟大斗争中，我们对毛主席的这一光辉论述理解得更深刻了。
  在山东地区无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争的关键时刻，广大指战员来到工业生产第一线上，给无产阶级革命派抓革命、促生产带来了非常有力的支持。人民解放军出动几十辆宣传车，组织了许多文艺宣传组，创办了上百处毛泽东思想宣传栏，大力宣传毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的一系列重大指示。他们和广大革命群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，调查研究工厂夺权、掌权斗争和生产斗争的形势，分析和解决“抓革命，促生产”中的一系列问题。他们这样作，对广大革命群众是有力的支持，对一小撮反革命分子是沉重的打击，使生产很快就出现了直线上升的局面。
    毛主席说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”指战员们到济南锅炉厂，和无产阶级革命派一起学习毛主席这一教导，一起对受蒙蔽的群众进行政治思想工作。这个厂有个工人，生产一贯积极，但阶级观念模糊，一小撮反革命分子煽动他停下生产跟他们外出闹事，他受了欺骗。战士们了解到他出身很苦，找他谈心，和他一起忆苦，帮他作阶级分析。经过反复摆事实，讲道理，这个工人很快觉醒过来。济南机床二厂夺权胜利后，革命群众提出要按车间、科室大联合，驻厂的指战员热情地支持这个倡议。但是不少人反对这样联合，比较大的革命组织提出，要“以我为主”联合，比较小的革命组织怕“吃掉自己”。正当大家议论纷纷的时候，传来了贵阳棉纺厂的经验。指战员们针对大家的活思想，和革命群众一起学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，大讲按行政部门搞大联合的好处，破私立公，使这个厂很快实现了按行政部门的大联合，生产面貌大变。这个厂最早实现按行政部门联合的一车间，联合后产量比联合前提高了百分之五十以上。
