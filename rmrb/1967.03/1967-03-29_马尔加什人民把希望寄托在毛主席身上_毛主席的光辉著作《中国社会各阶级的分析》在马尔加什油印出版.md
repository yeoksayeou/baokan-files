The invincible thought of Mao Zedong has shone upon the eastern African island of Madagascar. The Malagasy people love to read Chairman Mao's works and place their hopes in Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.

According to a letter from a progressive individual in Madagascar, "In the political history of Madagascar, the thought of the great teacher and great leader Mao Zedong has never attracted the hearts of the Malagasy people as it does today."

Recently, Madagascar has published an oil-printed version of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and a Malagasy translation of Chairman Mao's quotations. Preparations are now being made for a reprint.

The progressive individual who wrote the letter excitedly said: "The working masses in Madagascar are increasingly loving Chairman Mao Zedong. After reading some of Chairman Mao's articles that we have translated into Malagasy so far, they place their hopes in Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people." He also said that all the proletarians and workers who have read these pamphlets "are happy to see the brilliant light that illuminates the truth and the path to self-salvation." Union workers, after reading the work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," understand Chairman Mao's wise judgment of "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?" This Malagasy progressive emphasized: "Mao Zedong Thought is not only beneficial to China but also to all those who seek brilliant victories. Our primary task in the future is to publish the works of Chairman Mao Zedong in the language of our motherland, Malagasy. Although we start with a few, what we have done has exceeded our expectations. A small spark can start a prairie fire."

This progressive individual pointed out in his letter that Soviet modern revisionism is harmful to the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. He said: "In Chairman Mao's speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China, he teaches us: '... In the current situation, revisionism is more harmful than dogmatism. One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to carry out a critique of revisionism.'"

He angrily denounced the running dogs of the Soviet revisionists, who are openly supported by American imperialists and their lackeys, for creating various difficulties in Madagascar. He went on to point out: The Malagasy people, who yearn for true socialism, are not discouraged by this, because the invincible thought of Mao Zedong is arming them. A united front against the revisionists and their accomplices is beginning to take shape.

    马尔加什人民把希望寄托在毛主席身上
    毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》在马尔加什油印出版
    据新华社讯　塔那那利佛消息：战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀到了非洲东部的马尔加什岛。马尔加什人民爱读毛主席的著作，他们把自己的希望寄托在毛主席和中国人民的身上。
    据马尔加什一位进步人士来信说：“在马达加斯加（按：马尔加什过去的名称）的政治史上，伟大的导师、伟大的领袖毛泽东的思想，从没有象现在这样吸引马尔加什人的心。”
    最近，在马尔加什油印出版了毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》和毛主席的语录的马尔加什文译本。现在，正在准备再次出版。
    这位来信的进步人士在谈到这件事时兴奋地说：马尔加什的“劳动群众日益热爱毛泽东主席”，“在读了我们迄今用马尔加什文译出的毛主席的一些文章后，他们把自己的希望寄托在毛泽东主席和中国人民身上。”他还说，读过这些小册子的所有无产者和工人，“都为看到了照亮真理和自救之路的光辉而高兴”。工会工作者读了《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇著作后，懂得了毛主席的“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？”的英明论断。这位马尔加什进步人士强调说：“毛泽东思想，不但对中国，而且对所有要获得辉煌胜利的人们来说，都是最有益的教导。”他又说：“我们今后的首要任务，就是用我们祖国的语文马尔加什文出版毛泽东主席的著作。尽管我们开始是少数，但我们所做的一切已超过我们的预料。星星之火，可以燎原。”这位进步人士在信中一针见血地指出了苏联现代修正主义对各国人民革命斗争事业的危害。他说：“毛主席《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》中教导我们：‘……在现在的情况下，修正主义是比教条主义更有害的东西。我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。’”
    他愤怒谴责受到美帝国主义者及其帮凶公开支持的苏联修正主义者的走狗在马达加斯加制造种种困难。他接着指出：向往着真正的社会主义的马尔加什人民并不因此而泄气，因为战无不胜的毛泽东思想正在武装着他们。一条反对修正主义者及其同谋的统一战线正在开始形成。
