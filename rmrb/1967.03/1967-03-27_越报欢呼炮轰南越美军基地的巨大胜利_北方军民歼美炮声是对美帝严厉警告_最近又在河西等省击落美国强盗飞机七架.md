Vietnamese newspapers celebrate the great victory of shelling U.S. military base in South Vietnam

The cannon fire of the northern military and civilians against the U.S. is a stern warning to the U.S. imperialists

Recently, seven U.S. aggressor planes were shot down in provinces such as Hoang Sa

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 26th - The Vietnamese newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published commentaries on the 26th, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious feat of the military and civilians of the Vinh Linh area in the north shelling the U.S. artillery base in the Yu Ling area, annihilating more than a thousand U.S. aggressors, destroying 17 cannons and 57 military vehicles.

	The commentary in "People's Daily" strongly condemns the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism recently against North Vietnam and sternly warns the U.S. aggressors: All acts of aggression will meet their deserved punishment.

	The commentary points out that on Vietnamese soil, there is no longer a place for the U.S. aggressors to hide. The flames of people's war are burning the U.S. aggressors. No matter what tactics they use, the Vietnamese people have ways to counterattack.

	The commentary says, no matter what savage war methods the U.S. aggressors use, they cannot reverse their failure. Any new "escalation" of the war cannot save them from the dead end in the south. Any new war measures cannot pull them out of the swamp of failure. Their recent military adventure plan on Guam cannot reverse the situation. Their threats of expanding the war cannot intimidate us. Their mad crimes can only make our people more hateful and more determined to annihilate them.

	The commentary in "People's Army Daily" says, the cannon fire against the U.S. by the northern military and civilians on March 20th and 21st is a stern and timely warning to Johnson's plan to further escalate the war in Vietnam on Guam.

	The commentary says, all Vietnamese military and civilians enthusiastically respond to Chairman Hu's sacred call to resist the U.S. and save the country, and are determined to continue to give the U.S. aggressors heavier blows on the battlefield.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 26th - According to reports from here: On the 24th, the military and civilians of the northern province of Ha Bac shot down one invading U.S. aggressor plane. According to additional reports, the military and civilians of Nghe An, Thai Binh provinces, and the Vinh Linh area shot down three U.S. aggressor planes on the 2nd, 6th, and 18th.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 26th - According to reports from here on the evening of the 26th, the military and civilians of the northern provinces of Hoang Sa and Binh Thuan shot down three invading U.S. aggressor planes in the afternoon of the 26th.

	According to reports, the military and civilians of the Vinh Linh area shot and damaged one U.S. warship on the morning of the 25th. (Accompanied by a picture)

    越报欢呼炮轰南越美军基地的巨大胜利
    北方军民歼美炮声是对美帝严厉警告
    最近又在河西等省击落美国强盗飞机七架
    新华社河内二十六日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》二十六日分别发表评论，热烈欢呼越南北方永灵区军民炮轰犹灵地区美军炮兵基地，消灭美国侵略军一千多名、击毁大炮十七门和军车五十七辆的辉煌战功。
    《人民报》的评论强烈谴责美帝国主义最近对越南北方犯下的滔天罪行，并且严厉警告美国侵略者：一切侵略行动必将遭到应得的惩罚。
    评论指出，在越南国土上，再也没有美国侵略者的安身之所了。人民战争的火海正在焚烧美国侵略强盗。无论它玩弄什么袭击手段，越南人民都有办法回击它。
    评论说，美国强盗的任何野蛮战争手段，都不能挽救它的失败。任何新的战争“升级”，都不能把它从在南方的死胡同中挽救出来。任何新的战争措施，都不能使它摆脱失败的泥沼。它最近在关岛策划的军事冒险计划，也扭转不了局势。它的扩大战争的叫嚣，决不能吓倒我们。它的疯狂的罪行，只能使我国人民更加仇恨它，更加决心消灭它。
    《人民军队报》的评论说，三月二十日和二十一日北方军民的歼美炮声，是对约翰逊在关岛策划进一步扩大侵越战争的严厉和及时的警告。
    评论说，全体越南军民热烈响应胡主席的抗美救国神圣号召，决心继续在战场上给予美国强盗以更沉重的打击。
    新华社河内二十六日电　据这里公布：越南北方河北省军民二十四日击落入侵的美国强盗飞机一架。另据补充报道，义安、太平两省和永灵区军民二日、六日和十八日共击落美国强盗飞机三架。
    新华社河内二十六日电　据这里二十六日晚上公布，越南北方河西、和平两省军民，二十六日下午击落入侵的美国强盗飞机三架。
    另据公布，永灵区军民二十五日上午击伤美国军舰一艘。（附图片）
    使美国侵略者丧胆的越南北方的神炮手。
