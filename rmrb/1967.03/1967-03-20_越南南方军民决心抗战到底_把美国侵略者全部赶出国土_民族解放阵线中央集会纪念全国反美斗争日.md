The people and military of South Vietnam are determined to fight to the end and drive out all American aggressors from the country. The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front held a grand meeting to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the National Day of Anti-American Resistance.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on March 18, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held a grand meeting to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the "March 19" National Day of Anti-American Resistance in Vietnam.

Many members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, representatives of mass organizations, and military and civilian personnel from the liberated areas attended the meeting.

Lê Văn Hiền, a member of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, spoke at the meeting. He reaffirmed the determination of the people of South Vietnam to fight to the end until the last American aggressor is driven out of South Vietnam.

Lê Văn Hiền strongly condemned the escalating aggression of American imperialism against the Vietnamese people and warmly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Lê Văn Hiền said that in 1966 alone, the military and civilian personnel of South Vietnam annihilated 370,000 enemy troops, including 100,800 American soldiers and 10,000 puppet soldiers. Since the beginning of this year, the military and civilian personnel of South Vietnam have achieved new and greater victories in combat.

In his speech, Lê Văn Hiền called on the people of all countries, progressive organizations, and progressive individuals to more strongly support the struggle of the people of South Vietnam against American aggression and for national salvation; to stop the bloodshed of the American aggressors and their South Vietnamese puppets; to demand that the United States stop its aggression against Vietnam, cease all bombing and other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam unconditionally, and withdraw all American and allied troops from South Vietnam; to let the Vietnamese people resolve their own internal affairs.

Lê Văn Hiền emphasized that the people of South Vietnam cherish peace, but as long as there is one American aggressor on their beloved homeland, they will never lay down their arms. The people of South Vietnam are determined to fully fulfill their sacred duty to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country. Inspired by the spirit of decisive victory on "March 19," the military and civilian personnel of South Vietnam are determined to deliver heavier blows to the American aggressors and achieve a complete victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    黎文训强烈谴责美帝国主义变本加厉地对越南人民进行侵略，并热烈赞扬越南南方人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利。黎文训说，仅在一九六六年，越南南方军民就歼灭敌军三十七万人，其中包括美军十万零八千名和帮凶军一万名。从今年年初以来，南越军民在战斗中取得了新的和更大的胜利。
    黎文训在讲话中呼吁世界各国人民、各进步组织和进步人士更有力地支持越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争；制止美国侵略者及其南越傀儡的血手；要求美国停止对越南的侵略，无条件停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，从越南南方撤出全部美军和仆从军；让越南人民自己解决他们自己的内部事务。
    黎文训最后强调指出，越南南方人民十分珍视和平，但是只要在亲爱的祖国还有一个美国侵略者的时候，他们就绝不会放下武器。越南南方人民决心最充分地履行自己的神圣职责，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。在“三·一九”的决战决胜的精神的鼓舞下，越南南方军民决心给美国侵略者以更沉重的打击，夺取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。
