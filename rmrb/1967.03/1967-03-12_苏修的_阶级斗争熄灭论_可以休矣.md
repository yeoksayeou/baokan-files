	As the red storm of the January Revolution sweeps across all of China and shakes the world, the anti-China farce directed by the Soviet revisionist leadership is becoming increasingly intense. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like have taken to the stage, leading the frenzied anti-China campaign. The Soviet revisionists have mobilized all their rumor-mongering machines: *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, *Red Star*, *Komsomolskaya Pravda*, *Trud*, *Literaturnaya Gazeta*, *Kultura i Zhizn*, *Kommunist*, and *Novoye Vremya*—a total of fourteen central publications. In January alone, they published over two hundred anti-China articles and materials, exhausting all their efforts to distort truth and confuse right and wrong.

	Why, at this critical moment when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in our country are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, have the Soviet revisionists' anti-China clamor reached such a frenzied pitch? From the perspective of class struggle, this is not at all surprising.

	Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like are kindred spirits with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our Party. They are breathing from the same nose. Now that we have exposed their accomplices in China, removed their official positions, and seized their power, and are determined to thoroughly uproot the old roots of revisionism, this has severely touched the Soviet revisionists' sore spot and dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionary forces. How could they not jump up in a frenzy?

	However, anyone who tries to counteract the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country will find it utterly impossible. Our revolutionary practice has once again irrefutably proven that class and class struggle exist in socialist society, demonstrating that even after the proletariat seizes power, it is still possible to lose it, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in our country is precisely to ensure that power remains firmly in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The great people of the Soviet Union will further open their eyes through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, seeing that today's Soviet Union not only has class and class struggle but has already taken the road of capitalist restoration.

	The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is class and class struggle, and proletarian dictatorship. Revisionism, on the other hand, seeks to eliminate this very point.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has long ago pointed out with great insight: "Revisionism is a bourgeois ideology. Revisionists blur the distinction between socialism and capitalism, and between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship. What they advocate is not the socialist line but the capitalist line."

	From Khrushchev to Brezhnev and Kosygin, they have never stopped their evil activities of restoring capitalism since they came to power. They claim that socialist Soviet Union no longer has class and class struggle, singing the tune of "the people's state" and "the people's party." Under this pretext, they promote "liberalization," "material incentives," and "the ruble as the locomotive," shamelessly advocating that "the ruble is the locomotive of progress."

	The great teacher Lenin once said: the overthrown exploiters will always try every means to restore their "paradise"; at the same time, due to the influence of the bourgeoisie and the encirclement and corruption of the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie, there will also be some degenerates and new bourgeois elements. Isn't this the reality of the Soviet Union? The industrial and mining enterprises in the Soviet Union are gradually turning into capitalist enterprises. Collective farms are gradually turning into capitalist farms. Culture and art are permeated with the rotten and decadent stench of the bourgeoisie. A new bourgeois privileged class has already formed, and the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is the agent of the bourgeoisie. Today's Soviet Union, the polarization is so stark! Isn't this the most real and sharp class struggle? This is the class contradiction that the Soviet revisionists' "theory of the extinction of class struggle" cannot cover up. Ink-written lies cannot cover up blood-written facts. They eliminate class and class struggle precisely to deceive the Soviet people, to maintain their bourgeois dictatorship, and to prevent the Soviet people from rising up to overthrow them and rebel against them.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is a fierce class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, precisely to thoroughly uproot the roots of capitalist restoration. We do not shy away from class struggle, but rather to eliminate classes more quickly and create favorable conditions for the transition to a communist society. The Soviet revisionists' denial of class and class struggle is precisely to carry out capitalist restoration under the cover of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

	The Soviet revisionists are the negative examples for the revolutionary people of the world. The capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union has given us a living lesson in class struggle. The great people of the Soviet Union will certainly, through the comparison between the glorious achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the bitter lessons of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, further understand the truth of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. We are firmly convinced that the people of the Soviet Union, who have the glorious tradition of the Great October Revolution, will rise up with mighty blows to overthrow the Soviet revisionists and seize their power. One day, the banner of Leninism will once again fly high over the Kremlin!

### 苏修的“阶级斗争熄灭论”可以休矣

    苏修的“阶级斗争熄灭论”可以休矣
    正当“一月革命”的红色风暴席卷全中国，震撼全世界的时候，苏修领导集团导演的反华丑剧越演越烈。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流赤膊上阵，领头猖狂反华。苏修还开动了所有的造谣机器：《真理报》、《消息报》、《红星报》、《共青团真理报》、《劳动报》、《文学报》、《文化报》、《共产党人》、《新时代》等十四家中央报刊，仅仅在今年一月份内就发表了二百几十篇反华文章和材料，竭尽了颠倒是非，混淆黑白之能事。
    为什么正当我国无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，苏修的反华声浪，又甚嚣尘上呢？其实，从阶级斗争的观点看问题，这是丝毫也不奇怪的。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流同我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是一丘之貉，他们是一鼻孔出气的。现在，我们把苏修在中国的伙伴揪出来示众了，罢了他们的官，夺了他们的权，要彻底挖掉修正主义的老根，这就狠狠地触动了苏修的疮疤，给帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动势力以沉重的打击，他们怎么能不急得跳起来呢？
    但是，谁想抵消我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，那是绝对办不到的。我们的革命实践，再一次无可辩驳地证明了，社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争这个马列主义的真理，说明了无产阶级掌握政权以后还可能失去政权，还存在着资本主义复辟的危险。在我国进行的无产阶级文化大革命，正是要把政权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。伟大的苏联人民将从中国的无产阶级文化大革命中进一步擦亮眼睛，看到今天的苏联，不但存在着阶级和阶级斗争，而且已经走上了资本主义复辟的道路。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的精髓就是阶级和阶级斗争，就是无产阶级专政。而修正主义正是要抹杀这一点。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就英明地指出：“修正主义是一种资产阶级思想。修正主义者抹杀社会主义和资本主义的区别，抹杀无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的区别。他们所主张的，在实际上并不是社会主义路线，而是资本主义路线。”
    从赫鲁晓夫一直到勃列日涅夫、柯西金，他们上台以后，一刻也没停止过复辟资本主义的罪恶活动。他们扬言社会主义苏联已经没有阶级和阶级斗争了，高唱“全民国家”、
  “全民党”的滥调。在这个幌子下，他们大搞“自由化”、“物质刺激”、“卢布挂帅”，竟然无耻地鼓吹“卢布就是前进的火车头”。
    伟大的导师列宁说过：被推翻的剥削者，总是千方百计地企图恢复他们被夺去的“天堂”；同时，由于资产阶级的影响和小资产阶级自发势力的包围和腐蚀作用，也会产生一些蜕化变质分子，新的资产阶级分子。苏联的现实不正是这样的吗？苏联的工矿企业，逐步蜕化为资本主义企业。集体农庄逐步蜕化为资本主义农场。文化艺术也散发出腐朽堕落的资产阶级臭味。一个新的资产阶级特权阶层已经形成，苏修统治集团就是资产阶级的代理人。今日之苏联，两极分化是何等鲜明！难道这不是最现实、最尖锐的阶级斗争吗？这是苏修竭力鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”所无法掩盖的阶级矛盾。墨写的谎言，掩盖不住血写的事实。他们之所以抹杀阶级和阶级斗争，是为了欺骗苏联人民，维护他们的资产阶级专政，不让苏联人民起来革他们的命，造他们的反。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的激烈的阶级大搏斗，正是为了彻底铲除产生资本主义复辟的根子。我们不回避阶级斗争，也正是为了更快地消灭阶级，为过渡到共产主义社会创造有利条件。苏修不承认阶级和阶级斗争，恰恰是为了在“阶级斗争熄灭论”的掩盖下，实行资本主义复辟。
    苏修是全世界革命人民的反面教员，苏联的资本主义复辟给我们上了一堂活生生的阶级斗争课。伟大的苏联人民必将从中国的无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌战果和苏联资本主义复辟的惨痛教训的对比中，进一步懂得阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的真理。我们深信，列宁亲手缔造的第一个社会主义国家的苏联人民，有着伟大的十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，一定会奋起千钧棒，起来造苏修的反，夺苏修的权。总有一天，列宁主义的旗帜将重新飘扬在克里姆林宫上空！
