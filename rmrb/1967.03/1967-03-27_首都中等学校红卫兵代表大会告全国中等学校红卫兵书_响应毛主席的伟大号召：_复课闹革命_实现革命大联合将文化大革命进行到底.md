To all middle school Red Guards and comrades across the country:

In the storm of revolution where the proletarian revolutionary faction unites to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we solemnly declare: The Capital Middle Schools Red Guards Representatives Conference has been successfully convened!

This is a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong! This is a new victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Starting from the great "January Revolution," the storm of struggle by the proletarian revolutionary faction to seize power has pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country into a new historical stage.

We, the proletarian revolutionary faction, must unite under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and on the basis of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Only then can we thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, only then can we successfully carry out the struggle by the proletarian revolutionary faction to seize power, and only then can we accomplish the historical mission of "one fight, two criticisms, three reforms" and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

"The urgent task of the masses' great unity, we should actively carry it out!" Under the great call of Chairman Mao, we Red Guards should immediately take action, break through the obstacles from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, break through the obstacles from the bourgeois reactionary line, and break through the obstacles from the old social customs. Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we should form a mighty army of the cultural revolution with the proletarian revolutionary leftists as the core, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party who are struggling desperately, and seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao teaches us: Implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. We must seriously understand and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking. We must correctly carry out the Party's class line, firmly rely on the revolutionary leftists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and thoroughly isolate and strike down the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

"All phenomena that hinder unity must be overcome." We Red Guards must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, link them with the actual struggle, and overcome the non-proletarian thoughts of individualism, cliquism, sectarianism, and personalism to varying degrees. At the same time, the revolutionary faction also has the responsibility to do painstaking and thorough political and ideological work for those comrades who are temporarily deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line. Use Mao Zedong Thought to help them awaken and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary faction!

Currently, achieving school-wide unity based on teaching classes is the best form for the middle school proletarian revolutionary faction to achieve great unity. This form of great unity is conducive to the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"; conducive to seizing the revolution and promoting teaching; conducive to rectification and promoting the revolutionization of thought; conducive to the in-depth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We Red Guards should strive for this revolutionary great unity!

We Red Guards resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call of "resuming classes and making revolution," return to school, seize the educational front that has been occupied by the bourgeoisie, end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools, and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all fronts in middle schools.

"Resuming classes and making revolution" is a sharp and complex class struggle on the educational front. It is a arduous and glorious task placed before us in the new situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing. We Red Guards must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive to complete this task!

"Resuming classes and making revolution" means resuming the classes of Mao Zedong Thought and teaching the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism. We Red Guards must respond to the call of Vice Commander Lin Biao and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. Place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of resuming classes and making revolution, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Especially, we must take the "Old Three Articles" and "New Five Articles" as compulsory courses for cultivating new people with communism, carry out a revolution in the soul to break private interests and establish public interests, strictly require ourselves with the five conditions of a successor, and cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

"Resuming classes and making revolution" means firmly grasping the direction of struggle on the educational front, seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and overthrowing them, smashing them, and exposing them!

"Resuming classes and making revolution" means firmly grasping the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminating its poison, and resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

"Resuming classes and making revolution" means firmly holding high the red banner of Chairman Mao's educational policy, reforming the old educational system, educational policy, and teaching methods, and building an educational system, educational policy, and teaching methods that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Resuming classes and making revolution" means establishing a new type of teacher-student relationship, thoroughly eliminating the opposition and estrangement between teachers and students caused by the bourgeois reactionary line, criticizing extremist democratic and anti-organizational views and other bourgeois ideas, and establishing a new revolutionary order of the proletariat.

"Resuming classes and making revolution" means returning to school, studying on one hand, and making revolution on the other. We must focus on our own school and look at the national situation. We must pay attention to the struggle between the two lines in society and the struggle, criticism, and reform in society. Now, there is a small handful of people who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, carrying out a counterattack and attempting to reverse the verdict, launching a new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary faction. They maliciously distort the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, seek to rehabilitate the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and attempt to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. They distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, and attempt to overturn the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We Red Guards should unite with revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, the great People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres and intellectuals to resolutely repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely repel the counter-revolutionary reverse current of capitalist restoration, resolutely defend the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Middle school education is an important front in our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and an important battlefield for the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the younger generation. We Red Guards must, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, smash the bourgeoisie's plot of "peaceful evolution" and build middle schools into red fortresses for cultivating strong successors of communism.

The People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally created by Chairman Mao, a highly proletarianized and combat-ready army directly led by our Vice Commander Lin Biao, who is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms. We Red Guards must strive to learn from the People's Liberation Army. Learn from their precious experience of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on the Four Firsts, and emphasizing proletarian politics; learn from their revolutionary spirit of overcoming all difficulties and fearing no sacrifice and their noble quality of wholeheartedly serving the people; learn from their Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and their fine tradition of hard work and plain living, strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, cherish public property, and be thrifty in making revolution. Build our ranks into a strong reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. We must be ready at all times. If imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries dare to defy the world and invade our great motherland, we, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, will fight side by side with the People's Liberation Army to resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate all invading enemies.

Red Guards comrades: The road of struggle is tortuous, but the future is bright. With the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, we fear neither heaven nor earth, can remove all stumbling blocks, sweep away all harmful elements, and create a new world shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

The red flag rolls over Beijing, and the song of victory echoes throughout China. We believe that under the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards movement, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will usher in a new high tide. The great Red Guards movement will appear in a new combat posture on the political stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must unite more revolutionary youth and, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, contribute all our strength to overthrowing imperialism, rooting out revisionism, building socialism, and realizing communism!

"With the remaining courage, pursue the fleeing enemy; do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu."

Red Guards comrades, let us carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion, hold our heads high, and stride forward to welcome the more violent storm of class struggle and celebrate the great victory of tomorrow!

Open our eyes to the future, advance steadfastly!

All Red Guards across the country, unite!

Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

    首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会告全国中等学校红卫兵书
    响应毛主席的伟大号召：“复课闹革命”
    实现革命大联合将文化大革命进行到底
    新华社二十六日讯  首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会告全国中等学校红卫兵书全国中等学校的红卫兵战友们，同志们：
    在无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的革命风暴中，我们庄严地宣告：首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会胜利召开了！
    这是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利！这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利！
    由伟大的“一月革命”开始的无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的风暴，把我国无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个崭新的历史阶段。
    我们无产阶级革命派必须在毛泽东思想的指导下，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的基础上联合起来，才能彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，才能胜利地进行无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，才能很好地完成一斗二批三改的历史使命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
      “刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”我们红卫兵应该在毛主席的伟大号召下，立即行动起来，冲破来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阻力，冲破来自资产阶级反动路线的阻力，冲破来自旧的社会习惯势力的阻力，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，组成以无产阶级革命左派为核心的、浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，彻底打倒正在垂死挣扎的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！
    毛主席教导我们：实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导。我们一定要认真地领会并坚决实行毛主席的这一伟大的战略思想，正确地贯彻党的阶级路线，坚决依靠革命的左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，彻底孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
      “一切妨害团结的现象，都在必须克服之列。”我们红卫兵必须努力活学活用毛主席著作，联系斗争实际，克服不同程度存在着的风头主义、山头主义、小团体主义、个人主义等非无产阶级思想。同时，革命派也有责任对那些一时受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同志，做艰苦细致的政治思想工作，用毛泽东思想帮助他们觉醒起来，使他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，和革命派并肩作战！
    当前，以教学班为基础实现全校大联合，是中学无产阶级革命派实现大联合的最好形式。这种大联合的形式有利于革命的“三结合”；有利于抓革命、促教学；有利于整风，促进思想革命化；有利于无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展。我们红卫兵应该为促进这种革命的大联合而努力！
    我们红卫兵坚决响应毛主席和党中央“复课闹革命”的伟大号召，打回学校去，夺取被资产阶级霸占的中等学校的教育阵地，结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，让毛泽东思想占领中等学校的一切阵地。
      “复课闹革命”，是教育战线上的一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，是在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的新形势下，摆在我们面前的一项艰巨而又光荣的任务。我们红卫兵一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力完成这一任务！
    “复课闹革命”，复的是毛泽东思想的课，上的是无产阶级文化大革命的课。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新的阶段。我们红卫兵一定要响应副统帅林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。把活学活用毛主席著作放在复课闹革命的首位，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来。特别要把“老三篇”“新五篇”作为培养共产主义新人的必修课，在灵魂深处开展破私立公的革命，用接班人的五项条件严格要求自己，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
      “复课闹革命”，就是要牢牢掌握教育战线上的斗争大方向，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，把他们斗垮、斗倒、斗臭！
      “复课闹革命”，就是要紧紧抓住两条路线斗争这个纲，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！
    “复课闹革命”，就是要高举毛主席教育方针的红旗，改革旧的教育制度、教育方针和教学方法，建设闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级的教育制度、教育方针和教学方法。
      “复课闹革命”，就是要建立新型的师生关系，彻底清除资产阶级反动路线所造成的师生之间的对立和隔阂，批判极端民主化、非组织观点等资产阶级思想，建立无产阶级的革命新秩序。
      “复课闹革命”，就是要回到学校，一边上课，一边搞革命。要立足本校，眼望全国。关心社会上的两条路线斗争，关心社会上的斗批改。现在有那么一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，实行反攻倒算，向无产阶级革命派发动了新的反扑。他们恶毒地歪曲革命的“三结合”方针，为党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派翻案，妄图实行反革命复辟。他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，妄图推翻无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大成果。我们红卫兵应该和革命工人、革命农民、伟大的中国人民解放军以及革命干部、革命知识分子团结一致，坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决打退资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大成果，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    中等教育是我国无产阶级文化大革命的一条重要战线，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺年青一代的一个重要战场。我们红卫兵必须在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，粉碎资产阶级“和平演变”的阴谋，把中等学校建设成为培养坚强的共产主义接班人的红色堡垒。
    人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民子弟兵，是毛主席最亲密的战友、我们的副统帅林彪同志直接领导下的一支非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的军队。我们红卫兵一定要努力向人民解放军学习。学习他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持四个第一，突出无产阶级政治的宝贵经验；学习他们排除万难，不怕牺牲的革命精神和全心全意为人民服务的高尚品质；学习他们三大纪律八项注意和艰苦朴素的优良传统，加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，爱护公共财物，节约闹革命。把我们的队伍建设成为人民解放军坚强的后备军。我们要时刻准备着，如果帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派敢冒天下之大不韪，侵犯我们伟大的祖国，我们毛主席的红卫兵就和人民解放军并肩作战，坚决、干净、全部、彻底消灭一切来犯的敌人。
    红卫兵战友们：斗争的道路是曲折的，前途是光明的，我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就天不怕，地不怕，就能搬掉一切绊脚石，扫除一切害人虫，创建一个毛泽东思想光辉灿烂的新天地！
    红旗漫卷北京城，凯歌响遍全中国。我们相信，在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，红卫兵运动在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，将出现一个新高潮。伟大的红卫兵运动将以新的战斗姿态出现在无产阶级文化大革命的政治舞台，我们一定要团结更多的革命青年，在伟大的领袖毛主席的率领下，为打倒帝国主义，铲除修正主义，建设社会主义和实现共产主义贡献我们的全部力量！
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”
    红卫兵战友们，让我们发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，昂首阔步，去迎接更加猛烈的阶级斗争的暴风雨，去欢庆伟大胜利的明天吧！
    放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进！
    全国红卫兵联合起来！
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
            首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会
              一九六七年三月二十五日于北京
