In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural people's communes across the country have, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically responded to the great call of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." Following a bumper grain harvest, they have enthusiastically delivered grain to the state. By mid-February, the nationwide grain procurement plan for the 1966-1967 grain year had been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. This is a victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought.

According to the regulations of the State Council, China's grain year begins on April 1 of the previous year and ends on March 31 of the following year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Grain, by February 20, the nationwide grain procurement plan for the 1966-1967 grain year had been completed by 104.56%.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been a great driving force for the grain front to achieve this major victory. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been even more deeply rooted in people's hearts. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary community members, and revolutionary cadres at the commune and production team levels across the country have broken down selfishness and established public spirit. With boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, they have actively delivered surplus grain to the state and delivered good grain. They said that actively delivering surplus grain and completing and exceeding the state's grain procurement plan is a contribution to consolidating the socialist system, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and supporting the socialist economic construction of the country, and it is support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many production teams, after completing the grain harvest, immediately organized grain delivery teams, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and red flags, joyfully shouting slogans and delivering grain to the warehouses. When the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party stirred up the counter-revolutionary economicism tide, attempting to sabotage the state's grain procurement work, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants stood up first to firmly repel the counter-revolutionary economicism and smashed this counter-revolutionary tide.

Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the grain departments in many places have made significant improvements in grain procurement work. They have grasped revolution and promoted production, taking effective measures to speed up the grain warehousing and transportation process. In this grain year, many party and government leadership organs and grain departments have sent workers to rural communes and production teams, changing their past single-minded business perspective and work style of not being deeply involved with the masses. They have emphasized proletarian politics, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works together with the broad masses of community members, actively propagating Chairman Mao's great instructions on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and "comprehensive planning and proper arrangement." They have, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, carried out extensive investigations and studies, gone deep into the communes and production teams, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres studied the situation and solved problems, correctly handling the relationships between the state, the collective, and the individual. Many grain procurement stations in various places have warmly received the grain-delivering masses, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to them. These practices have been welcomed by the broad masses of community members.

Because the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural people's communes and the revolutionary masses of the party and government organs and grain departments at various levels have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the situation on the grain front this year is better than in any of the past few years. The Party's policies have been deeply implemented, the relationships between the state, the collective, and the individual have been reasonably handled, the speed and quantity of grain warehousing have exceeded the levels of recent years, and the quality of the warehoused grain is also very good. What is particularly worth mentioning is that in some northern provinces with relatively poor natural conditions and frequent disasters year after year, agricultural production has made great strides, and on this basis, the grain procurement plan has also been well completed. This is of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic directive of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and reducing the north-south grain transportation.

Currently, the nationwide grain procurement work is about to be completed. It is hoped that the revolutionary masses of the party and government leadership organs and grain departments at various levels will remain humble and vigilant, continue to make efforts, and firmly implement the directive of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." They should strengthen leadership, grasp the grain procurement concluding work, do a good job in grain storage and transportation, educate the masses to pay attention to planned grain use, save grain, and properly arrange the lives of the masses, and actively support spring farming production to strive for a bumper harvest in 1967.

    伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利　无产阶级文化大革命的胜利
    全国粮食征购计划提前超额完成
    到二月二十日止全国粮食征购计划已完成了百分之一百零四点五六。自然条件较差、历年多灾的北方一些省区，去年农业生产有很大发展，粮食征购计划也完成得很好。
    新华社十日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，全国农村人民公社广大贫下中农和革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热烈响应我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在粮食生产取得丰收之后，踊跃向国家交售征购粮。到二月中旬止，一九六六到一九六七年粮食年度的全国粮食征购计划已经提前超额完成。这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    根据国务院的规定，我国的粮食年度是从头一年的四月一日开始，到第二年的三月底结束。据粮食部统计，一九六六到一九六七年粮食年度全国粮食征购计划，到二月二十日止已经完成了百分之一百零四点五六。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是粮食战线取得这一重大胜利的巨大动力。在文化大革命运动中，毛泽东思想更加深入人心，全国广大贫下中农、革命的社员群众和公社、生产队广大革命干部，大破私字，大立公字。他们怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派无比仇恨的心情，积极向国家交售余粮，交售好粮。他们说，积极交售余粮，完成和超额完成国家规定的粮食征购计划，就是为巩固社会主义制度，巩固无产阶级专政和支援国家的社会主义经济建设贡献力量，就是支持无产阶级文化大革命。很多生产队在粮食收打完毕以后，立即组织送粮队伍，高举着毛主席像、毛主席语录牌和红旗，欢天喜地，高呼口号，送粮入库。当党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派掀起反革命经济主义逆流，企图破坏国家粮食征购工作的时候，广大贫下中农首先站出来，坚决反击反革命经济主义，粉碎了这股反革命逆流。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，许多地区粮食部门的无产阶级革命派对粮食收购工作做了很大改进。他们狠抓革命，大促生产，采取有力措施，加快了粮食入库和调运进度。在这个粮食年度，许多地区的党政领导机关和粮食部门派到农村社队的工作人员，改变了过去的单纯业务观点和不深入群众的工作作风。他们突出无产阶级政治，同广大社员群众一道活学活用毛主席著作，积极宣传毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”和“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的伟大指示。他们根据毛主席的教导，大兴调查研究之风，深入社队，和贫下中农、革命干部一起研究情况，解决问题，正确处理国家、集体和个人之间的关系。许多地区的粮食收购站，热情接待送粮群众，向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策。这些做法，得到了广大社员群众的欢迎。
    由于农村人民公社的广大贫下中农以及各级党政机关和粮食部门的无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级文化大革命中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，这个年度的粮食战线形势比近几年来任何一年都好。党的方针政策贯彻得深透，国家、集体和个人三者关系解决得合理，粮食入库进度之快、数量之多超过了近几年的水平，入库粮食的质量也很好。特别可喜的是，在自然条件较差、历年多灾的北方一些省区，去年的农业生产有了很大发展，在此基础上粮食征购计划也完成得很好。这对于贯彻执行毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，减少南粮北调，具有十分重大的意义。
    目前，全国的粮食征购工作即将结束。希望各级党政领导机关和粮食部门的无产阶级革命派戒骄戒躁，继续努力，坚决贯彻我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，加强领导，抓紧征购收尾工作，做好粮食的保管、调运工作，教育群众注意计划用粮，节约粮食，切实安排好群众生活，积极支援春耕生产，为夺取一九六七年的农业丰收而努力。
