Following the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, representatives of revolutionary organizations of the proletariat in Shanxi Province, revolutionary leading cadres within the Provincial Party Committee, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army's Provincial Military Region came together to form the core of the "three-in-one combination"—the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters. They seized back the various powers usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee and firmly grasped them in their own hands, writing a glorious chapter in the history of the people of Shanxi and making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide. However, at this critical moment of "three-in-one combination," we do not fully understand the bold actions of revolutionary leading cadres. When these leading cadres proposed to unite with us, many people said, "We need to test them for a while longer." This endless suspicion is wrong. Before revolutionary leading cadres have made their stance clear and come out, it is necessary and correct for revolutionary masses to have various doubts and test them. But when they have already come out and publicly declared their stance, to continue with this attitude is to trust only oneself and not to trust or rely on revolutionary leading cadres. In fact, these revolutionary leading cadres have been tested in long periods of gunfire and shelling, and have been tested for over half a year in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, proving that they support Chairman Mao and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. What reason do we have to exclude such leading cadres from the ranks of the revolutionary masses and not unite with them? The facts prove that holding an endless suspicion toward revolutionary leading cadres is against the epistemology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Some say, "They are also in power, and must step aside," even saying that their participation in the struggle for power is "political opportunism." This view is completely wrong. "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." We must analyze the power-holders by class, strictly distinguishing between proletarian power-holders and capitalist-roaders. The standard for distinction is whether they support Chairman Mao, whether they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and whether they support and carry out the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Those who support Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and support and carry out the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao are proletarian power-holders. It is a revolutionary act for them to expose and criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and it is very good! We must resolutely support, strongly support, and actively unite with their revolutionary actions, and absolutely not let them "step aside." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the active support of the leading cadres, but only the active support of the broad masses, it will become the busy work of a few. But if there is only the active support of the broad masses, without a powerful leading cadre to properly organize the active support of the masses, then the active support of the masses will neither be sustained nor will it move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." Not analyzing the power-holders by class, and upon mentioning power-holders, generally doubting, generally negating, generally excluding, and generally overthrowing them, is a trend of anarchism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will definitely reflect their ideological consciousness. They will definitely use various methods to stubbornly express themselves on political and ideological issues. It is impossible for them not to reflect and express themselves." This is an objective law. The majority of members of the Red Rebel Liaison Station are students from colleges and universities. Most of them were born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, under the leadership of the Party, and under the influence of Mao Zedong Thought, making significant progress. However, there are also bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements in their souls. At this critical moment of "three-in-one combination," they naturally express themselves. While seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must also seize the power of bourgeois thought from our minds. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self," establish the "public," break down bourgeois thought, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we fully and unconditionally implement the Party's traditional policies on cadres.

    执行党的干部政策决不能打折扣
    山西红色造反联络站　同心干
    继上海的“一月革命”之后，山西省无产阶级革命组织的代表和省委内革命的领导干部、人民解放军省军区的部队代表结合起来，组织了大联合的核心——山西革命造反总指挥部，并把省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的种种大权夺了回来，牢牢地掌握在自己手里，为山西人民写下了光荣的史篇，也为全国无产阶级文化大革命做出了新的贡献。但是，我们在这个“三结合”的关键时刻，对革命的领导干部站出来的壮举，很不理解。当这些领导干部提出要和我们大联合时，不少人说“还得再考验一段时期”。这种无止境的怀疑态度是错误的。革命领导干部在未表明态度、未亮相以前，革命群众提出这样那样的怀疑，考验他们是必要的、正确的。当他们已经亮相，公开表明了自己的态度和立场，还再持这种态度，那就是只相信自己，不相信、不依靠革命领导干部的表现了。事实上，这些革命领导干部，过去在长期的枪林弹雨中经受过考验，如今又在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中经受了半年多的考验，证明了他们是拥护毛主席的，是坚决执行毛主席的革命路线的。这样的领导干部，我们有什么理由把他们拒于无产阶级革命派的大门之外，而不与他们结合呢？事实证明，对革命领导干部持无止境怀疑的态度，是违反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的认识论的。
    有的说：“他们也是当权派，必须靠边站”，甚至说他们参加夺权斗争“是政治投机”。这种观点也是完全错误的。“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们对于当权派必须作阶级分析，必须严格区分是无产阶级的当权派，还是走资本主义道路的当权派。区分的标准，就是看他是否拥护毛主席，是否高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是否拥护和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。凡是拥护毛主席的，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的，拥护和执行以毛主席为代表的革命路线的，就是无产阶级的当权派。他们起来揭发、批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是革命的行动，好得很！对于他们的革命行动，我们要坚决拥护，大力支持，积极联合，绝不能让他们“靠边站”。毛主席教导我们：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”对当权派不作阶级分析，一提当权派，就一概怀疑，一概否定，一概排斥，一概打倒，这是一种无政府主义的思潮。
    毛主席教导我们：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。”这是客观规律。红色造反联络站的绝大多数成员，是大、中（专）院校的学生，他们大多数是生在新社会，长在红旗下，在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的熏陶下，有了不小进步。但是他们灵魂深处也存在着资产阶级、小资产阶级的东西。在“三结合”的关键时刻，自然而然地表现了出来。在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，必须要夺自己头脑里的资产阶级思想的权，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立公字，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，只有这样，才能不折不扣地贯彻执行党的传统的干部政策。
