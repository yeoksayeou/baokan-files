A certain unit of the Guangxi Garrison's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is enthusiastically passing on the political thought work experience of the troops, raising the awareness of cadres and members, and promoting spring plowing production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 29th. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the 2nd Battalion of a certain unit of the Guangxi Garrison has made assisting the production team cadres and members in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and strengthening political thought work, as the central task of supporting spring plowing production. They have combined the current situation of class struggle in the countryside, flexibly used the experience of the troops in handling active thoughts, insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and adopted different methods for different people and different problems. They have done thought work to the hearts of cadres and members, effectively promoting the ideological revolution of cadres and members, and pushing forward spring plowing production.

Not long ago, the propaganda team traversed mountains and rivers to reach a remote Zhuang village. The cadres and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's instructions on investigation and study, ate and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and with the spirit of being willing to be students, became confidants of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They understood the family and ideological situation of the cadres and members, grasped the active thoughts of the cadres and members, and started from class education to arouse the awareness of the cadres and members. Some young people in the Dacun Production Team had the thought of fearing hardship and, under the instigation of class enemies, wanted to leave their agricultural production posts. The comrades of the propaganda team decided to conduct a comparison education between the past and the present in the entire team. They learned that the old poor peasant Yao Lanxiang had lived in a cave for several decades in the old society and had deep bitterness and hatred, so they invited her to tell the cadres and members about her family's miserable life in the old society. Yao Lanxiang spoke with tears, the more she spoke, the more sad she became, and everyone listened and shouted in indignation: "Never forget the past bitterness!" Grandma Yao also talked about her family's happy life after liberation and repeatedly reminded everyone not to forget their roots. Everyone agreed in the discussion that if they forgot the past bitterness, they would not understand the present sweetness, would forget class struggle, and would forget the revolution. The young people who were not content with their work in the countryside made a self-examination and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "grasp the revolution and promote production," to establish the idea of farming for the revolution and long-term arduous struggle, to be content with their work in the countryside, to strive to be pioneers of the revolution and models of production. At the same time, the comrades of the propaganda team also adopted the method of individual help to do in-depth and detailed thought work.

The soldiers also helped the members compile family histories and village histories, established "blood and tears accounts" and "happiness accounts," and often used these living materials to conduct class education for the members.

Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." The comrades of the propaganda team reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions, realized that the masses know each other best, have the richest experience, and the most ingenious methods, and that doing thought work also requires mobilizing the masses to do thought work to the hearts of every cadre and member. From this understanding, they fully mobilized the Red Guards, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres of each production team to divide the work and cooperate, with everyone doing thought work. The team leader of the Dawan Production Team, Tan Jiebo, had some shortcomings in his work. During the Cultural Revolution, the members posted big-character posters on him, and he used the excuse that the masses did not trust him to want to pass the responsibility of leading production to others. After the soldiers learned of this situation, they talked to him on one hand and mobilized the Red Guards and militia cadres on the other to help him study Chairman Mao's instructions on trusting the masses and the party, and used the "one divides into two" viewpoint to affirm his achievements and point out his existing problems, inspiring him to humbly accept the supervision of the masses. After the help and education of the masses, Tan Jiebo was moved to tears and excitedly said: "Chairman Mao cares for us revolutionary cadres the most, and in critical moments, he points out the direction for us. I will not disappoint Chairman Mao's care and the poor and lower-middle peasants' trust in me. I will be a good 'grasp the revolution and promote production' leader, stand up straight, lead the spring plowing production well, and be tested in the new struggle."

While helping the production team to do a good job in the active thoughts of cadres and members, the soldiers also helped the production team to cultivate a batch of cadres who do thought work, so that the Zhuang members can often receive the education of Mao Zedong Thought and continuously improve their ideological awareness. They selected a batch of activists who study Chairman Mao's works, young militiamen, and Red Guards from each production team as students and decided to help them master Mao Zedong Thought as the primary content of cultivation. The cadres and soldiers went deep into each production team and lived with them day and night, teaching by word and deed, using their own actions to inspire them to be examples to the masses. At the same time, they often introduced their experience in handling active thoughts to these cadres who do thought work, and let them practice themselves in actual work to improve their work ability. After a period of cultivation, this batch of cadres generally showed significant improvement.

Now, the learning activities of Chairman Mao's works in the production teams where the propaganda team is located have been carried out more universally and deeply. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the hearts of the cadres and members. They are in high spirits, full of vigor, and full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and are vigorously promoting spring plowing production with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm.

    广西驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队
    热情传授部队政治思想工作经验
    提高干部社员觉悟推动春耕生产
    据新华社南宁二十九日电　广西驻军某部二营毛泽东思想宣传队把帮助生产队干部、社员活学活用毛主席著作，加强政治思想工作，作为支援春耕生产的中心任务。他们结合当前农村阶级斗争形势，灵活运用部队抓活思想的经验，坚持以毛泽东思想为武器，针对不同的人，不同的问题，采取不同的方法，把思想工作做到干部、社员的心坎上，有力地促进了干部、社员的思想革命化，推动了春耕生产。
    不久前，宣传队跋山涉水，来到偏僻的壮族山村。干部战士按照毛主席关于调查研究的教导，和贫下中农同吃、同劳动，以甘当小学生的精神，做贫下中农的知心人，了解干部、社员的家庭和思想状况，抓准干部和社员的活思想，从阶级教育入手，启发干部社员的觉悟。大村生产队部分青年，因有怕苦思想，在阶级敌人的挑动下，想离开农业生产岗位。宣传队的同志针对这一情况，决定在全队进行一次今昔对比教育。他们了解到老贫农姚兰香，在旧社会住过几十年山洞，苦大仇深，就请她给干部社员们讲她家解放前的悲惨生活。姚兰香边讲边流泪，越讲越伤心，大家听了激愤地高呼：“千万不要忘记过去的苦难！”姚大娘还讲述了解放后她家的幸福日子，再三叮嘱大家不要忘本。大家在讨论中一致认识到，忘记了过去的苦，就不懂得今天的甜，就会忘记阶级斗争，就会忘记革命。原来不安心农村工作的青年，主动作了检查，表示坚决按毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示办事，树立为革命种田和长期艰苦奋斗的思想，安心在农村工作，争当革命的先锋，生产的模范。同时，宣传队的同志还采取个别帮助的办法，做深入细致的思想工作。
    指战员们还帮助社员编写家史、村史，建立“血泪帐”和“幸福帐”，并经常运用这些活材料对社员进行阶级教育。
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”宣传队的同志重温了毛主席这一教导，认识到群众相互最了解，经验最丰富，办法最高明，抓活思想也要发动群众，才能把思想工作做到每个干部、社员的心坎上。从这一认识出发，他们充分发动各生产队的红卫兵小将、民兵和革命干部，分工合作，人人做思想工作。大湾生产队队长覃继伯，以前在工作中有些缺点，在无产阶级文化大革命中，社员给他贴了大字报，他以群众不信任为借口，想把领导生产的担子推给别人。指战员们知道这种情况后，一面找他谈心，一面发动红卫兵小将和民兵骨干帮助他学习毛主席关于相信群众相信党的教导，并运用“一分为二”的观点，既肯定他的成绩，又指出他存在的问题，启发他虚心地接受群众的监督。经过群众的帮助和教育，覃继伯感动得流下了眼泪，激动地说：“毛主席对我们革命干部最爱护，最关怀，在关键时刻给我们指出了方向，我绝不辜负毛主席对我的关怀和贫下中农对我的信任，我要当好‘抓革命，促生产’的带头人，挺起腰杆，领导好春耕生产，在新的斗争中经受考验。”
    指战员们在帮助生产队抓好干部、社员活思想的同时，还帮助生产队培养一批做思想工作的骨干，让壮族社员经常接受毛泽东思想的教育，不断地提高思想觉悟。他们在各个生产队挑选一批学习毛主席著作积极分子、青年民兵和红卫兵小将作为学员，决定把帮助他们掌握毛泽东思想作为培养工作的首要内容。干部战士深入到各生产队和他们朝夕相处，口传身教，用自己的实际行动去启发他们处处做群众的表率。同时还经常向这些做思想工作的骨干，介绍抓活思想的体会，放手让他们在实际工作中去锻炼自己，提高工作能力。经过一段时间的培养，这批骨干普遍有了明显的提高。
    现在，宣传队所在的生产队，学习毛主席著作的活动更普遍更深入地开展起来了，毛泽东思想照亮了干部社员的心。他们心情舒畅，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发，正以冲天的革命干劲，大闹春耕生产。
