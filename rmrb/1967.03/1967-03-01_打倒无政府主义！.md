The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great struggle between two classes, two lines, and two worldviews. In this unprecedentedly intense class struggle, various ideologies keep surging towards us. We have just repulsed the counter-revolutionary economism, and now anarchism, dressed in an unfamiliar guise, has taken the stage.

When we proletarian revolutionaries respond to Chairman Mao's great call to implement the "three-in-one combination" and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, anarchism pops up and says: "Power-holders, step aside, you can't be used!" They slander those who insist on the correct policy of the "three-in-one combination" as "new royalists," "right-opportunists," and so on.

When the proletarian revolutionaries establish temporary power organs according to the principle of the "three-in-one combination" and exercise the revolutionary authority of the proletariat, anarchism jumps out and says: "Who do you think you are? You want to lead me? No way!" When the proletarian revolutionaries arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen organizational discipline, and lead the troops to fight against the class enemies, anarchism bounces out and shouts: "You're mobilizing the masses, treating the masses as pawns, this is outrageous!"

Anarchism opposes all leadership, opposes all authority, denies everything, and overthrows everything. This is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. They want only democracy, not concentration; only freedom, not discipline. They oppose the masses and leadership. They use the highest directives and the Party's policies for their own purposes, "taking what they need," instead of executing them strictly. This is an extremely dangerous tendency.

We cannot help but ask: Does the proletariat and its allies not need to establish proletarian revolutionary authority? Does it not need to establish a strict proletarian revolutionary discipline? Does it not need a high degree of concentration and unified will? Does it not need to issue administrative orders with coercive power?

Let us listen to what the revolutionary leaders have to say:

Engels, in summarizing the experience and lessons of the Paris Commune, emphasized the necessity and importance of exercising proletarian revolutionary authority. He wrote: "If the Commune had not relied on the authority of the armed people to oppose the bourgeoisie, could it have lasted more than a day? On the other hand, are we not justified in blaming the Commune for not using this authority enough?"

Lenin, in "Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, wrote: "The unconditional centralism and strictest discipline of the proletariat are one of the basic conditions for the victory over the bourgeoisie." Lenin also pointed out sharply: "Whoever weakens the iron discipline of the proletarian party, even slightly (especially in the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat), is actually helping the bourgeoisie against the proletariat." When we compare the views of the anarchists with the words of Engels and Lenin, the reactionary nature of anarchism becomes clear.

In the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, anarchism has always done a great favor to the bourgeoisie. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is no exception. When the proletarian revolutionaries enter the stage of the "three-in-one combination" joint struggle for power, the reactionary nature of anarchism becomes more apparent. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places..." Therefore, we must today give a fierce rebuff to anarchism.

It is worth noting that some people with ulterior motives, in order to peddle anarchist goods, vigorously wave the banner of "mass line" and "great democracy" to deceive and confuse people. Anarchism and proletarian great democracy are two completely different concepts. Proletarian great democracy is based on the dictatorship of the proletariat and is for the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat; while anarchism fundamentally denies the necessity of the existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat, completely going in the opposite direction, and is completely contrary to the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. Proletarian great democracy, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, guarantees the full democratic rights of the people and mobilizes hundreds of millions of people to fiercely strike at the enemies of socialism; while anarchism denies all authority and leadership, "opens up the world" for individuals, opposes everything, excludes everything, and overthrows everything. Proletarian great democracy is under the guidance of high concentration and discipline; while anarchism demands extreme freedom and democracy. This is enough to show that proletarian great democracy and anarchism have nothing in common. Those with ulterior motives, using the name of proletarian great democracy to practice anarchism, are only slapping themselves in the face.

The soul of anarchism is extremely ugly. Lenin said: "Anarchism is bourgeois individualism in disguise. Individualism is the basis of the entire worldview of anarchism." To fundamentally bury anarchism, we must honestly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, learn class analysis, and launch a total attack on the "self" that lurks in our minds, thoroughly eliminate the bad traits of the petty bourgeoisie, and overcome individualism.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, we should open fire on the reactionary anarchist ideology. We should defeat it, and we will definitely defeat it!

    打倒无政府主义！
    红勇兵　卫东彪
    无产阶级文化大革命是两个阶级、两条道路、两种世界观的大决战。在这场空前激烈的阶级斗争中，各种思潮不断朝着人们冲来。我们刚刚击退反革命经济主义，无政府主义又披上前所未见的外衣登台表演了。
    当着我们无产阶级革命派响应毛主席的伟大号召，进行“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的时候，无政府主义就跑出来说：
  “当权派，靠边站，用不得！”并把坚持实行“三结合”正确方针的真正的无产阶级革命派诬为“新保皇派”、“右倾机会主义”，等等。
    当着无产阶级革命派按照“三结合”原则建立起临时权力机构，行使无产阶级的革命权威的时候，无政府主义又跳出来说：“你算老几，要来领导我，办不到！”当着无产阶级革命派用毛泽东思想来武装自己，加强组织纪律性，并率队向阶级敌人进行战斗的时候，无政府主义又蹦出来嚷：“你们运动群众，把群众当成阿斗，真是岂有此理！”
    无政府主义反对一切领导，反对一切权威，否定一切，打倒一切，这是反马列主义、反毛泽东思想的。他们只要民主，不要集中；只要自由，不要纪律。他们把群众与领导对立起来。他们对最高指示和党的方针政策也是为我所用，“各取所需”，而不是不折不扣的执行。这是一种极端危险的倾向。
    我们不禁要问：无产阶级及其同盟者，难道不需要树立无产阶级的革命权威？难道不需要建立极严格的无产阶级革命纪律？难道不需要高度的集中和统一的意志？难道不需要颁布带强制性的行政命令吗？
    让我们来听听革命导师是怎样说的吧：
    恩格斯在总结巴黎公社的经验教训时，非常强调了行使无产阶级革命权威的必要性和重要性。他写道：“要是巴黎公社不曾凭借武装人民的权威来反对资产阶级，那它能支持到一天以上么？反过来说，我们不是有理由因为公社把这个权威运用得太少而加以责备么？”
    列宁在《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》一书中写道：“无产阶级的无条件的集中制和极严格的纪律，是战胜资产阶级的基本条件之一。”列宁并且一针见血地指出：“谁要是把无产阶级政党的铁的纪律哪怕是稍微削弱一点（特别是在无产阶级专政时期），那他事实上就是帮助资产阶级来反对无产阶级。”把无政府主义者的观点同恩格斯和列宁的言论一对照，无政府主义的反动性就一目了然了。
    在无产阶级和资产阶级的你死我活的搏斗中，无政府主义从来都是帮了资产阶级的大忙的。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，也毫不例外。当无产阶级革命派进入“三结合”联合夺权斗争的阶段时，无政府主义的反动性就愈明显了。我们最伟大的领袖毛主席早就指出：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，……”因此，我们今天对于无政府主义必须给予狠狠的回击。
    值得注意的是，一些居心叵测的家伙，为了贩卖无政府主义私货，极力打出“群众路线”“大民主”的旗号来招摇撞骗，混淆视听。无政府主义与无产阶级大民主是两个截然不同的概念。无产阶级大民主是以无产阶级专政为前提，是为了巩固无产阶级专政的；而无政府主义却从根本上否认无产阶级专政存在之必要，完全反其道而行之，是完全背离了无产阶级及广大劳动人民的根本利益的。无产阶级大民主是在毛泽东思想指引下，保障人民群众的充分民主权利，发动亿万群众狠狠打击社会主义的敌人；而无政府主义否认一切权威与领导，为个人“开天辟地”，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切。无产阶级大民主是在高度的集中和纪律指导下的；而无政府主义则要求极端的自由，民主。这就足以说明无产阶级大民主和无政府主义毫无共同之处。那些别有用心的人，借无产阶级大民主之名，行无政府主义之实，只是自己打自己的耳光而已。
    无政府主义的灵魂丑极了。列宁说过：“无政府主义是改头换面的资产阶级个人主义。个人主义是无政府主义整个世界观的基础。”我们要从根本上埋葬无政府主义，就必须老老实实地用毛泽东思想来武装我们每个人的头脑，学会阶级分析，同时向盘踞在头脑中的“私”字发动总攻击，彻底消除小资产阶级的劣根性，克服个人主义。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，我们应当向反动的无政府主义思潮开火。我们应该战胜它，我们也一定能够战胜它！
