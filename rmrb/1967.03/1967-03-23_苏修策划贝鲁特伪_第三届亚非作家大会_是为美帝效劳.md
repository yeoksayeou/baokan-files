The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Issues a Statement Exposing the Soviet Revisionists' Serious Crimes of Splitting and Sabotaging the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement

The Soviet Revisionists' Plot of the Bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Beirut is to Serve the U.S. Imperialists

From a large amount of facts, it is once again concluded that the Soviet Revisionists are the number one running dog of the U.S. imperialists and the number one traitor to the Afro-Asian peoples; to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism.

The preparations for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year are proceeding satisfactorily, and the victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a guarantee for the success of the conference.

New China News Agency, March 22nd: The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau issued an important statement on March 21st, emphasizing that there has always been a fierce struggle between two lines within the Afro-Asian writers' movement. It condemns the illegal and splitist bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" planned by the Soviet Revisionists in Beirut as serving the U.S. imperialists, and exposes the Soviet Revisionists' serious crimes of splitting and sabotaging the Afro-Asian writers' movement. The statement points out: "The Soviet modern revisionists are the number one running dog of the U.S. imperialists and the number one traitor to the Afro-Asian peoples; to oppose imperialism led by the United States, one must oppose modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership."

The statement is as follows:

In the past few weeks, many Afro-Asian writers' organizations and national liberation organizations have responded to the call of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, issuing statements condemning the Soviet Revisionists' plot to hold the bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Beirut at the end of this month. Recently, two delegations from the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, during their successful visits to twelve Afro-Asian countries, also issued a series of joint statements and declarations, exposing and condemning the Soviet Revisionist leadership's conspiracy to hold the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut.

The Permanent Bureau pays tribute to all those revolutionary Afro-Asian writers' organizations and national liberation organizations that have shown combat unity in exposing, denouncing, and condemning the Soviet Revisionists' recent conspiracy against the Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and the fighting writers' organizations of the two continents have greatly strengthened our united anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, thoroughly exposing the Soviet modern revisionists as the number one running dog of the U.S. imperialists.

It should be pointed out that in the more than eight years since the First Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in 1958, there has been a fierce struggle between two lines within the Afro-Asian writers' movement. One line is the revolutionary line firmly held by the vast majority of progressive and revolutionary Afro-Asian writers, which resolutely opposes imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States, and firmly supports the national liberation struggles of the Afro-Asian peoples. This line has greatly promoted the cause of Afro-Asian peoples' unity against imperialism. The other line is the line of capitulation and splitism advocated by the Soviet Revisionist leadership, which colludes with and betrays the U.S. imperialists, sabotages and splits the Afro-Asian writers' movement, and sells out the revolutionary cause of the Afro-Asian peoples. This line has suffered a shameful failure under the strong opposition of the vast majority of Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

It should be pointed out that in the past nine years, the Soviet Revisionists, in order to peddle their line of capitulation to U.S. imperialism, have often resorted to two tactics: one is to use the pretext of discussing literature to sabotage the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the Afro-Asian peoples. However, this pretext has been exposed by the Afro-Asian peoples, who have come to realize in their struggles that literature and politics cannot be separated. For example, when the Vietnamese and Palestinian peoples are suffering from the aggression of the imperialists led by the United States, how can the Afro-Asian peoples and writers merely talk about literature without giving them actual support in their sacred anti-imperialist struggle for national salvation? The Soviet Revisionists' other tactic is to play tricks of false anti-imperialism, false support, and false unity. Indeed, they sometimes pretend to shout a few words of support for the liberation struggles of the Vietnamese and Palestinian peoples, but who does not know that the Soviet Revisionists are colluding with the U.S. to peddle the "peace talks" conspiracy, betraying the sacred cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation? Who does not know that the Soviet Revisionists are colluding with Israel to betray the interests of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples? In the past year and a half, the Soviet Revisionists, in order to further implement their line of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," have increasingly exposed themselves. Now they have openly betrayed the U.S. imperialists, more frantically and openly split the united movement of the Afro-Asian peoples, and betrayed the interests of the Afro-Asian peoples. The current Soviet Revisionists' plot of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut has brought their sabotage activities against the Afro-Asian writers' movement to a peak.

Due to the revolutionary line held by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau headed by Sannanayaka, the Soviet Revisionists have been frustrated in their conspiracies one after another. Recently, Chugunov, the secretary of the Soviet Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, and Azimov, the chairman of the Soviet Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, personally launched a shameless slander against the Permanent Bureau and its secretary-general Sannanayaka, accusing Sannanayaka of "distorting the facts" in exposing the Soviet Revisionists' conspiracy to hold the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut and in condemning the Soviet Revisionists for betraying the Afro-Asian writers and peoples to serve the imperialists led by the United States. This clearly shows that they have been hit where it hurts.

Yes, we have repeatedly declared that the organizers of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut have betrayed the Afro-Asian peoples and served the imperialists led by the United States. We say this because we have irrefutable and clear facts.

Let us look at the facts of just the past year!

Didn't the Soviet Writers' Union's revisionist leadership do everything in their power to sabotage the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference held in Beijing in June 1966 to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression? Isn't this a fact?

Didn't the Soviet Writers' Union's revisionist leadership, in a telegram to the secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Sannanayaka, on the eve of the emergency conference, question whether it was necessary to hold the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression? Isn't this a fact?

When the preparations for the emergency conference were underway, didn't the same Soviet Writers' Union's revisionist leadership hold a splitist meeting in Cairo and launch a frenzied slander and attack against the Permanent Bureau and its secretary-general? Isn't this a fact?

Didn't the same revisionist leadership plot the splitist meeting in Baku, giving false support and true betrayal to the struggle of the Vietnamese people? Isn't this a fact?

Didn't the same revisionist leadership plot the splitist meeting in Cairo to prepare for the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut? Isn't this a fact?

Didn't the same splitist "preparatory committee" decide to beg for donations from UNESCO for the so-called "Afro-Asian Writers' Association" and the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut? Isn't this a fact?

Isn't it a fact that the U.S. imperialists are the main financial backers of UNESCO?

Isn't it a fact that UNESCO is a tool for the imperialists led by the United States to carry out cultural aggression in Afro-Asian countries and even the whole world?

Isn't it a fact that the same revisionist leadership is trying to carry out cultural transactions with the U.S. through the assistance of UNESCO, sabotaging the revolutionary struggle of the Afro-Asian writers and peoples against imperialist cultural aggression?

Didn't the notorious poet Yevtushenko of the Soviet Writers' Union, during his recent visit to the United States, lay a wreath for the deceased imperialist leader Kennedy, expressing his admiration, thus shamelessly exposing the traitorous face of the Soviet writers' surrender to U.S. imperialism before the whole world? Isn't this a fact?

Weren't there any documents in the files of the bogus "Third Conference" preparatory committee meeting held in Cairo last November by the Soviet Revisionists supporting the Vietnamese people's sacred struggle against U.S. aggression? Weren't there any documents exposing and condemning the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. in the war of aggression against Vietnam? Isn't this a fact?

Didn't the Soviet Revisionist organizers of the bogus conference in Beirut deliberately and vaguely mention the importance of the struggle of the Afro-Asian writers and peoples against the imperialists led by the United States in all the documents related to the conference? Isn't this a fact?

Didn't the Soviet Revisionist organizers of the bogus conference in Beirut deliberately avoid the issue of the liberation of Palestine to satisfy the interests of the imperialists they are collaborating with? Isn't this a fact?

The above facts once again prove that the Soviet Revisionist organizers of the illegal and splitist bogus conference in Beirut are indeed serving the imperialists led by the United States.

We once again reach the conclusion: The Soviet modern revisionists are the number one running dog of the U.S. imperialists and the number one traitor to the Afro-Asian peoples; to oppose the imperialists led by the United States, one must oppose the modern revisionists led by the Soviet leadership.

We are deeply convinced that history will once again prove the universal truth pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the cause of the people. They will not deviate from this logic." The Soviet Revisionists, after a series of failures in their splitist conferences, will inevitably suffer an even more miserable failure in their plot of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut, which will accelerate the demise of the Soviet Revisionists. The result of the bogus "Third Conference" will therefore only be "lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet": all progressive Afro-Asian writers, including those who have been temporarily deceived, will be able to see more clearly the ugly face of the Soviet Revisionists' complete betrayal to the U.S. imperialists and betrayal of the interests of the Afro-Asian peoples, and the revolutionary Afro-Asian writers' movement, after kicking out the Soviet revisionists who have infiltrated the ranks of the Afro-Asian peoples, will develop even more vigorously.

The Permanent Bureau is pleased to announce that the preparations for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held this year in Beijing, which was unanimously adopted by the emergency conference attended by writers from 53 Afro-Asian countries and regions last year, are proceeding satisfactorily.

We proudly say that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a reliable guarantee for the success of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in China this year.

The support and cooperation of the writers and peoples of the countries visited by the Permanent Bureau delegation and other Afro-Asian countries for the Permanent Bureau and the "Third Conference" are another clear guarantee for the success of the "Third Conference" to be held in China and the miserable failure of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut.

We are firmly convinced that the revolutionary and progressive writers of Afro-Asia will unite more closely around our Permanent Bureau, hold high the banner of unity against imperialism, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly smash the line of capitulation and splitism of the Soviet Revisionist splitists, making greater contributions to the cause of Afro-Asian peoples' unity against imperialism.

    亚非作家常设局发表声明揭露苏修分裂和破坏亚非作家运动的严重罪行
    苏修策划贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”是为美帝效劳
    从大量事实中再次得出结论：苏修是美帝的头号帮凶和亚非人民的头号叛徒；反帝必须反修
    今年在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会筹备工作正在令人满意地进行，中国文化大革命的胜利是大会取得成功的保证
    新华社二十二日讯　亚非作家常设局三月二十一日发表重要声明，强调指出亚非作家运动中一直贯串着两条路线的激烈斗争，谴责苏修策划的非法的、分裂的贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”是为美帝效劳的，揭露苏修分裂和破坏亚非作家运动的严重罪行。声明指出：“苏联现代修正主义者是美帝国主义者的头号帮凶和亚非人民的头号叛徒；要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，必须反对以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义。”声明全文如下：
    许多亚非作家组织和民族解放组织在近几个星期中响应了亚非作家常设局的呼吁，发表声明谴责苏修策划的据他们宣称的将于本月底在贝鲁特举行的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”。最近亚非作家常设局两个代表团在成功地访问十二个亚非国家期间，也发表了一系列的联合公报和声明，揭露和谴责了苏修领导集团策划的贝鲁特伪“三大”的阴谋。
    常设局向所有那些亚非革命作家组织和民族解放组织致敬，他们在揭发、声讨和谴责苏修最近策划的反对亚非作家和人民的阴谋中表现出了战斗的团结。
    亚非作家常设局和两大洲战斗的作家组织所有这些革命的行动，大大地加强了我们反帝、反殖运动的团结，彻底揭露了苏联现代修正主义者是美帝国主义者的头号帮凶。
    这里应该指出，在一九五八年第一届亚非作家大会后的八年多中，亚非作家运动中一直贯串着两条路线的激烈斗争。一条是广大亚非进步、革命作家所坚持的坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义，坚决支持亚非人民民族解放斗争的革命路线，这条路线大大地促进了亚非人民的团结反帝事业。另一条是苏修领导集团同美帝国主义妥协勾结、出卖亚非人民革命事业、破坏和分裂亚非作家运动的投降分裂主义路线，苏修这条路线在广大的亚非作家和人民的强烈反对下遭到了可耻的失败。
    这里应该指出，近九年来，苏修为了贩卖他们向美帝国主义投降的路线，常常玩弄两种手法：一是以谈文学为幌子，破坏亚非人民的反帝反殖斗争。但是这个幌子已经被亚非人民识破了，他们在斗争中已经认识到文学和政治是不能分开的。例如：当越南人民和巴勒斯坦人民正在遭受以美国为首的帝国主义者的侵略时，亚非人民和作家怎么能只空谈文学而不给予他们神圣的反帝救国斗争以实际的支持呢？苏修的另一个手法是玩弄假反帝、假支持、假团结的伎俩。确实，他们有时也会装模作样地空喊几句支持越南人民和巴勒斯坦人民解放斗争的话，但谁不知道苏修正在配合美帝兜售“和谈”阴谋，出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争的神圣事业呢？又有谁不知道苏修跟以色列勾勾搭搭出卖巴勒斯坦和其他阿拉伯人民的利益呢？近一年多来，苏修为了进一步贯彻其“美苏合作主宰世界”的路线，越来越自我暴露，现在干脆赤裸裸地投靠美帝国主义，更疯狂地公开分裂亚非人民的团结运动，出卖亚非人民的利益。目前苏修在贝鲁特策划的伪“三大”，使他们对亚非作家运动的破坏活动达到了顶峰。
    由于以森纳那亚克为首的总部设在科伦坡的亚非作家常设局坚持了革命的路线，粉碎了苏修一个又一个的阴谋，苏联修正主义者对革命的亚非作家运动恨之入骨。最近苏联亚非作家联络委员会书记丘古诺夫和苏联亚非作家联络委员会主席阿齐莫夫，亲自出马无耻地对常设局和它的秘书长森纳那亚克先生进行诬蔑，诽谤森纳那亚克秘书长在揭露苏修在贝鲁特策划的伪“三大”这一阴谋方面，和在谴责苏修出卖亚非作家和人民为以美国为首的帝国主义效劳方面“颠倒了事实”。这清楚地证明了他们正好被击中了要害。
    是的，我们已多次明确地宣布，贝鲁特伪“三大”苏修组织者背叛了亚非人民，为以美国为首的帝国主义效劳。我们是掌握了确凿无疑、一清二楚的事实才这样说的。
    让我们来看一看仅是近一年来的事实吧！
    苏联作家协会修正主义领导集团竭尽全力企图破坏一九六六年六月在北京举行的支援越南人民反对美国侵略斗争的亚非作家紧急会议，这难道不是事实吗？
    苏联作家协会修正主义领导集团在紧急会议举行前夕给亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的一份电报中，责问是否有必要来召开支援越南人民反对美国侵略斗争的亚非作家紧急会议，这难道不是事实吗？
    当紧急会议的筹备工作正在进行的时候，这同一个苏联作家协会的修正主义领导集团却在开罗召开了分裂会议，并对常设局和它的秘书长疯狂地进行诬蔑和攻击，这难道不是事实吗？
    这同一个修正主义领导集团策划了巴库分裂会议，对越南人民的斗争假支持、真出卖，这难道不是事实吗？
    这同一个修正主义领导集团在开罗策划了分裂的筹备贝鲁特伪“三大”的会议，这难道不是事实吗？
    这个分裂的伪“筹备委员会”决定向联合国教科文组织乞求给予的所谓“亚非作家协会”和在贝鲁特召开伪“三大”的捐款，这难道不是事实吗？
    美帝国主义者是联合国教科文组织的主要财经供给者，这难道不是事实吗？
    联合国教科文组织是以美国为首的帝国主义在亚非国家以至全世界进行文化侵略的工具，这难道不是事实吗？
    这同一个修正主义领导集团正企图通过联合国教科文组织的协助跟美帝进行文化交易，破坏亚非作家和人民反对帝国主义文化侵略的革命斗争，这难道不是事实吗？
    苏修作协中的一位臭名昭著的诗人叶夫图申科最近访问美国时给肯尼迪献花圈，对这个已死的帝国主义头子表示敬仰，从而赤裸裸地在全世界暴露了苏修作家投降美帝的叛徒面目，这难道不是事实吗？
    去年十一月由苏修在开罗策划的伪“三大”“筹备委员会”会议的文件中，没有一个文件是支持越南人民神圣的抗美救国斗争，没有一个文件是揭露和谴责美帝在侵略越南战争中所犯下的滔天罪行，这难道不是事实吗？
    贝鲁特伪会议的苏修策划者在所有有关会议的文件中，故意地不明确地提到亚非作家和人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争的重要性，这难道不是事实吗？
    贝鲁特伪会议苏修组织者有意回避巴勒斯坦解放问题，以满足他们与之共事的帝国主义的利益，这难道不是事实吗？
    上述种种事实再次证明，非法的、分裂的贝鲁特伪会议的苏修策划者，是确实在为以美国为首的帝国主义效劳。
    我们再一次地得出这样的结论：苏联现代修正主义者是美帝国主义者的头号帮凶和亚非人民的头号叛徒；要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，必须反对以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义。
    我们深信，历史必然会再次证明为伟大的领袖毛泽东主席所指出的一条普遍的真理：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”苏修在一系列分裂会议失败之后在贝鲁特策划的伪“三大”，必将遭到更惨的失败，必将加速苏修的灭亡。伪“三大”的结果因此也只会是“搬起石头打自己的脚”：所有亚非进步作家包括一时受蒙骗的人们，将能更清楚地看到苏修完全投靠美帝、出卖亚非人民利益的丑恶面目，而革命的亚非作家运动在踢开了钻进亚非人民队伍的苏联修正主义者之后，将得到更蓬勃的发展。
    常设局高兴地宣布，去年由五十三个亚非国家和地区的作家参加的亚非作家紧急会议一致通过的今年在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会的筹备工作，正在令人满意地进行。
    我们骄傲地说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是今年在中国举行的第三届亚非作家大会取得成功的可靠保证。
    常设局代表团所访问的国家以及其他亚非国家的作家和人民对常设局和“三大”坚定不渝的支持和合作，是使将在中国举行的“三大”取得成功、使贝鲁特伪“三大”遭到惨败的另一个明确的保证。
    我们坚信，亚非革命的、进步的作家将更紧密地团结在我们常设局的周围，更高地举起团结反帝的旗帜，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地粉碎苏修分裂主义者的投降主义路线，为亚非人民团结反帝事业作出更大的贡献。
