Tanzanian people have unlimited love for Chairman Mao and enthusiastically study Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's words are the truth.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Dar es Salaam on March 4, Tanzanian friends enthusiastically praised, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts." They praised, "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon guiding all revolutionary people and suffering masses in the world to seek a bright future."

Mao Zedong Thought will bloom all over the world.

A friend from Zanzibar sincerely requested the Chinese medical team members who were about to return to China to convey his highest respect and warm greetings to the great Chairman Mao. He said, "I sincerely admire Chairman Mao Zedong's wise leadership and his great thoughts. I firmly believe that Chairman Mao's works are priceless treasures guiding us true revolutionaries in Africa to fight against imperialism and colonialism."

This friend from Zanzibar was once injured in the revolutionary struggle in Zanzibar. As he showed the scar on his arm to the Chinese doctors, he said passionately, "As a revolutionary, I believe that Chairman Mao's words are the truth. I am firmly convinced of this. I love Chairman Mao, I love Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought inspires me to move forward. Therefore, I always wear Chairman Mao's badge." He added, "Mao Zedong Thought will take root and bloom in the hearts of revolutionary people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and all over the world."

Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's people.

A Tanzanian trade union worker often told Chinese friends, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world."

A young technician from Zanzibar named Ali, upon receiving a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that he had long desired, told Chinese friends, "Chairman Mao's works are the truth of revolution. My friends and I all love to read the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' To continue moving forward, I must study Chairman Mao's works."

A Tanzanian journalist wrote in a letter to a Chinese magazine, "Chairman Mao belongs to all revolutionary people—he belongs to you and to us. He is the most outstanding leader in history, and the thoughts he embodies in his works are the beacon guiding all revolutionary people and suffering masses in the world to seek a bright future." He exclaimed in his letter, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Oppressed people must study Chairman Mao's works.

More and more Tanzanian revolutionary youth pay attention to studying Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," as well as "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and apply what they have learned to their daily lives and work. A leader of the youth movement in Zanzibar said after studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Now there are two great mountains pressing down on the African people. One is imperialism, and the other is colonialism. We should mobilize the people, organize the people, and remove these two great mountains from Africa."

    坦桑尼亚人民无限热爱毛主席，热情学习毛泽东思想
    毛主席的话就是真理
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆四日电　坦桑尼亚朋友热情称颂“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖”、“毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳”。他们赞扬“毛泽东思想是全世界革命人民和受苦受难的群众寻求光明前途的灯塔”。
    毛泽东思想将在全世界开花
    一位桑给巴尔朋友诚恳地请求即将回国的中国医疗队的医生向伟大的毛主席致以崇高敬意和亲切问候。他说：“我衷心钦佩毛泽东主席的英明领导和他的伟大思想。我坚信，毛主席著作是指导我们真正革命者在非洲进行反帝反殖斗争的无价之宝。”
    这位桑给巴尔朋友曾经在桑给巴尔革命斗争中受过伤。他一边指着他的胳臂上的伤疤给中国医生看，一边满怀激情地说：“作为一个革命者，我认为，毛主席的话就是真理。我对此坚信不移。我爱毛主席，我爱毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想鼓舞着我前进。因此，我总是戴着毛主席像章。”他又说：“毛泽东思想将在非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲以及全世界革命人民的心中生根开花。”
    毛主席是世界人民的伟大领袖
    一位坦桑尼亚工会工作者经常对中国朋友说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖”。
    一位名叫阿里的桑给巴尔青年技工在得到一本他渴望已久的《毛主席语录》时对中国朋友说，“毛主席著作是革命的真理。我和朋友们都非常爱读《毛主席语录》。为了继续前进，我一定要学习毛主席著作。”
    一位坦桑尼亚新闻工作者在写给一家中国杂志的信中说：“毛主席属于所有革命人民——他属于你们，也属于我们。他是历史上最杰出的领袖，他在著作中所体现的思想是全世界革命人民和受苦受难的群众寻求光明前途的灯塔。”他在信中欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    被压迫人民必须学习毛主席著作
    越来越多的坦桑尼亚革命青年注意学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》这三篇光辉著作以及《青年运动的方向》和《将革命进行到底》等著作，并把学到的东西运用到他们的日常生活和工作中去。一位桑给巴尔青年运动领导人在学习了《愚公移山》后说：“现在有两座大山压在我们非洲人民头上。一座是帝国主义，一座是殖民主义。我们应该动员人民，组织人民，从非洲搬掉这两座大山。”
