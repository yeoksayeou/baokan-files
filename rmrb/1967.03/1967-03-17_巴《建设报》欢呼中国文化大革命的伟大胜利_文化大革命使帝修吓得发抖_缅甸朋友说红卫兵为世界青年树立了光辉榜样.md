The *Bangladesh* *Samabesh* recently published an article stating that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a great development of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary era.

The article points out that in this Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of Chinese revolutionary people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The article says: "Today, revolutionary people all over the world are watching China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, because this revolution also embodies their own aspirations."

The article says, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionists are colluding, slandering the Chinese Cultural Revolution, attempting to damage China's lofty prestige. But this is merely their futile wish. This Cultural Revolution proves that the day when imperialism and modern revisionism are sentenced to death will surely come.

The article says, Chairman Mao not only foresaw the danger of modern revisionists seizing power and restoring capitalism in a socialist society but also found a way, through the Cultural Revolution, to heighten the vigilance of hundreds of millions of Chinese people against modern revisionism and to resist and prevent this danger.

The article concludes by saying that the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a source of strength for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle for national independence. This victory makes the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet modern revisionists, tremble.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Burmese friends continue to enthusiastically praise China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A group of Burmese workers said, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great practice of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Chairman Mao is not only the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people, but also the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of all the people of the world. The revolutionary actions taken by the Chinese Red Guards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made a great contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

A teacher said: China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has great significance for the development of the world revolution. This revolution to prevent China from changing color is not only directly related to the Chinese people but also directly related to all the people of the world. We are always united with the Chinese people.

Two Burmese youths said: "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the greatest leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the young Red Guards, with their brave revolutionary actions, have thoroughly shattered the illusions of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism about the younger generation in China. The young Chinese Red Guards have set a brilliant example for the youth of the world."

A Burmese friend named Sheng Wei said: "A supporter of Mao Zedong Thought will never forget that the historical development process of the proletariat will be tortuous. If the proletariat does not eliminate bourgeois ideology from people's minds, the bourgeoisie will not hesitate to eliminate proletarian ideology from the minds of the masses." He said: "We, the Burmese people, together with the revolutionary people of the world, firmly stand on the side of the Chinese revolutionary people, supporting this revolution."

    巴《建设报》欢呼中国文化大革命的伟大胜利
    文化大革命使帝修吓得发抖
    缅甸朋友说红卫兵为世界青年树立了光辉榜样
    新华社拉瓦尔品第电  拉瓦尔品第《建设报》最近发表文章说，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是马克思列宁主义在当代的伟大发展。
    文章指出，在这场文化大革命中，亿万中国革命人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺回了大权。
    文章说：“今天，全世界的革命人民都注视着中国的无产阶级文化大革命，因为这场革命也体现了他们自己的愿望。”
    文章说，美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义者狼狈为奸，诽谤中国无产阶级文化革命，企图损害中国的崇高威望。但是，这只不过是他们的痴心妄想罢了。这场文化革命证明，帝国主义和现代修正主义者被判处死刑的日子定会到来。
    文章说，毛泽东主席不仅预见到在社会主义社会里存在着现代修正主义者篡夺政权复辟资本主义的危险，而且找到了通过文化革命来提高数亿中国人民对现代修正主义的警惕，来抵制和防止这种危险的办法。
    文章最后说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争的力量源泉。这一胜利使得美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联现代修正主义者发抖。
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸朋友继续热情赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    一批缅甸工人说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大实践。他们说：毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅和伟大舵手，而且是全世界人民的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅和伟大舵手。中国红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命中采取的革命行动，对世界革命事业作出了伟大的贡献。
    一位教师说：中国的无产阶级文化大革命对世界革命的发展具有伟大的意义。这场防止中国改变颜色的革命不仅同中国人民直接有关，而且同全世界人民直接有关。我们始终同中国人民心连心。
    两位缅甸青年说：“在世界人民最伟大的领袖毛泽东主席所领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，年青的红卫兵以勇敢的革命行动，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义对中国年青一代所抱的幻想。年青的中国红卫兵为世界青年树立光辉榜样。”
    一个名叫盛魏的缅甸朋友说：“一个毛泽东思想的拥护者决不会忘记，无产阶级的历史发展过程会有曲折。如果无产阶级不清除人们头脑中的资产阶级思想，资产阶级就会毫不犹豫地清除人民群众头脑中的无产阶级思想。”他说：“我们缅甸人民同世界革命人民一道，坚决站在中国革命人民一边，支持这场革命。”
