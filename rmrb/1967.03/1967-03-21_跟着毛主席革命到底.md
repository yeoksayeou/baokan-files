The current situation in Heilongjiang Province's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. A revolutionary storm unprecedented in history has swept across the province, like a sudden storm, irresistible. In this great revolutionary movement, I have received the most profound education.

It was only after the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee that I truly and resolutely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, supported the revolutionary leftists, and humbly learned from the revolutionary youngsters. Before that, I did not understand Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, did not closely follow Chairman Mao's thoughts, said some wrong words, and did some wrong things. I placed myself in the position of leading others to make a revolution and overthrowing others, rather than considering myself as a revolutionary force while also seeing myself as an object of revolution. In the past, fighting against Japanese imperialism, fighting against the Kuomintang, land reform, agricultural cooperation, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, etc., were all about overthrowing others. This time, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has come to our own heads, and we became afraid. The "self" in our minds was playing tricks. The worldview was not thoroughly transformed, and the problem was exposed at this critical moment of class struggle.

At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao achieved a great victory, and the bourgeois reactionary line was declared a failure. Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao's teachings made me realize my mistakes. Reflecting on the past experiences of making a revolution with the masses and examining my current stance and feelings, I felt deeply remorseful. From then on, I made up my mind to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao's teachings also made me realize that only by thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its poison can we implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. To criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, we must first clearly distinguish ourselves from the bourgeois reactionary line.

After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, I returned to Harbin from Beijing and saw the revolutionary Red Guards. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, full of spirit and fighting spirit, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They regarded learning, propagating, implementing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their highest duty. They displayed the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to make a revolution, and dare to rebel, and resolutely launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and all ghosts and monsters, daring to declare war on the old world. They did a lot of good things and made a lot of good suggestions. Things that were not dared to be thought of, they proposed; things that were not done before, they did; old and difficult problems that were not solved before, they solved. They built great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These living facts deeply educated me. I made up my mind to stand on the side of the revolutionary Red Guards and fight shoulder to shoulder with them. At that time, I also considered that doing so would definitely encounter various criticisms and attacks, and encounter various obstacles and difficulties. However, to uphold the truth and correct mistakes, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and decided to firmly follow Chairman Mao to revolution to the end.

The path I have taken is not smooth, and every step forward requires struggle. There is struggle with one's own wrong thoughts, struggle with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, struggle with the conservatives, and struggle with counter-revolutionary organizations. This struggle is very sharp and complex. Based on the practice of struggle, I would like to share the following points:

Be Bold and Mobilize the Masses

Whether to put "dare" first or "fear" first, whether to mobilize the masses or suppress them, whether to dare to practice great democracy or fear great democracy, is a problem that a revolutionary cadre should solve first.

A prominent feature of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, it widely adopts big debates, big-character posters, big connections, and big struggles, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves; using such great democracy to overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to ensure that our country will never change color. This is Chairman Mao's great innovation, a major development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We have always advocated that the revolution relies on the masses, everyone participates, and opposes relying only on a few people to issue orders." However, before the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, I did not implement Chairman Mao's instructions. I did not mobilize the masses. This is because, for a long time, I have developed the habit of being an official and a lord. Once my personal so-called dignity and face are destroyed, I feel uncomfortable; I am also unwilling to break the old frameworks and old rules that have formed over a long period, always wanting to maintain the status quo. At the same time, I was not prepared for the great democracy under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and felt it was sudden.

As for the handful of power-holders within the former Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road, they stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, consistently opposed the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and in the Cultural Revolution, they would certainly suppress the revolutionary mass movement and resolutely oppose great democracy. Because, mobilizing the masses and practicing great democracy, they would be overthrown.

After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, following Chairman Mao's instructions, I resolutely stood with the masses, firmly supported the revolutionary Red Guards, mobilized the masses, and practiced great democracy, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, and launched a sharp struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road.

In the struggle, conservative forces inside and outside the Party used various means to attack me, even issuing posters to call for a struggle meeting against me. I was mentally prepared and remained firm in the struggle after their repeated attacks. They thought that in this way, they could isolate me and overthrow me. However, I firmly believe that as long as I follow Chairman Mao and stand with the genuine leftists and the broad masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, I will not be isolated. In the struggle, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee gave me endless courage and strength, and the leftists gave me great support and help.

The leftists have a clear class standpoint and a clear distinction between right and wrong in dealing with all matters, and they handle various problems reasonably. They have done what is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and opposed what is not in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, a revolutionary cadre who fears great democracy and fears the masses is completely unreasonable.

Master the Direction of the Struggle

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution," and it is also the primary question in the Cultural Revolution. The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution clearly points out: "The focus of this movement is to criticize those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." Before the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, I deviated from Chairman Mao's instructions on this issue, proposing to "expose both internal and external issues" and "expose whatever there is," without highlighting the focus of the movement and diverting the direction of the struggle, temporarily leading the movement astray. The main reason for this mistake is that I used my old experience to deal with this Cultural Revolution, holding the wrong attitude of criticizing others but not myself, criticizing those below but not above, only overthrowing others but not myself. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "We must regard ourselves as a part of the revolutionary force, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution." But at that time, I had insufficient understanding and poor performance in overthrowing myself.

As for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they desperately used various tricks to divert the direction of the movement. For example, they incited the masses to fight against the masses, used the sugar-coated bullets of economism to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, and used false seizures of power to deceive the masses, etc.

Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and in the struggle between the two lines, through a large number of facts, I recognized my mistakes and also saw through the reactionary nature of the class enemies. I firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and, together with the leftists, called on the broad revolutionary masses to bombard the handful of power-holders within the Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road. As for my personal mistakes, I also welcome the broad revolutionary masses to expose and criticize them. What is wrong with a revolutionary cadre in a great mass movement to have his shortcomings and mistakes bombarded and burned away? The revolutionary masses said well: "We do not want to label some cadres as anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. For those who are not anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, we hope to 'struggle' them into genuine leftists." These words touched me deeply. Practice has proved that the Red Guards are following Chairman Mao, and the general direction is always correct.

Identify the Genuine Leftists and Firmly Rely on Them

In any revolutionary stage, it is necessary to clarify the objects and driving forces of the revolution, that is, to rely on whom, unite with whom, and strike whom. As Chairman Mao taught, this "is the basic basis for understanding all revolutionary questions." In Harbin, after a relatively long period of testing, it was proved that the Red Guards are the genuine leftists. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, their general direction has always been correct, such as launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line; opposing economism; focusing on the revolution and promoting production; and uniting to seize power, etc. The Red Guards resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, always took the lead, finally exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Heilongjiang Province, and achieved the great unity of the revolutionary leftists, seizing back the Party power, political power, economic power, and cultural power usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These victories should be attributed to the great Mao Zedong Thought and to the broad Red Guards.

In the long-term struggle, I established a fighting friendship with the Red Guards, gradually aligning our stances and feelings. I encouraged and supported their correct aspects, criticized their shortcomings and mistakes, and timely gave them suggestions. Specifically, I did the following: first, I propagated Mao Zedong Thought to them, helped them follow Chairman Mao, and acted according to Mao Zedong Thought; second, I insisted on principles, propagated the Party's policies, strategies, and tactics; third, I firmly helped the Red Guards to counterattack those who opposed them. Because of this, the broad Red Guards gave great support to each of my revolutionary actions and criticized and helped me for my words and deeds that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Because of this, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road desperately opposed me, attacked me, and even spread rumors to sabotage my relationship with the leftists. They often seized on some shortcomings of the Red Guards, attacking one point and ignoring the rest, attempting to force me to speak out and wanting to use my hand to suppress the student movement. I saw through their tricks and resolutely counterattacked them with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, in Harbin, several incidents of besieging revolutionary students were promptly quelled.

In the struggle to identify and support the leftists, I encountered many criticisms. For example, some people said: How do you know who the leftists are? What if the leftists change their minds halfway? In fact, as long as we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, these problems can be solved. After all, identifying and relying on the leftists is a matter of stance, a matter of believing in the masses, and a major matter of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Distinguish the Mainstream and the Side Streams

Chairman Mao pointed out in his "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" that there are three different attitudes towards the revolutionary mass movement: "Standing at their head to lead them? Or standing behind them to criticize them with gestures? Or standing against them to oppose them?" In the Cultural Revolution, we also have these three different attitudes here. Looking at the former Provincial Party Committee members, those who belong to the first attitude are few, and those who belong to the third attitude are also few, while those who criticize with gestures are not few. Especially after the lid of class struggle within the Provincial Party Committee was lifted, the movement developed rapidly, and the situation was very good. Although some shortcomings and problems appeared at that time, the mainstream of the movement was healthy, and the general direction was always correct. However, some people regarded the situation at that time as "very bad," saying that the "scope of attack was too wide," "some good cadres were injured," "no one was in charge of work," etc. At that time, my situation was very difficult, and conservative forces from all sides came to attack me, accuse me, shout loudly, and say that the general direction of the movement was wrong. Every time such a critical moment came, Chairman Mao pointed out the direction in time, enabling us to see through and smash the enemy's various tricks and plots, and continuously push the movement forward. For example, in September last year, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the conservative forces, in order to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, incited some workers who did not understand the truth to oppose the student movement. At this time, the People's Daily published the editorial "Workers, Peasants, and Revolutionary Students Unite Under the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought." Again, in December last year, when the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road attempted to reverse the direction of the movement with economism, the Central Committee issued the directive on opposing economism. The facts have proved that every victory we have achieved in the movement is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Of course, there are also shortcomings and problems in the movement, but they are after all side streams. On this issue, people with different stances have different views. Those who support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution always see the mainstream of the movement first, and their conclusion is "very good"; those who oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution always see only the side streams of the movement, so they shout "very bad." This phenomenon is not strange.

Overthrow the "Self" and Establish the "Public"

The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Sixteen Points, points out that we must be bold and mobilize the masses. My understanding is that to be bold and mobilize the masses, we must first overthrow the "self" in our minds, remove selfish thoughts, and not be afraid to lose personal interests. Otherwise, we will not dare to mobilize the masses, will not be able to insist on principles, and will not be able to gain the trust of the masses. In the movement, there are several situations: some people are afraid of being ugly, afraid of pain, afraid of losing their positions, and do not dare to publicly admit their mistakes and make deep self-criticisms; some people do not actively support the reasonable suggestions and revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses, do not solve the problems that should be solved, and turn small problems that are easy to solve into big problems; some people, under the pressure of conservatives, do things that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to relieve themselves. The essence is that the "self" is playing tricks. Fear of the masses and fear of the revolution are manifestations of political instability. Every revolutionary cadre must thoroughly overthrow the "self," make a revolution in the depths of one's soul, eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts, break private interests and establish public interests, stand on the proletarian revolutionary stance, and actively participate in the mass movement.

An old cadre must pass the test of the Cultural Revolution. The key is to discard the "self" and "regard revolutionary interests as the first life." From the day I publicly spoke in support of the Red Guards after the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, I noticed that the conservatives would not let me go. As expected, the conservative "August 8th Group" has been continuously attacking me in shifts since August 18 last year, spreading rumors, inciting trouble, and insulting and abusing me in an attempt to overthrow me. In this sharp and complex class struggle, we should not consider personal gains and losses. If you support and rely on the leftists, the conservatives and reactionaries will certainly hate you and attack you. Fantasizing about standing above all factions, not leaning to either side, not offending one faction and not offending another faction, attempting to avoid struggle and not be attacked, is completely wrong and impossible. This idea and approach actually stand on the side of the conservatives and the rightists.

Now, the revolutionary leftists in Heilongjiang Province, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved a major victory in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, this is only the first step of the long march, and more arduous tasks lie ahead. Although my soul has been touched, it is not profound. In the future, I will stand more firmly with the Red Guards, be a student of the masses, and forever follow our great leader Chairman Mao to revolution to the end.

    跟着毛主席革命到底
    潘复生
    当前，黑龙江省的无产阶级文化大革命是一派大好形势。一场史无前例的革命风暴席卷全省，其势如暴风骤雨，锐不可挡。在这场伟大的革命运动中，我受到了一次最深刻的教育。
    我真正坚决地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，支持革命左派，虚心地向革命小将学习，是在党的八届十一中全会以后。在这以前，我对毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命很不理解，没有紧跟毛主席思想，说了一些错话，做了一些错事。我把自己摆在领导人家革命、革人家的命的位置上，而没有在把自己当作革命力量的同时，也把自己当作革命的对象。过去打日本帝国主义、打蒋介石，土地改革，农业合作化，资本主义工商业改造，等等，都是革别人的命。这次无产阶级文化大革命，革到自己头上来了，自己就害怕起来。自己头脑里的“私”字在作怪。世界观未彻底改造好，在这场阶级斗争的关键时刻，问题就暴露出来了。
    十一中全会上，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大胜利，资产阶级反动路线宣告失败。毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的教导，使我认识到自己的错误。回忆过去和群众一道闹革命的经历，检查自己现在的立场、感情，真是十分沉痛。从那时起，我就下定决心，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的教导，也使我认识到，只有彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒，才能贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。而要批判资产阶级反动路线，首先要彻底同资产阶级反动路线划清界线。
    十一中全会以后，我从北京回到哈尔滨，看到革命的红色造反团，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，意气风发，斗志昂扬，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想看成是自己的最高职责。他们发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，坚决地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神进行了猛攻，敢于向旧世界宣战。他们做了大量好事，提出了大量的好创议。过去不敢想的，他们提出来了；过去办不到的事，他们做到了；过去不能解决的“老大难”问题，他们解决了。他们在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，建树了伟大的功勋。这些活生生的事实，深刻地教育了我。我下定决心，站在革命的红色造反团一边，和他们并肩战斗。当时，我也考虑到这样做，一定会遭到这样或那样的责难和攻击，会遇到各式各样的阻挠和困难。但是，为了坚持真理，修正错误，我遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，决心坚定不移地紧跟毛主席革命到底。
    我走过的这段路程，并不是平坦的，每前进一步，都要经过斗争。这里面有和自己错误思想的斗争，有和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，有和保守派的斗争，有和反革命组织的斗争。这场斗争是非常尖锐和复杂的。根据斗争实践，谈谈下列几点体会。
      敢字当头，放手发动群众
    “敢”字当头，还是“怕”字当头，放手发动群众，还是压制群众，敢于实行大民主，还是害怕大民主，这是一个革命领导干部应该首先解决的问题。
    这次无产阶级文化大革命的一个突出特点，就是在无产阶级专政的条件下，广泛采取大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己；运用这样的大民主，斗倒、斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以保证我们的国家永远不改变颜色。这是毛主席的伟大创举，这是毛泽东思想在新的历史条件下一个重大发展。
    毛主席早就指出：“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”但是，在十一中全会以前，我却没有执行毛主席的这个教导。没有放手发动群众。这是因为长期以来，养成一种做官当老爷的习惯，一旦把个人那套所谓尊严、体面打掉了，心里就不舒服；对长期以来形成的一些旧框框、旧章法也不愿打破，总想维持现状。同时，对于无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，没有思想准备，感到很突然。
    至于前省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们站在反动资产阶级立场上，一贯反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想，在文化大革命中，他们必然要镇压革命群众运动，坚决反对大民主。因为，放手发动群众，实行大民主，他们就要垮台了。
    十一中全会以后，遵照毛主席的教导，我坚决地和群众站在一起，坚决支持革命的红色造反团，放手发动群众，实行大民主，彻底批判了资产阶级反动路线，同省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了尖锐的斗争。
    在斗争过程中，党内外的保守势力，用各种办法攻击我，甚至发海报要开大会斗争我。我思想上做了充分准备，在他们多次围攻以后，我仍然坚持斗争。他们以为，这样就可以把我孤立起来，整垮我。但是，我坚信，只要紧跟毛主席，同毛泽东思想武装起来的真正革命左派和广大革命群众站在一起，并不孤立。在斗争中，毛主席和党中央给了我无穷的勇气和力量，革命左派给了我极大的支持和帮助。
    革命左派对待一切事物，都有鲜明的阶级观点和是非界限，处理各种问题都是通情达理的。他们做到了凡是符合毛泽东思想的就拥护，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的就反对。所以一个革命领导干部，怕大民主，怕群众，是完全没有道理的。
    掌握斗争的大方向
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”，也是文化大革命中的首要问题。党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定明确指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”在十一中全会以前，我在这个问题上，违背了毛主席的指示，提出了“内外一齐揭”，“有什么揭什么”，没有突出运动的重点，转移了斗争大方向，一度把运动引向了邪路。发生这个错误的原因，主要是自己用过去的老经验来对待这次文化大革命，抱着整人不整己，整下不整上，只革别人的命，不革自己的命的错误态度。林彪同志指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”而我当时对革自己的命是认识不足的，做得不好的。
    至于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，则是拚命地采取各种各样的花招来转移运动大方向。比如挑动群众斗群众，用经济主义的糖衣炮弹腐蚀群众的革命意志，用假夺权来蒙骗群众，等等。
    在毛泽东思想教育下，在两条路线斗争中，通过大量事实，我认识到了自己的错误，同时也认清了阶级敌人的反动本质。我坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，和左派一道，号召广大革命群众炮轰省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。对我个人的错误，也欢迎广大革命群众揭发、批判。一个革命的领导干部，在伟大的群众运动中，把自己的缺点、错误轰掉、烧掉，又有什么不好呢？革命群众说得好：“我们对一些领导干部并不是都想打成反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的分子，对于不是反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的人，我们是希望把他‘打’成真正的革命左派。”这些话使我很感动。实践证明，红色造反团是紧跟毛主席的，大方向始终是正确的。
    发现真正的左派，坚决依靠左派
    在任何一个革命阶段中，都必须弄清革命对象和革命动力，即依靠谁，团结谁，打击谁这个根本问题。正象毛主席所教导的，这“乃是认清一切革命问题的基本的根据。”在哈尔滨，经过比较长期的考验，证明红色造反团是真正的革命左派，他们从无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，大方向始终是正确的，例如向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火；批判资产阶级反动路线；反对经济主义；抓革命，促生产；大联合夺权，等等。红色造反团坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，始终走在最前边，终于揭开了黑龙江省阶级斗争的盖子，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并实现了无产阶级革命派大联合，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃踞的党权、政权、财权、文权夺回来了。这些胜利应该归功于伟大的毛泽东思想，归功于广大的红色造反者。
    在长期斗争中，我和红色造反者建立了战斗的友谊，从立场到感情逐渐一致。我鼓励和支持他们的正确方面，批评他们的缺点和错误，及时向他们提出建议。具体的说就是：第一，向他们宣传毛泽东思想，帮助他们紧跟毛主席，按毛泽东思想办事；第二，坚持原则，宣传党的方针、政策和策略；第三，谁反对红色造反者，我就坚决地帮助红色造反者进行反击。正因为这样，广大红色造反者对我的每一个革命行动，都给予极大的支持，对我的不符合毛泽东思想的言行都给予批评和帮助。正因为这样，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，拚命地反对我，攻击我，甚至制造谣言破坏我和左派的关系。他们往往抓住红色造反者的一些缺点，攻其一点，不及其余，企图以此逼迫我站出来讲话，妄想借我的手去压制学生运动。我识破了他们的阴谋，就坚决用毛泽东思想向他们反击。因此，在哈尔滨几次发生围攻革命学生的事件，都及时平息下去。
    在发现和支持左派的斗争中，我遇到不少的责难。如有人说：你怎么知道谁是左派？如果左派中途变了怎么办？实际上，只要按照毛泽东思想办事，这些问题都好解决。归根到底，发现和依靠左派，是个立场问题，是相信群众的问题，是贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。
      分清主流和支流
    毛主席早在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中指出，对待革命群众运动有三种不同态度：“站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？”在文化大革命运动中，我们这里同样存在这样三种不同的态度。就前省委领导成员来看，属于第一种态度的人是少数，属于第三种态度的人也是少数，而指手画脚的人，则是不少的。特别是揭开省委内阶级斗争的盖子之后，运动发展迅猛异常，形势好得很。尽管当时出现了一些缺点和问题，而运动的主流是健康的，大方向始终是正确的。但是，有些人却把当时的形势看成“糟得很”，说什么“打击面宽了”，“有些好干部被伤害了”，“没有人抓工作了”，等等。当时，我的处境非常困难，各方面的保守势力都来攻击我，指责我，大喊大叫，胡说运动大方向错了。每逢这样的关键时刻，毛主席都及时指出了方向，使我们能够识破和粉碎敌人的种种阴谋诡计，不断地把运动推向前进。例如，去年九月份，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和保守势力为了破坏文化大革命，便挑动不明真相的一些工人反对学生运动。这时候，《人民日报》发表了《工农群众和革命学生在毛泽东思想旗帜下团结起来》的社论。又如，去年十二月，当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图用经济主义扭转运动大方向的时候，中央又发布了关于反对经济主义的指示。事实证明，我们在运动中取得的每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    当然，在运动中也有缺点和问题，但它毕竟是支流。对于这个问题，站在不同立场上的人有不同的看法。拥护无产阶级文化大革命的，他们总是首先看到运动的主流，他们的结论是“好得很”；反对无产阶级文化大革命的，他们总是只看运动的支流，因此他们就叫嚷“糟得很”。这种现象并不奇怪。
      打倒“私”字，树立“公”字
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定即十六条指出，要“敢”字当头，放手发动群众。我的体会是，要“敢”字当头，放手发动群众，首先要打倒自己头脑中的“私”字，去掉私心杂念，不怕丢掉个人的利益，否则就不敢于放手发动群众，就不能坚持原则，也就不能取得群众的信任。在运动中有这样几种情况：有的人怕丑，怕痛，怕丢官，不敢公开承认错误，做深刻检查；有的对革命群众的合理创议和革命行动，不积极支持，该解决的问题不解决，本来容易解决的小问题变成了大问题；有的在保守派的压力下，为了解脱自己，办了一些不符合毛泽东思想、不符合党的政策的事。实质上都是“私”字作怪。害怕群众，害怕革命，这是政治上不坚定的表现。我们每个革命干部，必须彻底造“私”字的反，在自己的灵魂深处大闹革命，灭资兴无，破私立公，站在无产阶级革命立场上，积极投入群众运动中去。
    一个老干部，要过好文化大革命这一关，关键在于丢掉“私”字，“以革命利益为第一生命”。从十一中全会后我公开讲话支持红色造反团那一天起，我就察觉到，保守派会抓住我不放。事实没有出我所料，保守派的“八八团”，从去年八月十八日起，一直采取轮番围攻，造谣挑拨，侮辱谩骂等办法，企图把我打倒。在这种尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们决不应该考虑个人的利害得失。你要支持和依靠左派，当然保守派、反动派会仇视你，打击你。幻想站在几派之上，不偏不倚，既不得罪这一派，又不得罪那一派，企图避免斗争，不受攻击，那是完全错误的，也是根本不可能的。这种想法和做法，实际上是站到了保守派和右派一边。
    现在，黑龙江省的无产阶级革命派，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，已经取得了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的重大胜利。但是，这只是万里长征的第一步，更艰巨的任务还在后头。我个人的灵魂虽然也触动了，但还不深刻。今后，我要更加坚定地和红色造反者站在一起，当群众的小学生，永远跟着我们伟大的领袖毛主席革命到底。
