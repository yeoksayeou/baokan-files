The U.S. aggressors, still reeling from their previous shock, were once again bombarded. On the night of March 15, the liberation forces in the Saigon-Cho Lon region launched a fierce artillery attack on the base of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade, achieving a brilliant victory. According to statistics, over 300 U.S. aggressors were killed or wounded, 10 enemy aircraft were destroyed or damaged, 36 enemy vehicles and 3 artillery pieces were destroyed or damaged, one ammunition depot and one oil depot were destroyed, over 100 barracks were demolished, and the base's communication facilities were also destroyed.

On the night of March 15, the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade, which had been routed by the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province, had just returned to their lair in the Dong Nhi area of Go Vap County. The liberation forces, seizing the moment when these invaders were still in shock, immediately launched a fierce assault. The concentrated artillery fire accurately hit the targets, inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. aggressors who had suffered consecutive defeats in the Binh Dinh battlefield.

According to another report, in February, the military and civilians in the northern region of Quang Nam Province launched continuous attacks, annihilating over 1,000 enemy troops. Among them, the guerrilla forces and local troops in Dien Ban County fought 33 battles from February 5 to 22, annihilating 705 U.S. aggressors and 100 puppet soldiers, shooting down 4 enemy aircraft, and destroying or damaging 16 armored vehicles.

In the latter half of February, the guerrilla forces in Long Thanh and Thuan Loc counties of Binh Duong Province repeatedly ambushed the enemy on the transportation lines, annihilating 121 U.S. and puppet soldiers, and destroying or damaging 7 military vehicles. The guerrilla forces in Tay Me and Phu Thinh communes of Go Vap County, Cho Lon Province, set up a large minefield from March 1 to 4, destroying 14 enemy armored vehicles and other military vehicles, and annihilating over 40 U.S. aggressors.
