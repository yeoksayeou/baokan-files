The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee calls on all revolutionary masses in the city to prioritize the overall interests, listen to Chairman Mao's words, unite in large numbers by unit and department, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights, break down the "self" and establish the "public," sweep away all non-proletarian ideological tendencies that hinder great unity, and reorganize the troops in new forms, uniting the proletarian revolutionary masses in a unified revolutionary organization.

A public letter from the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee dated March 2, 1967, to all proletarian revolutionary masses in the city:

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the entire city, revolutionary comrades:

In the current situation, what form should the proletarian revolutionary masses adopt to organize the revolutionary forces? This is a pressing issue that everyone is concerned about and needs to be resolved. Recently, the New China News Agency has broadcasted the experiences of Shanghai and Guizhou in solving this problem to the entire nation. On March 1, the People's Daily published an editorial titled "A Good Form of Great Unity Among the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses," conveying the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions on solving this problem. This is very timely and meets our needs. This is Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's greatest concern and encouragement for us once again.

The various revolutionary organizations currently in our city were mostly established in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary masses broke through the layers of barriers imposed by the bourgeois reactionary line, transcending the boundaries between units, departments, and systems, and consciously established these organizations through large-scale connections. At that time, such actions were completely necessary. These revolutionary organizations played a significant role in organizing and mobilizing the masses during the earlier stages of the Cultural Revolution. They bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, destroyed one bourgeois stronghold after another, defeated one conservative organization after another, and repelled the repeated counterattacks of counter-revolutionary economism. In the recent struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, they also foiled the enemy's plot to seize power back. In summary, they have made immortal contributions to the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao and written a glorious chapter.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything for the victory of the front line, organizational tasks must serve political tasks." The movement has now developed to a new stage, the decisive battle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. On January 22, the proletarian revolutionary masses in our city, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, seized the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers that had been held by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, establishing the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ—the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Since then, the overall situation of the cultural revolution in our city has undergone fundamental changes, and many new combat tasks have been presented to the proletarian revolutionary masses in the entire city. Facing this new situation and tasks, the original form of revolutionary organizations that transcended industries, departments, and systems has become increasingly inappropriate.

In the future, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, many tasks will be implemented and carried out according to systems, industries, units, and departments. Moreover, within a system, industry, unit, or department, the proletarian revolutionary masses have common combat goals, common tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and common tasks of "grasp revolution, promote production." This urgently requires a revolutionary organization established according to systems, units, departments, and regions to provide unified leadership, so as to form a unified and coordinated whole. However, the current revolutionary organizations that transcend industries, departments, and systems are not suitable for this. They often cause revolutionary rebels in a unit or department to belong to many self-contained revolutionary organizations, acting on their own or even opposing each other, seriously hindering the unity of combat steps. This not only hinders the completion of common tasks but also fosters localism and sectarianism, which is not conducive to the ideological revolutionization of proletarian revolutionary masses. Moreover, due to the large organizational structure of these revolutionary organizations, it is difficult for them to accurately understand the specific situations of some individuals and organizations in various units and departments, making it easy for them to be deceived and misled by a few cunning individuals, providing an opportunity for them to infiltrate the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The shortcomings of these revolutionary organizations that transcend industries, departments, and systems, which are not suitable for the current situation, have been increasingly exposed in many units and departments in our city. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall interests of the revolution, according to the new situation and tasks of the Cultural Revolution, it is necessary to make corresponding improvements and adjustments to the original organizational forms, especially to some revolutionary organizations that transcend industries, departments, and systems.

How to improve and adjust the organizational forms? Our principle is that it should be conducive to the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, conducive to the grassroots seizure of power, conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and achieving the "three-in-one combination," conducive to "grasp revolution, promote production," conducive to the completion of struggle, criticism, and transformation tasks in various units, conducive to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and conducive to the ideological revolutionization of the proletarian revolutionary masses. In terms of specific measures, we have decided to unite the proletarian revolutionary masses in a unified revolutionary organization according to units and departments, and then, from the bottom up, according to industries, systems, and regions, implement the great unity of vertical and horizontal combinations. This form of great unity is the need of the current combat situation and tasks, the demand of the broad revolutionary masses, in line with the spirit of the editorial of the People's Daily on March 1, and also the proven effective experience of Shanghai and Guizhou regions.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the fundamental guarantees for the success of our cause." The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee calls on all proletarian revolutionary masses in the city to resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the decisions of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, quickly learn from and promote the experiences of Shanghai and Guizhou, and under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly implement the great unity according to units and departments, so as to better grasp and use the power that has been seized, establish and consolidate the new revolutionary order, and more powerfully implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

To achieve this new form of great unity among the proletarian revolutionary masses, it must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, which is the soul of the great unity. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must advocate considering the overall situation. Every party member, every local work, every speech or action must start from the interests of the entire party, and it is absolutely not allowed to violate this principle." All revolutionary organizations must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and unite and combine on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Some large revolutionary organizations in certain units think that they have many people, great merits, and that the unity should be based on them, requiring other revolutionary organizations to merge into their own organization; some revolutionary organizations act on their own and do not want to unite. These are manifestations of localism, sectarianism, and dispersionism, which are against Mao Zedong Thought and must be corrected. Revolution does not distinguish between early and late, and organization does not distinguish between large and small. How to unite is determined by what is beneficial to the revolution. On some minor issues, if there are different opinions, they should be subordinated to the major direction of the struggle and unified on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and should not affect the great unity because of this. At this critical moment when the Cultural Revolution is deepening, whether or not to implement the great unity according to units and departments is a touchstone to test whether an organization is revolutionary, whether it is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, whether it is listening to Chairman Mao's words, and whether the rectification is truly effective. This is a severe test for every revolutionary organization.

Members of revolutionary organizations that transcend industries, departments, and systems should quickly return to their original units and departments according to the decisions of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee and participate in the unified revolutionary organization. Especially the heads of liaison headquarters and branches should take the lead in returning to their original units and making revolution together with the broad revolutionary masses. Some comrades have emotional attachments to the revolutionary organizations established in the arduous struggle and are reluctant to return to their units, even considering only personal or small group gains and losses, and their thoughts are not clear. Obviously, this is because the "self" is at work. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chinese Communists who start from the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people believe that their cause is completely just, are willing to sacrifice their personal interests, and are ready to give their lives for our cause at any time. Is there any thought, viewpoint, opinion, or method that does not meet the needs of the people and is reluctant to give up?" We hope these comrades will "start from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups," discard various selfish thoughts, prioritize revolutionary interests, and go where they are needed. The original revolutionary organizations in various units should warmly welcome and strongly support the revolutionary comrades who return. With the agreement of the masses, they can also be invited to participate in the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs. For some comrades who have made certain mistakes, they should not be discriminated against after they return. They should be educated and united with the attitude of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." We must, as Chairman Mao teaches, "not only unite with those who agree with us but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." Currently, various revolutionary organizations are carrying out the rectification movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, which is very beneficial for achieving the new great unity. The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee requires you to quickly push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new height, thoroughly carry out rectification, break down the "self" and establish the "public," sweep away all non-proletarian ideological tendencies such as localism, sectarianism, small groupism, and anarchism that hinder the great unity, reorganize the troops in new forms, and unite the proletarian revolutionary masses in a unified revolutionary organization.

"The enemy will not disappear on its own," and "imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to defeat." Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the entire city, we must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings. When we implement the great unity according to units and departments in the new situation and make improvements and adjustments to the organizational forms, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehard reactionaries such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will surely take the opportunity to spread malicious rumors, stir up trouble, sow discord, create controversies, and engage in sabotage and disruption. The class enemies are most afraid of our better implementation of the great unity in the new situation because we implement a broader and tighter great unity, they will be more isolated, and their days will be even harder. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant, guard against the sabotage and disruption of class enemies, expose their various tricks and evil activities at any time, and give them a resolute and powerful blow.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the entire city, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, form a vast army of the cultural revolution, advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 听毛主席的话按单位按部门大联合

    青岛市革命委员会号召全市无产阶级革命派一切从全局利益出发
    听毛主席的话按单位按部门大联合
    把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，扫除一切妨碍大联合的非无产阶级思想倾向，按照新的形式整顿队伍，把无产阶级革命派组织在统一的革命组织中。
    新华社济南五日电　青岛市革命委员会三月二日发出给全市无产阶级革命派的公开信，号召他们在新形势下按单位、按部门实行大联合。这封公开信全文如下：全市无产阶级革命派的战士们，革命的同志们：
    在当前的斗争形势下，无产阶级革命派应该采用什么样的形式来组织革命队伍呢？这是大家都很关心的急待解决的问题。最近新华社向全国播发了上海、贵州有关解决这个问题的经验，三月一日《人民日报》又以《无产阶级革命派大联合的好形式》为题发表社论，传达了党中央对于解决这个问题的指示精神。这是十分及时、十分切合我们的需要的。这是毛主席、党中央又一次对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。
    本市现有的各革命组织，大都是在无产阶级文化大革命初期，无产阶级革命派为了冲破资产阶级反动路线的层层障碍，打破了单位之间、部门之间、系统之间的界限，进行大串连，自觉地建立起来的。在那种情况下，那样做是完全必要的。这些革命组织在前段文化大革命中，对组织群众，发动群众，起了重大的作用。它们勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，摧毁了一个又一个资产阶级的顽固堡垒，打垮了一个又一个保皇组织，打退了反革命经济主义一次又一次的反扑；在最近向前青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，又粉碎了阶级敌人反夺权的阴谋。总之，它们在青岛无产阶级文化大革命的历史上，立下了不朽的功勋，写下了光辉的一页。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务。”现在运动已经发展到了一个新的阶段，即向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的决战阶段。一月二十二日，本市无产阶级革命派大联合，在中国人民解放军的大力支持下，一举夺了被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所把持的青岛市委、市人委的党、政、财、文大权，建立了“三结合”的临时权力机构——青岛市革命委员会。从此，本市文化革命的整个形势发生了新的根本变化，许多新的战斗任务提到全市无产阶级革命派的面前来了。面对着这新的形势和任务，原来那些跨行跨业跨部门的革命组织的形式，就越来越显得不相适应了。
    今后，在市革命委员会的统一领导下，许多工作都要按系统按行业按单位按部门来贯彻进行，而且在一个系统、一个行业、一个单位、一个部门中，无产阶级革命派有着共同的斗争目标，有着共同的斗、批、改的任务，有着共同的“抓革命，促生产”的任务。这就迫切要求有一个按系统、按单位、按部门、按地区成立的革命组织来统一领导，以便形成一个步调整齐一致的整体。而现在的一些跨行跨业跨部门的革命组织，则是与此很不适应的。它们往往使一个单位、一个部门的革命造反者，分属于许多自成系统的革命组织，在下面各自为政，甚至互相对立，严重妨碍着大家战斗步调的一致。这样，不仅不利于共同任务的完成，而且助长了小团体主义和宗派主义，不利于无产阶级革命派成员的思想革命化。另外，由于这些革命组织机构庞大，对各单位、各部门的一些人和一些组织的具体情况难以确切了解，还容易受个别的削尖了脑袋的坏家伙的欺骗和蒙蔽，给他们以钻进无产阶级革命派队伍的空子。跨行跨业跨部门的革命组织的这些不适应当前形势的弊病，已经在本市的许多单位和部门中，越来越多地暴露出来了。因此，从革命的全局利益出发，按照文化大革命的新形势和新任务的需要，对原有的一些组织形式，特别是对一些跨行跨业跨部门的革命组织，加以相应的改进和调整，很有必要了。
    怎样进行组织形式的改进和调整呢？我们的原则是，要有利于无产阶级革命派的大联合，要有利于基层的夺权斗争，要有利于贯彻毛主席的干部政策，实现“三结合”，要有利于“抓革命，促生产”，要有利于各单位斗、批、改任务的完成，要有利于无产阶级专政，要有利于无产阶级革命派成员的思想革命化。在具体做法上，我们决定按单位、按部门把无产阶级革命派组织在统一的革命组织中，然后自下而上地按产业、按系统、按地区，实行条条与块块相结合的大联合。这种大联合的组织形式，是当前斗争形势和任务的需要，是广大革命群众的要求，符合《人民日报》三月一日社论的指示精神，也是上海、贵州地区已经证明行之有效的经验。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”青岛市革命委员会号召全市无产阶级革命派，最坚决地贯彻执行党中央的指示和市革命委员会的决定，最迅速地学习和推广上海、贵州的经验，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，尽快实行按单位按部门的大联合，以便更好地掌握好、使用好已经夺到手的权力，建立和巩固革命的新秩序，更有力地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    实现无产阶级革命派这种新形式的大联合，必须是毛泽东思想挂帅，这是大联合的灵魂。毛主席教导我们：“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”各个革命组织都要坚决遵循毛主席的教导，在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来，联合起来。有的单位较大的革命组织总以为自己人多势众，功劳大，联合应以我为主，要其它革命组织并进自己的组织；也有些革命组织各自为政，不愿联合。这都是山头主义、宗派主义、分散主义的表现，是违背毛泽东思想的，必须坚决纠正。革命不分先后，组织不分大小，怎样对革命有利，就怎样联合。在一些枝节问题上有不同意见，应当服从斗争大方向，统一于毛泽东思想的基础上，决不应因此而影响大联合。在当前文化大革命深入发展的关键时刻，能不能实行按单位按部门的大联合，是衡量一个组织是不是革命的，是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是不是听毛主席的话，以及整风是不是真有成效的试金石，这对每一个革命组织都是一个严峻的考验。
    跨行跨业跨部门的革命组织的成员，都应迅速按照市革命委员会的决定，在本单位本部门参加统一的革命组织。特别是联络总部、分部的负责人，更要带头回到原单位，和广大革命群众一道闹革命。有些同志对在艰苦斗争中建立起来的革命组织有了感情，现在要回单位有点留恋不舍，甚至只从个人或小团体的得失考虑，思想不通。显然，这都是一个“私”字在作怪。毛主席教导我们：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？”我们希望这些同志“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，抛掉各种私心杂念，以革命利益为重，那里需要就到那里去。各单位原有的革命组织对回去的革命同志，要热烈欢迎，坚决支持。有的在群众的同意下还可以吸收他们参加“三结合”的临时权力机构。对某些犯有一定错误的同志，回去以后，也不要歧视他们，要采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的态度，教育和团结他们。我们一定要象毛主席教导的那样：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”目前，各革命组织正在展开活学活用毛主席著作的整风运动，这对实现新的大联合非常有利。青岛市革命委员会要求你们，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动迅速推向一个新高潮，切实搞好整风，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，扫除一切妨碍大联合的山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等非无产阶级思想倾向，按照新的形式整顿队伍，把无产阶级革命派组织在统一的革命组织中。
      “敌人是不会自行消灭的”，“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败”。全市无产阶级革命派的同志们，一定要牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席的这些教导。当我们在新形势下按单位、按部门实行大联合，在组织形式上进行改进和调整的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子，一定会乘机煽阴风，点邪火，挑拨离间，制造是非，进行破坏捣乱。阶级敌人是最怕我们在新形势下更好地实行大联合的，因为我们实行了更广泛更紧密的大联合，他们就更加孤立，他们的日子就更加没法过了。因此，我们要百倍提高警惕，严防阶级敌人的破坏捣乱，随时揭穿他们的一切阴谋诡计和罪恶活动，给他们以坚决有力的打击。
    全市无产阶级革命派同志们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，组成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
