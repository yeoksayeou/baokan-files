Today, this newspaper published a report on the establishment of the Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters in Huairou County, a suburb of Beijing. Establishing such a command headquarters is an extremely important measure to ensure the overall progress of industrial and agricultural production, especially the spring plowing production, and should be widely promoted nationwide. Revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, and local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army at the provincial (municipal), regional, and county levels should immediately take action to establish Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters. It is particularly important to quickly establish county-level command headquarters to lead the imminent spring plowing production work. Whether in areas where power has been seized or in areas where power has not been seized or is in the process of being seized, this should be done.

Currently, the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside of our country is excellent. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres has been significantly enhanced. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," a new situation has emerged in the Cultural Revolution and agricultural production in rural areas. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, together with all laboring masses, with the strong support of local garrison troops and relevant departments, are racing against time, taking decisive action, and launching a magnificent spring plowing production upsurge.

Doing a good job in the current spring plowing production is of great significance for achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production for the entire year. This is a major issue related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," a major issue related to the successful conduct of the Cultural Revolution, and a major issue related to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is not only a production struggle but also a serious political struggle.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for revolution and production in the countryside. They are enthusiastic and full of energy, strongly demanding to do a good job in spring plowing production. Under these circumstances, it is urgently necessary to establish a strong leadership cadre to organize the enthusiasm of the masses. As our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without a powerful leadership cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will not only be unable to last but also be unable to move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." The "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters is the best organizational form for leading spring plowing production. Once this command headquarters is established, it immediately receives the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is a heavy blow to the enemies of the class who plot to sabotage spring plowing production. It is a brilliant creation of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses of our country.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters at the provincial (municipal), regional, and county levels, it is necessary to highlight proletarian politics and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command the spring plowing battle. It is necessary to vigorously promote Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." Through the convening of meetings of cadres at all three levels of the commune, all members of production brigades or production teams, and militia meetings, the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee should be known to every household and deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Spirit becomes matter. Once the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely unite closely, display boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, and shoulder the double burden of revolution and spring plowing with iron shoulders.

The Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters should go deep into the grassroots, mobilize the masses, and help the commune and lower levels to establish a sound leadership cadre. In production brigades and production teams where the leadership cadre is weak or dispersed, a temporary leadership cadre composed of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and militia representatives should be established to be responsible for production work. County-level organs should properly arrange revolutionary work and work, and during the busy spring plowing period, as many cadres as possible should be sent to the front line of spring plowing.

All levels of the Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters should fully utilize the authority of the proletariat, implement high concentration on the basis of proletarian democracy, concentrate manpower and material resources on the front line of production, and focus on the support work of industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial departments for spring plowing production. Focus on key measures to increase production during spring plowing, implement production plans, and command this battle with great political significance. At the same time, it is necessary to be highly vigilant and prevent the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and resolutely smash the counterattacks of the class enemies.

All levels of cadres working in rural areas and every Communist Party member should actively respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, stand up straight, shoulder the burden, and establish new merits in the spring plowing production battle. Comrades who have made mistakes should, as long as they seriously examine and correct their mistakes, firmly guard their posts, and do a good job in spring plowing production, compensate for their mistakes with merit, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will forgive them and support their work. If, because of making mistakes, they are criticized by the masses, fear this and that, are full of resentment, work passively, or even abandon their posts and do not work, that would be adding error to error.

"Many things are urgent." Under the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, all laboring masses, cadres at all levels, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army supporting spring plowing should take immediate action. Under the unified leadership of the Revolutionary Production First-Line Command Headquarters at all levels, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they should strive to achieve a great victory in this year's spring plowing production!

### 建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部

    建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部
    本报今天发表了京郊怀柔县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部成立的消息。成立这种指挥部是当前抓好整个工农业生产，特别是抓好春耕生产的一个极其重要的措施，应当在全国普遍推广。省（市）、地、县各级革命群众组织，革命领导干部和人民解放军当地驻军，都要立即行动起来，建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。尤其要迅速建立县一级的第一线指挥部，以便领导好迫在眉睫的春耕生产工作。无论在已经取得夺权斗争胜利的地区，还是没有夺权或正在夺权的地区，都应当这样做。
    当前，我国农村无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，广大贫下中农和革命干部的社会主义觉悟普遍提高。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表以后，广大农村的无产阶级文化大革命和农业生产出现了新的局面。广大贫下中农和革命干部，团结一切劳动群众，在当地驻军和有关部门的大力支援下，正在争分夺秒，雷厉风行，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮。
    搞好当前的春耕生产对于争取全年农业生产丰收有极大意义。这是关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”的大事，关系到无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行的大事，关系到巩固无产阶级专政的大事。这不仅是一场生产斗争，也是一场严重的政治斗争。
    广大贫下中农是农村抓革命促生产的主力军。他们热情高，干劲足，强烈地要求把春耕生产搞好。在这种情况下，迫切需要建立一个坚强的领导班子，把群众的积极性组织起来。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的：“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，就是领导好春耕生产最好的组织形式。这种指挥部一建立，立即受到广大贫下中农的热烈拥护，而对于阶级敌人破坏春耕生产的阴谋是一个沉重的打击。它是我国无产阶级和广大革命群众的天才创举。
    省（市）、地、县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部建立以后，必须突出无产阶级政治，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指挥春耕战斗。要大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，通过开好公社三级干部会议，生产大队或生产队的全体社员会议以及民兵会议，使毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，家喻户晓，深入人心。精神变物质。广大贫下中农和革命干部掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，就一定会紧紧地团结起来，发挥出冲天的革命干劲，一双铁肩膀挑起革命和春耕两副重担。
    抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，要深入基层，发动群众，帮助公社以下各级健全领导班子。在领导班子软弱或涣散了的生产大队和生产队，要由贫下中农代表、革命干部和民兵代表组成临时的领导班子，负责生产工作。县级机关要妥善安排本单位的革命和工作，在春耕大忙期间，尽可能抽出更多的干部深入春耕第一线。
    各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，要充分运用无产阶级的权威，在无产阶级大民主的基础上实行高度集中，把人力物力集中到生产第一线上去，狠抓工业、交通、财贸等部门对春耕生产的支援工作，狠抓春耕中关键性的增产措施，落实生产计划，指挥好这一场具有重大政治意义的战斗。同时要百倍地提高警惕，防止党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子的阴谋破坏活动，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的反扑。
    各级农村工作的干部，每一个共产党员，都应当积极响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，在春耕生产的战斗中，相信群众，依靠群众，挺起腰杆，挑起重担，建立新的功勋。犯过错误的同志，只要认真检查和决心改正自己的错误，坚守岗位，抓好春耕生产，将功补过，贫下中农就会谅解他们，支持他们工作。如果因为犯了错误，受到群众的批评，怕这怕那，满肚子怨气，消极怠工，甚至撂挑子不干，那就是错上加错。
    “多少事，从来急”。广大贫下中农，一切劳动群众，各级干部，支援春耕的人民解放军指战员，在毛主席和党中央的伟大号召下，紧急行动起来，在各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的统一领导下，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，夺取今年春耕生产的伟大胜利！
