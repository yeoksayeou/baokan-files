The military and civilians of South Vietnam inflicted heavy blows on American air pirates in February, destroying and shooting down a total of 203 enemy aircraft of various types, according to incomplete statistics. This figure does not include the results of the attack on the U.S. air base in Da Nang on February 27.

The report said that during this period, the military and civilians in the central region shot down and destroyed 104 U.S. aircraft. In the southern region, the military and civilians shot down 94 U.S. aircraft in several major battles in February, most of which were helicopters transporting American invading troops for "sweeping" operations.

	Newspaper reports from Saigon: The armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation forces launched fierce artillery attacks on a large U.S. artillery base and the camp of the 9th Infantry Division on March 7 and 8, causing casualties and losses to the U.S. invading forces.

	According to Western news agencies, in the early hours of March 7, the liberation forces fired nearly 300 shells in three waves at a U.S. artillery base located about 9 kilometers south of the demilitarized zone, killing and wounding many U.S. soldiers.

	At 2 a.m. on March 8, the liberation forces again launched an artillery attack on the largest U.S. camp in the Mekong Delta—the camp of the 9th Infantry Division. This attack lasted 15 minutes, killing and wounding many U.S. soldiers.

	At the same time, the liberation forces also attacked a puppet military camp near the U.S. 9th Infantry Division camp, causing severe casualties to about 60 puppet soldiers in the two outposts.

	According to a report from the South Vietnamese liberation communication society, the liberation forces and guerrillas in the provinces of Tay Ninh, Kon Tum, and Bien Hoa in South Vietnam have recently launched continuous and proactive attacks and ambushes against the enemy, annihilating a large number of American and puppet soldiers.

	The guerrillas and local forces in Tay Ninh Province continued to counterattack the large-scale "sweeping" operations launched by American invaders in the northern and northwestern parts of Tay Ninh Province on March 1 and 2, annihilating 113 enemy soldiers and destroying 13 armored vehicles and tanks.

	The liberation forces in Kon Tum Province launched fierce attacks on a U.S. outpost southwest of Kon Tum City over two days, February 21 and 22, almost completely annihilating a U.S. company.

	The guerrillas and local forces in New River District, Bien Hoa Province, launched continuous day and night ambushes and attacks against the enemy's "sweeping" operations in the Xa River Southwest region from February 2 to 16, killing and wounding 359 American invading soldiers, completely annihilating a U.S. company, shooting down three helicopters, and thoroughly smashing the enemy's "sweeping" operation.

	The South Vietnamese liberation forces, which have grown and strengthened in the struggle against the United States, have demonstrated the powerful might of people's war, defeating the seemingly powerful American invaders. The image shows the brave and skilled South Vietnamese liberation army.
