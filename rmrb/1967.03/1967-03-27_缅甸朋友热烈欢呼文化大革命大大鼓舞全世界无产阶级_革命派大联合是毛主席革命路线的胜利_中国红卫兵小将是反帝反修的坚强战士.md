Burmese friends warmly hail the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They point out that this cultural revolution is a world-shaking great revolution, an indispensable great revolutionary movement for the liberation of the world proletariat. Revolutionary people say this revolution is excellent, while all the monsters and demons are in a panic.

A Burmese friend told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: The Chinese proletarian revolutionaries have carried out great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We wholeheartedly support the fearless revolutionary actions of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries.

A group of workers wrote in a letter: The heroic revolutionary struggle waged by the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries has greatly inspired the proletariat and revolutionaries of the world who are engaged in struggle. The Chinese proletarian revolutionaries are indeed good soldiers of Chairman Mao Zedong, and they will forever be a fine example for the revolutionary people of the world.

Some Burmese youths wrote in a letter to Chinese friends: "Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and relies on the masses the most. He is indeed the great leader of the world's revolutionary people."

The letter said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a world-shaking, brilliant, unprecedented, and most magnificent great revolution. The Chinese revolutionary people have set a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the world. This revolution is a fatal blow to American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

They pointed out in the letter that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are in cahoots, doing their utmost to oppose China, slandering and defaming China's Cultural Revolution. However, as Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing."

A Burmese friend recently issued a statement saying that while the Soviet revisionist leadership is betraying Marxism-Leninism and desperately trying to restore capitalism, attempting to reverse the wheel of history, the great helmsman Chairman Mao timely launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This is the second great revolution in history, after the October Revolution, to rouse the world proletariat.

This Burmese friend paid revolutionary greetings to Chairman Mao in the statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon: A group of Burmese youths recently wrote in a letter to Xinhua News Agency reporters: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great encouragement and support to the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism and for national liberation."

The letter expressed the belief that the Chinese people will surely follow Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Burmese youths pointed out in the letter that without a resolute struggle against imperialism and revisionism, it is impossible to build socialism. Revolutionary people must have their own revolutionary theory to oppose imperialism, revisionism, and build socialism, and that is the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought of our time.

The letter enthusiastically praised the Chinese Red Guards, saying that the Red Guards are fighters who are tenaciously struggling against imperialism led by the United States, Khrushchev revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

The letter concluded: "May the Red Guards win greater victories in their struggle. Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Down with American imperialism! The final victory is ours!"

    缅甸朋友热烈欢呼文化大革命大大鼓舞全世界无产阶级
    革命派大联合是毛主席革命路线的胜利
    中国红卫兵小将是反帝反修的坚强战士
    新华社仰光电　缅甸朋友热烈欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们指出，这场文化大革命是震撼世界的大革命，是世界无产阶级的解放所必需的伟大革命运动；革命人民说这场革命好得很，而一切牛鬼蛇神却惊慌失措。
    一位缅甸朋友对新华社记者说：中国无产阶级革命派实行大联合和革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，好得很。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。我们衷心支持中国无产阶级革命派的大无畏的革命行动。
    一群工人在一封信中说：中国无产阶级革命派所进行的英勇的革命斗争，大大鼓舞了正在进行斗争的全世界的无产阶级和革命者。中国的无产阶级革命派不愧为毛泽东主席的好战士，他们永远是世界革命人民的好榜样。
    缅甸一些青年在给中国朋友的信中说：“毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众。他确是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。”
    信里说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是震撼世界的、光辉的、史无前例的和最了不起的大革命。中国革命人民为世界革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。这场革命对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义是致命的打击。
    他们在信中指出，美帝与苏修狼狈为奸，竭力反对中国，诬蔑和诽谤中国的文化大革命。但是正如毛主席教导我们的：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。
    一位缅甸朋友最近发表声明说，正当苏修领导集团背叛马克思列宁主义，拚命实行资本主义复辟，企图扭转历史的车轮的时候，伟大的舵手毛主席及时地在中国发动了无产阶级文化大革命。这是十月革命之后，历史上第二次唤起世界无产阶级的伟大的革命。
    这位缅甸朋友在声明中向毛主席致以革命的敬礼。
    新华社仰光电　一批缅甸青年最近在给新华社记者的信中说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命是对正在为反对帝国主义，争取民族解放而斗争的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲革命人民的巨大鼓舞和支持。”
    信中表示相信，中国人民一定会永远跟着毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    缅甸青年在信中指出，如果不对帝国主义、修正主义进行坚决的斗争，建设社会主义是根本不可能的。革命人民要反对帝国主义、修正主义和建设社会主义，必须有他们自己的革命理论，那就是当代的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。
    信中热情赞扬了中国的红卫兵小将，并且说，红卫兵是在同以美国为首的帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义和各国反动派进行顽强斗争的战士。
    信中最后写道：“愿红卫兵在斗争中赢得更大的胜利。毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万岁！打倒美帝国主义！最后胜利是属于我们的！”
