Tianjin Develops New Type of Oilstone, Ending Dependence on Imports

    Tianjin oilstone factory revolutionary workers resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." After nearly two months of hard work, they successfully developed a resin-graphite filled super-fine grinding oilstone.

    Oilstones are indispensable tools in the printing and dyeing industry. Before engraving patterns on printing cylinders, they must be polished with oilstones. Previously, these oilstones were imported from abroad, consuming a significant amount of foreign exchange. The successful development of this new product by Tianjin oilstone factory marks the end of dependence on imports. This resin-graphite filled super-fine grinding oilstone has recently undergone user testing and has been proven to match the smoothness of imported oilstones. Additionally, it has high strength and excellent wear resistance.

    During the development of this new product, the revolutionary workers of Tianjin oilstone factory actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, criticizing the erroneous idea of "waiting for material conditions." Despite the lack of technical data and poor equipment, they persevered and overcame numerous difficulties. Without a single yuan of state investment and without adding any new equipment, they completed the development of the new product. This fully demonstrates that with the revolutionary forces in charge, Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" can truly be realized, leading to rapid advancements in production technology.

    天津制成新型油石
    从此结束依赖进口的局面
    本报讯　天津市油石厂革命派职工坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，经过近两个月的奋战，试制成功了树脂石墨填充剂超精磨油石。
    油石是印染行业不可缺少的一种磨具。印染行业的印花筒在刻花以前，必须用油石磨光。过去，这种油石一直由国外进口，耗费了不少外汇。天津市油石厂这种新产品试制成功，从此结束了依赖进口的局面。这种树脂石墨填充剂超精磨油石，最近经过用户的磨削鉴定，证明它的光洁度赶上进口油石的水平，同时强度高，耐磨性强。
    天津油石厂革命派职工在试制这一新产品的过程中，活学活用毛主席著作，批判了“坐等物质条件”的错误思想。他们在毫无技术资料、设备简陋的困难情况下，穷干苦干，突破了重重难关，没有要国家一元钱的投资，没有增添一台新设备，就完成了新产品的试制任务。这充分说明，权掌在革命派手里，才能真正实现毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使生产技术得到迅速发展。
