The official publication of the National Liberation Committee of the Congo (Leopoldville), "Revolution," published an article in its January issue titled "Mao Zedong Thought is the Guide for the Revolutionary People of the Congo and the World." The article highly praises "Mao Zedong Thought as the contemporary creative development of Marxism-Leninism that is combined with the reality of the world revolution." The article emphasizes: "In an era where imperialism and colonialism are heading towards destruction and socialism and communism are advancing towards victory, any true revolutionary cannot forget: Mao Zedong Thought is the great revolutionary theory that emerged in this revolutionary era. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the revolutionary theory that combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, but also the revolutionary theory that combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the world revolution."

The article emphasizes: "For all revolutionary people, Mao Zedong Thought is the guide. Comrade Mao Zedong's works are rich in content, profound in analysis, and simple in language, making them understandable to the masses, and they are the only revolutionary theory."

The article states: Mao Zedong Thought not only has great guiding significance for the Chinese people but also for the people of all countries who are engaged in armed struggle against imperialism and reactionary forces. The article continues, "The revolutionary people of the world, based on the specific conditions of their own countries, can correctly apply the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong's teachings, overcome difficulties, resolve internal contradictions among the people, eliminate thoughts that violate revolutionary principles, and formulate the correct political line and strategy for achieving final victory."

When discussing the personal experiences and lessons of the armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) patriots, the article points out that the struggles experienced by the Congolese (Leopoldville) people have confirmed Chairman Mao's famous statement: "The revolutionary road, like all the activities of things in the world, is always tortuous, not straight."

The article states: After summarizing the experience and lessons of three years of struggle, we believe that the correct line is to execute Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on the political and strategic aspects of people's war according to the situation and specific conditions of our country.

The article emphasizes: "Any revolutionary who is aware of their responsibility in the struggle cannot ignore this truth, this truth is the absolute guarantee of our final victory."

The article concludes: Chairman Mao's theories on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, on establishing a broad anti-imperialist united front, on armed struggle and people's war, are precious theories for us in the struggle for national independence and the elimination of all imperialists, reactionaries, and their accomplices.

    刚果（利）全国解放委员会机关刊物发表文章指出
    革命人民必须掌握毛泽东思想
    据新华社十日讯　刚果（利）全国解放委员会机关刊物《革命》一月份刊登了一篇题为《毛泽东思想是刚果和全世界革命人民的指南》的文章。文章高度赞扬“毛泽东思想是当代创造性地发展了的并同世界革命的现实相结合的马克思列宁主义。”文章强调说：“在帝国主义和殖民主义正在走向灭亡，社会主义和共产主义正在走向胜利的时代，任何真正的革命者都不能忘记：毛泽东思想是在这个革命时代出现的伟大的革命理论。毛泽东思想不仅是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的革命理论，而且也是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同世界革命的具体实践相结合的革命理论。”
    文章强调指出：“对于一切要革命的人民来说，毛泽东思想是指南。毛泽东同志的著作内容丰富，分析深刻，语言简朴，为人民群众所理解，是唯一的革命理论。”
    文章说：毛泽东思想不仅对中国人民，而且对正在进行反对帝国主义和反动势力的武装斗争的世界各国人民都具有伟大的指导意义。文章接着说，世界各国革命人民“根据他们本国的具体情况，正确地运用毛泽东的教导这个有力的武器，就能克服困难，解决人民内部矛盾，消除违反革命原则的思想，制订取得最后胜利的正确的政治路线和战略。”
    文章在谈到刚果（利）爱国武装斗争的切身的经验教训时指出，刚果（利）人民所经历的斗争证实了毛主席的这一著名论断：“革命的道路，同世界上一切事物活动的道路一样，总是曲折的，不是笔直的。”
    文章说，在总结了三年斗争的经验教训之后，我们认为，正确的路线是根据我国的形势和具体条件，去执行毛泽东同志关于人民战争的政治上和战略上的教导。
    文章强调说：“任何意识到了自己的斗争责任的革命者都不能不重视这个真理，这个真理是我们取得最后胜利的绝对保证。”
    文章最后说：毛主席的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，关于建立广泛的反帝统一战线，关于武装斗争和人民战争等学说，对我们来说，是争取民族独立，消灭一切帝国主义、反动派以及他们的同伙的斗争中的宝贵理论。
