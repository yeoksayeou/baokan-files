Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the issue of how to handle cadre problems in the struggle for power between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a major and key issue.

Currently, to help the revolutionary masses of the proletariat correct their understanding, unify their thinking, and properly handle cadre issues in the struggle for power, we must strictly follow the thought of Mao Zedong and the cadre policies that Mao Zedong has consistently advocated. We must establish a genuine "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ with leadership capabilities. Today, we have selected a set of songs composed to the quotations of Chairman Mao for everyone to sing.

After the Political Line is Determined (Song)
	Composed to the Quotations of Chairman Mao
		(Created by the "Endure the Storm" Combat Group of the General Political Department's Artistic Troupe)

    在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争中，怎样对待干部问题，是一个重大问题，关键问题。
    当前，为了帮助无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中端正认识，统一思想，正确地对待干部，不折不扣地按照毛泽东思想，按照毛主席一贯提倡的党的干部政策办事，以建立一个真正有领导能力的“三结合”的临时权力机构，今天我们选登了一组为毛主席语录谱写的歌曲，供大家传唱。　——编者
