A thunderous spring thunder echoes through the sky,
The joyous news of Chairman Mao reaches the farm,
The PLA actively propagates,
Every member of the commune is full of fighting spirit.

The PLA comrades come to the countryside,
Bringing a wonderful scene,
Revolution and production both achieve victory,
Military-civilian unity is as strong as steel.

The narcissus blooms, roots intertwined,
Military and civilians are one family,
By the fields, they study the sayings together,
Following Chairman Mao to make revolution.

The PLA comrades enter the deep mountains,
People gain spirit, horses gain saddles,
The spring plowing battle knows no fatigue,
Striving every minute to rush forward.

    解放军是咱好榜样〔组画〕春雷一声震天响，毛主席喜信到农庄，解放军积极来宣传，社员个个斗志昂。解放军同志下了乡，带来一派好风光，革命、生产双胜利，军民团结坚如钢。水仙花开根连根，军民团结一家人，田头并肩学语录，跟着毛主席闹革命。解放军同志进深山，人添精神马添鞍，春耕激战不知累，争分夺秒赶向前。
