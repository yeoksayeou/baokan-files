Class Struggle Has Not Been Extinguished

A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will not accept defeat after losing their power. They will inevitably launch desperate counterattacks in various ways.

In 1952, I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and went to the battlefield in Korea. In one battle to seize a strategic high point, our company, with the support of a brother unit, retook the position from the enemy. As soon as we had set up our defenses, the enemy regrouped their forces and counterattacked us that very night. At the time, we made an emergency mobilization, displaying a spirit of bravery and fearlessness in battle, and after five days and nights of intense fighting, we finally repelled the enemy's more than ten counterattacks and secured the position.

I tell this story to illustrate that class struggle on the battlefield is like this, and in the great decisive battle of the Cultural Revolution—the struggle for power—it is the same. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat have won the struggle for power, but the bourgeoisie still exists, and class struggle has not been extinguished. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will not accept their own defeat. Like the enemy on the Korean battlefield, they will inevitably launch desperate counterattacks in various ways. Therefore, we must not think that seizing power means everything is settled. If we neglect the consolidation of political power and neglect the future struggle for power and counter-power, it will be very dangerous.

We have expended great effort in the struggle for power to achieve the current victory. However, in the future, we will have to expend even greater effort to consolidate this political power. We must not think that we have already won and then rush to hold "victory celebrations," relaxing our vigilance against the class enemy. We must know that they are always longing for the "paradise" they have lost. Some are forming cliques and accumulating strength, preparing to rise again; others are disguising themselves, sharpening their wits, trying to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, fish in troubled waters, and carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. We must resolutely resist and smash the various conspiracies of the class enemy and safeguard the fruits of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

### 阶级斗争没有熄灭

    阶级斗争没有熄灭
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在失去权力以后，绝不会甘心失败，他们必然要用各种方式进行垂死的反扑。
    一九五二年，我参加了中国人民志愿军，来到了朝鲜战场上。在一次争夺阵地的战斗中，我们连在兄弟单位的配合下，从敌人手里夺回一个战略制高点。我们刚刚布好阵脚，敌人连夜又重整火力向我们反扑。当时，我们作了紧急动员，发扬了勇敢战斗不怕牺牲的精神，经过五天五夜的激烈战斗，终于打退了敌人十几次反扑，巩固了阵地。
    我讲这个故事，是想说明：阶级斗争在战场上是这样，在无产阶级文化大革命的大决战——夺权斗争中，情形也是这样。无产阶级革命派取得了夺权斗争的胜利，但是资产阶级依然存在，阶级斗争没有熄灭。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派绝不会甘心自己的失败，他们就象朝鲜战场上的敌人那样，必然要用各种方式进行垂死的反扑。所以，我们绝不能以为夺了权就万事大吉了。如果忽视了政权的巩固，忽视了今后掌权和反掌权的斗争，那是十分危险的。
    我们在夺权斗争中花了很大的力气，才取得了目前的胜利。但是今后在巩固这个政权中将要花更大的力气，决不能以为已经取得胜利，而忙于开“庆功会”，放松了对阶级敌人的警惕。要知道，他们无时不在怀念失去了的“天堂”，有的正在结党营私，“积蓄力量”，准备东山再起；有的却在乔装打扮，削尖脑袋，企图钻进革命派内部，混水摸鱼，实行反革命复辟。我们必须坚决抵制和粉碎阶级敌人的种种阴谋活动，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的胜利果实。
