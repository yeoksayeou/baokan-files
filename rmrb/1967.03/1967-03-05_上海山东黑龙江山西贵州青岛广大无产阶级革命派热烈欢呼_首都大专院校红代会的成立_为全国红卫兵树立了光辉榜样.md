The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanghai, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Qingdao warmly celebrate the establishment of the Red Guards Representative Congress of colleges and universities in the capital. This sets a brilliant example for the Red Guards nationwide.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on March 4, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the Red Guards in Shanghai, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Qingdao, upon hearing the joyous news of the establishment of the Red Guards Representative Congress of colleges and universities in the capital, extended their warmest congratulations to the Red Guards in the capital. They enthusiastically hailed the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in the unity, solidarity, and rallying of the Red Guards in the capital based on the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They hailed it as a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in various places enthusiastically sang the praises of the Red Guards for their immortal achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They praised them for firmly grasping the great direction of the unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat at the critical moment of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The Red Guards in various places most resolutely pledged to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the proletariat, and to unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will establish new merits.

The news reached Shanghai, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses extended their warmest congratulations to the Red Guards in the capital, saluting them with the revolutionary greetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! A worker comrade from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters excitedly said: The unity, solidarity, and rallying of the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities is a major event of great significance in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards in the capital are indeed the red successors of our great leader Chairman Mao. In the Cultural Revolution, they were the first to go from the schools to society, to thoroughly smash the Four Olds and establish the Four News, spreading the revolutionary sparks throughout the country, and striking a heavy blow against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line. They have struck down all the ghosts and snakes, achieving immortal merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities, following the course set by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, have achieved unity, setting a brilliant example for the Red Guards nationwide. They will certainly create greater merits in the Cultural Revolution. They are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. They are indeed the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries who harbor the delusion of peaceful evolution in our young generation will never achieve their foolish dreams! The young comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary United Front Preparatory Committee, upon hearing the joyous news of the establishment of the Red Guards Representative Congress in the capital, decided to take the revolutionary comrades in the capital as their example, to achieve unity among the Red Guards in Shanghai, and to strive for the unity of the Red Guards nationwide based on Mao Zedong Thought. They said, sailing the great seas relies on the helmsman. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out a new course for us. We must forever study and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever be the little red soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao. The young comrades of the Shanghai Jiaotong University Red Guards excitedly said, the unity, solidarity, and rallying of the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is a major event of great historical significance that pushes the Red Guards movement to a broader, deeper, and higher stage. We must, while seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, seize the power of the selfish character in our own minds, forever be daring and bold revolutionary pioneers, carry the proletarian revolution in China to the end, and carry the proletarian revolution in the world to the end!

The news reached Shandong, and the Red Guards enthusiastically held meetings for study and discussion, warmly hailing another great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The young comrades of the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters unanimously agreed at a meeting that the establishment of the Red Guards Representative Congress in the capital marks the development of the Red Guards movement to a new level as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country enters a new stage. It powerfully proves that the Red Guards, discovered, supported, and nurtured by our great leader Chairman Mao, are a new thing with strong vitality. It reflects the voice of the broad masses of Red Guards. We warmly hail and firmly support it. They said, the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities can unite because they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break private interests and establish public interests, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. We must learn from the Red Guards in the capital and build our ranks into a mighty revolutionary army with strong fighting spirit and vitality.

The young comrades of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute and other colleges and universities, who have fought bravely and established merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, excitedly said upon hearing the news: The unity and solidarity of the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities based on Mao Zedong Thought is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary leftists and strikes a heavy blow against the class enemies and conservative forces. We are all proud and inspired by the new merits established by our comrades in the capital in the Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, are exactly following Chairman Mao's teaching. At the critical moment of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they resolutely carry out the unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, laying the foundation for the victory of the struggle to seize power. The young comrades of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute and other schools also expressed that they would be both pioneers in transforming the objective world and models in transforming the subjective world. They would definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works better, while seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, resolutely seize the power of the selfish character in their own minds, open the door for rectification, and devote themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the Red Guards in Shanxi warmly praised the establishment of the Red Guards Representative Congress in the capital's colleges and universities as an important sign and new milestone in the development of the Red Guards movement. The young comrades of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Corps enthusiastically congratulated the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities for achieving unity, solidarity, and rallying under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, the revolutionary unity of the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities sets a brilliant example for revolutionary young comrades nationwide. We learn from them and pay tribute to them. We have grown up and become strong under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you.... The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." We will forever be loyal to the supreme commander Chairman Mao, follow his teachings, and under his guidance, firmly and unshakably unite with the Red Guards nationwide and with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide. We will resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, climb the limitless peaks of communism, and let the brilliant and boundless light of the great Mao Zedong Thought shine over all of China and the world.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Guiyang region said: The joyous news of the establishment of the Red Guards Representative Congress in the capital once again shows that the heroic Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to revolutionize, dare to rebel, and play a vanguard role in the Cultural Revolution, achieving immortal merits, and are indeed the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The young comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Headquarters of Guiyang's colleges and universities excitedly reviewed their struggle alongside the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Cultural Revolution, and deeply felt the importance of revolutionary unity. They expressed: We must learn from the Red Guards comrades in the capital to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, both regarding ourselves as a force for the revolution and as an object of the revolution, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly holding the red political power, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! The young comrades of the Red Guards Ninth of May Combat Team of Guizhou Institute of Technology excitedly said: The revolutionary unity of the Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities is excellent and will certainly promote the revolutionary unity of the Red Guards nationwide and the unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, thoroughly defeating the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" The young comrades of the Red Guards Liaison Headquarters of Qingdao's colleges and universities held a meeting. They excitedly said: The first Red Guards to appear on the eastern horizon are the great capital, and today, the first great unity and rallying of the Red Guards also appear in our beloved great capital Beijing. This is Chairman Mao's old man's greatest support for us Red Guards. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. We must unite, combine, and consolidate under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought! The young comrades of the East is Red Revolutionary Combat Team of Qingdao Medical College linked their struggle in Qingdao and said: Unity is strength, and only unity can bring victory! The more the enemy fears our unity, the more we must achieve great unity!
