Economic stagnation, declining production, reduced investment, and a significant increase in unemployment have become the most pressing issues for the major capitalist countries in Western Europe today.

West Germany: The "Overproduction" Crisis is Snowballing

West Germany, once hailed as the "economic miracle" of the capitalist world after the war, has seen its heyday pass. Since last October, the German economy has begun to deteriorate. The domestic market is increasingly unable to absorb the growing number of domestic products. Key industries such as automobiles, steel, and coal mining have all started to cut production.

The automotive industry has always been a crucial factor in the rise and fall of Germany's overall economy. Since last October, Germany's automotive sales have plummeted. By the beginning of this year, due to excessive inventory, more than 360,000 cars were unsold, leading to a significant reduction in production. This cutback has made it even harder for the already "overproduced" steel industry to find a market for its products. The reduction in steel production has further exacerbated the crisis in the coal mining industry. Meanwhile, industries such as electricity and rubber have also been affected. Thus, Germany's "overproduction" crisis has spread rapidly across various industrial sectors like a snowball.

United Kingdom: A Year of Economic Hardship After Three Years of Stagnation

The economic outlook for the United Kingdom in 1967 is equally bleak. British industrial production has been stagnant for three years. Last year, steel production decreased by 10%, the lowest level in three years. Automobile production decreased by 30%, the lowest point since 1963.

The long-term stagnation of the British economy is closely linked to the Labour government's policy of freezing wages, reducing domestic consumption, and minimizing imports to protect the pound. However, this policy has done nothing to improve Britain's weak international trade and balance of payments position. Currently, the pound remains in a precarious state. Western media generally predict that 1967 will be another tough year for the British economy and the pound.

France: Hit Hard by the Shrinking Markets in Europe and America

After experiencing a decline in 1964-1965, France's economy showed some signs of recovery last year. However, signs of weakness began to appear in the latter half of the year. Last year's steel production remained at the 1965 level, while coal production decreased by 2%. Housing construction even declined by 9%. The number of unemployed people in the country increased by 7% over the year.

However, what concerns French business owners the most is the severe threat posed by the shrinking markets in West Germany, the UK, and the US this year. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the worsening economic situation in West Germany and the UK has heavily impacted France's exports, resulting in a significant trade deficit in the last three months and a loss of $58 million in gold and foreign exchange reserves.

Other Western European countries, such as Belgium, Austria, Spain, and the Netherlands, are also facing economic contraction and stagnant market conditions.

The severe "overproduction" crisis that has simultaneously struck Western European countries is unprecedented in the post-war era. Given that this is happening at a time when the U.S. economy is dim and the dollar and pound are in jeopardy, it will undoubtedly bring about extremely serious political and economic consequences for the capitalist world.

### 西欧各国经济面临严重生产“过剩”危机

    西欧各国经济面临严重生产“过剩”危机
    本报讯　经济停滞、生产下降、投资减少、失业人数大量增加、市场问题无法解决，已成了西欧主要资本主义国家今天面临的最头痛的问题。
    西德：生产“过剩”危机象滚雪球一样
    号称战后资本主义世界经济不断“繁荣”的“奇迹”的西德，它的好时光已经过去了。从去年十月起，西德经济开始恶化。国内市场越来越无法消纳日益增加的本国产品。汽车、钢铁、采煤等重要工业部门都纷纷减产。
    汽车工业一向是关系西德整个经济盛衰的一个重要环节。西德的汽车工业从去年十月起，销售量大减。今年年初，由于积压而卖不出去的汽车，超过三十六万辆，不得不开始大幅度减产。它的减产，使本来就“生产过剩”的钢铁工业更加难以为自己的产品找到出路。钢铁工业的减产接着又加重了采煤工业的危机。与此同时，电气、橡胶等工业也受到波及。这样，西德的生产“过剩”危机，就象滚雪球一样，很快在各个工业部门蔓延开来。
    英国：三年停滞以后又逢一个凶年
    英国一九六七年的经济前景同样是一片黑暗。英国的工业生产已有三年停滞不前。去年，英国钢产量下降了百分之十，是三年来最低的水平。汽车产量下降了百分之三十，是一九六三年以来的最低点。
    英国经济的长期停滞，是同工党政府为保护英镑而采取的冻结工资、压缩国内消费、竭力减少进口等一系列紧缩政策分不开的。但是这个政策实施的结果，丝毫也没有能改善英国虚弱的国际贸易和收支地位。目前英镑仍然处在岌岌可危状态。西方报刊普遍预料，一九六七年仍然是英国经济和英镑将经受严峻考验的一个凶年。
    法国：遭到欧美市场萎缩的沉重打击
    法国的经济经历了一九六四——一九六五年的下降之后，去年稍稍有了起色。但是，去年下半年，已出现了虚弱的迹象。去年的钢产量基本上停留在一九六五年的水平。煤产量下降百分之二。房屋建筑甚至下降了百分之九。全国失业人数一年中增加了百分之七。
    但是，最使法国企业主担心的还是今年西德、英国和美国市场萎缩对法国的严重威胁。从去年第四季起，西德和英国经济情况的恶化，已沉重打击了法国的出口，使它在最后三个月出现了巨大的国际收支赤字，损失了五千八百万美元的黄金外汇储备。
    西欧其他一些国家，象比利时、奥地利、西班牙和荷兰也都陷入了经济萎缩、市场销路呆滞的困难境地。
    西欧各国的经济这样普遍地、不约而同地出现严重的生产“过剩”，这在战后还是第一次。由于这是发生在美国经济前景黯淡，而美元、英镑又岌岌可危的时刻，它必然会为资本主义世界带来极严重的政治和经济后果。
