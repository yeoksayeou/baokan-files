The people of China resolutely support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating American imperialism

Comrade Chen Yi and others attended the rally. Guo Moruo spoke, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' new war "escalation" in Vietnam and their new "peace talks" trick, as well as the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionists. Nguyen Minh Hoang and Le Cong Chi spoke, expressing the Vietnamese people's firm resolve in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 19th, the revolutionary masses of the capital, who are advancing in victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, together with friends from the five continents in Beijing, held a grand rally to angrily condemn the U.S. imperialists' new war "escalation" in Vietnam and their new "peace talks" trick, and to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

Today marks the 17th anniversary of the Vietnamese people's national anti-U.S. struggle day. The revolutionary masses of the capital pointed out at today's rally that the U.S. imperialists' intensified war "escalation" in Vietnam proves that their nature of aggression will never change, and they can only face more powerful counterattacks from the Vietnamese people. The rally solemnly declared that the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end and thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors.

Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Peng Shaohui, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, and responsible persons from relevant departments, representatives of the Red Guards of the capital, and representatives of workers and peasants of the capital attended the rally. Also present were Nguyen Minh Hoang, acting head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Le Cong Chi, acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing.

Friends from various countries on the five continents in Beijing also attended the rally. Among them were: Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association Chahardoh, Australian friend Johnson, New Zealand friends Mrs. Smith, Ayling, and Casey, Japanese friend Nishizono Teru, American Black leader Robert F. Williams, Sudanese friend Kair, representative of the National Liberation League of Malaya to China Sharmah, assistant to the representative abroad of the Patriotic Front of Thailand Mongkhon Nanasong, Lao friend Madame Koun, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Beijing Galib, American friend Li Dunbai, and Indonesian friend Willy.

The rally was held at the China Peaceful Reunification Promotion Association Hall. The entrance hall was adorned with the national flags of the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. On the stage were portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

The rally began with everyone reciting Chairman Mao's quotation: "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties and press on. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All monsters will be annihilated."

Liao Chengzhi delivered the opening speech. He said that the people of various circles in the capital, under the personal leadership of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, are holding this rally as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances from victory to greater victory. We fully support the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 5, resolutely support the recent statements issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in their determination to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end. The U.S. imperialists' intensified war "escalation" in Vietnam will only meet with more powerful counterattacks from the Vietnamese people and suffer more severe defeats. The Chinese people, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are ready to make the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people in carrying the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to final victory.

Guo Moruo made a lengthy speech at the rally (full text on page 3), in which he warmly praised the Vietnamese people's heroic anti-U.S. struggle over the past 17 years and their great victories, and strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' recent frenzied intensification of their aggressive war against Vietnam.

Guo Moruo said that our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making our people more revolutionary, more spirited, and more determined to fight. This will enable us to provide greater support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Chinese people are closely watching the developments in Vietnam. The Chinese people have made up their minds to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers in thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors.

Acting Head Nguyen Minh Hoang said in his speech (full text on page 3) that no matter how the U.S. imperialists threaten and deceive, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam will concentrate all their efforts to defeat them and resolutely realize their sacred wish to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country. The victories of the Vietnamese people have proven the contemporary truth that will never be overturned: a nation, no matter how small, will have sufficient strength to smash any imperialist plots and acts of aggression if it has the correct political line, wages a people's war, and unites to fight for national independence and the reunification of the country.

Nguyen Minh Hoang said that the Chinese people, with a high sense of internationalism, have provided tremendous and effective assistance to the people of South Vietnam, regardless of the sacrifices. The Vietnamese people have highly appreciated this invaluable support.

Acting Charge d'Affaires Le Cong Chi, in his speech (full text on page 3), strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' recent adoption of more serious war "escalation," committing many new crimes against the Vietnamese people.

He said that at present, the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is entering a tense and fierce stage. Our people throughout the country are resolutely responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call on July 17, 1966, uniting as one, bravely advancing, defending the North, liberating the South, and ultimately reunifying the country, defeating the head of modern imperialism, U.S. imperialism's aggression.

Le Cong Chi said that the seven hundred million Chinese brothers, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a magnificent manner, and have always stood firmly with the Vietnamese people, sincerely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation in both spirit and material. The Chinese brothers are always the close comrades-in-arms of the Vietnamese people.

Representatives of the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and representatives of workers and peasants of the capital spoke at the rally. They warmly congratulated the Vietnamese people on their brilliant victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression and strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' expanded aggression against Vietnam and the Soviet revisionist leadership's role as the U.S. imperialists' accomplices. They declared that the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people and fight side by side with the Vietnamese brothers to victory. They said:

"Under the leadership of our supreme commander Chairman Mao, all Red Guards will certainly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, full of revolutionary daring, will smash the imperialists' and all reactionaries' plots to restore capitalism in China. The Red Guards of China are determined to be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people. As long as the Vietnamese people need us, and as soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the battlefield in Vietnam and fight side by side with the Vietnamese people, drive out the U.S. imperialists, and trample them underfoot! Make them never rise again!"

"Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has solemnly declared: 'We have made all preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers in carrying the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end.' All the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have made up their minds not to be afraid of any sacrifices. As long as the interests of the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people require it, and as soon as our great leader Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately set out and fight side by side with our Vietnamese brothers, thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors."

"The Chinese workers, who are loyal to proletarian internationalism, have always regarded the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle and have always supported the Vietnamese brothers in practical actions from all aspects. Now, the Chinese workers are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call to 'grasp revolution, promote production,' leading production with revolution, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and promoting a leap in industrial production. This will greatly enhance the strength to support Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. The Chinese workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people."

"We are commune members armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We will always stand with the heroic Vietnamese people. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'grasp revolution, promote production,' mobilizing all forces to launch a spring production campaign. We will produce more and support the Vietnamese people in carrying the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to final victory."

During their speeches, the crowd repeatedly shouted: "Strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' new military blackmail against Vietnam! Strongly condemn the treacherous activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Resolutely support the Vietnamese brothers in fighting U.S. aggression to the end! Long live the combat unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples! Long live the great unity of the people of the world! Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh! Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The rally read out the "Telegram from the Rally of the People of Various Circles of the Capital in Support of the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression for National Salvation."

The rally ended with everyone singing the "Internationale." (with pictures)
