An old revolutionary from Spain said on February 28 in Algiers to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that the revolutionary masses in Spain have recognized Chairman Mao as the great leader of the world proletariat in contemporary times, and that Mao Zedong Thought is the new peak of Marxism-Leninism.

This old revolutionary has been fighting for the liberation of the Spanish people for over twenty years. He said that progressive workers, students, and other laboring people in Spain are diligently studying the works of Mao Zedong, using Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle for their revolutionary work. Many young revolutionaries, despite the risks and the persecution by Franco's police, are reading and discussing the works of Mao Zedong.

He said, "The works of Chairman Mao are the essence of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's works are extremely profound and are an everlasting source of revolution. At the same time, they are clear and straightforward, making them easily accessible to the laboring masses." This old revolutionary fighter also pointed out, "Chairman Mao not only understands the feelings of the Chinese people but also the feelings of the oppressed peoples of the world. He is the unique great leader of the revolutionary peoples of the world. He belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to us, the Spanish people."

He continued, "Chairman Mao has praised the anti-fascist people's army of the Spanish proletariat in his works. The dictator Franco has been in power for nearly thirty years, but the Spanish people have never stopped fighting. The Spanish people have a revolutionary tradition and experience. I firmly believe that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Spanish people will organize, take up arms, and fight to achieve victory, which is not far off."

This Spanish revolutionary, when talking about the Soviet revisionist leadership, said, "The CPSU leadership, starting from Khrushchev, has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and become revisionist."

This old revolutionary, with great enthusiasm, said, "Now, China led by Mao Zedong is the pillar and fortress of the world revolution. We are closely watching the profoundly meaningful development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China." He repeatedly said, "We have great trust in the Communist Party of China and in Mao Zedong Thought."

When parting, this Spanish revolutionary, with great emotion, tightly grasped the reporter's hand and said, "Please convey my heartfelt greetings to Chairman Mao Zedong, wishing him good health and longevity."

    西班牙老革命战士赞颂毛主席是世界无产阶级的伟大领袖 
    西班牙革命者把毛泽东思想作为行动纲领
    据新华社阿尔及尔电  西班牙的一位老革命者二月二十八日在阿尔及尔对新华社记者说，西班牙的革命群众认定毛主席是当代世界无产阶级的伟大领袖，毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的新的高峰。
    这位老革命者为着西班牙人民的解放事业，已经斗争了二十多年。他说，西班牙的进步工人、学生和其他劳动人民正在刻苦地学习毛泽东著作，把毛泽东思想作为行动纲领，用来指导自己的革命工作。许多革命青年冒着风险，不怕佛朗哥的警察迫害，阅读和讨论毛泽东著作。
    他说，毛主席著作是马克思列宁主义的精髓。毛主席的著作非常深刻，是永不枯竭的革命泉源。他的著作同时又非常清楚、通俗，最容易为劳动群众所接受。这位老革命战士还指出：“毛主席不但最了解中国人民的感情，而且最了解世界被压迫人民的感情。他是世界革命人民的独一无二的伟大领袖，他不仅属于中国人民，也属于我们西班牙人民。”
    他接着说：“毛主席在他的著作中曾经赞扬过西班牙无产阶级的反法西斯的人民军队。独裁者佛朗哥上台将近三十年了，西班牙人民从来没有间断过斗争。西班牙人民是有着革命传统和革命经验的人民。我深信不疑，在毛泽东思想的指引下，西班牙人民组织起来，拿起武器，去进行斗争，夺取胜利的时刻已经不远了。”
    这位西班牙革命者在谈到苏联修正主义领导集团时说：“苏共领导，从赫鲁晓夫起，就已经背叛了马克思列宁主义，变成了修正主义。”
    这位老革命者最后热情洋溢地说：“现在，毛泽东领导的中国是世界革命的支柱，是世界革命的堡垒。我们密切地注视着意义极为深刻的中国文化大革命的发展。”他接连地重复说：“我们非常信赖中国共产党，非常信赖毛泽东思想。”
    在分别的时候，这位西班牙革命者激动地紧紧握住记者的手说：“请一定把我的衷心的问候转达给毛泽东主席，祝他十分健康，祝他长寿。”
