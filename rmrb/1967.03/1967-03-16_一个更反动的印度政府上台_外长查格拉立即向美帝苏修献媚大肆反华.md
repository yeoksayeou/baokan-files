A more reactionary Indian government has come to power following the fourth general election. This government is even more subservient to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. This will further disillusion the Indian people, prompting them to prepare for larger-scale struggles to completely overthrow the rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie.

In this election, the Congress Party, which suffered unprecedented setbacks, has hastily formed a central government. After several days of intense political bargaining, the Congress Party leaders decided to continue with Indira Gandhi, who is colluding with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, as Prime Minister. They also created the position of Deputy Prime Minister, which was given to the notorious pro-American politician Desai, who also serves as the Finance Minister. The ministers of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs, and Defense remain unchanged. Indira Gandhi also recruited two feudal princes into her government.

Such a government can only be a more reactionary government that serves the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Indian tycoons like Birlas, who have ties with both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, were ecstatic in January, predicting that the new cabinet would be a "better cabinet." After the new government's list was announced, the U.S. imperialist propaganda machine, the United Press International, immediately praised the government, saying it would allow Indian monopolies to develop further. The Soviet mouthpiece Tass on the 12th praised Indira Gandhi's so-called "non-alignment and building a democratic socialist path."

In this election, the Congress Party lost control in eight states, which make up half of the country, ending its monopoly over local governments nationwide. This shows that the tool of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, which has been effective for twenty years, has failed under the waves of people's resistance. However, the Indian reactionary forces have used other tools to maintain their dictatorship, further cruelly exploiting and oppressing the Indian people. The Swatantra Party, representing comprador bourgeoisie forces, became the second-largest party and controlled Orissa; the Jan Sangh, representing feudal sectarian forces, became the third-largest party and controlled the capital Delhi. More than a hundred feudal princes were elected as members of parliament. Several states may have local kings as their chief ministers.

The Communist Party of India and other parties won the elections in Kerala and formed a state government. People remember that the Communist Party of India had organized a state government after the second general election in 1957. However, the reform measures it proposed within the bourgeois constitutional framework were obstructed by reactionary forces and could not be implemented. This state government, which had been in power for only twenty-eight months, was dissolved by order of the Indian central government.

This election shows that reactionary rulers often discard the false "democracy" used to deceive the people when class struggles intensify domestically. Recently, the people of Rajasthan strongly opposed the governor's order for the Congress Party to forcibly form a state government, which was met with bloody suppression by the reactionary authorities. On the 13th, at the first meeting of the new Indian cabinet, it was decided to have the president forcibly "take over" Rajasthan.

Indian working-class traitor Dange once again exposed his ugly face after this election. He recently advocated in Indian bourgeois newspapers that the results of this election are a "victory of the left." He shamelessly spread revisionist fallacies, serving the reactionary ruling forces, and advocated that some state governments not controlled by the Congress Party would "harmoniously work" with the central government controlled by the Congress Party to "quickly improve the national situation."

New Delhi, March 15 (Xinhua) - The new Indian government, on the day after it took office, had its Foreign Minister Chagla make anti-China remarks to please its backers, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Chagla on the 14th told reporters from the Indian Press Trust that China is maintaining a "belligerent and threatening posture" towards India. It is known that the Indian government is still occupying a large portion of Chinese territory, but Chagla continued to slander China for occupying "Indian territory."

While Chagla vigorously praised the "non-proliferation treaty" draft concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, he launched a vicious attack on China for developing nuclear weapons for self-defense.

On the same day Chagla made these remarks, the U.S. imperialists granted the Indian government a loan equivalent to $4 million. At the same time, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department expressed satisfaction with the new Indian government. He said, "We have closely cooperated with Mrs. Gandhi, just as we have cooperated with her predecessors, and we expect to continue this cooperation."

### 一个更反动的印度政府上台  外长查格拉立即向美帝苏修献媚大肆反华

    一个更反动的印度政府上台
    外长查格拉立即向美帝苏修献媚大肆反华
    据新华社十五日讯  本社记者报道：印度在第四届大选以后组成了进一步投靠美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的更加反动的政府。这将进一步促使印度人民丢掉一切幻想，准备开展更大规模的斗争，直到彻底推翻大地主大资产阶级的统治。
    在这届大选中遭到空前挫折的国大党所勉强拼凑的中央政府，在十三日宣布就职。国大党的头目们经过好几天紧张的政治交易以后，决定继续由勾结美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的英迪拉·甘地担任总理，同时特地增设了副总理的职位，由臭名远扬的老牌亲美政客德赛担任，他还兼任财政部长。外交、内政、国防部长不变。英迪拉·甘地还把两名封建王公贵族搜罗到她的政府中去。
    这样一个政府，只能是一个更加忠实地为大地主大资产阶级的利益效劳的反动政府。同美帝苏修都有勾结的印度大财阀比拉今年一月间就已经兴高采烈地预料，新的内阁在他看来一定是“更好的内阁”。当新政府的名单公布以后，美帝国主义的宣传机器合众国际社马上称赞这样一个政府将使印度垄断资本得到更大的发展。苏联的喉舌塔斯社十二日则宣扬英迪拉·甘地所标榜的所谓“不结盟和建设民主社会主义的道路”。
    在这次大选中，印度国大党在占全国半数的八个邦内失去了控制，从此结束了一党垄断全国地方政权的局面。这说明在人民反抗的怒潮冲击下，印度大地主大资产阶级二十年来得心应手的工具，已经失灵。但是，印度反动势力却利用它的另外一些工具来维持它的专政，进一步残酷剥削和压迫印度人民。代表买办资产阶级势力的自由党成了第二大党，并控制了奥里萨邦；代表封建教派势力的人民同盟成了第三大党，并控制了首都德里。在大选中当选为议员的封建王公贵族竟达一百多人。有几个邦内的土皇帝可能当上邦首席部长。
    印度共产党和其它一些政党在喀拉拉邦竞选获胜而组成邦政府。人们记得，印度共产党曾经在一九五七年举行的第二届大选后组织过邦政府。但是，它在资产阶级宪法范围内提出的一些改良措施，都受到反动势力的阻挠而无法实现。这个邦政府仅仅执政了二十八个月，就被印度中央政府下令解散了。
    这次大选表明，反动统治者在国内阶级斗争激化时，常常把欺骗人民的假“民主”抛到九霄云外。拉贾斯坦邦人民最近强烈反对邦长下令由国大党强行组织邦政府，受到反动当局的血腥镇压。十三日在印度新内阁的第一次会议上就作出决定，干脆由总统强行“接管”拉贾斯坦邦。
    印度工人阶级的可耻叛徒丹吉在这次大选后再一次暴露了他的丑恶面目。他最近在印度资产阶级报刊上大肆宣扬这届大选的结果是什么“左派的胜利”。他厚颜无耻地散布修正主义谬论，替反动统治势力效劳，鼓吹什么非国大党执政的一些邦政府同国大党的中央政府“和谐地工作”，以“迅速改进全国的情况”。
    新华社十五日讯　新德里消息：印度新政府在上台的第二天，就由它的外交部长查格拉出面发表反华谬论，来讨好它的后台老板美帝国主义和苏联修正主义。
    查格拉十四日对印度报业托辣斯记者发表谈话，横蛮无理地攻击中国对印度“保持着”“好战和威胁性的姿态”。众所周知，印度政府现在还侵占着中国的大片领土，但是查格拉却继续诬蔑中国霸占“印度的领土”。
    查格拉一面竭力吹捧美帝和苏修合谋搞出的“不扩散核武器条约”草案，一面对中国为了自卫而发展核武器大肆进行攻击。
    就在查格拉发表这次讲话的同一天，美帝国主义赏给印度政府相当于四千万美元的贷款。同时，美国国务院发言人对印度新政府表示满意。他说：“我们同甘地夫人曾经密切合作过，就象我们同她的前任者合作过一样，我们期望继续合作下去。”
