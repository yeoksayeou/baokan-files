	Resolutely Stand on the Side of the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat
	Former Party Secretary of Shanghai Foodstuffs Company, Wang Kun

	For a period, I did not understand the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Half a year of intense and complex class struggle has awakened me, making me realize that without this Proletarian Cultural Revolution, "it would not take long, a few years or a decade at the least, a few decades at most, before an inevitable nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration would occur. The Marxist-Leninist Party would definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China would change color."

	Without thoroughly criticizing the capitalist reactionary line, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao cannot be implemented. I have made up my mind to rebel, to rebel against revisionism, to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, to rebel against the capitalist reactionary line, and resolutely defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. I stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

	Some people maliciously seize on various shortcomings of the revolutionary masses and say that the revolutionary masses are "terrible." At this time, I reread Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the real struggle, I feel the direction is clearer and my confidence is greater. I enthusiastically cheer: The revolutionary masses are great!

	At that time, although the capitalist reactionary line was still quite rampant, those who insisted on the capitalist reactionary line were still quite arrogant, and the strength of the reactionary organization "Red Guards" was still considerable. However, I firmly supported the revolutionary masses and stood on their side. One day, a young worker from the Dongfeng Meat Factory, which is under the company, came to see me and talked about his experience of being attacked by the capitalist reactionary line. He said he had made up his mind not to fear sacrifice and to fight the capitalist reactionary line to the end. This worker's revolutionary resolve made me admire him, and I completely sympathized with him and supported him. I said, I was originally a poor peasant and came out to revolution because I resisted the oppression of the landlords. At that time, I had a belief: Revolution is not afraid of death, and if you are afraid of death, you will not revolutionize. Today, we rise up to rebel and make a revolution, and I have strengthened this belief even more. We encouraged each other and decided to fight on. A few days later, a member of the rebel faction from the company's office came to see me and also talked about his resolve to fight the capitalist reactionary line to the end. He said he was prepared to accept the challenge of the capitalist reactionary line and to be labeled a "counter-revolutionary." I said, for the revolution, we must struggle and there will be sacrifices. We should make more thorough ideological preparations. In the early stages of the movement, I was labeled a "counter-revolutionary revisionist," and I was prepared to go to jail. The more we talked, the greater our resolve to fight counter-revolutionary revisionism and the capitalist reactionary line to the end.

	During these days, I maintained close contact with the revolutionary masses. I went to the grassroots to find the revolutionary masses, and sometimes I also participated in their meetings. When the "Red Guards" came to find me, I did not go. I thought the overall direction of the "Red Guards'" struggle was wrong. I did not sympathize with them, did not support them, and I had to fight against the wrong words and deeds of their leaders. Once, I went to a grassroots unit and held a meeting with the rebel faction members. The next day, the "Red Guards" sent a group of people to grab me, saying I was "inciting the masses to fight the masses." I was not afraid of being grabbed. My overall direction is correct, and the revolutionary comrades support me.

	At this time, someone came to "advise" me again. They said: "Leaders should support the revolutionary masses, and should not be biased towards one side."

	I loudly replied to them: No, no, a million times no. In the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the two classes and two lines, you either stand on the side of the proletariat or on the side of the bourgeoisie. Being impartial is false and impossible. I can only lean to one side, which is the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, I support and insist on; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, I oppose and fight against. Against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and their puppet organizations, they must be overthrown and disbanded. Revolutionary leaders must rebel and lean towards the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

	After I publicly expressed my support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and joined the ranks of criticizing the capitalist reactionary line, someone said to me: "The situation is unclear at the moment, you are a leader, your words carry weight, it is better to say less and not give people a handle to grab."

	At that time, I thought there was some truth in these words, but later I thought, these words are wrong. To be afraid of speaking out, to put it bluntly, is to be afraid of the masses, afraid of the revolution. To speak for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, to speak revolutionary words, what is there to be afraid of? The revolutionary masses of the proletariat dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to struggle, and dare to win. I should learn their revolutionary spirit of daring to do. For the revolutionary cause, for defending the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, for defending the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, one must speak out loudly. For the revolution, one must not be afraid of being grabbed by the hair. I not only spoke out, but I also maintained a clear attitude throughout, supporting what should be supported and opposing what should be opposed, and gained the trust of the revolutionary masses.

	I also considered whether the revolutionary masses of the proletariat would believe in me after I rebelled. Later, I realized that this was a manifestation of selfish individualism. In the blazing fire of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it should be burned away. For a long time, I was in a leading position, not realizing that I am both a force for revolution and an object of revolution. I lacked ideological preparation and revolutionary self-awareness to pass through the socialist stage; I only abstractly admitted that my worldview had not been transformed, but I did not find the root of the problem. Therefore, in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, I still felt a bit aggrieved about the criticisms of the revolutionary masses. Through the movement and through the struggle to touch my soul, I realized that I should accept the supervision of the masses and dare to criticize myself. The masses have sharp eyes. The revolutionary masses, after investigation, made a realistic analysis of my shortcomings and mistakes, and I was deeply moved. In my heart, I repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's teaching: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party." We leaders must resolutely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao: "You should put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." Put down your airs, go to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, learn from them, be a small student of the masses, and share their breath and destiny. In this way, you will definitely be welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

	In my work, I also made various mistakes. I believe that every revolutionary cadre who has made mistakes must put down their burdens, start their engines, and win the trust of the revolutionary masses with their actual actions of correcting mistakes. The revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They take the correct attitude of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the patient" towards cadres who have made mistakes. In the movement, they criticize us to care for us, to protect us, and to help us get rid of big and small mistakes.

	In this unprecedented storm of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of young revolutionaries nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought have emerged. Revolutionary leaders should have a full heart of enthusiasm and humbly learn from them. I am determined to undergo the severe test of this revolutionary struggle, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to fight alongside the broad revolutionary masses to complete the great task of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边
    原上海市食品公司党委书记　王坤
    在一个时期内，我对伟大的无产阶级文化大革命很不理解。半年多尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争教育了我，使我猛醒过来，认识到不搞这场无产阶级文化大革命，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    不彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线就不能得到贯彻。我下定决心，起来造反，造修正主义的反，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反，坚决保卫党中央、保卫毛主席，坚定地站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线这一边。
    某些人别有用心地抓住革命派这样那样的缺点，说什么革命派“糟得很”。这时，我又重学了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》。用毛泽东思想来分析现实斗争，就觉得方向更明，信心更大。我热烈地欢呼：革命派好得很。
    那时，尽管资产阶级反动路线还相当猖狂，坚持资产阶级反动路线的人还相当嚣张，反动组织“赤卫队”的势力还不小，但是，我坚决支持革命派，站在他们一边。有一天，公司所属东风肉类厂革命派一个青年工人来找我，同我谈到他受资产阶级反动路线打击的经过。他说，他已下定决心，不怕牺牲，要同资产阶级反动路线斗争到底。这个工人的革命决心使我敬佩，我完全同情他，支持他。我说，我原来是个贫农，因为反抗地主的压迫，出来干革命。那时，我有个信念，就是革命不怕死，怕死不革命。今天，我们起来造反，闹革命，我更加强了这个信念。我们互相鼓励，决心战斗下去。过了几天，公司科室一位造反队员又来找我，也谈到了同资产阶级反动路线斗争到底的决心。他说，他准备接受资产阶级反动路线的挑战，准备被打成“反革命分子”。我说，为革命就要奋斗，就会有牺牲。我们应该作更充分的思想准备。我在运动初期被打成“反革命修正主义分子”，我是准备去坐牢的。我们越谈，同反革命修正主义，同资产阶级反动路线斗争到底的决心就越大。
    在这些日子里，我同革命派同志保持密切的联系，我下基层就找革命派，有时也去参加他们的会议。而“赤卫队”来找我，我就是不去。我认为“赤卫队”的斗争大方向是错误的。我就是不同情他们，不支持他们，而且要同他们的头头的错误言行进行斗争。有一次，我到一个基层单位同造反队员开了会，第二天，“赤卫队”派了一帮人来揪我，说我“挑动群众斗群众”。我不怕揪。我的大方向是正确的，革命派的同志支持我。
    这时，又有人来向我进行“劝告”了。他们说：“领导干部嘛，支持革命群众，就应该不偏不倚，不要偏心于那一派。”
    我响亮地回答他们：不能，不能，一万个不能。在无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，要么站在无产阶级一边，要么站在资产阶级一边，不偏不倚是假的，是不可能的。我只能倒向一边，就是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边、无产阶级革命派一边。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我就拥护，就坚持；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，我就反对，就斗争。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以及他们的御用组织，就是要打倒，就是要瓦解。革命领导干部要造反，就要向无产阶级革命派一边倒。
    当我公开表示支持无产阶级革命派，投入批判资产阶级反动路线斗争的行列后，又有人对我说：“现在形势一下子看不清，你是领导干部，说话举足轻重，要少说为妙，不要给人抓了小辫子。”
    当时，我还认为这话有些道理，但后来想想，这话不对。怕讲话，戳穿了说，就是怕群众、怕革命。为无产阶级革命派说话，说革命的话，怕什么。无产阶级革命派就是敢想，敢说，敢闯，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。我应该学习他们的“敢”字当头的革命精神。为革命事业，为捍卫党中央、毛主席，捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就要大讲特讲。为革命就不怕抓辫子。我不仅讲了，而且，我始终态度明朗，该赞成的赞成，该反对的反对，得到了革命群众的信任。
    我也曾考虑过，我起来造反，无产阶级革命派会不会相信我。后来我认识到，这正是患得患失的个人主义思想在作怪。在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，正应该烧它一烧。长期以来，我高居于领导地位，不认识自己既是革命的动力，又是革命的对象。对于过社会主义这一关，缺乏思想准备，缺乏革命自觉性；只抽象地承认世界观没有改造好，却没有找到病根所在。因此，在文化大革命初期，对革命群众的批评，还感到有点委屈。通过运动，通过触动自己灵魂的斗争，我认识到应该接受群众的监督，敢于革自己的命。群众的眼睛是雪亮的。革命群众经过考察，对我的缺点和错误做了实事求是的分析，我非常感动，在内心深处反复地诵念毛主席“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党”的教导。我们当领导干部的，一定要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席发出的号召：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”放下架子，到无产阶级革命派中去，向他们学习，当群众的小学生，和他们同呼吸、共命运，这样，就一定会受到革命群众的欢迎。
    在工作中，我也有这样那样的错误。我认为每个犯过错误的革命干部，必须放下包袱，开动机器，用自己改正错误的实际行动来取得革命群众的信任。革命群众是听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策的。他们对待犯错误的干部，总是抱着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的正确态度的。他们在运动中批评我们，是为了关心我们，爱护我们，帮助我们丢掉大大小小的错误。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，涌现出了大批为毛泽东思想所哺育成长的革命小将。革命的领导干部对这支伟大的新生力量，应该抱着满腔的热情，虚心地向他们学习。我决心经受这场革命斗争严峻的考验，活学活用毛主席著作，同广大革命群众一起，为胜利完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大任务而战斗到底。
