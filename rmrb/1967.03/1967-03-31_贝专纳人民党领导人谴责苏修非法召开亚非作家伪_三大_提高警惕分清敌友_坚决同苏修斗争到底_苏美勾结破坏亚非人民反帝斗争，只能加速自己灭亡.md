Botswana People's Party leader condemns Soviet revisionists' illegal "third congress" of Asian and African writers

	Be on guard, distinguish between friends and enemies, and resolutely fight the Soviet revisionists to the end

	The Soviet-American collusion to sabotage the anti-imperialist struggle of Asian and African peoples will only hasten their own doom

	According to a report from Cairo on the 28th by Xinhua News Agency, Bobbi Mark, a member of the National Executive Committee of the Botswana People's Party, issued a statement here on the 28th strongly condemning the fake "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" planned by Soviet revisionists in Beirut. He also firmly supports the revolutionary Third Congress of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing this year.

	The statement expressed the Botswana People's Party's unconditional and unequivocal support for the important statement issued by the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers on March 21, condemning the Soviet revisionists' fake "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" in Beirut.

	The statement said: "We call on all revolutionary Asian and African writers to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers to fully participate in the Third Congress to be held in Beijing this year. All our writers and people should contribute in various ways to ensure the great success of the congress and the miserable failure of the Soviet revisionists and their followers."

	The statement said: "Our party and people, having learned from Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings on 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution,' have been able to distinguish true friends from true enemies and have heightened their vigilance. Therefore, our party and people reaffirm their support for the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers located in Colombo—the only legitimate organization of revolutionary Asian and African writers. We also announce our resolute support for its executive secretariat in Beijing and support all decisions of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers."

	The statement said: "Our party and people adhere to the decisions made at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing in June 1966, maintain the clear revolutionary stance taken by our delegation at the emergency meeting, and adhere to our common anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist stance. We will continue to unmask and condemn the persistent and hidden evil plots of the Soviet revisionists to sabotage and split the Asian and African writers' movement and other Asian and African movements."

	The statement pointed out: "The Soviet revisionists' evil plot to hold the fake 'Third Congress of Asian and African Writers' in Beirut has further exposed their ugly face of sabotaging and splitting the Asian and African peoples... They have degenerated into the number one enemy of the people of the world, the running dogs and tools of American imperialism. The statement said that all reactionary forces, when on the verge of extinction, always make desperate struggles against revolutionary forces. The various attempts by the United States and Soviet revisionists to deceive the Asian and African peoples will only hasten their own doom."

    贝专纳人民党领导人谴责苏修非法召开亚非作家伪“三大”
    提高警惕分清敌友　坚决同苏修斗争到底
    苏美勾结破坏亚非人民反帝斗争，只能加速自己灭亡
    据新华社开罗二十八日电　贝专纳人民党全国执行委员会委员波比·马克二十八日在这里发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者策划的在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，并坚决支持将于今年在北京举行的革命的第三届亚非作家大会。
    声明表示，贝专纳人民党毫无保留地和毫不含糊地支持亚非作家常设局三月二十一日发表的谴责苏修在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的重要声明。
    声明说：“我们呼吁所有革命的亚非作家斗志昂扬地响应亚非作家常设局发出的全力参加今年在北京举行的第三届大会的号召，我们所有的作家和人民应该以各种方式作出贡献，使大会取得巨大胜利，使苏修及其追随者遭到悲惨失败。”
    声明说：“我们的党和人民由于学习了毛泽东主席的‘谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。’的教导，已经能够区分真正的朋友和真正的敌人，充分提高警惕。因此，我们的党和人民重申他们支持设在科伦坡的亚非作家常设局——革命的亚非作家唯一合法的运动。我们还宣布，坚决支持它设在北京的执行书记处，支持亚非作家常设局一切决定。”
    声明说：“我们党和我国人民遵守一九六六年六月在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议上作出的决定，坚持我们代表团在紧急会议上所采取的明确的革命立场，坚持我们反帝反修的共同立场，将坚定不移地继续揭露和谴责苏修破坏和分裂亚非作家运动和其他亚非运动的顽固不化和隐蔽的罪恶阴谋。
    声明指出：“苏修罪恶地策划了在贝鲁特举行的伪‘第三届亚非作家大会’，已经进一步暴露了他们破坏和分裂亚非人民的丑恶嘴脸……他们已经堕落成为全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义的走狗和工具。声明说，一切反动势力在快要灭亡的时候总是要对革命力量进行垂死的挣扎。美国和苏联修正主义愚弄亚非人民的种种企图只会加速他们自己的灭亡。
