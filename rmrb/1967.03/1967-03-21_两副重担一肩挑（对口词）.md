	Two Heavy Burdens on One Shoulder
	(Duo Kou Ci)

	Beijing First Machine Tool Factory "Foundry Red Flag"  Yu Qiyuan

	Spring thunder roars, red flags flutter. The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat surges like a spring tide. Holding the letter from the Party Central Committee, we remember Chairman Mao's instructions: "Grasp the revolution, promote production," carrying two heavy burdens on one shoulder. Look! Thousands and tens of thousands of soldiers charge into battle; listen! War drums and military bugles echo through the clouds. Everyone whips their horses forward, each person leaps like a dragon or tiger. The blazing furnace fire illuminates the challenge book; the rhythm of the hammers blows the advance signal. Pursuing each other, like a surging spring tide; production competitions, like vast waves. With broad minds and grand plans, hearts filled with boundless passion. Revolutionizing frugality, we strive for self-reliance and show our skills; thrift in managing the factory, we strive to strengthen and display our prowess. Swinging the hammer, we strive for high production efficiency; holding the handle, we ensure high product quality. We must make the red lines on the charts rise daily, and let the broadcasts report victories every day. Following the great leader Chairman Mao, we advance along the revolutionary line; following the great leader Chairman Mao, we hold the revolutionary red flag high. The proletarian revolutionary faction must be the most outstanding model for grasping the revolution and promoting production; the proletarian revolutionary faction will forever create new achievements for the proletarian cause. We vow to achieve double victories in revolution and production, letting the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine upon the entire globe!

    两副重担一肩挑
    （对口词）
    北京第一机床厂“铸工红旗”  于启元春雷滚滚，红旗飘飘。无产阶级革命派，斗志如春潮。手捧党中央给咱的信，牢记毛主席对咱的教导：“抓革命，促生产”，两副重担一肩挑。看！千军万马齐上阵，听！战鼓军号冲云霄；人人扬鞭策马，个个龙腾虎跃。熊熊炉火，映红挑战书；阵阵锤声，吹响进军号。你追我赶，好似春潮翻滚；生产竞赛，势如巨浪波涛。胸怀开阔起宏图，心中豪情逐浪高。节约闹革命，咱要自力更生显身手；勤俭办工厂，咱要奋发图强逞英豪。抡铁锤，力求生产高效率；握摇柄，保证产品质量高。要叫图表上的红线日日往上升，要让广播里的消息天天传捷报。跟着伟大领袖毛主席，沿着革命路线往前走；跟着伟大领袖毛主席，革命红旗举得高。无产阶级革命派，要做抓革命、促生产最出色的模范；无产阶级革命派，永为无产阶级事业创立新功劳。誓夺革命生产双胜利，让毛泽东思想光辉把全球普照！
