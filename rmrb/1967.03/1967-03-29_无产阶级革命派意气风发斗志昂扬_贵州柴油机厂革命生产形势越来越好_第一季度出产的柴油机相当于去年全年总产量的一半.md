The proletarian revolutionary faction at Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, which has firmly grasped the power of cultural revolution and production, has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have completed the first quarter's national plan five days ahead of schedule. The factory's diesel engine production in the first quarter is equivalent to half of last year's annual total production. The quality of each unit meets national standards, and the cost has been reduced by about 10 percent compared to last year.

The proletarian revolutionary faction at Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party on January 24. On the day of the seizure, they formed two leadership teams for revolution and production, establishing a temporary production command system from the bottom up, consisting of revolutionary workers, technical personnel, and leading cadres. The revolutionary workers enthusiastically responded to the new leadership's call, using actual actions to smash the class enemy's plot to sabotage production. They fought continuously for seven days and successfully completed the January production plan ahead of schedule and over quota. In February, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory thwarted another counterattack planned by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power, and the production situation continued to improve.

Entering March, the revolutionary workers of this factory were even more spirited and high in morale, and the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory became increasingly better. The revolutionary workers have formed administrative departments from the bottom up, and each workshop has established a united combat organization. A new order for revolution and production is gradually being established. At this time, the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" arrived at the factory. All revolutionary workers were elated. Many work teams held nightly discussions, vowing to complete the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule and report the good news to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The assembly workshop, due to a power outage the next day, launched a nighttime battle and assembled 24 diesel engines overnight. The mechanical processing workshop was originally the weakest link in the entire factory, but because of the cooperation between various workshops and processes, other workshops and departments also sent people to support, resulting in the timely completion of parts and components needed for the assembly of diesel engines in March on the 23rd, providing favorable conditions for the entire factory to complete the monthly task ahead of schedule.

Under the encouragement and impetus of the Party Central Committee's letter, the factory's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, the Revolutionary Committee, was established on March 24. The revolutionary workers are full of confidence and vigor, further launching a high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production, determined to make new contributions to the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's national production plan.

    无产阶级革命派意气风发斗志昂扬
    贵州柴油机厂革命生产形势越来越好
    第一季度出产的柴油机相当于去年全年总产量的一半
    新华社贵阳二十八日电　已经掌握了全厂文化革命和生产大权的贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命派，最坚决地响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，提前五天全面完成了第一季度国家计划。这个厂第一季度出产的柴油机，产量相当于去年全年总产量的一半，质量台台合乎国家标准，成本比去年降低百分之十左右。
    贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命派是在一月二十四日从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺权的。夺权的当天，他们就组成了革命和生产两个领导班子，自下而上地成立了由革命工人、技术人员和领导干部参加的临时生产指挥系统。广大革命职工热烈响应新的领导班子的号召，用实际行动粉碎了阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋。他们连续奋战七天，终于提前超额完成了一月份生产计划。二月份，全厂革命职工又粉碎了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派策划的新反扑，生产情况继续好转。
    进入三月以后，这个厂的革命派职工更是意气风发，斗志昂扬，全厂革命和生产形势愈来愈好。革命职工自下而上地按行政部门的大联合已经形成，各个车间都成立了联合战斗组织，革命和生产的新秩序逐步建立。正在这个时候，《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》传到了这个工厂，广大革命职工无不欢欣鼓舞。许多班组连夜组织座谈讨论，提出一定要提前完成第一季度计划，向毛主席和党中央报喜。装配车间因为第二天停电，当晚开展了一场突击战，一夜抢装了二十四台柴油机。机械加工车间原来是全厂的薄弱环节，但是因为各工段和工序之间开展了大协作，其他车间和科室也都派人前来支援，结果提前在二十三日交齐了三月份装配柴油机所需要的零件和部件，为全厂提前完成全月任务提供了有利条件。
    在党中央信件的鼓舞和推动下，这个厂革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构革命委员会在三月二十四日成立。广大革命职工满怀信心，干劲倍增，进一步掀起抓革命、促生产的高潮，决心为完成和超额完成今年全年的国家生产计划作出新的贡献。
