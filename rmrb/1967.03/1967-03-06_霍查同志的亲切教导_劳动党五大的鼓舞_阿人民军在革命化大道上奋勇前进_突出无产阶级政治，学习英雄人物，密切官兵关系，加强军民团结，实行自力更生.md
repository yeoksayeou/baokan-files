The heroic Albanian People's Army, under the care and guidance of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and the revolutionary measures taken by the Party, is advancing vigorously on the path of revolutionization.

Recently, a reporter from this news agency visited a coastal defense unit of the Albanian People's Army. The officers and soldiers of this unit, like those of other units in the Albanian People's Army, enthusiastically welcomed and firmly implemented the instructions of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, carrying out a series of revolutionary measures. They restored the party committee system, re-established the position of political commissar, abolished military ranks, and maintained and carried forward the glorious traditions of the Albanian People's Army. After the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party, all officers and soldiers in the unit actively studied and implemented the documents and resolutions of the Fifth Congress, especially carefully studying Comrade Hoxha's report and Chairman Mao's telegram of congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party.

Since last year, the unit's party committee has emphasized proletarian politics, stressing the importance of ideological work, and has achieved great success. The role of the party and youth league organizations in the unit has been significantly strengthened. Many outstanding soldiers have joined the party and youth league organizations. The party organizations at all levels often organize cadres and soldiers to study the heroic deeds of Adam Reka, Lei Feng, Cai Yongxiang, and other heroes, drawing great inspiration. They all expressed their determination to follow these heroes and make any sacrifice to defend the motherland, the people, and the interests of socialism.

The system of holding life meetings between officers and soldiers every month has been established for a year. During these meetings, superiors and subordinates, as well as colleagues, engage in criticism and self-criticism, strengthening the unity within the unit. The commanders at all levels also go deep into the ranks of the soldiers, get close to the actual situation, and set an example in all aspects, strengthening their relationship with the soldiers. Under the leadership of proletarian politics, this unit completed its heavy military training tasks one month ahead of schedule last year and achieved excellent results.

The unit also firmly implements the principle of self-reliance as taught by the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, focusing on food and subsidiary food production. After a year of effort, they have now achieved 50% self-sufficiency in grain, and more than enough in meat and vegetables. The soldiers also made many fishing nets by hand and sold the fish they caught to the state. The barracks, clubhouses, and some small arms repair workshops in this unit were all built by the officers and soldiers with their own hands in the past year, saving the state a large amount of money.

This unit has established a close relationship with the local residents, often going to agricultural cooperatives to help with harvesting, digging canals, and fertilizing, earning the praise of the broad masses. The Albanian People's Army has maintained and carried forward the characteristic of "coming from the people and serving the people" as Comrade Hoxha said. Today, it has become a shining example for the Albanian people to learn from. The Albanian people have unlimited love and trust for their army.

Chairman Mao said: "The army must blend with the people, so that the army appears in the eyes of the people as their own army. Such an army is invincible in the world." The Albanian People's Army, advancing on the path of revolutionization and combat readiness, is such an army.

    霍查同志的亲切教导　劳动党五大的鼓舞
    阿人民军在革命化大道上奋勇前进
    突出无产阶级政治，学习英雄人物，密切官兵关系，加强军民团结，实行自力更生
    据新华社地拉那电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，在阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的关怀和教导下，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党采取的革命化措施和劳动党第五次代表大会革命精神的鼓舞下，正在革命化的大道上奋勇前进。
    最近，本社记者访问了阿尔巴尼亚人民军某海防部队。这个海防部队的指战员同阿尔巴尼亚人民军的其他兄弟部队一样，热烈欢迎并坚决执行了劳动党和霍查同志的指示，实行了一系列革命化措施，恢复了党委制，重新设立了政治委员，取消了军衔，保持和发扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民军队的光荣传统。劳动党第五次代表大会以后，部队的全体指战员积极学习和贯彻第五次代表大会文件和决议，特别认真学习了霍查同志的报告和毛主席致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电。
    去年以来，部队党委突出无产阶级政治，强调把做人的政治思想工作放到首位，取得了很大的成绩。部队的党团组织的作用已经大大加强。一批批优秀的战士参加了党团组织。各级党组织经常组织干部和战士学习亚当·雷卡、雷锋、蔡永祥等英雄人物的英雄事迹，受到巨大鼓舞。他们纷纷表示要象这些英雄人物一样，为保卫祖国、人民和社会主义的利益不惜作出任何牺牲。
    部队的干部和战士在一起每月过一次生活会的制度，已经建立一年了。在生活会上，上下级之间、同级之间，开展批评与自我批评，加强了部队内部的团结。部队的各级指挥员，还深入广大战士，深入实际，在各方面以身作则，密切了同战士的关系。在无产阶级政治的统帅下，这个部队在去年提前一个月完成了繁重的军事训练任务，并且取得了十分优异的成绩。
    部队还根据劳动党和霍查同志的教导，坚决贯彻执行自力更生原则，大搞粮食和副食品生产，经过一年的努力，现在已经做到了粮食自给百分之五十，肉类和蔬菜自给有余。部队的战士们还自己动手编织了许多渔网，把捕获的鱼卖给国家。这个部队的营房、俱乐部和一些小型军械修理厂都是指战员用自己的双手在最近一年内修建的，为国家节约大量资金。
    这个部队与当地居民结成了亲如鱼水的关系。他们经常到农业生产合作社去帮助收割，挖渠，积肥，博得广大群众的好评。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军保持和发扬了霍查同志所说的，“来自人民而又为人民服务”的特点，今天它已经成了阿尔巴尼亚人民学习的光辉榜样。阿尔巴尼亚人民对自己的军队无限热爱和信赖。
    毛主席说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”，在革命化、战斗化大道上前进的阿尔巴尼亚人民军正是这样的军队。
