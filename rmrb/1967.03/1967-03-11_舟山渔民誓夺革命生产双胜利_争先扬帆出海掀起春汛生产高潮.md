The renowned Zhoushan fishing grounds in our country have begun the spring fishing season for catching small yellow croaker ahead of schedule. Broad masses of revolutionary fishermen have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." With the help of the local stationed People's Liberation Army, they have swiftly launched a high tide of spring fishing production. Currently, more than 200 pairs of motor-sailboats have set sail ahead of others, and each pair has caught over 10,000 pounds of small yellow croaker on average, firing the first shot for the spring fishing production in the East China Sea.

The broad masses of revolutionary fishermen in the Zhoushan fishing grounds have seriously studied the letter from the Central Committee of the Party to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country. They have resolutely responded to the great call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, vowing to achieve double victories in revolution and production. They have actively combined with revolutionary cadres, jointly making revolution, and together promoting production. Therefore, both the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the spring fishing production are being carried out vigorously.

    舟山渔民誓夺革命生产双胜利
    争先扬帆出海掀起春汛生产高潮
    新华社杭州十日电　我国著名的舟山渔场，捕捞小黄鱼的春汛生产已提前开始。广大革命渔民积极响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在人民解放军当地驻军帮助下迅速掀起了一个春汛生产的高潮。目前已争先扬帆出海的二百多对机帆船，平均每对已捕捞小黄鱼一万多斤，打响了东海春汛生产的第一炮。
    舟山渔场的广大革命渔民认真学习了党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，坚决响应毛主席、党中央发出的伟大号召，誓夺革命和生产的双胜利。他们积极地同革命干部相结合，一起闹革命，共同搞好生产。因此，文化大革命和春汛生产都搞得轰轰烈烈。
