	Rows of people and horses bustling with spring plowing
	In Chonghua, dawn after dawn the sunrise paints the sky with vibrant hues, and squad after squad of soldiers march into the villages. In their hands, they hold the Little Red Book, and one by one, the brave warriors descend into the fields. Group after group of commune members gather around, and waves of cheers echo across the land. Hand in hand, they grasp tightly, and a warm current surges through their hearts. Row after row of people and horses bustle with spring plowing, and line after line of soldiers and civilians set up their formations. Labor songs ring out, and production competitions spring up everywhere. Hoes dance up and down, and shovels sway back and forth. Poles loaded with yokes crisscross like shuttlecocks, and little carts zoom past swiftly. Every soldier is full of vigor, and every commune member is spirited. Quotations from the Chairman are etched in their hearts, and every word of them is like sweet dew sprinkled over their chests. Field after field of good land is transformed, and victory songs echo to the heavens. Heart after heart beats red for the Party, and sunflower after sunflower blooms towards the sun.

    一排排人马闹春耕
    崇华一道道朝霞放异彩，一队队战士到村寨，一本本红书拿在手，一个个闯将下田来。一群群社员围上来，一阵阵欢呼震四海，一双双大手紧紧握，一股股暖流涌心怀。一排排人马闹春耕，一列列军民把阵摆，一声声劳动号子起，一处处生产大竞赛。一把把铁镐上下舞，一张张钢锨前后摆，一条条扁担如穿梭，一辆辆小车飞样快。一个个战士干劲大，一个个社员志豪迈，一句句语录贴心头，一字字甘露洒胸怀。一片片良田换新装，一支支凯歌传天外，一颗颗红心永向党，一朵朵葵花向阳开。
