	Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires Li Zhongshi's Speech at the Capital's Various Circles of People Supporting the Vietnamese People's Anti-American National Salvation Struggle Conference
	The Chinese People Have Always Been Close Comrades of the Vietnamese People
	The Vietnamese People Will Surely Smash the U.S. Imperialists' War Escalation Plan

	New China News Agency, March 19th

	Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires Li Zhongshi, speaking at the capital's various circles of people supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle conference, said:

	On behalf of the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to comrades, friends, and various people's organizations in China for holding this grand meeting to commemorate the Vietnamese people's nationwide anti-American day and to support and aid the Vietnamese people in their resistance against American imperialist aggression.

	Seventeen years ago, on March 19, 1950, over fifty thousand people in Saigon took to the streets to demonstrate and march, marking a new and vigorous historical phase in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression. From that time on, the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation cause has achieved many great victories and has increasingly gained the sympathy and support of world public opinion. Today, we are very pleased to see that this historically significant day has become a day for people all over the world to support the Vietnamese people in their resistance against American imperialist aggression. It embodies the close combat unity between the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the Vietnamese people, and it is a great encouragement to our people who are engaged in the great anti-American national salvation struggle.

	In recent years, although American imperialism has suffered fatal blows from the military and people of both North and South Vietnam, due to its warlike and aggressive nature, it continues to strengthen and expand the war. Recently, it has taken even more serious steps to escalate the war, committing new crimes against the Vietnamese people.

	In the South, American imperialism has greatly strengthened its invading army, increasing the number of American puppet and mercenary troops to over a million. It has launched a second dry season "strategic counteroffensive," using the most barbaric weapons and the most brutal war tactics in an attempt to force the people of South Vietnam to surrender.

	In the North, American imperialism has intensified its destructive war, taking new and serious escalation measures: shelling the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from south of the demilitarized zone with artillery; systematically attacking coastal areas with warships from the Seventh Fleet; dropping mines into many rivers. In recent days, American planes have conducted indiscriminate bombing of industrial areas, residential areas, and water conservancy projects in the North, such as Thai Nguyen, Vinh Yen, Hong Gai, and Haiphong, and even bombed and killed farmers working in the fields in Thanh Hoa Province, threatening to launch more intense attacks on the North, including the capital Hanoi. American imperialism is planning to further intensify and expand the war of aggression through measures such as recruiting large numbers of reserves, increasing military budgets, and ordering its vassal states to invest more manpower and resources into this dirty war of aggression. Recently, it has openly admitted to deploying B-52 bombers to Thailand and is preparing to use these planes to launch attacks from Thai bases, killing more Vietnamese people. On the upcoming March 20, 1967, the gangsters from the White House and the Pentagon will gather in Guam to plot further expansion of the Vietnam War with the Vietnamese traitorous sellout clique. American imperialism's new escalation steps are making the situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia even more tense, seriously threatening peace in the region.

	American imperialism's intensification and expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam can only more clearly show that it is facing a very serious and comprehensive failure, has reached a dead end, and is sinking deeper and deeper into a desperate quagmire. Just as world public opinion is strongly condemning American imperialism and demanding that it must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, that American troops must withdraw from South Vietnam, and that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam must be recognized, American imperialism's serious escalation steps are obviously a brazen and unbridled provocation to the peace-loving and justice-seeking people of the world. These actions further expose its stubborn and warlike nature, further exposing the lies of the U.S. government's so-called "peace talks." American imperialism's intensified bombing and strafing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are attempts to pressure the Vietnamese people, stop support from the North to the South, and force the Vietnamese people to surrender and capitulate.

	However, American imperialism has always miscalculated. The Vietnamese people have never, and will never, surrender to the aggressor's bombs. If the United States continues to stubbornly refuse to accept the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which point out the only correct path to solving the Vietnamese problem, and instead tries to use more guns to talk, then the Vietnamese people will also use guns to give it the response it deserves.

	American imperialism's obsession with playing with fire will only result in it being burned to death by the increasingly intense hatred of the 31 million Vietnamese people. The fate of the American aggressors after the Guam conference will not be better than after the Honolulu conference and previous war conferences, but will only lead it to faster failure. The Vietnamese people are ready at any time to give American imperialism a fatal blow and will surely smash all its escalation plans. The recent brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of both North and South Vietnam are a powerful warning to American imperialism's new escalation steps.

	The victorious military and people of the South will press on to smash all American imperialist plans of aggression and achieve greater victories. The military and people of the North will firmly hold the production and combat fronts, determined to defeat all American imperialist war escalations and not retreat in the face of any enemy threats. The people of the North fully support and respond to the February 28, 1967 declaration of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, determined to fulfill their duty as the rear base of their flesh-and-blood southern compatriots under any circumstances. This is the unshakable will of our 31 million compatriots to fight to the end and win. This is the appropriate response to the new escalation of the American aggressors.

	Comrades and friends:

	We Vietnamese people clearly understand that our sacred struggle against American imperialism is not only for the independence and freedom of our homeland but also to fulfill our revolutionary duty to the oppressed nations in their struggle for independence and freedom, for world peace, democracy, and social progress. Therefore, the people of the world, especially the people of socialist countries, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have great sympathy for and increasingly powerful support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle. On this day of commemorating the Vietnamese people's nationwide anti-American day, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to friends from the five continents who have given enthusiastic support to our people's just struggle.

	The Vietnamese people are very pleased to see that the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have always stood with the Vietnamese people, providing sincere spiritual and material support for the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation cause. This is a great encouragement to our entire people. For a long time, in various places in the great People's Republic of China, a grand-scale mass movement to aid Vietnam and resist America has been launched, with various forms including rallies, marches, issuing statements, writing letters, sending telegrams, donating money, and donating medicine, and even expressing willingness to go to Vietnam at any time to fight side by side with our people, sacrificing their lives to resist American imperialism. The government of the People's Republic of China and various people's organizations in China have issued statements many times, issuing strong warnings to American imperialism and firmly supporting the correct position of the Vietnamese people, which is invaluable support for the Vietnamese people. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao of the Chinese people, in the struggle against American imperialist aggression, the brotherly Chinese people have always been close comrades of the Vietnamese people. We highly value this great support full of lofty internationalism and truly regard the vast territory of China as our broad and reliable rear base. On this occasion, I sincerely express the gratitude of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to all the brotherly Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the respected Chairman Mao.

	Comrades and friends:

	At present, the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is entering a tense and fierce stage. Our entire people are resolutely responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call on July 17, 1966, uniting as one, advancing bravely, and dealing heavier blows to American imperialism. The Vietnamese people have the determination of steel, and with the support of the seven hundred million brotherly Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and the people of the world who love peace, we will surely achieve victory. The Vietnamese people have never been so confident in their just and victorious cause, in the bright future of their homeland. The Vietnamese people are determined to bear all hardships and sacrifices, to overcome all obstacles, to unite and advance, to defend the North, to liberate the South, and to ultimately unify the country, fulfilling the glorious mission given to the Vietnamese nation by history and progressive humanity—to defeat the modern imperialist leader, American imperialism's aggression.

	The Vietnamese people will surely win!
	American imperialism will surely fail!
	Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!
	Long live the combat unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
	Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
	Long live the Vietnamese Labor Party!
	Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Ho!

    黎终始临时代办在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上讲话
    中国人民始终是越南人民的亲密战友
    越南人民必将粉碎美帝战争升级计划
    新华社十九日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上的讲话
    我谨代表越南人民和越南民主共和国驻华大使馆，对同志们、朋友们以及中国的各人民团体，为了纪念越南人民全国反美日、支持和声援越南人民抵抗美帝国主义侵略而举行的这个隆重集会，表示衷心的感谢。
    十七年前，一九五○年三月十九日，西贡市的五十多万人民走上街头，示威游行，为越南全国人民抵抗美帝国主义侵略，开辟了一个新的轰轰烈烈的历史阶段。从那时起，越南人民的抗美救国事业取得了许多巨大的胜利，并日益得到世界人民舆论的同情和支持。今天我们非常高兴地看到，这个具有历史意义的日子，已经成为全世界人民声援越南人民抵抗美帝国主义侵略的日子。它体现了世界人民，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，同越南人民的紧密的战斗团结，对正在进行伟大的抗美救国斗争的我国人民也是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    这些年来，美帝国主义虽然遭到了越南南北两方军民的致命打击，但是由于它的好战和侵略本性，它仍然不断地在加强和扩大战争。最近，它又采取了更加严重的战争升级，对越南人民犯下了许多新的罪行。
    在南方，美帝国主义大力加强它的侵略军队，把美伪军和仆从军的人数增加到一百多万，它疯狂地发动第二次旱季“战略反攻”，使用各种最野蛮的杀人武器和各种最残暴的战争手段，妄图迫使越南南方人民屈服。
    在北方，美帝国主义加强破坏性的战争，采取新的严重的升级：从非军事区以南用大炮轰击越南民主共和国的领土；用第七舰队的军舰有计划地连续袭击沿海地区；用飞机向许多江河投放水雷。近几天来，美国飞机又对越南北方的太原、越池、鸿基、海防等工业区、居民区和水利工程进行狂轰滥炸，甚至对我国太平省正在田里劳动的农民进行疯狂的轰炸和杀害，并扬言要对越南北方，包括首都河内，进行更激烈的袭击。美帝国主义正通过征募大量后备军，增加军事预算，命令它的仆从国把更多的人力、财力投入这场肮脏的侵略战争等措施，来加紧策划扩大侵略战争。最近，它已公开承认派遣Ｂ—52型飞机进驻泰国，并准备使用这种飞机，从泰国基地起飞，袭击和杀害更多的越南人民。在即将到来的一九六七年三月二十日，白宫和五角大楼的强盗头子们将汇集关岛，同越奸卖国集团一起，策划进一步扩大越南战火的阴谋。美帝国主义新的升级步骤正使得印度支那和东南亚的局势更加紧张，严重地威胁着这一地区的和平。
    美帝国主义加紧强化和扩大侵略越南战争，只能更加清楚地表明，它正面临着非常严重的、全面的失败，走到了穷途末路，越来越深地陷入绝望的泥沼。正当世界舆论都在强烈谴责美帝国主义，要求它必须永远地、无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，要求美国军队必须从越南南方撤走，要求承认越南南方民族解放阵线的时候，美帝国主义的这些严重的升级步骤显然是对全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民的一种蛮横的、肆无忌惮的挑衅。这些行动更加暴露了它的顽固和好战的嘴脸，更加戳穿了美国当局关于
  “和平谈判”的骗人论调。美帝国主义对越南民主共和国加紧进行轰炸和扫射，借此来对越南人民施加压力，妄图阻止北方对南方的支援，迫使越南人民向它屈服、投降。
    但是美帝国主义总是打错了算盘。越南人民从来没有，也永远不会在侵略者的炸弹面前屈服。如果美国仍然顽固地拒绝接受越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明所指出的关于解决越南问题的唯一正确的途径，而想更多地用枪炮来对话，那么越南人民也将用枪炮来给予它以应有的回答。　
    美帝国主义热中于玩火，就必将被三千一百万越南人民日益炽烈的仇恨火焰活活烧死。美国侵略者在关岛会议以后的命运，绝不会比在檀香山会议和历次战争会议以后的命运更好一些，而只能使它更快地走向失败。越南人民随时准备给予美帝国主义以致命的打击，并必将粉碎它的一切升级计划。最近，越南南北两方军民所取得的辉煌胜利，正是对美帝国主义新的升级步骤的有力警告。
    在胜利中的南方军民必将乘胜前进，粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略计划，争取更大的胜利。北方军民将坚守生产和战斗两条战线，决心打败美帝国主义的一切战争升级，决不在敌人的任何威胁面前退缩。北方人民完全支持和响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六七年二月二十八日的声明，在任何情况下都决心履行他们作为骨肉的南方同胞的大后方的义务。这是我们全国三千一百万同胞不可动摇的决战决胜的意志。这是对美国侵略者的新升级的应有的回答。
    同志们和朋友们：
    我们越南人民非常清楚地懂得，我们神圣的抗美救国斗争，不仅是为了祖国的独立、自由，也是为了履行我们对被压迫民族争取独立、自由斗争的革命义务，为了世界和平、民主和社会进步。因此，全世界人民，特别是社会主义各国人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，非常同情和越来越有力地支持越南人民的正义斗争。在纪念越南人民全国反美日的时候，我谨向给予我国人民的正义斗争以充满热情的支持的五大洲朋友们，表示衷心的感谢。
    越南人民非常高兴地看到，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的，正在轰轰烈烈地进行无产阶级文化大革命的七亿兄弟中国人民始终一贯地同越南人民站在一起，并在精神上和物质上真诚地支援越南人民的抗美救国事业。这是对我们全国人民的巨大鼓舞。长期以来，在伟大的中华人民共和国各地，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大规模的援越抗美群众运动，这个运动的形式丰富多样，包括集会、游行、发表声明、写信、发电报、捐款、捐送药品等，甚至还表示随时志愿到越南同我们的人民并肩战斗，为抗击美帝国主义献出自己的生命。中华人民共和国政府和中国各人民团体曾经多次发表声明，向美帝国主义发出强有力的警告，并坚决支持越南人民正确的立场，这是对越南人民无比宝贵的支援。在以中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，兄弟的中国人民始终是越南人民亲密的战友。我们对这种巨大的、充满着崇高的国际主义精神的支援给以很高的评价，并且真正把中国辽阔的国土看成是自己广大的可靠的后方。借此机会，我怀着真诚的心情，表达越南人民、越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府对全体兄弟的中国人民、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和敬爱的毛主席的深切谢意。
    同志们和朋友们：
    目前，越南人民的抗美救国战争正在进入紧张激烈的阶段，我们全国人民坚决响应胡志明主席在一九六六年七月十七日发出的神圣号召，万众一心，奋勇前进，给予美帝国主义以更沉重的打击。越南人民具有钢铁般的决心，又有七亿兄弟的中国人民、社会主义各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，必将取得胜利。越南人民对自己的正义和必胜的事业，对祖国的光明前途，从来不象现在这样充满信心。越南人民决心承担一切艰苦牺牲，斩荆披棘排除障碍，团结向前，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国，完成历史和进步人类所赋予我们越南民族的光荣任务——打败现代帝国主义的头子美帝国主义的侵略。
    越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义必败！
    越中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民战斗的团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    越南劳动党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！胡主席万岁！
