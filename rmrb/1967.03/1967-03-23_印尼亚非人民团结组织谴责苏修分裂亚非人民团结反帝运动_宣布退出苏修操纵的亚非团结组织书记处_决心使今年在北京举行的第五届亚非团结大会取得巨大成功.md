The Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization of Indonesia issued a statement on the 20th, calling on all members of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization to condemn and expose the activities of the Soviet revisionists in splitting the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement, and to mobilize all forces to ensure the great success of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in China.

The statement pointed out that the so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting held in Cyprus in February this year was entirely manipulated by the Soviet revisionists. The purpose was to split the Asian-African people's solidarity organization movement and to attack the People's Republic of China—the most reliable and powerful bastion and great revolutionary base of the peoples of all countries in the world. This meeting violated the most basic regulations of an international organization, shamelessly and illegally "passed" a "resolution" to overturn the decision made at the Fourth Conference held in Winneba, Ghana, that the Fifth Conference would be held in China.

The statement said that the Soviet revisionists are desperately trying to move the venue of the Fifth Conference from China to another place because they are terrified of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They know that the Fifth Conference, under the inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, will certainly achieve great success. However, they have met with complete failure.

The statement strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for manipulating the illegal Cyprus meeting, inviting and accepting revisionist and splitist groups from Ceylon and Japan as members of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization. It condemned the meeting for passing a resolution on the so-called "Spirit of Tashkent" to praise their line of capitulationist "peaceful coexistence." However, they did not mention a word about the horrendous and heinous massacre carried out by the fascist Suharto-Nasution regime.

The statement said that the permanent secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo, because it has become a tool for the Soviet revisionists to split the Asian-African people's solidarity movement, can no longer perform the tasks entrusted to it by the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

The statement said that Indonesia, which was elected as the secretary of the permanent secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, announces its withdrawal from the permanent secretariat in Cairo. It will, together with all other members of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization who uphold the resolutions of the Fourth Conference held in Winneba, especially with the host country of the Fifth Conference—China, make every effort to ensure the great success of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in China this year.

    印尼亚非人民团结组织谴责苏修分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动
    宣布退出苏修操纵的亚非团结组织书记处
    决心使今年在北京举行的第五届亚非团结大会取得巨大成功
    新华社讯　印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织二十日发表声明，呼吁一切亚非人民团结组织成员，谴责和揭露苏联修正主义者分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的活动，并动员一切力量使在中国举行的第五届亚非人民团结组织大会取得巨大胜利。
    声明指出，今年二月在塞浦路斯举行的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议，完全是苏修操纵的。目的是为了分裂亚非人民团结组织运动，为了攻击中华人民共和国——世界各国人民最可靠、最强大的堡垒和伟大的革命基地。这个会议，破坏了一个国际组织的最基本的规定，无耻地和非法地“通过”一个“决议”，推翻了在加纳的温尼巴举行的第四届大会上作出的第五届大会将在中国举行的决定。
    声明说，苏修拚命地要把第五届大会的会址从中国移到另外一个地方，因为他们对伟大的毛泽东思想怕得要死，他们知道，第五届大会在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下必将取得伟大成就。但是，他们遭到了完全的失败。
    声明强烈谴责苏修操纵非法的塞浦路斯会议，邀请并接纳了锡兰和日本那样的修正主义分裂主义集团作为亚非人民团结组织的成员。谴责了这个会议通过关于所谓的“塔什干精神”的决议，以吹捧他们的“和平共处”的投降主义路线。而他们对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权进行的骇人听闻的罪大恶极的屠杀，却只字不提。
    声明说，亚非人民团结组织驻开罗常设书记处由于它充当了苏联修正主义者分裂亚非人民团结运动的工具，已经完全不能履行第四届亚非人民团结大会所委托给它担负的任务。
    声明说，被选为亚非人民团结组织常设书记处书记的印度尼西亚，宣布它退出设在开罗的常设书记处，并且将同维护在温尼巴举行的第四届大会决议的亚非人民团结组织其它所有成员，特别是同第五届大会的东道国——中国一起，尽最大努力，使今年将在中国举行的第五届亚非人民团结大会获得巨大成功。
