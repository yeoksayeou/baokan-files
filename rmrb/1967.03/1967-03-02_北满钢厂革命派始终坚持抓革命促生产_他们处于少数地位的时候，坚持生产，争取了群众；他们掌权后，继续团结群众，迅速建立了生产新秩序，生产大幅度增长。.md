The revolutionary faction of Beiman Steel Plant has consistently focused on revolution and promoted production. When they were in the minority, they insisted on production and won over the masses; after they took power, they continued to unite the masses and quickly established a new production order, leading to a significant increase in production.

Editor's Note: The revolutionary workers of Beiman Steel Plant have set a shining example of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The "Red Rebels" of this plant have, whether in the minority or the majority, in the struggle against counter-revolutionary economism, and in the struggle for power, consistently adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to "grasp revolution and promote production."

The revolutionary workers of Beiman Steel Plant have stood up and taken control of the factory's power, quickly establishing a new production order and a new leadership structure from the bottom up, focusing their efforts on ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of production targets, presenting a new and vibrant face.

The experience of Beiman Steel Plant is worthy of study and emulation by revolutionary workers and masses across the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 1: The proletarian revolutionary faction of Beiman Steel Plant has, in their struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production." When they were in the minority, they insisted on production and won over the masses; after they took power, they continued to unite the masses and quickly established a new production order, leading to a significant increase in production.

At the end of last December, when the Red Rebels of Beiman Steel Plant were still in the minority, the "Red Alliance" and three other conservative groups organized about 2,000 to 3,000 people to leave their production posts and launched a three-day attack on them. The Red Rebels organized about 100 people to take turns debating with them (these people went to work on their own), and most of the Red Rebels remained at their production posts. The office Red Rebels also went to the production front lines, organizing cooperation between different shifts and trades. Under their arduous efforts, the main equipment of the entire plant remained in normal operation. The Red Rebels, in the face of the conservative forces' numerical superiority, remained at their production posts, educating the masses, and many people, through debate, spontaneously joined the rebels.

In January, the Red Rebels became the majority. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party Committee tried to mobilize a large number of workers to disrupt production, but their tricks were exposed, and a counter-revolutionary economism wind blew. They issued more than 10,000 yuan, inciting more than 100 workers (each receiving more than 100 yuan) to leave their production posts and go to Beijing to complain. Among these 100 people, many were workers with special skills. For example, the transport workshop had 11 drivers, stokers, and switchmen who were incited to go to Beijing. They were responsible for supplying the materials needed for the entire plant's production, transporting finished products, and supplying gas. If this workshop stopped production, other workshops would also have to stop, and all pipelines would have to be disconnected. It was clear that inciting them to go to Beijing was to provoke a larger-scale and longer-duration production halt.

At the critical moment when the factory's production was paralyzed, the Red Rebels, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, stood up firmly. They took over the factory's financial department on January 8, freezing all active funds. They then issued three orders, requiring a deputy director and a deputy chief engineer with minor issues to take charge of the factory's production command; ordering that no one could leave their production posts without permission. At this time, the storm of red power seizure came from Shanghai, and they were very excited, taking over the entire factory in one move.

During the tense days of power seizure, many Red Rebels worked day shifts and night shifts. Driver Zhang Enfu, despite being ill, single-handedly took on the work of four people, including driving, firing, shunting, and inspecting cars. Workers Wang Shuyin and Ma Lingsheng from the transport workshop worked continuously for 48 hours.

Many Red Rebels, after work, did not go home first but went to the rebel headquarters to receive battle tasks. Their minds were focused on revolution and production. They united the masses and quickly established a new production order.

They quickly established a new leadership structure for revolution and production from the bottom up, overcoming the previous lack of coordination in production links.

They concentrated their efforts on a decisive battle, mobilizing all Red Rebels to attack the weak links in transportation, ensuring the supply of raw materials and the output of finished products.

They mobilized the masses to obtain materials locally, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient scrap steel.

They responded to the Party's call, actively supporting the countryside, organizing mobile teams to repair electric motors and other tools for nearby people's communes.

After the Red Rebels took power, production quickly took on a new look. Comparing the first ten days of February (after the power seizure) with the first ten days of January (before the power seizure), the average daily output of steel increased by 22%, and the average daily output of steel products increased by 31%. February was able to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of production targets.

Currently, the Red Rebels of this plant are seriously studying the editorial of the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine. They have expressed their determination to do a good job in the "three-in-one combination" and achieve greater successes in grasping revolution and promoting production.

    北满钢厂革命派始终坚持抓革命促生产
    他们处于少数地位的时候，坚持生产，争取了群众；他们掌权后，继续团结群众，迅速建立了生产新秩序，生产大幅度增长。
    编者按：北满钢厂的革命工人，在无产阶级文化大革命中，树立了一面活学活用毛泽东思想的红旗。
    这个厂的“红色造反者”，在处于少数地位的时候，在处于多数地位的时候，在反对反革命经济主义的斗争中，在夺权斗争中，都坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决执行毛主席和党中央号召的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。
    北满钢厂的革命工人站起来，掌握着工厂的大权，迅速地建立了生产的新秩序，迅速地自下而上地建立了革命和生产两套班子，集中力量，为保证完成和超额完成生产指标而奋斗，出现了崭新的面貌。
    北满钢厂的经验，是值得全国各地的革命工人、革命群众学习和研究的。
    新华社哈尔滨一日电　北满钢厂无产阶级革命派，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，坚决贯彻了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示。在他们处于少数时，坚持生产，争取了群众；他们掌权后，继续团结群众，迅速建立了生产的新秩序，产量大幅度增长。
    去年十二月底，北满钢厂红色造反者还处于少数的时候，“红联”等四个保守派组织了二、三千人离开生产岗位，连续三天对他们进行围攻。红色造反者组织了一百多人轮流和他们辩论（这些人到上班时自己去上班），大部分红色造反者仍坚守生产岗位。机关的红色造反者也到生产第一线，组织不同班组和工种间的协作。在他们艰苦奋战下，全厂主要设备仍然维持了正常运转。红色造反者在保守派人多势众的围攻面前仍坚守生产岗位，教育了广大群众，许多人在辩论中自动站到红色造反者这边来，要求加入造反团。
    一月份，红色造反者成了多数。党委中一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派动员大批工人破坏生产的花招破了产，又刮起一股反革命经济主义的歪风。他们批了一万余元，唆使一百多工人（每人一百多元）离开生产岗位，去北京告状。这一百多人中，不少是具有特殊技术的工人。如运输车间被煽动进京的有十一个司机、司炉和扳道工人，他们担负全厂生产所需材料供给、成品输送和供应煤气等工作。这个车间一停产，其他车间都得停工，并且所有输送管道都要断裂。很显然，煽动他们进京，就是为了挑起规模更大、时间更长的停产事件。
    在工厂生产处于瘫痪的紧要关头，红色造反者想起毛主席的教导，顶天立地站了出来。他们在一月八日接管了厂的财务科，冻结了全部活动资金。接着宣布了三项通令，要求问题不大的一个副厂长和一个副总工程师负责全厂生产指挥；命令未经许可任何人不得擅离生产岗位。这时红色夺权的风暴从上海传来，他们十分兴奋，一举接管了全厂。
    在紧张的夺权日子里，许多红色造反者上完日班干夜班，司机张恩孚带病一个人担负了开车、烧火、调车、检车等四个人的工作。运输车间工人王树因、马岭生连续工作了四十八小时。
    许多红色造反者下班后不是先回家，而是先到造反团总部领受战斗任务，他们心里想的就是革命和生产。他们团结了广大工人，迅速地建立了生产的新秩序。
    他们迅速地自下而上建立了革命和生产两套班子，在生产指挥上建立了新的线和网，克服了过去生产环节不协调的现象。
    他们集中精力打歼灭战，动员全体红色造反者攻下运输上的薄弱环节，保证了原料的供应和成品的输出。
    他们发动群众就地取材，克服了废钢不足的困难。
    他们响应党的号召，积极支援农村，组织流动人员为附近的人民公社检修电动机等农具。
    红色造反者掌权后，生产上很快出现了新面貌。以二月份的前十天（夺权后）和一月份的前十天（夺权前）相比，钢的平均日产量增加百分之二十二，钢材平均日产量增加百分之三十一。二月份已能保证完成和超额完成生产指标。
    目前这个厂的红色造反者正在认真地学习《红旗》杂志第四期社论，他们表示：一定要搞好“三结合”，在抓革命、促生产中取得更大的成绩。
