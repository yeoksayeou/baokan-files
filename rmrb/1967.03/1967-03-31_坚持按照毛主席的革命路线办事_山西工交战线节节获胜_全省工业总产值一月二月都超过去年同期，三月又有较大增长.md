The industrial and transportation lines in Shanxi Province have achieved continuous victories by adhering to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The province's total industrial output in January and February exceeded the same periods last year, and March saw a significant increase.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan, March 30, the proletarian revolutionary factions on Shanxi Province's industrial and transportation fronts, after seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have resolutely responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "be thrifty to make revolution." They have achieved splendid victories in both revolution and production. Every system on the industrial and transportation fronts in the province is bustling with activity, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

Since mid-January, along with the continuous victories of the power seizure struggles by the proletarian revolutionary factions on Shanxi Province's industrial and transportation fronts, the production situation has improved month by month. The province's total industrial output in January was significantly higher than the same period last year, February's output increased by 9.3% compared to the same period last year, and March's output saw a significant increase compared to February.

Currently, an increasing number of factories, mines, and enterprises in Shanxi Province are following Chairman Mao's instructions to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Based on achieving great revolutionary unity, they correctly handle cadres, unite the majority of the masses, and have successively established and improved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, forming two leadership teams for leading the revolution and production. This is the political and organizational guarantee for Shanxi Province's industrial and transportation fronts to grasp the revolution and promote production.

Many factories and enterprises in Shanxi Province have, after seizing power, changed the wrong methods of leadership used by the power-holders who took the capitalist road in the past, such as "production targets first" and "emphasizing technology." They have vigorously emphasized proletarian politics, emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, and insisted on acting according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, giving these factories and enterprises a new look. The revolutionary factions in the coal industry, while focusing on production, mobilized the broad masses of workers to seriously discuss the relationship between improving production and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They discussed the position and role of Shanxi's coal production in the national economy. The revolutionary workers' enthusiasm soared, and the backward situation in coal production was quickly changed. Many industrial and transportation enterprises' proletarian revolutionary factions have put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place, carried out a thorough ideological revolution among the people, and unleashed the creative spirit of the masses, creating an unprecedented situation of vigorously promoting technological innovation and setting new production records. After the revolutionary factions of the Taiyuan Boiler Factory carried out a thorough ideological revolution, more than 90% of the technical personnel went deep into the production sites, strengthened their connection with the workers, and proposed more than 20 technological innovation projects, which played a significant role in completing the factory's production plan for January and February. Many enterprises have continuously set new production records. The Taiyuan First Thermal Power Plant's electricity generation created a new record that had not been seen in 13 years; the machinery production of the May 1st Machinery Factory created a new record that had not been seen in five years.

Many enterprises' revolutionary workers have broken many old rules and regulations that shackle the development of productive forces, established new rules and regulations that are conducive to production development, and accelerated production development. The revolutionary workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau smashed some revisionist rules and regulations, strengthened collective leadership, and implemented a new order of "mutual cooperation, close coordination, and joint operations," which effectively promoted production development. In February, the bureau's completed freight volume increased by 16% compared to January; in the first half of March, the daily over-fulfillment of the loading plan. By mid-March, the transportation of spring plowing materials had completed 65% of the monthly task.

The People's Liberation Army came to the industrial and transportation enterprises at critical moments, vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, helped the proletarian revolutionary factions organize and lead production, which is a very important factor in making the revolutionary and production situation on the industrial and transportation fronts better and better. At the critical moment when the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road in the Datong Coal Mine stirred up a black wind of economism, inciting workers to leave their production posts and causing production to be paralyzed, the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Datong area came to the Datong Coal Mine. The soldiers went deep into the mines, deep into the coal faces, deep into the canteens and dormitories, and studied the "Old Three Articles" with the workers, arousing the workers' class consciousness. They also vigorously propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," quickly restoring the mine's production. The People's Liberation Army in the Shanxi region, which fully supports the proletarian revolutionary factions, has fought side by side with the industrial front's proletarian revolutionary factions day and night, overcome one difficulty after another, and achieved double victories in revolution and production, creating new merits for the socialist revolution and construction cause.

    坚持按照毛主席的革命路线办事
    山西工交战线节节获胜
    全省工业总产值一月二月都超过去年同期，三月又有较大增长
    据新华社太原三十日电　山西省工业交通战线无产阶级革命派，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权后，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，在革命和生产方面都取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。全省工业交通战线的各个系统，到处热气腾腾，革命和生产形势越来越好。
    一月中旬以来，在山西省的工业交通战线上，随着无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的节节胜利，生产形势一个月比一个月好。全省一月份工业总产值比去年同期显著上升，二月份比去年同期增长百分之九点三，三月份比二月份又有较大的增长。
    目前，山西省越来越多的厂矿企业的无产阶级革命派，遵照毛主席提出的实行革命的“三结合”的指示，在实行革命的大联合的基础上，正确地对待干部，团结群众的大多数，相继建立和健全了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，成立了领导革命和生产的两个班子。这是山西省工业交通战线抓好革命、促好生产的政治保证和组织保证。
    山西省不少工厂企业的无产阶级革命派，夺权以后改变了走资本主义道路当权派过去“生产指标挂帅”和“突出技术”等领导生产的错误方法，大力突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，坚持按毛主席的革命路线办事，使这些工厂企业面貌一新。煤炭系统的革命派在抓生产的时候，发动广大职工认真讨论了搞好生产和把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的关系，讨论了山西煤炭生产在全国国民经济中所占地位和作用。革命职工干劲倍增，迅速改变了煤炭生产的落后面貌。许多工业交通企业的无产阶级革命派，把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，大搞人的思想革命化，发扬广大群众的首创精神，出现了前所未有的大闹技术革新和大创生产新纪录的新气象。太原锅炉厂的革命派大搞思想革命化以后，百分之九十以上的技术人员都深入生产现场，加强同工人结合，提出了二十多项技术革新项目，对全面完成全厂一、二月份的生产计划起了重大作用。不少企业连续创造生产新纪录。太原第一热电厂发电量创造了十三年来没有过的新纪录；五一机器厂机器产量创造了五年来没有过的新纪录。
    许多企业的革命职工破除了不少束缚生产力发展的旧的规章制度，建立了有利于生产发展的新规章制度，加速了生产的发展。太原铁路分局革命职工粉碎了一些修正主义的规章制度，加强集体领导，实现了“互相合作，密切配合，联合作战”的新秩序，有力地促进了生产的发展。二月份全局完成的货运量比一月份提高百分之十六；三月份前半月，又天天超额完成装车计划。春耕物资的运输到三月中已完成全月任务的百分之六十五。
    人民解放军在关键的时刻来到工业交通企业，大力宣传毛泽东思想和党的政策，帮助无产阶级革命派组织生产，领导生产，是使得工业交通战线革命和生产形势越来越好的一个极重要的因素。当大同煤矿党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大刮经济主义黑风，煽动工人离开生产岗位，使生产陷于瘫痪的关键时刻，驻大同地区的人民解放军来到大同煤矿，指战员们深入矿井，深入采煤工作面，深入食堂宿舍，同工人们一起学习“老三篇”，启发工人的阶级觉悟，并大力宣传和贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使全矿生产迅速得到恢复。全力支援无产阶级革命派的山西地区的人民解放军，同工业战线的无产阶级革命派日日夜夜并肩战斗，克服了一个个的困难，夺取了革命、生产的双胜利，为社会主义革命和建设事业立下了新的功勋。
