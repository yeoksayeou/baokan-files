In response to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Longhai County, Fujian Province, have launched a high tide of spring plowing production. Revolutionary cadres in rural areas of the county have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, cast aside selfish thoughts, put down mental burdens, treated the masses correctly, treated themselves correctly, stood tall, and rushed to the front lines of spring plowing production, contributing their strength to firing the first shot in spring plowing production.

During a recent three-level cadre meeting in Longhai County, some cadres from production brigades discussed how they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, seized the "selfish" thoughts in their minds, discarded the "fear" and "grievance," firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Criticism from the masses is the greatest care for cadres

Chen Datie, secretary of the Kechang Brigade Party Branch, said: During the rural cultural revolution, community members posted big-character posters about me and criticized me several times in meetings. At that time, I couldn't understand it at all, and my thoughts were in turmoil. I thought: I was elected as a cadre by the community, I didn't do less work, I didn't take more work points, and I often got up early and stayed up late for work, but in the end, I still received criticism from the community! The more I thought about it, the more resentful I felt, and I had no enthusiasm for work.

To address my thoughts, I repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," deeply feeling that I was far from Chairman Mao's requirements for a Party member cadre.

Chairman Mao said: "Because we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings." He also said: "A house should be cleaned regularly, otherwise it will accumulate dust; a face should be washed regularly, otherwise it will be covered in dust. Our comrades' thoughts and our Party's work will also accumulate dust and need to be cleaned and washed." But I went against Chairman Mao's teachings. The community elected me as a cadre, which is a sign of their trust. Doing more work for the revolution and serving the community more is the responsibility of a Communist Party member. However, after being a cadre for a few years, I felt a bit important, I could take compliments, but I always felt uncomfortable when community members criticized me. Isn't this the style of an old society's official? We are revolutionary cadres of the Mao Zedong era. The community's criticism is not directed at me as a person, but at my wrong thoughts, cleaning the dust off my face, so I can do better in the revolution in the future. The community's criticism is the community's greatest support and care for us cadres. Once I understood this, everything became clear. On the one hand, I voluntarily checked my past work mistakes and shortcomings at the community meeting, humbly accepted the community's criticism and education. On the other hand, I joined forces with the revolutionary faction in the brigade to actively lead the community members in a big spring production drive. Community members said: As long as you are determined to correct your mistakes and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will jointly make the revolution, work together to produce, and fire the first shot in spring plowing production.

As long as cadres stand up for the revolution, the masses will support them

Zheng Yongyuan, secretary of the Cuilin Brigade Party Branch, said: In this cultural revolution, many of our cadres were posted big-character posters by the community. Some people felt that they had lost face, thinking that the community no longer believed in them, that their words were no longer listened to, and thus let work go and even gave up. This is a wrong attitude of not believing in the community and not believing in the Party. The problem is not whether the community believes in us, but whether we cadres truly want to make the revolution, truly show our "face" to the community, truly draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As long as we truly do this, the community will welcome us, support us, and trust us.

Not long after the cultural revolution began, my mental burden was also very heavy. I thought, I've only been a cadre for less than five months, and I've already been criticized by the community so many times. What face do I have to see people in the future? What authority do I have? Every morning when I went to work, I didn't blow the whistle to call everyone, I just carried my hoe and ran to the field. When working, I just buried my head and worked, not daring to talk to others. I knew in my heart that this was not right, but sometimes I wanted to work hard, but I was afraid the community would say I was just putting on a show, and I felt really suffocated.

What should I do? I opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao said: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can't do anything." Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction for me. I thought, if I produced negative and resistant emotions after "eating" a few big-character posters, this is a wrong attitude of not believing in the community and not believing in the Party. I must correct my attitude, cast aside selfish thoughts, and bravely stand up. Therefore, I resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instruction: "You should put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the cultural revolution of the proletariat even better," and on the one hand, actively participated in the movement, and on the other hand, seriously led production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and encouraged me, saying: You had shortcomings and mistakes in the past, which can't be entirely blamed on you, we also have responsibility, we didn't help you enough. Now that you can seriously check and correct your mistakes, that's good! The attitude of the poor and lower-middle peasants moved me greatly. In production, the community had problems and all came to me for advice. I proposed the suggestion of carrying river fertilizer based on the situation of the field lacking fertilizer, and the community members enthusiastically agreed, and in a few days, they accumulated more than 5,000 loads of river mud fertilizer. The actions of the community gave me a great education. This shows that as long as we believe in the community and rely on the community, and correct our mistakes, the poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely understand us; as long as we stand tall and boldly lead production, the poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely trust us and support us.

Always listen to Chairman Mao's words, remember the bitterness of the class

Gao Axian, deputy secretary of the Gaokeng Brigade Party Branch, said: In the busy spring plowing production, I was able to stand tall and boldly lead production, all because I listened to Chairman Mao's words and did not forget the bitterness of the class.

At first, I was criticized by community members several times at criticism meetings, and my thoughts were not clear, feeling that the community only knew how to pick on things, and being a cadre was a "loss." Plus, some bad people incited me, and I hardened my heart and gave up.

Those few days at night, I lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. I thought, fish rely on water, babies rely on their mothers, we poor and lower-middle peasants rely on Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. It is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that liberated me from the landlord's whip; it is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that led us poor people to revolt, distributing land and houses; it is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that taught me some revolutionary principles, allowing me to join the Communist Party of China; it is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that cultivated me, who was looked down upon by everyone in the old society, into a cadre. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, I was extremely sad! I have let down Chairman Mao. A Communist Party member who does not work for the revolution and for the community is not a Communist Party member at all! We poor and lower-middle peasants do not make the revolution, do not seize power, and let who make the revolution? Let who seize power? If I give up, isn't this letting the class enemy laugh at us poor and lower-middle peasants, isn't this falling into their plots to sabotage production and wreck the cultural revolution? Thinking of this, I could no longer lie down. That night, I ran to the brigade office, checked my mistakes of giving up for a few days, and expressed my determination to stand tall and "rush" to the front lines of spring plowing production, to build new merits and new labor in spring plowing production, and to make up for my mistakes. The next day, the revolutionary faction actively led the way to the fields, quickly launching a magnificent high tide of spring plowing production.

Revolution cannot have the slightest selfishness

Zheng Liuyan, brigade leader of the Yangxi Brigade, said: The most profound lesson I learned from this cultural revolution is that revolution cannot have the slightest selfishness. Those with selfishness will have the word "fear" in their minds, fearing loss, fearing to lose face, thinking only of themselves. Only without selfishness can one do revolutionary work well and carry the revolution through to the end. In the early stages of the movement, influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line, I did not understand the rural cultural revolution, always fearing that the flames of the movement would burn me, and only focused on production, grinding my teeth and turning circles with the community. However, the flames of revolution are unstoppable. At a meeting to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary faction clearly pointed out to me: You fear the movement for the sake of protecting yourself, but in reality, you are not protecting just yourself, but a bourgeois reactionary line. This made me realize with a shock that my selfishness was too heavy.

Later, the busy spring plowing season arrived. At this time, although I also wanted to lead the spring plowing production well, I was still worried that the community would say I was focusing on production, suppressing the revolution, and that this was a new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. With this conflicting mood, I repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the editorial of the _Red Flag_ magazine

### 龙海县生产大队干部畅谈活学活用毛主席著作体会  破私立公大胆领导春耕生产

    龙海县生产大队干部畅谈活学活用毛主席著作体会
    破私立公大胆领导春耕生产
    新华社福州十三日电　在广大贫下中农积极响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，掀起春耕生产的高潮中，福建省龙海县农村广大革命干部遵照毛主席的教导，排除私心杂念，放下思想包袱，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，挺起腰板，“杀”上春耕生产第一线，为打响春耕生产第一炮贡献了自己的力量。
    在龙海县最近召开的三级干部会议期间，一部分生产大队干部座谈了他们怎样活学活用毛主席著作，狠夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，丢掉“怕”字，去掉“怨”字，坚定地站到毛主席的革命路线一边，同广大贫下中农并肩战斗的体会。
        群众批评是对干部的最大爱护
    课堂大队支部书记陈打铁说：在农村无产阶级文化大革命中，社员给我贴了一些大字报，还开会批判了我几次。那时，我怎么也想不通，思想斗争很激烈，心想：我这干部是大家选的，劳动没少干，工分没多拿，为了工作经常起早贪黑，结果还落得群众批评！我越想怨气越大，干工作就没有劲头了。
    针对自己的思想，我反复学习了“老三篇”，深深感到自己距离毛主席对一个党员干部的要求太远了。
    毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”又说：“房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会沾染灰尘的，也应该打扫和洗涤。”而我哩，却违背了毛主席的教导。群众选我当干部，是对我的信任。为革命多做点工作，为群众多服务一些，是一个共产党员应尽的责任。但是，我当了几年干部，就觉得有点了不起，好话听得进，社员批评一下总感到刺耳，这不就是旧社会官老爷的作风吗？
    我们是毛泽东时代的革命干部。群众的批评，不是对我这个人，而是对我的错误思想，给我洗去脸上的灰尘，让我今后能更好地干革命。群众的批评，是群众对我们干部的最大支持，最大爱护。思想通了，一通百通。我一方面在社员大会上主动检查自己过去工作中的缺点、错误，虚心接受群众的批评教育，同时又和队里的革命派结合起来，积极领导社员群众大搞春季生产。社员群众都说：只要你决心改正错误，站到毛主席的革命路线上来，咱们就共同闹革命，合力搞生产，打响春耕生产第一炮。
    只要干部站出来革命，群众就会支持
    翠林大队党支部书记郑永源说：在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们不少干部被群众贴了大字报。有的人就觉得面子上下不来，认为群众再不相信自己了，说话没人听了，于是对工作放任自流，甚至撒手不管。这是一种不相信群众，不相信党的错误态度。其实，问题不在于群众相信不相信我们，而在于我们干部是否真正要革命，真正把“相”亮给群众，真正同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线彻底划清界限，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。只要真正这样做了，群众就会欢迎你，支持你，信任你。
    文化大革命开始不久，我的思想包袱也是很重的。心想，当干部还不到五个月，就挨了群众这么多批评，今后还有啥脸见人？还有啥威信？每天早上出工，我也不吹哨子招呼大家了，只管自己扛着锄头往地里跑。劳动的时候，我一个人埋着头干，不好意思和别人搭话。自己心里也知道这样做说不过去，有时想好好干吧，又怕群众说我是装样子，心里真是憋得慌。
    怎么办呢？我打开了红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》。毛主席说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”毛主席的话给我指明了前进的方向。我想，“吃”了几张大字报就产生消极抵触情绪，这就是不相信群众、不相信党的错误态度。我一定要端正态度，去掉私心杂念，勇敢地站起来。于是，我坚决遵照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的指示，一方面积极参加运动，一方面认真领导生产。广大贫下中农看我这样，便鼓励我说：你过去有缺点错误，不能光怪你，我们也有责任，帮助你不够。现在你能够认真检查，改正错误，那就很好嘛！贫下中农的态度，使我十分感动。在生产中，群众有什么问题，也都找我商量。我根据田里缺肥的情况提出了挑河肥的建议，社员群众热烈赞同，几天工夫就积了河泥肥五千多担。群众的行动，使我受到很大教育。这说明只要相信群众，依靠群众，有了错误就改正，贫下中农就一定会谅解我们；只要我们挺起腰板，大胆领导生产，贫下中农就一定会信任我们，支持我们。
      永远听毛主席的话，牢记阶级苦
    高坑大队党支部副书记高阿祥说：在春耕生产大忙中，我所以能挺起腰板，大胆领导生产，这全是因为听了毛主席的话，没有忘记阶级苦。
    起初，我被社员群众在批判会上点了几次名，思想上很不通，觉得群众专会挑刺儿，当干部就是“吃亏”。再加上坏人一煽动，我心一横，就撒手不干了。
    那几天夜里，我躺在床上，总是翻来复去睡不着。我想，鱼儿靠水，婴儿靠娘，我们贫下中农靠的是毛主席和共产党。是毛主席和共产党，把我从地主的皮鞭下解放了出来；是毛主席和共产党，领导我们穷人闹翻身，分得了土地和住房；是毛主席和共产党，教育我懂得了点革命道理，加入了中国共产党；是毛主席和共产党，培养我这个在旧社会谁都瞧不起的
  “土包子”，也当上了干部。想想过去，看看眼前，我心里难过极了！我对不起毛主席他老人家，是我忘了本。一个共产党员不为革命出力，不为群众工作，还算得什么共产党员？我们贫下中农不干革命，不掌权，又让谁干？让谁掌权？我撒手不干，不正是让阶级敌人看我们贫下中农的笑话，不正是中了他们破坏生产、搞垮文化大革命的阴谋诡计吗？想到这里，我再也躺不下去了。当天晚上，我就跑到队部办公室，向大家检讨这几天撒手不干的错误，并且表示要挺起腰板“杀”上春耕生产第一线，在春耕生产中建新功、立新劳，将功补过。第二天革命派积极带头下地，很快掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮。
        干革命不能有半点私心
    洋西大队大队长郑流涎说：这次文化大革命给我教育最深刻的一点，就是干革命不能有半点私心。有私心的人，就会怕字当头，怕吃亏，怕丢面子，想的尽是自己。只有无私，才能把革命工作干好，把革命进行到底。运动初期，由于受到资产阶级反动路线的影响，我对农村文化大革命很不理解，总怕运动的烈火烧到自己头上，尽在生产上同群众磨牙转圈。但是，革命的烈火是压不住的。在一次揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的大会上，革命派明确地向我指出：你为了保自己，对运动怕字当头，但实际上你保的不是你一个人，而是一条资产阶级反动路线。这才使我大吃一惊，醒悟过来，认识到我的私心太重了。
    后来，春耕大忙季节来到了。这时，虽然我也想领导好春耕生产，但又担心群众说我是抓生产，压革命，是资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。带着这种矛盾的心情，我反复学习了“老三篇”和《红旗》杂志社论，这才认识到自己所以没有勇气大胆地去领导生产，又是私字在脑子里作怪。
    我反复地体会了毛主席他老人家提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，又一遍遍地读了毛主席的教导：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。这样，我才逐渐地踢开私字，既和革命派一起闹革命，又挺起腰杆来领导春耕生产。在领导生产中，群众给了我最大的支持，这就更使我深深感到用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众最听毛主席的话，最能坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策。于是，我进一步解除了顾虑，工作起来更加大胆了。
