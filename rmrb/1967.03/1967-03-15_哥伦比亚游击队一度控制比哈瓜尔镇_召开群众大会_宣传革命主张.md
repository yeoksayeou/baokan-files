A 200-strong guerrilla force of the Colombian National Liberation Army attacked a police station in Bihagual town near Baranacavimeja in the province of Santander on February 27, killing five policemen and wounding three.

The attack was carried out by fighters of the "Camilo Torres Guerrilla Front" of the National Liberation Army.

According to reports, when the National Liberation Army fighters entered Bihagual town, they encountered resistance from the police and a battle ensued. After eliminating the police, the guerrillas took control of the entire town and convened a meeting of the residents to propagate the National Liberation Army's platform. After the meeting, they posted numerous revolutionary slogans around the town. Two hours later, the guerrillas withdrew from Bihagual town.

According to reports, during their stay, the guerrillas were very friendly with the residents. When guerrillas drank water in some shops, the shopkeepers refused to take payment, but the guerrillas insisted on paying the full amount.

Currently, the Bihagual battle has had a significant political impact within Colombia, particularly as a heavy blow to the reactionary ruling clique. There are reports that Colombians frequently discuss the combat effectiveness of the National Liberation Army guerrillas, as well as the clear signs of their growth and strengthening.

    哥伦比亚游击队一度控制比哈瓜尔镇
    召开群众大会　宣传革命主张
    本报讯　哥伦比亚民族解放军的一支二百人的游击队，二月二十七日在桑坦德省袭击了巴兰卡维梅哈附近比哈瓜尔镇的一个警察所，打死警察五人，打伤三人。
    这次袭击是由民族解放军的“卡米洛·托雷斯游击战线”的战士进行的。
    据报道，民族解放军的战士进入比哈瓜尔镇时，遇到警察的抵抗，发生了一场战斗。在消灭了警察之后，游击队控制了整个镇的局势，并召开了居民大会，宣传了民族解放军的主张。会后还在镇上张贴了大批宣传革命的标语。两小时后，游击队撤出了比哈瓜尔镇。
    据报道，游击队在逗留期间，同居民亲如手足。游击队战士在一些店铺喝水时，店主拒绝收费，但游击战士还是照付了全部费用。
    目前，比哈瓜尔战斗在哥伦比亚国内产生了巨大的政治影响，特别是对反动统治集团是一次沉重的打击。有报道说，现在哥伦比亚人们经常议论民族解放军游击队的战斗力，及其兴旺和发展壮大的明显迹象。
