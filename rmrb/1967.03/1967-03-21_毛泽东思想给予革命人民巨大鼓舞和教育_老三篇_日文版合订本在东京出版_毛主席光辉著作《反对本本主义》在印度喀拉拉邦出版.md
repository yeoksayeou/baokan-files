Mao Zedong Thought has given great inspiration and education to revolutionary people. The combined edition of the "Three Articles" in Japanese was published in Tokyo. Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Oppose Book Worship" was published in Kerala State, India.

New China News Agency, Tokyo, March 18 - The combined edition of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Three Articles" in Japanese was published and distributed by the China Bookstore in Tokyo on March 16. It was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of Japan. Workers, students, and office workers all rushed to buy the combined edition of the "Three Articles." Some readers bought more than twenty copies at a time. They regard the "Three Articles" as the most precious gift and send them to their relatives and friends.

Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Three Articles" has given great inspiration and education to Japanese readers.

A Japanese Esperanto worker, Sakai Matsutarō, said, "The 'Three Articles' are powerful weapons for transforming thoughts. Only by studying and applying the 'Three Articles' can one truly master the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He said he has read the "Three Articles" more than twenty times, and each time he gains new inspiration and strength.

A female activist named Kanda Sachiko said, "Such brilliant works as the 'Three Articles' must be studied and applied repeatedly. Although the 'Three Articles' are short, they are full of truth. One must take the 'Three Articles' as a motto for transforming thoughts." She also said that only through the practice of struggle can one truly understand the teachings of the "Three Articles" on serving the people.

Participants in the recently held 16th Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) praised the "Three Articles" as a required course for transforming thoughts. They believe that the brilliant thought of breaking private interests and establishing public interests expressed in the "Three Articles" has become the guiding principle for activists dedicated to the Japan-China friendship movement.

Many representatives pointed out in their speeches that the great and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has become the guiding principle for the actions of 700 million Chinese people and is also the guiding ideology for promoting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.
