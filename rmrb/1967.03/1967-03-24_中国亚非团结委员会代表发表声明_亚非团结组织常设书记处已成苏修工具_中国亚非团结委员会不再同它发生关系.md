	The representative of the Chinese Committee of Solidarity with Asian and African Peoples, Liang Gong, issued a statement on March 21 in Cairo, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists' manipulation of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian and African Peoples Solidarity Organization in Cairo to engage in despicable activities. He solemnly declared that he would no longer have any relations with this Secretariat.

	The statement said: "In recent years, Soviet revisionists have shamelessly manipulated the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian and African Peoples Solidarity Organization in Cairo, arbitrarily suppressing the correct suggestions made by the secretaries of various countries who uphold the revolutionary line of unity and anti-imperialism, and stifling the just voices of the Asian and African peoples. It is under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists that the Permanent Secretariat illegally decided to hold the so-called Eighth Session of the Asian and African Solidarity Conference in Nicosia, thereby casting aside the correct resolution passed at the Winnipeg Conference regarding the holding of the Fifth Asian and African Peoples Solidarity Conference in Beijing in 1967... After the illegal and divisive session in Nicosia, the Permanent Secretariat is now making every effort to implement the illegal decisions passed at the infamous Nicosia conference."

	The statement pointed out: "The facts show that the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian and African Peoples Solidarity Organization has degenerated into a tool of the Soviet revisionists and will inevitably slide down the road of following the counter-revolutionary line of the Soviet revisionists. Therefore, the Chinese Committee of Solidarity with Asian and African Peoples announced on March 17, 1967, that it would no longer have any relations with this Permanent Secretariat."

	The statement reaffirmed the Chinese Committee of Solidarity with Asian and African Peoples' firm resolve to hold the Fifth Asian and African Peoples Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year. It also warmly welcomed the birth of a new, revolutionary Asian and African peoples' solidarity movement that truly reflects the aspirations of the Asian and African peoples.

    中国亚非团结委员会代表发表声明
    亚非团结组织常设书记处已成苏修工具
    中国亚非团结委员会不再同它发生关系
    新华社开罗二十二日电　中国亚非团结委员会代表梁耕二十一日在这里发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者操纵开罗亚非人民团结组织常设书记处进行卑鄙的活动，并且严正宣布他不再同这个书记处发生任何关系。
    声明说：“近几年来，苏联修正主义者肆无忌惮地操纵在开罗的亚非人民团结组织常设书记处，专横地压制维护团结反帝的革命路线的各国书记提出的正确建议，抑制亚非人民的正义呼声。正是在苏联修正主义者操纵下，常设书记处非法决定在尼科西亚召开所谓的第八届亚非团结理事会会议，从而把在温尼巴大会上通过的关于一九六七年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会的正确决议抛在一边……在非法的分裂性的尼科西亚理事会会议之后，常设书记处现在正在竭力进行活动，以执行在臭名远扬的尼科西亚会议上通过的非法决定。”
    声明指出：“种种事实表明，亚非人民团结组织常设书记处已经堕落成为苏修的工具，它必将沿着追随苏修反革命路线的道路滑下去。因此，中国亚非团结委员会在一九六七年三月十七日宣布今后不再同这个常设书记处发生任何关系。”
    声明重申中国亚非团结委员会今年将在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会的坚定决心，并且热烈欢呼真正反映亚非人民愿望的崭新的革命的亚非人民团结运动的诞生。
