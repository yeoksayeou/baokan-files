Recently, the leading cadres of a certain radar regiment of the Air Force, in order to better implement Chairman Mao's instructions on the military's involvement in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and support for the broad masses of the left, held a discussion on their study of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The discussion unanimously agreed that strictly distinguishing and correctly handling the two types of contradictions of different natures, in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, is an important prerequisite for correctly implementing the Party's cadre policy advocated by Chairman Mao.

The proletarian revolutionary faction realizes "three-in-one combination" and carries out the struggle for power, distinguishing between enemies and ourselves is a very important issue. We must seriously act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions of different natures, correctly implement the Party's cadre policy, win over and unite the majority, and thoroughly isolate and strike at a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

Deputy Commander Wang Tiehua said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." The proletarian revolutionary faction realizes "three-in-one combination" and carries out the struggle for power, distinguishing between enemies and ourselves is a very important issue. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party use the tactic of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag and play both sides. When the revolutionary masses tear off their masks, they madly carry out white terror, labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and deliberately spreading fallacies such as "automatic red" to confuse the revolutionary ranks. After their conspiracies are exposed, they launch sugar-coated bullets and engage in economism. Now, at this critical moment of "three-in-one combination" and seizure of power, they are still playing various tricks. Chairman Mao teaches us to be good at distinguishing between the two types of contradictions of different natures, which gives us a precious ideological weapon. As long as we strictly act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, no matter how cunning the enemy is, they will not be able to deceive us.

Political Commissar Wang Gengcheng said: Chairman Mao has always been good at using the perspective of class struggle and the method of class analysis to analyze various social forces, formulate policies and strategies for struggle, and unite all those who can be united, so that the Chinese revolution can continuously achieve victory. In the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao scientifically analyzes the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in the socialist period, creatively develops Marxism-Leninism, and lays the theoretical foundation for us to formulate policies and strategies in the socialist period. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only when the Party's policies and strategies are all on the right track can the Chinese revolution have the possibility of victory." Only by following Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly solving the current struggle's policy and strategy issues, can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieve thorough victory. The struggles for power in Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Shanghai, and Guizhou have set an example for the whole country. One of their most important experiences is that they have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, correctly identified and treated cadres, and thus united the broad masses of cadres and the people, forming a mighty revolutionary army, and thoroughly isolating the class enemies. Therefore, we must strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, neither treating enemy contradictions as contradictions among the people nor treating contradictions among the people as enemy contradictions. Only in this way can we win over and unite the majority and concentrate our efforts on striking at a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

"Punish the past to prevent the future, cure the sickness to save the person" is the Party's traditional policy. We must follow the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to help cadres correct their mistakes. If cadres make mistakes, hitting them with one stick and killing them is not in line with Chairman Mao's consistent teachings to us.

Regimental Commander Feng Chenglou said: "Punish the past to prevent the future, cure the sickness to save the person" is the Party's traditional policy, which is diametrically opposed to the "ruthless struggle, merciless blows" adopted by the "left" opportunists. "Be lenient to ourselves and harsh to the enemy" is the clear stance of our proletarian revolutionary faction. For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must resolutely overthrow them; for all those who want revolution and are willing to correct their mistakes, we should follow the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," giving them patient education and help.

During the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, why did the Japanese imperialists "fear the Eighth Route Army's large-scale training but not the Eighth Route Army's large-scale rectification"? It was because rectification brought about unity in our ranks. Unity is strength, which is unmatched by any gun. I remember that before the rectification movement in my unit at that time, there were many shortcomings, and some leaders had the mentality of localism, not wanting to transfer people or guns; after the rectification movement of criticism and education, awareness was raised, the unit was more united, and combat effectiveness was enhanced. Later, the "three inspections and three rectifications" during the War of Liberation and the whole Party rectification in 1957 were the same, bringing about great development in the revolutionary cause. Therefore, whether to use the correct method to handle contradictions among the people is a principle issue, a major issue related to the success or failure of the revolutionary cause.

Deputy Political Commissar Li Shuchun said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in essence, is a great revolution in ideology and will inevitably touch the soul of each individual. Chairman Mao said: "All ideological issues, all issues of debate among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive and subjugating methods." We must believe that the vast majority of cadres are revolutionary, and believe in the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought; in this way, we can unite with all those who want revolution.

Logistics Director Li Defu said: If a mistake is made, hitting them with one stick and killing them is not allowing revolution, right? This way of doing things is not in line with Chairman Mao's consistent teachings to us. We should not despise those who make mistakes but believe that the vast majority of them will correct their mistakes. Criticizing them and fighting with them as necessary is to unite them to do revolution together.

Revolution not only means overthrowing the enemy but also overthrowing the "self" in one's mind. "Public" is the proletarian command center in one's mind, and "private" is the bourgeois command center in one's mind. When "public" defeats "private," a person is commanded by the proletarian command center; when "private" defeats "public," a person is commanded by the bourgeois command center.

Deputy Political Commissar Wang Xiaoyu said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." The bourgeois worldview boils down to one word: "self." Those who do "revolution" with selfish motives will have increasingly heavy selfish motives. They compete for fame and profit and seek to make a name for themselves. Once they have power, they may become capitalist-roaders. True revolutionaries are always open-hearted, daring to overthrow the "self," and no matter what position they are in, they are just "ordinary soldiers" and "servants of the people," never changing color. From this, we can see that "public" is the proletarian command center in one's mind, and "private" is the bourgeois command center in one's mind. When "public" defeats "private," a person is commanded by the proletarian command center; when "private" defeats "public," a person is commanded by the bourgeois command center. Vice Chairman Lin Biao instructs us, "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as the object of revolution." We must bombard the bourgeois command center in our minds. In the past, we lacked understanding of ideological remolding, thinking that not committing major mistakes was enough, which was being a "conservative" in ideological remolding. The editorial in the third issue of the Red Flag magazine points out: "In the struggle for power and after taking power, everyone will face new tests." Will we continue to be revolutionaries or turn into "conservatives"? The key lies in whether we overthrow or preserve the "self."

To truly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview is the most basic condition for maintaining revolutionary youth.

Deputy Chief of Staff Ye Guixiang said: The fundamental issue is whether we can truly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview. To maintain revolutionary youth, this is the most basic condition. Some people joined the revolutionary ranks at the age of ten or twenty and became careerists, conspirators, and counter-revolutionary revisionists in their later years. Why? Fundamentally, it is because they did not possess this most basic condition.

Everyone is bound to make mistakes, but as long as they have a sincere attitude, mistakes can be turned into lessons and become the starting point for progress.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a broad and deep ideological revolution. To carry this revolution to the end, we must touch the soul of each individual, thoroughly criticize the "self" in one's mind, and if the selfish motives are not thoroughly criticized, the root of capitalist restoration will not be thoroughly uprooted. Therefore, every revolutionary comrade must consciously transform their thoughts, overthrow the enemy, and also overthrow oneself. Chairman Mao said: "Without the correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." In this cultural revolution, we must transform the old soul, and to do so, we must truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

    严格区分两类矛盾是正确对待干部的重要前提
    空军某雷达团领导干部学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的体会
    最近，空军某雷达团的领导干部，为了更好地执行毛主席关于军队要介入无产阶级文化大革命、支持左派广大群众的指示，他们座谈了学习毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的体会。座谈中一致认为，按照毛泽东思想严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，是正确地贯彻执行毛主席一贯提倡的党的干部政策的重要前提。
    无产阶级革命派实现“三结合”，进行夺权斗争，分清敌我是一个极为重要的问题。要认真按照毛主席的教导办事，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确地执行党的干部政策，争取和团结大多数，彻底孤立和打击一小撮反党反社会主义分子。
    参谋长王铁华说：毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”无产阶级革命派实现“三结合”，进行夺权斗争，分清敌我是一个极为重要的问题。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们惯用的手法是打着“红旗”反红旗，耍两面派。当革命群众撕开了他们的画皮，他们便疯狂地实行白色恐怖，把革命群众打成“反革命”，并且故意散布什么“自来红”等谬论，来搅乱革命阵线。当他们的这些阴谋被戳穿以后，他们又放出糖衣炮弹，大搞经济主义。现在，在“三结合”夺权的关键时刻，他们还在继续玩弄种种花招。毛主席教导我们，要善于区分两类不同性质的矛盾，这给了我们宝贵的思想武器。只要我们严格地按照毛主席的教导办事，无论多么狡猾的敌人也休想蒙混过关。
    政委王更琛说：毛主席历来最善于用阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析的方法来分析各种社会力量，制定斗争的政策和策略，把一切可以团结的人都团结起来，使我国革命能够不断地取得胜利。在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中，毛主席对社会主义时期的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争作了科学的分析，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，为我们在社会主义时期制定政策和策略奠定了理论基础。毛主席教导我们：“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”只有按照毛主席的指示，正确地解决当前斗争的政策和策略问题，无产阶级文化大革命才能取得彻底的胜利。黑龙江、山西、上海、贵州等地的夺权斗争，给全国树立了典范。他们的一条极为重要的经验，就是认真地贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，正确地识别和对待干部，因而团结了广大的干部和群众，结成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把阶级敌人彻底地孤立起来。因此，我们一定要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，既不能把敌我矛盾当成人民内部矛盾，也不能把人民内部矛盾当成敌我矛盾，这样，才有利于争取和团结大多数，集中力量打击一小撮反党反社会主义分子。
    “惩前毖后、治病救人”，是党的传统政策。一定要按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式帮助干部改正错误。如果干部犯了错误，就一棍子打死，这就不符合毛主席一贯对我们的教导。
    团长冯成楼说：“惩前毖后、治病救人”是党的传统政策，同“左”倾机会主义者所采取的“残酷斗争，无情打击”是针锋相对的。“对己和，对敌狠”，这是我们无产阶级革命派的鲜明立场。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，要坚决打倒；对于一切要革命的、犯错误而愿意改正的同志，则应根据“团结——批评——团结”的方针，给以耐心的教育和帮助。
    在抗日战争的艰苦年代，日本帝国主义为什么“不怕八路军大练兵，只怕八路军大整风”呢？就是因为整风带来了我们队伍的团结。团结就是力量，是任何枪炮都不可以比拟的。记得我当时所在的部队，整风以前也有不少缺点，有些领导人有山头主义思想，调人调不动，调枪不愿给；经过整风运动进行批评教育，觉悟更加提高了，部队更加团结了，战斗力增强了。以后，解放战争时期的“三查三整”，一九五七年的全党整风都是这样，带来了革命事业的大发展。所以，是不是用正确的方法处理人民内部矛盾，是一个原则问题，是关系到革命事业成败的大问题。
    政治处主任李树春说：无产阶级文化大革命，从本质上讲是一场思想革命，必定要触及每个人的灵魂。毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”我们要相信干部的绝大多数是要革命的，要相信毛泽东思想的无比巨大的威力；这样，我们就能和一切愿意革命的人联合起来。
    后勤处长李德富说：如果犯了错误，就一棍子打死，不就是不准革命吗？这样作，是不符合毛主席一贯对我们的教导的。对待犯错误的同志，我们不能厌弃他们，要相信他们中间的绝大多数是会改正错误的。批评他们，和他们作必要的斗争，是为了团结他们更好地一道干革命。
    革命，不但要革敌人的命，也要革自己头脑中“私”字的命。“公”是头脑中的无产阶级司令部，“私”是头脑中的资产阶级司令部。“公”战胜了“私”，人就受无产阶级司令部指挥；“私”战胜了“公”，人就受资产阶级司令部指挥。
    政治处副主任王肖禹说：毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”资产阶级世界观集中到一点，就是一个“私”字。带着私心干“革命”的人，私心会越来越重。平时争名利，争出风头，一旦有了权，就可能变成走资本主义道路的当权派。而真正的革命者总是襟怀坦白，敢于革“私”字的命，不论在什么样的岗位上，都是一个“普通战士”，都是“人民的勤务员”，永远不变颜色。由此可见，“公”是头脑中的无产阶级司令部，“私”是头脑中的资产阶级司令部。“公”战胜了“私”，人就受无产阶级司令部指挥；“私”战胜了“公”，人就受资产阶级司令部指挥。林彪副主席指示我们，“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”我们就是要炮打自己头脑中的资产阶级司令部。过去对思想改造认识不足，以为不犯大错误就行了，这是在思想改造上当了“保”字派。《红旗》杂志第三期社论指出：“每个人在夺权斗争中和当权以后，都要经受新的考验。”是继续当革命派还是转化为“保”字派？关键就在于对“私”字是革还是保。
    真正做到读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，是永葆革命青春的最基本的条件。
    副参谋长叶桂祥说：根本的问题是能否真正做到读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的世界观。要永葆革命青春，这是最基本的条件。有的人十几岁参加革命队伍，到晚年成了野心家、阴谋家、反革命修正主义分子。为什么？从根本上说，就是他们没有具备这个最基本的条件。
    任何人总是难免要犯错误的，只要有个老老实实的态度，错误可以变为教训，成为进步的起点。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场广泛深入的思想大革命。要把这场大革命进行到底，就要触及每个人的灵魂，大造头脑中“私”字的反，不把私心彻底反掉，资本主义复辟的根子就没有彻底挖掉。因此，每个革命同志都要自觉地改造思想，革敌人的命，也革自己的命。毛主席说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”在这场文化大革命中，我们要改造旧的灵魂，就要真正掌握毛泽东思想。
