The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front recently held its 13th enlarged meeting. The meeting adopted a resolution calling on all military and civilian personnel in Vietnam to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call, strengthen unity, and highly carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism. They must overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, concentrate all efforts to defeat the American aggressors, and determine to achieve new victories with new efforts.

Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Ton Duc Thang, delivered the opening speech. He warmly praised the great victories achieved by the military and civilian personnel in North and South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation war.

Ton Duc Thang pointed out: "The U.S. aggressors are now in a desperate situation, but they are more ferocious and cunning. The practice of the anti-American national salvation war over the past few years has proven that the material strength of U.S. imperialism cannot intimidate a nation that has never yielded to any foreign invaders—the heroic Vietnamese people. If the American aggressors continue to use weapons to talk to us, we are ready at any time to give them the punishment they deserve on all battlefields."

Ton Duc Thang called on all military and civilian personnel in Vietnam to unite as one, fear no hardships, fear no sacrifices, and resolutely defeat the American aggressors.

Huynh Tan Phat, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, made a report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. He pointed out that the heroic military and civilian personnel in South Vietnam continue to maintain and exercise the initiative, have won the first round of the U.S. imperialist's limited war, and achieved brilliant results; the military and civilian personnel in the North are fighting well and producing well, have shattered the air superiority of the American aggressors, and completed the task of the great rear supporting the great front.

After exposing the new conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to expand the war of aggression in South Vietnam and strengthen the attacks on North Vietnam, Huynh Tan Phat said that the current task of the Vietnam Fatherland Front is to strengthen the unity within the people, arouse the patriotic enthusiasm and love for socialism of the people, highly carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, and be determined to defeat the American aggressors in any situation. He finally affirmed that the Vietnamese people will surely win, and U.S. imperialism will surely fail.

Nguyen Van Tho, head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in North Vietnam, also spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, assured the people of North Vietnam that no matter how much hardship and sacrifice they have to endure, the people of the South will surely fulfill the sacred mission entrusted by the nation, that is, to defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country.

The Vietnam People's Army newspaper published an editorial on March 10th regarding the 13th enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, stating, "We must use weapons to give the arrogant war provocations and blackmail of the U.S. war-mongering clique a proper response."

The editorial pointed out that the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people is currently at a fierce stage. The U.S. aggressors are frantically intensifying the war. All military and civilian personnel in Vietnam resolutely respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call to resist America and save the nation, implement the resolution of the 13th meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, strengthen unity, highly carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, and give U.S. imperialism heavier blows, smash all its aggressive conspiracies, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country.

    黄国越在揭露美帝国主义扩大侵略越南南方的战争，加强袭击越南北方的新阴谋以后说，越南祖国战线目前的任务是：增强人民内部的团结一致，激发人民的爱国热情和对社会主义的热爱，高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，在任何情况下都要决心战胜美国侵略强盗。他最后肯定指出，越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进也应邀在会上讲了话。他代表一千四百万越南南方人民向越南北方人民保证：不管要忍受多少艰苦牺牲，南方人民决心完成民族交给的神圣义务，即战胜美帝国主义的侵略战争，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    新华社河内十日电　越南《人民报》十日就越南祖国战线中央委员会举行第十三次扩大会议发表社论说，“我们必须用武器来给美国好战集团的横蛮的战争挑衅和讹诈以应有的回答。”
    社论指出，越南人民的抗美救国战斗目前正处于激烈的阶段。美国侵略者正在疯狂地加强战争。越南全体军民坚决响应胡志明主席的抗美救国神圣号召，实现越南祖国战线中央委员会第十三次会议的决议，加强团结，高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，给予美帝国主义以更沉重的打击，粉碎它的一切侵略阴谋，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
