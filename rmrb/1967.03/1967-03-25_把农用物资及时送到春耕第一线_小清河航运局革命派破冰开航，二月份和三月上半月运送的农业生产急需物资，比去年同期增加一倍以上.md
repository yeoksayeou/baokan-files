The Xiaoqinghe Navigation Bureau's revolutionary faction has broken the ice and started navigation, delivering more than double the amount of urgently needed agricultural production materials in February and the first half of March compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 23rd -- The Xiaoqinghe Navigation Bureau in Shandong Province delivered more than double the amount of materials to the frontlines of spring plowing in February and the first half of March this year compared to the same period last year. This achievement is a result of the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction, who, with the urgency of "seizing every moment," broke the ice and started navigation, providing strong support for agriculture.

Previously, under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the production management department of the Xiaoqinghe Navigation Bureau emphasized only the completion of ton-kilometer indicators. Consequently, each tugboat team, in order to achieve more ton-kilometers, preferred long-distance routes and avoided short-distance ones; they preferred to transport easily loadable materials and avoided scattered and difficult-to-load materials. Now, the revolutionary faction has formulated plans that prioritize politics, breaking away from the old frameworks. They have prioritized the urgent materials needed for current agricultural production in the transportation plan and stipulated that materials will be transported as soon as they arrive, regardless of the quantity. They do not discriminate based on the type of material or the distance of the route. They have also established a consignment agency service. As long as a village sends a letter requesting the purchase of something from Jinan, they will handle the consignment and deliver it to the doorstep, taking full responsibility.

To ensure that various materials supporting agriculture are delivered to the frontlines of spring plowing as early as possible, as soon as the river opened, the revolutionary crew members broke the ice and started navigation, sailing day and night. As soon as the ship arrived at the port, they assisted the loading and unloading workers in handling the materials. With the ice just beginning to thaw, in places where the water level is low and the navigation channel has many bends, some revolutionary crew members even went ashore to pull the ropes, ensuring transportation efficiency.

    把农用物资及时送到春耕第一线
    小清河航运局革命派破冰开航，二月份和三月上半月运送的农业生产急需物资，比去年同期增加一倍以上
    新华社济南二十三日电　山东小清河航运局今年二月和三月上半月运到春耕第一线的物资，比去年同期增加一倍以上。这是这个航运局的无产阶级革命派以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，破冰开航，大力支援农业所取得的成绩。
    小清河航运局过去在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，生产管理部门只强调完成吨公里的指标，结果各拖队为了多跑吨公里，都愿跑长途，不愿跑短途；愿拖运便于装卸的物资，不愿拖运零散和难装卸的物资。现在革命派编造计划，突出政治，打破了过去的老框框，把当前农业生产急需的物资，优先列入运输计划，并且规定随到随运，来多少，运多少，物资不择品种，运程不挑远近。他们还建立了托运代办业务，只要农村来信说明要从济南购买什么东西，就为代办，运送到家，负责到底。
    为了提前把各种支援农业的物资及早送到春耕第一线，刚一开河，革命的船员们就破冰开航，昼夜航行；船一到港，他们就帮助装卸工人装卸物资。冰冻初开，有的革命船员在航道弯多、水位枯浅的地方，还挺身而出上岸拉纤，保证了运输效率。
