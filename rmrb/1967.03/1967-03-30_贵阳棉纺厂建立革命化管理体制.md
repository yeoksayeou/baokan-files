	The Guiyang Cotton Mill's proletarian revolutionary faction, after taking power, with a spirit of "seizing the day," has broken down the old, unreasonable management structure and institutions. Under the factory revolutionary committee, three offices and one group have been established, reducing by 30 percent the number of personnel detached from production, and reinforcing the production front line. A new management system conducive to "grappling with the revolution and promoting production" has been initially set up.

	Before the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party of this factory implemented a set of capitalist and revisionist management systems. The structure was cumbersome and the hierarchy was complex. The factory had a total of 22 large and small departments and offices. Management cadres accounted for about 8 percent of the total number of employees, and non-production personnel once accounted for about 18 percent of the total number of employees. For a long time, this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were high above the masses, relying on bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities" and cumbersome regulations to implement bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing workers' production enthusiasm, and seriously shackling the development of productive forces. A large number of technical personnel were concentrated in the offices, detached from the masses, and detached from production reality.

	On March 6, after the establishment of the Guiyang Cotton Mill Revolutionary Committee and the unified revolutionary mass organization—the Mao Zedong Thought Guiyang Cotton Mill "March 1st" Combat Team—they immediately began to mobilize the masses to discuss streamlining the organization and reducing unnecessary non-production personnel to establish a new revolutionary production order, which is more conducive to grappling with the revolution and promoting production. During the discussion, the workers unanimously expressed: We will do what is beneficial to the revolution. Those old systems and frameworks that hinder the development of productive forces and serve the restoration of capitalism must be thoroughly smashed. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country," the workers studied it over and over again and were greatly inspired. The Party Central Committee's letter pointed out: "All workers in factories, mines, and enterprises must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study the experience of streamlining and efficiency. We must greatly reduce the number of personnel detached from production and greatly improve work efficiency. We must pay attention to frugality in revolution. Generally, workers in worker organizations should not be detached from production." The Party Central Committee's instructions gave the revolutionary faction workers a clear direction. They followed the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, with a spirit of "seizing the day," resolutely smashed the old, unreasonable structures, abolished the original 22 departments, and established a new management system based on the principles of facing production, facing the workshop, facing the masses, and being concise and efficient. Under the factory revolutionary committee, the Cultural Revolution Office, Administrative Production Office, Living Welfare Office, and Armed Protection Group were established to lead the entire factory's revolution and production. Now, 30 percent of the personnel detached from production in this factory have gone to the production workshops to work shifts, greatly reinforcing the production front line. The members of the factory revolutionary committee and all the staff of the "March 1st" Combat Team generally do not detach from production. Most of the technical cadres will, according to the principle of concentration, take root in the production workshops, live with the workers, study with them, and fight with them.

	The new management system initially established by the Guiyang Cotton Mill, with the goal of being highly revolutionary, is a good start to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the capitalist and revisionist enterprise management practices promoted by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. "Any new thing in its growth is bound to go through twists and turns." The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guiyang Cotton Mill deeply understands that breaking down the old, unreasonable structures and institutions and creating new proletarian revolutionary structures and institutions is a very complex and sharp struggle between two lines and two ideologies. On the road ahead, they are bound to encounter many difficulties. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome all difficulties, learn to swim while swimming, and blaze a trail of revolution in the management system.

    贵阳棉纺厂建立革命化管理体制
    无产阶级革命派本着面向生产，面向车间，面向群众和少而精的原则，撤除了原有的二十二个部门，在厂革命委员会下面设立三室一组，减少了百分之三十的脱离生产人员，充实生产第一线
    新华社贵阳二十九日电　贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派掌权后，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，破除了旧的不合理的管理机构和制度，在厂革命委员会下面设立三室一组，减少了百分之三十的脱离生产人员，充实生产第一线，初步建立起有利于“抓革命，促生产”的新的管理体制。
    文化大革命以前，这个厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行一套资本主义、修正主义的管理体制，机构庞大，层次重迭。全厂大大小小的科室部门有二十二个，管理干部占职工总数的百分之八左右，非生产人员一度占职工总数的百分之十八左右。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来高高在上，依靠资产阶级反动技术“权威”和烦琐的规章制度，实行资产阶级专政，压制工人的生产积极性，严重地束缚了生产力的发展。大量技术人员集中于科室，脱离群众，脱离生产实际。
    三月六日，贵阳棉纺厂革命委员会和统一的革命群众组织——毛泽东思想贵阳棉纺厂“三·一”战斗团建立以后，就着手发动群众讨论精简机构，减少不必要的非生产人员，以建立革命生产新秩序，更有利于抓革命，促生产。讨论中，职工们一致表示：有利于革命的事情，我们就干。那种阻碍生产力发展的、为复辟资本主义服务的旧制度、旧框框，再也不能存在下去了，必须彻底打碎。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发表后，职工们认真地学了一遍又一遍，受到极大的鼓舞。党中央的信指出：“一切厂矿职工，都必须在无产阶级文化大革命中，研究精兵简政的经验。既要大大减少脱离生产的人员，又要大大提高工作的效率。要注意节约闹革命。工人组织中的工作人员，一般都不要脱离生产。”党中央的指示，使革命派职工有了明确的方向。他们遵照毛主席、党中央的教导，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，坚决打碎了旧的不合理的机构，撤除了原有的二十二个部门，本着面向生产，面向车间，面向群众和少而精的原则，建立新的管理体制。在厂革命委员会下，设立了文化革命办公室、行政生产办公室、生活福利办公室和武装保卫组，领导全厂的革命和生产。现在，这个厂已有占脱离生产人员的百分之三十的干部，到生产车间顶班劳动，大大充实了生产第一线。厂革命委员会的委员和“三·一”战斗团的所有工作人员，一般都没有脱离生产。大部分技术干部，将根据归口的原则，扎根在生产车间，与工人生活在一起，学习在一起，战斗在一起。
    贵阳棉纺厂初步建立起来的以非常革命化为目标的新的管理体制，是彻底清除党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行资本主义、修正主义企业经营管理的流毒的一个良好开端。“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”贵阳棉纺厂的无产阶级革命派深深懂得，破除旧的不合理的机构和制度，创建新的无产阶级革命化的机构和制度，是一场十分复杂、十分尖锐的两条道路、两种思想的斗争，在前进的道路上，必然会碰到许多困难。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，排除一切困难，在游泳中学会游泳，在管理体制上闯出一条革命化的道路来。
