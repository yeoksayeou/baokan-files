A red light illuminates the sky, and joyous news spreads far and wide,
Chairman Mao points the way, and the poor and lower-middle peasants eagerly follow.
The "Three Articles" are always at hand, learning and applying them while spring plowing,
Every red heart shines brightly, achieving new victories on the production front.
The revolutionary army is full of spirit, marching forward in vast numbers,
Closely following Chairman Mao, winning victories in both revolution and production.
Carefully selecting and diligently choosing, with red hearts, skilled hands, and great aspirations,
Seeds of plenty are sown in spring, awaiting the joyous harvest report in autumn.
Songs of joy fill the air, and every member is full of enthusiasm,
Dredging rivers and canals, and accumulating fertilizer, the first shot of spring plowing is fired.

    抓革命　促春耕
    ——上海嘉定县娄塘公社（组画）
    上海同济大学东方红兵团红画笔
    一道红光照满天，一封喜信四处传，
    毛主席呀指方向，贫下中农齐争先。
    “老三篇”呀不离身，边学边用闹春耕，
    颗颗红心亮堂堂，生产战线立新功。
    革命大军斗志昂，浩浩荡荡上战场，
    紧紧跟着毛主席，革命生产打胜仗。
    仔细选呀用心挑，心红手巧志气豪，
    春天播下丰收种，喜待秋收传捷报。
    一片欢腾歌声飘，社员个个干劲高，
    又开河渠又积肥，打响春耕第一炮。
