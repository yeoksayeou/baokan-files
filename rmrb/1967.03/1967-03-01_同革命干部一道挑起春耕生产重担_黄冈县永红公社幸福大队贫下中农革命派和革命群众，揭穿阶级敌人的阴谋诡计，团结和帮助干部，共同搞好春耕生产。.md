The poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses of Happiness Production Brigade in Yonghong People's Commune, Huanggang County, have exposed the plots and tricks of the class enemy, united with and assisted the cadres, and jointly promoted spring production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 28th: “Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. We will do as he says. We resolutely stand with the revolutionary cadres to thoroughly overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and make production even better.” This is the oath of the poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary faction in Happiness Production Brigade, Yonghong People's Commune, Huanggang County, to “grasp revolution and promote production.”

Following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary faction of this brigade, with great revolutionary spirit, led the broad revolutionary masses to unite with revolutionary cadres, grasp revolution, and promote production, thus launching a spring production campaign. Since late January, various production teams have organized more than 150 laborers to collect and transport over a million pounds of manure and manure residue from nearby towns, most of which have already been delivered to the fields. The red clover for early rice, after universal fertilization, is growing well. Recently, they also raised the height of a four-mile-long low canal, ensuring that most of the cotton fields in the brigade can be irrigated smoothly, eliminating the threat of drought.

After the Cultural Revolution in rural areas, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses of this brigade were elated and full of spirit, enthusiastically shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!” However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road hate the Cultural Revolution to the core. They colluded with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to launch a frenzied counterattack. After the revolutionary masses extinguished the counter-revolutionary economic wind, they secretly instigated and incited production team cadres to lie down and do nothing.

The revolutionary faction of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary masses saw through the class enemy's tricks and launched a head-on struggle against them. They said, “To fire the first shot of spring production, we must first expose the class enemy's plots.” On one hand, they launched a resolute struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; on the other hand, they widely propagated Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. Through discussions and decisions by the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, they firmly believed in, supported, and assisted the revolutionary cadres to stand with the revolutionary masses and shoulder the burden of production. For cadres who made mistakes, they resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of “punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient,” adopting the principle of “unity-criticism-unity,” helping them recognize and correct their mistakes, and make amends. The brigade leader of this brigade was originally full of worries and dared not work boldly. After being helped by the revolutionary faction of the poor and lower-middle peasants, he accepted the entrustment of the poor and lower-middle peasants, went deep into a production team that had once fallen behind to assist in work. In his work, he humbly listened to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, consulted with the masses on every matter, actively promoted production, and proactively helped production team cadres remove their mental burdens and put down their packages.

Now, the Cultural Revolution in this brigade is burning more fiercely, and spring production is being promoted more vigorously. The growth of winter wheat, rapeseed, and other summer crops in the entire brigade is better than last year. The revolutionary faction of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary cadres all unanimously declared: We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of “grasp revolution and promote production,” vigorously carry out the Cultural Revolution, vigorously promote spring production, and are determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    同革命干部一道挑起春耕生产重担
    黄冈县永红公社幸福大队贫下中农革命派和革命群众，揭穿阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，团结和帮助干部，共同搞好春耕生产。
    据新华社武汉二十八日电　“毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，他老人家怎么说，我们就怎么干。我们坚决同革命的干部一道，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底斗倒斗臭，把生产搞得好上加好。”这是湖北黄冈县永红公社幸福大队贫下中农革命派发出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的誓言。
    这个大队的贫下中农革命派，按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以大无畏的革命气概，带领广大革命群众团结革命干部，抓革命，促生产，掀起了春耕生产高潮。一月下旬以来，各生产队组织了一百五十多个劳动力，到附近城镇捡粪、挑粪渣一百多万斤，现在大部分已经送到田间。作早稻底肥的红花草，经过普遍追肥，长势很好。最近，他们还把长达四华里的低渠道普遍加高，使全大队的大部分棉田都能顺利灌溉，消除了干旱的威胁。
    农村无产阶级文化大革命开展后，这个大队的广大贫下中农和革命群众，扬眉吐气，意气风发，热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却对文化大革命恨之入骨，他们与地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结在一起进行疯狂反扑。当反革命经济主义妖风刚被革命群众扑灭之后，他们又在暗中挑拨离间，唆使生产队干部躺倒不干。
    贫下中农革命派和革命群众一眼看穿了阶级敌人的诡计，向敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争。他们说：“要想打响春耕生产第一炮，先要揭穿阶级敌人的阴谋。”他们一方面向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了坚决的斗争；一方面广泛向群众宣传毛主席的干部政策。通过贫下中农和革命群众讨论决定，对于革命的干部，要坚定不移地相信他们，拥护他们，支持他们，动员他们和革命群众站在一起，把生产的重担挑起来。对犯错误的干部坚决执行毛主席制定的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的政策，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方针，帮助他们认识错误，改正错误，将功补过。这个大队的大队长原来是顾虑重重，不敢大胆工作。经过贫下中农革命派帮助后，他接受了贫下中农的委托，深入到一个生产一度落后的生产队帮助工作。他在工作中，虚心听取贫下中农的意见，遇事同群众商量，积极搞好生产，还主动帮助生产队干部解除思想顾虑，放下包袱。
    现在，这个大队文化大革命的烈火越烧越旺，春耕生产也越抓越好。全大队麦苗、油菜等夏熟作物生长情况胜过去年。贫下中农革命派和革命干部都一致表示：坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大搞文化革命，大闹春耕生产，决心夺取革命、生产双胜利。
