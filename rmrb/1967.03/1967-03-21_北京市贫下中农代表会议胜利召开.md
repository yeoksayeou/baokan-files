Xinhua News Agency, March 20th - In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the moment when Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" has achieved one victory after another, the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference was successfully convened on March 19th! More than 2,500 poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives from the 13 counties (districts) of the suburbs of Beijing gathered triumphantly in the magnificent Great Hall of the People, discussing the great cause of cultural revolution and agricultural production. This is a grand meeting of unity and solidarity among the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire city, a rally to mobilize all forces to achieve a great victory in the spring plowing production of the suburbs of Beijing. The convening of the conference is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a new victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

CPC Central Political Bureau Standing Committee member and Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, attended the meeting to congratulate and gave important instructions.

CPC Central Political Bureau Standing Committee member and Director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Chen Boda, CPC Central Political Bureau Standing Committee member and Advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group Kang Sheng, CPC Central Political Bureau Alternate Member and Vice Premier of the State Council Xie Fuzhi, Deputy Director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Jiang Qing, and members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Wang Li, Guan Feng, and Chen Boda also attended to congratulate. Comrade Chen Boda also spoke at the meeting.

Premier Zhou pointed out in his speech: Today, the poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives and community members from various counties in the suburbs of Beijing are holding a meeting here, and we congratulate you. You have successfully elected representatives to participate in the power organs of Beijing Municipality. You have responded to Chairman Mao's call and the call of the Party Central Committee, mobilizing all forces to do a good job in spring plowing. We believe that this conference will become the largest mobilization conference. We believe that agricultural production this year will be even better, and we believe that you will not only have a good spring plowing production but also a good summer harvest and a good autumn harvest. Premier Zhou went on to point out: Politics commands everything. First, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants' activists to truly seize the revolution and promote production. During the busy spring plowing season, production teams and brigades should not seize power, and even if power needs to be seized, it should not be seized. The spring plowing work should be done well. Those who were removed from their posts during the "Four Cleans" movement are not allowed to return to power and counterattack. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists should be controlled by you and not allowed to cause trouble, sow discord among the revolutionary masses, and create factional disputes. The Beijing Garrison has sent many personnel to support your spring plowing. They are not only the sons and daughters of the people but also the great army led by Vice Chairman Lin, who are holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. They are the best at studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. With their help, we believe that you will study Chairman Mao's works and quotations even better. With Mao Zedong Thought arming you, your strength is boundless.

Comrade Chen Boda said: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the convening of the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference is a major event. It is a major event for the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire country to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call, achieve great unity, seize the revolution, and promote production. He said: Chairman Mao has always told us that agriculture is the foundation of our socialist national economy. Chairman Mao has always fully and completely estimated the great role of the peasants in various revolutionary stages. Chairman Mao has always fully and completely estimated the great role of the peasants in the construction of revolutionary base areas and socialist construction. The fact is like this. It is particularly important to point out: The poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire country, together with the middle peasants and other laboring masses in the countryside, have made great contributions to our socialist revolution and socialist construction. We hope that after Chairman Mao's call for everyone to carry out the socialist education movement, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you will make even greater contributions. Your contributions will greatly help your laboring brothers, the working class. Your contributions are necessary for the vigorous development of the socialist industrial front. At the same time, this also means that your contributions will create better conditions for the working class to provide you with more agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and various industrial necessities for the countryside.

He hoped that the poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives present would resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," smash the plots of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to attempt a capitalist restoration, and defend the great achievements of the "Four Cleans" movement. The poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives should respond to Chairman Mao's great call, discuss and plan concretely, and launch a new high tide of spring plowing production in the suburbs of Beijing, where our great leader Chairman Mao is located. He also said that the revolutionary cadres at all levels of the rural people's communes should respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, work hard, be good children of the people, and help the poor and lower-middle peasants well, unite the middle peasants, and realize the socialist collective production plan. He said that cadres at all levels should cooperate well with the People's Liberation Army to strive for double victories in the Cultural Revolution and spring plowing production.

On the 19th, the Great Hall of the People was filled with revolutionary vigor and a fighting atmosphere. In the center of the stage, a giant color portrait of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, was hanging high. The red banner with the words "The revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is victorious for ten thousand years!" and "Hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" was hanging in the middle of the venue. The songs of Chairman Mao's quotations echoed throughout the venue.

The conference began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." Following that, more than 2,500 poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives read aloud "Chairman Mao's Quotations": "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." "You should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all comrades, cadres, and the masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year."

Since the issuance of the "Draft Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Countryside," the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing have held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and launched a great struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insist on their reactionary positions; thoroughly criticized the capitalist reactionary line, suppressed the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism; thoroughly smashed the "four olds" of the exploiting classes and established the "four news" of the proletariat; used the surging momentum of the Cultural Revolution to promote production, making the spring plowing production hot and lively. Especially after the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Countryside Across the Country," it further pointed out the direction of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" for the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in the suburbs of Beijing. They are clear-headed and bright-eyed, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, they quickly established command organs for seizing the revolution and promoting production on the front line in various counties (districts), communes, and production teams. The command organs at all levels used the authority of the proletariat to mobilize all positive factors and launched a high tide of spring plowing production. Now, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, they are holding a grand meeting with fighting joy, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the suburbs of Beijing.

The conference passed the "Resolution of the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference." The resolution pointed out: We will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply understand: The socialist road is our only bright path. We have only one mind, which is to follow this bright path to the end, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, block the road to capitalist restoration, and make our socialist state last for thousands of generations without change.

The resolution said: Doing a good job in spring plowing production is an important link in implementing the line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." We must fully value this battle of spring plowing production.

The resolution expressed that we should learn from the people of Dazhai, walk the path of Dazhai, and build a new socialist countryside in the style of Dazhai.

The resolution finally expressed that the poor and lower-middle peasants must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels must take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, thoroughly smash the "self" and establish the "public," and do a good job in ideological revolutionization. Through the Cultural Revolution, we will turn the countryside into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives from Pinggu, Huairou, Shunyi, Changping, Haidian, and Yanqing counties (districts) in the suburbs of Beijing spoke one after another at the meeting. They shouted with immense excitement: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long life! Ten thousand times a long life!" They pointed out that we poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In this Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, direct our spears at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insist on their reactionary positions, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. While seizing the revolution, we will vigorously promote production and fire the first shot of spring plowing production. The poor and lower-middle peasants must be the main force in seizing the revolution and promoting production. We must diligently read Chairman Mao's books, fight against the "self" in the depths of our souls, drive the "self" out of the door, establish the "public," and let the "public" settle down, doing a good job in ideological revolutionization.

Representatives of workers in Beijing, representatives of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, representatives of the conference of representatives of Red Guards from universities and colleges in the capital, and representatives from middle schools also spoke at the meeting. They expressed their determination to fight side by side with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and achieve victory together. Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The third political commissar of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, Liu Shaowen, spoke on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison. He emphasized that the People's Liberation Army is a people's army created by the great leader Chairman Mao, a armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks, a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whoever opposes the poor and lower-middle peasants is a counter-revolutionary, and we will never allow it. We will always stand with the poor and lower-middle peasants and be your strong backbone.

In the midst of thunderous applause, the "Letter of Respect to Chairman Mao" was passed. The letter said: Dearest Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants are unbreakable and indestructible tough guys. We have only one mind, which is to be forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever follow you forward in great waves! Sugar-coated bullets cannot knock us down, sweet words cannot deceive us, and plots cannot topple us. Please rest assured, we will definitely plant the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts all over every inch of land in the rural people's communes of Beijing, and definitely build the rural people's communes of Beijing into a new countryside that forever shines with your thoughts.

The conference unanimously passed the list of members of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference, the members of the Executive Committee, and the representatives to participate in the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

Those who attended the conference also included leaders from various relevant departments in Beijing Municipality: Wu De, Liu Jianxun, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Zhou Jingfang, Gao Yangwen, Ding Guanyi, Li Qingquan, and others.

The conference ended triumphantly with the majestic song "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman." (With pictures)

    陈伯达同志说：在无产阶级文化大革命中，北京市贫下中农代表会议的召开是一件大事，是全国贫下中农响应毛主席、党中央号召，实行大联合，抓革命、促生产的一件大事。他说：毛主席历来告诉我们，农业是我国社会主义国民经济的基础。毛主席一直是最充分地、最完全地估计农民在各个革命阶段中的伟大作用，毛主席一直是最充分地、最完全地估计农民在革命根据地建设中和社会主义建设中的伟大作用。事实就是这样。特别要指出：全国贫下中农，联合中农，联合农村中其他劳动群众，对我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设，已经作出了伟大的贡献。希望你们在毛主席号召大家进行社会主义教育运动之后，在无产阶级文化大革命中，做出更伟大的贡献。你们的这种贡献，将大大地援助自己劳动兄弟工人阶级。你们的这种贡献，是我国社会主义工业战线上的蓬勃发展所必需的。同时，这也是说，你们的这种贡献，是为工人阶级能够给你们提供更多的农业机械、化学肥料、农药和农村中各种工业必需品，创造更好的条件。
    他希望到会的贫下中农代表坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，打破地、富、反、坏、右分子妄图资本主义复辟的阴谋诡计，保卫“四清”运动的伟大成果。贫下中农代表应该响应毛主席的伟大号召，大家商量，脚踏实地地订出计划，在我们伟大领袖毛主席所在地首都郊区，掀起一个春耕生产新高潮。他还说，农村人民公社的各级革命干部，应该响应毛主席、党中央的号召，不辞辛苦，做人民的好儿女，好好地帮助贫下中农，团结中农，实现社会主义集体的生产计划。他说，各级干部要好好地同人民解放军合作，为夺取文化大革命和春耕生产的双胜利而奋斗。
    十九日，人民大会堂洋溢着革命的朝气和昂扬的战斗气氛。主席台的中央，高悬着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅彩色画像。“以毛主席为代表的革命路线胜利万岁！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的红色巨幅标语挂在会场正中，毛主席语录歌声响彻全场。
    大会在《东方红》的雄壮乐曲声中开始。接着两千五百多名贫下中农代表齐声朗读《毛主席语录》：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”
    《中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）》发布以来，北京郊区农村广大贫下中农和革命干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子的反；彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，煞住反革命经济主义黑风；大破剥削阶级的“四旧”，大立无产阶级的“四新”；把文化大革命中激发起来的冲天干劲用到生产上，把春耕生产闹得热气腾腾。特别是《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》公布以后，进一步给京郊广大贫下中农和各级干部指出了“抓革命，促生产”的方向，他们心明眼睛亮，在人民解放军大力支持下，迅速在各县（区）、社、队建立起抓革命促生产第一线指挥机构，各级指挥机构运用无产阶级的权威，调动了各方面的积极因素，掀起春耕生产高潮。现在，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，带着战斗的喜悦隆重集会，热烈欢呼京郊无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。

    决议说，搞好春耕生产，是执行“抓革命，促生产”方针的重要环节。我们要充分重视打好春耕生产这一仗。
    决议表示，要学大寨人，走大寨路，建设大寨式的新农村。
    决议最后表示，贫下中农一定要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。贫下中农和各级干部要把“老三篇”当作座右铭，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞好思想革命化。经过文化大革命，我们要把农村变成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    来自京郊平谷、怀柔、顺义、昌平、海淀、延庆等县（区）的贫下中农代表先后在会上发言，他们怀着万分激动的心情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝我们的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们指出，我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，在这次文化大革命中，我们一定要坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。在抓好革命的同时，猛促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮。贫下中农一定要当好抓革命、促生产的主力军。一定要苦读毛主席的书，在灵魂深处狠斗“私”字，把“私”字扫地出门，大立“公”字，让“公”字安家落户，搞好思想革命化。
    北京市工人代表、人民解放军北京卫戍区的代表以及首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会的代表和中学的代表也分别在会上发言。他们表示，坚决和广大贫下中农战斗在一起，胜利在一起。把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。人民解放军北京卫戍区第三政委刘绍文代表北京卫戍区全体指战员在会上发言。他强调说，人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，谁反对贫下中农，谁就是反革命，我们坚决不答应，我们永远和贫下中农站在一起，誓作你们的坚强后盾。
    在暴风雨般的掌声中通过了《给毛主席的致敬信》。信中说：最最敬爱的毛主席，我们贫下中农是压不倒，打不烂的硬汉子。我们只有一个心眼，就是永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远跟着您在大风浪里奋勇前进！糖衣炮弹打不倒，甜言蜜语骗不了，阴谋诡计搞不垮，请您老人家放心，我们一定要把您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，插遍北京农村人民公社的每寸土地，一定要把北京农村人民公社建设成为永远闪耀着您的思想光辉的新农村。
