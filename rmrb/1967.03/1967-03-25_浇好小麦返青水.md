Currently, it is the time for winter wheat to re-green. All wheat-producing areas should timely irrigate once for re-greening. To achieve water conservation and improve irrigation quality, each production brigade and team must pay attention to the arrangement of irrigation personnel. Some production teams arrange different numbers of people based on the flow rate of the main canals, while others do so based on the number of acres to be irrigated. However, the number of people must be appropriate, and the division of labor must be clear. During the irrigation for re-greening in the second production team of Sunshidam Village, Miaocheng Commune, Huairou County, six people were arranged during the day, and the effect was good. However, at night, only two people were arranged, resulting in too few people and too much water, making it difficult to manage. Many main canal outlets were flooded, and the fields were not properly irrigated. It is hoped that all communes and production brigades will not overlook the importance of properly arranging irrigation personnel.

    浇好小麦返青水
    目前正是冬小麦返青时节，各产麦区应及时浇一次返青水。为了做到节约用水和提高浇地质量，各社队要注意浇地人员的安排。有的生产队是根据毛渠的流量，有的是看浇地的亩数，安排不同人数。但是，人数一定要适当，分工一定要明确。怀柔县庙城公社孙史山大队第二生产队浇返青水的时候，白天安排六个人，效果很好；可是晚上最多安排两个人，结果人少水多，管不过来，很多毛渠口跑水，地没浇好。希望各地社队万万不要轻视妥善安排浇地人员这项工作。
