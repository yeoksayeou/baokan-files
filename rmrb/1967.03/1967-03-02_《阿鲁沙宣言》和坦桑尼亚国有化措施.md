Tanzania has recently implemented a series of measures to nationalize foreign banks, import-export companies, and several key factories.

Tanzania's significant steps are based on the resolutions of the national executive committee meeting of the Tanganyika African National Union held from January 26 to 29. In early February, the declaration passed at this meeting, known as the Arusha Declaration, was published. The declaration states: land, forests, mineral resources, banks, import-export, large-scale industries, and large-scale farms must all be controlled by the government. The declaration also points out, "Complete reliance on foreign aid will threaten our independence and other policies." "The development of a country depends on its people, not on money. Money is the result of development, not the basis for development."

On the day the Arusha Declaration was published, President Nyerere announced that all banks would be nationalized. On February 7, the Tanzanian government issued a statement implementing foreign exchange controls to prevent the outflow of currency. On February 10, the Tanzanian government issued a statement nationalizing eight flour mills. Additionally, the National Insurance Company and import-export companies were also nationalized. On February 12, President Nyerere announced that the government would hold a controlling stake in companies such as British American Tobacco, Bata Shoe Company, and the Shiraly Cotton Producers Association. Furthermore, currently, 21 companies are completely controlled by the government or supervised by the National Development Corporation.

The Tanzanian government's significant measures have received strong support from the broad masses. On February 5, a rally of 100,000 people was held in Dar es Salaam to support the Arusha Declaration. President Nyerere stated at the rally: "Only through self-reliance can we gain respect." "We have vast lands and more than ten million people;" "The development of our country depends on our own efforts and the will to complete the task."

On February 6, the Tanzanian armed forces held a demonstration march in the capital to support the Arusha Declaration and the government's corresponding measures. On February 7, a grand youth parade and rally were held in the capital. Workers, students, and women also held grand rallies and demonstration marches. The marchers held signs with slogans such as: "The action to eliminate foreign exploiters is very good!" "Build Tanzania with the sweat of the people!"

    《阿鲁沙宣言》和坦桑尼亚国有化措施
    坦桑尼亚最近采取了一系列措施，将外国银行、进出口公司和若干重要工厂收归国有。
    坦桑尼亚的这些重大措施，是根据一月二十六日到二十九日举行的坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟全国执行委员会会议的决议制定的。二月初发表了这个会议通过的《阿鲁沙宣言》。宣言指出：土地、森林、矿产资源、银行、进出口、大型工业和大型农场等，都必须由政府控制。这个宣言还指出，“完全依赖外援的作法，必将使我们的独立和其他政策遭到威胁”。“一个国家的发展取决于该国人民而不是取决于金钱。金钱是发展的结果而不是发展的基础”。
    尼雷尔总统在《阿鲁沙宣言》发表的当天宣布，将一切银行收归国有。二月七日，坦桑尼亚政府发表声明，宣布实行外汇管制，以防止货币外流。二月十日，坦桑尼亚政府发表声明，将八家面粉厂收归国有。另外，全国保险公司、进出口公司等也收归国有。二月十二日，尼雷尔总统宣布，对英美烟草公司、拔佳制鞋公司、西沙尔麻生产者协会等企业，政府将拥有起支配作用的股份。此外，目前已有二十一家公司完全由政府控制或由国家发展公司进行监督。
    坦桑尼亚政府的这些重大措施得到了广大人民的热烈支持。二月五日，达累斯萨拉姆举行了十万人的集会，支持《阿鲁沙宣言》。尼雷尔总统在会上指出：“只有通过自力更生的精神才能取得人们的尊敬”。“我们有着辽阔的土地和一千多万人口”；“我国的发展，依靠我们自己的努力工作和完成任务的意愿”。
    六日，坦桑尼亚武装部队在首都大街上举行示威游行，支持《阿鲁沙宣言》和政府采取的相应措施。七日首都举行了青年盛大游行和集会。工人、学生、妇女也先后分别举行了盛大集会和示威游行。游行者手中举着标语牌，上面写着：“铲除外国剥削者的行动好得很！”“用人民的汗水建设坦桑尼亚！”等口号。
