The Somali Writers' Union on March 25 issued a statement here strongly condemning the illegal so-called "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" to be held in Beirut, which was plotted by the Soviet revisionists, and firmly supporting the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held this year in Beijing.

The statement said that the Standing Committee of the Somali Writers' Union resolutely opposes the revisionist, splittist, and capitulationist treacherous plan to convene the so-called "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference."

The statement said that the convening of this splittist conference by the Soviet revisionists "exposed their reactionary face to the Afro-Asian peoples and revealed their despicable role as allies of U.S. imperialism."

The statement pointed out that the Afro-Asian peoples clearly know that, according to the resolution of the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers held last year, the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference will be held this year in the People's Republic of China.

The statement said: "We adhere to and support the resolution of the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers. We have already expressed our support for this resolution in the joint communiqué issued during the visit of the delegation of the Standing Committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau to our country. We reiterate that the Somali people and the Afro-Asian peoples firmly support the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in the People's Republic of China and firmly support the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau headed by Secretary-General Senanayake with its headquarters in Colombo and the Executive Secretariat in Beijing."

The statement said: "The Standing Committee of the Somali Writers' Union is taking resolute and decisive action to ensure the success of the genuine Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing."

The statement expressed that the Somali writers will raise high the banner of unity of Afro-Asian revolutionary writers, oppose imperialism, colonialism, and modern revisionism and their running dogs, and advance the revolutionary cause of the people of the world to victory.

The Somali Writers' Union finally declared in the statement: "Down with the splittist and disruptive actions plotted by the Soviet revisionists!"
