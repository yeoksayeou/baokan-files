		All revolutionary masses across the country resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions
		Following the great leader's guidance to implement the "three-in-one combination"

		In the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power organs, the role of revolutionary mass organization leaders must be fully brought into play, the core and backbone role of revolutionary cadres must be fully recognized, and the participation of local military representatives must be warmly welcomed.

		Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine's editorial "On the Revolutionary 'Three-in-One Combination,'" which conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Revolutionary cadres in various places have expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and, in places and units where power needs to be seized, resolutely implement the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat, achieving a thorough victory in the proletarian revolutionary power seizure struggle!

		Since the publication of the editorial, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country have launched extensive, in-depth learning, discussion, and propaganda activities. People have shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" a thousand times, a million times, acclaiming Chairman Mao for timely pointing out the direction of victory for the proletarian revolutionary power seizure struggle. Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat say that the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" proposed by Chairman Mao is the political and organizational guarantee for the victory of the proletarian revolutionary power seizure struggle. They have expressed that they will definitely follow the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and will not stop halfway!

		Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Tibet have seriously studied the editorial of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine. They say that the editorial points out that in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, the role of revolutionary mass organization leaders must be fully brought into play, and the broad revolutionary masses are the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs. This is Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's greatest trust, greatest support, and greatest encouragement for us revolutionary masses! We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." They also point out that a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and class enemies are most afraid of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." They play tricks and set fires, attempting to incite revolutionary masses to exclude revolutionary leading cadres and to incite revolutionary masses to sever their blood ties with the People's Liberation Army. We revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must maintain a clear mind, recognize the direction, stand firm, smash all the enemy's tricks, and resolutely implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The former deputy director of the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory, Guan Jinquan, said, "In our factory, the proletarian revolutionary cadres have played a huge role and achieved great results in seizing the revolution and promoting production. In the 'three-in-one combination,' we must not treat the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations as decorations. We must fully bring into play the role of revolutionary mass organization leaders. If someone seizes on the shortcomings and mistakes of revolutionary mass organization leaders to exclude them, we firmly oppose it. We revolutionary cadres will definitely take practical actions to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.'"

		Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Jiangsu, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Guangxi have seriously studied the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine after emphasizing that the half-year-plus proletarian cultural revolution mass movement has proven that the majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. We will definitely implement Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" without any reduction or omission, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, oppose the erroneous view of generally excluding and overthrowing cadres, unite with revolutionary cadres, and fight shoulder to shoulder to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At the same time, we must be vigilant against those with ulterior motives who distort the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," use the "three-in-one combination" as an excuse to promote conciliationism, eclecticism, and the merging of two into one, and even use the "three-in-one combination" as an excuse to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. Many Red Guards in Tianjin pointed out that whether one can correctly treat revolutionary cadres is a question of whether a revolutionary mass organization is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and whether it is resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy. We warmly welcome revolutionary cadres to rebel against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. We will definitely unite with revolutionary cadres to make a revolution and warmly support revolutionary leading cadres to participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs. Many Red Guards in Changchun, in conjunction with local struggle practices, studied the editorial of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine. Everyone believes that revolutionary leading cadres must be firmly relied upon and actively supported; for cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they criticize and correct their mistakes, draw a clear line with a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line, and genuinely stand on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, they should be united with according to the principle that revolution does not distinguish between early and late comers. Within the proletarian revolutionary cadres, we must prevent the erroneous idea of doubting and overthrowing everything. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Beijing Postage Stamp Factory said: Revolutionary cadres have relatively rich experience in class struggle, have stronger organizational abilities, and have certain abilities in enterprise production management. If revolutionary cadres do not participate in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, power cannot be seized and used well. However, the "three-in-one combination" must be a revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Those who insist on their mistakes, do not draw a clear line with capitalist roaders, and do not draw a clear line with the reactionary bourgeois line cannot be imposed on the masses and forcibly pulled into the "three-in-one combination" power organs. They expressed their determination to implement and defend Chairman Mao's great policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

		Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country most resolutely support and most enthusiastically welcome the participation of representatives of the People's Liberation Army in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs. Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Fujian, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Yunnan pointed out that the great People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Only with the participation of the People's Liberation Army representatives in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs can it have the greatest proletarian authority; with the support of the People's Liberation Army, the power of revolutionary masses will be even greater. They said that the People's Liberation Army has made important contributions in supporting the proletarian revolutionary power seizure struggle. The attitude towards the People's Liberation Army is the attitude towards the proletarian dictatorship and is also an important sign to distinguish whether one is a genuine revolutionary leftist. Revolutionary masses in the coastal city of Fuzhou, on the front line of national defense, have a particularly deep understanding of this. On the evening of the ninth, when the revolutionary young fighters of the Fujian Province "August 29th" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters were holding a debate, upon hearing the broadcast of the editorial of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine, they excitedly suspended the debate and sat in front of the radio, listening and taking notes. After listening to the broadcast, in conjunction with their personal experiences of quickly smashing the latest counterattack of the reactionary bourgeois line in the recent sharp and complex struggle with the firm support of the People's Liberation Army, the young fighters said with deep feelings: In the previous struggle, we closely relied on the People's Liberation Army and fought and won together with the People's Liberation Army. Now, the publication of the editorial of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine has further enabled us to understand that the People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao, is not only the most reliable pillar for defending the national defense and the proletarian dictatorship but also the most reliable pillar for defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The young fighters repeatedly shouted: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army of China, salute the People's Liberation Army of China! Long live the great People's Liberation Army of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" (with a picture)

		After the publication of the editorial of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine, the People's Liberation Army unit stationed in Beijing immediately enthusiastically propagandized to the local production team members, quickly conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses.

    全国广大革命群众表示坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示
    沿着伟大领袖指引的方向搞好“三结合”
    在革命的“三结合”权力机构中，必须充分发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用，充分估计革命干部的核心作用和骨干作用，热烈拥护当地驻军代表参加。
    新华社十一日讯　全国各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志第五期社论《论革命的“三结合”》传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。各地无产阶级革命派表示，一定遵照毛主席的教导，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，坚决实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构，取得无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的彻底胜利！
    自从社论发表以来，各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，展开了广泛深入的学习、讨论和宣传活动。人们千遍万遍地欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”欢呼毛主席为无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争及时指出了胜利的航向。广大无产阶级革命派说，毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争取得胜利的政治保证和组织保证。他们表示，一定要沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，决不半途而废！
    北京、天津、江西、安徽、浙江、河南、宁夏、新疆、西藏等地的无产阶级革命派和革命群众认真学习了《红旗》杂志第五期社论。他们说，社论指出在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中，必须充分发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用，广大革命群众是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础，这是毛主席、党中央对我们革命群众的最大信任、最大支持、最大鼓舞！我们一定遵照毛主席的指示办事，搞好革命的“三结合”。他们还指出，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和阶级敌人最害怕革命的“三结合”，他们耍阴谋，点邪火，妄图挑拨革命群众排斥革命的领导干部，挑拨革命群众与人民解放军血肉相连的关系，我们无产阶级革命派战士一定要保持清醒的头脑，认清方向，站稳立场，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，坚决实现革命的“三结合”。原合肥矿山机器厂副厂长管锦泉说，我们厂里的无产阶级革命派，在抓革命，促生产当中，起了巨大作用，作出了巨大成绩。在“三结合”当中，我们绝不能把革命群众组织的负责人当作陪衬，一定要更大地发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用。如果有人抓住革命群众组织负责人的某些缺点和错误，排斥他们，我们坚决反对。我们革命干部一定要用实际行动坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针。各地正在进行整风的无产阶级革命派组织的战士们表示，《红旗》杂志第五期社论指出革命群众具有可贵的革命的自觉性和创造性，这充分说明我们的党，我们的伟大领袖毛主席是多么相信群众。我们决心把自己既当作革命的一份力量，也当作革命的对象，在整风中勇敢地夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，使自己在政治上更快、更好地成长起来。
    河北、辽宁、吉林、江苏、甘肃、陕西、广西等地的广大革命群众认真学习了《红旗》杂志社论以后，强调指出，经过半年多来无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的严峻考验，证明我们的大多数干部是好的和比较好的。我们一定不折不扣地、全面地贯彻执行毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，反对那种对干部一概排斥、一概打倒的错误观点，同革命干部团结起来，并肩战斗，胜利进行向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争。同时，必须警惕别有用心的人歪曲革命的“三结合”的方针，借口“三结合”，搞折中主义，调和主义，合二而一，甚至借口“三结合”搞反革命复辟。天津的许多红卫兵小将指出，能否正确对待革命干部，是衡量一个革命群众组织是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是不是坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的问题。我们热烈欢迎革命干部起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，我们一定团结革命干部一块儿闹革命，热烈拥护革命领导干部参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构。长春市许多红色造反者结合当地斗争实践，学习了《红旗》杂志第五期社论。大家认为，对革命的领导干部，一定要坚决依靠，积极支持；对犯有错误的干部，只要他们检讨错误，改正错误，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线划清界限，真正站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，就应该按照革命不分先后的原则，团结他们。在无产阶级革命派内部，要防止怀疑一切、打倒一切的错误思想。北京邮票厂的无产阶级革命派说：革命干部在阶级斗争中有比较丰富的斗争经验，组织能力比较强，在企业生产管理上具有一定的能力，如果没有革命干部参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，就不能掌好权，用好权。但是，“三结合”必须是革命的“三结合”，不能把坚持错误，不同走资本主义道路当权派划清界限、不同资产阶级反动路线划清界限的人，强加在群众头上，硬拉到“三结合”的权力机构中来。他们表示坚决贯彻执行和捍卫毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的伟大方针。
    各地的广大革命群众和革命干部最坚决地拥护、最热烈地欢迎人民解放军代表参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构。福建、青海、内蒙古、湖南、湖北、广东、四川、云南等地的无产阶级革命派指出，伟大的中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，有解放军代表参加“三结合”临时权力机构，才可能具有最大的无产阶级权威；有了人民解放军的支援，我们革命群众的力量就更大了。他们说，人民解放军在支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，已经做出了重要贡献。对于人民解放军的态度，就是对于无产阶级专政的态度，也是区别是不是真正的革命左派的一个重要标志。海防前线城市——福州市广大革命群众，对此感受特别深。九日晚上，正在举行辩论会的福建省“八·二九”革命造反总部的革命小将们，一听到广播《红旗》杂志第五期社论，兴奋地暂停辩论，坐在收音机前一边听，一边记。小将们听完广播，结合不久前在尖锐复杂的斗争中，在人民解放军的坚决支援下，迅速粉碎资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑的亲身经历，深有体会地说：在前段斗争中，我们紧紧依靠解放军，同解放军战斗在一起，胜利在一起。现在《红旗》杂志第五期社论的发表，使我们进一步认识到毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军，不但是保卫祖国国防、保卫无产阶级专政的最可靠的柱石，也是保卫无产阶级文化大革命，实行革命的“三结合”的最可靠的柱石。小将们不断地高呼：“向中国人民解放军学习，向中国人民解放军致敬！”“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”（附图片）
    《红旗》杂志第五期社论发表后，人民解放军驻京某部立即向当地生产队社员进行热情的宣传，把毛主席的最新指示迅速传给广大革命群众。
