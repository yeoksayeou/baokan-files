French Grape Farmers Stage Protests

Fifty-three thousand French grape farmers staged protests on March 16 in the prefectures of Montpellier (Hérault), Carcassonne (Aude), and Draguignan (Var) along the French Mediterranean coast, demanding that the government purchase their wine and stop importing foreign wine.

New Zealand Workers Protest Government's Economic Policies

Over 5,000 workers in Wellington, New Zealand's capital, stopped work and held a rally on March 17 to protest the New Zealand government's policy of shifting economic difficulties onto the working people.

Previously, workers in Auckland, Christchurch, and Dunedin had also held similar protest rallies. It is estimated that about 40,000 workers participated in these protests this week.

Recognizing that the government's support for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam is a major cause of the current economic difficulties, the protesting workers held up signs denouncing the government's spending on the Vietnam War as they marched to the rally site. They passed a resolution at the rally demanding "the immediate withdrawal of all New Zealand troops from Vietnam."
