According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in London on the 24th, according to reports from American and British newspapers, while accelerating the restoration of capitalism at home, the Soviet revisionist clique is adopting an "open door policy" to encourage the infiltration of American monopoly capital, subjecting the working people to exploitation by foreign capital.

The latest issue of the American weekly "The New Republic" reported that the Soviet Union recently placed an advertisement in the New York Times to attract American investment. The report revealed that under the slogans of "liberalization" and "economic reform," the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries are vigorously implementing economic measures to restore capitalism, making it convenient for them to form enterprise partnerships with Western companies. Both sides have greatly improved cooperation in industrial and technological fields and can use similar languages and concepts.

The report said that American enterprises are very interested in this "cooperation." An international investment group originally established by the Rockefeller family, "International Basic Economic Corporation," has obtained "a fifty-fifty partnership" in its "investments" in some Eastern European countries. The report pointed out that "cooperation" is usually carried out in the following way: the "Western partner" provides "machinery, technical assistance, and administrative management," while the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries provide "factories, workers, raw materials, and some components." The "Western partner" then reaps profits under the pretext of "rent" and "management fees."

The report pointed out that this "cooperation" is highly beneficial to the "Western partner." Now, they can exploit high profits by utilizing the "cheap technical labor" in these countries. Because they produce in these countries and then export to Western countries or other markets, they can obtain very high profits.

In an article titled "The Rockefeller Family Moves East," the British weekly "Forum" also pointed out that the collusion and dealings between American monopoly capital and the Soviet revisionist clique, especially the so-called "joint production," is "a partnership far beyond the usual trade relations." This magazine believes that it will not be long before several large American monopolies will one by one enter the Soviet economic sphere.

### 苏修集团开门揖盗  竭力鼓励美国垄断资本渗入苏联

    苏修集团开门揖盗
    竭力鼓励美国垄断资本渗入苏联
    据新华社伦敦二十四日电  据美英报刊报道，苏联修正主义集团在加速国内复辟资本主义的同时，正在采取“开门揖盗”的政策，鼓励美国垄断资本的渗入，使劳动人民遭到外国资本的剥削。
    美国《新共和》周刊最近的一篇报道，在谈到苏联不久前在美国的《纽约时报》上刊登广告招揽美国投资时透露，由于苏联和某些东欧国家在“自由化”和“经济改革”的口号下，大力推行使资本主义复辟的经济措施，它们“同西方公司结成企业合伙关系方便了”，“双方大大改善了工业、技术方面的合作”，而且“能够有类似的语言，使用类似的概念”。
    报道说，美国企业对于这种“合作”关系“很感兴趣”。一个原先由洛克菲勒家族建立的大国际投资集团“国际基本经济公司”就在对某些东欧国家的“投资”中，取得了“一半对一半的合伙权利”。这篇报道指出，“合作”通常是这样进行的：由“西方伙伴”供应“机器、技术援助、行政管理”，苏联及某些东欧国家则供应“工厂、工人、原料和某些部件”，而“西方伙伴”就在“租金”及“管理费用”的名目下捞取利润。
    报道指出，这种“合作”对“西方伙伴”有巨大的好处。现在，他们可以利用这些国家的“廉价的技术劳动力”榨取优厚利润，因为，他们在这些国家进行生产，然后再向西方国家或其它地方的市场输出，都可以获得很高的利润。
    英国《论坛》周刊在一篇题为《洛克菲勒家族朝东走》的文章中也指出，美国垄断资本和苏联修正主义集团在这方面的勾结和交易，特别是所谓“共同生产”，是“一种大大超出通常的贸易关系的伙伴关系。”这家周刊认为，不要很久，美国的几个大垄断财团就将一个接一个地打入苏联经济领域。
