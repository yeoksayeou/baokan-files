On the eve of U.S. imperialist head Johnson's personal trip to Guam to plot new war adventures in Vietnam, some prominent figures and bourgeois newspapers in the U.S. ruling clique have issued a chorus of frenzied war cries, preparing public opinion for further U.S. imperialist expansion of the war.

Johnson's speech on March 15 set the tone for Washington's war symphony. In that speech, he menacingly declared that the U.S. choice on the Vietnam issue is clear. "We are willing to stay the course. We are determined to stay the course." His subordinate in charge of the war machine, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, even more arrogantly stated that to maintain a foothold in South Vietnam, the U.S. is willing to risk a larger-scale war. They boasted that the U.S. now has the "capability" to deal with any "incidents" and "major emergencies" that might occur outside Vietnam.

The most common argument heard in this war drumbeat is the advocacy of expanding bombing of North Vietnam, in an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to kneel and seek "peace." The commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, while demanding more troops for South Vietnam, emphasized that expanding the bombing of North Vietnam is "indispensable and extremely important" to U.S. military strategy.

The U.S. imperialists' policy of indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam, having utterly failed to shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to fight to the end, has increasingly led Washington to issue calls to expand the ground war in Vietnam to the North. Former U.S. Strategic Air Command chief LeMay recently, while discussing the expansion of bombing, frenziedly shouted: "If this strategy fails, it may be necessary to invade by land." Former U.S. commander in Korea Clark also advocated giving U.S. military commanders in Vietnam the right to cross the border and strike every military target in the North worth striking, to force the Vietnamese people "to the negotiating table."

In fact, the U.S. official propaganda agency, the United States Information Agency, on the 17th, in commenting on the upcoming Guam conference, has already made it very clear that this conference will be an unadulterated war conference. On the same day, the Associated Press revealed that Johnson will issue orders at the Guam conference to tighten the screws on military pressure against North Vietnam.

These bloodthirsty war cries are completely a manifestation of U.S. imperialism's recent intensified "war and peace" two-pronged strategy failing and its desperate last-ditch struggle, completely failing to hide the weakness of the U.S. ruling clique and its inner fear. Some newspapers admit that the more the Johnson administration expands the war, the more disastrous the U.S. defeat will be. The New York Times editorial on the 19th, after lamenting the failure of the U.S. "war and peace" two-pronged strategy, gloomily said: "This week's Guam conference is more likely to deepen the dilemma (the U.S. currently faces in the Vietnam issue) than to get out of it." On the 17th, the Associated Press correspondent in Saigon, while looking ahead to the prospect of an expanded war, wrote in a depressed tone: "The Vietnam War will become increasingly large in scale... and as the number of U.S. troops increases, the number of casualties will also continue to rise," "No one in power thinks the end is in sight." Even Johnson himself, while inciting war, has repeatedly despondently admitted: "This war is long and difficult," the U.S. in Vietnam "is on a painful path."

### 为关岛会议策划扩大侵越战争制造舆论准备  美国军政头目发出疯狂战争叫嚣

    为关岛会议策划扩大侵越战争制造舆论准备
    美国军政头目发出疯狂战争叫嚣
    据新华社二十日讯  在美帝国主义头子约翰逊亲自去关岛策划侵略越南的新的战争冒险的前夕，美国统治集团中的一些头面人物和资产阶级报刊，发出了一片疯狂的战争叫嚣，为美帝国主义进一步扩大战争制造舆论准备。
    约翰逊三月十五日的一次讲话，为华盛顿的战争大合唱定下了基调。他在那次讲话中凶相毕露地扬言，美国在越南问题上的“抉择是清楚的。我们愿意坚持到底。我们决心坚持到底。”他手下掌管战争机器的国防部长麦克纳马拉、参谋长联席会议主席惠勒，更是嚣张地表示，为了坚持赖在南越，美国将不惜冒打一场更大规模战争的风险。他们扬言，美国现在“有能力”来对付在越南以外可能发生的“偶发事件”和“重大紧急事件”。
    在这片战争鼓噪声中最常听到的一种论调是，鼓吹扩大对越南北方的轰炸，妄图迫使越南人民屈膝求“和”。侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰在要求继续增兵南越的同时，强调扩大轰炸越南北方对美国的“军事战略是不可缺少和极其重要的”。
    美帝国主义对越南北方的狂轰滥炸政策，由于丝毫也没有动摇越南人民坚决抗战到底的决心，遭到了可耻的失败，华盛顿越来越多地发出了把侵越地面战争扩大到越南北方的叫嚣。前美国战略空军司令李梅最近在谈到扩大轰炸时，疯狂叫嚷：“如果这个战略失败，就可能必须从陆上入侵”。美国侵朝败将克拉克也鼓吹让美国的侵越“军事司令官有权越界并打击北方的每一个值得打击的军事目标”，以迫使越南人民“跑到会议桌边来”。
    事实上，美国官方宣传机构美新处十七日在评论即将举行的关岛会议时，已经很清楚地表明，这次会议将是一次不折不扣的战争会议。同一天，合众国际社透露，约翰逊在关岛会议上，将发出把对越南北方“施加军事压力的螺丝钉再拧紧一下的命令”。
    这些杀气腾腾的战争叫嚣，完全是美帝国主义最近加紧推行的战、“和”两手策略遭到失败后企图进行垂死挣扎的表现，丝毫掩饰不了美国统治集团的虚弱和它内心的恐惧。一些报刊承认，约翰逊政府越是扩大战争，美国的失败也就越惨。《纽约时报》十九日的社论在哀叹美国的战、“和”两手均告失灵之后，黯然地说：“本周的关岛会议与其说会摆脱（美国目前在越南问题上的）这种进退两难的困境，不如说会加深这种困境。”十七日，美联社驻西贡记者在展望扩大战争的前景时，语调低沉地写道：“越南战争将变得规模越来越大……而随着美军人数的增加，伤亡人数大约也将继续增加”，“掌权的人当中，没有人认为结局就在眼前”。甚至约翰逊自己在鼓噪战争的同时，也一再沮丧地承认：“这场战争是长期的和困难的”，美国在越南“走的道路是痛苦的”。
