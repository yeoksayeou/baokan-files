The meeting of foreign ministers of the American states held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from February 15 to 26, was a conference where U.S. imperialism further pushed its policy of economic aggression in Latin America. This meeting adopted a resolution to amend the charter of the Organization of American States, incorporating the principles of the U.S. neocolonialist program "Alliance for Progress" into the charter. The meeting also decided to convene a summit of American states in Uruguay from April 12 to 14 to promote the "economic integration" of Latin America, which the U.S. has been vigorously advocating.

Since 1961, U.S. imperialism has been pushing the so-called "Alliance for Progress" plan, annually proclaiming to "aid" Latin America in "economic development." In reality, it has been aggressively exporting commodities and capital, conducting political and economic infiltration, and promoting its neocolonialism. Since last year, U.S. officials have further proposed that the "new goals" of the "Alliance for Progress" should be to achieve "economic integration" in Latin America, claiming this will make economic activities in Latin America "more efficient" and "more economical," thereby "benefiting" the "economic development" of Latin America. At the recently concluded meeting of foreign ministers of the American states, the U.S. representative once again expressed "full support" for the "economic integration" of Latin America.

The so-called "economic integration" aims to establish a common market, a unified tariff system, and a unified industrial system. In this way, commodities, capital, and labor in the entire Latin America can flow freely without any restrictions. Given that the U.S. holds a unique controlling position over the economy of Latin America, once this plan is implemented, U.S. capital and commodities can more freely infiltrate the countries of Latin America, facilitating higher levels of exploitation and plunder by U.S. imperialism.

The exploitative nature of the U.S. economic policy towards Latin America is fully exposed in its investment, loans, and trade activities in the region. In recent years, under the guise of "aid for development," U.S. capital has aggressively entered Latin America, intensifying its blood-sucking activities. Currently, the total amount of U.S. private direct investment in Latin America has reached over $9 billion. Last year, new investments amounted to approximately $2 billion, and this year it is expected to increase to $3 billion. Statistics show that from 1961 to 1964, U.S. private investments annually yielded profits of over $1 billion. U.S. capitalists themselves have revealed that the rate of return on some U.S. investments in Latin America is as high as 40%.

U.S. loans to Latin American countries are a means of political control and economic aggression. The harsh conditions attached to these loans include coercing Latin American countries to devalue their currencies, "reform" their tax systems, and privatize nationalized enterprises, all of which are beneficial to the infiltration and plunder of U.S. monopoly capital.

The increasing external debt of Latin American countries, the dwindling foreign exchange reserves, the repeated devaluation of currencies, the stagnation and decline of economic growth rates, the continuous rise in living costs, and the worsening unemployment and poverty of the working people are all the evil results of U.S. economic plunder. During the five and a half years of the U.S. implementation of the "Alliance for Progress" plan, the economic situation in Latin America has further deteriorated.

The recent meeting in Buenos Aires once again proves that U.S. imperialism is always scheming to strengthen its plunder, which is the essence of imperialism. No matter what tricks U.S. imperialism plays in Latin America, its increasingly aggressive and plundering policies towards Latin America are becoming more and more exposed.

    美帝对拉丁美洲的侵略面目暴露无遗
    在泛美外长会议上鼓吹“经济一体化”，加紧推行“争取进步联盟”计划
    据新华社三日讯　从二月十五日到二十六日在阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯举行的泛美外长会议，是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲进一步推行经济侵略政策的会议。这次会议通过了修改美洲国家组织宪章的决议，把美国新殖民主义纲领“争取进步联盟”的原则列入宪章条款。会议还决定在四月十二日到十四日在乌拉圭召开美洲国家首脑会议，推行美国所竭力鼓吹的拉丁美洲“组织一体化”。
    美帝国主义从一九六一年以来就搞出一个所谓“争取进步联盟”计划，年年高唱要“援助”拉丁美洲“开发经济”，实际是大搞商品和资本输出，大搞政治和经济渗透，推行它的新殖民主义。从去年以来，美国官方进一步提出，“争取进步联盟”的“新目标”应该是实现拉丁美洲的“经济一体化”，宣传这将使拉丁美洲经济活动“更有效率”、“更经济”，从而“有利于”拉丁美洲的“经济发展”。在刚刚闭幕的泛美外长会议上，美国代表再次表示“全力支持”拉丁美洲的“经济一体化”。
    所谓“经济一体化”就是要建立一个共同市场、统一的关税制度，统一的工业系统。这样，在整个拉丁美洲，商品、资本和劳动力就可以自由流动，不受任何限制。由于美国对拉丁美洲经济处于独一无二的控制地位，这种计划一旦实现，美国的资本和商品就可以更加畅通无阻地侵入拉丁美洲各国，便于美帝国主义更高度的剥削和掠夺。
    美国对拉丁美洲经济政策的掠夺本质，充分暴露在它对拉丁美洲的投资、贷款、贸易的活动上。这些年来，在“援助开发”的外衣下，美国资本长驱直入拉丁美洲，加紧它的吸血的勾当。现在美国在拉丁美洲的私人直接投资总数已经达到九十多亿美元。去年一年中，美国新投资大约有两亿美元，今年可能要增加到三亿美元的数目。据统计，从一九六一年到一九六四年间，美国私人投资每年获利都在十亿美元上下。美国资本家自己透露，美国在拉丁美洲的某些投资榨取利润率高到百分之四十。
    美国对拉丁美洲国家的贷款是实行政治控制和经济侵略的开路机。贷款附加的苛刻条件，包括胁迫拉丁美洲国家实行货币贬值、“改革”税收制度、把国有化企业改为私营等措施，以有利于美国垄断资本的渗入与掠夺。
    拉丁美洲国家外债不断增加、外汇储备越来越少、货币一再贬值、经济增长率停滞和下降、生活费用不断上涨、劳动人民失业和贫穷加剧，这些就是美帝的经济掠夺造成的罪恶的结果。美国推行“争取进步联盟”计划的五年半期间，拉丁美洲的经济状况是更加恶化了。
    最近举行的布宜诺斯艾利斯会议又一次证明，美帝总是千方百计地要加强它的掠夺，这就是帝国主义的本质。不管美帝国主义在拉丁美洲玩弄什么样的花招，它日益加紧对拉丁美洲进行侵略和掠夺政策的狰狞嘴脸，却是越来越暴露得更加清楚了。
