	Fighting and Learning Simultaneously
	Revolutionizing the Soul
	Revolutionary Students of New Peking University Cheer for the Revolutionary Big-Character Poster of the Red East Squad

	The People's Daily reports: After the publication of the article “Where is the Lu Xun Brigade Going?” and related commentaries in this newspaper on February 26, revolutionary cadres of the proletariat unanimously praised it as an excellent article that actively applies Chairman Mao’s works, providing them with great inspiration and education.

	The following is a summary of the discussion by some revolutionary comrades of the “New Peking Commune.”

	Implementing Chairman Mao’s Instructions in Action

	Comrade Jiang Rong said: I read the excellent article “Where is the Lu Xun Brigade Going?” with great excitement. It is excellent because, like the heroes of the 32111 Well Drilling Team, the young fighters of the Red East have “imprinted Chairman Mao’s instructions in their minds, dissolved them in their blood, and implemented them in action.” Their revolutionary spirit in rectification is worth learning from by revolutionary young fighters nationwide.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “We must carry out rectification, and we will continue to do so in the future, to constantly eliminate the erroneous elements within us, so that we can better shoulder this responsibility and better work together with all patriotic intellectuals outside the Party.” Recently, the revolutionary young fighters of New Peking University conducted a rectification campaign and achieved certain successes. However, some comrades still treat rectification superficially, talking more than doing, with much thunder but little rain. For example, some use the excuse of being busy with work to avoid calmly studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and summarizing the experiences and lessons of the previous stage. Some, although knowing the significance of rectification, lack the courage to attack the “selfish” element, just as Chairman Mao said, merely holding the arrow and rubbing it, praising, “Good arrow! Good arrow!” without using these arrows to shoot at the target of their own thoughts. This attitude is completely wrong. We must constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our subjective world, carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, and build our organization into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready force, making the Cultural Revolution even better.

	Rectification of Thought is the Need of the Current Struggle

	Comrade Qiu Zhen Dong said: Over the past few months, we have united and fought fiercely against the authorities who take the capitalist road and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, achieving great successes. However, we have to some extent neglected self-transformation. Comrades rarely exchange thoughts, are reluctant to bring out problems, and lack active ideological struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm in our country will take a fairly long time to resolve… If one does not fully recognize this situation, or does not recognize it at all, one will commit a major error and neglect the necessary ideological struggle.” From our current rectification, we deeply feel that without rectifying our thoughts, we cannot carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, nor can we become steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Comrade Zhang Bing said: The big-character poster “Where is the Lu Xun Brigade Going?” raises a problem that is universally present and urgently needs to be solved. The single-minded military viewpoint, “materialism in command,” and sectarianism exist to varying degrees in our revolutionary organizations, and some are even quite serious. These non-proletarian thoughts, regardless of their manifestations, are essentially an “ego.” At this critical moment when the Cultural Revolution is developing towards the “three-in-one combination,” if we do not overthrow the “ego” in our minds, we cannot achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	Transforming the Worldview with Mao Zedong Thought

	Comrade Zhang Jia Qi said: The revolutionary comrades in Shanghai dare to open their doors wide, fighting and rectifying simultaneously, which is a manifestation of being bold. This spirit is excellent! All genuine proletarian revolutionaries not only dare to struggle against the handful of authorities within the Party who take the capitalist road but also dare to carry out self-revolution, dare to struggle against unhealthy tendencies within their own ranks, and dare to struggle against the “ego” in their minds.

	Under the loving care of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University have demolished the counter-revolutionary revisionist “Lu Family Dynasty,” giving Peking University a new life and returning its leadership to the hands of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. On the other hand, we must also be soberly aware that the old Peking University was a stubborn bourgeois fortress, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts have different degrees of reflection within our organization and in our minds. If we do not eliminate these thoughts, it will be difficult to guarantee that there will not be a second “Lu Ping,” making it difficult for the new Peking University to truly become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The “New Peking Commune” was born in the storm of revolution and should also grow in the storm. The “New Peking Commune” also faces the question of “where to go.” We must learn from the revolutionary comrades in Shanghai, open our doors wide, fight and rectify simultaneously, consciously use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly overthrow the “ego,” and transform our worldview. This is the key to our continued progress.

	Correctly Handling Comrades Who Have Been Misled and Uniting the Majority

	Comrade Zhao En Qi said: Chairman Mao teaches us that the genuine successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause “must be proletarian politicians who can unite the vast majority to work together.” Uniting the vast majority is Chairman Mao’s consistent strategic thinking and also a revolutionary necessity. As the Cultural Revolution develops to the stage of seizing power from the handful of authorities within the Party who take the capitalist road, this problem becomes even more prominent. The current issue is how to correctly handle comrades who have been misled. Due to the influence of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and the constraints of old habits, these comrades adopt conservative attitudes, stand on the wrong side, and commit various degrees of errors. However, it must be seen that most of them have already awakened, admitted their mistakes, risen up in rebellion, and returned to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. We should extend a warm hand to welcome them, help them, and not look down upon them or exclude them. Currently, some comrades still cannot get along with them, cannot have a few words when they meet, and even more cannot help and unite them. This is a manifestation of sectarianism.

	Unity is strength. Only under the banner of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, can we develop and strengthen the leftist forces, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and organize a mighty army of the proletarian cultural revolution to thoroughly strike and isolate the handful of authorities within the Party who take the capitalist road, seizing the final victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	Following Chairman Mao to Revolutionize for Life

	Comrade Xu Xi Sheng said: We are increasingly delighted and familiar with the big-character poster by the young fighters of the Red East Squad. The article grasps the active thoughts of our proletarian revolutionaries and solves the problems we urgently need to address. In the previous struggle between the two lines, we firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and bravely fought against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Now that we have seized power, our political status has fundamentally changed. Due to our lack of emphasis on the revolutionization of our thoughts and our weak struggle against various non-proletarian thoughts within the organization, these problems have become prominent after seizing power. In fact, this is the reflection of the struggle between the two lines and two thoughts within our proletarian revolutionaries. Comrade Lin Biao said: “We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize itself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be successful.” We must learn from the revolutionary comrades in Shanghai, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight and rectify simultaneously, and while seizing power from the handful of authorities within the Party who take the capitalist road, also seize power from the “ego” in our minds. We must actively study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, achieve thought revolutionization, follow Chairman Mao through wind and rain, gain experience, and revolutionize for life!

    边战斗　边学习
    灵魂深处闹革命
    新北大革命学生欢呼东方红战斗队革命的大字报
    本报讯　二月二十六日，本报刊登了《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》以及有关的评论文章以后，无产阶级革命派一致赞扬这是一篇活学活用毛主席著作的好文章，使他们受到很大的启发和教育。
    下面是“新北大公社”部分革命同志的座谈纪要。
    把毛主席的指示落实在行动上
    江溶同志说：我怀着激动的心情，读了《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》这篇活学活用毛主席著作的好文章。它之所以好，就好在“东方红”小将象32111英雄钻井队的英雄们那样，“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”他们整风的革命精神，值得全国的革命小将学习。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们所以要整风，现在要整风，将来还要整风，要不断地把我们身上的错误东西整掉，就是为了使我们能够更好地担负起这项任务，更好地同党外的一切立志改革的志士仁人共同工作。”我们新北大的革命小将，不久前，进行了一次整风，取得了一定的成绩。但是，仍然有一些同志，把整风停留在口头上，说的多，做的少，雷声大，雨点小。例如，有人借口工作忙，不肯冷静地坐下来，活学活用毛主席著作，总结前一阶段的经验教训。有的人虽然知道整风的意义，但是没有勇气向“私”字开火，正如毛主席说的那样，仅仅把箭拿在手里搓来搓去，连声赞曰：“好箭！好箭！”就是不用这些箭来射自己思想之“的”。这种态度是十分错误的。我们一定要不断地用毛泽东思想改造自己的主观世界，在灵魂深处闹革命，把我们的组织建设成一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍，使无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
    整顿思想是当前斗争的需要
    邱振东同志说：几个月来，我们团结一致，对走资本主义道路的当权派，对资产阶级反动路线狠斗狠批，取得了很大的成绩；但是不同程度地忽视了自我思想改造。同志间很少交流思想，不愿把问题亮出来，更缺乏积极的思想斗争。毛主席教导我们：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。……如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”从我们当前的整风中，我们也深深体会到：不整顿思想就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就不能做一个坚定的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    张兵同志说：《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》这张大字报提出了当前普遍存在而又迫切需要解决的问题。单纯军事观点、“材料挂帅”、关门主义等，在我们革命组织中，不同程度地存在着，有的甚至还比较严重。这些非无产阶级思想，不管其表现形式如何，本质上都是一个“私”字。在无产阶级文化大革命发展到“三结合”，联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的关键时刻，不把我们头脑里的“私”字打倒，就不能取得文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    用毛泽东思想改造世界观
    张家齐同志说：上海的革命战友敢于把大门敞开，边战斗，边整顿，是“敢”字当头的表现，是无产阶级大无畏的革命精神的表现。这种精神好得很，好极了！一切真正的无产阶级革命派，不但敢于向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争，而且敢于自我革命，敢于向自己队伍里的不良倾向作斗争，向自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，北大的革命师生摧毁了反革命修正主义的“陆家王朝”，使北大获得了新生，北大的领导权重新掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。另一方面，我们还必须清醒地认识到，旧北大是一个顽固的资产阶级堡垒，资产阶级、小资产阶级思想在我们组织内，在我们头脑里有不同程度的反映。如果不把这些思想清除掉，就难以保证不会出第二个“陆平”，就很难使新北大真正成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    “新北大公社”是在革命的暴风雨中诞生的，她也应在暴风雨中成长。“新北大公社”现在也存在“向何处去”的问题。我们必须向上海的革命战友们学习，敞开大门，边战斗边整风，自觉地以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底打倒“私”字，改造自己的世界观，这是我们继续前进的关键。正确对待受蒙蔽的同志　团结大多数
    赵恩起同志说：毛主席教导我们，真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人“他们必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家。”团结绝大多数是毛主席一贯的战略思想，也是革命的需要。文化大革命发展到向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的新阶段，这个问题就更加突出。当前的问题，是如何正确对待受蒙蔽的同志。由于资产阶级反动路线的影响和旧的习惯势力的束缚，这些同志采取保守态度，站错了队，犯了这样或那样不同程度的错误。但必须看到，他们大部分已经觉悟，承认错误，起来造反，重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来了。我们应当伸出热情的手，欢迎他们，帮助他们，而不能轻视他们，排斥他们。目前，一些同志仍然同他们合不来，见面谈不上几句话，更谈不上帮助他们，团结他们。这是一种关门主义、宗派主义的表现。
    团结就是力量，只有在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的旗帜下，发展壮大左派力量，争取中间派，团结大多数，组织浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，才能彻底打击、孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。
    跟着毛主席干一辈子革命
    许希圣同志说：东方红战斗队小将们的大字报，我们越读越高兴，越读越亲切。文章抓住了我们无产阶级革命派的活思想，解决了我们迫切需要解决的问题。在前一段两条路线的斗争中，我们坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，勇敢地同资产阶级反动路线进行斗争。现在我们掌了权，政治地位发生了根本的变化。由于我们对自己的思想革命化抓得不紧，对组织内部的各种非无产阶级思想斗争不力，因而夺权以后，这些问题就突出了。实际上这是两条路线、两种思想的斗争在我们无产阶级革命派内部的反映。林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”我们要向上海的革命战友学习，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，边战斗，边整风，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，也向自己头脑里的“私”字夺权。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，跟着毛主席经风雨，见世面，干一辈子革命！
