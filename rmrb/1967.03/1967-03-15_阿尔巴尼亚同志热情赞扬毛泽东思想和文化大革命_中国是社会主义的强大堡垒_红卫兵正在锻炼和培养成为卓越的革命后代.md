Albanian comrades have warmly praised Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. China is a powerful bastion of socialism. The Red Guards are being tempered and trained to become outstanding revolutionary successors.

	NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) — Recently returned from a visit to China, Muhammad Dana, deputy editor of the Albanian magazine "July 10th," recently wrote in the Albanian newspaper "Warrior" continuing to enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The author wrote in his article about his impressions of visiting various places in China, "The changes in the natural landscape of Shashiya Brigade in Hebei Province clearly reflect the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought. The commune members of Shashiya, in their struggle against nature, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, not only changing the face of nature but also tempering and training themselves into a new generation of revolutionaries harder than rocks."

	The author said, "Wherever I went, I saw the great achievements of Chinese peasants under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and saw that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes a tremendous material force to overcome difficulties and create miracles."

	Dana pointed out that putting politics in command and actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all victories for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Chinese People's Liberation Army actively participates in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending Marxism-Leninism, defending the people's government, and the victory of socialism.

	The author also enthusiastically praised the revolutionary youngsters who are charging at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chinese youth have become a great force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tempering and training themselves to become outstanding revolutionary successors. They have united to fight to defend proletarian ideology and thoroughly smash the bourgeois worldview."

	The author concluded by saying, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great China is a powerful bastion of socialism and a reliable defender of the freedom, independence, and peace of the peoples of all countries. The victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will make the great People's Republic of China even stronger."

    新华社地拉那电　不久前访问中国归来的阿尔巴尼亚《七月十日》杂志副总编穆罕默德·达纳耶最近在阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》上继续写文章，热情赞扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    作者在谈到他在中国各地参观访问的感想时写道，河北省沙石峪大队自然面貌的改变，清楚地反映了毛泽东思想的强大威力，沙石峪的公社社员在向大自然斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，不但改变了自然的面貌，而且把自己锻炼培养成为比岩石还坚硬的一代革命新人。
    作者说，不管走到哪里，我都看到了中国农民在毛泽东思想指导下所取得的伟大成果，看到毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就变为战胜困难、创造奇迹的巨大的物质力量。
    达纳耶指出，突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，是中国人民解放军取得一切胜利的源泉。中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大工具。中国人民解放军积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫人民政权和社会主义的胜利。
    作者还热情赞扬在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的革命小将。他说，在中国共产党的领导下，中国青年已经成为无产阶级文化大革命的一支巨大力量，正在锻炼和培养成为卓越的革命后代。他们一致起来投入了保卫无产阶级思想、彻底摧毁资产阶级世界观的斗争。
    作者最后说，在中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东思想照耀下的伟大中国，是社会主义的强大堡垒，是各国人民的自由、独立与和平的可靠保卫者。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，必将使伟大的人民中国变得更加强大。
