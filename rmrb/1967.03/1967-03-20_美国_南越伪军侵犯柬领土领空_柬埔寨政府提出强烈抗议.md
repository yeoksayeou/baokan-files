According to the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 18th, the Cambodian Kingdom's Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted two notes on the 15th and 17th through the French Embassy in Phnom Penh to the U.S. government, lodging the strongest protests against the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces' invasion of Cambodian territory and airspace.

The notes stated that on March 9, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet artillery units fiercely bombarded Ben Choung village in Pursat Province, Cambodia, burning down approximately three hectares of forest. On the same day, eight U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet aircraft strafed the village, injuring three Cambodian civilians.

The notes pointed out that prior to this, from February 19 to 28, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet aircraft had invaded Cambodian airspace five times. The notes stated that the U.S. government and the Saigon puppet regime must bear full responsibility for the extremely serious consequences caused by their repeated violations of Cambodian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also submitted two notes with the same content through the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh to the Saigon puppet regime.

    美国—南越伪军侵犯柬领土领空
    柬埔寨政府提出强烈抗议
    据新华社金边十八日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十八日报道，柬埔寨王国政府外交部十五日和十七日通过法国驻金边大使馆向美国政府提交了两份照会，最强烈抗议美国—南越伪军侵犯柬埔寨领土领空。
    照会说，三月九日，美国—南越伪军炮兵部队疯狂轰击柬埔寨磅湛省本冲村，焚毁森林约三公顷。同日，美国—南越伪军的八架飞机，又扫射了这个村庄，打伤柬埔寨居民三人。
    照会指出，在这以前从二月十九日到二十八日，美国—南越伪军的飞机曾五次侵犯柬埔寨领空。照会说，美国政府和西贡傀儡当局必须对一再侵犯柬埔寨主权和领土完整的罪恶行径所造成的极其严重的后果，承担全部责任。
    柬埔寨外交部还通过澳大利亚驻金边大使馆向西贡傀儡当局提交了内容相同的两份照会。
