	Dear Uncle,

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses have seriously criticized your mistakes, and you feel a bit disheartened, thinking that after working so hard for so many years, you still have to be "criticized." You find it hard to understand. Let us first study a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations with this question in mind! Chairman Mao said: "All our work is for the people. Our responsibility is to serve the people." Being a cadre is a trust from Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses, a call for us to serve the people better, to be the "ox" of the proletariat and the masses. Therefore, it is entirely right to endure hardships and toil in the ordinary course of things. When mistakes are made, the masses, from the standpoint of revolutionary interests and with a sense of responsibility toward comrades, criticize us. This is the greatest concern of the revolutionary masses for leading cadres. We should welcome it. Only those who are officials and lords, who take the capitalist road and are in power, can stand above the masses, act arbitrarily, and fly into a rage at the slightest criticism, even suppressing the masses. Therefore, how one deals with the masses' criticism is one of the criteria for judging whether one is a true revolutionary or a false one.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" Uncle, in the years of war, you have charged into battle, fought bravely, and won merits for the people. Today, why can't you correct your mistakes for the people's interests, with the spirit of "bayonets seeing red," fight against the "self," and win new merits for the people? I hope you will summon up courage, wage a thorough struggle against the "self" in your mind, and under the help of the revolutionary masses, completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line and quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	"Many things are urgent; time flies, and the seasons change. A thousand years is too long; we strive for every moment." The current task is the busy season for spring plowing and production. It is urgent to grasp the revolution and promote production. At this critical moment, whether one grasps the revolution and promotes production is also a dividing line between true revolutionaries and false ones. A leading cadre who has made mistakes but is willing to revolutionize should stand out at this critical moment, actively and voluntarily discuss with the poor and lower-middle peasants, discuss with all revolutionary masses, and work with them to grasp the revolution and promote spring plowing. Uncle, as long as you examine and correct your mistakes, truly grasp the revolution, and promote production, the revolutionary masses will welcome you, trust you, and actively support you. Only the handful of die-hard power-holders who take the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party wish that leading cadres at this critical moment would lose their spirit and give up. We must not fall into the enemy's trap. The revolutionary masses are the most reasonable; they say well: Revolution knows no precedence, rebellion knows no delay. Uncle, if you do not stand out now, when will you? I hope you will summon up courage, boost your spirits, dispel all kinds of misgivings, follow Chairman Mao's words, stand out, and in spring plowing and production, make amends for your past mistakes, "strive for every moment" to make revolution, "strive for every moment" to promote production, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses to fire the first shot for spring plowing and production, and win double victories in revolution and production.

	Yours,
	Wèi Fùmín

    鼓起勇气站出来狠抓革命猛促春耕
    ——解放军某部魏富民同志给叔叔的信叔叔：
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命群众对你的错误进行了严肃的批评，你感到有点灰心，认为辛辛苦苦工作这么多年，到头来还要“挨整”，有些想不通。我们先带着这个问题，学习一段毛主席语录吧！毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，……”当干部，这是毛主席和革命群众对我们的信任，是要我们更好地为人民服务，当无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”，因此，平时吃点苦，受点累是完全应该的。有了错误，人民群众从革命利益出发，本着对同志负责的精神提出批评，这是革命群众对领导干部的最大爱护，我们应该欢迎。只有那些做官当老爷的走资本主义道路当权派，才高踞于人民群众之上，专横跋扈，一听到批评就暴跳如雷，甚至压制群众。因此，如何对待群众的批评，是检验一个人真革命还是假革命的标准之一。
    毛主席教导我们：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”叔叔，你在战争的年代里，曾经冲锋陷阵，英勇杀敌，为人民立下战功。今天，你为什么就不能为了人民的利益改正错误，以“刺刀见红”的精神，向“私”字开火，为人民立新功呢？希望你鼓足勇气，大造自己头脑中“私”字的反，在革命群众的帮助下，彻底地和资产阶级反动路线决裂，迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”当前，正是春耕生产的大忙季节，狠抓革命，猛促生产，是当务之急。在这个火候上，是否狠抓革命，猛促生产，也是检验一个领导干部是真革命还是假革命的分水岭。一个犯了错误而愿意革命的领导干部，在这个节骨眼上就要站出来，积极主动地和贫下中农一起商量，和一切革命群众一起商量，和他们在一起，抓革命，促春耕。叔叔，只要你检查错误，改正错误，真正的抓革命，促生产，革命群众就会欢迎你，信任你，积极地支持你。只有党内那一小撮死心塌地走资本主义道路的当权派和地富反坏右分子才巴不得领导干部在这个节骨眼上，志气消沉，撒手不管，我们千万不要上了阶级敌人的当。革命群众最通情达理，他们说得好：革命不分先后，造反不分迟早。叔叔，现在不站出来，还待何时？希望你鼓起勇气，振作精神，打消各种顾虑，听毛主席的话，挺身而出，在春耕生产中将功补过，“只争朝夕”闹革命，“只争朝夕”搞生产，和革命群众并肩战斗，打响春耕生产第一炮，夺取革命生产双胜利。
