The news of the Party Central Committee's letter to us poor and lower-middle peasants reached the village, igniting a fire that boosted everyone's morale. Everyone was busy preparing their farming tools, ready to work hard.

Little Tiger, the warehouse keeper, felt warm-hearted too. As the saying goes, "Before the troops arrive, the supplies must be ready." If the farming tools are not fully prepared, spring farming will be affected. Little Tiger eagerly went to the team leader's house to report his plan: the plow handles need to be replaced, the millstones need to be added... He kept asking for money. Team leader Old Liang was a straightforward man. Seeing Little Tiger asking for this and that, he couldn't hold back his anger and retorted, "You're so wasteful, our team will be ruined in your hands." Little Tiger heard this, pouted, and stormed off in a huff.

Little Tiger returned to the warehouse and read a few quotations from Chairman Mao, calming his anger. He thought about the urgency of spring farming and decided that we poor and lower-middle peasants must stand up. He resolved to fix the broken farming tools himself. The news of Little Tiger wanting to fix the farming tools himself spread quickly. The landlord Zhang Toucai sneered, "A rabbit can't pull a cart, who would keep a horse? If he can do carpentry, even Lu Ban would bow to him." Old poor peasant Grandpa Geng, however, praised the news, personally visiting Little Tiger and saying, "You're the expert, I'll just watch and learn. Maybe I can lend a hand, contribute to spring farming." With Grandpa Geng's guidance, Little Tiger worked day and night, hammering and chiseling. At first, it went smoothly, but accidents happen. One slip, a misplaced hammer, and the wood board broke, causing real trouble. Starting over was not an option, and finding more wood was difficult. The young man's brows furrowed in worry.

Grandpa Geng saw all this and thought for a while before going to the team leader's office to find Old Liang. They chatted for a bit and then turned to the topic of Little Tiger. Old Liang said, "Little Tiger has only been the warehouse keeper for over a year, but he knows all the ins and outs of the farming tools and seeds, a good seedling of our poor and lower-middle peasants. But he is a bit wasteful, doesn't know how to be thrifty." Grandpa Geng continued, "The other day, I heard on the radio that the Party Central Committee sent a letter to us poor and lower-middle peasants, which said, 'The cadres at all levels of the rural people's communes should be good at consulting with the poor and lower-middle peasants, consulting with all laboring masses, and launching a spring farming production high tide.' You lack this. Now, Little Tiger is busy fixing the farming tools, isn't he responding to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call, firing the first shot for spring farming? That day, you just got angry, showed your attitude, but didn't help him come up with ideas or solutions, that's your mistake. Do you want Zhang Toucai and the others to laugh at Little Tiger?" This struck a chord with Old Liang, who couldn't sit still anymore, pulling Grandpa Geng towards the warehouse.

As soon as they entered, he shouted, "Little Tiger, I, Old Liang, need to reflect!" Little Tiger was startled, putting down his work and saying, "Team leader, you're right. Chairman Mao told us to 'be thrifty to make revolution,' but I ask for everything, that's what I should reflect on!" Seeing Little Tiger's spirit, Old Liang was pleased from the heart and immediately said, "I have a piece of material behind my house for building a room, you can take it and use it, I'll assist you." Little Tiger seized the moment and suggested, "I have an idea, let's hold a spring farming oath-taking meeting for the whole team, let our village's 'Zhuge Liang' each contribute their strategies." Old Liang raised his hands in agreement, and Grandpa Geng went to gather people, beating the drum.

"Dong... Dong... Dong..." The resonant drumbeat echoed through the steamy mountain village.

    小保管
    洪光
    党中央给咱贫下中农的信传到村里，就象点了一把火，把社员们的干劲儿鼓得足足的。大伙都忙着拾掇农具，准备大干一场。
    保管员小虎心里也热乎乎的。常言道：人马未到，粮草先行。农具不置办齐全，春耕生产就得受影响。小虎就连蹦带跳地奔到队长家里，向队长报计划：犁杖得换，碾子得添置……一个劲儿地要钱。队长老梁头是个心直口快的人。他见小虎要这要那，按不住火了，就顶了他两句：“你这么穷大手，咱队这家早晚得败在你手里。”小虎一听这话，嘟囔着嘴气冲冲地走了。
    小虎回到库房学了几条毛主席语录，心里的火压下去了，想到春耕急如星火，咱贫下中农一定得挺身而出，于是就暗自下了决心，非得把破烂的农具拾掇好。他一个字一个字地念着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”小虎要自己拾掇农具的消息很快就传开了。地主张秃子恶言恶语地说：“兔子能驾辕，谁还养活马？他要能干木匠活，那鲁班爷都得冲他作揖。”老贫农耿大爷听到这消息却满口说好，他亲自找上门来，对小虎说：“你行家看门道，我力巴头看热闹。兴许我还能使个劲儿，搭个下手，替春耕出点力。”有耿大爷的指点，小虎就白天黑夜地锤呀，凿呀。开头还挺顺当，可人有失手，马有漏蹄，一不留神，一锤打偏了，木板折了真坑人。从头干吧，木头又找不着，这小伙子眉毛起了疙瘩愁开了。
    这事儿耿大爷全看在眼里，他琢磨了一会，就上队部找老梁头去了。两人聊了一会，就扯到小虎身上来了。老梁头说：“小虎当保管才一年多，就把农具、种籽门门道道摸得清清楚楚，算得上咱贫下中农的好苗子。可他就是有点大手大脚，不会精打细算。”耿大爷接上茬说：“头天，听话匣子广播党中央给咱贫下中农来了封信，里头不就有这么一段：‘农村人民公社各级干部要善于同贫下中农一起商量，同一切劳动群众一起商量，掀起一个春耕生产的高潮。’你就缺这一条。眼下人家小虎忙着拾掇农具，不就是为了响应毛主席、党中央的号召，打响春耕第一炮吗？你那天光发火，耍态度，却不帮他出主意，想办法，这是你的不是。你想让张秃子他们看小虎哈哈是不是！”这下子可刺着了老梁头，他坐不住了，拉着耿大爷就往库房去了。
    一进门，他就嚷道：“小虎，我老梁得检讨啊！”小虎一惊，放下手里活说：“队长，你批评得对。毛主席号召我们‘要节约闹革命’，可我什么都伸手，这才该检讨呢！”队长一见小虎这股子劲，打心眼里喜欢，紧跟着说：“我家房后头还有根预备盖房的料子，你就扛来使吧，我给你打下手。”小虎趁热打铁嚷道：“我提个建议，咱全队社员开个春耕誓师会吧，让咱村的‘诸葛亮’各献计谋。”老梁头举起双手表示赞成，耿大爷敲着锣召集人去了。
    “嘡……”“嘡……”  “嘡……”宏亮的锣声在这个热气腾腾的山村回荡着。
