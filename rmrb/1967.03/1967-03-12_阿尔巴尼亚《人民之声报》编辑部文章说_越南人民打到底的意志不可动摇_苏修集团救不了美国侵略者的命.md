The editorial board of Albania's "The People's Voice" published an article on March 9 expressing support for the stern positions taken in the statements issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on February 28 and March 1, respectively. The article points out that these two statements once again demonstrate the unshakable resolve of the Vietnamese people to not lay down their arms until the last American occupier is driven out of their homeland.

The article states that the Johnson administration's escalation of aggression against Vietnam has resulted in nothing but increasingly heavy defeats. The American imperialists, in an attempt to find a way out of the encirclement by the Vietnamese military and people, continue to pursue a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy: using violence to expand their aggression on one hand, and applying pressure and blackmail on the other, in an effort to force the Vietnamese people to accept Johnson-style "peace talks." Both tactics aim to achieve the same goal of making the Vietnamese people surrender.

The article says that this plot by American imperialism has received active and comprehensive support from the Soviet revisionist leadership. It is precisely at the time when the American aggressors are escalating their attacks on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that the Soviet revisionists are strengthening their comprehensive cooperation with the U.S. government, signing new political, economic, and military treaties. While the people of South Vietnam and North Vietnam are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the American aggressors, the Khrushchev revisionists are calling on the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and accept Johnson-style "peace." Is this not a blatant betrayal of the heroic struggle for liberation by the Vietnamese people?

The article states that the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist leadership, in pursuit of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, is sacrificing the freedom and independence of the Vietnamese people and, together with American imperialism, strengthening the anti-China "encirclement." The Soviet revisionists, in order to realize this plot, are also doing their utmost to sow discord between China and Vietnam and, together with the imperialists, continue their frenzied and comprehensive anti-China campaign.

The article says that neither the savage aggression of American imperialism nor the schemes and tricks of the Johnson administration and its accomplices, the Soviet revisionists, can conquer the Vietnamese people or save the American aggressors from defeat. The heroic struggle of 31 million Vietnamese people, the reliable backing of the great Chinese people, and the powerful support of all the forces for freedom and progress in the world are the guarantees of victory for the Vietnamese people.

The article emphasizes that the only correct way to resolve the Vietnamese issue is to steadfastly implement the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The article states that in the struggle to defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country against the American aggressors and their lackeys, the Vietnamese people will forever receive the resolute internationalist support of their brothers and close comrades-in-arms—the Albanian people.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章说
    越南人民打到底的意志不可动摇
    苏修集团救不了美国侵略者的命
    新华社地拉那九日电 阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》九日发表编辑部文章表示阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国外交部分别于二月二十八日和三月一日发表的声明中的严正立场。文章指出，这两个声明再次证明了越南人民不把最后一个美国占领者从祖国领土上赶出去绝不放下武器的不可动摇的意志。
    文章说，约翰逊政府扩大对越南的侵略，除了遭到愈来愈惨重的失败以外，什么也没有捞到。美帝国主义者力图从越南军民的火力包围中寻找出路，继续推行反革命的两手策略：一边使用暴力，扩大侵略行动；一边施加压力和进行讹诈，企图强迫越南人民接受约翰逊式的“和谈”。这两手都是为了达到使越南人民屈膝投降这一个目的。
    文章说，美帝国主义这一阴谋得到苏联修正主义领导集团的积极的全面的支持。正是在美国侵略者扩大对越南民主共和国的进攻的时候，苏联修正主义者在加强同美国政府的全面合作，同它签订新的政治、经济和军事条约。当越南南方和越南北方人民同美国侵略者进行针锋相对的搏斗的时候，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者却在号召越南人民放下武器，接受约翰逊式的“和平”。这难道不是对英雄的越南人民解放战争的公开背叛吗？
    文章说，勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义领导集团为了追求苏美合作主宰世界，正在牺牲越南人民的自由和独立，并同美帝国主义一起加强反华“包围圈”。苏联修正主义者为了实现这一阴谋，还竭力在挑拨中越关系，同帝国主义者一起，继续进行疯狂的全面的反华运动。
    文章说，无论是美帝国主义的野蛮侵略，还是约翰逊政府及其同伙苏联修正主义者的阴谋诡计，都征服不了越南人民，挽救不了美国侵略者的失败。三千一百万越南人民的英勇斗争，越南人民的可靠后盾——伟大的中国人民和全世界一切爱好自由和进步的力量的有力支持，是越南人民胜利的保证。
    文章强调，解决越南问题的唯一正确途径是坚持不渝地实行越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国政府的四项主张。
    文章说，越南人民在保卫北方、解放南方、统一祖国的反对美国侵略者及其仆从的斗争中，将永远得到他们的兄弟和亲密战友——阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚决的国际主义的支持。
