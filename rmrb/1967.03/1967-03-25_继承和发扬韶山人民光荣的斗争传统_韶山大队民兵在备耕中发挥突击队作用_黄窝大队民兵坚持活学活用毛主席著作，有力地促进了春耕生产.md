The militia of Shaoshan Production Brigade in Shaoshan Commune, Hunan Province, Mao Tse-tung's home village, are responding to the great call of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production" and are playing the role of shock troops in the current spring ploughing activities. They are leading all the commune members in a swift upsurge of spring ploughing.

The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the country and to cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes reached Shaoshan. The militia were overjoyed and spread the news to each other: Chairman Mao has written to us! This is the greatest care and encouragement for us! They said, we are the militia of Chairman Mao's home village. We must carry forward and develop the glorious fighting tradition of the people of Shaoshan. We must be the vanguard in the revolution and the model in production. The militia battalion held meetings of all the militia and militia cadres, requiring the militia to play a better role in production and to strengthen public security.

The militia put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the forefront of all their work. They took the lead in studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit. They also studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "grasp revolution and promote production" and his quotations: "At present, it is the spring ploughing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve greater results than last year." After studying, the militia's revolutionary enthusiasm was greatly aroused. Under the leadership of the militia, the entire brigade established 28 study groups of Chairman Mao's works, further improving the study system. Of the 31 cadres guiding the study of Chairman Mao's works in the entire brigade, 29 are militia members.

In spring ploughing production, the militia set an example and took the lead in all aspects. They took on the difficult, heavy, and dirty jobs, with high work efficiency and good quality. Recently, the brigade conducted a spring ploughing inspection and found that the amount of human and animal manure and green manure was more and better than the same period last year, but the amount of soil and miscellaneous manure was less. Under the leadership of the militia, the entire brigade swiftly launched a campaign to accumulate manure. Many militia members braved the cold wind and rain to dig grass sods, carry pond mud, and ferment manure.

To promote the development of agricultural production, the militia of each production team decided to vigorously carry out scientific experimental activities this year, establishing seed plots, experimental plots, and high-yield plots. They are now planning the land, preparing fertilizer and tools, and the seeds for the experiment have been prepared.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 24th: The militia battalion of Huangwo Production Brigade in Lidou Commune, Xingning County, Guangdong Province, is vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the spring ploughing peak season, effectively promoting spring ploughing production.

After the spring ploughing peak season arrived, some people in this brigade thought that farm work was busy and time was tight, and suggested putting the study of Chairman Mao's works aside for a while. Some militia members and commune members also relaxed their study. The militia battalion discovered this trend, immediately consulted with the revolutionary organization of poor and lower-middle peasants, and held a meeting of all militia members and commune members. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without correct political views, one is like a soul-less body," and Lin Biao's instructions: "Study with problems in mind, apply actively, combine study with use, study first what is urgently needed, and see immediate results." They organized militia members and commune members to discuss: "Should we or should we not insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the busy farming season?" They also introduced the advanced experience of the militia members and commune members of Changyuan Production Team in this brigade who insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, carried out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution vigorously, and achieved fast and good progress in spring ploughing production. Through the study, everyone fully realized that whether to insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is a fundamental issue of whether to insist on putting politics in command and using revolution to lead production. They said, Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for grasping revolution and promoting production, and is the fundamental way to achieve the thought revolution of the people. Without the fundamental, without the guide, one will lose direction. The busier the work, the tighter the time, the heavier the tasks, the more one must study Chairman Mao's works well.

To adapt to the characteristics of the spring ploughing peak season, the militia battalion and the revolutionary organization of poor and lower-middle peasants, after research, changed the previous method of the entire battalion holding large classes and concentrated guidance to studying in platoons and squads. They also actively carried out activities such as "one helps one," "one red pair," and field guidance, learning from the experience of the Liberation Army. They often held small-scale meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, helping militia members and commune members to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, correctly handle the relationship between revolution and production, insist on using revolution to lead production, and actively shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. Now, the militia members and commune members of the brigade have high enthusiasm for production. The entire brigade's 700 mu of winter crops are well managed, and key farm work such as spring sowing, spring planting, field management, and manure accumulation are better than last year, making the brigade the one with the fastest progress and best quality in spring ploughing production in the entire commune.

    韶山大队民兵在备耕中发挥突击队作用
    黄窝大队民兵坚持活学活用毛主席著作，有力地促进了春耕生产
    新华社长沙二十四日电　伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湘潭县韶山公社韶山大队广大民兵，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在当前备耕活动中发挥突击队的作用，带动全队社员迅速掀起了备耕高潮。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》传到韶山，广大民兵欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告：毛主席他老人家来信了，这是对我们最大的关怀和鼓舞！他们说，我们是毛主席家乡的民兵，一定要继承和发扬韶山人民光荣的斗争传统，在革命中当闯将，在生产中当模范。大队民兵营先后召开了全体民兵会和民兵干部会，要求民兵在生产中更好地发挥突击作用，并加强治安保卫工作。
    民兵们把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。他们带头学习毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，大破私字，大立公字。他们还学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导和毛主席语录：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”经过学习，大大鼓舞了民兵们的革命干劲。在民兵的带动下，全大队建立了二十八个毛主席著作学习小组，进一步健全了学习制度。全大队三十一名学习毛主席著作辅导员中，有二十九名由民兵担任。
    在备耕生产中，民兵们处处起模范带头作用。他们争着作难活、重活、脏活，劳动效率高，工夫质量好。最近，大队开展了一次备耕大检查，发现人畜粪和绿肥比去年同期要多要好，但土杂肥比去年同期要少。在民兵的带动下，全大队迅速掀起了突击积肥高潮。许多民兵冒着寒风冷雨铲草皮、挑塘泥，沤氹肥。
    为了促进农业生产的发展，各个生产队的民兵还决定在今年大力开展科学实验活动，搞种子田、试验田、丰产田。现在，他们正在规划土地，准备肥料和农具，试验用的良种也已备齐。
    据新华社广州二十四日电　广东省新兴县里洞公社黄窝大队民兵营，在春耕高潮中，越忙越坚持活学活用毛主席著作，有力地促进了春耕生产。
    春耕大忙到来以后，这个大队有少数人认为农活忙，时间紧，要求把学习毛主席著作往后放放，有些民兵、社员对学习也有所放松。民兵营发现这个苗头，立即和贫下中农革命组织商量，召开全体民兵、社员大会，学习毛主席“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的教导，和林彪副主席“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的指示，组织民兵、社员讨论：“农忙要不要、能不能坚持活学活用毛主席著作？”并介绍了本大队长圹生产队民兵、社员坚持活学活用毛主席著作，按毛主席的指示办事，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈，春耕生产进度、质量又快又好的先进经验。通过学习，大家充分认识到：要不要、能不能坚持活学活用毛主席著作，是要不要、能不能坚持突出政治，用革命统帅生产的根本问题。他们说，毛泽东思想是抓革命促生产的指南，是实现人的思想革命化的根本，丢了根本，失去指南，就要迷失方向，工作越忙，时间越紧，任务越重，越要把毛主席著作学好。
    为了适应春耕大忙的特点，民兵营和贫下中农革命组织经过研究，又把过去全营上大课集中搞辅导的方法，改为以班、排为单位进行学习，同时学习解放军的经验，积极开展“一帮一”、“一对红”和田头辅导等活动。他们还经常举办活学活用毛主席著作的小型讲用会，帮助民兵和社员破私立公，正确处理革命和生产的关系，坚持用革命统帅生产，积极挑起革命、生产两副重担。现在，大队的民兵和社员生产积极性高涨，全大队七百亩冬种作物管理得很好，春种、春播、办田、积肥等关键性农活，比去年搞得要好，成为全公社春耕生产进度最快、质量最好的一个大队。
