The revolutionary people of Africa hold unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought. The more they read Chairman Mao's books, the brighter their hearts become. To make a revolution, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and engage in struggle.

A Xinhua News Agency report states that friends from several African countries recently wrote letters and made statements expressing their boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and their unlimited faith in the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.

A Ghanaian writer, Biki, who participated in the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing, said, "In the capitalist era, there was Marx; in the imperialist era, there was Lenin; in the contemporary era, there is the great Mao Zedong. To make a revolution, one needs revolutionary theory as guidance. The guiding ideology of contemporary revolution is Mao Zedong Thought."

Another Ghanaian friend, Aima, after receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly said, "Quotations from Chairman Mao is wonderful. Every word Chairman Mao says is the truth." Aima, during his visit to China, saw Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze River with his own eyes. He said, "Chairman Mao is in excellent health, which is the happiness of the revolutionary people."

A scientist from Sierra Leone wrote a letter to congratulate China on its great achievements in science and technology and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In his letter, he pointed out: "Although modern revisionists and American neocolonialists and their lackeys are closely colluding to oppose the people of the world, causing some setbacks in the revolutionary struggles in some regions, ultimately, the people will defeat this reactionary tide." He emphasized, "This reactionary tide can only make the people more vigilant in their anti-imperialist struggle." He said: "Chairman Mao pointed out, 'At present, the reactionary tide is trying to submerge the mainstream of national independence and people's democracy, but the reactionary tide will never become the mainstream.' Chairman Mao's historical judgment most accurately summarizes the feelings and thoughts of the African people who are currently opposing the American reactionaries and modern revisionists."

A young man from Niger named Bobaka said, "The more difficult the revolutionary period, the more one needs revolutionary theory as guidance, and the more one needs to strive to study the works of Chairman Mao Zedong."

A group of Somali workers who are building the Somali National Theatre with Chinese workers wrote a letter expressing their boundless respect and deep affection for Chairman Mao.

The letter said, "Today, if the revolutionary people of the world want to find the bright path to develop agriculture and industry, political power, and improve their lives, they should study the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' Without Chairman Mao's works, nothing can be solved."

The letter said: "Mao Zedong Thought has spread throughout the world. Countless revolutionary people support Chairman Mao, follow his brilliant thoughts, and bravely fight against imperialism and its lackeys, as well as its despicable henchmen—the modern revisionists." These Somali workers said: "Every time we read Chairman Mao's works, our minds become more open, and we can deeply understand his words. At this time, we feel as if he is standing right in front of us."

The Somali workers finally exclaimed, "Long live Chairman Mao! Let us advance on the brilliant path guided by Chairman Mao!"

The editor-in-chief of the Iraqi newspaper "New Dawn," Haidar Fayaz, wrote a letter to a Xinhua News Agency reporter saying: "The Chinese people deeply love their leader and commander, Chairman Mao Zedong. They are striving to learn and apply Chairman Mao's theories, regarding Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive, and implementing the great leap forward in China according to this highest directive, and also helping the people of the world to get rid of the slavery and exploitation of colonialism."

Some Algerian friends recently wrote letters wishing "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" Some people, when writing the three characters 'Mao Zedong,' drew and redrew them; some wrote in Chinese, respectfully: "Long live Chairman Mao!" A teacher named Agaha wrote in his letter: "Since the Khrushchev revisionist clique betrayed the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, all revolutionaries in the world have turned to Chairman Mao."

An Algerian youth named Majid wrote a letter saying: "I now understand that the correct path is the path of the Chinese people guided by Mao Zedong Thought."

A newspaper in Zambia said that Mao badges are becoming more and more popular among the Zambian people. A student wearing a Mao badge said: "Chairman Mao is a great statesman. We love to read his works."

	Guinea women, with excited hearts, watch pictures about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They clap their hands and happily say: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

    非洲革命人民无限信仰毛泽东思想
    越读毛主席的书心里越亮堂
    要革命就必须遵循毛主席的教导进行斗争
    新华社讯　非洲一些国家的朋友不久前纷纷写信和发表谈话，表达他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对光辉的毛泽东思想无限信仰。
    曾参加过在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的加纳作家比基说，在资本主义时代有马克思，在帝国主义时代有列宁，在当代有伟大的毛泽东。要革命就需要有革命的理论作指导，当代革命的指导思想就是毛泽东思想。
    另一位加纳朋友艾尔玛在得到《毛主席语录》后兴奋地说，《毛主席语录》太好了，毛主席说的话每句都是真理。艾尔玛在访问中国时曾亲眼看到毛主席在长江游泳。他说，毛主席身体健康极了，这是革命人民的幸福。
    塞拉勒窝内的一位科学工作者写信祝贺中国在科学技术方面和无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大成就。他在信中指出：尽管现代修正主义者同美国新殖民主义者及其走狗密切合谋，反对世界人民，使一些地区革命斗争发生一些挫折，但归根结底，人民必将战胜这个反动潮流。他强调说，这个反动潮流“只能使人民在反帝斗争中变得更加警惕”。他说：“毛主席指出，
  ‘目前反动的逆流企图压倒民族独立和人民民主的主流，但反动的逆流终究不会变为主流。’毛主席的这一历史性论断，最确切地总结了今天正在反对美国反动派和现代修正主义的非洲人民的感情和思想。”
    一位名叫波巴卡的尼日尔青年说，越是在革命的困难时期，越需要革命理论指导，越需要努力学习毛泽东主席的著作。
    正在同中国工人一起建设索马里国家剧院的一批索马里工人写信表达他们对毛主席的无限尊敬和爱戴的深厚感情。
    信中说，今天全世界革命人民要想找到发展工农业生产、政治力量和改善生活的光明大道，就应该学习《毛泽东选集》。如果没有毛主席著作，那就什么事情也解决不了。
    信中说：“毛泽东思想传遍了全世界。无数的革命人民都拥护毛主席，遵循他的光辉思想，进行英勇斗争，反对帝国主义和它的走狗以及它的卑鄙的爪牙——现代修正主义。”这些索马里工人说：“每当我们读毛主席著作的时候，我们的思想就越来越开阔，我们就能深切地理解他的话，这时候我们觉得他好象就站在我们的面前一样。”
    索马里工人们最后情不自禁地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“让我们在毛主席指引的光辉大道上迈进吧！”
    伊拉克《新黎明报》总编辑海达尔·法雅兹写信给新华社记者说：“中国人民深深地爱戴他们的领袖和统帅毛泽东主席。他们正在努力学习和运用毛主席的理论，把毛泽东思想当作最高指示，按照这个最高指示来实现中国的跃进，并且援助世界人民摆脱殖民主义的奴役和剥削。”
    一些阿尔及利亚朋友最近写信敬祝“毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”有的人在写“毛泽东”这三个字的时候，描了又描，画了又画；有的在信中用中文恭恭敬敬地写下：“毛主席万岁！”一位名叫阿格哈的教师在信中写道：“自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团背叛马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说以来，全世界革命者都心向毛主席了。”
    一位名叫马吉德的阿尔及利亚青年写信说：“我现在懂得了正确的道路就是毛泽东思想指引下的中国人民的道路。”
    赞比亚一家报纸说，毛主席像章在赞比亚人民中越来越受欢迎。一个戴着毛主席像章的学生说：
  “毛主席是一位伟大的政治家。我们爱读他的著作。”
