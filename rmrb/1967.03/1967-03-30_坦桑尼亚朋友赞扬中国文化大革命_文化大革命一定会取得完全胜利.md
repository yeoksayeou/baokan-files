A Tanzanian leader and leaders of Tanzanian trade unions, youth, and women's organizations recently expressed to Chinese trade union, youth, and women's representatives their firm belief that under the leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution will be carried through to the end and achieve final victory.

A Tanzanian leader said: The cultural revolution currently unfolding in China is a correct revolution. The Tanzanian people are sincerely concerned about China's cultural revolution and will not believe any slander against it by imperialism. He said, the imperialists oppose the Chinese cultural revolution, which proves that this revolution is very good. If the imperialists liked it, that would be a bad thing.

A leader of a Tanzanian women's organization told the Chinese women's representative: Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the Chinese people but also guides the progressive people of the whole world.

A Tanzanian trade union leader, in his talk with the Chinese trade union representative, expressed his deep conviction that the Chinese cultural revolution is of world significance and will definitely achieve complete victory.

Many Tanzanian youths praised the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution as being very good and expressed their firm belief that the Chinese youth, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, will definitely carry the cultural revolution through to the end and achieve final victory. They also asked the Chinese youth representatives to convey their warm greetings to the Chinese youth who are actively participating in the cultural revolution, especially to the Red Guards. A leader of a Tanzanian youth organization, upon hearing of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the excellent situation of the Chinese cultural revolution, expressed his great joy. He said, the Tanzanian youth will, like the Chinese youth, defend and build their country.

    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚的一位领导人以及坦桑尼亚工会、青年和妇女团体的领导人不久前向中国工会、青年和妇女代表表示坚信在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，中国的无产阶级文化大革命将进行到底，并取得最后胜利。
    坦桑尼亚的一位领导人说：目前在中国开展的文化大革命是一场正确的革命。坦桑尼亚人民非常真诚地关注着中国的文化大革命，不会相信帝国主义对中国文化大革命的任何诬蔑。他说，帝国主义者反对中国文化大革命，这证明这场革命好得很，假如帝国主义者喜欢它，那就是一件坏事了。
    坦桑尼亚妇女团体的一位领导人对中国妇女代表说：毛泽东思想不仅指导着中国人民，而且指导着全世界的进步人民。
    坦桑尼亚的一位工会领导人在同中国工会代表的谈话中表示，他深信中国的文化大革命是具有世界意义的，一定会取得完全胜利。
    许多坦桑尼亚青年赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很，表示深信中国青年在毛主席的领导下，一定会把文化大革命进行到底，取得最后胜利。他们还要中国青年代表向积极参加文化大革命的中国青年，特别是向中国红卫兵转达他们热烈的问候。坦桑尼亚青年团体的一位领导人在听到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利和中国的文化大革命呈现一片大好形势之后表示十分高兴。他说，坦桑尼亚青年将象中国青年一样保卫祖国和建设祖国。
