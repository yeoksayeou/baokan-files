I worked as a leader at the *Mountain West Four Cleanups* newspaper, which was established by the original Shanxi Provincial Committee. Although I was long subjected to the exclusion of a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, I felt that I was a mid-level cadre and dared not boldly stand up to fight against them. In January of this year, our unit exposed the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of a small clique within the provincial committee, which made me suddenly realize the truth. To be loyal to Chairman Mao and to defend Chairman Mao, I decided to stand tall and fight the revolution. I joined the Shanxi Revolutionary Cadre Rebel Corps and participated in the seizure and control of power in our unit. However, on the other hand, some "protection" types cursed me with phrases like "political opportunist" and "political thief." At that time, I did not recognize the nature of these people, and hearing these words put a lot of pressure on me; every step forward was taken with a heavy heart. I wanted to give some ideas to the revolutionary youngsters, but I was afraid that people would say I was manipulating the masses.

Studying the editorial from the third issue of *Red Flag* magazine helped me put down this burden; the editorial from the fourth issue further inspired my revolutionary enthusiasm. Now, I feel that my revolutionary spirit is far from that of the revolutionary youngsters in our unit. In the future, I will actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, thoroughly eliminate selfish thoughts, and seriously learn from the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary youngsters. I will fight shoulder to shoulder with them to overthrow the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and dedicate myself to building a bright socialist new China and serving the world's revolutionary people!

    放下包袱　轻装上阵
    王祠
    我在原山西省委创办的《山西四清报》作过领导工作。虽然长期受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的排斥，但又感到自己是中层干部，不敢大胆站出来同他们斗争。今年一月，我们机关揭出了省委内一小撮人反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，这使我猛醒。为了忠于毛主席，保卫毛主席，我决心挺起腰杆干革命。我参加了山西革命干部造反兵团，参加了本单位的夺权和掌权斗争。但另一面，一些“保”字号的人，却用
  “政治投机”、“政治扒手”等骂我。当时，我对这些人的面貌认识不清，听了这些话，压力很大，每向前走一步，总是心事重重；想给革命小将出点子，又怕人家说自己在左右群众。
    学习了《红旗》杂志第三期社论，使我放下了这个包袱；第四期社论，更加鼓舞了我的革命积极性。现在，我感到我的革命精神，远不如我们机关的革命小将们。今后，我要活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，彻底清除私心杂念，认真学习革命小将们的革命精神，和他们并肩战斗，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打倒，为建设一个鲜红鲜红的社会主义的新中国，为世界革命人民服务而鞠躬尽瘁！
