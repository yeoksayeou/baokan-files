On March 20 and 21, the American bandit leader Johnson, along with his civilian and military officials, and the puppet leader of South Vietnam, held a two-day secret meeting on Guam. This was a high-level decision-making meeting of the Johnson administration to discuss further escalation of the Vietnam War, a war conference filled with the smell of gunpowder and sharpening of swords.

Johnson acknowledged in his speech upon leaving Guam that the primary agenda of the meeting was the "military aspect" of Vietnam, "including both the South and the North." Johnson's advisors also announced to reporters on Guam that "the United States will greatly strengthen the war in Vietnam," and that the decision to escalate has been made.

Although the U.S. government has been tight-lipped about the specific content of the meeting, according to reports from Western news agencies, the military deployments made by the United States at the Guam meeting mainly include:

	* In South Vietnam, the United States will continue to "deploy more ground troops" and has formulated a "new plan for actions on an unprecedented scale against Viet Cong areas";
	* In North Vietnam, the United States will add new "targets" to the "list of bombing targets" and "greatly intensify bombing";
	* The U.S. B-52 strategic bombers stationed in the western Pacific will be moved to bases in Thailand to bomb both South and North Vietnam;
	* On both sides of the border in South Vietnam, military efforts will be strengthened, expanding the war to Laos and Cambodia.

	It is particularly noteworthy that, according to a March 21 report by the United Press International, the Johnson administration, in order to "greatly strengthen" the Vietnam War, is also plotting to "establish a defensive line north of the 17th parallel," which would require attacking North Vietnam.

	It is clear that U.S. imperialism is not willing to accept defeat in South Vietnam and is preparing for new military adventures. U.S. imperialism not only intends to continue its rampage in Vietnam but also aims to expand the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula, to the entire Southeast Asia, and even to China.

	At the Guam meeting, the U.S. imperialist leaders and the South Vietnamese puppets also discussed the so-called "pacification plan" for South Vietnam and other issues such as "representative government." These tricks are all intended to complement the U.S. imperialists' plans to further escalate the Vietnam War.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas." The Guam meeting once again proves this immutable truth. U.S. imperialism will never withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, will never stop its armed aggression against Vietnam, and will never abandon its evil goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam.

	While Johnson is hastening to escalate the war, he is also loudly calling for a so-called "honorable peace" in Vietnam. What is "honorable peace"? In essence, it is to force the Vietnamese people to surrender under the military pressure of the U.S. invaders. "Forcing surrender through war" is the plan Johnson had in mind at the Guam meeting.

	This big bandit Johnson brandishes his blood-stained butcher knife, attempting to force the heroic Vietnamese people to hand over half of their country to the U.S. invaders, attempting to force the people of North Vietnam to watch their fellow countrymen in the South be slaughtered by the U.S. invaders, and attempting to force the great Vietnamese nation to abandon the sacred goal of national liberation and national reunification for which they have fought and sacrificed for generations. U.S. imperialism is simply too arrogant and too brazen!

	The reason why U.S. imperialism dares to be so arrogant is that it has the encouragement and cooperation of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet revisionist leaders are doing their utmost to promote the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy, colluding with U.S. imperialism to put pressure on the Vietnamese people and undermine the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. They also spread anti-China rumors, attempting to sow discord between the great fighting friendship of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. Especially shortly before the Guam meeting, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin went to London and engaged in the dirty deal of openly betraying the Vietnamese people's revolutionary cause. This greatly stimulated the U.S. imperialists' appetite for aggression and fanned the flames of their war of aggression. Currently, the Soviet revisionists are engaged in intense backstage activities with the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, on the one hand covering up the U.S. conspiracy to escalate the war, and on the other hand forcing the Vietnamese people to beg for peace from the U.S. aggressors. This once again proves that the Soviet revisionist leaders are the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and Asia.

	However, the upright Vietnamese people are not afraid and cannot be crushed. After several years of struggle, they have exposed the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism with their victorious battles. The heroic Vietnamese people have fully demonstrated the power of people's war, greatly enriching the experience of people's war, and becoming more and more courageous and stronger in their struggle against the U.S. aggressors. They have tied down more than 400,000 U.S. aggressor troops, beating the U.S. imperialists until they are bruised and exhausted, at their wits' end. This is a miracle in the history of war, a great feat of the Vietnamese people, and a magnificent achievement that shakes heaven and earth. The power of the Vietnamese people is boundless; they can fight generation after generation on their own land. However, U.S. imperialism does not have the strength to drag on in the South Vietnamese battlefield for a long time. Johnson's ferocious and aggressive behavior at the Guam meeting is actually like a desperate gambler who is placing all his bets in a last-ditch effort to turn the tables, hoping to solve the Vietnam War in a short period by escalating the war. As a Western journalist put it, Johnson "hopes" to reverse the U.S. defeat in South Vietnam this year and force a "peace talk." This precisely exposes the fatal weakness of U.S. imperialism's extreme fear of this war dragging on for a long time.

	Currently, the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is very good. The U.S. aggressors are facing insurmountable difficulties, and they can only be arrogant for a while but cannot escape the fate of complete failure. As long as the Vietnamese people insist on the war of national salvation against U.S. aggression, hold on to the U.S. aggressors, and fight a protracted war, they will definitely be able to wear down and kill this beast of U.S. aggression.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "After crossing the difficult path of war, the road to victory will open up, this is the natural logic of war." The logic of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation will also be like this. As long as they are determined to persist in the just war of national salvation against U.S. aggression, they will definitely achieve the final and complete victory.

	China and Vietnam are brothers and neighbors who depend on each other. Socialist China is the strongest and most reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The great proletarian cultural revolution that is currently underway is making China more consolidated, stronger, and more powerful to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the 700 million Chinese people are closely watching the developments in Vietnam, ready to make the greatest national sacrifices at any time to make greater contributions to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. We must sternly warn U.S. imperialism that in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, your conspiracy to "force surrender through war" will never succeed. Your further escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam will only lead to greater failure and hasten your doom!

    美帝扩大侵越战争的黑会
    观察家
    三月二十日和二十一日，美国强盗头子约翰逊率领他的文臣武将，并召去南越傀儡头目，在关岛开了两天黑会。这是约翰逊政府讨论进一步扩大侵越战争的一次高级决策的会议，是一次充满着火药味道的、磨刀霍霍的战争会议。
    约翰逊在离开关岛时发表的讲话里承认，会议上的首要议题，就是越南“军事方面”的问题，“包括在南方和北方”。约翰逊的顾问在关岛也已经向记者宣布，“美国将大大加强越南的战争”，“升级的决定已经作出”。
    尽管美国官方对会议的具体内容讳莫如深，但是，根据西方通讯社的报道，美国在关岛会议上所作的军事部署主要有：
    在越南南方，美国将继续“增派地面部队”，并已制定了“以空前的规模向越共地区发动攻击”的“新行动的计划”；
    对越南北方，美国将在“袭击的目标清单”中增加新的“目标”，“大大加强轰炸”；
    驻在西太平洋的美国B—52型战略轰炸机，将移到泰国基地，轰炸越南南方和北方；
    在南越“边界两侧加强军事努力”，把战火扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。
    特别值得注意的是，据美新处三月二十一日透露，约翰逊政府为了“大大加强”越南战争，还策划“在十七度线以北建立一道防线”，“这样就需要进攻北越”。
    很明显，美帝国主义对它在南越战场上的失败，是决不甘心的，它还要进行疯狂的挣扎，准备发动新的军事冒险。美帝国主义不仅要在越南继续蛮干下去，而且企图把战争进一步扩大到整个印度支那，扩大到整个东南亚，甚至扩大到中国。
    在关岛会议上，美帝国主义头目和南越傀儡还讨论了所谓南越的“绥靖计划”和什么“代议制政府”之类的问题。这些鬼把戏，统统都是为了配合美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争的部署。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛”。关岛会议又一次证明了这个颠扑不破的真理。美帝国主义决不会把美国侵略军乖乖地从越南南方撤走，决不会自动地停止它对越南的武装侵略，决不会自动放弃它永远霸占越南南方的罪恶目的。
    约翰逊在加紧扩大战争的同时，又大嚷要在越南“寻求”所谓“体面的和平”。什么是“体面的和平”呢？说穿了，就是要越南人民在美国侵略者的军事压力下屈膝投降。“以战迫降”，这就是约翰逊在关岛会议上所打的如意算盘。
    约翰逊这个大强盗举起血淋淋的屠刀，妄想迫使英雄的越南人民把祖国的半壁河山拱手奉献给美国侵略者，妄想迫使越南北方的人民坐视自己南方的骨肉同胞任凭美国侵略者宰割，妄想迫使伟大的越南民族放弃多少年来流血牺牲为之奋斗的争取民族解放和国家统一的神圣目标。美帝国主义简直太狂妄，太嚣张了！
    美帝国主义所以敢于如此嚣张，是由于得到苏联修正主义领导集团的鼓励和配合。苏修领导集团竭力为美国的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳，同美帝国主义里应外合，向越南人民施加压力，破坏越南人民的抗美救国斗争。他们还大肆散布反华谣言，力图挑拨中越人民伟大的战斗友谊。特别是在关岛会议前不久，苏修头目柯西金到伦敦，进行了公开叛卖越南人民革命事业的肮脏勾当，这就大大地刺激了美帝国主义的侵略胃口，助长了美帝国主义的战争凶焰。目前，苏修正在同联合国秘书长吴丹进行着紧张的幕后活动，一方面为美国扩大战争的阴谋打掩护，一方面迫使越南人民向美国侵略者乞和。这又一次证明苏修领导集团是美帝国主义侵略越南和侵略亚洲的头号帮凶。
    但是，顶天立地的越南人民是吓不倒、压不垮的。经过几年的较量，他们已经用自己的胜利的战斗，戳穿了美帝国主义的纸老虎本质。英雄的越南人民充分发挥了人民战争的威力，大大丰富了人民战争的经验，在同美国侵略者的搏斗中，越战越勇，越战越强。他们拖住了四十几万美国侵略军，把美帝国主义打得鼻青脸肿，精疲力尽，一筹莫展。这是战争史上的奇观，越南人民的创举，惊天动地的伟业。越南人民的力量是无穷无尽的，他们可以在自己祖国土地上世世代代地打下去。然而，美帝国主义却没有力量在南越战场上长期拖下去。约翰逊在关岛会议上穷凶极恶、张牙舞爪，实际上象一个输急了的赌徒拚命下赌注企图翻本一样，妄想用加紧战争“升级”在短期内解决越南战争。用西方记者的话来说，约翰逊“希望”在今年内挽回美国在南越战场上的败局，压出一个“和谈”来。这恰恰暴露了美帝国主义极端害怕这场战争旷日持久地拖下去的致命弱点。
    目前，越南人民的抗美救国斗争形势好得很。美国侵略者正面临着无法克服的重重困难，它尽可以嚣张一时，但是绝对逃不脱彻底失败的命运。越南人民只要坚持抗美救国战争，揪住美国侵略者不放，同它持久而战，就一定能够把美国侵略者这只野兽拖垮、拖死。
    毛主席教导我们：“跨过战争的艰难路程之后，胜利的坦途就到来了，这是战争的自然逻辑。”越南人民抗美救国战争的逻辑也必然是这样。只要下定决心把抗美救国的正义战争坚持下去，就一定能够取得最后的彻底的胜利。
    中国和越南是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦。社会主义的中国是越南人民抗美救国战争最强大、最可靠的后方基地。正在轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命，使中国更加巩固，更加强大，更有力量来支援兄弟的越南人民的正义斗争。在伟大的统帅毛泽东主席领导下的七亿中国人民，正密切地注视着越南局势的发展，随时准备作出最大的民族牺牲，为支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国斗争作出更大的贡献。我们要严厉警告美帝国主义，在英雄的越南人民面前，你们“以战迫降”的阴谋是决不能得逞的。你们进一步扩大侵越战争，只能遭到更大的失败，加速你们的灭亡！
