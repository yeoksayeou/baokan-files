Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
March 5, 1967

On February 28, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement exposing the crimes of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against South Vietnam and reaffirming the stance of the five-point statement issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on March 22, 1965. It called on the people of South Vietnam to press forward and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors. On March 1, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement, severely condemning the U.S. imperialists' new "escalation" of the war in North Vietnam and expressing the Vietnamese people's determination to fight resolutely. This is the solemn pledge of the 31 million heroic sons and daughters of Vietnam in the current new situation of their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' new military blackmail.

The Chinese government and people fully support the firm stance of the heroic Vietnamese people!

In recent times, U.S. imperialism has frantically intensified its aggression against Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the number of U.S. aggression troops has increased to over 400,000, and they are launching an unprecedented "dry season offensive" against the liberated areas, further escalating their policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all." In North Vietnam, the U.S. bandits not only intensified their bombing but also openly carried out new escalations, continuously shelling the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from land and sea, and dropping mines into many rivers in North Vietnam. To support the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has deployed B-52 bombers to Thailand, expanded its aggression against Laos, and intensified armed provocations against Cambodia. The U.S. bandit leader Johnson boasted, "The pressure must continue," "The U.S. must firmly stick to the current path," "The U.S. will firmly stay in Vietnam," etc. The arrogance of U.S. imperialism has reached an unprecedented level.

While escalating the war of aggression, U.S. imperialism has consistently played both ends against the middle, playing the "peace talks" trick. This year in February, the Johnson administration loudly proclaimed that as long as Vietnam takes "reciprocal actions" and "gradually de-escalates" militarily, the U.S. can "stop bombing North Vietnam," etc., attempting to use the "stop bombing" to induce the Vietnamese people to accept the U.S. negotiation conditions. After the U.S. imperialists' "stop bombing" trick to induce surrender failed, they intensified their war machine, conducting new military blackmail against the Vietnamese people, demanding that the Vietnamese people stop fighting, lay down their arms, and surrender, in order to achieve their goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam and dividing Vietnam.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has always actively collaborated with U.S. imperialism in pushing the "peace talks" trick, serving U.S. imperialism. At the beginning of February, during Kosygin's visit to England, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique engaged in blatant betrayal activities. They remained silent about the U.S. imperialists' crimes of aggression against Vietnam, instead shouting about "ending the Vietnam War as soon as possible." They exchanged information with U.S. imperialism, conspiring together, and using every means to induce the Vietnamese people to fall into the U.S. "peace talks" trap. To confuse the issue, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique also cried wolf, fabricating anti-China rumors on the issue of "transit of aid to Vietnam," stirring up trouble between China and Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique's evil activities have thoroughly exposed them as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and as great betrayers of the Vietnamese people.

The Vietnamese people are a heroic people, a people who fear no tyranny, dare to struggle, and dare to win. Currently, the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism has already fallen into the vast sea of people's war in Vietnam, mired in the mud, unable to advance or retreat. The temporary rampage of U.S. imperialism does not indicate its strength but rather its weakness. Facing the U.S. imperialists' new "escalation" of the war, the Vietnamese people have given a resounding response. The statement of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28 said: "The people of South Vietnam love peace, but as long as there are U.S. aggressor troops on their beloved homeland, they will never lay down their arms!" The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 1 said: "The Vietnamese people will further strengthen their unity, fight resolutely, defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country, contributing to the defense of peace in Asia and the world." Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." Currently, the situation of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam is proving this truth. No matter how U.S. imperialism escalates the war and plays political deception, it cannot shake the iron will of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. U.S. imperialism cannot escape its ultimate failure.

The Chinese government and people have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, considering it our internationalist duty to support the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people. China is the rear base of Vietnam. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China will make China even stronger and more consolidated. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are closely watching the new developments in the Vietnamese situation and are ready at any time to make greater contributions to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle. No matter what storms and waves may arise, the peoples of China and Vietnam will forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

    毛泽东思想武装的七亿中国人民最坚决地支持越南兄弟抗美到底
    强烈谴责美帝对越南的新的军事讹诈和苏修领导集团的叛卖活动
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部五日发表声明，最坚决地支持英雄的越南人民坚决战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者的严正立场；强烈谴责美帝国主义在扩大侵越战争的同时，一贯施展反革命两手，玩弄“和谈”阴谋以及苏联修正主义领导集团，一向积极配合美帝国主义推行“和谈”阴谋，为美帝国主义效劳。声明重申，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，正密切注视着越南局势的新发展，随时准备为支援越南人民的正义斗争作出更大的贡献。不论出现什么惊涛骇浪，中越两国人民将永远团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                      一九六七年三月五日
    二月二十八日，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发表声明，以大量事实揭露了美帝国主义侵略越南南方的罪行，重申了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六五年三月二十二日五点声明的立场，号召越南南方人民勇往直前，彻底打败美国侵略者。三月一日，越南民主共和国外交部发表声明，严厉谴责了美帝国主义在越南北方新的战争“升级”行动，表达了越南人民坚决战斗的决心。这是越南三千一百万英雄儿女在当前抗美救国斗争新形势下发出的庄严誓言，是对美帝国主义新的战争讹诈的有力回答。
    中国政府和中国人民对英雄越南人民的严正立场，表示最坚决的支持！
    最近以来，美帝国主义疯狂地加紧扩大对越南的侵略战争。在越南南方，美国侵略军已增至四十多万人，它们正向解放区发动规模空前的所谓“旱季攻势”，更加变本加厉地实行杀光、烧光、毁光的三光政策。在越南北方，美国强盗不仅加紧进行狂轰滥炸，并且公然采取了新的战争升级，从陆地和海上连续轰击越南民主共和国领土，向越南北方许多河流投放水雷。为了配合侵略越南的战争，美帝国主义在越南周围地区派遣B—52型飞机进驻泰国，扩大对老挝的侵略，加紧对柬埔寨进行武装挑衅。美国强盗头子约翰逊叫嚷：“压力必须持续下去”，美国“必须坚定地沿着目前道路走下去”，美国“将坚定呆在越南”，等等。美帝国主义的侵略气焰达到空前嚣张的程度。
    美帝国主义在扩大侵略战争的同时，一贯施展反革命两手，玩弄“和谈”阴谋。今年二月，约翰逊政府大肆叫嚷：只要越南采取“对等行动”，在军事上“逐步降级”，美国就可以“停止对北越的轰炸”，等等，企图用“停炸”来诱使越南人民接受美国的谈判条件。美帝国主义“停炸”诱降的阴谋遭到破产以后，就加紧开动战争机器，向越南人民进行新的军事讹诈，要越南人民停止战斗，放下武器，屈膝投降，以达到它永久霸占南越、分裂越南的目的。
    苏联修正主义领导集团，一向积极配合美帝国主义推行“和谈”阴谋，为美帝国主义效劳。今年二月初柯西金访英期间，苏修领导集团进行了露骨的叛卖活动。他们对美帝侵略越南的罪行一声不吭，反而叫喊什么“及早结束越南战争”。他们同美帝国主义互通信息，共同密谋，千方百计地要诱使越南人民堕入美国的“和谈”圈套。为混淆视听，苏修领导集团还贼喊捉贼，在“援越物资过境”问题上，捏造反华谣言，挑拨中越关系。苏修领导集团的这些罪恶活动，彻底地暴露了他们是美帝国主义侵略越南的头号帮凶，是出卖越南人民的大叛徒。
    越南人民是英雄的人民，是不畏强暴、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人民。目前，貌似强大的美帝国主义，在越南早已堕入人民战争的汪洋大海，泥足深陷，进退维谷。美帝国主义的一时猖獗，并不说明它的强大，而是说明它的虚弱。面对着美帝国主义新的战争“升级”，越南人民已经做出了响亮的回答。越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会二月二十八日声明中说：“越南南方人民是热爱和平的，但是，只要他们可爱的祖国的国土上还有美国侵略军的时候，他们就决不会放下武器！”越南民主共和国外交部三月一日的声明中说：“越南人民将进一步加强团结，坚决战斗，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献”。毛泽东主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的”。当前，美帝国主义在越南的处境，正在证明这个真理。不论美帝国主义怎样进行战争升级和玩弄政治欺骗，都不能动摇越南人民抗美救国斗争的钢铁意志，美帝国主义绝不能逃脱它最后失败的命运。
    中国政府和中国人民，一贯遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把支援越南人民的革命斗争，看作是自己应尽的国际主义义务。中国是越南的后方，目前正在轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命必将使中国更加强大，更加巩固。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，正密切注视着越南局势的新发展，随时准备为支援越南人民的正义斗争作出更大的贡献。不论出现什么惊涛骇浪，中越两国人民将永远团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。
