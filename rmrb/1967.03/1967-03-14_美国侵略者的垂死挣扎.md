American aggressor planes bombed the second-largest city in North Vietnam, Haiphong, and the important industrial city of Taiyuan on March 10 and 11, and then brazenly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, on March 12. This is another escalation of the war by American imperialism in Vietnam, and a new heinous crime committed against the Vietnamese people.

In recent times, American imperialism has been frantically expanding the war in Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the American aggressors have been continuously increasing their troops and launching large-scale "sweeps" against liberated areas. In North Vietnam, the American bandits have been escalating their indiscriminate bombing and have been continuously attacking Vietnamese territory from land and sea, and laying mines in many rivers. Now, American aggressor planes have bombed Haiphong, Taiyuan, and the city of Hanoi. The facts once again prove that American imperialism's talk of "peace talks" is merely a smokescreen. Under the cover of its "peace talks" plot, it is brazenly expanding the war in Vietnam.

A month ago, American imperialism staged a "bombing halt" plot to entice surrender. This plot failed, so it has now resorted to blatant military blackmail against the Vietnamese people. The American bandit leader Johnson has repeatedly threatened that "pressure on the Vietnamese people must continue," and that the United States "must firmly follow the current path." On March 9, Johnson again declared that "we cannot stop half of the war"; he claimed that only if the people of North Vietnam "stop their aggression against South Vietnam" will the United States stop bombing. It is clear that American imperialism is deluded into thinking that it can use the tactic of intensified bombing to blackmail the Vietnamese people into stopping their struggle against American aggression and surrendering to the aggressors, thereby achieving its evil goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam and dividing Vietnam.

To occupy South Vietnam, American imperialism has been playing a counter-revolutionary two-handed game. One hand is expanding the war, and the other is pushing the "peace talks" deception. When it cannot continue the war, it engages in "peace talks" plots, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to sign a treaty of surrender. When the "peace talks" plot fails, it continues to expand the war. It uses "peace talks" to cover up the expansion of the war and uses the expansion of the war to pressure for peace. This fully proves that American imperialism's policy of aggression and war will not change.

The arrogance of American imperialism's aggression is inseparable from the treacherous activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership. In recent times, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been particularly active in serving American imperialism's "peace talks" plot and has repeatedly vilely fabricated anti-China rumors, attempting to sow discord between China and Vietnam. This despicable activity has greatly aided American imperialism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rampancy of all dark forces not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows that they are in their last struggles, indicating that the people are gradually approaching victory." American imperialism has long been engulfed in the people's war in Vietnam and is facing annihilation. Its current frenzied expansion of the war of aggression is a desperate struggle in its final throes. The Vietnamese people are a heroic people who cannot be deceived by the "peace talks" plot and cannot be intimidated by the escalation of the war. American imperialism's intensification of the war of aggression will only receive more powerful counterattacks from the Vietnamese people and will only receive greater condemnation from the revolutionary people of the world, leading to even more disastrous defeats for the American aggressors.

The Chinese people have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression as their internationalist duty. The Chinese people firmly support the strong protest of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 11 against the American aggressors, firmly support the Vietnamese people's resolute determination to fight to the end, and are ready at any time to make greater contributions to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression.

Victory to Vietnam! Defeat to American imperialism!

    美国侵略者的垂死挣扎
    本报评论员
    美国强盗飞机在三月十日和十一日连续轰炸越南北方第二大城市海防和重要工业城市太原，十二日又悍然轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市区。这是美帝国主义在越南的又一次战争“升级”行动，是它对越南人民犯下的新的滔天罪行。
    最近以来，美帝国主义疯狂地加紧扩大侵越战争。在越南南方，美国侵略军不断增兵，并且连续向解放区发动大规模的“扫荡”。在越南北方，美国强盗变本加厉地进行狂轰滥炸，并且接连从陆地和海上轰击越南民主共和国领土，向越南北方许多河流投放水雷。现在美国强盗飞机又对海防、太原和河内市区进行轰炸。事实再一次证明，美帝国主义大谈“和谈”，不过是一个烟幕，它正在“和谈”阴谋的掩盖下，猖狂地扩大侵越战争。
    美帝国主义在一个月前玩弄了一次“停炸”诱降的阴谋。这次阴谋破产了，它就又对越南人民进行露骨的军事讹诈。美国强盗头子约翰逊不久前一再叫嚣，对越南人民的“压力必须坚持下去”，美国“必须坚定地沿着目前道路走下去”。三月九日，约翰逊又叫嚷“不能把战争的一半停下来”；声称只有越南北方人民“停止他们对南越的侵犯”，美国才会停止轰炸。很明显，美帝国主义妄想用加强轰炸的讹诈手法，要越南人民停止抗美救国斗争，向侵略者屈膝投降，以达到它永远霸占南越、分裂越南的罪恶目的。
    美帝国主义为了霸占越南南方，一直玩弄反革命两手。一手是扩大战争，一手是推行“和谈”骗局。它打不下去了，就大搞“和谈”阴谋，企图迫使越南人民订立城下之盟。“和谈”阴谋没有得逞，它就继续扩大战争。它既用“和谈”来掩护扩大战争，又用扩大战争来压和。这充分证明，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，是绝对不会改变的。
    美帝国主义侵略气焰的嚣张，同苏联修正主义领导集团的叛卖活动，是分不开的。最近时期，苏修领导集团特别起劲地为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋效劳，并且一再卑劣地捏造反华谣言，妄图挑拨中越两国关系。这种卑鄙的活动，给美帝国主义帮了大忙。
    毛主席教导我们：一切黑暗势力的猖獗，“不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利”。美帝国主义在越南早就堕入人民战争的汪洋大海，面临着灭顶之灾。它目前疯狂地扩大侵略战争，正是它在绝境中的一种垂死挣扎。越南人民是英雄的人民，是“和谈”阴谋所骗不了的，也是战争“升级”所吓不倒的。美帝国主义加紧扩大侵略战争，只能受到越南人民更有力的反击，只能受到全世界革命人民更大的谴责，使美国侵略者自己遭到更惨的失败。
    中国人民一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，看作自己应尽的国际主义义务。中国人民坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部三月十一日声明对美国侵略者的强烈抗议，坚决支持越南人民抗战到底的坚定决心，并且随时准备为支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争作出更大的贡献。
    越南必胜！美帝必败！
