The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9, after achieving victory in seizing power, has conducted a rectification campaign to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, unifying thoughts. Under the great banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary organizations of the entire mill, from the mill level, workshops, to production teams, have been organized layer by layer according to departments and systems, achieving a genuine great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

Originally, there were 23 revolutionary rebel corps that crossed departments and workshops, which united to form a unified revolutionary organization on February 11. This revolutionary organization, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary "three-in-one" leading core, is currently uniting the majority of the mill's workers and cadres, forming a vast proletarian revolutionary army. This revolutionary army, in the struggle against a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the mill, has concentrated firepower and is invincible; the revolution is booming and vibrant. At the same time, due to convenient command and unified steps, the production front is also bustling with activity, and good news is frequently reported. In February, the mill's main products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and printing and dyeing all exceeded the state plan.

Recently, the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee summarized and promoted the mill's experience of layer-by-layer organizational unification, calling on all industrial and mining enterprises in the city to learn from them and gradually achieve great unity according to departments and systems.

The Inevitable Trend of Revolutionary Development

On January 19, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9 achieved initial great unity and seized all power from a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. After the victory of seizing power, the revolutionary ranks continued to expand, eventually developing into a situation where 23 revolutionary organizations jointly held power.

Before the victory of seizing power, the mill's revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses broke through the white terror imposed by a small handful of capitalist-roaders and the numerous obstacles set up by the bourgeois reactionary line, crossed departmental and systemic boundaries to make revolution, and established immortal merits. After the victory of seizing power, when the 23 revolutionary organizations jointly held power, many contradictions were exposed. For example, in the matter of leadership, each organization wanted to send more representatives to the mill revolutionary committee; each workshop had several to as many as ten revolutionary organizations, and each time a meeting was held, each organization wanted to control the meeting, often arguing over this; some organizations, starting from the interests of small cliques, competed for development objects, and organizations often quarreled over this, often causing great disunity; the 23 organizations each formed their own system and acted independently, and many issues often could not reach an agreement. If this situation continued, the initial great unity formed in the struggle to seize power would be in danger of breaking at any time.

The organizational form of cross-departmental and cross-workshop alliances was also very unfavorable for implementing the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" after the proletarian revolutionary faction jointly held power, and was not conducive to the struggle, criticism, and reform of this unit. Many workshops in this mill, when further criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, because each revolutionary organization wanted to take the stage, sometimes had to take turns criticizing, resulting in scattered firepower, weak momentum, and meager results. Some workshops even delayed the struggle, criticism, and reform because the two sides could not reach a consensus. In terms of production, because the workers of a workshop and a team were often scattered among several revolutionary organizations, many problems were difficult to solve. The North Dyeing Tank Team of the Dyeing Workshop had 13 workers belonging to five combat corps, and team meetings could not be held. Before achieving great unity according to departments and systems, due to many organizations and chaotic threads, the instructions and resolutions of the mill revolutionary committee could not be promptly implemented, resulting in inconvenient command, inconvenient dispatch, inconsistent steps, and affecting the smooth progress of the revolution and production.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary comrades who came out of the white terror imposed by a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, with the problems existing after the victory of seizing power, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the unity and unity of the revolutionary ranks, gradually realizing the harm of cross-departmental alliances, and deeply felt: "The character 'self' is the root of splitism and cliquism; the scattered organizational form is the soil that produces splitism and cliquism. To thoroughly correct the erroneous tendencies of splitism and cliquism, we must not only uproot the root of the character 'self,' but also eliminate the soil that nurtures it." Therefore, the revolutionary masses of all revolutionary organizations in the mill urgently demanded that all revolutionary organizations unite and unify according to departments and systems. In the new stage of struggle, great unity according to departments and systems is the inevitable trend of revolutionary development.

To Unify the Organization, Thought Must First Be Unified

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9 achieved the victory of seizing power, due to the change in status, various non-proletarian thoughts within the revolutionary organization, such as mountainism, windism, sectarianism, splitism, and extreme democratism, began to surface. Some of the earliest revolutionary comrades who came out of the struggle had the thought of "only I am revolutionary"; some individuals in some larger revolutionary organizations had the tendency of "using size to pressure small"; some revolutionary workers, although they also knew the importance of unity and unity, thought of the glorious struggle history of their own organization and the comrades who fought side by side with them under the white terror, and had a certain resistance to breaking the existing cross-industry organizational boundaries to unite according to departments.

These erroneous thoughts stamped with the character "self" became ideological obstacles to achieving great unity according to departments. Without eliminating selfish thoughts, great unity would be just an empty talk. The proletarian revolutionary fighters, through practical struggles, realized the importance of solving ideological problems. They loudly proposed: To achieve great unity of the organization, we must first achieve great unity of thought. The 23 revolutionary organizations and more than 3,000 workers and cadres in the entire mill must have a unified thought to form a solid fighting collective. This thought is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, that is, the thought of "acting in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups." To break down selfishness and establish public spirit, to make more than 3,000 revolutionary fighters in the entire mill unite under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and fight shoulder to shoulder, the proletarian revolutionary faction decided to launch a rectification study three days after seizing power, to eliminate selfish thoughts from the depths of the soul and pave the way for achieving great unity according to departments.

The rectification movement first started among the responsible comrades of the 23 revolutionary organizations. They studied the "Three Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts," "Against Liberalism," and other brilliant works, as well as relevant editorials and articles from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily," and carried out criticism and self-criticism in accordance with the principle of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly break down the character "self." Then, the mill revolutionary committee, following the trend, launched a rectification movement throughout the mill and at the same time submitted the preliminary plan for achieving great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction in the entire mill according to departments and systems to the masses for discussion.

The "All-Invincible" combat corps, which took the lead in making revolution in this mill, always correctly implemented the party's policies and enjoyed relatively high prestige among the masses. This organization originally had only four people, but later developed to more than 2,000. In this rectification study, they especially emphasized the need to fiercely fight against the character "self," educating everyone that "revolution does not distinguish between early and late, and organizations do not distinguish between large and small, and we must not look down on other smaller revolutionary organizations." Through the rectification, the style of the "All-Invincible" combat corps changed greatly. They patiently listened to the opinions of other revolutionary organizations, especially being able to patiently listen to opposing opinions, rather than acting arbitrarily with one organization. When small organizations encountered difficulties, the "All-Invincible" combat corps would extend a friendly hand to help solve them. For disputes and differences between organizations, they also, in the spirit of being strict with themselves, seriously carried out self-criticism. These actions made other revolutionary organizations sincerely convinced. Other revolutionary organizations, through studying Chairman Mao's works, also actively criticized the erroneous tendencies of individualism, cliquism, and splitism within themselves.

Because the "All-Invincible" combat corps was large, it was inevitable that some shortcomings appeared in the fierce class struggle. In the rectification study, other revolutionary organizations first affirmed that the general direction of the "All-Invincible" combat corps was correct and at the same time frankly criticized its shortcomings, thus timely eliminating misunderstandings and estrangement between organizations. Large organizations did not use their size to pressure small ones, and small organizations did not use their small size to be arrogant. The ideological foundation for great unity in all systems, workshops, and teams in the entire mill was quickly formed.

On February 11, the "All-Invincible" combat corps, "Thunder" combat corps, "Lion" combat corps, and more than 20 other revolutionary organizations responded to the call of the mill revolutionary committee, handed over the seals of their own corps, and formally announced: The proletarian revolutionary faction of the entire mill has united to form a revolutionary committee. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the revolutionary faction of each workshop united to form a unified branch, and each team also established a unified revolutionary organization accordingly. Those who held the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest and performed the most resolutely and bravely in the struggle were appointed as the service personnel of the general assembly and branches. The 23 revolutionary organizations in the entire mill finally achieved great unity according to systems and departments under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

To Expand the "Three-in-One Combination" and Consolidate Great Unity

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9 achieved great unity according to departments and systems, it created better conditions for correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, uniting revolutionary cadres, and further powerfully promoted the formation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading core at all levels in the mill.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of the entire mill established a unified organization, they immediately put the issue of further correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and better uniting revolutionary cadres on the agenda. The mill revolutionary committee seriously organized all the workers in the mill to study the discussion on cadre issues in the third issue of the "Red Flag" magazine, unified thoughts, and corrected attitudes. On February 13, the entire mill held a heart-to-heart talk meeting for cadres at all levels. At the meeting, the proletarian revolutionary faction unanimously agreed to absorb two leading cadres who performed relatively well in the struggle into the revolutionary organization and participate in the leadership of revolution and production. Since the proletarian revolutionary faction of the entire mill established a unified organization, through a series of painstaking and meticulous ideological work, four leading cadres and two engineers have participated in the "three-in-one combination" leading cadre. Various departments and workshops also, according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, correctly analyzed the cadres of their own units and formed revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cores one after another.

With the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction according to departments, the anarchist tendencies in factories, workshops, and teams were quickly overcome. The unified revolutionary organization is uniting the majority of the workers and cadres in the entire mill. A vast, organized, and disciplined proletarian revolutionary army is forming.

In the past, the 23 "command centers" in the entire mill each had their own set of rules, and the notices and resolutions of the mill revolutionary committee were issued slowly and executed poorly; now, from the mill level to the team level, notices and instructions can be transmitted to the team within half an hour.

With the change in organizational form, the spiritual face of the revolutionary masses has also been renewed. In the past few months, liberalism that had grown in some organizations is being overcome, and in its place is the proletarian style of decisive action and collective thinking that considers the overall situation. The entire mill, with unified thoughts, unified organization, unified deployment, and unified action, has further consolidated the unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and the power is held more firmly.

In the past, a workshop with five or six revolutionary organizations had overlapping meetings, almost every day there were absentees, seriously affecting production; now, the workshop and team revolution and production are arranged in a coordinated manner, ensuring the normal progress of production.

In the past, more than 160 people were full-time in charge of the work of revolutionary organizations, almost every organization occupied an office, a telephone, and a "small warehouse"; now, after the organization is unified, more than 130 people have returned to their original production positions, more than 20 telephones and other equipment have been transferred to the production front line. Except for establishing a revolutionary production committee composed of five people at the mill level, the mill revolutionary committee only sets up four small groups to handle all work, and only 36 full-time revolutionary workers in the entire mill, accounting for only 0.95% of the total number of workers in the mill.

After the establishment of unified revolutionary organizations in various workshops and departments of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9, the revolution and production have been greatly promoted. A well-organized and disciplined proletarian revolutionary army, responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," is making the revolution booming and vibrant, and making production bustling with activity. The entire mill presents a prosperous and thriving new situation.

    思想大统一　组织大联合
    各革命组织按部门、按系统联合起来，对走资本主义道路当权派的斗争火力集中，生产步调一致，革命和生产面貌焕然一新
    新华社济南十日电 青岛市国棉九厂无产阶级革命派在取得夺权胜利以后，通过整风运动破私立公，统一思想，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，全厂革命组织从厂级、车间到生产班组都按部门、按系统层层归口，实现了真正的无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    这个厂原来有二十三个跨部门、跨车间的革命造反兵团，二月十一日已经联合组成一个统一的革命组织。这个在革命的“三结合”领导核心统一领导下的革命组织，目前正在团结全厂群众和干部的大多数，形成一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军。这支革命大军在同厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，火力集中，所向披靡，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，有声有色；同时，由于指挥灵便，步调一致，生产战线上也热气腾腾，捷报频传。二月份，这个厂的棉纱、棉布、印染等主要产品的产量和质量指标，全部超额完成了国家计划。
    最近，青岛市革命委员会总结和推广了这个厂层层归口统一组织的好经验，号召全市工矿企业向他们学习，逐步实现按部门按系统的大联合。
              革命发展的必然趋势
    一月十九日，国棉九厂无产阶级革命派实现了初步的大联合，一举从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回了一切大权。夺权胜利后，革命队伍不断扩大，最后全厂发展成为二十三个革命组织共掌大权的局面。
    夺权胜利以前，这个厂的革命组织和革命群众，冲破一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所实行的白色恐怖，冲破资产阶级反动路线所设置的重重障碍，打破部门和系统的界限闹革命，立下了不朽的功勋。夺权胜利后，当二十三个革命组织共同掌权的时候，就暴露出了许多矛盾。譬如，在领导权的问题上，每个组织都想多向厂革命委员会派一个代表；每个车间都有几个以至十几个革命组织，每次开会，那一个组织都想取得掌握会议的权利，常常为此而发生争执；有些组织从小集团的利益出发，互相争夺发展对象，组织之间常常为此闹得很不团结；二十三个组织自成系统，各自为政，许多问题经常达不成协议。这样下去，在夺权斗争中形成的初步大联合，就随时都有破裂的危险。
    跨部门、跨车间实行联合的分散的组织形式，在无产阶级革命派联合掌权以后，还十分不利于贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，不利于本单位进行斗、批、改。这个厂的许多车间在进一步批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，因为各个革命组织都要出面，有时就只好由各个组织轮流进行批判，结果火力分散，声势不大，收效甚微。有些车间甚至因为两派意见统一不起来，而使斗批改延缓下来。在生产方面，因为一个车间和班组的工人往往分散在几个革命组织中，许多问题很不好解决。印染车间北染缸小组十三名工人，分属五个战斗兵团，班组会都开不起来。在实现按部门、按系统的大联合以前，由于组织多，头绪乱，厂革命委员会的指示和决议不能及时贯彻执行。造成指挥不灵，调度不便，步调不一，影响了革命和生产的顺利进行。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”文化大革命运动初期，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派实行的白色恐怖中“杀”出来的革命派战士，带着夺权胜利后存在的问题，反复学习毛主席关于革命队伍团结和统一的教导，逐渐认识到跨部门联合的危害性，他们深有体会地说：“‘私’字是分裂主义和小团体主义的老根；分散的组织形式，是产生分裂主义和小团体主义的土壤。要想彻底纠正分裂主义和小团体主义等错误倾向，不仅要刨掉‘私’字的老根，还要铲除生长它的土壤”。因此，全厂各个革命组织的革命群众，迫切要求各革命组织按部门、按系统联合和统一起来。在新的斗争阶段，按部门、按系统的大联合是革命发展的必然趋势。
             要想统一组织，必先统一思想
    国棉九厂的无产阶级革命派夺权胜利后，由于地位的改变，革命组织内部的各种非无产阶级思想，如山头主义、风头主义、宗派主义、分裂主义和极端民主化等错误思想倾向，开始暴露出来。最早“杀”出来的革命派中的个别同志，躺在前一阶段运动中所取得的成绩上，产生了“唯我革命”的思想；有些比较大的革命组织中的个别同志，产生了“以大压小”的思想苗头。有些革命派工人虽然也知道团结和统一的重要性，但是一想到自己组织的光荣斗争史，想到在白色恐怖下同自己并肩战斗的战友，便对原来的组织很留恋，对于打破现有的跨行业的组织界限来按部门搞联合，有一定的抵触情绪。
    这种种打着“私”字烙印的错误思想，成为按部门实现大联合的思想障碍。不去掉私心杂念，大联合只不过是一句空话。无产阶级革命派战士们，在斗争实践中体会到了解决思想问题的重要性。他们响亮地提出：要想实现组织的大联合，必须首先实现思想的大统一。全厂二十三个革命组织，三千多名工人和干部，要想团结成一个巩固的战斗集体，必须有一个统一的思想。这个思想就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就是“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”的思想。为了破私立公，使全厂三千多名革命战士统一在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下并肩战斗，无产阶级革命派夺权后第三天，就决定开展整风学习，铲除灵魂深处的私心杂念，为实现按部门的大联合铺平道路。
    整风运动首先在二十三个革命组织的负责人中开展起来了。他们针对在按部门大联合问题上存在的思想问题，学习了“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论和文章，并且本着既弄清思想，又团结同志的原则，开展批评和自我批评，用毛泽东思想做武器，大破“私”字。接着，厂革命委员会又因势利导，在全厂展开整风运动，同时把按部门、按系统实现全厂无产阶级革命派大联合的初步方案交给群众讨论。
    这个厂带头闹革命的“全无敌”战斗兵团，在斗争的关键时刻始终正确地执行党的方针政策，在群众中享有较高的威信。这个组织开始只有四个人，后来发展到了两千多人。在这次整风学习中，他们特别强调要狠斗“私”字，教育大家“革命不分先后，组织不分大小，决不能看不起其他较小的革命组织”。通过整风，“全无敌”战斗兵团的作风有了很大的转变，遇到什么问题都耐心地听取其他革命组织的意见，特别是能够耐心听取反对自己的意见，而不是自己一个组织独断专行。有些小组织遇到什么困难，“全无敌”战斗兵团就伸出友谊的手，帮助解决。对组织之间发生的争执和分歧，他们也本着对自己从严要求的精神，认真进行自我批评。这些，都使其他革命组织心悦诚服。其他革命组织通过学习毛主席著作，也都主动批判了自身存在的个人主义、小团体主义和分裂主义的错误倾向。
    由于“全无敌”战斗兵团组织庞大，在激烈的阶级斗争中，难免出现这样或那样的缺点。在整风学习中，其他革命组织首先肯定了“全无敌”战斗兵团的大方向是正确的，同时也对它的缺点坦率地进行了批评，这样就及时消除了各组织之间的误会和隔阂。大组织不以大压小，小组织不以小傲大。全厂各个系统、各个车间、各个班组实行大联合的思想基础，就迅速地形成了。
    二月十一日，“全无敌”战斗兵团、“惊雷”战斗兵团、“雄狮”战斗兵团等二十多个革命组织响应厂革命委员会的号召，交出了本兵团的大印，并且正式宣布：全厂无产阶级革命派统一组成革命委员会。在革命委员会的领导下，每个车间的革命派都联合组成了统一的分会，每个班组，也都相应地建立了统一的革命组织。毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，斗争中表现得最坚决、最勇敢的人，担任总会和分会的服务员。全厂二十三个革命组织，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，终于实现了按系统、按部门的大联合。
            扩大“三结合”，巩固大联合
    国棉九厂革命派按部门、按系统实现大联合以后，为正确贯彻毛主席的干部政策，团结革命干部，创造了更好的条件，进一步有力地促进了全厂各级临时权力机构“三结合”领导核心的形成。
    全厂无产阶级革命派建立起统一的组织之后，他们马上就把进一步正确地贯彻毛主席的干部政策，更好地团结革命干部的问题，提到了议事日程上来。厂革命委员会认真地组织全厂职工学习了《红旗》杂志第三期社论中关于干部问题的论述，统一了思想，端正了态度。二月十三日，全厂召开了一次各级干部谈心会。会上，无产阶级革命派一致同意吸收在斗争中表现较好的两个领导干部加入革命组织，并参加革命和生产的领导工作。全厂无产阶级革命派建立统一组织以来，通过一系列艰苦细致的思想工作，又有四名领导干部和两名工程师，参加“三结合”的领导班子。各部门，各车间，也都根据毛主席的干部政策，正确分析本单位的干部，相继形成了革命的“三结合”的领导核心。
    随着无产阶级革命派按部门的大联合，迅速克服了工厂、车间和班组的无政府主义倾向。统一的革命组织正在团结全厂群众和干部的大多数。一支浩浩荡荡的、有组织纪律的无产阶级革命大军正在形成。
    过去，全厂二十三个“司令部”，每个兵团各搞一套，厂革命委员会的通知和决议下达迟缓，执行不力；现在，从厂级到班组层层归口，通知和指示在半小时之内即可传达到班组。
    随着组织形式的改变，革命群众的精神面貌也焕然一新。几个月来，在一部分组织中滋长起来的自由主义正在克服，代之而来的是无产阶级的雷厉风行的战斗作风，和胸怀全局的集体主义思想。全厂上下，思想统一，组织统一，部署统一，行动统一，无产阶级革命派的团结进一步巩固，政权掌得更牢靠了。
    过去，一个车间五六个革命组织，会议参差重叠，几乎每天都有缺勤现象，严重影响生产；现在，车间班组革命和生产统筹安排，保证了生产正常进行。
    过去，有一百六十余人脱产主持革命组织的工作，差不多每个组织都占用一个办公室，一部电话机，一个“小仓库”；现在，组织统一后，有一百三十多人回到原生产岗位，二十余部电话机和其他装备，都充实到了生产第一线。全厂除在厂级设立一个由五人组成的革命生产委员会以外，厂革命委员会只下设四个小组，担负全盘工作，全厂脱产搞革命的职工只有三十六人，仅占全厂职工人数的百分之零点九五。
    国棉九厂各车间、各部门的统一的革命组织建立后，有力地推动了革命和生产的发展。一支有组织有纪律的无产阶级革命大军，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾。全厂上下，呈现出一派蓬勃兴旺的新气象。
