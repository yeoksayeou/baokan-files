The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism to oppose China, has employed every conceivable vile and shameless method of slander and defamation. Recently, the Soviet revisionist press has even gone so far as to claim that the counterrevolutionary coup and bloody white terror perpetrated by the rightist military clique in Indonesia, with the backing of U.S. imperialism, was "instigated" by China. Meanwhile, the Soviet revisionists feign concern for the fate of the Indonesian people, pretending to be "sympathetic." We must expose this shameless lie and hypocritical tactic!

Everyone knows that since October 1965, the rightist military clique headed by Suharto and Nasution, with the plotting of U.S. imperialism, has gradually usurped state power in Indonesia, establishing a naked fascist dictatorship. White terror has engulfed this archipelago nation, and tens of thousands of Indonesian Communists and revolutionary people have been massacred. Even now, tens of thousands of Indonesian progressives are still imprisoned, continuing to suffer cruel persecution. The Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world express great indignation and strong protest against the heinous crimes committed by the Indonesian rightists! The Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world stand firmly on the side of the Indonesian people!

What role did the Soviet revisionist renegade clique play and what dirty deeds did they do in the bloody event of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys suppressing the Indonesian revolution and massacring the Indonesian people?

After the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique came to power, the Soviet revisionist leadership not only did not condemn the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries, but instead praised Nasution, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people, as a "national leader opposing imperialism"; not only did they not condemn the pro-American, sellout policies of the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship, but they praised it as "anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist." You Soviet revisionist renegades are trying so hard to whitewash the Indonesian rightist fascist clique, doesn't this prove that you are in cahoots with the Indonesian reactionaries?

The Soviet revisionist leadership has been very close with the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship. When the rightist forces in Indonesia went crazy with anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and brutally persecuted overseas Chinese last October, the foreign minister of the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship, Malik, was invited to visit the Soviet Union and held talks with Soviet leaders Kosygin and Gromyko. Afterwards, Malik boasted: "The Soviet Union and Indonesia have reached an understanding on the basis of anti-imperialism and have strengthened the relations between the two countries." In January of this year, the Soviet revisionists even sent a "Soviet Workers' Delegation" to visit Indonesia and openly merged with the yellow unions there. This fully exposed the traitorous and scab nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

When the Indonesian reactionaries faced a serious financial and economic crisis, the Soviet revisionists quickly came to the rescue to provide "aid" to the Indonesian reactionaries. In November last year, the Soviet Union and Indonesia signed an agreement on debts, aid, and trade, stipulating that Indonesia would defer the repayment of twelve billion dollars in loans (eight billion dollars of which are military expenses) for a period of thirteen years. Isn't the Soviet revisionist leadership intentionally supporting and maintaining the Indonesian fascist reactionary regime?

Even more seriously, the Soviet revisionists have been tightening their military collusion with the Indonesian reactionaries. The Soviet revisionists continue to supply weapons and equipment to the Indonesian reactionaries. In February last year, Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky received the Indonesian Air Force Deputy Commander Nuruddin and held a "harmonious meeting." The rightist leader Nasution also wrote to Malinovsky expressing his "hope for close cooperation between the two countries, especially close cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries." In February of this year, the Soviet military attaché in Jakarta held a meeting with representatives of the Indonesian rightist army. Isn't this military "cooperation" between the Soviet revisionists and the Indonesian reactionaries helping the Indonesian reactionaries to massacre Indonesian Communists and the revolutionary people of Indonesia?

The Soviet revisionist leadership is so close to the Indonesian reactionaries, while their attitude towards the Indonesian Communists and the revolutionary people of Indonesia is completely different. Just before the Indonesian fascist regime's foreign minister Malik visited the Soviet Union, the Soviet leadership, in order to curry favor with the Indonesian reactionaries, arbitrarily expelled Anwar Darma, the former Moscow correspondent of the Indonesian Communist Party's newspaper. Recently, the Soviet revisionists also arbitrarily expelled Suar Suroso, an Indonesian Communist Party member, a member of the National Committee of the Indonesian People's Youth League, and an Indonesian student in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionists, from a counterrevolutionary standpoint, have very clear likes and dislikes. They love the Indonesian rightists and fascists, and hate the heroic and unyielding Indonesian Communists and the Indonesian people.

Ink-written lies cannot cover up blood-written facts. The eyes of the people of the world are sharp. They see clearly who is revolutionary and who is not, who is counterrevolutionary.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counterrevolutionary." The Soviet revisionist leadership stands firmly on the side of the Indonesian reactionaries who massacre the Indonesian people; they are unquestionably counterrevolutionaries and a shameful accomplice of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in suppressing the Indonesian people's revolution.

Birds of a feather flock together. It is no surprise that the Soviet revisionist leadership colludes with the Indonesian rightist reactionary forces. You Soviet revisionist renegades have formed a counterrevolutionary "holy alliance" with U.S. imperialism. You not only collude with U.S. imperialism but also with all of U.S. imperialism's lackeys and puppets. You help U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries suppress the Indonesian people's revolution, and yet you have the audacity to claim that you "sympathize" with the Indonesian people and are "concerned" about their fate. You'd better save your crocodile tears for another time!

    鳄鱼的眼泪
    苏修叛徒集团为了联合美帝国主义进行反华，用尽了一切最卑鄙、最无耻的造谣和诽谤手段。最近，苏修报刊居然把美帝国主义及其走卒在印尼制造的右派将领集团的反革命政变和血腥的白色恐怖，说成是中国“挑起的”，而苏修自己却是对印尼人民的命运如何“感到忧虑”，好象是非常“同情”的样子。对于苏修叛徒集团这个无耻的谎言和伪善的手法，我们必须加以揭穿！
    大家知道，自从一九六五年十月以来，以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派将领集团在美帝国主义的策划下，逐步篡夺了印尼国家政权，建立了赤裸裸的法西斯专政。白色恐怖笼罩了这个千岛之国，几十万印尼共产党人和革命人民惨遭屠杀。直到现在，仍有几十万印尼进步人士被囚禁在监狱里，继续遭到残酷的迫害。中国人民和全世界的革命人民对于印尼右派所犯下的滔天罪行，表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议！中国人民和全世界革命人民坚决站在印尼人民这一边！
    苏修叛徒集团在美帝国主义及其走卒镇压印尼革命、屠杀印尼人民的血腥事件中，究竟扮演了什么角色，干了什么样的勾当呢？
    当苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团上台后，苏修领导集团不但不谴责印尼反动派的法西斯暴行，相反，却吹捧双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的刽子手纳苏蒂安是什么“反帝的民族领袖”；不但不谴责印尼法西斯军事独裁政权的亲美卖国政策，反而颂扬它是“反帝反殖”的。你们这一伙苏修叛徒竭力为印尼右派法西斯集团涂脂抹粉，难道不证明你们同印尼反动派是心心相印的吗？
    苏修领导集团同印尼法西斯军事独裁政权打得火热。当去年十月印尼右派势力疯狂反华排华、残酷迫害华侨的时候，印尼法西斯军事独裁政权的外交部长马利克应邀到苏联去访问，同苏修头目柯西金和葛罗米柯分别进行会谈。事后，马利克非常得意地说：“苏联和印度尼西亚在反帝的基础上取得谅解、密切了两国关系。”今年一月间，苏修还派了一个“苏联工人代表团”访问印尼，同印尼黄色工会公开合流。这充分暴露了苏修领导集团的工贼和叛徒的嘴脸。
    当印尼反动派面临严重的财政经济危机的时候，苏修就赶紧出来为印尼反动派提供经济上的“援助”。去年十一月，苏联和印尼签订了关于债务、援助和贸易议定书，规定印尼延期偿还十二亿美元的贷款（其中八亿美元是军费），时间长达十三年。苏修领导集团不是有意扶植印尼反动派，全力支持和维护印尼法西斯反动政权吗？
    更加严重的是，苏修竟然同印尼反动派加紧军事上的勾结。苏修继续为印尼反动派运送武器和装备。去年二月，苏修的国防部长马利诺夫斯基接见了印尼空军副司令努尔亚丁，并进行了“融洽的会晤”。右派头目纳苏蒂安也写信给马利诺夫斯基表示“希望两国进行密切合作，特别是两国武装部队进行密切合作”。今年二月间，苏联驻雅加达大使馆武官同印尼右派军队代表进行了会晤。苏修同印尼反动派之间的这种军事上的“合作”，难道不是帮助印尼反动派去屠杀印尼共产党人和印尼的革命人民吗？
    苏修领导集团同印尼反动派是这样的亲，而对印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民却完全是另一种态度。就在印尼法西斯政权的外交部长马利克访苏前夕，苏修领导为了讨好印尼反动派，竟然蛮横无理地把印尼共产党党报前驻莫斯科记者安瓦尔·达尔马驱逐出境。不久前，苏修又把印尼共产党员、印尼人民青年团全国委员会委员、印尼留苏学生苏阿尔·苏罗梭蛮横无理地驱逐出境。苏修从反革命立场出发，他们的爱憎是很分明的。他们爱的是印尼右派和法西斯，恨的是英勇不屈的印尼共产党人和印尼人民。
    墨写的谎言，掩盖不了血写的事实。全世界人民的眼睛是雪亮的。谁个革命，谁个不革命，谁个反革命，他们看得一清二楚。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”苏修领导集团是完全站在屠杀印尼人民的印尼反动派一边的，是不折不扣的反革命派，是美帝国主义及其走卒镇压印尼人民革命的一个可耻的帮凶。
    物以类聚，人以群分。苏修领导集团同印尼右派反动势力相勾结，这是不足为奇的。你们这一伙苏修叛徒，同美帝国主义结成了反革命的“神圣同盟”。你们不仅同美帝国主义勾结，而且也同美帝国主义的一切走狗和傀儡相勾结。你们为虎作伥，帮助美帝国主义和印尼反动派镇压印尼人民的革命，居然还有脸皮把自己说成是“同情”印尼人民，为印尼人民的命运“感到忧虑”。你们这几滴鳄鱼的眼泪，还是趁早地收起来吧！
