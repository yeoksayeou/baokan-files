In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have experienced the "stormy winds of mass struggle" and witnessed the "great scene of mass struggle," and have also been tempered and remolded.

For many years, I have made many mistakes in my work. In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, causing great harm to the Party's cause. Initially, I did not understand this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Comrade Pan Fusheng, the First Secretary of the CPC Black Dragon River Provincial Committee, promptly conveyed to us the important instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, with the patient help of the Red Rebels, I gradually changed my stance and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I clearly realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has extremely profound significance. Without such a massive, mass-based revolutionary movement and without practicing such extensive democracy, it would be impossible to root out the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Otherwise, the dangerous situation pointed out by Chairman Mao would arise: "Without much time, in a few years or a dozen years, or in a few decades, a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration would inevitably occur. The Marxist-Leninist party would definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China would change color."

Politics in command, willingly accepting the scrutiny and criticism of the revolutionary masses

For cadres like me who have made many mistakes in their work, it is very necessary to accept the scrutiny and criticism of the revolutionary masses in this cultural revolution. Without the scrutiny and criticism of the masses and without the flames of the mass movement burning away one's mistakes, it would be very dangerous to continue.

Because I have a preliminary understanding and comprehension of the great significance of this great revolutionary movement personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, in late August last year, when the revolutionary masses of the Food Company under the Black Dragon River Provincial Commercial Bureau posted big-character posters exposing my numerous mistakes and held a struggle meeting against me at the office building gate, I did not harbor any resistance. Why? Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." I believe in Chairman Mao, I believe in the Party Central Committee, and I firmly believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is absolutely correct, with the great significance of preventing revisionism and ensuring that our socialist state will never change color. I believe in the masses. I have indeed made many mistakes, and it is right for the masses to criticize and struggle against my mistakes; there should be no complaints. At this time, I also recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Because we are serving the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not be afraid of others pointing them out and criticizing us." "Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, still have mistakes that we cannot abandon?" Chairman Mao's teachings gave me endless strength. I seriously examined my mistakes and sincerely accepted the criticism and struggle of the revolutionary masses.

However, after the struggle meeting against me, I still had some struggles in my mind. The main concern was how the surrounding masses and the people in my family would view me. It was possible that someone would regard me as an anti-Party, anti-socialist element. How should these problems be solved? I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, that one should have a correct understanding and estimation of oneself, dare to stand out, and dare to explain the real situation to the masses and propagate and explain the Party's policies. Therefore, I actively approached the masses, explained my real situation to them, and sought the trust of the masses. I did the same at home.

Supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses requires a firm stance and clear banner

After having a certain degree of understanding and recognition of this great mass movement, I gradually sided with the Red Rebels. I also lived and fought together with the revolutionary youngsters for a period. Practice made me clearly see that the Red Rebels, in the movement, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented the Sixteen Points, firmly grasped the grand direction of the struggle, and carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to venture, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel. They fought resolutely against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, establishing immortal merits. Especially, Chairman Mao's teachings: "You should put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." gave me great education. I resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions. The Red Rebels and the revolutionary masses, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, actively helped and educated me, creating conditions for me to "come out," urging me to revolutionize and rebel.

To make a revolution, to rebel, one must act accordingly. In the struggle between the two lines, as a revolutionary cadre, should one "not intervene"? Or should one play it safe, compromise? Or should one firmly support the revolutionary faction? Thus, I again consulted Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The thousands of principles of Marxism, in the end, boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" Chairman Mao's teachings made me clearly see that the Red Rebels always held high the revolutionary banner of "Rebellion is justified," and fought resolutely against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party; whatever Chairman Mao said, they did, and the grand direction was always correct. Therefore, whether in living and fighting together with the youngsters or in my own department, I resolutely stood on the side of the Red Rebels, learned from them, and fought together with them. When the struggle between the Red Rebel Corps representing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the "August 7th Red Rebel Corps" representing conservative forces within the Black Dragon River Provincial Commercial Bureau was intense, I firmly stood on the side of the Red Rebel Corps, fought together, and publicly participated in the debate, clearly pointing out that the "August 7th Red Rebel Corps" directed their spears at the masses, and their grand direction was wrong. The conservative forces, in a rage, appeared in an ultra-leftist guise, ruthlessly besieged and struggled against me, trying to force me to admit that their grand direction was correct. At that time, I had a thought: by supporting one side and attacking the other, would it lead to the result of the masses fighting the masses? But then I thought, I am doing this precisely to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and must have a firm stance and clear banner. Therefore, no matter how the conservative forces besieged me, I always believed that the Red Rebel Corps were revolutionary, followed Chairman Mao, and represented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; and I always believed that the grand direction of the "August 7th Red Rebel Corps" was wrong, representing conservative forces. In the storm of red seizure of power, this so-called "August 7th Red Rebel Corps" finally disintegrated.

Practice made me deeply realize that in the great storms and waves of class struggle, only by firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, together with the Red Rebels, holding high the revolutionary banner, daring to rebel against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and daring to rebel against the "self" in one's own mind, can one truly change and temper oneself, making the "self" go out the door and the "public" settle down, and truly become a red revolutionary warrior who is forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, and to the people's revolutionary cause, becoming a good student of Chairman Mao!

Because of the change in stance, I gradually went from fearing revolution to daring to revolution and consciously making revolution. The Red Rebels and the revolutionary masses criticized me, not to overthrow me as a person, but to criticize my erroneous thoughts, helping me to clean out the political dust in my mind. Through criticism, I discarded my mistakes and non-proletarian thoughts and gained the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The masses' attitude towards my criticism was both serious and sincere, fully in accordance with Chairman Mao's principle of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient" and the formula of "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle to resolve contradictions, and thus achieving new unity on a new basis." After exposing and criticizing, they gave me a realistic evaluation. Their approach of "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades" more powerfully prompted me to touch my soul, thoroughly clean out the filth deep in my soul, and helped me establish Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary masses are reasonable; they observe, analyze, and handle problems tightly grasping and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." "The masses are the true heroes..." Practice repeatedly proved that Chairman Mao's teachings are absolutely true, making me go from fearing the masses to believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and strengthening and firming up my resolve and courage to correct mistakes and learn from the Red Rebels, fighting together with them. Therefore, I changed from passively waiting for the masses to expose and criticize me to consciously and actively accepting the masses' exposure and criticism. When the revolutionary mass organizations wanted to hold a meeting to expose and criticize me, I actively requested that all revolutionary masses of the provincial and municipal commercial system enthusiastically participate in the meeting to expose and criticize me. In this way, the more people there were, the more thorough the exposure, the deeper the criticism, and the greater the help.

Together with the revolutionary masses, firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." In the storm of "three-in-one" combined seizure of power, the Red Rebels of the provincial and municipal commercial system seized back the power of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the original Black Dragon River Provincial Commercial Bureau. This is a revolutionary action, and I firmly support it. The Black Dragon River Provincial Provisional Supreme Power Organ—the Revolutionary Committee—was born. I participated in the work of the Revolutionary Committee. This is the trust of the Party and the masses in me. I am determined to consolidate the power we have already seized, together with the Red Rebels, raise our vigilance, and prevent the counter-revolutionaries from seizing power back. I resolutely and seriously implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp the revolution and promote production." Under the help and supervision of the Red Rebels, I actively and positively do my work, firmly grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, and make new contributions to thoroughly seizing, holding, and using power well!

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We should regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we should constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." Therefore, correctly treating the revolutionary mass movement, correctly treating one's own mistakes, revolutionizing oneself, and giving full play to the role of the revolutionary masses are very important issues. The revolutionary masses bravely expose and criticize the mistakes of cadres, precisely to help us cadres wash away the filth that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, making us forever young in revolution and better revolutionize to the end. This revolutionary mass movement is a rare tempering for revolutionaries; it will make us braver and stronger. If one cannot correctly treat the masses and cannot face one's own mistakes, one will become depressed because the masses have criticized one in this way or that, or even complain about the masses or wait for the masses to "invite" one, all of which are wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us... If one makes mistakes, one should correct them, and the quicker and more thoroughly one corrects them, the better." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, discard all selfish motives, put down our burdens, put down our official airs, fear no shame, fear no pain, thoroughly expose ourselves, rise up in revolution, make amends for past mistakes; willingly be a student of the masses, be loyal and honest, diligent and hardworking, work for the Party, unite with the Red Rebels, fight with them, and achieve victory with them.

    甘当无产阶级革命派的小学生
    原黑龙江省商业厅厅长　燕文卿
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我经了“群众斗争的大风雨”，见了“群众斗争的大世面”，也受到了锻炼和改造。
    多年来，我在工作中犯了许多错误，在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，又执行了资产阶级反动路线，给党的事业造成很大的损失。开始，我对这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命很不理解。党的八届十一中全会以后，中共黑龙江省委第一书记潘复生同志及时地给我们传达了毛主席和党中央的重要指示。在毛泽东思想的教导下，在红色造反者的耐心帮助下，我逐渐转变了立场，回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。我清楚地认识到，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命具有极其深远的意义。如果没有这样一场规模巨大的群众性的革命运动，不实行这样广泛的大民主，就不可能揪出隐藏在党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，那就会出现毛主席所指出的那样危险的情景：“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    政治挂帅，自觉接受革命群众的审查批判
    对于象我这样在工作中犯有许多错误的干部来说，在这场文化大革命中，接受革命群众的审查和批判，是十分必要的。如果没有群众的审查和批判，没有群众运动的烈火把身上的错误烧掉，发展下去，是十分危险的。
    由于我对毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场伟大的革命运动的伟大意义有了初步的理解和领会，所以，在去年八月底，当黑龙江省商业厅所属食品公司的革命群众给我贴大字报，揭发了我的大量错误，并在办公大楼门前召开斗争我的大会时，我没有产生任何抵触情绪。为什么呢？毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”我相信毛主席，相信党中央，坚信毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命是无比正确的，有着防修反修使我国社会主义江山永不变色的伟大意义。我相信群众。自己的确犯了很多错误，群众对自己的错误进行批判斗争是应该的，不应该有任何埋怨情绪。这时，我又想起了毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”毛主席的教导给了我无穷的力量，我认真地检查自己的错误，并诚心诚意地接受革命群众对我的批判和斗争。
    但是，在开过我的斗争大会以后，我思想上还是有斗争的。主要是顾虑周围的群众和家庭里的人要怎样看待我，很可能有人会把我当做反党反社会主义分子。应当怎样解决这些问题呢？我想到毛主席的教导，对自己要有正确的认识和估计，要敢于挺身而出，敢于向群众说明真实情况，向群众宣传解释党的方针政策。于是，我就主动接近群众，向群众说明自己的真实情况，争取群众的信任，在家里也是如此。
    支持无产阶级革命派要立场坚定旗帜鲜明
    从我对这场伟大的群众运动有了一定程度的理解和认识之后，便逐步地倒向红色造反者一边。并且同革命小将共同生活，共同战斗了一个时期。实践使我清楚地看到红色造反者在运动中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行十六条，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，发扬敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的大无畏精神，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行坚决斗争，立下了不朽的功勋。特别是毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”给了我极大教育，我坚决执行了毛主席这个指示。红色造反者和革命群众，也根据毛主席的教导，主动帮助和教育我，给我创造了“亮相”的条件，敦促我起来革命，起来造反。革命小将无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的鲜明的阶级感情，坚持活学活用毛主席著作的革命热情和大无畏的革命精神，深深地教育了我，在政治上给了我巨大的鼓舞和力量，终于促使我起来革命了，起来造反了！
    要革命，要造反，就要见之于行动。在两条路线的斗争中，作为革命的领导干部，是“不介入”呢，还是和稀泥、搞折中呢？还是旗帜鲜明地支持革命派呢？于是我又向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”毛主席的教导，使我清楚地看到红色造反者始终是高举“造反有理”的革命大旗，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反；毛主席怎样说的，他们就怎样做，大方向始终是正确的。因此，无论是在和小将一起生活和一起战斗的日子里，还是在本部门，我都毅然决然地站在红色造反者一边，向他们学习，同他们一起战斗。黑龙江省商业厅内代表毛主席革命路线的红色造反团和代表保守势力的“二七红色造反团”斗争激烈的时候，我坚决站在红色造反团一边，共同战斗，公开参加了辩论，明确指出“二七红色造反团”把矛头指向群众，大方向是错误的。保守势力恼羞成怒，为了达到攻击红色造反团的目的，以极“左”的面目出现，对我进行了无情的围攻和斗争，企图逼着我承认他们的大方向是正确的。当时，我脑子里有一种想法：这样支持一派，打击一派，是不是会引起群众斗群众的后果呢？但是又一想，我这样作正是为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，必须立场坚定，旗帜鲜明。所以，无论保守势力怎样围攻，我始终认定红色造反团是革命的，是紧跟毛主席的，是代表了毛主席的革命路线；也始终认定“二七红色造反团”的大方向是错误的，是代表保守势力的。在红色夺权风暴中，这个所谓的“二七红色造反团”终于瓦解了。
    实践使我深刻体会到，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，只有坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，同红色造反者一起，高举革命大旗，敢于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，敢于造自己头脑里“私”字的反，才能很好地改造自己，锻炼自己，使“私”字扫地出门，“公”字安家落户，才能真正成为永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于党和人民革命事业的红色革命战士，成为毛主席的好学生！
    由于立场的转变，我逐渐由害怕革命到敢于革命、自觉革命了。红色造反者和革命群众批判我，不是为了打倒我这个人，而是批判我的错误思想，帮助我清除头脑里的政治灰尘。经过批判，使我丢掉的是错误和非无产阶级思想，得到的则是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。群众对我批判的态度既是严肃认真，又满腔热忱，完全是按照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针和
  “从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结”的公式来做的，在揭发、批判之后，给我做了实事求是的评价。他们这种“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的做法，更加有力地促使我狠触灵魂，彻底清除灵魂深处的污泥浊水，帮助我树立了毛泽东思想。革命群众是通情达理的，他们是紧紧掌握和运用毛泽东思想来观察、分析、处理问题的。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄……。”实践一再证明了毛主席的教导是千真万确的真理，使我由害怕群众到相信群众、依靠群众，增强和坚定了改正错误和向红色造反者学习、一起战斗的决心和勇气。因此，由消极等待群众揭发、批判变为自觉地主动地去接受群众的揭发和批判，当革命群众组织要召开大会对我进行揭发、批判的时候，我主动要求省直商业系统全体革命群众踊跃参加揭发、批判我的大会。这样，人越多，揭发得越全，批判得越深，帮助越大。
    同革命群众在一起狠抓革命猛促生产
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”在“三结合”联合夺权的革命风暴中，省直商业系统红色造反者夺回原黑龙江省商业厅党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，这是革命的行动，我坚决拥护，坚决支持。黑龙江省临时最高权力机构——革命委员会诞生了。我参加了革命委员会的工作，这是党和群众对我的信任。我决心同红色造反者一起巩固好已经取得的权力，提高警惕，防止阶级敌人的反夺权。我坚决认真贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在红色造反者的帮助和监督下，积极主动地做好工作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为彻底夺好权、掌好权、用好权做出新的贡献！
    林彪副主席说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”因此，正确对待革命的群众运动，正确对待自己的错误，革好自己的命，同时发挥革命群众的作用，是十分重要的问题。革命群众起来勇敢地揭发、批判干部的错误，就是为了帮助我们干部洗涤那些不符合毛泽东思想的污泥浊水，使我们永葆革命青春，更好地革命到底。这种革命群众运动的烈火，对革命者来说，是一次难得的锻炼，它将使我们变得更加勇敢，更加坚强。如果不能正确对待群众，不能正视自己的错误，就会因为群众对自己作了这样或那样的批判而消沉下去，甚至埋怨群众或等待群众来“请”，都是不对的。毛主席教导我们：“错误和挫折教训了我们……犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我们必须遵照毛主席这一教导，丢掉一切私心杂念，放下包袱，放下官架子，不怕丑，不怕痛，彻底亮相，起来革命，将功补过；甘当群众的小学生，忠心耿耿，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，为党工作，同红色造反者团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
