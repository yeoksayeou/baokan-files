The revolutionary farmers' organizations in the suburbs of Zunyi, including the Zunyi Red Farmers' Combat Team, which advocates Mao Zedong Thought, and 1800 representatives from 15 other organizations, recently held a grand rally to pledge to seize the revolution and promote production to achieve a bumper harvest. The rally resolutely and enthusiastically responded to the great call of our red sun, Chairman Mao, to "seize the revolution and promote production." It thoroughly smashed the new counterattack launched by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to suppress the revolution and destroy production. The rally also adopted an emergency appeal to all revolutionary farmers in the province.

The appeal emphasized that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental guarantee for revolutionary victory. Revolutionary farmers must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently and seriously, and arm themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and spring production, it is especially important to study and apply the brilliant works such as the "Three Articles" and the "Sixteen Points," to wage a fierce struggle against selfishness and establish public spirit. They must wage a great revolution to transform both the objective world and their subjective world, transforming their souls.

The appeal also pointed out that revolutionary farmers in the countryside should, together with the revolutionary masses, jointly formulate spring production plans. During the planning process, they should be good at fostering the masses' pioneering spirit and at summarizing and applying effective advanced production experiences. They should vigorously promote the spirit of thrift in running the collective, building the country, striving for self-reliance, saving for the revolution, and producing with thrift, opposing economism. They must firmly guard their production posts, work diligently, and ensure full attendance. They should supervise the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside to undergo labor reform, allowing them to behave properly and not to cause trouble.

The appeal pointed out that county, district, and commune revolutionary cadres should resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive to "seize the revolution and promote production," while fighting against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, bravely shoulder their responsibilities and guard their posts to contribute to spring production. Cadres who have made mistakes must actively serve collective production and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to make amends for their errors.

    遵义市郊革命派农民组织致书全省农民
    活学活用毛主席著作搞好春耕生产
    本报讯　历史名城——遵义市郊毛泽东思想遵义红色农民战斗团等十五个革命派农民组织及一千八百多名代表，最近隆重地举行了抓革命促生产夺取农业大丰收的誓师大会。大会最坚决地、最热烈地响应我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席发出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，彻底粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑起的压革命、毁生产的新反扑，大会并通过了向全省革命农民发出的《紧急呼吁书》。
    呼吁书强调指出，活学活用毛主席著作，是革命胜利的根本保证。革命派农民，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加认真刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑。在当前无产阶级文化大革命和春耕生产中，特别要学好用好“老三篇”等光辉著作，学好用好“十六条”，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，既要进行改造客观世界的大革命，又要进行改造主观世界、改造自己灵魂的大革命。
    呼吁书还指出：农村中的革命派，应该与革命群众一起，共同商量，制定春耕生产计划。在订计划过程中，要善于发扬群众的首创精神，善于总结和运用行之有效的先进增产经验。应该大力发扬勤俭办社，勤俭建国，奋发图强，自力更生的精神，节约闹革命，勤俭搞生产，反对经济主义。一定要坚守生产岗位，多出勤，出满勤。要监督农村中的地、富、反、坏、右分子进行劳动改造。只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。
    呼吁书指出，县、区、社的革命干部，应坚决站在以毛主席为代表的革命路线一边，按照毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开展斗争的同时，勇敢地担负起自己的责任，坚守自己的岗位，为春耕生产贡献力量。那些犯有错误的干部，必须积极起来为集体生产服务，为广大贫下中农服务，将功补过。
