The Indian authorities have used Tibetan rebels to engage in brazen anti-China activities. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has lodged the strongest protest against the Indian government's new provocation.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a note to the Indian Embassy in China on March 20th, expressing the strongest protest against the Indian government's incitement of the Tibetan rebels it shelters and harbors to engage in brazen anti-China activities in front of the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi. The note also condemned the Indian government for instigating the traitor Dalai Lama to issue a statement, which maliciously attacked and slandered the Chinese government and people. The note pointed out that these two incidents were orchestrated by the Indian government, representing another gross interference in China's internal affairs and a deliberate provocation against the Chinese people.

The note stated: On the morning of March 10, 1967, a group of Tibetan rebels, numbering around four to five hundred, who were sheltered and harbored by the Indian government, engaged in brazen anti-China activities in front of the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi. They not only shouted extremely reactionary anti-China slogans and posted numerous anti-China posters on the embassy walls but also rushed to the embassy gate, climbed over the iron gate, and made a commotion, attempting to break into the embassy. They smashed the flowerpots in front of the embassy and threw the broken pieces and soil into the embassy compound, seriously threatening the embassy's security. On the previous day, March 9th, the traitor Dalai Lama, who is harbored by the Indian government, issued another statement, maliciously attacking and slandering the Chinese government and people, and once again attempting to incite the Tibetan people to rebel. Obviously, these two incidents were orchestrated by the Indian government, representing another gross interference in China's internal affairs and a deliberate provocation against the Chinese people. For this, the Chinese government lodges the strongest protest against the Indian government.

The note pointed out: The Indian government has done a lot of harm in Tibet. Without going into the distant past, after the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique launched the rebellion, the Indian government moved from behind the scenes to the forefront, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs. It has harbored members of the Dalai Lama's treasonous clique and a large number of rebels and has openly helped them establish a so-called exile government and publish a so-called Tibetan constitution in India. Even more outrageous, the Indian government has openly provided military training to these rebels. In recent years, the Indian government has repeatedly plotted to send the traitor Dalai Lama to Southeast Asian countries to engage in anti-China activities, attempting to disrupt the friendly relations between those countries and China. Regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, the Indian government, like all reactionary forces in the world, is terrified and hates it to the core. Besides operating its own propaganda machine to engage in anti-China rhetoric, it also incites the traitor Dalai Lama to spread rumors and slander. All of this is an ironclad fact known to all, which the Indian government cannot deny.

The note stated: It must be solemnly pointed out that the Indian government still maintains diplomatic relations with China. Under such circumstances, the Indian government has harbored tens of thousands of Chinese citizens who were coerced by rebels to go to India and has supported the Tibetan rebels in their subversive activities against the Chinese government for eight years. This is a rare phenomenon in the history of international diplomacy. People cannot help but ask, does the Indian government have any shred of international relations norms in mind?

The note stated: It must also be pointed out that while the Indian government is doing all these bad things, it claims that India has a kind of "sentimental and humanitarian sympathy" for Tibet; India "has the desire to maintain friendly relations with China" and "does not allow Tibetan refugees in India to engage in subversive political activities against the People's Republic of China," and so on. This is sheer hypocrisy. In fact, the Indian government's sympathies are not with the broad masses of the Tibetan people but with those Tibetan serf owners who are accustomed to eating hearts and gouging out eyes. What the Indian government is doing is not maintaining friendly relations with China but harboring and training the Tibetan rebels who are stranded in India, hoping one day to let them return to Tibet and restore the old Tibet of serfdom. In the end, the Indian government dreams of turning a new Tibet, which is becoming a socialist paradise, back into the old Tibet, a hell on earth. This is absolutely impossible.

The note finally pointed out: The Indian government initially inherited the legacy of British imperialism and is now actively aligning itself with American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. The Indian government's increasing arrogance in using the so-called Tibetan issue to engage in anti-China activities is not accidental. This is just a manifestation of the Indian government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. The Chinese government must warn the Indian government that if the Indian government does not change its anti-China policy and continues to interfere in China's internal affairs on the so-called Tibetan issue, it must bear the serious consequences that arise from this.

### 印度当局利用中国西藏叛匪进行猖狂反华活动  我外交部最强烈抗议印度政府新挑衅

    印度当局利用中国西藏叛匪进行猖狂反华活动
    我外交部最强烈抗议印度政府新挑衅
    新华社二十一日讯　中国外交部二十日照会印度驻华大使馆，最强烈地抗议印度政府煽动受它包庇和纵容的中国西藏叛匪，在新德里中国驻印度大使馆前进行猖狂的反华活动，并嗾使受它豢养的叛徒达赖发表所谓声明，对中国政府和人民进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑。照会指出，这两件事都是印度政府所一手策划的，是印度政府又一次粗暴干涉中国内政，蓄意向中国人民进行新的挑衅。
    照会说：一九六七年三月十日上午，一批受到印度政府包庇和纵容的中国西藏叛匪，约四、五百人，在新德里中国驻印度大使馆前进行猖狂的反华活动。他们不仅呼喊极端反动的反华口号，在大使馆的院墙上张贴大量反华标语，而且冲到大使馆门前，爬上铁门，大叫大闹，要冲进大使馆内。他们打碎了大使馆门前陈列的花盆，并将花盆的碎片、土块等物纷纷扔向大使馆院内，严重威胁了大使馆的安全。在此前一日，即三月九日，受印度政府豢养的叛徒达赖，又一次发表所谓声明，对中国政府和人民进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑，并且再次妄图煽动中国藏族人民进行叛乱活动。显然，这两件事都是印度政府所一手策划的，是印度政府又一次粗暴干涉中国内政，蓄意向中国人民进行新的挑衅。为此，中国政府向印度政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会指出：印度政府对中国西藏干了大量坏事。远的且不说，单是在西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱以后，印度政府就由幕后策划而走上前台，露骨地干涉中国内政。它收容了达赖叛国集团分子和大批叛匪，并且公然帮助他们在印度成立所谓流亡政府，公布所谓西藏宪法。更有甚者，印度政府公然给这些叛匪以武装训练。近几年来，印度政府多次筹划，要叛徒达赖到东南亚国家去从事反华活动，企图破坏那些国家和中国的友好关系。对目前中国正在轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命，印度政府和世界上一切反动势力一样，怕得要死，恨得要命。它除了自己开动宣传机器进行反华叫嚣外，还嗾使叛徒达赖大肆造谣污蔑。所有这一切，都是尽人皆知的铁一般的事实，印度政府是绝对抵赖不了的。
    照会说：必须郑重指出，印度政府今天还同中国维持着外交关系。在这样的情况下，印度政府收容了数以万计的被叛匪裹胁到印度的中国公民，并且八年来一直支持西藏叛匪从事反对中国政府的颠覆活动。这真是世界外交史上罕见的现象。人们不禁要问，究竟印度政府心目中还有没有一丝一毫的国际关系准则？
    照会说：还必须指出，印度政府在大干这些坏事的时候，却胡说什么印度对西藏有一种“基于情感和人道原因的同情”；印度“对中国有着维持友好关系的愿望”，“不允许在印度的西藏难民进行反对中华人民共和国的颠覆性的政治活动”，等等。这真是言不由衷，虚伪透顶。其实，印度政府无时无刻不在用自己的行动剥开自己的画皮。印度政府同情的并不是广大西藏人民，而是那些惯于吃人心、挖人眼的西藏农奴主。印度政府所做的，并不是与中国维持友好关系，而是豢养和训练那些亡命在印度的西藏叛匪，妄图有朝一日让他们打回西藏，重新恢复西藏的农奴制度。说到底，印度政府梦寐以求的，就是要使一个正在成为社会主义乐园的新西藏，重新沦为人间地狱的旧西藏。这是绝对办不到的。
    照会最后指出：印度政府当初继承了英帝国主义的侵略衣钵，现在又积极投靠美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义。印度政府日益放肆地利用所谓西藏问题反华，决不是偶然的。这不过是印度政府内外反动政策的一个表现罢了。中国政府要正告印度政府，如果印度政府继续它的反华政策不变，继续在所谓西藏问题上干涉中国内政，它就必须为由此而引起的严重后果承担责任。
