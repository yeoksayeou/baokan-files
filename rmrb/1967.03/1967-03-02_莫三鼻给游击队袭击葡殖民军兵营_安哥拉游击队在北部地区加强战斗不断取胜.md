Mozambican guerrillas attacked a Portuguese colonial army camp in the Tete region of Niamailevo on the morning of February 8, killing seven Portuguese soldiers and wounding several others.

During the battle, the guerrillas burned two Portuguese military vehicles, several tents, and other military supplies, and seized some weapons and ammunition. They also rescued fifty local residents from the camp. These residents had been forced by the Portuguese colonial army to build bridges and roads to suppress guerrilla activities. They expressed their firm support for the guerrillas' struggle against Portuguese colonialism.

The report also stated that a Portuguese military vehicle carrying fifteen soldiers, en route to Niamailevo to rescue the defeated enemy forces, was blown up by guerrilla fighters.

According to a report from the Angolan guerrillas, the Angolan guerrillas have recently intensified their attacks on Portuguese colonial forces in the northern region, achieving new victories.

The report said that on January 2, in a battle at Republic Fortress, the guerrillas killed twelve Portuguese colonial soldiers. In another battle northeast of the capital Luanda in Dambos, the guerrillas killed another twelve Portuguese colonial soldiers and seized a batch of weapons.

At the end of last year, the guerrillas ambushed a Portuguese colonial patrol team attempting to force its way through the guerrilla base in the Catete region southeast of Luanda, killing eight Portuguese soldiers. In addition, the guerrillas fought battles in the northern regions of Vige Mountain and Macalado Zombo, killing five enemy soldiers.
