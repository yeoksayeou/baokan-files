Listen to Chairman Mao's words, resume classes and make revolution

Middle school revolutionary cadres, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary staff are determined to join the Red Guard youth and revolutionary students to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools to the end. The capital's colleges and universities' Red Guards say that they will definitely unite closely with the middle school Red Guard comrades under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight shoulder to shoulder, and advance bravely.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from middle schools and colleges and universities in the capital enthusiastically congratulate the establishment of the capital middle school Red Guard representatives congress. They enthusiastically acclaim the middle school revolutionary youth's great achievement of realizing revolutionary unity on the basis of the great Mao Zedong Thought. With boundless love for the reddest red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao, they excitedly shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The broad masses of Red Guard youth in middle schools say that the great Red Guard movement, which started from the middle schools in Beijing, has received the greatest support and care from the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. We will forever cherish this glory and forever protect this glory. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to resume classes and make revolution, resolutely execute and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, further realize the great unity of the middle school proletarian revolutionary factions, thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as a small number of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the ranks of teachers and staff and refuse to reform, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end! We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the Party, forever loyal to the people, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary youth have seriously studied the important speeches made by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing at the capital middle school Red Guard representatives congress. They say that this is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest support from the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group for us revolutionary youth. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's earnest expectations. We will concern ourselves with national affairs, carry out the proletarian cultural revolution in schools well, and in the struggle, strive to reform ourselves, and vow to be screws that never rust, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the people of the world revolution wholeheartedly.

The broad masses of Red Guard youth in Beijing's middle schools are launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. While attending classes, rectifying the wind, and fighting, the revolutionary teachers and students' joint command department of Beijing No. 2 Middle School has made a timely decision to carry out rectification throughout the school based on the congress spirit. The first batch of Red Guards from this school who rushed out to society to sweep away the "four olds" of the exploiting classes say that we must sweep away the "four olds" in society and also cleanse the "four olds" in our minds. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the rectification movement, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, to realize the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions throughout the school, to establish a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership cadre, and to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on resuming classes and making revolution and make new contributions. The Red Guards of Beijing No. 25 Middle School say that we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately be liberated. We must overcome factionalism, sectarianism, and individualism and achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. For the leading cadres, teachers, and students who have made mistakes, we must implement the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" and warmly help them recognize and correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The Red Guard youth say that at this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must always heighten our revolutionary vigilance and vow to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and we must not stop halfway. The revolutionary youth of Beijing No. 4 Middle School say: Resuming classes and making revolution means to resume the classes of the proletarian cultural revolution, resolutely implement and execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Currently, the situation of the cultural revolution is excellent, and the future is bright. This is the mainstream, but we must also see that the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been completely eliminated, and there still exists the countercurrent of capitalist restoration. We must resolutely defend the great achievements of the proletarian cultural revolution and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The broad masses of Red Guard youth express that they will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, definitely seize back the middle school education battlefield occupied by bourgeois intellectuals, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all the battlefields of middle schools. They say that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take class struggle as the main course, and truly develop in an active and lively way in all aspects of moral, intellectual, and physical education according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and cultivate themselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

The revolutionary cadres, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary staff of middle schools in Beijing resolutely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to resume classes and make revolution, and are determined to join the Red Guard youth and the broad revolutionary students to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools to the end and turn middle schools into bright red Mao Zedong Thought schools. They express that they will definitely better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, humbly learn from the broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary youth, and while reforming the objective world, reform their subjective world.

The Red Guard fighters of the capital's colleges and universities excitedly say that we have just celebrated the establishment of the college and university revolutionary representatives congress, and today we see our comrades and brothers—the middle school Red Guard youth—achieving great unity and great solidarity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, which is truly a cause for great joy! This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing's important speeches at the middle school revolutionary representatives congress have also greatly encouraged us college and university Red Guard fighters. They say that we and the middle school revolutionary youth are all Red Guards by the side of the great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely unite closely with the middle school Red Guard comrades under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite like steel, fight shoulder to shoulder, advance bravely, and win new victories in the proletarian cultural revolution.
