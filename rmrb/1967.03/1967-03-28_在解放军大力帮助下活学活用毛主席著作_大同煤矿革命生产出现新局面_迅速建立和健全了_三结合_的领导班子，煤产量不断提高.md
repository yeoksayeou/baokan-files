Under the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary workers of the Da Tong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, grasped the revolution, and promoted production. This has led to a new situation of dual victories in revolution and production across the entire mine. In the past month, the attendance rate of workers has continuously increased, and the average daily coal production has doubled compared to before.

The Da Tong Coal Mine is one of the important coal production bases in China. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalists within the Da Tong Municipal Party Committee and the Da Tong Mining Bureau Committee engaged in counter-revolutionary economism, inciting workers to fight among themselves, and encouraging workers to leave their production posts, opposing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production." In a short period, labor discipline across the entire mine became lax, and coal production declined. In late February, under the support of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary workers launched a general offensive against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, firmly grasping the fate of revolution and production across the entire mine, and transforming the entire mine area.

After the People's Liberation Army arrived in the mine area, they emphasized proletarian politics, vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production." Wherever there were masses, they spread Mao Zedong Thought. They organized propaganda teams to enter the mine pits and worker dormitories, allowing Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's series of policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to directly meet with the broad revolutionary masses. The places where the People's Liberation Army conducted propaganda activities became battlefields for revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, expose and denounce the crimes of reactionary organizations, and became rallying points for revolutionary masses to express their determination to grasp the revolution and promote production. Under the strong political offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the reactionary organizations controlled by a small clique of capitalist roaders quickly disintegrated, and the strength of the proletarian revolutionary faction rapidly grew.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses," the People's Liberation Army soldiers entered the mine pits and labored with the miners, conducted investigations and research among the miners' families, and mobilized the broad revolutionary workers and their families to expose and denounce the crimes of the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party who colluded with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who infiltrated the mine area to sabotage the revolution and production. After the cover of class struggle in the mine area was further lifted, the broad revolutionary masses were filled with indignation at the rampant counter-attacks and sabotage crimes of the class enemies, and at the same time, their sense of responsibility as masters of the house was further aroused, greatly enhancing their enthusiasm for grasping the revolution and promoting production. The broad revolutionary workers expressed their determination to quickly establish a new order of revolution and production across the entire mine area and to rapidly increase coal production.

Under the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the Da Tong Coal Mine quickly established and improved the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership cadre. Many revolutionary cadres came forward to express their willingness to work actively and to undergo new tests in revolution and production; some cadres who had made mistakes also began to put down their burdens and expressed their willingness to work hard to make amends. The People's Liberation Army, which had entered the mine area, also focused on militia work, rectified militia organizations, and enhanced the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the militia forces. Under the leadership of the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ, the entire mine area dispatched a large number of cadres to enter the teams, formulated various specific measures to grasp the revolution, promote production, and restore normal production order based on the opinions and demands of the revolutionary masses, and established and improved various post responsibility systems.

The People's Liberation Army soldiers who had entered the mine area also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "care for the masses' livelihood," leading the living management personnel to send water and dry food to the underground miners, ensuring that the miners could eat hot meals and drink hot water underground. The People's Liberation Army and revolutionary workers forged deep class feelings in their joint labor and joint struggle.

Now, the "four firsts" and "three-eights" style of the People's Liberation Army have begun to take root and blossom in the Da Tong Coal Mine. Miners study Chairman Mao's works before and after shifts, and production teams have launched competitions to grasp the revolution and promote production. Workers often conduct criticism and self-criticism, and those who are active in the revolution and work hard are promptly praised, forming a new atmosphere of self-education among the masses.

    在解放军大力帮助下活学活用毛主席著作
    大同煤矿革命生产出现新局面
    迅速建立和健全了“三结合”的领导班子，煤产量不断提高
    新华社太原二十六日电　山西大同煤矿革命职工在中国人民解放军某部指战员的支持和帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全矿区出现了革命、生产双胜利的新局面。近一个月来，这个矿的职工出勤率不断提高，煤炭平均日产量比过去提高了一倍。
    大同煤矿是我国重要的煤炭生产基地之一。在无产阶级文化大革命中，大同市委和大同矿务局党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大搞反革命经济主义，挑动群众斗群众，煽动工人离开生产岗位，对抗毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。在短暂的时间内，全矿区劳动纪律松弛，煤炭生产下降。二月下旬，广大革命职工在深入矿区的人民解放军某部指战员支持下，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击，牢牢掌握了全矿区革命和生产的命运，使整个矿区的面貌焕然一新。
    人民解放军某部指战员来到矿区以后，他们突出无产阶级政治，大力宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，那里有群众就把毛泽东思想传播到那里。他们组织宣传队深入矿井和职工宿舍区，让毛主席和党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列方针政策直接和广大革命群众见面。人民解放军进行宣传活动的场所，有的成了革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，揭露和控诉反动组织罪行的阵地，有的成了革命群众表示一定要狠抓革命，猛促生产的誓师大会。在人民解放军开展的强大政治攻势下，一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的反动组织迅速瓦解，无产阶级革命派的力量迅速壮大。
    遵照毛主席“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”的教导，人民解放军指战员深入矿井和矿工同劳动，深入到矿工家属中去进行调查研究，发动广大革命职工和家属，揭发和控诉党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派勾结混入矿区的地、富、反、坏、右分子破坏革命，破坏生产的罪行。矿区阶级斗争的盖子被进一步揭开后，广大革命群众对阶级敌人的猖狂反扑和破坏罪行气愤填膺，同时也进一步激发起自己当家作主的主人翁责任感，大大增强了抓革命，促生产的积极性。广大革命职工表示，一定要迅速建立整个矿区革命和生产的新秩序，尽快把煤炭生产搞上去。
    在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，大同煤矿迅速建立和健全了革命的“三结合”的领导班子。许多革命干部纷纷站出来表示要积极工作，在革命和生产中经受新的考验；一些犯有错误的干部也开始放下包袱，表示要努力工作，将功补过。深入矿区的人民解放军还大抓民兵工作，整顿民兵组织，增强了民兵队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。在革命的“三结合”临时权力机构领导下，全矿区抽调了一大批干部深入班组，根据革命群众的意见和要求，制定了抓革命，促生产和恢复正常生产秩序的各项具体措施，建立和健全了各种岗位责任制。
    深入矿区的人民解放军指战员，还遵照毛主席“关心群众生活”的教导，带动生活管理人员给井下矿工送水、送干粮，保证矿工们在井下能吃到热饭，喝到热水。人民解放军和革命职工在共同劳动、共同战斗中结下了深厚的阶级感情。
    现在，人民解放军的“四个第一”和“三八作风”在大同煤矿已开始生根开花。矿工们班前、班后学习毛主席著作，班组之间展开了抓革命，促生产竞赛。职工们经常开展批评和自我批评，参加革命积极和劳动好的及时得到表扬，形成了群众自己教育自己的新风气。
