Chairman Mao teaches us: "The tide of the people of the whole world opposing the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the whole world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will certainly win even greater victories."

Latin America, known as the "backyard" of the United States, is currently in the midst of a great revolutionary upheaval. The struggle of the Latin American people against the plunder and oppression of U.S. imperialism and against the fascist dictatorship of their own reactionary regimes is surging forward.

In many countries of Latin America, armed revolutionary struggles in the mountains and rural areas have become an unstoppable blaze, spreading widely.

The Colombian guerrillas, who have been fighting for many years, have grown stronger in the past year of fierce battles against "encirclement and suppression." After repeatedly defeating the government troops armed by U.S. imperialism, the brave people's armed forces have recently taken the initiative to attack and annihilate the enemy. On February 27, the guerrillas attacked a police station, and on March 3, they annihilated a government patrol, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy.

After the revolutionaries in the Dominican Republic organized a large-scale armed uprising in April 1965 and were temporarily defeated by the direct suppression of the U.S. invading army, they have recently reorganized their forces and are waging guerrilla warfare in many mountainous areas of the country. Not long ago, in the mountains of San Jose de Ocoa, brave guerrilla fighters fought against the reactionary government troops.

In Peru, Guatemala, Venezuela, Paraguay, and many other countries, the revolutionary armed struggle of the people is also unfolding. More and more Latin American revolutionaries are realizing that to achieve true independence and liberation, they must seize the gun and persist in the path of armed struggle.

While armed struggles are taking place in many countries, widespread strike struggles, like a surging tide, are erupting in even more countries.

In January and February of this year, laborers in various industries in Argentina held several large-scale strike struggles. Recently, despite the threats from the reactionary Onganía regime to take measures such as firing and other forms of suppression against the strikers, they organized an even larger-scale general strike. On March 1, hundreds of thousands of workers participated in the general strike with high spirits, unanimously protesting the government's reactionary policies that sell out national interests and harm workers' rights.

In Uruguay, strike struggles have been happening one after another since this year. A large strike that broke out on February 24 involved 500,000 participants.

The reactionary government of Colombia, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, openly declared strikes and walkouts "illegal." However, Colombian workers and teachers continue to fight, organizing strikes and walkouts.

From El Salvador in Central America to Chile in South America, in quite a few countries, workers and other laboring people are organizing strike struggles to oppose the brutal exploitation by foreign monopolies and their own reactionary regimes and to defend their own rights.

Since this year, anti-U.S. demonstrations have continuously erupted in the Dominican Republic, Panama, Bolivia, and other countries. People shouted slogans such as "Down with the American imperialists!" and "U.S. imperialism, get out!" In Bolivia, demonstrators also attacked the U.S. consulate, the U.S. news agency, and the office of the U.S. "Peace Corps."

Today, the "backyard" of the United States has become a powder keg behind U.S. imperialism, and a new, greater anti-U.S. storm is brewing.

### 拉丁美洲人民的斗争不可阻挡

    拉丁美洲人民的斗争不可阻挡
    毛主席教导我们：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”
    被称为美国“后院”的拉丁美洲，目前正处于革命的大动荡中。拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义掠夺和压迫，反对本国反动派的法西斯独裁统治的斗争不断高涨。
    在拉丁美洲许多国家的山区和农村，人民革命的武装斗争已成为扑不灭的烈火，正在广泛蔓延。
    坚持了多年斗争的哥伦比亚游击队，在过去一年反“围剿”的激烈搏斗中，发展壮大了。英勇的人民武装力量在不断挫败美帝国主义所武装的政府军的反复“围剿”之后，最近接连主动出击，消灭敌人。二月二十七日游击队袭击了一个警察所，三月三日又消灭了一支政府军的巡逻队，打得敌人魂飞魄散。
    多米尼加的革命者在一九六五年四月组织大规模的武装起义，遭到美国侵略军的直接镇压而暂时失败以后，最近又重新组织力量，在这个国家的许多山区展开游击斗争。不久前，在圣何塞德奥科亚山区，英勇的游击战士同反动政府军进行了战斗。
    在秘鲁、危地马拉、委内瑞拉、巴拉圭等许多国家中，革命的人民武装斗争也正在展开。越来越多的拉丁美洲革命者认识到，要取得真正的独立和解放，必须掌握枪杆子，坚持走武装斗争的道路。
    在许多国家进行武装斗争的同时，规模广泛的罢工斗争，象汹涌的怒潮，在更多的国家中爆发。
    阿根廷各行业劳动者在今年一月、二月间举行了多次规模较大的罢工斗争。最近，他们不顾翁加尼亚反动当局发出的要对罢工者采取解雇和其他镇压措施的威胁，又组织了更大规模的总罢工。三月一日，上百万工人斗志昂扬地参加了总罢工，一致抗议政府所执行的出卖民族利益和损害工人权益的反动政策。
    乌拉圭今年以来罢工斗争一起接一起。二月二十四日爆发的一次大罢工，参加的人数多达五十万。
    哥伦比亚反动当局在美帝国主义指使下，公然宣布罢工、罢教为“非法”。但是，哥伦比亚工人和教员仍然坚持斗争，不断组织罢工、罢教。
    从中美洲的萨尔瓦多到南美洲的智利，在相当多的国家中，工人和其他劳动人民为反对外国垄断资本和本国反动派的残酷剥削、保卫自己的切身权益而组织的罢工斗争到处发生。
    今年以来，多米尼加、巴拿马、玻利维亚等国家连续爆发了反美示威。人们高呼：“打倒美国佬！”“美帝国主义滚出去！”等口号。在玻利维亚，示威者还袭击了美国领事馆、美国新闻处和美国“和平队”的办事处。
    今天，美国“后院”已成了美帝国主义身后的火药桶，一个新的更大的反美风暴正在酝酿中。
