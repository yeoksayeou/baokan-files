The political department of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Shangqiu organized a study session on Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Study and the Current Situation" to support spring farming production. Through boldly exposing their thoughts, voluntarily identifying problems, and linking their personal experiences to their understanding, the enthusiasm of rural cadres, especially those with shortcomings and mistakes, was greatly aroused. They all expressed their determination to put down their burdens and lead the spring farming production with courage, making amends for their past mistakes.

Their experience is: No matter how much support there is, the greatest support is to arm cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Below are the speeches of several rural production brigade cadres at the study session on "Study and the Current Situation."

I will follow Chairman Mao's instructions, put down my burden, and lead everyone to fire the first shot in spring farming production.

Feng Xiuzhen, deputy head of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association, said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "We must advocate putting down burdens and starting the machine among Party cadres." In the early stages of the movement, the Red Guards posted many big-character posters against me. At that time, I thought, I have worked so hard, only to end up with a pile of big-character posters. I felt miserable. From then on, I became lackadaisical in my work. After the PLA comrades organized us to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Study and the Current Situation," my mind began to clear. Wasn't I carrying a burden? At a critical moment in class struggle, a Communist Party member should not be frightened by the mass movement, carrying a burden, and becoming an obstacle to the movement. The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. I forgot the Party's nurturing, forgot class struggle, forgot that I am a Communist Party member, and ultimately forgot Chairman Mao's teachings.

I am not very literate, so that night I had my child read "Three Articles" and "Sixteen Points" to me. Chairman Mao said, "Because we serve the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and exposure of our shortcomings." That's right! The masses posting big-character posters is precisely to help cadres progress and urge them to keep revolutionizing. What's wrong with that? In the past, I was afraid of the masses posting big-character posters, which actually meant I was afraid of the revolution, afraid of touching my soul. To put it bluntly, I was afraid of breaking the "self" in my mind. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, put down my burden, start the machine, travel lightly, and lead everyone to seize the revolution and promote production, firing the first shot in spring farming production.

Not daring to boldly grasp work is being a captive of the "self." I must quickly turn around and follow Chairman Mao's instructions to carry the revolution through to the end.

Liu Xianhe, deputy secretary of the Party branch, said: Currently, it is the busy season for spring farming production, and time waits for no one! Now is the time to give full play to the role of young people. But then I thought, if I do this, will the masses say I am using the work of grasping young people as a cover to suppress the revolutionary mass movement? It's really the "self" dominating politics, causing dizziness and deviating from the direction.

After the PLA comrades helped us study "Study and the Current Situation," my mind became clear. Chairman Mao said that the "burden" is the "self," and putting down the burden is to eliminate the "self." In the movement, I was hesitant, shrank back, and did not dare to boldly grasp work. Isn't this carrying the burden of the "self"? I scolded myself, Liu Xianhe, you are a Communist Party member, but you have become a captive of the "self," with short-sighted vision, only seeing personal interests under your nose, unable to see the direction of the struggle. This will make you drift away from the poor and lower-middle peasants and away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. You must quickly turn around, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and carry the revolution through to the end! I also thought, the revolutionary mountains and rivers are the blood of revolutionary martyrs. Class enemies are trying every means to make us drop our responsibilities, to realize their plot to suppress the revolution, stop production, and restore capitalism. I must see through the tricks of the class enemies and bravely charge to the front line of spring farming production.

From then on, I went among the masses and, with them, "seized the revolution and promoted production." Practice told me that the masses are the best judges of who is a true revolutionary and who is a false revolutionary. They not only did not say I was "suppressing the revolution" but also helped me come up with ideas and solutions.

Carrying the burden of "permanent redness" leads to blindness, and the road will become narrower and narrower. I must travel lightly and contribute to spring farming production.

Song Huicheng, brigade leader, said: Some time ago, the masses posted a few big-character posters against me, and I felt very resentful. I thought, my family background is good, my roots are red; my social relations are good, all red; I have been educated by the Party since I was young, and now I have joined the Party and become a brigade leader, all red. What problems could there be?

Precisely because of the burden of "permanent redness" in my mind, I did not regard the big-character posters posted by the masses as help for me but thought they were picking on me. From then on, I had a big knot in my mind.

Chairman Mao said: "Many things, if we fall into blindness and lack self-awareness about them, can become our burdens and obstacles. For example: ... working-class and peasant cadres can look down on intellectuals with their glorious origins; ..." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, I was shocked. Isn't this criticizing me?

In this soul-stirring class struggle, I thought I was good at everything, not only unable to humbly accept the opinions of the masses but also thought the masses were picking on me. This is what Chairman Mao said, falling into blindness, lacking self-awareness, and carrying the burden of "permanent redness." The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt, and the more I felt that Chairman Mao's article was criticizing me. At the same time, I deeply realized that the burden of "permanent redness" is actually only regarding oneself as the motive force of the revolution, not continuously regarding oneself as the object of the revolution. Relying on "permanent redness" to eat, the old capital will be exhausted, the road will become narrower and narrower, and one will slip into the quagmire of revisionism. This is such a dangerous road!

From now on, I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, put down my burden, travel lightly, and consciously throw myself into the fiery cultural revolution, together with the masses to seize the revolution and promote production, and contribute to spring farming production.

    “解放军给了我们最宝贵的支援”
    几位生产大队干部在学习《学习和时局》讲用会上的发言
    解放军驻商丘某部政治部的同志，在支援春耕生产的活动中，帮助农村干部，学习了毛主席《学习和时局》这篇光辉的著作。通过大胆亮思想，自觉摆问题，联系自己谈认识，大大调动了农村干部的积极性，特别是有缺点和错误的农村干部，纷纷表示要放下包袱，决心大胆领导春耕生产，将功补过。
    他们的体会是：千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众是最大的支援。下面是几位农村生产大队的干部，在学习《学习和时局》讲用会上的发言。
    我决心听毛主席的话，放下包袱，领着大伙打响春耕生产第一炮。
    大队贫协副主任冯秀珍说：毛主席教导我们：“要在党的干部中间提倡放下包袱和开动机器。”在运动初期，红卫兵小将给我贴了很多大字报。当时我想，我辛辛苦苦地干来干去，到头来落了一堆大字报，心里不是个滋味。从此，对待工作就委靡不振了。这次，解放军同志组织我们学习了毛主席《学习和时局》这篇光辉的著作后，心里开始亮堂了。我不是背上了包袱吗？一个共产党员在阶级斗争的关键时刻，不是挺身而出，冲到第一线去，而是被群众运动吓破了胆，背上了包袱，做了运动的绊脚石。真是越想越惭愧，感到自己忘记了党的培养，忘记了阶级斗争，忘记自己是一个共产党员，归根结底是忘记了毛主席他老人家的教导。
    我识字不多，当天晚上，我叫孩子给我念“老三篇”和“十六条”。毛主席说，“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”对呀！群众贴大字报，正是为了帮助干部进步，鞭策干部不断革命。这又有什么不好呢？以前我怕群众贴大字报，实际上是怕革命，怕触及自己的灵魂，说一千，道一万，就是怕破了头脑里的“私”字。我决心听毛主席的话，放下包袱，开动机器，轻装上阵，领着大伙抓革命、促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮。
    不敢大胆抓工作，这是做了“私”字的俘虏。要赶快回头，听毛主席的话，将革命进行到底。
    党支部副书记刘先和说：当前，正是春耕生产大忙季节，节令不等人啊！现在正是发挥青年突击作用的时候了，得好好地抓一下青年的工作。但转念一想，这样作，群众会不会说我是以抓青年的工作为名，在压制革命的群众运动呢？真是“私”字专了政，头晕方向偏。
    解放军同志帮助我们学习了《学习和时局》后，我心里才清亮了。毛主席说的“包袱”，就是“私”字，放下包袱就是要破除“私”字。
    我在运动中，患得患失，缩手缩脚，不敢大胆抓工作，这不就是背上了“私”字的包袱吗？自己暗暗地责备自己，刘先和啊，你是个共产党员，可做了“私”字的俘虏，目光短浅，只看到鼻子底下的个人利益，看不清斗争的大方向，这就会离开贫下中农，离开毛主席的革命路线，要赶快扭转头来，听毛主席的话，将革命进行到底啊！我还想，革命的江山，是革命先烈用鲜血换来的。阶级敌人正在千方百计地企图让我们撂挑子，以实现他们压革命，停生产，复辟资本主义的阴谋。我一定要识破阶级敌人的花招，勇敢地杀上春耕生产第一线。
    从此，我就走到群众中去，和群众一起“抓革命，促生产”。实践告诉了我，群众是最能检验谁是真革命，谁是假革命的。他们不但不说我“压革命”，还帮我出主意，想办法。
    背上“自来红”的包袱，陷入盲目性，路就会越走越窄。要轻装上阵，为春耕生产作出贡献。
    生产大队长宋会臣说：前些时，群众给我贴了几张大字报，我心里很窝火。心想，我家庭出身好，根子红；社会关系好，一片红；从小受党的教育，现在又入了党，当上大队长，一线红，有什么问题？
    正因为思想上背了“自来红”的包袱，不是把群众贴的大字报看作是对自己的帮助，反而认为是群众和自己过不去。从此，思想上结了个大疙瘩。
    毛主席说：“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。例如：……工农分子，可以自己的光荣出身傲视知识分子；……”对照毛主席的教导一检查，使我大吃一惊，这不正是批评我吗？
    在这场触及灵魂的阶级大搏斗中，我认为自己什么都好，不仅不能虚心地接受群众的意见，反而认为群众是在给自己过不去，这就是毛主席说的，陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，背上了“自来红”的包袱。越想越惭愧，越想越觉得毛主席这篇文章就是批评我的。同时我也深深地认识到，“自来红”的包袱，实际上就是只把自己当作了革命的动力，没有不断地把自己当作革命的对象。靠“自来红”吃饭，老本就会吃光，路就会越走越窄，就会滑到修正主义的泥坑里去，这是多么危险的道路啊！
    往后，我决心听毛主席的话，放下包袱，轻装上阵，自觉地投身到文化大革命的烈火中去，和群众一起抓革命，促生产，为春耕生产作出贡献。
