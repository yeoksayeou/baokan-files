In the midst of sharp, complex, and intense class struggle, the soldiers and officers supported the genuine proletarian revolutionaries, united with and won over the majority of the deceived masses in the reactionary organization, and gave a severe blow to a handful of ringleaders.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 10 — In the process of suppressing a reactionary organization, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tangshan recently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works on correctly handling contradictions among the people, strictly drew the line between enemies and ourselves, correctly handled two types of contradictions of different natures, and effectively exerted the great power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They supported the genuine proletarian revolutionaries, united with and won over the deceived masses, and gave a severe blow to a handful of counterrevolutionaries. The broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically shouted: Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was being thoroughly carried out in the countryside, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants were rising up to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road and were fiercely attacking the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insisted on their reactionary stand, a handful of monsters in Jianhe Village, Fengnan County, in order to save their doomed and dying fate, came out of their holes, colluded with each other, and formed a reactionary organization called the "National Fishery System Rebel Headquarters Jianhe Branch" headed by the released criminal Bijiang You. They madly carried out counterrevolutionary activities. They suppressed newspapers, controlled broadcasts, and strictly sealed off Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's series of major directives concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They vigorously promoted counterrevolutionary economism, divided up all the public welfare funds, public accumulation funds, and production funds. They wantonly destroyed the achievements of the socialist education movement, stirred up a black wind of overturning the Four Clean-ups cases, shouted loudly that the socialist education movement had "gone wrong," cruelly attacked the poor and lower-middle peasants who had emerged as activists in the socialist education movement, and carried out class revenge.

The local garrison unit had long been vigilant against this serious class struggle trend. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the desperate counter-revolutionary plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be politically disarmed and put in a passive position." They made a detailed analysis of the class trends in this extremely sharp, complex, and intense class struggle. As soon as the tails of these monsters showed, the soldiers and officers spotted them and engaged in a head-on struggle with this gang of bad elements. The enemy sealed off information, so the troops broadcasted, printed leaflets, and propagated Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The enemy cruelly attacked the revolutionary youngsters who resolutely fought against them, so the troops, following Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the leftist broad masses, firmly supported the revolutionary youngsters. The enemy incited some uninformed masses to attack the camp, so the soldiers and officers explained the truth to the temporarily deceived masses, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and sent propaganda cars, propaganda teams, and proletarian revolutionaries together to propagate door-to-door among the people.

In this sharp, complex, and intense class struggle, the soldiers and officers of this unit, with the problems at hand, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and on class and class struggle. They realized that to thoroughly defeat the handful of counterrevolutionaries in the so-called "National Fishery System Rebel Headquarters Jianhe Branch" reactionary organization, the key lay in using the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought to educate and win over the majority of the deceived masses in this reactionary organization. How to deal with and educate the deceived masses? The soldiers and officers studied Chairman Mao's works on correctly handling two types of contradictions of different natures and made a class analysis of the deceived masses. Chairman Mao said: "The contradictions among the people are contradictions among people who have fundamental interests in common." The deceived masses are mostly poor and lower-middle peasants who love Chairman Mao and socialism. They were deceived by the enemy and fell into the enemy's trap. The contradictions between the proletarian revolutionaries and the deceived masses are contradictions among the people; while the contradictions with the handful of reactionaries in this reactionary organization are contradictions of an antagonistic nature. After recognizing the nature of the contradictions with the deceived masses, they firmly believed that the majority of the deceived masses could be educated and distinguish right from wrong. Therefore, they, with Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party Central Committee's policies, held various meetings, explained and propagated door-to-door, used democratic methods, presented facts and reasoned, persuaded with reason, patiently educated, and warmly helped them, united with them. As a result, some of the deceived masses quickly distinguished right from wrong and stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, coming forward to expose the enemy.

Through thorough exposure, everyone clearly saw that the handful of ringleaders in the so-called "National Fishery System Rebel Headquarters Jianhe Branch" reactionary organization were all speculators, embezzlers, thieves, and released criminals. They were full of crimes in history and were now disguising themselves as "leftists" and doing evil deeds. These people were undermining the foundations of socialism and attempting to restore capitalism. Everyone's eyes were opened, the line between enemies and ourselves was drawn, and they all stood up to accuse the crimes of this handful of counterrevolutionaries, indignantly saying: "This gang of bad elements is not of the same heart, does not think the same way, and does not walk the same path as us. They are enemies without guns. We must seize their power and must not be deceived by them again."

After distinguishing right from wrong and drawing the line between enemies and ourselves, the troops further led the way, inspiring everyone to find out why they were deceived and where the root lay. After most of the deceived masses became aware, they naturally linked it to their own thoughts and thoroughly dug out the root of the "self." Community member Wang Kailin said: "Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao wants us to break down selfishness and establish public spirit through the Cultural Revolution, but I always think of myself, always want to grab more money. This wolf, Bijiang You, just took advantage of my backward thinking, making me fall into the trap of economism and not see the enemy. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words in the future, thoroughly criticize the selfishness in my mind, and uproot the root of selfishness." The community members all requested to return the money that should not have been divided.

The day the people are happy is the day the counterrevolutionaries are in pain. The broad deceived masses came out, and the handful of counterrevolutionaries in the so-called "National Fishery System Rebel Headquarters Jianhe Branch" reactionary organization had nowhere to hide. At this time, the soldiers and officers launched a powerful political offensive against this handful of bad elements, explained to them the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the followers, and rewarding those who turn themselves in," pointing out the way, and splitting and disintegrating their internal forces.

In order to fight down, fight dirty, and fight to the end this handful of counterrevolutionaries and thoroughly eliminate their evil influence among the people, the troops supported the proletarian revolutionaries in holding a mass meeting to accuse the counterrevolutionary crimes of these bad elements. At the meeting, the masses were indignant and firmly demanded the suppression of this handful of counterrevolutionaries. The People's Liberation Army assisted the public security personnel in arresting Bijiang You and two other ringleaders on the spot according to law.

Chairman Mao said: "In handling disturbances, we should do detailed work and not use simple methods to handle them, and not 'retreat hastily'." After suppressing the counterrevolutionaries, this unit further went deep into the masses to do more work in educating and uniting the masses. An old poor peasant fisherman cried bitterly: "I did wrong, but the soldiers did not blame me and came to care for me. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and return to the right path."

    唐山驻军某部活学活用毛主席著作正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾
    发挥无产阶级专政威力  坚决镇压反革命分子
    在尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级斗争中，指战员支持了真正的无产阶级革命派，团结、争取了反动组织中大多数受蒙蔽的群众，狠狠地打击了一小撮首恶分子
    新华社天津十日电　人民解放军驻唐山地区部队某部最近在镇压一反动组织的过程中，活学活用毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的论著，严格划清敌我界限，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，有力地发挥了无产阶级专政的强大威力，支持了真正的无产阶级革命派，团结、争取了受蒙蔽的群众，狠狠地打击了一小撮反革命分子。广大革命群众热烈欢呼：无产阶级文化大革命万岁！无产阶级专政万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    正当无产阶级文化大革命在农村全面深入地展开，广大贫下中农纷纷起来斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，向坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子猛烈开火的时候，丰南县涧河村的一小撮牛鬼蛇神，为了挽救他们覆灭、死亡的命运，纷纷出笼，互相勾结，组成了以刑满释放分子毕介友为首的所谓“全国水产系统造反总部涧河分团”的反动组织，疯狂地进行反革命活动。他们扣压报纸，控制广播，严密封锁毛主席和党中央有关无产阶级文化大革命的一系列重大指示。他们极力推行反革命经济主义，把全部公益金、公积金和生产基金分光。他们大肆破坏社会主义教育运动成果，大刮翻四清案的黑风，大叫大嚷社会主义教育运动“搞糟了”，残酷打击社会主义教育运动中涌现出来的贫下中农积极分子，实行阶级报复。
    有着高度警惕的当地驻军某部，早就注视着这一严重的阶级斗争的动向。他们牢记着毛主席的教导：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”他们对这场极其尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级斗争中的阶级动向，作了细致的分析，这些牛鬼蛇神的尾巴一露出来，指战员们就看准了他们，同这伙坏蛋展开了针锋相对的斗争。敌人封锁消息，部队就搞广播，印传单，宣传毛主席和党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的方针政策。敌人残酷打击坚决同他们作斗争的革命小将，部队就遵循毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，坚决支持革命小将。敌人煽动一些不明真相的群众，冲击营区，指战员们就向暂时受蒙蔽的群众说明真相，宣传毛泽东思想，并派出宣传车、宣传队和无产阶级革命派一起深入群众逐家逐户的宣传。
    在这场尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级斗争中，这个部队的指战员们带着面临的问题，反复学习了毛主席有关无产阶级文化大革命的教导和关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述。大家认识到要彻底打垮所谓“全国水产系统造反总部涧河分团”这个反动组织中的一小撮反革命分子，关键就在于用威力无穷的毛泽东思想，教育争取这个反动组织中大多数受蒙蔽的群众。怎样对待和教育、争取受蒙蔽的群众？指战员们学习了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的论著，并对受蒙蔽的群众做了阶级分析。毛主席说：“人民内部的矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾。”受蒙蔽的群众大多数是贫下中农，他们是热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义的。他们是受了敌人的骗，上了敌人的当。无产阶级革命派同受蒙骗的群众的矛盾，是属于人民内部矛盾；而同这个反动组织的一小撮反动家伙的矛盾，是敌我性质的矛盾。认清了同受蒙蔽的群众的矛盾性质以后，他们坚信大多数受蒙蔽的群众能够接受教育，分清是非。于是，他们带着毛主席的指示和党中央的政策，召开各种会议，逐人逐户地宣传解释，用民主的方法，摆事实讲道理，以理服人，耐心教育，热情帮助他们，团结他们，结果，受蒙蔽的一些群众很快就分清了是非，站到无产阶级革命派一边，站出来揭露敌人。
    通过充分揭露，大家清楚地看到，原来所谓“全国水产系统造反总部涧河分团”这个反动组织中的一小撮首恶分子，都是一些投机倒把、贪污盗窃、刑满释放的坏分子。他们历史上罪恶累累，现在又伪装“左派”，大干坏事。这些人挖社会主义墙脚，妄图复辟资本主义。大家擦亮了眼睛，划清了敌我界限，纷纷起来控诉这一小撮反革命分子的罪行，气愤地说：“这伙坏蛋，跟我们不是一个心，想的不是一码事，走的不是一条路。他们就是不拿枪的敌人。我们一定要专他们的政，可不能再上他们的当了。”
    分清是非，划清了敌我界限以后，部队又因势利导，启发大家找一找为什么会上当，根子在哪里？大多数受蒙蔽的群众觉悟后，很自然地联系到自己的思想，大挖“私”字的根。社员王凯林说：“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席要我们通过文化大革命破私立公，而我却处处为个人打算，总想多抓几个钱。毕介友这个豺狼，就是利用了我的这个落后思想，使我上了经济主义的圈套，看不清敌人。我今后一定要好好听毛主席的话，大造头脑里私字的反，刨掉私字的根。”社员们纷纷要求把不应该分的钱退回去。
    人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。广大受蒙蔽的群众杀出来了，所谓“全国水产系统造反总部涧河分团”这个反动组织中的一小撮反革命分子就再也无处可躲。这时，指战员们又对这一小撮坏蛋，展开了强大的政治攻势，向他们交代了“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，指明出路，分化瓦解他们的内部。
    为了把这一小撮反革命分子斗倒、斗臭、斗垮，彻底肃清他们在群众中的恶劣影响，部队又支持无产阶级革命派召开了控诉这些坏蛋的反革命罪行的群众大会。会上，群情激愤，坚决要求镇压这一小撮反革命分子。人民解放军协助公安人员当场依法逮捕了毕介友等三个首恶分子。
    毛主席说：“应当在处理闹事的过程中，进行细致的工作，不要用简单的方法去处理，不要‘草率收兵’。”这个部队在镇压反革命分子后，又深入到群众里面去，进一步做教育群众、团结群众的工作。有个贫农老渔工痛哭流涕地说：“我做错了事，解放军不怪我，还来关心我，我要坚决听毛主席的话，回到正道上来。”
