The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the local garrison jointly held a mobilization meeting for the industrial and transportation system to seize the revolution and promote production. They resolutely and swiftly implemented Chairman Mao's great instructions, vowing to be the most outstanding models in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

A communiqué from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines nationwide conveyed the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao. To implement these instructions, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Shanghai jointly held a mobilization meeting for the industrial and transportation system from March 25 to 27.

Revolutionary workers, cadres, militia, and representatives of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai from the industrial and transportation fronts solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao: We will redouble our efforts and strive to be in the forefront. With the most resolute attitude and the swiftest actions, we will unconditionally implement the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We vow to be the most outstanding models in seizing the revolution and promoting production in this phase, and to strive for a double harvest in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial production! We will build Shanghai into a red fortress of the proletarian dictatorship in our great motherland!

Leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, including Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, Nanjing Military Region responsible person Rao Zihe, and PLA leaders in Shanghai, Zhang Jihou, Zhang Yiai, Mei Jisheng, and Zhang Qiang, attended the meeting. Zhang Jihou and Zhang Yiai gave speeches. Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee member Wang Shaoyong presided over the meeting and gave a summary speech. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from various units shared their experiences and insights. Over a thousand leaders from departments, bureaus, companies, and large factories, as well as representatives of the revolutionary masses, engaged in in-depth discussions.

Currently, the industrial and transportation front in Shanghai is in a great situation. Especially after the publication of the "Communiqué from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Nationwide," revolutionary workers and cadres swiftly took action according to the instructions in the communiqué. Some revolutionary mass organizations further carried out rectification to quickly and comprehensively achieve revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," creating conditions for this; more cadres appeared before the masses, returning to the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; many revolutionary mass organization members who had left their posts returned to the workshops and teams to carry out the revolution and production; some factories established "frontline youth shock teams" to strive for the completion and overfulfillment of state plans. Many factories and workshops achieved outstanding production results with high yield and quality, breaking historical records. A new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production is rising.

Through this meeting, the revolutionary workers, cadres, and PLA soldiers stationed in Shanghai's industrial and transportation system enhanced their understanding. Everyone believes that the urgent, common, and important task for the industrial and transportation system at present is to firmly and unshakably further implement revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," quickly establish and improve the command posts for seizing the revolution and promoting production on the frontline, and establish a good order for socialist production.

Many leaders in Shanghai's industrial and transportation system, inspired by Chairman Mao's affectionate guidance, seriously criticized the previous erroneous thoughts of "grievance" (feeling wronged), "fear" (not daring to come forward), "waiting" (waiting for the combination), and "relying" (relying on old merits) at the meeting. With excitement, they expressed: We must not passively wait any longer, must not stand by any longer, must not be afraid of this and that, must not be full of worries, and must not stay in our personal little worlds any longer. We must rise up to respond to Chairman Mao's battle call, break down selfishness, and establish public-mindedness, change fear into daring, change waiting into action, change grievance into learning, stand tall, redouble our efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and go to the frontline of revolution and production to achieve new merits and thoroughly transform ourselves.

Many leaders said in the discussion: We must correctly treat the mass movement and correctly treat ourselves. If we quibble over personal gains and losses in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, forget the grand direction, it is a crime against Chairman Mao, the Party, and the revolutionary people! We must follow Vice Chairman Lin's teachings, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, strictly conduct self-criticism, go to the masses, and be willing to be the masses' students.

Revolutionary worker representatives at the meeting excitedly expressed: Whenever it comes to critical moments of the revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao always points out the direction for the revolutionary masses and revolutionary people, providing the most timely and powerful support. The Party Central Committee's communiqué has again pointed out the direction for us to continue advancing. We support it a thousand times, and we will carry it out ten thousand times, ensuring that every word and sentence is engraved in our minds and implemented in our actions, striving to be the most outstanding models in seizing the revolution and promoting production; striving to be models in firmly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line; striving to be models in firmly implementing the Party Central Committee's decisions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; striving to be models in fighting against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party; striving to be models in implementing revolutionary great unity, opposing factionalism, opposing anarchism, opposing opportunism, opposing economism, and opposing selfishness and individualism.

Representatives pointed out that to become the models Chairman Mao expects, the most fundamental thing is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works, focusing on the "use" aspect, thoroughly transforming our worldview in the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carrying out a revolution in our souls, breaking down selfishness, and establishing public-mindedness. At present, we must particularly wage a life-and-death struggle against all factionalism, individualism, opportunism, etc., that hinder the implementation of revolutionary great unity by units, departments, and systems, and against all anarchism that hinders the implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," such as "oppose everything, exclude everything, overthrow everything." We must resolutely support revolutionary cadres to come forward and seize the revolution and promote production. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our revolutionary will, and resolutely repel the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide. We must continuously enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, turning Shanghai's industrial and transportation system into a great school for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad revolutionary masses on Shanghai's industrial and transportation front most sincerely support Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to not only support the broad leftist masses and agriculture but also support industry, and most enthusiastically acclaim the Party Central Committee's wise decision on "the People's Liberation Army's great assistance to local areas and support for industrial production work." They said, the People's Liberation Army is a model in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must learn from the PLA, closely cooperate with the PLA, and fight shoulder to shoulder!

The PLA soldiers stationed in Shanghai, through the meeting, further studied the "Communiqué from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Nationwide" and were greatly inspired. A large number of PLA officers and soldiers who have rushed to the production frontline and deeply entered hundreds of industrial and transportation enterprises have deeply felt in the struggle practice that the most fundamental support is to arm the broad revolutionary workers and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to even higher hold up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in propaganda and investigation, together with the worker masses and revolutionary cadres, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various problems; through in-depth and detailed investigations, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, clarify the situation, firmly and powerfully support and rely on the genuine revolutionary leftists, unite the broad masses, and do a good job in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and severely strike down the enemy. PLA officers and soldiers also regard supporting industrial and transportation production as a great opportunity to learn from the Shanghai working class.

The mobilization meeting for seizing the revolution and promoting production in Shanghai's industrial and transportation system vividly shows that the Shanghai working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never forget Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and will never forget their responsibilities. The representatives at the meeting unanimously expressed that they will even higher hold up the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the great strategic line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," display their talents, and work hard under the strong support of the PLA, making greater contributions to the motherland and the people.

    上海革命委员会和当地驻军联合召开工交系统抓革命促生产誓师大会
    坚决迅速贯彻毛主席伟大指示
    誓做抓革命促生产最出色模范
    新华社上海二十九日电　中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。为了贯彻这一指示，上海市革命委员会和中国人民解放军驻沪部队，在三月二十五日至二十七日，联合召开了工交系统抓革命促生产誓师大会。
    出席大会的工业、交通战线的革命职工、革命干部、民兵和解放军驻沪部队指战员代表，向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定以最坚决的态度、最迅速的行动，不折不扣地贯彻毛主席、党中央的最新指示，誓做现阶段我国劳动群众中“抓革命，促生产”的最出色的模范，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命和工业生产的双丰收而英勇奋斗！誓把上海建设成为我们伟大祖国无产阶级铁打江山的红色堡垒！
    上海市革命委员会领导成员张春桥、姚文元等同志，南京部队负责人饶子健，人民解放军驻沪三军负责人张吉厚、张宜爱、梅嘉生、张强生等同志出席了大会。张吉厚、张宜爱同志在会上作了报告。上海市革命委员会王少庸同志主持了会议，并作了总结报告。一些单位的革命群众和革命领导干部，介绍了他们的经验和体会。一千多名部、局、公司和大厂的领导干部和无产阶级革命派的代表，进行了深入的讨论。
    当前，上海市工交战线一片大好形势。特别是《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发表以后，广大革命职工和革命干部按信中的指示火速行动起来。一些革命群众组织进一步开展整风，为迅速全面实现革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”积极创造条件；更多的干部在群众面前“亮相”，回到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来；不少革命群众组织的脱产工作人员，纷纷回到车间、班组闹革命，搞生产；有的工厂建立了“火线青年突击队”，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋战。不少工厂、车间创造了高产优质的出色的生产成绩，有的接连打破了历史上的最高纪录。一个“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮正在兴起。
    通过这次大会，上海工交系统的革命职工、革命干部和驻沪部队指战员提高了认识。大家认为：当前工交系统一项急迫的、共同的重要工作，就是坚定不移地进一步实行革命的大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，迅速建立和健全抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，建立社会主义生产的良好秩序。
    上海工交系统的许多领导干部，为我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导所鼓舞，在会上严肃地批判了以前存在的“怨”（委屈）、“怕”（不敢站出来）、“等”（等待结合）、“靠”（靠吃老本）的错误思想，以激动的心情表示：决不能再消极等待，决不能再坐视旁观，决不能再怕这怕那、顾虑重重，再不能钻在个人小天地里打转转了。一定要奋起响应毛主席的战斗号召，大破私字，大立公字，把怕字换成敢字，把等字换成干字，把怨字换成学字，挺起腰杆，鼓足干劲，力争上游，到革命和生产第一线去立新功，彻底改造自己。
    许多领导干部在讨论中说：我们一定要正确对待群众运动，正确对待自己。如果我们在史无前例的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中斤斤计较个人得失，忘记了大方向，就是对毛主席、对党、对革命人民的犯罪！我们一定要按照林副主席的教导，活学活用毛主席著作，严格进行自我批评，到群众中去，甘当群众的小学生。
    参加大会的革命职工代表激动地表示：每当到了革命关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席总是给无产阶级革命派和革命人民指明方向，给以最及时、最有力的支持。党中央的信，又给我们指出了继续前进的方向。我们一千个拥护，一万个照办，一定逐字逐句地印刻在脑子里，不折不扣地落实在行动上，争做抓革命，促生产的最出色的模范；争做坚决执行毛主席的革命路线、批判资产阶级反动路线的模范；争做坚决执行党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定的模范；争做同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争的模范；争做实行革命大联合的模范，反对小团体主义、反对无政府主义、反对风头主义、反对经济主义、反对自私自利的模范。
    代表们指出，要成为毛主席所期望的那样的模范，千条万条，最最根本的一条就是要活学活用毛主席的光辉著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中彻底改造世界观，在自己灵魂深处闹革命，大破私字，大立公字。在当前，特别要与一切妨碍按单位、按部门、按系统实行革命大联合的小团体主义、个人主义、风头主义等等，与一切妨碍实行革命“三结合”的“反对一切、排斥一切、打倒一切”的无政府主义，打一场刺刀见红的肉搏战。一定要最坚决地支持革命的领导干部站出来抓革命、促生产。一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，百倍提高革命警惕，增强革命斗志，坚决打退资本主义反革命复辟逆流。一定要不断提高无产阶级革命派的革命性，科学性和组织纪律性，把上海工交系统办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    上海工交战线的广大革命群众，最衷心地拥护毛主席关于人民解放军不但要支援左派广大群众，支援农业，而且要支援工业的伟大号召，最热烈地欢呼党中央关于“人民解放军大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作”的英明决定。他们说，人民解放军是活学活用毛主席著作的标兵，我们一定要向解放军学习，同解放军紧密合作，并肩战斗！
    中国人民解放军驻沪部队指战员通过大会，进一步学习了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，受到极大鼓舞。已经奔赴生产第一线，深入数百个工交企业单位的大批解放军干部和战士，在斗争实践中深深体会到，千支援，万支援，最最根本的支援，是用毛泽东思想武装广大革命职工和革命干部的头脑。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，很好地做宣传，做调查，同工人群众和革命干部一起，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想回答和解决各种问题；要通过深入细致的调查研究，分清敌我，弄清情况，坚定有力地支持和紧紧依靠真正的革命左派，团结广大群众，搞好革命的“三结合”，狠狠地打击敌人。人民解放军干部战士还把支持工业、交通生产，看作是一次向上海工人阶级学习的最好机会。
    上海工交系统抓革命促生产誓师大会生动地表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工人阶级，一刻也不会忘记毛主席的殷切期望，一刻也不会忘记自己肩上的责任。与会的代表们一致表示，一定要更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战略方针，在解放军的有力支援下，大显身手，大干一场，为祖国、为人民作出更大的贡献。
