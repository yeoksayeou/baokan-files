The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is being carried out vigorously not only in the cities but also in our rural areas. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified of our Cultural Revolution and has spread the rumor that "hundreds of millions of peasants have not participated in this so-called 'proletarian' movement." This is a complete distortion of facts and a blatant lie! You revisionist old gentlemen who are used to spreading rumors, listen up! We poor and lower-middle peasants, as the backbone of the movement, have formed revolutionary committees at various levels, rebelled against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and seized their power. This movement has truly won the hearts of the people! It has greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary forces and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants are deeply grateful for Chairman Mao's wise leadership.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Pingshun County, whether in the past revolutionary and production struggles or in today's Cultural Revolution, have always been advancing victoriously under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and along the path indicated by the Party.

From 1937, when the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression began, to 1949, Chairman Mao led us to defeat Japanese imperialism and overthrow the reactionary Kuomintang regime of Chiang Kai-shek, liberating the people of the entire country. The poor peasants of Xigou have been living a life worse than cattle for generations, with no house to live in and no land to till. After the land reform of 1948, poor Xigou began to change, and life improved.

After national liberation, Chairman Mao led us to organize ourselves, to build socialism thriftily, and to change the face of our poverty-stricken and backward country. In 1952, after we organized the cooperative, we launched a battle against the barren mountains. We planted a forest of ten thousand trees on the stony mountains where there was no soil, built a six-hundred-foot-long stone dam in an eight-li-long stony riverbed, and brought in four hundred mu of land from elsewhere to fill the riverbed. We also formulated three-year, five-year plans and a ten-year perspective plan to change the face of the poor mountainous area. We turned the local area, where farmers were said to lack the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, into a granary. Before 1955, we consumed about thirty to fifty thousand jin of grain supplied by the state each year. In recent years, we have sold fifteen to sixteen thousand jin of grain to the state each year, exceeding the state's procurement quota by four to five thousand jin, and our brigade also has a lot of reserve grain. With the electrification of the village, milling, cutting grass, and threshing in our brigade have all been mechanized. These facts show that without the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we would not have today's happy life. We think this is still not enough. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings to further develop production, support national construction, and support the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world. We must make all class brothers who are still suffering oppression around the world live a good life.

However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have attempted to overthrow our socialist society and restore capitalism. They have also tried to undermine the socialist collective economy in the countryside and promote individual economy. If we follow their methods, class differentiation will reappear in China's countryside, and a new exploiting class will emerge. We poor and lower-middle peasants and laboring people will never allow this. After Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Cultural Revolution, we joined this class struggle, exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and brought down the arrogance of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We proletarian revolutionaries have truly become masters of the country and seized power.

Since 1944, I have attended dozens of meetings for heroes and model workers and have been elected three times as a representative to the National People's Congress. In this Cultural Revolution, we seized the power of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and established the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Everyone elected me as a member of the Revolutionary Committee and the head of the production command post on the front line. In the Jin Dongnan Special District, I am a member of the temporary core group of the Revolutionary Headquarters, and I am also the deputy head of the core group of the Revolutionary Headquarters and the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Pingshun County. We poor and lower-middle peasants and laboring people are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," shouldering the double burden of revolution and production, and taking the lead everywhere, standing at the forefront of the movement. These facts show how despicable and shameful the Soviet revisionist leadership's slander of our Cultural Revolution and hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants is.

In 1952, I visited the Soviet Union. I lived in a village in Ukraine for three months. I personally felt the special enthusiasm of the collective farm members in the Soviet Union for our Chinese peasants. The laboring people of our two countries understand each other very well. We are truly like one family, truly heart to heart. The Soviet revisionist leadership wants to use slander and lies to deceive the Soviet people and destroy the friendship between our two peoples. I believe that the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union will never be fooled by them. One day, the flames of the proletarian cultural revolution will also burn in the Soviet Union. The Soviet people will surely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership. The red flag of Leninism will surely fly high again over the Soviet land.

### 痛击苏修对咱中国农民的诬蔑

    痛击苏修对咱中国农民的诬蔑
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅在城市，在咱们农村也是搞得轰轰烈烈。可是，苏修领导集团对我们的文化大革命怕得要死，竟造谣说什么“数亿农民都没有参加这个名为‘无产阶级的’运动”。真是颠倒黑白，睁着眼睛说瞎话！惯于造谣的修正主义老爷们，听着吧！咱们贫下中农作为运动的骨干，组成了各级的革命委员会，造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，夺了他们的权。这次运动真是深入人心！大长了咱们无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了一小撮反革命修正主义分子和地富反坏右的威风。这真是毛泽东思想的伟大的胜利，咱们贫下中农打心眼儿里感激毛主席的英明领导。
    我们平顺县的广大贫下中农，无论在过去的革命和生产斗争中，还是在今天的文化大革命中，一直是在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，按照党所指引的道路胜利前进的。
    从一九三七年抗日战争开始到一九四九年，毛主席领导我们打败了日本帝国主义，打倒了蒋介石国民党反动派，全国人民得到翻身解放。我们西沟的贫下中农过去世世代代都是房无一间，地无一垄，过着牛马不如的生活。一九四八年土地改革以后，穷西沟就开始变了样，生活得到了改善。
    全国解放以后，毛主席领导我们组织起来，勤俭办社，改变我国一穷二白的面貌。一九五二年我们组织了合作社以后，就对穷山沟展开了一场战斗。我们在没有土的石山上造了万木林，在八里长的石河滩里，修建了六百多丈长的大石坝，又从别处取土在河滩里垫了四百多亩土地。我们还制订了改变穷山区面貌的三年、五年计划和十年的远景规划。我们把当地农民叫做“金木水火土五行俱缺”的穷山沟变成了米粮川。一九五五年以前，我们每年要消费国家供应的粮食约三万到五万斤。最近几年，我们每年卖给国家的粮食有十五、六万斤，超过国家征购任务四、五万斤，另外我们大队还存有很多储备粮。随着村里的电气化，我们大队里磨面、切草和脱粒都已经机械化了。这些事实说明，没有毛主席和共产党的正确领导，我们就不会有今天的幸福生活。我们认为这还不够，我们还要遵照毛主席的教导，进一步发展生产，支援国家建设，支援世界被压迫人民的革命斗争。我们一定要使全世界所有仍在遭受压迫的阶级兄弟也能过美好的生活。
    但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，竟然妄想推翻我们的社会主义社会，搞资本主义复辟。他们在农村同样是瓦解社会主义的集体经济，发展个体经济。如果照他们的办法去做，中国农村又要出现阶级分化，出现新的剥削阶级。我们贫下中农和劳动人民坚决不答应。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命开展以后，我们就投入了这场阶级斗争，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把地富反坏右的威风打了下去。我们无产阶级革命派真正当家做主，真正掌了权。
    从一九四四年起，我参加过几十次英雄模范会议，又接连三次被选为全国人民代表大会的代表。在这次文化大革命中，我们夺了省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，建立了山西省革命委员会，大家选我当了革命委员会委员和生产第一线指挥部的负责人。在晋东南专区，我是造反总指挥部临时核心组的成员，我也是平顺县造反总指挥部核心组副组长和革命委员会的主任委员。我们贫下中农和劳动人民，正在响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，挑起革命和生产的两副重担，处处打先锋，站在运动的最前面。这些事实说明，苏修领导集团对我们的文化大革命和我国数亿农民的诬蔑，是多么卑劣，多么可耻。
    一九五二年我访问过苏联。我在乌克兰的农村住过三个月。我亲身体会到苏联集体农庄庄员对咱们中国农民是特别热情的。我们两国劳动人民相互十分了解。我们真是亲如一家，真是心连心。苏修领导集团妄想用造谣诬蔑的办法欺骗苏联人民，破坏我们两国人民之间的友谊。我相信苏联的广大劳动人民是决不会上他们的当的。终有一天，苏联的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火也会燃烧起来。苏联人民必将会起来造苏修领导集团的反。列宁主义的红旗必将重新在苏维埃大地上高高飘扬。
