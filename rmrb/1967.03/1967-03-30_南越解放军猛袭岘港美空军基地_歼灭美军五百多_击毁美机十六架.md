The South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the U.S. air base in Da Nang early on the 15th. According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the liberation forces of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam fiercely attacked the U.S. air base in Da Nang early on the 15th, annihilating 586 U.S. aggressor troops, destroying 16 jet aircraft, damaging several more, destroying 31 military vehicles, burning 2 million liters of fuel, and destroying many buildings within the base.

The report said that during this attack, the artillery shells fired by the liberation forces were highly concentrated and accurate, hitting the base's runway, parking lot, fuel depot, and the living quarters of the American aggressors. The base was immediately engulfed in explosions, thick smoke, and flames. The American aggressors stationed in and around Da Nang city were terrified, continuously sounding alarms, but they dared not send troops to rescue.

They smashed a "sweeping" operation launched by nearly 2,000 U.S. aggressor troops, annihilating nearly 200 U.S. aggressor troops and shooting down 3 helicopters.

The liberation forces of Thua Thien Province launched a fierce attack on the military outpost of Phu Vang County, Phu Chau, southeast of Hue City, late on the night of March 10. After 15 minutes of intense battle, the liberation forces captured the command post of this military outpost, annihilated an entire puppet security company, severely damaged four platoons, seized more than 50 weapons, and burned down an ammunition depot.
