The People's Army Newspaper calls for further emphasis on the will to fight to the end and defeat the enemy, turning hatred into action and charging towards the enemy, and resolutely smashing all of the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation" actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 1: The Vietnamese People's Army Newspaper published a commentary today, stating that the Vietnamese military and people must strike hard and fiercely, resolutely smashing all of the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation" actions.

The commentary lists numerous facts, exposing the U.S. imperialists' recent intensification of sending troops to invade South Vietnam, launching a series of "sweeps," strengthening air raids on North Vietnam, shelling coastal areas, and laying mines, among other war "escalation" activities. The commentary continues: "The aforementioned war 'escalation' actions by the Johnson clique are all part of their long-planned scheme to intensify the war of aggression."

The commentary states: Johnson believes that for the United States, the path of expanding the war of aggression is the "best path." Johnson's so-called "best path" is actually nothing strange, because aggression is his inherent nature.

The commentary states: "The U.S. imperialists continue to use the war of aggression as their 'best path,' and our entire people will resolutely counter it with a people's war, making it sink into the mire of complete failure. Our entire military and people must continue to teach the U.S. aggressors a lesson they deserve on the battlefield."

The commentary states that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam emphasized in its February 28 statement: "As long as there are U.S. aggressor troops on the beloved homeland of the South Vietnamese people, they will never lay down their arms!"

The commentary states: "Our entire military and people are resolute in fighting until we completely achieve our most sacred basic national rights: the independence and unification of the motherland."

The commentary states: "On the basis of the glorious victories achieved by our military and people in the South and North, we will further emphasize the will to fight to the end and defeat the enemy, turning hatred into action and charging towards the enemy. We will strike, strike hard and fiercely, resolutely smashing all of the Johnson clique's war 'escalation' means, standing shoulder to shoulder with the heroic military and people of the South, delivering a fatal blow to the U.S. bandits and their lackeys, and ultimately smashing their aggressive ambitions."

    越《人民军队报》号召进一步发扬决战决胜的意志
    把仇恨变为行动，向敌人冲锋

    新华社河内一日电　越南《人民军队报》一日发表评论指出，越南军民要狠狠地打，猛烈地打，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的一切战争“升级”行动。
    评论列举大量事实，揭露美帝国主义最近加紧向越南南方增派侵略军，发动一系列“扫荡”，对越南北方加强空袭、炮轰沿海地区、投放水雷等战争“升级”活动。评论接着指出：“约翰逊集团的上述战争‘升级’行动，都是它们蓄谋已久的加强侵略战争的计划的组成部分。”
    评论说：约翰逊认为，对美国来说，扩大侵略战争的道路是“最好的道路”。约翰逊的所谓“最好的道路”，实际上并没有什么奇怪，因为侵略本来就是他的本性。
    评论说：“美帝国主义继续用侵略战争作为它的‘最好的道路’，我国全体人民就坚决用人民战争还击它，使它淹没在彻底失败的泥潭中。我国全体军民要继续在战场上给美国侵略者以应得的教训。”
    评论说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会在二月二十八日的声明中已经强调指出：“只要他们（越南南方人民）可爱的祖国的国土上还有美国侵略军的时候，他们就决不会放下武器！”
    评论说：“我国全体军民坚决战斗到完全取得最神圣的基本民族权利：祖国的独立和统一。”
    评论说：“我国军民在南北两方取得辉煌胜利的基础上，进一步发扬决战决胜意志，把仇恨变为行动，向敌人冲锋。我们打，狠狠地打，猛烈地打，坚决粉碎约翰逊集团的一切战争‘升级’手段，同英雄的南方军民并肩站在一起，给予美国强盗及其走狗以致命的打击，进而粉碎它的侵略野心。”
