The China People's Association for Peace and Disarmament and 11 other organizations issued a joint statement on the situation in Vietnam. The full text is as follows:

Recently, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued statements strongly condemning the new escalation of the war by U.S. imperialism. They solemnly reaffirmed the serious stance of the National Liberation Front's March 22, 1965, Five-Point Declaration and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's April 8, 1965, Four-Point Proposal, expressing the Vietnamese people's resolute determination to resist the U.S. and save the nation. This is the battle oath of the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, a powerful response to the new war threats of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people firmly support the just stance of the Vietnamese people in resisting the U.S. and saving the nation. On March 5, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country issued a statement on the new developments in the situation in Vietnam. We fully endorse this statement.

Currently, U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly brazen in playing the counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy. After the failure of the Johnson administration's "bombing halt" trick in February, it adopted a new war escalation, attempting to continue increasing military pressure on Vietnam "to force peace through war." They launched an unprecedented "dry season offensive" in South Vietnam, while intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam and dropping mines into many rivers in North Vietnam. The head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, arrogantly declared that "pressure must be maintained," that the U.S. "must firmly follow the current path," attempting to use new military threats to force the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has consistently served the "peace talks" plot of U.S. imperialism, actively acting as the number one accomplice in the U.S.'s expansion of the war of aggression. Recently, the Soviet revisionist leaders, including Kosygin, personally took action, running around everywhere, more blatantly engaging in treacherous activities to betray the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. The Soviet-British talks held in London in February were, in fact, a Far Eastern Munich planned by the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, a counter-revolutionary black meeting aimed at extinguishing the flames of the Vietnamese revolution. All evidence proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership has always been a shameful traitor to the Vietnamese people, the most insidious enemy of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S.

The Vietnamese people are a great nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition. They will not be intimidated by the military threats of U.S. imperialism, nor will they be deceived by the "peace talks" plots of U.S. imperialism. Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, has long pointed out: "The U.S. imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to intensify their war of aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of aircraft to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. However, they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist the U.S. and save the nation.... Our entire people and army are united, fearing no hardship or sacrifice, and are determined to fight to the end for a complete victory." Currently, U.S. imperialism is facing increasing difficulties in its war of aggression against Vietnam. Its naked war threats precisely indicate that it is in a desperate situation. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The Vietnamese people, by leveraging their strengths, utilizing all favorable conditions, overcoming obstacles on the path forward, and waging a protracted people's war, will certainly be able to put U.S. imperialism to death and achieve the great goal of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the country.

The heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. sets a brilliant example for all oppressed nations and peoples in their struggle for liberation. The Chinese people have always unwaveringly regarded supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people as our internationalist duty. Currently, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the great proletarian cultural revolution is unfolding in a magnificent manner, which will make our people more revolutionary in thought, spirited, and full of fighting spirit, playing an even greater role in supporting the Vietnamese people and opposing the U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, vow to be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people. We are willing to make any national sacrifice to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the war of resistance against the U.S. to the final victory.

Victory to Vietnam! Defeat to U.S. imperialism!

### 我国十二团体就越南局势发表联合声明  坚决支持越南人民打到底

    我国十二团体就越南局势发表联合声明
    坚决支持越南人民打到底
    新华社八日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等十二个团体关于越南局势的联合声明，全文如下：
    最近，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国外交部分别发表声明，严厉谴责了美帝国主义新的战争“升级”罪行，庄严重申了越南南方民族解放阵线一九六五年三月二十二日五点声明和越南民主共和国一九六五年四月八日四项主张的严正立场，表达了越南人民抗美救国的坚强决心。这是三千一百万英雄的越南人民决心彻底打败美国侵略者的战斗誓言，是对美帝国主义新的战争讹诈的有力回击。中国人民坚决支持兄弟的越南人民抗美救国的正义立场。我国外交部于三月五日就越南局势的新发展发表了声明。我们完全拥护这个声明。
    目前，美帝国主义正在越来越猖狂地玩弄反革命两手政策。今年二月，约翰逊政府的“停炸诱降”阴谋破产后，又采取新的战争“升级”，企图继续向越南增加军事压力“以战迫和”。它们在越南南方发动了规模空前的“旱季攻势”，同时加强对越南北方的轰炸，向越南北方许多河流投放水雷。美帝国主义的头子约翰逊气焰嚣张地叫嚷“压力必须坚持下去”，美国“必须坚定地沿着目前道路走下去”，妄图以新的军事讹诈，迫使越南人民放下武器，屈膝投降。
    苏联修正主义领导集团一贯为美帝国主义推行“和谈”阴谋效劳，积极充当美国扩大侵略战争的头号帮凶。最近，苏修头目柯西金等亲自出马，四处奔走，更加露骨地进行叛卖越南人民抗美救国战争的罪恶活动。今年二月间在伦敦举行的苏英会谈，实际上是美英苏三家共同策划的远东慕尼黑，是一个妄图扑灭越南革命烈火的反革命黑会。一切事实证明：苏修领导集团从来就是出卖越南人民的可耻叛徒，是越南人民抗美救国事业的最阴险的敌人。
    越南人民是富有光荣革命传统的伟大民族。他们决不会被美帝国主义的武力威胁所吓倒，也决不会被美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋所欺骗。越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席早就指出：美帝国主义“可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们决不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。……我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”当前，美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中正面临着日益增长的困难。它进行的赤裸裸的战争讹诈，恰恰表明它已陷入走投无路的绝境。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”越南人民发扬自己的长处，利用一切有利条件，排除前进道路上的障碍，进行持久的人民战争，就一定能够把美帝国主义置于死地，胜利地实现解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的伟大目标。
    英雄的越南人民的抗美救国战争，为一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的斗争树立了杰出的榜样。中国人民始终不渝地把支援越南人民的革命斗争，当作自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。目前在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下进行着的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，必将使我国人民更加思想革命化，意气风发，斗志昂扬，为支援越南人民、反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争发挥更大的力量。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。我们不惜付出任何民族牺牲，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到最后胜利。
    越南必胜！美帝必败！
