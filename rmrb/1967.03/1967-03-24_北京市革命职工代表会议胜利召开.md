Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Under the guidance of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress (Workers' Congress) successfully convened on March 22nd in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. Ten thousand revolutionary workers from the capital gathered to celebrate the victory of the proletarian revolutionaries in the factories, mines, and enterprises of the capital under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a congress of great unity among the proletarian revolutionaries, a congress of unity and struggle, a congress to solemnly pledge to carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," a congress to thoroughly repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, to strike down the counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration tide, and to resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

The convening of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress shows that under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class possesses a high degree of revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, attended the meeting to offer warm congratulations and made important instructions.

Also attending to offer congratulations were: Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group; Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group; Comrade Ye Jianying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission; Comrade Xie Fuzhi, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council; Comrade Xiao Hua, a member of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Head of the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army; Comrade Yang Chengwu, an alternate member of the CPC Central Committee and Acting Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army; Comrade Jiang Qing, First Deputy Head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group; and members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Comrades Wang Li, Guan Feng, and Chen Boda. Comrade Chen Boda also spoke at the meeting.

Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech: Today, in our capital—the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress has convened! This is a great event. This congress is of great significance for promoting the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in Beijing, preparing for the establishment of a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, and for grasping revolution and promoting production. I warmly congratulate the success of your congress! He pointed out that industry is the leading force of our socialist motherland's national economy. The working class is the leading force of our people. Recently, the Party Central Committee wrote a letter to the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres of factories, mines, and enterprises nationwide, calling on them to be the most outstanding models of grasping revolution and promoting production. This shows the Party Central Committee's attention to the strength and role of the working class. We are very pleased to see that the Party Central Committee's call has received your active response.

Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized: At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering the stage of great unity among the proletarian revolutionaries and seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The class struggle is still being waged in a very sharp and complex situation. We hope that our dear worker comrades will definitely heighten their revolutionary vigilance. We must implement the great unity of the revolution, adhere to the "three-in-one combination" policy, and resolutely repel the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide. We must not allow a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to restore their power, we must not allow the bourgeois reactionary line to counterattack, we must not allow those who were overthrown in the "Four Cleanups" movement to stage a comeback, and we must not allow landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and other reactionary elements of the exploiting classes to cause trouble. We must resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said: Currently, it is the busy spring planting season. Our peasant brothers have already mobilized to join the spring planting production campaign. We worker brothers must also summon great efforts, strive to be in the forefront, grasp revolution, promote production, support agriculture, and do our utmost to complete and overfulfill the national plan. We hope you will definitely follow the regulations of the CPC Central Committee, strictly observe labor discipline, guard your work posts, adhere to the eight-hour workday, ensure product quality, and fight against all phenomena of neglecting product quality and wasting state property.

Comrade Zhou Enlai specially pointed out: Chairman Mao has called on the People's Liberation Army not only to support the broad leftist masses but also to support industry. The People's Liberation Army has dispatched cadres to some industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing to help you. This is a very important measure. It has great significance for ensuring the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and for maintaining production order. The People's Liberation Army, created by Chairman Mao and directly led by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is a fighting force, a propaganda force, and a work force, and a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. With their support, this is the greatest care and support from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for you. We hope you will learn from them well and cooperate with them.

Comrade Zhou Enlai finally called on: We hope you will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and study and apply Chairman Mao's works and quotations. Focus on the "use" aspect; gradually realize the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries by system, department, and unit; resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely oppose the bourgeois reactionary line, and strive for a double harvest in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial production.

Comrade Chen Boda said in his speech: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the capital where the great leader of the proletariat Chairman Mao is located, in the center of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao, you have initiated this workers' congress, which is of great significance. This heralds the complete victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We hope that the worker comrades will thoroughly discuss the Party Central Committee's ten regulations on grasping revolution and promoting production, thoroughly discuss the recent letter from the Central Committee to the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres of factories, mines, and enterprises nationwide, and implement all the instructions put forward by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in these documents without any deviation. Grasping revolution is the driving force for promoting production. Only by grasping the revolution and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking can we greatly promote the development of production.

Comrade Chen Boda emphasized: In the Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines is very sharp. One is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and the other is the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved great victories and is continuing to win; the bourgeois reactionary line has been defeated and is continuing to suffer defeats. What we face is a bright and excellent situation! Of course, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party do not want to voluntarily retire from the historical stage. A few people who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are trying to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist production by promoting economism. Now there is still a counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration tide. The working class must unite to repel this counter-revolutionary restoration tide.

Comrade Chen Boda pointed out that we believe in the great courage of the worker comrades. The wisdom inspired by great Mao Zedong Thought will definitely bring great contributions to the people of the whole country, and also to the international proletariat and revolutionary people of all countries, on the road of grasping revolution and promoting production. We hope that the worker comrades will be down-to-earth and further realize the great unity of their class. We hope that the worker comrades will unite more closely with the poor and lower-middle peasants, with all laboring masses, with all revolutionary intellectuals, and with all revolutionary forces! We must strictly observe socialist labor discipline, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, and fully give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of collective labor. Worker comrades armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. All this will bring about many miracles in human history that are unforeseen by people at present but completely in accordance with the laws of historical development! Comrades, your victory is the victory of our great motherland, the victory of the proletariat of the whole world, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the capital, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, have displayed the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and have thoroughly criticized a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strike down the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly smash the wanton attacks of counter-revolutionary economism. They thoroughly criticize the "four olds" of the exploiting classes and establish the "four news" of the proletariat. They guard their production posts, unite the broad masses, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production, using the surging momentum released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in production. At present, in the stage of seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the proletarian revolutionaries in the factories, mines, and enterprises of the capital, facing the excellent situation and new combat tasks, under the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, are beginning to gradually implement the great unity of the revolution by system, department, and unit. The representatives of this congress were elected based on the various large enterprises in Beijing. Today's grand gathering is a review of the battle course, a preview of the victorious future, showing that the working class of the capital is determined to hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist industrial production!

The Great Hall of the People was filled with the vigorous revolutionary spirit and fighting atmosphere of the working class. In the center of the stage, a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, was prominently displayed. In the middle of the hall, red banners read: "Long live the great leader, teacher, helmsman, and commander-in-chief Chairman Mao!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Before the meeting began, revolutionary workers from many factories, mines, and enterprises in Beijing, holding reports of overfulfilling the national production plan and newly developed products, and raising portraits of Chairman Mao and banners reading "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal youth," presented their gifts to the congress.

Amidst the majestic singing of "The East Is Red" by ten thousand people, the congress began.

When the congress solemnly read the "Letter from the CPC Central Committee to the Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres of Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Nationwide," the representatives shouted slogans, expressing their resolute response to the great call issued by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in the letter.

Amidst the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and thunderous applause, the congress passed the "Letter of Respect to Chairman Mao." The letter said: "Dear Chairman Mao, it is you who led us to overthrow the rule of the three great enemies and become the masters of the house; it is you who led us to smash the plot of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to restore capitalism, making the socialist mountains and rivers eternal and unchanging; it is you who dispelled the fog for us and pointed out the direction. We love you, believe in you, admire you, and are loyal to you without limit. To defend you, to defend your brilliant thoughts, to defend your proletarian revolutionary line, we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea. No matter how fierce the winds and waves, our working class's red heart for you will never change!"

The congress also passed the "Resolution of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress."

Representatives of the proletarian revolutionaries from the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory, the Beijing Branch of the China Light Industry Products Import and Export Corporation, the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, the Beijing Jianhua Cast Steel Factory, and the Beijing Second Seven Railway Vehicle Factory spoke at the congress. They said in their speeches that we must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and vow to be the most outstanding models of grasping revolution and promoting production for the laboring masses nationwide; vow to be models of resolutely carrying out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line; vow to be models of resolutely carrying out the decisions of the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; vow to be models of resolutely fighting against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; vow to be models of opposing factionalism, anarchism, extremism, economism, and selfishness, and implementing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." While seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must also resolutely repel the counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration tide and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They vowed: We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with all the proletarian revolutionaries in the city, and build Beijing into a red capital that forever shines with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Beijing, the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, the Red Guards of the capital's universities, and the Red Guards of middle schools also spoke at the congress, warmly congratulating and resolutely supporting the convening of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, and celebrating the great unity, great solidarity, and great gathering of the revolutionary workers of the capital under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought! The representative of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army said in his speech: We will resolutely carry out the instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and the decisions of the Party Central Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely highlight proletarian politics, humbly learn from the revolutionary comrades in the factories and mines, firmly stand with the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, realize the various requirements indicated in the letter from the Party Central Committee, shoulder the two heavy burdens of revolution and production, and make new contributions to the Party and the people. He said, we will always stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and be the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionaries. We will take dictatorial measures against those who dare to engage in sabotage activities, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, to ensure the normal conduct of proletarian democracy and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Beijing said in his speech, we revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the core force of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. Without the alliance of workers and peasants, our proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be victorious. Whoever breaks the alliance of workers and peasants is breaking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is dooming the fate of our Party and country. Our revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants will resolutely fight to the end with those who do!

The congress received many congratulatory letters from the proletarian revolutionaries of factories, mines, and enterprises in the capital.

The congress unanimously passed the list of members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Committee, standing committee members, and representatives participating in the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The congress announced: Before the establishment of the municipal revolutionary workers' congress, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress is the highest power organ of the revolutionary workers of the whole city. A standing committee will be set up during the closing period of the congress to handle daily work.

The leaders of various aspects of Beijing who attended the congress included: Wu De, Liu Jianxun, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Zhou Jingfang, Gao Yangwen, Ding Guoyi, and Li Qingquan.

Amidst the majestic singing of "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," the congress concluded successfully. (With photos)

    无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下大会师
    北京市革命职工代表会议胜利召开
    周恩来同志代表毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组到会热烈祝贺。并作了重要指示
    陈伯达、康生、叶剑英、谢富治、萧华、杨成武、江青同志也到会祝贺。陈伯达同志讲了话
    这次大会是无产阶级革命派大联合的大会，是团结、战斗的大会，是坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的誓师大会，是彻底打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，痛击资本主义反革命复辟逆流，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的动员大会。
    新华社二十三日讯　在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边，北京市革命职工代表会议（工代会）三月二十二日在雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂胜利召开了。万名首都革命职工代表济济一堂，欢呼首都厂矿企业无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下胜利会师。这是无产阶级革命派大联合的大会，是团结、战斗的大会，是坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的誓师大会，是彻底打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，痛击资本主义反革命复辟逆流，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的动员大会。
    北京市革命职工代表会议的召开，表现了在毛泽东思想哺育下的工人阶级具有高度的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组，到会热烈祝贺，并且作了重要指示。
    到会热烈祝贺的还有：中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志，中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组顾问康生同志，中共中央政治局委员、中央军委副主席叶剑英同志，中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理谢富治同志，中共中央委员、中央军委文革小组副组长、中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华同志，中共中央候补委员、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武同志，中央文革小组第一副组长江青同志，以及中央文革小组成员王力、关锋、戚本禹同志等。陈伯达同志也在会上讲了话。
    周恩来同志在讲话中指出：今天在我们首都——毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命的中心，北京市的革命职工代表会议召开了！这是一件很大的喜事。这次代表会议对于推动北京市无产阶级革命派的大联合，准备成立革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，对于抓革命，促生产，有着重要的意义。我热烈地祝贺你们的会议成功！他指出，工业是我们社会主义祖国国民经济的主导力量。工人阶级是我国人民的领导力量。最近，党中央写信给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部，号召他们做抓革命，促生产的最出色的模范。这说明党中央对工人阶级的力量和作用的重视。我们很高兴地看到党中央这一号召得到了你们积极的响应。
    周恩来同志强调指出：目前无产阶级文化大革命正进入无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的阶段，阶级斗争还在十分尖锐、复杂的情况下进行着。我们希望亲爱的职工同志们一定要提高革命的警惕。要实行革命的大联合，坚持革命的“三结合”的方针，坚决打退资本主义反革命复辟逆流。绝不许党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派复辟，绝不许资产阶级反动路线反扑，绝不许“四清”运动中那些下台的分子反攻倒算，绝不许地、富、反、坏、右和其他剥削阶级的反动分子乱说乱动。我们要坚决地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    周恩来同志说：当前正是春耕大忙的季节。我们的农民弟兄们已经紧张地动员起来投入春耕生产热潮，我们工人弟兄们更应当鼓足干劲，力争上游，抓革命、促生产，支援农业，为完成和超额完成国家计划尽最大的努力。希望你们一定要按照中共中央的规定，严守劳动纪律，坚守工作岗位，坚持八小时工作制，保证产品质量，和一切不顾产品质量、浪费国家财产的不良现象作斗争。
    周恩来同志特别指出：毛主席号召人民解放军不但要支持左派广大群众，支援农业，而且要支援工业。人民解放军已经派出干部到北京市一些工交企业帮助你们。这是一项很重要的措施。这对保证无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行，对保证生产秩序，都有重大的意义。毛主席所缔造的、林彪副统帅直接领导的人民解放军，是战斗队，又是宣传队，又是工作队，是活学活用毛主席著作的标兵。有他们的支持，这正是毛主席、党中央对你们最大的关怀和支持。希望你们好好地向他们学习，和他们合作。
    周恩来同志最后号召说：希望你们更高地举起伟大的毛泽东思想红旗，突出无产阶级政治，学好“老三篇”，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席语录，在“用”字上狠下功夫；逐步实现按系统、按部门、按单位的无产阶级革命派的大联合；坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对资产阶级反动路线，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命和工业生产双丰收而奋斗。
    陈伯达同志在讲话中说：在无产阶级文化大革命中，在无产阶级伟大领袖毛主席所在地的首都，在毛主席亲自发动的这个无产阶级文化大革命的中心，你们发起这个职工代表会议，是有重大意义的。这预示着我们无产阶级文化大革命必将取得彻底胜利！我们希望工人同志们好好地讨论党中央关于抓革命、促生产的十条规定，好好地讨论中央最近给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的一封信，把毛主席和党中央在这些文件中所提出的各项指示，不折不扣地付之实践。抓革命是促生产的动力。只有抓好革命，促进人的思想革命化，才能大大促进生产的发展。
    陈伯达同志强调指出：在文化大革命中，两条路线的斗争是很尖锐的。一条是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，一条是资产阶级反动路线。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经取得很大胜利，并且在节节胜利；资产阶级反动路线已经惨败了，还在节节惨败。我们面临的，是一片光明，一片大好形势！当然，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不愿自动退出历史舞台。极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们大搞经济主义，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏社会主义生产。现在还有一股资本主义复辟的逆流。工人阶级必须联合起来，击退这股反革命复辟的逆流。
    陈伯达同志指出，我们相信工人同志们的大无畏的英勇气概，工人同志们用伟大毛泽东思想所启发起来的智慧，一定会在抓革命、促生产的道路上，给全国人民，也会给国际无产阶级和各国革命人民，带来伟大的贡献。希望工人同志们脚踏实地，进一步实现自己阶级的革命大联合。希望工人同志们同贫下中农，同一切劳动群众，同一切革命的知识分子，更加紧密地联合起来！必须严格遵守社会主义的劳动纪律，破私立公，充分发挥公共劳动的积极性和创造性。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人同志们，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大破资产阶级反动路线。这一切，必将在人类历史上出现许多为目前人们还意料不到、但又是完全合乎历史发展规律的新奇迹！工人同志们，你们的胜利，就是我们伟大祖国的胜利，就是全世界无产阶级的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利！
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，首都革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，发扬大无畏的无产阶级革命造反精神，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，痛击资产阶级反动路线，彻底粉碎反革命经济主义的猖狂进攻。他们大破剥削阶级的“四旧”，大立无产阶级的“四新”。他们坚守生产岗位，团结广大群众，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲用到生产中去。当前，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的阶段，首都厂矿企业无产阶级革命派，在大好形势和新的战斗任务面前，在伟大领袖毛主席的号召下，正在开始逐步实行按系统、按部门、按单位的革命大联合。这次代表会议代表的产生，就是以北京市的各个大企业为基础来推举的。今天的盛会，是检阅战斗历程的盛会，是展望胜利前程的盛会，显示出首都工人阶级决心更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义工业生产更大胜利而奋勇前进！
    人民大会堂里，充满着工人阶级蓬勃的革命朝气和昂扬的战斗气氛。主席台的中央，高挂着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像。会场正中，挂着“伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的红色标语。大会开始前，北京许多厂矿企业的革命职工，双手拿着超额完成国家生产计划的喜报和试制成功的新产品，高举着毛主席像和“祝毛主席万寿无疆”的锦旗，向大会献礼。
    在万人齐唱《东方红》的雄壮歌声中，大会宣布开始。
    当大会庄重宣读《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》的时候，代表们高呼口号，表示坚决响应毛主席和党中央在信中发出的伟大号召。
    在“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声和暴风雨般的掌声中，大会通过了《给毛主席的致敬信》。信中说：“敬爱的毛主席，是您领导我们推翻了三大敌人的统治，当家作了主人；是您领导我们粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋，使社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色；是您为我们驱散了迷雾，指明了航向。我们对您无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。为了保卫您，为了捍卫您的光辉思想，为了捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。任凭风险浪恶，我们工人阶级忠于您的红心永不变！”
    大会还通过了《北京市革命职工代表会议的决议》。
    北京光华木材厂、中国轻工业品进出口公司北京公司、北京第二机床厂、北京建华铸钢厂和北京二七车辆工厂的无产阶级革命派的代表，先后在大会上发了言。他们在发言中说，我们要努力学习毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，誓作全国劳动群众抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范；誓作坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，批判资产阶级反动路线的模范；誓作坚决执行党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定的模范；誓作同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行坚决斗争的模范；誓作反对小团体主义、反对无政府主义、反对风头主义、反对经济主义、反对自私自利，实行无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”的模范。在当前向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，还要坚决打退资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们宣誓：一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和全市无产阶级革命派联合起来，把北京建设成为一个永远闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的红色首都。
    北京贫下中农代表、人民解放军北京卫戍区的代表、首都大专院校红卫兵代表和中学红卫兵代表，也分别在会上发言，热烈祝贺和坚决支持北京市革命职工代表会议的召开，欢呼首都革命职工在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下的大联合、大团结、大会师！人民解放军北京卫戍区的代表在讲话中表示：坚决执行毛主席、林彪副主席的指示和党中央的决定，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决突出无产阶级政治，虚心向厂矿革命同志学习，坚定地同革命职工、革命干部站在一起，实现中共中央信中指出的各项要求，挑起革命、生产两副重担，为党和人民作出新的贡献。他说，我们永远站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，誓作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。对那些胆敢搞破坏活动的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子，坚决采取专政措施，以保证无产阶级大民主的正常进行，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。北京贫下中农代表发言时说，我们革命的工农兵，是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，是无产阶级革命派大联合的核心力量。没有工农联盟，我们的无产阶级专政就不能巩固，无产阶级文化大革命就不能胜利。谁要是破坏工农联盟，谁就是破坏无产阶级文化大革命，就是要断送我们党和国家的命运，我们革命的贫下中农就要坚决和他斗争到底！
    大会收到了首都厂矿企业无产阶级革命派发来的许多贺信。
