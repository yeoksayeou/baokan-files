The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly protests the heinous crime of US aggressor planes savagely attacking the residential areas along the Red River in Hanoi, the Viet Tri industrial zone, and the city of Vinh on March 12, and the densely populated areas of Thanh Hoa, Ninh Binh, and Hong Gai on March 12 and 13.

The statement points out that these bombings by US imperialism are a very serious new act of "escalation" against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This once again barefacedly exposes the extremely brutal and warlike nature of US imperialism and further unmasked the deception of the Johnson administration's so-called "peace" and "negotiations."

The statement warns the US government that it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from its new criminal actions.

The statement says that the people of North and South Vietnam, who harbor deep hatred for the US aggressors, will give them even more severe and heavy punishment.

The Vietnamese People's Army News and the People's Army News both published commentaries on March 14, strongly condemning the heinous crime of US aggressor planes brazenly bombing the residential areas of Hanoi and many provinces and cities in North Vietnam in recent days. The commentaries point out that the Vietnamese military and people are determined to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call, ready at any time to smash the US aggressors' every mad "escalation" action.

The commentary in the People's Army News says that the US aggressors are stepping up the war. They blatantly declare that these mad war actions are to put pressure on the Vietnamese people. The commentary points out: "We Vietnamese people are not the least bit afraid of their threats and provocations. The clear answer of the Vietnamese people is: resolute struggle." The commentary says that the Vietnamese people see through the deception of US imperialism's so-called "peace talks," which are merely a smokescreen to cover up US imperialism's war actions. The Vietnamese military and people are ready at any time to deal with the enemy's every new adventurist plan.

The commentary in the People's Army News points out that the savage bombing of Hanoi by US imperialism is a new criminal war action by the Johnson clique, part of their extremely mad "escalation" plot.

After pointing out the victories of the military and people of various places in the north in the past two days, shooting down 11 invading US planes and capturing many US air pirates, the commentary calls on the entire military and people to recognize the reactionary nature of the enemy, further heighten vigilance, strengthen their iron will, advance victoriously, and more fiercely strike the enemy, resolutely smashing the extremely mad plot of US imperialism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 12, the Vietnamese People's Army News published a commentary on March 12, strongly condemning the new "escalation" crime of US aggressor planes savagely bombing the industrial zones and residential areas of many provinces and cities in North Vietnam on March 10 and 11. The commentary calls on the Vietnamese military and people to press forward bravely, giving the US aggressors even heavier blows and winning greater victories.

The commentary says that the US aggressors are madly carrying out a new "escalation." The higher they "escalate," the more they have no way out; they will surely be smashed. The Vietnamese military and people are ready at any time to give the US aggressors heavy blows. They have enough strength to smash the US aggressors' every "escalation" action.

    声明指出，美帝国主义进行的这些轰炸，是对越南民主共和国采取极其严重的新的战争“升级”行动。这再一次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义极端残暴的侵略和好战面目，进一步揭穿了约翰逊政府玩弄的所谓谋求“和平”和“谈判”的骗局。
    声明警告美国政府，必须对由它新的罪恶行动所引起的一切后果承担全部责任。
    声明说，对美国侵略强盗怀着高度仇恨的越南北南两方人民，将给它以更为严厉和沉重的惩罚。

    《人民报》的评论说，美国强盗正在加紧扩大战争。它明目张胆地叫嚷，这些疯狂的战争行动是为了对越南人民施加压力。评论指出：“我们越南人民丝毫也不害怕它的讹诈和挑衅。越南人民的明确回答是：坚决战斗”。评论说，越南人民看穿了美帝国主义玩弄的所谓“和平谈判”花招，它只不过是用以掩盖美帝国主义加强战争的行动的烟幕而已。越南军民随时准备对付敌人的一切新的冒险计划。
    《人民军队报》的评论指出，美帝国主义再次野蛮轰炸河内市区，是约翰逊集团的新的罪恶战争行动，是它的极其疯狂的“升级”阴谋的组成部分。
    评论在指出北方各地军民在过去两天中击落入侵美机十一架和俘虏了许多美国飞贼的胜利后，号召全国军民认清敌人的反动本质，进一步提高警惕，增强钢铁般的决心，乘胜前进，更狠地打击敌人，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的极其疯狂的阴谋。

    评论说，美国强盗正在疯狂地进行新的战争“升级”。它“升”得越高，就越没有路可走，它必定被摔死。越南军民随时准备给美国侵略者以沉重的打击，他们有足够的力量粉碎美国侵略者的一切战争“升级”行动。
