According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Colombo, the Vice Chairman of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, Mrs. Tega Gunawadana, recently said at a public discussion on "China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is of great significance to the people in struggle. This is because the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a major blow to imperialism and modern revisionism, and is part of the global struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

She said that the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership are doing their utmost to oppose China. They are also encouraging a small handful of people within China who are taking the capitalist road to attempt a capitalist restoration. She pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is a heavy blow to these elements.

Mrs. Gunawadana said: China is not isolated because it has the genuine support of all true anti-imperialists. She emphasized that China firmly supports national liberation struggles and represents the genuine interests of more than 90% of the world's people.

The Secretary-General of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, Ananda Kumara, said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong is unprecedented in history. It is aimed at consolidating China's proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration. He said that because China is the pillar of the world proletarian revolution and the pillar of the national liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples around the world, defending China's revolution is defending the world's revolution. China's current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has a tremendous impact and influence on the world revolution.

The Secretary-General of the Sri Lanka Journalists Association, D. Jayakody, who recently visited China, highly praised China's great democracy. He said that China's successful implementation of great democracy is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, who has unlimited trust in the people. He pointed out that China's Cultural Revolution, like a surging torrent, is achieving victory after victory.

A member of the Executive Committee of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, Perera, said in his speech that the Communist Party of China, the proletariat, and the Red Guards will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the task of building socialism will be completed more quickly.

He said: "The disciplined behavior of the Red Guards has left a deep impression on us." "We asked them various questions. They enthusiastically answered the questions, were disciplined, polite, and wise."

    锡兰朋友热烈赞扬我国文化大革命
    中国是世界革命的支柱
    据新华社科伦坡电　锡中友好协会副主席特加·古纳瓦达纳夫人最近在这里举行的“中国无产阶级文化大革命”群众讨论会上说，对于斗争中的人民来说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命有极其重大的意义。因为中国目前开展的无产阶级文化大革命是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的巨大打击，是全世界反对帝国主义和修正主义斗争的一部分。
    她说，美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团正在竭尽全力来反对中国，他们还鼓励中国内部的一小撮走资本主义道路的人搞资本主义复辟。她指出，正在开展的中国无产阶级文化大革命是对这些家伙的一个沉重打击。
    古纳瓦达纳夫人说：中国绝不孤立，因为它得到一切真正反帝的人的真正支持。她强调说，中国坚决支持民族解放斗争，它代表了世界百分之九十以上的人民的真正利益。
    锡中友好协会秘书长阿南达·库马拉说：毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的，它是为了巩固中国的无产阶级专政，防止资本主义的复辟。他说，由于中国是世界无产阶级革命的支柱，是全世界被压迫民族和人民解放斗争的支柱，保卫中国的革命，也就是保卫世界的革命。中国当前的无产阶级文化大革命，对世界革命具有巨大的影响和作用。
    最近访问过中国的锡兰新闻工作者协会秘书长达·贾雅科迪高度赞扬中国的大民主。他说，中国成功地实行大民主是由于毛主席的正确领导，毛主席对人民无限信任。他指出，中国的文化大革命象汹涌澎湃的洪流，正在取得一个又一个的胜利。
    锡中友好协会执行委员佩雷拉在发言中说，中国共产党、中国的无产阶级和红卫兵一定把文化大革命进行到底，经过无产阶级文化大革命，建设社会主义的任务就会完成得更快。
    他说：“红卫兵的严守纪律的行为给我们留下了深刻的印象。”“我们向他们提出各种问题。他们热情地回答问题，有纪律，有礼貌，有智慧。”
