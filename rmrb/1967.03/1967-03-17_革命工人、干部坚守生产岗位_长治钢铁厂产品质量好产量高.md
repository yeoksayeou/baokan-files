Revolutionary workers and cadres at the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant are holding fast to their production posts. The plant's product quality is high and production volume is substantial.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Taiyuan, after achieving great unity among the revolutionary masses and seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi Province has actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call. They are vigorously promoting revolution and production. In February, the plant exceeded the state plan by 4.09 percent, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

After seizing power, the revolutionary workers and cadres of the entire Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant have diligently held fast to their production and work posts, adhering to the eight-hour workday. They have achieved outstanding results in production and various other tasks. On February 25, the steelmaking workshop broke the plant's historical record of 236 heats in a straight-type converter, significantly improving the quality of the steel. On the first day of taking power, the revolutionary workers in the small rolling mill produced 284 tons per day, setting a new historical record for the plant's production of 19-centimeter round steel. Since February, the ironmaking workshop has exceeded the plan every day, completing the state plan for the month by 11.75 percent, with all pig iron meeting quality standards.
