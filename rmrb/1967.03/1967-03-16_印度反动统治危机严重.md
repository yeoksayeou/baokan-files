Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reactionaries are so corrupt, so filled with ever-increasing internal strife that cannot be resolved, so despised by the people and so isolated that they are completely isolated. Therefore, they are inevitably heading towards destruction."

India recently held an election. This was a farce staged by the Indian ruling class with the support of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. This election exposed the darkness, corruption, and the failure of India's domestic and foreign policies.

The election held under the rule of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie was merely a deceptive show. To conduct the election, the Indian government dispatched a large number of armed police to suppress the masses. Indian newspapers reported that various states requested the central government to send more police forces, and "the central government sent its own large number of armed forces to fully meet these requests." India's so-called election was actually conducted under police rule.

U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique actively colluded with pro-American and pro-Soviet revisionist politicians, providing them with money and support to win votes and maintain the shaky Indian reactionary regime. The politicians of the landlord and bourgeoisie also took the opportunity of the election to engage in political dealings, corruption, bribery, and all sorts of unscrupulous activities.

Despite all this, in this election, the Indian National Congress, which had been in power for twenty years, suffered an unprecedented defeat. It only secured a slim majority in the central parliament. In the states of Kerala and Madras, it completely failed, and in several other states, it could no longer rule alone. Several prominent figures and core members of the Indian National Congress were defeated, including the Congress President Kamaraj, known as the "kingmaker."

The Indian National Congress, representing the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, implemented policies of intensified exploitation and plundering of the laboring people after coming to power. The result was soaring prices, severe food shortages, and many people surviving by eating tree leaves and wild grass. The country was burdened with heavy debts, and its finances and economy were on the verge of collapse. It pursued a policy of being pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-Chinese, acting as a lackey of U.S. imperialism on the international stage. The series of policies implemented by the Indian National Congress met with strong opposition from the Indian people, and the crisis of India's reactionary rule became increasingly severe.

In the past year, the struggle of the Indian people against reactionary rule has developed further. The Indian National Congress government carried out bloody suppression, but it could not stop the people's struggle. During this election period, the broad masses of people held strikes, demonstrations, ransacked Indian National Congress party offices, burned Indian National Congress party flags, and disrupted their election rallies to resist. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was beaten by the crowd during the election, and the Minister of the Interior, Chavan, was often driven away by shouts of "Go back! We don't want to hear you speak." Incidents of "violent" resistance, such as the attack by more than four thousand farmers in Mangalore County on government officials, have been occurring frequently in India.

Today, the entire India seems to be filled with kindling, and the flames of revolution will surely blaze across the vast land of India!

### 印度反动统治危机严重

    印度反动统治危机严重
    毛主席教导我们：反动派“是那样腐化，那样充满日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立，……因此他们就必不可免地走向灭亡。”
    印度最近举行了一次选举。这是印度统治阶级在美帝国主义和苏修领导集团支持下演出的一幕丑剧。这次选举暴露出印度反动统治的黑暗、腐败和内政外交政策的破产。
    在印度大地主大资产阶级专政下所进行的这次选举，只不过是一场骗人的把戏。为了进行选举，印度政府派出了大批武装警察，镇压群众。印度报纸报道，印度各个邦都向中央要求增派警察部队，“中央政府出动自己的大批武装部队充分满足了这些要求”。印度的所谓选举，实际上是在警察统治下进行的。
    美帝国主义和苏修领导集团，积极拉拢亲美亲苏修的政客，为他们出钱打气，拉拢选票，来维持摇摇欲坠的印度反动政权。地主资产阶级的政客，也乘选举之机，大搞政治交易，贪污腐化，贿赂公行，无奇不有。
    尽管这样，在这次选举中，印度执政二十年的国大党遭到了前所未有的惨败。它在中央议会只取得微弱多数席位。在喀拉拉和马德拉斯两个邦内，它已完全失败，在其他几个邦内也将不能单独执政。国大党的一些头面人物和内阁核心成员纷纷落选，其中包括被称为“王位确定人”的国大党主席卡马拉季等。
    代表大地主大资产阶级利益的国大党上台后，在国内推行了加紧压榨和搜括劳动人民血汗的政策，其结果是物价飞涨，粮食奇缺，许多老百姓靠吃树叶野草度日。外债累累，财政经济处于崩溃的边缘。它对外执行了亲美联苏反华的政策，在国际舞台上充当了美帝的一名走卒。国大党执行的这一系列政策遭到印度人民的强烈反对，印度反动统治的危机越来越严重了。
    一年多来，印度人民反对反动统治的斗争有新的发展。国大党政府进行了血腥镇压，仍然阻止不了人民的斗争。广大人民在这次选举期间纷纷举行罢工、示威，捣毁国大党党部，焚烧国大党党旗，破坏他们的竞选集会来进行反抗。印度总理英迪拉·甘地在竞选中被群众打得鼻青脸肿，内政部长恰范常常在“滚回去！我们不要听你讲话”的吼声中被撵走。象芒吉尔县四千多农民袭击政府官员这样的“暴力”反抗事件在印度此伏彼起。
    今日整个印度好象布满了干柴，革命的烈火必将在印度辽阔土地上熊熊燃烧起来！
