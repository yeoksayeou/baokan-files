Now, some people pretend to care about production, using the complexity of transportation, industrial production technology, and production management as an excuse to oppose the proletarian revolutionary factions from seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The revolutionary workers of the Harbin Railway Bureau and many factory workers have refuted this absurd argument with their actual actions.

Who is most concerned about socialist production? Is it the handful of capitalist-roaders? No, it is they who sabotage socialist production. Only the proletarian revolutionary factions truly understand the principle of "grasp revolution, promote production" and are most concerned about socialist production.

Who can manage socialist production? Is it the so-called "experts" and "professionals" who advocate for the capitalist road? No, absolutely not. They are experts in counter-revolutionary revisionism. Their "professional" skills are in capitalist production. We must break the illusion about them. In fact, those who truly understand the production technology and management of transportation and industrial enterprises are not them, but the revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres.

In all industrial enterprises and transportation units where the leadership has been usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, power must be seized. Overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and establish a revolutionary leadership team composed of representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres, putting the power of production in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. This will mobilize all positive factors and quickly improve the production situation, promoting a leap in production.

The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." Many facts have proven this to be a universal truth.

All comrades who support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao must, in handling the relationship between revolution and production, put revolution in the first place, use revolution to drive and guide production. Only in this way can we implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." Opposing revolution and production, or placing them on an equal footing, are both wrong. Comrades who make such errors should correct them.

All revolutionary workers should learn from the example of the Red Guards of the Harbin Railway Bureau, being both revolutionary pioneers and production models, shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, firmly guarding their production posts, improving labor efficiency, and completing and overfulfilling the state's production plans.

We declare to those bourgeois gentlemen: Your attempts to suppress the revolution, counter-seize power, stage a comeback, and sabotage production will all fail.

History's answer will be:

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party will be overthrown,
The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will achieve great victory,
Socialist production will make a great leap forward!

### 把革命放在首位

    把革命放在首位
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期短评
    现在，有人装做关心生产的样子，借口交通运输和工矿企业生产技术、生产管理的复杂性，反对无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。哈尔滨铁路局的革命职工，许多厂矿的革命职工，用自己的实际行动，对这种荒谬的论调，给予了有力的驳斥。
    是谁最关心社会主义生产？难道是一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派吗？不是，破坏社会主义生产的，正是他们。只有无产阶级革命派，最懂得抓革命、促生产的道理，最关心社会主义生产。
    是谁能够管好社会主义生产？难道是号称“内行”、号称“懂业务”的走资本主义道路的当权派吗？不是，绝对不是。他们是搞反革命修正主义的“内行”。他们的“业务”，是资本主义生产的业务。一定要破除对他们的迷信。事实上，真正懂得交通运输和工矿企业生产技术、生产管理的，不是他们，而是革命的工人，革命的技术人员和革命的干部。
    凡是被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺了领导权的工矿企业和交通运输单位，必须夺权。打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，建立起由革命群众组织的代表、人民解放军的代表、革命干部组成的革命“三结合”的领导班子，把生产大权掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，就能调动一切积极因素，就能很快地改善生产状况，就能推动生产的飞跃发展。
    中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”许多事实证明了这是一个普遍真理。
    一切拥护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的同志，在处理革命和生产的关系问题上，必须把革命放在首位，要以革命来带动生产，统帅生产。这样做，才是贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。把革命和生产对立起来，把革命和生产平列起来，都是不对的。犯这类错误的同志，应当改正。
    一切革命的职工，要学习哈尔滨铁路局红色造反者的榜样，既要做革命的闯将，又要做生产的模范，把革命和生产的两副担子挑起来，坚守生产岗位，提高劳动效率，完成和超额完成国家的生产计划。
    我们奉告那些资产阶级老爷们，你们妄图压革命，反夺权，搞复辟，破坏生产，统统是办不到的。
    历史的回答只能是：
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派被打倒，
    无产阶级文化大革命大胜利，
    社会主义生产大跃进！
