The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the frontline of Fujian have resolutely carried out the instructions of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Military Commission to support local areas in focusing on spring ploughing. They have used every possible means to help the local villages solve practical problems in spring ploughing, making production hot and solid. The following are a few stories from this effort.

	Rescuing the Plough Oxen

	A veterinary inspection team from a certain unit organized a mobile medical team that not only went from village to village, bringing Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production" to the poor and lower-middle peasants, but also went deep into the fields and cattle sheds. They spread knowledge about protecting cattle in the spring, conducted physical examinations for the cattle, and treated sick cattle.

	One day, the team leader Zhao Shanhong of Hongdi Brigade's Jianfeng Production Team came to the veterinary inspection station with a letter of introduction. Veterinarian Du Jiarong opened the letter and saw that it said: "The cattle are foaming at the mouth, breathing rapidly, and coughing continuously. They have not eaten for three days." The comrades at the inspection station thought of the cattle as the treasure of the farmers and decided to rescue them immediately, responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production" with practical actions.

	Veterinarians Du Jiarong and Chen Dong accepted the task of treating the sick cattle. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and threw themselves into a tense battle to rescue the sick cattle. After diagnosis, they found that the cattle had foreign body pneumonia. They gave the sick cattle a large amount of fluids to increase their resistance and reduce their pain. At night, they covered the cattle with straw and took turns nursing them. Du Jiarong also went to the fields to pick a large amount of fresh green grass, leaving it for the cattle to eat at night. During the day, he led the cattle to the wild to graze.

	The cattle, which were thought to be beyond saving, were rescued after nine days of night and day care by the PLA comrades and were "discharged" healthy. The team leader excitedly said, "Thank you, PLA, for saving this sick cattle! Thank you, Chairman Mao, for teaching such good soldiers! We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production to achieve double victories in revolution and production."

	Ploughing the Fields and Preparing for Spring

	By the Wulong River, the fields echoed with songs.

	That was the soldiers of a certain company of the PLA working with the members of the Hongxing Brigade to plough the fields and prepare for spring.

	The five-star soldier Cao Chunchang, who was in charge of raising pigs, heard that the company was going to support the Hongxing Brigade in spring production. The kitchen was arranging to have an early meal, so he quickly returned to the pigsty, hurriedly cooked the feed, and fed the pigs. He thought: Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will go! Supporting local areas in focusing on spring production is a political task that revolutionary soldiers must fulfill. No matter how busy I am, I must participate.

	Company Commander Liu Fuchang and Political Instructor Tang Chengying thought that Cao Chunchang was already very busy taking care of more than twenty pigs, so they advised him not to go. Cao Chunchang firmly disagreed, smiling and saying, "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee call on us to strongly support and help with spring production. We must carry out and implement this 100%. I have already fed the pigs, so please rest assured, leaders."

	In the past, the villagers had an old habit of not working on the "Lantern Festival." This time, they saw the PLA enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call, taking the lead in going to the fields. Thus, the cadres and villagers connected with each other, not only breaking the old habit of going to the fields to work but also launching a labor competition with the PLA.

	White-Clad Soldiers in the Fields

	The white-clad soldiers from various hospitals in the frontline units organized medical and prevention teams to go up the mountains and down to the fields, visiting villages and households. They treated diseases and conducted preventive work for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, protecting the labor force for spring production.

	The chief military doctor, Zhu Shuiying, from a certain hospital in Wuyi Mountain, northern Fujian, led a medical team to climb mountains and cross ridges to the foot of Wuyi Mountain in Nankeng Brigade to treat diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants. A 63-year-old old woman had a severe headache, and her son was extremely anxious and could not concentrate on working in the fields. When the medical team arrived, he was overjoyed and handed his mother over to the PLA for treatment. He immediately went to the fields to work. Military doctor Zhu Shuiying carefully diagnosed and treated the old woman. After taking the medicine, the old woman's spirit improved. She shed tears of joy and said, "Thank you, PLA! I will definitely tell my son to work hard in production. After I recover, I will also strive to participate in production to repay Chairman Mao's concern for us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

	The medical team organized by a certain hospital of the PLA climbed mountains and crossed rivers to Baizhong Commune, spreading Mao Zedong Thought on one hand and treating diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants on the other. They sat with the poor and lower-middle peasants, spreading Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production"; they worked day and night, going from house to house to conduct preventive work for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	The cadres and villagers saw the PLA so enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, actively supporting spring production, and were greatly inspired. The cadres took the lead in going to the fields to work, following the mass line, and making production plans with the villagers, properly arranging this year's spring production. Now, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in this commune is booming, and spring production is thriving. They expressed with full confidence that they would definitely grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, striving for a bumper harvest this year.

    人民战士支援春耕忙
    ——解放军福建前线部队帮助群众生产的小故事
    人民解放军福建前线部队广大指战员，坚决贯彻执行毛主席、党中央和中央军委关于军队大力支援地方抓好春耕生产的指示，千方百计，帮助驻地农村解决春耕生产中的实际问题，使生产搞得热气腾腾，扎扎实实。下面记载的是其中几个故事。
        抢　救　耕　牛
    某部兽医检验所组织的巡回医疗队，不仅走村串户，把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示带给贫下中农，还深入田间、牛舍，给驻地人民公社生产队宣传春季保护耕牛的常识，为耕牛进行体检，治疗病牛。
    一天，红堤大队建丰生产队队长赵善懋拿着一封介绍信，来到兽医检验所，兽医杜家荣打开介绍信一看，上面写着：耕牛口吐白沫，呼吸急促，不断咳嗽，已经三天不吃东西了。检验所同志，想到耕牛是农家宝，决定马上抢救，以实际行动，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。
    兽医杜家荣和陈东眼接受了救治病牛的任务，他们牢记毛主席有关为人民服务的教导，投入一场紧张的抢救病牛的战斗。经过诊断，耕牛患异物肺炎，他们便给病牛大量补液，增加病牛抵抗力和减少痛苦。晚上，给病牛身上盖上稻草，轮流护理。杜家荣还到田间拔来大量鲜嫩青草，留给病牛晚上吃，白天，就牵着牛到野外蹓。
    这头被认为无法救治的病牛，经过解放军同志夜以继日的精心治疗和护理，“住院”九天，终于健康“出院”。生产队长激动地说：“感谢解放军救活了这头病牛，感谢毛主席教导出来的好战士！我们一定遵照毛主席的指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利。”
        耙　田　备　耕
    乌龙江边，田野上传来阵阵歌声。
    那是解放军某部一连指战员同红星大队的社员在田间耙田备耕。
    负责养猪的五好战士曹春昌，这天听说连里要支援红星大队春耕生产，炊事班正在安排提前开饭，他便立即回到猪栏里，赶快煮好饲料喂猪。他想：毛主席指到哪里，我们就奔到哪里！支援地方抓好春耕生产，是革命战士义不容辞的政治任务，再忙我也要参加。
    连长刘富昌和指导员唐承英想到曹春昌一个人负责饲养二十多头猪，已经够忙了，就劝他不要去了。曹春昌坚决不同意，笑着说：“毛主席、党中央号召我们大力支持帮助春耕生产，我们要百分之百地执行，百分之百地照办。我已经把猪喂饱了，请首长完全放心。”
    过去，社员有个老习惯，“元宵”节不出工，出工的社员干多干少，听各人的便。这次，他们看到解放军热烈响应毛主席号召，带头下田，于是干部、社员互相串连，不仅打破老习惯下田劳动生产，而且同解放军开展了劳动竞赛。
        白衣战士到田间
    前线部队各医院的白衣战士纷纷组织医疗防治队上山下田，走村串户，给广大贫下中农治病和防疫，保护春耕生产劳力。
    驻闽北武夷山某医院主治军医朱水英带领医疗组，爬山过岭到武夷山麓的南坑大队为贫下中农治病，一个六十三岁的老大娘头痛很厉害，儿子焦急万分，无心下田劳动。医疗组来了，他喜形于色，把母亲交给解放军护理，自己立即下田生产劳动。军医朱水英给老大娘详细诊断、治疗，老大娘服下了药，精神好起来了。她流着热泪激动地说：“感谢解放军！我一定叫儿子好好生产，我病好后也要争取参加生产，报答毛主席对我们贫下中农的关怀！”
    解放军某医院组织的毛泽东思想宣传队，爬山涉水来到白中公社，一面宣传毛泽东思想，一面为贫下中农看病。他们同贫下中农促膝谈心，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示；夜以继日，挨家挨户给贫下中农进行防疫工作。
    干部、社员们看到解放军这样热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极支援春耕生产，万分鼓舞。干部们纷纷带头下田劳动，走群众路线，和社员一起订生产计划，妥善安排了今年的春耕生产。现在，这个公社的无产阶级文化大革命搞得热气腾腾，春耕生产搞得轰轰烈烈。他们满怀信心地表示，一定要狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取今年粮食大丰收。
