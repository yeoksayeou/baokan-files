China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation signed a joint statement today in Beijing. The joint statement enthusiastically praises the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong as an unprecedented great achievement in human history. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are fully confident of achieving comprehensive victory in the cultural revolution.

The joint statement emphasizes that today, Mao Zedong Thought has transcended national boundaries and become a common wealth of the world, a powerful and sharp ideological weapon for the people of the world to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. Mao Zedong Thought is also the guiding ideology for removing various obstacles and developing the movement for Sino-Japanese friendship and trade.

The joint statement states that the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation to China has personally witnessed the great and decisive victories achieved in the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, the tremendous development of industrial and agricultural production, and the vibrant scene of victory everywhere.

The delegation unanimously believes that the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong is a new stage of deeper and broader development in the Chinese socialist revolution. The proletarian cultural revolution is to uproot the roots of revisionism and capitalist restoration, further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and build a prosperous and strong socialist state that will never change color.

The joint statement states that the proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches the souls of people. The Chinese people, from top to bottom, are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, and cleaning their minds of individualism. Chairman Mao's call to "serve the people" has become the common language and action of 700 million people. The spirit of daring to think, speak, do, and revolutionize has become the style of the Chinese people in the Mao Zedong era. The entire China is full of vigor and confidence.

The proletarian cultural revolution has fully mobilized the socialist enthusiasm hidden in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" has become a great material force.

The proletarian cultural revolution is an unprecedented great achievement in human history. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dare to tread paths that no one has ever trodden and scale peaks that no one has ever scaled. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are fully confident of achieving comprehensive victory in the cultural revolution. The prestige of the Communist Party of China is increasingly high, and the influence of the People's Republic of China in the international arena is increasingly profound.

A small handful of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries have maliciously slandered and defamed the Chinese cultural revolution, further exposing their reactionary nature of consistently opposing China and the progress of humanity, and at the same time proving that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is truly excellent.

The joint statement states that the delegation was deeply moved by visiting the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. The victory of the Chinese revolution is entirely the result of Chairman Mao's wise and correct leadership. It is for this reason that Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people. The source of the strength of the Chinese people comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the entire China has become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In discussing the current world situation, the joint statement states that the world situation is now very good. The struggle of the people of various countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries has achieved great victories. Chairman Mao said: "The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The development of the international situation fully confirms Chairman Mao's great scientific foresight.

American imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world, and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique is the number one accomplice of American imperialism. American imperialism, in order to salvage its failing fate in the aggressive war against Vietnam, is colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, staging a "peace talk" charade, and attempting to extinguish the anti-imperialist flames of the Vietnamese people. Therefore, opposing imperialism necessarily means opposing modern revisionism.

The joint statement states that now, American imperialism is focusing on containing China as a strategic priority. The Sato government of Japan follows American imperialism, pursues economic militarization, intensifies the revival of militarism, and actively serves as the vanguard in containing China. This will inevitably plunge Japan into the abyss of disaster, and the Japanese people must resolutely fight to the end.

Both sides pointed out that to develop Sino-Japanese friendship and trade relations, it is necessary to wage a thorough and decisive struggle against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists.

Chairman Mao said: "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capital and militarist warlords, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." He also said: "The peoples of China and Japan should unite." Developing Sino-Japanese friendship and trade is the common wish of the 800 million people of the two countries and an irresistible historical trend. The just cause will surely triumph. Sino-Japanese friendly trade has a bright future.

The joint statement points out that the movement for Sino-Japanese friendly trade has entered a new stage. Both sides unanimously expressed that they must adhere to the three political principles, three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics in Sino-Japanese relations, stand at the forefront of the movement, and strive for the further development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade.

At the signing ceremony of the joint statement were Vice Chairman Hou Tong of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and other representatives of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade; the delegation leader Kawase Ikkan of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation to China and the delegation members. Those present at the signing ceremony included relevant responsible persons such as Liao Chengzhi and Lu Xiuzhang. Japanese friends in Beijing, Nishisonji Koichi and Suzuki Kazuo, also attended the signing ceremony.

Before the signing ceremony, Chinese and Japanese friends read quotations from Chairman Mao. After the signing, everyone sang "The East Is Red" in unison.

In the evening, delegation leader Kawase Ikkan and delegation secretary-general Hagiwara Sadao held a reception to celebrate the signing of the joint statement.

    毛泽东思想是战胜帝修反的最强大武器
    中国文化大革命是史无前例的伟大创举
    双方表示为促进中日友好和贸易的进一步发展而奋斗
    新华社十七日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本国际贸易促进协会友好贸易访华代表团，今天在北京签署了一项共同声明。共同声明热烈称颂伟大的毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上前所未有的伟大创举；在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指导下，中国人民完全有信心取得文化大革命的全面胜利。
    共同声明强调指出，今天，毛泽东思想已经越过一个国家的范围，成为全世界的共同财富，成为全世界人民战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强大、锐利的思想武器。毛泽东思想也是排除各种障碍、发展中日友好和贸易运动的指导思想。
    共同声明说，日本国际贸易促进协会友好贸易访华代表团亲眼看到了中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的决定性的胜利，工农业生产取得了巨大的发展，到处是一片生气勃勃的胜利景象。
    代表团一致认为：伟大的毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是中国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。无产阶级文化大革命，就是挖掉修正主义和资本主义复辟的根子，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，建立一个永不变色的繁荣富强的社会主义国家。
    共同声明说，无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。中国上下活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，清除头脑中的个人主义。毛主席的“为人民服务”的号召，已经成为七亿人民的共同语言和行动。敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的精神，成为毛泽东时代中国人民的风格。整个中国朝气蓬勃，充满信心。
    无产阶级文化大革命，把蕴藏在亿万人民群众中的社会主义积极性充分地调动起来了。毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，已经成了巨大的物质力量。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上前所未有的伟大创举。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指导下，中国人民完全有信心取得文化大革命的全面胜利。中国共产党的威望越来越高，中华人民共和国在国际间的影响，越来越深远。
    一小撮帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派对中国文化大革命的恶意中伤和无耻诽谤，进一步暴露了他们一贯敌视中国、敌视人类进步事业的反动面目，同时也进一步地证明了中国的无产阶级文化大革命真是好得很。
    共同声明说，代表团表示：代表团参观了中国革命圣地延安，受到了很大的感动。中国革命的胜利，完全是毛主席英明、正确领导的结果。正是因为这样，毛主席是中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳。中国人民的力量源泉，来自伟大的毛泽东思想。现在，全中国已经成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    共同声明在谈到当前的世界形势时说，现在世界局势是一片大好的形势。各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。毛主席说：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。国际局势的发展，完全证实了毛主席这一伟大的科学预见。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人，苏联现代修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。美帝国主义为了挽救它在侵略越南战争中的失败命运，正在与苏修领导集团狼狈为奸，搞“和谈”骗局，妄图扑灭越南人民的反帝烈火。因此，反对帝国主义就必须反对现代修正主义。
    共同声明说，现在，美帝国主义把遏制中国作为战略上的重点。日本佐藤政府追随美帝国主义，进行经济军事化，加紧复活军国主义，积极担当遏制中国的马前卒。这势必重将日本置于灾难的深渊里，日本人民要坚决斗争到底。
    双方指出，为了发展中日友好和贸易关系，就必须同美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏修领导集团及日共修正主义分子进行坚决彻底的斗争。
    毛主席说：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”又说：“中日两国人民要联合起来”。发展中日友好和贸易，是两国八亿人民的共同愿望，是一个不可抗拒的历史潮流。正义的事业，必定胜利。中日友好贸易具有广阔的前途。
    共同声明指出，中日友好贸易运动已经进入一个新的阶段。双方一致表示，必须坚持中日关系的政治三原则、贸易三原则和政治、经济不可分的原则，站在运动的前列，为促进中日友好和贸易的进一步发展而奋斗。
    在共同声明上签字的是，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主任侯桐和中国国际贸易促进委员会的其他代表；日本国际贸易促进协会友好贸易访华代表团团长川濑一贯和代表团成员。参加签字仪式的有各有关方面负责人廖承志、卢绪章等。在北京的日本朋友西园寺公一、铃木一雄也出席了签字仪式。
    签字仪式前，中日两国朋友朗读了毛主席语录，签字以后，大家齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    晚上，代表团团长川濑一贯和代表团秘书长萩原定司举行了招待会，庆祝共同声明的签字。
