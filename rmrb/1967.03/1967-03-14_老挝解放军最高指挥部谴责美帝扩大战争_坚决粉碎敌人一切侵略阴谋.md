	Lao People's Liberation Army General Command Condemns U.S. Imperialism's Expansion of War and Resolutely Crushes All Enemy Invasions

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Khamkeut on the 12th, the Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted a statement from the spokesperson of the Lao People's Liberation Army General Command on the 8th. The statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for their frenzied expansion of the war in Laos and called on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to resolutely crush all enemy invasion plots.

	The statement pointed out that from January 10th to February 22nd, the U.S. imperialists continuously dispatched large batches of aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the liberated areas of Laos. They also sent nearly ten battalions of puppet troops to launch large-scale "sweeps" against the liberated areas. These extremely savage and brutal actions by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys were aimed at suppressing the fighting spirit of the Lao people, occupying the liberated areas of Laos, and creating conditions for the U.S. Army to enter Laos.

	The statement pointed out that the frenzied actions of the U.S. imperialists were a blatant violation of international law and the national sovereignty of Laos, a gross violation of the security of the Lao people, and a serious threat to the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

	The statement said, "The aforementioned evil actions of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys do not threaten the spirit of the Lao military and civilians fighting bravely but only deepen the hatred of the Lao people, making them more determined to defeat them."

	The statement said that the Lao People's Liberation Army General Command calls on all cadres and soldiers of the main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units to further strengthen unity with the people and resolutely crush all invasion plots of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. The statement once again warned the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys that if they persist in expanding the war in Laos, they will face fierce counterattacks from the Lao military and civilians.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Khamkeut on the 13th, the General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front Party Central Committee and the Minister of News, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao Tripartite National Unity Government, Phoumi Vongvichit, recently strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for intensifying their aggression against Laos this year.

	Phoumi Vongvichit pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the U.S. imperialists have continuously dispatched bandit aircraft, including B-52 bombers, to bomb day and night the densely populated areas of central and southern Laos controlled by the Lao Patriotic Front Party. They also spread chemical poisons. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists have also brought many "special forces" from the South Vietnamese puppet troops into the liberated areas, looting the property of the Lao people and stealing intelligence.

	Phoumi Vongvichit pointed out that the intensified and expanded aggression of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys against Laos has made the already serious situation in Laos even more severe.

    老挝解放军最高指挥部谴责美帝扩大战争 
    坚决粉碎敌人一切侵略阴谋  
    据新华社康开十二日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人八日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗疯狂扩大老挝战争的罪行，号召老挝爱国军民坚决粉碎敌人的一切侵略阴谋。
    声明指出，美帝国主义从一月十日到二月二十二日，接连出动大批飞机狂轰滥炸老挝解放区，并且派遣将近十个营傀儡军队向解放区发动大规模的“扫荡”。美帝国主义及其走狗这些极其野蛮和残暴的行动，是为了镇压老挝人民的斗争精神，侵占老挝解放区，为美国陆军进驻老挝创造条件。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的疯狂行径，是对国际法和老挝民族主权的明目张胆的践踏，是对老挝人民安全的粗暴破坏，是对印度支那和东南亚和平的严重威胁。
    声明说，“美帝国主义及其走狗的上述罪恶行动威胁不了老挝军民英勇战斗的精神，而只能更加加深老挝人民的仇恨，使老挝人民更有决心打败它们。”
    声明说，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部号召主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队的全体干部和战士，进一步加强同人民的团结，决心粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的一切侵略阴谋。声明再一次警告美帝国主义及其走狗，如果它们一味顽固地继续扩大老挝战争，它们必将遭到老挝军民的猛烈反击。
    据新华社康开十三日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝三方民族团结政府新闻宣传和游览大臣富米·冯维希最近强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗今年以来加紧侵略老挝的罪行。
    富米·冯维希指出，从今年年初到现在，美帝国主义不断派遣强盗飞机，其中包括B—52型轰炸机，不分日夜地轰炸老挝爱国战线党控制的中寮和下寮的各人口稠密地区，并且撒放化学毒物。他指出，美帝国主义还把许多南越傀儡军队的“特种兵”引进解放区，抢劫老挝人民的财产和窃取情报。
    富米·冯维希指出，美帝国主义及其走狗的这种加剧和扩大侵略老挝的罪恶行动，使已经很严重的老挝局势更加严重。
