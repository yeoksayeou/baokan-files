The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a profound revolution that touches the souls of the people, a revolution to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Chairman Mao said: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological transformation of the entire people."

The great alliance of revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have more broadly and deeply touched the souls of the people, raising the awareness of breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness to a new level. To further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and to carry out a revolution in the depths of the soul, this is an urgent need in the current struggle and also the conscious demand of the broad revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao said: "Every Communist must understand that the words and deeds of Communists must conform to the highest standard of serving the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and being supported by the broadest masses of the people."

Do our words and deeds serve the public or the private? Do they conform to the greatest interests of the broad masses of the people? What standard should we use? It is to see what attitude one takes towards the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao aims to mobilize the masses, overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and eliminate all the old things of the exploiting classes, to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. This line represents the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and the direction of social progress.

The reactionary line of the bourgeoisie is a line serving the restoration of capitalism. This reactionary line suppresses the masses, protects the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and protects all the old things of the exploiting classes. This reactionary line aims to restore capitalism and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. It represents the private interests of the bourgeoisie.

The issue of the line is a major issue concerning whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat and the direction and future of the revolutionary cause. We must care about state affairs and cannot but care about the struggle between the two lines. We must smash the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and achieve ideological transformation. First of all, we must solve the problem of direction and the issue of the line. This is the principle of a revolutionary. If one does not care about, does not understand, lacks awareness, and lacks the ability to discern the issue of the line, one is not a clear-headed revolutionary but a confused person. Without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the struggle between the two lines, to talk about breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness will lead to political confusion.

To be loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is to be loyal to the interests of the proletariat and the people, which is the greatest public-mindedness. Every conscious revolutionary who is wholeheartedly public-minded should firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and on the side of the broad masses of the revolutionary left, and regard the execution and defense of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao as their sacred duty.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Various non-proletarian thoughts exist within the Party, which greatly hinder the execution of the Party's correct line.

The struggle between the two lines, in terms of ideology, is the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. To implement which line is, in essence, the question of using which worldview to transform the objective world.

The bourgeois "selfishness" is the ideological root of the reactionary line. The process of implementing and executing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the process of overcoming various non-proletarian thoughts, and the process of breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. If we do not eliminate the "selfishness" in our minds and establish the proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, we will not be able to properly understand and correctly execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The bourgeois "selfishness" is a corrosive agent and a great enemy of the great alliance of the revolutionary masses. If "selfishness" increases, one will only have oneself and a small group in mind, unable to see the big picture, consider the overall situation, and use big principles to guide small principles, which will cause disunity and organizational laxity. Overcoming selfish thoughts and establishing the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people is the foundation of great unity and great alliance.

Currently, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, while executing Chairman Mao's directive of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and uniting to struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, are also seizing the power of "selfishness" in their minds. The revolutionary warriors of the proletariat are diligently and seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, correcting the tendencies of small-groupism, anarchism, sectarianism, non-organizational views, extreme democratization, individualism, and subjectivism within their ranks according to the line of building the Party and the army stipulated by Chairman Mao in the resolutions of the Gutian Conference, strengthening the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and striving to transform themselves into selfless revolutionaries. This is a sign of the prosperity of the revolutionary ranks and the revolutionary cause.

The conscious breaking down of selfishness and establishing public-mindedness by the broad revolutionary masses is the guarantee of achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only by eliminating the private ownership concept that has existed for thousands of years and establishing the socialist public ownership concept, and by letting Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupy all ideological positions, can we uproot the source of revisionism, thoroughly eliminate the soil that produces revisionism, and ensure that our country will never change color.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has called on the People's Liberation Army to actively support and assist the broad masses of the left. This is the glorious strategic task of our army in the new stage of socialist revolution. To successfully complete the important mission given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao, we must further smash the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, strengthen ideological transformation, and raise the consciousness of executing and defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. With "public-mindedness" as the guiding principle, starting from the interests of the proletariat, the people, the Chinese revolution, and the world revolution, we can recognize the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and understand the struggle between the two lines. We will then be able to stand firmly, hold high our banner, and unite with the broad masses of the revolutionary left, breathe together, share the same fate, fight together, and achieve victory together.

The fundamental weapon for breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness is the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We must, according to the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. All officers and soldiers of the entire army must, in conjunction with the struggle between the two lines, study "The Three Articles" and the resolutions of the Gutian Conference as their guiding principles, thoroughly transform their worldview, and become conscious fighters who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and forever loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In the great struggle to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will achieve new victories for the people!

### 三论提倡一个“公”字

    三论提倡一个“公”字
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的、破私立公的思想大革命。毛主席说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    无产阶级革命派大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争，更广泛、更深入地触及人们的灵魂，把人们对破私立公的认识，提到一个新的高度。进一步活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处闹革命，这是当前斗争的迫切需要，也是广大革命群众的自觉要求。
    毛主席说：“应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”
    我们每一个人的言论和行动，是为公还是为私，是否符合广大人民群众的最大利益，拿什么作标准呢？就是要看他对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线采取什么态度。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，要放手发动群众，斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，革除一切剥削阶级的旧东西，把社会主义革命进行到底。这条路线，代表着最广大人民群众的最根本的利益，代表着社会前进的方向。
    资产阶级反动路线，是为资本主义复辟服务的路线。这条反动路线，压制群众，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，保护一切剥削阶级的旧东西。这条反动路线，就是要复辟资本主义、复辟资产阶级专政。它所代表的，是资产阶级分子的私利。
    路线问题，是关系到要不要无产阶级专政，关系到革命事业的方向和前途的大问题。我们要关心国家大事，就不能不关心两条路线的斗争。我们灭资兴无，破私立公，实现思想革命化，首先就要解决这个方向问题，路线问题。这是革命者的大节。如果对于路线问题不关心，不理解，没有觉悟，没有辨别能力，就不是一个清醒的革命者，就是糊涂人。离开无产阶级文化大革命，离开两条路线的斗争，去谈破私立公，就会在政治上迷失方向。
    忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是忠于无产阶级的利益，忠于人民的利益，就是最大的为公。每一个有觉悟的一心为公的革命战士，都应该坚定不移地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在革命左派广大群众一边，把执行和保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线作为自己的神圣职责。
    毛主席教导我们：党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。
    两条路线的斗争，从思想上来说，是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争。实行什么样的路线，实质上，就是用什么样的世界观改造客观世界的问题。
    资产阶级的“私”字，是反动路线产生的思想根源。贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的过程，就是克服各种非无产阶级思想的过程，就是破私立公的过程。我们头脑里的“私”字不破除，无产阶级的一心为公的世界观不树立，就不可能很好地理解和正确地执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    资产阶级的“私”字，是一种腐蚀剂，是革命派大联合的大敌。“私”字多了，心目中只有自己，只有一个小团体，不能识大体、顾大局、用大道理管小道理，就会使团结涣散，组织松懈。克服私心杂念，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，是大团结的基础，大联合的基础。
    目前，无产阶级革命派，在执行毛主席指示的革命的“三结合”的方针，联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的同时，也夺自己头脑里的“私”字权。无产阶级革命派的战士们正在刻苦地、认真地活学活用毛主席著作，按照毛主席在古田会议决议中规定的建党建军路线，纠正自己队伍中的小团体主义、无政府主义、宗派主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、个人主义、主观主义等等资产阶级思想倾向，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，努力把自己改造成大公无私的革命者。这是革命队伍和革命事业兴旺的表现。
    广大革命群众自觉地破私立公，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的保证。只有破除几千年来的私有观念，建立社会主义的公有观念，让毛泽东思想牢牢地占领一切思想阵地，才能挖掉修正主义的根子，彻底铲除产生修正主义的土壤，使我们国家永不变色。
    我们的伟大统帅毛主席，号召人民解放军积极支持和援助左派广大群众。这是我军在社会主义革命新阶段的光荣战略任务。为了胜利完成党和毛主席交给我们的重任，我们一定要进一步地灭资兴无，破私立公，加强思想革命化，提高执行和保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。“公”字当头，从无产阶级的利益、人民的利益、中国革命和世界革命的利益出发，去认识无产阶级文化大革命，去理解两条路线的斗争，我们就能够立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，就能同革命派广大群众同呼吸，共命运，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    破私立公的根本武器，是伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们一定要按照林彪同志的指示，适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。全军指战员都要结合两条路线的斗争，把“老三篇”和古田会议决议作为座右铭来学，彻底改造世界观，使自己成为一个自觉的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的、永远忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的坚强战士，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功！　　
                                           （三月十四日）
