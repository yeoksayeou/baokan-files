The "two hands" policy is a fundamental principle of our Party's work style. It means that while we are engaged in revolutionary struggles, we must also pay attention to production. This policy is not only applicable to the economic field but also to the cultural and ideological fields. It is a comprehensive policy that guides our work in all areas.

In the current situation, the "two hands" policy is particularly important. On one hand, we must resolutely carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeoisie's academic "authorities" and the revisionist line within the Party. On the other hand, we must also pay attention to the development of production, ensure the stability and growth of the national economy, and improve the people's living standards.

The "two hands" policy is not a compromise but a dialectical unity of opposites. It requires us to handle the relationship between revolutionary struggles and production in a dialectical and flexible manner. We must not neglect one for the other. Only by doing so can we achieve the comprehensive development of our revolution and construction.

In the implementation of the "two hands" policy, we must adhere to the principle of "revolution first, production second." This does not mean that we should neglect production, but rather that we should prioritize revolutionary struggles. In the process of revolutionary struggles, we must also promote production. Only by doing so can we achieve the unity of revolutionary struggles and production.

The "two hands" policy is a creative application of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in China's specific conditions. It is a product of the Chinese people's revolutionary practice and a summary of their experience. It is a guiding principle for our Party's work in the new historical period.

We must deeply understand and firmly implement the "two hands" policy. We must not only criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeoisie's academic "authorities" and the revisionist line within the Party but also promote the development of production. We must not only carry out revolutionary struggles but also ensure the stability and growth of the national economy. Only by doing so can we achieve the comprehensive development of our revolution and construction.
