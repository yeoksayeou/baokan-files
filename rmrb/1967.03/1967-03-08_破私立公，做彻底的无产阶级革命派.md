In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we celebrate this year's March 8th International Women's Day.

I sincerely wish the reddest sun in my heart, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered its decisive stage, and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved decisive great victories.

In the past few months, we proletarian revolutionaries, following Chairman Mao, have braved a winding but victorious path, enduring the storms of class struggle. Today, our position has fundamentally changed, and a more severe test lies before us. The Party and Chairman Mao expect us to quickly mature politically. We will certainly not disappoint the Party and Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always be loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Live to fight for communism! Die to dedicate oneself to the people's interests! Never be a fleeting figure on the stage of history.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not succeed." After we proletarian revolutionaries seize power, we must dare to "revolutionize ourselves." We must study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, touch the soul, fiercely struggle against the "self," consciously transform our thoughts, closely connect with the masses, humbly listen to the masses' opinions, and honestly be the masses' students.

It must be recognized that although a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party have been removed from their positions and deprived of their power, they are not willing to admit defeat and are still waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. The forces of capitalism and revisionism they represent still exist. The old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes are far from being completely swept away. We must always maintain the spirit of revolutionary rebellion and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, proletarian revolutionaries must have a thorough revolution in the depths of their souls, smash the "self" and establish the "public," and seize the power of the "self" in the mind. Drive the "self" out of the door and let the "public" settle down. Only in this way can we ensure that we always correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The struggle to seize the power of the "self" in the mind is a long-term and painful ideological revolution, which cannot be accomplished in one go. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary consciousness and be constantly alert to various non-proletarian thoughts. Only when the "public" seizes the power in the mind can we consolidate the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture that we have seized.

The most powerful ideological weapon to smash the "self" and establish the "public" is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the storms of class struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, especially take the "Three Articles" as our motto, use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to smash the bourgeois command headquarters in our minds; thoroughly criticize the "self." Truly become "a noble person, a pure person, a person of morals, a person free from vulgar interests, a person beneficial to the people." Be a proletarian revolutionary who is always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of your lives, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." We will certainly not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for us. We know that the road to revolutionary victory is winding, and the test of history is severe. We bear the heavy responsibility of the revolution. We will certainly firmly follow our great leader Chairman Mao, ride the winds and break the waves, and march forward forever. Victory will surely belong to the proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    破私立公，做彻底的无产阶级革命派
    北京师范大学井冈山公社　谭厚兰
    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，我们庆祝今年的三八妇女节。
    我衷心敬祝心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命进入决战阶段，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的伟大胜利。
    在过去的几个月里，我们无产阶级革命派跟着毛主席，闯过了曲折的，但是胜利的道路，经受了阶级斗争的大风大浪的考验。今天我们的地位有了根本的变化，更新更严峻的考验又摆在了我们面前。党和毛主席期望我们很快地在政治上成熟起来，我们一定不辜负党和毛主席的期望，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于无产阶级革命事业。生，为共产主义而战斗！死，为人民的利益而献身！决不做历史舞台上昙花一现的人物。
    林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”我们无产阶级革命派掌权后，要勇于“革自己的命”。更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作，触及灵魂，狠斗“私”字，自觉地改造思想，要密切联系群众，虚心听取群众意见，老老实实地当群众的小学生。
    必须认识到，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派虽然被我们罢了官，夺了权。但是，他们并不甘心失败，他们还在伺机反扑。他们所代表的资本主义、修正主义复辟势力仍然存在，剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯还远远没有扫荡以尽。我们必须永远保持革命造反精神，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，无产阶级革命派必须在灵魂深处大闹革命，破私立公，夺头脑中私字的权。把私字扫地出门，让公字安家落户。这样才能保证自己永远正确执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    夺头脑里“私”字的权的斗争，是一场长期的痛苦的思想革命，是不能“毕其功于一役”的。我们一定要保持高度的革命自觉性，时刻警惕各种形形色色的非无产阶级思想的侵袭。只有头脑里公字掌了权，才能巩固我们夺得的党、政、财、文大权。
    破私立公的最强大的思想武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，特别要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，用毛泽东思想这一强大武器，轰垮自己头脑中的资产阶级司令部；大造“私”字的反。真正做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”做一个永远忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命派。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”我们决不辜负毛主席对我们的希望。我们知道，革命胜利的道路是曲折的，历史的考验是严峻的，我们肩负革命的重任，我们一定坚定地跟着我们伟大领袖毛主席，乘风破浪，永远向前。胜利一定属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派！
