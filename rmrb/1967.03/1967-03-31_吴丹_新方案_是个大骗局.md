On March 28, just one week after the conclusion of the U.S. imperialists' plot to escalate the war in Vietnam at the Guam conference, U.N. Secretary-General U Thant proposed a so-called "three-step plan" to resolve the Vietnam War. Prior to this, the Soviet revisionists' representative at the U.N. had engaged in secretive backstage activities with U Thant and Goldberg. On the same day U Thant announced his "new plan," the Johnson administration immediately expressed its welcome, and Rusk praised the "new plan" at a press conference. Anyone with eyes can see that U Thant's so-called "new plan" is a genuine American product, a new big hoax and conspiracy by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to implement the policy of "forcing surrender through war."

U Thant's so-called "new plan" is even worse than his "three-point plan" proposed last year. The first point of his "three-point plan" was to "stop the bombing of North Vietnam." This was to cooperate with the U.S.'s "bombing to lure and force surrender" trick. Now, the first point of U Thant's "new plan" changes "stopping the bombing" to a so-called "complete cessation of hostilities." This is completely to satisfy the new appetite of U.S. imperialism, raising the price even higher.

According to U Thant's "new plan," it is to "hold preliminary talks" and "reopen the Geneva Conference" on the premise of "implementing a complete cessation of hostilities." The core of this "new plan" is the so-called "complete cessation of hostilities." What does U Thant's "complete cessation of hostilities" mean? It is Johnson's "principle of equality" in disguise. Johnson's wishful thinking is: under the condition that the U.S. continues to occupy South Vietnam, to force North Vietnam to stop aiding the people of South Vietnam in their anti-American national salvation war in exchange for the U.S.'s "stopping the bombing" of North Vietnam. U Thant's "new plan" still demands, under the condition that the U.S. continues to occupy South Vietnam, not only that North Vietnam stop aiding the people of South Vietnam in their struggle, but also that the people of South Vietnam stop resisting the U.S. aggressors, in exchange for the U.S.'s "cessation of hostilities." The essence of U Thant's so-called "new plan" is to demand that the Vietnamese people lay down their weapons and stop fighting under the condition that more than 400,000 U.S. aggressors are occupying their territory; it is to demand that the Vietnamese people surrender to the U.S. aggressors under the pressure of U.S. bombs and cannons. This is a great insult to the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people!

The U.S. is the aggressor, and Vietnam is the victim of aggression. The fundamental solution to the Vietnam problem is only one: the U.S. aggressors must get out of Vietnam, not leaving a single one behind. Under the premise that the U.S. aggressors are occupying Vietnamese territory and refusing to leave South Vietnam, any "complete cessation of hostilities," any "holding of preliminary talks," any "reopening of the Geneva Conference," are all hoaxes. No matter whether the U.S. acts alone or with a few of its henchmen, no matter what form of "talks" are held, they are all hoaxes.

The four forms of talks proposed by U Thant, whether the U.S. acts alone or with one of its henchmen, are all the same. No matter what form, they cannot change the essence of the "peace talks" hoax.

Currently, U.S. imperialism is madly escalating the war of aggression according to the guidelines decided at the Guam conference. In South Vietnam, it is speeding up the deployment of troops and launching large-scale attacks on liberated areas. In North Vietnam, it continues to bomb indiscriminately and is taking new "escalation" actions. It is also preparing to expand the war to the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia, and even to China. At the same time U Thant proposed his "new plan," Rusk openly threatened that if the Vietnamese people do not comply, the U.S. will "fulfill our obligations in South Vietnam." U.S. officials are madly shouting to "find a way to destroy the will of North Vietnam." U Thant's proposal of his "new plan" at this time is obviously to help the U.S. aggressors "force surrender through war," and to use the smoke screen of "peace talks" to cover up the Johnson administration's criminal activities of escalating the war in Vietnam.

On March 27, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement, pointing out sternly: at a time when the U.S. is waging aggression against Vietnam and seriously escalating military operations in the two regions of Vietnam, to demand a ceasefire and unconditional talks from both sides is to not distinguish between the aggressor and the victim, to be detached from reality, and to demand that the Vietnamese people accept the conditions of the aggressor. The spokesman once again emphasized that the Vietnam problem has nothing to do with the United Nations; the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam problem in any way.

The United Nations is a tool in the hands of U.S. imperialism. U Thant is a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism. The so-called plans to resolve the Vietnam problem proposed by U Thant several times are all serving U.S. imperialism. The Vietnam problem must be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves, and the United Nations has no right to interfere, nor is it allowed for U Thant to meddle.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their demise."

The Chinese people are determined, together with the Vietnamese people and all the people of the world, to thoroughly smash the big hoax of "peace talks" conspired by the U.S. and the Soviet Union and promoted by U Thant. The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American national salvation war to the end. The heroic Vietnamese people have already achieved great victories in this sacred revolutionary war. As long as they persist, they will surely achieve final victory!

    吴丹“新方案”是个大骗局
    本报评论员
    三月二十八日，也就是美帝国主义策划扩大侵越战争的关岛黑会结束一周之后，联合国秘书长吴丹抛出了所谓解决越南战争问题的“三个步骤”方案。在这之前，苏修驻联合国的代表同吴丹和戈德堡进行了鬼鬼祟祟的幕后活动。在吴丹公布他的“新方案”的同一天，约翰逊政府立即表示欢迎，腊斯克在记者招待会上对“新方案”大肆吹捧。明眼人一下就可以看穿，吴丹的所谓“新方案”，是地地道道的美国货，是美苏合谋推行“以战迫降”的又一个大骗局、大阴谋。
    吴丹的所谓“新方案”，比他去年提出的“三点”方案更坏。他的所谓“三点”方案的第一点，是“停止对北越的轰炸”。这是为了配合美国“停炸诱和”、“以炸迫和”的诡计。现在吴丹“新方案”的第一点，把“停炸”改为所谓“全面停下来的休战”。这完全是为了满足美帝国主义的新胃口，要价更高了。
    按照吴丹的“新方案”，是要在“实行全面停下来的休战”的前提下，“举行初步会谈”，“重开日内瓦会议”。这个“新方案”的核心是所谓“全面休战”。吴丹叫嚷的“全面休战”，是什么意思呢？就是约翰逊的那个“对等原则”的改头换面。约翰逊的如意算盘是：在美国继续霸占越南南方的条件下，迫使越南北方停止援助南方同胞的抗美救国战争，来换取美国“停炸”北方。吴丹的“新方案”，仍然是在美国继续霸占越南南方的条件下，不仅要求越南北方停止援助南方人民的斗争，而且要求越南南方人民也停止对美国侵略者的抵抗，来换取美国的“休战”。吴丹所谓“新方案”的实质，就是要越南人民在四十多万美国侵略军占领着自己国土的情况下，放下武器，停止斗争；就是要越南人民在美国炸弹和大炮的压力下，向美国侵略者屈膝投降。这是对三千一百万英雄的越南人民的极大侮辱！
    美国是侵略者，越南是被侵略者。解决越南问题的最根本的方案只有一个，就是美国侵略者一个不剩地从越南滚出去。在美国侵略者霸占着越南的国土，赖在越南南方不走的前提下，什么“全面休战”，什么“举行初步会谈”，什么“重开日内瓦会议”，统统都是骗局。不管是由美国单独出面，还是再加上几个美国的帮凶走卒，不管举行任何形式的“会谈”，统统都是骗局。
    吴丹提出的所谓“四种会谈的形式”，不管是美国单独出面也好，加上它的这个帮凶或者那个走卒一道出面也好，都是一样的。不论那种形式，都绝不能改变“和谈”骗局的本质。
    目前，美帝国主义正在按照关岛会议决定的方针，疯狂地扩大侵略战争。在越南南方，它加紧调兵遣将，大举进攻解放区。在越南北方，它继续狂轰滥炸，采取新的战争“升级”行动。它还准备把战火扩大到整个印度支那和东南亚，甚至扩大到中国。在吴丹提出“新方案”的同时，腊斯克公然威胁说，如果越南人民不肯就范，美国将“在南越履行我们的义务”。美国官员疯狂地叫嚷，要“设法摧毁北越的意志”。吴丹在这个时候抛出他的“新方案”，显然既是帮助美国侵略者“以战迫降”，又是用“和谈”的烟幕来掩护约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的罪恶活动。
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人三月二十七日发表评论，严正指出：在美国对越南进行侵略的时候，在美国在越南的两个地区进行严重的军事升级的时候，要求双方停火和举行无条件谈判，就是不区别侵略者和被侵略者，就是脱离现实，就是要求越南人民接受侵略者的条件。发言人再一次强调指出：越南问题同联合国没有关系；联合国绝对没有权利以任何方式干涉越南问题。
    联合国是美帝国主义手中的工具。吴丹是美帝国主义的忠实走卒。吴丹几次提出的所谓解决越南问题的方案，都是为美帝国主义效劳的。越南问题必须由越南人民自己来解决，联合国根本无权过问，也绝不允许吴丹插手。
    毛主席指出：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”
    中国人民决心同越南人民和全世界人民一起，彻底粉碎美苏合谋的、由吴丹出面推行的“和谈”大骗局。中国人民坚决支援越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。英雄的越南人民已经在这场神圣的革命战争中取得了伟大的胜利，只要坚持打下去，就一定会取得最后的胜利！
