	Capital's People from All Walks of Life Support the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression for National Salvation
	Telegram

	New China News Agency, March 19th, Beijing - The full text of the telegram from the meeting of the capital's people from all walks of life supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is as follows:

	On this "March 19th" National Anti-U.S. Struggle Day of Vietnam, marking its 17th anniversary, the people of Beijing from all walks of life held a grand meeting to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of the U.S. imperialists' new "escalation" of the war in Vietnam. We firmly support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and extend our fighting greetings to our Vietnamese brothers and sisters!

	Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified its aggression in South Vietnam and has continuously bombed Vietnam Democratic Republic's territory from land, sea, and air, attempting to realize its grand scheme of "fighting for peace" and "bombing for peace." The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has closely coordinated with U.S. imperialism, peddling the "peace talks" fraud and repeatedly fabricating anti-China rumors over the issue of "transit of aid to Vietnam," stirring up trouble between China and Vietnam. The people of the world have seen more clearly the paper tiger face of the U.S. imperialists and the traitorous features of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

	The heroic Vietnamese people are indomitable and cannot be deceived. They fight braver and stronger with each battle. The U.S. aggressors are mired in the quagmire in Vietnam, finding themselves in a dilemma. The situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is excellent. The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Vietnam Democratic Republic recently issued statements reaffirming the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Vietnam Democratic Republic, expressing the Vietnamese people's determination to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors. The Chinese people firmly support this just stance of the Vietnamese people.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the whole world must have courage to dare to fight, unafraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. In that way, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

	The revolutionary people of the whole world stand on the side of the Vietnamese people, supporting the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. We fully endorse the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 5th regarding the new developments in the Vietnamese situation. The Chinese people have made up their minds to make the greatest national sacrifices to firmly support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors.

	The U.S. imperialists will surely be defeated!
	The Vietnamese people will surely be victorious!

    首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会
    通电
    新华社十九日讯　首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会通电，全文如下：
    值此“三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日十七周年的时候，中国首都各界人民隆重集会，愤怒谴责美帝国主义在越南进行的新的战争“升级”的滔天罪行，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，并且向兄弟的越南人民致以战斗的敬礼！
    最近，美帝国主义不断加紧在越南南方的侵略战争，又从陆上、海上和空中连续狂轰滥炸越南民主共和国的领土，妄图实现它“以战迫和”和“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。苏联修正主义领导集团则密切配合美帝国主义四出活动，推销“和谈”骗局，并且一再在“援越物资过境”问题上捏造反华谣言，挑拨中越关系。全世界人民更清楚地看到了美帝国主义色厉内荏的纸老虎面目和苏修领导集团的叛徒嘴脸。
    英雄的越南人民是压不倒，骗不了的。他们越战越勇，越战越强，美国侵略者在越南泥足深陷，进退维谷。越南人民抗美救国战争的形势大好。越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国外交部最近分别发表的声明，重申了越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国的四项主张，表达了越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者的决心。中国人民坚决支持越南人民的这一严正立场。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    全世界革命人民都站在越南人民一边，支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。我们完全拥护我国外交部三月五日就越南局势的新发展发表的声明。中国人民已下定决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持越南人民彻底击败美国侵略者。
    美帝必败！
    越南必胜！
    首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会
                                一九六七年三月十九日于北京
