Chairman Mao issues the call,
Like spring thunder echoing through the sky.
The poor and lower-middle peasants respond in unison,
Their spirits are invigorated, their fighting spirit is high.

Chairman Mao has sent us a letter,
The young revolutionaries pledge their resolve:
To be the vanguard in revolutionary rebellion,
To be the spearhead on the production front.

The commune's fields are picturesque,
Red flags flutter in the wind on every pole.
Thousands upon thousands of people mobilize,
A great spring plowing campaign is launched.

    春耕速写毛主席，发号召，好象春雷响云霄。贫下中农齐响应，精神振奋斗志高。毛主席给咱来了信，年青小将表决心：革命造反当先锋，生产战线作尖兵。公社田野风光好，杆杆红旗迎风飘。千军万马齐出动，掀起春耕大高潮。
