Revolutionary cadres of Hongqi Commune rush to the frontlines of spring plowing production
and vigorously grasp the work of weak spring plowing teams

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are working and struggling to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 29 — The revolutionary cadres of Hongqi Commune in Yushu County, Jilin Province, have earnestly studied the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in the Countryside and All Levels of Cadres" and enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have rushed to the frontlines of spring plowing production and vigorously grasped the work of weak spring plowing teams, which has been welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants and has effectively promoted spring plowing production.

Some time ago, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party in this commune, unwilling to accept their defeat, colluded with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists during the spring plowing season. They attempted to incite some cadres who had made general mistakes to lie down and not work, aiming to sabotage spring plowing production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hongqi Commune promptly exposed the enemies' plot, which gave the broad cadres and masses a profound class education and effectively promoted spring plowing production. Most production teams' spring plowing preparations were done quickly and well. However, there were thirteen production teams in the entire commune where political work was poor, and spring plowing progress was relatively slow.

The commune's leadership team promptly studied this situation and decided to send cadres to the weak spring plowing teams to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp revolution and promote production. However, some cadres who had made general mistakes were afraid that the poor and lower-middle peasants would not trust them and did not want to go. They were also afraid that they would not be able to do a good job in production in the weak spring plowing teams and would not be able to take responsibility. Here, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army supporting spring plowing production discovered this situation. They helped these cadres study the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in the Countryside and All Levels of Cadres" and Chairman Mao's teachings: "We are working and struggling to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do." After studying, everyone's class consciousness was raised. They said: Now is the critical moment for spring plowing production. If we still harbor personal thoughts and are afraid of this and that, it will be a mistake upon a mistake. As long as we emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, go among the masses, and make revolution and do production with the masses, we will definitely gain the trust of the masses. Now the weak spring plowing teams have difficulties, and we should go there to strive for new achievements and build new labor.

After studying, these cadres immediately took action. They brought Mao Zedong's works and luggage and went to the weak spring plowing teams the next day. Together with the comrades from the People's Liberation Army supporting spring plowing production, they helped these production teams establish and improve the leadership team. They studied Mao Zedong's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants and labored together, greatly arousing the production enthusiasm of the community members. The poor and lower-middle peasant community members rushed to the fields early and late, seized the opportunity to prepare for spring plowing, and quickly basically completed all the spring plowing tasks. At present, the attendance rate of community members in the thirteen weak spring plowing teams in this commune has significantly increased, and everywhere is a scene of bustling activity.

    红旗公社革命干部奔赴春耕生产第一线
    狠抓备耕薄弱队的工作
    毛主席教导说：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”
    据新华社长春二十九日电　吉林省榆树县红旗公社的革命干部，认真学习《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，热烈响应毛主席提出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，纷纷奔赴春耕生产第一线，狠抓备耕薄弱队的工作，受到了贫下中农的欢迎，有力地促进了备耕生产。
    前些时候，这个公社党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不甘心他们的失败，在备耕季节到来的时候，勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子，妄图煽动一些犯有一般错误的干部躺倒不干，以达到他们破坏备耕生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。红旗公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部及时揭露了阶级敌人的阴谋，使广大干部和群众受到了一次深刻的阶级教育，有力地促进了备耕生产，大多数生产队的春耕准备工作搞得又快又好。但是，全公社却有十三个生产队由于政治工作差，备耕进展比较缓慢。
    公社领导生产的班子及时地研究了这种情况，决定派干部到备耕薄弱队去依靠贫下中农抓革命，促生产。但是，有些犯一般错误的干部却怕贫下中农不信任，不愿去，又怕到备耕薄弱队去搞不好生产，负不起责任。在这里支援春耕生产的人民解放军同志发现了这种情况，便帮助这些干部，带着这些问题，反复地学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和毛主席的教导：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”经过学习，大家提高了阶级觉悟。他们说：现在是备耕生产的关键时刻，如果还抱着私心，怕这怕那，就是错上加错。只要我们突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚决照毛主席的指示办事，到群众里面去，和群众一起闹革命，一块搞生产，就一定能取得群众的信任。现在备耕薄弱队有困难，我们就应该到那里去，争取立新功，建新劳。
    这些干部在学习以后，马上行动起来。他们带着毛主席著作，带着行李，第二天就赶到备耕薄弱队去，和支援春耕生产的人民解放军同志一起，帮助这些生产队建立和健全领导班子。他们和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，大大激发了社员群众的生产积极性。全队的贫下中农社员纷纷起早贪黑往地里送粪，抓紧备耕，很快就基本上完成了各项备耕工作。目前，这个公社十三个备耕薄弱队的社员出勤率显著提高，到处是一派热气腾腾的景象。
