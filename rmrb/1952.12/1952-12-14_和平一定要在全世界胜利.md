The World Peace Congress has opened in Vienna. This conference, in terms of its scale, its broad representation, and its impact on the world situation, is unprecedented in the history of the peace movement. Hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world are eagerly looking forward to this great conference; the enemies of peace—a handful of warmongers in the United States and their lackeys—cannot but tremble at this conference. Because, this conference will once again expose the true faces of the warmongers before the people of the world, further ingrain the belief that the spirit of consultation must prevail over the use of force in every corner of the world, and thereby greatly enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for the struggle for peace. Undoubtedly, the World Peace Congress will mark a new and significant development in the world peace movement. The great standard-bearer of world peace, the great Stalin, in his recently published brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," clearly pointed out: "The present-day peace movement aims at rousing the masses of the people to fight for the preservation of peace and for the prevention of a new world war. Consequently, its aim is not to overthrow capitalism and establish socialism—it confines itself to the democratic aim of preserving peace." Stalin's scientific exposition profoundly illustrates the nature of the peace movement and its broad prospects, which will have an unparalleled and immense impact on the development of the current world peace movement.

The reason why the current peace movement is only a democratic movement for the preservation of peace, and not a movement for the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of socialism, is that: First, peace is not only in the interests of the people of one country, or of a particular class or social stratum under a particular social system, but is in the common interest of different classes and social strata in all countries, regardless of their social systems, except for the few monopoly capitalists in imperialist countries. Second, different social systems do not preclude peaceful coexistence between the peoples of different countries; peaceful coexistence between two different social systems is entirely possible as long as there is a desire for peace. Third, as for war, it can only bring threats to security and the pain of bloodshed, sacrifice, and destruction to the people living under any social system. Moreover, under present conditions, any major war would affect many countries and carry the risk of escalating into a new world war. Therefore, the current peace movement is bound to be a democratic movement that encompasses the common demands of the vast majority of people in all countries around the world. And it is precisely because of this that this movement is the most massive and far-reaching democratic movement in human history.

The holding of the World Peace Congress clearly embodies the nature and scale of the current peace movement. Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, pointed out in his opening speech to the World Peace Congress: "The people participating in this congress come from very different countries and have very different philosophical, religious, political and social views. What unites these people is an understanding that the joint action of all peaceful forces must be considered, and that together it is possible to discover and determine ways to take these actions." Joliot-Curie continued: "The sole purpose of the initiators of the World Peace Congress is to convene those who cherish their different ways of life, but wish to jointly find ways to solve the various problems that frighten all those who sincerely hope to maintain peace, to gather together for free and effective discussion." Stalin's scientific exposition on the nature of the current peace movement and the clear objectives of the World Peace Congress have thoroughly shattered the warmongers' nonsense that the peace movement is a partisan movement of the Communist Party; the reason why they fabricate such nonsense is simply because they fear the peace movement, and therefore vainly attempt to use this nonsense as an excuse to suppress the peace movement in various countries. But this nonsense and delusion have obviously gone bankrupt and will continue to go bankrupt.

The world peace movement, along the above-mentioned goals, has achieved great success and development. The Stockholm Appeal has been signed by 500 million people, and the declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact for Peace has been signed by more than 600 million people. These facts vividly demonstrate how enthusiastically the peace-loving people of the world support and endorse the peace movement. After the World Peace Council's Special Session in Berlin issued the declaration in July of this year to convene the World Peace Congress, the people of various regions and countries unanimously and enthusiastically responded to this call, actively launching various activities to welcome this great conference. During this period, representatives from 37 countries in the Asian and Pacific regions held the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in Beijing and achieved great success; 15 European countries held the International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question in Berlin; worker representatives from five Nordic countries held the Nordic Workers' Peace Conference; peace representatives from countries in the Middle East and North Africa also recently held a peace conference in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon; the Soviet Union and the people's democracies have all held national conferences for the defense of peace; capitalist countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America, and the people of various countries under the servitude and oppression of the United States, have all strengthened their actions to strive for peace, in order to welcome the World Peace Congress. The world movement to defend peace has therefore been further advanced.

The particularly important significance of the World Peace Congress lies in the fact that this conference will further expand the alliance of different classes and social strata in various countries against war. The declaration convening the World Peace Congress clearly pointed out: "In order to achieve some goals that will be determined jointly by everyone, all people, regardless of their opinions, affiliation, or group, as long as they demand disarmament, security and national independence, freedom to choose their way of life, and easing of international tensions, the World Peace Congress will unite them." Under this correct policy, the World Peace Congress has become a true world people's congress. Supporting and attending this conference are not only activists in the peace movement from various countries around the world, workers, youth, women, and representatives of the broadest peasant class among the masses, but also members of parliament, writers, scientists, doctors, leaders of various parties, leaders of various churches and religions, industrialists and businessmen, and activists from various countries. This situation shows that the foundation of the world peace movement is constantly expanding, and it will encompass all people in the world who cherish peace. The expansion of the foundation of the peace movement means the isolation of the warmongers, and the bankruptcy of the lies and nets of deceit that they use to deceive and harm the masses. This will be a great victory for the cause of peace and democracy.

On the one hand, the broad masses of people in various countries are actively striving for peace; on the other hand, a handful of warmongers are violating the will of the people by continuing and expanding existing wars of aggression and preparing to create new wars of aggression. At present, the wars of aggression in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are still continuing, and every day and every hour people are dying in the war or being innocently slaughtered by the aggressors. This has aroused strong demands for peace from the people of all countries, including the American people, American soldiers in Korea, the families and relatives of American prisoners of war, and the soldiers of various countries who have been sent to the Korean, Vietnamese, and Malayan battlefields and their families and relatives. However, the US government and its lackeys blatantly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to immediately and completely cease hostilities in Korea; after Eisenhower went to Korea to fulfill his promise to "end the Korean War," he not only had no intention of ending the Korean War, but instead consulted the warmonger MacArthur, who has always advocated expanding the war of aggression, for "clear and concrete ways" to solve the Korean War. This is enough to prove how shameful the "peace" in the mouths of the Eisenhower clique and the US government is. At the same time, Adenauer, the US puppet in West Germany, revealed the secret agreement between the United States to arm 500,000 West German troops. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc is scheduled to hold a council meeting in Paris on the 15th of this month, at which the United States will force the so-called North Atlantic countries to step up their arms expansion and preparations for war, and generally increase military spending by 20 percent in 1953.

Continuing and expanding existing wars of aggression and creating new wars of aggression have become tools for a handful of monopoly capitalists in the United States and other imperialist countries to get rich. According to materials published by "U.S. News & World Report" on November 21, the total amount of military appropriations in the United States since the aggression against Korea has reached the huge figure of 181 billion US dollars, and the US military budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in July 1953, will increase further. American monopoly capitalists are stepping up their pursuit of war profits. In 1951, the profits of American capitalists reached 42.9 billion US dollars, thirteen times the pre-war figure of 1938. In 1952, the profits of American capitalists continued to increase. In the third quarter of this year alone, the profits of the six largest aircraft companies in the United States increased by 54.1 percent compared with the same period last year, and the profits of General Electric, Sylvania Electric, and other companies that manufacture atomic weapons and electronic equipment, radio facsimile equipment for military use increased by 126 percent. This insatiable greed of imperialist monopoly capitalists for maximizing profits is the sole and most fundamental cause of world tensions. At the same time, this is the fundamental reason why the people of the United States and many capitalist countries are increasingly falling into poverty and bankruptcy, why various capitalist countries are losing their independence under the pressure of US capital, and why the people of various colonies and dependencies are suffering from ruthless enslavement and constant plunder.

It is precisely because of this that imperialist monopoly capitalists and their servants are extremely afraid of peace and extremely afraid of the peace movement. The governments of the United States, Britain, and other countries have tried to undermine the World Peace Congress and prevent representatives from various countries from attending. However, in today's world where the people of various countries are widely rising up to strive for peace, all roads lead to peace. The successful holding of the Vienna Conference and the fact that the people of various countries have selected broad representatives and successfully arrived at the meeting vividly illustrate this point. Of course, the people of various countries must still make greater efforts to strive for peace, especially the people of the United States and other capitalist countries. Because the governments of these countries continue to violate the will of the people by carrying out wars of aggression in the name of their own people and preparing to create new wars of aggression. This situation requires the people of the United States and other imperialist countries to shoulder their responsibilities and take strong actions to defend peace and force the governments of these countries to abandon and change their war policies. The World Peace Congress will enable representatives of peace-loving people, different classes, and social strata from various countries to consult on specific ways to ease international tensions, and arouse the people of various countries who have not yet actively participated in the peace movement to take action and strengthen the struggle to defend peace. This is an inspiring conference, a conference of unity, and a conference towards a new victory in the cause of peace.

We, the Chinese people, are now beginning to engage in large-scale peaceful construction; we love peace, and peace is in our interests. Therefore, we are willing to support the World Peace Congress with all our efforts and wish it great success.

Peace must triumph throughout the world!

### 和平一定要在全世界胜利

    和平一定要在全世界胜利
    世界人民和平大会在维也纳开幕了。这次会议无论它的规模、它的广泛的代表性和它对世界局势的影响，在和平运动的历史上都是空前的。世界亿万爱好和平的人民都热烈地向往着这次伟大的会议；和平的敌人——美国的一小撮战争贩子和他们的仆从们对于这个会议不能不胆战心惊。因为，这次会议在世界人民面前将再一次揭露战争贩子的真面目，使协商精神必须战胜武力解决的信念更进一步地深入到全世界的每一个角落，并从而将大大提高人民群众为和平而斗争的积极性。无疑的，世界人民和平大会将标志着世界和平运动的新的巨大的发展。世界和平的旗手伟大的斯大林在他的新近发表的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，曾明确指出：“现今的和平运动，其目的是唤起人民群众去为维护和平、防止新的世界大战而斗争。因而，它所抱的目的不是推翻资本主义和建立社会主义，——它只限于为维护和平而斗争的民主目的。”斯大林这一科学的论证，深刻地说明了和平运动的性质及其广大的前途，这对于当前世界和平运动的发展将发生无可比拟的巨大作用。
    当前的和平运动之所以只是为维护和平而斗争的民主运动，而不是推翻资本主义和建立社会主义的运动，是因为：一、和平不只是某一个国家的人民，或者是某一种社会制度下的某一个阶级或社会阶层的利益，而是除了帝国主义国家的少数垄断资本家以外的一切国家的不同的阶级和社会阶层的共同利益，不论这些国家的社会制度如何。二、不同的社会制度并不妨碍各国人民之间的和平共存，只要有和平的意愿，两种不同社会制度之间的和平共存是完全可能的。三、至于战争，则无论对于生活在那一种社会制度下的人民都只能带来对安全的威胁和流血、牺牲以及破坏的痛苦。并且在现今的条件下，任何一个较大的战争，其灾害都要波及到许多国家，并有扩大为新的世界战争的危险。因此，当前的和平运动就必然是包括全世界各国绝大多数人民的共同要求的民主运动。也正因为如此，所以这个运动是人类历史上规模最浩大、范围最广阔的民主运动。
    世界人民和平大会的举行极其清楚地体现了当前和平运动的性质和规模。世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在世界人民和平大会的开幕词中指出：“参加这个大会的人来自极不相同的国家并具有极不相同的哲学、宗教、政治和社会见解。团结这些人民的是这样的一种了解，即：必须考虑一切和平力量的联合行动，大家在一起，就有可能发现并确定采取这些行动的办法。”约里奥—居里并继续指出：“世界人民和平大会发起人的唯一目的就是召集那些珍视其不同的生活方式、但愿共同找出办法来解决那些使一切虔诚地希望维护和平的人们感到惊惧的各项问题的人们，共聚一堂，作自由的、有效的讨论。”斯大林关于当前和平运动的性质的科学论证和世界人民和平大会的明确目的，彻底粉碎了战争贩子们把和平运动说成是共产党党派运动的胡说；他们之所以要捏造这种胡说，只是因为他们害怕和平运动，因此妄想以这种胡说为藉口来镇压各国人民的和平运动。但是这种胡说和妄想显然已经破产并将继续破产。
    世界和平运动沿着上述的目标，已获得了伟大的成就和发展。斯德哥尔摩宣言有五亿人签名，要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言有六亿多人签名，这些事实极其生动地显示出世界爱好和平人民对和平运动是如何热烈地支持和拥护。世界和平理事会柏林特别会议于今年七月发出召开世界人民和平大会的宣言之后，世界各地区以及各国人民一致热烈响应这个号召，积极展开各种活动，迎接这个伟大的会议。在这个期间，亚洲及太平洋区域三十七个国家的代表在北京举行了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并取得了伟大的成就；欧洲的十五个国家在柏林举行了国际争取和平解决德国问题会议；北欧五个国家的工人代表举行了北欧工人和平会议；中近东及北非各国和平代表最近也在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行了和平会议；苏联及人民民主国家都分别举行了全国保卫和平会议；亚洲、欧洲、北美洲和拉丁美洲的资本主义国家和处于美国的奴役和压迫下的各国人民，都以加强争取和平的行动，来迎接世界人民和平大会。世界保卫和平运动已因此而更为向前推进了。
    世界人民和平大会的特别重要的意义，在于这个会议将进一步扩大各国不同阶级和社会阶层的反对战争的联盟。召开世界人民和平大会的宣言中曾明确指出：“为了达到将由大家共同来确定的一些目标，所有的人，不管他们具有什么意见，属于什么派别或团体，只要他们要求裁减军备、安全和民族独立、自由选择他们的生活方式以及缓和国际紧张局势，世界人民和平大会都要把他们团结起来。”在这一个正确的方针之下，世界人民和平大会已成为真正的世界人民大会。支持与出席这个会议的，不仅是世界各国和平运动的积极分子、工人、青年、妇女和人民群众中最广大的农民阶层的代表，并有各国的国会议员、作家、科学家、医生、各种党派的领袖、各种教会和宗教的领袖、工商业人士和运动家等等。这种情形，说明了世界和平运动的基础正在不断地扩大，它将包容世界上一切怀着和平愿望的人们。和平运动基础的扩大，就是战争贩子的孤立，就是他们欺骗和陷害人民群众的谎言的罗网的破产。这将是和平民主事业的巨大胜利。
    一面是各国广大人民积极努力争取和平，一面是一小撮战争贩子违反人民的意愿继续进行和扩大现有的侵略战争，并准备制造新的侵略战争。现在，朝鲜、越南和马来亚的侵略战争还在继续，每天每小时都有人在战争中死去，或遭受侵略者的无辜屠杀。这激起了各国人民，包括美国人民、在朝鲜的美国士兵、美国战俘的家属和亲人，以及那些被送往朝鲜战场、越南战场和马来亚的各国士兵和他们的家属和亲人的强烈的和平要求。但是，美国政府和它的仆从们在联合国大会上悍然拒绝了苏联所提的立即完全停止在朝鲜的敌对行动的建议；艾森豪威尔为了履行他“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言而去了一趟朝鲜之后，他不但毫无结束朝鲜战争之意，相反的却向那个一贯主张扩大侵略战争的战争贩子麦克阿瑟请教起解决朝鲜战争的“明确而具体的办法”来了。这足以证明艾森豪威尔之流以及美国政府口中的“和平”是多末可耻的谎言。与此同时，美国在西德的傀儡阿登纳透露出美国武装五十万西德军队的密约。北大西洋侵略集团已定于本月十五日在巴黎举行理事会，在这个会议上美国将强迫所谓北大西洋国家加紧扩军备战，并在一九五三年普遍增加百分之二十的军事费用。
    继续进行和扩大现有的侵略战争和制造新的侵略战争，已成为美国及其他帝国主义国家少数垄断资本家致富的工具。据“美国新闻与世界报道”十一月二十一日所公布的材料，美国自侵朝战争以来的军事拨款总额已达一千八百一十亿元美金的庞大数字，而一九五三年七月开始的下一个财政年度的美国军事预算还要增加。美国垄断资本家正加紧追求战争利润。一九五一年美国资本家的利润已达四百二十九亿美元，达战前一九三八年的十三倍。一九五二年美国资本家的利润又在继续增加。仅在今年第三季，美国六家最大飞机公司的利润较去年同期又增加了百分之五十四点一，奇异电气公司、西万尼亚电气公司和其他制造原子武器及供军队使用的电子设备、无线电传真设备的公司的利润增加了百分之一百二十六。帝国主义垄断资本家的这种博取最大限度的利润的贪欲，就是世界紧张局势的唯一的和最根本的原因。同时这也就是美国和许多资本主义国家人民日益陷于贫困和破产，各资本主义国家在美国资本的压力下丧失独立，各殖民地附属国人民遭受无情的奴役和不断掠夺的根本原因。
    就是因为如此，所以帝国主义垄断资本家及其奴仆们极端害怕和平，也极端害怕和平运动。美、英等国政府曾力图破坏世界人民和平大会，阻止各国代表赴会。但是，在各国人民广泛地起来争取和平的今天，条条大道都通向着和平。维也纳大会的胜利举行，以及各国人民选派了广泛的代表并顺利到会的情形，就生动地说明了这一点。当然，各国人民还必须以更大的努力来争取和平，尤其是美国及其他资本主义国家的人民。因为这些国家的政府还继续违反着人民的意志，以其本国人民的名义进行着侵略战争，并准备制造新的侵略战争。这种情形，就要求着美国和其他帝国主义国家的人民必须担负起自己的责任，要以强有力的行动来保卫和平，迫使这些国家的政府放弃和改变它们的战争政策。世界人民和平大会将使各国爱好和平的人民、不同的阶级和社会阶层的代表协商出缓和国际局势的具体办法，并唤起那些尚未积极参加到和平运动中来的各国人民行动起来，加强保卫和平的斗争。这是一个鼓舞的大会，团结的大会，走向和平事业的新的胜利的大会。
    我们中国人民正开始进行大规模的和平建设；我们热爱和平，和平是我们的利益。因此，我们愿以一切努力支持世界人民和平大会，并预祝它的伟大成功。
    和平一定要在全世界胜利！
