Editor's Note: In his report to the 19th Congress of the CPSU, Malenkov said: "At present, it is particularly important to develop self-criticism and criticism from below, and to treat those who hinder the development of criticism of our shortcomings, suppress criticism, and allow critics to be persecuted and retaliated against as deadly enemies of the Party, and to wage a merciless struggle against them." Because "facts show that victory has produced complacency, a desire for a life of ease, and a desire to rest on past laurels in the ranks of the Party." The cover painting (by Valik) from the Soviet "Crocodile" magazine, issue 27, 1952, which we reprint here, and the six cartoons (by Yefimov) published in the same issue, vividly expose the ugly faces of various types of suppressors of criticism. These are shadows under the brilliant socialist sunshine, who fear criticism like fire, especially criticism from below. Look: some are thunderous, some shirk responsibility, some play deaf and dumb, some flaunt their seniority..., and their only purpose is to suppress criticism. These portraits are not unfamiliar to us; they can also be found in many of our agencies and organizations. In order to smoothly advance our revolutionary and construction undertakings, we must implement the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Developing Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals," fully promote democracy, extensively mobilize the masses, take up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, and conduct tireless struggle against the new bureaucrats and "painted" communists that Comrade Stalin spoke of, regularly and resolutely.

Crocodile: (To the suppressors of criticism, Party overlords, sloppy workers, and others) "Today's cover doesn't feature you, but I'll be studying you in this issue."

I. The suffocating suppressor of criticism: I will teach them what criticism is! They will cry before me! I will grind them to powder! I will dismiss them "according to personal wishes"!

II. The responsibility-shirking suppressor of criticism: Comrades! I implore those who criticize me not to forget that criticizing me is tantamount to impudently criticizing our leader, Sergei Sidolovich, because everything I do has been approved by him in advance.

III. The deaf-and-dumb suppressor of criticism: Some comrades who spoke just now criticized the shortcomings in my work. I don't think it's necessary to discuss their improper attacks, so I'd like to talk about the next issue...

IV. The paternalistic suppressor of criticism: Comrades Petrov and Fangdolov forgot when criticizing me that I am older than them; they forgot that I was already leading this organization when they were still in school. You should be ashamed, Comrades Petrov and Fangdolov, and other comrades...

V. The proverb-loving suppressor of criticism: No matter whose ox is bellowing, your ox cannot bellow. (Others can criticize, but you are not worthy!) Does an egg want to teach a hen? We'll see who's stronger! They must remember: as you shout, so shall you echo!

VI. The Mayor-type suppressor of criticism from Gogol's works: Hmph! You guys! ... (Stomping the floor viciously) I will deal with these worthless writers in the same way! Bah! You bunch of boring literati! Damned liberals! Bastards! I'll tie you all up and grind you to powder…

    压制批评者群像
    编者按：马林科夫在苏共第十九次代表大会上的报告中说：“目前特别重要的是：展开自我批评与自下而上的批评，把那些阻碍对我们的缺点展开批评、压制批评及听任批评者遭到迫害与报复的人，当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争。”因为“事实表明：胜利已经在党的队伍中产生了自满、太平享福和庸俗自安的情绪，想要高枕无忧地歇一歇，依靠过去的功劳生活一下。”我们转载在这里的苏联“鳄鱼”杂志一九五二年第二十七期的封面画（瓦里克作）和登在同期杂志中的六幅漫画（叶菲莫夫作），把各种类型的压制批评者的嘴脸唯妙唯肖地揭露出来。这是灿烂的社会主义阳光底下的一群影子，他们像害怕火一样地害怕批评，尤其害怕来自下面的批评。看吧：有的大发雷霆，有的推卸责任，有的装聋作哑，有的摆老资格……，而他们的目的只有一个：压制批评。这些肖像对我们并不陌生，在我国许多机关、团体里也可以找到他们。为了顺利推进我们的革命和建设事业，必须贯彻执行中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，充分发扬民主，广泛发动群众，拿起批评与自我批评的武器，经常地、坚决地跟斯大林同志所说的新的官僚主义分子和“涂了漆的”共产党员，进行不倦的斗争。
    鳄鱼：（向压制批评者、党老爷、工作马虎者以及其他人等）“今天的封面上没有你们的地位，在这一期内我要研究你们。”
    一、扼杀式的压制批评者：我要教他们认识什么是批评！他们会在我面前哭泣的！我要把他们磨成粉！我要“按照个人愿望”辞退他们！
    二、推卸责任的压制批评者：同志们！我请求那些批评我的人不要忘记，他们批评我，就等于放肆地批评我们的首长谢尔盖·西道洛维奇，因为我所做的一切，事先都取得了他的同意。
    三、装聋作哑的压制批评者：刚才发言的一些同志批评了我工作中的缺点。我认为没有必要讨论他们的不正当的攻击，因此我想来谈谈下一个问题……
    四、家长式的压制批评者：彼德罗夫同志和方道罗夫同志在批评我的时候，忘记了我比他们年长；忘记了他们还在学校读书的时候，我已经在领导这个机关了。你们真不知羞耻呀，彼德罗夫同志和方道罗夫同志，以及其他同志……
    五、喜用谚语的压制批评者：不管谁的牛叫，你的牛却不能叫。（别人可以批评，但你不配！）鸡蛋想教训母鸡吗？我们且看谁厉害！他们要记住：怎样叫喊，就有怎样的回声！
    六、果戈理作品中的市长型的压制批评者：哼！你们吗！……（恶狠狠地用足顿着地板）我要用同样的方法对付这些一文不值的著作家！呸！你们这班无聊的文人！该死的自由主义者！孽种！我要把你们都绑起来，把你们磨成粉………
