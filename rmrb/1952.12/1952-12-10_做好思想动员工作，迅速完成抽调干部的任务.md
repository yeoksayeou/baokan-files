    Do a Good Job of Ideological Mobilization and Quickly Complete the Task of Transferring Cadres

    Currently, the biggest difficulty in capital construction is the extreme weakness of cadres and technical forces, and the capital construction agencies have not yet been fully established and staffed. If this problem is not solved, "putting capital construction in the primary position" will become empty talk. The main method to solve this problem is, as pointed out at the Capital Construction Conference of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council: actively transfer the most outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers from various production departments to capital construction. Therefore, to examine the leadership cadres at all levels related to industrial production, especially the leadership cadres of various production departments, to see whether they have practically, rather than verbally, recognized the important significance of capital construction, and whether they are conscientiously implementing the central government's instructions, we must see if they are actively transferring capable personnel from their own production departments to capital construction departments.

    The leading cadres of Tangshan Steel Plant are resolute and serious in implementing this instruction from the Central Committee. They have decided to transfer 60% of the existing technical cadres, 50% of the veteran cadres, and 20% of the general business management cadres to the capital construction department. Moreover, they not only guarantee that production work will proceed as usual, but also continue to cultivate reserve forces, preparing to continuously transfer cadres for new construction tasks.

    The method adopted by Tangshan Steel Plant to implement this instruction—emphasizing ideological mobilization work—is also correct. The director of Tangshan Steel Plant accepted the education he received at the Conference of Factory Directors and Mine Managers of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, firmly grasped the method of ideological mobilization, and made all cadres understand the great significance of capital construction. Based on this, the work of cadre transfer was carried out, so their work proceeded relatively smoothly. The experience of Tangshan Steel Plant proves that the key to smoothly completing the task of transferring cadres lies entirely in the leading cadres first deeply recognizing the great significance of capital construction and specifically understanding the principle of "putting capital construction in the primary position," establishing an overall concept, and overcoming departmentalism.

    At present, some departments do not pay enough attention to the necessary ideological mobilization work, so that they have encountered great resistance in implementing the task of transferring cadres. These departments should learn from the practices of Tangshan Steel Plant, and combine the current work of transferring cadres to conduct "make-up lessons." Only by repeatedly explaining to the cadres why it is necessary to strengthen capital construction work, so that all cadres fully recognize its important significance and broaden their horizons, can we gradually overcome and even eliminate resistance such as departmentalism, fear of difficulties, and unwillingness to change careers. And as long as this is done, not only can the work of transferring cadres be completed smoothly, but also after these cadres are transferred to new positions, they will feel the weight of their responsibilities, and they will resolutely study their jobs, overcome difficulties, and complete their tasks.

    做好思想动员工作，迅速完成抽调干部的任务
    目前基本建设中最大的困难是干部和技术力量十分薄弱，基本建设机构还没有完全建立和充实起来。如果这个问题得不到解决，“把基本建设放在首要地位”就将成为空谈。解决这个问题的主要方法，就是中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会基本建设会议上所指出的：积极地从各生产部门中抽调最优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人到基本建设中去。因此，要考察有关工业生产的各级领导干部，首先是各生产部门的领导干部，是否在实际上而不是在口头上认识了基本建设的重要意义，是否认真地执行中央的指示，就看他们是不是积极地从自己的生产部门中抽出得力的人员输送给基本建设部门。
    唐山钢厂的领导干部执行中央的这一指示是坚决的、认真的。他们已确定由现有人员中抽出百分之六十的技术干部、百分之五十的老干部和百分之二十的一般业务管理干部到基本建设部门中去，而且他们不仅保证生产工作照常进行，还要继续培养后备力量，准备给新的建设任务不断输送干部。
    唐山钢厂执行这一指示的方法——重视思想动员工作，也是正确的。唐山钢厂厂长接受了在重工业部厂矿长会议上所得到的教育，紧紧掌握了思想动员这一方法，使全体干部都了解基本建设的重大意义，在这个基础上来进行干部调动的工作，因此他们的工作进行得比较顺利。唐山钢厂的经验证明：要顺利完成抽调干部的任务，其关键完全在于领导干部首先要深刻认识基本建设的重大意义并具体领会“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，树立整体观念，克服本位主义思想。
    现在有些部门对必须进行充分的思想动员工作重视得很不够，以致在执行抽调干部的任务时，遇到了很大的阻力。这些部门应该学习唐山钢厂的做法，结合着目前抽调干部的工作，进行“补课”。只有反复向干部讲清了为什么要加强基本建设工作，使所有的干部都充分认识它的重要意义，打开他们的眼界，才能逐渐克服以至消灭本位主义、惧怕困难、不愿转业等等阻力。而只要这样做了，那末，不仅抽调干部的工作可以顺利地完成，而且这些干部调到新的岗位之后，也才会感到自己责任的重大，才会坚决地去学习业务，克服困难，完成任务。
