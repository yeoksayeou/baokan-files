    Instructions from the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau on Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses

    For several years, leadership organs at all levels have diligently processed many letters from the masses and cadres, resolving many urgent problems for them, and have accumulated experience and created several feasible systems in the long-term work. The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, especially after vigorously handling the typical case of Zhang Shunyou, further improved this work. First, the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses and the masses' awareness and enthusiasm have been enhanced, and the people's letters and visits have increased unprecedentedly, expanding the scope of contact between the Party, the government, and the masses; second, leadership organs at all levels have generally recognized the importance of this work. However, the shortcomings are still serious. In addition to phenomena such as lax systems, backlogs and omissions, perfunctory handling, concealment and shielding, and forwarding without action, many leadership organs and their responsible comrades have not truly recognized the importance of this work, do not pay attention to it ideologically, and lack due supervision, inspection, and leadership for specific work, leaving this work in a state of disorganization and weakness for a long time. This is the root cause of many serious shortcomings. To completely overcome all thoughts and behaviors that do not value this work and to do this work well throughout the region and in all organs, the following instructions are hereby issued.

    (1) Leadership organs and leading comrades at all levels should deeply recognize that handling letters from the people and receiving the masses is an important way for the Party and the People's Government to connect with the masses, and an important aspect for the Party and the People's Government to connect with the people, help the people, and learn from the masses. Therefore, it is an important work that is closely related to the interests of the broad masses of the people, and it is by no means a trivial matter that can be done or not done. Practical experience over the past few years has also proved that the work of handling letters from the masses and receiving the masses is of extreme importance to us: (1) It enables us to timely expose and eliminate various illegal and disciplinary behaviors and bureaucratic elements, thus becoming an important aspect and an important front for us to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy. (2) Due to the letters from the masses, the appearance, dynamics, process, and achievements of past political movements or central work are timely reflected, providing the necessary information, opinions, and suggestions for carrying out and deepening the movement, and sharply exposing deviations in the implementation of policies in the movement, enabling us to enrich the content of the movement and timely correct the deviations that damage the healthy development of the movement, thus closely combining this work with our political movements. (3) The individual problems and certain specific demands reflected in the letters and visits from the masses, many of which are universal and major policy issues or major issues in the work of a region or a certain period, may guide us to fundamentally solve certain major problems, thereby playing a role in promoting overall work. From this, it can be seen that all Party and non-Party cadres, especially leading cadres in Party, government, court, people's supervision organs, people's organizations, military organs, and important enterprises at all levels, should deeply understand the profound and serious significance of this work, and successfully use this method to continuously strengthen contact with the people and improve their work. However, there are still some comrades who do not understand this significance and hold some erroneous views. One view says: This is a "small matter," so the handling is not serious enough. This is completely wrong. They do not understand that our Party, government, and army grew up from the masses of the people and are to relieve the suffering of the people and seek benefits for them. If we do not care about the "small" but urgent demands of the people, serving the people is just empty talk, and we will undoubtedly become detached from the people and lose our meaning of existence. Therefore, seriously handling letters from the masses is one of our important tasks. One view says: We do not have such serious problems as the Zhang Shunyou incident here, and some problems have been solved long ago, so there are no major problems in the letters from the masses, and no typical cases can be found. This view is wrong and can only cover up mistakes, paralyze oneself, and be irresponsible to the people. There is also a view that grasping typical cases and handling them vigorously will have a bad impact and cause trouble. The mistake of this view lies in not understanding that the result of doing so will be to educate cadres and educate the masses, making the people understand that our Party and government are serious in handling affairs and responsible to the people, thus enhancing the prestige of the Party and government and promoting work.

    These erroneous understandings are all hindering the handling of people's letters and receiving the people, and must be criticized and corrected.

    (2) To do a good job in handling letters from the people and receiving the people, the importance of leadership organs at all levels is important, and the Party committee strengthening leadership, constantly caring about and inspecting its situation is the key to strengthening this work. Therefore:

    1. The Party committee and its specialized agency in charge of this work should regularly convene comrades from the same level of various departments and subordinate Party committees in charge of this work to exchange experience, check work, commend the good, and criticize the backward. In short, the Party committee must take various methods to intervene and check the progress of this work, in order to quickly strengthen and do it well.

    2. Party committees at all levels should set up extremely capable specialized agencies (above the provincial Party committee and provincial-level city Party committee) or full-time cadres (prefecture and county Party committees) in the general office (department) to undertake this work and supervise the subordinate organizations' handling of people's letters and receiving the people; the situation of no one in charge must be changed.

    3. Pay close attention to strengthening the organization and work of the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission and the People's Government's People's Supervision Committee and People's Procuratorate. The people's governments or people's supervision committees of all cities and counties should, in accordance with the decision of the State Council, establish at least one people's affairs office or reception room to serve as a public organ for regularly receiving the masses. People's organizations at all levels, military organs above the sub-district level, and large enterprises should, under the principle of not increasing the establishment, have appropriate cadres in charge of this work.

    4. Leaders of the Party and government must strengthen the specific leadership of the above-mentioned departments or cadres, regularly supervise and inspect their work, listen to reports, help overcome difficulties, establish systems, and approve important letters and serious cases. It is wrong to be completely indifferent, to push it away and not care.

    (3) Letters from the masses directly received by Party committees and governments above the county level should, under normal circumstances, be distributed to relevant departments and appropriate subordinate organizations for investigation and handling. If the problem is complicated, serious in nature, or encounters major resistance that cannot be handled by a single department or subordinate organization alone, the Party committee or government should come forward, directly organize, preside over, and resolve it, imitating the method of handling the Zhang Shunyou incident and handling it as a typical case. In view of the fact that there are still many important cases that have not been handled in various places, especially at the prefecture and county levels, one or two typical cases should be selected this winter and vigorously handled during the period of the People's Congress or other appropriate times, on the one hand to educate cadres, and on the other hand to encourage the masses to boldly expose the enthusiasm and courage of bureaucracy and illegal and disciplinary phenomena.

    (4) We must handle letters from the people and receive the people with the most responsible spirit, and earnestly and practically solve the various problems raised by the people. All those that should be resolved and can be resolved must be resolved practically and quickly. For complex problems, although it takes a long time, they should also be completed within a certain period. After handling, the person concerned should be replied to orally or in writing, opinions should be solicited, and if there are any inappropriate places, they should be resolved again. Although some problems should be resolved, but cannot be completely resolved for various reasons, a clear answer should be given and explained. Unreasonable demands should also be patiently explained, pointing out the unreasonable places. Regardless of whether the problem can be solved, the letter writer or visitor must be treated with enthusiasm and care, so that they feel that the Party and the People's Government have unlimited care, love, and responsibility for the people. Those who deliberately exaggerate the facts and spread rumors should be criticized and corrected after investigation. Those individual bad elements who falsely accuse good people should be exposed in an appropriate form, and serious ones should be given due punishment according to the circumstances.

    (5) In order to ensure that the problems raised by the masses are properly handled, all cases with more complicated circumstances should be investigated and studied in depth and detail among the masses in the relevant areas or villages, trusting the masses, fully relying on the masses, and promoting democracy, in order to clarify the facts and correctly handle the problems. All practices that do not rely on the masses, only believe in a few cadres with problems, and listen only to one side of the story will inevitably lead to errors and should be highly vigilant. Of course, under normal circumstances, it is also wrong not to rely on the organization.

    (6) In the investigation and handling, those who suppress the masses, arrange blockades to resist, must be strictly investigated and their punishment aggravated. Those who withhold letters and attempt to shield bad elements should be subject to joint and several punishment. Those who respond passively and do not handle them seriously should be criticized. Those who can actively admit their mistakes and explain the true situation can be given reduced or exempted punishment. After handling, those who are accused or who instruct their relatives and friends to retaliate against the original accusers should be punished according to the severity of the retaliatory behavior. Staff members of Party and government at all levels who turn a blind eye to such retaliatory behavior by lower-level cadres or the masses, fail to resolve it, or even intentionally shield it, should be given appropriate criticism and education or punishment depending on the circumstances.

    (7) All those who are able to unyieldingly and persistently adhere to the spirit of principle, ruthlessly expose bureaucratic errors and illegal and disciplinary phenomena; or who can actively help and provide true information during the investigation and handling by the higher authorities, so that the problems can be handled correctly; or who carry out resolute struggles against those who suppress democracy and shield bad elements and are properly handled, whether they are cadres or the masses, or whether they are Party members or non-Party members, should be rewarded and commended separately.

    (8) The work of handling people's letters and receiving the people is currently the worst at the county level. Many of the masses still do not believe that the county level can solve the problem, and have to run to the provincial and North China-level leadership organs to appeal. In order to effectively and quickly solve the problems of the people and strengthen and improve the leadership of the county Party committee and the county people's government in this work, it is very urgent, and the provincial Party committees and prefectural Party committees should help the county Party committees do this work well.

    (9) Cadres. All cadres in charge of this work must have a certain level of policy, be familiar with the masses, care about the suffering of the people, have a high degree of love for the people, have a solid, patient, meticulous, serious and conscientious, and tireless work style, and should constantly improve their political awareness and increase their knowledge in all aspects, especially familiar with the Party's various policies and the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and familiar with the situation, policies, and problems of the current political movement. This requires an active and tireless spirit of learning. Various leadership organs should be responsible for helping them acquire knowledge in all aspects and cultivating and improving their policy and work level.

    (10) System. In order to ensure that Party and government organs at all levels handle the complaints and accusations made by the people in a timely and accurate manner, prevent errors, and continuously improve their work, there must be a strict system. The "Procedures for Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses" formulated by the General Office of the North China Bureau can be referred to and implemented by Party committees of all provinces and cities, and Party committees of all prefectures and counties.

    The above instructions are expected to be discussed and implemented by Party committees at all levels.

    中共中央华北局关于处理人民来信、接见人民群众工作的指示
    几年以来，各级领导机关已认真处理了很多群众和干部的来信，解决了他们急迫需要解决的许多问题，并在长期工作中积累了经验，创造了若干可行的制度。伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，特别是大张旗鼓地处理了张顺有典型案件后，这个工作有了进一步的改善。一是党和人民政府在群众中的威信以及群众觉悟、群众积极性都提高了，人民来信、来访的空前增多，扩大了党、政府和群众联系的范围；二是各级领导机关比较普遍地认识了这个工作的重要性。但缺点仍然是严重的。除制度不严，积压漏办，草率处理，掩饰包庇，照转应付等现象仍多外，还有不少领导机关及其负责人，并未真正认识这个工作的重要意义，思想上不重视，对具体工作缺乏应有的督促检查和领导，使这个工作长期处于零乱和薄弱的状态。这正是许多严重缺点产生的根源。为彻底克服不重视此项工作的一切思想和行为，在全区范围内和一切机关中做好这个工作，特作如下指示。
    （一）各级领导机关和领导同志，均应深刻认识：处理人民群众来信、接见人民群众的工作，是党和人民政府联系群众的一种重要方式，是党和人民政府联系人民、帮助人民、向人民群众学习的一个重要方面。因此，它是和广大人民群众利益攸关的重要工作，绝不是可以做也可以不做的小事情。从几年来的实际经验中也可以证明，群众来信和接见群众的工作，对于我们有极重要的意义：（1）使我们有可能及时揭发并肃清种种违法乱纪行为和官僚主义分子，从而成为我们开展反对官僚主义斗争的一个重要方面，一条重要战线。（2）由于群众的来信，及时反映了历次政治运动或中心工作的面貌、动态、进程和成就，供给了开展与深入运动所需要的情况、意见和建议，并锐敏地揭露了在运动中执行政策上的偏差，使我们有可能丰富运动的内容并及时纠正损害运动健康发展的偏差，从而使这项工作和我们的政治运动，密切结合起来。（3）群众来信、来访所反映的个别问题和某些具体要求，其中有很多是具有普遍性的重大的政策问题或一个地区、一定时期工作上的主要问题，有可能引导我们去从根本上解决某些重大问题，从而起了推进全盘工作的作用。由此可见，一切党的与非党的干部，特别是各级党、政府、法院、人民监察机关、人民团体、军事机关和重要企业中的领导干部，均应深刻了解此项工作的深邃而严重的意义，并成功地运用这种方式，以不断增强和人民群众的联系，改进自己的工作。但是还有一些同志，不了解这种意义，抱持着若干错误见解。一种意见说：这是“小事情”，因而处理不够认真。这是完全错误的。他们不了解：我们的党、政府和军队是从人民群众中生长起来，并为人民群众解除疾苦、谋求利益的，如果不关心人民群众“细小”的但是迫切的要求，为人民服务就是一句空话，无疑是要脱离人民，而失掉其存在的意义的。因此，认真处理人民群众来信，乃是我们的重要任务之一。一种意见说：我们这里没有像张顺有事件那样严重的问题，有些问题也早解决了，所以群众来信中没什么大问题，也抓不到什么典型。这种见解是错误的，只能掩盖错误，麻痹自己，对人民不负责任。还有一种意见认为抓住典型大张旗鼓的处理，会影响不好，惹出事来。这种意见的错处在于，不了解这样做的结果，是会教育干部、教育人民群众的，使人民了解我们的党和政府是处事严肃，对人民负责的，因而可以提高党和政府的威信，并推进工作。
    这些错误认识，都是妨害处理人民来信和接见人民工作的，必须加以批判和纠正。
    （二）做好处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，重要的是各级领导机关的重视，而党委加强领导，经常关心并检查其情况，则为加强这个工作的关键。因此：
    1、党委及其管理此项工作的专门机构，应定期召集同级各部门和所属下级党委管理此项工作的同志开会，交流经验，检查工作，表扬好的，批评落后的。总之，党委必须采取种种方法干与并检查此项工作的进行状况，以求迅速加强并做好。
    2、各级党委应在办公厅（室）设置极精干的专门机构（省委及省属市委以上）或专职干部（地、县委），以为承办此项工作并督促所属组织关于处理人民来信、接见人民工作的组织；无人管的状况必须改变。
    3、十分注意加强党的纪律检查委员会和人民政府人民监察委员会、人民检察署的组织和工作。各市、县人民政府或人民监察委员会，应按照政务院的决定，最少要建立起一处人民问事处或接待室，以为经常接见群众的公开机关。各级人民团体、分区以上军事机关、大的企业在不增加编制的原则下，都要有适当的干部管理此项工作。
    4、党和政府的领导人必须加强对上述部门或干部的具体领导，定期督促检查他们的工作，听取报告，帮助克服困难，建立制度，批办重要信件和严重的案件。一切不闻不问，推手不管，都是错误的。
    （三）县以上的党委、政府直接接到的人民群众来信，通常情况下，应分交有关部门及下级适当的组织调查处理。问题复杂、性质严重或遇到重大阻力非一个部门或下级组织能够单独处理者，应由党委或政府出面，直接组织、主持和解决，效法处理张顺有事件的方法，作典型处理。鉴于各地，特别是地、县级尚未处理的重要案件仍多，今冬均应选择一、二典型，利用人民代表会议开会期间或其他适当时机，大张旗鼓地进行处理，一方面教育干部，一方面鼓舞群众大胆揭发官僚主义和违法乱纪现象的热情与勇气。
    （四）必须以最负责的精神，处理人民来信，接见人民，并认真切实地解决人民所提出的各项问题。凡应解决而又能够解决者，均须切实迅速解决。问题复杂者，虽需较长时间，亦应在一定期限内处理完毕。处理后均应以口头或书面答复本人，征询意见，如有不适当处，再行解决。某些问题虽应解决，但因种种原因目前尚不能彻底解决者，应明确答复，并进行解释。要求不合理者，亦应予耐心解释，指明不合理的地方。不管问题能否解决，对来信人或来访者，均须热情相待，体贴照顾备至，务使其感到党、人民政府对人民是无限关怀、热爱和负责的。对于故意夸大事实，播弄是非者，查明后应予以批评纠正。个别坏分子诬告好人者，应采取适当形式予以揭发，严重者并应分别情况予以应得之处分。
    （五）为保证处理好群众提出的问题，凡情节较复杂的案件，均应在有关地区或有关村庄的群众中进行深入细致的调查研究，相信群众，充分依靠群众，发扬民主，以弄明实况，正确处理问题。一切不依靠群众，只相信少数有问题的干部，偏听偏信的做法，必会造成错误，应高度警惕。当然，通常情况下，不依靠组织的做法也是不对的。
    （六）在调查处理中，遇有压制群众，布置封锁抵抗者，必须严加追究，加重其处分。扣压来信，企图包庇坏分子者，应受连带处分。消极应付，不认真处理者，应受批评。有错误而能主动承认，并说明真实情况者，可减轻或免予处分。处理后，被控诉者本人或指使其亲朋向原控诉人进行报复者，应视报复行为严重程度，加以惩办。各级党和政府的工作人员，对下级干部或群众此种报复行为听之任之，不予解决，甚至有意包庇者，视情节轻重予以适当的批评教育或处分。
    （七）凡能不屈不挠、坚持原则精神，无情揭发官僚主义错误与违法乱纪现象者；或在上级调查处理时，能够积极帮助，供给真实情况，使能正确处理问题者；或与压制民主，包庇坏分子的人进行坚决斗争，得到恰当处理者，不管是干部和群众，也不管是党员与非党员，均应分别予以奖励和表扬。
    （八）处理人民来信、接见人民的工作，目前以县级为最差。不少群众迄今仍不相信县级可以解决问题，不得不跑到省级和华北级领导机关来申诉。为切实迅速地解决人民群众中的问题，加强和健全县委和县人民政府对此项工作的领导，是十分迫切的，各省委和地委，应帮助县委做好这个工作。
    （九）干部。凡管理此项工作的干部，必须有一定的政策水平，熟悉群众，关心人民群众的疾苦，对人民群众有高度的热爱，有踏实、耐心、细致、严肃认真和不辞辛苦的工作作风，且应不断提高自己的政治觉悟程度，增加各方面的知识，要特别熟悉党的各项政策和人民政府的法令，熟悉当前政治运动的情况、政策和问题。这就要依靠主动的、不倦的学习精神。各个领导机关则应负责帮助他们取得各方面的知识，培养和提高他们的政策与工作水平。
    （十）制度。为保证各级党、政机关及时准确地处理人民来信及人民口头所提出的申诉、控告，防止错误，不断改进工作，必须有一套严密的制度。华北局办公厅所制订的“处理人民来信、接见人民群众工作的程序”，各省、市委和各地委、县委均可参酌执行。
    以上指示望各级党委讨论执行。
        一九五二年十一月
