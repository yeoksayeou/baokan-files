    A Brief Review of Political and Legal Work

    People's Judicial Organs Should Correct Mistakes
    The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government has reversed past wrongful judgments during the judicial reform movement, demonstrating that our highest people's judicial organ is courageous in correcting errors and will rectify any wrongdoing. People's courts at all levels in all regions should learn from this spirit and practice.
    Within our people's judicial organs, there have been many instances of impure organizations and impure ideologies in the past. As a result, there have been a considerable number of wrongly judged and improperly adjudicated cases, which has severely damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. How can we restore this loss? One effective step is to mobilize the masses to expose all improperly handled cases from the past. At the same time, with a spirit of seeking truth from facts, we must re-examine, re-process, and reverse judgments. We must apologize to and console the masses who have been wronged, and endeavor to compensate for the material losses suffered by the masses.
    Some people believe that reversing judgments damages the "prestige" of the court. This is a reactionary old legal concept of "officials never regretting judgments," which must be strictly criticized. The people's judicial organs serve the people. Only by being serious and responsible to the people, and correcting mistakes when they occur, can we establish prestige among the people. People's courts in Shenyang, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and other places have all convened mass meetings to reverse past improperly handled cases. As a result, they have received unanimous praise from the broad masses. The masses said: "We have never heard of a court publicly apologizing to the people for wrongly judged cases. We want to thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." The people's courts in these places have not only not lost prestige as a result, but have become even more loved and trusted by the people. At the meeting in Xi'an City People's Court to reverse three wrongful judgments, eighty-two written opinions and materials from the masses were received, supporting judicial reform and exposing the bad work style of judicial personnel. This shows that publicly reversing judgments can not only restore the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, but is also one of the important methods to further mobilize the masses to do a good job in judicial reform. Therefore, it is wrong to ignore past wrongly judged cases or to find various excuses to delay re-processing. This attitude must be corrected.

### 人民司法机关应该有错就改

    人民司法机关应该有错就改
    中央人民政府最高人民法院在司法改革运动中改判了过去错判的案件，说明我们的最高人民司法机关是勇于纠正错误，有过必改的。各地各级人民法院应当学习这种精神和做法。
    在我们的人民司法机关中，过去存在着许多组织不纯和思想不纯的现象，因此错判和判决不当的案件也为数不少，这使党和人民政府的威信受到严重的损失。怎样挽回这种损失呢？其有效步骤之一，就是发动群众揭发过去一切处理不当的案件，同时用实事求是的精神，重新研究，进行重新处理和改判，对受了冤曲的群众进行道歉和慰问，并设法补偿群众遭受的物质损失。
    有人以为改判案件有损法院的“威信”，这是反动的“官无悔判”的旧法观点，必须加以严格批判。人民的司法机关是为人民服务的，只有对人民严肃负责，有错就改，才能在人民群众中树立威信。沈阳、西安、太原等地人民法院都曾召开群众大会，改判过去处理不当的案件，结果是得到广大群众的同声赞扬。群众说：“自古以来没有听见过法院判错了案还向人民公开道歉，我们要感谢毛主席和共产党。”这些地方的人民法院不仅没有因此失掉威信，反而更为人民所爱戴和信任了。西安市人民法院在改判三个错判案件的大会上，收到八十二份群众写来的拥护司法改革和揭发司法人员坏作风的意见和材料，说明公开改判不仅可以挽回党和人民政府的威信，而且是进一步发动群众作好司法改革工作的重要方法之一。所以，对过去错判的案件采取置之不理或找寻种种藉口拖延不作重新处理的态度，都是错误的，必须加以纠正。
