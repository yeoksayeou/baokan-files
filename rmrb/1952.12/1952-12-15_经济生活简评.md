    Economic Life Brief Comments

    Promote the Experience of Implementing Economic Accounting Systems in Trade Warehouses in Tianjin and Other Places

    With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in commodity turnover in the state-owned trade system, the rational use of warehouses is becoming increasingly important. Generally speaking, the state-owned trade system does not have sufficient warehouses. Moreover, the allocation and use of existing warehouses in various places are not entirely reasonable: mismanagement, waste of warehouse capacity, stockpiling of materials, and damage to materials are still extremely serious. To eliminate these serious chaotic phenomena and improve the utilization rate of existing warehouses, it is necessary to strengthen warehouse management and implement an economic accounting system for warehouses.

    To implement the economic accounting system for warehouses, it is necessary to measure the area of the warehouses, stipulate various quotas, improve management methods, increase work efficiency, increase storage quantity, reduce losses, and save costs. The state-owned trade systems in Tianjin, Wuhan, and other cities have achieved certain results and experience in the process of piloting the economic accounting system for warehouses, which deserves attention from all regions.

    The biggest obstacles to implementing the economic accounting system for warehouses are conservative thinking and departmentalism. Cadres with conservative thinking often think they "know what's going on" and do not conduct measurements and calculations, do not implement quota management, and do not try to improve warehouse utilization. In fact, they simply do not know how big the warehouse is or how much it can hold. They only blindly shout "shortage of warehouses" and ask the higher authorities to build more warehouses. Cadres with departmentalist thinking are unwilling to hand over warehouses for centralized use. They want warehouses during the peak season and would rather leave them empty in the off-season. Obviously, this phenomenon cannot be allowed, and these ideas must be corrected.

    In order to overcome conservative thinking and departmentalism and implement the economic accounting system for warehouses, the experience of Tianjin and other places proves that it is necessary to follow the mass line. That is, repeatedly explain the policy to the masses of workers and staff, expose the shortcomings in previous work, and educate the masses by carefully calculating accounts, so that they understand the importance of implementing the economic accounting system for warehouses. Leading cadres must closely rely on the masses, give play to the wisdom of the masses, improve business technology, propose specific measures, and solve the difficulties in the work in a timely manner, so as to make the work proceed smoothly.

    Starting next year, state-owned trade system warehouses across the country will fully implement the economic accounting system. Relevant departments in various regions should learn from existing experience, make preparations, and meet this important task.

    It is necessary to attach importance to the trial production of new products

    Strengthening the trial production of new products is an indispensable and important part of our country's large-scale economic construction.

    We are going to build many new factories and mines, and renovate many old factories and mines. These factories and mines must be equipped with new machinery and equipment. Some of the equipment is ordered from abroad, but most of it is manufactured by ourselves. The quality of these machines and equipment directly affects the future production level and determines the speed of our country's industrialization. At the same time, even the industrial sectors that produce consumer goods, due to the increasing living standards of the vast urban and rural people, must produce a variety of high-quality products to meet the needs of the people.

    How can we manufacture high-quality new products? This requires attention to many issues, one of which is the importance of trial production of new products. Because we need a large variety of new products, most of which are manufactured according to advanced Soviet standards. However, our existing technical capabilities and equipment capabilities are very inadequate. If we do not actively mobilize and organize technical personnel and workers to learn advanced Soviet technology and personally master the trial production work, it will be difficult to guarantee the quality of new products.

    In the past three years, China's working class has learned and adopted advanced Soviet science and technology, demonstrated a high degree of creativity, overcome many difficulties, and successfully completed the trial production and manufacturing tasks of many new products. However, there are still two erroneous tendencies that must be opposed. One is the conservative thinking of some enterprise leaders. They oppose the trial production of new products to normal production, believing that the trial production of new products will hinder the completion of production tasks, or emphasize that there are too many difficulties in the trial production of new products, and it is easier to produce old products. Another tendency is to ignore the complexity of manufacturing new products, and blindly produce them in large quantities without trial production, causing great losses to the country. Both of these tendencies are detrimental to the country's economic development.

    Experience proves that the trial production of new products is a decisive step in manufacturing new products in large quantities. Through trial production, it is possible to cultivate the design and manufacturing capabilities of new products, accumulate experience in production management and technical management, and improve the technical level of workers, thereby preparing various conditions for mass manufacturing. The experience of Shenyang 321 Factory shows that as long as the leading cadres of the enterprise truly attach importance to and personally organize the trial production of new products, it is possible to overcome difficulties and complete the manufacturing tasks. We should learn from the experience of 321 Factory, strengthen the leadership of new product manufacturing, and manufacture more and better new products to meet the needs of large-scale construction.

    经济生活简评
    推广天津等地试行贸易仓库经济核算制的经验
    随着工农业生产的发展，国营贸易系统商品流转额的增加，合理运用仓库的问题是越来越重要了。目前国营贸易系统的仓库，一般说来是不充裕的。而各地对于现有仓库的分配和使用，又不尽合理：管理不善，浪费仓容量，积压物资，损坏物资的现象，还异常严重。为了消除这些严重的混乱现象，提高现有仓库的使用率，必须加强仓库管理，实行仓库经济核算制。
    为了实行仓库经济核算制，必须丈量仓库的面积，规定各种定额，改善管理方法，提高工作效率，增加保管数量，减少损耗，节省费用。天津、武汉等城市的国营贸易系统在试行仓库经济核算制的过程中，已获得一定的成绩和经验，值得各地加以重视。
    实行仓库经济核算制的最大阻碍是保守思想和本位主义。有保守思想的干部往往自以为“心中有数”，不进行丈量计算，不实行定额管理，不设法提高仓库使用率。实际上，他们根本不知道仓库究竟有多大，到底能装多少东西，他们只是盲目地叫喊“缺仓”，要求上级增修仓库。有本位主义思想的干部不愿把仓库交出来集中使用，他们在经营旺季要仓库，在淡季宁愿让仓库空着，显然，这种现象是不能允许的，这些思想必须加以纠正。
    为了克服保守思想和本位主义，贯彻实行仓库经济核算制，天津等地的经验证明，必须要走群众路线。这就是向职工群众反复交代政策，揭发以往工作中的缺点，用算细账的方法来教育群众，使他们了解实行仓库经济核算制的重要意义。领导干部要紧密地依靠群众，发挥群众的智慧，改进业务技术，提出具体办法，及时解决工作中的困难，以便使工作顺利开展起来。
    从明年开始，全国国营贸易系统仓库将全部实行经济核算制，各地有关部门应该吸取已有的经验，做好准备工作，迎接这一重要的任务。
    必须重视新产品试制工作
    加强新产品的试制工作，是我们国家大规模经济建设中的不可缺少的一个重要环节。
    我们将要建立许多新厂矿，改建很多旧厂矿，这些厂矿都必须装备新式的机器设备。一部分设备是靠国外订货，但大部分还是靠我们自己制造。这些机器设备质量的好坏直接影响今后的生产水平，决定我们国家工业化的速度。同时，即使是生产消费资料的工业部门，也由于广大城乡人民的生活水平日益提高，必须生产多种多样的品质优良的产品才能满足人民的需要。
    怎样才能制造出品质优良的新产品呢，这就需要注意很多问题，其中一个问题，就是必须重视新产品的试制工作。因为我们需要的新产品的品种很多，其中绝大部分都是按照先进的苏联的标准来制造的。而我们现有的技术能力和设备能力又都很不够，如果不积极地动员与组织技术人员、工人学习苏联先进技术，并亲自掌握试制工作，就很难保证新产品的质量。
    三年来，我国工人阶级学习和采用了苏联先进科学技术，发挥了高度的创造能力，克服了很多困难，胜利完成了很多新产品的试制和制造任务。但是，至今也还有两种错误的倾向必须反对。一种是有些企业领导干部的保守思想。他们把试制新产品与正常生产对立起来，认为试制新产品会妨碍完成生产任务，或强调试制新产品的困难太多，不如生产旧产品便当。另一种倾向是忽视新产品制造的复杂性，不经过试制就盲目大量生产，给国家造成很大的损失。这两种倾向，都不利于国家经济的发展。
    经验证明，新产品的试制工作，是对大量制造新产品有决定性的步骤。通过试制可以培养新产品的设计能力和制造能力，积累生产管理和技术管理的经验，提高工人技术水平，为大量制造准备了各种条件。沈阳三二一工厂的经验说明了，只要企业的领导干部真正重视并亲自组织新产品的试制工作，是可以克服困难完成制造任务的。我们应该学习三二一工厂的经验，加强新产品制造的领导，制造更多更好的新产品，以适应大规模建设的需要。
