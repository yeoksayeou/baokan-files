    Several Questions Regarding the Calculation of Agricultural Population
    Question: Can students receiving People's Assistance Grants be counted as agricultural population in their homes?
    Answer: The "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Central People's Government in 1950 stipulates: "The calculation of agricultural population shall be based on the actual agricultural population of the farming household when the agricultural tax register is created. Those whose main source of livelihood is not agricultural income may not be counted; however, revolutionary soldiers and personnel on the supply system may be included in the agricultural population of their families…" College students receiving People's Assistance Grants, whose food and lodging are provided by the school, are not primarily dependent on agricultural income, and generally should not be counted as agricultural population in their homes. However, the above are general regulations, and local areas have some supplementary regulations based on their specific circumstances. Also, because the amount of assistance grants for college students varies, and there are also half-publicly funded treatments in secondary schools, this issue must be handled in accordance with the specific regulations of the local People's Government.
    Question: If a cadre on the supply system is transferred to study at a university, can the tax exemption quota still be deducted at home?
    Answer: If a cadre on the supply system is transferred to study at a university, this is considered in-service training. Those who originally deducted the tax exemption quota at home can continue to deduct the tax exemption quota at home.
    Question: After a male and female cadre on the supply system get married, where should the female's tax exemption quota be deducted?
    Answer: After a male and female cadre on the supply system get married, the female's tax exemption quota should be deducted at the husband's or mother's home according to the female's own wishes; and the local People's Government should be formally notified by her work unit. Without formal notification, it may be deducted at the husband's home according to custom.

    关于计算农业人口中的几个问题
    问：享受人民助学金待遇的学生，是否能在家中计算农业人口？
    答：一九五○年中央人民政府公布的“新解放区农业税暂行条例”规定：“农业人口的计算，按填造农业税清册时农户的实有农业人口计。其不以农业收入为主要生活来源者，得不计；但革命军人和供给制工作人员，得在其家计入农业人口。……”高等学校学生享受人民助学金待遇，膳宿由校方供给，非以农业收入为主要生活来源，一般不得在本人家中计算农业人口。但上述系一般性的规定，各地根据当地具体情况，还有若干补充规定；同时因高等学校学生的助学金有多有少，中等学校中还有半公费待遇，因此，对这一问题，须依当地人民政府的具体规定办理。
    问：供给制干部被调到高等学校学习时，是否能在家中扣除免税额？
    答：供给制干部被调到高等学校学习，系属于在职干部调训性质。原在家扣除免税额者，可以继续在家扣除免税额。
    问：供给制男女干部结婚后，女方的免税额应在何方扣除？
    答：供给制男女干部结婚后，女方的免税额，应依照女方本人的意见，在夫家或母家扣除；并应由其服务机关正式通知当地人民政府。无正式通知者，得依习惯在夫家扣除。
