    Building a Highway on the "Roof of the World"
    —On the Opening of the Kangding to Qamdo Section of the Kangzang Highway
    The Kangzang Highway, linking the interior of the motherland and the border of Tibet, has stretched westward from the Mani Gango grassland in Yulong County, northern Xikang, to Qamdo! This is a brilliant achievement of the great people of the motherland conquering nature tenaciously on the "Roof of the World."
    The Kangzang Highway, from the Mani Gango grassland to Qamdo, is 446 kilometers and 450 meters long. It passes through six major snow-capped mountains with altitudes ranging from 4,500 meters to 5,000 meters. The lowest route is also above 3,300 meters above sea level. Eighty kilometers of this section crawl in the clouds and on the snow line, and more than 150 bridges are erected over the cliffs, deep valleys, and turbulent rapids of the upper reaches of the Jinsha River and the Lancang River.
    Along this route, as far as the eye can see, are stone mountains, and there are many humid swampy areas with soft soil, making it extremely difficult to open mountains and build roads. However, the motherland needs this highway, and the Tibetan people living on the Kangzang Plateau are even more eager for this highway. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent people to the troops and workers building roads on the plateau, bringing them words of care and encouragement, bringing the road builders unshakable confidence and courage.
    In order to resolutely implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the military workers, civilian workers, and engineering personnel participating in the road construction carried forward a high degree of hard work. In order to survey a perfect route in the mountainous plateau, the engineering personnel repeatedly climbed every mountain peak, or carried out design and mapping work along the cliffs and canyons on both sides of the river. When they encountered uninhabited areas, they slept in caves or on grasslands. The rear service troops of the Tibet-bound troops, with the fine traditions and patriotism of the People's Army, have been undertaking arduous and heavy road construction tasks for three years since the day they entered Tibet. They repaired the abandoned and collapsed Sichuan-Xikang Highway and Kangqing Highway, and then came to build the Kangzang Highway. They love the motherland and the Tibetan people. They are determined to "carry the highway forward" and quickly bring happiness and prosperity to the Tibetan people. Thousands of civilian workers, mostly from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, gained road construction experience on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and投入themselves into this great road construction project on the Kangzang Plateau. The military workers and civilian workers united as one, encouraged each other, and overcame various difficulties in the natural environment. The plateau climate is very cold. Local proverbs say:
    "In the first, second, and third months, the snow seals the mountains; in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the mud covers the feet; in the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it is good to walk; in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, the skin cracks." The route is sparsely populated, and there are even 400 kilometers without inhabitants. The military workers and civilian workers slept for many years on wet ground or snow covered ground padded with branches and stones. Heavy snow constantly crushed the tents. There is no water in the high mountains, so they melted snow to cook. When food supplies were difficult, they climbed over high mountains to carry grain themselves, even eating thin porridge, tsampa paste, and wild vegetables, and still insisted on working. In the cold climate of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, under the attack of rain, snow, hail, they kept digging and blasting, regardless of the cracks and bleeding on their hands. There was no place to stand on the cliffs, so they set up scaffolding or used ropes to hold their waists, suspended in mid-air, and still drilled holes and blasted. In the most intense construction days, the entire mountain was engaged in fierce "artillery battles." In their work, they not only overcame many difficulties, but also displayed a high degree of creativity. Each unit came up with 20 or 30 new inventions and creations. The "Flying Swallow" earth-moving method created by soldier Cao Xi increased work efficiency by more than ten times. During the road construction process, the actual work efficiency of the military workers (calculated based on the actual number of people participating in the work) increased by an average of three times, and the actual work efficiency of the civilian workers also increased by 50%.
    All the materials needed for road construction had to be transported from the distant interior. In order to supply grain, fodder, materials, and the necessities of the road construction troops and workers in a timely and full manner, a huge motor vehicle transportation team traveled day and night on the plateau. During the rush transportation days, the drivers only slept for three or four hours a day, washing their faces with cold water when they were sleepy; if they really couldn't support it, they slept wherever they went, and their coats were their quilts. During the rush transportation from Kangding to Ganzi last winter, the Zheduo Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, was closed by snow, and the drivers continued to advance, digging snow higher than the wheels. In order to send the materials to the front as soon as possible, the road was built there, and the cars immediately passed there. The drivers struggled with the mud and gravel on the new route, advancing arduously.
    The Kangzang Highway is the Tibetan people's own highway. In order to welcome the arrival of happy and prosperous days, the Tibetan people in various places along the highway organized tens of thousands of yaks to transport a large number of materials to the construction site. During transportation, the Tibetan people cherished state materials as they cherished their own things. If the sacks were broken, they brought their own needles and threads to sew them up. On rainy and snowy days, they covered the materials with their own pulu. The Tusi of Lado Zong (County), Xirao Senggen, in addition to completing his own transportation tasks, took 1,200 yaks across the border to other Zong (County) to undertake transportation tasks. The Tibetan people of various Zong (County) in the Qamdo area more enthusiastically organized "Tibetan Civilian Worker Detachments," and hundreds and thousands of Tibetan civilian workers participated in the road construction.
    On November 20, the Kangding to Qamdo section of the Kangzang Highway was opened to traffic, and a large convoy of cars drove into Qamdo. The cheers of tens of thousands of people in the streets shook the snow-capped mountains and grasslands of the plateau. People scrambled to surround the convoy, offering flowers and hadas. Children climbed into the cars, asking the uncles who drove the cars to take them away. Young people ran to the hills to look, wanting to see how many cars Chairman Mao had sent them. The motorcade sent by Chairman Mao stretched for more than fifty li, and one could not see the end at a glance. The front had already reached Sichuan Dam, and the rear was still at the top of the Damala Mountain, which is 5,000 meters above sea level. Elderly herder Chi Liang knelt on the ground according to Tibetan customs, clasped his hands together, and thanked Chairman Mao. He said: "We herders have long hoped that Chairman Mao would send cars to transport tea and cloth from the interior, so that we can drink tea happily and exchange old sheepskin coats for new cloth ones. Now they have really come!"
    Qamdo is the economic center of western Xikang, and its surroundings produce about six million pounds of wool and a large amount of medicinal materials and animal skins every year. Trade between the interior and Tibet is also carried out here. However, in the past, transportation was inconvenient, and the only means of transportation between the interior and Yunnan, Tibet, and Qinghai was the slow-moving yak. It took fifty days for a yak to travel from Qamdo to Kangding. During the season when the mountains are blocked by heavy snow, transportation is paralyzed. The Tibetan people need tea and cloth supplied by the interior, but the amount that can be transported in is small and the price is expensive. The local products and specialties, which account for the main income of the Tibetan people's lives, cannot be sold domestically due to transportation difficulties. In the decades before liberation, the economic forces of imperialism invaded the Kangzang area to plunder the wealth of the Tibetan people. They could use a small amount of wool to seize one hundred catties of wool. The Tibetan people said: "This is using the Tibetan people's oil to fry the Tibetan people's bones!" This plunder impoverished the Tibetan people, and the production of local products dropped sharply. The fragile Qamdo handicraft industry was almost completely destroyed! The original forty or so leather shops in Qamdo were reduced to just over ten before liberation, and they were all dying. In the two years since liberation, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, Qamdo's industry and commerce have begun to embark on the road to prosperity. Various handicrafts have resumed and expanded production. Many merchants have moved the goods on the stalls to the counters. In the past two years, the number of private mobile vendors has increased nine times compared with before liberation, and the number of seated merchants has increased by 20%. However, Qamdo is surrounded by high mountains, transportation is very difficult, local products and specialties cannot be sold in large quantities to the interior, and the daily necessities from the interior cannot meet the needs of the people. The opening of the Kangzang Highway to Qamdo has created very favorable conditions for the development of Qamdo's industry and commerce.
    In order to welcome the new prosperity after the opening of traffic, the first materials exchange conference in the Qamdo area will open soon. Tusi, headmen, and business people from various places have gathered in Qamdo to discuss the issue of materials exchange in the entire region. The people of the 39 ethnic groups in the area north of Qamdo, which produces three million pounds of wool annually, have transported 80,000 to 90,000 pounds of wool accumulated over the years to Qamdo. The Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee is helping the people of various regions and townships establish cooperatives. The state-owned trading company's 100,000 packages of tea and a large number of goods such as silk and hadas are being transported from the newly built highway. The trading company is also preparing to organize ten trade groups to go to agricultural and pastoral areas to supply a large number of daily necessities to farmers and herdsmen through local cooperatives. Merchants are also raising funds to purchase local products. Before the opening of traffic to Qamdo, the tea retail department of the trading company reduced the price of tea by a quarter. The doors of state-owned stores and cooperatives are crowded with customers every day before opening hours.
    This thriving scene is just the beginning. After the entire Kangzang Highway is opened to traffic, Qamdo will become more prosperous, and the lives of the Tibetan people will become better and better. Now what is being transported from the interior are the daily necessities of the Tibetan people. In the future, cars can also transport light machinery to build factories in Qamdo. The technicians and workers who are assisting the Tibetan people in building a new Qamdo have arrived one after another, and have already built many stone factories and brick and tile factories. Before the end of this year, it is planned to build more than 1,000 square meters of houses. Larger-scale construction will begin next year, and the total construction area of Qamdo next year will reach 50,000 square meters. These buildings include a fully equipped hospital with 250 beds, a reasonably sized veterinary hospital, and a people's auditorium.
    The opening of the Kangzang Highway to Qamdo has filled the hearts of the vast Tibetan people with boundless excitement and joy, welcoming the rapidly approaching good days. (Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhao Shenying and Yuan Chuanfang)

    把公路修上“世界屋脊”
    ——记康藏公路康定至昌都段通车
    联贯着祖国内地和西藏边陲的康藏公路，从西康北部玉隆县的马尼根果草地出发，向西方已伸展到昌都了！这是伟大的祖国人民在“世界屋脊”上顽强地征服自然的辉煌成就。
    康藏公路从马尼根果草地到昌都这一段，共长四百四十六公里零四百五十公尺，中间经过六座拔海四千五百公尺到五千公尺的大雪山，最低线路也在拔海三千三百公尺以上。这一段，有八十公里的路程爬行在云层里和雪线上，有一百五十多座桥梁架在金沙江、澜沧江上游的悬崖深谷、惊湍急流上。
    在这条线路上，一望无际，都是石山，还有很多潮湿的沼泽地带，土质松软，因此开山筑路十分困难。但是，祖国需要这条公路，居住在康藏高原上的藏族人民更渴望着这条公路。毛主席和朱总司令派人给高原上筑路的部队和工人送来了关怀和鼓舞的题词，给筑路的人们带来了不可动摇的信心和勇气。
    为了坚决执行毛主席和朱总司令的指示，参加筑路的军工、民工和工程人员们发扬了高度的坚苦奋斗精神。工程人员们为了在山峦密布的高原上勘测出一条完美的路线，曾三番五次地翻越每一个山峰，或沿着河流两岸的悬崖和峡谷进行设计、绘图工作，遇到没有人烟的地方，他们就睡在山洞里或草地上。具有人民军队优良传统和爱国主义精神的进藏部队的后方部队，从开始进藏的那一天起，三年来就一直担任着艰巨而繁重的筑路任务。他们修复荒废塌陷的川康公路、康青公路，接着又来修筑康藏公路。他们热爱祖国，热爱藏族人民，他们决心“背着公路前进”，迅速把幸福繁荣带给藏族人民。成千成万的民工们，大部来自成渝铁路上，他们在成渝铁路上取得了筑路的经验，来到康藏高原上又投入了这一伟大的筑路工程。军工们和民工们团结一致，互相鼓励，克服着自然环境的种种困难。高原气候十分寒冷。当地流行的谚语说：
    “正二三，雪封山；四五六，泥没足；七八九，正好走；十冬腊，皮开拆。”沿线又是人烟稀少，甚至有四百公里没有人烟的。军工们和民工们就长年睡在垫上树枝和石头的湿地上或者雪地上。大雪不断地把帐篷压倒。高山上没有水，他们就化雪水煮饭。粮食供给困难的时候，他们爬过高山自己背粮，甚至吃稀饭，吃糌粑糊糊，吃野菜，还照常坚持工作。他们在零下二、三十度的寒冷气候中，在雨雪冰雹的袭击下，不停地进行挖土和爆炸，手上冻裂了口，流出了血，也不顾惜。悬崖绝壁上没有下脚的地方，他们就搭起架子或者用绳子拦住腰，悬在半空中，照样打眼爆炸。在最紧张的施工日子里，整个山头都进行着激烈的“炮战”。他们在工作中，不仅克服了重重困难，还发挥了高度的创造性，各单位出现了二、三十种新发明和新创造。战士曹喜创造的“飞燕”排土法，曾使工作效率提高了十几倍。在筑路过程中，军工们的实际工作效率
    （按实际参加工作的人数来算）平均提高三倍，民工们的实际工作效率也提高百分之五十。
    修筑公路所需的一切物资，都须从遥远的内地运来。为了及时地充分地供应粮秣、材料以及筑路部队和工人们的必需品，巨大的汽车运输队伍日夜不停地在高原上来往。驾驶员们在抢运的日子里，每天只睡三四个小时，瞌睡了用冷水洗脸；实在不能支持了，走到那里就睡到那里，大衣就是他们的被子。在去年冬季从康定向甘孜抢运的期间内，拔海四千多公尺的折多山上被雪封闭，驾驶员们就挖着比车轮还高的积雪继续前进。为了把物资送到最前面，公路修到那里，汽车就立即通到那里。驾驶员们和新路线上的泥泞、碎石搏斗，艰难地前进。
    康藏公路是藏族人民自己的公路。为了迎接幸福繁荣的日子到来，公路沿线各地的藏民组织了上万头的牦牛，把大批物资送到工地。在运输中，藏民像爱护自己的东西一样地爱护国家物资。麻袋破了，他们自带针线缝好，下雨落雪天，他们用自己的氆氇盖在物资上面。拉多宗（县）土司喜饶生根除完成自己的运输任务外，并以一千二百头牦牛越界到其他宗（县）担任运输任务。昌都地区各宗（县）藏族人民更踊跃组织“藏族民工大队”，成百成千的藏族民工参加了修路。
    十一月二十日，康藏公路康定至昌都段通车了，大队汽车开进了昌都。街道上成万人群的欢呼声，震动着高原的雪山草谷。人们争着把车队包围起来，送上鲜花和哈达。孩子们爬上车子，要求开汽车的叔叔们带他们走。年青人跑到山岗上去张望，他们想看看毛主席给他们派来多少汽车。毛主席派来的汽车队拖长五十多里，一眼望不到头。先头已经到了四川坝，后尾还在拔海五千公尺的达马拉山的顶峰。老年牧民迟良按照藏族的风俗，跪在地上，拱合起双手，感谢毛主席。他说：“我们牧民早就盼望毛主席派汽车把内地的茶和布运来，让我们痛痛快快地喝点茶，用新布面儿换换老羊皮袄。现在真的来了！”
    昌都是西康西部的经济中心，它的周围每年出产六百万磅左右的羊毛和大宗药材、兽皮等土产特产。内地和西藏间的贸易也在这里进行。但是过去交通不便，与内地和云南、西藏、青海间交往的唯一交通工具是行动缓慢的牦牛。从昌都到康定，牦牛走一趟就要五十天。在大雪封山的季节里，交通就陷于停顿。藏族人民需要内地供给的茶和布，能运进来的数量微小，价格昂贵。占藏民生活中主要收入的土产特产，也由于运输困难而无法内销。解放前的几十年，帝国主义的经济势力侵入康藏地区掠夺藏族人民的财富，他们用少量毛呢就可以夺去一百斤羊毛。藏民说：“这是用藏民的油炸藏民的骨头！”这种掠夺使藏民陷于贫困，土产急剧减产，脆弱的昌都手工业，几乎全部被摧垮了！昌都原有的四十多家皮作店，到解放前只剩下十多家，并且都是奄奄一息。解放两年来，昌都工商业在国营经济的领导下，已开始走上了繁荣的道路。各种手工业已经恢复并扩大了生产。许多商户把地摊上的货物搬上了柜台。两年来，私营流动商贩比解放前增加了九倍，座商增加了百分之二十。但是，昌都处于高山环抱之中，交通很困难，土产特产不能大量销往内地，从内地来的生活用品，也不能满足人民的需要。康藏公路通车昌都后，替昌都工商业的发展创造了非常有利的条件。
    为了迎接通车后新的繁荣，昌都地区第一届物资交流大会就要在最近开幕。各地土司、头人和工商业界人士已经集合到昌都，商讨全区物资交流问题。昌都以北年产羊毛三百万磅的三十九族地区的人民，已把积存多年的八九万磅羊毛运来昌都。昌都地区人民解放委员会正在帮助各地区乡人民建立合作社。国营贸易公司的十万包茶叶和绸子、哈达等大批货物正从新筑的公路上源源运来。贸易公司并准备组织十个贸易组到农牧区，通过各地的合作社把大量生活用品供应给农民和牧民。商人们也都纷纷筹集资金，准备收购土产。贸易公司茶叶门市部在昌都通车前，就把茶价降低了四分之一。公营商店和合作社的门口，每天不到开业时间，就挤满顾客。
    这种欣欣向荣的景象，还只是一个开端。康藏公路全线通车以后，昌都会更加繁荣，藏族人民生活会越过越美好。现在从内地运来的是藏民的日用必需品，将来汽车还可以运来轻型机器，在昌都建立工厂。现在协助藏族人民建设新昌都的技师、工人已经陆续赶来，并且已经建造起许多石厂和砖瓦厂。今年年前，准备修建一千多平方公尺的房屋。更大规模的建设将在明年开始，明年昌都的建筑总面积将达到五万平方公尺。这批建筑物中，包括二百五十张床位的设备齐全的医院、具有相当规模的兽医院和人民礼堂等。
    康藏公路通车到昌都，使广大藏族人民的心中充满了无限的兴奋和愉快，来迎接迅速到来的美好的日子。（新华社记者赵慎应、袁传方）
