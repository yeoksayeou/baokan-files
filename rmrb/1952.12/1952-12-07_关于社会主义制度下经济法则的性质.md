    On the Nature of Economic Laws Under the Socialist System
    Soviet Union, Lumyantsev
    "…Under the socialist system, the laws of political economy are objective laws that reflect the regularities of the economic life process, independent of our will. To deny this principle is, in fact, to deny science, and to deny science is to deny any possibility of prediction, and thus to deny the possibility of leading economic life."
    Stalin: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR"
    Comrade Stalin's new brilliant work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," is the greatest contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. In this work, Comrade Stalin raised and resolved the fundamental issues of socialist political economy, pointed out the path of gradual transition from socialism to communism, and made a scientific exploration of the problems of modern capitalism.
    Marxist-Leninist political economy is an important component of the great teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. It touches upon the most profound foundations of human social life, elucidates the laws governing the economic development of society, and points out the inevitability of the demise of capitalism and its replacement by the most progressive social system—communism. Precisely because of this, the enemies of socialism have always fiercely and hatefully attacked the economic theories of Marxism-Leninism.
    The bourgeoisie fears a truly scientific exposition of the laws of social economic development. It demands that its hired scholars do not reveal objective truth but create "theories" that suit them and are beneficial to them, theories that use various methods to defend capitalism, obscure the inherent contradictions of capitalism, and spread lies about socialism. Lenin once pointed out: "Nor can one expect this science to take a different attitude, for in a society built on class struggle, there can be no 'impartial' social science." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 19, p. 3, Russian edition)
    The bourgeoisie, attempting to disarm the working class ideologically and thereby consolidate its rule, has experimented with all methods of "eliminating" Marxism. It has tried and continues to try, through its hired agents in the workers' movement, to distort the teachings of Marxism-Leninism in every possible way. But the living truth of Marxism has destroyed all the obstacles set by the bourgeoisie in its path.
    The classic writers of scientific communism, Lenin and Stalin, gave a fatal rebuff to all hostile attempts to distort Marxism, defended the purity of revolutionary theory, and continued to develop it, adapting it to the era of the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism.
    The period of our socialist construction was a period of intense struggle by the Communist Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, to fight for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory against the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and other enemies of Leninism. The establishment of a society with unprecedented socialist economic forms requires our Party to deeply and scientifically lead the construction, to be good at correctly pointing out the direction to the masses at each stage of socialist construction, to reveal to them the clear prospects of this construction, and to strengthen their confidence in victory.
    Each new stage in the struggle for communism requires a profound theoretical exposition of the achievements already made and the determination of the correct path to achieve the stated goals. The Communist Party and its leader put forward new tasks when the necessary conditions for successfully completing those new tasks mature.
    Comrade Stalin wrote as early as 1905: "…The theoretician of a class cannot create ideas whose elements do not exist in life; he can only discern the elements of the future and, on this basis, theoretically create the ideal that a class will achieve in practice. The difference lies in the fact that the theoretician is ahead of the class, seeing the germs of the future earlier than it does." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 1, p. 117, Russian edition)
    In his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin discovered the future factors in the actual situation of our socialism. He put forward programmatic principles regarding the basic prerequisites for the Soviet society's preparation for the transition to communism.
    Comrade Malenkov pointed out in the summary report of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress: "…The Party's plan for the future, which determines our future and the path we will follow in our advancement, is formulated on the basis of knowledge of economic laws, on the basis of the science of building a communist society elucidated by Comrade Stalin."
    The question of the nature of economic laws under the socialist system, explored by Comrade Stalin, has great theoretical and practical significance for the construction of communism. This fundamental methodological question of political economy has been formulated with exceptional clarity by Comrade Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin gave extremely strict criticism to the subjective idealist concepts of some people who believe that, due to the special role of the socialist state, it can abolish, eliminate existing laws, formulate and "transform" them, and create new laws. In pointing out the serious error of this view of economic laws under the socialist system, Comrade Stalin gave a classical definition to scientific laws, that is, the laws of political economy.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "Marxism understands scientific laws—whether they are laws of natural science or laws of political economy—as the reflection of objective processes that do not depend on the will of men."
    Stalin's analysis of the objectivity of scientific laws proceeds from the theoretical principles of Marx, Engels, and Lenin regarding the laws of nature and society. As is well known, science is a systematic knowledge of the world around us, which also includes knowledge about society. Science lets us know the correct state of the world, that is, the correct reflection of objective reality in our consciousness. The purpose and task of science is to know the world around us, to find the laws of development inherent in it, and to make these laws serve mankind.
    Every true scientific law is a reflection of those essential connections inherent in the objective world itself, independent of people's will and consciousness.
    The laws of nature and society express the internal, essential relationships, that is, the objective causes of the connection of phenomena. When science recognizes these relationships and connections, it discovers the objective laws of development.
    Lenin wrote: "The world is matter in lawful motion, and our knowledge, being the highest product of nature, is only able to reflect this lawfulness." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 14, p. 156, Russian edition)
    The laws of political economy are objective laws. Stalin wrote that the laws of socialist political economy are the reflection in people's minds of an objective regularity that exists outside us.
    Economic laws are produced on the basis of certain conditions of material production. Marxism-Leninism teaches that the production of material goods is the foundation of human social existence and development. This production is realized as a natural need of human life. In order to survive and develop, people must constantly produce the material necessities of life. Only when social production manifests the unity of the social productive forces and the production relations of the people can the production of material goods be realized. Outside of this unity, social production in general cannot exist.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "Only with these two aspects of production can there be social production—whether under socialism or other social forms."
    Productive forces cannot exist and develop outside of society. People cannot produce material goods if they are isolated from each other, if they do not unite for common activities, and if they do not form certain connections and relations among themselves.
    People cannot freely choose their productive forces. Each generation obtains ready-made productive forces from their predecessors, and these productive forces are the starting point for further social development. People cannot freely choose their production relations either; production relations depend on a certain level of development of the social productive forces. The level of development of the productive forces determines the nature of the production relations. Included in the production relations are: the form of ownership of the means of production and the resulting position and interrelationship of various social groups in production, as well as the form of product distribution, which is entirely dependent on production relations. The sum total of production relations constitutes the economic system, constitutes the foundation of society.
    Objective economic laws are laws of social production itself, not laws of our consciousness.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "People can discover these laws, recognize them, study them, estimate them in their actions, and use them for the benefit of society, but people cannot change or abolish these laws, and especially cannot formulate or create new scientific laws."
    The object of political economy is the production relations, that is, the economic relations of the people. Its mission is to discover the laws of social production and the distribution of material goods in order to arm people with knowledge of the path of human social development. Two In his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin explained the objective nature of the laws of political economy and formulated important theoretical theorems about the characteristics of economic laws and their distinction from natural laws.
    Comrade Stalin taught: "One of the characteristics of political economy lies in the fact that its laws, unlike the laws of natural science, are not permanent and unchanging; the laws of political economy, at least most of them, operate in a certain historical period, after which they give way to new laws."
    The fact that most economic laws of political economy are not permanent and unchanging determines that they are produced and operate only on the basis of certain economic conditions within a certain economic formation. For example, the law of surplus value, the general law of capital accumulation, and other economic laws can only exist within the scope of capitalism and cannot exist in a socialist society.
    Every socioeconomic formation has only one basic economic law peculiar to it. The basic economic law does not determine a particular aspect or some individual processes of the development of this economic formation, but determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of its development.
    The main features and requirements of the basic economic law peculiar to modern capitalism are: to ensure maximum capitalist profit by exploiting and bankrupting and impoverishing the majority of the inhabitants of the country, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially backward countries, and by means of wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring maximum profit.
    Socialism has its own peculiar basic economic law, the main features and requirements of which are: to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole of society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of advanced technology.
    The fundamental difference between the basic economic laws of capitalism and socialism arises from the difference in their economic foundations, arising from the essence of their respective modes of production.
    On the basis of certain economic conditions, other economic laws are also produced, which determine individual aspects and individual processes of that mode of production. The action of these economic laws is subordinate to the action of the basic economic law. Under the socialist system, this unique economic law, which is inextricably linked with its basic economic law, is the law of planned, proportional development of the national economy. This law arises from the abolition of capitalism, on the basis of the public ownership of the means of production, as an antithesis to the laws of competition and anarchy of production under the capitalist system.
    The replacement of some peculiar laws in society by other laws is not accomplished by abolishing old laws and creating new laws according to the will of the people. This replacement occurs objectively, independent of the will of the people, but due to the emergence of new economic conditions, new production relations.
    Comrade Stalin instructed that the old laws are not eliminated, but lose their effect and withdraw from the stage due to the appearance of new economic conditions, giving way to new laws, which are not created by the will of the people, but are produced on the basis of new economic conditions.
    At the same time, there exist not only economic laws peculiar to this or that social formation, but also general laws common to all social formations.
    Comrade Stalin taught: "Various social formations, in their economic development, are not only subject to their own peculiar economic laws, but also to economic laws common to all social formations, for example, the law of the unity of productive forces and production relations in single social production, the law of the relationship between productive forces and production relations in the development process of all social formations. Therefore, various social formations are not only separated from each other by their own peculiar laws, but also linked to each other by economic laws common to all social formations."
    Without these common laws, there would be no unified political economy of the various social formations. Three In Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," a profound analysis is given to the possibility of the society recognizing and utilizing objective economic laws. This work ideologically arms the working people to engage in the active struggle to transform the world.
    Comrade Stalin criticized the anti-Marxist views of those who believe that the objectivity of economic laws means that their action cannot be prevented, and that society is powerless before them. This view idolizes the laws and makes oneself a slave of the laws.
    Historical experience, especially the experience of socialist societies, convincingly proves that society is not powerless before the laws, and that at the same time society, after recognizing economic laws, can rely on them and utilize them for the benefit of society.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out the erroneous view that it is only under the socialist system that it is possible to utilize economic laws for the benefit of society.
    Comrade Stalin wrote: "To a certain extent, utilizing economic processes and economic laws for the benefit of society also occurs not only under the socialist system and the communist system, but also under other social formations."
    However, discovering and utilizing objective economic laws, unlike discovering and utilizing natural laws, does not proceed smoothly. Comrade Stalin instructed that the important feature of economic laws is that, unlike natural science laws, in natural science, the discovery and application of new laws is carried out more or less smoothly; in the field of economics, the discovery and application of new laws that violate the interests of the decaying forces of society encounters extremely strong resistance from these forces. This is another feature of economic laws.
    Comrade Stalin instructed that in class society, the utilization of economic laws always and everywhere has a class background, and that the flag-bearer of utilizing economic laws for the benefit of society is always and everywhere the advanced class, while the decaying class resists this matter.
    The decaying social forces frantically resist the discovery and utilization of new economic laws with all the means they possess. They do so because the new laws contradict their class interests. Adopting the new laws will oppose the old production relations and infringe upon the vested interests of the decaying classes.
    In order to ensure the transition of society from one stage of development to another and to give new laws a broad space to function, there must be social forces in society that are extraordinarily concerned about realizing this progressive transition. Only such progressive social forces can utilize economic laws to give them the broad space for development necessary for the benefit of the entire society.
    In modern capitalist society, the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of productive forces has long been paving the way for itself.
    In our country, the alliance of workers and peasants, an advanced social force that is deeply interested in overthrowing capitalism and building socialism, has been found. This force has not yet been found in other capitalist countries. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet regime, relying on the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of productive forces, made the means of production public, making them the property of society, eliminated the system of exploitation, replaced the old production relations that had become an obstacle to the development of social production with new ones, and thereby gave the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of productive forces a broad space to function.
    The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various capitalist countries are leading the working class in the struggle to solve this mature task, gathering the broad masses of working people around the proletariat and educating that advanced social force: the mission of this force is to overcome the resistance of the modern bourgeoisie, to give the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of productive forces a broad space to function, and at the same time to lead the society of various countries to the victory of socialism.
    In his historic speech at the 19th Party Congress, Comrade Stalin instructed the Marxist-Leninist parties of various capitalist countries to correctly unite the masses of the people around their banner of struggle for peace, for democracy, and for socialism. The bourgeoisie has become more reactionary, it has abandoned the last remnants of past liberalism and the banner of bourgeois democratic freedom. It has abandoned the banner of national independence and national sovereignty, therefore, it has lost its past connection with the people and weakened itself. Comrade Stalin instructed that these banners will have to be raised by the Communist Party and the various democratic parties in order to unite the majority of the people around them, to become the leading force of the nation, and finally to lead the people to the victory of socialism and democracy.
    In socialist society, there are no decaying classes capable of organizing resistance to the discovery and utilization of new economic laws. Therefore, these laws obtain the full and broad space for their action.
    However, Comrade Stalin instructed that this cannot eliminate a certain degree of non-antagonistic contradictions between the productive forces and the production relations under the socialist system. These contradictions cannot reach the point of conflict because socialist society has the possibility of timely adapting the backward production relations to the nature of the productive forces. In order to overcome the contradictions that arise, the correct policy of the leading organs of socialist society has decisive significance; they timely see these contradictions and take measures to overcome these contradictions by adapting the production relations to the growth of the productive forces.
    The party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government have shown outstanding examples in taking measures to overcome the contradictions arising in our economy. The policy of the party, which constitutes the basis of life of the Soviet system, is based on the profound understanding and utilization of socialist economic laws for the benefit of society.
    The socialist system arises and develops on the basis of the society consciously applying objective economic laws. Spontaneity and spontaneous forces are incompatible with socialism. Therefore, those who confuse the objective nature of economic laws with the spontaneity of their action are completely contrary to Marxism-Leninism in their views. Under the conditions of socialism, confusing objectivity with spontaneity leads to a failure to recognize economic laws and to confusing socialist economic laws with capitalist economic laws; the party has long crushed and repelled this capitulationist view.
    Under the conditions of the capitalist system, under the rule of private ownership of the means of production, economic laws operate blindly, coercively, and destructively. Under socialism, which is based on public ownership of the means of production, on the contrary, the operation of economic laws is recognized by society. Society is able for the first time in history to recognize objective laws, rely on them, and utilize them for the benefit of society. Under the new conditions, the economic role of the state is fundamentally changed. The Soviet state, led by the Communist Party, is a powerful force influencing the development and consolidation of the economic foundation of socialist society. Only the socialist state realizes the economic-organizational and cultural-educational functions, which acquire increasingly greater significance as Soviet society advances towards communism.
    The Party and the Soviet state, relying on the theory of Marxism-Leninism, relying on the recognition of the objective economic laws of socialism, organize the masses to actively participate in the construction of the new social and economic formation. The conscious utilization of socialist economic laws is first reflected in the economic policy of our Party and state, and reflected in the annual and five-year plans of our national economy.
    The objective law of planned development of the national economy makes it possible for the Soviet state to plan social production. But in order to realize this possibility, Comrade Stalin said that it is necessary to study this economic law, it is necessary to master it, it is necessary to learn to apply it with complete knowledge, and it is necessary to formulate plans that fully reflect the requirements of this law. Comrade Stalin instructed that the planning of the national economy can only achieve good results if the following two conditions are observed. These two conditions are: that it correctly reflects the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy, and that it is adapted to all the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. Various denials of the objective nature of economic laws under the socialist system lead to adventurism in economic life and to all the destructive consequences for society.
    The deeper socialist society recognizes the objective economic laws of its own development, the higher the creative initiative of the masses in the struggle to build a communist society.
    The publication of Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is the greatest historical event in the ideological life of our party and the entire progressive humanity. This work is clear evidence of the great Stalin's constant concern for the further comprehensive development of Marxist-Leninist theory.
    Comrade Stalin's brilliant work charges party workers and workers in the field of social science, especially economists, to comprehensively study the theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism in close connection with the actual construction work. Comrade Stalin's work charges every active builder of communist society to deeply master the economic theory of Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrade Stalin's classic works are a great model for the creative development of Marxism-Leninism and a powerful guide to action. They enable the party to clearly see the purpose of our forward movement and to strive for and consolidate victory faster and more firmly.
    Comrade Stalin's new work illuminates the path for the people to advance towards the victory of communism.

    关于社会主义制度下经济法则的性质
    苏联　鲁缅采夫
    “……在社会主义制度下，政治经济学的法则是反映不以我们的意志为转移的经济生活过程的规律性的客观法则。否认这个原理的人，事实上就是否认科学，而否认科学，也就是否认任何预见的可能性，因而就是否认领导经济生活的可能性。”
    斯大林：“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    斯大林同志的新的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是马克思—列宁主义宝库的最伟大的贡献。在这部著作中，斯大林同志提出并解决了社会主义政治经济学的基本问题，指示出由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路，并对现代资本主义的问题做了科学的探讨。
    马克思—列宁主义的政治经济学，是马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林伟大学说的重要组成部分。它涉及到人类社会生活的最深刻的基础，阐明主宰社会经济发展的诸法则，指出资本主义的灭亡和为最进步的社会制度—共产主义所代替的必然性。正因如此，社会主义的敌人们过去和现在都是猛烈地和仇恨地抨击马克思—列宁主义的经济理论。
    资产阶级害怕对社会的经济发展法则做真正科学的阐述。它要求自己的御用学者们不要揭破客观真理，而要创造适合于他们并有益于他们的“理论”，这些理论要用各种方法为资本主义辩护，抹煞资本主义所固有的矛盾并传播有关社会主义的谎言。列宁曾指出说：“也决不能期望这个科学持另一种态度，因为在建筑于阶级斗争上的社会里是不会有‘公正’的社会科学的。”（列宁全集第十九卷第三页，俄文版）
    资产阶级企图在思想上解除工人阶级的武装并以此来巩固自己的统治权，它曾试验过一切“消灭”马克思主义的方法。它过去和现在都试图借助于自己在工人运动中的雇佣代理人千方百计地歪曲马克思—列宁主义的学说。但是马克思主义的生活真理摧毁了资产阶级在它的道路上所设置的一切障碍。
    科学共产主义的经典作家列宁和斯大林给予了一切歪曲马克思主义的敌意企图以致命的回击，保卫了革命理论的纯洁，并继续发展了它，使之适合于资本主义灭亡和社会主义胜利的时代。
    在我国社会主义建设的时期，是共产党在斯大林同志领导下争取马克思—列宁主义理论的纯洁，反对托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子和列宁主义的其他敌人的紧张斗争时期。建立空前的社会主义经济形式的社会，要求我党深入地科学地领导建设，善于在社会主义建设的每个阶段正确地给群众指出方向，揭示给他们这一建设的明朗远景，加强他们胜利的信心。一
    争取共产主义斗争的每个新阶段，须要对已获得的成就有深刻的理论阐述和确定实现既定目标的正确道路。共产党及其领袖当顺利完成新任务的必要条件成熟时，便会提出新的任务。
    斯大林同志还在一九○五年时便写道：“……某
    一阶级的理论家不能创造其因素是在生活中不存在的思想，他只能看出将来的因素，并在这个基础上理论地创造某一阶级在实践中将达到的理想，差别就在于：理论家赶过了阶级，比它早看出将来的萌芽。”（斯大林全集第一卷第一一七页，俄文版）
    斯大林同志在其天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”内，发现了我国社会主义的实际情形中的将来的因素。他提出有关苏维埃社会准备过渡到共产主义的基本先决条件的纲领性原理。
    马林科夫同志在第十九次党代表大会联共（布）
    中央委员会的总结报告中指示说：“……党关于未来的计划即决定我们的前途以及我们在前进中所要遵循的道路，就是依据经济法则的知识，依据斯大林同志所阐明的建设共产主义社会的科学而制定的。”
    为斯大林同志所探讨的关于社会主义制度下经济法则的性质问题，对于共产主义的建设具有重大的理论和实践意义。这个政治经济学的基本方法论问题，已为斯大林同志异常清晰地拟制出来。
    斯大林同志对于一些人的主观的唯心论的概念，给与了极严格的批评。这些人认为由于社会主义国家的特殊作用，它便能废除、消灭现存的法则，制定和“改造”它们、创造新的法则。斯大林同志在指出对社会主义制度下经济法则的这种看法的严重错误时，赋予了科学的法则，即政治经济学法则以经典性的定义。
    斯大林同志指示说：“马克思主义把科学法则——无论是指自然科学法则或政治经济学法则都一样——了解为不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。”
    斯大林对于科学法则的客观性的分析，是从马克思、恩格斯、列宁关于自然和社会的法则的理论原理出发的。如所周知，科学是关于我们周围世界的系统知识，其中也包括关于社会的知识。科学使我们知道世界的正确情况，即客观现实在我们意识中的正确反映。科学的目的和任务是认识我们周围的世界，找到它内部固有的发展法则并使这些法则为人类服务。
    每一种真正的科学的法则，都是不以人们的意志和意识为转移的、都是为人所认识的客观世界本身所具有的那些本质上的联系的反映。
    自然和社会的法则，表现着内部的本质的关系即现象联系的客观原因。科学在认识这些关系和联系时，便发现出客观的发展法则。
    列宁写道：“世界是物质的合规律的运动，而且我们的认识，既然是自然的最高产物，所以只能够反映这个规律性。”（列宁全集第十四卷第一五六页，俄文版）
    政治经济学的法则是客观的法则。斯大林写道，社会主义政治经济学的法则是存在于我们身外的客观规律性在人们头脑中的反映。
    经济法则是在物质生产的一定条件的基础上产生的。马克思—列宁主义教导说，物质资料的生产是人类社会存在和发展的基础。这种生产是作为人的生活的自然需要而实现的。人们为了生存和发展，必须时时生产他们所必需的物质生活资料。只有在社会生产表现着社会生产力和人们的生产关系两方面的统一时，物质资料的生产才能实现。在这种统
    一之外，社会生产一般是不能存在的。
    斯大林同志指示说：“只有具备生产的这两方面，才能有社会生产，——不管在社会主义制度下或其他社会形态下都是一样。”
    生产力不能在社会之外存在和发展。人们如果彼此孤立地、不为了共同活动而联合起来、不在自己之间结成一定的联系和关系，便不能生产物质资料。
    人们不能自由选择自己的生产力。每一代都从他们的先辈获得现成的生产力，这些生产力便是社会进一步发展的出发点。人们也不能自由选择自己的生产关系，生产关系是有赖于社会生产力发展的一定水平的。生产力发展的水平怎样，生产关系也是怎样。包括在生产关系之内的有：生产资料的所有制形式和由此产生的各种不同社会集团在生产中的地位及其相互关系，以及完全以生产关系为转移的产品分配形式。生产关系的总和就组成经济制度、组成社会的基础。
    客观的经济法则是社会生产本身的法则，而不是我们意识的法则。
    斯大林同志指示说：“人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，研究它们，在自己的行动中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，但是人们不能改变或废除这些法则，尤其不能制定或创造新的科学法则。”
    政治经济学的对象是人们的生产关系即经济关系。它的使命是发现社会生产和物质资料分配的法则，以人类社会发展道路的知识武装人们。二在“苏联社会主义经济问题”著作中，斯大林同志解释出政治经济学法则的客观性质，制订出关于经济法则的特点及其与自然法则的区别的重要理论定理。
    斯大林同志教导说：“政治经济学的特点之一就在于：它的法则与自然科学的法则不同，不是长久不变的；政治经济学法则，至少是其中大多数，是在一定的历史时期中发生作用的，在此以后，它们就让位给新的法则。”
    政治经济学的大多数经济法则不是长久不变的，这便决定了它们只在某一经济形态范围内的一定经济条件基础上产生和发生作用。例如，剩余价值法则，资本积累的普遍法则和其他经济法则，只能存在于资本主义的范围之内，而不能存在于社会主义社会之中。
    每一种社会经济形态，只有它所固有的一个基本经济法则。基本经济法则不是决定这一经济形态发展的某一个别方面或某些个别过程，而是决定其发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程。
    现代资本主义所特有的基本经济法则，其主要特点和要求是：用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。
    社会主义具有它自己特有的基本经济法则，其主要特点和要求是：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    资本主义和社会主义基本经济法则的根本区别，是由于它们的经济基础的区别产生的，由它们各自生产方式的实质产生的。
    在一定的经济条件的基础上，也产生着其他经济法则，这些经济法则决定该生产方式的个别方面和个别过程。这些经济法则的作用从属于基本经济法则的作用。在社会主义制度下这种与其基本经济法则不可分割地联系着的特有的经济法则，便是国民经济有计划的、按比例的发展法则。这一法则是由于消灭了资本主义，在生产资料公有化的基础上，作为资本主义制度下竞争和生产无政府状态的法则的对立物而产生的。
    社会中的一些特有的法则为其他法则所代替，并不是用依照人们的意志消灭旧法则和创造新法则的办法而完成的。这种代替是客观地发生的，不以人们的意志为转移，而是由于产生了新的经济条件，新的生产关系。
    斯大林同志指示说，旧法则并不是被消灭，而是由于出现了新的经济条件而失去效力，退出舞台，让位给新的法则，这些新的法则并不是由人们的意志创造出来，而是在新的经济条件的基础上产生的。
    同时，不仅存在有这一或那一社会形态所特有的经济法则，而且还有各社会形态都有的一般法则。
    斯大林同志教导说：“各种不同的社会形态在它的经济发展中，不仅服从自己特有的经济法则，而且还服从一切社会形态所共有的经济法则，例如，在单一的社会生产中生产力和生产关系的统一的法则，在一切社会形态发展过程中生产力和生产关系间的关系法则。所以，各个社会形态不仅以自己特有的法则互相分开着，而且以一切社会形态所共有的经济法则互相联系着。”
    如果没有这些共有的法则，也就不会有各个社会形态的统一的政治经济学了。三在斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，对为社会所认识和利用客观的经济法则的可能，给与了深刻的分析。这一著作在思想上武装劳动人民从事改造世界的积极斗争。
    斯大林同志批评了那些人的反马克思主义的观点：他们认为经济法则的客观性意味着它们的作用无法防止，社会在它们面前是无力的。这种观点是把法则偶像化，是让自己去做法则的奴隶。
    历史经验，特别是社会主义社会的经验，令人信服地证明了社会在法则面前并不是无能为力的，同时社会在认识了经济法则之后，依靠着它们便可利用它们来为社会谋福利。
    斯大林同志指出认为只有在社会主义制度下才有可能利用经济法则为社会谋福利的错误看法。
    斯大林同志写道：“在某种程度内利用经济过程、经济法则来为社会谋福利，这样的事情也不仅在社会主义制度和共产主义制度下发生，而且在其他社会形态下也发生。”
    然而，发现和利用客观的经济法则，不同于发现和利用自然法则，不是顺利进行的。斯大林同志指示说，经济法则的重要特点在于它与自然科学法则不同，在自然科学中，发现和应用新的法则是或多或少顺利地进行的；在经济学领域中，发现和应用那些触犯社会衰朽力量的利益的新法则，要遇到这些力量极强烈的反抗。经济法则的另一个特点就在于此。
    斯大林同志指示说，在阶级社会里利用经济法则无论何时何地都有阶级背景，而且利用经济法则为社会谋福利的旗手无论何时何地都是先进阶级，而衰朽的阶级则反抗这件事情。
    衰朽了的社会力量用他们所拥有的一切手段疯狂地抵抗发现和利用新的经济法则，他们之所以这样做，是因为新的法则和他们的阶级利益相矛盾，采用新的法则是会反对旧的生产关系，触犯到衰朽着的阶级的切身利益。
    为了要保证社会从一个发展阶段过渡到另一个阶段，给新法则以发生作用的广阔场所，社会中必须有异常关怀实现这一进步过渡的社会力量，只有这种进步的社会力量才能利用经济法则，给它们以为了全社会利益所必需的广阔发展场所。
    在现代资本主义社会中，生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的这一经济法则，早已为自己开辟着道路。
    在我国找到了工农联盟这一对推翻资本主义和建设社会主义有切身利害关系的先进社会力量，这种力量还没有在其他各资本主义国家中找到。苏维埃政权在列宁—斯大林党的领导下，依靠着生产关系
    一定要适合生产力性质的这一经济法则，把生产资料公有化，使它们成为社会的财产，消灭了剥削制度，用新的代替了已成为社会生产发展阻力的旧的生产关系，并以此给与生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则以发生作用的广阔场所。
    各资本主义国家的共产党和工人党，领导着工人阶级争取解决这一成熟了的任务的斗争，把广大劳动群众聚集在无产阶级周围并教育那一先进的社会力量：这个力量的使命就是克服现代资产阶级的反抗，给与生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一经济法则发生作用的广阔场所，同时引导各国的社会走向社会主义的胜利。
    斯大林同志在党的第十九次代表大会上的历史性演说中，给各资本主义国家的马克思—列宁主义的政党指示出把人民群众团结在自己争取和平、争取民主、争取社会主义的斗争旗帜周围的正确道路。资产阶级已变得更加反动了，它已把过去的自由主义的最后残余和资产阶级民主自由的旗帜抛弃在一边。它已把民族独立和国家主权的旗帜抛在一边，因此，它已失掉了过去与人民的联系，削弱了自己。斯大林同志指示说，这些旗帜将必须由共产党和各民主政党举起来，以把大多数人民团结在自己周围，以成为民族的领导力量，并最后领导人民走向社会主义和民主主义的胜利。
    在社会主义社会中，没有能够组织反抗发现和利用新的经济法则的衰朽的阶级。因此这些法则便获得自己发生作用的充分广阔场所。
    然而，斯大林同志指示说，这并不能铲除在社会主义制度下生产力和生产关系之间的某种程度的非对抗性的矛盾。这种矛盾不能达到发生冲突，因为社会主义社会具有及时使落后的生产关系与生产力的性质相适合的可能。为了克服产生的矛盾，社会主义社会领导机关的正确政策具有决定性的意义，它们及时看出这些矛盾并以生产关系适应生产力增长的方法采取措施克服这些矛盾。
    列宁、斯大林的党，苏联政府在采取措施以克服我们经济中产生的矛盾方面表示出卓越的范例。构成苏维埃制度的生活基础的党的政策，是依据着深刻认识和利用社会主义的经济法则来为社会谋福利。
    社会主义制度是在社会自觉地运用客观的经济法则的基础上发生和发展着的。自流和自发势力是与社会主义不相容的。因此，那些把经济法则的客观性质和它的作用的自发性混为一谈的人，他们的观点是与马克思—列宁主义完全背道而驰的。在社会主义的条件下，把客观性和自发作用混为一谈，会导致不能认识经济法则，会把社会主义的经济法则和资本主义的经济法则混淆在一起；党早已就粉碎了和击退了这种投降分子的观点。
    在资本主义制度的条件下，在生产资料的私有制的统治下，经济法则是盲目地、强制地、破坏性地起着作用。在基于生产资料公有制的社会主义的条件下则与此相反，经济法则的发生作用是为社会所认识了的。社会在历史上第一次能够认识客观法则、依靠它们、利用它们来为社会谋福利。在新的条件下，国家的经济作用是根本改变了。为共产党所领导着的苏维埃国家，是影响社会主义社会经济基础的发展和巩固的强大力量。只有社会主义国家实现着经济—组织的和文化—教育的职能，这个职能依照苏联社会向共产主义前进的程度而获得愈来愈重大的意义。
    党和苏维埃国家，依靠着马克思—列宁主义的理论，依靠着对社会主义的客观经济法则的认识，组织群众来积极参加新的社会经济形态的建筑。自觉地利用社会主义的经济法则，首先反映在我党和国家的经济政策之中，反映在我们国民经济的各年的和五年计划之中。
    国民经济有计划发展的客观法则，使苏维埃国家有可能计划社会生产。但是为了实现这个可能，斯大林同志说，就必须研究这个经济法则，必须掌握它，必须学会以完备的知识去应用它，必须制定出能完全反映这个法则的要求的计划。斯大林同志指示说，国民经济的计划化，只有在遵守下列两个条件时，才能得到良好的结果。这两个条件是：它正确地反映国民经济有计划发展的法则的要求，它和社会主义的基本经济法则的一切要求相适应。对社会主义制度下经济法则的客观性质的各种否认，导致在经济生活中的冒险主义和对社会产生一切毁灭性的后果。
    社会主义社会对自己发展的客观的经济法则认识得愈深，群众在争取建设共产主义社会斗争中的创造积极性也就愈高。
    斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的出版，是我党和全体进步人类思想生活中的最伟大的历史事件。这一著作是伟大的斯大林关于进一步全面发展马克思—列宁主义理论的经常关怀的鲜明证据。
    斯大林同志的天才著作，责成党的工作者、社会科学方面的工作者，首先是经济学者在与实际的建设工作密切联系下全面地研究马克思—列宁主义的理论问题。斯大林同志的著作，责成每个共产主义社会的积极建设者深刻掌握马克思—列宁主义的经济理论。
    斯大林同志的经典著作，是创造性发展马克思—列宁主义的伟大典范，是行动的有力指南。它们使党能够清晰地看到我们前进运动的目的，更快地和更牢固地争取到和巩固胜利。
    斯大林同志的新著，给人民照亮了走向共产主义胜利的道路。
