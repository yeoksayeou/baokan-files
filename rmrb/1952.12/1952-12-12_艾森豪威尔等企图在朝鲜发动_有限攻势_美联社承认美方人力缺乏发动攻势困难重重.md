Xinhua News Agency dispatch: These days, Eisenhower is on the American cruiser "Helena," discussing with Dulles and others how to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. He is also preparing to go to Honolulu to hold military conferences with the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Radford, and others. War-monger MacArthur, who was beaten and bloodied by the Korean and Chinese people and rolled back to the United States, is now sticking his head out again and clamoring that he has a "clear and specific way" to resolve the Korean War. Various plans and proposals to continue and expand the war are being widely promoted in Washington and American newspapers and magazines. These people, who get rich by selling war, have completely abandoned the armistice negotiations.

However, their greedy desires are beyond their capabilities. The relentless reality forces the U.S. Department of Defense to only consider a "limited offensive." According to the International News Service, experts in the U.S. Department of Defense are studying such a plan, which includes launching a joint land, sea, and air attack to push the Korean front line about seventy-five miles north. The purpose of this plan is to "shorten the front line and improve transportation." The Department of Defense experts said that in order to "prevent a great increase in American casualties due to attacking the enemy's solid positions from the front, successful airborne and naval attacks are needed." The number one accomplice, Britain, has already expressed its agreement to this "limited offensive" plan. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 8th, British authorities said, "Britain would probably agree to launch a limited offensive to push the UN forces' front line to the narrower waist of Korea, which is easier to defend."

It can be seen that the "limited offensive" planned by the U.S. Department of Defense is an attempt to move the front line to the "narrow waist of Korea" to shorten the front line in order to alleviate its inherent difficulty—a shortage of manpower. However, an Associated Press report on November 22nd already admitted that the United States "due to fighting in Korea...the regular forces remaining in the United States are becoming increasingly empty. Some units are only empty shells." It also said, "The combat strength of U.S. domestic army units has decreased on average to about 64 percent." This is the real reason why they cannot even afford the casualty costs that this "limited offensive" is bound to incur. They place their hopes on "successful airborne and naval attacks," but past facts are enough to prove that any "attack" by the American invaders will be crushed under the iron fists of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Facts will tell the American invaders that they have no way out except to honestly resume armistice negotiations.

### 艾森豪威尔等企图在朝鲜发动“有限攻势”  美联社承认美方人力缺乏发动攻势困难重重

    艾森豪威尔等企图在朝鲜发动“有限攻势”
    美联社承认美方人力缺乏发动攻势困难重重
    据新华社讯：这几天，艾森豪威尔正在美国的“赫勒拿号”巡洋舰上和杜勒斯等商量继续和扩大侵略朝鲜战争的办法，他还准备到檀香山去和美国太平洋舰队司令雷德福等举行军事会议。被朝中人民打得头破血流而滚回美国去的战争贩子麦克阿瑟，现在又探出头来叫嚷说他有解决朝鲜战争的“明确而具体的办法”。各种各样继续和扩大战争的计划和方案正在华盛顿和美国的报章杂志上被广泛地宣传着。这些靠贩卖战争发财的人已经完全丢开了停战谈判。
    可是，他们要实现贪婪的欲望却是力不从心的，无情的现实迫使美国国防部只能考虑来一个“有限攻势”。据国际新闻社报道，美国国防部的专家们正在研究这样的一个计划，这个计划中包括发动一次陆、海、空联合攻击，以便把朝鲜战线向北推进约七十五英里。这个计划的目的是要“缩短战线和改善交通”。国防部的专家们说，为了“防止因为从正面进攻敌人的坚固阵地而大大增加的美军伤亡，就需要进行成功的伞兵与海军攻击”。头号帮凶英国已经表示同意这种“有限攻势”的计划，据合众社伦敦八日电报道，英国的权威人士说，“英国大概会同意发动有限攻势，把联合国军战线推进到比较容易防守的朝鲜的狭窄腰部”。
    可以看出，美国国防部所计划的“有限攻势”，是企图把战线移到“朝鲜的狭窄腰部”来缩短战线，以解救它的先天困难——人手不足。但是，美联社十一月二十二日的消息却已经承认：美国“由于在朝鲜作战，……留在美国的正规部队是愈来愈空虚了。某些部队只剩下一个空架子。”又说：“美国国内陆军部队的战斗力量平均减低到约百分之六十四。”这就是他们连这个“有限攻势”所一定要付出的伤亡代价都出不起的真实原因。他们把希望寄托在“成功的伞兵与海军攻击”上，可是过去的事实已足够证明，美国侵略者的任何“攻击”，都要在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的铁拳下粉碎。事实将要告诉美国侵略者，他们除了老老实实恢复停战谈判而外，什么出路都是没有的。
