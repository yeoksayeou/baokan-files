Based on Chairman Mao's instruction that "we must conscientiously hold the people's representative conferences of all circles well enough to unite the people of all circles to carry out work together," Licheng County, Shandong Province, established the people's representative conference of all circles in the winter of 1949. The conference was held every few months, and six sessions had been held before November 1951. The session held on November 29, 1951, elected the county people's government committee, including the county head, deputy county head, and members of the county people's government. According to the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the people's congress elected through universal suffrage is the organ for the people to exercise state power, and it should elect the people's government committee as the organ for the people to exercise state power during the recess of the people's congress. Before the convocation of the local people's congress through universal suffrage, the local people's representative conferences of all circles should gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress. In this way, the people's representative conference of all circles in Licheng County has the same powers as the people's congress. In May and August of this year, the county successively convened two people's representative conferences of all circles. Each conference discussed the current central tasks and the people's urgent demands, made resolutions, and immediately led the masses to implement them, thus realizing the democratic principle of the people managing their own affairs.

The people's representative conference of Licheng County has an extremely broad mass base. Most of the representatives are elected separately by people from all strata, people's organizations, democratic parties, and ethnic minorities, and a small number are invited by the government. The representatives mainly rely on organizations to carry out activities. Before each meeting, the county generally convenes township people's representative conferences (or peasant representative conferences) to publicize the current central tasks and the news of the convening of the county people's representative conference, and to widely collect proposals from the people. At the township people's representative conference, according to the specific situation of the township, the focus is on discussing the various tasks that should be done in the township and discussing the masses' proposals. Problems that can be solved in the district and township are immediately discussed and resolved, and problems that cannot be solved in the district and township are brought to the county people's representative conference. For example, the Shahe Township people's representative conference held in October 1951 discussed the problem of digging drainage ditches. At that time, the most prominent demand of the masses in the township was to build water conservancy projects, such as the request to dig the Hala Dam ditch. Digging this ditch could irrigate 600 to 700 mu of dry land and transform 400 mu of paddy fields. The representative who proposed this proposal said: "We have been asking for this matter to be done for the past thirty years. The Kuomintang government didn't care about our affairs before, and the local tyrant landlord Liu Lianpu of Yangjiatun didn't allow us to dig it, fearing that it would break the 'feng shui' of his family's graves. Now that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led us to turn over and become masters, the government is our own, and we must do this well. If we do this well, our poor Shahe will become a rich Shahe." The representatives exchanged many opinions on this issue and studied and discussed the surveying, measuring, work counting, compensation for excavated land, and material collection issues in the digging of the ditch, and put forward reasonable solutions. The township people's representative conferences convened by various townships prepared very well for the county people's representative conference and elected representatives to attend the county people's representative conference. In addition, various circles also held separate representative conferences, such as industry and commerce, culture and education, health, women, and youth representative conferences. In combination with the work of their respective departments, they prepared for the county people's representative conference, elected representatives to participate in the county people's representative conference, collected proposals, and discussed various issues separately. For example, before the people's representative conference of all circles in November 1951, the departmental work of the county industry and commerce section and the tax bureau was to organize the Federation of Industry and Commerce and investigate tax sources. During the preparation period of the county people's representative conference, the two departments held meetings of people from the industrial and commercial circles, on the one hand, to discuss industrial production, material exchange, and other issues, collect proposals, and elect representatives, and at the same time, they completed the work of merchant registration, organizing the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and investigating tax sources.

Through the above series of conferences, the convening of the county people's representative conference had a good work base and mass base. The county representatives, township representatives, and cadres at all levels who participated in the above conferences totaled about 14,000 people each time.

The proceedings of the meeting were very democratic. In each work report, the government examined the shortcomings in its work and mobilized representatives to put forward opinions and criticisms on the government's work and the style of cadres. At previous meetings, the representatives put forward many valuable opinions, such as criticizing the county-run farm for only distributing improved varieties of seedlings to the masses without providing technical guidance, resulting in some seedlings not surviving; criticizing the government for not establishing an organization to repair agricultural implements, resulting in the waterwheels and sprayers lent to the masses being broken and having no place to repair them, etc. The government humbly listened to the various criticisms of the people's representatives and took various measures to correct its mistakes after the meeting. For individual cadres' violations of law and discipline, the government promptly handled them after being reported by representatives. For example, at the meeting in November 1951, the county people's government, based on the opinions of the representatives, publicly dealt with two cadres who shielded landlords and violated law and discipline. The representatives were very moved and unanimously reflected: "It is really the people who are the masters of their own affairs." The county people's representative conference held on August 23, 1952, made new progress in promoting democracy. This meeting focused on discussing urban and rural material exchange and autumn agricultural production, and collected 391 proposals from the masses in advance, all of which were very important and constructive opinions. Such as the suggestion that the government vigorously promote the walking plow and open training classes to strengthen the guidance of the use of new walking plows, the suggestion that the government promote improved varieties of millet; many mutual aid groups suggested that the government strengthen leadership, etc. For these suggestions, the People's Government Committee and the Standing Committee jointly consulted and synthesized them into autumn work suggestions, which were handed over to the representatives for discussion. The representatives were very satisfied with this. They said: "These suggestions were all put forward by ourselves, and we are really enthusiastic about discussing them."

After the county people's representative conference made resolutions on the issues discussed, it immediately mobilized the representatives to go back and lead the masses to implement them. Generally, township people's representative conferences were held to convey the resolutions to the masses and discuss how to implement them. For example, after the county people's representative conference was held in August 1952, the county representative of Xiying Township returned to the township and publicized the resolutions of the county people's representative conference and the meeting situation to the masses of the whole township that night, and actively assisted the township people's government in convening the township people's representative conference. Influenced by the democratic spirit of the county people's representative conference, this time the township people's representative conference received more than 60 proposals and also made specific work resolutions. After the meeting, a mass patriotic production increase competition movement was launched. Because the people's representatives can lead the masses to implement the resolutions of the meeting, the central tasks put forward by the meeting quickly formed a mass movement in the county after each county people's representative conference. For example, after the meeting in November 1951, the masses launched a winter production movement, repairing 78 drainage ditches, which can protect 24,068 mu of fields; repairing 55 sluice ditches and more than 30 dams; repairing 109 irrigation ditches and digging more than 1,300 wells, which can irrigate more than 5,000 mu of land; digging more than 60 million jin of pit soil and dry well soil, which can top 6 million jin of soybean cake fertilizer. In this way, the winter production work was successfully completed, laying a good foundation for the patriotic bumper harvest movement in 1952. After the county convened the people's representative conference of all circles in May 1952, various mutual aid groups formulated summer production plans, and 80% of the county carried out wheat seed selection work; water conservancy construction was also widely carried out, with more than 1,200 wells dug in one month. After the township people's representative conference in Qinghe and Tantou townships, three ditches were dug in two days, which can irrigate more than 700 mu of land. The local masses happily said: This major event, the reactionary government did not complete it for several years, we completed it in two days.

    山东省历城县的各界人民代表会议开得好
    周方
    根据毛主席“必须认真地开好足以团结各界人民共同进行工作的各界人民代表会议”的指示，山东省历城县于一九四九年冬即建立了各界人民代表会议。会议每隔几个月召开一次，到一九五一年十一月以前，已召开了六次。一九五一年十一月二十九日召开的一次，选举了包括县长、副县长和县人民政府委员的县人民政府委员会。根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的规定，普选的人民代表大会是人民行使国家政权的机关，它应选举人民政府委员会，作为人民代表大会闭会期间人民行使政权的机关。而在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，则应由地方各界人民代表会议逐步地代行人民代表大会的职权。这样，历城县的各界人民代表会议就已具有和人民代表大会同等的权力。今年五月和八月，该县又先后召开了两次各界人民代表会议，每次会议都讨论了当前的中心工作和人民的迫切要求，作成决议并立即由代表领导群众执行，因之，会议实现了人民自己管理自己的事的民主原则。
    历城县的人民代表会议具有极广泛的群众基础。代表大部分是由各阶层人民、各人民团体、各民主党派和少数民族分别选举出来，少部分由政府邀请。代表主要依靠组织进行活动。在每次开会以前，全县普遍召开乡人民代表会议（或农民代表会议），宣传当前的中心工作和县人民代表会议的召开消息，向人民广泛收集提案。在乡人民代表会议上，根据本乡的具体情况，着重讨论本乡当前应做的各项工作和讨论群众提案。凡是本区本乡能够解决的问题，马上讨论解决，本区本乡不能解决的，就提到县人民代表会议上去。如一九五一年十月沙河乡召开的乡人民代表会议上就讨论了挖水沟的问题。当时该乡群众最突出的要求是兴修水利，如要求挖哈啦坝水沟。挖好这条水沟，能灌溉旱田六、七百亩，改造稻田四百亩。提出这一提案的代表说：“这件事在前三十年咱们就要求办，以前国民党政府不管咱们的事，杨家屯的恶霸地主刘连谱不让挖，怕破了他家坟地的‘风水’。现在共产党毛主席领导咱们翻了身，能当家作主了，政府是咱们自己的，无论如何要办成这件事情。办成这件事，咱们这个穷沙河就能变成富沙河了。”代表们就这一问题交换了许多意见，研究讨论了挖沟中的测量、计工、掘了地如何赔偿、材料如何筹集等问题，提出了合理解决的办法。各乡召集的这样的乡人民代表会议，就为县人民代表会议作了极好的准备，并选出出席县人民代表会议的代表。此外，各界也单独召开代表会议，如工商、文教、卫生、妇女、青年等代表会议，结合本部门的工作，为县人民代表会议作准备工作，选举参加县人民代表会议的代表，收集提案，并分别讨论各种问题。如一九五一年十一月各界人民代表会议召开之前，县工商科和税务局的部门工作是组织工商联合会和清查税源。两部门在县人民代表会议筹备期间，召开工商界人士会议，一方面讨论了工业生产，物资交流等问题，收集了提案，选出了代表，同时结合完成了商人登记、组织工商联合会及清查税源的工作。
    通过上述一系列的会议，县人民代表会议的召开便具备了良好的工作基础和群众基础。参加上述各种会议的县代表、乡代表和各级干部，每次共约一万四千余人。
    会议的进行是非常民主的。政府每次都在工作报告中检查工作中的缺点，并发动代表对政府工作和干部作风提出意见和进行批评。历次会议上，代表们提出了许多宝贵的意见，如批评县立农场只管发给群众优良品种的树苗，而不作技术指导，致有些树苗没有栽活；批评政府没有设立修理农具的机构，致使贷给群众的水车和喷雾器坏了没地方修理等。政府虚心听取人民代表的各种批评，并在会后采取各种措施改正错误。对于个别干部的违法乱纪行为，经代表检举后，政府即迅速处理。如在一九五一年十一月的会议上，县人民政府根据代表的意见，公开处理了两个包庇地主和违法乱纪的干部。代表们十分感动，一致反映：“真是人民当家作主”。一九五二年八月二十三日召开的县人民代表会议，在发扬民主方面又有新的进步。这次会议以讨论城乡物资交流及秋季农业生产为中心议题，事先搜集了群众提案三百九十一件，都是很重要的建设性的意见。如建议政府大力推广步犁，开设训练班以加强使用新式步犁的指导，建议政府推广优良品种的谷子；不少互助组建议政府加强领导等。对于这些建议，人民政府委员会与常务委员会共同协商后，综合成秋季工作建议，交代表们讨论。代表对此十分满意。他们说：“这些建议都是自己提出来的，讨论起来真起劲。”
    县人民代表会议就所讨论的问题作成决议后，立即动员代表回去领导群众执行。一般的都开乡人民代表会议，向群众传达决议，并讨论如何贯彻执行。如一九五二年八月县人民代表会议开过后，西营乡的县代表回乡，当晚就向全乡群众宣传县人民代表会议的决议及开会情况，并积极协助乡人民政府召开乡人民代表会议。乡人民代表会议受了县人民代表会议民主精神的影响，这次收到提案六十多件，也制成了具体的工作决议。会议以后，群众性的爱国增产竞赛运动随即展开。由于人民代表能领导群众贯彻执行会议决议，所以每次县人民代表会议以后，会议提出的中心工作很快便在全县形成群众性的运动。如一九五一年十一月的会议之后，群众展开了冬季生产运动，共修排水沟七十八条，可护田二万四千零六十八亩；修闸水沟五十五条，水坝三十余条；修灌溉沟一百零九条，打井一千三百余眼，可浇地五千余亩；挖坑土及旱井土六千余万斤，能顶六百万斤豆饼的肥料。这样就顺利地完成了冬季生产工作，为一九五二年的爱国丰产运动打下了良好的基础。一九五二年五月县召开各界人民代表会议后，各个互助组都订出了夏季生产计划，全县有百分之八十的地区进行了麦子的选种工作；水利建设也普遍开展，一月内打井一千二百多眼。清河、滩头两乡在乡人民代表会议后，两天内即挖沟三条，可浇地七百余亩。当地群众高兴地说：这件大事，反动政府几年都没有办成，我们两天就办成了。
