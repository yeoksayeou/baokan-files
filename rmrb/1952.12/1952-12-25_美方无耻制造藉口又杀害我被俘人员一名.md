Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 24th: According to an announcement by the US side, another prisoner of war was shot and killed on Geoje Island on the 21st. The US side's excuse was that the prisoner of war "left his place of residence and walked towards a restricted area" and "attempted to organize a secret meeting within the camp."

Observers here point out that it is no accident that the US side recently fabricated the excuse of prisoners of war entering a "restricted area" to organize "secret meetings" in order to kill prisoners of war. This is an extremely sinister and vicious trick. The massacre on Beehive Island and the news recently revealed from the newspapers of the Li Seung-man gang prove that, encouraged by the illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean issue, the US is conspiring to transfer all prisoners of war to the Li Seung-man gang in order to intensify the coercion of them into becoming cannon fodder. The US side knows that this illegal behavior will inevitably be met with resolute resistance from the prisoners of war, so they specially fabricated such a new excuse while killing prisoners of war who resolutely demand repatriation; they are clearly attempting to create an atmosphere of "prisoners of war plotting riots" now in order to prepare for larger-scale massacres in the future under the pretext of so-called "prisoners of war riots."

    美方无耻制造藉口又杀害我被俘人员一名
    【新华社开城二十四日电】据美方宣布，二十一日在巨济岛上又有战俘一名被打死。美方的藉口是：这名战俘“离开他住的地方向禁区走去”，“企图在营场内组织秘密会议”。
    此间观察家指出，美方最近捏造所谓战俘进入“禁区”组织“秘密会议”的藉口来杀害战俘，并不是偶然的。这是一个极端阴险恶毒的诡计。蜂岩岛的大屠杀事件，和最近从李承晚匪帮的报纸上透露出来的消息，证明美方在联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议鼓励之下，正在阴谋将战俘全部移交给李承晚匪帮，以便加紧强迫他们充当炮灰。美方知道，他们这种非法的行为必然要遭到战俘的坚决反抗，因此他们特地在杀害坚决要求遣返的战俘的同时，制造了这么一个新的藉口；他们显然企图现在就制造关于战俘“阴谋暴动”的空气，以便为将来以所谓“战俘暴动”的藉口进行更大规模的屠杀作好准备。
