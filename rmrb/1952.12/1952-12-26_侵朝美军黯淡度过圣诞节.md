Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: Due to the U.S. ruling clique's refusal to halt the war of aggression against Korea, demoralized U.S. soldiers spent a bleak Christmas on the frigid Korean front lines.

    An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on December 25th wrote: "Far from home, soldiers are huddled in frozen Korean foxholes for their third Christmas—some of whom will never see another Christmas. On countless lonely Korean positions, the dwindling soldiers of many nations greet the fresh dawn of Christmas by staring north at the snow-covered no-man's-land."

    United Press reporter Patton reported from the Western Front, "Many soldiers don't feel any Christmas cheer. One American soldier who participated in the battles of Bunker Hill and Hook said: 'This isn't Christmas at all.'" Patton described the situation of a U.S. company: the company had decorated a Christmas tree, "but they are not celebrating. Sergeant Hadley said, 'Just a day ago,' a soldier from his platoon was hit by a shell while crossing a rice paddy towards the command post, and he died next to the Christmas tree."

    International News Service reporter Harmov reported on the pro-war sentiments of five American soldiers in a "gloomy bunker" on the Western Front on Christmas Eve. He wrote: "They talked about the situation at home during Christmas... Death whistled overhead... They were all missing home." Squad Leader Philip said: "We cannot forget Christmas, we cannot forget what it meant to us in years past. You can't be strong at this time." The situation in the bunkers on the Eastern Front was the same, with United Press reporter Cave writing that on Christmas morning, "soldiers hiding in the bunkers were guarding while missing home."

    A gloomy atmosphere also shrouded the American air force units. Associated Press reporter Edward, who was with the Fourth Fighter Wing, wrote: "Christmas Eve at this air base was just like the previous night of another work day." American Saber jets still had to go to North Korea on Christmas Day, and "death lurks in the skies of North Korea." "The pilots don't talk about these things, nor do they talk about the missions they will fly tomorrow. What they talk about is home, their waiting wives and children who are learning to walk and talk."

### 侵朝美军黯淡度过圣诞节

    侵朝美军黯淡度过圣诞节
    【新华社二十五日讯】由于美国统治集团拒绝停止侵朝战争，士气沮丧的美军士兵在严寒的朝鲜前线度过黯淡的圣诞节。
    美联社东京二十五日电写道：“远离家乡的士兵们蜷缩在冰冻的朝鲜散兵坑里过第三个圣诞节——其中有些人将永远看不到另一个圣诞节了。在无数寂寞的朝鲜阵地上，许多国家的萎缩的士兵向北凝视着铺满白雪的无人地带，这样迎接着圣诞节的清新的拂晓。”
    合众社记者潘顿从西线报道说，“许多士兵感不到有过圣诞节的愉快心情。一个参加过地堡山和钩形山战役的美国士兵说：‘这根本不是圣诞节’。”潘顿描述了一个美军连队的情形：这个连队布置了圣诞树，“但是他们并不庆祝。中士哈德莱说：‘仅仅一天以前’，一个士兵从他的排穿过稻田走向指挥所时，被炮弹击中，他就死在圣诞树旁”。
    国际新闻社记者哈莫夫报道了在圣诞前夕西线一个“黯淡的地堡里”，五个美国士兵的厌战思家情绪。他写道：“他们谈论着圣诞节时家中的情况……死亡在头顶上呼啸……他们都在想念着家乡。”班长菲列普说：“我们不能忘记圣诞节，我们不能忘记它在过去的岁月中对我们的意义。在这个时候，你是无法坚强起来的。”在东线地堡里的情形也是一样，合众社记者凯夫写道：在圣诞节的清晨，
    “躲在地堡里的士兵们，一面守候，一面想家。”
    黯淡的气氛也笼罩在美国的空军部队里，美联社随第四战斗机联队记者爱德华写道：“圣诞节前夕在这个空军基地上和另一个工作日的前晚一样”。美国佩刀式喷气机在圣诞节日还要到朝鲜北部去，而
    “死亡隐藏在北朝鲜的天空中”。“驾驶员们不谈这些，也不谈他们明天要飞行的任务。他们所谈的是家乡，等待着他们的妻子和正在学着走路和说话的孩子们”。
