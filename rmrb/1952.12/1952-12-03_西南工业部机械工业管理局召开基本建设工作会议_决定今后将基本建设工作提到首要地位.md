The Mechanical Industry Administration of the Southwest Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee convened its first Capital Construction Work Conference from November 10th to 14th. The conference exchanged and summarized work experience, and, based on the needs of national economic construction, decided to give capital construction work top priority in the future.

The meeting pointed out that the capital construction work of the Southwest mechanical industry sector has had many problems in the past three years. Engineering design, construction organization, material supply, and financial systems have been very chaotic. Leading cadres at all levels only focus on production and do not pay attention to the leadership of capital construction work, believing that with money they can build houses and install machines, and arbitrarily use production funds to engage in capital construction. Before construction, there is no overall plan, a lack of investigation, research, and careful planning and correct design, resulting in blindly starting work. Some units purchase equipment and start construction without the approval of higher authorities, resulting in a chaotic situation of work stoppages awaiting materials, and repairs, modifications, and demolition taking place simultaneously. For example, many projects of Factory 201 were just completed this year, but they will be demolished and repaired again when the factory is built next year. Factory 203 is building houses everywhere, but the houses built are not suitable for production needs, and the more they are repaired, the more chaotic they become. The dormitory project developed cracks as soon as it was completed. Some leading cadres do not provide leadership for capital construction projects, relying solely on old technicians and contractors, resulting in high project costs, poor quality, cutting corners, and serious corruption and waste.

In order to correct this chaotic situation and welcome the large-scale economic construction that is about to arrive, the conference decided that capital construction must be given top priority. Leaders at all levels must immediately correct the erroneous idea of not paying attention to capital construction, and transfer a large number of technical personnel from production departments to capital construction positions, concentrate talent, focus on use, and one of the factory director and deputy director must personally participate in the leadership of capital construction work. At the same time, we must fully prepare for capital construction work, understand the situation, analyze the situation, collect data, formulate plans, organize forces, carry out mobilization, and establish specialized institutions. Surveying and drilling must be carried out before design. Break the conservative thinking of technical personnel and tap potential. Strengthen planning management, implement the responsibility system, implement economic accounting, establish quotas, and promote the contract system.

    西南工业部机械工业管理局召开基本建设工作会议
    决定今后将基本建设工作提到首要地位
    西南军政委员会工业部机械工业管理局从十一月十日至十四日，召开了第一届基本建设工作会议。会议交流与总结了工作经验，并根据国家经济建设的需要，决定今后将基本建设工作提到首要地位。
    会议指出：三年来西南机械工业部门的基本建设工作存在着很多问题，工程设计、施工组织、材料供应、财务制度都很混乱。各级领导干部只重视生产，不重视对基本建设工作的领导，认为有钱就能盖房子，安机器，随意动用生产资金，乱搞基本建设。施工前没有全盘打算，缺少调查、研究和周密的计划、正确的设计，就盲目动工。有的单位根本不经上级批准就购器材，动工修建，以致造成停工待料、边修边改边拆的混乱现象。例如二零一厂很多工程今年刚完工，但明年开始建厂又要拆修。二零三厂到处盖房子，但盖的房子不适合生产需要，越修越乱，宿舍工程刚完工就裂缝。有的领导干部，对基本建设工程不加以领导，单纯依靠旧技术人员和包商，工程造价很高，质量差，偷工减料、贪污、浪费现象严重。
    为了纠正这种混乱现象，迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设，会议决定：必须把基本建设提到首要地位，各级领导必须立即纠正不重视基本建设的错误思想，从生产部门中抽调大批技术人员到基本建设岗位去，集中人材，重点使用，正副厂长必须有一人亲自参加对基本建设工作的领导。同时要充分作好基本建设的准备工作，了解情况，分析情况，搜集资料，订出计划，组织力量，进行动员，建立专门机构。设计前必须进行测量、钻探。打破技术人员的保守思想，发挥潜力。加强计划管理，贯彻责任制，实行经济核算，建立定额，推行合同制。
