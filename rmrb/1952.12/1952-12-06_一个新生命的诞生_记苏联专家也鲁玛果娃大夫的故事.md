The Birth of a New Life
—Remembering the Story of Soviet Expert Dr. Yerumagova

	One afternoon in early autumn of 1952, something like this happened in delivery room number one of the Central Hospital of the China Changchun Railway Administration in Harbin:

	The expectant mother Liu Shulan, who was nearly ten months pregnant, sat blankly on the bed and said to her husband painfully and sadly, "Ever since I got lumbago, I risked my life to have surgery when I gave birth to my first two children; it's a pity that both children were killed, which hurts more than cutting out my heart!" She coughed softly twice, paused for a moment, and said, "This time, maybe we two won't be together anymore..." At this point, her eyes were wet, and two round teardrops fell on her husband's hand. Her husband stroked her loose hair and comforted her, "Don't think wildly. It doesn't matter, there are Soviet experts here, and they will protect your life and our child's life."

	After consulting with Liu Shulan, Soviet expert and director of obstetrics Dr. Yerumagova and other doctors determined that her pelvis was deformed due to lumbago, and she could not deliver normally; she also had heart disease and tracheal asthma. Based on the diagnosis, a craniotomy should be performed to sacrifice the baby and save the mother's life. However, Dr. Yerumagova thought at the time, "No, we can't do this. I am a doctor sent by Stalin. Liu Shulan's husband is already in his thirties, and this child is related to the offspring and love of their husband and wife; although there are difficulties, we should find a way to save this child."

	After several thorough studies, she decided to perform a cesarean section to save the baby. Liu Shulan was approaching her due date, and some doctors advocated performing the surgery that day. Dr. Yerumagova explained, "We can't do this. One more day the baby stays in the womb, it will increase the child's health. We must think about the child's health!"

	The next day at noon, Dr. Yerumagova was about to go to dinner when Liu Shulan's stomach suddenly started to hurt. She hurriedly took off her coat, started to examine Liu Shulan, and then told the nurse to disinfect Liu Shulan and prepare for the operation. Liu Shulan was very scared when she was carried into the operating room. Dr. Yerumagova kindly comforted her in Chinese, "Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!" After Liu Shulan underwent general anesthesia, her asthma and heart disease became even worse, and her throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton, making "whirring" sounds. Dr. Yerumagova asked the nurse to inject Liu Shulan with the "Lubei Lin" that she had prepared in advance to help her breathe, and then injected her with a cardiac stimulant twice. Dr. Yerumagova quickly performed the surgery on Liu Shulan and removed the fetus. The baby was infected by the mother's anesthesia, his body was a little blue, and he couldn't cry. He had already passed out. Dr. Yerumagova, who had never been anxious, became anxious when she saw the baby not crying. She was doing the surgery and couldn't save him herself, so she quickly told the midwives Xu Xueqin and Jima Yewa to quickly inject the child with Lubeilin and camphor oil that she had prepared in advance, and then perform artificial respiration. As soon as Dr. Yerumagova finished suturing the abdominal incision, the baby room heard a loud cry, and a few wrinkles immediately appeared on the corners of her eyes and mouth... Soon after, she ran over, looked at the newborn baby from left to right, and said happily, "Child! I wish you good health!" This is an ordinary language, but it contains such a deep internationalist love!

	It was getting dark, and Dr. Yerumagova was still busy recording the operation process. The nurse urged her to go back for dinner, and she said with a smile, "Not busy! Not busy!" When she was about to get off work, she repeatedly told the nurse, "When Liu Shulan wakes up, tell her that she gave birth to a fat son, so that she will be happy!" At nine o'clock in the evening, Dr. Yerumagova came to see Liu Shulan again. Liu Shulan held the doctor's hand tightly, although the two of them could not express their feelings to each other in words; but through their hands and eyes, they expressed what they wanted to say in their hearts. Finally, Dr. Yerumagova said kindly, "Helao Shao (meaning good), fat boy!"

	In the short two years in the obstetrics department of the Central Hospital of the China Changchun Railway Administration, Dr. Yerumagova performed 97 cesarean sections and other operations for women with her tireless, Bolshevik spirit, saving the lives of many mothers and babies. On weekdays, she took care of the mothers meticulously, and the mothers affectionately called her "Old Big Sister" or "Mom."

	Dr. Yerumagova's love for the Chinese people is not only reflected in this. She is very concerned about the technology of Chinese doctors. She used her spare time to help Chinese doctors and midwives learn seven advanced Soviet medical technologies such as "Livanoro Artificial Delivery Method," "Painless Delivery Method," and "Arterial Blood Transfusion Method," and also trained seven excellent midwives.

	On November 7th this year, Dr. Yerumagova returned to her country. On her last day of work in China, she still inspected the wards on time. When she walked into the baby room, she saw that the nurse was not there, so she guarded the baby herself. When the nurse came back, she said kindly and seriously, "Take care of the children, they are all masters of building a communist society!"

    一个新生命的诞生
    ——记苏联专家也鲁玛果娃大夫的故事
    一九五二年初秋的一个下午，在中长铁路管理局哈尔滨中央医院一号产房里，发生了这样一件事情：
    妊娠将近十个月的产妇刘淑兰呆呆地坐在床上，痛苦而忧郁地对她的丈夫说：“自从得了腰腿疼病，生前两个孩子时，我冒着性命危险动了手术；可怜两个孩子都被弄死了，这比割我的心还疼！”她轻轻地咳嗽了两声，稍停了一会儿，说：“这回咱俩口子，也许不会再在一起过了……。”这时，她的眼圈湿润了，两颗圆圆的泪珠儿掉在她丈夫的手上。她丈夫抚摩着她的散发，安慰她说：“不要胡思乱想。不碍事，这里有苏联专家，他们会保全你和我们孩子生命的。”
    苏联专家、产科主任大夫也鲁玛果娃和别的大夫们给刘淑兰会诊后，确定她因腰腿疼使骨盘变形，不能正常分娩；又有着心脏病和气管喘息病。根据诊断，应该施行穿颅碎胎手术，牺牲婴儿，保住产妇性命。可是，也鲁玛果娃大夫当时想：“不，不能这样做，我是斯大林派来的医生。刘淑兰的爱人已是三十多岁的人了，这孩子关系着他们夫妻的后代和爱情；虽然有困难，我们应想办法拯救这个孩子。”
    经过几度周密的研究，她决定剖腹取胎拯救婴儿。刘淑兰已快到产期，有的大夫曾主张当天就动手术，也鲁玛果娃大夫解释说：“不能这样做。婴儿在母胎里多一天，就会给孩子增加一分健康。我们要为孩子健康着想！”
    第二天中午，也鲁玛果娃大夫刚要去吃饭，刘淑兰的肚子突然疼起来了。她急忙脱下大衣，动手给刘淑兰检查，然后，告诉护士为刘淑兰消毒，准备动手术。刘淑兰被抬进手术室时，非常害怕。也鲁玛果娃大夫用中国话亲切地安慰她说：“不要怕！不要怕！”刘淑兰实行全身麻醉后，喘息病和心脏病更厉害起来了，嗓子眼像塞上了棉花套子，“呼噜”、“呼噜”直响。也鲁玛果娃大夫让护士把事先准备的“鲁背林”给刘淑兰打上，帮助她呼吸，又给她注射了二次强心剂。也鲁玛果娃大夫敏捷地给刘淑兰动了手术，取出胎儿。婴儿受了母亲麻醉的感染，身体上有点发青，不会啼哭，已经假死过去。从来未曾着过急的也鲁玛果娃大夫，看到婴儿不啼哭，倒急起来了。她正在做手术，不能亲自去救他，忙吩咐助产士徐雪琴、吉玛也娃赶快给孩子注射她预先准备好的鲁背林和樟脑液，然后实行人工呼吸法。也鲁玛果娃大夫刚缝完腹口，婴儿室传来呱呱的啼哭声，她的眼角和嘴角上立刻呈现出几缕笑纹……。不久后，她跑过去，左右端详着新生的婴儿，高兴地说：“孩子！我祝你健康！”这是一句普通的语言，但这里含着多么深厚的国际主义的爱啊！
    天快黑了，也鲁玛果娃大夫还忙着记手术经过。护士催她回去用饭，她笑嘻嘻地说：“不忙！不忙！”临下班时，她还再三嘱咐护士说：“刘淑兰醒过来时，马上告诉她生了个胖儿子，好叫她高兴！”晚上九点钟，也鲁玛果娃大夫又来看刘淑兰。刘淑兰紧紧握着大夫的手，虽然她们两人不能用语言向对方表达自己的感情；但通过自己的手和眼睛，把心里要说的话都表达出来了。最后，也鲁玛果娃亲切地说：“何劳少（好的意思），胖小子！”
    也鲁玛果娃大夫在中长铁路管理局中央医院产科短短的二年中，以不知疲倦的、布尔什维克的精神，给产妇们做了剖腹等手术九十七次，拯救了很多母亲和婴儿的生命。平日，她对产妇的体贴无微不至，产妇们都亲热地称她“老大姐”或“妈妈”。
    也鲁玛果娃大夫对中国人民的热爱不仅表现在这一点。她非常关心中国医生的技术。她利用业余时间帮助中国医生、助产士学会了“利娃诺路人工司产法”、“无痛分娩法”、“动脉输血法”等七种苏联先进医学技术，还培养出七名优秀的助产士。
    今年十一月七日，也鲁玛果娃大夫回国了。她在中国做最后一天工作时，仍是按时检查病房。当她走进婴儿室时，看见护士没有在，就自己守着婴儿。护士回来时，她亲切而严肃地说：“要关心孩子，他们都是建设共产主义社会的主人！”
