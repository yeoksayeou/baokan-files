The Tunisian question and the Moroccan question, currently under discussion at the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, are about the Tunisian and Moroccan peoples' accusations against France's heinous colonial rule and their struggle for independence and autonomy. Despite repeated obstructions by France and other colonial countries, this issue has finally been placed on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly due to the just support of the Soviet Union and the resolute advocacy of some Asian and Arab countries within the United Nations.

Tunisia and Morocco are two North African countries that have long been under French rule. In 1881, France forcibly occupied Tunisia and coerced it into signing a treaty that turned Tunisia into a colony. In 1911, France again occupied Morocco with its army, turning Morocco into its protectorate. For decades, the people of Tunisia and Morocco have groaned under a barbaric colonial system, living lives worse than beasts of burden. During the 70 years of French rule in Tunisia, 25 years were under martial law and 45 years under a police state. The state of martial law proclaimed in Morocco in 1939 has never been lifted. French soldiers could arbitrarily conduct "sweeping operations" against the people of Tunisia and Morocco. Many who demanded national independence were massacred, not even infants were spared. Under the reign of terror, the people of Tunisia and Morocco not only had no freedom of assembly and association, but even private gatherings were prohibited. In Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, anyone wearing a red felt hat (the military hat of the old African cavalry) or tying a red turban would be searched or arrested.

The fertile lands and abundant mineral resources of Tunisia and Morocco have enriched the imperialist robbers, but the people there live unimaginable miserable lives. Most of the workers in Tunisia and Morocco are engaged in manual labor, while technicians and senior staff are all Europeans. They are forced to work under inhumane production systems, toiling all day long without enough to eat. The living conditions of the workers are also extremely poor. In Casablanca, Morocco, 200,000 people live in five "tin can areas" made of scrap iron cans or gasoline drums. As for unemployed workers, they cannot even live in these tin can areas; they wander the streets until they starve to death. The living conditions of farmers and agricultural workers, who constitute the majority of the national population, are even more miserable. The most fertile land is occupied by the colonizers, and people who have lost their land die of starvation in large numbers. Agricultural workers working on French farms or in feudal landlords' homes work from sunrise to sunset every day, earning only one-fifth of what they need to survive.

During World War II, the tentacles of American imperialism reached into these two rich lands and began to turn them into their own military bases and raw material supply bases. The United States not only stepped up the construction of naval and air bases and stationed troops there, but also seized the positions of French monopoly capital, monopolized the production of strategic raw materials in Morocco, and plundered Tunisia's oil, while dumping large quantities of its surplus products into these two places. As a result, the people of Tunisia and Morocco suffered even more miserably. The large-scale construction of military bases by the United States caused more people to lose their land. Workers forced to build military bases for the United States had to work 14 or 15 hours a day, and the wages they received could not maintain a minimum standard of living. At the same time, the massive dumping of American goods in North Africa resulted in the bankruptcy of a large number of handicraft workers and small merchants. Under such heavy oppression, the people of Tunisia and Morocco were of course unable to enjoy any cultural life, and the vast majority of them were illiterate. In Tunisia, only one in seven children can attend school. In Morocco, nine out of ten children are illiterate and cannot attend school.

The people of Tunisia and Morocco are unwilling to live under this dark and miserable colonial rule, and they have chosen the path of resolutely fighting against the colonial system and feudal forces, and striving for independence and liberation. Since these two countries were conquered by French imperialism, this struggle has never stopped. After World War II, due to the vigorous development of the struggles of the Asian and North African colonial peoples for independence and liberation, the national liberation movements of the Tunisian and Moroccan people have also become more vigorous. Since January of this year, large-scale strikes and demonstrations have continuously erupted throughout Tunisia. The workers participating in the strikes are spread throughout the country, including dockworkers in Bizerte and Kelibia, miners in M'dhilla, and workers in the Ferryville arsenal. During the large-scale demonstrations held by the people, the French colonial authorities dispatched armed troops and police to carry out brutal suppression of the demonstrators, which was met with heroic resistance from the demonstrators. In some areas, organized people's armed forces have successively appeared, conducting guerrilla warfare against the French colonial troops, attacking sentry posts, police stations, and colonial army barracks. Farmers also participated in the struggle, blowing up bridges and railways, cutting off the transportation of the colonial troops suppressing the people, and helping the guerrillas fight. Merchants and handicraft workers held strikes, and students held hunger strikes and boycotts. Even Muslim women, who had always stayed at home, came out to participate in marches and gatherings. Morocco has also seen a series of large-scale strikes and demonstrations, especially the large-scale strike by workers at the largest American military base, Nouasseur, which directly dealt a powerful blow to the war preparations of American imperialism. On March 30th, the 40th anniversary of Morocco's acceptance of the "Protectorate Treaty," the Moroccan people turned this humiliating day into a day of struggle for national independence. On this day, demonstrations and strikes were held in Tangier, which was under international co-management, and in all cities of Morocco. The demonstrators in Tangier shouted slogans along the way, demanding national independence, and black紗（纱） was hung at the entrances of shops to protest against French enslavement.

At present, the characteristic of the Tunisian and Moroccan national liberation movements is that all classes are more united and organized in the struggle. They have formed broad united fronts around the Tunisian Communist Party and the Moroccan Communist Party, respectively. After the general strike in Tunisia on February 1st, the Communist Party, the Neo-Destour Party, the General Union of Tunisian Workers, the Farmers' Union, and the Handicraft Workers' Union issued a joint declaration, deciding to fight side by side for independence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Moroccan people are also organizing a broad national liberation front.

With the support of American imperialism, the French colonizers have adopted increasingly tyrannical measures to suppress the surging national independence movements of the Tunisian and Moroccan people. The French colonial authorities have promulgated decrees stipulating that every Tunisian who demands independence will be sentenced to more than five years in prison, and have sent in tank units, guards, and expeditionary forces, using tear gas, artillery fire, and jet aircraft to attack the unarmed people. Many patriotic people in Tunisia and Morocco have bled and sacrificed under the French colonizers' policy of massacre, but new forces are joining the struggle against oppression every day. On the other hand, imperialism has also adopted a series of divisive tactics to ease the crisis of colonial rule. The French colonizers have repeatedly promised the people of Tunisia and Morocco "internal autonomy" and "political reform," but they have repeatedly broken their promises. For example, in August 1950, France pretended to promise to promote "political reform" in Tunisia, but after sixteen months of negotiations, France went back on its word. Not only did the Tunisian people not see any signs of "reform," but they were subjected to more fierce suppression. Nationalist Prime Minister Chenik, leaders of the national movement, and communists were all exiled, and the French colonizers forcibly appointed Bakouche, a loyal lackey who was pro-French, as prime minister. Under the strong resistance of the people, the French authorities formulated a deceptive so-called "reform plan" in June of this year, but the Tunisian people will not be deceived again. Under the anger of the people, the King of Tunisia also refused to approve this plan. The ugly and barbaric behavior of the French colonizers has made the people of Tunisia and Morocco deeply realize that only by resolutely fighting against the evil colonial system and completely overthrowing this criminal rule can they achieve true liberation.

The heroic struggle of the Tunisian and Moroccan people has won the sympathy and support of peace-loving countries and people of capitalist countries, and has received enthusiastic support from Asian and Middle Eastern Arab countries in particular. People in Asian and Middle Eastern countries have launched strikes, demonstrations, and boycotts to express their support for the Tunisian and Moroccan people. Thirteen Asian and Arab countries have requested the United Nations to review the "Tunisian Question" and the "Moroccan Question" three times.

The barbaric measures of French imperialism in Tunisia and Morocco are contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Charter stipulates that the principle of equality and self-determination of peoples must be respected in non-self-governing territories, ensuring political, economic, social and educational progress, developing self-government and guaranteeing protection against ill-treatment. However, France has not only blatantly violated these principles, but has also launched wars against the people of Tunisia and Morocco. The United Nations should have stopped France's barbaric atrocities long ago, but the United Nations organization, which is controlled by the United States, has actually encouraged France's barbaric actions. When the Tunisian government requested the United Nations Security Council to review the Tunisian question in January of this year, the US-French imperialists instructed United Nations "Secretary-General" Lie to deny the legitimacy of Tunisia's accusations, and prevented Tunisian representatives from going to New York by canceling their passports. They also put pressure on the representatives of thirteen Asian and Middle Eastern countries, asking them to "temporarily not submit the Tunisian question to the Security Council." Under the repeated obstruction of French and American imperialism, the two proposals of Asian and Middle Eastern countries were vetoed. This is how despicable and shameless imperialism is in order to maintain its corrupt colonial rule.

However, imperialism will not be able to suppress the just struggle of the Tunisian and Moroccan people for independence and liberation after all. On the eve of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, Asian and Middle Eastern countries once again requested that the Tunisian and Moroccan questions be placed on the agenda, and received the firm support of the Soviet Union and other countries. This could not but greatly alarm imperialism. In order to ease this situation, the United States reversed its past policy and actually hypocritically voted in favor of discussing the Tunisian and Moroccan questions. The United States obviously did this out of compulsion. Therefore, after the French government expressed its dissatisfaction, the US government hurriedly stated: "The United States will support France when discussing the substance of this issue." The shameless faces of US and French imperialism have been fully exposed.

The United Nations must respect the independence demands of the people of these two countries and resolve the Tunisian and Moroccan questions in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. If French and American imperialism and other colonial countries continue to obstruct the reasonable resolution of this issue, they will inevitably become increasingly isolated in front of the people of the world and accelerate the final collapse of their colonial system.

    突尼斯和摩洛哥问题
    第七届联合国大会正在讨论的突尼斯问题和即将讨论的摩洛哥问题，是突尼斯、摩洛哥人民控诉法国罪恶的殖民统治、争取独立自主的问题，这一问题，虽然受到法国及其他殖民国家的一再阻挠，但是由于苏联等国的正义支持及联合国中一些亚洲及阿拉伯国家的坚决主张，终于列入了联合国大会的议程。
    突尼斯、摩洛哥是非洲北部两个长期被法国统治的国家。一八八一年，法国以武力侵占突尼斯，强迫签订了一项使突尼斯沦为殖民地的条约；一九一
    一年，法国又以军队占领摩洛哥，把摩洛哥变成它的保护国。几十年来突尼斯和摩洛哥人民一直呻吟在野蛮的殖民制度下，过着牛马不如的生活。突尼斯在法国统治下七十年，二十五年是在戒严令下，四十五年是在警察制度下；摩洛哥从一九三九年颁布的戒严令直到现在没有解除。法国的士兵可以任意对突尼斯和摩洛哥人民进行“扫荡战”，许多要求民族独立的人都遭到了屠杀，甚至婴儿也不能幸免。在恐怖统治下，突尼斯和摩洛哥人民不但没有集会结社的自由，就是私人集会也遭到禁止。在突尼斯首都突尼斯市内，一个人只要戴一顶红毡帽
    （非洲旧时骑兵的军帽）或结一条红头巾，都会受到搜查或逮捕。
    突尼斯、摩洛哥的肥沃的土地，丰富的矿藏养肥了帝国主义强盗们，但是那里的人民却过着难以想像的悲惨生活。突尼斯、摩洛哥的工人们，大部分都担任粗工，技术人员和高级职员则都由欧籍人充当；他们被迫在非人道的生产制度下工作，终日劳苦，不得一饱。工人们的居住条件也极端恶劣，在摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡城有二十万人住在由废铁罐或汽油筒搭成的五个“铁罐区”内。至于失业工人，则连这种铁罐区也住不着；他们流落街头，直至饿死。占全国大多数人口的农民和农业工人的生活情况更为悲惨。最肥沃的土地被殖民者霸占了，失去土地的人们成批地死于饥饿；在法国农场或封建地主家里工作的农业工人，每天从日出工作到日落，只能得到生活必需费用的五分之一。
    第二次世界大战期间，美帝国主义的魔手伸进了这两块富饶的土地，开始把它们变成自己的军事基地和原料供应地。美国不仅在那里加紧修建海空军基地、驻扎军队，而且夺取了法国垄断资本的阵地，垄断了摩洛哥的战略原料的生产，并掠夺了突尼斯的石油，同时把它各种过剩的生产品大量向这两个地方倾销。这样一来，突尼斯和摩洛哥人民的遭遇就更加悲惨了。美国大规模修筑军事基地，使得更多的人失去了土地；被迫为美国修建军事基地的工人每天要工作十四、五小时，所得工资不能维持最低的生活。同时美国货在北非大量倾销的结果，造成大量手工业者、小商人的破产。在重重的压迫之下，突尼斯和摩洛哥人民当然不能享受什么文化生活，他们绝大多数都是文盲。在突尼斯每七个儿童中只有一个能够上学。摩洛哥的孩子每十个人中就有九个不识字和不能上学。
    突尼斯、摩洛哥人民不愿在这种黑暗悲惨的殖民统治下过下去，他们选择了向殖民制度、封建势力坚决斗争，争取独立解放的道路。从这两个国家被法帝国主义征服以来，这种斗争就从没有停止过。在第二次世界大战以后，由于亚洲及北部非洲殖民地人民争取独立解放斗争的蓬勃发展，突尼斯与摩洛哥人民的民族解放运动也更加高涨了。从今年一月以来，突尼斯全国各地不断爆发大罢工和大示威事件，参加罢工的工人普及全国各地，包括比塞大、克莱脱的码头工人，买浦沙的矿工以及斐里维尔兵工厂的工人等等。在人民举行的大示威中，法国殖民当局出动了武装军队和警察向示威群众实行残酷的镇压，遭到了示威群众的英勇抵抗。有些地区已经相继出现了有组织的人民武装向法国殖民军队进行游击战，袭击岗哨、警察局以及殖民军的兵营。农民也参加了斗争，他们炸毁桥梁、铁路，切断镇压人民的殖民军队的交通，帮助游击队作战。商人和手艺工人则举行罢市，学生举行绝食罢课，就是一向家居不出的回教妇女，也出来参加了游行的行列与集会。摩洛哥也陆续发生声势浩大的罢工和示威运动，特别是在美国最大的军事基地——纳瓦西尔的工人的大罢工，直接给美帝国主义备战活动以有力的打击。今年三月三十日摩洛哥接受“保护国条约”四十周年纪念日，摩洛哥人民将这个屈辱的日子变成争取民族独立的斗争日。这一天，在国际共管的丹吉尔，在摩洛哥所有的城市都举行了示威和罢工，丹吉尔的示威群众沿途高呼口号要求民族独立，商店的门口悬挂黑纱表示抗议法国的奴役。
    目前突尼斯、摩洛哥民族解放运动的特点是各阶层在斗争中已更加团结和更有组织了，他们已经分别在突尼斯共产党和摩洛哥共产党的周围组成了广泛的统一战线。今年二月一日突尼斯总罢工后，共产党、新独立党、工会联合会，农民联合会，手工业者联合会发表联合宣言，决定并肩为独立而斗争。摩洛哥人民在共产党领导下也正在组织广泛的民族解放阵线。
    法国殖民者在美帝国主义支持下，对于突尼斯和摩洛哥人民澎湃的民族独立运动，采取了愈来愈蛮横的镇压措施。法国殖民当局曾颁布法令，规定每一个要求独立的突尼斯人将受到五年以上的徒刑，并且开来了坦克部队、禁卫队、远征部队，以催泪弹、炮火，喷气式飞机进攻徒手的人民。突尼斯、摩洛哥许多爱国志士在法国殖民者的屠杀政策下流血牺牲了，但是每天都有新的力量参加到反压迫的斗争中去。另一方面帝国主义又采取了一套分化的手法来缓和殖民统治的危机。法国殖民者曾多次允诺突尼斯、摩洛哥人民“内政自治”、“政治改革”，但他们都一次又一次地毁弃了自己的诺言。像一九五○年八月法国假意允诺在突尼斯推行“政治改革”，但在进行十六个月谈判之后，法国出尔反尔，突尼斯人民不但没有看到一点“改革”的影子，反而遭到更凶猛的镇压，民族主义者首相谢尼克、民族运动的领袖和共产党员都遭到放逐，法国殖民者并以强迫的手段另立亲法国的忠实走狗巴库士为首相。在人民的强烈反抗下，法国当局又在今年六月制定了一个欺骗性的所谓“革新计划”，但是突尼斯人民再不会受骗了。突尼斯国王在人民的愤怒下，也表示拒绝批准这个计划。法国殖民者的丑恶和野蛮行为，已经使突尼斯、摩洛哥人民深刻地认识到，只有坚决地向万恶的殖民制度进行斗争，彻底推翻这种罪恶的统治，才能得到真正的解放。
    突尼斯、摩洛哥人民的英勇斗争，得到了爱好和平的国家、资本主义国家人民的同情和支援，特别得到亚洲、中东阿拉伯国家的热烈支持。亚洲和中东国家人民都纷纷举行罢工、示威、罢课来表示对突尼斯、摩洛哥人民的支援。十三个亚洲和阿拉伯国家曾三次要求联合国审议“突尼斯问题”和“摩洛哥问题”。
    法帝国主义在突尼斯和摩洛哥的野蛮措施，是和联合国宪章的原则相违背的。联合国宪章规定：对于非自治领土必须尊重人民平等和自决的原则，保证政治、经济、社会及教育的进展，发展自治，并保障不受虐待。但是法国不仅悍然违反了这些原则，而且对突尼斯、摩洛哥人民发动了战争。联合国早就应该制止法国的这种野蛮暴行，但为美国所把持的联合国组织，实际上却怂恿了法国的野蛮行动。当今年一月中突尼斯政府要求联合国安全理事会审议突尼斯问题时，美法帝国主义便指使联合国“秘书长”赖伊否认突尼斯控诉的合法性，并以取消护照的方法阻止突尼斯代表到纽约去，而且对于亚洲、中东十三国代表也施以压力，要他们“暂不把突尼斯问题提交安全理事会”。在法、美帝国主义的一再阻挠下，亚洲中东国家的两次提案都遭到否决。帝国主义为维护腐朽的殖民统治，就是这样卑鄙无耻的。
    然而帝国主义终究不能压制突尼斯、摩洛哥人民要求独立解放的正义斗争。亚洲及中东国家在联合国第七届大会的前夕，又一次提出了要求将突尼斯、摩洛哥问题列入议程，并得到苏联等国的坚决支持。这不能不使帝国主义大为惊慌。美国为了缓和这种局势，一反过去的政策，居然虚伪的投票赞成讨论突尼斯、摩洛哥问题。美国这样做显然是迫不得已的，因此在法国政府表示不满之后，美国政府又急忙声明：“美国将要在讨论这一问题的实质的时候支持法国。”美、法帝国主义的无耻面目至此已暴露无遗了。
    联合国必须按着联合国宪章的原则，尊重这两国人民的独立要求，解决突尼斯、摩洛哥问题。法、美帝国主义及其它殖民国家，如继续阻挠这个问题的合理解决，它们就必然会在全世界人民的面前越来越陷于孤立，并加速它们的殖民体系的最后崩溃。
