Stop Existing Wars
——Speech at the Sixteenth Morning Session of the World People's Peace Congress
Guo Moruo, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates:

War is currently being waged in Asia. At this very moment as I speak to you, in Korea, in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaya, many people are shedding blood and losing their precious lives.

Therefore, please allow me to directly address the core of the issue. The kind-hearted people of the entire world are urgently demanding an end to the existing wars. We know that the good people of the United States share this urgent desire.

We have seen an Associated Press dispatch from San Francisco on November 13th: Mr. Roberts, a news analyst for the Associated Press, said he had received several letters, all from women. One of them, written by Mrs. Moore from Youngstown, Ohio, he considered to be a summary of all their letters. The letter read as follows:

“We had a whole carload of women who were all Democrats, but they voted Republican because they understood that Eisenhower would go to Korea and end the war. Carload after carload of women went there to vote for the same reason; so you don’t need to guess where Ike got his votes. Six million American women elected Ike with this sentiment.”

We believe this is very honest. The fact has already proven that General Eisenhower won many votes because of his ambiguous promise to "go to Korea to seek an end to the current Korean War."

This well-known and recent fact clearly demonstrates that the American people, like the people of the world, are urgently demanding peace and an end to existing wars.

Among the existing wars, the Korean War is, of course, the most serious threat to world peace.

This war, carried out under the banner of the United Nations and under the responsibility of the United States government, has been going on for two and a half years. The American army has exhausted unprecedentedly cruel methods in Korea. Except for the atomic bomb, all kinds of mass-killing weapons, bacteriological weapons, gas bombs, and napalm bombs have been used extensively. Since August of this year, the U.S. Air Force has been wantonly bombing 78 peaceful cities in North Korea. Anyone who has been to Korea to personally inspect the situation cannot fail to be shocked and consider it unprecedented in history. Delegates can see some of the true situation from the films and photos brought by the Korean and Chinese delegations. The cruelty of the disaster is truly beyond words and language to convey. What is it like on the front lines? Please allow me to give a recent example.

Recently, General Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, taking advantage of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly being held in New York, launched a major offensive from October 14th, the largest since October of last year. One of the most intense battle locations was at two hilltop positions near Shangganling, north of Jinhua, with a total area of only three square kilometers, located on the ceasefire line stipulated in the draft Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to seize these two positions, General Van Fleet mobilized the forces of two or more divisions, including the U.S. 7th Division and the Rhee Syngman army's 2nd Division, as well as more than 100 tanks, and even put the U.S. Eighth Army's artillery general reserve, which is not easily used, into battle, attacking continuously for more than a month. The number of shells fired averaged more than 24,000 rounds per day, with a maximum of nearly 300,000 rounds in one day. Aircraft sorties averaged 63 per day, with a maximum of more than 250 sorties in one day, dropping heavy bombs, with a highest record of more than 500 bombs in one day. As a result, it is said that the top of Shangganling was leveled by nearly two meters, and the rocks on the mountain were blasted into powder more than one meter thick.

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates: Please consider, how many such astonishing records have there been in the history of world warfare? Some of you may be concerned, what happened to those two hilltop positions? It is somewhat miraculous. Despite the U.S. military's offensive for more than a month, with more than 20,000 casualties, replacing troops and generals, replacing the U.S. 25th Division with the 7th Division, replacing Rhee Syngman's 9th Division with the 2nd Division, and dismissing the commander of the 2nd Division, those two hilltop positions are still in the hands of the Korean and Chinese defenders. Therefore, the U.S. military believes that "the Jinhua campaign has become a bottomless pit"; an Associated Press message on November 2nd also stated that "it seems to be just expenditure and no income."

In fact, not only is the Jinhua campaign "a bottomless pit," but the entire Korean battlefield is also "a bottomless pit" for armed interventionists. In more than two years of war, the direct consumption of the U.S. side has reached $20 billion, and the number of casualties is equally staggering. The U.S. Department of Defense announced on December 10th that the total number of U.S. military casualties was 127,658. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press report on the 13th of this month: The total number of UN forces casualties is 364,370. Of course, these figures are not true. If based on the statistics of the Korean and Chinese sides, the difference is very large. According to the joint communique of the Korean and Chinese Supreme Headquarters, from October 25, 1950, to October 15 of this year, the total number of "UN forces" casualties has reached more than 660,000, of which the total number of U.S. military casualties is nearly 300,000.

Therefore, the Korean War is indeed a serious issue, and it is deeply related to the interests of the people of the world. It is not without reason that the American people are deeply concerned. It is not without reason that the kind-hearted people of the world are deeply concerned and have long called for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Like the peace-loving people of the world, the Korean and Chinese people have always been ardent lovers of peace. In order to defend their homeland and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, the Korean and Chinese people had no choice but to resist the armed intervention of the United States in Korea. After the American plan to annex Korea was shattered and the American army retreated to the 38th parallel, although the issue of Korean unification had not yet been resolved and although China's Taiwan was still under American occupation, the Korean and Chinese people, in order to meet the peaceful demands of the people of the world, were the first to respond to the Soviet proposal and agreed to hold Korean armistice negotiations.

On the American side, because the war was not proceeding as easily as the American generals had estimated, and due to the pressure of world opinion, the U.S. government also accepted the proposal for Korean armistice negotiations on July 10th of last year.

However, regrettably, the U.S. government and generals did not have the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. During the negotiations, they created difficulties in everything, deliberately complicated the issues, and did everything possible to delay and obstruct them; and they constantly used provocations and threats to undermine the agreements in the neutral zone of the conference and used so-called "military pressure" to indiscriminately bomb peaceful construction and peaceful residents. What is especially infuriating is that after their "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive" failed last year, they actually used the Korean and Chinese people as targets of bacteriological weapons. This crime, despite continuous and serious protests from peace-loving people around the world, international organizations, scientists, and religious figures with a sense of justice, and especially after the investigation by the International Scientific Commission, which has already issued a very detailed report to the world, has not yet been stopped even now.

Over the past year, the U.S. military has played countless tricks. However, in order to satisfy the urgent demands of the people of the world and to enable the Korean issue to be resolved peacefully on a fair and reasonable basis, the Korean and Chinese sides have maintained great composure and patience from beginning to end, adhered to principles, and conducted negotiations. After more than a year of firm effort, the negotiating parties have already reached agreement on 63 draft articles of the "Armistice Agreement." The negotiating parties have even completely prepared the text details. As soon as this draft "Armistice Agreement" is signed, the disaster in Korea can be stopped immediately, and American soldiers, British soldiers, French soldiers, and soldiers from other countries participating in the Korean War will no longer have to suffer thousands of casualties every week. However, the American side does not have the slightest interest in doing so. They deliberately created a new obstacle, which is to refuse to resolve the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with current international treaties.

Here, please allow me to review the issue of prisoner repatriation, which has been delayed for a year without reaching an agreement. In fact, this is a non-issue. According to international practice and international laws of war, especially the 1949 Geneva Conventions, both sides in a conflict should immediately and completely repatriate prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, and prisoners of war shall not renounce the right to be repatriated. The same provisions are clearly written in Articles 51 and 54 of the "Armistice Agreement" draft, which has already been agreed upon by both parties. Article 51 states: "All prisoners of war held by each side at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible. The release and repatriation of such prisoners of war shall be carried out in accordance with the lists exchanged and verified by both parties before the signing of this Armistice Agreement." Article 54 also states: "Within this period (referring to within two months after the Armistice Agreement takes effect), each party shall be responsible for completing the repatriation of all prisoners of war under its custody as soon as possible within its capabilities." However, the U.S. military does not want to abide by these conventions and agreements that they have personally formulated. They have created various excuses on the issue of prisoner repatriation. Initially, they proposed the "principle of one-for-one repatriation"; later, in order to sound better, they changed it to "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation"; and most recently, at the United Nations General Assembly, they changed it again to "non-forcible repatriation." It is said that some prisoners of war do not want to return to their home countries, and the U.S. military cannot use force to compel them to return, but must respect their "free will." In order to create some facts, the U.S. military conducted so-called "screenings" among the captured Korean and Chinese personnel, that is, who is willing to be repatriated and who is not willing to be repatriated. As a result, unprecedented atrocities of large-scale killings of captured personnel in prisoner of war camps such as Geoje Island and Jeju Island, which shocked the world, were created. Because the U.S. military used a large number of Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek agents among the captured Korean and Chinese personnel to coerce the captured Korean and Chinese personnel to write blood oaths, put fingerprints, or tattoo their bodies against their motherland, expressing "unwillingness to be repatriated." When the captured personnel resisted and refused to comply, the U.S. military used violence to suppress and slaughter them. Thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war died as a result. The truth about these atrocities has already been exposed to the world, not only by the admissions of Brigadier General Colson and Brigadier General Dodd, former heads of U.S. prisoner of war camps, by reports from countless British and American news agencies, and by reports from escaped prisoners of war, but even by the "International Committee of the Red Cross," which is trusted by the U.S. government, which had no choice but to admit that it was a true fact.

The excuse of respecting the "free will" of prisoners of war is completely ridiculous. If the U.S. government and generals truly respect the free will of people, why not respect the will of the 30 million people of Korea and let them solve their own problems? Therefore, the American so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" is actually forced detention. However, from the time the American side proposed this principle of "voluntary repatriation" in violation of international conventions in April to the end of October, the UN forces have suffered 176,626 casualties on the battlefield, of which 77,093 were Americans and 5,300 were British, Canadian, French, Turkish, and other troops. On average, 25,232 UN forces, 11,013 Americans, and 757 British, Canadian, French, Turkish, and other troops were injured or killed each month. For several months, all indications on the Korean battlefield have proven that if the armistice is not immediate and the U.S. military's offensive is allowed to continue, then the number of casualties for the UN forces will increase month by month, rather than decrease month by month.

The U.S. side has already paid such a heavy price in order to forcibly detain 33,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

Why does the U.S. government still insist on this attempt? It is very obvious that it is because the U.S. government and generals fundamentally do not have the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis, but are only interested in maintaining, continuing, and even expanding the Korean War. They know that the Korean and Chinese sides will not accept their absurd proposition of using force to undermine international conventions and humanitarian principles, and they are using this as an excuse to delay the war and deliberately create international tensions in order to intensify their arms expansion and war preparations. The more the United States intensifies its arms expansion and war preparations, the more some countries influenced by the United States lose their sovereignty, independence, and economic interests, and the more abundant the profits of the American billionaires become.

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 1949, before the Korean War broke out, the profits of U.S. companies were $27.6 billion. When the war broke out at the end of June 1950, the annual profits jumped to $41 billion. In 1951, it rose again to $42.9 billion. The year 1952 has not yet ended, but according to the "Economic Yearbook" published by the U.S. President's Council of Economic Advisers, it is estimated to reach $46 billion. This is the fundamental reason why the U.S. government does not welcome a ceasefire. But what benefits does this bring to the American people, apart from the large number of casualties on the battlefield? Look at the total profits of American companies in 1938, which was $3.3 billion. By 1951, it had increased to $42.9 billion, a thirteen-fold increase. At the same time, the direct tax burden of the American people, comparing the years 1952-1953 and 1937-1938, has also increased twelve-fold. Does this not prove that "the wool comes from the sheep"?

Some kind-hearted international friends seem to not quite understand this underlying issue. They feel that in order to reduce bloodshed, it seems possible to accommodate the proposals of the U.S. government and generals. If this is done, then they will be fooled by the U.S. government and generals.

The events of twenty years ago are worth recalling. In those years, the authorities of some countries adopted a policy of appeasement towards the various actions of Hitler and Japanese militarists that violated international conventions and humanitarian principles. What was the result? The result was the outbreak of World War II, which sacrificed the lives of tens of millions of people and lost immeasurable wealth. The severe wounds of war have not yet healed in many countries to this day.

The people of Korea and China have deeply learned from this historical lesson, because they were the main victims of the policy of appeasement towards Japanese militarism. They have suffered prolonged and deep pain, so they cannot yield to the unreasonable demands of the U.S. government and generals today. Concession will inevitably lead to the expansion of the war and cause even greater disasters to the world.

The U.S. government and generals harbor the intention of prolonging and expanding the war, which is not only revealed in their attitude towards the prisoner of war issue in the Korean armistice negotiations, but also clearly revealed in their entire world policy. They have long been actively pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparations, which is well known. Take the U.S. military expenditure as an example. The U.S. direct military expenditure in the years 1937-1938 was $1 billion, accounting for 14 percent of the total budget, while in this year, that is, the years 1952-1953, it has reached $58.2 billion, accounting for 74 percent of the total budget. The U.S. government is also expanding military bases everywhere, concluding military alliances, and rudely infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of other nations; arbitrarily implementing blockades and embargoes, thereby implementing monopolies and lowering prices, causing the production and economic situation of other countries to fall into crisis; and in the West, fostering the remnants of Nazi Germany, and in the East, fostering the remnants of militarist Japan, wanting to drive them as vanguards of a third world war, preparing to "use Asians to fight Asians, and use Europeans to fight Europeans."

It is in view of these overly obvious facts that not only the people of the Eastern countries who have suffered deeply from disasters have long been highly vigilant about the war policy of the U.S. government, but also many people in Western countries who have not fully recovered from the disasters of World War II are becoming highly vigilant. We have seen that the American magazine "Collier's" published an article by its Paris-based correspondents Ferdinand and Richardson on October 18th, entitled "No matter what we do, foreign countries do not like America." It said: "Throughout Western Europe, the United States has become the target of fierce attacks by the non-communist population, causing every American who hears these attacks to feel shocked, bewildered, and anxious." The article also cited many practical examples. I think my Western friends must know more clearly than I do, so I don't want to say more here.

It is the efforts of the people of Korea and China over the past two years that have struck a blow to the attempts of the U.S. government and generals on the Korean battlefield and curbed the expansion of the war. However, the U.S. government and generals have not given up on this and have not shown any sincerity in stopping the war. The attitude of the Korean and Chinese people on the prisoner of war issue is correct and just. The resolution of the prisoner of war issue can only be based on the Geneva Conventions and can never be based on any other principle that violates international conventions. If the U.S. government can change its attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war and strictly abide by the full repatriation provisions of the Geneva Conventions that it has personally signed, so that the prisoner of war issue can be resolved very satisfactorily, that is naturally what all fair-minded people in the world earnestly hope for. If the U.S. government insists on its attempt, then the Korean and Chinese people cannot give in and absolutely cannot yield. Because concession and yielding would encourage the U.S. government to use force to undermine international conventions and humanitarian principles, and would encourage the U.S. government to use armed intervention to undermine the sovereign independence of other countries. If a country can arbitrarily tear up international conventions that maintain international order and arbitrarily abandon its international obligations and responsibilities without being subject to any sanctions, then the disasters suffered by the Korean and Chinese people today may fall on the heads of the people of any other country in the world tomorrow.

Currently, the armistice negotiations have fallen into a stalemate, and the bloodshed in Korea has not stopped. The whole world is deeply concerned about this issue. Therefore, the issue of Korean armistice has also been heatedly discussed at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and there are as many as eleven proposals submitted individually or jointly by various countries. But these can be roughly divided into two categories. The first category is to put the armistice issue aside and hold onto the prisoner of war issue. Although they formally affirm that prisoners of war should be fully repatriated in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Conventions, and even say that they do not approve of the principle of "voluntary repatriation," on the other hand, in substance, they still propose "avoiding force in repatriation or return home" and advocate allowing prisoners of war to express their wish to "refuse repatriation" to neutral countries. They pretend to forget that these two propositions, which are absolutely mutually exclusive in logic, cannot coexist. They advocate handing over prisoners of war from both sides to a committee composed of neutral countries, instead of directly handing them over to the other party for protection. They disregard that after the captured Korean and Chinese personnel are handed over to the neutral country committee, the U.S. side can use agents mixed among the prisoners of war to coerce prisoners of war who have been tattooed or fingerprinted and have left marks of shame and cannot avoid having concerns. They also advocate handing over prisoners of war to the supervision of the United Nations. They simply ignore that the United Nations is one of the belligerent parties in the current Korean War. It is especially strange that such a major issue is like a judgment in absentia, without the participation of representatives from Korea and China. Therefore, we can clearly point out that these proposals are nothing more than disguised American proposals. They not only cannot achieve the purpose of stopping the current war and resolving the prisoner of war issue, but will be used by the U.S. government and generals and help them to carry out their purpose of prolonging and expanding the Korean War – in fact, they have already been used. The second category is to advocate an immediate cessation of all military actions and leave the prisoner of war issue to be resolved reasonably. This type of proposal can be represented by the Soviet proposal. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky successively suggested on November 10th and 24th: In accordance with the draft armistice agreement that has already been agreed upon by both parties, immediately and completely cease fire; the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to a "Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue" composed of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Korea; this committee should immediately take measures to resolve the Korean issue in the spirit of the Korean people themselves unifying Korea under the supervision of the committee. The decisions of this committee must be approved by more than two-thirds of the members to be valid.

This suggestion is reasonable and the governments of both Korea and China have agreed to this suggestion one after another. The spirit contained here is to replace military solutions with peaceful consultation. Today, mechanical majority cannot solve the problem. We must fully and reasonably consult repeatedly to obtain the consent of both parties, so that the problem can be resolved fairly and reasonably. The committee's decision must be approved by more than two-thirds to be valid, and the intention is here. Some may suspect that this will make the problem difficult to solve? Yes, adopting the method of consultation requires great patience. But fortunately, military operations have ceased first. In this situation, the disaster has stopped spreading, and everyone can continue negotiations peacefully. As long as both parties have the sincerity to solve the problem, the problem cannot be solved.

Unfortunately, the United Nations rejected the Soviet proposal with a mechanical majority.

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates: The problem is clearly placed before us. Is it to cease fire first and leave the prisoner of war issue to be resolved reasonably, or to use the prisoner of war issue as a shield and postpone the Korean ceasefire to a distant future? Is it to respect international conventions and fully repatriate prisoners of war, or to use various violence, create various excuses, and forcibly detain prisoners of war? Is it to resolve the problem fairly and reasonably in the spirit of consultation, or to use a voting machine to embellish the unreasonable as "reasonable"? Is it to take care of the happiness of the vast majority of people, or to only value the profits of a very small number of people? We must make wise criticisms of these.

World opinion is powerful. A year and a half ago, the power of world opinion prompted the start of armistice negotiations. Today, if our congress, based on the strong desire for peace of the people of the world, launches a greater force of world opinion, we believe that we can certainly promote an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

I have said a lot about the Korean War. Please allow me to briefly mention the situation of the Vietnam War and the Malayan War.

The Vietnam War has been going on for six years. The French public calls it a "dirty war," indicating that the French people do not support this war and have long demanded that this war be stopped.

As everyone knows, after the old Japanese imperialism launched the Pacific War, it was the Vietnamese people who, after a long and arduous struggle, liberated themselves from the iron hooves of the Japanese imperialists. Through the agreement of March 6, 1946, and the provisional agreement of September 14, the French government had agreed to the independence of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh. However, they later betrayed these agreements and launched the war.

Mr. Plevin of France once said in July 1950, "What France is doing in Indochina is exactly the same as what the United States is doing in Korea. This is the two wings of a front." This shows that this war, like the Korean War, fully has the danger of expanding into a world war. And the cruelty of this war is in fact no less than that of the Korean War. Here, the methods of killing all, looting all, and burning all are being used in the same way; napalm bombs and incendiary bombs are destroying a large amount of property. Vietnamese people, Cambodian people, and Laotian people are being massacred village by village. Although a large number of people have died, the French army has also suffered 220,000 casualties in the six-year war, of which 140,000 are European and African soldiers. It is said that the number of French officers killed on the Vietnamese battlefield is more than the number trained by the French military academy each year.

This war is being continued with the support of the U.S. government. By the end of 1951, the military expenses helped by the United States had already been 2.2 billion U.S. dollars. According to the report of the British "Observer" weekly on June 15, in 1952, the funds that the United States assisted France in "conquering" Vietnam will reach 450 million U.S. dollars. Our respected Pierre Gotte once said: "Without the help of the United States, the war in Vietnam would have ended long ago."

This war has encountered the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people, like the people of the world, also love peace. Of course, they do not want war, they are just forced to take up arms to defend their right to survival and national independence. As long as foreign armed intervention does not stop, the Vietnamese people's struggle to defend their freedom and independence will not end. Their struggle is part of the great movement to defend world peace.

The situation in Malaya has also attracted the attention of peace-loving people.

Malaya is also the Malayan people who rescued themselves from the Japanese imperialists. However, since June 1948, the British government has launched a war against the Malayan people. In this war, Britain dispatched nearly 400,000 troops, police, and various new types of aircraft and other weapons. For more than four years, 7,000 Malayan people have been detained without trial, more than 26,000 people have been deported, and 500,000 people out of a population of 6 million have been concentrated and controlled in more than 400 so-called "new resettlement villages," blocked by electrified barbed wire.

Our respected friend Mr. Montague gave a report at the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference on October 7 of this year. He announced some of the things that happened in Malaya – destroying crops, using chemical weapons, completely destroying rural property, collective punishment, torturing prisoners, and insulting the dead. These events have been boasted about by the authorities responsible for implementing them.

What is so-called "collective punishment"? This is the brutal act of suppressing the Malayan people invented by the current British High Commissioner to the Federation of Malaya, Mr. Templer. In order to not get the military intelligence he wanted from the peaceful residents of the countryside, Mr. Templer punished all the people of the entire village, even razing the entire village to the ground and moving all the residents of the village to concentration camps. Among these disaster-stricken villages, names such as Yue Rong Mailing and Bai Ma Tang Ding Yi are already known to many European friends. In Mr. Montague's words, "These heroic villages can be immortalized alongside Lidice."

Mr. Templer has gained the title of "Tiger of Malaya" for brutally suppressing the Malayan people. It is probably not very glorious to become a tiger. It is a bit hard to believe that this gentleman and his superiors belong to the same nation as Shakespeare, Bacon, and Newton, these great figures.

But after using such cruel methods, what is the result? Not very good. Templer himself said: As long as one-tenth of the population cooperates with him, he will easily win the battle. Will some people really cooperate with him? If there were, he might not have invented the method of "collective punishment." People are always people. People are always willing to deal with people, and are unwilling to deal with tigers.

We can understand why the British government is waging this war and making it last for more than four years. Because it produces rich strategic materials, that is, nearly one-half of the world's rubber and more than one-third of the world's tin. It is said that Malaya is the British government's "dollar mint." The profits of British tin and rubber companies are quite large, having increased sevenfold since 1948. However, good times do not last long. Due to the destruction of the war, the excessive cruel exploitation, the reduction of labor productivity, the closure of factories, coupled with the blows of the American embargo policy and price control methods, this "dollar mint" is already crumbling.

In short, the Malayan War is also being carried out under the support and control of the U.S. government. It is not supported by the British people, nor is it supported by all peace-loving people around the world.

Peace-loving people all over the world have been urgently demanding an immediate cessation of current wars.

As early as December 15, 1949, the Executive Bureau meeting of the "Standing Committee of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace," the predecessor of the World Peace Council, held in Paris, mentioned in the "Declaration for World Peace" that "The wars of aggression being waged in Malaya and Vietnam must be stopped. With international support, direct negotiations can make this matter realized."

After the outbreak of the Korean War, the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw also called for the peaceful end of the Korean War and the cessation of the Vietnam War in the "Appeal to the United Nations Organization" passed on November 22, 1950.

The World Peace Council, which was produced at the Warsaw Congress, has made resolutions on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the plenary meetings of the Council in February, November 1951 and July 1952. At the meeting in November 1951, it also made a resolution on the issue of Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing in October 1952 also made a resolution on the Korean issue, and also repeatedly mentioned in the "Letter to the People of the World," "Letter to the United Nations," and "Resolution on the Issue of National Independence" to stop the Korean War and end the wars in Vietnam, Malaya, and other regions.

These resolutions are still valid today, especially the principles on which these resolutions are based are the truths universally recognized by the people of the world - that is, to replace military solutions with a spirit of consultation and immediately stop the war; to respect each other's national independence and autonomy and withdraw all foreign troops; to abide by international conventions and international practices and resolve disputes on a fair and reasonable basis; to respect the principles of humanitarianism, to prohibit and stop the use of weapons of mass destruction, the arbitrary destruction of peaceful cities, and the massacre and forced detention of prisoners of war.

Based on these resolutions and principles, today, in solving the problem of current wars, we believe that:

All land, sea, and air military operations in Korea should be stopped immediately and completely; the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to a Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue to be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Conventions; all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be withdrawn, and the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully.

All military operations in Vietnam and Malaya should be stopped immediately and completely, foreign troops should be withdrawn, and the problems of Vietnam and Malaya should be resolved peacefully.

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates: The eyes of tens of millions of people in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are watching us, and millions of parents in various countries whose children are fighting in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are anxiously waiting for our conference to help them restore family happiness. We have a responsibility to satisfy the common aspirations of the vast majority of humanity.

Stopping today's wars can prevent even bigger wars tomorrow.

    停止现有战争
    ——在世界人民和平大会十六日上午会议上的发言
    中国代表团副团长  郭沫若
    主席先生，各位代表先生：
    战争，目前在亚洲进行着。在我对各位作报告的这一瞬间，在朝鲜，在越南、高棉、寮国，在马来亚，都有不少的人在流血，在失掉他们的宝贵生命。
    因此，请让我直截了当地说到问题的核心上来。全世界善良的人民都在迫切地要求停止现有的战争。我们知道：美国的善良的人民也同样具有着这个迫切的要求。
    我们曾看到美联社旧金山十一月十三日的电讯：美联社新闻分析家罗伯茨先生说他接到好几封信，都是妇女写给他的。其中有一封是俄亥俄州杨斯顿的摩尔夫人写的，他认为这封信正好像是她们所有信的摘要。信里写着这样的话：
    “我们一起有一整车的妇女，她们都是民主党人，但是投了共和党的票，因为她们的了解是，艾森豪威尔将到朝鲜去结束战争。一车接一车的妇女到那里去投票，都是为了同样的理由；所以你不需要去推想艾克从哪里得到他的选票。美国六百万妇女都是在这样的心情下选举艾克的。”
    这话，我们相信，是非常诚实的。事实已经证明：艾森豪威尔将军是因为他的“要到朝鲜去寻求结束现行朝鲜战争”的模棱两可的诺言而赢得了很多的选票。
    这一世界共知的新鲜事实明白地表明：美国人民和全世界人民一样，是迫切地要求和平，要求停止现有战争的。
    在现有战争中，威胁世界和平最严重的当然是朝鲜战争。
    这个在联合国的旗帜之下，由美国政府负责进行着的战争已经延续了两年半了。美国军队在朝鲜用尽了空前未有的残酷手段，除掉原子弹之外，所有各种大量杀人的武器，细菌武器、毒气弹、凝固汽油弹，都大量使用了。自本年八月以来，美国空军对朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市狂轰滥炸，凡是到过朝鲜去亲自视察过的人，都没有不惊心动魄，认为是史无先例的。各位代表可以从朝鲜代表团和中国代表团所带来的电影和照片中，看出一部分的真情实况。那灾难的残酷实在是不能用文字和言语来传达的。在前线上是怎样呢？请让我举出一个最近的例子。
    最近，美国第八军军长范佛里特将军趁着联合国第七届大会在纽约开会的期间，从十月十四日起，发动了一次自去年十月以来的最大攻势。有一处战事最激烈的地点是在金化以北上甘岭附近的两个山头阵地，总面积只有三平方公里，正在朝鲜停战协定草案所规定的停战线上。范佛里特将军为了要夺取这两个阵地，他发动了美军第七师和李承晚军第二师等两个多师的兵力，一百多辆坦克，还把不轻易使用的美军第八军炮兵总预备队也投入了战斗，一连进攻了一个多月。发射的炮弹，平均每天二万四千多发，最多的一天将近三十万发，飞机出动平均每天六十三架次，最多的一天是二百五十多架次，投掷的重磅炸弹，最高的纪录一天达到了五百多枚。这样，据说上甘岭的山顶削平了几乎两公尺，山上的岩石被轰成为一公尺多厚的粉末。
    主席先生，各位代表先生：请想想，世界战争史上究竟有过多少次这样惊人的纪录？各位或许会耽心吧，那两个山头阵地究竟怎样了？说来有点类似奇迹。尽管美军进攻了一个多月，伤亡了两万多人，换兵撤将，把美二十五师替换第七师，把李承晚第九师替换第二师，把二师师长免了职，然而那两个山头阵地却依然在朝中守军手中。因此，美军方面认为“金化战役已经成了一个无底洞”；美联社十一月二日的消息也说到，“看来只是支出而已，不会有什么收入的”。
    其实不仅金化战役是“一个无底洞”，整个朝鲜战场对武装干涉者说来也就是“一个无底洞”。两年多来的战争中，美方的直接消耗已达二百万万美元，伤亡数字也是同样惊人的。美国防部十二月十日曾经宣布美军伤亡总数共一二七、六五八名。再据美联社本月十三日报道：联合国军伤亡总数三六四、三七○名，当然这些数字是不真实的，假如根据朝中方面的统计，则相差很大。根据朝中统帅部的联合公报，自一九五○年十月二十五日至本年十月十五日为止，“联合国军”伤亡总数已达六十六万以上，其中美军伤亡总数已近三十万人。
    因此，朝鲜战争的确是一个严重的问题，它和全世界人民的利益有深切的关联。美国人民有着深切的关心，不是没有来由的。全世界善良的人民，都有着深切的关心，并且早就呼吁着朝鲜问题的和平解决，也不是没有来由的。
    与世界爱好和平的人民一样，朝中人民是一贯酷爱和平的。为了保卫自己的国土，为了维护远东和世界的和平，朝中人民不能不抵抗美国在朝鲜的武装干涉。在美国吞灭朝鲜的计划被击破、美国军队退回到三八线之后，尽管朝鲜统一的问题还未解决，尽管中国的台湾仍在美国占领之下，朝中人民为了适应全世界人民的和平要求，却首先响应了苏联的建议，赞成举行朝鲜停战谈判。
    在美国方面，由于战争的进行没有如像美国将军们所估计的那么轻便，又由于世界舆论的压力，美国政府也在去年七月十日接受了朝鲜停战谈判的建议。
    然而遗憾的是美国政府和将军们并没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，在谈判进行当中，遇事刁难，故意把问题复杂化，极尽了拖延和阻挠的能事；而且不断用挑衅和威吓来破坏会场中立区的协议，并运用所谓“军事压力”，对和平建设和和平居民的滥施轰炸。尤其令人愤怒的是，他们在去年的“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”都失败之后，竟把朝鲜和中国人民作为了细菌武器的对象。这一罪行，尽管遭受到爱好和平的世界人民、国际组织、有正义感的科学家和宗教家们连续不断的严重抗议，特别是经过了国际科学委员会的调查，已有极翔实的报告书向全世界公布，但直到现在都还不曾终止。
    一年多来，美军方面所玩的花样是层出不穷的。但朝中方面为了满足全世界人民的迫切要求，使朝鲜问题得以在公平合理的基础之上和平解决，自始至终还是以极大的沉着和耐心，坚持原则，进行谈判。经过了一年以上的坚定努力，谈判双方业已达成了六十三款“停战协定”草案的协议。谈判双方连文字细节都已完全准备就绪了，只要这个“停战协定”草案一经签字，朝鲜的灾难便可以立即停止，美国士兵、英国士兵、法国士兵和其他参加朝鲜战争各国士兵也可以不再有每周成千成万的伤亡了。可是，美国方面却没有一丝一毫这样做的兴趣。他们就故意造出一个新障碍，这就是拒绝按照现行国际条约来解决战俘遣返问题。
    在这里请允许我检讨一下这个拖延了一年而得不到协议的遣俘问题吧。其实这根本是不成问题的一个问题。根据国际惯例和国际战争法规，特别是一九四九年日内瓦公约，交战双方在停止战斗之后便应立即全部遣返战俘，战俘不得放弃被遣返的权利。这同样的规定在双方已达成协议的“停战协定”草案第五十一和第五十四两款上也明白地写着。第五十一款说：“本停战协定生效时各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。此项战俘的释放与遣返须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之。”第五十四款也说：“在此期限内
    （按指停战协定生效后两个月内）各方负责在可能范围内尽早完成其收容下的全部战俘的遣返”。然而美军方面却对这些惯例和它们所亲手订立的公约和协定完全不想遵守。它们在遣俘问题上竟造出了种种藉口。起先是提出了“一对一遣返的原则”；继后为了说得更好听些便改为“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”；最近在联合国大会上又改成了“不以武力遣返”。据说在战俘中有不愿意回到自己祖国的，美军方面不能用武力强迫他们回去，要尊重他们的“自由意志”。为了造出一些事实，于是美军方面便在朝中被俘人员中进行所谓“甄别”，即谁愿意遣返与谁不愿意遣返。于是便造成了震动全世界的巨济岛与济州岛等战俘营中大规模虐杀被俘人员的空前暴行。因为美军方面在朝中被俘人员当中使用了大批李承晚、蒋介石的特务，胁迫朝中被俘人员写血书、打手印或在身上刺字反对祖国，表示“不愿遣返”，被俘人员抗拒不从，美军便用暴力弹压、屠杀。朝中战俘因此致死者，数以千计。这些暴行的真相，不仅由美军俘虏营前负责人柯尔生准将和杜德准将的自承，由无数英美通讯社记者的报道，由战俘逃亡者的报告，早已暴露于全世界；甚至连为美国政府所信托的“红十字国际委员会”也不得不承认是千真万确的事实了。
    尊重战俘的“自由意志”的藉口是完全可笑的，美国政府和将军们如果真正尊重人们的自由意志，为什么不尊重朝鲜三千万人民的意志，让他们自己解决自己的问题？因此，美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”或“不以武力遣返”，其实就是强迫扣留。然而自美国方面在四月间提出这个违反国际公约的“自愿遣返”原则以迄十月底，联合国军在战场上业已遭受了十七万六千六百二十六人的伤亡，其中美军为七万七千零九十三人，英、加、法、土等军为五千三百人。平均每月要伤亡联合国军二万五千二百三十二人，美军一万一千零十三人，英、加、法、土等军七百五十七人。几个月来，朝鲜战场上的一切迹象都证明：如果不立即停战而听任美军的攻势继续下去，那么，联合国军的伤亡数字将是一月比一月增加，而不是一月比一月减少。
    美国方面为了强迫扣留三万三千个朝中战俘业已付出如此沉重的代价。
    为什么美国政府却还要坚持这个企图呢？很显然，那是因为美国政府和将军们根本就没有在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，而只是对维持、继续乃至扩大朝鲜战争感到兴趣。他们明知朝中方面是不会接受他们这种以武力破坏国际公约和人道原则的荒谬主张的，他们就正好拿这为藉口来拖延战争，存心造成国际紧张局势，以便加紧其扩军备战工作。美国的扩军备战工作愈加紧，某些受美国影响的国家便愈益丧失其主权独立和经济权益，而美国的亿万富翁们的利润也就愈丰厚。
    根据美国商务部的资料，朝鲜战争发动前的一九四九年，美国公司的利润是二七六亿美元，一九五○年六月底战争发动，全年利润就一跃而为四一○亿美元，一九五一年再上升到四二九亿美元，一九五二年还没有终结，据美国总统的经济顾问委员会所发表的“经济年鉴”估计，可达四六○亿美元。这就是美国政府不欢迎停战的根本原因。但这对于美国人民除掉在战场上有大部伤亡之外，又还有什么好处呢？请看美国公司在一九三八年的利润总额吧，那时是三十三亿美元，到一九五一年的四二九亿美元，是增加到十三倍。与此同时，美国人民的直接税负担，把一九五二至一九五三年度和一九三七至一九三八年度比较起来，也增加到十二倍，这不是恰好证明“羊毛出在羊身上”的吗？
    有一些好心肠的国际朋友，他们似乎不大明白这个底细。他们觉得为了减少些流血的牺牲，对于美国政府和将军们的主张似乎也可以迁就一下。如果这样做，那就上了美国政府和将军们的当了。
    二十年前的往事值得我们回忆一下。当年对于希特勒和日本军国主义者违反国际公约和人道原则的种种行为，有好些国家的当局是采取了绥靖主义来迁就的。结果是怎样了呢？结果是卷起了第二次世界大战，牺牲了千千万万人民的生命，损失了不可计量的财富。惨重的战争创伤，在好些国家里面，一直到现在都还没有恢复。
    朝中两国人民是深深领受过这段历史教训的，因为他们就是对日本军国主义的绥靖政策的主要牺牲者。他们曾经遭受过长远而深痛的灾难，因此他们今天决不能向美国政府和将军们的无理要求屈服。屈服必将诱致战争的扩大，而使世界受更大的灾难。
    美国政府和将军们怀抱着延长和扩大战争的企图，不仅在他们对于朝鲜停战谈判的遣俘问题的态度中表露着，而且在他们所执行着的整个世界政策中也明显地表露着。他们很久以来便积极地执行着扩军备战的政策，这是人众皆知的。就拿美国的军费一项来说吧。美国的直接军费在一九三七年至一九三八年度是十亿美元，占预算总额百分之十四，而在本年度，即一九五二年至一九五三年度却已达到了五百八十二亿美元，占预算总额百分之七十四。美国政府更在四处扩充军事基地，缔结军事性的盟约，毫不客气地侵犯别民族的独立和主权；任意施行封锁禁运，从而实行垄断，压低价格，使别国的生产事业、经济情况陷入危机；而在西方扶植纳粹德国的残余势力、在东方扶植军国主义日本的残余势力，想驱使他们作为第三次大战的先锋队，准备“用亚洲人打亚洲人，用欧洲人打欧洲人”。
    就是鉴于这些过于明显的实际，不仅深受灾难的东方国家的人民对于美国政府的战争政策早就发生了高度的警惕，就是从二次大战的灾难中还没有充分恢复转来的西方国家，也有不少的人民在发生着高度的警惕了。我们曾经看到美国的“柯里尔”杂志，在十月十八日登载了该社驻巴黎记者费迪南和李查逊两位先生的一篇文章，题目是“不论我们如何做，外国都不爱好美国”。那里面说着这样的话：“在整个西欧，美国已成为非共产党人口头上激烈攻击的目标，使听到这些攻击的每个美国人都要感到震撼、惶惑与焦虑”。文章中还举出了不少实际的例子，我想西方的朋友们一定比我知道得更清楚，我不想在这里多说了。
    是朝中人民两年多来的努力在朝鲜战场上打击了美国政府和将军们的企图，遏制着了战争的扩大。然而美国政府和将军们并没有因此而死心，并没有因此而表现出有停止战争的诚意。朝中人民对于遣俘问题上的态度是正确的，也是正义的。战俘问题的解决只能以日内瓦公约为基础，而绝不能以任何其他违反国际公约的原则为基础。假如美国政府能够改变他的强迫扣留战俘的企图，而严格遵守他自己所曾亲手签过字的日内瓦公约的全部遣返战俘的规定，使遣俘问题能够很满意地解决，那自然是全世界一切公正人士所殷切期望的。假如美国政府一定要坚持他的企图，那朝中人民就无法让步，也绝对不能屈服。因为让步和屈服，就是鼓励美国政府使用武力破坏国际公约和人道原则，就是鼓励美国政府以武装干涉来破坏他国的主权独立。一个国家如果对于维护国际秩序的国际公约能够任意撕毁，对于它所业已承担了的国际义务和责任能够任意背弃而不受到任何制裁，那么今天朝中人民所受的灾祸，明天就可能落在全世界任何别的国家人民的头上。
    目前停战谈判业已陷于僵局，而朝鲜的流血并未停止，全世界都深切地关心着这个问题。因此，关于朝鲜停战问题最近在联合国第七届大会上也曾热烈地讨论过，各国所单独提出或联合提出的方案竟有十一种之多。但在这里面大抵可以分为两大类。第一类是把停战问题放在一边而胶持着遣俘问题。他们在形式上虽也肯定战俘应按照日内瓦公约的原则全部遣返，甚至说他们并不赞成“自愿遣返”的原则，但另一方面在实质上却仍然提出“在遣返或回家中应避免武力”，并主张允许战俘向中立国表示自己“拒绝遣返”的愿望。他们装着忘记了这两种在逻辑上绝对互相排斥的主张是不能同时并存的。他们主张将双方战俘都交给中立国所组成的委员会，而不直接交给对方保护。他们竟不顾及在朝中被俘人员被交到中立国委员会之后，美方就可利用混杂在战俘中的特务，对已被刺字或打手印因而留下耻辱痕迹和不免有所顾虑的战俘进行胁迫。他们还主张将战俘交与联合国监管，他们简直无视联合国就是目前朝鲜战争中的交战一方。尤其奇怪的是这样重大的问题竟像缺席裁判一样，并没有朝中两国代表参加。因此我们可以明确指出，这些提案不外是变相的美国方案，它们不仅不能达到停止现行战争、解决战俘问题的目的，反而会被美国政府和将军们利用了，并帮助他们遂行其延长和扩大朝鲜战争的目的——事实上是已经被利用了。第二类是主张立即停止一切军事行动，而把战俘问题留待合理解决。这一类的方案可以以苏联提案为代表。苏联外长维辛斯基在十一月十日和二十四日先后建议：按照双方已经协议的停战协定草案，立即完全停火；战俘全部遣返问题交由美、英、法、苏、中、印、缅、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜所组成的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决；这个委员会本着由朝鲜人民自己在该委员会监督下统一朝鲜的精神，立即采取解决朝鲜问题的措施。这个委员会的决议须有三分之二以上的同意始能成立。
    这个建议是合情合理的，朝中两国政府都已先后同意了这个建议。这里所包含着的精神，便是以和平协商代替武力解决。在今天，机械的多数是决不能解决问题的，必须尽情尽理地反复协商获得双方的同意，然后才能使问题得到公平合理的解决。委员会的决议必须有三分之二以上的同意始能成立，其用意也就在这里。有人也许要怀疑那样岂不使问题很不容易解决吗？是的，采取协商的方式是需要有很大的耐心的。但好在军事行动已先行停止了，在这样的情形下边，灾难已经停止蔓延，大家尽可以心平气和地继续谈判，只要双方有解决问题的诚意，问题是没有不能解决的。
    然而不幸联合国却又以机械的多数把苏联提案否决了。
    主席先生，各位代表先生：问题是很明显地摆在我们的面前，是先行停火而把遣俘问题留待合理解决，还是把遣俘问题作为挡箭牌而把朝鲜停火推迟到遥遥无期？是尊重国际公约全部遣返战俘，还是使用种种暴力、制造种种藉口而强迫扣留战俘？是以协商精神使问题公平合理地解决，还是以表决机器把不合理粉饰为“合理”？是照顾绝大多数人的幸福，还是只看重极少数人的利润？这些须得我们作出明智的批判。
    世界舆论是有力量的。一年半前，世界舆论的力量曾经促成了停战谈判的开始。在今天，我们的大会如果根据世界人民强烈的和平愿望，发动更大的世界舆论的力量，我们相信一定可以促使立即在朝鲜停战。
    关于朝鲜战争我已经说了不少的话，请允许我再简单地提到越南战争和马来亚战争的情况。
    越南战争已经进行了六年了。法国的舆论称之为
    “肮脏战争”，表明法国人民是不支持这个战争的，而且早就要求把这个战争停止。
    大家都知道，在旧日本帝国主义发动了太平洋战争之后，是越南人民经过了长期的艰苦的斗争，才把自己从日本帝国主义者铁蹄之下解放了出来。通过一九四六年三月六日的协定，和九月十四日的临时协定，法国政府已经同意了在胡志明主席领导之下的越南人民的独立。然而后来却背弃了这些协定而发动了战争。
    法国的普利文先生在一九五○年七月曾经说过
    “法国在印度支那所干的事情，是和美国在朝鲜所干的事情完全相同，这是一个战线的两翼”。这就表明这个战争和朝鲜战争一样，充分有扩大成为世界战争的危险。而这个战争的残酷性事实上也和朝鲜战争不相上下。在这里，杀光、抢光、烧光的办法
    一样在使用；凝固汽油弹、烧夷弹一样地在大量毁灭。越南人民、高棉人民、寮国人民整村整村地被屠杀，死的人数固然不少，然而法国军队在六年战争中也已经伤亡了二十二万人，其中有十四万人是欧、非籍的兵士。据说法国在越南战场上所死亡的军官，比法国军事学院每年所训练出来的还要多。
    这个战争是在美国政府支持之下延续着的，到一九五一年底为止，美国所帮助的军费已经是二十二亿美元。据六月十五日英国“观察者”周刊的报道，一九五二年度，美国援助法国“征服”越南的经费将达四亿五千万美元。我们所尊敬的皮尔·戈特先生曾经说过：“如果没有美国的帮助，越南的战争该早已结束了。”
    这个战争遇到了越南人民英勇的反抗。越南人民，正如全世界的人民一样，也是一样爱好和平的。他们当然不愿意战争，他们只是被迫不能不拿起武器来保卫自己的生存权利和民族独立。外国的武装干涉一天不停止，越南人民的保卫自由独立的斗争也就一天不会结束。他们的斗争是伟大的保卫世界和平运动的一部分。
    马来亚的情形，也同样的吸引了爱好和平的人们的注意。
    马来亚，同样是马来亚人民自己把自己从日本帝国主义者手中拯救出来的。然而自一九四八年六月开始，英国政府已经向马来亚人民发动了战争。在这个战争中，英国出动了将近四十万的军警和各种新式的飞机和其他武器。四年多以来有七千个马来亚人被拘禁着不加审讯，有两万六千多人已被驱逐出境，六百万人口中有五十万人集中管制在四百多个所谓“移殖新村”里面，被通了电流的铁丝网封锁着。
    我们所尊敬的朋友蒙塔古先生在本年十月七日在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上曾经作过一次报告，他曾宣布马来亚所发生的一些事情——破坏农作物，使用化学武器，彻底毁坏农村财产，集体处罚，酷刑虐待俘虏，污辱已死的人。这些事件曾经由负责执行的当局夸耀地自行表白过。
    所谓“集体处罚”是什么呢？这是现任英国驻马来亚联邦高级专员田普勒先生所发明的镇压马来亚人民的残暴行为。为了从乡村的和平居民中得不到所要的军事情报，田普勒先生便惩罚全体村庄的人民，甚至把全村夷为平地，把全村居民移到集中营去。这些遭灾的村庄中，如像月绒马林、白马塘·丁宜这些名字，欧洲的朋友多已经知道了。借蒙塔古先生的话来说，“这些英雄的村庄是可以和利台斯并垂不朽的”。
    田普勒先生由于残暴地镇压马来亚人民，已经取得“马来亚之虎”的称号。人而变成了虎总怕是不大光荣的吧。这位先生和他的上司们，竟会是同莎士比亚、培根、牛顿这些伟大人物属于同一个民族的，令人有点难得相信。
    但用尽那样残酷的手段之后，结果怎样呢？并不佳妙。田普勒自己说：只要有十分之一的人口和他合作，他就会容易地打胜仗。真的会有一部分人能同他合作吗？假使有，他或许不至于发明“集体处罚”的办法了。人总是人，人总是愿意同人打交道，而不愿意同老虎打交道的。
    英国政府为什么要进行这个战争而且使它延续到了四年以上，我们是能够了解的。因为这里出产着丰富的战略物资，即占全世界将近二分之一的橡胶和三分之一以上的锡。据说，马来亚是英国政府的
    “美元铸造厂”。英国的锡和橡胶公司的利润是相当大的，自一九四八年以来已经增加七倍。然而好景不常，由于战争的破坏，过度残酷的剥削，劳动生产力的降低，工厂的倒闭，再加上美国禁运政策与控制价格办法的打击。这座“美元铸造厂”已经是摇摇欲坠了。
    要之，马来亚战争同样是在美国政府支持与控制之下进行着的，它不为英国人民所支持，也不为全
    世界爱好和平的人所支持。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都迫切地早就要求着立即
    停止现行战争。
    早在一九四九年十二月十五日，世界和平理事会
    的前身“世界拥护和平大会常设委员会”在巴黎召
    开的执行局会议，在“争取世界和平的宣言”中已
    经提到“在马来亚、越南进行的侵略战争，必须停
    止。在国际支持之下，举行直接谈判，可以使这件
    事情得到实现”。
    朝鲜战争发动后，华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会
    在一九五○年十一月二十二日所通过的“致联合国
    组织呼吁书”中也早呼吁着朝鲜战争的和平结束和
    越南战争的制止。
    华沙大会中所产生的世界和平理事会，在一九五一年二月、十一月及一九五二年七月历届全体理事会议上，都曾经作出了关于和平解决朝鲜问题的决议。在一九五一年十一月的会议上更曾经作出了关于越南及东南亚问题的决议。
    一九五二年十月在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议也作出了关于朝鲜问题的决议，还在“告世界人民书”、“致联合国书”和“关于民族独立问题的决议”中也再三提到停止朝鲜战争，并结束在越南、马来亚及其他地区的战争。
    这些决议在今天依然是有效的，尤其是这些决议所根据的原则是世界人民所公认的真理——便是以协商精神代替武力解决，立即停止战争；相互尊重民族的独立和自主，撤退一切的外来军队；遵守国际公约和国际惯例，在公平合理的基础之上解决纠纷；尊重人道主义的原则，禁止并停止大规模毁灭性武器的使用、和平城市的任意毁灭及战俘的虐杀和强迫扣留。
    根据这些决议和原则，今天在解决现行战争问题上，我们认为：
    应该立即完全停止在朝鲜的陆、海、空军事行动；战俘全部遣返问题交由一个和平解决朝鲜问题委员会按照日内瓦公约的原则去解决；撤退一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，和平解决朝鲜问题。
    应该立即完全停止在越南和马来亚的一切军事行动，撤退外国军队，和平解决越南和马来亚的问题。
    主席先生，各位代表先生：朝鲜、越南、马来亚的几千万人民的眼睛正在注视着我们，成百万的有自己的子弟在朝鲜、越南、马来亚作战的各国父母们，正在焦急地期待着我们的大会帮助他们恢复家庭幸福。我们有责任满足绝大多数人类的共同愿望。
    停止今天的战争，就能制止明天的更大的战争。
