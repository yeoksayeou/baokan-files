    Consider Horticultural Design Issues in Large Building Design and Construction
    To the Editor: After a large building is completed, the horticultural work follows closely – arranging trees, flowers, lawns, etc. in the garden. I am engaged in horticultural work, and in the past three years, I have often found that many buildings do not consider horticultural design issues during the design and construction process, resulting in a waste of national resources. For example, some remove the good soil after excavating for the foundation and leave behind bad soil, broken bricks, rotten tiles, and lime residue; it is difficult to plant trees and flowers when arranging the garden. Some do not compact the soil after excavation, and the planted trees and flowers sink after watering. Some build flower ponds, but there are hidden ditches or electrical conduits underneath. Some build flower beds, but they are improperly elevated or have no drainage holes, making them unsuitable for planting flowers. Some install water pipes for watering flowers and grass, but the water volume is insufficient, or the distance is inappropriate and impractical. This results in the horticultural arrangement work requiring much more manpower and material resources.
    Therefore, I suggest to the building engineers that they should incorporate the opinions of horticultural technicians during the building design and construction to better take care of horticultural arrangement work.

    Editor's Note: The spirit of reader Cui Zhendi in caring about national construction is very good. The Ministry of Building Engineering of the Central People's Government believes that this suggestion is practical. The ministry has notified architects to study this and strengthen cooperation with horticultural technicians when designing general layout plans in the future.

### 在大建筑设计施工时应考虑园艺设计问题

    在大建筑设计施工时应考虑园艺设计问题
    编辑同志：一个大建筑完工后，紧跟着就要进行园艺工作——在庭园中布置树木、花卉、草坪等。我是搞园艺工作的，在近三年来的工作中经常发现很多建筑在设计施工时没有考虑园艺设计问题，因而造成浪费国家资财的情况。譬如，有的在修地基刨土后，把好土运走了，留下的是坏土和碎砖烂瓦石灰碴；在布置园艺时要种植树木花卉就很困难。有的刨土后没有打实，栽上树木花卉后，一浇水就沉下去了。有的建了花池，但花池下面却是暗沟或电线管子。有的修了花坛，但却高低不宜或无泄水孔，不宜栽花。有的安装了浇花草用的水管，但却水量不足或距离不宜，不合实用。这就使园艺布置工作中多化了很多人力、物力。
    因此，我向建筑工程师们建议：在建筑设计和施工时应吸收园艺技术人员的意见，以便更好地照顾到园艺布置工作。

    编者按：读者崔振弟这种关心国家建设工作的精神是很好的。中央人民政府建筑工程部认为这个建议是切合实际的。该部已通知建筑师们对此进行研究，并在今后设计总平面布置图时和园艺技术人员加强合作。
