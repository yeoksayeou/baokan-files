    The Victorious October
    Written Collectively by Journalists Accompanying the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea
    October on the Korean front was filled with joy. The glorious achievements of the new China in various fields and construction over the past three years; the historic victories won by the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army for the past two years; and the good news of the arrival of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, all brought tremendous encouragement and joy to the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the heroic Korean people fighting on the Korean front.
    The news of the delegation's arrival on the Korean front spread rapidly among the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the Korean people in the front and rear through radio, telegrams, telephones, and personal conversations. From the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, from the east coast to the west coast, welcoming crowds were everywhere; "Welcome the Dear Ones" pine gates were erected all the way to the front lines;
    Slogans such as "Welcome the People's Delegation from the Motherland" and "Salute the Great Chinese People" were plastered all over the steel battle lines; flowers and colored confetti flew all over the representatives; shouts of "Long Live the Motherland!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live General Kim Il-sung!" and "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship!" resounded throughout the fighting Korean landscape. Soldiers from many units carried the delegation representatives up high mountains, a great friendship merging in silent embraces.
    The delegation brought the achievements and sentiments of the Chinese people in all fields to the front lines, adding new warmth and joy to the front lines. Liu Yonghui, a worker representative from the Tianjin-Nanjing Railway, was often warmly embraced by many soldiers at the front. With gratitude, the soldiers said to him: "Elder Brother Worker, you have worked so hard!" When Shen Xingchao, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River, brought the news of the victory in harnessing the Huai River to a field hospital in a certain area, Jiang Fuxing, a wounded volunteer soldier whose home was in the Huai River basin, burst into tears of gratitude. Touching the model medal on Shen Xingchao's chest, he seemed to see the green wheat waves of his hometown. The desolate years of the past were broken through, and happiness began to descend on the people on both sides of the Huai River, how could he not be grateful and excited! Farmer representative Wu Jifa reported the figures of this year's bumper rice harvest on the front lines, which aroused even more joy among the soldiers, and the slogan "Salute the Farmer Brothers!" resounded in unison. Combat hero Zhao Yining excitedly said, "Comrades, our suffering at the front is valuable, let us stand more firmly on our positions and fight to protect the greater harvest of the motherland!" The Korean people also celebrated the achievements of the new China just like the Chinese People's Volunteers. At a banquet held by the headquarters of the Korean People's Army to welcome the delegation, Kim Sang-ho, a "Hero of the Republic" of Korea, especially raised his glass to celebrate the victory of the new China's construction. He said: "The strength of the new China strengthens the forces of the peace and democracy camp and further strengthens the confidence of our Korean people in winning the struggle for independence and freedom."
    The heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces used powerful counterattacks and tenacious blocking actions to create a glorious victory in October, annihilating more than 63,000 enemy troops. And they used this victory as a gift to the National Day of the new China, the second anniversary of the Volunteer Army's departure to fight abroad, and the welcoming of the delegation. On the night of October 1st, when the blue searchlights were interwoven over Tiananmen Square in the capital, and tens of millions of happy people were singing and dancing, a powerful counterattack began on the long Korean front as a gift to the National Day of the new China. In the first five days of October, the heroes of the Chinese and Korean People's forces annihilated more than 3,000 enemy troops. A Volunteer Army unit on the banks of the Sajuan River on the Kaesong front, 150 meters from the enemy, spent the night of National Day in the rain, gnawing on dry rations. When they counterattacked the enemy guarding Heights 86.9, demolitionist Zheng Dingfu looked northwest—towards the capital—and said: "The motherland must be very happy at this time! For the eternal happiness of the people of the motherland, comrades! I guarantee to open the road to victory, if I can't blow up the obstacles, I will climb on the barbed wire and ask everyone to pass over me!" In this battle, he blew up a ridge-shaped barbed wire fence set up by the enemy and also continuously blew up five bunkers, capturing five prisoners. Squad leader Huang Shuigui, who destroyed seven bunkers in a row, was seriously injured all over his body, and three first-aid kits could not stop the bleeding. But he insisted on not leaving the front line, he said to the soldiers in his squad: "Comrades, I can't charge, but I can still use firepower to support your advance!" On the night of October 6, when the first convoy of the delegation was speeding across the vast fields of Korea, the heroes of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, under the loud slogan of "Fight a victory to welcome the dear ones," occupied 21 enemy positions that night, annihilating more than 2,600 enemy troops. The troops fighting on the Shangganling front used the glorious victory of the counterattack to welcome the second anniversary of the Volunteer Army's departure to fight abroad. In the tenacious defense and active counterattack from October 14th to 26th, for thirteen days and nights, they annihilated more than 8,000 men from the US 7th Division and the puppet 2nd Division. On October 19, machine gunner Mou Xiaoyu, ammunition handler Wang Zaoqi, and Wang Siyou, in the critical situation where the enemy occupied the top of the tunnel, still stubbornly defended the tunnel entrance and relentlessly attacked the enemy. In the heated battle, they fired more than 10,000 bullets at the enemy continuously. When they were thirsty, they licked the wet stones on the tunnel wall. Until dusk that day, they also cooperated with the powerful counterattacking forces, annihilating more than 2,000 enemies in 20 minutes. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the Kaesong front launched a counterattack against the enemy guarding the nameless highlands next to 45.4 and 29.5 on the east bank of the Sajuan River when the delegation arrived at the unit. The soldiers carried the gifts given to them by the people of the motherland. The silk handkerchief wrapped the photo of Chairman Mao and put it in the close-fitting pocket; the enamel cup printed with the words "Presented to the Most Beloved Person" shined on their belts. The soldiers said: "Carrying these gifts is like having Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland by my side, and I feel more powerful all over!" Tankers with candy in their mouths drove tanks like steel torrents towards the enemy, and gunners hung the comfort bags on the cannons and spewed thousands of tongues of fire at the enemy. After only nine minutes, the victory signal rose, and the brave men annihilated more than 130 enemies, captured six prisoners, and seized many weapons. The representatives of the delegation, to thank the soldiers for their glorious contribution to peace and the motherland, also bravely rushed to the participating companies, presented the glorious red flag to the heroes, and toasted each of the warriors participating in the battle with a cup of victory wine.
    The commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army have presented the most meaningful and precious gifts to their loved ones from the motherland. The Volunteer Army unit that fought on the south bank of the Han River for fifty days and nights made handkerchiefs from the parachutes they had captured from the enemy and printed them with the determination of thousands of Volunteer Army soldiers:
    The nine red characters of "Defend Our Beloved Motherland" were presented to the delegation. The heroic troops defending Kaesong presented dozens of commemorative bags that had been prepared long ago to the delegation representatives who arrived at the unit. The commemorative bags contained photos of heroes and meritorious workers and many articles recording the heroic deeds. The soldiers of the fourth company of a certain unit presented the Volunteer Air Force hero Zhang Jihui's jet fighter remnants of the US aerial bandit Davis's jet fighter that was shot down by the Volunteer Air Force hero Zhang Jihui to the delegation in the form of a blue "jet fighter pipe" and a silver ashtray. They sewed the pipe on a piece of yellow satin and attached a picture, above which was a colorful picture of the hero Zhang Jihui and his silver swallow; below was a photo of Davis, the so-called "American ace pilot" with his hands stained with the blood of the Korean people, and the wreckage of his plane. Many Volunteer Army soldiers also presented the vegetables they had grown themselves during the battle intervals to the representatives of the people of the motherland. Among them were large cabbages weighing thirteen and a half kilograms, large radishes more than two feet long, and a large pumpkin specially dedicated to Chairman Mao. When the soldiers were still very young, they carved words on it: "The production performance on the battlefield is good, and the production of big melons cannot be eaten; this melon is round and round, and it is dedicated to Chairman Mao for remembrance."
    The Korean People's Army and the Korean people also presented many precious gifts to the delegation. Among the gifts presented to the delegation by the Korean Ministry of Internal Affairs Guard were vases made of American 60-mm mortar shells, lamp holders made of butterfly bombs, and refined desk gifts for both table lamps, pen holders, ink pad boxes, and inkwells made of artillery shells.
    Among the many gifts from the Korean people to the delegation, one gift deeply moved the delegation's representatives. This gift was the rice cakes presented to the delegation by the people of Gujili, Jinhua County. The rice used for these rice cakes was cultivated with the blood of Ren Tingchang, an outstanding son of the Chinese people—a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Ren Tingchang was killed by enemy artillery shells while helping the Korean people hoe the land. In order to mourn this immortal internationalist fighter, the Korean people used all the grain harvested from this land as seeds and will always sow them on the land of Korea.
    On the front lines and in the rear, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers expressed their firm determination to their loved ones from the motherland with fiery enthusiasm. The soldiers looked forward to the beautiful scenery of the motherland tomorrow and asked the delegation representatives to tell the people of the motherland: You can produce with peace of mind and step up the construction of our beloved motherland! We are determined to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army to the end to defend the construction of the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!
    The heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people are also deeply grateful for the love and care of the Chinese people. They asked the delegation representatives to convey the deep feelings of gratitude of all the Korean people to the great Chairman Mao Zedong and all the Chinese people: In the anti-aggression struggle for national independence and world peace, the Korean people will certainly care for the Chinese People's Volunteers like they care for their own children. They also wished the new China even more glorious achievements in the large-scale construction cause. (Xinhua News Agency)

    胜利的十月
    随中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团记者集体写作
    十月的朝鲜前线，到处喜气洋溢。新中国三年来各方面的胜利和建设上的光辉成就；中国人民志愿军两年来和朝鲜人民军并肩作战所获得的历史性的胜利，以及中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团来到朝鲜战地的喜讯，都给战斗在朝鲜前线的中、朝人民部队和英雄的朝鲜人民，带来巨大的鼓舞和喜悦。
    慰问团到达朝鲜前线的消息，从无线电里、电报里、电话里和人与人的交谈中，飞快地在朝鲜前线和后方的朝中人民部队和朝鲜人民中传开。从鸭绿江到三八线，从东海岸到西海岸，到处滚动着欢迎的人流；“迎接亲人”的松门，一直扎到前沿；
    “欢迎祖国人民慰问团”、“向伟大的中国人民致敬”的标语，遍布在钢铁战线上；鲜花和彩色纸屑飞满在代表们的身上；“祖国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”“中朝友谊万岁！”的口号声，响遍了战斗的朝鲜。许多部队的战士们，抬着慰问团代表爬上高山，伟大的情谊，交融在无声的拥抱中。
    慰问团把中国人民各方面的成就和心意带到前线，更给前线增添了新的温暖和喜悦。天兰路工人代表刘永会在前线常常被许多战士热烈地拥抱住。战士们怀着感激的心情对他说：“工人老大哥，你们真是辛苦了！”治淮模范申兴朝把治淮的胜利消息带到某地野战医院时，家住在淮河流域的志愿军伤员姜福兴感激得流出了眼泪。他摸着申兴朝胸前的模范奖章，仿佛看到了家乡绿油油的麦浪。多少年来荒凉的年代被突破了，幸福开始降临到淮河两岸人民的身上，怎不叫他由衷的感激和兴奋呢！农民代表邬纪发在前线报告了今年水稻丰产的数字，更加引起战士们的高兴，“向农民兄弟致敬！”的口号声响成一片。战斗英雄赵日英激动地说：“同志们，我们在前方的苦吃得是有价值的，让我们更坚强地站在阵地上，为保卫祖国更大的丰收而战斗吧！”朝鲜人民也和中国人民志愿军一样欢庆着新中国的成就。在朝鲜人民军总部欢迎慰问团的一次宴会上，朝鲜“共和国英雄”金尚浩特地举杯庆贺新中国建设的胜利。他说：“新中国的强大，就增强着和平民主阵营的力量，也更加增强我们朝鲜人民争取独立自由斗争的胜利信心。”
    英雄的中、朝人民部队用强力的反击战和坚强的阻击战，在十月份创造歼敌六万三千多人的光辉胜利。并以此胜利，作为对新中国国庆节，志愿军出国作战两周年和迎接慰问团的献礼。十月一日夜晚，当首都天安门上空交织着蓝色的探照灯光，千万欢乐的人们，正在载歌载舞的时候，在朝鲜漫长的战线上，作为对新中国国庆节献礼的强大的反击战开始了。在十月的头五天里，中、朝人民部队的英雄们，就歼灭了敌军三千名以上。开城前线砂川河畔的一支志愿军部队，在接敌一百五十公尺的前沿，啃着干粮，在大雨中度过了国庆节的夜晚。当他们向八六点九高地的守敌进行反击时，爆破手郑定福望着西北——首都的方向说：“祖国这时候不知多欢乐呢！为祖国人民的永远欢乐，同志们！我保证打开胜利的道路，如果万一我爆不开障碍，我就爬在铁丝网上，请大家从我身上通过！”就在这次战斗中，他炸开了敌人设防的一道屋脊形铁丝网，还连续爆破了五个地堡，抓了五个俘虏。连破七个地堡的班长黄水贵，全身负重伤，三个急救包也止不住殷殷的鲜血。但他坚持不下火线，他向他班里的战士们说：“同志们，我不能冲锋了，但我还可以用火力支援你们前进！”十月六日夜晚，当第一批慰问团的车队奔驰在朝鲜广阔的原野时，中、朝人民部队的英雄们，就在“打个胜仗迎接亲人”的响亮口号下，当夜占领二十一处敌军阵地，歼灭了二千六百多名敌人。战斗在上甘岭前线的部队，以反击战的光辉胜利来迎接志愿军出国作战两周年。他们在十月十四日至二十六日十三昼夜顽强的守备战和积极的反击战中，就歼灭了美七师和伪二师八千多人。十月十九日，机枪手牟孝玉、弹药手王早起、王四友在敌人占领坑道顶的危急情况下，仍坚守坑道口顽强地打击敌人。在火热的战斗中，他们曾连续向敌人发射一万多发子弹。渴了，就舔舔坑道壁上潮湿的石头。直到这天黄昏，他们还配合着强大的反击部队，在二十分钟内歼灭了二千多个敌人。开城前线志愿军某部，在慰问团到达该部时，即分别向砂川河东岸四五点四，二九点五旁两个无名高地的守敌发起反击。战士们带着祖国人民赠给他们的礼品。丝质的手帕裹着毛主席的像片，放在贴身的衣袋里；印有“赠给最可爱的人”的字的搪瓷杯在他们的腰带上闪闪发光。战士们说：“带上这些礼品，就好像毛主席、祖国人民都在我身边，浑身就增加了力量！”坦克手们嘴里含着糖驾驶着钢铁巨流般的坦克冲向敌人，炮手们则把慰问袋挂在炮身上，把千百条火舌喷向敌人。只过了九分钟，胜利的信号升起来了，勇士们歼灭了一百三十多个敌人，还抓了六个俘虏，缴获了许多武器。慰问团的代表们，为感谢战士们为和平和祖国所作的光辉贡献也英勇地赶到参战的连队去，把光辉的红旗献给英雄们，并向参加战斗的勇士们，每人敬上一杯胜利酒。
    志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们，纷纷把最有意义的珍贵礼物回赠来自祖国的亲人。曾在汉江南岸战斗五十昼夜的志愿军部队把他们亲手缴获敌人的降落伞做成的手帕，印上千万个志愿军战士的决心：
    “保卫我们可爱的祖国”九个红色大字，赠给慰问团。保卫开城的英雄部队把早就准备好的数十个纪念袋，赠给到达该部的慰问团代表。纪念袋里装着英雄、功臣的照片和许多记载英雄事迹的文章。某部四连的战士们，把志愿军空军英雄张积慧击落的美国空中强盗戴维斯驾驶的喷气式飞机残骸所做成的蓝色“喷气式烟斗”和银色的烟灰盒赠给慰问团。他们把烟斗缝在一块黄缎子上，同时还附有一张图片，图片的上方是英雄张积慧和他的银燕的彩色画面；下方贴着双手染满朝鲜人民鲜血的所谓“美国王牌驾驶员”戴维斯和他飞机残骸的照片。还有许多志愿军的战士们，把他们利用战斗空隙亲手生产的蔬菜献给祖国人民的代表。其中有十三斤半重的大白菜，二尺多长的大萝卜，还有一个专门献给毛主席的大南瓜。战士们当这个南瓜还结得很小时，就在上面刻上了字：“战地的生产成绩好，生产大瓜吃不了；这瓜长得圆又圆，献给毛主席作留念。”
    朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民也把许多珍贵的礼品回赠慰问团。朝鲜内务省警备队赠给慰问团的礼品中有用美式六○炮弹壳做成的花瓶，蝶弹做成的灯座，炮弹做成的台灯、笔架、印泥盒、墨水缸四用的精制的案头礼品。
    在朝鲜人民回赠慰问团的许多礼品中，有一件礼品，深深地感动着慰问团的代表。这件礼品就是金化郡古直里的人民赠给慰问团的米糕。这些米糕所用的大米，是中国人民优秀的儿子——中国人民志愿军战士任廷昌用鲜血培植起来的。任廷昌是在帮助朝鲜人民锄地时，被敌人的炮弹夺去了生命。朝鲜人民为了悼念这位不朽的国际主义战士，把这块土地上收获的粮食，全部当作种子，将永远播种在朝鲜的土地上。
    在前线和后方，英雄的中国人民志愿军战士们，以火一样的热情向祖国的亲人们表示他们坚强的决心。战士们憧憬着祖国明天的美景，纷纷请慰问团代表们转告祖国人民：你们尽管安心地生产，加紧地建设我们可爱的祖国吧！我们决心为保卫祖国的建设、保卫远东和世界和平，英勇地和朝鲜人民军并肩战斗到底！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，也深深地感激中国人民的热爱和关怀。他们请慰问团的代表们，把全朝鲜人民对中国人民感激的深情转达给伟大的毛泽东主席和全中国人民：在为祖国独立和世界和平的反侵略斗争中，朝鲜人民一定像关心自己的子弟一样来关心中国人民志愿军。他们并且预祝新中国在大规模的建设事业中，获得更光辉的成就。（新华社）
