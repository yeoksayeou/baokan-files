The Transformation and Growth of Factory 53
Dong Xin, Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Factory 53 is one of the advanced factories in Northeast China. Since resuming production in March 1949, the factory has overcome various difficulties and consistently exceeded the state plan for three years, despite a reduction in equipment, a gradual withdrawal of veteran workers, and a large increase in new workers. Taking the actual completion of various indicators in 1949 as 100, the total industrial output value (including increased production and savings) in 1952 reached 694, labor productivity reached 447, and costs were reduced by 41.85% compared to the planned costs in 1950. In 1952, in addition to completing the state plan, the factory also increased production and saved wealth equivalent to 52,000 tons of grain, completing 87.78% of the target by the third quarter.

With the development and improvement of production, the material and cultural life of the employees has also gradually improved significantly. Over the past three years, more than 1,700 issues related to technology, safety, and equipment have been resolved, ensuring safe production. The establishment of collective welfare facilities such as sanatoriums, chronic disease sanatoriums, clinic in the dormitory area, health canteens, nurseries, and children's schools, as well as the improvement of working conditions, have effectively protected the health of employees and solved their difficulties. Workers' wages and living standards have greatly improved. Taking the average worker's wage in 1949 as 100, it had increased to 177 by 1952. Comparing the average piece-rate wage income in 1952, it reached 285%.

Over the past three years, the factory has established a regular political, technical, and cultural learning system for cadres and the masses. Various training courses are regularly held for different types of learning. The trade union organization alone has held 36 various training courses. At the same time, there is also a strong organizational activity through the Party's propaganda network, with 316 propagandists and 157 propaganda activists in the factory. There are over a thousand people in broadcasting listening groups and newspaper reading groups. As a result, the class consciousness, cultural and technical levels of the employees have rapidly improved, and a large number of activists and cadres have been cultivated. The trade union organization alone has transferred 244 cadres to the Party and administrative departments, and over the past three years, the factory has transferred more than 230 cadres.

98% of the factory's employees participate in the trade union organization. Party members account for 9.12% of all employees, and Youth League members account for 22.75%. Although the number of Party members is not large, the Communist Party has extremely high prestige among the employees. Therefore, it can unite and lead all employees to overcome various difficulties, transform the old enterprise, establish a socialist management system, improve production, and create outstanding achievements. In the past three years, the leading cadres have also learned and mastered the basic methods of political and economic work in the enterprise. In order to absorb the successful experience of Factory 53, the growth process of the factory from an old enterprise to a socialist enterprise is roughly described in three stages as follows:

I. Democratic Reform

After Factory 53 came into the hands of the people in November 1948, it immediately began work on building the factory. In the early days of the takeover, employees had an unclear understanding of the current situation and the Party's policies, and their class consciousness was not high. There was a gap between workers and old staff members, and they were not active enough in their work. The old management structure and system were very unreasonable. In light of these circumstances, the factory first carried out basic class education on current affairs, policies, and historical materialism, which initially improved the political understanding of the employees. It established a trade union organization for the working masses themselves, mobilizing and organizing employees to actively participate in guarding the factory, moving the factory, building the factory, donating equipment, and restoring production. The factory then launched and organized a two-and-a-half-month "speaking bitterness" movement, using the masses' own experiences to educate them, so that they understood the roots of oppression, exploitation, and all suffering and disasters, and began to establish new labor attitudes. At the same time, the factory launched criticism and self-criticism between staff, technicians, and workers, eliminating the gap created by the ruling class in the past. Combined with labor insurance registration, it registered counter-revolutionary parties, enemy and puppet troops and police, and feudal secret societies, purged and punished counter-revolutionaries, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, purified the working class ranks, and adjusted personnel and unreasonable wage systems. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, organizations of the Communist Party and the Youth League were established, the trade union organization was expanded, the old structure was reformed, a new structure and work system were established, and a factory management committee was established to implement democratic management. After a series of work, the class consciousness of the employees was improved, labor discipline was strengthened, and the unity of the employees was also strengthened. Reliable backbones and activists emerged among the masses, reversing the situation of failing to complete production tasks, and then achieving completion and exceeding targets. Leading cadres also realized the great strength of the working class and further recognized the truth of relying on the working class to run the people's enterprise well. The democratic reform work created conditions for production reform ideologically and organizationally.

II. Production Reform

The factory implemented an economic accounting system from October 1949 to the end of the quality inspection in July 1951. This period was basically a stage of production reform. After democratic reform, although the class consciousness of the employees had been improved and production tasks had been overfulfilled, the products had not yet fully met the standards, the factory had not yet established a scientific management system, the production plan was not an advanced plan, and it could not be well grasped, cost accounting was very unreasonable, there was a lot of waste in production, and there was a supply system mentality. Therefore, production reform was the central task that could not be delayed at that time. The factory first carried out product finalization, improving the old specifications and standards of the products through several research experiments (some improvements had been made in the democratic reform stage) to become fully compliant with national regulations and standards. Then, it carried out an anti-waste accounting campaign, liquidating and overcoming serious waste phenomena in production. On this basis, a new record movement was launched, which greatly improved labor productivity. On the basis of the new record movement, the factory adopted the Soviet advanced method—technical measurement method—to set quotas, implemented quota management with average advanced quotas, formulated daily production plans, maintained balanced production in each process, implemented assembly line operations, achieved balanced and rhythmic production according to daily production plans, and shortened the production cycle. At the same time, the factory improved the wage system—implementing the eight-grade wage system, transitioning from a bonus system for over-fulfillment to a piece-rate wage system. It implemented a production responsibility system, thereby strengthening production management. It strengthened technical management, formulated and implemented technical operating procedures, machine maintenance and repair systems, technical inspection systems, and technical safety regulations. It conducted major safety inspections and strengthened labor protection work. According to Soviet advanced experience, it improved labor organization, adopted a production area system, improved the management organizations of various functional departments and workshops, and established detailed rules for various businesses. It implemented a three-level system from the factory director to the cadres directly in charge of production. On the basis of quota work, it formulated annual production, technology, and financial plans year by year according to the various indicators issued by the higher authorities. Before and after quota management, it carried out asset inventory, verified fixed assets and determined working capital, implemented an independent accounting system, and reached the indicators of working capital turnover times stipulated by the state, reasonably utilizing working capital and fixed assets. As quota management gradually improved, it progressed from factory cost accounting to workshop cost accounting, and then developed into workshop cost accounting, preparing conditions for team cost accounting. It improved cost management, overfulfilled cost plan reduction targets, and finally conducted a major quality inspection, thereby greatly improving product quality. It formulated and implemented duty regulations for technical personnel, revised various technical management systems, and comprehensively strengthened technical management. These measures further promoted production management and financial cost management. All of the above work was carried out by extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses, educating workers, technicians, and staff to cooperate closely, going deep into workshops and teams, and actively learning from Soviet advanced experience. Therefore, the various tasks of production reform were successfully completed, and socialist management methods of planned management and economic accounting system were realized. This fundamentally transformed the old enterprise.

III. Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to Tap Enterprise Potential

After democratic reform and production reform, production management, technical management, and financial cost management basically got on the right track. Leading cadres accumulated experience, and the masses' class consciousness, technical level, and business level gradually improved. However, the enterprise's potential had not yet been effectively and fully utilized. Product quality should continue to be improved. Regarding cost accounting, the factory had not yet carried out a comprehensive analysis to achieve effective control in advance, used to guide production, and promote a comprehensive reduction in costs. It had not yet more effectively utilized working capital. Therefore, further launching the increase production and practice economy movement to comprehensively improve the work became the central task of this period. The two increase production and practice economy movements in 1951 and 1952 tapped the huge potential within the enterprise, continuously improving product output and quality, continuously reducing costs, and ensuring the continuous accumulation of surplus profits. They continuously accelerated the turnover rate of working capital and saved state funds. They formulated material supply quotas, reserve quotas, and supply contracts between higher and lower levels, ensuring supply and shortening the reserve process of working capital. They rationally determined the standard turnover volume of products, shortening the production cycle and achieving a daily balance rate of over 95%. At the same time, they shortened the production process of working capital, and also shortened the circulation process of working capital. All of the above work was carried out by vigorously promoting advanced experience, extensively and deeply mobilizing employees to find tricks, tap potential, and put forward rationalization proposals. At the same time, the trade union and administrative departments signed collective contracts on schedule, giving the broad masses of employees clear goals to strive for, ensuring that the Party, administrative departments, trade union, and Youth League had consistent thinking and consistent actions. Therefore, they could most widely mobilize and organize the masses to overfulfill each state production plan and increase production and practice economy plan, creating a large amount of wealth for the state, and at the same time solving the labor protection and welfare problems of employees. Therefore, employees' working conditions and various welfare facilities have been gradually enriched and improved with the improvement of production.

Currently, in order to welcome large-scale economic construction and create higher profits for the state, the factory is striving for product standardization on the basis of successful trial production of new products. At the same time, it is further improving labor organization, improving equipment utilization, and actively preparing conditions for the mechanization of the production process.

The main reasons for achieving the above achievements are that the factory has clearly and specifically implemented the basic principle of relying on the working class to run the enterprise well and the comprehensive view of the trinity of production, life, and education. It has realized the unified leadership of the Party, administrative departments, trade union, and Youth League with the implementation of the state economic plan as the center, implemented the mass line, and established the correct relationship and normal working order between the Party, administrative departments, trade union, and Youth League. That is to say, administrative cadres, with the realization of the production plan as the center, not only promote the administrative management organization to carry out work, but also rely on the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations to educate and organize all employees to carry out work. In this way, in order to do a good job in production, the administrative departments must also educate administrative cadres to combine their work with actively carrying out political work, and transform the process of completing production into a process of educating and organizing the masses, so that the state plan can be transformed into a conscious action plan of the broad masses. On the other hand, administrative cadres must not only accurately understand the completion and problems of production, but also care about the specific situation of employees' lives and labor, and plan the measures to improve living and working conditions as an important part of the administrative plan, and effectively implement it.

The Party takes production as the center, and the cadres in charge of Party work firmly grasp the political and ideological leadership, not only to carry out general political and ideological education and improve the thinking of cadres, but also to ensure that political work effectively guarantees the realization of the state economic plan. The cadres in charge of Party work must study economic knowledge, study business, grasp the key to completing production, strengthen the leadership of the trade union organization, firmly grasp the ideological trends of employees, deeply carry out propaganda and mobilization work, improve the ideological awareness of employees, and organize employees to specifically implement the instructions and resolutions of higher authorities.

The trade union takes production as the center, and trade union cadres not only generally mobilize and organize the masses of employees to participate in production competitions, but also go deep into production, study the problems in production, grasp the key to completing production tasks, implement the Party's policy of protecting labor, assist the administrative departments in planning to improve and improve working conditions, and assist the administrative departments in holding necessary welfare undertakings needed by the masses on the basis of developing production, and gradually improve the lives of the masses. In this way, trade union cadres must go deep into the masses, accurately understand the urgent demands of employees in labor and life, and cooperate with the administrative departments to specifically improve them. The trade union should frequently reflect the problems in the production and life of the masses and various opinions and demands to the Party, analyze and study them in advance, and put forward opinions on solving these problems as a reference for the Party to deal with problems, so as to give play to the role of the trade union as a link between the Party and the masses.

The correct relationship between the Party, administrative departments, trade union, and Youth League is not only clarified ideologically, but also consolidated organizationally. First of all, under the unified leadership of the Party, they have a good learning system. Cadres above the workshop level of the Party, administrative departments, trade union, and Youth League study political theory and business knowledge for one hour every day. When receiving each work task, they also study according to the instructions of higher authorities and combine them with the specific situation of the factory, understand the Party's policies and ideas, and then determine the work guidelines and steps, unify the understanding of cadres, and implement them, adhering to it as one day for three years. In this way, cadres can always maintain consistent thinking and consistent steps on the basis of common progress. Secondly, leading cadres of the Party, administrative departments, trade union, and Youth League have "brainstorming meetings" every day to closely contact each other, exchange information, exchange experience, and deal with specific problems. Thirdly, there is criticism and self-criticism. From leading cadres to trade union groups, there is a strict system of criticism and self-criticism, which is regularly checked in conjunction with production and the central tasks of each period. They use the method of criticism and self-criticism to solve all contradictions, consolidate the combination of political work and economic work, and the combination of leadership and the masses, and promote the continuous progress of work.

    五三工厂改造和成长的过程
    中华全国总工会政策研究室副主任　董昕
    五三工厂是东北地区先进工厂之一。该厂自一九四九年三月恢复生产以来，在设备减少，老工人逐渐抽走，新工人大量增加的情况下，克服了各种困难，三年来一贯地超额完成国家计划。如以一九四九年实际完成各项指标为一○○，一九五二年工业总产量（包括增产节约）可达到六九四，劳动生产率可达到四四七，成本将比一九五○年计划成本降低百分之四一·八五。一九五二年除完成国家计划外，同时还可增产节约五二、○○○吨粮食的财富，截至第三季度已完成百分之八七·七八。
    随着生产的发展与提高，职工的物质文化生活也逐渐得到很大的改善。三年来解决了有关技术安全设备事项一、七○○余件，做到了安全生产。业余疗养所、慢性病疗养所、宿舍区门诊所、保健食堂、托儿所、子弟学校等集体福利设施的建立，以及劳动条件的改善等，都切实地保护了职工的身体健康与解决了职工的困难。工人工资与生活水平大大提高。如以一九四九年工人平均工资为一○○，一九五二年已提高到一七七，如以一九五二年平均计件工资收入相比较，则达到百分之二八五。
    三年来该厂建立了干部与群众正规的政治、技术、文化学习制度。并经常举办各种训练班进行各种学习。仅工会组织就举办了三十六次各种训练班，同时还有党的强大的宣传网的组织活动，全厂有宣传员三一六名，宣传员积极分子一五七名，广播收听组与读报组有千余人，因而职工的阶级觉悟、文化、技术水平迅速提高，培养了大量积极分子和干部。仅工会组织就向党与行政输送了干部二四四人，三年来全厂调出去的干部达二百三十余人。
    全厂职工百分之九十八参加了工会组织。党员占全体职工百分之九·一二，团员占全体职工百分之二二·七五，虽然党员数量不大，但共产党在职工中有极高的威信，因而能够团结与领导全体职工克服各种困难，改造了旧企业，建立了社会主义的经营管理制度，提高了生产，创造了优越的成绩。领导干部也在三年来的工作中，学习与掌握了企业中的政治工作与经济工作的基本方法。为着吸取五三工厂的成功经验，现将该厂从一个旧企业改造为社会主义性质的企业的成长过程，大致按三个阶段简述如下：
    一、民主改革
    五三工厂从一九四八年十一月归人民之手以后，立即进行建设工厂工作。在接收初期，职工对当前形势与党的政策认识不清，阶级觉悟不高；工人与旧职员间存在着隔阂，工作上也不够积极；旧的管理机构和制度很不合理。根据这些情况，该厂首先进行了时事政策及唯物史观等基本的阶级教育，初步提高了职工的政治认识；建立了工人群众自己的工会组织，动员与组织了职工积极参加护厂、迁厂、建厂、献纳器材、恢复生产等工作。该厂进而发动与组织群众进行了为时两个半月的诉苦运动，以群众自身的经历教育群众，使工人群众懂得了压迫剥削，以及一切痛苦和灾难的根源，开始树立新的劳动态度。同时，该厂开展了职员、技术人员与工人间的批评与自我批评，消除了过去统治阶级所造成的隔阂，并结合劳动保险登记，进行反动党团、敌伪军警、封建会门的登记，清洗与惩办了反革命分子，分清了敌我，纯洁了工人阶级队伍，调整了人事与不合理的工资制度。在发动群众的基础上，建立了共产党、青年团的组织，扩大了工会组织，改革了旧的机构，建立了新的机构和工作制度，建立了工厂管理委员会，实行管理民主化。经过了一系列的工作之后，职工的阶级觉悟提高了，劳动纪律加强了，职工的团结也加强了，在群众中出现了可靠的骨干和积极分子，扭转了完不成生产任务的情况，进而做到完成与超过任务。领导干部也体会到了工人阶级的伟大力量，进一步认识依靠工人阶级办好人民企业的真理。民主改革工作从思想上组织上为进行生产改革创造了条件。
    二、生产改革
    该厂自一九四九年十月开始实行经济核算制，至一九五一年七月质量大检查结束，这一时期基本上是生产改革阶段。经过民主改革后，虽然职工阶级觉悟已经提高了，生产任务已经超额完成，但产品尚未完全达到标准，工厂还没有建立科学的管理制度，生产计划还不是先进的计划，也还不能很好掌握，成本计算很不合理，生产上浪费很大，存在着供给制的思想作风。因此进行生产改革，是当时刻不容缓的中心任务。该厂首先进行产品定型，把产品旧的规格标准经过若干的研究试验（在民主改革阶段中已做了某些改进），改进成为完全合乎国家的规定标准，接着进行反浪费算细帐，清算与克服了生产上的严重浪费现象。在这一基础上展开了新纪录运动，大大地提高了劳动生产率。在新纪录运动的基础上，该厂采用苏联先进方法——技术测定法进行定额，以平均先进定额实行定额管理，制定日生产计划，保持各工序平衡生产，实行流水作业，达到按日生产计划均衡地有节奏地生产，缩短了生产周期。与此同时，该厂改进了工资制度——实行八级工资制，由超额奖励制过渡到计件工资制；贯彻了生产责任制，从而加强了生产管理；加强技术管理，制订与贯彻了技术操作规程、机器保养检修制度、技术检验制度、技术保安规程等；进行保安大检查、加强劳动保护工作；按苏联先进经验改善劳动组织，采用生产区域制，健全了各职能科及车间管理组织，建立各项业务的办事细则；实行了从厂长到直接领导生产的干部的三级制。在定额工作的基础上，按上级颁发的各项指标，实行了逐年制订年度生产、技术、财务计划。在定额管理前后进行清理资产、核定固定资产与确定流动资金，实行了独立会计制度，达到了国家所规定的流动资金周转次数的指标，合理地运用了流动资金与固定资产。随着定额管理逐步改进，由厂成本计算进到车间成本计算，进而发展为车间成本核算，并为小组成本核算准备了条件，改进了成本管理，超额地完成成本计划降低指标，最后进行了质量大检查，从而大大提高了产品质量。制订与贯彻了技术人员职责条例，修订了各项技术管理制度，较全面地加强了技术管理。这些措施推动生产管理及财务成本管理更提高一步。以上这一系列的工作，都是通过广泛深入地发动群众，并教育工人、技术人员、职员密切合作，深入车间及小组，积极地学习苏联先进经验，因而顺利地完成生产改革的各项任务，实现了计划管理与经济核算制的社会主义的经营管理方法。这就从根本上改造了旧企业。
    三、开展增产节约运动发掘
    企业潜力
    经过民主改革、生产改革，生产管理、技术管理、财务成本管理基本上走向正轨，领导干部积累了经验，群众阶级觉悟、技术水平与业务水平也逐步提高，但企业的潜在力还未有效地全面发挥。产品质量还应继续提高；对于成本核算，该厂尚未进行全面分析，达到事先有效地控制，用以指导生产，促使成本全面降低；还没有更有效地运用流动资金。因此，进一步开展增产节约运动，把工作全面提高一步，就成为这一时期的中心任务。一九五一年及一九五二年二次增产节约运动，挖掘了企业内部的巨大潜在力，使产品产量、质量不断提高，成本不断降低，保证了超额利润的不断积累；不断加速流动资金周转率，节约了国家资金；制定了材料供应定额、储备定额和上下之间的供应合同，保证了供应，缩短了流动资金的储备过程。合理地确定了制品标准周转量，缩短了生产周期，达到了日均衡率百分之九十五以上；同时缩短了流动资金的生产过程；也缩短了流动资金的流通过程。所有以上这些工作，都是通过大力推广先进经验，广泛深入地发动职工找窍门、挖潜力，提合理化建议而开展起来的。同时，工会与行政按期签订集体合同，使广大职工群众有明确的奋斗目标，使党、行政、工会、青年团的思想一致，行动一致，因而能最广泛地发动与组织群众，超额完成每期国家生产计划与增产节约计划，为国家创造了大量财富，同时解决了职工劳动保护与福利问题。因此职工的劳动条件与各种福利设施都随着生产的提高，逐渐充实、完备。
    目前，为迎接大规模的经济建设，为国家创造更高的利润，该厂正在新产品试制成功的基础上，为产品标准化而努力。同时，进一步改善劳动组织，提高设备利用率，以及为着生产过程机械化而积极准备条件。
    取得以上成绩的主要原因，是该厂明确具体地贯彻了依靠工人阶级办好企业的基本方针及生产、生活、教育三位一体的全面观点；实现了党、行政、工会、青年团以实行国家经济计划为中心的统一领导，执行了群众路线，建立了党、行政、工会、青年团的正确关系和正常的工作秩序。这就是说行政干部以实现生产计划为中心，不仅推动行政管理机构进行工作，同时要依靠党、青年团、工会组织来教育组织全体职工进行工作。这样行政方面为了作好生产工作，也必须教育行政干部结合业务，积极进行政治工作，把完成生产的过程变成为教育、组织群众的过程，才能使国家计划变为广大群众的自觉的行动计划；另一方面行政干部不仅要确切了解生产完成的情况和问题，同时也要关心职工生活、劳动的具体情况，并把生活、劳动条件的改进措施计划成为行政方面计划的重要组成部分，并切实贯彻。
    党以生产为中心，党的工作的干部抓紧政治思想领导，不仅要进行一般的政治思想教育，提高干部思想，同时也为了使政治工作有效地保证国家经济计划的实现。党的工作的干部必须学习经济知识，钻研业务，抓紧完成生产的关键，加强对于工会组织的领导，紧紧掌握职工思想动态，深入进行宣传鼓动工作，提高职工思想觉悟，组织职工具体贯彻上级的指示、决议。
    工会以生产为中心，工会干部不仅一般地动员与组织职工群众的生产竞赛，而且要深入生产、钻研生产中的问题，抓住完成生产任务的关键，贯彻党的保护劳动的政策，协助行政有计划地改善与提高劳动条件，并在发展生产的基础上协助行政举办群众需要的必不可少的福利事业，逐步改善群众生活。如此，工会干部必须深入群众，确切了解职工的劳动与生活上的迫切要求，协同行政具体加以改进。工会应经常向党反映群众生产与生活中的问题，和群众的各种意见和要求，并事先加以分析研究，提出解决这些问题的意见，作为党处理问题的参考，以发挥工会的党与群众联系的纽带的作用。
    党、行政、工会、青年团这样正确的关系不仅在思想上明确起来，而且在组织上加以巩固。首先在党的统一领导下，他们有很好的学习制度。党、行政、工会、青年团车间以上的干部，每日学习政治理论和业务知识一小时。当接到每件工作任务时，也都根据上级的指示，结合本厂具体情况进行学习，领会党的政策思想，然后确定工作的方针步骤，统一干部认识，贯彻执行，三年来坚持如一日。这样，干部就能在共同进步的基础上，永远保持思想一致，步调一致；其次是每天党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部都有“碰头会”，密切联系，互通情报，交流经验，处理具体问题。再次是批评与自我批评，从领导干部直到工会小组都有严格的批评与自我批评制度，结合生产及每个时期的中心任务，定期进行检查。他们用批评与自我批评的方法解决一切矛盾，巩固了政治工作与经济工作的结合，领导与群众的结合，推动工作不断前进。
