Northeast Industrial Department Civil Engineering and Architectural Design Company Runs Crash Course School
Over 500 Technical Cadres Trained in One Year

The Civil Engineering and Architectural Design Company of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department, by running basic construction crash course schools, has trained more than 500 technical cadres in the past year, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient design strength, and significantly improving work quality and efficiency.

In the past, a major difficulty in the company's work was the lack of design personnel. In the design of building plumbing and heating and ventilation, there was not a single specialized technician; only two technicians understood soil analysis, and only two or three people could write engineering geological reports; there was not a single person who understood the technology in surveying. Therefore, often after the structural design of the building was completed, the construction progress was affected because there was no plumbing or heating design; some geological exploration projects had to be entrusted to private merchants, often resulting in poor project quality, frequent rework and delays, causing great losses to the state. In addition, due to the lack of drawing and tracing personnel, the design and drawing of most projects had to be done by engineers and technicians themselves, which wasted manpower and reduced efficiency.

In order to solve this contradiction, the company started a basic construction crash course school in October 1951, and has trained 527 junior and intermediate technical cadres in the past year. This new force has greatly alleviated the difficulties in design work. The plumbing and heating design personnel can not only undertake plumbing and heating design work and complete tasks, but one comrade, by actively learning advanced Soviet experience, created a plumbing and heating pipe diameter calculation table, which transformed complex calculation work into simple table lookup and number checking, and ensured the accuracy of the calculation. Some of the geological, drilling, and soil analysis technicians who have been trained have already taken on the work of group leaders, and some can analyze 56 soil samples per day. The nearly 200 surveying personnel trained have not only solved the difficulty of lacking surveyors and trainees, but also significantly improved the workload. Most of the drawing and tracing personnel are now able to undertake drawing work.

The company has gained the following experiences in running crash course schools to train technical cadres: 1. The training of junior and intermediate technicians cannot be completely dependent on the higher authorities; they must be cultivated actively themselves. 2. In addition to hiring a small number of full-time teachers, most of the teachers in the crash course school can be engineers and technicians within the company who teach part-time; most of the teaching materials are written by the teachers themselves, and then reviewed and approved by the teaching and research group. Because the content taught is practical operation methods and lessons learned, coupled with the teachers interspersing concrete examples when lecturing, students can accept quickly, understand deeply, and easily operate practically after leaving the school. 3. Efforts should be concentrated on tackling one subject according to work needs. The scope of design work is very broad. If you learn everything in five or six months, you will inevitably not learn well. 4. Running a crash course school must be based on tasks and needs, so that the training of technical forces can be combined with current work. 5. Short-term study must be closely combined with internships in order to undertake practical work after graduation. 6. Although the newly trained technical personnel can do general design work, they are not very proficient or skilled after all. Therefore, it is necessary to educate the original technical personnel to take apprentices and do this work well, so that the new cadres can quickly improve their technical level.

In order to complete the design tasks for larger basic construction projects next year, the company has recently established two more plumbing and heating design training classes. In the future, it will also vigorously train personnel in geological drilling, soil analysis, and other fields according to work needs.

    东北工业部土木建筑设计公司开办速成学校
    一年来培养技术干部五百多名
    东北人民政府工业部土木建筑设计公司，用举办基本建设速成学校的办法，一年来培养技术干部五百多名，克服了设计力量不足的困难，工作质量和效率都显著提高。
    过去该公司工作中的一个主要困难是设计力量不足：在建筑物的上下水道、取暖通风设计方面，没有一个专门技术人员；懂得土壤分析的只有两个技术人员，能作工程地质报告书的也只有两三个人；测量方面也没有一个懂得技术的人员。因此，往往建筑结构设计完了，因没有水道暖气设计，便影响了施工进度；有些地质钻探工程不得不委托私商去做，往往工程质量低劣，经常返工、拖期，给国家造成很大损失。此外，因缺少制图、描图人员，大部工程的设计和制图，只好由工程师和技术员亲自来做，因而浪费人力，效率不高。
    为解决这一矛盾，该公司从一九五一年十月开办了基本建设速成学校，一年来培养了初级和中级技术干部五百二十七名。这批新生力量，给设计工作解决了很大困难。水暖设计人员不但能承担水暖设计工作，完成任务，而且有一个同志因积极学习苏联先进经验，创造了水暖管径计算表，使繁杂的计算工作，变为简易的查表查数工作，并保证了计算的正确。培养出的地质、钻探、土壤分析技术人员，有的已担起组长的工作，有的每天已可分析五十六筒土壤。培养出的近二百名测量人员，不但解决了缺少测工、练习生的困难，工作量上也显著提高。描图、制图人员，大部分已能担当制图工作。
    该公司在举办速成学校培养技术干部中，取得以下几点经验：一、初级和中级技术人员，不能完全依赖上级解决，必须自己主动培养。二、速成学校的教员，除聘请少数专职教员外，大部分都可由公司内的工程师和技术员兼课；绝大部分教材都由教员自己编写，再由教学研究组研究通过。因为教授内容都是实际操作方法和经验教训，加上教员在讲课时多穿插具体事例，就能使学生接受快，体会深，出校后易于实际操作。三、应根据工作需要集中力量突击一门。设计工作范围很广，若在五六个月内什么都学，必然学不好。四、开办速成学校必须依据任务和需要进行培养，这样就可以把培养技术力量和当前工作结合起来。五、短期学习密切结合实习，毕业后才能担当起实际工作。六、新培养出来的技术人员虽然能做一般的设计工作，但终究不是很熟练很精通的，因此，必须教育原有技术人员带徒弟做好这一工作，才能使新干部迅速提高技术水平。
    该公司为完成明年更大的基本建设的设计任务，最近又成立了两个水道暖气设计训练班。以后还要根据工作需要，大力培养地质钻探、土壤分析等人员。
