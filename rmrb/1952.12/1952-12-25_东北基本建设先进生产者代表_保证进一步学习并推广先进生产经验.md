Northeast Basic Construction Advanced Producers Representatives
Guarantee Further Study and Promotion of Advanced Production Experience

Respected Chairman Mao: This year is the first year of Northeast's key construction. Under your wise leadership and the patient technical guidance of Soviet experts, all basic construction workers in the Northeast have worked hard, and many construction units have completed more than 90% of their annual basic construction tasks by the end of November. The quality of the projects has also been significantly improved. For example, the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant's projects have all reached advanced technical standards, and some projects have even exceeded the standards; project costs have also been reduced compared to the past.

We have learned and promoted various advanced experiences, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which has played a decisive role in accelerating the construction progress, improving project quality, and reducing costs. For example, the central shaft of the Xi'an Coal Mine implemented a parallel operation method, which allows the project, which originally required ten years, to be completed in five years. We have also promoted many advanced experiences in other aspects such as mechanical installation, mine construction, civil engineering, design, and geological surveying. At the "Basic Construction Advanced Producers Representatives Conference" jointly convened by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions from November 30th to December 4th, we fully exchanged advanced experiences in various fields. We guarantee that after returning to our work posts, we will definitely further study and mobilize the vast number of workers to learn these advanced experiences, and strive to complete the large-scale economic construction tasks next year!

All Representatives of the Northeast "Basic Construction Advanced Producers Representatives Conference"

    东北基本建设先进生产者代表
    保证进一步学习并推广先进生产经验
    敬爱的毛主席：今年是东北重点建设的第一年。在您英明的领导下和苏联专家耐心的技术指导下，东北全体基本建设职工们积极努力，许多建设单位到十一月底已完成了全年基本建设任务百分之九十以上，工程质量也有了显著改进。如阜新火力发电厂的工程全部达到先进的技术标准，有些工程还超过了标准；工程成本也比过去降低了。
    我们学习与推广了各种先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验，这对于加速施工进度与提高工程质量、降低成本等方面都起了决定性的作用。如西安煤矿中央竖井实行了平行作业法，使原需时十年的工程可以在五年内完成。其他机械安装、矿井建设、土木建筑、设计及地质勘测等方面，我们也都推广了许多先进经验。我们在十一月三十日至十二月四日的东北人民政府工业部和东北总工会联合召开的“基本建设先进生产者代表会议”上，充分交流了各方面的先进经验。我们保证：回到工作岗位后，一定更进一步地学习、并动员广大职工来学习这些先进经验，为完成明年大规模的经济建设任务而奋斗！
    东北“基本建设先进生产者代表会议”全体代表
