    Learn From Zhang Guofu's Spirit of Loving the People
    The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government issued an "Order on posthumously recognizing Comrade Zhang Guofu as a Model People's Police Officer," deciding to posthumously recognize Comrade Zhang Guofu, who heroically sacrificed himself while saving the people, as a model people's police officer, to erect a monument at the site of the martyr's sacrifice, and to launch a movement among the national people's police to learn from Comrade Zhang Guofu's noble qualities of being loyal to his duty and loyal to the people. This movement will further enhance the revolutionary virtue of the people's police in wholeheartedly protecting the interests of the people.
    Comrade Zhang Guofu's heroic act of sacrificing himself to save the people concentratedly demonstrates the excellent qualities of the people's police and the essential difference between the people's police and the police under reactionary rule. The police in the Kuomintang era were tools for the Kuomintang reactionaries to suppress the people and executors of reactionary policies. They oppressed, humiliated, extorted, and committed all kinds of evil against the people. The people feared them like snakes and hated them to the bone. The victory of the national revolution eliminated the reactionary old police system. Through three years of education by the Communist Party and the People's Government, the general people's police have established the idea and style of serving the people and have done many beneficial things for the people. However, there are still individual members of the people's police who retain to some extent the old police style in their thinking and style of work. Although this is an individual and residual phenomenon, it is incompatible with the glorious title of people's police and with the glorious task of safeguarding the people's revolutionary cause that the people's police are shouldering today. Therefore, it must be changed rapidly.
    Comrade Zhang Guofu, with his immortal deeds, has erected an extremely glorious banner for the people's police. The people's police across the country should learn from Comrade Zhang Guofu's revolutionary spirit and excellent qualities, and constantly examine their enthusiasm and initiative in serving the people. If there are still shortcomings, they should strive to overcome them, improve themselves, and play a greater role in their positions as people's police.

    学习张国富热爱人民的精神
    中央人民政府公安部发出“关于追认张国富烈士为模范人民警察的命令”，决定追认因抢救人民而壮烈牺牲的张国富烈士为模范人民警察，在烈士殉职地建立纪念碑，并在全国人民警察中开展一个学习张国富烈士忠于职守、忠于人民的高贵品质的运动。这一运动将进一步提高人民警察全心全意保护人民利益的革命品德。
    张国富烈士舍身抢救人民的事迹，集中地表现了人民警察的优秀品质，表现了人民警察与反动统治的警察的本质区别。国民党时代的警察，是国民党反动派镇压人民的工具，是反动政策的执行者。他们对人民进行欺压凌辱，敲诈勒索，无恶不作，人民对他们畏若蛇蝎，恨入骨髓。全国革命的胜利，清除了反动的旧警察制度。经过共产党和人民政府三年来的教育，一般人民警察都树立了为人民服务的思想和作风，为人民群众作了许多有益的事情。但是，在人民警察中迄今还有个别分子在思想作风上保留着某种程度的旧警察作风。这虽然是个别的和残余的现象，但它和人民警察这一光荣称号是不相容的，和人民警察今天所肩负的保卫人民革命事业的光荣任务也是不相容的，因此，必须求得迅速改变。
    张国富烈士以不朽的事迹为人民警察树立了一面极其光辉的旗帜。全国的人民警察，都应该学习张国富烈士的革命精神和优秀品质，随时检查自己为人民服务的热情和积极性。如果还有不够的地方，就应该努力克服缺点，提高自己，使自己在人民警察的岗位上发挥更大的作用。
