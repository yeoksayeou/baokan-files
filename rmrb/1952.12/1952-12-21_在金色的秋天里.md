In the Golden Autumn
Zhou Libo

Near Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, there is a mountain originally called God Mountain, now renamed Choibalsan Mountain. On the mountain, there is a forest resembling maple woods, and when autumn arrives, the leaves change color, appearing golden from a distance. Because of the autumn scenery on this mountain, the people of Ulaanbaatar call autumn the "Golden Autumn."

This year, in the Golden Autumn, we flew to Mongolia to participate in the "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week" held by the Mongolian government. Autumn is the season of harvest, and the holding of the Friendship Week added an extra layer of festive joy to Mongolia's beautiful capital.

The Friendship Week began on our National Day, and the Mongolian people celebrated our festival as if it were their own. In the center of Ulaanbaatar's spacious Sukhbaatar Square, in front of the mausoleum of Marshal Choibalsan, stood several huge red flags waving in the wind. A large portrait of Stalin was hung on the beautiful building of the State Theatre, flanked by portraits of Chairman Mao and Tsedenbal. Both sides of Stalin Avenue and Choibalsan Avenue were lined with the national flags of China and Mongolia on every utility pole. All factories, schools, and many residents' homes displayed portraits of Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Tsedenbal side by side. Radio stations broadcast "The East is Red" and "Ode to Choibalsan," as well as other beautiful songs from China and Mongolia. Cinemas screened films such as "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "Liberated China," and "The Victory of the Chinese People." Theaters staged "The White Haired Girl" in Mongolian, and song and dance troupes and circuses all performed wonderful new programs for the Friendship Week. People talked about "The White Haired Girl" and "Steel Warrior." From these excellent artistic works of New China, they saw the suffering and heroic struggles of the Chinese working people. The New China photo exhibition and the industrial exhibition aroused great interest among the Mongolian people, especially the latter. In Ulaanbaatar, 130,000 people visited our industrial exhibition, exceeding the total population of Ulaanbaatar. Many Mongolian men and women rode horses and camels from remote rural areas to see our exhibition, and many cadres and residents visited it several times. Mrs. Choibalsan was one of those who visited more than twice.

Representatives of the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation participated in many reports and seminars, introducing the situation and achievements of Chinese culture and art. The Chinese song and dance troupe performed many programs rich in Chinese national characteristics, all of which were warmly welcomed by the Mongolian government and people.

Mongolia's party and government leaders and working people were filled with admiration and joy at seeing the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people in economic and cultural fields. We were also deeply impressed by the significant achievements of the Mongolian people in economic and cultural construction.

In more than 30 years of construction, Mongolia has progressed from a near-medieval nomadic society to a near-socialist society, which is an astonishing leap in development. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has absorbed a great deal of advanced Soviet experience, closely linked with Mongolia's actual conditions, improved animal husbandry, and established new types of industry and agriculture, which Mongolia had never had before, around animal husbandry. Many modern factories have appeared in Mongolia's cities, and new mowing machines and tractors are already in use on the vast grasslands.

The Mongolian people's achievements today have not come easily. Before the victory of the Chinese people, the Mongolian People's Republic was surrounded on three sides by Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The government of the republic had to use a portion of the nation's manpower and resources to consolidate national defense, thus slowing down the pace of construction. Domestically, agents sent by imperialist and feudal forces infiltrated government agencies and attempted to subvert the people's regime several times. Sukhbaatar, the founding leader of Mongolia, was poisoned to death by secret agents. "Leftist" and rightist errors also occurred within the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, causing enormous losses to the party and the people.

Under the guidance and care of Lenin and Stalin, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party correctly led the people to overcome numerous difficulties and steadily embarked on today's road, achieving great success. Imperialists have never forgotten Mongolia's grasslands, herds of horses, and mineral deposits, nor have they forgotten that this plateau could be the best base for attacking the Soviet Union. After the Japanese imperialists occupied our Northeast, they shamelessly declared that they would review troops in Ulaanbaatar. However, no Japanese soldier ever lived to reach the capital of this emerging people's democratic country, except as prisoners.

Mongolia's feudal forces were deeply rooted and difficult to eradicate. In 1921, when Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan led troops to liberate Kulun, Mongolia was being ruled by a Khan supported by White Russians. In order to take care of the masses who were not yet sufficiently aware at the time, especially to take care of more than 100,000 lamas, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided not to abolish the Khan and stipulated that the form of government would be a constitutional monarchy. However, the people signed a "pledge" with the Khan, strictly limiting his power. It was not until 1924, after the death of the Khan Bogd Khan, that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party led the entire people to change the constitutional monarchy into a people's republic, and changed the capital Kulun to "Ulaanbaatar," which in Chinese means "City of Red Heroes."

For 31 years, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, following the kind teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and under the correct leadership of Sukhbaatar, Choibalsan, and Tsedenbal, has built Mongolia into a completely new type of people's democratic country. All land has been nationalized, and all factories, mines, railways, highways, and other economic lifelines are in the hands of the state. Industry and agriculture have been developed from scratch, steadily advancing in accordance with Mongolia's actual conditions. Although 90 percent of animal husbandry is still privately operated, production cooperatives have begun to be established and gradually promoted. At present, the government is vigorously promoting the use of machines to drill wells, cultivating pastures with advanced methods, and establishing a large number of veterinary stations to conduct widespread vaccinations for livestock. Now, diseases such as mange, foot-and-mouth disease, and anthrax in livestock herds have basically disappeared.

Mongolia's culture, education, and art have made brilliant achievements. Before the revolution, Mongolia was a culturally very backward place. The number of literate people in the country accounted for only 0.7 percent of the total population. There was only one school for feudal aristocrats and one newspaper in the country; however, there were more than 700 large lama temples, and the smaller ones were not counted. There were more than 100,000 lamas in total. Today, the number of literate people in the country accounts for 92 percent of the total population, which means that illiteracy has been basically eliminated. According to this year's statistics, there are 60 kindergartens in Mongolia, enrolling 2,295 children; 377 primary schools, with 53,331 primary school students; 31 seven-year middle schools, with 8,564 middle school students; 21 ten-year middle schools, that is, complete middle schools, with 1,456 middle school students; 14 technical colleges, with 3,054 students. In addition, there is a National Choibalsan University and a senior party school in Ulaanbaatar.

Before the revolution, Mongolia did not have a clinic; now it has 49 large clinics and 370 small clinics.

Before the revolution, Mongolia did not have spoken drama, opera, acrobatics, or circus. Now, with the help and influence of the Soviet Union, these art forms have all been developed, and have reached a considerable level. The "wrestling" in the circus, promoting the traditional Mongolian spirit of bravery, has become a strong and original program with Mongolian national characteristics.

Mongolia's music, fine arts, literature, and architecture have all made great achievements, especially architecture, which has many things worthy of our learning. After the revolution, especially in recent years, many new-style buildings and towers have been built in Ulaanbaatar, some of which are very beautiful. The government building, the National Theatre, and the Choibalsan University building are all pleasing to the eye and have their own characteristics. Mongolia's achievements in architecture are due to the fact that the architects and workers (including overseas Chinese) resolutely rejected vulgar, glaring, American-style styles, learned the beautiful, fresh, Soviet style, and added their own originality. The architects and workers have spared no effort to make every building, inside and out, a refined and lovely artistic creation.

The stable, pragmatic, capable, Marxist-Leninist-armed, and modest Mongolian party and government leaders are closely aligned with the Soviet Union, transforming a long-backward and impoverished Mongolia into a modern and prosperous country, and have made its capital very beautiful. Now, under the leadership of the emerging working class, the people of the whole country are steadily advancing towards socialism.

The Mongolian people maintain close and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. Their outstanding leader Tsedenbal once said:

"The Mongolian people believe that consolidating the unwavering fraternal friendship with the great Soviet Union and the great People's Republic of China by all possible means is the solid guarantee of its freedom and independence."

The Mongolian people are precisely following Tsedenbal's words in handling its relations with China and the Soviet Union.

During our stay in Mongolia, we were received with extraordinarily grand and warm hospitality by the Mongolian government and people. We were warmly welcomed wherever we went, because they regarded us as representatives of the Chinese people. They love China, so they also love all the people sent by China.

During the Friendship Week, the cities and countryside of Mongolia were adorned with portraits of Stalin and Chairman Mao painted by Mongolian artists. In a state farm, we saw many red paper slogans written in Chinese saying "Long Live Chairman Mao." At the highest party school, some students were studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." In a kindergarten in Ulaanbaatar, a class of children around the age of five sang "The East is Red" in Chinese.

In the slightly chilly autumn, when we boarded the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation plane, left Ulaanbaatar, and flew back to our motherland, everyone's hearts were filled with deep gratitude for the Mongolian party and government leaders and the Mongolian people, thanking them for their deep affection and hospitality towards our cultural and artistic delegation, and thanking them for their enthusiasm and love for the Chinese people and our leader Comrade Mao Zedong. At the same time, we also recalled the brilliant achievements of Mongolia's economy and culture that we had seen, and we greatly admired and were very happy about their achievements. We are so happy because we know that the achievements of any fraternal country will contribute to peace, and striving for peace is the common cause of our China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and other fraternal countries, as well as the people of the world.

    在金色的秋天里
    周立波
    蒙古人民共和国的首都乌兰巴托的附近有一座山，原先叫神山，现在改名为乔巴山山。山上有一片枫林似的丛林，一到秋天，叶子变色了，远远望去，一片金黄。由于这山上的秋色，乌兰巴托的人们把秋天叫做金色的秋天。
    今年，在金色的秋天里，为了参加蒙古政府举办的“蒙中友好旬”，我们飞到了蒙古。秋天是收获的季节，由于友好旬的举行，蒙古的美丽的首都更添上了一层节日的欢喜。
    友好旬从我们的国庆日开始，蒙古人民把我们的节日当做自己的节日一样来祝贺。在乌兰巴托的宽阔的苏赫·巴托尔广场的中心，在乔巴山元帅的陵墓的前面，插着几面迎风飘展的、巨大的红旗。国家剧场的漂亮的建筑上挂着巨幅的斯大林画像，两旁是毛主席和泽登巴尔的肖像。斯大林大街和乔巴山大街两边的每一根电线杆子都插着中蒙两国的国旗。一切工厂、学校和许多居民的住宅都并排的挂着斯大林、毛主席和泽登巴尔的画像。广播电台播送着“东方红”和“乔巴山颂”以及中蒙两国其他优美的歌曲。电影院放映着“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“解放了的中国”和“中国人民的胜利”等影片，剧场上演了蒙语“白毛女”，歌舞剧团和马戏院都为友好旬排演了精彩的新节目。人们谈论着“白毛女”和“钢铁战士”。他们从新中国的这些优秀的艺术作品里，看到了中国劳动人民的生活的苦难和斗争的英勇。新中国的图片展览会和工业展览会引起了蒙古人民的莫大的兴趣，尤其是后者。在乌兰巴托参观我们的工业展览会的有十三万人，超过了乌兰巴托全体居民的数目。许多蒙古的男女骑着马和骆驼从遥远的乡间赶来看我们的展览会，许多干部和居民一连看几回。乔巴山夫人就是参观了两次以上的人们中间的一个。
    中国文艺代表团的代表参加了许多报告会和座谈会，介绍了中国文化和文艺的情况和成就；中国歌舞团演出了许多富有中国民族色彩的节目，这一切都受到了蒙古政府和蒙古人民的热烈的欢迎。
    蒙古的党政领袖和劳动人民看到中国人民在经济和文化方面的卓越的成就，都感到钦佩和欢喜。而蒙古人民在经济和文化建设方面的重大成就，也都使得我们深深的佩服。
    在三十多年的建设中，蒙古已经从接近中世纪的游牧社会进到了接近社会主义的社会，这是一个惊人的飞跃的发展。蒙古人民革命党大量的吸收苏联的先进经验，紧紧的联系着蒙古的实际条件，改良了牧业，并且围绕着牧业建立了蒙古从来没有的新型的工业和农业。蒙古的各个城市，出现了好多现代化工厂，而在辽阔的草原上，已经使用新式的割草机和拖拉机了。
    蒙古人民得到今天的成就，是不容易的。中国人民胜利以前，蒙古人民共和国被日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮三面包围着，共和国政府不得不用国家一部分人力和物力来巩固国防，因而减低了建设的速度。而在国内，帝国主义和封建势力派遣的特务打入了政府的机关，几次图谋颠覆人民的政权。蒙古的开国领袖苏赫·巴托尔，就是被特务匪徒毒死的。蒙古人民革命党的内部也曾发生“左”倾和右倾的错误，给党和人民带来了巨大的损失。
    在列宁和斯大林的忠告与关怀之下，在苏联的无私的帮助之下，蒙古人民革命党正确的领导着人民克服了重重的困难，稳步地走上了今天的道路，获得了伟大的成就。帝国主义者从来没有忘记蒙古的草地、马群和矿藏，也没有忘记这个高原可以作为进攻苏联的最好的基地。日本帝国主义者占领了我们的东北以后，就无耻地扬言，他们要到乌兰巴托阅兵了。但是，除了俘虏以外，没有一个日本兵活着到过这个新兴人民民主国家的首都。
    蒙古的封建势力曾经是根深蒂固，很难拔除的。一九二一年，苏赫·巴托尔和乔巴山带领部队解放库伦的时候，蒙古正被白俄扶植的大汗统治着。为了照顾当时觉悟不够的群众，特别是照顾十万以上的喇嘛，蒙古人民革命党决定不废除大汗，把国体订为君主立宪制，但人民跟大汗订立了“誓约”，严格地限制着他的权力。直到一九二四年，大汗包格多格金死了以后，蒙古人民革命党才领导全体人民把君主立宪国改为人民共和国，把首都库伦改为“乌兰巴托”，用汉文来说，就是“红色英雄城”。
    三十一年间，蒙古人民革命党遵照着列宁、斯大林的亲切的教导，在苏赫·巴托尔、乔巴山和泽登巴尔的正确领导下，把蒙古建设成了一个完全新型的人民民主的国家，全国土地已归国有，全国的工厂、矿山、铁路、公路和其他一切经济命脉都掌握在国家的手里，工业和农业都是从无到有，切合蒙古的实际，稳步前进的。牧业虽有百分之九十还是由私人经营，但是生产合作社已经开始建立，并逐渐推广。目前政府大力举办的事业就是用机器打井，用先进的方法培植牧草，并且大量设置兽医站，对牲畜普遍地进行防疫注射。现在，牲畜群里的癞病、口蹄疫和炭疽病等等疫病基本上已经绝迹了。
    蒙古的文化教育和文艺都有辉煌的成就。革命以前，蒙古是一个文化十分落后的地方。全国识字的人数只占全部人口的百分之零点七；全国只有一所封建贵族的学校，一种报纸；可是大喇嘛庙却有七百多个，小的还不计算在内，喇嘛总共有十万人以上。今天，全国识字的人数已占全部人口的百分之九十二，这就是说，基本上消灭了文盲。根据今年的统计，蒙古全国有幼儿园六十所，招收儿童二千二百九十五人；小学校三百七十七所，小学生五万三千三百三十一人；七年制中学三十一所，中学生八千五百六十四人；十年制中学，即完全中学二十一所，中学生一千四百五十六人；技术专科学校十四所，学生三千○五十四人，此外，在乌兰巴托还有国立乔巴山大学一所和高级党校一所。
    革命以前，蒙古没有一个诊疗所，现在有大诊疗所四十九个，小诊疗所三百七十个。
    革命以前，蒙古没有话剧、歌剧、杂技和马戏，现在在苏联的帮助和影响之下，这些艺术形式都已经有了，而且达到了相当高度的水平。马戏里面的“摔跤”，发扬了蒙古传统的勇武的精神，成为一种健壮的、富有蒙古民族色彩的独创的节目。
    蒙古的音乐、美术、文学和建筑都有巨大的成就，特别是建筑，值得我们借鉴的地方是很多的。革命以后，特别是近几年来，乌兰巴托盖了许多新式的大厦和楼房，其中的一些是很漂亮的。政府大厦，国家剧场和乔巴山大学的建筑，都很悦目，又各有特点。蒙古在建筑方面的这种成就是由于建筑的技师和工人（其中有华侨）坚决地排斥了庸俗的、刺目的、美国式的作风，学习了优美的、新鲜的、苏联的风格，并且加上了自己的独创；建筑技师和工人都费尽心机，尽量使得每一座建筑物，里里外外，都成为精致的、可爱的艺术创作。
    稳重、踏实、能干、用马克思列宁主义武装着，而且虚怀若谷的蒙古的党政领袖们，紧紧地靠拢着苏联，把一个长期落后和穷困的蒙古变成了一个现代化的丰足的国家，并且把它的首都经营得非常的美丽。现在，全国人民，在新兴的工人阶级带领之
    下正向着社会主义稳步前进。
    蒙古人民对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家都维持着亲密的友好的关系。他们的卓越的领袖泽登巴尔曾经说：
    “蒙古人民认为用一切可能的方法来巩固与伟大苏联和伟大中华人民共和国的始终不渝的兄弟般的友谊，乃是它的自由与独立的坚固保证。”
    蒙古人民正是依照泽登巴尔的话来处理它和中苏之间的关系的。
    我们在蒙古的期间，受到了蒙古政府和人民的异常隆重的、热情的接待，我们无论走到那里，都受到热烈的欢迎，这是因为他们把我们当做中国人民的代表，他们爱中国，因此也爱中国派去的一切人们。
    在友好旬里，蒙古的城市和乡下，都挂着蒙古的美术家们所画的斯大林和毛主席的画像。在一个国家农场里我们看见了许多用中文写着的“毛主席万岁”的红纸标语。在最高党校，有些学员正在研究毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”。在乌兰巴托的一所幼儿园里，一班五岁左右的孩子唱着中文的“东方红”。
    在微冷的秋天，当我们坐上中苏民航机，离开乌兰巴托飞回祖国的时候，大家的心里充满了对于蒙古党政领袖和蒙古人民的深深的感激，感谢他们对于我们文艺代表团的深情厚意的招待，感谢他们对于中国人民和我们的领袖毛泽东同志的热情、敬爱。同时，我们也想起了我们所看到的蒙古的经济和文化的辉煌的成就，对于他们的成就我们十分钦佩，也十分欢喜；我们所以怀着欢喜之情，是因为我们知道任何兄弟国家的成就都会对于和平有所贡献的，而争取和平正是我们中苏蒙三国和其他兄弟国家以及全世界人民共同的事业。（附图片）
