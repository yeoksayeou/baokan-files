Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Experience in Transferring Cadres from Production Departments to Strengthen Basic Construction Forces
By Jin Tiequn, Deputy Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper

Editor's Note: The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government has repeatedly instructed all production departments to actively transfer the most outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers to basic construction departments in order to strengthen basic construction forces. This is a firmly established policy. When implementing this policy, some heads of production departments raised various difficult questions, such as "Where to transfer people from," "Will production collapse," "How will new cadres and technical personnel grow," etc. Comrade Jin Tiequn's article uses the practical experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in transferring cadres to powerfully answer these questions. This is a good experience worthy of study by leading cadres of various enterprise departments.

For three years, with the help of Soviet experts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the state and has trained and promoted a large number of new cadres. However, the contradiction between arduous production tasks and insufficient cadre strength, especially the lack of engineering and technical personnel, has not been resolved; moreover, almost every factory, mine, department, and office has faced this contradiction. Since the start of construction in July 1949, each unit has continuously requested the personnel department to increase the number of cadres.

Under such circumstances, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government put forward new tasks to the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Anshan Iron and Steel Company: to put basic construction in the primary position and to transfer a large number of cadres and engineering and technical personnel from production departments to strengthen basic construction forces. It is conceivable that the resistance to implementing this task would not be small. Many cadres doubted why basic construction needed so many cadres; some believed that transferring a large number of cadres would cause production to collapse; some hoped to specialize in their current roles and were unwilling to engage in basic construction. Last winter, in order to strengthen the design, construction, and planning departments of basic construction, it was necessary to transfer seventy engineering and technical personnel from the production side by name. After repeated persuasion and mobilization, some units still requested to not transfer, transfer fewer, delay the transfer, or transfer weaker personnel while retaining the stronger ones. Some even questioned, "Is the leadership willing to let production collapse?"

This spring, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government again issued instructions on the issue of transferring cadres from production departments to strengthen basic construction forces: it is imperative to ensure that the basic construction organization becomes the strongest organization, and it is imperative to ensure that the number and quality of cadres and technical personnel in basic construction exceed those in production; Anshan Iron and Steel Company was specifically instructed to transfer cadres in batches and in large numbers from production departments to basic construction departments, and it was specifically stipulated that another 20 percent of the remaining technical personnel should be transferred. We strictly implemented this instruction and thoroughly completed the above tasks. Up to now, we have successively transferred 364 administrative cadres, 210 engineering and technical personnel, a large number of cadres for Party and mass work, and some skilled workers from production departments. Except for the old cadres designated by the Ministry of Industry to remain, all have been transferred to basic construction departments. Currently, the number of old cadres and technical personnel in basic construction departments is more than twice that of production departments, and the leadership strength of basic construction at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been greatly strengthened.

Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council held a meeting to discuss basic construction issues for next year. Director Chen Yun gave important instructions at the meeting, and People's Daily also published an editorial on this topic, both emphasizing the need to transfer cadres from production departments to strengthen basic construction forces. Now, I would like to introduce the experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in carrying out this work:

First, solving ideological problems is the key to smoothly carrying out the work of transferring cadres. It is necessary to make all cadres understand: "Why should basic construction be placed in the primary position," "Why is it necessary to transfer so many cadres to basic construction departments," "Why should the main source of people be transferred from the production side." At the beginning, many cadres at Anshan Iron and Steel Company were not clear about these issues. They did not understand what kind of organizations basic construction needed to establish and how many cadres were needed. Later, the organizations were determined, and the cadres engaged in basic construction understood that basic construction needed strong organizations and a lot of manpower; many cadres on the production side still did not understand why such a complex and large organization was needed. As for the question of "Where to transfer people from," the common answer from both sides was: "Not many people can be transferred from the production side, the main source is to ask the higher authorities!" Later, the instructions from the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, especially Comrade Chen Yun's enlightenment to us, made us gradually realize that: the state's basic construction in the industrial field is not only an economic and technical issue, but more importantly, it embodies the state's industrial policy; the speed of basic construction determines the speed of national industrialization. At the same time, we also understood that we must put basic construction in the first place in our leadership work, and the source of basic construction cadres should mainly be transferred from the production side; if cadres cannot be quickly transferred to basic construction departments, affecting the progress of basic construction, it will cause a historical political error. After these issues were resolved in the minds of the cadres, the obstacles in the work were eliminated. The plan to transfer a large number of cadres from the production side to the basic construction side was smoothly realized.

Second, transferring a large number of cadres to basic construction will not cause production to collapse. Some comrades at Anshan Iron and Steel Company were worried about this issue, but the facts have proved that this is not the case. Because the production units have undergone three years of restoration and reform work, undergone multiple mass movements, political work has a certain foundation, and business management has been put on track; at the same time, a large number of new cadres have been promoted, and a large number of activists have emerged. The leadership has strengthened the leadership of production management. Therefore, after a large number of cadres were transferred in the spring, not only could production continue as usual, but new forces grew, and nearly 2,000 new cadres were promoted, overfulfilling the production tasks and creating many new innovations. For example, in the ore dressing plant, the factory director and the Party committee secretary were transferred away, but the factory was not only able to complete its tasks as usual, but was also rated as a winning factory at the recent city-wide production competition summary meeting. The volume utilization coefficient of a certain blast furnace in the iron smelting plant has now exceeded all capitalist countries and reached the level of the Soviet Union. The steelmaking plant implemented rapid steelmaking, creating a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and nine minutes. The plans for various major products of the entire company and the completion of tasks by various factories and mines have greatly exceeded last year. From the comparison of this year's quarters, the output of various products has increased quarter by quarter. For example, the output of pig iron increased by 2.8 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and by another 4.6 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter; the output of steel increased by 4 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and by another 5.5 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter; the output of coke increased by 12.7 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and by another 5.1 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The output of primary rolled steel decreased by 1.6 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to maintenance, but exceeded the first quarter by 32.6 percent in the third quarter. It is estimated that this year, all major production departments of the entire company will be able to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule in mid-December.

Third, "cutting leeks" is the best way to transfer cadres from the production side to the basic construction departments. Anshan Iron and Steel Company used to frequently and sporadically transfer cadres from the production side to the basic construction side last year. This spring, it changed to the method of "cutting leeks" in batches. Facts have proved that "cutting leeks" is the best method. Adopting this method can strengthen the planning of both sides' work and is conducive to the organizational leadership of both sides. Transferring leaders such as the factory director, first deputy factory director, and chief engineer, as well as various led cadres together, transferring the entire set of cadres as a whole, being familiar with each other, and facilitating work. This can not only meet the needs of the basic construction departments in a timely manner, but also enable the production units to concentrate their efforts on ideological mobilization, comprehensively adjust cadres, and promote a large number of new cadres to fill vacancies, avoiding the phenomenon of frequent sporadic transfers causing frequent fluctuations in cadre morale and affecting work.

Fourth, it is necessary to actively, boldly, and regularly cultivate and promote new cadres in the production departments in a planned manner. This can not only quickly fill the vacancies after the transfer, but also prepare for another "cutting leeks." After Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production units transferred a large number of cadres to the basic construction side, in order to fill the vacancies in a timely manner, almost all units paid more attention to the work of promoting and cultivating new cadres. After the "Three-Anti" campaign alone, 744 administrative cadres above the workshop director level were promoted. If the grassroots cadres of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League who were promoted at the same time are included, the total number of cadres promoted is nearly 2,000. This not only filled the cadre vacancies, but also many positions were equipped according to the regulations of one chief and two deputies or one chief and three deputies. These newly promoted cadres have all undergone rotational training and received political education and professional training. Therefore, after the cadres were transferred, the work was not weakened, but strengthened. In order to do a better job in cultivating and training cadres, we are currently adopting the following methods to improve the cultural, technical, and professional level of all employees: First, strengthen the leadership of formal schools such as the attached industrial technical school, administrative cadre school, technical school, and medical school. Second, establish and improve various spare-time schools. Currently, there are nine classes for old cadres to make up for mathematics, physics, and chemistry, with 230 students including old cadres from production and basic construction departments; the technical night school attached to the industrial technical school has more than 400 students who are technicians, skilled workers, and production management cadres from worker backgrounds; the spare-time middle school has 1,000 students, mainly staff members; the spare-time technical school has 1,900 students, mainly workers; the Russian night school has 1,700 students. In addition, we are currently preparing for a spare-time university. Third, hold spare-time training courses. In addition to the 27,000 people in spare-time training organized by various factories and mines, Soviet experts are invited to hold various technical lectures, and all relevant technical personnel and production management cadres participate in the study. Fourth, hold formal training courses that are separated from production, adopting a crash course method to train various technical talents. Training courses of this kind have now been established in ore dressing, transportation, chemical industry, primary rolling, and the general machinery factory and mines. Fifth, conclude master-apprentice contracts, train technicians from skilled workers, train apprentices into skilled workers, or train skilled workers to gradually upgrade. In the past, the entire company has used this method to train and promote 352 worker technicians, and 230 skilled workers are currently being trained. Sixth, carry out technical and professional publicity. For example, regularly hold lectures on professional work, hold a report meeting or discussion meeting to promote the work experience of science and technology departments and sections every week, regularly hold technical research meetings, technical seminars, and advanced experience performance meetings, and publish the "Advanced Producer" publication. In addition, we also pay attention to guiding the internship of foreign personnel and entrust the relevant factories to train technical workers and grassroots cadres on our behalf in order to ensure that the new factories under construction can start production on schedule.

Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is preparing to strengthen the educational work organization and further strengthen the work of cultivating and promoting cadres, preparing to "cut" the "leeks" again in the future and transfer another batch of cadres to the basic construction departments. In addition, we have also initially made plans for the cultivation and training of reserve forces and plans for exporting cadres to the outside world.

    鞍山钢铁公司从生产部门抽调干部
    充实基本建设力量的经验
    中共鞍山市委副书记 本报特约记者 金铁群
    编者按：中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为了增强基本建设的力量，一再指示各个生产部门都必须积极地抽调最优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人到基本建设部门去。这是确定了的方针。在执行这个方针时，有些生产部门的负责人提出了各种疑难问题，如“从那里调人”、“生产会不会垮台”、“新干部和技术人员如何生长”等等。金铁群同志的这篇文章，用鞍山钢铁公司抽调干部的实际经验，有力地解答了这些问题。这是值得各个企业部门的领导干部学习的良好经验。
    三年来，鞍山钢铁公司在苏联专家帮助下，超额完成了国家所给予的任务，并培养和提拔了大量的新干部。但是，生产任务艰巨与干部力量不足，特别是工程技术人员不足的矛盾始终未能解决；而且，几乎每一个厂、矿、部、处都存在着这个矛盾。从一九四九年七月开工以来，各个单位都不断向人事部门提出增加干部的要求。
    就在这样的情况下，中共中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部向中共鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司提出了新的任务：要把基本建设放在首要地位，要从生产部门抽调大批干部和工程技术人员充实基本建设力量。可以想像得到，执行这个任务，阻力是不会小的。许多干部怀疑为什么基本建设需要这么多干部；有的认为这样大量抽调干部会使生产垮台；有些则希望自己能专业化下去，不愿意去搞基本建设。去年冬季，为充实基本建设的设计、施工与计划部门，需要从生产方面指名抽调七十名工程技术人员。经过再三说服动员，仍然有若干单位要求不调、少调、缓调，或调弱的留强的。甚至有人质问：“领导上是不是不惜让生产垮台？”
    今年春季，中共中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部对于从生产部门抽调干部充实基本建设力量这一问题再次发出指示：一定要做到基本建设的机构变成最强大的机构，一定要使基本建设方面的干部和技术人员在数量上质量上都超过生产方面的干部和技术人员；指定鞍山钢铁公司要整批地大量地从生产部门给基本建设部门抽调干部，并且具体规定要从剩余的全体技术人员中再抽调百分之二十。我们严格地贯彻执行了这个指示，彻底完成了上述任务。到目前为止，先后从生产部门抽调了三百六十四名行政干部、二百一十名工程技术人员和大批作党与群众工作的干部及一部分技术工人。老干部除了工业部指名留下的以外，已全部调到基本建设部门。目前基本建设部门的老干部和技术人员比生产部门多出两倍以上，鞍山钢铁公司基本建设的领导力量已大为加强。
    最近政务院财政经济委员会开会讨论明年基本建设问题，陈云主任在会上作了重要指示，同时人民日报为此发表了社论，都强调指出要从生产部门抽调干部充实基本建设力量。现在仅就鞍山钢铁公司在进行这一工作中的体验，作如下介绍：
    第一、解决思想问题是顺利进行抽调干部工作的关键。要使全体干部了解：“为什么要把基本建设放在首要地位”、“为什么需要给基本建设部门抽调这样多的干部”、“为什么人的来源主要是从生产方面抽调”。鞍山钢铁公司的干部，在开始时，不少人对这些问题认识都不太明确，他们不清楚基本建设究竟需要建立些什么机构，需要多少干部。后来机构确定了，做基本建设工作的干部懂得了基本建设需要强大的机构和很多的人力；生产方面仍然有不少干部还不懂得为什么需要这么复杂、庞大的机构。至于“从那里调人”的问题，双方共同的答案是：
    “从生产方面抽不出多少人来，主要来源是向上级要！”后来，中共中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部给我们的指示，特别是陈云同志对我们的启示，使我们逐步地认清了：国家在工业方面的基本建设，不单是经济与技术问题，更重要的是它体现着国家在工业方面的政策；基本建设的速度决定着国家工业化的速度。同时我们也懂得了必须把基本建设摆在领导工作的第一位，基本建设干部的来源应主要从生产方面抽调；如果不能迅速地给基本建设部门抽调干部，影响了基本建设的进度，便会造成历史性的政治错误。在干部思想中解决了这些问题之后，便消除了工作中的障碍。从生产方面给基本建设方面抽调大批干部的计划顺利地实现了。
    第二、大量地给基本建设方面抽调干部并不会使生产垮台。这个问题鞍山钢铁公司有些同志曾经担心过，但事实证明并非如此。因为生产单位已经经过了三年的恢复与改革工作，经过了多次的群众运动，政治工作有了一些基础，经营管理已经走上轨道；同时提拔了大批新干部，涌现了大量的积极分子，领导方面又加强了对于生产管理的领导。所以，在春季大批抽调干部之后，不但生产仍能照常进行，而且生长了新的力量，又提拔了将近两千名新干部，超额完成了生产任务，并出现了很多新的创造。例如选矿厂，厂长与党委书记调走了，工厂不仅还能够照常完成任务，而且在最近全市的生产竞赛总结大会上被评为优胜厂。炼铁厂的某号高炉容积利用系数现在已超过所有资本主义国家，达到了苏联的水平。炼钢厂实行快速炼钢，创造了六小时零九分炼一炉钢的新纪录。全公司各种主要产品的计划和各厂矿完成任务的情况都大大超过了去年。从今年各季度的对比来看，各种产品的产量都逐季上涨。如生铁产量第二季度比第一季度增加百分之二·八，第三季度又比第二季度增加百分之四·六；钢的产量第二季度比第一季度增加了百分之四，第三季度又比第二季度增加了百分之五·五；焦的产量第二季度比第一季度增加了百分之十二·七，第三季度又比第二季度增加了百分之五·一。初轧钢的产量，因为第二季度检修比第一季度减少了百分之一·六，但第三季度则比第一季度超过了百分之三十二·六。估计，今年全公司各主要生产部门，都能在十二月中旬提前完成全年生产计划。
    第三、“割韭菜”是从生产方面向基本建设部门输送干部的最好的方法。鞍山钢铁公司在去年曾经常不断地、零星地从生产方面给基本建设方面抽调干部，今年春季改用了“割韭菜”的整批抽调的方式。事实证明，“割韭菜”是最好的方法。采取这个方法，可以加强双方面工作的计划性，并有利于两方面的组织领导。从厂长、第一副厂长、主任工程师等领导干部到各种被领导的干部一起抽调，把整套的干部全盘端过来，彼此熟悉，便于工作。这样既可及时满足基本建设部门的需要，同时也可以使生产单位集中力量进行思想动员，全盘地调整干部并大量提拔新干部以补足空额，避免因经常零星抽调引起干部情绪经常波动而影响工作的现象发生。
    第四、必须在生产部门积极地、大胆地、经常有计划地培养和提拔新干部。这样既可迅速补足抽调后的空额，又可准备再次“割韭菜”。鞍山钢铁公司生产单位向基本建设方面大量输送干部之后，为了及时地把空额补充起来，差不多所有的单位对于提拔与培养新干部的工作都更加重视了。仅在“三反”之后，就提拔了车间主任以上的行政干部七百四十四名，如果把同时提拔的党、工会、青年团的基层干部计算在内，提拔干部总数已近两千名。这样不仅补足了干部空额，而且很多职位都是按照一正二副或一正三副的规定配备的。这些新提拔的干部，都经过轮训，受了政治教育和业务训练。因此，抽调了干部之后，工作不仅没有削弱，反而加强了。为了把培养与训练干部的工作做得更好，目前我们正采用下面几种方式来提高全体职工的文化、技术与业务水平：第一、加强对附设的工业技术学校、行政干部学校、技工学校、医士学校等正规学校的领导。第二、建立与健全各种业余学校。目前老干部补习数学、物理、化学的学校，共分九个班，学员包括生产与基本建设部门的老干部二百三十人；工业技术学校附设的技术夜校，学员是工人出身的技术员、技术工人与生产管理干部，共四百多人；业余中学，学员以职员为主，共一千人；业余技术学校，学员主要是工人，共一千九百人；俄文夜校，学员有一千七百人。另外，现在正在筹备业余大学。第三、举办业余训练班。除各厂矿已组织了两万七千人的业余训练外，并请苏联专家举办各种技术讲座，有关的技术人员与生产管理干部全体参加学习。第四、举办正规的脱离生产的训练班，采用速成的办法，训练各种技术人材。现在已经在选矿、运输、化工、初轧、机械总厂等部门和矿山设立了这种训练班。第五、订立师徒合同，从技工中培养技术员，把徒工培养为技工，或培养技工逐步升级。过去全公司已经用这种方法培养、提拔了三百五十二名工人技术员，正在培养中的还有二百三十名技工。第六、进行技术、业务宣传。如经常举办业务工作讲座，每周举行一次推广科股工作经验的报告会或座谈会，经常举行技术研究会，技术座谈会和先进经验表演会及出版“先进生产者”刊物等。另外我们也注意指导外来人员的实习，并委托各有关工厂代为培养与训练技术工人和基层干部，以便保证正在建设的新厂能按期开工生产。
    目前鞍山钢铁公司正准备充实教育工作机构，进
    一步加强培养与提拔干部的工作，准备将来再“割”
    一次“韭菜”，给基本建设部门再输送一批干部。另外，我们也已初步做好了后备力量的培养训练计划及向外输出干部的计划。
