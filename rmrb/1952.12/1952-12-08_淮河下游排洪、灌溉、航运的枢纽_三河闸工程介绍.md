    The Hub for Flood Discharge, Irrigation, and Navigation in the Lower Reaches of the Huai River
    -- An Introduction to the Sanhe Sluice Project
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Minxin Li Minghui
    In the southwest corner of Huaiyin County, northern Jiangsu, at the junction of Hongze Lake and the Sanhe River, the massive Sanhe Sluice project has commenced. This is the general control mechanism for controlling floods in the lower reaches of the Huai River and the largest sluice to be built in the Huai River harnessing project.

    The purpose of building the Sanhe Sluice is to control Hongze Lake so that it can help the Huai River to store floodwaters during floods, and at normal times, it can irrigate the surrounding farmland and develop navigation. Hongze Lake did not exist originally. After the Yellow River breached its banks and merged with the Huai River in 1194, the Huai River's estuary in northern Jiangsu became silted up. Since then, the floodwaters from hundreds of tributaries in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River have accumulated at the junction of Anhui and Jiangsu, gradually expanding several small lakes and swamps into Hongze Lake. However, the lake was small and the water volume was large. Whenever the Huai River flood exceeded the lake's capacity, it would overflow the dikes and breach, submerging the North Jiangsu Plain. When disasters occurred, the feudal emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties had no solution but to passively build an embankment around Hongze Lake, forcing the Huai River floodwaters to flow south through the Sanhe River, then through Baoying Lake and Gaoyou Lake, and into the Yangtze River. According to historical hydrological records, the maximum flood flow of the Huai River into Hongze Lake was 14,600 cubic meters per second, while the waterway to the Yangtze River could only accommodate a flow of 8,000 cubic meters per second. The excess floodwaters constantly threatened the people of northern Jiangsu, a major rice and cotton producing area. In the past, the reactionary rulers disregarded the lives of the people and built five sea-returning dams on the eastern dike of the Grand Canal. When a major flood occurred, they would excavate the five dams, which was called "releasing water into the sea." In reality, the canal dike was still hundreds of kilometers away from the sea. Therefore, in the past, whenever there was a flood, the local feudal forces would open the sea-returning dams, and the farmland in more than ten counties in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu would bear the brunt and become a swamp. In drought years, the upper reaches of the Huai River lacked water, and the water in Hongze Lake was discharged completely through the Sanhe River. Even the farmland in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu had no water for irrigation, and the Grand Canal was cut off due to lack of water. For many years, the people of northern Jiangsu had been hoping to be freed from the flood threat of Hongze Lake.

    After the founding of New China, the People's Government decided to thoroughly harness the Huai River and eliminate the threat of floods throughout the Huai River basin. Two years of remediation have already brought some of the Huai River floods under control. The construction of the third annual Huai River harnessing project is an effort to further control floods and develop Huai River water conservancy for multiple purposes. Therefore, the Huai River Harnessing Committee decided to carry out the control project of Hongze Lake. To carry out the control project of Hongze Lake, it is first necessary to build a control sluice at the Sanhekou, the waterway where Hongze Lake flows into the Yangtze River. Once this sluice is built, it will not only further control the Huai River flood but also irrigate the farmland in northern Jiangsu and restore navigation between the Yangtze River and the Huai River.

    The scale of the Sanhe Sluice exceeds that of the Runheji diversion sluice in the middle reaches of the Huai River. The sluice foundation is designed on the east bank of the Sanhe River, and the sluice body is second only to the flood diversion gate of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in length. The entire project is divided into four parts: The first part is the Sanhe control sluice, which controls the water level of Hongze Lake and the flow of the Sanhe River. The sluice body is 697.75 meters long, 132 meters wide, and 9.5 meters high. The bottom slab of the sluice is made entirely of reinforced concrete and is divided into 63 openings. Each opening is equipped with an electric hoist. The second part is to build a seven-li-long grass dam at the mouth of Hongze Lake to first cut off the water flow between Hongze Lake and the old Sanhe channel, in order to raise the water level of Hongze Lake, maintain water transport in Hongze Lake, and facilitate the construction of a barrage dam downstream of the grass dam. The third part is the barrage dam. The dam is 300 meters long, 18 meters high, and 100 meters wide at the top. This project will be carried out after the grass dam is closed. The main purpose of the barrage dam is to block the old Sanhe channel so that the water from Hongze Lake flows into the Yangtze River through the Sanhe Sluice, in order to effectively control the water volume of Hongze Lake. The fourth part is that because the old Sanhe channel is blocked, a new diversion channel must be opened upstream and downstream of the sluice. After these four projects are completed, Hongze Lake can help the Huai River control floods, and the water stored in Hongze Lake can be used to irrigate farmland and develop navigation, and even generate electricity.

    When designing the Sanhe Sluice, the Huai River Harnessing Committee was guided by the advanced technical ideas of Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov and absorbed the successful experience of the Runheji diversion sluice and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Therefore, the engineering design has made great progress. For example, the application of the Soviet experience of not driving piles when building sluices has saved the country 12 percent of the total sluice construction cost, while also enhancing the safety of the sluice body. In order to prevent the groundwater flowing from the upstream of the sluice body through the bottom of the sluice from scouring and damaging the soil of the sluice foundation and affecting the safety of the sluice body, Chinese technicians, with the assistance of Soviet experts, decided to set up an inverted filter downstream of the sluice, which will permanently ensure that the soil of the sluice foundation is not carried away by the groundwater. In addition, a stilling basin and stilling sill cast with cement are set up downstream of the sluice body, so that the surging water head rushing down from the upstream of the sluice can reduce the flow rate and prevent scouring of the riverbed. In addition, the bank walls on both sides of the sluice and the upstream wing walls are all made of concrete hollow box type to adjust the pressure of the soil and the sluice body on the bank walls. These advanced structural styles have played a great role in saving national materials, shortening construction time, and increasing the safety of the sluice body.

    After the completion of the Sanhe Sluice project, it will cooperate with the Gaoliangjian water intake sluice on the North Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal to discharge floods during extremely large floods, reduce the flood peak of the Huai River main stream, and ensure the safety of the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu. In normal years, it can maintain the water level of Hongze Lake above 12.5 meters, so that a large amount of lake water can flow from the Gaoliangjian water intake sluice into the North Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal, irrigating 25.8 million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu. In addition, it can also maintain a certain water level in the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River and the North Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal, enabling year-round navigation. Ships departing from the coast of the Yellow Sea can directly reach the Dabie Mountains in the middle reaches of the Huai River and the Wulongji area in Henan Province. After these shipping routes are restored, the cotton from the North Jiangsu reclamation area, the rice and wheat from the Lixiahe area, and the salt from the Huaibei salt field, as well as the coal, soybeans, and sorghum from northern Anhui, and the tea, bamboo, and other local specialties from the Dabie Mountains, can be transported to the vast towns and villages along the Huai River. The yarn, cloth, and other industrial products from large cities such as Shanghai and Wuxi can also be supplied to the farmers in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River in a timely manner. After the water of Hongze Lake is controlled, the Sanhe Sluice water flow can also be used to generate electricity. The construction of the Hongze Lake control project, coupled with the dredging of the Huai River waterway to the Yangtze River below Hongze Lake, will gradually dry up the Bao Ying Lake, Gaoyou Lake and other lakes with a history of 700 years, resulting in 1.5 million mu of fertile land.

    淮河下游排洪、灌溉、航运的枢纽
    ——三河闸工程介绍
    新华社记者　朱敏信　李明回
    苏北淮阴县的西南角，在洪泽湖和三河的衔接处，一座规模巨大的水闸工程——三河闸已经开工。这是控制淮河下游洪水的总机关，是治淮工程中修建的一个最大水闸。
    修建三河闸，为的是要控制洪泽湖，使洪泽湖在洪水期间能帮助淮河拦蓄洪水，平时又可灌溉四周农田和发展航运。洪泽湖原来是没有的，从一一九四年黄河决堤和淮河合流后，使淮河在苏北境内的入海道淤塞，从此淮河上游和中游数百条支流汇集下来的洪水，便在安徽和江苏交界处停积下来，将原来几个狭小的湖泊沼地逐渐扩大为洪泽湖。但是，湖小水大，每当淮河洪水超过湖的容量时，便漫堤决口，淹没了苏北平原。水灾发生了，明、清的封建帝王没有办法，只是消极地在洪泽湖四周筑起一道围堤，逼使淮河洪水由洪泽湖经三河南流，经宝应湖、高邮湖等入长江。据历年水文记录，淮河流入洪泽湖的最大洪水量有一万四千六百秒公方，而入江水道仅能容纳八千秒公方的流量，多余的洪水便长期地威胁着盛产水稻、棉花的苏北区的人民。过去反动统治者不顾人民的死活，在里运河东堤上修了五道归海坝，遇到较大洪水时，便开掘五坝，这叫做“放水入海”。实际上运河堤离海还有数百公里。所以，过去每遇到洪水，当地的封建势力一开归海坝，苏北里下河区十多县的农田便首当其冲，尽成泽国；在干旱年月，淮河上游缺水，而洪泽湖水又由三河一泻而空，就连苏北里下河区的农田也无水灌溉，运河也因缺水而断航。多少年来，苏北人民总盼望着能从洪泽湖的洪水威胁中解脱出来。
    新中国成立后，人民政府便决定根治淮河，解除淮河全流域的水患。两年的整治已经把一部分淮河洪水控制起来。第三年度治淮工程的施工，是为了进一步控制洪水，多目标地开发淮河水利而努力。因此，治淮委员会决定要作洪泽湖的控制工程。要作好洪泽湖的控制工程，首先就得在洪泽湖入江水道三河口上建造一座控制闸。这座水闸修好了，不仅可以进一步控制淮河的洪水，又可灌溉苏北地区的农田，恢复长江、淮河间的航运。
    三河闸的规模超过淮河中游的润河集分水闸，闸基设计在三河的东岸，闸身长度仅次于荆江分洪工程的进洪闸。整个工程分四部分：第一部分是控制洪泽湖水位和三河流量的三河控制闸，闸身长达六百九十七点七五公尺，宽一百三十二公尺，高九点五公尺；闸底底板全用钢筋混凝土浇成，分六十三孔。每孔闸门上装有电动启闭机。第二部分是在洪泽湖口筑一道七华里长的草坝，首先隔断洪泽湖和三河旧道的水流，用以抬高洪泽湖水位，维持洪泽湖内的水运交通，并便利在草坝下游堵筑拦河坝。第三部分是拦河坝。坝长三百公尺、高十八公尺、顶宽一百公尺。这个工程要等草坝合拢后进行。拦河坝主要是堵塞三河旧道，使洪泽湖水经过三河闸再流入长江，以达到有效地控制洪泽湖水量。第四部分是因为三河旧道堵塞，所以要在水闸上、下游新开一条引河。这四项工程都完成了，洪泽湖就可以帮助淮河控制洪水，洪泽湖蓄的水也就可以用来灌溉农田和发展航运，乃至发电。
    治淮委员会在设计三河闸时，得到苏联水利专家布可夫的先进技术思想的指导，吸收了润河集分水闸及荆江分洪工程的成功经验，因此，工程设计大有进步。如运用苏联建闸不打基桩的经验，就使国家节省了占整个建闸经费的百分之十二的费用，同时还增强了闸身的安全。为了避免从闸身上游流过闸底的地下水冲洗和破坏闸基泥土，影响闸身的安全，我国技术人员在苏联专家协助下，决定在闸的下游设一倒滤器，这样就可永远保证闸基土壤不被地下水带走。另外，在闸身下游设立一个用水泥浇筑的消力塘和消力槛，使水闸上游冲下来的汹涌水头，可以减低流速，不致冲刷河床。此外，闸两旁的岸墙和上游翼墙都是采用混凝土空箱式，以调节泥土和闸身对岸墙的压力。这些先进的结构式样，对节省国家器材、缩短施工时间和增加闸身的安全都起了很大作用。
    三河闸工程完成后，将配合苏北灌溉总渠上的高良涧进水闸，在非常洪水时，可以排除洪水，削减淮河干流的洪水峰，保证苏北里下河的安全。在常年时期，又可保持洪泽湖水位在十二点五公尺以上，使大量的湖水从高良涧进水闸流入苏北灌溉总渠，灌溉苏北地区的二千五百八十万亩农田。此外，还可使淮河中、下游干流和苏北灌溉总渠保持一定水位，能长年通航，从黄海滨出发的船只可以直抵淮河中游的大别山区和河南省境的乌龙集。这些航路恢复以后，苏北垦区的棉花、里下河一带的稻、麦和淮北盐场的食盐，皖北的煤、大豆、高粱，大别山区的茶、竹等土、特产，就可运往淮河沿线的广大城镇和乡村；上海、无锡等大城市的纱、布等工业产品，也可及时地供给淮河中、下游一带农民。洪泽湖水控制起来后，还可利用三河闸水流发电。洪泽湖控制工程的修建，加上洪泽湖以下淮河入江水道的整理，将会使有七百年历史的宝应湖、高邮湖诸湖逐渐干涸，出现一百五十万亩肥沃的土地。
