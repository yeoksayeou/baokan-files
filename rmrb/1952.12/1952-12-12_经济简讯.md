　　Jiangxi Province Launches Winter Farmland Water Conservancy Construction

　　Jiangxi Province has begun large-scale winter farmland water conservancy construction. The projects that have already started include: Chenshi Weir in Ruijin County, Leixi Dam in Guixi County, Shibei Weir in Ji'an County, and the Ximiao and Nanmiao Canals in Anyi County. After the completion of these weirs, dams, and canals, they can irrigate 120,000 mu of paddy fields. The preparations for other medium- and small-sized weirs and mountain valley reservoirs planned to be built in various regions are also largely completed, and formal construction can begin soon.

　　The farmland water conservancy construction plan for Jiangxi Province this winter and next spring includes the construction of 1,000 larger reservoirs, 3,000 small mountain valley reservoirs, and 400 medium and small canals. In addition, farmers can also build 150,000 ponds and dams during the agricultural slack season. Some of these water conservancy projects can be completed this winter; after all are completed, they can irrigate more than 2 million mu of land.

　　More Than Thirty Primary Markets in Shanxi Province Hold Celebrations of Harvest and Materials Exchange Conferences

　　Since mid-October, more than thirty primary markets in Ping shun, Fan chi, Qi county, Lu cheng, Yu ci, and other counties in Shanxi Province have held celebrations of harvest and materials exchange conferences. These materials exchange conferences not only promoted industrial products and purchased agricultural and sideline products from farmers, but also conducted publicity and education for farmers on promoting advanced agricultural technologies and carrying out rural political, cultural, and health movements through various exhibitions. The holding of these exhibitions played a significant role in promoting the sale of industrial products and organizing the transaction of industrial and agricultural products at the conferences. At the materials exchange conference in Pingshun Chengguan, the supply and marketing cooperative sold more than 60 million yuan worth of industrial products in just four days. The turnover of industrial products at the Qixian Dongguan Town materials exchange conference accounted for 44 percent of the total turnover of the conference. At the Lucheng materials exchange conference, seven or eight thousand women visited the health exhibition hall and received health education, and then scrambled to buy various hygiene products. Toothbrushes, soaps, sanitary napkins, etc., became hot commodities. Many people said, "This trip was really not in vain. We bought what we wanted to buy, sold what we wanted to sell, and also learned some scientific knowledge."

　　Currently, governments at all levels in Shanxi Province are preparing to hold widespread materials exchange conferences in primary markets. The Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office has instructed its subordinate areas to hold 300 celebrations of harvest and materials exchange conferences. Many towns are currently investigating the production and sales situation in their districts, formulating specific plans, and actively making preparations.

    江西省展开农田水利冬修工作
    江西省已开始大规模的冬季农田水利修建工作。目前已经开工的有：瑞金县的陈石陂、贵溪县的雷溪坝、吉安县的水北陂、安义县的西缪渠、南缪渠等。这些水陂、坝渠修成后，可以灌溉稻田十二万亩。其他各地计划修建的中、小型水陂、山谷水库，准备工作也大体完成，不日就可正式施工。
    江西省今冬明春农田水利的修建计划，要修建较大的水库有一千座，小型山谷水库三千座，中型和小型水渠四百条。此外，农民利用农闲还可修建十五万座塘坝。这些水利工程有一部分可在今年冬季完成；全部修成后，可以使二百多万亩土地得到灌溉。
    山西省三十多个初级市场举行庆祝丰收
    物资交流大会
    十月中旬以来，山西省平顺、繁峙、祁县、潞城、榆次等县三十多个初级市场举行了庆祝丰收、物资交流大会。各个物资交流大会不但推销了工业品，收购了农民的农产品和副业产品，并通过各种展览会，向农民进行了一次推广农业先进技术和开展农村政治、文化、卫生运动的宣传教育。这些展览会的举办对大会推销工业品和组织工、农业产品的成交都起了很大作用。在平顺城关的物资交流大会上，供销合作社仅在四天内就推销了价值六千多万元的工业品；祁县东关镇物资交流大会工业品成交额占大会成交额的百分之四十四。潞城物资交流大会上七、八千妇女参观卫生展览馆受到了卫生教育后，都争购各种卫生用品，牙刷、香皂、月经带等都变成了热货。很多人都说：“这次真没有白来，想买的买了，想卖的卖了，还学了些科学知识。”
    目前山西省各级政府正准备普遍举行初级市场的物资交流大会，长治专署已指示所属地区要举行三百个庆祝丰收、物资交流大会，现有不少城镇正在调查本区的产销情况，订出具体计划，积极进行筹备。
