    Disbelief in Advanced Farming Techniques Led to Reduced Cotton Production for My Father
    Editor: My father, Wu Yonghai, has been farming all his life and is good at all kinds of labor. However, his conservative thinking is very serious. He doesn't believe in scientific farming methods and sticks to old ways, which led to a reduction in cotton production this year.
    Before planting cotton, the People's Government called for attention to moisture conservation in the cotton fields. The masses in the village listened to the government and harrowed the land after each rain. But my father refused to harrow. When it was time to sow, it hadn't rained for a while, so he had to dry-harrow once, leaving large clumps of soil everywhere. When sowing cotton, the People's Government called on farmers to try the "warm water soaking method." My father thought, "No matter how good the warm water soaking method is, I've never seen it, and I won't use it!" He still used the old method of sowing. Other people's cotton seedlings emerged completely, but my father's cotton only sprouted later. Some villagers said he was suffering from being old-fashioned, but he was still skeptical, saying, "Late flowers yield good cotton, we'll see in the autumn!" In June, cotton aphids became widespread in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, and cotton farmers used various machines and chemicals to control the pests. My father said, "Relying on people to control them, you can't control them no matter how hard you try. Wait for a few rains, and they will naturally go away." He completely ignored the pests in the cotton field. When the cotton blossomed and formed buds, the leaves had already been eaten by the pests, and most of the flower buds fell off. When the cotton matured, the cotton picked by others was white and good, but my father's cotton was not white, and the yield was low. At this time, my father began to understand a little. However, he still didn't want to admit defeat and said to the masses, "Let's see after the cotton is all picked!" Finally, the facts were obvious: the average cotton yield in the township was about twenty catties of lint per mu, but my father's thirteen mu of cotton only yielded more than sixty catties of lint in total, averaging less than five catties per mu. At this time, he sincerely admitted that there was something wrong with his farming methods, and he realized that old ideas had harmed him. As he said, "Old ideas and old methods don't work anymore. We must learn advanced farming methods for a good harvest!"

### 不相信先进耕作技术  我父亲种的棉花减产了

    不相信先进耕作技术  我父亲种的棉花减产了
    编辑同志：我父亲吴永海种了一辈子庄稼，劳动样样都好。但是，他的保守思想很严重，不相信科学的耕作方法，墨守成规，今年的棉花减产了。
    在种棉花以前，人民政府号召注意棉田保墒工作。村里群众都听了人民政府的话，在每次雨后，耱地一次。但我父亲老是不肯耱。临下种时，天再没有下雨，只得干耱了一次，满地是大土块。在棉花下种时，人民政府号召农民试行“温汤浸种法”。我父亲想：“温汤浸种法再好，咱可没见过，说什么我也不用它！”他还是用老法子播种。人家的棉苗都出齐了，他的棉花才发芽。当时有些老乡说他是吃了老脑筋的亏了，他还半信半疑地说：“迟花收好棉，秋后咱再看！”到了六月间，陕西关中棉田普遍发生了棉蚜虫，棉农们都用各种器械和药械防治害虫。我父亲却说：“靠人治，再治也治不下去，等天下上几场雨，自然就会下去了。”他全然没管棉田里的虫害。棉花开花结蕾时，叶子已被害虫吃光了，花蕾大部分都掉了。棉花成熟了，人家摘的花又白又好，我父亲的棉花色又不白，收量也少。这时，我父亲心中有些想开了。可是，他还不想服输，对群众说：“等摘完花再看吧！”最后事实明显地摆出来了：全乡的棉花每亩平均都收了二十斤左右皮棉，我父亲种的十三亩棉花，一共只收了六十多斤皮棉，每亩平均不到五斤。这时，他才口服心服地承认他的耕作方法有毛病，他才认识了是旧思想害了他。正如他说的：“旧思想旧作法吃不开了，要学习先进耕作方法，庄稼才能丰收！”
