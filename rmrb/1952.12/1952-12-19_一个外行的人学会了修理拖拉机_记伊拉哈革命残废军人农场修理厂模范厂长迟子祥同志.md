    A Layman Learns to Repair Tractors
    —On Comrade Chi Zixiang, Model Director of the Repair Factory of the Yilahazi Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm
    Ding Luxu
    Comrade Chi Zixiang, director of the repair factory of the Yilahazi Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm in Heilongjiang Province, is a revolutionary disabled soldier, an outstanding Communist Party member, and a special-class labor model of Heilongjiang Province.
    Comrade Chi Zixiang is thirty-four years old this year. More than ten years ago, he fled from Shandong to the Northeast begging for food and worked as an apprentice at "Manzhou Electric Power" in Changchun. In 1945, when the Northeast was just liberated, he joined the People's Liberation Army. He participated in many major and arduous battles in the Northeast Liberation War. In the course of more than two years of war, he was credited six times. In 1947, he participated in the Faku Battle in the freezing weather of minus forty degrees Celsius, where all his toes were frozen off, and two fingers were also frozen off. Finally, he was rescued from the front line with five serious injuries.
    After a period of recovery, Comrade Chi Zixiang healed his injuries, but his body was disabled, and he could no longer go to the front line. At this time, he first participated in rear production and was one of the founders of the Yilahazi Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm.
    The Yilahazi Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm is a mechanized farm. In his first year of participating in the construction of the farm—1950—he encountered difficulties: a large number of plows, harrows, and farm tools were broken, and no one knew how to repair them. Comrade Chi Zixiang volunteered to take on this arduous task. In the beginning, he knew nothing. He and several comrades first set up a blacksmith's furnace to learn blacksmithing. They used some scrap iron to study, breaking it once and then trying again. After persistent study, they were soon able to make things like iron rings and hooks; gradually, they learned the entire set of blacksmithing skills.
    Chi Zixiang thought: Only knowing blacksmithing cannot completely solve the problem of repairing farm tools. He began to study new technologies and learned to use oxyhydrogen blowpipes for "gas welding" and other methods. In this way, in the spring of 1950, the ironwork group under his leadership repaired and manufactured more than 1,200 kinds of farm tool parts.
    That summer, the farm had a large construction and transportation task, but there was a shortage of vehicles, and everyone was anxious, but there was no solution. When Chi Zixiang saw some broken car frames in the scrap iron pile and some spare rubber tires for large carts in the warehouse, he called on everyone to make trailers. Many people thought this was an impossible task. Chi Zixiang said, "No matter how difficult it is, we must make it happen, otherwise, the transportation problem for the farm's construction will not be solved." To make trailers, lathes and drilling machines were needed. Although there was an old lathe and an old drilling machine in the farm at that time, there was no power. Chi Zixiang stood next to the lathe and thought: In the early days of the Liberation War, our troops had less than ten bullets per person, but we were still able to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries equipped with American equipment. Today, on the production front, what difficult problems cannot be solved? While thinking, he hung a belt on the lathe and vigorously pulled the belt with his two disabled hands. The lathe immediately started to turn. Everyone was very moved by this scene, and many people had tears in their eyes. Everyone stepped forward to work together, pulling the belt tightly, turning parts, and drilling holes. In this way, an eight-wheeled trailer with a load capacity of more than 10,000 jin was made.
    Although he had learned blacksmithing, gas welding, and trailer manufacturing, the problem of repairing tractors had not yet been solved. In the past, if a small part on a tractor broke, one had to go to Harbin to buy it, and the travel expenses alone were staggering. In order to learn how to repair tractors, Chi Zixiang participated in the major overhaul of tractors, learned about the structure of tractors, and began to study the methods and techniques of repairing tractors. Chi Zixiang first studied the structure of the "Wala inverted pipe," which is a relatively simple but highly needed tractor part. However, researching and manufacturing tractor parts is different from manufacturing parts for general farm tools because if the manufactured parts do not meet the specifications, not only will the tractor not be repaired, but other parts of the tractor will also be damaged. To be cautious, he first smashed the used old parts to check the quality of the pig iron and found that it was the same as the pig iron material he was using. So, he began to turn it on the lathe. The first part he made was installed on the tractor, but the "Wala" was worn out. At this time, everyone suggested not to make it anymore. Chi Zixiang's will was unwavering. He did not sleep all night and researched the reason for the worn-out "Wala." He found that the "Wala inverted pipe" was not precisely manufactured, so he reprocessed it and finally succeeded.
    The successful manufacture of the "Wala inverted pipe" strengthened his confidence in studying new technologies, and also made several other repairmen realize the importance of studying. Next, he and two repairmen further studied the tiling work of the "bearing shell" and "connecting rod bearing shell" on the tractor, which is also a difficult and important task in repairing tractors. At the beginning of their tiling experiments, they failed to mount it four times in a row. After seven or eight experiments, they all failed. What was the reason? They found that the temperature of the "Wujin" was not well controlled. If the temperature was too high, the tin lining would flow out; if the temperature was not high enough, the tin lining would not melt. How to control the temperature? Just when there was no way, everyone was a little discouraged. Comrade Chi Zixiang said to the repairmen, "In front of Communist Party members, in front of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, there are no difficulties that can stop them from advancing." Encouraged by Comrade Chi Zixiang, the repairmen worked together to carefully study and came up with a new method. They used wooden pieces to test the temperature of the "Wujin." When the temperature was not high enough, the wooden piece would not change much when inserted; when the temperature was too high, the wooden piece would burn black as soon as it was inserted. If the wooden piece turned a light yellow color when inserted into the "Wujin," this was the right temperature. In this way, every tile they mounted was successful, and they triumphed again.
    Comrade Chi Zixiang not only worked hard himself, but more importantly, he always paid attention to educating and cultivating the comrades around him. He said, "How much strength can one person have? Only by actively cultivating and mobilizing the strength of the masses can it play a greater role." In the past two or three years, under his training, sixteen comrades in the repair factory have learned blacksmithing, horseshoeing, and repairing farm tools. Repairmen Liu Qinghua and Wu Wenyi, learning from his spirit of research, created a new method for repairing cylinder heads on tractors. Tractor cylinder heads often crack and could not be repaired at all in the past. Buying one would cost five million yuan. Now they can also repair them. This year alone, they have repaired five cylinder heads in this way.
    In early spring this year, the land conditions were not good, and the spring plowing task was very urgent. Every day, a large number of broken machines and farm tools from various sub-farms were sent to the repair factory. Under these urgent circumstances, Comrade Chi Zixiang's repair work always lasted until late at night. Even on snowy nights, people would see the light of gas welding shining in the courtyard of the repair factory. Under the shimmering light, Chi Zixiang, lying on his back in the mud and water under the mechanical farm tools, was using his disabled hands to hold the oxyhydrogen blowpipe and carry out intense gas welding.
    Three years ago, the small blacksmith shop established by Comrade Chi Zixiang of the Yilahazi Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm has now developed into a modern mechanical repair factory; Comrade Chi Zixiang, who knew nothing about machinery, has now become an expert capable of mastering the repair technology of modern agricultural machinery. Due to these achievements, he has been selected as a labor model of the farm every year for the past three years. Last year, he was named a special-class labor model in Heilongjiang Province and attended the All-Northeast Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Labor Model Representative Conference.
    "Today's struggle on the production front will give us a better tomorrow." Chi Zixiang's words have begun to be realized in the Yilahazi Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm. A wilderness of weeds and reeds in "Beidahuang" has become a mechanized farm and a beautiful garden. Comrade Chi Zixiang got married in the farm last year and established a happy family. His family never runs out of new clothes, and they eat rice and white flour every day. In his happy life, when people talk to him about his achievements, he always says: "All achievements are created under the cultivation of the Party. Without the cultivation of the Party, what achievements would I have? Without the Party, I would not have today's happiness. I will never forget the Party's kindness to me; and my contribution to the Party is far from enough!"

    一个外行的人学会了修理拖拉机
    ——记伊拉哈革命残废军人农场修理厂模范厂长迟子祥同志
    丁履枢
    黑龙江省伊拉哈革命残废军人农场修理厂厂长迟子祥同志，是一个革命残废军人，优秀的共产党员，黑龙江省的特等劳动模范。
    迟子祥同志今年三十四岁。十几年前，他从山东讨饭流亡到东北，在长春“满洲电业”当徒工。一九四五年，东北刚刚解放的时候，他就参加了人民解放军。在东北解放战争中，许多主要的艰苦的战役，他都参加了。在两年多的战争过程中，他曾立功六次。一九四七年，他在零下四十度的冰天雪地中，参加法库战役，脚趾全部冻掉了，两个指头也冻掉了，最后他身负五处重伤，才被救下火线。
    经过一个时期，迟子祥同志养好了伤，但他的身体已经残废，不能再上前线了。这时他首先参加了后方生产，他是伊拉哈革命残废军人农场的创始人之一。
    伊拉哈革命残废军人农场是一个机械化的农场。他参加建场的第一年——一九五○年，就遇上了困难：大批的犁耙、农具坏了，没有人会修理。迟子祥同志自报奋勇担负这个艰巨的任务。开头，他什么也不会。他和几个同志先安上一个打铁的炉子，学习打铁。他们用些废铁学习，一次打坏了，二次再打。经过顽强的学习，他们不久就能打铁环、挂勾之类的东西了；慢慢的，他们学会了打铁的全套本领。
    迟子祥想：只会打铁，还不能彻底解决修理农具的问题。他开始钻研新技术，学会了使用氢氧吹管“风焊”等办法。就这样，一九五○年一个春季，在他领导的铁工组修理、制造了一千二百多种农具的零件。
    这年夏天，农场修建运输任务很大，缺乏车辆，大家着急，但没办法。迟子祥看见废铁堆里有些坏车架子，仓库里有些大车上备用的胶皮轮带，他就号召大家制造拖车。许多人认为这是一件不可能的事情。迟子祥说：“不论多么困难，一定要作成，不然农场建设的运输问题就没法解决。”作拖车，要用车床和钻眼床子。当时农场里虽有一台旧的车床和旧的钻眼床，但是没有动力。迟子祥站在车床旁边想：解放战争初期，咱们部队每人不到十粒子弹，还能把美式装备的国民党反动军队打垮，今天在生产战线上，还能有什么困难问题不能解决？他一面想着，一面在车床上挂上了皮带，用两只残废的手，猛力拉动皮带，车床立刻转动起来了。大家看到这种情景，很受感动，许多人眼眶里流出了热泪。大家上前一齐动起手来，紧张地拉皮带，镟零件，钻眼子，就这样制成了一架载重一万多斤的八轮大拖车。
    虽然学会了打铁、风焊、造拖车，但还没有解决拖拉机的修理问题。以前，拖拉机上坏一个小零件，也要跑到哈尔滨去买，旅运费一项就很惊人。为了学习修理拖拉机，迟子祥参加了拖拉机的大检修工作，了解了拖拉机的构造，开始钻研了修理拖拉机的方法和技术。迟子祥首先研究了“瓦拉倒管”的构造，这是一种比较简单的但是需用量很大的拖拉机零件。但是研究制造拖拉机的零件，和制造一般农具上的零件不一样，因为制造出来的零件如果不合规格，不但修理不好拖拉机，而且还要损坏拖拉机的其他部分。为了慎重起见他先把用废的旧零件砸碎，检查生铁质量，结果发现和自己用的生铁料子一样。于是他就开始用车床镟制。他第一次造出来的零件，安装到拖拉机上，结果把“瓦拉”磨坏了，这时大家提出不同意再制。迟子祥的意志却坚定不移，他一夜不曾睡觉，研究出了磨坏“瓦拉”的原因，是“瓦拉倒管”制造的规格不精密，于是他重新加工，终于成功。
    “瓦拉倒管”的制造成功，使他更坚定了钻研新技术的信心，同时也使另外几个修理工认识了钻研学习的重要。接着他又和两个修理工进一步研究了拖拉机上“坐瓦”和“甩子瓦”的挂瓦工作，这也是修理拖拉机的一项困难的重要的工作。他们开头试验挂瓦，一连挂四次挂不上，经过七、八次的试验都失败了。这是什么原因呢？他们发现是“乌金”的温度没掌握好，温度高了，把锡里子流了出去；温度不够，锡里子化不开。如何掌握温度呢？正在没办法的时候，大家都有些灰心。迟子祥同志向修理工们说：“在共产党员面前，在解放军的战士面前，没有能阻挡住他们前进的困难。”在迟子祥同志的鼓舞下，修理工们又在一起精心钻研，想出了一个新的办法。他们用木片试验“乌金”温度。温度不够的时候，把木片插进去不大变色，温度高了，木片一插就烧黑了，如果木片插到“乌金”里变成一种淡黄色，这就是温度恰好。这样挂起瓦来，挂一个成一个，结果他们又胜利了。
    迟子祥同志，不但自己艰苦奋斗，更重要的是他时刻注意教育培养在他周围的同志们。他说：“一个人能有多少力量呢？只有积极培养和发动了大伙的力量，才会更起作用。”两三年来，在他的培养下，修理厂里，已经有十六个同志学会了打铁、挂马掌、修理农具。修理工刘庆华、吴文义，学习了他的钻研精神，创造了修理拖拉机上气缸盖的新办法。拖拉机的气缸盖，常会炸裂，以前根本无法修理，买一个要用五百万元。现在他们也能修理了，今年一年他们就这样修好了五个缸盖。
    今年初春，土地情况不好，春耕任务又很紧急，每天各个分场大批的坏机器和坏农具送到修理厂来，在这种紧迫的情况下，迟子祥同志每天的修理工作，总是要到深夜。就是在大雪纷纷的深夜，人们也会看到修理厂的院子里，闪耀着风焊的火光。在闪闪的亮光底下，照耀着迟子祥仰卧在泥水里的机械农具底下，用他那双残废的手，拿着氢氧吹管在紧张的风焊。
    三年前，伊拉哈革命残废军人农场迟子祥同志建立的小铁匠炉，今年已经发展成一座现代化的机械修理厂了；迟子祥同志从一点机械也不懂，今天也已成为能够掌握现代化农业机械修理技术的能手。由于这样的成就，三年来每年他都被评选为农场的劳动模范，去年在全黑龙江省被评为特等劳动模范，并且出席了全东北的革命残废军人劳动模范代表大会。
    “今天生产战线上的奋斗，会给我们更美好的明天。”迟子祥的这句话，在伊拉哈革命残废军人农场里开始实现了，“北大荒”的一片荒草野甸，变成了一个机械农场，变成了一座美丽的花园了。迟子祥同志去年在农场里结了婚，建立了幸福的家庭，他的家庭，新衣穿不完，天天吃着大米白面。在幸福的生活里，人们跟他谈起他的成绩的时候，他总常是这样说：“一切成绩，都是在党的培养之下创造出来的，没有党的培养，我会有什么成绩呢？没有党，我也不会有今天的幸福，党对我的恩情，我永远不会忘记；而我对党的贡献，还差得太多呢！”
