    Plant the Flag of Michurin Biological Science on the Land of New China
    —Thanking Soviet Biologists for Their Help
    Chen Fengtong, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization
    Since the lectures given by Soviet biologists Dr. Nuzhdin and Professor Stoletov in China, a wave of enthusiasm for studying Michurin biological science has formed in China's biological circles. Subsequently, Soviet agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and veterinary experts have been continuously invited to China to hold lectures, reports, and training courses, gradually elevating China's biological scientific thinking and agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry construction undertakings to a new stage. This time, the Soviet biological and agricultural experts, including Grusenko and Belosapko, who came to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," have traveled all over the north and south of New China, promoting Michurin's biological theories everywhere, which has played a huge role in promoting the improvement of Chinese biological scientific work.
    Michurin creatively developed Darwin's materialist biological theory, enabling Soviet socialist agricultural construction to achieve brilliant achievements. The design of the great Stalin's plan for transforming nature, especially the grass-arable rotation system, has become a huge action for millions of Soviet working people. They have skillfully mastered this comprehensive science and technology and are carrying out unprecedented work to transform nature. The All-Soviet biological community, headed by Academician Lysenko, inherits Michurin's scientific cause and continues to develop it. The famous theory of plant stage development was founded by Academician Lysenko. Now, the theories of vernalization and photoperiodism in plant stage development have been widely applied to production. Every new discovery and invention of theirs is quickly applied to economic construction, creating huge wealth for the country and increasing infinite happiness for the people. Today, the Soviet Union has basically eliminated disasters such as waterlogging, drought, diseases, and insect pests, as well as infectious diseases in animal husbandry and other natural disasters, ensuring stable and abundant harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry and ensuring the smooth completion of the socialist planned economy. The cultivation of Soviet winter wheat and cotton is expanding to new areas that were previously considered unsuitable for cultivation, and the planting of fruit trees and vegetables has expanded from the European part to Siberia and near the Arctic Circle. Soviet agricultural and animal husbandry output is still increasing. Varieties that require 100 quintals of wheat per hectare and dairy cows that produce 16,000 liters of milk per year are being researched and cultivated. All Soviet biological scientists are conducting new research to welcome the great communist construction.
    Our large-scale new construction is about to begin, which will gradually provide conditions for the collectivization and mechanization of agriculture in New China. In the future, along with the progress of this great construction undertaking, we will inevitably gradually carry out the work of transforming nature, and we will gradually build protective forest belts and implement a grass-arable rotation system on a large scale throughout the country. This first requires the widespread and planned organization of scientific workers to conduct investigations and research, in order to thoroughly understand the existing tree species, fruit tree species, and their propagation and cultivation methods available for transforming nature in various parts of China, and to understand the perennial gramineous and leguminous pastures needed for the implementation of the grass-arable rotation system, as well as a large number of excellent seeds of agricultural crops and industrial raw material crops and their regionalized cultivation methods. More importantly, the implementation of the grass-arable rotation system will provide conditions for the large-scale development of animal husbandry, which urgently requires us to research and breed a large number of regional excellent livestock breeds, and to research and improve their breeding methods and feeding management methods. Our motherland's land is extremely vast, and its products are extremely rich, but the scientific undertakings left over from the old society are extremely backward. There are many categories of agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry products in our country, but the cultivation and breeding methods are still very unscientific; pasture seeds, especially perennial gramineous pastures, are very lacking, all of which are far from meeting the current requirements of production and construction and the large needs of the future agricultural collectivization and mechanization system. We need to start from scratch and reorganize and study these. Therefore, we must accelerate the study of Michurin's theory and Soviet advanced experience. Only in this way can we shorten working time and catch up with the urgent needs of new construction.
    We sincerely thank the Soviet scientists and biologists for their highly enthusiastic help. We are determined to learn Michurin's and Lysenko's biology, establish and develop a Michurin work team in New China, to repay Comrade Stalin, and to repay the Soviet working people and the Soviet scientific community for their ardent hopes for us.

    把米丘林生物科学的旗帜树立在新中国的大地上
    ——感谢苏联生物学家对我们的帮助
    中华全国科学技术普及协会全国委员会副主席  陈凤桐
    自苏联生物学家努日金博士、斯托列托夫教授在中国讲学之后，我国生物学界对米丘林生物科学的学习就形成了热潮。接着苏联农业、林业、牧业、及兽医专家不断应聘到我国来举行讲演会、报告会和讲习班，把我国生物科学思想和农业、林业、牧业建设事业逐渐提高到一个新的阶段。这次为参加“中苏友好月”而来到中国的苏联生物学、农学专家格鲁森科、别洛沙普柯等，又走遍新中国的南北各地，到处宣传米丘林生物学说，对于改进中国生物科学工作，起了巨大的推动作用。
    米丘林创造性地发展了达尔文唯物主义生物学理论，使苏联社会主义农业建设获得了辉煌的成就。伟大的斯大林改造大自然计划的设计，特别是其中的草谷轮作制，已成为苏联千百万劳动人民的巨大行动。他们熟练地掌握了这一综合性的科学技术，进行着史无前例的改造大自然的工作。以李森科院士为首的全苏联生物学界，继承着米丘林的科学事业，并使它不断向前发展。有名的植物阶段发育的理论，就是李森科院士所创立的。现在植物阶段发育中的春化、光化理论，已被广泛应用到生产上去。他们每一件新的发现和发明，都很快被应用到经济建设事业上，为国家创造巨大的财富，为人民增加无限的幸福。苏联今天已基本上免去水、旱、病、虫等灾害和畜牧业上的传染病，以及其他自然界的灾害，保证了农牧业的稳定丰收，保证了社会主义计划经济的顺利完成。苏联冬小麦、棉花的栽培正向新的过去认为不能栽培的地区扩展，果树、蔬菜的种植已由欧洲部分扩展到西伯利亚，扩展到北极圈附近。苏联农牧业产量还在不断提高。要求每公顷产一百公担的小麦品种和年产一万六千公升牛奶的奶牛，品种正在被研究培育着。苏联的一切生物科学工作者都正在进行新的研究，以迎接伟大的共产主义建设。
    我国大规模新的建设即将开始，它将逐渐为新中国农业的集体化机械化提供条件。今后，随着这一伟大的建设事业的进行，我们必然要逐步进行改造大自然的工作，我们将在全国范围内逐步大规模营造防护林带和实行草谷轮作制。这首先须要广泛地有计划地组织科学工作者来进行调查研究，以期彻底了解我国各地现有的可供改造大自然用的林木树种、果树种和它们的繁殖栽培法、了解各地现有可供实行草谷轮作制所需要的多年生禾本科、豆科牧草以及大量优良的农作物、工业原料作物的种子和它们的区域化的栽培法。更重要的是，草谷轮作制的推行，将为畜牧业的大量发展提供条件，这就迫切要求我们研究和繁殖大量区域性牲畜优良品种，并研究和改进其繁殖法和饲养管理法。我们祖国的土地是极其辽阔广大的，物产也是极其丰富的，但旧社会所遗留下来的科学事业是极其落后的。我国农、林、牧各业产品类别繁多，而耕作栽培和饲养繁殖的方法还很不科学；牧草种子，特别是多年生禾本科牧草十分缺少，这一切都远不能适应当前生产建设的要求和将来农业集体化、机械化制度下的大量需要。这些，我们都需要从头作起，需要从头加以整理和研究。因此，我们必须加速学习米丘林学说和苏联先进经验。只有这样，才能缩短工作时间，迎头赶上新建设的迫切需要。
    我们衷心感谢苏联科学家、生物学家对我们的高度热情的帮助，我们决心学好米丘林、李森科的生物学，建立和发展新中国的米丘林工作大队，以答谢斯大林同志，答谢苏联劳动人民和苏联科学界对我们的殷切希望。    （新华社）
