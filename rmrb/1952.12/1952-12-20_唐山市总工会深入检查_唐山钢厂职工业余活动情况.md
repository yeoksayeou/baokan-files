Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Conducts In-depth Inspection
Tangshan Steel Plant Employee After-Work Activities

Comrade Editor: Recently, we investigated the actual situation of employees' after-work collective activities at the Tangshan Steel Plant's steelmaking department. The survey results show that although Tangshan Steel Plant is a factory in Tangshan City with relatively standardized production and work systems, and the plant and workshops have cadres detached from production to do Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League work, the problem of excessively long after-work collective activities, too many meetings, and cadres holding too many concurrent positions is still very serious.

In July of this year, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to protect the health of employees, formulated the "Decision on the Distribution of Employees' After-Work Activities in Factories and Mines," stipulating that the weekly after-work collective activity time for employees should not exceed twelve hours. Tangshan Steel Plant also specifically stipulated various meeting systems according to the instructions of the Municipal Committee. However, in reality, these meeting systems are often disrupted, and the Municipal Committee's decision has not been seriously implemented.

The working hours of the steelmaking department are based on a three-shift system, day and night. Among the one hundred and seventy-three workers on the night shift, forty-six have more than twelve hours of after-work collective activity time per week; most of those who do not exceed twelve hours are because they do not participate in cultural studies. Some Party members, Youth League members, and activists often have about twenty hours of after-work collective activity time per week. This situation is even more serious among foremen, shift leaders, and some non-production-detached cadres with concurrent positions. They generally spend sixteen hours a day at the factory, and some even spend seventeen or eighteen hours. For example, shift leader Tian Yigong holds concurrent positions as a member of the Party General Branch, secretary of the Party Branch, and member of the factory trade union. He is so busy that he can barely breathe, and can only sleep five or six hours a day. Foreman Cui Zhu holds seven concurrent positions. In addition to working eight hours, sleeping six hours, and eating, he spends almost all of his time in meetings and doing other things. Worker Liu Guangshun of the casting team holds six concurrent positions. One day, his activities were as follows: woke up at 5:00, entered the factory at 5:35, produced from 6:00 to 14:00, attended three meetings after work, exchanged opinions on production with workers, returned home at 23:30, and organized propaganda materials until 24:40 before going to sleep. He still woke up at 5:00 the next day. That day, he only slept for more than four hours. This situation occurs seven or eight times a month. Chen Yongfu, chairman of the steelmaking department's workshop trade union, attended eighteen meetings in five days, occupying thirty hours of after-work activity time.

The serious situation of excessively long after-work collective activity time for employees not only harms their health and deprives them of guarantees for political, cultural, and technical studies, but also directly affects production and work. Sixty percent of the workers in the steelmaking department live far from the factory and have to walk more than two hours to and from work every day; they spend a long time at the factory, working hard for eight hours, followed by meetings, which make them exhausted and often unable to get enough rest. Excessive fatigue cannot be restored, so they do not have enough energy to engage in production. Yuan Kejian of the ingot-making team suffered from neurasthenia due to overwork. He said, "I don't have any energy to work, but all the tasks are important, and I can't do without any of them. I'll just keep going until I collapse." Since the launch of the "Three-Anti" movement, cultural studies in the steelmaking department have not been regularized. Only sixty-eight of the one hundred and seventy-three workers in the department participate in cultural studies; about sixty-one percent of the workers are supposed to enroll but have not, because they are too busy with after-work collective activities. Technical studies lack leadership, there is no dedicated lecturer, and the meetings mostly focus on discussing general production issues, wasting time and failing to learn technology. In addition, more than ninety percent of the workers do not have time to read newspapers and study, which seriously affects their political progress.

Why has the problem of employees' after-work activity time at Tangshan Steel Plant not been reasonably resolved for a long time? First of all, the leading cadres of the plant have not ideologically recognized the importance of solving this problem. After the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on solving the problem of allocating after-work activity time for factory and mine employees in July of this year, the plant did not seriously implement the decision. Although it also stipulated a meeting system, it lacked inspection and in-depth, specific leadership, so the system was left to its own devices. Secondly, the situation of cadres holding too many concurrent positions and too many chaotic meetings is a direct cause of excessive after-work collective activity time for employees. Many meetings in the plant lack planning and reasonable arrangements, often leading to repetitive content; in addition, there is not enough preparation before meetings, which are held loosely and waste a lot of time. Sometimes, several meetings are held at the same time, leaving workers overwhelmed and confused. Some workers reflect, "Attending meetings is more tiring than working. I'd rather work for two hours than attend a two-hour meeting."

From this investigation, we feel that reasonably solving the problem of employees' after-work activity time is not only an urgent demand of the workers, but also a crucial key to whether or not we can improve factory and mine production and work. The phenomenon of excessively long after-work collective activity time for employees is so serious at Tangshan Steel Plant, where production and work systems are relatively standardized; in other factories in Tangshan City, this situation may be even more serious, which is a matter of great concern.

Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

Editor's Note: The Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' working method of conducting in-depth and systematic inspections of key areas is good, and it is of decisive significance in the struggle against bureaucracy and formalism. Through this inspection, we not only learned about the actual situation of employees' after-work activity time at Tangshan Steel Plant, but also learned about the implementation of the Municipal Committee's decision in the plant. In order to ensure the health of factory and mine employees, many local Party organizations have issued decisions on reasonably allocating employees' after-work activity time; however, judging from the situation reflected in letters from the masses to this newspaper, many regions have not seriously implemented them. We suggest that Party organizations that have already attached importance to solving this problem and have issued decisions must conduct in-depth, regular, and systematic inspection work to ensure the correct implementation of the decisions. As for areas that have not yet attached importance to solving this problem, they must put solving this problem on the agenda of Party organizations. We ask Party organizations, trade unions, and workers in various places to regularly and continuously write to us about the actual situation, specific solutions, problems encountered in the process of solving the problem, and experiences and lessons learned in your area or factory and mine regarding similar problems.

### 唐山市总工会深入检查  唐山钢厂职工业余活动情况

    唐山市总工会深入检查
    唐山钢厂职工业余活动情况
    编辑同志：最近，我们调查了唐山钢厂炼钢部的职工业余集体活动时间的实际情况。调查结果证明：唐山钢厂虽然是唐山市生产、工作制度比较正规的工厂，厂和车间都有脱离生产的干部做党、行政、工会、青年团的工作，但是，职工业余集体活动时间过长，会议太多，干部兼职过多的情形仍然十分严重。
    今年七月，中共唐山市委员会为了保护职工身体健康，拟订了“关于厂矿职工业余活动支配问题的决定”，规定职工业余集体活动时间每周不得超过十二小时。唐山钢厂根据市委的指示也具体地规定了各种会议制度。但实际上，这些会议制度经常被打乱，市委的决定并没有认真贯彻。
    炼钢部工作时间是昼夜三班制。夜班一百七十三个工人中，有四十六人每周业余集体活动时间在十二小时以上；没有超过十二小时的人大都是因为没有参加文化学习。有些党、团员和积极分子每周业余集体活动时间经常在二十小时左右。在工长、值班长及一些不脱离生产的兼职干部中，这种情况更为严重，他们每天在厂时间一般为十六小时，也有多到十七、八小时的。如：值班长田以功兼党总支委员、党支部书记、厂工会委员等职，整天忙的喘不过气来，第天只能睡五、六个小时的觉。大工长崔柱身兼七职，每天除了工作八小时，睡觉六小时和吃饭时间以外，几乎全部在开会和搞别的事情。浇注组工人刘广顺身兼六职，有一天，他的活动是：五时起床，五时三十五分进厂，六至十四时生产，下班后开了三个会，又和工人交换了生产上的意见，二十三时三十分回家，回家后还整理了宣传材料，直到二十四时四十分才睡觉。第二天仍然五时起床。这天，他只睡了四个多小时。这种情况每月有七、八次。炼钢部车间工会主席陈永富，在五天内就参加了十八个会，占用业余活动时间三十小时。
    职工业余集体活动时间过长的严重情况，不仅损害了职工健康，使他们的政治、文化、技术等学习失去保证，而且也直接影响了生产和工作。炼钢部有百分之六十的工人因为宿舍离工厂远，每天上下班来回要走两个多小时；在厂的时间又很长，紧张地劳动了八点钟，接着就是开会，弄得工人精疲力尽，经常得不到足够的休息。过度的疲劳不能恢复，也就没有充沛的精神从事生产。造块组袁克俭由于过渡疲劳，害了神经衰弱症。他说：“我干起活来没有一点劲，可是各项工作都重要，那一样不做也不行，多时倒了多时说，现在只好顶着干。”炼钢部从开展“三反”运动以来，文化学习一直没有走上正规。该部一百七十三个工人中仅有六十八人参加文化学习；约有百分之六十一的工人是应入学而未入学的，他们因业余集体活动时间过长，忙不过来。技术学习缺乏领导，没有专人讲课，开会多停在讨论一般的生产问题上，浪费了时间，学不到技术。此外，百分之九十以上的工人，根本没有读报学习的时间，严重地影响了他们的政治上的进步。
    唐山钢厂职工业余活动时间问题为什么长期没有得到合理解决呢？首先是该厂领导干部没有从思想上认识到解决这一问题的重要意义。今年七月，中共唐山市委员会对解决厂矿业余活动时间支配问题的指示发出以后，该厂没有认真执行决定，虽然也规定了会议制度，但由于缺乏检查，没有深入的具体领导，这个制度也就自流了。其次，干部兼职过多，会议又多又乱的情况，是直接造成职工业余集体活动时间过多的原因。该厂有很多会议由于缺乏计划，没有合理安排，常常发生内容重复的现象；再加上会前没有充分准备，开起会来松松散散，浪费了很多时间。有时几个会议同时进行，工人顾东顾不了西，十分忙乱。有些工人反映：“开会比活还累，叫我开两小时会，不如让我做两小时工。”
    从这次调查中，我们感到合理解决职工业余活动时间的问题，不仅是工人们的迫切要求，同时也是当前能否搞好厂矿生产和工作的重要关键。唐山钢厂在生产、工作制度都比较正规的情况下，职工业余集体活动时间过长的现象尚如此严重；在唐山市其他工厂中，这种情况恐更加严重，这是十分值得注意的问题。
                    唐山市总工会
    编者按：唐山市总工会深入重点进行系统检查的工作方法是好的，这在反对官僚主义和形式主义的斗争中是有决定意义的。经过这次检查，不仅了解到唐山钢厂职工业余活动时间的实际情况，而且也知道了市委决定在该厂贯彻的情况。为了保证厂矿职工的健康，许多地区党组织都发布了合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定；但从群众给本报的来信所反映的情况看，不少地区并没有认真贯彻。我们建议已经重视解决这个问题并发布了决定的党组织，还须深入、经常、系统地进行检查工作，以保证决定的正确贯彻。至于还没有重视解决这个问题的地区，必须把解决这个问题提到党组织的议事日程上来。我们要求各地党组织、工会和职工群众，经常不断地将你们所在地区或厂矿类似这个问题的实际情况、具体解决办法、解决过程中所发生的问题和经验教训，写信告诉我们。
