    The Strongest Person - Volunteer Army Combat Hero Zhang Weiliang
    Volunteer Army, A certain unit Political Department
    Zhang Weiliang, an outstanding son of the motherland, was wounded in six places, crawled for ten days and nine nights, and finally returned to his unit victoriously. This strongest person has been awarded the honorary title of Second-Class Combat Hero by the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    Zhang Weiliang was a soldier of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. On the evening of April 30, 1952, while returning from a surprise attack on the enemy after completing their mission, he and another comrade stepped on the enemy's mine in order to rescue a wounded soldier. His left femur was broken by the blast, and his chest was also injured. This was behind the enemy's second barbed wire fence. He gave the wounded soldier and his own gun to the comrade who came with him, telling them to leave quickly, and that he would crawl slowly behind. He said: "Don't let me delay you. As long as I have a breath, I will crawl back! If I encounter the enemy, I will use grenades to fight them!"
    After the wounded comrade was carried away, he began to crawl back. The pain of the wound made it impossible for him to turn over, so he had to lie on his back, using his two hands and right leg to support his body, head first and feet last, like a backstroke swimmer, moving back inch by inch. He placed the grenades on both sides of his chest, moving them forward each step. After crawling fifty meters, it dawned. He had to crawl into a dry ditch to hide, and the weeds and small trees helped prevent him from being discovered by the enemy. At this time, he discovered that his cotton clothes and jacket had been torn in many places. He pulled out a handkerchief from his belt, and a piece of broken femur, about two inches long, was also pulled out. He was glad that his femoral artery had not been injured. He untied his first-aid kit and bandaged the wound, then began to plan his actions.
    He planned: hide and rest during the day, crawl at night. If the enemy discovered him, he would first kill a few of them with the first grenade, and then use the second to perish together with the enemy.
    After making the plan, he leaned against the ditch, wanting to tear up all his family letters and notebooks. Inside the notebook was a picture of Chairman Mao. The morning light shone through the trees onto Chairman Mao's face, making him look even more kind and amiable. He gazed at it, and a tide of emotion welled up in his heart. He seemed to hear Chairman Mao saying to him: "Comrade, be strong, everything will be alright." He said silently to Chairman Mao: "No matter what difficulties, I must go back alive!" To make crawling easier, he found two small wooden sticks, two feet long.
    After dark, he moved back, lying on his back, in the direction he had identified during the day, using the light columns above Panmunjom as a guide. After crawling more than ten meters, he encountered the enemy's barbed wire. He used the wooden sticks to prop himself up and barely crawled under it. After passing the barbed wire, he crawled for about fifty meters, and a small river blocked his path. Although the river was only two or three feet wide and not deep, it was difficult for a person who was wounded in six places and had not eaten anything for two days and two nights to crawl across. He no longer had the strength to crawl, so he lay down in the grass on the riverbed to rest.
    After dusk on the third day, enduring the pain all over his body and the extreme fatigue, he found three wooden sticks more than one meter long in the dim moonlight along the riverbed. Then he laid the wooden sticks horizontally across the river, put the grenades in his pockets, and placed his injured left leg, head, and left half of his body on the raft; the right half of his body was close to the water surface, and then he stretched and contracted his right leg and right hand in the water, inch by inch, and crossed the river. After crossing the river, extreme fatigue and the pain of the wound caused him to collapse in the grass after crawling a few steps.
    On the fourth day, the sun's scorching heat and the shrill sound of artillery fire awakened him from his coma. Although his body was very tired, he felt very calm in his heart. Using the concealment of the riverbed weeds and small trees, he took off his cotton clothes, which were soaked by dew and river water, and let the sun dry them. At this time, the wound was badly festering, and pus and blood were constantly flowing outwards, and countless flies were vying to eat. Maggots were constantly drilling in the wound, making the pain even worse. He sat up, using his left hand to drive away the flies, and his right hand to remove the maggots from the wound with small twigs, then bandaged the wound and lay down to rest.
    On the fifth day, after climbing up the riverbed and turning a corner, he encountered the enemy's mined area. As soon as he crawled through the barbed wire, his right hand touched a small iron wire. Realizing that this was the enemy's mined area, he circled along the mine line for three or four hours, but still couldn't get out of the minefield. This made him very angry, and he cursed fiercely: "I'll dig it out before I go." He bit off the iron wire with his teeth, felt the mine, removed the detonator, and then slipped through the gap. A heavy rain began to fall in the second half of the night. The wind and rain soaked his clothes, making the wound even more swollen and painful. All was pitch black before him. He thought of the serious difficulties, but soon remembered the past thirty-one years, which filled him with strength again and made him strong.
    In the old society, his family didn't have a single piece of land, lived in a dilapidated temple, and never had enough to eat all year round. Ten years ago, the landlord forced his father to death, and from then on, the burden of the family fell on his shoulders... Life forced him to give away his own daughter... After liberation, he was allocated land and a house, and the whole family was happy. After the summer harvest last year, he and his eighteen-year-old brother, Zhang Weixing, were the first to sign up to join the Volunteer Army. The two brothers were in the same company. Before leaving, his mother told him: "Take good care of your brother and make contributions for the motherland..."
    The bitter past and the fighting today made him think of the happy tomorrow, forgetting fatigue, hunger, and pain... He silently said to himself again: "I cannot die when I shouldn't die, I must go back alive. Even if I die, I want the people of the motherland to know how I died."
    After the rain cleared, he gazed at the early morning red and blue sky, then sat up and observed the terrain. "Why is this area so familiar?" He was overjoyed. He clearly knew that if he followed this ditch for another hundred meters or so and turned a corner, he would be able to see his own position.
    The closer he got to his position, the more difficulties there were, but the more nervous and excited he became, and the stronger his confidence became; therefore, the difficulties were not so important. When thirsty, he drank urine. If there was no urine to drink, he licked the morning dew with his tongue. His stomach was sunken in, and he couldn't keep his cotton pants up, so he put the belt around his neck. Later, his hands and elbows were also bloody, and his buttocks were worn out. Despite this, he continued to crawl when he woke up after fainting. In this way, seventy meters, fifty meters, thirty meters... the journey was shortened day by day.
    On the morning of the tenth day, the sound of exploding shells woke him up from his coma again. He finally saw his own position. He excitedly perked up his spirits, struggled to climb onto a mound, took off his cotton coat, turned the white lining towards his own position, and waved his handkerchief frequently towards his own position, hoping that his comrades would see the signal and come to rescue him.
    The comrades in the company were worried about him day and night. They scouted on the mountain during the day and went down the mountain to search at night. Everyone firmly believed that as long as he was still alive, he would definitely come back.
    That day, instructor Guo Baoxiang went to the front of the position to observe as usual and spotted him through binoculars. He sent stretchers to carry him back.
    In this way, this soldier, who had been away from the unit for ten days and nine nights, finally returned to his "home" victoriously. When everyone woke him up from his coma, a joyful smile appeared on his haggard face. He said to everyone in a hoarse and weak voice: "I didn't lose anything I brought, I'm back alive!"

    最坚强的人——志愿军战斗英雄张渭良
    志愿军某部政治部
    张渭良，祖国的优秀儿女，他负伤六处，爬行十天九夜，最后胜利归队。这个最坚强的人，已荣获志愿军政治部授予的二级战斗英雄光荣称号。
    张渭良是志愿军某部五连的战士。一九五二年四月三十日晚上，奇袭敌人完成任务归来时，他和另一同志为了抢救一个伤员，踏响了敌人的地雷。他的左腿股骨被炸断，胸部也负了伤。这里是在敌人阵地第二道铁丝网的后面。他把伤员和自己的枪交给同来的那个同志，让他们快走，自己慢慢在后面爬。他说：“你们不要因为我误事，只要有一口气，我就要爬回去！如果碰到敌人，我就用手榴弹跟他们拚！”
    负伤的同志被背走后，他开始往回爬。伤口的疼痛，使他没法翻转身来，只好仰卧着，用两只手和右腿支持着身体，头在前脚在后，像游泳时仰游的姿势一样，一寸一寸地往回移动。手榴弹放在胸膛两侧，每前进一步移动一次。爬了五十公尺，天亮了。他只好爬到一个干涸了的水沟里去隐蔽，野草和小树帮助他不致被敌人发觉。这时，他才发现棉衣棉袄被炸破了很多地方。他顺手从腰带上抽出手巾，一块被打断了的约有二寸长的股骨也被带了出来。他庆幸自己大动脉没有打伤，他解开救急包将伤口包好，然后开始计划自己的行动。
    他计划着：白天隐蔽、休息，晚上爬。如果敌人发觉，先用第一颗手榴弹杀死他们几个，再用第二个跟敌人同归于尽。
    计划好了以后，他就靠着沟旁斜坐起来，想把所有家信、笔记本一一撕毁。笔记本里面，贴着毛主席的照片。晨光透过树林照在毛主席的脸上，显得更加慈祥、亲切。他凝视着，感情的潮水涌上心头。他仿佛听见毛主席在向他说：“同志，坚强起来，一切都会好的。”他暗自向着毛主席说：“什么困难都没关系，我一定要活着回去！”为了爬行方便，他找了两根二尺长的小木棒。
    天黑以后，他朝着白天辨明了的方向，借着板门店上空的光柱，又开始仰卧移动。爬了十多公尺，碰上了敌人的铁丝网，他用木棒顶着好容易从底下钻了过来。过了铁丝网，又爬了约有五十公尺，一道小河又拦住了他。小河虽然只有二、三尺宽，水也不深，但是对于一个负伤六处、两天两夜没吃一点东西的人来说，要再爬过去确是一件难事。他已没有力量再爬了，就躺在河床上的草丛里休息。
    第三天黄昏以后，他忍受着周身的疼痛和无比的疲乏，在矇矇月光下，沿着河床找来了三根一公尺多长的小木棍。然后把木棍横架在河上，把手榴弹塞在口袋里，再把受伤的左腿、头部和身体的左半边放在木排上；身体的右半边贴着水面，然后用右腿和右手在水里一曲一伸，一寸一寸地蠕动，渡过了小河。过河以后，极度的疲劳与伤口的疼痛使他没爬几步，就昏倒在草丛里。
    第四天，烈日的蒸晒和炮声的尖啸，把他从昏迷中催醒了。他的身体虽然很疲乏，但心里却很镇静。借着河床野草和小树的隐蔽，他脱下被露水和河水渗湿了的棉衣，让太阳晒干。这时伤口已经溃烂得很厉害了，脓水和血水不断地向外流，无数的苍蝇在恣意争吃。伤口内的蛆不住地乱钻，伤口更加疼痛。他仰坐起来，左手拿树叶赶苍蝇，右手用小树枝把伤口里的小蛆一团团地向外挖，然后再包好伤口躺下休息。
    第五天，爬上河床，转弯后，便碰上了敌人的布雷区。刚钻过铁丝网，右手就触到了一条小铁丝。他意识到这是敌人的布雷区后，就沿着地雷线绕了三四个小时，却始终没有绕出雷区。这可把他气坏了，他狠狠地骂了一声：“老子挖掉你再走。”他用牙齿咬断了铁丝，摸到地雷跟前，取出信管，然后便从缝隙中溜过去。下半夜下起了大雨。风雨淋湿了他的衣服，使伤口更加肿大和疼痛。眼前是漆黑一团，他想到了严重的困难，但很快又想起了三十一年来的往事，使他又充满了力量，坚强起来。
    他在旧社会时，家里没有一分地，住着破庙，终年不得饱暖。十年前地主逼死了他爹，从此家庭的重担就落在了他的肩上……。生活逼迫着他，将亲生女儿送了人……。解放后，他分到了土地和房子，全家欢乐。去年夏收后，便带着十八岁的弟弟张渭兴，首先报名参加了志愿军。兄弟俩同在一个连队里。临别时母亲嘱咐他：“带好弟弟为祖国立功……。”
    苦难的过去，战斗的今天，使他想起了幸福的明天，忘却了疲劳、饥饿、疼痛……。他又默默地对自己说：“我不能在不该死的时候死去，我一定要活着回去。即是死，也要让祖国人民知道我是怎样死的。”
    雨过天晴，他凝视着那早晨微红而碧蓝的天空，然后仰坐起来观察地形。“这一带地形怎么这样面熟。”他一阵高兴。他清楚地知道沿着这条水沟再走百来公尺，转一个弯，就能看见自己的阵地了。
    离自己的阵地越近，困难越多，但是心情也越紧张越兴奋，信心也越强；因此，困难也越不算什么。口渴时喝尿，没有尿喝，就用舌头舐早晨的露珠。肚皮低凹下去，棉裤穿不住了，他就把裤带套在脖子上。到后来，双手和双肘也磨得血淋淋，屁股上也磨出了血。尽管如此，他还是在昏后醒来时，继续爬行。就这样，七十公尺，五十公尺，三十公尺……一天一天缩短了行程。
    第十天的清晨，炮弹的爆炸声又把他从昏迷中震醒过来。他终于看到了自己的阵地。他兴奋地振起精神，挣扎着爬上了一个土堆，把棉衣脱掉，用白色的衣里朝向自己的阵地，并用手巾频频地向自己阵地摆动，希望自己同志看见这个信号后来救他。
    连队的同志日夜都在为他着急。同志们白天在山头侦察，晚上下山去寻找。大家深信只要他还活着，就一定会回来的。
    这天，教导员郭宝祥同志照例到阵地前去观察，从望远镜里发现了他。派担架把他抬了回来。
    就这样，这个离开部队十天九夜的战士，终于胜利地回到了自己的“家”。当大家把他从昏迷中叫醒时，他的憔悴的脸孔上泛起了喜悦的笑容。他用嘶哑而低微的声音向大家说：“我带的东西一点也没有丢失，我活着回来了！”
