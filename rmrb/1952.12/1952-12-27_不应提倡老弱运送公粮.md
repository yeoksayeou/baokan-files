    It is inappropriate to encourage the old and weak to transport public grain
    Editor: On October 31st, the Jiangxi Daily published a news item entitled "Taibao Township in Linchuan County Organizes Collective Grain Delivery." The news item stated: "Taibao Township, District One of Linchuan County, organized a grain delivery team of 635 people, including thirty-odd elderly farmers in their seventies and children of fourteen or fifteen years old...." Article 9 of the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax Collection Operations" issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government stipulates: "...It is strictly forbidden for the old, weak, disabled, sick, pregnant women, and unqualified livestock to participate in transportation...". The purpose is to avoid casualties. The Jiangxi Daily did not base its report on the government's policy, point out the error of allowing elderly farmers in their seventies and children of fourteen or fifteen years old to participate in grain delivery, but instead promoted the fact of the old and weak transporting public grain in the newspaper. This is a violation of policy. Newspapers should publicize the various policies of the Party and the People's Government and educate cadres and the masses in various places to conscientiously implement the policies, but the Jiangxi Daily does not conduct publicity based on the policies. I suggest that the Jiangxi Daily not only make a profound self-criticism but also earnestly study policies in the future and correctly publicize policies. Zhang Sunhuan

    不应提倡老弱运送公粮
    编辑同志：十月三十一日江西日报刊登了一篇“临川县太保乡组织集体送粮”的消息。消息中说：“临川县一区太保乡组织了六百三十五人的送粮大队，有三十几个七十多岁的老农民和十四、五岁的儿童都参加了……。”中央人民政府财政部制发的“农业税征收业务暂行通则”第九条中有如下的规定：“……严禁老弱残废、疾病、怀孕的人和不合条件的牲畜参加运输，……。”其目的是为避免发生伤亡事故。江西日报没有根据政府的政策，指出让七十多岁的老农民和十四、五岁的儿童参加送粮的错误，反而在报纸上提倡老弱运送公粮的事实，这是违反政策的。报纸应该宣传党与人民政府的各种政策，并教育各地干部、群众认真执行政策，而江西日报却不根据政策进行宣传。我建议江西日报除作深刻检讨外，并在今后一定要认真地学习政策，正确地宣传政策。张孙桓
