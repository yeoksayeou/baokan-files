    The Central Private Enterprise Bureau was originally an agency under the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government responsible for managing private enterprises. Recently, due to work needs, it was decided that the Metrology Department and Invention Examination Department of the Central Technical Administration of the former Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Mining Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, and the Provincial and Municipal Private Enterprise Group of the Ministry of Fuel Industry would all be placed under the Bureau's leadership. Thus, the Bureau's tasks are no longer limited to the management of private enterprises. Therefore, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has approved renaming the Bureau the Central Administration of Industry and Commerce. All industrial and commercial bureaus above the level of province-administered cities, as well as provincial industrial and commercial departments, in addition to being led by the local people's government, will also be guided by the Bureau in related industrial and commercial administrative work.

    中央私营企业局
    改为中央工商行政管理局
    中央私营企业局原为中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会管理私营企业的机构，最近由于工作上的需要，经决定前中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会中央技术管理局之度量衡处及发明审定处，中央人民政府重工业部之矿业处、燃料工业部之省市私营企业组都划归该局领导。这样该局的工作任务已不限于私营企业之管理，因此中央人民政府政务院批准了将该局名称改为中央工商行政管理局，凡是省辖市以上工商局及省工业厅、商业厅，除受当地人民政府领导外，有关工商行政工作，并受该局指导。
