Cadres of organs in provinces and cities of the Central South Region began studying documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" in early and mid-November. According to current incomplete statistics, of the more than 34,600 cadres participating in the study throughout the region, 1,836 were high-ranking cadres, including: 411 from organs directly under the Central South Bureau; 265 from the South China Sub-bureau (including Guangdong Province); 163 from Wuhan City; 132 from Guangzhou City; 131 from Hubei Province; 155 from Henan Province; 120 from Hunan Province; 179 from Jiangxi Province; 186 from Guangxi Province; 27 from Hengyang Railway Administration; and 67 from Zhengzhou Railway Administration.

Party committees at all levels attached great importance to the theoretical study of high-ranking cadres. Li Xuefeng, Second Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau, and Zhao Yimin, Director of the Propaganda Department, personally led the study. Li Xuefeng also personally gave a mobilization report to cadres from various units directly under the Central South Bureau participating in the high-ranking study group. Tao Zhu, Fourth Secretary of the South China Sub-bureau, Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary and Director of the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, Zhu Guang, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou Municipality, Cheng Tan, Second Deputy Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Zhang Tixue, Third Deputy Secretary, Zhou Xiaozhou, Deputy Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Secretary-General Yang Difu, Chen Manyuan, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and Liu Shenzhi, Director of the Political Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau Party Committee, also made study mobilization reports to the high-ranking study groups of directly subordinate organs and railway systems in their respective provinces and cities in mid-November, and made specific arrangements for the study. This played a significant role in strengthening the high-ranking cadres' understanding of the importance of studying Stalin's " Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Part of the Soviet Union, and in promoting the theoretical study of the high-ranking groups.

In order to specifically lead and promote the study of the high-ranking groups, leading study organizations were established in various places. High-ranking group study committees were established in the organs directly under the Central South Bureau, the South China Sub-bureau, Hubei Province, Jiangxi Province, Guangxi Province, Hunan Province, and Guangzhou City. Zhao Yimin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau, serves as the Chairman of the High-Ranking Group Study Committee of the Central South Bureau organs, and fifty study groups have been established. The chairmen and vice-chairmen of the study committees of various provinces and cities are respectively the secretaries and heads of propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal party committees, who directly lead and control the theoretical study of the high-ranking groups. In order to further strengthen the leadership of the study, the organs directly under the Central South Bureau, the South China Sub-bureau, Guangxi Province, Henan Province, Hubei Province, and other places have also established central study groups for high-ranking groups, led by the secretaries of the party committees or the heads of propaganda departments, and participated by the main responsible comrades or study group leaders of various departments, to study one step ahead of the general high-ranking cadres and discuss and solve difficult problems in the central group, so as to better lead the study of the general high-ranking cadres. In addition, most of the general high-ranking cadres have been organized into study groups, and the group leaders are mostly responsible comrades.

In order to effectively maintain the study, some organs and units in various places have formulated study systems and disciplines. For example, during the specified study time, no office work, no phone calls, no visitors; for collective study, a sign-in system is implemented, and no one should be late or leave early. Some also stipulate taking notes, writing心得 (personal reflections), and holding periodic informal talks or discussion meetings. In order to ensure that study time is effectively guaranteed, units such as the organs directly under the Central South Bureau, the South China Sub-bureau, Guangxi Province, Guangzhou City, and the Zhengzhou Railway Administration have also designated fixed study times or established a "study day" system, stopping office work and concentrating on study at a unified time.

In this learning process, responsible comrades of party and government at all levels can generally take the lead actively, abide by the learning system, and study seriously. In particular, since the publication of the People's Daily editorial: "We must attach importance to the theoretical study of senior cadres," senior cadres in various places have launched studies with unprecedented enthusiasm. For example, Li Xiannian, Third Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau, persevered in self-study by finding gaps in his busy work.

The first study group (central group) of the Central South Bureau, composed of Li Xuefeng, Second Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau, Zhao Yimin, Director of the Propaganda Department, and the main responsible comrades of various ministries and commissions, is seriously studying Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR". They carefully studied the documents, consulted some necessary reference books, and raised some questions for discussion. At the two study and discussion meetings, heated discussions were held on basic issues of the current international situation and the basic economic laws of socialism and modern capitalism. They have now decided to hold a study meeting once a week.

The progress of this study is generally healthy and enthusiastic. The study groups that have been organized have generally held one to two study and discussion meetings, and some have held as many as four or five. For example, the Central South Land Reform Committee study group has discussed the current international situation four times; in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, the city-wide high-ranking cadre study and discussion meeting personally controlled by the Municipal Party Secretary Yang Diankui has been held five times; Wuhan City recently held two consecutive discussion meetings, personally presided over by Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary and Director of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the first of which was attended by more than 40 people, and launched a heated discussion on issues such as the current international situation.

The development of high-ranking group study is only the beginning. The study of some regions and organs still has shortcomings such as looseness, spontaneity, and lack of organization and leadership. For example, mistakenly believing that "self-study is the main thing" means no organization and leadership, and as a result, the phenomenon of perfunctory study has occurred in individual units. The Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration completed the study of Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Comrade Malenkov's report in only one month, obviously such study is not profound. In view of these circumstances, the most urgent problem to be solved in the current study of high-ranking groups is to strengthen the leadership of the study and persevere in the study. To this end, the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau convened a joint meeting of the heads of the propaganda departments of the various sub-party committees directly under the Central South Bureau and the leaders of the high-ranking group study groups on December 5 to discuss the issue of further strengthening organizational leadership. On December 15, the General Office of the Central South Bureau issued a notice, making specific provisions for strengthening the organizational leadership of high-ranking group study and unifying study time, and notified the party committees of directly subordinate organs of various provinces and cities, the party committees of Zhengzhou and Hengyang Railway Bureaus, and the party committees of various industrial and mining enterprises to follow suit for the high-ranking groups.

In view of the current study situation of high-ranking cadres in the Central South Region, the Changjiang Daily published a short commentary on December 24, emphasizing that in order to make the study movement not only start but also persist, "a series of meticulous and specific organizational work must be carried out with enthusiasm, patience, and constant diligence. Therefore, party committees at all levels and administrative leaders of all organs and units must personally and practically grasp this theoretical study of senior cadres."

    中南区各省市机关高级干部带头学习斯大林著作及联共代表大会文件
    中南区各省、市机关干部，先后于十一月上、中旬开始学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件及斯大林同志著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。据目前不完全统计：全区参加学习的三万四千六百余干部中，高级干部就有一千八百三十六人：计中南直属机关四百一十一人；华南分局（包括广东省在内）二百六十五人；武汉市一百六十三人；广州市一百三十二人；湖北省一百三十一人；河南省一百五十五人；湖南省一百二十人；江西省一百七十九人；广西省一百八十六人；衡阳铁路管理局二十七人；郑州铁路管理局六十七人。
    各级党委对高级组干部的理论学习极其重视。中南局第二副书记李雪峰同志、宣传部部长赵毅敏同志均亲自领导学习。李雪峰同志并亲自向中南直属机关各单位参加高级组学习的干部作了学习动员报告；华南分局第四书记陶铸同志、武汉市委第一副书记兼宣传部长李尔重同志、广州市人民政府副市长朱光同志、湖北省委第二副书记程坦同志、第三副书记张体学同志、湖南省委副书记周小舟同志和秘书长杨第甫同志、广西省委书记陈漫远同志、河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃同志、衡阳铁路局党委政治部主任刘慎之同志等也都分别于十一月中旬向各该省、市直属机关及铁路系统理论学习高级组干部作了学习动员报告，并作了学习的具体布置。这对于加强高级组干部对学习斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件重要性的认识，和推动高级组的理论学习，起了很大作用。
    为具体领导和推动高级组的学习，各地都先后建立了学习的领导机构。中南直属机关、华南分局、湖北省、江西省、广西省、湖南省、广州市等地均成立了理论学习高级组学习委员会。中南直属机关理论学习高级组学习委员会主任委员，由中南局宣传部部长赵毅敏同志担任，并已建立了五十个学习小组。各省、市学习委员会正副主任委员分别由各省市党委书记、宣传部部长等担任，直接领导与掌握高级组的理论学习。为进一步加强学习的领导，中南直属机关、华南分局、广西省、河南省、湖北省等地又成立了高级组学习中心小组，由党委书记或宣传部部长任组长，由各部门主要负责同志或学习组长参加，比一般高级干部先学一步，将疑难问题在中心小组讨论解决，以便更好地领导一般高级干部学习。此外一般高级干部大部分已组织起来，编成学习小组，组长多由较负责的同志担任。
    为有效地坚持学习，各地有的机关单位订出了学习制度与纪律。如规定的学习时间内，不办公、不打电话、不会客；集体学习的，则实行签到制，不迟到不早退。有的并规定记笔记、写心得、定期召开漫谈会或讨论会。为使学习时间得到切实保证，中南直属机关、华南分局、广西省、广州市、郑州铁路管理局等地单位并划定了固定学习时间或建立了“学习日”制，在统一的时间内停止办公集中学习。
    在这一学习过程中，各级党政负责同志一般都能积极带头，遵守学习制度，认真学习，特别是自人民日报社论：“必须重视高级干部的理论学习”发表后，各地高级干部均以前所未有的热情展开了学习。如中南局第三副书记李先念同志在百忙的工作中找空隙坚持了自学。
    由中南局第二副书记李雪峰同志、宣传部部长赵毅敏同志以及各部委主要负责同志组成的中南局第一学习小组（中心小组），正在认真钻研斯大林同志著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。他们精读了文件、参阅了一些必要的参考书，并提出了一些问题进行讨论。在两次学习讨论会上，对目前国际形势的基本问题以及社会主义与现代资本主义的基本经济法则等问题展开了热烈的讨论。他们现在确定每周开一次学习会。
    这次学习的进行一般是健康而热烈的。目前已组织起来的学习小组，普遍开了一次至两次学习讨论会，有的多至四、五次。如中南土地改革委员会学习小组已就目前国际形势问题讨论过四次；湖北省黄石市由市委书记杨殿魁同志亲自掌握的全市高级组干部学习讨论会已开过五次；武汉市最近两周连续召开两次讨论会，由市委第一副书记兼宣传部长李尔重同志亲自主持，第一次出席四十余人，对目前国际形势等问题展开了热烈的讨论。
    目前高级组学习的开展，还仅仅是开始。某些地区和机关单位的学习，还存在着涣散、自流、缺乏组织和领导的缺点。如误认为“自学为主”就是不要组织和领导，因之，在个别单位发生了学习草率的现象。郑州铁路管理局所属西安分局只以一个月的时间便学完了斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”及马林科夫同志所作报告，显然这样学习是不会深刻的。根据这些情况，目前高级组学习中亟待解决的问题就是加强学习领导，将学习坚持下去。为此，中南局宣传部特于十二月五日召开了中南直属机关各分党委宣传部部长及高级组学习小组长联席会议，讨论了进一步加强组织领导问题。十二月十五日，中南局办公厅发出通知，对于加强高级组学习组织领导、统一学习时间等问题作了具体规定，并通知各省、市直属机关党委及郑州、衡阳铁路局党委及各工矿党委高级组仿行。
    针对目前中南区高级干部的学习情况，十二月二十四日长江日报曾发表短评，强调指出：为了使学习运动不仅开展起来而且要坚持下去，“必须热情、耐心地、经常不倦地作一系列细致具体的组织工作。因此，各级党委和各机关单位的行政首长，必须把这次高级干部的理论学习亲自切实地抓起来。”
