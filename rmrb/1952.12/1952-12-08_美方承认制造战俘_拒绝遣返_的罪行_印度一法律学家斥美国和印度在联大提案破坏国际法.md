    US Admits to the Crime of Manufacturing POWs Who "Refuse Repatriation"
    Indian Legal Scholar Criticizes US and Indian Proposal at the UN for Undermining International Law
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 6th] US Secretary of Defense Lovett admitted that the so-called POWs who "refuse repatriation" were manufactured by the US side.
    According to a report by the United Press, Lovett admitted at a press conference on the 2nd, when talking about the so-called "refusal to repatriate" POWs in US POW camps, that many POWs were "betrayed by the persuasion of the Allied propaganda personnel." Therefore, if they were "forced to be repatriated," it would lose "credibility." Lovett's confession exposed all the lies the American aggressors had fabricated in the past on the POW issue. Until recently, the US government was still deceiving the world at the United Nations General Assembly, saying that the reason it opposed "forced repatriation" of POWs was due to so-called "humanitarian considerations" and to respect the "personal will" of the POWs. According to Acheson, these POWs who "refused repatriation" were said to "believe" that they would be "killed, imprisoned, or cruelly treated in some way" after being repatriated, so they would resist repatriation by force.
    Now, Lovett has let the world know how these POWs came to "believe" such absurd lies; it turned out to be the result of "persuasion" by "Allied propaganda personnel"! Lovett did not dare to explain what kind of people these "Allied propaganda personnel" were; nor did he dare to explain according to which article of the Geneva Convention, which the US government repeatedly said it would abide by, he sent these people to POW camps to conduct "propaganda." But without Lovett's admission, the world has long known that these so-called "propaganda personnel" are US agents and agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs. These agents organized "anti-communist corps" in the POW camps and used various abuses and persecutions to force POWs not to go home. Only shameless American aggressors and those whose consciences have been blinded by dirty dollars can say that this "refusal to repatriate" manufactured by agents with torture is the "free will" of the POWs.
    Although Lovett avoided talking about how these "propaganda personnel" conducted "persuasion," he finally talked about one method of "persuasion." This method is to force tattoos on the bodies of POWs. Lovett said at a press conference: "The purpose of tattooing anti-communist slogans on the bodies of POWs is obviously to indicate that the POWs will be killed if they are forcibly repatriated." He said: "Anti-communists obviously believe that tattooing on their bodies is another guarantee that they will not be repatriated." Lovett used the tone of an American agent here. His words are exactly the same as those reported by the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were forced by the US to act as airborne agents. These people once reported to the Korean and Chinese sides that US agents forced anti-communist slogans on the bodies of POWs and then threatened the POWs that if they went back, they would be killed. Lovett's words actually mean that after the POWs are tattooed, there is a "guarantee" to detain them. But the hopes of Lovett and other American agents have fallen through. Even if the POWs were forced to be tattooed on their bodies, they still firmly demanded repatriation. The countless incidents of massacre of POWs in US POW camps fully illustrate this. What Lovett fears is obviously not that the repatriation of these POWs will lose "credibility," but that after these POWs are repatriated, they will fully expose and accuse the American murderers to the world for the shocking crimes that have not yet been revealed. The evil fact that American aggressors use bayonets to create "POWs who refuse repatriation" is actually something the whole world has long known. But just as diplomats in the United Nations, under the command of the dollar, are singing in chorus with the US representatives the shameless rhetoric of "not forcibly repatriating POWs," Lovett, as the US Secretary of Defense, once again admitted this fact, which is tantamount to giving American aggressors and these servile diplomats a resounding slap in the face.
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 6th] According to TASS Delhi on the 5th: "National Herald" published an article titled "Korean POWs and International Law" written by an anonymous legal scholar, commenting on the proposals made by the United States and India at the United Nations regarding the Korean issue. The article said: "I have come to the conclusion that the current US government does not want an armistice in Korea, and their ultimate goal seems to be to turn the Korean War into a full-scale war. Indian public opinion should clearly understand what is involved in the stalemate on the issue of repatriating Korean POWs. I would like to express my opinion as a legal scholar and an ordinary citizen. My view is that from the perspective of international law, the Chinese government is correct."
    The Indian legal scholar went on to write: The US principle of non-forcible repatriation is being put forward for the first time in the history of international relations. The United States has never accepted this principle when it involves its own soldiers, and neither has Britain, France, India, or any other country. The principle of not forcibly repatriating POWs is a harmful principle. It will create chaos in wartime. The US government is talking about humanitarian considerations, which is nonsense. Countries around the world have accepted the Geneva Convention, according to which all POWs must be sent to the country to which they belong after the war.
    The article concluded: "The truth is that the US principle of non-forcible repatriation will completely undermine existing international law. The US government itself does not believe in this principle, and they are proposing this principle knowing full well that China will not accept it. The Chinese government refused the Indian plan because the plan basically accepted the US principle of not forcibly repatriating soldiers who have become prisoners. I don't see how China can be blamed for making such a decision. If thousands of Indian POWs were detained by Pakistan, the Indian government would take the same attitude."

### 美方承认制造战俘“拒绝遣返”的罪行  印度一法律学家斥美国和印度在联大提案破坏国际法

    美方承认制造战俘“拒绝遣返”的罪行
    印度一法律学家斥美国和印度在联大提案破坏国际法
    【新华社六日讯】美国国防部长罗维特承认所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘是美方制造出来的。
    据合众社报道，罗维特二日在记者招待会上谈到美方战俘营中的所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘时承认，很多战俘是“由联军宣传人员劝导而背叛的”，因此，如果“强迫把他们遣返”，便会失掉“信用”。罗维特的自白拆穿了美国侵略者过去在战俘问题上捏造的全部鬼话。美国政府直到最近都还在联合国大会上欺骗全世界说，它之所以要反对“强迫遣返”战俘，是由于所谓“人道的考虑”，是为了尊重战俘的“个人意志”。据艾奇逊说，这些“拒绝遣返”的战俘据说是由于“相信”他们被遣返以后将被“杀害、囚禁或被以某些方法残酷地对待”，因此他们要以武力抗拒遣返。
    现在，罗维特让全世界知道了这些战俘怎么会“相信”这种荒谬的鬼话的，原来这是“联军宣传人员”对他们“劝导”的结果！罗维特没有敢说明，这些“联军宣传人员”是些什么样的人；他也没有敢说明，他是根据美国政府口口声声说要遵守的日内瓦公约的那一条派这些人去战俘营里进行“宣传”的。但是用不着罗维特承认，全世界早已知道了这些所谓“宣传人员”就是美国的和蒋介石、李承晚匪帮的特务分子。这些特务分子在战俘营里组织了“反共团”，用各种虐待和迫害来强迫战俘不回家。只有寡廉鲜耻的美国侵略者和那些让肮脏的美元蒙蔽了良心的人，才能说这种由特务分子用刑具制造出来的“拒绝遣返”是战俘的“自由意志”。
    虽然罗维特避而不谈这些“宣传人员”是怎样进行“劝导”的，但是他终于谈出了一种“劝导”的方法。这个方法就是强迫在战俘身上刺字。罗维特在记者招待会上说：“战俘身上刺反共标语的目的，显然是要标明战俘如果被用武力遣返，将被杀害。”他说：“反共产主义者显然相信，在身上刺字是他们不被遣返的另一个保证。”罗维特在这里用的俨然就是一个美国特务的口气。他的话和那些被美方强迫充当空降特务的中国人民志愿军被俘人员所报告的是完全一样的。这些人曾经向朝中方面报告说，美方特务在战俘身上强迫刺了反共的标语以后，就恐吓战俘说，如果他们回去，就要被杀害。罗维特的话实际上就是说：在战俘身上刺了字以后，扣留他们就有了“保证”。但是罗维特之流的美国特务们的希望落空了。战俘们纵然在身上被强迫刺了字，却仍然坚决要求遣返。在美方战俘营中发生的无数次屠杀战俘的事件就完全说明了这一点。罗维特所害怕的，显然不是遣返了这些战俘就会丧失“信用”，而是害怕这些战俘在被遣返以后，就会向全世界尽情揭发和控诉美国杀人犯至今还没有透露出来的骇人听闻的罪行。美国侵略者用刺刀制造“拒绝遣返的战俘”的罪恶事实，其实是全世界早就知道了的。但是正当联合国中的外交家们在美元的指挥下和美国代表合唱“不强迫遣返战俘”的无耻谰调的时候，身为美国国防部长的罗维特又一次承认了这个事实，这就无异给美国侵略者自己和这些奴颜婢膝的外交家们吃了一记响亮的耳光。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社德里五日讯：“国民先驱报”发表了一位未署名的法律学家所写的题为“朝鲜战俘与国际法”的文章，评论美国和印度在联合国提出的关于朝鲜问题的建议。文章说：“我得出这样的结论：目前的美国政府不想在朝鲜停战，他们的最后目的似乎是要把朝鲜战争变成全面战争。印度舆论应当清楚了解关于遣返朝鲜战俘问题的僵局牵涉到一些什么问题。我愿以一个法律学家和一个普通公民的资格发表我的意见。我的看法是，从国际法方面来说，中国政府是正确的。”
    这位印度法律学家接着写道：美国的不强迫遣返原则在国际关系史上还是第一次提出来。美国在涉及它自己的士兵时，从未接受过这种原则，英国、法国、印度或任何其他国家也是这样。不强迫遣返战俘的原则是一个有害的原则。它会在战时造成混乱。美国政府正谈论人道的考虑，这种谈论是胡说。世界各国接受了日内瓦公约，根据这个公约，全部战俘必须在战后送交他们所属的国家。
    文章最后说：“真相是，美国的不强迫遣返原则将完全破坏现有的国际法。美国政府自己也不相信这个原则，他们是明知中国不会接受这个原则而提出这个原则来的。中国政府之所以拒绝印度的方案，是因为这个方案基本上接受了美国的不强迫遣返已成为俘虏的士兵的原则。我看不出怎么能怪中国作出了这样的决定。如果成千上万的印度战俘为巴基斯坦所拘留的话，印度政府也将采取同样的态度。”
