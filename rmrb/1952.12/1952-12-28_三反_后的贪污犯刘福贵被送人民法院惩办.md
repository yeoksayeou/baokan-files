    Corrupt Official Liu Fugui, After the "Three-Anti" Campaign, Sent to People's Court for Punishment
    To the Editor: Liu Fugui, a cadre of the Muleng Forestry Bureau of the Mudanjiang Forestry Administration Bureau in Songjiang Province, embezzled more than 27 times before the "Three-Anti" movement, totaling more than 3 million RMB.

    During the "Three-Anti" movement, Liu Fugui refused to honestly confess and played tricks. After repeated persuasion from responsible comrades and many other comrades, he confessed his problems and received lenient treatment. After the "Three-Anti" movement, Liu Fugui was assigned to work as an administrator in a workshop of the Bamian Tong Operation Area of the Muleng Forestry Bureau. Not long ago, when the preparations for repairing the workers' dormitories in the workshop began, Liu Fugui actually colluded with the foreman who contracted the repair of the dormitories, indulging in lavish eating and drinking, and secretly colluded with other illegal foremen such as Zhang Zhonghai. After the dormitories were completed, more than 20 rooms were already crooked before anyone even moved in. When he inspected the quality of the project himself, he also found that the dormitories were crooked, but he did not allow the workers to rework them, only telling them to tamp them down with shovels and plaster them with mud to get it over with, which at least shortened the lifespan of the dormitories. During the construction of the dormitories, he had more than 50 workers who were building the dormitories build houses for himself. He also embezzled public timber, wire, etc. In addition, he embezzled 1.8 million RMB during the dormitory construction. After the director of the Bamian Tong Operation Area discovered these circumstances, he had a private conversation with Liu, but Liu tried every means to deny it. Under the workers' exposure, Liu could not deny it. On December 2, the Muleng Forestry Bureau held a general assembly of all employees to publicly try the recidivist embezzler Liu Fugui. At the public trial, Liu confessed to his crimes of embezzlement one by one. At the request of all employees, Liu was immediately escorted to the People's Court for punishment according to the law.

    “三反”后的贪污犯刘福贵被送人民法院惩办
    编辑同志：松江省牡丹江市森林工业管理局穆棱作业分局干部刘福贵，在“三反”运动以前，曾经贪污过二十七次以上，计贪污人民币三百多万元。
    “三反”运动中，刘福贵不肯老实坦白，耍花招。经负责同志和许多同志的再三说服，他才把问题交代出来，并得到宽大处理。“三反”运动后，刘福贵被分配到穆棱作业分局八面通作业所的某工场做管理员。不久以前，当该工场修工舍的准备工作开始时，刘福贵竟又和包修工舍的工头混在一起，大吃大喝，并和其他不法工头张忠海等私自拉拢。工舍完工后，还没有住上人，就有二十多间歪了。他自己检查工程质量时，也发现工舍歪了，但他不让工人返工，只叫工人用铁锹捣一捣，用泥糊上就了事，这起码也缩短了工舍的寿命。在这次工舍工程进行中，他曾让正在建筑工舍的五十多名工人为他自己造房子。他并且挪用公家的木料、铁丝等。另外，在工舍施工中，他还贪污了一百八十万元。八面通作业所所长发觉这些情况后，曾经和刘犯个别谈话，但刘犯想尽各种办法抵赖。在工人们的检举下，刘犯无法抵赖了。十二月二日，穆棱作业分局召开公审这个一犯再犯的贪污分子刘福贵的全体职工大会。公审大会上，刘犯一一招认了贪污罪行。在全体职工的要求下，当场将刘犯押送人民法院依法惩办。
