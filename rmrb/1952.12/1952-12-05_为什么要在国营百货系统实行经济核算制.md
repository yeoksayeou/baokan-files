Why Implement Economic Accounting in the State-Owned Department Store System
Li Ruxiu, Deputy Manager of China Department Store Corporation

Over the past three years, under the leadership and assistance of Party committees and People's Governments at all levels, the state-owned department stores have established institutions and developed businesses along with the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, which has played a significant role in stabilizing prices, supporting light industrial production, and supplying the people's living needs. These achievements should be affirmed. However, there are still some serious shortcomings and errors in our work, which must be overcome immediately.

First, the turnover rate of capital is getting slower and slower. The continuous improvement of people's purchasing power and the development of state-owned department store business have led to a year-by-year increase in the capital of state-owned department store enterprises. However, the turnover rate has been getting slower and slower during the continuous increase of capital. In 1951, the capital turnover period was 202 days, and it is estimated that the turnover rate for the whole year of 1952 will be one-sixth slower than that of 1951. The loss caused by the slow capital turnover, just in terms of interest alone, amounts to about 100,000 tons of millet.

Second, commodity circulation costs are increasing year by year. The situation of the year-by-year increase of commodity circulation costs in the state-owned department store system is extremely alarming. The total company's interest payment alone increased by 2.05% in the first nine months of 1952 compared to the entire year of 1951. In the East China state-owned department store system, the proportion of circulation costs to sales revenue increased by an average of 30% in the first half of 1952 compared to 1951; in the Northwest state-owned department store system, the expense ratio in the first half of 1952 increased by 3.29% compared to 1951. This not only increased the difficulty in business operations, but more importantly, increased commodity costs, affecting national accumulation.

Third, blind allocation and inaccurate supply. The phenomenon of state-owned department stores in various regions blindly allocating goods without regard to seasons and consumption habits is very serious. The backlog and stock-out caused by the general company's blind and rigid allocation of goods is even more serious. Refined sugar, which sold well in the former Pingyuan Province, could not be sold in the Northwest at all, but the general company transferred 210 tons of refined sugar from the former Pingyuan Province to the Northwest Region in February 1951. Later, because the Northwest could not promote sales, and the former Pingyuan Province was very short of goods, this batch of refined sugar was transferred back from the Northwest. Such back and forth resulted in a loss of 411.134 million yuan in interest, warehouse rent, and freight alone, not including the loss of goods. In addition, the situation that Tangshan City Company received summer goods such as sleeping mats and straw sandals only after the autumn of 1951 has also occurred continuously in other places. The result of such a disconnect between supply and demand and blind allocation not only caused the accumulation and waste of huge amounts of state funds, but also directly affected the timely supply of daily necessities to the broad masses of people.

Fourth, in the implementation of price policies, the phenomenon of arbitrarily reducing the wholesale and retail price difference and regional price difference still seriously exists in the department store system. In Shashi, there was a phenomenon that the retail price of towels was 4.6% lower than the wholesale price. The phenomenon of various places reducing the wholesale quantity limit and expanding retail sales in disguised forms has also continued to occur. These have greatly aggravated the confusion in business management and affected the promotion and accurate supply of goods.

These shortcomings and errors seriously hinder the further development of department store business and weaken the leading role of the state-owned economy in various economic components. One of the reasons why these shortcomings and errors can occur and develop is that the institutions and systems have unreasonable aspects. For example, commodities are not circulated according to natural economic regions, but are allocated layer by layer according to administrative divisions, causing the phenomenon of round-trip transportation of materials. The institutions are large and scattered, making it difficult to strengthen leadership. Another reason is that our leading cadres at all levels do not have enough understanding of the importance of planning work, do not study production and sales conditions, do not investigate the changes in people's purchasing power, make subjective assumptions, blindly purchase goods, and allocate them casually. They do not realize that the main task of department store enterprises is to meet the needs of the broad masses of people for industrial products. Therefore, the formulation of plans must be based on the people's consumption situation, and any plan or allocation that deviates from the actual needs of the people is wrong.

The fundamental reason why these serious shortcomings and errors have continued for a long time and cannot be discovered and corrected in time is the growing and developing supply system ideology in the department store system. Everyone has long been content with the practices of "only doing business, not calculating detailed accounts," "only paying attention to completing the cash recovery task, not attaching importance to the implementation of policies," and "allocating from above and selling below, asking for money when there is no money, and asking for goods when there is a shortage." The economic losses brought to us by this supply system ideology are huge, and the political losses caused by it are even more incalculable.

In order to effectively overcome these shortcomings and errors, strengthen the operational enthusiasm of state-owned department store enterprise cadres, improve commodity circulation, and better serve consumers and production, we must resolutely implement the decision of the Central Ministry of Commerce, change the commodity circulation organization in the state-owned department store system, establish wholesale stations, and implement the economic accounting system. This is a comprehensive reform of the state-owned department store system from institutions to systems, and it is the key to our future improvement of business. Therefore, we require leading cadres at all levels of the state-owned department store system to earnestly promote democracy, rely on all employees, thoroughly expose shortcomings in work, criticize the supply system ideology, and launch a rationalization proposal campaign to strive for the establishment of wholesale stations and gradually implement the economic accounting system.

    为什么要在国营百货系统实行经济核算制
    中国百货公司副经理　李汝修
    三年来，国营百货公司在各级党委与人民政府的领导和帮助下，随着国家经济的迅速恢复和发展，建立了机构，发展了业务，这对平稳物价、扶植轻工业生产、供应人民生活需要，都起了巨大的作用。这些成绩是应该肯定的。但在我们的工作中，还存在着一些严重的缺点及错误，这是要立即加以克服的。
    一、资金的周转速度愈来愈慢了。人民购买力的不断提高和国营百货业务的发展，使国营百货企业的资金逐年增大。但在资金不断增加的过程中，它的周转速度是愈来愈慢了。一九五一年资金周转期为二○二天，估计一九五二年全年的周转率比一九五一年要慢六分之一。因资金周转缓慢所造成的损失，仅利息一项，即达十万吨小米左右。
    二、商品流转费用逐年增大。国营百货系统商品流转费用逐年增大的情况，是异常惊人的。总公司单是支付利息一项，一九五二年的九个月就比一九五一年全年增大了百分之二点○五。华东国营百货系统的流转费所占卖钱额的比例，一九五二年上半年平均数比一九五一年增加了百分之三十；西北国营百货系统一九五二年上半年的费用率比一九五一年增大了百分之三点二九，这样不仅增加了业务经营中的困难，更重要的是增大了商品成本，影响了国家积累。
    三、盲目调拨、供应不准确。各地国营百货公司不按照季节和消费习惯而盲目调拨商品的现象是很严重的。由于总公司盲目地和硬性地调拨商品所造成的积压与脱销现象，更为严重。畅销于前平原省的生糖，根本不能在西北销售，但总公司却于一九五一年二月，由前平原省调往西北区生糖二一○吨。后来由于西北不能推销，而前平原省十分缺货，又把这批生糖由西北调回。这样来回周折，仅利息、栈租、运费，就损失了四亿一千一百三十四万元，损耗尚未计算在内。此外，像唐山市公司在一九五一年秋后才收到凉席、草鞋等夏令货的情况，在其他各地也不断发生。这样供求脱节和盲目调拨的结果，不仅积压和浪费了国家巨额资金，而且直接影响了对广大人民生活必需品的及时供应。
    四、在执行价格政策中，任意缩小批发和零售差价与地区差价的现象，在百货系统中还严重地存在着。沙市曾经发生过毛巾的零售价低于批发价百分之四点六的现象。各地降低批发限量起点，变相扩大零售的现象，也曾不断发生。这些都大大地加重了经营管理中的混乱，影响了商品的推销和准确供应。
    这些缺点和错误严重地阻碍了百货业务进一步的发展，削弱了国营经济对各种经济成分的领导作用。这些缺点和错误之所以能够发生和发展，其原因之一是机构和制度有不合理处。例如，商品不按自然经济区域流转而按行政区划层层调拨，造成物资往返运输的现象。机构庞大分散，不易加强领导。另一个原因是我们各级领导干部对计划工作的重要性认识不足，不研究产销情况，不调查人民购买力的变化情形，主观臆断，盲目进货，随便调拨，没有认识到百货企业的主要任务在于满足广大人民对工业品的需要，因此，制订计划必须以人民消费情况为依据，任何脱离人民实际需要的计划或调拨都是错误的。
    这些严重的缺点和错误之所以长期延续，不能及时发现和改正的根本原因，是在百货系统中日益滋长和发展着的供给制思想。大家长期安于“只做买卖，不算细账”，“只注意完成回笼任务，不重视执行政策”和“上拨下卖，没钱要钱，脱销要货”的作法。这种供给制思想带给我们经济上的损失是巨大的，而由此造成的政治损失更是难以计算的。
    为了有效地克服这些缺点和错误，加强国营百货企业干部的经营积极性，改善商品流转状况，更好地为消费者和为生产服务，我们必须坚决执行中央商业部的决定，在国营百货系统中改变商品流转组织，建立批发站，实施经济核算制。这是国营百货系统从机构到制度的全面改革，是我们今后改进业务的关键。因此，我们要求国营百货系统的各级领导干部，认真发扬民主，依靠全体职工，彻底揭发工作中的缺点，批判供给制思想，开展合理化建议运动，为建立批发站，逐步实施经济核算制而奋斗。
