Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Indian progressive public opinion vehemently condemns the American aggressors' crime of massacring prisoners of war on Geoje Island and expresses condemnation of the Indian proposal passed by the United Nations General Assembly.

The "Freedom Daily" published an editorial on the 24th entitled "We Demand Punishment of the Butchers Who Slaughtered Prisoners of War," stating: "American butchers can sit in the United Nations and, relying on the votes of their servants, shirk responsibility for the massacre, but they cannot escape world public opinion. The inhumane massacre in the Korean prisoner-of-war camps, the use of cruel and barbaric means against hundreds of people, these crimes can no longer be covered up today. The Soviet representative exposed the masks of these demons."

The editorial pointed out: "Today it is very clear that the United Nations resolution on Korea, formulated for the benefit of the American butchers, cleared the way for the butchers to massacre prisoners of war on Geoje Island. The Indian people unanimously oppose the American proposal in the name of India, which is being used to continue the massacres. Every peace-loving and freedom-loving Indian resolutely protests the massacre of prisoners of war in Korea and demands the immediate punishment of the butchers."

The Urdu daily "New Century," published in Julongdu City, Punjab Province, published an editorial on the 25th stating: "India's proposal on the Korean issue adopts a principle of 'voluntary' exchange of prisoners of war that violates the Geneva Convention. In fact, this proposal encourages the warmongers to intensify their bloody massacres of prisoners of war."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: The "Freedom Daily" published in Calcutta on the 19th published an editorial commenting on the proposal on resolving the Korean issue put forward by Dr. Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation to the World Peace Congress. The title of the editorial was "The Indian Proposal in Vienna." The editorial stated: "Dr. Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation, proposed an immediate end to the Korean War at the World Peace Congress. The representatives who came to Vienna to participate in this conference came from areas with two systems. Moreover, some of them fervently believe in their own economic and social systems. At such an international conference, it is of particular significance that Dr. Kitchlew, a veteran of the Indian ruling party—the Congress Party—and head of the Indian delegation, put forward a proposal to stop the Korean War. If we look at the recent world situation, then its great significance is very clear.

At the United Nations, India's proposal on the Korean issue has been adopted by a majority of the United Nations, but the Korean War has not stopped. But India's representative in Vienna has unconditionally demanded an 'immediate end to the war'.

The strength of the Indian people supporting the resolutions of the World Peace Congress in Vienna must be quickly organized. It must become an irresistible force for maintaining peace. This force has emerged from Vienna. Now the Indian people must raise this banner and move forward."

    印“自由报”等评蜂岩岛事件要求惩罚美国刽子手
    【新华社新德里电】印度进步舆论痛斥美国侵略者在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘的罪行，并对联合国大会通过的印度提案表示谴责。
    “自由报”二十四日以“我们要求惩罚屠杀战俘的刽子手”为题，发表社论说：“美国刽子手们可以坐在联合国内，依靠着仆从们的投票来推脱屠杀的责任，但是他们逃不过世界舆论。在朝鲜战俘营内进行惨无人道的屠杀，对成百的人使用残酷野蛮的手段，这些罪行在今天是再也掩盖不住了。苏联代表揭穿了这些魔鬼们的假面具。”
    社论指出：“今天事情很明显，为了美国刽子手的利益而制订的联合国关于朝鲜的决议案，为刽子手们在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘扫清了道路。印度人民一致反对以印度为名的美国提案，这个提案被利用来继续进行屠杀。每个爱好和平自由的印度人都坚决抗议在朝鲜屠杀战俘，要求立即惩罚刽子手。”
    在旁遮普省朱龙多城发行的乌尔都文日报“新世纪”二十五日发表社论说：“印度关于朝鲜问题的提案采取了一个违反日内瓦公约的‘自愿’交换战俘的原则，事实上，这个提案怂恿战争贩子们对战俘加紧进行血腥屠杀。”
    【新华社新德里电】加尔各答出版的“自由报”十九日发表社论，评论印度出席世界人民和平大会代表团团长克其鲁博士所提出的关于解决朝鲜问题的提案，社论的题目是“在维也纳的印度提案”。社论说：“印度代表团团长克其鲁博士在世界人民和平大会上提出了立刻停止朝鲜战争的提案。来到维也纳参加这个大会的代表们是来自两个制度的领域的。不仅如此，其中还有人是热诚地信仰其自己的经济和社会制度的。在这样的一个国际会议上，印度执政党——国大党——的元老、印度代表团团长克其鲁博士把关于停止朝鲜战争的提案提出来，这一点是有特别意义的。如果我们再看一看最近世界的形势，那末其重大意义就很明显。
    在联合国，印度关于朝鲜问题的提案已为联合国多数所通过，然而朝鲜战争并未停止。但是印度在维也纳的代表却已无条件地要求‘立刻停止战争’了。
    必须迅速地把印度人民拥护维也纳世界人民和平大会的决议的力量组织起来。它必须成为维护和平的不可抗拒的力量。这股力量已从维也纳产生出来。现在印度人民就要擎起这面旗帜前进。”
