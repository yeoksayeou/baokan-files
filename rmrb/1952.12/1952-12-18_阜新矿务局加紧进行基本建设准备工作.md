    Fuxin Mining Bureau is systematically and thoroughly carrying out preparatory work for basic construction next year. The bureau already began focusing on key construction projects in 1951, with basic construction investment increasing year by year: the basic construction investment in 1952 was 4.5 times greater than in 1951, and in 1953 it will increase more than twofold compared to 1952. The large-scale open-pit mine will conclude its basic construction work on July 1st next year and officially commence production. The shaft construction of the Ping'an vertical shaft, built according to the latest Soviet technical standards, will be completed by the end of July next year. Another pair of new vertical shafts will also begin construction in the third quarter of next year. To prepare data for large-scale construction in the years to come, the bureau will need to complete over 60,000 meters of drilling next year, providing design data for three new mining areas. To lay the foundation for mechanized mine production, the bureau will begin construction next year on a large-scale machinery plant covering over 700,000 square meters. This machinery plant can produce more than 30 new products, such as drilling rigs, carding machines, and large mechanical parts. The bureau will also construct a massive water source well project next year, capable of supplying 10,000 to 30,000 cubic meters of water daily. To complete such a massive construction task, Fuxin Mining Bureau has learned from past experiences in basic construction and clearly recognizes that the quality of preparatory work is one of the most important factors in successfully completing the national plan next year. Therefore, it is timely concentrating its efforts on preparatory work.

    First, formulating plans cautiously: The bureau began studying next year's engineering projects in May of this year. In October, after the Northeast Coal Mining Administration issued a draft plan outline, the bureau organized a plan review committee headed by the Secretary of the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee and the bureau director. The plan review committee sent out six visiting investigation teams to extensively discuss next year's engineering projects with various production units and to examine the implementation of the 1952 plan, drawing lessons and experiences from it. The units put forward some principled revisions to the engineering projects, making the plan more realistic. At the same time, the bureau also organized a planning committee headed by the director, gathering 135 technicians and cadres to compile the plan. Before formally compiling the plan, the committee summarized past experiences in compiling plans, conducted various thematic reports and discussions, studied various relevant policy documents, rectified the thinking of planning personnel, and learned professional knowledge such as planning forms and budget quotas. Therefore, when formulating the plan, they were able to correctly understand the national industrial construction policy, particularly emphasizing the work of preparing conditions for future economic construction. For example, in next year's investment plan, the investment in resource exploration drilling work is four times that of this year, and the investment in cultural and educational construction (mainly used to cultivate and train reserve forces) is 27 times that of this year. This not only guarantees the current need for expanded reproduction but also prepares conditions for larger-scale construction in the future.

    Second, seizing design preparation: The bureau's design work for basic construction next year will be much heavier than this year. Some major projects need to be entrusted to foreign countries for design. The bureau has collected most of the necessary design data. It is expected that starting from January next year, it can be delivered to the technical design departments one after another. To ensure the timely submission of technical designs, the bureau has designated special personnel to maintain contact with various design institutions. The parts that need to be designed by the bureau itself have also been started. In addition to concentrating technical personnel and enriching design institutions, it also organizes design personnel to conduct various studies and organizes them to visit Shenyang and other places. The bureau will also make extensive use of the standard design drawings of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department to improve design speed and technical quality. Therefore, even with relatively weak design forces, it is expected that the bureau will be able to make preliminary designs and technical designs for various projects successively in April next year, ensuring that construction is not delayed.

    Third, do a good job in preparing for the ordering and transportation of equipment and materials. In the third quarter of this year, the bureau proposed orders based on the preliminary designs that had been determined, and accepted past lessons, establishing a specialized institution responsible for ordering. The materials needed for the projects to be constructed in the first quarter of next year have been ordered and will arrive successively soon. At the same time, in order to ensure a sufficient supply of equipment and materials, the transportation force must be greatly strengthened next year. With the assistance of the CPC Liaoxi Provincial Committee, the bureau has signed contracts with more than 400 horse-drawn carriages, which can successively transport equipment to the construction site starting from January next year.

    Fourth, vigorously organize construction forces to ensure the smooth progress of construction next year. Recently, the bureau has begun to fix its workforce of permanent workers, expecting to fix 4,500 various types of skilled workers. To solve the housing problems of these workers, the bureau has already built 1,600 square meters of workers' housing in the third quarter of this year. This winter, 30 training classes will be set up, preparing to train 3,005 cadres and workers, including 600 various professional personnel. At present, the carpentry and masonry training classes have already started, and cadres have been sent to various places to recruit workers. While conducting winter training, the bureau is preparing to promote a large number of cadres from workers and young intellectuals. More than 100 people will be promoted to construction workers and site directors. These people will become the main force for construction next year. In order to implement the industrialization and mechanization of construction, the bureau has built one woodworking factory and one iron factory, installing more than 20 various machines. Due to the use of standard designs, many building components such as doors and windows, roof frames, stairs, and reinforced concrete floor slabs can be prefabricated in winter. The bureau plans to invest more than 50 billion yuan in construction mechanization next year.

    Judging from the current situation, Fuxin Mining Bureau's preparatory work has been relatively thorough and meticulous. However, there are still some important issues that must be resolved as soon as possible. First of all, so far, the bureau still lacks a relatively comprehensive enterprise development plan. The construction plans of previous years have only been based on the partial needs of the enterprise, making it difficult for the enterprise's development to embark on a balanced and regular path. The bureau has recently paid attention to this issue. Secondly, although the bureau has made considerable efforts to strengthen basic construction forces in the past, from the perspective of future development needs, the basic construction forces are still insufficient. The most serious problem is the lack of technical cadres. For example, the number of civil engineering construction team leaders and site directors is only one-third of what is needed next year. According to the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, the bureau is continuing to transfer a large number of cadres from the production departments to enrich the basic construction departments.

    阜新矿务局加紧进行基本建设准备工作
    阜新矿务局正在有计划地周密地进行明年基本建设的准备工作。该局一九五一年就已经开始进行重点建设，基本建设的投资逐年增加：一九五二年的基本建设投资比一九五一年大四点五倍，一九五三年又比一九五二年增加一倍多。规模宏大的露天矿将于明年七月一日结束基本建设工作，正式开始生产。按照苏联最新技术标准建设的平安竖井的井筒工程，明年七月底就要完成。另外一对新竖井也将于明年第三季度开工。为了给明年以后的大规模建设准备资料，该局明年须要完成六万公尺以上的钻探任务，为三个新矿区提出设计资料。为了给矿山机械化生产打下基础，该局明年要开始建设规模宏大的占地七十多万平方公尺的机械厂。这个机械厂可以生产钻机、卡机等矿山机械以及大型机械零件等三十多种新产品。该局明年还将建设每日可以供水一万至三万立方公尺的巨大的水源井的工程。为要完成如此巨大的建设任务，阜新矿务局接受了过去基本建设工作的经验，明确地认识到，准备工作做得好坏，是明年能否顺利完成国家计划的最重要的因素之一，因而，及时地集中力量进行准备工作。
    首先，慎重地制订计划：该局今年五月就开始研究明年的工程项目。十月，东北煤矿管理局颁发了计划轮廓草案后，该局又以中共阜新市委书记和该局局长为首组织了计划审核委员会。计划审核委员会曾经派出了六个访问调查组，广泛和各生产单位商讨明年的工程项目，并检查了一九五二年计划的执行情况，从中取得经验教训，各单位曾经对工程项目提出了若干原则性的修正意见，使计划更切合实际。与此同时，该局又组织了以局长为首的计划委员会，集中技术人员和干部一三五名，编制计划。在正式编制计划前，委员会曾总结了过去编制计划的经验，进行了各种专题报告和讨论，学习各种有关的政策文件，端正计划人员思想，同时学习了计划表格、概算定额等业务知识。因此，在制订计划时，他们能够正确地体会国家工业建设的方针，特别重视为将来经济建设准备条件的工作。譬如，在明年投资计划中，资源探钻工作的投资相当于今年的四倍，文教建设（主要用于培养训练后备力量）的投资相当今年的二十七倍。这样，就不但保证了当前扩大再生产的需要，而且为将来的更大规模的建设准备了条件。
    第二，抓紧设计准备：该局明年基本建设的设计工作比今年要繁重得多。有些主要工程需要委托国外设计。该局已将大部分必需的设计资料搜集齐全。预计从明年一月起，就可以陆续交到做技术设计的部门。为了保证技术设计的及时提出，该局已指定专人与各设计机构保持联系。需要该局自行设计的部分亦已着手进行。除了集中技术人员，充实设计机构外，同时，还组织设计人员进行各种学习和组织他们到沈阳等地参观。该局并将大量采用东北人民政府工业部的标准设计图样，以提高设计速度和技术质量。因此，即使在设计力量比较薄弱的情况下，预计明年四月该局即可陆续做出各工程的初步设计和技术设计，保证不误施工。
    第三，做好设备、器材的订购与运输的准备工作。今年第三季度，该局就根据已经确定的初步设计提出订货，并接受过去教训，建立专门负责订货的机构。明年第一季度施工的工程所需要的材料，已经订购，最近可陆续到达。同时为了保证设备器材的充分供应，明年须要大大加强运输力量。该局已在中共辽西省委的协助下，与四百多台马车签订了合同，从明年一月起，就可以陆续向工地运送器材。
    第四，大力组织施工力量，保证明年施工顺利进行。最近该局已开始进行固定工人的工作，预计将固定各种技术工人四千五百名。为解决这些工人的住宿问题，今年第三季，该局即已修建了一千六百平方公尺的工人住宅。今年冬季要设立三十个训练班，准备训练三千零五名干部和工人，其中各种专业人员有六百名。现在，木、瓦工的训练班已经开始，并派出干部分别到各地招收工人。与冬季训练的同时，该局准备从工人和青年知识分子中提拔大批干部，仅施工员和工地主任就要提拔一百名以上，这些人员将要成为明年建设的生力军。为着实行施工工厂化与机械化，该局已经修建了木工厂和铁工厂各一个，安装各种机械二十余台。由于采用标准设计，许多建筑部件如门窗、房架、楼梯、钢筋混凝土楼板等，都可在冬季中预先制好。该局明年计划用于施工机械化的投资将达五百亿元以上。
    就目前的情况看，阜新矿务局的准备工作是做得比较充分、周密的。但是，也还有一些重要问题必须尽快解决。首先，到目前为止，该局还缺乏一个比较全面的企业发展计划。历年的建设计划，还只是从企业的局部需要出发，因而使企业的发展不易走上平衡的正规的道路。该局最近已经注意到这个问题。其次，该局过去虽然在加强基本建设力量上做了相当的努力，但从今后发展的需要来说，基本建设力量是仍感不够的，其中最严重的问题就是缺少技术干部。例如，土木建筑工程队长和工地主任才只有明年所需要的三分之一的人数。该局正根据中央财政经济委员会的指示，由生产部门继续大量抽调干部充实基本建设部门。    （丘耀初）
