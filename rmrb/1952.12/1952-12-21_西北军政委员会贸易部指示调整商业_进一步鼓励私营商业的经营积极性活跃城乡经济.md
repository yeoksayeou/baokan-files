To implement the spirit of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Sixth Meeting resolution on adjusting commerce, improve the relationship between public and private sectors, further encourage the business enthusiasm of private businesses, expand the exchange of goods, and invigorate the urban and rural economy, the Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee issued an urgent instruction on December 16 to the commercial bureaus, industry and commerce bureaus of five provinces and one city, and the Northwest regional professional companies. The instruction requires local industry and commerce administrative departments and state-owned trading organizations to implement the following points:

	1.	Rationally adjust regional price differences. According to the central government's established principles and the specific provisions of the Northwest Region's Second Price Conference, appropriately relax the price differences between urban and rural areas, provide private businesses with reasonable profits, and encourage private businesses to leverage their business enthusiasm.
	2.	Appropriately adjust the wholesale and retail price differences, and correct the past tendency of some large and medium-sized cities to reduce the wholesale and retail price differences, so that retail merchants can obtain reasonable profits.
	3.	Appropriately adjust the starting point for wholesale of goods. The practice of inappropriately changing wholesale to retail in some places must be corrected. The starting point for wholesale should be different in large, medium, and small cities, and should generally be higher in large cities than in medium and small cities.
	4.	Appropriately adjust and divide the business scope of public and private commerce. Except for certain important materials related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, private businesses should be allowed to operate more general commodities. State-owned trading companies, in addition to implementing the business policy of "wholesale as the main focus," retail business should be based on the standard of stabilizing retail prices.
	5.	Some inappropriate restrictions on private businesses in some places should be lifted immediately. Private businesses should not be restricted from operating in materials that are not explicitly managed and controlled by the People's Government, and state-owned trading companies must not perform the work of industry and commerce administration.
	6.	Strengthen the leadership of markets at all levels, especially primary markets, through business management, encourage and organize private businesses to operate industrial products, handicraft products, and local and special products, and give full play to their capital and manpower.

    西北军政委员会贸易部指示调整商业
    进一步鼓励私营商业的经营积极性活跃城乡经济
    西北军政委员会贸易部为贯彻西北军政委员会第六次会议关于调整商业决议的精神，以改进公私关系，进一步鼓励私营商业的经营积极性，扩大物资交流，活跃城乡经济，特于十二月十六日向五省一市商业厅、工商局及西北区级各专业公司发出紧急指示，指示各地工商行政部门与国营贸易机关必须贯彻执行以下各点：
    一、合理地调整地区差价。根据中央既定原则和西北区第二次物价会议的具体规定，适当放宽城乡差价，给予私商合理利润，鼓励私商发挥其经营上的积极性。
    二、适当调整批发零售差价，纠正过去某些大、中城市缩小批发零售差价的偏向，使零售商贩能获得合理利润。
    三、适当调整商品的批发起点。某些地方不适当地变批发为零售的作法必须纠正，批发起点在大、中、小城市应有不同，大城市一般应高于中、小城市。
    四、适当地调整和划分公私商业的经营范围。除有关国计民生的某些重要物资外，一般商品应多让私商经营。国营贸易公司除贯彻“批发为主”的经营方针外，零售业务应以能稳定零售价格为标准。
    五、某些地方对私商的某些不适当的限制应即取消。凡不是人民政府明令管理和管制的物资，不应限制私商经营，国营贸易公司并不得代行工商行政管理工作。
    六、通过经营管理加强对各级市场，特别是初级市场的领导，鼓励和组织私商经营工业品、手工业品和土、特产品，充分发挥其资金和人力的作用。
