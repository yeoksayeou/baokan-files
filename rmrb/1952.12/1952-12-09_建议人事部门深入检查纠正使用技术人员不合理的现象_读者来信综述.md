Summary of Readers' Letters

In order to welcome the motherland's large-scale economic construction work, concentrating cadres, allocating forces, and strengthening the organizational structure of basic construction are the primary tasks in the current preparatory work for basic construction. The rational use of technical personnel is an important issue in concentrating cadres and allocating forces. Recently, this newspaper has frequently received letters regarding the irrational use of technical personnel. These letters indicate that after this newspaper published the editorial "Put Specialized Technical Talents in the Positions Most Needed for Economic Construction" and the Central Personnel Department issued instructions to various regions to investigate, register, and adjust technical personnel, the phenomenon of irrational use of specialized technical talents has not been thoroughly corrected; at the same time, readers have also exposed the phenomenon of waste of talent in some basic construction units. This is mainly manifested in the following four aspects:

I. Assigning specialized technical talents to do general cultural, educational, and administrative work. Xinjiang reader Zhang Yunjin wrote: "Zhang Baoqin, a third-year student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiaotong University who graduated early this year, was recently assigned by the government to teach at the Yangshupu District Secondary Remedial School in Shanghai." Reader Tian Biguang wrote: "I graduated from the Dyeing and Weaving Department of Hubei Provincial Wuchang Senior Industrial School in 1950, and now I am doing clerical work at the Jilin Provincial Medical School. What I learned in the past is completely useless now." Reader Ren Zhongqi wrote: "I graduated from Hebei Provincial Fisheries College in July 1949. After graduating from the Huaibei Universities' Summer Graduates Study Group, I was uniformly assigned to work at the Huaibei Foreign Trade Company. Now I am working as a registrar and dispatcher in the Machinery Import Company, and what I learned is completely inconsistent with what I am doing."

II. Assigning specialized technical talents to economic construction posts to engage in technical work outside their field of expertise. Reader Wang Yujian wrote: "I am a graduate of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University this year. Now I have been assigned to work in the Northeast Coal Mine Administration. I studied power machinery at school, and the main courses were steam engines, steam turbines, steam power plants, steam locomotives, etc. There is a distance between steam power machinery and mining machinery. Because I don't understand the technical aspects of mining, I have nothing to do every day, just copying forms, printing mimeographs, calculating, or doing some statistical work." The reader also said that two of his classmates who studied motor manufacturing were assigned to work at the Jixi General Machinery Plant of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration. All the motors used in the plant are supplied by the Electric Power Bureau. Therefore, they also have nothing to do, just drawing circuit diagrams or doing some other work every day. Reader Hou Wenshi wrote that he graduated from a higher vocational school in dyeing and weaving, and has seven years of dyeing and weaving work experience. In September 1950, he was introduced by the Tianjin Labor Exchange to work at the Jinzhou Electric Motor Dyeing Factory. In February of this year, he was transferred to the Jinzhou Machinery Hardware Weighing Instrument Factory to do work that was completely incompatible with his technical conditions. He has repeatedly expressed his opinions to the leading comrades, but there has been no news of a transfer for more than four months.

III. Waste of technical personnel. A reader named Li Maohua wrote to reflect the waste of technical talents. He cited an example, saying: There is a construction site where concrete is being poured. The concrete team sent two technical cadres to lead the construction. In order to check the construction quality, the technical office also sent two comrades to participate in the work. However, the comrades from the technical office cannot command the workers. When there are problems, they must go through the engineering team and the workshop section, so the engineering team and the workshop section must also send two people each. In this way, a place that only needs one or two technical cadres has eight technical cadres, wasting six civil engineering personnel. There is an agency whose construction projects are seasonal. Every year, technical personnel have four or five months without work to do. The reader pointed out that the losses suffered by the state due to this waste of specialized technical talents are incalculable. Reader Zhai Xufan, who graduated early from the Manufacturing Group of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tianjin University this year and was assigned to work in the Northeast, wrote to expose the phenomenon of "overstaffing" of technical personnel at the Jixi General Machinery Plant of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration. For example, in the machine workshop, there is one assistant engineer, nine technicians, and three trainee technicians, who are often idle and have nothing to do. Some work that can be done by people with elementary school education also requires technical personnel to do it. In order to rationally use the country's limited number of technical personnel, he has made suggestions to the leadership, but they have not been resolved.

IV. Technical workers are not being used rationally. Reader Zhang Xueqin wrote that some specialized technical workers with six or seven years of technical work experience, such as electricians, ironworkers, radio technicians, and fitters, are doing odd jobs in some agencies in Beijing. They enthusiastically request to join the basic construction departments and dedicate their technology to the motherland. However, they are obstructed by the personnel departments of these agencies, the reason being: "Serving the people, all jobs are the same."

Readers unanimously believe that the reasons for the above unreasonable phenomena are mainly that the responsible cadres of some departments have departmentalism and insufficient understanding of the great significance of rationally using specialized technical talents; secondly, there are still serious irrational phenomena in the work system and personnel allocation of some industrial and mining enterprises, of course, this is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the leading comrades. Readers enthusiastically and responsibly put forward suggestions: They hope that the relevant personnel departments will further check the situation of rational use of technical personnel, and put the limited number of technical talents, especially the technical talents in geological exploration, design, and construction required for basic construction, first in the most needed jobs. It is suggested that the industrial and mining enterprise departments improve the work system, eliminate all loopholes that waste specialized technical talents, and give full play to the work enthusiasm of technical cadres so that they can better serve basic construction.

    建议人事部门深入检查纠正使用技术人员不合理的现象
    ——读者来信综述
    为了迎接祖国大规模的经济建设工作，集中干部，调配力量，充实基本建设的组织机构，是目前基本建设准备工作中的首要任务。而合理使用技术人员，则又是集中干部、调配力量方面的重要问题。最近本报经常收到有关技术人员未被合理使用的来信。这些信件说明，在本报发表“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论和中央人事部发出各地调查、登记、调整技术人员指示后，不合理使用专门技术人材的现象还没有彻底纠正；同时，读者也揭发了某些基本建设单位浪费人材的现象。这主要表现在以下四个方面：
    一、把专门技术人材分配去做一般的文教、行政工作。新疆读者张运锦来信说：“本年上海交通大学机械工程系三年级提前毕业的学生张宝琴，最近由政府统一分配在上海杨树浦区中等补习学校担任教师。”读者田必光来信说：“我是一九五○年湖北省立武昌高级工业学校染织科毕业的，现在吉林省医士学校做文书工作。过去所学的，现在完全用不上。”读者任忠奇来信说：“我是一九四九年七月河北省水产专科学校毕业的。在华北各大学暑期毕业生学习团结业后，统一分配到华北对外贸易公司工作。现在在机械进口公司作登记、收发工作，学用完全不一致。”
    二、把专门技术人材分配到经济建设岗位上担任非本行的技术工作。读者王玉俭来信说：“我是本届清华大学机械系的毕业生。现在被分配到东北煤矿管理局工作。在学校学的是动力机械，主要课程如蒸汽机、蒸汽轮、蒸汽动力厂、蒸汽机车等。蒸汽动力机械和矿山机械之间是有距离的。由于不懂矿山方面的技术，每天就没有什么事可做，只是抄表格、印油印、打算盘，或作一些统计工作。”读者还说，他有两位学电机制造的同学，被分配在东北煤矿管理局鸡西总机厂工作。该厂所用电机统由电工局供给。因此他们也没有什么工作好做，每天只是描描线路图，或作一些其他工作。读者侯问实来信说，他是高等职业学校染织科毕业的，有七年的染织工作经验。一九五○年九月，由天津劳动介绍所，介绍到锦州电机染厂工作。今年二月，被调到锦州机械五金衡器工厂，做完全和他的技术条件不适应的工作。他曾向领导同志多次提出意见，但已四个多月，仍无调动消息。
    三、对技术人员使用的浪费现象。一个署名李茂华的读者来信，反映了浪费技术人材的情况。他举了一个例子，说：有一个建筑工地，正在进行浇灌混凝土的工作。混凝土中队派了两位技术干部领导施工。为了检查施工质量，技术室也派来两位同志参加工作。但技术室的同志不能指挥工人，有问题时，必须通过工程大队和工场科，于是工程大队和工场科，也得各派来二人。这样一来，只要一两个技术干部的地方，就去了八个技术干部，浪费了六个土木工程方面的人力。有一个机关，它所进行的建设工程是有季节性的。每年技术人员有四、五个月没有工作做。读者指出，这种浪费专门技术人材的现象，使国家遭受的损失是无法估计的。今年天津大学机械系制造组提前毕业，被分配到东北工作的读者翟绪范来信，揭发了东北煤矿管理局鸡西总机厂技术人员“人浮于事”的现象。如机器车间有助理工程师一人，技术员九人，见习技术员三人，时常闲得无事可作。有的工作，只要有小学程度的人就可以做，却也要技术人员来做。为了合理使用国家仅有的少量的技术人员，他曾向领导上提出意见，但并没有得到解决。
    四、技术工人未被合理使用。读者张学勤来信说，有一部分具有六、七年技术工作经验的专门技术工人如电工、铁工、无线电工、钳工等，在北京有些机关作着勤杂工作。他们热烈地要求参加到基本建设部门去，把技术献给祖国。但是受到这些机关人事部门的阻挠，理由是：“为人民服务，那里工作都是一样”。
    读者一致认为，产生以上不合理现象的原因，主要是某些部门负责干部有本位主义思想及对合理使用专门技术人材的重大意义认识不够；其次是部分工矿企业的工作制度及人员配备上还存在着严重的不合理现象，当然，这和领导同志的官僚主义作风是分不开的。读者都热情、负责地提出建议：希望有关人事部门进一步检查合理使用技术人员的情况，把为数有限的技术人材，特别是基本建设所需要的地质勘察、设计、施工方面的技术人材，首先放到目前最需要的工作岗位上去。建议各工矿企业部门改进工作制度，杜绝一切浪费专门技术人材的漏洞，充分发挥技术干部的工作积极性，以便他们更好地为基本建设服务。
