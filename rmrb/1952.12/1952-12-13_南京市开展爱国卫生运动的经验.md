Nanjing's Experience in Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Lü Jianjun

    After the spring cleanup in April and the intensive campaign in June this year, the environmental sanitation in Nanjing has undergone significant changes. During the campaign, people cleared the garbage mountains left over from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era and cleaned up the thirty-li-long Qinhuai River, completing the water exchange project. In total, over 700 li of ditches and canals were dredged during the entire campaign; 1,286 stagnant water pits and 3,140 square feet were filled in. In addition, every household established a system of "a small sweep every day and a big sweep every three days." The 640 villages in the suburban areas of the city carried out more than two major cleanups, some villages even four or five times. The Third District Public Security Hospital cleaned the "Mingyuan Building," which had not been cleaned for a hundred years. The large-scale cleanup demonstrated the people's power to transform environmental sanitation. The shantytown formerly known as "Jin Chou River" (Entering Stinky River) has now restored its original name "Jin Xiang River" (Entering Fragrant River); the Wu Lao Village, once called "Troubled Village," has become "Happy Village."

    Along with the change in environmental sanitation, people's living habits have also undergone great changes. In the past, many families in the four villages of the Sixth District did not wash pots or dishes after meals, but now they have changed their habits, often washing pots and dishes, not leaving any dirt on them. Four masons in Jinxiang River in the Fourth District had not folded their quilts for decades, but now they have also changed their past habits, making "folding the quilt" the first thing they do after getting up. Chen Hongyu's family in Pukou Town, Seventh District, did not take a bath once in the past seven or eight years, but now they not only take baths regularly, but also started brushing their teeth. In short, "everyone loves cleanliness, and every family pays attention to hygiene" has become a social trend. Every "Patriotic Health Day" is marked by "gongs and drums, with every family cleaning up."

    In Nanjing, rat extermination, fly eradication, and mosquito control have become mass movements. According to preliminary statistics, the city killed 438,573,300 flies, captured 3,524,416,000 mosquitoes, scooped up 289,965 catties of mosquito larvae, eliminated more than 4.4 million bedbugs, and caught 345,420 rats.

    In addition, certain achievements have also been made in preventive vaccination, food and drinking water hygiene management, and sanitation construction. This year, the incidence and mortality rates in the city have been greatly reduced. For example, in Shanxi Nan Village in the Fifth District, 28 people fell ill last year, but no one has fallen ill this year. Mingshi Geng in the Sixth District often had deaths due to illness before liberation, but not only has this phenomenon not occurred this year, but even no one has fallen ill, so people call it "Little Paradise."

    The patriotic health campaign has not only improved the people's health but also increased the workers' and farmers' enthusiasm for production. For example, the Nanjing Oil Pressing Factory often had accidents last year because the sanitation work in the factory was not done well, and the lost working hours accounted for an average of 20% of the total monthly working hours; this year, because the cleaning work was done well, there were very few accidents in the factory, and the production efficiency has also improved. Dongxilin Village, a model village for patriotic health in the Ninth District, has increased its output by 100% this year because its sanitation work has been combined with production.

    The patriotic health campaign in Nanjing has also encountered various ideological obstacles. At the beginning of the campaign, many people regarded the health campaign as a routine matter that occurred once a year. Some even said, "This is the health department's business; doing it is a favor, and not doing it is our duty." Some people have feudal superstitious ideas, believing that "cesspools cannot be moved, moving them offends the earth god, and you will either get sick or encounter disasters"; "rats are psychic and can tell fortunes," and "ashes on the stove and grass on the beams cannot be swept away until the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month." Some people believe that "you can't talk about hygiene without money"; some residents of shantytowns and farmers in the suburbs believe that "only city people and people who live in foreign houses can talk about hygiene." These ideas have become obstacles to the campaign.

    In order to clarify the masses' various misconceptions about the health campaign, since April this year, Nanjing has organized more than 150,000 people to conduct propaganda among the masses in various forms. According to statistics, from April to the end of September, the city has cumulatively provided propaganda education to more than 2.8 million people. In the propaganda and education work, by combining the political propaganda against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism with health education, on the one hand, the masses realized that health work is a political task and actively participated in the movement; on the other hand, it greatly improved the masses' scientific health knowledge.

    In the propaganda and education work, Nanjing also adopted a method of combining learning, propaganda, and action. For example, university teachers, students, workers, farmers, cadres of government departments, and practitioners in the health industry who participated in health training, learned while conducting propaganda to the masses. The vast propaganda teams carried brooms and tools for catching flies and destroying maggots with them. While carrying out propaganda, they also conducted inspections; they cleaned and caught flies and inspected the sanitary conditions wherever they propagated. This eliminated the "dead corners" in health work and changed some people's misconceptions about cadres, making them realize that cadres do not "only talk and do not act." In order to conduct inspections more universally, deeply, and regularly, more than 1,000 inspection teams were established throughout the city; more than 12,000 inspections were carried out, and more than 2,400 units and more than 200,000 households were inspected. Even the city inspection team of more than 30 people, led by Vice Mayors Li Leping and Jin Shanbao, went out for inspection more than 20 times. During the surprise inspections, more than 94,000 people were mobilized throughout the city. During the inspection, because methods of combining leadership inspection and mass inspection, combining regular inspection and surprise inspection, and combining comprehensive inspection and key inspection were adopted, inspections were truly carried out at all levels, with each level being responsible. The vast number of residents inspected organs and schools, promoting the sanitation work of organs and schools.

    Another characteristic of Nanjing's sanitation work is that all forces that could be mobilized were organized. During the campaign, health leading departments at all levels sent working cadres deep into the masses to understand the situation at any time and conduct inspections and supervision. Health organizations were generally established in various units and residents. The mass sanitation shock teams, in the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Districts alone, numbered more than 1,000, with about 18,000 people. In addition, more than 1,500 reading groups were used in the movement to organize the vast number of housewives and social youths, making them the core and backbone forces of the movement. During the summer vacation, tens of thousands of students were organized to go to the countryside to work; from the end of July to the beginning of August, a major blitz and inspection for catching flies and destroying maggots was organized. First, the maggots were exterminated in places where flies and maggots were concentrated, and then all the garbage, weeds, and debris inside and outside the house were cleared to prevent flies from hiding. Then, every household was mobilized, and everyone took action, from indoors to outdoors, to kill all the flies around them.

    Nanjing's patriotic health campaign was carried out under the close leadership of the Party and the government. During the campaign, the leadership not only summarized the experience in a timely manner but also proposed the plans and central slogans for the next stage based on the development of each stage, so that the movement gradually deepened and improved. For example, after the cleanup campaign in April, serious complacency emerged among the masses, so a blitz plan was formulated in June, a large-scale anti-bacteriological warfare propaganda campaign and a red flag competition were launched, and the masses were promptly led to formulate patriotic health covenants. Then a wave of intensive campaigns was launched. After the end of the intensive campaign, in response to the masses' simplistic task-oriented view, the requirements of "not how many to kill, but to kill them all" and "not only to kill them all, but also to eliminate the roots of flies and mosquitoes" were put forward. And everyone was organized to visit advanced units to promote backward units. Then a new climax was set off. Subsequently, the masses generated the ideas of "take a breath" and "the movement is over," and the leadership put forward the call for "popularizing patriotic health days and revising patriotic health covenants" to make the movement more regular. By the end of September, most areas and units in the city had formulated patriotic health covenants. Now, residents in many areas not only pay attention to environmental sanitation but also pay attention to personal hygiene. In October, model patriotic health workers were summarized and evaluated, and specific plans for winter sanitation work were drawn up to enable the patriotic health campaign to continue to develop and improve.

    Nanjing's patriotic health campaign also has some shortcomings. For example, the propaganda and education work of scientific health knowledge and the management of the catering industry are not done well enough; the sanitation work in some areas and units has the tendency of formalism, and there are still "dead corners." Therefore, Nanjing will continue to implement the working principles of "facing workers and peasants, facing production" and "prevention first" in the future, strengthen the leadership of factory and rural sanitation work, and make sanitation work serve workers, peasants, and production. At the same time, further organize forces to eliminate "dead corners" in work, promote backward areas, and raise the level of sanitation work in the city to the level of advanced units; consolidate and improve grassroots health organizations and health work systems, continue to carry out political and scientific health knowledge propaganda and education to the masses, universally launch the movement to inspect and revise patriotic health covenants and the movement to dig out pupae, and make health work regular.

    南京市开展爱国卫生运动的经验
    吕健军
    经过今年四月的春季清扫和六月突击等运动，南京市的环境卫生面貌起了显著的变化。在运动中，人们把太平天国时代遗留下来的垃圾山清除了，把长达三十里的秦淮河也打捞干净，并且完成了换水工程。总计在整个运动中疏通沟渠七百多里；填平死水坑一千二百八十六处又三千一百四十平方尺。另外，家家户户都建立了“一天一小扫，三天一大扫”的制度。市郊区六百四十个村庄，都进行了两次以上的大扫除，有的村庄进行了四、五次。三区公安医院清扫了一百年来未打扫过的“明远楼”。大规模的清扫工作，表现了人民改造环境卫生的力量。过去称为“进臭河”的棚户区，现在恢复了原来的名称“进香河”；曾被称为“苦恼村”的五老村成了“欢乐村”。
    随着环境卫生的改变，人民的生活习惯也起了大的变化。六区四所村过去有不少人家吃了饭不涮锅不洗碗，现在他们的习惯改变了，经常涮锅洗碗，不让锅碗上留下一点脏。四区进香河有四个瓦匠，几十年来没有叠过被，现在他们也改变了过去的习惯，把“叠被”当作起身后第一件事情。七区浦口镇陈洪宇家，过去七、八年不洗一次澡，现在不仅经常洗澡，而且开始刷牙了。总之，“人人爱清洁，家家讲卫生”已成为社会风气，每逢“爱国卫生日”，都是“锣鼓一敲，家家打扫”。
    在南京市，捕鼠、灭蝇、灭蚊成为群众性的运动。据初步统计，全市扑蝇四亿三千八百五十七万三千只，捕蚊三十五亿二千四百十六万只，捞孑孓二十八万九千九百六十五斤，消灭臭虫四百四十多万只，捕鼠三十四万五千四百二十只。
    另外，在预防注射、饮食、饮水卫生管理和卫生建设方面，也都取得了一定的成绩。今年全市的发病率和死亡率大为降低。例如第五区山西南村，去年有二十八人生病，今年没有一人生病。六区的名士埂，解放前经常发生因病死亡的事件，今年不但没有发生这种现象，连生病的也没有，人们便称它为“小天堂”了。
    爱国卫生运动不仅提高了人民的健康水平，也提高了工人和农民的生产热情。例如南京榨油厂，去年因为厂内的卫生工作做得不好，经常发生事故，耽误的工时平均占全月工时的百分之二十；今年因清扫工作做得好，厂内很少发生事故，生产效率也就提高了。九区爱国卫生模范村东西林村，由于卫生工作结合了生产，全村今年的产量比去年增多了一倍。
    南京市爱国卫生运动也曾受到种种的思想阻碍。在运动开始时，许多人把卫生运动当做一年一度的例行公事看待。甚至有人说：“这是卫生所的事，干是情份，不干是本份。”有些人有封建迷信思想，他们认为“粪坑不能动，动了犯土，不生病就遇灾”；“老鼠有灵、会算卦”，“灶上灰、梁上草，不到腊月二十八不能扫”。有的人认为“没得钱就不能讲卫生”；有些棚户区的居民和郊区农民则认为“只有城里人和住洋房子的才能讲卫生”。这些思想也就成为运动的障碍。
    为了澄清群众对卫生运动的各种错误认识，今年四月份以来，南京市曾组织了十五万多人，用各种宣传形式，向群众进行了宣传。据统计，从四月到九月底，全市累计有二百八十多万人受到了宣传教育。在宣传教育工作中，由于把反对美帝国主义细菌战的政治宣传和卫生教育结合了起来，一方面使群众认识到卫生工作是一个政治任务，积极地参加到运动中去；一方面大大提高了群众的科学卫生知识水平。
    在宣传教育工作中，南京市还采取了学习、宣传和行动相结合的方法。例如参加卫生训练的大学教师、学生、工人、农民、机关干部以及卫生行业从业员，一边学一边向群众进行宣传。广大的宣传队伍，则随身带着扫帚和捕蝇灭蛆工具，他们一面进行宣传，一面进行检查；宣传到那里，就在那里打扫捕蝇，检查卫生情况。这就消灭了卫生工作中的“死角”，同时改变了某些群众对干部的错误看法，使他们认识到干部并不是“只动嘴不动手”的。为了比较普遍地、深入地、经常地进行检查，全市成立了一千个以上的检查组；出动检查了一万二千多次，受检查的有两千四百多个单位、二十多万户。单是以李乐平、金善宝副市长为首的市检查团三十多人，就出动检查了二十多次。而在突击检查时，全市曾出动了九万四千多人。在检查时，由于采取了领导检查和群众检查相结合、经常检查和突击检查相结合、全面检查和重点检查相结合的方法，因而真正做到了层层检查、级级负责。广大的居民检查了机关学校，推动了机关、学校的卫生工作。
    南京市卫生工作的另一特点是，一切可以动用的力量都被组织起来了。在运动中，各级卫生领导部门派工作干部深入群众，随时了解情况，并进行检查督促。各单位和居民中普遍建立了卫生组织。群众性的卫生工作突击队，仅二、五、六三个区就有一千多个，约一万八千多人。另外，在运动中还运用了一千五百多个读报组，通过它们组织广大的家庭妇女和社会青年，使他们成为运动的核心和骨干力量。在暑假期间，又组织了上万的学生下乡工作；七月底——八月初，又组织了捕蝇灭蛆大突击、大检查，首先在蝇蛆集中的地方，把蛆灭光，接着清除室内外所有的垃圾杂草，不使苍蝇有藏身之地。然后家家动员，人人动手，从室内打到室外，把周围的苍蝇全部打光。
    南京市的爱国卫生运动是在党和政府的密切领导下进行的。在运动中，领导方面不仅及时总结经验，并根据每一阶段的发展情况提出下一阶段的计划和中心口号，使运动逐步深入，逐步提高。例如四月份清扫运动过去以后，群众中产生了严重的麻痹思想，便在六月份制订了突击计划，开展了大规模的反细菌战的宣传运动和红旗竞赛，并及时领导群众订立了爱国卫生公约。接着就掀起了突击运动的热潮。突击运动结束后，又针对群众的单纯任务观点提出“不是打多少，而是要打光”、“不仅要打光，而且要灭掉苍蝇蚊子的根子”的要求。并组织大家参观先进单位，以推动落后单位。于是又掀起了新的高潮。随后群众中又产生了“松一口气”、“运动过去了”的思想，领导方面便又提出“普遍推行爱国卫生日，修订爱国卫生公约”的号召，使运动转入经常化。到九月底为止，全市大部分地区和单位订立了爱国卫生公约。现在很多地区的居民不仅注意环境卫生，也注意到了个人卫生。十月间总结评选了爱国卫生模范，订出了冬季卫生工作的具体计划，以便使爱国卫生运动继续发展提高。
    南京市的爱国卫生运动，也还存在着若干缺点。例如科学卫生知识的宣传教育工作和饮食业的管理工作，都还做得不够好；某些地区和单位的卫生工作有形式主义的偏向，而且还有“死角”。因此，南京市今后将继续贯彻“面向工农、面向生产”和“预防为主”的工作方针，加强对工厂和农村卫生工作的领导，使卫生工作为工农服务，为生产服务。同时，进一步组织力量，消灭工作中的“死角”，推动落后地区，把全市的卫生工作水平提高到先进单位的水平；巩固和健全基层卫生组织和卫生工作制度，继续向群众进行政治和科学卫生知识的宣传教育，普遍展开检查、修订爱国卫生公约的运动和挖蛹运动，使卫生工作经常化起来。
