To adapt to the nationwide planned large-scale economic and cultural construction that is about to begin, and to strengthen the centralization of national work, the 19th Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the "Decision of the Central People's Government on Changing the Organizations and Tasks of the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Political Committees)," the "Resolution on Adjusting the Establishment of Provinces and Regions," and the "Resolution on Increasing the Institutions of the Central People's Government." After the promulgation of the aforementioned decisions and resolutions, they were warmly supported by the broad masses of the people in Northeast China and the people's governments at all levels. On November 28th, the Northeast People's Government Committee held its fourth enlarged meeting to discuss how to specifically implement the aforementioned decisions and resolutions passed by the 19th Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee.

The following attended the meeting: Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government; Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairmen; Zhang Mingyuan, Secretary-General; and committee members Zhang Xiushan, Wang Jinxiang, Zhang Weizhen, Gu Zhuoxin, Che Xiangchen, Zhu Dehai, Du Zheheng, Luo Chengde, Liu Zhiming, Guan Junyan, Feng Wu, Rao Bin, Li Yanlu, Yan Guhang, Jin Shuliang, Wang Zhizhi, and more than 20 others; representatives attending as observers included heads of departments, commissions, institutes, administrations, and bureaus of the Northeast People's Government, various mass organizations at the Northeast level, and the mayor and deputy mayors of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, totaling more than 50 people.

At the beginning of the meeting, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, delivered a report. He systematically summarized the various tasks of the Northeast People's Government over the past three years, pointed out the great achievements in industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, cooperative undertakings, culture and art, and the gradual improvement of people's lives, and explained that the Northeast People's Government had victoriously completed the policy guidelines and tasks discussed, passed, and approved by the Central People's Government in the first government committee meeting, enabling the national economy of the Northeast region to achieve tremendous development. In his report, Gao Gang pointed out that the achievements mentioned above were the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the CPC Central Committee, and the Central People's Government, the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the hard work of all the people in Northeast China, the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, and the active work of all staff members.

Gao Gang then elaborated on the significance of the Central People's Government's decision to change the organizational structure of the greater administrative regions and put forward suggestions regarding the work tasks of the Northeast region in 1953. He expressed his full support for the decision of the Central People's Government. He called on the participants to actively implement the spirit of the decision. He said: "We must actively support and implement the central decision, submit to the needs of national centralization and unity, prevent slackening, and not think that because some bureaus are directly managed by the central competent departments, the greater administrative region can reduce its responsibility. In the future, we should still guide and supervise the implementation of the central government's guidelines, policies, and tasks with the greatest effort. After the new institutions are established, all cadres should work actively, create new experiences, and effectively do a good job in all aspects of work. To this end, everyone should work hard to study political theory, delve into their professional work, recognize their own positions, and strengthen the accuracy of their work in order to complete more arduous tasks."

Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, then delivered a report at the meeting. He first expressed his full support for the decision of the Central People's Government and stated that he would work hard to better complete future tasks. Lin Feng said: In the future, we must promptly and thoroughly inspect our work, promptly report the situation to the Central People's Government, put forward suggestions, and guide and supervise various tasks in the Northeast region. The establishment of new institutions has strengthened rather than reduced our responsibilities. Therefore, in the process of reorganization, every cadre must adhere to the highest principles of serving the country and the tasks at hand, and there should be no fluctuations or lack of a sense of responsibility. Next, Lin Feng put forward a draft proposal to the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding the adjustment and establishment of new organizational structures, designated temporary responsible cadres for various committees, bureaus, and departments, and required all units to immediately carry out reorganization work. Once the Central People's Government's appointments of members of the Northeast Administrative Committee and its organizational structure are announced, the new institutions will begin work immediately. He also pointed out the specific issues that should be paid attention to in the reorganization process.

Subsequently, Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, spoke. He conveyed the spirit and process of the 19th Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, expressed his full support for the decisions of this meeting, and fully agreed with the reports of Chairman Gao Gang and Vice Chairman Lin Feng. In addition, he also reported to the conference on the situation of the judicial reform movement in the Northeast region.

Feng Wu, Director of the Northeast Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Che Xiangchen, one of the persons in charge of the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League, also spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they unanimously supported the decision of the Central People's Government Committee and the reports of Chairman Gao Gang and Vice Chairman Lin Feng of the Northeast People's Government, and expressed their willingness to work tirelessly to realize the above decisions and tasks. Che Xiangchen said in his speech: "This change is progressive and developmental, and it is very beneficial to the large-scale economic construction in the future. Therefore, I feel honored for the work in the future. I must study hard, improve my awareness, study my profession, and deeply inspect my work. I am determined to use all my strength to make the youth of Northeast China physically fit and strong so that they can better serve the motherland." Feng Wu also reported at the meeting on his experience in participating in the second consolation delegation to North Korea to comfort wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army.

The meeting ended on the same day. After the attendees returned to their respective posts, the reorganization work began immediately. This work was led by Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government.
