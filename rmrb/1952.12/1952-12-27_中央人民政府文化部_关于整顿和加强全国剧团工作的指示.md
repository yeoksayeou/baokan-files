    Instructions of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government
    Regarding the Rectification and Strengthening of the Work of National Theatrical Troupes

    In order to further develop the people's drama cause and make it conform to the current needs of the people, it is necessary to rectify and strengthen the national theatrical troupes in the following ways:

    1.  Strengthen state-owned theatrical troupes. State-owned theatrical troupes are the main force of the people's drama cause. Efforts should be made to improve and enhance them in terms of the ideological content of the repertoire, performing arts, and management of the troupes, so that drama art can more closely cooperate with national construction, enrich the people's spiritual life, cultivate the people's noble moral character, and more effectively serve the broad masses of the people.

    At present, many state-owned theatrical troupes lack a clear work policy and development direction. Because these troupes do not have a fixed repertoire and have too many temporary evening performances and other social activities, they cannot perform regularly in theaters, which leads to their separation from the audience and the normal development path of drama art. In the future, state-owned drama troupes and opera troupes should change the nature of their past literary and art propaganda teams and become specialized troupes, gradually building theater art. State-owned traditional opera troupes should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," continue to maintain theater performances and pay attention to performing new repertoires and improving performing arts, playing a demonstration role in the reform of traditional opera.

    In order to implement this policy, state-owned theatrical troupes should earnestly do the following three points:

    First, establish a normal repertoire performance system. State-owned theatrical troupes must formulate a repertoire performance plan for the next quarter or the second half of the year every three months or every six months. After this plan is reviewed and approved by the directly subordinate competent authority, it should be guaranteed to be implemented in accordance with the plan and should not be changed arbitrarily. All repertoires to be performed, whether old or newly created, must be carefully selected and reviewed to ensure the ideological and artistic quality of the performances. State-owned theatrical troupes should regularly organize their old repertoires and rehearse new repertoires to gradually accumulate a set of relatively excellent preserved repertoires, and strive to improve their performing arts. Drama troupes should mainly perform scripts that reflect the current life of the people, and appropriately introduce excellent scripts from foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union. Traditional opera troupes should establish a director system to ensure the gradual improvement and enhancement of their performing arts and music.

    Second, state-owned traditional opera troupes should perform in theaters for at least six months each year; state-owned drama troupes and opera troupes should perform in theaters for at least four months each year. In addition, state-owned theatrical troupes should spend two or three months each year touring factories, rural areas, or military units. In order to meet the artistic needs of the masses in factories, rural areas, and military units outside the urban areas, local state-owned theatrical troupes and cultural authorities should, in accordance with needs and possibilities, conclude collective contracts for touring performances with all relevant parties and implement them on schedule. As for cadres of various levels in urban areas watching operas, they should generally adopt the method of buying tickets or booking the whole venue, and abolish the current method of finding theatrical troupes to hold evening performances in government departments. At present, many state-owned theatrical troupes spend too much time on evening performances for government departments and organizations, which is very inappropriate.

    Third, state-owned theatrical troupes should adopt the policy of enterprise management so that they can gradually achieve self-sufficiency. Cultural authorities at all levels should designate affiliated theaters to sign contracts with affiliated theatrical troupes to ensure that the troupes have fixed performance venues; when conditions are ripe, the theaters can be handed over to the affiliated theatrical troupes for management. State-owned theatrical troupes should oppose the idea of simply relying on government supply, and should also prevent the erroneous view of purely making profits.

    2.  Strengthen the leadership and management of private theatrical troupes. All private professional theatrical troupes should register with the local cultural authorities of the people's government above the county level and report to the cultural authorities of the provincial (municipal) people's government for approval. The regulations for the registration of private theatrical troupes will be formulated separately.

    Many private theatrical troupes still retain various unreasonable systems left over from old traditional opera troupes, which seriously hinder the development of the drama cause. Necessary reforms should be carried out on these unreasonable systems. However, this reform must be carried out soundly under the strong leadership of the cultural authorities above the provincial (municipal) level and after full preparations have been made. This reform should not be carried out without leadership and without preparation. The cultural authorities of each province (municipality) should formulate specific plans, and after reporting them to the Ministry of Culture for approval, lead the local private theatrical troupes to carry out democratic reforms resolutely and extremely cautiously and in a step-by-step manner.

    Private theatrical troupes that have undergone democratic reforms and have a higher political and artistic level in their performance programs and performing arts can be changed to private-public-assisted theatrical troupes by the cultural authorities of the provincial, municipal, or special zone people's government, according to the needs of local opera work and on the principle of voluntary participation of the troupes, after reporting to the people's government cultural authorities at the next higher level for approval.

    Cultural authorities at all levels should provide specific leadership and assistance to the above-mentioned private-public-assisted theatrical troupes, such as helping them carry out political study, cultural study, and business study, helping them formulate performance plans, providing scripts, and providing appropriate economic subsidies, and when necessary, they can also dispatch cadres to assist them in their work. The cadres sent by the government should pay attention to studying the business, closely cooperate with the artists, and work together to carry out the reform of opera art. The supply and treatment of cadres are generally borne by the local government and should not be paid for within the troupe.

    3.  The cultural authorities of major administrative regions and provinces and cities with conditions should cooperate with literary and art organizations to vigorously organize literary and art writers to create various scripts that express modern life, and organize literary and art writers to cooperate with opera artists to systematically and step-by-step carry out the sorting and modification of local popular old scripts. When revising old scripts, it is necessary to prevent a crude attitude towards artistic heritage. After various opera scripts have been revised and sorted out, they shall be reviewed and approved by the cultural authorities of each major administrative region and sent to the Ministry of Culture for approval. At present, there is a phenomenon of indiscriminately banning and revising old opera scripts in many places, which is a serious violation of the opera reform policy and must be resolutely corrected. Certain opera scripts that are seriously harmful to the people must be banned from performance. The local cultural authorities should put forward their opinions and submit the original scripts to the Ministry of Culture level by level for unified review and handling. Before the Ministry of Culture approves the ban on performance, no organs or organizations may arbitrarily prohibit its performance.

    4.  Cultural authorities at all levels should pay attention to appropriately improving the lives of actors and earnestly protecting the health of actors, and first establish a normal life and study system in state-owned theatrical troupes that is conducive to the artistic creation of actors. Improving the art of actors and protecting and cultivating excellent actors are important tasks in building drama art. At present, the main actors of many state-owned theatrical troupes have assumed the administrative work of the troupes, which hinders their artistic study and improvement, which must be resolutely changed. In the future, the administrative affairs work and enterprise management of state-owned theatrical troupes should be entrusted to specialized cadres to be responsible for leadership, and the main actors should not participate in administrative affairs work or enterprise management work, but must participate in the troupe's high-level art meetings and participate in discussing important decisions on art work in the troupe; they can also take on appropriate artistic leadership work. In addition, at present, there are still erroneous phenomena such as excessive meetings, egalitarianism, extreme democracy, and contempt for veteran artists in many theatrical troupes, which should also be resolutely corrected.

    Local cultural authorities must pay attention to improving the political and artistic accomplishment of actors, and provide them with ample opportunities to experience life in accordance with the needs of improving thought and artistic creation. At present, many theatrical troupes rigidly apply a set of methods for studying in organs to daily political study, which is inappropriate. In the future, the political study of theatrical troupes should generally be conducted by means of special lectures and regular examinations under the leadership of the local cultural authorities, in order to effectively achieve the effect of learning. Local cultural authorities should improve the artistic accomplishment of opera artists by appropriate methods, and step by step carry out the education of quick literacy methods for illiterate or semi-literate opera artists to gradually improve their cultural level. Drama troupes and opera troupes should pay special attention to the technical training of actors. Opera troupes should regard the study of national opera heritage as the primary task of their artistic study.

    State-owned theatrical troupes should always pay attention to discovering and absorbing talented actors from amateur art groups of workers and peasants or folk artists, and traditional opera troupes should also recruit veteran artists with artistic accomplishments to serve as guides and consultants.

    In order to train new opera actors, the opera research institutes in major administrative regions and theaters with conditions may, with the approval of the Ministry of Culture, set up attached actor schools or actor training classes.

    5.  In addition to the above-mentioned drama, opera, and various opera troupes, local cultural authorities should also pay attention to developing professional and semi-professional shadow play and puppet drama troupes, reviewing and supplying their performance scripts, improving and promoting their performance techniques, and improving the political and cultural level of artists.

    6.  Local cultural authorities should strengthen the guidance of rural amateur theatrical troupes through cultural centers and cultural stations, and closely cooperate with local trade union organizations to develop amateur drama activities for workers and staff in organs. State-owned theatrical troupes, especially drama troupes and opera troupes, should establish regular and fixed guidance relationships with one or two local worker or peasant amateur theatrical troupes; assist them in their writing, directing, and performance work, assist them in summarizing experience, cultivate typical examples, and learn from the masses through this.

    7.  In accordance with the "Instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Reform of Opera Work" in May 1951, all theatrical troupes in various localities should be uniformly led by the cultural authorities. Cultural authorities at all levels should strengthen the management of the performance repertoires and performance activities of theatrical troupes. The chaotic phenomenon of no leadership or multi-headed leadership of theatrical troupes in some places must be effectively changed.

### 中央人民政府文化部  关于整顿和加强全国剧团工作的指示

    中央人民政府文化部
    关于整顿和加强全国剧团工作的指示
    为进一步发展人民戏剧事业，使符合于当前人民的需要，必须对全国剧团按如下方法加以整顿和加强：
    一、加强国营剧团。国营剧团是人民戏剧事业的主要力量，应在剧目思想内容上、表演艺术上和剧团的经营管理上，力求改进和提高，使戏剧艺术更密切地配合国家建设，丰富人民的精神生活，培养人民的高尚道德品质，更有效地为广大人民服务。
    目前许多国营剧团缺乏明确的工作方针和发展方向。这些剧团由于没有固定上演的剧目，加以临时性的晚会演出及其他社会活动过多，不能经常在剧场演出，以致脱离了观众，也脱离了戏剧艺术正常发展的轨道。今后国营话剧团、歌剧团，应改变其已往文工团综合性宣传队的性质，成为专业化的剧团，并逐步建设剧场艺术。国营戏曲剧团，应根据毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，除继续保持剧场演出外，并应注意演出新剧目和改进表演艺术，在戏曲改革工作中起示范作用。
    为了执行这个方针，国营剧团应切实做到以下三点：
    第一、建立正常的剧目上演制度。国营剧团必须每三个月或每半年订定下一季度或下半年的剧目上演计划，此项计划经直属的主管机关审核批准后，应保证按计划切实执行，不得任意变动。凡上演的剧目，不论是旧有的或新创作的，都需经过慎重的选择和审查，以保证演出的思想和艺术的质量。国营剧团应经常整理自己的旧有剧目和排演新剧目，以逐渐积累出一套比较优秀的保留剧目，并在表演艺术上力求改进。话剧团主要应上演反映当前人民生活的剧本，并适当地介绍外国特别是苏联的优秀剧本。戏曲剧团应建立导演制度，以保证其表演艺术上和音乐上逐步的改进和提高。
    第二、国营戏曲剧团每年至少应有六个月在剧场公演；国营话剧团、歌剧团每年至少应有四个月在剧场公演。此外，国营剧团每年应有两三个月的时间到工厂、农村或部队巡回演出。为使市区以外的工厂、农村和部队群众的艺术要求得到应有的满足，各地国营剧团和文化主管部门应与各有关方面根据需要和可能订立巡回演出的集体合同，按期实施。至于市区的各级机关人员看戏，一般地都应当采取买票或包场的办法，废除现行的找剧团到机关内举行晚会演出的办法。目前许多国营剧团为机关团体的晚会演出占去了过多的时间，这是很不适当的。
    第三、国营剧团应采取企业经营的方针，使其能逐步达到自给。各级文化主管部门，应指定所属剧场与所属剧团订立合同，以保证剧团得到固定的演出场所；在条件成熟时，可将剧场交与所属剧团经营管理。国营剧团应该反对单纯依靠政府供给的思想，也应该防止单纯营利的错误观点。
    二、加强对私营剧团的领导和管理。凡私营的职业剧团，应向当地县以上人民政府文化主管部门进行登记，报请省（市）人民政府文化主管部门核准。私营剧团登记条例另订之。
    私营剧团中有不少还保留了旧戏曲班社遗留下来的各种不合理的制度，严重地妨害戏剧事业的发展。对这些不合理的制度应进行必要的改革。但是这种改革必须在省（市）级以上文化主管部门的坚强领导之下，并作好充分准备之后才能健全地进行，不应当无领导无准备地进行这种改革。各省
    （市）文化主管部门应当订出具体计划，在报经中央文化部批准后，领导当地私营剧团坚决地并极其慎重地有步骤地进行民主改革。
    私营剧团经过民主改革，在演出节目和表演艺术上具有较高政治和艺术水平者，可由省、市或专区人民政府文化主管部门根据当地戏曲工作的需要，在剧团自愿的原则下，报请上一级的人民政府文化主管部门核准后，改为私营公助剧团。
    各级文化主管部门对上述私营公助剧团应加以具体的领导和协助，如帮助他们进行政治学习、文化学习和业务学习，帮助制订演出计划，供应剧本，并酌量予以经济上的补贴，必要时并得派遣干部协助其工作。政府所派干部应注意研究业务，与艺人密切合作，同心协力进行戏曲艺术的改革工作。干部的供给待遇一般由当地政府负担，不得在剧团内开支。
    三、各大行政区和有条件的省、市文化主管部门应协同文艺团体大力组织文艺作家创作表现现代生活的各种剧本，并组织文艺作家与戏曲艺人合作，有计划、有步骤地进行当地流行的旧有剧本的整理和修改工作。在修改旧有剧本时，必须防止对于艺术遗产的粗暴态度。各种戏曲剧本经修改整理后，由各该大行政区文化主管部门审定，送中央文化部批准。目前许多地方存在着对旧有戏曲剧本滥禁乱改的现象，这是严重地违反戏曲改革政策的，必须坚决加以纠正。某些对人民有严重毒害的戏曲剧本必须加以禁演者，应由当地文化主管部门提出意见，将原剧本逐级呈报中央文化部统一审查和处理。在未经中央文化部批准禁演前，任何机关团体不得随意禁止其演出。
    四、各级文化主管部门应注意适当地改善演员生活，切实地保护演员健康，首先在国营剧团内建立有利于演员艺术创作的正常的生活学习制度。提高演员艺术，保护和培养优秀演员，是建设戏剧艺术的重要任务。目前许多国营剧团的主要演员都担任了剧团的行政工作，妨害了他们艺术上的进修和提高，这是必须坚决改变的。今后国营剧团的行政事务工作和企业管理，应责成专门干部负责领导，主要演员不参加行政事务工作或企业管理工作，但必须参加剧团的高级艺术会议，参与商讨团内有关艺术工作的重要决定；也可担任适当的艺术领导工作。此外，目前许多剧团中还存在着会议过多、平均主义、极端民主和轻视老艺人等错误现象，也应当坚决纠正。
    各地文化主管部门必须注意提高演员的政治修养和文艺修养，并按照提高思想和艺术创造的需要，使他们有充分机会体验生活。目前许多剧团在日常的政治学习上，把机关学习的一套方法生硬地搬来运用，这是不适当的。今后剧团的政治学习，应在当地文化主管部门领导下，一般采取专人讲授和定期考试的办法来进行，以期切实收到学习的效果。各地文化主管部门应以适当的方法提高戏曲艺人的文艺修养，并有步骤地对戏曲艺人中的文盲或半文盲进行速成识字法的教育，以逐步提高其文化水平。话剧团、歌剧团应特别注意演员的技术训练。歌剧团应将学习民族戏曲遗产作为自己艺术学习的首要任务。
    国营剧团应经常注意从工、农群众业余艺术团体中或民间艺人中发现和吸收有天才的演员，戏曲剧团并应网罗有艺术素养的老艺人担任指导和顾问工作。
    为培养新的戏曲演员，各大行政区戏曲研究院及有条件的剧院，经中央文化部批准，得附设演员学校或演员训练班。
    五、除上述话剧，歌剧和各种戏曲剧团外，各地文化主管部门并应注意发展职业性和半职业性的皮影戏、傀儡戏剧团，审定和供给其演出剧本，改进和推广其演出技术，并提高艺人的政治文化水平。
    六、各地文化主管部门应经过文化馆、文化站，加强对农村业余剧团的指导，并与当地工会组织密切合作，发展工人和机关职工的业余戏剧活动。国营剧团，首先是话剧团、歌剧团，应与当地一两个工人或农民业余剧团建立经常的、固定的辅导关系；协助他们的编、导、演出工作，协助他们总结经验，培养典型，并借此向群众学习。
    七、遵照一九五一年五月“中央人民政府政务院关于戏曲改革工作的指示”，各地剧团应一律由文化主管部门统一领导。各级文化主管部门应加强对剧团的上演剧目和演出活动的管理。某些地方对剧团无领导或多头领导的混乱现象必须切实改变。
    一九五二年十二月二十六日
