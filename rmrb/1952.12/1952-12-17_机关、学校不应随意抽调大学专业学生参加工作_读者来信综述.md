    Agencies and Schools Should Not Randomly Transfer University Students Majoring in Specialized Fields to Work
    ——Reader Letters Summary

    Within the week from December 1st to 7th, this newspaper received reader letters regarding the rational use of specialized technical talent, reflecting the unreasonable phenomenon of some agencies randomly transferring university students majoring in specialized fields to do non-technical work. This is manifested in the following aspects:

    I. Transferring university students to do administrative work: Wu Yunlin and Liu Weilian from Tianjin University wrote, "At the end of last year, some students from Tianjin University majoring in metallurgy, electrical engineering, water conservancy, and chemical engineering were transferred by certain units to do other work (the details are not well understood; it is said they were transferred to do public security work). Some of them have studied specialized technology for two or three years. We believe this is a waste of national talent. We hope they will be transferred back to industrial construction posts or sent back to school to continue their studies."

    II. Transferring students to participate in tutoring work: Reader Tang Zuoliang wrote, "I was originally a student in the Electrical Engineering Department of Northwest Institute of Technology. I should have graduated last July; however, in March of last year, I was transferred by the school to work as a political teaching assistant. After the People's Daily called for the rational use of specialized technical talent, I thought I should return to a technical work post. It is not that I do not consider the school's current shortage of cadres; but I know that the country has even more need for technical cadres." Qu Xushen from Beijing Institute of Aeronautics wrote, "I was originally a student at the Russian Language School, and recently transferred to Beijing Institute of Aeronautics to study. The school, due to a lack of cadres, transferred me to work in the Political Counseling Office. Currently, the number of university students is not even sufficient to meet the needs of national construction, and it is inappropriate for the school to randomly transfer students to participate in work like this."

    III. In the past, due to the needs of revolutionary work, engineering students from universities were transferred to work, and they have not yet been appropriately adjusted. Reader Zhang Jingyan wrote that his younger brother, Zhang Tao, was originally a student in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Shanghai Jiaotong University. After the liberation of Shanghai, due to the needs of work, he was transferred to the Shanghai Xuhui District Committee of the CCP to work as a secretary. There were seven or eight other people who were successively transferred from the school to work at the district committee. The reader believes that these people should not continue to do non-technical work and should be appropriately adjusted.

    Readers unanimously believe that before the national liberation, the liberated areas lacked a modern industrial base, and other aspects of work urgently needed a large number of revolutionary cadres. Assigning some specialized technical talent to other positions was beneficial to the revolution and therefore appropriate. However, in today's situation, which has completely changed, this situation cannot be allowed to continue. It is recommended that relevant personnel departments and education departments stop this behavior of temporarily transferring students in school to participate in work. Schools should not take advantage of this convenient condition to randomly transfer students to participate in tutoring work. For professional students who have been transferred but not rationally used, appropriate adjustments should be made.

### 机关、学校不应随意抽调大学专业学生参加工作——读者来信综述

    机关、学校不应随意抽调大学专业学生参加工作
    ——读者来信综述
    在十二月一日到七日这一周内，本报收到的有关合理使用专门技术人材的读者来信中，反映了有些机关随意抽调高等学校专业学生，做非技术性工作的不合理现象。这表现在以下几个方面：
    一、抽调高等学校学生做行政工作，天津大学吴运麟、刘维廉来信说：“去年年底，天津大学一部分学冶金、电机、水利、化工的同学，被某些单位调去做别的工作（详细情况不太了解，听说是去做公安工作）。他们有的已学了专门技术两三年。我们认为这是浪费国家人材的行为。希望把他们调回到工业建设的岗位上去，或送回学校继续学习。”
    二、抽调学生参加辅导工作：读者唐佐梁来信说：“我原是西北工学院电机系的学生。应该是去年七月毕业的；但在去年三月，就被校方调出作政治助教工作。人民日报号召合理使用专门技术人材以后，我想我应该回到技术工作岗位上去。我不是不考虑学校目前缺乏干部的情况的；但我知道，国家还有更需要技术干部的地方。”北京航空工业学院区煦燊来信说：“我本是俄语专门学校的学生，最近转到北京航空工业学院学习。校方因为缺少干部，将我调到政治辅导处工作。目前高等学校的学生还不足国家建设的需要，校方这样随便抽调学生参加工作，是不妥当的。”
    三、过去因革命工作需要，调去工作的高等学校工科学生，现仍未作适当调整。读者张敬燕来信，说他弟弟张涛，原是上海交通大学机械工程系的学生。上海解放后，由于工作的需要，被调到中共上海徐汇区委员会做秘书工作。由该校陆续调到该区委会工作的还有七、八人。读者认为不应继续让这些人做非技术工作，应适当调整。
    读者一致认为：在全国解放以前，解放区还缺乏现代工业基础，而其他方面的工作，又迫切需要大批的革命干部的情况下，把若干专门技术人材，分配到其他岗位上去工作，是对革命有利的，因此也是适当的。但是在历史情况已经完全改变了的今天，这种情况是不容许继续存在的。建议有关人事部门、教育部门，制止这种临时抽调在校学生参加工作的行为。校方更不应利用这一方便条件，随意抽调学生参加辅导工作。对于已经被抽调而未合理使用的专业学生，则应作适当调整。
