    Hungarian Musician Zoltán Kodály

    At 7:00 PM on November 17, 1951, in the backstage dressing room of the Hungarian National Opera House in Budapest, a gathering of artists participating in the opening ceremony of the first Hungarian Music Week took place. Among them were renowned Hungarian music theorists, composers, famous conductors, writers, artists, and music representatives from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries. They were engaged in lively discussions when they were drawn to an elderly man entering from outside, a figure of great seriousness, composure, and scholarly demeanor. Everyone gazed at him with utmost respect and warmly shook his hand, with the foreign representatives expressing their heartfelt greetings. I observed a prominent young Hungarian conductor and a female singer conversing jovially with this elder, laughing freely as if they were children with their father. This respected figure was none other than one of the greatest figures in contemporary Hungarian cultural life, an outstanding master in 20th-century music history, a scholar devoted to the study of folk music, a two-time Kossuth Prize winner, honorary chairman of the Hungarian Musicians' Union, and renowned composer Zoltán Kodály. When he announced the opening on behalf of the presidium, he succinctly stated: "...Hungarian composers come from the people, and their new works should be submitted to the people for review. This is the meaning of Music Week." His words elicited an extremely enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. The chairman of the Hungarian Musicians' Union, music science theorist Szabolcsi, reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying: "...Our new music was at a low ebb in the past. Forty-five years ago, Kodály began to create a new musical language, one that is of the people, familiar to the people, and readily accepted by the people. In the past, only a few people in Hungary fought for this new musical language, but today, the People's Hungary has better possibilities and conditions to develop this new musical language, and we are able to achieve more perfect results..." Indeed, the new musical language of the Hungarian people, exemplified by Kodály's many years of dedicated achievements, has now been widely developed.
    Kodály is seventy years old this year, and nearly half a century of his life has been spent in the indomitable struggle against the Hungarian feudal forces and the atrocities of Horthy fascism. Since the liberation of Hungary in 1945, the creative vitality of this elderly composer has become even more vigorous, reaching what can be considered the most complete stage of his life's work. Three of his new works were performed at this Music Week, earning unanimous praise from the conference and high evaluation. These three works are: the folk tale song "Kádár Kata" adapted for large orchestra and soloists, the choral piece "Kálló Double Dance" written for the young Hungarian National People's Art Ensemble choir, and the "Honvéd Soldier March" written for brass band. Each performance was met with sustained and enthusiastic applause from the audience. When the Hungarian National People's Art Ensemble choir sang "Kálló Double Dance," the entire audience enthusiastically applauded Kodály, who was seated in a box. He stood up several times to express his thanks, but the applause continued unabated. The head of the Soviet delegation to the conference, Stalin Prize winner, General Secretary of the Soviet Composers' Union, and renowned composer Khrennikov, said: "Kodály's processing of folk songs has grasped the characteristics of folk music—depth, clarity, and precision. It is very successful to create perfect musical forms using folk music. His works give the people infinite power, and he vividly, happily, and enthusiastically reflects the beautiful life of the Hungarian people in his music. His highly natural and concise style, the purity of his expressive techniques, and his unique and profound knowledge of choral and orchestral music place his works in the ranks of exemplary music. Today, Hungarian composers are very fortunate to live and work with this outstanding master."
    It is with such love and respect that the Hungarian working people and progressive artists all over the world are watching Kodály's brilliant life, career, and future work. Kodály's activities today demonstrate his outstanding optimism and youthful vitality. He participates in the artistic cause of building socialist Hungary, and he also contributes his creative activities to the sacred struggle to defend world peace.
    Kodály was born on December 16, 1882, in Kecskemét, Hungary, into a railway worker's family. He studied in Nagyszombat and later at the Budapest Academy of Music. In 1907, he became a teacher at the academy. During his years at the academy, he met the famous Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. From that time on, especially after his first trip with Bartók to collect Hungarian folk songs, he began an unwavering struggle for the development of folk art. Kodály's first roaming to collect folk songs and his deep immersion in the activities of the people immediately became inseparably linked to the creative career of this artist. Kodály and Bartók's work at that time was to create a new Hungarian musical language based on folk songs, a point that is no longer doubted today. This art marks a new era in progressive music history, expressing trust in the power of the working people and unwavering confidence in victory. At that time, the Hungarian peasant revolutionary movement was rising, and reactionary oppression was intensifying. The fact that Kodály went to the peasants and the poor to collect folk songs clearly meant that he was standing on the side of progress, indicating from the beginning of his career that he had decided to dedicate his life to the working people.
    He became a fighter who instigated the bourgeois democratic revolution. The importance of the beginning of folk song collection work in music history is inseparable from his political nature, and the political background precisely illustrates his historical value in music. The work of collecting folk songs itself contains a truth, that is, the great Hungarian revolutionary poet Petőfi once elucidated in a letter to his contemporary outstanding poet János Arany: "When the people win in literature, then the day they win politically is not far away." In 1905, Kodály and his comrade-in-arms Béla Bartók began the battle on the music and art front, fighting until liberation. What was his situation at that time? Kodály has the best explanation in the preface to "Children's Songs and Games": Since Bartók's departure, Kodály continued to work, sorting and classifying the thousands of songs he had collected over forty years. And after June 1942, his work became "automatic" work. That is to say, in the end, no one supported him at all. The factors in the field of folk music that inspired the people to victory, the ideal to which Kodály, Bartók, and later several students devoted themselves, were what the semi-colonial Hungary of the Habsburg dynasty and the fascist Hungary of the Horthy counter-revolution were determined to stifle. Although the reactionary rulers tried everything possible to prevent Kodály from continuing this "rebellious" work, his courage and conviction could not be thwarted; as he himself said, he continued his work "automatically" alone, for the future that he firmly believed would eventually arrive. His ideal was realized. At the same time as the first Hungarian Music Week, the first collection of Hungarian folk songs, "Children's Songs and Games," with a length of more than a thousand pages and containing one thousand one hundred and sixty-one songs, was published. This is the beginning of the widespread dissemination of the results of Bartók and Kodály's fifty years of painstaking research. The Hungarian folk song collection has more than 20,000 songs, all collected by these two great musicians and their several enthusiastic students. It is a treasure of Hungarian folk music. This publication signifies the completion of a huge work, a huge work that was started as early as 1832 by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in the preparatory stage of the "Freedom Struggle" (1848-1849), but it was only today that it was realized in the Hungary of the liberated people. The Hungarian government and people attach great importance to this event, and for this reason, the Kossuth Prize, named after Kossuth, the hero who fought for freedom in the 19th century, was awarded to him. This "Kossuth" Prize is specially established for those who are most outstanding in art, science, and socialist construction.
    Kodály's love for the working people and the new society can be seen in many of his talks. In 1937, when Horthy fascism was becoming increasingly rampant, Kodály once said: "The time has come for the cultural heritage that the intelligentsia has taken from the people and endowed with new artistic forms to be returned to the masses." In 1950, after watching the performance of his opera "Székely Spinning Room" in Debrecen, he made the following remarks to the press: "This performance was very good, and it made me very happy. I feel that there is a close connection between the stage and the audience. This is because the vast majority of the audience are workers and factory laborers...In the twenty years since 'Székely Spinning Room' was first performed, I have never encountered an audience that can so thoroughly understand the meaning and content of this work. The people shout out their voices through 'Székely Spinning Room,' and this voice must be understood by the people. The tens of thousands of workers in Debrecen have proved that we have reached this point."
    Kodály finally tasted the joy of liberation. In this tried and tested artist, the will to create was revived. Now he draws conclusions from his life's research work and compiles the large number of folk songs he has collected. At the same time, he also contributes new creations to the people. His award-winning choral piece "Kálló Double Dance"—a narrative poem depicting the liberated Hungarian people—is one of his new works. This choral piece expresses the brave, unrestrained, and enthusiastic temperament of the Hungarian people, and the people's inexhaustible creative talents.
    In congratulating Kodály on his seventieth birthday, we once again wish him eternal health.

    匈牙利音乐家佐尔丹·柯达伊
    任虹
    一九五一年十一月十七日晚七时，在匈牙利首都布达佩斯国家歌剧院后台休息室里，聚集着参加匈牙利第一届音乐周开幕典礼的许多艺术家们：有匈牙利著名的音乐理论家，作曲家，名指挥，文学家，美术家和苏联及各人民民主国家的音乐代表。他们正在热烈地畅谈，突然被一位从门外进来的、很严肃、沉静而有学者风度的长者吸引住了。大家都以十分尊敬的眼光注视着他，并和他热情地握手，各国代表也向他表示了亲切的慰问。我看到一位匈牙利著名的青年指挥和一位女歌手，在这位长者面前愉快地谈着什么，他们彼此毫无顾忌地笑了起来，有如子女和父亲一样地亲切。这位受着大家尊敬的长者就是匈牙利当代文化生活中最伟大的人物之一，是二十世纪音乐史中卓越的大师，热心研究民间音乐的学者，两次柯树特奖金的获得者，匈牙利音乐家联盟名誉主席，著名作曲家佐尔丹·柯达伊。他代表主席团宣布开幕时，很简明地说明：“……匈牙利的作曲家们是从人民中来的，他们的新作品应该交给人民来审查，这就是音乐周的意义”。他的话引起了全场极其热烈的掌声。匈牙利音乐家联盟主席，音乐科学理论家萨波奇报告开会目的时说：“……我们的新音乐过去是一个低潮，在四十五年以前柯达伊开始创作一种新的音乐语言，这种语言是人民的，是人民所熟悉所乐于接受的。匈牙利在过去只有少数几个人为这新的音乐语言而奋斗，但在今天人民的匈牙利已经有了更好的可能与条件来发展这种新的音乐语言，我们是能够得到更完美的效果的……”。的确，以柯达伊多年努力的光辉成就为榜样的匈牙利人民的新音乐语言现在已得到广泛发展了。
    柯达伊今年七十岁了，在他这一生中几乎有半个世纪是在反抗匈牙利封建势力和霍尔第法西斯主义暴行的不屈不挠斗争中度过的。从一九四五年匈牙利解放以后，这位老年作曲家的创作生命力更加旺盛起来，在他毕生事业中可算是达到了最完满的地步。在这个音乐周中演出了他的三个新作品，博得大会的一致赞美，获得很高的评价。这三个作品是：为大管弦乐队及独唱而改编的民间故事歌“卡达尔·卡塔”、为年青的匈牙利国家人民文工团合唱队所写的合唱曲“考拉双人舞”、以及为铜管乐队所写的“洪维德士兵进行曲”。每次演出都博得听众经久不息的热烈掌声。匈牙利国家人民文工团合唱队演唱“考拉双人舞”的时候，全场听众热烈地向坐在包厢中的柯达伊鼓掌。他几次站立起来致谢都停止不住掌声。参加大会的苏联代表团团长、斯大林奖金获得者、苏联作曲家协会总书记、著名作曲家赫连尼科夫说道：“柯达伊的民歌加工掌握了民间音乐的特性——深刻，明确，清楚。用民间音乐作成完美的音乐形式是非常成功的，他的作品给人民以无限的力量，他把匈牙利人民美好的生活，生动、愉快而热烈地反映在他的曲子里。他所使用的高度的自然而简洁的风格，他的表现手法的纯正以及他独特具有的关于合唱和管弦乐的渊博的知识，使他的作品列入典范音乐之林。今天匈牙利的作曲家们有机会和这位卓越的大师生活在一起，工作在一起，真是非常幸运。”
    匈牙利劳动人民和全世界进步的艺术家们，就是怀着这样的热爱和敬意在注视着柯达伊辉煌的生平事业和未来工作的。柯达伊今天的活动，显示了他突出的乐观情调和青春的活力，他参加了为建设社会主义匈牙利而进行的艺术事业，他也以自己的创作活动贡献给保卫世界和平的神圣斗争。
    柯达伊在一八八二年十二月十六日生于匈牙利科斯科美特一个铁路职工的家庭里，曾经在拉吉卓巴斯里地方求学，以后又到布达佩斯音乐专科学校学习，一九○七年他成了该校的教师，在音乐专科学校的年代中，他认识了匈牙利著名作曲家贝拉·巴尔多克。从那时候起，尤其是与巴尔多克做了第一次搜集匈牙利民歌的旅行以后，他为着民间艺术的发展，开始了坚持不渝的斗争。柯达伊首次搜集民歌的漫游，他的深入民间的活动，立即和这位艺术家的创造事业不可分地结合在一起了。柯达伊和巴尔多克当时的工作就是创造一种以民歌为基础的新匈牙利音乐语言，这一点到今天是不再被怀疑了。这种艺术在进步的音乐史上标志着一个新的时代，表现了对于劳动人民的力量的信任和坚信不疑的胜利信心。当时正是匈牙利农民革命运动日益高涨，而反动压迫随之加深的年代。柯达伊到农民和贫民间去搜集民歌的这一事实，明显地意味着他是站在进步的方面，表示了从他的事业开始时起，就已经决定把他自己的生命献给劳动人民了。
    他成了一个策动资产阶级民主革命的战斗者。民歌搜集工作的开端在音乐史上所占有的重要性是和他的政治性分不开的，而政治背景又恰恰说明了他在音乐方面的历史价值。搜集民歌这件工作的本身包含着一个真理，那就是伟大的匈牙利革命诗人彼得斐，曾经在给他同时代的杰出诗人杨诺士·阿兰尼的一封信中所阐发的：“当人民在文学中获得胜利的时候，那末他们在政治上获胜的日子也就不远了”。一九○五年柯达伊和他的战友贝拉·巴尔多克开始了音乐艺术战线上的战斗，一直战斗到解放。他当时的处境是怎么样呢，柯达伊在“儿童唱游集”的自序中有着最好的说明：自从巴尔多克离去以后，柯达伊继续工作，他将四十年中所搜集的几千只曲子加以整理分类。而在一九四二年六月以后，他的工作就成为“自动”的工作了。这就是说，到最后完全没有人支持他了。民间音乐领域中那些鼓舞人民走向胜利的因素，柯达伊、巴尔多克以及后来几位学生所献身的那个理想，就是哈布斯堡王朝的半殖民地匈牙利和霍尔第反革命的法西斯匈牙利所一心一意要设法扼杀的东西。反动统治虽想尽一切办法来使柯达伊不要继续从事这种“叛逆”的工作，但他的魄力和信念是无法挫折的；正像他自己所说，他一个人“自动地”继续了他的工作，为了那个他坚决相信终将到达的将来。他的这个理想实现了，在匈牙利第一届音乐周的同时，篇幅达一千余页，内容包括一千一百六十一支曲子的匈牙利民歌集第一集“儿童唱游集”出版了，这是把巴尔多克和柯达伊五十年来苦心研究的成果加以广泛传播的开始。匈牙利民歌集共有两万多支歌曲，都是由这两位大音乐家和他们的几个热心的学生搜集起来的，它是匈牙利民间音乐的宝藏。这次出版意味着一件巨大工作的完成，这件巨大的工作早在“自由斗争”（一八四八——一八四九年）的准备阶段中，即一八三二年就由匈牙利科学院开始了，但只有在今天被解放了的人民的匈牙利才得以实现。匈牙利政府和人民很重视这件大事，为此特将以十九世纪为自由而斗争的英雄柯树特的名字命名的柯树特奖金奖给他，这个“柯树特”奖金是专为那些在艺术，科学和社会主义建设方面最出色的人物而设立的。
    柯达伊对劳动人民和新社会的热爱，可以从他许多谈话中见到。一九三七年，当霍尔第法西斯主义愈来愈猖狂的时候，柯达伊曾经这样说：“时候到了，知识阶层从人民取来而赋以新的艺术形式的文化遗产，应该交还给人民大众了。”一九五○年当他看完他的歌剧“塞克利·斯宾奈雷”在德勃莱青地方的演出回来后，他对新闻界发表如下的谈话：“这次演出很好，它使我非常高兴。我觉得在舞台和观众之间有一种紧密的联系。这是由于观众中最大多数是工人和工厂劳动者的缘故。……从‘塞克利·斯宾奈雷’第一次上演以来，二十年中我从来没有碰到过一批观众能够这样透彻地了解这个作品中的意义和内容。人民通过‘塞克利·斯宾奈雷’喊出他们的呼声，这呼声又是人民所必须理解的。这次德勃莱青地方的千万个工人就证明我们已达到了这个地步”。
    柯达伊终于尝到了解放的快乐。在这位备经考验的艺术家身上，创作的意志又复活了。现在他给自己一生的研究工作作出结论，把自己收集的大量民歌编辑起来。同时，他还以新的创作贡献给人民。他的得奖的合唱曲“考拉双人舞”——描写解放了的匈牙利人民的叙事诗，即是他的新作品之一。这首合唱曲表达了匈牙利人民勇敢、奔放、热情的气质，和人民无穷尽的创造性的才能。
    在祝贺柯达伊七十寿诞的时候，我们再一次地祝福他永远健康。
