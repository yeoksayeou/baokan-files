(Xinhua News Agency, December 15th) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China received on December 6th, from the President of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, Pearson, a full text of the resolution passed by the Seventh United Nations General Assembly on December 3, 1952, regarding the agenda item "Korea: Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," and a telegram from President of the United Nations General Assembly Pearson himself to Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China.

Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China cabled a reply to President of the United Nations General Assembly Pearson on December 14th.

The full text of the resolution on the agenda item "Korea: Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," passed by the Seventh United Nations General Assembly on December 3rd based on an Indian proposal, and the telegram to Minister Zhou Enlai from President of the United Nations General Assembly Pearson, are as follows:

To His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

I. At its 399th Plenary Meeting of December 3, 1952, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution under agenda item 16 (A)—Korea: Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. Under the terms of that resolution, which was originally initiated by the Government of India, the President of the General Assembly was requested “to transmit the following recommendations to the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China and the North Korean authorities, as a just and reasonable basis for an agreement in order to bring about and achieve an immediate cease-fire; and invite them to accept these recommendations and to report to the General Assembly as soon as possible during the current session.” In pursuance of the task entrusted to me under the terms of the resolution, I have the honor to transmit to you the full text of the resolution and to invite you to accept the recommendations contained therein.

II. I send this letter to you against the background of the casualties, suffering and destruction in Korea, which are the inevitable consequences of war, and I add my personal appeal to you to give it the most thoughtful and sympathetic consideration. When the First Committee of the General Assembly agreed by a unanimous decision to treat the Korean question as a matter of urgency, its decision reflected the tragic concern of all members of the United Nations for the war and destruction in Korea, a concern which I believe is shared by the people of the whole world, and also reflected their deep hope to end this war on terms acceptable to both sides. To this end, negotiations have been conducted at Panmunjom for sixteen months, during which time a wide measure of agreement has been reached on the terms of a ceasefire. The only remaining issue unresolved in the ceasefire negotiations is the principle and procedure for the repatriation of prisoners of war.

III. The prisoner of war issue itself is a challenge to the basic humanitarian nature shared by all mankind and urgently needs to be resolved. In the prisoner of war camps on both sides, human beings have been placed under military detention for years, while lengthy negotiations regarding their fate continue. Both sides in the Korean conflict have an inescapable moral obligation to make every possible effort to ensure that these prisoners of war are free to return home and to assist them in returning quickly.

IV. The discussions in the First Committee of the General Assembly on this matter have made clear the general agreement within the United Nations that this issue should be dealt with and the repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, relating to the treatment of prisoners of war, the principles and practices established in international law, and the relevant provisions of the draft armistice agreement. It was also generally agreed that prisoners of war should be released from the custody of the detaining state and handed over to a repatriation commission so that they could freely exercise their unquestionable right to repatriation, and that any hindrance by the detaining state to the return of any prisoner of war to his home would be inconsistent with ordinary humanitarian principles. Finally, it was generally agreed that the Geneva Convention cannot be interpreted as authorizing the detaining state to forcibly compel individual prisoners of war to return home.

V. The General Assembly resolution clearly states the above principles regarding the settlement of the prisoner of war issue, and in addition, makes specific recommendations for the repatriation mechanism. It represents the views of many governments represented in the General Assembly, and the unanimous desire of the General Assembly is to bring peace to Korea. This resolution can make this wish a reality, because by accepting it, it is possible to reach a ceasefire and bring about a complete and immediate cessation of hostilities.

VI. Furthermore, the resolution refers to the General Assembly's willingness to expedite and assist in the convening of the political conference provided for in paragraph 60 of the draft armistice agreement that the military negotiators at Panmunjom have accepted once a ceasefire comes into effect.

VII. I sincerely hope that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will accept these recommendations of the General Assembly as the basis for resolving the only remaining issue in the Panmunjom negotiations that is preventing a ceasefire from being reached. Once this issue is resolved, it will be possible to end the fighting and complete a solution for peace in Korea, which we must hope will lead to a broader solution that contributes to peace in Asia and the world.

VIII. The United Nations is determined to do everything possible to end the fighting in Korea. This is also the stated aim of the Central People's Government. This common goal can be achieved if the recommendations now submitted for your consideration are accepted in the spirit in which they were made, as I sincerely hope they will be. With this hope, I appeal to you, in my capacity as President of the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations, to accept these recommendations of the United Nations as a just and reasonable basis for an agreement that will help bring about a constructive and lasting peace in Korea.

IX. I look forward to receiving your reply to this letter as soon as possible, and I will report to the General Assembly upon receipt.

X. In accordance with the decision of the General Assembly, the full text of the resolution has also been sent to the North Korean authorities, and I have sent a similar letter to them.

XI. Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration.

Lester B. Pearson (signed), President of the General Assembly

XII. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

The General Assembly, having received the Special Report of the Unified Command of 18 October 1952 on "The Present Situation in the Military Operations and Armistice Negotiations in Korea", and other relevant reports on Korea; Noting with approval the substantial progress made at the Panmunjom negotiations towards an armistice and preliminary agreement for the cessation of fighting in Korea and for the settlement of the Korean question; Noting further that disagreement on a single remaining issue between the two sides impedes the achievement of an armistice, and that a considerable degree of agreement already exists with regard to the principles for resolving this remaining issue; Considering the continuing and immense loss of life, devastation and suffering resulting from the continuation of the fighting; Deeply conscious of the need for a speedy termination of hostilities and a peaceful settlement of the Korean question; Anxious to expedite and assist the convening of the political conference provided for in paragraph 60 of the draft armistice agreement; Affirming that the release and repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 "relating to the Treatment of Prisoners of War", the principles and practices established in international law, and the relevant provisions of the draft armistice agreement; Affirming that no force should be used against prisoners of war to prevent or compel their return home, and that they should at all times be treated humanely in accordance with the specific provisions and the general spirit of the Geneva Convention; Therefore, requests the President of the General Assembly to transmit the following recommendations to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the North Korean authorities, as a just and reasonable basis for an agreement in order to bring about and achieve an immediate ceasefire; and invites them to accept these recommendations and to report to the General Assembly as soon as possible during the current session.

Recommendations:

(1) To assist in the repatriation of all prisoners of war, a Repatriation Commission shall be established, composed of representatives of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland, which are the four States that have been agreed to form the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission mentioned in paragraph 37 of the draft armistice agreement, or representatives of four States which have not participated in the hostilities, each side nominating two States, but excluding representatives of permanent members of the Security Council.

(2) The release and repatriation of prisoners of war shall be carried out in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 "relating to the Treatment of Prisoners of War", the principles and practices established in international law, and the relevant provisions of the draft armistice agreement.

(3) No force shall be used against the prisoners of war to prevent or compel their return home, and no violence to their persons or affront to their dignity or self-respect shall be permitted in any manner or for any purpose. The Repatriation Commission and each of its members shall be entrusted with this obligation and shall at all times treat the prisoners of war humanely in accordance with the specific provisions and the general spirit of the Geneva Convention.

(4) All prisoners of war shall be released from military control and from the custody of the detaining side and shall be handed over to the Repatriation Commission at agreed numbers and at agreed exchange points in agreed demilitarized zones.

(5) Thereafter, prisoners of war shall be classified according to nationality and place of residence as recommended in the letter of 16 October from General Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Mark Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command.

(6) After classification, prisoners of war shall have the immediate freedom to return home, and all parties concerned shall assist them in making a speedy return.

(7) Each party to the conflict shall have freedom and facility to explain to the prisoners of war "depending upon that party" their rights and to inform them of any matters relating to their return home, in particular their full freedom to return, in accordance with arrangements made for the purpose by the Repatriation Commission.

(8) Red Cross teams of both sides shall assist the Repatriation Commission in its work and shall have access to the prisoners of war when they are under the temporary jurisdiction of the Repatriation Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the draft armistice agreement.

(9) Prisoners of war shall have freedom and facility to make representations and to communicate with the Repatriation Commission and with any agency or agents working under the Repatriation Commission to inform any one or all of these agencies of their wishes on any matter pertaining to themselves, in accordance with arrangements made for the purpose by the Commission.

(10) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 above, nothing herein shall be construed as derogating from the authority of the Repatriation Commission (or its authorized representatives) to exercise its legitimate functions and responsibilities for the control of the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction.

(11) The terms of this repatriation agreement and the arrangements arising therefrom shall be made known to all prisoners of war.

(12) The Repatriation Commission is authorized to call upon the parties to the conflict, their member governments, or the United Nations for such legitimate assistance as it may require in the performance of its duties and functions and in making decisions on matters within its competence.

(13) When the two sides have entered into a repatriation agreement based on these recommendations, the interpretation of that agreement shall be the responsibility of the Repatriation Commission. In the event of disagreement within the Commission, the decision shall be by majority vote. When a majority decision is not possible, an umpire agreed upon in accordance with paragraph 14 below and article 132 of the Geneva Convention of 1949, shall have the deciding vote.

(14) The Repatriation Commission shall, at its first meeting and prior to the ceasefire, endeavor to agree upon and appoint an umpire who shall be readily available to serve the Commission and shall act as its chairman unless otherwise agreed. If the Commission is unable to agree upon the appointment of an umpire within three weeks from the date of its first meeting, the matter shall be referred to the General Assembly.

(15) After the ceasefire, the Repatriation Commission shall also station umpires in the inspection teams or in other agencies charged with functions by the Commission or by the draft armistice agreement in order to expedite the completion of the return home of prisoners of war.

(16) When the Repatriation Agreement has been agreed upon by the parties concerned, and when an umpire has been appointed as provided for in paragraph 14 above, the draft armistice agreement shall be deemed to have been accepted by them unless it is modified by mutual consent. The provisions of the draft armistice agreement shall apply immediately unless modified by the repatriation agreement. The arrangements for repatriation under this agreement shall begin at the time the armistice agreement is signed.

(17) After the armistice agreement is signed, the disposition of any prisoners of war who may not have returned home in accordance with the procedures set forth in these recommendations or in other agreed procedures within ninety days shall be submitted to the political conference provided for in paragraph 60 of the draft armistice agreement, with the understanding that recommendations shall be made concerning their disposition, including a target date for the termination of their detention. After another thirty days, if any prisoners of war have not returned home in accordance with the foregoing procedures, or if their future has not been determined by the political conference, the responsibility for their upkeep and the responsibility for dealing with them thereafter shall be transferred to the United Nations. In all matters relating to them, the United Nations shall strictly adhere to international law.

    联合国大会根据印度提案通过的关于朝鲜
    问题的非法决议案及皮尔逊致周外长电文
    【新华社十五日讯】我中央人民政府外交部在十二月六日收到联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊自纽约联合国发来联合国第七届大会于一九五二年十二月三日通过的“朝鲜：联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会报告”的议程的决议案全文及联合国大会主席皮尔逊本人致我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长来电一件。
    我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长已于十二月十四日电复联合国大会主席皮尔逊。
    联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊发来联合国第七届大会十二月三日根据印度提案所通过的关于“朝鲜：联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会报告”的议程的决议案及致周恩来部长来电全文如下：北京中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来阁下阁下：
    联合国大会于一九五二年十二月三日的第三九九次全体大会上，在第十六（A）项议程下—朝鲜：联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告—，通过了一个决议案。根据那个最初由印度政府发起的决议案的条款，大会主席被请求“把下列建议送交中华人民共和国中央人民政府及北朝鲜当局，作为一个协议的公正与合理的基础，以便引致并实现一个即刻的停火；邀请它们接受这些建议，并尽速在本届大会期间向大会作报告”。为执行该决议案条款所交予我的任务，我谨转送给您决议案全文，并邀请您接受其中所包含的建议。
    二、我向您送致这个函件，是以在朝鲜的伤亡、苦难与破坏为背景的，这些都是战争的不可避免的后果，我并加上我个人的呼吁，吁请您予以最最深思与同情的考虑。当大会第一委员会以一致的决定同意把朝鲜问题作为迫切的事项来对待时，它的决定反映了联合国所有会员对于在朝鲜的战争和毁灭的悲惨的关心，这个关心我相信是全世界人民所共有的，也反映了他们深深盼望以双方都能接受的条件来结束这个战争。为了这个目的，在板门店已进行了十六个月的谈判，在其过程中，对于停战的条件已达到广泛程度的协议。在停战谈判过程中唯一尚未解决的剩余问题，将是用以遣返战俘的原则与程序。
    三、战俘问题本身，对于人类所共有的基本人道本性，是一个挑战，并迫切需要解决。在双方俘虏营中，人类被长年累月地置于军事拘留之下，而关于他们的命运的冗长的谈判则在继续中。朝鲜冲突中双方都有不可逃避的道义上的义务，来尽一切可能的努力以保证这些战俘有自由回返家乡，并协助他们迅速回返。
    四、本届大会第一委员会对于此事的讨论已说明联合国内的一般的协议，即：这个问题应予处理，战俘之遣返应按照一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约的条文、国际公法中确立的原则与惯例以及停战协定草案中有关的规定而执行。同时也一般地同意：战俘应自拘留国的收容下释放出来，交给一个遣返委员会，以便他们能自由行使其无可置疑的遣返权利，如果拘留国对于任何战俘之回返家乡作任何阻碍，那是与通常的人道原则不符的。最后，一般地同意：日内瓦公约不能被解释为授权拘留国以武力来强使个别战俘回返家乡。
    五、大会决议案清楚地说明了关于解决战俘问题的上述原则，此外，对于遣返的机构也作了具体的建议。它代表了大会中有代表的许多政府所提出的意见，而大会的一致愿望是为朝鲜带来和平。这个决议案能使这个愿望实现，因为接受了它，就有可能达成停战并使敌对行动完全并立即停止。
    六、此外，决议案提到了大会在一旦停战生效时愿加速及协助召开板门店军事谈判者所已接受的停战协定草案第六十款所规定的政治会议。
    七、我热诚希望中华人民共和国中央人民政府将接受大会的这些建议，作为解决板门店谈判中阻止达成停战的唯一剩余问题的基础。一旦这个问题解决，将有可能结束战斗并完成在朝鲜和平解决的方案，我们必须希望这将引向一个较广泛的解决，对亚洲及世界的和平有所贡献。
    八、联合国决定尽一切可能来结束在朝鲜的战斗。这也是中央人民政府所宣布的目的。这个共同的目的是能达到的，假如现在送请您考虑的这些建议，像我所热诚希望的那样，被按照它们被提出的精神而加以接受。抱有这个希望，我以联合国第七届大会主席的身份吁请您接受联合国的这些建议，作为一个协议的公正与合理的基础，这个协议将有助于在朝鲜促成建设性与持久性和平的实现。
    九、我将盼望尽速接到您对这个函件的答复，接到后我将向大会报告。
    十、按照大会的决定，决议案全文也已送交北朝鲜当局，我也送致了一个同样的函件。
    十一、阁下，请接受我最高的敬意。
    大会主席莱士特·B·皮尔逊（署名）
    十二、决议案全文如下：
    大会接到了一九五二年十月十八日联合国军关于“在朝鲜的军事行动与停战谈判的目前情况”的特别报告，以及其他关于朝鲜的有关报告；赞许地注意到板门店的谈判对于停战所取得的相当进展以及为在朝鲜终止战斗并为达成朝鲜问题的解决的初步协议；又注意到双方一个仅剩问题上的意见不一致，阻碍了停战的达成，而在解决这个剩余问题的原则方面已经存在有相当程度的协议；想到随着战斗的继续并由此而引致的继续不断和大量丧失的生命、毁坏与苦难；深深感到迅速终止敌对行为以及和平解决朝鲜问题之必要；急欲加速并协助停战协定草案第六十款所规定之政治会议之召开；肯定战俘之释放与遣返应按照一九四九年八月十二日
    “关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约”、国际公法中确立的原则与惯例以及停战协定草案中有关的规定而执行；肯定不应对战俘施用武力以阻止或使他们回返家乡，任何时候都应按日内瓦公约的具体规定与该公约的一般精神予他们以人道的待遇；因此要求大会主席把下列建议送交中华人民共和国中央人民政府及北朝鲜当局，作为一个协议的公正与合理的基础，以便引致并实现一个即刻的停火；邀请它们接受这些建议，并尽速在本届大会期间向大会作报告。
    建议：
    （一）为了协助全部战俘回返家乡，应建立一遣返委员会，由捷克、波兰、瑞典和瑞士的代表组成，这些就是已经协议组成中立国监察委员会并在停战协定草案第三十七款中所提及的四个国家，或则由未参与敌对行动的四国代表组成，每一方提名两个国家，但安全理事会常任理事国的代表除外。
    （二）战俘之释放与遣返应按照一九四九年八月十二日“关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约”、国际公法中确立的原则与惯例以及停战协定草案中有关的规定而执行。
    （三）不应对战俘施用武力以阻止或使他们回
    返家乡，不应容许以任何方式或为任何目的对他们的身体施用暴力或侮辱他们的威严或自尊。遣返委员会及其每一委员被嘱托以这个义务任何时候均应按日内瓦公约的具体规定及该公约的一般精神予战俘以人道的待遇。
    （四）全部战俘应按协议的数目，在协议的各非军事区中的各个业经协议的交换地点，从军事控制和拘留方的收容下释放出来，交给遣返委员会。
    （五）其后应立即按照朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军及中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在十月十六日致联合国军总司令克拉克将军函中所建议的，按国籍及居住地区对战俘进行分类。
    （六）分类之后，战俘应有即刻回返家乡的自由，而有关各方应协助他们迅速回返。
    （七）按照遣返委员会为此目的而作的安排，冲突中之每一方均应有自由与便利向“依附于该方”之战俘解释他们的权利，并通知战俘任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有完全的自由回返。
    （八）双方的红十字会小组应协助遣返委员会工作，并应按照停战协定草案的规定，在战俘被置于遣返委员会的临时管辖下时，与战俘接触。
    （九）按照委员会为此目的而作的安排，战俘应有自由和便利向遣返委员会及在遣返委员会下工作的机构及代理者陈述并通信，以通知任何一个或所有这些机构他们在任何有关他们自己的事项上的愿望。
    （十）虽然有上述第三节的规定，但在此遣返协定中没有什么应被解释为削弱遣返委员会（或其授权的代表）执行其合法职务及责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。
    （十一）本遣返协定的条款及由此产生的安排应使全部战俘知悉。
    （十二）遣返委员会在执行其义务与工作时，视其需要并按委员会在这方面所作的决定，有权要求冲突中各方、其各委员国之政府，或联合国各会员国给予合法协助。
    （十三）当双方已以这些建议为基础订立遣返协定，对该协定的解释应由遣返委员会负责。在委员会中如有不同意见时，应由多数决定。当多数决定不可能时，则按照下一节以及按照一九四九年日内瓦公约第一三二条而同意的一位公断人，将有决定的一票。
    （十四）遣返委员会在其第一次会议中并在停战前，应对于公断人设法取得协议并加以任命，此公断人应随时能为委员会服务，并应作为其主席，除非另有协议。假如自第一次会议之日起三星期内，委员会对于任命一名公断人不能达成协议，则此事应提交大会。
    （十五）停战后，遣返委员会也应在各视察小组中或在由委员会委托任务的或由停战协定草案规定任务的其他机构中，安置官员作为公断人，以加速完成战俘回返家乡的工作。
    （十六）当遣返协定已为有关各方所同意，当
    一名公断人已按上述第十四节而任命，则除非经双方同意后加以修改，否则停战协定草案应被认为被它们所接受。停战协定草案之规定应即适用，除非被遣返协定所修改。在此协定下，关于遣返的安排将在停战协定签订时开始。
    （十七）停战协定签订九十日后，任何可能尚未按照在这些建议中所提出的步骤或另外协议的步骤而回返家乡的战俘，其处理应提交停战协定草案第六十款所规定召开之政治会议，并附带提出关于处理之建议，包括一个终止拘留他们的目标日期。在又三十日后，假如有任何战俘，其回返家乡尚未按上述步骤执行，或其前途尚未由政治会议作出规定，则保养他们的责任以及其后处理他们的责任应转交联合国。联合国在一切有关他们的事项上，应严格按照国际公法。
