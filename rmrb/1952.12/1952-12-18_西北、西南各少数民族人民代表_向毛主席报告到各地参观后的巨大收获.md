To our beloved Chairman Mao:

We are representatives of 31 ethnic minorities from the Northwest and Southwest regions. After participating in the grand National Day celebrations for the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we organized a visiting group under the specific leadership and assistance of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government to visit Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, and other places. We visited factories, schools, hospitals, workers' new villages, temples, as well as the vast ocean and the beautiful West Lake. We personally witnessed the rapid development of various constructions in our motherland over the past three years, and deeply realized that under your wise leadership, there are no difficulties that the Chinese people of all ethnic groups cannot overcome.

All the factories we visited have restored production to, and even surpassed, pre-war levels, with countless new inventions and creations. We saw the bright future of our motherland's industrialization, and everyone jumped for joy. We further realized that without the leadership and assistance of our advanced Han brothers, the economic and cultural development of our ethnic minorities would not be possible so quickly.

What we especially need to report to you is that the warm reception and enthusiastic welcome from the Han people in various places are unforgettable for us. Sometimes, we arrived at a place late at night, but the local leaders and thousands of people still came to the station to welcome us. Whether we went to factories, schools, or shops, whether we were on the streets or in parks, we were welcomed and cared for by our Han brothers everywhere. Even three or four-year-old children greeted us affectionately with "Uncle, Grandpa" and clapped their little hands to welcome us. Comparing this to our past experience of being oppressed and humiliated by the Kuomintang's chauvinistic Han chauvinists—the running dogs of imperialism—we were moved to tears. Your great ethnic policy has been deeply implemented in every corner of the motherland. How warm our big family of friendly and cooperative ethnic groups in China is!

We also want to report to you that we saw temples that were destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past are now being repaired by the People's Government with huge sums of money, or are under construction. This makes us firmly believe that the People's Government truly protects freedom of religious belief. Some of us used to listen to rumors from bad elements and had doubts about this. After seeing the above situation during the visit, there is no longer any doubt in our minds.

Respected Chairman Mao: Do you know what we call you? We call you "Living Buddha." Because your great ethnic policy has enabled our ethnic minorities to enjoy equal rights and a happy life. We swear to you that after we return, we will widely tell the people of all ethnic groups about the enthusiastic care of the Han people in the mainland for us; and resolutely respond to your call to work hard to increase production and practice economy, and strive to the end to consolidate national defense and build our motherland!

    西北、西南各少数民族人民代表
    向毛主席报告到各地参观后的巨大收获亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是西北、西南各地区三十一个少数民族人民的代表。参加了祖国第三届国庆盛典观礼之后，我们在中央人民政府民族事务委员会的具体领导和帮助下，组织了一个参观团，到天津、上海、杭州、无锡、南京等地去参观。我们参观了工厂、学校、医院、工人新村、寺庙以及辽阔的海洋和优美的西湖。我们亲眼见到了祖国三年来各项建设的飞跃发展，深刻地体会到：在您英明领导下，中国各族人民面前没有不能克服的困难。
    所有我们参观的工厂，生产都已恢复了甚至超过了战前水平，新的发明和创造更是数不胜数。我们看到了祖国工业化的远景，大家都高兴得跳跃起来。我们进一步认识了：假如没有先进的汉族老大哥的领导和帮助，我们少数民族的经济和文化是不可能很快发展的。
    特别需要向您报告的是：各地汉族人民对我们的亲切招待和热烈欢迎，是我们永远不能忘掉的。有时，我们坐车到达一个地方时已经是深更半夜了，但当地首长和成千成百的群众还到车站来欢迎我们。我们无论到工厂、学校或商店里去，无论是在街道上或公园里，处处都受到汉族大哥的欢迎和关怀。甚至三、四岁的小娃娃见了我们都亲切地叫着伯伯、叔叔，还举两个小手拍掌欢迎。拿这些来和我们过去受帝国主义的走狗——国民党大汉族主义者的压迫和侮辱的情形对比，我们都感动得流下泪来了。您的伟大的民族政策已经深深地贯彻到祖国的每个角落。我们中国各民族友爱合作的大家庭是多么温暖！
    我们还要向您报告：我们看到过去被国民党反动派破坏的庙宇，现在人民政府已出巨款把它修复，或者正在修建。这使我们确切地相信：人民政府是真正保障宗教信仰自由的。我们中间有些人过去听信了坏分子的谣言，对这一点有怀疑。在参观时见到上述情况后心里再也没有一点怀疑了。
    敬爱的毛主席：您知道我们对您曾有一种称呼吗？我们都称呼您为“活菩萨”。因为您的伟大的民族政策，使我们各少数民族享受了平等权利，得到了幸福生活。我们向您宣誓：我们回去后一定要把内地汉族人民对我们热情关怀的情况广泛地告诉各民族人民；并且坚决响应您的号召，努力增产节约，为巩固国防、建设祖国奋斗到底！
