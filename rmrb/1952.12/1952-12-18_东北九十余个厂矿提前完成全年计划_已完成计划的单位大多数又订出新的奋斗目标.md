    Over Ninety Factories and Mines in Northeast China Complete Annual Plans Ahead of Schedule
    Most Units That Have Completed Plans Set New Goals

    Encouraged by the prospect of large-scale economic construction, over ninety factories and mines in Northeast China, including Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Steelmaking Plant and Ore Dressing Plant, Benxi Steel Plant, Shenyang Smelting Plant, Electric Engineering Plant No. 5, and Machinery Plant No. 4, have completed their annual production plans or increased production and economization plans ahead of schedule.

    The main reasons why these units were able to complete their plans ahead of schedule are as follows: First, leading cadres attach importance to state plans, earnestly mobilize workers to discuss plans, and vigorously promote and learn from advanced experiences. The completion of plans by Electric Engineering Plant No. 5 from January to July was not satisfactory. After leading cadres educated workers to value state plans, led section and workshop cadres to compile daily progress schedules, and implemented the advanced experience of organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts, the plant's production balance rate rose month by month from August, reaching 92% in October. On December 10th, it completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule, and the value of increased production and economization exceeded the original plan by more than 36,000 tons of grain. Shenyang Smelting Plant, at the beginning of the increased production and economization campaign, promptly focused on promoting advanced experience in improving the actual recovery rate and product quality. In the past, the zinc electrolysis workshop had been unable to complete its production plan for a long time. Since learning the Soviet "three-stage leaching method" and "three-time purification method," the actual recovery rate of zinc in October increased by 12%, and the quality improved from 99.8% qualified to 99.96%. The lead electrolysis workshop accepted the Soviet experts' advice on increasing the concentration of electrolytic acid and the copper removal method by adding sulfur. With the research and creation of workers and technicians, the quality of lead improved to 99.99% qualified, exceeding the original standard. The reverberatory furnace and blast furnace, following the Soviet experts' advice, implemented the rapid copper smelting method, greatly shortening the operation time, and the actual recovery rate and quality were unprecedentedly improved. The entire plant completed the annual increased production and economization plan, equivalent to 111,889 tons of grain, in early November. At the beginning of the increased production and economization campaign, Changchun Paper Mill could barely complete its daily production tasks and could not increase production. Later, it organized a visiting group to Jilin Paper Mill to learn the advanced spraying pulp method, eliminating bumps, water spots, and pinholes on the paper. It also went to Dalian Lian Zhang Paper Mill to learn the rapid pulping method, thus increasing production efficiency by nearly two times. In November, it completed its annual production plan and increased production and economization plan ahead of schedule.

    Second, through the education of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and Party consolidation studies, the class consciousness of the vast working class has been universally improved. They have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in the production competitions to welcome "May Day," "July 1st," National Day, and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Numerous tips and new records have emerged, which is also an important factor in completing the annual plan ahead of schedule. The workers of Shenyang Smelting Plant have found more than 1,200 tips in the past year. After joint research by workers and technicians, all the tips have been synthesized into thirty-three advanced operating methods, which have been promoted throughout the plant. Lin Qixiang, a technician in the True Blowing Furnace workshop, took the initiative to observe the operation methods of 263 furnace batches and summarized the "Large Airflow Slag Rapid Copper Smelting Method" based on 49 tips proposed by workers. After its promotion, the operation time per furnace was shortened from 24 hours to 14-15 hours, and the actual recovery rate increased by 2.3%. The workers of Qiqihar Railway Factory found 1,580 tips this year, which increased labor productivity to 112.4%. Due to the continuous emergence of new records at the Ore Dressing Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the operating rate of the sintering machine increased from 82% to 93%. The daily output of Ma Dianxuan's model team exceeded the highest record of the puppet Manchukuo by 450%, and the quality also increased from 53% to 59.5%. The plant, due to accepting the Soviet experts' advice, successfully trial-produced self-fluxing sintered ore with lime instead of weathered lime, which improved the quality and output and can save the country 17.4 billion yuan of wealth each year.

    Third, in the patriotic increased production and economization competition, all factories and mines paid attention to improving the material and cultural life of the workers, which inspired the workers' initiative and creativity and was also an important condition for ensuring the completion of the plan. For example, eight of the eleven welfare projects stipulated in the collective contract of the Smelting Plant were completed ahead of schedule by the end of October. Rubber Factory No. 4 had solved twelve welfare facilities by the end of November. Electric Engineering Plant No. 5 basically solved the problem of workers' dormitories. Shenyang Paint Factory built a new amateur sanatorium. Many factories have attached importance to and improved workers' working conditions and welfare.

    Fourth, it should be particularly emphasized that the correct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has a decisive effect on the completion of the production plans of various factories and mines. In July of this year, due to various reasons, the completion of production plans in some factories and mines in Northeast China was very poor. Only nine of the 45 major products of the Ministry of Industry completed their plans, and only fifteen of the 36 major products of local industry completed their plans. In view of this situation, the Northeast Bureau promptly convened an industrial symposium, listing the completion of production plans as the most central task of various factories and mines. Subsequently, it sent working groups to help various factories and mines find out the reasons for not completing the plans, formulate measures and plans, and the completion of plans gradually improved. In October, the Northeast Bureau issued instructions on completing the annual capital construction and industrial production plans in the fourth quarter, timely guiding the work of various factories and mines.

    Most of the units that have completed their plans have set new goals. For example, the workers of the Ore Dressing Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company proposed to exceed the plan by 16% by the end of the year. Qiqihar Railway Factory has added a plan to increase production and economize more than 78,000 tons of grain. The workers of Machinery Plant No. 4 have the confidence to increase production and economize 4,000 tons of grain for the country. The workers of Changchun Paper Mill are working hard to complete the additional plan of 1 billion yuan. The workers expressed that they would do a good job in various preparations to welcome next year's large-scale economic construction.

    东北九十余个厂矿提前完成全年计划
    已完成计划的单位大多数又订出新的奋斗目标
    在迎接大规模经济建设的鼓舞下，东北鞍山炼钢厂、选矿厂、本溪钢厂、沈阳冶炼厂、电工五厂、机械四厂等九十多个厂矿提前完成了全年生产计划或增产节约计划。
    这些单位所以能提前完成计划，主要原因有如下几点：一、由于领导干部重视国家计划，认真发动职工讨论计划，大力推广与学习先进经验。电工五厂一至七月份完成计划的情况并不好，经领导干部教育职工重视国家计划，带领科股和车间干部编排了日进度，推行了按指示图表组织有节奏生产先进经验之后，从八月份起，全厂生产均衡率逐月上升，到十月份已达到百分之九十二，十二月十日提前完成了全年生产计划，增产节约价值也超出原计划三万六千余吨粮食。沈阳冶炼厂在增产节约运动开始时即抓紧推广了提高实收率及产品质量的先进经验。过去锌电解车间长时期完不成生产计划，自从学习苏联“三段浸出法”和“三次净液法”，十月份锌的实收率即提高百分之十二，质量从百分之九十九点八合格提高到百分之九十九点九六。铅电解车间接受了苏联专家有关增加电解酸的浓度和加硫脱铜法的建议，加上工人、技术员的研究创造，铅质量提高到百分之九十九点九九合格，超过原订标准。反射炉和鼓风炉也因按照苏联专家的建议，实行了快速炼铜法，大大缩短了操作时间，实收率和质量空前提高。全厂在十一月初完成了相当于十一万一千八百八十九吨粮食的全年增产节约计划。长春造纸厂在增产节约运动开始时，每天刚能完成生产任务，不能增产，后组织参观团到吉林造纸厂学会了先进喷浆法，消灭了纸上的疙瘩、水点和眼子；又到大连连章造纸厂学习了快速打浆法，因而生产效率提高近两倍，十一月提前完成了全年生产计划和增产节约计划。
    二、经过“三反”“五反”运动和整党学习的教育，广大职工阶级觉悟普遍提高，他们在迎接“五一”、“七一”、国庆节、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的生产竞赛中，发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，窍门和新纪录层出不穷，这也是提前完成全年计划的重要因素。沈阳冶炼厂职工一年来找出一千二百多个窍门，经工人和技术人员共同研究，将所有窍门综合成了三十三种先进操作法，在全厂推广。真吹炉车间技术员林其相主动观察了二百六十三炉次的操作法，又根据工人提出的四十九个窍门，总结成了“大风流渣快速炼铜法”，推广以后，每炉操作时间由二十四小时缩短到十四五小时，实收率提高百分之二点三。齐齐哈尔铁路工厂的职工今年找到了一千五百八十个窍门，使劳动生产率提高到了百分之一百一十二点四。鞍山钢铁公司选矿厂由于新纪录不断出现，烧结机运转率由百分之八十二提高到了百分之九十三；马殿选模范班日产量超过伪满最高纪录百分之四百五十，质量也由百分之五十三提高到百分之五十九点五。该厂由于接受了苏联专家的建议，以石灰代替风化石灰试制自熔性烧结矿成功，提高了质量、产量，每年并能给国家节省一百七十四亿元的财富。
    三、各厂矿在爱国增产节约竞赛中，注意改善工人物质文化生活，鼓舞了工人的积极性与创造性，也是保证计划完成的重要条件。如冶炼厂集体合同中签订的十一项福利事业，至十月底即提前完成了八项；橡胶四厂到十一月末已解决了十二项福利设施；电工五厂基本上解决了职工宿舍问题；沈阳油漆厂新建了业余疗养所。许多工厂都重视并改进了工人劳动条件与生活福利。
    四、应特别着重指出的是：中共中央东北局的正确领导，对各厂矿生产计划的完成有决定性的作用。今年七月份，由于种种原因，东北某些厂矿生产计划完成情况很不好，工业部四十五种主要产品只有九种完成计划；地方工业三十六种主要产品中只有十五种完成计划。根据这一情况，东北局及时召开了工业座谈会，把完成生产计划列为各厂矿最中心的任务；随后又派出工作组帮助各厂矿找出完不成计划的原因，订出措施计划，完成计划情况逐渐好转。十月份，东北局又发出了关于第四季度内完成全年基本建设与工业生产计划的指示，及时地指导了各厂矿的工作。
    已完成计划的单位，大多数又订出了新的奋斗目标。如鞍山钢铁公司选矿厂的职工提出到年底超过计划百分之十六；齐齐哈尔铁路工厂又增订了增产节约七万八千多吨粮食的计划；机械四厂的职工有信心再为国家增产节约四千吨粮食的财富；长春造纸厂的职工正在为完成十亿元的追加计划而努力。职工们表示要做好各项准备工作，迎接明年大规模经济建设。
