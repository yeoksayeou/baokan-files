    [This newspaper dispatch] The National Bureau of Statistics convened a national statistics work conference in Beijing from December 15th to December 23rd, and determined the "1953 National Statistical Work Program" and drafted the "General Rules for the Organization of Statistical Agencies at All Levels." Participants in the meeting included: heads of statistical sections (or statistical bureaus, statistical sections) from 36 units of the central commissions, ministries, administrations, and banks, as well as heads of statistical bureaus (or statistical sections) from major administrative regions, 28 provinces (excluding Xinjiang and Xikang), and 18 large cities, totaling 128 people.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Xue Muqiao, Director of the National Bureau of Statistics, delivered an opening speech. He first analyzed the current economic situation of the country and explained the urgent demands of the state for statistical work on the eve of large-scale, planned economic and cultural construction. He pointed out that without correct and complete statistics, it would be impossible to formulate correct and complete economic and cultural construction plans; without timely statistical accounting, it would be impossible to check the implementation of the plan in a timely manner. At the same time, he emphasized that our statistical work must learn from the Soviet Union. Director Xue Muqiao made an appropriate evaluation of the statistical work in the past three years, focusing on pointing out many shortcomings in the past statistical work. These shortcomings are mainly manifested in: many of the past survey and statistical works were carried out in a decentralized manner by various regions and departments. Due to the different objects, scopes, classification methods, form indicators, and specific contents of the same indicators in survey statistics, the statistical data of various regions and departments cannot be integrated or compared with each other. Therefore, not only did great duplication and waste occur in the work, but also great confusion arose, causing many unsolvable problems. This is mainly because our survey and statistical work lacks scientific organization and leadership, because many regions lack sound statistical agencies, and because there is a lack of regular statistical systems and scientific survey and statistical methods. In order to overcome these shortcomings, Director Xue Muqiao pointed out that we must adopt the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, concentrate and unify the national survey and statistical work by the National Bureau of Statistics, establish and improve statistical agencies at all levels, and establish a complete and scientific statistical accounting system.

    In their speeches, the attendees also unanimously agreed that in order to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, it is necessary to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and establish a scientific statistical system under the principle of centralized unity. After discussion, the attendees also clearly recognized that the main task of statistical work is to provide the leading organs with the statistical data necessary for formulating plans and deciding policies, and to check the completion of the plan through statistical data. The attendees also reflected the serious phenomenon of indiscriminate issuing of forms in various regions and departments, and unanimously agreed that it must be improved immediately. In the future, when local governments and various business departments issue survey forms or statistical forms, they must go through certain approval procedures; the economic statistics needed by party and government organs at all levels should be provided by the statistical agencies and do not need to be investigated by themselves; in addition, in order to ensure the completion of the basic national statistical tasks, the statistical agencies must establish regular statistical systems and statistical work; the statistical data required by party and government organs should be notified to the statistical agencies in advance and included in the statistical work plan.

    The meeting carefully discussed the 1953 National Statistical Work Program, and studied in detail the work plan and reporting outline formulated by the National Bureau of Statistics. Many specific issues regarding work plans and methods were also resolved satisfactorily. The meeting also discussed the organizational structures, staffing, and cadre training plans at all levels in light of the fact that the statistical work tasks are heavy and the existing statistical force is weak. In terms of cadre training, it was unanimously agreed that central ministries, major administrative regions, and provinces and cities need to set up short-term training classes to train statistical cadres, and special attention should be paid to business learning in daily work. The meeting also organized typical reports of work experience from various places to exchange work experience.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government made important instructions to the attendees on December 22nd. He pointed out that from next year we will begin large-scale economic construction. To carry out large-scale economic construction, we must formulate correct plans. Statistical work is the foundation of planning. To formulate correct economic plans, we must have correct statistics. Therefore, establishing and improving statistical work has become an important task, and any neglect of statistical work is wrong. Statistical work departments must not only provide statistical data to the leading organs, but also be responsible for supervising and checking the completion of various plans. Although our current capabilities are weak and we cannot shoulder such a heavy responsibility, we still need to move in this direction. Therefore, leading comrades of party and government at all levels and leading comrades of enterprises must attach importance to statistical work, regard strengthening statistical work as their own responsibility, and recognize that this is an important task related to national construction. He also hoped that all statistical cadres would work hard to overcome difficulties, earnestly study their business, and complete the glorious task of statistical work.

    Before the end of the meeting, Director Xue Muqiao made a summary report. In his report, he conveyed the instructions of Vice Chairman Gao Gang of the Central People's Government. In his report, he pointed out that our country's construction has priorities, so statistical work must also have priorities. In terms of work requirements, he particularly emphasized the consistency between national statistical tasks and local statistical tasks. Some places do not have a clear understanding of the basic tasks of the national statistical agencies, and often assign the professional statistical work that should be done by the business departments to the national statistical agencies; some places even use the statistical departments as mobile units for shock work. All these incorrect understandings must be reversed in order to ensure the completion of the national statistical tasks. Regarding the issue of strengthening the institutions and allocating cadres, he pointed out that the statistical institutions of provinces and cities should be strengthened in the first quarter of next year, and attention must be paid to the quality of cadres when allocating cadres. At the same time, the statistical data of the national statistical agencies mainly rely on the supply of various business departments, so it is extremely important to strengthen the statistical work of various business systems. He also requested that the statistical work of various ministries, administrations, enterprises, and various departments and bureaus of provinces and cities under the central government should be strengthened quickly and practically.

    The meeting also invited Soviet experts to make two special reports. The Soviet experts answered the important questions raised.

    国家统计局召开全国统计工作会议
    确定一九五三年统计工作纲要
    朱德副主席到会作了重要指示
    【本报讯】国家统计局于十二月十五日至十二月二十三日，在北京召开了全国统计工作会议，确定了“一九五三年全国统计工作纲要”和拟订了“各级统计机构组织通则”。参加这次会议的有：中央各委、部、署、行三十六个单位的统计处（或统计局、统计科）负责人及各大行政区、二十八个省（新疆、西康未到）、十八个大城市统计局（或统计处）负责人等共一百二十八人。
    会议开始时，国家统计局局长薛暮桥致开幕词。他首先分析了目前国家的经济情况，说明了国家在大规模的、有计划的经济、文化建设的前夕对于统计工作的迫切要求。他指出：如果没有正确的、完全的统计数字，便不可能制订正确的、完全的经济文化建设计划；如果没有及时的统计核算，便不能及时检查计划的执行情况。同时，他强调指出，我们的统计工作，必须向苏联学习。对于过去三年的统计工作，薛暮桥局长作了适当的评价，着重地指出了过去统计工作方面的许多缺点。这些缺点主要表现在：过去的许多调查统计工作是由各地区、各部门分散进行的，由于调查统计的对象不同、范围不同、分类方法不同、表式指标不同和同一指标的具体内容不同，各地区各部门的统计资料不能综合，也不能互相比较。因此，工作上不但发生了极大的重复和浪费的现象，而且产生了极大的混乱，引起了许多无法解决的问题。这主要是由于我们的调查统计工作缺乏科学的组织和领导，由于许多地区缺乏健全的统计机构以及缺乏经常的统计制度与科学的调查统计方法。为了克服这些缺点，薛暮桥局长指出，我们必须采用苏联先进经验，由国家统计局集中统一领导全国调查统计工作，建立并健全各级统计机构和建立一套完整的、科学的统计核算制度。
    到会人员在发言中，也一致认为为了适应大规模的经济建设的需要，必须学习苏联先进经验，在集中统一的原则下建立科学的统计制度。经过讨论，到会人员并明确地认识到统计工作的主要任务，是向领导机关提供编制计划和决定政策所必需的统计资料，并通过统计资料来检查计划的完成情况。到会人员也反映了目前各地区各部门滥发表格的严重现象，一致认为必须立即改进。今后，各地政府与各业务部门颁发调查表格或统计表格时，必须经过一定的批准手续；各级党政机关所需要的经济统计资料，应由统计机构供给，不必自行调查；此外，为了保证完成国家基本统计任务，统计机构必须建立经常的统计制度和统计工作；党政机关必需的统计资料，应先通知统计机构列入统计工作计划。
    会议认真地讨论了一九五三年全国统计工作纲要，详细地研究了国家统计局所制订的工作计划与报表纲目。关于工作计划和工作方法上的许多具体问题，也获得了完满的解决。会议还针对统计工作任务重大，而现有统计力量薄弱的实况，讨论了各级组织机构与编制和干部培养计划。在培养干部方面，一致认为中央各部及各大行政区各省市，都需要设立培养统计干部的短期训练班，特别要抓紧进行日常工作中的业务学习。会议并组织了各地工作经验的典型报告，交流工作经验。
    中央人民政府副主席朱德曾于十二月二十二日向到会人员作了重要指示。他指出：从明年起我们将开始大规模的经济建设，要进行大规模的经济建设，就必须编制正确的计划。统计工作是计划的基础。要编制正确的经济计划，就必须有正确的统计。因此，建立和健全统计工作已成为重要任务，任何对统计工作不加重视，都是错误的。统计工作部门不但要向领导机关提供统计资料，而且要负责监督检查各种计划的完成状况。虽然，我们目前能力薄弱，还担负不了这样大的责任，但仍需要朝这个方向前进。因此各级党政负责同志，各企业领导同志，必须重视统计工作，把加强统计工作当作自己的责任，认识这是有关国家建设的重要任务。并希望所有统计干部努力克服困难，认真钻研业务，来完成统计工作的光荣任务。
    会议结束前，薛暮桥局长作了总结报告。他在报告中传达了中央人民政府副主席高岗的指示。在报告中，他指出我们国家的建设是有重点的，因此统计工作也要有重点。在工作要求上，他特别强调了国家的统计任务和地方统计任务的一致性。有些地方对国家统计机构的基本任务认识不明确，往往把业务部门应作的专业统计工作，交给国家统计机构去负担；更有些地方把统计部门当作机动部队突击使用。所有这些不正确的认识，必须扭转过来，才能保证国家统计任务的完成。关于充实机构与配备干部的问题，他指出：在明年第一季中要把省市统计机构充实起来，配备干部必须注意干部的质量。同时，国家统计机关的统计资料，主要依靠各业务部门供给，所以加强各业务系统的统计工作也极为重要。他并要求中央各部，各管理局、各企业以及各省市各厅局的统计工作都要迅速地切实地加强起来。
    会议还邀请苏联专家作了两次专题报告。苏联专家对提出的重要问题作了解答。
