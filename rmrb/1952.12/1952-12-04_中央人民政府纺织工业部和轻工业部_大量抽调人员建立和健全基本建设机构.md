　　The Central People's Government's Ministry of Textile Industry and Ministry of Light Industry
    Vigorously Transfer Personnel to Establish and Improve Basic Construction Organizations
    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Textile Industry and Ministry of Light Industry are vigorously transferring cadres and technical personnel to establish and improve basic construction organizations, and are systematically training and cultivating various basic construction talents.
    Since the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Commission's Basic Construction Conference, the Ministry of Textile Industry immediately convened a meeting of the directors of various textile administration bureaus and persons in charge of various basic construction areas. At the meeting, Director Chen Yun's instruction "We must put the focus of leadership on basic construction work" was conveyed and discussed, and specific preparations were arranged:
    In order to establish and improve various basic construction organizations, the ministry has reorganized and expanded the Engineering Department into a Basic Construction Bureau. Currently, 135 cadres have been concentrated, and 355 more will be transferred successively within the year. In addition to the design, engineering, finance, material supply, and machinery manufacturing departments, the Basic Construction Bureau has also established enterprise-based design, civil engineering, and installation companies. As of the end of November, the design company had more than 100 designers, and 200 more can be assembled within the year. The civil engineering company and engineering team are composed of construction technicians concentrated from factories under the jurisdiction of various bureaus, and plans are in place to organize 7,800 fixed technical workers in various places, who will receive political and technical training this winter and spring. At present, 5,400 fixed workers have been organized in Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South, and Handan, and four civil engineering companies have been formed separately. Civil engineering companies in other regions are also being organized. The installation company of the Ministry of Textile Industry will be formally established in the second quarter of next year. The installation team will be composed of maintenance workers drawn from factories under the jurisdiction of various textile administration bureaus. Currently, 500 people have been drawn from East China and have begun training. The basic construction organizations of various local textile administration bureaus are also being established and further strengthened. The Northeast, Qingdao, and Shanghai bureaus have all established basic construction offices. Handan has established the North China Textile Administration Bureau's basic construction office, and Zhengzhou has assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for basic construction work. The Northwest and Central South, which originally had basic construction offices, have added new cadres and strengthened their forces. Construction committees have been established in various new factory areas, and key leading cadres have been assigned.
    In order to continuously expand the reserve force, the Ministry of Textile Industry and its affiliated bureaus have begun to transfer and recruit various personnel, and are systematically conducting training and cultivation separately. Among them, the trainees of the surveying personnel training class held in Beijing can participate in the re-measurement, surveying, drilling, and testing of new factory projects this winter and spring. Before construction begins in various places, it is planned to open training classes for civil engineering, water supply and drainage, heating and sanitation, electrical lighting, and boiler construction personnel, as well as training classes for technicians to promote advanced working methods.
    In order to carry out design work correctly and quickly, from the end of September to the beginning of October, the ministry dispatched two surveying teams to new factory areas to cooperate with local construction committees to carry out engineering geological surveys. The standard design plan for new factories next year has been preliminarily drafted, the machine layout diagram has been completed, and the preliminary design of one factory has begun. In order to overcome the difficulty of a lack of design personnel and complete the task on schedule, it has been decided to unify the standards for new factories, design two types of factory buildings according to the north-south climate conditions, and then make appropriate modifications according to the specific conditions of each place, striving to complete all design tasks before April next year.
    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry is also seizing the time to prepare for basic construction next year. The total investment in light industry basic construction in 1953 will exceed the total investment in the previous three years. In order to complete the arduous basic construction tasks next year, the Ministry of Light Industry held a national light industry basic construction conference from November 13th to 19th. The conference summarized and exchanged the experiences of basic construction in various places, determined the basic construction tasks and control figures for various regions in 1953, and formulated specific methods for organizing basic construction forces. The Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has now been established. In order to strengthen the design force, the Ministry of Light Industry has established not only a comprehensive design institution, but also three professional design institutions for papermaking, sugar making, and pharmaceuticals. Regions with the necessary conditions will establish professional or comprehensive design institutions under the unified leadership of the ministry. The design institution of the Papermaking Industry Administration Bureau has transferred more than 30 technicians from various directly affiliated factories. In terms of construction forces, the Northeast Light Industry Administration Bureau's Construction Engineering Company plans to have 3,000 fixed technicians. The North China and Southwest Light Industry Administration Bureaus and the Guangdong Paper Mill and Sugar Industry Company will separately establish construction engineering companies and construction engineering teams. Papermaking, pharmaceutical, and sugar industries will separately organize and cultivate installation engineering teams. In order to accelerate the training of cadres, the Ministry of Light Industry has decided to vigorously prepare for and expand various secondary technical schools. The Tianjin Papermaking Industry Training Class has been expanded into the Tianjin Papermaking Industry School, and the number of students will increase to 250 next year. The Jilin Papermaking Technician School plans to train 300 papermaking technicians. The Guangdong Sugar Industry Training Class is planned to be expanded into a sugar industry school. The Northeast has established a sugar making technician training class, which plans to train 288 technicians next year. The Northeast Papermaking Rubber Training Class has been expanded into a light industry technical school. The Southwest Light Industry Administration Bureau has decided to establish a cadre training class, first to train 100 engineering and technical personnel and 100 accounting planning and statistical personnel needed for basic construction. In addition, the ministry has decided to add new departments such as electrical engineering to the Shanghai Zhonghua Vocational School under its jurisdiction, and is preparing to build a chemical industry school in Beijing.
