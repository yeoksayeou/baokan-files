    Soviet Expert Helps Correct Design Errors in a Tianlan Railway Station, Saving the Nation 4.8 Trillion Yuan in Property

    While inspecting the Tianlan Railway, Soviet expert Comrade Zubkov corrected a design error in a railway station, preventing a loss of 4.8 trillion yuan. An engineer from the Railway Ministry's Design Bureau was responsible for designing the Beidaobu station on the Tianlan Railway. He believed that Beidaobu station was too small, with a river in front and mountains behind. Therefore, he wanted to build the station on the opposite bank of the Beidaobu River, at Mapaquan. He had seen a Canadian "Engineering Monthly" with new station design features, so he asked the surveying team to survey dozens of kilometers of land near Mapaquan, designing the Mapaquan station to be one kilometer wide and more than six kilometers long. This station would have fully mechanized equipment, including both double-hump and single-hump marshalling yards. In terms of equipment, it would indeed be the largest station China had ever seen.

    After the station design was completed, another engineer from the Design Bureau thought it was too large and unnecessary for current needs. However, the engineer who designed the station said, "How do you know it's unnecessary? When we build communism in the future, the Tianlan Railway will develop into three or four lines!"

    Although the station design was very elaborate, it had many serious technical errors. After Soviet expert Comrade Zubkov investigated the site, he pointed out the errors in the station design: trains entering and leaving the station would have to travel more than twelve kilometers of curved track; an additional Wei River bridge of more than three hundred meters would have to be built; an additional sand prevention ditch would have to be constructed; more than eight thousand mu of fertile land would be occupied; and several orchards would be destroyed. Comrade Zubkov believed that since the Beidaobu station already existed, it only needed to be slightly renovated to meet the needs, and there was no need to build the Mapaquan station.

    The leadership of the Railway Ministry accepted Comrade Zubkov's suggestion and decided to continue using the original Beidaobu station. According to the estimate of the Station and Yard Section of the Railway Ministry's Design Bureau, Comrade Zubkov's suggestion saved the country 4.8 trillion yuan in property, which is enough to buy three hundred and twenty fighter planes.

    苏联专家帮助改正天兰铁路一个车站设计工作的错误
    使我国家财产避免了四千八百亿元的损失
    苏联专家祖布可夫同志在检查天兰铁路工作时，纠正了一个车站设计工作的错误，避免了四千八百亿元的损失。铁道部设计局的一位工程师负责设计天兰铁路北道埠车站。他认为北道埠车站前面是河，后面是山，地方太小，因此他就要把车站建筑在北道埠的对岸马跑泉。他曾看到一本加拿大的“工程月刊”，里面有些车站设计的新花样，于是他就要求勘测队把马跑泉附近几十公里的土地都勘测一遍，把马跑泉车站设计成一公里宽、六公里多长的大车站，在这个车站里有全部机械化的设备，有双驼峰式、单驼峰式的调车场。从设备上来看，这确是中国从来没有过的大车站。
    这个车站设计好以后，设计局另一位工程师认为太大了，目前是用不着的。但设计这个车站的工程师却说：“你怎么知道用不着，将来到共产主义建设时，天兰铁路还要发展成三线、四线哩！”
    这个车站设计的虽然非常华丽，但在技术上却有许多严重的错误。苏联专家祖布可夫同志到现场调查以后，指出这个车站设计的错误：列车进出车站要绕十二公里以上的弯路；要多修一座三百多公尺长的渭河桥；要多筑一道防沙沟；要占用八千多亩良田；要毁掉几座果园。祖布可夫同志认为：目前已经有了北道埠车站，只要稍加整修就够应用，用不着再建筑马跑泉车站。
    铁道部领导方面接受祖布可夫同志的建议，仍然使用原北道埠车站。据铁道部设计局站场课的估计，祖布可夫同志的建议使我国家财产避免了四千八百亿元的损失，这笔钱可以买三百二十架战斗机。
