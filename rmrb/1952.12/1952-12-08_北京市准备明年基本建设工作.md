    Beijing Prepares for Next Year's Capital Construction Work
    [This newspaper] Beijing's capital construction tasks for 1953 are significant, with municipal construction and building projects exceeding this year's volume by a factor of more than one. To ensure the successful completion of this work, Beijing's various capital construction departments are actively making preparations.
    To overcome the shortcomings of Beijing's capital construction work this year, which included a lack of comprehensive and practical planning, the Beijing Enterprise Company, the Construction Bureau, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau began compiling plans for 1953 as early as September. Following the Financial and Economic Conference of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Beijing Municipal People's Government conveyed and deployed the information at a city-wide cadre meeting. Subsequently, all departments across the city universally commenced compiling plans for 1953. The compilation of draft plans by various units is expected to be generally completed in December. To strengthen coordination and avoid the phenomenon of repairing roads only to dig them up again for sewer and cable repairs, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, the Construction Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and other departments have also adopted joint office methods to jointly study and formulate municipal construction plans. Currently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government is comprehensively compiling statistics on the city's capital construction tasks, studying the city's design, construction, material, and transportation capabilities, estimating its actual capacity, in order to make overall considerations and concrete plans; and in conjunction with this work, reviewing the plans of various departments, distinguishing the priorities of each project according to the principle of key construction, differentiating between the important, the urgent, and the secondary, preparing to rank the projects.
    To strengthen Beijing's capital construction forces, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government have successively transferred cadres from various departments and allocated a group of cadres transferred from the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to enrich the capital construction organizations since the second half of this year. The relevant departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Government have successively held statistical training classes and verification training classes, including capital construction verification work, to strengthen grass-roots capital construction organizations. Recently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to select a large number of outstanding cadres from the existing cadres and send them to various capital construction departments. Regarding organizational structure, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to establish a Construction Engineering Bureau on the basis of the Construction Company. Under the leadership of this bureau, a design department will be established, and several construction engineering companies will be established according to the different nature of the projects. The Municipal Enterprise Company, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Construction Bureau, and the Sanitation Engineering Bureau are also establishing and improving their own and their affiliated factories' capital construction organizations. Among them, the capital construction department of the Municipal Enterprise Company was established earlier. After adding cadres this year, it has become a stronger department of the company. To strengthen the leadership of capital construction planning work, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has also established a capital construction planning department.
    Beijing has gained many experiences and lessons in design work this year. Many projects suffered from inadequate design due to rushed preparations, lack of investigation and surveying, and unclear design objectives, resulting in rework and modifications after construction. To this end, the Beijing Construction Company stipulates that designers must go deep into the construction site for inspection during the rush work campaign, and is currently beginning to summarize design work in conjunction with learning from advanced Soviet experience, analyzing the causes, and finding lessons in order to improve. This year's experience also shows that early design and the establishment of design progress plans are important conditions for doing a good job in design. Therefore, the Beijing Construction Company has decided to intensify next year's design work this winter and establish a design plan after the projects are ranked. Other capital construction departments have also started design work. For example, the road project of the Municipal Construction Bureau has now completed 20% of next year's design and is expected to be completed in full by March next year.
    Beijing's work on fixing and training workers and cadres is underway. To meet the task of larger road projects next year, the Beijing Construction Bureau plans to fix the existing road workers to two thousand. To prepare for the implementation of the economic accounting system, the bureau has held cadre training classes to conduct training in statistics, finance, and material management. The Beijing Construction Company has decided to recruit and fix 10,000 workers, and plans to promote a group of site directors from among the worker cadres in a planned manner. The company has established a "Winter Training Committee" and formulated a plan to conduct political and technical education for these workers and cadres. In addition, the company also plans to organize hundreds of grass-roots cadres and activists from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to conduct training in conjunction with summarizing experience, in order to improve their ideological level and professional ability, so that they can become the backbone of next year's capital construction work.
    Beijing's capital construction projects next year will not only be larger in quantity, but also higher in standards than this year, and the time required to complete the projects will also be stricter, so the preparation of materials needs to be carried out early. The Beijing Financial and Economic Committee is actively preparing a plan for the supply of locally produced building materials. In order to gradually achieve unified and planned production and distribution, the committee has formulated unified distribution methods for bricks, tiles, and lime, which will be promulgated and implemented soon. For materials purchased from other places, the committee has notified the relevant capital construction departments to submit the quantity and specifications as soon as possible so that timely planning can be carried out. In view of the fact that the progress of the project was affected this year due to insufficient transportation capacity in the city, the committee stipulates that materials for projects that have been determined and span the year must be stored and transported in advance. The committee is studying and solving the problem of insufficient transportation capacity in the city with relevant departments.
    Beijing's experiences and lessons this year also show that another important reason for not completing the original plan this year is that the leading organs at all levels did not pay enough attention to capital construction work, and the relevant competent departments did not better organize forces and summarize experience. To this end, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government have instructed the relevant departments that capital construction work must be placed in the primary position, and the work experience of this year must be summarized quickly, in order to ensure the victorious completion of the capital construction tasks of the capital in 1953.

    北京市准备明年基本建设工作
    【本报讯】北京市一九五三年的基本建设任务重大，市政建设、建筑工程将超过今年的一倍。为了做好这一工作，北京市各基本建设部门正积极进行准备。
    为了克服北京市今年基本建设工作中缺乏全盘的切合实际的计划的缺点，北京市企业公司、建设局、卫生工程局、公用局等部门在九月即开始编制一九五三年的计划。在政务院华北行政委员会的财政经济会议以后，北京市人民政府在全市干部会议上作了传达布置，全市各部门即普遍开始编制一九五三年的计划，各单位的计划草案的编制，预计在十二月一般可告结束。为了加强配合，避免刚修过马路，又翻开来修下水道、电缆的现象，卫生工程局、建设局、公用局等部门还采用了联合办公的办法，统一研究制定市政建设计划。目前，北京市人民政府财政经济委员会正全面统计全市的基本建设任务，研究全市设计、施工、材料、运输的情况，估算其实际能力，以便通盘考虑，具体计划；并结合这一工作审核各部门的计划，将各项工程按照重点建设的原则，分清轻重缓急、主要次要，准备进行工程排队。
    为了加强北京市的基本建设力量，中共北京市委和市人民政府于今年下半年起即陆续从各部门抽调干部，并分配了一批由中共中央华北局调来的干部，充实基本建设机构。北京市人民政府有关部门，先后举办了统计训练班及包括基本建设查定工作的查定训练班，加强基本建设基层组织。最近，中共北京市委已决定从现有的干部中选择大批优秀的干部，增派到各基本建设部门中去。关于组织机构，北京市人民政府已决定以建筑公司为基础成立建筑工程局，在该局领导下，成立设计部门，并将根据不同的工程性质，成立若干建筑工程公司。市企业公司、公用局、建设局、卫生工程局也正在建立与健全其本身和所属工厂的基本建设机构。其中以市企业公司的基本建设部门建立较早，经今年增添干部后，已成为该公司较强的部门。为了加强基本建设计划工作的领导，北京市人民政府财政经济委员会还建立了基本建设计划部门。
    北京市今年在设计工作方面取得了不少经验教训，不少工程由于准备工作仓促，缺乏调查、勘测，设计目的不明确，因而设计不周，发生施工后又返工修改的现象。为此，北京市建筑公司规定设计人员在抢工运动中必须深入工地检查，最近正在开始结合学习苏联先进经验总结设计工作，分析原因，找出教训，以求改进。今年的经验也说明，提早设计和订立设计进度计划是作好设计的重要条件。因此，北京市建筑公司已决定在今冬加紧进行明年的设计工作，并在工程排队后，订立设计计划。其他基本建设部门也已经开始了设计工作，如市建设局的道路工程现已完成明年的设计百分之二十，预计明年三月即可全部完工。
    北京市固定和训练工人、干部的工作正在进行。北京市建设局为迎接明年更大的道路工程的任务，已计划把现有道路工人固定到二千名。为了准备实行经济核算制，该局已经举办了干部训练班，分别进行统计、财务、材料管理等方面的训练。北京市建筑公司已决定吸收固定工人一万人，并有计划地从工人干部中提拔一批工地主任。该公司已经成立了“冬季训练委员会”，拟定了对这些工人、干部进行政治、技术教育的计划。此外，该公司还计划组织党、行政、工会、青年团的基层干部和积极分子数百名，结合总结经验，进行训练，以提高这些人的思想水平和业务能力，使之成为明年基本建设工作中的骨干。
    北京市明年的基本建设工程不但数量较大，标准将比今年提高，工程完成的时间也要求严格，因此材料的准备工作需要早日进行。地方生产的建筑材料供应计划，北京市财政经济委员会正在积极拟制。为了逐渐作到统一地、有计划地生产和分配，该会已经拟定了砖瓦灰的统一分配办法，不久即可公布施行。外地采购的物资，该会已通知各基本建设部门，早日提出数量、规格，以便及时筹划。鉴于今年曾因市内运输力不足而影响了工程进行，该会规定已经确定的和跨年度的工程必须提前储运材料。市内运输力量不足的问题，该会正在与有关部门研究解决。
    北京市今年的经验教训也说明，今年没有完成原定计划的另一重要原因，是各级领导机关对基本建设工作重视不够，有关主管部门没有更好地组织力量、总结经验。为此，中共北京市委和北京市人民政府已指示有关部门，必须把基本建设工作放在首要地位，并迅速地作出今年的工作经验总结，以便保证一九五三年首都基本建设任务胜利完成。
