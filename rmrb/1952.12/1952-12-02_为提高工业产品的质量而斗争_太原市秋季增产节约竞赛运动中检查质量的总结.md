    Struggle to Improve the Quality of Industrial Products
    ——Summary of Quality Inspection in Taiyuan City's Autumn Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Han Chunde, Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Taiyuan (I)
    Over the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and higher-level enterprise authorities, and through the arduous efforts of all workers and staff, the quantity and quality of products in state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan City have significantly improved. However, due to the incomplete transformation of old enterprises, factories and mines still face the problem of producing more but also wasting and stockpiling more. The main reason for waste and stockpiling is the high rate of rejects and substandard products. Related to this are high raw material consumption, slow product sales, and slow turnover of working capital. This series of problems became more apparent during the ideological criticism and business consolidation in the later stages of the "Three-Anti" movement. Therefore, establishing a complete production concept and overcoming the tendency to emphasize quantity over quality and disregard costs has become the most practically significant task for completing the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy and production reform. And solving the quality problem is a problem with a prerequisite nature.
    Poor product quality and a high number of rejects and substandard products are directly due to the lack of a sense of responsibility among workers and staff, but this also has its historical roots. During the reactionary rule, workers and staff adopted many methods of deceiving and fooling the enemy. At that time, adopting such methods was considered a "skill." After liberation, the relations of production changed, and this situation also changed significantly. However, because we have not systematically educated workers and staff in this area, they still quite commonly, but not consciously, inherit that set of practices for dealing with bureaucratic capitalists. Therefore, we must solve the problem of establishing a quality concept as a production reform issue, intensively and systematically, to further improve the workers' and staff's level of consciousness as masters of their own affairs.
    Product quality problems are an issue with significant interaction and mutual influence among various enterprises in the city. For example, the low quality of coal from coal mines directly affects the increase in ash content of coke; and the increase in ash content of coke directly affects the reduction in output and quality of the iron smelting department; iron further affects the quality of steel, and steel affects the product quality of the machinery manufacturing industry. Furthermore, the size and normality of electricity and voltage, which serve as industrial power, directly affect the rotation and safety of machines. Failure to deliver electricity safely means failure to guarantee normal production. In the past, all parties felt that the mutual influence was great, and there were frequent complaints, but the problem could not be solved, and no one was willing to admit their mistakes. Therefore, to solve the quality problem, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and take a certain amount of time to solve it intensively throughout the city.
    Because the quality problem is a historical and mass problem, and also a problem with connection and universality, it is absolutely necessary to launch a mass quality inspection movement throughout the city during the increase production and practice economy campaign, first solving it from the perspective of ideological concepts. (II)
    In implementing the policy of combining increased production and practicing economy with production reform, Taiyuan City, according to the instructions of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial Committee, took improving product quality and solving technical management problems as the main work in the third quarter of this year, and promoting advanced experience as the main method for doing this work well. The solution to product quality problems in various factories and mines in Taiyuan City has generally gone through the following three steps:
    The first step: mobilize the masses to expose existing problems in product quality.
    At the beginning of the inspection, there were different ideological concerns among the broad masses of workers and staff: first, they were afraid that after exposing shortcomings, the leadership would not believe or pay attention to them; second, they were afraid of being demoted and having their salaries reduced; third, they were afraid of being held accountable and sent to court; fourth, they were afraid of losing face and reducing their prestige among the masses (this was mainly for engineers, technicians, and veteran workers). To dispel these concerns and deepen the movement, it is necessary to emphasize clearing up ideological issues and enhancing consciousness. The main methods are:
    (1) Leaders take the lead in self-criticism at all levels. Because the leading cadres themselves have serious ideas of emphasizing quantity over quality and disregarding costs, they have fostered a phenomenon of no one being responsible for quality in many areas below. If leading cadres do not inspect and correct themselves, the problem cannot be truly solved. Leading cadres first making self-criticisms dispels the concerns of the masses.
    (2) Grasp typical examples to promote the general. The best choice of typical examples is: those who bear certain leadership responsibilities, who play a decisive role in certain key issues, who have technical skills but also many bad habits in their work, and whose thinking has been truly cleared up to make a typical self-criticism. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant held a plant-wide typical demonstration meeting. Within a few days, the movement developed universally and deeply. The steelmaking, rolling, transportation, and power departments alone exposed more than 1,100 problems.
    (3) Quality exhibition education. Using vivid facts and detailed accounts to educate the masses is the most practical and concrete education. After seeing the quality exhibition, everyone unanimously reflected: "We knew about scrapping before, but we didn't realize it was so serious." Many people shed tears of shame after seeing the losses caused to the country by the rejects they made.
    (4) Solicit user opinions. After the workers and staff of the steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant learned that the water turbine chains made by the Shanxi Machine Factory with their steel were unusable, and clarified the major relationship between their production and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, they raised their awareness, and the quality of their products improved significantly.
    In addition, various factories and mines held various forms of propaganda and education during the inspection, such as "rejects seminars" and "materials complaining," which all played a positive role in promoting the movement.
    Through thorough exposure, we have deeply recognized the seriousness of the quality problem:
    (1) Many rejects and substandard products increase costs, stockpile funds, seriously affect product reputation, and affect the relationship between various state-owned and local state-owned enterprises. According to the statistics of six workshops in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in the first half of this year, the value of steel stockpiled due to poor quality reached 18 billion yuan. As a result, some units are unwilling to purchase steel produced in the city and go to distant places to purchase it. The value of rejects in the Taiyuan Machine Factory last year alone reached 3.2 billion yuan. In the first half of this year, the 247 Factory had 13,475 industrial and material rejects. Due to the dominance of capitalist management thinking, the "Shunfeng Cigarettes" of the Taiyuan Tobacco Factory were of poor quality, lost market reputation, and the products were heavily stockpiled, unable to be sold, working capital could not be turned over, and normal production could not be maintained. Finally, they had to be sold at a loss, laying off employees and reducing production.
    (2) After the problems were fully exposed, what surprised us was that, due to the lack of correct quality concepts among many workers and staff, they unconsciously inherited the past methods of deceiving and fooling in various production links, and some even objectively formed acts of sabotage. For example, the coal tar produced by the gas absorption room of the coking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is the main raw material for by-products such as carbolic acid, asphalt, and sanitary balls. However, when the Li Yuqi (Party member) group in the gas absorption room failed to complete its task at the end of the month, it mixed waste washing oil into the coal tar to make up the number. In July alone, 14 tons of waste oil were mixed into the 70 tons of coal tar produced, with an average of 10 to 20 tons mixed in each time. This not only affects the quality of carbolic acid, making it inferior, and making asphalt brittle, but also easily causes poisoning incidents for sanitary ball operators.
    (3) There is a phenomenon of opposition between production workshops and inspection personnel. Workers and staff in various factories often adopt methods of cheating, muddling through, and dragging on to deal with inspection personnel, trying their best to hide and conceal the rejects they produce, or delaying delivery, waiting for the inventory to be empty and the task to be urgent before delivering them. This is the so-called "radishes (sold) quickly are not washed of mud, scarcity is precious." Some even threw the rejects into grass piles and toilets when they could not deliver them.
    The existence of these problems is certainly inseparable from the low technical level, simple equipment, and many problems in production management, but it is mainly due to the historical habits of the masses, which are supported by the leadership's view of purely quantitative tasks.
    The main problems in the leadership's thinking are:
    Complacency. Satisfied with the improvements after liberation, looking backward compared to the period of Japanese puppets and bandits, instead of looking at national standards and advanced standards.
    Lack of a comprehensive production view. The view of purely quantitative tasks directly fosters the workers' and staff's view of emphasizing quantity over quality. Many foremen, group leaders, and even some workshop directors and department directors also adopted an attitude of opposition to inspection personnel. Some foremen, group leaders, and workshop directors even personally came forward to intercede and defend the rejects produced by workers. During this exposure of problems, the workers made a very vivid summary of this situation: "Foremen and directors turn a blind eye in order to complete the task; workers are perfunctory and engage in liberalism in order to compete for points and awards and get on the blackboard bulletin."
    Capitalist management thinking. When a product gains market reputation and the supply cannot meet the demand, they blindly produce crudely and pursue profits. As a result, credit declines, the market is lost, and stockpiling occurs (such as cigarettes).
    Some engineers and technicians have a desire for fame and profit and become detached from the masses, resulting in unsound designs and losses. In the rolling department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the small rolling rejects alone caused losses of 12.295 billion yuan in June and July due to faulty designs by technicians.
    The manifestations among the workers and staff are:
    Conservative thinking. Believing that the current product quality is much better than during the rule of the Japanese puppets and bandits. Some believe that their factory's technology is unique and does not need to be improved. Some veteran technicians rely on their skilled techniques, do not look at blueprints, and do not follow operating procedures. Some say, "You can't help but slip if you walk on ice for a long time, and you can't help but get your feet wet if you stand by the river for a long time," using this to defend the production of rejects and substandard products.
    Departmentalism, disregarding the whole. For example, the front shift of the open-hearth furnace section of the steelmaking department of the Iron and Steel Plant opens the gas valve wider near the end of the shift to produce more steel and earn more awards, resulting in burning out the nozzle and extending the melting time of the next shift.
    Selfishness, competing for points and awards. In order to complete the task and get awards, they desperately pursue quantity. For example, when the steelmaking department of the Iron and Steel Plant pours steel ingots, Soviet experts instructed to pour 350 meters per minute, while the workers poured 400 to 500 meters per minute. As a result, the speed was too fast, and the gas could not be released, causing a large number of subcutaneous bubbles.
    Through quality inspection, serious problems in production management were also exposed, which clearly tells us what problems should be solved in production reform. These problems are:
    Unsound design and inaccurate drawings. The 247 Factory was contracted to make a certain product. The original drawing was 50 millimeters, but after making 200 pieces, it was changed to 48 millimeters. The workers reflected: "The work is finished, but the drawings cannot be changed." When producing another product, it was necessary to modify the drawings. All aspects were modified, but the riveting department was not, resulting in the production of a batch of rejects.
    Raw materials do not meet specifications, affecting the proportion of ingredients; waste materials are issued, and wrong materials are issued. The proportion of raw coal ingredients for coking in the Iron and Steel Plant is 55% Fujiatan coal and 45% Xishan coal, but in order to unload more coal and get more awards, the loaders in the transportation department unloaded Fujiatan coal and Xishan coal together, making the proportion of coking raw materials inaccurate and the ash content ratio unable to be guaranteed. The production department领钢料 (I'm not sure what this means in this context), and the materials department mistakenly issued copper materials. The production department wanted to cast steel, and the materials department mistakenly issued cast iron. Such examples are endless.
    The technical inspection system has problems, lacking necessary inspection instruments and equipment, especially the lack of mass mutual supervision. The number of inspection personnel is both small and weak, and they lack a high degree of responsibility.
    There is no product responsibility system. When rejects are produced, the person responsible cannot be found. Production management lacks precise control over every specific link.
    Technical operations are inconsistent. In the past, competitions were based on班 (shifts) as units, which has proven to be wrong. Because班 (shifts) compete with each other for red flags and scores, they scheme against each other, even artificially creating difficulties for other shifts, often causing damage to machines, reduced quality, and many other unnecessary accidents.
    Some units have no written operating procedures at all. Some units have them, but they are not practical and cannot be mastered by the masses. Therefore, they rely on experience, and traditional conservative ideas resist advanced experience.
    The second step: extensively promote advanced experience to solve quality problems.
    The main method to solve quality problems must be to improve technology, not anything else. In solving this problem, we take the technical promotion movement combining the decentralized mass method of finding窍门 (tricks or keys) with the organized and planned promotion of decisive advanced experience by the leadership as the basic method. After the broad masses of workers and staff have a correct understanding of quality, their consciousness is raised, and their enthusiasm for striving to produce excellent quality products is very high. At this time, the leadership points out that promoting advanced experience is the best way to improve quality, and the masses' acceptance of advanced experience will be conscious. Therefore, educating the masses to establish a quality viewpoint paves the way for promoting advanced experience.
    Since the launch of the competition movement on "July 1st," through the mass movement of finding窍门 (tricks or keys), a total of 5,893 relatively important窍门 (tricks or keys) have been proposed in 38 factories and mines, creating a broad atmosphere of respecting technology and overcoming conservative ideas. Although the improvement of technology and quality has achieved certain results in the movement of finding窍门 (tricks or keys), the key issues have not yet been resolved. At this time, the leadership adopted the method of "red flag"课题 (project)悬赏 (reward), that is, with the goal of solving key problems in production, using the method of "red flag reward" to attract the scattered wisdom of the broad masses to focus on solving key problems. This pushes the movement of promoting advanced experience to a climax. This method has clear goals and timely rewards (because the value has been calculated in advance). At the same time, through the organization of the leadership, each workshop and section can not only strive to solve the key problems of its own workshop and section, but also strive to solve the key problems of the entire factory, so that the masses of the entire factory can be mobilized under a centralized slogan.
    In the process of solving quality problems, another important experience is: improving technology and improving quality must emphasize the close combination of technical personnel and workers. This time, most of the engineers and technicians were involved in the movement. In the movement, the combination of technical personnel and workers was particularly emphasized, thus overcoming the previous phenomenon of mutual contempt. Facts have proved that where the combination is good, the technical improvement results are great, and the quality problems are solved well. Gao Dengshan's coal washing operation method and Wang Hailiang's advanced operation method of ammonium sulfate crystal centrifuge were all summarized with the help of engineers. The elimination of blackhead coke and the reduction of coke ash content in the coking department of the Iron and Steel Plant were also the result of the combination of engineers and technicians and workers. Experience has proved that the process of combining engineers and technicians with workers is the process of combining technology and labor, theory and practice, and also the process of ideological transformation of engineers and technicians. In the practice of the movement, engineers and technicians felt that only by relying on the masses and drawing窍门 (tricks or keys) from the workers can they exert and improve technology. The workers also felt the importance of theoretical guidance, thus achieving mutual respect and unity.
    The third step: revise technical operating procedures to consolidate quality from the system.
    In the past, many new records of advanced product quality have also appeared in various factories and mines, but because they have not been carefully analyzed and summarized, and consolidated from the perspective of technical operation and management system, the results are mostly a flash in the pan, or in an unstable wave state. The incomplete and impractical technical operating procedures that cannot be mastered by the masses, and the fact that some factories and mines have no written technical operating procedures and no product responsibility system, are one of the main reasons for the occurrence of rejects and substandard products.
    This time, after the key problems were generally solved, the engineers and technicians helped the masses to systematically summarize the advanced experience and窍门 (tricks or keys) through discussion, and to formulate and supplement technical operating procedures. In addition, some units also stipulated the duties and responsibilities of engineers and technicians, as well as the quality responsibility system in each link. This not only ensures that the quality of products will continue to rise steadily in the future, but also makes the reform of technical management a preliminary solution. (III)
    After the quality inspection movement, new changes have taken place in the production of various factories and mines. To sum up, the main achievements are in the following two aspects:
    First, the technical level has been significantly improved. As of the end of September, the area of推广 (promoting) high-speed cutting methods in the machinery industry has reached an average of 50%, of which the Taiyuan Machine Factory has reached 80% to 90%, and the work efficiency has increased by an average of 1 to 2 times. The advanced methods such as leaking mold, multi-mold, double-layer modeling and division of labor casting have been universally推广 (promoted) in all foundry workshops in the machinery industry. In the construction industry, the Su Changyou bricklaying method and the woodworking assembly line operation method have been推广 (promoted) to 35.5% of long-term workers and pieceworkers, and individual units have reached 66%. The power industry has universally推广 (promoted) the experience of burning low-quality coal, and the utilization rate has increased to 40% to 80%. As a result, Power Plant No. 1 has reduced coal consumption costs by 25%. After quality inspection, the steelmaking department of the Iron and Steel Plant conscientiously implemented the five major advanced working methods instructed by Soviet experts: controlling furnace temperature, refining for 50 minutes, quieting for 10 minutes, baking steel ladles at 500 to 700 degrees, and pouring slowly. It should be said that this推广 (promotion) of advanced experience and the improvement of technology is the highest period of technical upsurge in the three years since liberation. Judging from the speed, the progress in three months is at least equivalent to the previous year; judging from the depth and breadth, not only has the推广 (promotion) of advanced technology in the main industrial production workshops increased month by month, but also accounting, administrative, warehouse and other departments have created and推广 (promoted) many advanced working methods, such as the accounting department's creation of gear working methods and wage conversion devices.
    Second, product quality has been rapidly improved. According to the statistics of 33 main products in August, compared with July, the quality of 24 products has improved, and the changes in 9 products are not significant. The quality of major products has generally improved. For example, the subcutaneous bubbles of open-hearth steel ingots in the steelmaking department of the Iron and Steel Plant have dropped from 7% in the past to 0.86%, and further dropped to 0.2% in October, creating a new record in history. 100% of metallurgical coke is qualified, and the ash content of coke has dropped from 13.5% in the past to below 12.8%, and has remained stable. The average skin roller flower of the Jinsheng Textile Factory has dropped from 1.23% to 0.7%, and the substandard cloth rate has dropped from 1.8% to 0.06%. The Liang Ming group of the Dongshan Coal Mine carried out the rapid excavation cycle operation method and implemented the safety system. Not only did the output increase from 1.08 tons to 1.66 tons, but also the quality was improved. The lump coal increased from 40% to 60%, and the safe production was maintained for 28 months. The reject rate of machine frames in the Shanxi Machine Factory averaged 36.8% from September 1st to 9th. After the implementation of the "课题 (project)悬赏 (reward)" on September 10th, it dropped to 14.9% within four days, creating a historical record. Fifteen of the 28 production groups in a workshop of the 743 Factory created the glorious record of no rejects in the entire group.
    At the beginning of the movement, many engineers and technicians held a skeptical attitude towards the movement, believing that "the Communist Party is good at leading democratic reforms and the Three-Anti Movement, but they may not be good at production technology reforms"; now, they have realized that "the Communist Party can not only lead political reforms, but also is good at leading production reforms." Therefore, they feel that only by relying on the Party and relying on the masses can they better exert technology and improve technology. In the past, cadres in the management department believed that "production competition is the workers' business, and we can't get involved"; now they also feel that there is a direction for the work, and the problem of facing production has been specifically solved. An old worker in the 247 Factory said: "Before liberation, we couldn't even get enough red rice and bran to eat. After liberation, Chairman Mao cares about us workers everywhere. The democratic reform removed the big stones, and the wage reform improved our lives. If we don't produce well, we are really sorry to Chairman Mao and sorry to our own conscience."
    The process of solving product quality problems also educated and improved our leading cadres, making us further realize that the process of transforming old enterprises is a process of solving many complex contradictions. In the complex process of production development, we must learn to be good at discovering and grasping the main contradictions, and continuously push the entire production work forward by solving the main contradictions. In the past, we solved the contradiction between the feudal remnants left over by the old enterprises and the broad masses of workers and staff with the method of democratic reform. In this production reform process, we solved the contradiction between producing more and wasting more by the method of checking quality. At present, we must also solve the contradiction between the masses' high production enthusiasm and the leadership's poor planning and unfamiliarity with business, in order to thoroughly complete the historical task of production reform and welcome the country's large-scale economic construction.

    为提高工业产品的质量而斗争
    ——太原市秋季增产节约竞赛运动中检查质量的总结
    中共太原市委书记太原市人民政府市长韩纯德（一）
    三年多来，太原市各国营和地方国营厂矿，在中国共产党和上级企业主管部门的正确领导下，经过全体职工的艰苦努力，产品数量、质量都有显著提高。但由于旧企业的改造工作尚未完成，各厂矿在生产中仍存在着生产多，浪费、积压也多的现象。造成浪费、积压的主要原因，是废品与次品率大。与此相联系的则是原材料消耗多、产品滞销、流动资金周转缓慢。这一系列问题，在“三反”运动后期思想批判与业务整顿中暴露得更加明显。因此，树立完整的生产观念，克服重数量、轻质量、不计成本的倾向，就成为完成增产节约任务与生产改革任务最具有现实意义的工作了。而解决质量问题则是带有先决条件性质的问题。
    产品质量低劣和废品多、次品多，虽然直接是由于职工责任心不够，但这也是有其历史根源的。在反动统治时期，职工群众对付敌人采取了许多欺哄捣鬼办法。那时候，采取这种办法被认为是一种“本事”。解放以后生产关系改变了，这种情况也有了很大改变。但由于我们在这方面没有对职工进行系统的教育，职工中还相当普遍地、但不是自觉地因袭着那一套对付官僚资本家的作法。因此，我们必须把树立质量观念问题，作为一个生产改革性质的问题，集中地系统地加以解决，以进一步提高职工群众的主人翁的自觉程度。
    产品质量问题，在全市各个企业之间，是相互影响，互相作用，牵连很大的一项问题。如煤矿的煤质低劣，就直接影响到焦炭灰分的增大；而焦炭灰分加大，又直接影响炼铁部门产量减少、质量降低；铁又进一步影响到钢的质量，钢则影响机器制造业的产品质量。又如作为工业动力的电力、电压的大小、正常与否，均直接影响到机器的转动与安全，不能安全送电，就不能保证正常生产。平时各个方面都深感相互影响很大，时有怨言，但总是不能解决问题，而且谁都不愿承认自己的错误。因此，解决质量问题，必须发动群众，在全市范围内拿出一定的时间来集中地加以解决。
    由于质量问题是一个带有历史性、群众性的问题，又是一个具有联系性和普遍性的问题，因此，在增产节约运动中，在全市范围内展开一个群众性的质量检查运动，首先从思想概念上加以解决，是完全必要的。（二）
    在执行增产节约和生产改革相结合的方针中，太原市根据中共中央华北局和山西省委的指示，在今年第三季度以提高产品质量解决技术管理问题为主要工作，以推广先进经验为作好这一工作的主要方法。太原市各厂矿产品质量问题的解决，大体经过以下三个步骤，即：
    第一步：发动群众，揭发产品质量上存在的问题。
    开始检查时，广大职工中曾存在着不同的思想顾虑：一怕暴露缺点之后，领导不相信、不重视；二怕降级减薪；三怕追究责任坐法院；四怕丢面子，降低在群众中的威信（这一种主要是工程技术人员、老师傅）。为了解除这些顾虑，使运动深入，必须强调打通思想，提高自觉。主要方法是：
    （1）领导带头，层层检讨。由于领导干部本身存在着严重的重量轻质、不计成本的思想，助长了下边许多在质量方面无人负责现象。领导干部不检查不纠正，就不能真正解决问题。领导干部首先检讨，则解除了群众顾虑。
    （2）抓住典型，推动一般。典型的选择最好是：负一定领导责任的、在某些关键性质的问题上有决定性作用、有技术但工作中的坏办法也多，而思想又真正搞通了的人去作典型检讨。太原钢铁厂开了一个全厂典型示范大会，数日之内运动普遍深入开展，仅炼钢、轧钢、运输、动力等四个部，就揭发了问题一千一百余件。
    （3）质量展览教育。用活生生的事实算细账来教育群众，这是最实际、最具体的教育。看过质量展览后，大家一致反映：“以前知道报废，但没有认识到这样严重。”许多人看过自己制造的废品对国家造成的损失后，惭愧得流了眼泪。
    （4）征求用户意见。太原钢铁厂炼钢部职工了解到山西机器厂用他们的钢制成的水车链子不能用，并弄清了自己的生产和巩固工农联盟的重大关系后，遂提高觉悟，产品质量就有显著提高。
    此外各厂矿在检查中，还举行了“废品座谈”、
    “材料诉苦”等多种多样的宣传教育，都对运动起了积极的推动作用。
    经过彻底的揭发暴露，使我们深刻地认识了质量问题的严重性：
    （1）报废多、次品多，因而增大了成本，积压了资金，严重地影响产品信誉，也影响各个国营、地方国营企业之间的关系。据太原钢铁厂今年上半年六个车间的统计，因质量低劣所积压的钢材价值达一百八十亿元。有的单位因此不愿购用本市生产的钢材，而到远处去购买。太原机器厂去年一年的报废价值即达三十二亿元。二四七厂今年上半年工废、料废达一三、四七五件。太原烟草厂，由于资本主义经营思想作祟，“顺风烟”质量低劣，失去市场信誉，产品大量积压，销不出去，资金周转不开，不能维持正常生产，最后不得不赔本出售，裁员减产。
    （2）问题充分揭露后，使我们吃惊的是，由于许多职工缺乏正确的质量观念，在各个生产环节上都不自觉地因袭了过去的欺骗捣鬼办法，有的甚至在客观上形成暗害行为。如太原钢铁厂炼焦部吸气房生产的焦油，是石炭酸、沥青、卫生球等副产品的主要原料，但吸气房李玉骐（党员）小组，到月底完不成任务时，即将废洗油渗入焦油内凑数上交，仅七月份生产的七十吨焦油中，即渗入废油十四吨，平均每次渗入都在十吨到二十吨。这不仅影响石炭酸质量变劣，沥青发脆，而且极易造成卫生球操作工人的中毒事件。
    （3）生产车间和检验人员之间存在着对立现象。各厂职工对付检验人员，常常采取骗、混、拖的办法，尽量设法使自己生产的废品隐瞒和蒙混过去，或者拖延不交，等着库存空虚任务紧急时再交。这是所谓“萝卜（卖）快了不洗泥，缺者为贵”。有的甚至在交不了时，将废品抛到草堆、厕所中去。
    这些问题的存在，其原因固然是和技术水平低、设备简陋以及生产管理上的许多问题分不开的，但主要是群众的历史习惯，得到领导方面单纯数量任务观点的支持所致。
    领导思想上的主要问题是：
    自满情绪。满足于解放后的改进，与日伪时代相比，眼睛向后看，而不向全国标准、先进标准看。
    缺乏全面的生产观点。单纯的数量任务观点，直接助长了工人群众的重量轻质观点。有许多工长、组长自己也捣鬼，某些车间主任甚至部主任也采取了与检验人员对立的态度。一部分工长、组长、车间主任还亲自出马为工人生产的废品讲情辩护。这次暴露问题当中，工人们对这种情况作了一个很生动的总结：“工长、主任睁一只眼，合一只眼，为的是完成任务；工友们马虎应付，自由主义，为的是争分得奖，上黑板报”。
    资本主义的经营思想。当某一产品取得了市场信誉，供不应求时，就盲目地粗制滥造，追求利润。结果信用降低，失去市场，造成积压（如纸烟）。
    某些工程技术人员有名利思想，脱离群众，设计不周，造成损失。太原钢铁厂轧钢部就是因技术人员设计的孔型有毛病，仅六、七两月份小型轧钢报废损失即达一百二十二亿九千五百万元。
    在工人群众中的表现则是：
    保守思想。认为现在的产品质量比日伪、阎匪统治时期已经好得多了。有的认为自己厂子的技术是独一无二的，不需要再改进了。有些老技工自恃技术熟练，作活不看图纸，不遵守操作规程。有的说：“久走冰路不能不滑倒，久站河边不能不湿脚”，以此来给出废品、次品辩护。
    本位主义，不顾整体。如钢铁厂炼钢部平炉工段前班临下班时开大煤气，争取自己多出钢，多得奖，结果烧坏喷出口，延长下一班熔炼时间。
    自私自利，争分夺奖。为了完成任务得奖，拼命追求数量。如钢铁厂炼钢部浇注钢锭，苏联专家指示每分钟浇注三百五十公尺，而工人们每分钟浇注四百到五百公尺，结果速度太快，气体放不出来，造成大量的皮下气泡。
    通过质量检查，也暴露了生产管理方面存在的严重问题，这就确切地告诉我们生产改革应解决什么问题。这些问题是：
    设计不周，图纸不精确。二四七厂承作某产品，原图五十公厘，作了二百个以后又改为四十八公厘。工人反映：“活作完了，图亦改不完”。在生产另一产品时，需要修改图纸，各方面都改了，但铆工部未改，结果生产了一批废品。
    原材料不合规格，影响配料比例；发废料、发错料。钢铁厂炼焦用原煤配料比例是百分之五十五的富家滩煤，百分之四十五的西山煤，但运输部装卸工为了多卸煤、多得奖；却把富家滩煤与西山煤卸在一起，使炼焦原料的比例失去准确性，灰分比例无法保证。生产部门领钢料，材料部门错发给铜料，生产部门要铸钢，材料部门错发给铸铁，此类事例不一而足。
    技术检验制度有毛病，缺乏必要的检验仪器与设备，尤其缺乏群众性的互相监督。检验人员既少且弱，又缺乏高度的负责精神。
    没有产品责任制。出了废品找不出应负责的人员，生产管理上缺乏对每一个具体环节的精密控制。
    技术操作不一致，过去竞赛以班为单位，经验证明是错误的。因为班与班之间为夺红旗、争分数，勾心斗角，不惜人为地给别班制造困难，结果常常造成机器损坏，质量降低等许多不应有的事故。
    有的单位根本没有成文的操作规程，有的单位虽有，但不切合实际，不能为群众所掌握，因此，凭经验办事，传统的保守思想抵触先进经验。
    第二步：大量推广先进经验，解决质量问题。
    解决质量问题的主要方法必须是提高技术，而不是别的。我们在解决这一问题时，是以分散的群众性的找窍门运动和领导上有组织有计划地推广带有决定意义的先进经验相结合的技术推广运动为基本方法。当广大职工群众对质量有正确的认识后，觉悟提高，争取生产优等质量产品的情绪很高。这时领导上即指出推广先进经验就是最好的改善质量的办法，而群众对先进经验的接受，就会是自觉的，因之，教育群众树立质量观点就为推广先进经验铺平了道路。
    自从“七一”开展竞赛运动以来，经过群众性的找窍门运动，在三十八个厂矿中共提出比较重要的窍门五千八百九十三件，造成了广泛的尊重技术和克服保守思想的空气。在找窍门运动中，技术与质量的提高虽然收到了一定的效果，但关键性的问题还没有解决。这时，领导上即采取红旗课题悬赏的办法，即以解决生产中的关键性问题为目标，以“红旗悬赏”的方法，把广大群众分散的智慧，吸引到集中解决关键问题上来。这样就把推广先进经验运动推向高潮。这种办法，目标明确，奖励及时（因事先已将价值算好）。同时，经过领导上的组织，就可使各个车间、工段不仅为解决本车间、本工段的关键问题而努力，而且又可为解决全厂性的关键问题而努力，这样就可以在集中性的口号下把全厂群众动员起来。
    在解决质量问题的过程中，另一重要的经验就是：提高技术，改善质量，必须强调技术人员和工人紧密结合。这一次，大部分工程技术人员都卷入了运动。在运动中特别强调了技术人员与工人相结合，因而克服了以往互相轻视的现象。事实证明，那里结合得好，那里的技术改进成绩就大，质量问题解决得就好。高登山的洗煤操作法和王海亮的硫酸錏还心分离机的先进操作法，都是经过了工程师帮助总结出来的。钢铁厂炼焦部消灭黑头焦和降低焦炭灰分，也是工程技术人员与工人相结合的结果。经验证明：工程技术人员与工人的结合过程，就是技术与劳力、理论与实践相结合的过程，同时也是对工程技术人员思想改造的过程。在运动的实践中，工程技术人员感到只有依靠群众，从工人中汲取窍门，才能发挥和提高技术。工人也感到理论指导的重要，因之达到互相尊重和团结。
    第三步：修订技术操作规程，从制度上巩固质量。
    过去各厂矿也曾出现过不少先进的产品质量新纪录，但由于没有进行认真的分析总结，从技术操作与管理制度上把它巩固下来，结果多属昙花一现，或呈波浪不稳状态。技术操作规程不完整、不实际，不能为群众所掌握，及某些厂矿根本无成文的技术操作规程，无产品责任制，乃是发生废品、次品的主要原因之一。
    这次在各个关键性的问题得到大体解决以后，即由工程技术人员帮助群众通过讨论把先进经验与窍门加以系统的总结，订定和补充技术操作规程，另外有些单位还规定了工程技术人员的职责条例，以及各个环节上的质量责任制。这不仅保证今后产品质量继续稳步上升，而且使技术管理的改革得到了
    一个初步的解决。（三）
    经过质量检查运动，各厂矿生产上出现了新的气象。总结起来，主要成绩有以下两个方面：
    一、技术水平有显著提高。截至九月底，机器业推广高速切削法的面，平均已达到百分之五十，其中太原机器厂达到百分之八九，工作效率平均提高一至二倍。所有机器业中的翻砂车间已普遍推广了漏模、多模、双层造型及分工浇铸等先进方法。建筑业中苏长有砌砖法、木工流水作业法已推广至长期工与计件工的百分之三十五点五，个别单位达到百分之六十六。电业系统已普遍推广了燃烧低质煤的经验，使用率提高到百分之四十到八十，发电一厂因此降低煤耗成本百分之二十五。钢铁厂炼钢部经过质量检查，认真贯彻了苏联专家指示的控制炉温、五十分钟精炼、十分钟镇静、烤盛钢筒五百至七百度、慢速浇注等五大先进工作法。应该说，这次先进经验的推广与技术的提高，是解放三年多来技术上最高涨的时期。从速度看，三个月的进步至少相当于以往的一年；从深度与广度看，不仅各主要产业生产车间先进技术推广面逐月扩大，而且会计、行政、仓库等部门也创造和推广了许多先进工作方法，如会计部门创造了齿轮工作法、工资换算器等。
    二、产品质量得到迅速的提高与改善。根据八月份三十三种主要产品的统计，和七月份相比较，提高质量者二十四种，变化不显著者九种。主要产品质量，一般均有提高。例如钢铁厂炼钢部平炉钢锭皮下气泡由过去百分之七降至百分之零点八六，十月份更降至百分之零点二，创造了历史上的新纪录。冶金焦百分之百的合格，焦炭灰分已由过去百分之十三点五降至百分之十二点八以下，并保持了平稳。晋生纺织厂皮辊花平均由百分之一点二三降至百分之零点七，次布率由百分之一点八降至百分之零点零六。东山煤矿梁明小组进行了快速掘进循环作业法，并执行了安全制度，不仅产量由一点零八吨提高到一点六六吨，并且提高了质量，块炭由百分之四十提高到百分之六十，并坚持了二十八个月的安全生产。山西机器厂机架报废率在九月一日至九日平均为百分之三十六点八，九月十日实行“课题悬赏”后，四天内即降至百分之十四点九，创造了历史纪录。七四三厂某车间二十八个生产小组，其中十五个小组创造了全组无废品的光荣纪录。
    在运动开始时，很多工程技术人员对运动抱着怀疑的态度，认为“共产党善于领导民主改革，三反运动，对生产技术上的改革恐怕搞不好”；现在，他们已认识到“共产党不仅会领导政治改革，而且也善于领导生产改革”。因此感到只有依靠党，依靠群众，才能更好地发挥技术，提高技术。管理部门干部过去认为“生产竞赛是工人的事，咱们插不上手”；现在也感到工作有方针了，具体解决了面向生产的问题。二四七厂一个老工人说：“解放前我们连红大米、麸皮子也吃不饱，解放后毛主席处处关心我们工人，民主改革搬掉了大石头，工资改革改善了我们的生活，我们如不好好生产，真是对不起毛主席，对不起自己的良心。”
    解决产品质量问题的过程，也教育和提高了我们领导干部，使我们更进一步地体会到改造旧企业的过程，是一个解决许多复杂矛盾的过程。在生产发展的复杂过程中，要学习善于发现和抓住主要的矛盾，从解决主要矛盾中，把整个生产工作不断推向前进。在过去我们以民主改革的方法，解决了旧企业遗留下来的封建残余势力与广大职工群众的矛盾。在此次生产改革的过程中，以检查质量的方法，解决了生产多、浪费也多的矛盾。当前还必须解决群众高涨的生产热情与领导上计划不周、业务不熟的矛盾，以便彻底完成生产改革的历史任务，迎接祖国大规模的经济建设。
