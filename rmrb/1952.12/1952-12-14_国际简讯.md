American Monopoly Capital Groups Fear Anti-American Sentiment in Western Europe

Facts prove that America's policy towards Western Europe is one of aggression, a policy of creating death and destruction. Consequently, anti-American sentiment among the people of Western European countries has been rising recently. Even the newspapers of the American monopoly capitalist groups cannot help but notice this. Not long ago, a report from the extremely reactionary "Collier's" magazine's Paris correspondent cited many examples, including British industrialists complaining about Washington's trade restrictions, French farmers dissatisfied with the presence of American troops in France, and a West German student vowing never to serve as mercenaries for American generals... This reporter was shocked by the pervasive anti-American sentiment in Western Europe, and finally discovered the relationship between anti-American sentiment and American "aid," saying: "There are three countries—Britain, France, and West Germany—that we (referring to the United States) aid the most, and where the people oppose us the most intensely."

This shows that even the American imperialists themselves believe that their usual lies about "defending" and "aiding" the people of Western Europe can no longer deceive anyone.

American Troops Behave Recklessly in Oxford, England

The ancient British cultural city of Oxford has become a place for American airmen stationed in Britain to engage in lewd entertainment. An Associated Press report stated that due to the presence of eight thousand American airmen at three American air bases near Oxford, "a large number of prostitutes have flooded into Oxford." According to an American reporter, since the arrival of the American troops in Oxford, seven out of every hundred babies born last year were illegitimate. Every weekend, "hundreds and thousands of American airmen gather on the streets, in cinemas, restaurants, and dance halls of Oxford." These American soldiers boast to the British people about the "American way of life," and their obscene behavior "has greatly shocked some elderly people in Oxford." These American officers and soldiers also often "fight over a girl or get drunk" with the British in bars.

Oxford, in the annals of British classical cultural history, once wrote a glorious page. But now, the disseminators of the "American way of life" are trampling it with bestial hooves.

    美国垄断资本集团惧怕西欧的反美情绪
    事实证明：美国对西欧的政策，是侵略的政策，是制造死亡和毁灭的政策。因而西欧各国人民的反美情绪近来正越来越高涨。这一点连美国垄断资本集团的报刊也不能不注意了。不久前，十分反动的“柯里尔”杂志驻巴黎记者的报道就举了很多例子，其中有英国的工业家抱怨华盛顿的贸易限制政策，法国农民不满美国军队驻在法国，西德一个学生宣誓决不充当美国将军们的雇佣兵……。这位记者对于弥漫西欧的反美情绪震惊不已，最后他还发现了反美情绪和美“援”之间的关系，他说：“有三个国家——英国、法国和西德，我们（指美国）援助的最多，而那里的人民也反对的最激烈。”
    这说明：美帝国主义一向叫嚷的“防御”和“援助”西欧人民的鬼话，就连它们自己也认为骗不了人了。
    美国军队在英国牛津胡作非为
    英国的文化古城牛津已变成美国驻英空军人员淫猥取乐的场合。美联社的一则消息说：由于牛津附近三个美国空军基地到了八千个美国飞行员，“大批妓女已涌进牛津”。据一个美国记者报道：自从美军到了牛津后，去年每一百个出生婴儿中就有七个是私生子。每逢周末，“成千成百的美国飞行员涌集在牛津的大街上，电影院，餐馆和跳舞厅里”。这些美国军人向英国人民夸耀“美国生活方式”，他们的猥亵行为“使得牛津的一些老年人大为震惊”。这些美军官兵也常在酒吧间，和英国人“为了一个姑娘，或者吃醉了酒而大打出手”。
    牛津，在英国古典文化历史的史册上曾经写下了光辉的一页。但是现在，“美国生活方式”的传播者却用兽蹄把它蹂躏了。
