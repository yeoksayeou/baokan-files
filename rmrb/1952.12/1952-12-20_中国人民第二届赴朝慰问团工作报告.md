    The Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea Work Report
    Liu Jingfan, Head of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea
    I
    In order to express the Chinese people's sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people who are fighting heroically in Korea, to encourage them to defend Korea's independence and China's security, to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to oppose the struggle against American imperialist aggression, the Second Delegation to Korea was formed in September this year under the advocacy of the China Peace Committee and then went to the Korean front line to carry out more than a month of consolation work.

    The delegation consisted of 361 representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic groups, families of soldiers and martyrs from various regions, model workers from industry and agriculture, women, youth, students, cultural and educational circles, business circles, religious circles, and overseas Chinese, 563 literary and art workers, and 173 staff members, totaling 1,097 people.

    In addition to the general delegation, the delegation was divided into nine sub-delegations. Except for the Ninth Sub-Delegation, which stayed in the rear to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army, the other eight sub-delegations, starting from October 5, 1952, arrived at the Korean front line one after another, bringing with them the warm concern of the people of the whole country for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, as well as over 1,600 tons of daily necessities for the soldiers and commemorative souvenirs.

    After arriving in Korea, with the assistance of the leadership organs of the Volunteer Army at all levels, the governments of Korea at all levels, and the Korean People's Army, and through the concerted efforts of all the comrades of the delegation for more than 40 days, in the forms of consolation meetings, symposiums, and visits, more than 3,100 meetings of various sizes were held, and the commanders, fighters, political workers, logistics workers, wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, as well as some Korean people, were more generally and deeply comforted. Most of the representatives of the delegation reached the companies and forward positions and met directly with the soldiers. They also went to the tombs of martyrs Yang Gensi, Luo Shengjiao, Yao Qingxiang, etc., to hold memorial services. The cultural and art troupes and film teams performed nearly 3,000 performances of songs, dances, folk arts, acrobatics, Peking opera, Ping opera, and films for the Chinese and Korean soldiers and some Korean people.

    The delegation was warmly welcomed by all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea. Before the delegation arrived, the good news spread throughout the army, and newspapers, magazines, and wall newspapers of various units published news of the delegation's arrival. At the meetings to discuss the reception of the delegation, the soldiers generally proposed the slogan "Guarantee to greet the delegation with victories." In order to ensure the safety of the delegation, they also selected many responsible cadres and heroic drivers to meet them from afar and prepared safe dormitories and good meals. Wherever the delegation went, the soldiers cheered and surrounded the representatives, warmly embracing, shaking hands, and giving souvenirs. Many representatives were even carried up the mountains by the soldiers. They called the delegation representatives "representatives of Chairman Mao and relatives from our hometown." Some soldiers ran from far away to greet the delegation upon hearing of its arrival. They said, "Chairman Mao sent people to see us, and I must see them." They were most concerned about Chairman Mao's health and the construction of the motherland. The first thing they asked upon meeting was how was Chairman Mao's health? How is the construction of the motherland? Fully demonstrating their love for Chairman Mao and the motherland. The delegation was also warmly welcomed by the Korean People's Army and the Korean people. In many places, the Korean people, in order to welcome the arrival of the delegation, wore new clothes and waited on the road for a long time, regardless of rain or night. They also specially prepared food and accommodation for the delegation according to Chinese customs and gave the delegation many commemorative gifts to express their respect and love for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.

    II

    When the delegation arrived at the Korean front line, it was the beginning of the counterattack campaign by the Chinese and Korean people's forces. Because we conveyed to the Chinese People's Volunteers the love of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao's concern, the glorious achievements of the motherland's construction in the past three years, and the news of the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin, their strong morale was even more encouraged. Many soldiers were moved to tears when they heard the love and concern of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland and expressed that they would "fight to the end to defend the construction of the motherland and for the complete victory of the anti-American and aid-Korea cause, and we will never return until we achieve our goal." The forward troops generally proposed to dedicate their victories as a gift. After seeing the delegation, the wounded and sick soldiers all expressed that they "must strive to recover soon and return to the battlefield." The soldiers generally formulated and revised their plans to earn merits and firmly stated that they would add merits to merits and win greater victories in this counterattack campaign to repay the care of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. Their general response to this consolation was "three satisfactions and one happiness": they were satisfied to see the delegation from the people of the motherland, to hear the glorious achievements of the motherland's construction in the past three years, and to receive commemorative souvenirs; they were happy to know that Chairman Mao was in good health. Every souvenir from the people of the motherland played a great role in inspiring the Volunteer Army. For example, the "Pioneer Company" and "Ever-Victorious Company" of a certain army swore to plant the red flag given to them by the delegation on Gaowang Mountain, and they indeed achieved the glorious victory of completely annihilating more than 200 enemy troops and capturing more than 10 enemy troops on Gaowang Mountain in a few minutes in a battle. When a certain anti-aircraft artillery company was fighting in the air, the enemy's shells hit their position, and they encouraged each other, saying, "Stay calm and don't forget the words written on the cigarettes sent by the people of the motherland, 'Attack the American aggressors.'" As a result, they shot down and damaged six enemy planes in one day of fierce fighting. Chairman Mao's portrait became the soldiers' most beloved gift. They put Chairman Mao's portrait in their close-fitting pockets or pasted it at the highest point of the tunnel, believing that this was the power to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy.

    The wide representation of this delegation and the commemorative significance of the souvenirs greatly enhanced the Volunteer Army's sense of honor. They were very moved to see the delegation composed of representatives from all strata, all ethnic groups, and all walks of life coming to comfort them. They were especially moved to see the representatives of minority nationalities, elderly representatives, and female representatives who came from afar regardless of difficulties, and they said, "The delegation was really sent by the people of the whole country." They regarded the handkerchief printed with Chairman Mao's portrait, the enamel teacup printed with the words "Presented to the Most Beloved People," and the pipe engraved with the words "Motherland - My Mother" as the most precious gifts and saved these gifts as permanent souvenirs. Some soldiers have already sent these gifts home as "family heirlooms." The soldiers regarded it as the greatest honor that the people of the motherland called them "the most beloved people." They unanimously stated that they must fight and work hard, to bring glory to Chairman Mao, to bring glory to the people of the motherland, and to always maintain this glorious title. (⑴⑶)

    This consolation also gave us the opportunity to once again convey to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people the Chinese people's concern for them and the determination of the Chinese people to fully assist the Korean people's just struggle. Our visits and consolations further encouraged their confidence in victory and enhanced the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood and flesh. Wherever the delegation went, the Korean People's Army and the Korean people expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people for their assistance and concern with extremely warm, sincere, and cordial attitudes. They said in unison: "The Chinese people extended a helping hand at our most urgent moment and sent their heroic children - the Chinese People's Volunteers - to defend the land and freedom of Korea with blood and flesh. Now they have sent a delegation bringing a large number of souvenirs. The Korean people will never forget this profound friendship, which is rare in the world, for generations to come. We firmly believe that with the assistance of nearly 500 million Chinese people and the support and solidarity of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean people will surely defeat the American aggressors and defend the independence and freedom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." Every contact we had with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people made us deeply feel that the Korean people have a high respect and love for the Chinese people, and the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is eternal and unbreakable.

    All the members of the delegation personally witnessed the high degree of patriotism and internationalism of all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, their unparalleled courage and wisdom, their enthusiasm and creativity in overcoming difficulties, their infinite loyalty to the motherland and Chairman Mao, and their infinite sympathy and love for the Korean people. At the same time, we also saw the heroic spirit of the heroic Korean people and the Korean people who resolutely resisted the American aggressors, the profound hatred they held for the American imperialists who committed all kinds of heinous crimes in Korea, and the spirit of their continuous and heroic struggle regardless of all kinds of difficulties. All of this gave us a profound education in patriotism and internationalism. Each of us has a deeper understanding of the true face of American imperialism, the importance of resisting America and aiding Korea, and the powerful strength and source of the Chinese and Korean people. The high political consciousness of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, their noble revolutionary qualities, and their selfless fighting spirit inspired each of us. Although we left the motherland for a short time, we felt an unusual sense of intimacy and joy whenever we mentioned Chairman Mao and the motherland. After arriving in Korea, we felt even more the greatness and loveliness of the motherland.

    III

    The period when the delegation worked on the Korean front line was just around the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad. In these two years, the heroic Chinese and Korean people's forces have achieved great victories in annihilating more than 660,000 American aggressors and their accomplice troops, shooting down and damaging more than 7,300 enemy planes, and destroying and damaging more than 2,000 enemy tanks, making the front line more stable near the 38th parallel. We personally saw on the front line the fact that our army is becoming stronger and stronger as it fights, and the enemy is losing more and more as it fights. The Korean war situation has undergone new changes, laying the foundation for our final victory. For example, in the counterattack campaign from mid-September to the present, our army has annihilated more than 100,000 enemy troops, including more than 35,000 Americans, and shot down and damaged more than 1,300 enemy planes by ground forces alone. The great victory of this counterattack campaign has made the enemy pay a great price and increased great difficulties.

    The reason why the Chinese and Korean people's forces were able to defeat the American aggressor group with superior equipment with inferior equipment and achieve the above-mentioned great victory is, in addition to the support of the Chinese and Korean people and the assistance and sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world, what we have learned most deeply on the front line is that the war they are waging is a just war against aggression, so they all have a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Taking the Volunteer Army as an example, the soldiers generally and deeply realize that their struggle represents the wishes of the people of the motherland and the peace-loving people all over the world, and it is a great and glorious task to defend the security of the motherland, to help the Korean people defend the independence and freedom of their nation, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. Their struggle is not only supported by the people of the whole country, but also has the sympathy and assistance of peace-loving people all over the world, so their morale is very strong and their fighting will is very firm. In the struggle with the enemy, they showed unparalleled courage and wisdom and showed earth-shattering revolutionary heroism and selflessness. In the past two years, tens of thousands of meritorious people have emerged in the Volunteer Army, including many glorious heroes and models. For example, in the recent famous Battle of Shangganling, the resourceful and brave soldier Yi Caixue used grenades, hand grenades, and 60mm mortar shells to continuously blow up three enemy group firepower points, destroying seven enemy heavy machine guns and five light machine guns; a certain unit's communication soldier - the hero in the style of Matrosov - Huang Jiguang, threw himself on the enemy's fortifications and blocked the muzzle of the machine gun that the enemy was firing, allowing his comrades to successfully rush to the top of the mountain. In short, "earn merits for resisting America and aiding Korea and defending the country," "earn merits for the people of the motherland," and "earn merits for defending the cause of world peace" have become mass movements in the entire army in the front. Everywhere in Korea, we heard such confident, optimistic, firm, and sincere heroic voices: "Please rest assured, people of the motherland!" "We will definitely answer the care of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland with greater victories." On the contrary, the morale of the American mercenaries and other invading troops who sold their lives for Wall Street is declining day by day, and the sentiments of war-weariness and anti-war are rising day by day, and the number of people who voluntarily surrender is increasing day by day. For example, the soldiers of the American invading army most like to collect the surrender safety certificates distributed by our army and use the fact that they have obtained the surrender safety certificates to "comfort" their mothers and wives who are thousands of miles away. The enemy's officers, in order to "save" their deteriorating morale, even came up with the whimsical idea: "Whoever can grab a wounded soldier from the front line can exchange it for a week's vacation." As a result, the American soldiers who were eager to escape the war competed with each other for the wounded soldiers, and some soldiers lost their lives because of this.

    We have personally seen that our army's equipment has been greatly improved, its firepower has been greatly strengthened, its combat skills have been greatly improved, and new arms are constantly growing and becoming stronger. Our army's equipment and firepower have been strengthened to such an extent that even the enemy cannot but admit: "The Chinese army's artillery fire is fiercely concentrated and has begun to dominate the battle." At present, our army has a growing air force, armored force, and a powerful artillery force, and new arms have been tempered in actual combat, and their technology is constantly improving. The equipment of the infantry has also been generally strengthened, the combat experience is becoming increasingly rich, and the combat skills have also been further improved. The cold gun and cold artillery movement, which has been developed due to the continuous improvement of our army's shooting skills, has also caused heavier blows to the enemy. The heroic sniper Wei Qingling created a record of killing and wounding 101 enemy troops alone in 57 days.

    We have also personally seen that the Chinese and Korean people's forces have displayed unparalleled wisdom and creativity, and with selfless hard work, have built steel-like, deeply equipped fortifications from the Imjin River to the east coast, on a defense line of more than 400 kilometers from east to west. Relying on such solid fortifications, the soldiers not only preserved themselves but also killed and wounded a large number of enemies, completely stabilized the front line, and created favorable conditions for both offense and defense. For example, in the recent famous Battle of Shangganling north of Jinhua, the enemy suffered heavy losses of more than 20,000 people and more than 200 planes in the face of our army's solid fortifications and finally failed to advance north. The Battle of Shangganling once again proved that our army's solid fortifications can withstand the enemy's fierce artillery fire.

    We have also personally seen that our army has created a transportation force suitable for modern warfare. Thanks to their courage and resourcefulness, they have overcome the enemy's crazy bombing and destruction and gained rich experience, greatly improving our army's transportation and supply, not only fully ensuring the supply of ammunition, food, and clothing to the front, but also providing the front troops with a large number of daily necessities and cultural and entertainment equipment. Taking the soldiers' winter clothing this year as an example, it only took three days to transport all of them to the front. The soldiers' lives have been greatly improved compared to the past, and they generally have fine grains, meat, and hot dishes and meals. The soldiers' cultural and entertainment activities and the movement to eliminate illiteracy are also flourishing in the gaps between battles. The soldiers' sanitation movement has also achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, from the anti-bacterial warfare to the end of July this year, the entire army has caught more than 2.93 million rats, eliminated more than 934 million flies, and eliminated an even greater number of mosquitoes, fleas, and other insects; built more than 70,000 toilets, more than 20,000 wells, more than 15,000 bathhouses, and more than 2,500 insect-killing rooms and isolation rooms. As a result, diseases have been greatly reduced, and the level of health has been greatly improved.

    We have personally seen the fact that the Volunteer Army and the Korean people are completely integrated. The Volunteer Army loves the Korean people, and the Korean people love the Volunteer Army. Our Volunteer Army not only defends the Korean people with blood and life but also cares very much about the lives of the Korean people and cherishes every blade of grass and tree of the Korean people. They help the Korean people produce and overcome difficulties, demonstrating a high degree of internationalism in sharing life and death with the Korean people. This year, when the American aggressors brought famine to the Korean people, threatening them with starvation, the Volunteer Army saved more than 7.3 million catties of grain from its own rations to relieve the Korean people during the most difficult period from spring to summer. They also helped the Korean people cultivate more than 130,000 mu of land, delivered 450,000 dan of manure, built more than 100 canals (more than 100,000 meters in total length), built more than 40 dams, and planted more than 5 million trees. Because of this, the Volunteer Army has been sincerely loved by the Korean people in Korea. The heroic Korean people also support the Volunteer Army with unparalleled enthusiasm, which has greatly increased the strength of the Volunteer Army in combat.

    IV

    At present, the Korean War is still continuing. We have personally seen that the American aggressors are still continuing to destroy and bomb the peaceful cities and villages of Korea and continue to massacre the peaceful residents of Korea. After suffering a shameful defeat on the battlefield, American imperialism was forced to accept the armistice negotiations, but in the negotiations, it used various despicable means to obstruct and sabotage the armistice negotiations and continued to carry out barbaric acts such as germ warfare, gas warfare, indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents, and massacre of prisoners of war, all of which prove that it has no sincerity for peace. In October this year, the US representative stubbornly refused to accept the new proposal we put forward for the fair and reasonable repatriation of all prisoners of war. It unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment and suspended the Korean armistice negotiations. At the recent UN General Assembly, the US government unreasonably rejected the Soviet delegation's fair proposal on the Korean armistice. All of this more clearly exposes the American aggressors' sinister plot to obstruct and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and attempt to continue to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea. Therefore, the people of the whole country must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance and must not be the slightest bit slack because the front has already achieved great victories. On the contrary, we must regard the work of resisting America and aiding Korea as a long-term task that is as important as economic construction and closely integrate it with economic, cultural, and other construction work, continue to deepen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and provide more powerful assistance to the front, so that the Chinese and Korean people's forces can inflict greater blows on the American aggressors and their accomplices, completely smash the enemy's plot to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea, and strive for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue. Although the lives of our Volunteer Army in the front have been significantly improved, the lives of the soldiers are of course still difficult, and they need continuous spiritual and material assistance from the people of the whole country. In order to further deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea and strive for the complete victory of the Korean War, we hope that the people of the whole country will do the following things well in the future:

    (1) Deepen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea by one step, conduct a comprehensive inspection and revision of the patriotic production increase and thrift plan, and further carry out the patriotic production increase and thrift movement, strengthen national defense construction and economic construction, and use the motherland's increasingly strong economic strength and national defense strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    (2) Frequently comfort and carefully care for the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army recuperating in the rear, effectively improve the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers in the rear, and in conjunction with the upcoming army support movement, earnestly check the placement and care of the families of the Volunteer Army, properly solve their practical difficulties, and frequently write comfort letters with specific and vivid content to our most beloved people - the Chinese People's Volunteers, and tell them at any time about the construction of the motherland in all aspects that they are most concerned about, and pay attention to helping the frontline personnel solve various practical difficulties in a timely manner.

    (3) Universally and deeply carry out the movement to learn from the Chinese People's Volunteers throughout the country, learn their infinite loyalty to the motherland, learn their infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao, learn their high degree of patriotism and internationalism, learn their spirit of heroic struggle and unyielding, learn their spirit of perseverance, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for creation, so that we can more actively and more enthusiastically participate in all the work needed by the motherland, to welcome large-scale economic construction and cultural construction.

    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团工作报告
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团总团长  刘景范
    一
    中国人民为了慰问在朝鲜英勇奋斗的中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，鼓舞他们保卫朝鲜的独立和中国的安全、保卫远东和世界的和平、反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争意见，在中国人民抗美援朝总会的倡导下，在今年九月间组成了第二届赴朝慰问团，随即前往朝鲜前线进行了一个多月的慰问工作。
    慰问团由全国各民主党派、各人民团体、人民解放军、各民族、以及各地区的军属烈属、工农劳动模范、妇女、青年、学生、文教界、工商界、宗教界和海外华侨的代表共三百六十一人，文艺工作者五百六十三人和工作人员一百七十三人，共计一千零九十七人组成。
    慰问团除总团外，分组了九个分团。其中除第九分团留在后方慰问志愿军的伤病员外，其他八个分团，从一九五二年十月五日起，带着全国人民对中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军热烈关怀的心情和千六余吨战士生活需要并具有纪念意义的慰问品，先后到达朝鲜前线。
    到达朝鲜之后，在志愿军各级领导机关、朝鲜各级政府和朝鲜人民军的协助下，经本团全体同志四十多天的一致努力，采取慰问大会、座谈会和访问等形式，共开大小会三千一百多次，比较普遍深入地慰问了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、伤病员以及一部分朝鲜人民。慰问团的代表们大都到达了连队和前沿阵地，直接和战士们见了面。并分别到过烈士杨根思、罗盛教、姚庆祥等坟前举行了扫墓仪式。文工团和电影队为中、朝战士们和部分朝鲜人民演出了近三千场歌舞、曲艺、杂技、京剧、评剧和电影。
    慰问团在朝鲜受到了中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员非常热烈的欢迎。在慰问团未到之前，喜讯即传遍全军，各单位的报纸、刊物、墙报都登载着慰问团要来的消息。在讨论迎接慰问团的会议上，战士们普遍提出“保证以打胜仗来迎接慰问团”的口号。他们为了照顾慰问团的安全，还选派了许多负责干部及英雄驾驶员远道相接，并准备了安全的宿舍和好的膳食。慰问团所到之处，战士们一片欢呼声，把代表包围起来，亲切地拥抱、握手和送纪念品，甚至有不少的代表被战士们抬上山去。他们把慰问团代表称为“毛主席的代表，咱们家乡的亲人”。有些战士听到慰问团到来，从很远的地方跑来迎接。他们说：“毛主席派人看咱们来了，我一定要见他们一面。”他们最关心的是毛主席的身体健康状况，和祖国建设情况，见面首先是询问毛主席身体如何？祖国建设怎样？充分表现了他们对毛主席和祖国的热爱。在朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民当中，慰问团也同样受到了热烈的欢迎。不少地方的朝鲜人民，为迎接慰问团的到来，不论在雨天或夜晚，都穿着新衣，在公路上等候好久。他们还特别为慰问团按照中国习惯准备了食宿，并赠给慰问团许多具有纪念意义的礼物，来表示他们对毛主席和中国人民的敬爱。
    二
    当慰问团到达朝鲜前线的时候，正是中、朝人民部队反击战役开始的时候。由于我们向中国人民志愿军传达了祖国人民的热爱和毛主席的关怀，传达了祖国三年来建设的辉煌成就和即将开始大规模经济建设的消息，因而更加鼓舞了他们旺盛的士气。许多战士听到毛主席和祖国人民的热爱和关怀，感动的流下热泪，纷纷表示：“为保卫祖国的建设事业，为抗美援朝的彻底胜利而奋斗到底，不达目的，誓不回国。”前沿部队普遍提出以打胜仗作为献礼。伤病员见到慰问团以后都表示：“要争取早日痊愈，重上战场。”战士们普遍地制订了修订了立功计划，坚决表示要功上加功，在这次反击战役中获得更大胜利，来报答祖国人民和毛主席的关怀。他们对这次慰问普遍的反映是“三满意一高兴”，满意的是：见到了祖国人民慰问团，听到了祖国三年来建设的辉煌成就，得到了具有纪念意义的慰问品；高兴的是：知道了毛主席身体健康。祖国人民的每件慰问品对志愿军都起了很大的鼓舞作用。如某军的“先锋连”和“常胜连”，宣誓要把慰问团赠给他们的红旗插上高旺山，他们果然在一次战斗中，在几分钟之内，就获得了全歼高旺山守敌二百多名、俘敌十余名的光辉胜利。某部高射炮连在对空作战时，敌人的炮弹打在他们阵地上，他们互相鼓励说：“沉着气，不要忘掉祖国人民送来的香烟上写的话‘打击美国侵略者’。”结果在一天的激烈战斗中击落击伤敌机六架。毛主席的像片成为战士们最心爱的礼物，他们把毛主席的像片装在贴身的衣袋里，成贴在坑道的最高处，认为这样就是克服困难、战胜敌人的力量。
    这次慰问团代表性的广泛和慰问品的具有纪念意义，大大提高了志愿军的荣誉感。他们看到由各阶层、各民族、各界人士的代表所组成的慰问团来慰问，很受感动。尤其看到了不避艰险、远道而来的少数民族代表、年老代表和女代表，更使他们感动，他们说：“慰问团真是全国人民派来的。”他们对于印有毛主席像的手帕、印有“赠给最可爱的人”字样的搪磁茶缸和刻有“祖国——我的母亲”字样的烟斗，视为最珍贵的礼物，并且把这些礼物保存起来留为永久纪念。有的战士已将这些礼物寄回家中，作为“传家之宝”。战士们对祖国人民称他们为“最可爱的人”，认为是最大的荣誉。他们一致表示：一定要好好地战斗和工作，为毛主席增光，为祖国人民增光，永远保持这个光荣称号。（⑴⑶）
    这次慰问也使我们获得机会向英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，再一次传达中国人民对他们的关怀，传达中国人同以全力援助朝鲜人民正义斗争的决心。我们的拜访和慰问，更加鼓舞了他们的胜利信心，增进了中、朝人民以血肉凝结成了战斗的友谊。慰问团所到之处，朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民都以极热烈、极诚恳和极亲切的态度感谢中国人民对他们的援助和关怀。他们异口同声地说：“中国人民在我们最紧急的关头，伸出援助之手，派遣了自己的英雄儿女——中国人民志愿军，以血肉来保卫朝鲜的土地和自由，现在又派慰问团带来大量的慰问品，这种举世稀有的深厚友情，朝鲜人民是子孙万代、永世也不能忘记的。我们坚决相信有了中国近五亿人民的援助，和苏联以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持与声援，朝鲜人民一定能够战胜美国侵略者，保卫朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立和自由。”我们和朝鲜人民军部队及朝鲜人民群众的每一次接触，都使我们深深地感觉到朝鲜人民对中国人民怀着崇高的敬爱，中、朝两国人民的战斗友谊是永远的，牢不可破的。
    慰问团的全体人员，亲眼看到了中国人民志愿军全体指战员的高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，看到了他们无比的勇敢和智慧；看到了他们克服困难的积极性和创造性；看到了他们对于祖国、对于毛主席的无限忠诚，和对于朝鲜人民的无限同情和热爱。同时，我们也看到了英雄的朝鲜人民国和朝鲜人民坚决反抗美国侵略者的不屈不挠的英雄气概，看到了他们对于在朝鲜制造了种种万恶罪行的美帝国主义者所抱的深刻仇恨，看到了他们不顾一切艰难困苦仍能前仆后继、英勇奋斗的精神。所有这一切，使我们受到了一次深刻的爱国主义和国际主义的教育，我们每个人都更深刻地认识了美国帝国主义的真面目，认识了抗美援朝的重要性，认识了中朝两国人民的强大力量及其泉源。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的高度政治觉悟，他们的崇高的革命品质和忘我的斗争精神，感召着我们每一个人。我们离开祖国的时间虽然很短，但一提到毛主席，一提到祖国，我们就有一种异样的亲切和愉快的感觉。到了朝鲜以后，我们更加感到祖国的伟大和可爱。

    慰问团在朝鲜前线工作的期间，恰是中国人民志愿军出国作战两周年的前后。在这两年当中，英雄的中、朝人民部队已获得歼灭美国侵略者及其帮凶军六十六万余人、击落击伤敌机七千三百余架、击毁击伤敌人坦克两千余辆的伟大胜利，使战线在三八线附近更加稳定起来。我们在前线亲眼看到了我军愈战愈坚强、敌人愈战愈失利的事实。朝鲜战局已经发生了新的变化，为我们奠定了最后胜利的基础。如我军由九月中旬到现在为止的反击战中，共歼灭了敌军过十万人，其中美国三万五千余人，仅地面部队就击落与击伤敌机一千三百余架。这一反击战的伟大胜利，使敌人付出了很大的代价，增加了很大的困难。
    中、朝人民部队所以能够以劣势的装备，战胜了优势装备的美国侵略集团，取得上述伟大胜利，其原因除由于中、朝人民的支持及全世界爱好和平人民的援助和同情之外，我们在前线体会最深者，是由于他们进行的战争是正义的反侵略战争，因而他们都具有高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神。拿志愿军来说，战士们普遍而深刻地认识到他们的斗争是代表着祖国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，是保卫祖国的安全，援助朝鲜人民保卫他们民族的独立和自由，保卫远东和世界和平的伟大光荣的任务。他们的斗争不但有全国人民的支援，而且有全世界爱好和平人民的同情和援助，因而士气非常旺盛，战斗意志非常坚强。他们在和敌人斗争中，表现了无比的勇敢和智慧，表现了惊天动地的革命英雄主义和忘我的精神。两年来志愿军中涌现出来十几万个功臣，其中有很多光辉的英雄和模范。如最近有名的上甘岭战斗中，智勇双全的战士易才学，一个人用手雷、手榴弹和六○炮弹，就连续爆破了敌人三个集团火力点，炸毁了敌人七挺重机枪和五挺轻机枪；某部通记战士——马特洛索夫式的英雄——黄继光，用自己的身体扑到敌人的工事去，堵住了敌人正在发射的机关枪的枪眼，让他的战友们顺利地冲上山头。总之，“为抗美援朝、保家卫国立功”，“为祖国人民立功”，“为保卫世界和平事业立功”，在前方已经成为全军群众性的运动了。我们在朝鲜到处听到了这样自信、乐观、坚定、恳切的英雄的声音：“请祖国人民放心！”“我们一定以更大的胜利来回答毛主席和祖国人民的关怀。”相反的，为华尔街卖命的美国雇佣兵和其他侵略军的士气，则一天比一天消沉，厌战、反战的情绪一天比一天高涨，自动投降的人数一天比一天增多。例如：美国侵略军的士兵最爱收藏我军散发的投降安全证，用得到投降安全证的事实来“安慰”他们万里迢迢的母亲和妻子。敌人的军官们，为了“挽救”其每况愈下的士气，竟异想天开地提出：“谁能从火线上抢下一个伤员，谁就可以换取一周的休假。”于是急愿逃避战争的美国士兵们，一遇见伤员便互相争夺，有些作员反因此而丧命。
    我们亲眼看到了我军的装备已经大大改善，火力已经大大加强，作战技术已经大大提高，新的兵种正在不断地成长壮大。我军的装备和火力已经加强到这样的程度，连敌人都不能不承认：“中国军队的大炮炮火猛烈集中，已开始在战斗中占优势了。”目前我军已有了日益壮大的空军、装甲部队和强大的炮兵部队，新的兵种已经在实际战斗中得到了锻炼，技术不断地提高。步兵的装备也普遍地加强了，战斗经验日益丰富，战斗技术也更加提高了。由于我军射击技术不断提高在而发展起来的冷枪冷炮运动，也使敌人遭到更沉重的打击。英雄的狙击手魏庆陵在五十七天中，一个人就创造了毙伤敌军一百零一名的纪录。
    我们又亲眼看到了，中、朝人民部队发挥了无比的智慧和创造性，以忘我的辛勤劳动，从临津江到东海岸，在东西四百多公里防线上构筑了钢铁般的、具有纵深配备的工事。战士们依托这样紧固的工事，不仅保存了自己，并且大量地杀伤敌人，把战线完全稳定下来，并且造成了能攻能守的有利条件。如最近有名的金化以北上甘岭的战斗，敌人在我军紧固工事面前，遭受了两万多人和二百多架飞机的惨重损失，终于不能北进。上甘岭战斗再一次地证明了我军的坚强工事可以抵御敌人猛烈的炮火。
    我们还亲眼看到了，我军已经创造了适合现代化战争的运输部队，由于他们的勇敢机智，战胜了敌人的疯狂轰炸与破坏，取得了丰富的经验，使我军的运输供应得到极大的改善，不但充分地保证了前方弹药、粮食和被服的供给，而且还使前线部队得到大量的日用品和文化娱乐用具。仅以今年战士的冬装为例，只用了三天的时间，即全部运到前线。战士们的生活比过去已经有很大的改善，普遍做到有细粮、有肉食、有热菜热饭吃的情况。战士的文化娱乐活动和消灭文盲运动，也在战斗的间隙中蓬勃地开展着。战士们卫生运动也收到了很大的效果。据不完全统计，自反细菌战以来到今年七月底，全军共捕鼠二百九十三万多只，消灭苍蝇九亿三千四百多只，消灭的蚊虫、跳蚤及其他昆虫数量更大；修建了厕所七万余所，水井二万余个，澡堂一万五千余所，灭虫室、隔离室二千五百余所。因此，疾病大为减少，健康水平大为提高。
    我们亲眼看到了志愿军和朝鲜人民完全水乳交融的事实。志愿军热爱朝鲜人民，朝鲜人民热爱志愿军。我们的志愿军不仅用鲜血和生命保卫着朝鲜人民，而且十分关心朝鲜人民的生活，爱护朝鲜人民一草一木。他们帮助朝鲜人民生产和克服困难，表现了和朝鲜人民同生死、共患难的高度国际主义精神。今年，当美国侵略者给朝鲜人民带来饥馑，使朝鲜人民遭受到饥饿的威胁时，从春季到夏季最艰难的一段时间，志愿军从自己的给养中，节约了七百三十多万斤粮食救济朝鲜人民，还帮助朝鲜人民耕地十三万多亩，送粪四十五万担，修水渠一百多条（全长十万多公尺），筑坝四十多处，种树五百多万株。正因为这样，志愿军在朝鲜受到了朝鲜人民衷心的爱戴。英雄朝鲜人民，也同样以无比的热情支援着志愿军，使志愿军在战斗中增加了很大的力量。

    目前朝鲜战争仍在继续进行，我们亲眼看到美国侵略者仍在继续破坏、轰炸朝鲜的和平城市和乡村，继续屠杀朝鲜的和平居民。美帝国主义在战场上遭到可耻的失败后，被迫接受了停战谈判，但在谈判中却用各种卑鄙手段阻挠与破坏停战谈判，并继续进行野蛮的细菌战、毒气战、滥炸和平居民、屠杀战俘等罪恶行为，这都证明它毫无和平诚意。在今年十月间，美方代表竟蛮横地拒绝接受我们所提出公平合理遣返全部战俘的新建议。片面宣布无限期休会，中止朝鲜停战谈判。在最近联合国大会上，美国政府又无理地拒绝了苏联代表团关于朝鲜停战的公正建议。这一切更清楚地暴露了美国侵略者阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，企图继续延长和扩大侵朝战争的罪恶阴谋。因此，全国人民必须继续保持着高度的警惕，不能因前线已经获得了伟大的胜利而有丝毫松懈。相反的，我们必须把抗美援朝的工作看作是长期的与经济建设同等重要的工作，并与经济、文化等建设工作密切地结合起来，继续深入抗美援朝工作，更有力地援助前线，使中、朝人民部队给美国侵略者及其帮凶以更大的打击，彻底粉碎敌人延长和扩大侵朝战争的阴谋，争取朝鲜问题最后获得公平合理的解决。前线我志愿军的生活虽然已有了显著的改善，但是，战士的生活当然还是艰苦的，需要全国人民不断地给他们以精神上和物质上的帮助。为了进一步深入抗美援朝运动，争取朝鲜战争的彻底胜利，我们希望全国人民今后做好以下几个件工作：
    （一）把抗美援朝工作深入一步，普遍检查和修订爱国增产节约计划，并且更进一步地开展爱国增产节约运动，加强国防建设和经济建设，用祖国日益增强的经济力量和国防力量，来支援中国人民志愿军。
    （二）经常地慰问和细心地照顾在后方休养的志愿军伤病员，切实改善后方拥军优属的工作，结合即将开始的拥军运动，认真检查对志愿军家属的安置和照顾，妥善地解决他们的切身困难，经常给我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军写有具体生动内容的慰问信，随时告诉他们最关怀的祖国各方面的建设情况，并且注意及时帮助前线人员解决各种具体困难。
    （三）在全国范围内普遍和深入地展开向中国人民志愿军学习的运动，学习他们对祖国的无限忠诚，学习他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，学习他们高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，学习他们英勇奋斗坚强不掘的精神，学习他们坚忍不拔、克服一切困难和努力创造的精神，从而使我们更加积极地、更加热情地参加祖国所需要的一切工作，来迎接大规模的经济建设和文化建设。
