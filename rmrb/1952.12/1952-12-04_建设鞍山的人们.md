The People Building Anshan

　　On the vast construction site of Anshan, the scene of tens of thousands of workers selflessly laboring for the construction of the motherland shows that in our heroic country, there are not only first-class soldiers defending the motherland, but also first-class workers building the motherland.

　　We visited Wang Jinzhong, a famous Anshan labor model, and his concrete pouring team. They learned the Soviet Union's cyclic flow operation method and grouting method, coupled with courageous labor, the labor efficiency increased by an average of 136 percent, but also to ensure first-class quality. A universal loading and unloading machine operator told us about the work of this engineering team pouring concrete: One night, when the work started, they launched a competition with our universal loading and unloading machine operator. That night was really fierce, they were bare-chested, sweat flowed from their heads to their heels, one step a sweat print, they also shouted in their mouths: "Can not let the universal loading and unloading machine catch up with us." Our universal loading and unloading machine operator opened up the horsepower to transport, from ten minutes a trip, shortened to six minutes a trip, still can not catch up with them. That night, fifty-two of them, in seven hours, poured one hundred and forty-one cubic meters of concrete, exceeding the Ministry of Industry quota of four times.

　　This kind of labor enthusiasm like a raging fire is precisely the Anshan working class's love of construction, love of the motherland's performance. When we visited the heroes Wang Hongfa, Meng Qingguo, Yuan Youren, Qin Guoren, Wang Hongchen and Dong Qifan, who had risked their lives to rescue the column pit, this impression became even stronger. On the night of June 19 this year, while the workers were working intensely, there was a sudden crackling sound in the construction site. It turned out that the leader of the No. 11 column pit, Wang Shoushan, had not followed the instructions of the Soviet experts, and had not braced the horizontal bands every 1.5 meters of excavation, but only braced two horizontal bands at the beginning, and then stopped bracing them. As a result, when excavated to eight meters deep, the surrounding soil piled down, and the two horizontal bands above could not hold up, and began to crack, if this column pit collapsed, the entire frame would also collapse. Communist Party member Wang Hongfa, Communist Youth League member Meng Qingguo, Yuan Youren, Wang Hongchen, Qin Guoren and Dong Qifan, hearing that the column pit was about to collapse, rushed to rescue. Wang Hongfa took the lead in jumping into the pit, and several people used various remedial measures to finally save the column pit. Did they not know the danger of rescuing the column pit and the importance of their own lives? No, it was just because they knew that the country's construction was even more important. Meng Qingguo told us: "I am an only child, without me, my father would not be able to live. However, thinking that after the factory is built, our country will be stronger and our lives will be happier, I do not care about anything." These words are very simple, but this is precisely the thinking of all the workers in Anshan, this thinking is to dedicate everything for the motherland.

　　There was also a young peasant named Zhang Deshan, when he came to Anshan from the countryside, he heard that the earlier the country's industrialization, the happier our lives would be, therefore, his enthusiasm was particularly great. At that time, the construction site was rushing to excavate 17,000 cubic meters of earthwork, at the beginning, he found that the shovel was not easy to use, affecting the progress of the project. And the shovels they used to build dams in the countryside in the past, one could top five here. He asked the project captain for a day off and ran more than a hundred miles overnight to carry back more than thirty shovels. Due to the role of these new tools, coupled with everyone's efforts, the earthwork task of this construction site was completed three days ahead of schedule, creating favorable conditions for the large-scale pouring of concrete in September.

　　On another construction site, we also met a young worker: a sturdy body, a red face, his name is Wang Jixian. Wang Jixian used to work on the salt flats by the sea in Yingkou, this year, after the large-scale construction of Anshan began, he automatically signed up to come to Anshan to work. As soon as he arrived at the construction site, he saw such a vast scene, and immediately fell in love with Anshan, and made up his mind: if Anshan is not built well, he will never go home. When he came to Anshan not long ago, his family sent a letter urging him to go back to get married, he had been unwilling to go back, his family had no way, in October this year, they sent the girl to Anshan to marry him. He said: "Why do I not go home? I am now building a large factory, the first large factory in China, with this factory, the country can build more railways, can build more factories, before this factory is not built well, how can I go back!"

　　Everyone knows that the life of basic construction workers is very hard. For example, between July and August this year, the number of basic construction workers in Anshan suddenly increased by tens of thousands, because there were too few houses, many workers had to live in small mat sheds built on the grass, but this did not reduce their enthusiasm for building the motherland. One night in the autumn of this year, we and the director of the political department of a construction site went to the workers' dormitory to visit them, it was time to rest, but many workers were swatting mosquitoes and discussing the work for the next day in a meeting. We said: "So tired during the day, you should rest early!" A worker disagreed and asked us: "We are tired, we are bitter, how about the volunteers? Mosquitoes are powerful, but not as powerful as shells, right!" Our workers, are like this, taking the heroic warriors of our front line as their example. There was also an incident in early winter last year. At that time, the water had formed a thin layer of ice, the group leader Ma Guirong and the whole group of excavating workers accepted a temporary emergency task assigned by the project captain to dig a column base in five days. At that time, water pumps and boots had not been bought, and it was very difficult to work, but Ma Guirong led the workers, jumped into the water nearly one meter deep, and began to dig in the column pit that had formed a thin layer of ice. At that time, the people standing around were very worried for them, the water was so deep, and it was frozen, if they were not careful, there would be danger. However, they were working in the water while saying: "This is far from the volunteers wading through the icy river, climbing the snow mountains, and guarding the hilltops!" They completed the five-day task in one day.

　　Similar examples are countless in Anshan. We can see how strong the will of the workers in Anshan is, how heroic their actions are, and how beautiful their ideals are. They are very ordinary, very ordinary people, but, like our soldiers, they are truly heroes worthy of our glory and pride.

### 建设鞍山的人们

　　建设鞍山的人们
    在规模浩大的鞍山工地上，成千上万的工人们为祖国建设而忘我劳动的情景，显示了在我们英雄的国度里，不仅有着保卫祖国的第一流的战士，而且也有着第一流的工人，来建设祖国。
    我们曾访问了著名鞍山的劳动模范王进忠和他的混凝土浇灌工程队。他们学习了苏联的循环流水作业法和滚浆法，再加上奋勇的劳动，劳动效率平均提高了百分之一百三十六，还保证了一等质量。一个万能装卸机手向我们讲述这个工程队浇灌混凝土的工作情形时说：有一个晚上，工作一开始，他们就和我们万能装卸机手展开竞赛。那天晚上干的真凶，他们光着膀子，汗从头上流到脚跟，一步一个汗印，他们嘴里还喊着：“不能让万能装卸机赶上咱们。”我们万能装卸机手开足马力运送，由十分钟一趟，缩短到六分钟一趟，还是赶不上他们。这天晚上他们五十二个人，在七小时内，浇灌了一百四十一立方公尺的混凝土，超过工业部定额的四倍。
    这种像烈火一样的劳动热情，正是鞍山工人阶级热爱建设、热爱祖国的表现。当我们访问了曾经冒着生命危险、抢救柱坑的英雄王宏发、孟庆国、原友仁、秦国恩、王宏臣和董其范等工人的时候，这种印象就更加强烈。今年六月十九日的夜间，工人们正在紧张工作的时候，忽然工地里喀吧喀吧的一阵响。原来是十一号柱坑的领工员王寿山，未按照苏联专家的指示，在每挖出一公尺五的土方时，即撑上横带，而只是在一开始时撑了两个横带，以后就不撑了。结果挖到八公尺深的时候，四周的土便往下堆，上面的两个横带吃不住劲，开始裂缝了，这个柱坑一塌，整个房架也就要塌下来。共产党员王宏发、青年团员孟庆国、原友仁、王宏臣、秦国恩和董其范，听到柱坑要塌，都赶来抢救。王宏发带头跳下坑去，几个人用了各种补救办法，使这个柱坑终于得救了。他们是不是不知道抢救柱坑的危险和自己生命的重要呢？不是的，只不过是因为他们知道国家的建设更为重要罢了。孟庆国对我们说：“我是一个独子，没有我，我父亲就不能生活。可是，想到工厂建设起来以后，我们国家就会更加强大，我们生活就会更加幸福的时候，我什么也就不顾了。”这话说的很简单，但这却正是鞍山全体工人的思想，这个思想便是为祖国不惜献出自己的一切。
    还有一个青年农民叫张德山，他从农村到鞍山的时候，听说国家工业化越早，我们的生活就更幸福，因此，他的干劲特别大。当时工地里正在抢挖一万七千立方公尺的土方，一开始，他就发现铁锹不好使，影响工程的进度。而他们过去在农村里打坝用的铁锹，一个能顶这里的五个。他就向工程队长请了一天假，连夜跑了一百多里路，背回三十多把铁锹来。由于这些新工具的作用，再加上大家的努力，这个工地的土方任务，提前三天完成了，为九月份大规模的浇灌混凝土创造了有利的条件。
    在另一个工地上，我们还遇到了一个青年工人：结实的身体，红红的脸蛋，他的名字叫王继先。王继先过去在营口海边的盐滩上工作，今年鞍山大规模的建设开始后，自动报名前来鞍山工作。一到工地，他看见了这样规模浩大的场面，就立刻爱上了鞍山，并下了决心：不把鞍山建设好，绝不回家。当他来到鞍山不久，他家就来信催他回去结婚，他一直不愿回去，他家没有办法，在今年十月，便把姑娘送到鞍山来和他结了婚。他说：“我为啥不回家呢？我现在正在建设一座大工厂，全中国的第一个大工厂，有了这个工厂，全国就能修更多的铁道，就能造更多的工厂，这个工厂没有建设好以前，我怎能回去呀！”
    谁都知道基本建设工人的生活是很苦的。譬如今年七、八月间，鞍山基本建设工人突增数万，因为房子太少，许多工人便不得不住在草地上搭起的小席棚里，但是，这并没有丝毫减低他们建设祖国的热情。今年秋天的一个夜里，我们和一个工地政治处主任，到工人宿舍去看望他们，那已是该休息的时候，可是，许多工人一面赶着蚊子，一面在开会研究第二天的工作。我们说：“白天那么累，应该早休息了吧！”有一个工人不以为然地反问我们道：“我们累，我们苦，比志愿军怎样？蚊子厉害，总不比炮弹吧！”我们的工人们，就是这样以我们前线的英雄勇士作为自己的榜样。去年初冬还有一件事情。那时水已结了薄冰，小组长马桂荣和全组挖土工人，接受工程队长分配的一项临时紧急任务，要在五天内挖好一个柱基。那时水泵、皮靴都没有买到，工作起来困难很多，可是马桂荣率领着工人们，跳进水深近一公尺，并在已结了薄冰的柱坑中，开始挖了起来。当时，站在周围的人都很替他们耽心，水那样深，又结了冰，一不小心，就会发生危险的。但是，他们在水里一边干一边还说：“这比起志愿军趟冰河、爬雪山、守山头，还差得远呢！”他们就这样以一天的时间，完成了五天的任务。
    类似这样的事例，在鞍山是举不胜举的。我们可以看出，鞍山工人们的意志是多么的坚强，他们的行动是多么的英雄，他们理想又是多么的美丽。他们是很普通、很平凡的人，可是，他们也像我们的战士一样，是真正值得我们引为光荣和骄傲的英雄。
