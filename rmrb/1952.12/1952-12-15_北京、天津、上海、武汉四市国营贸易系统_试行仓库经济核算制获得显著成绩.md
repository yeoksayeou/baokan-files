The state-owned trading systems of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan have achieved significant results in the trial implementation of the warehouse economic accounting system.

	Improved warehouse utilization rate, beginning to overcome problems such as unclear accounts and goods, slow delivery, and chaotic procedures.

The state-owned trading systems in the four major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan have been piloting a warehouse economic accounting system since September, and have achieved initial results.

All pilot units have clarified warehouse capacity and improved warehouse utilization. After on-site measurements, the total area of ​​freight yards of various state-owned trading companies in Tianjin increased by more than 520,000 square meters compared with the statistics reported in July this year, increasing the available area by 36.56 percent. The available area of ​​warehouses under the Tianjin Warehouse Management Office increased by 15 percent, and the available area of ​​freight yards increased by 44 percent. The available area of ​​warehouses of Beijing Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, Trust Company, Special Arts and Crafts Company, Petroleum Company, and Grain Company increased by an average of 24.35 percent. If calculated at 31 square meters per "truck unit" area, it can accommodate more than 13,000 trucks of goods. Calculated at a monthly warehouse rent of 10,000 yuan per square meter, Beijing and Tianjin alone can save the state more than 50 billion yuan per year. It is estimated that after the full and thorough implementation of quota management by the state-owned trading system in Wuhan, it can save more than 100 billion yuan annually.

The pilot units have adopted a liaison system for warehouse keepers, accountants, and sales personnel, shortening the delivery time. The delivery procedures of Beijing Department Store have been simplified from seven to two, and most of the goods that previously took two days to pick up can now be picked up in one hour. Due to simplified procedures, personnel have also been reduced by 28 percent. The First Warehouse of the Central South Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company implemented a method of simultaneous inspection, weighing, warehousing, and issuing formal receipts, basically achieving consistency between goods and accounts. This has gradually overcome the phenomena of unclear accounts and goods, chaotic procedures, and slow delivery.

Due to the close reliance of leading cadres on the working class and the development of mass wisdom, warehouse work has had many new creations. Employees of the Tianjin Warehouse Management Office created the "Commodity In/Out Command Sign" and "Dong Jianyi's Simple Measurement Method"; Liu Yanzhen, a warehouse cadre of Beijing Department Store, created a "Commodity Storage Method Plan," which played a significant role in clarifying the situation, promoting commodity circulation, and reducing commodity backlog.

The experience of these large cities in implementing the warehouse economic accounting system: First, leadership attention is an important part of warehouse reform. The significant achievements of Beijing, Tianjin and the First Warehouse of the Central South Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company are mainly due to the leading cadres paying close attention to this work and constantly mobilizing, supervising and inspecting. Second, closely rely on all employees, especially the porters, discuss with them methods that are both safe, convenient, and can store more goods, and jointly formulate quotas. A warehouse director of the Central South Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses and worked on quotas on the stacks of goods every day, and as a result, did not complete the task; the director of the First Warehouse relied on the workers and gave full play to the wisdom of the workers, and did this work very well. Facts have proved that any method that only emphasizes safety, only emphasizes storage quotas, and relies solely on administrative cadres without relying on workers will not work. Third, it is necessary to overcome conservative thinking and departmentalism, rely on the masses to fight against conservative thinking and departmentalism in a timely manner, so as to better carry out the work. The formulation of quotas by Tianjin Department Store and the improvement of stacking methods by the First Warehouse of the Central South Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company were successful only after fighting against conservative thinking and departmentalism and winning.

The main shortcomings in the current work are: the development of work is uneven, and some company leaders do not pay enough attention to this work. Some only pay attention to the establishment of warehouses and the experimentation of typical warehouses, and fail to carry out this work in a timely and comprehensive manner.

In order to further carry out this work, the Central Ministry of Commerce decided: First, thoroughly clarify the actual capacity of existing warehouses, improve stacking methods, implement quota management, and give full play to the utilization rate of existing equipment; Second, improve procedural systems, implement a liaison responsibility system, clarify the situation, improve storage methods, achieve rapid in and out of goods, ensure that inventory is not chaotic or wrong, and reduce losses and damages.

In order to do the above work well, the Central Ministry of Commerce decided to sort out the experience of trial work in various places in the past few months before the end of this year, and hold a warehouse work conference in January next year to exchange experiences, pass systems, quotas and work indicators, and plans for promoting advanced experience. Strive to completely measure the warehouses of nearly 100 cities across the country before the end of March next year. Major cities should establish warehouse companies as soon as possible under possible conditions to regulate the uneven distribution of warehouse use.

    北京、天津、上海、武汉四市国营贸易系统
    试行仓库经济核算制获得显著成绩
    提高了仓库使用率，开始克服账货不清、提货缓慢、手续
    混乱等现象
    北京、天津、上海、武汉等四大城市的国营贸易系统，从九月份开始试行仓库经济核算制，迄今已获得初步成绩。
    各试行单位都查清了仓库容量，提高了仓库使用率。经过实地丈量，天津市各国营贸易公司的货场总面积，比今年七月份统计上报数字增多五十二万多平方公尺，提高可用面积百分之三十六点五六。天津市仓库管理处所属仓库的可用面积，增加了百分之十五，货场可用面积增加了百分之四十四。北京市花纱布公司、信托公司、特种工艺公司、石油公司、粮食公司的仓库的可用面积，平均提高了百分之二十四点三五。如以每“车单位”面积相当于三十一平方公尺计算，约可容一万三千多车货物，以每月每平方公尺仓租一万元计算，北京、天津两市，一年可为国家节省财富五百多亿元。估计武汉市国营贸易系统全面彻底实行定额管理后，每年可节省一千亿元以上。
    各试行单位采用了保管员、会计员、营业人员的联系制度，缩短了提货时间。北京市百货公司提货手续由七道简化为二道，大部分货物以前要两天才能提取，现在一小时就可提取。由于简化了手续，人员也减少了百分之二十八。中南花纱布公司第一仓库实行同时检验、过磅、进仓、开正式收据的办法，基本上做到货账相符。这就逐渐克服了账货不清、手续混乱、提货缓慢等现象。
    由于领导干部紧密地依靠工人阶级，发挥了群众的智慧，使仓库工作有了很多新创造。天津市仓库管理处职工创造了“商品进出指挥牌”、“董坚毅简便丈量法”；北京市百货公司仓库干部刘彦贞创造“商品保管法平面图”，这对弄清家底、促进商品流转、减少商品积压起了很大的作用。
    这些大城市试行仓库经济核算制的经验：一、领导重视是仓库改革工作的重要一环。北京、天津两市及中南花纱布公司第一仓库取得了显著的成绩，主要是由于领导干部十分注意这个工作，不断地动员、督促和检查。二、紧密地依靠全体职工，特别是搬运工人，和他们讨论既安全、便利，又能存放较多货物的方法，并共同制定定额。中南花纱布公司有一个仓库主任不重视发动群众，天天爬在货垛上搞定额，结果没有完成任务；第一仓库主任依靠工人，充分发扬工人的智慧，把这个工作作得很好。事实证明，任何只强调安全，只强调保管定额，单靠行政干部而不依靠工人的办法，都是行不通的。三、必须克服保守思想和本位主义，依靠群众及时和保守思想与本位主义作斗争，才能更好地开展工作。天津市百货公司制定定额及中南花纱布公司第一仓库改进码垛法，都是和保守思想和本位主义作斗争并取得胜利后才成功的。
    目前工作中的主要缺点是：工作发展不平衡，部分公司领导干部对这一工作重视不够。有的只注意成立仓库和进行典型仓库的试验，未能及时全面地开展这一工作。
    中央商业部为了进一步开展这一工作，决定：一、彻底弄清现有仓库的实际容量，改进堆垛方法，实行定额管理，充分发挥现有设备利用率；二、改进手续制度，实行联系责任制，弄清家底，改进保管方法，做到出进货物迅速，保证库存不乱、不错，减少损耗、损失。
    为了做好上述工作，中央商业部决定在今年年底以前整理几个月来各地试行工作的经验，在明年一月召开仓库工作会议，交流经验，通过制度、定额和工作指标，和推广先进经验等计划。争取在明年三月底以前把全国近百个城市的仓库完全丈量完毕。各大城市在可能条件下，尽快成立仓库公司，以调剂仓库使用上的忙闲不均现象。
