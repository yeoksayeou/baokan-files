    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd: The U.S. side continuously violates the agreement and provoked by shelling the conference area again at 00:10 on the 20th. After the incident occurred, the security officers from both sides immediately went to the scene for a joint investigation. More than 30 craters were found within the boundary markers of the conference area, and many pieces of shrapnel were dug out. At the same time, two of our military police officers who witnessed the incident also testified that many shells were fired from the U.S. side's position at that time, and then shells exploded over the conference area. At that time, our side's position had not fired any shells. Therefore, this incident of violating the agreement was indeed committed by the U.S. side. Our chief liaison officer has protested to the other side's chief liaison officer regarding this matter.
    In the week before this incident, the U.S. side unscrupulously created as many as five incidents in violation of the agreement. These incidents included U.S. aircraft bombing delegation vehicles with obvious markers of the agreement, injuring five of our personnel; U.S. aircraft repeatedly invading the airspace over the conference area; and dropping insulting leaflets in the conference area. Regarding these endless provocative incidents, the U.S. side not only failed to provide a responsible explanation to our side one by one, but also completely disregarded the solemn agreement between the two sides and its own previous promises, and continued to create incidents to provoke. The U.S. side's premeditated and malicious intention to completely destroy the various agreements that serve as the basis for negotiations is very clear to the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd: At about 00:10 on December 20th, the U.S. side violated the agreement on the Kaesong armistice talks conference area and shelled the Panmunjom conference area, with shells exploding within the conference area. Regarding this incident in violation of the agreement, the security officers of the conference area from both sides conducted a joint investigation, and our side also conducted an internal investigation, determining the U.S. side's responsibility. On December 22nd, our chief liaison officer protested to the other side, demanding that the other side earnestly abide by the agreement, strictly restrain its military personnel, and prevent similar incidents from happening again. At the liaison officers' meeting on the same day, the other side admitted that U.S. military aircraft violated the agreement by intruding into the airspace over the conference area on December 17th, expressed regret, and claimed that measures had been taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

    我方联络官抗议美方再次炮击会场区
    美方承认十二月十七日美机违反协议侵入会场区事件
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美方连续破坏协议，在二十日零时十分又炮击会场区进行挑衅。事件发生后，双方安全军官当即赴现场共同调查。在会场区边界标志之内发现弹坑三十多处，并挖出弹片许多块。同时，曾目睹这一事件发生的我方军事警察两人也证明：当时从美方阵地方向射出许多炮弹，随后就有炮弹在会场区上空爆炸。而其时我方阵地方向未曾发射炮弹。因此，这一破坏协议事件确系美方所为。我方首席联络官已就此事向对方首席联络官提出抗议。
    在这一事件发生以前的一周内，美方肆无忌惮地制造违反协议的事件已达五次之多。这些事件包括美机轰炸置有双方协议的明显标志的代表团车辆，打伤我方人员五名；美机多次侵越会场区上空；在会场区内投发侮辱性传单。对这些层出不穷的挑衅事件，美方不但未曾一一向我方作负责交代，而且根本置双方庄严协议和美方自己的历次诺言于不顾，继续制造事件进行挑衅。美方蓄谋彻底破坏作为谈判基础的各种协议的罪恶意图，全世界已看得十分清楚。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】十二月二十日零时十分左右美方违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，炮击板门店会场区，炮弹在会场区内爆炸。对于这一违反协议的事件，双方会场区安全军官进行了共同调查，我方并进行了内部调查，确定了美方的责任。十二月二十二日我方首席联络官向对方提出抗议，要求对方切实遵守协议，严格约束其军事人员，使类似事件不再发生。同日双方联络官会议上，对方承认十二月十七日美方军用飞机违反协议侵入会场区上空，表示遗憾，并声称已采取措施，使今后不再发生类似事件。
