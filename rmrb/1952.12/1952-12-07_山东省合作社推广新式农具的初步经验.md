    Preliminary Experiences of Shandong Province Cooperatives in Promoting New Agricultural Implements
    Ma Lincai
    This year, cooperatives in Shandong Province have undertaken the task of promoting new agricultural implements. The province plans to promote 70,000 Liberation-style waterwheels, 25,000 new-style walking plows, 2,000 three-pronged light weeding hoes, and 5,000 seedling transplanters this year. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of September, 53,106 waterwheels had been promoted, accounting for 76% of the annual plan and 177% of the 30,000 units planned for last year; 19,519 walking plows were promoted, accounting for 78% of the annual plan and 600% of the 3,253 units supplied last year; 2,282 three-pronged light weeding hoes were promoted, accounting for 114% of the original plan; and 5,921 seedling transplanters were promoted (including a batch imitated by cooperatives at various levels), exceeding the original plan.
    The promotion of new agricultural implements has powerfully supported the drought prevention and resistance movement, playing a significant role in improving production efficiency and increasing yield per unit area. The relationship between cooperatives and the masses has thus become closer. The promotion of new agricultural implements has educated the peasants, consolidated many mutual aid teams, and organized some individual farmers.
    In the process of promoting new agricultural implements, some problems have occurred due to lack of experience and few technical cadres, but some experiences have also been explored. These are described below:
    First, the promotion of new agricultural implements is a powerful measure for the People's Government to assist farmers technically and financially and guide them to organize, and it is also a practical action for cooperatives to serve production. Therefore, when promoting new agricultural implements, it is necessary to correct purely business viewpoints and purely profit-making viewpoints. Under the leadership of the Communist Party committees and People's Governments at all levels in Shandong, cooperatives have conducted patriotic production increase education for farmers, taking the promotion of new agricultural implements as an important part of the patriotic production increase movement, so that the promotion of new agricultural implements has achieved certain results. However, in the spring, we overestimated the purchasing power of the farmers, wanting to complete the manufacture and sales of waterwheels worth more than 70 billion yuan with loans of more than 30 billion yuan, and proposed three supply methods: pre-sale, cash sale, and credit sale, requiring a loan period of one year (two harvest seasons), and striving to recover 30% of the cash at that time. For the new-style walking plow, emphasis was also placed on cash sales. This hindered the promotion of new agricultural implements and restricted farmers from borrowing extensively. Some grassroots cooperatives even engaged in coercive orders. When calculating costs, cooperatives had a fear of losses and a tendency to be too high, adding accumulated interest and business management fees, which increased the cost of each waterwheel by more than 80,000 yuan.
    We promptly corrected these errors, reduced the selling price of waterwheels, and extended the loan period (repayment in three harvest seasons, or four harvest seasons for individual difficulties); those loaned out in August were exempted from interest from August to December, and a policy of focusing on loans and striving for cash sales was adopted for walking plows. This is what allowed the smooth promotion of new agricultural implements.
    Second, in order to do a good job in promoting new agricultural implements, it is necessary to guide farmers to organize and should prioritize meeting the needs of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. According to statistics from typical materials of eight counties, 70% of waterwheels, over 93% of walking plows, over 63% of three-pronged light weeding hoes, and 95% of cotton seedling transplanters were supplied to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. This, on the one hand, met the demands of organized farmers to improve production and ensured better realization of the patriotic production increase plan; on the other hand, it consolidated cooperative and mutual aid organizations in terms of management and property relations, strengthened the unity of organization members, enabled new agricultural implements to play a huge role in production, and drove individual farmers to adopt new agricultural implements. Conversely, those who do not promote new agricultural implements to mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives first, but to individual farmers, are prone to coercive orders and are not easy to achieve the desired results. This is because organized farmers are more conscious than individual farmers. They are eager to improve productivity and have a high degree of enthusiasm and awareness to learn and use technology.
    Third, the central link in promoting new agricultural implements is the combination of leadership attention and technical guidance. Without leadership attention and technical guidance, it is impossible to do a good job in promoting new agricultural implements. Since the beginning of spring, we have consciously emphasized this aspect of work, proposing the slogan "Go out of the cooperative door, go deep into the countryside for technical guidance." Branch societies in some areas (such as the Changwei and Zibo special districts) and many county societies have convened technical personnel meetings or training classes. Some grassroots society cadres personally installed agricultural implements for farmers and taught them how to use them. Many places have adopted methods such as holding exhibitions, conducting education at market fairs, various farmer meetings, or mutual aid team leader meetings, and conducting on-site experiments. Some places have used propaganda networks, adopted typical demonstrations, organized visits, and other methods to conduct in-depth propaganda and education, breaking the conservative thinking of farmers and cadres, so that farmers and cadres can see with their own eyes that new agricultural implements are indeed better than old agricultural implements and are willing to adopt them.
    Facts have proven that when leading organs and relevant cadres pay attention to technical guidance, the promotion of new agricultural implements can be carried out rapidly. The Communist Party committees in Laiyang and Jiaozhou areas attach importance to walking plow technical guidance, and general cadres also pay attention to learning the technology of using walking plows and actively teach farmers to use them. The sales volume of walking plows in these areas is also higher than in other areas. Promoting new agricultural implements is an important task to reform agricultural productive forces. Farmers are restricted by conservative thinking, habits, and cultural levels, and it is not easy to accept them for a while. In addition, after purchasing new agricultural implements, some old agricultural implements must be discarded, and farmers have many considerations. Therefore, the process of promoting new agricultural implements is a difficult process of educating farmers from beginning to end. We must patiently conduct technical guidance and ideological education work for farmers. Any simplified approach is bound to fail.
    Fourth, the repair of new agricultural implements and the assembly of parts are urgent problems that need to be solved at present. Solving this problem will have a direct promoting effect on the promotion of new agricultural implements. This year, the supply of parts and repair work for new agricultural implements lags behind the demands of farmers. The supply of waterwheel parts is not timely, and sufficient preparation has not been made for the repair of walking plows. Many farmers are worried that new agricultural implements cannot be repaired if they are broken, or that there is nowhere to buy parts. We plan to solve this problem from two aspects: on the one hand, we will pre-fabricate enough parts next year according to the damage rate of parts; on the other hand, we will set up certain organizations to assemble and repair agricultural implements for farmers. For example, an agricultural implement repair station is set up under the production materials supply management department of the county cooperative to specialize in repairing and assembling agricultural implements for farmers. In this way, it is necessary to equip and train a group of technical personnel in cooperatives at all levels and organize local handicrafts, red stove cooperatives, or iron factories to manufacture parts and repair agricultural implements for farmers. However, there must be some full-time cadres responsible for leading this work.
    Fifth, close cooperation with relevant departments is very important in the promotion of agricultural implements. This year, Shandong Province cooperatives have combined with agricultural departments to jointly train cadres and conduct propaganda and experiments among the masses, which has played a great role. In order to do this work well, we will further strengthen ties with agricultural departments and train more than 300 cooperative cadres in service this winter to enable them to learn technology and prepare for the promotion of new agricultural implements next year.

    山东省合作社推广新式农具的初步经验
    马林才
    今年，山东省的合作社担负了推广新式农具的任务。全省计划在今年推广解放式水车七万部，新式步犁二万五千部，三齿轻便耘锄二千部，移苗器五千具。据不完全的统计，至九月底，已推广水车五三、一○六部，为全年计划的百分之七六，为去年计划数三万部的百分之一七七；推广步犁一九、五一九部，占全年计划数的百分之七八，为去年全年供应数三、二五三部的百分之六百；推广三齿轻便耘锄二、二八二部，为原计划数的百分之一一四；推广移苗器五九二一具（包括各级社仿造的一批在内），超过了原定的计划。
    新式农具的推广，有力地配合了防旱抗旱运动，在提高生产效率和提高单位面积产量上起了很大作用。合作社与群众的关系因此更加密切了。由于推广了新式农具，教育了农民，使许多互助组巩固起来，使一些个体农民组织起来了。
    在推广新式农具的过程中，由于缺乏经验和技术干部少，曾经发生了一些问题，但也摸索出一些经验。兹分述如下：
    第一、推广新式农具，是人民政府在技术上和财政上援助农民、引导农民组织起来的有力措施，也是合作社为生产服务的一种实际行动。因此，推广新农具的时候，必须纠正单纯业务观点及单纯营利观点。山东各地的合作社在各级中共党委和人民政府的领导下，对农民进行爱国增产教育，把推广新式农具作为爱国增产运动的一个重要内容，使新式农具的推广工作取得一定成绩。但在春季，我们曾过高地估计了农民的购买力，想以三百多亿元贷款，完成值七百多亿元的水车的制造和推销任务，提出了预售、现售和赊销等三种供应方法，要求以一年（两个收获季节）为贷放期限，并争取当时收回现款百分之三十。对于新式步犁也强调以现售为主。这样就妨碍了新式农具的推广，限制了农民大量贷用。有的基层合作社还发生了强迫命令的情形。合作社在计算成本时，存在着怕赔偏高的思想，多加了积压利息和业务管理费用，使每部水车成本提高八万多元。
    我们及时纠正了这些错误，减低了水车售价，并延长了贷放期限（三个收获季节还清，个别困难的四个收获季节还清）；八月份贷出的，免缴八至十二月的利息，对步犁采取了以贷放为主、争取现售的方针。这样才使新式农具得以顺利推广。
    第二、为了作好新式农具推广工作，必须引导农民组织起来，并应尽先满足农业生产合作社和互助组的需要。根据八个县的典型材料统计，水车有百分之七十、步犁有百分之九十三强、三齿轻便耘锄有百分之六十三强、棉花移苗器有百分之九十五是供应给农业生产合作社和互助组的。这样作，一方面满足了组织起来的农民提高生产的要求，保证了更好地实现爱国增产计划；另一方面在经营上和财产关系上巩固了合作互助组织，加强了组织成员的团结，使新式农具在生产中发挥了巨大的作用，并且带动了个体农民采用新式农具。反之，凡不先向互助组、农业生产合作社而先向个体农民去推广新式农具的，就容易产生强迫命令的偏向，不易收到应有的效果。这是因为组织起来的农民比个体农民的觉悟高，他们迫切要求提高生产力，也有学习使用技术的高度热情和自觉性。
    第三、推广新式农具的中心环节是领导重视和技术指导相结合。领导方面不重视和没有技术指导，都不可能作好新式农具的推广工作。入春以来，我们曾经有意识地强调了这一方面的工作，提出“走出合作社大门，深入农村进行技术指导”的口号。有些地区（如昌潍、淄博等专区）的分社及许多县社都召开了技术人员会议或训练班。有些基层社干部亲自为农民安装农具并教会使用。不少地方采取了开展览会，在集市展览，在各种农民会议上或互助组长会议上进行教育，和现场试验的办法。有的地方运用宣传网，采取典型示范，组织参观等方法，深入宣传教育，打破农民及干部的保守思想，使农民和干部亲眼看到新式农具的确比旧式农具好而乐意采用。
    事实证明：领导机关及有关干部重视了技术指导，新式农具的推广工作就能迅速开展起来。莱阳和胶州地区的中共党委重视步犁技术指导，一般干部也就注意学习使用步犁的技术，并积极教导农民使用，这些地区的步犁销售数量也就比其他地区多。推广新式农具是改革农业生产力的一项重要工作，农民受保守思想、习惯和文化水平的限制，一时是不易接受的。加以购置新农具后，就要废弃一些旧农具，农民更有许多考虑。因此，推广新式农具的过程，自始至终是个艰苦地教育农民的过程，必须耐心地对农民进行技术指导及思想教育工作，任何简单化的作法，是一定要失败的。
    第四、新式农具的修理和零件装配，在目前是迫切需要解决的问题。这个问题解决了，对新式农具的推广会发生直接的推动作用。今年新式农具的零件供应及修理工作，是落后于农民的要求的。水车零件的供应不及时，对步犁的修理也未作充分准备。许多农民都顾虑新农具坏了无法修理，或没处买零件。我们拟从两方面着手解决这个问题：一方面，在明年根据零件损坏率预制足够的零件；另方面，设立一定的组织，专为农民装配和修理农具。例如在县合作社生产资料供应经理部下设农具修配站，专门为农民修理、装配农具。这样，就需要在各级合作社配备和培养一批技术人员，并组织当地的手工业、红炉合作社或铁工厂制造零件，为农民修理农具。但必须有部分专职干部负责领导这一工作。
    第五、在农具推广工作中，和有关部门密切配合，是十分重要的。今年山东省合作社曾与农业部门结合，共同训练干部，并在群众中进行宣传和试验，起的作用很大。为了把这一工作作好，我们将进一步加强与农业部门的联系，在今冬训练三百余名合作社在职干部，使他们学会技术，为明年推广新式农具的工作作好准备。
