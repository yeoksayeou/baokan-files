Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 26th: The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant completed its national production plan for this year on December 26th, five days and twenty hours ahead of schedule. This is a great achievement on our country's production front. This year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant's pig iron production increased by 18.7% compared to last year. In terms of quality, the output of first-grade steelmaking pig iron only accounted for 75.2% of the total pig iron output last year, but this year it has increased to 90.5%, exceeding the state-stipulated quality plan by 0.5%. Over the past year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant has vigorously promoted a series of advanced Soviet experiences such as the "full blast, fast charging, smooth operation method," the "furnace top adjustment method," the "steam blowing operation method," and the "taphole protection method," which have greatly improved the production and quality of pig iron.
    Now, all the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant have decided to produce pig iron equivalent to 2.1% of this year's target for the country before the end of the year. They have written a letter to Chairman Mao, stating: We will never be arrogant or complacent, but will continue to vigorously learn from advanced Soviet experience, master and become proficient in advanced technologies of automation and mechanization, meet the economic production tasks for 1953, and strive to produce more high-quality pig iron!

    鞍山炼铁厂提前完成生产计划
    【新华社鞍山二十六日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂已在十二月二十六日提前五天零二十小时完成今年国家生产计划。这是我国生产战线上的一件大喜事。今年鞍钢炼铁厂的生铁产量比去年提高了百分之十八点七。在质量方面，去年一级制钢生铁的产量只占生铁总产量百分之七十五点二，今年已增加到百分之九十点五，超过了国家规定的质量计划百分之零点五。一年来，鞍钢炼铁厂大力推行了“全风快料顺行法”、“炉顶调剂法”、“蒸气鼓风操作法”、“出铁口保护法”等一系列的苏联先进经验，使生铁的产量和质量都大为提高。
    现在鞍钢炼铁厂全体职工决定到年底以前再为国家生产等于今年任务百分之二点一的生铁。他们已写信向毛主席表示：决不骄傲自满，要继续大力学习苏联先进经验，掌握和精通自动化和机械化操作的先进技术，迎接一九五三年经济生产任务，为生产更多的、质量优良的生铁而奋斗！
