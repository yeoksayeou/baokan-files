    National Credit Cooperative Organizations are Growing Stronger:
    Organizing Farmers' Idle Funds, Promoting Production, and Combating Usury
    With the restoration and development of agricultural production and the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, credit cooperative undertakings throughout the country have also gradually developed. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 8,124 credit cooperative organizations nationwide. Compared with the period before the National Rural Financial Conference in May 1951: credit cooperatives have increased from 97 to 1,764, an increase of 17 times; credit mutual aid groups have increased from 69 to 5,239, an increase of 75 times; the credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives have increased from 610 to 1,121, an increase of approximately one time. The objective reasons for the development of credit cooperative organizations in various regions are: the labor mutual aid and production cooperation movement in the old liberated areas has generally developed, production technology is being improved, and the need for production funds is more frequent and concentrated; the emancipated peasants in the newly liberated areas generally lack production funds and also have many difficulties in life; the loans from state banks cannot yet meet the broad demands of farmers, and usury takes the opportunity to rise; farmers demand credit cooperation to meet the needs of developing production and solving temporary difficulties. In addition, with the local party and government organs attaching importance to this work and the strong support of banks, credit cooperative organizations have gradually developed.
    Credit cooperative organizations in various regions have achieved great results in absorbing idle social funds, activating rural finance, and supporting mass production. As of October this year, Shanxi Province's credit cooperative organizations have developed to 2,620 (with more than 532,500 members, 11.3936 billion yuan in share capital, and more than 3.579 million catties of grain). The production loans it issued helped farmers purchase 14,399 head of livestock, 490 carts, 229 waterwheels, dig 704 wells, repair 102 water gates, dredge 61 irrigation canals, and buy 1,228 walking plows. It also solved many problems for the masses such as pesticides, seeds, and food. This has greatly promoted the province's patriotic production increase competition movement this year. In some areas, the close integration of credit cooperatives with production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and supply and marketing cooperatives has further promoted the development and consolidation of production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and supply and marketing cooperatives, and promoted the development of rural collectivization.
    In areas with credit cooperative organizations, usury has been greatly reduced or eliminated, and free lending among farmers has gradually become normal. In Majiata Village, Sixth District, Lishi County, Shanxi, poor farmers borrowed from private individuals last year at interest rates generally around 10%; after the establishment of a credit cooperative this year, the social interest rate dropped to 3%. In Pingyuan Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, usury was rampant in the past. After the establishment of the credit department of the cooperative this spring, usury lost its market. The 54 households in the village who originally engaged in usury deposited all their funds into the credit department.
    In addition to conducting deposit and loan business, credit cooperative organizations in various regions also accept the entrustment of state banks and insurance companies to handle savings and livestock insurance business. This strengthens the organization and leadership of state banks over rural financial work and also strengthens the relationship between state banks and farmers. Therefore, the broad masses of farmers cherish credit cooperatives very much, and many farmers call credit cooperatives their "small banks."
    The main problems currently existing in credit cooperative work across the country are uneven development. The Northeast and Central-South regions and Shanxi Province have seen rapid development of credit cooperative undertakings due to the importance attached to them by leaders; the development of credit cooperatives in other regions lags far behind rural needs. In areas where credit cooperatives have already been organized, there have been phenomena of fewer deposits and more loans in spring and summer, and more deposits and fewer loans in autumn and winter, as well as uneven prosperity and decline of funds in different regions. This requires state banks to adjust the situation. Some credit cooperatives do not pay enough attention to deposit and loan business, especially organizing the funds of the masses, and rely solely on state bank loans to carry out loan business; some credit cooperatives have not been well integrated with agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and supply and marketing cooperatives, which affects the further development of credit cooperation and also affects better support for agricultural production. All regions should pay attention to solving these problems.

    全国信用合作组织日益发展壮大
    组织农民的闲散资金，推动生产，打击高利贷
    随着农业生产的恢复发展和农村互助合作运动的发展，全国各地的信用合作事业也逐渐发展起来。根据不完全统计，目前全国信用合作组织已有八千一百二十四个，和一九五一年五月全国农村金融会议前比较：信用合作社由九十七个发展到一千七百六十四个，增加了十七倍；信用互助组由六十九个发展到五千二百三十九个，增加了七十五倍；供销社的信用部由六百一十个发展到一千一百二十一个，增加约一倍。各地信用合作组织发展的客观原因是：老解放区劳动互助、生产合作运动已有普遍的发展，生产技术正在改良，生产资金的需要更为频繁和集中；新解放区翻身农民普遍缺乏生产资金，生活上也有很多困难；国家银行的贷款还不能满足农民的广泛要求，高利贷乘机抬头；农民要求信用合作，以满足发展生产，解决临时性困难的需要。加以当地党政机关重视这一工作，银行又大力扶植，信用合作组织就逐渐发展起来了。
    各地信用合作组织在吸收社会闲散资金，活跃农村金融和扶植群众生产上，取得了很大成绩。截至今年十月，山西省信用合作组织已发展到二千六百二十个（社员五十三万二千五百多人，股金款一百一十三亿九千三百六十万元，粮三百五十七万九千多斤），它发放出去的用于生产的贷款，扶助农民群众购买了牲畜一万四千三百九十九头、大车四百九十辆、水车二百二十九架、打水井七百零四眼、修水闸一百零二个、整理水渠六十一条、买步犁一千二百二十八部，并为群众解决了许多农药、种子、食粮等问题。这对该省今年的农业爱国增产竞赛运动起了很大推动作用。有些地区的信用社和生产合作社、互助组、供销社密切结合，更促进了生产合作社、互助组和供销社的发展与巩固，推动了农村合作化的发展。
    在有信用合作组织的地区，高利贷已经大大减少或绝迹，农民之间的自由借贷逐渐走向正常。山西离石县六区马家塔村贫苦农民在去年向私人借贷，利率一般都在十分左右；今年建立信用合作社后，社会利率即降至三分。吉林省舒兰县平原村过去高利贷很猖狂，今春合作社信用部成立后，高利贷失去市场，该村原来放高利贷的五十四户，都将全部资金存入信用部。
    各地信用合作组织除进行存放业务外，还接受国家银行、保险公司的委托，办理储蓄和牲畜保险业务。这使国家银行对农村金融工作的组织和领导更为加强，也密切了国家银行和农民的关系。因此，广大农民对信用合作社十分爱护，很多农民把信用合作社称作是自己的“小银行”。
    目前全国各地信用合作工作中存在的主要问题是发展不平衡。东北、中南区及山西省因领导重视，信用合作事业发展较快；其他地区信用合作发展远远落后于农村需要。在信用合作已经组织起来的地区，发生了春、夏存少贷多，秋、冬存多贷少，以及不同地区资金荣枯不均的现象。这需要国家银行从中进行调剂。有些信用合作社对存、贷业务特别是组织群众的资金还不够重视，单纯依靠国家银行贷款进行放款业务；还有些信用合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组、供销社没有很好结合起来，这都影响了信用合作的进一步发展，也就影响到对农业生产的更好的扶助。各地应注意解决这些问题。
