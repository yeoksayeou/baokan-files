Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: Bangkok dispatch: Since November 10th, the Thai Phibun government has continuously and massively arrested Thai peace movement activists, illegally detaining Lin Xue, the editor-in-chief of the Bangkok Chinese newspaper "Quan Min Bao," two employees of the newspaper, and two employees of the "Dazhong Culture Company" which printed the newspaper. Subsequently, on the 24th, it closed down "Quan Min Bao" and another Chinese newspaper, "Nan Chen Bao."

According to the Thai-language "Chen Bao," which is close to the Thai police authorities, Police Chief Nai Phao Sriyanond colluded with American and British imperialist elements before carrying out this crackdown on domestic peace movements and persecution of Chinese newspapers. Nai Phao openly stated that the Thai authorities took these measures because they accepted the "advice" of the United States and Britain, and accepted the "advice" because Thailand "had obtained economic and military assistance from the United States and Britain."

As everyone knows, in recent years, the Phibun government, due to its policies of turning Thailand into an American war base, providing cannon fodder for the American aggression against Korea, and engaging in military expansion and war preparations, has greatly deepened the suffering of the Thai people. The broad masses of the Thai people, in order to defend their vital interests, have risen up to participate in the movement for peace. The Phibun government is attempting to use fascist means to oppose the people's demands for peace. The criminal nature of this measure has been exposed by some Thai newspapers. The enraged Thai reactionaries then proposed a fascist method of destroying freedom of speech in parliament on November 24th, and at the same time announced the closure of "Quan Min Bao" and "Nan Chen Bao," attempting to strengthen the suppression of the people on the one hand, and implement a consistent anti-Chinese policy to divert the attention of the Thai people on the other.

The Thai people clearly recognize this conspiracy and hate the Phibun reactionary group's criminal policies even more. Our compatriots residing in Thailand are even more indignant at the Phibun government's unreasonable measures to close "Quan Min Bao" and "Nan Chen Bao."

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, issued a statement protesting the Thai government's closure of "Quan Min Bao" and "Nan Chen Bao." The full text of the statement is as follows:

On November 24th of this year, the Thai Phibun government unreasonably closed down "Quan Min Bao" and "Nan Chen Bao," which have a long history in Thailand and truly represent the public opinion of the overseas Chinese. Prior to this, the Thai Phibun government illegally detained Lin Xue, the editor-in-chief of "Quan Min Bao," two employees of the newspaper, and two employees of the "Dazhong Culture Company" which printed the newspaper.

It must be pointed out that the Phibun government has consistently persecuted our overseas Chinese residing in Thailand. Now it is not only continuing the persecution, but also expanding and deepening it. The Thai government's increase in the foreign resident identity card fee in February this year is an example of a brutal measure to intensify the persecution of millions of our overseas Chinese residing in Thailand. This time it has gone even further, unreasonably closing down "Quan Min Bao" and "Nan Chen Bao" and depriving our overseas Chinese of their legitimate rights. This is intolerable to the people of our country and the overseas Chinese residing in Thailand!

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government hereby issues a warning regarding this matter, demanding that the Phibun government immediately cease its crimes of persecuting our overseas Chinese residing in Thailand, release all illegally arrested overseas Chinese, and immediately unseal "Quan Min Bao" and "Nan Chen Bao" so that they can continue to be published, otherwise the Phibun government shall bear all serious consequences.

### 华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝发表声明  抗议泰政府无理封闭“全民报”和“南辰报”

    华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝发表声明
    抗议泰政府无理封闭“全民报”和“南辰报”
    【新华社七日讯】曼谷消息：泰国銮披汶政府自十一月十日起连续大举逮捕泰国和平运动人士，非法拘留了曼谷华侨报纸“全民报”的总编辑林学、该报职员二人和承印该报的“大众文化公司”的职员二人，接着于二十四日封闭了“全民报”和另一家华侨报纸“南辰报”。
    据接近泰国警察当局的泰文“晨报”透露：警察总监乃炮·是耶暖在进行这次镇压国内和平运动和迫害华侨报纸的措施之前，曾与美、英帝国主义分子共同密谋过。乃炮曾公开地说：泰国当局采取这些措施是因为接受美国和英国的“劝告”，而接受“劝告”是因为泰国“曾获得了美国与英国在经济上和军事上的援助”。
    大家知道：銮披汶政府近几年来由于执行把泰国变为美国战争基地、为美国提供侵朝炮灰和进行扩军备战等政策，已大大加深了泰国人民的痛苦。广大的泰国人民为了保卫自己的切身利益，纷纷起来参加争取和平的运动。銮披汶政府力图以法西斯手段来反对人民的和平要求，这一措施的罪恶本质曾为泰国某些报纸所揭发。老羞成怒的泰国反动集团乃于十一月二十四日在议会中提出了摧残言论自由的法西斯办法，同时宣布封闭“全民报”和“南辰报”，妄图一面加强压制人民，一面实行一贯的排华政策来转移泰国民众的视线。
    泰国人民清楚地认识这一阴谋，越加痛恨銮披汶反动集团的罪恶政策。旅居泰国的我国侨胞，对銮披汶政府封闭“全民报”与“南辰报”的无理措施，更非常愤慨。
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员发表声明，抗议泰国政府封闭“全民报”和“南辰报”。声明全文如下：
    泰国銮披汶政府于本年十一月二十四日无理封闭了在泰国历史悠久、真正代表华侨民意的“全民报”和“南辰报”。在这之前，泰国銮披汶政府非法拘留了“全民报”的总编辑林学、该报职员二人，和承印该报的“大众文化公司”的职员二人。
    必须指出，銮披汶政府一贯地对我居留泰国的侨民进行迫害，现在不仅继续迫害，而且还在扩大和加深。今年二月间，泰国政府提高外侨随身证例费，即是加紧迫害我居留泰国的数百万侨民之横蛮措施的一个例子。这次更变本加厉，无理封闭“全民报”和“南辰报”，剥夺我国侨民的正当权利。这是我全国人民和居留泰国的侨民所不能容忍的！
    中央人民政府华侨事务委员会特对此事提出警告，要求銮披汶政府立即停止迫害我国居留泰国的侨民的罪行，释放一切被非法拘捕的华侨，并立即启封“全民报”及“南辰报”，使之继续出版，否则一切严重后果应由銮披汶政府负全部责任。
