    Xinhua News Agency, 1st. A reporter from this agency visited relevant departments of the Central People's Government to ask questions on various issues concerning Japanese nationals in China, and received the following answers:

    Q: How many Japanese nationals are currently in our country?

    A: There are approximately 30,000 Japanese nationals in our country.

    Q: What is their situation in China?

    A: The eight-year war of aggression launched by the Japanese militarist government in the past caused unforgettable and monstrous crimes to the Chinese people. However, our people clearly recognize that Japanese militarists were, are, and will be our enemies, while the Japanese people are our friends. Our people treat law-abiding Japanese nationals in China with a friendly attitude. They, like all law-abiding foreign nationals, are protected by our People's Government. Japanese employees working in our public and private enterprises also enjoy the protection of our labor laws and labor insurance benefits. Their lives are becoming increasingly prosperous. The recent large remittances of funds by Japanese nationals as maintenance fees for their families in Japan are proof of this.

    Q: Besides Japanese nationals, what other Japanese people remain in our country?

    A: In addition to nationals, there are a small number of Japanese war criminals. Some of these war criminals committed bloody crimes against the Chinese people during the war of aggression, and some joined the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit troops to oppose our people after the Japanese surrender. These war criminals are currently being detained, awaiting trial. As for Japanese prisoners of war, except for those detained by the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gangs, they were all repatriated before the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Q: What policy does the government adopt towards Japanese nationals who wish to return to their country?

    A: Our government has always been willing to assist Japanese nationals who voluntarily wish to return to Japan. In fact, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, many Japanese nationals have returned home. However, this was later hampered due to a lack of ships in this regard, so the majority of Japanese nationals who wish to return home have not yet been able to achieve their wishes.

    Q: What measures will the government take to assist Japanese nationals who wish to return home in the future?

    A: As long as the Japanese side can find a way to solve the ship problem, our government and people are eager to work hard to help Japanese nationals return home. Japanese nationals who wish to return home can apply for departure by following the general departure procedures for foreign nationals, and can leave the country after the relevant Chinese government authorities issue a certificate.

    Q: How should the procedures for incoming ships and various specific issues concerning the repatriation of Japanese nationals be handled?

    A: The relevant Japanese authorities or people's organizations can send people to specifically consult and resolve the matter with the Chinese Red Cross Society.

    关于在中国的日本侨民的各项问题
    中央人民政府有关方面答新华社记者问
    【新华社一日讯】本社记者走访中央人民政府有关方面提出关于在中国的日本侨民的各项问题，承答复如下：
    问：现在在我国有多少日侨？
    答：在我国日侨共有三万左右。
    问：他们在中国的情况怎样？
    答：日本军国主义政府过去发动的八年侵华战争，对于我国人民造成令人难忘的滔天罪行，但我国人民明确地认清日本军国主义者曾经是而且将来也是我国的仇敌，而日本人民则是我们的朋友，我国人民是以友好态度对待在华的守法日侨的。他们和所有守法外侨一样，受到我人民政府的保护。在我公私营企业中工作的日侨职工，还享受我国劳动法令的保护和劳动保险的待遇。他们的生活日益充裕，最近数月来，日侨汇出大批款项，作为其在日本的家眷的赡养费，就是一个证明。
    问：除了日本侨民之外，还有什么样的日本人留在我国？
    答：除了侨民之外，还有少数日本战犯。这些战犯有的在侵略战争中，曾对我国人民犯下血腥罪行，有的是在日寇投降后，参加蒋阎匪军与我人民为敌。这些战犯现正拘押中，听候审讯。至于日本俘虏，除为蒋阎匪帮扣留者外，早在中华人民共和国成立之前，遣送完毕。
    问：对于愿意回国的日本侨民，政府采取什么方针？
    答：我国政府向来愿意协助自愿回国的日本侨民返回日本。事实上，自中华人民共和国成立以来，已有不少日侨回国。但后因在这方面缺乏船只致又遭到阻难，因此多数愿意回国的日侨，现在还不能达到他们的愿望。
    问：今后日本侨民如愿意回国，政府将采取什么措施予以协助？
    答：只要日本方面有办法解决船只问题，我国政府和人民亟愿努力协助日侨回国。凡愿意回国的日侨按一般外侨出境手续办理出境申请经中国政府一定机关发给证明后即可出境。
    问：来船手续以及日侨回国的各项具体问题如何办理？
    答：可由日本方面的相当机关或人民团体派人来和我国红十字会具体协商解决。
