    Examining My Understanding of Basic Construction
    Bai Hao, Director of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant (State-Owned)
    On the eve of our nation’s large-scale economic construction, I believe the policy of placing basic construction in a primary position is entirely correct and necessary, judging from the development of our plant's basic construction and productive forces over the past three years.

    The development of our plant's production has greatly exceeded the highest output during the Japanese puppet regime. To date, regarding several major products: iron exceeds the highest output during the Japanese puppet regime by 270 percent, steel by 474 percent, steel materials by 600 percent, and coke by 440 percent. These achievements are mainly due to the leadership of the Party, the workers' efforts to tap the enterprise's potential, and the timely completion of restoration work.

    When we took over the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, most of the equipment had been destroyed by the enemy. Therefore, our plant's repair tasks in the past two years were substantial. To accomplish this arduous repair task, under the leadership and strong support of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, as well as the local Party committee and government, we gradually strengthened our own construction forces, especially the construction workforce. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, we contracted out 80 percent of the projects to private merchants. Due to the merchants' corner-cutting and substandard work, the engineering quality was poor, the progress was slow, and the losses were enormous. We learned from this lesson and, after the "Three-Anti" movement, drew cadres from various departments to strengthen the basic construction organization and transferred the repair department to the basic construction department. From July to November, a total of 202 people were transferred, 126 worker-cadres were promoted, and a large number of workers were recruited from outside the plant, expanding our construction workforce to over 6,000, including over 2,000 skilled workers. At the same time, under the guidance of the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, we adopted the principle of "concentrating forces and focusing on key projects," ensuring that major projects crucial to production were put into operation as early as possible. In addition, the increased awareness of the staff and workers and the active promotion of advanced experiences enabled us to repair and start production in a timely manner with the new coke oven, the new coal washing workshop, the thin plate factory, and the electric furnace.

    Despite the many efforts we have made in the past and the certain achievements we have attained, until I attended the National Factory and Mine Directors Conference of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in mid-November, I did not have a sufficient understanding of the political and economic significance of basic construction, and therefore did not seriously value basic construction work. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, we put forward the principle of "basic construction serving production." This shows that in our thinking, we subordinated basic construction to production. After the "Three-Anti" movement, due to the increasing burden of basic construction tasks and the strict supervision from the central authorities, we put forward the principle of "equal emphasis on production and basic construction." However, because we did not truly recognize the importance of basic construction, in our actual work, our leadership forces often still emphasized production and neglected basic construction. In June of this year, the higher authorities asked us to transfer cadres from the production departments to the basic construction departments. Although we transferred 26 people, most of them were punished during the "Three-Anti" movement. In August, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China gave our plant 103 cadres, but we only sent four to the basic construction department, and the rest were sent to the production departments. For example, in late October, when we arranged for the formulation of next year's plan, we discussed the production plan in great detail, but the basic construction plan was not mentioned. Some comrades even requested transferring cadres from the basic construction department to the production department. Our plant's basic construction tasks for next year are no lighter than this year, but some responsible comrades still do not value this work, believing that the policy of placing basic construction in a primary position is not suitable for the situation of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant.

    Due to insufficient recognition of the importance of basic construction, lack of foresight in basic construction, and failure to strengthen leadership in basic construction, many shortcomings have been caused in our work. This is specifically manifested in:

    1.  Chaotic work situation in basic construction. We have confused basic construction administration, design, and construction into one. For a long time, we did not establish strict design review systems and project acceptance systems. Many projects had problems, but no one was responsible, and everyone shirked responsibility. For example, after the coal washing and coking project started production, problems were discovered. The production department asked the construction department to correct the shortcomings in the project. The construction unit would sometimes say that the production department was nitpicking, and sometimes complained that the design department's design was inadequate. After a lot of fuss, it was still unknown who was responsible.

    2.  Lack of a complete basic construction concept. The phenomenon of designing, constructing, modifying, and reworking simultaneously often occurs. When building the physical and chemical laboratory building, due to the urgency of construction, there were no design drawings, so the drawings of the hospital building were used to build the analysis institute. As a result, the house was too short and the machines could not be installed. The designed bathhouse had no place to put clothes, and you had to get into the pool as soon as you entered. This year, when rushing to complete a certain project, due to inadequate design, the design department had to send someone to the repair shop to modify the drawings. The drawings were modified at any time, and the constructors also had to rework at any time.

    3.  Failure to recognize that the quality of the design will affect future production. Some cadres have the mentality of doing short-term work, thinking that there will be no basic construction after completing a few projects; some think that design and construction are technical problems and that "laymen" cannot lead, which is actually giving up leadership. As a result, design work has fallen into a state of laissez-faire.

    4.  Lack of an economic accounting perspective. Often, only the financial figures and cost situation of basic construction projects are considered, and how to conduct economic accounting from major aspects such as design and construction is not considered. As a result, funds are often tied up on the one hand, and work is suspended waiting for materials on the other hand; designs are modified at any time, and the plan for purchasing materials is changed accordingly, destroying the budget system. For example, the materials for a certain gas furnace building were prepared before the design was carried out, but the original materials could not be found during construction (they were used elsewhere), so it had to be redesigned, changing the construction plan. For a certain machine installation project, it was not until the last screw was being tightened that it was discovered that there were no screws, and an additional eight tons of screws were budgeted temporarily. When production started, it was discovered that there were no operating tools. These phenomena make us very passive in fund management and cause serious waste.

    From our experience in our work, we believe that the policy of "placing basic construction in a primary position" must be implemented in practical work. Experience tells us that to embody this policy, we must improve the organization and strengthen the basic construction force, otherwise this policy will fall through. To achieve this, we must have a correct understanding and sufficient determination to transfer a large number of excellent cadres, technicians, and workers from the production departments to the basic construction departments. The production departments must vigorously train cadres and train cadres to continuously improve them ideologically, professionally, and technically, so as to continuously transport new blood to basic construction in a timely manner and increase new strength. We plan to adopt "two systems" (deputy system, candidate list system) and "four methods" (professional training, signing apprenticeship contracts, rotating training for new and old workers, part-time work and part-time study) to ensure the realization of the plan to train cadres and technicians.

### 检查我对基本建设的认识

    检查我对基本建设的认识
    国营太原钢铁厂厂长  白浩
    在祖国大规模经济建设的前夕，将基本建设放在首要的地位的这一个方针，从我厂三年来基本建设与生产力量的发展上看，我觉得这一转变是十分正确的和必要的。
    我厂生产的发展已大大超过日伪时期的最高产量。到目前为止，就几种主要产品看：铁超过日伪时期最高产量百分之二百七十，钢超过百分之四百七十四，钢材超过百分之六百，焦炭超过百分之四百四十。这一成绩之得来，主要是在党的领导下，由于工人群众发挥企业的潜在力，以及修复工作的及时完成。
    我们接管太原钢铁厂时，大部分设备都被敌人破坏了，因此，我厂过去两年的修建任务是很大的。为了完成这一艰巨的修建任务，在中央重工业部和钢铁工业局以及地方党委和政府的领导与大力帮助下，我们逐渐地壮大了自己的建设力量，特别是施工力量。“三反”运动以前，我们把百分之八十的工程包给私商，由于奸商的偷工减料，工程质量低劣，进度迟缓，损失巨大，我们接受这一教训，“三反”运动后，即从各方面抽调干部充实基本建设机构，并将修造部到划归基本建设部门。从七月到十一月共调去二百零二人，提拔工人干部一百二十六人，并由厂外大量招收工人，使我们的施工力量发展到六千余人，其中技术工人二千余人。同时在中央钢铁工业局的指示下，采取“集中力量，重点施工”的方针，保证把在生产上有关键性的主要工程尽早争取投入生产。再加上职工的觉悟提高，积极推广先进经验，这就使我们能及时地把新焦炉、新洗煤工场、薄板工厂、电炉修好并开始生产。
    尽管我们过去做了许多工作，并取得了一定的成绩，但直到十一月中旬参加重工业部全国厂矿长会议以前，我们对基本建设的政治意义和经济意义还没有足够的认识，因而没有认真地重视基本建设工作。在“三反”运动以前，我们提出“基本建设为生产服务”的方针。这说明了我们在思想上是把基本建设从属于生产的。“三反”运动以后，由于基本建设任务的日益加重，以及中央的严厉督促，我们提出“生产与基本建设并重”的方针。但由于没有真正认清基本建设的重要，因此，在实际工作中，我们的领导力量，往往仍是重生产轻基本建设。今年六月上级要我们从生产部门抽调干部到基本建设部门去，我们虽然调去了二十六人，但其中大部分是在“三反”中受到处分的。八月份中共山西省委给我们厂一百零三个干部，我们只把四个人派到基本建设部门，其余的都派在生产部门去。又如十月下旬我们布置制订明年的计划工作时，对生产计划的制订讨论得很详细，而对基本建议计划则没有提。甚至个别同志还要求从基本建设部门调干部到生产部门去。我厂明年的基本建设任务并不比今年的轻，但个别负责同志却仍然没有重视这个工作，认为把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，不适合于太原钢铁厂的情况。
    由于对基本建设的重要性认识不足，对基本建设缺乏远见，没有加强对基本建设的领导，在工作中造成了不少缺点。这具体表现在：
    一、基本建设中的工作情况混乱。我们把基本建设行政管理、设计和施工混为一团。我们曾有很长时间没有建立严格的设计审查制度和工程验收制度，许多工程出了毛病无人负责，互相推诿。如洗煤和炼焦工程开始生产后发现毛病，生产部门要求施工部门改正工程中的缺点；施工单位一会见说生产部门吹毛求疵；一会儿埋怨设计部门设计不周，闹了半天还不知是谁的责任。
    二、缺乏完整的基本建设观点，不研究基本建设程序，边设计、边施工、边修改、边返工的现象经常发生。修建理化实验大楼时，因急于施工，无设计图纸，就用医院大楼的图纸来盖分析所。结果，房子过矮，机器装不进去。设计的澡塘没有放衣服的地方，进门就得下水池。今年突击某项工程时，由于设计不周，设计部门只好派专人在修造从事修改图样。图样随时修改，施工者也就随时跟着返工。
    三、没有认识设计的好坏，会影响将来的生产。个别干部存在着打短工思想，认为完成几项工程后就没有基本建设了；有的认为设计、施工，是技术问题，“外行”无法领导，实际上是放弃了领导。因而设计工作陷于自流状态。
    四、缺乏经济核算观点。往往只看基本建设工程的财务数字，成本情形，而没有从设计、施工等主要方面考虑如何进行经济核算。因而往往一面积压资金、一面停工待料；随时修改设计，随时跟着变更购买材料的计划，破坏了预算制度。如：某煤气炉场房是准备好了材料才进行设计的，但施工时找不着原来的材料了（用到别处去了），不得不从新设计，改变施工计划。某机器安装工程到最后上螺丝时才发现没有螺丝，临时又追加了八吨螺丝预算。到开始生产时又发现没有操作工具。这些现象，使我们在资金管理上十分被动，并造成严重浪费。
    从我们工作中的体会，我们认为必须将“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，贯彻到实际工作中去。经验告诉我们，要体现这一方针必须健全机构、充实基本建设力量，否则这一方针就会落空。而要作到这一点，必须有正确的认识和足够的决心，从生产部门抽调大批优秀干部、技术人员和工人到基本建设部门去。而生产部门必须大力培养干部、训练干部，使他们在思想上、业务上、技术上不断提高，以便及时地不断地向基本建设输送新的血液，增加新生力量。我们拟采取“两种制度”（副职制、候补名单制）和“四种办法”（专业训练、订师徒合同、新老工人轮训、半工半读）来保证培养干部和技术人员计划的实现。
