    National Secondary Schools Have Already Experienced Considerable Development This Autumn
    In order to cultivate reserve forces for the nation's advanced construction talent and to meet the people's demands for improving their cultural level, national secondary schools have undergone a considerable expansion and focused development this autumn. According to statistics from materials collected by our agency's reporters in major administrative regions, national secondary schools enrolled 989,827 new students this autumn. Combined with the original students, the total number of secondary school students nationwide has now reached 2,394,072, an increase of 60% compared to the highest number of secondary school students in 1946.
    Developing secondary schools is one of the key issues in educational construction in the coming years. Currently, the development of secondary education, especially middle school education, is far from meeting the needs of universities and primary schools, forming a "bottleneck" in the entire education system. Over the past three years, higher education and primary education in our country have both made great progress. The number of students enrolled in national universities has increased from more than 130,000 in 1949 to more than 219,000 this autumn, and the number of primary school students nationwide has increased from more than 24.39 million in 1949 to 49 million. Although the number of secondary schools across the country has doubled in the past three years, it still cannot keep up with the demand due to the poor foundation. This year, universities enrolled more than 65,000 new students, but there were only more than 43,000 high school graduates. After the living standards of urban and rural working people improved, a large number of primary school graduates demanded to enter secondary schools, but secondary schools were unable to accommodate them. For example, in East China this year, there were 540,000 primary school graduates, but only 350,000 entered junior high school, accounting for only 65% of the total number of primary school graduates. Before the summer vacation this year, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government formulated a national secondary school development plan, stipulating the enrollment tasks of secondary schools in major administrative regions. The results of our agency's reporters' investigations in various regions after the start of the autumn semester: generally, all regions have completed their enrollment tasks, and many regions have exceeded their original plans. For example, the Northeast region originally planned to enroll 112,400 students, but actually enrolled 157,048, exceeding the plan by more than 44,000.
    This year, when developing secondary schools in various regions, the priority was to establish new schools in rural areas. For example, the Subei area of East China newly established 27 secondary schools, and Zhejiang Province newly established 10 secondary schools. Most of these schools are located in small towns below the county and city level to facilitate the schooling of farmers' children. Cities generally only expanded on the basis of existing schools. For example, cities with more secondary schools originally, such as Shanghai and Nanjing, did not add new schools. The proportion of students with worker and peasant backgrounds among the new students enrolled in secondary schools in various regions this year has increased significantly. In the Northeast region, children of workers and peasants account for 72% of the new students enrolled in secondary schools this year. In Shanghai, children of workers and peasants account for 57.8% of the new students enrolled in secondary schools. In Guangzhou, children of workers and peasants account for 62.2% of the new students enrolled in secondary schools this year. Among the new students enrolled in public secondary schools in Chongqing, students with worker and peasant backgrounds account for 45.4%.
    The expansion and development of secondary schools has created difficulties in terms of teachers, school buildings, and equipment. Various regions are overcoming these difficulties with the spirit of tapping the potential of schools. The first is to expand the capacity of classes. In East China, each senior high school class has reached 50 students. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, most junior high schools in some areas have reached 60 students per class, exceeding the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government of 40 students per senior high school class and 50 students per junior high school class. This year, the southern region of Jiangsu Province increased the number of junior high school students by 31,000. According to the central standard, 620 classes would need to be added. Now, due to the expansion of class capacity, only 520 classes have been added, saving 20% of school buildings and teachers. Secondary schools in cities that have the conditions to implement a "two-shift system" have fully utilized school buildings and equipment after implementing the "two-shift system." Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places have opened some "two-shift system" secondary schools, which have greatly expanded the school's capacity and solved the problem of enrollment for many primary school graduates. Harbin No. 7 Middle School has only 16 classrooms. As a result of implementing the "two-shift system," 32 classes were opened, increasing the number of students by more than one time.
    Various regions have also used old school buildings and temples to solve the problem of school buildings in accordance with the principle of simplicity and making do with whatever is available. Some new school buildings have been built in necessary areas. Middle schools in various parts of Northeast China have built and repaired more than 93,900 square meters of bungalows and bought more than 840 houses. In addition, some regions have attached junior high school first-year classes to primary schools with better conditions, which not only solves the problem of school buildings, but also solves the problem of teachers. In addition to allocating more than 3,000 university graduates to serve as secondary school teachers this year, various regions have generally adopted methods of training and promoting teachers, promoting outstanding primary school teachers to junior high school teachers, promoting outstanding junior high school teachers to senior high school teachers, and transferring some school staff to serve as teachers; At the same time, some unemployed intellectuals are absorbed and trained in the short term to undertake teaching work. This autumn, Shenyang City promoted 221 outstanding primary school teachers and assigned them to teach in middle schools after short-term training, and some of them were directly assigned to teach in middle schools. This year, Anhui Province needed more than 1,000 middle school teachers, so it promoted more than 800 outstanding primary school teachers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国中学今秋已有相当规模的发展
    为了培养国家高级建设人材的后备力量和满足人民提高文化的要求，全国中学在今年秋季进行了相当规模的扩充和有重点的发展。据本社记者在各大行政区调查的材料统计，全国中学今年秋季招收新生九十八万九千八百二十七名，加上原来的在校学生，全国中学学生总数现已达到二百三十九万四千零七十二名，比一九四六年全国中学在校学生的最高数字增加百分之六十。
    发展中学是今后几年教育建设中的关键问题之一。目前中等教育特别是中学教育的发展，还远不能适应高等学校和小学的需要，形成了整个教育事业中的“蜂腰”状态。三年来我国高等教育和初等教育都有很大发展，全国高等学校在校学生今年秋季已由一九四九年的十三万多名发展到二十一万九千多名，全国小学生已由一九四九年的二千四百三十九万多名发展到四千九百万名。全国各地的中学三年来虽然已增加了一倍，但由于原有的底子差，仍然赶不上需要。今年高等学校招收新生达六万五千多名，而高中毕业生仅四万三千多名。全国城乡劳动人民生活改善后，大量小学毕业生要求进入中学，而中学却无法容纳。例如华东区今年小学毕业生达五十四万名，升入初中的只有三十五万名，仅占小学毕业生总数百分之六十五。中央人民政府教育部在今年暑假以前就拟定了全国中学发展的计划，规定了各大行政区中学的招生任务。本社记者在秋季开学以后在各地区调查的结果：各地一般都完成了招生任务，并有许多地区的中学招生超过了原定计划。如东北区原定招生十一万二千四百名，实际招生达十五万七千零四十八名，超过计划四万四千多名。
    今年各地在发展中学时，首先是在农村中有重点地建立新学校，如华东苏北地区就新办了二十七所中学，浙江省新办了十所中学。这些学校大部分分布在县、市以下的小城镇，以便利农民子弟上学。各地城市一般只在原有的基础上进行扩充，如上海、南京等原来中学较多的城市就没有增加新学校。各地中学今年招收的新生中，工农成分的学生显著增加。东北区中等学校今年所招新生中，工农子女占百分之七十二。上海市中等学校所招新生中，工农子女占百分之五十七点八。广州市中等学校今年招收的新生中，工农子女占百分之六十二点二。重庆市各公立中学招收的新生中，工农成分的学生占百分之四十五点四。
    由于中学的扩充和发展，就产生了师资、校舍和设备等方面的困难。各地正用大力发掘学校潜在能力的精神来克服这些困难。首先是扩大班级的容量。华东各地高级中学每班达到五十名，江苏和浙江部分地区的大部分初中每班已达六十人，超过中央人民政府教育部规定的高中每班四十名，初中每班五十名的标准。江苏省南部地区今年增加初中学生三万一千名，照中央标准须增加六百二十个班，现在由于扩大了班级的容量，仅增加了五百二十个班，节省了百分之二十的校舍和师资。城市有条件实行“二部制”的中学在实行“二部制”后，使学校校舍和设备得到了充分的利用。北京、沈阳、哈尔滨、上海、广州等地已开办了一些“二部制”的中学，大大地扩充了学校的容量，解决了不少小学毕业生的升学问题。哈尔滨第七中学只有十六个教室，实行“二部制”的结果，开了三十二个班，增加学生一倍以上。
    各地还根据因陋就简的原则，利用旧校舍、祠庙来解决校舍问题，必要的地区则修建了一部分新校舍。东北区各地中学已修建和修复了平房九万三千九百多平方公尺，买房子八百四十多间。还有些地区在条件比较好的小学内附设初中一年级班次，不仅解决了校舍的困难，同时也解决了师资问题。此外在解决师资方面，今年除分配了三千多名高等学校毕业生担任中等学校教师外，各地普遍采取培养和提拔教师的方法，将优秀的小学教师提升为初中教师，将优秀的初中教师提升为高中教师，并抽调一部分学校职员担任教师；同时吸收一部分失业知识分子加以短期训练后担任教学工作。沈阳市今年秋季提拔了二百二十一名优秀的小学教师，经过短期训练后担任中学教师，其中并有一部分直接分配到中学教课。安徽省今年需要一千多名中学教师，就提拔了八百多名优秀的小学教师。（新华社）
