    The Dollar's Overflow
    ——Travels in Toronto, Part Two
    Wu Wentao
    From Clothing to “Jokes”
    A customs officer at Gander Airport gave me a booklet published by the Canadian Department of External Affairs, a guide for travelers – “Canada – From Ocean to Ocean.” Thanks to this booklet, I got a bit of an “introduction” to Canada today: “From clothing to ‘jokes,’ everyday consumer goods throughout Canada are generally the same as in the United States.” (Page 64)
    Indeed, it is so. After settling down in Toronto, the first thing that strikes you is that U.S. dollars and their subsidiary coins are circulating in the market alongside Canadian dollars (one Canadian dollar equals US$1.50). Things like “Coca-Cola” drinks and “Camel” cigarettes, which are everywhere, are naturally American products. In all kinds of textiles, household appliances, cars... few are not made in the United States. If all of these can be categorized as material necessities, what about the spiritual life? Seventy or eighty percent of the films are Hollywood productions; the Republican and Democratic “election” circus in Chicago plays for a few days, and Canadian radio stations broadcast it for a few days; school textbooks (including elementary school textbooks) are mostly shipped from the United States, and most of the newspapers and magazines on newsstands are American publications.
    Here we can talk about "jokes." Friends told me the following facts: Two years ago, a miner who immigrated to Canada from Europe went down into a mine on his first day and discovered that his foreman was the manager of a notorious Nazi concentration camp during World War II. He quietly climbed back to the surface and reported it to the nearby police station, but the chief of police just shrugged and smiled. Recently, during a soccer game in Toronto, a young girl recognized the murderer who killed her father and mother among the soccer players. Driven by revenge, she ran to the police station to report him, but the result was that the police and military police did not arrest the murderer, and the murderer continued to play soccer as usual. These are all true stories published by Americanized Canadian bourgeois newspapers (often with pictures or even comic strips), and their purpose is simply to amuse people.
    However, even more popular are "joke" books imported from the United States. On any street corner newsstand in Toronto, you can see pamphlets costing a dime each, with bizarre covers. The content is nothing more than advocating wars of aggression, promoting racial discrimination, glorifying pornography, and treating murder and terrorism as games. Barbarism, degeneracy, and vulgarity permeate every page of the book, and the "American way of life" can be explained in detail within.
    It is said that these books are mainly for teenagers to read. As a result, many juvenile crime cases announced by the Canadian police and courts involve crimes such as murder, theft, and drug use. These children admit that they learned their criminal behavior from "joke" books. It is not known exactly how many American "joke" books are imported into Canada each year, but according to materials from the July 28th "Canadian Forum," the United States publishes 100 million copies of such "joke" books every month!
    Waterfalls
    The city of Toronto, with a population of 700,000, is located next to Lake Ontario. A few dozen kilometers southeast of here is Niagara Falls, which borders the United States. On July 28th, the Canadian Red Cross, as the host, invited delegates from various countries to see the falls.
    Soon after leaving the city, the host told everyone that "Ford Motor Company" was building the largest factory in all of Canada there. Then, our truck passed through a city called Hamilton and other villages and towns, and the names of many American companies such as "General Electric" were painted high on the walls. Have we arrived in the United States? No. The name of almost every major American company can be found within Canada. Although some add the word "Canada" in parentheses after the name, this does not change the essence of American capital.
    Standing on the riverbank opposite Niagara Falls, you can see a bridge several dozen feet long connecting Ontario, Canada, with New York State on the other side. Cars pass continuously on it. This is the so-called undefended border of nine thousand kilometers between the United States and Canada, where there is no visible boundary line. American capital, like the horseshoe-shaped waterfall, pours into Canada day and night.
    According to Canadian official statistics: As of the end of 1950, there were 2,568 large companies in Canada controlled by the United States (1,985 in 1945), of which 1,229 were manufacturing (announced by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics in April 1952). As of today, of course, it is more than this number. At the end of 1951, the official announcement was: The total foreign investment in Canada was more than 9.4 billion yuan (Canadian dollars); American investment increased from more than 6.5 billion yuan in 1950 to more than 7.2 billion yuan in 1951. It should be pointed out that these official figures do not cover the total amount of foreign investment. This is because it does not include the portion of profits earned in Canada by foreign capital each year that is reinvested in production.
    The American magazine "Fortune" in its August special issue on Canada, "Canada—The Businessman’s Country," said: "One-third of Canada's dividends and interest flow into the hands of Americans. They so often turn it into investments again that American property in Canada is currently about twice the accounting value of $7.5 billion."
    The reactionary "Fortune" magazine called Canada "the businessman's country" because "Howe and his men cooperate closely with the government to develop fiscal and tax policies that are favorable to industry and commerce. In Canada, there is, of course, no capital gains tax; corporate taxes are lower than in the United States; and there is no excess profits tax. High tax rates on consumer goods are a necessary source of revenue."
    What kind of person is this Mr. Howe? He is the current Minister of Trade, Commerce and Defense Production of the ruling Canadian Liberal Party federal government. In Ottawa (the capital of Canada), he is known as the "Minister of all problems." He is an American businessman who made a fortune by investing in Canada, became a Canadian citizen, and quickly became a high-ranking official!
    Rampage
    In the four months up to August of this year, almost all representative publications of the American bourgeoisie were vying to publish articles or special issues related to Canada. The common point in these is: America's natural resources are about to be exhausted, and Canada is an ideal place for American businessmen to make a fortune. Take action, quickly take action to buy Canada!
    In fact, Canada's natural resources have already been alarmingly "bought" by the Americans. Seventy-two percent of non-ferrous metal production is controlled by Americans. Sixty-five percent of the oil resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces directly or indirectly belong to the large American oil companies, and Canada's two major iron mines have also fallen into the pockets of American tycoons (April 28 "Canadian Forum").....
    Let's see how they buy them! In the westernmost region, fifty percent of the natural resources of British Columbia on the Pacific coast are timber. The American pulp trust "Celanese" leases 668,440 acres of forest from the provincial authorities for a rent of one U.S. cent per acre per year. The company is now in the process of increasing its lease by three million acres. This means that this American trust only needs to pay a rent of more than 36,000 U.S. dollars per year to indefinitely and arbitrarily exploit more than 3.6 million acres of forest!
    The "Imperial Oil Company," controlled by Mobil Oil, has recently leased 21 million acres of oil fields in Canada in the past four or five years. The so-called rent is only to hand over 4% to 10% of the value of the annual output of crude oil to the Canadian government. More than a thousand miles of oil pipelines stretch from northwestern Canada to the United States, almost free of charge, drawing Canada's natural blood. The situation with natural gas is the same.
    The iron mine in Ungers, Quebec, in the east, ships about 10 million tons annually to American steel furnaces from Pittsburgh to Chicago. The contract signed between the American Steel Company and the Canadian local government stipulates that during the eighty-year mining period, the lessee will pay an annual rent of 100,000 U.S. dollars - one U.S. cent per ton of iron ore! And when these iron sands are refined into steel and sold to Canadian manufacturing, each ton will cost at least 80 U.S. dollars.
    Of course, there is also a series of American military bases from the Canadian Arctic to Newfoundland.
    The notorious American magazine "Collier's," published on August 9, asked: "...So, would it be logical for the United States to merge with Canada?" The magazine's own answer is: "This may be logical. But it is not practical. The simple reason is: Canadians do not want to be merged."

    美元的泛滥
    ——多伦多纪行之二
    吴文焘
    从服装到“笑料”
    甘得尔航空站的一个海关职员送给我一本加拿大外交部出版的、专为旅客作向导的小册子——“加拿大—从海洋到海洋”。感谢这本小册子，我得到了一点关于今天加拿大的“入门”的介绍：“从服装到‘笑料’，在全加拿大的日用生产品，一般是和在美国的一样的。”（第六十四页）
    的确如此。在多伦多住下来，首先使人感到突出的，是美金及其辅币和加拿大金元（加币一元合美币一·五○元）一同在市场上流通着。到处充斥着的像“可口可乐”饮料，“骆驼”牌香烟这类东西，自然是美国货了；在各色纺织品、各种家庭用具、各式汽车……中，也很少不是美国制的。如果所有这些可以归纳作物质生活用品的话，那么，精神生活方面的情形怎样呢？十分之七八的影片是好莱坞出品；在芝加哥的共和党和民主党“竞选”的马戏演几天，加拿大的广播台就转播几天；学校里的教科书（包括小学课本）大都是从美国运来的，报摊上绝大部分的报纸杂志也是美国的出版物。
    这里可以谈到“笑料”了。朋友们告诉我这样的事实：两年前，一个从欧洲移居到加拿大来的矿工，头一天下到矿井里去，就发现他的领班是第二次大战期间的一个万恶的纳粹集中营的管理人。他悄悄地爬到地面上来，向附近的警察局报告，局长只是耸耸肩，笑了笑。最近，在多伦多的一次足球比赛中，一个少女从足球员中认出了杀死她父亲和母亲的凶手。她复仇心切，呼号着奔向警察局去检举，结果是：警宪无人来缉凶，凶手照常踢足球。这都是美国化了的加拿大资产阶级报纸登载的真事（经常还带着图画甚至连环画），其目的，只是为了博人一笑。
    但是，更流行的是美国进口的一种“笑料”书。在多伦多任何一个角落的书报摊上，你可以看到一角钱一本的、带着光怪陆离的封面的小册子，内容不外是鼓吹侵略战争，宣扬种族歧视，渲染色情和以杀人、恐怖行动当游戏的东西。野蛮、堕落、下流贯穿着书中的每一页，“美国生活方式”从里面可以得到详细的说明。
    据说，这类书主要是给十几岁的儿童们看的。于是，加拿大警察局和法院公布的儿童犯罪案件中，就有很多犯了杀人、盗窃、吸毒等罪。这些儿童供认他们的犯罪行为是从“笑料”书里学来的。不知道到底每年有多少本美国的“笑料”书进口到加拿大来，可是根据七月二十八日的“加拿大论坛报”的材料，知道美国每个月就出版一万万册这样的“笑料”书！瀑布
    七十万人口的多伦多城紧靠着安大略湖。从这里向东南走几十公里，就是与美国交界的尼亚加拉大瀑布。七月二十八日，作为东道主的加拿大红十字会，邀请各国代表们去看瀑布。
    出了城不久，招待员就告诉大家“福特汽车公司”正在那里建筑全加拿大最大的厂房。接着，我们的卡车穿过一个叫哈密尔敦的城市和另外一些村镇，“奇异电气公司”之类的许多美国公司的名字，高高漆在墙壁上。是到了美国吗？不是的。几乎每个美国大公司的名字，都可在加拿大境内找得到。虽然有些在名称后面的括弧里加上“加拿大”字样，这也改变不了美国资本的实质。
    站在尼亚加拉瀑布对面的河岸上，可以看到一座几十丈长的桥，把加拿大的安大略省和对岸的美国纽约州联结起来，汽车络绎不绝地在上面通过。这就是美、加间所谓九千公里不设防的、看不到边界线的边界。美国资本，就像那个马蹄形的大瀑布一样，日日夜夜向加拿大灌注着。
    根据加拿大官方的统计：截至一九五○年底止，在加拿大有二千五百六十八家由美国控制的大公司
    （一九四五年为一千九百八十五家），其中一千二百二十九家是制造业（一九五二年四月自治领统计局公布）。到今天，当然不止这个数字了。一九五一年底，官方公布：在加拿大的外国投资总数为九十四亿余元（加币）；美国投资，已从一九五○年的六十五亿余元增至一九五一年的七十二亿余元。应当指出：这些官方数字并不能概括全部外国投资的数量。因为它不包括每年外国资本将在加拿大所获利润重新投入生产的部分。
    美国的“幸福”杂志在今年八月的加拿大特刊
    “加拿大—商人的国度”中，就说：“加拿大的三分之一的红利和利息，流入美国人手中。他们是如此经常将它再变为投资，因之，美国在加拿大的财产目前大约是七十五亿美元会计价值的两倍。”
    反动的“幸福”杂志所以把加拿大称做“商人的国度”，这是由于“赫威和他手下的人们与政府密切合作，来发展与工商业者有利的财政和税收政策。在加拿大，当然没有资本收益税；公司税比美国要低；没有超额利润税。对于消费品的高额的税率，是必需的税收的来源。”
    这位赫威先生是怎样的人呢？他是现在当权的加拿大自由党联邦政府的贸易、商业兼国防生产部长；在渥太华（加拿大首都），人们称他为“一切问题的部长”。他就是一个在加拿大投资发了财、加入了加拿大国籍、很快又当了大官的美国商人！抢购
    到今年八月为止的四个月里，几乎所有美国资产阶级的有代表性的刊物，都竞相登载了有关加拿大的专文或特刊。这里面的共同论点是：美国的天然资源即将用尽了，加拿大是美国大商人们发财的理想地方。下手啊，赶快下手把加拿大买过来！
    其实，加拿大的天然资源已经可惊地被美国佬们“买”去了。百分之七十二的非铁金属生产是被美国人所控制的。阿尔伯达省和萨斯喀彻温省百分之六十五的石油富源直接间接属于美国的大油商们，加拿大两个主要的铁矿也已落到美国大亨们的口袋里（四月二十八日“加拿大论坛报”）……。
    看看他们是怎样买的吧！最西边，太平洋沿岸的英属哥伦比亚省天然富源的百分之五十是木材。美国的纸浆托辣斯“塞兰尼斯”，以每年每英亩一分美金的租金，向该省当局租得六十六万八千四百四十英亩的森林。该公司现在正进行增加租入三百万英亩。这就是说，这个美国托辣斯每年只须出三万六千余美元的租金，就可以无限期地任意地开采三百六十余万英亩的森林！
    美孚油公司所控制的“帝国石油公司”，最近四、五年来已在加拿大租有两千一百万英亩油田。所谓租金，那只是将年产百分之四到十的原油价值交给加拿大政府。一千多英里的排油管从加拿大西北部一直修到美国境内，几乎是无代价地把加拿大的天然血液抽了去。天然煤气的情况也是一样。
    东部魁北克省翁格斯地方的铁矿，每年约有一千万吨运到从匹兹堡到芝加哥一带的美国炼钢炉去。在美国钢铁公司和加拿大地方政府所签的合同中订着：八十年的开采期间，租方每年交付租金十万美金——一分美金一吨铁砂！而当这些铁砂炼成钢，卖给加拿大的制造业时，每吨就至少要八十美元。
    当然，还有从加拿大北极地带到纽芬兰岛的一系列美国军事基地。
    八月九日出版的臭名远扬的美国“柯里尔”杂志这样发问道：“……那么，让美国与加拿大合并起来是否合乎逻辑呢？”该刊自己的答案是：“这或者是合乎逻辑的。但这并不实际。简单的原因是：加拿大人不愿意被合并。”
