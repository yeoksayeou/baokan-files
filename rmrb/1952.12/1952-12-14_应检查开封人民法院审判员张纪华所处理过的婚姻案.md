To the Editor:

Zhang Jihua, a female adjudicator at the Kaifeng People's Court in Henan Province, has refused to study or accept criticism since joining the court. She holds serious erroneous ideas and does not handle cases according to the Marriage Law. Li Wenhua, a woman who was forced to marry Du Maicheng, has been living a life of suffering ever since. This year, Li Wenhua applied to the Kaifeng People's Court for a divorce, but Zhang Jihua refused, arguing that Du Maicheng "is a farmer" and "spent 120 silver dollars, which wasn't easy for him." In other cases where women were abused or beaten, Zhang Jihua treated them as simple divorce cases and ignored criminal acts that violated women's rights. She even said, "It doesn't matter if they are hit three or two times." During the "Three-Anti" movement, comrades criticized Zhang Jihua's thinking, but she said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I cannot accept opinions without principles." Her attitude is very arrogant, and her so-called "principle" is to reject criticism. Her erroneous thinking has also extended to interfering with her younger sister Zhang Jiying's freedom of marriage. Her sister is her child's nanny and is in love with Comrade Lao Zhai, a bailiff, but she threatened her, saying, "If you are with Lao Zhai, I will find another nanny; I'm not your sister anymore!" (Because Lao Zhai's "status" is low.) Zhang Jiying cried and said to other comrades, "My sister's marriage is free, so why won't she let me be free!" When other comrades gave Zhang Jihua advice, she said, "This is a family matter!"

As the judicial reform movement is now underway, we suggest that the leadership conduct a detailed inspection of the marriage cases handled by Zhang Jihua and hope that Comrade Zhang Jihua thoroughly reflects on and corrects her mistakes.

### 应检查开封人民法院审判员张纪华所处理过的婚姻案

    应检查开封人民法院审判员张纪华所处理过的婚姻案
    编辑同志：河南省开封市人民法院女审判员张纪华，自参加法院工作后，不肯学习，不接受批评，并有严重的错误思想，不依照婚姻法办案。妇女李文华自被迫和杜买成结婚后，一直过着痛苦的生活。今年，李文华向开封市人民法院要求离婚，张纪华竟认为杜买成“是个农民”，“花了一百二十元现洋不容易”，所以不准李文华离婚。在其他一些妇女受虐待、被打伤的案件中，张纪华也只是当作单纯的离婚案处理，对侵犯妇女人权的犯罪行为，不问不理。她还说：“打三拳两掌没关系”。“三反”运动时，同志们对张纪华的这种思想，曾经提出批评，但她却说：“我是共产党员，我不能无原则地接受意见。”她的态度很蛮横，她的所谓“原则”就是拒绝批评。她的错误思想还发展到干涉她妹妹张纪英的婚姻自由。她妹妹是她的孩子的褓姆，和法警老翟同志恋爱，但她却威胁说：“你要跟老翟，我另找褓姆，我也不是你姐姐！”
    （因老翟“地位”低）张纪英气得哭着向别的同志说：“我姐姐的婚姻是自由的，她为啥不让我自由呢！”又有同志向张纪华提意见时，她说：“这是家务！”
    现在正进行司法改革运动，我们建议领导上对张纪华所处理过的婚姻案件详细检查，并希望张纪华同志彻底反省，改正错误。
