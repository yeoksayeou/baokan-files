Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: The nationwide patriotic agricultural production increase campaign has concluded victoriously, achieving tremendous success. This year, China's total grain output increased by 15% compared to last year, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output by 9%. Total cotton output increased by 20% compared to last year, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output by 55.7%. The output of various other agricultural crops has also exceeded pre-war peak levels. Furthermore, countless examples of large-area high yields and new records surpassing last year's high-yield levels have emerged across various regions.

This year, a total of over 2.2 million agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations participated in the competition nationwide. The movement was carried out throughout the country, with the exception of a few frontier regions. The results of practice in various regions show that the patriotic agricultural production increase campaign is a good way to attract the broad masses of farmers to participate in national economic construction.

Due to the implementation of the competition movement, the people's government's policy of increasing yield per unit area has been transformed into the practical actions of the broad masses of farmers. This year, the enthusiasm shown by farmers in combating natural disasters, constructing agricultural water conservancy projects, improving agricultural techniques, and increasing production investment in order to increase production, and the achievements they have obtained, are unprecedented. This year, the locust plague that occurred on 28.74 million mu of land in eighteen provinces and regions was eradicated during the hopper stage. Farmers expanded the irrigated area by more than 23 million mu by building and repairing canals, sluice gates, ponds, dams, digging wells, and purchasing waterwheels with loans. The area of fertilized land nationwide reached 80%, and the amount of fertilizer applied increased by 30% compared to last year. The promotion of improved cotton varieties has reached 50% of the total cotton field planting area. Farmers visiting and learning from the farming methods of labor models has become a common phenomenon. They established "small farms," technical research groups, and high-yield demonstration plots to increase production. In the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions, where farming methods were previously relatively extensive, the amount of fertilizer applied and the number of cultivations of crops were generally increased this year. In Wuqizhuang Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province, there used to be two "chatting places." The masses called this place and the people who chatted there: "Old donkey market, rotten meat soup; teeth worn out from grinding, kang collapsed from sitting!" After the patriotic production increase competition was launched in the village this year, no one went to the "chatting places" anymore. In areas where the movement was carried out in depth, farmers' conservative ideas such as "producing to the limit" and "relying on the heavens for food" were greatly changed, and they further saw the unlimited potential of the land.

The implementation of the agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement strengthened the planning of farmers' production and promoted the advancement of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Both the mutual aid and cooperative organizations and individual farmers participating in the competition formulated patriotic production increase competition plans. Many plans are no longer simple agricultural arrangements, but rather, according to the policy of increasing yield per unit area, stipulate the methods and steps for improving agricultural techniques, increasing production investment, allocating labor organization, promoting products, and exchanging for necessary production and living materials. Two-thirds of the villages and one-third of the mutual aid groups in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi, have formulated three- to five-year construction plans. These plans are of great benefit to overcoming the blindness of small producers and combining the state's plans with the demands of the farmers. This year's cotton planting, after the people's government proposed controlling the cotton field area, avoided blindly expanding the cotton field because farmers generally formulated patriotic production increase plans, so that the state's cotton planting plan could be completed according to plan. The implementation of the competition movement has also promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The number of organized farming households nationwide has reached more than 35 million, an increase of 40% compared to last year. The quality of mutual aid and cooperative organizations has also greatly improved, and the number of long-term mutual aid groups in various regions has greatly increased compared to last year. The competition and mutual aid cooperation movements developed interactively, playing a huge role in increasing agricultural production.

The implementation of the patriotic production increase competition movement appropriately combined the economic and political lives of farmers and enhanced their political enthusiasm. All regions conducted patriotic production increase education for farmers during the movement. In some areas of Hebei Province, in addition to conducting patriotic production increase education for farmers, education on the future of social development, education on the worker-peasant alliance, and education on labor creating everything were also conducted. The number of farmers in Tangshan Special District who received these four types of education reached more than 2.5 million. Farmers in many places put forward slogans such as "Increase production patriotically, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea" and "Mutual aid and competition to produce more grain, build the country with strength."

The implementation of the patriotic production increase competition movement has also promoted various other tasks. The leadership in Hebei Province put forward the slogan "Patriotic production increase competition is the central task that overwhelms everything in the countryside," requiring all departments to carry out their work in the countryside around this center. As a result, the patriotic production increase competition movement was launched, the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production was high, the bean cakes that the supply and marketing cooperatives had originally found difficult to sell were quickly sold out; the Xinhua Bookstore's pamphlets on agricultural production were also sold in large quantities; the bank's agricultural production loans were timely and reasonably loaned out; and the financial department's task of collecting public grain was also successfully completed. Some farmers put forward slogans such as "Clean courtyards, clean streets" in the fertilizer accumulation competition, and the appearance of rural sanitation work also changed. Cadres who actively led production gained even greater support from the farmers.

The process of this year's patriotic production increase competition movement shows that there are many difficulties in making this movement as widespread and in-depth as possible. The general situation is: it is easy to stir things up, but difficult to go deep; it is easy to compete for a while, but difficult to implement it throughout the year; it is easy to develop it at individual points, but difficult to popularize it on a broad scale; it is easy to organize and mobilize, but difficult to provide ideological leadership; it is easy to lead from a single source, but difficult to coordinate multiple parties. In response to the above situation, many regions emphasized local agricultural production increase competitions and paid attention to carrying out "chain high-yield competitions" from the national scope to the province, to the special district, to the county, to the district, to the village, to the group, to the individual farmer, so that the movement was carried out vertically and horizontally in a chain. Various regions have also created many good experiences in promoting and deepening the competition movement. Xin Deng County, Zhejiang Province, created a "mass inspection system"; Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, created "typical chain demonstrations"; Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, created experience in promoting new farming methods; Hebei Province put forward the policy of "generally increasing yield per unit area and focusing on cultivating high-yield models." These have all played a positive role in the further in-depth development of the movement.

The shortcomings of this year's agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement are: the movement is not yet fully widespread and in-depth in various regions, and there is a tendency towards formalism in some areas. The main reason is that some rural workers do not have a deep understanding of the significance of this movement, so they oppose this task to other tasks, thinking that "other tasks are very busy, there is no way to compete," and cannot correctly combine the two to carry out. In individual regions, attention is paid to the cultivation and leadership of high-yield models in the competition, and insufficient attention is paid to the leadership of general production increase, thinking that "those with a yield per unit area of less than 800 jin are not considered to be competing," which restricts farmers from widely involving themselves in this movement. Again, the law of ideological development of farmers in the competition movement cannot be correctly grasped. In the early stage, no attention was paid to solving the various conservative ideas among farmers; in the later stage, no attention was paid to solving the various championshipism ideas among farmers, which affected the normal and in-depth development of the movement.

Currently, many regions are summarizing and accepting the experience of organizing the 1952 agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement in order to carry out this movement better in 1953 and further ensure the completion of agricultural production tasks.

### 全国农业增产竞赛运动成就巨大  粮棉产量超过战前最高额

    全国农业增产竞赛运动成就巨大
    粮棉产量超过战前最高额
    【新华社二十八日讯】全国农业爱国增产竞赛运动已经胜利结束，获得了巨大成就。今年我国粮食的总产量比去年增加百分之十五，超过战前最高年产量百分之九。棉花总产量比去年增加百分之二十，超过战前最高年产量百分之五十五点七。其他各种农作物的产量，也都超过了战前的最高水平。各地并出现了无数大面积丰产的范例，和超过去年丰产水平的新纪录。
    今年全国各地参加竞赛的农业互助合作组织共有二百二十多万个单位。全国除极个别的边疆地区之外，都开展了这一运动。各地实践的结果表明：农业爱国增产竞赛运动，是吸引广大农民参加国家经济建设的良好形式。
    由于竞赛运动的开展，人民政府提高单位面积产量的方针，变成了广大农民的实际行动。农民们今年为提高产量，在和自然灾害斗争、兴修农田水利、改进农业技术、增加生产投资等方面所表现的积极性和所获得的成绩，都是史无前例的。今年发生在十八个省、区内的二千八百七十四万亩的蝗虫灾害，在蝗蝻阶段就被扑灭。农民们以兴建和修整渠道、水闸、塘坝及打井、贷购水车扩大灌溉面积达二千三百多万亩。全国耕地的施肥面积，达到了百分之八十，施肥量比去年增加了百分之三十。棉花良种推广，已达到全部棉田播种面积的百分之五十。农民们参观学习劳动模范的耕作方法，成为普遍现象。他们为提高产量设立“小农场”、技术研究组、高额丰产田等。过去耕作方法较粗放的东北和内蒙古地区，今年普遍增加了施肥量和对农作物的铲趟遍数。河北省安国县五奇庄村过去有两个“聊天处”。群众称这个地方和聊天的人是：“老驴市，烂肉汤；磨断牙口，坐塌炕！”今年该村爱国增产竞赛开展以后，“聊天处”没有人去聊天了。运动开展深入的地区，农民“生产到顶”和“靠天吃饭”等保守思想大为改变，他们进一步看到了土地有无限潜力的情景。
    农业爱国增产竞赛运动的开展，加强了农民生产的计划性，并推动了农业互助合作运动的前进。参加竞赛的互助合作组织与个体农民都订出了爱国增产竞赛计划。许多计划已经不是简单的农事安排，而是根据提高单位面积产量的方针，规定了改进农业技术、增加生产投资、调配劳动力组织、推销产品和换取所需生产、生活资料的方法和步骤。山西长治专区有三分之二的村庄、三分之一的互助组订下了三年到五年的建设计划。这些计划，对克服小生产者的盲目性有很大好处，使国家的计划和农民的要求结合起来。今年的植棉，在人民政府提出控制棉田面积后，由于农民们普遍订立了爱国增产计划，就避免了盲目扩大棉田，使国家的植棉计划，得以按照计划完成。竞赛运动的开展，也推动了互助合作运动。全国组织起来的农户，已达三千五百多万户，比去年增加了百分之四十。互助合作组织的质量，亦有很大提高，各地长期互助组的数量较去年大大增多。竞赛与互助合作运动交互发展，对提高农业生产起了巨大的作用。
    爱国增产竞赛运动的开展，使农民的经济生活与政治生活得到了适当的结合，提高了农民的政治热情。各地区都在运动中对农民进行了爱国增产教育。河北省有些地区，除对农民进行爱国增产教育之外，还进行了社会发展前途教育、工农联盟教育、劳动创造一切的教育。唐山专区受到这四种教育的农民即达二百五十多万人。许多地方的农民们提出了“爱国多增产，抗美援朝鲜”，“互助竞赛多打粮，建设国家有力量”等口号。
    爱国增产竞赛运动的开展，也推动了其他各种工作。河北省领导方面提出了“爱国增产竞赛是农村压倒一切的中心工作”的口号，要求各部门在农村的工作都围绕这一中心来进行。结果，爱国增产竞赛运动开展起来了，农民增产的热情高涨起来了，供销合作社原来不易卖出去的豆饼，很快地卖出去了；新华书店有关农业生产的小册子，也大量卖出去了；银行的农业生产贷款，及时地合理地贷出去了；财政部门的公粮征收任务，也顺利地完成了。有些农民在积肥竞赛中，提出了“院光、街光”等口号，农村卫生工作的面貌也改观了。积极领导生产的干部，更加得到农民的拥护。
    今年爱国增产竞赛运动的过程说明要使这个运动做到最大限度的普及和深入，是有许多困难的。一般的情形是：轰起来容易，深入下去困难；一时竞赛容易，贯彻常年困难；点上开展容易，面上普及困难；组织动员容易，思想领导困难；单头领导容易，多方配合困难。针对上述情况，许多地区强调了地方性的农业增产竞赛，并注意开展从全国范围到本省、到专区、到县、到区、到村、到组、到个体农民的“连环丰产竞赛”，使运动纵横连环地开展起来。各地并创造了许多推广和深入竞赛运动的好经验。浙江省新登县创造了“群众性的检查制度”；江苏省松江县创造了“典型连环示范”；黑龙江省肇源县创造了推广新耕作方法的经验；河北省提出了“普遍提高单位面积产量，重点培养丰产典型”的方针。这些，对于运动进一步深入的开展，都起了良好的作用。
    今年农业爱国增产竞赛运动中的缺点是：运动在各地还不完全普及和深入，并在若干地区存在着形式主义的偏向。主要原因是一些农村工作人员对这一运动的意义认识得还不深刻，因而将这一任务和其他工作对立起来，认为“其他工作很忙，没办法竞赛”，不能将二者正确地结合起来进行。个别地区竞赛中注意高额丰产典型的培养和领导，对普遍增产领导注意不足，认为“单位产量不到八百斤者不算竞赛”，限制了农民广泛地卷入这一运动。再次，不能正确地掌握农民在竞赛运动中的思想发展规律。初期不注意解决农民中各种各样的保守思想；后期不注意解决农民中各种各样的锦标主义思想，都影响到运动正常深入的发展。
    目前许多地区正总结和接受一九五二年组织农业爱国增产竞赛运动的经验，以便在一九五三年将这一运动开展得更好，进一步保证农业生产任务的完成。
