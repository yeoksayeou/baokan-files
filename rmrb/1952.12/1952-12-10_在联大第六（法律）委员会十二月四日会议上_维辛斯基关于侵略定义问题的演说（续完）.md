    Three. The Bankruptcy of Legal Arguments Against Defining Aggression
    However, those who oppose defining aggression do not limit themselves to this aspect of the matter. They focus their attention on the legal aspect of the problem. We have already seen from above that they even deny the appropriateness of discussing the issue from a political angle, insisting on discussing its legal aspects.
    The legal aspect is, of course, very important and needs to be addressed by the Legal Committee. However, as the discussion nears its end, it is not appropriate to raise all the issues related to the legal aspect again, especially since these issues have already taken up a lot of time during the debates in the Sixth Committee.
    At the current stage of the discussion on the definition of aggression, I do not consider it necessary to discuss certain legal issues mentioned by some delegations here. I am referring to issues such as so-called indirect aggression, economic aggression, ideological aggression, and the like. Because these issues have only been mentioned in general terms, and because those who mentioned these issues do not intend to provide any definitions for these concepts, apart from spending some effort in this regard, it is not necessary to focus attention on these issues at present. However, I would like to talk about a few legal questions that have also been raised in this discussion. In the past few days, some new issues have been raised to obstruct the adoption of a definition of aggression. For example, to obstruct the adoption of a definition of aggression, it has been said that the General Assembly does not have the power to adopt a resolution on any definition, including the definition of aggression currently under discussion, unless it takes steps to amend the Charter.
    Those who raise this opinion say that neither the General Assembly nor the Security Council has the power to make so-called general interpretations of the Charter; the General Assembly and the Security Council can only interpret specific cases they must handle.
    Those who advocate this opinion regarding the definition of aggression, as well as the definitions of other concepts used in the Charter, regard the definition of the concept of aggression as an interpretation of the Charter, and indeed as an interpretation of the Charter in a general sense. Furthermore, they believe that interpretations of the various provisions of the Charter can only be proposed in the form of amendments to the Charter through the procedures stipulated in Chapter 18 of the Charter.
    The first question is: Is the definition of the concept of aggression, and the definition of any other concept used in the Charter, truly an interpretation of the Charter? We believe that it is incorrect to say that the definition of the concept of aggression is an interpretation of the Charter, because the key is not the interpretation of any concept used in the Charter, but the definition of the specific hallmarks of aggression, which are certainly not the same thing. According to Article 11 of the Charter, the United Nations General Assembly has the right to consider the general principles of cooperation in maintaining international peace and security, and therefore also has the right to consider the general principles of the struggle against aggression. Thus, the United Nations General Assembly has the right to determine those "specific hallmarks" that relevant bodies must use as criteria when deciding on this issue, when determining the existence of aggression, and the fact of aggression itself.
    It can thus be seen that the Soviet delegation's proposed definition of aggression is in complete accordance with the principles, purposes, and tasks of the United Nations, especially Article 11 of the Charter mentioned above.
    Therefore, amending the Charter is not necessary. Amending the Charter is only necessary when supplementing new principles or modifying old ones, when supplementing new purposes or modifying old ones, when stipulating new tasks not stipulated in the Charter or modifying tasks already stipulated in the Charter. Only in such cases is it necessary to amend and supplement the Charter. However, this is not the case here. The definition of aggression does not create new principles, new tasks, or new purposes. Everything is the same as in the Charter.
    The definition of aggression, which is to list the hallmarks of various acts that must be considered aggression, can be said to be a procedural or methodological issue, and therefore it does not affect the substance of the issue at all, because the substance of the issue has already been stipulated in the Charter.
    Therefore, it can never be said that the General Assembly and the Security Council can only interpret specific cases presented to them and encountered by them, and therefore the General Assembly is even less able than the Security Council to determine the definition of aggression. It would be absolutely wrong to say this. It can thus be seen that the so-called argument by certain representatives – such as the Belgian representative – that the key in this case lies in the interpretation of the Charter is unfounded, because there is no question of interpreting the Charter in this case. In this regard, there is no need to interpret the Charter, because, as we have already pointed out, the Charter makes sufficiently clear general provisions regarding maintaining international peace and security, eliminating threats to peace, and suppressing acts of aggression and other breaches of the peace.
    The so-called claim that the San Francisco Conference in 1945 believed that if interpretations were to be made according to general provisions, it would have to be done through procedures specifically formulated for amending the Charter is also unfounded. The special sub-committee of the committee on the issue of interpreting the Charter pointed out at the time: The sub-committee believes that it may be necessary to include interpretations in the amendments to the Charter in certain circumstances.
    It can be seen from this that it may only be necessary to do so in certain circumstances. This means that in some cases, it is not necessary. This is precisely the case with the issue of aggression. The reason why this is the case is because the concept of aggression does not need to be interpreted. It is only necessary to point out the various specific hallmarks. The importance and appropriateness of doing so has been recognized by the United Nations General Assembly, and the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, in the final analysis, are the main bodies of the United Nations for handling various issues within its scope.
    Therefore, the sentence mentioned above does not mean that in all cases it must be included in the amendment to the Charter, as an amendment to the Charter. Moreover, the definition of aggression may also be the result of various studies, and this research work is also one of the tasks of the United Nations.
    Another characteristic of the United Nations organization is that it is not only a political institution, but also an institution that is gradually developing in the legal field and has the right to interpret various special issues and make specific decisions or recommendations on these issues.
    In general, the United Nations General Assembly has no right to do anything beyond this scope. Article 13, paragraph 1, sub-item, of the Charter stipulates the possibility for the General Assembly to conduct research, as it says in this provision, "to promote international cooperation in the political field and encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification."
    Who can say that the work of the Sixth Committee, or the International Law Commission whose decisions must be reviewed by the Sixth Committee and the United Nations General Assembly, on determining the definition of aggression has nothing to do with the development of international law? On the contrary, this work is directly related to the task of developing international law. It is not without meaning that the original text of the Charter says "progressive development" of international law. This international law must be developed in order to ensure the realization of the excellent and lofty principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, especially in one of its chapters, which everyone must know and constantly remember.
    In this case, who can doubt the usefulness of the work of the Sixth Committee in drafting the definition of aggression in promoting the progressive development of international law and promoting international cooperation? In our view, such doubt is utterly impossible. The resolution of the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly considers this work to be useful, productive and necessary, and specifically designates the Seventh Session to complete this work. This resolution is correct.
    Unfortunately, due to the wrong handling of this issue, mainly due to the mistakes of the Secretary-General who is responsible for this matter, this work has not been completed.
    However, the Soviet delegation believes that despite the unsatisfactory work of the United Nations Secretariat, there is still complete material available to immediately adopt a definition of aggression, because such a definition is extremely important for international politics and for the development of international law. If the principles and foundations of international law are not respected, then neither the entire United Nations nor any of its institutions can function; neither the Security Council nor any other institution can function in accordance with the purposes and tasks of the United Nations.
    Four. The Soviet Proposal for a Definition of Aggression is an Important Contribution to International Peace and Security
    The issue of the right to self-defense has also been mentioned in the discussion. For example, it has been said that a country has the right to attack first for self-defense when it is threatened by aggression. This statement is entirely wrong. This statement can only be seen as justifying the right of one party to launch an armed attack on another under the pretext of self-defense.
    This statement is fundamentally flawed, and it only benefits the aggressor, giving the aggressor an excuse to use such pretexts to cover up its acts of aggression. The definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet delegation clearly states that any circumstances that are usually used as excuses for aggression cannot be used to justify aggression in the definition of aggression.
    Sections 2 and 3 of the draft definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet delegation clearly point out that no political, strategic, or economic considerations can be used as an excuse for the attacks mentioned in Section 1, that is, cannot be used as an excuse for one country to attack another country. The Soviet draft also lists the circumstances that cannot be used as excuses for such attacks.
    I think it is necessary to remind the committee to pay attention to Section 3 of our draft definition of aggression. This section says that if any country mobilizes or concentrates large numbers of armed forces near its borders, the country that feels threatened by such actions can take diplomatic or other measures to enable international disputes to be resolved peacefully. At the same time, it can also take similar military retaliatory measures as mentioned above, but must not cross the border. This section clearly and clearly answers the question of what measures a country can take for self-defense when it is threatened by the actions of another country. This section of our definition makes it impossible for aggressors who take certain actions for the purpose of attacking to exploit loopholes and justify their actions with fabricated excuses of self-defense.
    In contrast, the so-called statement that a country has the right to launch an attack first for self-defense when it is threatened by aggression, and the definition of aggression formulated according to this statement, allows the aggressor to exploit loopholes, allowing it to justify its aggression with fabricated excuses of self-defense. This is completely unacceptable and cannot be accepted in the definition of aggression.
    In view of all the facts mentioned above, the Soviet delegation insists on the definition of aggression it has proposed. The definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union blocks all loopholes in advance, preventing aggressors from using self-defense as an excuse to cover up their acts of aggression.
    Summarizing the results of the Sixth Committee's discussion on the definition of aggression, and after a detailed and careful study of all the views presented in the committee, the Soviet delegation considers it necessary to make the following declarations:
    (1) The discussion of this issue has proved that the position of those who oppose the definition of aggression is completely untenable. The arguments they have put forward to support their position cannot withstand criticism, these arguments have been refuted, and the facts presented to refute these arguments have irrefutably proved the great significance of the definition of aggression as an important means of consolidating peace and international cooperation.
    (2) The draft definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union meets all the requirements for formulating a definition of aggression. This is proven by the various treaties that the Soviet Union previously concluded with eleven countries on the basis of the same definition. At the same time, it is also proven by the Security Committee composed of representatives of seventeen countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in 1933.
    (3) The definition proposed by the Soviet Union contains various guiding principles for international organizations responsible for determining the attacking party, and stipulates that in international conflicts, any country that has carried out any of the actions listed in Section 1 of this definition will be regarded as an aggressor.
    (4) The definition proposed by the Soviet Union points out that the country that takes any of the following actions first will be regarded as the attacking party in an international conflict: (A) Declaring war on another country; (B) Armed forces invade the territory of another country without a declaration of war; (C) Bombarding the territory of another country with naval, land, and air forces, or deliberately attacking the ships and aircraft of another country; (D) Sending naval, land, and air forces into the territory of another country without the permission of the government of that country, or although permission was obtained in advance, it violates the agreed conditions, especially regarding the duration of the troops' stay and the scope of the garrison area; (E) Conducting a naval blockade of the coast or ports of another country.
    This definition also stipulates that a country will also be regarded as the attacking party in an international conflict if it "provides support to armed bandits who are organized on its territory and then invade the territory of another country, or refuses to take all measures within its power to cancel the assistance or protection obtained by these bandits on its own territory, despite the demands of the invaded country."
    This kind of action is also a clear and obvious act of attack, which eliminates all doubts and disputes about whether a country's use of force constitutes an attack on others. Such a definition of aggression makes it easier for us to expose the attacking party and prevent various attempts to conceal or whitewash the aggressor for some political purpose.
    The definition proposed by the Soviet Union specifically points out that no political, strategic, or economic considerations, nor the desire to develop natural resources or obtain any other benefits or privileges in the territory of the attacked country, nor the existence of substantial investment or any other special rights and interests in that country, nor the claim that the territory does not have the salient characteristics of a country – none of these can be used as an excuse for the attacks referred to in Section 1.
    This section is a very important section. It truly arms the organization responsible for declaring the attacking party as the aggressor and pointing out who the attacking party is, enabling this organization to successfully complete its task.
    We must also point out that the Soviet definition points out that the following situations cannot be used as an excuse for attack: (1) The internal situation of a country, such as:
    (A) The political, economic, or cultural backwardness of the people of a certain nation; (B) Deficiencies belonging to the administrative aspect of the country; (C) Dangers that may threaten the lives or property of foreigners; (D) Revolutionary or counter-revolutionary movements, civil wars, disturbances, or strikes; (E) The establishment or maintenance of some or other political system, economic system, or social system in any country.
    (2) The actions, legislation, and orders of a country, such as: (A) Violations of international treaties; (B) Infringement of the rights and interests obtained by another country or its citizens in terms of commerce, concession rights, or any other economic activities; (C) Severance of diplomatic or economic relations; (D) Adoption of economic or financial boycott measures; (E) Repudiation of foreign debts; (F) Prohibition or restriction of the entry of foreigners or changes in the management methods of foreigners; (G) Infringement of the privileges enjoyed by the formal representatives of another country; (H) Refusal to allow the passage of armed forces bound for the territory of a third country; (I) Measures of various religious or anti-religious nature; (J) Border incidents.
    The definition proposed by the Soviet Union pays special attention to the circumstances listed in Section 3, item 13: If any country mobilizes or concentrates large numbers of armed forces near its borders, the country that feels threatened by such actions can take diplomatic or other measures to enable international disputes to be resolved peacefully.
    Item 13 of Section 3 of the Soviet proposal points out that this country can simultaneously take similar military retaliatory measures, but must not cross the border.
    The Soviet delegation believes that it is important and necessary to adopt a resolution on the definition of aggression without delay.
    The proposal made by the Soviet Union on this issue has been supported by many countries, and provides ample opportunities for an early and satisfactory solution to this important issue, which is conducive to the consolidation of peace and international security.

    在联大第六（法律）委员会十二月四日会议上
    维辛斯基关于侵略定义问题的演说（续完）
    三、反对确定侵略概念者的法律论据的破产
    不过，反对确定侵略概念的人并不把他们自己局限在事情的这一方面。他们把注意力集中在这个问题的法律方面。我们从上面已看出，他们甚至否认从政治角度来讨论这个问题是适宜的，他们坚持要讨论这个问题的法律方面。
    法律方面当然是很重要的，法律委员会需要加以注意。但是，现在讨论已接近结束，如果再提出所有与法律方面有关的问题是不适宜的，尤其是因为这些问题在第六委员会的辩论中已经花了很多时间讨论过了。
    在讨论关于侵略定义问题的目前阶段，我认为不必要讨论这里有些代表团所谈到的某些法律问题。我这里指的是所谓间接侵略、经济侵略、思想侵略等类问题。由于这些问题只是笼统地提到，由于提到这些问题的人除了在这方面花了一些气力外，并不想对这些概念作出任何定义，所以目前不需要集中注意力在这些问题上。但是我愿意谈一下也是在这次讨论中提出的几个法律问题。在以往几天中，有人提出了某些新的问题，以阻挠通过侵略定义。例如，为了阻挠通过侵略定义，有人说，大会除了采取修改宪章的步骤外，它没有权力来通过关于任何定义的决议，没有权力来通过目前讨论的侵略定义的决议。
    提出这种意见的人说，无论大会或安全理事会，都没有权力对宪章作所谓一般意义的解释，大会与安全理事会只可以解释它们必须处理的各项具体事案。
    鼓吹这种关于侵略定义以及宪章中使用的其它概念的定义的意见的人，把对于侵略概念的定义看作是对宪章的解释，而且是对宪章的一般意义的解释。此外，他们认为对宪章的种种规定的解释，只能通过宪章第十八章所规定的程序以修改宪章的形式提出。
    第一个问题就是：侵略概念的定义和宪章中使用的任何其它概念的定义，真是对宪章的解释吗？我们认为，说侵略概念定义是对宪章的解释，是不正确的，因为问题的关键不是对宪章中使用的任何概念的解释，而是关于侵略的具体标志的定义，这当然不是一个东西。根据宪章第十一条，联合国大会有权考虑关于维持国际和平和安全之合作的普通原则，因此，也有权考虑关于反对侵略斗争的普通原则。这样，联合国大会就有权来确定那些“具体标志”，有关机构在决定这个问题、在确定侵略的存在和侵略的事实本身的时候，必须以此为准绳。
    由此可见，苏联代表团提出的侵略定义的建议，完全符合联合国的原则、宗旨和任务，特别是上述宪章第十一条。
    因此，修改宪章是不必要的。只有在补充一些新原则或修改旧原则的时候，只有在补充一些新宗旨或是修改旧宗旨的时候，只有在规定宪章中所没有规定的新任务或是修改宪章中已经规定的任务的时候，才需要修改宪章。只有在那样情况下才需要修改和补充宪章。但是，这里并未发生这种事情。侵略的定义没有产生新的原则、新的任务或是新的宗旨。什么东西都和宪章上的一样。
    侵略定义就是列举必须被认为是侵略的各种行为的标志，这可以说是一个程序或方法问题，因此，它一点也不影响问题的实质，因为问题的实质已经在宪章中规定了。
    所以，决不能说：大会和安全理事会只能解释向它们提出来的和它们所遇到的具体事案，并且因此大会比安全理事会更不能确定侵略定义。如果这样说，那是绝对错误的。由此可见，某些代表——如
    比利时代表——所谓在这种情况下问题的关键在于对宪章的解释的说法，是没有道理的，因为在这种情况下，谈不到任何解释宪章的问题。在这一方面，不需要解释宪章，因为，像我们已经指出，宪章足够明确地作出了关于维持国际和平与安全、消除对于和平的威胁和制止侵略行为和其他破坏和平的行为的一般规定。
    所谓在一九四五年的旧金山会议上认为，若按照一般规定来进行解释，必须通过专为修改宪章而制定的程序，这种说法也是没有根据的。关于解释宪章问题的委员会的特别小组委员会在当时曾指出：该小组委员会认为把解释包括在对宪章的修正案内，在某种情况下可能是必要的。
    由此可知，只有在某种情况下，这样做才可能是必要的。这就意味着：可能在某些情况下，这就没有必要。这种情况正就是我们在侵略问题上的情况。这种情况之所以如此，是因为侵略的概念并不需要解释。只需要指出各种具体的标志。关于这样做的重要性和适宜性已为联合国大会所承认了，联合国大会和安全理事会，最后分析起来说，是联合国处理它范围内各项问题的主要机构。
    因此，上面所提到的那句话并不是说在所有情况下都必须将其包括入宪章的修正案中，作为对宪章的修改。不但如此，侵略的定义也可能是各种研究的结果，而这种研究工作也是联合国的任务之一。
    联合国组织还有一个特点，就是：它不仅是一个政治机构，而且它也是在逐渐发展法律方面有权阐释各种特别问题并就这些问题作出具体决定或建议的一个机构。
    一般说来，联合国大会无权超出这个范围做任何事。宪章第十三条第一款子项规定大会有进行研究的可能性，如这条规定中所说，“以促进政治上之国际合作，并提倡国际法之逐渐发展与编纂”。
    谁能说第六委员会或是那个它的决定一定要经过第六委员会与联合国大会审查的国际法委员会关于确定侵略定义的工作与国际法的发展没有关系呢？相反的，这项工作正与发展国际法的任务有着直接关系。宪章原文说，“逐渐发展”国际法并不是没有意义的，这种国际法一定要加以发展，以便保证实现联合国宪章特别在其一章中所规定的卓越与崇高的原则，这一章是每一个人必须知道并且经常记住的。
    在这种情况下，谁能怀疑第六委员会草拟侵略定义的工作对于推动国际法的逐渐发展与促进国际合作方面的用处呢？在我们看来，这种怀疑是全然不可能的。联合国第六届大会的决议认为这项工作是有用的、可以得到结果的与必要的，并特别指定由第七届大会来完成这项工作。这个决议是正确的。
    不幸的是：由于对这个问题的错误处理方法，主要是由于对这事负责的秘书长的错误，这项工作没有能完成。
    可是，苏联代表团认为，尽管联合国秘书处的工作不能令人满意，现在仍然有完备的材料，可以立即通过一个侵略定义，因为这种定义对于国际政治，对于发展国际法是极其重要的。如果不尊重国际法的原则与基础，那么，不论是整个的联合国或它的任何机构都是不能进行工作的；不论是安全理事会或其他任何机构也都不能按照联合国的宗旨与任务进行工作。
    四、苏联关于侵略定义的建议是对国际和平与安全的重要贡献
    自卫权利的问题，在讨论里也有人提到。例如，有人说，在一个国家受到侵略的威胁时，它有权首先进攻以进行自卫。这种说法是十分错误的。这种说法只能看做是为一方有权藉口自卫而对另一方发动武装进攻辩解。
    这种说法是有基本缺陷的，它只对侵略者有利，使侵略者得到了一个藉口，以便用这类藉口来掩饰它的侵略行为。苏联代表团所提出的侵略定义很清楚地说明，侵略的定义中应该规定：一切平常作为侵略藉口的情况都不能用来为侵略辩解。
    苏联代表团所提出的侵略定义草案第二节和第三节，明白地指出政治上、战略上或经济上的任何考虑都不能作为第一节中所提到的进攻的藉口，也就是不能作为一个国家进攻另一个国家的藉口。苏联草案并列举了不能作为这种进攻的藉口的情况。
    我认为有必要提醒委员会注意我们的侵略定义草案第三节。这一节说，倘若任何一个国家在其边境附近动员或集结大批武装部队，由于这种行动而感到威胁的那个国家就可以采取外交的或其他的方法，使国际争端能够和平解决。它同时也可以采取与上述相类似的军事性的报复措施，但不得越过国界。这一节明确而清楚地回答了一个国家在受到另
    一个国家的行动的威胁时，为了自卫可以采取什么措施的问题。我们的定义的这一节，使那些为了进攻而采取某种行动的侵略者，无法钻空子，无法用捏造的自卫的藉口替自己的行动辩解。
    与此相反，所谓一个国家在受到侵略威胁的时候权为了自卫首先发动进攻的说法以及依照这种说法制订的侵略定义，则使侵略者有空子可钻，使它可以用捏造的自卫藉口为它的侵略行动辩解。这是完全不能允许的，也是在侵略定义中不能接受的。
    鉴于上面所说的一切事实，苏联代表团坚持它提出的侵略定义。苏联提出的侵略定义事先就堵住了一切漏洞，使侵略者不能藉口自卫来掩饰它的侵略行动。
    苏联代表团总结第六委员会关于侵略定义问题进行讨论的结果，并在详尽而仔细地研究了在委员会上提出的一切观点之后，认为有必要作下列几点声明：
    （一）这个问题的讨论已经证明了反对侵略定义的人们的立场是完全站不住脚的。他们提出来支持他们的立场的论据，是经不起批判的，这些论据都遭到了驳斥，同时为了驳斥这些论据而提出的事实，已经无可辩驳地证明了，侵略定义的重大意义在于它是巩固和平及国际合作的一个重要手段。
    （二）苏联所提出的侵略定义草案符合关于制订一个侵略定义的一切要求。这一点从苏联在以前与十一个国家在同样定义的基础上缔结的各项条约中可以得到证明。同时，从一九三三年由美国、英国、法国、苏联等十七国的代表组成的安全委员会中也可以得到证明。
    （三）苏联所提出的定义包含了对于那些负责确定进攻一方的国际机构的各项指导原则，并规定，在国际冲突中，凡是进行了这个定义第一节内列出的任何一种行动的国家，将被视为侵略者。
    （四）苏联提出的定义指出：第一个采取下列任何一种行动的国家将被视为国际冲突中的进攻的一方：（甲）对他国宣战；（乙）武装部队未经宣战而进犯他国领土；（丙）以海、陆、空军轰击他国领土，或有意地袭击他国船只和飞机；（丁）未获他国政府的许可，把海、陆、空军开入该国领土，或是事先虽然获得许可，但是违反商定的条件，特别是关于部队驻留的期限以及驻军地区的范围的条件；（戊）对他国的沿海或港口进行海上封锁。
    这个定义并且规定：一个国家如果“对于在它的领土上组织起来然后再侵入另一个国家领土的武装匪徒给以支持，或是不顾被侵国家的要求，拒不在它自己的领土上采取能力所及的一切措施，取消这些匪徒所得的援助或保护”，那也将被视为国际冲突中的进攻一方。
    这种行动也就是明明白白的进攻的行动，这便消除了关于一个国家一旦使用武力是否就算是对他人进攻的一切怀疑和争论。这样一个侵略定义，就使我们便于揭露进攻的一方，并防止为了某种政治目的而多方隐瞒或粉饰侵略者的种种企图。
    苏联所提出的定义特别指出：不论是政治上、战略上或经济上的任何考虑，也不论是想在被进攻的国家的领土上开发自然资源或取得任何其他利益或特权，也不论是在那个国家领土上有相当大的投资或任何其他特殊权益，也不论是说这个领土没有一个国家的显著特征——所有这些，都不能当作第一节中所指出的进攻的藉口。
    这一节是很重要的一节，它真正把负有责任宣布进攻的一方为侵略者和指出进攻的一方是谁的机构武装起来，使这个机构能够圆满地完成它的任务。
    我们还必须指出，苏联定义指出下列情况不能当作进攻的藉口：（一）某一国家的内部状况，例如：
    （甲）某一民族人民在政治上、经济上或文化上的落后；（乙）属于该国行政方面的缺点；（丙）可能威胁外国人的生命或财产的危险；（丁）革命的或反革命的运动、内战、动乱或罢工；（戊）任何国家中建立或保持某种或他种政治制度、经济制度或社会制度。
    （二）一个国家的行动、立法和命令，例如：（甲）违背国际条约；（乙）侵犯另一个国家或其公民所取得的在商业方面、让与权方面或任何其他经济活动方面的权利与利益；（丙）断绝外交关系或经济关系；（丁）采取经济的或财政的抵制措施；（戊）否认外债；（己）禁止或限制外侨入境或变更外侨管理办法；（庚）侵犯另一国家的正式代表所享受的特权；（辛）不准开往第三国领土的武装部队过境；（壬）关于各种宗教性质或反宗教性质的措施；（癸）边境事件。
    苏联所提出的定义特别注意第三节十三点所列举的情况：倘若任何一个国家在其边境附近动员或集结大批武装部队，由于这种行动而感到威胁的那个国家就可以采取外交的或其他的方法，使国际争端能够和平解决。
    苏联提案第三节十三点指出：这个国家可以同时采取相类似的军事性的报复措施，但不得越过国界。
    苏联代表团认为，毫不迟延地通过关于侵略的定义的决议是很重要而且必要的。
    苏联在这个问题上提出的建议已经得到许多国家的支持，并为尽早圆满解决这个重要问题以利和平与国际安全的巩固，提供了充分的机会。
