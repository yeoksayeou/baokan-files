    [This Newspaper’s Report] The Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government convened a National Geological Work Plan Conference in Beijing from November 17th to December 8th, and formulated the 1953 geological exploration plan. Participants in the conference included: heads of exploration teams directly under the Ministry of Geology, heads of geological bureaus of major administrative regions, and planning, geological, financial, and supply personnel, as well as representatives from relevant industrial departments of the Central People's Government. Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government and Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, gave important instructions to the participants on December 4th (full text to be published separately).

    At the beginning of the meeting, Li Siguang, Minister of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, made a report on the guiding principles for formulating the plan, and put forward the tasks of geological work in 1953. He first analyzed the domestic and international situation, and put forward the requirements of large-scale national economic construction for geological work. He emphasized that geological work should serve industrial construction, and specifically explained the content and scope of the geological work plan, the key points of the plan projects, and the guiding ideology for making the plan. Finally, he particularly emphasized that geological work should be combined with the masses, promote the experience of mass ore reporting, and organize a broad mass ore reporting movement.

    According to the needs of national economic construction, the task of geological work in 1953 is unprecedentedly huge, but the current geological work force is very weak. The weakness of the geological work force is manifested on the one hand by the insufficient number of geological personnel, and on the other hand by the lack of practical exploration experience of geological personnel. Due to this situation, an incorrect understanding was reflected at the meeting, that is, emphasizing the complexity of geological work, the importance of the task, and the shortage of cadres, which led to conservatism and a reluctance to take bold responsibility. The meeting focused on criticizing this conservative thinking of not actively overcoming difficulties and the thinking of not daring to take responsibility. It was unanimously agreed that geological work must catch up with the needs of large-scale national economic construction, serve national industrial construction, and not delay the progress of national construction due to the insufficient existing strength of geological work. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to increase strength and complete the work required by the state. Based on this understanding, the meeting proposed the guiding principle of ensuring the completion of key exploration, conducting general surveys in a planned and focused manner, and boldly developing forces to meet the needs of economic construction and create conditions for larger-scale resource exploration tasks next year. The meeting also arranged the national geological work projects according to the requirements of the state for geological work, prioritized them, made detailed designs for key exploration, and initially formulated technical quotas for geology, surveying, drilling, trenching, and tunneling, thereby calculating the amount of geological exploration work in 1953. Soviet experts provided detailed assistance in determining the key exploration plan.

    The workload of the Ministry of Geology in 1953 is huge. Drilling, geology, and topographic surveying will exceed ten times this year, and trenching and tunneling will exceed twenty-three times. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient strength, the meeting accurately calculated the existing manpower, striving to use the minimum manpower to exert the maximum efficiency and complete the maximum amount of work. The meeting also determined that next year, 60 percent of the strength will be used to ensure the completion of key exploration tasks for non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, and coal, and deliver the required mineral data to the state on schedule, and supply the relevant industrial departments with designs; 16 percent of the strength will be used to carry out general surveys with focus, in order to discover more mineral deposits and prepare for key detailed and refined surveys in 1954; a certain amount of strength will be used to complete the most important engineering geological work, and strengthen the geological education force, so as to train a large number of technical staff.

    In order to ensure the realization of the above plan, the meeting decided that in addition to the rational use of talents, it is more important to use the most effective methods to train a large number of technical cadres and workers. The plan for 1953 is to increase strength tenfold. To this end, it was decided to run Beijing and Changchun Geological Colleges well, and to run six secondary technical schools by the Ministry of Geology and the geological bureaus of major administrative regions. In addition, the method of "working, teaching, and learning at the same time" is used in the work to "take on apprentices" in large numbers to meet the urgent needs of the current work.

    The meeting also studied the issues of organization and leadership relations, and determined that it is necessary to end the current state of scattered forces and implement unified and centralized leadership by the Ministry of Geology, unified planning, and unified allocation of manpower and materials. The geological bureaus of the major administrative regions are the dispatched agencies of the Ministry of Geology. In order to ensure the completion of key tasks, the meeting determined that the key exploration teams dispatched by the Ministry of Geology are directly led by the Ministry of Geology and are also supervised by the local geological bureaus.

    全国地质工作计划会议确定
    培养力量重点勘察资源
    陈云副总理、李四光部长作了指示和报告
    【本报讯】中央人民政府地质部，于十一月十七日到十二月八日，在北京召开了全国地质工作计划会议，制订了一九五三年的地质勘察计划。参加这次会议的有：地质部直属勘探队，各大行政区地质局的负责人和计划、地质、财务、供应人员，以及中央人民政府各有关工业部门的代表。中央人民政府政务院副总理、政务院财政经济委员会主任陈云，于十二月四日向到会人员作了重要指示（全文另发）。
    会议开始时，中央人民政府地质部李四光部长作了关于制订计划的方针原则的报告，提出了一九五三年地质工作的任务。他首先分析了国内外的情况，提出了国家大规模经济建设对地质工作的要求。他着重指出地质工作要为工业建设服务，并具体地说明了地质工作计划的内容、范围，计划项目的重点，及作计划的指导思想。他最后特别强调地质工作要与群众相结合，推广群众报矿的经验，组织广大群众性的报矿运动。
    根据国家经济建设的需要，一九五三年地质工作的任务是空前巨大的，但目前的地质工作力量，则十分薄弱。地质工作力量的薄弱，一方面表现在地质人员不够，一方面表现在地质人员缺乏实际勘探工作的经验。由于这种情况的存在，会议上反映出一种不正确的认识，就是强调地质工作复杂、任务重大、干部不足，从而产生了保守思想和不敢大胆负责的思想。会议着重批判了这种不积极克服困难的保守思想和不敢负责的思想，一致认为地质工作必须迎头赶上国家大规模经济建设的需要，为国家工业建设服务，不能因地质工作的现有力量不足而推迟国家建设的进度，因而必须找出增加力量的方法，完成国家所需要的工作。在这样的认识基础上，会议提出了明年要保证完成重点勘探，有计划有重点地进行普查，放手发展力量，迎头赶上经济建设需要，为更大规模的资源勘察任务创造条件的方针。会议并根据国家对地质工作提出的要求，分别轻重缓急，排列了全国地质工作项目，作出了重点勘探的详细设计，初步制定了地质、测量钻探、坑探、洞探的技术定额，从而计算了一九五三年的地质勘察工作量。在确定重点勘探的计划时，苏联专家进行了详尽的帮助。
    地质部一九五三年的工作量是巨大的，钻探、地质、地形测量将超过今年十倍，槽探、洞探将超过二十三倍。为了解决力量不足的困难，会议精确计算了现有的人力，力争以最小限度的人力，发挥最大的效率，完成最大限度的工作。会议并根据这些方针和任务，确定了明年以百分之六十的力量，保证完成有色金属，黑色金属及煤炭的重点勘探任务，按期交给国家要求的矿量资料，供给有关工业部门设计；以百分之十六的力量有重点地开展普查，以便更多地发现矿藏，为一九五四年重点详查、精查作准备；以一定的力量完成最重要的工程地质工作，并加强地质教育力量，以培养大批的技术员工。
    为保证以上计划的实现，会议决定：除了合理使用人材以外，更重要的是用最有效的办法，培养训练大批的技术干部和工人。一九五三年计划增长力量十倍。为此，确定办好北京、长春两个地质学院，并由地质部及各大行政区地质局举办六所中等技术学校。此外，在工作中用“边作、边教、边学”的办法，大量“带徒弟”，以适应目前工作的急需。
    会议又研究了机构和领导关系问题，确定必须结束目前力量分散的状态，实行由地质部统一集中的领导，统一计划、统一人力物力的调配。各大行政区的地质局，为地质部的派出机关。为保证各重点任务的完成，会议确定：地质部派出的重点勘探队，由地质部直接领导，同时受所在地区地质局的监督。
