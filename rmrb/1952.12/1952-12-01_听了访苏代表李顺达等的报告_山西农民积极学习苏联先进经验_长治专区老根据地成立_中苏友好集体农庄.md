After Listening to Reports from the Visiting Soviet Delegation Led by Li Shunda and Others, Shanxi Farmers Actively Study Advanced Soviet Experiences; "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" Established in the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Changzhi Prefecture

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," Shanxi Province organized six farmer representatives, including Li Shunda and Zhang Desheng, who had returned from visiting the Soviet Union, to go to various places to report on their experiences and observations in the Soviet Union. Each representative brought a film crew and screened Soviet films for the audience. Wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by the masses. From November 1st to 10th, in the fifteen reports they made in seven counties, the audience reached 58,041 people. Hebian Village in Dingxiang County originally planned to send only forty-odd village cadres, party members, and propagandists to listen to the lectures, but after the masses heard the news, more than twenty people voluntarily went to participate.

All the listeners were very concerned about the production and living conditions of the Soviet people. After each report, the farmers would organize discussions. They raised many questions in the discussions and asked the representatives to answer them. The questions raised by the farmers covered a wide range, such as: How did collective farms develop? How is private land cultivated? How is the fruit of labor distributed? How are workdays evaluated? How do the old, weak, and disabled live? Are the villagers' houses publicly or privately owned? How do Soviet farmers sell their surplus products? And so on. The representatives gave detailed answers to these questions.

After listening to the reports, the masses' level of awareness was further improved. They became more enthusiastic about the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, and at the same time, they saw their bright future. Li Wenxuan, a party member from a farmer's background in Jiexiu County, said: "In the past, the leading comrades said not to eat from the same big pot, and I always had some doubts in my heart. This time, the representatives showed us with our own eyes, and our confused thinking has been resolved." Yang Xiquan, a farmer from the Fourth District of Jiexiu, said: "This report really solved my problem. I have twelve children, and I used to think that in any society, if there are too many people, there will be no good life. Who knew that in the Soviet Union, if you have more children, you are rewarded by the government. The Soviet Union is really great." The farmers in the mountainous areas heard about the rich harvests that the people in the mountainous areas of the Soviet Union had obtained by raising dairy cows, planting trees, and raising silkworms, and they all recognized the future development of their mountainous areas. Zhang Wenxiu and Xue Xinwen, labor models from the Fifth District of Lingshi County, said: "Now we truly understand that mountainous areas can also reach socialist society. We must work hard to produce and strive for its early arrival."

Learning from the advanced production experiences of the Soviet Union has become an increasing demand of Shanxi farmers. Cadres and farmers who have listened to the reports are very envious of the fact that the Soviet Union uses machines to replace hard labor. Han Yuchuan, deputy village chief of Zhangzhao Village in Dingxiang County, said: In the past, the superiors asked us to organize and take the Soviet road, but I didn't believe that mutual aid teams could reach collective farms. Now I know that Soviet collective farms also developed from small to large. I must lead the mutual aid team well, and in the future, we can form a collective farm and use machines. The secretary of the Communist Party branch of Liujiajian Village in Yongji County said: The Soviet Union has protective forest belts to overcome natural disasters. I must promote this to the masses and respond to the government's call to plant more trees to prevent floods and droughts. Han Genhu, the secretary of the Communist Party branch of Daiyang Village, originally thought that his village had already pressed 3,000 carts of corn stalks as fertilizer, which was almost enough; after listening to the report on the use of fertilizer in the Soviet Union, he felt that it was far from enough and decided to accumulate more fertilizer. The Jishan County Cultural Center has now stipulated that the 7th of each month is "Learn from the Soviet Union Day." After listening to the reports, the teachers and students of Jishan Middle School and primary schools submitted suggestions to their superiors, requesting permission to go to the countryside to promote the living conditions of the Soviet people and the advanced production experiences of the Soviet Union.

Also reported: The collective farm with 920 peasant households experimentally operated in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, has been officially established on November 16 after four months of active preparation. This is currently a relatively large collective farm in the inland rural areas of our country. At the official establishment meeting of the farm, all the members unanimously approved: to name this collective farm "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm". The meeting also produced the Collective Farm Management Committee and elected the farm chairman and members. In addition to all the members, more than 1,200 nearby farmers attended the establishment meeting of the collective farm.

The "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" is located in the center of the "Shangdang Basin" of the Taihang Mountains, between Changzhi County and Lucheng County, with 14,370 mu of land. This was originally an old revolutionary base area during the Anti-Japanese War, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has a history of nearly ten years; about 87% of the farmers have been organized. Especially because agricultural production cooperatives have been tried out, many farmers have further realized the superiority of collective production and actively demanded the establishment of collective farms. In early July this year, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, after a month of deliberation, 920 peasant households (including 2,490 male and female members and their family members of 4,391) from four villages including Wangcun, Nanchui, Guancun, and Zhuoma in the area voluntarily participated in the collective farm, and handed over their land and its right to use to the farm, and carried out collective labor according to the principle of distribution according to work.

In order to help build the collective farm, the state has specially set up a tractor station with four tractors here. From the beginning of September to mid-October, the farm has completed the sowing plan of 2,320 mu of wheat, and started autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation and other work. At present, all the members are launching a winter production competition with the goal of producing 6 million catties of grain next year. The farm has now selected 42,000 catties of excellent varieties. The four flour mills and one lime kiln in the sideline production have already started production, and one-third of the plan to buy 500 pigs has been completed. In the productive activities full of confidence, all the members, in order to celebrate the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" and the establishment of the farm, respectively sent telegrams to Chairman Mao and Stalin, guaranteeing to advance under the leadership of Chairman Mao on the road taken by Soviet farmers.

    听了访苏代表李顺达等的报告
    山西农民积极学习苏联先进经验
    长治专区老根据地成立“中苏友好集体农庄”
    山西省在“中苏友好月”期间，组织去苏联参观回来的农民代表李顺达、张德胜等六人，分赴各地报告他们的访苏观感。每个代表带着一个电影队，同时给听众放映苏联电影。他们每到一地，都受到群众最热烈的欢迎。从十一月一日到十日，他们在七个县作的十五次报告中，听众达五万八千零四十一人。定襄县河边村原来打算让村干部、党员、宣传员等四十多人前去听讲，但群众听到消息后，有二十多人自动前往参加。
    所有听众对苏联人民的生产和生活情形都非常关心。每次报告完毕，农民就要组织讨论。他们在讨论中提出许多问题，请代表解答。农民们提的问题的范围很广，如：集体农庄是怎样发展起来的？自留地怎样耕种？劳动果实怎样分配？劳动日如何评定？老、弱、残废的人怎样生活？庄员的房子是公有还是私有？苏联农户的剩余生产品怎样出卖？等等。代表们对这些问题都作了详细的解答。
    听了报告以后，群众的觉悟程度进一步提高了。对伟大的社会主义国家——苏联更加热爱了，同时也看到了自己的美好前途。介休县农民出身的党员李文轩说：“从前领导同志说不吃大锅饭，心里总有些怀疑。这回代表们给咱亲眼看到了，咱们的糊涂思想可解决了。”介休四区的农民杨喜泉说：“这次报告真解决了我的问题。我有十二个孩子，从前以为在任何社会里也是人口多了就不会有好生活，谁知道苏联生得孩子多了，还受政府奖励。苏联真是太好了。”山区的农民听到苏联山区人民由于养奶牛、植树、养蚕……得到丰富的收获的情形，都认识了自己的山区发展的前途。灵石县五区劳动模范张文秀、薛辛文说：“现在才真正明白山地也能到达社会主义社会了，一定要努力生产，争取它早些到来。”
    学习苏联先进生产经验，已成为山西农民日益增长的要求。听过报告的干部和农民，对苏联用机器代替艰苦劳动的事实都非常羡慕。定襄县张召村副村长韩玉川说：以前上级让组织起来走苏联的道路，我就不相信互助组能到了集体农庄。现在才知道苏联的集体农庄也是由小而大发展起来的。我一定要好好领导互助组，将来组成集体农庄，就可以使用机器了。永济县刘家涧村中共支部书记说：苏联有防护林带，克服了自然灾害，我一定要向群众好好宣传，响应政府的号召，多多种树，防洪防旱。待阳村中共支部书记韩根虎原以为他的村庄已经压了三千车玉茭秆作肥料，已经差不多了；听了苏联使用肥料的情形的报告，觉得差得太远，决定还要多积肥。稷山县文化馆现在已规定每月七日为
    “学习苏联日”。稷山中学和高小的师生听了报告，向上级提出建议，要求允许他们下乡宣传苏联人民的生活情形和苏联的先进生产经验。
    又讯：山西省长治专区试办的拥有九百二十户农民的集体农庄，经过四个月的积极筹备，已在十一月十六日正式成立。这是目前我国关内农村中规模较大的一个集体农庄。农庄正式成立的大会上，全体庄员一致通过：将这个集体农庄命名为“中苏友好集体农庄”。会上还产生了集体农庄管理委员会并选出农庄主席和委员。参加集体农庄成立大会的除全体庄员外，还有附近农民一千二百多人。
    “中苏友好集体农庄”位于太行山“上党盆地”的中心、长治县和潞城县之间，有土地一万四千三百七十亩。这里原是抗日战争时期的革命老根据地，互助合作运动已有近十年的历史；约有百分之八十七的农户已组织起来。特别因为试办过农业生产合作社，许多农民更进一步体会了集体生产的优越性，积极要求成立集体农庄。今年七月初，在中国共产党和人民政府的帮助下，经过一个月的酝酿，该地的王村、南垂、关村、捉马等四个村的九百二十户农民（包括二千四百九十个男女庄员及其家庭成员四千三百九十一人）便自动参加集体农庄，并将自己的土地和它的使用权交给农庄，以按劳取酬的原则，进行集体劳动。
    为了帮助建设集体农庄，国家在这里专设了一个拥有四部拖拉机的拖拉机站。从九月初开始到十月中旬，农庄已完成了二千三百二十亩小麦的播种计划，并开始秋耕、积肥等工作。目前全体庄员正以明年生产六百万斤粮食为目标，开展冬季生产竞赛。农庄现在已选下优良品种四万二千斤。副业生产的四座粉坊和一座石灰窑已经开工生产，买猪五百口的计划已经完成三分之一。全体庄员在满怀信心的生产活动中，为庆祝“中苏友好月”和农庄的成立，分别致电毛主席和斯大林，保证在毛主席的领导下向着苏联农民所走的道路前进。
