Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: The newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial on the 28th entitled "The Strength of Free People Is Growing and Becoming Stronger," stating that 1952 will be forever remembered as a year in which the united and powerful socialist camp of free people achieved brilliant successes. The editorial stated that under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union, the first "shock brigade" of the world revolution and the workers' movement, is confidently advancing towards communism. With the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union, the working people of the people's democratic countries are enthusiastically building their new lives according to the great example of the Soviet Union.

*Pravda* emphatically pointed out that simply listing the important new enterprises started in the Eastern European people's democratic countries in 1952 convincingly demonstrates the rapid changes in these countries and the great vitality of the new social system. Poland started the construction of two blast furnaces, a large iron smelting plant, several open-hearth furnaces, and a huge hydroelectric power station this year. Czechoslovakia started the construction of two blast furnaces, three open-hearth furnaces, an iron smelting plant, and two hydroelectric power stations this year. Hungary started the construction of a blast furnace and a large textile factory this year. Romania started the construction of two large power stations this year. Bulgaria started the construction of a large pulp factory and completed an important railway line this year. Albania has started construction of many industrial enterprises this year. The above are only part of the construction projects in the people's democratic countries in 1952. Peaceful construction in the German Democratic Republic is proceeding smoothly. The People's Republic of China has exceeded pre-war levels in the production of important industries, land reform has been basically completed, and huge water conservancy projects are currently underway. The speed of industrial development in the people's democratic countries in 1952 was twenty-five times the speed of industrial development in all Marshall Plan countries in Western Europe.

*Pravda* pointed out that the economic development of the people's democratic and socialist camp countries is for the benefit of the working people. This development ensures a systematic improvement in the people's living standards and guarantees full employment. In capitalist countries, however, the purpose of economic development is to maximize profits for capitalists. The people's democratic countries are able to develop so rapidly because they receive the brotherly assistance and support of the Soviet Union in building their new lives. In the post-war period, the free people of the socialist camp have jointly striven to develop their economies and have engaged in economic cooperation and mutual assistance.

*Pravda* pointed out that the achievements of the builders of the new life have aroused the frantic rage of the imperialist reactionary camp, which is trying to obstruct the peaceful construction labor of the free people. However, this attempt is doomed to failure.

The *Pravda* editorial said that as they welcome 1953, the free people of the socialist camp are determined to achieve new victories in the construction of socialist life and in the struggle to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: *Pravda* published an article on the 28th, looking forward to the economic construction work of the people's democratic countries in 1953. The article said that with each passing year, the working people of the united and powerful socialist camp of countries are moving a step closer to a better future. In 1952, the people's democratic countries achieved great successes in peaceful construction. Next year, they will continue to advance steadily along the same road.

In mentioning the peaceful construction plans of the people's democratic countries for next year, *Pravda* wrote that China is about to launch large-scale economic construction. The main purpose of economic construction is national industrialization. Geological and other explorations will be conducted on an unprecedented scale, ten to twenty-three times the scale of 1952. In 1953, more than 800 kilometers of railways will be built, and more than 7,000 kilometers of highways will be constructed.

People's Poland will continue to develop rapidly in the new year. The rolling mill will begin construction at the Nowa Huta metallurgical plant, and the first two coking ovens there will also begin production next year. Two blast furnaces at the Bolesław Bierut Steel Plant will also begin operation.

Czechoslovakia's total industrial output in 1953 will increase by 18.4 percent compared to 1952. Electricity production will increase by about 17 percent. Great attention will be paid to the mining of coal, ferrous metals, and non-ferrous metals.

Romania's industrial output next year will increase by 24 percent compared to this year. Among the newly built factories are a steel plant built in Moldova, as well as aluminum plants, automobile factories, and other industrial enterprises. Hungary pays special attention to the development of the coal mining industry, the metallurgical industry, the petroleum industry, and the production of electricity. The Stalin Steel Plant is about to begin operation, and the construction of huge power stations will continue.

In Bulgaria, the construction of the Lenin National Metallurgical Plant, a soda factory, and other important enterprises will be completed next year. Industrial production will increase by more than 16 percent compared to this year.

People's Albania has formulated an extensive construction plan. The construction of the huge hydroelectric power station on the Mati River, the Selik oil refinery, the cement plant on the Vlorë River, the weaving factory in Tirana, and many other enterprises will continue.

    苏联“真理报”发表评论
    回顾社会主义阵营经济建设成就
    展望人民民主国家明年建设远景
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十八日发表题为“自由人民的力量日益增长壮大”的社论说：一九五二年将以团结一致的强大的社会主义阵营自由人民获得辉煌成就的一年永垂史册。社论说：在列宁和斯大林党的领导下，世界革命和工人阶级运动的第一个“突击队”——苏联正满怀信心地朝着共产主义前进。在苏联兄弟般的援助下，各人民民主国家的劳动人民正按照苏联的伟大榜样热情洋溢地建设他们的新生活。
    真理报着重指出，只需举出东欧人民民主国家在一九五二年新开工的重要企业单位，就令人信服地证明了这些国家的迅速变化和新的社会制度的伟大活力。波兰今年新开工的有鼓风炉两座、生产能力巨大的炼铁厂一座、马丁炉几座、巨大的水电站一座；捷克斯洛伐克今年新开工的有鼓风炉两座、马丁炉三座、炼铁厂一座、水电站两座；匈牙利今年新开工的有鼓风炉一座，巨大的纺织厂一座；罗马尼亚今年新开工的有两个巨大的电力站；保加利亚今年新开工的有一个巨大的纸浆工厂，还修成了一条重要的铁路线；阿尔巴尼亚今年有许多工业企业已经开工。以上这些仅仅是各人民民主国家一九五二年的建设的一部分。德意志民主共和国的和平建设正在顺利进行中。中华人民共和国在重要工业方面的产量已超过战前水平，土地改革基本上已经完成，目前正在进行巨大的水利工程建设。一九五二年人民民主国家工业发展的速度为西欧所有马歇尔化国家工业发展速度的二十五倍。
    真理报指出，人民民主和社会主义阵营国家的经济发展是为了劳动人民的利益。这种发展保证有系统地提高人民的生活水平，并保证充分就业。而在资本主义国家中发展经济的目的则是为了使资本家得到最大的利润。人民民主国家能够如此迅速地发展，是因为它们在新生活的建设中得到苏联兄弟般的援助和支持。在战后时期中，社会主义阵营的自由人民共同为发展经济而努力，并进行了经济上的合作和互助。
    真理报指出，新生活建设者的成就激起了帝国主义反动阵营的疯狂暴跳，他们力图阻挠自由人民的和平建设劳动，然而这种企图注定是要失败的。
    真理报社论说：社会主义阵营的自由人民在迎接一九五三年之际，决心要在建设社会主义生活中，在维护和巩固全世界和平的斗争中获得新的胜利。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十八日发表论文，瞻望一九五三年人民民主国家的经济建设工作。论文说：每过一年，团结一致的强大的社会主义阵营国家的劳动人民就向更美好的未来前进一步。一九五二年，人民民主国家在和平建设方面获得了伟大的成就。明年，它们将沿着同样的道路，继续稳步前进。
    在提到人民民主国家明年的和平建设计划时，真理报写道，中国即将展开大规模的经济建设。经济建设的主要目的是国家工业化。地质及其他方面的勘察将在空前的规模上进行，它的规模将是一九五二年的十倍到二十三倍。在一九五三年，将建筑铁路八百多公里，修建公路七千余公里。
    人民波兰在新的一年中将继续迅速发展。在诺伐·胡塔冶金工厂将开始建筑辗压车间，那里的头两个炼焦炉也将在明年开工生产。波列斯拉夫·贝鲁特钢铁工厂的两个鼓风炉也将开始使用。
    捷克斯洛伐克一九五三年的工业总产量将比一九五二年增加百分之十八点四。电力的生产量将增加百分之十七左右。煤、黑色金属和有色金属的开采将受到极大的注意。
    罗马尼亚明年的工业产量将比今年增加百分之二十四。在新建的工厂中有在摩尔多瓦建筑的一个钢铁厂，还有制铝工厂，汽车制造厂和其他工业企业。匈牙利特别注意采煤业、冶金业和石油工业的发展以及电力的生产。斯大林钢铁工厂即将开工，同时巨大的电力站的建筑工作也将继续进行。
    在保加利亚，列宁国家冶金工厂、一个苏打工厂和其他重要企业的建设将在明年完成。工业生产量将比今年增加百分之十六以上。
    人民阿尔巴尼亚已制订了一个广泛的建设计划。麦蒂河上巨大的水力发电站、塞立克的炼油厂、伏罗河上的水泥厂、地拉那的织布工厂以及其他许多企业的建筑将继续进行。
