Patriotic Production Increase Movement Launched on the Basis of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
-- Excerpts from a Speech at the Northeast Rural Work Conference
Zhao Dezun, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Heilongjiang Province achieved a great victory this year in rural work, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the improvement of agricultural technology. In summary, grain production increased, ideological awareness improved, organizations strengthened, and technology advanced.

During our investigation in the countryside, we sensed a new and vigorous atmosphere in rural work. This new atmosphere is the result of patriotic education, education on the new and old paths, and the new development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is closely linked to mass-based technological improvements and cultivation method reforms. On the basis of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, a movement for agricultural technology improvement was launched, which in turn enriched the content of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, enhanced the patriotic production increase movement, and boosted the confidence of the broad masses. Therefore, this year's patriotic production increase movement was basically implemented throughout the year and popularized in all regions, forming a mass movement.

We should correctly assess our achievements. How were these achievements obtained? Mainly through the implementation of the Central Committee's and the Northeast Bureau's instructions on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and through education on the direction of rural development in the countryside. However, we still have many shortcomings. For example, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is still uneven; some lower-level groups could be improved but have not been; some district and village cadres still have a tendency to blindly create large groups; and some mutual aid groups have not fully implemented the principle of mutual benefit. The experimental agricultural production cooperatives increased grain production, but had many internal problems. We have not had time to conduct in-depth investigations and studies on the new rural situations and organizational problems that have emerged this year. Technological improvements are only a beginning, and their development is also very uneven. We still have 284 villages without production increase plans and that have not participated in the production increase competition movement. There are still about 5% to 10% of weak villages, about 20% of lower-level groups, and about 20% of households facing difficulties. We have not done enough to build a new socialist countryside on the basis of developing production and increasing grain output. Therefore, we must summarize the experiences of our achievements, overcome the shortcomings in our work, and solve existing problems. Any complacency is harmful to our work.

How to Promote the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

What experiences has Heilongjiang Province gained in the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement this year? We feel there are the following points:

(1) Conducting widespread and in-depth education on patriotism, the direction of rural economic development, and the new and old paths is the foundation for consolidating and improving farmers' ideological awareness and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In January of this year, at the provincial labor model conference, we criticized the rich peasant ideology represented by Wang Zhentang (who has now corrected his mistakes), which gave a great education to the province's labor models. Various counties and districts, through various conferences and training courses, used typical examples and criticism methods to vividly conduct education on the new and old paths, which was very effective. Zhaoyuan County, by convening a meeting of Party member representatives and Party training courses in various districts, educated Party members on the new and old paths. Party member awareness was raised, and some Party members with exploitative behavior voluntarily dismissed long-term laborers and canceled usurious loans. This improved the Party's leadership level in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In addition, within the permanent mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, political work systems were established to conduct ideological education, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and establish reading groups and cultural learning. This played a great role in transforming the small peasant's selfish and self-interested habits and improving the political awareness and cultural level of farmers.

(2) According to the seasons, starting with the labor model groups, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, from point to area, from partial to whole, organizing farmers' patriotic competition under leadership played a significant role in promoting and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Many counties and districts vigorously organized farmers to visit typical examples in the field, which also had a great educational effect on farmers. This purposeful and planned organization of visits played a significant role in promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement and improving production increase techniques, achieving great results.

(3) According to the production season, focusing on the central work at the time, grasping the main problems, and concentrating on solving them. During spring plowing, the focus was on adjusting the ratio of manpower and animal power, implementing the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, opposing bringing long-term laborers into the cooperative, and vigorously supporting poor households. During summer weeding, the proposal was to strengthen the work of lower-level groups and weak villages to overcome the uneven progress of summer weeding and create conditions for overall production increase and increased yields per unit area. It was also proposed to improve the crop rotation system within the mutual aid groups to avoid a large number of disbandments during the tense period of weeding. During the slack season after hoeing, we seized the preparations for next year's large-scale production, launched a manure accumulation movement, and strengthened the leadership of the preparatory work for the newly established production cooperatives. During the autumn harvest, we called for fully utilizing the role of mutual aid groups to accelerate the progress of the autumn harvest, emphasizing the close coordination of "cutting," "pulling," and "threshing," advocating the conditional and appropriate linking of groups to meet the needs of large-scale autumn harvest production, and also seizing the work of autumn plowing. Experience has proven that the past phenomenon of some mutual aid groups "tight in spring planting, loose in summer weeding, and collapsing in autumn harvest" was only the result of the leadership being "tight in spring, relaxed in summer, and letting go in autumn." As long as the leadership grasps tightly, the problems in the mutual aid and cooperation movement can be gradually solved throughout the year's production process.

(4) Timely summarize the experience in production technology and production management, train backbones and activists, consolidate and improve the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This year, we adopted the method of "clear division of labor, training at all levels." Through various forms such as labor model meetings, technical research conferences, and mutual aid group leader meetings, we first organized the activists and backbone members in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and regularly trained them. On the one hand, short-term training was conducted every season to summarize production experience, conduct education, and improve their agricultural technical level and production management ability. On the other hand, specific problems within cooperatives and mutual aid groups were inspected and resolved, and policy education on the three major principles of voluntariness, democracy, and mutual benefit was conducted to improve the policy level of rural work cadres.

(5) The experience of experimentally running agricultural production cooperatives is: We must resolutely implement the guidelines instructed by the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, and experimentally run them step by step with leadership, focus, and conditions. This can avoid spontaneity and blindness. Doing so is correct. Experience has proven that the impetuous mood of greed for more and rash advance, and the practice of letting go and not providing leadership, are both wrong, and must be strictly prevented during the stage of experimentally running cooperatives and in the process of cooperativization. After the cooperatives are established, consolidation and improvement is the main issue. Constantly improving operation and management and improving production efficiency is the central link of consolidation work; and to do a good job in production management, it is necessary to strictly organize labor, strengthen the planning of production, strengthen labor discipline, establish and implement a production responsibility system, and constantly fight against bad tendencies such as absenteeism, idling, wasting public property, and no one being responsible. A reasonable distribution system can greatly promote production, it is the decisive condition for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, and it is necessary to implement the principle of "distribution according to work," calculating work points and distributing bonuses, and adhering to the policy of gradually accumulating public property from less to more, ensuring that members have more actual income. This year's experience has proven that the method of distributing dividends on livestock and agricultural implements as shares and prematurely pricing livestock and agricultural implements as belonging to the cooperative is inappropriate, and the rental form is the most suitable. Correct national assistance is necessary, but it is necessary to avoid the phenomenon of members being too heavily in debt and affecting their actual income. It is necessary to implement a strict financial system and a system of democratic management by members, and oppose patriarchal leadership.

In the future, we must continue to grasp these points: further deepen the education of the new and old two roads; conscientiously summarize this year's experience in mutual aid and cooperation movement and production increase, educate all cadres and the masses; agricultural production cooperatives should seize the autumn to do a good job in distribution; mutual aid groups should start to rectify the organization in winter and make production plans for next year; actively develop rural credit work with leadership and conditions, focus on experimental credit cooperatives, actively develop credit departments, and universally promote the establishment of credit groups; strengthen the work of weak villages, lower-level groups, and small towns; adhere to typical demonstrations, cultivate and improve typical examples, combine points and areas, and combine creation and promotion.

How to Promote Agricultural Production Increase Technology

In terms of agricultural technology, Zhaoyuan County's production increase experience has universal significance for our entire province.

1. After inspection, the Provincial Party Committee affirmed Zhaoyuan's experience. Their formulation of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, preserving seedlings, and topdressing in stages" is also correct. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also believes that Zhaoyuan's experience is still a preliminary experience of technological reform. When promoting Zhaoyuan's experience, we cannot be satisfied with the current level.

2. Regarding Zhaoyuan's production increase experience, we organized a technical inspection, which found that the highest yield was achieved with a millet ridge width of 1.8 feet and a sowing width of 3 to 4 inches. A plant spacing of 1.5 inches is more appropriate. The wide sowing of sorghum, beans, and corn is to plant two rows on one ridge, with the seedlings spaced in a "dog bite pattern." The main method for planting wheat is to use new agricultural tools for flat sowing; if new agricultural tools are not available, the method of increasing rows with large and small ridges can be used. The sowing width and plant spacing need to be determined according to the quality of the land and the amount of manure. It is necessary to conduct specific investigations and avoid mechanical copying.

3. Promoting the experience of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, preserving seedlings, and topdressing in stages" is inseparable from improving the comprehensive technology of seed treatment, land preparation, sowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest. For example, to promote this experience, it is not enough to apply manure once every three years, but at a minimum, manure should be applied once every two years. The old methods of sowing and weeding must also be changed, and it is best to use new agricultural tools, which is directly related to increasing animal power. In addition, some areas must also pay attention to wind prevention, drought prevention, tree planting, and water conservancy, otherwise it will not be possible to increase production further. Therefore, this experience should be used as a preliminary foundation for changing the extensive farming methods in Heilongjiang Province, and gradually combined with comprehensive technology, thereby guiding agricultural technology to a higher level.

4. Finally, there is another issue, that is, our Party and government must take on the responsibility of leading agricultural technology, establishing technical promotion organizations, and rationally promoting agricultural technology movements on the basis of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

Technical leadership is an urgent requirement of the vast majority of farmers, but some of our rural Party and government leaders are still stuck in general appeals, and cannot keep up with the actual needs of the masses. They can only call on the masses to produce more grain, but cannot actually guide how to "produce more grain." Therefore, some farmers are resistant to our calls. On the other hand, although some labor models and activists can actively respond to the government's call, they have produced many deviations due to our lack of specific technical guidance.

Some agricultural technicians still have serious work styles of being detached from the masses and detached from reality, so their technology conflicts with the practical experience of farmers. For example, teachers at the Heilongjiang Agricultural College used to tell students: "The frost-free period in Heilongjiang is short, so millet cannot be thinned and corn can only produce one ear." In view of this situation, ideological transformation should be carried out on technical personnel to make them truly agricultural experts of the people.

In terms of technical leadership, attention should be paid to grasping new problems and the policy issues raised. For example, a large-scale production increase movement can only achieve greater success on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation. However, there are contradictions between individual interests and collective interests within the mutual aid group. Everyone is willing to engage in production increase on their own land, but is not willing to engage in production increase on other people's land. Therefore, a reasonable management and distribution system that benefits everyone should be stipulated. The same is true for seed selection, and the land owner of the seed selection field must be given reasonable compensation.

    在互助合作运动基础上开展起来的爱国丰产运动
    ——在东北农村工作会议上的发言摘要
    中共黑龙江省委书记  赵德尊
    黑龙江省今年在农村工作、互助合作运动和提高农业技术方面打了一个很大的胜仗。总起来说，就是粮食多打了，思想进步了，组织提高了，技术改进了。
    我们下乡调查，觉得农村工作有了一种蓬勃发展的新气象。这种新气象是爱国主义教育、新旧道路教育和互助合作运动新发展的结果。而互助合作运动的发展又是和群众性的技术改良，耕作法的改革紧密相结合的。在互助合作运动基础上，开展了农业技术改良运动，而技术改良运动又反过来丰富了互助合作运动的内容，提高了爱国主义丰产运动，并鼓舞了广大群众的信心。因此，今年的爱国丰产运动，基本上贯彻全年，普及各地，形成了群众运动。
    我们应当正确地估计我们的成绩。这些成绩是怎样得来的呢？主要是贯彻了中央和东北局关于农业生产互助合作的指示，并在农村中进行了农村发展方向的教育。但是，我们还有很多不够的地方。比如互助合作运动的发展还不平衡；还有部分低级组可以提高而没有提高，有些区村干部还有盲目搞大组的倾向，一部分互助组贯彻两利的原则还不够。今年试办农业生产合作社，粮食是多打了，但内部问题很多；今年农村的新情况与组织起来的新问题，还没有来得及深入调查研究。技术改良仅是开始，而且发展也很不平衡；我们还有二百八十四个村没有增产计划，没有参加丰产竞赛运动；还有百分之五到十的薄弱村，百分之二十的低级组，百分之二十左右的困难户；我们在发展生产多打粮食的基础上，建设新农村做得还不够。因此，我们必须总结取得成绩的经验，克服工作中的缺点，解决存在的问题，任何自满情绪都是对工作有害的。
    怎样推进互助合作运动
    今年黑龙江省的农村互助合作运动取得哪些经验呢？我们感到有以下几点：
    （一）广泛深入地进行爱国主义和农村经济发展方向、新旧两条道路的教育，是巩固和提高农民思想觉悟和互助合作运动的基础。今年一月，我们在省劳动模范会上，批判了以王振堂为代表的富农思想（他现已改正），给全省劳动模范以很大的教育；各个县区通过各种会议与训练班的形式，采取典型实例批判的方法，生动地进行新旧两条道路的教育，收效很大。肇源县通过召开党员代表大会与各区办党训班的方式，对党员进行新旧两条道路的教育，党员觉悟提高了，一部分有剥削行为的党员自动解雇了长工，取消了高利贷。这样就提高了党领导互助合作运动的水平。另外，在常年互助组与生产合作社内部，开始建立了政治工作制度，进行思想教育，开展批评与自我批评，建立读报组与文化学习。这对改造小农自私自利的习性，提高农民的政治觉悟与文化水平起了很大作用。
    （二）按照季节，由劳动模范组开始，自上而下，自下而上，由点到面，由部分到全体，组织农民爱国竞赛的领导方法，对推动与发展互助合作运动起了很大的作用。很多县、区大力组织农民实地参观典型，对农民的教育作用也很大。这种有目的、有计划地组织参观，对推动互助合作运动和提高丰产技术起了很大作用，收到很大效果。
    （三）按生产季节，结合当时的中心工作，抓紧主要问题，集中加以解决。在春耕中，着重调整人马工比价，贯彻等价两利原则，反对带长工入社，大力扶助贫困户。在夏锄中提出加强低级组和薄弱村的工作，以克服夏锄进展不平衡的现象，为全面增产、提高单位面积产量创造了条件；又提出改进互助组内的轮作制度，避免铲趟紧张时期大量散伙的现象。在挂锄期间，我们抓紧了明年大生产的准备工作，掀起了积肥运动，加强了对新建立的生产合作社的准备工作的领导。秋收时，我们号召充分发挥互助组的作用，加速秋收进度，强调“割”
    “拉”“打”紧密配合，提倡有条件地、适当地联组，以适应秋收大生产的需要，同时还抓紧了秋翻地的工作。经验证明，过去某些互助组“春插夏散秋垮台”，只是领导上“春紧夏松秋撒手”的结果。只要领导上抓紧，互助合作运动中的问题，是可以在全年各季生产过程中逐步解决的。
    （四）及时总结生产技术和生产管理方面的经验，培养骨干和积极分子，巩固提高互助合作运动。今年我们采取“明确分工，层层培养”方法，通过劳动模范会、技术研究会、互助组长会等各种形式，首先把互助合作运动中的积极分子和骨干分子组织起来，经常培养他们。一方面，每季进行短期训练，总结生产经验，进行教育，提高他们的农业技术水平和管理生产的能力；另一方面，检查和解决合作社、互助组内部具体问题，进行自愿、民主、互利三大原则的政策教育，提高农村工作干部的政策水平。
    （五）试办农业生产合作社的经验是：必须坚决贯彻中央、东北局所指示的方针，有领导、有重点、有条件地逐级试办。这样可以避免自发性和盲目性。这样做是正确的。经验证明，贪多冒进的急躁情绪和放任自流不加领导的做法都是错误的，在试办合作社的阶段以及合作化过程中都必须严格防止。合作社建立起来之后，巩固提高是主要问题。不断改善经营管理，提高生产效率，是巩固工作的中心一环；而要搞好生产管理，必须严密劳动组织，加强生产的计划性，加强劳动纪律，建立与贯彻生产责任制，不断向旷工、窝工、浪费公共财产和无人负责等不良倾向进行斗争。合理的分配制度可以极大地促进生产，它是巩固农业生产合作社的决定条件，必须贯彻“按劳取酬”计工分红和坚持由少到多逐步积累公共财产的方针，保证社员有更多的实际收入。今年经验证明，牲畜、农具入股分红和过早地把牲畜、农具作价归社的办法都是不妥当的，而以租借形式最为适宜。国家的正确扶助是必要的，但必须避免社员负债过重、影响社员实际收入的现象。必须贯彻严格的财务制度和依靠社员民主管理的制度，反对家长式的领导。
    今后要继续抓住这几点：进一步深入新旧两条道路的教育；认真总结今年互助合作运动的经验和丰产经验，教育全体干部和群众；农业生产合作社秋季应抓紧做好分配工作；互助组在冬季就开始整顿组织，并做出明年的生产计划；有领导、有条件地积极展开农村信贷工作，有重点地试办信贷合作社，积极发展信用部，普遍提倡建立信用小组；加强薄弱村、低级组、小城镇的工作；坚持典型示范，培养与提高典型，把点和面结合起来，把创造与推广结合起来。
    怎样推广农业增产技术
    在农业技术方面，肇源县的丰产经验，对我们全省来说是有普遍意义的。
    一、省委经过检查，肯定了肇源的经验。他们“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥”的提法也是正确的。同时，省委也认为肇源的经验，还是初步的技术改革的经验。在推广肇源经验时，不能满足于现有水平。
    二、对于肇源的增产经验，我们组织了技术检查，认为谷子一尺八寸的垅宽，三寸到四寸的播幅，产量为最高。株距以一寸五较为合适。高粱、豆子、苞米的宽播，就是一垅种两行，苗间用“狗咬纹”形式。种小麦主要使用新农具，进行平播；没有新农具，可用大小垅增行的办法。播幅和株距，需要根据地的质量、粪肥多少来决定。要具体做好调查，不可机械搬用。
    三、推广“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥”的经验，和改善种籽处理、整地、播种、夏锄、秋收的综合技术分不开。如推广这个经验，三年上一楂粪就不行了，最低限度要二年一楂粪；播种、铲趟的旧式方法也要改变，最好使用新农具，这和增加畜力有直接的关联。另外，有些地区还一定要注意防风、防旱、植树、水利等问题，否则就不能更多增产。因此，要把这个经验做为改变黑龙江省粗放耕作法的初步基础，逐步地和综合技术相结合，从而引导农业技术走向更高的水平。
    四、最后还有一个问题，就是我们党和政府要在互助合作运动的基础上，担当起领导农业技术、建立技术推广组织和合理推广农业技术运动的责任。
    技术领导是目前绝大多数农民迫切的要求，但我们有些农村党政领导干部，还停留在一般号召上，跟不上群众的实际需要，他们只能号召群众多打粮食，不能实际指导如何“多打粮食”。因此，部分农民对我们的号召表示抵抗。另一方面，一部分劳动模范、积极分子，虽然能积极地响应政府号召，但由于我们缺乏具体技术指导，产生了很多偏向。
    某些农业技术人员还有严重的脱离群众、脱离实际的工作作风，因而他们的技术与农民的实际经验相抵触。如黑龙江农业专科学校的教师在过去教导学生时说：“黑龙江地区无霜期短，所以谷子不能间苗，苞米只能结一穗。”鉴于这种情形，对技术人员应进行思想改造，使其成为名符其实的人民的农业专家。
    在技术领导方面，要注意掌握新问题和所提出来的政策问题。如大面积丰产运动，必须在互助合作的基础上，才能获得更大的成绩。但是在互助组内部又存在着个人利益与集体利益的矛盾，大家愿意在自己的土地上搞丰产，而不愿意在别人土地上搞丰产。因此，应规定合理的对大家都有利的管理和分配的制度。选种也是这样，必须给选种田的土地所有者以合理的代价。
