    Japanese Electrical and Coal Mining Workers Persist in Strike Struggle
    Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party Calls on the People to Support Striking Workers
    All-China Coal Miners' Union Expresses Support for Japanese Coal Miners
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The 120,000 electrical industry workers who have been on strike for over two months began another 40-hour strike from 8:00 AM on the 2nd, marking their twelfth strike since September 24th. After this strike ended at midnight on the 3rd, a 72-hour power outage strike immediately commenced. The main target of this power outage was several hundred large factories, while residential electricity supply remained normal. The All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union also ordered its affiliated unions to implement their fourteenth power outage strike starting on the 7th. The indefinite strike of coal miners, which began on October 17th, is also continuing.

    The struggle of private transportation workers for year-end bonuses is also ongoing. On the 3rd, thirty unions belonging to the All-Japan Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions announced a strike, involving more than 35,000 participants. The strike paralyzed electric train and bus transportation in nine prefectures in the Kansai region of Japan. Meanwhile, representatives of the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, who were negotiating with the authorities for wage increases, staged a sit-down strike in Tokyo on the 1st after the authorities refused to accept the workers' demands.

    Japanese monopoly capital groups have consistently refused the workers' demands for wage increases, attempting to force workers back to work through starvation during the prolonged stalemate. However, this scheme is doomed to fail. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) has called on union members to donate cash and food to support the electrical industry workers and coal miners. Women's groups in coal mining areas such as Fukuoka, Omuta, and Tagawa have successively resolved to take care of family life, supporting the strike struggle of their fathers and brothers. Government employees, who have been deprived of their right to strike, have also launched a struggle demanding wage increases and the issuance of year-end bonuses. The Japan Council of Government Employees' Unions decided to order its 1.6 million members to leave work early and refuse overtime from the 1st to the 5th. The union authorities have also instructed members to prepare for multiple struggles thereafter.

    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 10th] Tokyo dispatch: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on November 19th, calling on Japanese Communist Party members, the entire working class, and the people of the entire nation to vigorously donate funds to support the strike struggle of coal miners and electrical industry workers.

    The statement said: The workers of the coal miners' union and the electrical industry workers' union are standing at the forefront of the national people's struggle for a stable life, independence, and peace. Because the coal miners, the electrical industry workers, and their families understand this, they are gritting their teeth and persisting in the struggle. The workers of the coal miners' union and their families have not received a penny of wages for a month. If we can provide assistance to the coal miners and the electrical industry workers now, the victory of this strike will undoubtedly be guaranteed, and the people's struggle to defend peace will undoubtedly have enormous development.

    The statement called on all Japanese Communist Party members to immediately donate funds to support the coal miners and electrical industry workers and their families, and also called on all party members to dedicate themselves to the glorious and great cause of strongly uniting the people of the entire nation with love and trust. At the same time, the statement called on all Japanese workers and the people of the entire nation to work hard to donate funds, encourage and support the coal miners and the electrical industry workers who are struggling for peace and independence; and also requested mass organizations to participate in this movement.

    According to Xinhua News Agency: Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China, sent a telegram to the Japanese Coal Miners' Union on the 6th, representing the Chinese coal miners, expressing support for the strike struggle of the Japanese coal miners. The telegram said: "The Chinese coal miners express their highest respect for the spirit of unity and the fearless heroism you have demonstrated in the struggle, and express our boundless indignation at the conspiracies and tricks of the US-Japanese monopoly capitalists to undermine and suppress the strike." The telegram concluded: "I once again represent all Chinese coal miners in expressing our full support to you and wish you a final victory in your united strike struggle."

    日本电气和煤矿等产业工人坚持罢工斗争
    日共中央指导部号召人民支持罢工工人
    我国煤矿工会全国委员会声援日本煤矿工人
    据新华社讯：已经坚持了两个多月罢工斗争的十二万名电气产业工人，从二日上午八时起又开始举行四十小时的罢工，这是从九月二十四日以来的第十二次罢工。这次罢工在三日午夜结束后，接着又开始举行七十二小时的停电罢工。这次停电的主要对象是数百家大工厂，对家庭的用电仍照常输送。全日本电气产业工会同时命令所属各工会，从七日起实行第十四次停电罢工。从十月十七日开始的煤矿工人的无一定限期的罢工，也在坚持进行着。
    私营运输业工人要求年终津贴的斗争也在继续进行。三日，属于日本私营铁路工会总联合会的三十个工会宣布罢工，参加这一罢工的有三万五千多人。罢工使日本关西地方九个县的电气火车和公共汽车的交通陷入瘫痪状态。同时，为提高工资与当局进行谈判的日本国营铁道工会的代表，由于当局拒绝接受工人的要求，于一日在东京举行了静坐罢工。
    日本垄断资本集团一直拒绝工人关于增加工资的要求，企图在拖延的过程中利用饥饿迫使工人复工。但是，这种阴谋是不能得逞的。日本工会总评议会已经号召工会会员捐募现金和粮食，支援电气产业工人和煤矿工人。福冈、大牟田、田川等煤矿的妇女团体，纷纷决议负责照顾家庭生活，支持会员们的父亲和兄弟的罢工斗争。被剥夺了罢工权利的政府机关工作人员，也展开了要求增加工资和发给年终津贴的斗争。日本官厅工会协议会决定命令它的一百六十万会员从一日起到五日止，提前下班并拒绝加班。工会当局并指示会员在此以后再准备进行多次的斗争。
    【新华社十日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部曾在十一月十九日发表文告，号召日本共产党党员、全体工人阶级和全国人民大力捐助款项，支援煤矿工人和电气产业工人的罢工斗争。
    文告说：煤矿工会和电气产业工会的工人们是站在争取生活安定、独立与和平的全国人民的前列进行斗争的。由于煤矿工人和电气产业工人以及他们的家属懂得这一点，因此才咬紧牙关坚持斗争。煤矿工会的工人及其家属一个月以来没有领到一文工资。如果现在我们能给煤矿工人和电气产业工人以援助，那末，这个罢工的胜利无疑地会得到保证，人民保卫和平的斗争无疑地也会有巨大的发展。
    文告号召全体日本共产党员立即捐款支援煤矿工人和电气产业工人及其家属，并要求全体党员献身于用友爱和信任来坚强地团结全国人民的光荣的伟大事业。文告同时号召日本全体工人和全国人民努力捐献款项，鼓励和支援正在为和平与独立而斗争的煤矿工人和电气产业工人；并要求群众团体也参加到这个运动中来。
    据新华社讯：中国煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫于六日致电日本煤矿工会，代表中国煤矿工人，对日本煤矿工人的罢工斗争表示支援。电文说：“中国煤矿工人对于你们在斗争中所表现的团结精神和大无畏的英勇气概，表示崇高的敬意，并对美日垄断资本家企图破坏和镇压罢工的阴谋诡计，表示无比的愤恨。”电文最后说：“我再次代表全中国的煤矿工人，向你们表示全力的支援，并祝你们在团结一致的罢工斗争中，获得最后的胜利。”
