Our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Enlai, telegraphed a reply on December 14th to Mr. Pearson, Chairman of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Regarding the resolution passed brazenly by the UN General Assembly, under circumstances where it refused to allow the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend, supporting the U.S. government's violation of international conventions and forced detention of prisoners of war to benefit its continued and expanded war of aggression in Korea, he deemed it illegal and invalid, and expressed firm opposition. At the same time, Foreign Minister Zhou proposed that the UN General Assembly should rescind this illegal resolution and instruct the U.S. government to immediately resume the Korean armistice negotiations and, in accordance with the draft Korean Armistice Agreement, first implement a comprehensive ceasefire, and then hand over the issue of the total repatriation of prisoners of war to the "Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question" as proposed by the Soviet Union on November 10th and November 24th. This statement by Foreign Minister Zhou is a concentrated expression of the just demands of the Chinese people. The entire Chinese people express unanimous and full support for this.

As early as February 1951, the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, under U.S. command, forcibly passed a shameless and slanderous resolution hostile to the Chinese people, wantonly accusing the People's Republic of China of being an "aggressor." Now, the Seventh Session of the UN General Assembly has once again disregarded the fair and reasonable proposals of the Korean and Chinese people, undermined the solemn principles of international conventions, and violated the ardent desire of peace-loving people worldwide for the restoration of peace in Korea, by passing the above-mentioned shameful and illegal resolution to support the U.S.'s so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation," which is in reality the forced detention of prisoners of war. It uses this to open the door wide for the U.S.'s conspiracy to prolong and expand its war of aggression in Korea. This clearly shows that the United Nations is further transforming itself into a tool of the U.S.'s aggressive policies. Peace-loving people all over the world cannot tolerate this.

The illegal resolution passed by the UN General Assembly based on the Indian proposal pays lip service to the idea that the release and repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 1949, the established principles and practices of international law, and the relevant provisions of the draft armistice agreement. However, the same illegal resolution immediately follows by stating that force should not be used against prisoners of war to compel them to return to their homelands. The implementation of this latter provision, in essence, cancels the principle of total repatriation of prisoners of war, which is consistently affirmed in the relevant articles of the Geneva Convention, international practice, and the draft armistice agreement.

No matter how this illegal resolution and Mr. Pearson's telegram of December 5th manipulate the terms of the Geneva Convention, the principle of unconditional and total repatriation of all prisoners of war, as stipulated in all relevant international conventions on prisoners of war, is clearly and distinctly opposed to the U.S. proposal, supported by the UN's illegal resolution, of forcibly detaining prisoners of war after the armistice.

The principle of unconditional and total repatriation of prisoners of war was already stipulated in Article 20 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land attached to the Convention with respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land of the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899. Article 20 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land attached to the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907 was reiterated. It was perfected, clearly and definitely, through the provisions of Article 75 of the Geneva Convention of 1929, and ultimately became Articles 118 and 119 of the Geneva Convention of 1949. Article 118 states: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." In order to prevent the detaining power from using any pretext to violate this principle or delay repatriation, the article further stipulates: "In the absence of stipulations to the above effect in any agreement concluded between the Parties to the conflict with a view to the cessation of hostilities, or failing any such agreement, each detaining power shall itself establish and execute without delay a plan of repatriation in conformity with the principle laid down in the foregoing paragraph." Article 119 of the same Convention, after affirming the various principles of the preceding article, further strictly points out: "Committees shall be set up by agreement between the Parties to the conflict, to search for dispersed prisoners of war and to ensure their prompt repatriation."

In the Korean armistice negotiations, the draft armistice agreement agreed upon by both parties made the same provisions for the release and repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides, based on the above-mentioned internationally recognized principles of international conventions and international practice. Article 51 of the draft states: "All prisoners of war held in custody by each side at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as possible. Such release and repatriation of prisoners of war shall be effected in accordance with the lists exchanged and corrected by both sides prior to the signing of this Armistice Agreement."

What similarity is there between the principles of the above-mentioned international conventions, international practice, and the draft armistice agreement and the UN's illegal resolution's so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return to their homelands"? None, absolutely none. On the contrary, according to the provisions of Article 7 of the Geneva Convention, the so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return to their homelands" has absolutely no basis. This article states: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such exist." This point was discussed in detail at the 1949 Geneva International Conference. At that conference, a special committee discussed a proposal: "Prisoners of war shall in no circumstances be compelled or induced by other methods of coercion to renounce in part or in entirety their inalienable rights secured to them by this Convention...." The special committee rejected this proposal on the grounds that: first, the rights that cannot be renounced should not be limited to "inalienable" rights, but all rights; second, the prohibited acts of renunciation should not be limited to those due to "compulsion or induced by other methods of coercion," but all acts of renunciation. From this, it can be seen that the Geneva Convention did not fail to consider that the adverse situation of so-called "prisoners of war unwilling to return home" would be created, thus generating the pretext of so-called "voluntary renunciation." And, precisely because it considered that such so-called "voluntary renunciation" is "forced renunciation," that is, "non-forcible repatriation," it made the provisions of Article 7 to eliminate any pretext of so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return home." Does this not clearly indicate that the Geneva Convention not only disapproves of the so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return home," which is in reality the detention of prisoners of war, but also opposes having such an assumption to prevent the detaining power from using it as a pretext to carry out forced detention?

In fact, the so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return home" and the U.S.'s "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" are exactly the same thing. This has been fully confirmed by news reports and official statements from both within and outside the United Nations, including Mr. Pearson's own remarks. And the fact that the so-called "voluntary repatriation," etc., bears no resemblance to the principle of total repatriation of international conventions has even been constantly acknowledged by some in the U.S. and Britain. According to a December 1st dispatch from the British Information Service in London, the Manchester Guardian stated: "A strict study of the Geneva Convention reveals that the United Nations' position on the repatriation of prisoners of war is indeed in conflict with the convention." Even Mrs. Roosevelt of the United States, because the so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" violates international conventions, publicly advocated in the New York World-Telegram and the Sun: The United States should not adhere too closely to various international conventions.

From here, can we not draw the conclusion that the so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return home" is something incompatible with the principle of total repatriation of the Geneva Convention? Could the UN General Assembly be blind to this point? Knowing this and insisting that it is not so is clearly playing tricks, hoping to put the hat of the Geneva Convention on the head of the U.S.'s so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation," which is in reality the principle of forced detention of prisoners of war. On the one hand, it is used to deceive the world, so that the U.S.'s poisonous scheme of forcibly detaining prisoners of war after the armistice can be realized. On the other hand, it attempts to mix the U.S.'s so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" with the Geneva Convention, thereby blurring the principle of unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war as clearly stipulated by the Geneva Convention. This cunning attempt fully demonstrates that the UN General Assembly knows that the U.S.'s unreasonable demands are shameful and cannot be stated openly, but it insists on using perverted laws and fallacies to serve the U.S.'s intentions. If the Korean and Chinese people allow this proposition, which deceives the people and violates international conventions, to be implemented, then what justice can exist in today's international relations, and what standards can be followed? For this reason, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly declared: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China firmly abides by and safeguards the fundamental principle of the Geneva Convention of repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice takes effect, and will continue to firmly abide by and safeguard this principle." This is precisely the unanimous position of the entire Chinese people.

The UN's illegal resolution and Mr. Pearson's telegram are full of international conventions, but in reality, they are based on the so-called "prisoners of war unwilling to return home" pretext created by the U.S. using its policy of slaughtering prisoners of war, to advocate the so-called "not using force to compel prisoners of war to return home," which is in reality the U.S.'s "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation." What a brutal act that violates humanitarianism and disregards facts!

The fact is that, in order to detain prisoners of war so as to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations into which it was forced, the United States had already formulated a policy of detaining prisoners even before the negotiations began.

According to a report in the U.S. Saturday Evening Post on November 1, 1952, as early as July 5, 1951, about five days before the start of the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. National Security Council, organized by the U.S. President and Secretary of State, had already formulated the so-called "voluntary repatriation" policy based on the recommendations of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Army Psychological Warfare Division. At the same time, the U.S. military immediately took action in the prisoner of war camps to create incidents of so-called "Korean and Chinese prisoners of war unwilling to be repatriated" as a pretext for the forced detention of prisoners of war.

The above-mentioned Saturday Evening Post stated: "At the time negotiations started in July 1951, at least a dozen American and United Nations agencies were at work among the prisoners, nominally under the supervision of Eighth Army. Intelligence agencies routinely questioned prisoners, psychological warfare and propaganda agencies conducted almost continuous surveys, and the army’s Civil Information and Education Section mapped out elaborate educational courses."

This kind of questioning, investigation, and "education" gradually formally appeared under the name of so-called "screening," which was jointly carried out by special agents from the U.S., Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek.

In this way, the captured personnel from Korea and China began to encounter the enormous disaster that prisoners of war had never encountered before. The United States used troops and machine guns to force prisoners of war to undergo illegal screening, and forced them to tattoo insults and treasonous words on their bodies, and forced them to make blood fingerprints on blood letters betraying their motherland. Those who refused were shot dead or injured on the spot, or beaten into a coma, and then the special agents tattooed words on their bodies. Some prisoners of war later used knives to cut off a piece of flesh that had been tattooed, and the U.S. special agents would beat them severely and then send them to the so-called "hard labor camp," Camp 71. According to the confession of Wang Jiadi, a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang air-dropped by the United States, the so-called "petition of prisoners of war unwilling to return home" was written by Zhang Xingdeng, a "county magistrate" sent by Chiang Kai-shek, and without letting the prisoners of war see it, they were forced to sign their names and make blood fingerprints on blank paper, and then these signed papers were attached to the petition and handed over to the U.S. military. Sometimes, because the U.S. military ordered urgency, the special agents themselves would put fingerprints on blank paper and sign the names of the prisoners of war as the basis for "prisoners of war unwilling to return home." After the prisoners of war were forced to tattoo and make blood fingerprints, the U.S. aggressors further took pictures of them as a basis for threats, and on the spot coerced the prisoners of war, saying: "Once you are tattooed, you can't go back anymore. Even if you are not anti-communist, we will make you anti-communist."

Despite the fact that the U.S. bandits so brutally and shamelessly forced prisoners of war to express disloyalty to their motherland, the captured personnel from Korea and China carried out heroic resistance to the death. In order to deal with this resistance, the U.S. aggressors even dispatched several divisions of troops, including airborne troops, and used tanks, poison gas, flamethrowers, grenades, and other combat weapons to attack unarmed prisoners of war and carry out massacres. In the past year, according to the U.S. official publications and the reports of the International Committee of the Red Cross alone, more than 3,000 captured personnel from Korea and China have been killed or injured by the U.S. aggressors for refusing to express the so-called "desire not to return home." These are, of course, extremely incomplete figures. For example, the slaughter figures for 1951 were only obtained in 1952. It can be seen that it is not known how many more murder figures have been concealed by the U.S. side. All of this has not only been proven by news reports from the U.S., Britain, France, and other countries, but even the U.S. officials Coursen, Dodd, and others, and the International Committee of the Red Cross have also frankly admitted it.

All of the above fully proves that the so-called "desire of prisoners of war not to return home" of the U.S. aggressors is all created by the U.S. side with bayonets for the purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and that many of the so-called tattoos, signatures, and fingerprints are completely fabricated by the U.S. side. The U.S. side uses what they deliberately manufacture as a basis for framing others, on the one hand, to coerce prisoners of war and not allow them to return home; on the other hand, they use this as a pretext to unreasonably demand the so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" from the Korean and Chinese sides. The UN General Assembly not only does not condemn such criminal behavior of ordinary criminals committed by the United States in international relations, but also uses these criminal acts as a basis to support the U.S.'s so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation." Can this still be considered an international organization with right and wrong and fairness? As Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out: "Fair-minded people all over the world cannot but be surprised and indignant at such a degenerate act by the UN General Assembly."

Based on such a sinful and hypocritical thing, the UN's illegal resolution proposed the so-called method of handing over prisoners of war to a neutral nation repatriation commission. Such a method is, of course, impossible to solve the problem of the total repatriation of prisoners of war. The Christian Bible says that good trees bear good fruit, and bad trees can only bear bad fruit. Since the American criminal actions are taken as the basis, and it is recognized that the prisoners of war have the so-called "desire not to return home," this illegal resolution further stipulates that the prisoners of war who have this so-called "desire" should be handed over to the United Nations 120 days after the armistice takes effect, and they are not allowed to return home. This is truly what Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out: a suggestion that is absurd to the extreme. Have the representatives of the various countries in the United Nations who proposed and passed this illegal resolution forgotten that the United Nations is one of the warring parties in the Korean War? Now, the prisoners of war that the United States wants to detain are handed over to the United Nations. Wouldn't the result be exactly the same as handing them over to the United States? Under such a trap, wouldn't the so-called handing over of prisoners of war to the neutral nation repatriation commission for management and interviews be completely to cover up the U.S.'s forced detention of prisoners of war?

If Mr. Menon, the proposer of the UN illegal resolution, and representatives of many other countries do not deliberately ignore the facts, they will admit that the so-called prisoners of war's "desire not to return home" is something manufactured by the U.S. side and does not actually exist. Then, the problem of total repatriation of prisoners of war only needs to be resolved by handing over the prisoners of war to the other party for interviews, and only this method can solve it. Because the prisoners of war have been tattooed with treasonous words and made blood fingerprints by the U.S. side, and have been photographed, and are constantly being subjected to various coercions by the three kinds of special agents from the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang, and are carrying a great burden on their minds. If they are not handed over to their own people, the special agents who come with them will inevitably continue to coerce them, so that they still cannot return home. Therefore, only by handing them over to their own people can the special agents be afraid to come along, or even if they come along, they can be easily distinguished from the prisoners of war and cannot play a role. In this way, the coercion suffered by the prisoners of war is first lifted, and they can be smoothly interviewed and classified according to nationality and region, and finally they can be safely and totally repatriated home according to the classification. The commanders of the Korean People's Army, Kim Il-sung, and the commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Peng Dehuai, proposed in their letter to Clark on October 16th a fair and reasonable method that can solve the problem.

Some countries in the United Nations know that the methods of Generals Kim and Peng are fair and reasonable and can solve the problem; at the same time, they also know that Soviet Foreign Minister Vishinsky's proposal of November 24th, which advocates a ceasefire first, can immediately realize a ceasefire in Korea. However, they insist on following the United States, and they think that as long as they accommodate the United States and repeat the appeasement policy before World War II, they can achieve a ceasefire and achieve peace. However, they do not know that the U.S. imperialist aggressors are the most greedy and ambitious aggressors in human history. The desire of their monopoly capital to pursue huge profits is unlimited. For the sake of profit, they are preparing to prolong and expand the Korean War, and they do not hesitate to use continuous wars of aggression to control the whole world. Therefore, surrendering to the United States is tantamount to surrendering to war. Today, the governments and countries that support the illegal and unreasonable position of the United States will be extorted by the U.S. imperialists, according to the same illegal and unreasonable position, to pay people and money to support its actions to prolong and expand the war. This is tantamount to inviting war for one's own country and people, and bringing unparalleled disasters to the whole world.

Therefore, the illegal resolution of the UN General Assembly on December 3rd is not a way to solve the problem and stop the war. On the contrary, it is precisely the way to make the problem more difficult to solve and to make it easier for the United States to prolong and expand the war. This illegal resolution will allow the suffering of the Korean people to continue and make it impossible to stop the casualties of soldiers on both sides. In order to stop this situation and to prevent greater troubles, today there is only the proposal in Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram in reply to Mr. Pearson, Chairman of the UN General Assembly, on December 14th. First, the UN General Assembly should cancel the illegal resolution passed on December 3rd, and instruct the U.S. government to immediately resume the Korean armistice negotiations. In accordance with the suggestions of Mr. Vishinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, on November 10th and November 24th, a comprehensive ceasefire should be implemented first according to the draft armistice agreement, and then the issue of total repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the "Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question" as stipulated in the Soviet proposal. Only in this way can the current Korean war be stopped first, so that the United Nations can gradually return to the work it should do to resolve international disputes in a spirit of consultation, rather than the work it should not do to serve the aggressive interests of the United States.

Peace-loving people all over the world are demanding in unison to stop the current Korean war first, repatriate all prisoners of war on both sides, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Today, outstanding representatives of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people are holding a meeting in Vienna, working actively for this major peace task. This effort was also expressed in a completely consistent and enthusiastic manner at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing not long ago. Although the United States and other countries that follow the United States in the United Nations refuse to stop the war first in Korea and repatriate all prisoners of war, the demands of the people cannot be submerged; the voices of the people are becoming more and more magnificent. We firmly believe that the just demand to stop the current Korean war first and repatriate all prisoners of war on both sides, supported by hundreds of millions of people, will inevitably win in the end.

### 人民的正义要求必然要得到最后胜利

    人民的正义要求必然要得到最后胜利
    我国外交部部长周恩来于十二月十四日电覆联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊，对联合国大会在拒绝中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国出席的情况之下所悍然通过的支持美国政府违反国际公约、强迫扣留战俘的立场以利其继续并扩大朝鲜侵略战争的决议案，认为是非法的、无效的，并表示坚决反对。同时，周恩来外长提出，要求联合国大会取消这个非法决议案，责成美国政府立即恢复朝鲜停战谈判，并根据朝鲜停战协定草案，首先实行全面停战，然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交由苏联在十一月十日和十一月二十四日提案所规定的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决。周外长这一声明完全是中国人民的正义要求的集中表现。全中国人民对此，表示一致的全力的拥护和支持。
    早在一九五一年二月联合国第六届大会即已听从美国的指挥，强制通过了一个与中国人民为敌的、肆意诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的无耻的诽谤决议。现在，联合国第七届大会竟又蔑视朝中人民公平合理的主张，破坏国际公约的庄严原则，违背全世界爱好和平人民对恢复朝鲜和平的热烈愿望，通过了上述可耻的非法决议案来支持美国的所谓
    “自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留战俘的主张，并借此替美国的延长并扩大侵朝战争的阴谋大开方便之门。这显然表示联合国正在更进一步地把自己变成美国的侵略政策的工具。全世界爱好和平的人民对此是不能够容忍的。
    联合国大会根据印度提案所通过的非法决议案口口声声说什么肯定战俘之释放与遣返应按照一九四九年日内瓦公约、国际公法中已经确立的原则与惯例以及停战协定草案中有关的规定来执行。但是，同一非法决议案紧跟着又说什么肯定不应对战俘施用武力以强使他们回返家乡。这后一规定的实施在实质上就取消了日内瓦公约、国际惯例和停战协定草案中的有关条文所一致肯定了的全部遣返战俘的原则。
    无论这一非法决议案和皮尔逊先生十二月五日的来电怎样搬弄日内瓦公约的名词，但所有有关战俘的国际公约中所规定的无条件遣返全部战俘的原则，都彰明较著地与联合国非法决议案所支持的美国的在停战后强迫扣留战俘的主张截然相反。
    无条件全部遣返战俘的原则早在一八九九年第一次海牙保和会公约的陆地战例条约所附的陆地战例章程第二十条已有规定。一九○七年第二次海牙保和会的陆战法规及惯例所附的关于陆战法规及惯例章程第二十条又加以重申。它经过一九二九年日内瓦公约第七十五条的规定而最后完备地、明确地形成为一九四九年日内瓦公约第一百一十八条和第一百一十九条。第一百一十八条说“实际战争终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。”为了防止拘留国家使用任何藉口来违反这一原则或延迟遣返起见，该条更进一步作如下的规定：“冲突各方为停战而缔结之规定中，如无关于上述事项之规定，或不能成立此项规定者，各拘留国应即照前项所规定之原则，自行制定并执行遣返计划，不得迟延。”同一公约第一百一十九条在肯定前条的各种原则之后，并进一步严格指出：“应依冲突各方间之协议，设立委员会以寻觅散失之战俘，并保证彼等之迅速遣返。”
    在朝鲜停战谈判中，经过双方协议的停战协定草案，根据上述国际公约和国际惯例的公认原则，对于双方战俘的释放与遣返，作了同样的规定。该草案第五十一条说：“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。此项战俘的释放与遣返，须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之。”
    上述国际公约、国际惯例和停战协定草案的原则与联合国非法决议案所谓的“不以武力强使战俘回返家乡”有什么相似之处呢？没有，丝毫没有。正相反，根据日内瓦公约第七条的规定，所谓“不以武力强使战俘回返家乡”就完全没有任何立足的余地。该条说：“在任何情况下，战俘不得放弃本公约或上条所述特别协定——如其订有是项协定——所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部。”关于这点，一九四九年日内瓦国际会议曾加以详细讨论。在那次会议中，特别委员会曾讨论一个提案：“战俘在任何情况下不得被强制或用其他胁迫方法诱使放弃本公约……所赋予彼等的不可割让的权利之一部或全部。”特别委员会否决了这个提案，理由是：第一、禁止放弃的权利不应限于“不可割让的”权利，而是所有权利；第二、禁止的放弃行为不应限于由于“强制或用其他胁迫方法诱使”而成的放弃行为，而是一切放弃行为。由此可见，日内瓦公约不是没有考虑到所谓“战俘不愿回家”的恶劣情况会被制造出来，因而产生所谓“自愿放弃”的藉口的。并且，正因为考虑到了这种所谓“自愿放弃”就是“强迫放弃”，也就是“不强迫遣返”，因此，它才作出第七条的规定以消除任何所谓“不以武力强使战俘回家”的藉口。这岂不明明表示日内瓦公约不仅是不赞成实际上是扣留战俘的所谓“不以武力强使战俘回家”，而且是反对有这样一种假定以免拘留国利用它的名义来实行强迫扣留么？
    其实，所谓“不以武力强使战俘回家”和美国的
    “自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”正是一个东西。这已由联合国内外的新闻报道和官方发言，包括皮尔逊先生自己的言论所充分证实。而所谓“自愿遣返”等等与国际公约的全部遣返原则毫无相似之处的事实，甚至连美英方面都不断有人承认。根据英国新闻处伦敦十二月一日电，曼彻斯特卫报就说：“严格地研究日内瓦公约，则发觉联合国的遣返战俘立场与该公约是的确有冲突的。”美国的罗斯福夫人甚至因为所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”违反了国际公约，竟在纽约世界电讯太阳报上公开主张：美国不能过于遵守各种国际公约。
    从这里，难道我们还不能得出一个结论：所谓
    “不以武力强使战俘回家”是与日内瓦公约的全部遣返原则不能两立的东西吗？联合国大会难道会看不清这一点吗？明知如此，而强说不是如此，这显然是在玩弄花样，希图把日内瓦公约的帽子戴在美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”，实即强迫扣留战俘主张的头上，一方面借以来欺骗世人，使美国在停战以后强迫扣留战俘的毒计得以实现，另一方面，又企图把美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”与日内瓦公约混在一起，借此来模糊日内瓦公约所明确规定的无条件遣返全部战俘的原则。这种狡诈企图充分说明联合国大会明知美国的无理主张见不得人，说不出口，而偏要枉法歪理来为美国服务的居心。假如朝中人民容许这一欺骗人民、破坏国际公约的主张实施，那么，在今天的国际关系上还能够有什么正义存在，还能够有什么准则可循？为此，周恩来外长才郑重声明：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府坚决地遵守和维护在停战生效后遣返全部战俘的日内瓦公约的根本原则，并将继续坚决地遵守和维护这一原则。”这正是全中国人民的一致主张。
    联合国非法决议案和皮尔逊先生的来电满口国际公约，而实际上则以美国用屠杀战俘政策所制造出来的所谓“战俘不愿回家”的藉口为根据，来主张所谓“不以武力强使战俘回家”，实即美国的“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”。这是何等违反人道、不顾事实的蛮横行为？！
    事实是，美国为了扣留战俘以便破坏它被迫进入的朝鲜停战谈判，在谈判尚未开始时，即已制定了
    一个扣俘政策。
    按照美国星期六晚邮报一九五二年十一月一日的报道，早在一九五一年七月五日，即朝鲜停战谈判开始之前约五天，由美国总统及国务卿等人所组织的美国国家安全委员会，即已根据美国联合参谋本部及陆军心理作战局的建议，制定了所谓“自愿遣返”的政策。同时，美国军队在战俘营中立即采取行动，制造所谓“朝中战俘不愿遣返”的事件，作为强迫扣留战俘的藉口。
    上述星期六晚邮报说：“一九五一年七月谈判开始之时，至少有一打美国的与联合国的机构到俘虏中工作，名义上是在第八军的监督之下。情报机构经常讯问战俘，心理战机构和宣传机构进行几乎是连续不断的调查，军队的民事宣传教育科订出了繁复的教育课程。”
    这种讯问、调查和“教育”逐渐正式以所谓“甄别”的名义出现，由美国、李承晚、蒋介石三方面的特务共同进行。
    这样，朝中被俘人员就开始了战俘从来没有遭遇过的巨大灾难。美国用军队、机关枪来强迫战俘承受非法甄别，并强迫他们在身上刺上侮辱和叛国的字样，强迫他们在背叛祖国的血书上打血指印。有不从者就当场打死打伤，或打至昏迷而后由特务在他们的身上刺字。有的战俘事后用刀剜去已被刺字的一块肉，美国特务们就把他们加以毒打，然后又把他们送到所谓“苦役营”的第七十一号营去。根据美国空降的蒋介石匪帮特务王家悌的口供，所谓“战俘不愿回家的请愿书”即由一个蒋介石派来的
    “县长”张兴登执笔写出，并不给战俘看，就用空白纸逼使战俘在上面签字，打血手印，然后将这些签字纸与请愿书订在一起交给美军。有时因美军方面限令紧急，即由特务等在空白纸上自盖指印，签上战俘的名字，即作为“战俘不愿回家”的根据。在战俘被迫刺字、打血印之后，美国侵略者更进一步将他们照像，以作威胁的凭据，并当场胁迫战俘说：
    “刺了字就不能再回去了，不反共也要你反共。”
    尽管美国强盗们这样残暴无耻地强迫战俘表示不忠于祖国，朝中被俘人员却至死不屈地进行了英勇反抗。美国侵略者为了对付这种反抗，竟调来几个师的兵力，包括空运部队，使用了坦克、毒气、火焰喷射器、手榴弹等等作战武器来攻击徒手战俘，进行大批屠杀。过去一年里仅仅根据美国官方自己发表的和红十字国际委员会的报告，朝中被俘人员因拒绝表示所谓“不回家的愿望”而被美国侵略者所打死打伤的已经达三千人以上。这些当然是极不完全的数字。即如我们所知的一九五一年屠杀数字都是在一九五二年才得到的。这可见美方隐匿起来的杀人数字尚不知究竟有多少。这一切不仅已由美、英、法等国的新闻报道证明，甚至连美国的柯尔生、杜德等当事人和红十字国际委员会也都坦白承认。
    上述一切完全证明：美国侵略者所谓的“战俘不回家的愿望”，一律都是美国方面为了强迫扣留战俘而用刺刀尖制造出来的，其中甚至有许多所谓刺字、签字、打手印等完全为美国方面所捏造。美国方面以他们蓄意制造的东西为根据，进行栽赃，一方面以此胁迫战俘，不许回家；另一方面又以此为藉口，向朝中方面无理要求所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”。像美国这种在国际关系上所进行的普通刑事犯的犯罪行为，联合国大会竟不但不加以谴责，而且还居然以这些犯罪行为作根据，来支持美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”，这还能算是一个有是非、有公道的国际组织吗？这正如周外长所指出的：“全世界公正人士对于联合国大会这样堕落的行为，不能不感到惊讶和愤慨。”
    就以这样罪恶的虚伪的东西为根据，联合国非法决议案提出了所谓将战俘交给中立国遣返委员会的办法。这样一个办法当然是不可能解决战俘的全部遣返问题的。基督教圣经说，好树里长出好果子，坏树里只能长出坏果子。既以美国的犯罪行为作根据，承认了战俘有所谓“不回家的愿望”，这个非法决议就进一步规定了有这种所谓“愿望”的战俘要在停战生效后的一百二十天以后被交到联合国去，不许回家。这真是周外长所指出的：是荒唐达于极点的建议。难道联合国中提出并通过这个非法决议案的各国代表们竟然忘记了联合国正是朝鲜战争交战双方中的一方么？现在却将美国要扣留的战俘交给联合国，其结果岂不恰恰就是交给美国？在这样一个圈套之下，所谓的将战俘交给中立国遣返委员会去管理并进行访问解释，岂不完全是为了替美国强迫扣留战俘打掩护？
    假如联合国非法决议案提案人梅农先生及其他许多国家的代表不来故意无视事实，他们就会承认所谓战俘“不回家的愿望”既是美国方面所制造的、而实际上并不存在的东西，那么，全部遣返战俘的问题就只须经过将战俘交给对方访问解释即可解决，而且也只有经过这个办法才能解决。因为战俘既被美方刺了叛国字样和打了手印，又被照了像，并经常遭受着美、李、蒋三种特务的各种胁迫，精神上背负了极大的重担。如果不把他们交给自己一方的人，则随来的特务必然继续进行胁迫，使他们还是不能回家。因此，只有把他们交给自己一方的人，则特务可能因恐惧而不敢同来，或即使同来了，也因极易与战俘区别开来而不可能发生作用。这样，就首先解除了战俘所受的胁迫，而可以顺利地对他们进行访问解释，并按国籍地区分类，最后使他们按照分类安然全部遣返回家。朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成、中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀两将军在十月十六日致克拉克信中所提出的就是这样一个公平合理、能够解决问题的办法。
    联合国中某些国家明知金、彭两将军的办法是公平合理的，是能够解决问题的；同时，它们又明知苏联外长维辛斯基十一月二十四日所提主张首先停战的提案是能够立即使朝鲜停战实现的，然而他们却偏要追随美国，他们以为只要迁就了美国，重复了第二次世界大战以前的绥靖政策，就可以取得停战，取得和平。殊不知美帝国主义侵略者是人类有史以来最贪馋、最野心的侵略者。他们的垄断资本追求庞大利润的欲望是没有限度的。为了利润，他们正在准备延长并扩大朝鲜战争，并不惜以连续的侵略战争来控制全世界。因此，向美国屈服，就无异于向战争屈服。今天支持美国非法无理立场的政府与国家，明天就要被美帝国主义者根据同样非法无理的立场来勒索出人出钱，以支持它的延长并扩大战争的行动。这就无异于为自己的国家和人民邀请战争，并且给全世界带来无比的灾祸。
    因此，联合国大会十二月三日的非法决议案不是解决问题停止战争的道路，正相反，它恰恰是使问题更加不易解决，使美国更易于延长并扩大战争的道路。这一非法决议案将使朝鲜人民的灾难继续下去，使双方士兵的伤亡无法停止。为了制止这一情况，为了防止更大的后患，今天就只有按照周外长十二月十四日致联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生复电中的提议，首先由联合国大会取消上述十二月三日所通过的非法决议案，责成美国政府立即恢复朝鲜停战谈判，并按照苏联出席联合国代表团团长维辛斯基先生十一月十日和十一月二十四日的建议，根据停战协定草案先行全面停战，然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交由苏联提案中所规定的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决。只有这样，才能首先停止朝鲜现行战争，从而使联合国逐渐回到它所应做的以协商精神解决国际纠纷的工作，而不是它所不应做的为美国侵略利益服务的工作。
    全世界爱好和平人民都在众口一声要求首先停止朝鲜现行战争，遣返双方全部战俘，和平解决朝鲜问题。今天在维也纳正有着全体亿万爱好和平人民的卓越的代表们在那里举行集会，为了这一重大的和平任务而积极努力。这一努力在不久前于北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上也有了完全一致的热烈表现。尽管在联合国中美国及其他跟随美国的国家拒绝在朝鲜首先停战，遣返全部战俘，但是，人民的要求是不可能被淹没的；人民的呼声是愈来愈雄壮的。我们坚决相信，有着亿万人民支持的首先停止朝鲜现行战争，遣返双方全部战俘的正义要求，最后是必然要胜利的。
