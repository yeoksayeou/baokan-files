The Northwest China Company of China Department Store established a purchasing and supply wholesale station in Xi'an. Combining this with the movement to promote the sale of stockpiled goods, both the establishment of the station and the sales work achieved positive results.

In late October, the Northwest China Company of China Department Store concentrated cadres at the section chief level and above to study the implementation of the economic accounting system and the work of establishing the station, criticized erroneous thinking, and at the same time mobilized employees to clear warehouses and sort goods. During the inventory clearance, it was discovered that more than 140 types of goods were stockpiled due to blind purchasing in the past. The company then held an "Exhibition of Stockpiled Goods" to educate all cadres about the harm of supply system thinking to state-owned trade work, laying the ideological foundation for implementing the economic accounting system and establishing a wholesale station. Subsequently, in the work of establishing the station, employees were mobilized to complete the fourth quarter sales plan, sales meetings, forums for model trade workers, and award ceremonies were held, a special sales system was established, and a rationalization proposal campaign was launched. After this series of education, the enthusiasm of the salespersons for promoting the sale of stockpiled goods was generally enhanced, and plans were quickly drawn up to sell all stockpiled goods on schedule.

After the Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station was officially established on December 1st, the China Department Store, based on Xi'an's experience, sent a working group to Lanzhou to assist in the establishment of a purchasing and supply wholesale station.

    西北区百货公司建立批发站
    中国百货公司西北区公司在西安市建立采购供应批发站，结合了推销积压商品运动，使建站与推销工作都获得了成绩。
    中国百货公司西北区公司在十月下旬集中科长级以上干部学习实行经济核算制和建站工作，批判错误思想，同时发动职工清理仓库，进行商品排队。在清仓中发现过去因盲目进货，积压的商品共有一百四十多种。该公司遂举行了“积压商品展览会”，教育全体干部认识供给制思想对国营贸易工作的危害，奠定实行经济核算制、建立批发站的思想基础。接着在建站工作中发动职工完成第四季度推销计划，召开推销会议、模范贸易工作者座谈会、发奖大会，订立专责推销制度，展开合理化建议运动。销货员经过这一系列的教育，推销积压商品的积极性普遍提高，很快订出按期销完全部积压商品的计划。
    西安市采购供应批发站十二月一日正式成立后，中国百货公司根据西安市的经验，派出工作组到兰州协助建立采购供应批发站。
