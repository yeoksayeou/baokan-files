Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editorial comrades: We fully accept the criticisms made by readers in the "Reader's Letters" section on August 9 regarding the chaotic phenomena in our store's periodical distribution work. The main reasons for this chaotic situation, as pointed out in the brief commentary, are: firstly, we have provided inadequate political education for our distribution staff on a regular basis, resulting in some distribution staff being irresponsible in their work; secondly, the periodical distribution system is no longer entirely suitable for the new situation.
    Regarding work attitude, we should first examine our guiding ideology for periodical distribution work. In the past, we have not done enough to improve the political awareness of our comrades, to recognize the importance of distribution work from a political perspective, and to establish a service-oriented mindset for readers. Last year, Xinhua Bookstore nationwide sold approximately 100 million copies of periodicals, an unprecedented distribution scale in Chinese history. Faced with this new situation, we must create new working methods to meet objective requirements. However, we have not relied on all employees of the store, tapped into the wisdom and initiative of the masses, and systematically promoted good experiences in a timely manner. At the same time, our empiricism and conservative thinking have also hindered us from learning from the advanced experiences of advanced countries. This non-political tendency in the leadership of the main store is obviously the main reason why our work cannot be improved quickly. Secondly, we also convened three meetings of all staff in the periodical shipping and subscriber management departments in Beijing, exposing many errors caused by irresponsible work attitudes in various departments, and examining everyone's attitude towards revolutionary work in conjunction with each work error. After discussion, everyone realized that many errors in our work are caused by a lack of attention to periodical distribution work and individualistic thinking. Without correcting this erroneous thinking, it is impossible to do a good job in periodical distribution.
    We have also initially studied some improvement methods, such as establishing a "circulation form" so that each stage of the subscriber handling process has a record and inspection. Establish an "error registration book" to regularly summarize and publicize it, and use vivid facts to educate everyone. Implement a responsibility system. A test was also held for temporary workers responsible for packaging, and those with a good work attitude were selected to become formal employees, correcting the purely economic viewpoint of temporary workers. The finance department made a concentrated effort to process the backlog of refunds. Regarding the various difficult problems encountered in the work, we are now mobilizing the masses to use their brains to find solutions. In addition, the North China General Branch also stipulates that Wednesday mornings are for business learning.
    Regarding the periodical distribution system, in order to reverse the passive and blind state of periodical distribution work and reduce the waste of manpower and resources, we must learn from the advanced experience of planned distribution in the Soviet Union and change the distribution system of "subscribing and sending at any time." In August of last year, we drafted a "Periodic Subscription System" proposal, proposing the slogan "pre-order as the main, retail as the auxiliary," and invited relevant units to discuss it several times, and distributed it to various publishing houses and other relevant parties for comments. Within the bookstore, general branches in major administrative regions held symposiums with local publishing and distribution units, and arranged for national branch stores to conduct deliberation and research. After a year of research and revision, this plan is largely complete. We have decided to submit it to the Publication Administration for review and approval before starting trial implementation.
    In addition, there are some objective difficulties in the periodical distribution work that we would like to raise for everyone to study:
    1. Currently, the work of various publishing houses is not well planned, and there are many changes in periodical prices, schedules, supplements, combined issues, suspensions, and non-punctual publishing, and printing errors, which add some practical difficulties to the distribution departments. For example, "People's Literature" notified us on December 26, 1951, that the first issue of 1952 would be increased from the original price of 5,400 yuan per copy to 5,800 yuan; on January 10 of this year, it was notified that it would be reduced to 5,000 yuan from the second issue, and the two notices were only fifteen days apart. This change not only increased our continuous issuance of notices to thousands of subscription stores across the country to change subscription prices, but also caused many subscription stores to collect the wrong subscription fees, causing new and old subscribers to write letters with opinions. The subscription section inquiry group therefore accumulated a lot of letters, and the internal accounting work was also chaotic.... In addition, the publication dates of many periodicals are mostly concentrated on the 1st or 16th of each month. This also puts pressure on our distribution forces, resulting in busyness and backlog.
    2. Because the publication dates of periodicals are mostly squeezed together, the daily distribution volume is extremely unbalanced. For example, most of the periodicals we send from Beijing to the country are entrusted to the postal service for delivery. The organization and coordination of transportation forces will therefore also encounter difficulties; sometimes, too many books and periodicals are sent at the same time, and more than 200,000 pieces of mail are sent in one day, exceeding the daily delivery volume of the postal authorities, which also affects the receiving time.
    3. Changes in the mailing addresses of periodical subscribers and the poor receiving and distribution work of some units also add some difficulties to our work.
    We will certainly take the initiative to establish close contact with relevant units and readers to jointly overcome and improve the difficulties caused by these objective reasons in the future.
    Finally, we hope that readers will continue to offer us opinions to help us improve our work.

### 新华书店总店接受读者意见  研究了改进期刊发行工作办法

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    新华书店总店接受读者意见
    研究了改进期刊发行工作办法
    编辑同志：八月九日“读者来信专页”所载读者对我店期刊发行工作中的混乱现象所提出的批评，我们完全接受。造成这种混乱现象的主要原因，正如简评所指出的：首先是我们平日对发行工作人员的政治教育太差，致使某些发行工作人员对工作不负责任；其次是期刊发行制度已不完全适合新的情况。
    在工作态度方面，首先应该检讨我们对期刊发行工作的领导思想。过去我们对提高同志们的政治觉悟，从政治上来认识发行工作的重要性，树立为读者服务的思想等做得很不够。全国新华书店去年一年售出期刊约一亿册，这是中国历史上空前的发行规模。面对这种新的形势，必须创造新的工作方法来适应客观要求。但是我们没有依靠全店职工，发挥群众的智慧和积极性，及时总结好的经验并有系统地推广。同时，由于我们的经验主义和保守思想，也障碍了我们对先进国家的先进经验的学习。总店领导工作上的这种非政治倾向，显然是我们工作不能很快提高的主要原因。其次，我们还召集在北京的期刊发货部门和订户管理部门的全体工作人员开了三次会，揭发了各个部门中存在的很多不负责任的工作态度所造成的错误，并结合每一项工作的错误来检查每个人对革命工作的态度。大家经过讨论，认识了：我们工作中很多错误是由于不重视期刊发行工作和个人主义的思想所造成的。不端正这种错误思想，期刊发行工作是不可能作好的。
    我们也初步研究了一些改进的办法，如建立“周转单”，使订户处理过程中的每一个段落都有一定的记录和检查。建立“错误登记簿”，定期总结公布，用活生生的事实向大家进行教育。推行责任制。对负责包装的临时工也举行了一次考试，选择工作态度好的转为正式职工，纠正了临时工作人员的单纯经济观点。财务室突击处理了积压的退款。对于工作中所发生的种种疑难问题，现正在发动群众开动脑筋找窍门，研究解决办法。此外，华北总分店并规定以每星期三上半天为业务学习时间。
    关于期刊发行制度方面，要扭转期刊发行工作的被动盲目状态和减少人力、物力的浪费，必须学习苏联计划发行的先进经验，改变“随时收订，随时寄发”的发行制度。去年八月间我们即草拟了“期刊定期收订制”的方案，提出“预订为主，零售为辅”的口号，曾数次邀请有关单位进行讨论，并分寄各出版社和其他有关方面征求意见。在书店内部，由各大行政区的总分店与当地出版发行等有关单位举行座谈会，并布置全国分支店进行酝酿研究。经过一年来的研究和修正，这个方案已大体完整。我们决定把它提交出版总署审查通过后开始试行。
    此外，在期刊发行工作中也有一些客观困难，我们愿意提出来供大家研究：
    一，目前各出版社的工作还没有很好的计划化，期刊改价、改期、增刊、合刊、休刊及不按期出版，不准时送刊，印刷错误等情况较多，这给发行部门增加了一些实际困难。如“人民文学”一九五一年十二月二十六日通知我们要把一九五二年的第一期从原定价每本五千四百元增加到五千八百元；今年一月十日，又通知自第二期起减为五千元，而两个通知相隔仅十五天。这个变动不但增加了我们连续向全国几千个收订店发了改变订阅价格的通知，并且很多收订店因而收错订费，引起新旧订户纷纷来信提出意见。订阅科查询组因此积压很多信件，内部账务工作也因此混乱……。此外，很多期刊的出版日期，大部都集中在每月一日或十六日。这也使我们发行力量感到困难，因而形成了忙乱和积压。
    二，由于期刊的出版日期大部挤在一起，每天发行数量极不平衡，如我们从北京寄发全国的期刊大部委托邮政局寄发。运输力量的组织配合因而也会发生困难；有时同时寄发的书刊太多，一天要发二十多万个邮件，超过了邮运机关每天的发货量，这也就影响到收件时间。
    三，订阅期刊的读者更改寄刊地址以及某些单位收发工作较差的情况，也使我们的工作增加了一些困难。
    这些客观原因所造成的困难，今后我们一定主动与有关单位及读者群众取得密切联系，共同加以克服和改进。
    最后，希望读者继续向我们提出意见，帮助我们改进工作。
