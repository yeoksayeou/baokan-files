    (I) Stalin's Voice Encourages the People of the World
    Stalin's reply to the questions raised by James Reston, a diplomatic correspondent for the American "New York Times," once again clearly elucidated the Soviet Union's peace policy and the Soviet Union's sincere desire for peace. This is a heavy blow to those warmongers in the United States who are frantically implementing a policy of arms expansion and war preparations, and desperately advocating a new world war; and it greatly encourages the struggle of peace-loving people all over the world to strive for peace.
    In his reply, Stalin explicitly pointed out: "It cannot be considered that war between the United States of America and the Soviet Union is inevitable, and our two countries can coexist peacefully in the future." This means that war between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp is not inevitable.
    In March of this year, Stalin said in reply to questions raised by a group of American local newspaper editors: "If there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then the peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is entirely possible." The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have repeatedly expressed this desire for peace, consistently adhered to a policy of peace, always respected the sovereignty and independence of other countries, not interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, and advocated the development of international economic trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Now, Stalin has once again expressed the great desire of the Soviet Union to sincerely eliminate international tensions and strive for lasting world peace. All the provocative conspiracies of those bourgeois propagandists and warmongers who are accustomed to slandering the Soviet Union for "propaganda" purposes are completely shattered.
    So, where does the current international tension come from? Stalin replied that its source is "in all the aggressive actions of the anti-Soviet 'Cold War' policy that are displayed in places and matters." As is known to all, the current Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are engaged in large-scale peaceful economic construction to improve the living standards of the people; while the capitalist countries, due to the disintegration of the unified and all-encompassing world market after the Second World War, their internal general crisis is further deepening, and they are competing for markets and resources for their own interests, attempting to escape the serious economic crisis they are facing. The United States is trying its best to use the "Marshall Plan," the war of aggression against Korea, the arms race, and the militarization of industry to maintain the highest profits of monopoly capitalists and alleviate its economic crisis. The American aggressors who created the anti-Soviet "Cold War" not only threaten the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, but also primarily and massively infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of other countries. Now, even capitalist countries such as Britain and France have increasingly seen clearly that it is not the Soviet Union or the people's democratic countries that are seizing their interests, infringing upon their national sovereignty and independence, interfering in their internal affairs, and threatening their survival, but their "friend" the United States. American financial groups, like the Hitlerite German and Japanese fascist military cliques in the past, are using the slogan of opposing the Soviet Union to plunder the interests of other capitalist countries. Their real purpose in carrying out the anti-Soviet "Cold War" and creating a tense international situation lies here.
    For the sake of the peaceful interests of the people of the world, and in order to change the tense international situation, Stalin expressed that the Soviet Union welcomes the proposal to hold diplomatic talks with representatives of the Eisenhower government in order to consider the possibility of a meeting between him and Eisenhower.
    Stalin once again expressed that the Soviet Union is concerned about ending the Korean War and agreed to cooperate on any new diplomatic measures aimed at ending the Korean War. This demonstrates the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union to safeguard peace in Korea and Asia and eliminate international tensions. Since the United States launched a barbaric war of aggression in Korea, the Soviet Union has made many major efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and has constantly issued just appeals at various international conferences, putting forward fair and reasonable solutions. However, this sincere effort by the Soviet Union has been obstructed and undermined by the United States every time. At the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, on November 10th and 24th, was the fairest and most reasonable. If this Soviet proposal had been adopted, a Korean armistice could have been achieved immediately. However, the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, rejected this fair and reasonable proposal and passed an illegal resolution based on the Indian proposal that supported the US position. This illegal resolution violated the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and made it impossible to achieve a Korean armistice. The United States provoked the war of aggression against Korea and sabotaged the armistice negotiations, and is now plotting to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea, but the American aggressors dream of putting the responsibility for the Korean War not ending on others. Stalin's speech thoroughly exposed the masks of these conspirators. Stalin called on the people of the world to fight for peace; under his call, the just struggle of the people of the world will surely be victorious.

### （一）斯大林的声音鼓舞着全世界的人民

    （一）斯大林的声音鼓舞着全世界的人民
    斯大林对于美国“纽约时报”外交记者詹姆斯·赖斯顿所提出的问题的答复，再一次清楚地阐明了苏联的和平政策以及苏联对于和平的真诚愿望。这对于美国那些疯狂实行扩军备战政策，拚命鼓吹新的世界战争的战争贩子们，是一个沉重的打击；并使全世界爱好和平人民争取和平的斗争，得到极大的鼓舞。
    斯大林在他的答复中明确地指出：“不能认为美利坚合众国和苏联之间的战争是不可避免的，我们两国在今后也能够和平共处。”这就是说，资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的战争不是不可避免的。
    斯大林在今年三月答复一批美国地方报纸编辑所提出的问题时说：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那么资本主义与共产主义的和平共处就是十分可能的。”苏联和各人民民主国家曾一再表示这种和平的愿望，始终坚持和平政策，始终尊重他国主权和独立，不干涉他国内政，并主张在平等互利的基础上发展国际间的经济贸易。现在，斯大林再一次表示苏联真诚地希望消除国际间紧张形势，争取世界持久和平的伟大意愿。那些平日为了“宣传”的目的而惯于诽谤苏联的资产阶级御用宣传家和战争贩子们的一切挑拨阴谋完全被粉碎了。
    那么，目前的国际紧张形势的来源何在呢？斯大林回答说，它的来源是“在一切只要反苏‘冷战’政策的侵略行动显示出来的地方和事情上”。举世周知，现在的苏联和各人民民主国家，正在紧张地进行大规模的和平经济建设，以提高人民的生活水平；而资本主义各国，由于第二次世界大战后统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解，它们内部的总危机正在进一步加深，它们为了各自的利益，正在争夺市场和资源，企图逃避面临着的严重经济危机。美国竭力想用“马歇尔计划”、侵朝战争、军备竞争、工业军事化来保持垄断资本家的最高利润，缓和它的经济危机。制造反苏“冷战”的美国侵略者不但威胁着苏联和人民民主国家，而且首先大规模地侵犯着其他国家的主权和独立。现在，甚至英法等资本主义国家也已越来越看得清楚：夺取它们的利益，侵犯它们国家的主权和独立，干涉它们的内政，威胁它们的生存的不是苏联或人民民主国家，而是它们的“朋友”美国。美国财阀像过去希特勒德国和日本法西斯军阀一样，利用反对苏联的口号抢夺着其他资本主义国家的利益。他们所以要进行反苏“冷战”，制造紧张的国际局势，其真实的目的就在这里。
    斯大林为了世界人民的和平利益，为了改变国际的紧张局势，表示苏联欢迎和艾森豪威尔政府的代表举行外交会谈，以便考虑他和艾森豪威尔进行会晤的可能性的建议。
    斯大林再一次表示苏联是关心结束朝鲜战争的，并同意在任何以结束朝鲜战争为目的的新的外交措施上进行合作。这表现了苏联维护朝鲜与亚洲和平、消除国际紧张局势的真诚努力。自美国在朝鲜发动野蛮的侵略战争以来，苏联为了获致朝鲜问题的和平解决，曾作过许多重大的努力，并在各种国际性会议上不断发出正义的呼吁，提出了公平合理的解决办法。可是，苏联的这种真诚的努力，却每次都遭到美国的阻挠和破坏。在联合国第七届大会上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于十一月十日和二十四日所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，是最为公平、最为合理的。苏联这个提案如果获得通过，朝鲜停战就可以立即实现。可是，联合国大会在美国操纵之下，拒绝了这个公平合理的提案，而根据支持美国主张的印度提案通过了非法决议。这个非法决议破坏了日内瓦战俘公约，使朝鲜停战无法实现。美国挑起了侵朝战争，破坏了停战谈判，现在正在阴谋继续和扩大侵朝战争，但是美国侵略者却梦想把朝鲜战争至今没有结束的责任放在旁人的身上。斯大林的谈话，彻底地戳穿了这些阴谋家的假面具。斯大林号召着全世界人民为争取和平而奋斗；在他的号召之下，世界人民的正义斗争必将得到胜利。
