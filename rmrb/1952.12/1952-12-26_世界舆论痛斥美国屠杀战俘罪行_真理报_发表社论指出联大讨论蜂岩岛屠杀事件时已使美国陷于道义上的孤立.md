    World Opinion Condemns US Atrocities Against Prisoners of War
    "Pravda" Editorial States UN Discussion of Geoje Island Massacre Has Left US Morally Isolated
    According to TASS: The "Pravda" newspaper on the 24th published an editorial commenting on the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by US military authorities on Geoje Island. The Soviet delegation has raised this issue for discussion at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    The editorial emphasized: The crimes committed by the US military authorities in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp are not accidental. They are a direct consequence of the policy adopted by the US ruling clique on the Korean issue, which is to continue the bloodshed in Korea so that the Wall Street tycoons can continue to obtain super profits, and to expand the aggression against Korea and China. The bloody Geoje Island incident that occurred on December 14th clearly illustrates what the Washington bigwigs mean when they say that prisoners of war refuse to go home. At the same time, this incident exposes the true meaning of the proposal on the Korean issue that the US-British bloc forced the United Nations General Assembly to accept. Using the prisoner of war issue to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, using the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 3rd to prolong the bloodshed in Korea, and to justify new incidents of collective massacres of prisoners of war – this is the purpose of the American aggressors.
    The editorial then pointed out: The US representatives and their lackeys attempted to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the Geoje Island atrocities, but they failed. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia pointed out the unprecedented crimes committed by the American aggressors against prisoners of war, and publicly accused the organizers and perpetrators of these crimes. Despite using all kinds of tricks, the US representatives could not shirk responsibility for these crimes, nor could they diminish the seriousness of the crimes committed by the US military in Korea.
    The editorial continued, during the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the bloody Geoje Island incident, the US delegation was morally isolated. Even the representatives of those countries that were accomplices in the US aggression against Korea adopted a special reserved attitude. Despite US pressure, the vast majority of delegations from Asian and Arab countries did not support the US delegation. Although the majority of the United Nations General Assembly followed US policy and did not support the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation, there is no doubt that the United States suffered a moral and political defeat in the discussion of this issue. The Soviet proposal has received the heartfelt support of world public opinion, which has resolutely protested against the brutal crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea.
    (Xinhua News Agency) [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 25th] The newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published an article on December 19th stating: The number of casualties among Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island "shows that the crimes committed by the US side on Geoje Island have exceeded the bloody crimes they committed on Koje Island." The article said that this recent massacre of prisoners of war is "another example of the countless bloody crimes committed by the US imperialists, and another undeniable proof of the aggressors' attempts to continue the Korean War."
    Prague's "Red Rights" wrote on December 21st under the title "Another Shameful Crime of the American Interventionists":
    "...The crimes committed by the interventionists against prisoners of war show that they have been exasperated by the failure of their aggressive conspiracies. All these atrocities cannot destroy the will of such people: the strength of these people lies in their recognition that the cause of their people is just." "Red Rights" continued: "The prisoners of war who were massacred on Geoje Island hope that the world will support the demands of the delegation of the People's Army at Panmunjom, as well as the demands of the Soviet delegation and the delegations of the peace camp attending the United Nations."
    The New York "Daily Worker" on December 19th cited a report published by the "International Committee of the Red Cross," commenting on the recent massacre of prisoners of war on Geoje Island. The "International Committee of the Red Cross" report denounced the US military command in Korea for violating international law by shooting Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island. The "Daily Worker" wrote: "...This is clearly an act of violating international law, just as the 'International Committee of the Red Cross' said that such acts are violations of international law... President Truman and President-elect Eisenhower both insist that they cannot end the Korean War because they must protect the prisoners who do not want to return home. But US Army officers are massacring these prisoners on a large scale – simply because they want to go home!"
    The New York "Sunday Worker" on December 21st cited the opinion of Fishman, Executive Secretary of the Lincoln Brigade Veterans Association, on the US military command's continued crimes of massacring prisoners of war. Fishman said: "The massacre...proves that the government's claim that they care about prisoners of war is a complete and utter lie."
    Belgium's "Red Flag" commented on December 16th: "This new crime vividly illustrates the reign of terror in the 'United Nations executioner's' prisoner of war camps. This crime once again shows the true intention of the claim of 'voluntary repatriation' – the US side is using this claim as an excuse to maintain the dangerous hotbed of the Korean War."

### 世界舆论痛斥美国屠杀战俘罪行  “真理报”发表社论指出联大讨论蜂岩岛屠杀事件时已使美国陷于道义上的孤立

    世界舆论痛斥美国屠杀战俘罪行
    “真理报”发表社论指出联大讨论蜂岩岛屠杀事件时已使美国陷于道义上的孤立
    据塔斯社讯：二十四日“真理报”在社论中评论蜂岩岛美国军事当局集体屠杀朝中战俘的事件，苏联代表团已把这个事件在联合国大会第七届会议上提出讨论。
    社论着重指出：美国军事当局在蜂岩岛战俘营所犯的罪行，并不是偶然的。这是美国统治集团在朝鲜问题上所采取的政策的直接后果，这种政策就是继续朝鲜的流血，使华尔街的大亨们继续得到超额的利润，这种政策就是扩大对朝鲜和中国的侵略。这次在十二月十四日发生的血腥的蜂岩岛事件，更清楚地说明了华盛顿的大人先生们所说的战俘拒绝回家是怎样一回事。同时，这个事件揭露了美英集团硬叫联合国大会接受的关于朝鲜问题的提案的真正意义。利用战俘问题来破坏朝鲜停战谈判，利用联合国大会在十二月三日通过的非法决议来延长朝鲜的流血，来为集体屠杀战俘的新事件辩护——这就是美国侵略者的目的。
    社论接着指出：美国代表和他们的仆从企图阻止联合国大会讨论蜂岩岛暴行，但是遭到了失败。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克指出美国侵略者对战俘所犯的空前罪行，并当众控告这种罪行的组织者和执行者。美国代表尽管使用了一切诡计，但是无法推脱这种罪行的责任，也无法缩小美军在朝鲜所犯的这种罪行的严重性。
    社论继续说，在联合国大会讨论蜂岩岛血腥事件时，美国代表团陷于道义上的孤立。甚至那些在美国侵略朝鲜战争中的帮凶国家的代表们，也采取了特殊的保留态度。尽管美国施以压力，但是绝大多数亚洲和阿拉伯国家的代表团不支持美国代表团。虽然联合国大会的多数派追随美国政策，不支持苏联代表团所提出的建议，但是无疑地，美国在讨论这个问题时遭到了道义上和政治上的失败。苏联的建议受到世界舆论的衷心支持，世界舆论对美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯的这种残酷罪行坚决地提出抗议。
    （新华社）【新华社布拉格二十五日电】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报于十二月十九日发表论文说：蜂岩岛战俘营中的朝中战俘伤亡的数字，“说明美方在蜂岩岛上所犯的罪行已经超过了他们在巨济岛所犯的血腥罪行”。论文说，最近发生的这次大规模屠杀战俘的罪行，是“美帝国主义者所犯的许许多多血腥罪行中的又一个例子，是侵略者企图继续进行朝鲜战争的又一个不容置辩的证据”。
    布拉格“红色权利报”于十二月二十一日在“美国干涉者的又一个可耻的罪行”的标题下写道：
    “……干涉者对战俘所犯的罪行，说明他们已因他们的侵略阴谋不能得逞而恼羞成怒。这一切暴行是摧毁不了这样的人的意志的：这些人的力量在于他们认识他们的人民的事业是正义的。”“红色权利报”接着说：“在蜂岩岛被屠杀的战俘希望全世界支持在板门店的人民军队的代表团的要求，以及出席联合国的苏联代表团与和平阵营的代表团的要求”。
    纽约“工人日报”于十二月十九日援引了“红十字国际委员会”发表的报告，评论最近发生的这次屠杀蜂岩岛上的战俘的事件，“红十字国际委员会”的报告斥责在朝鲜的美军司令部违反国际法枪杀巨济岛上的朝中战俘。“工人日报”写道：“……这显然是一种破坏国际法的行为，正如‘红十字国际委员会’所说的那种行为是破坏国际法的行为一样……杜鲁门总统和新当选的总统艾森豪威尔都硬说他们不能结束朝鲜战争，因为他们必须保护不愿回家的俘虏。但是美国陆军军官们却在大肆屠杀这些俘虏——只因他们希望回家！”
    纽约“工人日报星期刊”于十二月二十一日援引了林肯旅退伍军人协会执行秘书费希曼就美军司令部继续屠杀战俘的罪行发表的意见。费希曼说：“屠杀……证明政府说他们关心战俘完全是骗人的谎言。”
    比利时“红旗报”于十二月十六日评论道：“这种新罪行生动地说明了在‘联合国刽子手’俘虏营中的恐怖统治。这种罪行又一次说明‘自愿遣返’的主张的真正用意——美方就是以这种主张为藉口来维持朝鲜战争的危险温床的。”
