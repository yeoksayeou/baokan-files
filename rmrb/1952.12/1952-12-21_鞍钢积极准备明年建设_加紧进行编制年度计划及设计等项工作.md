    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Actively Prepares for Next Year's Construction
    Intensifying Efforts to Compile Annual Plans and Design Work

    [This newspaper dispatch] To greet the larger-scale basic construction tasks of 1953, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works basic construction department is undertaking intensive preparations.

    Beginning in October of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works basic construction department has universally listed the compilation of next year’s construction plan as one of the main tasks, with each unit holding general meetings of all employees to mobilize them. Currently, this work has been fully rolled out. Engineering projects have been determined, and the planning department has established a quota organization, compiling four categories of budgetary quotas for industrial construction of black metallurgy enterprises. The basic construction planning office has also launched a red flag competition. It is expected that the work of compiling the plan can be completed before December 25. This changes the situation last year when the plan was dragged on until the end of February or even March of this year before being completed, so that the basic construction work next year can have the whole year’s time.

    Simultaneous with the compilation of the annual plan, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works basic construction department, according to the main projects of the 1953 plan initially approved by the higher authorities, carried out a series of preparatory work for the basic construction projects of 1953.

    In terms of design, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works basic construction department first checked the design situation of the main foreign-designed projects listed for completion in 1953, clarifying which projects’ construction drawings had arrived and when those construction drawings could be delivered; and also studied several major projects designed by Anshan Iron and Steel Works itself, striving to complete the technical design before the end of the year. At the same time, without violating the principles stipulated in the preliminary design, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works basic construction department advanced the delivery of a number of manufacturing drawings (equipment drawings, parts drawings, refractory brick drawings) and construction drawings that could be finalized to the manufacturing and construction departments for manufacturing. In the area of blast furnace coke ovens alone, more than 400 drawings will soon be delivered to the manufacturing and construction departments. For general civil construction designs, it has been decided to adopt standard drawings to accelerate the design process. In the process of the work, the design department also strengthened its organization, improved its management methods, attached importance to the collection of original design data, and began to study the design tasks for the years after 1953.

    In order to ensure the correct progress of the design work, Anshan Iron and Steel Works is increasingly prioritizing survey and exploration work. The company is now establishing and supplementing various professional institutions, geological drilling teams, topographic surveying teams, and engineering geology teams. Materials for foreign designs are expected to be sent out before the end of the year; and engineering geological work to cooperate with Anshan Iron and Steel Works' internal designs is also actively underway.

    In order to timely complete the equipment ordering work, as early as July, Anshan Iron and Steel Works organized personnel to compile a five-year equipment ordering plan and a 1953 equipment ordering plan based on the preliminary design book for the development of the company. After review and research, hundreds of types of equipment, amounting to tens of thousands of tons, have been classified. Among them, foreign orders have been submitted; and after multiple consultations with relevant departments for the domestic part, agreements have been reached on some orders; and self-made parts will be gradually started to be made as the manufacturing drawings are completed. It is estimated that this work can be completed one quarter ahead of 1952. The preparation and reserve work for materials are also underway. Foreign materials have been ordered, and the internal material reserves of Anshan Iron and Steel Works have been checked. Plans for materials that need to be allocated by the state and produced by various provinces and cities have also been submitted. Tens of thousands of cubic meters of wood will be allocated before the end of the year, and more than 200 million red bricks needed for next year's construction have also been guaranteed.

    Next year, Anshan Iron and Steel Works will greatly improve the degree of factory and mechanical construction compared to this year. Earth excavation, hoisting, transportation, concrete mixing, tamping, and other hoisting work will be mechanized as much as possible. It is expected that the degree of construction mechanization will reach an average of about 60 percent. In order to further strengthen the responsibility system in construction and establish regular construction management, Anshan Iron and Steel Works has divided the 1953 projects into 12 work areas based on the main construction objects and construction areas, determined the responsible organizations and personnel for each work area, and determined the management principles of general contracting and subcontracting.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Works also plans to advance the construction of several projects within the 1953 plan that can be started in the first quarter as much as possible, in order to avoid repeating the phenomenon of large-scale idleness in the first quarter of each year in the past. Trades restricted by the season will concentrate workers for training to improve the technical level of the workers. At the same time, Anshan Iron and Steel Works fixed a large number of workers who must be fixed, and held temporary technical schools to train them in winter.

    Summarizing past experiences to improve the political and professional level of cadres is an important issue in improving future work. At the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Works deployed the basic construction department to comprehensively summarize the experience of 1952. The summary is divided into three types: the first is a comprehensive summary, the second is a summary by project nature, and the third is a special technical summary. Among them, the technical summary part includes more than 20 types, such as beam replacement, column replacement, fixed screw frame, center line, and underground line, which are summarized by the technical personnel directly responsible for the work. The first draft has been written and is being corrected by Soviet experts. The summary of these experiences will also play a significant role in the construction of other heavy industrial units across the country. In addition to mobilizing all personnel in the office to participate in this work, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works leadership also transferred more than 20 people from various business offices to participate in this work. Professional offices also conducted their own summaries separately.

    In order to directly learn from Soviet experts and quickly absorb advanced Soviet science and technology, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works basic construction department is organizing employees to learn Russian. The number of students learning Russian in the night schools run by various basic construction units alone has reached more than 1,300.

    The basic construction plan task of Anshan Iron and Steel Works this year is 8.8 times the actual completion of last year, and the task for next year will be twice the planned task for this year. Faced with such a glorious and arduous task, the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Works are actively preparing with excitement and tension.

    鞍钢积极准备明年建设
    加紧进行编制年度计划及设计等项工作
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门，为了迎接一九五三年更大规模的基本建设任务，正紧张地进行各项准备工作。
    从今年十月开始，鞍钢基本建设部门即普遍地把编制明年建设计划列为主要的任务之一，各单位分别召开了全体职工大会进行动员。目前这项工作已全面展开。工程项目已经确定，计划部门已成立了定额机构，编就了黑色冶金企业工业建设概算定额四类。基本建设计划处并展开了红旗竞赛运动。预计编制计划的工作可以在十二月二十五日前结束。这就改变了去年定计划拖至今年二月末甚至三月间才完成的情况，使明年基本建设工作的进行可以有整年的时间。
    与编制年度计划的同时，鞍钢基本建设部门根据上级初步批准的一九五三年计划的主要项目，对一九五三年的基本建设工程，进行了一系列的准备工作。
    在设计方面，鞍钢基本建设部门首先对列入一九五三年竣工的主要国外设计项目的设计情况进行了清查，弄清那些项目的施工图业已到达，那些施工图何时可以交付；对鞍钢自行设计的几项主要工程，也进行了研究，争取技术设计在年底前可以做好。同时，在不违背初步设计所规定的原则范围内，鞍钢基本建设部门将若干已可定案的制造图
    （设备图、配件图、耐火砖图）和施工图提前发交制造与施工部门进行制造。仅高炉焦炉方面，已有四百余张图即将发交制造及施工部门。一般土木建筑的设计，都决定采取标准图，以加速设计进程。在工作进行中，设计部门还加强了机构，改善了管理方法，重视了设计原始资料的收集工作，并开始研究一九五三年以后年度的设计任务。
    鞍山钢铁公司为了保证设计工作正确地进行，正把勘查探测工作日益提到重要地位。该公司现正建立与充实各种专业机构、各地质钻探队、地形测量队、工程地质队。供给国外设计的资料，预计于年底前可以送出；配合鞍钢内部设计的工程地质工作也正积极进行中。
    为了及时做好设备订货工作，早在七月间，鞍山钢铁公司即组织人员根据发展公司的初步设计书汇编了五年的设备订货计划及一九五三年的设备订货计划。经审核研究，现已把数以万吨计的上百种设备加以分类。其中属于国外订货的业已提出；国内部分经与有关部门多次商洽，部分订货已取得协议；自制的将随制造图的完成，陆续开始制作。估计这一工作可较一九五二年提前一季完成。材料的准备及储备工作也在紧张进行中。国外材料已提出订货，鞍山钢铁公司内部的材料储备情况已进行清查。需要国家调拨及各省、市生产的材料计划也已提出。数万立方公尺的木料即将于年前拨到，明年建设中需要的二亿多块红砖也已得到保证。
    鞍钢明年在采用工厂化及机械化施工程度上，将较今年大大提高。挖土、起重、运输、混凝土搅拌、捣固等起重工作将尽量使其机械化，预计施工机械化的程度平均将达百分之六十左右。为了进一步加强施工中的责任制，建立正规的施工管理，鞍钢对一九五三年的工程，根据主要施工对象及施工地区，划分了十二个工区，确定了各个工区的负责组成单位及人员，并确定总承包及转包的管理原则。
    鞍钢并计划将一九五三年计划内的若干可以先行施工的工程，尽量提前在第一季施工，以免重复过去每年第一季大量窝工的现象。受季节限制的工种，将集中工人加以训练，以提高工人的技术水平。同时，鞍钢固定了大量必须固定的工人，举办了临时技工学校，利用冬季加以训练。
    总结过去的经验以提高干部政治及业务水平，是改进今后工作的重要问题。鞍钢在今年第四季初即已布置基本建设部门全面总结一九五二年的经验。总结分三种：第一种是全面总结，第二种是按工程性质进行总结，第三种是专题技术总结。其中技术总结部分，有托梁换柱、托柱换脚、固定螺丝架、中心线、地下线等二十余种，由直接负责该项工作的技术人员进行总结，初稿已写出，正由苏联专家校正中。这些经验的总结，对全国其他重工业单位的建设也将起重大作用。鞍钢领导方面除动员办公室全体人员参加这一工作外，又从各业务处抽调二十余人参加这一工作。专业处也分别自己进行总结。
    为了直接向苏联专家学习，迅速地吸收苏联先进的科学技术，鞍钢基本建设部门，正组织职工学习俄文，仅各基本建设单位所举办的夜校中学习俄文的学生即达一千三百余人。
    鞍钢今年基本建设计划任务为去年实际完成的八点八倍，而明年的任务，又将为今年计划任务的两倍。面临着这样的光荣而艰巨的任务，鞍钢的职工正以兴奋而紧张的心情在积极地准备着。
