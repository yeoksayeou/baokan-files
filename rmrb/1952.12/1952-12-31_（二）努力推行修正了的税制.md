(II) Strive to Implement the Revised Tax System

The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has issued a notice regarding several revisions to the tax system and the date of implementation, and has promulgated the "Trial Measures for Commodity Circulation Tax." This is in line with the needs of China's national economic development.

The current tax laws for industry and commerce were promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government in 1950. These tax laws specifically reflected the objective reality of China during the economic recovery period. The results of their implementation over the past two and a half years have guaranteed a portion of the state's financial revenue, played a certain role in stabilizing finance and prices, promoting the recovery and development of industry and commerce, and striving for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation.

However, precisely because the current tax laws were formulated during China's economic recovery period, when the national economy had not yet been transformed, we had not yet grasped the laws governing the complex economic situation and its development changes. We could only make some reforms on the basis of the old tax system, adopting the method of "multiple taxes, multiple levies," which made the current tax system insufficiently simplified. With the development of the national economy, tax sources have constantly changed, and the current tax laws can no longer fully adapt to the new situation. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to make some revisions to the current tax system.

From the revised tax system that has now been published, it is clear that it possesses new and excellent characteristics, namely: guaranteeing tax revenue and simplifying tax payment procedures.

The method of "multiple taxes, multiple levies" that we adopted in the past in the tax system is no longer suitable for the current situation. With the recovery and development of the economy, the changes in the proportion of public and private economies, the establishment of new commercial networks, and the improvement of business methods, the laws governing commodity circulation in China's market have undergone significant changes. The main manifestations are that state-owned commerce and cooperatives have massively adopted processing, allocation, and agency purchase, agency sale, or exclusive sales methods, while private commerce tends to organize joint procurement, deep purchasing and long-distance sales, and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas is flourishing, with direct communication between production and sales. This change is an important economic progress and an inevitable result of the transformation of the old Chinese economy. In order to adapt to this change and continue to protect and cultivate tax sources, the revised tax system stipulates that the processing income tax rate is uniformly adjusted to 5%, and agency purchase, agency sale, or exclusive sales are all taxed according to the purchase and sale of goods; it also stipulates that the general branches of industry, from production, wholesale to retail, pay three levels of business tax; while the general branches of commerce pay only two levels of business tax from wholesale to retail. It can be clearly seen from these regulations that its purpose is to "protect taxes" rather than "increase taxes." It only changes the tax collection method according to the changes in industrial and commercial management methods, and does not additionally increase the burden on consumers. Of course, in the future, commodities will be fixed to pay three levels of business tax from production to retail, and some commodities will be changed to commodity circulation tax, which will slightly increase the wholesale price of some commodities in the place of production, but it will have no impact on the price in the place of sale. This basically does not increase the burden on consumers, but only makes the price scissors difference between the place of production and the place of sale tend to narrow, and makes the burden on consumers gradually tend to balance. This is reasonable and also demonstrates the superiority of the revised tax system.

The tax payment procedures stipulated in the revised tax system are more simplified than before. The stamp tax, business tax, and business tax surcharges originally payable by manufacturers will now be included in the goods tax; the stamp tax, business tax, and business tax surcharges originally payable by industrial and commercial households will now be included in the business tax; the local surcharges originally levied along with income tax will be included in the income tax; the temporary commercial tax and stamp tax originally payable by temporary businesses will be included in the temporary commercial tax; the business tax and income tax originally payable by small commercial households and vendors will be combined and calculated and paid monthly; the stamp tax, business tax, and business tax surcharges originally payable by slaughterers will be included in the slaughter tax. All of these greatly simplify tax payment procedures. As for commodities that pay commodity circulation tax, they can be sold throughout the country, and except for the separate payment of income tax, they no longer pay other taxes, nor are any surcharges levied. This further shows that the commodity circulation tax is a single tax from the production to the consumption process. It most thoroughly simplifies tax payment procedures and marks the direction of our country's development towards a new tax system. At present, because there are still five economic components coexisting in our society, and the production of small commodities still occupies a great advantage, we can only select some items from the goods tax to try out, in order to gain experience and gradually promote it. After the current tax law is merged or changed in this way, the tax rate remains basically unchanged, while the tax payment procedures are greatly simplified. It will facilitate public and private enterprises to implement economic accounting, facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and meet the needs of the country's economic development in the future.

The revised tax system continues to maintain the principle of equal tax payment for public and private enterprises. Since June of this year, in order to adjust the relationship between the public and private sectors, the People's Government has successively adopted measures such as expanding processing orders, adjusting labor costs, lowering bank loan interest rates, expanding the scope of loans to private industry and commerce, adjusting regional price differences, and adjusting wholesale and retail price differences. This revision of the tax system also reflects the equal treatment of public and private enterprises in terms of taxation. According to the notice of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the revision of the tax regulations for processing, allocation, agency purchase, agency sale, or exclusive sales will undoubtedly mainly increase the tax burden on state-owned commerce and cooperatives. At the same time, the notice also stipulates that in the future, the preferential treatment of cooperatives being exempt from income tax in the first year of establishment and a 20% reduction in business tax will be cancelled. This puts state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private businesses on a completely equal footing.

Since state-owned commerce already pays profits to the state, why must state revenue be guaranteed through taxation? Cooperatives have not been developing in China for long, and it seems that they should continue to enjoy the state's tax preferential treatment, so why is it being cancelled now? Although there is not much difference in essence between state-owned commerce paying profits to the state and paying taxes, their roles in finance are different. Because taxation can guarantee the regularity of financial revenue and the timely return of currency, which is more beneficial to finance. As for cooperatives, when they are still in the initial stage of development, it is necessary for the state to give appropriate consideration in terms of taxation, but now that the development of cooperatives has a certain foundation, it is no longer necessary to continue to give consideration. Because equal treatment in taxation for state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private businesses can, on the one hand, take care of private enterprises, and on the other hand, promote state-owned commerce and cooperatives to strive to improve management, implement economic accounting, reduce costs, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs.

We hope that the leading party and government organs at all levels will attach importance to the revised tax system, urge the tax authorities to implement it conscientiously, and instruct the relevant departments to cooperate closely. The staff of tax authorities at all levels must conscientiously study the revised tax law, conscientiously do a good job in various preparations, and conduct publicity and explanation work on the revised tax system, so that the industrial and commercial circles and the vast number of workers and shop assistants can understand the spirit of the revised tax system and tax payment procedures. Tax authorities and tax personnel must act in accordance with the law, oppose bureaucracy, and oppose coercion and commandism. Local federations of industry and commerce should also organize the entire industrial and commercial circles to study the various regulations in the notice, call on them to abide by the law and pay taxes, and fulfill their patriotic tax-paying obligations. State-owned enterprises and cooperatives should set an example and become models of abiding by the law and paying taxes. The industrial and commercial circles and workers and shop assistants must actively assist the tax authorities, strive to promote the revised tax system, so that tax work in the future can play a greater role in the country's large-scale economic construction.

### （二）努力推行修正了的税制

    （二）努力推行修正了的税制
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会颁发了关于税制若干修正及实行日期的通告，并公布了商品流通税试行办法。这是与我国国民经济发展的需要相适应的。
    我国现行工商各税的税法，是中央人民政府政务院在一九五○年公布的。这些税法具体反映了我国在经济恢复时期的客观实际。两年半以来执行的结果，它保证了国家财政的一部分收入，对稳定金融物价，对促进工商业的恢复与发展，以及对于争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转，起了一定的作用。
    但是，正因为现行的税法是在我国经济恢复时期制订的，当时国民经济还没有经过改造，我们对于复杂的经济情况及其发展变化，还没有掌握住它的规律，还只能在旧税制的基础上加以若干改革，采取了“多种税、多次征”的办法，这就使现行的税制不够简化。随着国民经济的发展，税源不断发生变化，现行税法已不能完全适应新的情况。因此，将现行税制加以若干修正，是完全必要的。
    从现在公布的修正了的税制来看，它显然具备了新的优良的特点，这就是：保证税收、简化纳税手续。
    过去我们在税制中采取的“多种税、多次征”的办法，已经不适合于现在的情况了。随着经济的恢复与发展，公私经济比重的变化，新的商业网的建立及经营方法的改善，我国市场上的商品流转规律已经起了很大的变化。主要的表现在国营商业及合作社大量采取加工、调拨及代购、代销或包销的方式，私营商业则趋向于组织联合采购、深购远销，各地城乡物资交流蓬勃发展，产销直接沟通。这种变化是经济上的重要进步，是旧中国经济改造的必然结果。为了适应于这种变化，继续保护与培养税源，修正了的税制规定，加工收益税率统一调整为百分之五，代购、代销或包销一律按进销货计税；并规定工业的总分支机构从产制、批发到零售，交纳三道营业税；商业的总分支机构，则从批发到零售只交纳两道营业税。从这些规定中可以清楚地看到，它的目的是“保税”而不是“加税”，它只是按照工商业经营方法的改变而改变征税方法，并不是另外增加消费者的负担。当然，今后的商品，从产制到零售，固定交纳三道营业税，一部分商品改征商品流通税，这将使某些商品在产地的批发价格略为提高，但它在销地的价格则并无影响。这在基本上并没有增加消费者的负担，只是使产地价格和销地价格之间的剪刀差趋于缩小，使消费者的负担逐渐趋向平衡。这是合理的，同时也表现了修正了的税制的优越性。
    修正了的税制规定的纳税手续较前更加简化了。原来厂商应纳的印花税、营业税及营业税附加，今后一律并入货物税内交纳；原来工商户应纳的印花税、营业税及营业税附加，一律并入营业税内交纳；原来随同所得税征收的地方附加，并入所得税内交纳；临时商业应纳的临时商业税及印花税，并入临时商业税内交纳；小型商业户及摊贩应纳的营业税、所得税，则合并计算，按月交纳；屠宰商应纳的印花税、营业税及营业税附加，并入屠宰税内交纳。这些都使纳税手续大为简化。至于交纳商品流通税的商品，则可行销全国，除另交所得税外，不再交纳其他各税，亦不再征收任何附加。这更表明商品流通税是一种由生产到消费过程的单一税。它最彻底地简化了纳税手续，标志着我们国家向新税制发展的方向。目前由于我国社会还有五种经济并存，小商品生产仍然占着很大优势，因此还只能从货物税中选出一部分品目来试办，以便取得经验，逐步推广。现行税法经过这样合并或改征之后，税率上基本不动，而纳税手续则大为简化。它将便利公私企业实行经济核算制，便利城乡物资交流，适合今后国家发展经济的需要。
    修正了的税制继续保持公私一律平等纳税的原则。从今年六月以来，人民政府为了调整公私关系，对私营工商业曾先后采取了扩大加工定货、调整工缴、降低银行贷款利息、扩大对私营工商业贷款范围、调整地区差价、调整批发与零售差价等措施。这次修订税制同样从税收上体现了公私企业同等待遇。依照政务院财政经济委员会通告，对于加工、调拨、代购、代销或包销课税规定的修订，毫无疑问，这将是主要地增加了国营商业及合作社的税收负担。同时，通告中又规定，今后取消合作社成立第一年免纳所得税及对合作社减征营业税百分之二十的优待。这样便使得国营商业、合作社与私商完全处在同等待遇之下。
    国营商业既已向国家交纳利润，为什么还一定要从税收上来保证国家收入呢？合作社在我国发展还不久，似乎还应该继续享受国家税收上的优待，为什么现在就取消呢？国营商业向国家交纳利润和交纳税收，虽然在本质上没有多大的区别，但在财政上的作用是不一样的。因为税收可以保证财政收入的经常性和货币的及时回笼，对财政更为有利。至于合作社，当它还在开始发展的时候，国家从税收上适当给以照顾乃是必要的，但是现在合作社的发展已有了一定的基础，继续给以照顾就不必要了。因为，对国营商业、合作社和私营商业在纳税上同等待遇，才能一方面照顾私营企业，一方面促使国营商业和合作社努力改善经营，推行经济核算制，降低成本，加速资金周转，降低流转费用。
    我们希望各级党政领导机关重视修正了的税制，督促税务机关认真加以执行，并指示有关部门予以密切配合。各级税务机关工作人员必须认真学习修订后的税法，认真做好各项准备工作，进行关于修正税制的宣传解释工作，使工商界及广大工人店员了解修正税制的精神及纳税手续。税务机关及税务工作人员要做到依法办事，反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令。各地工商联也要组织全体工商界好好学习通告中的各项规定，号召守法纳税，履行爱国纳税的义务。国营企业和合作社，更应以身作则，成为守法纳税的模范。工商界及工人店员都要积极起来，协助税务机关，努力推行修正的税制，使今后税收工作，在国家大规模经济建设中，能够发挥更大的作用。
