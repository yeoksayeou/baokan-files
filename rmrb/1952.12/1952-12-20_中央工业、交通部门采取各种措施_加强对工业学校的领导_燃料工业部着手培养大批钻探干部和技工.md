The central industrial and transportation departments are continuously strengthening their leadership over higher and secondary industrial schools to effectively train large numbers of specialized technical personnel of all levels and types, and continuously supply new forces to economic construction departments, especially the current key basic construction departments.

The three higher industrial schools under the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry (Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Engineering, Northeast Institute of Technology, and Dalian Institute of Technology) have all formulated or revised teaching plans for each major with the help of Soviet experts, and have begun to formulate or revise teaching outlines and translate Soviet textbooks. According to the types and proportions of talents needed by China's heavy industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has adjusted the secondary technical schools under its jurisdiction and formulated the professional settings for each school. In the past, the Ministry of Heavy Industry used great effort to expand and develop the work of existing industrial technical schools. From 1953 onwards, it will focus its leadership on specifically guiding the teaching work of each school and improving the quality of teaching. In late November, the Ministry convened a week-long principals' meeting for the higher and secondary industrial schools under its jurisdiction. The meeting focused on the issue of how principals should conduct leadership work, making it clear to everyone that the regular central task of the school is to improve the quality of teaching; and the important issue at present is how to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Since December 10, the Ministry has again convened the principals, academic affairs directors, and some teachers of the secondary technical schools under its jurisdiction to hold a "Meeting on the Formulation of Teaching Plans for Secondary Technical Schools." At the meeting, the teaching plans for each major will be revised or formulated based on the Soviet teaching experience and combined with the problems encountered in the actual work of each school in the past few years. This work is expected to be completed in early January 1953. The most difficult thing for the industrial schools under the Ministry of Heavy Industry at present is the lack of teaching materials. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Ministry has concentrated all possible forces to translate a large number of Soviet textbooks, and can translate and publish 50 kinds before the end of this year. In order to better learn from the Soviet experience, the Industrial Education Department of the Ministry has decided to rotate all educational work cadres and principals and teachers of various industrial schools to study Russian at the Russian Language Training School run by the Ministry itself. In addition, the work of expanding and developing existing industrial technical schools will continue next year. In 1953, eight new secondary technical schools for geology, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, iron and steel, surveying and mapping, and building materials will be built.

The Ministry of Fuel Industry is studying how to strengthen the educational leadership organization and improve efficiency under the new situation of the adjustment of the Greater Administrative Region institutions and the expansion of the scope of work of the various professional general bureaus, so as to better complete the task of training and training cadres. From next year, political counseling offices will be established in the colleges and universities under the leadership of the Ministry of Fuel Industry to strengthen the political and ideological education of students. In order to meet the urgent needs of the current basic construction, the Ministry is rapidly training a large number of drilling technical talents. According to the decision of the Coal Industry Basic Construction Conference of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, in 1953, the Ministry will train and cultivate 2,169 senior and intermediate drilling technical cadres and 6,315 technicians in major administrative regions, including engineers and technicians in geology, drilling, electrical engineering, surveying, and chemical testing, as well as core recorders, drillers, electricians, surveyors, diesel engine drivers, and automobile drivers. At the beginning of December, the Ministry of Fuel Industry had already allocated the first batch of training fees of 30 billion yuan. At present, the Kailuan and Jiaozuo Drilling Cadre Schools directly led by the Ministry of Fuel Industry have officially started classes. The Kailuan Drilling Cadre School opened on October 31. Before the end of this year, all classroom learning can be completed, and students will be assigned to field internships. The school's plan for next year is to train 1,000 drilling cadres, scheduled to start on January 15. The 800 students of the Jiaozuo Drilling Cadre School have started classes in three shifts one after another. According to the teaching plan, all of them will graduate in about half a year. Drilling schools in major administrative regions are also actively preparing. In addition to transferring responsible cadres to prepare for the school, the Central and Southern District has also determined the list of cadres and technicians to be sent to other districts for training. The first batch of 90 students of the Drilling Technician Training Class jointly run by North China and East China in Huainan have graduated and have already participated in the work.

The three higher technical schools under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways—Beijing Railway Institute, Tangshan Railway Institute, and Harbin Railway Institute—completed the adjustment of departments in September this year. All three institutes transferred out departments such as mining, metallurgy, construction, and chemical industry, and set up specialties. Beijing Railway Institute specializes in training personnel for train operations, commerce, and railway economy; Tangshan Railway Institute specializes in training personnel for civil engineering, machinery, and electric power transportation; Harbin Railway Institute specializes in training personnel for telecommunications, signaling, and Russian translation. The three institutes were originally under the jurisdiction of Northern Jiaotong University and the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways, but have now been changed to independent institutes directly led by the Ministry of Railways. In order to quickly cultivate new forces in railway basic construction, the three institutes have set up various majors and expanded specialized courses in accordance with the central policy of "combining long-term training with short-term quick training." Tangshan Railway Institute enrolled 900 new students last year, of which 600 entered specialized courses; in the enrollment of the three institutes in 1953, the proportion of new students in specialized courses will account for 70%. The railway management agencies of old China have always not paid attention to the training of secondary technical personnel. In addition to temporary training courses, apprentice training centers, or short-term training classes, there was not a single regular secondary technical school. In the past three years, the Ministry of Railways has established twelve regular secondary technical schools and eight technical schools. In the past three years, secondary technical schools in the railway sector have held various specialized classes and quick training classes in a quick way, and have trained more than 5,000 secondary technical personnel and technicians in conjunction with regular classes, all of whom have participated in on-site work. Next year, in addition to expanding the existing secondary technical schools, the Ministry of Railways will also set up a new driver school. In addition, the three railway institutes in Beijing, Tangshan, and Harbin plan to establish workers' quick middle schools from next year to recruit labor models, activists, and revolutionary cadres from among the workers. After graduation, they will be promoted to specialized courses. It is expected that in three to five years, a group of engineers from the working class will appear in the railway system.

The educational leadership organization of the Ministry of Communications is being strengthened. The original Education Department has been expanded into the Education Division since November, and cadres are being allocated in accordance with the establishment. The three higher education institutions directly led by the Ministry of Communications—Northeast Maritime College, Shanghai Maritime College, and Wuhan River Transportation College—have all determined their professional settings. Wuhan River Transportation College (formerly known as Jiaotong College) originally had a wide variety of departments and different academic systems. There were departments such as automobile engineering, highway engineering, shipping, and marine engineering, as well as intermediate-level departments such as highway transportation and surveying and mapping. The academic system varied from one year, two years, and four and a half years, which was extremely inconsistent. Now it has clearly stipulated the training policy of "facing inland rivers" and specializes in training senior professional technical cadres needed for inland rivers. The college has now set up two majors: ship machinery and mechanics, and river transportation management; it plans to add two majors next year: waterways and ports, and port machinery and equipment and management. Northeast Maritime College has set up five majors: ship driving, ship power plant, ship repair, maritime management, and waterways and ports. In terms of secondary technical schools, in addition to the expansion of the Northwest, Southwest, East China, Northeast, and North China Transportation Schools and the Northeast River Transportation School, a new transportation school will be established in Central South China.

    中央工业、交通部门采取各种措施
    加强对工业学校的领导
    燃料工业部着手培养大批钻探干部和技工
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部、燃料工业部、铁道部和交通部正不断加强对高等和中等工业学校的领导，以期有效地大量培养各级各类的专门技术人材，源源向经济建设部门特别是当前的重点基本建设部门输送新生力量。
    中央人民政府重工业部领导的三个高等工业学校（北京钢铁学院、东北工学院、大连工学院），都已在苏联专家的帮助下，制订或修订了各专业的教学计划，并着手制订或修订教学大纲，翻译苏联教材。根据我国重工业需要的人材的类别和比重，重工业部对所属的中等技术学校作了调整，拟订了各校的专业设置。过去，重工业部曾用很大的力量进行了扩充和发展原有工业技术学校的工作，一九五三年起，将把领导力量主要地放在具体指导各校的教学工作、提高教学质量上面。该部在十一月下旬召集所属各高等和中等工业学校的校长，举行了为时一周的校长会议。会议着重研究了校长如何进行领导工作的问题，使大家明确地认识了：学校经常的中心工作，是提高教学质量；当前的重要问题，是如何学习苏联的先进经验。自十二月十日起，该部又召集属的各中等技术学校的校长、教务主任和一部分教员，举行“中等技术学校制订教学计划会议”，会上将根据苏联的教学经验，结合各校过去几年在实际工作中遇到的问题，重新修订或制订各专业的教学计划。这个工作预计可在一九五三年一月初完成。重工业部所属各工业学校当前最感困难的是教材缺乏。为了克服这一困难，该部集中了所有可能集中的力量，大量翻译苏联教材，今年年底以前可以翻译出版五十种。为了更好地学习苏联经验，该部工业教育司已决定将所有的教育工作干部和各工业学校的校长、教师，轮流调到该部自办的俄文专修学校学习俄文。此外，扩充和发展现有工业技术学校的工作，明年仍将继续进行。一九五三年将新建地质、有色金属、化学、钢铁、测绘、建筑材料等八个中等技术学校。
    中央人民政府燃料工业部在大行政区机构调整及各专业总局工作范围扩大的新情况下，正研究如何加强教育领导机构，提高效率，以便更好地完成培养和训练干部的任务。明年起，燃料工业部领导的各院校将建立政治辅导处，加强对于学生的政治思想教育。为了满足当前基本建设的迫切需要，该部正以速成的方法大批培养钻探技术人材。根据燃料工业部煤业基本建设会议的决定，一九五三年内，该部将在各大行政区训练和培养高级、中级钻探技术干部二千一百六十九人，技工六千三百一十五人，其中包括地质、钻探、电机、测量、化验等工程师和技术员、岩心记录员、钻工、电机工、测工、柴油机司机及汽车司机等多方面的人材。十二月初，燃料工业部已将第一批训练费三百亿元拨下。目前，燃料工业部直接领导的开滦和焦作两个钻探干部学校都已正式开课。开滦钻探干部学校在十月三十一日开学，今年年底以前，课堂学习可以全部完毕，并将分配学员至现场实习。该校明年的计划是培养钻探干部一千人，预定一月十五日开学。焦作钻探干部学校的八百名学员已分三班先后上课，根据教学计划，约在半年后可全部毕业。各大行政区的钻探学校也正积极筹办中。中南区除已调负责干部进行学校的筹备工作外，并已确定了送外区培养的干部和技工的名单。华北、华东两区在淮南合办的钻探技工训练班，第一批学员九十名已经毕业，并已参加工作。
    中央人民政府铁道部领导的三个高等技术学校——北京铁道学院、唐山铁道学院和哈尔滨铁道学院，已在今年九月间完成了院系调整工作。三院都将采矿、冶金、建筑、化工等系调整出去，设置了专业。北京铁道学院专门培养车务、商务和铁路经济人材；唐山铁道学院专门培养土木、机械和电力运输人材；哈尔滨铁道学院专门培养电讯、号志和俄文翻译人材。三院原分属北方交通大学和铁道部东北特派员办事处，现已改为独立学院，由铁道部直接领导。为了迅速培养铁道基本建设方面的新生力量，三院按照中央“长期培养与短期速成相结合”的方针，分设了各种专业，扩充了专修科。唐山铁道学院去年招收新生九百名，其中六百名进入专修科；一九五三年三院招生，专修科新生的比重将占百分之七十。旧中国的铁路管理机构向来不重视中等技术人员的培养，除了临时性的见习所、艺徒养成所或短期训练班外，没有一所正规的中等技术学校。中央人民政府铁道部在过去三年中创办了十二所正规化的中等技术学校和八个技工学校。三年来，铁路方面的中等技术学校曾以速成的方法举办了各种专修班、速成班，配合着正规班培养了五千多名中等技术人员和技工，他们都已参加现场工作。明年，铁道部除扩充现有中等技术学校外，并将新设司机学校一所。此外，北京、唐山、哈尔滨三个铁道学院计划自明年起创办工人速成中学，吸收工人中的劳动模范、积极分子和革命干部入学。他们毕业以后便升入专修科。预计三、五年以后铁路系统即将出现一批工人出身的工程师。
    中央人民政府交通部的教育领导机构正在加强。原有的教育处，自十一月起已扩大为教育司，目前正按照编制调配干部。交通部直接领导的三个高等学校——东北航海学院、上海航务学院和武汉河运学院，都已确定了专业设置。武汉河运学院（原名交通学院），原有系科庞杂，学制不一，有自动车系、公路工程、航运、轮机等系，也有中级性的公路运输、测绘等系，学制有一年的、两年的、四年半的，极不一致，现已明确规定了“面向内河”的培养方针，专门培养内河所需高级专业技术干部。该院现已设置了船舶机器与机械、河运管理两个专业；明年拟增设水道与港口、港口机械设备及管理两专业。东北航海学院设置了船舶驾驶、船舶动力装置、船舶修理、海运管理、水道与港口五个专业。中等技术学校方面，除西北、西南、华东、东北、华北各交通学校及东北河运学校已有扩充外，并将在中南新设一所交通学校。
