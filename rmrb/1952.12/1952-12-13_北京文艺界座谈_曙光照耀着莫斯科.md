Beijing literary and art circles held a symposium on "Dawn Over Moscow"

The Northeast People's Art Theater's performance of the famous Soviet play "Dawn Over Moscow" in Beijing for the past two weeks has had a great educational effect on the audience. The All-China Dramatists Association, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, the Beijing People's Art Theater, and the Beijing Cultural Affairs Bureau held a get-together on the afternoon of December 9th to welcome comrades from the Northeast People's Art Theater. At the meeting, they also discussed issues related to drama creation and performance. The director of the play, Yan Zheng, and the main actors attended the meeting. Chairman Tian Han pointed out that the play is full of revolutionary optimism and allows people to see the dawn of communism. Whether in writing about positive characters or in terms of stage art, it has given Chinese audiences and drama workers great inspiration. The Northeast was liberated earlier and is the key location for our country's industrial construction. The Northeast's drama work often gives us new feelings. The performance of "Before the New Things" a few years ago and this performance of "Dawn Over Moscow" are examples.

Then, Lao She, Hong Shen, Cao Yu, Yang Hansheng, Zhang Geng, Zhong Dianfei, Sun Weishi, Ouyang Shanzun, Wu Zuguang and others spoke. Lao She said: Although this play is about the issue of printed cloth, it is not about how to weave printed cloth, but about the thinking of people moving towards a communist society. After watching this play, we realized that when we write scripts about the "Five Antis" campaign, we cannot only write about how workers fight tigers and check accounts, but we must investigate the crimes and thoughts of illegal capitalists. After experiencing life in factories, when we write plays about production, we often like to write more and more about machines, but we lack life and character. We don't write much about positive characters, and we don't write them well; when we write about Communist Party members, we only let them appear solemnly when solving problems. However, Sulov, the author of "Dawn Over Moscow," integrates the life of the Party Secretary into everyone's life. For example, when writing about a mayor, even if he is originally a composed person who can solve problems with jokes, we often think that the mayor can only come out during ribbon-cutting ceremonies because we don't understand his life. We also see from this play that the purpose of writing about the shortcomings of a positive character is to correct his or her shortcomings so that he or she can build the motherland better.

Hong Shen did not watch the entire performance, so his speech was shorter. He pointed out that the play was too long and some parts were too protracted. He said that the Beijing masses' welcome of it was not accidental. It educated the audience and was even more helpful to comrades leading production enterprises.

Cao Yu believed that the performance of this play illustrated the correctness of the Northeast drama movement's direction. He said that this play richly depicted life and was not thin at all. When we write about a production model, we often first think about writing about his tricks, thus isolating his technique. In the performance, some parts were a bit too long, such as the picnic scene, which could be shortened.

Yang Hansheng said: We can see from this play a good example of realistic creation methods. The Party Secretary is an outstanding image. When we write about leading figures in dramas, we often don't use much ink, fearing that we will distort the image. Therefore, the leading figures we write are often like paper figures, without flesh and blood, without life. But Kurepin has strong principles and fights firmly, but he loves children, likes to fish, and is also humorous. From this play, we see the Soviet people moving from socialism to communism, fighting with full enthusiasm against obstacles in their path. The old mother in the play is a lovely character, but she is behind her daughter in preventing her daughter from making a public self-criticism. By writing this point, the personalities of the two characters are highlighted, which is real.

Zhang Geng felt that after watching "Dawn Over Moscow," this play could stimulate our spoken drama movement to flourish again. The way this play writes about the shortcomings of positive characters is very reasonable, and it also writes about the Bolsheviks' excellent qualities of accepting criticism and correcting mistakes, which greatly inspires our playwrights.

Zhong Dianfei believed that past spoken drama works did not reflect a rich enough life. When we write about positive characters, we should pay attention to writing about what attitude he takes towards the people's problems and difficulties. The Kurepin in the play is a good example. He loves what the people love. It doesn't matter where he appears or how long he appears; the question is how he cares about the people. It is not necessary to stipulate whether positive characters have mistakes; it depends on whether it is possible for mistakes to occur. Our playwrights must clarify the contradictions in real life, the people's love and demands, so that the works written will be welcomed by the people.

Sun Weishi also said that the script was well-chosen. The characters in the play are so passionate about life and love life. The potential of our spoken drama has not yet been fully realized. This play encourages us to study hard and use our abilities more. In terms of stage art, the use of windows in the play is repetitive, and the atmosphere of the collective farm in the scene depicting the collective farm is not enough. Apart from these minor flaws, this performance achieved the purpose of expressing the theme.

Ouyang Shanzun and others had seen the performance of "Dawn Over Moscow" in the Soviet Union and provided references for certain occasions and details.

Wu Zuguang realized that this play focuses on one point and involves many aspects; the transformation of the commissioner and chief engineer of the Ministry of Textile Industry is omitted because it is not the focus, which is very clean.

### 北京文艺界座谈“曙光照耀着莫斯科”

    北京文艺界座谈“曙光照耀着莫斯科”
    东北人民艺术剧院两周来在京公演苏联名剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”，对观众起了很大的教育作用。中华全国戏剧工作者协会、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会、北京市人民艺术剧院、北京市文化事业管理处于十二月九日下午举行联欢会，欢迎东北人民艺术剧院的同志们，会上并座谈了有关戏剧创作和演出的问题。该剧导演严正及主要演员均到会。主席田汉指出该剧充满了革命的乐观主义精神，使人们看到了共产主义的曙光。无论在怎样写正面人物的问题上，或在舞台艺术方面，都给中国观众及戏剧工作者很大启发。东北解放较早，又是我国的工业建设重点所在地，东北的戏剧工作常常给我们新的感觉。年前“在新事物的面前”的演出和这次“曙光照耀着莫斯科”的演出，都是例证。
    接着有老舍、洪深、曹禺、阳翰笙、张庚、钟惦棐、孙维世、欧阳山尊、吴祖光等人发言。老舍说：这个戏虽然写的是花布问题，但不是写花布如何织法，而是写走向共产主义社会的人们的思想。看了这个戏，我们领会到：我们写“五反”的剧本，不能只写工人们如何打老虎如何查账，要查的是不法资本家们的罪行和思想。我们在下厂体验生活以后，写一些有关生产的戏，往往喜欢越多写机器越好，但缺少生活，缺少人物性格。我们写正面人物，写不多，也写不好；写共产党员，只在解决问题时才让他庄重地出来一下。而“曙光照耀着莫斯科”的作者苏洛夫，却把党委书记的生活搀到大家的生活里去。又如写一位市长，即使本来是一位态度从容、说着笑话也能解决问题的人物，但是我们因为不了解他的生活，往往以为只有在剪彩的时候，市长才能出来。我们从这个戏里又看出：写一个正面人物的缺点，目的是为了纠正他或她的缺点，使他或她可以把祖国建设得更好。
    洪深没有把演出看完全，所以发言较短。他指出戏的演出太长，有些地方太拖沓。他说北京群众对它的欢迎不是偶然的，它教育了观众，对一些领导生产企业的同志，更有帮助。
    曹禺认为这个戏的演出说明了东北戏剧运动方向的正确。他说这个戏丰满地写出了生活，一点也不单薄。我们写一个生产模范，往往首先想写他的窍门，这样就孤立地去写他的技术了。在演出中，有些地方是太长了一点，例如郊游一场就可以缩短。
    阳翰笙说：从这个戏可以看出现实主义创作方法的好榜样。党委书记是个出色的形象。我们在戏剧中写领导人物，往往落墨不多，怕歪曲了形象，因此写出来的领导人物往往如同纸扎的人，没有血肉，没有生活。而库列聘呢，他原则性强，坚定地斗争，但是他热爱孩子，喜欢钓鱼，也很幽默。从这个戏里，我们看到从社会主义走向共产主义的苏联人民在满腔热情地与前进中的障碍斗争。剧中的老母亲是个可爱的人物，但是在她阻止女儿当众检讨这一点上，她又比女儿落后了。写进了这一点，两个人物的性格便突现出来了，这是真实的。
    张庚看了“曙光照耀着莫斯科”以后，觉得这个剧可以刺激我们的话剧运动再度蓬勃起来。这个戏里写正面人物的缺点，写得很合乎道理，同时也写出了布尔什维克的接受批评、改正错误的优良品质，这给我们的剧作者很大启发。
    钟惦棐认为过去某些话剧作品反映的生活不丰富。我们写正面人物，要注意写出他对人民的问题和困难采取什么态度。剧中的库列聘是一个好例子，他喜爱人民所喜爱的东西。他在什么场合出现，出现多久，是无关紧要的；问题在于他怎样关心人民。倒不必规定正面人物有没有错误，要看可能不可能产生错误。我们的剧作者要弄清楚现实生活中的矛盾，人民的喜爱和要求，这样写出来的作品才会受到人民的欢迎。
    孙维世也说这个剧本选择得好。剧中人物是那么热爱生活、热爱生命。我们的话剧潜在能力还没有发挥出来，这个戏鼓励我们好好学习，把能力多多使用。在舞台艺术上，剧中使用窗户的地方重复，表现集体农庄的一场，集体农庄的气氛不够。除了这些小毛病，这次演出达到了表达主题思想的目的。
    欧阳山尊等在苏联看过“曙光照耀着莫斯科”的演出，对某些场合与细节，提供了参考意见。
    吴祖光体会到：这个戏集中一点，又牵涉到很多方面；对纺织工业部的专员和总工程师的转变略而不写，因为并非重点，这样写十分干净。
