For the past two years, due to our insufficient understanding of the political and economic significance of design work, lack of scientific design methods, and insufficient responsibility for national construction, we have made many mistakes and detours in our design work. We started designing several important projects in 1950, but have not produced final results by the end of this autumn, and have not even completed the necessary data preparation. Many projects were blindly constructed in a hurry, causing huge waste to the country, prolonging construction time, and seriously affecting continuous production and expanded reproduction. For example, in the deep construction of a certain mine, 18% of the design work had been completed during the puppet Manchukuo period. After liberation, we blindly followed the original plan without comprehensively reviewing whether the engineering design was reasonable, resulting in huge losses. In May 1950, a deep design committee was formally established to start the design, but to this day, not only has a final and reasonable plan not been determined, but even the basic geological data of the mine—the reserves—has not been clearly surveyed. The deep construction of another mine began in November 1950, when the design committee was established. It has been two years now, and we have not only failed to treat it as a whole construction and make an overall design, but even the basic principles of the western partial project have only recently been revised; during this period, we were also impatient to start construction, causing losses to the country. In particular, there were two pre-imagined lines of deep coal reserves in this mine during the puppet Manchukuo period, but to this day we have not drilled a new hole to find out the truth.

The design of the open-pit mine started in June 1950, and has not reached a correct conclusion to this day. We are currently considering designing according to the advanced technology of the new Soviet-designed open-pit mine, which can extend the mining life of the open-pit mine by more than one time, and can fully supply all the oil shale needs. However, because the original data that serves as the premise of the design, such as the nature of various rocks and the possibility of collapse of the north and south sides of the open pit, as well as hydrological conditions, have not been accurately grasped, it is actually impossible to do so immediately. These facts all show that our irresponsible work has delayed the construction time of these important mines.

In terms of factory expansion construction and civil engineering projects, there are also phenomena of inadequate design and even construction without design. For example, a factory has built some houses on the open space in the south of the factory in the past few years based only on temporary needs without any planning; when the state put forward the task of expanding the factory, that place could not be used and hindered the overall design. Another factory has a large site and could have been expanded into a very ideal factory, but due to the above reasons, it caused design difficulties: if the workshops are arranged according to reasonable principles, there will be no north-south road that can be directly connected; in order to build the main road, even if some concessions are made, some of the newly built houses have to be demolished. As for design technology, there are even more loopholes. For example, the best club built by a factory for the whole bureau was designed and constructed at the same time. After more than half a year of construction, people are still not allowed to go upstairs; because the structure has problems, they are afraid of collapse. The forging factory of a factory has been moved several times. When it was finally completed, experts believed that the factory could not install air hammers at all. The club of a mine has been built halfway and has to be recalculated and designed. The above are only part of the shortcomings and errors in our design work, and there are many more such situations.

Summarizing the above situation, it can be said that the most important gains we have made in design work in the past few years are some experiences and lessons. These experiences and lessons are:

First, we must change the wrong idea of neglecting design and data preparation. We have deeply realized that construction cannot be carried out without a correct design, and a correct design must be based on thorough resource exploration and other original data, otherwise it will cause irreparable losses to the country. This has been fully proved in the above examples. How should we accept this painful lesson? We believe that the primary problem is to strengthen the leadership of design and data preparation work. Especially for some larger projects, not only should the bureau's leading cadres seriously study and put forward clear design principles and policies, but also the major issues should be formally submitted to higher authorities for decision and consulted with Soviet experts. At the same time, it is necessary to immediately organize forces to carry out large-scale and systematic resource exploration and preparation of all other design data; we must educate all staff to correct the wrong view of neglecting design and other data preparation work.

Second, we must consider the rationality of a design from many aspects. Engineering design is a comprehensive product of politics, economy, and technology, and it is a work with a high degree of ideology and science. Therefore, we must consider it from many aspects to make each design politically correct, economically reasonable, and technologically advanced. In order to correctly select the most reasonable design scheme, any engineering design must propose several schemes as much as possible, specifically calculate its direct investment, long-term operation and management investment, and the length of the construction period, etc., and analyze, compare, and select from them; it must not be simplified. It is precisely because we have not done this in the past that we have caused great losses to the country.

Take the deep construction of a factory as an example. At first, we selected six or seven plans, but we could not get rid of the constraints of the existing savings in equipment foundations, and we excessively accommodated the original foundations, so that the design plan could not be decided for a long time. Later, after a comprehensive calculation and comparison, we clearly saw the advantages and disadvantages of the three basic plans: the original inclined shaft plan, although the construction period can be shortened and the current direct investment can be reduced due to the completed partial projects, the long-term management fee in the future is surprisingly huge; the new vertical shaft plan, although the construction period is long and the investment amount is large, the future management fee is very small; the combined plan of inclined shaft and vertical shaft (that is, using the original inclined shaft to excavate a vertical shaft tube), except that the construction period is the same as that of the vertical shaft, the other is between the two. Obviously, in terms of the degree of technological advancement and the amount of permanent management fees, the vertical shaft is good, the inclined shaft is not good, and the combined plan of the two can also be discarded. This experience tells us that for major projects that determine long-term interests, we should adopt a more thorough reform plan as much as possible, and we must not adopt a reformist approach.

Another example is the design of a certain factory to renovate a certain equipment by itself. Originally, there was only one plan, and all the technical design had been done, with a budget investment of 12.8 billion yuan; after review by the bureau and the ministry, it was proposed to modify it, and the budget investment was reduced to 6.9 billion yuan; after further research, it was found that an investment of only 5 billion yuan was enough, and the construction was relatively simple. If the first plan is followed, not only will it cost more than 7 billion yuan, but also the electrical dust removal equipment, which is directly related to the labor protection of workers, will have to be dismantled. It can be seen that the same project can find several different schemes with significant differences in political impact, economic value, and investment effect due to the different degrees of research by the designers.

These facts teach us that people's understanding is gradually deepening; but in order to avoid detours, we should boldly raise the problem comprehensively from the beginning, and we must not look at the problem one-sidedly or have preconceived ideas. For any engineering design, we should propose as many schemes as possible. This should be a principle. Otherwise, it is equivalent to canceling the possibility of comparison and selection; even if it is decided, it may be one-sided.

Third, we must adhere to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, thoroughly criticize the corrupt old technical views, and oppose the conservative views that are divorced from reality. According to our inspection, the root cause of the errors in the past design is that we blindly believe in the old technology and have a very poor attitude towards learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, last year, Soviet coal preparation experts told us that we must analyze the coal quality of the western part of a mine in order to determine its coking performance. However, we did not do it at all, which made the engineering design stay in a backward state for a long time. Not only can we not accept the advanced quotas of the Soviet Union, but it is also much worse than the quotas already created by the workers on site. For example, the annual mining capacity of the open-pit electric shovel, the actual capacity on site has exceeded two-thirds of the design. The designed daily output of the 80-meter yard in the western project of a mine is 300 tons, but in fact some mines have reached a daily output of 500 to 700 tons. Also, in the design of roadway construction, we dare not boldly adopt new cross-sections and molded cement bricks; in civil construction, we dare not boldly adopt prefabricated reinforced concrete floor slabs; in the power distribution design for technical schools, according to Soviet experience, 200 kVA is enough; but we designed according to British and American standards, using 500 kVA. All of this shows that our design thinking is conservative and backward.

In order to accept these lessons, we must first establish the view of firmly trusting Soviet technology and experience, and learn from Soviet experts with the greatest enthusiasm and humility. We must earnestly organize the study of the Soviet "Foreign Design Book" and systematically collect and learn from Soviet design experience from relevant agencies. We must organize design personnel to earnestly learn Russian as a bridge to learn from Soviet experience. Secondly, in the design, we must attach importance to the advanced experience created by the workers on site and adopt it in the design; we must report our design to skilled technicians, mobilize them to discuss and put forward amendments; we must personally go to the site to inspect and verify the authenticity of the design data we have obtained.

Fourth, correctly making and strictly reviewing the preliminary design is the key to saving investment. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the savings in the design work itself, and the requirements for basic construction investment and design were as large and as much as possible, which caused great waste. It was not until this year that there was a preliminary change. In the design of basic construction projects in 1952, because we attached importance to savings, attached importance to the adoption of advanced Soviet experience, and attached importance to review work, we saved 6.2% of the planned investment and completed 123% of the savings task given by the bureau, and completed 120% of our own struggle goal.

According to our experience, the key to saving on design at present often lies in whether the selection of design principles is correct. Therefore, the current savings on design should first strengthen the review of the preliminary design principle scheme, and secondly should be the savings in technical design. On the other hand, we should not only pay attention to the savings in direct investment, but also pay attention to the savings in long-term management costs in the design scheme. If we save a small amount of direct investment but increase a large amount of long-term management costs in the future, it is obviously uneconomical.

Fifth, in order to improve the efficiency of design work, we must implement special responsible leadership for design projects; in order to ensure the technological advancement of design, we must implement specialized training for design personnel. We have not done enough in this regard in the past. Before the establishment of the Design Office, although there were several design committees, people were temporarily assembled, the organization was not sound, and there was no specialization and long-term training; the same coal mining design was not unified. As a result, not only was the work efficiency low, but it often caused errors. After November last year, although the Design Office was established, because it was pieced together by various related design departments, and it lacked experience, in the first half of the 1952 design, it adopted the organizational form of dividing into sections and groups according to technical nature. In this way, basic technology can be unifiedly managed and exchange experience, but important projects still have no special responsibility, and each department is disconnected in the same project, and the efficiency is still very low. According to past experience, in the future, we should: (1) allocate manpower according to the principle of focusing on completing the design tasks of the country's major projects, and designate special project leaders; (2) the design tasks of more than one project of the same nature can be assigned to a design group with a special nature, designated by the chief engineer to lead, so as to ensure continuous continuous cyclic flow operation; (3) in the design group of the same nature, professional division of labor should be implemented according to technical nature (such as civil construction, machinery, electrical mining, etc.) to make them more proficient in the business; (4) special professional designs commonly needed by each group (such as water and heating, power transmission, substation, etc.), set up a special professional group, and accept the local tasks in the special responsible projects of each group in the form of internal entrustment; (5) all tasks of each group should be issued through formal procedures (such as task confirmation notice, etc.); (6) boldly train talents, and do not rely on and wait. The above points, after our preliminary implementation, we feel that it is a better management system within the design department. We believe that this should be done in both enterprise-based and non-enterprise-based design departments; especially when there is a shortage of personnel, it is even more necessary to do so. For departments that have not been fully enterprise-based, it is best to set up a special agency to manage the self-made designs of factories and mines below the limit, so as to strengthen the review and management of the designs of factories and mines under the bureau; on the other hand, it specializes in handling general domestic commissioned designs.

    必须以对国家的负责精神和科学态度来改进我们的设计工作
    ——抚顺矿务局设计工作的经验教训
    抚顺矿务局设计处
    两年来，由于我们对设计工作的政治、经济意义认识不足，缺乏科学的设计方法，对国家的基本建设不够负责，我们在设计工作中犯了许多错误，走了许多弯路。我们自一九五零年即开始做几项重要工程的设计工作，但直到今年秋末还没有做出最后结果，甚至连必需的资料准备工作也没做好。有许多工程为了急于建设，就盲目施工，给国家造成巨大浪费，拖长了建设的时间，使连续生产和扩大再生产受到了严重的影响。譬如某矿深部建设，伪满时已完成设计工作量的百分之十八，解放后我们没有全面审查这个工程设计是否合理，就盲目地照原案施工，结果造成巨大损失。一九五零年五月，正式成立了深部设计委员会开始设计，但直到今天，不仅还没有确定一个最后的合理方案，而且连该矿的基本地质资料——埋藏量都没有勘察清楚。另一个矿的深部建设，从一九五零年十一月成立设计委员会，到现在已两年，我们不仅没有把它看作是整体建设，作出整体设计来，就是西部局部工程也才于最近修整了基本原则方案；在这期间又急躁施工，给国家造成了损失。尤其是该矿深部煤的埋藏预想线，在伪满时就有两条，但直到今天我们仍然没有打一个新钻孔去查知究竟。
    露天矿的设计，从一九五零年六月开始，到今天还没有得出正确结论。目前我们又在考虑按照苏联新设计的露天矿先进技术进行设计，这样可以延长露天矿的开采寿命一倍以上，而且可以充分供应全部油母页岩的需要。但是因为对作为设计的前提的原始资料，如露天南北二帮各种岩石性质与崩落的可能性，以及水文情况等，都还没有确实掌握，以致实际上不可能立刻这样做。这些事实都说明了由于我们工作不负责任，拖延了这些重要矿井的建设时间。
    在工厂的扩大建设及土木建筑工程方面，同样地存在着设计不周，甚至没有设计就施工的现象。如某厂几年来仅根据一时的需要，毫无计划地在厂的南部空地上盖了一些房子；当国家对该厂提出扩大建设的任务时，那块地方就不能利用，妨碍了整体设计。又如另一个工厂厂址很大，本可以扩大建设成一个很理想的工厂，但也因上述原因造成设计上的困难：假如按照合理的原则布置车间，那里就没有一条可以直通的南北大路；为了修大路，即使迁就一些，也得把新盖的房子拆除一部分。至于设计技术方面，更是漏洞百出。如某厂修筑的一个全局最好的俱乐部，一面设计一面施工，修了半年多，楼上还不准上人；因为结构有毛病，怕塌。某厂的锻造厂移动了几次，最后修成时，经专家研究，认为这个厂根本不能安装气锤。某矿的俱乐部已修了半截又要重新计算、设计。以上所述，还只是我们设计工作中存在的缺点与错误的一部分，像这样的情况还很多。
    总括上面的情况，可以说，几年来我们在设计工作中最主要的收获就是取得了一些经验教训。这些经验教训是：
    第一、必须改变忽视设计及资料准备工作的错误思想。我们深刻地认识了：没有正确的设计就不能施工，而正确的设计又必须有周密的资源勘察以及其他原始资料为前提，否则就会给国家造成不可弥补的损失。这在上述事例中已充分得到证明。应该怎样接受这个沉痛的教训呢？我们认为：首要问题就是要加强对设计及资料准备工作的领导。特别是一些较大的工程，不但局的领导干部应认真研究，提出明确的设计原则与方针，而且应该把重大的问题正式提交上级决定和向苏联专家请教。同时，需要立即组织力量，进行大规模的、有系统的资源勘察以及其他一切设计资料的准备工作；要教育全体工作人员纠正忽视设计及其他资料准备工作的错误观点。
    第二、必须从多方面考虑一个设计的合理性。工程设计是政治、经济、技术三方面的综合产物，是有高度思想性与科学性的工作。因此设计时必须从多方面考虑，使每项设计在政治上正确、经济上合理、技术上先进。为要正确地选择出一个最合理的设计方案，任何一个工程设计都必须尽可能地提出几种方案，具体计算它的直接投资，长期经营管理投资，以及施工期长短等等，从中进行分析、比较和选择；决不能简单化。正是由于过去我们没有这样做，所以给国家造成了极大的损失。
    就以某厂的深部建设来说吧。我们起先选出了六七个方案，但是始终摆脱不开眼前看到的、节省设备基础的束缚，过分迁就了原有基础，以致设计方案迟迟不能决定。后来做了全面的计算与比较之后，我们在三个基本方案中，很清楚地看出了它们的优劣：原来的斜井方案，虽因有竣工的部分工程，可以缩短工期，减少现在的直接投资，但是将来长期的管理费却是惊人的庞大；新的竖井方案，虽然施工期长，投资额大，但将来的管理费却非常小；斜井与竖井结合方案（即利用原斜井开凿一竖井筒），除施工期与竖井相同外，其他均在两者之间。显然，从技术先进程度与永久管理费多少上看，是竖井好，斜井不好，二者相结合的方案也可不用。这一经验告诉我们，对于一种决定长远利益的重大工程应尽可能地采取比较彻底的改革方案，切不可采取改良主义的办法。
    又如某厂自做的改建某种设备的设计，原来只有一种方案，而且已做了全部技术设计，预算投资一百二十八亿元；经过局及部的审核，提出修改，预算投资减为六十九亿；后经再次研究，只要投资五十亿元就够了，而且施工还比较简便。如按第一个方案做，不但要多投资七十多亿元，而且要拆除与工人劳动保护直接有关的电气除尘室设备。可见同
    一个工程，因设计人员钻研程度不同，就可以找出在政治影响、经济价值与投资效果方面都有显著差别的几种不同的方案。
    这些事实给我们的教训是：人的认识是逐步深入的；但为了避免走弯路，一开始就应该大胆地把问题全面提出来，切不可片面地看问题，或怀有成见。对于任何一个工程设计，都应尽可能地多提出
    一些方案。这应该是一个原则。否则，就等于取消了比较与选择的可能；即使决定了，也可能失之片面。
    第三、必须坚持学习苏联先进经验，彻底批判腐朽的旧技术观点，反对脱离实际的保守观点。根据我们检查，造成过去设计中的错误的根本原因，是我们盲目相信旧的技术，虚心学习苏联先进经验很差。如去年苏联选煤专家告诉我们：一定要分析某矿西部的煤质，以便确定其炼焦性能。可是我们根本没有做，致使工程设计长期停留在落后状态，不但不能接受苏联的先进定额，就是比现场工人已创造的定额也差得很远。譬如露天电铲的年采掘能力，现场实际能力已经超过设计的三分之二。某矿西部工程八十公尺场子设计日产量是三百吨，实际上有的矿已达到日产五百吨到七百吨。又如在巷道建设设计上不敢大胆采用新式断面与成型洋灰砖；在土木建筑上不敢大胆采用预制钢筋混凝土楼板；在对技工学校的配电设计上，按苏联经验，二百千伏安就够了；而我们竟按英美标准设计，用了五百千伏安。这一切都说明了我们的设计思想保守落后。
    为了接受这些教训，今后首先必须树立坚决信任苏联技术经验的观点，以最大的热情虚心地向苏联专家学习。要认真组织对苏联“国外设计书”的学习，有计划地向有关机关搜集与学习苏联设计经验。要组织设计人员认真学习俄文，作为学习苏联经验的桥梁。其次，在设计时，必须重视现场工人创造的先进经验，并在设计中加以采用；要将自己所做的设计在熟练的技工中报告，发动他们讨论并提出修正意见；必须亲往现场检验与核对自己获得的设计资料的真实性。
    第四、正确地制作与严格地审核初步设计，是节约投资的关键。过去我们对设计工作本身的节约不够重视，在基本建设投资及设计要求上是越大越多越好，因此造成很大的浪费。直到今年才有了初步转变。在一九五二年基本建设工程的设计中，由于我们重视了节约，重视了对苏联先进经验的采用，重视了审核工作，因而共节约了计划投资的百分之六点二，完成了局给的节约任务百分之一百二十三，完成自己奋斗目标的百分之一百二十。
    根据我们的经验，目前在设计上节约的关键往往在于设计原则的选择是否正确。因此，目前设计上的节约，应首先加强对于初步设计原则方案的审核，其次才应该是技术设计的节约。另一方面，我们不但要注意直接投资的节约，更须同时注意设计方案中长期管理费用的节约。如果为了节约少量的直接投资，反而增加了今后长期的大量管理费用，显然也是不经济的。
    第五、为了提高设计工作效率，必须对设计工程实行专责领导；为了保证设计技术先进，必须对设计人员实行专业化的培养。在这方面，我们过去做得很不够。在设计处成立以前，虽然有几个设计委员会，但人是现凑的，机构也不健全，更谈不到专业分工与长期培养；同是采煤设计，却没有统一组织起来。结果不但工作效率低，而且往往造成错误。去年十一月以后，虽然设计处成立了，但因为是由各有关设计部门拼凑而成的，同时又缺乏经验，因此在一九五二年设计的前半年，采取了按技术性质分成科、组的组织形式。这样，基本技术虽然可统一管理、交流经验，但重要工程仍无专责，在同一工程上各部门脱节，效率依然很低。根据以往的经验，今后应该：（1）根据有重点地完成国家主要工程设计任务的原则配备人力，指定专责工程负责人；（2）同一性质的一个以上的工程设计任务，可以划给一个专门性质的设计组担当，指定主任工程师领导，以便保证继续不断的循环流水作业；（3）在同一性质的设计组中，应按技术性质
    （如土木建筑、机械、电机采煤等）实行专业分工，以使其对业务更为熟练；（4）各组共同需要的特殊专业设计（如水道暖气、送电、变电等），另设专业组，以内部委托方式接受各组专责工程中的局部任务；（5）所有各组任务均应以正式手续下达（如任务确定通知书等）；（6）大胆地培养人才，不可依赖与等待。以上几点，经我们初步实行，觉得是设计部门内比较好的一种管理制度。我们认为不论在企业化或尚未企业化的设计部门，都应该这样做；尤其在人员缺乏时，更需要这样做。还没有完全企业化的部门，最好是成立一个专门机构，一方面管理限额以下厂矿的自作设计，以加强对局属厂矿设计的审核管理工作；另一方面专门办理一般的国内委托设计。
