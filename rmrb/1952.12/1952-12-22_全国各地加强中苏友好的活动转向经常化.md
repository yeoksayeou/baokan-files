Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Activities nationwide to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship have begun to transition towards becoming regularized.

    The organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in many regions have established practical new systems. Basic-level organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in cities such as Tianjin, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Hengyang, and Fujian Province have stipulated that they will hold Sino-Soviet friendship activities at least once a month, such as holding seminars, lectures, or cultural evenings, reading the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper," exhibiting Soviet pictures, and collectively watching Soviet films. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Room on Daxinggong Street in Nanjing has begun to add many books, newspapers, and magazines introducing the Soviet Union to meet the learning needs of residents. The Sixth District of Jinan has subscribed to 1,200 copies of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper," with an average of one newspaper for every eighteen members. The Fuzhou Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will establish a Sino-Soviet Friendship Rotating Reading Room, purchasing a large number of books and periodicals related to the Soviet Union and lending them in rotation among various basic-level organizations. Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places are also continuing to develop and consolidate their organizations. More than 1,500 basic-level organizations of the Chongqing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are selecting models. The Fifth District Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the city has held two training courses, gathering more than 300 cadres of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and activists from the masses to study the nature, tasks, and principles of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Many basic-level organizations in Fujian Province have held membership meetings to reorganize and develop their organizations.

    The mass movement of learning from Soviet advanced experience and learning Russian is continuing enthusiastically in various places. Factories, enterprises, and production groups in Dalian and Lushun have generally formulated specific plans for learning from Soviet advanced experience. After successfully experimenting with the Soviet "train-style towing method for boats" and high-speed cutting methods, the employees of the Fujian Provincial Company of the state-owned East China Inland River Shipping Company recently established a technical research association to vigorously promote various Soviet advanced experiences. Factories in Shenyang are rewarding a large number of model units and employees who have learned from Soviet advanced experience. The First District Federation of Trade Unions in Tianjin is preparing to organize a small-scale exhibition of Soviet advanced experience to help employees of private medium-sized and small factories learn from Soviet advanced experience. After being educated by various activities during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the broad masses of farmers have generally increased their enthusiasm for learning from Soviet advanced experience and increasing production patriotically. Many agricultural production mutual aid teams in Zhejiang Province have included learning Soviet advanced farming methods in their winter production plans. Farmers in Xishui County, Hubei Province, have generally included specific plans for learning Soviet advanced experience in their patriotic covenants, striving for a greater harvest next year. Teachers and students in schools across the country are continuing to carry out the "Learn from the Soviet Union" activities. Teachers in middle and primary schools in Tianjin are systematically studying "Pedagogy" by the Soviet education expert Kairov to carry out teaching reforms. Teachers at Fujian Medical College have automatically organized groups to study Pavlov's theory. More than 70 percent of the teachers at Xiamen University enthusiastically participated in Russian language learning. Students in Chongqing's secondary schools are working hard to strive to name their classes after Soviet youth heroes such as Zoya, Pavel, and Oleg. In order to provide students with systematic Sino-Soviet friendship education on a regular basis, the Chongqing Women's Normal School will establish lectures introducing Soviet literature, art, and science. Students in schools in Kaifeng often conduct Soviet book reading report meetings, Sino-Soviet friendship question-and-answer evenings, and other activities. Students in each class of the senior high school department of the city's First Girls' Middle School have also organized research groups in language, geography, and other subjects in conjunction with regular classes. The geography research group has created five geographical models, such as the Lenin Volga-Don Canal and the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, which are of great help to geography teaching.
