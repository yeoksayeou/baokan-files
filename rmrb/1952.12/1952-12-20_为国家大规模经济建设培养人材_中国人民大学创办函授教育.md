To cultivate a large number of on-the-job cadres in national financial and economic departments and enterprise organizations, and to improve their political thought and business theory levels, in order to meet the country's large-scale economic construction, Renmin University, based on the advanced correspondence education experience of Soviet higher education institutions, and with the approval of the Central Higher Education Department, has decided to first establish correspondence education in the three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan. Currently, there are nine correspondence specialized courses, including statistics, industrial accounting, economics planning, finance, banking, cooperatives, factory management, domestic trade, and foreign trade, totaling seventeen specialized classes (the factory management specialized course is divided into five specialized classes: metallurgy, machinery, coal mining, power industry, and textile; the cooperative specialized course is divided into three specialized classes: production, consumption, and supply and marketing; the statistics specialized course is divided into three specialized classes: industry, trade, and agriculture; and the industrial accounting, economics planning, finance, banking, domestic trade, and foreign trade specialized courses are also counted as specialized classes). Beijing and Tianjin will each have the above nine correspondence specialized courses and seventeen specialized classes, while Taiyuan will only have factory management and statistics two correspondence specialized courses, totaling eight specialized classes. The specialized courses and classes are scheduled to officially begin on February 7, 1953.

In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of correspondence education, a correspondence department has been established under the direct leadership of the president of Renmin University, and correspondence tutoring stations have been established in Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan respectively. Under the leadership of the correspondence department, the relevant departments and teaching and research offices of correspondence education have respectively determined the directors of correspondence departments, directors of correspondence teaching and research offices, and teachers.

Any on-the-job cadre who is ideologically progressive, physically healthy, has the ability to self-study, has participated in revolutionary work for more than three years, and has more than two years of business experience is eligible to apply. Currently, 2,332 correspondence students have been admitted.

The correspondence education plan stipulates that the duration of study for each class is one and a half years, divided into three semesters, each semester lasting twenty weeks, with eighteen hours of study per week, totaling 360 hours per semester and 1,080 hours for three semesters. The education plan determines that political courses (Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Political Economics, History of the Chinese Revolution) account for 420 hours, approximately 39% of the total hours, and professional courses account for 660 hours, approximately 61% of the total hours. The course allocation for the three semesters is, in principle, no more than four courses per semester. The first semester includes three political courses and one mathematics course; the second semester includes continuing to study the two political theory courses, Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism and Political Economics, while simultaneously studying two relevant professional theory courses; the third semester involves studying two to four professional courses, depending on the specific circumstances of each specialized class.

Correspondence teaching materials are designated or compiled by Renmin University, and the learning method is mainly self-study according to the teaching progress. The school issues teaching outlines, learning method instructions, and exercises, and provides tutoring within a certain period of time, organizes lectures, and checks homework. Teacher lectures and tutoring account for approximately 10% to 20% of the total time. Each correspondence tutoring station assists correspondence students in learning, organizes lectures and tutoring, quizzes and exams, and checks the students' completion of the study plan.

    为国家大规模经济建设培养人材
    中国人民大学创办函授教育
    为了大量培养国家财政经济部门、企业组织的在职干部，提高他们的政治思想与业务理论水平，以迎接祖国大规模的经济建设，人民大学根据苏联高等学校先进的函授教育经验，经中央高等教育部批准，决定先在北京、天津、太原等三大城市创办函授教育。目前暂设统计、工业会计、经济计划、财政、银行、合作社、工厂管理、国内贸易、对外贸易等九个函授专修班计十七个专业班（工厂管理专修班分冶金、机械、采煤、电业、纺织等五个专业班，合作社专修班分生产、消费、供销等三个专业班，统计专修班分工业、贸易、农业等三个专业班，及工业会计、经济计划、财政、银行、国内贸易、对外贸易等六个专修班亦作为专业班计算在内）。北京、天津各设上述九个函授专修班，十七个专业班，太原只设工厂管理、统计两个函授专修班计八个专业班，各专修班专业班定于一九五三年二月七日正式开学。
    为了加强函授教育的组织领导，在人民大学校长直接领导下已建立了函授部，并在北京、天津、太原分别设立了函授辅导站。在函授部领导下函授有关各系及教学研究室，已分别确定了函授系主任，函授教学研究室主任及教员。
    凡思想进步身体健康的在职干部，具备自修能力，参加革命工作三年以上，具有二年以上的业务经验者，均可投考。现已录取函授学员二千三百三十二名。
    函授教育计划规定各班修业期限为一年半，分三个学期进行，每学期二十周，每周学习时间为十八小时，每学期合计三百六十小时，三个学期共为一千零八十小时。教育计划确定政治课（马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学、中国革命史）为四百二十小时，约占总时数百分之三十九，业余课为六百六十小时，约占总时数百分之六十一。三个学期的课程分配，原则上每学期不超过四门课程，第一学期政治课三门、数学课一门，第二学期除继续学马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学两门政治理论课程外，同时学习各有关业务理论课两门，第三学期按各专业班的具体情况学习业务课二至四门不等。
    函授教材由人民大学指定或编写，学习方法按照教学进度以自学为主。学校印发教学提纲、学习方法指示及习题等，在一定时间内进行辅导，组织讲授并检查作业。教员课堂讲授和辅导约占全部时间的百分之十至二十。各函授辅导站帮助函授学员学习，组织讲授辅导、测验及考试，检查学员完成学习计划的情况。
