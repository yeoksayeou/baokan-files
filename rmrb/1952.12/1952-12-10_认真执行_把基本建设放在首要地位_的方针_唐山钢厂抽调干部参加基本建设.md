    Earnestly Implement the Policy of "Giving Priority to Basic Construction"
    Tangshan Steel Plant Transfers Cadres to Participate in Basic Construction
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Tangshan Steel Plant earnestly implemented the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's instruction of "Giving Priority to Basic Construction." After sufficient ideological mobilization work and the adoption of reasonable measures, a specific plan for transferring cadres to participate in basic construction work has been drafted. The plan stipulates that 60% of technical cadres will be transferred. Of the existing 56, 33 will be transferred. Of the original 7 engineers, 4 will be transferred. 50% of veteran cadres will be transferred. Of the existing 25, 12 will be transferred. 20% of general business management cadres will be transferred. Of the existing 400-plus, 80 will be transferred.
    The Tangshan Steel Plant's work in transferring cadres has been done relatively well. The main reason is that the plant's leading cadres have truly understood and resolutely implemented the central policy. At the same time, they paid special attention to ideological mobilization work when carrying out this work within the plant. After attending the Ministry of Heavy Industry's National Factory and Mine Directors Conference in Beijing from November 17th to 20th, the plant's director, Dai Mingyu, recognized the importance of basic construction. He said: "Before attending the National Factory and Mine Directors Conference, my vision was narrow, and I considered the affairs of my own unit more. Now I further understand that we must consider issues from the overall interests of the country. At present, the focus of the state's leadership over industry has shifted from production to basic construction, and basic construction has a decisive significance for the country's industrialization. Transferring capable cadres from production departments to participate in basic construction work is a top-priority political task. If there is departmentalism in implementing this task, it is an unforgivable mistake." After returning to the plant, he immediately discussed the issue of transferring cadres to participate in basic construction with the plant's Party committee and reported to the CPC Tangshan Municipal Committee. Subsequently, the plant's Party committee quickly convened an enlarged meeting of the Party committee attended by section chiefs, workshop directors, and workshop Party branch secretaries to begin discussing the issue of transferring cadres. At the meeting, Dai Mingyu conveyed the spirit of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's National Factory and Mine Directors Conference, repeatedly explaining the importance of basic construction, and pointing out that the Tangshan Steel Plant's urgent task was to immediately transfer a large number of cadres to strengthen the basic construction departments. At the same time, it was also necessary to do a good job in production and continue to train cadres. The meeting conducted a full discussion, and through mutual enlightenment and mutual criticism, resolved the problem of departmentalism that was prevalent among the cadres. For example, in the past, the head of the plant's cadre section always felt that the plant was short of cadres and thought that he had to ask the bureau to send people to fill the vacancies, and he rarely considered training cadres himself. Now he recognized this erroneous view at the meeting. The head of the materials section also made a self-criticism at the meeting, saying: "In the past, when the higher authorities transferred cadres from my section, I gave them up reluctantly. I always felt that it was not easy to promote cadres, and if familiar cadres were transferred away, the work would be difficult to do. If I were transferred, I would be even more worried, fearing that I would not be able to handle the new position. Now I have realized that if I do not change these partial views, the entire work will suffer." At the meeting, specific arrangements were also made for the mobilization work of each unit, requiring each unit to fully carry out ideological deliberation and propose plans for who should be transferred, who should be promoted, and who should be trained in their respective units. At the same time, the meeting appointed the Minister of the Party Committee's Organization Department, the Deputy Director of Personnel, and the Head of the Cadre Section to assist each unit in studying the situation and proposing a list as a basis for discussion by the Party Committee.
    On November 28th, the plant's Party committee held another meeting. In addition to determining the list of cadres to be transferred, the meeting made plans for cultivating reserve forces and decided on steps to mobilize all cadres in the plant. In terms of cultivating reserve forces, it was decided to select 20 young intellectual cadres from each section to go to the workshops for internships on the one hand, and to audit classes at Jiaotong University on the other, to train them into technical cadres; select 20 skilled workers to train them into technicians; gradually transform temporary workers into production workers; and equip each workshop and section with one to two deputy positions for responsible cadres. In addition, it is also planned to recruit 140 new apprentices and a number of educated youth and skilled workers. The steps for mobilizing all cadres in the plant were decided to be as follows: the Secretary of the Party Committee and the Director of the Plant will each give reports to everyone, organize the study of this newspaper's November 18th editorial "Giving Priority to Basic Construction," and conduct discussions, ensuring that every cadre recognizes the significance of giving priority to basic construction. On the other hand, various forms of publicity and mobilization will be adopted to create a climax of "willingness to accept organizational assignments to participate in the country's economic construction." Then, on the basis of full ideological mobilization work, the list of cadres to be transferred and promoted will be announced around December 15th. At the same time, it is necessary to emphasize doing a good job in the handover work. The Party organization must ensure that the transferred cadres are not only willing to obey the organizational transfer but also responsible for doing a good job in the handover. The promoted cadres must strive to familiarize themselves with the new business in the shortest possible time. It is expected that the work of transferring cadres from the Tangshan Steel Plant can be fully completed by December 20th.
    At present, in addition to carrying out the work of transferring a large number of cadres outward, the Tangshan Steel Plant is also preparing to transfer some personnel from the Mechanical Section to the plant's Basic Construction Section, promote a head of the Basic Construction Section, and establish an engineering team under the Basic Construction Section to strengthen the basic construction force of the unit.
    Although the Tangshan Steel Plant has decided to transfer so many cadres, the production tasks will not be greatly affected because the workers have already mastered the production technology, and new technical cadres can be continuously trained.

### 认真执行“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针  唐山钢厂抽调干部参加基本建设

    认真执行“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针
    唐山钢厂抽调干部参加基本建设
    【本报讯】唐山钢厂认真贯彻政务院财政经济委员会“把基本建设放在首要地位”的指示，经过了充分的思想动员工作和采取了合理的措施，已拟出了抽调干部参加基本建设工作的具体计划。计划决定技术干部按百分之六十抽调，现有五十六名，抽调三十三名，原有工程师七名，抽调四名；老干部按百分之五十抽调，现有二十五名，抽调十二名；一般业务管理干部按百分之二十抽调，现有四百余名，抽调八十名。
    唐山钢厂抽调干部的工作做得比较好，主要的原因是该厂的领导干部真正领会了并坚决执行了中央的方针，同时在厂内进行这项工作时特别注意了思想动员工作。该厂厂长戴明予十一月十七日到二十日到北京参加重工业部的全国厂矿长会议后，认清了基本建设的重要意义。他说：“没有参加全国厂矿长会议以前，自己眼界狭小，考虑本单位的事情较多；现在进一步懂得了要从国家的整体利益去考虑问题。目前国家对工业的领导重心已从生产转到了基本建设方面，基本建设对国家的工业化有着决定的意义。从生产部门抽调得力干部去参加基本建设工作，是一个头等重要的政治任务；如果在执行这个任务时有本位主义的思想，乃是不可宽恕的错误。”他回厂后，立即与工厂党委研究抽调干部参加基本建设的问题，并向中共唐山市委作了汇报。接着，该厂党委迅速召开了有科长、车间主任及车间党支部书记等参加的党委扩大会议，开始讨论抽调干部的问题。戴明予在会上传达了重工业部全国厂矿长会议的精神，反复地说明了基本建设的重要意义，并指出了唐山钢厂的迫切任务就是要立即抽调大批干部去充实基本建设部门；同时还要搞好生产，继续培养干部。会议进行了充分的讨论，经过互相启发、互相批评，解决了干部中普遍存在的本位主义思想问题。如该厂干部科长过去总觉得本厂干部缺，认为还要向局里要人来补足，自己很少考虑去培养干部。现在他在会上认识了这种错误的看法。材料科长也在会上检讨说：“过去上级调动自己科里的干部时，自己是咬紧牙关给的。总觉得提拔干部不容易，把熟悉的干部调走了，工作不好做；如果调动自己，顾虑更大，怕到新岗位上不能胜任。现在已认识到如不改变这些局部观点，就会使整个工作受到损失。”会上，对各单位的动员工作，也作了具体布置，要求各单位充分进行思想酝酿，并提出本单位抽调谁、提拔谁、培养谁的计划。会议同时推定党委组织部长、人事副厂长及干部科长负责协助各单位研究情况，提出名单，作为党委会讨论的依据。
    十一月二十八日，该厂党委会又召开了会议，会议除确定了抽调干部的名单外，作出了培养后备力量的措施计划，和决定了向全厂干部进行动员的步骤。在培养后备力量方面，决定从各科选出二十名青年知识分子干部，一方面下车间实习，一方面去交通大学旁听，培养成技术干部；选二十名技术工人培养成技术员；把临时工逐渐改变成生产工人；车间及各科负责干部各配备一名至二名副职。此外还准备新招学徒一百四十名及知识青年与技术工人若干名。对全厂干部进行动员的步骤，决定由党委书记及厂长分别向大家作报告，组织学习本报十一月十八日“把基本建设放在首要地位”的社论，并进行讨论，务须做到使每个干部都认识把基本建设提到首要地位的意义；另一方面，采取各种宣传鼓动方式，掀起一个“为参加祖国经济建设，乐意接受组织分配”的高潮。然后在充分的思想动员工作基础上，于十二月十五日前后公布抽调干部与提拔干部的名单。与此同时，要强调做好交接工作，党组织要保证使被调干部不仅乐意服从组织调动，而且要负责做好交代工作；被提拔的干部则要争取在最短时间内熟悉新的业务。预定到十二月二十日，唐山钢厂抽调干部的工作可以全部结束。
    目前，唐山钢厂除了进行向外抽调大批干部的工作外，还准备从机械科抽调一部分人员到厂内基本建设科，提拔一个基本建设科长，并在基本建设科下设立工程队，以加强本单位的基本建设力量。
    唐山钢厂虽然决定抽走这样多的干部，但是因为工人已经掌握了生产技术，而新的技术干部又可以不断地培养出来，生产任务是不会受很大影响的。
