Preliminary Experiences in Capital Construction in the Northeast Region This Year

The large-scale key capital construction in the Northeast region this year has achieved tremendous success. Many large-scale, modern factories and mines have completed their plans on schedule or ahead of schedule, and some have already begun production. More than 398,000 square meters of various school buildings and millions of square meters of employee dormitories, clinics, and sanatoriums have been completed. The total workload planned for this year by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government system alone is 2.4 times greater than in 1951, equivalent to 17.4 times that of 1949. In the process of completing the above tasks, the Party organizations and state-owned enterprise leading departments in the Northeast region have learned some experiences and have trained a strong capital construction team, creating favorable conditions for larger-scale construction next year.

Strengthening Leadership and Expanding Capital Construction Strength

In early 1952, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government, based on the new situation of economic development in the Northeast region, made a decision to strengthen the leadership of capital construction, pointing out that the industrial leading departments in the Northeast region must complete a historical and major shift—placing capital construction in a primary position, and the focus of industrial leadership should shift from production to capital construction. According to this decision, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government drew a large number of capable management cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers from the production departments to invest in the capital construction departments. The Coal Mine Management Bureau alone transferred more than 3,300 technical cadres and administrative management cadres and more than 8,600 skilled workers. By the end of September, the number of administrative cadres, technical cadres, and workers in the capital construction of the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department system was more than double that of the end of March of the same year, of which the number of skilled workers was equivalent to 229% of that of the end of March. Up to now, the capital construction institutions of various units have generally expanded by one time compared with the end of last year, and the manpower has increased by two to four times. This year, the more than 4,000 graduates from universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools assigned by the Central Government to the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department system in the spring and autumn have also been mostly transferred to the capital construction departments. In terms of organization, the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department and its affiliated management bureaus and some key factories and mines have established institutions dedicated to managing capital construction such as design, construction, finance, and materials; the construction force has developed from ten engineering companies to twenty-five. The professional institutions for capital construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company were originally only three or four, but later twelve offices dedicated to capital construction service were established at once; the construction force was originally only two engineering companies for civil engineering and mechanical and electrical, one furnace construction plant, and more than twenty engineering teams; later it developed into five engineering companies for civil engineering, metal structure, electrical installation, mechanical installation, and sanitary equipment, one furnace construction plant, and fifty-six engineering teams.

In addition to the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department, the Party committees and local governments of various provinces and cities, and trade unions at all levels, also promptly shifted their work focus to capital construction. The CPC Harbin, Anshan, Qiqihar, Changchun, Benxi and other municipal committees have transferred a large number of cadres to enrich the Party and mass organizations of the capital construction departments, and strengthened the direct supervision and leadership of capital construction work. In addition to assisting various capital construction units in organizing the supply of building materials such as bricks and tiles, the local governments also promptly recruited a large number of construction workers to solve the difficulties of the lack of construction workers in various units. In addition, other government departments have also vigorously cooperated with capital construction work. The Building Materials Company and Industrial Equipment Company of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department system have shifted from focusing on the management of production equipment to actively organizing the supply of building materials. The Northeast People's Government Finance Department gave priority to allocating advance payments to capital construction units in order to purchase materials and tools as early as possible. Various railway administrations and transportation companies also actively allocated vehicles to ensure the rapid and timely transportation of building materials. Scientific research institutions such as the Northeast Institute of Science actively carried out analysis and inspection of building materials and soil to ensure that engineering designs obtained reliable data. …

Various regions and departments have conscientiously implemented the policy of placing capital construction in a primary position, and have promptly and resolutely enriched the strength of capital construction, which has provided better conditions for the progress of capital construction work in the Northeast this year.

Sufficient Preparation Work

To ensure the completion of the capital construction plan on schedule and ahead of schedule, preparation work must be done well. Due to various reasons, the preparation work for capital construction in the Northeast this year was carried out relatively late; however, compared with previous years, there has been great progress. In terms of formulating the capital construction plan, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, in addition to repeatedly studying the needs of the country, also studied and calculated in detail the strength of design, equipment, materials, labor, technical personnel, investment, etc., and tried to achieve a balance with the planned workload. In this way, before the start of construction, there was a general idea of whether the annual plan could be completed. In terms of design work, in addition to transferring a large number of personnel to strengthen the design department, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government also opened a crash course for capital construction to train hundreds of specialized personnel in engineering geology, surveying, mapping, electrical lighting, water and heating, and valuation budgets. In order to ensure that the design has sufficient original data, the design company established a geological engineering team and a soil laboratory, and various units generally established or enriched the drilling force. In the design process, all units adopted the "Building Structure Design Standards" formulated according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In addition to improving the quality of design and saving a lot of investment, it also greatly saved design manpower and time. Thanks to the above measures, the design tasks of the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department system this year were basically completed before the end of June, except for individual units, changing the previous phenomenon of designing while constructing, or delaying the project for too long due to the incomplete design. In terms of construction preparation, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government allocated 30% of the advance payment before the start of construction, so that the construction units stored a part of the bricks, tiles, sand, stone and cement, wood that needed to be used as soon as construction started; at the same time, it organized transportation forces and transported these materials to the site in a timely manner. In particular, key projects such as Fuxin Power Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, under the direct assistance of Soviet experts, formulated a relatively complete construction organization design; from the determination of construction procedures, workload and engineering progress, the drawing of the construction general plan, to the supply of materials, the design of temporary dormitories, temporary roads and water and electricity supply, and the preparation of construction machinery..., comprehensive plans were made in advance to ensure that the work could proceed in an orderly manner after the start of construction.

Carry out the Movement to Establish Responsibility System

After a period of intense preparation, most of the projects started construction in June. However, due to lack of experience, poor Party and mass work foundation, and unsound institutions and systems, there was a widespread phenomenon of no one being responsible and irresponsibility in the construction units in the first period of construction; as a result, the project could not complete the plan according to the progress, the quality was poor, and advanced experience could not be promoted. In order to reverse this situation, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government system universally launched a movement to establish and improve the responsibility system.

(Later expanded to other department construction sites) The essence of this movement is to strengthen capital construction management on the basis of democratic movement. Through mass exposure, criticism and self-criticism, the style of many leading cadres has changed, actively going deep into the front line, relying on the masses to care for the masses; the sense of responsibility of most technicians and staff has been strengthened, and the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters has also been greatly improved. On the basis of everyone being responsible to the country, all units have established and improved various responsibility systems. In this way, it not only provides a strong guarantee for the completion of this year's national capital construction plan in terms of organizational management, but also lays a favorable foundation for the implementation of strict planned management and economic accounting system by various construction units in the future. The experience of the Northeast proves that the responsibility system is one of the basic principles of construction management. Without a responsibility system in capital construction, the completion of plans, the improvement of project quality, the promotion of advanced experience, and the realization of various effective measures to improve capital construction work cannot be guaranteed.

Vigorously Promote Advanced Experience

On the basis of vigorously strengthening the responsibility system, various capital construction departments have widely launched a movement to create and promote advanced experience. In order to create a mass movement for promoting advanced experience, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government held a grand conference to promote advanced experience in capital construction. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman, personally visited and awarded prizes. After the conference, the work of promoting advanced experience was further carried out, and various advanced experiences continued to emerge. Up to now, no less than hundreds of advanced experiences in capital construction have been promoted in the Northeast. In terms of design, there are interim standards for building structure design, standardized design, design assembly line...; in terms of civil engineering, there are concrete vacuum operation method, foundation one-time pouring method, Su Changyou bricklaying method...; in terms of installation, there are pre-assembly, sectional comprehensive installation method, installation assembly line...; in terms of mine construction, there are vertical shaft parallel operation, circular shaft lining method; in terms of drilling, there are Ma Wenzhi drilling method, rapid drilling of non-ferrous metals; in terms of construction management, there are parallel assembly line operation organized according to instructions diagrams, industrialization of construction, etc. These advanced experiences have a significant effect on speeding up construction, ensuring project quality, and reducing project costs. In particular, the promotion of the advanced experience of organizing parallel assembly line operations according to instructions diagrams not only overcomes the chaos in construction management, but also shortens the construction period by more than half. Many construction projects were completed ahead of schedule within a short construction period.

At the same time, mechanical construction was widely used in various important construction and installation enterprises. As of the end of October, the main construction machinery of the two major projects 101 and 102 in Anshan alone included five excavators, twelve cranes of various types used on tanks, automobiles, and railways, twenty-one winches, thirty universal loaders, one hundred and twenty electric welding machines, and eighty-seven automobiles. In addition to the establishment of the responsibility system movement, the large-scale use of mechanical construction is also an important reason why these key projects can complete the progress plan on schedule.

The victory on the capital construction front in the Northeast this year is inseparable from the great help of the Soviet Union. Many large factories and mines built in the Northeast this year were designed by the Soviet Union, and the latest automated equipment in these projects was also manufactured by the Soviet Union. After construction, many Soviet experts helped us and taught us how to install.

It is precisely because of the help of the great Soviet Union, and because we promoted advanced construction management methods, advanced technical methods, partially promoted construction mechanization, and promoted the economic accounting system on the construction site during the construction process, that the capital construction in the Northeast this year has moved a step closer to the "faster, better, and more economical" standards, and has basically victoriously completed the planned plan.

    东北区今年基本建设的初步经验
    东北地区今年有重点的大规模的基本建设已获巨大成就。许多规模宏大的近代化的工厂和矿井都按期或提前完成了计划，有的并已开始生产。三十九万八千余平方公尺的各种学校校舍和数百万平方公尺的职工宿舍、医务所、疗养院业已竣工。仅东北人民政府工业部系统，今年计划完成的工作总量就比一九五一年大二点四倍，相当于一九四九年的十七点四倍。在完成上述任务的过程中，东北地区的党组织和国营企业领导部门学习到了一些经验，并锻炼出了一支强大的基本建设队伍，给明年进行更大规模的建设创造了有利条件。加强领导，壮大基本建设力量
    一九五二年初，中共中央东北局与东北人民政府根据东北地区经济发展的新情况，作出了加强基本建设领导的决定，指出东北地区的工业领导部门必须完成一个历史性的重大转变——把基本建设放到首要地位，领导工业的重心要从生产转到基本建设方面来。根据这一决定，东北人民政府工业部从生产部门抽出了大批得力的管理干部、技术人员和技术工人投入基本建设部门，仅煤矿管理局即抽调了三千三百余名技术干部及行政管理干部和八千六百余名技术工人。到九月底止，东北人民政府工业部系统基本建设方面的行政干部、技术干部与工人比同年三月末增加了一倍多，其中技术工人相当于三月末的百分之二百二十九。到现在为止，各单位的基本建设机构比去年底普遍扩大了一倍，人力增加了二倍至四倍。今年春秋两季，中央分配给东北人民政府工业部系统的四千余名大学、专科与中等技术学校的毕业生，也绝大部分都输送给了基本建设部门。在组织上，东北人民政府工业部及其所属管理局和某些重点厂矿都成立了设计、施工、财务、材料等专管基本建设的机构；施工力量从十个工程公司发展成了二十五个。鞍山钢铁公司基本建设方面的专业机构原来只有三、四个，后来一下就成立了十二个专为基本建设服务的处；施工力量原来只有土木建筑、机械电气两个工程公司，一个筑炉厂，二十多个工程队；后来发展成了土木建筑、金属结构、电气安装、机械安装、卫生设备等五个工程公司，一个筑炉厂，五十六个工程队。
    除东北人民政府工业部外，各省市党委、地方政府与各级工会也及时地将工作重心转向了基本建设。中共哈尔滨、鞍山、齐齐哈尔、长春、本溪等市委都抽调大批干部充实了基本建设部门的党群机构，并加强了对基本建设工作的直接监督与领导。各地方政府除协助各基本建设单位组织了砖瓦等建筑材料的供应外，并及时招收了大批建筑工人，解决了各单位缺乏建筑工人的困难。此外，政府其他部门也大力配合了基本建设工作。东北人民政府贸易部系统的建筑器材公司、工业器材公司由偏重于注意生产器材的经营转而为积极组织建筑材料的供应。东北人民政府财政部门尽先给基本建设单位筹拨预付款，以便及早购置材料、工具。各铁路管理局和搬运公司也都积极地调配车辆，保证建筑材料的运输迅速、及时。东北科学研究所等科学研究机关则积极进行建筑材料与土壤的分析检验，保证工程设计获得可靠的资料。……
    各个地区，各个部门都认真地贯彻把基本建设放到首要地位的方针，及时地、坚决地充实了基本建设力量，这就使东北今年基本建设工作的进行有了较好的条件。
    充分的准备工作
    要保证按期和提前完成基本建设计划，必须做好准备工作。由于种种原因，东北今年的基本建设准备工作进行得比较晚；但与往年相比，却有很大进步。在编制基本建设计划方面，东北人民政府工业部除反复研究了国家的需要之外，并详细研究、计算了设计、设备、材料、劳动力、技术人员、投资等各方面的力量，尽量求得与计划工作量取得平衡，这样，在开工前就对全年计划的能不能完成大体上有了数。在设计工作方面，东北人民政府工业部除抽调了大批人员加强设计部门外，直属设计公司并开办了基本建设速成学校，训练了数百名工程地质、测量、制图、电气照明、水道暖气及估价预算等专门人员。为了保证设计有充足的原始资料，设计公司成立了地质工程队和土壤试验室，各单位普遍建立或充实了钻探力量。在进行设计中，各单位都采用了根据苏联先进经验制定的“建筑物结构设计标准”，除提高了设计质量，节省了大量投资外，并且大大节省了设计的人力和时间。由于采取了上述各项措施，今年东北人民政府工业部系统的设计任务，除个别单位外，基本上都在六月底以前完成，改变了以前一面设计一面施工，或因设计完不成而使工程拖延过迟的现象。在施工的准备方面，东北人民政府工业部在开工前拨出了预付款百分之三十，使各施工单位储备了一部分开工即需使用的砖、瓦、砂、石和水泥、木材；同时组织运输力量，及时把这些材料运到了现场。特别是阜新发电厂、鞍山钢铁公司等重点工程，更在苏联专家的直接帮助下，拟制了比较完备的施工组织设计；从建设程序、工作量和工程进度的确定、施工总平面图的绘制，到材料的供应，临时宿舍、临时道路及水电供应的设计，施工机械的准备……，都预先做出周密的计划，保证了开工后工作得以有条不紊地进行。
    开展建立责任制运动
    经过了一段紧张的准备工作，大部工程于六月间开工了。但由于缺乏经验，党群工作基础差，各种机构与制度都不健全，在开工的头一个时期，各施工单位中普遍存在着严重的无人负责和不负责任现象；以致工程不能按进度完成计划，质量低劣，先进经验不能推广。为扭转这一局面，东北人民政府工业部系统普遍展开了建立与健全责任制运动。
    （其后扩展到了其他部门的工地）这次运动的实质，是在民主运动的基础上加强基本建设管理。通过群众性的揭发、批评与自我批评，许多领导干部作风转变了，积极深入现场，依靠群众关心群众；大部技术人员和职员的责任心加强了，工人的主人翁责任感也大大提高。在这种人人对国家负责的基础上，各单位都建立与健全了各种责任制度。这样，不仅在组织管理上给完成今年国家的基本建设计划以有力保证，而且为今后各施工单位实行严格的计划管理和经济核算制奠定了有利基础。东北的经验证明：责任制是施工管理的基本原则之一。基本建设中如果没有责任制，计划的完成、工程质量的提高、先进经验的推广，以及改进基本建设工作的各项有效措施的实现，都是无从保证的。
    大力推广先进经验
    在大力加强责任制的基础上，各基本建设部门广泛掀起了创造与推广先进经验运动。为把推广先进经验造成一个群众性运动，东北人民政府工业部曾召开了隆重的基本建设先进经验推广大会，东北人
    民政府高岗主席、林枫副主席曾亲自前往参观、授奖。大会之后，推广先进经验的工作进一步展开，各种先进经验不断出现。到现在，全东北已推行的基本建设先进经验不下百余种。在设计方面有建筑物结构设计暂行标准、标准化设计、设计流水作业……；在土木建筑方面有混凝土真空作业法、基础一次浇灌法、苏长有砌砖法……；在安装方面有预装配、分段综合安装法、安装流水作业……；在矿井建设方面有竖井平行作业、循环砌井法；在钻探方面有马文志钻探法、有色金属快速钻探；在施工管理方面有按指示图表组织平行流水作业、施工工厂化等等。这些先进经验对加快建设速度、保证工程质量、降低工程成本都有重大作用。特别是推行按指示图表组织平行流水作业的先进经验，不仅克服了施工管理上的混乱现象，并且使工期缩短了二分之一以上，许多建设工程在短促的施工期内提前完了工。
    与此同时，各重要的建筑安装企业中又广泛采用了机械施工。至十月底为止，仅鞍山一○一、一○二两大工程的主要施工机械即有挖土机五台、坦克式、汽车式及铁路上用的各式起重机十二台，卷扬机二十一台，万能装载机三十台，电焊机一百二十台，汽车八十七辆。除了建立责任制运动外，大量采用机械施工，也是使这些重点工程能够按期完成进度计划的重要原因。
    今年东北基本建设战线上的胜利和苏联的巨大帮助是分不开的。今年东北建设的许多大型工厂和矿井都是苏联设计的，这些工程中最新式的自动化的设备，也是苏联承制的。施工以后，又有许多苏联专家帮助我们、教给我们进行安装。
    正由于伟大苏联的帮助，以及我们在施工过程中推行了先进的施工管理方法、先进的技术方法，部分地推行了施工机械化和推行了工地经济核算制，东北今年的基本建设才向“又快、又好、又省”的
    标准前进了一步，并在基本上胜利地完成了预定计划。
