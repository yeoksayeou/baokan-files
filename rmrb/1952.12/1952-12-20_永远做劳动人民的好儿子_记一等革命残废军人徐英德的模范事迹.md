    Always Be a Good Son of the Working People
    ——On the Model Deeds of First-Class Revolutionary Disabled Soldier Xu Yingde
         Yang Zhicheng, Lian He
    At the model selection conference for revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and preferential treatment workers held by the Chuxian County People's Government of Anhui Province on November 3rd, Xu Yingde, a first-class revolutionary disabled soldier (Communist Party member), was selected as a first-class model. This is the second time he has received the title of model. Last winter, he was also named a model and attended the First Congress of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers, and Supporting-the-Army-and-Giving-Preference-to-Family-Members Models of the Former Northern Anhui District.

    Xu Yingde is from Gushan Township, Chuxian County. He grazed cattle and farmed for landlords from childhood, enduring the landlords' exploitation and oppression. In 1942, at the age of twenty-three, he joined the revolutionary armed forces, the New Fourth Army. He served as a squad leader, platoon leader, and company commander, and was wounded four times. During the Huaihai Campaign in November 1948, he led an assault platoon in a charge, was wounded in the arm, but persisted in commanding. Later, his thigh was broken by enemy machine-gun fire, and he was taken off the front lines and hospitalized for treatment. When he was discharged from the hospital in June 1949, he became a first-class revolutionary disabled soldier. He was demobilized in May 1950 and returned to his hometown.

    Xu Yingde was educated by the Party for a long time and fought bravely in the revolutionary army for six years. Now disabled, he was unwilling to be an idler. Upon returning to his hometown, he resolutely joined agricultural labor. For a person with a broken leg and an injured arm, this was very difficult. At first, he could only do some light work. But later he learned to do fieldwork – plastering the ridges of the fields. He would plaster two chi (a Chinese unit of measurement, approximately 1/3 meter) at a time, move two steps with his crutches, and then sit on the ridge to rest when he was tired. Later, he learned to weed. He put his broken leg in the crutch rest, wielded a four-chi-long weeding knife in both hands, and weeded the surrounding grass, then moved to another area. Weeding in dry land was easier: he brought a small stool and sat in the field to hoe, and his work efficiency was about the same as an average person. But he was not satisfied with this. He thought: Is this all I can do? The most important work in farming is harrowing and plowing; can't I do that? Yes! I must learn it! He found an old ox with a slow pace and began to learn harrowing: putting his crutch on the harrow, sitting on the harrow, and driving the ox. When plowing, he held a crutch in one hand and the plow in the other, slowly plowing forward. When turning, he would stop the ox, put his broken leg in the crutch rest, and use both hands to force the plow over. Over time, he could maneuver the plow with one hand. However, plowing is not a simple matter for people with disabled hands and legs. He fell into the mud countless times in order to learn to plow. When he fell, he got up again. Once he fell badly, and the wound became inflamed again. But as soon as the wound healed, he immediately picked up the plow again and shouted at the old ox in the field. He never complained of hardship or difficulty. His strong perseverance finally enabled him to learn agricultural labor and reach a proficient level. In the patriotic production increase movement, he promoted the production of the entire village with his exemplary actions. The farmers often said in production: We have to look at Comrade Xu Yingde! At the same time, the farmers' production enthusiasm also encouraged him. He thought: I am a Communist Party member, I must not fall behind the masses. This year, he accumulated more than 400 dan (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 50 kg) of manure and achieved three plows, four harrows, and three weedings and three hoeings. During the drought, he adjusted the amount of water used and raised the ridges to store water, overcoming the drought. As a result, his nine mu and two fen (a Chinese unit of area, approximately 1/15 hectare) of land yielded thirty-four shi (a Chinese unit of dry measure, approximately 100 liters) of grain this year, exceeding the normal yield by 20%.

    Xu Yingde loves labor and also loves the people. He has never put on the airs of a "hero." He said: "I was the son of the working people in the past, I am still the son of the working people now, and I will always be the son of the working people in the future." According to his situation, he could have enjoyed full land contract cultivation; but he only enjoys twenty or thirty man-days each year. He said: "I can do it myself, why bother the masses? The masses are also very busy!" He doesn't even want the masses to help with voluntary labor during the "August 1st" Army Day. He said: "Go and help the martyrs' families and military families who are more difficult than me!" He always enthusiastically helps solve problems for the masses. One night, Zhu Changyou and his wife quarreled, and his wife committed suicide by drowning. After hearing the news, he immediately supported himself with crutches and mobilized the masses to go down to the pond and save her. Later, he helped to hold a meeting to reconcile the couple. Because of his patient education, the people in the vicinity are very united. He also often checks the production of the masses, tells them of any shortcomings he sees, and if he sees that someone's field is leaking, he goes down to the field to repair it.

    Xu Yingde is now a member of the township Party branch. In the township, he takes the initiative to unite cadres and study work. He has taken the lead in all kinds of work. But he is not proud at all. At this model selection conference, he said: "I want to forever 'maintain glory, carry forward glory' in the construction of our great motherland, and I will contribute all my strength."

    永远做劳动人民的好儿子
    ——记一等革命残废军人徐英德的模范事迹
         杨治诚  联和
    安徽省滁县人民政府在十一月三日召开的革命烈属、军属、革命残废军人及优抚工作者评选模范会议上，一等革命残废军人（共产党员）徐英德当选了一等模范。这是他第二次获得模范称号。去年冬季他也被评为模范，出席了前皖北区第一届革命烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人及拥军优属模范代表大会。
    徐英德是滁县孤山乡人，从小给地主家放牛、种田，受尽了地主的剥削和压迫。一九四二年，他二十三岁的那年，参加了革命武装新四军。先后当过班长、排长、连长，负伤四次。一九四八年十一月的淮海战役中，他带领突击排冲锋，手臂受伤，还坚持指挥。后来大腿被敌人的机枪打断，才下了火线，入院冶疗。一九四九年六月出院时，他成了一等革命残废军人。一九五零年五月复员，回到家乡。
    徐英德受了党的长期教育，在革命部队里英勇地战斗了六年，如今残废了，但他不愿意做一个吃闲饭的人。他回到家乡，便毅然参加了农业劳动。对于一个断了一条腿、伤了一只手臂的人，这是非常困难的。开始时他只能做些轻活。但后来他就学着做田里活——贴田埂了。他一回贴二尺远，扶拐移两步再贴，累了坐在田埂上休息一下。后来就学耨草。他把一条断腿插在拐档子上，两手操着四尺多长的草刀，把周围的草耨光，然后换一块地方。在旱地里锄草比较容易：他带一张小板凳坐在田里锄，工作效率和一般人差不多。但他并不满足于这些。他想：我只能做这点活吗？种田最主要的工作是耙田、犁田，我不能干吗？能！一定学会它！他找了条步子慢的老牛，开始学耙田：把拐子放在耙上，坐在耙上驱使着牛。犁地时，他一手扶拐，一手扶犁，慢慢地向前耕。转弯的时候，他呵住牛，把断腿插在拐档上，两手使力把犁摆过来。时间长了，他一只手也能摆弄犁了。但是，耕田对于手和腿残废了的人终究不是简单的事情。他为了学耕田，曾无数次地跌倒在泥田里。跌倒了，他又爬起来。有一次跌得很厉害，伤口都重新发炎了。但伤口一好，他马上又扶起了犁，在田里叱喝着老牛。他从没有叫过苦、喊过困难。坚强的毅力，终于使他学会了农业劳动，并达到了熟练的程度。在爱国增产运动中，他以模范的行动推动了全村的生产。农民们在生产中常说：我们要看看徐英德同志呀！同时，农民们的生产热情也鼓舞了他。他想：我是共产党员，无论如何不能落在群众后面。今年他积了四百多担粪，作到了耕三、耙四和三耨、三锄。在抗旱时，他调剂了用水量，并把田埂增高来蓄水，战胜了旱灾。这样，今年他家的九亩二分田收了三十四石粮食，超过了常年产量二成。
    徐英德热爱劳动，也热爱人民。他从来没有摆过“功臣”架子。他说：“我过去是劳动人民的儿子，现在还是劳动人民的儿子，今后永远都是劳动人民的儿子。”按照他的情况，本来可以享受全部土地包耕的；但是他每年只享受二、三十个人工。他说：“我能做还是我自己做，何必要麻烦群众？群众也都很忙呀！”连“八一”建军节时群众帮助义务劳动，他都不要。他说：“去帮助比我困难的烈属、军属吧！”群众有什么事情，他总热情地帮助解决。一天夜晚，朱长有和老婆吵嘴，老婆投水自杀。他得讯后，立即扶着拐杖动员群众下塘把人救了上来。以后又帮助开了会，使他们夫妇和好起来。由于他的耐心教育，附近的群众都非常团结。他也经常检查群众生产，看到什么缺点就告诉群众，看到谁家的田漏水，就下田修补好。
    徐英德现在是本乡党支部的委员。在乡里主动团结干部，研究工作。在各种工作中，他都起了带头作用。但他一点都不骄傲。在这次评选模范大会上，他说：“我要永远地‘保持光荣，发扬光荣’在伟大祖国的建设事业中，我要贡献一切力量。”
