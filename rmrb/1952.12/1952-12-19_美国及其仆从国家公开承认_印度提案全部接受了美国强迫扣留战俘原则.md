Xinhua News Agency, December 17th – The Indian proposal on the repatriation of prisoners of war, passed by the United Nations General Assembly under the control of the United States, fully accepts the absurd US principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation," which is in reality the forcible detention of prisoners of war. Even the United States and its loyal puppets openly admit that this proposal is essentially a slightly modified version of the US proposal. Therefore, they have expressed praise, welcome, and support for the Indian proposal from the very beginning. If anyone still wants to say that this proposal does not endorse "voluntary repatriation," the following reports from the US and British sides will prove that such words are completely untrue.

As early as November 13th, the Christian Science Monitor of the United States, which had prior knowledge of the content of the Indian proposal, revealed: "This (Indian) plan will provide the substance of voluntary repatriation and meet the requirements of the US side." On November 19th, the day the Indian proposal was submitted to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the official spokesperson of the United States at the United Nations praised it, saying that the proposal "affirmatively supports" the US "principle." US Secretary of State Acheson, in his speech to the Political Committee on November 24th, also unreservedly believed: "We are in complete agreement with the spirit of this proposal." He pointed out: "The Indian proposal straightforwardly raises the fundamental issue, which is the principle of not using force to detain or repatriate prisoners of war... We welcome and are willing to openly consider any suggestion that affirms this principle." He believed that the Indian proposal was exactly the same as the US proposal, saying: "There are, of course, some methodological differences between the Indian proposal and the twenty-one-nation proposal... The twenty-one-nation proposal is a very short proposal, which states several principles, while the Indian proposal is much more detailed, stipulating the institutions to implement these principles. However, I do not think that this is a fundamental or significant difference at all." According to a United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on November 20th, Tokyo diplomatic observers pointed out: "The Indian proposal is in line with the principles advocated by the United States, and is very similar to one of the three proposals put forward by the United Nations Command delegation at Panmunjom on September 28th before the negotiations fell into the current indefinite recess."

The most loyal puppets of the United States also echoed the call. After the Indian proposal was put forward, Britain did its best to lobby for the passage of the Indian proposal for the United States. According to a United Press International dispatch from London on November 21st, British "officials" admitted that "the British delegation to the United Nations General Assembly actively engaged in behind-the-scenes activities to gather support for the Indian proposal." These "officials" said that Britain agreed with the Indian proposal, first because it "guaranteed the principle of non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war." The British delegation also specifically issued a statement on November 23rd, praising the Indian proposal for "fully preserving the principle of non-forcible repatriation." The French delegation to the United Nations also expressed "basic agreement" with the Indian proposal because it "basically focuses on the principle of non-forcible repatriation." Following closely behind Britain and France, many of the United States' puppet states, such as Australia and Canada, also echoed the Indian proposal like parrots. The United States Information Service reported on November 27th that at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on November 27th, "nine countries praised the Indian proposal, saying that the proposal upholds the principle of voluntary repatriation of prisoners."

Under the manipulation of the US-British aggressive bloc, this Indian proposal, which fully met the requirements of the United States, was passed on December 1st by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The US-British aggressive bloc was overjoyed at the realization of its conspiracy. According to reports from the United States Information Service and United Press International, the American spokesperson in the United Nations said at a press conference on the 2nd that "the United Nations' adoption of the Indian proposal is, in effect, a unanimous adoption of the principle of non-forcible repatriation. Washington is very pleased about this." The US spokesperson said that Acheson stated at the beginning of this session of the United Nations General Assembly: "What the United States needs most is a Korean armistice that complies with the principle of non-forcible repatriation. If the goal of an armistice cannot be achieved, the United States hopes to endorse the principles advocated by the United States." The spokesperson said that the passage of the Indian proposal "is an expression of endorsement." The British Foreign Office spokesperson also said on December 2nd: "The British government welcomes the result of the UN vote on India's Korean proposal with the utmost satisfaction."

The New York Times, in its commentary on the Indian proposal on December 3rd, further revealed the essence of the Indian proposal. The New York Times said:

"The Indian proposal is fully in line with the principles of a glorious peace based on what the United Nations negotiators have strived for at Panmunjom." In other words, the Indian proposal is merely a restatement, in another textual form, of the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle" that the US negotiating representatives have stubbornly insisted on for a year at Panmunjom. This so-called "principle" fundamentally violates the principle of complete repatriation stipulated in the Geneva Convention and has been resolutely opposed by the Korean and Chinese sides from beginning to end.

### 美国及其仆从国家公开承认  印度提案全部接受了美国强迫扣留战俘原则

    美国及其仆从国家公开承认
    印度提案全部接受了美国强迫扣留战俘原则
    【新华社十七日讯】本届联合国大会在美国把持下通过的关于遣返战俘的印度提案，全部接受了美国名为“自愿遣返”或“不得强迫遣返”实为强迫扣留战俘的荒谬原则，甚至美国及其忠实仆从也公开承认这个提案实质上只是稍加文字修饰的美国提案，因此它们从一开始就对印度提案表示称赞、欢迎和支持。有人还要想说这个提案不赞成“自愿遣返”，下面的许多美英方面的报道就证明这种话完全不合乎事实。
    早在十一月十三日，事先已知印度提案内容的美国基督教科学箴言报即已透露：“这（印度）方案将提供自愿遣返的实质而符合美国方面的要求。”印度提案于十一月十九日在联合国大会政治委员会提出的当天，美国在联合国的官方发言人就赞扬说：这个提案“肯定地支持”美国的“原则”。美国国务卿艾奇逊十一月二十四日在政治委员会上发表的演说中，也毫不掩饰地认为：“我们完全与这个提案的精神一致。”他指出：“印度提案直截了当地提出了基本问题，就是：不得使用武力来扣留或遣返战俘的原则……我们欢迎并愿意开诚考虑任何肯定这个原则的建议。”他认为印度提案与美国的提案完全一模一样，他说：“印度提案与二十一国提案之间当然有着一些方法上的不同……二十一国提案是一个很短的提案，它说明了几个原则，而印度提案则比较详细得多，它规定了实现这些原则的机构。但是，我认为这根本不是基本性的或重大的不同。”据合众社东京十一月二十日电说，东京外交观察家指出：“印度的建议是和美国所主张的原则符合的，而且和谈判还未陷入目前无限期休会状态以前，联合国军代表团于九月二十八日在板门店所提出的三个建议之一非常相似。”
    美国的最忠实的仆从也群起呼应。在印度提案提出以后，英国就极力替美国为通过印度提案而奔走。据合众社伦敦十一月二十一日电报道，英国“官方人士”承认，“英国出席联合国大会的代表团积极进行幕后活动，纠集各国支持印度的建议。”这些“官方人士”说，英国同意印度的建议，首先是因为它“保障了非强迫遣返战俘的原则”。英国代表团并特地在十一月二十三日发表声明，赞扬印度提案“完全保留了非强迫遣返的原则”。法国出席联合国的代表团也表示“基本上赞成”印度提案，因为它“基本上是着重不强迫遣返原则的”。紧跟在英国、法国之后，美国的许多仆从国家如澳大利亚、加拿大等也像应声虫一样极口称道印度提案。美国新闻处在十一月二十七日报道说，在十一月二十七日的联合国大会政治委员会上，“有九个国家赞扬印度提案，说这个提案维护了自愿遣返俘虏的原则”。
    在美英侵略集团的操纵之下，这个完全适合美国要求的印度提案在十二月一日在联合国大会政治委员会上通过了。美英侵略集团对于自己的阴谋获得实现，大喜过望。据美国新闻处和合众社报道，联合国中的美国发言人在二日举行记者招待会时说，“联合国通过了印度提案，实际上就是一致通过了不强迫遣返的原则，华盛顿对于这一点，感到非常欣慰。”美国发言人说，艾奇逊在本届联合国大会开始时就表示：“美国最最需要的是符合不强迫遣返原则的朝鲜停战。假如达不到停战目标的话，美国就希望赞同美国所主张的原则。”发言人说，印度提案的通过，“就是赞同的表示”。英国外交部发言人也在十二月二日说：“英国政府以最为满意的心情，欢迎联大关于印度的朝鲜提案的表决结果。”
    “纽约时报”在十二月三日评论印度提案时，进一步道出了印度提案的本质。“纽约时报”说：
    “印度提案完全符合联合国谈判人员在板门店力争的光荣和平基础的原则”。换句话说，印度提案只不过是用另一种文字上的形式，重述了美方谈判代表在板门店顽固地坚持了一年之久的所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”，而这个所谓“原则”是根本违反日内瓦公约所规定的全部遣返原则，并为朝中方面所自始至终坚决反对的。
