Xiao Wusheng of "Ji'an Pictorial" Should Not Undermine the Marriage Law

To the Editor:

Sun Guiying, a 17-year-old woman from Yunzhuang Village, Jishui County, Jiangxi Province, and her husband, Xiao Yanyi, 35, have a poor relationship, so she is determined to request a divorce. On November 12th, Xiao Wusheng, a worker from the "Ji'an Pictorial" office, came to the village. After learning about Sun Guiying's intention to divorce, he privately set up a "court" and "interrogated" Sun Guiying with great fanfare. He threatened Sun Guiying, saying, "If you want a divorce, I'll send you to the court in shackles and handcuffs, and see if you still want a divorce!" Sun Guiying was so frightened that she turned pale. Some women said, "Don't even think about divorcing, no matter how unsuitable the marriage is." Xiao Wusheng told the local cadres, "In the future, if you promote the Marriage Law, you are undermining government decrees and must conduct self-criticism." He also demanded that Xu Danu, the local women's director, and Liu Hongwen, the deputy township head, conduct "self-criticism." Xiao Wusheng, as a staff member of the "Ji'an Pictorial" office, not only does not promote and implement the Marriage Law, but also obstructs and undermines it. This is intolerable. I suggest that the responsible comrades of the office conduct an investigation. And please ask the People's Government to promptly handle Sun Guiying's marriage problem according to the law.

    “吉安画报”社萧武生不应该破坏婚姻法
    编辑同志：江西吉水县云庄村妇女孙桂英，十七岁，丈夫萧炎益三十五岁，两人感情不好，因此她决心请求离婚。十一月十二日，“吉安画报”社工作员萧武生来到村中，知道孙桂英要离婚的事以后，便私自设了“公堂”，威风凛凛地“审问”孙桂英，恐吓孙桂英说：“你要离婚，就送你到法院带脚镣手铐，看你离婚不离婚！”孙桂英被吓得面如土色。有的妇女则说：“再不合适的婚姻也不要想离了。”萧武生对当地干部们说：“今后你们要宣传婚姻法，就是破坏政府法令，要检讨。”他还要当地妇女主任许大女和副乡长刘洪文“检讨”。萧武生身为“吉安画报”社的工作人员，不但不宣传贯彻婚姻法，反而从中阻挠破坏，这是不能容忍的。我建议该社负责同志加以检查。并请人民政府及时依法处理孙桂英的婚姻问题。  毛春新
