Tianjin State-Owned Trade System

Preliminary Achievements of Tianjin State-Owned Trade System in Piloting Warehouse Economic Accounting System
Shen Wenying

Since September, the Tianjin State-Owned Trade System has been piloting the warehouse economic accounting system. After measurement and quota setting, it has initially understood the available area of warehouses, greatly increasing the utilization rate. Furthermore, it can now track the types of goods stored, their arrival times, and departure times. This creates favorable conditions for the enterprise management of warehouses.

I. Why is Warehouse Utilization Rate So Low?

Before the pilot implementation of the warehouse economic accounting system, warehouse managers in the Tianjin State-Owned Trade System were constantly complaining about the lack of warehouse space and requesting the construction of more warehouses. However, no one knew the exact size of the existing warehouses or how much they could hold. For example, the Tianjin Trust Company's warehouse was very disorganized. Goods were simply stuffed into empty spaces, and goods that arrived earlier were buried under stacks. When the company came to pick up goods, they would search frantically, turning the warehouse into a mess. While it appeared that the warehouse was full, with no room to walk, the stacking was not up to standard, and the wall spacing was not up to standard, so it wasn't really "full." Now, after measurement, the available area has been determined, and it has been found that the utilization rate of these warehouses is only 24.5 percent. The Tianjin Department Store's Third Warehouse had a utilization rate of only 48 percent in the past. The warehouses under the Tianjin Warehouse Management Office had a higher utilization rate, but it was still only 59 percent. Due to the lack of knowledge of inventory and poor storage management, serious backlog and losses of goods have occurred, causing enormous losses to state property. In the Nanzhan No. 1 Wharf warehouse of the Tianjin Warehouse Management Office, over 210 tons of oil felt worth 1.4 billion yuan from the China Import Company Tianjin Branch had been stored since before September of last year. Due to improper storage, all of the oil felt deteriorated, but the rent for the space it occupied was over 40 million yuan. In December of last year, the Tianjin Import Company had eight boxes of imported measuring instruments, weighing 2.28 tons, stored in the warehouse. These were urgently needed for national infrastructure construction, but they remained backlogged until the warehouse was cleared. Some goods that the sales departments lacked were stockpiled in large quantities in the warehouses. The Tianjin Department Store constantly transferred cigarette paper from Shanghai, but the company had 66 boxes of cigarette paper stockpiled at the Nanzhan No. 1 Wharf warehouse for almost a year.

II. Conducting Measurement, Setting Quotas, and Improving Warehouse Management

In September, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee for the Pilot Implementation of Enterprise Management of State-Owned Trade Warehouses, the Tianjin State-Owned Trade System warehouses began piloting the economic accounting system. This required measuring and drawing maps to calculate the total area, available area, and unit area quota for major commodities. The specific method was to measure all obstacles, buildings, wall spacing, and the area occupied by inventory stacks in the warehouse and on the storage yard, and draw a map to accurately calculate the total area of the warehouse and storage yard. From the total area, subtract the area occupied by obstacles, buildings, the necessary distance between them and the storage yard, and the area occupied by roads necessary for the entry and exit of goods, loading and unloading, and the wall spacing for storing goods to obtain the available area. Then, based on the different commodity conditions such as department stores, industrial equipment, grain, and minerals, and different packaging methods such as sacks, paper packages, mat packages, cloth packages, barrels, boxes, and iron sheet packaging, calculate the spacing and distance between cargo stacks and cargo spaces (if it is a multi-story warehouse, the different load ratios of the upper and lower floors must be calculated when placing goods). This allows for the preliminary determination of the area quota for each 30-ton carload of various goods in the storage yard and warehouse, which is the unit area quota per car.

After measurement, the total area of the storage yards of the Tianjin State-Owned Trade System was 520,000 square meters larger than the figure reported by various units in July of this year. Based on the average unit area per car of major commodities, it can store approximately 11,000 more carloads of goods. Fully utilizing this storage capacity can save the state over 3.41 billion yuan per month.

Each unit calculates the available area of the warehouse and the unit area quota for major commodities, calculates how much cargo can be stored in the warehouse, and, based on the current procedures, systems, books, reports, the process of each task, and the throughput of the warehouse, combined with improving various work systems, formulates personnel quotas. With personnel quotas, manpower can be used more rationally, and surplus personnel can be transferred to other positions. For example, the Hedong Warehouse of the Tianjin Warehouse Management Office can reduce its staff by 16 percent after implementing quotas.

After determining the available area and personnel quotas, further formulate expense quotas. Expense quotas are calculated by accurately calculating the total wages based on personnel quotas; then, based on the total storage quota, and in accordance with the expenditure standards prescribed by the higher authorities, calculate the depreciation of fixed assets, the depreciation of low-value and easily consumable items; plus the warehouse rental fee. Once expense quotas are in place, the unit cost per square meter of warehouse space can be calculated. Adding a reasonable profit to that cost yields a fair warehouse rental fee. After the Tianjin Warehouse Management Office implemented expense quotas, warehouse rental fees decreased by an average of 37 percent compared to the past.

III. The Main Experience is Following the Mass Line

The main experience gained by the Tianjin State-Owned Trade System in piloting enterprise management of warehouses is that it is necessary to rely closely on the masses, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and resolutely overcome conservative thinking and departmentalism in order to implement the economic accounting system. At the beginning, when the idea of measuring warehouses and drawing maps was proposed, most cadres thought: What's the use of measuring? We just lack warehouses. Some cadres said: An estimate is enough, the warehouse is so big, it's full of goods, there's no way to measure it. After repeated mobilization, some cadres began to measure and draw maps in the warehouses and storage yards. They originally thought: Just measure with a tape measure, draw a circle if it's round, and draw a square if it's square! But when they got to the warehouse or storage yard and saw so many stacks of goods, stretching as far as the eye could see, they didn't know how to start measuring and drawing. Some who reluctantly measured also weren't accurate. At this time, the conservative thinking of some cadres resurfaced. They said, "It's easy to talk about, but hard to do. Without a background in civil engineering, there's no way to measure." The cadres participating in the measurement also felt that they had a low level of education, didn't know how to use plane tables, and hadn't studied civil engineering, so they couldn't measure. At this time, leading cadres of the pilot committee faced the masses, mobilized the masses to find tricks and think of solutions, and quickly discovered Dong Jianyi's simple measurement method. This method was simple and easy to learn, and many cadres with only a primary school education could learn it in four or five days. After the problem of measurement and drawing was solved, the conservative thinking of some cadres was severely impacted, and everyone's work confidence increased accordingly. When determining storage capacity quotas, the leadership promptly notified and commended good units and corrected the thinking of some cadres who wanted to leave more large aisles and large wall spacing to set the quotas lower so that it would be easier to complete the task during the competition, as well as the thinking of blindly increasing the height of stacks.

When discussing personnel quotas and improving stacking methods, the strength of the masses was relied upon to overcome the conservative and backward thinking of some cadres, and great achievements were made.

IV. Continued Efforts Are Needed

The Tianjin State-Owned Trade System warehouses have achieved results since the pilot implementation of economic accounting, but the idea that leading cadres should resolutely rely on all warehouse keepers and stevedores is not yet universally clear. The leading cadres of some units do not pay enough attention to the rationalization proposals of the masses, nor have they paid attention to promoting advanced working methods, which has affected the development of the work. The pilot committee (the current pilot committee has ended, and this work has been transferred to the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce) has decided, on the existing basis, in conjunction with the increased production and conservation movement, to carry out a quota competition, solve the main problems existing in the current warehouse work, further improve the warehouse utilization rate and storage capacity, simplify various procedures and systems, overcome the backlog and confusion of inventory materials, resolutely implement the economic accounting system, implement the enterprise management of warehouses, and make warehouses better serve production and material exchange.

    天津市国营贸易系统
    试行仓库经济核算制的初步成就
    沈文英
    天津市国营贸易系统自九月份试行仓库经济核算制以来，经过丈量和定额等工作，已初步了解仓库可用面积，使仓库的使用率大大增加；并且可以了解仓库内存些什么货、何时进、何时出的情况。这给仓库企业化管理创造了有利条件。
    一、仓库利用率为什么非常低
    在试行仓库经济核算制以前，天津市国营贸易系统的仓库管理人员，天天嚷着仓库不够用，要求增建仓库。但现有的仓库到底有多大，能放多少东西，谁都不知道。例如，天津市信托公司的仓库是很凌乱的，来了货就往空地方塞，先进仓的货被压在垛底下，公司来提货时，东翻西找，使仓库存货乱成一团。看起来是货物满仓，连走道也没有，实际上码垛不合标准，墙距不合标准，并没有放多少东西，仓库就“满”了。现在经过丈量，确定了可用面积，发现这些仓库的使用率只达到百分之二十四点五。天津市百货公司第三仓库过去的使用率只达百分之四十八。天津市仓库管理处所属仓库的使用率是较高的，但也不过百分之五十九。由于管理人员不了解库存情况，加以保管不善，造成了货物的严重积压和损耗，使国家财富遭受巨大的损失。天津市仓库管理处南站一码头仓库在去年九月以前就存有中国进口公司天津市公司的价值十四亿元以上的二百一十吨油毡，因为保管不周，油毡全部变质，但它所占仓位的租金，却达四千万元以上。天津市进口公司去年十二月在该仓库存有进口的测量仪器八箱，重二点二八吨，这是国家基本建设中急需的东西，但一直被积压到清理仓库以前。销货部门缺乏的某些货物，仓库内却积压了很多。天津市百货公司不断由上海调拨卷烟纸，但该公司却有卷烟纸六十六箱，在南站一码头仓库积压了将近一年。
    二、进行丈量，制定定额，改
    善仓库管理
    九月间，天津市国营贸易系统仓库在天津市国营贸易仓库企业化试行委员会领导下，试行经济核算制。这就要进行丈量、绘图，计算出仓库总面积、可用面积和主要商品的车单位面积定额。具体作法是对库房中和货场中所有的障碍物、建筑物、墙距以及库存货垛所占的面积，都进行测量，并绘制成图，比较准确地算出库房、货场的总面积。从总面积中减去障碍物、建筑物及其和货场间必要的距离的面积，再减去货物进出、装卸必须的道路和货物堆存墙距所占的面积，得出可用面积。再根据百货、工业器材、粮食、矿产等各种不同的商品情况，和麻包、纸包、席包、布包、桶装、箱装、铁皮装等不同的包装法，算出货垛与货位之间的间隔和距离（如系楼房仓库，在放货时必须计算楼房上下层负荷量的不同比例）。这样就可以初步确定每个三十吨车皮所装的各种货物，在货场、库房所占面积的定额，这就是车单位面积定额。
    天津市国营贸易系统的货场，经过丈量，总面积比今年七月份各单位上报数字多五十二万平方公尺，按主要商品的平均车单位面积计算，约可多存一万一千多车皮的货物。充分利用这些仓容，每月约可给国家节省三十四亿一千多万元。
    各单位计算出仓库可用面积和主要商品的车单位面积定额，算出仓库内可存放多少货物，根据现行的各种手续、制度、账册、表报的数量及各项工作的过程和仓库的吞吐情况，结合改进各种工作制度，制定出人员定额。有了人员定额，就可以更合理地使用人力，把多余的人员转到别的岗位上去。如天津市仓库管理处河东仓库，经过实行定额，人员可减少百分之十六。
    确定可用面积和人员定额后，进一步制定费用定额。费用定额是按照人员定额正确地计算出工资总额；再根据总的储存量定额，按照上级规定的开支标准，计算出固定资产折旧、低值及易耗品折旧费；再加上仓库的租赁费。有了费用定额后，再推算出仓库每一平方公尺的定额成本，加上合理利润，就是正当的仓租费。天津市仓库管理处实行费用定额以后，仓租费平均比过去降低了百分之三十七。
    三、主要经验是走群众路线
    天津市国营贸易系统在试行仓库企业化管理工作中获得的主要经验，就是必须紧紧依靠群众，发挥群众的智慧，坚决克服保守思想和本位主义思想，以贯彻经济核算制。在开始提出丈量仓库和绘图时，大部分干部认为：丈量有什么用？缺仓库就是缺仓库。有的干部说：估计估计就行了，这样大的仓库，货物满满的，没法量。经过反复动员，部分干部开始到库房和货场去丈量和绘图。他们原来想：反正用皮尺一量，是圆就画个圆的，是方就画个方的吧！但是到了库房或货场里，看看货垛这样多，一眼望不到头，丈量和绘图都无从下手。有的勉强丈量了，也不准确。这时某些干部的保守思想又抬头了，他们说：“谈时容易行时难，经济核算不好办。没有学过土木工程的就没法量。”参加丈量的干部也觉得自己文化水平低，不会使用平板仪，没学过土木工程，不能丈量。试行委员会领导干部这时面向群众，动员群众找窍门、想办法，很快发现了董坚毅的简便丈量法。这种方法简便易学，许多小学程度的干部，学习四五天就会了。丈量、绘图问题解决以后，某些干部的保守思想受到严重打击，大家的工作信心随之提高。在决定仓容定额时，领导方面及时通报表扬好的单位，纠正了某些干部想多留大走道大墙距，把定额定低些，在竞赛时容易完成任务，和盲目地提高码垛高度等思想。
    在讨论人员定额和改进码垛方法的时候，也依靠群众的力量，克服了某些干部的保守落后思想，得到很大的成绩。
    四、还要继续努力
    天津市国营贸易系统仓库试行经济核算以来是有成绩的，但领导干部坚决依靠全体保管员和搬运工人的思想还不是普遍明确的。某些单位的领导干部对群众的合理化建议还不够重视，也没有注意推广先进工作法，影响了工作的开展。试行委员会（现试行委员会已结束，这个工作改由市工商局领导）已决定在现有基础上，结合增产节约运动，开展定额竞赛，解决目前仓库工作中存在的主要问题，进一步提高仓库使用率和储存量，简化各种手续和制度，克服库存物资的积压和混乱现象，坚决贯彻经济核算制，实行仓库管理企业化，使仓库更好地为生产和为物资交流服务。
