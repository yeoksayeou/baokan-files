(Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd) The head of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, Tikhonov, and members Zakharov and Yefimov, held separate symposiums with Chinese cultural and scientific circles, music circles, and historical workers yesterday afternoon.

　　Tikhonov attended the symposium on Sino-Soviet cultural exchange hosted by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Those who participated in the symposium included Wu Yuzhang, Zhou Yang, Li Siguang, Zhu Kezhen, Hu Yuzhi, Hong Shen, and Chen Zhongjing. At the meeting, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke first, mentioning that the visit of Soviet cultural and art workers to various places had greatly helped China's literature, art, and scientific work. Afterwards, opinions were exchanged on literature, drama, music, fine arts, and scientific exchange. Tikhonov spoke freely about the achievements of Chinese literature and art at the meeting. He believes that Chinese literature is developing vigorously, and new works are constantly being produced. Chinese literary and art writers have personally experienced various struggles, so their works are full of vitality. Tikhonov highly praised Chinese dramatic art. He said: Chinese drama has its excellent national traditions. He elaborated on the local dramas he saw in various places during his visit. Tikhonov also talked about Chinese acrobatics. He believes that Chinese acrobatics are world-class. The symposium began at 2 p.m. and lasted for two hours, proceeding in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere from beginning to end.

　　Zakharov, at the invitation of the All-China Musicians Association, attended the music symposium. Those who participated in this symposium included Lü Ji, Chairman of the National Musicians Association, Vice Chairman Ma Sicong, and musicians Ma Ke, Li Ling, He Shide, Lao Zhicheng, Li Guoquan, Qu Xixian, Ren Hong, Jin Ziguang, and others, totaling more than twenty people. At the symposium, Zakharov, based on the various folk music performances he heard in various parts of China, expressed many valuable opinions on Chinese music work. He believes that Chinese folk music and its actors have excellent traditions and high achievements in all aspects, and this tradition and achievement should be especially respected and promoted. At the same time, he believes that China should cultivate a large number of new music talents. These two kinds of musical cultures can be developed simultaneously, and both are needed by the people. There is no need to force these two to harmonize into one thing, which is impossible and divorced from the masses of the people. He also answered the questions raised by Chinese musicians about the combination of Western musical instruments and folk musical instruments, as well as the creation of new operas, based on Soviet experience. His speech was very enlightening to Chinese musicians. The symposium continued for three hours in a pleasant and friendly atmosphere. Finally, Lü Ji, on behalf of Chinese musicians, presented Zakharov with many musical scores of excellent Chinese songs.

　　Yefimov attended a symposium jointly hosted by the Renmin University of China and the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Those who participated in the symposium included Wu Yuzhang, President of Renmin University of China, Vice President Hu Xikui, Fan Wenlan, Director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and more than ten history workers. At the symposium, Yefimov answered in detail the questions raised by the participants one by one. He first introduced the rich experience of the History Department of Leningrad University in teaching Marxism-Leninism compulsory courses to students, organizing students to carry out special assignments, using physical teaching, and organizing graduate students to conduct teaching experiments. Then, he elaborated on how Soviet history scholars carry out patriotism and internationalism education in history teaching and how to oppose reactionary cosmopolitanism. He pointed out: The expression of patriotism and internationalism in Soviet history teaching lies in making the younger generation understand the glorious history of their own nation and country, while also respecting the cultural and historical traditions of other nations and countries, and making every effort to fight against those bourgeois scholars who arbitrarily distort and insult the history of other nations, and also fighting against the phenomenon of obliterating their own historical and cultural traditions. Finally, Yefimov introduced the experience of how Soviet history scholars conduct history teaching in connection with current realities. The symposium began at 3 p.m. and ended after three hours.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency: Churaki, leader of the Soviet art troupe, and members Halima Naserova, Obraztsov, Peibutov, Yemelyanova, Kavelzneva, Sokolova, Pomazkov, Chitoshvili, Karachyova, Puchicin, Obraztsova, Zaitseva, and administrative staff Salnikov, etc., totaling fourteen people, returned to Beijing on the evening of the 3rd by Jinghu Railway train after visiting major cities in the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, and East China regions respectively.

　　吉洪诺夫等在京与我国文化工作者座谈
    楚拉基、纳赛罗娃等访问各地后返京
    【新华社三日讯】苏联文化工作者代表团团长吉洪诺夫，团员查哈罗夫、叶菲莫夫三日下午分别和我国文化科学界、音乐界和历史工作者举行座谈会。
    吉洪诺夫出席了由中苏友好协会总会主持的中苏文化交流座谈会。参加座谈的有吴玉章、周扬、李四光、竺可桢、胡愈之、洪深、陈忠经等。会上，首先由中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞发言，他谈到这次苏联文化艺术工作者访问各地，对我国文学、艺术和科学工作有很大的帮助。接着，互相交换了关于文艺、戏剧、音乐、美术和科学方面交流的意见。吉洪诺夫在会上畅谈了中国的文学艺术的成就，他认为中国文学正在蓬勃发展中，新的作品正不断地产生。中国文艺作家是亲身经历过各种斗争的，因此，他们的作品富有生气。吉洪诺夫对于中国的戏剧艺术十分赞誉。他说：中国戏剧有它的优良的民族传统。他畅述了这次在各地所看到的地方戏剧。吉洪诺夫还谈到中国的杂技。他认为中国的杂技是世界第一流的。座谈会下午二时开始，历时二小时，自始至终在友好、融洽的气氛中进行。
    查哈罗夫应中华全国音乐工作者协会的邀请，出席了音乐座谈会。参加这次座谈会的有全国音协主席吕骥，副主席马思聪和音乐家马可、李凌、何士德、老志诚、黎国荃、瞿希贤、任虹、金紫光等二十多人。在座谈会上，查哈罗夫根据他在中国各地听到的各种民间音乐的演唱，发表许多对中国音乐工作的宝贵的意见。他认为中国民间音乐和它的演员在各方面都有优秀的传统和高度的成就，这种传统和成就应该特别予以尊重和发扬，同时他认为中国应该大量培养新音乐的人材。这两种音乐文化是可以同时发展的，而且两者都是人民所需要的。不必要勉强使这两者调和成为一种东西，这样是不可能的，也是脱离人民群众的。他在会上还根据苏联的经验解答了中国音乐家所提出的关于西洋乐器和民间乐器配合以及新歌剧的创作问题。他的谈话对中国音乐家有很大的启示。座谈会在愉快友好的空气中继续了三小时。最后，吕骥代表中国音乐家以许多优秀的中国歌曲的乐谱赠送给查哈罗夫。
    叶菲莫夫出席了由中国人民大学和中国科学院近代史研究所联合主持的座谈会，参加座谈会的有中国人民大学校长吴玉章、副校长胡锡奎，中国科学院近代史研究所所长范文澜以及历史学工作者十余人。叶菲莫夫在座谈会上就与会者所提出的问题一一作了详细的解答。他首先介绍了列宁格勒大学历史系怎样在学生中教授马克思列宁主义必修课程、组织学生进行专题作业、运用实物教学和组织毕业学生进行教学实验等方面的丰富经验，接着他阐述了苏联历史学者在历史教学中如何进行爱国主义与国际主义的教育以及如何反对反动的世界主义。他指出：苏联历史教学中爱国主义和国际主义精神的表现，就在于使青年一代认识自己民族和国家的光荣历史，同时也尊重其他民族和国家的文化和历史传统，并竭力与那些任意歪曲和侮辱其他民族历史的资产阶级学者进行斗争，也和那些抹煞本国的历史文化传统的现象作斗争。叶菲莫夫最后并介绍了苏联历史学者如何联系当前实际进行历史教学的经验。座谈会下午三时开始，历时三小时结束。
