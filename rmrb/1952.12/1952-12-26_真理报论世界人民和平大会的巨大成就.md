Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd: "Pravda" published an editorial on December 22nd entitled "The Will of the People of the World to Fight for Peace is Indestructible," stating: The World People's Peace Congress has closed in Vienna. For eight days, the attention of hundreds of millions of people has been focused on Vienna, following the progress of the Congress with hope. All the important issues in the hearts of peace-loving people around the world were widely discussed at the Congress.

Such a gathering, uniting representatives of people with various different views and beliefs under the sacred and lofty will to defend universal peace, is unprecedented in the world. 1,857 delegates from 85 countries participated in the Congress. Many delegates overcame great difficulties to come to Vienna. The unwavering will of the people of the world to fight for peace proved to be stronger than the imperialists' attempts to sabotage the Congress.

A characteristic of the Vienna Congress was that the participants included representatives of almost all strata of people from almost all countries in the world. The Vienna Congress clearly demonstrated to all honest people that political, economic, and religious differences are unimportant when there is agreement on such an extremely important issue as peace.

The results of the Congress are concisely and clearly embodied in its declaration. This historical document proves the unwavering will of the people of all countries to fight for peace. In its appeal to the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, and France, the Congress expressed the demands of all peace-loving humanity, urging these five governments to consult with each other to conclude a peace pact.

The editorial emphasized: The Soviet people warmly welcome and support the documents adopted by the Congress. They feel that these documents express the good wishes of hundreds of millions of people fighting for peace. As Stalin said, the interests of the Soviet Union are inseparable from the cause of world peace. Another powerful proof of this is the decision announced on the 21st regarding the awarding of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" to another group of outstanding peace fighters representing the democratic forces of various countries. The World People's Peace Congress marks another step forward in the struggle for international peace and against the instigators of war. There is no doubt that the Congress's declaration to the people of all countries will receive a warm response from hundreds of millions of good people in all countries.

    真理报论世界人民和平大会的巨大成就
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二十二日以“世界各国人民争取和平的意志是坚不可摧的”为题发表社论说：世界人民和平大会已在维也纳闭幕了。八天来，亿万人民的注意力集中在维也纳，他们怀着希望，注意大会的工作进程。所有爱好和平人民心中的重要问题，都在大会上作了广泛的讨论。
    具有各种不同的见解和信仰的人们的代表，团结在保卫普遍和平的神圣而崇高的意志下，举行这种集会，这在世界上还是空前的。参加大会的有来自八十五个国家的一千八百五十七位代表。许多代表克服了很大的困难，才得以来到维也纳。世界各国人民争取和平的不可动摇的意志，证明是比帝国主义者破坏大会的企图更强有力。
    维也纳大会的一个特点是：参加大会的人们包括差不多世界所有国家的几乎所有阶层人民的代表。维也纳大会向所有正直的人们清楚地表明：只要在对和平这样极端重要的问题上意见是一致的时候，政治、经济和宗教的分歧就显得不重要了。
    大会的工作结果简要而明确地体现在它的宣言里。这个历史文件证明了世界各国人民争取和平的不可动摇的意志。大会在向美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、大不列颠和法国五国政府的呼吁中表达了全体爱好和平人类的要求，敦促这五国政府进行协商，以缔结和平公约。
    社论强调写道：苏联人民热烈欢迎并拥护大会所通过的各项文件。他们感到，这些文件表达了为和平而斗争的亿万人民的善良愿望。正如斯大林所说的，苏联的利益和世界和平事业是分不开的。在这方面的另一个有力的证明，便是二十一日发表的关于以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金发给代表世界各国民主力量的另一批卓越的和平战士的决定。世界人民和平大会标志着：为争取国际和平与反对战争制造者而进行的斗争更迈进了一步。毫无疑问，大会致世界各国人民的宣言将获得各国亿万善良人民的热烈响应。
