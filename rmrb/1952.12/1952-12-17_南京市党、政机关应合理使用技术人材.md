    Nanjing Municipal Party and Government Organs Should Rationally Use Technical Talents

    To the Editor: After reading Comrade Wang Jie's article entitled "Adjust Specialized Technical Talents with a Correct Attitude," published in the People's Daily on November 27th, we collectively discussed it in our study group, relating it to our own actual situations. In the end, everyone agreed that we are technical cadres, but we are not doing technical work, and we should request to be transferred to technical work positions.

    We twelve people have all received university education in science and engineering. Among them, eight studied electrical engineering, two studied civil engineering, and one each studied mechanical engineering and chemistry. Some of us even worked in our respective fields for one to two years after graduating. After liberation, we were assigned to work in Party, Youth League, trade union, and public security organs. We are all Party and Youth League members. We believe that such job assignments were completely correct in the early days of liberation. This May, after we saw the People's Daily publish articles on the rational use of specialized technical talents and criticizing the departmentalism of some organs' leaders, most of us raised our opinions with our leaders, hoping to be transferred to technical work positions that align with our studies, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions. In August of this year, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred us to work in the office of the Enterprise Management Committee. In fact, this work does not require technical personnel. At the time, we recognized that this organization was newly established and temporarily lacked cadres, so in order to meet the current needs, we still worked diligently and actively. However, we believe that in the context of the nation entering large-scale economic construction and the extreme shortage of technical talents, this way of assigning our work is a waste of manpower and is detrimental to the country's economic construction. We hope to be assigned to technical work (or study) positions. At the same time, we have assured the branch that we will definitely work hard to do our current work well before we are transferred; and we will improve our political and ideological level in the current rectification study.

    In addition, according to our understanding, similar situations of mismatch between studies and application are also very common in Nanjing. For example, Comrade Zhou Tongyun, who studied physics, is now doing secretarial work in the Municipal Party Committee. Comrade Li Zhengbang, who studied mathematics, originally worked in the Education Section of the Cadre School and has now been transferred to work in the Rectification Office. Comrade Feng Zimin, who studied electrical engineering, is now the head of the Education Section of the Culture and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Comrade Liu Shousheng, who studied mechanical engineering, is now the Deputy Section Chief of the Wage Section of the Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee. In August of this year, Comrade Zhou Zhaochang, a graduate of the Agricultural Engineering Department of Nanjing University, was even assigned to work in the Municipal Public Security Bureau. We believe that such a situation is not in line with the spirit of the rational use of specialized technical talents, and we hope that it will be checked and corrected in a timely manner.

    Editor's Note: The opinions raised by readers Lu Ping and others are correct. The Nanjing Municipal Party and Government leading organs should obey the current needs of the country and assign these technical talents to the positions most needed by the construction of the motherland. We hope that the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government will conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation and correct this unreasonable phenomenon of using technical talents in a timely manner.

    南京市党、政机关应合理使用技术人材
    编辑同志：人民日报十一月二十七日刊载了王杰同志题为“以正确态度调整专门技术人材”的一篇文章，我们集体阅读后，在学习小组会上，联系自己的实际情况，进行了讨论。最后大家的意见是：我们是技术干部，但没有做技术工作，应该要求调到技术工作岗位上去。
    我们十二个人都曾受过大学理、工科的教育。其中学电机工程的八人，土木工程的二人，机械工程和化学的各一人；有的从学校毕业后，还做过本行技术工作一年到两年。解放后我们被分配在党、团、工会及公安机关工作。我们都是党、团员。我们认为解放初期，这样分配工作是完全正确的。今年五月，我们看到人民日报发表了合理使用专门技术人材和批评某些机关领导本位主义思想的文章后，我们大部都向自己领导上提过意见，希望能按中央指示的精神，调到与自己所学相结合的技术工作岗位上去。今年八月，中共南京市委员会把我们调到企业管理委员会办公室工作。事实上这个工作并不需要技术人员。当时我们认识到，这一机构是刚成立的，
    一时缺乏干部，为了服从当前的需要，我们还是安心地积极地工作着。但是我们认为，在全国即将进入大规模经济建设，技术人材非常缺乏的情况下，这样来分配我们的工作，是人力的浪费，是对国家经济建设不利的。希望将我们分配到技术工作（或学习）岗位上去。同时我们已向支部保证：在没有调动工作之前，我们一定努力做好现在的工作；并在目前进行的整党学习中，提高自己的政治思想水平。
    此外，据我们了解，类似的学用不一致的情况，在南京也很普遍。像学物理的周同云同志，现在市委做秘书工作。学数学的李正邦同志，原在干部学校教育科工作，现被调到整党办公室工作。学电机的冯子敏同志，现在市总工会文教部教育科任科长。学机械的刘寿生同志，现在市人民政府财政经济委员会工资科任副科长。今年八月，南京大学农业工程系毕业的周照常同志，还被分配在本市公安局工作。我们认为这样的情况，是和合理使用专门技术人材的精神不合的，希望及时检查纠正。

    编者按：读者鲁平等所提的意见是正确的。南京市党、政领导机关应该服从当前国家的需要，将这些技术人材分配到祖国建设最需要的岗位上去。我们希望中共南京市委会和南京市人民政府进行一次全面、彻底的调查，及时纠正这种使用技术人材不合理的现象。
