    Yichun Forest Industry Bureau Strengthens Fire Prevention Work
    Editor: The criticism made by Comrades Zhao Dexin, Zhang Qingsong, and Sun Ping regarding the neglect of forest protection and fire prevention work in the Yichun Forest Area, published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on November 12th, is entirely correct. Our bureau has already examined and corrected this problem, and the responsible personnel involved have been re-punished. We are now informing you of the process of our handling:
    1. On November 20th, our bureau convened an emergency meeting including Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League representatives to discuss the issue of improving organizational structures. The meeting decided to assign five strong cadres (previously holding concurrent positions) to establish a fire prevention command. Each branch bureau will designate a section-level cadre to focus specifically on fire prevention work. Each work unit will add one fire prevention officer.
    2. On November 22nd, the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau formed six groups, each consisting of five people, to conduct thorough fire prevention inspections at the branch bureau sites. The relevant personnel responsible for causing the fire have already been punished, but we have re-punished them.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    伊春森林工业管理局加强防火工作
    编辑同志：十一月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登的赵德信、张青松、孙屏等同志对我伊春林区提出的关于忽视护林防火工作的批评，是完全正确的。我局已经检查和纠正了这个问题，并对有关的负责人员给予重新处分。现把我们处理的经过告诉你们：
    一、我局在十一月二十日召开了包括党、行政、工会、青年团的紧急会议，讨论健全组织机构的问题。会议决定：抽出五名坚强干部（以前兼职），成立防火指挥部。各分局指定股级干部，专作防火工作。每个作业所增设防火干事一名。
    二、十一月二十二日伊春森林工业管理局组成六个组，每组五个人，赴各分局现场进行周密的防火大检查。造成火灾的有关人员本已受到处分，我们又从新给予处分。
    伊春森林工业管理局机关办公室
