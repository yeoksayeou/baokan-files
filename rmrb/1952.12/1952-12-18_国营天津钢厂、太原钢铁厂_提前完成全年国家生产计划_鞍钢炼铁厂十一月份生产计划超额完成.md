State-owned Tianjin Steel Plant and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have completed the annual national production plan ahead of schedule and are striving to complete the annual production increase and conservation plan.

    The state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant completed the annual production tasks (national plan) for various major products as early as mid-October. As of mid-November, the plant completed the annual production plan exceeding the national task. Among them, the output of wire rod exceeded the national task by 125%, and the output of steel bars exceeded the national task by 130%. On the basis of completing the annual national task, the plant leadership, according to the national control task for next year, mobilized all forces in an organized and led manner to mobilize all employees to compile the 1953 production, finance, and technology plan. Through the compilation of the plan, the plant employees extensively and deeply carried out the rationalization proposal movement around the key issues in production, further tapped the potential capacity of the enterprise, and tried their best to ensure the completion of the annual production increase and conservation plan for this year, laying a good foundation for further development of production next year.

    As of December 2, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the main workshops of the whole plant, overfulfilled the national production plan ahead of schedule. Steel ingot production completed 100.49% of the annual production plan, pig iron production completed 112.24%, medium-sized steel billets and steel production completed 120.03%, and small-sized steel and metallurgical coke production also overfulfilled the plan. The main reason for the plant's achievements mentioned above is that in the autumn patriotic production increase and conservation competition and the winter investigation work, the valuable suggestions of Soviet experts were vigorously implemented, and the potential capacity was tapped. For example, after the employees of the steelmaking department implemented the "Five Major Operation Methods" instructed by Soviet experts, the scrap rate of steel ingots was reduced from 4.6% in the second quarter to 0.2% by the beginning of October. The employees of the steelmaking department actively implemented the "fast steelmaking method" in the investigation work; the technical personnel and workers combined, and the suggestion of labor model Wang Guiying to add small steel water bags was successful after testing, which increased the steel output per square meter of hearth area from 4.81 tons to 5.03 tons, and increased the steel ingot output by 11%, which made an important guarantee for the department to complete the production plan and the production increase and conservation plan. Now, the employees of the plant are striving to overfulfill the annual production increase and conservation plan.

    Furthermore, the employees of the iron smelting plant of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company actively promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." In November, they completed the tasks assigned by the state three days and ten hours ahead of schedule, and completed the November production increase and conservation task three days and nine hours ahead of schedule. It is estimated that it overfulfilled the national plan by 113.56%, and the production increase and conservation task by 98.05%, eliminated extra iron, and created a record month with high output and good quality since the plant's opening. The employees of the plant guarantee to further study and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, strive to complete the annual production task and the production increase and conservation plan in an all-round way four days ahead of schedule, and report the good news to Chairman Mao as soon as possible.

    国营天津钢厂、太原钢铁厂
    提前完成全年国家生产计划
    鞍钢炼铁厂十一月份生产计划超额完成
    国营天津钢厂、太原钢铁厂已提前完成全年国家生产计划，正为完成全年增产节约计划而努力。
    国营天津钢厂，早在十月中旬已提前完成今年各种主要产品的全年生产任务（国家计划），截至十一月中旬止，该厂即完成了超过国家任务的全年厂订生产计划，其中盘条的产品超过国家任务百分之一百二十五，钢条的产量超过国家任务百分之一百三十。在完成全年国家任务的基础上，该厂领导方面已根据国家明年的控制任务，动员全部力量，有组织、有领导地发动全体职工，编制一九五三年生产财务技术计划。通过编制计划，该厂职工围绕生产中的关键问题，广泛深入地开展了合理化建议运动，进一步挖掘企业中的潜在能力，尽力保证完成今年全年的增产节约计划，为明年进一步发展生产打下良好基础。
    太原钢铁厂到十二月二日止，全厂各主要车间提前超额完成了国家生产计划任务。钢锭生产完成了全年生产计划的百分之一百点四九，生铁生产完成了百分之一百一十二点二四，中型钢坯、钢材生产完成了百分之一百二十点零三，小型钢材、冶金焦生产也都超额完成了计划。该厂获得上述成绩的主要原因，是在秋季爱国增产节约竞赛运动中和冬季的查定工作中，大力贯彻执行了苏联专家的宝贵建议，挖掘了潜在能力。如炼钢部职工执行了苏联专家指示的“五大操作法”以后，到十月上旬钢锭报废率由第二季度的百分之四点六降低到百分之零点二。炼钢部职工在查定工作中，积极贯彻“快速炼钢法”；技术人员和工人结合，劳动模范王贵英增设小钢水包建议经试验成功，使平炉由每平方公尺炉底面积出钢四点八一吨提高到五点零三吨，钢锭产量提高了百分之十一，使该部完成生产计划和增产节约计划有了重要保证。现在，该厂职工正为争取超额完成全年增产节约计划而奋斗。
    又讯：国营鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂职工在“中苏友好月”中，积极推广苏联先进经验，十一月份提前三天零十小时完成了国家所给的任务，并提前三天零九小时完成了十一月份增产节约任务。计超额完成国家计划的百分之一百一十三点五六，增产节约任务百分之九十八点零五，消灭了号外铁，创造该厂开炉以来产量高质量好的纪录月。该厂职工保证进一步努力学习与推广苏联先进经验，争取提前四天全面完成全年生产任务与增产节约计划，早日给毛主席报喜。
