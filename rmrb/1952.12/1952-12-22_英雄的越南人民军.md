    The Heroic Vietnam People's Army
    Vietnam Chang Shan
    The Vietnam People's Army has been eight years old since its birth. Although it is still young, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, and relying on the infinite strength of the people, it has grown rapidly.
    In September 1940, the French colonialists allowed the Japanese fascist bandits to occupy Indochina. At that time, a guerrilla team of twelve Vietnamese people fired the first shot of the uprising in Beishan. On December 22, 1944, the predecessor of the Vietnam People's Army—the Vietnam People's Liberation Army Propaganda Team—was established in the Chen Xingdao forest area (located on the border of Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn provinces) under the slogan of "Anti-French and Expel Japan." At the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army captured Na Ngan and Pai Ke in Bac Can Province, and initially established military exploits. Afterwards, it rapidly expanded in six provinces of North Vietnam and established anti-Japanese base areas. In August 1945, the Soviet army defeated the Japanese Kwantung Army, and Japanese imperialism was forced to surrender. The Vietnamese people thus obtained the conditions for an armed general uprising. At that time, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army advanced south and quickly captured Taiyuan City, the capital of Taiyuan Province. Later, amid the warm cheers of the people, it entered Hanoi. This Vietnamese people's army was the backbone of the Vietnam People's Army at its initial establishment.
    After expelling the Japanese aggressors, the young People's Army then shouldered the anti-aggression war against the French colonialists and American interventionists, and grew stronger in the struggle. In the test of defending the motherland and the people's democratic system, thousands of model soldiers loved by the people emerged.
    The 24-year-old combat hero Qu Zheng Lan said when requesting to join the army, "We can all make contributions to the people in any job. I am young and strong, and I want to join the People's Army to directly eliminate the enemy." Many outstanding young people who joined the Vietnam People's Army held this common aspiration.
    Qu Zheng Lan practiced his simple promise. From his first appearance on the battlefield to his glorious sacrifice, he made outstanding military exploits in every battle. In the Jiang Mang battle of the Hoa Binh campaign in the winter of 1951, he stepped forward to chase and fight tanks on Highway 6. He jumped onto the tank three times and finally opened the tank's hatch with perseverance, using hand grenades to destroy the tank and wipe out all the enemy troops inside the tank.
    The Vietnam People's Army soldiers fought selflessly to annihilate the enemy's vital forces, determined to complete their tasks. The young combat hero Luo Wenqiu once led a blasting team to attack the enemy's bunker. All the members of the team were sacrificed, and his own arm was broken. He endured the pain and chopped off his arm that hindered movement, and advanced with explosives in one hand, destroying the enemy's bunker and completing the task.
    Due to his love for the motherland and the people, Nguyen Thi Xan, a girl from a hired peasant background, was tempered in the flames of war and became a brave and resourceful guerrilla commander. She took the lead in every battle. Once she captured a French captain alive with her bare hands.
    Combat hero Nguyen Quoc Tri participated in 95 battles in seven years, personally annihilating about 200 enemy troops. He was originally a member of the anti-Japanese guerrilla team and is now a commander of the regular People's Army. In the border campaign in the winter of 1950, he led a team to pursue the fleeing French army and made contributions in the battle to encircle and annihilate two French Foreign Legion regiments. In the summer of 1951, in the battles in the three provinces of Hà Nam, Nam Định and Ninh Bình, he calmly commanded the team under enemy aircraft bombing and artillery bombardment, and captured He Xich Mountain, which was occupied by the French army. Once, he and two soldiers captured a company of enemy troops. In the Hoa Binh campaign, he led his team to attack the enemy stronghold of Xiuwu. In this battle, he commanded the soldiers to destroy about 100 meters of deep barbed wire. He himself was seriously injured and continued to command the charge until the battle was completely victorious before leaving the front line.
    These combat heroes, like other People's Army soldiers, are outstanding sons and daughters of the working people. Before joining the army, Qu Zheng Lan was an agricultural model, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of a working people who had turned over from the cruel oppression of imperialism and feudalism. Nguyen Quoc Tri was a shepherd boy in his childhood and participated in agricultural labor from the age of thirteen. When he grew up, he was sentenced to imprisonment by the French colonialists for evading corvée. His father was also imprisoned for resisting French imperialism. He harbored a deep hatred for the enemy. Luo Wenqiu was a poor young man whose father died early and was forced to leave his hometown, only returning home after the victory of the "August Revolution". Once he was injured in front of the enemy's stronghold, and he thought of his past poor life while in a coma. After waking up, he became more determined to complete the task. Nguyen Thi Xan was a girl from the poorest hired peasant family in the village, and her entire childhood was spent as a hired worker. In March 1945, her mother and sister both starved to death. Her brother took care of the landlord's cattle and was blinded by the cattle's horns. The "August Revolution" changed her life, but French aggressors came to invade her hometown again. She often said: "The people of my hometown are currently under the claws of imperialism, and their lives are very painful, and women are even more ravaged. I am determined to fight to the end."
    These heroic People's Army soldiers were cultivated by President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party. Nguyen Thi Xan said: "The Party taught me and pointed out why I suffer and for whom I fight. The small progress I have made depends on Uncle Ho's education. He taught me how to write letters, kill enemies with guns, hate enemies, and be able to see a bright future. I will never forget the kindness of Uncle Ho and the Party."
    The Vietnam People's Army soldiers fighting for national independence are also fighting for the cause of maintaining world peace. Vietnam People's Army combat heroes Nguyen Quoc Tri and Nguyen Thi Xan participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference this year. On the second anniversary of the Korean people's anti-aggression war, Luo Wenqiu, Nguyen Thi Xan and Nguyen Quoc Tri jointly wrote a letter to the Korean People's Army to pay their respects and congratulate the Korean people on the victory of their anti-aggression war.
    With the development of the liberation war situation, more combat heroes will emerge in the Vietnam People's Army. Under the banner of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam People's Army is constantly giving heavier blows to the French colonialists and American interventionists, and is advancing towards the road to final victory!

    英雄的越南人民军
    越南  长山
    越南人民军自诞生到今天已有八年了，它虽然还年幼，但在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的英明领导下，依靠着人民的无穷力量，它很快地壮大起来了。
    一九四○年九月，法国殖民者让日本法西斯匪徒占领了印度支那，那时，一支由十二个人组成的越南人民的游击队在北山发出了第一响起义的枪声。一九四四年十二月二十二日，越南人民军的前身——越南人民解放军宣传队，在“反法驱日”的口号下，在陈兴道的森林区（位于高平和谅山两省的边境）成立。一九四四年底和一九四五年初，越南人民解放军攻下了北?省的那银与排渴，初立战功，其后，在北越的六个省迅速扩展，建立了抗日根据地。一九四五年八月，苏军击溃了日本关东军，日本帝国主义被迫投降，越南人民因此获得了武装总起义的条件。当时越南人民解放军向南推进，迅速攻下了太原省省会太原城，其后在人民群众的热烈欢呼声中，开进了河内。这支越南人民的军队就是越南人民军初成立时的骨干队伍。
    年青的人民军在驱逐了日本侵略者以后，接着又肩负了抗击法国殖民者和美国干涉者的反侵略战争，并在斗争中日益壮大起来，在保卫祖国和人民民主制度的考验中，涌现出成千成万的为人民所热爱的模范战士。
    二十四岁的战斗英雄瞿正澜在请求参军时说过，“我们无论在那个工作岗位上都可以为人民立功。我还年青力壮，我要参加人民军直接去消灭敌人。”许许多多参加越南人民军的优秀青年，就是抱着这个共同的志愿的。
    瞿正澜实践了他的纯朴的诺言。从在战场上初试锋芒到光荣牺牲为止，他在每次战斗中都立下了卓越的战功。一九五一年冬，在和平战役的江莽战斗中，他在第六号公路上挺身追打坦克，他先后跃上坦克三次，不屈不挠地终于把坦克的车盖揭开，用手榴弹把坦克炸毁，歼灭了坦克内的全部敌军。
    越南人民军战士为歼灭敌人的有生力量而忘我地战斗，决心完成自己的任务。青年战斗英雄罗文求有一次率领一个爆破组去袭击敌军的地堡。全组组员都牺牲了，他自己的手臂也被打断了，他忍痛砍下那妨碍动作的手臂，独手抱着炸药前进，炸毁了敌军的地堡，完成任务。
    由于热爱祖国、热爱人民，一个雇农出身的姑娘阮氏膻，在战火中锻炼成为一个勇敢、机智的游击队指挥员。她在每次战斗中，都带头冲杀。有一次她赤手空拳活捉了一名法军上尉。
    战斗英雄阮国治，在七年中参加战斗九十五次，个人歼灭敌军约两百名。他原来是抗日游击队队员，现在是人民军正规部队的一个指挥员。在一九五○年冬的边界战役，他率领一支队伍追击败逃的法军，在围歼法军两个外籍兵团的战斗中立过功。一九五一年夏，在河南、南定和宁平三省的战斗中，他在敌人的飞机轰炸和大炮轰击下镇静地指挥队伍，攻下了法军盘踞的鹤膝山。还有一次，他和两个战士一起，俘掳了敌军一个连。在和平战役中，他率领他的队伍进攻敌军据点修武。在这次战斗中，他指挥战士炸毁纵深的铁丝网约一百公尺。他自己身负重伤还继续指挥冲锋，直到这一战斗达到完全胜利才下火线。
    这些战斗英雄和其他人民军战士们一样，都是劳动人民的优秀儿女。瞿正澜在参军前是一位农业模范，他充分表现出一个从帝国主义和封建主义的残酷压迫下翻身起来的劳动人民的英雄气概。阮国治在幼年时代是一个牧童，十三岁起就参加农业劳动。长大后因逃避伕役而被法国殖民者判处徒刑。他的父亲也因反抗法帝国主义被关进牢狱。他对敌人怀着不共戴天的深仇。罗文求是个穷苦的青年，父亲早逝，被迫离开家乡，直到“八月革命”胜利后才重返家园。有一次他在敌人据点的前面受伤，他昏迷中还想到过去的穷苦生活，清醒来后他更坚定了要完成任务的决心。阮氏膻是村里最穷苦的雇农家庭出身的姑娘，她的整个童年时代都作雇工。一九四五年三月间，她的母亲和姐姐都饿死了。她的哥哥替地主看牛，被牛角戳瞎了眼睛。“八月革命”改变了她的生活，但法国侵略者又来侵犯她的家乡。她常常说：“我家乡的人民目前正处在帝国主义的魔爪下，他们的生活是十分痛苦的，妇女更是备受蹂躏。我决心奋斗到底。”
    这些英勇的人民战士，是胡志明主席和越南劳动党培养的。阮氏膻说：“党教导我，指出我为什么受苦，为谁而战斗。我得到的些微的进步都是依靠胡伯伯的教育。他使我懂得执笔写信，拿枪杀敌，懂得仇恨敌人，能够看到美好的前途，我永远忘不了胡伯伯和党的恩惠。”
    为民族独立而斗争的越南人民军战士们，也正为着维护世界和平的事业而奋斗。越南人民军战斗英雄阮国治和阮氏膻，今年参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。在朝鲜人民反侵略战争两周年纪念日，罗文求、阮氏膻和阮国治曾联名写信向朝鲜人民军致敬，祝贺朝鲜人民反侵略战争的胜利。
    随着解放战争形势的发展，越南人民军将会出现更多的战斗英雄。在胡志明主席的旗帜下，越南人民军正不断地予法国殖民者和美国干涉者以更沉重的打击，向着最后胜利的道路迈进！
