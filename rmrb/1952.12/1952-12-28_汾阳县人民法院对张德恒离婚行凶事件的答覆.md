    Reply from Fenyang County People's Court Regarding the Zhang Deheng Divorce Assault Incident

    Editor,

    The opinion expressed by reader Jiang Song in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on December 1st, "Suggestions for Fenyang County People's Court to Inspect the Implementation of the Marriage Law," is very correct. The Zhang Deheng incident of assault due to divorce, mentioned in the article, has been finally dealt with during the judicial reform movement. In August, after the incident of Ma Fengjin's ex-husband Zhang Deheng's assault, when the village people's government sent the perpetrator to the district people's government for handling, secretary Tian Kaixiong, without a detailed investigation, listened to Zhang Deheng's one-sided account and concluded: "Ma Fengjin owes people money and refuses to pay, deliberately creating trouble." And said to Ma Fengjin: "You have caused him (Zhang Deheng) to lose both money and people, what else do you want?" In the letter introducing the incident to our court, Tian Kaixiong emphasized "grain dispute." However, the issue of assault was not clearly introduced. When it reached our court, our court cadre Li Shuangjia (incorrectly written as Li Kaiji in the original text) also carelessly released the perpetrator. When the masses sent the perpetrator to our court again for handling, our court still dealt with it with a bureaucratic attitude and released the perpetrator again. In September, the local Party branch and the village women's federation, accepting the opinions of the masses, launched a discussion on this incident and unanimously expressed their determination to struggle for the implementation of the Marriage Law, and jointly requested the county women's federation to help resolve the issue. Only then did our court send cadres to the local area to investigate the truth and arrest the perpetrator. On November 6th, our court convened a mass meeting of more than three hundred people from eleven villages in the district, and the relevant cadres made self-criticisms at the meeting and organized the masses to discuss the matter. Everyone unanimously believed that Ma Fengjin's divorce was completely correct. Some village cadres also made self-criticisms at the meeting for their past erroneous attitudes towards marriage issues. Finally, based on the opinions of the masses, our court sentenced Zhang Deheng to one and a half years of imprisonment and awarded the woman four mu of land and two sheep that she should take away. The masses reflected that such a handling was correct.

### 汾阳县人民法院对张德恒离婚行凶事件的答覆

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    汾阳县人民法院对张德恒离婚行凶事件的答覆
    编辑同志：十二月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载读者蒋松“建议汾阳县人民法院检查执行婚姻法的情况”的意见，是非常正确的。文中提到的张德恒为离婚而行凶的事件，在司法改革运动中已经作了最后处理。八月里，马凤金前夫张德恒行凶的事件发生后，村人民政府把该犯送区人民政府处理时，秘书田开雄未经详细调查，听了张德恒一面之言，即认为：“马凤金欠人钱不给，故意找岔子。”并对马凤金说：“你闹得他（张德恒）人财两空，还要怎样？”田开雄把该事件介绍给我院的信上着重写明：“粮食纠纷”。而对行凶问题，则没有介绍清楚。到了我院，我院干部李双甲（原文误为李开吉）也马马虎虎地就把该犯放回去了。经群众再一次把该犯送我院处理时，我院仍然以官僚主义态度对付，并把该犯又放回去。九月里，当地党支部和村民主妇女联合会接受群众意见，对这一事件展开了讨论，一致表示要为贯彻婚姻法而斗争，联名要求县民主妇女联合会帮助解决，才转由我院派干部到当地查明真相，把该犯扣捕。我院于十一月六日在该区召开了十一个村三百多人的群众大会，有关干部在大会上作了检讨，并组织群众讨论。大家一致认为马凤金离婚是完全正确的。有的村干部还在大会上检讨了过去对待婚姻问题的错误态度。最后，我院根据群众意见判处张德恒有期徒刑一年半，并判给女方应带走的地四亩、羊两只。群众反映，这样的处理才是正确的。
