    The Wuhan First Cotton Mill, a large-scale textile factory newly built by the Chinese people, has now started production. Construction of the factory began at the end of June 1951, and the installation of textile machinery began in April 1952. Some machines were put into operation in June. With the intensive work of building, installing, and producing simultaneously, the factory construction has been basically completed, and tens of thousands of spindles have been put into operation successively. The thousands of workers in this factory are mostly newly trained by the factory itself, and they have mastered relatively advanced operating techniques.
    The factory covers an area of more than 23,000 square meters, and all the equipment is the latest. All textile machines are products made in China. Among them are transformers and oil switches manufactured in Shanghai and Hunan, cotton cleaners manufactured in North China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, and carding machines, drawing frames, roving frames, spinning frames, winding machines, reeling machines, and baling machines manufactured in East China, North China, Southwest China, and Central South China. These domestically produced machines are not only highly productive, but also have many significant improvements over the old textile machinery. For example, the winding machine and reeling machine are equipped with automatic tube conveying belts and automatic stopping and measuring devices, which the past textile machines did not have.
    The working conditions in this factory are very good, and the factory buildings have high heat insulation and fire resistance performance. In the main workshops, there are cooling fans, heating pipes, and sprayers to adjust air, temperature, and humidity. The spinning room is equipped with a return air duct that replaces the air four times per hour. Each workshop has drinking water rooms, changing rooms, toilets, and automatic fire extinguishers. Workers have a large canteen that can accommodate thousands of people, and they live in beautiful and solid single and double dormitories. Female workers with children can leave their children to nannies to take care of them while they are at work, and they only need to go to the breastfeeding room on time to feed them. In addition, the factory is equipped with a clinic, a collective bathhouse, and a children's school. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新建的国营武汉第一棉纺厂业已开工生产
    一所规模宏大的、我国人民新建的纺织工厂——国营武汉第一棉纺厂现已开工生产。该厂从一九五一年六月底动工建造，一九五二年四月开始安装纺机设备，六月就有一部分机器开工生产。在一面建筑、一面安装、一面生产的紧张工作下，到现在建厂工程已基本完成，几万个纺锭已先后转动起来。这个工厂的几千个工人大都是新近由本厂培养训练出来的，他们已掌握了较先进的操作技术。
    该厂面积共二万三千余平方公尺，一切设备都是最新式的。全部纺织机器都是我国自制的产品。其中有上海和湖南制造的变压器和油电门，有华北、西南和西北地区制造的清花机，有华东、华北、西南和中南区制造的梳棉机、并条机、粗纱机、细纱机、筒子机、摇纱机和打包机。这些国内自制的机器，不仅生产效能很高，而且比旧的纺织机械有许多重大的改进。如筒子机和摇纱机上都装置有自动输管带和自动停车、计量的设备，这是过去的纺织机器所没有的。
    这个工厂的劳动条件很好，厂房具有高度的隔热和耐燃效能。在各主要车间内，都装有冷风机、暖气管和喷雾器等调节空气、温度和湿度的设备，细纱间内装置着每小时换气四次的回风道。各车间都有饮水间、更衣室、厕所和自动灭火器等设备。工人们吃饭有可以容纳上千人的大食堂，住宿有一幢幢漂亮而结实的单人和双人宿舍。有孩子的女工上班时，可以把孩子交给保姆照管，自己只要按时到哺儿室去喂奶就行。此外，厂内并设有医疗所、集体浴室和子弟学校。（新华社）
