    "Returned to His Own Home"
    -- An Account of Volunteer Army Combat Hero's Visit to Military Dependent Bai Yuzhen
    Lu Guangze
    On October 19th, ten Volunteer Army combat heroes who returned to China to participate in the National Day celebrations visited Bai Yuzhen, a military dependent of the Volunteer Army in Zheng Huangqi Village, western suburbs of Beijing.
    Zheng Huangqi Village is located close to the Western Hills, and the morning sun bathed it in golden light. Before the heroes even got out of the car, the villagers, men, women, old, and young, surged forward, surrounding the car tightly. An old military dependent grabbed the hand of anti-aircraft hero Liang Zhenlong, pulled him from the car, and stroked the medals on his chest, saying, "Seeing you is like seeing my son return!" The hero helped the old woman as they walked, saying, "Seeing you, madam, is like seeing my own parents."
    Amidst the laughter, a young woman wearing a brand-new dark blue outfit, with a kind demeanor and steady bearing, appeared in the crowd. Unable to shake hands with every hero, she held the hands of several heroes with both of hers, smiling and saying, "You must be so happy to return to your own home! Xiao Lan (her eldest daughter) has been looking forward to the return of the Volunteer Army uncles every day, and today she finally got to see them!"
    This was Bai Yuzhen, the comrade whom the heroes had come to visit. She is a young and outstanding Communist Party member. Since her husband, Lin Guoquan, went abroad to fight, despite the difficulties of a shortage of labor, she has not only built her family into a beautiful and happy one, but has also set an example in every movement called for by the government, leading the masses and working tirelessly. The people of the whole village elected her as the deputy village chief and recommended her as a representative of the Beijing People's Congress. How could she not be happy to see so many heroes who fought alongside her husband! While smiling and inquiring about the situation at the front, she led the heroes to her home.
    It was two tile-roofed bungalows. The courtyard was swept clean, and everything was neatly arranged. Under the eaves were large piles of sweet potatoes and basket after basket of corn, and a fat pig slept in the pigsty. She pointed to the pile of sweet potatoes and said, "These are prepared for the fat pig." An old villager next to her interjected, "Comrade, our lives are much better than in the past. When the Kuomintang was in power, it was difficult for people to even eat sweet potato leaves; now we use sweet potatoes to feed pigs. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, and it is the credit of the comrades who fought against American imperialism to protect us, enabling us to carry out production smoothly." Bai Yuzhen led the heroes into her house, which was clean and fresh. Several floral quilts were stacked on the bed. She excitedly poured tea, offered cigarettes, and arranged for everyone to sit down; while pointing to the house, she said, "This house, grain, and land were all brought to us by Chairman Mao." She took out the good news reports, letters from home, and photos sent back by Comrade Lin Guoquan for the comrades to see. Anti-aircraft hero Liang Zhenlong, upon seeing the unit number on the letter, said happily, "Comrade Lin Guoquan and I are in the same unit. When I go back this time, I must find him and tell him about seeing you." Then, he introduced, "Their regiment is a heroic regiment, and they fought many beautiful battles. Comrade Lin Guoquan has also performed meritorious service. You are truly a heroic couple!"
    Can we eat green vegetables on the Korean front? Are the cotton clothes thick enough? How long does it take for the things sent from the motherland to arrive? Bai Yuzhen and the military dependents asked these questions in great detail. Hero Guo Jinsheng said, "On the Korean front, we also have green vegetables to eat. Our green vegetables grow under the fire of cannons and bullets. We use the gaps in battles to plant vegetables on the mountains and down the slopes, and after several battles, the green vegetables grow up, as large as the green vegetables in the motherland." Mine-sweeping hero Yao Xianru told the military dependents:
    "We are not afraid of the cold even at thirty degrees below zero, because the cotton clothes sent by the people of the motherland are so warm."
    The heroes also asked about the lives of the military dependents. Bai Yuzhen said, "The government's care and concern for us are meticulous. They think of us every time there are festivals, or wind and rain. The director of the Civil Affairs Bureau and the chief of the preferential treatment section personally go to the fields to check whether the crops of the military dependents are growing tall or short, whether the seedlings are fat or thin, and whether the land is dry or waterlogged. During the busy farming season, whether it is spring plowing and sowing, sending manure and watering, or harvesting and threshing, whenever we are too busy, people come to help us. In the spring, they organize a tilling team. In the autumn, just after the White Dew, the wheat of our military dependents has already been planted. The fields are all growing lush and green. As winter approaches, the government has sent winter clothing allowances and heating allowances to the elderly military dependents." She also reported her production achievements to the heroes, saying, "This year's harvest is one-third higher than in previous years, with more than a thousand catties of corn harvested; the sweet potatoes harvested have already been sold for more than one million yuan, and two fat pigs have been bought; five or six dan of millet have also been harvested. We don't have to worry about food or clothing. The children are studying in school, and the teachers and students respect and love them, saying that she is a child of the Volunteer Army, and they let her sit in the front row in class."
    Luo, the section chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau who came with them, introduced Bai Yuzhen's deeds in uniting military dependents and organizing production to the heroes. He said that Comrade Bai Yuzhen has helped the government with a lot of work. She has thought of many ways to organize military dependents to solve their own difficulties. For example, she took the lead in organizing a women's laundry group to wash clothes and mend socks for the comrades of the troops stationed in the village. The comrades of the troops are very grateful to them, and they have organized to help the masses in production, solving the problem of labor shortage in the village.
    These "family conversations" seemed endless, and the "family" became more and more lively. Comrade Bai Yuzhen asked the heroes to sit cross-legged on the kang, changed a pot of fresh tea, and sent apples, bananas, pears, peanuts, grapes, and other fruits to everyone. Her children, Xiao Lan and Hui Lan, also came, and everyone hugged them tightly. Xiao Lan suddenly seemed to remember something and ran to the table to take a letter from the drawer. This letter was originally written to the Volunteer Army uncles during the National Day, but had not yet been sent. She put down the big apple in her hand, picked up the letter and read, "...I will definitely listen to the teacher in school and study hard..." The heroes listened with smiles, excitedly picking her up and lifting her high. Anti-aircraft hero Liang Zhenlong said, "Good child, your father and I are fighting the American devils together. I will take the letter back with me and show it to your father, and he will definitely eliminate more American devils after seeing it!"
    It was already afternoon. The tangerine-red sun shone on the soft wheat fields, and a burst of laughter sent the heroes to the car. As they left, Comrade Liang Zhenlong asked, "Does Comrade Bai Yuzhen have a letter to take to Comrade Lin Guoquan?" She stood on the loess slope, her face flushed, and smiled, saying, "When I have completed my literacy course, I will write to him, telling him to do his work solidly at the front and to add merit upon merit!"

    “回到了自己的家里”
    ——记志愿军战斗英雄访问军属白玉珍
    陆光泽
    十月十九日，十位回国参加国庆节观礼的志愿军战斗英雄访问了北京西郊正黄旗村的志愿军军属白玉珍。
    正黄旗村紧依着西山，早晨的阳光把它照得金黄。英雄们还没有下车，村里男女老少就蜂涌上来，把汽车围得水泄不通。一位军属老太太握住了高射英雄梁振龙同志的手，把他从车上拉下来，抚摸着他胸前的勋章，说：“看到了你们，就像看到了我的儿子回来了！”英雄扶着老太太边走边说：“看到你老人家，就像看见了自己的父母。”
    在欢笑声里，一位穿着一身崭新的深蓝色衣服，态度和蔼，举止稳重的年青妇女出现在人群中。她来不及和每个英雄握手，用一双手捧住了好几位英雄的手，笑着说：“你们回到了自己的家里可真乐！小兰（她大女孩）天天在盼望着志愿军叔叔们回来，今天可把叔叔们盼回来了！”
    这就是英雄们特地来访问的白玉珍同志。她是一位年青的优秀的共产党员。自她丈夫林国全出国作战以后，在缺乏劳动力的困难情况下，她不仅把自己的家庭建设得很美丽幸福，而且在政府号召的各个运动里，都以身作则，带动群众，不辞劳苦地工作。全村的人民选她当了副村长、并推举她为北京市人民代表。今天看见了和她丈夫在一起战斗的这么多的英雄，怎能不欢喜呢！她一面笑嘻嘻地询问着前线的情形，一面把英雄们领到她的家里。
    这是两间瓦平房。院子里打扫得很干净，一切东西都安放得有条有理。屋檐下面放着一大堆白薯和一箩一箩的玉米，肥猪在猪棚里睡着。她指着那堆白薯说：“这是预备给肥猪吃的。”旁边的一位老乡插嘴说：“同志，我们的生活比过去好多了。国民党在时，人吃白薯叶都不容易；现在我们拿白薯喂猪了。这都是毛主席领导得好，是同志们打美帝国主义保卫我们，使我们能够顺利地进行生产的功劳。”白玉珍把英雄们引进她的屋子，屋子里整洁清新。床上垒着几床花被。她兴奋地一面倒茶、拿香烟，安置大家坐下；一面指着屋子说：“这房子、粮食和土地，都是毛主席给我们带来的。”她把林国全同志寄回来的喜报、家信和照片拿出来给同志们看。高射英雄梁振龙同志看到信上的番号，高兴地说：“林国全同志和我是在一个部队，这次回去我一定要去找他，把见你的情形告诉他。”接着，他又介绍道：“他们那个团是个英雄团，打了许多漂亮仗。林国全同志又立了功，你们真是英雄夫妇！”
    朝鲜前线能否吃到青菜？棉衣厚实不厚实？从祖国送去的东西需要多少时间才能运到？白玉珍和军属们非常详细地问着这些问题。英雄郭金声说：“在朝鲜前线，我们也有青菜吃。我们的青菜是在炮火枪弹下面生长的。我们利用战斗空隙，在山上山下种上菜，经过几次战斗的时间，青菜长大了，和祖国的青菜一样肥大。”扫雷英雄姚显儒告诉军属们：
    “我们在零下三十度也不怕冷，就是因为祖国人民送来的棉衣顶暖和。”
    英雄们也问起军属的生活，白玉珍说：“政府对我们的照顾和关心，是无微不至的。每逢过年过节、刮风下雨都想到我们。民政局局长和优抚科科长，亲自下地检查，看军属的庄稼长得是高是矮，苗子是胖是瘦，地是旱还是涝。农忙时节，无论春耕播种，送粪浇水，收割打场，只要自己忙不过来时，都有人来帮助我们。春天就组织代耕队。秋天白露刚过，我们军属的麦子早就种好了。那家地里都长得青腾腾的。冬天快到，现在政府又给军属的老人们发来了冬衣费和烤火费。”她又向英雄们报告自己生产的成绩说：“今年的收成比往年增加了三分之一，收了一千多斤玉米；收的红薯已经卖了一百多万元，买了两头肥猪；谷子也打了五六石。不愁吃、不愁穿。孩子在学校念书，老师和同学都敬爱她，说她是志愿军的孩子，上课让她坐在前排。”
    同来的民政局的罗科长，向英雄们介绍了白玉珍团结军属，组织生产的事迹。他说，白玉珍同志帮助政府做了很多工作。她想了许多办法，组织军属自己解决困难。比如，她带头组织了妇女洗衣组，给驻在本村的部队同志洗衣服、补鞋袜。部队同志很感谢她们，他们组织起来帮助群众生产，解决了村子里缺乏劳动力的困难。
    这些“家常话”好像是谈不完的，“一家人”越谈越热闹起来。白玉珍同志叫英雄们盘坐到炕上，换上一壶新茶，把苹果、香蕉、梨、花生、葡萄等送到每个人的面前。她的孩子小兰和慧兰也来了，大家一把抱住了她们。小兰忽然像想起了什么，跑到桌子跟前从抽屉里拿出一封信。这封信原是她在国庆节时给志愿军叔叔们写的，还没有寄走。她放下手里的大苹果，拿起信来就念：“……我一定在学校里听老师的话，好好学习。……”英雄们含笑听着，兴奋地把她抱着举了起来。高射英雄梁振龙同志说：“好孩子，你爸爸和我一起在打美国鬼子。信由我带回去，一定也给你爸爸看看，他看到后一定会消灭更多的美国鬼子！”
    已经是下午了。橘红色的太阳照在松软的麦田里，一阵欢笑声把英雄们送到汽车上。走的时候，梁振龙同志还问：“白玉珍同志有信捎给林国全同志吗？”她站在黄土坡上，脸红了，笑着说：“等我完成了速成识字，就给他写信，告诉他，在前方把工作做扎实，要功上加功！”
