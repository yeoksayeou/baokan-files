    Thanks to Soviet Experts for Their Help
    To the Editor: The boiler steam turbine of the No. 2 Power Plant of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau often generated only one-fourth of its full capacity during the period of Japanese and puppet rule. After liberation, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the turbine of this machine was overhauled, restoring the power generation capacity. In September of this year, the machine broke down again, with the vertical shaft bent by 20 silks (a unit of measurement). Later, adopting the advanced experience of the Soviet "heating and straightening shaft method," it was repaired after one heating.
    In addition, we have also learned advanced Soviet methods of managing the electricity industry and formulated various rules and regulations. In 1950, we created a new record of eight months of safe power generation, and we were honored to receive a letter of commendation from Chairman Mao. In February of this year, we promoted the Soviet experience of burning low-value coal, reducing power generation costs by 27% and saving a large amount of industrial coal for the country.
    At present, all the staff of our factory are working hard to learn advanced Soviet experience in economic accounting and technical norm verification, preparing to create more wealth for the motherland. Zhang Qingquan

    感谢苏联专家对我们的帮助
    编辑同志：天津电业局第二发电厂锅炉汽机，在日伪统治时期，发电量经常为全出力的四分之一。解放后，在苏联专家的指导下，检修了这部机器的汽轮机，恢复了发电量。今年九月，该机器又出了毛病，立轴弯了二十丝，后来采用苏联“加热直轴法”的先进经验，经过一次加热后，就修好了。
    另外，我们还学习了苏联管理电业的先进方法，制订出各种规程制度。一九五○年，创造了八个月安全发电的新纪录，光荣地受到毛主席来信表扬。今年二月，我们又推行了苏联烧低值煤的经验，降低发电成本百分之二十七，并为国家节约了大量工业用煤。
    目前我厂全体职工正努力学习苏联的经济核算、技术定额查定等先进经验，准备为祖国创造更多的财富。　张清泉
