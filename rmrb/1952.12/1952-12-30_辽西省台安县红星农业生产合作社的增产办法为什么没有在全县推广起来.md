Liaoxi Province, Tai'an County, Sixth District, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, in the patriotic production increase movement, brought into play the enthusiasm of collective labor, changed the old farming methods, and implemented new farming methods of timely sowing, wide sowing and dense planting, and thinning and seedling protection. As a result, the entire cooperative obtained a bumper harvest on 17 hectares and 4.9 mu of land, and created high yields of wheat and sorghum. The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative's experience in increasing production is of great significance to the production increase movement in Tai'an County. It has grasped the main key to increasing production in Tai'an County, pointed out the direction for leading the production increase movement in the future, and given the County Committee great enlightenment.

The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative's production increase methods were jointly researched and developed by Comrade Zhu Deqing of the County Committee Research Group, who was stationed in the cooperative for a long time, and the cooperative members during the spring plowing. They had been promoted through appraisal and publicity in the village where the cooperative was located and in the Sixth District. The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative's experience was also reported at several County Committee meetings, and some mutual aid groups had also imitated this method and achieved certain results. But why was this experience not vigorously promoted comprehensively as the center of a mass movement? The reason is that the County Committee did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of this production increase method and did not see that this was the key to increasing production in Tai'an County. This is partly due to our lack of sensitivity, and on the other hand, the most basic reason is the lack of serious research on a series of issues such as local farming methods and the possibility of increasing production. The failure to universally promote the Red Star Cooperative's experience is a major lesson in our production increase movement this year.

The incident of the Red Star Cooperative's failure to promote its bumper harvest experience and the bumper harvest movement in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, have given us great enlightenment. To lead the bumper harvest movement, we must thoroughly transform the general leadership style that does not delve into reality, go deep into the masses, conduct investigation and research, summarize the experience of the masses, and be good at applying the experience of the masses to the masses. At present, in order to make the Red Star Production Cooperative's experience more substantial and richer, we are combining it with the experience of Zhaoyuan County to summarize the county's bumper harvest experience, so as to conduct a mass technical reform movement with leadership and lay the foundation for cooperativization.

    辽西省台安县红星农业生产合作社的增产办法为什么没有在全县推广起来
    中共台安县委员会
    辽西省台安县六区红星农业生产合作社，在爱国丰产运动中发挥了集体劳动的积极性，改变了旧的耕作法，实行了适时播种、宽播密植、间苗保苗的新的耕作法，因而全社十七垧四亩九分地获得了丰产，并创造了小麦、高粱高额产量。红星农业生产合作社的丰产经验，对台安县的增产运动有很大意义，它抓住了台安县增产的主要关键，指出了今后领导丰产运动的方向，给县委以极大的启示。
    红星农业生产合作社的增产方法，是长期驻在该社的县委研究组朱德清同志和该社社员在春耕时共同研究出来的，并曾在该社所在的村和六区通过评比宣传推广，在几次县委召开的会议上，也曾报告了红星农业生产合作社的经验，部分互助组也曾仿行了这个办法，并获得一定成绩。但是为什么没有全面地以此经验为中心大力推广，成为群众性的运动呢？其原因是：县委对这一增产办法的意义认识不足，没有看出这是台安县增产的关键。这，一方面由于我们缺乏敏感，一方面，最基本的原因，还在于缺乏对本地耕作方法、增产可能性等一系列的问题的认真的研究。红星社的经验未普遍推广，是我们今年增产运动中的一项重大的教训。
    红星社丰产经验未推广的事件和黑龙江省肇源县的丰产运动，给了我们以很大启示，领导丰产运动必须彻底地转变不深入实际的一般化的领导作风，深入群众，进行调查研究，总结群众的经验，并善于把群众的经验运用到群众中去。目前我们为了把红星生产合作社的经验更加充实与丰富起来，正结合着肇源县的经验，总结全县的丰产经验，以便有领导地开展一个群众性的技术改革运动，打下合作化的基础。
