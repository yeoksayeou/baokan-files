　　The Great Warrior Qiu Shaoyun

　　In the counterattack on Hill 391 west of Kimhwa, a great warrior emerged who sacrificed himself for victory and to preserve the whole: Qiu Shaoyun.

　　On October 11, Qiu Shaoyun and his comrades were ordered to lie in ambush very close to the enemy's position, and to launch an attack at dusk the next day in order to suddenly annihilate the enemy.

　　Their ambush location was on the hillside of Hill 391, which was occupied by the enemy, and there was no terrain or trees to provide cover. Yesterday, a pheasant flew up from here, which caused the enemy to fire guns and cannons for a long time! Now they were required to conceal themselves in such a place for more than twenty hours, without being discovered by the enemy, which was extremely difficult. Before the soldiers set off, the unit leader specifically told them: "This time you are going to lie in ambush, you must rely on clever disguise, you must rely on composure, and more importantly, you must abide by the discipline of lying in ambush. Even if someone is hit by enemy bullets, they must not reveal their target." The soldiers replied in unison: "Please rest assured, commander, for the sake of the motherland, for the sake of victory, for the sake of the Chinese and Korean people, we will lie in ambush well under any circumstances and complete the combat mission."

　　After dark, the soldiers secretly felt their way to the ambush site. They dispersed in groups of three and four, hiding in the reeds. Everyone was covered with weeds from head to toe, disguised like the grass on the hillside. When the cool breeze blew, the grass on their bodies swayed along with the grass on the ground, showing no trace at all. They could also clearly see the enemy's machine gun barrels sticking out from the bunker gun holes and the faces peering out of the observation holes. Sometimes, the enemy's voices could be heard clearly.

　　Time passed second by second. At eleven o'clock the next day, a stray enemy incendiary bomb suddenly landed next to Qiu Shaoyun and set the weeds on his body on fire. At this time, it was entirely possible for him to stand up and extinguish the flames on his body. However, Qiu Shaoyun deeply understood that if he did so, he would be discovered by the enemy on the hilltop, and the dozens of comrades lying in ambush here would be in danger of being annihilated, and the original combat plan would not be completed. The commanders on our army's position saw smoke rising from the ambush site and immediately ordered the artillery to bombard the enemy to disrupt their attention. At this time, Qiu Shaoyun still did not get up to extinguish the flames on his body. The flames had already spread to his head. At this critical moment of life and death, Qiu Shaoyun tightly gripped the submachine gun loaded with bullets, looked at the enemy not far in front of him, and very much wanted to rush up and fight the enemy, but he did not do so. The fire continued to burn, burning Qiu Shaoyun's skin. Qiu Shaoyun endured unimaginable physical pain, gritted his teeth, and plunged his hands deeply into the soil. Then, he suddenly raised his head and said in a weak voice to his closest comrade, Li Shihu: "Victory is ours, but I cannot complete the demolition mission. I entrust this mission to you!" After saying that, he painfully pressed his burning body more tightly to the ground, and did not move until he sacrificed himself.

　　The fire burned for more than twenty minutes, until after Qiu Shaoyun sacrificed himself, the fire was extinguished.

　　Our hero—Qiu Shaoyun—endured physical pain with superhuman willpower for the sake of the motherland, for the sake of the whole, and for the sake of victory, even to the point of sacrificing his precious life.

　　The dozens of soldiers lying in ambush in this patch of grass all witnessed the whole process. The fire burning on Qiu Shaoyun's body was like burning in their hearts. They were moved to tears by Qiu Shaoyun's great spirit. But like Qiu Shaoyun, in order not to expose their target, they could not rescue their comrades either. They endured the pain in their hearts and waited for the moment of battle to arrive.

　　Li Shihu, who was three meters away from Qiu Shaoyun, also had blisters from the fire on his face, but because he had soaked his entire cotton uniform when crossing the river, his body was not burned by the fire. When the fire was burning Qiu Shaoyun, he watched him all the time, saw Qiu Shaoyun's hair burning, his cotton uniform burning, he heard the sound of Qiu Shaoyun's skin being burned by the fire, he smelled the smell of Qiu Shaoyun's body being burned to a crisp, his eyes were flashing sparks, he was so anxious that he bit his lip, and several times instinctively wanted to get up and put out the fire on his comrade's body, but he, like Qiu Shaoyun, like all the comrades lying in ambush there—thought of the whole, thought of the victory of the entire battle. So, he endured the inner pain and anxiously awaited the signal for revenge.

　　Qiu Shaoyun is a great warrior. And Qiu Shaoyun's comrades are worthy of being the sons of our motherland who are worthy of pride and self-esteem. They deeply understood and, in the most dangerous and difficult circumstances, executed the military creed—gloriously sacrifice the individual to win the victory of the entire battle.

　　The moment the warriors longed for finally arrived. The enemy's bunker was shattered to pieces by our army's torrential artillery fire. The soldiers of the assault team launched an attack from the grass. Li Shihu ran quickly to the side of martyr Qiu Shaoyun, covered his remains with his coat, and then picked up the submachine gun and demolition tube left by the martyr, shouting "Avenge Martyr Qiu Shaoyun!" He shot through two lines of enemy barbed wire like an arrow, and stuffed the demolition tube into the gun hole of an enemy bunker. In a loud noise, the enemy and its bunker were annihilated together. Then, the sound of "Avenge Martyr Qiu Shaoyun" echoed throughout the mountains, the flashing light of exploding enemy bunkers filled the mountains, and the sound of gunfire killing the enemy filled the mountains. In less than fifteen minutes, the warriors occupied the enemy's position and achieved a victory in annihilating an enemy strengthened company.

### 伟大的战士邱少云

　　伟大的战士邱少云
    在金化以西三九一高地的反击战中，出现了一位为着胜利、保全整体而牺牲自己的伟大战士邱少云。
    十月十一日，邱少云和他的战友奉命到离敌人阵地很近的地方去潜伏，等到第二天傍晚发起战斗，以便突然地去消灭敌人。
    他们潜伏的地方是在敌人盘踞着的三九一高地的山坡上，又没有荫蔽身体的地形和树木。昨天，从这里飞起一只野鸡，还惹得敌人打了半天枪炮呢！现在要他们在这样一个地方荫蔽二十多个钟头，不让敌人发现，这是极不容易的事情。在战士们出发以前，部队首长特地对他们讲：“你们这次去潜伏，要靠巧妙的伪装，要靠沉着，更重要的是要遵守潜伏纪律。那怕有人被敌人子弹打中了，也不能暴露目标。”战士们同声回答说：“请首长放心，为了祖国，为了胜利，为了中朝人民，在任何情况下也要潜伏好，完成战斗任务。”
    天黑以后，战士们秘密地摸到了潜伏地。他们三个一组，四个一组的分散开来，潜藏在茅草中。每个人从头到脚都插上了野草，伪装得像山坡上的草一样，凉风吹过，人身上的草和地上的草一同摆动，显不出一点儿痕迹。他们还可以清楚地看到从地堡枪眼里伸出来的敌人机枪筒和了望孔缩头缩脑向外张望的面孔，有时，敌人讲话的声音也能清楚地听到。
    时间一分一秒地过去。到第二天十一点钟的时候，敌人盲目发射的一颗燃烧弹突然落在邱少云身边，并且烧着了他身上的野草。这时，他要站起来是完全可以扑灭身上的火苗的。但是，邱少云深切的懂得，要是这样做，就会被山顶上的敌人发觉，潜伏在这里的几十位战友就有被消灭的危险，原定的战斗计划也就不能完成。我军阵地上的指挥员看到潜伏地冒起了烟火，连忙命令炮兵向敌人轰击，扰乱敌人的注意力。这时候，邱少云还是没有爬起来扑灭自己身上的火焰。火焰已经延烧到了他的头上。在这个生死关头，邱少云紧握着压满子弹的冲锋枪，看看前面不远的敌人，很想冲上去和敌人拚了，但是他没有这样做。烈火继续在燃烧着，烧烂了邱少云的皮肤。邱少云忍受着难以想像的肉体痛苦，咬着牙，把两手深深地插入泥土。然后猛地抬起头来，用微弱的声音向离他最近的战友李士虎说：“胜利是我们的，但是我不能完成爆破任务了，这个任务交给你去完成吧！”说完，他又痛苦地把被烈火烧着的身体更紧地贴到地上，一直到牺牲时，也没动一下。
    烈火烧了二十多分钟，直到邱少云牺牲后，烈火才熄灭了。
    我们的英雄——邱少云就是这样地以超人的意志力，为祖国、为整体、为胜利而忍受了肉体的苦痛，以至到最后献出自己的宝贵生命。
    潜伏在这一片草丛里的几十位战士，都亲眼看到了这件事情的经过。烈火烧在邱少云身上，就像烧在他们的心上。他们被邱少云的伟大精神感动得流出了热泪。但是他们也和邱少云一样，为了不暴露目标，也不能够去救援自己的战友。他们忍受着心灵上的痛苦，等待着战斗时刻的到来。
    和邱少云相距三公尺远的李士虎脸上也被烈火烧起了血泡，只是他在来时因过河把全身棉衣湿透了，身上才没有被烈火烧着。当烈火燃烧着邱少云的时候，他一直眼睁睁地看着他，看到了邱少云的头发烧着了，棉衣烧着了，他听到邱少云的皮肤被烈火烧得嗤嗤地发响，他闻到了邱少云的身体被烧成枯焦的气味，他眼睛里冒着火星，急得咬破了嘴唇，几次本能地想爬起来去扑灭战友身上的火，但是他和邱少云一样，和潜伏在那里所有的战友们一样——想到了整体，想到整个战斗的胜利。于是，他忍受着内心的痛苦，焦急地期待着复仇的信号。
    邱少云是伟大的战士。而邱少云的战友，也不愧为我们祖国值得骄傲和自豪的子弟。他们深深地领会了、并且在最最艰危的情况下执行了军事上的信条——光荣地牺牲个体、争取整个战斗的胜利。
    勇士们盼望的时刻终于来到了。敌人的地堡被我军暴雨般的炮弹炸得粉碎。突击队的战士们从草从里发起了攻击。李士虎飞快地跑到烈士邱少云身旁，用大衣盖住他的遗体，然后抱起烈士遗留下来的冲锋枪和爆破筒，高喊着“为邱少云烈士复仇啊！”他箭一般地冲过两道敌人的铁丝网，把爆破筒塞到敌人一个地堡枪眼里，在一声巨响中，敌人和它的地堡一同消灭了。接着，满山响着“为邱少云烈士报仇”的声音，满山是爆炸敌人地堡的闪闪火光，满山是杀敌的枪声。不到十五分钟，勇士们占领了敌军阵地，取得了歼灭李伪军一个加强连的胜利。
