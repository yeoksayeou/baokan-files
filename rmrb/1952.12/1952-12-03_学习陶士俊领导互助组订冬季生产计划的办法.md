    Learning from Tao Shijun's Methods for Leading Mutual Aid Teams in Formulating Winter Production Plans
    Editor: Production Assistant Tao Shijun of Anyi County, Shanxi Province, began working in Ducaicun Village on October 28th. He discovered that the masses in the village had a serious "winter idleness" mentality, and many mutual aid teams were trending towards stagnation and disintegration. After discovering these phenomena, Tao Shijun went to the Jin Liangming mutual aid team to persuade and mobilize everyone. He said that now is the eve of the country's large-scale economic construction. A good winter production this year will prepare us for large-scale production next year. We must turn "winter idleness" into winter busyness. Everyone felt that what he said was right, so they asked him to help formulate a production plan. In the process of formulating the plan, they also found that the team members had conservative ideas and emphasized sideline occupations while downplaying agriculture. Tao Shijun first exchanged views with some of the team members, and then, in light of the specific situation that the team had many sloping fields, he put forward the slogan "One year of hard work, ten thousand years of more grain." He explained that only by turning the sloping fields into terraced fields can total income be greatly increased. He also helped the team summarize the mutual assistance experience of the whole year, and specifically calculated the accounts, proving two facts: (1) This year, due to organization, production increased more than last year and more than individual households. (2) This year's production did not increase much because it was not combined with basic construction work such as well digging and land improvement. Then, he introduced some vivid facts about how digging wells, installing water wheels, and improving saline-alkali land can increase production. After repeated explanations and discussions, the team members' conservative ideas and their emphasis on sideline occupations while downplaying agriculture were finally overcome, and all team members were helped to formulate a winter production plan focusing on agricultural basic construction such as terracing, afforestation, and manure accumulation. Everyone happily said, "We have so much work to do. We will be busy this winter and harvest more grain next year." The women said, "I was planning to stay at my mother's house this winter, but now I'm not going. I want to do a good job in winter production." This plan has been introduced at the village mutual aid team leaders' meeting, and each team has referred to this plan to formulate its own winter production plan. Two mutual aid teams automatically merged into one team. They said, "More people are needed to do a good job in basic construction." The common reflection of the team members is that "mutual aid teams can be consolidated with a plan," and the village cadres said, "Winter production in our village is guaranteed not to be left to its own devices."
    We believe that Comrade Tao Shijun's work style of going deep among the masses and breaking the masses' conservative ideas, and his experience in leading the masses to formulate winter production plans are very good. We are introducing it here for the reference of comrades in various places who lead rural work.　The Communist Party of China Anyi County Committee

    学习陶士俊领导互助组订冬季生产计划的办法
    编辑同志：山西安邑县生产助理员陶士俊同志十月二十八日到杜蔡村工作，发现该村群众有严重的
    “冬闲”思想，许多互助组有趋向消沉解体的现象。陶士俊发现这些现象后，便深入到靳亮明互助组去，对大家进行说服动员。他说，现在是国家进行大规模经济建设的前夜，今年冬季生产得好，就给明年大生产作好了准备，我们要把“冬闲”变为冬忙。大家觉得他说的很对，就请他帮助订生产计划。在订计划的过程中，又发现组员们有保守思想和重副业轻农业的思想。陶士俊先和部分组员交换意见，然后针对该组有不少坡地的具体情况，提出了“一年费辛苦、万年多打粮”的口号。说明只有把坡地修成梯田，才能大量增加总收入。他又帮助该组总结了全年的互助经验，具体算了一下账，证明了两个事实：（一）今年由于组织起来，比去年、比单干户都增产了。（二）今年的生产因为没有和打井、修地等基本建设工作结合起来，因此产量还增的不太多。接着，他向大家介绍了一些打井安水车、改良碱地可以增产的生动事实。经过这样一次再次地解释讨论，终于克服了组员们的保守思想和重副业轻农业的思想，帮助全体组员订出了以进行修梯田、植树造林、积肥等农业基本建设为主的冬季生产计划。大家都高兴地说：“咱有这样多的活要干，今年冬天忙，明年多打粮。”妇女们说：“冬天还计划住娘家哩，现在不去了。要好好搞冬季生产。”这个计划在全村互助组长会上介绍过了，各组都参考这个计划，订出了冬季生产计划。有两个互助组自动合并为一个组，他们说：“人多才能搞好基本建设”。各组组员的共同反映是“互助组有了计划就能巩固了”，村干部们说：“咱村的冬季生产保证不会自流了”。
    我们认为陶士俊同志这种深入群众的工作作风和打破群众保守思想，领导群众制订冬季生产计划的经验是很好的，特把它介绍出来，供各地领导农村工作的同志参考。　中共山西安邑县委员会
