    The Shenyang Smelter's Meetings Are Too Many and Too Chaotic
    Editor: I am a worker in the lead blast furnace workshop of the smelting department of the Shenyang Smelter. I am a member of the New Democratic Youth League, the workshop's trade union chairman, and a Party propagandist. Although I am happy to have so many positions to serve the people, based on my practical experience, I feel that the leadership of our factory must quickly resolve the problem of excessive meetings and excessively long after-work activities for employees. This is because it has seriously affected my ability to study and work better.
    Our factory has many departments, operates day and night, and the working conditions are relatively poor. Most of the workers are on three shifts. Therefore, how to reasonably allocate the after-work activities time of employees is a very complex and important task. However, the unreasonable phenomena of too many, chaotic, and lengthy meetings in our factory have not been resolved. Although the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a decision on reasonably arranging the after-work activities time of employees at the end of last year, and the factory's Party committee also established a "Meeting, Learning, and After-Work Activities Time System" in June of this year, this system was abandoned after only a few days of implementation. The situation of too many, chaotic, and lengthy meetings remains. Take me for example, the meetings and learning I have to attend in my spare time are as follows: I have to attend a joint meeting of the workshop's Party, government, trade union, and Youth League, as well as a daily production inspection meeting every day (except Sunday); I have to participate in technical learning every Monday and Wednesday; I have to participate in Party rectification learning every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday; I have to hold a workshop trade union committee, trade union group meeting, a Party propagandist meeting, and listen to a Youth League lesson every week; I have to hold a joint meeting of workshop trade union chairmen, a production evaluation meeting of the smelting department, and a production summary meeting of the lead blast furnace workshop every ten days. There are a total of eighty-five calculable meetings in a month, each lasting one and a half hours (actually more than one and a half hours), totaling more than one hundred and twenty hours. In addition to some unquantifiable temporary meetings, I have to participate in collective activities for more than thirty-two hours a week in my spare time. In this way, in addition to not being able to study the cultural courses I urgently need to study, I also lack basic sleep and rest time. My eyes are often bloodshot, and my body is dizzy. I can't exert my strength when working, especially when on night shift. We work night shifts one week out of every three weeks. Those on night shift also have to attend meetings with those on day shift. In this situation, I can only sleep for three or four hours a day. Take the day before yesterday (November 12) as an example. I started my night shift at eight o'clock in the evening and finished at four o'clock the next morning. After eating and showering, it was already past five o'clock. In theory, I should go home to rest immediately; but, no, because there is a joint meeting of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League from six to eight o'clock. Immediately after, there is a Youth League lesson from eight to ten o'clock, and a propagandist meeting from ten to twelve o'clock. My home is far from the factory. When I got home that day, it was already one o'clock in the afternoon. My back had just touched the kang mat, and I hadn't even had time to recover, and I had to get up again, because there is a current affairs report meeting at the factory at 5:30, and you can't oversleep past four o'clock. This is my life for a day. Such a situation is not rare for me, and it is not just me in our factory. Sometimes I think to myself: Can this go on? I know it can't. Because I have personally seen Guan Shilin, who works with me (he is the secretary of the Youth League branch in our workshop and is very active), because he has too many meetings in his spare time and cannot get the rest he deserves, one day he was discharging lead. The fiery red lead water passed from the siphon of the lead furnace through the settling pot and into the mold. This is a tense stage in production. He was holding the handle of the settling pot, but he dozed off. He lost his hand, and the boiling lead water spilled onto the ground, almost causing a major disaster. I think if he wasn't so fatigued, he wouldn't joke with his own life. I wanted to express my opinion, but I was afraid that people would laugh at us for being "afraid of hard work," "not active enough," and "still a member of the Youth League!" So I kept the words in my mouth for a long time. Now I realize that this concern is unnecessary. Because the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party already has instructions to reasonably arrange the after-work activities time of employees in various factories. It is wrong that our factory has not followed this instruction. It is because the leading cadres of our factory are not very concerned about the health and learning of the workers and do not pay enough attention to the instructions of the higher authorities. Therefore, I am willing to raise it to attract their attention.

### 沈阳冶炼厂的会议又多又乱

    沈阳冶炼厂的会议又多又乱
    编辑同志：我是沈阳冶炼厂熔炼部铅鼓风炉车间的工人，是新民主主义青年团员，是车间的工会主席和党的宣传员。我虽然高兴能有这许多为人民服务的工作岗位；但是从我的实际体验中，觉得我们厂的领导方面必须迅速解决职工开会过多、业余活动时间过长的问题。因为它已经严重地影响着我不能更好地学习和工作了。
    我们厂是个摊子多、日夜不停地生产、劳动条件又较坏的工厂。工人大部分是三班倒制。因此，怎样合理分配职工的业余活动时间，是一件十分复杂而又重要的工作。但是我们厂会议又多又乱、时间拖的挺长的不合理现象一直得不到解决。虽然中共沈阳市委员会在去年年底便发出了关于合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定，我们厂的党委在今年六月间也曾订立一个“会议、学习业余活动时间制度”。但这个制度实行不到几天就给打烂了。会议多、乱、时间长的情形依然存在。拿我来说吧，在业余时间要参加的会议和学习就这么多：每天（星期日例外）要开一次车间党、政、工、团碰头会和一次当天生产检查会；每星期一、三要参加技术学习；每星期二、四、日要参加整党学习；每星期要开一次车间工会委员会、工会小组会、党的宣传员会和听一次团课；每十天要开一次车间工会主席联席会、熔炼部的生产评定会、铅鼓风炉车间的生产小结会。一个月中间能够算出来的会共有八十五次，每次以一小时半计算（实际上决不止一小时半），共一百二十几个小时。再加上一些无法计算的临时性的会议，每星期我在业余时间要参加的集体活动总在三十二个小时以上。这样我除了不能学习我迫切需要学习的文化课以外，还缺乏起码的睡眠和休息时间，经常眼睛熬红了，身子也矇头转向，干活时使不出劲来。特别是轮值干夜班时。我们三个星期中有一个星期是干夜班活。轮值夜班的也要和白班的一起开会。碰到这种情形，我一天只能睡三、四个钟头的觉。就拿前天（十一月十二日）来打比方，这一天我是夜里八点钟上的班，到第二天早晨四点钟下班。吃过饭洗完澡已经是五点多，按理应该马上回家歇歇去；但，不行，因为六点到八点要开党、政、工、团的碰头会。紧接着八点到十点要上团课，十点到十二点是宣传员会议。我的家离厂较远，这一天我回到家里时已经是下午一时。背脊刚刚沾到炕席上，还没有歇过乏来又得起身，因为五时三十分厂里有个时事报告会，你再贪睡也不能睡过四点钟。这就是我一天的生活。像这样的情形对于我并不是稀罕事，在我们厂也不止我一人。有时我自己想：这样下去行吗？我懂得是不行的。因为我亲眼见到和我一起干活的关士林（他是我们车间的青年团支部书记，很积极），因为业余时间开会过多，得不到应有的休息，有一天正在出铅，火红的铅水从铅炉的虹吸管经过沉淀锅注到铸型里去，这是生产中紧张的阶段。他手里扶住沉淀锅柄可是却打起盹来，一失手，滚腾的铅水就泻到地上去，差点儿闯下大祸。我想不是疲劳过度，他是不会拿自家的生命来开玩笑的。我想把意见提出来，又怕人家笑话我们“怕劳累”、“不积极”、“还是个青年团员哩！”所以话在嘴里边搁了很久。现在我认识到这种顾虑是多余的。因为中共沈阳市委早就有指示，要各厂合理支配职工的业余活动时间。我厂没有按照这一指示办事是错误的，是由于我们厂的领导干部对工人的健康和学习不是十分关心，对上级的指示重视不够，所以我愿意提出来引起他们的重视。    李芳元
