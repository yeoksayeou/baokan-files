Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th: A U.S. invading Korean Air Force B-26 bomber intruded into the airspace over Dadonggou, Andong County, Liaodong Province, at 23:37 on December 8th. At 23:40, it intruded into Andong City via Langtou District of Andong City, and dropped two heavy bombs each on Minzhu Street and Fumin Street in the Zhenxing District of the town. Forty-seven of our male and female residents were injured (seven seriously injured and forty slightly injured); 243 houses were destroyed. This is another crime committed by the U.S. invading Korean Air Force of slaughtering our people, following the bombing of Jiuliancheng District of Andong City on November 28th.

Recently, the armed provocations of the U.S. aggressors have become even more frantic. In the ten days from November 29th to December 8th, U.S. planes intruded into the airspace of seven cities and counties in Liaodong and Jilin provinces in 31 batches of 155 sorties to carry out harassment. Our people express serious protest against this increasingly rampant provocative action by the U.S. aggressors and are determined to shatter the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war with practical actions.

    美机侵我安东炸伤居民四十七人
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】美国侵朝空军B—26型轰炸机一架，于十二月八日二十三时三十七分侵入我辽东省安东县大东沟上空，四十分经安东市浪头区侵扰安东市，向该市镇兴区民主街、福民街先后投下重磅炸弹各两枚。炸伤我男女居民四十七人（重伤七人，轻伤四十人）；炸毁房屋二百四十三间。这是美国侵朝空军继十一月二十八日轰炸我安东市九连城区之后又一次屠杀我国人民的罪行。
    最近美国侵略者的武装挑衅行动更加疯狂。在十一月二十九日到十二月八日的十天内，美机共三十一批一百五十五架次侵入我辽东、吉林两省的七个市、县上空进行骚扰。我国人民对美国侵略者这种变本加厉的挑衅行动，表示严重抗议，决以实际行动来粉碎美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋。
