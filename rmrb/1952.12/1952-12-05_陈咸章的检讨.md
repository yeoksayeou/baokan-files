    Chen Xianzhang's Self-Criticism

    Editor: Reader Zhang Songbo's criticism of my upholding feudal marriage and violating human rights is correct, and I sincerely accept it. Although this matter occurred in March 1950, shortly after liberation, it still reveals my strong feudal thinking and old judicial style. At that time, my "handling" of this matter had received "support" from some backward masses, and I was even complacent about it. Now, upon examination, I realize that it was a very serious mistake. My upholding feudal marriage in that way was tantamount to putting the shattered feudal shackles back on women's heads, preventing women's struggle for freedom of marriage, and affecting the subsequent implementation of the Marriage Law in our county. The error of infringing on human rights is even more serious. I feel very heartbroken. Why did I make such a serious mistake? The main reason is that I am an old judicial worker, and after liberation, I still had a set of old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles in my work. In addition to expressing my gratitude to reader Zhang Songbo's opinions, I hereby publicly apologize to Tan Duanxiu and her daughter, and request that the leadership give me the punishment I deserve. Currently, Leiling County is carrying out a judicial reform movement. I will definitely study hard and resolutely eliminate all my old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles.　Chen Xianzhang

    陈咸章的检讨
    编辑同志：读者张嵩伯对我维护封建婚姻，侵犯人权的批评是正确的，我诚恳地接受。这事虽然是发生在解放不久的一九五○年三月间，但总归表现了我的浓厚的封建思想和旧司法作风。当时，我对此事的“处理”办法曾经得到部分落后群众的“支持”，我因而还自鸣“得意”。现在检查起来，我才认识到那是一个非常严重的错误。我那样地维护封建婚姻，就等于硬要把已被打垮的封建枷锁从新放到妇女头上去，阻止了妇女要求婚姻自由的斗争，影响了后来本县对婚姻法的贯彻。侵犯人权的错误，更是严重。我感到很痛心。为什么我会产生那样严重的错误呢？主要因为我是一个旧司法人员，解放后我在工作中仍然有一套旧法观点和旧司法作风。我除了对读者张嵩伯的意见表示感谢外，特此公开向谭端秀母女道歉，并要求领导上给我以应得的处分。目前酃县正在进行司法改革运动，我一定努力学习，坚决肃清我的一切旧法观点，旧司法作风。　陈咸章
