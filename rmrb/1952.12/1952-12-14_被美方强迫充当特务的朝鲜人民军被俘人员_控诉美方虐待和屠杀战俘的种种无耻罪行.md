(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 13th) Four North Korean People's Army POWs, Sun Tae-jin, Hwang Ik-seong, Kim Kwang-il, and Cha Kwang-bin, who were coerced by the U.S. to act as spies and infiltrate North Korea, surrendered voluntarily to the North Korean internal affairs organs after entering North Korea. They accused the U.S. of heinous crimes of maltreating and massacring POWs, conducting forced "screening," and coercing POWs to act as spies. The accusations by Sun Tae-jin and others powerfully expose the bloody deceit of the U.S. imperialists' so-called "voluntary repatriation" that violates the Geneva Convention.
	Sun Tae-jin and the other three were imprisoned in the 84th, 61st, 64th, and 52nd POW camps on Geoje Island, respectively. They all personally suffered various abuses and forced "screening" by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee's bandit troops. Sun Tae-jin accused: "My original home is in Dongoe-dong, Goseong-eup, Goseong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do. In 1950, I was studying at Seoul Industrial University and welcomed 'June 28' (the day the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul). On July 15th of the same year, I joined the Volunteer Army and became a glorious soldier of the Korean People's Army. During the temporary retreat of the Korean People's Army, I was captured by the U.S. military after being separated from my unit. I was initially held in the Gaesong Juvenile Prison and the Incheon 3rd POW Camp, and in November of the same year, I was transferred to the 3rd POW Camp in Geoje-ri, Busan. Due to being forced to do excessively heavy labor, I contracted lung disease. Later, I was transferred to the 84th POW Camp on Geoje Island. Life in the POW camp was simply hell. It was surrounded by electrified barbed wire, and we had no freedom of movement whatsoever. When feeling unwell, we couldn't lie down and rest properly; entertainment was out of the question, even singing and playing chess were forbidden. The POW camp authorities forcibly implemented many 'rules,' and any slight violation would result in a severe beating, often to the point of unconsciousness. The U.S. military and Syngman Rhee's puppet army also frequently robbed us of our clothing to exchange for money for drinking and eating, forcing us to endure the cold weather in thin clothes and barefoot. The food was already very poor, as in other POW camps, but the U.S. military and Syngman Rhee's puppet army also exploited it, so only a small amount of mixed grains reached the POWs' mouths. On those days without forced labor, the U.S. military intelligence agency 'CIC' would send people to conduct forced 'civilian education' on us. This so-called education was to slander and defame the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, especially the People's Republic of China, and it was filled with propaganda and incitement for a new war. Many POWs were unwilling to listen to the enemy's reactionary propaganda and passively boycotted the classes. Some were discovered by the enemy and suffered severe beatings, and as a result, most became disabled." Sun Tae-jin explained that these inhumane abuses and persecutions by the U.S. aroused the angry resistance of our captured personnel. He described in detail the heroic resistance struggle carried out by our captured personnel in the 84th POW Camp in September 1951, as well as the barbaric and bloody suppression by the U.S. He said: "On September 15, 1951, representatives of our captured personnel in the 84th POW Camp presented eight reasonable demands to the U.S. POW camp commander, including treatment in accordance with the Geneva Convention, cessation of reactionary education, granting of due freedom, and issuance of winter clothing. However, on the 17th and 19th, they were met with a frenzied massacre by the U.S. military and Syngman Rhee's puppet army. The enemy not only opened fire and bombed our captured personnel but also used tear gas and stabbed POWs who were affected by the gas with bayonets, killing and injuring a large number of POWs. My left arm was also stabbed. The U.S. military police also confined more than 2,500 of our wounded captured personnel in a stone ground surrounded by three layers of barbed wire, punishing us with hunger and cold for three days."
	The enemy's maltreatment and persecution in the POW camp could not frustrate the strong and unyielding will of our captured personnel. Therefore, they sent the wounded, the sick, and the dying to so-called "hospitals" to continue their torture. Sun Tae-jin was sent to the 64th Field Hospital after becoming ill after being frozen for two days and nights. He accused the enemy of carrying out a vicious conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs in the "hospital." He said: "From April of this year, the enemy began conducting so-called 'screening based on free will' in the hospital. All Korean People's Army POWs whose homes were in North Korea were willing to return to the North, and even those whose homes were in South Korea demanded to return to the North. However, the enemy suppressed our will to return to the North with cruel torture."
	Sun Tae-jin finally accused of his experience of being forced to act as a spy: "On June 14th of this year, the enemy sent me to Busan under the vague pretext of training radio technicians, and later sent me to Seoul for radio technology training. As soon as the training ended, the enemy ordered me to carry out espionage activities in the northern half. At first, I was unwilling, and a U.S. Army captain in the U.S. intelligence system threatened me with a pistol. Under the enemy's threat, I reluctantly accepted the mission and was secretly landed on the coast of North Korea by boat. Due to the pangs of conscience, I surrendered to the domestic internal affairs organs after arriving in the northern half."

    被美方强迫充当特务的朝鲜人民军被俘人员
    控诉美方虐待和屠杀战俘的种种无耻罪行
    【新华社平壤十三日电】被美方胁迫充当特务潜入朝鲜北部的朝鲜人民军被俘人员孙泰镇、黄益成、金光一、车光彬等四人，在进入朝鲜北部以后，自动向朝鲜内务机关自首，并控诉了美方虐待和屠杀战俘、进行强迫“甄别”和胁迫战俘充当特务的种种无耻罪行。孙泰镇等的控诉，有力地揭露了美帝国主义者破坏日内瓦公约的所谓“自愿遣返”的血腥骗局。
    孙泰镇等四人曾被分别囚禁在巨济岛第八十四、六十一、六十四与五十二号战俘营。他们都亲身遭受过美李匪军的种种虐待和强迫“甄别”。孙泰镇控诉说：“我原籍在庆尚南道固城郡固城邑东外洞。一九五零年，我在汉城工业大学念书，迎接了‘六·二八’（朝鲜人民军解放汉城的日子）。同年七月十五日，参加义勇军，成为一个光荣的朝鲜人民军战士。在朝鲜人民军暂时撤退的时期，我因掉队而被美军俘掳，起先被关在开城少年监狱和仁川第三战俘营，同年十一月又被转押到釜山巨济里第三战俘营。由于被迫负担过重的劳役，我得了肺病。后来，又被转押到巨济岛第八十四号战俘营。战俘营里的生活简直就是地狱里的生活，四周是通电的铁丝网，我们的行动毫无自由可言。不舒服的时候不能躺下好好休息；娱乐根本谈不上，连唱歌、下棋也不行。战俘营当局强行制定了许多‘规则’，稍一违反就得挨一顿毒打，往往被打得人事不知。美军和李承晚伪军并经常抢夺我们的衣物，拿去换钱吃喝，让我们在寒冷的天气里穿着单衣赤着脚挨冻。伙食也和其他战俘营一样本来就很坏，美军和李伪军还从中剥削，因之落到战俘口中的只有少量的杂粮。在那些没有强迫劳役的日子里，美军特务机关‘CIC’就派人来，对我们施行强迫‘民间教育’，这些所谓教育是中伤诽谤苏联和各人民民主国家特别是中华人民共和国的，是以宣传、挑拨新战争为内容的。许多战俘都不愿意听敌人的这些反动宣传，消极怠课，有的被敌人发现，遭到了毒打，结果大部分都成为残废。”孙泰镇说明，美方这些绝灭人性的虐待和迫害，激起我方被俘人员的愤怒反抗。他详细地叙述了第八十四号战俘营中的我方被俘人员在一九五一年九月间所进行的英勇反抗斗争以及美方野蛮的血腥镇压。他说：一九五一年九月十五日，第八十四号战俘营中的我方被俘人员派遣代表向美方战俘营长官提出了按照日内瓦公约待遇、停止反动教育、给予应有的自由及发给冬服等八项合理要求，结果却在十七日和十九日遭到了美军和李伪军的疯狂屠杀。敌人不但向我方被俘人员开枪、轰炮，而且施用了催泪性毒气，用刺刀恣意刺杀中了毒气的战俘，杀伤了大批战俘，我的左臂也被刺伤。美国宪兵并把负伤的我方被俘人员二千五百多人禁闭在围着三重铁丝网的石头地上，罚我们挨饿挨冻三天。
    敌人在战俘营中的虐待和迫害，并不能挫折我方被俘人员的坚强不屈的意志。于是他们就把受伤的得病的奄奄一息的人们送进所谓“病院”去继续加以折磨。孙泰镇就是在被冻了两昼夜之后得了病被送进第六十四野战病院的。他控诉敌人在“病院”中进行强迫扣留战俘的凶恶阴谋。他说：从今年四月起，敌人开始在病院中进行所谓“根据自由意志的甄别”，所有家在朝鲜北部的朝鲜人民军战俘都愿意回到北部去，甚至家在南朝鲜的也要求返回北部。但是，敌人却以残酷的拷问来压制我们返回北部的意志。
    孙泰镇最后控诉他被迫充当特务的经过说：“今年六月十四日，敌人以集训无线电技术人员的含糊名义把我送到釜山，后又送我到汉城受无线电技术的训练。训练一结束，敌人就命令我到北半部来进行特务活动。起先我不愿意干，一个美国间谍系统的美军上尉就拿出手枪恫吓我。在敌人的威胁下，我无可奈何地接受了特务的任务，被他们用船送到朝鲜北部海岸，偷偷登陆。由于良心的责备，我到了北半部以后就向祖国内务机关自首了。”
