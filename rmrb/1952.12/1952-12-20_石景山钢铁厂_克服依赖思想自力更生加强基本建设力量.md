    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

    Overcomes Dependence, Relies on Self-Reliance, and Strengthens Basic Construction Forces

    The leading cadres of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have reversed the ideas of not valuing basic construction and relying on higher authorities. Currently, they have shifted the focus of leadership to basic construction, and have begun to vigorously transfer cadres and carry out intensive preparatory work, giving the basic construction department a new look.

    Over the past three years, through the efforts of all employees, production at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has rapidly recovered, and various major products have exceeded the highest levels before liberation by several times. In the past three years, the work of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the factory has basically revolved around the policy of restoring production; the factory's basic construction department has also mainly served production. Therefore, the idea of "production first" and "everything serves production" has been firmly established among the leading cadres. This was of course correct during the recovery period, but as the high tide of large-scale economic construction is about to arrive, the factory's leading cadres have failed to change this idea in a timely manner. For example, the factory's basic construction department has always been a weak link, with few cadres and poor quality. Until November of this year, there were only more than two hundred workers. The production side, on the other hand, had strong cadres, well-staffed organizations, a solid foundation, and many activists. Therefore, it is necessary and possible to transfer a large number of cadres from production to strengthen the basic construction department. However, the factory's leading cadres have always believed that the factory's basic construction task is important and "mainly depends on the help of higher authorities," and they are not proactive or active in preparing for basic construction.

    Since the Ministry of Heavy Industry held a meeting of factory and mine directors, the factory's leading cadres have changed the above-mentioned erroneous ideas and quickly shifted the focus of leadership to basic construction. In the Party, two Party committee secretaries are responsible for leading basic construction. In administration, in addition to setting up a vice-director specifically responsible for leading basic construction, the director and the vice-director in charge of personnel will also focus their main energy on basic construction. In order to implement the spirit of the Central Committee, after returning from the Ministry of Heavy Industry's factory and mine director meeting, they immediately conveyed the spirit to the entire factory and organized discussions, so that everyone recognized the importance of "basic construction first" and "self-reliance." In terms of manpower, it was decided to transfer 50% of the old cadres, 61.1% of the engineers, and 64.7% of the technicians. The first batch of 141 people was assigned to the basic construction department on December 13. The three organizations of the design office, basic construction office, and engineering company were also formally established on the same day, and the main cadres have been fully equipped. Dozens of students newly assigned to the factory are all studying drawing and drafting. More than 1,200 workers have been added. At the same time, a large-scale winter training plan has been formulated to prepare for a general training of the existing basic construction staff before next spring. Technical schools for training various skilled workers are also being actively prepared. In order to better learn from the Soviet experience, the engineers responsible for design are stepping up their study of Russian. Many leading cadres will be sent to the Northeast in batches to learn basic construction experience. The newly established drilling team has begun to systematically explore geology and send cadres to various places to collect data. The 1953 plan will be completed soon.

    Although the factory has vigorously carried out mobilization work, some cadres still emphasized that "production cannot be separated" and lacked confidence in completing production tasks when transferring personnel. After repeated explanations and education by the Party and administrative leaders, these ideological situations have been gradually corrected. In fact, production has continued to rise in some places where cadres have been transferred. For example, four engineers were transferred from the iron smelting furnace one after another, but the entire month of November produced qualified pig iron, and the average daily output in the first week of December reached the highest record of the year.

    In order to prepare conditions for continuing to strengthen basic construction forces in the future, the factory also decided to systematically train a large number of apprentices as skilled workers in production.

### 石景山钢铁厂  克服依赖思想自力更生加强基本建设力量

    石景山钢铁厂
    克服依赖思想自力更生加强基本建设力量
    石景山钢铁厂的领导干部扭转了不重视基本建设和依赖上级的思想，目前已把领导重心转到了基本建设方面，开始大力抽调干部，进行紧张的准备工作，使基本建设部门呈现了一片新气象。
    石景山钢铁厂三年来经过全体职工的努力，生产迅速恢复，各种主要产品都超过解放前最高水平的数倍。在过去三年中，工厂的党、行政、工会、青年团的工作，基本上都是围绕着恢复生产的方针进行的；工厂的基本建设部门主要也是为生产服务。因此，在领导干部中就树立了牢固的“生产第一”“一切服务于生产”的思想。这在恢复时期当然是正确的，但在大规模的经济建设高潮即将到来的今天，该厂的领导干部却未能及时改变这种思想。如该厂基本建设部门过去一直是薄弱环节，干部少，质量差，到今年十一月份以前，工人只有二百多名。生产方面则是干部强，机构充实，工作有基础，积极分子很多。因此，从生产中大量抽调干部以加强基本建设部门，是必要的而且也是可能的。但是该厂的领导干部却一直认为该厂的基本建设任务重大，“主要得靠上级帮助”，对基本建设的准备工作不主动，不积极。
    自重工业部召开厂矿长会议之后，该厂领导干部改变了上述的错误思想，迅速地把领导重心转到了基本建设方面。党内分工由两个党委书记负责领导基本建设，行政上除设立专门负责领导基本建设的副厂长外，厂长和人事副厂长也将主要精力放在基本建设方面。为了贯彻中央的精神，他们在参加重工业部厂矿长会议回来之后，立即在全厂进行了传达，组织了讨论，使大家都认清“基本建设第一”和“自力更生”的重要意义。在人力方面，确定抽调百分之五十的老干部、百分之六十一点一的工程师百分之六十四点七的技术员。第一批共一百四十一名，已于十二月十三日分配到基本建设部门。设计处、基本建设处、工程公司三个机构也于同日正式成立，主要干部都已配备齐全。新近分配到厂的几十个学生，全部学习描图制图。工人增加了一千二百余人。同时制订了较大规模的冬训计划，准备在明春前将现有的基本建设职工普遍训练一次。培养各种技术工人的技术学校也正在积极筹备。为更好地学习苏联经验，负责设计的工程师们正加紧学习俄文。很多领导干部将分批派赴东北学习基本建设经验。新成立的钻探队已开始有计划地探测地质，并派遣干部到各处搜集资料。一九五三年的计划最近即可编制完毕。
    该厂虽然大力进行了动员工作，但在抽调人员时，部分干部仍有强调“生产离不开”和对完成生产任务缺乏信心的现象。经过党与行政领导上反复解释教育，这些思想情况都被逐步纠正了。实际上有些干部被抽调的地方，生产仍旧不断上升。如炼铁炉陆续调走了四个工程师，但十一月份全月的生铁都合格，十二月份第一周的生产平均日产量达到了全年最高记录。
    为了给以后继续加强基本建设力量准备条件，该厂并决定在生产方面有计划地培养大批学徒为技术工人。
