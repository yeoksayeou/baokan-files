Introduction to the Zhuang Ethnic Group of Guangxi

The Zhuang (pronounced "Zhuang") ethnic group is one of the larger ethnic minorities in China, with a large population, a long history, and a developed culture. The Zhuang people are diligent and brave, and have close relations with the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups in terms of economy, culture, and life. The Zuoyou River basin in Guangxi Province is the main distribution area of the Zhuang ethnic group. The Zhuang population in Guangxi Province is approximately 5.44 million, accounting for one-third of the total population of the province.

The Zhuang people have a common language – "Zhuang language." The Zhuang language has a unique grammatical structure and basic vocabulary, belonging to the Sino-Tibetan language family, Kam-Tai language group. "Zhuang language" is extremely beautiful, and it is even more intimate and moving when expressed in Zhuang poetry, Zhuang songs, and idioms.

The Zhuang people love to sing and are good at singing. Generally, both men and women can compose and sing their own songs. They often hold "po fairs" and "market fairs" for collective singing. This custom is still quite common now. Li Fu, the compiler of "Guangxi Tongzhi," once vividly described the singing of the Zhuang people: "...Young women, in groups of three or five in spring, gather fragrant herbs and pick emeralds on the mountains and riversides, singing for pleasure; young men also gather in groups of three or five, singing to meet them, singing in response to each other, continuing all day long..."

The name "Zhuang" comes from Han Chinese records. Tang Dynasty's Liu Zongyuan had five poems about Zhuang customs, but some people still don't think they are credible; secondly, Fan Chengda and Zhu Fu of the Song Dynasty both mentioned the Zhuang ethnic group in their works. Therefore, the name "Zhuang" existed at least in the Song Dynasty. Later, in the Yuan Dynasty history, there was a formal record of the Zhuang ethnic group. But this does not mean that the Zhuang ethnic group appeared in the Tang or Song Dynasties. According to preliminary research, the Zhuang ethnic group flourished as early as the prehistoric period. Some people have determined that the Stone Age relics discovered in Guangxi in the past were used by the ancestors of the Zhuang ethnic group, but this remains to be verified. In the historical period, the so-called Pu, Yue, Luo, Bin, Li, Liao, Liang, etc. were all different names for the Zhuang ethnic group in different eras and different regions. The "Mu Shi" chapter of the Book of Documents mentioned "Pu people". Many Zhuang people in Guangxi now also call themselves "Pu", or "Pu Nong", "Pu Min", "Pu Jiang", "Pu Zhou"; other fraternal ethnic groups also mostly call the Zhuang ethnic group "Pu Shuang".

"Mu Shi" is a record of the oath taken by King Wu of Zhou when he met at Muye to attack King Zhou of Shang. This happened three thousand years ago, which proves the long history of the Zhuang ethnic group.

The Zhuang ethnic group's socio-economy is dominated by agricultural economy, and rice is their main agricultural product. The Zhuang people call themselves "Buyi", which means people who plow the fields with harrows. The Zhuang ethnic group's socio-economic situation is generally similar to that of the Han ethnic group. The Zhuang people mostly live on plains, cultivate paddy fields, and have complete production tools and advanced production technology, so their economic life is also more advanced.

The Zhuang ethnic group has its own long-standing culture. Their ancestors admired bronze drums, which were extremely exquisite in shape and have been unearthed in large numbers. Some are judged to be objects from two thousand years ago. The Zhuang brocade woven by Zhuang women from silk floss is brilliantly patterned and is as famous as Sichuan brocade. In addition, there are Zhuang characters that change the organization of Chinese characters to record Zhuang scriptures.

The Zhuang ethnic group in Guangxi has had many great events of anti-aggression and anti-oppression in history, and many heroic figures have emerged. They have also made many contributions to China's modern revolutionary movement. During the Song Dynasty, Nong Zhigao led the Zhuang people in a struggle against oppression and established the Great Southern Kingdom in Yongzhou. During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, many Zhuang people participated in the vigorous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement, and Wei Changhui, one of the leaders of the Taiping Army, was a Zhuang person. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Zhuang people and people of all ethnic groups established Soviet power in more than ten counties in the Zuoyou River area and created the Red Seventh Army. Comrade Wei Baqun, one of the outstanding leaders at the time, was an outstanding son of the Zhuang people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many Zhuang youths galloped on the vast battlefield, fighting alongside the Han people. During the Liberation War, Zhao Shitong, a Zhuang person, led the Zhuang people in western Guangxi to launch guerrilla warfare in the Zuoyou River area, and established people's power in the vast guerrilla area, coordinating with the People's Liberation Army to fight against the enemy, and finally ended the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Guangxi.

Under the oppression of the reactionary rule of the past dynasties, the Zhuang people suffered discrimination, insult, exploitation, and massacre. Many Zhuang people were forced to conceal their ethnic identity. After liberation, under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's policies of equality, friendship, and unity among ethnic groups, the Zhuang people have achieved liberation politically, economically, and culturally. Representatives of the Zhuang people have been invited to participate in the National Day celebrations in the capital. Representatives of the Zhuang ethnic group also serve as members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In government agencies at all levels in Guangxi Province, there are approximately 30,000 Zhuang cadres. Among the 34 counties in the Zhuang area of ​​western Guangxi, 24 counties have carried out land reform. The Zhuang people in these areas have been liberated from the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class, and poor and hired peasants have been distributed land and other means of production. Due to the development of trade, the local and special products of the Zhuang people and other ethnic groups have changed from slow-moving to best-selling, and the daily necessities they need have also been supplied in large quantities. So far, 162 trade organizations have been established in the Zhuang area of ​​Guangxi. Trade companies and purchasing and marketing teams have been established in major counties and major market towns. The cultural and educational undertakings of the Zhuang ethnic group are also gradually developing. There are currently 7,500 elementary schools in the Zhuang area of ​​Guangxi, with approximately 500,000 children enrolled, more than double the number of children enrolled three years ago. There are also 65 middle schools. Zhuang students receive preferential treatment in accordance with government regulations. At the Second Plenary Session of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, representatives of the Zhuang ethnic group formally proposed the creation and development of a phonetic script for the Zhuang language to further meet the cultural needs of the Zhuang people. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has sent linguists to Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces to investigate the Zhuang language and help the Zhuang people create writing. Both the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing and the Guangxi branch have Zhuang language research classes dedicated to investigating and studying the Zhuang language.

According to the ethnic policies in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the "Implementation Outline of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government was established in the Zhuang-populated area of ​​western Guangxi. This is a people's government equivalent to an administrative office. It temporarily governs Baise, Longlin, Tianlin, Lingyun, Fengshan, Donglan, Tianyang, Tiandong, Pingguo, Debao, Jingxi, Zhenbian, Yongning, Mashan, Wuming, Long'an, Fusui, Zhendu, Daxin, Longjin, Chongzuo, Ningming, Shanglin, Yishan, Luocheng, Huanjiang, Hechi, Nandan, Tian'e, Xincheng, Du'an, Sanjiang, Shangsi, and the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region, a total of 33 counties and one autonomous region. It covers an area of ​​approximately 111,000 square kilometers; the population is approximately 6.2 million; it is the most populous ethnic autonomous region in the country. The region has 4.21 million Zhuang people, accounting for 67% of the total population of the region. With the establishment of the autonomous region, the Zhuang ethnic group and the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region will embark on a path of greater prosperity and happiness.

    广西僮族介绍
    僮（读“壮”）族是我国少数民族中一个较大的民族，人口众多，历史悠久，文化发达。僮族人民勤劳而勇敢，与汉族和其他兄弟民族在经济、文化、生活等方面的关系很密切。广西省左右江流域是僮族的主要分布地。广西全省僮族人口约计五百四十四万，占全省人口总数的三分之一。
    僮族人民有共同的语言——“僮话”。僮族语言有独特的语法结构和基本辞汇，属于汉藏语系，黔台语族。“僮话”极优美，表现在僮诗、僮歌和成语里的更是亲切动人。
    僮族人民喜爱唱歌，且善于唱歌，一般男女都能自编自唱。他们经常举行“坡会”、“墟会”，集体歌唱。现在这种风习还相当普遍。李绂修纂的“广西通志”中对僮族人民的歌唱曾有生动的描写：“……少妇于春时三五为伴，采芳拾翠于山椒水湄，歌唱为乐；少男亦三五为群，歌以赴之，一唱一和，竟日乃已……。”
    僮族这个名称出于汉文记载的，唐柳宗元曾有过五首僮俗诗，但有人还以为不足凭信；其次，在宋范成大和朱辅的著作中，都曾谈到僮族。因此至少在宋代已有了僮族的名称。再后，在元史内，更正式有了僮族的纪录。但是这并不是说僮族出现于唐代或宋代。据初步研究，僮族的繁衍早在先史时期。过去在广西发现的石器时代遗物，有些人判定为僮族祖先使用的东西，但尚待考证。在有史时期，所谓濮、越、骆、宾、俚、僚、俍等都是僮族在不同时代不同地区的不同称呼。尚书“牧誓”篇中就曾提及“濮人”，现在广西的僮人也很多自称为“濮”，或“濮侬”、“濮闵”、“濮姜”、
    “濮周”；各兄弟民族对僮族也多称为“濮爽”。
    “牧誓”是周武王进攻商纣时在牧野会师宣誓的纪录，是三千年前的事，这就可以证明僮族历史的悠久了。
    僮族社会经济以农业经济为主体，水稻是他们主要的农业生产。僮族自称为“布叶伊”，意思是用耙耕田的人。僮族的社会经济情况一般与汉族相近。僮族人民多住平地，耕种水田，且生产工具齐全，生产技术发达，因此经济生活也较进步。
    僮族有自己悠久的文化。其祖先崇尚铸铜鼓，形制极精美，出土的不少，有的判断为二千年前物。僮族妇女以丝绵织成的僮锦，文彩绚烂，和川锦齐名。此外更有变更汉字组织用以纪录僮经的僮字。
    广西僮族在历史上曾有过不少反侵略、反压迫的伟大事件，出现过不少英雄人物。对中国现代革命运动，也有过不少的贡献。宋代侬智高领导僮族人民进行反压迫斗争，曾在邕州建立大南国。在满清统治时期，不少僮族人民曾参加轰轰烈烈的太平天国革命运动，太平军领袖之一的韦昌辉即是僮族人。在第二次国内革命战争时期，在中国共产党领导下，僮族人民和各兄弟民族人民曾在左右江十余县建立了苏维埃政权，创立了红七军，当时杰出领导者之一的共产党员韦拔群烈士便是僮族人民的优秀儿子。抗日战争时期，许多僮族子弟曾驰骋在广大的战场上，与汉族人民并肩作战。在解放战争时期，僮族赵世同率领了桂西僮族人民在左右江一带展开游击战争，并建立了广大游击区的人民政权、配合人民解放军展开对敌斗争，最后结束了国民党反动派在广西的统治。
    僮族人民在历代反动统治的压迫下，受尽了歧视，侮辱、剥削和屠杀。不少僮族人民被迫隐瞒了自己的民族身分。解放以后，在毛主席的平等、友爱、团结的民族政策的光辉照耀下，僮族人民在政治上、经济上、文化上得到了翻身。僮族人民的代表曾被邀参加首都历次国庆节观礼。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会也有僮族代表任委员。在广西全省各级人民政府机关中，有僮族干部约三万人。现在桂西僮族地区三十四个县中，已有二十四个县进行了土地改革，在这些地区的僮族人民已从地主阶级的剥削压迫下得到了翻身，贫农雇农都分得了土地和其他生产资料。由于贸易工作的开展，僮族人民和其他各族人民的土产品和特产品已由滞销转为畅销，他们所需用的日用品也大量得到供应。广西僮族地区到目前为止，已建立了贸易机构一百六十二所。主要县份和主要的圩镇都已设立了贸易公司和购销小组。僮族的文化教育事业也在逐渐发展。在广西僮族地区现有小学七千五百所，就学儿童约五十万人，比三年前的就学儿童增加两倍以上，中学也有六十五所。僮族学生按照政府规定，都得到了优待。在中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次委员会扩大会议上，僮族代表正式提出了创造并发展僮族语言的拼音文字的建议，以进一步适应僮族人民的文化需要。中国科学院已派了语言学专家到广西、贵州、云南等省调查僮族的语言，帮助僮族人民创造文字。北京中央民族学院和广西分院都已设有僮族语言研究班，专门调查研究僮语。
    根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中的民族政策和“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，在广西西部僮族聚居区成立了桂西僮族自治区人民政府。这是相当于行署一级的人民政府，暂辖百色、隆林、田林、凌乐、凤山、东兰、田阳、田东、平果、德保、靖西、镇边、邕宁、马山、武鸣、隆安、扶绥、镇都、大新、龙津、崇左、宁明、上林、宜山、罗城、环江、河池、南丹、天峨、忻城、都安、三江、上思及大苗山苗族自治区等三十三个县和一个自治区。面积约十一万一千多平方公里；人口约六百二十余万；是全国民族自治区中人口最多的一个自治区。全区有僮族四百二十一万人，占全区总人口的百分之六十七。随着自治区的建立，僮族和自治区内的各族人民，即将走上更加繁荣和幸福的道路。
