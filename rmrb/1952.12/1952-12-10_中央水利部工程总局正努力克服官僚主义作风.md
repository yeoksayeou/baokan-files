Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The criticisms of our bureau by Comrades Song Huajie and Zhang Xiude, published in the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column, are correct. The Beijing Repair Factory, which is under our bureau, launched a patriotic production increase and economy campaign after the "Three-Anti" movement. Workers looked for shortcuts, tapped potential, and put forward rationalization proposals, which significantly improved work efficiency. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of workers for production, the factory proposed a reward method on July 26 and submitted it to our bureau for approval. We believed that the factory had not yet implemented enterprise management and cost accounting systems, and the proposed commission reward method was not appropriate enough, so we replied to the factory on August 7, asking the factory to re-formulate a periodic reward method based on the actual situation. The factory then drafted a quarterly periodic reward method on October 11 and submitted it to our bureau. Although we approved the reward method on October 20, we did not notify the factory to implement it, and it has been held up until now. This shows that there is a serious bureaucratic work style in our work of not solving problems. We are now conducting inspections in conjunction with the anti-bureaucracy movement, and this criticism from readers is beneficial to our anti-bureaucracy movement.
    In order to properly handle this matter, we have decided to immediately allocate the factory's third-quarter bonus.

### 中央水利部工程总局正努力克服官僚主义作风

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央水利部工程总局正努力克服官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登的宋华杰、张修德两同志对我局的批评是正确的。我局所属北京修配厂，在“三反”运动后开展了爱国增产节约竞赛运动。职工找窍门、挖潜力、提出合理化建议，使工作效率显著地提高了。该厂为了鼓舞职工生产热情，曾在七月二十六日提出奖励办法，报请我局批准。我们认为该厂还没有实行企业化管理和成本核算制度，所拟提成奖励办法又不够妥当，就在八月七日批复该厂，叫该厂根据实际情况，重新拟订一种定期奖励办法。该厂又在十月十一日拟订了分季定期奖励办法，报到我局。我们虽然在十月二十日批准了该项奖励办法，但是并没有通知该厂实行，一直积压到现在。这说明我们工作中存在着严重的不解决问题的官僚主义作风。现在我们正结合反官僚主义运动进行检查，读者这一批评是有利于我们的反官僚主义运动的。
    为了恰当地处理这件事情，我们已决定立即拨付该厂第三季度的奖金。
    中央人民政府水利部工程总局
