(I) The Geoje-do Massacre is the Evil Result of the United Nations' Illegal Resolution

The massacre at the Geoje-do prisoner-of-war camp is the greatest challenge posed by the American aggressors to the people of Korea and China and to human morality. It is also the first serious evil result of the United Nations General Assembly's illegal resolution on the Korean question, passed based on the Indian proposal. The crimes of the American murderers on Geoje-do far exceed any previous massacres they committed on the island, and the reason for this lies in the fact that the United Nations General Assembly's illegal resolution condoned and encouraged the American murderers. Therefore, we must not only lodge the most serious protest with the U.S. government again but also make a solemn demand of the United Nations General Assembly.

Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, in his telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Pearson, on December 21st, strongly protested the crimes of the American aggressors on Geoje-do, demanded the severe punishment of the American officials who bear full responsibility for the successive massacres of prisoners of war, and demanded that the United Nations General Assembly rescind the illegal resolution on the Korean question. We resolutely support this protest and demand, and we are determined to fight for its realization. Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out in his telegram:

"The Geoje-do massacre is not only an expansion and development of the American army's consistent policy of massacring prisoners of war but also a direct result of the encouragement provided by the United Nations General Assembly's passage of the above-mentioned illegal resolution. This incident once again fully proves that the actual content of the American so-called 'voluntary repatriation' or 'non-forcible repatriation' principle is to coerce prisoners of war into expressing 'unwillingness to be repatriated' through inhumane collective massacres, in order to achieve their aim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war."

This is an extremely important analysis of the United Nations General Assembly's illegal resolution and the American plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

The United Nations' illegal resolution fundamentally constitutes a clear condoning and encouragement of the crimes of the American murderers, and it is based on the American so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation," which is, in fact, the sinister aim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Despite claims that the "Indian proposal on which the United Nations resolution is based is based on the Geneva Convention and international law," the facts prove that this is completely untrue.

In his speech to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on November 24th, the American Acheson admitted that the Indian proposal was "handling the issue of prisoners of war based on the principle of not using force"; the British delegation attending this session of the United Nations General Assembly also acknowledged in a statement issued on November 23rd that the Indian proposal "fully preserves the principle of non-forcible repatriation," and said that "no representative denied this in the debate." The United States Information Service reported on November 27th that at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on November 27th, "nine countries praised the Indian proposal, saying that this proposal upheld the principle of voluntary repatriation of prisoners of war." The issue is already very clear. That is to say, the United Nations' illegal resolution, passed based on the Indian proposal, is a complete replica of the American so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" absurd "principle," and it is completely different from the Geneva Convention and international law.

Article 118 of the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." This article also stipulates: "If no stipulation regarding the above is made in the armistice agreement concluded by the belligerents, or if such an agreement cannot be reached, the detaining Power shall itself draw up and execute a plan of repatriation in accordance with the principles laid down in the foregoing paragraph without delay." That is to say, after the cessation of active hostilities, prisoners of war must be unconditionally and promptly repatriated in their entirety; the country detaining the prisoners of war must not violate this principle or delay repatriation under any pretext. However, after superficially acknowledging that the repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, the United Nations' illegal resolution immediately violated the provisions of the Geneva Convention, absurdly stating something like "No force should be used on prisoners of war to compel them to return home," and a whole host of nonsense. Is this not a replica of the American so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle"! It is very obvious that this so-called "not using force to compel them to return home" is first acknowledging the American fabrication that "prisoners of war are unwilling to return home," created by brutal massacre, and then using the words "not using force to compel them to return home" to affirm the content of so-called "voluntary repatriation." Therefore, this illegal resolution of the United Nations will inevitably further condone and encourage the American murderers to use inhumane collective massacre methods to coerce prisoners of war into "refusing repatriation," in order to achieve their aim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

The American murderers say repeatedly that their "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" is "respecting the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention," however, it is precisely these murderers who are constantly carrying out large-scale massacres of prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camps, attempting to force prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation." In the past year, according to the figures admitted by the American authorities and the International Committee of the Red Cross alone, as many as three thousand captured personnel from Korea and China have been killed or wounded. The United Nations General Assembly not only does not condemn this completely inhumane criminal behavior of the United States but instead passes illegal resolutions to encourage the United States to further destroy humanity. It is precisely under this encouragement from the United Nations that the American imperialists dared to manufacture the unprecedented Geoje-do massacre case even more rampantly. This shows that the United Nations' illegal resolution bears an inescapable responsibility for the Geoje-do massacre.

People have already seen that, after the passage of the United Nations' illegal resolution, the American State Department's statement on December 15th arrogantly said, "The United States Government reiterates its determination to continue to fulfill its responsibilities in Korea"; Eisenhower's statement upon returning to the United States from Korea also openly stated that he would "resolve the matter with action." Clearly, the United Nations' illegal resolution has become a tool for the United States to recklessly prepare to launch new military adventures. The United States is using this illegal resolution to extort cannon fodder from its satellite countries, attempting to further drag its satellite countries into sharing responsibility for its war of aggression. Therefore, the United Nations' illegal resolution will inevitably produce more serious evil results. The unprecedented massacre case manufactured by the United States at the Geoje-do prisoner-of-war camp is a preliminary exposure of these more serious evil results. People must see the seriousness of this evil result and urgently take effective measures to resolutely stop it. To this end, all peace-loving people should support the solemn proposition put forward by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to Pearson in his telegram of December 21st to the United Nations General Assembly. This proposition is:

"In view of the fact that the above-mentioned illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly has already caused such serious and evil results, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the United Nations General Assembly should accept the suggestion I put forward in my reply telegram to you on December 14, 1952, to rescind the above-mentioned illegal resolution, order the U.S. government to immediately resume the Panmunjom armistice negotiations, and implement a comprehensive armistice in accordance with the already agreed draft Korean armistice agreement, and then hand over the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war to the 'Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question' as suggested by the Soviet delegation for resolution. Only in this way can the massacre of prisoners of war be immediately stopped, and the Korean armistice be immediately realized."

This proposition is not only fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Convention but also the only fair and reasonable one. We firmly believe that the peace-loving people of the world will support this proposition and strive for its realization. The declaration of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress is a clear proof. If the American aggressors are determined to be enemies of the peace-loving people and are determined to implement their unreasonable proposition with new adventurous actions, then, with the support of the world's peace-loving people, the Korean and Chinese people will surely inflict even more serious and more shameful failures on those war maniacs.

### （一）蜂岩岛惨案是联合国非法决议的恶果

    （一）蜂岩岛惨案是联合国非法决议的恶果
    蜂岩岛战俘营的大屠杀案件，是美国侵略者向朝中人民和人类道德举行的一次最大挑战，也是联合国大会根据印度提案所通过的关于朝鲜问题非法决议的第一个严重恶果。美国杀人犯在蜂岩岛上的罪行远远超过了他们在巨济岛上任何一次大屠杀的罪行，其原因就在于联合国大会的非法决议纵容与鼓励了美国杀人犯。因此，我们不但要向美国政府再次提出最严重的抗议，并且要向联合国大会提出严正的要求。
    我国周恩来外长十二月二十一日致电联合国大会主席皮尔逊，严重抗议美国侵略者在蜂岩岛的罪行，要求严惩对历次屠杀战俘事件负有全部责任的美国官员，并要求联合国大会取消关于朝鲜问题的非法决议。我们坚决拥护这个抗议和要求，坚决为其实现而奋斗。周外长在电文中指出：
    “蜂岩岛的大屠杀案，不仅是美国军队一贯屠杀战俘政策的扩大和发展，而且是在联合国大会通过上述非法决议的直接鼓励之下造成的。这个事件，又一次充分地证明了美国所谓‘自愿遣返’或‘不强迫遣返’原则的实际内容，就是用惨无人道的集体屠杀来胁迫战俘表示‘不愿遣返’，以便达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。”
    这对于联合国大会的非法决议和美国强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，是一个极端重要的分析。
    联合国的非法决议在根本上是对于美国杀人犯的罪行做了明显的纵容与鼓励的，它是以美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留战俘的罪恶目的为出发点的。尽管有人说什么“联合国决议所根据的印度提案是以日内瓦公约和国际法为根据的”，然而，事实证明完全不是这样。
    美国的艾奇逊在十一月二十四日联合国大会政治委员会的发言中，承认印度提案是“根据不得使用武力的原则处理战俘问题”的；出席本届联合国大会的英国代表团在十一月二十三日发表的声明中，也承认印度提案“完全保留了不强迫遣返的原则”，并且说“在辩论中没有任何代表否认这一点”。美国新闻处在十一月二十七日报道说，在十一月二十七日的联合国大会政治委员会上，“有九个国家赞扬印度提案，说这个提案维护了自愿遣返俘虏的原则。”这问题已经是非常明显的了。这就是说：根据印度提案所通过的联合国的非法决议彻头彻尾是美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”的荒谬“原则”的翻版，它与日内瓦公约和国际法是绝不相同的。
    日内瓦公约第一百一十八条明确规定“实际战事终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。”这个条文还规定：“冲突各方为停战而缔结之协定中，如无关于上述事项之规定，或不能成立此项协定者，各拘留国应即依照前项所定之原则，自行制定并执行遣返计划，不得迟延。”这就是说：在实际战事终止以后，战俘必须无条件地、迅速地全部遣返；拘留战俘的国家不得以任何藉口来违反这个原则或迟延遣返。但是，联合国的非法决议在表面承认了战俘的遣返应按照日内瓦公约的规定执行之后，立刻又违反日内瓦公约的规定，荒谬绝伦地说什么“不应对战俘施用武力以强使他们回返家乡”等一大套胡言乱语。这不是美国的所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”的翻版又是什么呢！明显得很，这种所谓“不以武力强使回家”就是首先承认美国以残暴屠杀手段制造的所谓“战俘不愿回家”的胡说，然后用“不以武力强使回家”的字眼来肯定所谓“自愿遣返”的内容。因此，联合国这一非法决议就必然更加纵容与鼓励了美国杀人犯用惨无人道的集体屠杀手段，来胁迫战俘“拒绝遣返”，以便达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    美国杀人犯口口声声说他们的“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”是“尊重日内瓦公约的人道原则”的，然而，正是这批杀人犯在战俘营中不断地大规模屠杀战俘，企图强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”。过去一年中，仅仅就美国官方和红十字国际委员会所承认的数字来说，朝中被俘人员被打死打伤的就已达到三千人。联合国大会对于美国这种完全是摧毁人道的罪恶行为不仅不加以丝毫谴责，反而通过非法决议来鼓励美国进一步毁灭人道。正是在联合国的这种鼓励之下，美帝国主义者才敢于更猖狂地制造了蜂岩岛大屠杀案。这就说明联合国非法决议对蜂岩岛大屠杀事件负有不可逃避的责任。
    人们都已经看到，在联合国非法决议通过之后，美国国务院十二月十五日的声明，气焰嚣张地说
    “美国政府重申决心，它要继续执行它在朝鲜的责任”；艾森豪威尔从朝鲜回到美国时所发表的声明，也已公然表示要“用行动来解决”。显然的，联合国的非法决议已经成为美国放肆准备发动新的军事冒险的工具了。美国正利用这个非法决议去向它的仆从国家勒索炮灰，企图更进一步拉着它的仆从国家为它的侵略战争分担责任。因此，联合国的非法决议将要不可避免地产生更严重的恶果。美国在蜂岩岛战俘营中所制造的空前大屠杀案件，则是这种更严重的恶果的初步暴露。人们必须看到这个恶果的严重性，紧急地采取有效的措施，加以坚决的制止。为此，一切爱好和平的人们，都应该支持我国周恩来外长在十二月二十一日致皮尔逊的电文中向联合国大会提出的严正主张。这个主张就是：
    “鉴于联合国大会所通过的上述非法决议案业已造成了这样严重的罪恶结果，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，联合国大会应该接受我在一九五二年十二月十四日给你的复电中所提出的建议，取消上述非法决议，责成美国政府立即恢复板门店停战谈判，并根据已经达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，实行全面停战，然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交给苏联代表团所建议的‘和平解决朝鲜问题委员会’去解决。只有这样，才能使战俘屠杀事件立即终止，朝鲜停战立即实现。”
    这个主张不但是完全符合日内瓦公约的精神的，而且是唯一公平合理的。我们坚决相信全世界爱好和平的人民都要支持这个主张并为其实现而奋斗。维也纳世界人民和平大会的宣言就是明显的证明。如果美国侵略者坚决要与爱好和平人民为敌，决心用新的冒险行动来贯彻他的无理主张，那么，在世界爱好和平人民的支持之下，朝中人民必将使那些战争疯狂者遭受到更加严重、更加可耻的失败。
