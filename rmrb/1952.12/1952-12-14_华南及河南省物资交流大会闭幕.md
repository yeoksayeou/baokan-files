    South China and Henan Province held a materials exchange conference from mid-November to early December.
    The South China Materials Exchange Conference was held in Guangzhou from November 17 to December 6. During the 15-day transaction period, the total purchase and sale value reached 2,950 billion yuan. Among these, spot goods accounted for 23.48 percent, and futures accounted for 76.52 percent; local and special product transactions accounted for 46 percent, and industrial product transactions accounted for 54 percent. The third Henan Province Materials Exchange Conference, held in Zhengzhou City from November 11 to 27, achieved a total transaction value of over 527.8 billion yuan.
    Before the opening of these two conferences, the local people's governments mobilized, educated, and organized private merchants. After the conferences opened, the conference leadership encouraged and helped private merchants to conduct transactions from all aspects. Therefore, private merchant transactions were very active. For example, at the South China Materials Exchange Conference, state-owned trading departments appropriately adjusted the prices of nine major categories of 140-plus commodities, including local and special products, cotton cloth, general merchandise, petroleum, industrial equipment, oils and fats, tea, coal, and feathers, which greatly promoted the enthusiastic transactions of private merchants at the conference. The local sugar produced in Guangdong Province had previously suffered from high prices in the producing areas, making transportation and sales unprofitable, which seriously affected sales. This time, the conference appropriately lowered the prices in the local sugar producing areas, resulting in huge transaction volumes. The tennis shoes produced in Guangzhou City were priced at 348,500 yuan per dozen in Guangzhou City, but when transported to the Zhujiang Special District, the list price was even lower than in the producing area, only 341,000 yuan per dozen. This made it unprofitable for private merchants to transport them, and state-owned trading companies also found it difficult to take over sales, leading to stockpiles in the producing areas and shortages in the selling areas. After appropriately increasing the list price in the selling areas this time, private merchants began purchasing. The No. 2 kerosene supplied by the state-owned oil and fat company had always been transported from Guangzhou to Jiangmen, Huizhou, and other places, and then resold to the surrounding villages. In the past, due to unreasonable regional price differences and small urban-rural price differences, private merchants only transported between Guangzhou City and Jiangmen City and Huizhou City, leaving the vast rural areas without kerosene supply. After this price adjustment, kerosene has begun to be sold to the vast rural areas surrounding Guangzhou City. Private merchants accounted for 59.09 percent of the total purchase amount and 56.08 percent of the total sales amount in the transactions at the South China Materials Exchange Conference. The number of private merchant representatives from primary markets participating in the third Henan Province Materials Exchange Conference reached 1,227, accounting for about 70 percent of the total number of representatives attending the conference. Through the exchange conference, a large number of industrial products were brought to the countryside. The sales of various fine cloth to primary markets alone reached more than 80,000 bolts, and the total value of other daily necessities and various stationery items also reached more than 53.59 billion yuan. The sales volume of more than ten major industrial products in Guangzhou City, such as matches, flashlights, and cotton textiles, during the conference was one to four times higher than the average monthly sales volume last year. The sales volume of toothpaste was more than eight times the monthly sales volume in the third quarter of this year. More than 5,000 small producers of shoe polish, toothbrushes, candles, etc., in Guangzhou City have also established new trade relations with trade representatives from the Southwest, North China, Central South, and various counties in the province. Many private industries in Guangzhou City not only sold their original stockpiled goods but also accepted orders for deliveries up to February and March of next year. The large volume of purchases and sales by private merchants, the many small transactions, and the wide variety of commodities transacted are the characteristics of these two conferences, indicating that the conferences have achieved significant success in taking care of legitimate private merchants and giving play to their business enthusiasm.
    In order to consolidate the achievements, the South China Materials Exchange Conference established a contract execution supervision and processing inspection committee after its closing to comprehensively inspect the execution of all contracts signed at the conference on a monthly basis.

    华南及河南省物资交流大会闭幕
    华南及河南省于十一月中旬到十二月上旬举行了物资交流大会。
    华南物资交流大会于十一月十七日至十二月六日在广州举行。大会在十五天的交易中，购销总值达二万九千五百亿元。其中现货占百分之二十三点四八，期货占百分之七十六点五二；土产品、特产品交易占百分之四十六，工业品交易占百分之五十四。自十一月十一日至二十七日在郑州市举行的河南省第三届物资交流大会，成交总额五千二百七十八亿多万元。
    这两个大会开幕前，当地人民政府对私商进行了动员、教育和组织工作，大会开幕后，大会领导方面又从各方面鼓励和帮助私商进行交易，因此，私商成交非常活跃。如在华南物资交流大会中，国营贸易部门适当调整了土产品和特产品、棉布、百货、石油、工业器材、油脂、茶叶、煤炭和羽毛九大类一百四十多种商品的价格，对私商在会上的踊跃成交，起了很大的推动作用。广东省出产的土糖，过去因产区价格偏高，运、销无利，严重影响了销售，这次大会适当调低了土糖产区的价格，成交额巨大。广州市出产的网球鞋，在广州市每打售价是三十四万八千五百元，但运至珠江专区，牌价比产区还低，每打只值三十四万一千元，这样，私商贩运无利，国营贸易公司包销也很困难，形成产区积压，销区脱销的情况，这次把销区牌价适当提高后，私商便开始采购了。由国营油脂公司供应的二号煤油，一向是从广州运销江门、惠州等地，再转销四乡。过去因地区差价不合理，城乡差价小，因此私商仅在广州市与江门市、惠州市之间贩运，对广大农村却没有煤油供应，经这次调整价格后，煤油已开始销向广州市四周的广大农村。私商在华南物资交流大会的交易中占购进总额的百分之五十九点零九，占销售总额的百分之五十六点零八。参加河南省第三届物资交流大会的初级市场的私商代表达一千二百二十七人，约占到会代表总数的百分之七十。通过交流会，使大批工业品下乡。仅各种细布销往初级市场的达八万多匹，其他日用百货和各种文具总值也达五百三十五亿九千余万元。广州市十多种主要工业产品如火柴、电筒、棉织品等在大会期间的销售量，等于去年每月平均数一倍到四倍多。牙膏销售量达到今年第三季度月销售量的八倍多。广州市五千多家的鞋油、牙刷、蜡烛等小生产者也已和西南、华北、中南各区及省内各县的贸易代表建立了新的贸易关系。广州市的许多私营工业，不但把原来积压着的现货销售出去，而且接受了至明年二三月的订货。私商购销多，小宗交易多，成交商品种类多，是这两个大会的特点，说明大会在照顾正当私商，发挥他们的经营积极性方面，有显著的成就。
    为了巩固成绩，华南物资交流大会在闭幕以后，成立一个合同执行监督处理检查委员会，以便按月全面检查在大会上签订的所有合同的执行情况。
