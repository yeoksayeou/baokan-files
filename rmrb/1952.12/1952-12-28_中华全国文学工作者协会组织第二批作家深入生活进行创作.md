    Following the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' organization of the first group of writers to go deep into life in March of this year, the All-China Federation of Literary Workers recently organized a second group of more than thirty writers and young artists to go deep into life for creative work. In addition to Chen Xuechao, Kang Tuo, Li Zhihua, Sun Li, Shu Wei, Yu Lin, and others who had already departed earlier, the other writers gathered in Beijing in November of this year. After a short period of study, they have also departed or are about to depart separately to factories, rural areas, and the Korean front. Among them, Zhou Libo, Li Ji, Lu Mei, Xu Chi, Shao Zinan, Luo Dan, and Xie Tingyu went to factories; Ai Qing, Qin Zhaoyang, Bian Zhilin, Si Qi, Wan Li, Gu Yu, Zhang Wanyi, Cui Xuan, Bai Wei, Lu Di, Lin Man, Sha Hong, Sun Junqing, Xing Libin, Ge Bizhou, and Wang Pixiang went to rural areas; and Lu Ling, Li Weishi, and Wang Ming went to the Korean front.

    Before their departure, during a short period of study, they first studied Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," and then studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and Malenkov's report. They also focused on studying the part about literature and art in Malenkov's report. Based on the spirit of these documents, and in connection with the current situation of literary and artistic work in our country and their own creative thoughts, they deeply discussed the issues of creating new characters, creating typical characters, and using language.

    During the study period, Hu Qiaomu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, convened a forum for the writers and gave a report on "Ideological Issues Concerning Literary and Artistic Work" based on some of the questions raised by the writers. He explained the environment and tasks of our country's literary and artistic work and also elaborated on the principles of socialist realism in light of the current situation of literary and artistic creation, requiring writers to create typical advanced figures who are positive, brilliant, and worthy of emulation by the people of the whole country; he also emphasized that only when writers first stand in the advanced ranks of the working class can they complete this glorious responsibility.

    Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, expressed detailed opinions on how to go deep into life and accept the national heritage during a forum with this group of writers.

    In addition, during the learning process, the writers also listened to reports organized by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee on industrial production, trade union work, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the implementation of the Marriage Law; held forums and discussions on issues such as experiencing life and poetry creation, and exchanged experiences.

    Through this study, the writers' enthusiasm and confidence in creation have greatly increased. Before their departure, they all formulated specific plans for going deep into life and preparing for creation, striving to create works loved by the working people.

    中华全国文学工作者协会组织第二批作家深入生活进行创作
    继今年三月中华全国文学艺术界联合会组织第一批作家深入生活后，中华全国文学工作者协会最近又组织了第二批作家和青年文艺工作者共三十多人深入生活，进行创作。这一批作家除陈学昭、康濯、李之华、孙犁、束为、俞林等已先期分别出发外，其他作家在今年十一月间集中到北京，经过一个短时期的学习后，也已分别出发或即将出发到工厂、农村和朝鲜前线去。其中到工厂的有周立波、李季、鲁煤、徐迟、邵子南、罗丹、谢挺宇；到农村去的有艾青、秦兆阳、卞之琳、思奇、万力、谷峪、张万一、崔璇、白危、陆地、林漫、莎蕻、孙峻青、邢立斌、戈壁舟、王丕祥；到朝鲜前线去的有路翎、李维时、汪明。
    在出发以前的短期学习中，他们首先学习了斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”，在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说和“马克思主义与语言学问题”，又学习了毛主席的“矛盾论”和马林科夫的报告。并着重地研究了马林科夫报告中关于文学艺术的部分。他们还根据这些文件的精神，联系我国当前文艺工作的状况和各人的创作思想，深入地讨论了创造新人物、创造典型与运用语言等问题。
    在学习期间，中共中央宣传部副部长胡乔木曾召集作家们进行座谈，并根据作家们提出的一些问题，作了“关于文艺工作的思想问题”的报告。他说明了目前我国文学艺术工作所处的环境及其任务，还结合文艺创作的现状阐释了社会主义现实主义的原则，要求作家创造出积极的、光辉灿烂的、值得全国人民仿效的先进人物的典型；他并着重指出只有作家首先站到工人阶级的先进行列中，才能完成这一光荣的职责。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬在和这批作家举行座谈时，曾就如何深入生活和接受民族遗产等问题详尽地发表了意见。
    此外，在学习过程中，作家们还听取了中共中央宣传部所组织的关于工业生产、工会工作、农村互助合作运动、贯彻婚姻法等问题的报告；举行了关于体验生活和诗歌创作等问题的座谈会和讨论会，交流了经验。
    经过这次学习，作家们创作的热情和信心大大提高，在出发前都订立了深入生活和准备创作的具体计划，努力争取创作出为劳动人民所喜爱的作品。
