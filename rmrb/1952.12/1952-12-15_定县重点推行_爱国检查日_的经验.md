    Ding County Emphasizes the Promotion of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" Experience
    Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    In Ma Wangzhuang, Ninth District of Ding County, Hebei Province, the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system was established during the Patriotic Pact movement last year. This system has regularized and institutionalized the village's current affairs and political propaganda work. It has become one of the important methods to promote the patriotic production increase and economy movement. The Ding County Committee of the Communist Party of China focused on studying and introducing the experience of Ma Wangzhuang in establishing "Patriotic Inspection Day" at the district committee secretary joint meeting held in June this year and at the propagandist representative meeting held in July, and proposed in the propaganda network work plan for the second half of the year to strive to universally hold "Patriotic Inspection Day" in villages with conditions throughout the county. As of the end of September, 49 villages had established the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, and the county is continuing to promote it.

    In the villages that have established the "Patriotic Inspection Day," due to the regular patriotic education received by the masses, their political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm have been unprecedentedly improved. A strong political atmosphere and active patriotic actions have emerged in every village. Patriotic pacts have been regularly and mass-checked and revised, promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the villages, which has led to a general increase in agricultural production this year. Qijiazhuang in the Ninth District is the most prominent example. In the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities, this village constantly revised the patriotic pact. Out of 273 households in the village, 271 participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in the village increased from one to nine. Yang Zhaoxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative's 2.6 mu of high-yield millet yielded 970 jin per mu; the cooperative's general millet yield (dry land suffered a slight drought) increased from 150 jin last year to 300 jin. In this year's anti-drought wheat planting campaign, the entire village actively launched a competition, using all available water sources and planning to dig seven new wells (three have been completed) and buy six waterwheels to ensure the completion of the 1,250 mu wheat planting task. In each "Patriotic Inspection Day" activity, Ma Wangzhuang not only conducted political education, but also constantly democratically revised the patriotic pact. Each household formulated specific plans based on the village's patriotic pact, ensuring the completion of the village's production plan. In this spring's anti-drought campaign, the plan was to dig eight wells, but there were no bricks at the kiln. Under the encouragement of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" meeting, everyone gathered bricks to dig wells. The masses concentrated more than 20,000 bricks at once, and eight wells were dug in ten days. Last year, Ma Wangzhuang applied an average of 15.6 jin of fine fertilizer per mu of millet; this year, the average was 36 jin per mu. Wang Yanke, a member of the Young Women's League, used the money she had prepared for her wedding dowry to buy 800 jin of fine fertilizer. In this way, the average millet yield of the entire village increased from 200 jin per mu to 307 jin, with a total increase of 70,773 jin of millet for the entire village.

    At the "Patriotic Inspection Day" meetings in various villages, farmers proposed competitions to each other, extensively mobilizing all male and female labor to participate in production. Sun Jizhu (women's team leader in the cooperative), a member of the Yang Zhaoxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qijiazhuang, had never been to the fields before. During the summer hoeing, she proposed a competition to her husband, Zhang Qingying (team leader), at the "Patriotic Inspection Day" meeting, and led twelve female cooperative members to hoe a total of 64 mu of yam and cotton in the cooperative. They happily sang songs such as "The East is Red" and "Wang Xiuluan" during production, and also learned to read during breaks in the fields. Sun Jizhu has learned more than 200 new characters, and Wang Tongge has learned 500 characters. Some lazy people in some villages have also been reformed in the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities. Wang Luoyun, who is over seventy years old, said, "The world has really changed!"

    "Patriotic Inspection Day" is also the most practical education for district and village cadres. They feel that the work is easier to do, and their work enthusiasm is even higher. Ma Suokui, the village chief of Qijiazhuang, said, "In the past, because my village's work was lagging behind, I would always find a 'dark corner' (dark room corner) to stand in when I went to the district to attend meetings, and I didn't want to see anyone; now when I attend meetings, I always stand on the 'high ground.'" Ding Junhua, secretary of the District Youth League Committee, said after visiting Ma Wangzhuang's "Patriotic Inspection Day," "Cadres will be abandoned by the masses if they don't make progress themselves!" The establishment of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system has reduced some unnecessary meetings in rural areas. Some problems are concentrated on this day to be solved, saving the masses' time and attracting more masses to care about the village's work. This is also one of the important improvements in the Party organization's working methods in rural areas. When Dong Matou Village in the Ninth District held its first "Patriotic Inspection Day," there were more than 100 organized people such as Party members and League members present, and very few ordinary people attended. When the third "Patriotic Inspection Day" was held, the number of people increased to 500, and elderly people who did not usually attend meetings also rushed to participate. An Mingrui, an old lady in her sixties, said, "The more I listen to these new things, the more I like to listen."

    The experience of Ding County in establishing the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system is:

    1. The Party committee attaches importance to the leadership of "Patriotic Inspection Day," timely summarizes and exchanges experiences, and the activities of "Patriotic Inspection Day" are closely integrated with the current central tasks, making it a driving force for promoting various tasks. The Ninth District Committee timely introduced the successful experience of Ma Wangzhuang in holding "Patriotic Inspection Day" at the cadre meeting. During the anti-drought campaign, the cadres of Ma Wangzhuang were allowed to introduce the experience of their village in mobilizing the masses to fight drought and dig wells through "Patriotic Inspection Day," and the District Committee organized cadres and propagandists from nearby villages to visit Ma Wangzhuang on the spot to learn how Ma Wangzhuang held "Patriotic Inspection Day" and checked and revised the patriotic pact. All the village cadres praised it after the visit. Ma Maosheng, the education cadre of the Yangjiaying District Committee, said, "If everyone is like this, the work will be easier to do."

    2. Before starting to hold "Patriotic Inspection Day," it is necessary to conduct full ideological mobilization among cadres and the masses. The Communist Party branch of Yangjiaying Village first studied it at the branch committee meeting, and then convened a meeting of Party members, League members, and propagandists. The branch secretary detailed the experience and effects of Ma Wangzhuang's "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities. After the meeting, Party members, League members, and propagandists went to the masses to carry out in-depth propaganda, making the masses of the whole village aware of the significance and methods of "Patriotic Inspection Day." When the first "Patriotic Inspection Day" was held, the focus was on publicizing the Marriage Law based on the situation in the village. Yang Luogao in the village originally planned to let his child who was not yet of marriageable age get married, but after listening to the propaganda about the harm of early marriage at the "Patriotic Inspection Day" meeting, he declared on the spot that he would not let his child get married early. When this village held its second "Patriotic Inspection Day," 800 people attended, 500 more than the first time, and the enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high. Niu Chuanju, a 63-year-old woman, not only actively participated herself, but also encouraged her daughter-in-law to participate.

    3. In the activities of "Patriotic Inspection Day," attention should be paid to promoting the spirit of democracy and the spirit of revolutionary competition. At the meeting, past work should be reviewed, and future work should be studied and planned. Each time there should be commendations and criticisms (more commendations than criticisms). In each "Patriotic Inspection Day" in Qijiazhuang, comparisons are made between the various agricultural production cooperatives and the various mutual aid groups. Each cooperative and group competes with each other to see who has the best performance in implementing the "Patriotic Pact" and which mutual aid group is the most consolidated. The village also set up a mobile red flag to reward the selected models. In this way, the activities of "Patriotic Inspection Day" consolidated and developed the work of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the village; conversely, the competition among the cooperatives and groups enriched the content of "Patriotic Inspection Day," thereby consolidating the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system.

    4. When holding "Patriotic Inspection Day," it is necessary to create a warm, lively, and joyful atmosphere to encourage everyone's political and production enthusiasm. In Qijiazhuang, on the day of each "Patriotic Inspection Day," the nine cooperatives and twelve mutual aid groups all put up red flags at the door, with the words "Challenging Cooperative/Group X" written on them. The national flag is raised in the school. Each household sets up a literacy board, which is replaced with new content according to the central content of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activity. When the masses see these new atmospheres, they know that "Patriotic Inspection Day" is to be held that day. In order to make it easier for the masses to form habits, it is best to choose days that are easy for the masses to remember for "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities, such as the first and fifteenth days of the month. However, when celebrating "Patriotic Inspection Day," attention should be paid to preventing the tendency of formalism.

    The Party's propaganda network must carry out activities around "Patriotic Inspection Day." A few days before holding "Patriotic Inspection Day," Yangjiaying first understands the thoughts and demands of the masses through propagandists, and determines the central content of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities based on the specific situation and the instructions of the higher authorities. Between the two "Patriotic Inspection Days," all propaganda activities focus on organizing the implementation of the patriotic pact. This not only makes the content of "Patriotic Inspection Day" more vivid and more suitable for the needs of the masses, but also makes the activities of propagandists more regular and more powerfully promotes the central work.

    The "Girl Stretcher Team" of Dajingli, Fengjili, and Mianchuanli, which are close to the Korean front, set off together with the village's "Support the Frontline Brigade." On the evening of October 29, the girls were so excited that they couldn't sleep. "Listen, it's our artillery, our artillery! It's firing so fiercely!" The good news of the Volunteer Army's counterattack on the 572.4 height came.
    "It's really annoying that you men go to support the front line, but you don't want us to participate! We have to go!" The girls were not convinced, and they organized themselves.
    "Dad, let's have a competition!" Jin Changkui's daughter challenged her father. "There are not many conditions, carry it steadily, walk fast, and be responsible for covering in case of bombing. Guarantee to carry the wounded Volunteer Army uncles to the hospital." (Photo by Li Feng and Gong Jiemin)

    定县重点推行“爱国检查日”的经验
    中国共产党河北省委宣传部
    河北省定县九区马王庄，在去年推行爱国公约运动中，建立了“爱国检查日”制度。这一制度，使村里的时事政治宣传工作经常化和制度化了。它成为推动爱国增产节约运动的重要办法之一。中共定县委员会在今年六月召开的区委书记联席会议和在七月间召开的宣传员代表会议上，着重研究并介绍了马王庄建立“爱国检查日”的经验，并在下半年的宣传网工作计划中提出争取在全县有条件的村庄普遍举办“爱国检查日”。到九月底为止，已有四十九个村庄建立了“爱国检查日”制度，全县正在继续推广。
    在建立了“爱国检查日”的村庄里，由于群众定期地受到爱国主义的教育，政治觉悟与爱国热情空前提高，村村出现了浓厚的政治空气与积极的爱国行动，爱国公约都得到定期的、群众性的检查和修订，推动了村里的互助合作运动，使今年农业生产普遍提高。九区齐家庄是最突出的例子。这个村在“爱国检查日”的活动中，不断地修订了爱国公约，全村二百七十三户，有二百七十一户参加了互助合作组织，村里的农业生产合作社由一个增加到九个。杨兆祥农业生产合作社的二亩六分丰产谷，每亩收九百七十斤；社内一般谷产量（旱田稍有旱灾）由去年的一百五十斤增加到三百斤。在今年抗旱种麦运动中，全村积极展开竞赛，将所有一切能利用的水源使用起来，并计划打新井七眼（已完成三眼），买水车六辆，保证完成一千二百五十亩的种麦任务。马王庄在每次“爱国检查日”活动中，除进行政治教育外，还不断地民主修订爱国公约，各户根据全村的爱国公约，具体地制订计划，保证了全村生产计划的完成。今春抗旱运动中计划打井八眼，但窑上没有砖；在“爱国检查日”会议的鼓动下，大家就凑砖打井，群众一次就集中了二万多块砖，十天打了八眼井。去年马王庄每亩谷子平均施细肥十五斤十两，今年每亩平均施肥三十六斤。女青年团员王彦科将准备结婚买嫁妆的款买了八百斤细肥。就这样，全村谷子产量平均由每亩二百斤增加到三百零七斤，全村总计增产谷子七万零七百七十三斤。
    各村在“爱国检查日”会议上，农民们相互提出竞赛，广泛地发动了全体男女劳动力参加生产。齐家庄杨兆祥农业生产合作社社员孙记竹
    （社内妇女队长），从来没有到过地里，夏锄时在“爱国检查日”会议上向丈夫张青英（队长）提出竞赛，并带动十二个女社员，包锄了社内的山药、棉花共六十四亩。她们在生产中愉快地唱着“东方红”和“王秀鸾”等歌子，还在地头上休息时学识字。孙记竹已学会二百多生字，王同格学会了五百个生字。有些村庄里的懒汉，也在“爱国检查日”活动中改造过来了。七十多岁的王洛云说：“现在的世道真是变了样！”
    “爱国检查日”对区、村干部也是最实际的教育。他们觉着工作好作了，因而工作热情更加提高。齐家庄村长马锁奎说：“过去因为我村工作落后，到区开会我尽找‘黑角落’（黑房角）站着，不愿见人；现在开会我尽站在‘高岗’上。”区团委书记丁俊花参观马王庄“爱国检查日”以后说：“干部自己不进步会被群众丢了去呢！”“爱国检查日”制度的建立，减少了农村一些不必要的会议，有些问题就集中到“爱国检查日”这天解决，节省了群众的时间，并且吸引更多的群众关心村里的工作。这也是党组织在农村工作方法上的重要改进之一。九区东马头村第一次过“爱国检查日”时，到会的有党员、团员等有组织的群众一百余人，一般群众到的很少；第三次过“爱国检查日”时，群众增到五百人，平时不常开会的老年人也赶来参加。六十多岁的老太太安明瑞说：“这?的新事我越听越爱听。”
    定县建立“爱国检查日”制度的经验是：
    一、党委重视“爱国检查日”的领导，及时总结和交流经验，“爱国检查日”的活动紧密结合当前中心任务进行，使它成为推动各种工作的动力。九区区委对马王庄举办“爱国检查日”的成功经验，及时在干部会议上进行介绍。抗旱运动中曾让马王庄的干部介绍了本村
    “爱国检查日”发动群众抗旱打井的经验，区委并组织了附近村的干部、宣传员到马王庄实地参观，学习马王庄举行“爱国检查日”的作法和检查修订爱国公约的经验。各村干部参观后一致称赞。杨家营区委教育干事马茂生说：“全像这样，工作就好作了。”
    二、开始举办“爱国检查日”前，要在干部和群众中进行充分的思想动员。杨家营村中共支部首先在支部委员会议上作了研究，然后召开了党、团员和宣传员会议，由支部书记详细介绍了马王庄“爱国检查日”活动的经验和效果，会后党、团员和宣传员分头包干向群众进行了深入宣传，使全村群众认识到“爱国检查日”的意义和作法。第一次举行“爱国检查日”时，根据本村情况，以宣传婚姻法为重点。村里杨洛高本来打算让不到结婚年龄的孩子结婚，但他在“爱国检查日”会议上听了关于早婚的害处的宣传之后，当场声明不让孩子早期结婚了。这个村第二次举行
    “爱国检查日”时，到会的有八百人，比第一次多五百人，群众情绪极为高涨。六十三岁的妇女牛喘菊不仅自己积极参加，还鼓励媳妇去参加。
    三、在“爱国检查日”的活动中，应注意发扬民主精神和革命竞赛的精神，会上要检查过去的工作，研究计划今后的工作，每次有表扬、有批评
    （表扬要多于批评）。齐家庄在每次“爱国检查日”，各个农业生产合作社之间，各个互助组之间，都进行评比。各社、组相互竞赛，看谁执行“爱国公约”的成绩好，又比赛那个互助组最巩固。村里并设置了流动红旗，奖励评选出来的模范。这样，“爱国检查日”的活动巩固和发展了村里农业生产合作社、互助组的工作；反过来，各社、组的竞赛又丰富了“爱国检查日”的内容，从而巩固了“爱国检查日”的制度。
    四、举行“爱国检查日”时，要造成一种热烈、活泼、愉快的气氛，以鼓励大家的政治情绪和生产情绪。齐家庄每到“爱国检查日”这天，九个社、十二个互助组，门口都插上红旗，上面写着向某社、某组挑战。学校里升起国旗。各家门口都设一块识字牌，根据“爱国检查日”的活动中心换上新内容。群众一见这些新气象，就知道这天要举行“爱国检查日”了。为了使群众易于形成习惯，“爱国检查日”活动最好选择群众易于记忆的日子，如初一、十五。但是在过“爱国检查日”时，应注意防止形式主义的偏向。
    党的宣传网要围绕“爱国检查日”进行活动。杨家营在举行“爱国检查日”的前几天，首先通过宣传员了解群众思想和要求，根据具体情况与上级指示，确定“爱国检查日”活动的中心内容。在两次“爱国检查日”之间，一切宣传活动即以组织实现爱国公约为中心内容。这样作不仅使“爱国检查日”内容更加生动，更加适合群众的要求，而且使宣传员的活动，更加经常化，更有力地推动中心工作。

    紧靠朝鲜前线的大井里、峰机里、绵川里的“姑娘担架队”，和村里的“支前大队”一道出发了。十月二十九日晚上，姑娘们兴奋得睡不着觉。“你听，是咱们的大炮，咱们的大炮呀！打得多凶！”志愿军反击五七二点四高地的喜讯传来了。
    “真讨厌，你们男子去支援前线，却想不让我们参加！我们非去不行！”姑娘们不服气，她们自己组织起来了。
    “爸爸，跟你比赛！”金长魁的女儿和父亲挑战了。“条件不用多，抬的稳当，走的快，遇到轰炸负责掩护。保证把受伤的志愿军叔叔抬到医院。”    （李风、宫洁民摄）
