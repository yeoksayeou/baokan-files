Pahatakili Township, Shufu County, Kashgar District, to all peasant comrades:

Thank you for your letter to me last March celebrating the victory of land reform. You have been liberated from the shackles of the feudal land ownership of the landlord class. I hope you will unite even more under the slogan of patriotic production increase, work hard to produce, improve your material life, and on this basis, gradually improve your cultural level.

Mao Zedong
August 30, 1952

When Chairman Mao's letter arrived in Pahatakili Township on October 16th, all the farmers in the township ran around spreading the good news. It quickly spread to villages far and wide in Kashgar. The next day, the farmers of Pahatakili Township held a celebration as if it were a grand festival. At the meeting, many emancipated Uyghur farmers spoke. They said: Our township has had three great happy events this year: first, Chairman Mao sent a letter; second, we were allocated land; and third, we had a bumper harvest of autumn crops. Many Uyghur farmers shed tears of happiness and gratitude when they talked about these three happy events.

Pahatakili Township is a large village on the outskirts of Shufu City, on the banks of the Kashgar River. The village is surrounded by extremely fertile paddy fields. Previously, most of these fertile fields were occupied by the landlord class. For example, out of the 634 households in the township, 226 had no land at all, and 140 households had an average of only 0.25 mu of land per person. After the pilot land reform in the township this spring, each farmer was allocated more than three mu of paddy fields, which is enough to maintain their livelihood.

One evening, while reporters were walking along the Kashgar River, they saw a Uyghur woman holding a child and working in the fields by the river. We greeted her and talked about the land reform and the bumper harvest. She excitedly pointed to the child she was holding and said, "This child is called Sila Ajiang (meaning construction)." Why is he called "Sila Ajiang"? She told a moving story: This spring, during the land reform, her family was allocated more than ten mu of paddy fields. On the third day after the land was distributed throughout the township, she gave birth to the child. This happy event attracted the attention of the farmers in the township, and everyone gave the newborn child the name "Sila Ajiang" and allocated him a vegetable garden of two mu. The next day, when we visited Sila Ajiang's family, his grandmother, father, and mother guided us to visit the vegetable garden. It was a very good vegetable garden! In addition to a patch of cabbage, there were many fruit trees. Baskets of freshly picked grapes were placed under the trellis, and ripe pears hung from the branches. The whole family felt infinite joy at the sight of this scene. When we arrived in the township, it was the harvest season. The farmers were busy harvesting rice while singing the joy of the harvest. The more than 5,500 mu of paddy fields cultivated by the farmers in the township all had a bumper harvest this year, with an increase of more than 500,000 catties of rice, an average increase of 800 catties per household. The farmers excitedly told us: In the past, a good harvest was considered to be 240 catties of rice per mu, but this year the average yield per mu in the township is 340 to 350 catties, and one-third of the paddy fields even yielded 400 catties per mu. Poor peasant Tursun Yiming created a yield of 750 catties per mu on the newly allocated land.

The bumper harvest has brought a happy life to the Uyghur farmers. The changes in the life of the family of hired laborer Tu Di Kasmu can fully prove this. His family of five lives in two rooms with wooden floors and glass windows, which were allocated during the land reform. This year, the 15 mu of rice he planted yielded more than 6,000 catties of rice. According to the usual household expenses, after deducting daily use, he will still have nearly 1,000 catties of rice left over to eat until next autumn. After calculating his income and expenses, Tu Di Kasmu said to us: "This year I bought a cow and can eat rice and white flour. This is something my father never dreamed of when he was alive." He then said: "When mentioning this year's bumper harvest, we cannot forget the help of the People's Liberation Army. During the spring plowing, we had many difficulties in production because we had just received the land. At that time, a unit of the People's Liberation Army sent 120 people and 54 livestock to help more than 200 poor farmers cultivate more than 1,700 mu of land. They also lent us 5,500 catties of selected seeds and 190 hoes. In addition, they gave our township ten horses free of charge."

After the bumper harvest in Pahatakili Township, a new atmosphere has emerged: new houses are being built everywhere, and people are buying large carts and livestock. According to our rough statistics, the township has built 22 new houses this year, and bought a total of 134 new horses, cattle, and donkeys, 11 new large carts, and more than 450 hoes and sickles.

The reporters stayed in the township for six or seven days, and every day they saw the joy of the emancipated farmers, saw them reading Chairman Mao's letter aloud in front of the blackboard newspaper, and heard them singing songs of gratitude to Chairman Mao.

    帕哈太克里乡三喜临门
    新华社记者　杜鹏程、王立忱喀什区疏附县帕哈太克里乡全体农民同志：
    感谢你们今年三月在庆祝土地改革胜利时写给我的信。你们已经从地主阶级封建土地所有制的束缚中获得解放，希望你们在爱国丰产的口号之下，更加团结，努力生产，改善自己的物质生活；并在这个基础之上，一步一步地提高自己的文化水平。
    毛泽东
    一九五二年八月三十日
    毛主席的信在十月十六日送到帕哈太克里乡时，全乡农民奔走四方报喜。很快就传遍了喀什噶尔远近的乡村。第二天帕哈太克里乡的农民们像过盛大的节日一样，举行了庆祝会。在这个会上，许多翻身后的维吾尔族农民都讲了话。他们说：我们乡里今年逢了三大喜：一是毛主席来了信；二是分到了土地；三是秋田获得了大丰收。有很多维吾尔族农民说到这三喜临门的事情时，流下了幸福、感激的眼泪。
    帕哈太克里乡是疏附城郊、喀什噶尔河畔的大村落。村子周围，是一片极肥沃的水田。以前这些肥美的田地，大部分为地主阶级所霸占，如该乡六百三十四户人家，其中就有二百二十六户人家没一分土地，有一百四十户人家，每人平均只有二分五厘土地。今年春天该乡试办土地改革后，每个农民都分得了三亩以上的水田，已足够维持生活了。
    一天傍晚，记者在喀什噶尔河边散步时，看见一个维吾尔族妇女，抱着孩子，坐在河边地里做活。我们和她打了招呼，并和她谈到土地改革和丰收的情形，她兴奋地指着怀里抱着的孩子说：“我这孩子叫斯拉阿江（即建设之意）。”为什么叫“斯拉阿江”呢？她讲述了一段动人的故事：今年春天土地改革中，她家里分得了十多亩水田。就在全乡分配土地后的第三天，她生下了孩子。这件喜事引起全乡农民们的注意，大家给这刚出世的孩子送了个“斯拉阿江”的名字，并给他分配了一座两亩地的菜园。第二天，我们去访问斯拉阿江的家庭时，他的祖母、父亲、母亲，引导我们参观了菜园。这是一座很好的菜园！除了一片白菜外，还有很多果树，摘下来的鲜葡萄一筐筐地放在架下；成熟欲坠的梨子，挂满枝头。全家人眼看着这种情景，都感到无限的喜悦。我们到达该乡时，正是收获的季节。农民们一面忙碌的收割着稻子，一面歌唱丰收的喜悦。该乡农民耕种的五千五百多亩稻田，今年都得到丰收，可增产稻谷五十万斤以上，每家人平均增产八百斤。农民们兴奋地向我们说：过去每亩稻子，打上二百四十斤稻谷就算是好收成，可是，今年全乡每亩地平均产量是三百四、五十斤，其中有三分之一的稻田，每亩还收到四百斤。贫农吐尔逊依明，在新分到的土地上，创造了每亩七百五十斤的产量。
    丰收给维吾尔族农民带来了幸福的生活。从雇农吐的卡斯木家庭的生活变化，可以得到充分证明。他家大小五口人，住着土地改革中分得的两间有地板和玻璃窗子的房子。今年他种的十五亩稻子，就收了六千多斤稻谷。按照平常农家费用计算：今年他收的粮食除日用外，吃到明年秋天还能剩下近千斤稻子。吐的卡斯木把他的收入和开支计算以后对我们说：“今年我买了一头牛，还能吃上大米、白面，这是我父亲在世时作梦也没梦到的事。”他接着又说：“提到今年的丰收，可不能忘记人民解放军对我们的帮助。春耕的时候，我们因为刚得到土地，所以生产中还有很多困难。当时人民解放军某部派来了一百二十个人和五十四头牲口，帮助我们二百多户贫苦农民耕了一千七百多亩地，还借给我们选好了的五千五百斤种子和一百九十把砍土镘。另外毫无代价地送给了我们乡上十匹马。”
    帕哈太克里乡丰收后，呈现一片新气象：到处是盖新房的、买大车的、买牲口的。据我们粗略的统计，全乡今年新修的房子有二十二座，新买的马、牛、驴共有一百三十四头，新买的大车十一辆，砍土镘、镰刀四百五十多把。
    记者在该乡住了六、七天，每天都看到翻身农民们的喜悦，看见他们围在黑板报前朗读毛主席的来信；还听到他们唱着感激毛主席的歌声。
