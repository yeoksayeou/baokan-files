    Learning from Soviet Experiences Improves Working Methods
    Editor: The Li Changqing team of the Power Workshop at the State-owned Handan Cotton Textile Factory, learning from advanced Soviet experiences, improved their screw-tightening tool, increasing installation efficiency by four times.
    In the past, when installing "motors," the Li Changqing team used to tighten screws by hand, which was not only slow but also strenuous, and some workers even hurt their hands. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," they studied the advanced experience of the Soviet "electric drill" and, based on the construction principles of the "electric drill," finally modified a tool for tightening screws. This tool is now officially in use and the results are excellent. In the past, when tightening screws by hand, they could only tighten two per minute, but now they can tighten nine to ten per minute.

    学习苏联经验改进了工作方法
    编辑同志：国营邯郸棉纺织厂动力车间李长清小组，学习苏联先进经验，改进拧螺丝工具，提高安装效率四倍。
    李长清小组过去安装“马达”时，用手拧螺丝，不但拧得慢，而且费劲，有的工人把手都拧痛了。在“中苏友好月”中，他们学习了苏联“电钻”的先进经验，根据“电钻”的构造原理，终于改制成一个拧螺丝的工具。这个工具现已正式使用，效果良好。过去用手拧螺丝时，每分钟只能拧二个，现在每分钟能拧九个至十个。    苑玉林
