    Correcting the Erroneous Practice of Overburdening Primary School Teachers with Social Work

    Many primary school teachers from various localities have written to reflect that currently, in many areas, primary school teachers are burdened with excessive social work, which seriously hinders their teaching and professional development. They urgently request that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and local Party and government leading organs take effective measures to resolve this issue.

    Party and government leading organs in many places arbitrarily assign extra work to primary school teachers, making their burdens unbearable. For example, the Armed Forces Department, Production Office, and other departments of the Sixth District People's Government of Wei County, former Chahar Province, frequently sent summary materials, reports, and forms to the teachers of Jijiazhuang Complete Primary School, located in the district People's Government seat, to be copied, and the quantities were very large. For example, one night in July, some teachers were already asleep, but the district People's Government sent some production material statistical tables and asked the teachers to copy them overnight. As a result, five or six teachers copied until 2 a.m. The next morning, when the students came to school, the teachers couldn't get up. Qu Heng, a member of the Eighth District Committee of the Communist Youth League in the county, arbitrarily summoned teachers to listen to his speeches and summoned principals to meetings, casually asking schools to prepare various forms and reports for him. He once asked Sun Yongrui, a teacher at Taohua Complete Primary School, to summarize materials for him, which took Sun Yongrui and four students a day and two nights to complete. More seriously, many areas do not hesitate to suspend primary school classes and arbitrarily transfer primary school teachers to work when central tasks arrive. Readers Hui Zheng and others from Deng County, Henan, wrote that the county's leading organs arbitrarily transfer primary school teachers to work when central tasks arrive, and often the transfers last for half a year. As a result, many primary schools are in a state of semi-suspension. Some government cadres even say: "As long as the central tasks are done well, it doesn't matter if the school collapses." Primary school teachers in the Fifteenth District of Kaiping, Guangdong, wrote to reflect that the local People's Government transferred primary school teachers to participate in central tasks; some primary school teachers had objections, and the district leaders said they "did not obey the organization" and were "divorced from politics." During this year's autumn grain requisition work, the district People's Government transferred all primary school teachers from all schools in the district, leaving only one person in each school. As a result, all primary schools in the district were suspended for more than ten days. Qin Fu, a reader from the Third District of Qianshan County, Jiangxi, wrote that the district People's Government transferred all the teachers from the nine primary schools in the four townships of Gangdong, Nangeng, Xiaji, and Shihhan during the autumn grain requisition work, causing these nine primary schools to be suspended for two weeks from October 23. This situation is even serious in some large cities. For example, in order to build school buildings for various primary schools in Xidan District, Beijing, a primary school principal was transferred to purchase wood and other materials. After taking on this job, the principal would teach one class every morning and then go to the suburbs to purchase and transport wood, returning to school after 7 p.m. This not only seriously affected his teaching and school administrative work, but also affected his health.

    The above-mentioned situations have seriously affected the normal conduct of teaching in some primary schools and greatly hindered the improvement of primary school teachers' political and professional levels. According to the current situation, the number of primary school teachers nationwide is indeed insufficient to meet objective needs, and there is an urgent need to improve their quality. In particular, the implementation of the five-year consistent system will be promoted step by step nationwide in the future, and improving the level of primary school teachers is a more urgent and important issue. According to a rough estimate, if more than 40% of primary school teachers nationwide do not effectively improve their cultural and professional levels, it will be difficult for them to be competent in the teaching tasks of the five-year consistent system. Therefore, the above-mentioned situation not only has a bad impact on the current primary school education, but also is very unfavorable to the development and improvement of primary school education in the future. This issue should be given attention by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Party and government leading organs in various places, and it should be resolved quickly.

    In order to solve this problem, we believe that we should start from the following two aspects.

    First, the Party and government leading organs in various places should educate cadres below the county and district levels to correctly understand the importance of primary school education. As reflected in the readers' letters, many cadres have mistakenly understood the significance of education serving politics, and even completely negated the importance of education, believing that "it doesn't matter if the school collapses as long as the central tasks are done well." This view is undoubtedly very harmful. They should be told that the education cause of New China has a huge role in improving the people's political awareness and cultural level, and cultivating talents for national construction; and primary school education is the foundation of the education cause of New China. To make the work of primary school teachers serve politics, the main thing is to improve their political level and combine patriotic ideological education in teaching. Of course, it is also appropriate for primary school teachers to participate in appropriate social work under the condition that it does not hinder teaching work and political and professional studies. However, it is very harmful to the country and the people to let primary school teachers bear excessive extra work, or even arbitrarily transfer primary school teachers to engage in central tasks, so that it hinders primary school teachers' teaching and learning. Only when they understand this can they consciously correct this erroneous practice.

    Secondly, we suggest that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government notify the education administrative departments of governments at all levels, and jointly study with the local Party and government leading organs, and appropriately restrict the scope of primary school teachers' participation in social work according to the specific situation, so as to ensure that primary school teachers are not arbitrarily transferred or burdened with excessive extra work.

### 纠正让小学教师负担社会工作过多的错误做法

    纠正让小学教师负担社会工作过多的错误做法
    各地很多小学教师来信反映：目前不少地区小学教师担任的社会工作过多，以致严重地妨碍了他们的教学工作和业务学习。他们迫切要求中央人民政府教育部和各地党政领导机关采取有效办法解决这个问题。
    很多地方的党政领导机关任意给小学教师分配额外工作，使小学教师不胜负担。如原察哈尔省蔚县六区人民政府的武装部、生产办公室等部门，经常把总结材料、汇报、表册等送给区人民政府所在地吉家庄完全小学教师去抄写，而且数量很多。如七月份的一天晚上，有的教师已经睡觉了，区人民政府却送去了一些生产材料统计表，让教师连夜抄写。结果，五、六个教师一直抄到深夜两点才完。第二天早上学生来上学了，老师都起不来。该县八区青年团区委委员屈恒，随便召集教师听他讲话，召集校长开会，随便要学校为他做各种表册、报告。他曾要桃花完全小学的教师孙永瑞替他总结材料，使孙永瑞和四个学生费了一天和两个晚上的时间。更严重的是，不少地区在中心工作来时，竟不惜让小学停课，任意抽调小学教员去工作。河南邓县读者惠正等来信说：该县领导机关在中心工作来时，就随便抽调小学教员去工作，并且常常一调就是半年。这样，很多小学就陷于半停课状态。而有些政府干部还说：“只要中心工作做好，学校垮了也不要紧。”广东开平十五区小学教师来信反映：当地人民政府抽调小学教师去参加中心工作；有的小学教师有意见，区里的领导干部就说他们“不服从组织”，“脱离政治”。在今年秋征工作中，区人民政府将全区各校小学教师都抽调来了，每校只留下一人。这样，全区所有小学都停课十多天。江西铅山县第三区读者秦孚来信说：该区人民政府在秋征工作时，把所属港东、南耕、下际、石涵四个乡的九个小学的教师都抽走了，使这九个小学从十月二十三日起就停了二个星期课。这种情况甚至在某些大城市里也很严重。如北京西单区为了修建各小学校舍，将一个小学校长调去担任购买木料等工作。这个校长担任了这个工作，每天早晨上了一节课后，就到郊区去购运木料，到下午七点多才能回校。这不但严重影响了他的教学和学校行政工作，并且还影响了他的健康。
    上述情况已经严重影响了某些小学校教学的正常进行，大大妨碍了小学教师政治水平和业务水平的提高。根据目前情况，全国小学教师的数量固然不足以应客观需要，而在质量上也是亟需提高的。尤其今后全国将有步骤地推行五年一贯制，提高小学师资水平是更加迫切重要的问题。据大略的估计，目前全国百分之四十以上的小学教师，如果不有效地提高他们的文化业务水平，就难以胜任五年一贯制的教学任务。因此，上述情况不但对目前小学教育有不好的影响，而且对今后小学教育的发展和提高也是很不利的。这个问题应该引起中央人民政府教育部和各地党政领导机关的重视，并迅速加以解决。
    为了解决这个问题，我们认为应该从下列两方面着手。
    首先，各地党政领导机关应该教育县区以下的干部正确地认识小学教育事业的重要性。像读者来信所反映的，不少干部错误地理解了教育为政治服务的意义，甚至根本否定了教育的重要性，认为“中心工作做好，学校垮了也不要紧。”这种看法无疑是十分有害的。应该告诉他们：新中国的教育事业对提高人民的政治觉悟和文化水平，培养国家建设人材有巨大的作用；而小学教育正是新中国教育事业的基础。要使小学教师的工作为政治服务，主要的就是要使他们提高政治水平，在教学中结合爱国主义的思想教育。当然小学教师在不妨碍教学工作和政治、业务学习的条件下，参加适当的社会工作也是应当的。但是，让小学教师担负过多的额外工作，甚至任意抽调小学教师搞中心工作，以致妨碍了小学教师的教学和学习，对国家、人民都是十分有害的。只有让他们了解这一点，他们才能自觉地纠正这种错误做法。
    其次，我们建议中央人民政府教育部通知各级人民政府的教育行政部门，和当地党政领导机关共同研究，根据具体情况对小学教师参加社会工作的范围作适当限制，以保障小学教师不被任意抽调或负担过多的额外工作。
