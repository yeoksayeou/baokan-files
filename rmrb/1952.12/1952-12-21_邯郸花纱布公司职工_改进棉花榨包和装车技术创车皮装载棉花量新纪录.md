Following the creation of a new record of 22 tons of cotton loaded per 30-ton railcar by employees of the Shanzhou Office of the Henan Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn Company, employees of the Handan Cotton Yarn Company have further improved cotton baling and loading techniques, increasing the cotton load per 30-ton railcar to 24.31 tons, setting a new national record.

In the past, the Handan Cotton Yarn Company had inconsistent baling machine structures, resulting in inconsistent cotton bale specifications and excessively large volumes, with typical volumes reaching 0.53742 cubic meters and weights reaching 200 jin, greatly limiting the increase in cotton loading capacity. Each railcar could only load 127 bales, weighing 12.7 tons, resulting in significant waste of transportation costs. Comrade Cheng Jingwen of the Wu'an Branch of the company repeatedly studied and modified the baling machine, increasing the baling force and standardizing the cotton bale specifications to 0.39116 cubic meters, weighing 235 jin, a 27 percent reduction in volume compared to the original. Comrade Wang Fenglin of the company and loading workers, with the assistance of the Railway Bureau, also developed new loading methods based on the ×-type 30-ton standard railcar, enabling each railcar to load seven layers, a total of 189 bales, increasing the weight to 22.205 tons, and shortening the loading time by 58 percent.

Based on the above achievements, the Handan Cotton Yarn Company and the Railway Bureau further researched and improved the cotton baling process by reducing the amount of cotton packed per bale, packing frequently, and treading diligently to increase the baling force and reduce the volume, increasing the average weight per bale to 250 jin. Significant improvements were also made to the loading techniques, enabling each railcar to load seven layers with a total of 192 bales, weighing 24.31 tons.

According to Handan's annual transportation task, this creation and improvement can reduce the number of bales packed by 40,000 and save 2631 railcars, saving a total of 150,000 yuan in various expenses per ton, a total savings of 10.5 billion yuan. Based on the province's annual transportation task, a total of 35.55 billion yuan can be saved.

    邯郸花纱布公司职工
    改进棉花榨包和装车技术创车皮装载棉花量新纪录
    继中国花纱布公司河南省公司陕州办事处职工创造每三十吨车皮装载二十二吨棉花的新纪录之后，邯郸花纱布公司职工又改进棉花榨包和装车技术，使每三十吨车皮的棉花装载量提高到二四·三一吨，创全国最高纪录。
    邯郸花纱布公司过去因榨包机构造不一，因而棉包规格也不一致，且体积过大，一般的体积达○·五三七四二立方公尺，重达二○○斤，大大限制了棉花装载量的提高，每车皮只能装一二七包，重一二·七吨，使运输费用浪费很大。该公司所属武安支公司程景文同志反复研究，改造了榨包机，增大了榨力，使棉包规格统一为○·三九一一六立方公尺，重二三五斤，较原体积缩小百分之二十七。该公司王凤林同志和装卸工人，在铁路局的协助下，又根据×—型三○吨标准车皮，研究出新的装载办法，使每车可装七层，共计一八九包，重量提高到二二·二○五吨，装车时间也缩短百分之五八。
    邯郸花纱布公司与铁路局，在上述成就的基础上，又进一步研究改进，在棉花榨包时少装、勤装、勤踩，以加大榨力，缩小体积，使每包平均重量增加到二五○斤。装载技术也有很大改进，使每车七层共装一九二包，重量达二四·三一吨。
    这一创造和改进，按邯郸全年运输任务计算，较前可少打四万个包，节省车皮二六三一个，总计每吨可节省各种费用开支十五万元，共节省一○五亿元。按全省全年运输任务计算，总共可节省三百五十五亿五千万元。
