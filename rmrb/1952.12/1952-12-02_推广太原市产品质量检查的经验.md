    Promote the Experience of Product Quality Inspection in Taiyuan City

    The quality of industrial products is a major issue related to national defense and economic construction. Therefore, improving product quality is one of the important tasks in the current production increase and economy drive, and it has extremely important significance for the large-scale national economic construction that is about to begin next year. The experience of Taiyuan City in systematically solving the problem of industrial product quality in a concentrated manner during the autumn production increase and economy competition is worth learning from by factories and mines in various regions.

    The main experience of Taiyuan City in solving quality problems is to start by solving ideological problems. Its main methods are: leaders taking the lead and conducting self-criticism at all levels; grasping typical cases to promote the general; holding quality exhibitions; and soliciting users' opinions. Through these methods, it exposed the one-sided production views of leading cadres that emphasized quantity over quality and disregarded costs, capitalist management views, and complacency; it exposed the conservative thinking, localism, and championship-seeking mentality of the workers; it also exposed shortcomings in production management and technical management. The exposure of these thoughts and the revelation of these errors shocked people, making them realize the serious economic and political significance of improving product quality, thereby establishing a quality concept and a comprehensive production view.

    Secondly, Taiyuan City correctly adopted the method of combining mobilizing the masses to find tricks and promoting advanced experience of decisive significance to carry out technical promotion activities to solve quality problems. Experience proves that after workers have established a quality concept, as long as the leading cadres of factories and mines are good at leading the masses to find tricks, good at mobilizing technicians to combine with workers, and solve key problems, significant achievements will be made in technical improvement, and product quality will truly and rapidly improve. The experience of Taiyuan City also proves that after factories and mines have solved quality problems, they must revise and implement technical operating procedures and formulate quality responsibility systems to consolidate the results of quality inspection and ensure the steady improvement of product quality. This is a necessary step to systematically solve quality problems and consolidate quality. This is also worth paying attention to by factories and mines.

    At present, the one-sided production view of emphasizing quantity over quality still exists among leading cadres in many factories and mines. In addition to the fact that many comrades have a purely quantitative task view, some comrades become complacent when product quality has improved slightly; or when products sell well, they develop thoughts of shoddy workmanship and blindly pursuing profits; some comrades emphasize objective difficulties such as technology and equipment, and some even think that: "The factory director only cares about output, and quality is the business of the chief engineer." Therefore, party committees of industrial and mining enterprises in various regions must take all measures to correct these erroneous ideas of leading cadres, so that they can realize the importance of product quality, and then influence and educate the broad masses of workers to pay attention to the improvement of product quality. Only when all employees pay attention to the improvement of product quality can advanced experience be better promoted and the production increase and economy drive be carried out more deeply.

    推广太原市产品质量检查的经验
    工业产品质量的优劣是关系着国防建设和经济建设的重大问题，因而提高产品质量是目前增产节约运动中的重要任务之一，它对明年即将开始的全国大规模的经济建设有极其重要的意义。太原市在秋季增产节约竞赛运动中集中地系统地解决工业产品质量问题的经验，是值得各地厂矿学习的。
    太原市解决质量问题的主要经验，是从解决思想问题入手。它的主要方法是领导带头，层层检讨；抓住典型，推动一般；举办质量展览会；征求用户意见等。通过这些办法，暴露了领导干部的轻质重量、不计成本的片面生产观点，资本主义经营观点和自满情绪；暴露了工人群众的保守思想、本位主义和锦标主义；同时也暴露了生产管理和技术管理上的缺点。这些思想的暴露和错误的揭发，使人们大吃一惊，认识到提高产品质量的严重的经济意义和政治意义，从而树立了质量观念，树立了全面的生产观点。
    其次，太原市正确地采取了发动群众找窍门和推广有决定意义的先进经验相结合的技术推广运动的方法来解决质量问题。经验证明：职工群众树立了质量观念之后，只要厂矿领导干部善于领导群众找窍门，善于发动技术人员与工人相结合，解决关键性的问题，技术改进就会获得显著成就，产品质量也就能真正地迅速地得到提高。太原市的经验也证明：各厂矿解决了质量问题以后，必须修订和贯彻技术操作规程，制订质量责任制，以巩固质量检查的成果，保证产品质量稳步上升。这是有系统地解决质量问题，巩固质量必须采取的步骤。这也是值得各厂矿重视的。
    目前，轻质重量的片面生产观点还在许多厂矿领导干部中存在着。除了不少同志存在着单纯数量任务观点外，有些同志在产品质量得到些小改进时就自满起来；或在产品畅销时即滋生粗制滥造、盲目追求利润的思想；有的同志则强调技术、设备等客观困难，甚至还有人认为：“厂长只管产量，至于质量那是主任工程师的事。”所以，各地工矿党委必须采取一切办法来纠正这些领导干部的错误思想，使他们认识到产品质量的重要性后，才能通过他们去影响和教育广大职工群众重视产品质量的改进，也只有在全体职工重视了产品质量的改进后，才能够更好地推广先进经验，更深入地开展增产节约运动。
