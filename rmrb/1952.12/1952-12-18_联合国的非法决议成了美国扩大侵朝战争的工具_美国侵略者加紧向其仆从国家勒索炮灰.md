    Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The illegal United Nations resolution, which echoes the U.S. government's unreasonable stance on the prisoner of war issue, has become a tool for the U.S. aggressors to continue and expand the Korean War.
    After the United Nations General Assembly passed its illegal resolution on the Korean issue on December 3, based on the Indian proposal, the United Press International reported: "This resolution firmly agrees to the principle of non-forcible repatriation, thus marking a major victory for the United States and its allies in Korea." U.S. representative Gross immediately assured that the United States, "as the government responsible to the Korean Unified Command, will do everything possible to faithfully and fully implement the provisions of this resolution."
    It is no accident that the U.S. government, while refusing to implement the provisions of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the principle of prisoner repatriation, which it had already agreed to, is showing such enthusiasm for the illegal United Nations resolution. This is because this resolution, which is clearly unacceptable to the Korean and Chinese side, not only absolves the United States of responsibility for sabotaging the armistice talks, but also paves the way for the U.S. war policy.
    After the Indian proposal became an illegal United Nations resolution, the Wall Street mouthpiece, "The New York Times," immediately used it to pressure countries following the United States to further sell their lives for the United States. "The New York Times" said, "If the war is to continue, then unity in principle alone is not enough, although this is welcome and important. Unity in principle should be followed by unity in action, especially when fighting is needed to realize this principle..."
    United Press International revealed how the U.S. government demands that its vassal states unite in action. United Press International reported that "official sources" in the United Nations said that if the Korean and Chinese side rejected the Indian proposal, the United Nations General Assembly "will be asked to proceed with the next stage of the plan originally proposed by the United States, namely the 'tough' stage, in which the member states of the United Nations should offer more contributions to the Korean War." At the same time, according to the Associated Press report on November 28, the U.S. delegation in the United Nations had indicated to all other countries that if the Indian proposal was rejected as expected, Eisenhower "should come up with a way for the next step."
    On the very day that the illegal United Nations resolution was passed, Eisenhower began his activities in Korea. In his talks after his visit to Korea, Eisenhower made no mention of the armistice negotiations. He admitted that he "did not have any panaceas and tricks to solve any problems," and his only way was to continue the war: "make many efforts to improve our situation"; to draft a war plan that could not but "risk the serious danger of expanding the war"; "continue to devote ourselves to the common goals that we have revealed so far and will continue to pursue."
    In this way, Eisenhower prepared the conditions for himself to use the illegal United Nations resolution to continue and expand the war after he came to power in the future. United Press International reported from Washington that Eisenhower's talks "paved the way" for his coming to power, making the vassal states "understand that there is probably no quick way to end the war in the near future." United Press International also reported that diplomats in Washington predicted: "Eisenhower will not reopen the armistice negotiations unless they are based on the conditions of the United Nations."
    The U.S. war policy has been determined by the passage of the Indian proposal. The U.S. machine for prolonging and expanding the Korean War has thus been accelerated. Various war plans have been put forward by Clark, Van Fleet, MacArthur, Syngman Rhee, and the U.S. Department of Defense; Eisenhower has discussed these plans with his strategists in the Pacific. The work of collecting more cannon fodder is also being intensified. In addition to stepping up the training of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, Richard B. Russell, chairman of the U.S. Senate Military Committee, has specifically named Canada, France, Australia, and New Zealand for extortion, demanding that these
    "Comrades-in-arms in Korea provide more combat troops." In this way, the U.S. government is "faithfully and completely" following the path opened up to it by the illegal United Nations resolution, moving towards a larger-scale war of aggression.

### 联合国的非法决议成了美国扩大侵朝战争的工具  美国侵略者加紧向其仆从国家勒索炮灰

    联合国的非法决议成了美国扩大侵朝战争的工具
    美国侵略者加紧向其仆从国家勒索炮灰
    【新华社十六日讯】附和美国政府在战俘问题上的无理主张的联合国非法决议案已成为美国侵略者继续和扩大朝鲜战争的工具。
    在联合国大会以印度提案为底本于十二月三日通过了他们的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案以后，合众社就报道说：“这个决议坚决同意不得强迫遣返的原则，因此标志着美国及其在朝鲜的盟国的重大胜利。”美国代表葛罗斯立刻保证：美国“作为对朝鲜统一司令部负责的政府，将尽一切力量忠实地并完全地执行这个决议案的规定”。
    美国政府拒绝执行它自己已经同意了的朝鲜停战协定草案中关于遣俘原则的规定，却对联合国非法决议案表示如此热心，这不是偶然的。这是因为这个显然不能为朝中方面接受的决议案，不但替美国开脱了破坏停战谈判的责任，并且替美国的战争政策铺平了道路。
    在印度提案变成了联合国非法决议案以后，华尔街的喉舌“纽约时报”立即利用它来压迫跟随美国的国家进一步为美国卖命。“纽约时报”说，“假如战争要继续打下去，那么只是在原则上团结一致，还是不够的，虽然这一点很值得欢迎，而且很重要。在原则上的团结一致以后，应当继之以行动上的团结一致，特别是在为了实现这一原则而需要战斗的时候……。”
    合众社透露了美国政府要求它的仆从国家怎样在行动上团结一致。合众社报道说，联合国中的“官方人士”说，如果印度提案遭到朝中方面的拒绝，联合国大会“将被要求进行美国起初提出的计划中的次一阶段，即‘强硬’阶段，在这个阶段中，联合国各会员国应对朝鲜战争提出更多的贡献”。同时，据美联社在十一月二十八日报道，联合国中的美国代表团已经向所有其他国家表示，假如印度提案如所预料地遭到拒绝的话，艾森豪威尔就“应想出下一步骤的办法”。
    就在联合国非法决议案通过的那一天，艾森豪威尔开始了他在朝鲜的活动。在他访问朝鲜以后发表的谈话中，艾森豪威尔绝口不提停战谈判。他承认他“没有能够解决任何问题的万灵药和诀窍”，他的唯一办法就是继续战争：“作许多努力来改善我们的情况”；拟订一个不能不“冒扩大战争的严重危险”的战争计划；“继续致力于迄今为止我们所揭示并将继续追求的共同目标”。
    艾森豪威尔就这样替自己在将来上台以后利用联合国非法决议案继续和扩大战争准备了条件。合众社从华盛顿报道说，艾森豪威尔的谈话给他的上台“铺平了道路”，使仆从国家“都明白眼前大概没有什么迅速结束战争的办法”。合众社还报道说，华盛顿的外交官们预料：“艾森豪威尔不会重开停战谈判，除非以联合国的条件为基础。”
    美国的战争政策已经因为印度提案的通过而确定下来了。美国的延长并扩大朝鲜战争机器就这样加速开动起来了。各种各样的战争计划，已经由克拉克、范佛里特、麦克阿瑟、李承晚、美国国防部提了出来；艾森豪威尔已经和他的策士们在太平洋上讨论了这些计划。搜罗更多炮灰的工作也在加紧进行。除了加紧训练李承晚伪军而外，美国参院军事委员会主席理查德·布·鲁塞尔已经指名向加拿大、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰进行勒索，要这些
    “在朝鲜的战友提供更多的作战部队”。美国政府就是这样“忠实地并且完全地”照着联合国非法决议案给它开辟的道路，走向更大规模的侵略战争。
