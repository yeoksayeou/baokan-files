    Leading Cadres of Qidaogou Iron Mine Should Correct
    Their Erroneous Attitude Towards Capital Construction

    Editor: The leading cadres of our Qidaogou Iron Mine do not pay enough attention to capital construction projects, leaving the projects in a state of no one being responsible. In terms of technical guidance, they have no plan, only saying, "Try it, feel your way as you go." This has resulted in a great loss of state assets. For example, the ore storage nest project of our mine started construction on April 22nd and was originally scheduled to be completed in May. However, the work was suspended midway due to disagreements among the cadres during the laying of steel rails at the chute opening, and the already laid steel rails were reworked. As a result, 73 cut steel rails were wasted, equivalent to more than 180 million yuan in Renminbi. In addition, eight cylinders of oxygen and 75 kilograms of calcium carbide were used, and the waste of labor was added, making the total waste of this project more than 185 million yuan. At the same time, the task has not been completed. Another example is that in order to repair houses for the families of workers, 270 workers were brought in. When these workers arrived, the workers' families had not yet moved out, and they could not be repaired, so they had to wait for two days. More seriously, this repair project only required 20 people, but so many people were brought in, wasting 250 workdays. If each person's daily wage is calculated at ten points, the state wasted 5,000 points in two days. Other projects such as changing rooms and bathhouses were also reworked due to disagreements among cadres, resulting in waste.

    I think these problems are very serious, and I hope that the leading cadres of Qidaogou Iron Mine will quickly change their irresponsible attitude towards national construction.　Oral account by Li Shoufu

### 七道沟铁矿领导干部应纠正对待基本建设的错误态度

    七道沟铁矿领导干部应纠正
    对待基本建设的错误态度
    编辑同志：我们七道沟铁矿的领导干部对于基本建设工程重视不够，使工程陷于无人负责状态。在技术指导上，他们没有计划，只说：“试着干，摸索着干吧。”因而造成国家资财很大的损失。如我矿的贮矿巢工程，于四月二十二日施工，当时预计可在五月竣工，但中途因在溜子口铺钢轨时干部中间意见分歧而停工，并把已铺好的钢轨重新返工，因此，浪费了已割断的钢轨七十三根，约折合人民币
    一亿八千多万元。另外，用掉氧气八桶，电石七十五公斤，加上人工的浪费，这一工程计浪费一亿八千五百多万元。同时还没有完成任务。又如为了给工人家属修理房子，找来二百七十个工人，这些工人来了，工人家属还没有搬出去，无法修理，只好等待两天。更严重的是，这项修理工程只需要二十个人就够了，却找来了那么多人，浪费二百五十个工，每人每日工资按十分计算，两天就给国家浪费五千分。其他如更衣室、澡塘等工程，也因干部意见分歧而返工，造成浪费。
    我认为这些问题都很严重，希望七道沟铁矿领导干部迅速改变这种对待国家建设事业不负责任的态度。　李守福口述
