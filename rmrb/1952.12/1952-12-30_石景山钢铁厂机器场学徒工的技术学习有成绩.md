    Apprentice Technicians at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Machine Shop Achieve Success in Technical Studies
    Comrade Editor: In order to enable young apprentice workers to quickly master operating techniques and understand lathe knowledge, the machine shop of the repair department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has established technical training classes since last year, adopting a teaching method that combines theory and practice. The apprentices have made rapid progress. Now they have all learned a scientific and simple method of calculating gears, which makes their work very fast. After apprentice Liu Hu learned the calculation method for lathe screw gears, the master craftsman asked him to hang the gears, and he calculated it quickly and accurately. Liu Hu started working at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in 1949. Due to his low education level, his technical improvement was slow. Whenever calculations were needed, the master craftsman would explain it to him for a long time, and he would try very hard to listen, but he couldn't understand the key points. He joined the training last May and made rapid progress. In September, he was promoted to a Level 2 technician. Apprentice Han Hongli scored 95 points in the technical theory test during his upgrade exam and was quickly promoted to a Level 3 technician.
    The first group of eight apprentices who participated in the technical training class have, after half a year of study, had four promoted to Level 2 technicians, one promoted to Level 3 technician, and three promoted to Level 4 technicians (they had more than two years of seniority). Currently, more than 30 people are participating in the technical training class. In addition, the factory has added a class specifically for teaching drawing and drafting. This not only trains a large number of technicians, but also greatly shortens the process of apprentices becoming technicians.　Mo Ping

    石景山钢铁厂机器场学徒工的技术学习有成绩
    编辑同志：石景山钢铁厂修理部机器场，为使青年学徒工人迅速掌握操作技术懂得车床常识，从去年起，设立了技术学习班，采取理论与实际相结合的办法教学，学徒工们进步很快。现在都学到了一种科学的简便的算轮方法，干起活来非常迅速。学徒工刘虎学会了车螺丝挂轮的计算方法后，老师傅叫他去挂轮，他一会就算出来了，而且很准。刘虎一九四九年到石景山钢铁厂工作，他文化低，技术提高得很慢，一碰到需要计算的时候，老师傅给他讲半天，他费很大劲听，也听不清楚要点在那里。去年五月他参加了学习，进步很快，九月份他就升为二级技工了。学徒工韩宏礼在升级考试中，技术理论考试得到九十五分，很快就被提升为三级技工了。
    参加该技术学习班学习的第一批学徒工共八个人，他们经过半年学习，已有四个升为二级技工，一个升为三级技工，三个升为四级技工（他们原有工龄二年多）。目前该技术学习班已有三十多人参加学习。另外该厂还添设了一个班专门教画图和制图。这不但培养了大批技工，而且大大缩短了学徒工转为技工的过程。　莫平
