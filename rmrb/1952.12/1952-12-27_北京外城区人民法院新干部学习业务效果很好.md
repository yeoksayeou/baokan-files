    The New Cadres of the People's Court in the Outer City District of Beijing are Having Good Results from Studying Professional Skills

    Editor: Since the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and especially after the organizational adjustments of the judicial reform movement, the former Outer City District People's Court of Beijing (which was divided into the Qianmen, Chongwen, Xuanwu, and Nanyuan District People's Courts starting this December) absorbed a group of outstanding new cadres. The vast majority of these new cadres are young, full of vitality, firm in their stance, and highly enthusiastic about their work. However, they lack work experience and their policy understanding is relatively low, so they cannot quickly start their work. In response to this situation, the court leadership organized all 59 new cadres (accounting for two-thirds of the court's cadres) for a concentrated professional skills study session from November 22nd to 30th. The study method combined large lecture reports with small group discussions. The study time was every afternoon. Under the principle of not affecting work, veteran cadres could also participate in the study according to the key points of their work. The lecturers were the president of the court and the heads of the various divisions. The study content was divided into four parts based on the actual situation of the work: industrial and commercial debts (including labor-capital and public-private relationship issues), marriage, housing rentals, and criminal matters. Before the lectures, each lecturer systematically prepared an outline, which was discussed, supplemented, and revised by the court's administrative meeting and then used as the official teaching plan. After each lecture, the heads of the divisions themselves or designated individuals would guide the study groups to discuss in connection with their work. The results of the discussions were reported promptly. The questions raised in the discussions were studied by the court's administrative meeting and answered regularly. Before the start of the study session, the responsible comrade made an ideological mobilization at the court-wide cadre meeting, calling on everyone to study seriously. Because this study met the needs of the work and was what the new cadres requested, everyone attached great importance to it and studied very seriously. During the discussions, everyone was able to combine their actual work and their own thoughts and speak enthusiastically.

    This study session was very rewarding. The new cadres felt that their policy understanding had improved, and they had a preliminary "bottom line" in their work. Zhao Rongping said: "I came to work at the court after the 'Five-Anti' movement, and I was very scared. When dealing with industrial and commercial debt cases, when the parties and I argued about policies and regulations, some of them I really didn't understand. Once I was so anxious that I almost shed tears. After this study, I solved a lot of problems regarding policies and viewpoints, and also solved my ideological problems. Now I feel confident and not afraid." Zhu Hong said: "After the judicial reform, I came to the court, and every time I handled a case, my heart would beat wildly. After this study, I really put down my burden and felt relaxed and happy. Now I am much calmer when I meet the parties involved. For example, in the past when dealing with divorce cases, I was not clear about the point that marriages arranged before liberation could not be used as sufficient grounds for divorce, and this was also completely resolved this time." Li Jishan said:
    "After this study, when I go to the inquiry office again, I will be able to answer the questions I encounter." The veteran cadres who participated in the study also felt that it was very rewarding, and their work experience was systematically organized. Another gain from this study was that everyone now generally feels a great interest in professional study, and the enthusiasm for study is very high. Some comrades who used to think they were "good enough" or "could work anyway" have begun to be humble. Those who did not study hard in the past have also begun to further realize the danger of not studying and expressed that they would work hard to study. In addition, this study also established a viewpoint for everyone—that policy laws and theories are inseparable. To study professional skills and do a good job, we must constantly strive to improve our level of Marxist-Leninist theory. Everyone realizes that policy laws are the concretization of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought at a certain time, place, and condition. This has promoted theoretical study in the future.

    Although this study was short and only a beginning, the effect was really good.

    北京外城区人民法院新干部学习业务效果很好
    编辑同志：自“三反”、“五反”运动以后，特别是司法改革运动的调整组织以后，北京市前外城区人民法院（今年十二月开始分为前门、崇文、宣武、南苑四个区人民法院）吸收了一批优秀的新干部。这批新干部的绝大部分是青年，他们都生气勃勃、立场坚定、工作热情很高。但他们缺少工作经验，政策水平也比较低，所以他们不能很快地开展工作。针对这种情况，法院领导方面就从十一月二十二日起至三十日止，组织全体五十九个新干部（占全院干部三分之二），进行了一次突击性的业务学习。学习方法是听大课报告和小组讨论相结合。学习时间为每天下午。老干部在不影响工作的原则下，也可以按业务的重点分别参加学习。讲课教员由院长和各庭长担任。学习内容，根据工作的实际情况分为工商债务（包括劳资、公私关系问题）、婚姻、房屋租赁、刑事四部分。讲课前，各教员先系统地准备，拟出提纲，经过法院的院务会议讨论、补充、修正通过以后，作为正式教案。每次讲后，都由各庭长自己或指定专人辅导各学习小组联系工作进行讨论。讨论结果及时汇报。讨论中所提出的问题，经过法院的院务会议研究后，定期解答。在学习开始前，曾经由负责同志在全院干部会上作了思想动员，号召大家要认真学习。也由于这样的学习合乎工作需要，是新干部们所要求的，所以大家都很重视，学习十分认真。讨论时，大家都能结合实际工作和各自的思想，踊跃发言。
    这次学习收获很大。新干部们感到政策水平提高了，工作时，心中初步有了“底”。赵荣平说：“‘五反’后我来法院工作，心里怕得很。处理工商债务案件时，当事人和我扣起政策、条文来，有的我真不明白。有一次急得我几乎掉眼泪。经过这次学习，我解决了好多关于政策、观点方面的问题，也解决了我的思想问题。现在我感觉心里有底了，不怕了。”朱鸿说：“司法改革后我来到法院，每处理案件时，心老扑腾扑腾地跳。经过这次学习，我确实放下了包袱，轻松愉快了。现在我见着当事人时，镇静多了。就如过去处理离婚案件时，对于解放前包办的婚姻不能作为离婚的充足理由这一点，我就不明确，这一次也彻底解决了。”李吉善说：
    “经过这次学习后，再到问事处去，遇见问题就能答复上来了。”参加学习的老干部也认为很有收获，他们的工作经验得到了一次比较有系统的整理。这次学习的另一点收获是：现在大家已经普遍对业务学习感到很大的兴趣，学习情绪很高涨。过去有些自以为“差不多了”、“反正已能工作了”的同志，开始虚心起来。过去学习不太努力的，也开始进一步体会到不学习的危险，而表示要努力学习了。另外，这次学习还给大家树立了一个观点——政策法令与理论是分不开的。要钻研业务、搞好工作，必须不断地努力提高自己的马克思列宁主义理论水平。大家都认识到，政策法令就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在一定时间、地点、条件下的具体化。这对今后的理论学习，起了推动作用。
    这次学习，虽然时间很短，而且只是一个开始，但效果确实好。
