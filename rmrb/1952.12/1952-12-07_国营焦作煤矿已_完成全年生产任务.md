    Carrying out extensive, in-depth, and sustained patriotic production increase and conservation campaigns, and vigorously promoting advanced experiences, are the keys to Jiaozuo Coal Mine's early completion of its annual production plan. This year, the mine has held eight representative meetings of advanced production workers, promoting more than 20 kinds of advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and other coal mines, and also promoted five kinds of advanced experiences created by the mine itself. Based solely on statistics of the promotion of 20 kinds of experiences, the mine has increased production worth 3.5 billion yuan for the state.

    国营焦作煤矿
    已完成全年生产任务
    国营焦作煤矿以十个月零二十天的时间超额完成了国家所给予的全年生产任务。截至十一月二十日止，焦作煤矿煤产量已超过国家任务百分之五点九九，生产效率较国家规定标准提高了百分之二十一，成本比国家规定标准降低了百分之十三点一九，煤的质量完全符合国家所定的标准。现在，各矿井正继续提高生产效率，在完成生产任务的基础上继续完成增产节约计划。
    开展广泛、深入而持久的爱国增产节约运动，和大力推广先进经验，是焦作煤矿提前完成全年生产计划的关键。今年该矿曾前后开过八次先进生产工作者代表会议，推广了苏联的和其他煤矿的先进经验二十多种，还推广了本矿创造的先进经验五种。只就二十种经验推广效果的统计，该矿就为国家增产了三十五亿元。同时该矿坚决贯彻实行了“安全卫生第一”的方针，消灭了死亡事故，减少了工伤事故，这对生产起了很大的推动作用。（新华社）
