The steel capital of the Chinese people—Anshan—has victoriously concluded its period of production recovery and is embarking on large-scale construction.

When the Northeast was first liberated, the Japanese invaders were driven out of Anshan. They completely disbelieved that the Chinese people had the strength to restore production, pointing to the iron smelting furnaces and saying to the Chinese workers, "We'll see you produce sorghum." Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied Anshan for a year and a half, producing no iron and only restoring steel production to one percent of the previous highest annual output. When they fled Anshan, the steel plant suffered severe damage, with a large number of machines and valuable instruments stolen. After Anshan returned to the people, the factories were revived in just eight months, the machines began to turn, and molten steel and iron began to flow from the furnaces. In the first year (1949), steel and iron production recovered to one-tenth of the previous highest annual output. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the help of Soviet experts, and after three years of tireless work by the Anshan working class, this year's iron production will be 62.7 percent of the previous highest annual output, and steel production will be 91.6 percent, while the iron smelting equipment currently used is only one-third of what it used to be, and steelmaking equipment is less than half of what it used to be. At the same time, thanks to the high level of enthusiasm and creativity of the Anshan working class, a number of major technical problems have also been solved. For example, the successful smelting of low-silicon iron and self-fluxing sintered ore, the successful large-scale use of sintered ore, and the creation and promotion of advanced experiences such as rapid smelting and rapid steel rolling.

On the basis of production development, the Anshan working class has also greatly improved its own lives. Wages have increased by an average of 84.7 percent compared to 1949 (as of the end of September). The state has built and repaired more than 500,000 square meters of housing for workers. In the past, employees mostly ate coarse grains and wore coarse cloth; now they mostly eat fine grains and wear fine cloth. In the first half of last year, department stores in Anshan sold more than 6,000 bolts of coarse cloth; in the same period this year, sales of coarse cloth decreased to 71 bolts, while sales of fine cloth and general merchandise increased several times. Many workers have realized their long-cherished wish of commuting by bicycle, with workers buying more than 14,000 bicycles from January to the end of October this year.

(II)

After more than three years of effort, the Anshan working class has victoriously completed the task of the recovery period and started large-scale construction work, preparing to raise steel production to a new level of technical expertise.

The restoration and renovation of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works is of utmost importance to our country. Stalin, in his summary at the end of the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan, once pointed out: "China, because it does not have its own heavy industry and its own military industry, is being trampled upon by all those who act arbitrarily." At the same time, in summarizing the Soviet experience, he pointed out: "Only heavy industry can transform and revitalize all industry, transportation, and agriculture." Soviet industrialization "started with heavy industry." The Soviet Union regarded heavy industry as "the basic link" or "foundation" of the Five-Year Plan, and especially regarded ferrous metallurgy as "the foundation of national industrialization." This is the Russian path, and Chairman Mao has instructed us that we must "take the Russian path." Therefore, the construction of Anshan, the steel capital of the Chinese people, is not only for the development of Anshan's own production, but also to lay the foundation for national industrialization and to prepare conditions for the development of all industries, transportation, and agriculture. In July 1951, the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department's "Instructions on Strengthening the Basic Construction Work of Anshan Iron and Steel" also pointed out: "The effectiveness of Anshan's basic construction work, in a certain sense, considerably affects the speed of industrial construction in the Northeast." This will naturally also considerably affect the speed of national industrial construction. Therefore, the significance of the basic construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company is extremely significant, and the responsibility borne by the Party and the working class of Anshan is very glorious.

The task given to the Anshan working class by the motherland is: within a few years, to transform the old factories and mines with new and modern technology, and at the same time to build a series of automated or semi-automated smelting plants, rolling mills, and highly mechanized mines, to increase production to three and a half to four and a half times the current level, and to greatly increase the variety of products. These products will greatly promote the development of our national economy and provide light industry, heavy industry, transportation, and basic construction with the necessary materials.

(III)

The basic construction of Anshan is being carried out with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union. The construction of the new Anshan plant has adopted the latest Soviet designs and the world's first-class equipment. According to the designs made for us by the Soviet Union, the blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel in the future will be automated blast furnaces with huge volumes, and all steelmaking furnaces will be giant, automated-controlled, high-yield open-hearth furnaces. Other facilities such as rolling mills and seamless steel pipe factories will also be automated or semi-automated factories with strong production capacity. At the same time, auxiliary departments such as power and transportation will also be renovated. When the new plant is fully completed, production capacity will increase by four and a half to five times compared to the present.

To carry out the large-scale basic construction of Anshan, it is necessary to obtain the support of the people of the whole country. As everyone knows, heavy industry requires huge amounts of capital and a considerable number of skilled technical personnel. If it is not possible to obtain the support of national manpower and material resources, the construction of heavy industry is simply impossible. In order to build Anshan, the state has spent a lot of money. This year's investment accounts for a large proportion of the entire basic construction investment in the Northeast, and even more investment will be used next year. This requires the people of the whole country to increase production and practice economy, accumulate capital, and requires the people of the whole country to "openly and consciously undertake this sacrifice," as Comrade Stalin said. Only under such conditions can our heavy industry, the foundation of our country's industrialization—ferrous metallurgy—be rapidly built successfully.

To carry out such large-scale basic construction as Anshan Iron and Steel is currently undertaking and will undertake in the future, it is also impossible without a strong organization and "a considerable number of skilled technical personnel." Thanks to the correct, timely, and specific leadership of the Party and the government, the focus of Anshan's work shifted to basic construction this spring. We have successively transferred more than 300 administrative cadres, more than 200 technical personnel, and a large number of technical workers and cadres engaged in Party and mass work from production units (currently, the number of veteran cadres and technical personnel in the basic construction department is more than twice that of the production department) to strengthen the force of basic construction.

It is not enough to simply accumulate capital and transfer skilled technical personnel for basic construction. It is also necessary to mobilize the strength of all parties to vigorously and regularly support the work of basic construction. Anshan's construction requires a large amount of labor and transportation capacity, and also requires a large amount of building materials produced by other provinces and cities, including tens of thousands of cubic meters of wood, hundreds of millions of bricks and tiles, tens of thousands of cubic meters of sand and stone, tens of thousands of tons of steel, hundreds of kilometers of cables, and hundreds of thousands of tons of processed products and equipment, and the materials required include thousands of varieties and tens of thousands of specifications. The task in this regard is very urgent, and there are many things that China has never manufactured before. Without the strong support and assistance of all parties, these difficulties cannot be solved.

First of all, in order to mobilize Anshan's own strength, we have put forward the slogans "Basic Construction First" and "Engineering First." As long as it is needed for basic construction and engineering, we would rather affect our own work and actively provide help. In the city, we put forward the slogans "Serving Anshan Iron and Steel" and "Serving Production and Construction" so that municipal construction and material supply can keep up with the needs of Anshan's development. At the same time, all parts of the country, all cities, and all brother factories and mines and enterprises have given us great assistance. They have sent a large number of cadres, technical personnel, and workers, sent a large number of cars and other transportation tools, supplied a large amount of materials and equipment, actively processed orders for Anshan, and even modified their own factories to trial-produce new products for Anshan. In short, as long as Anshan needs it, everyone is willing to actively help. This assistance has undoubtedly prepared good conditions for Anshan workers to overcome difficulties and quickly complete engineering tasks.

(IV)

The new construction project in Anshan is extremely complex and huge. No one involved in the work has experience in building such a large project, so they have encountered countless difficulties in their work. Some difficulties are like stones on the road ahead, which are moved away through the efforts of the comrades; some difficulties, although they seem like mountains blocking the way, are gradually overcome one by one thanks to the correct and specific leadership of the higher authorities, the help of Soviet experts, and everyone's efforts. As of the end of October, 50.82 percent to 56.22 percent of Anshan's major projects have been completed, and it is reliable to complete this year's construction tasks. At the same time, because the slogan "A Century-Long Plan, Quality First" has been implemented, the quality of the project has basically reached the standard.

Our main difficulties are: lack of experience, lack of technical personnel, technical workers, and cadres, and untimely supply of materials and equipment. Many of these difficulties are caused by the fact that surveying and design cannot keep up with construction needs, poor planning and preparation, and other shortcomings in work. Therefore, we must continue to concentrate our efforts to gather strength, seize the winter training and summary work to improve the level of existing personnel, strengthen the preparation work for next year's basic construction, and enrich the strength of geological, surveying, and design departments to meet the greater construction tasks next year.

The facts of Anshan's construction over the past year prove that although building heavy industry is very complex and difficult, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, coupled with the help of the Soviet Union, can not only overcome all the difficulties in basic construction, but also build large-scale modern industries with a high level of technology with good quality, fast speed, and relatively economical means. The facts of the past year have encouraged all employees of Anshan, and they have unlimited confidence in completing the task of building a new Anshan. However, things are only just beginning, there are many problems in the work, and next year's tasks will be even greater. In a situation where we know too little and our experience is far from what the work requires, we urgently need to learn and need to work very hard to learn. The facts have also proved that as long as we insist on learning, we can learn things we don't understand.

The Chinese people are about to embark on the road of large-scale economic construction. Let us raise our hands and welcome the arrival of a new industrialized China! Steadily realize national industrialization!

    鞍山工人阶级的光荣任务
    中共鞍山市委书记  韩天石
    （一）
    中国人民的钢都——鞍山已胜利地结束了恢复生产的时期，开始进行大规模的建设了。
    东北刚解放时，日本侵略者被逐出鞍山，他们完全不相信中国人民有力量恢复生产，曾指着炼铁炉对中国工人说：“要看你们出高粱”。以后，国民党反动派在鞍山盘据了一年半之久，没有出铁，仅仅把钢的生产恢复到过去最高年产量百分之一。当他们逃出鞍山时，钢铁厂反遭到他们的严重破坏，大批机器和贵重仪器被盗走。鞍山回到人民手里以后，仅八个月的时间，工厂便复活了，机器开始转动起来，炉子里开始流出火红的钢液和铁液。第一年（一九四九年）钢、铁产量即恢复到过去最高年产量十分之一。由于中国共产党的正确领导和苏联专家的帮助，经过鞍山工人阶级三年来不疲倦的工作，今年铁的产量将为过去最高年产量百分之六十二点七，钢的产量为百分之九十一点六，而现在所用的炼铁设备仅为过去的三分之一，炼钢设备还不及过去的二分之一。同时，由于鞍山工人阶级高度的积极性和创造性，还解决了不少重大技术问题。如炼制低矽铁和自溶性烧结矿的成功，大量使用烧结矿的成功，快速冶炼、快速轧钢等先进经验的创造和推广等。
    鞍山市工人阶级在发展生产的基础上，同时也大大地改善了自己的生活。工资平均比一九四九年提高百分之八十四点七（九月底）。国家为工人建筑和补修了五十多万平方公尺的住宅。过去职工多吃粗粮，穿粗布；现在多吃细粮，穿细布。去年上半年鞍山市百货商店卖出粗布六千多匹，今年同期，卖出的粗布减到七十一匹，卖出的细布和百货却增加了数倍。很多工人实现了以自行车代步的多年的愿望，今年一月至十月底，工人买的自行车达一万四千多辆。
   （二）
    鞍山工人阶级经过了三年多的努力，胜利地完成了恢复时期的任务，开始了大规模建设工作，准备把钢铁生产提高到新的高度技术水平。
    鞍山钢铁厂的恢复与改建，对我国有着极其重要的意义。斯大林在苏联第一个五年计划底总结时曾经指出：“中国因为没有自己的重工业，没有自己的军事工业，而被一切逞性妄为的人所蹂躏着。”同时，他在总结苏联的经验时指出：“只有重工业，才能把全部工业、运输业以及农业都改造过来，振兴起来。”苏联工业化是“从重工业着手”的。苏联把重工业当成“五年计划的基本环节”或“基础”，特别把黑色冶金业当做“全国工业化的基础”。这是俄国人的道路，而毛主席指示我们一定要“走俄国人的路”。因此，中国人民的钢都——鞍山的建设不仅是为了发展鞍山本身的生产，而是为了要奠定全国工业化的基础，为发展一切工业、运输业和农业而准备条件。一九五一年七月，东北人民政府工业部“关于加强鞍钢基本建设工作的指示”中也曾指出：“鞍山基本建设工作的成效，在某种意义上，相当地影响着东北工业建设的速度”。这自然也就会相当地影响全国工业建设的速度。因此，鞍山钢铁公司基本建设的意义是异常重大的，鞍山市的党和工人阶级所负担的责任是十分光荣的。
    祖国给鞍山工人阶级的任务是：数年之内要以新的现代化的技术来改造旧的厂矿，同时建设一系列自动化或半自动化的冶炼厂、轧钢厂和高度机械化的矿场，把生产量提高到现有水平的三倍半到四倍半，并使产品品种大大增加。这些产品将大大促进我国国民经济的发展，供应轻工业、重工业、运输业和基本建设以必需的材料。
    （三）
    鞍山的基本建设是在苏联的大力援助下进行的。鞍山新厂的建设，都采用了苏联最新式的设计和世界上第一流的装备。根据苏联帮我们作的设计，将来鞍钢的高炉是具有巨大容积的自动化鼓风炉，所有的炼钢炉都是巨型的自动化控制的高产量平炉。其它如轧钢工厂、无缝钢管工厂等，也都是具有强大生产能力的自动化或半自动化的工厂。同时，动力、运输等附属部门，也将改造一新。新厂全部建成后，生产能力比现在将要提高四倍半至五倍。
    要进行规模巨大的鞍山的基本建设，必须取得全国人民的支援。大家知道，重工业需要有巨量的资金和相当数量的熟练技术人材，如果不能得到全国人力物力的支持，重工业的建设根本就不可能进行。为了建设鞍山，国家曾花了很多钱，今年的投资在东北整个基本建设投资中占很大的比重，明年用的投资还要更多。这就需要全国人民增加生产和厉行节约，积累资金，就需要全国人民像斯大林同志所说的“公开和自觉地去承担这种牺牲”。只有在这样的条件下，我们的重工业、我国工业化的基础—黑色冶金业，才能迅速地建设成功。
    要进行像目前和今后鞍钢这样大规模的基本建设，没有强有力的机构和“相当数量的熟练技术人材”也是不行的。由于党和政府正确的及时的具体的领导，鞍山市的工作中心已于今春转向基本建设。我们先后由生产单位抽调了三百多名行政干部、二百多名技术人员以及大批技术工人与党和群众工作的干部（目前基本建设部门的老干部与技术人员比生产部门多出两倍以上），以壮大基本建设的力量。
    单是为基本建设积累资金和抽调熟练技术人员还是不够的，还必须动员各方面的力量大力地经常地支援基本建设的工作。鞍山建设需要大量的劳动力和运输力，也大量需要其他省、市出产的建筑材料，包括成万立方公尺的木材，成亿的砖瓦，成万立方公尺的沙石，成万吨的钢材，成百公里的电缆以及数以十万吨计的加工品和设备，而且所需要的材料有上千的品种，上万的规格。这方面的任务是十分紧急的，并且有很多东西是中国从未制造过的，如果没有各方面的大力支持和援助，这些困难是不可能解决的。
    首先，为了动员鞍山自身的力量，我们曾提出了
    “基本建设第一”、“工程第一”的口号，只要是基本建设和工程的需要，宁肯影响自己的工作，也要积极给予帮助。在市内我们提出了“为鞍钢服务”、“为生产建设服务”的口号，使市政建设、物资供应能跟上鞍山发展的需要。同时，全国各地、各城市、各兄弟厂矿和企业也给了我们以极大援助。他们派来了大批干部、技术人员和工人，派来了大批汽车和其他运输工具，供应大量材料和设备，积极为鞍山加工订货，甚至改装自己的工厂为鞍山试制新产品。总之，只要鞍山需要，大家都乐意积极帮助。这些援助，无疑为鞍山工人克服困难迅速完成工程任务准备了良好条件。
    （四）
    鞍山新建工程是极其复杂和巨大的，所有参加工作的人都没有建设这样大的工程的经验，因而在工作中遇到了无数的困难。有的困难好像摆在前进道路上的石头，经过同志们的努力就搬掉了；有的困难虽然好像一座山似的拦住了去路，由于上级正确的具体的领导和苏联专家的帮助以及大家的努力，也逐渐地一个一个被克服了。到十月底为止，鞍山主要工程已完成百分之五十点八二到百分之五十六点二二，完成今年建设任务是靠得住了。同时，因为贯彻了“百年大计、质量第一”的口号，工程质量基本上也达到了标准。
    我们主要的困难是：无经验，缺乏技术人员、技术工人和干部以及材料、设备的供应不及时。其中许多困难是由于勘察设计跟不上施工需要，计划不周和准备工作不好，以及其他工作缺点所引起的。因此，我们目前仍要以大力来集结力量，抓紧冬训和总结工作，以提高现有人员水平，加强明年基本建设的准备工作，并充实地质、勘察和设计部门力量，迎接明年更大的建设任务。
    鞍山建设一年来的事实证明：建设重工业虽然非常复杂和困难，但中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，加上苏联的帮助，不但可以克服基本建设中的一切困难，而且可以以好的质量、快的速度和较节省地来建设高度技术水平的现代化的大工业。一年来的事实鼓舞着鞍山全体职工，他们具有无限的信心完成建设新鞍山的任务。但是，事情仅仅在开始，工作中的问题很多，明年的任务更大。在我们懂得太少，经验与工作需要相距太远的情况下，我们异常需要学习，需要十分努力学习。事实也证明：只要我们坚持学习是可以学会不懂的东西的。
    中国人民即将走上大规模经济建设的道路，让我们高举双手欢迎工业化新中国的到来！稳步实现国家工业化！
