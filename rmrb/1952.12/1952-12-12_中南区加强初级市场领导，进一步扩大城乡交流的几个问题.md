    Several Issues Regarding Strengthening Primary Market Leadership and Further Expanding Urban-Rural Exchange in the Central South Region
    Zeng Chuanliu, Minister of Trade, Central South Military and Administrative Committee
    Most of the primary markets in the Central South Region have been restored. However, many chaotic phenomena still exist in some primary markets, mainly due to inappropriate management, unreasonable commodity prices, and unclear division of labor, which affect the further activation of urban-rural exchange. On the one hand, farmers have large quantities of agricultural products that they cannot sell, and they have no money to buy things. On the other hand, state-owned trading companies have stockpiled large quantities of goods, industrial products cannot reach the countryside, and state-owned trade departments cannot purchase large quantities of agricultural products. If this situation is not quickly improved, it will not only affect agricultural production but also affect the country's industrial construction. Therefore, we must improve the situation of the primary markets from four aspects: improving management, adjusting prices, rationally dividing labor, and holding planned and universal materials exchange fairs, so as to further activate urban-rural exchange.
    I. Regarding the Management of Primary Markets
    The purpose of market management is to ban speculative commerce that disrupts the market; protect and encourage legitimate business operations that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the question now is not whether or not to manage the market, but how to manage it and who should manage it. In order to prevent illegal merchants from engaging in speculation and profiteering, the state must continue to carry out necessary market management. However, various inappropriate restrictions on private merchants should be resolutely abolished. In terms of market management methods, first, the road pass system must be abolished. In the past, during the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the road pass system played a positive role. However, under today's circumstances, the road pass system has not only lost its historical role but also hinders urban-rural commodity exchange. Therefore, it must be abolished. Second, cancel purchasing permits and licenses. In the past, when prices had not yet been fully stabilized, purchasing permits and licenses played a certain role in limiting speculation. Now that the country's financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved and prices have been completely stabilized, retaining purchasing permits and licenses will similarly hinder urban-rural exchange. Third, abolish the method of compulsory centralized trading. In some counties in Hubei Province, there are more than a dozen exchanges in small market towns, forcing all industries to concentrate their transactions at the exchange, and charging a handling fee of 1.5% to 5% for transactions exceeding 10,000 yuan. This is a behavior that violates the policy of free trade. The method of forcing all industries to concentrate their transactions at the exchange in the primary market must be strictly prohibited; for those who voluntarily trade at the exchange, the handling fee should only be limited to maintaining management expenses. Fourth, abolish commercial monopoly organizations in the primary market that specialize in one line of business.
    Regarding the question of who should manage the market, it should be clearly recognized that only the state's industrial and commercial administrative departments are the legal authorities for managing the market, and all others are illegal. Now, some state-owned trading companies also go to examine the accounts of private merchants, and some farmers' associations and militiamen also manage the market, which is not right. It is also wrong for some cooperatives to prohibit private merchants from going to the countryside to do business. In order to better manage the primary market, a primary market committee of a consultative nature can be organized under the leadership of the local party, government, and industrial and commercial administrative departments, with the participation of representatives from relevant departments, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, private merchants, and shop assistants, so as to pool ideas and activate the market.
    II. Regarding Commodity Prices in Primary Markets
    Today, it is wrong to ignore the guiding role of prices in the market. Our price policy must make private businesses profitable in order to encourage their business enthusiasm. Therefore, commodity prices must be appropriately adjusted on the premise of taking into account the interests of production, transportation, and sales.
    First, regional price differences should be reasonably expanded to correct the purely task-oriented view of some state-owned trade cadres who arbitrarily reduce price differences without the approval of higher authorities, only focusing on sales and disregarding policies, and to overcome the one-sided peasant viewpoint and high price mentality of some cadres when purchasing agricultural products. For some small local products, farmers do not demand high prices, but urgently need to sell them. If the purchase price is too high, transporters will not transport them, which harms both farmers and consumers.
    Second, the wholesale and retail price differences should be appropriately expanded to make retailers and retail peddlers profitable, which will solve the farmers' suffering of "not being able to sell or buy" and solve the contradiction of state-owned trade of "not being able to sell or buy". Therefore, an appropriate wholesale starting point should be formulated according to the size of the market, and the phenomenon of chaotic wholesale starting points or even the separation of wholesale and retail in the past should be corrected.
    Third, the bad behavior of some state-owned trade cadres who arbitrarily change list prices must be corrected. This behavior, which violates price policy, will cause merchants to be dissatisfied with the People's Government and will also hinder urban-rural exchange. These cadres should be deeply educated, given strict criticism, and those who repeatedly fail to correct their behavior should be punished.
    Fourth, it is also inappropriate for some cadres to force private merchants to implement the list prices of state-owned trade. The state's method of stabilizing market prices is neither to force private merchants to implement the list prices of state-owned trade nor to let things drift, but to implement free trade under the leadership of the price policy of state-owned trade. To achieve this goal, on the one hand, it depends on reasonable prices and mutual benefit for both public and private sectors; on the other hand, it depends on state-owned trade appropriately adjusting the supply and demand of materials to maintain price stability. However, in order to make prices more stable, the method of negotiation can still be used. On the part of private merchants, they should advocate the style of clear pricing, reducing costs, and honest operation.
    III. Regarding the Division of Labor in Primary Markets
    Among the businesses in the primary market, state-owned trade, as the leading component, operates mainly commodities and focuses on wholesale. Therefore, it is incorrect for some state-owned trade units to expand the types of commodities they operate at will and to use a lot of energy to operate retail businesses. The practice of state-owned trade institutions "setting up stalls everywhere and blooming everywhere" is also not right. Mobile groups and offices that do not play a large role in some areas should be withdrawn immediately. In the future, the establishment of institutions should implement the principle of two-level approval. The institutions of state-owned trade below the county level must implement the business policy of focusing on wholesale. State-owned trading companies in the primary market must implement the state's trade policies, especially the price policy, and lead cooperatives and private merchants to play their due role in activating the primary market. Any style of doing everything alone and not acting in accordance with policies must be corrected.
    The cooperative economy is an important part of connecting urban-rural exchange and is an important assistant for the state to purchase agricultural products and promote industrial products. At present, cooperatives should consolidate existing supply and marketing cooperatives (and steadily and appropriately develop them in areas where there are no supply and marketing cooperatives), complete the purchase tasks assigned by the state, and develop production cooperatives in a planned and steady manner to achieve the goals of organizing farmers and supporting production. Cooperatives should implement state list prices. Any blind exclusion of private merchants will make the market more chaotic and will hinder urban-rural exchange, which should be corrected immediately.
    Private business is one of the components of the new democratic commerce and plays a certain role in urban-rural exchange. In the past, some private merchants had engaged in the "five evils" in a big way. After the "Five-Anti" movement, their "five evils" were strictly examined and criticized. Now, most private merchants are engaged in legitimate business operations, but many private merchants have developed a waiting mentality of not moving their capital after eliminating the "five evils". This idea is wrong. Private merchants can only contribute to the country if they actively operate. Chairman Mao said: As long as they do things that are beneficial to the people, the people will not forget them. Private businesses have contributed some efforts during the market recovery period in the past. Now that the country has entered the construction period, private industrialists and businessmen should further play their active role in activating urban-rural and domestic and foreign exchanges and strive to serve the country's economic construction. This is also beneficial to private businesses themselves.
    In short, state-owned trade, cooperatives, and private businesses should cooperate well in the primary market to develop and prosper the urban and rural economy according to the needs of the country.
    IV. Planned and Universal Convening of Materials Exchange Fairs
    Materials exchange fairs in provinces, cities, counties, and primary markets in the Central South Region have achieved great success. According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of autumn, as of October, more than 5,000 organized large, medium, and small exchange fairs have been held, with a transaction amount of 68.46 billion yuan, which has played a significant role in supporting production and activating the urban and rural economy, and has also gained some experience. At present, materials exchange fairs in many places, especially in primary markets, are being held, and they should be continued and the exchange activities should be carried out by universally utilizing forms such as temple fairs and mule and horse fairs. This winter and next spring, we plan to hold a materials exchange fair with leadership, organization, and planning in all markets above the county level. Exchange fairs in economic zones and large and medium-sized cities can also be convened at selected times. We must resolutely do a good job in urban-rural economic exchange to meet the upcoming large-scale economic construction of the country.

    中南区加强初级市场领导，进一步扩大城乡交流的几个问题
    中南军政委员会贸易部部长  曾传六
    中南区的初级市场，大部分已经恢复。但若干初级市场还存在着许多混乱现象，主要的是管理不适当，商品价格不合理，分工不明确，以致影响城乡交流的进一步活跃。一方面，农民的大批农产品卖不出去，他们没有钱买东西；另一方面，国营贸易公司积压大批商品，工业品不能下乡，国营贸易部门也不能大量收购农产品。这种状况如不迅速加以改善，不仅影响着农业生产，也将影响国家的工业建设。因此我们必须从改善管理、调整价格、合理分工、有计划地普遍召开物资交流会等四个方面，改善初级市场的情况，以便进一步活跃城乡交流。
    一、关于初级市场的管理
    市场管理的目的是取缔扰乱市场的投机商业；保护和鼓励有利于国计民生的正当经营的商业。因此，现在的问题不是要不要管理市场，而是如何管、谁来管的问题。为了防止不法商人投机倒把，国家必须继续进行必要的市场管理。但对于私商的各种不适当的限制，应该坚决取消。在管理市场的方法上，第一、必须取消路条制。过去在进行土地改革和镇压反革命时期，路条制曾经发挥过积极的作用。但是，在今天的情况下，路条制不仅失去了它的历史作用，而且阻碍城乡商品交流了。因此，必须予以取消。第二、取消采购证照。在过去物价还没有完全稳定时，采购证照对于限制投机也曾有其一定作用。现在国家财政经济情况已根本好转，物价已完全稳定，如仍保留采购证照，同样是妨碍城乡交流的。第三、取消强制集中交易的办法。湖北省有些县的小集镇竟有十几个交易所，强迫一切行业到交易所集中交易，成交一万元以上的，都要收百分之一点五到百分之五的手续费，这是一种违反贸易自由政策的行为。必须严格取缔初级市场中强制各行业到交易所集中交易的办法；自愿到交易所成交者，其手续费也只能以维持管理费用为限。第四、取缔初级市场一行一业专行专业的商业垄断组织。
    关于谁来管理市场的问题，应该明确认识，只有国家工商行政部门是管理市场的合法机关，除此以外都是非法的。现在有些国营贸易公司也去审查私商账目，有的农会和民兵也去管理市场，这都是不对的。某些合作社不准私商下乡作买卖也是错误的。为着把初级市场管理的更好，可以试行在当地党、政府及工商行政部门领导之下，吸收有关部门、工商联、私商和职工店员代表参加，组织协商性质的初级市场委员会，以便集思广益，活跃市场。
    二、关于初级市场的商品价格
    在今天，忽视价格对市场的指导作用是不对的。我们的价格政策必须使私营商业有利可图，以鼓励其经营积极性。因此，必须在照顾产、运、销三方面利益的前提下，适当地调整商品价格。
    首先应该合理地扩大地区差价，纠正某些国营贸易干部不经上级批准即随意缩小差价，只顾推销，不顾政策的单纯任务观点，克服一部分干部在收购农产品时的片面的农民观点和高价思想。对于某些小土产品，农民不是要求高价，而是迫切要求卖出去。收购价过高，贩运者不贩，既使农民吃亏，也使消费者吃亏。
    其次，应该适当地扩大批发和零售差价，使零售商和零售小贩有利可图，这样就会解决农民“卖不出，买不到”的苦楚，解决国营贸易“卖不了，买不来”的矛盾。因此，应该根据市场大小，制定恰当的批发起点，纠正过去批发起点混乱甚至批发零售不分的现象。
    第三，某些国营贸易干部随意变更牌价的不良行为必须纠正。这种违反价格政策的行为，将造成商人对人民政府的不满，也将阻碍城乡交流。应该深入教育这些干部，给予严格的批评，屡教不改者并应给予处分。
    第四，有些干部强制私商执行国营贸易的牌价，这也是不妥当的。国家稳定市场价格的办法，既不是强迫命令私商执行国营贸易的牌价，也不是放任自流，而是在国营贸易的价格政策领导下，实行贸易自由。要达到这个目的，一方面是靠价格合理，公私有利；一方面是靠国营贸易恰当地吞吐调剂物资，保持价格稳定。但为着使价格更加稳定起见，议价的办法还是可以使用的。在私商方面，则应提倡明码实价、降低成本、老实经营的作风。
    三、关于初级市场的分工
    在初级市场的商业当中，作为领导成分的国营贸易是经营主要商品，同时又是以批发为主的。因此，有些国营贸易单位随便扩大经营商品种类，和用很大力量经营零售业务的办法，是不正确的。国营贸易机构“到处设摊，遍地开花”的作法，也是不对的。目前在某些地区作用不大的流动小组和办事处应该立即撤回。以后机构设置应贯彻两级批准原则。国营贸易在县以下的机构必须贯彻以批发为主的经营方针。国营贸易公司在初级市场必须贯彻国家贸易政策，尤其是要贯彻价格政策，领导合作社和私商为活跃初级市场发挥应有的作用。任何包办代替，不按政策办事的作风都必须纠正。
    合作经济是沟通城乡交流的一个重要组成部分，是国家收购农产品，推销工业品的重要助手。目前合作社应该巩固现有的供销社（在没有供销社的地区，还应稳步的适当的发展），完成国家给予的代购任务，并且有计划地、稳步地发展生产合作社，以达到组织农民、扶植生产的目的。合作社应执行国家牌价。任何盲目排挤私商的举动，将会使市场更加混乱，也就会妨碍城乡交流，应该立即纠正。
    私营商业为新民主主义商业的组成部分之一，在城乡交流中起着一定的作用。过去某些私商曾经大肆行施“五毒”，经过“五反”运动，它们的“五毒”受了严格的检查和批判。现在一般私商正在进行正当经营，但有不少一部分私商在消除“五毒”之后产生了按资不动的等待思想。这种想法是错误的。私商只有积极经营，才能对国家有所贡献。毛主席说：只要他们做了有益于人民的事情，人民是不会忘记他们的。私营商业在过去市场恢复时期曾尽了一些力量，现在国家转入建设时期，私营工商业者更应发挥它们在活跃城乡、内外交流中的积极作用，努力为国家经济建设服务。这对私营商业自己也是有利的。
    总之，国营贸易、合作社、私营商业在初级市场应很好的分工合作，使城乡经济按国家需要发展和繁荣起来。
    四、有计划地普遍召开物资交流会中南区各省、市、县和初级市场的物资交流会曾经获得了很大成绩。根据不完整的统计，入秋以来，至十月份，共举行了有组织的大、中、小交流会五千多次，成交金额六万八千四百六十亿元，这对扶植生产和活跃城乡经济起了不小的作用，也摸到了一些经验。目前不少地方的物资交流会，特别是初级市场的物资交流会正在举行，今后更应坚持下去，普遍地利用庙会、骡马大会等形式，把这种交流活动开展起来。今冬明春，我们准备在所有县以上市场，有领导、有组织、有计划地举行一次物资交流会，经济区和大中城市的交流会也还可选择时间召开。我们要坚决地搞好城乡经济交流，迎接国家即将开始的大规模的经济建设。
