    Meetings in Beijing
    By Polish writer Marian Bielicki

    We ascended to the terrace on the eighth floor of the "Peace Hotel." Above us, in the vast, pitch-black night sky, a full moon hung, surrounded by stars. Below us, a myriad of lights pierced the night mist on the streets of Beijing. From a nearby street came the noisy sound of bicycle bells. Young women were singing a somewhat unfamiliar, but very beautiful song, slightly out of tune...

    Five of us went onto the terrace. My new friends had come to Beijing from distant lands. Each of them, upon seeing the magnificent Beijing, had images of their own country, the images of their hometowns, flood their minds, and they couldn't help but think of them. In our ears, the applause that filled Huai Ren Tang (which means "Hall of Cherishing Humanity") still echoed, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held there.

    How warmly the representatives welcomed the speeches of the Japanese people's representatives who broke through the American puppet Yoshida's sentry lines! How long did the applause last when the Japanese representatives, on behalf of millions of Japanese workers, called for the abolition of the San Francisco Separate Treaty, which forced Japan to accept the hated American occupation and serve as a supplier of cannon fodder! The Japanese people will never accept this forced role. The Japanese representatives spoke about this on the platform of the peace conference on behalf of their people.

    The moment when Korean writer Han Sorya tightly embraced Colombian representative Diego Montaña Cuéllar was very moving. In his speech, Diego Montaña Cuéllar called for all nations to work together to stop the imperialist crimes in Korea. Cuéllar spoke on the platform of the peace conference about the tragic reality of the Colombian people. He talked about the heroic resistance of the Colombian guerrillas to the Gómez fascist regime, organized in the Hitlerian style and defended by American tanks. This Colombian painfully spoke of his own flag, which originally symbolized the love of freedom of his people, being stained by the shameful actions of the Colombian government's fascist policies.

    I personally witnessed the hands of a soldier from democratic Vietnam and the hands of a peace fighter from America clasping each other warmly. Perhaps, at the very moment when the teacher from San Francisco was tightly holding the hand of the Vietnamese combat hero Nguyen Quoc Tri, French air bandits were dropping American-supplied bombs on peaceful, quiet Vietnamese villages. Nguyen Quoc Tri understood very well that behind the French colonialists stood American generals and the masters of monopoly capital. But he also knew that those who were making the land of Vietnam burn and be stained with blood for profit were also persecuting this teacher from San Francisco because he educated American children to love peace and respect other nations.

    …The representative from Ecuador carefully observed the maps of the Soviet Union, China, and Poland, softly reciting the names of the rivers along whose banks magnificent buildings rose, the names of the deserts where apples were about to blossom and wheat was beginning to ear.

    "How beautiful this is!" he couldn't help but exclaim.

    "To achieve this," the fighting Philippine poet Manuel Cruz joined the conversation, "first we need peace and independence..."

    Manuel Cruz spoke of the arduous and heroic struggle of his people, about how the soldiers of the Philippine People's Liberation Army lived in the mountains and forests, fighting against the enemies of peace and national independence. The people were not intimidated by prisons, terror, and mass shootings.

    The Beijing Peace Conference became a mirror reflecting the firm unity and friendship of the people of Asian and Pacific countries in the struggle for national independence and world peace. Now, as I talk with my new friends, I am even more convinced of this.

    The Ecuadorian was the first to speak.

    "Every night," he said thoughtfully, "after the meetings, I stroll through the streets, I look at the faces of the residents, and listen to the cheerful sounds of Beijing life. Then, we come to this terrace and gaze at the city view, I always think: how difficult was the path the Chinese people took to embark on the road to happiness! How beautiful its destiny is now!"

    "You know, I often think the same," the Burmese man, U Hla, replied, "I also think that the happiness of the Chinese people is the happiness of us all..."

    We looked at Beijing and felt the fiery, creative life of the people of People's China, illuminated by glorious labor. Envoys from many countries, as long as they are here, in Beijing, will eventually be able to understand the truth about the lives of free people. Mexican representative Ismael Cosío Villegas said on the platform of the peace conference: "Those who deceive the people and want to start a war never mention the Volga-Don Canal and the Soviet automatic excavators, nor do they mention the medical achievements of Poland and Czechoslovakia."

    A Canadian teacher joined the conversation:

    "This ocean of life that we are living is no longer the Pacific. Anger boils in the blood of millions, and the waves of popular hatred are crashing against the shores of imperialism..."

    "Did you notice how the entire venue reacted to the Soviet representative's speech?" A Mexican journalist, a fighter for peace, said: "Did you hear how many times applause interrupted his speech? Do you remember the cheers when he spoke of how the Soviet Union had only one base beyond its borders – the hearts of millions of people!"

    The topic shifted, and everyone suddenly talked about the Soviet Union, about the people building communism, about this country of human happiness, where people have learned to conquer nature and change the face of the earth. Could the news that everyone in the Soviet Union is studying and that socialist countries will implement universal ten-year compulsory education not elicit a warm response from every representative?

    I recalled meeting Louis Wheaton, a Black American fitter. I saw him among a group of Americans discussing the figures of the Soviet Union's new Stalin Five-Year Plan. As they talked about the continuously growing indicators of the living standards of the entire Soviet people, they also cited the profit figures of American monopoly groups. As they discussed the construction of new hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union, they thought of the American military bases built at the cost of tens of billions of dollars. Korean writer Lee Tae-jun, listening to this conversation, couldn't help but say sternly:

    "American imperialists have brought death and destruction to my land. Why? Because the Korean people want to build freely in their own country, just as the Soviet Union is building in its own..."

    The Americans silently lowered their heads. Lee Tae-jun embraced Wheaton's shoulders and said:

    "You know, we have a poet who wrote a poem during the Japanese occupation, entitled 'Spring.' This poem talks about the triumphant advance of life after the harsh winter. Spring comes, and with spring come flowers, youth, and happiness. This poem talks about the iron-like steps of history that the people hear. The Japanese occupiers, the enemies of life, have been defeated. The same fate awaits their disciples."

    During the days of the Peace Conference, these conversations in Beijing were unforgettable. News in the newspapers about the struggle of various nations for freedom and peace made our conversations lively. When Tseng Hsueh-hung from Malaya spoke of the courage of her people, of their inhuman suffering, and of the new crimes of British imperialists, it was as if a curtain had fallen from the ground, and we saw the small Malayan villages that the colonialists had broken into, burned, and killed, we saw the tropical jungles, where the heroic forces of the guerrillas were preparing new offensives, preparing new combat activities to resist the oppressors...

    From the terrace on the eighth floor of the hotel named with the most beautiful word "Peace," one can see the vast panorama of Beijing—the heart of the homeland of the numerous Chinese people. Our hands pointed south, we often praised the great Huai River, which had raged for thousands of years, bringing disaster and destruction, but now is controlled by the people and subserviently serves the people. Yes, people who have broken free from the shackles of slavery are able to create miracles, able to enhance their strength and power to benefit the world.

    The people of Asian and Pacific countries are increasingly determined to strive for the right to peaceful and constructive labor and happiness. The representatives of the Peace Conference expressed their will in the "Message to the People of the World," calling for unity and joint and continuous struggle for peace, because "in cooperation with all people of goodwill, they will certainly be able to avert the catastrophe that threatens us, eliminate the dark clouds of war, and clear the eyes of the people to welcome the dawn of universal friendship and lasting peace."

    This is the firm will they expressed in the "Resolution on the Korean Question," which called on the people of the world to demand that the United States immediately cease its unreasonable behavior that is undermining the Korean armistice negotiations, demand that the United States immediately repatriate all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, immediately prohibit and stop the use of weapons of mass destruction, including bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and napalm bombs, and also stop the bombing of peaceful cities and peaceful people in Korea by American military aircraft, and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea after the armistice, including the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    This is their powerful call that echoes in the resolutions, which demand the cessation of Japanese militarization and demand the abolition of the separate San Francisco Treaty, the cessation of cultural aggression and the strengthening of cultural exchanges between nations, warmly support the convening of the World People's Peace Congress, and demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

    北京的会见
    波兰作家　马里安·别里茨基
    我们登上了“和平宾馆”第八层楼的凉台。我们的头上，漆黑的辽阔的夜空中高悬着群星围绕的满月。我们的下面是穿透夜雾的北京街上的万家灯火。从附近一条街道上传来了喧噪的自行车铃的响声。少女们不协调地合唱着一首生疏的，但却十分优美的歌子……
    我们五个人走上了凉台。我的新朋友们是从辽远的国度里来到北京的。他们每一个人，一看到辉煌的北京，就都有自己祖国的形象，自己家乡城市的形象，涌上心头，他们不由得想起它们。我们的耳朵里依然回响着怀仁堂里洋溢的掌声（怀仁堂的意思就是“关怀人道的大厅”），亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议就是在那里举行的。
    代表们多么热诚地欢迎那些冲过美国的傀儡——吉田的哨兵线的日本人民代表的谈话啊！当日本代表为数百万日本劳动人民呼吁废除那一种迫使日本来接受令人仇恨的美国占领，来充当炮灰供应者角色的旧金山单独和约时，掌声接连不断地响了多久啊！日本人民决不接受这个被硬逼的角色。日本代表们代表着自己的人民在和平会议的讲台上谈到了这一点。
    朝鲜作家韩雪野紧紧地拥抱着哥伦比亚的代表迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉那时刻，是非常令人感动的。迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉在演说中呼吁各民族共同努力制止帝国主义在朝鲜的罪行。库艾拉在和平会议的讲台上谈到了哥伦比亚人民的悲剧的真实情况。他谈到了哥伦比亚游击队对于那一种按照希特勒式组成的、为美国坦克所卫护的戈麦思法西斯制度的英勇反抗的事迹。这位哥伦比亚人痛苦地谈到自己的国旗，这个本来象征着本国人民爱好自由的旗帜，被哥伦比亚政府的法西斯政策的可耻行为沾污了。
    我亲眼看见民主越南的战士的手与从美国来的和平战士的手亲切地握在一起。也许，就在旧金山的教师紧紧地握着越南战斗英雄阮国治的手的时候，法国的空中强盗正把美国送来的炸弹投掷在越南的安静的、和平的村庄。阮国治非常明白，在法国殖民者的背后站有美国的将军和垄断资本的主人。但是他还知道，那些为了利润使越南的土地燃烧和染满了鲜血的人，也在迫害这位从旧金山来的教师，因为他教育美国的孩子们爱和平和尊重其他的民族。
    ……厄瓜多尔的代表，仔细地观察着苏联、中国和波兰的地图，低声地念着岸上升起雄伟建筑的河流的名字，念着那些苹果快要开花和麦子开始结穗的沙漠的名字。
    “这是多么美丽呢！”他禁不住地称颂说。
    “为了达到这个，”战斗着的菲律宾的诗人马纽尔·柯鲁兹参加了谈话，“首先需要和平和独立……”
    马纽尔·柯鲁兹谈到他的祖国人民的艰巨的和英勇的斗争，谈到菲律宾人民解放军的战士怎样生活在高山和森林里，怎样与和平和祖国独立的敌人作战的情况。人民没有被监狱、恐怖和大量的枪杀所吓倒。
    北京的和平会议成了争取民族独立和世界和平斗争中亚洲及太平洋各国人民牢固团结和友爱的一面镜子。现在，当我和新朋友们谈话的时候，我更加确信了这一点。
    厄瓜多尔人第一个开始说话。
    “每天晚上，”他沉思地说：“我开完会回来，在大街上漫步，我注视着居民的脸，听着北京生活的愉快声音。随后，我们走上这个凉台，凝视着城市的景色，我总是想：中国人民走上幸福的道路的经过是多么的艰难！现在它的命运多么美丽啊！”
    “你知道，我也时常这么想，”缅甸人吴拉回答说，“我还想到，中国人民的幸福——就是我们大家的幸福……”
    我们看着北京而且感到人民中国的人们的炽烈的、创造性的、为光荣的劳动所照耀着的生活。许多国家的使者只要是在这里，在北京，终究能够明白自由人民的生活的真实情况。墨西哥的代表伊斯玛尔·科西奥·维里盖斯在和平会议的讲台上说：“那些欺骗人民想要发动战争的人们，从来不提伏尔加河—顿河运河和苏联的自动的挖掘机，也不提起波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的医学的成就”。
    加拿大的教师参加了谈话：
    “我们过着生活的这个海洋，已不是太平洋了。愤怒在千百万人的血液中沸腾，人民仇恨的浪潮冲击着帝国主义的海岸……”
    “你们注意到整个会场对苏联代表的演说是怎样的反应吗？”墨西哥的新闻记者，争取和平的战士说：“你们听到了掌声把他的演说打断了多少次吗？你们记得当他谈到在苏联只有一个基地超出了国界——就是千百万人的心的时候受到怎样的欢呼！”
    话题转变了，大家一下子都谈到苏联，谈到建设共产主义的人民，谈到这个人类幸福的国家，在这个国家里，人们学会了征服自然和改变大地的外貌。难道关于苏联所有的人都在读书的消息和社会主义国家将实施普及十年制的义务教育的消息，能够不引起每个代表的热烈响应吗？
    我想起与美国黑人钳工路易士·惠吞的会见。我在一群讨论苏联新的斯大林五年计划的数字的美国人中看见了他。他们谈论到苏联全体人民生活水平的不断增长的指标，就也举出了美国垄断集团的利润的数字。他们讨论到苏联新水电站的建设，就想起了消耗数十亿美元建造起来的美国军事基地。朝鲜作家李泰俊倾听着这段谈话，他禁不住严峻地说：
    “美国帝国主义分子把死亡和破坏带到我的土地。为了什么呢？因为朝鲜人民想在自己的国内自由地建设，就如同苏联在国内那样地建设……”
    美国人沉默地低下头。李泰俊拥抱着惠吞的肩膀说：
    “你知道，我们有一个诗人在日本占领期间写过一首诗，诗题叫‘春天’。这首诗谈到了在冬季严寒以后生活的凯旋前进。春天来到，和春天一起是鲜花、青春和幸福。这首诗谈到了人民所听到的历史的钢铁般的步伐。日本占领者、生活的敌人，已被打倒了。同样的命运也在等待着他们的门徒。”
    在和平会议的日子里，在北京的这些谈话是令人难忘的。报纸上关于各民族争取自由与和平斗争的消息使我们的谈话生动活泼。当马来亚的曾雪虹谈到自己人民的勇敢，谈到他们非人的苦难和英帝国主义分子的新罪行的时候，好像是一个帷幕从地面上掉下去，我们看见了殖民者闯进去烧杀的小马来亚的村庄，我们看见了热带的丛林，丛林中游击队的英勇部队正在准备新的进攻，准备反击压迫者的新战斗活动……。
    从以最美好的字“和平”为名的旅馆的第八层楼的凉台上，可以看到广大的北京——众多的中国人民的祖国心脏——的全貌。我们的手指向南方，我们常常赞扬地谈到伟大的淮河，淮河曾猖獗了数千年，带来过灾难和破坏，而现在却为人民辖制，驯伏地服务于人民。是的，人民摆脱了奴役的羁绊，是能够创造奇迹，能够增强自己造福世界的力量和威力的。
    亚洲及太平洋各国的人民愈益坚决地争取和平建设性劳动的权利和幸福。和平会议的代表们在号召团结和共同进行争取和平的不断的斗争的“告世界人民书”中，就表现出他们的意志，因为“他们在与一切善意的人们合作之下，一定能够避免威胁着我们的浩劫，消除战争的阴云，并廓清人们的眼界，来迎接普遍友好与持久和平的曙光。”
    这是他们在“关于朝鲜问题的决议”中所表现出的坚强的意志，这个决议号召全世界的人民要求美国立刻停止导致破坏朝鲜停战谈判的无理行为，要求美国在停止军事行动以后立刻遣返全部战俘，立刻禁止和停止使用大量杀人的武器，包括细菌武器、化学武器和凝固汽油弹，同时也要停止美国军用飞机对朝鲜和平城市和和平人民的轰炸，要求在停战后从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，其中也包括中国人民志愿军。
    这是他们响彻在决议中的强有力的呼声，这些决议要求停止日本军国主义化并要求废除单独的旧金山条约，停止对文化的侵略和加强各民族之间的文化交流，热烈拥护世界人民和平大会的召开并要求缔结五大国和平公约。（原载苏联“文学报”十月十八日）
