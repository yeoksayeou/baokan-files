Grain crops in the various ethnic minority regions of Northwest China have generally reaped a bumper harvest this year. Except for individual areas that suffered from disasters, the average yield per unit area across the region generally increased by 10 to 30 percent compared to last year. For example, in Hami County, Xinjiang Province, the average yield of wheat this year reached 369 jin per mu, an increase of 29 percent compared to last year. The county, which was originally a grain-deficient area, can not only be self-sufficient in grain this year, but is also estimated to have a surplus of more than 2.5 million jin. For another example, in Jinji, Lingwu, and other counties where the Hui people of Ningxia Province live, the average yield of rice this year is about 400 jin per mu.

The reasons for the bumper harvest of grain crops in various ethnic minority regions of Northwest China this year are: first, because the enthusiasm for production of farmers in various places has increased after land reform (Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai) and rent reduction (Xinjiang). For example, in Dazi Village, where the Tu ethnic farmers of Minhe County, Qinghai Province, live, the average yield of wheat per mu was only 16 or 17 jin in the past due to rough cultivation and other reasons. After the land reform last winter, everyone's enthusiasm for production was very high, and they paid great attention to improving farming techniques. A quarter of the village's cultivated land was plowed with iron shovels, so this year the average yield of wheat on the village's 260 mu of paddy fields was 414 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of local paddy field wheat by 30 jin. Second, it is the result of unity and mutual assistance among people of all ethnic groups on the production front, which has solved many difficulties in production. For example, after the completion of land reform in Linxia Special District, Gansu Province, where the Hui and Han ethnic groups live together, mutual aid groups composed of Hui and Han farmers are extremely common. Moving examples of unity in production between Hui and Han people have appeared everywhere, and they have solved many specific difficulties in production, such as seeds, farm tools, and draft animals. As a result, the yield of wheat per mu in this special district has generally increased by 33 jin compared to last year. Third, under the strong support of the people's government, farmers of all ethnic minorities have actively improved their farming techniques. The Mongolian farmers of Heshut County, Xinjiang, planted corn this year, and the yield per unit area doubled after fine plowing and strip sowing. Yi Ming, a farmer in Hami Hui Urban District, obtained a high yield of 440 jin per mu of wheat planted on the Gobi desert land under the guidance of Township Head Abizi after adopting techniques such as seed mixing and seed soaking, an increase of one and a half times compared to the past.

### 西北各少数民族地区粮食作物普遍丰收

    西北各少数民族地区粮食作物普遍丰收
    西北各少数民族地区的粮食作物今年普遍丰收。全区除个别地方遭受灾害外，一般单位面积产量平均比去年提高百分之十到三十。如新疆省哈密县，小麦今年每亩平均产量达三百六十九斤，比去年增产百分之二十九。该县原为缺粮地区，今年粮食不但能够自给，估计还能余粮二百五十多万斤。又如宁夏省回族人民聚居的金积、灵武等县，今年水稻每亩平均产量都在四百斤左右。
    西北区各少数民族地区今年粮食作物丰收的原因，首先是由于各地农民，经过土地改革（甘肃、宁夏、青海）和减租（新疆）生产情绪都提高了。如青海省民和县土族农民聚居的达字村，过去由于耕作粗糙等原因，每亩小麦平均只收十六、七斤。去年冬季土地改革后，大家生产情绪很高，对改进耕作技术都很注意，全村有四分之一的耕地，都用铁铣翻了一遍，所以今年全村二百六十亩水地小麦，每亩平均产量为四百一十四斤，超过了当地水地小麦的产量三十斤。其次是由于各地各族人民在生产战线上团结互助的结果，使生产中许多困难得到解决。如回、汉两族杂居的甘肃临夏专区今春完成土地改革后，回、汉族农民组成的互助组极为普遍，到处出现回、汉两族人民团结生产的动人事例，并相互解决了生产中许多具体困难，如籽种、农具、耕畜等。因而使该专区今年小麦产量每亩普遍较去年提高了三十三斤。第三是各少数民族农民在人民政府的大力扶植下，都积极改进了耕作技术。新疆和硕县的蒙族农民，今年种植玉米，经细犁条播后，单位面积产量就提高了一倍。哈密回城区农民伊明，由于在乡长阿比孜指导下，接受了拌种、浸种等技术，在戈壁漏沙地上种植的小麦，每亩还获得四百四十斤的高额产量，较过去提高了一倍半。（据新华社讯）
