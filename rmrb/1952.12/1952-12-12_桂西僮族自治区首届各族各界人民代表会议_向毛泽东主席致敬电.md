    First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region
    Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong
Respected Chairman Mao:
    In accordance with your ethnic policies and the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," we convened the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, from December 6th to 9th. All the delegates present fully promoted the spirit of unity and friendship, and through democratic discussion and consultation, formulated the organizational regulations of the Autonomous Region People's Government, adopted the program for the implementation of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and elected the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and members of the Autonomous Region People's Government, formally establishing the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government. At the same time, the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and members of the Consultative Committee of the People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Autonomous Region were elected. Before liberation, under reactionary rule, what our minority ethnic groups encountered was discrimination, oppression, and plunder, living a miserable life in darkness. In the three years since liberation, thanks to the correct implementation of your great ethnic policies, we have gained equal status in politics; thanks to your concern, care, and vigorous support, our economic and cultural lives have gradually improved. Today, we have obtained the right to autonomy, and have our own political power to be masters of our own affairs. This has opened up infinitely bright and happy prospects for us. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you on behalf of the more than 6.2 million people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region! We assure you that the people of all ethnic groups in our Autonomous Region will unite closely, use our diligence to jointly develop our economy and culture, and create our beautiful life. We will always follow you and, under your leadership, unite closely with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to strive to build a large, loving family for the people of all ethnic groups in China!
        All Representatives of the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province
             December 9, 1952
