    Taiyuan City Emphasizes Cultivating and Protecting Model Workers and Rationally Allocating Employees' Leisure Time

    Editor: Over the past three years, state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan City have generally experienced a serious situation of long hours spent in employees' collective activities after work, numerous meetings, and cadres holding multiple positions. Employees often do not get enough rest, their bodies are excessively fatigued and cannot recover, illnesses increase, and both their studies and production are affected. This situation is especially serious among model workers and activists, which makes them deeply feel that "being a model is not easy," and some have even been unable to maintain the honorary title of model worker as a result. In order to solve the above serious problems, after much discussion and research, we issued on November 1st the "Regulations on the Unified Allocation of Employees' Leisure Time for Collective Activities in State-owned and Locally State-owned Factories and Mines" and the "Regulations (Draft) on Cultivating and Protecting Model Workers in State-owned and Locally State-owned Factories and Mines." The main contents of these two regulations are as follows:

    I. The Party committees of all factories and mines must effectively control the rational allocation of employees' leisure time for collective activities to ensure employees' health and regular, planned political, cultural, and technical learning, improve employees' labor productivity, and ensure the orderly completion of various tasks according to plan. Those who violate the municipal Party committee's regulations will be subject to Party criticism.

    II. Solving the problem of cadres, model workers, and activists holding too many positions concurrently is a prerequisite for realizing the rational allocation of leisure time. Generally, employees can hold a maximum of one concurrent position, and model workers can hold no more than two. It is best that the main positions in the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League systems are not held concurrently with each other, so that they each have a specific job, a clear division of labor, and can effectively play the role of each organization under the unified leadership of the Party.

    III. Rationally and uniformly allocating employees' leisure time and establishing a system to strictly control it is an effective way to solve the problem of long hours spent in employees' collective activities after work. In this regard, it is necessary to vigorously improve working methods, reduce some unnecessary meetings, merge some meetings with repetitive content, and hold necessary meetings with full preparation, distinguishing between the importance and urgency, and concentrating efforts to focus on solving problems. It is stipulated that the collective leisure time for general employees should not exceed twelve hours per week, and the night shift workers on three shifts should have even less than twelve hours. On Sundays, cultural and recreational activities can be organized to liven up workers' lives, but no meetings or classes should be held to avoid affecting workers' recovery from fatigue. The leisure time of model workers should be even more strictly controlled. In addition to ensuring that they have enough rest time like ordinary employees, they should be given a certain amount of vacation time each year and have regular physical examinations to protect their health.

    IV. Correctly cultivate and use model workers, and give full play to the leading, backbone, and bridge role of model workers in production. Leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League systems in all factories and mines should always pay attention to discovering model figures, promptly summarize and disseminate their model deeds to promote work. The Party committees of all factories and mines should appoint a dedicated person to conduct systematic political education for model workers to improve their political awareness and enable them to always maintain contact with the masses. The technical management departments should appoint specialized engineering and technical personnel to help model workers improve their technical and business levels, so that they can always maintain the role of advanced banner under their continuous efforts.

    V. Strictly regulate the meeting and visiting system for model workers. In the past, due to numerous visits and a lack of unified control and planning, model workers were overwhelmed with receptions; and some visitors had unclear purposes, and both parties lacked sufficient preparation in advance for the talks, resulting in a lot of wasted time. Therefore, we have stipulated various systems to solve this problem, such as: visitors should explain the purpose of the visit and raise questions in advance, and be received only after obtaining the consent of the factory and mine leaders; if it is not necessary for the model worker to personally receive the visitor, a dedicated person can be designated to receive them on their behalf. For nationally known model workers, a full-time (or part-time) secretary should be assigned who has a certain political level, is familiar with the business, and especially familiar with the model worker's experience and model deeds, to specifically help the model worker organize materials, meet guests, and carry out various tasks to reduce the burden on the model worker.

    Since November, state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan City have begun to implement the above regulations. The implementation situation, problems, and experiences will continue to be reflected later.

### 太原市重视培养和保护劳模合理支配职工业余活动时间

    太原市重视培养和保护劳模合理支配职工业余活动时间
    编辑同志：三年来，太原市各国营、地方国营厂矿普遍存在着职工业余集体活动时间长，会议多，干部兼职多的严重情况。职工们经常得不到足够的休息时间，身体过度疲劳不能恢复，疾病增加，学习和生产都受到了影响。这种情况特别是在劳动模范和积极分子中更加严重，这就使他们深深感到“模范不起”，有的人甚至因此而不能继续保持劳动模范的光荣称号了。我们为了解决以上严重问题，经过多方面讨论和研究，在十一月一日发出了“关于国营、地方国营厂矿职工业余集体活动时间统一支配的规定”和“关于在国营、地方国营厂矿内培养、保护劳动模范的规定”（草案）。这两个规定的主要内容如下：
    一、各厂矿党委必须切实掌握职工业余集体活动时间的合理支配，以保障职工健康和经常有计划的政治、文化、技术学习，提高职工劳动生产效率，保证按计划有秩序地完成各项工作。如有违犯市委规定者，要受到党的批评。
    二、解决干部、劳动模范、积极分子兼职过多的问题是实现合理支配业余活动时间的先决条件。一般职工最多只能兼一职，劳动模范的兼职最多不得超过两职。党、行政、工会、青年团各系统的主要职务，最好不要互相兼任，以便使他们各有专职，明确分工，在党的统一领导下，有效地发挥各组织的作用。
    三、合理地统一分配职工业余活动时间，订出制度，严格掌握，这是解决职工业余集体活动时间长的有效方法。在这方面，必须注意大力改善工作方法，减少一些不必要的会议，合并某些内容重复的会议，不得不开的会也要有充分准备，分别轻重缓急，集中精力有重点的解决问题。规定一般职工的业余集体活动时间每周不能超过十二小时，三班制的夜班工人还应少于十二小时。星期日可以组织文化娱乐活动，活跃工人生活，但不得开会或上课，以免影响工人恢复疲劳。对于劳动模范的业余活动时间更应严格控制，除保证他们和一般职工一样有足够的休息时间外，每年给他们一定的休假期，定期检查身体，保护他们的健康。
    四、正确地培养和使用劳动模范，充分发挥劳动模范在生产中的带头、骨干和桥梁作用。各厂矿党、行政、工会、青年团各系统领导干部要经常注意发现模范人物，及时总结和传播他们的模范事迹，以推动工作。各厂矿党委要指定专人对劳动模范进行系统的政治教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们永远保持与群众的联系。技术管理部门要指定专门工程技术人员帮助劳动模范提高技术和业务水平，在他们的不断努力下，使他们经常保持先进旗帜作用。
    五、严格规定劳动模范的会客和访问制度。过去，由于访问繁多，缺乏统一的掌握和计划，使劳动模范迎接不暇；而有些访问者目的性不明确，双方面的谈话事先都缺乏充分准备，以致浪费了很多时间。因此，我们规定了解决这一问题的各种制度，如：访问者事先应说明访问目的，提出问题，经厂矿领导干部同意后，再接见；不必劳动模范亲自接见的，可以指定专人代为接见。对于全国性知名的劳动模范，应指派一个有一定政治水平，熟悉业务，特别是熟悉劳动模范的经历和模范事迹的人，担任专任（或兼任）秘书，具体地帮助劳动模范整理材料、会客和进行各种工作，以减轻劳动模范的负担。
    从十一月份起，太原市各国营、地方国营厂矿已开始实行以上规定。执行的情况、问题和经验以后当继续反映。
