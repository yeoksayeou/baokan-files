    Elects Delegation to the World People's Peace Congress and Passes Mandate
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th] According to TASS, the Fourth All-Soviet Peace Congress concluded victoriously in Moscow on the afternoon of the 4th. Before the closing of the congress, discussions continued on the report by Petrovsky, President of Moscow University. The Soviet Peace Committee and the Soviet delegation to the World People's Peace Congress were elected. The congress also passed a mandate for the Soviet delegation to the World People's Peace Congress.
    During the discussion of Petrovsky's report, Yekaterina Podsobriyeva spoke about the achievements of peace construction by textile workers in the Ivanovo region. On behalf of the textile workers of the Ivanovo region, she called on textile workers and mothers from the United States, Britain, France, Japan, India, Egypt, and the rest of the world to rise up and stop the bloodthirsty imperialists, and to lodge angry protests against the war-mongers and child-killing murderers.
    Alexander Gerasimov, President of the Soviet Academy of Arts, stated that Soviet artists have contributed all their creative efforts and all their thoughts to the cause of strengthening friendship among the people of all countries. We urge progressive artists around the world to also contribute all their strength, talent, and creative efforts to the sacred struggle to defend peace.
    Soviet People's Artist Akaki Khorava (Georgian Republic) described the great achievements of the Georgian people in developing their economy and culture. He emphasized that we have millions of peace-loving friends from all over the world with us. We are working under the guidance of the greatest humanitarian, the friend of all working people—the great Stalin.
    After Khorava's speech, the discussion of Petrovsky's report concluded. A total of eighty-five delegates spoke during the three-day discussion.
    Next, the meeting announced a portion of the congratulatory telegrams and letters received by the congress. These included congratulatory telegrams from the World Peace Council, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, as well as peace organizations from Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and other countries. Numerous congratulatory telegrams and letters from various cities and villages in the Soviet Union expressed the firm determination of the Soviet people to consolidate world peace with all their might.
    The congress then elected the Soviet Peace Committee. The congress delegates unanimously elected one hundred and twenty-seven members, including advanced workers, collective farm members, and prominent scientists and cultural figures.
    The congress unanimously elected a Soviet delegation of fifty people to attend the World People's Peace Congress.
    The congress passed a mandate for the Soviet delegation to the World People's Peace Congress. The mandate stated that the Fourth All-Soviet Peace Congress authorizes the Soviet delegation to declare that the Soviet people are determined to defend the cause of peace and are willing to cooperate with all those who sincerely strive to prevent war, strengthen friendship among peoples, and expand economic and cultural exchanges among countries. The congress authorizes the Soviet delegates to express agreement with the activities carried out by the World Peace Council for the purpose of developing and strengthening the peace movement; to support the demands for safeguarding the national independence and sovereignty of all peoples; to endorse ensuring the security of all peoples and the inviolability of their territories, the free choice of their way of life, and the extensive economic and cultural exchanges among peoples on the basis of equality; to demand an end to the military aggression against Korea and the swift conclusion of an armistice agreement on the basis of compliance with international agreements and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea; to firmly condemn the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors; to demand the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and to severely punish those guilty of using these weapons; and to firmly advocate the realization of the unanimous demand of the people of all countries for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. The mandate emphasizes that we demand that all Soviet people and peace-loving friends in all countries intensify the struggle to defend peace and tirelessly expose the conspiracies of the war-mongers. The power of peace is invincible. Peace must be saved, and it certainly can be saved!
    Finally, the congress delegates passed a telegram of salute to the greatest peace fighter, Stalin, with unparalleled excitement.
    With this, the Fourth All-Soviet Peace Congress declared a victorious conclusion.
