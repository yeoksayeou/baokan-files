Xinhua News Agency, London, December 26th: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party has issued a statement regarding the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which is scheduled to open on the 27th, according to a TASS report from London.

    The statement begins by pointing out that the peoples of the British Empire are facing a crisis at the time of this conference. The brutal war against the people of Malaya is in its fifth year. New methods of terror and persecution are being used against the people of Kenya. A fascist racial policy is being implemented in South Africa.

    The statement continues, "Sharp economic contradictions are arising between the governments of Britain and countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada on issues such as trade policy, import cuts, and the exchange of pounds for dollars. However, the economic and political control exercised by the American rulers over the governments of the British Empire has plunged them into ever-deepening difficulties and crises. At the same time, the Korean War launched by the United States is forcing British youth to make pointless sacrifices." The statement emphasizes America's aggressive policy toward Britain, saying, "American imperialists are gradually controlling the countries of the British Empire. It is openly launching an offensive against the entire imperial preferential system and the sterling area. The aim of American economic strategy is to open up the markets of the British Empire to accommodate American exports, control sources of raw materials, and subject the economies of the British Empire countries to the intrusion and manipulation of American capital."

    The statement says, "Because the policies of the Prime Ministers of the Dominions are linked to the orders of American imperialism, they cannot solve the problems arising from this situation."

    The British Communist Party declares that the vital interests of the peoples of the British Empire require a complete change of current policies. The Communist Party fights for the national independence of the peoples of the British Empire, for the end of imperialist exploitation, and for the economic and political cooperation of the peoples of the current Empire to raise living standards and safeguard world peace.

    The common interests of the peoples of the British Empire require the following actions:

    1. Resolutely oppose the control of American imperialism, expand trade relations between the countries of the British Empire to promote mutual benefit, and expand friendly trade relations with other parts of the world.
    2. Oppose the deepening exploitation of the peoples of all countries by American and British imperialism, end the bloody wars in Korea and Malaya, and fully support the demands of the colonial peoples for freedom and national independence.
    3. Unite against the reactionary war alliance formed with American imperialism, and oppose the expansion of armaments programs that place heavy burdens on the peoples of the British Empire and lower their living standards.

    All current political, economic, and military enslavement-based relationships between the peoples of the British Empire must be abolished, and replaced by relationships based on full national independence and equal rights.

    The British Communist Party calls on the British people to unite with the peoples of the British Empire to fight for common interests and world peace, and points out that united action will strengthen the struggle to restore British national independence, and will also accelerate the liberation of the peoples of the colonies and dependent countries.
Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: London News: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, after five months of preparation, opened in London on the 27th. A communiqué issued after the opening meeting stated that the conference would discuss issues related to the Commonwealth's finances, trade, and economic development.

    British officials have stated that this conference is the most important since the 1932 Ottawa Conference, where Commonwealth countries established a protective system of imperial preferential tariffs. According to a United Press report, this conference will seek ways to "expand (British) trade" and "earn more and spend fewer dollars." British Prime Minister Churchill said in his opening speech, "This conference is of great importance to the future prosperity of the Commonwealth."

    During the first day of the conference, representatives from Australia, New Zealand, and Pakistan all advocated restoring the free convertibility of the pound. However, according to a United Press report, Britain's view is that in order to consider the issue of pound convertibility, it is first necessary to balance the budgets of not only the Commonwealth countries but also all countries in the sterling area, and to stabilize this balance. On this issue, it had been rumored before the conference that Commonwealth countries such as Canada and Australia, which are increasingly reliant on the United States, would insist on the American viewpoint and advocate free convertibility of the pound. Britain fears that this approach would facilitate the further penetration of dollar power into the sterling area and has expressed its opposition. This division within the Commonwealth reflects the sharp contradiction between the dollar and the pound.

    Among the broad range of topics to be discussed is the issue of Britain's participation in the aggressive US-Australia-New Zealand pact. It has been revealed that Britain will urge Australia and New Zealand to support Britain's position and oppose the United States' exclusion of Britain.

    英共就英联邦总理会议发表声明
    号召英国人民团结一致恢复英国民族独立
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：英国共产党政治委员会就二十七日开幕的联邦总理会议发表声明。
    声明首先指出：这次会议举行时，英帝国各国人民正遭遇着危机。对马来亚人民进行的残酷战争已是第五年了。对怯尼亚人民正使用着新的恐怖和迫害方法。在南非正在实行着一种法西斯种族政策。
    声明继续说：“英国和澳大利亚、新西兰及加拿大等国的政府之间，在贸易政策、削减入口及英镑美元的兑换等问题上正发生着尖锐的经济矛盾。但是，英帝国各国政府屈从于美国统治者的经济和政治上的控制，已使它们陷入愈来愈深的困难与危机之中。同时，美国发动的朝鲜战争迫使英国青年作无谓的牺牲。”声明强调美国对英国实行侵略性的政策说：“美国帝国主义者正在逐渐控制英帝国各国。它对于整个帝国优惠制度和英镑地区正在公然展开攻势。美国的经济战略的目的是要打开英帝国的市场，使其容纳美国的出口货，控制原料来源和使英帝国各国的经济听凭美国资本的侵入和操纵。”
    声明说：“因为各自治领的总理们的政策都是与美国帝国主义的命令连结着的，所以他们不能解决这种情况所引起的各项问题。”
    英国共产党宣布：英帝国各国人民的切身利益要求完全改变现在的政策。共产党为争取英帝国各国人民的民族独立而斗争，为终止帝国主义的剥削而斗争，为争取目前帝国各国人民的经济和政治上的合作，以提高生活水准和维护世界和平而斗争。
    英帝国各国人民的共同利益要求采取下列行动：
    一、坚决反对美帝国主义的控制，扩展英帝国各国间的贸易关系以增进彼此的利益、并扩展与世界其他各地的友好贸易关系。
    二、反对美英两国帝国主义对各国人民日益加深的剥削，终止在朝鲜和马来亚的血腥战争，全力支持殖民地人民对自由和民族独立的要求。
    三、团结起来反对与美帝国主义结成的反动战争联盟，反对使英帝国各国人民担负沉重负担并降低他们的生活水准的扩张军备计划。
    目前英帝国各国人民间以政治、经济、军事的奴役为基础的一切关系，必须予以废除，而代之以充分的民族独立与平等权利为基础的关系。
    英国共产党号召英国人民与英帝国各国人民团结一致为共同的利益与争取世界和平而斗争，并且指出：团结一致的行动将加强争取恢复英国民族独立的斗争，也将加速殖民地和附属国人民的解放。
    【新华社二十九日讯】伦敦消息：英联邦总理会议经过五个月的筹备后已于二十七日在伦敦开幕。开幕会议后发表的公报说，会议将讨论有关英联邦财政、贸易和经济发展等各项问题。
    英国官方表示这次会议是一九三二年英联邦国家制订保护性的帝国特惠关税制度的渥太华会议以后最重要的一次会议。据合众社消息，本届会议将寻求“扩大（英国）贸易”和“赚取更多而花费更少美元”的办法。英国首相邱吉尔在开幕词里说：“这次会议对于英联邦将来的繁荣是十分重要的。”
    在第一天会议上，澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦代表都在发言中主张恢复英镑的自由兑换。但是，据合众社报道，英国的意见是：要考虑英镑兑换问题，首先必须使不仅是联邦国家而且是整个英镑地区各国的预算平衡起来并使这种平衡稳定下去。关于这个问题，会前早就传说：日益依靠美国的加拿大、澳大利亚等联邦国家将坚持美国的观点，主张英镑自由兑换，英国害怕这种作法将便利美元势力进一步打入英镑地区而表示反对。英联邦内部的这种分歧反映出美元和英镑的尖锐矛盾。
    在将要讨论的广泛议题中间，还包括英国参加侵略性的美、澳、新公约问题，据透露，英国将促使澳大利亚、新西兰支持英国立场，反对美国排斥英国参加。
