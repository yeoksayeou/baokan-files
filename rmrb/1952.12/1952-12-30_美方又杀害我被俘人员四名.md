Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 29th. According to the U.S. side, on December 23rd, 24th, and 25th, the U.S. side successively killed four more of our captured personnel in the Koje-do, Jeju-do, and Busan prisoner-of-war camps. Since the United Nations General Assembly passed the illegal resolution approving the U.S. side's detention and massacre of prisoners of war, according to materials disclosed by the U.S. side itself, more than 220 prisoners of war have been killed or wounded. Among them, on December 14th, at the Pongam-do prisoner-of-war camp, the U.S. side, by using force to compel the transfer of prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder, killed or wounded more than 200 prisoners of war.

    Regarding the recent incidents of murdering prisoners of war, the U.S. side uses absurd excuses such as prisoners of war "hanging themselves" and "attempting to organize illegal night meetings" to conceal its beastly and ugly face. However, the facts are very clear: under the approval and encouragement of the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. side, following the Pongam-do massacre, is now boldly and recklessly using massacre tactics in various prisoner-of-war camps to forcibly transfer large numbers of prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang to replenish the ROK army, as a gamble for the further military adventures that the U.S. side is planning. Many prisoners of war who have been forced to join the ROK army have already fallen into the hands of the Korean and Chinese side, and the U.S. side has so far not dared to deny this serious crime that has been exposed.

    美方又杀害我被俘人员四名
    【新华社开城二十九日电】据美方宣布，十二月二十三日、二十四日、二十五日，美方在巨济岛、济州岛和釜山战俘营内又接连杀害我方被俘人员四名。自联合国大会通过批准美方扣留和屠杀战俘的非法决议以来，仅据美方自己透露的材料，就又有战俘二百二十多名被打死打伤。其中十二月十四日在蜂岩岛战俘营内，美方因为用武力强迫把战俘移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰，打死打伤战俘二百多名。
    对于最近发生的谋杀战俘事件，美方用所谓战俘“上吊自杀”，“企图组织非法夜间会议”等荒谬藉口来遮掩其兽性的丑恶嘴脸。但是，事实非常清楚：在联合国大会所通过的非法决议的批准和鼓励之下，美方继蜂岩岛大屠杀后，正放手大胆地在各个战俘营内用屠杀手段把大批战俘强迫移交给李承晚匪帮补充到李伪军中去，作为美方正在计划的进一步军事冒险的赌本。许多被强迫参加李伪军的战俘，已经落在朝中方面的手里，而美方至今不敢否认这个已被揭露的严重罪行。
