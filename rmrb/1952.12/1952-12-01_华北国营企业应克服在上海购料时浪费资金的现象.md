    North China State-Owned Enterprises Should Overcome the Phenomenon of Wasting Funds When Purchasing Materials in Shanghai
    Editor: I work in the purchasing and sales office in Shanghai for the five provinces and two cities of North China. Since late July of this year, we have launched a patriotic labor competition. During the competition, we discovered that some state-owned enterprises in North China have a serious problem of stockpiling funds for purchasing materials. Although we placed the issue of accelerating the turnover of purchasing and sales funds of various units in its proper place during the patriotic labor competition, and reduced the amount of stockpiled funds by about 20% after nearly three months of work, the problem has not been completely resolved. This issue involves a wide range of factors and cannot be solved by us alone. I am raising it so that relevant parties will pay attention and find ways to solve it.

    Judging from the funds used by certain enterprises in North China for purchasing materials in Shanghai, the formal business expenditure is only about 20 billion yuan per month (excluding cooperatives, troops, and various specialized companies), but according to the books of various units, the daily amount stored in the bank waiting for purchasing materials is often no less than 12 billion yuan. This shows that the funds used by various units for purchasing materials are being wasted considerably. I believe the reasons for this are as follows:

    1. Relevant material supply units in Shanghai cannot supply material users on time and accurately. There are many people purchasing materials, but few people handling the supply units, so the time is prolonged.

    2. The material purchase plans formulated by various enterprise units are not accurate. Some units have made plans, but in reality, they only purchase 30% or 20% of the planned amount. In addition, some leading organizations are very rough when approving purchase plans, which further encourages the "plan loosely, use sparingly" mentality of some units.

    3. Some systems are not reasonable enough. For example, when state-owned enterprises order goods from other state-owned enterprises, the advance deposit accounts for 30% of the total value of the goods. Individual units (East China Industrial Department) even charged advance deposits of more than 60% (most of which have now been cancelled). In addition, some supply units (Shanghai Hardware, Trust, and other specialized companies) allow purchasing units to frequently deposit a portion of cash with the company while waiting to purchase materials. According to comrades from the Shanghai People's Bank, the advance deposits paid by national purchasing units to the East China Industrial Department account for a large proportion of the department's entire funds.

    In order to correct the above unreasonable phenomena, we have made the following suggestions to relevant units:

    First, abolish the method of having purchasing units deposit funds in supply units, and concentrate all these funds in the state bank.

    Second, the funds prepared by the material using departments of various state-owned enterprises for purchasing materials in Shanghai should be planned and used uniformly by the representative agencies (all of which now exist nationwide) stationed in Shanghai by the major administrative regions. This can better implement procurement policies and save a lot of funds. Under the current circumstances, adopting this method of organizing and using purchase funds is more appropriate.

    Third, when the financial and economic committees of various provinces and cities review plans, they should educate their undertakers to carefully review and approve them, instead of generically approving them as "machinery," "medicine," or "hardware materials." Because generic approval of plans will encourage the planning units to be perfunctory when making plans, opening the door to "planning loosely, using sparingly."

### 华北国营企业应克服在上海购料时浪费资金的现象

    华北国营企业应克服在上海购料时浪费资金的现象
    编辑同志：我在华北区五省二市驻上海购销处工作。从本年七月下旬起，我们开展了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，在竞赛过程中，发现华北有些国营企业用于购料的款项，有严重的积压现象。虽然我们在爱国主义劳动竞赛中，把加速各单位的购销资金周转问题放到应有的地位，经过近三个月的工作，把资金积压数量减少了百分之二十上下，但还未彻底解决了这个问题。这个问题牵涉很广，不是我们所能单独解决的，特提出来，以便引起有关方面的注意，设法加以解决。
    按照华北区某些企业单位在上海用于购料的资金看来，每月正式业务支出不过二百亿元左右（合作社、部队、各专业公司在外），而从各单位的账簿上看，每日存放在银行等待购料的数字，经常不下
    一百二十亿元。这说明了各单位用于购料的资金是相当浪费的。它的原因，我认为有以下几点：
    一、上海市有关供料单位，不能按时准确地供应用料单位，购料的人多，供料单位的办事人少，因此时间拖的很长。
    二、各企业单位制订的购料计划不准确，有些单位虽然作了计划，但实际只购计划数的百分之三十或百分之二十。加上某些领导机关批核购料计划时很粗糙，更助长了某些单位的“宽打窄用”的心理。
    三、有些制度不够合理。如国营企业对国营企业订货，预付订金数占货物总值百分之三十。个别单位（华东工业部）竟收预付定金百分之六十以上
    （目前多已取消）。还有的供料单位（上海五金、信托以及其他专业公司）让购料单位经常存放到该公司一部分现款，等待购料。据上海人民银行同志反映，全国购料单位向华东工业部缴的预付定金，竟占该部整个资金的很大比重。
    为了纠正上述不合理的现象，我们对有关单位提出如下建议：
    第一、取消各购料单位在供料单位存款的办法，把这些款项全部集中起来，存在国家银行。
    第二、各国营企业的用料部门准备在上海购料的资金，一律由大行政区派驻上海的代表机关（全国现在都有此组织）统一筹划使用。这样既可更好地贯彻采购政策，又可节省许多资金。在目前情况下采用这样组织起来使用购料资金的办法，是比较合适的。
    第三、各省市财政经济委员会审核计划时，应教育其承办人细致地加以批核，不要笼统地批作“机器类”、“医药类”、“五金材料”等。因为笼统地批核计划，会助长计划单位作计划时马虎应付，给“宽打窄用”开了方便之门。
