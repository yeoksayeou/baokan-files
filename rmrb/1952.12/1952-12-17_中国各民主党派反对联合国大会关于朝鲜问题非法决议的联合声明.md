The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, adopted an illegal resolution on the Korean question on December 3, 1952, based on the Indian proposal. This resolution is a disguised form of the U.S. government's bloody plan to violate the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, with the aim of continuing and expanding the Korean War. Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, in his reply to Mr. Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, on December 14, sternly refuted this absurd and illegal resolution and put forward the just proposition of our government for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question on a fair and reasonable basis. We express our full and unanimous support for our government's solemn position and just proposition!

The Korean armistice negotiations have been going on for a year and a half. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, a draft Korean armistice agreement was finally reached. However, in order to continue and expand its war of aggression against Korea and maintain international tension, so as to fulfill its conspiracy to expand armaments and prepare for war and undermine peace, the U.S. government deliberately created unreasonable excuses such as "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation," violated the agreed-upon prisoner repatriation regulations, forcibly detained a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and continued to carry out bloody crimes such as forced screening, torture, tattooing, and unilateral treatment of prisoners of war. The Korean War has not yet been stopped, and the world's people's desire for peace has not yet been realized. The responsibility lies entirely with the U.S. government, which is implementing this evil policy.

The illegal resolution on the Korean question adopted by the United Nations General Assembly based on the Indian proposal, while formally playing the trick of citing clauses from the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, in essence, violates the humanitarian principles of this convention and directly tears up Article 118 of the convention, which clearly stipulates the unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities. The so-called "no force should be used against prisoners of war to prevent or compel them to return home" is, in fact, a cunning way to support the U.S. government's barbaric crime of forcibly detaining a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Such an absurd resolution can never lead to an armistice in Korea, but only seeks an excuse for the U.S. government's evil conspiracy to continue and expand its war of aggression against Korea. This is what all Chinese people firmly oppose.

In June 1950, the U.S. government launched a war of aggression against the Korean people and immediately drove its followers in the United Nations to participate in this criminal act. In February 1951, the U.S. government manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass a shameful resolution slandering the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor." Now, the U.S. government is again using the United Nations General Assembly to pass an absurd resolution that violates the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and forcibly detains prisoners of war, attempting to turn the United Nations into a tool of the U.S. government's policy of aggression. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people of the world.

The Chinese people deeply love peace. We want peace for China, we want peace for Korea, and we want lasting peace for the whole world and all mankind. We have always advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean question on a fair and reasonable basis. In his reply to Mr. Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our Central People's Government, once again put forward the just proposition for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly cancel the illegal resolution of December 3, instruct the U.S. government to immediately resume the Panmunjom negotiations, first implement a comprehensive ceasefire based on the draft Korean armistice agreement, and then hand over the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war to the "Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question" proposed by the Soviet delegation for resolution. Only this plan is the only way to promote the realization of an armistice and peace in Korea. We fully agree with and firmly support this reasonable and just proposition of our Central People's Government and call on the people of the whole country to continue to unite as one, adhere to the just struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, oppose this absurd and unlawful resolution of the United Nations, expose the U.S. government's conspiracy to continuing and expanding the Korean War, and strive to the end for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question!

    中国各民主党派反对联合国大会关于朝鲜问题非法决议的联合声明
    联合国第七届大会在没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加之下，于一九五二年十二月三日根据印度提案通过了关于朝鲜问题的非法决议。这一决议是美国政府破坏日内瓦战俘公约、强迫扣留朝中战俘的血腥方案的改装，是以继续和扩大朝鲜战争为目的的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在十二月十四日致联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生的复电中严正地驳斥了这个荒谬的非法决议，并提出了我国政府在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的正义主张。我们对于我国政府的严正立场和正义主张，表示全力的一致的拥护！
    朝鲜停战谈判已进行了一年半。由于朝中方面坚持不懈的努力，朝鲜停战协定草案始得达成。但美国政府为了继续并扩大侵朝战争，保持国际紧张局势，以遂其扩军备战、破坏和平的阴谋，竟故造“自愿遣返”“不得强迫遣返”等无理藉口，破坏双方业已协议的遣俘规定，强迫扣留大批朝中战俘，并继续施行强迫甄别、拷打、刺字、片面处理战俘等血腥罪行。朝鲜战争至今不能停止，全世界人民对于和平的渴望至今不能实现，其责任完全在于执行这种罪恶政策的美国政府。
    联合国大会根据印度提案通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，形式上虽然也玩弄着引用日内瓦战俘公约词句的把戏，但实质上破坏了这一公约的人道主义原则，更直接地撕毁了该公约第一百一十八条关于战争停止后必须无条件释放并遣返全部战俘的明确规定；所谓“不应对战俘施用武力以阻止或强使他们回返家乡”，事实上就是以狡骗的方式支持了美国政府强迫扣留大批朝中战俘的野蛮罪行。这样一个荒谬的决议绝不可能导致朝鲜停战，不过为美国政府继续和扩大侵朝战争的罪恶阴谋寻找藉口而已。这是全中国人民所坚决反对的。
    一九五○年六月，美国政府发动了对朝鲜人民的侵略战争，紧跟着就驱使联合国中它的追随者参加这一罪恶行动。一九五一年二月，美国政府操纵联合国大会通过了诽谤中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的无耻决议。现在美国政府又利用联合国大会通过了破坏日内瓦战俘公约、强迫扣留战俘的荒谬决议，企图使联合国日益变为美国政府侵略政策的工具。这是中国和全世界爱好和平与坚持正义的人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    中国人民是酷爱和平的，我们要中国的和平，我们要朝鲜的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。我们一贯主张在公平合理的基础上，和平解决朝鲜问题。周恩来外长在致联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生的复电中代表我中央人民政府再一次提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正义主张，要求联合国大会取消十二月三日的非法决议，责成美国政府立即恢复板门店谈判，根据朝鲜停战协定草案首先实行全面停战，然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交由苏联代表团所建议的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决。只有这个方案才是促成朝鲜停战实现和平的唯一途径。我们完全同意并坚决拥护我中央人民政府这一合理的、正义的主张，并号召全国人民继续团结一致，坚持抗美援朝的正义斗争，反对联合国这一荒谬的非法决议，揭露美国政府继续并扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底！中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会中国共产党中国国民党革命委员会中国民主同盟中国民主建国会中国人民政治协商会议无党派民主人士中国民主促进会中国农工民主党中国致公党九三学社台湾民主自治同盟中国新民主主义青年团一九五二年十二月十六日
