Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 24th: Korean public opinion unanimously condemns the bloody atrocities of the United States in massacring a large number of our captured personnel on Pongam Island. The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 22nd, stating: The death camp—Pongam Island near Geoje Island—has now become a second Geoje Island. The commentary pointed out: Our captured personnel, under the inhumane atrocities of the enemy, are unyieldingly demanding to return to their motherland, and their resolute struggle has thoroughly exposed the truth of the enemy's so-called "humanitarianism," "respect for the free will of prisoners of war," and "voluntary repatriation." The commentary emphasized: The massacre of POWs on Pongam Island is connected to the podium of the United Nations in New York. As everyone knows, regarding the Korean issue, the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations has passed the shameful "resolution" proposed by India, which disguises the US aggressors' poisonous scheme of "voluntary repatriation" on the POW issue. Therefore, the creators and supporters of this "resolution" must answer for the massacre on Pongam Island and provide the necessary explanation for these unprecedented bloody tragedies that occurred under the guise of "voluntary repatriation." The commentary pointed out: In the process of creating these bloody tragedies, the US aggressors had to admit that from January of this year to the present, they have killed and wounded 1,900 of our captured personnel. However, according to the materials we have obtained, the number of our captured personnel killed and wounded by the US side during the same period has reached more than 4,000. The commentary pointed out: The people of Korea and China can never sit idly by while the Americans torture and massacre our brothers and sisters in batches every day and every hour. We resolutely demand, in the name of peace-loving people all over the world, that the US aggressors who ordered the massacre of our captured personnel and the executioners who directly carried out the massacre be punished.
    "Democratic Korea" newspaper published a special article on the 19th, pointing out: A wolf is still a wolf even if it is wearing sheep's clothing. Therefore, even though the US imperialists' vicious policy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war is cloaked in the guise of the Indian proposal, it cannot deceive anyone. The massacre on Pongam Island has more clearly exposed the truth of the US imperialists' so-called "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy, which has long been shattered. This atrocity of the US imperialists can only further arouse the indignation of all kind people in the world.

    朝鲜舆论界痛斥美国在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】朝鲜舆论界一致声讨美国在蜂岩岛大批屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行。朝鲜中央通讯社在二十二日发表评论说：在死亡营——巨济岛附近的蜂岩岛，现在已经变成第二个巨济岛了。评论指出：我方被俘人员在敌人惨无人道的暴行之下，宁死不屈地要求返回祖国的坚决斗争，已经彻底揭露了敌人所叫嚣的“人道主义”、“尊重战俘自由意志”与“自愿遣返”的真相。评论着重指出：蜂岩岛的屠杀战俘事件，是和纽约联合国的讲台相连接的。大家都知道，关于朝鲜问题，联合国第七届大会已通过了印度所提出的、把美国侵略者在战俘问题上所坚持的“自愿遣返”的毒计加以伪装的可耻的“决议案”。因此，这个
    “决议案”的制造者和支持者都必须对这次蜂岩岛的屠杀事件作答复，都必须对发生在“自愿遣返”幌子下的这些史无前例的流血惨案作必要的交代。评论指出：美国侵略者在制造这些血腥惨案的过程中，曾不得不承认从今年一月起到现在已经打死打伤我方被俘人员一千九百人。但是，据我们所得的材料，在同一期间被美方杀伤的我方被俘人员已达四千多人。评论指出：朝中两国人民决不能坐视美国人每日每时成批地拷打和屠杀我们的兄弟姊妹的暴行。我们坚决要求以全世界爱好和平人民的名义，惩办下令屠杀我方被俘人员的美国侵略者和直接屠杀他们的刽子手们。
    “民主朝鲜”报在十九日发表专论指出：狼就是披上羊皮，也没有人把它当羊看待。所以，尽管美帝国主义强迫扣留战俘的凶恶政策披上了印度提案的外衣，它也是欺骗不了任何人的。此次蜂岩岛的屠杀惨案已更加清楚地揭露了美帝国主义的早已被粉碎的所谓“自愿遣返”的阴谋的真相。美帝国主义者的这种暴行，只能进一步激起全世界所有善良人民的愤恨。
