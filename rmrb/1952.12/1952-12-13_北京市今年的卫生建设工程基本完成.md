Beijing has basically completed this year's sanitary construction projects.
This year, according to the capital's urban construction policy and the needs of the masses, Beijing carried out sanitary engineering construction in coordination with the Patriotic Health Campaign. The scale of the projects is larger than in any previous year. In terms of sewers, 57 kilometers have been newly built, exceeding the total length of sewers built in the past two years. In terms of dredging rivers and lakes, 1.13 million cubic meters of earth have been excavated. So far, the sanitary projects planned for this year have been basically completed.

At the end of March and the beginning of April this year, in order to reduce the breeding of mosquitoes and flies, the city first carried out the work of eliminating standing water and filling in sewage pits. In early June, large-scale sanitary engineering construction began, such as dredging the lotus marshes in Taoranting and Longtan, and converting open ditches into covered ditches in Sipingyuan, Tongfasi, Liguangqiao, and Chengguanxiang.

Among the sanitary projects carried out this year, the pipe trenches for the new sewers in the western suburbs' new urban area are more than 7,000 meters long, and 520,000 cubic meters of earth were excavated from Longtan. The new sewers in the eastern suburbs' industrial area have more than 1,100 meters built with bricks and 750 meters built with cement pipes (with a diameter of 3.2 meters). In the southern part of the original Eighth District outside Xuanwu Gate, open ditches were converted into covered ditches, of which more than 3,000 meters of covered ditches were built with bricks and more than 2,100 meters of covered ditches were built with cement pipes (with a diameter of about 2.6 meters). This is a huge project, and organizational and educational work must be carried out for the workers during the project to ensure its smooth progress. To this end, a patriotic production increase and economy campaign was launched among more than 10,000 employees in July this year, and the workers actively used their brains to find shortcuts. After learning from advanced Soviet experience, the workers in the South Suburb Work Zone of the former Eighth District used the "template bricklaying method," averaging more than 2,700 bricks laid per worker. The working comrades in the technical section of the Sanitary Engineering Bureau also learned from advanced Soviet experience, changed the composition of the mortar, and saved the country more than 600 million yuan. The drainage ditch construction project at Xizhaosi in Chongwen District and the reed pond dredging project at Zikeng in Fengtai District both exceeded the original savings plan.

In order to do a good job in next year's sanitary construction projects, the Beijing Municipal Sanitary Engineering Bureau is now actively organizing relevant personnel to learn Russian, and is selecting engineers, construction section chiefs and other cadres to go to Tanggu New Port, Shanghai, Qingdao, Shenyang, Harbin and other places to learn advanced work experience. At the same time, it has also selected cadres and workers to carry out assessment work.

    北京市今年的卫生建设工程基本完成
    今年，北京市根据首都市政建设方针和群众的需要，配合爱国卫生运动进行了卫生工程的建设，其规模之大，超过了过去的任何一年。在下水道方面，新建五十七公里，超过了过去两年中所修建的下水道的总和；在疏挖河湖方面，挖出的土达一百一十三万土方。到目前为止，今年计划修建的卫生工程，基本上已经完成。
    今年三月底、四月初，为了减少蚊蝇的繁殖，全市首先进行了排除积水、填平污水坑的工作。六月初，开始了大规模的卫生工程建设，如疏浚陶然亭苇塘、龙潭，把四平园、铜法寺、李广桥以及城关厢等处的明沟改成暗沟。
    在今年进行的卫生工程中，西郊新市区新建下水道的管沟长达七千多公尺，龙潭挖出五十二万土方；东郊工业区新建的下水道，有一千一百多公尺是用砖修的，七百五十公尺是用水泥管修的（管的直径达三米二）；宣武门外原第八区南部把明沟改成暗沟，其中三千多公尺的暗沟是用砖修的，二千一百多公尺的暗沟是用水泥管修的（管的直径约二米六）。这是一项浩大的工程，在工程进行中必须对工人进行组织工作和教育工作，才能保证工程的顺利进行。为此，今年七月间在万余职工中展开了爱国增产节约运动，工人们则积极开动脑筋，寻找窍门。原第八区南郊工区的工人，在学习苏联先进经验以后，运用了“模板砌砖法”，平均每工砌砖数达到二千七百多块；卫生工程局技术室的工作同志也学习了苏联的先进经验，改变沙浆的成分，给国家节约了六亿多元的财富。崇文区夕照寺的排水沟修建工程和丰台区渣子坑疏浚苇塘的工程，都超过了原订的节约计划。
    北京市卫生工程局为了做好明年的卫生建设工程，现正积极组织有关人员学习俄文；并选派工程师、工务科长等干部，前往塘沽新港、上海、青岛、沈阳、哈尔滨等地学习先进的工作经验。同时又选派干部和工人实行查定工作。
