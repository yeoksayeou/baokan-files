    Weifang City Should Continue to Strengthen Worker Education

    Comrade Editor: After the factories and mines in Weifang City, Shandong Province, conducted education on communism and the Communist Party for their employees, the employees' class consciousness and production enthusiasm were greatly improved, breaking the purely technical viewpoints and technological conservatism among the employees.

    In the past, Li Ke Gong, a seventh-grade fitter with more than 20 years of experience at the Dahua Agricultural Implements Factory, was unwilling to attend any factory meetings. He believed that he possessed a set of skills that would get him by anywhere. Now, he also actively participates in meetings, takes the initiative to help others, and has applied to join the Party. The technical personnel of the Xinxing Textile Mill were previously ideologically conservative and unwilling to teach apprentices. Now, they are actively signing apprenticeship contracts with apprentices. Some workers in the Fangzi Coal Mine previously lacked confidence in promoting advanced experience and excessively emphasized difficulties; now they have also changed. Furthermore, employees of Dahua Machinery Factory and Jinxing Foundry have made many achievements in improving production methods and increasing work efficiency.

    However, some ideological concerns still exist among some workers. For example, when promoting Liu Linfu's advanced experience at the Dahua Agricultural Implements Factory, some workers still only emphasized difficulties. When workers at the Xinxing Textile Mill discussed the "1951 Weaving Method," they all thought this method was very good, but feared that the labor force would be surplus and workers would lose their jobs after using this method, so they did not dare to promote it.

    I believe that these issues are very important. I hope that the factories and mines in Weifang City will continue to strengthen education for their employees so that advanced experiences can be smoothly implemented.

    潍坊市应继续加强工人教育
    编辑同志：山东潍坊市各厂矿对职工进行了共产主义和共产党的教育后，大大提高了职工的阶级觉悟和生产热情，打破职工中的单纯技术观点和技术保守思想。
    过去，该市大华农具厂二十多年工龄的七级钳工李克功，不愿意参加厂里的任何会议，他认为自己有
    一套技术，到什么地方也难不着。现在他也积极参加会议，主动帮助别人，并要求入党。新兴染织厂的技术人员，过去思想保守，不愿教徒弟。现在积极地和徒弟签订师徒合同。坊子煤矿有些工人，过去对推广先进经验缺乏信心，过分强调困难，现在也改变了。其他，如大华机器厂、晋兴翻砂厂的职工，对改进生产方法，提高工作效率都做出很多成绩。
    但是，在某些工人中，还存在着一些思想顾虑。如大华农具厂在推广刘林福先进经验时，有些工人还只知强调困难，新兴染织厂工人讨论“一九五一织布工作法”时，都认为这个工作法很好，但怕运用了这个方法后，劳动力剩余，工人失业，所以又不敢推广。
    我认为这些问题很重要，希望潍坊市各厂矿对职工继续加强教育，使先进经验顺利推行。
