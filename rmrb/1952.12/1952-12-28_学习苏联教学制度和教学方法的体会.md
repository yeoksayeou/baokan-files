    Experiences in Learning from the Soviet Teaching System and Methods
    Acting Deputy Director of the Architectural Mechanics Teaching and Research Office, Harbin Institute of Technology, Wang Guangyuan
    Learning from the Soviet teaching experience is of great significance for the reform of higher education in our country. Experience tells us that the Soviet teaching system and teaching methods possess unparalleled superiority. Based on my experience in teaching at the Harbin Institute of Technology, I believe its superiority lies in the following points:
    First, the Soviet teaching system is permeated with strict organization. In the past, universities in old China generally implemented a set of Anglo-American bourgeois teaching systems. Under this teaching system, the relationship between teachers and students often manifested as a transaction of "knowledge." As soon as the class bell rang, teachers went home. Their own lives were not to be questioned by students, and their teaching methods and content were not allowed to be criticized. In their view, the students' learning life seemed to be unrelated to them. Although this situation has changed greatly since liberation, there are still many problems.
    Under the Soviet teaching system, teachers are strictly organized. Teachers' political study and daily life are led and managed by the trade union and school administration, while professional matters are the responsibility of the teaching and research office. Teachers should strictly abide by the instructions and decisions of the teaching and research office, closely care about and participate in the various tasks of the teaching and research office. The teaching and research office is responsible for helping teachers improve teaching methods, inspecting the implementation of teaching plans, improving teachers' professional level, and assigning teachers' work. Therefore, not only should teachers frequently report their work at the teaching and research office meetings, but also the director of the teaching and research office should frequently conduct classroom inspections in order to more specifically and deeply understand the work of each teacher and provide feedback to the teachers. Under the leadership of the director of the teaching and research office, the members of the teaching and research office should frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism. The scope of this criticism is very broad. The criticism involves not only teaching issues but also even lifestyle issues (for example, teachers are not allowed to dress sloppily or behave strangely), because a teacher's every move has a great impact on students.
    Second, the Soviet teaching system is permeated with meticulous planning. In the past, everything in our universities lacked planning, and naturally, teaching work was no exception. The teaching content of teachers often followed their whims, rambling all over the place. They would talk endlessly about what they were familiar with but avoid what they did not understand. After the semester was over, the students received their credits, and the teachers were considered to have completed their tasks, but no one cared about how much progress was made or what the results were. Taking myself as an example, none of the courses I took in my four years at university in the past were completed; some were only a quarter finished. At that time, there was also another bad phenomenon, namely, if the teacher forgot to assign homework, the students had nothing to do. Once the teacher remembered, dozens of questions would be assigned, overwhelming the students and making them not know where to start. Some students simply did not do it.
    In contrast, Soviet teaching is meticulously planned. At the beginning of the semester, teachers first draw up their teaching calendars in detail. Not only do they have to detail the weekly teaching content according to the teaching syllabus, but also the dates for issuing and collecting homework and assignments, as well as the timing of inspections and examinations. At the same time, the teaching and research office, based on the situation of the semester, and after full research by all members, formulates the work plan for the semester, including the teaching plan, the plan for organizing self-study, the scientific research plan, the plan for cultivating teachers and graduate students, and the plan for other work, etc. Then the department makes appropriate allocations and arrangements for students' study time and examinations, etc., according to the plans of the teaching and research offices. The implementation of the plan is also frequently checked during the process. This ensures the smooth progress of teaching work.
    Third, ensuring that students are taught well is the central task of teaching organizations and teaching staff. In our universities in the past, the task of a general teacher was only to teach and lecture. As for whether students understood or not, that was unrelated to the teacher. This teaching method was like throwing students into the water and letting them learn to swim by themselves. The result could be one of three: the students drown, the students give up learning halfway due to difficulties, or the students learn to swim. But how much more time and how much more hardship would it take to achieve the last result!
    The Soviet teaching method is exactly the opposite. It uses every means to ensure that students are taught well and grow up healthily. For example, organizing multiple production internships, formulating systematic and detailed homework and course designs, etc., the purpose of which is to enable students to connect what they have learned with reality and solve current practical problems.
    Before the beginning of each class, the teacher makes full preparations and writes detailed lecture notes. The teacher does this not because he is not familiar with the content of the lecture, but in order to carefully consider how to spend the least amount of time to make the students understand most clearly. Taking the dozens of Soviet experts at our school as an example, they all have decades or even decades of teaching experience, and they are naturally very familiar with the course content. However, they all make full preparations before each class. Every small example, even every sentence, is carefully considered. In the past, bourgeois professors said: "It is not necessary to explain too clearly. If it is explained too clearly, it becomes spoon-feeding." This is just an irresponsible person making excuses for himself.
    When students have difficulties, the teaching and research office conducts research and assists in solving them. Our school has absorbed this Soviet experience and helped students solve many difficulties. For example, students were initially not used to doing homework, often making mistakes and having to rework, and the time spent on one homework assignment was often as long as forty or fifty hours. The teaching and research office understood this situation and convened senior class students, class representatives, and all relevant teachers to study and discuss the reasons for rework and the mistakes that are prone to occur in calculations and drafting, and determined ways to overcome the mistakes. This greatly improved students' work efficiency, enabling them to complete an assignment in thirteen to twenty hours.
    In addition, according to the Soviet teaching system, if a teacher is sick, the teaching and research office immediately finds someone to substitute. Absences are absolutely not allowed.
    If students have questions, they can ask them in the exercise class or go to the Q&A room during the specified Q&A time. If a general problem is discovered, "collective Q&A" is organized to ensure that students thoroughly understand all the problems.
    Ensuring that students are taught well does not mean arranging everything for the students and letting them passively accept knowledge without using their brains. On the contrary, the Soviet teaching system pays the most attention to cultivating students' ability to think and study independently. For example, organizing students to conduct scientific research, discuss specialized issues, and engage in research on homework and course design, etc.
    Fourth, the superiority of the Soviet examination system. In our universities in the past, examinations were for teachers to give students grades and for students to pass. But the spirit of the Soviet examination system is not like this. Examinations are an integral part of the entire learning process. The purpose is not only to check students' grades and improve their understanding of the course but also to check the work of teachers.
    Therefore, the purpose of mid-term checks, tests, and pre-exam tests is to give students the opportunity to review what they have learned and to urge students to complete their exercises and assignments in a timely manner. If problems are found in teaching, attempts are made to solve them in order to improve teaching quality.
    During the examination, teachers ask students questions from all aspects around a central issue. If the student cannot answer, the teacher tries to enlighten him, so that he first understands the content of the question, and then explains it to him in detail. If necessary, books can be assigned for him to read after the examination, so as to make the student thoroughly understand these questions. If it is found that a student's grades are not as good as in the past, the teacher must understand the reasons for his grade deterioration and tell him the direction of his efforts. If a student passes the exam, but he is not satisfied with his grade, the teacher can allow him to take the exam again after a period of time. During this period, if the student has made progress, the score can be raised. In short, teachers must try everything possible to improve students' ability to understand the course.
    Fifth, in the process of learning science and technology, constantly improve students' political understanding. In Soviet schools, teachers not only want students to learn science and technology well, but also to understand politics. This is fully reflected in Soviet textbooks. For example, in structural mechanics, when narrating the development process of structural mechanics, it fully explains the interrelationship of all things. For example, the productivity and production knowledge of ancient times determined the architectural forms of that time. The disintegration of feudal society in the Galileo era, the gradual prosperity of commercial capital and overseas trade, and the development of the metallurgical industry, put forward the requirements for the development of materials mechanics and created conditions for the development of materials mechanics. The rapid development of capitalism in the nineteenth century and the large-scale manufacture of rolled steel materials laid the social and material foundation for the truss theory. The application of reinforced concrete in the late nineteenth century changed the form of the structure, and the steel frame theory came into being. In the twentieth century, due to the larger-scale development of machinery, the loads borne by the structure became more complicated, and the scale of the structure became larger and larger, so the accelerated development of structural dynamics and structural stability theory became necessary.
    The great October Revolution opened up broad avenues for the development of science and technology in the Soviet Union. The same is true in technical theory. For example, due to the strengthening of the overall concept, a new method of designing and calculating structures according to the overall bearing capacity of the structure has emerged. Although this new scientific theory is still in its infancy, it will replace the old method of designing and calculating according to capital stress in a large range. The establishment of other new strength theories such as Davidenkov-Friedman is also closely related to certain political ideas. Society needs to accumulate funds and save wealth, and this task puts forward a new proposition for scientists - to calculate stress more accurately and avoid unnecessary waste. Soviet scientists have made great achievements in this regard.
    Soviet scientists oppose the separation of theory and practice. For example, in the book Materials Mechanics, the author always emphasizes that it is not allowed to regard this science as a simple theoretical calculation, and all its problems can only be solved after studying real materials. At the same time, it is explained that theory is generated from practice, which is verified by experiments on the one hand, and guides the conduct of experiments on the other hand. The author points out that there was a period when materials mechanics was to a considerable extent separated from reality, resulting in a phenomenon in which the results of research were separated from practical application. Such a theory naturally cannot solve any problems. The author warns the reader with this.
    Soviet textbooks also have a feature that they often explain that the courses students learn are closely related to national economic construction. For example, when materials mechanics talks about the selection of capital stress, it explains that incorrect selection will cause great waste of people's property or damage the structural strength. This naturally stimulates students' patriotic enthusiasm and promotes their learning.
    The above is my experience in learning from the Soviet teaching system and teaching methods.

    学习苏联教学制度和教学方法的体会
    哈尔滨工业大学建筑力学教学研究室代理副主任　王光远
    学习苏联的教学经验，对于我国高等教育的改革有着重大的意义。经验告诉我们，苏联的教学制度和教学方法，具有无比的优越性。根据我在哈尔滨工业大学教学中的体会，我认为它的优越性有下列几点：
    第一、苏联教学制度贯穿着严密的组织性。旧中国的大学普遍实施美英资产阶级的一套教学制度。在这种教学制度底下，师生之间往往表现为买卖“知识”的关系。下课铃一响，教师各自回家了。他们自己的生活既不容同学过问，其教学方法及教学内容也不允许指责。在他们看来，学生们的学习生活好像是和他无关的。这种情况虽在解放以后有了很大的改变，但是，问题仍然不少。
    在苏联的教学制度下，教师们是被严密地组织起来的。教师的政治学习和日常生活，由工会及学校行政方面来领导、管理，业务则由教研室负责。教员应该严格遵守教研室的指示及决定，密切关心并参预教研室的各项工作。教研室负有帮助教员改进教学方法、检查教学计划的执行情况、提高教师的业务水平、分配教师的工作等责任。因此，不仅教师应经常在教研室会议上报告自己的工作情况，而且教研室主任应经常进行课堂巡视，以便更具体、深入地了解各个教师的工作情况，并向教员提出意见。在教研室主任的领导下，教研室的成员应经常展开批评和自我批评。这种批评的范围是很广泛的。批评所涉及的，不仅有教学方面的问题，甚至还有生活上的问题（例如不允许教师衣着不整洁或行为怪诞）。因为教师的一举一动都会在学生中产生很大的影响。
    第二、苏联教学制度贯穿着周密的计划性。以前我国各大学的一切都是缺乏计划的，教学工作自然也不会例外。教师的教学内容，往往随自己兴之所至，天南地北乱扯一通。自己熟习的地方，讲个不休，自己不懂的则避而不谈。学期一完，学生拿到了学分，教员算是完成了任务，至于功课进行了多少，成绩如何，是无人过问的。就拿我个人来说，我过去在大学四年中所学的功课，没有一门是学完了的；有的甚至只学了四分之一。那时，还有另外一种坏现象，即如果教员忘记了指定习题，学生便无事可作。一旦教员想起了这回事，题目一出就是好几十个，累得同学晕头转向，不知所从。有的学生索性就不作了。
    与此相反，苏联的教学是有周密的计划性的。学期之始，教员首先详细订出自己的教学日历。他不仅要根据教学大纲详细订出每周的教课内容，而且要订出习题及家庭作业发出和收回的日期以及检查、考试的时间等。同时教研室根据本学期的情况，经过全体成员的充分研究，订出本学期的工作计划，其中包括教学计划、组织自学计划、科学研究计划、培养师资及研究生的计划以及其他工作的计划等等。然后系里根据各教研室的计划把学生的学习时间及考试等作适当的分配和安排。在进行中又经常地检查计划执行的情况。这样便保证了教学工作的顺利进行。
    第三、保证教好学生是教学组织及教学人员的中心任务。以前在我们的大学里，一般教员的任务只是上课讲书。至于学生懂不懂、会不会，那是和教员无关的。这种教学法就好像是把学生抛在水里，让他自己去学游泳。其结果可能有三个：一是学生被溺死，一是学生中途知难而退、放弃学习，一是学生学会游泳。而要得到最后一个结果，该是需要多花多少时间，多喝多少苦水啊！
    苏联的教学方法和这恰恰相反，用一切办法保证把学生教好，使他们健康地成长起来。例如组织多次的生产实习，制定系统而详细的家庭作业和课程设计等等，其目的都是为了使学生能把学到的东西和实际联系起来，并解决当前的实际问题。
    每一堂课开始以前，教员都进行充分的准备，写好详细的讲稿。教员这样作倒不是因为对所讲内容不熟习，而是为了能仔细考虑，怎样花费最少的时间使同学得到最清楚的了解。就拿我校数十位苏联专家来说吧，他们都有十几年、甚至几十年的教学经验，对课程内容自然是滚瓜烂熟。然而他们每上一堂课都是经过充分准备的。每一个小的例题，甚至每一句话都是经过仔细推敲的。过去，资产阶级的教授们说：“不必讲得太清楚。如果讲得太清楚了，便成了灌输式的教学。”这不过是不负责任的人在替自己解嘲而已。
    学生们有了困难，教研室就进行研究，并予以协助解决。我们学校就吸收了苏联的这一经验，帮助学生解决了不少困难。例如，同学们最初不习惯于作家庭作业，时常出错返工，而在一个家庭作业上所花费的时间往往达四、五十小时之多。教研室了解了这个情况，便召集高级班同学、课代表以及所有有关教师，研究、讨论了返工和在演算、制图中容易发生错误的原因，并定出了克服错误的办法。这样就大大提高了学生们的工作效率，使他们在十三到二十小时内即可完成一个作业。
    另外，按照苏联的教学制度，假如教员病了，教研室马上找人代课。决不允许缺课。
    学生有了问题，可以在习题课上问，也可在规定的答疑时间内到答疑室去问。如发现带有普遍性的问题，便组织“集体答疑”，务使学生对所有问题澈底了解。
    保证把学生教好，并不等于一切都给学生安排好，让他们不动脑筋地、被动地接受知识。恰巧相反，苏联的教学制度最注重培养学生独立思考、独立钻研的能力。例如组织学生进行科学研究，讨论专门问题，从事家庭作业及课程设计的研究，等等。
    第四、苏联考试制度的优越性。以前在我们的大学里，考试对教员来说是给学生打分数，对学生来说是过关。而苏联考试制度的精神不是如此。考试是整个学习过程中不可分割的一部分。其目的不仅是为了检查学生的成绩，提高他们对课程的理解，而且是为了检查教师的工作。
    因此，学期中间的检查、测验和考试以前的测验，目的在于使学生对所学的东西获得复习的机会，并督促学生及时做完习题和作业。如果在教学方面发现问题，便设法解决，以提高教学质量。
    考试时教师围绕着一个中心问题从各个方面对同学提出问题。如果学生回答不出，教师就设法启发他，使他先了解这个问题的内容，然后才详细地给他解释。必要时还可以指定书籍让他在考试后阅读，务使学生对这些问题澈底了解。如发现某一学生的成绩比不上过去好，教员就得了解他成绩变坏的原因，并告诉他努力的方向。如学生虽考试及格，但他对自己所得成绩并不满意，教师可以允许他经过一段时间再来考试。在此期间，如果这个学生确有进步，分数是可以提升的。总之，教师要想尽一切办法，提高学生对课程的理解能力。
    第五、在科学技术的学习过程中，不断提高学生的政治认识。在苏联的学校里，教师不仅要学生学好科学技术，而且还要使他懂得政治。这一点在苏联的教材里被充分地反映了出来。例如结构力学，在叙说结构力学的发展过程时，就充分说明了一切事物发展的相互联系。比如古代的生产力及生产知识决定了当时的建筑形式。迦利略时代封建社会的解体，商业资本及海外贸易的逐渐繁荣，以及冶金业的发展，提出了发展材料力学的要求，并为材料力学的发展创造了条件。十九世纪资本主义的迅速发展和辗钢器材的大量制造，奠定了桁架理论的社会基础和物质基础。十九世纪后期钢筋混凝土的应用，改变了结构的形式，钢架理论乃应运而生。二十世纪由于机械更大规模的发展，结构所承受的荷重更为复杂，同时结构的规模也愈来愈大，因而结构动力学及结构稳定理论的加速发展便成为必需的了。
    伟大的十月革命，为苏联科学技术的发展开辟了广阔的道路。在技术理论方面，同样如此。例如由于整体观念的加强，产生了按结构整体承载能力去设计和计算结构的新方法。虽然这种新的科学理论尚在幼年期间，但它将在很大的范围内代替旧的按资用应力的设计和计算方法。其他如达维金考夫——福瑞得曼新的强度理论等等的创立，也无不与一定的政治思想发生密切的关系。社会需要积累资金，节约财富，这一任务给科学家们提出了新的命题——要更进一步精确地计算应力，避免不必要的浪费。苏联科学家在这方面已有了很大的成就。
    苏联的科学家反对理论和实际脱节。比如在材料力学这本书中，作者总是强调指出不允许把这门科学当作单纯的理论运算，它的一切问题只有在对真实的材料加以研究之后，才能解决。同时说明理论是从实践中产生的，它一方面由实验来验证，同时又反过来指导实验的进行。作者指出有一个时期材料力学在相当的程度上脱离了实际，因而造成了研究的结果和实际应用相脱节的现象。这样的理论自然不能解决任何问题。作者以此警惕读者。
    苏联的教材还有一个特点，它经常说明学生所学的功课是和国家经济建设有着密切的关系。例如材料力学讲到资用应力的选择时，便说明不正确的选择会给人民财产造成很大的浪费，或者使结构强度受到损失。这样自然就激发了学生的爱国主义的热情，推动了他们的学习。
    以上就是我在学习苏联教学制度和教学方法中的体会。
