    Reforming and Developing National Opera Art
    ——Concluding Report at the First National Opera Observation and Emulation Festival on November 14, 1952
    Zhou Yang
    The Main Significance of Observational Performances Lies in Learning
    This observational performance included twenty-three opera genres popular among the masses from all over the country, performing nearly one hundred different repertoires in their respective styles. It was the first time in the history of Chinese opera that such a large-scale exhibition of national opera was held. From this performance, we can clearly see: our national opera heritage is so rich that we must re-recognize it, learn from it, and develop it on a new basis. Before us is a true ocean of art. Although various operas across the country have had obvious mutual influences in their historical development, they have, on the whole, long been in a state of mutual isolation, even isolationism. This state is now beginning to be broken. A new relationship is beginning to be established among various operas across the country: a relationship of mutual absorption and mutual development in a friendly and free competition. Comrade Mao Zedong's guideline of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" most correctly stipulates this mutual relationship between various operas and their common goal of struggle. This performance provides an excellent opportunity for mutual learning and observation among various genres, and it will surely play a huge role in promoting the future development of opera nationwide.
    This performance not only concentrated on exhibiting the excellent heritage of national opera over the centuries, but also demonstrated the new achievements of opera reform under the people's regime. The performance awarded prizes to outstanding repertoires and performances. The purpose of the awards is mainly to encourage the reform of opera art. The awards indicate what we want to promote and what we want to oppose. We oppose conservatism and also oppose crude reforms. We advocate correct reforms. We advocate reforming and developing national opera art according to the needs of the people, resolutely discarding all reactionary, poisonous, and unfavorable parts of the opera heritage, while preserving and promoting all progressive, healthy, and beneficial parts for the people. We should respect and cherish our own national traditions, and we should not arbitrarily discard or destroy them. We encourage excellent techniques in artistic creation, because those techniques are the result of countless efforts made by artists in long-term arduous labor to truthfully represent life, but we do not approve of formalism, affectedness, and lifeless so-called "techniques."
    Learning from the excellent heritage, learning from excellent techniques, and learning from the correct experience of opera reform are the main significance and tasks of this observational performance.
    Any genre that is good at learning, good at absorbing the strengths of others, and brave in improving and creating will have unlimited prospects; conversely, any genre that is complacent, sticks to conventions, and thus cannot adapt to the new needs of the people will encounter failure in the course of historical evolution.
    Since the main significance of the observational performance lies in learning, the purpose of the awards is mainly to promote mutual learning. Because this award is limited to the programs and artists participating in the performance, many excellent scripts and excellent actors who should have won awards did not have the opportunity to be evaluated. However, this performance is a great encouragement to opera workers across the country, regardless of whether they participated or won awards. Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and many responsible comrades of the Central Committee are very concerned about this performance. They watched the performances of various genres participating in the performance, which is a more valuable encouragement to us than anything else. This shows the earnest expectations of the Party, the government, and the people for us.
    This performance was a success. Competitive performances are undoubtedly a good way to promote the development of opera art. In the future, we will hold such performances every few years. However, due to our lack of experience in holding performances and insufficient prior preparation, there are inevitably many shortcomings in this performance. For example, some important genres and excellent artists in the country have not been invited to participate, or although they participated, they did not get appropriate or sufficient performance opportunities, so the awards could not be made very carefully and appropriately. The selection and arrangement of programs also have some imperfections. The fact that this performance still achieved great success despite these shortcomings is mainly due to the efforts of all the comrades participating in the performance.
    Serving the Country and the People Better is the Most Glorious Task of Opera Workers
    The success of this opera performance and the attention paid to it by the people and the country do not give us any reason to be complacent in the slightest. On the contrary, it greatly increases the responsibility of each of our opera workers to the country and the people. Since opera is such an art that connects millions of people, how should it cooperate with the large-scale economic construction and cultural construction that our country is beginning to undertake, and exert its greater power to educate the people and transform society? It should help the country correctly educate the people, educate the people with patriotic, democratic, and socialist ideas, spread the new social atmosphere, improve the people's moral qualities, and enrich the people's spiritual life. If it cannot do this, it will not have its glorious place in the new people's life.
    Since the founding of New China, opera workers across the country have made many efforts to reform opera art to suit the needs of the country and the people. The work of opera reform has achieved results; this can be seen from some of the excellent programs and performances in this performance. It is particularly worth pointing out that, over the past three years, the vast number of opera artists have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and patriotism in opera reform and various social and political activities, and have shown sincere and heartfelt support for the Communist Party and the People's Government. This sentiment of opera artists is completely understandable. Because in the old society under reactionary rule, they were subjected to persecution and insult for a long time, and their art was despised and trampled upon. The theatrical careers of many artists were full of blood and tears. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution brought, first of all, the liberation of the artists themselves. Their status in the new country is no longer one of being insulted, but one of being respected; their art is no longer being despised and trampled upon, but being valued and cherished. The progress shown by the vast number of opera artists in all aspects shows in practical actions that they have not failed the country and the people's attention and expectations for them.
    However, it is undeniable that opera artists still face many difficulties. Since opera was created by the people in the old society, many parts of it inevitably carry some feudal dross, and more importantly, the new life of the people requires new opera. Therefore, in order to make opera better and completely suitable for the needs of the new society, there must be correct reform and more creation. The vast number of opera artists were mostly deprived of the right to education in the old society. Many of them lack the necessary cultural knowledge and artistic cultivation, and at the same time, they have more or less contracted some old ideas and old habits of the old society. In order to transform and improve themselves, and to become new people's artists with new ideas and styles, with cultural and artistic cultivation, opera artists still need to make many major efforts.
    The responsibility of the Party and the government mainly lies in helping opera artists overcome old ideas and old styles and establish new ideas and new styles; helping artists improve politically, culturally, and artistically; enabling them to understand the basic situation and policies of the country; enabling them to approach the lives of the people, understand the needs of the people, and enable them to carry out opera reform in close cooperation with new literary and art workers. Many cultural work cadres of the Party and government in various places have adopted the correct attitude towards artists and opera reform work, but many cadres have adopted wrong and crude attitudes. These cadres do not establish a close, comradely cooperative relationship with artists in opera reform work, but adopt a condescending bureaucratic attitude towards them. They do not respect the artists' techniques, but despise those techniques, believing that they are all "backward" and "should be eliminated." As for the artists, they only see the bad influences left on them by the old society, but do not see their progress, do not see that they are trying their best to get rid of those bad influences. In opera reform work, they do not mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the artists, rely on the artists to carry out the reform, but self-righteously rely on their own "skills" to do things alone, ignoring the artists. Some cadres even treat artists like the old feudal rulers treated artists. All these wrong attitudes of theirs are related to their contempt for national art heritage, contempt for people's traditions, and contempt for the people's preferences. If these wrong attitudes are not overcome, we will not be able to guide the vast number of opera art workers to serve the country and the people better.
    Correctly Promoting the Excellent Traditions of National Opera Art, Opposing Conservative Ideas and Crude Styles
    China's opera heritage not only has a long history and rich content, but has always maintained a close spiritual connection with the vast number of people and is loved by the people. Many of these opera heritages were created by the working people or people's writers and artists of past dynasties, and thus have a strong spirit of the people and realism. Although these heritages have been wantonly used and distorted by the feudal rulers, opera is, after all, a more mass-based and democratic art form. Its dissemination mainly depends on the support and love of the vast audience, and the people's preferences cannot be forced by any ruler. The people observe the surrounding reality with their own eyes, and at the same time, based on their own life experience, add their own imagination and judgment to the stories of history and legends, and create the characters they yearn for and love in various operas. The people's love and hatred are clear. Contrary to the will of the feudal rulers, the people's true sympathy is always on the side of the oppressed and the bullied, on the side of those who are weak and kind, and they express deep anger and contempt for those vicious oppressors and exploiters who ride on the heads of the people. They sing praises of those heroes and righteous people who dare to resist oppression, resist violence, and fight for their own survival and happiness. They love those who are selfless and brave, and hate those who are timid, selfish, and unscrupulous. The people are full of patriotism. They sing praises of national heroes who defend the motherland, and hate national scum who betray the motherland. That is why the people sing praises of Yue Fei, the Yang family generals, and Xue Rengui in opera, and oppose people like Qin Hui, Pan Hong, and Zhang Shigui (here, whether the real Pan Hong and Zhang Shigui were bad people is not important); why they sing praises of the heroes of Liangshanbo, and oppose people like Gao Qiu and Ximen Qing; why they sympathize with the White Snake and the Green Snake, and hate Fahai. It can be clearly seen that although Chinese opera is mixed with a lot of feudal dross, its people's nature and the brilliance of realism are always indelible.
    Chinese opera is loved by the masses precisely because it expresses the lives of the people, expresses the thoughts, feelings, psychology, will, and aspirations of the people, and its expression form has the style of the people. From Chinese opera, we not only feel the powerful force of realism, but also feel the powerful force of people's morality. Opera reflects the character of the Chinese nation, and in turn, plays a certain role in the development process of national character and national psychology. The heroic figures created in opera have influenced the Chinese people for generations. When we talk about the positive influence of opera on our national character, we must also see the negative influence in it that cannot represent our national character. Opera reflects the people's will and desire to pursue freedom under the feudal system, and expresses the people's courage, diligence, wisdom, and kindness; but on the other hand, we must not forget that the feudal rulers also tried their best to use opera to cultivate the people's passive and submissive character, and tried their best to make all the excellent qualities of the people serve the interests of maintaining and consolidating feudal rule. The people are diligent, and the feudal rulers use this diligence to let the people drive him like cattle and horses; the people are brave, and the feudal rulers use this bravery to let the people protect his rule at the risk of their lives. In opera, the people's nature often stretches stubbornly and tortuously like grass pressed under a stone, and the people's nature and feudal elements are often intertwined in a complex way. Many operas expose the irreconcilable contradiction between the people and the feudal system, but cannot find a correct way to solve this contradiction, so they reconcile the contradiction by the road of compromise. "Butterfly Cup" is like this. This is a very dramatic opera. Its first half is full of righteous resistance to evil forces and warm sympathy for the working people, but in the second half, in a cleverly arranged love entanglement, enemies become relatives, and struggle becomes reconciliation. The revisions of the scripts of the Jin opera "Butterfly Cup" and the Qin opera "Touring Turtle Mountain" (that is, its first half) in this performance, although not perfect, are necessary and beneficial work.
    "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and "The Legend of the White Snake" are particularly outstanding in Chinese opera. They are truly masterpieces of the people. The scripts and performances of the Yue opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," the Sichuan opera "Liuyin Ji" (another name for "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai"), and the Beijing opera and Yue opera "The Legend of the White Snake" in this performance have achieved success to varying degrees. These two scripts strongly express the Chinese people's, especially women's, unconquerable will to pursue freedom and happiness, as well as their brave spirit of self-sacrifice. They dare to resist the violent oppressors who are far beyond their strength, without any wavering or compromise; they are unyielding until death; it can be said that their love triumphs over death. Of course, their victory is only achieved in the form of fantasy. How can a pair of lovers turn into butterflies flying wing to wing after death, and how can a person who is pressed under the Leifeng Pagoda be resurrected? This is fantasy, but it is also reality, because it most truly expresses the people's irrepressible desire for freedom. Isn't it this fantasy that has inspired generations of people to fight unyieldingly to break free from the shackles of the feudal marriage system? Didn't the Leifeng Pagoda finally collapse? Lu Xun once praised the collapse of this symbolic Leifeng Pagoda with highly enthusiastic words.
    Here, I would like to take the opportunity to explain the difference between myths and legends produced by fantasy and superstitious stories. Whether it is myth or superstition, it originally reflects the ancient people's naive understanding of the world, a belief in supernatural forces; but the meanings of the two are different. Because not everything involving supernatural forces is superstition that should be discarded; many myths often take a positive attitude towards the world and are often rich in people's nature; while superstition is always negative and often reflects the interests of the ruling class. This difference is most prominently manifested in the attitude towards fate. Myths often show that people are unwilling to succumb to fate and conquer fate in a fantasy form. Conversely, superstition is precisely to promote fatalism, promote karma, and make people believe that everything is predetermined by fate and they can only bow their heads in the face of fate. Due to the different views on fate, different attitudes are taken towards the gods who are the masters of fate. Myths often dare to resist the authority of the gods, such as Sun Wukong's resistance to the Jade Emperor and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's resistance to the Queen Mother; superstition is to promote people's powerlessness towards the gods, and they must be slaves and sacrifices to the gods. Therefore, myths often encourage people to strive to get rid of their enslaved status and pursue a true human life, while superstition makes people willingly accept being slaves and beautifies the chains of slaves. The reason why we oppose superstition but praise myths is here.
    It can be seen that the realism in Chinese opera has its unique features. It not only truly reflects the cruel reality of feudal society, but also enthusiastically expresses the ideals, hopes, and confidence for a better life in the future; here, realism and romanticism have achieved a harmonious combination. The unique concise and exaggerated techniques of Chinese opera make this combination reach a height of art. We see this feature not only in large tragedies like "The Legend of the White Snake" and "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," but also in small comedies like the Sichuan opera "Autumn River," "Judging Traces by Snow," and the Chu opera "Ge Ma." Those comedies wonderfully combine the people's wit, humor, and enthusiasm.
    It is not accidental that Chinese opera has reached a considerable height of realism. Chinese opera has a history of nearly seven hundred years from its golden age—the Yuan Dynasty—to the present. In the process of several hundred years of development, it has been continuously supplemented, revised, and enriched by the creation of the people. The existing operas in China are all developed from folk operas. Although Beijing opera has entered the court, its foundation is still folk, and it has always maintained contact with the people. As everyone knows, when Beijing opera began to form and develop in the middle of the Qing Dynasty, it integrated several relatively outstanding local operas at the time, such as Erhuang and Qinqiang, and absorbed the essence of Kunqu; it was closer to the people in content, language, and music than Kunqu, so it replaced Kunqu's position and dominated the opera scene, completing an important progressive change in the modern history of Chinese opera. Beijing opera has improved more than other local operas in music and acting. It can more broadly reflect historical themes and express various characters with different identities and personalities in more ways. However, this improvement of Beijing opera in the past was restricted by feudal society; as a result of this improvement, there was a gradual tendency to deviate from the lives of the people, and thus formalism was produced in some aspects. Conversely, various local folk operas have more people's nature and are closer to the lives of the people and the language of the people, so their content is more lively and the forms are more free and fresh. In recent years, local operas, especially Yue opera and Ping opera, have had many new creations worth paying attention to. It is very natural that many local operas in this performance have won the special welcome of the vast audience. Beijing opera should re-absorb the nutrients it needs from various local operas, enhance its vitality, break through the obstacles that hinder its development, and improve in the direction of the new people. At the same time, various local operas, especially folk small operas, like all other folk arts, have simple characteristics, but inevitably have weaknesses of monotony and naivety, and they all need to be improved.
    Chinese opera art reached its peak in the feudal society era with the development of Beijing opera, and since then it has no longer leaped forward, but has fallen into a state of considerable stagnation. Although Beijing opera later continued to produce many talented performing artists, none of them were able to create a new situation. Although various local folk operas are still growing and developing, most of them are in a state of self-generation and self-destruction. This state of stagnation has its profound social causes. The feudal ruling class once cultivated Beijing opera from various local operas, but this class did not give Beijing opera much positive things. The bourgeoisie, because it is more backward in culture than in politics, and because it is tainted with feudalism and compradorism, has never played any independent and positive role in the cause of developing Chinese opera art; and worse, it has made some operas lose their original national traditions and become tainted with the bad habits of commercialization and compradorization, turning art into commodities, competing for novelty, catering to the backward tastes of the petty bourgeoisie, and guiding art to the road of degeneration. For example, Cantonese opera is taking such a dangerous road. Cantonese opera is creative in music and has made many brave innovations in stage art, but its entire artistic tendency has extremely unhealthy aspects; the creation of scripts is shoddy, pursuing bizarre plots, each drama must gather six leading actors to appear on the stage at the same time, and inappropriately flaunt strange costumes. All this is not art, but precisely destroying art. There are many talented, creative, and patriotic Cantonese opera artists. They should rise up and thoroughly change this bad atmosphere and establish a new, healthy atmosphere that truly suits the needs of the people and the development of art.
    The Chinese working class is the heir to all the cultural heritage left over from the past era
    (including the opera heritage). However, because the Chinese People's Revolution has long been in a tense war environment, we have not been able to systematically sort out and collect our heritage on a large scale and develop them on a new basis. The work we have done in the past is mainly to find relatively simple forms from national art forms that can quickly reflect real life, such as yangko, to serve the current struggle. Now that the Chinese people have become the masters of the country, they must take on the responsibility of reforming and developing the opera heritage. Chinese opera can only be truly reformed and developed under the guidance of the advanced thought of the working class, gain new life, and open up new prospects.
    Comrade Mao Zedong correctly pointed out in "On New Democracy":
    "...Cleaning up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence; but it must never be uncritically absorbed. It is necessary to distinguish between all the corrupt things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent ancient people's culture, which has some democratic and revolutionary elements." Chinese opera basically belongs to this people's culture. Therefore, we communists must treat this heritage with a cautious and serious attitude. On the one hand, we oppose the crude style of arbitrarily negating and casually tampering with the heritage, and on the other hand, we also oppose the conservative idea of not criticizing and not reforming the heritage. Some comrades engaged in opera reform work randomly change old scripts, relying on their own half-knowledge, or even relying on personal feelings, to modify historical truth and character. They are not improving but destroying traditions. They do not understand that opera heritage is created by the working people of past dynasties and is the spiritual wealth of the country. To despise tradition is to despise the people and not to love the motherland. This is an intolerable and completely wrong style. This is the most harmful tendency in the current opera reform work and must be corrected first.
    Truthfully Representing the New Life of the People, Expressing History with New and Correct Views
    The opera heritage reflects the past life of the people, but the new life of the people also requires new opera to express it. Therefore, how to use various opera forms appropriately, rather than rigidly, to express the new life of the people has become a serious creative task for opera workers, both current and long-term. The broad masses are eager for scripts that express the new life of the people. Local operas that stage such scripts are mostly welcomed. The forms of Ping opera, Shanghai opera, and many other local operas have shown their ability to reflect modern life. The awards of the Ping opera "Little Son-in-Law" and the Shanghai opera "Luohan Qian" in this performance are gratifying. The scripts and performances of "Little Son-in-Law" and "Luohan Qian" are undoubtedly relatively successful. These two scripts truthfully depict the unreasonable marriage stories in the new countryside, but the kind of marriage tragedy described in many old operas does not exist here. Instead, it is the complete victory of the new advancing force over the old backward force. However, these two scripts also have shortcomings in the creative method. Since the first half of "Little Son-in-Law" describes the heroine Xiangcao herself and her surrounding environment as so progressive, it seems difficult to explain why Xiangcao was forced to marry a child later. The description of characters and the environment is not unified and not real enough. Although "Luohan Qian" has made many real and vivid descriptions of characters and the environment, it also shows reluctance and unnaturalness in handling the transformation of characters. In addition, the other two scripts, the Ping opera "Female Teacher" and the Quyi drama "New Things and New Ways," are good in terms of their themes of expressing new characters and new lives in the countryside, but due to the serious shortcomings of the script creation itself, they have not been able to realize the attempt of this theme, although the actors have also made great efforts in the performance. "Female Teacher" lacks concentration in its dramatic development. The author does not focus on seriously expressing the noble spirit of the female teacher in the education cause, but casually adds production and many other social activities to her; the author lists many problems in rural life, but does not write out the true face of rural life today; many places are the author speaking, not the characters themselves. "New Things and New Ways" also inappropriately and irrelevantly describes too many production activities, as if the significance of new-style marriage in the countryside is only to increase production; and the characters' personalities and language are also abstract and unrealistic. The common root of all these shortcomings in the works depicting rural life lies in the failure to deeply expose the complex class contradictions in the countryside and the expressions of these contradictions in all aspects of people's lives, thoughts, and habits.
    My criticisms are not to say that these scripts that express new life are not good in the programs performed this time. On the contrary, their direction is correct, and many of them are good and welcome in art; their successful or failed experiences are particularly worthy of attention and summarization. How eagerly the people are looking forward to new scripts! We demand more and better scripts. Realism requires our writers to truthfully, not idealistically, express life; it requires writers to create characters with flesh and blood and personality. This is exactly what our new playwrights should learn from the excellent traditions of Chinese opera—to learn that method of skillfully concentrating many contradictions on the central characters and events to depict them to the fullest.
    When we ask opera to express the new life of the people, we must also consider the possible contradictions between the existing forms of opera and the new content it expresses. Therefore, for various operas, we must reform on the original basis, first sort out and preserve the old excellent or better repertoires, eliminate their feudal nature in content and promote their people's nature, and improve them in artistic form, whether in music or performing arts, to enrich and improve their ability to express reality; then, according to the different development situations of each genre, those that are suitable for expressing modern life should be given full play in this regard, and those that are not yet suitable for expressing modern life but are only suitable for expressing historical and folk tale themes should not be forced to express modern life immediately, so as not to damage its inherent advantages and characteristics, but can only gradually guide it to develop in this direction. Here, impatience and crudeness are harmful.
    Most of the Chinese operas, especially Beijing opera, are originally suitable for expressing historical story themes, and we also need to create new historical dramas with new and correct viewpoints.
    The Chinese people have great interest in the history of their own country and the great achievements of their ancestors, especially in the history of the Chinese revolution in the past 100 years. Our new opera should observe and judge historical events and figures from the viewpoint of the working class; opera should help the people understand what people stood on the side of the people, promoting the advancement of history; and what people hindered the advancement of history, oppressed and exploited the people. In old operas, the history of the people was often distorted and reversed. Comrade Mao Zedong once sharply pointed out:
    "History is created by the people, but on the old stage, the people have become dregs, and the stage is ruled by masters, wives, young masters, and young ladies." The task of creating historical dramas is to restore the true face of history and express the true masters on the historical stage. The history reflected in the old operas is not only mostly about the stories of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, but also mostly in ancient times, even relatively remote ancient times. The changes in Chinese history have been the greatest in the past 100 years since the Opium War, but there is almost no reflection in the past operas. In the future, the creation of historical dramas should strive to draw themes from modern history.
    Whether expressing modern or historical life, the highest principle of art is truth. Historical truth does not allow distortion, concealment, or embellishment. Anti-historians, such as Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, do not understand this most basic principle. They believe that for the purpose of subjectively promoting revolution, they can arbitrarily fabricate and fabricate history regardless of the objective truth of history. They cannot distinguish that it is completely different to observe and describe history with the thought of the modern working class and to describe the characters in ancient history as having the thought of the modern working class.
    Historical heroes should be praised. However, any hero in history cannot be free from certain limitations of the conditions of the era in which they lived. Therefore, their progressiveness and greatness can never be compared with the advanced figures of the modern working class. However, anti-historians always try their best to portray ancient heroes as the same as modern heroes; they even portray people who were not heroes in history as heroes.
    We must learn lessons from historical mistakes, so we can also criticize the mistakes of historical figures, but this criticism must start from the specific historical conditions in which the characters lived at that time, and cannot start from our conditions today. However, anti-historians often use our scale today to measure and criticize the ancients, imposing errors on them that cannot be borne by the ancients, and forcing them to engage in self-criticism. Therefore, this is often another manifestation of "modernizing" and "idealizing" ancient figures.
    We respect myths because they express the ancient people's naive views on the world and their fantasies about a better life in the future. But anti-historians insist on using myths to allude to the current struggle. The magpies that build bridges in "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" have been changed to pigeons, simply because pigeons are a symbol of peace sought by the people of the world today. One author is even more thorough, not only calling magpies represent peace, but also calling cattle represent tractors, and alluding to Truman, airplanes, and tanks at the same time.
    The harm of anti-historicism lies in: it does not arm the people with the truth, but instills lies and nonsense into the people; it does not guide the people to look forward, but guides the people to look backward; it does not cultivate the people's new patriotic ideas, but cultivates the people's narrow nationalistic consciousness.
    We oppose the distortion of history in old operas, and we must also oppose anti-historians distorting history under the guise of Marxism-Leninism. This is an ideological struggle that we must carry out for the creation of new historical dramas.
    Whether creating scripts that express modern life or expressing history, true writers and poets are needed. Our era is too great. Our history is too rich. We need new Guan Hanqing, Ma Zhiyuan, and Wang Shifu. We look forward to the arrival of a new era of prosperity in opera.
    Creating New National Opera on the Basis of National Opera Tradition
    The primary problem of opera reform is the script, because the script is the foundation of theatrical activity. But for the creation of new opera (new opera), music is equally decisive.
    The artistic forms of Chinese opera are extremely diverse, most of which are the result of long-term historical development. Therefore, various operas have both common national characteristics and distinct local characteristics due to the different languages and folk music of various places. Each genre must absorb the essence of other genres according to its own characteristics and needs, so as to continuously enrich and improve itself.
    New music workers should actively participate in opera reform work. They must put a lot of effort into studying the music of Beijing opera and other local operas, and appropriately refer to the advanced experience of European classical music, especially modern Soviet music, to improve them in terms of musical instruments, music, and singing methods, so as to enhance the ability of Chinese opera to express new life and connect Chinese opera music with the world music culture. This is a long-term creative work, which cannot be successful in one morning, and cannot be done by the strength of a few people. New music workers must first help the original musicians of various genres learn music and improve music.
    Chinese opera music, in terms of the historical sum of all genres, is rich; but in terms of the expressive power of each individual genre, especially the ability to express modern life, it is poor and very inadequate. Many famous actors in Chinese opera, especially Beijing opera, have had many outstanding creations in vocal art. Wei Liangfu, the founder of Kunqu, was one of those who made great contributions to the construction of opera music, especially vocal art. Chinese opera musicians have also made many efforts and creations in improving playing techniques and improving musical instruments. But on the whole, Chinese opera music has not been fundamentally innovated. The status and role of musicians in opera have not been sufficiently valued and brought into play. Therefore, they have not been able to contribute greater impetus to opera reform. To reform and develop opera art, these musical forces must be fully mobilized and helped to improve in all aspects.
    In addition to Beijing opera and various other local operas, China has now produced a new type of opera represented by "The White-Haired Girl." This new opera was created after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, when new music workers, in order to express the new life and struggle of the working people, mainly based on folk songs and folk opera music, and absorbed the advanced experience of foreign music. This opera is a new thing, it is not yet mature; but due to its new content that meets the needs of the people, and also due to some successful creations in music, it has been welcomed by the masses; it should be admitted that it is a new form of national opera, and this form should be encouraged, supported, and developed. However, this new opera has not fully inherited the rich heritage of national opera, and the development of new opera can only find a bright future under this condition. Its influence among the broad masses is still far less than the original operas in China, and these operas are gradually reforming. Some local operas have no basic difference from new opera when expressing modern themes. Therefore, new opera workers must strive to earnestly learn from the original operas in China and resolutely and thoroughly overcome the erroneous view of despising the traditions of national opera. It must be recognized that talking about the creation of new opera without the foundation of national opera music would be a mistake of abandoning one's own national traditions. Our new music workers should actively participate in opera reform work in large numbers to help reform and develop our national opera art; only when new music workers have accumulated certain experience in the work of sorting out the heritage of national opera art will the creation of new opera have a real and reliable foundation, otherwise it will have no foundation, and therefore no future.
    The performing art of Chinese opera is outstanding; especially because Chinese opera combines the arts of singing, dancing, and drama, it shows its extraordinary characteristics even more. Chinese opera, especially Beijing opera, has produced a series of talented performing artists from Cheng Changgeng to Mei Lanfang. They have created various different character personalities on the stage. Their performing art is an extremely important and valuable part of our entire opera heritage, which must be correctly inherited and developed. On the other hand, there are also formalistic, naturalistic, obstructive, and backward things in performing arts, which need to be gradually reformed. There are also some stage images that distort life and damage art, which need to be continuously eliminated. But when reforming, every detail should be carefully studied and repeatedly tested. For example, using curtains to hide the stagehands is a "small matter," but because it is closely related to the performance, it needs to be studied and experimented with a lot to achieve perfection. Another example is facial makeup, which also needs to be appropriately reformed, but it is not a simple and uniform abolition. The first thing that needs to be reformed is only those symbols and patterns that insult the working people, insult ethnic minorities, cause terror, or express superstition. Other innovations in sets and costumes require careful design by stage art workers. All reforms in performance and acting must oppose crude and hasty practices on the one hand, and oppose conservative and unwilling to reform ideas on the other hand.
    Chinese operas can only finally and completely achieve the goal of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" by comprehensively but gradually reforming from the script to the performance.
    Finally, to do a good job in opera reform, we must strengthen the Party and government's ideological and artistic leadership over the opera cause. This is the main key issue. In order to strengthen this leadership, some regulations must be made in policy, such as establishing a unified system for reviewing repertoires, strengthening the management of national public and private opera troupes, and systematically training various opera actor talents, etc. Comrades have provided many valuable opinions on these issues. The Central Ministry of Culture will make specific decisions based on these opinions. I will not talk much about them here. In this report, I mainly talked about some artistic and ideological issues concerning opera reform. For opera, I am still a layman. Please give me your advice and corrections if I have said something wrong. I believe that after these performances, our opera art career will definitely make a big step forward. With the advent of the Chinese economic and cultural climax, the new era of prosperity in opera must also come. Let us work together to promote the arrival of this era!

    改革和发展民族戏曲艺术
    ——一九五二年十一月十四日在第一届全国戏曲观摩大会上的总结报告
    周扬
    观摩演出的主要意义在于学习
    这次观摩会演，有全国各地在群众中流行的二十三个剧种参加，它们以各自不同的风格表演了近一百种的剧目。像这样大规模地把民族戏曲集中展览，在中国戏曲史上还是第一次。从这次会演，我们可以清楚地看到：我们民族戏曲的遗产是这样地丰富，我们必须重新来认识它，学习它，并在新的基础上发展它。在我们面前的是一个真正的艺术的海洋。全国各种戏曲在它们的历史发展过程中虽曾有过明显的相互的影响，但从全体来说，却长期地处于一种互相隔离的，甚至闭关自守的状态，这种状态现在开始被打破了。全国各种戏曲之间开始建立起一种新的关系：一种在友谊的自由的竞赛中互相吸收、互相发展的关系。毛泽东同志所指示的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，就是最正确地规定了各种戏曲的这种相互关系和它们共同的奋斗目标。这次会演为各个剧种彼此间的互相学习观摩提供了绝好的机会，对推动今后全国戏曲的发展是一定会起极大的作用的。
    这次会演，不但集中地展览了几百年来民族戏曲的优良遗产，而且也表现了在人民政权下戏曲改革的新的成就。会演对优秀的剧目和表演进行了评奖，评奖的目的主要就是鼓励戏曲艺术的改革。评奖表示了我们所要提倡的是什么，所要反对的是什么。我们反对保守，也反对粗暴的改革。我们提倡正确的改革。我们主张按照人民的需要来改革和发展民族戏曲艺术，坚决抛弃戏曲遗产中一切反动的、有毒素的、不利于人民的部分，而保存和发扬其中一切进步的、健康的、有益于人民的部分。对于自己民族的传统，我们应当尊重、爱护，而不应当任意抛弃和破坏。我们鼓励在艺术创造上的优秀的技术，因为那些技术是艺术家为了真实地表现生活，在长期刻苦的劳动中化了无数心血得来的结果，但我们却不赞成形式主义的、矫揉造作的、没有生命的所谓“技术”。
    向优良的遗产学习，向优秀的技术学习，向戏曲改革的正确经验学习，这就是这次观摩演出大会的主要意义和任务。
    各个剧种，凡是善于学习，善于吸收别人的长处，勇于改进和创造的，它的前途就会是无限的；反之，凡是故步自封，墨守成规，因而不能适应人民的新的需要的，就会在历史的演进中遭遇失败。
    观摩演出的主要意义既然是在学习，因此评奖的目的主要也就是为了促进互相的学习。由于这次评奖仅限于参加会演的节目和艺人，因此有许多本来应该得奖的优秀的剧本和优秀的演员得不到评奖的机会。但是这次会演，对于全国戏曲工作者说来，不管他有没有参加，有没有得奖，都是一个极大的鼓励。毛主席、周总理以及中央的许多负责同志对这次会演是十分关心的，他们看了参加会演的各个剧种的演出，这对于我们是比什么都更宝贵的一种鼓励。这表现了党、政府和人民对于我们的殷切的期望。
    这次会演是成功的。竞赛会演无疑地是推进戏曲艺术发展的良好方法。今后我们将要每隔几年举行一次这种会演。但是由于我们对于会演缺少经验，又加以事先准备工作不够，这次会演工作中就不免有许多缺点。例如，全国还有一些重要剧种和优秀艺人，没有能够被邀来参加会演，或者虽然参加了会演，却没有得到适当的或充分的表演机会，因而评奖就不能作到十分周到和恰当。节目的选择和编排也还有不够完善的地方。这次会演虽有这些缺点而依然得到了很大的成功，这主要地就要归功于参加会演的全体同志的努力。
    更好地为国家和人民服务是戏曲工作者最光荣的任务
    这次戏曲会演得到成功，受到人民和国家的重视，并没有任何理由可以使我们丝毫自满，而是相反地，大大加重了我们每一个戏曲工作者对国家和人民所负的责任。戏曲既是这样一种联系千百万群众的艺术，那末，它应当如何配合我们国家正在开始的大规模经济建设和文化建设，发挥出它更大的教育人民、改造社会的力量呢？它应当帮助国家正确地教育人民，用爱国的思想，民主的和社会主义的思想教育人民，传播社会的新的风气，提高人民的道德品质，丰富人民的精神生活。如果不能这样，在新的人民的生活中也就没有它的光荣的地位。
    新中国成立以来，全国戏曲工作者为了使戏曲艺术适合于国家和人民的需要，曾作了多方面的改革的努力。戏曲改革工作是有成绩的；这从这次会演的一些优秀节目和演出也可以看出来。特别值得指出的是，广大戏曲艺人三年来在戏曲改革上以及在各种社会政治活动上，表现了高度的积极性和爱国热情，对于共产党和人民政府表现了热忱的衷心的拥护。戏曲艺人们的这种情绪是完全可以理解的。因为在反动统治的旧社会中，他们长期地受着迫害侮辱，而他们的艺术则被轻视、糟踏。许多艺人的演剧生涯是充满血泪的。中国人民革命的胜利，首先带给艺人的，就是他们自身的解放。他们在新的国家中的地位不再是被侮辱，而是被尊敬；他们的艺术也不再是被轻视、糟踏，而是被重视，被珍贵了。广大戏曲艺人在各方面所表现出来的进步，就是用实际行动表明了他们没有辜负国家和人民对于他们的重视和期望。
    但是不可否认，在戏曲艺人的面前还有许多的困难。戏曲既然是人民在旧社会中所创造出来的，其中许多部分自然不可避免地带有一些封建性的糟粕，而更重要的是人民的新生活要求新的戏曲，因此要使戏曲更好地完全地适合新的社会的需要，必须有正确的改革和更多的创造。广大戏曲艺人在旧社会中大都被剥夺了受教育的权利，他们中间许多人缺少必要的文化知识和艺术修养，同时他们又或多或少地传染了旧社会的一些旧意识和旧习惯。为着改造和提高自己，使成为具有新的思想和作风、具有文化和艺术修养的、新的人民的艺术家，还需要戏曲艺人们作许多的重大的努力。
    党和政府的责任主要就在帮助戏曲艺人克服旧思想、旧作风，而建立新思想、新作风；帮助艺人从政治上、文化上、艺术上提高；使他们了解国家的基本情况和政策；使他们接近人民的生活，了解人民的需要，使他们在和新文艺工作者的密切合作之下来进行戏曲改革。各地党和政府的很多文化工作干部对待艺人和戏曲改革工作是采取了正确态度的，但也有不少干部采取了错误的粗暴的态度。这些干部不是在戏曲改革工作上和艺人建立亲密的同志般的合作关系，而是对他们采取一种居高临下的官僚主义的态度。他们不尊重艺人的技术，却轻视那些技术，认为都是些“落后”的、“应该消灭”的东西。对于艺人，只看见旧社会所遗留在他们身上的坏影响，而没有看到他们的进步，没有看到他们正在竭力地摆脱那些坏影响。在戏曲改革工作中，他们不是发动艺人的积极性、创造性，依靠艺人进行改革，而是自以为是地靠自己的“本领”抛开艺人单独蛮干。有的干部对待艺人甚至像旧封建统治者对待艺人一样。他们的这一切错误态度又是与他们的轻视民族艺术遗产，轻视人民传统，轻视群众的爱好等等相关联的。这些错误态度如果不加以克服，我们就不可能引导广大的戏曲艺术工作者更好地为国家和人民服务。
    正确地发扬民族戏曲艺术的优良传统，反对保守观念和粗暴作风
    中国的戏曲遗产不但有悠久的历史，丰富的内容，而且始终保持了和广大人民的密切的精神联系，为人民所喜爱。这些戏曲遗产，许多都是历代劳动人民或人民的文学家、艺术家所创造，因而具有强烈的人民性和现实主义的精神。虽然这些遗产曾经被封建统治者所肆意地加以利用和歪曲，但戏曲究竟是一种比较地最具有群众性、民主性的艺术形式，它的流传主要决定于广大观众的支持和爱好，而人民的爱好则不是任何统治者所得以强迫的。人民以自己的眼光观察周围的现实生活，同时根据自己的生活经验，把历史和传说的故事加上自己的想像和判断，就在各种戏曲中创造了他们所向往，所喜爱的人物。人民的爱憎是分明的。和封建统治者的意志相反，人民的真正同情总是在被压迫者，被欺凌者的一面，那些弱小的、善良的人们一面，而对于那些骑在人民头上的凶恶的压迫者、剥削者，则表示了深深的愤怒和蔑视。他们歌颂那些敢于反抗压迫，反抗暴力，为自己的生存和幸福而奋斗的英雄的、正义的人们。他们喜爱那些大公无私，见义勇为的人物，憎恶那些胆小自私、见利忘义的卑鄙小人。人民是充满爱国心的。他们歌颂捍卫祖国的民族英雄，而憎恶背叛祖国的民族败类。这就是为什么人民在戏曲中那样地歌颂岳飞、杨家将、薛仁贵，而反对秦桧、潘洪、张士贵（在这里，真正的潘洪、张士贵究竟是否坏人并不重要）之类的人；那样地歌颂梁山泊的英雄们，而反对高俅、西门庆之类的人；那样地同情白蛇、青蛇，而厌恶法海。很清楚地可以看出：中国戏曲，虽然其中掺杂了不少封建性的糟粕，但它们的人民性和现实主义的光彩，却是始终不可泯灭的。
    中国戏曲，正是由于表现了人民的生活，表现了人民的思想、感情、心理、意志和愿望，而其表现形式又具有人民的风格，所以为群众所喜爱。从中国戏曲中，我们不但感到了强大的现实主义的力量，而且也感到了强大的人民道德的力量。戏曲反映了中国民族的性格，反过来，又在民族性格、民族心理的发展过程上起了一定的作用。戏曲中所创造的英雄人物曾多少代地影响了中国人民。当我们谈到戏曲给予我们民族性格的这种积极影响的时候，我们又必须看到其中包含有不能代表我们民族性格的消极影响的一面。戏曲反映了人民在封建制度下的追求自由的意志和愿望，表现了人民的勇敢、勤劳、智慧、善良的性格；但在另一方面，我们不可忘了：封建统治者也曾竭力地利用戏曲来培养人民的奴颜婢膝的消极屈服的性格，而且竭力使人民的一切优良性格来服务于维持和巩固封建统治的利益。人民是勤劳的，封建统治者就利用这种勤劳来让人民像牛马一样地供他驱使；人民是勇敢的，封建统治者就利用这种勇敢来让人民不惜性命地保护他的统治。在戏曲中，人民性常常像压在石头下面的草一样顽强地曲折地伸长出来，人民性和封建性的因素常常错综复杂地纠缠在一起。好些戏曲暴露了人民和封建制度的不可调和的矛盾，但找不到解决这个矛盾的正确出路，于是就以妥协的道路来使矛盾和解。“蝴蝶杯”就是这样的。这是一个非常富有戏剧性的戏曲，它的前半部充满了对于恶势力的正义反抗和对劳动人民的热烈同情，但到了后半部，就在一个被巧妙地安排的恋爱纠葛中，仇人变作了亲人，斗争变成了和好。这次会演的晋剧“蝴蝶杯”和秦腔“游龟山”（即其前半部）的剧本的修改，虽还不是完善的，但却是必要的，有益的工作。
    “梁山伯与祝英台”和“白蛇传”是在中国戏曲中特别卓越的，它们是真正的人民的杰作。这次会演的越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”，川剧“柳荫记”（“梁山伯与祝英台”的另一名称），京剧和越剧的“白蛇传”的剧本和演出，都获得了不同程度的成功。这两个剧本强烈地表现了中国人民，特别是妇女追求自由和幸福的不可征服的意志，以及她们的勇敢的自我牺牲的精神，她们在远非她们的力量所能抵抗的强暴的压迫者面前竟敢于抵抗，没有丝毫动摇，没有妥协；她们至死不屈；简直可以说，她们的爱战胜了死。自然，她们的胜利只是在幻想的形式中取得的。一对爱人死了，怎么能够化为比翼双飞的蝴蝶，一个人压在雷峰塔下怎么还能复活？这是幻想，但也是真实，因为它最真实地表达了人民对于自由的不可抑止的渴望。不正是这种幻想鼓舞了一代代的人们为挣脱封建主义的婚姻制度的枷锁而不屈地斗争吗？雷峰塔不是终于倒塌了吗？鲁迅就曾以充满高度热情的词句歌颂了这个带有象征性的雷峰塔的倒掉。
    在这里，我要顺便解释一下由于幻想而产生的神话传说与迷信故事的区别。无论是神话或迷信，本来都是反映了古代人们对于世界的一种幼稚的认识，一种对于超自然的力量的信仰；但两者的意义却有不同。因为并不是凡涉及超自然的力量的，都是应该唾弃的迷信；许多神话对于世界往往采取积极的态度，往往富于人民性；而迷信则总是消极的，往往反映统治阶级的利益。这种区别最突出地表现在对待命运的态度上面。神话往往表现人们不肯屈服于命运，并在幻想形式中征服命运。相反地，迷信则恰恰是宣传宿命论，宣传因果报应，让人们相信一切都由命定，只好在命运面前低头。由于对命运的看法不同，因而对于作为命运主宰者的神就采取了不同的态度。神话往往是敢于反抗神的权威的，如孙悟空的反抗玉皇大帝，牛郎织女的反抗王母；迷信则是宣传人对于神的无力，必须做神的奴隶和牺牲品。因此，神话往往是鼓励人努力摆脱自己所处的奴隶的地位而追求一种真正的人的生活，迷信则是使人心甘情愿地安于做奴隶，并把奴隶的锁链加以美化。为什么我们反对迷信而又赞成神话，其理由就在这里。
    可以看出，中国戏曲中的现实主义是具有它的独特之处的。它既真实地反映了封建社会的残酷的现实，又热情地表现了对于未来美好生活的理想、希望和信心；在这里，现实主义和浪漫主义取得了和谐的结合。中国戏曲所特有简炼和夸张的手法，就使这个结合达到了艺术的高度。我们不但在像“白蛇传”“梁山伯与祝英台”这样的大的悲剧中，而且也在像川剧“秋江”、“评雪辨踪”、楚剧“葛麻”那样小小的喜剧中，都同样地看到了这种特点，那些喜剧把人民的机智、幽默和热情绝妙地揉合在一起了。
    中国戏曲达到了相当高度的现实主义，并不是偶然的。中国戏曲，从它的黄金时代——元代到现在，已经有了近七百年的历史；它在几百年的发展过程中不断地被人民的创作所补充、修正和丰富。中国现有各种戏曲，都是由民间戏曲发展而来的。京剧虽曾进入过宫庭，但它的基础仍是民间的，并且始终保持了和人民的联系。大家知道，京剧在清代中叶开始形成和发展的时候，就是综合了当时的二簧、秦腔等几种比较出色的地方戏曲，并吸收了崑曲的精华而成的；它在内容上、语言上和音乐上都比崑剧更接近人民，因而就代替了崑剧的地位而统治了剧坛，在中国近代戏曲史上完成了一个重要的进步的变革。京剧在音乐和演技上比其它地方戏曲更提高了，它能够更广阔地反映历史题材，更多方面地表现各种不同身份和性格的人物。但是，过去京剧的这种提高，是受着封建社会的限制的；这种提高的结果，逐渐产生了脱离人民生活的倾向，因而也就在某些方面产生了形式主义。反之，各种地方民间戏曲，则带有较多的人民性，更接近人民的生活，人民的语言，因而它们的内容就更生动活泼得多，形式就更自由、更新鲜。几年来，地方戏曲，特别是越剧和评剧，有了不少值得重视的新的创造。这次会演中许多地方戏曲博得了广大观众的格外欢迎，是很自然的。京剧应当从各种地方戏曲中重新吸取自己所需要的养料，增强自己生命的活力，突破那些妨碍自己发展的障碍，向着新的人民的方向提高。同时，各地方戏曲，特别是民间小戏，像一切其他民间艺术一样，具有朴素的特色，但也不免有单调、幼稚的弱点，也都有待于提高。
    中国戏曲艺术，在封建社会时代，以京剧的发达而达到了它的最高峰，从此便不再向前跃进，而陷入一种相当停滞的状态。虽然后来京剧曾继续地产生了不少天才的表演艺术家，但他们也都没有能够开创新的局面。虽然各地方民间戏曲仍在不断地生长着，发展着，但大都处于一种自生自灭的境地。这种停滞状态是有它深刻的社会原因的。封建统治阶级曾经从各种地方戏曲中培植了京剧，但是这个阶级也并没有给京剧多少积极的东西。资产阶级则由于它在文化上比政治上还落后，又加以它本身所沾染的封建性、买办性，它对发展中国戏曲艺术的事业就从来没有起过任何独立的积极的作用；而更坏的是，它竟使某些戏曲丧失了自己原有的民族传统，而染上商业化、买办化的恶劣风气，把艺术变成商品，竞尚新奇，迎合小市民的落后趣味，将艺术引导到堕落的道路。比方，粤剧正走了这样危险的道路。粤剧在音乐上是有创造的，在舞台艺术上也有不少勇敢的革新，但它的整个艺术倾向却有极不健全的地方；剧本创作粗制滥造，追求离奇的情节，每个剧中都要凑足六个主角同时登场，并不适当地以奇异服装相炫耀，这一切不但不是艺术，而且恰恰是破坏艺术。粤剧艺人中有不少有天才的、有创造性的、富有爱国心的，他们应当起来彻底改变这种恶劣风气，而建立一种真正适合于人民需要和艺术发展的新的、健全的风气。
    中国工人阶级是过去时代所留下的一切文化遗产
    （包括戏曲遗产在内）的继承者。但是由于中国人民革命曾长期地处在紧张的战争环境，我们没有可能大规模地、有系统地来整理和搜集我们的遗产，并且在新的基础上来发展它们。我们过去所做的工作，主要是从民族艺术形式中找到那些能够迅速反映现实生活的比较简单的形式，例如秧歌，用来为当前的斗争服务。现在当中国人民已经成为国家的主人的时候，就必须把改革和发展戏曲遗产的责任担在自己肩上。中国戏曲也只有在工人阶级先进思想的指导之下才能得到真正的改革和发展，才能获得新的生命，开辟新的前途。
    毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中正确地指出：
    “……清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”中国戏曲基本上就是属于这种人民文化。因此，我们共产主义者必须以谨慎的严肃的态度对待这个遗产。我们一方面反对对遗产任意否定，随便窜改的粗暴作风，另一方面也反对对于遗产不加批判，不肯改革的保守观念。有些从事戏曲改革工作的同志乱改旧有剧本，凭自己一知半解的知识，甚至凭个人感想，修改历史真实和人物性格，他们不是在改进而是在破坏传统，他们不懂得戏曲遗产是历代劳动人民创造的，是国家的精神财富；轻视传统，就是轻视人民，不爱祖国。这是一种不能容忍的，完全错误的作风，这是目前戏曲改革工作中最有害的倾向，必须首先加以纠正。
    真实地表现人民新生活，用新的正确的观点表现历史
    戏曲遗产是反映过去人民的生活的，但新的人民生活，也要求新的戏曲来表现它。因此，如何用各种戏曲形式恰当地，而不是生硬地来表现人民的新生活，成为戏曲工作者当前的，也是长期的一个严重的创造性的任务。广大群众渴望表现人民新生活的剧本。各地方戏曲，凡是上演这类剧本的时候，大多数都是受到欢迎的。评剧、沪剧及许多其他地方戏曲的形式都表现了它们能够反映现代生活的能力。这次评剧的“小女婿”、沪剧的“罗汉钱”等的获奖，是值得高兴的。“小女婿”和“罗汉钱”的剧本和演出无疑地都是比较成功的。这两个剧本真实地描写了新的农村中不合理的婚姻故事，但像许多旧有戏曲中所描写的那种婚姻悲剧，在这里是不存在了，代替的，是新的前进的力量对于旧的落后的力量的完全胜利。但这两个剧本在创作方法上也还是有缺点的。“小女婿”的前半部把女主人公香草本人和她周围的环境既然都写得那样进步，后来香草被迫嫁一个小孩就显得有些难于解释了，人物和环境的描写就成为不够统一，不够真实了。“罗汉钱”对人物和环境虽作了不少真实的、生动的描写，但在处理人物的转变上也同样显出了勉强的和不自然的地方。另外两个剧本，评剧“女教师”和曲艺剧“新事新办”，从它们表现农村中的新人物和新生活的主题来说，是好的，但由于剧本创作本身的严重缺点，并没有能够实现这个主题的企图，虽然演员在表演上也作了很大的努力。“女教师”的戏剧发展缺少集中性，作者没有集中地认真表现女教师在教育事业中的崇高精神，反而把生产及其他许多社会活动随便地加在她的身上；作者罗列了农村生活中的许多问题，却并没有写出今天农村生活的真实面貌；许多地方是作者在说话，而不是人物自己在说话。“新事新办”也是不适当地、与主题无关地描写了过多的生产活动，仿佛农村中的新式结婚的意义只不过为了增加生产而已；而人物的性格和语言也是抽象的，不真实的。所有这些描写农村生活的作品的缺点，其共同的根源，都在于没有深刻地揭露出农村中复杂的阶级矛盾以及这些矛盾在人民的生活、思想、习惯各方面的表露。
    我的这些批评并不是说这些表现新生活的剧本，在这次演出的节目中都是不好的。相反，它们的方向是正确的，在艺术上也有不少是好的，值得欢迎的；它们的成功或失败的经验，都特别值得加以重视，加以总结。人民对于新的剧本是抱着多么热切的期望啊！我们要求更多更好的剧本。现实主义要求我们的作家真实地，而不是空想地去表现生活；要求作家创作有血有肉的、有性格的人物。这也正是我们新的剧作家应当向中国戏曲的优良传统学习的地方——要学习那种善于把许多矛盾集中在中心人物和事件上来尽情描画的方法。
    当我们要求戏曲表现人民新生活的时候，又必须考虑到现有各种戏曲形式和它所表现的新的内容之间可能发生的矛盾，因此，对于各种戏曲，必须在原有基础上进行改革，首先整理和保存其旧有的优秀的或较好的剧目，在内容上剔除其封建性而发扬其人民性，在艺术形式上，不论是在音乐或表演艺术上，加以改进，以丰富和提高其表现现实的能力；然后按照各个剧种发展的不同情况，凡适合于表现现代生活的，就使它在这方面得到充分的发挥，凡目前尚不适合于表现现代生活，而只适合于表现历史和民间传说的题材的，就不要强求它立刻表现现代生活，以致损害它固有的优点和特色，而只能逐步地引导它向这个方向发展。在这里，性急和粗暴是有害的。
    中国戏曲，特别是京剧，多数本来是适合于表现历史故事的题材的，我们也需要用新的正确的观点来创作新的历史剧。
    中国人民对于自己国家的历史和自己祖先的丰功伟绩，特别是对于近百年中国革命的历史是抱着极大的兴趣的。我们的新的戏曲应当是以工人阶级的观点来观察和判断历史的事件和人物；戏曲应当帮助人民认识，推动历史前进的，站在人民一方面的有些什么人；阻碍历史前进的，压迫、剥削人民的又有些什么人。在旧有戏曲中，人民的历史常常是被歪曲，被颠倒了的。毛泽东同志曾经尖锐指出：
    “历史是人民创造的，但在旧舞台上人民却成了渣滓，由老爷、太太、少爷、小姐统治着舞台。”创造历史剧的任务，就是要恢复历史的真实面目，表现历史舞台上的真正主人。旧有戏曲中所反映的历史不但很多是关于帝、王、将、相的故事，而且多在古代甚至比较辽远的古代。鸦片战争以来一百多年中，中国历史的变化最大，但在过去的戏曲中却几乎完全没有什么反映。今后创作历史剧应当努力从近代历史吸取题材。
    无论表现现代的或历史的生活，艺术的最高原则是真实。历史的真实不容许歪曲、掩盖或粉饰。反历史主义者，例如杨绍萱同志，就是不懂得这条最基本的原则。他们以为为了主观的宣传革命的目的，可以不顾历史的客观真实而任意地杜撰和捏造历史。他们不能区别，用现代工人阶级的思想去观察和描写历史，与把古代历史上的人物描写成有现代工人阶级的思想，是完全两回事。
    历史上的英雄人物是应当加以歌颂的。但是历史上的任何英雄都不能不受他们所处的时代的条件的
    一定限制，因而他们的进步性、伟大性，就决不能和现代工人阶级的先进人物相比。而反历史主义者却总是尽量想把古代英雄人物描写成和现代的英雄人物一样；他们甚至把历史上并不是什么英雄的人物也都描写成英雄了。
    我们要从历史的错误中取得教训，因此也可以批评历史人物的错误，但这种批评必须从人物当时所处的具体历史条件出发，而不能从我们今天的条件出发。但是反历史主义者却常常拿我们今天的尺度来衡量和批评古人，把不能由古人负责的错误妄加在他的头上，并且还要强迫他进行自我批评。因此，这常常也是把古代人物“现代化”“理想化”的另一种表现。
    我们尊重神话，因为它表现了古代人们对于世界的天真看法和对未来美好生活的幻想。但反历史主义者却硬要用神话来影射当前现实的斗争。“牛郎织女”中搭桥的喜鹊就改成了鸽子，无非因为鸽子是今天全世界人民所争取的和平的象征。有位作者却更彻底了，不但叫喜鹊代表了和平，而且叫耕牛代表了拖拉机，同时把杜鲁门、飞机、坦克都一齐影射了。
    反历史主义的害处就在：它不是以真理武装人民，而是把谎话和不伦不类的杜撰灌输给人民；它不是引导人民向前看，而是引导人民向后看；它不是培养人民的新的爱国主义的思想，而是培养人民狭隘民族主义的意识。
    我们反对旧有戏曲中对历史的歪曲，同时也要反对反历史主义者冒充马列主义而对历史进行新的歪曲。这是我们为新的历史剧的创造而必须进行的一个思想斗争的工作。
    无论是创作表现现代生活或表现历史的剧本，都需要真正的文学家、诗人来担任。我们的时代太伟大了。我们的历史太丰富了。我们需要新的关汉卿、马致远、王实甫，我们期待一个新的戏曲的繁荣的时代到来。
    在民族戏曲传统的基础上，创造民族新戏曲
    戏曲改革的首要问题是剧本，因为剧本是戏剧活动的基础。但对于新戏曲（新歌剧）的创造说来，音乐同样具有决定性的意义。
    中国戏曲艺术形式是极多样的，其中大多数是长久的历史发展的结果。因此，各种戏曲一方面具有共同的民族特点，另一方面又因各地语言和民间音乐的不同而带有鲜明的地方特色。各个剧种都必须按照自己的特点和需要，来吸收其他剧种的精华，这样来不断地丰富自己，提高自己。
    新的音乐工作者应当积极地参加戏曲改革工作。他们必须下很大的功夫来研究京剧及其它各种地方戏曲的音乐，并适当地参照欧洲古典音乐，特别是现代苏联音乐的先进经验，在乐器、乐曲、唱法各方面加以改进，以增强中国戏曲表现新的生活的能力，并使中国戏曲音乐和世界音乐文化沟通起来。这是一个长期的创造性的工作，决不是一个早上所能够成功的，也决非少数人的力量所能做到的。新的音乐工作者首先就必须帮助各个剧种原有的乐师学习音乐，改进音乐。
    中国戏曲音乐，就所有各个剧种的历史的总和来说，是丰富的；但单独就每一个剧种的表现力，特别是表现现代生活的能力来说，却又是贫乏的，十分不够的。中国戏曲特别是京剧的许多著名演员在声乐艺术上都曾有过很多的卓越的创造。崑曲的创始者魏良辅就是对戏曲音乐，特别是声乐艺术的建设有很大贡献的一人。中国戏曲的乐师在提高演奏技术和改进乐器方面也都有过很多的努力和创造。但是整个说来，中国戏曲音乐并没有根本的革新。乐师在戏曲中的地位和作用还没有足够地被重视和被发挥。因此，他们对戏曲改革就还没有能够尽到更大的推动的力量。要改革和发展戏曲艺术，必须将这些音乐力量充分发动起来，并从各方面帮助他们提高。
    中国现在除了京剧和其它各种地方戏曲之外，已经产生了一种由“白毛女”所代表的新型的歌剧。这种新歌剧是在延安文艺座谈会以后，新的音乐工作者为了表现新的劳动人民的生活和斗争，主要以民歌和民间戏曲音乐为基础，同时吸收了外国音乐的先进经验而创造出来的。这种歌剧是新生的东西，它还没有成熟；但由于它的符合人民需要的新内容，也由于音乐上的一部分成功的创造，它已经受到了群众的欢迎；应当承认它是民族戏曲的一种新形式，这种形式是应当加以鼓励，扶植，加以发展的。但是这种新歌剧还没有充分地继承民族戏曲的丰富遗产，而新歌剧的发展只有在这个条件下才能找到光明的前途。它在广大人民中间的影响目前还远不及中国原有的各种戏曲，同时这些戏曲正在逐渐革新，有些地方戏曲在表现现代题材的时候，和新歌剧已经没有什么基本的区别了。因此，新的歌剧工作者必须努力地认真地向中国原有的各种戏曲学习，坚决地彻底地克服那种轻视民族戏曲传统的错误观点。必须认识，离开了民族戏曲音乐的基础，而空谈什么新歌剧的创造，那就会犯抛弃自己民族传统的错误。我们的新的音乐工作者应当大批地积极地参加到戏曲改革的工作中去，帮助改革和发展我们民族的戏曲艺术；只有当新的音乐工作者在整理民族戏曲艺术遗产的工作中累积了一定的经验之后，新歌剧的创造才有真实的、可靠的基础，否则是没有基础的，因而也是没有前途的。
    中国戏曲的表演艺术，是杰出的；特别是因为中国戏曲综合了歌、舞、剧三者的艺术，就更显出了它的非凡的特色。中国戏曲，特别是京剧，曾产生了从程长庚到梅兰芳的一系列的天才的表演艺术家。他们在舞台上创造了各种不同的人物性格。他们的表演艺术是我们整个戏曲遗产的一个极其重要的宝贵的部分，必须正确地加以继承和发展。另一方面，在表演艺术中，也存在有形式主义的、自然主义的、妨碍表演的、落后的东西，需要逐步加以改革。还有一些歪曲生活损害艺术的舞台形象，需要继续加以革除。但在进行改革时，对于每一细节，都应经过慎重研究和反复试验。比如，用幕来隐蔽检场，这虽是一件“小事”，但因为与表演密切联系，也就需要经过很多的研究和实验，才能达到完美的地步。又如脸谱，也是需要适当改革的，但也不是简单的一律的废止。首先需要改革的只是那些侮辱劳动人民、侮辱少数民族的、引起恐怖或表示迷信的符号和图案。其它如布景、服装方面的革新均需要有舞台美术工作者的精心的设计。凡在演出与表演上的改革，都要一方面反对粗暴的急性的作法，另方面，又要反对保守的不肯改革的思想。
    中国的各种戏曲，只有从剧本到演出，全面地但是逐步地进行改革，才能最后地完满实现“百花齐放，推陈出新”的目的。
    最后，要做好戏曲改革工作，必须加强党和政府对戏曲事业的思想的和艺术的领导。这是主要关键问题。为着加强这种领导，就必须在政策上作出一些规定，如建立统一审定剧目的制度，加强全国公私营剧团的管理，有计划地培养各种戏曲演员人才等等，关于这些问题，同志们提供了很多宝贵的意见，中央文化部将根据这些意见作出具体的决定，我不在此多谈了。我在这个报告中主要谈了一些关于戏曲改革的艺术思想方面的问题；对于戏曲，我现在还是门外汉，有说得不对的地方，就请大家指教和纠正吧。我相信，经过这些会演，我们的戏曲艺术事业是一定会大大前进一步的。随着中国经济和文化高潮的到来，戏曲的新的繁荣的时代也一定要到来的。让我们同心协力，来促进这个时代的到来吧！
