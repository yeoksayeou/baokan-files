    All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    Decision on Changing the Structure and Tasks of the Democratic Women's Federations at the Greater Administrative Area Level
    In order to adapt to the "Decision of the Central People's Government on Changing the Structure and Tasks of the Greater Administrative Area People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees)," to strengthen the connection between the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the democratic women's federations of various provinces and cities, and to strengthen the work of local democratic women's federations, the Fourth Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation has decided: to change all the original democratic women's federations or preparatory committees in the greater administrative areas into Women's Work Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas, serving as representative organs of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation stationed in the major regions. The members of these committees may be nominated by the original democratic women's federations or preparatory committees of the major administrative areas and approved by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.
    The Women's Work Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas will work under the unified and centralized leadership of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. Their tasks are to assist the All-China Democratic Women's Federation in supervising and inspecting the work of local democratic women's federations, promptly reflect work situations, summarize work experiences, and train women's federation work cadres.
    The original democratic women's federations or preparatory committees of the major administrative areas should immediately formulate implementation measures based on this decision and in conjunction with their specific circumstances. The organizational division of labor and staffing of the Women's Work Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas should be proposed by the original democratic women's federations or preparatory committees of the major administrative areas and implemented after approval by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.
    The reorganization of the institutions should be completed no later than the end of January 1953.
