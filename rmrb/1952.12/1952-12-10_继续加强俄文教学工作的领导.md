    Learning Russian is of great significance for our national construction. By mastering Russian, we can learn more directly from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, greatly promote cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, better apply the Soviet Union's rich experience in industry, agriculture, science, technology, and the arts, and help us improve our work standards and methods. Therefore, many advanced fighters striving for the happiness of the Chinese people are eager to learn Russian.

    The Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to learning Russian—the language of Lenin and Stalin. As early as 1941, at the initiative of the Party, the Russian Language School was established in Yan'an. After the victory of the revolution, the Party and the government established many Russian language schools throughout the country to cultivate a large number of Russian translation talents.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of Russian language teaching, the first National Russian Language Teaching Work Conference was held in September 1951, stipulating many measures related to learning Russian. Subsequently, the National Russian Language Teaching Steering Committee was established, and the magazine "Russian Language Teaching" was published, marking a new stage in the nationwide Russian language teaching work.

    Currently, there are eight relatively large-scale Russian language specialized schools across the country, with nearly 10,000 students. There are 59 universities and independent colleges with Russian language departments (groups) or Russian language specialized courses, with a total of about 10,000 students according to incomplete statistics. Other colleges and universities have also opened Russian language courses for students to choose from. Many middle schools have now established Russian language courses. For example, almost all middle schools in the Northeast region have established Russian language courses, and 55 ordinary middle schools in Beijing have also established Russian language courses. In addition, many Russian language night schools and amateur Russian language classes have been established throughout the country, with more than 1,000 in Shanghai alone. According to incomplete statistics in September of this year, the Russian language night schools and amateur Russian language classes organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in only 19 places numbered more than 110. Many county towns have also opened Russian language night schools and amateur Russian language classes.

    Now the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is beginning to promote the movement of learning Russian to all small towns. A large number of people across the country hope to learn Russian. Many places have held Russian language broadcast lectures. According to incomplete statistics in September, nearly 200,000 people listened to Russian language broadcasts, and more than 20,000 students in Shanghai alone learned Russian through broadcasts. In addition, many people are studying Russian on their own. In order to solve the problem of teachers for Russian language night schools and amateur Russian language classes, the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its local branches have also held several teacher training classes.

    In the past three years, Russian language specialized schools across the country have trained thousands of cadres proficient in Russian. They are distributed throughout the country, engaged in various work related to Russian and assisting Soviet experts in their work. Many of them have mastered Russian in their long-term Russian work, and have gradually accumulated professional knowledge and mastered the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, becoming Russian talents with professional knowledge. Many people who participated in Russian language night schools, amateur Russian language classes, and Russian language broadcast lectures have now become Russian language teachers or translators.

    Recently, teachers and students from Peking University and Tsinghua University have researched a crash course method for reading Russian professional books and have achieved good results. People participating in this type of learning can memorize 1,000 to 2,000 Russian words and master the basic rules of grammar within a month, enabling them to read professional Russian books in a short period of time. Naturally, this method cannot replace comprehensive and formal study, but it plays a significant role in mastering the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improving Russian language teaching.

    Soviet experts engaged in Russian language teaching in our country have provided great help to our Russian language learning. They have helped us carry out Russian language teaching work according to the instructions of Comrade Stalin in his linguistic works, helped us formulate teaching plans and teaching outlines, helped us improve the organization and leadership of teaching work, helped us establish teaching research offices, data rooms, and teaching libraries, and helped us compile textbooks and teaching materials. They have also familiarized us with advanced Soviet teaching methods. Soviet experts have helped us improve our work in all aspects.

    The movement to learn Russian has been widely launched throughout the country, and the number of scientists, teachers, literary and artistic workers, engineers, students, and staff of state organs participating in this movement is increasing day by day. During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," a wave of enthusiasm for learning Russian was set off in various places. This wave of enthusiasm for learning Russian demonstrates the Chinese people's ardent desire to learn from the Soviet Union, and demonstrates the Chinese people's love for the Soviet people and Comrade Stalin. This is a manifestation of the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Soviet people.

    Although we have achieved many successes in learning Russian, there are still many shortcomings in Russian language teaching. For example, so far we do not have suitable and good Russian language textbooks; our translators and Russian language teachers, both in quality and quantity, are far behind the needs of the country; we still lack necessary reference books and teaching reference materials, and we have not yet summarized and promoted mature experience from past work. These situations all show that the tasks before us are very arduous, and we should continue to strengthen leadership in Russian language teaching with greater effort.

### 继续加强俄文教学工作的领导

    继续加强俄文教学工作的领导
    张锡俦
    学习俄文对于我们的国家建设具有重大的意义。我们通晓了俄文，就可以更直接地学习苏联的先进经验，可以大大地促进中苏两国的文化交流，可以更好地应用苏联在工业、农业、科学、技术和艺术等各方面的丰富经验，可以帮助我们提高工作水平和改进工作方法。因此，许多争取中国人民幸福生活的先进战士都迫切地要求学习俄文。
    中国共产党向来非常重视学习俄文——列宁、斯大林的语言。远在一九四一年，由于党的创议，在延安成立了俄文学校。革命胜利以后，党和政府就在全国范围内成立了许多俄文学校，以便培养大批的俄文翻译人才。
    为了加强对俄文教学工作的领导，一九五一年九月召开了第一次全国俄文教学工作会议，规定了有关学习俄文的许多措施。随后成立了全国俄文教学指导委员会，出版了“俄文教学”杂志，从此全国的俄文教学工作进入了新的阶段。
    目前全国各地已设有较具规模的俄文专科学校八所，共有学生近万人。设有俄文系（组）或俄文专修科的大学和独立学院，据不完全统计，全国现有五十九处，学生总数也在一万人左右。其他院校也开设了俄文课程供全校学生选读。很多中学现已设立了俄文课。例如：东北地区的中学几乎已经全部设立了俄文课，北京市五十五所普通中学也都已设立了俄文课。此外，全国各地还设立了不少俄文夜校、业余俄文班等，仅上海一地即在一千处以上。根据今年九月份不完全的统计，仅十九个地方的中苏友好协会组织所办的俄文夜校和业余俄文班就有一百一十个以上。许多县城也都开设了俄文夜校和业余俄文班。
    现在中苏友好协会总会正开始把学习俄文的运动推广到所有的小城镇去。全国各地都有大批的人希望学习俄文。许多地方举办了俄语广播讲座，根据九月份不完全的统计，收听俄语广播的人将近二十万，仅上海一地利用广播学习俄文的学员已有两万多人。此外，还有很多人自学俄文。为了解决俄文夜校和业余俄文班的师资问题，中苏友好协会总会及其各地分会并举办了若干师资训练班。
    三年来，全国各地的俄文专科学校已经培养了数千名通晓俄文的干部，他们分布在全国各地从事着和俄文有关的各项工作，并协助苏联专家进行工作。他们中间有许多人在长期的俄文工作中掌握了俄文，并逐渐积聚了专业知识和掌握了苏联的先进经验，成为拥有专业知识的俄文人才。参加俄文夜校、业余俄文班以及俄语广播讲座学习的许多人，现在也已成为俄文教员或翻译人员。
    最近北京大学和清华大学的教师和学生研究出一种阅读俄文专业书籍的速成方法，并且获得了良好的效果。参加这种学习的人，在一个月的时间内，能记住一千到两千个俄文单词，并掌握基本的语法规律，从而使他们在短时期内能够阅读专业的俄文书籍。自然，这种方法不能代替全面发展的正规学习，但它对于掌握苏联的先进经验和改进俄文教学工作却起着很大的作用。
    在我国从事俄文教学工作的苏联专家，对我们的俄文学习给予了很大的帮助。他们帮助我们根据斯大林同志在其语言学著作中的各项指示进行俄文教学工作，帮助我们制定教学计划和教学大纲，帮助我们改进教学工作的组织领导，帮助我们成立教学研究室、资料室和教学图书室，并帮助我们编选教科书和教学材料。他们还使我们熟悉苏联先进的教学方法。苏联专家们在各方面都帮助我们改进了工作。
    学习俄文运动已在全国各地广泛地开展起来，参加到这个运动中来的科学家、教师、文艺工作者、工程师、学生和国家机关的工作人员的人数正日益增加。在“中苏友好月”里，各地更掀起了学习俄文的热潮。这个学习俄文的热潮说明了中国人民热望学习苏联，说明了中国人民热爱苏联人民、热爱斯大林同志。这是中国人民对于苏联人民深厚友情的表现。
    我们虽然在学习俄文方面已经取得许多成绩，但在俄文教学工作中还存在着不少缺点。例如：到现在为止我们还没有合适的良好的俄文教材；我们的翻译人员和俄文师资无论在质量上和数量上还远远落后于国家的需要；我们还缺乏必要的工具书和教学参考材料，我们还没有很好地从过去的工作中总结出成熟的经验来加以推广等等。这些情况都说明放在我们面前的任务是很艰巨的，我们应该以更大的努力来继续加强对俄文教学工作的领导。
