The arch-murderer Clark, who slaughtered prisoners of war, still attempts to deny the grave crimes of the U.S. military in Korea in violating the Geneva Convention. He brazenly describes the bloody massacres and maltreatment of prisoners of war that occurred frequently in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps as "giving prisoners of war proper and humane treatment." He even resorts to rogue tactics, making counter-accusations, demanding that prisoners of war who were brutally murdered for opposing forced retention "respect their obligations under the Geneva Convention." However, Clark's shameless sophistry to deceive world public opinion cannot cover up the U.S. aggressors' numerous crimes. The U.S. aggressors' own admitted facts fully prove that the U.S. aggressors have thoroughly violated the Geneva Convention, which it once signed.

Article 1 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances." In order to clarify the responsibility for the treatment of prisoners of war, Article 12 of the Geneva Convention further stipulates: "Prisoners of war are in the hands of the enemy Power, but not of the individuals or military units who have captured them. Irrespective of the individual responsibilities that may exist, the Detaining Power is responsible for the treatment given them." The Geneva Convention also specifically laid down a provision in Article 7 to guarantee the rights of prisoners of war, which is: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention…" However, the U.S. aggressors completely violated these provisions. They almost violated every basic clause of the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, and deprived prisoners of war of all the treatment and rights they should enjoy.

The U.S. aggressors first violated Article 4 of the Geneva Convention regarding the definition of prisoners of war, forcibly categorizing prisoners of war as "detained civilians" in order to retain them. The International Committee of the Red Cross has already acknowledged this in its various reports. The Committee's report on the February 18th massacre revealed that the U.S. side, at the request of Syngman Rhee, categorized all prisoners of war in Camp No. 62 as "detained civilians." The Committee's most recent report to our side also acknowledged that over 30,000 prisoners of war in Camp No. 6 on Geoje Island, who were forcibly categorized as "detained civilians," strongly "protested against the measure of changing the status of prisoners of war in Camp No. 6," because the prisoner-of-war camp authorities "had decided that these detained civilians would return to South Korea."

In order to forcibly retain prisoners of war, the U.S. aggressors viciously violated Article 13 of the Geneva Convention. This article stipulates: "Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of war may be subjected to any medical experiment or scientific experiment not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest." However, in this year alone, even according to the U.S. side's own admitted figures and the reports of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the U.S. side has already killed and wounded more than 3,000 prisoners of war. In order to create pretexts for retaining prisoners of war, the U.S. side forced prisoners of war to tattoo themselves and write blood letters. U.S. special agents even knocked prisoners of war unconscious and used their own fingers to dip into the blood of the prisoners of war to stamp the blood letters. The U.S. side imposed cruel torture and punishment on those prisoners of war who resisted this inhuman persecution. The United Press reported on January 20th of this year that "in the officers' detention camp, a plain-spoken Communist was hung up and beaten unconscious." The next day, "he and fifteen other companions" were transferred to another place, which the United Press said "was specially prepared for some stubborn Communists." The United Press admitted that "the center of the concentration camp has become an island of terror," "torture and assassination are woven into a terrifying picture in the daily life of prisoners of war." U.S. General Colson, who once served as the commander of a U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, also admitted in his letter to our captured personnel: "I certainly admit that there have been bloody incidents, resulting in many prisoners of war being killed or wounded by United Nations troops." He guaranteed that "in the future, prisoners of war in this prisoner-of-war camp can hope to receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law." However, immediately after Colson made this guarantee, the U.S. aggressors immediately overturned their promise and further violated Article 13 of the Geneva Convention regarding "Reprisals against prisoners of war are prohibited," and took large-scale retaliatory actions against prisoners of war. Under the command of the executioner Boatner, a series of armed provocations and bloody massacres were carried out on Geoje Island. In just one "major suppression operation" on June 10th, the U.S. side killed and wounded more than 160 of our captured personnel.

What is particularly outrageous is that the U.S. side actually used prisoners of war for experiments with bacteriological weapons and atomic weapons. An Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on May 18 admitted that a U.S. landing craft No. 1091 was "permanently anchored" off the coast of Geoje Island. The laboratory on this ship "obtained cultures of oral and intestinal germs from patients in the prisoner-of-war camps stretched out on Geoje Island, and conducted 3,000 tests every day." Recently captured U.S. secret documents also revealed that the U.S. side had transported 1,400 prisoners of war to the United States for experiments with atomic weapons, and 800 prisoners of war were burned alive by the U.S. side while testing new flamethrowers. Ridgway admitted while testifying before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S. side was prepared "to send 50,000 or 60,000 stubborn Communist prisoners of war to the Mariana Islands or Saipan, or even to the United States." The U.S. aggressors clearly attempted to use this large number of prisoners of war for inhuman experiments.

At the same time, the U.S. aggressors also violated Article 14 of the Convention. This article stipulates: "Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honour. Women shall be treated with all the regard due to their sex and shall in all cases benefit by treatment as favourable as that granted to men." Obviously, under the circumstances where the U.S. side can arbitrarily massacre and persecute prisoners of war, any respect for the "persons and their honour" of prisoners of war is out of the question. And for women, the U.S. side even more shamelessly persecutes and insults them. The International Committee of the Red Cross admitted in its recent report to our side that U.S. soldiers frequently broke into female prisoner-of-war camps to commit rape, and under the pretext of searching, stripped female prisoners of war naked and insulted them. Many U.S. magazines have published photos of such insults to women.

Article 16 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "All prisoners of war shall be treated alike by the Detaining Power, …without any adverse distinction based on race, nationality, religious belief or political opinions, or any other distinction founded on similar criteria." However, the U.S. aggressors cruelly persecuted prisoners of war who adhered to their political beliefs. Boatner once openly admitted how he persecuted prisoners of war. He said in San Antonio in September, "If you see a fanatical Communist, and you put a pair of fire tongs or a gun behind him, he will be immediately startled and express himself even more fanatically." And this cruel and ruthless executioner has repeatedly declared that he is abiding by the Geneva Convention!

The so-called "screening" of prisoners of war by the U.S. aggressors is also a completely illegal act in violation of the Geneva Convention. Article 17 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Every prisoner of war, when questioned, is bound to give only his surname, first names and rank, date of birth, and army, regimental, personal or serial number, or failing this, equivalent information." This article also stipulates:

"No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." However, the U.S. aggressors used unprecedentedly cruel massacres and insults to conduct illegal political "screening" of prisoners of war, forcing prisoners of war to make political promises to betray their motherland. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett recently publicly admitted that "Allied propagandists" "persuaded" prisoners of war to betray their motherland. The June 2nd issue of the U.S. "Time" magazine revealed that the U.S. side shot dead prisoners of war who expressed their willingness to be repatriated on the spot during the "screening." U.S. General Colson also admitted that the U.S. side "forcibly screened" and "re-armed" prisoners of war. The U.S. side also admitted that on April 10th, it killed and wounded more than 60 prisoners of war because of the forced "screening." The U.S. side also frequently interrogated prisoners of war with torture. The International Committee of the Red Cross admitted in its recent report to our side that in every camp, captured officers and soldiers accused of being tortured during interrogation. A representative of the Committee admitted that he personally saw a prisoner of war being brutally beaten during interrogation.

Article 21 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "The Detaining Power may subject prisoners of war to confinement. It may order them not to go beyond certain limits of the camp; if the camp is fenced, they may not go outside the enclosure." However, the U.S. side now divides the kitchen into a "restricted area" in the prisoner-of-war camps surrounded by barbed wire, does not allow prisoners of war to move freely in the camp, and arbitrarily kills prisoners of war under the pretext that prisoners of war have entered the "restricted area."

Article 21 also stipulates: "Prisoners of war may be partially or wholly released on parole or promise, in so far as is compatible with the laws of the Power on which they depend. …No prisoner of war shall be compelled to accept parole or promise of release." There are no such legal provisions on the Korean and Chinese side, but the U.S. side has unilaterally transferred 38,000 prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang under the name of "release," forcing them to serve as cannon fodder for the war of aggression.

The U.S. aggressors also mistreat prisoners of war in terms of living conditions. Article 25 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Living quarters for prisoners of war shall be as good as those provided for their own troops quartered in the same area. … The foregoing rules shall apply in particular to the dormitories used by prisoners of war, as regards both total surface and minimum cubic space, as well as to general fittings, bedding and blankets, etc." This article also stipulates that prisoner-of-war housing "shall be adequately heated and lighted, especially between dusk and lights out." However, the International Committee of the Red Cross admitted in its report on the February 18th massacre that in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, "dormitories - tents and barracks are generally overcrowded"; "the number of straw mats is insufficient, and they are all bad"; "lighting is poor."

Article 26 of the Geneva Convention stipulates that "The basic daily food rations shall be sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to keep prisoners of war in good health and to prevent loss of weight or the development of nutritional deficiencies." However, the aforementioned report of the International Committee of the Red Cross admitted that in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, the prisoners of war "expressed dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of food," and "many people suffer from gastrointestinal diseases."

Article 26 also specifically stipulates: "Collective disciplinary measures affecting food are prohibited." However, the U.S. aggressors often use the shameless means of cutting off the food supply to prisoners of war to persecute them. The International Committee of the Red Cross revealed in its recent report to our side that the U.S. side cut off food supplies to Camp No. 66 on Geoje Island. The Committee recently revealed that the U.S. side did not provide food and drink to sick prisoners of war in three hospital camps in April this year. Clark now admits that this was done to force them to accept the fate of being retained. In May, the U.S. side also cut off food supplies to 8,000 wounded and sick prisoners of war in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp for as long as nine days from May 12. Since this still failed to force the prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation," the U.S. side carried out a massacre on them on May 20. In early June, when the U.S. side re-conducted illegal "screening" of prisoners of war on Geoje Island, it also adopted this brutal measure of cutting off food supplies.

Article 27 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Clothing, underwear and footwear shall be issued in sufficient quantities to prisoners of war by the Detaining Power…" However, the International Committee of the Red Cross's report on the February 18th incident admitted that the prisoners of war did not have enough winter clothing, and not enough shoes and socks. Although the prisoner-of-war camp authorities had many shoes and socks in the warehouse, they refused to issue them to the prisoners of war.

The U.S. aggressors are particularly inhuman in their mistreatment of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Article 29 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "The Detaining Power shall be bound to take all sanitary measures necessary to ensure the cleanliness and healthfulness of camps and to prevent epidemics." Article 30 stipulates: "Every prisoner of war camp shall have an adequate infirmary where prisoners of war may have the attention they require, as well as appropriate diet." However, the aforementioned report of the International Committee of the Red Cross admitted that although gastrointestinal diseases were prevalent in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, there was a lack of necessary medicines. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on May 20, our captured personnel working in the U.S. prisoner-of-war hospital on Geoje Island went on a hunger strike to demand improved treatment. U.S. chief medical officer Gillingham revealed that the demands put forward by our captured personnel included improving food, abolishing the system of forcing patients to work, increasing hospital staff, and providing daily necessities. However, the U.S. side rejected these reasonable demands and used force to drive our captured personnel onto trucks and detain them. The female prisoners of war on Geoje Island also protested against the poor medical conditions on May 17, but were also rejected. The recent massacre on Pongam Island once again revealed that in the Pongam Island prisoner-of-war camp, which held nearly 10,000 prisoners of war, there were no medical facilities, and the wounded prisoners of war needed to be sent to Geoje Island for treatment.

The U.S. aggressors fundamentally do not allow prisoners of war to engage in cultural and recreational activities. Article 38 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "While respecting the individual preferences of every prisoner, the Detaining Power shall encourage the practice of intellectual, educational, recreational and sports activities, games and other forms of amusement.… Prisoners of war shall have opportunities for taking physical exercise, including sports, games and out-of-door recreation." However, the U.S. side forced prisoners of war to accept reactionary education under the name of "persuasion," attempting to induce them to betray their motherland, and brutally beat those prisoners of war who were unwilling to receive reactionary education. The U.S. side more often arbitrarily massacres prisoners of war under the pretext that prisoners of war were "singing," "drilling," and "strolling back and forth." For example, on October 26, the U.S. side killed and wounded 76 prisoners of war on Geoje Island under the pretext that the prisoners of war were "going on drill." The U.S. side even does not allow prisoners of war to celebrate their motherland's festivals. According to a recent report to our side by the International Committee of the Red Cross, on August 15 last year, 32 captured Korean People's Army personnel were killed and wounded for celebrating the liberation day of their motherland. On October 1 this year, 165 Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel on Jeju Island were killed and wounded for celebrating their motherland's National Day.

The U.S. aggressors also create pretexts for "prisoner-of-war escapes" to forcibly retain and massacre prisoners of war. Article 42 of the Geneva Convention stipulates, "The use of weapons against prisoners of war, especially against those who are escaping or attempting to escape, shall constitute an extreme measure, which shall always be preceded by warnings appropriate to the circumstances." However, in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, "prisoner-of-war escape" has become a pretext for the U.S. side to kill prisoners of war who refuse to be forcibly retained. In the U.S. vocabulary, the so-called prisoner-of-war "escape" actually means that the prisoner of war has been forcibly retained. Some of the people listed in the prisoner-of-war list submitted by the U.S. side on December 18 last year were missing in the list submitted by the U.S. side on January 28 this year. Under our questioning, the U.S. side said that these people had "escaped" in March or April this year. The prisoners of war whose names had been crossed out by the U.S. side because they already knew in January that they would "escape" in March or April were originally forced by the U.S. side to serve as special agents. Many of them have been airdropped by the U.S. side to our rear and told the truth. And when the detained prisoners of war are killed because they firmly demand repatriation, the U.S. side lies that they were killed because of "escape." However, this pretext still cannot cover up the U.S. side's crimes of violating the Geneva Convention.

The U.S. side also forces prisoners of war to engage in dangerous hard labor. Article 50 of the Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war can only engage in non-military work. Article 52 stipulates, "Unless he be a volunteer, no prisoner of war may be employed on labour which is of an unhealthy or dangerous nature." Article 53 stipulates, "The working hours of prisoners of war, including the time spent in going to and returning from work, shall not be excessive, and shall in no case exceed those permitted for civilian workers of the Detaining Power in the same district, employed on the same tasks." However, the U.S. aggressors force prisoners of war to engage in dangerous hard labor, forcing them to build military roads and docks. Boatner admitted in a speech in San Antonio that the U.S. side formed prisoners of war into "labor camps," forcing them to "work with all their strength," attempting to torture them with hard labor. On August 24, at the U.S. Masan prisoner-of-war camp, a prisoner of war was killed by falling rocks while engaging in dangerous labor.

The U.S. aggressors also arbitrarily arrest prisoner-of-war representatives. Article 80 of the Geneva Convention stipulates, "Prisoners of war shall not be held responsible collectively for any misdeed, act of insubordination, or offence committed by individual prisoners of war." However, the International Committee of the Red Cross admitted in its recent report to our side that prisoner-of-war representatives are frequently arrested by the U.S. side and locked up for secret interrogation. After the large-scale massacre of prisoners of war on Geoje Island on June 10, in order to evade responsibility, the U.S. side arrested 16 to 18 of our captured personnel and sent them to U.S. military intelligence agencies for interrogation, including three women. According to U.S. news agencies, these people were the prisoner-of-war representatives selected by various camps during the Dodd incident, and they were recognized by the then prisoner-of-war camp commander Colson. This atrocity by the U.S. side also directly violates Articles 84 and 99 of the Geneva Convention. Article 84 stipulates, "Prisoners of war shall be tried only by a military court." Article 99 stipulates, "No prisoner of war may be compelled to admit his guilt to the act of which he is accused, nor may any pressure be brought to bear on him, either mental or physical." However, the U.S. side's purpose in handing over prisoners of war to U.S. military intelligence agencies, known for their Hitler-like cruelty, for interrogation is clearly to massacre them.

The U.S. aggressors also often kill and wound prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called prisoners of war "disobeying orders," but this pretext itself is in violation of the Geneva Convention. Article 89 of the Convention stipulates: "Disciplinary punishments shall in no case be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to the health of prisoners of war." What's more, the U.S. side's so-called "orders" are actually to force prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation." When announcing this pretext for massacring prisoners of war, the U.S. side never dares to say what kind of orders the prisoners of war are resisting. This shows how guilty the U.S. aggressors are.

In order to achieve the goal of forcibly retaining prisoners of war and undermining the truce negotiations, in addition to committing the inhuman crimes of violating the aforementioned articles of the Geneva Convention, the U.S. side also particularly grossly violated Articles 118 and 119 of the Geneva Convention. Article 118 stipulates, "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." Article 119 specifically stipulates the details of the repatriation procedure. However, from the very beginning of the discussion on the issue of prisoners of war in the truce negotiations, the U.S. side put forward proposals such as "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation," which are completely contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Convention, attempting to retain a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for the war of aggression. After these proposals were refuted by the Korean and Chinese side with facts and reason, the U.S. side had no choice but to agree to stipulate in Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Convention: "All prisoners of war held by both sides at the time of the entry into effect of this Armistice Agreement shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as possible." However, the U.S. side immediately refused to implement this agreement, put forward absurd repatriation figures, and always refused to abandon its shameless intention to retain prisoners of war. Finally, the U.S. side rebranded the so-called "voluntary repatriation" into the so-called "non-forcible repatriation," which is also a violation of the Geneva Convention, and used the Indian proposal at the UN General Assembly to force other countries to accept this absurd "principle," attempting to use this to evade responsibility for undermining the truce negotiations and open the door to continuing and expanding the war of aggression. Almost all of the aforementioned facts were provided by the U.S. side or the International Committee of the Red Cross. They irrefutably prove that the U.S. aggressors have consistently violated international conventions, deliberately destroyed humanitarian principles, and systematically used murderous means to forcibly retain prisoners of war in order to undermine negotiations and prolong and expand the war. Peace-loving people all over the world will resolutely not tolerate such heinous crimes and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. With the strong support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean and Chinese people will fight to the end to shatter this evil conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

    美国侵略者破坏日内瓦公约的严重罪行
    屠杀战俘的大凶手克拉克直到现在都还企图狡赖美军在朝鲜破坏日内瓦公约的严重罪行。他居然把在美方战俘营中层出不穷的屠杀和虐待战俘的血腥事件，说成是“给战俘以正当的、人道的待遇”。他甚至耍起无赖手段，反咬一口，要因为反对强迫扣留而遭受野蛮杀害的战俘“尊重他们在日内瓦公约规定下的义务”。但是克拉克这种欺骗世界舆论的无耻诡辩，是掩饰不了美国侵略者的累累罪行的。美国侵略者自己承认了的一部分事实就完全证明：美国侵略者已经彻底破坏了它曾经签字的日内瓦公约。
    日内瓦公约第一条规定：“各缔约国承诺，在一切情况下尊重本公约并保证本公约之被尊重。”为了明确关于战俘待遇的责任，日内瓦公约第十二条并规定，“战俘系在敌国国家手中，而非在俘获彼等之个人或军事单位之手中。不论个人之责任如何，拘留国对战俘所受之待遇应负责任。”日内瓦公约还特地在第七条中定下了保障战俘权利的条文，这就是：“在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约……所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部。”但是美国侵略者却完全违反了这几条规定，它几乎破坏了日内瓦公约中有关战俘待遇的每一项基本条款，并且剥夺了战俘应该享受的一切待遇和权利。
    美国侵略者首先破坏了日内瓦公约第四条关于战俘定义的规定，硬将战俘列为“被拘平民”，以便加以扣留。红十字国际委员会在其历次报告中都已经承认了这一点。该委员会关于二月十八日屠杀事件的报告中透露，美方根据李承晚的要求，将第六十二号营场的战俘全部列为“被拘平民”。该委员会最近交给我方的报告书中也承认：巨济岛第六营区的三万多被硬列为“被拘平民”的战俘，强烈地“抗议改变第六营区战俘身份的措施”，因为战俘营当局“已决定这些被拘平民回到南朝鲜去”。
    美国侵略者为了强迫扣留战俘，穷凶极恶地破坏了日内瓦公约第十三条。这一条规定，“战俘在任何时须受人道之待遇。拘留国任何不法行为或不行为可致其看管中之战俘死亡或严重危害其健康者须予禁止，并当视为严重破坏本公约之行为。尤其不得对战俘加以肢体残伤，或供任何医学或科学试验而非为有关战俘之医疗治牙，或住院诊疗所应有且为其本身利益而施行者。”但是仅仅在今年一年之中，即使根据美方自己承认的数字和红十字国际委员会的报告，美方就已经打死打伤了三千多名战俘。美方为了制造扣留战俘的藉口，强迫战俘在身上刺字，写血书，美方的特务甚至将战俘打昏以后用自己的手指蘸着战俘的血在血书上盖印。对于那些反抗这种非人道迫害的战俘，美方就加以残酷的拷打和刑罚。合众社在今年一月二十日报道说，“在军官的拘留营内，一个说话直率的共产党人，被吊起来打得人事不知。”第二天，“他和另外十五个同伴”就被调到另一个处所，合众社说，“那是专为一些顽固不化的共产党人预备的。”合众社承认，“集中营中心变成了一个恐怖之岛”，“酷刑、暗杀在战俘日常生活中交织成一幅恐怖的图画”。曾经当过美方战俘营司令的美国将军柯尔生，在他给我方被俘人员的信中也承认：“我肯定承认有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或打伤。”他保证“将来这个战俘营里的战俘可以希望得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇”。可是在柯尔生作了这个保证以后，美国侵略者立刻推翻诺言，进一步破坏日内瓦公约第十三条关于“对战俘之报复措施应予禁止”的规定，对战俘采取了大规模的报复行动。在刽子手波纳指挥之下，在巨济岛上进行了一系列的武装挑衅和血腥屠杀。仅仅在六月十日的一次“大弹压行动”中，美方就打死打伤了我方被俘人员一百六十多人。
    尤其令人发指的是美方竟然将战俘用作细菌武器的实验和原子武器的实验。美联社巨济岛五月十八日电承认，有一艘美国的一○九一号登陆艇，“一直停泊在”巨济岛畔。这个船上的实验室“从伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营的病人那里取得口与肠的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验”。最近缴获的美方秘密文件还透露了：美方曾经将一千四百名战俘运往美国用作原子武器的实验，有八百名战俘被美方在试验新式的喷火器时活活烧死。李奇微在美国参议院军事委员会作证时，承认美方准备“把五万或六万顽强的共产党战俘送到马利安纳群岛或塞班岛，或者甚至送到美国去”。美国侵略者显然企图把这一大批战俘用来作惨无人道的实验。
    美国侵略者同时还破坏了公约第十四条。这一条规定：“战俘在一切情况下应享受人身及荣誉之尊重。对于妇女之待遇应充分顾及其性别，并在一切场合彼等应享受与男子同等之待遇。”很明显，在美方可以任意屠杀迫害战俘的情况下，对战俘的任何“人身及荣誉”的尊重都是谈不上的。而对于妇女，美方更是无耻地加以迫害和侮辱。红十字国际委员会在其最近给我方的报告中承认，美国士兵经常闯入女战俘营进行强奸，并藉口搜查，脱光女战俘的衣服加以侮辱。在美国的许多杂志上就刊载了这种侮辱妇女的照片。
    日内瓦公约第十六条规定：“拘留国对于所有战俘，……应同样待遇之，不得基于种族、国籍、宗教信仰、或政治意见，或根据类似标准之任何其他区别而有所歧视。”但是美国侵略者却对坚持自己的政治信仰的战俘加以残酷的迫害。波纳就曾经公开承认过他是怎样迫害战俘的。他在九月间在圣安东尼奥说，“假使你看到了一个狂热的共产党人，而你把一把火钳或一支枪挺在他背后的话，他会立刻大吃一惊，而且表示得更狂热。”而这个残忍狠恶的刽子手还曾经一再宣称他是遵守日内瓦公约的呢！
    美国侵略者对战俘进行的所谓“甄别”，也完全是破坏日内瓦公约的非法行为。日内瓦公约第十七条规定：“每一战俘，当其受讯问时，仅须告以其姓名、等级、出生日期，及军、团、个人番号，如其不能，则提供相当之材料。”这一条还规定：
    “对战俘不得施以肉体或精神上之酷刑或任何其他胁迫方式借以自彼等获得任何情报。战俘之拒绝答复者不得加以威胁，侮辱，或使之受任何不快或不利之待遇。”而美国侵略者却用空前残酷的屠杀和侮辱手段来对战俘进行非法的政治“甄别”，强迫战俘作背叛祖国的政治诺言。美国国防部长罗维特最近公开承认“联军宣传人员”“劝导”战俘背叛他们的祖国。六月二日的美国“时代”周刊透露，美方在进行“甄别”时把表示愿意遣返的战俘当场打死。美国将军柯尔生也承认美方对战俘“进行强迫甄别”和“重新武装”战俘。美方还承认在四月十日曾经因为进行强迫“甄别”而打死打伤战俘六十人之多。美方并经常以酷刑审讯战俘。红十字国际委员会最近给我方的报告书承认，在每一个营场中，被俘官兵都控诉在受审时遭到酷刑。委员会的一个代表承认，他亲眼看见一名战俘在被审问时遭到毒打。
    日内瓦公约第二十一条规定：“拘留国得将战俘拘禁。得令战俘不得越出拘留营一定界限，若上述拘留营设有围栅，则不得越出围栅范围。”但是美方现在却在四周围着铁丝网的战俘营里，将厨房划为“禁区”，不许战俘在营场内自由行动，并且以战俘进入“禁区”为名任意打死战俘。
    第二十一条还规定：“在战俘所依附之国法律允许下，得将战俘部分或全部依宣誓或诺言释放。……任何战俘不得强令接受宣誓或诺言释放。”朝中方面并无这样的法律规定，但是美方已经片面地将三万八千名战俘以“释放”为名，移交给了李承晚匪帮，强迫他们充当侵略战争的炮灰。
    美国侵略者还在生活上虐待战俘。日内瓦公约第二十五条规定：“战俘住宿之条件应与在同一区域内拘留国驻扎之部队居住之条件同样优良。……上述规定尤应适用于战俘之宿舍，如关于总面积与最低限度之立方空间，及一般设备、垫褥、被毯等。”这一条还规定战俘住所“应有充足之温度与光线，特别是在黄昏与熄灯之时间内。”但是红十字国际委员会在其关于二月十八日屠杀事件的报告中承认，在美方战俘营中，“宿舍——帐幕和营房一般地是住的人数过多”；“草垫的数量不足，并且都是坏的”；“灯光不良”。
    日内瓦公约第二十六条规定，“每日基本口粮在量，质，与种类上应足够保持战俘之健康及防止体重减轻或营养不足。”但是上述红十字国际委员会的报告书却承认，在美方战俘营中，战俘们“对于伙食的质和量表示不满”，“患肠胃病的人很多”。
    第二十六条还特别规定：“饮食上的集体处罚措施应予禁止。”但是美国侵略者却经常用断绝战俘食粮的无耻手段来迫害战俘。红十字国际委员会最近给我方的报告书中透露，美方曾对巨济岛上六十六号营场断绝食粮供应。该委员会最近又透露，美方在今年四月间曾经不给三个病院营场中的生病的战俘们以饮食。克拉克现在承认，这样做是为了逼迫他们服从被扣留的命运。在五月间，美方也曾从五月十二日起对釜山战俘营中的八千名伤病战俘断绝伙食达九天之久，由于这样仍然不能强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”，美方就在五月二十日对他们进行了大屠杀。在六月初，当美方对巨济岛上的战俘重新进行非法“甄别”时，也采取了这种断绝口粮的残暴措施。
    日内瓦公约第二十七条规定：“服装、内衣、及鞋袜应由拘留国充分供给战俘……。”但是红十字国际委员会关于二月十八日事件的报告承认，战俘们的冬衣不够，鞋袜不够。战俘营当局虽然有许多鞋袜存在仓库里，却不肯发给战俘穿用。
    美国侵略者特别惨无人道地虐待生病和受伤的战俘。日内瓦公约第二十九条规定：“拘留国应负责采取保证战俘营清洁卫生及防止传染病所必要之卫生措施。”第三十条规定：“每一战俘营内应设有适当之医疗所，俾战俘可获得所需之照顾与适当之饮食。”可是前述红十字国际委员会的报告承认，虽然美方战俘营中肠胃病流行，却缺乏必要的药品。据美联社巨济岛五月二十日电透露，在巨济岛美方战俘医院中工作的我方被俘人员举行绝食，要求改善待遇。美方主任医官吉林格尔透露，我方被俘人员提出的要求中包括改善伙食、取消迫令病人工作的制度、增加医院工作人员，供给生活上的必需品等。但是美方拒绝了这些合理要求，将我方被俘人员用武力赶上卡车，加以拘留。巨济岛上的女战俘也在五月十七日对恶劣的医疗条件提出抗议，但也遭到拒绝。最近蜂岩岛的屠杀事件又暴露了：在收容近万名战俘的蜂岩岛战俘营中，竟然没有医疗设备，被打伤的战俘需要送到巨济岛上去医治。
    美国侵略者根本不容许战俘从事文化娱乐活动。日内瓦公约第三十八条规定：“拘留国应在尊重战俘个人兴趣之条件下，鼓励战俘之文化、教育、及娱乐、运动与游戏活动。……战俘应有作健身活动之机会，包括运动、游戏及户外停留。”但是美方却以“劝导”为名强迫战俘接受反动教育，企图诱使他们背叛祖国，并对那些不愿受反动教育的战俘加以非刑毒打。美方更经常以战俘“唱歌”、“操练”、“来回蹓躂”为罪名来任意屠杀战俘。例如，十月二十六日，美方就以战俘“上操”为藉口，在巨济岛上打死打伤战俘七十六名。美方甚至不许战俘庆祝他们祖国的节日。据红十字国际委员会最近给我方的报告书透露，在去年八月十五日，就有三十二名朝鲜人民军被俘人员因为庆祝祖国解放日而被打死打伤。在今年十月一日，济州岛上的中国人民志愿军被俘人员因为庆祝祖国国庆节而被打死打伤一百六十五人之多。
    美国侵略者还制造“战俘逃亡”的藉口来强迫扣留和屠杀战俘。日内瓦公约第四十二条规定，“对战俘，尤其对脱逃或企图脱逃之战俘，使用武器，应属最后之手段，并应每次先予以适合于当时情况之警告。”但是在美方战俘营中，“战俘逃亡”已经成为美方杀害拒绝被强迫扣留的战俘的藉口。在美方的语汇中，所谓战俘“逃亡”，实际上就是表示这名战俘已被强迫扣留。列入在美方去年十二月十八日交来的战俘名单中的一些人，在今年一月二十八日美方交来的名单中却不见了。在我方追问之下，美方竟说这些人已在今年三月或四月中“逃亡”。美方在一月份就已经知道他们要在三、四月里“逃亡”而把他们的名字钩掉了的战俘，原来都被美方强迫充当了特务。他们之中的不少人已经被美方空投到了我方后方，道出了真情。而当被扣留的战俘因为坚决要求遣返而被杀害的时候，美方就谎称他们是因为“逃亡”而被杀死的。但是这种藉口仍然丝毫不能掩饰美方破坏日内瓦公约的罪行。
    美方还强迫战俘从事危险的苦工。日内瓦公约第五十条规定，战俘仅能从事非军事性的工作。第五十二条规定，“战俘除自愿者外，不得使其从事有害健康或危险性之劳动。”第五十三条规定，“战俘每日劳动时间，包括往返路程之时间，不应过度，绝不得超过拘留国本国普通工人在该区从事同样工作者所许可之时间。”但是美国侵略者却强迫战俘从事危险的苦役，强迫他们修筑军用道路和码头。波纳在圣安东尼奥发表的谈话中承认美方将战俘编成“工作营”，强迫他们“全力工作”，企图用苦役来折磨他们。八月二十四日，在美方的马山战俘营，就有一名战俘因为从事危险的劳动而被落下的岩石打死。
    美国侵略者还任意逮捕战俘代表。日内瓦公约第八十条规定，“战俘代表不得因其任务关系而使之对于战俘所为之任何过犯负责任。”但是红十字国际委员会最近给我方的报告书中承认，战俘代表经常被美方逮捕，并被禁闭起来进行秘密审问。美方在六月十日在巨济岛上大规模屠杀战俘以后，为了推卸责任，竟逮捕了十六名到十八名我方被俘人员，送给美军情报机关审问，其中有三名妇女。据美国通讯社报道，这些人就是在杜德事件发生时由各营场选派出来的战俘代表，他们是得到当时战俘营司令柯尔生的承认的。美方这种暴行，还直接违反了日内瓦公约第八十四条和九十九条。第八十四条规定，“战俘应只由军事法庭审讯”。第九十九条规定，“对战俘不得加以精神或身体上之胁迫，使之对其所被控之行为自认有罪。”而美方将战俘交给以希特勒式的残暴闻名的美军情报机关审问，其目的显然是为了屠杀他们。
    美国侵略者还经常以所谓战俘“违抗命令”为藉口打死打伤战俘，但是这种藉口本身就是违反日内瓦公约的。公约第八十九条规定：“纪律性处罚绝不得非人道、残暴，或危害战俘健康。”更何况美方的所谓“命令”，实际上就是要强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”。美方在宣布这种屠杀战俘的藉口时，从来不敢说出战俘抗拒的是何等样的命令。这就说明了美国侵略者是多么作贼心虚。
    美方为了达到强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战谈判的目的，除了犯了破坏日内瓦公约上述各条的非人道罪行而外，还特别粗暴地破坏了日内瓦公约第一百十八条和一百十九条，第一百十八条规定：“实际战事终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。”第一百十九条具体规定关于遣返程序的细则。但是美方却从停战谈判有关战俘问题的讨论一开始，就提出“一对一交换”、“自愿遣返”等等和日内瓦公约的规定完全相违背的主张，企图扣留大批朝中战俘充当侵略战争的炮灰。当这些主张被朝中方面根据事实与法理驳斥得体无完肤以后，美方只好同意在停战协定草案第五十一款中按照日内瓦公约精神规定：“本停战协定生效时各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。”但是美方随即拒绝执行这项协议，提出荒谬绝伦的遣俘数字，始终不肯放弃扣留战俘的无耻意图。最后美方又将所谓“自愿遣返”改头换面，变成同样违反日内瓦公约的所谓
    “不强迫遣返”，并在联合国大会上利用印度提案，迫使其他国家接受了这个荒谬“原则”，企图借此推卸破坏停战谈判的责任，开辟继续和扩大侵略战争的大门。上述事实几乎全部都是由美国方面或红十字国际委员会所提供的。它们铁一样地证明美国侵略者一贯破坏国际公约，有意摧毁人道原则，有计划地使用残杀手段来强迫扣留战俘以便破坏谈判，延长并扩大战争。对于美帝国主义者这种穷凶极恶的罪行和阴谋，全世界爱好和平人民是坚决不能容忍的。朝中人民必将在世界爱好和平人民的有力支持之下，为粉碎美帝国主义者这种罪恶阴谋而斗争到底。
