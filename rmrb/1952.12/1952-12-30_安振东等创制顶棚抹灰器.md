	An Zhendong and Others Create Ceiling Plastering Device
	To the Editor: In the final stage of construction by the Xijiao Construction Site of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, the ceiling plastering was difficult, the work efficiency was very low, and the task could not be completed. At this time, workers An Zhendong and others began to study the ceiling plastering device. After research, they first conducted experiments in the Tian Peifen Advanced Work Group. Within a few minutes, everyone learned how to operate it. This ceiling plastering device has three characteristics: 1. Originally, white ash had to be applied twice, but now the new tool can do it in one go; 2. It saves skilled workers, because ordinary workers can also operate it; 3. It is not overly tiring and can also ensure good quality. During the experiment, the Tian Peifen group used the new tool for assembly line operation. After three days, working six hours a day, they could plaster 420 square meters. Currently, they can plaster about 500 square meters per day. The organization of the Tian Peifen group is: two ordinary workers push the hopper, two Grade C technicians level and smooth, and one Grade B technician trims the edges, for a total of five workers.

    安振东等创制顶棚抹灰器
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局北京分局西郊施工所在施工的最后阶段，由于顶棚抹灰困难，工作效率很低，不能完成任务。这时工人安振东等便开始研究顶棚抹灰器，研究之后，首先在田培芬先进工作小组进行试验，在几分钟内，大家就学会了他的操作法。这个顶棚抹灰器的特点有三：一、原来上白灰，要上两次，现在用新工具一次即成；二、节省技工，因为普通工人也可以操作；三、不会过分劳累，还能搞好质量。在进行试验时，田培芬小组用新工具流水操作，三天后，每日工作六小时，就可抹四百二十方公尺，目前每天能抹五百方公尺左右。田培芬小组的组织是：两个普通工人推合子，两个丙级技工找平压平，一个乙级技工修边，总共五人劳动。　陈耀南　张海清
