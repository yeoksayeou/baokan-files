    We met Cherkasov, the Soviet People's Artist, who is well-known and loved by us and the Chinese audience. He is a veteran who has devoted himself to the Soviet people's drama and film industry for thirty-three years. The Soviet people love the high ideological content of Cherkasov's creations and his artistic genius. He has been awarded the Stalin Prize five times, the Order of Lenin twice, and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor once. The Soviet people also awarded him the honorary title of Soviet People's Artist.

    His outstanding acting work is combined with extensive social activities. In 1950, he was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He enthusiastically engages in artistic creation and tirelessly pursues social activities.

    In his thirty years of creative activity, he has played dozens of roles, both large and small, including workers, peasants, naval soldiers, infantrymen, scientists, critics, and ancient Russian emperors and princes. Each character he portrays has distinct personality traits, and the inner activities of the characters and the delicate expressions of the exterior are highly unified, giving the audience an unforgettable impression. In the Soviet film "Baltic Deputy," Cherkasov very profoundly expresses the complex feelings of Professor Polezhayev. He artistically reproduced the true image of the Soviet scholar Timiryazev on the screen. In the film "Peter the Great," he played Prince Alexei, powerfully portraying a treacherous political traitor, a despicable, hypocritical, and lying figure. In the film "Lenin in 1918," he excellently played Gorky. In the film "Alexander Nevsky," he portrayed the character of a famous Russian general – the brave, intelligent, and visionary statesman Alexander Nevsky – very profoundly. In the film "The Ingenious Inventor," Cherkasov once again successfully created the vivid image of the Russian scholar – the radio inventor Popov. Through the image of this humble, reserved, and taciturn scholar, Cherkasov brilliantly expressed the lofty aspirations, profound thoughts, and noble qualities of this great Russian patriot. He has also successfully played many other roles. When talking about why he was able to successfully create so many roles, he said: "We must be loyal and love the cause, and have unwavering confidence and determination to fight for life." These are the words that Cherkasov has verified from his own tireless work.

    Cherkasov believes that: "Actors must observe life and experience life like writers, musicians, and sculptors. No artist can create in a room based on fantasy. Any character is expressed in communication, life, action, and struggle; it is difficult to know the personality of a sleeping person. Only when he wakes up and begins to fight for a certain purpose can we know his personality. If an artist sits at home and does not go into real life, he will gain nothing."

    He talked to us about stage performance. He said that stage performance has different effects because the audience is different each time, the level is uneven, and the number of people is different, so actors can have new creations for the role in each performance. An actor should constantly discover new things in the performance.

    He performed the stage classic "Ivan the Terrible" 238 times in the Soviet Union, and each time he performed the scene where Ivan personally killed his son, it was a success. "What did Stanislavsky teach us?" Cherkasov said, "That is, each of us actors should forget how we performed last time. Every time I kill my son, it is sudden and unexpected, every time the language, actions, etc. are the first time; every performance must be able to express fresh inner feelings, this is true art. However, some actors answer a sentence when someone reads it, and even answer it indifferently, which hinders the creation of the role." He said that in "Ivan the Terrible," there is a scene where his monologue lasts for sixteen minutes, and it is difficult to handle the scene where the audience understands the development of the plot through the monologue. He and the director studied this monologue and divided it into six units. He spared no effort and painstakingly researched and explored it. After a long period of rehearsal, he, as an actor, was confident that he could perform it. However, he was truly able to handle the role after fifty-three performances. By the one hundredth performance of this scene, he had improved, and it was even better when he performed it two hundred times.

    This is artistic creation that has been tempered and reached perfection. This is something that cannot be achieved without the hard work of "grinding an iron bar into a needle."

    When talking about film performance, Cherkasov used the filming of the scene in the lower part of "Peter the Great" where the prince beats his lover as an example: This scene was filmed over several months. The actor needs to continue the mood of several months ago. If the actor's mood is expressed too high or too low once, it will not be connected before and after. This requires the actor to perform just right, so that each scene is connected like blood vessels, becoming an organic thing. The play performed by a film actor is like a person's body divided into several pieces, which are then combined into a whole. This can only be achieved through continuous practice, experience, re-practice, and re-experience by the actor. Film has many requirements for actors, such as photography, recording, lighting, etc., which all put different technical requirements on the actor. However, actors cannot focus only on technology, because that will hinder the creation of the soul. And whether on stage or in film, the actor's closest person is the director; no matter how talented the actor is, he cannot leave the director. Actors love directors, and directors love actors. Only such love and sincere cooperation can produce healthy children (roles).

    The topic turned to playing the image of the leader. He said: "We are very fortunate to be born in the era of Lenin and Stalin and become actors who fight for peace. The images of Lenin and Stalin have been successfully created in Soviet films. We also hope that the image of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, can appear on the Chinese screen as soon as possible."

    Talking about the problem of creating characters in biographical dramas and movies, he said: "We create an image, not a photo. The most important thing is not to require absolute similarity in appearance. First of all, we must be able to portray the essence of the character and concretely express the character's ideological activities. The Soviet actors Glovanie and Jiji both played Stalin, but in appearance, in some places, they are not exactly the same. Pavlov's students wrote to say: Pavlov on the screen is very good, but not exactly the same as the original Pavlov. Our answer is: the most important thing is not the appearance, but to express his ideological essence. Because art is for the majority of people, not just for Pavlov's students. Therefore, when we play great figures, don't simply pay attention to whether the appearance is similar or not, but express the essence of their great thoughts through their lives, work, words, and deeds."

    苏联人民演员契尔卡索夫
    陈戈
    我们和中国观众所熟识、所热爱的苏联人民演员契尔卡索夫会面了。这是一位献身苏联人民戏剧、电影事业三十三年的老战士。苏联人民热爱契尔卡索夫的创作的高度思想性，热爱他的艺术天才。他曾荣获五次斯大林奖金、两次列宁勋章和一次劳动红旗勋章，苏联人民并授给他苏联人民演员的光荣称号。
    他的杰出的演员工作和广泛的社会活动相结合。一九五○年他被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。他热情地从事艺术创作，并不倦地从事社会活动。
    他在三十几年的创作活动中，曾扮演过数十个大小角色，演过工人、农民、海军士兵、步兵、科学家、批评家、俄国古代的皇帝和王子。他所饰演的每一角色，都具有鲜明的性格特征，人物的内心活动和外部的细致表情达到了高度的统一，给观众以难忘的印象。契尔卡索夫在苏联影片“波罗的海代表”中，非常深刻地表现出波列沙耶夫的复杂的心情。他艺术地把苏联学者蒂米利亚泽夫的真实形象再现于银幕上。在影片“彼得大帝”影片中，他扮演阿列克塞皇子，有力地刻划出包藏祸心的政治叛徒，卑鄙、虚伪、说谎的人物。他在影片“列宁在一九一八”中，出色地扮演了高尔基。他在影片“亚历山大·湼夫斯基”中，把一位俄罗斯名将——英勇、聪明而有远见的政治家亚历山大·湼夫斯基的性格刻划的非常深刻。在影片“天才发明家”中，契尔卡索夫又一次成功地创造了俄罗斯学者——无线电发明家波波夫的鲜明形象。通过这位谦逊、含蓄、不多讲话的学者的形象，契尔卡索夫出色地表现了这位伟大的俄罗斯爱国者的远大志向、深刻的思想和崇高的品质。他还成功地扮演了许多别的角色。他谈到他为什么能成功地创造这么多角色时说：“要对事业忠诚、热爱，而且要有坚毅的信心和终身奋斗的决心。”这是契尔卡索夫从自己孜孜不倦的工作中证实了的话。
    契尔卡索夫认为：“演员必须像文学家，音乐家，雕塑家等一样地去观察生活，体验生活，任何艺术家都不能关在屋子里凭着空想来进行创作。任何性格都表现在交往中，生活中，行动和斗争中；一个睡着的人，就很难知道他是什么性格。只有当他醒了，开始为某一目的斗争时，我们才能知道他的个性。如果艺术家坐在家里，不到实际生活中去，那是什么也得不到的。”
    他对我们谈起舞台表演。他说舞台表演因为每次观众不同，水平不一，人数不等，所以效果也不同，演员在每次演出中都可以对角色有新的创造。一个演员，应该在演出中不断发现新鲜的东西。
    他在苏联上演了二百三十八次舞台古典剧“伊凡雷帝”，当表演伊凡亲手杀死他的儿子那场戏时，每次都获得成功。“史坦尼斯拉夫斯基教给我们什么呢？”契尔卡索夫说，“就是我们每个演员应该忘掉上一次是怎样演出的。我每次打死我儿子，都是突然的，出其不意的，每一次语言、动作等都是第一次；要每一次演出都能表达出新鲜的内在感情，这才是真实的艺术。但是，有的演员是人家读一句，他就答一句，甚至毫不关心的答一句，这样就阻碍了角色的创造。”他说在“伊凡雷帝”中，有一场戏，他的独白有十六分钟之久，要通过独白使观众了解剧情的发展，这是很难处理的场面。他和导演研究这场独白，把这场独白分成六个单位。他费尽了精力，苦心研究、探索。经过长期的排练后，作为演员的他，已经有信心可以演出了。可是，真正能胜任这个角色，是在五十三次演出以后。到第一百次演出这场戏时，他又有所提高，当演二百次时就更好了。
    这是经过千锤百炼，达到了炉火纯青的艺术创造，这是非有“铁棍磨绣针”的艰苦工夫不能达到的。
    谈到电影表演时，契尔卡索夫把“彼得大帝”下集中王子打他爱人时的拍摄工作作为一个例子来说：这场戏是先后经过几个月拍成的。演员需要继续数月前的情绪，假如有一次演员的情绪表现得过高或过低，那就会前后衔接不上。这就要求演员演得恰到好处，使得每一场戏像血管似地联系起来，成为有机的东西。电影演员所演的戏，好比一个人的身体分成好几块，而又合起来成为一个整体，这样只有靠演员不断的实践，体验，再实践，再体验。电影对演员有多方面的要求，如摄影、录音、灯光等，都要对演员提出不同的技术上的要求。但是，演员却不能把注意力仅仅放在技术上去，因为那样，就会妨碍心灵的创造。并且不论在舞台上或电影上，演员最亲密的人是导演；不论有多大天才的演员，也不能离开导演。演员喜爱导演，导演也喜爱演员，只有这样的热爱和精诚合作，才能产生出健康的孩子（角色）来。
    话题转到扮演领袖形象上。他说：“我们能生在列宁、斯大林的时代，成为一个为和平而斗争的演员，实在是很幸运的事。苏联电影中曾经成功地创造了列宁、斯大林的形象，我们也很希望中国的银幕上能早日出现中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东的形象。”
    谈到关于创造传记性戏剧、电影中的人物问题时，他说：“我们创造一个形象，不是照像，最重要的不是要求绝对的外形上的像。首先，我们要做到能刻划出人物的本质的东西来，具体地表现人物的思想活动。苏联演员格洛瓦尼和吉基都扮演斯大林，但在外形上，有些地方，他们不完全相同。巴甫洛夫的学生写信来说：银幕上的巴甫洛夫很好，但和本来的巴甫洛夫不完全一样。我们的回答是：最重要的不是外形，而是表现他的思想本质。因为艺术是给大多数人看的，不光是给巴甫洛夫的学生看的。所以我们扮演伟大人物时，不要单纯讲究外形上的像与不像，重要的是通过他们的生活、工作、言谈、举动，表达出他们伟大的思想的本质。”
