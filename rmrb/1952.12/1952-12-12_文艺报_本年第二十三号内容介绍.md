Introduction to Contents of "Wenyi Bao" This Year, No. 23

The World Peace Congress of the Peoples is about to open in Vienna. This issue of "Wenyi Bao" carries an editorial, "Warmly Support the World Peace Congress of the Peoples," expressing the ardent sentiments of the Chinese people and the Chinese literary and art circles in support of the Congress and wishing it a great success. The editorial calls on literary and art workers to take exposing the new war plots of imperialism and defending world peace as their primary combat task. Li Ling's article, "Brief Discussion on Guangdong Music," raises some opinions on the three questions: "Is Guangdong music folk music? What is its development?" "Is Guangdong music 'good or bad'? Should all radio broadcasts and home recordings be discarded?" "Will the use of Western musical instruments in Guangdong music cause good Guangdong music to deteriorate?" This article is helpful in correctly understanding and treating folk music.

The story of "The White Snake Legend" is a very precious creation of the Chinese people, widely circulated among the people, and has been adapted into scripts for stage performances, which are welcomed by the masses. However, there are various different opinions on how it should be adapted. This issue of "Wenyi Bao" publishes three articles by Yang Gang, Zhang Geng, and A Ying, respectively expressing their opinions on the theme, characterization, and plot handling of the story. The "Wenyi Bao" editorial department hopes that readers will participate in this discussion.

This issue of "Wenyi Bao" also publishes Zhang Junxiang's "Thoughts on Directing the Shanghai Opera 'Luohan Qian'," in which the author puts forward some opinions on how to preserve the traditional Chinese opera performance methods in the performance of modern life dramas based on his own experience in directing the Shanghai Opera "Luohan Qian."

The "Pravda" editorial "Create Works Worthy of the Soviet People" (translated by Cai Shiji) points out that the Soviet literary and art cause has achieved vigorous development under the care and guidance of the Party, but there are still shortcomings. The editorial clearly points out that the important task of literature and art is to "boldly express the contradictions and conflicts of life, and be good at using the weapon of criticism, taking it as an effective educational tool." Liurikoff's "It Wouldn't Be Like This in Life" (translated by Liao Yi) sharply criticizes the phenomenon of Soviet literary and art criticism being divorced from real life.

Regarding the discussion on the issue of new heroic characters, this issue of "Wenyi Bao" continues to publish "Disagree with Comrade Zhang Liyun's Arguments" (Cai Tian) and "Don't Close Your Eyes to Reality" (Huang Guliu). In addition, this issue also publishes "Some Experiences of Going to Factories for Internships" written by Li Hua, Ai Zhongxin, Yan Han, etc., introducing the situation of ninety-nine teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts going to factories for internships during the summer vacation.

Introduction to "Dazhong Dianying" Nos. 12 and 13

"Dazhong Dianying" Nos. 12 and 13 focus on introducing the seven representatives of the Soviet film art workers delegation who came to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities. From the introduction articles and interviews published in these two issues, we can understand the life of these outstanding Soviet film art workers, as well as their achievements and experiences in work and creation, and the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

"Dazhong Dianying" No. 13 also published more than a dozen articles written by workers, peasants, soldiers, educators, medical workers, and young students after watching Soviet films. These articles vividly illustrate the huge impact of Soviet films on the Chinese people and the importance of learning from Soviet films. For example, Wang Yinsheng, a worker at the casting factory of the Beijing Machine Factory, mentioned in his article that after watching the film "Donbas Miners," he felt that it was wrong for him to be satisfied with his "craftsmanship" in the past, and realized that to build a new China, it is necessary to master advanced production technology. Wu Chao Ren, vice president of Beijing University School of Medicine, said that after watching "Rural Doctor," he had a deeper understanding of the doctor's responsibility and a clearer understanding of the correct path for medical workers.

At the same time, "Dazhong Dianying" No. 12 introduced the films "We Insist on Peace," "Song of Youth," "Rural Doctor," and "Bright Summer," which participated in the Soviet film exhibition. Several articles analyzed and introduced the theme, artistic characteristics, musical creation, and production process of the film "We Insist on Peace."

In addition, these two issues also published Zhou Libo's "What I Know About Gerasimov" and Soviet writer Boris Volgin's "Friendly Unity of Soviet Film Workers and Audiences" and other articles.
