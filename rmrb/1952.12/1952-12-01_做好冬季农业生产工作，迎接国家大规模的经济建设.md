    Do a Good Job in Winter Agricultural Production to Welcome the Large-Scale National Economic Construction
    This winter's agricultural production faces new and important tasks. Our country is about to undertake large-scale economic construction, which requires more grain and economic crops. This glorious task has been placed before agricultural leadership organs and farmers across the country. We must start this winter to prepare sufficient conditions for next year's large-scale agricultural production. A very important condition is to carry out basic construction related to agricultural production. Only by carrying out necessary and possible basic construction on an organized basis can the requirements of next year's agricultural production plan be realized – a universal increase in yield per unit area.
    Our country's farmers have a habit of engaging in winter agricultural production. However, past winter production mostly involved sideline businesses, accumulating manure, and doing some sporadic farm work. These activities played a huge role in solving the farmers' livelihood difficulties. Now that the farmers' lives have been initially improved, their basic demand is to further develop agricultural production. The content of past winter production can no longer meet the needs of the farmers. Therefore, advanced agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in some advanced areas have already done a lot of basic agricultural construction work. This is entirely appropriate. Experience has shown that carrying out basic agricultural construction work is the best way to unleash production potential, universally increase yield per unit area, and consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations. This year, farmers in Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, increased grain production by 75,000 jin by building water conservancy facilities, turning 750 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The ten agricultural production cooperatives established in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province in 1951 carried out basic construction work such as repairing canals, digging wells, and leveling cultivated land in the spring of this year, which solved the problem of 24% of surplus labor. These agricultural production cooperatives have also grown stronger as a result. Wangjiazhuang Village, Licheng County, Shanxi Province, lacked water, and the masses had difficulty even drinking water. This year, under the leadership of the Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative, the farmers of the whole village built a canal. The masses had convenient access to drinking water and could irrigate more than 400 mu of land. Some villages in Anyang Prefecture, former Pingyuan Province, did not have mutual aid teams originally. This year, through jointly digging wells, many year-round mutual aid teams were organized. All these facts show that carrying out basic construction work can further enhance the farmers' enthusiasm for production and promote the farmers to organize and carry out agricultural production reform. This is exactly what is needed for the comprehensive development of agricultural production. According to the situation of the recovery and development of rural production in the past few years, except for a few disaster areas, some newly liberated areas that have just completed land reform, and areas with particularly difficult economic conditions that cannot carry out basic agricultural construction for the time being, the farmers in most areas have the strength and the demand to carry out basic agricultural construction. Only by guiding them to carry out basic construction work can the leading organs and cadres change their tendency to blindly engage in inappropriate sideline businesses or commerce. The content of basic agricultural construction is very rich: turning slopes into terraced fields, turning low-lying areas into flat land, improving the soil, building gullies and dams in mountainous areas, building reservoirs, building ponds and dams, building pigsties, building toilets, building livestock pens, etc. are all beneficial to long-term agricultural construction. Although a small part of these tasks requires a lot of manpower to complete, most of them are relatively simple, easy to implement, and easy to produce results. If a part of the manpower can be concentrated to do these tasks in a planned way, then a large amount of dry land can be turned into paddy fields, and poor land can be turned into fertile fields. In this way, significant increases in production can be achieved next year. Local leading organs should formulate specific plans according to the local conditions, adapt to local conditions, oppose both shrinking back and conservatism, and oppose blind and reckless advances, and make full use of all available conditions to organize and lead the masses to carry out these tasks.
    According to past experience, the key to carrying out winter production is to oppose spontaneous tendencies. Many farmers, and even some rural cadres, still have the old habit of "resting in winter." They believe that after working hard for a year, they should "take a rest" in winter. "The whole year's plan lies in spring," and winter is not a season for agricultural activities, so they can also "take a rest" temporarily. Especially in the context of universal harvests across the country for two consecutive years, and the improvement of the lives of the vast majority of farmers, this kind of thinking is even more likely to grow. The chairman of the Hengshan Township People's Government in Yingshan County, Hubei Province, attended a meeting in the district and accepted the task of leading the farmers in his township to organize winter plowing. Five or six days after returning to the village, he had not yet held a meeting. When asked why he did not mobilize the masses, he said: "Now everyone has enough to eat, so it's not easy for me to interfere." This situation is quite common at present. This shows that many cadres still regard winter production as a means to solve the current livelihood difficulties, and still lack the idea of long-term construction. They do not understand that the harvests of the past few years have only laid the foundation for future construction work; although the lives of the masses have improved, the standard of living is still very low. Organizing large-scale agricultural construction is the fundamental demand of the broad masses of farmers. This view that since the lives of the masses have improved, there is no need to lead them in winter production is actually a reflection of the farmers' conservative thinking of being content with the status quo. If this conservative thinking of being content with the status quo is not resolved, winter production work cannot be carried out well, and large-scale agricultural construction work cannot be carried out. Leading organs at all levels must first pay attention to solving these ideological problems of cadres and the masses, and help them establish the viewpoint of long-term construction, so as to truly carry out winter production work.
    In order to ensure that winter production is carried out in an organized and led manner and achieves due results, and in order to give a clear direction and steps for production and construction work in the coming year or even three or five years, it is necessary to launch a mass movement to formulate patriotic production increase plans. At present, some areas, in addition to formulating overall winter production plans for the entire area, are mobilizing farmers to formulate winter production plans and long-term construction plans. In the instructions on winter agricultural production issued by the former Chahar Province on October 30, specific plans that must be completed in terms of basic agricultural construction, pig raising and manure accumulation were put forward, and it was proposed that the entire province must be based on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to launch a mass plan-making movement. Villages, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers who can formulate plans are called upon to formulate production plans for this winter and next year, and to formulate long-term basic construction plans for three to five years as much as possible. At present, the plan-making movement in various provinces of North China is underway. This is a very timely measure. The process of formulating a plan is a process of fighting against conservative thinking and small-scale peasant economy thinking, and it is a process of tapping production potential. Therefore, in the process of formulating a plan, special attention must be paid to preventing the bias of formalism and coercion. Experience in recent years has proved that leading agricultural production must have a plan. There must be annual plans and seasonal plans. The annual plan can guarantee the realization of the annual production increase task, and the seasonal plan can guide the current practical actions of the masses. Especially when the state is about to start large-scale agricultural construction in a planned way next year, it is even more necessary for everyone from top to bottom to universally formulate this winter's production plan, and to formulate long-term construction plans as much as possible. Only in this way can the vast number of cadres and the masses have a clear goal of struggle, and can the state's plan be turned into the masses' plan, and the vast number of cadres and the masses can be organized in production to complete the task of national construction. Only in this way can it be easy to check the production situation at any time, solve the problems in production, and make the production achieve due results. This year, the old revolutionary base areas have launched agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to formulate long-term construction plans, which has enabled many farmers in mountainous areas to see the prospects for development and enhanced their confidence in increasing production. Many members of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Shanxi originally believed that there was no future for development in the mountainous area and wanted to move down the mountain. However, after formulating a three-year construction plan, not only did everyone's idea of moving disappear, but their enthusiasm for production became even higher. This experience is well worth learning from in various places.
    In order to more rationally arrange production and living steps, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, when formulating winter production plans, changed the past system of taking the period from spring to winter as an agricultural production year, and adopted the system of taking the period from the beginning of winter in the previous year to the autumn of the following year as an agricultural year, and listed this year's winter production plan as the first quarter plan for agricultural production in 1953 (from November this year to March next spring). This is a very appropriate method. It is in line with the law of annual agricultural production. In the past, taking spring as the first quarter of the agricultural production year often caused many of the work and measures of the agricultural production leading organs to fall behind the agricultural season, and the work fell into a passive state. The implementation of this new method clarifies the status and importance of winter production in the whole year's agricultural production. This can not only change the "winter leisure" thinking of cadres and farmers, but also enable cadres and farmers to further clarify that the purpose of winter production is to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest in agriculture in the coming year, which can change the method of "emphasizing sideline business and neglecting agriculture" or simply engaging in commerce by many farmers in winter production over the years, and give the winter production movement a correct direction. This new measure should be followed by various places.

### 做好冬季农业生产工作，迎接国家大规模的经济建设

    做好冬季农业生产工作，迎接国家大规模的经济建设
    今年冬季的农业生产面临着新的重大的任务。我们国家即将进行大规模的经济建设，大规模的经济建设需要更多的粮食和经济作物。这个光荣的任务已经提到农业领导机关和全国农民的面前了。我们必须从今年冬季开始，给明年大规模的农业生产准备足够的条件。这些条件中很重要的一个，就是进行有关农业生产的基本建设。只有在组织起来的基础上进行必要和可能的基本建设，才能实现明年农业生产计划的要求——普遍提高单位面积产量。
    我国农民是有进行冬季农业生产的习惯的。但过去的冬季生产，多是经营副业，积肥和作一些零星的农活。这些内容在解决农民的生活困难方面，曾经发挥了巨大的作用。现在农民的生活已有初步的改善，农民的基本要求是进一步发展农业生产，过去的冬季生产的内容，已不能满足农民的需要。因此，某些先进地区的先进的农业生产合作社和互助组，已经做了不少农业基本建设工作。这是完全适当的。经验证明：进行农业基本建设工作，是发挥生产潜在能力、普遍提高单位面积产量和巩固发展互助合作组织的最好方法。山西平顺县农民今年兴修水利，把七百五十亩旱地变成水地，共增产粮食七万五千斤。山西长治专区一九五一年创办的十个农业生产合作社，在今年春天进行修渠、打井、修整耕地等基本建设工作，使百分之二十四的剩余劳动力问题获得了解决。这些农业生产合作社也因此发展壮大了。山西黎城县王家庄缺水，群众吃水都很困难。今年全村农民在董桃气农业生产合作社的带头下，修了一道水渠。群众吃水方便了，并可浇地四百多亩。原平原省安阳专区有些村子原来没有互助组，今年通过共同打井，组织了好多常年互助组。这些事实都说明了：进行基本建设工作可以进一步提高农民的生产热情，推动农民组织起来进行农业生产改革。这正是全面发展农业生产所必需的。根据几年来农村生产恢复发展的情况，除了少数灾区，一部分刚完成土地改革的新区，和经济条件特殊困难一时不能进行农业基本建设的地区外，绝大部分地区的农民，是有力量和要求进行农业基本建设的。领导机关和干部也只有引导他们去进行基本建设工作，才能改变他们盲目经营不适当的副业或商业的趋势。农业基本建设的内容是很丰富的：把坡地修成梯田、把岗洼地修成平地、改良土壤、在山区修谷坊、筑水库、修塘坝、修猪圈、修厕所、盖牲口圈等，都是有利于长期农业建设的工作。这些工作，虽然有一小部分是要用较多的人力才能办到，但大多数是比较简单易行而且易生效果的。如能集中一部分人力，有计划地把这些工作做好，那么就可以把大量的旱地变为水地，把薄地变成肥田。这样，在明年就可以收到显著的增产效果。各地领导机关应根据本地的具体情况，因地制宜地作出具体计划，既反对退缩保守，又反对盲目冒进，尽量利用一切可以利用的条件，组织和领导群众，把这些工作开展起来。
    根据历年的经验，开展冬季生产的关键是反对自流思想。现在许多农民，甚至一部分农村干部，还有“歇冬”的旧习惯。他们认为忙了一年，应该在冬天“歇一歇”。“一年之计在于春”，冬季不是农事活动的季节，也可以暂时“歇一歇”。特别在全国一连两年普遍丰收，绝大部分农民的生活已经改善的情况下，这种思想更容易滋长起来。湖北省应山县横山乡人民政府主席在区里开过会，接受了领导本乡农民组织起来进行冬耕的任务，回到村中五、六天以后，还没有召开一次会，别人问他为什么不去动员群众，他说：“现在每家都有了吃的，叫我不好插手。”目前这种情况是相当普遍的。这说明许多干部还是把冬季生产看成是解决眼前生活困难的手段，还缺乏长期建设的思想。他们不了解过去几年的丰收，仅仅给今后的建设工作打下了基础；群众的生活虽然改善了，但生活水平还是很低的。而组织起来进行大规模的农业建设，正是广大农民群众的根本要求。这种以为群众的生活改善了，就用不着领导他们进行冬季生产的看法，实际上是农民的安于现状的保守思想的反映。这种安于现状的保守思想如不加以解决，冬季生产工作是不可能搞好的，大规模农业建设工作是不可能进行的。各级领导机关必须首先注意解决干部与群众的这些思想问题，使他们树立起长期建设的观点，以便把冬季生产工作真正开展起来。
    为了保证冬季生产有组织、有领导地开展起来并得到应有的成绩，为了使今后一年以至三年、五年的生产建设工作有明确的方向和步骤，开展一个群众性的订爱国增产计划的运动是很必要的。现在有些地区除已订出全地区总的冬季生产的计划而外，正在发动农民制订冬季生产计划和长期建设计划。前察哈尔省在十月三十日所发出的关于农业冬季生产的指示中，提出了在农业基本建设、养猪积肥等方面必须完成的具体计划，并提出全省必须以互助合作组织为基础，开展一个群众性的订计划运动。号召村、农业生产合作社、互助组以及能订计划的农户，都要订出今冬和明年一年的生产计划，并尽可能地订出三年至五年的长期基本建设计划。现在华北各省的订计划运动正在进行。这是极切合时宜的措施。订计划的过程，是和保守思想、小农经济思想作斗争的过程，是一个挖掘生产潜力的过程，因此，在订计划的过程中，必须特别注意防止形式主义和强迫命令的偏向。几年来的经验证明，领导农业生产必须有计划。必须有常年计划和季节性的计划。常年计划可以保证全年增产任务的实现，季节计划可以指导群众当前的实际行动。特别是在国家明年就要开始进行有计划的大规模农业建设的时候，从上到下都来普遍制订今年冬季的生产计划，并尽可能订出长期的建设计划，更是非常必要的。只有这样，才能使广大干部和群众有一个明确的奋斗目标，并使国家的计划变成群众的计划，把广大干部和群众在生产上组织起来，完成国家建设的任务。只有这样，才便于随时检查生产情况，解决生产中的问题，使生产获得应有的成绩。今年老根据地发动农业生产合作社和互助组制订长期建设计划，已使许多山区农民看到了发展前途，增强了增产信心。山西李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社许多社员原来认为山区没有发展前途，都想搬家下山。但订了三年建设计划以后，不仅大家的搬家念头打消了，而且生产热情更加高涨了。这一经验很值得各地吸取。
    为了更加合理地安排生产和生活步骤，山西省长治专区在订冬季生产计划的时候，改变了过去从春季到冬季作为一个农业生产年度的制度，采取了从头年冬季到第二年秋季作为一个农业年度的制度，把今年的冬季生产计划列为一九五三年农业生产第
    一季度的计划（从今年十一月到明春三月）。这是
    一个十分适当的办法。它是符合于一年一度的农业生产规律的。过去把春季作为农业生产年度的第一季度，常常使农业生产领导机关的许多工作和措施，落在农事季节的后面，使工作陷于被动。实行这种新的办法，就把冬季生产在全年农业生产中的地位和重要性明确起来了。这不仅可以改变干部和农民的“冬闲”思想，而且可以使干部和农民群众进一步明确冬季生产的目的在于为来年的农业丰产打下基础，这就可以改变历年来许多农民在冬季生产中“重副业轻农业”或单纯经营商业的办法，而使冬季生产运动有了正确的方向。这一个新的措施是各地应该仿行的。
