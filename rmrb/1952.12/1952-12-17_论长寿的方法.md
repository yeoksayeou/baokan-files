On Methods of Longevity
Academician of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences Ao. Lebeixinskaya

The issue of longevity and combating aging is an extremely complex one. It must be subjected to long-term and comprehensive research by experts in all aspects of biology and medicine.

Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the issue of longevity is, to a large extent, a social issue.

The Soviet Union has created all the conditions to eliminate many causes that contribute to premature aging. There is no exploitation of man by man here. The Stalin Constitution guarantees every Soviet citizen the right to rest. In the Soviet Union, care and concern for a person begins even before he is born. In the Soviet Union, the large-scale healthcare measures for the working people, the sports training of young people, and exercise—all of which have reached a truly national scale—consolidate, strengthen, and protect the human body.

The situation of the working people in capitalist countries is completely different, where they are ruled by the most ruthless exploitation. There, everything makes life short. Mass unemployment, poverty, and hunger are the inevitable companions of capitalism. Poor social and living conditions accelerate the onset of premature aging.

From the standpoint of a biologist discussing the issue of life and aging, we must first study life, aging, and death, and study all their laws. Only after studying these laws can we find methods to prolong life.

Currently, many questions in this area remain unresolved. But even if our current knowledge is insufficient and we cannot artificially create life in the laboratory, this does not mean that we will never be able to do it. Science in our country is advancing at such a tremendous pace that it is very likely that in the near future, we will be able to artificially obtain living matter—the proteins that constitute the cells of all living organisms. We will be able to observe how this living complex protein, called protoplasm, dies, or how it begins to develop and produce new cells under favorable conditions. Currently, Soviet scientists are successfully solving this problem. What exactly is life? Engels wrote: “Life is the mode of existence of proteins, the essential aspect of which consists in constant metabolic interchange with the natural environment outside them, and which ceases as soon as this interchange stops, causing the protein to decompose.”

But we know that metabolism also exists in the inorganic world. What is the difference here? Engels also gave a clear answer to this question. He wrote: “This metabolic interchange also occurs in inorganic bodies, and indeed is universally prevalent, because even when it is slow, chemical action is everywhere to be found. But the difference is this: in inorganic bodies, metabolism brings about their destruction, while in organic bodies it is a necessary condition of their existence.”

Death, and its precursor—aging, is inevitable. But the question is: is it impossible to delay aging and death? And to what extent can life be prolonged? Are we dying prematurely? According to some famous physiologists, the possible survival limit for humans is no less than two hundred years. And we actually have a large number of instances of longevity. In Ukraine, there are tens of thousands of people over the age of one hundred. We know of some examples where 155-year-olds not only continue to live but even continue to work. Many of these elderly people did not die from physiological aging but from various accidental diseases that cut short their lives. This shows that even 155 years is not the limit of life.

However, why do people not only not live to 155 years but, in most cases, die at a much earlier age? In our opinion, the main cause of aging is the aging process of proteins.

The protein molecules of living matter carry various electrical charges. They collide, combine, and simultaneously lose half of their charges, release water, and gradually condense, resulting in a decline in metabolism. The aging of proteins is due to this. On the one hand, condensation can occur automatically, and on the other hand, it can be accelerated or delayed by certain external influences.

Many scientists have made mistakes in attempting to understand aging and death: they do not consider certain major basic processes occurring in the organism, especially the essence of protein aging and the influence of the surrounding environment on it.

The cause of protein aging cannot be seen in any single factor. The main error of general researchers is that they study aging and death from a static, metaphysical point of view, rather than in the process of development, in all interrelationships. They do not focus their attention on the complex of phenomena and causes but on a single thing.

When aging, as we have already mentioned, the process of protein particle condensation begins in the cells due to various complex reasons. The condensation of protoplasm occurs, which affects the entire organism and all its tissues and organs, primarily affecting metabolism. This condensation phenomenon is accelerated by many reasons, which promote the condensation of protein particles in the cells and the formation of dense connective tissue, in other words, the hardening of all organs, especially blood vessels, which further disrupts metabolism and accelerates the early onset of aging.

It is possible to combat premature aging. Preventing and treating aging is within the power of man. In the first stage of solving this complex problem, we must first study all the causes that lead to protein condensation and then study all the methods that can hinder the condensation of protein particles and the decline of metabolism. Everything that can increase the degree of dispersion of proteins, that is, their dispersibility, and can increase the electrical charge of protein particles that have a role in promoting metabolism will be used as such methods.

While studying the influence of various chemical substances on animal cell membranes, I encountered a very interesting phenomenon: under the influence of a 1% concentration of soda solution, the red blood cell membranes of growing frogs become as fragile as those of young frogs—they become younger. What exactly is happening in the cells in this case?

The change in the thickness of the membrane is undoubtedly determined by the change in the degree of dispersion of proteins. From these experiments, I concluded that under the influence of a 1% soda solution, the degree of dispersion of proteins increases, that is, metabolism increases. Later, while studying the age-related changes in frog red blood cell membranes, I discovered a very interesting phenomenon: in the earliest stages of tadpole or egg development, there is no red blood cell membrane at all. In later stages, but still in the juvenile stage, the red blood cell membranes are loose, and when they grow up, they become very fine and tight. This led me to the idea that the thickness of the membrane is closely related to age, and therefore, metabolism must decrease with age.

Metabolism is the basic factor of the vitality of any organism. From this, it can be seen that the thickness of the membrane must be one of the main factors that play a decisive role in the vitality of the organism.

An important feature is that protein molecules can combine with each other, resulting in water渗出, reduced dispersion, and a smaller membrane volume, thus reducing metabolism and vitality.

How can this process be delayed to increase the dispersion of proteins, so as to simultaneously promote metabolism and strengthen the vitality of cells and the organism? We found that if a protein molecule that has become larger and combined with another molecule and exuded water, that is, a condensed molecule, is added with baking soda, then two small molecules will be formed again from one large molecule. From this, it can be seen that the degree of dispersion increases, and at the same time, metabolism must also increase, and vitality is also enhanced.

Starting from these theoretical premises, we decided to conduct a series of experiments to study the influence of soda on the degree of dispersion of protein molecules and on the morphological changes in cells. We studied the effect of soda on red blood cell membranes. We took fifteen drops of blood from a growing frog, added three drops of 1% soda solution, and then took one drop of this mixed liquid every ten minutes and observed it under the dark background of a microscope. The longer the soda acts, the more and more dispersed the blood cell membranes become, until they finally break into extremely fine particles.

But these experiments are not enough to give us a clear idea of what effect it would have on the red blood cell membranes if soda were injected into a living body. To clarify this issue, we injected 1% soda solution into the frog's body and then examined its blood. The effect obtained was the same.

In order to further explore the question of how the entire organism would react to soda, we placed a group of tadpoles in a 1% soda solution, another group in a hydrochloric acid solution, and another group in clear water. The tadpoles in the hydrochloric acid solution died quickly, the group in clear water developed normally, and the group in the 1% soda solution were very active, and their development was much faster.

We used eggs for the same kind of experiment, by injecting one drop of 1% soda solution into each egg every day. The chicks obtained from the eggs that had undergone this experiment hatched one day earlier and were more vital.

We also studied the effect of 1% soda solution on beet seeds. Some seeds were soaked in 1% soda solution for one day before sowing, while others were soaked in clear water for one day as a control experiment. As a result, the yield of tubers from the seeds soaked in soda increased by 40%. These laboratory experiments we did have been verified on small outdoor plots by some places, especially the Valdai Normal School (Вапдайское педагогическое Учипище), and the results everywhere confirmed our experiments.

The above-mentioned experiments prompted us to further test our observations on the human body. I used myself as the first experimental subject. The method of the experiment was to take a soda water bath according to a special formula. What changes did my body show under the influence of the soda bath? The whole body became thinner, and excess fat disappeared. Undoubtedly, this is closely related to the increase in metabolism. The scars and healed marks left over from pulmonary tuberculosis in my early years disappeared.

These experiments have been verified on many people. In most cases, they produced results of weight loss and feeling good about their health.

However, the issue of applying soda baths certainly requires further clinical testing. Such experiments must be carried out under the guidance of a physician and must be accompanied by blood tests, paying attention not to allow the blood components to fall below normal, because the effect of soda may cause the disintegration of red blood cell membranes and reduce the number of red blood cells.

From this, it can be seen, as the experiment proves, that metabolism is the main key to prolonging life. This means that substances that can increase the dispersion of proteins (soda) can play a role in the struggle against aging, hardening, and other diseases of the organism.

It is not appropriate to remain silent about the existing materials on this issue. Other researchers must also be involved in this work of great importance, expanding this work to the vast field of various phenomena and materials. The research prospects for the issue of longevity are broad. I am convinced that our scientists, handling the problem with the correct methodology, will definitely decisively promote the solution of this problem.

    论长寿的方法
    苏联医学科学院院士  奥·勒柏辛斯卡娅
    长寿，与衰老作斗争的问题是一个极端复杂的问题。必须由生物学和医学的各方面的专家来进行长期和全面的研究。
    而且不应当忘记，长寿问题，在很大的程度上是一个社会性的问题。
    苏联已经创造了一切条件，使许多促成早衰的原因得以消除。我们这里没有人对人的剥削。斯大林宪法保证每一个苏联公民有休息的权利。在苏联，对于一个人的关心照顾，在他还没有诞生的时候就已经开始了。在苏联，达到了真正全民规模的劳动人民的大规模保健措施、青年的体育训练、运动——这一切都巩固、健全、保护着人的身体。
    资本主义国家中的劳动人民，就完全是另一种情况，那里为最无情的剥削所统治着。在那里一切都使得生命短促。大批的失业，贫穷和饥饿——乃是资本主义底必然的伴随者。不良的社会条件和生活条件，加速早衰的来临。
    从生物学家的立场来谈生命和衰老的问题，我们首先必须研究生命、衰老和死亡，研究它们所有的规律。只有在研究了这些规律之后，我们才能够找到延长生命的方法。
    目前，有关这一方面的问题中，很多还是未曾得到解决的。可是即使眼前我们的知识还不足，因而还不能在实验室中人工地创造出生命来，但这并不表示说，我们将永远不能做到它。科学在我们国家里是以如此巨大的步伐在向前迈进着，因此很可能在不久的将来，我们就能够人工地得到活质——一切生活体的细胞所由构成的蛋白质。我们将能观察到，这种被称为原形质的有生命的复杂蛋白质，是如何地死亡，或者在良好的条件下如何地开始发展而产生新细胞。目前苏联的科学家们，正在成功地解决这个问题。生命究竟是什么呢？恩格斯写道：“生命——是蛋白质的存在形态，它的根本契机就是它和它的周围的外部自然界不断的新陈代谢，这种新陈代谢一停止，生命就跟着停止，蛋白质也就分解了。”
    可是我们知道新陈代谢也存在于无机的自然界。这里差别在什么地方呢？恩格斯对这个问题也同样提出了明确的答复。他写道：“这种新陈代谢在无机体中也是可以发生的，而且事实上也在普遍发生着，因为即使进行很慢，化学作用却是到处都发生的。然而差别是在于：在无机体的情形下新陈代谢破坏了它们，而在有机体的情形下新陈代谢却是它们必要的存在条件。”
    死亡以及它的先驱者——衰老，是不可避免的。但是试问：是否不可能将衰老和死亡延缓呢？而生命究竟可能延长到什么样的限度呢？我们是否在过早地死亡呢？照某些著名的生理学家的意见，人的可能的生存极限不在二百岁以下。而且我们事实上也有着一大批长寿的实例。在乌克兰就有几万人有着百岁以上的高龄。我们知道一些例子，其中一百五十五岁的老人不但继续生活，甚至继续工作。这些老人中很多都不是死于生理上的衰老，而是死于各种阻断了他们的生命的偶然的疾病。这说明了，即使一百五十五岁也还不是生命的极限。
    然而为什么人们不仅活不到一百五十五岁，而且在大多数的情形下在比这早得多的年岁就死去呢？照我们的意见，衰老的主要原因是蛋白质的衰老过程。
    活质的蛋白质分子，负着各种不同的电荷，它们互相碰撞、结合，同时失去自己的电荷的一半，放出水而逐渐凝聚，结果引起新陈代谢的低落。蛋白质的衰老，其原因就在于此。一方面，凝聚是能够自动发生的，而另一方面，它也能够因某些外界的影响而被加速或者被阻延。
    很多科学家在企图理解衰老和死亡的时候犯了错误：他们不考虑发生于有机体中的某些主要的基本过程，尤其是蛋白质的衰老及周围环境对它的影响这一本质。
    在单独的某一个因素中是不能看到蛋白质衰老的原因的。一般研究者的主要错误是，他们是以静止的、形而上学的观点去研究衰老和死亡，而不是在发展的过程中，在一切的相互关联中去研究它们的，他们不把自己的注意力集中在现象和原因的复合体上，而是集中在某一个单独的东西上。
    当衰老的时候，如像我们前面已经讲过的，在细胞中由于各种复杂的原因而开始了蛋白质粒子凝聚的过程，发生了活质原形质的凝聚，结果影响到整个有机体，以及它的一切组织和器官，首先是影响到新陈代谢。这种凝聚现象因为许许多多的原因而加速，这些原因促进细胞中蛋白质粒子的凝聚以及紧密的结缔组织的形成，换言之也就是所有器官特别是血管的硬化，这就更加破坏了新陈代谢而加速衰老的早发。
    与早衰作斗争是可能的。阻止和治疗衰老，这是人的力量可以办到的。在解决这一复杂问题的第一阶段中，必须首先研究所有引起蛋白质凝聚的原因，然后研究一切能阻碍蛋白质粒子的凝聚和新陈代谢的低落的方法。被用来作为这样的方法的，将是一切能增加蛋白质部分的分散度，亦即它们的分散性，能提高有增进新陈代谢的作用的蛋白质粒子的电荷的物质。
    在研究各种化学物质对动物细胞膜的影响的时候，我碰到一种非常有趣的现象：在百分之一浓度的苏打溶液影响下，成长的青蛙的红血球膜，会变得像幼蛙的红血球膜那样的脆薄——它们变年青了。究竟在这种情况下细胞中发生了什么样的过程呢？
    膜的厚度的变化，无疑地，是决定于蛋白质的分散度的变化的。从这些实验中我得出了一个结论，就是在百分之一苏打溶液的影响下，蛋白质的分散度增高了，也就是说，新陈代谢增高了。其后，在研究蛙的红血球膜的年龄变化时，我又发现了一个非常有趣的现象：在蝌蚪或者鸡蛋发育的最早阶段中，是完全没有红血球膜的，在较迟的阶段，但是仍然处于幼年期的时候，红血球膜是宽松的，而当成长以后，它们就非常细致而紧密了。这使我得到膜的厚度与年龄有密切的关系，因而，新陈代谢必随年龄而降低的想法。
    新陈代谢是任何有机体的活力的基本因素。由这一点可以看出，膜的厚度必定是对有机体的活力起着决定影响的主要作用之一。
    重要的特点是：蛋白质分子能够互相结合，其结果使水分渗出，分散度降低，膜的容积变小，因而使新陈代谢降低，活力降低。
    怎样才能阻延这种过程而增大蛋白质的分散度，使得同时增进新陈代谢和加强细胞和有机体的活力呢？我们发现，假如把一个变得较大了的、并且与另一个分子结合而渗出了水的蛋白质分子，亦即凝聚了的分子，加以小苏打，那么由一个大的分子重新又会形成两个小的。由此可见，分散度增高了，而同时新陈代谢也一定增进，活力也增强了。
    从这一些理论上的前提出发，我们决定作一系列的实验来研究苏打对于蛋白质分子的分散度，对于细胞中的形态学变化所起的影响。我们研究了苏打对红血球膜的影响。我们取一只成长的青蛙的血液十五滴，加入百分之一的小苏打溶液三滴，然后每隔十分钟取这种混合液体一滴，放在显微镜的黑暗背景下观察。苏打作用的时间愈久，血球膜就不断地愈来愈分散，直到最后破裂成极细的微粒。
    但是这些实验还不足以使我们有一个明确的概念，就是如果把苏打注入生活体时，它会在红血球膜上产生什么样的影响。为了弄明白这一个问题，我们把百分之一的小苏打溶液注入蛙体内，然后检查它的血液，结果所得到的效果是同样的。
    为着进一步探明整个有机体会对苏打产生怎样的反应这样一个问题，我们把一组蝌蚪放在百分之一的苏打溶液中，另一组放在盐酸溶液中，再把一组放在清水中。在盐酸溶液中的蝌蚪很快就死掉了，在清水中的一组则正常发育，而在百分之一的苏打溶液中的一组却非常活泼，并且它们的发育要快得多。
    我们曾经用鸡蛋作过同样性质的实验，方法是每天给每一个鸡蛋注射百分之一浓度的苏打溶液一滴。由做过这种实验的鸡蛋所得到的小鸡，其孵出的时间早了一昼夜，并且比较更富有生命力。
    我们还研究了百分之一苏打溶液对甜菜种子所起的影响。把一些种子在播种前先在百分之一的苏打溶液中浸一昼夜，而另外把一些作对照实验用的种子，在清水中浸一昼夜。结果，经苏打浸过的种子，其块根的收获量增加了百分之四十。我们所做的这些实验室的试验，曾经由一些地方，尤其是瓦尔戴师范学校（ВапдайскоепедагогическоеУчипище），在小块的户外地校验过，各处的结果都证实了我们的试验。
    以上种种的实验，促使我们进一步用人的身体做对象来检验我们的观察。我用自己作第一次实验。试验的方式是：按照特别的配方进行苏打水沐浴。结果我的身体在苏打浴的影响下显示了什么样的变化呢？整个身体减瘦，多余的脂肪消失，无疑的，这与新陈代谢的增进有密切关系的；早年患肺结核遗留下的疤痕和愈合痕消失了。
    这些实验已经在许多人的身上进行检验过。在大多数的情形下，都产生减瘦及对自己健康状态感觉良好的结果。
    但是，关于应用苏打浴的问题当然还需要进一步的临床检验。这样的实验一定要在医师的指导下才可以进行，并且要佐之以血液检验，注意不使血液成份低于正常，因为在苏打的影响下可能引起红血球膜的散裂，红血球数降低。
    由此可见，如实验所证明的，新陈代谢是延长生命的主要关键，这就是说，能增加蛋白质分散度的物质（苏打），能够在与有机体的衰老、硬化以及其他疾病的斗争中起作用。
    对有关这个问题的已有材料缄口不言是不应当的。必须使别的研究者也加入这个具有极大重要性的工作，将这个工作扩大到各种现象和物质的广大领域中去。长寿问题的研究前途是远大的。我确信我们的科学家，以正确的方法论来处理问题，一定能够决定性地促进这一问题的解决。
