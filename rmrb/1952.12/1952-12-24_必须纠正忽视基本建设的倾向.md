Short Commentary:

    Currently, some leading cadres in factories and mines are adopting a perfunctory attitude towards the basic construction tasks they must complete next year, which is extremely dangerous. If these factories and mines do not quickly correct this erroneous attitude and earnestly place basic construction in a position of primary importance, they are bound to suffer.

    Whether mines and factories with significant basic construction tasks for next year have placed basic construction in a position of primary importance should first be judged by whether they have established a strong basic construction organization and whether they have intensified preparations for next year's basic construction. Without a strong basic construction organization, all preparatory work will be impossible to begin. If this year's preparatory work is delayed, next year's projects will be passive everywhere.

    The situations of the Fengfeng and Huainan Mining Bureaus, as published in this newspaper today, show that they have not earnestly implemented the principle of "placing basic construction in a position of primary importance." As of early December, these two mining bureaus had not yet seriously strengthened their basic construction organizations, and many important preparatory tasks had not yet begun. Many of the cadres transferred to the basic construction departments are uneasy about their work, and they even draw cadres and workers from the basic construction departments into production. This fully demonstrates that they are adopting a perfunctory attitude towards basic construction tasks. The basic construction tasks of the Huainan and Fengfeng Mining Bureaus were not well completed this year. If they do not quickly strengthen the basic construction organization and actively make preparations, not only will next year's construction tasks not be guaranteed, but it will inevitably affect the basic construction work in the coming years.

    The situations of the Fengfeng and Huainan Mining Bureaus are clearly not isolated phenomena. The situations in some mining bureaus in North China and East China are roughly the same. The existence of this situation is mainly because the thinking of the leading cadres of various mining bureaus is vague. In addition, the Coal Mine Management Bureau, which originally directly led the mines in North China and East China, did not take effective measures to implement the principle of "placing basic construction in a position of primary importance." The party organizations of the various mining bureaus have not achieved strong political and ideological leadership at this critical turning point, and even accommodated certain erroneous ideas. We hope that the Fengfeng and Huainan Mining Bureaus and all units with similar situations will, starting with the leading cadres, quickly concentrate their efforts, mobilize their forces, establish basic construction organizations within a limited time, intensify various preparatory work, correct the perfunctory attitude towards basic construction, and quickly reverse the tendency to neglect basic construction.

### 必须纠正忽视基本建设的倾向

    必须纠正忽视基本建设的倾向
    目前有一些厂矿的领导干部，对于他们在明年必须完成的基本建设任务，采取着马虎敷衍的态度，这是非常危险的。这些厂矿如果不赶快纠正这种错误的态度，认真地把基本建设放到首要地位上来，就一定要吃亏。
    明年基本建设任务重大的矿厂，是否已把基本建设放在首要地位，首先要看是否建立了强大的基本建设机构，是否加紧进行了明年基本建设的准备工作。没有强大的基本建设机构，一切准备工作都将无法着手进行。今年的准备工作迟了一步，明年的工程就要处处被动。
    今天本报发表的峰峰和淮南两矿务局的情况，说明他们没有认真贯彻“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针。直到十二月初，这两个矿务局还没有认真地把基本建设机构加强起来，许多重要的准备工作也都还没有着手进行。他们调往基本建设部门的干部有不少是工作不安心的，甚至还把基本建设部门的干部和工人往生产方面抽调。这完全表现了他们对于基本建设任务采取着一种马虎敷衍的态度。淮南和峰峰两矿务局今年的基本建设任务就没有很好完成，如果再不赶快加强基本建设机构，积极进行准备，不但明年的建设任务无法得到保证，而且势必要影响到今后若干年的基本建设工作。
    峰峰和淮南两矿务局的情况显然不是个别的现象。华北、华东有些矿务局的情况也大体相同。这种情况的存在，主要是因为各矿务局领导干部思想模糊。此外，也还因为原来直接领导华北、华东各矿的煤矿管理总局没有采取有效的措施，贯彻“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针。各矿务局的党的组织，也没有在这个转变的关头实现有力的政治、思想领导，甚至还迁就了某些错误的思想。我们希望峰峰和淮南两矿务局以及所有具有类似情况的单位，由领导干部做起，赶快集中精力，动员力量，限期建立基本建设的机构，加紧进行各项准备工作，纠正对基本建设的马虎敷衍态度，迅速扭转忽视基本建设的倾向。
