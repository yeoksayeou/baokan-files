    Southwest Electric Power Administration Holds Meeting
    Decides to Concentrate Efforts on Capital Construction
    The Southwest Industrial Department's Electric Power Administration held a capital construction meeting from November 20th to 26th, deciding to prioritize capital construction in the coming year.

    The meeting summarized the experiences of capital construction in the Southwest electric power sector, pointing out that while the tasks of capital construction have increased year by year and some achievements have been made, there are still many serious shortcomings, and the engineering design and construction management are extremely chaotic. In general, leading cadres emphasize production but not capital construction, leaving capital construction work in a state of laissez-faire. There is no specialized organization, the division of labor between construction, design, planning, and materials departments is unclear, responsibilities are not defined, and capital construction funds are mixed with production funds and used arbitrarily. Technical personnel do not conduct in-depth on-site investigations and research, emphasize the special circumstances of the Southwest, and do not implement the Interim Measures for Capital Construction Work issued by the Central Financial and Economic Commission. Most of the engineering plans and designs are formulated out of thin air in the office and do not meet actual needs. For example, the Chongqing line project has increased investment several times due to the lack of an overall plan, affecting the progress of the project. Currently, the project is nearing completion, but the project procedures have not yet been submitted to the central government. Some projects have caused serious waste and backlog due to inadequate planning. For example, when installing a certain machine, no inspection was conducted beforehand, resulting in many hidden accidents being discovered after one year of operation, resulting in significant losses.

    The meeting focused on criticizing the erroneous thinking of general cadres who do not attach importance to capital construction, are unwilling to transfer outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and workers from production departments to capital construction departments, and simply wait for and rely on the higher authorities to allocate cadres. It was decided that cadres must be drawn from production departments to establish independent specialized agencies for planning, design, and construction to do a good job in capital construction. The meeting also emphasized that preliminary preparatory work such as design data and survey plans must be completed before the end of this year.

    西南电业管理局召开会议
    决定集中力量做好基本建设工作
    西南工业部电业管理局于十一月二十日至二十六日召开了电业系统的基本建设会议，决定明年将基本建设工作提到首要地位。
    会议总结了西南电业基本建设的经验，指出：西南电业部门的基本建设工作任务逐年增加，在工作中虽取得一定成绩，但也还存在许多严重缺点，工程设计和施工管理极为混乱。一般领导干部重视生产，不重视基本建设，使基本建设工作陷于自流状态。没有建立专门机构，施工、设计、计划、材料等部门分工不明确，责任不明，基本建设资金与生产资金混在一起，任意动用。技术人员不深入现场调查研究，强调西南特殊情况，不执行中央财政经济委员会颁发的基本建设工作暂行办法。工程计划、设计大部分是坐在办公室里凭空拟定，不适合实际需要。如重庆线路工程，由于没有全盘计划，几次增加投资，影响工程进展，目前工程快完工了，工程手续还未呈报中央。有的工程由于计划不周，造成严重浪费积压现象。又如安装某项机器，事前未进行检查，以致运转一年，就发现很多隐形事故，损失很大。
    会议着重批判了一般干部不重视基本建设，不愿把生产部门的优秀干部、技术人员和工人调到基本建设部门，单纯等待和依赖上级分配干部等错误思想；并作出必须从生产部门中抽调干部，建立独立的计划、设计、施工等专门机构，搞好基本建设工作的决定。会议并强调指出今年年底以前必须作好设计资料、勘察计划等初步准备工作。
