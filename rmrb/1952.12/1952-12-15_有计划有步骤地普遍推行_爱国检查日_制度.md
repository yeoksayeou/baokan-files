    Systematically and Methodically Promote the "Patriotic Inspection Day" System

    The "Patriotic Inspection Day" (originally named "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day") system created by residents of the Ninth Police Station in the Second District of Beijing and the masses of Weishe Village in Pingle County, Shanxi Province, has now been widely promoted in many regions across the country. According to incomplete statistics, thousands of villages and other units across the country have implemented this system. Shanxi Province and Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province have universally implemented it (1,327 villages in Handan Prefecture have established the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system). Heilongjiang Province and Zhejiang Province have both focused on promoting it throughout their respective provinces. In Suiyuan Province, former Pingyuan Province, former Chahar Province, and the former North Sichuan Administrative Region, a considerable number of villages have established this system. Some rural areas in Jilin, Songjiang, Liaoxi, Shandong, Henan, Jiangxi provinces, some streets in cities like Jinzhou and Beijing, and some institutions and schools (such as Wanxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Sichuan Province, and Guo Wangdu Village Central Elementary School in the Fourth District of Anyang County, Henan Province) have also established "Patriotic Inspection Day." Experiences in various places have proven that holding "Patriotic Inspection Day" regularly is a good leadership method to improve and consolidate the patriotic convention movement, strengthen the democratic life of the masses, thereby continuously improving the political consciousness of the masses and promoting the advancement of various tasks. Therefore, we suggest that all regions systematically and methodically promote this system universally.

    Generally, the "Patriotic Inspection Day" in various places is held every half month, led by the local Communist Party branch, with the Party's propagandist responsible for mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate. The main activities are: (1) Conducting current affairs and political propaganda and production propaganda to the masses based on the current situation and central tasks. (2) Summarizing the work of the previous half month, discussing and deploying the work of the next half month by inspecting and revising the patriotic convention, and carrying out mass commendations and criticisms, launching competitions, etc. In addition, some "Patriotic Inspection Day" gatherings in some places are also accompanied by some short and concise cultural and entertainment activities. According to local experiences, implementing the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system can generally play the following roles: (1) Making the inspection and revision of the patriotic convention a mass, regular, and periodic system. In each "Patriotic Inspection Day" activity, the patriotic convention is supplemented and revised by the masses themselves according to the current tasks and work progress, and its implementation is guaranteed by means of competitions. This effectively overcomes the tendency of formalism in the patriotic convention movement and makes the patriotic convention a weapon to continuously promote the advancement of work. (2) Making current affairs and political propaganda and production propaganda regular. The people can regularly and periodically receive patriotic education in the activities of "Patriotic Inspection Day." Party propagandists and mass propaganda organizations (such as blackboards, loudspeakers, reading groups, and amateur theater troupes) can also regularly carry out activities around "Patriotic Inspection Day," which enriches the content of the Party's propaganda work to the people and consolidates the organization of the Party's propaganda network to the people. (3) Strengthening the democratic life of the people. "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities can attract almost all residents to discuss and inspect public affairs, conduct criticism and self-criticism; and can improve the leadership methods of cadres, overcome the unplanned busyness and paternalistic, coercive working styles of some cadres; and can also concentrate discussions on many tasks, promptly convey and deploy them, greatly saving cadres and the masses meeting time. (4) Cultivating the habit of collective life among the people and promoting mass cultural and entertainment activities. After the establishment of "Patriotic Inspection Day" in many places, the atmosphere of unity and friendship among the masses has significantly increased. Every time on "Patriotic Inspection Day," men, women, old and young all come out together, singing and dancing, showing a vigorous and energetic atmosphere, thus inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses.

    It is precisely because of these reasons that the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities in various places are generally welcomed by the broad masses. In many places, the number of people participating in "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities reaches more than 80% of all residents, and even many women, elderly people, and children who never participate in meetings participate. It is also because of these reasons that many villages or other units that were originally backward and lifeless have been transformed into advanced villages or units with a boiling political life after the implementation of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system and the improvement of the political consciousness of the people.

    We believe that the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system can and should be universally promoted throughout the country, and should be promoted among rural and urban residents. Since the widespread and in-depth development of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education last year, more than half of the people across the country have signed patriotic conventions. Patriotic conventions have played a significant role in promoting and guaranteeing the national campaign for increased production and thrift, the donation of weapons, doing a good job in preferential treatment for military families, and carrying out political and cultural studies. Now, our motherland is about to begin large-scale, planned construction work; at the same time, because the American aggressors insist on continuing and attempting to expand the Korean War, we must continue to strengthen the work of Resist America, Aid Korea while carrying out large-scale construction work. In order to continue to strengthen the work of supporting the Volunteer Army, and to better organize the people to devote themselves to the construction of the motherland, all parts of the country should mobilize the people to universally inspect and revise patriotic conventions, and constantly update their patriotic action plans according to current tasks. And promoting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system is the best way to organize the people to regularly and periodically inspect and revise patriotic conventions. It is understood that the problem of formalism in the patriotic convention movement in many regions has not been well overcome, and the leadership over the patriotic convention has recently been relaxed; other regions are suffering from the difficulty of keeping current affairs and political propaganda work regular, and the propaganda work is "cold for a while, hot for a while." Promoting "Patriotic Inspection Day" will be an effective way to solve these problems.

    When promoting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, the Party's leading organs in various places should make plans, and gradually promote it step by step and with emphasis. First of all, cadres should be educated to make them understand the meaning and role of "Patriotic Inspection Day" and prepare for it. Then organize and strengthen the propaganda force (preferably by adopting the method of "contract propaganda"), carry out propaganda among all residents, and mobilize everyone to participate in this activity. Before each "Patriotic Inspection Day" is held, the Party branch committee should determine the activity center, and mobilize the masses through propagandists to check their implementation of the patriotic convention (including Resist America, Aid Korea work, various work tasks, production tasks and learning tasks stipulated by the state) around this center, as preparation for participating in the meeting. Carrying out activities with preparation and focus in this way can enable "Patriotic Inspection Day" to concentrate on solving major problems in a relatively short period of time, avoiding the problem of meetings being too long and failing to solve major problems. Each "Patriotic Inspection Day" activity should have appropriate current affairs and political propaganda and production propaganda, but this propaganda must be concise and avoid lengthy speeches, taking up the time of the masses to speak. In addition, the programs of cultural and entertainment activities must be short and concise, and the time must be strictly controlled to prevent excessive cultural and entertainment activities from hindering inspection, discussion work and current affairs and political propaganda. As for the scope of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" gathering, it is more appropriate to take villages as units in rural areas (townships can be taken as units where the residence is very concentrated) and police station jurisdictions as units among urban residents; it is more appropriate to hold it once every half a month.

### 有计划有步骤地普遍推行“爱国检查日”制度

    有计划有步骤地普遍推行“爱国检查日”制度
    北京市第二区第九派出所居民和山西省平定县维社村群众所创造的“爱国检查日”（原名为“抗美援朝爱国日”）制度，现已在全国许多地区广泛推行。据不完全的材料统计，全国各地已有数千个村庄及其他单位推行这种制度，其中山西全省和河北省的邯郸专区等地已普遍推行（邯郸专区建立了“爱国检查日”制度的有一千三百二十七个村）。黑龙江省和浙江省都在全省范围内作了重点推广。绥远省、前平原省、前察哈尔省和前川北行政区境内，都有相当数量的村庄建立了这种制度。吉林、松江、辽西、山东、河南、江西等省的某些农村，锦州、北京等市的某些街道，和各地的某些机关、学校（如四川省万县邮电局、河南省安阳县四区郭王度村中心小学），也建立了“爱国检查日”。各地的经验证明，定期地举行“爱国检查日”，是提高和巩固爱国公约运动，加强群众的民主生活，从而不断地提高群众的政治觉悟，推动各种工作前进的一种很好的领导方法。因此，我们建议各地有计划有步骤地普遍推行这种制度。
    各地的“爱国检查日”，一般是每半月举行一次，由当地共产党支部领导，党的宣传员负责发动和组织群众参加。主要活动是：（一）根据当前形势和中心工作，向群众进行时事政治宣传和生产宣传。（二）通过检查、修订爱国公约来总结上半个月的工作，讨论、布置下半个月的工作，并开展群众性的表扬和批评，发动竞赛等。此外，有些地方的“爱国检查日”集会还配合一些短小精悍的文化娱乐活动。据各地经验，实行“爱国检查日”制度一般能起下列几方面的作用：（一）使爱国公约的检查和修订成为一种群众性的经常的定期的制度。在每次
    “爱国检查日”活动中，都根据当前任务和工作进展程度由群众自己补充修正爱国公约，并以竞赛的方式保证执行。这样就有效地克服了爱国公约运动中的形式主义偏向，使爱国公约成为不断地推动工作前进的武器。（二）使时事政治宣传和生产宣传经常化。人民群众能够在“爱国检查日”的活动中有规律地定期地受到爱国主义的教育。党的宣传员和群众性的宣传组织（如黑板报、广播筒、读报组、业余剧团）也能够定期地围绕“爱国检查日”展开活动，这就充实了党对人民群众的宣传工作的内容，也巩固了党对人民群众的宣传网的组织。（三）加强人民群众的民主生活。“爱国检查日”活动能够吸引几乎是全体的居民来讨论和检查公共事务，展开批评与自我批评；并能改进干部的领导方法，克服某些干部无计划地忙乱和包办代替、强迫命令的工作作风；还可以使许多工作集中讨论，及时传达布置，大大节省干部和群众的开会时间。（四）培养人民群众集体生活的习惯，并推进群众性的文化娱乐活动。许多地方在建立“爱国检查日”之后，群众间团结友爱的气氛显著增加。每当“爱国检查日”这一天，男女老少一齐出动，载歌载舞，显出一片蓬蓬勃勃的朝气，因而鼓舞了群众的爱国热情和生产积极性。
    就是因为这些缘故，各地的“爱国检查日”活动一般都得到广大群众的欢迎，许多地方参加“爱国检查日”活动的人数达到全体居民的百分之八十以上，连许多从来不参加开会的妇女、老年人和小孩子都参加了。也就是因为这些缘故，许多原来工作很落后的、没有生气的村庄或其他单位，一经推行
    “爱国检查日”制度，提高了人民群众的政治觉悟之后，便一变而为工作先进的、政治生活沸沸腾腾的村庄或单位了。
    我们认为，“爱国检查日”制度是可以而且应该在全国各地普遍推行的，是应该在农村及城市居民中推行的。自去年普遍深入地开展了抗美援朝爱国主义教育以后，全国人民曾有半数以上订立了爱国公约。爱国公约在全国人民的增产节约运动、捐献武器运动、做好优抚工作、开展政治文化学习等方面都起了重大的推动和保证作用。现在，我们的祖国即将开始大规模的、有计划的建设工作；同时，由于美国侵略者坚持继续并企图扩大朝鲜战争，我们又必须在进行大规模建设工作的同时继续加强抗美援朝的工作。为了继续加强支援志愿军的工作，为了更好地组织人民群众投身于祖国的建设事业，全国各地都应该发动人民群众普遍地检查、修订爱国公约，根据当前任务不断地更新自己的爱国行动纲领。而推行“爱国检查日”制度，正是组织人民群众经常地按期地检查、修订爱国公约最好的办法。据了解，许多地区在推行爱国公约运动中的形式主义毛病始终没有很好地克服，最近并且放松了对爱国公约的领导；另一些地区则苦于难以使时事政治宣传工作保持经常化，宣传工作“冷一阵、热一阵”。对解决这些问题，推行“爱国检查日”将是对症下药的有效方法。
    在推行“爱国检查日”制度时，各地党的领导机关应该作好计划，有步骤有重点地逐步推广。首先应教育干部，使他们明了“爱国检查日”的意义和作用，做好准备工作。然后组织并加强宣传力量
    （最好采取“包干宣传”的方式），在全体居民中进行宣传，发动大家都来参加这种活动。每次“爱国检查日”举行之前，党的支部委员会应确定活动中心，通过宣传人员发动群众围绕这个中心检查自己执行爱国公约（包括抗美援朝工作、国家所规定的各项工作任务、生产任务和学习任务等）的情况，作为参加大会的准备工作。这样有准备、有中心地展开活动，才能使“爱国检查日”能在比较短的时间内集中解决主要问题，避免开会时间过长，而不能解决主要问题的毛病。每次“爱国检查日”活动中都应有适当的时事政治宣传及生产宣传，但这种宣传必须简明扼要，避免长篇大论，占去群众发言的时间。另外，文化娱乐活动的节目必须短小精悍，而且要严格地控制时间，以防止因过多的文化娱乐活动而妨碍检查、讨论工作和进行时事、政治宣传。至于“爱国检查日”集会的范围，在农村以村庄为单位（居住十分集中的可以乡为单位）、在城市居民中以公安派出所辖区为单位，比较适宜；举行的时间，以半个月一次为比较适宜。
