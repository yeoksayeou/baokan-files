The Marriage Law Brings Happiness to Dongguan Village
Yu Like

Among the 130-plus peasant households in Dongguan Village, First District, Nangong County, Hebei Province, more than 120 households share the surname Guan. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the village's Communist Party members and propagandists have continuously promoted and explained the Marriage Law at meetings and on blackboards, gradually eliminating the masses' misunderstandings about it. However, when it came to implementing the Marriage Law, the masses always said: Our village is practically all one family, it can't be implemented.

This year in May, the free engagement of Youth League members Guan Qingshen and Guan Yongdie (female) broke the deadlock in Dongguan Village, and the Marriage Law began to be implemented. The families of Guan Qingshen and Guan Yongdie had long organized mutual aid teams, and this year they absorbed Xu Huayu, turning into a year-round work-point recording mutual aid team. Qingshen's family farmed eleven mu of land, with only him and his sixty-seven-year-old father. Yongdie's family also had only three people. Her father, Guan Cihang, was a veteran village-level cadre who had worked for more than ten years, and her mother was chronically ill. The production on the twelve mu of land mainly relied on Yongdie. Although Yongdie was skilled in all kinds of field work, she was ultimately not as strong as Qingshen. But when it came to needlework, Qingshen knew nothing about it. Every day after returning from the fields, Qingshen would take time to carry water and clean the pens for Yongdie's family... Yongdie would also do some needlework for Qingshen. At first, this work was also recorded, but later it became impossible to keep track. In the past, they addressed each other by their generation, but gradually they called each other "comrade," and then simply by their names. Before the "May Fourth" Youth Day this year, the Youth League branch assigned study tasks, one of which was to study the "Marriage Law." They had studied the Marriage Law before, but only paid attention to Articles 3 and 4. This time, however, they both repeatedly studied Article 5. When Yongdie studied this article, she thought to herself: Direct blood relatives are prohibited from marrying, so can distant relatives of different generations marry? She answered herself: If it's not prohibited, then it's allowed. When Qingshen studied this article, he considered that his family and Yongdie's family had been beyond the fifth generation, so it was possible for them... But in the past, no one in this village with the same surname had married each other, and they felt that the masses would certainly disapprove.

One day in mid-May, Qingshen carried wheat to the mill. Yongdie's mother saw him on the street and shouted to Yongdie when she returned home: "Die! Go to the mill and grind wheat with Qingshen! He can't manage it alone." In the past, Yongdie would automatically go when Qingshen's family had work to do, but today she went reluctantly, waiting until her mother urged her again before going. Only Qingshen and the ox-drawn mill were humming in the mill shed. When Qingshen saw Yongdie go, he didn't know why, but his face began to heat up. In the past, when they worked together, regardless of whether there were others around, they would constantly talk about study, propaganda, production, and so on; but today, no one took the initiative to speak. It turned out that both of them were thinking about Article 5 of the Marriage Law. Later, Yongdie was the first to ask, "Have you finished studying the Marriage Law?" Qingshen thought for a long time before answering, "I've studied it, but Article 5..." Yongdie paused for a while and said, "That's right, we need to find someone to explain Article 5." As she spoke, she took the Marriage Law out of her pocket. Qingshen reached out and took it, saying, "If you don't understand that article, I'll explain it to you!" But Yongdie couldn't say anything, and lowered her head to sift the flour. After Qingshen urged her repeatedly, Yongdie still lowered her head and only said half a sentence: "Can people with the same surname..." Qingshen repeatedly recited the first item of Article 5 twice, saying, "According to the provisions of the Marriage Law, why can't they? It's just..." Yongdie interrupted and asked, "Just what?" Qingshen was forced to say, "I'm just afraid of your father..." Yongdie rolled her eyes at him and said, "Don't think of my father as so backward, I'm just afraid of your father..." Hearing this, Qingshen grew bolder, reached out and held Yongdie's hand, saying, "My father always praises you: good worker, good temperament... If I could marry a daughter-in-law like you, he'd be so happy he couldn't close his mouth!" They were so busy talking that the mill wasn't grinding flour properly.

Yongdie told her parents about her and Qingshen. Her father immediately expressed his approval, and her mother also said, "Qingshen is honest, intelligent, and thrifty."

When Qingshen told his father, the old man was indeed so happy he couldn't close his mouth, and advocated getting married soon. Qingshen told him, "Yongdie is seventeen years old, and I'm nineteen. We can't get married until the New Year!" The old man listened and said, "I've never lived my life according to the solar calendar, but this time I have to follow the solar calendar. You'll get married after the solar New Year!"

The young men and women in the village all liked this matter and praised them for opening up a path for the men and women of Dongguan Village. But some older people disapproved of their engagement. In order to implement the Marriage Law, the Dongguan Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the Youth League branch decided that all Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists should carry out the work of publicizing the Marriage Law using the engagement of Qingshen and Yongdie as practical material.

In this village, there was a lone widow, Guan Qi, who had been a widow since she was twenty-five years old, and was now thirty-eight years old. In the past, the people in the village constantly praised this widow for her "righteousness" in remaining a widow, but every time Qi heard this, she secretly shed tears: "Who has ever seen the pain of thirteen years in my heart!" Guan Qinglian, who lived in the front yard of Guan Qi's house, called Guan Qi "aunt" in terms of generation, but was a very distant relative. Guan Qinglian had six children, and his wife died the year before last. Because he had so many children, he had not been able to remarry. Qinglian couldn't take care of both the fields and the family on his own, and he complained about having too many children when he was worried. Guan Qi was very fond of the children of any family she saw, especially Qinglian's motherless children. At first, she gave the children some food, and later she constantly made several pairs of shoes for the children. Later, Qinglian bought foreign cloth, and Guan Qi made clothes for them. Qinglian also took on the work in Guan Qi's few mu of land, as well as fetching water and repairing the mud house... After the two families helped each other like this, Guan Qi's thoughts of remarrying became stronger and stronger; Qinglian had also suffered enough from the problem of the children's clothing and shoes, and his desire to remarry became more and more urgent. In the past, the people in the village joked with Qinglian, "Find your aunt (referring to Guan Qi)!" Although Qinglian was very willing in his heart, he still had to oppose it angrily. The women also said to Guan Qi: You find Qinglian, it would be great if your two families were combined! Although Guan Qi agreed very much in her heart, she still had to refute it on the surface.

The engagement of Qingshen and Yongdie and the publicity of the Marriage Law made Guan Qi and Qinglian bolder. They discussed it and secretly called the village chief Xu Yunsheng to their home to ask if they could get married. The village chief immediately replied, "You are distant relatives, so it's completely possible!" The next day, they went to the district to register and got married on the same day they returned. The wedding was new-style, and the village branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the village chief, and other cadres all attended the wedding. While everyone was happy, Guan Qi shed tears in front of everyone and said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's Marriage Law, I would have died of depression in another two years."

The Marriage Law has been implemented in Dongguan Village, and Guan Jingui, a demobilized soldier from the west of the village, has also freely and independently engaged with Guan Yongyu, a young female laborer from the east of the village. Many young women have also dared to say that they are in love with someone from a certain village at the folk school in Beizhuang and are preparing to register for marriage.

It's autumn harvest, and the benefits of the Marriage Law are becoming more and more obvious. The average yield of cotton per mu in Qingshen's and Yongdie's families was more than 170 jin, and they were both selected as production models and learning models. Qinglian and Guan Qi planted thirty-two mu of cotton and harvested more than 4,600 jin in total. Last year, their two families' cotton yield was less than 70 jin per mu.

    婚姻法给东关家庄带来了幸福
    于力克
    河北省南宫县一区东关家庄的一百三十多户农民中，有一百二十来户都姓关。婚姻法颁布以来，村里的共产党员和宣传员在大会上、黑板报上曾不断宣传、讲解婚姻法，逐渐消除了群众对婚姻法的误解。但一提到实行婚姻法，群众却总是说：咱村净一姓一家的，没法实行。
    今年五月间，青年团员关清申和关永蝶（女）的自由订婚，打破了东关家庄的局面，婚姻法开始贯彻了。关清申和关永蝶两家，早就组织了互助组，今年又吸收了徐化雨，变成了常年记工互助组。清申家种地十一亩，全家只有他和他六十七岁的父亲两个人。永蝶家也只有三口人。她父亲关慈航是一个工作了十多年的老村级干部，母亲常年有病，十二亩地里的生产主要依靠永蝶。永蝶虽然地里活什么都会，但要比起劳力来，终究还不如清申。可是论起针线活，清申就一窍不通了。清申每天从地里回来，就抽空给永蝶家担水、除圈……永蝶也给清申作些针线活。开始时这些活也记着工，后来记也记不清了。过去他俩都按辈称呼，后来逐渐互称同志，再以后就干脆只喊名字了。今年“五四”青年节前，团支部布置了学习任务，其中有一项是学“婚姻法”。过去他们也都学习过婚姻法，可是只注意第三条和第四条。这次他俩却都反复地研究起第五条来了。永蝶学习到这一条，心里暗想：直系血亲禁止结婚，那么远门的不一辈是否能结婚呢？自己又替自己答：既不禁止就是能。清申学习到这一条，就考虑和永蝶家早就五代以外了，我俩有可能……但过去这个村里一姓和一姓结婚的没有一个，他们觉得群众一定看不惯。
    在五月中旬的一天，清申扛着麦子去磨面。永蝶的母亲在街上看见了，回到家里就喊永蝶：“蝶！你上磨上去和清申磨面去吧！他一个人顾不过来。”往日清申家有活，永蝶都是自动去，今天却去得不痛快，直等母亲又催促了一次才去了。磨棚里只有清申一个人和牛拉的磨呼呼地响。清申见永蝶去了，不知怎的脸上发起热来。往日他俩在一起作活，不论有无旁人，什么学习啦，宣传啦，生产啦，话总是不断；可是今天谁也不主动说话了。原来两个人都在想婚姻法上的第五条。后来还是永蝶先开口问：“你把婚姻法学完了吗？”清申想了好久才答出：“学是学完了，就是第五条……”永蝶沉了一会也说：“可不是，就是第五条得找人给解释解释。”她一面说着，一面把那本婚姻法从兜袋里掏了出来。清申伸手接过来说：“那条不明白我给你解释解释吧！”可是永蝶却说不出来，低下头去又箩起面来。经过清申的再三催促，永蝶仍然低着头只说了半句：“一姓能不能……”清申又把第五条的第一项反复念了两遍说：“根据婚姻法的规定，有什么不能？只是……。”永蝶抢着问：“只是什么？”清申被她逼着说出了：“只是怕你父亲……”永蝶反白了他一眼说：“你别把我父亲看得那样不进步，只是怕你父亲……”清申听到这里，大了胆子，伸手握住了永蝶的手说：“我父亲哪天不夸你：活好、性情好……要娶上你这样的儿媳妇，喜得还能合得上嘴！”他俩只顾说话，磨都不漏面了。
    永蝶把她和清申的事告诉了父母。她父亲马上表示赞成，她母亲也说：“清申又忠厚，又聪明，又勤俭。”
    清申给他爹一说，老头子果然喜得合不上嘴，主张最近就结婚。清申告诉他，永蝶十七岁，我十九岁，过年才能结婚呢！”老头听了说：“我一辈子过日子没按过阳历，这回得按阳历，过了阳历年你们就结婚吧！”
    村里的男女青年们对这件事没有不喜欢的，都称赞他俩给东关家庄的男女们创开了道。可是有一些上年纪的人却对他俩的订婚看不惯。为了贯彻执行婚姻法，中共东关家庄支部、青年团支部决定全体党员、团员、宣传员展开以清申、永蝶订婚为实际材料的宣传婚姻法工作。
    这村里有个孤身寡妇关齐氏，从二十五岁守寡，今年三十八岁了。过去村里的人们不断夸这个寡妇守得“正气”，可是齐氏每听到这话，就暗地里掉泪：“十三年的痛苦谁到我心里看过呀！”关寡妇前院住的关清莲，论辈数管关齐氏叫婶子，但已是很远的当家子了。关清莲有六个小孩，大前年死了老婆，因为孩子多，一直没能续娶。清莲一个人顾了地里顾不上家里，上了愁就抱怨孩子太多。关寡妇不管看见谁家的孩子，都是亲得不得了，特别是对清莲家这些没娘的孩子更亲。开始给孩子点吃的，以后不断地给孩子做几双鞋，再以后清莲买了洋布，关寡妇就替他们做衣服。关寡妇的几亩地里的活，以及吃水、泥房……清莲也就担当起来。两家这样互助起来以后，关寡妇改嫁的思想越来越上升；清莲也早受够了孩子们穿衣穿鞋问题的苦，再娶个老婆的要求也越来越迫切。过去村里人们给清莲开玩笑说：“你寻了你婶子（指关齐氏）吧！”清莲虽心里十分愿意，但还得生气似地反对。妇女们也对关寡妇说过：你寻了清莲吧，你们两家一合该多好！关寡妇心里虽十分同意，但表面上还不得不反驳。
    清申、永蝶订婚的事和婚姻法的宣传，使关寡妇和清莲胆子大了。他俩商量好，暗中把村长徐云升叫到家里，问问他俩能不能结婚。村长马上回答：“你们这么远门的当家子完全可以！”第二天他俩到区里登记，回来当天结了婚。结婚是新式的，中共村支部书记、村长等干部都参加了婚礼。大家正在高兴的时候，关寡妇却当着大家掉下泪来，说：“要没有毛主席的婚姻法，我再过二年就郁闷死了。”
    婚姻法在东关家庄实行起来了，村西头的转业军人关金贵，也和东头的青年劳动妇女关永玉自由自主地订了婚。有不少的青年妇女，也都敢说出在北庄的民校里和某村某人正在进行恋爱，准备登记结婚等等。
    秋收了，婚姻法的好处越明显了。清申和永蝶家的棉花每亩平均收了一百七十多斤，他俩都被选为生产模范和学习模范。清莲和关寡妇种了三十二亩棉花，共收了四千六百多斤，去年他两家的棉花每亩收不到七十斤。
