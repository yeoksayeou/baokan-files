    We Return from Korea
    By Chen Yi, Deputy Head of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

    Dear Comrades and Friends:

    Bearing the glorious mission you entrusted to us, we went to Korea again this year. As your representatives, we did very little. But the concern you have for the front lines, the concern you have for your own children, we did our best to convey it all. The comrades at the front thank you, and your own children thank you as well. On one hand, they were very excited (some were so excited they shed tears) to receive every item of comfort we brought, shouting "Motherland—my mother!"; on the other hand, they felt ashamed that the task entrusted to them by the motherland was not fully completed. In fact, this is entirely their modesty. A squad of soldiers placed the comforts sent by the motherland on the position, asking each other, as if conducting a self-criticism: "Can I eat this candy?" "Am I qualified to smoke this cigarette?" "Have I completed my mission?" Holding the enamel cup engraved with the words "Presented to the Most Beloved People," the soldiers swore one after another: "Since the motherland calls us the most beloved people, we must do the most beloved things for the motherland." One soldier in another squad ate the candy first. When he saw others still taking candy for self-criticism, he immediately held up the candy bag and said to everyone: "You say, eat a piece of candy, kill an enemy. I've already eaten the candy. I'm determined to keep this candy bag with me forever. After I kill an enemy, I'll pick up a small stone and put it in, until I collect one hundred and twenty-six stones, the same number as the original candies, and take it back to the motherland as a family heirloom." He used this determination to do the most beloved things for the motherland, just like his comrades.

    We met many people like this. They all said in unison: "Thank you, motherland, thank you, Chairman Mao, for sending our loved ones. We haven't seen our loved ones in two years." They wished they had wings to fly and welcome their loved ones. "Loved ones," what a sincere term! To receive us, these "loved ones," even Commander Peng Dehuai's car was driven to Andong. Heroes and meritorious individuals personally drove the cars, some even brought ambulances. To ensure that we, these "loved ones," had a relatively safe and comfortable life, many units vacated their best air-raid shelters. Our general delegation had over three hundred people, and they vacated accommodations for over three hundred people for us. And their three hundred people (actually far more than that, because they were living in cramped conditions) had to move to other places. And those other places were naturally not as safe as the original places.

    However, this was how they treated "loved ones"! They were just like on the front line, without any concerns.

    Some units, hearing that we, these "loved ones," were coming, searched the mountains around their residence for days, hunting for spies, fearing that a hidden spy might send a signal, exposing the target, and affecting us. Some units specially built auditoriums to prepare to listen to our reports and watch our performances. Think about it, if we didn't report well or perform well, how could we face them? I went to a place ×× li away from the front line. It was a military headquarters. The auditorium was called "Advance," thirty meters long and twelve meters wide. In addition to the stage and audience seating, there were dressing rooms and music rooms. The engineering company, with less than a hundred workers, completed it in just forty days. During the construction, the leaders and engineers studied together, first designed it, measured the dimensions accurately, worked in the forest, and then moved it back and put it together to complete the auditorium. Standing inside, one simply couldn't imagine that this was the front line. However, all the equipment was handled according to the needs of the war environment. Enemy planes couldn't see it in the sky, enemy artillery was blocked by the mountains, and there were also five emergency exits inside. In case of an emergency, one could come out from the emergency exits and follow the communication trench (the communication trench also had transverse walls) to a safe place. And don't forget, we also had anti-aircraft guns.

    Some units, even the companies at the forefront of the tunnels, because they had heard that the returning representatives of the Volunteers were carried from the station to the hotel by the people of the motherland, they also carried their "loved ones" from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain.

    As for food, those who experienced it will know that they really treated us like honored guests, taking out everything they had. We visited Luo Shengjiao's company, and the soldiers specially prepared a rich dinner for us. Some of our comrades had a total of four quilts and blankets, plus the fiery hearts of the comrades at the front. Wouldn't that be warm enough?

    Moreover, when we went, it was precisely when the front line was launching a full-scale counterattack. The comrades vied to "fight victorious battles and make great contributions" to welcome the "loved ones" sent by the motherland, to respond to the deep feelings of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. One unit even captured prisoners and brought them to us personally as a gift.

    Dear Comrades and Friends: Is there anything more intimate, more ardent, more noble, more honorable than this? Having received such intimate, such ardent, such noble, such honorable treatment, what else can we say? "Thank you," "Thank you," "Thank you," we can't find more appropriate words to say. Then came handshakes and hugs, customs that hadn't been customary for thousands of years. Regardless of gender, age, everyone hugged on the Korean front. This was a passionate embrace, an embrace of the hearts of the people of the motherland and the Volunteers, our most beloved people. Old men, like Zhang Jihui's father, Zhang Benzhou, and Dong Cunrui's father, Dong Quanzhong, smiled non-stop for more than forty days in Korea. Kind fathers, representing the fathers of thousands of Volunteer soldiers, everyone considered it a blessing to see them. Some units that didn't see them even sent telegrams to ask them to go. Look, from them, borrowing the words of the soldiers, "You can see the motherland, you can see your own parents, you can see Chairman Mao." No wonder some soldiers who were sent from hundreds of miles away to welcome the慰问团 (comfort delegation) shook hands with the representatives of the comfort delegation, didn't wash their hands for three days, and insisted on returning to the company, the regiment, the division, and shaking hands with every soldier who hadn't seen the comfort delegation before considering their mission completed and their duty fulfilled.

    How enthusiastic! Only the people taught by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have this enthusiasm, only they are worthy of this enthusiasm.

    Thinking, thinking, the more I think about it, the more I feel that we ourselves, whether at the front or in the motherland, have indeed done too little. If there is anything we haven't done or haven't done well in our work, we feel deeply ashamed.

    Recalling May 4th last year, when we left the Volunteer Army headquarters, it was a very foggy day. The leaders of the Volunteer Army headquarters told us: "Good, today the weather is good, you can hurry on the road, this is a good opportunity." The so-called good opportunity meant that we could travel without fear of enemy air raids and pass through the blockade line relatively safely. These few words can summarize the situation of the journey at that time. This year, we visited the Yigu River front line. We looked at Tieyuan from the top of the mountain. When we went down the mountain, it was already broad daylight. We got into the car at 7:30. That place was only seven li away from the enemy, and enemy planes had already begun to appear in the sky. But apart from the deputy political commissar of the division asking our car to disguise itself and arranging for the people in the car to monitor the enemy planes, the small jeep drove back quickly. Did anyone worry about enemy artillery shelling? Some people were indeed concerned, but the soldiers who were sending us off said: "It's okay, this isn't their area." This meant that the enemy artillery couldn't blockade this place. You say, relying on the soldiers, relying on their composure, bravery, and intelligence, what do we have to worry about? Following the wide and flat mountain road that the soldiers at the front themselves had built, we safely returned to the division headquarters. Although we encountered enemy planes twice on the way, on the one hand, everyone was monitoring them and had spotted them from afar; on the other hand, the driver was skillful and found places to hide along the way. It seemed that the enemy planes hadn't seen us.

    Counting, from May last year to October this year, it's only been seventeen months, and the changes are so great. This is just from the small matter of traveling. But dear comrades and friends: In Korea, traveling is a major event. If the road isn't good, it greatly affects our war. Last year, although our motherland's financial and economic situation hadn't completely improved, the people of the whole country tightened their belts and still provided good assistance to our Volunteer Army. The problem was that the road wasn't good, and we hadn't won the battle on the transportation front. The first time we crossed the Yalu River Bridge, the bridge was bombed. Seeing our journey hindered, we felt very anxious, but more importantly, seeing so many supplies and ammunition unable to cross the river, this was what truly worried the heroes who were resisting the enemy with their flesh and blood on the front line. This year is different. This bridge has our air force protecting it in the sky and our anti-aircraft guns protecting it on the ground. It stands majestically, without any damage. Relying on it, the blood vessels of the motherland and our Volunteer Army are tightly connected.

    Is it just this one bridge? No. Countless bridges are like this. The enemy has never relaxed its efforts to destroy these transportation channels. The problem is that we resolutely, skillfully, and constantly oppose these enemy destructions. Where there is no air force or where the air force doesn't go often, we rely on ground anti-aircraft fire, rely on the precise calculations of railway transportation, and especially rely on our railway troops who are not afraid of the cold, who go into the water at thirty degrees below zero to repair bridges. They use superhuman perseverance and intelligence to anticipate the places the enemy might destroy, pre-design, pre-construct materials, pre-build bridge piers and bridge decks, and wait in the predetermined places. Once it is destroyed, they move it over and put it up, thus ensuring that no time is wasted. So the soldiers and workers are very confident and say: "Bomb, you can't bomb it; if you bomb it, we can repair it."

    Relying on this determination, confidence, and skillful methods of fighting the enemy, the bridge always stands; the train always runs; supplies and ammunition can be continuously transported to the front line. The "strangulation warfare" against the transportation lines that the enemy boasted about has been deflated in the face of these heroes. We have won a great victory in this regard.

    The comrades of the air defense哨 (sentry post) also played a particularly important role in winning this victory. Along the highway, comrades, listen and see: "Whistle sounds," "gunshots," "white flag," "red flag," guiding thousands of drivers "lights on, advance!" "lights off, advance!" This greatly increased the transportation rate of cars and greatly reduced the accidents of our cars. In September this year, only one car was destroyed by enemy planes on the entire road. The soldiers were not satisfied and even put forward the fighting slogan of "no accidents for a hundred days."

    Relying on these heroes on the transportation front, the Volunteer Army's cotton-padded clothes were all transported in three days this year (please note, only three days) without any loss. No wonder our soldiers were already wearing cotton-padded clothes early, while the American troops were still shivering! No wonder the captured American pilots asked: "Are your cars all equipped with radar?" Our soldiers answered well: "Fool, our country's industry can't afford to install it, we're installing human radar." We rely on this "human radar" to make the American imperialist air force suffer. The comrades of the air defense哨 (sentry post) are already very skilled. They can all distinguish: what sound the enemy plane makes, what kind of plane it is, what action it wants to take; for our own cars, they can tell even without seeing them: what brand it is, large or small, empty or fully loaded. They rely on this to direct and carry out the air defense struggle on the highway.

    But the enemy can never find them, and they also take the initiative to attack! Once, near Wu Kaili, they shot down an enemy plane. An American lieutenant colonel pilot parachuted down and was discovered by an air defense哨 (sentry post). Soldiers Ma Derong and another soldier hurried forward, running more than twenty li. Ma Derong was so tired that he vomited blood, but still couldn't find him. But they would never give up on the prey that was already in the hands of our soldiers. They fired their guns and searched for a long time. Finally, they found him in front of a large tree. The lieutenant colonel had already knelt on the ground, waiting to be liberated according to the old rules of surrendering used by the American army. Just then, eighteen enemy planes came and circled around them, strafing and bombing. After a while, a helicopter flew over and a ladder was lowered from the helicopter. The lieutenant colonel was both surprised and delighted when he saw it. He turned around and wanted to leave. The two soldiers pulled him back. He hurriedly took out American dollars, pens, and even a photo of his wife from his body, and handed them to our soldiers, wanting our soldiers to let him go. How could our soldiers agree? They still pulled him hard and pointed their guns at him. The helicopter flew for a while and disappeared; the large group of enemy planes approached again, strafing and bombing. It was very fierce. It seemed that they couldn't control this guy. The two soldiers had no choice but to look down and see the rope on the parachute. They suddenly became smart, cut the rope with a bayonet, and tied the guy to a tree not far away, unable to move. They chose a place to hide, aiming their guns while hiding. The helicopter came again, and the ladder was lowered as before, but after a long, long time, seeing that there was still no one there, it seemed to let out a "whistle" and quickly flew away, and the large group of enemy planes followed. That guy—the lieutenant colonel, dejected, also obediently followed our soldiers back.

    Relying on these smart and brave soldiers, under the command of their smart commanders, the American military's "air superiority" on the highway was gradually defeated.

    This importance is immeasurable. Recalling the time of "a handful of fried flour and a handful of snow" last year, at that time the letters the soldiers asked us to bring back to the motherland were "I don't miss home, I don't miss my wife; I just want to eat a hot steamed bun." "As long as the guns have food, the artillery has food, and the wounded can be carried down for treatment, we are guaranteed to defeat the American devils." That was the situation last year. This year, the soldiers are all praising the logistics work. This shows that the difficult and arduous situation imposed on us by the enemy, like MacArthur's rolling away, is gone forever. Now there is not a lack of things at the front, but a lack of places to put things; now there is not a lack of transportation capacity, but the transportation capacity is already surplus. The railways and highways both have a set of relatively mature experiences to use.

    I solemnly inform the American warmongers, let you see: even the Chinese and Korean people in the rear (this is only in relation to the front-line troops) cannot be bullied by you. Let us turn back and talk about the front line, dear comrades and friends.

    What impressed us most was that the residences of all levels on the front line were so peaceful, and this peace was not recklessness or numbness, but each aspect had a plan. We followed a certain army commander to their army headquarters. Although we arrived at night, it was completely different from the way it was when we went to their place last year. Last year, asking about one of their residences, including Koreans and Chinese, we asked for a total of four hours, and the alarm was sounded more than ten times in four hours. After getting off the car this year, air defense guns were also fired a few times, but the order was very good. As soon as the gun was fired, everything became silent. The soldiers skillfully moved things up the mountain in the dark. I visited their office that night, all with electric lights and wooden floors, and all stored various tables, chairs and benches made by their own engineers. When I got up early the next day, I looked around for a while, my eyes looking at all aspects of this command post, my ears listening to the sound of enemy planes flying around again after more than ten minutes, I looked at the staff in the operations room, listened to the sound of telephone calls coming and going, and also watched the several military leaders sitting at the door of the office talking and basking in the sun. How calm and orderly they were!

    But the enemy could not find them, because they were building their command post according to the front line, according to the war, and especially according to striving for the victory of the war.

    We have been to two division headquarters, and it was the same. When we arrived, they had already lit the stoves they made with their own hands on the battlefield, and were using charcoal they burned themselves for warmth. What surprised us was not these living facilities, but the division commander's desk was full of books, including military books, political books, and especially various dictionaries. The division commander was so busy and tired in combat, but he still took the time to study culture. In the Liberation War, he had served as a deputy regimental commander, and now he was a division commander. They always take some time to study every day. He told us: "In modern warfare, you can't do without learning!" So they were desperately reading the Soviet Army's "Combat Regulations" and "Combined Tactics". Combined with their practical combat experience, they read faster and understood more deeply.

    But they also paid attention to their bodies, and they also knew how to play. As seen in a soldier's wall newspaper: "Work well, study well, fight well, eat well, play well, be healthy, only then can we win battles." Of course, it is difficult to fully achieve these in the war zone. The comrades at the front, even the comrades in the tunnels, are working towards this goal. The division commander split the auxiliary fuel tank dropped by the enemy planes in half and made boats. After fighting and working, they found a place with water and rowed and played.

    This situation is the same even in the company. When we meet, they are always very happy. After the battle, they study, repair their fortifications, and sometimes help Koreans with their work. Sometimes they cut a deck of cards in half to make two decks for everyone to play. I saw an engineer blowing a harmonica after nervously pushing the ferry away from the shore. When asked about the enemy's situation, they always said: "It's okay, we are still far away from the enemy here!" In fact, the fireballs of enemy and our machine guns intersecting at night swept past our eyes one after another. Sometimes the enemy artillery fired too much and landed on the mountainside and in the open fields. The soldiers said: "This is your Truman's warehouse, you bring all the shells here!" A soldier named Tian Jizhong specially wrote a comic dialogue poem for Truman to ridicule the enemy's random shelling. "American soldiers, really ridiculous, shooting randomly with shells every day; I don't know if they calculate how many shells they shoot with one gun every day? We squatted in the fortifications, studying, playing chess, singing songs, scraping the grass and trees on the mountain bare, Truman is a barber."

    This rare calmness enables each of our commanders and fighters to maintain a clear mind, and all creativity comes from this clarity.

    Last year, some people were still worried about whether the Korean War could continue. If the war were to be protracted, how could it be sustained? This year, these problems have been solved. The soldiers said: "American imperialism, if you want to fight for how long, we will accompany you for how long." Last year, an American journalist ridiculed us and said: "The Volunteer Army is fighting with five days of dry food on their backs. When the dry food is gone, they go back." This means that our transportation lines are not sound and that food and ammunition cannot be transported. Today, American journalists should ridicule themselves. Our Volunteer Army warriors no longer worry about food and ammunition, and 70% of what they eat is fine grains. As for ammunition, please listen to the American imperialists' own statements after the Battle of Shangganling.

    Last year, when we were fighting defensive battles on the south bank of the Han River, we built field fortifications, but sometimes they couldn't withstand the enemy's planes and artillery. The soldiers felt that they needed to think of other ways. After the Fifth Battle, the commanders, based on the creations of the soldiers, gave play to the glorious tradition of diligence and bravery of the people of the motherland, and dug tunnel fortifications. This kind of tunnel fortification stretches for hundreds of miles from the Linjin River in the west to the east coast. The soldiers call it the "Underground Great Wall". Soldier Yong Jianhua once had a comic dialogue poem praising it: "Tunnels are strong, tunnels are strong, they are the king of all fortifications, planes and artillery can't penetrate them, thousands of troops and horses are hidden inside." According to statistics, the wood used to build the fortifications could be arranged from Korea all the way to Chongqing. Digging earth and opening mountains, digging empty countless mountains; some units spent millions of workdays to build fortifications, but the soldiers did not have any modern tools, they relied on their hands. Some soldiers hit four thousand hammer blows a day just to drill stone holes, some hit eight thousand to ten thousand hammer blows. The soldiers used this intensity of labor to fight nature and fight stubborn stones just like they fought American imperialism. They said: "Determined to grind the stones to pieces, difficulties worry about seeing me, determination is harder than stone, emotions are higher than mountains." In this way, the soldiers had a home, and this home is the "position home" that we all know. Relying on this home, they preserved themselves, defended against the enemy, and counterattacked the enemy.

    There is no unbreakable defense line in the world, but the defense line built by the Volunteer Army cannot be broken by the enemy, because this defense line is not only solid in construction, but more importantly, it has people like the Volunteer Army, people educated by Mao Zedong Thought, to defend it. Because modern warfare is not only about being brave, having determination, and using artillery, but also about fighting tactics, being smart, and having methods. The Volunteer Army has all six aspects. The Battle of Shangganling showed that with fortifications and artillery, there must also be people and methods thought out by people.

    The American imperialists and the Li Chen-gwan (Syngman Rhee) gang were not short of soldiers, nor were their artillery not fierce, but their people were not determined or brave, and they could not think of better methods than us. Of course, the nature of the war also determined that it was difficult for them to be determined and brave, so it was also difficult for them to think of better methods than us. Please see a poem popular in the American army. The name of this poem is "Dedicated to Korea".

    "Below the border of the Soviet Union and China, is the place of Korea. That is the place where we are destined to serve—a place forgotten by God.

    "Fighting mosquitoes with automatic rifles, digging earth with cross shovels, doing the work of ancient slaves, is so tiring!

    "With snakes and scorpions, in a place where people become extremely frustrated, in a foreign land nine thousand miles away from you.

    "We suffer from cold, sweat, and shiver, which is unbearable for us; but we are still not criminals, we are the defenders of our God!

    "We are Marines, earning meager salaries, protecting millionaires, only one dollar and six cents a day.

    "Waiting with memories of our first meeting with our girlfriends, hoping that they will not marry other lads while we are away from home.

    "No one knows we are alive, no one cares in the slightest, we have been forgotten by our families, we are also Americans.

    "During our time in the Marines, we missed the most precious time, children, don't let the draft catch you, for God's sake, don't join the army again.

    "When our work is done, and we go to that familiar place, Saint Peter will say: 'They are from Korea, they have spent their time in hell.'

    "A saying that is circulating: our duty is not to ask 'why', but to 'do', to 'die'!"

    This is the mood of the American army! Plus our fortifications, borrowing the words of the soldiers, are "sitting north and facing south", that is, living in the tunnel, you see the sun less, but you can always see it; while the enemy is "sitting south and facing north", only eating north wind. The soldiers said: "Just this point, the enemy has lost."

    Last year, because our tunnel fortifications had not been well established, the enemy relied on his so-called air and artillery cover, which was quite fierce, and sometimes even danced in front of the tanks. When the superiors called for a cold gun and cold炮 (artillery) campaign, the soldiers said: "This method is good, killing ten to see the division commander, killing twenty to see the army commander, killing one hundred to see Chairman Mao." In this way, they shot whenever the enemy showed his head, wherever he showed his head, they shot there; they shot while looking at the terrain in a car; they shot while going to the toilet; they shot while gathering for meals. They shot the enemy so that he dared not show his head all day long. Therefore, a saying is now popular in the American army called "lower your head", especially when the veterans see the new soldiers walking with their heads held high, they press on their necks: "Lower your head!" Our soldiers feel that fighting this kind of battle is very cheap, and the more they fight, the more interested they become. During the rainy season, because it was closer to the enemy and not easy to hide, one soldier took off all his clothes, smeared his whole body with thin yellow mud in the rain, and crawled on the ground to ambush the enemy.

    Later, this cold枪 (gun) battle became more and more extensive. Rifles touched the enemy's rear to shoot, and artillery cooperated with rifles to shoot.

    Due to learning, due to practical combat, and due to summarizing the creations of the soldiers, our commanders have also become smarter than before. In the past, they only knew how to command infantry, or only knew how to lead a platoon or a company to charge; now a regimental commander, in addition to commanding infantry, must also command tanks and artillery. And the organization of various calibers of artillery, just the organization of the task of transporting ammunition by car, is extremely complicated in the combat environment. Many of our victories today are inseparable from the intelligence and progress of our various commanders. If in the past they only knew simple infantry-artillery coordination, today they can organize very well and use freely many kinds of artillery—field artillery, mountain artillery, tank artillery, mortar fire, and the artillery that our people's army started with—炸药(explosives). And when these are to be decided, they always conduct thorough investigations and studies and prepare various preparations in advance. Finally, even the lowest-level commanders feel confident before they act. An army commander told us: "We don't have much experience in modern warfare, so we should be especially cautious." Their spirit of being responsible to the motherland, to the people, and especially to the lives of the soldiers deeply moved us. The war has made them even smarter. The smarter they are, the smarter the soldiers are, and the dumber the enemy seems. The war situation is thus becoming more and more favorable to us.

    Do they have hardships? Yes. The soldiers said: "Not seeing the motherland for two years is the greatest hardship." Therefore, it is very important for the people of the motherland to visit them often, to communicate with them, to tell them every new thing you have seen in the motherland. This is a great encouragement and comfort to them.

    Especially the soldiers in the tunnels, they are humid, lack sunlight, and the air is not good. They face mountains and trees every day. Some troops, when fighting, have no water to drink, and even drank urine. It should be said that this is very difficult. The soldiers call "sunlight, air, vegetables" the "three treasures", and what we see is that "sunlight, air", "vegetables, tobacco leaves", and "art troupes" are the three essential elements in their lives and battles. Our motherland should first satisfy them in these three aspects.

    Comrade Deng Hua, on behalf of the entire Volunteer Army, proposed to us: I hope that our motherland will build well. Now the war requires white flour, rice, plus airplanes and artillery. I hope the motherland will accelerate construction and manufacture more airplanes and artillery.

    We also asked the soldiers what they needed. Their answer was: "We need more victories!" When asked what their hopes were, their answer was: "I hope the motherland builds well, and I hope Chairman Mao is always healthy!"

    When asked what other hopes they had, a soldier approached my body and very quietly expressed his ideal, which is also the ideal of thousands of Volunteer Army members. This ideal is to be able to walk in front of Tiananmen Square after the victory and hear Chairman Mao say: "Comrades, you have worked hard!" Some soldiers, in order to wait for the realization of this ideal, saved the leather shoes that were issued to them, ready to wear them one day in front of Tiananmen Square and "ka, ka, ka".

    How lovely and how simple our heroic Volunteer Army soldiers are! Now, the letter they sent from the position to us to be forwarded to Chairman Mao is copied below as a concluding remark.

    "Respected Chairman Mao: Your warriors—we, will never fail the glorious title given by the motherland—the most beloved people. Following your instructions, according to the will of the people, we will completely eliminate the invaders, defend the rumbling machines, the tractors running in the fields, and the thousands of red scarves who are studying peacefully for the motherland. Every piece of land must be peaceful, and tall buildings must be built firmly. Respected Chairman Mao, heartfelt words are like flowing water that cannot be exhausted. Please accept this heart of gratitude and fighting heart that your soldiers dedicate to you."

专栏：

    我们从朝鲜回来
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团副总团长  陈沂亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    领受着你们所交给的光荣任务，我们今年又去了朝鲜。作为你们的代表来讲，我们作的事情很少。但是你们关怀前线的心，关怀你们自己的子弟的心，我们是尽我们的力量都给你们捎到了。前线的同志感谢你们，你们自己的子弟也感谢你们。他们一方面很兴奋（有的兴奋得下泪）的来接受我们带去的每一件慰问品，高呼“祖国——我的母亲”；一方面又感到祖国所委托给他们的任务没有完全完成，感到惭愧。其实这完全是他们的谦逊。一个班的战士把祖国送去的慰问品摆在阵地上，互相询问，好像进行检讨似的：“我能吃这个糖吗？”“我有资格抽这烟吗？”“我的任务完成了吗？”拿着刻有“赠给最可爱的人”字样的搪瓷杯，战士们纷纷宣誓：“祖国称我们为最可爱的人，我们一定要做祖国最可爱的事”。另一个班的一个战士把糖先吃了，当他看见人家还去拿糖进行检讨的时候，他马上拿着装糖的袋子向大家说：“你们说，要吃一块糖打一个敌人，我，已经把糖吃了，我决心留着装糖的袋子，永远带在身边，以后打死一个敌人，我拣一块小石头装进去，一直装到一百二十六块，和原来糖的数目一样，带回祖国，做传家之宝。”他是用这样的决心来和他的战友们一样，一起做祖国最可爱的事。
    这样的人，我们接触到的很多，他们异口同声的都说：“谢谢祖国、谢谢毛主席，派来了我们的亲人，我们两年没有见过我们的亲人了。”他们恨不得长一双翅膀飞去迎接他们的亲人。“亲人”，多真挚的称呼呀！为了接待我们这些“亲人”，连彭德怀司令员的小汽车都开到安东来了。英雄、功臣亲自驾驶汽车，有的还带上了救护车；为了使我们这些“亲人”得到比较安全与舒适的生活，很多部队都把自己最好的防空洞腾了出来。我们总团部一共去了三百多个人，他们就给我们腾出了三百多个人的住所。而他们的三百多个人，（实际上远远超过这个数字，因为他们都是挤着住的）就要住到别的地方去。而别的地方，自然首先在安全上，就不如原来的地方。
    然而这是对待“亲人”呀！他们就跟在火线上一样，没有什么顾虑。
    有的部队，听说我们这些“亲人”要去，好多天就在住地搜山，捉特务，怕万一隐藏一个特务，打信号，暴露目标，影响我们。有的部队专门修了礼堂来准备听我们的报告和看我们的演出。你想，我们要是报告不好，演出不好，怎样对得起他们呢？我去了一个离前线××里的地方，那是一个军部，礼堂名叫“前进”，三十公尺长，十二公尺宽，除了舞台和观众席外，有化装间，有音乐间，工兵连出工不到一百人，只修了四十天就完成了。修的时候，首长们和工兵们一起研究，先设计好，比准尺寸，到森林里面作，然后搬回来，凑在一起，就成功了礼堂。置身其间，简直就想不到这是前线。然而一切设备，都是按着应付战争环境在办的，敌机在天空看不见，敌炮有大山挡着，里面还开了五个太平门。万一有事，还可以从太平门出来，顺着交通沟
    （交通沟还筑有横墙）就可以走到安全地。而且不要忘记，我们还有高射炮。
    有的部队，甚至在坑道前沿的连队，因为曾经听到志愿军归国代表有被祖国人民从车站抬到旅馆的事，所以他们也抬着他们的“亲人”，从山下把他们抬到山上。
    至于吃，身受的人都会知道，他们真是像在宴嘉宾一样，什么都拿出来了。我们到过罗盛教的连队，战士们还专门为我们预备了一顿丰富的晚餐。我们有的同志连铺带盖一共四床被，加上前线同志们火热的心，你说还不够暖吗？
    而且，当我们去的时候，正是前线全线展开反击的时候，同志们都争相以“打胜仗，立大功”来迎接祖国派来的“亲人”，来回答祖国人民和毛主席的深情厚意，有一个部队还抓了俘虏亲自带到我们面前来作献礼。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：难道还有比这个更亲，更热，更高贵，更荣誉的吗？身受着这样亲、这样热、这样高贵、这样荣誉的待遇的我们，还有什么好说呢？“谢谢你们”，“谢谢你们”，“谢谢你们”，此外，我们再找不出更适当的话来说了。继之就是握手，拥抱，几千年来不习惯的礼节，不论男女，老少，在朝鲜前线都拥抱了。这是热情的拥抱，这是祖国人民和志愿军、我们最可爱的人心连心的拥抱。老头子，像张积慧的父亲张本周，董存瑞的父亲董全忠，在朝鲜四十多天，笑，从没有离开过他们的嘴角。慈祥的爸爸，代表着志愿军万千战士的爸爸，人人都以见到他们为幸福。有的部队没有见着，还专门打电报来要他们去。看啊，从他们身上，借用战士们的话：“可以看到祖国，可以看到自己的父母，可以看到毛主席。”勿怪有些从百里以外被派来迎接慰问团的战士，跟慰问团的代表握了手后，三天不洗，一定要回到连去，回到团去，回到师去，和没有见着慰问团的战士一一握手，才算完成任务，办了交代。
    多么热情呀！只有共产党毛主席教导出来的人才有这份热情，才够得上这份热情。
    想着，想着，越想下去，越觉得我们自己不论去前方或在祖国，我们的事确是作得太少了。如果我们对我们的工作还有什么没有作到、作好的地方，就深深觉得内愧。
    回想起去年五月四号，我们离开志愿军司令部的时候，那天天正下着大雾，志愿军司令部的首长们告诉我们：“好，今天这天气好，你们可以赶路，这是个好机会。”所谓好机会，就是可以不怕敌机袭扰，比较安全的通过封锁线。简短的话，可以概括当时行路的情况。而今年，我们曾到过驿谷川前线，在山顶遥望铁原，下山的时候，天已经是大明了，坐上汽车已经是七点半。那个地方只离敌人七里，敌机已经开始在天空出现了。但是除了师副政治委员要我们的汽车伪装一下，布置坐车的人监视敌机而外，小吉普就飞快的开着往回走。有没有人耽心敌炮开炮呢？有的人心里确实在挂念，但是送我们的战士说：“不要紧，这不是他的地区。”这话就是说这里敌炮封锁不住。你说，仗着战士，仗着他们的沉着，勇敢和聪明，我们还有什么可耽心的呢？顺着通往前沿战士自己修的宽坦的盘山公路，我们又平安的回到师部了。虽然，途中曾遇到两次敌机，一方面有大家监视着，老远就已发现；一方面司机灵巧，沿途都找了躲避之处，敌机好像就没有看见。
    计算起来，去年五月到今年十月，不过才十七个月，而变化竟如此之大，这只不过是从行路这一件小事说。但是亲爱的同志们，朋友们：在朝鲜、行路，就是一件大事。路行不好，关系我们战争很大。去年，我们祖国虽然财政经济情况还没有完全好转，但是全国人民节衣缩食，还是可以很好的援助我们志愿军的，问题是路行不好，交通战线上我们还没有打胜仗。我们第一次过鸭绿江桥，桥被炸了，眼看着我们行程受到阻碍，心里觉得很急，但更重要的还是眼看着许多物资、弹药送不过江去，这对在前线用血肉抵抗敌人的英雄们才是真正很急的事。今年不同了，这个桥有我们的空军在天上，有我们的高射炮在地下保护着它，它雄伟的屹立着，没有一点损伤。依靠它，把祖国和我们志愿军的血管紧紧的连结在一起了。
    是不是就是这一座桥呢？不是的。无数的桥都是这样，敌人从来没有放松过对这些交通孔道的破坏，问题是我们坚决的、巧妙的、不断的在反对敌人这些破坏。没有空军或空军不经常去的地方，依靠着地面的高射炮火，依靠着铁路运输上的精确计算，尤其是依靠着我们那些不怕寒冷，零下三十度也下水去抢修桥梁的铁道部队，他们以超人的毅力和聪明来预计到敌人可能破坏的地方，预先构图，预先构料，预先施工，预先作好桥墩、桥架，在预定的地方等候，一旦被破坏，就搬过去架上，这样就保证不会误什么时间。所以战士们、员工们都很有自信的说：“炸、你炸不着；炸着了，我们可以抢修。”　
    就是依靠这个决心、信心和巧妙的对敌斗争的办法，桥，始终是屹立着；车，始终是通着；物资、弹药就能够源源不断的运送到前线。敌人所吹嘘的对交通线的“绞杀战”，在这些英雄们面前是泄气了。这方面我们是打了很大的胜仗。
    防空哨的同志们，在打这个胜仗上起的作用也特别大。沿公路，同志们，你们听吧，看吧：“哨音”，“枪声”，“白旗”，“红旗”，指引着万千的司机“开灯、前进”！“闭灯、前进”！这就大大增强了汽车的运输率，大大减少了我们汽车的事故，今年九月份全路只被敌机击毁一辆汽车。战士们不满足，还提出“百日不出事故”的战斗口号。
    就是依靠这些运输战线上的英雄，今年志愿军的棉衣，三天（请注意，只是三天）就全部运完，没有一点损失。怪不得我们的战士已经早穿上了棉衣，而美军还在那里打哆嗦哩！也怪不得被俘的美军驾驶员问：“你们汽车上都装得有雷达吗？”我们的战士回答得好：“傻瓜，我们国家的工业还装不起，我们装的是人达。”我们就是依靠这个“人达”，就把美帝国主义的空军搞得不轻。防空哨的同志们已经很熟练了，他们全都分得出：敌机什么声音，什么飞机，想干什么动作；对我们自己的汽车，他们不看见也分得出：什么牌子，大、小、空车、满载，就凭这个在那里指挥和执行公路上的对空斗争。
    但是敌人永远发现不了他们，他们还主动打哩！有一次，在吴开里附近，他们打下一架敌机，一个美军中校驾驶员跳降落伞落下来了，被一个防空哨发现，战士马德融和一个战士急忙的赶上前去，跑了二十多里，马德融累得吐血，还是没有找着。但是已经到了我们战士手中的猎物，他们决不放弃，他们一面打枪，一面搜索，很久，很久，他们终于在一个大树前发现，而那位中校，早已经按着他们美军缴械投降的老规矩跪在地下等到解放了。正当这时，敌人来了十八架飞机，在他们周围转，又是扫射，又是投弹，一阵之后，直升飞机飞过来了，从直升飞机上露出梯子来，中校看到又惊又喜，扭转身就想走，两个战士把他拉着，他慌忙从身上掏美金、钢笔、连他爱人的照片一起都掏出来，递给我们的战士，想要我们的战士放他走，我们的战士那里会肯，还是死劲的把他拉着，并且把枪口对着他。直升飞机飞了一阵没影子，飞走了；大队的敌机又转近来，又是扫射，又是投弹，凶得很，看样子管不住这家伙了，两个战士没办法，低头一眼看到降落伞上的绳子，他们忽然聪明起来，用刺刀割下绳子，把那家伙捆在不远的一棵树上，动弹不得，他们俩则选了一个可以隐蔽的地方，一面隐蔽，一面用枪瞄着；直升飞机又来了，梯子照样放下来，但是许久、许久，看看还是没有影子，它好像放了一声“胡哨”，迅速地飞走了，大队敌机也跟着飞走了。那家伙——中校，丧气的，也是乖乖的跟着我们战士回来了。
    就凭着这些聪明和勇敢的战士，在他们聪明的指挥员指挥之下，美军在公路上的“空中优势”就逐渐的被打垮了。
    这个重要性是难以估量的。回想起去年“一把炒面一把雪”的时候，那时战士们托我们带回祖国的信是“一不想家，二不想老婆；只想吃个热馍馍”。“只要枪有吃，炮有吃，伤了能抬下来治疗，保证打败美国鬼子”。去年就是这个情况。今年则变成战士都表扬后勤工作了，这就说明敌人加诸我们的这个艰难困苦的情况，跟麦克阿瑟滚蛋一样，是一去不复返了。现在前方不是没有东西，而是东西没地方放；现在不是没运输力，而是运输力已有富裕。铁路、公路都有一套较成熟的经验可用了。
    正告美国的战争贩子们，让你们看看吧：就是在后方（这只是对前线部队而言）的中朝人民，你也是欺负不了的。让我们回过来再说说前线吧，亲爱的同志们，朋友们。
    给我们印象最深的是前线各级驻地都是那样的安祥，而这种安祥并不是充大胆或者麻痹，而是各方面都有了一套。我们随某军长到他们的军部，虽是夜晚到的，完全不像去年到他们那里的样子。去年问他们的一个驻地，连朝鲜人和中国人都在内，一共问了四个钟头，四个钟头时间，警报还拉了十几次。今年下车以后，也打几次防空枪，但秩序很好，枪一响，一切都沉静，战士们在黑夜里很熟练的就把东西搬上了山。我当夜就参观了他们的办公室，都有电灯，都安了地板，而且都存放了他们自己工兵作的各种桌椅板凳。第二天天明起来，我各处端详了一阵，眼睛看着这个指挥部的各个方面，耳朵听着过十数分钟又飞绕过来的敌机的声音，我看看作战室的参谋们，听听来回传电话的声音，还注视坐在办公室门口边谈问题、边晒太阳的几位军首长们，他们是多么的沉静而又有秩序呀！
    但是敌人不能发现他们，原因是他们是按着前线，按着战争，尤其是按着争取战争的胜利在建设他们的指挥部的。
    我们到过两个师部也是这样。我们到时他们已经升起他们在战场上用自己的手制造的火炉，自己的手烧的木炭在取暖了。令我们吃惊的还不是这些生活上的设备，而是师长的办公桌上摆满了书，其中有军事书，政治书，特别是有各种字典，师长在作战中是那样的忙迫和吃累，但他还在抽时间学文化。解放战争中，他曾经当过副团长，现在他已经是师长了。他们每天总是要抽点时间学习，他告诉我们：“近代战争，不学不行呀！”所以苏军“战斗条令”，
    “合同战术”这些书，他们都是在拚命的看，结合着他们的实战经验，看得就更快，懂得也更深。
    但是他们也很注意他们的身体，他们也很会玩，正如在一个战士墙报上看到的：“工作好，学习好，战斗好，吃好，玩好，身体好，这才能打胜仗。”当然，在战地要完全做到这些是有困难的。前线的同志们，就是在坑道的同志们，也都在朝着这个目标努力。师长就把敌机扔下的副油箱劈成两半，作成船，战斗和工作之余，找个有水的地方，划一划，玩一玩。
    这种情况，就是到连队也是如此。见到面，他们总是很高兴的。战斗之后，就是学习，修补自己的工事，有的帮助朝鲜人干活，有时把一付扑克切成两半做成两付大家玩。我就见过一个工兵紧张的把渡船撑离岸以后，他掏出口琴吹起来了。问到他们敌人情况时，他们总是说：“不要紧，我们这里离敌人还远哩！”其实敌我机枪在夜间交射的火球，就一个接连一个的掠过眼去。有时敌炮打得多了，落在山腰，落在旷野，战士们说：“这是你杜鲁门的仓库，你把炮弹都搬来吧！”有一个战士叫田济中的，专门为杜鲁门作了首快板诗，来嘲弄敌人的胡打炮。“美国兵，真洋相，每天炮弹瞎胡放；一门炮每天打多少，不知他算账不算账？老子蹲在工事里，学习、下棋、把歌唱，把山上草木刮个光，杜鲁门是个理发匠。”
    这种稀有的镇静，就能使我们每个指挥员、战斗员保持清醒的头脑，一切的创造都是从这个清醒里面得来的。
    去年还有人耽心朝鲜战争能不能打下去，如果战争要持久，怎样才能持久？今年这些问题都解决了，战士们说：“美帝国主义你要打多久，我们就陪你打多久。”去年有个美国新闻记者嘲笑我们说：
    “志愿军是背着五天的干粮来打仗，干粮完了，就回去了。”这是说我们交通线不健全，粮食、弹药运不上去。今天，美国新闻记者应该嘲笑他们自己了，我们志愿军的勇士都不愁粮食、弹药了，吃的百分之七十都是细粮。弹药，请听美帝国主义自己在上甘岭战斗后的发言吧。
    去年我们在汉江南岸打守备战的时候，修筑了野战工事，有时还是经不住敌人的飞机大炮，战士觉得还需要另想办法。五次战役以后，指挥员根据战士们的创造，发挥祖国人民勤劳勇敢的光荣传统，挖坑道工事。这种坑道工事，西起临津江，东至东海岸，纵横数百里，战士们称之为“地下长城”，战士雍建华曾有一首快板诗歌颂它：“坑道坚，坑道强，一切工事它为王，飞机大炮打不透，千军万马里边藏。”修工事用的木料，据统计，可以从朝鲜
    一直排到重庆。挖土开山，挖空了无数的山；有的部队为了修筑工事，费去几百万个工，但是战士们并没有什么近代化的工具，就是凭一双手。有的战
    士单打石眼每天就打四千锤，有的打了八千锤到一万锤，战士们就是用这种强度的劳动像同美帝国主义作战一样，来同自然作斗争，同顽石作斗争，他们说：“决心磨烂石头，困难见我发愁，决心比石还
    硬，情绪比山还高。”这样，战士们就有了家了，这个家就是我们大家都知道的“阵地之家”。依靠
    这个家，保存自己，防御敌人，反击敌人。
    世界上本来没有打不破的防线，可是志愿军修筑的防线，敌人就是打不破，因为这个防线不单是工事坚固，更主要的是有志愿军这样的人，毛泽东思想教育出来的人来守备。因为近代化的战争，不仅是打勇敢，打决心，打炮火，还要打战术，打聪明，打办法。志愿军是这六方面都具备的。这次上甘岭的战斗就说明了，有工事、有大炮，还要有人和人想出来的办法。
    美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮，他们不是兵不多，也不是炮火不厉害，而是他们的人不坚决，不勇敢，想不出比我们更好的办法，当然，战争的性质也决定了他们很难坚决和勇敢，所以他们也很难想出比我们更好的办法。请看在美军中流行的一首诗吧，这首诗的名字叫“献给朝鲜”。
    “在苏联和中国边境下面，便是朝鲜那块地方。那里便是我们注定要在那里服役的地方——上帝遗忘的地方。
    “用自动步枪和蚊子作战，用十字锹挖土，做着一些古老的奴隶的工作，是那么疲倦啊！
    “和蛇蝎在一起，在人变的沮丧万分的地方，在离你九千英里的某国土地上。
    “我们受寒、流汗、又颤栗，那是我们难以忍受的；可是我们仍不是罪犯，我们是我们上帝的保卫者呀！
    “我们是陆战队员，赚着微薄的薪水，保卫着百万富翁，每天只有一块六。
    “用和女友初会的回忆，来等待着，希望我们不在家的时候，她们没有嫁给别的儿郎。
    “没有人知道我们在活着，没有人丝毫关心，我们已被家里的人忘记，我们也是美国人。
    “在陆战队的时间，我们错过了最宝贵的光阴，孩子们别让征兵的抓着你，看上帝的面上别再从军。
    “当我们工作完了，走到那熟悉的地方，圣彼得会说：‘他们是朝鲜来的，他们已在地狱度过了他们的时光。’
    “流传的一句话：我们的本份不是去问‘为什么’，是去‘干’，是去‘死’！”
    这就是美军的情绪！加上我们的工事，借用战士的话，是“坐北向南”，即是住在坑道太阳见得少，总还可以见到；而敌人则是“坐南向北”，只有吃北风。战士说：“就这点，敌人也输了”。
    去年，因为我们坑道工事还未很好的建立起来，敌人依仗他的所谓飞机大炮掩护，相当猛烈，有时还去坦克面前跳舞，当上级号召开展冷枪冷炮运动，战士说：“这个办法好，打死十个去见师长，打死二十个去见军长，打死一百个去见毛主席。”就是这样，敌人一露头就打，什么地方露头，就在什么地方打；坐汽车看地形，打；解手，打；集合吃饭，也打。直打得敌人一天到晚不敢露头。因此，现在在美军中流行一句话叫“低下头来”，特别是当老兵看见新兵昂着头走路时，就在他脖颈上按一把：
    “低下头来”！我们战士觉得打这种仗很便宜，越打兴趣越大。在雨季，因为更靠近敌人，不好隐蔽，有一个战士脱得光光的，在雨地中，全身用稀黄泥涂上，爬在地上伏击敌人。
    以后，这个冷枪战更加开展了，步枪摸到敌人后面去打，大炮配合着步枪打。
    由于学习，由于实战，由于总结战士的创造，我们的指挥员也比以前变得更加聪明了，过去只会指挥步兵，或者只会带一个排、一个连冲锋；现在一个团长，除指挥步兵外，还要指挥坦克、大炮。而各种口径的大炮，单是汽车运送弹药这一项组织工作，在战斗环境就是复杂得了不得。我们今天的许多胜仗，都是和我们各个指挥员的聪明和进步分不开的。如果说过去他们只会简单地步炮协同，今天他们就能把很多的炮火——野炮山炮的炮火，坦克的炮火，迫击炮火，还有我们人民军队起家的炮火——炸药，组织得很好，运用自如。而当这些要决定的时候，总是先进行周密的调查研究和作好各种准备工作，最后连最下级的指挥员都认为有把握了，才动手。一个军长告诉我们说：“近代战争，我们经验不多，所以应该格外慎重。”他们这种对祖国、对人民、特别是对战士生命负责的精神深深感动着我们。战争把他们变得越加聪明了，他们越聪明，战士就更聪明，敌人也就显得越笨。战局就是这样越来越变得对我们有利。
    他们是不是有苦呢？有。战士说：“两年不见祖国就是最大的苦。”因此祖国的人常去看看他们很重要，给他们通通信，告诉他们你们所见到祖国每
    一件新鲜的事情，这对他们鼓舞和安慰都是很大。
    特别是在坑道中的战士们，潮湿、阳光不足，空气不好，每天面对山，面对树；有些部队在战斗时，没水喝，还喝过尿。应该说这是很艰苦的。战士们称“日光、空气、蔬菜”为“三宝”，我们看到的则是“日光、空气”、“蔬菜、烟叶”、“文工团”是他们在生活和战斗中不可缺少的三要素，我们祖国应该在这三方面首先给他们以满足。
    邓华同志曾代表志愿军全军向我们提出：希望我们祖国好好建设，现在战争是要白面大米加飞机、大炮，希望祖国加速建设，多多制造飞机大炮。
    我们也曾问过战士们有什么需要，他们的答复是：“需要更多的胜利！”问他们有什么希望，他们的答复是：“希望祖国建设好，希望毛主席永远健康！”
    再问他们还有什么希望时，一个战士靠近我的身子，很小声的表达了他的、也是万千志愿军心中的理想，这理想就是胜利后能够到天安门前走一走，听毛主席说一声：“同志们辛苦了！”有的战士为了等待这个理想的实现，曾经把发下的皮鞋保存起来，准备有一天穿着到天安门前“卡、卡、卡”。
    多么可爱而又是多么朴实的我们的英雄的志愿军战士啊！现在把他们从阵地上送出来要我们转呈给毛主席的信抄在下面，作为结束语。
    “敬爱的毛主席：你的战士——我们，永远不辜负祖国给的光荣称号——最可爱的人。循着你的指示，遵照人民的意志，彻底消灭侵略者，保卫隆隆转动的机器，田野上驰奔着的拖拉机，成千的红领巾为祖国而平安的学习，每一块土地要和平，万丈高楼牢牢的盖起。敬爱的毛主席，心里话像流水似的说不尽，请接受你的战士献给你的这颗感谢的心，战斗的心。”
