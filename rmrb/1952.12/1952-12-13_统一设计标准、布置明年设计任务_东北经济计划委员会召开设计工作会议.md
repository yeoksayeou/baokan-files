    [This newspaper report] (By this newspaper) The Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Commission, in order to strengthen leadership over the design work of various provinces and cities in the Northeast, unify design standards, and deploy next year's design tasks, convened a design work conference from November 26th to December 3rd. Managers and engineering and technical personnel from design companies in various provinces and cities of the Northeast attended the meeting.

    The meeting pointed out: In order to adapt to the larger-scale capital construction tasks of next year, it is necessary to greatly strengthen design work. The existing design forces are far from meeting the needs. This year, the provinces and cities in the Northeast can only complete 60% of the design tasks for general buildings. At the same time, the design leadership departments of various provinces and cities do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of design work, design technicians are not able to well accept advanced Soviet experience, and there is a lack of unified design standards, so the design work of various provinces and cities is still in disarray. For example, in 1952, twenty new secondary schools were built, with roughly the same teaching structure, but no two had the same design; the seven dormitories of the new universities had six different styles. The work of collecting data, drilling, and soil analysis has also just begun. Therefore, improving the level of design technology and improving design work has become an important current task.

    In order to unify design standards, the meeting collected and evaluated one hundred and fifty-seven drawings (including twelve types of buildings such as dormitories, warehouses, schools, and offices). The evaluation criteria were economy and practicality, diversified styling, and appropriately considering the appearance, future development needs, existing conditions, the differences between large cities and small towns, and unified component standards, prefabrication of construction, and other conditions. For example, three-story buildings are used for dormitories in large cities and large industrial and mining areas, while one- and two-story buildings are used in small towns; schools have three standards: urban middle schools, rural middle schools, and technical schools. After discussion by the participants, and absorbing the opinions of the Ministry of Education, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Health, and other user departments, the meeting finally selected a total of twenty-three drawings for dormitories and schools, which are to be used as standard designs for 1953. In this way, the design force for general buildings can be saved to undertake important and more complex engineering design tasks, so that the design force and tasks of various provinces and cities can basically reach a balance. At the same time, experiences were mutually observed and exchanged through the evaluation.

    After the meeting, the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Commission specifically assigned the design tasks for 1953 to various provinces and cities, and stipulated the deadlines for completing the design tasks. The work of modifying the selected standard design drawings must be completed in January next year; the design of important and complex projects such as state-owned local industry, university and college school buildings, and sanatoriums must be submitted by the end of March next year; the remaining engineering designs must also be submitted by the end of June next year. The meeting required all design departments to formulate work plans to ensure the completion of design tasks on schedule.

    Finally, the meeting emphasized that the design institutions of various provinces and cities should actively cultivate design forces, be good at dividing labor and cooperating with entrusted departments, and work together to complete construction tasks and save national investment. Design technicians should improve their ideological level, strive to learn advanced Soviet experience, and improve design quality.

    统一设计标准、布置明年设计任务
    东北经济计划委员会召开设计工作会议
    【本报讯】东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会为加强对各省、市设计工作的领导，统一设计标准，布置明年的设计任务，于十一月二十六日到十二月三日召开了设计工作会议。到会的有东北各省、市设计公司经理和工程技术人员。
    会议指出：为适应明年更大规模的基本建设任务，必须大大加强设计工作。现有的设计力量远不能满足需要，今年东北各省、市只能完成一般建筑物设计任务的百分之六十。同时各省、市的设计领导部门对设计工作的重要性认识不足，设计技术人员还不能很好地接受苏联先进经验，并且缺乏统一的设计标准，因而各省、市的设计工作还处于紊乱状态。如一九五二年新建二十个中等学校，教学编制大致相同，但没有一个相同的设计；新建高等学校的七幢宿舍有六种样式。搜集资料、钻探、土壤分析等工作也刚开始进行。因此，提高设计技术水平，改进设计工作，便成为当前的重要任务。
    为了统一设计标准，会议搜集了一百五十七份图纸（包括宿舍、仓库、学校、办公室等十二种类型的建筑物），进行了评选。评选标准是经济实用，造型多样化，并适当地照顾外观、将来发展的需要和现有的条件，以及大城市与小城镇的差异和统一构件标准、施工工厂化等条件。如大城市和大工矿区的宿舍采用三层建筑，小城镇采用一、二层建筑；学校则订有城市中学、乡村中学和技术学校三种标准。经过与会人员的讨论，并吸收了教育部、东北总工会和卫生部等使用部门的意见，会议最后选出宿舍、学校共二十三份图纸，准备作为一九五三年的标准设计。这样就可以节省出一般建筑物的设计力量，来承担重要的较繁杂的工程设计任务，使各省、市的设计力量与任务基本上达到平衡。同时，通过评选也互相观摩和交流了经验。
    会后，东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会具体分配了各省、市一九五三年的设计任务，并对各项设计任务完成的期限作了规定。修改已选出的标准设计图纸的工作，要在明年一月份全部完成；国营地方工业、大学与专科学校的校舍、疗养院等重要的、繁杂的工程设计，要在明年三月底以前交出；其余的工程设计也要在明年六月份以前提出。会议要求各设计部门订出工作计划，保证按期完成设计任务。
    最后，会议强调指出：各省、市设计机构要积极培养设计力量，善于与委托部门分工合作，共同为完成建设任务和节约国家投资而努力。设计技术人员要提高思想水平，努力学习苏联先进经验，提高设计质量。
