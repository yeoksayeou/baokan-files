Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam Dispatch from Vietnam News Agency, 7th: The Vietnamese People's Army has achieved great victories on various fronts in North Vietnam. Since mid-October, the People's Army has eliminated more than 10,000 French invading troops.

In Northwest Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated 65 strongholds of the French invading army in October and November, annihilating nearly 5,000 French troops. When Son La City was recovered on November 22, the People's Army seized 11 mortars, 24 light and heavy machine guns, 22 submachine guns, 330 rifles, 35.5 tons of ammunition, 55 tons of rice and paddy, and a large number of other grains and military supplies.

The People's Army is currently besieging Na San, the last stronghold of the French army in Son La. On the night of November 30, in a probing attack, the People's Army destroyed Phu Hong, the highest stronghold northeast of Na San, and another stronghold southwest of Na San, wiping out about two companies of French troops and capturing Misda, the commander of the 4th Company of the 2nd Moroccan Battalion. On December 1, the People's Army destroyed some other outposts of the French army. On the night of December 2, the People's Army shelled the Na San airport, damaging several French aircraft.

In Phu Tho Province, the People's Army eliminated a total of 1,844 French invading troops in November. On November 25, the People's Army had completely cleared all the French invading troops who had intruded into the liberated areas of the province.

The Vietnamese People's Army has strengthened guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta, eliminating a large number of French troops. In the nearly one-month period ending November 23, the People's Army annihilated 5,464 French troops in more than 200 battles fought on both banks of the Red River and in the middle reaches (excluding Phu Tho). A total of 117 French strongholds were eliminated or forced to withdraw. In these battles, the People's Army also seized 19 artillery pieces, 155 light and heavy machine guns, 329 submachine guns, 1,574 rifles, and a large number of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Reuters reported on the heavy casualties suffered by the French invading troops besieged in Na San, Son La Province, Vietnam, saying: At dawn on December 2, the entire French stronghold, about one mile wide, which had been attacked by the Vietnamese People's Army, was littered with dead and wounded. When the Vietnamese People's Army attacked, their mortar shells accurately landed in the French positions, and many defenders were killed in the trenches before they had a chance to fire a single shot.
