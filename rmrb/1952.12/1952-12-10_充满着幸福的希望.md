To the Editor: I am a poor peasant from Donggu Village, Fifth District, Fugou County, Henan Province, with a family of six. During the land reform, I was allocated more than 30 mu of land, raised a large ox, a horse, a pony, and a donkey. The grain I harvested each year was enough to eat and have some left over. The children love to dress nicely, so in the first half of this year, I bought them more than 50 chi (a Chinese unit of length) of plain and floral cloth, as well as gabardine. I thought, "Anyway, there's grain in the bin, so if the children and daughters-in-law want something, just let them buy it." My wife felt it was too hot to cook at home in the summer, so I bought her coal to burn. Cooking with coal is clean and not smoky, and she always has a smile on her face. You see, cooking with a coal fire means steamed white wheat buns, soup, and vegetables. She has been with me all her life and is finally living such a good life—something she never dreamed of before!

Last year, we were quite content with such a life. Everyone said, "Living like this for the rest of our lives is enough to enjoy." Later, we realized we were wrong. It turns out that the life Chairman Mao wants us to live is thousands and thousands of times better than this!

Last year, the Fifth Cultivation Team of the state-owned Yellow River Flood Area Farm demarcated more than 10,000 mu of land near our village. At first, we were really worried: how could those few people plant wheat? But the machines roared, and in a few days, the land was plowed, harrowed, and the wheat was planted. The land was tilled as flat and loose as a flour vat. When it was time to harvest the wheat, an even bigger machine harvested and threshed the wheat in the fields in just a few days. This left us dumbfounded. Only then did we remember what the cadres often told us: "Go social, go social" (move towards a socialist society). It turns out that Chairman Mao wants to lead us to separate from the oxen and horses, sit on machines, and cultivate thousands and tens of thousands of mu of land easily and happily, living a happy life that everyone can't even imagine. Now we must expand and improve our mutual aid teams and strive to transition to agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms as soon as possible, using machine production.

    充满着幸福的希望
    编辑同志：我是河南扶沟县五区东古村的一个贫农，全家六口人。土地改革中分得三十多亩地，喂养了一头大牛、一匹马，还有一匹小马和一头小驴。一年收得的粮食，除掉吃用，还有剩余。孩子们爱漂亮，今年上半年就给他们买了五十多尺市布、花布，还有华达呢。我想：“反正囤里有粮食，孩子、媳妇想要，就让他们买去。”我的老伴夏天在家做饭嫌热，我就买煤给她烧。做饭时，又干净又不燎的慌，她脸上总是挂着笑。本来吗，升着煤火，做的是一块面的白馍，有汤、有菜。她跟着我一辈子才过上这样的好日子——从前作梦都想不到的呢！
    这样的日子，在去年，我们真有些满足了。大家都这样说：“就这样过一辈子，够享福的了。”后来我们才知道自己想错了。原来毛主席要我们过的日子，比这还要好上千万倍呢！
    去年国营黄泛区农场第五耕作队在我们村附近划出一万多亩地。开始我们真有些发愁：那几个人，怎样种上麦子呢？可是机器轰轰轰，不几天地耕好了、耙好了、麦也种上了。地整得像面缸样又平又松。收麦时，一个更大的机器，不几天就把地里的麦子割了、打了。这些使得我们目瞪口呆了。这才想起来干部常给我们说的：“走社会、走社会”
    （走向社会主义社会）。原来毛主席就是要领导我们和牛马分家，坐在机器上，轻松愉快地耕种着几千几万亩土地，过着大家想也想不出的幸福日子。现在我们就要扩大和提高我们的互助组，争取早日过渡到农业生产合作社、集体农庄、使用机器生产。　郁文升
