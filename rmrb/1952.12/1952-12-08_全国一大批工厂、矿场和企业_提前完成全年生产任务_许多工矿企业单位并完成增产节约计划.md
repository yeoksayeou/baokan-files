    A Large Number of Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country Have Completed Their Annual Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule; Many Industrial and Mining Enterprises Have Also Completed Plans for Increased Production and Economy
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the end of August, a large number of factories, mines, and enterprise units across the country have completed their annual production tasks or increased production and economy plans ahead of schedule. Many units have completed both their production tasks and their increased production and economy plans. Among them, Beijing's factories and mining enterprises completed the 1952 annual plan to increase production and save 800 billion yuan one month ahead of schedule. This large group of factories and mining enterprises includes the Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, Tangshan Electric Power Bureau Power Plant, Yangquan Iron Plant, Shanghai Railway Bureau, Benxi Steel Plant, Taiyuan Machine Factory, Taiyuan Cement Plant, Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4, Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory, Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory, Liaodong Yantai Coal Mine, and other famous factories and mines.
    The early completion of production tasks and increased production and economy plans by various factories and mining enterprises marks a further upsurge in the patriotic labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, technicians, and enterprise management cadres in our country. This year, the production tasks of various factories and mining enterprises have generally increased significantly compared to the past. In addition, some units were busy with the "Three-Anti" movement in the first half of the year, which had some impact on production. Therefore, there were considerable difficulties in completing the plans. However, with the efforts of the workers, the difficulties were overcome, and the production tasks and increased production and economy plans were completed ahead of schedule. Especially during the high tides of several production competitions in welcoming "May Day," "July 1st," National Day, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," many units created new production records, and production greatly improved. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's pig iron production task this year increased by 17.1% compared to last year, equivalent to 421.74% of the plant's highest annual output before liberation, and this production task was completed by the end of October.
    Summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in production, especially learning and promoting advanced Soviet experiences, is an important reason why various factories and mining enterprises have completed their production plans ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics from 21 factories and mining enterprises in Beijing, a total of 58 key advanced production experiences were summarized and promoted this year. The promotion of these experiences provided a reliable guarantee for completing the tasks of increasing production and saving ahead of schedule. For example, the Shijingshan Power Plant completed its annual plan for increasing production and saving two months ahead of schedule due to the promotion of advanced Soviet experiences such as burning low-value coal, rapid overhaul, and scientific round-the-clock inspection, which had a decisive impact. The promotion of using low-value coal for power generation alone saved the Shijingshan Power Plant over 3.2857 billion yuan in wealth for the state in the third quarter, and the plant's fuel cost this year was 75% lower than in 1949. For example, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory overcame the long-standing problem of tightness at the beginning and end or tightness in some areas and looseness in others by implementing the advanced Soviet experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," allowing the annual national production task to be completed two months and one day ahead of schedule. For example, after promoting advanced operating methods such as "blocking the tapping hole without stopping the blast," "calcining ore from raw to cooked," and continuously increasing the air volume, the Yangquan Iron Plant continuously created two new national records for small blast furnace iron smelting, reducing the blast furnace volume utilization coefficient to 0.96 cubic meters per ton. The Taiyuan Machine Factory promoted the Soviet high-speed cutting method on 88.9% of its lathes, increasing machine tool efficiency by one to twenty times.
    Planned and organized leadership of production, vigorous mobilization of the masses of workers, and improvement of production management methods are important guarantees for various factories and mining enterprises to complete their annual production tasks and increase production and economy plans ahead of schedule. Beijing was able to complete the national production task that increased by 32% compared to 1951 and complete its annual plan for increasing production and saving ahead of schedule, mainly due to the attention and leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. As early as during the "Three-Anti" movement, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly instructed various units to resolutely implement the policy of "fighting tigers and production without error." Since the North China Region Industrial Production Competition Conference in June, Beijing has fully launched the patriotic campaign to increase production and save. In order to unify the leadership of this movement, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Factory Branch Section, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and other agencies jointly formed the "Beijing Municipal Patriotic Production Increase and Savings Competition Committee" and established an office to handle daily work. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also frequently used collective reporting and key inspections to promote and lead this movement forward. In order to implement the production and increase production and savings plans into the actual actions of the masses of workers, various factories and mining enterprises across the country first widely mobilized the masses of workers to conduct discussions when formulating production and increase production and savings plans. For example, the increased production and savings plan of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory was originally set at 22 billion yuan by the leading cadres; later, after repeated discussions by the workers' representative meeting, workshop cadres, and the masses of workers, the plan gradually increased from 22 billion yuan to 25 billion yuan, 28 billion yuan, and finally 36.3 billion yuan. After the "Three-Anti" movement and the democratic general inspection, various factories and mining enterprises generally implemented production reforms. For example, 61 industrial, mining, and enterprise units in Beijing conducted technical inspections in mid-September. This enabled leading cadres to deeply understand the production situation, find key problems in production, and lay the foundation for implementing planned management in the future. The work of production reform enabled the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to be further developed. Many workers put forward extremely valuable rationalization proposals or "tricks" for improving production and other aspects. After the 1,580 tricks proposed by the workers of the Qiqihar Railway Factory were adopted and implemented, the factory's production efficiency increased to over 112%. Various factories paid attention to the cooperation between production departments and management departments in the increased production and savings movement, which also played a certain role in completing the production plan. The Shijingshan Power Plant equipped each workshop with cost members, statisticians, material clerks, and clerks, and established a joint office system for cost members headed by the accounting department and planning department. After that, a daily statistical system was established from the group to the workshop and even the entire factory, effectively directing the production of various departments.
    Now, after completing their plans, the workers of various factories and mining enterprises have successively put forward new plans, determined to create more wealth for the country before the end of the year. Factories and mining enterprises in Beijing, as well as Tianjin Wire Factory, Shenyang Clothing Factory No. 2, Northeast Chemical Hygiene Materials Factory, Liaodong Paper Mill, Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4, Qiqihar Railway Factory, Zhangjiakou Vegetable Oil Factory, Benxi Second Power Plant, and others have all put forward new goals of effort. The workers of factories, mines, and enterprises in Beijing decided to strive to increase production and save 100 billion yuan in wealth for the country before the end of this year; Tianjin Wire Factory decided to increase production and save 27 billion yuan before the end of the year; After completing the annual production plan, the workers of Taiyuan Machine Factory proposed to increase the wealth of the country by 10 billion yuan; Qiqihar Railway Factory also put forward a plan to increase production and save more than 78,000 tons of grain.

    全国一大批工厂、矿场和企业
    提前完成全年生产任务
    许多工矿企业单位并完成增产节约计划
    【本报讯】全国一大批工厂、矿场和企业单位，八月底以来，已提前完成了全年生产任务或增产节约计划。有许多单位既完成了生产任务又完成了增产节约计划。其中北京市各厂矿企业一九五二年全年增产节约八千亿元的计划，提前一个月完成。这一大批厂矿企业包括石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、华北农业机械总厂、唐山电业局发电厂、阳泉铁厂、上海铁路局、本溪钢厂、太原机器厂、太原水泥厂、沈阳橡胶四厂、秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂、张家口矿山机械厂、辽东烟台煤矿等著名厂矿。
    各厂矿企业提前完成生产任务和增产节约计划，标志着我国广大工人群众、技术人员与企业管理干部的爱国主义劳动热情进一步高涨。今年，各厂矿企业生产任务一般都比过去增加很多，加以上半年某些单位因忙于“三反”运动，曾使生产受到了一些影响，因此，在完成计划方面是有不少困难的。但在职工们的努力下，克服了困难，提前完成了生产任务和增产节约计划。特别在迎接“五一”、“七一”、国庆节、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议以及“中苏友好月”的几个生产竞赛的高潮中，许多单位都创造了生产新纪录，生产大大提高了一步。例如石景山钢铁厂，今年生铁生产任务比去年增加了百分之十七点一，相当于解放前该厂最高年产量的百分之四百二十一点七四，并且在十月底就完成了这项生产任务。
    总结和推广生产上的先进经验，特别是学习和推广苏联的先进经验，是各厂矿企业提前完成生产计划的重要原因。据北京市二十一个厂矿企业不完全统计，今年共总结和推广了五十八种关键性的先进生产经验。这些经验的推广，给提前完成增产节约任务，提供了可靠的保证。例如石景山发电厂，由于推广了苏联烧低值煤、快速检修和科学巡回检查等有决定意义的先进经验，就提前两个月完成了全年增产节约计划。其中推广利用低值煤发电一项，即使石景山发电厂在第三季度内为国家节约了三十二亿八千五百七十余万元的财富，今年全厂燃料成本也比一九四九年降低了百分之七十五。又如华北农业机械总厂由于推行了苏联“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验，克服了长期没有解决的前松后紧或此松彼紧的现象，使全年国家生产任务得以提前两个月零一天完成。如阳泉铁厂在推广了“堵出铁口不停风”、“焙烧矿石生料变熟料”及不断加大风量等先进操作法后，连续创造了两次全国小型高炉炼铁的新纪录，高炉容积利用系数降低到零点九六立方公尺吨。太原机器厂在百分之八十八点九的车床上推行了苏联的高速切削法，使机床效率提高了一至二十倍。
    有计划有组织地领导生产、大力发动工人群众和改进生产管理方法，是各厂矿企业提前完成全年生产任务和增产节约计划的重要保证。北京市能完成比一九五一年增产百分之三十二的国家生产任务和提前完成了全年增产节约计划，主要由于北京市人民政府、中共北京市委员会的重视和领导。远在“三反”运动期间，中共北京市委员会就明确地指示各单位，坚决贯彻“打虎生产两不误”的方针。自从六月华北区工业生产竞赛会议后，北京市就全面展开了爱国增产节约运动。为了统一这个运动的领导，北京市人民政府财政经济委员会、北京市人民政府劳动局、中共北京市委员会工厂支部科、北京市总工会、中国新民主主义青年团北京市委员会等机关联合组成“北京市爱国增产节约竞赛委员会”，并设立办公室，处理日常工作。中共北京市委员会还经常运用集体汇报和重点检查的方式，来推动和领导这一运动前进。为了使生产和增产节约计划贯彻到职工群众的实际行动中去，全国各厂矿企业在制订生产和增产节约计划时，首先广泛发动职工群众进行讨论。例如华北农业机械总厂的增产节约计划，领导干部原来定为二百二十亿元；后来，经过职工代表会、车间干部和工人群众的反复讨论，这个计划便由二百二十亿元逐步增加到二百五十亿、二百八十亿到最后的三百六十三亿元。各厂矿企业在经过“三反”运动和民主大检查之后，普遍实行了生产改革。例如北京全市六十一个工、矿、企业单位，九月中旬进行了技术查定。这就使得领导干部深入地了解了生产情况，找到了生产中的关键性的问题，打下了今后实行计划管理的基础。生产改革工作使广大职工的生产积极性能够进一步地发挥。许多职工提出了对提高生产等方面极为宝贵的合理化建议或“窍门”。齐齐哈尔铁路工厂职工们所提出的一千五百八十个窍门被采纳和被实现后，该厂生产效率提高到百分之一百一十二以上。各个工厂在增产节约运动中注意生产部门与管理部门的配合，对于完成生产计划也起了一定作用。石景山发电厂在各车间配备了成本员、统计员、材料员和事务员，建立了以会计科、计划科为首的成本员联合办公制度后，从小组到车间以至全厂都建立与健全了日统计制度，有效地指挥了各个部门的生产。
    现在，各厂矿企业的职工在完成计划之后，已纷纷提出新的计划，决定在年前再为国家创造更多的财富。北京各厂矿企业，以及天津电线厂、沈阳被服二厂、东北化学卫生材料厂、辽东造纸厂、沈阳橡胶四厂、齐齐哈尔铁路工厂、张家口植物油厂、本溪第二电厂等都提出了新的努力目标。北京市各工厂、矿场和企业的职工决定争取在今年年底以前再为国家增产节约一千亿元的财富；天津电线厂决定年底前再增产节约二百七十亿元；太原机器厂完成全年生产计划后，职工们提出再为国家增产一百亿元的财富；齐齐哈尔铁路工厂也提出了再增产节约七万八千多吨粮食的计划。
