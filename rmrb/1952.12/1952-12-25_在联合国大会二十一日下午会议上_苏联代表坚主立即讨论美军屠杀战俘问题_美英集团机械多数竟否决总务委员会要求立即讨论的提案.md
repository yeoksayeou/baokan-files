According to TASS: The United Nations General Assembly continued its session on the afternoon of the 21st. Due to the firm demands of the Soviet representative, the Assembly has been forced to agree to discuss the Soviet proposal regarding the "Collective Slaughter of Korean and Chinese Prisoners of War on Pongam Island by the American Military Authorities" before the Assembly adjourns. This issue was included on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly at the request of the Soviet Union during the General Committee meeting on the 21st, and the General Committee requested the Assembly to discuss it immediately before the adjournment. However, at the meeting on the 21st, the President of the Assembly, Canadian representative Pearson, attempted to avoid discussion by claiming "technical" difficulties and a lack of time to prepare a report.

Regarding this issue, members of the press pointed out that the Soviet delegation's raising of the collective slaughter of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by American armed forces was something that the United States and its accomplices in the Korean War had not anticipated. The speech by American representative Gross clearly illustrated this situation; he firmly insisted that this issue should only be discussed after all thirteen other items on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly had been discussed. Gross could not offer any arguments to defend his cowardly stance, nor could he defend the atrocities committed by American troops against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The Deputy Head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, pointed out that the American representative's request was unreasonable. He said that the issue raised by the Soviet delegation was far more important than the various issues that the Assembly was about to discuss; he emphasized that the General Committee had already recommended that this issue be reviewed immediately. Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation believed it was necessary to immediately discuss the General Committee's report at the beginning of the plenary session, and the General Committee's report could be prepared in ten to fifteen minutes.

Eight delegations voted in favor of the Soviet delegation's proposal (Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Syria), ten delegations abstained, most of which were Arab and Asian countries. Thirty-seven delegations, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted against the Soviet proposal.

Although the American-British bloc's mechanical majority rejected the General Committee's proposal to immediately discuss this issue, due to the Soviet delegation's firm stance demanding that this issue must be discussed immediately, Pearson had to say that this issue would definitely be raised for discussion before the adjournment of the Seventh General Assembly.

### 在联合国大会二十一日下午会议上  苏联代表坚主立即讨论美军屠杀战俘问题  美英集团机械多数竟否决总务委员会要求立即讨论的提案

    在联合国大会二十一日下午会议上
    苏联代表坚主立即讨论美军屠杀战俘问题
    美英集团机械多数竟否决总务委员会要求立即讨论的提案
    据塔斯社讯：联合国大会在二十一日下午继续举行会议。由于苏联代表的坚决要求，大会已被迫同意在大会休会前讨论苏联提出的“美国军事当局集体屠杀蜂岩岛上的朝鲜和中国战俘”问题。这个问题是总务委员会二十一日会议上应苏联的要求通过列入联合国本届大会议程并要大会立即在休会以前讨论的。但是，在二十一日的会议上，大会主席、加拿大代表皮尔逊却藉口“技术”困难，来不及准备报告企图借此避免讨论。
    关于这个问题，新闻界人士指出：苏联代表团提出关于美国武装部队在蜂岩岛集体屠杀朝中战俘问题一事是美国及其在朝鲜进行侵略的帮凶国家所未能预料到的事情。美国代表葛罗斯的发言便清楚地说明了这种情况，他坚决主张，必须等到联合国本届大会议程上的十三项其他议程全讨论了再来讨论这个问题。葛罗斯不能提出任何论据来为他的怯懦立场辩护，也不能对美军加于朝中战俘的暴行辩解。
    苏联代表团副团长葛罗米柯指出美国代表的要求是毫无理由的。他说，苏联代表团提出的问题比大会所将讨论的各项问题重要得多；他并强调说，总务委员会已经建议马上审议这个问题。葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团认为必须在全体会议开始时立即讨论总务委员会的报告，而总务委员会的报告在十分钟至十五分钟时间内就可以准备好。
    八国代表投票赞成苏联代表团的提案（苏联、波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、埃及、印度尼西亚和叙利亚），十个代表团弃权，其中大多数是阿拉伯与亚洲国家。美、英、法等三十七个代表团投票反对苏联提案。
    美英集团机械多数虽然否决了总务委员会要求立即讨论这个问题的提案，但是，由于苏联代表团要求把这个问题必须立即予以讨论的坚决立场，皮尔逊不得不说这个问题一定会在第七届大会休会前提出讨论。
