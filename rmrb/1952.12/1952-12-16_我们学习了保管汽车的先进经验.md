    To the Editor: The Lanzhou General Station of the Northwest Petroleum Administration and Marketing Company has studied advanced Soviet experience, and now does not drain the water from vehicles parked at night in winter, and does not use fire to heat vehicles before starting them, shortening working hours and prolonging the life of parts.
    The climate in the Northwest region is cold. In the past, when a car stopped, the water had to be drained from the car's water tank, otherwise the water tank or cylinder would freeze and crack. According to advanced Soviet experience, adding one and a half or two gallons of antifreeze to the water tank can prevent the water tank from freezing. Furthermore, in the past, it was necessary to heat the oil pan with fire before starting the vehicle, which was a waste of time and prone to danger. At the same time, the life of the engine would be shortened if it was heated with fire too many times. Now, according to advanced Soviet experience, adding domestic No. 40 engine oil and 15% kerosene to the vehicle engine during winter driving eliminates the need to heat the oil pan with fire every morning when starting the car. If the climate is colder than it is now, No. 30 engine oil with 15% kerosene can be used. This prolongs the life of the parts. Song Binglin

    我们学习了保管汽车的先进经验
    编辑同志：西北石油管理局运销公司兰州总站，学习苏联先进经验，冬季车辆晚间停驰不放水，车辆发动前不用烤火，缩短了工作时间，延长了机件寿命。
    西北地区气候较冷，过去汽车一停驰，就要把水从汽车的水箱里放出来，不然就会冻裂水箱或汽缸。该站根据苏联先进经验，把水箱里加入一加仑半或两加仑的防冻剂，就能防止水箱冻结了。再就是车辆开动前，过去必需用火烤油底，很浪费时间，又容易发生危险，同时引擎用火烤得次数太多，寿命也会缩短。现在，该站根据苏联先进经验，冬季行车时在车辆引擎里加上国产四十号机油和百分之十五的煤油，每天早上发动车时，就不必用火来烤油底了。如果气候比现在冷时，用三十号机油加百分之十五的煤油就可以了。因而延长了机件的寿命。    宋炳林
