We Cherish the Memory of Soviet Comrades
Miao Di, Zhao Zhifang

    Twenty-two. On the day of the farewell party, the club was filled with a sense of parting. I hugged Comrade Darasov tightly. The workers were all telling Comrade Darasov that they hoped he could come back again.

    Twenty-three. On the day before his departure, Comrade Darasov still couldn't bear to stop caring for us. He repeatedly introduced us to the advanced Soviet production experiences and factory management experiences, hoping that we could make greater contributions to the motherland's production and construction.

    Twenty-four. Now I have learned to master the production planning work of more than twenty branch factories. When one new locomotive after another rolls out of the factory, I think of Comrade Darasov, and immediately a force pushes me forward. I want to accelerate the learning of the advanced Soviet experience in managing factories, and write a letter to our close friend, Comrade Darasov, to tell him the good news of our work's success.

    我们怀念着苏联同志
    苗地  赵志方作
    二十二、开欢送会的那天，俱乐部里充满了送别的情绪。我和达拉索夫同志紧紧地拥抱着，工友们都在和达拉索夫同志说，希望他能再回来。
    二十三、临别的前一天，达拉索夫同志还舍不了对我们的关心。他再三把苏联先进的生产经验和工厂管理的经验介绍给我们，希望我们在祖国的生产建设上能有更大的贡献。
    二十四、现在我已经学会掌握二十几个分厂的生产计划工作。当一辆一辆的新机车开出厂房时，我就想起了达拉索夫同志，马上就有一股力量在推动着我。我要加速地学好苏联管理工厂的先进经验，把工作上胜利的消息，写信告诉我们亲密的朋友——达拉索夫同志。
