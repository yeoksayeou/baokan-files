    Launch Mass Mineral Reporting Work
    Northeast Geological Survey Institute Team 104 Zhao Shizhang
    Our motherland is about to embark on large-scale economic construction. We need to build factories, railways, water conservancy projects..., requiring a large amount of steel and metals like copper, lead, and antimony. Our motherland is rich in endless resources, and we must find them, utilize them, and build a people's industry. Who should we rely on to find them? There are too few experts and not enough technicians. We must rely on the broad masses of people to pay attention to mineral resources, discover clues, and report them to the government. Then, the government can send people to investigate and use manpower in a focused manner to solve the problem. Our country has vast lands and a large population. People live in deep mountains and remote wildernesses. Some have lived in one place for generations. They are familiar with every mountain, every river gully, and even every handful of sand and every stone cannot escape their eyes. When we were investigating in the Greater Khingan Mountains, an old worker could close his eyes and describe the terrain, mountain shapes, and the color and appearance of the stones in the surrounding dozens of miles in detail. He was a great help to our investigation. If the entire nation is mobilized, minerals in any location can be discovered quickly.
    Currently, there are many favorable conditions for mobilizing the masses to report mineral deposits:
    First, the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the correct implementation of the Northeast People's Government's "Provisional Measures for Rewarding Mass Mineral Reporting" inspire the people's patriotic enthusiasm and the initiative to report mineral deposits.
    Second, the education that the broad masses have received in their actual lives during the economic construction of the past few years has filled them with confidence and hope for the future of the country and a high degree of enthusiasm for national construction. Once mobilized, the broad masses will respond. Moreover, discovering and mining mineral deposits is beneficial to the country, the locality, and the individual. The interests of the country are entirely consistent with the interests of the locality, and current interests are consistent with long-term interests. For example, since a certain village in Panshi started mining a new mine, in just over half a year, many farmers have increased their income from sideline businesses, and they have successively added livestock, vehicles, and built houses.
    Third, mass mineral reporting work can be closely integrated with production. Whether farming, working, or collecting firewood, medicinal herbs, mushrooms, ginseng, herding livestock, picking tree seeds, collecting hazelnuts, or even walking, as long as you pay attention at any time, you may discover minerals. It is not necessary to deliberately search everywhere.
    Fourth, rural primary school teachers and mass teachers are the basic forces for carrying out propaganda and mobilizing the masses to report mineral deposits. They have prestige among the masses, and they are very enthusiastic about the country's construction. In many places, primary school teachers and mass teachers have compiled mineral reporting propaganda materials into quick-clapper rhymes, shadow plays, and dramas to promote them everywhere. Some teachers have also requested to organize mass mineral reporting committees or organize students to travel to the mountains during vacations to collect stones as specimens. The enthusiastic propaganda and organization of these patriotic people's teachers is a powerful guarantee for the widespread development of mass mineral reporting work.
    Mobilizing the masses to report mineral deposits is a new thing. Our experience is still very limited. The masses do not yet understand this matter very well, and they have many concerns. We must publicize and explain to the masses to dispel ideological concerns. Some villagers say, "Reporting mineral deposits is a good thing, but we don't know what they look like. How can we find them?" The fact that five children in Panshi reported mineral deposits provides a good answer to this question. Mineral ore is clearly different from ordinary stones. As long as we pay attention, we can find it. Some people say, "Those children are lucky to have found minerals." This is a superstitious saying and has no basis. Minerals exist on mountains and underground. They don't walk or move. Whoever looks for them will be discovered. There is also a superstitious idea that mining will "harm the earth's energy," which is even more unreasonable. Taking the minerals underground to develop the economy can enhance the country's strength and also increase the people's income. This is real. As for "earth's energy," there is no such thing at all. As for someone saying that mining will "tear down houses," this is also an unnecessary concern. The People's Government works for the people's interests everywhere and will never harm the interests of the masses because of mining. On the contrary, many new houses have been built since a new mine was opened in Panshi. "What if I report the wrong thing?" There is no need to worry about this either. The government will judge based on the ore you report. If it is not a mineral, they will explain it to you, and the reporter bears no responsibility. However, it is not permissible to make false reports or deceive people, such as taking stones from a mine and falsely claiming they are from another mountain. That is not good.
    Some people have an understanding of mineral reporting and want to report it, but they don't know where to report it. Where should you report it? Report it to the government. It is best to report from the grassroots government (district, village) and transfer it up level by level, so that it is easy to grasp the situation. In the past, some cadres neglected mass mineral reporting work and treated it with a bureaucratic attitude. When the villagers sent ore, they either ignored it or dealt with it perfunctorily, throwing the ore away and considering the matter finished. This kind of bureaucracy has caused incalculable losses to national wealth. This is very harmful to national construction and must be thoroughly corrected. This is one aspect. On the other hand, reporters should also not be "impatient." Some villagers believe that once a report is made, it should be investigated, and once investigated, it should be mined, the faster the better. This wish is good, and the national agencies that investigate underground resources should also try to do it quickly. However, work has priorities, and mining is not such a simple matter. It must go through detailed exploration and drilling, etc. Being careless and hasty will cause great waste to the country.
    In order to better carry out mass mineral reporting work, all localities should strengthen organizational leadership in the future, launch large-scale publicity work, collect mineral information, and launch investigations, so as to discover the country's underground resources faster and better and welcome our upcoming large-scale economic construction!

    开展群众性报矿工作
    东北地质调查所一○四队  赵世彰
    我们的祖国，即将展开大规模的经济建设。我们要修建工厂、铁路、水利……，需要大量的钢铁和铜、铅、锑等等金属。我们祖国蕴藏着无尽的富源，我们要把它找出来，加以利用，建设人民的工业。靠谁去找呢？专家太少，技术人员也不多，必须依靠广大的人民群众注意矿产资源，发现线索报告政府再派人调查，有重点地使用人力，才能解决问题。我国土地广大，人口众多，深山旷野到处有人烟，有些人是祖祖辈辈住在一个地方，那里的每一个山头，每一个河沟，他们都很熟悉，甚至每一把沙土，每一块石头都逃不出他们的眼睛。我们在大兴安岭调查时，一个老工人闭着眼睛可以把附近几十里的地势山形、石头的颜色样子，说得很仔细，他对我们的调查帮助很大。如果全国人民都发动起来，任何地方的矿产都是能够很快发现的。
    在目前发动群众报矿，具备着许多有利的条件：
    第一，有共产党的正确领导，和东北人民政府奖励群众报矿暂行办法的正确实施，启发人民的爱国热情与报矿的积极性。
    第二，几年来的经济建设中，广大群众在实际生活中所受到的教育，使他们对国家的前途充满着信心和希望，对国家建设有很高的热情，一经发动，广大群众就能响应，而且发现矿藏开采后，对国家和地方、个人都是有利的，国家利益与地方利益，目前利益与长远利益是完全一致的。如磐石某屯自开采一个新矿以后，只半年多时间，许多农民由于副业收入增加，纷纷添买牲畜、车辆，修建房子。
    第三，群众报矿工作，和生产是可以紧密结合起来的。不论种地、作工，或者打柴、挖药、挖蘑菇、找人参，或者放牲口、拣树种、采榛子，以至于平常走道，只要随时注意，就可能发现矿产，不必特意到处去找。
    第四，农村的小学教师与群众教师是进行宣传发动群众报矿的基本力量。他们在群众中有威信，他们对祖国建设事业很热心。许多地方的小学教师和群众教师把报矿宣传材料编成快板、洋片、话剧到处宣传，有的教师还要求组织群众报矿委员会，或者组织学生在假期上山旅行采集石头作标本。这些爱国的人民教师的热心宣传和组织，是群众报矿工作普遍展开的一个有力的保证。
    发动群众报矿工作是一件新事，我们的经验还很少，群众对这件事还不很了解，有很多顾虑，我们要向群众宣传解释，打消思想上的顾虑。有的老乡说：“报矿是好事，咱们不认识，怎样找呢？”磐石的五个小孩报矿的事实，对这个问题作了很好的解答。矿石和一般石头是显然不同的，只要我们留意就可以发现。有人说：“人家小孩命好，才能发现矿”，这是迷信的说法，没有道理。矿产就存在山上和地下，它不会走也不会动，谁找它，就会被谁发现。还有一种迷信的想法，认为开矿会“伤地气”，这更没道理了。把地下的矿产拿出来发展经济，可以增强国家力量，也能增加人民的收入，这是实在的；至于“地气”，根本没有那么一回事。至于有人说开矿要“拔房子”，也是多余的顾虑，人民政府处处为人民谋利益，绝不会因开矿而损害群众的利益；相反的，磐石开采一个新矿后，那里盖了许多新房子。“报错了怎么办？”这也不必顾虑，政府根据你所报的矿石来判断，如果不是矿，给你解释，可以不调查；报矿人不负什么责任。但虚报骗人是不可以的，如拿矿山上的石头硬说是别的山上的胡弄人，那是不好的。
    有些人对报矿有了认识，想要报矿，但不知到那里去报矿。到哪去报呢？到政府去报。最好是从基层政府（区、村）报起，层层上转，这样容易掌握情况。过去有些干部忽视群众报矿工作，以官僚主义态度对待群众报矿，老乡送来矿石，或者不管，或者应付一下，把矿石一扔就没事了。这种官僚主义，给国家财富造成的损失是不可计算的。这对祖国建设危害很大，必须彻底纠正。这是一方面。另一方面，报矿人报矿也“不要性急”。有的老乡认为报了就应该调查，调查了就应该开采，越快越好。这种愿望是好的，国家调查地下资源的机构，也要尽量做得快。但是，工作有轻重缓急，而且开矿不是那么简单的事，一定要经过详细的勘察和钻探等。马马虎虎，草率从事会给国家造成很大的浪费。
    为了更好地把群众报矿工作开展起来，今后各地应加强组织领导，大规模展开宣传工作，搜集矿产情报，展开调查，以便更快更好地发现祖国地下资源，迎接我们即将到来的大规模的经济建设！
