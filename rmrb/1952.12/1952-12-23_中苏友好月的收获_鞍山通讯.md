Gains of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month
    ——Anshan Correspondence
    An Gang
    The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" held at Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) has profoundly educated all personnel. The steel production rate of Anshan Iron and Steel reached the level of the historical peak year at the end of 1951, and in 1952 it exceeded this level by 33 percent. The rapid development of Angang's capital construction and the smooth construction of the two major construction projects, 0230 and 0190, are all crystallizations of Sino-Soviet friendship. The great socialist construction ideas, the selfless labor of Soviet experts, and the selfless internationalist spirit demonstrated in these facts have moved and educated the people of Anshan.
    "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" is a good opportunity to systematically receive socialist construction thought and internationalist education. The main task of Angang during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" was to conscientiously examine the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions and establish necessary systems based on this examination to better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
    The suggestions of Soviet experts on Anshan Iron and Steel's production and capital construction are meticulous, from the largest to the smallest details. Each unit has received thousands of suggestions from Soviet experts, most of which were put forward by Soviet experts based on on-site observations. Every suggestion is full of internationalist friendship and boundless love for the Chinese working people. It not only creates a large amount of wealth for the Chinese people, improves labor productivity, and saves a large amount of materials, but it also has a permanent positive effect. That is, through concrete and practical examples, it educates Chinese technicians, staff, and workers from a political, technical, and work style point of view, making it possible for them to further master advanced production technology and management methods.
    The Party and administrative authorities of Angang have always attached importance to the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions. They believe that "Implementing Soviet expert suggestions is the key issue in building Anshan Iron and Steel." Therefore, they have taken various measures to ensure the implementation of various Soviet expert suggestions, such as organizing Soviet expert report meetings, regular technical seminars, short-term training courses, and so on. The Mechanical Installation Company also organized inspection teams to inspect the electrical installation work of the two major construction projects. Based on the inspection results, they established a manual system for implementing Soviet expert suggestions. From technicians to team leaders, Soviet expert suggestions were recorded at any time and reported to superiors for effective implementation.
    However, the past inspections were not universal enough. This time, through the activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," everyone examined the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions one by one. For those that had been implemented, the effects of implementing Soviet expert suggestions were studied. For those that had not been implemented, the reasons for not implementing them were analyzed, and then ideological examination and summarization were carried out.
    In the design workshop, discussions on examining the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions formed a struggle between advanced ideas and backward conservative ideas. This workshop has the largest number of technicians in the entire Anshan Iron and Steel and has the closest working relationship with Soviet experts. These technicians responsible for design are actually the embodiment and implementers of Soviet expert suggestions. According to preliminary inspections, many of the Soviet experts' suggestions have been implemented and have achieved significant results in the work; however, some people have expressed doubts about the Soviet experts' suggestions and do not believe in the superiority of the Soviet experts' suggestions. Some people were skeptical after listening to the Soviet experts' suggestions and went back to look for basis in British and American technical theory books. There were also some people who completely believed in the Soviet experience, but regarded the Soviet experts' suggestions as personal capital and hoarded them, regarding them as capital for showing off their skills. This has brought great losses to the work, because this capitalist society's practice of "technical secrets" and "technical commodification" hinders the growth of our technical strength. To speed up the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, it is necessary to implement Soviet experts' suggestions through collective research and collective labor. What are the consequences of this "taking for oneself" method? The design workshop only knew about more than 40 Soviet expert suggestions before the inspection. After self-reporting, more than 400 suggestions have now been discovered. It can be seen that in the construction department, the inspection of the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions must be regarded as a concrete symbol of strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and conscientiously mastering technology. According to Angang's experience, the most important thing is to publicize the various suggestions of Soviet experts so that everyone knows them and they become the common property of all enterprise personnel.
    The inspection of the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions was also carried out on the construction site. The construction site directors said: "We are all 'white hats' (meaning completely ignorant of technology). Some people have learned a little technology in school in the past, but it is actually of little use. Our ability is to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts." The technical ideological foundation of the two major construction projects, 0230 and 0190, is none other than the designs of Soviet experts and the 1,500 large and small suggestions put forward by Soviet experts during construction. However, judging from the results of the implementation, there are still many problems. An engineer told me: "We realized the advanced nature of Soviet expert suggestions after a certain ideological struggle process. A simple example can be cited: Look at the cement mixing plant in front of us. The Soviet expert saw that the factory building was made of mud and suggested using concrete to plaster the floor. At that time, everyone thought it was a waste and did not implement it. After the expert made suggestions to the company manager and relevant parties, the leadership decided to implement it. Now we understand the benefits of using concrete to plaster the floor and sincerely thank the Soviet expert for the suggestion. It is impossible without using concrete to plaster the floor. If you put sand and gravel on the loess land, the sand will mix with the soil, and it will not be possible to make concrete. At the same time, working on the land will inevitably cause dust to fly, affecting labor efficiency and workers' health."
    There are many similar examples. People have recognized the advanced nature and authority of Soviet expert suggestions in practice. A system for recording Soviet expert suggestions has been established on the construction site. All foremen, section chiefs, technicians, and engineers are responsible for recording the suggestions made by Soviet experts to him and reporting them to the construction site director in a unified manner. In this way, organizational forces can be used to regularly check the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions, and at the same time, these valuable suggestions can be integrated as the most concrete, vivid, and rich teaching materials for advanced technology and ideological education. The personnel of a mechanical installation team talked about 3,000 Soviet expert suggestions during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," which can be compiled into a book. This is the best encyclopedia of electrical installation that combines advanced technical theory with China's specific conditions.
    The inspection of the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions has also achieved another good result, which is to recall and learn from the work attitude and style of Soviet experts. When measuring steel frames, some young technicians were unwilling to climb up to the steel frame for on-site measurement and only made a "rough" estimate of the steel frame. When the Soviet expert saw this, he personally climbed up to the steel frame to measure it, which profoundly educated our technicians. Soviet experts strictly required Chinese technicians to work with a rigorous spirit responsible to the country and the people, just like treating their closest relatives. Some technicians recalled that they used to be most afraid of Soviet experts asking questions about their work, thinking that this was the strictest "examination"; because they were used to being careless, they often could not answer nine out of ten questions. A technician said: "When I couldn't answer, the Soviet expert would patiently teach me, even help me find reference books, take off his clothes and show me as an example. Later, I carefully studied the problem and mastered the situation, and now I can pass general 'examinations'."
    Soviet experts' advanced technical thinking is consistent with their work attitude and work style. This is a noble manifestation of Marxist-Leninist thought directly cultivated by Stalin. We must accept it all and make it the most valuable asset of the Chinese people.

    中苏友好月的收获
    ——鞍山通讯
    安岗
    在鞍钢举行的“中苏友好月”，对于全体人员都起了深刻的教育作用。鞍山钢铁厂钢的生产率在一九五一年底就达到了历史最高年份的水平，一九五二年更超过了这个水平的百分之三十三；鞍钢基本建设的快速发展，○二三○和○一九○两大建设工程的顺利施工和建设，这一切都是中苏友好的结晶。这些事实中所表现出来的伟大的社会主义建设思想，苏联专家的忘我劳动和大公无私的国际主义精神，感动着并且教育着鞍山的人们。
    “中苏友好月”，这是一个系统地接受社会主义建设思想和国际主义教育的好机会。鞍钢在“中苏友好月”的主要工作是认真检查执行苏联专家建议的情况，并在这一检查基础上建立必要的制度，以便更好地学习苏联的先进经验。
    苏联专家对鞍钢生产和基本建设的建议是从大到小无微不至的。每个单位得到的苏联专家建议都是数以千计，其中最大部分是苏联专家们根据现场实际观察结果而提出来的。每一条建议都充满了国际主义的友谊和对中国劳动人民的无限热爱，它不但为中国人民创造了大量财富，提高了劳动生产率，节约了大批物资，而且它发生了永久的积极作用，这就是通过具体实际例子，从政治观点上、技术上、工作作风上教育了中国的技术人员、职员和工人们，使他们有可能更进一步地掌握先进的生产技术和管理方法。
    鞍钢的党和行政方面对于贯彻执行苏联专家建议是一向重视的。他们认为：“贯彻执行苏联专家建议是建设鞍钢的关键问题。”因此他们曾采取了各种措施来保证苏联专家各项建议的执行。例如组织苏联专家的报告会，定期的技术研究会，短期训练班等等。机械安装公司还曾组织检查组，检查两大建设工程的电气安装工作。他们根据检查结果，建立了贯彻执行苏联专家建议的手册制，从技术员到班长，随时随地都把苏联专家建议记录下来，报告上级，以便有效地执行。
    但是，过去的检查是不够普遍的，这次，通过“中苏友好月”的活动，每个人都一件一件地检查了对苏联专家建议的执行情况。执行了的，就研究执行苏联专家建议后所产生的效果；没有执行了的，就分析没有执行的原因，然后从思想上进行检查和总结。
    在设计车间，检查贯彻苏联专家建议情况的讨论形成了先进的思想对落后保守思想的斗争。这个车间在全鞍钢拥有的技术人员为数最多，同苏联专家的工作关系也最密切。这些负责设计的技术人员实际上是苏联专家建议的体现者和执行者。根据初步检查，苏联专家的建议，很多是执行了，并在工作中收到显著成效；但是也有人对苏联专家的建议曾表示怀疑，不相信苏联专家建议的优越性。有些人听了苏联专家建议后半信半疑，回去又翻英美技术理论书籍找根据。还有一些人对苏联的经验完全信服，但把苏联专家建议当作个人资本揣在腰包里，当作自己显露本领的资本。这给工作带来的损失是很大的，因为这种资本主义社会的“技术秘密”、“技术商品化”的作法，妨碍了我们技术力量的生长。而要加强鞍钢建设工作的速度，就必须通过集体的研究和集体的劳动来贯彻执行苏联专家的建议。这种“据为己有”的办法产生了什么结果呢？设计车间在检查前只知道有四十多件苏联专家的建议，经过自报的结果，到现在已经发现了四百多件。由此可见，在建设部门必须把对苏联专家建议执行情况的检查，作为加强中苏友好和认真掌握技术的具体标志。根据鞍钢的经验，最重要的一条是把苏联专家的各种建议公诸于众，使人所共知，成为全体企业人员的共同财产。
    在工地同样也进行了贯彻执行苏联专家建议情况的检查。工地主任们说：“我们都是‘白帽子’（即对技术完全外行的意思），有人过去在学校学了点技术，实际上也无大用处，我们的本领就是认真执行苏联专家的建议。”○二三○和○一九○两大工程建设的技术思想基础不是别的，正是苏联专家的设计和苏联专家在施工中提出的大大小小的一千五百条建议。但是从执行的结果来看，仍然是有着不少问题的。一位工程师对我说：“我们对苏联专家建议的先进性是经过一定的思想斗争过程才认识到的。随便可以举个例子：你看我们眼前的这个洋灰搅拌厂，苏联专家看到厂房是泥土地，便建议用混凝土来抹地。当时大家听了都认为是浪费，没有执行。专家向公司经理和有关方面提出建议后，才由领导上决定执行。现在我们才明白了用混凝土抹地的好处，并且从心里感谢苏联专家的建议。不用混凝土抹地那里能行呢。在黄泥土地上放上沙子、石头子，结果沙子同土混成一起，这就制不成混凝土，同时在土地上工作便一定要尘土飞扬，影响劳动效率和工人健康。”
    类似的例子是很多的。人们在实践中认识了苏联专家建议的先进性和权威性。在工地里开始建立了记录苏联专家建议的制度，所有的领工员、工段主任、技术员、工程师都要负责把苏联专家对他讲的建议记录下来，统一报告工地主任，这样可以运用组织力量，经常检查贯彻执行苏联专家建议的情形，同时也可把这些宝贵的建议综合起来，做为进行先进技术和思想教育的最具体、生动、丰富的教材。一个机械安装队的人员在“中苏友好月”谈出了苏联专家三千条建议，可以整理成一本书，这是一本最好的先进技术理论与中国具体条件相结合的电气安装大全。
    贯彻执行苏联专家建议的检查，还得到了另一个好的效果，这就是回忆和学习苏联专家的工作态度和作风。有的青年技术员在测量钢架时，不愿意爬到钢架上去实地测量，只是“大体上”对钢架作了一个估计。苏联专家看见便亲自爬上钢架去测量，这种行动深刻地教育了我国的技术人员们。苏联专家们像对待最亲密的人一样，严格地要求中国技术人员用对国家对人民负责的精神一丝不苟地去工作。有些技术人员回忆自己过去最怕苏联专家对自己的工作提问题，认为这是最严格的“考试”；因为马虎惯了，常常是十个问题九个答不上来。一位技术员说：“当我回答不出来时，苏联专家便耐心地教导我，甚至帮助我找参考书，脱下衣服作样子给我看，以后我便细心研究问题，掌握情况，现在一般的‘考试’都可以及格了。”
    苏联专家先进技术思想同他们的工作态度、工作作风是一致的，这是在斯大林直接培养下的马列主义思想的崇高表现。我们必须全部把它接受过来，使之成为中国人民最宝贵的财产。
