(Xinhua News Agency, December 30th) According to Vietnam News Agency: The spokesman of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army recently gave a briefing to reporters on the current military situation in Vietnam. The spokesman pointed out:

	I. As a result of the victorious battles fought by the Vietnam People's Army for two months, the French army has lost the northwestern region, which they previously considered relatively safe. The French army suffered a disastrous defeat there recently. The People's Army has annihilated a large part of the French army's active forces in northwestern Vietnam, liberated 80 percent of the northwestern territory, and isolated the remaining French strongholds.

	II. Since the Peace Campaign, the French army has been working to strengthen their positions in the North Vietnamese plains and carry out "sweeping" operations in the guerrilla areas, but the Vietnamese people have rapidly developed guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. The People's Army has removed many important French strongholds and expanded the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines. The French army attempted to salvage their defeat with "mobile government agencies and military forces," but this attempt was severely frustrated. The French army also attempted to concentrate the people by merging villages and implementing a reign of terror. The Vietnamese army and people are resolutely opposed to this vicious tactic of the French army.

	III. In Central and South Vietnam, guerrilla warfare continues, and battles on transportation lines are particularly active.

	IV. The French army is increasingly falling into a passive position. Whether the French army continues to send reinforcements to Na San and Lai Chau, or withdraws troops from the Northwest back to the plains, it will expose their weaknesses. The Vietnamese army and people will exploit the French army's weaknesses to create new victories.

(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, December 30th) According to Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army recently announced: In the newly liberated areas of northwestern Vietnam, from Quynh Nhai and Thuan Giao to Dien Bien Phu, from Moc Chau and Yen Chau to Ma Giang, people's power has been universally established.

The People's Army has recovered the last French stronghold of Phong Tho in Lao Cai province. Under the strong pressure of the People's Army, the French army was forced to withdraw from Phong Tho on the 17th.

    越南人民军总部发言人谈越南军事形势
    西北部新解放地区人民政权普遍建立
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人最近在记者招待会上就最近越南军事形势发表了谈话。发言人指出：
    一、由于越南人民军进行了两个月的胜利战斗，法军已丧失了过去他们认为是比较安全的西北部地区，法军最近在那里遭到了惨败，人民军已经消灭了法军在越南西北部的一大部分有生力量，解放了西北部领土的百分之八十，使法军的残余据点陷于孤立。
    二、自和平战役以后，法军在北越平原曾致力加强他们的阵地和对游击区进行“扫荡”战，但越南人民迅速地发展了敌后游击战。人民军拔除了许多重要的法军据点，扩大了敌后的抗战根据地。法军企图以“流动的政府机关和军事力量”来挽救他们的败局，这一企图遭到了严重的挫败。法军又企图用并村的方法把人民集中起来，实行恐怖的统治。越南军队和人民坚持反对法军这一恶毒的手段。
    三、在中越和南越，游击战仍在继续进行，交通线上的战斗特别活跃。
    四、法军正日益陷于被动的地位，法军今后无论继续派援军到那岑和莱州，或从西北部抽调军队回平原，都会暴露他们的弱点。越南军队和人民将利用法军的弱点，创造新的胜利。
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人最近公布：在越南西北部新解放区，从琼崖、敦交到奠边府，从木州、安州到马江，人民政权已经普遍建立。
    人民军已经收复了老街省法军的最后一个法军据点封土。在人民军的强大压力下，法军于十七日被迫从封土撤退。
