Xinhua News Agency, December 20th:

    The Soviet film artists delegation, led by Feodorov and including members Cherkasov, Ladynina, Chirkov, Petrov, Smirnova, and Pavlov, totaling seven, who were invited to our country and participated in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities after visiting twelve major cities including Beijing and Shanghai, departed Beijing by train on the morning of the 20th to return to the Soviet Union.
    Those who saw them off at the station included Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Zhou Yang and Ding Xilin, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; Zhang Xiruo and Cao Jinghua, Vice Presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; Wang Lanxi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; and representatives from the capital's cultural, artistic, and film circles, including Jian Bozan, Cai Chusheng, Shi Dongshan, Zhang Min, Gao Ge, Lan Ma, Wang Zhenzhi, Xu Xiaobing, Situ Huimin, and representatives from various people's organizations, as well as students from the Beijing Film School, totaling 250 people. Soviet Embassy in China Counselor Vasnov, Soviet Foreign Cultural Association Representative Zhukoff, Soviet Film Export Company Chief Representative in China, Sford, and Deputy Chief Representative Milenikov also came to the station to see them off.
    After arriving in China, Feodorov and others traveled more than 10,000 kilometers by train and plane to participate in the Soviet film exhibition activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" in various places. From Changchun in the Northeast to Kunming in the Southwest, from Shanghai on the coast of the East China Sea to Chongqing in Sichuan Province, they met with more than 430,000 people in various forms and held many symposiums with Chinese film workers. They also visited scenic spots and historical sites and watched performances of various Chinese operas. The people of China warmly welcomed their arrival. Because everyone was already familiar with the heroic and exemplary figures they created on the screen, they regarded them not only as film workers but also as heroic and exemplary figures among the Soviet people. After a month and a half of visits, they gained a deeper understanding of the excellent traditions of China's culture and art and the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Soviet Union. The people of China have also, because of their friendly visits, increased their love for the Soviet people and Soviet films.
    At the station, more than 200 students from the Beijing Film School and representatives of film workers held bouquets, cheered "Stalin-Mao Zedong," and sang the song "People of the World are of One Heart," enthusiastically sending off the Soviet friends; and seven young female film workers presented flowers to Feodorov and others to thank them for their help to the Chinese people.
    Before leaving Beijing, Feodorov and others also repeatedly expressed their reluctance to part with the Chinese people, saying that they would never forget the warm hospitality they received during their visit to China.

    苏联电影艺术工作者代表团离京返苏联
    【新华社二十日讯】应邀前来我国的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团团长费道罗夫，团员契尔卡索夫、拉迪尼娜、契尔柯夫、彼得罗夫、斯米尔诺娃、巴甫洛夫等七人，在先后访问北京、上海等十二大城市，参加了“中苏友好月”活动之后，已在二十日晨乘火车离北京回苏联。
    到车站欢送的有中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞，中央人民政府文化部副部长周扬、丁西林，北京市中苏友好协会副会长张奚若、曹靖华，北京市人民政府副市长吴晗，中央人民政府文化部电影局副局长王阑西和首都文化、艺术、电影界人士翦伯赞、蔡楚生、史东山、章泯、高戈、蓝马、王震之、徐肖冰、司徒慧敏和各人民团体代表以及北京电影学校学生等共二百五十人。苏联驻我国大使馆参赞华士诺夫，苏联对外文化协会代表茹克福，苏联影片输出公司驻华总代表处总代表史福德、副总代表米乐尼克夫等也到车站欢送。
    费道罗夫等来到我国后，为了赴各地参加“中苏友好月”的苏联影片展览活动，在一个半月之内，曾分别乘火车和飞机旅行了一万多公里。从东北的长春到西南的昆明，从东海边的上海到四川省的重庆，他们曾通过各种形式和各地人民四十三万多人见面，并和我国的电影工作者举行了很多次的座谈会，也参观了各地的名胜古迹，观看我国各种戏曲艺术的表演。我国各地人民群众热烈欢迎他们的来到。由于大家早已在银幕上熟悉他们所创造的英雄模范人物，所以不仅把他们当作电影工作者，而是把他们当作苏维埃人民中的英雄模范人物。经过一个半月的访问，他们更加深刻地了解了我国的文化艺术的优秀传统和我国人民对苏联的深厚友谊。我国各地的人民群众，也因为他们的友情的访问，更增加了对苏联人民和苏联影片的热爱。
    在车站上，二百多个北京电影学校的学生和电影工作者的代表都手持花束，欢呼“斯大林—毛泽东”，高唱“全世界人民心一条”歌曲，热情地欢送苏联友人；并有七个年青的女电影工作者向费道罗夫等献花，以感谢他们的工作对中国人民的帮助。
    费道罗夫等在离开北京前，也一再表示对中国人民的依依不舍，认为在中国访问时所受的热烈款待，他们将永远不能忘记。
