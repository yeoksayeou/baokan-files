　　Some people have said that the Marriage Law only benefits women and is detrimental to men; others have said that the Marriage Law only benefits young men and women and is detrimental to others. These are all wrong! Take a look at the story of this family below, and you will know: the Marriage Law benefits men, women, the old, and the young, as well as families and society. It can eliminate many of people's sufferings and give people endless happiness.
　　In Xiliuzhuang, Eighth District, Lushan County, Henan Province, there is a model family—the Feng Zongyi family. This is a well-known harmonious family in the whole county. Feng Zongyi's father is called Shaotang, and his wife is called Zheng Guixiang. His younger sister is nineteen years old, called Zongfan, and is a student and a member of the Communist Youth League. He has two younger brothers, one fifteen and the other twelve, both of whom are in school. A little girl was born in August this year. There is also a grandmother, ninety years old, who is ill, blind in both eyes, and cannot move in bed.
　　But this family was not like this in the past. In the past, Feng Zongyi's family was a well-known "scattered" family in the village. Zongyi originally had a wife named Zhang Ti. When his father arranged the marriage for them, Zongyi was only two or three years old, just learning to walk, and didn't understand anything. When Zongyi grew to be twelve or thirteen years old, people on the street would joke with him: "Zongyi, your father has found you a good wife!" Although Zongyi was young, he was very careful. One day, he secretly ran to Dagangdian Village, where Zhang Ti lived, to see his wife. When he came back, he pouted and didn't eat dinner. Needless to say, the wife was not to his liking.
　　Zongyi's family was poor when he was young, with only two and a half mu of land, not enough for the whole family to drink thin porridge. At that time, it was not easy for poor families to find a wife. His father was an honest man and didn't want to take back what he said. In this way, in the year Zongyi was seventeen, his wife was sent to the Feng family.
　　After the wife entered the door, people slowly saw that something was wrong. The couple were like enemies, not paying attention to each other. The wife was relatively young and didn't do needlework well; she couldn't weave cloth even if she spun thread (it was too coarse to pass through the loom); she sometimes didn't cook the rice well; she spilled some grain on the ground while washing it, and covered it with manure for fear of being talked about. Poor families had few things and couldn't afford to waste them. Although the father was unhappy, he didn't want to show it on his face. The others in the family were also okay, but Zongyi and she were husband and wife, and he really couldn't bear it. The two hadn't slept in the same bed for several years after they got married. Zongyi often thought: my life is over, it's better to die. Zhang Ti also had no intention of living a good life. There were many people in the family but little land, and everyone was not motivated to produce, so life became poorer and poorer. The father saw that Zongyi was lazy and only grumbled. The younger brother had diarrhea from eating uncooked rice and made noise in the middle of the night. The whole family was unhappy.
　　Not long after liberation, land reform was carried out here. Zongyi's family was allocated twelve mu of land. Life was better, but the family was still awkward. The Marriage Law was promulgated in 1950, and Zongyi found a way out: divorce. The wife had also had this idea for a long time. But the father disagreed. Zongyi asked the village cadres to persuade him. The cadres told Shaotang about the benefits of the Marriage Law, saying that his family had been in a mess in the past because Zongyi and his wife were not in harmony. They also cited examples from the village of families being ruined because of feudal marriages. After persuading him for more than ten days, Shaotang agreed. Not long after the divorce, Zongyi joined the militia and became active in his work, and production also became more enthusiastic than before. Zhang Ti returned to her parents' home, found her own partner, got married, and had children.
　　Zongyi listened to people promoting the Marriage Law and knew that nowadays men and women should marry freely and voluntarily, but where could he find a partner? He often kept this matter in mind. One day in September last year, Zongyi's cousin, Gao Qinglan, came to him and said that there was a woman in Beishan named Zheng Guixiang who could weave and spin, was good at fieldwork, and was stable and honest. If Zongyi was willing, she could be an intermediary. Zongyi immediately agreed. A few days later, Zongyi and Guixiang met at Guixiang's home. After talking, Zongyi was very satisfied with Guixiang, and Guixiang was also very satisfied with Zongyi. Guixiang's family had no land in the past. When she was three years old, she was seized by the local tyrant and given to his son; she was a child bride at the age of twelve and was beaten and bullied all day long. It was also the Marriage Law that saved her. She divorced that man.
　　After Guixiang and Zongyi talked, they met a few more times. Guixiang also came to Zongyi's home to see it, and they were considered to have agreed.
　　On the second day of the tenth lunar month last year, Zongyi and Guixiang got married. Everyone in the village praised the new daughter-in-law for being smart and capable. Guixiang and Zongyi were happier in their hearts than on their faces.
　　On the fifth day after the marriage, Zongyi discussed with Guixiang: how to live a good life? Guixiang had suffered for many years and was already willing to live in a good family. After the two discussed it, they felt it was better to have a family meeting to discuss it. That night, after dinner, the father sat happily near the lamp, and the younger brothers and sisters talked and laughed. Zongyi told everyone about his and his wife's intentions. The father agreed first, and the younger brothers and sisters were also happy. The meeting was very lively. Everyone divided the work. Although the father was old, he had experience in production and was elected as the production guidance committee member; light work such as cultivating the land and threshing was the father's responsibility. Heavy work in the fields, such as weeding, sending manure, harvesting, and sowing, was Zongyi's job. Guixiang helped with whatever work was busy. Zongyi and Guixiang were also responsible for buying utensils and selling grain, and were elected as members of the finance and construction committee. In the old society, one of the important reasons for family discord was unfair use of money, so Zongyi proposed that his younger sister serve as the supervisory committee member. The second brother studied well and often ranked first or second in school, so he volunteered to serve as the study committee member. The third brother was still young and went to school for half a day, so his job was to graze cattle and cut grass in his spare time. The grandmother couldn't do anything and needed care, so this job was taken up by Guixiang. After the division of labor was completed, the third brother Zongzhan sang a song to help liven things up.
　　The next day, everyone worked in an orderly manner. The father got up early, picked up a wooden shovel, and went to the threshing ground to spread corn. Zongyi and his younger sister went to the fields to harvest sweet potatoes. The two younger brothers went to school. Guixiang didn't go to the fields early in the morning. She prepared breakfast at home and took care of the patient. In the evening, the second brother Zongsong came back from school and taught everyone to read. He taught the two characters "China" that day. He saw the propaganda about the Marriage Law in the newspaper at school and also told the family about it. The younger sister Zongfan was performing in a play in another village and hadn't returned yet.
　　Zongsong's talk about the Marriage Law touched the father's heart. The father had arranged a marriage for Zongfan since she was a child. The man's name was Zhang Tiedan, a middle peasant, living in Tuluowang Village in this district, four years younger than Zongfan. The father thought Tiedan was not bad when he was a child. He hadn't seen him for many years and didn't know what he was like now. He saw the harmony in the family now and thought of the past, and felt that the harm of arranged marriages by parents was too great. He made up his mind: if his daughter wanted to break off the engagement, he would let her!
　　More than ten days later, it was dinner time. Zongyi had just served his third bowl of noodles when Guixiang took out a rifle and a bullet bag from the house. She was letting Zongyi go out to patrol and guard earlier. This action had become a habit for Guixiang in the past few days. Zongyi left with the gun and went straight to the township people's government. There, the Huai River construction workers were signing up. Zongyi asked the township head to put his name on the list. When he came back, Zongyi woke up his younger brothers and sisters and held a family meeting. He thought that the work in the fields hadn't been finished yet, and he was signing up to control the Huai River, so he wanted to see what everyone's opinions were. Everyone in the family knew that this was a glorious thing and was very happy. The third brother Zongzhan even said: "If you didn't go, I would have mobilized you!" The discussion meeting turned into a farewell meeting. Everyone earnestly told Zongyi to work hard after he arrived at the construction site. Guixiang was afraid that Zongyi would be cold, so she let Zongyi take her little black jacket; she also said that she would go to her parents' home the next day to sell her old five chi of cloth to buy Zongyi a pen so that he could take the time to study at the construction site. The father thought that his son would need money when he went out, so he suggested selling one dou (fifty jin) of soybeans tomorrow and giving it to Zongyi to take with him.
　　Zongyi left on the seventh day of the eleventh lunar month. Before leaving, Guixiang, his younger sister, and younger brothers all saw him off. Guixiang sent him the farthest. During the Spring Festival holiday, Zongyi came back once and went back again soon after. At the construction site, he was the squad leader, diligent in his legs and hands, and worked especially hard. But this spring, when he was pushing a cart, he accidentally injured his right foot by the cart behind him. He stayed in the hospital for more than a month and returned on this year's Dragon Boat Festival.
　　In the meantime, there were some problems with production at home. It wasn't that family discord caused trouble, but that the weather was a bit dry and there was no way to plant corn. Guixiang and the father and the people in the mutual aid group responded to the government's call and came together to fight the drought. Guixiang thought that Zongyi was not at home, and her younger brothers and sisters were in school, so there was less labor, and she should contribute more. She got up early and worked late, carrying water and digging wells. The whole family planted a total of five mu of corn. Soon, it rained, but then it flooded. Zongyi's family dug a ditch in the middle of the field to drain the water. It was no longer a new thing for women to go to the fields to produce in this area; but because Guixiang was particularly capable, the neighbors all praised her. Zongyi's father was even more proud.
　　Before Zongyi came back, he was a little worried about his family. When he came back, he saw that everything was in order inside and out, and he was indescribably happy in his heart. Zongyi thought that if the family wanted to be united and the days were getting better and better, there had to be praise and criticism. In the late May of the lunar calendar, the whole family held a family meeting again and established a system of meeting every three days and summarizing every ten days. At the meeting, good deeds were praised and bad deeds were criticized. This meeting was very effective. The person who received the most praise was the old father, who was even more enthusiastic about production. There were also those who received criticism. For example, Zongsong sometimes only taught the pronunciation when teaching reading, but did not explain the meaning, so he was criticized. Zongyi was once criticized for getting up late. But problems also arose. No one in the family had received any training. At first, those who were criticized, although they accepted it, always felt that something was wrong in their hearts—no one wanted to fall behind! Sometimes it was even revealed on their faces. The father and Zongyi came up with a solution: after the meeting, Zongfan sang, Zongsong played the cymbals to liven things up; the old father also told a joke when he was happy. In this way, the people who were criticized felt happy in their hearts, and their mistakes were also corrected.
　　In the old society, "the husband's sister is half a mother-in-law," and it was difficult for sisters-in-law to get along well. Zongfan and Guixiang were as close as sisters. Zongfan liked to eat cold rice in the summer, and sometimes she came back late from performing, and her sister-in-law had already cooled the rice on the side. Zongfan also often helped her sister-in-law cook, fetch water, and take care of the children. At the end of October this year, Feng Zongyi and Zheng Guixiang took their child and participated in the Lushan County Model Representative Conference for Implementing the Marriage Law. They received prizes at the meeting. When they came back, Guixiang gave her younger sister a pair of socks, and Zongyi gave his second brother a pen and a notebook. The third brother Zongzhan liked pigeons and often put mung beans in his mouth to feed them, but he hoped to have a small ball. This time, there was a ball among the sister-in-law's prizes, which she gave to him when she came back. Zongzhan played for a day and then put it on the windowsill in his sister-in-law's room, saying that he would leave it for his niece to play with when she grew up.
　　"With the whole family working together, yellow soil can be turned into gold." Zongyi's whole family is harmonious, production is good, and life has improved. Last year, the annual income was 2.5 shi of corn (500 jin per shi), 1,000 jin of sweet potatoes, and 7 carts of accumulated fertilizer. This year, the total income is 4 shi of corn, 8,000 jin of sweet potatoes, 500 jin of peanuts, and it is estimated that there will be 25 carts of accumulated fertilizer by the end of the lunar year. This year, they bought 25 chickens, a pig, added farm tools such as hoes and mattocks, made two new quilts, and almost everyone added new clothes.
　　Finally, there was only Zongfan's marriage left. This year, the old father had gone to Tuluowang Village to see the "son-in-law." He didn't see him the first time. He saw him the second time, and even the father didn't like him. He told Zongfan when he came back. In fact, Zongfan had already made up her mind: break off the engagement. She was busy with school a few days ago, and went to the city in early November to participate in the Model Conference for Literary and Artistic Evaluation, and hadn't dealt with this matter. She had already made up her mind: if I don't agree, no one can snatch me away, so she wasn't in a hurry. But she left a message before she left this time: she would break off the engagement when she came back.

    婚姻法把一个不幸家庭变成幸福家庭
    王青
    曾有人说，婚姻法只对妇女有利，对男人不利；也有人说，婚姻法只对青年男女有利，对其他人不利。这些都不对！请看看下面这个家庭的故事，就会知道：婚姻法对男女老少以至家庭、社会都有利。它能消除人们的许许多多的痛苦，给人们以无穷的幸福。
    河南省鲁山县八区西刘庄，有一个模范的家庭——冯宗义家庭。这是全县有名的和睦之家。冯宗义的爹叫少堂，媳妇叫郑桂香。妹妹十九岁，叫宗凡，上着学，是青年团员。两个弟弟，大的十五，小的十二，都在学校念书。今年八月生了个小女孩。还有个奶奶，九十岁的人，有病，两眼看不见，躺在床上不能动。
    但这个家庭过去不是这样。过去冯宗义家是庄上有名的“散落”家庭。宗义原有个媳妇，叫张倜。爹给他们订婚时，宗义才两三岁，刚会走路，什么也不懂。宗义长到十二、三岁，街上的人们就和他开玩笑：“宗义，你爹可给你寻了个好媳妇！”宗义人虽小，心可细。有一天，他偷偷跑到张倜住的大缸店庄去瞧媳妇，回来蹶着嘴，没吃晚饭。不用说，媳妇不对他的意。
    宗义小时家穷，二亩半地，不够全家喝稀的。那时，穷人家找个媳妇不容易，爹又是个厚道人，说出的话不愿意收回来。就这样，在宗义十七岁的那年，媳妇送到了冯家。
    媳妇过了门，人们都慢慢看出不对劲了。两口子像仇人，谁也不理谁。媳妇年纪比较小，针线活作得不像样；纺了线也不能织布（粗得过不了轴）；做饭有时做不熟；淘粮食撒在地上一些，怕人家说，用粪土盖上。穷人家东西少，搁不住糟踏。爹虽然不高兴，可不愿意露在面上，家里别的人也还好些，宗义和她是夫妻，实在受不了。结婚几年，两人没同过床。宗义常想：一辈子完啦，还不如死了好。张倜也没心过日子。家里人多地少，生产又都提不起劲，光景越过越穷。爹看宗义懒散，光嘟噜。弟弟吃了生饭拉肚子，半夜吵闹。全家人都不顺心。
    解放后不久，这里进行了土地改革。宗义家分了十二亩地。日子是好过了些，不过家里还是别别扭扭。一九五○年颁布了婚姻法，宗义找着了路：离婚。媳妇也早有这个意思。可是爹不同意。宗义找了乡干部来劝说他。干部给少堂讲婚姻法的好处，说他家过去闹得一团糟，确是因为宗义两口子不和，更举出了本乡的一些因为封建婚姻闹得家破人亡的例子。劝说了十多天，少堂答应了。离婚后不久，宗义参加了民兵队，工作积极起来，生产也比从前有了兴头。张倜回到娘家，自己找到对象，结了婚，有了孩子。
    宗义听人宣传婚姻法，知道如今男女结婚要自主自愿，可是到那里找对象去？他心里常结记这件事。去年九月的一天，宗义本族的弟媳高庆兰来找他，说是北山有一个妇女，叫郑桂香，能织会纺，地里活俐落，人也稳重老实。要是宗义愿意，她可以做个介绍人。宗义当下答应了。几天以后，宗义和桂香在桂香家里见了面。谈过话，宗义很满意桂香，桂香也很满意宗义。桂香家里过去没地，她三岁时就被恶霸保长霸去，给了他的儿子；十二岁当了童养媳，整天挨打受气。也是婚姻法救了她，她和那个男人离了婚。
    桂香、宗义两人谈过话以后，又见过几次面，桂香还来宗义家看过一趟，就算说准了。
    去年旧历十月初二，宗义和桂香结了婚。村里人人都夸奖新媳妇聪明伶俐。桂香、宗义两人，心里比脸上更高兴。
    结过婚第五天，宗义就和桂香商量：怎样把日子过好？桂香多年受苦，早愿意过个好人家。两人研究了一下，觉得还是开个家庭会议商量一下好。当天晚上，吃罢晚饭，爹喜喜欢欢地坐在近灯处，弟弟妹妹连说带笑。宗义把他夫妇二人的意思向大家说了一遍。爹首先赞成，弟弟妹妹也乐意。会开得很热闹。大家分了工。爹虽然上了年纪，可是生产有经验，被选为生产指导委员；耕地、打场等轻活由爹来负责。地里的重活，如锄草、送粪、收割、播种，是宗义的事。桂香是什么活忙帮助干什么。宗义还和桂香负责买用具，粜粮食，被选为财政建设委员。在旧社会，家庭不和的重要原因之一是用钱不公，因此宗义提议妹妹担任监视委员。二弟学习得好，在学校常考头二名，自报奋勇担任学习委员。三弟还小，又上半天学，闲时放牛、割草是他的事。奶奶不能作事情，得人照顾，这工作由桂香担任起来。分工完了，三弟宗占唱了个歌子，算是助兴。
    第二天，大家干活有了秩序了。爹一早起来，拾起木锨，去场里摊玉米。宗义和妹妹下地收拾红薯。两个弟弟去上学。桂香清早没下地，在家准备早饭，照顾病人。晚上二弟宗松放学回来，教大家识字。这天教的是“中国”二字。他在学校里看见报纸上宣传婚姻法，也顺便向家里的人讲了一下。妹妹宗凡在外村演戏，还没回来。
    宗松讲婚姻法，触动了爹的一桩心事。爹给宗凡从小包办了婚姻。男方叫张铁蛋，中农，住在本区土罗王庄，比宗凡小四岁。爹看铁蛋小时还不错，多少年没见面，不知如今怎样了。他看见现在家里这个和美劲，又想到过去，觉得父母包办婚姻的害处实在太大。他拿定了主意：女儿如果愿意退婚，就随她！
    十多天以后，正是吃晚饭的时候，宗义刚盛上第三碗面，桂香从屋里拿出了步枪和子弹袋。她是让宗义早些出去巡逻放哨。这个动作，几天来桂香已养成了习惯。宗义提着枪出了门，直奔乡人民政府去了。那里治淮民工正报名。宗义让乡长给自己上了名字。回来，宗义喊醒了弟弟、妹妹，开起家庭会来。他是想，现在地里的活还没忙完，自己报名去治淮，看大家有什么意见。家里人谁也懂得这是件光荣事，都很高兴。三弟宗占还说：“你要不去，我还要动员你哩！”商量会变成了欢送会。大家切实嘱咐了宗义，让他到了工地以后要好好作工。桂香怕宗义冷，把自己的小黑袄让宗义带上；还说第二天要去娘家把自己旧存的五尺布卖掉，给宗义买支钢笔，到工地好抽空学习。爹想到儿子出门要用钱，主张明天卖掉一斗（五十斤）黄豆，交宗义带着。
    宗义是旧历十一月七日走的。临走，桂香、妹妹、弟弟都送他。桂香送的最远。旧历年工地放假，宗义回来一趟，不久又去了。在工地上，他是班长，腿勤，手勤，干起活来特别卖力。可是今年春天，他推车的时候，一不小心，右脚被后面的车子轧伤了，住了一个多月的医院，在今年端午节回来了。
    这中间，家里生产出了点问题。倒不是家庭不和闹了事，而是天有点旱，没法种玉米。桂香和爹和互助组的人响应政府的号召，一起来抗旱。桂香想到宗义不在家，弟弟、妹妹又上学，劳动力少，自己更应当多出点力。她起早摸黑，挑水挖井。全家共点种玉米五亩。不久，天下了雨，可是又涝了。宗义家把地中间挖了一条沟，把水排了出去。妇女下地生产，在这一带已经不是新鲜事；可是因为桂香特别能干，邻居们都称赞她。宗义的爹更是得意。
    宗义临回来前，还有点惦记家。回来一看，里里外外井井有条，心里说不出的喜欢。宗义想，家庭要团结得好，日子一天天强起来，得有表扬和批评才好。旧历五月下旬，全家又召开了家庭会，订出三天一开会，十天一总结的制度。会上表扬好的，批评不好的。这个会很起作用。受表扬最多的是老爹，他生产得更起劲了。受批评的也有。比如宗松教识字，有时光教读法，不讲意思，就受了批评。宗义有一次起得晚，也受了批评。但问题又来了。全家人谁也没受过什么锻炼，最初受到批评的人，虽说也接受，心里总觉得有回事——谁也不愿意落在人后啊！有时还露在面上。爹和宗义想了个办法：开完会，宗凡唱歌，宗松打钹，热闹一下；老爹高了兴也讲个笑话。这样，受批评的人心里痛快了，过错也改了。
    在旧社会，“小姑是半个婆婆”，姑嫂很难处好。宗凡和桂香却亲得像姊妹。宗凡夏天爱吃冷饭，有时演戏回来得晚，嫂嫂早把饭凉在一边。宗凡也常帮助嫂嫂做饭，提水，看孩子。今年十月底，冯宗义和郑桂香抱着孩子，参加了鲁山县贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会。他们在会上得到了奖品。回来，桂香送给妹妹一双袜子，宗义送给二弟一支钢笔、一个笔记本。三弟宗占喜欢鸽子，常把绿豆含在嘴里喂它们，但他更希望有一个小皮球。这次嫂嫂的奖品中有一个皮球，回来送给了他。宗占玩了一天，又放在嫂嫂屋里的窗台上，说是留给侄女长大了玩。
    “全家一条心，黄土变成金”，宗义全家和睦，生产搞得好，生活也改善了。去年，全年收入玉米二石五斗（每石五百斤），红薯一千斤，积肥七车。今年，共收入玉米四石，红薯八千斤，花生五百斤，积肥到旧历年底估计可有二十五车。今年买了二十五只鸡，一口猪，添了锄、镢等农具，做了两床新被，差不多每人都添了新衣裳。
    最后就剩下宗凡的婚事了。今年，老爹曾去土罗王庄看过“女婿”。第一次没见到。第二次见到了，连爹也看不中意。回来他告诉了宗凡。其实宗凡早已拿定主意：退婚。她头些日子学校忙，十一月上旬又进城参加文艺评选模范大会，一直没办这桩事。她心里早有了底：我不答应，谁也不能把我抢走，所以并没着急。可是她这次临走前留下了话：回来就退婚。（附图片）
