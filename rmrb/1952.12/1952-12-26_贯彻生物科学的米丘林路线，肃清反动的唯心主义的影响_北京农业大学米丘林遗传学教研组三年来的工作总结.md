Editor's Note: This work summary of the Michurin Genetics Teaching and Research Group at Beijing Agricultural University was written in July this year. After the victorious completion of the ideological remolding of teachers and the "Three-Anti" Movement, the school has begun to show a new atmosphere in learning from advanced Soviet science. Even some comrades who held erroneous views in the past have conducted self-criticism and begun to humbly learn Michurin biological science. This summary illustrates that thoroughly implementing the Michurin line in biological science is a serious process of struggle. This summary is still of reference value today.

On the eve of the National Agricultural College Presidents' Conference, we saw the article "Strive to Uphold the Michurin Direction in Biological Science" published in the People's Daily. Subsequently, we heard reports on the adjustment of departments and curriculum reform at the National Agricultural College Presidents' Conference, which also mentioned the current situation of agricultural production, higher agricultural education, and biological science work. We deeply feel that the problems currently existing in our country's agricultural and biological science circles are indeed very serious. It has been three years since Michurin biological science was systematically introduced to our country, but in this not-so-short period, Michurin science, which is the foundation of modern biology and directly guides agricultural production, has not played its due role. Our higher agricultural education and agricultural science experiment and research work are basically the same old thing, still controlled by the ideological system of Morganism. In the past three years, although many of our schools and research institutions have made certain reforms to courses and research work based on Michurin science, these reforms have only been partial, and have not yet caused comprehensive and fundamental changes. We believe that this situation is the basic reason for the current disconnection between agricultural science theory and practice, and its far lagging behind the demands of practice.

As Michurin science workers, in addition to seriously studying the article "Strive to Uphold the Michurin Direction in Biological Science" and guaranteeing to implement the resolutions of this National Agricultural College Presidents' Conference to transform ourselves and improve our teaching work, we especially take advantage of this period of transition between the old and the new to summarize our work over the past three years.

(I)

After the Chinese People's Revolution achieved basic victory throughout the country, Michurin biological science began to be systematically introduced to our country. With the victorious development of the revolutionary situation, it was quickly spread throughout the country, attracting widespread attention from our country's biological science circles, especially agricultural science circles. In the past, due to the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the vast majority of our agricultural scientists and biologists knew very little or nothing about the Soviet Union and its advanced science. Therefore, when some people heard that Michurin biological science was directly opposed to the Mendel-Morganism that they had always regarded as "classic," they treated this great revolution in science with various thoughts. These thoughts and attitudes, although different in form, were essentially no more than two aspects: supporting and opposing, learning and resisting, earnestly introducing and reconciling and confusing. The struggle between these two aspects is actually the development of Michurin biological science in our country over the past three years.

This situation was no exception at Beijing Agricultural University.

The central issue of the debate between Michurin biological science and Morganism is the issue of heredity and its variability. Therefore, the focus of the struggle is concentratedly reflected in genetics. Genetics is the science that studies the development of organisms, and studies heredity and its variability. The position and viewpoint adopted by every biologist or scientist on this issue can determine which side of the argument he stands on. Fully understanding and correctly estimating this situation is of great help to the future development of Michurin biological science in our country.

(II)

In the autumn of 1949, when Beijing Agricultural University was discussing whether the course of Michurin genetics (then called New Genetics, to distinguish it from the old Morgan Genetics) should be offered, there were two opposing opinions among the teachers. One opinion was that science has no national boundaries, and both Morgan's and Michurin's theories should be learned. They said: "We don't have a complete set of Michurin's theory yet, so students should continue to study Morgan Genetics." However, another opinion was that Michurin genetics and Morgan genetics are fundamentally incompatible. Michurin genetics is scientific and is a weapon for mankind to transform nature; while Morgan genetics is false and useless, and it has become the theoretical basis for imperialism to launch aggressive wars. Therefore, we should no longer use this false and reactionary fallacy to poison young people, but should study advanced scientific Michurin genetics together with the students. As a result of the debate, both Michurin genetics and Morgan genetics courses were offered at the same time, allowing students to "freely choose." (Later, due to the students' extremely high enthusiasm for accepting advanced Soviet science, Morgan genetics was discontinued because too few students selected the course.)

After the Michurin genetics course was offered, many teachers, in addition to the students who selected the course, also attended lectures. Most of them were learning with great hope. However, there were also a few people with impure motives or ulterior motives who not only did not humbly learn Michurin science, but also held a hostile attitude. At different times, targeting different contents of this course, they spread various malicious rumors, attempting to sabotage the teaching work of Michurin genetics. For example, when talking about the philosophical foundation of Michurin biology, they said, "Soviet genetics has political color, it is not pure science." It should be admitted that Michurin genetics serves agricultural practice, serves the greatest interests of the working class, and exposes the falsehood of pseudo-science that serves the exploiting classes. In this sense, it has strong political significance. At the same time, we should also point out that there never has been, nor can there be, any scientific theory that is not guided by a certain philosophical thought; there never has been, nor can there be, any scientist who does not belong to a certain class and serve a certain class. In particular, the fact that Morganism today is so closely attached to imperialism and serves imperialism is something that no Morganist can deny. For example, when we talked about the topic of "Organisms and Environment," the supporters of Morganism declared: "Old genetics also does not deny that the environment affects heredity." They attempted to use this sentence to confuse the fundamental difference between Michurin genetics and Morganism. Michurin genetics believes that organisms and the necessary conditions for their life are unified. When living conditions change, organisms undergo corresponding changes. Changes in living conditions are the initial cause of changes in heredity. Therefore, controlling the living conditions of organisms can control their heredity. However, Morgan genetics is completely the opposite. They believe that the influence of environmental conditions must cause mutations in the fictitious so-called "genes" before they are effective, and these "gene mutations" are undirected, unknowable, and therefore cannot be controlled by human power. In addition, some people cited the theories of many philosophers from Plato to Bacon, and finally concluded that Morganism is also materialism, believing that Morganism is useful in animal selection, while Michurin genetics is limited to plant selection. Therefore, they advocated that Morganism and Michurin genetics should stand on an equal footing, each accounting for half. We believe that such an absurd argument does not need much refutation. Because first, Morganists divide organisms into two absolutely different parts: the mortal body and the immortal genetic material ("genes"), and declare that changes in genetic material are unpredictable in principle. This idealist essence is created by the Morganists themselves, and no one can hide it. Second, the application of Michurin genetics in animals, that is, the countless facts of improving livestock breeds according to feed, feeding conditions, and climate, and selecting animals according to the principle of creating feed and feeding conditions according to livestock breeds, can never be denied by anyone.

There is also a theory that today's Morganism is no longer the era of "three-to-one" and "nine-to-three-to-three-to-one" [Note]. The implication is that some comrades expressed great impatience with using the formulas of "three-to-one" and "nine-to-three-to-three-to-one" to criticize Morganism, and they themselves believed that Morganism had been greatly "developed." Regarding this understanding, some comrades pointed out at the time: It is inappropriate to equate Morganism with Mendel's law, because Morganism has indeed "developed." It has "developed" from the Mendel era to the Morgan era, and has "developed" from the "three-to-one" and "nine-to-three-to-three-to-one" pea law to the study of human "artificial insemination" (the title of a paper by Morganists read at the Eighth International Congress of Genetics held in Stockholm in 1948) and other areas within the scope of reactionary eugenics. The research on this "artificial insemination" is an attempt to make people believe that only the nations of imperialist countries are the "superior nations" on earth; only imperialist aggressors are the "good seeds" of mankind. From the pea law to advocating for imperialist racism, is this the "development" of Morganism, isn't it obvious enough!

In addition, they also continuously spread fallacies such as "old genetics also talks about hybridization" and "grafting and vernalization also exist in the United States" to defend Morganism. In short, in their view, the dispute between Michurin genetics and Morganism is completely meaningless and was created by the Soviet Union. Therefore, when talking about the major event of the 1948 meeting of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences exposing the essence of the reactionary biological science line, they said, "This is a big mistake of the Soviet Union, and future facts will prove it." Today, they should be told that facts over the past three years have proved, and will continue to prove, that it is not the Soviet Union that is wrong, but precisely the subjective wishes of the supporters of Morganism. Advanced Soviet biological science under the care of the great Comrade Stalin has been, and will continue to be, infinitely prosperous and developed in the agricultural practice of socialist and people's democratic countries.

(III)

Our teaching work over the past three years has been carried out under such objective conditions. All comrades in the teaching and research group have persisted in their work unremittingly, regardless of all difficulties. For example, in terms of teaching materials, there were very few materials at the beginning, and we did not understand Russian. We only relied on some materials collected sporadically by comrades in various aspects for systematic arrangement, so it was not complete enough, and could not meet the learning requirements of the students. Thanks to the help of Soviet genetics expert Dr. Nuzhdin and Soviet expert Professor Suegina, our teaching content has gradually improved. The fact that the work of the teaching and research group over the past three years has been able to conscientiously adhere to the basic spirit of Michurin biological science without being confused or shaken by any external forces is due to the direct help given to us by Soviet experts, in addition to the hard work of all comrades. This is a very important factor.

Because we have adhered to the basic spirit of the correct Michurin biological science, the teaching effect has also been very significant. The vast majority of students have significantly improved their understanding after studying Darwinism and Michurin genetics, and have a preliminary ability to criticize some erroneous concepts in biology. Michurin biological science (including Darwinism and Michurin genetics) requires us to understand the occurrence and development of organisms, and to understand heredity and its variability, all must start from a basic concept - the concept of the unity of organisms and their living conditions. Only from this concept can the complexity and regularity of the biological world be understood; and only from this concept can it provide mankind with full possibilities for transforming nature. Once such a dialectical concept is instilled into the mind of any young student, its role is not limited to eliminating metaphysical idealism Mendel-Morganism in the category of genetics, but is used as a weapon to eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology in the entire field of biology.

However, the road we have traveled in the past three years has not been smooth. We ourselves, like other agricultural science workers in our country, have also been educated for a long time under the ideological system of the bourgeoisie. In our minds, there are also remnants of bourgeois academic thoughts to varying degrees, especially the ideological influence of reactionary Mendel-Morganism. Therefore, the first enemy encountered in studying Michurin genetics is this residual poison existing in our own minds. This requires us to not only humbly learn Michurin genetics itself, but more importantly, we must strictly transform ourselves politically and constantly improve our awareness. Only in this way, only after we can gradually master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, can we correctly understand Michurin genetics, and can we constantly improve this understanding. Experience has proved that comrades who make faster political progress are often comrades who understand Michurin genetics more deeply.

At the same time, the road over the past three years has also clearly shown that the attack launched by bourgeois academic thought against the academic thought of the working class - Michurin biological science - is very rampant. Although this situation has been fundamentally changed after the great "Three-Anti" Movement, most teachers, except for a very few individuals, have expressed their willingness to learn Michurin biological science from scratch. This transformation should be welcomed. However, this does not mean that there is no need to carry out struggles in the future work of developing Michurin biological science. On the contrary, the influence of bourgeois ideology on the minds of our country's biologists and agricultural scientists is deeply rooted and can never be completely eliminated in the short term. After the convening of this National Agricultural College Presidents' Conference, the theories and viewpoints of Michurin biological science will be implemented in every subject of biology and agricultural science. In this way, the great expansion of the touched surface will naturally increase the difficulties that may be encountered. The obstruction of bourgeois academic thought will still be a major difficulty among them. Therefore, in order to correctly implement the resolutions of this National Agricultural College Presidents' Conference and fundamentally change the face of our country's higher agricultural education, we believe that every agronomist and biologist should deeply be vigilant about this, strive to transform themselves, study Marxism-Leninism, and actively launch a ruthless and irreconcilable struggle against all bourgeois thoughts existing in various disciplines at any time and any place.

[Note] According to Mendel-Morganism, heredity is determined by so-called "genes." "Genes" exist in pairs on chromosomes, and each pair of "genes" combines according to mathematical probabilities, one pair being three-to-one, two pairs being nine-to-three-to-three-to-one, and so on. In fact, the manifestation of heredity is determined by living conditions. The offspring of any hybrid cannot have a fixed ratio. Even the materials obtained by Mendel himself in his experiments had several hybrid offspring that were far from the three-to-one ratio.

    贯彻生物科学的米丘林路线，肃清反动的唯心主义的影响
    ——北京农业大学米丘林遗传学教研组三年来的工作总结
    编者按：北京农业大学米丘林遗传学教研组的这个工作总结，是今年七月间写成的。在教师思想改造和“三反”运动胜利结束后，该校在学习苏联先进科学方面，已开始出现了一片新的气象。就是过去一些持有错误观点的同志，也都进行了自我批评，开始虚心地学习米丘林生物科学。这个总结说明了贯彻生物科学的米丘林路线，乃是一个严重的斗争过程。这个总结在今天还是有参考价值的。
    在全国农学院院长会议召开的前夕，我们看到人民日报发表的“为坚持生物科学的米丘林方向而斗争”的文章，接着，又在全国农学院院长会议上听到有关院系调整和课程改革的报告，报告中也提到目前农业生产、高等农业教育和生物科学工作的现状。我们深切地感到，目前存在于我国农学界和生物学界的问题，确是十分严重的。米丘林生物科学被有系统地介绍到我国已经三年了，但是在这个并不算短的时期内，作为现代生物学基础，而又直接指导农业生产的米丘林科学，我们却没有发挥它应有的作用。我们高等农业教育和农业科学的试验、研究工作，基本上还是老一套，还是为摩尔根主义的思想体系所控制着的。三年以来，虽然我们不少学校和研究机构，也曾根据米丘林科学，对于课程、研究工作进行了某些改革；但是这些改革只是局部的，它还远没有引起全面的基本变化。这种情况，我们认为就是形成今天农业科学理论和实际脱节，而且又远远落后于实践要求的基本原因。
    作为米丘林科学工作者，我们除了认真学习“为坚持生物科学的米丘林方向而斗争”一文，并保证执行这次全国农学院院长会议的决议，以改造我们自己，改进我们教学工作外，特别趁这个新旧交替的时期，总结一下我们三年来的工作。
    （一）
    中国人民革命在全国范围内取得基本胜利以后，米丘林生物科学开始被有系统地介绍到我国来，并且随着革命形势胜利的发展，很快地就被传播到全国各地，引起我国生物学界，特别是农学界的广泛注意。过去由于国民党长期的反动统治，使得我们绝大多数农学家和生物学家们对于苏联和苏联的先进科学，知道得很少，或者毫无所知。因此，当有些人一听到米丘林生物科学是与他们所一向奉为“经典”的孟德尔、摩尔根主义正相反对的时候，他们是怀着各种各样的想法，来对待这一科学上的伟大革命的。这些想法及所持的态度，尽管在形式上各有不同，但在本质上不外两方面：拥护的和反对的，学习的和抗拒的，认真介绍的和调和混乱的。这两方面的斗争，实际上也就是米丘林生物科学三年来在我国的发展的情况。
    这种情况，在北京农业大学也没有例外。
    米丘林生物科学与摩尔根主义争论的中心问题，是关于遗传性及其变异性的问题；因此斗争的焦点，就集中地反映到遗传学上。遗传学是研究生物体发育，研究遗传性及其变异性的科学。每一个生物学家或科学家在这个问题上所采取的立场、观点，就可以确定他是站在争论的那一方面。充分地认识与正确地估计这种情况，对于米丘林生物科学今后在我国的发展，是有很大的帮助的。
    （二）
    一九四九年秋，北京农业大学在讨论米丘林遗传学（当时称新遗传学，以区别于旧的摩尔根遗传学）的课程应否开设的时候，在教师中间就存在着两种相反的意见。一种认为科学是没有国界的，无论摩尔根或米丘林的理论都应该学。并且他们说：对于米丘林学说，我们还没有一套，因而就应该让学生继续学习摩尔根遗传学。但另一种意见则认为米丘林遗传学与摩尔根遗传学在根本性质上是不相容的。米丘林遗传学是科学的，是人类改造自然的武器；而摩尔根遗传学则是虚伪无用的，它已经成为帝国主义发动侵略战争的理论根据。因此我们就不应该再以这种虚伪反动的谬论去毒害青年，而应该与同学一起去学习先进的科学的米丘林遗传学。争论的结果，是米丘林遗传学与摩尔根遗传学两课程同时都开，让同学们去“自由抉择”。（直到后来，由于同学们接受苏联先进科学的热情极高，摩尔根遗传学才因选课的同学太少而停开。）
    米丘林遗传学的课程开设之后，除去选课的同学外，好多教师也去听讲。他们之中的大多数，都是怀着很高的希望去学习的。但是也有少数动机不纯或别有用心的人，他们对于米丘林科学，不仅不虚心学习，反而抱着敌对的态度。在不同的时期，针对这门课程不同的内容，他们散布着各种不同的带着恶意的流言，企图破坏米丘林遗传学的教学工作。例如，当讲到米丘林生物学的哲学基础时，他们就说，“苏联的遗传学带有政治色彩，不是纯科学”。应该承认，米丘林遗传学服务于农业实践，服务于工人阶级的最大利益，揭穿了为剥削阶级服务的伪科学的虚妄。在这种意义上说，它是具有强烈的政治意义的。同时，我们也应该指出，从来没有，也不可能有任何一种科学理论，不是受一定的哲学思想所指导着的；从来没有，也不可能有任何科学家，不是从属于一定的阶级，并为一定的阶级服务着的。特别是像今天摩尔根主义那样密切地依附于帝国主义，为帝国主义效劳的事实，更是任何一个摩尔根主义者所不可能否认的。又如，当我们讲到“生物与环境”这一题目的时候，摩尔根主义的拥护者宣称：“环境影响遗传，旧遗传学也并没有否认”。他们企图用这句话来混淆米丘林遗传学与摩尔根主义的根本区别。米丘林遗传学认为生物及其所必需的生活条件乃是统一的，生活条件改变时，生物即发生相应的改变；生活条件的改变，就是遗传性改变的最初原因。因此控制生物的生活条件，即可控制它的遗传性。但是摩尔根遗传学则完全相反，他们认为环境条件的影响，必须引起虚构的所谓“基因”发生突变以后，才是有效果的，而这种“基因突变”又是无定向的、不可知的，因而也是人力所不能控制的。此外，更有人旁征博引了从柏拉图到培根的许多哲学家的理论，最后结论到摩尔根主义也是唯物论，认为摩尔根主义在动物选种上是有用的，而米丘林遗传学只限于植物选种方面，因而主张摩尔根主义与米丘林遗传学分庭抗礼，各占一半。对于这样一种荒谬透顶的言论，我们认为是用不到多加批驳的。因为第一，摩尔根主义者把生物体分为绝然不同的必死的躯体与永生不灭的遗传物质（“基因”）两部分，并宣称遗传物质的变化在原则上是不能预见的。这种唯心论的实质，是摩尔根主义者自己所造成，是决没有人能够掩饰得了的。第二，米丘林遗传学在动物方面的应用，即按照饲料、饲养条件和气候来改良家畜品种，以及按照家畜品种来造成饲料和饲养条件的原则而进行动物选种的无数事实，也绝不可能为任何人矢口否认所可抹煞的。
    还有这样一种理论，认为今天的摩尔根主义已经不是“三比一”、“九比三比三比一”〔注〕的时代了。言外之意，是对于某些同志用“三比一”、“九比三比三比一”的公式来批判摩尔根主义，表示极大的不耐烦，而他们自己则认为摩尔根主义已经是大大地“发展”了。对于这种认识，当时就有同志指出：把摩尔根主义等同于孟德尔定律是不妥当的，因为摩尔根主义的确是“发展”了。它已经从孟德尔时代“发展”到摩尔根时代了，已经从“三比一”、“九比三比三比一”的豌豆定律“发展”到研究人类的“人工受孕法”（一九四八年在斯德哥尔摩召开的第八次国际遗传学会上宣读的摩尔根主义者的论文题目）等属于反动的优生学范围以内了。这种“人工受孕法”的研究，就是企图叫人相信：只有帝国主义国家的民族，才是地球上的“优等民族”；只有帝国主义侵略者，才是人类的“良种”。从豌豆定律到为帝国主义的种族主义张目，这就是摩尔根主义的“发展”，难道还不够明显吗！
    此外，他们还连续不断地散布什么“旧遗传也讲杂交”啦、“嫁接与春化美国也有”啦等等为摩尔根主义作辩护的谬论。总之，在他们看来，米丘林遗传学与摩尔根主义之争，完全是无意义的，是苏联制造出来的。因此在谈到一九四八年列宁全苏农业科学院的会议揭穿反动的生物学路线实质这一重大事件时，他们就说，“这是苏联的大错，以后的事实会证明的”。今天应该告诉他们，三年来的事实证明了，以后并将不断地证明着，错了的不是苏联，而正是摩尔根主义拥护者的主观愿望。在伟大的斯大林同志关怀下的先进的苏维埃生物科学，已经在，并将继续在社会主义和人民民主国家的农业实践中得到无限的繁荣与发展。
    （三）
    三年来我们的教学工作就是在这样一种客观条件下进行着的。教研组的全体同志不顾一切的困难，始终不懈地坚持着自己的工作。譬如，在教材内容方面，起初材料很少，我们又不懂俄文，只是靠同志们在各方面零星搜集到的一些材料加以系统整理，因此就很不够完整，远不能满足同学们的学习要求；由于苏联遗传学专家努日金博士及苏联专家绥吉纳教授的帮助，才使我们的教学内容逐渐完善。三年来教研组的工作，能够认真坚持米丘林生物科学，而不为任何外力所混乱、动摇，除了全体同志们的努力工作外，苏联专家所给予我们的直接帮助，是一个很重要的因素。
    由于我们坚持了正确的米丘林生物科学的基本精神，在教学上所收到的效果，也是非常巨大的。绝大部分同学学习了达尔文主义与米丘林遗传学以后，在认识方面有了显著的提高，对于生物学中一些错误观念，有了初步的批判能力。米丘林生物科学（包括达尔文主义与米丘林遗传学），要求我们认识生物的发生与发展，认识遗传性及其变异性，都必须从一个基本的观念——生物与其生活条件统一的观念为出发点。只有从这一观念出发，生物界的复杂性与规律性，才是可以认识的；也只有从这一观念出发，才能给人类提供改造自然的充分可能性。这样一个辩证的观念，一经贯注于任何一个青年同学的思想后，它所起的作用，就不仅限于在遗传学的范畴内肃清了形而上学的唯心论的孟德尔、摩尔根主义，而且是被当作一个武器，在全部生物学的领域中，清除资产阶级思想影响了。
    但是三年来我们所走过的道路，并不是平坦的。我们自己同我国的其他农业科学工作者一样，也是长期地在资产阶级的思想体系之下受过教育的。在我们的思想上，也残存着程度不同的资产阶级学术思想，特别是反动的孟德尔、摩尔根主义的思想影响。因此，在学习米丘林遗传学当中，首先碰到的敌人，就是存在于自己思想上的这种余毒。这就要求我们除了虚心地学习米丘林遗传学本身外，更重要的还必须在政治上严格地改造自己，不断地提高自己的觉悟程度。只有这样，只有在我们能够逐渐地掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器以后，我们才有可能正确地认识米丘林遗传学，才有可能不断地提高这种认识。经验证明，政治上进步较快的同志，也常常是对于米丘林遗传学理解得较深刻一些的同志。
    同时，三年来的道路也清楚地说明了资产阶级学术思想对工人阶级学术思想——米丘林生物科学——所举行的进攻，是十分猖狂的。这种情况虽然在伟大的“三反”运动以后，已经有了基本的改变，除了极个别的人以外，绝大部分教师，都表示愿意从头学习米丘林生物科学。这种转变，是应该欢迎的。但是，这并不能说，在今后开展米丘林生物科学的工作中，就不需要进行斗争了。恰恰相反，资产阶级思想在我国生物学家与农业科学家思想上的影响，是根深蒂固的，决不可能在短期内就全部清除。这次全国农学院院长会议召开以后，米丘林生物科学的理论与观点，将要贯穿到每一个生物学与农业科学的学科中。这样，触及面的大大扩展，可能遭受到的困难，自然就会增加，其中资产阶级学术思想的阻挠，将仍然是一个主要的困难。因此，为了正确地执行这次全国农学院院长会议的决议，从根本上改变我国高等农业教育的面貌，我们认为每一个农学家与生物学家都应该深深地警惕这一点，努力改造自己，学习马克思列宁主义，积极地随时随地向一切存在于各种学科中的资产阶级思想，展开无情的不调和的斗争。
    〔注〕根据孟德尔、摩尔根主义的说法，遗传性是由所谓“基因”决定的。“基因”成对地存在于染色体上，每对“基因”按照数学上的或然率组合，一对为三比一，两对为九比三比三比一，以此类推。事实上，遗传性的显现，是由生活条件所决定的，任何杂种的后代都不可能有固定不变的比例，就连孟德尔本人试验所得的材料，也有若干杂种后代，距三比一的比例甚远。
