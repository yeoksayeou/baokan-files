Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Most state-owned steel plants nationwide had overfulfilled their annual production plans for major products by the end of November. Among these, the output of iron ore from the Northeast Benxi Coal and Iron Company and the Southwest Plant No. 209 exceeded the plan by 10% to 80%; the output of pig iron from the Central China Steel Company, Southwest Plant No. 101, and Plant No. 209 exceeded the plan by 4% to 28%; the output of steel from Benxi, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other steel plants exceeded the plan by 5% to 35%; and the output of steel products from Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Central China Steel Company, and Tianjin, Southwest Plant No. 102, and other steel plants exceeded the plan by 2% to 17%.

The main reason why the national steel system was able to complete its annual production plan for major products ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment was that the workers and staff of various factories and mines, in response to Chairman Mao's great call for "increase production and practice economy," brought into play their initiative and creativity in labor and promoted a series of advanced experiences. These experiences are: the "all-wind, fast-charge, smooth-operation method" in iron smelting, the "fast steelmaking operation method" in steelmaking, and the "fast rolling operation method" in steel rolling.

    全国大部分国营钢铁厂
    提前完成主要产品全年生产计划
    【新华社二十二日讯】全国大部分国营钢铁厂的主要产品截至十一月底已超额完成了全年的生产计划。其中铁矿石的产量，东北本溪煤铁公司和西南二零九厂超额百分之十到八十；生铁的产量，华中钢铁公司、西南一零一厂和二零九厂超额百分之四到二十八；钢的产量，本溪、天津、唐山等炼钢厂超额百分之五到三十五；钢材的产量，鞍山钢铁公司、本溪煤铁公司、华中钢铁公司及天津、西南一零二等炼钢厂超额百分之二到十七。
    全国钢铁系统中的主要产品能够提前超额完成全年生产计划，主要是各个厂矿的职工在响应毛主席“增产节约”的伟大号召下，发挥了劳动上的积极性与创造性，并推行了一系列的先进经验。这些经验是：炼铁中的“全风快料顺行操作法”，炼钢中的“快速炼钢操作法”及轧钢中的“快速轧钢操作法”。
