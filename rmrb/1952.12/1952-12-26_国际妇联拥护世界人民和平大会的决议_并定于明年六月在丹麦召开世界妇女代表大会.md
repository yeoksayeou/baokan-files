The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation calls on all women and all mothers to stand at the forefront of the struggle to: make the spirit of consultation triumph over forceful solutions; immediately stop the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other places; ban atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons and other weapons that exterminate civilians, and urge all countries to abide by the 1925 Geneva Protocol; recognize the right of all peoples to national independence; develop international material and cultural exchange; resolve the German and Japanese issues through consultation; establish international supervision to achieve comprehensive, simultaneous, gradual, and proportional disarmament; and conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact as a major guarantee for easing international tensions and safeguarding peace. The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation urges national democratic women's organizations and all women's groups working for peace to support the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress, widely publicize them, and actively strive to implement them, thereby strengthening the cause of peace.

    The meeting also decided to convene the World Women's Congress in Denmark in June 1953.
