Also at the airport to see them off were Gudev, chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, and Zhukfov, representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, among others.

Since arriving in our country at the end of October, Tikhonov and his delegation have visited Beijing, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places. With a high spirit of internationalism, they introduced the experiences and achievements of Soviet culture, art, and science to cultural, artistic, and scientific workers throughout our country. They gave special reports in various places on Sino-Soviet friendship, dramatic art, musical creation, historical science, and agricultural science. Through various symposiums, they answered many specific questions raised by our country's cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, including the situation of Soviet scientific research work, Soviet agricultural collectivization, and ideological content and national form in literature and art. At these symposiums, they expressed their sincere concern for our country's cultural, artistic, and scientific work, and repeatedly expressed their willingness to contribute all their work experience to the cultural and scientific construction of the Chinese people. The broad masses of the people and cultural, artistic, and scientific workers in various parts of our country also expressed a warm welcome to their visit, because their visit not only played a practical role in helping our country's cultural, artistic, and scientific work, but also further strengthened and consolidated the cultural exchanges and friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

On the morning of the 4th, at the airport in Beijing, cultural workers from China and the Soviet Union expressed their infinite reluctance to part. The Chinese cultural workers who came to see them off repeatedly instructed the Soviet cultural envoys to convey the gratitude and respect of the Chinese people to the great Stalin and the Soviet people.
