    The Stockpile Volume of the First Warehouse of the China Textile Corporation, Central South Region, Has Increased

    The First Warehouse of the China Textile Corporation, Central South Region, has improved its warehouse storage volume by studying advanced Soviet storage methods, rationally using warehouse space, and implementing area quota management methods, bringing warehouse work onto a planned footing. This has reduced wasted warehouse capacity, accelerated material turnover, corrected the shortcomings of discrepancies between goods and accounts, and increased the warehouse area utilization rate to 85%, increasing the storage volume by 34.87% compared to the past. The storage quota managed by each warehouseman has reached 1,044 square meters, exceeding the central government's prescribed storage quota of 480 square meters by 117.5%.
    The work of the First Warehouse of the China Textile Corporation, Central South Region, was quite chaotic in the past. This warehouse, acting as a transfer point, had a total of twenty-eight storage rooms, mainly for storing cotton and packaged goods. Warehouse cadres believed that warehouse work meant "watching the piles" and "managing the keys," with "goods coming into the warehouse, filling it up as the measure." The storage of goods was unplanned, with goods entering the warehouse first being piled at the innermost part of the storage room, often blocking the aisles. If the goods that had entered first needed to be shipped out, they had to be overturned, which not only wasted manpower and labor but also increased the loss of goods. Because the stacks of goods were very messy, goods were often "misidentified" when they were shipped out, resulting in discrepancies between accounts and goods. In this way, it was impossible to check things during normal times, and it was difficult to find the root cause when mistakes occurred, which made the warehouse staff develop the negative idea that "no stacking means no mistakes, less stacking means fewer mistakes, and more stacking means more mistakes." When the Central Ministry of Commerce called for learning from advanced Soviet experience and implementing warehouse area quotas on a trial basis, the warehouse staff thought, "We have little education, and this set of scientific methods cannot be done by people with less than a middle school education." The stevedores said, "We have been stacking cotton like this for decades."
    Under the encouragement of Party and administrative leaders, activists took measuring tapes and measured the area haphazardly in the warehouse, marked aisles, and calculated how many "car units" could be stacked (an area unit calculated based on the volume of a thirty-ton train car, with each car unit being 64 cubic meters), how high a "car unit" should be stacked, and how to lay the foundation (the lowest layer of the stack of goods). They measured the area and conducted specific experiments, stacking several stacks of goods in one go. However, they had no experience and did not calculate well, and the stacks of goods were crooked and the results were not good. The thinking of many cadres and workers became even more confused. Some said: "What is said is one thing, and what is done is another." Some said: "It will only work if the packaging of the incoming cotton is consistent, which is not possible at present." Some said: "Bricklayers still need to use lime mortar to stick bricks, how can cotton bales be stacked neatly!" Some even said: "We knew it wouldn't work a long time ago, but you insisted on stacking it!" The leadership analyzed the reasons for the failure: too many stacks of goods were being tested, the forces were scattered, the stacking was not done properly, and the calculations were not thorough, all of which could be improved. They continued to encourage the activists to focus on stacking a typical stack of goods in one warehouse. The warehouse director personally led some cadres and security comrades, measured the area of one "car unit," and changed the base (the lower layer) to cross-arrangement, and finally the experiment was successful. Some individual workers at this time still said: "To be so neat, it's simply embroidery." Some cadres said: "It's okay to do it yourself, but it won't work if the workers are unwilling to do it." But most of the workers saw that the first typical stack had been successfully tested, and their confidence had been improved. They tested the second typical stack, and the results were very good. At this time, some people still thought: "It's okay to put on a show now, but it won't work when the goods flood in." The leadership then guided everyone to conduct a transfer station experiment. The iron facts finally educated the masses: the advanced Soviet experience can be completely imitated and implemented, and the only thing hindering our progress is serious conservative thinking.
    The relationship between cadres and stevedores was not close enough in the past. In the process of implementing the "car unit" area quota work, the cadres changed their incorrect views on the workers and clarified the idea of relying on the workers. When implementing the transfer station experiment, the storekeepers used measuring tapes to measure and calculated precisely, calculating that a certain unit area could stack 382 bales of cotton. The warehouse director Sun Jingwen said to the workers: You also calculate how many can be stacked! One worker took a step, walked around, looked up and calculated, and replied: More than 370 bales. This number was not far from the number measured and calculated by the cadres. The cadres realized that the workers' experience was indeed rich, and everyone immediately held a meeting to study how to rely on the workers and actively contact the workers. When the warehouse director led the measurement of the "car unit" area quota, he personally studied with the workers. When a lot of cotton came into the warehouse, overtime was required, and the warehouse director took a lot of care of the workers' lives. The workers also understood a truth: learning from the advanced Soviet experience can stack more cotton, save property for the country, and ensure that we will have a better life in the future. In order to make the stack reach the car unit area quota standard, they created the method of "borrowing feet to build jumps" and "building flying jumps," which solved the technical difficulties of stacking high.
    The storage volume of the First Warehouse has increased, and the warehouse staff are more proactive in their work. Everyone has calculated the accounts. Because the storage volume has increased by 34.87%, more than 730 million yuan of warehouse rental costs can be saved in one year. From then on, the labor loss and loss of turnover are gone. The storekeepers' storage work has become planned. If you ask a storekeeper how many "car units" can be stacked in warehouse No. 204, he will answer without hesitation: 27.69, and tell you how many "car units" can still be stacked, which is equivalent to how many bales of cotton. Now each stack of goods is clear at a glance, with a card hanging on it, indicating how many "car units" are in this stack and how many bales there are. The phenomenon of storekeepers being busy, chaotic, and unevenly distributed in labor has also been corrected. With the needs of the new work, they organized dedicated mutual aid groups. When goods come into the warehouse, everyone cooperates with a division of labor to achieve order. They deeply realized the value of advanced Soviet experience and strengthened their determination to improve enterprise management and implement economic accounting.

    中国花纱布公司中南区公司第一仓库的仓存量提高了
    靳吾
    中国花纱布公司中南区公司第一仓库学习苏联先进保管方法，合理使用仓库，实行面积定额管理方法，使仓库工作走向了计划化：减少了仓容浪费现象，加速了物资周转，纠正了货账不符的缺点，使仓库面积使用率达到了百分之八十五，仓存量比过去提高了百分之三四点八七。每个保管员保管定额已达到一、○四四平方公尺，超过中央规定保管定额四八○平方公尺百分之一一七点五。
    中国花纱布公司中南区公司第一仓库的工作，过去是相当混乱的。这个仓库是吞吐性的，共有二十八个库房，以堆存棉花和打包为主。仓库干部认为干仓库工作就是“看堆”、“管钥匙”，“货来进仓，堆满了算数”。存放货物是无计划的，先进仓的货物堆在仓房最里面，常常把走道塞满了。如果要把先进的货物运出去，就必须翻堆，这样不但要浪费力资和劳动力，而且要增加货物的亏耗。由于货垛很乱，货物出仓时往往“张冠李戴”，造成账货不符的现象。这样，平时没法检查，出了错误也难找出根子，使得仓库工作人员产生了“不堆（货）没错误，少堆少错误，多堆多错误”的消极思想。当中央商业部号召学习苏联先进经验，试行仓库面积定额时，仓库工作人员想：“我们文化低，这一套科学办法，非有中学以上文化程度的干不了。”搬运工人们说：“我们堆了几十年棉花都是这样堆的。”
    在党和行政领导干部的鼓舞下，积极分子拿着皮尺，在库房里横七竖八地测量面积，划走道，计算可以堆多少“车单位”（一个三十吨火车车皮容积计算的面积单位，每一车单位为六十四立方公尺），一个“车单位”应该堆多高，如何打脚（货堆的最底层）。他们量好了面积，进行了具体试验，一口气堆了几个货垛。但是，他们没有经验，又没有计算好，货垛歪七扭八，成绩不好。许多干部和工人的思想就愈加混乱了。有的说：究竟说是说，做是做。有的说：除非来的棉花包装一致才行，目前还行不通。有的说：泥水匠砌墙还要用石灰泥来粘，棉花包怎么会堆得整齐！有的还说：我们老早看着就不行，你们偏要堆！领导方面分析失败的原因是：试堆的货垛太多，力量分散，堆码不得法，计算不周密，而这些都是可以改进的。他们继续鼓励积极分子，有重点地在一个仓库中堆一个典型货垛。仓库主任亲自带领了部分干部和警卫同志，量了一个“车单位”面积，把基脚（下层）改为交叉排列，终于试验成功了。个别工人这时还说：“要这么整齐，简直是绣花。”有的干部说：“自己搞可以，工人不肯干也不行。”但多数工人看到了第一个典型垛试验成功，信心已经提高了，他们试堆了第二个典型垛，成绩很好。这时候，有些人还认为：“现在摆摆样子还可以，将来货涌了就不行。”领导方面又引导大家进行了转栈试验。铁的事实最后教育了群众：苏联先进经验，是完全可以仿效、实行的，阻碍我们前进的只是严重的保守思想。
    干部和搬运工人之间，过去是不够团结的，在试行“车单位”面积定额工作的过程中，干部改变了对工人的不正确的看法，明确了依靠工人的思想。实行转栈试验的时候，保管员们用皮尺丈量，又精确计算，算出某单位面积可堆三百八十二包棉花。仓库主任孙景文对工人说：你们也算算可以堆多少！一个工人迈开步子，走了一趟仰着?子一算，答道：三百七十多包。这个数字和干部测量、计算的数字相差不远。干部认识到工人们的经验的确丰富，大家立刻开会，研究了如何依靠工人，主动联系工人的办法。仓库主任领导测定“车单位”面积定额时，亲自和工人们一起研究。棉花进仓多的时候，需要加班，仓库主任给工人生活上很多照顾。工人也明白了一个真理：学习苏联先进经验，可以多堆棉花，为国家节约财产，保证我们将来过美好的生活。为了使垛达到车单位面积定额标准，他们创造了“借脚搭跳”、“搭飞跳”的办法，解决了堆高的技术上的困难。
    第一仓库的仓存量增加了，仓库工作人员工作主动了，大家算了算账，由于仓存量增加了百分之三四点八七，一年可以节省仓租费用七亿三千余万元。从此，翻堆的力资损失和亏耗损失再也没有了。保管员的保管工作已经有了计划性。你问一个保管员，二○四号库房可以堆几个“车单位”，他毫不犹疑地答复：二七点六九个，并告诉你还可以堆进多少“车单位”，合多少包棉花。现在每个货垛一目了然，上面挂着卡片，标明这一堆是几个“车单位”，有多少包。保管员忙乱、劳逸不均的现象也随着纠正了，他们随着新的工作的需要，组织了专责互助组，货物进仓时，大家分工合作，做到有条有理。他们深刻地体会到苏联先进经验的可贵，坚定了改善企业经营管理实行经济核算的决心。
