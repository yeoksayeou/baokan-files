Dear and Dearest Friends:

    Our common and great work has come to an end. Before our departure, we shouted "Long live our beloved leaders!" The train is leaving Beijing Station and heading towards Moscow, but your faces are in our minds, the faces of those who have become closest to us in the past month and a half; in our ears, we still hear the words of love and friendship from millions of mouths; in our hearts, we still feel the great wave of emotions stirred up by meeting your heroic yet humble, hardworking yet talented, great people.

    Yes, our personal visit to your country has come to an end, but our thoughts remain with you. We miss you and talk about you. You have given us infinitely rich material, enough for us to use for a lifetime. Our minds are filled with endless intentions and hopes, and we are willing to express them in our creations. Even if these thoughts cannot immediately become books or films, we are sure that our meeting with your people will sooner or later leave its mark on our creations.

    This meeting inspires wonderful themes, inspires the creation of images, inspires methods of shaping character, and helps people to more vividly discover the social essence of phenomena.

    There will always be a day when thoughts become clear, mature, and recorded on paper.

    Directors and actors will reproduce it, photographers will film it all, and the fire and emotional power that initially came from the hearts of the people will be returned to the people, who will recognize themselves in these thoughts and images.

    That is how the earth evaporates liquid, and the liquid turns into rain and returns to it, nourishing it and giving it life.

    We are leaving you and returning to our dear motherland, to our loved ones, and to our creative work. The distance between us increases minute by minute, but it has no power to separate our friendship.

    Please accept our respects sent to you from the road, please accept our heartfelt thanks for everything you have done for us, and please accept our hope to see you again soon.

    On the way, December 22, 1952

### 苏联电影艺术工作者代表团在归国途中给我国人民的信

专栏：

    苏联电影艺术工作者代表团在归国途中给我国人民的信亲爱的最亲爱的朋友们：
    我们共同底巨大的工作已经结束了。我们临别前高呼我们敬爱的领袖们万岁。火车由北京站出发正向莫斯科驰去，但是在我们的脑际浮现着你们底面孔，浮现着这一个半月以来成了我们最亲近的人底面孔；在我们的耳际还响鸣着千百万张嘴所发出来的爱与友谊的语句；在我们底心里还依然汹涌着沸腾着和你们的英武而又谦逊的、勤劳而又天才的伟大人民会见时所掀起来的情感底巨大的浪潮。
    是的，我们亲身访问你们国家的时间已经结束了，但我们的思想依然和你们在一起。我们怀念着你们，谈论着你们。你们给了我们无限丰富的素材，足够我们使用一生。我们的脑海中充满了无尽的意图和希望，我们愿意在创作中把它们表现出来。即使这思潮不能立刻变成书籍或影片，但是我们确信我们和你们人民的相会迟早是会在我们底创作里面留下印迹的。
    这次的相会给人以美妙主题的启示，给人以创造形象的启发，给人以表现性格底造型方法的启示，帮助人更鲜明地发掘现象底社会本质。
    将来总会有一天，思想明确起来，成熟起来，并纪录在纸上。
    导演与演员们将再现它，摄影师将把这一切都拍到胶片上，而当初来自人民的内心的火与情感的力量将会重新还给人民，而人民也将从这些思想与形象里面再认出自己。
    大地就是这样地蒸发液体，而液体变成雨再还给它，并润泽它，给它以生命。
    我们离开你们回到亲爱的祖国，回到自己的亲人那里，回到自己的创作中去。我们之间的距离一分钟一分钟地增加，但它绝没有力量隔开我们的友谊。
    请接受我们自途中寄给你们的敬意吧，请接受我们热烈的谢意，感谢你们为我们所做的一切吧，请接受我们很快再相见的希望吧。
