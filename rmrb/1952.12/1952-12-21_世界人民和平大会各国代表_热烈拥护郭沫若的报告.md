Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17th (delayed dispatch) The World People's Peace Congress began discussing the cessation of existing wars on the 16th, and the venue was filled with the united will of people from all countries demanding an end to existing wars.

    When the chairman invited Guo Moruo, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation, to the stage to deliver a report on the cessation of existing wars, all the delegates stood up in applause to welcome him. Guo Moruo's report was repeatedly interrupted by the audience's applause. After he finished his report, the audience stood up and applauded again for a long time.

    Following Guo Moruo, Indian National Congress leader Kitchlew, Korean writer Han Xueye, British peace activist Mrs. Felton, American union worker George Hayward and famous lawyer Platts-Mills, and Canadian veteran Dusham who returned from Korea, all expressed their agreement with Guo Moruo's proposal: an immediate ceasefire in Korea and a solution to the prisoner-of-war issue based on the Geneva Conventions. These representatives' speeches were also warmly welcomed by the audience. When Kitchlew said that the Indian people would never be victims of those who wanted to find Asians to fight Asians, the audience applauded enthusiastically. This statement became a powerful answer to the American conspiracy to use Asians to fight Asians.

    世界人民和平大会各国代表
    热烈拥护郭沫若的报告
    【新华社维也纳十七日电】（迟到）世界人民和平大会在十六日开始讨论停止现有战争问题时，会场洋溢着各国人民团结一致要求停止现有战争的意志。
    当主席请中国代表团副团长郭沫若上台就停止现有战争问题作报告时，全体代表都在掌声中起立，表示欢迎。郭沫若在报告中一再被听众的掌声所打断。他报告完毕后，听众又起立鼓掌，历久不息。
    继郭沫若之后发言的印度国大党领袖克其鲁、朝鲜作家韩雪野、英国和平战士费尔顿夫人、美国工会工作者乔治·海华德和著名律师普拉茨—米尔斯、加拿大从朝鲜回去的退伍军人杜沙姆，都一致表示同意郭沫若的主张：立即在朝鲜实行停火，并在日内瓦公约的基础上解决战俘问题。这些代表的发言也受到听众的热烈欢迎。当克其鲁说到印度人民永远不做那些想找亚洲人来和亚洲人作战的人的牺牲者时，听众热烈鼓掌。这种表示成为对美国想用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋的一个有力回答。
