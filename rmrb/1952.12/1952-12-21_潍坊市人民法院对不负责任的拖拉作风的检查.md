    Weifang Municipal People's Court's Self-Criticism of Irresponsible and Dilatory Work Style
    Editor: The criticism published in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters" column on November 23rd, "Weifang Municipal People's Court Should Examine Its Irresponsible and Dilatory Work Style," has greatly helped our judicial reform movement, and we express our deep gratitude. When we accepted the lawsuit from the Shandong Office of the East China Regional Jute United Purchasing Committee for Jute Bags (hereinafter referred to as the Office) requesting the settlement of 20 million yuan owed by "Fangzi Qunxing Commercial Firm," it was also the time when the firm's manager, Lin Ruiwu, was arrested by our court for stealing state assets. Lin Ruiwu owed a lot of public and private debts, which were difficult to handle individually; and it was also inappropriate to ask the guarantor of one of his debts to repay the debt on his behalf before deciding how to handle Lin Ruiwu's assets. Therefore, after research, our court decided that the issue of these 20 million yuan should also be handled together with Lin Ruiwu's other issues. Later, we further learned that the circumstances of Lin Ruiwu's theft of state assets were relatively complicated, the amount of theft was large, and his ability to repay was insufficient. Moreover, such cases were handled uniformly by the Weifang Municipal Thrift and Inspection Committee, so our court could not handle the issue of these 20 million yuan separately. During this period, the Office did send written requests or people to urge us many times, but we did not patiently explain the above situation clearly, but instead dealt with them with an irresponsible and dilatory attitude. At the same time, we did not pay enough attention to the requirements of the Office, and we simply waited with reasons such as "the higher authorities have not approved it" or "waiting for unified handling," without taking a proactive attitude to resolve the issue more quickly. This is a manifestation of our bureaucratic work style, and we will correct it in this judicial reform movement.

### 潍坊市人民法院对不负责任的拖拉作风的检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    潍坊市人民法院对不负责任的拖拉作风的检查
    编辑同志：十一月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的“潍坊市人民法院应检查不负责任的拖拉作风”的批评，对我们进行司法改革运动有很大的帮助，我们深深表示感谢。当我们接受华东区麻袋用麻联购委员会联购处山东办事处（以下简称办事处）诉请解决“坊子群兴商行”偿还欠款二千万元的问题时，也正是该行经理林瑞五因盗窃国家资财被我院逮捕的时候。林瑞五所欠公私债款很多，难于一一单独处理；并且在林瑞五的财产未决定如何处理前，叫他的某一债务的保人代他偿还债款也不适当。所以我院经研究后决定，这二千万元的问题也待和林瑞五的其他问题一并处理。后来，我们更了解到林瑞五盗窃国家资财的情况比较复杂，盗窃数字大，偿还能力已不足，而这样的案件又是由潍坊市节约检查委员会统一掌握处理，所以这二千万元的问题，我院更不能单独处理。这当中，该办事处确曾书面或派人向我处催过好多次，但我们没有耐心地把上述情况交代清楚，而是以不负责任的拖拉态度应付。同时，对于该办事处的要求，我们也表现得不够重视，只是以“上级未批下来”或“等待一并处理”等为理由，而等待着，没有采取积极的态度，使问题能较迅速地解决。这是我们的官僚主义作风的表现，我们当在这次司法改革运动中纠正。
