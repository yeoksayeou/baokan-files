Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace issued a statement protesting the US aggressors' massacre of POWs in Beehive Island. The text is as follows:

    The bloody atrocities committed by the US aggressors in Korea against captured Chinese and Korean personnel have long aroused unanimous condemnation and serious protests from peace-loving people around the world. After committing crimes of mass slaughter of Chinese and Korean POWs in POW camps such as Geoje Island and Jeju Island, the US aggressors recently created another bloody massacre in the Beehive Island POW camp, killing more than two hundred of our captured personnel. This bestial behavior of the US aggressors has aroused unparalleled anger among the Chinese people, and all of our people unanimously lodge a solemn protest with the US aggressors.

    The slaughter committed by the US aggressors on Beehive Island completely exposes the true face of the illegal resolution recently passed by the United Nations General Assembly, with the US's so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" at its core. The reason why the US aggressors dare to escalate and more extensively and cruelly abuse and kill our captured personnel is that the US aggressors have the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly as an excuse for their forced detention of POWs and barbaric massacres. All those who support the US's policy of aggression must bear the responsibility they should bear for this heinous crime committed by the US aggressors.

    However, the US aggressors cannot achieve their conspiracy of forcibly detaining POWs through their bloody and terroristic behavior, nor can they subdue and frustrate the heroic and tenacious resistance will of our captured personnel, who have waged a resolute struggle against the US aggressors with a spirit of fearlessness for justice and freedom, and to return to the motherland. We fully support the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean captured personnel to win the right to return home and live a peaceful life, and resolutely advocate an immediate end to the war in Korea, and the US aggressors must immediately stop their shameful atrocities and repatriate all POWs in accordance with the Geneva Convention.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The news that the US imperialists had again carried out a large-scale massacre of our POWs on Beehive Island aroused boundless anger among the Chinese people. The Chinese Red Cross Society, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the China People's Relief Administration, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children successively issued statements lodging serious protests against this bloody massacre by the US side.

    The Chinese Red Cross Society stated in its statement: "The Seventh UN General Assembly just passed an illegal resolution on the Korean issue under the manipulation of the US government, and the US military has again collectively slaughtered 87 of our captured personnel on Beehive Island. The Beehive Island massacre has more realistically and powerfully demonstrated the essence of the so-called 'voluntary repatriation' or 'non-forcible repatriation' principle of US imperialism and its accomplice countries. We Chinese Red Cross workers have a moral responsibility to uphold the dignity of the Geneva Convention and the principles of humanitarianism. We absolutely cannot tolerate such cruel and inhumane atrocities. We call on all upright and kind people around the world to take immediate action to stop the US's atrocities of massacring POWs and severely punish the masterminds of the incident."

    The spokesperson of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs stated: "We protest with extreme indignation the bloody atrocities of the US bandits in the Beehive Island POW camp. This unprecedented heinous crime is a challenge to the basic human nature shared by mankind." The spokesperson continued, "The Beehive Island incident is a direct result of this illegal resolution of the United Nations. It is this illegal resolution that makes the US aggressors dare to forcibly detain POWs with more brutal and bloody slaughter, attempting to transfer them to the Chiang and Li bandit gangs to implement Eisenhower's conspiracy of 'using Asians to fight Asians.'" The spokesperson said, "Our captured personnel on Beehive Island have shown the world their determination to refuse forced detention and demand repatriation with their earth-shattering heroic actions of unyielding to the death. The Chinese and Korean people, as well as the peace-loving people of all Asia and the world, will support this just struggle of our captured personnel with their actions."

    The statement of the China People's Relief Administration said: "This bloody case occurred after the notorious Harriman, who insisted on forcibly detaining POWs, came to South Korea with a secret mission related to the POW issue. There is no doubt that this is another proof of the US imperialists' crime of forcing POWs to serve as cannon fodder, and this is a direct result of the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean issue. We - the relief and welfare workers of China, express our boundless anger at the new crime of the US imperialists in massacring POWs on Beehive Island."

    The statement of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation said: "The captured personnel on Beehive Island are all flesh and blood of mothers in China and Korea, and we Chinese women cannot but express our boundless anger and serious protest once again at the aggressors' inhuman atrocities! We firmly support the just struggle of our captured personnel and appeal to all women with a sense of justice around the world to unite and condemn this shameless crime of the US aggressors."

    The spokesperson of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children said in a statement: "We appeal to all kind parents around the world who nurture human life, let us unite closely to strive for an immediate end to the Korean War and save children from the disaster of war."

    抗议美方在蜂岩岛大批屠杀战俘
    中国红十字会总会等团体亦提出严重抗议
    【新华社二十日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发表声明抗议美国侵略者在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘。文如下：
    美国侵略者在朝鲜屠杀中朝被俘人员的血腥暴行，早已激起了全世界爱好和平的人民的一致谴责与严重抗议。美国侵略者在继巨济岛、济州岛等战俘营大量屠杀中朝战俘的罪行之后，最近又在蜂岩岛战俘营制造了大规模杀伤我方被俘人员二百余人的大血案。美国侵略者的这种野兽行为，激起了中国人民无比的愤怒，我们全体人民一致向美国侵略者提出严正的抗议。
    美国侵略者在蜂岩岛上所进行的屠杀罪行，完全暴露了最近联合国大会所通过的、以美国的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”为其中心内容的非法决议案的真实面目。美国侵略者之所以敢于变本加厉地、更大规模、更残酷地虐杀我方被俘人员，就是由于美国侵略者有了联合国大会通过的非法决议作为其进行强迫扣留战俘与进行野蛮大屠杀的藉口。对于美国侵略者所犯的此种滔天罪恶，一切支持美国侵略政策者都要负起其应负的责任。
    可是，美国侵略者是无法以其血腥恐怖的行为来实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，无法屈服与挫折我方被俘人员英勇顽强的抗拒意志的，他们为正义与自由、为重返祖国，以大无畏精神对美国侵略者进行了坚决的斗争。我们全力支持中朝被俘人员为争取回家过和平生活的权利的正义斗争，坚决主张立即停止在朝鲜的战争，美国侵略者必须迅速停止它的可耻暴行，并遵照日内瓦公约全部遣返战俘。

    一九五二年十二月二十日
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义者又在蜂岩岛大肆屠杀我方战俘的消息传到北京后，引起中国人民的无比愤怒。中国红十字会总会、中国人民外交学会、中国人民救济总会、中华全国民主妇女联合会和中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会相继发表声明，对美方这一血腥屠杀事件提出严重抗议。
    中国红十字会总会在声明中说：“第七届联合国大会刚刚在美国政府的操纵下通过了关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，美国军队便又在蜂岩岛集体屠杀我方被俘人员达八十七名。蜂岩岛的大屠杀事件，已更加现实有力地说明了美帝国主义及其帮凶国家的所谓‘自愿遣返’或‘不强迫遣返’原则的实质。我们中国红十字工作者有道义的责任来维护日内瓦公约的尊严和人道主义的原则。我们绝不能容忍这种残酷的非人道的暴行。我们呼吁全世界一切正直良善的人们立即行动起来，以实际的行动制止美国残杀战俘的暴行，严惩事件的主谋者。”
    中国人民外交学会发言人的声明说：“我们以极端愤慨的心情抗议美国强盗在蜂岩岛战俘营的血腥暴行。这种史无前例的滔天罪行是对于人类所共有的基本人道本性的一个挑战。”发言人继称：“蜂岩岛事件是这次联合国的非法决议案的直接结果。正是这个非法决议案使得美国侵略者敢于如此大胆地以更加残暴的血腥屠杀手段，来强迫扣留战俘，企图把他们移交给蒋、李匪帮，实行艾森豪威尔的‘用亚洲人打亚洲人’的阴谋。”发言人说：“在蜂岩岛的我方被俘人员已经用他们的至死不屈的惊天动地的英勇行动，向全世界表明了他们拒绝接受强迫扣留并要求遣返的决心。中朝人民以及全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民，都将以自己的行动来支持我方被俘人员的这种正义斗争。”
    中国人民救济总会的声明说：“这一血案是在坚持强迫扣留战俘而臭名昭彰的哈利逊负有与战俘问题有关的秘密使命来到南朝鲜后发生的。毫无疑问，这是美帝国主义强迫战俘当炮灰的罪行的再一次证明，这是联合国大会通过关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案的直接结果。我们——中国的救济福利工作者，对美帝国主义者在蜂岩岛虐杀战俘的新罪行，表示无比的愤怒。”
    中华全国民主妇女联合会的声明说：“蜂岩岛上的被俘人员，都是中朝两国母亲的亲骨肉，我们中国妇女不能不对侵略者这种惨无人道的暴行，再一次表示我们无比的愤怒和严重的抗议！我们坚决支持我方被俘人员的正义斗争，并吁请全世界有正义感的妇女一致起来，对美国侵略者的这种无耻罪行加以声讨。”
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会发言人在声明中说：“我们向全世界一切孕育人类生命的善良父母们呼吁，让我们紧密地团结起来，争取立即停止朝鲜战争，挽救儿童免于战争的灾难。”
