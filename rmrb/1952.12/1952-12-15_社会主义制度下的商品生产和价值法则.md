    Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is a model of the creative development of Marxism-Leninism. This work is of world historical significance. In this work, the laws of social production and the laws of distribution of material resources in socialist society are comprehensively studied, and the road for the gradual transition from socialism to communism is determined.
    Comrade Stalin's profound scientific study of the issue of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is a new and outstanding contribution to Marxist political economy.

I

    In his work, Comrade Stalin pointed out the great importance of correctly solving the commodity production issue for the victory of socialism.
    Commodity production has existed for thousands of years. It arose on the basis of the social division of labor and the emergence of private ownership of the means of production.
    Lenin said: "Commodity production is a system of social relations in which many individual producers create all kinds of products (social division of labor), and all these products become equal to each other in exchange." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 21, page 43, Russian edition)
    Commodity production existing in various societies is not something independent of the surrounding economic conditions. On the contrary, its nature is completely determined by the ruling mode of production.
    Comrade Stalin instructed that commodity production should not be regarded as the same as capitalist production. Commodity production is older than capitalist production. Commodity production existed under the slave system and served the slave system. It existed under the feudal system and served the feudal system. However, although it prepared certain conditions for capitalist production, it did not lead to capitalism. Only when there is private ownership of the means of production, only when labor appears as a commodity on the market, and only when capitalists can buy it and exploit it in the production process, will commodity production lead to capitalism.
    As a result of the victory of our socialist revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, capitalist ownership of the means of production—factories, land, railways—was eliminated, and public, socialist ownership was established. At the same time, after the victory of the proletarian revolution, during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, there were still many small and medium producers—peasants—who could not be expropriated. The task of the Party is to attract them to the side of the proletariat and create conditions for the gradual transition from small commodity production to a large-scale, socialist economy. Therefore, the Party and the Soviet state preserved commodity production in the country, although the conditions for the existence of commodity production have fundamentally changed.
    Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party exposed and abandoned the capitulationist proposals of those poor Marxists who believed that the working class should not seize power until capitalism had bankrupted all the peasants and concentrated the means of production in agriculture. These proposals represented abandoning the struggle for the victory of the proletarian revolution.
    Lenin and Stalin also crushed and abandoned the harmful policies of other poor Marxists who proposed that the working class, having seized power, should begin to expropriate the small and medium producers in the countryside and socialize their means of production. Marxists cannot take this absurd and criminal path, because such a path would destroy the possibility of the victory of the socialist revolution and throw the peasants into the camp of the enemies of the proletariat for a long time.
    The only correct path is to gradually and voluntarily unite the small and medium producers into production cooperatives, that is, into large-scale agricultural enterprises, collective farms; and with the help of the developing state industry, establish a modern technical foundation for the collective farms. In order to establish the economic combination of city and countryside, industry and agriculture, it is necessary to maintain commodity production
    (exchange through buying and selling) as the only form of economic connection with the city acceptable to the peasants, and to fully develop Soviet trade, that is, state-owned trade and cooperative-collective farm trade, and to expel all capitalists from commodity circulation. The history of socialist construction in the Soviet Union has proved that the path planned by Lenin and Stalin is completely correct. This path is the only possible and appropriate path for socialism to achieve victory.
    Comrade Stalin taught that after the victory of socialism, the necessity of commodity production has not disappeared.
    In the Soviet Union, there are two basic forms of socialist production: the state-owned, all-people's form and the collective farm form. In state-owned enterprises, the means of production and products are the property of the whole people. However, in the current 97,000 collective farms in our country, although the means of production (land, machinery) also belong to the state, the products are the property of individual collective farms.
    The state can only dispose of the products of state-owned enterprises, while only the collective farms can dispose of the products of the collective farms as their own property. However, the collective farms are only willing to transfer their products in the form of commodities, and are willing to exchange them for the commodities they need. The sale of collective farm products is carried out through buying and selling. Stalin instructed that commodity production and commodity circulation are necessary in our country, just as they were about thirty years ago when Lenin announced that commodity circulation must be expanded with all efforts.
    As long as there are still two basic production sectors—the state-owned and the collective farm sectors—commodity production and commodity circulation should still be preserved as necessary and extremely useful factors in our national economic system.
    Under socialism, commodity production is fundamentally different from commodity production under capitalism.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "...Commodity production in our country is not ordinary commodity production, but a special kind of commodity production, commodity production without capitalists, which is basically related to the united socialist producers (the state, collective farms, cooperatives). Its scope of activity is limited to personal consumer goods. Obviously, it can never develop into capitalist production, and it is destined to serve the cause of developing and consolidating socialist production together with its 'monetary economy'."
    The public ownership of the means of production, the elimination of the wage labor system and the exploitation system, and the planned development of the national economy—all these strictly limit the scope of commodity production under socialism. One of the most important characteristics of commodity production under socialism is that the united socialist producers: the state, collective farms, and cooperatives, replace the separate private commodity production.
    Unlike capitalism, commodity production under socialism is not all-encompassing. Under our socialist conditions, land has been removed from the scope of commodity circulation; land is no longer an object of buying and selling, and labor is not a commodity either. In addition to land, other means of production produced by state-owned enterprises are also not commodities. As Comrade Stalin pointed out, a commodity is a product that can be sold to any buyer. After the commodity is sold, the commodity owner loses all ownership of the commodity. Our means of production are not sold, but are distributed by the state to its own enterprises, while the state fully retains ownership of them. Means of production only retain the characteristics of commodities in the field of foreign trade, where they are indeed sold.
    Means of production are no longer commodities in the field of domestic economic circulation, but they still maintain the shell of commodities. Comrade Stalin pointed out that under socialism, economic development is not carried out in a revolutionary way, but in a gradual way. The old is not simply abolished, but changes its nature to adapt to the new, only maintaining its form; as for the new, it does not simply eliminate the old, but permeates the old, changes the nature and function of the old, and does not destroy its form, but uses its form to develop the new. This is true not only for commodities, but also for currency and banks, which lose their old functions and acquire new functions, while maintaining their old forms and being used by the socialist system.
    In socialist society, the scope of commodity production is limited to personal consumer goods. Under socialist conditions, the products produced by cooperative-collective farms are commodities, which become social consumer goods through trade, because their owners change when they are sold. The consumer goods produced by state-owned socialist enterprises are also commodities, which reach the residents through the state-owned and cooperative trade systems. Since commodity production under socialism is fundamentally different from commodity production under capitalism, the commodities themselves under socialist conditions do not contain the contradictions inherent in commodities under capitalism.
    In the socialist economy, the scope of commodity production is strictly limited, and its nature has changed. Therefore, the nature of commodity circulation has also changed. Comrade Stalin had already pointed out in 1933 when explaining the characteristics of Soviet commerce that Soviet commerce is a special kind of commerce, which has never existed in history and is only implemented under the conditions of Soviet society.
    The basic principled difference of Soviet commerce lies in the fact that it is a commerce without big or small capitalists, and a commerce without big or small speculators.
    The fundamental characteristics of commodity production under socialism are the public ownership of the means of production, the absence of an exploitation system, and the planned development of the national economy. Commodity production under socialism has no antagonistic contradictions; it cannot develop into capitalist production, and it serves the development and consolidation of socialism.

II

    The question of the law of value under the socialist system, as explored by Comrade Stalin, has significant theoretical and practical significance.
    The law of value only comes into play where there is commodity production. The requirement of this law is that the exchange of commodities must be carried out according to the socially necessary labor contained in the commodities. Marx pointed out: "As value, all commodities are only a certain amount of solidified labor time."
    The law of value, like other economic laws, is an objective economic law that exists and operates independently of people's will. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the law of value operates in a "reformed" form under the socialist system. Economic laws cannot be "reformed" because their emergence and operation are independent of people's will and consciousness.
    Stalin taught that people can recognize objective laws, guide the destructive effects of certain laws in another direction, limit the scope of their operation, and use them for the benefit of society. The Communist Party and the Soviet state, recognizing the role of the law of value, use it to benefit the development of the socialist economy. Under socialism, completely different from capitalism, the operation of the law of value does not have spontaneity and destructiveness.
    Under capitalism, the means of production are privately owned, and competition and anarchy of production dominate society. The law of value is the regulator of production. On the basis of this law, through the mechanism of price fluctuations in competition, the spontaneous distribution of social labor and capital between various enterprises and various economic sectors occurs. The law of value under capitalism leads to periodic crises of reproduction and the destruction of productive forces.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that under socialism, the law of value cannot be and is not the regulator of production. Here, the scope of operation of the law of value is strictly limited within a certain range. There is no private ownership of the means of production. The public ownership of the means of production in urban and rural areas, the law of planned (proportional) development, the various annual plans and five-year plans, and our economic policies—all these strictly limit the scope of operation of the law of value.
    The operation of the law of value is subordinate to the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned development of the national economy.
    As mentioned earlier, commodity production under socialism is limited to the scope of the production of consumer goods. This determines the scope of operation of the law of value.
    Comrade Stalin wrote: "In our country, the scope of operation of the law of value primarily includes commodity circulation, including the exchange of commodities through buying and selling, including the exchange of commodities mainly for personal consumption. Here, in this field, the law of value certainly maintains a regulating role within a certain scope."
    Under socialism, the law of value operates through money and prices, because price is the monetary expression of the value of a commodity. The requirement of this law is that the price of a commodity is based on the socially necessary labor spent in manufacturing these commodities.
    When the Soviet state plans and regulates the prices of commodities, it takes the law of value into consideration. For example, it is well known that the labor spent in producing one quintal of cotton is several times more than the labor spent in producing one quintal of grain. Therefore, the price of one quintal of cotton should be much higher than the price of one quintal of grain.
    However, some economic workers and planning workers proposed to set the same price for grain and cotton. Comrade Stalin asked: "If the suggestions of these comrades were given legal effect, what would be the result? Then we would bankrupt the cotton growers, and there would be no cotton."
    The law of value affects the exchange of commodities for personal consumption. At a certain level of monetary income of the laborers, the quantity of consumer goods they can obtain depends on the level of the prices of these commodities. However, this influence of the law of value does not have spontaneity due to the conditions of the socialist economy. In the socialist economy, the scope and composition of commodity turnover in state-owned and cooperative trade are determined by the plan. Both the monetary income of the residents and the prices of goods are regulated according to the plan. Comrade Stalin already instructed in 1929:
    "In our market, there is no phenomenon of free manipulation of prices as is common in capitalist countries. Grain prices are basically regulated by us. Industrial product prices are regulated by us. We strive to implement a policy of reducing cost and reducing industrial product prices, while striving to maintain the stability of agricultural product prices. Isn't it very clear that such a special and particular order in the market, which is fundamentally absent in capitalist countries?" (Stalin's Complete Works, Volume 12, pages 43-44, Russian edition)
    When regulating the prices of consumer goods, the Soviet state takes the law of value into consideration and proceeds from the basic economic law of socialism. The main characteristics and requirements of this basic economic law are to guarantee the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of constantly increasing and improving socialist production on the basis of advanced technology. The consistently implemented policy of step-by-step reduction of state retail prices of consumer goods raises the level of people's consumption. Due to the five price reductions in the post-war period, it is now possible to purchase with fifty rubles what could be purchased with one hundred rubles at the end of 1947.
    The operation of the law of value, as Comrade Stalin indicated, is not limited to the scope of commodity circulation, but also extends to the production aspect. The law of value does not have a regulating role in our socialist production, but it still affects production.
    The problem is that the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the labor consumed in the production process are produced and sold in our country as commodities subject to the law of value. It is precisely here that the influence of the law of value on production can be seen. Therefore, in socialist enterprises, such issues as economic accounting and profit issues, cost issues, and price issues have practical significance.
    The amount of labor consumed in the production of products is calculated under socialism by means of value and its forms. Therefore, our enterprises cannot and should not fail to take the law of value into consideration. Value calculation in the hands of the socialist state is a tool for supervising the amount of labor and the amount of consumption.
    In socialist enterprises, value calculation is necessary for valuation, for accounting, for determining the income and losses of enterprises, and for financial organs to supervise the implementation of economic plans in rubles. The Soviet state uses the law of value in the struggle to strive for a system of economy, profit, and expansion of socialist accumulation.
    Under socialism, from the perspective of the entire national economy, guaranteeing enduring and solid forms of advanced profitability is provided by the operation and planning of the law of planned development of the national economy, because they enable our country to avoid periodic economic crises and ensure the continuous growth of the national economy at a high speed.
    At the current stage of development, in order to correctly lead production, our economic workers must study the law of value and master it.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "The problem is not that the law of value affects our production. The problem is that our economic workers and planning workers, with a few exceptions, know very little about the role played by the law of value, do not study this role, and are not good at considering this role in their calculations."
    The instructions of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan charged economic cadres in all large and small economic construction posts to practice a system of strict economy and increase the profitability of enterprises. The task of economic workers is to find, discover, and utilize the potential hidden in production, maximize the use of existing production capacity, systematically improve production methods, reduce product costs, and implement economic accounting systems.
    The Communist Party and the Soviet government, recognizing economic laws, consciously guide the development of the socialist economy, making this development beneficial to our country's further prosperity and to the continuous improvement of the people's welfare.

III

    Just like the law of value, value is a historical category associated with the existence of commodity production. Once commodity production disappears, value, along with its various forms and the law of value, will also disappear along with it.
    Of course, commodity circulation and collective farm ownership are currently being effectively used to develop the socialist economy, and they are also bringing undoubted benefits to our society. It will also bring benefits in the near future. But attention must be paid to the prospects for our development.
    Comrade Stalin instructed that it would be unpardonable blindness if one could not see that these phenomena have now begun to hinder the powerful development of our productive forces, because they are hindering the complete inclusion of the entire national economy, especially agriculture, by state planning.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that commodity production and the law of value resulting from it are incompatible with the advanced stage of communism, and thereby dealt a fatal blow to the anti-Marxist concept of regarding the law of value as a phenomenon outside of history and as the regulator of labor distribution between various production sectors in all historical periods.
    The upsurge of productive forces in socialist society will necessarily require the establishment of a form of ownership by the whole people within the scope of the entire national economy. When there appears an all-encompassing production sector, namely, the state-owned sector and the collective farm sector, which has the right to dispose of all consumer goods in the country, the production and circulation of commodities will disappear as unnecessary factors in the national economy.
    At the advanced stage of communist society, the amount of labor used to produce products will not be calculated in a roundabout way, not by means of value and its various forms, but directly by the amount of time and hours spent in producing products. Comrade Stalin instructed that this will be a society where production will be regulated by social needs, and calculating social needs will be of paramount importance to the planning organs.
    Among the basic prerequisites for preparing for the transition to communism, Comrade Stalin instructed that it is necessary to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people by means of gradual transition that is conducive to the collective farms, and also to replace commodity circulation with a product exchange system between state industry and collective farms by means of gradual transition, so that the central government or some other socio-economic center can control all the products of social production for the benefit of society.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "In order to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, it is necessary to exclude the surplus products of collective farm production from the commodity circulation system and include them in the product exchange system between state industry and collective farms."
    In his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Stalin raised the issue of the practical task of product exchange, which should be solved by the Communist Party in the era of gradual transition from socialism to communism.
    In our country, the socialist relations of production—the main and decisive force for the powerful development of social productive forces—are being consolidated. The development of production and the perfection of production create the necessary conditions for changing the sales form of collective farm products, for gradually reducing commodity circulation and replacing it with a product exchange system.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out the sprouts of a product exchange system in the form of agricultural product "barter" in the current procurement system for certain agricultural products.
    So how is "barter" realized? When ordering technical crops—cotton, flax, sugar beets, and other crops, collective farms supply agricultural raw materials to the state, not only obtaining currency from the government, but also mainly obtaining necessary manufactured goods with significantly lower prices than general retail goods.
    At the 19th Party Congress, clear examples can be cited to illustrate that the existence of product exchange promotes the economic consolidation of collective farms and the rise of the material happiness of collective farm members. Collective farms that have such contracts with the state will obtain more benefits than collective farms that do not have such contracts. The existing sprouts of product exchange will develop into a broad product exchange system.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that the product exchange system requires a large increase in the products sent from cities to rural areas. Therefore, there is no need to be particularly hasty in implementing this system, and it should depend on the degree of accumulation of manufactured goods in cities. But we should move forward without hesitation, reducing the scope of commodity circulation and expanding the scope of product exchange. The implementation of product exchange makes the transition from socialism to communism easier and makes it possible to include the basic property of collective farms and the products of collective farm production into the overall system of national planning.
    Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" arms our cadres with knowledge of the laws of social development, enabling us to foresee the course of events and teaching us to recognize and utilize economic laws that are conducive to the victorious construction of communism.

    社会主义制度下的商品生产和价值法则
    苏联  马卡罗娃
    斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是创造性发展马克思—列宁主义的典范。这一著作具有全世界的历史性意义。在这个著作中，全面地研究了社会主义社会中的社会生产法则和物质资料的分配法则，确定了由社会主义逐渐向共产主义过渡的道路。
    斯大林同志在其著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中对社会主义制度下商品生产和价值法则问题所做的深刻的科学研究，是马克思主义政治经济学中的新的卓越贡献。一
    斯大林同志在自己的著作中，指出正确解决商品生产问题对社会主义胜利的巨大重要性。
    商品生产已存在了几千年了。它产生在劳动的社会分工和生产资料私有制出现的基础上。
    列宁说过：“商品生产是一种社会关系体系，在这体系之下，许多个别的生产者创造着各色各样的生产品（劳动的社会分工），而所有这些生产品在交换时彼此相等起来。”（列宁全集第二十一卷，第四十三页，俄文版）
    在各个不同的社会中所存在的商品生产，不是一种什么不依赖周围经济条件而独立自在的东西，相反地，它的性质完全决定于统治着的生产方式。
    斯大林同志指示说，不能把商品生产和资本主义生产看成一样。商品生产比资本主义生产更老些。商品生产在奴隶制度下就存在过并且替奴隶制度服务过。它在封建主义制度下就存在过，并且替封建制度服务过，可是，虽然它为资本主义生产准备了若干条件，却没有引导到资本主义。只有存在着生产资料的私有制，只有劳动力作为商品出现在市场上，资本家能够购买它并在生产过程中剥削它，商品生产才会引导到资本主义。
    由于我国社会主义革命的胜利和建立无产阶级专政的结果，消灭了对生产资料——工厂、土地、铁路——的资本主义所有制，并建立了公有的、社会主义的所有制。同时，在无产阶级革命胜利后，在由资本主义向社会主义的过渡时期，还有许多中小生产者阶级——农民，这些农民是不能剥夺的。党的任务是吸引他们到无产阶级这方面来，并为由小商品生产逐渐过渡到大的、社会主义的经济道路创造条件。因此，党和苏维埃国家在国内保存了商品生产，虽然商品生产存在的条件已根本上改变了。
    共产党在列宁和斯大林的领导下，揭穿了和抛弃了那些可怜的马克思主义者的投降的建议，他们认为当资本主义还没有使全体农民破产，还没有把农业中的生产资料集中起来的时候，工人阶级不应该夺取政权。这些建议表示放弃争取无产阶级革命胜利的斗争。
    列宁和斯大林也粉碎了和抛弃了其他可怜的马克思主义者的有害方针，他们提议掌握了政权的工人阶级要着手剥夺农村中的中小生产者，并把他们的生产资料公有化。马克思主义者是不能走这条荒谬和犯罪的道路的，因为这样的道路就会摧毁社会主义革命胜利的可能性，就会把农民长久地抛掷到无产阶级敌人的阵营中。
    唯一正确的道路是使中小生产者逐渐地和自愿地联合到生产合作社中，即联合到大规模的农业企业、集体农庄中；在发展着的国家工业的援助下，为集体农庄建立现代的技术基础。为了确立城市和乡村、工业和农业的经济结合，必须保持商品生产
    （通过买卖的交换）这个为农民唯一可以接受的与城市进行经济联系的形式，并且要以全力展开苏维埃贸易，即国营贸易和合作社——集体农庄贸易，把所有一切资本家从商品流通中排挤出去。苏联社会主义建设的历史，证明了为列宁和斯大林所策划的这条道路，是完全正确的。这条道路是使社会主义获得胜利的唯一可能的和适当的道路。
    斯大林同志教导说，在社会主义胜利之后，商品生产的必需性也没有消失。
    在苏联，存在着社会主义生产的两种基本形式：国家的全民的形式和集体农庄的形式。在国家企业中，生产资料和产品是全民的财产。而在目前我国所有的九万七千个集体农庄中，虽然生产资料（土地、机器）也属于国家，可是产品却是个别集体农庄的财产。
    国家只能支配国家企业的产品，至于集体农庄的产品，只有集体农庄才能作为自己的财产来支配。然而，集体农庄只愿以商品的形式把自己的产品转让出来，愿意以这种商品换得它们所需要的商品。集体农庄产品的销售是通过买卖的办法进行的。斯大林指示说，商品生产和商品流通，目前在我国，也像大约三十年以前当列宁宣布必须以全力扩展商品流通时一样，乃是必要的东西。
    只要还存在着两种基本生产部门——国家的和集体农场部门的时候，商品生产和商品流通便应当作为我国国民经济体系中必要的和极其有用的因素而仍然保存着。
    在社会主义的条件下，商品生产是和资本主义制度下的商品生产有着根本的区别。
    斯大林同志指示说：“……我国的商品生产并不是通常的商品生产，而是特种的商品生产，是没有资本家参加的商品生产，这种商品生产基本上是与联合的社会主义生产者（国家、集体农庄、合作社）的商品有关的。它的活动范围只限于个人消费品。显然，它决不能发展为资本主义生产，而且它注定了要和它的‘货币经济’一起共同为发展和巩固社会主义生产的事业服务。”
    生产资料的公有制，消灭了雇佣劳动制度和剥削制度，国民经济有计划的发展——这一切都严格地限制着社会主义制度下商品生产的范围。在社会主义制度下，商品生产的最重要特征之一，是联合的社会主义生产者：国家、集体农庄、合作社代替了单独的私人的商品生产。
    社会主义制度下的商品生产与资本主义不同，它不是包罗一切的。在我们社会主义的条件下，商品流通的范围中已除去了土地，土地已不是买卖的对象了，劳动力也不是商品。除去土地以外，国有企业所生产的其他生产资料也不是商品。如斯大林同志所指示的，商品是这样的一种产品，它可以出售给任何买主。在商品出售之后，商品所有者便失去对商品的所有权。我国的生产资料并不出售，而是由国家分配给自己的企业，同时国家完全保有对它们的所有权。生产资料仅仅在对外贸易的领域内才保存着商品的特性，它们才确实被出售。
    生产资料在国内经济流通领域内已不是商品，但是它们还保持着商品的外壳。斯大林同志指出，在社会主义制度下，经济发展并不是以变革的方式，而是以逐渐改变的方式进行的，旧的东西并不是简单地被废除干净，而是把自己的本性改变得与新的东西相适应，仅仅保持着自己的形式；至于新的东西也不是简单地消灭旧的东西，而是渗到旧的东西里面去，改变旧东西的本性和机能，并不破坏它的形式，而是利用它的形式来发展新的东西。不仅商品是这样，而且货币、银行也是这样，它们失去自己旧的机能并取得了新的机能，同时保持着旧的形式而为社会主义制度所利用。
    在社会主义社会中，商品生产的范围只限于个人消费品。在社会主义条件下，合作社—集体农庄生产的产品是商品，它通过贸易成为社会消费品，因为在出售时其所有者变化了。国营社会主义企业所生产的消费品也是商品，它通过国营和合作社贸易系统到达居民手中。由于社会主义制度下的商品生产与资本主义制度下的商品生产根本不同，所以社会主义条件下的商品本身不含有在资本主义条件下商品所固有的矛盾。
    在社会主义经济中，商品生产的范围受到严格的限制，它的性质已经改变了。因之商品流通的性质也改变了。斯大林同志还在一九三三年当说明苏维埃商业的特性时，即曾指示过，苏维埃的商业是特种商业，这是历史上从来没有过，只有在苏维埃社会条件下加以实行的商业。
    苏维埃商业的基本的原则上的不同地方，在于这是没有大小资本家参加的商业，没有大小投机商人参加的商业。
    在社会主义条件下，商品生产的根本特性，就是生产资料的公有制，没有剥削制度和国民经济有计划的发展。社会主义制度下的商品生产没有对抗性的矛盾，它不能发展到资本主义的生产，它为社会主义的发展和巩固而服务。二
    为斯大林同志所探讨的关于社会主义制度下价值法则的问题，具有重大的理论和实践的意义。
    价值法则只在有商品生产的地方才发生作用。这一法则的要求是商品的交换要按照商品中所包含的社会必需劳动来进行。马克思指出说：“当做价值来看，一切商品都只是凝固的劳动时间的一定量。”
    价值法则，也像其他的经济法则一样，是不以人们的意志为转移而存在和发生作用的一个客观经济法则。因此，如果说价值法则在社会主义制度下是在“改造过的”形式中发生着作用，是不正确的。经济法则是不能“改造”的，因为它们的产生和发生作用是不以人们的意志和意识为转移的。
    斯大林教导说，人们能够认识客观的法则，把某些法则所发生的破坏作用引导到另一方向，限制它们发生作用的范围，利用它们为社会谋福利。共产党和苏维埃国家，认识了价值法则的作用，利用它来为社会主义经济的发展谋利。在社会主义制度下与资本主义完全不同，价值法则的作用没有自发性和破坏性。
    在资本主义的条件下，生产资料是私人所有制，竞争和生产的无政府状态在社会中占统治地位，价值法则是生产的调节者。在这个法则的基础上，通过竞争中的价格涨落的机构，发生各种企业和各经济部门之间社会劳动和资本的自发分配情况。资本主义制度下的价值法则，导致再生产的周期性危机，导致生产力的破坏。
    斯大林同志指出，在社会主义制度下，价值法则不能是同时也不可能是生产的调节者。这里，价值法则发生作用的范围是严格地限制在一定范围内的。没有生产资料的私有制。城市和乡村的生产资料的公有化，有计划的（按比例的）发展的法则，各个年度计划和五年计划以及我们的经济政策——这一切都严格地限制着价值法则发生作用的范围。
    价值法则的作用，是从属于社会主义的基本经济法则和国民经济有计划发展的法则的。
    如前面所指出的，社会主义制度下的商品生产，是被限制在消费资料的生产范围内的。这便决定着价值法则发生作用的范围。
    斯大林同志写道：“在我国，价值法则发生作用的范围，首先是包括商品流通，包括通过买卖的商品交换，包括主要是个人消费的商品的交换。在这里，在这个领域中，价值法则当然是在一定范围内保持着调节者的作用的。”
    在社会主义条件下，价值法则通过货币和价格发生作用，因为价格是商品价值的货币表现。这个法则的要求，在于商品的价格基于制造这些商品时所花费的社会必需劳动。
    苏维埃国家在有计划地规定商品的价格时，是考虑到价值法则的。例如，众所周知，在生产一公担棉花时所花费的劳动要比生产一公担谷物时所花费的劳动多好几倍。因此，一公担棉花的价格就应该比一公担谷物的价格高得多。
    然而有些经济工作人员和计划工作人员却提出把谷物和棉花规定为同样的价格。斯大林同志问道：“假如这些同志们的建议获得了法律上的效力，结果会怎样呢？那我们就会使植棉者破产，就会没有棉花。”
    价值法则影响着个人消费品的商品交换。在劳动者货币收入的一定水平下，他们所能够得到的消费品的数量，就系于这些商品的价格的水平。然而，价值法则的这种影响由于社会主义经济的条件，并不带有自发性。在社会主义的经济中，国营的和合作社贸易中的商品流转的范围和构成，决定于计划。不论是居民的货币收入和物价，都是按照计划来规定的。斯大林同志还在一九二九年时即指示说：
    “在我国市场上并没有像在资本主义各国所常见的那种自由玩弄价格的现象。粮食价格基本上是由我们规定的。工业品价格是由我们规定的。我们努力实行减低成本费和减低工业品价格的政策，同时极力保持农产品价格的稳定性。市场上这样一种特殊的特别的秩序，是在资本主义各国内根本没有的，——这难道不很明白么？”（斯大林全集第十二卷，第四三—四四页，俄文版）
    苏维埃国家在规定消费品价格时，是考虑到价值法则的，是由社会主义基本经济法则出发的。这个基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。一贯所实行的有步骤的减低消费品国家零售价格的政策，提高着人民消费的水平。由于战后时期的五次减低物价，现在用五十卢布即可购买到一九四七年底用一百卢布所能买到的东西。
    价值法则的作用，如斯大林同志所指示，并不限于商品流通范围内，同时也扩展到生产方面。价值法则在我国社会主义生产中，并没有调节的作用，可是它总还影响生产。
    问题在于，为了抵偿生产过程中耗费的劳动力而必需的消费品，在我国是作为受价值法则支配的商品来生产和销售的。也正是在这里可以看出价值法则对生产的影响。因此，在社会主义的企业中，这样一些问题，如经济核算和赢利问题、成本问题、价格问题等等，就具有现实的意义。
    耗费在产品生产中的劳动量，在社会主义制度下是凭借价值及其形式来计算的。因此，我们的企业就不能不而且也不应该不考虑到价值法则的。社会主义国家手中的价值计算，是监督劳动量和消费量的工具。
    在社会主义企业中，价值计算对于估价、对于核算、对于确定企业的收入和亏损、对于财政机关实行以卢布监督经济计划执行情况方面，都是必须的。苏维埃国家在争取节约制度、赢利、扩大社会主义积累的斗争方面，利用着价值法则。
    在社会主义制度下，从整个国民经济的观点来看，保证有经久的和牢固的高级赢利形式，这种高级赢利形式是国民经济有计划发展法则的作用及计划化所提供出来的，因为它们使我国避免周期性的经济危机，并保证国民经济有高速度的不断增长。
    在目前的发展阶段上，为了正确地领导生产，我们的经济工作者必须研究价值法则、掌握它。
    斯大林同志指示说：“糟糕的并不是价值法则影响我国的生产。糟糕的是我们的经济工作人员和计划工作人员，除了少数的例外，对于价值法则所发生的作用知道得很差，不研究这种作用，不善于在自己的核算中考虑这种作用。”
    第十九次党代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示，责成一切大小经济建设岗位上的经济干部要厉行节约制度，提高企业的赢利。经济工作者的任务，在于寻找、发现和利用生产中所蕴藏的潜力，最大限度地利用现有的生产能力，有步骤地改善生产方法，降低产品成本，实现经济核算制。
    共产党和苏维埃政府，认识了经济法则，自觉地引导着社会主义经济的发展，使这种发展有利于我国的进一步繁荣，有利于不断提高人民的福利。三
    正如价值法则一样，价值是与商品生产的存在相关联的一种历史范畴。商品生产一消失，价值连同它的各种形式以及价值法则，也都要随之消失。
    当然，商品流通和集体农庄的所有制，在目前是被有成效地利用着来发展社会主义经济，而且它们也在给我国社会带来毫无疑问的利益。它在最近的将来也将带来利益。但是要注意到我们发展的前途。
    斯大林同志指示说，如果看不出这些现象现在已开始阻碍我国生产力的强大发展，那就是不可原谅的盲目了，因为它们正在阻碍着由国家计划化来完全包括全部国民经济、特别是包括农业。
    斯大林同志指出了商品生产和因而产生的价值法则是与共产主义的高级阶段不相容的，并以此给予把价值法则说成是历史以外的现象，说成为一切历史发展时期各生产部门之间的劳动分配的调节者的反马克思主义的概念，以致命的打击。
    社会主义社会的生产力的高涨，必将要求在全部国民经济范畴内设置一个全人民的所有制形式。当出现了有权支配全国一切消费品的一个无所不包的生产部门即国营部门和集体农庄部门之后，商品的生产和流通就会作为国民经济的不必要的因素而消失了。
    在共产主义社会的高级阶段，用于生产产品的劳动量，将不是以曲折迂回的方法，不是凭借价值及其各种形式来计算，而是直接地以花费在生产产品上的时间数量和钟点数量来计算的。斯大林同志指示说，这将是这样一种社会，在那里，生产将由社会的需要来调节，而计算社会的需要，对于计划机关将具有头等重要的意义。
    在准备过渡到共产主义的基本先决条件中，斯大林同志指示说，必须以用实行起来有利于集体农庄的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使国家工业和集体农庄之间用产品交换制来代替商品流通，使中央政权或其他某种社会经济中心能够为社会福利来掌握社会生产的全部产品。
    斯大林同志指出：“为了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，必须将集体农庄生产的剩余品从商品流通系统中排除出去，把它们列入国家工业和集体农庄间的产品交换系统中。”
    斯大林在自己的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，提出了产品交换这个实际任务的问题，这个任务在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义时代应为共产党所解决。
    在我国，社会主义的生产关系——社会生产力强大发展的主要的、决定性的力量——在巩固着。生产的发展和生产的完善化为改变集体农庄产品的销售形式，为逐渐缩减商品流通和代之以产品交换制，创造了必要条件。
    斯大林同志指出了在现在某些农产品的采购制度中，在农业生产品“换货”形式下的产品交换制的萌芽。
    那么怎样实现“换货”呢？在定购技术作物——棉花、亚麻、糖萝卜和其他作物时，集体农庄把农业原料供给国家不仅从政府那里取得货币，而且主要是取得比一般零售商品有显著更低价格的必要的制成品。
    在第十九次党代表大会上可以举出明确的例子，这些例子说明产品交换的存在会促使集体农庄的经济巩固和集体农庄庄员物质幸福的高涨。与国家订有这种合同的集体农庄会比没有这种合同的集体农庄获得更多的利益，现有的产品交换的萌芽将发展成为广大的产品交换制。
    斯大林同志指出，产品交换制需要大量地增加城市送交农村的产品，所以，推行这种制度无需特别急忙，要随着城市制成品积累的程度而定。但是应该一往直前，毫不犹豫地推行这种制度，缩小商品流通的活动范围，而扩大产品交换的活动范围。产品交换的实行，使社会主义易于过渡到共产主义，并有可能把集体农庄的基本财产、集体农庄生产的产品包括进全民计划化的总的系统中去。
    斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”用社会发展法则的知识来武装我们的干部，使我们能预见到事变的进程，教导我们认识和利用有利于胜利地建设共产主义的经济法则。
