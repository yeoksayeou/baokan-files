Investigation of Farmers' Purchasing Power in Tanjagou Village, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province
Zhao Qiming, Xu Yinghua

We participated in the rural purchasing power investigation team organized by the People's Economic Planning Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government and conducted an investigation in Tanjagou Village, Yixian County. The following is an excerpt of some of the materials obtained during the investigation for your reference:

I. How Much Purchasing Power Do Farmers Have?

Tanjagou Village is an ordinary cotton and grain-producing village in Yixian County. During the Japanese imperialist rule, the farmers were impoverished by exploitation; after the Japanese surrender, they were looted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the land reform after liberation, in addition to land, the poor farmers in the village received almost nothing else—especially production tools. In recent years, under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers in the village have been actively engaged in production, and their lives have generally improved. The village currently has 305 households with 1,424 people. At the time of the land reform, the village lacked carts and horses. Now the whole village has 64 carts, 16 mules and horses, 129 donkeys, 43 cattle, and 135 sheep, and has added many farm tools. The yield per unit area in the village continues to increase. This year, 154.6 hectares of cotton were planted (accounting for 36.8% of the sown area), with an average yield of 1,200 jin of seed cotton per hectare, an increase of 14.2% compared to 1951 and 60% compared to 1950. The total agricultural production value of the village this year is 925,854,000 yuan. The total purchasing power of the village this year is 686,512,000 yuan, with an average of 482,000 yuan per person.

It is estimated that the total agricultural production value of the village in 1953 will reach 1,074,413,000 yuan, and the total purchasing power will increase to 776,889,000 yuan, an increase of 13.1% compared to this year.

II. How Farmers Use Their Purchasing Power

A. Means of Production

Of the total purchasing power of 686,512,000 yuan of the village farmers in 1952, 244,200,000 yuan was used to purchase means of production. The varieties of means of production purchased, the amount of money spent, and the percentages are shown in the following table:

| Item             | Amount (Yuan) | Percentage |
|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Chemical Fertilizer | 122,100,000     | 50.0%      |
| Farm Implements    | 61,050,000      | 25.0%      |
| Insecticides       | 48,840,000      | 20.0%      |
| Fodder             | 12,210,000      | 5.0%       |
| Total            | 244,200,000     | 100.0%     |

Farmers are gradually paying attention to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In 1951, the village applied an average of 250 piles of manure per hectare of cotton field and 10,500 jin of topdressing (ammonium sulfate); in 1952, an average of 300 piles of manure per hectare of cotton field and 16,000 jin of topdressing (ammonium sulfate) were applied. In 1951, insecticide was sprayed twice, and in 1952, insecticide was sprayed four times. The farmers in the village are very interested in ammonium sulfate. They say: Applying ammonium sulfate can resist drought and insects, and can increase grain yield. This year, the supply of ammonium sulfate fell short of demand, and they are worried that they will not be able to buy ammonium sulfate next year.

Because there are technical problems with the use of 1605 pesticide and tobacco powder, the effect is not very good, so they are not very willing to use them. Farmers welcome lime-sulfur mixture the most, because they feel that it is effective, easy to mix with water, and the concentration does not cause much damage to cotton. When cotton red spiders were rampant this year, the supply of lime-sulfur mixture could not keep up, and farmers hope to be able to buy this kind of medicine at home before the Dragon Boat Festival next year.

Farm implements. Farmers in the village reported that the quality of the hoe blades supplied by the cooperative is not good, the noses are easy to fall off, and the supply is not timely; the loaned sprayers are also of poor quality, the pipes are short and the balls are small, and they are not durable. Next year, many people want to buy sprayers and are willing to spend more money, but they want good ones.

Farmers have an urgent demand for feed, especially soybean cake, but this year's soybean cake supply cannot meet the demand. Farmers in the village had to take more than 2,000 jin of soybeans to private merchants for processing, which cost them a lot of processing fees; they also ground some grain to feed livestock. Because the feed problem has not been well resolved, the draft animals have become thin and the production of fat pigs has been greatly reduced. This not only affects manure accumulation, but also affects farmers' income. Therefore, farmers are very dissatisfied with the shortage of feed, especially soybean cake and bran.

It is estimated that the village farmers will spend 306,300,000 yuan on purchasing means of production in 1953. The varieties of means of production purchased, the amount of money spent, and the percentages are shown in the following table:

| Item             | Amount (Yuan) | Percentage |
|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Chemical Fertilizer | 153,150,000     | 50.0%      |
| Farm Implements    | 76,575,000      | 25.0%      |
| Insecticides       | 61,260,000      | 20.0%      |
| Fodder             | 15,315,000      | 5.0%       |
| Total            | 306,300,000     | 100.0%     |

B. Means of Livelihood

According to the comparison between the grain production and consumption of the village, there is a surplus in addition to consumption. However, a food shortage occurred during summer weeding this year. The reason is that households with surplus grain are afraid of "revealing their wealth" and are unwilling to sell or lend it. Farmers are extremely concerned about the adjustment and supply of grain.

The varieties of cloth purchased by the village farmers this year and planned to be purchased next year and the amount of money spent are shown in the following table:

| Cloth Type      | 1952 Amount (Yuan) | 1953 Planned Amount (Yuan) |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| White Cloth     | 87,514,600         | 93,950,200               |
| Colored Cloth   | 175,029,200        | 187,900,400              |
| Flower Cloth    | 87,514,600         | 93,950,200               |
| Total         | 350,058,400        | 375,800,800              |

Farmers' requirements for cloth are: large quantity, good quality, and beauty. Their demand for white fine cloth, colored cloth, and flower cloth has greatly increased. It is worth mentioning in particular the women. In the past, they mostly wore blue cloth and white cloth, but now they prefer to wear tinted cloth, blue cloth, and flower cloth. They generally reported that the tinted cloth in the cooperative is gray and not bright, and there is no plain twill cloth, and there are not many patterns of flower cloth, and only large flowers, not small flowers. If they cannot buy the cloth they like in the cooperative, they go to Yixian City to buy it, and if they cannot buy it in Yixian City, they ask people to buy it in Jinzhou.

Farmers' demand for general merchandise is also constantly increasing. In 1952, the village purchased 1,113 pairs of knitted socks; and 344 pairs of rubber shoes (including sneakers). Although the number of varieties of general merchandise in the cooperative has increased from 69 to 141, it is far from meeting the needs of farmers, especially the needs of women. White rubber shoes and sneakers that women like to wear are hard to find in the cooperative that fit. They said that the cooperative only serves men and does not pay much attention to the needs of women.

With the development of agricultural production, cultural and educational undertakings have also developed greatly, the number of students has increased year by year, and the demand for stationery has greatly increased. In 1950, the village had 150 primary school students, and only 4% of the primary school students had fountain pens; in 1951, the number of primary school students increased to 204, of whom 40% had fountain pens; in 1952, the number of primary school students increased to 229, of whom 54% already had fountain pens.

In 1952, the village farmers spent a total of 437,573,000 yuan on purchasing means of livelihood; it is estimated that in 1953, the total amount of money spent on purchasing means of livelihood will increase to 469,751,000 yuan.

In addition, in 1952, the village farmers spent a total of 4,739,000 yuan on purchasing building materials; it is estimated that in 1953, the whole village will spend 838,000 yuan on purchasing building materials.

C. Remaining Purchasing Power

According to the investigation, the total value of the remaining purchasing power of the village this year is 41,490,000 yuan, accounting for 6% of the total purchasing power of the village. The trends, amounts, and percentages of this remaining purchasing power are shown in the following table:

| Trend          | Amount (Yuan) | Percentage |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Lending        | 20,745,000      | 50.0%      |
| Doing Business | 8,298,000       | 20.0%      |
| Saving Silver  | 12,447,000      | 30.0%      |
| Total         | 41,490,000      | 100.0%     |

The trend of remaining purchasing power is very noteworthy. Why don't farmers use this power to expand reproduction, but instead lend money, do business, and even save silver? What methods should be used to mobilize farmers to use their remaining purchasing power to expand reproduction? Under various different circumstances, in which direction should the expansion of reproduction develop? These issues, we hope, will attract everyone's attention and research.

    辽西省义县谈家沟村农民购买力调查
    赵岐明　徐瑛华
    我们参加了辽西省人民政府人民经济计划委员会所组织的农村购买力调查组，到义县谈家沟村进行了调查，现将调查中所得到的一些材料摘录如下，以供参考：
    一、农民的购买力有多大
    谈家沟村是义县一个普通的出产棉花和粮食的村庄。在日本帝国主义统治时期，农民被压榨得已很贫困了；日本投降以后，又被国民党反动派掠夺一空。解放后进行土地改革时，该村贫苦农民除分到土地以外，其他的东西——特别是生产工具，几乎没有分到。几年来，该村农民在共产党和人民政府的领导与扶持下，积极进行生产，生活已普遍上升。该村现有三○五户，一四二四口人。土地改革时村中缺车少马。现在全村已有大车六十四辆，骡马十六匹，驴一百二十九头，牛四十三头，羊一百三十五只，并且添置了很多农具。全村单位面积产量不断提高。今年种棉一五四点六垧（占播种面积百分之三六点八），平均每垧产籽棉一千二百斤，产量比一九五一年提高百分之十四点二，比一九五零年提高百分之六十。全村今年的农业生产总值是九二五、八五四、○○○元。全村今年的购买力总值是六八六、五一二、○○○元，每人平均四八二、○○○元。
    预计该村一九五三年的农业生产总值将达一、○七四、四一三、○○○元，购买力总值将提高到七七六、八八九、○○○元，即比今年提高百分之一三点一。
    二、农民购买力的使用情形
    甲、生产资料
    一九五二年全村农民购买力总值六八六、五一二、○○○元中，用于购买生产资料的有二四四、二○○、○○○元，购买生产资料的品种、钱数及其百分比如下表：
    农民对于化学肥料和农药是逐渐重视起来了。该村一九五一年平均每垧棉田施土粪二五○堆，施追肥（硫安）一○、五○○斤；一九五二年平均每垧棉田施土粪三○○堆，施追肥（硫安）一六、○○○斤。一九五一年打了两遍杀虫药水，一九五二年打了四遍杀虫药水。该村农民对于硫安很感兴趣。他们说：上了硫安，又抗旱又抗虫，可以多打粮食。今年的硫安供不应求，他们很耽心明年买不到硫安。
    对于一六零五药水和烟草粉，因为使用技术有问题，效果不很好，因而不大乐意用。农民最欢迎石灰硫黄合剂，觉得它效力大，容易配水，浓些稀些对棉花的损害都不大。今年棉花红蜘蛛正盛时，石灰硫黄合剂供应不上，农民希望明年端阳节以前就能把这种药买到家里。
    农具。该村农民反映：合作社供应的锄板的质量不好，容易掉鼻子，而且供应不及时；贷的喷雾器质量也不好，管短球小，不耐久。明年有不少人要买喷雾器，愿意多花点钱，但要好的。
    农民对于饲料、特别是对豆饼的要求很迫切，而今年的豆饼却供不应求，该村农民只好拿两千多斤大豆去找私商加工，出了很高的加工费；还碾了些粮食喂牲畜。由于饲料问题未很好解决，耕畜喂瘦了，肥猪也大大减产了。这不仅影响积肥，还影响农民的收入。因此，农民对于饲料、特别是豆饼和糠的供不应求，很不满意。
    预计该村农民在一九五三年用于购买生产资料的钱将达三○六、三○○、○○○元，购买生产资料的品种，钱数及百分比如下表：
    乙、生活资料
    按该村的粮食生产量和消费量对比，除食用外还有剩余。但今年在夏锄时还发生了粮荒，原因是有余粮的户怕“露富”，不愿意出卖或出借。农民对粮食的调剂和供应问题极为关心。
    全村农民今年购买和明年计划购买的布匹品种和钱数如下表：
    农民对于布匹的要求是：数量多，质量好，美观。他们对白细布、有色布和花布的需要量大大增加了。这里值得特别提到的是妇女。她们过去多是穿青布、白布，现在多喜欢穿靠色布、蓝色布和花布。她们普遍反映合作社的靠色布发灰，不鲜艳，又没有素花的斜纹布，花布的样子也不多，而且只有大花的，没有小花的。她们在合作社买不到自己所喜欢的布，就到义县城去买，在义县城买不到就请人到锦州去买。
    农民对于百货的需求量也是不断增加的。一九五二年全村购买的针织袜子即有一、一一三双；购买的胶鞋（包括球鞋）有三四四双。合作社的百货品种虽由六九种增至一四一种，还远远满足不了农民的要求，特别满足不了妇女们的要求。妇女们喜欢穿的白胶鞋和球鞋，在合作社很难买到合脚的。她们说，合作社是只给男人服务的，不大照顾妇女们的需要。
    随着农业生产的发展，文化教育事业也有很大发展，学生的数目逐年增加，对文具的需求是大大增加了。该村一九五○年有一五○名小学生，当时只有百分之四的小学生有自来水钢笔；一九五一年小学生增至二○四名，其中百分之四十有了自来水钢笔；一九五二年小学生人数增至二二九人，其中已有百分之五十四有自来水钢笔了。
    一九五二年该村农民用于购买生活资料的钱，总值是四三七、五七三、○○○元；预计一九五三年用于购买生活资料的钱，总值将增至四六九、七五一、○○○元。
    另外，在一九五二年该村农民购买力总值中，用于购买建筑材料的钱共为四、七三九、○○○元；预计一九五三年全村用于购买建筑材料的钱将为八三八、○○○元。
    丙、剩余购买力
    据调查，全村今年的剩余购买力总值是四一、四九○、○○○元，占全村购买力总值的百分之六，这些剩余购买力的动向、金额及百分比如下表：
    剩余购买力的动向是很值得注意的。农民为什么不把这种力量用于扩大再生产，而来放债，作生意，甚至存白银呢？用什么方法动员农民用剩余购买力来扩大再生产呢？在各种不同的情况下，扩大再生产应该朝着什么方向发展呢？这些问题，希望引起大家的注意和研究。
