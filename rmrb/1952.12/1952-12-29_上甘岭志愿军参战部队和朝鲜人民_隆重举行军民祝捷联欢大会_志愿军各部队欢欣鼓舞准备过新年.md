Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 28th: The Chinese People's Volunteers, who participated in the Shangganling Campaign, and outstanding representatives of the Korean people in the battle zone who actively supported the front line, solemnly held a military-civilian victory celebration rally in mid-December. Thirty combat heroes from the Volunteers and one hundred and fifty model figures from the Korean people who supported the front line attended. They gathered in a warm shelter, celebrating the glorious victory they had jointly forged.

During the fierce fighting in the Shangganling area for more than a month, a total of 8,429 Korean people, Labor Party members, and local government cadres (including 910 women) from the three counties of Kimhwa, Pyongyang, and Pyonggang enthusiastically participated in the work of supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers on the front line. They carried the wounded under artillery fire, set up tea stations on the roads leading to the front, and organized song and dance troupes to perform慰问 performances on the front line. In order to help the Volunteers keep warm, they also chopped 100,000 jin of firewood and burned 200,000 jin of charcoal, which were sent to the front line positions. They also sent more than 10,000 jin of green vegetables, radishes, and a large amount of tofu to the Volunteer soldiers. Hundreds of model figures emerged among them, such as the great internationalist martyr Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed his life to protect wounded Volunteer soldiers, Park Byung-ok, a Korean woman who donated blood to wounded and sick Volunteer soldiers, and Ham Jae-bok, the "Volunteer Army Mother" who washed more than 700 pieces of blood-stained clothing for the wounded. Their enthusiasm for supporting the front greatly encouraged the heroic Volunteer soldiers.

At the victory celebration and commendation meeting, Che Minqiao, director of the political department of a certain unit of the Volunteers, on behalf of the Volunteer combat troops, expressed sincere gratitude to the Korean people in the battle zone who actively supported the front line. Director Che took off the peace dove commemorative badge from his chest and presented it to Li Yushan, the wife of martyr Park Jae-geun, one of the chairmen of the meeting. The entire audience burst into enthusiastic and prolonged applause. Amidst the joyful military music, representatives of the Volunteer combat heroes presented dozens of silk banners and a large number of慰问 letters to the Korean people in the battle zone, and pinned glory flowers on the models who supported the front line. Volunteer combat hero representatives Lü Xuemin, Deng Minghan, Chen Guangyou and others also specially presented the most beloved gifts given to them by the motherland's 慰问团 to Korea—enamel mugs with the words "Presented to the Most Beloved People" and silk handkerchiefs printed with Chairman Mao's image—to the families of martyrs such as Park Jae-geun, Kim Eung-sik, and Kim Man-bae.

Li Mingfu, chairman of the Pyongyang County Labor Party Committee, spoke on behalf of all the Korean people in the battle zone, saying, "The great internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers who fought bravely to defend every inch of Korean people's land in the Shangganling Campaign will never be forgotten by the Korean people for generations to come." Li Yushan, the wife of martyr Park Jae-geun, also spoke at the meeting, saying, "My husband sacrificed his life, and I am determined to step up production and more actively support the front line, and strive to defeat the enemies who killed our loved ones as soon as possible!" The Korean people's front-line support models who attended the meeting also presented a large number of慰问 letters and silk banners to the Volunteer combat hero representatives.

The meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram from the Korean people in the battle zone to Chairman Mao and a congratulatory telegram from the Volunteer troops participating in the Shangganling Campaign to General Kim Il-sung. In their telegrams, they pledged to unite more closely in the future and strike a heavier blow to the common enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 28th: The Chinese People's Volunteers on the front line have made all preparations to celebrate the New Year. As early as the beginning of December, the Volunteer transportation troops transported a large number of New Year's goods to the front line.

The New Year's goods transported to the front line this year are extremely abundant. Although the Volunteer troops guarding the eastern front line are located in high mountains, remote areas, and snow-covered mountains, they have also received sufficient meat, vegetables, and wine. Some troops also have many livestock such as pigs, sheep, and chickens raised by themselves, as well as foods such as oranges, candies, cigarettes, and sausages transported from the motherland. The soldiers all said: "Our victories are getting bigger year by year, and we are having a better New Year year by year!"

In order to enable the troops to enthusiastically carry out New Year's entertainment activities, the logistics organs of the Volunteer troops have also purchased a large number of cultural and recreational equipment such as gongs, drums, erhus, harmonicas, and flutes and sent them to the front line positions. The soldiers are actively rehearsing New Year's performance programs during the breaks in the fighting. The cultural troupe and soldiers' singing team of the troops participating in the Shangganling Campaign have compiled the deeds of heroes such as Huang Jiguang, Sun Zhanyuan, Yi Caixue, and Qiu Shaoyun into various singing works, preparing to go to the troops for巡回 performances during the New Year. The film projection team has prepared films such as "Steel Warrior" and "An Ordinary Soldier" to show to the soldiers during the New Year. Some troops are also actively cleaning up snow, building ball fields, and preparing to hold New Year's ball games. In addition, a large number of chess sets, playing cards,康乐球 tables, and ping-pong balls have also been sent into the forward tunnels and fortifications for the soldiers to entertain themselves.

The leaders of the troops participating in the Shangganling Campaign specially printed exquisite New Year's cards and New Year's letters, preparing to send them to the wounded, combat heroes, and people's meritorious servants.

When the Volunteer soldiers are happily preparing to celebrate the New Year on the positions, there is a deathly silence on the enemy positions dozens or hundreds of meters away. The enemies hiding in the cold bunkers are frightened and uneasy all day long. According to soldiers of the 7th Division of the Li Pseudo Army who were recently captured, the "fist rice" they are eating now (Pseudo Army soldiers are required to eat a rice ball the size of a fist for each meal, hence the name "fist rice") is even colder than the rice in autumn.

    上甘岭志愿军参战部队和朝鲜人民
    隆重举行军民祝捷联欢大会
    志愿军各部队欢欣鼓舞准备过新年
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】参加上甘岭战役的中国人民志愿军某部和在战斗中积极支援前线的战区朝鲜人民的杰出的代表们，在十二月中旬隆重地举行了一次军民祝捷联欢大会。参加的代表有三十位志愿军战斗英雄和一百五十位朝鲜人民支援前线的模范人物，他们欢聚在温暖的掩蔽部里，欢庆共同铸造的辉煌胜利。
    在上甘岭地区一个多月的激烈战斗中，金化、淮阳、平康三个郡（县）里的朝鲜人民、劳动党员和地方政府干部共八千四百二十九人（其中妇女九百一十人），热烈地参加了支援前线志愿军的工作。他们在炮火下抬伤员，在通向前线的路上设立茶水站，并且组织歌舞队到前线进行慰问演出。为了帮助志愿军防寒，他们还打了十万斤木柴，烧了二十万斤木炭，送到前线阵地上。他们并把一万多斤青菜、萝卜及大批豆腐送给志愿军战士。在他们中间出现了数百名模范人物，如舍身掩护志愿军伤员的伟大国际主义者朴在根烈士，为志愿军伤病员输血的朝鲜妇女朴炳玉，为伤员洗了七百多件血衣的
    “志愿军妈妈”咸在福等。他们支援前线的热情大大鼓舞了英勇作战的志愿军战士们。
    在祝捷贺功大会上，志愿军某部政治部主任车敏樵代表志愿军作战部队向积极支援前线的战区朝鲜人民表示深切的感谢。车主任从自己胸前摘下和平鸽纪念章赠给大会主席之一朴在根烈士的妻子李玉善，全场为此响起了热烈的经久不息的掌声。志愿军战斗英雄代表们在欢乐的军乐声中献给战区朝鲜人民数十幅锦旗和大批慰问信，并为到会的支援前线模范们一一佩戴光荣花。志愿军战斗英雄代表吕学敏、邓明汉、陈光有等还特别将祖国人民赴朝慰问团赠给自己的最心爱的礼物——有“赠给最可爱的人”字样的搪瓷缸及印有毛主席像的绢帕，赠给朴在根、金应植、金万培等烈士的家属。
    淮阳郡劳动党委员长李明福代表全体战区朝鲜人民在会上讲话，他说：“中国人民志愿军在上甘岭战役中为保卫朝鲜人民每一寸土地而英勇战斗的伟大国际主义精神，是我们朝鲜人民千秋万代都不会忘记的。”朴在根烈士的妻子李玉善也在会上讲了话，她说：“我的丈夫牺牲了，我决心加紧生产，更积极地支援前线，争取早日打败杀害我们亲人的仇敌！”到会的朝鲜人民支援前线模范也把大批慰问信和锦旗献给志愿军战斗英雄代表们。
    会上通过了战区朝鲜人民给毛主席的致敬电和上甘岭战役志愿军参战部队给金日成将军的致敬电。他们在电文中保证今后要更加团结一致，更沉重地打击共同的敌人。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】中国人民志愿军在前线已经做好了一切欢度新年的准备工作。早在十二月上旬，志愿军运输部队就把大批年货运到了前线。
    今年运到前线的年货极为丰富，守卫在东部前线的志愿军某部虽然山高路远、冰雪封山，也得到了充足的肉类、菜蔬和酒。有的部队还有许多自己饲养的猪、羊、鸡等牲畜以及由祖国运来的橘子、糖果、纸烟、腊肠等食物。战士们都说：“我们的胜利一年比一年大，过年也一年比一年过得好了！”
    为着使部队能热烈开展新年文娱活动，志愿军各部队的后勤机关还采办了锣鼓、二胡、口琴、笛子等大批文娱器材送到前线阵地。战士们在战斗的空隙里正积极排练新年的演出节目。上甘岭战役参战部队的文工团和战士演唱队已将黄继光、孙占元、易才学、邱少云等英雄人物的事迹编成各种演唱作品，准备新年时到部队巡回演出。电影放映队已经准备好“钢铁战士”、“普通一兵”等影片在新年时给战士们放映。有的部队还积极打扫积雪，修筑球场、准备举行新年球赛。此外，大批象棋、扑克、康乐球、乒乓球也送进了前沿坑道工事，供战士们娱乐。
    上甘岭战役参战部队的首长特印制了精致的贺年片、贺年信，准备送给伤病员、战斗英雄和人民功臣。
    当志愿军战士在阵地上欢欣鼓舞地准备欢度新年的时候，对面几十或几百公尺的敌军阵地上却是一片死寂。躲在寒冷的地堡里的敌人终日提心吊胆，惴惴不安。据最近俘掳的李伪军第七师的士兵说，他们现在吃的“拳头饭”（伪军士兵每餐规定吃一个饭团，如拳头大小，故称“拳头饭”），比秋天的饭更加冰凉了。
