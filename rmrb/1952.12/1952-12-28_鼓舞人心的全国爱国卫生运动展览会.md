The National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, has opened in Beijing. The thousands of exhibits displayed in the main hall of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace clearly depict the unprecedented scale of the patriotic health campaign over the past nine months, demonstrating the great power of the new Chinese people in crushing the enemy's germ warfare.

At the entrance of the venue is Chairman Mao's inscription: "Get mobilized, pay attention to hygiene, reduce diseases, improve health standards, and crush the enemy's germ warfare."

The exhibition first exposes the crimes of American imperialism in conducting germ warfare with objects and photographs. The situation of the patriotic health campaign launched by people of all walks of life across the country to counter American imperialism's germ warfare is then displayed to the audience through a series of photographs. After the power of the broad masses of the people is mobilized, countless miracles can be created: for example, if each train car carries thirty tons of goods, then the flies eliminated in this patriotic health campaign could fill two hundred and thirty-three train cars; the mosquitoes eliminated could fill one hundred and ninety-five train cars; the rats caught could fill five hundred train cars; the sewers built in this patriotic health campaign, if connected, would be as long as twelve canals; the ditches dredged, if connected, would be fifty-five times longer than the Yangtze River; and the garbage cleared would be twice as long as the Great Wall.

The vast cities and countryside, after this patriotic health campaign, seem to have taken a bath, especially in some extremely dirty places, the results are even more remarkable. Many photos and huge three-dimensional models in the exhibition make a clear comparison of the past and present of these places. Here is a disgusting photo - the situation of Taoranting in the southern part of Beijing before the patriotic health campaign: this area was full of reed ponds, depressions and puddles, overgrown with weeds and littered with garbage. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to the lack of municipal construction, sewage from the southern part of the city flowed into this area, and the waste water from nearby factories accumulated, making Taoranting a breeding ground for flies and mosquitoes. In summer, the stench was everywhere, and no one wanted to go near it. But in the patriotic health campaign, Taoranting was completely changed. The following photos show that Taoranting has become a scenic spot. The stinky ponds and humid depressions have been dredged and excavated into clean lakes, and large sewers have been built around them. The Beijing Municipal People's Government will also plant greenery in Taoranting next year. The colored model here shows the greening plan of Taoranting: it will become a beautiful park, with a clear pond in the middle, surrounded by trees, flowers and plants, and many chairs. Exquisite pavilions, rockeries and sports grounds will also be built in the garden.

The minority nationalities have greatly changed their past unhygienic habits after this patriotic health campaign. The exhibition uses many photos to reflect the past and present lives of the Miao people in Yuyu Village, Miao Autonomous Region of Daming Mountain, Guangxi Province: Yuyu Village has more than one hundred households, all living on the top of high mountains, and transportation is very inconvenient. Before liberation, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel oppression of them, they could not even take care of food and clothing, let alone hygiene. There was not a single toilet in the village, and residents defecated on the mountains or beside the village at will. Drinking water all depended on natural springs on the mountain, where people washed clothes and vegetables; around were indigo vats for dyeing cloth. People and livestock lived together, and pig manure and cow dung were everywhere. When people got sick, they could only ask the ghosts and gods and wait for death. After liberation, the People's Government quickly sent health work teams to explain hygiene knowledge to the residents and carry out medical treatment work. In this patriotic health campaign, the health level of the people in Yuyu Village, Miao Autonomous Region of Daming Mountain has been greatly improved, and the people have generally developed hygienic habits such as bathing, washing their hair and changing clothes. They no longer drink raw water, and carry bamboo tubes filled with boiled water when they go to work on the mountain. Environmental sanitation has also been greatly improved: toilets have now been built throughout the village; weeds have been cleared from the edge of the village, and bamboo water troughs have been scrubbed. The People's Government has also helped the Miao people train their own vaccinators and midwives. After being educated in this patriotic health campaign, the people of Yuyu Village no longer have superstitions. They have generally formulated patriotic health covenants to ensure that health work is carried out regularly.

From April to June this year, 320,000 people (including migrant workers and the People's Liberation Army) worked hard on the great Jingjiang flood diversion construction site. In this season, it is easy to get sick with so many people crowded in the wilderness, but the health work on the construction site was done well, ensuring the health of the workers. The workers maintained an attendance rate of over 95%. When the representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference visited the construction site, they praised the health work of the construction site as a small miracle in a great miracle. Pictures and charts tell us that a very detailed health organization was established on the construction site: below the health department of the general headquarters of the project, there were health organizations at all levels, with a total of 99 institutions including hospitals, sanatoriums, medical stations, medical teams, and migrant workers environmental health work teams. There were five health workers for every thousand migrant workers. Windows were added to the workers' sheds. To avoid humidity, the workers slept on high bunks. To ensure drinking water safety, boiled water stations were set up everywhere on the construction site. Dealing with the excrement of 320,000 people was a big problem on the construction site, especially in hot weather, when feces are very easy to spread gastrointestinal diseases; but the feces were handled very well there. Not only a large number of toilets were built, but also the nearby residents were mobilized to transport the feces away every day, maintaining the sanitation of the construction site.

The great Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to defend the frontiers of the motherland and liberate Tibet, climbed snow-capped mountains four to five thousand meters above sea level and entered the Kangzang Plateau, known as the roof of the world. The exhibition uses a huge photo to narrate how health work guaranteed the health of the soldiers marching into Tibet, enabling them to successfully complete the plateau march. During their march, they built sand filter wells themselves; to improve nutrition, they dried beef jerky, picked wild vegetables, ground tofu, and sprouted beans in discarded preserved meat boxes... To prevent vitamin C deficiency, they collected wild vinegar pomegranate fruits and made a large amount of vinegar pomegranate juice for consumption. The snow light on the high mountains is dazzling and easily causes snow blindness. The soldiers created "yak hair shading glasses" to prevent snow blindness. This fully shows that the People's Liberation Army has a high level of health knowledge.

The broad masses of the people demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and creativity in the patriotic health campaign. The exhibition uses photos and colored comic strips to vividly introduce the deeds of many health model figures and units. The exhibition also displays various tools created by the masses to eliminate disease-carrying animals, as well as many hygienic toilets, sand filters, seepage wells, kitchens and dining room models.

The last part of the exhibition uses records in Chinese historical materials and unearthed objects from ancient tombs to illustrate that cleanliness and hygiene are the fine traditions of the Chinese people. There are many records about hygiene in oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty more than 3,000 years ago. Ancient China attached considerable importance to personal and environmental hygiene. The biographies of Hua Tuo in the Book of Later Han and the Golden Mirror of Medicine also recorded historical examples of preventive medicine thinking in China. From the unearthed objects of the Warring States, Han, Tang and other eras, it can be seen that ancient China attached importance to the construction of sewers and the sanitation of well water and toilets. Later, due to the long-term oppression and devastation of imperialism and feudalism in China, the serious situation of people not paying attention to hygiene and the prevalence of diseases was created. After liberation, due to the attention of the People's Government, the health conditions of the people have fundamentally improved. The exhibition also briefly introduces the achievements of health work in various aspects in the past three years.

At the exit of the venue, a huge banner is erected, which reads: "The patriotic health campaign has attacked the enemy, improved ourselves, and played a role in changing customs and habits." This exhibition vividly embodies this sentence.

    鼓舞人心的全国爱国卫生运动展览会
    新华社记者　吕新初　张丽君
    中央人民政府卫生部举办的全国爱国卫生运动展览会在北京开幕了。陈列在北京劳动人民文化宫大殿内的一千几百件展览品清楚地绘出了九个月来规模空前的爱国卫生运动的面貌，显示了新中国人民粉碎敌人细菌战的伟大力量。
    会场入口处，有毛主席的亲笔题词：“动员起来，讲究卫生，减少疾病，提高健康水平，粉碎敌人的细菌战争。”
    展览会首先以实物和照片揭露出美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。全国各阶层人民为反击美帝国主义的细菌战而掀起的爱国卫生运动的情况，随即通过照片一幅幅地显示在观众面前。广大人民的力量发动起来以后便可以创造出无数奇迹：如以每一节列车装三十吨货物计算的话，那么，这次爱国卫生运动中扑灭的苍蝇，可以装满二百三十三节列车；扑灭的蚊虫，可以装满一百九十五节列车；捕捉的老鼠可以装满五百节列车；这次爱国卫生运动中修建的下水道如果联结起来就有十二条运河那么长；疏通的沟渠如果联结起来比长江还要长五十五倍；清除的垃圾堆积起来比万里长城还要长一倍。
    广大城市和农村，经过这次爱国卫生运动好像洗了澡一般，特别是有些原来极肮脏的地方，成绩更为显著。展览会中许多照片和巨大的立体模型把这些地方的今昔作了鲜明的对比。这里是一张令人厌恶的照片——北京南城陶然亭在爱国卫生运动以前的情况：这一带全是苇塘、洼地和水坑，野草丛生，垃圾遍地，在国民党反动统治时代，由于市政不修，南城一带污水流入该区，加之附近工厂的废水污水停蓄，致使陶然亭一带成为蝇蚊的温床，夏天臭气四溢，谁都不愿意走近那里。但在爱国卫生运动中，陶然亭完全变了样。接下去的几幅照片显示出陶然亭已变成了一个风景区。臭水塘和潮湿的洼地被疏通掏挖后变成了清洁的湖泊，周围并修建了大型的下水道。北京市人民政府明年还要绿化陶然亭。这里的彩色模型表示着陶然亭的绿化计划：它将变成一个美丽的公园，中间是一个清澈的池塘，周围种植着树木花草，放着许多椅子。花园内还修建了精致的亭子、假山和运动场。
    少数民族经过这次爱国卫生运动大大改变了过去不卫生的习惯。展览会上用很多幅照片反映了广西省大苗山苗族自治区雨玉村苗族人民生活的今昔：雨玉村共一百多户，都居住在高山顶上，交通很不便。解放前，由于国民党反动派对他们的残酷压榨，吃穿都顾不上，那能讲卫生。村里没有一个厕所，居民随意在山上或村旁大小便。饮水全靠山上自然的流泉，泉旁有人洗衣，也有人洗菜；周围都是染布的靛桶。人和牲畜同住，猪屎牛粪更是遍地皆是。人们生了病，只有求鬼神，等待死亡。解放后，人民政府很快地派来了卫生工作队，向居民讲解卫生常识，同时进行医药治疗工作。在这次爱国卫生运动中，大苗山苗族自治区雨玉村人民卫生水平大大提高，人民普遍地养成了洗澡、洗头和换洗衣服等卫生习惯。他们不再喝生水，上山做活时都背着盛有开水的竹筒。环境卫生也大为改善：现在全村已普遍修建了厕所；清除了村边杂草，刷洗了竹制水槽。人民政府并帮助苗族人民训练了自己的种痘员和接生员。雨玉村人民经过这次爱国卫生运动的教育后，已不再迷信，他们普遍订立了爱国卫生公约，要使卫生工作经常进行下去。
    今年四月到六月，在伟大的荆江分洪工地上，三十二万人（包括民工和解放军）紧张地工作着。在这个季节里，这样多的人稠集在旷野里是很容易染病的，但由于工地的卫生工作做得好，保证了工人的健康。工人们经常保持着百分之九十五以上的出勤率。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们来到工地参观时，对工地的卫生工作赞为大奇迹中的小奇迹。画片和图表告诉我们，工地上建立着极细密的卫生组织：在工程的总指挥部卫生部以下，逐级有卫生组织，有医院、休养院、医疗站、医疗小组、民工环境卫生工作队等共九十九个机构。每一千个民工中就有五个卫生人员。工棚都增设了窗户。为了避免潮湿，工人睡的都是高铺。为了保障饮水安全，工地上到处设有开水站。在工地上处理三十二万人的便溺是一个大问题，特别在热天，粪便是极易传染肠胃病的；但那里对粪便处理得很好，不但建筑了大批厕所，而且发动附近居民每天将粪便运走，保持了工地的卫生。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，为了保卫祖国的边疆和解放西藏，攀登了拔海四、五千公尺的雪山，进入以世界屋脊著称的康藏高原。展览会上以巨幅照片叙述了卫生工作如何保证了进军西藏的战士们的健康，使他们能胜利地完成高原行军的任务。他们在行军途中，自建了砂滤井；为改善营养，他们自己晒牛肉干，采野菜，磨豆腐，用废腊肉箱泡豆芽……。为防止丙种维生素缺乏病，他们采集野生醋榴果子，制造大量供服用的醋榴汁。高山雪光耀眼，容易引起雪盲，战士们自己创造了“牛毛遮光镜”，可以预防雪盲。这充分说明了人民解放军是有高度卫生知识水平的。
    广大人民在爱国卫生运动中表现了高度的爱国热情与创造精神。展览会用照片和彩色的连环画形象地介绍了许多卫生模范人物和单位的事迹。展览会上并陈列着群众创造的各种扑灭病媒动物的工具，以及许多合乎卫生的厕所、砂滤器、渗水井、厨房和饭厅的模型。
    展览会最后一部分以中国史料上的记载和古墓出土物，说明了爱清洁讲卫生是中国人民的优良传统。在三千多年前商代的甲骨文中已有许多关于卫生的记事。我国古代对于个人和环境卫生就是相当重视的。在后汉书华佗传和医宗金鉴等书中还记载了我国预防医学思想的史例。从陈列的战国、汉、唐等时代的出土物上可以看出我国古代重视下水道的修建和井水卫生、厕所卫生等。后来由于帝国主义和封建主义在中国的长期压迫和摧残，才造成人民不讲卫生和疾病流行的严重情况。解放以后，由于人民政府的重视，人民的卫生状况已根本好转。展览会并扼要地介绍了三年来卫生工作各方面的成就。
    在会场出口处，竖立着一块巨大的标语牌，上面写着：“爱国卫生运动，打击了敌人，提高了自己，起了移风易俗的作用。”这个展览会以生动的形象体现了这句话。
