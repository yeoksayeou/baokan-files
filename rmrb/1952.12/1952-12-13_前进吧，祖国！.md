    Forward, Motherland!
    Wei Wei
    In the sound of gunfire, snowflakes have once again covered Korea. This is the third year of the Korean War. Friends, you must be envious of me, here, I have once again seen our beloved soldiers. They have been away from our beloved motherland for two years. In these two years, they have endured so much hardship. Two years is not a long time, but I have seen many commanders with wrinkles on their foreheads, and some with streaks of gray in their temples. Soldiers, thousands upon thousands of soldiers, their hands are all covered in thick calluses. It is with these hands that they have cleaved and tunneled through the mountains and ridges from the east coast to the west coast, connecting them into a dense, spiderweb-like underground Great Wall. They stand on this Great Wall, striking and tormenting those beasts that have not yet been completely wiped out; and it is also on this Great Wall that they look back to the north—to their own motherland.
    The motherland—for a soldier who has been away for two years, how captivating it is. When talking about the motherland, of course, they are missing their mothers, their wives, and their friends; but they are even more passionately talking about one thing, everyone is talking about it, everywhere is talking about it, in all those winding trenches covered in gunpowder smoke, they are all talking about one thing—the construction of the motherland. You can see that in many commanders' quarters, next to a vase with a bouquet of wildflowers, beside their military maps, there are color photos of Hao Jianxiu, as well as photos clipped from newspapers and magazines of the Huai River project, the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and modern railways and factories. In the soldiers' shelters, there are also pictures of these: many smiling children, tractors appearing for the first time on the motherland's collective farms, and factories chugging smoke. Even those who gloriously sacrificed themselves for the motherland and for the cause of peace have photos illustrating the progress of the motherland, stained with blood along with their letters of determination.
    The motherland is moving forward. The motherland's rapid construction is so exciting to its sons and daughters fighting abroad. Motherland, on the war front filled with gunfire, everyone is thinking of you, everyone is listening to you, even trying to guess at you from a short letter from home. Although people cannot see you, they all seem to be able to hear you. Because your rushing forward is shaking the hearts of your sons and daughters. You have made so many soldiers surprised and amazed when they received new guns and ammunition; you have made so many soldiers run around telling each other about your every achievement; and you have made so many soldiers, after reading a letter from home, keep a moving smile on their faces for many days in a row. Distant motherland, do you know, do you know how your rushing forward excites those sons and daughters who have taken up arms for you!
    When a certain company was conducting patriotic education, a soldier named Yang En-hua stood up and said: "Report to the instructor, I have two things to say to everyone!" After obtaining the instructor's permission, this soldier walked to the front of the company, took out two letters from home, and a photo. His eyes were filled with tears, and his voice was a little hoarse with emotion. He said: "This is a picture of my younger sister, do you think she is pretty?" Everyone looked, it was a young girl, really pretty, sturdy and good-looking, with bright eyes and two small braids, with two ribbons tied on the braids.
    "Comrades, but she wasn't like this before!" The comrades looked at him, and he thought and said: "She used to be a servant in the landlord's house, her whole body was covered with bruises, dragging a small, withered braid, her face yellow and inhuman. She would run home crying every two or three days to complain to me, but what could I do? My parents left the two of us, and I couldn't even support my own sister! We could only cry with grandma, cry with uncle, but they had no home or business, what could they do!" Speaking of this, his eyes were wet, and then tears rolled down, and he said: "I stomped my foot and left for so many years, who would have thought that my sister was still alive! ... But our motherland has changed, and our hometown has also changed. My sister said in her letter that a factory has been built near our hometown, and she is already a happy worker. My grandma and uncle have all been allocated land and have formed a mutual aid group, and maybe, in a few more years, a big tractor will be plowing our land with a 'woooo woooo' sound. She also said that I should resolutely fight at the front, and she would work hard in the rear, she also said that she wanted to compete with me, look at how happy she is in the picture!"
    The comrades all looked at the photo again, at the girl in the photo with ribbons tied on her braids. He said: "Comrades! Look how fat and healthy she is! She is no longer that servant girl with a withered braid! Comrades, we all say we love our motherland, I say I love my sister, I love my grandma, uncle, I love Chairman Mao, I love my good life, this is loving my motherland..." Speaking of this, he asked others as if asking himself: "It is because we love our motherland, comrades! When fighting a war, my legs can't help but want to rush forward; when doing work, I only feel that time is too short, the big sledgehammer seems to have become a wooden pestle, and the foot-and-a-half-long hoe has become a weaving shuttle. I don't feel tired even when I'm tired, and I don't feel tired even when I'm tired, the more I think about it, the happier I get, and the more I work, the more energetic I get, you just don't know how much energy this is!"
    This is the family change of an ordinary soldier, and it is also the family change of thousands of ordinary soldiers. The earth-shaking changes in the motherland in recent years have given people so much encouragement! If it is said that when our soldiers crossed the Yalu River, it was the inhumane destruction of Korea by the American beasts, the ruins, the blood and fire, that awakened people, angered people, and made them fight bravely to defend the motherland and aid the Korean people; then today, the soldiers have even more new and infinite strength, which is the construction of the motherland, the motherland becoming more and more beautiful day by day, and the new and enchanting scenery, which particularly attracts people, burning, really burning people's hearts!
    When the good news of the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway spread to the Korean battlefield, it particularly stirred up the Sichuan soldiers. Soldiers on the march performed Yangko dances, and soldiers on the front lines clapped their guns and sang the "Money Board" of their hometown. The home of soldier Yang Guoming is right next to the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, and he told people with even deeper emotion: There is a small river in front of his house. When he was a child, he would cut grass and firewood back and forth, and he would see two small wooden signs inserted on both sides of the river. He heard people say that this was the "Chengdu-Chongqing Road" to be built. But when he grew up, more than twenty years had passed, the small wooden signs had long rotted, and his father had been forced to repair the road and died of suffering, but he had never seen any "Chengdu-Chongqing Road". He said: "Who would have thought that the Chengdu-Chongqing Road would be opened to traffic in less than three years after liberation! I often dream of a sturdy and beautiful iron bridge over the small river in front of my house, and a train chugging smoke coming from the other side, and my mother is wearing new clothes watching the train!" Another Sichuan soldier named Li Zhixuan argued: "Isn't that right! I also had a dream. I dreamed that I got on the motherland's train, and I don't know how I twisted east and west and turned onto the Chengdu-Chongqing Road. When I saw it, it was really good! This Chengdu-Chongqing Road is even more beautiful than that railway. The train chugged along, and after a while, it stopped at a station forty miles from my home. Looking out from the train window, ha, it's changed! When I came out, this was still a desolate grassland, and the workers were clearing the grass there. How could it be that along the railway, a large area of three-story buildings of the same height! The factory chimneys are like small forests, all chugging smoke. There is also an airport over there, full of white fighter jets one after another. How beautiful my hometown has become! As I was watching, I heard someone call me: 'Hurry up and get to your post!' When I opened my eyes, it was our squad leader..."——This is a dream, it should be said that this is not a dream, this is the real beautiful scenery of the motherland that is moving forward. Our soldiers, even in their sleep after hard fighting, are thirsting to depict the beautiful scenery of their motherland, their hometown, now and in the future.
    One day, as I walked along the trench towards a certain company's position, I heard a heavy hammering sound coming from a row of caves in front of me, along with the "Hang Yu" "Hang Yu" shouts of labor. And I also heard two voices singing one after another:
    "I'll add a brick to it!"
    "I'll add a tile to it!"
    "I'll add a screw to it!"
    "I'll add a chimney to it!"
    Following the sound, I walked into a cave, and I saw two soldiers drilling holes in hard stone. One was holding a chisel, and the "tiger's mouth" on his hand was cracked, with blood seeping out of the cracks; the other was wielding a sledgehammer, sweat soaking through his shirt, and sweat dripping from his chin onto the ground. The pine wood "Mingzi" lit to save lamp oil had blackened their faces and bodies. It was the two of them who were shouting in low voices, one after the other.
    I said: "Comrades, where are you adding a brick and a tile?"
    "To Mao Zedong City!"
    "Mao Zedong City?"
    "Yes," the soldier wielding the sledgehammer put down the sledgehammer and wiped his sweat and said: "Comrade, haven't you heard that we are going to build a Mao Zedong City in our motherland. This city connects several cities together, covering an area of ​​several hundred miles. The chimneys of this city's factories will be like the forests on this mountain. The roads in this city are more than eighty meters wide, and forty cars can walk side by side. It's bigger than Beijing!"
    "No, forty-eight cars can walk side by side, and this city is ten times bigger than what you said!" The soldier holding the chisel corrected. The soldier holding the iron chisel looked at me with his bright eyes and continued: "Comrade, do you think it would be so good and beautiful if this Mao Zedong City were built? It may be a model for the construction of the motherland! How glorious it would be to put a brick and a tile on it! When we were hammering away, we were happy, and we felt like we were building Mao Zedong City. Think about it, we are fighting abroad, always thinking about the motherland, thinking about the motherland, isn't it just to build the motherland more beautifully, to build it like a big garden? Although we can't participate in the construction, we are here, killing one more enemy is equivalent to adding a screw to the motherland's factory; building one more fortification is equivalent to putting a brick on the motherland's building. So we sang like this!" After saying that, the young man took off his sweat-soaked shirt, wrung it out, took it to the entrance of the cave to shake it in the wind, put it on again, and shouted: "Buddy, let's do it!" He immediately raised the eight-pound sledgehammer again. … Motherland, can you tell me, how wide, how far, how beautiful is your future path! How much charm are you attracting people with!
    When the motherland's newly manufactured weapons arrived on the Korean front, it aroused even more joy and love among the people. A young division commander, upon hearing that the motherland-made recoilless guns had arrived, immediately shouted to the staff officer: "Quickly call and have them send one to me first so I can take a look." The recoilless gun was placed at his door, and people rarely saw him gently stroking the black and shiny gun body with such gentle movements, just like stroking his warhorse before. He lowered his head and looked at it for several minutes before personally putting on the gun cover and having it carried away. He also watched the gun go while muttering to himself: "If my Xiao Lingzi were still alive, if I gave him this gun, how many tanks couldn't he smash!..." People told me that Xiao Lingzi was a communications soldier who had been with him for several years. If he were still alive, he would be nineteen years old this year and was the youngest and most lovable communications soldier here. During the Fifth Battle, on one occasion, enemy tanks were about to climb to the division headquarters, and the guard platoon deployed to fight the tanks fiercely, but the firepower of all the machine guns and rifles could not stop the tanks from advancing. Xiao Lingzi became anxious when he saw this, and rushed up with two grenades, like a small swallow, he climbed to the top of the tank in one fell swoop. He first stuffed the grenades into the tracks, the grenades rolled off, and he was also injured. With blood flowing on his face, he went to uncover the tank's hatch, trying to throw the grenade in, but he couldn't open it no matter what. According to the division commander, he later told people that at that time, he looked at his Xiao Lingzi and wished he could bite open the hatch for him so that he could throw the grenade in. … Later, the hatch was opened from the inside, and a pistol was extended, firing several shots at Xiao Lingzi's chest. Xiao Lingzi, with several bullets in his chest, stubbornly stuffed the grenade in, the tank was destroyed, but Xiao Lingzi also fell on that tank. —I, I then understood: how the motherland's manufactured, such good recoilless guns, touched the emotions of our division commander today. When I talked to the division commander about this, the division commander sighed and said: "I am more than thirty years old this year, and the war life occupies half of my age. In these years of war, I dare to say that no matter which enemy, in terms of bravery, in terms of enduring hardship, in terms of accepting combat experience, they cannot be compared to us, they cannot catch up with us. The American devils are even much worse. But we lack one thing, which is the lack of modern equipment. If such an army, such soldiers as Xiao Lingzi, plus sufficient modern equipment, you cannot imagine how powerful he would be! How many soldiers said this, they said, not to mention having equipment that exceeds the enemy, if we have equipment that is similar to the enemy's, we can give him a specified date and let him roll into the sea." He paused and continued: "Conversely, isn't it like this! The reason why the enemy still dares to be so fierce and unreasonable, isn't it precisely because we don't have a strong industry and fully modern equipment, and he feels that we are not as good as him in this regard? … But now the construction of the motherland is so fast, large-scale economic construction is about to begin, when I receive a gun, even a pistol, I feel so cute. This is not a gun, a pistol, this is our entire motherland moving forward towards a new history! This is a new guarantee force for peace in Asia and the whole world!"
    A few days later, one evening, I went to see our division commander again. In the light, he was supporting his cheeks and smiling, listening to the staff officer report on the results of the initial test of the recoilless guns. In this day's fierce anti-tank battle, eighteen of the more than thirty tanks dispatched by the enemy were destroyed. The staff officer also excitedly said that one of the gunners destroyed five tanks by himself. According to the company's report, just as the soldier was preparing to fire the gun, several tank shells landed near him, and he was wounded and fell into the trench. At this time, he stood up holding the tripod of the recoilless gun, looked at his recoilless gun, and whispered to his wounded partner: "This gun was made for us by the old workers of the motherland, can we just go down casually without hitting a tank? No! In this way, we are sorry for those worker comrades!" Those five tanks were destroyed by him in this way, with the injury, with blood flowing down his sleeves, without even tying it up. Afterwards, the instructor asked him to fill out a meritorious service report, he said: "Instructor, you shouldn't give me a meritorious service first, you should give them a meritorious service first!" The instructor said: "Who are you talking about giving a meritorious service to?" He said: "Who? Give it to the old worker comrades who made this gun! At least, this credit should be half theirs and half mine." Afterwards, this soldier kept asking where the gun was made, and he wanted to write a letter to thank him. The division commander couldn't help laughing when he heard this, nodded and said: "Is this gun made by one person? We should thank all the old worker comrades of the motherland, we must thank them very much, in the future they will give our little tigers wings one by one!"
    Friends of the motherland, fathers and elders of the motherland! From summer to autumn, from autumn to winter, I met thousands of soldiers on the Korean battlefield, and they all asked me to tell you: how grateful they are to you. When the Imjin River had not yet thawed, they sent single clothes, and as soon as the autumn wind started to blow, they received warm winter clothes. The old mothers with white hair shed tears of gratitude and offered their savings of many years; the children who had just learned to write wrote letters, calling them Volunteer Army uncles, which was so touching. Moreover, what they are particularly grateful for is that in the two years they have been abroad—only two years—the motherland, their homes, have been built so beautifully. They know that you are working hard. They know how hard you are working by the machines, in the mines, in the fields, in the forests, in the sparsely populated barren mountains and ridges. Therefore, they also know how precious the beautiful scenery unfolded in your hands is. They know what to use to defend it, and what is worth defending it. They also want me to tell you that they have no more unexpected demands on the motherland, but are concerned about the motherland's production and construction. If you believe that your sons are brave, please rest assured, use as much strength as you can to build, they must guard the underground Great Wall on the 38th parallel well, and they must make this underground Great Wall as iron-like. They frankly call themselves "sentries on the 38th parallel", they want to stand guard for the motherland, stand guard for Korea, stand guard for Asia, stand guard for the whole world, resolutely strive for the complete liberation of the Korean people, resolutely defend the lasting peace of Asia and the whole world, they must perfectly fulfill the responsibility of this sentry. Moreover, they will not relax for a minute or a second to force the enemy, squeeze the enemy, torment the enemy, and strive to push the position forward. They know: pushing it forward an inch, the war and disaster will be an inch further away from the motherland; pushing up a mountain, the Korean people will have one more arable mountain, one more happy mountain; the sound of artillery on the 38th parallel will be further away from our happy children, singing machines, and lush crops. Fathers and elders of the motherland, you love your children so much, if you want to know the voice of the Volunteer Army, the wishes of the Volunteer Army, this is their voice, their wishes!
    Motherland, motherland led by our infallible leader, motherland where our 500 million patriotic hearts are burning and boiling, your large-scale economic construction is about to begin, you will be more and more lovable day by day, more and more lovable moment by moment, no one knows how much power you actually contain, no one knows how beautiful, broad, and vast your future actually is. To be loyal to such a motherland, to be loyal to such a heroic and righteous motherland that aids Korea, is so pleasant, so elated, even if blood is smeared on the ground, it is so glorious. Friends, friends of the motherland, our leader's loud call is ringing in our ears, and the time won by the soldiers with blood and life is so precious, when the signal for this great construction is launched, how will you greet our motherland's new historical task! … Friends, from the motherland to Korea, I see one side is a hot and enthusiastic construction, and the other side is a selfless battle in the midst of artillery fire, like two battlefields advancing side by side. Let these two battlefields encourage each other and compete with each other, and jointly push our motherland forward. The sons and daughters in Korea will resolutely defend our neighbor Korea, defend the motherland, defend world peace; and will dedicate constant victories to the people of the motherland. The people of the motherland, especially the worker comrades, please also use a garden-like beautiful motherland to welcome the victorious soldiers one morning!

    前进吧，祖国！
    魏巍
    炮火声里，雪花又落遍了朝鲜。这是朝鲜战争的第三个年头。朋友，你们一定很羡慕我，在这里，我又看到了我们可爱的战士们。他们，离开可爱的祖国已经两年了。这两年中，他们付出了多大的辛苦呵。两年的时间不算很长，可是我看见许多的指挥员，他们的额上添了绉纹，有的人鬓角上添了几丝白发。战士们，千千万万的战士们，他们的双手都磨起了厚厚的血茧。他们就是这样用自己的双手，劈开了、掏通了从东海岸到西海岸的丛山大岭，联成密如蛛网般的地下长城。他们就站在这道长城上，打击着、折磨着那些还没有斩尽杀绝的野兽；也是在这道长城上，他们回头望望北方——那是自己的祖国。
    祖国——对于一个离开两年的战士，是多么地叫人神往呵。谈起祖国，当然，他们在怀念着自己的母亲、怀念着自己的妻子和朋友；可是他们却更忘情地谈着一件事，人人都在谈着，处处都在谈着，在那所有的弯弯曲曲盖满硝烟的战壕里，都在谈着一件事——祖国的建设。你可以看见，在许多指挥员的房子里，在插着一束野花的瓶子旁边，挨着他们的军事地图，贴着郝建秀的彩色照片，还有从报刊上剪下来的，治淮工程的照片，成渝铁路通车的照片，近代化铁路、工厂的照片。在战士们的掩蔽部里，也贴着这些画片：有许许多多微笑的孩子，也有第一次出现在祖国集体农庄的拖拉机，还有突突地冒烟的工厂。就是那些为了祖国为了和平事业而光荣牺牲的人们，他们的身边，也有着跟决心书一起被鲜血染湿的说明祖国前进的照片呵。
    祖国在前进。祖国一日千里的建设，是多么地激动着为它战斗在国外的儿女们。祖国呵，在炮火弥天的战线上，人人都在想着你，人人都在听着你，甚至从一封短短的家信里去猜着你。人们虽然望不见你，可是都像能听到你一样。因为你奔腾前进的脚步，是震动着你们的儿女们的心呵。你使得多少战士，在接到新的枪枝、炮弹的时候，惊奇着、赞叹着；你使得多少战士，为你的每一个成就奔走相告；你又使得多少战士，在低吟着家信之后，一连许多天，脸上都保持着动人的笑容呵。遥远的祖国呵，你知道吗，你知道你的奔腾前进，是怎样地激动着那些为了你拿起枪来的儿女们！
    某个连队进行爱国教育的时候，有一个叫杨恩华的战士站起来说：“报告指导员，我有两句话跟大家说一说吧！”这个战士得到指导员的允许后，就走到队前，从口袋里掏出了两封家信，还有一张照片。他眼里含着泪圈，激动得声音都有些嘶哑了。他说：“这是我妹妹的像片，你们看好不好呢？”大家一看，这是个年轻的女孩子，真好呵，又壮实又好看，一双明亮的大眼，梳着两个小辫，小辫上还结着两个蝴蝶哩。
    “同志们，可是她从前不是这样的呀！”同志们望着他，他边想边说：“她以前给地主家当丫头，浑身上下给打的是青一道紫一道的，拖着一个小干巴辫子，脸黄黄的不像人样。她三天两天哭着跑回家来，找我诉苦，我有什么办法呢？爹娘撇下了我们俩，我连我的妹妹都养活不了！我们只有守着奶奶去哭，守着叔叔去哭，可是他们没家没业的，又有什么办法呢！”说到这里，他的眼睛潮湿了，接着泪珠滚了下来，又说：“我一跺脚出来这多年了，谁还想到我的妹妹还活着呢！……可是我们的祖国变啦，家乡也变啦，我妹妹的信上说，靠近我们家乡，工厂建设起来啦，她已经是一个幸福的工人。我奶奶和叔叔都分得了土地，成立了互助组，说不定，再有上几年大拖拉机也在我们那里呜噜呜噜地耕种啦。她还说，要我坚决在前面打，她在后边努力建设，她还说要跟我比赛哩，你们看看像片上她那样乐呵呵的样儿！”
    同志们又一齐望着照片，望着照片上那个发辫上结着蝴蝶的女孩子。他说：“同志们！你看她多胖多健康呵！她再不是那个拖着干巴小辫的丫头啦！同志们，我们都说爱祖国，我说我爱我的妹妹，爱我的奶奶，叔叔，爱毛主席，爱我的好日子，这就是爱我的祖国呀……”说到这里，他又像询问别人似地说：“就是因为爱我们的祖国吧，同志们！打起仗来，我两条腿不由得就要往前钻；干起活来，只嫌时间短，大铁锤似乎变成了木?瘩，尺半长的大镢头变成了织布梭。就这样困也不觉困，累也不觉累，越想越高兴，越干越有劲，你就不知道这股劲头有多大！”
    这是一个普通战士的家庭变化，也是万千个普通战士的家庭变化。祖国近年来天翻地覆的变化，给人多大鼓舞呵！如果说，当我们的战士跨过鸭绿江的时候，是美国野兽们对朝鲜残无人道的摧残，是那些废墟，是那些血和火，惊醒着人们，激怒着人们，为保卫祖国、为援助朝鲜人民，奋不顾身地战斗；那么在今天，战士们的浑身就更增加了新的无穷的力量，就是祖国的建设，祖国一天比一天的美好，以及新的迷人的美景，格外地吸引着人们，燃烧着，真的是燃烧着人们的心！
    当成渝铁路通车的喜讯，传到了朝鲜战场，特别使得四川籍的战士们轰动了。正在行军中的战士扭起了秧歌舞，阵地上的战士，拍着他们怀里的枪枝唱起了家乡的“金钱板”。战士杨国明的家紧挨着成渝路，他更以深沉的感情告诉人们：他家的门前有一条小河，小时候打草打柴过来过去，就看见河两边插着两个小木牌，听人讲，这就是要修的“成渝路”。可是等到自己长大了，二十多年了，小木牌早已烂掉了，父亲也被迫着修路受难死了，可也从没有看到什么样的“成渝路”。他说：“谁会想到，解放不到三年，成渝路就通车了呢！我现在常常梦见家门前的小河上，架了一座又结实又漂亮的铁桥，火车冒着烟嘟嘟地从那边过来了，我的母亲正穿着新衣裳看火车呢！”另一个叫李志轩的四川籍战士挣嘴说：“可不是吗！我也做过一个梦。梦见坐上了祖国的火车，不知道怎么东扭达西扭达地就拐到成渝路上。我一看，真好呵！这成渝路真比那条铁路都漂亮。火车嘟嘟走着，一走就走到离我家四十里的车站停下了。从车窗里向外一望，哈，变啦！我出来的时候，这儿还是一片荒凉的草地，工人们正在那里铲草，怎么沿着铁路一大片一大片全是一般般高的三层楼房呢！工厂的烟囱像小树林子似的，全突突地冒着烟。那边还有一个飞机场，一个挨着一个停满了白晃晃的战斗机。我的家乡变得多美呀！我正在望着望着，就听有人喊我：‘快上岗吧！’我睁眼一看，原是我们班长。……”——这是一个梦，应该说这不是一个梦，这是祖国正在前进的真正美景。我们的战士，就是在艰苦战斗以后的睡梦里，也在渴想着描画他们的祖国，他的家乡现在的、未来的美景。
    某天，当我沿着交通壕走向某连阵地的时候，听见前面一排洞子里，传出来一片沉重的锤声，跟那“杭育”“杭育”的劳动的呼喊。而且还听到有两个声音在一替一句喝唱着：
    “我给它加一块砖！”
    “我给它加一块瓦！”
    “我给它再加一个螺丝！”
    “我给它再加一个烟筒！”
    我顺着这声音，走到一个洞里，只见有两个战士正在坚石上打眼。一个掌着焊子，他手上的“虎口”被震裂了，裂纹里浸着血；另一个抡着铁锤，汗水湿透了衬衣，下巴上的汗珠噗噗地落到地上。为了节省灯油点起的松木“明子”，把他们的脸上、身上薰得乌黑。就是他们俩一递一句地低声喊着。
    我说：“同志们，你们给什么地方加一块砖、一块瓦呀？”
    “给毛泽东城！”
    “毛泽东城？”
    “是呀，”抡铁锤的战士收了铁锤，擦了擦汗说：“同志，你没听说吗，在我们祖国要修一座毛泽东城。这座城，把几个城市连在一起，方圆好几百里。这座城，工厂的烟囱要像这山上的树林一样。这座城的马路有八十多公尺宽，能并排走下四十辆汽车。比北京还要大！”
    “不，能并排走四十八辆汽车，这个城也要比你说的大十倍哩！”掌焊子的战士纠正地说。拿铁焊的战士用他一双充满光采的眼睛望着我，继续说：“同志，你说这座毛泽东城修起来该多好、多美呵，他也许是祖国建设的模范！能够给他放一块砖，添一块瓦是多么光荣！我们俩叮叮当当地打着、打着，高兴起来啦，就觉着自己是在那儿修毛泽东城一样。你想想我们出国作战，时时想着祖国，念着祖国，还不是为了把祖国建设得更美，建设得像大花园一样么？我们虽然不能去参加建设，可是我们在这儿，多杀死一个敌人，也等于给祖国的工厂增加一个螺丝；多筑一道工事，也就等于给祖国的大楼上放上一块砖瓦。所以我们俩就吆吆喝喝地唱起来啦！”说过，小伙子把汗水湿透的衬衣一脱，两手一拧，拿到洞口迎风一抖，又穿起来，一边喊：“伙计，干吧！”马上又举起了那个八磅重的大铁锤。……祖国呵，你能告诉我吗，你的未来的道路究竟有多宽、多远、多美呵！你是以多大的魅力在吸引人们！
    当祖国新造的武器到达朝鲜前线的时候，更引起人们的欢喜和疼爱。一个年轻的师长，一听到祖国造的无座力炮来到了，就马上喊参谋：“快打电话，让他们先送一门来我看看。”无座力炮，架在他的门口，人们很少能看见他用这么轻柔的动作抚摩着那乌亮乌亮的炮身，像以前抚摩他的战马一样。他低着头，足足看了有好几分钟，才又亲手给它穿上炮衣，让人抬走。还一边眼送着那门炮自言自语地说：“如果我的小玲子还活着，我发给他这门炮，有多少坦克敲不烂它！……”人们告诉我，小玲子是跟了他好几年的通讯员，如果活着，今年是十九岁了，是这里通讯员里最小最逗人爱的一个。五次战役当中，有一次，敌人的坦克快爬到师指挥所，警卫排布置开向坦克猛打，但机枪、步枪所有的火力，都挡不住坦克的前进。小玲子一看急了，就提着两个手榴弹冲了上去，像小燕子似的，一下子就爬到了坦克顶上。他先往履带上塞手榴弹，手榴弹滚掉了，把他也炸伤了。他脸上流着血，又去揭坦克的盖子，想把手榴弹投进去，可是怎么也揭不开。据师长后来告诉人，他那时候，看着他的小玲子，恨不得替他咬开盖子，让他把手榴弹投进去。……后来，盖子从里面打开了，伸出了一支手枪，对着小玲子的胸脯乒乓就是几枪，小玲子是胸脯上带着好几粒子弹硬把手榴弹填进去的，坦克炸毁了，可是小玲子也躺倒在那辆坦克上。——我，我这才明白：今天祖国造的、这么好的无座力炮，是怎样地牵动了我们这位师长的感情。当我跟师长谈起这事，师长感叹地说：“我今年三十多岁了，战争生活占了我年龄的一半。在这多年的战争里，我敢这样说，无论那一个敌人，在勇敢上，在吃苦上，在接受作战经验上，都不能比得过我们，赶得上我们。美国鬼子更加差得多。可是我们却少一条，就是缺少近代化的装备。假若这样的一支军队，像小玲子这样的战士，加上充分的近代化装备，你不能想像他是多么的强大！有多少战士这样讲呵，他们说，不要说有超过敌人的装备，如果我们有跟敌人差不多的装备，我们可以给他指定日子让他滚到大海里去。”他停了停，又继续说：“反过来说，不也是这样的吗！敌人所以还敢这样逞凶耍赖，难道不正是因为我们还没有强大的工业，充分现代化装备，他觉得我们在这一点上还不如他吗？……可是现在祖国的建设是多么快呵，大规模的经济建设就要开始了，当我接到一门炮，即使一支手枪也好，我也觉得那么可爱。这不是一门炮、一支手枪，这是我们整个的祖国向着新的历史前进呵！这是亚洲和全世界和平新的保证力量呵！”
    隔了些日子，在一个晚上，我又去见我们的师长。在灯光下，他正支着腮微笑着，听参谋报告无座力炮初试锋芒的战果。这一天激烈的反坦克战，把敌人出动的三十多辆坦克，击毁了十八辆。参谋还兴奋地说，其中有一个炮手，他自己一个人就击毁了五辆。据连里报告，在这个战士刚准备开炮的时候，接连好几发坦克炮弹落在他的附近，就把他打得负了伤歪倒在战壕里。这时候，他手扶着无座力炮的脚架站起身子，又望着自己的无座力炮，低声唤着也已负伤的伙伴：“这是祖国的工人老大哥给我们造的这门炮呀，难道我们还没打住一辆坦克，就随随便便地下去吗？不能！这样，我们对不起那些工人同志们！”那五辆坦克，就是被他这样带着伤，血顺着袖子流着，连绑扎也没有绑扎的时候接连击毁的。事后，指导员找他去填立功喜报，他说：“指导员，你不该先给我立功，你该先给他们立功！”指导员说：“你说的是给谁立功呢？”他说：“给谁？给造这门炮的工人老大哥！起码，这个功劳应该他占一半，我占一半。”过后这个战士还一直打听这门炮是那里造的，他想写信去感谢他。师长听到这里，不由得笑了起来，点着头说：“难道这炮是一个人造的吗？我们应该感谢祖国所有的工人老大哥们，我们要十分感谢他们，将来他们会把我们的这些小老虎子，一个个都给插起翅膀来的！”
    祖国的朋友们，祖国的父老们！从夏天到秋天，从秋天到冬天，我在朝鲜战场上遇到千万战士，都让我转告你们：他们对你们是多么的感激。临津江还没有解冻的时候，就送来了单衣，秋风刚刚吹起，又收到暖暖的冬装。白发苍苍的老妈妈含着热泪献出了多年的积蓄；刚会写信的孩子，一口一声志愿军叔叔，这是多么地叫人动心呵。而且，他们特别感激的是，你们在他们出国的两年间——只两年呵，把祖国，把他们的家园建设得这么美好。他们知道你们是辛苦的。他们知道你们在机器旁，在矿井里，在田野上，在森林中，在人烟稀少的荒山大岭是多么地辛勤劳苦。因此，他们也知道，在你们的双手上展开的美景，是多么的可贵。他们知道需要用什么去保卫，值得用什么去保卫。他们还要我转告你们，他们对祖国再没有什么令人猜不到的要求，只是挂心着祖国的生产建设。如果你们相信你们的儿子是英勇的话，请你们放心吧，能用多大的力气就用多大的力气去建设吧，他们一定要把三八线上的地下长城守好，而且要把这个地下长城变得像铁的一样。他们直率地自称是“三八线上的哨兵”，他们要给祖国站岗，给朝鲜站岗，给亚洲站岗，给全世界站岗，坚决争取朝鲜人民的完全解放，坚决保卫亚洲和全世界的持久和平，他们一定要圆满地完成这个哨兵的责任。而且他们将不放松一分钟一秒钟的时间去逼敌人，挤敌人，折磨敌人，努力地把阵地推向前去，他们知道：多推一寸，战争和灾难就离祖国远一寸；多推一个山头，朝鲜人民就多一个可耕种的山头，多一个幸福的山头；三八线上的炮声，就离我们幸福的孩子，歌唱的机器，茂盛的庄稼更远。祖国的父老们，你们是这样热爱你们的孩子呵，假若你们愿意知道志愿军的声音，志愿军的心愿，这就是他们的声音，他们的心愿！
    祖国，我们万无一失的领袖引导着的祖国呵，我们五万万颗爱国心燃烧着、沸腾着的祖国呵，你的大规模的经济建设就要开始了，你将一天比一天可爱，一刻比一刻可爱，没有人知道你究竟蕴藏着多大的力量，没有人知道你的前途究竟是多么美丽、广阔和辽远。为这样的祖国效忠，为这样英勇仗义援助朝鲜的祖国效忠，是多么的愉快，多么的扬眉吐气，即使鲜血涂地也是多么的光荣呵。朋友们，祖国的朋友们，我们领袖的洪亮的号召，在我们的耳边响着，战士们用鲜血和生命争取的时间，又是这么宝贵，在这伟大建设的信号发起的时候，你是怎样地去迎接我们祖国的新的历史任务呢！……朋友们，从祖国到朝鲜，我看见一面是热火朝天的建设，一面是在炮火弥天中奋不顾身的战斗，好像两个齐头并进的战场一样。让这两个战场相互鼓励也相互比赛，共同地把我们的祖国推向前进吧。在朝鲜的儿女们，必将坚决保卫我们邻邦朝鲜、保卫祖国、保卫全世界和平；必将以不断的胜利，奉献给祖国的人民。祖国的人民，特别是工人同志们，也请你们用花园一样美丽的祖国，来迎接有一天早晨胜利凯旋的战士们！
