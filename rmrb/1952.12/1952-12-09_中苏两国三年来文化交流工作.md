Cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union has greatly developed over the past three years, effectively enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. On the first day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific delegation headed by Soviet writers Fadeyev and Simonov visited our country. Subsequently, Soviet writers Ehrenburg, Gonchar, Kozhevnikov, and others came to China and exchanged experiences in literary creation with Chinese writers. Recently, a Soviet cultural workers delegation headed by Tikhonov, a Soviet art troupe led by Chulaki, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble led by B.A. Alexandrov, and a Soviet film artists delegation led by Fedorov were invited to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Chinese writers Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ding Ling, Xiao San, and a Chinese writers delegation headed by Feng Xuefeng have also visited the Soviet Union and were warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. Close ties have also been established between the scientific communities of China and the Soviet Union, and scientific exchanges are frequently conducted. The Soviet Academy of Sciences maintains regular contact with more than 50 scientific institutions in China. Chinese and Soviet scientists often correspond, exchange research insights, and discuss academic issues. Yudin, Doctor of Philosophy, Nuzhdin, Doctor of Biology, Giselev, Doctor of History, Makarova and Baudlev, Master of Economics, Chesnokov, Deputy Director of the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Askarov, Deputy Director of the Law Department of Moscow University, and others have been invited to China, and Chinese scientists often visit the Soviet Union. On October 3 this year, the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences passed a resolution on creative cooperation with Chinese scientists. The resolution stipulates that the most interesting works of Chinese scientists should be translated into Russian and published. The Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will be responsible for translating and annotating the works of Chinese scientists. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also passed a resolution to strengthen ties with the Soviet Academy of Sciences and accelerate learning from them.

There has been a significant exchange of books and periodicals between China and the Soviet Union in the past three years, which has been welcomed by the broad masses of people in both countries. According to incomplete statistics from the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government, about 3,131 Chinese translations of Soviet books have been published nationwide in the past three years. The People's Publishing House published more than 12,166,100 copies of Chinese translations of Soviet books from February 1949 to September 1952, including 2,722,500 copies of the works of Lenin and Stalin. On May 15 this year, the Soviet Foreign Literature Publishing House published the Russian translation of Volume I of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Prior to this, Chairman Mao's "On Practice" had already been published in the Soviet "Bolshevik" magazine and printed as a separate booklet by the Soviet State Political Books Publishing House in multiple editions. Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism" and works on modern and contemporary Chinese history have also been translated into Russian.

Literary classics of China and the Soviet Union have become favorite reading materials for the broad masses of people in both countries. According to incomplete statistics, 665 Chinese translations of Soviet literature and art books have been published in China in the past three years. As many as 150 separate editions of Gorky's works have been translated into Chinese. Most of the literary works that have won the Stalin Prize over the years have been translated into Chinese. Works such as Serafimovich's "Iron Flood" and Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" have popular, abridged editions adapted to different levels of education, enabling them to be widely disseminated. Simonov's "Days and Nights," Furmanov's "Chapayev," and Wasilewska's "The Rainbow" have been made into comic books by Chinese artists. Countless Chinese youths take Paul Kochakin, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, and Matrosov as examples to learn from. The works of Chinese revolutionary writers are also being widely introduced in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has published 118 books by Chinese writers in 16 national languages, with a total circulation of 4.62 million copies. These works reflect the revolutionary struggles and lives of the Chinese people in various periods. Many of Lu Xun's works have been translated and published in 13 Soviet national languages. New editions of Guo Moruo and Mao Dun's works have been published in the Soviet Union. In March this year, Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River," Zhou Libo's "Hurricane," and He Jingzhi and Ding Yi's "The White-Haired Girl" won the 1951 Stalin Literature and Art Prize, which is a major event of profound significance in Sino-Soviet cultural exchange.

China and the Soviet Union have also conducted a large number of exchanges in film, drama, and music. In the past three years, more than 200 Soviet films have been screened in China, of which more than 140 have been translated into Chinese. According to incomplete statistics, from 1949 to June this year, the audience was more than 186,026,000. Soviet film artists also cooperated with Chinese film artists to produce three color films: "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Liberated China," and "The Beautiful Land." The first two films won the Stalin Prize. Only five films from New China, "Daughters of China," "Boundless Radiance," "The Invisible Front," "The Victory of the Chinese People," and "Liberated China," were screened in various parts of the Soviet Union from August 1950 to April 1, 1951, with an audience of more than 20 million. In the autumn of 1951, the "Chinese Film Festival" was also held in 30 major cities in the Soviet Union. Soviet scripts translated into Chinese and staged in major cities in China include "The Russian Question," "Moscow Character," "Red Scarf," "The Voice of the American People," "Forward, American People," "Cold War," and "Dawn Shines on Moscow." "Dawn Shines on Moscow" enabled the audience to specifically recognize the glorious prospects of communist society, which is of great educational significance to the Chinese people who are about to begin large-scale construction. "The White-Haired Girl" has been translated into Russian, directed by the famous playwright Gerasimov, and began performing at the Vakhtangov Theater in Moscow on June 13 this year. In the past three years, Chinese musicians have done a lot of work in introducing and playing Russian and Soviet musical works. The National Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Central People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a national regular Soviet music broadcast appreciation meeting, which systematically introduced Soviet classical music and modern music. Taking Hankou as an example, dozens of members of cultural and art troupes and school teachers and students regularly and systematically listened to it. The music of New China is also being widely introduced in the Soviet Union. The Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers held a "Chinese Music Week" in July this year to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the death of Chinese composer Nie Er and to introduce Chinese songs, broadcasting the works of Chinese composers.

In addition, China and the Soviet Union have achieved great success in cultural exchanges through exhibitions in the past three years. The larger exhibitions introducing the Soviet Union held domestically by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association include: the Soviet Construction Picture Exhibition, the Stalin 70th Birthday Exhibition, the Lenin's Life and Career Exhibition, the Soviet Propaganda Painting and Satirical Painting Exhibition, etc. As for the small-scale Soviet picture exhibitions held by local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations, they are almost continuously exhibited in schools, factories, and streets. In October 1950, the Art Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers hosted the "Chinese Art Exhibition" in the famous State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. During the exhibition period, the exhibition hall of the art gallery was often crowded, and there was a long line waiting outside the door before it opened in the morning. The State Museum of Oriental Culture in Moscow holds a permanent Chinese art exhibition. Many cities and villages in the Soviet Union are systematically holding exhibitions on People's China, and the number of visitors is very enthusiastic. With the help of Soviet experts, China established the China People's University and the Harbin Institute of Technology, which are specifically aimed at learning from the Soviet Union's construction experience. In order to learn more directly from the Soviet Union's construction experience, China sent its first batch of students to study in the Soviet Union in August last year. Throughout the country, learning Russian has become a hot trend. In Tsinghua University in Beijing, gray-haired old professors also bury their heads in learning with young students in order to master this tool for learning socialist culture.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" held in our country from November 7 to December 6 this year, cultural exchange and cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union have been unprecedentedly strengthened and developed. The great Soviet people sent a cultural mission of 300 people—the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, the Soviet Art Troupe, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Soviet Film Artists Delegation to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in our country. They have successively visited major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Shenyang, and Changchun, and introduced to the broad masses of people and cultural, artistic, and scientific workers in our country the advanced experience and great achievements of the Soviet Union in science, agriculture, biology, literature, film, drama, music, dance, and socialist and communist construction. As of December 3, according to incomplete statistics: the Soviet cultural, scientific, and artistic workers who came to our country this time have given 37 special reports and participated in 69 symposiums in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in various parts of our country. Hundreds of thousands of cultural, scientific, and artistic workers in our country participated in the reports and symposiums. At the same time, famous Soviet artists also formally performed more than 50 times in various parts of our country, with an audience of about 290,000 people. In addition, 16 million people organized listened to their singing from the radio. These reports, speeches, and performances have been of great help to our country's cultural and artistic work. Their visit has made the broad masses of people in our country more clearly aware of the important significance of learning from the Soviet Union. While our country held the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," exhibitions and lectures on New China were held in Moscow, Leningrad, and urban and rural areas of the Soviet republics, and Chinese and related art programs were performed, and Chinese films were screened, enabling millions of Soviet people to understand the cultural achievements of the Chinese people.

In the great work of cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union in the past three years, the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries has played an outstanding organizational role.

    中苏两国三年来文化交流工作
    中苏两国文化交流三年来有很大发展，有效地增进着两国人民的相互了解和友谊。在中华人民共和国成立的第一天，以苏联名作家法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫为首的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团即来我国访问。接着，苏联名作家爱伦堡、冈查尔、科热夫尼科夫等，又先后来中国和中国作家亲切地交流了两国文学创作的经验。最近，以吉洪诺夫为首的苏联文化工作者代表团、由楚拉基领导的苏联艺术工作团、以鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫为首的苏军红旗歌舞团和以费道罗夫为首的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团，又应邀来我国参加“中苏友好月”。中国作家郭沫若、茅盾、丁玲、萧三等以及以冯雪峰为首的中国作家赴苏访问团，也曾先后访问苏联，受到苏联人民的热烈欢迎。中苏两国科学界也已建立起了密切的联系，经常进行科学交流的工作。苏联科学院和中国五十多个科学机构保持经常的联系。中国和苏联的科学家时常通信，交换研究心得，讨论学术问题。苏联著名哲学博士尤金，生物学博士努日金，史学博士吉谢烈夫，经济学硕士马卡洛娃、包德列夫，苏联科学院哲学研究所副所长车斯诺柯夫，莫斯科大学法学系副主任阿斯凯洛夫等都应邀到过中国，中国的科学家也常常到苏联访问。今年十月三日，苏联科学院主席团通过关于和中国科学家实行创造性的合作的决议。决议中规定把中国科学家的最饶有兴趣的著作翻译成俄文出版。苏联科学院所属的东方学研究所将负责翻译和注释中国科学家的著作。我国科学院院长会议也作出决议，以加强与苏联科学院的联系，并加紧向他们学习。
    中苏两国的书刊三年来已有很大的交流，受到两国广大人民群众的欢迎。据中央人民政府出版总署不完全统计，三年来全国出版的苏联书籍的中译本共约三千一百三十一种。人民出版社从一九四九年二月到一九五二年九月止，所出版的苏联书籍中译本就有一千二百十六万六千一百多册，其中列宁、斯大林的著作共二百七十二万二千五百册。今年五月十五日，苏联外国作品出版局出版了“毛泽东选集”第一卷俄文译本。在此以前，毛主席的“实践论”早已在苏联“布尔什维克”杂志上刊载，并由苏联国立政治书籍出版局一版再版地印成单行本。刘少奇的“论国际主义与民族主义”以及中国近代史和现代史等，都已有了俄文译本。
    中苏两国的文学名著，成为两国广大人民群众喜爱的读物。据不完全统计，我国三年来出版的苏联文学艺术书籍的中译本有六百六十五种。高尔基的作品译成中文的单行本达一百五十种之多。历年荣获斯大林奖金的文学作品，多数已有中文译本。绥拉菲莫维奇的“铁流”、奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等作品，都有适应不同文化程度的通俗的节印本，使它们能普及地流传。西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”、富曼诺夫的“夏伯阳”、华西列夫斯卡的“虹”，都被中国美术家绘成了连环画本。无数中国青年以保尔·柯察金、丹娘、马特洛索夫为自己学习的榜样。中国革命作家的作品在苏联也被广泛地介绍着。苏联以十六种民族文字出版了中国作家的一百一十八种书籍，共已发行了四百六十二万册。这些作品反映了各个时期的中国人民的革命斗争和中国人民生活。鲁迅的许多作品已被译成十三种苏联民族文字出版。郭沫若、茅盾的作品在苏联又有了新的版本。今年三月，丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”、周立波的“暴风骤雨”、贺敬之和丁毅执笔的“白毛女”，都荣获一九五一年斯大林文艺奖金，这是中苏文化交流上有深刻意义的一件大事。
    中苏两国在电影、戏剧、音乐方面也进行了大量交流。三年来，苏联电影在中国上映的已有二百多部，其中译成华语的有一百四十多部。据不完全的统计，从一九四九年到今年六月，观众有一亿八千六百零二万六千多人。苏联电影艺术工作者还与我国电影艺术工作者合作摄制成“中国人民的胜利”、
    “解放了的中国”、“锦绣河山”三部五彩影片。前两部影片荣获了斯大林奖金。新中国的影片仅
    “中华女儿”、“光芒万丈”、“无形的战线”、
    “中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”五片，从一九五零年八月到一九五一年四月一日在苏联各地放映，观众就有两千万人以上。一九五一年秋，苏联三十个大城市还举办了“中国电影节”。苏联剧本译成中文在中国各大城市上演的，已有“俄罗斯问题”、“莫斯科性格”、“红领巾”、“美国人民的呼声”、“前进，美国的人民”、“冷战”、“曙光照耀着莫斯科”等。“曙光照耀着莫斯科”使观众具体地认识到共产主义社会的光辉远景，这对即将开始大规模建设的中国人民是有莫大的教育意义的。“白毛女”一剧已有俄文译本，由名戏剧家格拉西莫夫导演，今年六月十三日在莫斯科瓦赫坦戈夫剧院开始上演。三年来，中国的音乐工作者在介绍和演奏俄罗斯和苏联的音乐作品方面曾做了许多工作。中苏友好协会总会和中央人民广播电台联合举办全国性的定期的苏联音乐广播欣赏会，有系统地介绍了苏联的古典音乐和现代音乐，听众仅以汉口一地来说，已有几十个文工团团员和学校师生经常有组织地收听。新中国的音乐在苏联也被广泛地介绍着。苏联部长会议无线电广播委员会为纪念我国作曲家聂耳逝世十七周年和介绍中国歌曲，曾在今年七月举行了“中国音乐周”，广播我国作曲家的作品。
    此外，中苏两国三年来通过展览会进行文化交流也有很大成绩。中苏友好协会总会在国内举办的较大型的介绍苏联的展览会有：苏联建设图片展览会、斯大林七十寿辰展览会、列宁生平事业展览会、苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览等。至于各地中苏友好协会举办的小型苏联图片展览，几乎是继续不断地在学校、工厂、街头展出。一九五零年十月，苏联部长会议艺术委员会曾在苏联首都莫斯科著名的国立特列甲科夫艺术陈列馆主办了“中国艺术展览会”。展览期中，艺术陈列馆的展览厅中经常是拥挤的，早晨还没有开门，门外就等着很长的行列。国立莫斯科东方文化博物馆举办着常年开放的中国美术展览会。苏联许多城市和乡村正在有系统地举行关于人民中国的展览会，参观的人非常踊跃。在苏联专家的帮助下，我国创办了专以学习苏联建设经验为宗旨的中国人民大学和哈尔滨工业大学。为了更直接地学习苏联建设的经验，我国于去年八月派遣首批留学生到苏联留学。在国内各地，学习俄文已形成热潮。北京清华大学中白发苍苍的老教授也和青年学生们在一起埋头学习，以便掌握这个学习社会主义文化的工具。
    在今年十一月七日起至十二月六日我国所举行的
    “中苏友好月”中，中苏两国的文化交流与文化合作更得到了空前未有的加强和发展。伟大的苏联人民派出了三百人的文化使团——苏联文化工作者代表团、苏联艺术工作团、苏军红旗歌舞团、苏联电影艺术工作者代表团来我国参加“中苏友好月”活动。他们已先后分别访问了北京、天津、上海、南京、杭州、武汉、长沙、广州、重庆、成都、西安、兰州、沈阳、长春等各大城市，向我国广大的人民群众和文化、艺术、科学工作者介绍了苏联在历史、农业、生物等科学工作上和文学、电影、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈等艺术工作上以及社会主义和共产主义建设等各方面的先进经验和伟大成就。截至十二月三日止，根据不完全的统计：这次来我国的苏联文化、科学、艺术工作者在参加我国各地的“中苏友好月”活动中已作了三十七次的专题报告，参加了六十九次的座谈会，我国的文化、科学、艺术工作者参加报告会和座谈会的共有十几万人。同时，苏联的著名艺术家还在我国各地正式演出五十多次，观众约二十九万多人，另外有组织的从广播中收听他们演唱的群众有一千六百万人。他们的这些报告、发言和演出对我国的文化、艺术工作都有很大的帮助。他们的访问，使我国广大人民更明确地认识了学习苏联的重要意义。与我国举行“中苏友好月”同时，苏联的首都莫斯科以及列宁格勒和苏联各加盟共和国的城乡中，举办了有关新中国的展览会、讲演会，并演出了我国的和有关我国的艺术节目，放映了我国的影片，使千百万苏联人民了解了中国人民的文化成就。
    在三年来的中苏两国文化交流的巨大工作中，苏联对外文化协会起了卓越的组织作用。
