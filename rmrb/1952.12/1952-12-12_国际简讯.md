	International Briefs

	Wall Street Billionaires and Truman
	According to a report from the British Reuters news agency, which obtained information from "authoritative sources" in the White House, several American big company bosses have earnestly expressed that they want to arrange a job for President Truman after he steps down on January 20 next year. It is said that one of them has already decided to give Truman a position with an annual salary of one million dollars. His presidential salary is only one hundred thousand dollars.

	It is no accident that Wall Street billionaires are so concerned about this retiring president. A calculation will make it clear: in 1951, the profits of American monopoly capitalists were 42.9 billion US dollars, thirteen times that of 1938. It was none other than Truman's policies that fattened them. The generosity of Wall Street billionaires towards Truman is therefore entirely understandable.

	Crimes by US Troops in Japan Continue to Increase
	Atrocities committed by the US occupation forces in Japan are endless.

	According to an announcement by the Japanese National Rural Police Headquarters on the 3rd, since the San Francisco Peace Treaty took effect on April 28 this year, foreign troops stationed in Japan and their personnel committed a total of 1,008 crimes in Japan in the five months from May to September. Kyodo News admitted that this number is even higher than the same period last year. Among these many crimes, the US occupation forces committed the most, with a total of 815 cases, accounting for more than 80% of all crimes. In five months, these reckless US troops committed 4 murders, 14 rapes, 90 robberies, and hundreds of cases of theft, assault, and personal injury.

	These figures are obviously greatly reduced official figures, but even these are enough to illustrate what the so-called "independence" that the United States gave to Japan actually entails.

    国际简讯
    华尔街亿万富翁和杜鲁门
    据英国的路透社从美国白宫“权威方面”获得的消息说，很有几位美国大公司老板很诚恳地表示过，一旦杜鲁门总统在明年元月二十日卸任后，要给他安排一个职业。据说其中有一位已经决定给杜鲁门一个年薪一百万美元的职位。他的总统年薪才不过十万美元。
    华尔街的亿万富翁们对于这位即将退休的总统这样关心不是偶然的。计算一下便会明白的，一九五一年美国垄断资本家的利润是四百二十九亿美元，为一九三八年的十三倍。不是别的而是杜鲁门的政策养肥了他们。华尔街亿万富翁对于杜鲁门的慷慨大度，也就完全可以理解了。
    美国驻军在日本犯罪行为有增无已
    在日本的美国占领军的暴行是层出不穷的。
    据日本国家地方警察本部三日宣布，从旧金山和约在今年四月二十八日生效以后，在今年五月到九月的五个月中，驻日外国军队及其所属人员在日本所发生的犯罪行为共计一千零八件。共同社承认，这个数字比去年同期还要多。在这许多罪行中，美国占领军所犯的最多，共计八百十五件，占全部罪行的百分之八十以上。那些胡作非为的美国驻军，在五个月中犯了谋杀案四件、强奸案十四件、抢劫案九十件，以及上百件的偷窃、殴打和伤害人身的罪行。
    这些数字显然是官方大大缩小了的数字，但是就是这些也足够说明美国给日本的所谓“独立”是些什么内容了。
