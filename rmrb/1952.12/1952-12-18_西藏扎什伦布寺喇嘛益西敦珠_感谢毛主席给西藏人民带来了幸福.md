To the Editor:

Please forward to my dear brothers of all nationalities: I truly don't know what words to use to truthfully and thoroughly report to you the joyous feelings of us Tibetan people since liberation and our gratitude to the great leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao. I think: perhaps the vocabulary in no ethnic language is currently sufficient to express such feelings from the bottom of our hearts completely and sincerely!

Thinking back to before liberation, due to the instigation of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, a split and disunity occurred between the two Living Buddhas, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, who we Tibetan people equally believe in. The Panchen Lama left. Tibet also suffered from floods and droughts for years, and there was no harvest of highland barley. The people were truly suffering! Now, with Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army, the forces of imperialist aggression have been driven out of Tibet, and the Panchen Lama can return. The two Living Buddhas have met and are united well, and we can have good days!

I am a lama. One day, I saw with my own eyes a comrade from the People's Liberation Army picking up a stone engraved with scriptures that had rolled into a ditch and placing it on the Mani pile where we offer scripture stones. I was almost moved to tears! I never imagined that the People's Liberation Army would respect our religious beliefs so much! I thought to myself: Aren't the People's Liberation Army all reincarnated Living Buddhas from heaven! They are people from lower places, coming to our plateau, and they don't look aggrieved at all, but still work and produce so arduously. High-ranking officials and soldiers alike reclaim wasteland and carry soil and manure. Their hands are broken, but they still laugh cheerfully. This is something that has never happened since ancient times. I heard them say, "We are the sons and daughters of Chairman Mao and all the Chinese people, and coming to Tibet, we are also the sons and daughters of all the Tibetan people." I was even more moved beyond words. I thought of the imperialist aggression that our Tibetan people suffered in the past: our Tashilhunpo Monastery was also looted by imperialism. The bronze Buddha in Gyantse Monastery was slashed with a knife by the imperialist army, and there is still a knife mark on its stomach. Now, with this group of heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers who are not afraid of hardship standing together with us Tibetan people to defend our territory and consolidate our national defense, and with the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the imperialists will no longer dare to bully us!

I have read the history of Tibet and deeply know that the Tibetan people and our Han elder brothers all love peace. We Chinese people will not bully others, but if others act tyrannically and bully us Chinese people, they will also be defeated by us. I heard that American imperialism still wants to invade us from the Korean side and release poisonous insects to harm people. This is even worse than the people in the turbid world, and it is precisely the heretical ways mentioned in the scriptures.

The more I think of the pain of being invaded and oppressed by imperialism in the past, the more I can experience the warmth and glory gained after liberation by returning to the big family of the motherland. Needless to say, with the help of the people of the motherland, Tibet will be built into a beautiful, happy, and auspicious paradise!

Now the Tibetan people have stood up! They have been rescued! Who made us stand up? Who rescued us? It is the great Living Buddha, Chairman Mao!

I asked the scientists from Beijing who came to help build Tibet for a photo of Chairman Mao and three Chairman Mao badges. I hung the photo of Chairman Mao in the scripture hall and recite the Longevity Sutra three times a day to wish him good fortune and longevity! I hung all three badges on my cassock, and I feel the more I hang, the more glorious it is. Many lamas want to get a photo of Chairman Mao, but we can't print them in this place. I hope you will bring us more photos and badges of Chairman Mao when you come to Tibet. Finally, let us sing together:

Long live Chairman Mao!

Yixi Dunzhu, Lama of Tashilhunpo Monastery in Tibet

    西藏扎什伦布寺喇嘛益西敦珠
    感谢毛主席给西藏人民带来了幸福
    编辑同志请转
    亲爱的各民族兄弟们：我真不知道用怎样的辞句才能把我们西藏人民在解放以后的快乐心情和我们对伟大的各族人民领袖毛主席的感谢真实、透彻地报告给你们。我想：也许无论那一个民族语言中的辞藻，要想把这样的来自心眼底下的感情整个地、真切地表达出来，现在恐怕还都是不会够用的罢！
    想起解放前由于帝国主义和国民党反动派的挑拨离间，我们西藏人民所同样信仰的两位佛爷——达赖佛爷和班禅佛爷之间发生了分裂和不团结。班禅佛爷出走。西藏也连年闹水灾、旱灾，青稞无收成。人民真是痛苦极了！现在有了毛主席、共产党、解放军，把帝国主义侵略势力赶出西藏，班禅佛爷才能回来。两位佛爷见了面，团结得好，我们也有好日子过了！
    我是一个喇嘛。有一天我亲眼看见一位解放军同志把滚到沟里的一块刻有经文的石头拣起来，放到我们供养经文石头的麻尼堆上。我几乎感动得要流泪了！我真想不到解放军会这样尊重我们的宗教信仰！我心里想：解放军莫不是都是天上佛爷转生的！他们是低地方的人，来到我们高原上，一点委屈的样子都没有，还是那么样的艰苦劳动生产。挺大的官长和士兵一块开荒地，抬土背粪。手磨破了，还是嘻嘻地笑。这是从古以来都没有的事。我听见他们说：“我们是毛主席和全中国人民的子弟兵，到西藏来也是全西藏人民的子弟兵。”我心里更是说不出的感动。我想起我们西藏人民过去所受到的帝国主义的侵略：我们扎什伦布寺也曾被帝国主义抢掠过。江孜寺的铜佛，被帝国主义的军队砍上一刀，现在肚子上还留有刀痕。现在有了这一批不怕艰难的英勇的人民子弟兵和我们西藏人民站在一起，保卫国土，巩固国防，还有毛主席的英明领导；帝国主义再也不敢欺负我们了！
    我读过西藏的历史，深切地知道西藏人民和汉族老大哥都是爱好和平的。我们中国人是不会欺负别人的，可是别人横行霸道来欺负我们中国人，也要被我们打败的。听说美帝国主义还想自朝鲜方面向我们侵略，放什么毒虫来害人。这连五浊世界的人都不如，正是经书上说的邪门外道。
    我愈想起过去受帝国主义侵略压迫的痛苦，愈能体验出解放以后回到祖国大家庭中所得到的温暖和光荣。更用不着说，在祖国人民的帮助下，西藏将要建设成为一个美满、幸福、吉祥的乐园！
    现在西藏人民是站起来了！是得到解救了！是谁使我们站起来的？是谁解救我们的？是伟大的活菩萨毛主席！
    我向自北京来的帮助建设西藏的科学家们要了一张毛主席像片和三个毛主席像章。我把毛主席像片挂在经堂里，一天念三遍长寿经，祝他老人家多福多寿！我把三个像章都挂在袈裟上，我觉得挂得愈多愈光荣。好些喇嘛都想得一张毛主席像片，可是我们这个地方不能印。希望您们到西藏来的时候，多给我们带些毛主席像片和像章。最后，让我们一起赞诵：
    毛主席万岁！
    西藏扎什伦布寺喇嘛  益西敦珠
