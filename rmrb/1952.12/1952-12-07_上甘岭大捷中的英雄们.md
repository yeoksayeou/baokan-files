    Heroes of the Victory at Shangganling
    Zhang Peng

    The American aggressors' brazen cessation of the armistice talks was not without reason. They had new illusions about that already bankrupt "military pressure." In mid-October, the U.S. invading army command launched a "fierce" offensive on the central front of the Korean battlefield, "the largest attack since the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge," using three infantry divisions (one U.S. division, two puppet divisions) and one U.S. airborne regiment, more than a hundred cannons, more than a hundred aircraft, and more than a hundred tanks. They chose two positions near Shangganling in front of Mount Wu Sheng (Heights 597.9 and 537.7) as their targets and placed their bets on October 14.

    At 5:30 that morning, everything was still immersed in the morning mist. Suddenly, dense artillery fire from the south broke the morning silence. Black fighter groups dropped heavy bombs from the air. Enemy forces of seven battalions climbed up these two hills in four routes. But before they even reached the top, many of them spread their arms, dropped their guns, and fell onto the hillside. Artillery fire from the north and hand grenades thrown from the hilltops bloomed in the enemy ranks. The first attack was thus beaten back by our army. Then, there was more artillery fire and more charges. From 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., the enemy launched more than forty consecutive attacks, resulting in over a thousand enemy casualties on the hillside. Finally, our army voluntarily abandoned a few small hillocks, and the defending troops switched to tunnel warfare. So, the robbers boasted triumphantly, saying: "This is the second major attack by the Allied Forces in 1952 north of Kimhwa, east of Triangle Hill, at Red Hill Fort (i.e., Height 597.9), and has captured a part of the Communist position, and is now striving to attack Triangle Hill." But they rejoiced too early. Two hours later, our troops launched a counterattack, and the troops in the tunnels also came out to attack, driving the enemy back in a disarray. Our army recovered all the positions.

    The next day, the enemy sent up six battalions, repeatedly fighting for a day, losing more than 1,800 men. The third day, four more battalions were sent; the fourth day, another battalion was sent… Every day, the enemy sent up more, and fewer returned. The battle had lasted for nearly a month. The enemy had already lost more than 24,000 men here, but these two positions were still in our hands. Sometimes, the enemy occupied the surface while we held the tunnels; sometimes the enemy occupied the hilltop during the day, but was driven off by us at night. The enemy poured fierce artillery fire on these two hilltops day and night. On this area of no more than four square kilometers, 300,000 artillery shells had fallen in one day. Not a single blade of grass was left on the mountain, and even the stones were shattered. But despite this, the enemy still could not occupy it.

    The soldiers fought on that bare hilltop relying on ingenious and solid tunnel fortifications. Just as the Second Delegation of the People of the Motherland to Korea came to the front lines, they wanted to see for themselves how the heroic sons of the motherland were fighting. They raised their binoculars on the hilltop. At that time, the enemy was shelling our positions, and the Red Hill Fort was shrouded in dirty smoke. Gradually, the fog dissipated somewhat, and not a single figure could be seen on the mountain. The enemy attacked, and suddenly, as if emerging from the ground, our soldiers appeared on the hilltop, defeating the enemy. When the enemy's shells flew over, no one could be seen again. After a while, when the artillery stopped, figures jumped and lay down on the hilltop. Our soldiers flexibly jumped from shell crater to shell crater, avoiding the enemy's artillery fire, and drove the attacking enemy down the mountain.

    Our commanders always repeatedly educated the troops to fight cleverly and flexibly, to inflict casualties on the enemy, and to preserve themselves. They cherished the soldiers more than themselves. In one counterattack, Battalion Commander Hao Laihui of the 1st Battalion, in order to better understand the situation and reduce casualties, personally led the company to the front, repeatedly repelling several enemy counterattacks. Finally, when the situation was unfavorable, he led the troops back to the tunnel. After a day of fighting, everyone was very tired. Battalion Commander Hao Laihui arranged for the soldiers to rest in the tunnel like he was taking care of his own brothers, while he alone guarded the tunnel entrance with a machine gun, repelling numerous enemy incursions.

    Our soldiers are truly heroes! The battle was so fierce and cruel, but they were always brave, tenacious, steadfast, and optimistic. Everyone advanced in battle, and no one retreated. Many second-line companies requested to fight, and they all said that participating in the battle of Mount Wu Sheng was the most glorious. After the wounded were injured, they had to be persuaded and forced to withdraw from the battle. The wounded requested not to be sent too far to the rear, so that they could return to the front as soon as they recovered.

    Squad Leader Sun Zhanyuan of the 3rd Platoon of the 7th Company of a certain unit was a hero in the style of Yang Gensi. In the blocking battle on October 14, he led his entire platoon to fight for the position. Both of his legs were broken, but he continued to command. After capturing the position, while repelling the enemy's counterattack, he fought two machine guns alone. Finally, when the bullets ran out and the enemy charged again, he pulled the fuse of his only hand grenade and rolled into the enemy ranks, sacrificing himself and blowing up the enemy who charged up.

    Huang Jiguang, a communications soldier of the 2nd Battalion Headquarters, followed the troops in a counterattack on the 17th. During the charge, he encountered an enemy firing point blocking our advance. He said to the instructor:
    "I'll go! If I can't destroy it, I'll stop it from firing bullets!" At that time, the People's Delegation of the Motherland had arrived at the front lines. He said to the instructor, "Tell the People's Delegation of the Motherland to listen for news of my victory!" After saying that, he ran over with a hand grenade. The enemy's machine gun fired very fiercely. After being hit by several bullets, he still lunged at the enemy's firing point, using his body to block an enemy machine gun, and used hand grenades to destroy two other machine guns. In order to remove the obstacles on the path of advance, for victory, for the motherland, Huang Jiguang gloriously dedicated his young life.

    A telephone operator of the 1st Battalion completed the task of laying the line three times under enemy fire. During the last connection, a shell hit him. At the moment of sacrifice, he struggled to hold the wire ends tightly with his numb hands to connect the wires and keep the circuit open.

    On November 2, the 8th Company repelled the enemy's counterattack on Height 597.9. At that time, two enemy companies were about to climb onto the position on their left flank. Soldiers Zhu Youguang and Wang Wancheng of the 1st Squad saw it and rushed over with two blasting tubes connected in parallel. At this time, the enemy had already climbed to the top of the mountain ahead of them and planted the signal flag on the position. Seeing the emergency, the two of them rushed up to meet the enemy regardless of everything. Zhu Youguang shouted loudly, "Comrades, the opportunity to make merit has arrived!" Wang Wancheng also shouted, "Comrades, capture prisoners!" As if they were charging with many comrades. The two of them, holding the parallel blasting tubes, rushed into the enemy ranks. With a loud bang, the enemies fell one after another, blood and flesh flying everywhere. The remaining few were frightened out of their wits and rolled down the mountain. In order to defend the motherland, for the great cause of peace, they generously dedicated their precious young lives. The two of them defeated two enemy companies.

    The tenacious and unyielding, closely united spirit of the comrades who held the tunnels was even more moving. The 8th Company of a certain unit held the large tunnel on Height 597.9 for as long as half a month. Later, when there was no cooked food to eat, they could only eat some raw rice, but they still had full fighting spirit and never stopped fighting. The enemy used strafing, explosions, and flamethrowers to destroy the tunnel entrances, and used sand and gravel to block them, trying to suffocate the people inside. But all of these were defeated by the soldiers in the tunnel. In the tunnel, the soldiers used the intervals between battles to teach each other, the old comrades teaching the new comrades how to skillfully use blasting tubes and hand grenades, because these were the only weapons they had in the tunnel. At night, they also sent out small groups to carry out activities, pushing the battle outside the tunnel. They were united like one person. The wounded were given water first, and the wounded were given food first. The uninjured took care of the injured, and the lightly wounded took care of the seriously wounded. When fighting, the wounded crawled on the ground to load bullets for the soldiers and uncover the lids of hand grenades. With so many people and so little food, everyone gave their food to others. Once, a transportation soldier of the 7th Company, braving the artillery fire, brought grain and ammunition to the comrades in the tunnel, carrying an apple with him. He was parched from walking, but he was reluctant to eat it, wanting to leave it for the comrades guarding the tunnel. However, after entering the tunnel, he didn't know who to give the apple to. He first gave it to the company commander. After receiving the apple, the company commander thought of the walkie-talkie operator, who had been contacting and shouting all day, his voice hoarse, and he deserved the apple the most. The company commander handed the apple to the walkie-talkie operator. The walkie-talkie operator thought of the soldiers fighting hard. The soldiers thought of the gloriously wounded. The wounded thought of the company commander who was commanding the battle. In this way, the apple was passed around, and no one ate it. Finally, the company commander said, let's all eat it. He took a small bite and passed it to the soldier next to him, and each soldier took a bite and passed it on, and everyone ate the apple.

    The soldiers in the tunnel never forgot the motherland. The gifts of the people of the motherland were sent to the tunnel, and the soldiers were extremely moved. After receiving the consolation bags printed with red characters, they all became active, their eyes shining. A soldier suggested that everyone sing a song. Everyone was happy. What to sing? After discussion, everyone agreed to sing "Aunt Wang Wants Peace"! Everyone sang at the top of their lungs. After singing, they still felt it was not enough. A wounded soldier supported himself and sat up and said: "We are guarding in the tunnel, also for the motherland. Let's all sing 'Ode to the Motherland'." Everyone sang happily again. The deeds of the heroes are endless.

    There were also the transporters, medical staff, and cooks, who worked equally bravely. In the days and nights of the battle, they carried more than 70 pounds of things on their backs on the muddy mountain paths covered with fallen leaves, climbing mountains and ridges, passing through the artillery blockade line where shrapnel was flying, and delivered food and ammunition to the front positions several times a night. They carried grain and ammunition when they went, and carried the wounded back. They washed blood-soaked clothes for the wounded in cold water, and worked tirelessly all night to do rescue work. They delivered food, vegetables, and boiled water to the positions and into the tunnels in wind and rain. When a cart company was transporting ammunition to the front and encountered an enemy counterattack, they cooperated with the infantry in combat, capturing ten light machine guns, twenty carbines, and one recoilless gun. A stretcher bearer from the 8th Company, named Tang Hongming, carried nine wounded soldiers from the position on November 2 in one day, and carried the stretcher nine times, from the company to the battalion aid station. In the middle, he had to pass through a three-mile-long artillery blockade line, six miles round trip, nine times reaching more than fifty miles. In addition, he sent sixteen boxes of ammunition, two times of steamed buns, and one time of boiled water. Finally, while transferring the wounded, shrapnel injured his back, but he did not say a word, gritted his teeth, and carried the wounded all the way to the aid station.

    The cooking squad of the 8th Company was also excellent. This squad also participated in the battle, eliminating more than 170 enemies. They had long stipulated three tasks for themselves: First, make good dishes and cook good meals in peacetime; Second, transport grain and ammunition and send the wounded in wartime; Third, act as the company's reserve team in combat. They finally realized their wishes, and the entire squad made meritorious service.

    It was these people, these heroes, who shattered the enemy's frantic attacks and defeated the enemy's three divisions.

    The so-called "air superiority" that the enemy relied on had neither frightened people in the past, and is even more nonsense now. Forty miles away from the front, one can see the transport lines in the daytime, constantly on the way, and the enemy planes can do nothing. We have powerful anti-aircraft artillery fire. In the forward command post, a comrade told me: In the first few days when the enemy launched the attack, the enemy planes were quite rampant; but soon, its arrogance converged - to be precise, it was defeated. In thirty-three days, we shot down and damaged 208 enemy planes. Now, the enemy's artillery spotter planes have also disappeared from our position, and fighter planes dare not come too often.

    Now, the battle is still continuing (the sound of artillery is still rumbling from the front positions from time to time). An Associated Press reporter said: "In the battle for the ridges of Kimhwa, the Allied forces have entered a decisive stage. They must decide: either stop this battle due to excessive loss of manpower and materials, or increase their forces to conduct a large-scale battle to achieve a complete victory." One thing he said in this passage is correct, that is, "the battle for the ridges of Kimhwa" has indeed entered a "decisive stage" - the stage of the American aggressors' failure.

    上甘岭大捷中的英雄们
    张鹏
    美国侵略者悍然中止停战谈判不是没有原因的。它对那个早已破产了的什么“军事压力”又产生了新的幻想。十月中旬，侵朝美军司令部在朝鲜战场的中线发起一个“来势汹汹”的、“自进攻伤心岭以来最大一次的攻击”，使用了三个步兵师（一个美军师、两个伪军师）和一个美军空降团，百门以上的大炮，百架以上的飞机，百辆以上的坦克。他们选定五圣山前沿上甘岭附近的两个阵地（五九七·九高地和五三七·七高地）作为进攻目标，在十月十四日把赌注押上了。
    那天早晨五点三十分，一切还沉浸在晓雾中。突然，从南方飞来的密集炮火打破了清晨的宁静。黑色的战斗机群从空中投下重磅炸弹。敌军七个营的兵力，分四路爬上这两个山坡。但他们还没有爬到山顶，就有不少人张开两臂，丢下枪，向山坡上倒下去了。从北方来的我军炮火和从山头上掷下的手榴弹，在敌军人群中开着花。第一次的进攻就这样被我军打了下去。接着，又是炮火和冲锋。从上午五点三十分直到下午五点三十分，敌人一连进攻了四十多次，结果一千多敌人死伤在山坡上。最后，我军主动放弃了几个小山包，守卫部队转入坑道作战。于是，强盗们就洋洋得意地吹嘘着说：“这是联军一九五二年向金化以北三角山以东红山堡（按即五九七·九高地）第二次大的攻击，并攻占了共军阵地一部，现正努力向三角山进攻。”但是他们欢喜得过早了。两个钟头以后，我们的部队发动了反击，坑道中的部队也攻出来，敌人被打得连滚带爬逃了回去，我军全部收复了阵地。
    第二天，敌人上来六个营，反复争夺了一天，损失了一千八百多人。第三天，送来了四个营；第四天，又送来了一个营；……每天每天，敌人都是上来的多，回去的少。战斗将近一个月了。敌人在这儿已经送掉了两万四千多人，但这两个阵地还在我们的手里。有时，敌人占了表面，我占住坑道；有时白天敌人占了山头，夜晚就被我赶了下去。敌人用炽热的炮火，不分昼夜地向这两个山头倾泻。在这方圆不过四平方公里的地面上，一天中曾落过三十万发炮弹。山上寸草不留，石头都炸得粉碎。但尽管这样，敌人还是不能把它占据。
    战士们就在那光秃秃的山头上依据巧妙坚固的坑道工事作战。正好祖国人民第二届赴朝慰问团来到了前线，他们要亲自看看祖国的英雄子弟怎样作战。他们在山头上举起了望远镜。那时敌人正炮击着我们的阵地，那个红山堡笼罩在污灰的烟雾中。渐渐地雾散了一些，山上连一个人影都看不见。敌人攻上来了，突然，好像从地底下冒出来的一样，山头上出现了我们的战士，他们把敌人打败了下去。等到敌人的炮弹飞来时，一下子又看不见一个人了。一会，炮一停，人影就在山头上跳起、卧下。我们的战士们灵活地在炮弹坑中跳来跳去，躲开敌人的炮火，把进攻的敌人打下山去。
    我们的指挥员总是反复地教育部队要机智灵活地作战，杀伤敌人，保存自己。他们爱惜战士甚于自己。在一次反击中，一营营长郝来会，为了更好地掌握情况，减少部队的伤亡，亲自带领连队上阵地，连续击退敌人几次的反扑。最后，情况不利时，他带着部队退守到坑道里。作战一天了，大家都很疲劳。郝来会营长就像照顾自己的兄弟一样安排战士们在坑道里休息，自己独个儿抱着一挺机枪，守卫在坑道口，打退敌人多次的侵扰。
    我们的战士真是英雄好汉！战斗这样激烈、残酷，但他们始终是英勇、顽强、坚贞、乐观。战斗中人人向前，没有一个后退。许多二线连队都要求战斗，他们一致说，参加五圣山作战最光荣。伤员负伤后，要说服、强迫才退出战斗。伤员们请求不要把他们往后方送得太远了，以便痊愈后，能早日再上前线。
    某部七连三排排长孙占元，是杨根思式的英雄。在十月十四日的阻击战中，他带领全排争夺阵地，两条腿都打断了，仍继续指挥；夺取了阵地后，在打退敌人的反扑时，他一个人打两挺机枪，最后子弹打完，敌人又冲上来，他就拉开仅有的一颗手榴弹的导火线，滚进敌人群中，牺牲了自己，炸死了冲上来的敌人。
    二营营部通讯员黄继光，在十七号那天，跟随部队一起反击，在冲锋的途中，他遇到了敌人的一个火力点封锁着我前进的道路。他就对指导员说：
    “我去！炸不毁它，也叫它打不出子弹来！”那时祖国人民慰问团到了前线，他对指导员说：“告诉祖国人民慰问团，听我胜利的消息吧！”说完，他就拿着手雷跑了过去，敌人的机枪射得非常猛烈，他在身中几颗子弹后，仍然猛扑到敌人的火力点前，用身体堵住了一挺敌人的机枪，并且用手雷消灭了另外两挺机枪，为了扫除前进道路上的障碍，为了胜利，为了祖国，黄继光光荣地献出了他年轻的生命。
    一营有一位电话员，他在敌人的炮火下，三次完成了架线任务，最后一次接线时，炮弹打中了他。在临牺牲时，他还挣扎着用已经麻木了的两手紧紧地捏着线头把电线接起来，保持电路的畅通。
    十一月二号，八连在五九七·九阵地上，打退了敌人的反扑。当时敌人有两个连，正要爬上他们左侧的阵地。一班战士朱有光、王万成看见了，就抱着两个并联在一起的爆破筒飞奔过去。这时敌人已先他们一步爬上了山头，并把信号旗插在阵地上了。他俩一看，情况紧急，便不顾一切，迎着敌人，冲了上去。朱有光高声地喊着：“同志们，立功的机会到了！”王万成也喊着：“同志们，捉俘虏呀！”就像他们是同许多同志在一起冲锋一样。他们两人抱着并联的爆破筒，扑入敌群，轰隆一声，敌人纷纷倒地，血肉横飞；余下的几个人吓破了胆，咕咕碌碌滚下山去了。为了保卫祖国，为了伟大的和平事业，他们慷慨献出了宝贵的青春的生命。他们两个人击溃了敌人两个连。
    坚守坑道的同志们的顽强不屈、亲密团结的精神更是动人。某部八连坚守在五九七·九阵地上的大坑道里达半个月之久。后来没熟粮吃时，就只能吃点生大米，但他们仍有着饱满的战斗情绪，战斗不息。敌人用扫射、用爆炸、用火焰喷射器来破坏坑道口，用砂土碎石来填堵，想把里面的人窒息。但所有这些都被坑道里的战士们击败了。在坑道里，战士们利用战斗空隙，展开互教互学，老同志教新同志熟练地使用爆破筒和手雷的技术，因为这两样东西是他们坑道里仅有的武器。夜里，他们还派小组出去活动，把战斗推到坑道外边。他们团结得像一个人。有水先让伤员喝，有粮先给伤员吃。没有负伤的伺候负伤的，轻伤的照顾重伤的。打仗的时候，伤员们就爬在地上给战士们压子弹，揭手榴弹的盖子。人多食物少，每个人都把可吃的东西让给别人吃。一次，七连的一个运输员，冒着炮火，给坑道内的同志送粮弹时，身上带着一个苹果，他自己走得口干舌燥，但舍不得吃，他要留给坚守坑道的同志们吃。可是，进入坑道后，他不知道该把这个苹果送给谁吃才好。他首先送给了连长，连长接到了苹果后，想到了步行机员，他一天到晚联络喊话，嗓子都嘶哑了，他最应该吃这个苹果。连长就把苹果递给步行机员。步行机员想到了艰苦作战的战士。战士想到了光荣负伤的伤员。伤员又想到了指挥作战的连长。这样，苹果传了一遍，谁也没有吃它。最后，连长说，大家都来吃吧。他轻轻地咬了一小口，便递给身边的战士，每个战士接了吃一口又传下去，每个人都吃到了这只苹果。
    战士们在坑道里念念不忘地想着祖国。祖国人民的慰问品送到坑道里，战士们感动极了。他们接到了印着红字的慰问袋后，都活跃起来了，眼睛里闪着光彩。一位战士提议大家唱一个歌吧。大家都高兴起来了。唱个什么呢？讨论结果，大家同意唱“王大妈要和平”！大家就放大嗓子唱了。唱完了，还觉得不够。一个伤员支撑着身子坐起来说：“我们守在坑道内，也是为了祖国。咱们大家唱个‘歌唱祖国’吧。”大家就又愉快地唱了起来。英雄们的事迹是说不完的。
    还有那些运输员、医务员和炊事员，他们同样英勇地工作着。在战斗的日日夜夜里，他们在铺满落叶的泥泞的山间小路上，背着七十斤以上的东西，翻山越岭，穿过弹片飞溅的炮火封锁线，一夜数次地把粮食弹药送到前沿阵地上。他们去时背粮弹，回来抬伤员。他们在冷水里给伤员洗血衣，彻夜不眠地做救护工作。他们风里雨里，把饭、菜、开水送到阵地上去，送到坑道里去。有一个小车连在运送弹药到前沿时，遇上敌人反扑，他们就配合着步兵作战，缴获轻机枪十挺、卡宾枪二十支和无座力炮一门。八连的一个担架员，叫唐洪明，在十一月二日的一天中，从阵地上背下了九个伤员，又抬了九次担架，从连到营救护所，中间要通过三里长的炮火封锁线，来回六里，九次即达五十余里。此外，他还送了十六箱弹药，送过两次馒头，一次开水。最后在转送伤员的途中，弹片炸伤了他的背，可是他一声不响，咬着牙，还一直把伤员抬到救护所里。
    八连的炊事班也是好样的。这个班也参加了战斗，消灭了一百七十多名敌人。他们早就给自己规定了三个任务：一、平时做好菜，作好饭；二、战时运粮弹，送伤员；三、战斗中作连的预备队。他们终于实现了他们的愿望，全班都立了战功。
    就是这些人，就是这些英雄们，他们粉碎了敌人的疯狂进攻，把敌人的三个师都打垮了。
    敌人倚仗的所谓“空中优势”，过去既没有吓倒人，现在是更加扯淡了。在离前沿四十来里的地方，白天也可看到运输的行列，络绎于途，敌人的飞机也奈何不得。我们有了强大的对空射击炮火。在前方指挥所里，一个同志告诉我：在敌人刚发起进攻的头几天，敌人的飞机还是相当猖狂的；但不久，它的气焰就收敛了——确切地说，是被打垮了。三十三天中，我们就打落打伤了敌机二百零八架。现在，敌人的炮兵校正机也在我们这个阵地上绝迹了，战斗机也不敢多来了。
    现在，战斗还在持续着（前沿阵地上还不时传来隆隆的炮声）。美联社的记者说：“在争夺金化诸岭的战斗中，联军已进入决定性阶段。他们必须决定：要嘛由于人力物力的损失太大而停止这个战斗，要嘛就增加兵力进行一次大规模战斗，以获得
    一次彻底的胜利。”他这段话里，有一点说对了，就是“争夺金化诸岭的战斗”确已进入“决定性阶段”——美国侵略者失败的阶段。
