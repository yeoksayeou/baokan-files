    Several Questions Regarding People's Bursaries (I)
    Editor's note: Recently, we have received letters from students all over the country inquiring about specific issues such as the standards, eligibility conditions, assessment principles, and usage of People's Bursaries for students at all levels and types of schools. We will answer the more common questions in installments as follows:
    Question: Why are People's Bursaries being adjusted for students in schools of all levels and types across the country? Will the amount received by students be higher than before after the adjustment?
    Answer: Our country is facing large-scale economic construction. Planned development of education and timely supply of senior and intermediate cadres, as well as scientific and technical personnel necessary for various construction undertakings, is one of the keys to ensuring the realization of various construction tasks. In order to reduce the difficulties for young people, especially worker and peasant youth, to enter schools, improve student health, and enable them to better complete their studies so as to better serve the people, appropriate adjustment of student People's Bursaries is very necessary. Therefore, on July 23rd of this year, the Central Ministry of Education issued the "Notice on Adjusting the Standards of Salaries for Teaching and Administrative Staff and People's Bursaries for Students in Schools of All Levels and Types Across the Country" in accordance with the spirit and principles of the Government Administration Council's "Notice on Adjusting People's Bursaries for Students in National Institutions of Higher Education and Secondary Schools." After the adjustment of student People's Bursaries, the standards for student People's Bursaries in schools of all levels and types across the country and the proportion of students receiving People's Bursaries are generally higher than before the adjustment, except for junior high schools.
    Question: What are the principles for assessing People's Bursaries?
    Answer: People's Bursaries are mainly intended to appropriately solve the food and other material difficulties necessary for students with financial difficulties to complete their studies. In institutions of higher education and secondary specialized schools, in addition to providing food expenses to every student equally (the food standard should not affect students' health as a principle), the remaining portion is managed uniformly by the school, using a method of student application, democratic discussion, submission to the bursary review committee for review, and final approval by the principal. It is distributed in several grades according to the specific circumstances of the applicant students to solve their needs for study supplies or to supplement clothing. Because each student's specific financial situation is different, it cannot be equally divided among every student. In ordinary middle schools, the distribution of student People's Bursaries is limited to students with financial difficulties and must also go through application, evaluation, and approval procedures. When evaluating People's Bursaries, schools of all levels and types should give priority to addressing the actual difficulties of family members of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, worker-peasant cadres, industrial workers, ethnic minority students, and returned overseas Chinese children, while also reasonably solving the financial difficulties of other students. Students from landlord families can also receive People's Bursaries if they have financial difficulties. When evaluating student People's Bursaries, a thorough understanding of the students' financial situation should be obtained, and supporting documents (proving their family circumstances) should be obtained from the military units, government offices, trade unions, farmers' associations, and government departments to serve as a basis for assessment. Learning performance, ideological status, and political quality can also be used as reference, but are not the sole determining factors.
    Question: Why are food expenses universally and equally distributed in institutions of higher education, secondary technical schools, and normal schools, but not in ordinary middle schools at present?
    Answer: Students in institutions of higher education, secondary technical schools, and normal schools are uniformly assigned by the state to directly participate in the country's various construction projects after graduation. In order to encourage outstanding youth, especially to attract a large number of worker and peasant youth and children of workers and peasants, to apply for the above three types of schools, and to actively improve student health and solve student living difficulties so as to enable them to study with greater peace of mind and better complete their studies, a 100% bursary system is implemented, with all food expenses provided by the state, and appropriate subsidies for study supplies and other daily necessities for students with financial difficulties. Doing so is entirely to meet the needs of national construction, and is therefore reasonable and correct.
    Ordinary middle schools have a large number of students. Generally, more young people are willing to apply for ordinary middle schools to directly enter institutions of higher education, rather than applying for secondary technical schools, especially normal schools. If the same treatment is stipulated, fewer people will apply for secondary technical schools and normal schools, which cannot meet the state's need for intermediate technical cadres and elementary school teachers. Therefore, the bursary regulations for ordinary middle school students are relatively low. However, according to the actual situation, high schools implement a 30% bursary of 95,000 yuan per person per month, and junior high schools implement a 20% bursary of 85,000 yuan per person per month (which can be adjusted according to the financial situation of the students in each school), which can generally solve the special difficulties of students.

    关于人民助学金的几个问题（一）
    编者按：最近我们收到全国各地学生来信，询问关于各级各类学校学生人民助学金的标准、享受的条件、评定的原则以及人民助学金如何使用等具体问题，现将带有普遍性的问题分期答复如下：
    问：为什么调整全国各级各类学校学生人民助学金？调整后学生所得数额是否均较以前为高？
    答：我们的国家面临着大规模的经济建设，有计划的发展教育事业，及时地供应各项建设事业中所必需的高级、中级干部和科学技术人才，是保证实现各项建设任务的关键之一。为了减少青年、特别是工农青年入学的困难，增进学生健康，使他们更好的完成学习任务，以便更好的为人民服务，适当的调整学生人民助学金是十分必要的。因此中央教育部于今年七月二十三日根据政务院“关于调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金的通知”的精神和原则规定颁发了“关于调整全国各级各类学校教职员工工资及学生人民助学金标准的通知”。学生人民助学金调整后，全国各级各类学校学生人民助学金的标准和享受人民助学金的学生人数的比例，除初级中学外一般说均较调整前提高了。
    问：评定人民助学金的原则是什么？
    答：人民助学金主要是为了适当解决经济困难的学生的伙食及其他为了完成学习任务所必需的物质困难。在高等学校、中等专业学校除同等地普遍地发给每一个学生伙食费外（伙食标准以不影响学生健康为原则），其余部分，由学校统一掌握，采用由学生申请，民主讨论，提请助学金审议委员会审议，最后由校长核定的方式评定。按申请学生的具体情况，分若干等发给，以解决其学习用品或补充衣被之用。由于每个同学的具体经济情况不同，因此不能同等地平均分给每个同学。在普通中学，学生人民助学金的发给限于经济困难的学生，也须经过申请评议、核准的手续。各级各类学校在评议人民助学金时，应尽先照顾革命烈属、革命军人、工农干部、产业工人、少数民族学生及归国华侨子女的实际困难，同时也必须合理地解决其他学生的经济困难。对地主家庭出身的学生，如经济困难，也可以领得人民助学金。在评议学生人民助学金时，应深入了解学生的经济情况，分别取得部队、机关、工会、农会以及政府部门的证明文件（证明其家庭情况），以作评定时的根据。至于学习成绩、思想情况、政治质量等亦可作为参考，但并不是惟一的决定条件。
    问：为什么高等学校、中等技术学校、师范学校普遍地、同等地发给伙食费，而普通中学目前则不是这样？
    答：高等学校、中等技术学校和师范学校的学生毕业后即由国家统一分配直接参加祖国各项建设工作，为鼓励优秀青年、特别是吸收广大工农青年、工农子女，投考以上三种学校，并积极改进学生健康，解决学生生活困难，以便使他们更安心学习，更好的完成学习任务，所以实行百分之百的助学金制，全部由国家供给伙食费，并适当补助经济困难学生的学习用品以及其他生活必需用费。这样做，是完全为了适应国家建设的需要，因而也是合理的，正确的。
    普通中学学生人数多，一般青年多愿投考普通中学直接升入高等学校，而不愿投考中等技术学校，特别是师范学校，如规定同样的待遇，则投考中等技术学校和师范学校的将更少，这就不能满足国家建设对中级技术干部和小学教师的需要。因此普通中学学生助学金规定的比较低。但根据实际情况普通中学高中实行百分之三十的每人每月九万五千元，初中实行百分之二十的每人每月八万五千元的助学金（按各校学生经济情况可以调剂），一般是可以解决学生的特殊困难的。
