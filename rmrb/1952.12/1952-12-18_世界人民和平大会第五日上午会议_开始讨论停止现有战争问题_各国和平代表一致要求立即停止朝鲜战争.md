Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17th: TASS Vienna, December 17th dispatch: The World People's Peace Conference morning session on December 16th began discussing the second item on the agenda - stopping existing wars. The meeting was chaired by Spanish representative Jose Giral.

Guo Moruo, winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize and Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation, made a long speech on stopping existing wars (the full text of the speech will be published separately - editor). When this outstanding scientist and writer of the People's Republic of China, a famous peace fighter, appeared on the podium, the representatives and guests welcomed him with prolonged applause.

The next to speak was Dr. Kitchlew, head of the Indian delegation and chairman of the All-India Peace Council. He was greeted with a storm of applause. He spoke about the Korean issue.

He said that he was deeply impressed by a sentence from the Soviet writer Ehrenburg. Ehrenburg said that the Soviet people were unwilling to treat those who committed acts of aggression and the victims of aggression "in the same way." This principle is the guiding light of the Indian national movement.

Kitchlew pointed out that there were different opinions in India and among Indian representatives regarding the cause of the Korean War, but all people in India unanimously recognized the following points: First, the use of napalm bombs and saturation bombing is detrimental to human dignity and should be stopped immediately; Second, the bombing of the Yalu River by the US Air Force was a blow to peace and an act of war; Third, any support for the South Korean Syngman Rhee regime is support for something that the United Nations should oppose; Fourth, the massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and the mistreatment of prisoners of war grossly violate international law; Fifth, allegations about the use of bacteriological weapons by the US military in China and Korea have caused widespread anxiety in India. Nehru once said that India should loudly oppose the use of bacteriological weapons in any country.

Kitchlew said, I would like to make a few suggestions on this basis and ask the conference to adopt them.

First, it must be demanded that the Korean War be stopped immediately.

Second, we suggest that the difficult-to-resolve issue of prisoners of war should not become a contentious issue. All prisoners of war should be repatriated in accordance with international law. Naturally, there are various differences in the interpretation of international law, but with peace and a ceasefire, it will be easier to resolve these differences.

Third, we believe that in order to resolve all other issues and to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire, a committee composed of representatives of the relevant countries should be established. We believe that it would be a mistake if this committee did not include the truly relevant parties, and it would be a complete failure if any major power, including the People's Republic of China, or North Korea or South Korea, were not on this committee.

Fourth, the Indian delegation attending this conference suggests that any solution to the current Korean War must be based on the following principles: The Korean people must have the right to decide their future destiny and must be free. We propose that the conference call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, including the United Nations forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers, from Korea.

Kitchlew said that, needless to say, in order to achieve consensus - but our principles must be adhered to - we are very willing to revise any of our suggestions. I should like to reassure our Korean and Chinese friends that the Indian people will never be deceived by those who seek to incite Asians to kill each other.

Dr. Kitchlew returned to the presidium amidst the applause of the delegates.

The next speaker was Korean representative Han Xueye. He said, I am speaking on behalf of the suffering Korean people who are fighting for their freedom and independence to all the representatives. I know that the people of all countries need peace, but it may even be asserted that there is no country in the world whose people need peace today as urgently as our people.

My emotions cannot be calm when I talk about what is happening in our country, our country needs peace so much, peace, and more peace!

I cannot speak calmly when the war is raging in our country.

Friends, representatives! If you are standing on the podium speaking, just think for a moment that at this very moment, in your hometown where your wives, children, brothers, sisters, friends, and neighbors live, in the land where your people live, at this very minute, a large number of bombs are being dropped, containers filled with plague-infested fleas are being opened, and burning napalm bombs are raining down on the heads of children, then you will easily understand my excitement.

Han Xueye said, friends, representatives! On behalf of the bleeding people of Korea, on behalf of men, women, old people, and children, I ask you, the representatives of the people of all countries in the world, including the representatives of the American people, to do everything possible to unite the people of all countries and work together to immediately stop the cruel and bloody war being waged in Korea under the banner of the United Nations.

Our people, who have made unprecedented sacrifices, have shown the world their courage and their will to fight for peace. We do not beg, nor do we intend to beg for anyone's pity. But we ask for peace for the sake of humanitarian principles, to protect women and children, to stop the barbaric atrocities that destroy peaceful residents, for the sake of our country, and also for the sake of all humanity, which is currently threatened by the flames of the cruel war burning in our country.

All those who do not want the flames of another war to burn in their own country, rise up and do your best to put out the flames of the Korean War. All those who sincerely hope to end the Korean War, who sincerely hope to prevent the outbreak of another world war, rise up and demand the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, a just and reliable treaty that instills hope for tranquility and lasting peace into the hearts of all mankind!

I will end with the words I started with. If you ask yourself: what does humanity need most now, the answer is: first, hope for the possibility of peace, second, confidence in the possibility of peace, and third, the will to fight for peace.

As for these demands, I would like to say at the conference that our people have this hope, this confidence, and this will.

After Han Xueye's speech, cheers resounded throughout the venue and lasted for a long time, symbolizing the unity of all the representatives and the heroic Korean people.

British representative, "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize winner Mrs. Monica Felton spoke next. She said: She is not only speaking here on behalf of the British delegation, but also on behalf of many British and American prisoners of war in Korea - these prisoners of war have realized how cruelly they were deceived when they were sent to fight in the war, supposedly they were sent to fight in order to uphold the principle of collective security, and in all the disputes over the issue of prisoners of war that have occurred in recent months, only one voice - in some respects the most decisive voice - has not been heard, and that is the voice of the prisoners of war themselves.

Mrs. Felton said: Three months ago, she visited Korea again, and she knew that many prisoners of war in the POW camps on the banks of the Yalu River were anxiously watching the progress of the conference, and they hoped that the people of the world would give them the opportunity to return home and reunite with their families. Mrs. Felton said: The prisoners of war had asked her to tell the people of the world that the broad masses of people everywhere must be made aware of the truth about the crimes committed against the Korean people in the past two and a half years. First is the fact of germ warfare. Mrs. Felton said: These crimes have not stopped. The scene of Korea she saw in 1952 was even more shocking than the already ruined Korea of 1951. Therefore, the prisoners of war asked her to explain the truth to people everywhere - the truth about the atrocities committed by the interventionist forces in Korea.

Mrs. Felton said: The prisoners of war also raised the question: when will they be free? Many of them said: The solution to the prisoner of war problem is naturally to fulfill the terms of the Geneva Convention and exchange all prisoners of war without exception. They asked good people to expose the scam of "voluntary repatriation" - this is what the prisoners of war themselves said.

Finally, Mrs. Felton put forward a proposal in which the British delegation unanimously urged the conference to demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea as a preliminary condition for negotiating other unresolved issues.

American representative George Hayward said that the representatives of the American delegation were deeply moved by the speeches of many representatives calling for the major powers to begin negotiations to resolve all issues. He said that the American delegation is convinced that it is possible to negotiate without any pressure and to prevent the course of history from heading towards war... Some people tell the American people that their national independence has been threatened, is it simply because another country has chosen a different way of life that the security and independence of the United States is threatened? Since some people say that the American way of life is superior, then why be afraid of peaceful competition between the two systems?

George Hayward also said that a country must also recognize the independent rights of other countries in order to defend its own independence.

The Korean War shows what consequences have arisen from acts of violating the national independence of the people. The vast majority of the American people condemn the Korean War.

George Hayward said that the American delegation believes that the Korean War must be stopped, and it must be done immediately.

The next speaker was a Canadian soldier, Yvon Ducharme, who was repatriated from Korea. In 1950, when he was only eighteen years old, he was drafted into the army because he was unemployed. Ducharme was sent to Korea and landed on the Korean front. Soon he was injured and sent to a hospital. Ducharme said that there he met British, Canadian, and Filipino soldiers. He began to think: why did he leave his country and come to Korea, thousands of kilometers away? What did all these wounded soldiers want to get in Korea?

So, Ducharme decided that he must tell the truth about the Korean War. After returning to Canada, he became an active fighter for peace. He said that it must be demanded that the Korean War be stopped immediately, that all wars must be stopped, and that young people must be allowed to go home.

Also speaking at the morning meeting were Giuseppe Casadei, representative of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, and John Platts-Mills, representative of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: According to TASS Vienna, December 16th: At the evening meeting of the World People's Peace Conference on the 15th, Italian Senator Emilio Sereni, Hungarian Catholic priest Janos Mette, Chairman of the Egyptian National Peace Committee Ibrahim Rashad, Moroccan representative Abdulla, Indian representative Adityan and French farmer representative Laforet spoke successively.

Sereni spoke about the rising tide of the Italian peace movement, pointing out that in Europe and the Americas, the Near East and the Middle East, more and more people are beginning to recognize that military bases, which some call tools to ensure national security, are in fact weapons of war and enslavement in the hands of foreign countries.

Sereni then spoke about the issue of the five major powers concluding a peace pact. He said: The idea of concluding a peace pact has been endorsed by 600 million people in countries all over the world. Everyone knows that only by concluding a peace pact among the five major powers can the national independence and security of large and small countries and world peace be reliably guaranteed. Sereni finally said: Only when China has obtained its rightful place in the United Nations, only when the United Nations pays attention to the voices of the people of all countries, and only when it listens to the demands of the people of all countries to hold negotiations among the five major powers and conclude a peace pact, can the United Nations resume its tasks.

Hungarian Catholic priest Janos Mette spoke on behalf of 3,340 clergymen in Hungary, saying that we Hungarian Catholic clergymen support the sacred cause of lasting world peace in our sermons. We believe that the Catholic world must raise its voice to condemn the terrible germ warfare and those who are responsible for it, and demand an immediate end to the Korean War. We believe that the use of atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons is the most serious crime. He presented the book of signatures signed by 3,340 Hungarian Catholics expressing their love of peace to the conference chairman Korneichuk as a gift to the World Peace Council.

Egyptian representative Rashad congratulated the conference on behalf of the Egyptian people. He then denounced the Western countries for trying to maintain their position in Egypt under the pretext of protecting Egypt. Rashad emphasized that Egypt is not threatened by aggression and does not want to fight for interests that have nothing to do with us. We hope that the people of all countries should take advantage of all opportunities to produce wealth and freely exchange wealth with each other so that everyone can benefit.

The next speaker was Moroccan representative Abdulla. He said that under the domination of imperialists, our country has been divided into a French zone, a Spanish zone, and a so-called international zone. The Americans have also built seven air bases on our territory. French imperialists are trampling on the culture and national dignity of the Moroccan people. The rule of the imperialists has completely destroyed our rich country. Famine is constantly descending on Morocco. Abdulla said that the Moroccan people are waging a tenacious struggle against the rule of foreign imperialism and for the freedom and independence of the country.

Abdulla said: Our people's specific demands on the French government are: no more police terror in Morocco; immediate recognition of democratic freedom; the establishment of new relations between France and Morocco in order to establish a Moroccan government, which will conclude a new agreement with France on an equal footing and abolish the status of protectorate.

The next speaker was Indian representative Adityan. He pointed out that the governments of France and Portugal occupy territories along the coast of India, which constantly makes the Indian people feel uneasy.

The last speaker was French representative Laforet, who paid tribute to the conference on behalf of French farmers. He then described the difficult situation of French farmers under the war economy. He concluded by saying that the French National Peasants' Peace Conference held in Paris in November suggested that the conference try to end the wars in Vietnam and Korea as soon as possible, oppose the ratification of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, oppose militarization and the movement to expand armaments, and strive to restore economic and cultural exchanges between countries.

    世界人民和平大会第五日上午会议
    开始讨论停止现有战争问题
    各国和平代表一致要求立即停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社维也纳十七日讯：世界人民和平大会十二月十六日上午会议开始讨论议程上的第二个问题——停止现有战争。会议由西班牙代表何塞·希拉尔担任主席。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、中国代表团副团长郭沫若作了关于停止现有战争的长篇发言（发言全文另发——编者）。当这位中华人民共和国的杰出的科学家和作家、著名的和平战士在讲台上出现时，代表们和来宾们以经久不息的掌声表示欢迎。
    接着发言的是印度代表团团长、全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士。他受到暴风雨般的掌声的欢迎。他谈的是朝鲜问题。
    他说，苏联作家爱伦堡的一句话使他获得了深刻的印象。爱伦堡说，苏联人民不愿意把那些犯了侵略罪行的人们和侵略的牺牲者“一视同仁”。这个原则正是印度民族运动的指南针。
    克其鲁指出，关于朝鲜战争的起因问题，在印度以及在印度代表间有着不同的意见，但是，印度所有的人都一致承认下列几点：一、使用凝固汽油弹和饱和轰炸是有损人类体面的事，应该立即停止；二、美国空军轰炸鸭绿江是对和平的一个打击，是一个战争行动；三、对南朝鲜李承晚政权的任何支持就是支持联合国照理说应该反对的东西；四、屠杀朝中战俘和虐待战俘的行动粗暴地违反了国际法；五、关于美军在中国和朝鲜使用的细菌武器的指责已在印度引起了普遍的不安。尼赫鲁曾说过，印度应该大声疾呼地反对在任何国家使用细菌武器。
    克其鲁说，我愿意在这个基础上提出几个建议，请大会通过。
    第一、必须要求立即停止朝鲜战争。
    第二、我们建议不要使难以分解的战俘问题成为一个争论不休的问题。全部战俘都应该按照国际法予以遣返。自然，在国际法的解释上有种种分歧，但是，有了和平，停了火，就比较容易解决这些分歧了。
    第三、我们认为，为了解决一切其他问题，为了监督停火的实施，应该成立一个由各有关国家的代表组成的委员会。我们认为，如果这个委员会不包括真正有关的方面，那就是一个错误，如果任何一个大国，包括中华人民共和国在内，或者是北朝鲜或南朝鲜，不在这个委员会之内，那就是彻底的失败。
    第四、出席这次大会的印度代表团建议：解决目前的朝鲜战争的任何办法都必须根据下列原则：朝鲜人民必须有权决定他们未来的命运，必须获得自由。我们建议大会要求一切外国军队、包括联合国军和中国人民志愿军在内，自朝鲜撤退。
    克其鲁说，不用说，为了取得一致——但是我们的原则是要坚持的——我们非常愿意修正我们的建议的任何一条。我应该请我们的朝鲜和中国朋友放心，印度人民决不会受那些企图促使亚洲人自相残杀的人们的欺骗。
    克其鲁博士在代表们的掌声中回到主席团席位上。
    接着发言的是朝鲜代表韩雪野。他说，我代表正在为自己的自由和独立而奋斗的苦难深重的朝鲜人民向全体代表们讲话。我知道各国人民都需要和平，但是，可能甚至可以断定，世界上没有哪一个国家的人民今天需要和平有如我国人民这样迫切。
    我谈到正在我国发生的事情时，我的感情不能平静，我国是如此的需要和平，和平、还是和平！
    当战争正在我国猛烈进行的时候，我不能平静地讲话。
    朋友们，代表们！如果你们站在讲台上讲话的时候，只要稍微想一想，正在这个时候，在你们的妻子、儿女、兄弟、姊妹、朋友和邻人居住的家乡，在你们的人民所居住的国土，就在这一分钟，大批炸弹往下投，满装着传染鼠疫的跳蚤的容器正在张开，燃烧着的凝固汽油弹像雨点一般地落在儿童们的头上，你们就易于理解我的激动了。
    韩雪野说，朋友们，代表们！我代表流血的朝鲜的人民，代表男子、妇女、老年人和孩子，要求你们世界各国人民的代表们，包括美国人民的代表在内，尽一切可能团结各国人民一起努力，立即制止在联合国的旗帜下在朝鲜进行的残酷的流血战争。
    作了空前牺牲的我国人民，已向全世界显示了他们的勇气和争取和平的意志。我们并不乞求，也不打算乞求任何人的怜悯。但是我们要求和平是为了人道的原则，为了保卫妇女和儿童，为了制止毁灭和平居民的野蛮暴行，为了我们国家的利益，同时也为了目前正在我们国家中燃烧的残酷的战争火焰所威胁着的一切人类的利益。
    一切不希望另一次战争的烈火燃烧到他们本国去的人们起来尽力扑灭朝鲜战争的火焰罢。一切真诚希望结束朝鲜战争、真诚希望防止另一次世界大战爆发的人们起来要求缔结五大国和平公约，缔结一个把宁静和持久和平的希望灌注到全人类的心灵中的公正而可靠的条约罢！
    我还是用我一开头的话来做结束。如果你们问问你们自己：现在人类最需要的是什么，答复是：第一，对于和平可能性的希望，第二，对于和平可能性的信心，第三，争取和平的意志。
    至于这些要求，我愿意在大会上说，我们的人民有这种希望，有这种信心，而且有这种意志。
    韩雪野的发言结束后，欢呼声响彻会场，经久不息，它象征着全体代表和英雄的朝鲜人民的团结一致。
    英国代表、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人蒙尼卡·费尔顿夫人接着发言。她说：她不仅是以英国代表团的名义在这里说话，而且是以在朝鲜的许多英国战俘和美国战俘的名义在这里说话——这些战俘已认识到，他们被派去参战时曾受到怎样残酷的欺骗，据说他们被派去参战是为了维护集体安全的原则，在最近若干月中发生的关于战俘问题的一切争论中，只有一个声音——在某些方面可说是最有决定性的声音——没有被听到，这就是战俘本人的声音。
    费尔顿夫人说：三个月以前，她又访问了朝鲜，她知道在鸭绿江岸的战俘营里的许多战俘正在焦急地注意着大会的进展，他们希望全世界人民让他们有机会回国与家人团聚。费尔顿夫人说：战俘们曾要求她对全世界人民说，一定要让各个地方的广大群众认识在过去两年半中对朝鲜人民所犯的罪行的真相。首先是细菌战的事实。费尔顿夫人说：这些罪行仍然没有停止。她在一九五二年所看到的朝鲜的景象比一九五一年的已沦为一片废墟的朝鲜更加令人怵目惊心。因此战俘们要求她到处向人们说明真相——干涉军在朝鲜所犯的暴行的真相。
    费尔顿夫人说：战俘们还提出这样一个问题：他们哪一天才能得到自由呢？他们当中有许多人说：解决战俘问题的办法自然是履行日内瓦公约的条款，无例外地交换全部战俘。他们要求善良的人们揭发“自愿遣返”的骗局——这是战俘们自己说的。
    最后，费尔顿夫人提出了一个提案，英国代表团在这个提案中全体一致敦促大会要求立即在朝鲜停火，作为谈判其他未解决问题的初步条件。
    美国代表乔治·海华德说，美国代表团的代表对于许多代表们要求各大国开始谈判以解决一切问题的发言，深为感动。他说，美国代表团确信：不用任何压力而进行谈判，并使历史进程不走向战争，是可能的……有人对美国人民说，他们的民族独立已受到威胁，难道仅仅因为另一个国家选择了一种不同的生活方式，美国的安全和独立就受到威胁了吗？既然像有人说美国生活方式较为优越，那么又何必害怕两种制度的和平竞赛呢？
    乔治·海华德又说，一个国家要保卫自己的独立，必须也承认其他国家的独立权利。
    由朝鲜战争可以看出，侵犯人民的民族独立的行为已产生了怎样的后果。绝大多数美国人民是谴责朝鲜战争的。
    乔治·海华德说，美国代表团认为必须停止朝鲜战争，而且必须立即这样做。
    接着发言的是从朝鲜遣返的一个加拿大兵士伊冯·杜沙姆。一九五○年，他还只十八岁的时候，因失业，被征募入伍。杜沙姆被派遣到朝鲜去，在朝鲜前线登陆。不久他就受了伤、被送到一个医院里去。杜沙姆说，在那里他遇见了英国、加拿大和菲律宾的兵士。他就开始想：为什么他离开他的祖国而到几千公里以外的朝鲜来呢？所有这些伤兵，想在朝鲜得到什么呢？
    于是，杜沙姆决定了，他必须说出朝鲜战争的真相。他回到加拿大以后，就成为一个争取和平的积极战士。他说，必须要求立即停止朝鲜战争，必须停止一切战争并让青年人回家。
    在上午会议上发言的还有意大利总工会代表裘塞佩·卡萨笛和国际民主法律工作者协会代表约翰·普拉茨—米尔斯。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十六日讯：在世界人民和平大会十五日的晚间会议上，意大利上院议员埃米里奥·塞伦尼、匈牙利天主教神甫雅诺希·麦特、埃及全国和平委员会主席英布拉黑姆·拉夏德、摩洛哥代表阿布杜拉、印度代表阿第提安和法国农民代表拉福雷先后发言。
    塞伦尼谈到了意大利和平运动高涨的情形，他指出：在欧洲和美洲、近东和中东，愈来愈多的人民开始认识，被某些人称为保障国家安全的工具的军事基地，事实上是外国手中的战争和奴役的武器。
    塞伦尼接着谈到五大国缔结和平公约问题。他说：缔结和平公约这种意见，已经得到全世界各国的六亿人民的拥护。人人知道：只有缔结五大国和平公约，大小国家的民族独立与安全与世界和平才能得到可靠的保障。塞伦尼最后说：只有当中国在联合国中取得了正当的地位以后，只有当联合国注意到各国人民的呼声以后，只有在它听取了各国人民希望五大国举行谈判并缔结和平公约的要求以后，联合国才能重新执行它的任务。
    匈牙利天主教神甫雅诺希·麦特代表匈牙利的三千三百四十位教士发言，他说，我们匈牙利天主教教士在讲道时是支持世界持久和平这种神圣事业的。我们认为天主教世界必须发出呼声，谴责可怕的细菌战以及那些应对这种战争负责的人，并要求立即停止朝鲜战争。我们认为使用原子武器和细菌武器是最严重的罪行。他把有着三千三百四十个匈牙利天主教教徒签名的表示匈牙利天主教徒爱好和平的签名簿送给会议主席考涅楚克，作为献给世界和平理事会的礼物。
    埃及代表拉夏德代表埃及人民向大会祝贺。他接着斥责了西方国家在保护埃及的藉口下，正在力图保持它们自己在埃及的地位。拉夏德强调指出：埃及既没有受到侵略的威胁。也不愿意去为那些与我们毫不相干的利益而作战。我们希望各国人民都应该利用一切机会去生产财富并且自由地互相交换财富，以便大家都有好处。
    接着发言的是摩洛哥代表阿布杜拉。他说，在帝国主义者的支配之下，我国已被分割成为法国区、西班牙区和所谓国际区。美国人还在我国的领土上建筑了七个空军基地。法帝国主义者正在蹂躏摩洛哥人民的文化和民族尊严。帝国主义者的统治，已经完全毁灭了我们富饶的国家。饥荒不断降临摩洛哥。阿布杜拉说，摩洛哥人民正为反对外国帝国主义的统治以及争取国家的自由与独立而进行顽强的斗争。
    阿布杜拉说：我国人民对于法国政府的具体要求是：不再在摩洛哥采取警察恐怖行动；立即承认民主自由；建立法国和摩洛哥的新关系以便成立摩洛哥政府，这个政府将在平等基础上与法国缔结新协定并取消保护国的地位。
    接着发言的是印度代表阿第提安。他指出，法国和葡萄牙两国政府在印度沿海一带占有属地，使印度人民经常感到不安。
    最后发言的是法国代表拉福雷，他代表法国农民向大会致敬。他接着叙述了在备战经济下法国农民的艰苦状况。他最后说，在十一月间在巴黎举行的法兰西全国农民和平大会建议大会设法早日结束越南和朝鲜的战争，反对批准波恩条约和巴黎条约，反对军国主义化和扩张军备运动，努力恢复各国之间的经济与文化交流。
