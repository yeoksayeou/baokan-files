Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Paris "Ce Soir" reporter Béquet reports from Kaesong: It is believed here that Eisenhower and MacArthur are busily planning a new military adventure in Korea, which once again proves that the US is deliberately delaying the armistice and expanding the Korean War.

The means by which the United States seeks to obstruct the armistice in the United Nations are the same as the means they seek in Kaesong and Panmunjom. At the armistice negotiation conference, the US has never been willing to easily remove any obstacle it has set up to hinder the agreement; only when they are sure that they have set up a more insurmountable obstacle will they remove the previous one. Because the US is afraid of peace and the serious economic consequences of peace for American capitalists, they always set up an obstacle that is difficult to remove to hinder negotiations, and their only problem is how to find "pleasant" moral words to decorate this obstacle in order to deceive public opinion. In the negotiations, when they made demands about Kaesong, they gave up their unreasonable demand for 12,000 square kilometers of land north of the front line. When they made a demand for unrestricted reconnaissance in various parts of North Korea, they gave up the aforementioned demand for land. When they made a demand for a ban on the construction of airfields, they gave up the demand for reconnaissance in North Korea; after they set up the "voluntary repatriation" fraud, they gave up the demand for a ban on the construction of airfields. Finally, at the United Nations General Assembly, until they issued an ultimatum to the Korean and Chinese sides with the UN stamp, forcing the Korean and Chinese sides to accept the US conditions on the prisoner-of-war issue and agree to the Indian proposal, they gave up their own proposal, even though they knew that the Korean and Chinese sides would not tear up international law and the draft armistice agreement that had already been agreed upon at Panmunjom.

Accepting the Indian proposal means tearing up the Geneva Convention. Doing so would mean that it would be legal in the future to torture prisoners of war, tattoo them, execute them collectively, and use other methods adopted by the US on Geoje Island to force prisoners to betray their country. Doing so would mean that the main task of the country detaining prisoners of war in the future is: whenever a prisoner of war is captured, to immediately use the most barbaric methods to force him to betray his country, to force soldiers to betray their oath of allegiance to the national defense forces of their own country. The people who drafted the Indian proposal knew, just like the US, that no self-respecting country would do such a thing that violates human rights.

It must be pointed out once again: the goal of the United States in the United Nations is to use the forced detention of prisoners of war as a tool for their main plan to prevent the armistice at all costs. They know that the Korean and Chinese side's position in the negotiations has always insisted on strictly abiding by international law, and therefore will never tear up international law. Even before the debate began, and during the debate, the US was openly preparing to continue and expand the war, and now the whole world has clearly seen this. However, no matter whether they launch a so-called "limited" offensive as predicted by fanciful strategists in order to establish a shorter defense line in the waist of Korea, or engage in more ambitious plans, it will only cause unlimited bloodshed for the US and its allies' troops, as well as greater military defeat.

It must also be pointed out once again: if the US is determined to take risks, the Korean and Chinese side has the strength to give them a heavy blow. Today, the Korean and Chinese side is no longer fighting empty-handed. They have the most modern equipment; they have learned how to use this equipment in a very short time, which even American officers have to admire. If Eisenhower and MacArthur continue to send cannon fodder to Korea, all that awaits them is the fate of defeat – whether it be amphibious operations, airlift, frontal attacks, or any other method. The only way for the US to solve the problem it has created is to abide by international law, honor the draft armistice agreement at Panmunjom that they have already agreed to, and sign it. If the prisoner-of-war issue cannot be resolved for the time being, they can implement a ceasefire immediately as Vyshinsky suggested, and let the eleven-nation committee seek a final solution to the prisoner-of-war issue.

    巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌自开城报道
    美方如敢利用联大非法决议进行军事冒险
    必将在朝中部队重大打击下遭到更大失败
    【新华社十六日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌自开城报道：此间认为，艾森豪威尔和麦克阿瑟正在忙忙乱乱地筹划在朝鲜发动新的军事冒险的计划，又一次证明美方蓄意拖延停战和扩大朝鲜战争。
    美国在联合国中所要的阻挠停战的手段，与他们在开城和板门店所要的手段如出一辙。在停战谈判会议上，美方从来不肯轻易除去他们设下的阻挠协议的任何一个障碍，只有在他们确信他们已设下一个更加难以越过的障碍时，他们才肯除去前面的一个障碍。由于美方害怕和平，害怕和平对美国大资本家的严重经济后果，他们无论什么时候总要设下一个难于除去的障碍来阻挠谈判，他们的唯一问题就是如何找到“动听的”道德言词来粉饰这个障碍，借以欺骗舆论。在谈判当中，当他们提出关于开城的要求时，他们才放弃索取战线以北一万二千平方公里土地的蛮不讲理的要求。当他们提出无限制地在北朝鲜各地进行侦察的要求时，他们才放弃前述对于土地的要求。当他们提出关于禁止建筑飞机场的要求时，他们才放弃侦察北朝鲜的要求；在他们设下“自愿遣返”的骗局以后，他们才放弃关于禁止建筑飞机场的要求。最后，在联合国大会上，直到他们向朝中方面发出盖了联合国图章的最后通牒，硬要朝中方面接受美方关于战俘问题的条件而同意印度提案的时候，他们才放弃他们自己的提案，而他们明明知道，朝中方面是不会撕毁国际法和已在板门店取得协议的停战协定草案的。
    接受印度提案就是撕毁日内瓦公约。这样做就意味着将来可以合法地对战俘施以酷刑，在身上刺字，集体处决，以及施用美方为了强迫俘虏背叛祖国而在巨济岛采用的其他办法。这样做就意味着将来拘留战俘的国家的主要任务是：每当一个战俘被俘的时候，立即用最野蛮的办法强迫他背叛他的国家，强迫军人背叛对自己祖国的国防军效忠的誓言。拟订印度提案的人也和美方一样知道，任何一个自尊的国家决不会干这种侵犯人权的勾当。
    必须再一次指出：美国在联合国中的目标就是利用强迫扣留战俘来作为他们的不惜一切代价阻止停战的主要计划的工具。他们知道，朝中方面在谈判中的主张始终坚持严格遵守国际法，因而是决不会撕毁国际法的。甚至在辩论未开始以前，以及在进行辩论期间，美方就在公然准备继续和扩大战争，现在全世界已清楚地看到这一点。不过，不管他们是像耽于空想的战略家所预测的那样发动所谓“有限”攻势，以便在朝鲜腰部建立较短的防线，还是从事野心更大的计划，都只会造成美国及其盟国的军队的无限制的流血，以及更大的军事失败。
    还必须再一次指出：如果美国决心来冒险，朝中方面是有力量给他们一个重大打击的。今天，朝中方面已不再是赤手空拳地作战了。他们有着最现代化的装备；他们在极短的时间中就学会了使用这些装备的方法，这连美国军官们也不得不佩服。如果艾森豪威尔和麦克阿瑟继续送炮灰到朝鲜来，等着他们的只有是失败的命运。——不管两栖作战也罢，空运也罢，正面攻击也罢，或者任何其他方式也罢。美方要想解决它自己制造的难题，唯一的办法是遵守国际法，信守他们已经同意的板门店停战协定草案，并在这个草案上签字。如果战俘问题一时还是不能得到解决，他们可以像维辛斯基建议的那样立即实行停火，让十一国委员会谋求战俘问题的最后解决。
