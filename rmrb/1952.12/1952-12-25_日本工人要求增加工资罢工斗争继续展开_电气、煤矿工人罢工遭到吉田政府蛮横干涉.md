Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Japanese workers' movement to demand wage increases and year-end bonuses is proceeding under increasingly intensified pressure from the reactionary ruling class.

On the evening of the 15th, 10,000 members of the Japan Government and Public Office Workers' Union Council gathered around the National Diet Building in Tokyo, waving red flags and holding demonstrations. The Yoshida government dispatched a large number of police to suppress the demonstrators, resulting in clashes. On the 19th, another 20,000 Tokyo municipal workers held a rally to demand wage increases and year-end bonuses, and they held a demonstration march after the meeting.

Japanese workers driven to work at the US military base in Kanagawa Prefecture also held a 24-hour strike on the 17th to demand wage increases, year-end bonuses, and improved working conditions. This strike brought construction, repair, and transportation work to a standstill at US military bases in Yokosuka and other places. On the 19th, 10,000 Japanese workers employed by the British Commonwealth forces in Hiroshima announced a 72-hour strike to demand wage increases.

The Japanese reactionary ruling clique is using despicable means of suppression and division to undermine the long-term strike struggle of electrical industry workers and coal miners. The Yoshida government is openly interfering in the coal miners' strike, which has lasted for two months. It even blatantly forced coal miners to return to work on the 15th under the fascist labor laws, in order to "mediate." The Central Struggle Committee of the Coal Miners' Union ordered the suspension of the strike on the evening of the 16th. Electrical industry workers resumed work on the 18th after holding 15 consecutive strikes since September 24. During the strike, workers cut off power to major factories for a total of 142 hours. The Yoshida government's barbaric methods once again exposed its shameful face as an agent of the US-Japanese monopoly groups.

    日本工人要求增加工资罢工斗争继续展开
    电气、煤矿工人罢工遭到吉田政府蛮横干涉
    据新华社讯：日本工人要求增加工资和发给年终津贴的斗争运动，正在反动统治阶级压力日益加紧的情况之下进行。
    十五日晚，日本官公厅工会协议会的一万名会员，集合在东京国会大厦的四周，挥舞红旗，举行示威。吉田政府出动大批的警察镇压示威群众，因此引起冲突。十九日又有两万名东京市政工人举行集会，要求增加工资和发给年终津贴，他们并在会后举行了示威游行。
    被驱使在神奈川县美国军事基地工作的日本工人，也因要求增加工资、发给年终津贴和改善工作条件，在十七日举行二十四小时的罢工。这一罢工使横滨和横须贺等地的美国军事基地上的建筑、修理和运输工作陷于停顿。十九日，在广岛有英联邦军所雇用的一万名日本工人宣布举行七十二小时的罢工，要求增加工资。
    日本反动统治集团正以镇压和分裂的卑鄙手段破坏电气产业工人和煤矿工人的长期罢工斗争。吉田政府正公开干涉已坚持了两个月的煤矿工人的罢工。它竟根据法西斯的劳工法规，在十五日横暴地强迫煤矿工人复工，以便“调解”。煤矿工会中央斗争委员会已在十六日晚下令暂停罢工。电气产业工人从九月二十四日起接连举行十五次罢工以后，已在十八日复工。在罢工期间，工人曾先后对大工厂停电一百四十二小时。吉田政府的蛮横手段，再度暴露出它是美、日垄断集团的代理人的可耻面目。
