    Jiujiang Railway Station Chief Should Act in Accordance with Ministry of Railways Regulations

    Editor: Li Xianglan, the Jiujiang Railway Station Chief of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, does not act in accordance with the regulations of the Central Ministry of Railways, nor does he conduct thorough inspections of work, resulting in chaos throughout the station. The station has six sets of points, but only two sets of frequently unused points are locked; the remaining four sets are not locked as required. The dispatchers in the operations room have stopped recording the "Traffic Log for Marshalling Stations" stipulated by the Ministry of Railways since September 27th. On November 3rd, when the Shanghai Railway Administration Statistics Office came to the station to inspect statistical performance and asked the dispatchers for traffic log data, the dispatchers could not produce it and lied, saying, "The logbook is locked in the box, and the person with the key is not here, so there's no way to open it."

    The station does not prepare statistical reports as required, such as failing to include the loading car number list, loading capacity list, and number of loading and unloading cars in the statistical reports. The station also engages in falsely reporting achievements. For example, in October of this year, the freight volume was overstated by more than 900 tons, and the average daily vehicle dwell time was understated by 40 to 50 hours. In August of this year, the station had two incidents of responsibility accidents involving stopping the train to catch pigs due to improper loading, and pig-catching incidents also occurred on October 30th and 31st.

    The station also neglects safety education for loading and unloading workers. Therefore, I hope that the Nanchang Railway Bureau will send someone to Jiujiang Railway Station to inspect the work, and I hope that Station Chief Li Xianglan will make a profound self-criticism.

### 九江车站站长应按照铁道部规章办事

    九江车站站长应按照铁道部规章办事
    编辑同志：南昌铁路分局九江车站站长李向岚，不按照中央铁道部的规章制度办事，不深入检查工作，使得整个车站很混乱。该站有六付道岔，但只有两付经常不动的道岔加锁，其余四付道岔都不按规定加锁。运转室的运转员，自九月二十七日起就停止了铁道部规定的“编组站的行车日志”的登记工作。十一月三日上海铁路管理局统计处到该站检查统计成绩，向该站运转员要行车日志资料时，运转员交不出来，就欺骗说：“日志本锁进箱子去了，现在人不在，没办法开箱子。”
    该站不按照规定做统计表报，如在统计表报内，没有填装车车号清单、装载量清单、装卸车数等。该站还有伪报成绩的现象。在今年十月份的货物发送数，就多报了九百多吨，平均每日要少报车辆停留时间四、五十小时之多。今年八月间，该站曾发生两件因装载不良而在中途停车捉猪的责任事故，在十月三十日、三十一日也发生捉猪事故。
    该站对于装卸工人的安全教育，也不重视。因此，我希望南昌铁路分局派人到九江车站检查工作，并希望李向岚站长作深刻检讨。　效　廉
