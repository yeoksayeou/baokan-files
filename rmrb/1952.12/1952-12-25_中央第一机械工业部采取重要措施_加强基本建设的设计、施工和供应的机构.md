The Central First Ministry of Machine Building is actively mobilizing forces to establish and strengthen the design, construction, and material supply organizations for basic construction in order to welcome the major construction projects of next year.

The basic construction tasks of the First Ministry of Machine Building next year will be four times that of this year. These tasks include large-scale new enterprises designed by foreign countries, large-scale new enterprises designed entirely by ourselves, and the reconstruction or expansion of existing enterprises. When the ministry was established in September this year, its factory design force was only equivalent to 25% of next year's task, the force to cooperate with foreign design work had basically not yet been organized, and the construction force was even weaker than the design force, and there was no unified organization or leadership. In light of this situation, the ministry has determined that one of its current central tasks is to establish design and construction organizations for basic construction.

The ministry originally had only three directly subordinate industrial bureaus: Machinery, Automobile, and Shipbuilding. In order to strengthen the leadership of basic construction and production, four machinery industrial bureaus and one electrical industrial bureau have now been established, bringing the total to seven bureaus including the Automobile and Shipbuilding Industrial Bureaus. It is planned to first transfer 850 cadres from the Northeast and East China Industrial Sub-bureaus to strengthen these organizations. These cadres are currently being concentrated one after another. At the same time, the ministry has transferred cadres from the original East China Ministry of Industry to strengthen the internal organizations of the ministry, especially the Planning Department and the Basic Construction Department. So far, the first batch of 89 people transferred from East China have arrived, and the second batch will arrive within days. At the same time, the ministry held consecutive meetings of relevant department and bureau chiefs this month to review and approve next year's planned tasks, and carefully calculated next year's basic construction investment. Projects that were dispensable, could be postponed, or were uncertain were all reduced. The reduction amounted to about 15% of the original total investment. This truly implemented the policy of concentrating resources on key construction projects.

Strengthening the design, construction, and supply departments is the key to ensuring the completion of next year's tasks. The ministry has taken the following important measures:

First, establish a strong and centralized design organization. According to the ministry's tasks for next year, a total of 3,000 factory designers are needed, while the original number of designers was only 850, and they were scattered in various regional bureaus and enterprises. Past experience has proven that the decentralized use of designers has several shortcomings: data and talents are not easy to adjust, resulting in a waste of manpower; quotas are not easy to control, resulting in overestimation or underestimation; technical levels are uneven, making it difficult to improve. Based on Soviet experience, the ministry has decided to establish a centralized design organization to be responsible for all factory design work; branch organizations will be established according to industry or key construction areas. It has now been determined to concentrate design forces in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang as priorities, and 350 technical cadres have been transferred from the production departments. It is expected that 2,000 people will be concentrated by the end of this year. The current design work is focused on preparing and reviewing design task books and preliminary designs, and it is stipulated that the preliminary designs for key construction projects to be started next year must be completed before April next year.

Second, establish a centralized construction management organization. The ministry has now formed a Basic Construction Bureau, which is responsible for construction and installation tasks. The ministry's original construction force could only complete 400,000 square meters of tasks per year. Now, the East China side has allocated a construction force that can complete approximately 400,000 square meters of tasks per year. However, these forces can only bear a small portion of next year's construction tasks. Therefore, the ministry has decided to use 7% of next year's total basic construction investment to expand the construction and installation forces, and has planned to establish four engineering offices in North China; five construction engineering companies and one installation company in the Northeast; and one construction and installation company and one installation engineering team in East China. After the development this winter and next year, the construction force is expected to be able to undertake 60% of the total engineering tasks next year. The remaining 40% of the tasks will still need to be completed by the Central Construction Engineering Department and regional construction forces. At present, the central task of the Basic Construction Bureau is to expand its forces while organizing winter training.

Third, establish a national supply and marketing system. The factory design and building material supply work for basic construction is very heavy, especially the foreign supply issue, which is a major key related to whether the task can be completed. One of the main reasons why the basic construction plans for several important enterprises could not be completed this year was the untimely supply of equipment. If this work is not specifically handled by a strong organization, it will be a serious threat to basic construction. The ministry has established a Supply Bureau and a Sales Bureau, and has established supply and marketing sub-bureaus in East China, North China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest. It is currently sorting out problems, understanding the situation, and striving to change the past passive situation.

In mobilizing forces to strengthen basic construction organizations, the ministry has focused on grasping two main issues. First, ensure all levels of leading cadres have a shared understanding. The main source of cadres is transfers from the production departments. To resolve the contradiction between the need for cadres, especially technical cadres, in production and basic construction, it is necessary to make the leading cadres of enterprises realize that although there are not enough cadres in production either, there is a foundation compared to the basic construction departments, and new forces can be quickly cultivated in production. At the National Electrical Industry Professional Conference convened by the ministry in mid-November, the minister and bureau chiefs made mobilization reports, calling on production departments to transfer a large number of cadres to the basic construction departments. After discussing these reports, representatives of enterprises in various regions more deeply realized the importance of basic construction, criticized the erroneous view of not wanting to transfer cadres, and formulated plans to transfer technical cadres from the production departments. Second, leading cadres personally calculated the existing forces and the implementation plan for expanding forces in the future. After the establishment of the ministry, the minister personally repeatedly studied and discussed this issue with the bureau chiefs and relevant department chiefs, and formulated a plan to concentrate design forces and expand construction forces.

Establishing organizations and mobilizing forces are only the beginning of the work. From mid-this month, the minister has chaired the organization of bureau chiefs and relevant department chiefs to review and approve next year's plan and the plans for the next few years. It is expected that this work will be completed within a month. Various specific preparatory work for basic construction will be further developed accordingly.

    中央第一机械工业部采取重要措施
    加强基本建设的设计、施工和供应的机构
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部，积极调集力量，建立与充实基本建设的设计、施工、材料供应等机构，以迎接明年的大建设。
    第一机械工业部明年的基本建设任务相当于今年的四倍。其中有委托国外设计的大型新企业和全部由自己设计的大型新企业，改建或扩充原有的企业。该部在今年九月成立时，工厂设计力量仅有相当明年任务的百分之二十五，配合国外设计工作的力量基本上尚未组织，而施工力量比设计力量还弱，并且没有统一的组织和领导。根据这种情况，该部确定当前的中心任务之一是建立基本建设的设计与施工机构。
    该部原有直属工业局仅机器、汽车和船舶三个局。为了加强基本建设与生产的领导，现已成立四个机器工业局，一个电器工业局，连同汽车和船舶工业局共计有七个局。并计划首先从东北、华东两区工业分局抽调八百五十名干部充实上述机构。这些干部目前已陆续集中。同时，该部又从原华东工业部抽调干部加强部内机构，特别是计划司和基本建设司。到目前为止，从华东抽调的第一批人员八十九人已经到达，第二批人员日内亦将到达。同时，该部在本月份内连续召开了有关司、局长会议，审定明年的计划任务，详细计算了明年基本建设投资，凡属可办可不办、可缓办或无把握的项目，都给核减了，核减数目约为原定投资总额的百分之十五。这样便真正贯彻了集中力量办好重点建设的方针。
    加强设计、施工和供应部门的力量是保证完成明年任务的关键，该部已采取如下重要措施：
    第一，建立强大的和集中的设计机构。按照该部明年任务，共需工厂设计人员三千人，而原有设计人员仅八百五十名，且分散在各地区局和企业中。过去的经验证明，分散使用设计人员有几个缺点：资料及人材不易调剂，因而浪费人力；定额不易控制，偏高偏低；技术水平不齐，不易提高。根据苏联经验，该部已决定成立集中的设计机构，负责全部工厂设计工作；按照行业或重点建设地区设立分支机构。现已确定以北京、上海和沈阳为重点集中设计力量，并已由生产部门抽调技术干部三百五十人，今年年底预计集中至二千人。目前的设计工作正抓紧编制和审查设计任务书和初步设计，并规定凡属明年施工的重点建设必须于明年四月以前完成初步设计。
    第二，建立集中的施工管理机构。该部现已组成基本建设局，负责建筑和安装任务。该部原有建筑力量每年仅能完成四十万平方公尺的任务，现在又由华东方面拨来每年约完成四十万平方公尺任务的建筑力量，但这些力量仍只能负担明年工程任务的小部分。因此，该部已确定使用明年基本建设总投资的百分之七来扩大建筑和安装力量，并已计划在华北区设立四个工程处；东北设五个建筑工程公司和一个安装公司；华东设立一个建筑安装公司和一个安装工程队。经过今冬和明年的发展，施工力量预计可以担负明年全部工程任务的百分之六十。其余百分之四十的任务，还须依靠中央建筑工程部及地区施工力量来完成。目前，基本建设局的中心任务是一面扩大力量，一面组织冬季训练。
    第三，建立全国供销系统。基本建设的工厂设计和建筑材料的供应工作是非常繁重的，特别是国外供应问题，更是关系着能否完成任务的重大关键。今年若干重要企业的基本建设计划不能完成的主要原因之一，便是设备供应不及时。这个工作如果不由
    一个强有力的机构来专门负责，对于基本建设将是
    一个严重的威胁。该部已成立供应局和销售局，并在华东、华北、中南、西南和西北等区成立供销分局。目前正在整理问题，摸清情况，力争改变过去被动的情况。
    在调集力量加强基本建设机构中，该部着重掌握了两个主要问题。第一，打通各级领导干部思想。干部的主要来源是从生产部门抽调。要解决生产与基本建设需要干部特别是技术干部的矛盾，必须使企业的领导干部认识到：生产中的干部虽也不够，但比起基本建设部门来是有基础的，而且在生产中还可以迅速地培养出新的力量来。十一月中旬该部召开的全国电器工业专业会议上，部长和局长做了动员报告，号召生产部门向基本建设部门大量输送干部。各地区企业代表讨论了这些报告后，更深刻地认识到基本建设的重要性，批判了不愿抽调干部的错误观点，并定出了由生产部门抽调技术干部的计划。第二，领导干部亲自动手计算现有力量和今后需要扩大力量的实施方案。该部成立后，部长曾亲自和各局长及有关司长反复研究和讨论这个问题，制订了集中设计力量和扩大施工力量的计划。
    建立机构和调集力量还仅仅是工作的开始，该部已从本月中旬起由部长主持组织各局局长和各有关司长审定明年计划和今后数年计划，预计一个月内完成这项工作。基本建设的各项具体准备工作，将随之进一步开展。
