Xinhua News Agency, December 8th:

    Khmer representative to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, Mr. Kao Sang, member of the Executive Committee of the Khmer Cotton East Free Democratic United Front, was delayed on his journey and unable to attend the Peace Conference. After arriving in Beijing, he delivered a special radio address, expressing his endorsement of the various resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The full text of his speech is as follows:
    The Khmer people are peace-loving. When the Khmer Committee for the Defense of World Peace heard the news that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference would be held in Beijing, it held a meeting and decided to send me to represent the Khmer people at this conference.
    Due to the difficulties and remoteness of the journey, by the time I arrived in Beijing, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference had already closed. I regret that I could not participate in the conference or meet with all the representatives of the various countries.
    However, I was able to meet with representatives from Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Malaya, as well as some representatives from other countries. They briefed me on the conference, and especially friends from China, Vietnam, and Laos helped me in various ways, enabling me to further understand the conference situation. I have read all the conference documents. The brilliant achievements of the conference made me very happy. The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region hate the imperialist war bloc headed by the United States, and the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region are united and fighting to defend peace. The various resolutions of the conference not only conform to the wishes of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region but also conform to the wishes of the people of the world. In particular, the resolution on national independence issues; advocating that all nations have the right to self-determination, that no country can infringe upon the sovereignty and territory of other countries, that no country can interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, Japan, etc., including Laos and Cambodia. This is the first time that the issue of national independence has been clearly and specifically raised in all peace conferences. The statement that "peace is inseparable from national independence" is completely correct.
    I would like to make the following statement on behalf of the Khmer people:
    The Khmer people fully agree with the various resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing and will actively publicize and implement these resolutions.
    For more than seven years, the Khmer people, like the Vietnamese and Laotian people, have suffered from the renewed aggression of the French colonialists. American interventionists are doing their utmost to assist the French colonial aggressors and are attempting to turn the three countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into a base for a third world war. They plunder the property of the Khmer people, destroy crops and food, and burn temples and villages. They massacre Khmer elders, women, and children. They sow discord among the Khmer people, between the Khmer people and the Vietnamese people, the Laotian people, and the people of other countries. They use all kinds of barbaric means in an attempt to conquer the Khmer people and deceive the people of the world.
    However, the Khmer people all realize that it is the French colonialists and American interventionists who are infringing upon and undermining the independence and peace of the Khmer people. The Khmer people are determined to unite closely with the Vietnamese and Laotian people in the Joint National United Front of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, to oppose the French aggressors and American interventionists, and are determined to unite closely with the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, to oppose the imperialist war instigators headed by the United States. The Khmer people are fighting for their own independence and at the same time contributing their strength to the defense of world peace.
    Therefore, when the Khmer people learned that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference would be held in Beijing, they were very excited. Now that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has been successful, this makes us even more excited.
    I would like to express my gratitude to the representatives of the various countries in the Asian and Pacific region for their concern for the Khmer people's resistance and for their support for the Khmer people's struggle for independence, freedom, and peace. I know that the Chinese people have made great contributions to the holding of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing. As for myself, since arriving in China, I have received the warm care of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Chinese people. I would especially like to thank the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Chinese people.
    I have not been in China for long, but everywhere I have been, I have seen the Chinese people working enthusiastically and happily, and engaged in construction in an intense manner. These scenes excite me and strengthen my confidence in China. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are a great force for defending world peace and are good friends of all nations struggling for liberation.
    For more than seven years, the people of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos have worked hard to resist aggression and have achieved great victories. We will resolutely fight for a long time until there is not a single aggressor left on the territories of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. The Khmer people believe that only in this way can we live up to the sympathy and friendship of the people of the Asian and Pacific region and the people of the whole world, and only in this way can the Khmer people achieve true national independence and contribute their strength to the cause of peace in the Asian and Pacific region and the world.
    Down with the imperialist war instigators!
    Long live world peace!

    高棉出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表
    高桑发表广播演说拥护和平会议决议
    【新华社八日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的高棉代表、高棉棉东自由民主统一战线执行委员会委员高桑，因旅途迟滞未能参加和平会议，抵京后特发表广播演说，表示拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各项决议。讲词全文如下：
    高棉人民是热爱和平的。当高棉保卫世界和平委员会听到亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将在北京召开的消息的时候，就举行了会议，并决定派遣我代表高棉人民来出席这个会议。
    由于路途困难和遥远，当我到达北京的时候，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已经闭幕了。很遗憾，我不能参加会议也不能和所有的各国代表见面。
    但我还能和越南、寮国、泰国和马来亚代表以及其他国家的部分代表会面。他们向我介绍了会议的情况，特别是中国、越南和寮国的朋友们从各方面来帮助我，使我对会议情况有了更进一步的了解。我看过会议所有的文件。会议的辉煌成就，使我觉得很愉快。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民都仇恨以美国为首的帝国主义战争集团，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民团结一致，正在为保卫和平而斗争。会议的各项决议不但符合亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的愿望而且还符合世界人民的愿望。特别是关于民族独立问题的决议；主张各民族都有自决权，任何国家都不能侵犯别国的主权和领土，不得干涉别国的内政，所有的外国军队要撤出朝鲜、越南、马来亚、日本等，其中也包括寮国和高棉。在所有的和平会议中，明白而具体地提出民族独立问题，这是第一次。和平与“民族独立是分不开的”，这句话完全正确。
    我谨代表高棉人民发表如下的声明：
    高棉人民完全赞成在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项决议，并将积极宣传和执行这些决议。
    七年多以来，高棉人民和越南、寮国人民一样，遭受了法国殖民者再次的侵略。美国干涉者正在极力援助法国殖民侵略者，并且企图将越南、高棉和寮国等三个国家变为第三次世界大战的根据地。他们掠夺高棉人民的财产，破坏庄稼、粮食、烧毁庙宇和村庄。他们残杀高棉的父老、妇女和儿童。他们挑拨高棉人民之间的关系，挑拨高棉人民与越南人民，寮国人民以及其他各国人民之间的关系，他们采用各种野蛮的手段，企图征服高棉人民和欺骗世界人民。
    但高棉人民都认识到：侵犯和破坏高棉人民的独立与和平的，就是法国殖民者和美国干涉者。高棉人民决心和越南、寮国人民紧密地团结在越南、寮国、高棉三国联合民族统一战线中，反对法国侵略者和美国干涉者，并且决心和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营紧密团结，反对以美国为首的帝国主义战争挑拨者。高棉人民为争取自己的独立而抗战，同时为保卫世界和平而贡献出自己的力量。
    因此，当高棉人民知道亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将在北京召开的时候，他们是十分兴奋的。现在，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已经获得成功，这更使我们兴奋。
    我对亚洲及太平洋区域各国代表关心高棉人民的抗战，并支持高棉人民争取独立、自由、和平的斗争表示感谢。我知道中国人民对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在北京的召开作出了巨大的贡献。在我本人来说，自从到中国以来，就得到中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民的殷勤照顾，我特别向中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民致谢。
    我到中国来还不久，但所有到过的地方，我都看到了中国人民正在热情愉快地工作，正在紧张地进行建设，这些情景使我感到兴奋，并且加强了我对中国的信心。中国人民在毛主席领导下，是保卫世界和平的伟大力量，是正在为争取解放而斗争的各民族的好朋友。
    七年多来，高棉、越南和寮国人民努力抗战，已经获得了巨大的胜利。我们将坚决长期抗战，直到高棉、越南、寮国的领土上再没有一个侵略者为止。高棉人民认为：只有这样，才不辜负亚洲及太平洋区域人民和全世界人民对高棉人民的同情和友谊，也只有这样，高棉人民才能取得真正的民族独立并为亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界和平事业贡献出自己的力量。
    打倒帝国主义战争挑拨者！
    世界和平万岁！
