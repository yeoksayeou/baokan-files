Introducing the "Russian Language Teaching" Magazine
Shi Qian

“Russian Language Teaching” is the official publication of the National Russian Language Teaching Steering Committee of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, edited by the “Russian Language Teaching” Editorial Board. Its target audience includes leading cadres in Russian language teaching, Russian language teachers, students, and self-learners of Russian. The task of this publication is, on the one hand, to introduce the advanced experience of Soviet language teaching, explore methods of Russian language teaching in our country, and exchange experiences in Russian language teaching in our country; on the other hand, to introduce knowledge of Russian phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary.

Since its inception, “Russian Language Teaching” has published seven issues. The characteristic of these seven issues is that they first pay attention to the theoretical guidance of Russian language teaching. For example, the article "On the Tasks and Methods of Teaching Russian in Our Schools Based on Stalin's Works on Linguistics," in conjunction with the characteristics of Russian language teaching in our country, selectively introduced the joint meeting of the Department of Literature and Language of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Russian Academy of Educational Sciences on language teaching issues after the publication of Comrade Stalin's works on linguistics. This decision is the basic program and direction of Soviet language teaching, and it is also a practical instruction for Russian language teaching in our country. The article discusses the significance of Stalin's works on linguistics for language teaching, points out the position of grammar, vocabulary, and semantics in language teaching, and proposes various basic principles of foreign language teaching methods. The article "On Some Methods in Foreign Language Teaching Based on Comrade Stalin's Works on Linguistics" elaborates on the role of the native language in foreign language teaching, that is, the use of the comparative method in foreign language teaching; it also provides a detailed analysis of the principles of vocabulary explanation, the role of grammar and semantics, and methods of teaching phonetics. The article "The Development of the Russian Language in the Soviet Era" explains the development of the Russian language and discusses the use of loanwords and dialects. The article "A Brief Discussion on Several Issues in Russian Translation" discusses the attitude of translators and the methods of written and oral translation. The editorial recently published in the latest issue, entitled "Improve Russian Language Teaching and Strive to Rapidly and Massively Cultivate Russian Language Talents," summarizes the achievements of Russian language teaching in our country over the past three years and puts forward the central tasks for the next two or three years. The issues discussed in the above articles are what our Russian language teachers, especially Russian language teaching leaders, should first study diligently. Only by clarifying these issues can we clearly understand our work tasks and goals.

Constantly improving the level of organization and leadership in Russian language teaching is an extremely important task for Russian language teachers. In this regard, the journal has published special articles on several urgent issues that need to be resolved in the current teaching organization and leadership work, such as the formulation and implementation of teaching plans and syllabuses, the organization and work of Russian language teaching and research sections, and the work of Russian language resource rooms. It has also successively introduced the experience of Russian language teaching organization and leadership in Russian language specialized schools, university Russian language departments (groups), middle schools, Russian language broadcasting schools, and spare-time schools.

Improving teaching methods is one of the important tasks of Russian language teachers today. This is especially important for some comrades who have just started teaching Russian and for Russian language teachers who still lack research on Russian language teaching. Because the quality of teaching is directly related to the quality of teaching. "Russian Language Teaching" publishes more articles on this topic in each issue. For example, the article "Improving Speaking and Writing Skills" proposes specific solutions in terms of accumulating and expanding vocabulary, cultivating sentence-making ability, and cultivating the ability to use connecting sentences, and lists examples for explanation. The article "Explaining New Words" introduces in detail the methods of explaining new words, such as using actions, translations, synonyms and antonyms, and grammatical analysis. Regarding several relatively important issues in grammar teaching, such as the position of grammar classes in Russian language teaching, the relationship between syntax and morphology, the coordination of reading classes and grammar classes, how to give full play to the strengths of Chinese and Soviet teachers in grammar teaching, teaching steps, teaching materials and teaching methods, and the preparation before, during, and after grammar teaching, the journal has provided preliminary answers. Theoretical guidance has also been provided on phonetics teaching and translation teaching (including Russian-Chinese and Chinese-Russian translation), and experiences have been introduced.

Self-learners of Russian can find the field they love in "Russian Language Teaching": "Introduction to Learning Experience" and "Introduction to Self-Study Experience". From here, they can find methods of mastering texts, previewing texts, memorizing new words, learning grammar, and reading Russian novels.

In addition to publishing articles on Russian language teaching methods, the journal also systematically introduces various knowledge about the Russian language. "Grammar Lectures" systematically covered nouns up to the fifth issue; starting from the sixth issue, thematic explanations will be given with emphasis, first introducing the meaning and usage of the "tense" and "aspect" of verbs. "Translation Lectures" explore the different expressions of grammatical categories such as "number", "gender", "tense", and "aspect" in the two languages, as well as the different expressions of word order, interrogative sentence patterns, additional components such as cause and purpose, and copulas in the two languages, starting from the grammar of Chinese and Russian languages and their different characteristics. Various issues in phonetics and vocabulary are also systematically explained by "Vocabulary Lectures" and "Phonetics, Reading and Spelling Lectures". Certain issues in Russian are resolved through thematic research, problem discussions, and other methods.

Recently, the journal introduced the experimental experience of speed-reading methods for Russian professional books (including the experience of compiling and selecting teaching materials), and introduced the learning experience of some professors.

How to lead and organize Russian language teaching, how to teach Russian well, and how to learn Russian well are issues that Russian language teachers are concerned about. "Russian Language Teaching" will devote the most space to solving the above problems in the future, so that it can become a better publication to guide Russian language learning.

    介绍“俄文教学”杂志
    史迁
    “俄文教学”，是中央人民政府教育部全国俄文教学指导委员会的机关刊物，由“俄文教学”编辑委员会编辑。它的读者对象，包括俄语教学工作的领导干部、俄语教师、学生和自修俄语者。这一刊物的任务，一方面，介绍苏联语文教学的先进经验，探讨我国俄语教学的方法，交流我国俄语教学的经验；另一方面，介绍俄语的语音、语法和词汇等知识。
    “俄文教学”创刊以来，已经出版了七期。这七期的特点是，它首先注意了俄语教学的理论指导。如“根据斯大林关于语言学的著作论我国学校中讲授俄文的任务与方法”一文，结合着我国俄语教学的特点，择要地介绍了斯大林同志关于语言学的著作发表以后苏联科学院文学语言部和苏俄教育科学院联席会议关于语文教学问题的决定。这一决定是苏联语言教学工作的基本纲领和方向，对我国俄语教学工作同样是切实的指示。文中论及斯大林关于语言学的著作对语言教学的意义，指出语法、词汇和语义学在语言教学中的地位，并提出了外国语教授法的各项基本原理。“根据斯大林同志关于语言学的著作论外国语教学中一些方法”一文，对本国语在外国语教学中的作用问题，即外国语教学中运用比较法这一问题，作了较详细的论述；对词汇的讲解原则、语法和语义学的作用以及教授语音的方法，都作了具体的分析。“苏维埃时代俄罗斯语言的发展”一文，说明了俄罗斯语言的发展，并论述了外来语和方言的运用问题。“略谈俄文翻译工作中的若干问题”一文，论述了翻译工作者的态度，和笔译、口译的方法。最近一期发表的题为“改进俄文教学工作，为迅速地大量地培养俄文人才而努力”的社论，概述了三年来我国俄语教学工作的成就，并提出了今后两三年内的中心任务。上面几篇文章所论述的问题，是我们俄语教学工作者，特别是俄语教学领导工作者首先应当潜心研究的。只有弄清了这些问题，我们才能明确认识自己的工作任务和目标。
    不断地提高俄语教学的组织、领导工作水平，是俄语教学工作者的极重要的任务。该刊在这方面曾就目前教学组织领导工作中若干迫切需要解决的问题：如教学计划和教学大纲的制定和贯彻、俄语教研室的组织和工作、俄语资料室的工作等，发表了专文，并陆续介绍了各地俄语专门学校、大学俄语系（组）、中学、俄语广播学校和业余学校关于俄语教学组织领导工作的经验。
    改进教授方法，是目前俄语教学者的重要任务之一。对于某些刚从事俄语教学工作的同志和对俄语教学还缺乏研究的俄语教学工作者来说，这一点尤为重要。因为教授方法的优劣，直接关系到教学的质量。“俄文教学”每期都以较多的篇幅刊登关于这方面的文章。例如“提高说话和写作能力”一文，在积累和扩充词汇、培养造句能力和培养运用联系语句的能力等方面分别地提出具体的解决办法，并列举实例作了说明。“讲解生词”一文，详细地介绍了讲解生词的方法，如利用动作、翻译、同义词和反义词的语法分析等等。对语法教学中的几个比较重要的问题：例如语法课在俄语教学中的地位、句法和词法的关系、讲读课和语法课的配合、语法讲授中如何发挥中苏教员的长处、教学步骤、教材和教授法，以及语法教学的课前准备、课堂讲授和课后工作等等问题，该刊都作了初步的回答。关于语音教学和翻译教学（包括俄文译中文和中文译俄文），也从理论上进行了指导，并介绍了经验。
    自修俄语者翻开“俄文教学”，可以找到他们自己所爱好的园地：“学习经验介绍”和“自修经验介绍”。他们从这里可以找到掌握课文、预习课文、记生词、学语法、阅读俄文小说的方法。
    除了刊登关于俄语教学方法的文章以外，该刊还系统地介绍有关俄语的各种知识。“语法讲座”到第五期为止，系统地讲完了名词；从第六期开始，将有重点地作专题讲解，首先介绍动词的“时”和“体”的意义和用法。“翻译讲座”，从中俄两种语言的语法及其不同特点出发，探讨了“数”、“类”、“时”、“体”等语法范畴在两种语言中的不同表现法，以及词序、疑问句式和原因与目的等附加成分、系词等在两种语言中的不同表现法。对于语音和词汇方面的各种问题，也分别由“词汇讲座”和“语音、读法和拼写讲座”进行系统的讲解。对于俄语中的某些问题，则用专题研究、问题讨论等方式给予解决。
    最近，该刊介绍了俄文专业书籍阅读速成法的试验经验（包括编选教材经验），并介绍了某些教授的学习体会。
    怎样领导并组织俄语教学工作、怎样教好俄语、怎样学好俄语等问题，是俄语教学工作者所关心的问题。“俄文教学”今后将以最多的篇幅来解决上述问题，使它成为更好的指导俄语学习的刊物。
