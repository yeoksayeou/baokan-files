	Moscow—Beijing
	B. A. Alexandrov, Director of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble
	The Soviet people have always been very concerned about the lives of the Chinese people who are friendly to them. The Chinese people's struggle for liberation has always aroused the warmest resonance in the hearts of the Soviet people. In the Chinese people's nearly thirty years of liberation struggle, the Soviet people have regarded every victory and every achievement of the Chinese people on the front of the struggle for freedom and independence as their own victory and felt delighted. The Soviet people have always been concerned about the lives of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people's love of freedom has deeply moved us. Therefore, the members of our Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble are naturally very happy to become familiar with the art of the Chinese people and understand their achievements.
	We watched the following Chinese films with great interest in Moscow: "The White-Haired Girl," "Liberated China," "Steel Warrior," "Daughters of China," and "Invisible Front." Chinese dramas are being performed in Moscow's theaters: "The White-Haired Girl" is being performed at the Vakhtangov Theater, and "Romance of the West Chamber" is being performed at the Satire Theater.
	We have read the Russian translation of "Hurricane," written by Zhou Libo, which won the Stalin Third Class Prize. We are also familiar with the Russian translations of the works of the great Chinese writer Lu Xun. Our children love the Chinese fairy tale "The Liu Brothers." Moscow Radio also broadcast a script adapted from this fairy tale. Tens of thousands of Muscovites visited the outstanding Chinese art exhibition. The Chinese singers, musicians, dancers, and acrobatic troupes gave Soviet audiences a deep impression during their tour in the Soviet Union last year. We have also seen exquisitely crafted Chinese handicrafts. These handicrafts are displayed in the Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow and the gift exhibition room where people from all countries present gifts to Comrade Stalin, the great leader of progressive humanity.
	The ballet "The Red Poppy," created by Soviet artists with China as its theme, has been performed in Soviet opera houses for twenty-five years. The music for "The Red Poppy" was composed by the outstanding Soviet composer of the older generation, Glière. The image of the female protagonist, Tao Hua (Poppy) Girl, in the ballet is one of the great artistic achievements of the ballerina Ulanova, who visited China not long ago.
	The Moscow folk song and dance troupe's program includes the Chinese folk waist drum dance. Long before our Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble came to China, our performance program included the "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and Moratteli's "Moscow—Beijing."
	Thus, although we live and work in the Soviet Union, we already have many impressions of China, enabling us to have a preliminary understanding of the lives of the Chinese people, their struggle for liberation, and their artistic talent. Of course, having come to the People's Republic of China, our impressions have become infinitely richer. First of all, we have felt, time and again, the Chinese people's deep love for the Soviet people and their great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin. In major cities in China, we have been welcomed with friendship and warm hospitality, which is an expression of the Chinese people's friendship and love for the Soviet people, the Soviet army, and Comrade Stalin. During the song and dance ensemble's performances, at mass rallies, and at welcome and farewell parties, we have deeply felt the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people towards the people of our country, and the great strength of the unity between our two great nations. This feeling of excitement has encouraged us to perform enthusiastically and happily for the working people of China.
	The skills of the Chinese actors, singers, dancers, musicians, and folk artists have given us great artistic enjoyment. We have watched Chinese classical dramas with great interest, which artistically embody the Chinese people's desire for freedom and a happy life. The moving emotions and heroic images in these ancient legendary operas are fascinating. The experiences of the opera protagonists in fighting against the dark forces of evil and ignorance, and for justice and the happy life of the working people, are familiar and understandable to us.
	In opera performances, the actors combine singing, movements, dialogue, and expressions very harmoniously. The actors' lifelike postures, flowing steps, heartfelt singing, and exciting acting are the characteristics of each play.
	What interested us most in the performance program were the ancient and modern folk tunes played by singers and instrumentalists. The loud and clear voices of the Chinese male and female singers stirred our emotions.
	Innate beauty and flexibility, as well as a high degree of skill, are the characteristics of Chinese dancers' art. We very much like the Chinese folk waist drum dance. In this simple and beautiful dance form, unique to folk art, the majestic pace of the victors who have freed themselves from the shackles of long-term slavery is displayed. The director of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble's dance team, Honored Artist and Stalin Prize winner Pavel Virsky, plans to complete his new creative project in Moscow—creating a dance on the theme of Sino-Soviet friendship, and he is collecting all the necessary materials.
	We are particularly pleased and excited to know that there are many cultural work troupes in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Each of these troupes is a younger brother of our Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, which has just turned twenty-four years old. I heartily congratulate our younger brothers—the troop cultural work troupes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—on their further achievements in their creative work. Let the big family of cultural work troupes of China and all New Democratic countries grow and consolidate! The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble is always happy to use its own creative experience to help the artistic development of the troops in our brotherly countries.
	In China, we saw magnificent ancient buildings—the Summer Palace, the Forbidden City, and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, and many scenic spots in Hangzhou. We saw the great power of the Chinese people's artistic genius. The Chinese people created these outstanding buildings, wood carvings, and stone carvings, and carved beautiful and exquisitely artistic patterns on various utensils, which fill every museum in China.
	After returning to Moscow, we will immediately organize an exhibition to display the large number of gifts given to us by the Chinese people, in order to introduce the culture and art of the Chinese people to the Soviet people. The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble will perform Chinese songs and dances in the Soviet Union. We believe that our song and dance ensemble's performance of these songs and dances will be warmly welcomed, just as Soviet songs and dances are warmly welcomed among the Chinese people.
	Finally, on behalf of all members of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, I sincerely thank the Chinese people for the warm hospitality they have given us; thank the Chinese comrades from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the troops who worked with us, because they organized our performances very well and greatly helped the success of our work.
	The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble has been working in China with extreme pleasure and high creative excitement. All of our comrades are willing to contribute our labor to further consolidate the friendship between the peoples of our two great nations, the Soviet Union and China, and to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.
	Long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship and strong alliance between the peoples of our two great nations, the Soviet Union and China!
	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
	Glory to Marshal J.V. Stalin, the great leader and teacher of all progressive humanity and the best friend of the Chinese people!

    莫斯科—北京
    苏军红旗歌舞团团长  鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫
    苏联人民对和他们友好的中国人民的生活一向是十分关心的。中国人民的解放斗争总是引起苏联人民内心最热烈的共鸣。在中国近三十年来的解放斗争中，苏联人民把中国人民在争取自由和独立斗争的战线上的每一胜利、每一成就，都看做是自己的胜利而感到欢欣。苏联人民始终关心中国人民的生活，中国人民热爱自由的精神使我们非常感动，因此，我们苏军红旗歌舞团的团员自然非常高兴熟悉中国人民的艺术，了解他们的成就。
    我们在莫斯科非常有兴趣地看了中国的这些影片：“白毛女”，“解放了的中国”，“钢铁战士”，“中华女儿”，“无形的战线”。在莫斯科的剧院中上演着中国的戏剧：在瓦赫坦戈夫剧院上演着“白毛女”，在讽刺剧院上演着“西厢记”。
    我们读过了荣获斯大林三等奖金的周立波所著的“暴风骤雨”的俄译本。我们也熟悉中国伟大作家鲁迅作品的俄文译本。我们的儿童热爱中国的童话“刘家兄弟”。莫斯科电台并广播了根据这个童话改写的剧本。成千成万的莫斯科人参观了卓越的中国艺术展览会。中国的歌唱家、音乐家、舞蹈家和杂技团去年在苏联的巡回演出给予苏联观众以深刻的印象。我们也看到精巧无比的中国手工艺品。这些手工艺品陈列在莫斯科的东方文物馆和各国人民赠给进步人类的伟大领袖斯大林同志的礼品展览室。
    苏联艺术家创作的以中国为主题的巴蕾舞剧“红罂粟花”，二十五年来一直在苏联各歌舞剧院上演着。“红罂粟花”这一舞剧的音乐是苏联老一代的卓越作曲家格里艾尔所作。舞剧中女主角桃花姑娘的形象是不久以前访问过中国的巴蕾舞家乌兰诺娃艺术上巨大成就之一。
    莫斯科的民间歌舞团的节目中有中国的民间腰鼓舞。我们苏军红旗歌舞团在到中国来的很久以前，在演出的节目中就有“中国人民解放军进行曲”和莫拉特里作曲的“莫斯科——北京”。
    这样，我们虽然在苏联生活和工作着，却对中国已经有了许多印象，使我们能够初步认识中国人民的生活、中国人民争取解放的斗争、他们的艺术天才。当然，来到了中华人民共和国，我们的印象就更加无限地丰富起来。首先，我们一次又一次地感到中国人民对苏联人民及其伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志的深切的热爱。在中国各大城市中，我们受到友谊的欢迎，受到热烈的招待，这是中国人民对苏联人民，对苏联军队和斯大林同志的友谊和热爱的表示。在歌舞团的演出中，在群众大会上，在欢迎和欢送会上，我们深深感到中国人民对我们祖国人民的兄弟般的友谊，感到我们两大国人民间的团结的巨大力量。这种兴奋的心情鼓舞着我们热烈高兴地在中国劳动人民面前演出。
    中国演员、歌唱家、舞蹈家、音乐家和民间艺人为我们表演的技巧使我们得到极大的艺术享受。我们非常有兴趣地看了中国的古典戏剧，这些戏剧以艺术的形式体现出中国人民渴望自由和幸福生活的幻想。这些古代传说的歌剧中的那种动人的情感和英勇的形象引人入胜。歌剧主角为反对黑暗的恶势力、愚昧无知，为正义和劳动人民的幸福生活而斗争的遭遇是为我们所熟悉和了解的。
    在歌剧演出中，演员把歌唱、动作、道白和表情十分和谐地结合起来。演员栩栩如生的姿态、飘洒的步法、打动肺腑的歌唱、使人兴奋的演技，是每一出戏的特点。
    在演出节目中使我们最感兴趣的是歌唱家和器乐家所演奏的古代和现代的民间曲调。中国男女歌唱家宏亮和清脆的歌喉使我们的感情为之激荡。
    天赋的优美和灵活性，以及高度的技巧，是中国舞蹈家的艺术的特色。我们非常喜欢中国的民间腰鼓舞。在这种民间艺术所特有的朴实而美妙的舞蹈形式中，显示出人民摆脱了长期奴役桎梏的胜利者的雄伟步调。红旗歌舞团舞蹈队指挥，功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者巴维尔·维尔斯基拟在莫斯科完成他新的创作计划——创作以中苏友好为主题的舞，他正在搜集一切必要的材料。
    我们知道，在中国人民解放军中有很多文工团，这使我们特别愉快和兴奋。每一个这样的文工团都是我们刚满二十四岁的红旗歌舞团的亲弟弟。我衷心地祝贺我们的弟弟——中国人民解放军的部队文工团，在创作中有进一步的成就。让我们中国和一切新民主主义国家部队文工团的大家庭成长和巩固吧！红旗歌舞团是永远乐于用自己的创作经验来帮助我们各兄弟国家部队艺术发展的。
    在中国我们看到了富丽堂皇的古代建筑——北京的颐和园、故宫和天坛，南京的中山陵，杭州的许多名胜。我们看见了中国人民艺术天才的伟大力量。中国人民创建了这些杰出的建筑、木刻和石刻，在各种器皿上雕刻了美丽的、精巧无比的艺术图案，而这种器皿充满着中国的每个博物馆。
    回到莫斯科后，我们将立即组织一个展览会，陈列中国人民赠给我们的大量礼品，以便将中国人民的文化艺术介绍给苏联人民。红旗歌舞团将要在苏联演出中国人民的歌曲和舞蹈。我们相信我们歌舞团演出这些歌曲和舞蹈会受到热烈的欢迎，正像苏联的歌曲和舞蹈在中国人民中间受到热烈欢迎一样。
    最后，我代表红旗歌舞团全体人员衷心地感谢中国人民所给予我们的殷勤的招待；感谢跟我们在一起工作的，从中苏友好协会和部队来的中国同志们，因为他们很好地组织了我们的演出，在很大的程度上帮助了我们工作的成功。
    红旗歌舞团在中国一直是怀着极度愉快和高度创作兴奋的心情进行工作的。我们全体同志愿意贡献出自己的劳动来进一步巩固我们苏中两大国人民之间的友谊，巩固远东及世界和平。
    我们苏中两大国人民之间的永久的、牢不可破的友谊和强大的同盟万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    光荣属于全体进步人类的伟大领袖和导师、中国人民的最好的朋友约·维·斯大林大元帅！
