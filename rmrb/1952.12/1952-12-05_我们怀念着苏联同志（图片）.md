    We Cherish the Memory of Soviet Comrades

    19. Afterwards, the factory launched a major "Safety and Hygiene" inspection, a hot water boiler was installed in the factory, and safety guards were added to the machines. The old workers all said, "In the old society, we worked for decades, suffering from hunger and cold, with no one caring for us. Now the People's Government and Soviet friends care for us and look after us so well, our enthusiasm for production is even greater."

    21. One afternoon, just as the workers were getting off work, Comrade Darasov took out a letter and told me that he was being transferred back to his country. I was very surprised at the time, but I couldn't say anything. The workmates all gathered around Comrade Darasov, each filled with emotions of reluctance to part.

    二十一、一天下午，工人们刚下班，达拉索夫同志掏出一封信对我说他要奉调回国了。当时我很惊讶，但是嘴里也说不出什么来。工友们都围着达拉索夫同志，每个人充满了难舍难分的情绪。
