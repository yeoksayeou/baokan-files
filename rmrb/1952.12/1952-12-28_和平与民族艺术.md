    Peace and National Art
    Nakamura Kan'emon, Acting Head of the Japanese Delegation to the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference
    After attending the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in the great Chinese capital of Beijing, I also came into contact with the great Soviet art during Beijing's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month": dance, music, acrobatics... They were so beautiful, so fascinating and amazing.

    I also appreciated the Chinese Peking Opera, Yue Opera, the new opera "The White-Haired Girl," and folk dances, national music, and acrobatics, which were so beautiful that I couldn't help but admire them.

    Both Soviet and Chinese art give people a common feeling: national classical art has been preserved, improved, and thus produced new, lively descriptions of fresh things under careful care. That is, removing what is harmful to the people, carefully preserving what is beneficial to the people, and thereby producing new things with great content that endlessly serve the happiness of mankind.

    Chinese Peking Opera and Yue Opera are very similar to Japanese Kabuki. This time I saw the beautiful performance of "The Drunken Concubine" by Mr. Mei Lanfang, whom I hadn't seen for thirty-two or three years. My first contact with Mr. Mei's art was at the "Imperial Theater" in Tokyo, watching his "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers." That beautiful performance left a strong impression on my mind, which had just come of age, that could not be erased for a long time.

    Seeing that national theatrical art is being carefully cultivated, seeing that famous actors are cared for like national treasures, and seeing the energetic posture of people's artists developing forward, I naturally felt the great power of Chairman Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought's infinite love for art. My eyes couldn't help but fill with grateful tears.

    I heard that Mr. Mei Lanfang, in order to resist the Japanese militarists, refused to be forced to perform by violence, and finally grew a beard on the face of the female roles he played, always adhering to the ethics of art. I deeply realized that it was precisely because of that kind of spirit and action that he had such superb acting skills.

    I clearly saw that only in a liberated country that has achieved national independence can national art be continuously developed. The new opera "The White-Haired Girl" is full of vigor and freshness. From this play, we see the arduousness of the long-term struggle to overthrow the Japanese militarist aggressors and liberate the oppressed people. I realized that only from such actual struggles can there be the immense power to produce new creations for the people.

    Appreciating the Soviet national art, which has developed through the great thirty-five years of history and in beautiful refinement, with a magnificent spirit and full of new vitality, and the Chinese national art, which has been advancing at a rapid pace with youthful enthusiasm despite only three years since the founding of the country, has made me further realize that the great power of national liberation is the basis for the unlimited development of national art.

    Peace, only where there is genuine love for peace and striving for peace, can art grow.

    Seeing the art of the Soviet Union and China, I thought of my motherland, Japan. I feel that we Japanese artists must take the art of the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union as our hope and learning model, and create better people's art.

    Japanese Kabuki, which is similar to Chinese Peking Opera and Yue Opera, still has the excellent actor Nakamura Kichiemon alive, and the young actors have also made significant progress in their acting skills. However, the audience is limited to a fixed class, and they cannot get the opportunity to be appreciated, criticized, and improved by the general public. Not only that, but today's Japan, under the rule of American war-mongers and their servant Yoshida government, is reviving militarism. Aircraft invading Korea take off from Japan every day, and police reserve forces are being forced to go to the Korean battlefield as cannon fodder. If this situation continues for a long time, movies and dramas will once again be used as tools for propaganda for war, artists will fall into poverty, and no one can guarantee that they will not return to the tragic fate before the surrender. The current situation is already like this: the Grape Troupe, led by the famous Japanese new drama actress Yamamoto Yasue, staged Kinoshita Junji's political satire "Frog Ascends to Heaven." Although it was well received by the audience, the authorities issued an order, and the Mitsukoshi Theater refused to rent a venue for it to be staged. In the radio broadcast's "Sunday Entertainment Program," the famous actor Miki Toriro was considered "excessively satirical" and was restricted. At the same time, the progressive Central Chorus was also persecuted. The suppression of my troupe, the Progressive Troupe, is becoming more and more intense, as I reported at the Peace Conference. They even issued an order to arrest me on illegal pretexts to prevent us from performing for coal miners.

    However, the most progressive people's drama troupes in Japan have united. The Petrel Troupe, the Freedom Troupe, the Qianbingwei Troupe, the Tokyo Little Theater, and many other drama troupes have formed cultural work teams and are active in factories, rural areas, and cities, regardless of the persecution of the reactionary government. The Central Art Theater, the New Cooperative Troupe, the Actor Troupe, the Bunraku Troupe, Mingei, the Modern Actor Association and other new drama troupes are staging many progressive works. What is even more exciting is that workers, peasants, and intellectuals have widely organized cultural groups and are performing in factories, schools, and rural areas. They adopt folk songs or rewrite progressive lyrics in popular songs, which are loved by the masses. A large orchestra of six hundred people composed of workers from more than one hundred groups performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and their performance even surprised the musicians. With the support of peace-loving people, films have also been made with their own strength, such as: "No, We Want to Live!", "Mother, Woman", "Hakone Fuunroku", "Yamahiko School", "Children of the Atomic Bomb" and so on. Currently, the film "A Female Miner" depicting the life of miners has been funded by the Japanese Coal Miners' Union, starring the famous actress Yamada Isuzu, and is being filmed in Hokkaido. The work of filmmakers in making good films and the work of striving for peace have gradually been combined.

    These series of victorious advances showing the struggle of Japanese national art and colonial film and drama not only reflect the Japanese people's strength against war and for national independence, but also show that the Japanese working class has realized that they must rely on themselves to shoulder the task of the new culture. I firmly believe that this force will combine with the original Kabuki, new drama, new national drama and other aspects of strength, and do its best for Japan's peace, and further for the peace of the world. Now, more and more people feel that the effort to stop the war is to enable national art to survive and develop. Even some very conservative artists have signed against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," which reflects the strong will of people to defend art.

    When I was sent by the Japanese people to attend the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, the Progressive Troupe decided to stage Guo Moruo's masterpiece "Qu Yuan". Now, this play has been performed and has been praised immeasurably. Another group of the Progressive Troupe is staging Suzuki Masao's new work "Beauty Kangtaimei", which is a play with similar content and form to "The White-Haired Girl" and is a new attempt to fully promote national elements. What is even more gratifying is the recent merger of Japanese progressive drama troupes with the Progressive Troupe, which has strengthened their strength.

    Although I regret that I was unable to participate in the performances of "Qu Yuan" and "Beauty Kangtaimei", I had the opportunity to participate in the Beijing Peace Conference and understood that the Peace Conference is a great art. The true feelings and goodness of human nature revealed between people are the foundation of great art. I believe that standing on the stage of peace to serve the people, even if the achievements I make are very small, is also fighting to defend and develop national art.

    和平与民族艺术
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本代表团代理团长　中村翫右卫门
    在伟大的中国首都北京参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议以后，我又在北京的“中苏友好月”里接触了伟大的苏联的艺术：舞蹈、音乐、杂技……。它们是那样地美好，那样地令人神往而惊叹。
    我也欣赏了中国的京剧、越剧、新歌剧“白毛女”，和秧歌、民族音乐、杂技，美好得令人感佩不止。
    苏联艺术和中国艺术都使人有一种共同的感觉：民族的古典艺术，在十分细心的爱护下保存下来了，改进了，并且从而产生了新的、生动活泼地描写新鲜事物的东西。这就是去掉对人民有害的，而把对人民有利的细心地保存下来，并由此产生出成为无止境地为人类幸福服务的伟大内容的新东西。
    中国的京剧、越剧，是和日本的歌舞伎非常相似的。我这次又看到了睽违三十二、三年的梅兰芳先生的“贵妃醉酒”的优美演技。我最初接触梅先生的艺术是在东京“帝国剧场”看他的“天女散花”，那优美的演技，在我当时刚刚成年的脑中，就刻下了长久不能消失的强烈印象。
    看到了民族的戏剧艺术被郑重地培育着，看到了名演员如同国宝一样地被关怀着，看到了人民的艺术家充沛着青春活力向前发展的姿态，我就自然地感到了毛泽东主席文艺思想对艺术无限爱护的伟大力量。我的眼睛里不禁涌出了感激的热泪。
    我听到梅兰芳先生曾经为了反抗日本军国主义者，拒绝暴力强迫演剧，最后竟在自己饰演旦角的脸上留起胡髭来，始终坚守着艺术的道德。我深深地领会到，正因为有那样的精神和行动，所以才有这样的高超演技。
    我清楚地看到，只有在解放了的、获得了民族独立的国家中，民族的艺术才能获得不断的发展。新歌剧“白毛女”充满了魄力和新鲜的气息。从这个剧中，我们看到打倒日本军国主义侵略者、解放被压迫人民的长期斗争的艰苦。我认识到只有从这样的实际斗争中，才能有产生人民的新创作的那种雄厚力量。
    欣赏了经过伟大的三十五年的历史、在优美的洗练中发展着的、气魄雄伟充满新生命力的苏联民族艺术，和建国虽仅三年而充沛着年青热情以急速步调前进着的中国民族艺术，使我更进一步认识了民族解放的伟大力量是民族艺术无限发展的基础。
    和平，真正爱好和平、争取和平的地方，艺术才能生长。
    看到苏联和中国的艺术，我联想到我的祖国日本。我感到我们日本艺术工作者必须以中苏两大国的艺术作为我们希望的寄托和学习的榜样，创造更好的人民艺术。
    和中国的京剧、越剧相似的日本歌舞伎，虽然演技优良的名演员中村吉右卫门仍然健在，年青的演员们演技也有显著的进步，然而观众只限于固定的阶层，不能得到国民大众的欣赏、批评和改进的机会。不但如此，今天的日本，在美国战争贩子及其奴仆吉田政府的统治下，正在复活军国主义。侵略朝鲜的飞机每天每天从日本起飞，警察后备队正在被逼迫着送往朝鲜战场充当炮灰。这种情况如果长此继续下去，电影、戏剧都将再度被作为宣传战争的工具，艺术家将陷入贫苦的境地，谁也不能保证不回复到投降前那种悲惨的厄运中。现在的情况已经是这样：日本新剧著名女演员山本安英所主持的葡萄剧社上演了木下顺二的政治讽刺剧“蛙升天”，虽然获得观众好评，但当局下了指令，三越剧院拒绝租场址给它上演了。无线电广播的“星期日娱乐节目”中，著名的演员三木鸡郎被认为“讽刺过度”而受到了限制，同时进步的中央合唱团也受到了迫害。对我所在的前进剧团的镇压，如同我在和平会议中所报告的，正日趋剧烈。甚至用非法藉口发出逮捕我的命令，阻止我们对煤矿工人演出。
    但是，日本最进步的人民戏剧团体已经团结起来了。海燕剧团、自由剧团、钱兵卫剧团东京小剧场等等许多戏剧团体，都已组成文化工作队，不顾反动政府的迫害，活跃在工厂、农村和城市中。中央艺术剧场、新协剧团、演员剧团、文乐剧团、民艺、现代演员协会等新剧的团体，在上演着很多的进步作品。更使人兴奋的是工人、农民和知识分子都广泛地组织了文化小组，在工厂、学校、农村中演出。他们采用民间歌曲或把流行歌曲中改填进步的歌词，获得了群众的热爱。由一百几十个团体中的工人组成的一个六百人的大音乐团，演奏了贝多芬的第九交响曲，他们的演出甚至连音乐家们也吃惊了。电影也在爱好和平人们的支持下用自己的力量摄制成了几部好片子，如：“不，我们要活下去！”、“母亲，女人”、“箱根风云录”、“山彦学校”、“原子弹下的孤儿”等等。目前，描写矿工生活的电影“一个女矿工”已经由日本煤矿工会出资摄制，由名演员山田五十铃主演，在北海道开始拍摄。电影工作者摄制好电影的工作和争取和平的工作，已渐渐地结合在一起进行了。
    这些显示着日本民族艺术和殖民地电影戏剧斗争的一系列的胜利前进的事实，不仅反映出日本人民反对战争、争取民族独立的力量，同时也说明了日本工人阶级已经觉悟到必须依靠自己来担负起新文化的任务。我深信这股力量将会与原有的歌舞伎，新剧、新国剧等各方面的力量结合起来，为日本的和平，进而为全世界的和平尽力。现在，愈来愈多的人已经感到，为制止战争所作的努力，就是为了使民族艺术获得生存与发展。甚至一些很保守的艺人也已经签名反对“防止破坏活动法案”，这反映了人们保卫艺术意志的强烈。
    当我被日本人民派来参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的时候，前进剧团决定上演郭沫若先生的杰作“屈原”。现在，这个剧已经演出，并获得了无比的好评。前进剧团的另一组正在上演铃木政男的新作“美女康太妹”，这是内容和形式都和“白毛女”相似的一个剧，是充分发扬民族因素的新尝试。更可欣慰的是日本的进步戏剧团体最近与前进剧团的汇合，这使它们的力量更加强了。
    我虽然因为没有能够参加“屈原”和“美女康太妹”的演出而感到遗憾，但我却得到机会参加了北京的和平会议，并且理解到和平会议就是伟大的艺术。人与人之间流露的真情和善良的本性是伟大艺术的基础。我相信，站在和平舞台上为人民服务，即便我做出的成绩很微小，也同样就是为保卫和发展民族艺术而斗争。
