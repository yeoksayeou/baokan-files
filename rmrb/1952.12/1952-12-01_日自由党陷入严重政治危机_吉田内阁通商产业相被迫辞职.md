    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th—Tokyo News: The Japanese Diet's House of Representatives passed a vote of no confidence against Minister of International Trade and Industry Hayato Ikeda on the 28th. The Yoshida Cabinet, which was widely believed to have a short lifespan from the start, has shown signs of instability under the influence of popular opposition and growing internal contradictions within the reactionary groups.
    Hayato Ikeda, who won the appreciation of the United States for faithfully implementing the "Dodge Plan," has recently insisted on implementing policies under the name of "currency stabilization" that enrich monopoly capital and crack down on small and medium-sized enterprises. On the 27th, Ikeda brazenly stated in response to inquiries in the House of Representatives that the government "cannot care about" the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises "at the current stage of the Japanese economy." On the 28th, the opposition party in the House of Representatives proposed a vote of no confidence against Ikeda at the meeting. The Liberal Party, which held only a slight majority in the House of Representatives, ordered Liberal Party members not to be absent in advance in an attempt to prevent the passage of the vote of no confidence. However, all members of the Hatoyama faction within the Liberal Party deliberately did not attend, causing the motion to pass with a difference of seven votes, 208 to 201.
    Kyodo News Agency said: The passage of the vote of no confidence against Ikeda has plunged the Yoshida Liberal Party into a serious political crisis. Ikeda was forced to resign as Minister of International Trade and Industry after the vote of no confidence was passed by the House of Representatives. His vacant post is temporarily held by Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Mikujiro Ogasawara.

    日自由党陷入严重政治危机
    吉田内阁通商产业相被迫辞职
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本国会众议院二十八日会议通过了对通商产业相池田勇人的不信任案。一上台就被普遍认为寿命不长的吉田内阁，在人民的反对和反动集团内部矛盾增长的影响下，已露出不稳的端倪。
    以忠实执行“道奇方案”而博得美国赏识的池田勇人，最近在“稳定通货”的名义下，坚持实行养肥垄断资本、打击中小企业的政策。二十七日，池田在众议院答复质询时竟放肆地说：中小企业“在日本经济的目前阶段中破产，政府是顾不得这些的”。二十八日，众院反对党在会议上提出对池田的不信任案。在众院仅占微弱多数的自由党，虽在事前命令自由党议员不得缺席，以图阻止不信任案的通过，但自由党内鸠山派议员全体故意不出席，使该案终以二百零八票对二百零一票的七票之差获得通过。
    共同社说：对池田的不信任案的通过已使吉田自由党陷入严重的政治危机。池田在众院通过不信任案后已被迫辞去通商产业相，遗职由农林相小笠原三九郎暂兼。
