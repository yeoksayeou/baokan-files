	Judicial Personnel Chen Xianzhang of the Ling County People's Court Actually Defends the Feudal Marriage System

	Editor: Tan Duanxiu, a woman from the First District of Ling County, Hunan Province, was betrothed to Wang Yunwen by her parents in childhood. After the marriage, there was no affection between the couple. Tan Duanxiu suffered greatly mentally but dared not file for divorce. After liberation, her awareness gradually increased, and she eagerly sought to free herself from the shackles of the feudal marriage system. When she filed a request with the Ling County People's Court to divorce Wang Yunwen, Chen Xianzhang (an old judicial officer), who was handling the case, actually believed that Tan Duanxiu was not "virtuous" and "damaged social morality," fearing that "freedom of marriage" would lead to "universal chaos." In order to "punish one as a warning to a hundred," Chen illegally detained Tan Duanxiu for forty-seven days. He also detained Tan Duanxiu's mother for several days on the "charge" of "failing to educate her daughter." Finally, he forced Tan Duanxiu's mother to acknowledge in writing that "she had failed to educate her daughter," which led to her daughter engaging in "corrupt" behavior with other men, violating "ethical principles." As a result, of course, Tan Duanxiu was still not granted a divorce.

	I believe that Tan Duanxiu's act of resisting the reactionary "three obediences and four virtues" and "family education" and striving for freedom of marriage is completely just and legal. Chen Xianzhang's behavior of defending the feudal marriage system and infringing upon human rights is absolutely intolerable. I hope that Chen Xianzhang will strictly examine his old legal views and old judicial style in this judicial reform movement, thoroughly reform himself, and publicly apologize to Tan Duanxiu and her mother to recover the political losses suffered by the Party and the People's Government.

    酃县人民法院司法人员陈咸章竟维护封建婚姻制度
    编辑同志：湖南酃县一区妇女谭端秀幼时即由父母包办和王云文结婚。婚后，夫妻毫无感情。谭端秀精神上极为痛苦，但又不敢提出离婚。解放后，她的觉悟逐渐提高，迫切要求从封建婚姻枷锁下解放出来。她向酃县人民法院提出和王云文离婚的要求时，该院承办人陈咸章（旧司法人员）竟认为谭端秀不守“妇道”、“伤害了社会风化”，深怕“婚姻自由”会“天下大乱”。陈为了“惩一儆百”，非法把谭端秀扣押了四十七天；还以“没有对女儿进行家教”的“罪”名，把谭端秀的母亲也扣押了几天。最后要谭端秀的母亲具结承认：“自己对女儿没有进行家教”，以致女儿和别的男人发生“腐化”行为，违反了“礼教”。结果，当然谭端秀还是没有被判决离婚。
    我认为谭端秀反抗反动的“三从四德”、“家教”而争取婚姻自由的行为，完全是正义的、合法的。陈咸章的维护封建婚姻制度、侵犯人权的行为是令人绝对不能容忍的。我希望陈咸章在这次司法改革运动中，严格地检查旧法观点、旧司法作风，痛切改造，并向谭端秀母女公开道歉，以挽回党和人民政府在政治上所受到的损失。张嵩伯
