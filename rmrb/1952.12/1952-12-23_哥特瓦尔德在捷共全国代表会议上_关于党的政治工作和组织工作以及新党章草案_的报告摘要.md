Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 19th (TASS): The Czechoslovak News Agency reported that Klement Gottwald delivered a report on "The Party's Political and Organizational Work and the Draft New Party Constitution" at the Czechoslovak Communist Party National Conference on December 16th.

Gottwald said: This Party National Conference is being held in an atmosphere of close concern from our friends and mad attacks from our enemies. This reminds us of the February events and some comments after the February events. At that time, our foreign enemies all started barking as if under an order, and they did not rest for a long time. To be honest, they have not calmed down to this day. Now they are regaining their energy, maliciously raging against our republic and our party.

Why are all kinds of imperialists and reactionaries, these bigwigs, so resentful of us? This is because we have uncovered and crushed the anti-national conspiracy center headed by their running dog, Slánský. In other words, the enemy shouted because they were caught off guard. They shouted in 1948 when we crushed one of their spy agencies after the February events. They also shouted in November 1952 when we crushed their second spy agency.

Gottwald pointed out that the results of World War II proved that Hitler and the Anglo-American imperialists were completely wrong, because the war ended with the defeat of Hitlerism and the victory of the Soviet army. The victory of the Soviet army brought freedom to the people of many countries, enabling them to settle accounts with their former bigwigs. Gottwald continued, these people who got rid of domestic and foreign exploiters, eagerly hoped to build a new society of peace and tranquility, but the imperialists were unwilling to respect the free expression of these people's will. The imperialists tried to obstruct their construction in every possible and impossible way, to damage them, and finally put shackles on them again. The sabotage work carried out in the people's democratic countries is an integral part of the US imperialist war preparations. The big American tycoons openly passed a bill with an extremely shameless hooligan attitude to allocate 100 million US dollars for this purpose, not to mention the hundreds of millions of dollars they secretly used for this kind of dirty work. Establishing a "fifth column" within the people's democratic countries has become an officially recognized policy of the United States. The anti-national conspiracy center of Slánský and his gang was this "fifth column" of the United States in Czechoslovakia. Gottwald pointed out that now, the anti-national conspiracy center has been crushed. But things are not over yet. We still have two things to do: first, to draw appropriate conclusions for now and for the future; second, we must tenaciously make up for the huge losses caused by the American "fifth column".

Gottwald said that because we have uncovered and crushed the anti-national conspiracy center, our enemies are clamoring that the Czechoslovak Communist Party has been weakened, and even say that it has collapsed. But these bigwigs themselves do not believe their own words. Is it true that we were more powerful when traitors and alien spies were lurking among us, when the American "fifth column" was active in our ranks? Common sense tells us that this is definitely not the case. When we cut off the head of the American "fifth column," we will definitely become stronger. Does the fact that the Party and its leading organs resolutely cleaned out the traitors without favoritism prove how firmly we are loyal to the cause of the working class, to the cause of the people, to the cause of the nation, and to the cause of socialism? We had warned long ago that no traitor could stand on our land, and that each of them would sooner or later be punished as they deserved. Hasn't the significance of our warning been proved by facts? I think the facts have proved this point.

Gottwald then spoke about some issues in Czechoslovakia's economic construction, saying that the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan is about to end, so it is beneficial to review the road we have traveled during this period. As everyone knows, the anti-national conspirators did cause very great losses to our economy. However, they have not been able to stop the development of our national economy. Many facts and figures can prove this. For example, in the four years of the Five-Year Plan, that is, in the four years from 1949 to 1952, the total output of all industries increased by 82%, almost doubling the pre-war level of 1937, that is, exceeding the pre-war level by 97%. In the four years of the Five-Year Plan, the total output of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry increased by 108%, the total output of enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry increased by 50%, and the total output of enterprises under the Ministry of Food Industry increased by 69%. In recent four years, the output increased by an average of 16% per year. The industrial production in Slovakia has developed particularly significantly. In Slovakia, the total industrial output this year will exceed the pre-war level by 3.25 times, and exceed the production level at the beginning of the Five-Year Plan by one time. Some products in the country will reach or exceed the tasks stipulated by the Five-Year Plan to be completed at the end of the Five-Year Plan this year. For example, lignite, electricity, steel, iron ore, caustic soda, rayon, linen fabrics, artificial fats, etc. However, another most important and most important thing is: we will almost not be able to complete the plans for any major raw materials stipulated in the expanded Five-Year Plan. However, in fact, the total industrial output of our country in 1952 will exceed the industrial production level of 1937 before the war by 97%. What are the reasons for the difficulties we have encountered in this regard? The reason is: first, our demand is growing faster than production, including the needs of the industry itself and the needs of the residents. In the republic before the Munich incident, the industry developed very slowly, either periodic crises or stagnation. In the people's democratic Czechoslovakia, the industry is constantly growing. Everyone knows that the purchasing power of our urban and rural residents has greatly increased. In the republic era before the Munich incident, there were more than 900,000 unemployed people during the crisis, and hundreds of thousands of semi-unemployed people. Therefore, the living standards of the entire working class plummeted at that time. The current situation is completely different, we have no unemployed or semi-unemployed people. With the increase in purchasing power, the demand is constantly increasing, and our current production cannot fully meet this demand in all aspects. Another reason for the difficulties in our industry is that the development between individual industrial sectors, mainly raw materials, power base and processing industry sectors, is very unbalanced. In this regard, the conspirators caused particularly huge losses, and it will take a lot of time to overcome the consequences of the losses they caused. The reason why we are suffering difficulties now also lies in the imbalance in the development within individual industrial sectors. What hinders the relatively rapid and coordinated development of our industry is not only the lack of coordination between factories in various departments, but also the lack of coordination between factories belonging to the same department. There are still many potentials in our industry that have not been used. If we want to find a common point in most of the shortcomings of our industry (and not only industry), then I think it is: from top to bottom, ignoring national discipline and labor discipline. Therefore, I think that consolidating national discipline and labor discipline from top to bottom is the most important task of our party.

Speaking of agriculture, Gottwald said that our agriculture is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Agriculture is transitioning from individual economy to collective economy. The number of unified agricultural cooperatives has increased this year. As of October 30, 1952, there were 8,636 unified agricultural cooperatives. There are 6,880 unified agricultural cooperatives that have cancelled field boundaries, accounting for about 48% of the total number of villages. Compared with 1948, the output of wheat, barley, oil crops, sugar beets, potatoes, flax, and hemp increased this year, while the feed crops remained at the original level. The output of oats, hops and fresh grass has decreased instead. As for animal husbandry, the number of livestock and poultry (excluding chickens) this year has increased compared to 1948. The number of edible cattle increased by 24%. The number of cows increased by 20%, the number of edible pigs increased by 74%, the number of sows increased by 42%, the number of sheep increased by 13%, and the number of chickens decreased by 5%. Compared with 1937 before the war, the number of edible pigs, sows and sheep increased this year. The number of edible cattle, cows and chickens decreased. Compared with 1948, the output of meat, milk, eggs, etc. increased this year. For example, the amount of cattle slaughtered increased by 36%, the amount of sheep slaughtered increased by 53%, the amount of pigs slaughtered increased by 107%, the amount of milk increased by 41%, and the amount of eggs increased by 57%. Compared with 1937 before the war, the output of meat and the number of edible cattle and edible pigs increased this year, the number of edible sheep did not increase or decrease, and the output of milk and eggs decreased. This year's agricultural product procurement plan greatly exceeded the procurement plan of 1948. This year's grain procurement plan (i.e., grain and feed crops) can be completed, as well as the hay and straw plan. However, the procurement plans for beans, oil crops, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits, vegetables and hops will not be completed. In terms of animal products, this year's edible cattle plan can be basically completed, but the procurement plans for milk and eggs will not be completed. The proportion of socialist components in agricultural product procurement has increased, reaching this year: 27% in the procurement of cereal crops, 52% in the procurement of oil crops, 11% in the procurement of potatoes, 30% in the procurement of edible cattle and edible sheep, about 47% in the procurement of pigs, and about 18% in the procurement of poultry. From the materials listed above, it can be seen that in the past four years, we have made certain progress in agricultural production, especially in the number of agricultural livestock. But it can also be clearly seen that the current level of agricultural production is not enough. Our agricultural land area is limited. And more importantly, do not waste any agricultural land. Our unified agricultural cooperatives will play an increasingly important role in increasing the harvest per hectare and the rate of animal husbandry. In order to achieve this goal, and also to make our rural areas transition to the socialist road in the future, the Party and the government should pay special attention to these unified agricultural cooperatives. Now the agricultural cooperatives and the entire rural area are discussing the draft charter of agricultural cooperatives and preparing for the National Congress of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives, which will adopt this charter. The foundation of the increasingly expanded agricultural production cooperation and the general task of agricultural production—that is, to increase the harvest per hectare and increase the rate of animal husbandry—have increasingly sharply raised and will continue to raise the issue of mechanization of agricultural work. The work of our machine tractor stations has improved slightly this year. Generally speaking, it should be said that the mechanization of our agricultural work is still low. The existing tractors in machine tractor stations and state farms have not been fully utilized. In the Soviet Union, machine tractor stations do 170 kinds of field work, while our machine tractor stations can only do 48 kinds of field work, which shows how backward we are in the mechanization of agricultural work. Our current task is to develop the creativity of scientific workers and practical workers in many ways, and to ensure that our socialist agriculture is built on a scientific basis.

Speaking of procurement issues, Gottwald pointed out that a new agricultural product procurement system will be implemented nationwide from 1953. The new procurement system will help consolidate the alliance between the working class and the middle and small peasants, and will promote the further development of unified agricultural cooperatives. Eliminating the existing egalitarianism in determining the allocation will more effectively restrict and exclude rich peasants, which is an important factor in developing the entire agricultural production. Gottwald also said that caring for people and caring for improving their living conditions is the main purpose of all efforts under the socialist system. Stalin has pointed out in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that if the basic economic law of capitalism is "to ensure the maximum capitalist profit by exploiting the majority of the residents of their own country and making them bankrupt and impoverished, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the backward countries, and by means of wars and the militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring the highest profits." Then the basic economic law of socialism is "to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on a high technical basis." This short, Stalin-discovered law contains the entire direction and goal, as well as the path to achieve this goal. This Stalin's law also conforms to the actual situation of our republic—the people's democratic republic that is building socialism. No one can deny that our people's democratic system has improved the material and cultural conditions of the vast majority of residents. The laboring peasants have obtained land from the landlords and churches, they have been guaranteed to sell their products at appropriate prices, they have the opportunity to unite in more advanced forms of economy and production, and through this form they have obtained the state's strong help to improve their labor productivity, and also improve their material well-being. Workers, staff, and intellectuals have all escaped the doom of unemployment or semi-unemployment, everyone can get a job, can increase products and increase their wages. Our children have received unprecedented care, they have a truly happy childhood, a childhood that we adults could not have imagined before, and a broad road has been opened up in front of them, leading to education, labor, happiness, and a happy life.

The government cares for the elderly and the incapacitated citizens. Expenditures on sickness fees, pension insurance fees, and child allowances increased from 5.3 billion crowns (Czech currency) in 1937 to 53.9 billion crowns in 1952. The population increase rate in 1937 was only 0.37%, while in 1951 it was 1.13%. Expenditures on various free measures for residents, such as education fees, health care fees, various social insurance fees, and paid leave, increased from 5.8 billion crowns in 1937 to 81.2 billion crowns in 1952. These free measures accounted for 17% of the average wage in 1937, and increased to 42% in 1952. As for the supply of food and essential industrial products to residents, we are not satisfied, because the number of people who can afford these things has increased. In general, our consumption of food and industrial products has increased compared to before the war. But in this regard, the pre-war level is not enough for us.

Next, Gottwald analyzed the reasons for the shortcomings in the supply. Here, to be honest, the current agricultural production—the production of cultivation and animal husbandry, and the procurement situation—cannot meet the demand proposed by purchasing power. The policy of our party and government will continue to strive to meet the constantly increasing material and cultural needs of the residents, but here no one should forget that I said in the report on the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Stalin's basic economic law of socialism is composed of three inseparable parts, and it should not be forgotten that to achieve the first part, that is, "to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society," one must complete the second and third parts, that is, to continuously increase and continuously improve socialist production on a high technical basis. I think that this is the only correct way for us to truly lead our people to a prosperous life.

Now I will talk about several issues about the Party and talk about the draft new Party Constitution.

It is necessary to constantly remind all party members, especially young party members: Comrades, the Party is everything! The Party, and only the Party, is the guarantee of the liberation of our people. The Party, and only the Party, is the guarantee that those bigwigs can never be restored. The Party, and only the Party, can guarantee that we will build a happy socialist future for the people we have united. (Stormy and lasting applause)

In order to destroy the masses' trust in the Party and destroy the party members' trust in the leadership, the conspirators have spent a lot of effort, but they have not succeeded. The masses' trust in the Party has been re-raised, especially because the masses have seen that the Party can clean out the alien and hostile dregs from the Party's ranks, because the Party is serious and especially intolerant of those who were previously placed in leading positions by the Party, but now have betrayed the Party's trust and become traitors. Since cleaning out the traitors in leading positions, the Party's political, organizational and ideological work has become more active.

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a major event in our Party's life. We personally participated in this Congress of the Party, the Party of Lenin-Stalin, which has been carrying out a world-historically significant cause from the past to the present. We saw with our own eyes how this elected Party headquarters discussed major issues in the Stalinist manner, how it evaluated its own cause in a critical and self-critical manner and put forward new and heroic tasks for itself. This Congress itself taught us a lot. The Soviet comrades' methods and ways of handling things, their clarity and confidence in solving the problems raised, and their specific means of ensuring the completion of tasks and achieving goals, in short, the entire work style of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is particularly worthy of our study. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union caused special attention in our entire society, especially in our Party. Everyone not only reads the documents of the Congress published in newspapers, pamphlets and books, but also studies them. In the Party's education network, a school year will be used to study the materials and documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," which was studied before the Congress. It has been said more than once that learning should not be empty and academic, the main thing is that after we study these materials, we can draw some conclusions that are suitable for our conditions in order to apply them to our practical work. The draft new Party Constitution of the Czechoslovak Communist Party submitted to this National Congress is an attempt to creatively apply the summary of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to our environment based on our own experience and our own requirements. The Party Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed by the 19th Party Congress embodies the rich experience that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has gained over the decades in construction, in Party work, in leading the country and the country's political, economic and cultural construction, in leading the Great Patriotic War, in the work of the post-victory period, and in the gradual transition to communism.

Gottwald said that as everyone knows, the draft of our Party's new Party Constitution has undergone extensive discussions in Party organizations at all levels and in Party newspapers. Gottwald then explained the main provisions of the draft new Party Constitution and said that I am convinced that this draft and the supplements after the internal Party discussion will be passed at the National Congress as the new Party law. He said that the main thing at present is to apply the new Party Constitution in practice and raise the Party's work and Party members to the level required by the new Party Constitution. I believe that the new Party Constitution will politically, organizationally and ideologically arm the entire Party to carry out new struggles and new work in building socialism (stormy and lasting applause).

A few days ago, the Presidium of the Party and the government approved the economic plan for 1953, the last year of the Five-Year Plan. Gottwald said that I would like to make some comments on this. The economic plan for 1953, which was formulated based on the tasks that will be completed in 1952, is quite high. The plan stipulates that the total industrial output will increase by 18.4%, the total investment in various sectors of the national economy will increase by 18%, the industrial labor productivity will increase by 15.1%, the construction industry labor productivity will increase by 12.2%, the industrial cost will be reduced by 5.9%, the retail trade volume of state-owned and cooperative societies will increase by 3.2%, and so on. Gottwald pointed out that according to the economic plan for 1953, many measures will be taken to reduce the imbalance in the economy and eliminate many of the shortcomings caused by conspirators and saboteurs in our economy. We should do our best to make up for the losses they have caused in the shortest possible time. At the same time, we should realize that we will not be able to fully do this next year. The tasks of our economic plan for 1953 are very arduous, and we must use all our strength and concentrate the wisdom of the entire Party and the entire people to complete the plan. If we pay attention to the following points, the plan can be completed and must be completed:

First, the entire Party should raise the ideological, political and organizational activeness of all party members and party organizations at all levels in the spirit of the new Party Constitution. In addition, party organizations at all levels and every party member should greatly increase the role of representing the masses and leading the masses within the scope of their activities;

Second, we must greatly improve the political level and specialized knowledge of our economic leading agencies from top to bottom, and improve them to the level required by the tasks that are about to come. I can say with certainty that the issue of the quality of our economic leadership is one of the most important issues;

Third, we should more boldly promote new young cadres to leading positions in our economy, pay better attention to their political and technical education, and at the same time, in production and in the education of new cadres, we should also use those old technical intellectuals and scientific workers who agree with the current people's democratic system and support the Soviet Union;

Fourth, we must strictly implement the requirements of national discipline and labor discipline. We can no longer allow those responsible persons to destroy the decisions of the Party and the state and get away with it, nor can we allow the situation of not completing tasks casually;

Fifth, we must guarantee to plan the inspection of the implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government by all means, and we must make every communist not think this is a grievance, on the contrary, they should welcome this inspection and automatically request to regularly inspect their work and activities;

Sixth, we should ensure that we eliminate the situation of not taking practical measures to eliminate the discovered shortcomings and errors immediately after they are discovered;

Seventh, we must learn to better and more than now encourage and organize everyone's creative spirit, socialist competition and innovation movement, and improve the technical level of all the vast number of staff to the level of advanced staff;

Eighth, we must consistently devote ourselves and achieve in all places and in every aspect of our economic and social life to practicing thrift, reducing costs, and improving labor productivity;

Ninth, we should not forget that the ultimate goal of all our efforts is people, and it is caring for people's welfare. Therefore, it is necessary to supply our residents with necessities and consumer goods within the scope of our industrial and agricultural production possibilities, so that their total amount and purchasing power and demand are fully adapted;

Tenth, we should not forget the imperialist warmongers, we must continue to fight for peace, and we must protect the security of the republic and guarantee the national defense forces.

These are our main tasks at present. Comrades, I think that with the support of our millions of party members, with the support of millions of non-party masses, and with the support of the entire national united front, we will definitely be able to complete these tasks. We can complete these tasks also because we have the help of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin himself (stormy and lasting applause, the entire audience stood up and rhythmically shouted: "Stalin—Gottwald—Peace!" followed by another round of applause, turning into cheers, cheering the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, cheering the great leader of the working people, Stalin, cheering the Czechoslovak Communist Party and its beloved chairman Klement Gottwald).

    哥特瓦尔德在捷共全国代表会议上“关于党的政治工作和组织工作以及新党章草案”的报告摘要
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格十九日电：捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：克利门特·哥特瓦尔德于十二月十六日在捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议上作了“关于党的政治工作和组织工作以及新党章草案”的报告。
    哥特瓦尔德说：这次党的全国代表会议是在我们的朋友密切关怀和我们的敌人疯狂攻讦的气氛中举行的。这使我们想起了二月事件和二月事件以后的一些评论。当时我们的国外的敌人好像在一道命令之下似的都开始狂吠，长久没有安息下来。老实说，他们一直到现在还没有安静下来。现在他们又重新鼓起劲头，满怀恶意地在向我们共和国和我们党暴跳如雷。
    为什么形形色色的帝国主义者和反动分子这些大人先生们这样愤恨我们呢？这是因为我们破获了、粉碎了以他们的走狗斯兰斯基为首的反国家阴谋中心。换句话说，敌人叫嚣了起来是因为他们被出其不意地抓住了。一九四八年二月当我们粉碎了他们特务机关之一以后，他们曾经叫嚣过。一九五二年十一月当我们粉碎了他们的第二个特务机关以后，他们也曾经叫嚣过。
    哥特瓦尔德指出，第二次世界大战的结果证明，希特勒和美英帝国主义者是完全失算了，因为这个战争以希特勒主义的失败和苏联军队的胜利告终，苏军的胜利给许多国家的人民带来了自由，使他们有可能清算他们从前的大人先生们。哥特瓦尔德接着说，这些摆脱了国内外剥削者的人民，热切地希望建设和平安静的新社会秩序，但是帝国主义者不愿尊重这些人民自由表现的意志，帝国主义者用一切可能和不可能的方法，想来阻碍他们的这种建设，给他们以损害，最后重新给他们套上枷锁。在人民民主国家进行的破坏工作是美帝国主义战争准备的组成部分。美国的大财主以极其无耻的流氓态度公然通过关于以一亿美元用于这个目的的法案，至于他们偷偷用于干这种勾当的成亿成亿的美元还不算在内。在人民民主国家内部建立“第五纵队”已是美国正式承认的政策了。斯兰斯基及其党羽的反国家阴谋中心就是美国在捷克斯洛伐克的这种
    “第五纵队”。哥特瓦尔德指出，现在，反国家阴谋中心被粉碎了。但是事情并不从此就完了。我们还要做两件事：第一，为现在和将来作出适当的结论；第二，我们要顽强地弥补美国“第五纵队”所造成的巨大的损失。
    哥特瓦尔德说，由于我们破获并粉碎了反国家阴谋中心，我们的敌人便叫嚣什么捷克斯洛伐克共产党已经削弱、甚至说它已经瓦解了。但是这些大人先生们自己也不相信自己的话。难道说当卖国贼和异己的特务潜伏在我们中间的时候，当美国“第五纵队”在我们的队伍中活动的时候，我们更强有力吗？常识告诉我们，决不是这样。当我们把美国“第五纵队”的头砍掉以后，我们一定会更加强大有力的。党和它的领导机关不徇情面，毅然把叛徒清洗掉，这个事实难道不是证明我们是如何坚定地忠于工人阶级的事业、忠于人民的事业、忠于民族的事业、忠于社会主义的事业吗？我们早就警告过，在我们的国土上没有一个叛徒能站住脚，他们每一个人迟早总要遭到应有的惩罚，难道事实没有证明我们警告的重大意义吗？我认为，事实已证明了这一点。
    哥特瓦尔德继就捷克斯洛伐克的经济建设中的一些问题说道，五年计划的第四年就要结束了，因此检查一下我们这段时期所走过的道路，是有益的。大家知道，反国家阴谋分子的确给我们的经济造成非常大的损失。不过他们并没有能够阻止住我们国民经济的发展。许多事实和数字都可以证明这一点。例如，五年计划的四年中，即在一九四九年到一九五二年这四年中，全部工业的总产量提高了百分之八十二，差不多超过战前一九三七年水平的一倍，即超过战前水平百分之九十七。五年计划的四年中，重工业部各企业的总生产量提高了百分之一百零八，轻工业部各企业的总生产量提高了百分之五十，食品工业部各企业的总生产量提高了百分之六十九。最近四年生产量平均每年提高百分之十六。斯洛伐克的工业生产发展特别显著。在斯洛伐克，今年工业总生产量将超过战前水平三点二五倍，超过五年计划初期生产水平一倍。今年全国有些产品即将达到或超过五年计划规定的在五年计划终了时应完成的任务。例如，褐煤、电力、钢、铁矿、苛性苏打、人造纤维、亚麻织品、人造脂肪等。但是，另一件最主要的和最重要的事是：扩大了的五年计划所规定的任何一种主要原料的计划，我们差不多都将不能完成。不过，事实上，我们一九五二年工业的总生产量将超过战前一九三七年的工业生产水平百分之九十七。我们在这方面所碰到的困难的原因在哪里呢？原因是：第一，我们的需求增长得比生产快，其中包括工业本身的需求和居民的需要。在慕尼黑事件以前的共和国，工业发展得很慢，不是周期性的危机，就是停滞。在人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克，工业不断增长。每一个人都知道，我们城乡居民的购买力已经大大提高了。慕尼黑事件以前的共和国时代，发生危机时，就有九十多万失业的人，半失业的人达到数十万。因此，当时整个工人阶级的生活水平急剧下降。现在的情况已完全不一样了，我们没有失业或半失业的人。随着购买力的提高，需求不断增加，目前我们的生产还无法在各方面完全满足这种需求。我们工业方面发生困难的另一个原因是，个别工业部门，主要是原料、动力基础和加工工业部门之间的发展十分不平衡。在这方面主要是由于阴谋分子造成了特别巨大的损失，要克服他们所造成损失的后果，还得不少的时间。我们现在遭受困难的原因同时还在于个别工业部门内部发展的不平衡。阻碍我们工业比较迅速地、协调地发展的不仅由于各部的工厂之间工作配合得不够，而且还由于属于同一个部的工厂之间工作配合得不够。在我们的工业中还有许多潜力没有使用。如果我们要在我们工业（而且不仅工业）的大部分缺点中找出共同之点的话，那么我认为，这就是：自上而下的忽视国家纪律和劳动纪律。因之，我认为自上而下地巩固国家纪律和劳动纪律是我们党的最主要的任务。
    谈到农业方面，哥特瓦尔德说，我们的农业正在实行根本的改造。农业正在从个体经济过渡到集体经济。统一农业合作社的数目今年增加了。到一九五二年十月三十日为止已有八千六百三十六个统一农业合作社。已取消田界的统一农业合作社有六千八百八十个，约占整个村庄数目的百分之四十八。和一九四八年比较，今年小麦、大麦、含油作物、甜菜、马铃薯、亚麻、大麻的产量增加了，而饲料作物则仍停留在原来的水平上。燕麦、蛇麻草和鲜草的产量则反而降低了。至于畜产，今年农业牲畜和家禽（鸡除外）的头数比一九四八年增加了。食用牛的头数增加了百分之二十四。母牛增加了百分之二十，食用猪增加了百分之七十四，母猪增加了百分之四十二，绵羊增加百分之十三，而鸡则减少了百分之五。和战前一九三七年比较，今年食用猪、母猪和绵羊增加了。而食用牛、母牛和鸡则减少了。和一九四八年比较，今年肉类、乳类、蛋类等的产量增加了，例如，宰牛量增加百分之三十六，宰羊量增加百分之五十三，宰猪量增加百分之一百零七，乳类增加百分之四十一，蛋类增加百分之五十七。和战前一九三七年比较，今年肉类产量和食用牛、食用猪的头数增加了，食用羊的头数没有增减，乳类和蛋类的产量则降低了。今年农产品采购计划大大超过了一九四八年的采购计划。今年可以完成谷类采购计划（即粮食和饲料作物），干草和谷草的计划。但是豆类、含油作物、马铃薯、甜菜、水果、蔬菜和蛇麻草等的采购计划将不能完成。在畜产品方面，今年的食用牛计划大体可以完成，但是乳类和蛋类采购计划将不能完成。农产品采购中社会主义成分所占的比重增加了，今年将达到：在谷类作物的采购中占百分之二十七，在含油作物的采购中占百分之五十二，在马铃薯的采购中占百分之十一，在食用牛和食用羊的采购中占百分之三十，在猪的采购中约占百分之四十七，在家禽的采购中约占百分之十八。从上面列举的材料中可以看出，最近四年以来我们在农业生产方面，特别是在农业牲畜的头数方面，有了一定的进步。但是同样可以明显地看出来，现在的农业生产水平是不够的。我们农业土地面积是有限的。而更重要的是，不要浪费任何一块农业田地。我们的统一农业合作社将在提高每公顷的收获量和畜产率中起越来越大的作用。为了达到这个目的，同时也为了使我们的农村今后过渡到社会主义道路上去，党和政府应特别注意这些统一农业合作社。现在农业合作社和整个农村正在讨论农业合作社章程草案和筹备着全国统一农业合作社代表大会，这个大会将通过这个章程。日益扩大的农业生产合作社的基础和农业生产的总的任务——即提高每公顷的收获量和提高畜产率，已经越来越尖锐地提出并将继续提出农业工作机械化的问题。我们机器拖拉机站的工作今年已稍有改进。一般地讲，应该说，我们农业工作的机械化还是低级的。机器拖拉机站和国家农场现有的拖拉机还没有充分利用。在苏联，机器拖拉机站做着一百七十种田间工作，而我们的机器拖拉机站只能做四十八种田间工作，这说明在农业工作机械化方面，我们是如何落后。我们目前的任务是多方面发展科学工作人员和实际工作者的创造性，并要保证在科学的基础上建立我们的社会主义农业。
    谈到采购问题时，哥特瓦尔德指出，从一九五三年起将在全国实行新的农产品采购制度。新的采购制度将帮助巩固工人阶级和中、小农民的联盟，将促进统一农业合作社的进一步发展。在确定分配额时要取消现存的平均主义作风，这将可以更加有效地限制和排斥富农，这是发展整个农业生产的重要因素。哥特瓦尔德又说，关心人、关心改善他们的生活条件，是在社会主义制度下一切努力的主要目的。斯大林在他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中已经指出，如果说，资本主义基本经济法则是“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”那末社会主义基本经济法则就是“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”在这简短的、斯大林所发现的法则中包含着整个方针和目标，以及达到这一目标的途径。这一斯大林的法则也合乎我们共和国——在建设着社会主义的人民民主共和国的实际情况。谁也不能否认，我们的人民民主制度改善了绝大多数居民的物质和文化状况。劳动农民从大地主和教堂手里获得了土地，他们以适当的价格销售产品已获得保证，他们有可能采取更高级的经济和生产形式团结起来，并通过这种形式获得国家的大力的帮助以提高自己的劳动生产率，同时也提高自己的物质福利。工人，职员，知识分子都脱离了失业或半失业的厄运，每个人能得到工作，能提高产品以及提高自己的工资。我们的儿童受到了前所未有的照顾，他们有了真正幸福的童年，这种童年是我们成年人以前所想都想不到的，在他们面前展开了广阔的道路，通向教育、劳动、幸福和美满生活的道路。
    政府关心年老的和没有劳动能力的公民。疾病费、养老保险费、儿童补助金的支出由一九三七年的五十三亿克朗（捷币）增至一九五二年的五百三十九亿克朗，一九三七年的人口增加率仅为百分之零点三七，而一九五一年已为百分之一点一三。对居民各种免费的措施，例如教育费、保健费、各种社会保险费、假期照领工资等项的支出由一九三七年的五十八亿克朗增至一九五二年的八百十二亿克朗，这一切免费措施在一九三七年占平均工资的百分之十七，而到一九五二年已增为百分之四十二。至于说到对居民的食品和必需的工业产品供应方面，我们是不能满意的，这是因为有能力买这些东西的人增加了。总的说来，我们的食品和工业品的消费量已比战前增加了。但在这方面，战前的水平对我们说来也是不够的。
    接着，哥特瓦尔德分析了供应方面缺点产生的原因。在这里，老实说，现在农业生产——耕作业和畜牧业的生产以及采购的情形是不能满足购买力所提出的需求的。我们的党和政府的政策将继续努力满足居民不断提高的物质和文化的需要，但是，这里谁也不应忘记，我曾在关于苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告中说过：斯大林的社会主义基本经济法则是由三个不可分割的部分组成的，不应忘记，要做到其中的第一部分，即“保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要”，就得完成其中的第二部分和第三部分，即在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善。我认为，这对我们说来也是真正把我们人民引向富足生活的唯一正确的途径。
    现在我来谈谈关于党的几个问题，谈谈新党章草案。
    必须经常提醒全体党员，特别是青年党员：同志，党就是一切！党，而且只有党才是我国人民解放的保证。党，而且只有党才是使那些大人先生们永远不能复辟的保证。党，而且只有党才能保证我们替我们团结起来了的人民建成幸福的社会主义的将来。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    为了要破坏群众对党的信任，破坏党员对领导的信任，阴谋分子曾化了不少的力气，但是他们并没有成功。群众对党的信任重新提高了，这特别是因为群众看到了党能够把异己的、敌对的渣滓从党的队伍中清洗出去，因为党是严肃的，对那些从前被党安置在领导职位上，而现在已辜负了党的信任，变成了叛徒的人尤其毫不宽容。自从把居于领导地位的叛徒清洗出去之后，党的政治工作，组织工作和思想工作更加活跃了。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会在我们党的生活中是一件大事。我们亲身参加了这一过去到现在一直执行着具有世界历史意义的事业的党、列宁—斯大林的党的代表大会。我们亲眼看见，这一被选举出来的党的司令部如何按照斯大林的方式商讨大事，它如何以批评和自我批评的方式来估价自己的事业并对自己提出新的、英勇的任务。这一代表大会本身就教给我们很多的东西。苏联同志们处理事情的方法、方式，他们解决所提出的问题时的明确性和信心，以及他们保证完成任务和达到目的的具体手段，总之，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的整个工作作风是特别值得我们学习的。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会在我们整个社会中，尤其是在我们党内引起了特别的注意。大家不仅读着报纸、小册子和书籍上所发表的代表大会的文件，而且还在学习它们。在党的教育网中将以一个学年的时间来学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的各项材料和文件以及在代表大会前就学习过了的斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。已经不只一次地说过，学习不应该是空洞的和学院式的，主要的是我们在学习这些材料之后能得出一些适合我们条件的结论，以便运用到我们的实际工作中。向这次全国代表会议提出的捷共新党章草案就是要试图根据我们自己的经验和自己的要求，把苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的总结创造性地运用到我们的环境中来。第十九次党代表大会通过的苏联共产党党章体现了苏联共产党数十年来在建设中，在党的工作中，在领导国家和国家的政治、经济、文化建设的工作中，在领导伟大卫国战争的工作中，在胜利以后时期的工作中，在逐渐过渡到共产主义的工作中所获得的丰富经验。
    哥特瓦尔德说，大家知道，我们党的新党章草案已在各级党组织中、党报上经过了广泛的讨论。哥特瓦尔德接着解释了新党章草案的主要条文，并说，我深信这个草案和经过党内讨论后的补充将在全国代表会议上作为新的党内法律通过。他说，当前主要的是把新党章在实践中运用，把党的工作和党员提高到新党章所要求的党员的水平。我相信，新党章将在政治上、组织上和思想上武装全党，去进行新的斗争，进行建设社会主义的新工作（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）。
    几天以前，党的主席团和政府批准了一九五三年，即五年计划最后一年的经济计划。哥特瓦尔德说，我想对这方面提些意见。以即将完成的一九五二年的任务为根据而制订的一九五三年的经济计划是相当高的。计划预定：工业总产量将增加百分之十八点四，国民经济各部门投资总额增加百分之十八，工业劳动生产率提高百分之十五点一，建筑业劳动生产率提高百分之十二点二，工业成本减低百分之五点九，国营及合作社零售贸易额增加百分之三点二等等。哥特瓦尔德指出：根据一九五三年的经济计划，将采取许多措施来减少经济中的不平衡现象，清除阴谋者和怠工者在我们经济中所造成的许多缺点。我们应当尽全力在最短期间内弥补他们所造成的损失。同时，我们应当意识到，我们在明年还不能完全办到这一点。我们一九五三年的经济计划的任务是很繁重的，必须拿出全部力量，集中全党和全体人民的智慧来完成计划。如果我们注意到下面几点，计划是可以完成的，而且一定要完成：
    第一，全党要根据新党章的精神提高全体党员和各级党组织的思想、政治和组织积极性。此外，各级党组织和每个党员应当在自己的活动范围内大大提高代表群众和领导群众的作用；
    第二，要大大提高我们自上到下的经济领导机构的政治水平和专门知识的修养，提高到快将来到的任务对他们要求的水平。我可以肯定地说，我们经济领导的质量的问题是最重要的问题之一；
    第三，我们应当更大胆地把新的年青干部提拔到我们的经济的领导岗位上去，更好地注意他们政治和专门技术的教育，同时，在生产上、新干部的教育工作上还应使用那些赞成现在的人民民主制度的、拥护苏联的旧技术知识分子和科学工作者；
    第四，我们应当极其严格地执行国家纪律和劳动纪律的要求。我们不能再容许有负责人员破坏党和国家的决议而逍遥法外的情形，也不能再容许随随便便不完成任务的情形；
    第五，我们要用一切办法来保证有计划地检查党和政府的决议执行的情形，并要使每个共产党员不认为这是一种委屈，相反的，要欢迎这种检查，并自动要求经常检查他们的工作和活动；
    第六，我们应保证肃清发现了缺点和错误后不立即采取实际措施予以消灭的情形；
    第七，我们要学会更好地、比现在好得更多地鼓励和组织大家的创造精神、社会主义竞赛和革新运动，把全体广大工作人员的技术水平提高到先进工作人员的水平；
    第八，我们要一贯地在各地、在我们经济生活和社会生活的每一方面致力和达到厉行节约、减低成本、提高劳动生产率；
    第九，我们不应该忘记：我们一切努力的最终目的是人，是对人的福利的关心。因此，必须在我们工、农业生产可能性的范围内供应我们居民以必需品和消费品，使它们的总量和购买力及需求完全适应；
    第十，我们不应忘记帝国主义战争贩子，要继续为和平而斗争，要保障共和国的安全和保证国防力量。
    以上这些就是我们目前的主要任务。同志们，我认为，在我们成百万的党员的支持下、在千百万非党群众的支持下，在整个民族阵线的支持下，我们一定能够完成这些任务。我们能够完成这些任务还因为：我们有苏联和斯大林同志本人的帮助。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声，全场起立，有节拍地高呼：“斯大林—哥特瓦尔德—和平！”接着又是一阵掌声，转为欢呼，欢呼光荣的苏联共产党，欢呼劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林，欢呼捷克斯洛伐克共产党及其敬爱的主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德。）
