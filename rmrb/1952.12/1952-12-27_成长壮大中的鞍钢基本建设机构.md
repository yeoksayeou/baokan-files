    The Growing and Expanding Capital Construction Organization of Anshan Iron and Steel
    Gu Ming
    Whether or not capital construction tasks can be completed depends critically on the ability to rapidly gather and cultivate strength, and continuously enrich and expand capital construction organizations. Since Anshan Iron and Steel Company entered a period of large-scale construction in 1952, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, it resolutely adjusted the forces of production and capital construction, making the capital construction organization a relatively complete organizational system, carrying out construction under concentrated and unified conditions.
    Currently, among the eight managers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, four are exclusively in charge of capital construction, and two are concurrently in charge of capital construction. In March of this year, the leadership transferred a large number of key leaders, general cadres, and technical cadres from production factories and mines to enrich various departments of capital construction, reformed the old capital construction organization, and established twelve sections, including secretarial, planning, geology, design, finance, materials, equipment, labor and wages, engineering management, organization, propaganda and education, and security. In order to strive for specialized division of labor, Anshan Iron and Steel established four engineering companies for civil construction, machine installation, electrical installation, and metal structure, as well as a furnace building factory. The civil construction company has affiliated sanitary equipment installation engineering offices, processing plants (cement mixing, steel bar, carpentry, cinder brick factories, etc.), and mechanized supply stations. In the future, as tasks expand, these affiliated institutions can also become specialized engineering companies. In addition, Anshan Iron and Steel established four major construction site management organizations. The four major construction sites have a total of fifty-six construction teams. In order to strengthen political work in capital construction, Anshan Iron and Steel also established a political department. The political department has fifteen political sections under its jurisdiction, distributed in various engineering companies, key construction sites, and major business sections. Anshan Iron and Steel, due to the transfer of cadres from production departments and the supply of cadres from all over the country, has a large number of veteran cadres, technical workers, and technical cadres, and university students transferred to the capital construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel. At present, compared with March of this year, the strength of capital construction has increased eightfold for cadres at the section chief level and above, two and a half times for technical personnel, twofold for staff, and fourfold for workers. This relatively complete organization and relatively strong construction force have rapidly exerted their role. Although Anshan Iron and Steel's tasks this year are several times greater than last year, and major projects only started in July, the speed of project progress is very fast. By the end of November, the 0190 construction site had completed 87.37% of the annual plan (only 19.94% was completed in July), and the 0230 construction site had completed 72.22% of the annual plan (19.77% was completed in July).
    Before 1951, the capital construction organization of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was relatively simple. In 1949, Anshan Iron and Steel only had a repair and manufacturing department. The repair and manufacturing department led four offices (general affairs, drafting, engineering, and engineering) and four factories (construction, riveting, electrical repair, and machine repair), with a total of 4,463 employees. Under the conditions of insufficient number of employees, lack of technical personnel and cadres, and a very simple capital construction organization, Anshan Iron and Steel was able to quickly restore production mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party and higher-level organs, and the relatively easy restoration work. Although there was a lack of construction experience at the time, we were able to rely on the working class, give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and overcome many difficulties. Insufficient equipment was a major problem, but the dedication of equipment by all employees in Anshan solved this difficulty. The technical requirements during the restoration period were relatively simple, and the main force was concentrated on construction. Old technical workers played a technical role in construction, becoming the main force and backbone in the restoration work, temporarily overcoming the shortage of technical personnel. Soviet experts also came one after another, and they played a decisive role in the restoration work, such as the restoration of the No. 4 blast furnace and the coking oven, which benefited from the help of Soviet experts.
    After 1951, during the transition period of Anshan Iron and Steel Company from restoration to construction, the contradiction between objective requirements and subjective forces became increasingly obvious. On the one hand, the scale of capital construction in Anshan Iron and Steel was expanding day by day: although the overall design and the design of the two major projects, 0190 and 0230, were assisted by the Soviet Union, Anshan Iron and Steel had to supply various geological data and various drawings. On the other hand, the proportion of company production increased, and seven of the eight managers were exclusively in charge of production, which relatively weakened the leadership of capital construction. Therefore, after the decision to strengthen capital construction was issued by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government in the second half of 1951, Anshan Iron and Steel continued to transfer cadres to enrich the capital construction forces. The capital construction organization was separated from production and became an independent organization, and the system of double contracting for both Party A and Party B was implemented, moving towards enterprise management.
    Since this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has actually begun to carry out large-scale capital construction. The state requires that Anshan Iron and Steel must be built into a factory with a production capacity several times higher than the highest level of the puppet Manchukuo within the next few years, a factory where resources are used rationally, equipment capacity is fully utilized, and production is balanced, and a mechanized and automated factory with high labor productivity, completely eliminating all the poisonous legacies left by past colonial-style predatory operations. Whether Anshan Iron and Steel can quickly complete its construction tasks is related to the development of the national industrial construction. In order to achieve this arduous and complex task, the leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel clearly recognized the following points: first, the success or failure of future capital construction will have a huge impact on the country's economic construction; second, there are insufficient production cadres, but there are fundamentally no cadres in capital construction, and to solve the problem of insufficient capital construction forces, it is necessary to "cut leeks" from the production departments; third, production is relatively stable and normal, and leading cadres have been able to initially grasp its laws, while capital construction technology is complex, there are many problems, and leading cadres and other personnel do not understand or are not familiar with it, and have even never seen or heard of it; fourth, if we want to build Anshan Iron and Steel well within a few years and accumulate experience and lay a foundation for the national heavy industry construction, we must quickly expand our strength and establish a strong capital construction organization. After unifying their thinking, Anshan Iron and Steel began to reform the old organization, making it a complete organization that truly leads capital construction.
    What are the main characteristics of the current capital construction organization of Anshan Iron and Steel Company? First, the leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel resolutely implemented the instructions of the higher authorities, truly placed capital construction in a primary position, and concentrated the main leadership on capital construction. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC also placed the focus of its work on capital construction; the whole Party unified its thinking, unified its understanding, and quickly transferred a large number of cadres from the production departments to strengthen the forces of capital construction. Second, learn and accept the experience of Soviet capital construction, implement specialized division of labor, which is convenient for improving business leadership and improving technical level. Experience has proved that the reason why Anshan Iron and Steel can initially learn to master complex construction techniques and advanced Soviet experience in a short period of time is the result of implementing specialized division of labor. Because specialization makes it easier to train technical personnel and technical workers, and also facilitates the accumulation of construction experience and accelerates the speed of construction. Third, seriously strengthen geological exploration and design work. The task of prospecting for mineral resources required by Anshan Iron and Steel covers the entire Northeast. In the next few years, tens of tons of design drawings from home and abroad will be required, and the translation of texts alone will amount to tens of millions of words each year. Without correct data, design cannot be carried out, and without correct design, construction cannot be carried out. In order to strengthen exploration and design work, half of Anshan Iron and Steel's technical force is concentrated in the design department and the geological department. Fourth, the characteristics of capital construction are seasonality, mobility, and decentralization. Without strong political work, it is impossible to guide all employees to a common goal of building the motherland. For this reason, the capital construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel has specially established a strong and powerful political department, which has played a great role in capital construction. Fifth, in terms of construction site management, the Soviet general contracting and subcontracting system is adopted, which facilitates close coordination and connection between various specialized engineering companies; specialized companies and construction sites are equipped with full-time technical supply managers, so that material supply and financial management at construction sites can reduce confusion and disputes, in order to achieve unity and concentration. Next year, Anshan Iron and Steel will further implement contracting for both labor and materials, and implement the economic accounting system. Sixth, the general engineering management department of Anshan Iron and Steel also has a complete set of technical supervision and inspection institutions from top to bottom; and has electromechanical, grease, raw materials, concrete, brick, soil, pressure resistance test and research and analysis equipment, as well as measurement and inspection teams, so as to check, research and improve project quality at any time. These organizations conduct project acceptance in a timely manner and correct the phenomenon of neglecting quality at various construction sites. Seventh, all levels of organizations in the capital construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel, down to the work section, have complete dispatching agencies, with commander telephones distributed in various places, various professional companies, and various construction sites, forming a capital construction dispatching network to supervise the implementation and implementation of superior orders, reflect the daily project completion status, and conduct daily tool equipment, human resources, material resources, and financial resources dispatching according to the intentions and planned indicators of the leadership.
    Old China's industry was backward, and the reactionary ruling class in the past did not carry out large-scale heavy industry construction, so they left us with very little construction experience. After liberation, from the beginning of the restoration of production period to the current period of large-scale construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, under the guidance of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, especially with the direct help of Soviet experts, has gradually built a set of specialized institutions in three years according to the development of construction. In the future, Anshan Iron and Steel will further accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, combine it with the development of construction, and further improve the current organizational structure to make it more complete, more substantial and powerful, so as to undertake more arduous tasks in the future, train more cadres, technical personnel, and technical workers, and create conditions for large-scale economic construction across the country!

    成长壮大中的鞍钢基本建设机构
    顾明
    能否完成基本建设任务，关键在于能否迅速集结与培养力量，不断充实与壮大基本建设机构。鞍山钢铁公司自一九五二年进入大规模建设时期以后，在中央和东北局、东北人民政府工业部的直接领导下，坚决地调整了生产与基本建设的力量，使基本建设的机构成为较完整的组织系统，在集中统一的条件下进行建设。
    目前，鞍山钢铁公司八个经理中除四人专管基本建设外，尚有二人兼管基本建设，领导方面今年三月曾抽调大批生产厂矿的主要领导骨干、一般干部、技术干部，充实基本建设各部门，改革旧的基本建设机构，成立了秘书、计划、地质、设计、财务、材料、设备、劳动工资、工程管理、组织、宣教、保卫等十二处。为力求分工专业化，鞍钢分别建立了土木建筑、机器安装、电气安装、金属结构四个工程公司和一个筑炉厂。土木建筑公司下附设卫生设备安装工程处、加工厂（洋灰搅拌、钢筋、木工、矿渣砖等厂）、机械化供应站等，将来任务扩大，这些附属机构也可成为专业工程公司。此外，鞍钢成立了四大工地管理机构。四大工地共有五十六个工程队。为了加强基本建设的政治工作，鞍钢又成立了政治部。政治部下辖十五个政治处，政治处分布于各工程公司，各重点工地和主要业务处。鞍钢由于从生产部门抽调干部，和全国各地供应干部，调来鞍钢基本建设部门的有大批老干部、技术工人、技术干部、大学生。目前，基本建设力量和今年三月相比，科长以上干部增加了八倍，技术人员增加二倍半，职员增加二倍，工人增加四倍。这一较为完整的机构和较为强大的建设力量，已迅速发生了它的作用。虽然鞍钢今年的任务比去年大数倍，主要工程七月才开工，但工程进展的速度非常快，到十一月底，○一九○工地完成年计划百分之八十七点三七（七月份仅完成百分之十九点九四），○二三○工地完成年计划百分之七十二点二二（七月份完成百分之十九点七七）。
    一九五一年以前，鞍山钢铁公司的基本建设机构是比较简单的。一九四九年，鞍钢仅设有一个修造部。修造部领导四室（总务、制图、工务、工程师）和四厂（营缮、铆造、电修、机修），职工总数为四千四百六十三人。在职工数量不足、技术人员和干部缺乏，基本建设机构又非常简单的条件下，鞍钢所以能迅速恢复生产，主要是由于党和上级机关的正确领导，和修复工作比较容易。当时虽然缺乏修建经验，但是我们却能够依靠工人阶级，发挥他们的积极性和创造性，克服了许多困难。设备不足曾是重大问题，但鞍山全市职工献纳器材，就解决了这个困难。修复时期技术要求比较简单，主要力量集中于施工，老技术工人在施工中发挥了技术作用，成为修复工作中的主力和骨干，暂时地克服了技术人员不足的困难。苏联专家也陆续来了，他们对修复工作起了决定性的作用，如四高炉和焦炉的修复都得力于苏联专家的帮助。
    一九五一年以后，鞍山钢铁公司从修复走向建设的过渡时期，客观要求与主观力量的矛盾日益明显。一方面，鞍钢的基本建设规模日益扩大：总体设计及○一九○和○二三○两大工程设计虽然是由苏联帮助，但鞍钢必须供给以各种地质资料及各种图纸。另一方面，公司生产比重加大，八个经理中有七个专管生产，这对基本建设的领导也相对削弱。因此，在一九五一年下半年，在中共中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部加强基本建设的决定发出以后，鞍钢即继续抽调干部，充实基本建设力量。基本建设机构从生产中分出来成为独立的组织，并实行甲乙双包工合同制，走向企业化管理。
    今年以来，鞍山钢铁公司实际上已开始进行巨大规模的基本建设。国家要求在今后数年内必须把鞍钢建设成为生产能力超过伪满最高水平数倍的工厂，成为资源被合理使用、设备能力充分发挥、生产平衡的工厂，成为具有高度劳动生产率的机械化的自动化的工厂，完全清除过去殖民地式掠夺性经营所遗留下的一切毒害。鞍钢之能否迅速完成建设任务关系着全国工业建设的发展。为实现这一艰巨复杂的任务，鞍钢领导干部明确认识了以下几点：第一，今后的基本建设的成败对国家的经济建设影响巨大；第二，生产干部不足，但基本建设则根本没有干部，解决基本建设力量不足问题，必须从生产部门“割韭菜”；第三，生产已较为稳定正常，领导干部已能初步掌握其规律，基本建设技术复杂，问题很多，领导干部和其他人员不懂不熟，甚至见所未见闻所未闻；第四，我们要在数年之内建设好鞍钢，为全国重工业建设积累经验，打下基础，必须迅速扩大力量，建立强有力的基本建设机构。统一思想之后，鞍钢即着手改革旧的机构，使其成为真正领导基本建设的完整的组织。
    鞍山钢铁公司目前的基本建设机构主要特点在那里呢？第一，鞍钢领导方面坚决地执行了上级的指示，真正把基本建设放在首要地位，领导主力集中搞基本建设，中共鞍山市委也把工作重点放在基本建设方面；全党思想统一，认识统一，迅速地从生产部门抽调大批干部加强了基本建设的力量。第二，学习并接受苏联基本建设的经验，实行专业分工，便于改进业务领导和提高技术水平。经验证明：鞍钢之所以能在短时期内，初步学会掌握复杂的施工技术和苏联先进经验，是实行专业化分工的结果。因为专业化更容易培养训练技术人员和技术工人，也便于积累建设经验，加速建设的速度。第三，认真加强了地质勘察和设计工作。鞍钢所需矿源勘察任务遍及全东北，今后数年内国内外设计图纸达数十吨，仅文字翻译每年就有几千万字。没有正确的资料便不能进行设计，而没有正确的设计就不能施工。为了加强勘察和设计工作，鞍钢有一半的技术力量集中于设计处和地质处。第四，基本建设的特点是季节性、流动性和分散性大，没有坚强的政治工作，便不能把全体职工引导到一个建设祖国的共同的目标上去。为此，鞍钢基本建设部门特地建立了坚强有力的政治部，在基本建设中起了很大作用。第五，在工地管理方面采取了苏联的总包和分包制，便于各专业工程公司密切配合联系；专业公司和工地都设有专职技术供应的经理，使工地材料供应和财务管理减少混乱和纠纷，以达到统一集中。明年鞍钢将更进一步实行包工包料，贯彻经济核算制。第六，鞍钢总的工程管理处尚有一整套从上而下较为完整的技术监督及检验机构；并有机电、油脂、原材料、混凝土、砖石、土壤、耐压试验和研究分析设备，以及测量检查队，以便随时检查、研究和改进工程质量。这些组织机构及时进行工程验收，纠正各工地忽视质量的现象。第七，鞍钢基本建设部门各级组织直至工段，有完整的调度机构，以司令电话分布各处、各专业公司、各工地，构成基本建设调度网，以监督上级命令的执行和贯彻，反映每日工程完成情况，并根据领导方面的意图和计划指标，进行日常工具设备、人力、物力、财力的调度。
    旧中国的工业落后，过去的反动统治阶级没有进行过大规模的重工业建设，所以，他们留给我们的建设经验很少。解放后，从开始恢复生产时期一直到现在的规模巨大的建设时期，鞍山钢铁公司根据建设的发展，在中央和东北局、东北人民政府工业部指导下，尤其是在苏联专家的直接帮助下，三年中终于逐步建设起来了一套专业化的机构。今后鞍钢将进一步接受苏联的先进经验，结合建设的发展，进一步改进目前的组织机构，使它更完整、更加充实有力，以便担当起今后更加艰巨的任务，培养更多的干部、技术人员、技术工人，为全国大规模的经济建设创造条件！
