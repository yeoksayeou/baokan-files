    Since the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, material exchange in the Northwest region has further increased. This 활발한 material exchange is clearly reflected in the growth of railway revenue. According to statistics: From October 6th, when the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway began passenger transport, and October 7th, when freight transport began, to the end of November, a total of 55 days, the operating income of the Tianshui-Lanzhou and Baoji-Tianshui lines was equivalent to 2.4 times the total operating income of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway in 1951.

    Among the materials transported by rail, most of the goods transported from west to east are local specialties from Gansu, Qinghai and other places, including: more than 8,600 tons of mineral oil, 3,266 tons of edible salt, and 1,352 tons of wool. Most of the goods transported from east to west are construction materials and industrial raw materials, including machinery, grain, cement, cotton, and daily necessities. Taking the freight volume of Lanzhou Station as an example, a total of 1,562 tons of machinery and steel materials, 3,861 tons of cement, more than 11,600 tons of grain, 1,841 tons of cotton yarn and cloth, and 489 tons of tea, which is most needed by ethnic minorities, were transported from the east. Kelp, fennel and other foods were also transported by entire train from Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places. Sweet potatoes from Henan and persimmons from Tianshui also appeared in large quantities on the streets of Lanzhou.

    After the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, freight rates were reduced, and the cost of goods was lowered. Prices in large and small towns west of Gansu have fallen to varying degrees. The price of department stores in Lanzhou in October decreased by 1.1 to 24.85 percent, and the purchasing power of farmers and herdsmen increased relatively.

    In order to better serve the people with the railway and strive for greater revenue in 1953, various transportation departments of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway are carrying out red flag competitions, strengthening freight work, and promoting material exchange.

    (Another dispatch) All employees of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau are actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "continue to work hard to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway" and are carrying out the construction project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. On December 1st, rail laying began from Lanzhou East Station to Lanzhou West Station. The workers braved the wind and snow to nail the tracks, and nailed 1.9 kilometers on the first day. The subgrade project from Lanzhou Main Station to Hekou has also started on December 4th. With the help of Soviet experts, a major bridge on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has also begun construction. Workers are working in water more than four meters deep in temperatures below minus ten degrees, demonstrating the tenacious spirit of overcoming all difficulties.

    天兰铁路通车后西北物资交流显著活跃
    西北铁路干线工程局职工努力修筑兰新铁路
    天兰铁路通车后，西北区物资交流进一步活跃起来。物资交流的活跃显著地表现在铁路营业额的增长上。据统计：自十月六日天兰铁路开办客运、七日开办货运以来，至十一月底的五十五天中，天兰、宝天两线的营业收入，相当于宝天铁路一九五一年全年营业收入的二点四倍。
    在铁路运输的物资中，从西向东运的大部是甘肃、青海等地的土特产，计有：矿物油八千六百多吨，食盐三千二百六十六吨，羊毛一千三百五十二吨。由东向西运的大部分是建筑器材和工业原料，计有机械、粮食、水泥、棉花和日用品等。只以兰州车站的货运来计算，从东运来的机械和钢铁器材共有一千五百六十二吨，水泥三千八百六十一吨，粮食一万一千六百多吨，花纱布类一千八百四十一吨，少数民族最需要饮用的茶叶四百八十九吨。海带、茴香等食品也整车地由上海、广州等地运来。河南的红薯和天水的柿子，也大批出现在兰州街头。
    天兰铁路通车后，物资的运费减低了，商品的成本降低了。甘肃以西大、小市镇的物价，都有程度不同的下降。兰州市十月份百货价格降低百分之一点一至二四点八五，农、牧民的购买力因而相对提高。
    为了使铁路更好地为人民服务，争取一九五三年更大的收入，天兰铁路各个运输部门正在开展红旗竞赛，加强货运工作，促进物资交流。
    （又讯）西北铁路干线工程局全体职工，积极地响应毛主席“继续努力修筑兰新路”的伟大号召，正进行兰新铁路的修建工程。十二月一日，开始由兰州东车站向西车站铺轨，工友们冒着风雪钉道，第一天就钉了一点九公里。兰州总站至河口一段路基工程，也已于十二月四日动工。在苏联专家帮助下，兰新铁路上的某大桥，也已动工。工友们在零下十度的气候中，在四公尺多深的水里工作着，表现了战胜一切困难的顽强精神。
