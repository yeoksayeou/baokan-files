The representatives from all over the world who came to participate in the World People's Peace Congress have victoriously completed the missions entrusted to them by the people of their respective countries, and are now leaving Vienna to return to their homelands. The representatives bid each other warm farewells, wished each other well, and expressed hope for new achievements in the struggle to defend peace. The eight days of the conference strengthened the confidence of those who were already peace warriors, dispelled the doubts of those who had questioned the peace movement, and strengthened the unity among the people of various countries. The great documents adopted on the morning of the 20th – the Letter from the World People's Peace Congress to the Governments of the Five Great Powers and the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress – will become a common program for peace-loving people and will mobilize even broader segments of the population to fight for peace.

Anyone who witnessed the jubilation, singing, and dancing of the masses at the closing of the congress will never forget the Vienna Congress, will never forget the enthusiastic welcome given to the proposals of the three working committees of the congress – the Committee on National Independence and International Security, the Committee on Ending Existing Wars, and the Committee on Easing International Tensions – the joyous jumping and cheering when the Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers and the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress were adopted, and the twenty minutes of cheering and applause following the closing speech by Italian parliamentarian Nitti. Every cheer, every standing ovation, every shout of "Long live peace," every song praising peace, every waving headscarf, every pair of eyes filled with tears of emotion demonstrated the will of the people – the will to demand peace and to fight unyieldingly for peace. The touching scene of people holding hands, chanting "Peace" in unison in various languages, is forever etched in people's hearts.

Over one thousand eight hundred representatives, in the eight days of the congress and committee meetings, freely and fully exchanged opinions, repeatedly deliberated, reached common understandings, and crystallized them into two major documents: the Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers and the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress. Never before in history has there been such a congress, drawing representatives from so many countries, representing so many political views and religious beliefs, so many different social strata, able to come together in a spirit of consultation to discuss and resolve issues vital to the fate of all humanity – peace.

According to the report of World Peace Council Secretary-General Laffargue: attending the congress were: one thousand six hundred and four delegates, one hundred and five guests, one hundred and two observers, and forty-six representatives of international organizations, of whom about four hundred had never previously participated in the peace movement. The success of the congress fully demonstrates that it is entirely possible for people to reach consensus on the issue of peace, and the peace movement has greatly expanded its base as a result of this congress.

The delegates present came from every corner of the world. Professor Joliot-Curie announced on the first day of the congress that there were seventy-two countries represented, and by the last day this number had increased to eighty-five, with the national flags of various countries hanging on both sides of the presidium constantly increasing. The delegates present came from all over the world, including from the tropics, from Iceland, from nearby Vienna, and also from remote and little-known areas such as Senegal and Transvaal. The representatives of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies, accounted for less than one-seventh of the total number of delegates, but they represented the entire people of these countries, including outstanding workers, peasants, intellectuals, people from various fraternal nationalities, and people with various religious beliefs. The Chinese delegation also included representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors.

The delegations from the capitalist world represented a wide range of social strata with various political views.

The Italian delegation was the largest at the congress, with one hundred and ninety-eight people. Although the Italian government ordered the Italian delegation not to go to Austria and blockaded the Italian-Austrian border, the Italian delegation still had the most people present, which is particularly significant. The Italian delegation included well-known leaders of the peace movement such as Senators Sereni and Donini, as well as many people who had never participated in the peace movement before. It is worth mentioning the "Parliamentary Liaison Committee for Peace" headed by Nitti, a group including members of the Liberal Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, as well as non-partisans. Nitti himself is a Liberal and served as Prime Minister of Italy before Mussolini came to power. He is a proponent of "European Neutrality." Nitti had expressed doubts about whether peace supporters could truly cooperate with those outside the peace movement. In a letter to Joliot-Curie on September 25, he explicitly requested Joliot-Curie's guarantee of freedom of speech before participating in the congress. After the congress, Nitti said very satisfied: in the congress, representatives of all races, all nations, all religious beliefs, all thoughts, and all parties had the fullest freedom to express their opinions, "Professor Joliot-Curie's promise in that valuable letter has been fulfilled." Nitti represented those liberals in Europe who are unwilling to be enslaved by the United States. They increasingly feel the threat of the United States to national independence and national security, and increasingly feel the need to fight for peace. At the congress, he spoke angrily about the enslavement of Italy by the United States, saying: "After the Marshall Plan came the Atlantic Pact, followed by the establishment of military bases... today some people are talking about the European Army... if we cannot find a way to defend ourselves, we will soon be at the command of the U.S. General Staff... they will rule our country like masters." The Italian delegation also included royalists, trade union leaders, professors, writers, and representatives from various other fields.

The second largest delegation was the French delegation. In addition to the wide range of parties represented, the participation of French writer Jean-Paul Sartre attracted considerable attention from Western European intellectuals. A bourgeois newspaper in France even spread rumors that Sartre would not attend the congress, and even if he did, he would not speak. But on the very first day of the congress, Sartre spoke, talking about the value of the congress as a meeting of the people, where the people of the world come to build peace. He spoke of the possibility of peaceful coexistence between two systems and denounced war-mongers. The participation of this bourgeois writer, who had previously been very distant from the peace movement, indicated the expansion of the peace movement among French intellectuals. The French delegation also included a considerable number of Catholics. Disregarding the Pope's ban, they resolutely attended the congress and voted in favor of the congress's two documents.

Of the one hundred and fifty-two members of the British delegation, more than half were members of the Labor Party. The entire delegation voted in favor of the congress's two documents, with no one opposing or abstaining. Most of them were attending a peace conference for the first time, and the representatives were elected by the masses at various large and small gatherings, and travel expenses were raised by the masses through donations of pennies. Like France and Italy, Britain is also suffering deeply from the consequences of the U.S. policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, which is prompting more people to join the struggle for peace.

Of particular interest at the congress was the formation of a unified German delegation by representatives of the people of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. Many members of this unified delegation had never participated in the peace movement before. At the congress, Elfes, representing all the German delegates, presented a declaration to the congress, which was based on and supplemented the resolution on the peaceful settlement of the German question adopted at the International Conference for a Peaceful Settlement of the German Question held in Berlin in November. Former Weimar Republic Chancellor Wirth was a representative from West Germany in the German delegation. He arrived in Vienna the day before the congress opened, along with forty-five other representatives from West Germany. Facing the danger of the revival of militarism and suffering from the pain of division, the people of Germany have forced this elderly statesman to come out and appeal for peace. He believes that the solution of the German problem will help to ease international tensions. The German delegation also included the Speaker of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, the General Secretary of the Christian Democratic Union of the German Democratic Republic, Gotting, and West German parliamentarian Dahlem.

The American people were prevented by the Washington authorities from sending their most famous peace fighters to the congress, but twenty-seven representatives still came. One of the heads of the delegation was George Hayward, a trade union worker from the San Francisco branch of the American Federation of Labor. The American delegation included seventeen women, reflecting a characteristic of the American peace movement, namely, that women are particularly active in the peace movement.

The same breadth was also reflected in the composition of the delegations from the Eastern and Latin American countries. The Indian delegation included members of the Congress Party, Gandhians, Communists, People's Party members, Workers and Peasants Party members, and members of the "All India Forward Bloc." The Japanese delegation included the grandson of Prince Saionji Kimmochi, who is a member of the Japanese parliament. The head of the Indonesian delegation was the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Indonesian Parliament, and the Colombian delegation included the General Secretary of the Socialist Party.

Representatives of the colonial peoples overcame many difficulties to attend the congress. Although the French colonial authorities imprisoned ten of the eleven representatives from Tunisia or confiscated their passports, one representative still came to Vienna. This representative's report at the congress received the sympathy of all participants, especially the French representatives. In addition, almost all colonial peoples of Africa sent their representatives to attend the congress, and their demands for national independence received strong support from the congress. The majority of the representatives attending this congress supported peace and opposed war out of their own self-interest. Argentine representative Etcheverry is a farmer who only learned about the peace movement three or four months ago. The threat to the self-interest of Argentine farmers prompted him to attend this congress. Icelandic representative Hettermann is a biology student who said: "Many foreign military bases have been established in our country, and our greatest demand is to protect our land and people from destruction, so we want peace."

A French colonel named Pietre attended this congress, and he had also never participated in the peace movement. He had fought three battles and been wounded. In the war, eighty-four of his relatives died, and forty thousand people died in his hometown of Corsica, so he asked the congress to prevent German militarism from reviving and to eliminate the danger of a new world war.

Athletes are also opposed to war, they know that sports can only be developed in peacetime. There were many athletes among the delegates from various countries. Czechoslovak world long-distance running champion Zatopek attended the congress, and German representative Pelzer, the winner of the 1926 1500-meter world championship, also participated in the congress.

Many people also attended the congress in their individual capacity, such as French chemist Tetri, who is a Catholic. West German representative Hoberle is a seventy-four-year-old painter who has traveled to many European countries. He said that the Second World War destroyed many of the elaborate works of my life, which aroused my concern for the issue of peace and war.

The breadth of the representatives at the Vienna Congress shows that the aggressive and war policies of the United States threaten the vital interests of the people of all countries, threaten the national independence and national security of all countries, and the implementation of this policy has a serious danger of dragging the people of all countries back into another world war. This has made people of different political and religious beliefs, different social occupations, and different colors increasingly active in fighting for peace.

The breadth of participation at the Vienna Congress reflects this characteristic of the current world situation. It is precisely for this reason that, as Nitti said in his closing remarks: "The joint work and mutual understanding of the past few days have turned many of us into friends, with mutual affection."

A congress including figures with such broad representation, after full consultation, finally almost unanimously adopted a clear common program – the Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers and the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress, which is indeed a great victory for the peace movement. It is particularly noteworthy that: the resolution of the congress advocated that the five great powers immediately conduct consultations to conclude a peace treaty, which the U.S. government has long refused. The resolution of the congress advocated an immediate cessation of the Korean War, which the U.S. government has long opposed. The resolution of the congress pointed out that the U.S. military was conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China and demanded an immediate halt to this heinous measure, which the U.S. government has consistently denied. The resolution of the congress advocated that the People's Republic of China enjoy its rightful place in the United Nations, which the U.S. government has consistently obstructed. In addition, the congress also proposed principles for resolving problems in the interests of the people of the world on issues such as the cessation of the wars in Vietnam and Malaya, national independence, the German question, the Japanese question, the Austrian question, universal disarmament, and economic and cultural exchange. The two documents of the congress will undoubtedly become powerful weapons for mobilizing and uniting the people of the world more broadly to fight for peace, and the peace movement in various countries will undoubtedly develop further.

    团结在和平旗帜下
    ——世界人民和平大会的巨大成就
    新华社记者　郑德芳
    从全世界各地前来参加世界人民和平大会的代表们，已胜利地完成了各国人民托付他们的使命，正纷纷地离开维也纳回到他们的国家去。代表们彼此热情地告别，互祝珍重，并祝在保卫和平的斗争中获得新的成就。八天的会议使原来就是和平战士的人更增加了信心，使对和平运动曾有怀疑的人解除了怀疑，使各国人民间的团结加强了，二十日早晨通过的伟大文件——世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书和世界人民和平大会宣言，将成为爱好和平的人们的共同纲领，将动员更广泛的人为和平而斗争。
    看到过大会闭幕时的群众的欢呼、歌唱、跳跃的盛况的人，永远忘不了维也纳的大会，忘不了大会组织的三个小组委员会——民族独立与国际安全问题委员会、结束现行战争问题委员会、缓和国际紧张形势问题委员会——的建议案所受到的热烈欢迎，在通过致五大国政府书和世界人民和平大会宣言时的欢欣跳跃，在意大利议员尼蒂致闭幕词后的长达二十分钟之久的欢呼鼓掌。每一次欢呼、每一次起立、每一次高呼和平万岁的口号、每一支歌颂和平的歌、每一条挥舞着的头巾、每一双含着激动的眼泪的眼睛都表明了人民的意志——要求和平、不屈不挠地为和平而斗争的意志。人们手牵着手，用各种语言齐声高呼“和平”的动人的场面，是永远印在人们的心里的。
    一千八百多名代表在八天的大会、小组委员会中，自由而充分地交换意见，反复商讨，得到了共同的意见，结晶为致五大国政府书和世界人民和平大会宣言两大文件。从来历史上还没有过这样的大会，来自那样多的国家，代表着那样多的政治见解和宗教信仰，那么多不同的社会阶层的人们，能够在一起以协商精神来讨论和解决与全人类命运攸关的问题——和平。
    据世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德的报告：出席大会的有：一千六百零四名代表，一百零五名来宾，一百零二名列席代表和四十六名国际组织的代表，他们中间约有四百人以前一直没有参加过和平运动。大会的成功充分说明了人民在和平问题上取得一致意见是完全可能的，和平运动已因这次大会而大大地扩大了它的基础。
    到会的代表来自全世界每一角落，约里奥—居里教授在大会第一天宣布到会国家有七十二个，到最后一天这数目已经增加到八十五个，大会主席台两边所挂的各国国旗常有增加。到会的代表来自全世界各地，包括来自热带的，来自冰岛的，来自近在维也纳市的，也有来自远在塞内加尔、德兰士瓦等不大为人所知的偏僻地区的。苏联、中国、人民民主国家的代表，占全体代表人数不到七分之一，他们代表着这些国家的全体人民，他们中间有优秀的工人、农民、知识分子，他们中间包括来自各种不同的兄弟民族和抱有各种不同的宗教信仰的人们。在中国代表团里还有工商业界的代表。
    资本主义世界各国的代表团，代表着各种不同的政治见解的广泛的社会阶层。
    意大利代表团是大会上最大的一个，有一百九十八人。虽然意大利政府下令禁止意大利代表团前往奥地利，并封锁意奥边境，可是意大利代表团到会的人数还是最多，这是特别有意义的。意大利代表团里有和平运动的著名领袖如上议院议员塞伦尼、多尼尼等人，还有许多过去从未参加过和平运动的人士。值得提起的是以尼蒂为首的“议会联络和平委员会”，这个集团里有自由党、天主教民主党、社会民主党的党员以及无党派人士。尼蒂本人是一个自由党人，在墨索里尼当权以前曾做过意大利首相，是“欧洲中立”的主张者。尼蒂曾对于和平拥护者能否真正与和平运动以外的人合作表示怀疑，他在九月二十五日给约里奥—居里的信中就明白地要求约里奥—居里保证能自由发表意见才参加这次大会。经过这次大会，尼蒂非常满意地说：在大会上各个种族、各个民族、各种宗教信仰、各种思想、各个政党的代表都有发表意见的最充分的自由，“约里奥—居里教授那一封极有价值的信里所答应的诺言已经实现了”。尼蒂代表了欧洲那些不愿受美国奴役的自由主义者，他们日益感到美国对民族独立与国家安全的威胁，日益感觉到要为和平而斗争。他在大会上愤怒地讲到美国对意大利的奴役，他说：“马歇尔计划之后来了大西洋公约，之后是建立军事基地，……今天又有人谈着欧洲军，……如果我们找不到保卫自己的办法，我们很快地就将听命于美国的参谋本部……他们将像主人一样的统治我国。”意大利代表团里还有保皇主义者、有工会领袖、教授、作家等各方面的代表。
    第二个大代表团是法国代表团，除了代表的党派方面的广泛性外，法国作家让·保罗·萨特的参加大会引起了西欧知识分子很大的注意，法国有一家资产阶级报纸还专门放出谣言，说萨特不会来参加大会，即使参加也不会发言。但是就在大会的第一天，萨特就发言了，他讲到大会的可贵之处，就在于它是一个人民的会议，世界人民到这里来建立和平。他谈到两个制度和平共处是可能的，并痛斥了战争挑拨者。这位曾经与和平运动有很大距离的资产阶级作家的参加大会，表示了在法国知识分子中间和平运动的扩大。在法国代表团里还有相当数量的天主教徒。他们不顾罗马教皇的禁令，毅然出席了这次大会，并且投票支持大会的两个文件。
    英国代表团一百五十二人中，有一半以上是工党党员，代表团全体都投票赞成大会的两个文件，没有一人反对，也没有一人弃权。他们中间多数是第一次参加和平会议，代表是在不同的大小集会上由群众选出来的，旅费是靠群众几个辨士几个辨士的捐款凑起来的。英国也和法国及意大利一样，正深受美国扩军备战政策的恶果，这促使更多的人投入和平的斗争里来。
    大会中引人注意的是德意志民主共和国和西德的人民代表组成了一个统一的德国代表团，这个统一的代表团里面有不少是过去从未参加过和平运动的。在大会上，艾尔费斯代表德国全体代表向大会提出一项宣言，这个宣言是根据十一月间在柏林召开的国际争取和平解决德国问题会议上通过的和平解决德国问题的决议并加以补充拟就的。前魏玛共和国总理维尔特是德国代表团里来自西德的代表，他在大会开幕前一天就和西德四十五位代表一起到达维也纳。德国人民面对着军国主义复活的危险，和遭受着分裂的痛苦，使得这位高龄的老政治家也不得不出来奔走呼吁。他认为德国问题的解决有助于缓和国际形势。德国代表团里还有德意志民主共和国人民议会的议长、德意志民主共和国基督教民主联盟总书记戈丁、西德的议员达勒姆。
    美国人民受到华盛顿当局的阻挠不可能派遣他们最有名的和平战士来参加大会，可是还来了二十七个代表。团长之一是乔治·海华德，他是美国劳联旧金山分会的工会工作者。美国代表团里有十七位妇女，这反映了美国的和平运动的一个特点，那就是，妇女在和平运动里特别活跃。
    同样的广泛性也表现在东方和拉丁美洲各国代表团的成分上。印度代表团里有国大党人、甘地主义者、共产党人、人民党人、工农党人和“全印前进同盟”的成员。日本代表团中有西园寺公望的孙子，他是日本的一位议员。印尼代表团的团长是印尼国会外交委员会的主席，哥伦比亚代表团里有社会党的总书记。
    殖民地人民的代表冲破重重困难赶来参加大会。尽管法国殖民当局将突尼斯十一个代表中的十个人加以监禁，或没收了他们的护照，但仍有一位代表来到了维也纳。这个代表在大会上的报告得到了全体与会者的同情，特别是法国代表的同情，此外，差不多非洲所有殖民地的人民都派出了他们的代表来参加大会，他们的民族独立的要求都得到大会的有力支持。出席这次大会的多数代表是从他们自己的切身利益出发来拥护和平反对战争的。阿根廷代表埃特罗维契是一个农民，他只是在三四个月以前才知道和平运动，阿根廷农民切身利益的受到威胁，使他出席这次大会。冰岛代表赫特马逊是一个学生物学的大学生，他说：在我们国家已经建立了许多外国军事基地，我们最大的要求是保护我们的土地和人民免于毁灭，因此我们要和平。
    有一个叫皮埃特列的法国上校参加了这次大会，他也是从没有参加过和平运动。他打过三次仗，受过伤；在战争中，他的亲戚死了八十四人，他的故乡科西嘉死了四万人，因此他要求大会使德国军国主义不再复活，消除新的世界大战的危险。
    运动家也是反对战争的，他们知道体育运动只是在和平时期才能得到发展。各国代表中有不少运动家，捷克斯洛伐克的世界长跑冠军查托皮克出席了大会，德国代表佩尔泽是一九二六年一千五百公尺长跑世界锦标的获得者，也参加了大会。
    还有许多人是以个人身分来参加大会的，例如法国的化学家泰特里，他是一个天主教徒。西德的代表赫贝尔勒是一位七十四岁的老画家，他曾经到过欧洲许多国家。他说第二次世界大战把我一生的许多精心作品都毁坏了，这就引起了我对和平与战争问题的关心。
    维也纳大会代表的广泛性，表明美国的侵略政策和战争政策威胁着各国人民的切身利益，威胁着各国的民族独立和国家安全，这种政策推行的结果，有把各国人民重新拖入另一次大战的严重危险。这就使得各国不同政治和宗教信仰、不同社会职业、不同肤色的人民都日益积极起来为和平而斗争。
    参加维也纳大会的代表的广泛性就是目前世界形势的这一特点的反映，正是因为这个缘故，如尼蒂在闭幕词中所说的：“几天来的共同工作与相互了解，使我们中间许多人变成朋友，互相友爱。”
    包括具有如此广泛代表性的人物的大会，经过充分的协商，终于差不多是全场一致地通过了明确的共同纲领——致五大国政府书和世界人民和平大会宣言，这确实是和平运动的巨大胜利。特别值得指出的是：大会决议中主张五大国立即进行协商缔结和平公约，这是美国政府长久以来一直拒绝的。大会决议中主张立即停止朝鲜战争，这是美国政府长久以来反对的。大会决议中指出了美军在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战，并要求立即停止这一罪恶的措施，这是美国政府一直抵赖的。大会决议中主张中华人民共和国在联合国中享有应得的地位，这是美国政府一直阻挠的。此外大会还对停止越南、马来亚战争问题、民族独立问题、德国问题、日本问题、奥国问题、普遍裁军问题、经济与文化交流等问题都提出了符合世界人民利益的解决原则。大会的两个文件毫无疑义将成为更广泛地动员和团结全世界人民为和平而斗争的有力武器，各国和平运动毫无疑义将有进一步的发展。
