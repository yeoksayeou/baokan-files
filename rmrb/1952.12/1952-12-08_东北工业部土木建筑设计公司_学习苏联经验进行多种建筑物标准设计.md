    Northeast Industrial Department Civil Engineering and Building Design Company
    Learning from Soviet Experience to Conduct Standard Design of Various Buildings
    The Civil Engineering and Building Design Company of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department is currently conducting standard designs for various buildings to meet the construction needs of various capital construction departments next year.
    Standard design is one of the important advanced experiences in Soviet capital construction design. The method is as follows: In the design process, based on national capital construction policies and guidelines, and according to actual needs, one or several drawings are designed for use by various construction departments. The benefits of implementing and adopting standard designs are: it can greatly save the design resources and drawing time of various departments, and improve construction efficiency and project quality. According to statistics, if all civil engineering and building design projects of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department were designed individually and separately, the civil engineering and building design personnel of the department could only undertake 40% of the tasks, while the implementation of standard design can complete all tasks. Because the construction department adopts this design drawing, it is convenient for factory construction and mass production of building components, which can save materials. According to the statistics of a certain construction company, the standard dormitory floor slab project saved more than 50,000 yuan per building this year.
    In the past, there was only one standard design for employee dormitories in the Northeast, and the quality was not very good. In order to meet the larger-scale capital construction next year, the standard designs carried out by the Civil Engineering and Building Design Company of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department this year include 14 types such as standard schools, office buildings, nurseries, canteens, and warehouses. The standard dormitory designed by the company this year also adopts a modular plan. According to this plan, it can be pieced together into thirteen different forms of buildings with two monomers (one is linear and the other is corner type) according to different situations, and each building is divided into two types: Chinese national form and Western classical form, totaling twenty-six types. In this way, it is more suitable for overall layout and beautifying the city.
    At present, the preliminary design of various standard designs of the company has been completed. Some are being approved by higher authorities, and some are undergoing technical design. It is expected that all design work can be completed before the construction next year.

    东北工业部土木建筑设计公司
    学习苏联经验进行多种建筑物标准设计
    东北人民政府工业部土木建筑设计公司，目前正在进行多种建筑物的标准设计，供应各基本建设部门明年建设的需要。
    标准设计是苏联基本建设设计方面的重要先进经验之一。它的方法是：在设计时，按国家基本建设政策、方针，根据实际需要，设计成一个或几个图样，供应各建设部门采用。实行和采用标准设计的好处是：可以大大节省各部门设计力量和画图时间，提高施工效率和工程质量。据统计，东北人民政府工业部所有土木建筑设计工程，如果分散地个别地进行设计，该部土木建筑设计人员只能担当百分之四十的任务，而实行标准设计即可完成全部任务。由于施工部门采用这种设计图纸，便于施工工厂化，大量生产建筑物部件，因而又可节省材料。据某工程公司统计，今年修建的标准宿舍的楼板工程，每栋节省人民币五万多元。
    过去东北只有标准职工宿舍一种设计，质量也不太好。为迎接明年更大规模的基本建设，今年，东北人民政府工业部土木建筑设计公司进行的标准设计，已有标准学校、办公楼、托儿所、食堂、仓库等十四种。该公司今年设计的标准宿舍，还采用了组合式方案，依据这种方案，可按不同情况用两种单体（一是直线式，一是转角式）拼凑成十三种不同形式的建筑物，而每种建筑物还分中国民族形式与西洋古典形式两种，计为二十六种。这样，便更适合总平面布置与美观都市的需要。
    现在，该公司各项标准设计的初步设计已经完成，有的上级机关正在批审，有的正在进行技术设计，预计明年施工前可完成全部设计工作。
