Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, replied to Mr. Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, regarding the full text of the resolution adopted by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 3rd, based on the Indian proposal, concerning the agenda item "Korea: Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea". The text of the cable is as follows:

Mr. Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly:

I have received your telegram of December 5, 1952, which forwarded the full text of the resolution adopted by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 3, 1952, based on the Indian proposal, regarding the agenda item "Korea: Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea". I am now authorized to make the following reply to you on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

1.  Following the illegal adoption of the shameful and slanderous resolution in January 1951, which slandered China as an aggressor, the United Nations General Assembly has now conducted discussions on the Korean question without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and has passed a resolution supporting the U.S. government's position of violating international conventions and forcibly detaining prisoners of war to facilitate its continued and expanded war in Korea. This action is clearly illegal and invalid, and the Chinese people firmly oppose it.

2.  The illegal resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly based on the Indian proposal, which centers on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, does not, as described in your telegram, deal with the issue of prisoner of war repatriation "in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, concerning the treatment of prisoners of war, the established principles and practices of international law, and the relevant provisions of the draft armistice agreement". On the contrary, it is entirely based on the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle", which the U.S. side has unreasonably insisted on since the Korean armistice negotiations entered the prisoner of war agenda on December 11, 1951, and which is recognized worldwide as violating the Geneva Convention and international law, i.e., the "principle" of essentially forcibly detaining prisoners of war. In essence, this illegal resolution, no matter how it claims to be in accordance with the Geneva Convention and international law, is actually a disguised version of the so-called "Twenty-One Nation Proposal" put forward by Mr. Acheson of the United States in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 24, 1952. Regarding this point, not only have official spokespersons from the U.S., Britain, and other countries repeatedly and publicly admitted and praised it as "forcefully and firmly establishing the principle of voluntary repatriation", not only do countries both supporting and opposing the Indian proposal within and outside the United Nations unanimously recognize that this proposal supports the "non-forcible repatriation principle" advocated by the U.S. government, but even Mr. Menon himself, the Indian representative to the United Nations and the original proposer of this illegal resolution, does not attempt to conceal it. Even you, Mr. Pearson, did you not frankly admit when reporting to the Canadian House of Commons on December 8 on the progress of the United Nations General Assembly session that the "non-forcible repatriation principle" proposed by the U.S. side remains the only basis for the United Nations side in the Korean armistice negotiations?

    Such an illegal resolution based on the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle" can never resolve the "only remaining unresolved issue in the armistice negotiations process, namely the principles and procedures for prisoner of war repatriation" mentioned in your telegram. In fact, regarding this remaining issue, the two sides in the Korean armistice negotiations have already formulated specific and meticulous methods and steps in Article 3 of the draft armistice agreement, which has already been agreed upon, based on the principle of repatriation of all prisoners of war in accordance with international practice and the Geneva Convention. This Article 3 is not only a condition for ending the Korean War that both sides can accept, as stated in your telegram, but also a condition for ending the Korean War that both sides have already accepted. If the U.S. side acted in accordance with the draft armistice agreement and did not deliberately create a so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle" as an excuse to obstruct the Korean armistice, then this "only remaining unresolved issue" could have been resolved satisfactorily long ago, and the Korean War, which is of common concern to people all over the world, could have ended long ago. People all over the world know that today it is the U.S. government that insists on the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle," which is actually the "principle" of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, violating the provisions of the Geneva Convention, violating the provisions of the Korean armistice agreement draft, and suspending the Korean armistice negotiations, thus making the prisoner of war repatriation issue impossible to resolve for a long time. And the United Nations General Assembly is actually supporting this illegal crime of the United States, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China resolutely abides by and upholds the fundamental principle of the Geneva Convention of repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice takes effect, and will continue to resolutely abide by and uphold this principle.

3.  The illegal resolution you forwarded is not only based on the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle," but also presupposes that some prisoners of war among those captured by the Korean and Chinese sides do indeed "refuse to go home" to reunite with their families and live a peaceful life. Such a view is not only completely inhumane but also absolutely contrary to the facts.

    The fact is: For a long time, the U.S. side has brazenly disregarded the provisions of Article 17 of the Geneva Convention and other clauses on the humane treatment of prisoners of war. In the prisoner of war camps under its management, it has used a large number of American, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek agents to serve as responsible personnel in the prisoner of war camps. It has even used Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek agents to impersonate Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, mixing them among the prisoners of war, and frequently using extremely barbaric and inhumane methods such as torture, massacres, and collective starvation to conduct so-called "persuasion," "screening," "re-screening," and "solicitation" of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, coercing them to express "refusal to be repatriated" and "unwillingness to return home." Prisoners of war who were unwilling to do so were brutally beaten by these agents, and after the prisoners of war were seriously injured and lost consciousness, the agents would use this opportunity to tattoo them with words that insulted their personality and violated their will to betray their motherland, or hold down the prisoners of war's fingers and use the blood from their wounds to make fingerprints on so-called "screening" documents of "unwillingness to return home"; these agents even dipped their own fingers in the blood of the beaten prisoners of war's wounds to forge fingerprints. All of this has been completely confirmed as true in the various reports of the U.S. and British news agencies over the past year, in the public opinion of India, Canada, Britain, and other countries participating in the U.S. side's war, in the self-confessions of former U.S. prisoner of war camp commanders Brigadier General Colson and Brigadier General Dodd, in the reports of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were fortunate enough to escape the "death camps," in the reports of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and even in the recent remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett to reporters on December 2.

    The U.S. side, having exhausted all conscience, uses these brands and blood letters they created with their own hands as a basis to clamor that "some Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are unwilling to be repatriated," and the illegal resolution you forwarded actually affirms this, saying that "the Geneva Convention cannot be interpreted as authorizing the detaining power to use force to compel individual prisoners of war to return home." In fact, all prisoners of war are enemy combatants who are forcibly disposed of under the enemy's military control and have no freedom. Once the armistice takes effect, the right to release and repatriation enjoyed by all prisoners of war on both sides is to lift the enemy's military control, return them to the other side, and enable them to regain freedom and return home to live a peaceful life. What is there to say about "forcible repatriation" or "using force to compel them to return home" when prisoners of war enjoy this right? The sophistry that "the detaining power cannot use force to compel individual prisoners of war to return home" is completely untenable and cannot be found in any basis in the Geneva Convention. On the contrary, many provisions of the Geneva Convention stipulate that the detaining power is only responsible for the prompt release and repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice takes effect and has no right to use force or use agents to insult and detain prisoners of war. Obviously, the purpose of the United Nations General Assembly in passing this illegal resolution is to divert the world's people's anger and attention towards the terrible crimes committed by the U.S. side in "screening" prisoners of war to the issue of so-called "forcing prisoners of war to return home" or "not using force to force prisoners of war to return home." This is truly "a challenge to the basic human nature shared by mankind."

    During the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were still being massacred for resisting "screening," "persuasion," and opposing the expression of "unwillingness to return home." From October 14 to December 4 of this year, according to the news revealed by U.S. and British news agencies, as many as 321 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were killed or injured in this way, averaging six or seven Korean and Chinese prisoners of war injured every day. But when you passed this illegal resolution at the United Nations General Assembly, you pretended to be compassionate and altruistic, talking about "humanitarian principles" and "free will of prisoners of war" to defend the brutal crimes of the U.S. side, and you tried your best to realize the U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" or "non-forcible repatriation principle," which is actually the "principle" of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Fair-minded people around the world cannot help but feel astonished and indignant at such a degenerate act by the United Nations General Assembly.

4.  The illegal resolution you forwarded stipulates that tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war should be "released" in a demilitarized zone and handed over to a repatriation committee composed of neutral countries. Those who "voluntarily return home" are allowed to go home, and those who "are unwilling to return home" are handed over to the repatriation committee, and after 120 days, they are handed over to the United Nations for handling. The repatriation committee also has to set up an arbitrator. If the committee cannot reach an agreement on the appointment of this arbitrator, then this matter should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. The arbitrator plays a decisive role in the repatriation committee, and the final power of appointment belongs to the United Nations, and the final power to deal with the so-called "prisoners of war who are unwilling to return home" is also handed over to the United Nations. This is truly an extremely absurd suggestion. Have the representatives of the countries that proposed and passed this illegal resolution in the United Nations forgotten that the United Nations is one of the belligerent parties in the Korean War?

    To be honest, these regulations go around in many circles and play many tricks, but in fact, they completely adopt the three suggestions put forward by the U.S. side in Panmunjom on September 28, 1952, and write them in a more skillful form. The purpose is nothing more than to deceive the people of the world more easily, so that the U.S. government's conspiracy to violate international conventions and forcibly detain prisoners of war can be realized.

    The slander that prisoners of war "are unwilling to return home" is completely unbelievable, as mentioned above. Moreover, handing over the task of repatriating all prisoners of war home to a repatriation committee composed of neutral countries cannot solve the problem, because, as mentioned earlier, the U.S. side has sent a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek agents to impersonate Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, mixing them among Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and using the psychological abnormalities such as shame and concern caused by the fact that prisoners of war have been forcibly tattooed with words of betraying their motherland or stamped with bloody fingerprints of refusing to be repatriated, they frequently coerce them. If these agents are not separated or isolated from the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, then all visits and explanations cannot be carried out smoothly, and those Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have been tattooed and fingerprinted may still be coerced by the agents to refuse to return home and even be taken away. Therefore, it is fundamentally impossible to separate or isolate agents from Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the circumstances of the repatriation committee managing prisoners of war. Only by directly handing over the prisoners of war to the other party for protection can this be done. The method proposed by General Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in their letter to General Clark of the United States on October 16, 1952, of sending all prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone and directly handing them over to the other party for reception, and then implementing visits and explanations before repatriation, takes into account the above-mentioned complicated circumstances, so that prisoners of war can first break away from the other party's military control and be protected by their own side, and then it can be guaranteed that prisoners of war can be fully repatriated in accordance with humanitarian principles, international practice, the Geneva Convention, and the draft Korean armistice agreement. If the United Nations General Assembly is not a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, there is no reason not to accept this reasonable and reasonable proposal for prisoner of war repatriation from the Korean and Chinese sides.

5.  Based on the above, people can clearly see that the illegal resolution you forwarded is neither fair nor reasonable. It is unreasonable because it completely violates human conscience, humanitarian principles, international practice, the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and the provisions of the draft Korean armistice agreement, and it recognizes the "wishes" of prisoners of war "refusing to be repatriated" created by the U.S. side using extremely barbaric and brutal methods, and it insists on detaining tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war as hostages to force the Korean and Chinese sides to yield to the U.S. side. It is unfair because it deliberately wants to impose the "voluntary repatriation principle" insisted on by the U.S. side, which has no legal basis, on the Korean and Chinese sides, and it unreasonably rejects the Korean and Chinese sides' proposal to abide by the Geneva Convention and repatriate all prisoners of war and the Soviet delegation's proposal to first achieve a comprehensive ceasefire in Korea immediately and then resolve the issue of repatriating all prisoners of war.

    Since the facts are like this, I cannot but solemnly inform you that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that such an illegal resolution is fundamentally impossible to be "a fair and reasonable basis for an agreement."

    The Central People's Government believes that the attitude of the Korean and Chinese sides in adhering to the principle of complete repatriation in accordance with humanitarian principles and the Geneva Convention on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is completely correct, just, and fair and reasonable. The settlement of the prisoner of war issue in the Korean negotiations must and can only be based on the Geneva Convention, and absolutely cannot and must not be based on any illegal principles. On the basis of the principles of the Geneva Convention, the Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly stated that once the Korean armistice takes effect, both sides should immediately, unconditionally, quickly, and completely repatriate prisoners of war, and the Korean and Chinese sides are prepared to receive joint Red Cross groups from both sides to visit the prisoner of war camps, so that the other side's prisoners of war can return home quickly. From this, it can be seen that the Korean and Chinese sides are indeed, as stated in your telegram, willing to make every possible effort to ensure that all prisoners of war return home and assist them in returning home quickly. However, if the unfair and unreasonable illegal resolution you forwarded is accepted, then it cannot guarantee that all prisoners of war will return home quickly, and it is tantamount to surrendering to the violence of the U.S. side in destroying humanity and destroying the human rights of prisoners of war, and therefore it is absolutely impossible to lead to and realize a real ceasefire. Moreover, if the U.S. government's "voluntary repatriation principle" embodied in the illegal resolution you forwarded is allowed to be realized, and if the international law principles of maintaining international order and the human rights of prisoners of war are allowed to be wantonly destroyed by the U.S. government, then the suffering suffered by Korean and Chinese prisoners of war today may fall on the heads of people from other countries who may become prisoners of war tomorrow; the disaster of aggression suffered by Korea and China today may fall on the heads of any other country in the world tomorrow.

6.  Your telegram uses many words to try to explain that the illegal resolution you passed, which is clothed in Indian clothes and centered on the U.S. "voluntary repatriation principle," is a sincere desire for the rapid end of the Korean War. However, the illegal resolution you forwarded completely proves that it is yielding to the U.S. government's determination to use violence to implement its tyrannical will to forcibly detain prisoners of war in order to suspend and disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations and prolong and expand the Korean War. You are not trying to find ways to end the Korean War, but are trying to induce and coerce some countries attending the United Nations General Assembly to jointly approve the U.S. policy of not stopping the war, not negotiating, and not peacefully resolving the prolongation and expansion of the Korean War, while at the same time trying to shift the responsibility for not being able to stop the war to the Korean and Chinese sides. It can be asserted that your attempt to shift responsibility is futile.

    If the United Nations General Assembly truly has a "unanimous desire to bring peace to Korea," as stated in your telegram, then the United Nations General Assembly should adhere to the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention and international law, and solemnly demand that the U.S. side immediately resume the Panmunjom negotiations, and according to the proposal put forward by Soviet representative Vyshinsky on November 10 and 24 to peacefully resolve the Korean question, first, in accordance with the draft Korean armistice agreement that has already been agreed upon by both sides, realize a complete ceasefire between the belligerent parties, and then hand over the issue of repatriating all prisoners of war together with the peaceful resolution of the Korean question to the "Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question" composed of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's of Korea, and South Korea. This committee is of the same nature as the political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the draft Korean armistice agreement mentioned in your telegram, and its composition is the fairest and most reasonable. If this method is implemented, the Korean armistice can be realized immediately, and the disasters of the Korean people and the casualties of soldiers on both sides can be stopped. In this way, the United Nations General Assembly can truly and quickly "bring peace to Korea."

    However, the current session of the United Nations has already rejected this fair, reasonable, and truly peace-promoting proposal. I am now submitting it to you again: In order to realize the urgent peace aspirations of the people of the world, in order to express the sincerity of the Chinese people in eagerly hoping for the early restoration of peace in Korea, and in order not to allow the prisoner of war issue to become an obstacle and excuse for realizing the Korean armistice, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China requests the United Nations General Assembly to cancel the illegal resolution you forwarded, to order the U.S. government to immediately resume the Panmunjom negotiations, and to first implement a comprehensive ceasefire according to the draft Korean armistice agreement, and then hand over the issue of repatriating all prisoners of war to the above-mentioned "Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question" for resolution. If the United Nations General Assembly agrees to discuss this request, then representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea must participate in the discussion. If the United Nations General Assembly refuses this just request and continues to adhere to its illegal resolution aimed at supporting the U.S. government's violation of international conventions and forcibly detaining prisoners of war, then it will further prove that your purpose is definitely not to achieve peace in Korea and the Far East, but is thoroughly to continue and expand the Korean War in order to further undermine peace in the Far East and the world in the future, and thus further exposes the United Nations as increasingly becoming a tool of the U.S. ruling clique in preparing for war and expanding aggression. All those who support the war policy of the U.S. ruling clique must bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this action.

7.  I request that the full text of this reply be distributed at the United Nations General Assembly.

8.  Please accept my highest respect.

    周恩来外长电复联合国大会主席
    反对联大根据印度提案通过的朝鲜问题的决议案
    重申我国政府关于和平解决朝鲜问题的正义要求
    【新华社十四日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来就联合国大会主席皮尔逊转来联合国第七届大会根据印度提案所通过的关于“朝鲜：联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会报告”的议程的决议案全文一事，复电联合国大会主席皮尔逊。电文如下：联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生：
    我已收到了你一九五二年十二月五日的来电，其中转来了联合国第七届大会在一九五二年十二月三日根据印度提案所通过的关于“朝鲜：联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会报告”的议程的决议案全文。我现在受权代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府对你作如下的答复。
    一、联合国大会继一九五一年一月非法通过了诬蔑中国为侵略者的可耻的诽谤决议之后，现在它又在没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加的情况之下，进行了关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并通过了一个支持美国政府违反国际公约、强迫扣留战俘的立场以利其继续和扩大朝鲜现行战争的决议案，这一行动显然是非法的，无效的，中国人民坚决表示反对。
    二、联合国大会根据印度提案所通过的这个以战俘遣返问题为其中心内容的非法决议案，并不是像你来电中所描绘的那样“按照一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约的条文、国际公法中确立的原则与惯例、以及停战协定草案中有关的规定”来处理战俘遣返的问题的；不，恰恰相反，它是完全以美国方面自一九五一年十二月十一日朝鲜停战谈判进入战俘议程以迄于今所一直无理坚持的、被全世界公认为违背日内瓦公约和国际公法的所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”，亦即实质上强迫扣留战俘的“原则”为其基础的。揭穿了说，这个非法决议案，无论它怎样自称是符合于日内瓦公约和国际公法，实际上，它却是一九五二年十月二十四日美国艾奇逊先生在联合国大会第一委员会提出的所谓“二十一国提案”的改装。关于这一点，不仅美英等国的官方发言人曾经多次公开承认并赞许其为“有力地、坚决地确定了自愿遣返的原则”，不仅联合国内外不论赞成或反对印度提案的国家都一致认定这个提案是支持美国政府所主张的“不强迫遣返原则”的，甚至就是印度出席联合国代表、这个非法决议案的原提案人梅农先生本人也并不企图隐讳。连你，皮尔逊先生，在十二月八日对加拿大下院报告联合国大会开会进程时不也是坦白承认：美国方面所提的“不强迫遣返原则”仍是联合国方面在朝鲜停战谈判中的唯一基础么？
    像这样一个以所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”为基础的非法决议案，决不可能解决你来电中所说的“停战谈判过程中唯一尚未解决的剩余问题，即遣俘原则与程序问题”。事实上，关于这一剩余问题，朝鲜停战谈判双方在已经达成协议的停战协定草案第三条中，业已根据国际惯例和日内瓦公约的遣返全部战俘的原则，制订了具体而缜密的办法和步骤。这个第三条，不仅是你来电中所说双方都能接受的结束朝鲜战争的条件，而且是双方都已经接受了的结束朝鲜战争的条件。如果美国方面按照停战协定草案办事，而不故意制造出一个所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”来作为阻挠朝鲜停战的藉口，那么，这个“唯一尚未解决的剩余问题”早就可以圆满解决，全世界人民所共同关心的朝鲜战争早就可以结束了。全世界人民都知道，今天是美国政府坚持所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”实即强迫扣留战俘的“原则”，破坏了日内瓦公约的条文，破坏了朝鲜停战协定草案的规定，中止了朝鲜停战谈判，因而使战俘遣返问题长期不能解决。而联合国大会竟对美国这种违法罪行加以支持，这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府坚决地遵守和维护在停战生效后遣返全部战俘的日内瓦公约的根本原则，并将继续坚决地遵守和维护这一原则。
    三、你所交来的这个非法决议案，不仅是以所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”为根据的，而且是以假定朝中方面被俘人员中确有一些战俘“拒绝回家”与其家人团聚过和平生活为前提的。这样的看法既完全不合乎人道，更绝对不合乎事实。
    事实是：很长时期以来，美国方面就悍然不顾日内瓦公约第十七条的规定及其他对战俘人道待遇的条款，在其所管理的战俘营中，使用了大批美国的、李承晚的和蒋介石的特务担任战俘营中的负责职务，甚至使用了李承晚的和蒋介石的特务冒充朝中战俘，混杂在战俘当中，经常用酷刑、屠杀和集体罚饿等等极端野蛮、极无人道的办法，来对朝中战俘进行所谓“劝导”、“甄别”、“再甄别”和“征询”，胁迫他们表示“拒绝遣返”和“不愿回家”。凡是不愿意这样做的战俘都遭到这些特务的毒打，而在战俘们受重伤、失知觉之后，特务们就利用这一时机来在战俘身上刺上侮辱他们人格、违反他们意志的背叛祖国的字样，或按住战俘的手指，用他们伤口上的血，在所谓“不愿回家”的“甄别”书上打指印；这些特务甚至用自己的手指蘸上被毒打的战俘伤口上的血，来伪造指印。这一切，在一年多来美英通讯社的各种报道中，在印度、加拿大、英国和其他参加美国一方作战的国家的舆论中，在美国前战俘营长官柯尔生准将和杜德准将的自承中，在侥幸逃出“死亡营”的朝中战俘的报告中，在红十字国际委员会的报告中，甚至在美国国防部部长罗维特最近在十二月二日对记者的谈话中都已经完全证实其为千真万确了。
    美国方面丧尽天良地拿这些他们亲手制造出来的烙印和血书作为根据，来叫嚣什么“有些朝中战俘不愿遣返”，而你所交来的这个非法决议案就居然加以肯定，说什么“日内瓦公约不能被解释为授权拘留国以武力来强使个别战俘回返家乡”。其实，凡属战俘，就是在敌方武力控制之下被强迫处置而不得自由的对方交战人员，一旦停战生效，双方全部战俘所应享受的释放与遣返的权利，就是要解除敌方的武力控制，使之归还对方，得以恢复自由和回家过和平生活。战俘享受这种权利，有何
    “强迫遣返”或“武力强使回乡”之可言？所谓
    “拘留国不能以武力强使个别战俘回返家乡”的诡辩是根本不能成立的，在日内瓦公约中是找不到任何根据的。相反地，日内瓦公约的许多条文都确定了拘留国在停战生效后只有责任迅速释放与遣返全部战俘，而决没有权利使用武力、使用特务来侮辱和扣留战俘。很显然，联合国大会通过这个非法决议案的目的是想把世界人民对于美国方面在“甄别”战俘时所犯的恐怖罪行的愤怒和注意，转移到所谓“强迫战俘回家”或“不以武力强使战俘回家”的问题上去。你们这种做法，才真“是对于人类所共有的基本人道本性的一个挑战”。
    就在联合国第七届大会期间，朝中战俘们还在因抗拒“甄别”、“劝导”和反对表示“不愿回家”的愿望，而继续受着屠杀。从今年十月十四日到十二月四日，仅仅根据美英通讯社所透露出来的消息加以统计，这样死伤的朝中战俘已达三百二十一人之多，平均每天有六、七个朝中战俘因此受害。而你们在联合国大会上通过这个非法决议案时，却俨然无事地装出一副仿佛正在悲天悯人的样子，侈谈什么“人道原则”和“战俘自由意志”来替美国方面的残暴罪行辩护，并想尽了种种方法，来实现美国方面的所谓“自愿遣返原则”或“不强迫遣返原则”，实即强迫扣留战俘的“原则”。全世界公正人士对于联合国大会这样堕落的行为，不能不感到惊讶和愤慨。
    四、你所交来的这个非法决议案，规定将十几万朝中战俘送到一个非军事区“释放”出来，交给一个由中立国组成的遣返委员会，准许“自愿回家”者回家，其“不愿回家”者交给遣返委员会，在一百二十天后交给联合国处理。这个遣返委员会并要设立一个公断人，假如委员会对于这个公断人的任命不能达成协议，则此事应该提交联合国大会。公断人是在遣返委员会起决定作用的，其最后任命权归于联合国，而所谓“不愿回家”的战俘的最后处理权也交给联合国，这真是荒唐达于极点的建议。难道联合国中提出并通过这个非法决议案的各国代表们竟然忘记了联合国正是朝鲜战争交战双方中的一方么？
    老实说，这些规定兜了许多圈子，玩了许多花样，实际上是完全采纳了美国方面一九五二年九月二十八日在板门店所提的三种建议而以更巧妙的形式写出来的，其目的无非是为了更易于欺骗世界人民，使美国政府违反国际公约，强迫扣留战俘的阴谋得以实现。
    所谓战俘“不愿回家”的谰言，完全是不可置信的，已如上述。而且就将遣返全部战俘回家这个任务交给中立国所组成的遣返委员会去做，也是不能解决问题的，因为，如前所说，美国方面曾派有大批李承晚和蒋介石的特务冒充朝中战俘，混杂在朝中战俘当中，利用战俘已被强迫刺上背叛祖国字样或盖上拒绝遣返血书指印后所产生的耻辱、顾虑等心理失常的状态，经常对他们进行胁迫行为，如果不把这些特务从朝中战俘中隔开或孤立起来，那么，一切访问和解释都不可能顺利进行，而那些被刺过字和打过血指印的朝中战俘们仍有被特务胁迫拒绝回家以至带走的可能。因此，要从朝中战俘中隔开或孤立特务分子，这在遣返委员会管理战俘的情况之下，是根本无法办到的，只有将战俘直接交给对方保护，然后才能办到。朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在其一九五二年十月十六日致美国克拉克将军函中所提出的将全部战俘送至非军事区直接交给对方接收，并实行访问和解释然后遣返的办法，就是照顾到上述这些复杂情况，使战俘能首先从对方的武力控制下脱离出来，而受到自方的保护，然后才能保证战俘得以按照人道原则、国际惯例、日内瓦公约及朝鲜停战协定草案，获得全部遣返。联合国大会如果不是美国政府的传声筒，就没有任何理由不接受朝中方面这个合情合理的遣俘建议。
    五、基于以上所述，人们可以清楚地看到，你所交来的这个非法决议案是既不公平，也不合理的。它之所以不合理，是因为它完全违反了人类的良知、人道的原则、国际的惯例、日内瓦公约的条文和朝鲜停战协定草案的规定，承认了美国方面用极端野蛮残暴的方法所制造出来的战俘“拒绝遣返”的“愿望”，并硬要扣留几万朝中战俘作为人质来迫使朝中方面对美国方面屈服。它之所以不公平，是因为它处心积虑地想把美国方面所坚持的毫无法理根据的“自愿遣返原则”强加在朝中方面头上，而毫无理由地拒绝了朝中方面关于遵守日内瓦公约遣返全部战俘的建议和苏联代表团关于先在朝鲜立即全面停战然后再解决遣返全部战俘问题的提案。
    事实既是这样，所以我不能不郑重地通知你，中华人民共和国中央人民政府对于这样一个非法决议案，认为是根本不可能“作为一个协议的公正与合理的基础”的。
    中央人民政府认为，朝中方面在战俘遣返问题上坚持符合人道原则和日内瓦公约的全部遣返原则的态度，是完全正确的，正义的，也是公正的，合理的。朝鲜谈判中遣俘问题的解决，必须也只能以日内瓦公约为基础，而绝对不能也不许以任何非法的原则为基础。在日内瓦公约的原则基础之上，朝中方面曾经一再表示，一旦朝鲜停战生效，双方应立即无条件地、迅速地、全部地遣返战俘，朝中方面并准备了接待双方联合红十字会小组去访问战俘营，以利对方战俘得以迅速回家。由此可见，朝中方面的确是如同你来电中所说的，愿尽一切可能的努力以保证全部战俘回家并协助他们迅速回家的。但是，如果接受了你所交来的这个既不公正也不合理的非法决议案，那就不能保证全部战俘迅速回家，那就等于向美国方面灭绝人道、摧毁战俘人权的暴力屈服，因而绝不可能引致并实现一个真正的停火。并且，你所交来的这个非法决议案中所体现的美国政府的“自愿遣返原则”如果任其实现，维护国际秩序和战俘人权的国际法原则如果任其为美国政府所横暴破坏，那么，今天朝中战俘所受的苦难，明天就可能落在其他国家可能成为战俘的人们的头上；今天朝中两国所受的侵略的灾祸，明天就可能落在全世界任何一个其他国家的头上。
    六、你的来电用了许多辞藻来企图说明你们通过这个穿上印度外衣的、以美国“自愿遣返原则”为其中心内容的非法决议案，是热诚愿望朝鲜战争的迅速结束的，可是，你所交来的这个非法决议案却完完全全证明它是在曲从美国政府决心用暴力来贯彻他们强迫扣留战俘以便中止和破坏朝鲜停战谈判、延长和扩大朝鲜战争的横暴意志。你们不是在努力设法结束朝鲜战争，而是在努力设法诱胁出席联合国大会的若干国家共同批准美国的不停战、不谈判、也不和平解决的延长并扩大朝鲜战争的政策，同时则又企图把战争不能停止的责任，设法转嫁到朝中方面。可以断言，你们这种转嫁责任的企图是徒然的。
    假如联合国大会真是如同你来电中所说的那样，具有“为朝鲜带来和平的一致愿望”，那么，联合国大会就应该坚持日内瓦公约和国际公法的战俘全部遣返原则，严正地要求美国方面立即恢复板门店谈判，并根据苏联代表维辛斯基先生十一月十日和二十四日所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，首先依照双方业已获得协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，实现交战双方的完全停火，而将战俘全部遣返问题与和平解决朝鲜问题一起交由美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜所组成的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决。这个委员会与你来电中所提及的朝鲜停战协定草案第六十款所规定的政治会议，是同一性质的，而其组成的成分又是最为公平，最为合理的。这种办法如果实行，朝鲜停战就可立即实现，朝鲜人民的灾难，双方士兵的伤亡，就可停止。这样，联合国大会就可以真正迅速地“为朝鲜带来和平”。
    然而，对于这一公平合理而又真能促进和平的建议，联合国本届大会已经加以拒绝了。我现在再一次向你提出：为了实现全世界人民迫切的和平愿望，为了表示中国人民切盼朝鲜和平早日恢复的诚意，而不使遣俘问题成为实现朝鲜停战的障碍和藉口，中华人民共和国中央人民政府要求联合国大会取消你所交来的这个非法决议案，责成美国政府立即恢复板门店谈判，并根据朝鲜停战协定草案首先实行全面停战然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交由上述的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决。如果联合国大会同意讨论这一要求，则在讨论时必须有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加。如果联合国大会竟拒绝这一正义要求，而仍然坚持其旨在支持美国政府违反国际公约、强迫扣留战俘的非法决议案，那就更进一步地证明你们的目的绝不是为了获致朝鲜和远东的和平，而是彻头彻尾地为了要继续和扩大朝鲜战争以便将来更进一步破坏远东和世界的和平，因而也就更加暴露了联合国正日益成为美国统治集团准备战争和扩大侵略的御用工具。一切支持美国统治集团战争政策的人，必须要对这种行动的后果负起严重的责任。
    七、我要求你将这个复文的全文在联合国大会上散发。
    八、请接受我最高的敬意。
