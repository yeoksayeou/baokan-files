Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement endorsing the "Notice on the Revision of the Tax System" by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The full text is as follows:

    On behalf of industrialists and businessmen nationwide, we warmly welcome and endorse the "Notice on the Revision of the Tax System" promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. This is fully in line with the current political tasks and economic construction requirements of the country and fully conforms to the policy of "simplifying the tax system" and "implementing reasonable burden" stipulated in the Common Program.
    The trial implementation of the commodity circulation tax is a significant advancement in China's taxation system. This not only guarantees state revenue but also scientifically simplifies the tax system and urges public and private enterprises to implement economic accounting systems more quickly. Further improvements in the collection of income tax and democratic appraisal work will be welcomed and encouraged by private industrialists and businessmen. We believe that this revision of the tax system is a great achievement of the motherland's three years of economic recovery, transformation, and development. Not long ago, the People's Government carried out a nationwide commercial adjustment and now has revised the tax system, enabling public and private enterprises to fairly and reasonably share the state's tax burden. This is extremely beneficial to the operation of industry and commerce and also extremely powerfully promotes the development of the entire social economy. Ironclad facts prove that private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, will continuously receive assistance and care from the state and develop forward.
    We should immediately, according to the spirit and principles of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding the revision of the tax system, call on and mobilize organizations of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels across the country to conduct extensive publicity and education in industrial and commercial circles. At the same time, we must fully launch in-depth study, so that industrial and commercial circles deeply understand the great significance of this tax system revision, give full play to their enthusiasm for business operations, and enthusiastically and honestly undertake the task of paying taxes, and strive to implement the tax system.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held an interim expanded meeting of the Standing Committee from December 16th to 20th to discuss guaranteeing tax revenue and simplifying the tax system, with the intention of providing the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government with reference for revising the tax system. The Standing Committee members present were: Zhang Naiqi, Xu Dixin, Rong Yiren, Fu Huating, Hu Zi'ang, Li Zheren, Le Songsheng, Zhou Shutao, Liu Peizhi, Ye Yutian, Xiang Shuxiang, Miao Hainan, Hua Yuqing, Xiang De, Qian Jiaju, Sha Qianli; Preparatory Committee members: Wang Jiqing, Zhu Jisheng, Ling Qijun, Hu Ziying, Wang Xingyao, Jing Shuping, and more than 20 industrial and commercial figures familiar with taxation from various regions. Representatives from the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, the General Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction attended the meeting as observers.
    The meeting broadly discussed various issues related to revising the tax system and simplifying tax payment procedures, put forward opinions and suggestions, and finally resolved to provide them to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for reference and adoption. It also resolved to mobilize industrial and commercial circles to conduct extensive study after the revised tax system is announced and to strive to implement the national tax system. After the tax system issue was discussed, Sha Qianli, Secretary of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, gave a work report on the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's two months of work.

    全国工商联筹委会拥护修正税制
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会拥护中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于税制修正通告的声明。原文如下：
    我们代表全国工商业者，热烈的欢迎与拥护中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布的税制修正的通告。这是完全符合于国家当前的政治任务与经济建设的要求的，完全符合于共同纲领所规定的“简化税制”“实行合理负担”的政策的。
    商品流通税的试行，是我国税收制度上一个巨大的进步。这不但保证了国家的税收，不但科学地简化了税制，而且督促公私企业更快地实行经济核算制。关于所得税的征收与民主评议工作进一步的改善，这更将获得私营工商业者欢欣与鼓舞。我们认为这次税制的修正，是祖国三年来经济的恢复、改造与发展的伟大成果。不久以前，人民政府进行了全国性的商业调整，现在又修正了税制，使公私企业公平合理地共同负担国家的税收，这是极端有利于工商业的经营，同时也是极端有力地促进整个社会经济的发展的。铁一般的事实证明着：有利于国计民生的私营企业，在国营经济领导之下，是会不断的从国家获得扶助与照顾而向前发展的。
    我们当立即根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会对于税制修正的精神与原则，号召和动员全国各地各级工商联的组织，在工商界中，进行广泛的宣传与教育，同时，全面展开深入的学习，使工商界深切体会这次税制修正的重大意义，发挥其经营积极性，踊跃的诚实的负担起缴纳税款的任务，为贯彻执行税制而努力。
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会为讨论保证税收简化税制以供中央人民政府财政部修正税制参考起见，曾于十二月十六日到二十日举行了常务委员会临时扩大会议。出席的常务委员有：章乃器、许涤新、荣毅仁、傅华亭、胡子昂、李哲人、乐松生、周叔弢、刘珮芝、叶雨田、项叔翔、苗海南、华煜卿、向德、千家驹、沙千里；筹备委员有：王际清、朱继圣、凌其峻、胡子婴、王性尧、经叔平及各地熟悉税务的工商界人士二十余人。列席会议的有：中共中央统一战线工作部、中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会工商行政管理局、中央人民政府财政部、财政部税务总局、中国民主建国会总会等单位的代表。
