All council members are veteran journalists and old friends, and are extremely enthusiastic about journalism. I am deeply aware of my lack of ability in being elected by you to serve as president, and I hope that all council members will strengthen guidance and work together to further develop this non-governmental news organization, in accordance with the original intention of its establishment. Subsequently, the council members in charge of various specific businesses reported on the work situation of the past two months and plans for improving business. The meeting enthusiastically discussed business development issues and reached a consensus.
