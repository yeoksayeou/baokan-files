The mass-based, large-scale winter farmland irrigation construction campaign in the South Central region has begun. A new development in the South Central region's farmland irrigation efforts is the widespread construction of small reservoirs in mountainous areas and the establishment of pumping stations in areas with convenient access to rivers and lakes for irrigation.

Currently, construction on some farmland irrigation projects in the South Central region has already begun, while most are rushing to finalize construction plans, gather construction materials, and mobilize and organize laborers. In the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Guangdong Province, a reservoir demonstration project was completed in October, and a full-scale reservoir construction campaign was launched in November. Hubei Province, with the largest scale of the winter construction campaign, has basically completed key pilot projects in various locations and is now moving towards a full-scale rollout. The Shuijitang Reservoir in Xupu County, the Baogai River Reservoir in Liuyang County, and the Wulongbei Dam in Hunan Province all commenced construction at the end of November. Winter construction projects in Guangxi (focused on building mountain ponds and reservoirs), Henan (focused on digging wells and installing waterwheels), and Jiangxi (focused on building reservoirs) provinces have also commenced construction one after another. In the upper reaches of the Lishui, Weishui, 渌水, and 涔水 rivers in Hunan Province, the upper reaches of the Zhashui River in Jiangxi Province, and six soil and water conservation experimental areas including Wuhua County in Guangdong Province, construction has begun on all but the soil and water conservation experimental area in the upper reaches of the 涔水 River in Hunan Province, which is still under survey. Many pumping stations have purchased machinery and are preparing for installation. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    中南开展农田水利冬修运动
    中南区群众性的大规模的农田水利工程冬修运动已初步展开。在山区普遍修建小型水库和在江湖灌溉便利地区建立抽水机站，是中南区农田水利事业的新发展。
    现在，中南区农田水利工程一部分已经动工，大部分正在赶订施工计划，筹集施工器材，动员和组织民工。广东省海南黎族、苗族自治区十月份就完成水库示范工程，十一月份已全面展开兴修水库运动。冬修运动规模最大的湖北省，已基本完成各地的重点试验工程，现正向全面展开中。湖南省溆浦县水积塘水库、浏阳县宝盖河水库和乌龙陂大坝，都已在十一月底开工。广西（以兴修山塘、水库为主）、河南（以挖井和安装水车为主）和江西（以兴修水库为主）三省冬修工程也已先后开始动工。湖南省澧水、沩水、?水、涔水等河上游，江西省渣水上游和广东省五华县等六个水土保持实验区，除湖南省涔水上游水土保持实验区正在进行勘察外，其他五个实验区的工程都已动工。许多抽水机站已买好机器，准备安装。    （据新华社讯）
