    January in the Capital
    Yu Zhanlin, Secretary-General of the Northwest Nationalities National Day Observation Delegation
    We, the Northwest Nationalities National Day Observation Delegation, were honored to come to the capital, Beijing. We are staying in a well-equipped guest house. The Central Nationalities Affairs Commission has specially set up two dining halls to take care of the different customs and religious beliefs of our various ethnic groups, one is a halal dining hall, and the other is an ordinary dining hall; and the cleanest and quietest rooms are selected for the representatives of various ethnic groups who believe in Islam to perform their prayers. We are taken care of in every possible way in our lives, and everyone feels more comfortable and convenient than at home.
    On the eve of National Day, Chairman Mao held a grand celebration banquet for two thousand people, and we were honored to be invited to participate; Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai also held grand receptions, specially to entertain us. Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai cared for us so earnestly, and toasted to our health and the unity of all ethnic groups; we also frequently toasted Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai to express our infinite respect for the people of all ethnic minorities. At this time, we were all so happy and felt infinite happiness.
    On October 1st, we participated in the grand celebration of the Third National Day held in Tiananmen Square. The solemn Tiananmen Square was decorated in a particularly beautiful way. The five-star red flag flying in the wind on the high pole in the center of the square and the thousands of red flags in the square formed a sea of red. When we saw the mighty procession of 500,000 people passing through Tiananmen Square, accepting Chairman Mao's review and joyously shouting "Long live Chairman Mao"; when we saw the international friends and observation representatives from all sides on the viewing platform applauding and welcoming Chairman Mao; when we saw the powerful mechanized units of the People's Liberation Army and the militia of all ethnic groups marching past the Tiananmen review stand in rows, we felt infinite excitement and pride.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in our capital, and the conference invited our representatives to attend. We witnessed the great conference from its enthusiastic opening to its successful closing. We have a deeper understanding and a stronger confidence in victory in the cause of defending peace. In several occasions of our contact with peace fighters from thirty-seven countries, we often heard them shout in our motherland's language "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Chinese people!" "Long live peace!" We were so moved that we shed tears. We deeply thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for bringing this honor to the people of all our ethnic groups.
    We made many visits in the capital. At the Central Institute for Nationalities, we saw the talents of ethnic minorities growing. Young people of all ethnic groups gathered together to receive political and cultural education; the languages and scripts of all ethnic groups were listed as important courses. At the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, we saw the working class completely turned over politically, economically, and culturally. The workers have their own trade unions and have become the masters of the factory; more than one-third of the workers in the factory have watches and bicycles; all workers have the opportunity to learn to read and write, and enjoy all kinds of cultural life. In the past three years, the factory has produced 947 labor models, and the production volume has increased several times compared with before liberation. In 1951 alone, the rationalization proposals created a value equivalent to 2,140 tons of grain. Now all the workers in the factory are responding to Chairman Mao's great call and launching a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. We also went to the Beijing Mechanized Agricultural College (formerly the Mechanized Farming School of the Central Ministry of Agriculture). In the past two years, this school has trained more than 2,500 mechanized agricultural cadres for the country. We visited the Beijing Municipal Materials Exchange Conference. It showed the richness of our motherland and the great achievements of the three years of construction. The fact that the industry and agriculture of the motherland are developing rapidly and the prospect of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization greatly encourage us. We also visited the Yonghe Lamasery and the mosque, and the representatives who believe in Islam were very grateful for Chairman Mao's and the Chinese Communist Party's policy of freedom of religious belief.
    We also visited some exhibitions. The most impressive one for us was the "Exhibition of Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by the U.S. Government." We hate the inhuman atrocities of U.S. imperialism. From the serious harm that bacteriological weapons will bring to mankind, we have a deeper understanding of the value of peace and are determined to strengthen our support for the Chinese People's Volunteers in order to win the final victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    In the capital, whether we are visiting or sightseeing, we are warmly welcomed and respected everywhere. Several elders who had been to Beijing before liberation often said excitedly: "Beijing has completely changed. Today's Beijing is the Beijing of the people. What we feel everywhere is enthusiasm, friendship, and kindness." This is the unanimous feeling of all our representatives.
    We thank the responsible comrades of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission for giving us reports and soliciting our opinions on the work in ethnic minority areas, which makes us more deeply aware that the past national oppression and ethnic feuds were entirely the evil results of the reactionary fascist policies implemented by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and their instigation of discord. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 60 ethnic groups across the country are completely equal in the big family of mutual assistance and friendship among all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, and are working together to move towards prosperity and happiness. The liberation and development of our ethnic minorities are inseparable from the indelible contributions of the Han elder brother in the liberation struggle of the Chinese nation and the selfless help to us after liberation. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. We sincerely thank Chairman Mao. In the future great construction of the motherland, all our ethnic groups will unite more closely and advance bravely under the glorious banner of Chairman Mao.
    Although we only stayed in the capital, Beijing, for a short month, each of us received many valuable educations, just like attending a university.

    首都一月
    西北各民族国庆节观礼代表团秘书长  禹占林
    我们西北各民族国庆节观礼代表团荣幸地来到首都北京。我们住在设备很完善的招待所里。中央民族事务委员会为照顾我们各民族不同的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，特意设了两处饭厅，一处是清真饭厅，一处是普通饭厅；并选择最清洁和最肃静的房间供信仰伊斯兰教的各民族代表做礼拜。我们在生活上得到无微不至的照料，大家都感到比在自己家里更舒适方便。
    国庆节前夕，毛主席举行了二千人的盛大的庆祝宴会，我们荣幸地被邀参加；朱总司令、周总理也举行了盛大的酒会，特意招待我们。毛主席、朱总司令和周总理那样恳切地关心我们，为我们的健康和各民族的团结干杯；我们也频频地向毛主席、朱总司令和周总理敬酒，表达我们各少数民族人民无限的敬意。这时，我们都是那样欢欣，感到无限幸福。
    十月一日，我们参加了在天安门广场上举行的隆重的第三届国庆节盛典。庄严的天安门，装缀得特别美丽，广场中心的高杆上迎风飘扬的五星红旗和广场上千万面红旗汇成了一片红海。当我们看到五十万人的队伍浩浩荡荡地从天安门前经过，接受毛主席检阅并欢腾地高呼“毛主席万岁”的时候；当我们看到观礼台上的国际友人和各方面的观礼代表向毛主席鼓掌欢迎的时候；当我们看到强大的人民解放军的机械化部队和各族民兵一列一列地从天安门检阅台前走过的时候，我们感到无限的兴奋与骄傲。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我们的首都召开，会议邀请了我们的代表列席。我们亲眼看见这个伟大的会议由热烈开幕到胜利闭幕。我们对于保卫和平的事业有了更深的认识和更坚强的胜利信心。在我们与三十七个国家的和平战士们相接触的几个场合中，我们常常听到他们用我们祖国的语言高呼“毛泽东万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”“和平万岁！”我们激动得流出了热泪。我们深深感谢中国共产党和毛主席给我们各族人民带来的这种荣誉。
    我们在首都进行了许多次参观。在中央民族学院，我们看到少数民族的人材在生长着。各民族的青年济济一堂，在受着政治的和文化的教育；各民族的语言文字被列为重要课程。在石景山钢铁厂，我们看见了工人阶级在政治上、经济上、文化上的彻底翻身。工人有了自己的工会，当了工厂的主人；全厂三分之一以上的工人有了手表和脚踏车；工人都获得了读书识字的机会，享受着种种的文化生活。该厂三年来出现了九百四十七个劳动模范，生产量比解放前提高了好几倍，仅一九五一年的合理化建议便创造了相当于两千一百四十吨粮食的价值。现在全厂工人正响应毛主席的伟大号召，开展着轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。我们还到了北京机械化农业学院（前中央农业部机耕学校）。这个学校两年来已给国家训练了两千五百多名机械化农业干部。我们参观了北京市物资交流大会。它显示了我们祖国的富饶和三年来建设的伟大成就。祖国工农业飞跃发展的事实及国家工业化和农业集体化的远景，大大地鼓舞着我们。我们还参观了雍和宫喇嘛寺和清真寺，信仰伊斯兰教的代表对毛主席和中国共产党的信教自由政策，都非常感激。
    我们也参观了一些展览会。给我们印象最深刻的是“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”。我们痛恨美帝国主义灭绝人性的兽行。从细菌武器将给人类带来的严重危害中，我们更加深刻地体会到和平的可贵，并决心加强支持中国人民志愿军的工作，以争取抗美援朝的最后胜利。
    我们在首都，无论是参观或游览，到处都受到热烈的欢迎和尊重。解放前曾到过北京的几位老者常常激动地说：“北京完全变了，今天的北京是人民的北京了。我们到处所感到的是热情、是友爱、是亲切。”这是我们全体代表一致的感觉。
    我们感谢中央民族事务委员会的负责同志向我们作报告，并征询我们对各民族地区工作的意见，使我们更深切地认识到过去的民族压迫和民族仇杀完全是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮实行反动的法西斯政策、进行挑拨离间所造成的恶果。今天，全国六十多个民族在中国共产党的领导下，在中华人民共和国这个各民族互助友爱的大家庭里已一律平等，并携手走向繁荣与幸福的道路。我们少数民族的解放与发展是和汉族老大哥在中华民族解放斗争中的不可磨灭的贡献以及解放后对我们无私的帮助分不开的。这是毛主席民族政策的伟大胜利。我们衷心感谢毛主席。在今后祖国伟大的建设中，我们各民族将更加紧密地团结起来，在毛主席光辉的旗帜下奋勇前进。
    我们这次到首都北京，虽然只逗留了短短的一个月时间，但是我们每一个人都像上了一次大学一样，受到了许许多多宝贵的教育。
