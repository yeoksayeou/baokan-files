    The Militant Tasks of Literary Criticism

    The *Pravda* published an editorial on November 30, pointing out the urgent tasks of Soviet literary critics. An excerpt follows:

    The militant task of our literary criticism is to implement the Party's instructions and actively promote the further growth and prosperity of Soviet literature. Literary criticism and book reviews are important weapons for propaganda and communist education.

    Comrade Stalin taught us that writers should write the truth. The primary task of literary criticism is to strive to reflect life truthfully, profoundly, and realistically in artistic images, and to reflect reality in the revolutionary development of reality, in the irreconcilable struggle between the new and the old. However, literary criticism has not given timely blows to the false, decadent "theory" of no conflict, and the fear of criticism and self-criticism is the foundation of this "theory."

    The fundamental responsibility of our literary criticism and literary research is to constantly arm ourselves with the science of Marxism-Leninism and creatively study the pressing issues of socialist realism. We must resolutely eliminate the vulgarized views on typicality that are spread among some literary critics and writers. The leftist attack on Lācis's excellent novel "To the New Shore" is a prominent example of a vulgar attitude toward the definition of typicality.

    The recent meeting of the Department of Literature and Language of the Soviet Academy of Sciences proved how active that incorrect view of typicality is. Professor Timofeyev asserted in his report at the meeting that it seems that negative images in our literature cannot be typical because they are individual phenomena, "phenomena in personal aspects." Here again, there is an attempt to restore that decadent concept of describing typicality only as a statistical average. This position violates the Marxist-Leninist understanding of typicality and denies the creation of satirical typical images in works depicting our lives. As is well known, the typical is not only the most common thing but also the thing that most fully and sharply expresses the essence of a certain social force.

    The struggle for a correct understanding of typicality—as the basic category of the manifestation of Party spirit in realist art—and the struggle for the creation of brilliant and vivid typical images of various kinds are the urgent tasks of literary critics today.

    Only strict and principled, well-founded and appropriate criticism can smoothly promote the creative growth of literature and have a positive influence on the development of literature. Our criticism should boldly support everything truly advanced, support every artist's success, expose various manifestations of bourgeois ideology, and fight against the lack of ideology, falsity, grayness, and mediocrity in literary and artistic works.

    On Some Issues of Creative Collaboration

    The *Labor Daily* published an article by Markov on August 26, which

    explores some issues in the creative collaboration between scientific research institutions and factories in Leningrad. An excerpt follows:

    The creative collaboration between scientific personnel and production workers has opened up new, truly endless possibilities for accelerating technological progress. But it should be said that this possibility is not being fully utilized everywhere.

    In some universities in Leningrad, scientific research work has not been fully expanded on a large scale. At the same time, the connection between some colleges and production is still insufficient.

    Some scientific institutions and universities waste their energy on many accidental, sometimes minor, tasks. Some well-known scholars are often busy with small problems, focusing their attention on daily production tasks. Individual leaders in enterprises often have the opinion that professors, academicians, and other scientific personnel are truly helping production only when they participate in eliminating a certain, even minor, accident in the enterprise.

    This view is wrong, and it has no other meaning than to prevent the rational use of scientific power and vulgarize the idea of ​​creative collaboration itself. Our task is on the other hand: we should enable famous scholars to accumulate materials, carefully observe and draw conclusions when studying production practice and delving into these practices, so as to put forward and solve the most important issues related to the prospect of development.

    In addition, there is another bad situation: some colleges and lectures do not delve into the most important issues in the development of technology at all, and they forget Lomonosov's principle - it is impossible to be separated from practice in this world full of problems. At present, there are still many scientific institutions that treat cooperation with producers formally, and regard this cooperation as a "fashionable" current "trend" suitable for "fashion." As a result, some empty and useless contracts have emerged that cannot reflect the tasks facing enterprises and scientific institutions, and cannot adapt to the conditions available to these colleges. For example, the contract signed between the Mechanics of Materials Department of the Leningrad Institute of Technology and the First Letter Foundry is like this. This contract reduces the cooperation between scholars and producers to holding visits and lectures, which, needless to say, is far from the real task of cooperation.

    It is also common to encounter some unserious facts, and sometimes even an irresponsible attitude towards the cooperation contracts signed between colleges and factories. For example, since 1951, the Physics Department of the Leningrad Institute of Technology has been responsible for helping the "Electricity" factory to conduct research on the refining of a certain part. This is a major event, but, regrettably, none of the scientific workers of the Physics Department of the Institute has ever been to the factory.

    In order to further develop creative cooperation, comprehensively solving scientific problems is of great significance. In this regard, higher industrial colleges with various scientific experts have the most favorable conditions. For example, the plan of the Railway Transport Engineers College contains many comprehensive problems; in the process of solving the problem of safe operation of electric trains on electrified railways, four lectures from the Mechanics Department, a scientific research institute, and some railway staff participated in the research work. But unfortunately, there are still very few such cases.

    Many research works often repeat each other. Several scientific institutions often work at the same time to solve the same technical problem. It also often happens that a problem that has already been solved in one research institute is "solved" again in another research institute. Therefore, how to establish mutual notification between scientific research institutions that implement creative cooperation with production units should be considered.

    It should be pointed out that some leaders of enterprises do not pay much attention to the significance and strength of creative cooperation between science and production. They warmly welcome this cooperation in words, but when the fruits of this cooperation are about to appear in reality, they are hindered by conservatism and fear of new things. Because of this, many valuable works have not been implemented in the end.

    It is beneficial to frequently hold joint meetings of the chief engineers of enterprises and staff members of various lectures in various universities to listen to mutual reports on creative cooperation. At scientific and technological conferences, open technical discussions should be held on the work in the process of execution, and the contracts should be systematically checked on both sides. All these will help consolidate the cooperation between scientific personnel and producers, and smoothly complete new tasks in the struggle for technological progress.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    文学批评的战斗任务
    真理报于十一月三十日发表社论，指出苏联文学批评家的迫切任务。摘要如下：
    我们的文学批评的战斗任务，就是实现党的指示，积极促进苏维埃文学的进一步增长和繁荣。文学批评和书报评论，是宣传和进行共产主义教育的重要武器。
    斯大林同志教导我们作家要写真实的情况。文学批评的首要任务，就是要争取在艺术形象中真实地、深刻地、写实主义地反映生活，就是争取在现实的革命发展中，在新与旧的不可调和的斗争中反映现实。然而，文学批评没有适时地给虚伪的、腐朽的没有冲突的“理论”以打击，恐惧批评与自我批评就是这种“理论”的基础。
    我们文学批评和文学研究的根本的职责，就是经常用马克思—列宁主义的科学全副武装起来，创造性地研究社会主义写实主义的迫切问题。应当坚决地肃清散布在一部分文学批评家和文学家之间的那种关于典型的庸俗化的见解。对拉齐斯的卓越的小说“到新岸去”的左倾的攻击，就是对待典型的定义的庸俗态度的显著例子。
    最近召开过的苏联科学院文学和语言部的会议，就证明了那种对典型的不正确的观点是多么活跃。齐莫菲耶夫教授在会上所作的报告中曾断言，好像我们的文学中的反面形象不能够是典型的，因为这是个别的现象，这是“个人方面的现象”。这里又企图恢复那种把典型只说成是统计的平均数的腐朽概念。这种立场是违反马克思—列宁主义关于典型的理解，是否认在描写我们生活的作品中创造讽刺的典型形象。如所周知，典型不仅是最常见的事物而且是最充分、最尖锐地表现一定社会力量的本质的事物。
    为正确理解典型——作为党性在现实主义艺术中表现的基本范畴——而斗争，为创造光辉的和生动的各种典型的形象而斗争，是文学批评家当前刻不容缓的问题。
    唯有严格的和有原则的，有根据的和恰当的批评，能够顺利地促使文学的创造的增长，能够给文学发展以良好的影响。我们的批评在大胆地支持一切真正先进的、支持每个艺术家的成功时，应当揭露资产阶级思想的各种表现，为反对文学和艺术作品中没有思想性、虚伪、灰色和平庸而斗争。
    论创造性合作的一些问题
    劳动报八月二十六日登载了马尔柯夫的论文，其中
    探讨列宁格勒各科学研究机关和工厂进行创造性合作
    中的一些问题。摘要如下：
    科学人员和生产工作者的创造性合作，为加速技术的进步开辟了新的、真正的无穷无尽的可能性。但是应当说，这种可能性还不是到处都被充分利用的。
    在列宁格勒的一些高等学校中，还没有大规模地充分地展开科学研究工作。同时，一些学院与生产的联系还很不够。
    一些科学机关和高等学校把本身的精力浪费于很多偶发的、有时是次要的工作。一些著名学者往往忙于小问题，集中注意力于日常的生产任务。企业中的个别领导者常有这样的意见，认为教授、院士等科学人员只有参加消灭企业中的某一种、甚至是细小的事故的工作，才是真正帮助了生产。
    这种意见是错误的，其中除了使科学力量得不到合理的使用并使创造性合作的思想本身庸俗化以外，什么意义也没有。我们的任务是在另一方面：我们应当使著名的学者们在研究生产实践和钻研这些实践时，能够累积材料、细心观察和作出结论，以便提出并解决有关发展远景的最重大的问题。
    此外还有一种不好的情况：一些学院和讲座完全没有钻研发展技术方面最切要的问题，他们忘记了罗蒙诺索夫的原则——生活在这个问题众多的世界上，是不能脱离实践的。目前，还有不少的科学机关形式地对待与生产者的合作，和把这种合作看作是适合“时尚”的当前的“时髦”事情。因此出现了一些空洞的、无用的合同，不能反映企业和科学机关面前的任务，不能与这些学院所具备的条件相适应的合同。例如列宁格勒工学院材料力学讲座和第一铅字铸造工厂所订的合同就是这样。这个合同使学者和生产者间的合作归结为举行参观和讲演之类，这不消说，是与合作的真正任务差得远的。
    还可以常常遇到一些不严肃的事实，有时甚至是对学院和工厂间所订的合作合同，采取不负责任的态度。例如列宁格勒工学院物理学讲座自一九五一年起就负责帮助“电力”厂进行精制一种零件的研究工作。这是一件重大的事情，但，遗憾的是该院物理学讲座的科学工作者们竟没有一个人去过该工厂。
    为了进一步发展创造性合作，综合地解决科学问题是有重大意义的。在这方面，拥有各种科学专家的高等工业学院具备着最有利的条件。例如，在铁路运输工程师学院的计划中包含着很多综合性的问题；在电气化铁路上电气列车的安全行驶问题的解决过程中，曾有力学系的四个讲座，一个科学研究学院和一些铁路工作人员参加了研究工作。但可惜的是这类事例还很少。
    很多研究工作时常彼此重复。有若干科学机关往往为解决同一技术问题而同时进行工作。也常有这样的事：在某一研究院业已解决的一个问题，在另一个研究院重新来“解决”它。因此，那些与生产单位实行创造性合作的科学研究机关之间如何建立相互通报是应当考虑的问题。
    应当指出，某些企业的领导人还不很重视科学和生产的创造性合作的意义和力量。他们在口头上热烈欢迎这种合作，但是等到这种合作的成果实际上快要出现了，却为守旧和害怕新事物的心理所妨碍。正因为如此，很多有价值的工作终于没有贯彻。
    在各个高等学校中，时常举行企业总工程师和各种讲座工作人员的联席会议，听取有关创造性合作的相互报告，这是有益的。在科学技术会议上，应当就执行过程中的工作，进行公开的技术讨论，并有系统地对合同作双方面的检查。所有这些都会有助于巩固科学人员和生产者的合作，并在争取技术进步斗争中顺利地完成新任务。
