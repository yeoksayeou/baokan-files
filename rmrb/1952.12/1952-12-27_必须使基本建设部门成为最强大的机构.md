The specific manifestation of placing basic construction in the primary position is to quickly transfer sufficient outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers to enrich the basic construction department and make it the most powerful institution. This is a major transformation in the organizational form of state-owned enterprises.

The experience of the past three years has proven that the complexity of basic construction far exceeds that of production. If production poses the question of efficiency, basic construction poses the question of success or failure. We must remember the lessons of building useless fertilizer plants like the one in Guangzhou and opening the already-hollowed-out Dingxiang Iron Mine. This also proves that basic construction is not easy.

Next year's basic construction tasks will be several times greater than this year's, and hundreds of new and rebuilt enterprises will begin surveying, design, or construction. These enterprises are large in scale, have modern equipment, are more complex than past projects, and have higher technical requirements. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to organize strong basic construction institutions to undertake this arduous task.

The basic construction institution should be a complete working system. The planning department, based on the needs of the national economy, correctly proposes the requirements for product types and quantities within a certain period, which is the basis for carrying out basic construction. In the past, some newly built enterprises could not start construction or had to rework because what to produce and how much to produce could not be determined, or changed after being determined. Therefore, strengthening the guidance of the planning department for basic construction is of fundamental significance. After the planning policy is determined, the administrative department of basic construction should formulate and implement the plan and check the results. The leading organs at all levels of the enterprise must establish this special institution as a comprehensive department for managing basic construction work.

To complete the basic construction plan, we must rely on four main departments: surveying and design, construction, supply, and personnel training. According to Soviet experience and our experience over the past three years, factory design is more conducive to centralization than decentralization. Decentralization will waste manpower due to many identical tasks and make it difficult to master advanced standards. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a strong, centralized factory design institution to gradually take charge of all design work. At present, the design department is the weakest and needs to mobilize a large number of technical personnel and necessary political cadres to organize design institutes or companies to work under unified planning and leadership. This is the first key to ensuring basic construction.

In terms of construction, the existing strength is also very small and must be expanded accordingly with the design strength. Each industry and region should have a special institution responsible for rapidly establishing or enriching various engineering companies such as construction and installation, and fixing a certain proportion of workers, using the spare time this winter to intensify training. In the past, the progress of many projects was delayed because the supply work could not keep up with the needs of construction. Therefore, it is also very necessary to organize strong equipment ordering institutions and material supply and transportation institutions. Without this guarantee, the task cannot be completed. When enterprise construction begins, production personnel must also be prepared. This also requires a special institution to be responsible for the planned training of management cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers. The so-called enriching the basic construction department is to first establish and improve these main links. In the process of establishing and enriching the basic construction institution, we should prevent the tendency of being disproportionately heavy or light. For example, some departments only pay attention to the development of construction forces while ignoring the strength of other departments, which should also be corrected.

The speed and extent of expanding and concentrating basic construction forces should not only be based on next year's tasks, but also take into account the needs of the next few years. This requires all departments to formulate detailed development plans. Careful calculations are especially necessary for design and construction forces. The leading comrades of each ministry must personally take charge of this work; it is impossible to do it well by simply making general arrangements. The various financial and economic departments of the Central People's Government, the various bureaus, and their affiliated enterprises should focus on strengthening the basic construction institution, prevent the tendency to disperse forces and develop equally.

Enriching the basic construction institution requires a large number of cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers. At present, the fastest and most reliable source of personnel is to transfer them from production, and this policy must be resolutely implemented.

At present, although the steps and methods taken by various regions and departments to strengthen basic construction are necessary, they are obviously not enough in terms of the scale and speed of concentrating forces. Some units have not yet realized the necessity of organizing the basic construction department into the most powerful institution. They have not allocated the most outstanding cadres to the various working departments of basic construction; they have shown insufficient determination to transfer cadres from production, and they have hesitated and hesitated, so that basic construction work has not been truly strengthened. This situation seriously threatens the possibility of completing next year's basic construction tasks and must be improved without hesitation.

The policy of transferring outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers from production to enrich the basic construction institution is in line with the greatest interests of national construction. At present, the basic construction force that the country already possesses, in addition to ordinary workers, has been gradually transferred from production over the past three years as the basic construction tasks have increased; production has continuously trained new cadres to take over their work. Taking the Northeast machinery industry as an example: About half of the leading cadres of the current enterprises are outstanding elements cultivated from among the workers; the management personnel below the workshop director are almost all worker cadres; most of the engineering and technical personnel have been separated from production management work and participated in product design and factory design work. But production is still continuing to progress. This fact proves that production will never collapse after personnel are transferred from production.

However, at present, the leading comrades of some departments still lack confidence in transferring personnel from production. They are helpless in the face of various obstacles from production, and therefore cannot quickly enrich the basic construction institution. Many enterprises are still emphasizing difficulties, emphasizing that production will collapse after cadres and technical personnel are transferred, in order to refuse transfer; some people take the method of dragging, bargaining on time and number, and strive to delay the transfer and reduce the number of transfers. Finally, they want the superiors to guarantee that this is the only transfer. This attitude is obviously unfavorable to national construction. These comrades have not yet understood the decisive significance of basic construction for national industrialization. They only consider the partial and immediate needs, and ignore the long-term interests of the country and the people. They only see the difficult side of production, but not the particularly difficult side of basic construction. They still do not understand that production can continue to train new cadres, while basic construction cadres still lack sources. They only consider how to do a good job in the production of a department, but not whether national construction will be delayed because of this. People who hold this attitude obviously have departmentalism and should be criticized.

In order to ensure the completion of the national construction task, people must be transferred, and they need to be transferred in complete sets. From the perspective of development trends, it is better to transfer sooner than later, and the later it is, the more passive it becomes. Continuously sending cadres and skilled workers to basic construction within a certain period should be one of the tasks of production. The leading cadres at all levels of the enterprise must implement this policy with the greatest determination, and also study various methods to ensure that production is not affected or temporarily less affected. It is not permissible to delay the implementation of this policy under any pretext.

Staff who have been transferred to the industrial sector should actively participate in basic construction. However, some people still only want to work in production. For example, they are unwilling to participate in design work, because design work is technically demanding, thinking that this is only a matter for technical personnel, and they are laymen who cannot get into it. Of course, the technical requirements of design work are relatively high, so it is also dominated by technical personnel; but it still requires a considerable number of non-technical personnel. Since we do not have enough technical personnel, we must turn laymen into experts, and the current technical personnel still need veteran cadres to unite and organize them, otherwise the design work cannot be done well.

Basic construction is a completely new subject for us. Chairman Mao taught us that "we must learn what we don't understand ourselves," "get into it, a few months, a year or two, three years or five years, we can always learn it." Some people are unwilling to delve into basic construction work, thinking that this kind of thing is not as good as managing production to learn skills, so they ask to go to factories but are unwilling to go to engineering companies, let alone work on construction sites, and they are often more resistant to managing the supply of equipment and materials. These attitudes are obviously wrong. Every working department of basic construction needs the participation of outstanding cadres, and any plan that only starts from personal interests should be criticized.

It is already urgent to earnestly enrich the basic construction institution. All departments must quickly and effectively concentrate their forces and improve their work organization to strive to prepare for next year's work in the shortest possible time. To this end, all departments must oppose waiting and hesitation, overcome various obstacles, and resolutely transfer outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers from production to organize the basic construction department into the most powerful institution with the greatest determination and confidence.

    必须使基本建设部门成为最强大的机构
    崔中
    把基本建设放在首要地位的具体表现，就是迅速抽调足够的优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人充实基本建设部门，并使之成为最强大的机构。这是国家企业的组织形式的重大转变。
    过去三年的经验业已证明，基本建设的复杂性远超过生产。如果说生产对于我们所提出的问题是效率高低，那末基本建设所提出的问题则是成功或失败。我们过去建设过广州那样无用的肥料工厂，开过已经挖空的定襄铁矿，这些经验教训必须牢记。这也证明基本建设不是轻而易举的。
    明年的基本建设任务将较今年增大几倍，数以百计的新建企业和改建企业将分别开始勘察设计或施工。这些企业，规模巨大，设备近代化，较过去的工程更复杂，技术要求也更高。因此，组织强有力的基本建设机构去担任这个艰巨任务是极为必要的。
    基本建设机构应当是一个完整的工作体系。计划部门根据国民经济的需要，正确地提出在一定时期内对于产品种类和数量的要求，是进行基本建设的根据。过去一些新建企业，因为生产什么和生产多少不能确定，或在确定后又发生变化，曾使建设工作无法开始或者返工。因此，加强计划部门对于基本建设的指导，是有根本意义的。计划方针确定之后，应由基本建设的行政部门编制执行的计划，组织其执行，并检查结果。企业的各级领导机关必须设立这个专门机构，作为管理基本建设工作的综合部门。
    要完成基本建设计划必须依靠四个主要部门，这就是勘察设计部门、施工部门、供应部门和人员的培养与训练的部门。按照苏联的经验和我们三年来的经验，工厂设计利于集中，不利于分散。分散会因许多相同工作而浪费人力，也难以掌握先进标准。因此建立强大的、集中的工厂设计机构，逐渐负责全部设计工作是有必要的。目前设计部门最薄弱，需要调集大批技术人员和必要的政治干部，组织设计院或公司，在统一计划与统一领导下进行工作。这是保证基本建设的第一个关键。
    在施工方面，现有力量也很小，必须随同设计力量相应扩大。各行业各地区应当有一个专门机构，负责迅速地建立或充实建筑与安装等各种工程公司，并把一定比例的工人固定下来，利用今冬空隙加紧训练。过去因为供应工作跟不上施工的需要，曾使许多工程的建设进度推迟，因此，组织强有力的设备订货机构和材料供应运输机构也是非常必要的。缺乏这一方面的保证也不能完成任务。在企业建设开始的时候，又必须准备生产人员。这也要有专门机构负责有计划地培养与训练管理干部、技术人员和技术工人。所谓充实基本建设部门，就是要把这些主要环节首先建立和健全起来。在建立与充实基本建设机构的过程中，应当防止畸重畸轻的偏向。譬如有些部门只注意发展建筑力量，而忽视其他部门的力量，这也是应当纠正的。
    扩大与集中基本建设力量的速度与程度，不但应根据明年的任务，而且还要照顾今后几个年度的需要。这就需要各部门制订出周密的发展计划。对于设计和施工力量，尤其要仔细地计算。各部的领导同志必须亲自下手主持这件工作，仅仅是采取一般的布置是不可能作好的。中央人民政府各个财经部门、各管理局及其所属的各企业，在加强基本建设机构这个问题上应有重点，防止分散力量和平均发展的倾向。
    充实基本建设机构，需要大批干部、技术人员和技术工人。现时最迅速最可靠的人员来源是从生产中抽调，这一方针必须坚决予以贯彻执行。
    目前，各地区各部门加强基本建设的步骤和办法，虽然都是必要的，但从集中力量的规模和速度上看，显然还不够。有些单位还没有认识到把基本建设部门组成为最强大的机构的必要性。他们没有把最优秀的干部配置到基本建设的各个工作部门；对于从生产中抽调干部表现决心不足，因循犹豫，以致基本建设工作并未能真正地加强起来。这种情况严重地威胁着完成明年基本建设任务的可能性，必须毫不迟疑地加以改善。
    从生产中抽调优秀干部、技术人员和技术工人以充实基本建设机构的方针，是符合国家建设的最大利益的。目前国家已经拥有的基本建设力量，除普通工人以外，都是三年来随着基本建设任务的增加，从生产方面逐渐转移过来的；生产中则不断训练出新的干部来接替他们的工作。以东北机器工业为例：目前各企业的领导干部已有半数左右是工人中培养起来的优秀分子；自车间主任以下的管理人员已几乎全部是工人干部；工程技术人员已大部分脱离生产管理工作，参加了产品设计和工厂设计工作。但生产还是在继续不断地进步。这一事实证明从生产方面抽调人员以后，生产是决不会垮台的。
    然而，目前有些部门的领导同志，对于从生产中抽调人员的信心仍然不足。他们对于来自生产方面的各种阻碍束手无策，因而不能够迅速地把基本建设机构充实起来。不少企业仍在强调困难，强调在干部和技术人员抽走之后，生产就会垮台以拒绝抽调，有人则采取拖的办法，在时间和人数上讲价钱，力争迟调和少调。最后还要上级向他保证只调这一次。这种态度显然是不利于国家建设的。这些同志还没有了解基本建设对于国家工业化的决定意义。他们只为局部的和眼前的需要打算，忽视国家和人民的长远利益。他们仅仅看见了生产中困难的一面，而没有看见基本建设中尤其困难的一面。他们还不了解生产中可以继续不断地训练出新的干部，而基本建设干部则还缺乏来源。他们只考虑如何搞好一个部门的生产，而不考虑国家建设是否将因此而推迟。抱有这种态度的人，显然是有本位主义的观点，应当加以批判。
    为了保证国家建设任务的完成，人是一定要抽调的，而且需要成套地抽调出来。从发展趋势来看，迟抽不如早抽，愈迟愈被动。在一定时期内向基本建设方面不断输送干部和技术工人，应当是生产方面的任务之一。企业的各级领导干部，必须以最大的决心贯彻这个方针，而且还要研究出各种办法，使生产不受影响或暂时少受影响。以任何藉口来延缓这一方针的贯彻，都是不能容许的。
    转业到工业部门的工作人员，应当积极地参加基本建设。然而，有些人却仍然只愿意到生产方面工作。譬如他们不愿意参加设计工作，理由是设计工作技术性高，以为这只是技术人员的事情，自己是外行，钻不进去。当然，设计工作的技术要求是较高的，因此也是以技术人员为主的；但它仍然需要相当数量的非技术人员。我们既没有足够的技术人员，就必须把外行变成内行，而且目前的技术人员仍需要老干部去团结和组织他们，否则设计工作也不能做好。
    基本建设对于我们来说是一个全新的课题。毛主席教导我们“我们必须学会自己不懂的东西”“钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的”。有的人不愿意钻到基本建设工作中去，认为这类事情不如管生产能学到本事，因此要求下工厂不愿到工程公司，更不愿到工地工作，对于管理设备器材的供应工作，往往抵触更大。这种种态度显然是错误的。基本建设的每一工作部门都需要优秀的干部参加，任何只从个人兴趣出发的打算都应该受到批判。
    把基本建设机构认真地充实起来，这已经是刻不容缓的了。各部门必须迅速有效地集中力量，健全工作组织，以争取于最短时间内作好明年的准备工作。为此各部门必须以最大的决心和信心，反对等待和犹豫，克服各种障碍，坚决地从生产中抽调优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人，把基本建设部门组成为最强大的机构。
