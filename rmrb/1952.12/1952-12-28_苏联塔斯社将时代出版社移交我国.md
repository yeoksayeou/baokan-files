    Soviet TASS Transfers the Era Publishing House to Our Country

    Soviet TASS has gratuitously transferred the Era Publishing House, which it founded in China, to our government. The transfer formalities were completed on December 25th. Representing TASS in the transfer was Bian Miannuofu, Acting Director of the TASS branch in China. The Chinese government was represented by Huang Luofeng, Director of the General Office of the General Administration of Publications, who accepted the transfer.

    The Era Publishing House was established in Shanghai in 1941. Over the past eleven years, it has published various periodicals and newspapers in Chinese, including "Era" magazine, "Soviet Literature," "Soviet Medicine," and "Era Daily," as well as the Russian "Era" magazine, and the English "Daily War Bulletin," "Daily News," and "Soviet Weekly." It has also published 402 books on social sciences, literature and art, language, natural sciences, and medicine, making significant contributions to introducing Marxism-Leninism and Soviet culture to the Chinese people. The publications of the Era Publishing House have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people.

    After the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government takes over the publishing house, it has decided to entrust the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headquarters with the responsibility of leading the work of the publishing house in order to continue to develop the cause of introducing Soviet culture, which the publishing house has been tirelessly striving for in the past eleven years.
