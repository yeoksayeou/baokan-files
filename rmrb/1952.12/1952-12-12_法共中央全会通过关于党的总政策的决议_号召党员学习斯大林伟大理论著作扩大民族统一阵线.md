Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 11th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session in Gennevilliers from the 5th to the 7th of December. The meeting passed a resolution on the party's general policy.

    The resolution, in discussing the situation, stated: Intolerable military expenditures are destroying the French economy and weighing heavily on the shoulders of the working people. French workers and small farmers are becoming increasingly impoverished, while the profits of the big bourgeoisie and large landowners are rising, and the contradiction between workers and capitalists is growing. This is the most important characteristic of the domestic situation.

    The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for national independence and the growing resistance of the North African people to foreign exploiters are clear evidence of the severe crisis facing French imperialism's colonial system.

    Due to the penetration of American capital into the French economy and colonies, the contradictions between American and French imperialists are growing. There are also contradictions between French imperialism and the revived West German imperialism, but the ruling bloc of the French bourgeoisie still participates in the work of turning West Germany into an aggressive base of imperialism in Europe. With the full support of the right-wing socialists, they are selling out national interests, selling out France's independence and dignity, in order to seek the interests of their own class.

    The French working class resolutely opposes this policy. The broadest strata of the population are also expressing dissatisfaction with this policy. This creates the conditions for uniting the broad masses of the people around the French working class and the French Communist Party.

    The government wants to undermine the growing unity of the working class, to obstruct the unity of peasants, the middle class, and all French men and women who oppose American rule in France around the working class, so it is plotting conspiracies against the Communist Party, trampling on democratic freedoms, and intensifying fascist rule at home.

    The resolution pointed out the current tasks of the French Communist Party: All members have a responsibility to study the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR". Comrade Stalin's work is a powerful ideological weapon in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The French Communist Party must hold high the banner of fighting for democratic freedom, for national independence, for improving the living conditions of the working people. In the course of struggle, the Communist Party must expand and strengthen the national united front formed with all patriots to oppose France's subjugation to American rule, to oppose fascism, war, and poverty, and to demand bread, democratic freedom, national independence, and peace.

    French Communist Party Secretary Duclos delivered a speech at the meeting. Duclos pointed out: The French Communist Party advocates resolving the Tunisian and Moroccan questions on the basis of granting freedom and national independence to the Tunisian and Moroccan peoples, and demands the adoption of the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful settlement of the German question, because the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany is fully in the national interest of France. Duclos called for strengthening the united action of Communists and republican and democratic elements who oppose the enslavement of France by American imperialism, and called on French Communists to further strengthen the ranks of the party.

    法共中央全会通过关于党的总政策的决议
    号召党员学习斯大林伟大理论著作扩大民族统一阵线
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会于五日至七日在日尼维埃举行全体会议。会上通过了关于党的总政策的决议。
    决议谈到形势时说：难于忍受的军事费用破坏了法国的经济，并且像沉重的担子一样压在劳动人民的肩上。法国工人和小农日渐贫困，大资产阶级和大地主的利润上升，工人和资本家的矛盾愈来愈增长。这就是国内局势最主要的特点。
    越南人民为争取民族独立而英勇斗争，北非人民对外国剥削者的抵抗不断增长。这都是法帝国主义殖民制度遭受严重危机的明证。
    由于美国资本渗入法国经济与殖民地，美、法帝国主义者之间的矛盾正在日益增长。法帝国主义和复活中的西德帝国主义之间，也存在矛盾，但是法国资产阶级统治集团仍然参加变西德为帝国主义在欧洲的侵略基地的工作。他们在右翼社会党人的全力支持下，正在出卖民族利益，出卖法国的独立与尊严，来博取它本阶级的利益。
    法国工人阶级坚决反对这种政策。最广泛的各阶层居民也对这种政策表示不满。这就产生了把广大人民群众团结在法国工人阶级和法国共产党周围的条件。
    政府想破坏工人阶级日益增长的团结，想阻挠农民、中产阶级和反对美国统治法国的全体法国男女团结在工人阶级周围，就策划反对共产党的阴谋，蹂躏民主自由，并且加紧国内的法西斯统治。
    决议指出法国共产党当前的任务说：全体党员有责任研究苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件和斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。斯大林同志这部著作是争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争中有力的思想武器。法国共产党必须高高举起争取民主自由、争取民族独立、争取改善劳动人民生活条件的旗帜。在进行斗争中，共产党必须扩大和加强与所有爱国者结成的民族统一阵线，来反对法国屈从美国统治，反对法西斯主义、战争与贫困，要求面包、民主自由、民族独立与和平。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛在会上发表了演说。杜克洛指出：法国共产党主张在给突尼斯与摩洛哥人民以自由和民族独立的基础上解决突尼斯和摩洛哥问题，并且要求采纳苏联关于和平解决德国问题的建议，因为建立统一的、爱好和平的、民主的德国是完全符合于法国民族利益的。杜克洛号召加强共产党人和反对美帝国主义奴役法国的共和民主分子的统一行动，并且号召法国共产党员进一步加强党的队伍。
