Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 19th: According to the U.S. announcement, the number of our captured personnel killed in the Geoje Island massacre has increased from eighty-two to eighty-seven.

    Despite the U.S.'s shameless description of this unprecedented bloody atrocity of massacring POWs as a POW "riot," the truth of the matter has been revealed by Miller, the commander of the U.S. Geoje Island POW camp, the executioner who directly commanded the massacre.

    In a statement to reporters on the 16th, Miller revealed that the situation in the POW camp was "very uneasy" a week before the incident. He said he had received warnings in advance that a "riot" would occur. If one connects Miller's words with the following facts, one can understand why the situation in the POW camp was "very uneasy." This fact is that Harrison, notorious for insisting on forcibly detaining POWs, had been conducting conspiratorial activities in Busan, South Korea, from Tokyo on the 10th. According to the Associated Press, Harrison came to Busan "on a secret mission related to the POW issue," and he would "visit the UN military POW camps and inspect the facilities in Busan Port." It is clear that the reason the situation in the Geoje Island POW camp was "very uneasy" was because the U.S. was intensifying its activities to forcibly detain POWs in the POW camp. Harrison's trip to Busan was clearly planning how to transport this large number of POWs who had been forcibly detained from Geoje Island. And in order to suppress the POWs' resistance, Miller had long been ordered to prepare for a massacre, which is what he received as a warning about the POWs' "riot."

    When the U.S. attempted to transport the forcibly detained POWs on the 14th and was met with resistance, the bloody massacre began. Miller revealed that the U.S. military compressed the unarmed POWs onto a highland, making them stand with their backs to the walls of the barracks, and then opened fire on them with various weapons. According to Miller, the reason the POWs should be massacred was because the POWs believed that "even if only a few POWs could escape the POW camp, it would be their victory," and this would cause executioners like Miller to "lose face." The American invaders were obviously afraid that the POWs who escaped this slaughterhouse would more thoroughly expose the U.S.'s crime of forcibly detaining POWs, so they were determined to silence them.

    In his statement, Miller revealed the earth-shattering and soul-stirring heroic spirit of our captured personnel who resolutely resisted the U.S.'s forced detention and were unyielding to the death. Miller said that when the massacre was taking place, our captured personnel "stood there straight, without dodging the bullets fired from light machine guns, shotguns, carbines and rifles less than thirty yards away. Some POWs intended to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the UN military guards." "They sang and swayed back and forth. After we fired the first volley, the wounded prisoners were supported there and stood still, continuing to sing. Those who fell to the ground were pulled up by their arms." They sang "Communist songs, shouted slogans, and shouted 'Long Live'." Even after being killed and wounded, they remained united and heroic, "When a wounded prisoner was carried to a hospital on Geoje Island ten miles away, he still wanted to sing." The POWs who were killed and wounded all "hooked their arms together and lay on the ground," so that the U.S. "had to forcibly tear them apart. It took two people to tear a POW apart and drag him away." In this way, our unarmed captured personnel waged a tenacious and unyielding struggle with the ferocious enemy armed to the teeth, one after another.

    These facts admitted by the executioner Miller have thoroughly exposed the U.S.'s shameless lie of a POW "riot," and further exposed the U.S.'s heinous crime of forcibly detaining POWs. Observers here pointed out that the Geoje Island massacre of POWs was a direct result of the illegal resolution passed by the UN General Assembly on the Korean issue. Because this resolution fully supports the U.S.'s so-called "principle" of so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation," which is in fact the forcible detention of POWs, the U.S. dares to forcibly detain POWs on a larger scale with confidence, and transfer them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, in order to intensify Eisenhower's conspiracy to "use Asians to fight Asians." Those who passed this illegal resolution in the UN General Assembly, ignoring human conscience, should bear serious responsibility for every drop of blood shed by the POWs on Geoje Island.

### 美方蜂岩岛战俘营头子透露屠杀战俘事件的真相  再次证明美方强迫战俘当炮灰的万恶罪行  我方被俘人员表现了至死不屈的英雄气概

    美方蜂岩岛战俘营头子透露屠杀战俘事件的真相
    再次证明美方强迫战俘当炮灰的万恶罪行
    我方被俘人员表现了至死不屈的英雄气概
    【新华社开城十九日电】据美方宣布，在蜂岩岛大屠杀事件中被打死的我方被俘人员，已经由八十二人增加到了八十七人。
    尽管美方无耻地把这次空前的屠杀战俘的血腥暴行说成是战俘“暴动”，但是事情的真相，已经由直接指挥这次屠杀的刽子手美方蜂岩岛战俘营司令米勒透露了出来。
    米勒在他十六日向记者发表的谈话中，透露在事件发生以前一星期，战俘营的情况就“非常不安”。他说他在事先就已经得到要发生“暴动”的警告。人们如果把米勒的话和下面的事实联系起来，就可以知道为什么战俘营的情况会“非常不安”。这个事实就是：因为坚持强迫扣留战俘而臭名远扬的哈利逊，曾经在十日从东京到南朝鲜的釜山进行阴谋活动。据美联社报道，哈利逊来釜山“负有与战俘问题有关的秘密使命”，他将要“访问联合国军的战俘营并视察釜山港的设备”。人们可以清楚地看出，蜂岩岛战俘营情况所以“非常不安”，是因为美方在战俘营中加紧了强迫扣留战俘的活动。哈利逊的釜山之行，显然是筹划如何将这一大批被强迫扣留下来的战俘从蜂岩岛运走。而为了镇压战俘的反抗，米勒早就奉命准备好进行屠杀，这就是他所得到的关于战俘要“暴动”的警告。
    当美方在十四日要将强迫扣留下来的战俘运走而遭到战俘反抗的时候，血腥屠杀就开始了。米勒透露，美国军队将赤手空拳的战俘压缩到一片高地上，使他们背对着营房的墙壁站着，然后用各种武器对他们开火。根据米勒的说法，战俘之所以应该被屠杀，是因为战俘们认为“只要能有少数几个战俘逃出战俘营，就算是他们的胜利”，而这就会使米勒之类的刽子手们“丢面子”。美国侵略者显然害怕逃出这个屠场的战俘会使美方强迫扣留战俘的罪行更加彻底败露，因此决心要灭他们的口。
    米勒在他的谈话中透露了我方被俘人员坚决抗拒美方强迫扣留，至死不屈的惊天地、泣鬼神的英勇气概。米勒说，当屠杀进行的时候，我方被俘人员“直挺挺地站在那里，对于不到三十码以外的轻机关枪、散弹枪、卡宾枪和步枪所发出的子弹毫不躲避。有的战俘打算和联合国军看守兵进行肉搏战”。“他们一面唱着，一面前后地摆动着。在我们发了第一阵排枪以后，受伤的俘虏被扶在那里直立不动，仍然继续唱着。那些倒在地下的俘虏被扯着胳膊拉了起来。”他们唱着“共产党歌曲，喊口号，高呼‘万岁’”。即使在被打死打伤以后，他们仍然团结一致，英勇不屈，“一个受伤的战俘被抬到十英里以外巨济岛上医院里的时候，他还想唱歌”。被打死打伤的战俘都互相“钩着胳膊躺在地上”，以致美方“不得不硬把他们扯开。要用两个人才能把一个战俘扯开和拖走”。手无寸铁的我方被俘人员就是这样顽强不屈地和武装到了牙齿的凶恶的敌人进行了前仆后继的斗争。
    刽子手米勒所承认的这些事实，已经彻底揭穿了美方的所谓战俘“暴动”的无耻谎话，更进一步暴露了美方强迫扣留战俘的万恶罪行。此间观察家指出，蜂岩岛的屠杀战俘事件，是联合国大会通过关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案的直接结果。由于这个决议案完全支持美方名为所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”实则强迫扣留战俘的所谓“原则”，因此美方就敢于放心大胆地以更大的规模强迫扣留战俘，把他们移交给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮，以便加紧实行艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。联合国大会上那些昧着人类的良心通过这个非法决议案的人，都应当对蜂岩岛上战俘所流的每一滴血负起严重的责任。
