Fully Accomplish the Fifth Five-Year Plan

The Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Ivonin, director of the "Voroshilovgrad Coal Industry United Factory" in the Donbass, on October 24, discussing how coal mine workers in the Donbass are striving to improve their work to achieve the goals of the new Five-Year Plan. The abstract is as follows:

Coal industry workers face significant tasks to be completed during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Over the five-year period, our country's coal production should be increased by approximately 43 percent, and the production of coking coal should be developed at an even faster rate, with its output increasing by at least 50 percent in five years.

To complete the enormous tasks assigned to the coal mining industry by the 19th National Congress of the Party, we must systematically improve coal mining methods, adopt the latest coal mining machinery and equipment on a larger scale to extensively mechanize the coal industry, further modernize the coal industry's technical equipment, and ensure the improvement of labor productivity. Coal industry workers must, by all means, develop the mechanization of the most laborious operations in coal mining—primarily loading coal in the coal face and loading coal and rock during tunnel excavation—and adopt mechanized methods on a larger scale for setting up coal face supports. We will greatly increase the effective production capacity of coal mines and take important measures to improve the quality of coal.

Mastering the designed production capacity of mines is one of the most important potentials for increasing coal production. After the war, the mines in the Donbass were restored and established on a new technical basis. However, the mastery of their designed production capacity has been slow.

The slow mastery of the designed production capacity of mines not only limits the speed of increasing coal production but also has an adverse impact on work quality indicators. Shafts and other equipment and machines within the mine, which are intended for extracting larger quantities of coal, are not being fully utilized; regardless of the amount of fuel extracted by the mine, the number of underground and surface transport workers and workers in other production areas, as well as the administrative and economic personnel, remains basically fixed. Thus, the slow mastery of the designed production capacity leads to an increase in overhead costs and a decline in miners' labor productivity. Therefore, rapidly mastering the production capacity of mines is one of the main ways to improve miners' labor productivity and reduce the cost of fuel extraction.

Another crucial condition for the Donbass coal industry to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan is to further improve miners' labor productivity. The "Voroshilovgrad Coal Industry United Factory" should increase labor productivity by nearly 50 percent over the five years. This task is arduous, especially considering the slow improvement in labor productivity in our factory's mines over the past year and a half. This situation has arisen primarily because our mines have not fully implemented the "cyclical production schedule" method of operation, which allows miners to carry out production most effectively and maximize the efficiency of machinery. Due to defects in organizational and technical leadership, downtime of new machines is still significant in our mines. The use of well-known machines like the "Donbass" combine often does not result in significant production efficiency. Our task is to more persistently adopt the "cyclical production schedule" method of operation and more widely promote the experience of advanced workers and entire collectives.

Mechanizing auxiliary work in various tunnels is also of great significance for improving miners' labor productivity. For example, in our case, almost 15 percent of coal loading and digging workers are engaged in coal cutting preparation work. The Ministry of Coal Industry should immediately take measures to mechanize coal cutting—manufacturing and using machines for carrying out this type of coal cutting work in inclined and steep coal seams. This would improve the labor productivity of miners engaged in preparation work, thereby improving the labor productivity of all miners.

Work on the mine surface is one of the most laborious jobs. In many of my factory's mines, 20 percent of all workers are engaged in mine surface work. Their labor productivity is low. The degree of mechanization of mine surface work lags far behind the mechanization of labor processes in the mine. When the coal industry has shown great technical progress, failure to give due attention to the mechanization of a small portion of work will hinder the improvement of overall labor productivity.

Some individual economic workers and trade union personnel in our mines still adopt a formalistic attitude towards the leadership of socialist production competition. They often reduce their work on this important issue to merely formulating socialist production contracts, without caring about promoting advanced experiences and driving the laggards forward. The socialist production contracts signed between various mines and various miners are usually checked only occasionally, or not at all. Our urgent task is to overcome these important shortcomings, mobilize the broad masses of working people to complete and overfulfill the new Five-Year Plan, and fully support those innovators and advanced individuals who are striving to increase coal production, improve labor productivity, and reduce the cost of fuel extraction.

Persistently Implement the Economy System in All Sections

The "Labor Daily" published an editorial on September 9 entitled "Persistently Implement the Economy System in All Sections," which pointed out the importance and significance of economy. The abstract is as follows:

Reducing the cost of production is the most important source of accumulation. Increasing labor productivity, reducing the consumption of raw materials, supplies, fuel, and electricity per unit of production, making good use of equipment, and reducing overhead costs are the basic paths and methods to ensure the success of competition participants. In the past year, the working people saved the country more than 26 billion rubles by reducing the cost of industrial production.

The economy system is not a short-term movement. The struggle to reduce the cost of production, the struggle to increase the profits of factories, mines, and state farms, and the struggle to complete and overfulfill the accumulation plan should always be the focus of attention of economic organizations and trade union organizations. Economy must be practiced everywhere and in all aspects. Violations of financial discipline must be resolutely stopped, supervision of the expenditure of wage funds must be strengthened, and the wage fund must be used correctly by completing and overfulfilling the plan for the growth of labor productivity and streamlining the management structure.

The implementation of the economy system is inseparable from the struggle to improve the quality of production and the struggle to improve labor organization and production technology. Economy is not only about saving materials, tools, raw materials, and electricity, but also about striving to use more perfect labor methods, striving to maximize the use of technology and adopting advanced manufacturing methods, and striving to widely and systematically adopt the experience of production innovators. That is to say, we must more widely launch a competition to produce products of excellent quality.

Simplification and economy should become an unchanging rule in the work of every enterprise, construction project, mine, and every Soviet person. It is the duty of trade unions and economic leaders to educate all staff to save social property and people's wealth, to more widely develop criticism of waste, and to conscientiously support all valuable initiatives that lead to the expansion of socialist accumulation and the further consolidation of the power of our motherland.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    全力完成第五个五年计划
    苏联“真理报”十月二十四日刊载了顿巴斯“伏罗希洛夫格勒煤业联合工厂”厂长伊伏宁的论文，说到顿巴斯的煤矿工作人员在完成新的五年计划的目标下，如何努力来改进工作，摘要如下：
    煤炭工业的工作人员在第五个五年计划中面临着需要完成的重大任务。在五年期间应当把我国煤的开采量提高约百分之四十三，并以更高速度发展焦煤生产。其产量在五年中至少要增加百分之五十。
    为完成党的第十九次代表大会给煤矿工业所规定的巨大任务，我们必须有步骤地改进采煤方法，更大规模地采用最新式的采煤机器和设备，以便使煤炭工业广泛机械化，以便进一步改装煤炭工业的技术设备并保证劳动生产率的提高。煤炭工业的工作人员必须以一切方法发展采煤工作中最费力的操作过程的机械化——主要是在采煤场装煤、在巷道掘进过程中装煤和装石的操作——并且在装设采煤场支柱方面更大规模地采用机械化方法。我们将要大大地增大煤矿的有效生产能力，并采取重要的方法来提高煤的质量。
    掌握矿坑的预计生产能力是增加煤的产量的最重要潜力之一。战后在新的技术基础上，恢复和建立了顿巴斯的矿井。但是对于它们的预计生产能力的掌握，却是慢吞吞的。
    迟缓地掌握矿井的预计生产能力不仅会限制煤的开采速度的提高，并且也会在工作质量指标上发生不良的影响。矿内预计用作开采更大量的煤的竖坑和一些其他装置及机器没有被充分利用；不管矿井的燃料开采量有多少，矿井的地下和地面的运输工人和其他生产工地的工人人数以及行政—经济人员的编制基本上仍保持着固定的数字。这样，迟缓地掌握预计生产能力，会引起杂费的增加和矿工劳动生产率的下降。因此，迅速掌握矿井的生产能力是提高矿工劳动生产率，降低燃料开采成本的主要途径之一。
    顿巴斯煤炭工业完成第五个五年计划的另一个最重要的条件便是进一步提高矿工的劳动生产率。“伏罗希洛夫格勒煤业联合工厂”在五年中应提高劳动生产率约近百分之五十。这个任务是艰巨的，特别是如果估计到近一年半以来在我厂矿井中劳动生产率的提高的缓慢情形。这种情形的发生首先是由于我们的矿井还没有充分实施“循环生产时间图表制”作业法，这种工作法可以使矿工最有效地进行生产并发挥机器的最大效能。由于组织—技术领导方面的缺陷，新机器的停歇现象在我们矿井中还是很大。使用像“顿巴斯”康拜因这样著名的机器，也常常没有发生很大的生产效能。我们的任务就是要更坚持地采用“循环生产时间图表制”作业法，更广泛地推广先进工人和整个集体的经验。
    使各个坑道中的辅助工作机械化对于提高矿工的劳动生产率也具有重大的意义。例如在我们这里，几乎百分之十五的装煤和挖煤工人都在从事切煤的准备工作。煤炭工业部应立即采取措施使切煤工作机械化——制造和使用在倾斜煤层和陡削煤层中进行这类切煤工作的机器。这会使从事准备工作的矿工的劳动生产率获得提高，从而提高全体矿工的劳动生产率。
    矿井上的工作是一种最费力的工作。在我厂的许多矿井中，全体工人的百分之二十在从事矿井上的工作。他们的劳动生产率是低的。矿井上工作的机械化程度远远落后于在矿井中的劳动过程的机械化。在煤炭工业已表现了巨大的技术进步的时候，如果对一小部分工作的机械化不给以适当的注意，就会阻碍全部劳动生产率的提高。
    我们的一些矿井中的个别经济工作者和工会人员仍在对社会主义生产竞赛的领导采取形式主义的态度。他们常常把在这一重要问题上自己的工作缩小为仅仅限于制订社会主义生产合同，而不关心于推广先进经验和带动落后者。各个矿井和各个矿工间所订的社会主义生产合同照例只是偶而检查一次，或竟根本不检查。我们的迫切任务是要克服这些重要的缺点，动员广大的劳动群众来完成和超额完成新的五年计划并全力支持那些在努力增加煤的开采量、提高劳动生产率和降低开采燃料的成本中的革新者和先进者。在一切工段坚持执行节约制度
    “劳动报”九月九日发表以“在一切工段，坚持执
    行节约制度”为题的社论，该文指出节约的重要性及
    其意义。摘要如下：
    降低生产品的成本是积累的最重要的泉源。提高劳动生产率、降低原料、物资、燃料和每个生产品所使用的电力的消费量，很好地使用装备，缩减杂费，这就是保证竞赛参加者成功的基本道路和方法。去年一年内，劳动人民因降低工业生产品成本而为国家节省了二百六十亿以上的卢布。
    节约制度不是短期间内的运动。争取降低生产品成本的斗争，争取提高工厂、矿山和国营农场的赢利的斗争，争取完成和超额完成积蓄的计划的斗争，应当经常成为经济组织和职工会组织的注意中心。在各处和一切方面都要进行节约。必须坚决制止对财政纪律的破坏行为，加强对工资基金支出的监督，以完成和超额完成劳动生产率增长的计划，和精简管理机构的方法，来保证正确地使用工资基金。
    实行节约制度与争取提高生产品质量的斗争、与改善劳动组织和生产技术的斗争是分不开的。节约—不仅是要节省物资、工具、原料、电力，而且要争取使用更完善的劳动方法，争取最大可能地使用技术和采用先进的制造法，争取广泛地和有计划地采用生产革新者的经验。也就是说要更广泛地展开争取出产优等质量生产品的竞赛。
    精简节约应当成为每个企业、建筑工程、矿山、每个苏联人工作中不变的规则。职工会和经济领导者的职责，就是教育全体工作人员节省社会财产和人民财富，更广泛地展开对浪费的批评，认真地支持一切导向扩大社会主义积蓄和进一步巩固我们祖国威力的有价值的倡议。
