Anshan Iron and Steel Company Holds Advanced Producer Representatives Conference to Exchange Advanced Experiences and Mobilize Workers to Do a Good Job in Basic Construction

In order to welcome the large-scale economic construction in the coming year, the basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a conference of advanced producer representatives from November 11th to 13th to summarize and exchange advanced experiences and mobilize all employees to further study advanced Soviet technology and do a good job in basic construction.

Anshan Iron and Steel's planned workload this year is more than five times greater than the actual workload completed last year, and the technical level requirements are also very high. The types of work are very complex. In addition, the lack of experience, late start, and short construction time make it relatively difficult to complete the tasks on schedule. However, with the specific guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, all employees have brought their enthusiasm and creativity into play, learned and created many advanced experiences, overcome difficulties in their work, and accelerated the progress of the project. The two main construction sites of Anshan Iron and Steel, in September and October, both overfulfilled their monthly plans, ensuring the on-schedule completion of the entire project.

In the past six months, a total of 304 advanced producers have emerged in civil engineering, mechanical installation, electrical installation, metal structure, furnace construction plant, design department, geological department, residential engineering department, simple housing department, and various management departments, and they have all been rewarded at this conference.

The advanced experiences reported at the conference can be roughly divided into three categories according to their characteristics. The first category is advanced construction and production management methods—assembly line operation method. The characteristic of this method is to conduct thorough preparatory work before construction, improve labor organization, and implement specialized division of labor. The benefit is that it can ensure quality, improve labor efficiency, and train technicians. For example, the Wang Jinzhong concrete engineering team in foundation construction adopted a circular assembly line operation method and a slurry rolling method for pouring concrete, which increased labor efficiency by an average of 136% and ensured first-class quality. The team exceeded its engineering tasks by 24% in August, 52% in September, and completed its tasks 11 days ahead of schedule in October.

Another example is the carpentry factory, which learned the Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line operation method and developed it into a segmented, dedicated, marked, large assembly line operation method. On this basis, it improved and created new tools, gradually moving the carpentry factory from handicraft production to mechanization. In September, the task of making 8,000 windows would have required 8,000 workdays by hand, but due to partial mechanization of operations, it was completed with only 1,000 workdays.

The second category is the advanced experience of combining labor and technology, especially implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts to ensure project quality. For example, in mechanical installation engineering, the installation of anchor bolts and fixed frames used the old Japanese method in the past, which was both labor-intensive and difficult to guarantee quality. The Zhang Jiaming team learned advanced Soviet methods, first fixing the fixed frame according to the benchmark point before pouring the cement, and then welding the anchor bolts to the fixed frame, and pouring the anchor bolts into the foundation when pouring the cement. Using this advanced method, the team installed anchor bolts for seven foundations in forty days, with an average quality of over 98% qualified, and the quality of two of the foundations reached 100% qualified. Labor efficiency was more than doubled compared to the past. Another example is Hu Zhaosen, a technician from the power section, who actively implemented the suggestions of experts, conducted technical education for workers, and cooperated closely with workers, so that the installation project of the blast turbine reached the advanced Soviet standards.

The third category is advanced experiences in inventing and creating tools, improving operating methods, and preparing conditions for future construction mechanization. For example, the Lü Baofang team invented tools such as pipe expanders and pipe sweeping machines in the installation of cable pipelines, increasing the average installation from 7 to 8 meters per worker to more than 30 meters, and improving the quality from 80% qualified to over 95% qualified. The Zhuang Jiqing class created an advanced riveting method. Other classes riveted 400 rivets a day, but they riveted 700 rivets a day. The Liu Zhenju piping team improved the operation method of soldering the joints of water pipes, increasing efficiency by 20 times. Wang Qihua, a technician from the Electrical Installation Company's repair shop, and worker Du Zhongxi successfully manufactured a double-headed welding machine and a six-headed welding machine, which solved the urgent need for installation engineering tasks at that time.

Regarding the question of how to further study and promote advanced experiences in the future, Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Yimin, Director of the Political Department of Basic Construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, proposed at the meeting: First of all, leading cadres at all levels are required to conduct a general review of the past organization of learning from Soviet experts, implementing expert suggestions, and promoting advanced experiences, conduct criticism and self-criticism, make summaries, and establish systems, and treat this work as an important task at present. Secondly, during the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, it is necessary to conduct universal and in-depth education among employees, mobilize each employee to review how much advanced experience they have learned in this year's work, and formulate future learning plans. In carrying out this work, it is necessary to criticize conservative and backward ideas, commend and reward those who have achieved good results in learning advanced experiences, and continue to promote this work further.

### 鞍山钢铁公司召开基本建设先进生产者代表大会  交流先进经验动员职工搞好基本建设

　　鞍山钢铁公司召开基本建设先进生产者代表大会
    交流先进经验动员职工搞好基本建设
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门为了迎接明年的大规模经济建设，于十一月十一日至十三日召开了先进生产者代表大会，总结和交流先进经验，并动员全体职工进一步学习苏联先进技术，搞好基本建设。
    鞍钢今年的计划工作量比去年实际完成的工作量多五倍多，技术水平还要求很高，工种很复杂；加上经验缺乏、开工较迟、施工时间短促，按期完成任务是比较困难的。但是全体职工在苏联专家具体指导与帮助下，发挥了积极性与创造性，学习并创造了许多先进经验，战胜了工作中的困难，加速了工程进度。鞍钢的两个主要工地，九、十两个月都超额完成了月计划，使整个工程任务按期完成有了把握。
    半年来，总计在土木建筑、机械安装、电气安装、金属结构、筑炉厂、设计处、地质处、住宅工程处、简易住宅处，以及各管理部门中，共涌现了先进生产者三百零四名，在这次大会上都分别受到了奖励。
    这次在会上所报告的先进经验，根据其特点，大体可分为三类。第一类是先进的施工与生产管理方法——流水作业法。这种方法的特点是在施工前进行周密的准备工作，改善劳动组织，实行分工专业化；好处是可以保证质量，提高劳动效率，培养技工。如在基础筑造方面的王进忠混凝土工程队，采用浇灌混凝土的循环流水作业法和滚浆法，使劳动效率平均提高百分之一百三十六，并保证了一等质量。该队八月份工程任务超过百分之二十四，九月份任务超过百分之五十二，十月份提前十一天完成了任务。
    又如木工厂学习谢万福木工流水作业法，并加以发展成为分段专责记号大流水作业法，并在这个基础上改进与创造了新的工具，使木工厂由手工业生产逐步走向机械化。九月份承做八千扇窗的任务，用手工需八千个工，由于部分操作机械化，只一千工就完成了。
    第二类是劳动与技术结合，特别是贯彻苏联专家的建议，保证工程质量的先进经验。如在机械安装工程方面，地脚螺丝、固定架的安装，过去是用日本旧法，既费工又难保证质量。张甲明小组学习苏联先进方法，在打洋灰之前先按着基准点友好固定架，然后把地脚螺丝焊在固定架上，打洋灰时把地脚螺丝浇灌在基础之内。该组运用这一先进方法，在四十天当中，安装了七个基础的地脚螺丝，平均质量百分之九十八以上合格，其中有两个基础质量达到百分之百合格，劳动效率比过去提高一倍以上。又如动电工段技术员胡兆森，积极贯彻专家建议，对工人进行技术教育，与工人密切配合，使鼓风透平的安装工程达到苏联的先进标准。
    第三类是发明创造工具，改进操作方法，给今后施工机械化准备了条件的先进经验。如吕宝芳小组在电缆管道安装工作中，发明了?f管器、扫管机等工具，从原来每工平均安装七到八公尺提高到三十公尺以上，质量由百分之八十合格提高到百分之九十五以上合格。庄吉庆班创造了先进的铆钉法，别的班一天铆四百钉，他们一天铆七百钉。刘振举配管组改进水道管接头挂锡皮的操作法，提高效率达二十倍。电装公司修配厂技术员王启华与工人杜忠喜制造双头电焊机及六头电焊机成功，解决了当时安装工程任务的急需。
    对于今后如何进一步学习与推广先进经验的问题，中共鞍山市委书记韩天石与鞍钢基本建设政治部主任张益民在会上提出：首先要求各级领导干部普遍检查过去组织向苏联专家学习、贯彻专家建议及推广先进经验的情况，开展批评与自我批评，做出总结，建立制度，把这项工作当成目前的重要工作来做。其次，在中苏友好月中，要在职工中进行普遍深入的教育，发动每个职工检查在今年工作中学习了多少先进经验，订出今后的学习计划。在进行这项工作中，要批判保守的落后的思想，表扬和奖励学习先进经验成绩好的，将这一项工作继续向前推进一步。
