Xinhua News Agency, Moscow (TASS dispatch)

The war launched by the American imperialists in Korea has been going on for about thirty months. Large numbers of men, women, and children have been massacred and maimed, and countless Korean cities and villages have been burned down by the American air force. The civilian population has suffered unprecedented hardship and misery – this is what the shameless aggression wantonly carried out by the American interventionists has inflicted on the Korean people.

Following in the footsteps of the Hitler dictatorship, the American occupiers are carrying out unprecedented atrocities in Korea. But no amount of atrocities committed by the interventionists can shake the high morale of the heroic Korean people, who are valiantly defending their freedom and the independence of their motherland. With the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the peace-loving Korean people are fighting for a just cause.

The Soviet Union, which has consistently upheld the cause of peace, has continuously striven for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Korea since its very beginning. The proposal that became the basis for the Korean armistice negotiations was put forward by the Soviet side.

It has been more than sixteen months since the negotiations began. But an agreement has still not been reached, and blood continues to flow on Korean soil. So, what is preventing a ceasefire and the conclusion of an armistice agreement?

The official spokesmen of the Anglo-American aggressive bloc and the journalistic lackeys of Wall Street have perhaps never fabricated so many lies on this issue in an attempt to shift the responsibility for sabotaging a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem onto others. However, millions upon millions of people in all countries know that the responsibility for the continuation of the Korean War rests entirely with the American ruling circles.

During the armistice negotiations, the American representatives, presumptuously calling themselves the "United Nations delegation," spared no effort to sabotage the negotiations. But neither provocations, intimidation, military pressure, nor slanderous propaganda in the newspapers could satisfy Washington's wishes. Thanks to the calm and firm attitude shown by the Korean and Chinese sides, who have consistently striven to end the war, almost all the clauses of the armistice agreement were agreed upon by the spring of this year, thus providing a real possibility for ending the war.

But this was precisely what the American ruling circles, who launched the Korean War, feared most. Trying to obstruct the end of the war, the US side deliberately created a new obstacle, refusing to resolve the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with existing international treaties.

The immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement is one of the fundamental principles of international law. This principle has a long history, and the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War reaffirmed it. But the American ruling circles regard this international agreement signed by the United States, as well as other international agreements, as "scraps of paper." Washington politicians decided to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and in order to deceive world opinion, they began to clamor for so-called "voluntary repatriation." "Voluntary repatriation," "non-forcible repatriation," and "non-forcible repatriation" are, in fact, different names for the conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

It took a long time for the world to see through such hypocrisy. Tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are being tortured and brutally killed in the torture chambers of Koje Island, Busan, Jeju Island, and other American "death camps," while those who ordered this are posing as the "protectors" of the prisoners of war! US Secretary of State Acheson and other American representatives attending the Seventh United Nations General Assembly are pontificating about the principles of law, morality, and humanity, trying to force the Assembly to accept the proposals they have been instructed to put forward. These proposals have only one purpose: to approve the illegal act of the US military command in detaining tens of thousands of prisoners of war.

The statement issued today by the Korean Central News Agency, published in today's *Pravda*, once again demonstrates that those on the other side of the Atlantic who propagate a "humane attitude" towards prisoners of war are guilty of the heinous crime of deceiving world opinion. It is already known that in May 1951, four hundred prisoners of war were secretly transported to the United States to be used as test subjects for atomic weapons. In May of this year, prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camp number 77 who requested repatriation were used as test subjects for a new type of flamethrower; eight hundred prisoners of war were burned alive by American demons.

It is perfectly clear that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposed by the US side serves only one purpose: to sabotage the armistice negotiations and prolong the Korean War.

The criminal policy pursued by the American ruling circles on the Korean issue is based on the greedy and selfish calculations of American billionaires and millionaires. The specter of economic crisis is threatening the United States. American industrial production has not yet declined sharply only because the aggression against the Korean people has greatly increased the production of armaments and intensified the expansion of armaments. This is why the American financial tycoons are so afraid of peace and so eager to continue the Korean War.

American manufacturers and bankers are reaping huge profits from the bloodshed and suffering of the Korean people. In the first year of the Korean War, they had already profited 23 billion US dollars from this war. These profits have increased since then.

American liberal journalist Stone, in analyzing the position of the American ruling circles, wrote: They are afraid of peace, and when this massacre stops, they will lose confidence; they seem like a despicable madman who can only restrain the trembling in his heart when he is killing and committing violence... Stone went on to say: The American ruling circles base all their plans on the assumption that negotiations will fail.

As for the American military authorities—those faithful servants of the Wall Street "merchants of death"—they believe that the Korean War can be used to seize an important strategic springboard in the Far East in order to launch new military gambles. American military leaders are training a batch of murderers and robbers in the Korean battlefield as "personnel" in preparation for attacking the people of other peace-loving countries. It is no accident that the US military command referred to an important battle they conducted in Korea as a "war of attrition."

General Ridgway, in explaining the hateful and inhumane goals that the United States hopes to achieve in this war, declared that the main thing is to kill as many Chinese and Koreans as possible. In this way, it seems that the American imperialists are completely unmoved when they promote the atrocities they have committed in Korea under the banner of the United Nations.

The vicious aggression launched by the American aggressors against the peace-loving Korean people has exposed to millions of people their sinister intention to create another war. The unanimous demand of progressive humanity, "Stop the Korean War immediately!" is being shouted louder and louder in all countries and in all languages.

In its policy, the Soviet Union embodies the vital interests of all peoples and their desire for peace. The Soviet Union has consistently striven for the immediate cessation of the Korean War. A few days ago, the Soviet delegation to the Seventh United Nations General Assembly proposed an amendment to its proposal on the Korean issue. This amendment stipulates an immediate and complete ceasefire based on the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by the belligerent parties, that is, the two sides cease military action on land, at sea, and in the air, and the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war is handed over to the commission for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue as stipulated in the Soviet proposal for resolution.

American bourgeois newspapers attempt to conceal these suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union, thereby unintentionally proving how opposed their masters are to a Korean armistice. But these efforts have not succeeded. The truth cannot be concealed! People clearly see that the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as the efforts of the entire peace camp, are all aimed at ending the Korean War. The statement issued today by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, once again eloquently proves this. At the same time, the conspiracies and tricks of Washington politicians can in no way conceal from world public opinion the undeniable fact that the American ruling circles are determined to prolong and expand the Korean War.

    朝鲜战争为什么在拖下去
    ——苏联“真理报”十一月二十九日社论
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动的战争已进行约三十个月了。大批男女和儿童被屠杀和残害，成千上万的朝鲜城市和乡村被美国空军烧毁，平民遭受空前的困难和苦难——这就是美国干涉者无端进行的无耻侵略所加诸朝鲜人民的。
    美国占领者步希特勒独裁政权的后尘，正在朝鲜干着史无前例的暴行。但干涉者所干的任何暴行都动摇不了正英勇地保卫他们的自由和祖国独立的英雄朝鲜人民的高昂民气。爱好和平的朝鲜人民正在中国人民志愿军的支持下，为一个正义的事业而斗争。
    一贯维护和平事业的苏联，自朝鲜的武装冲突一开始时起，就不断努力谋求它的和平解决。成为朝鲜停战谈判的基础的建议就是苏联方面提出的。
    自从谈判开始以来，已经有十六个多月了。但协议仍未达成，鲜血仍在朝鲜国土上流着。那么，阻碍停火和缔结停战协定的是什么呢？
    美英侵略集团的官方发言人和华尔街的报界走狗也许从来没有像在这个问题上捏造过这么多的谎言，以图把破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的责任转嫁于他人。可是，各国成千成万的老百姓都知道，朝鲜战争继续进行的责任，是完全要由美国统治集团来负的。
    在停战谈判期间，妄自称为“联合国代表团”的美国代表不遗余力地破坏谈判，但挑衅、威吓、军事压力以及报纸的诽谤宣传，都未使华盛顿如愿以偿。由于一贯努力谋求结束战争的朝中方面表现了沉着和坚定的态度，停战协定各条款乃能在本年春天差不多全部达成协议，从而为结束战争提供了真正的可能性。
    但这恰是发动朝鲜战争的美国统治集团所最害怕的。力图阻挠结束战争的美方，故意制造一个新障碍，拒绝按照现行的国际条约解决遣返战俘的问题。
    停战协定签字后立即遣返全部战俘回家一点，是国际法的基本原则之一，这个原则由来已久，一九四九年关于战俘问题的日内瓦公约又把它再度确定下来。但美国统治集团把美国所签字的这个国际协定和其他国际协定看作是“一张废纸”。华盛顿政客决定强迫扣留战俘，而为了欺骗世界舆论，便开始叫嚣所谓“自愿遣返”。“自愿遣返”、“不强迫遣返”及“不用武力遣返”等说法，事实上是强迫扣留战俘这一阴谋的不同名称。
    世人在很长一个时候未看穿这样一种伪善态度。成千上万的朝中战俘正在巨济岛、釜山、济州岛及美方其他“死亡营”的酷刑室中遭受折磨和被残酷地弄死，而下令这样干的人却装成是战俘的“保卫者”！美国国务卿艾奇逊和美国出席第七届联合国大会的其他代表正在侈谈法律、道德和人道原则，要强使大会接受他们授意提出的提案。这些提案只有一个目的：批准美军司令部的扣留数万战俘的非法行为。
    真理报今天所发表的朝鲜中央通讯社的声明，再度说明大西洋彼岸的宣传对战俘采取“人道态度”的人，犯有欺骗世界舆论的滔天罪行。人们已经知道，在一九五一年五月，四百名战俘被秘密地运往美国作为原子武器的试验品。在今年五月，在第七十七号俘虏营中有要求遣返回家的战俘被用来作为一种新型火焰放射器的试验品；八百名战俘被美国恶魔活活地烧死了。
    十分清楚，美方所提出的所谓“自愿遣返”，只抱有一个目的：破坏停战谈判，把朝鲜战争拖下去。
    美国统治集团在朝鲜问题上所遵循的罪恶政策，是以美国亿万富翁和百万富翁的贪婪自私的打算为基础的。经济危机的魔鬼正在威胁着美国。美国工业生产之所以尚未剧烈下降，仅仅是由于因对朝鲜人民进行侵略战争而大大增加了军火生产，和加紧扩张军备的原故。这就是美国财阀这样害怕和平而极想继续进行朝鲜战争的原因。
    美国制造商和银行家正从朝鲜人民的流血和苦难中掠取庞大的利润。在朝鲜战争的第一年中，他们已从这个战争中获利二百三十亿美元。以后这些利润又有增加。
    美国自由派记者史东在分析美国统治集团的立场时写道：他们害怕和平，当这场屠杀停止时，他们就要丧失信心；他们好像一个可鄙的疯子一样，只有在杀人和行凶的时候才能遏止自己内心的战抖……。史东接着说：美国统治集团把他们的一切计划都建筑在谈判将会失败这样一个假定上。
    至于美国军事当局——那些华尔街“死亡商人”的忠实仆从，他们认为朝鲜战争可以用来夺取远东的一个重要战略跳板，以便发动新的军事赌博。美国军事首领们正在朝鲜战场上训练一批凶手和强盗
    一类的“人员”，准备进攻其他爱好和平的国家的人民。美军司令部把他们在朝鲜进行的一次重要战斗称为“杀伤战”，这决不是偶然的。
    李奇微将军在说明美国在这场战争中希望达到的仇视人类的目标时宣称，主要的事情是杀死尽可能多的中国人和朝鲜人。这样看来，美帝国主义者在宣传他们打着联合国的旗子在朝鲜所犯的暴行时，是完全无动于衷的。
    美国侵略者对爱好和平的朝鲜人民发动的恶毒进攻，向千百万人民揭露了他们制造另一次战争的凶恶目的。进步人类的一致要求“立即停止朝鲜战争！”已在一切国家用一切语言喊得愈来愈响了。
    苏联在它的政策中表现了一切人民的切身利益以及他们的和平愿望，苏联始终一贯地为立即停止朝鲜战争而努力。几天以前，出席第七届联合国大会的苏联代表团提出了对它所提的关于朝鲜问题的提案的修正案。这个修正案规定根据交战的双方已经同意的停战协定草案实行立即的、完全的停火，即双方停止陆上、海上和空中的军事行动，全部遣返战俘问题交给苏联提案中所规定的和平解决朝鲜问题的委员会加以解决。
    美国资产阶级报纸企图隐瞒苏联所提的这些建议，这样他们就无意中证明了他们的主子是多么反对朝鲜停战。但是这些努力都没有成功。真理是掩盖不了的！人们清楚地看到苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的努力以及整个和平阵营的努力都是为了结束朝鲜战争。今天刊载的中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来的声明又一次雄辩地证明了这一点。同时，华盛顿的政客们的阴谋诡计绝对无法向全世界公众掩饰一个不容置疑的事实，就是美国统治集团一心想拖延和扩大朝鲜战争。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科电）
