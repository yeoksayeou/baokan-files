    Preparing Conditions for Large-Scale Construction
    A Large Number of New Products Successfully Trial-Manufactured in Northeast China
    Over the past three years, under the guidance of advanced Soviet technology, state-owned industries in Northeast China have successfully trial-manufactured a large number of new products. This is of great significance for the upcoming large-scale economic construction nationwide.
    In the machinery industry, more than 400 new products have been successfully trial-manufactured in the past three years. General lathes, 106mm precision boring machines, 1.5-meter herringbone gear planers, machine tools such as the 2121 Soviet vertical drills, 500-meter and 300-meter drilling rigs, and mining machinery such as magnetic separators can now be manufactured. Currently, the trial manufacture of several types of Soviet-style lathes, universal milling machines, and 3-meter herringbone gear planers is underway. Large machines such as 5-meter vertical lathes, 9-meter gantry planers, 5-meter spiral milling machines, and 5-ton steam hammers, as well as mining equipment such as 5-meter helical gears and 4-meter herringbone gear accessories, have been successfully trial-manufactured and are now being manufactured. These new products not only supply the needs of the Northeast, but some are also shipped to other factories and mines within the customs. The successful trial manufacture of small locomotives for the forestry industry and special products such as silicon carbide, alumina, and corundum will also play a significant role in the development of industry.
    The electrical industry is also developing at the same pace. A total of more than 400 new products have been trial-manufactured in the past three years. In terms of power generation equipment, following the successful trial manufacture of 800-kilowatt hydro-generators and 3,000-kilowatt generators, the trial manufacture of 6,000-kilowatt generators is now underway. In terms of substation and distribution equipment, large 5,000 kVA transformers and 6,900-volt high-voltage oil circuit breakers can now be manufactured. The manufacture of 20,000 kVA and 154,000-volt high-voltage transformers is currently underway. Only 50 kW motors could be made during the puppet Manchukuo period, but now 600 kW six-pole motors can be manufactured, and the trial manufacture of 750 kW eight-pole and 1,400 kW four-pole AC generators and other measuring instruments is being prepared.
    In terms of steel, several special steels can now be self-made. The production of cold-drawn ball bearing steel, 1-8 cm small-sized ball bearing steel, and hard alloys are all innovations in our country. Turbine blade steel, which could not be solved during the Japanese puppet era, and low-silicon steelmaking pig iron, which imperialists believed could not be manufactured from Anshan ore, have also been successfully produced with the help of Soviet experts.
    In terms of non-ferrous metals, distilled zinc, which failed repeatedly during the Japanese puppet era, has been successfully produced, and the technology of electrolytic zinc production has been mastered. Refractory materials needed for metal smelting can now also be made by ourselves.
    In the building materials industry, the production of mixed cement and ordinary cement with mixed materials has greatly increased cement production; lightweight glass (foam glass), a roofing material for large factories, has also been successfully trial-manufactured and is being prepared for mass production. Other products such as tempered glass and internal combustion engine spark plugs can also be manufactured by ourselves.
    In the petroleum industry, the technologies of synthetic petroleum and high-pressure hydrogenation have now been mastered, which had been trial-manufactured unsuccessfully several times during the Japanese puppet era.
    In light industry, phosphobronze wire, an important equipment for the papermaking industry, has been successfully manufactured and is now being prepared for expanded production. Many new products of significant importance have also emerged in the rubber industry.
    The trial manufacture and mass production of new products are carried out under imperfect equipment conditions. New technologies need to be adopted in the complex production process. However, the working class in Northeast China learned and adopted advanced Soviet science and technology, and brought their high intelligence into play, and finally overcame all difficulties and successfully completed the trial manufacture and manufacturing tasks of new products. Products trial-manufactured according to Soviet technical standards save materials and labor, and are of good quality.
    However, at present, the trial manufacture of new products has not attracted the attention of leading cadres of all enterprises in the Northeast, and the existing achievements are still far from enough, and need to be further strengthened in the future.

    为大规模建设准备条件
    东北大批新产品试制成功
    三年来，东北国营工业在苏联先进技术指导下，试制成功了大批新产品。这对即将开始的全国大规模经济建设有很重要的意义。
    在机械工业方面，三年来试制成功的新产品共有四百多种。一般车床、一零六公厘的精密摚床、一点五公尺的人字牙刨、二一二一苏联立钻等工作母机、五百公尺及三百公尺的钻探机、磁选机等矿山机械，现在都已能制造。目前正在进行试制的有数种苏联型车床、万能铣及三公尺人字牙刨；试制成功，已经开始制造的有五公尺立旋、九公尺龙门刨、五公尺镙旋铣、五吨汽锤等大型机器及矿山用五公尺正斜齿轮、四公尺人字牙轮配件等。这些新产品不仅供应了东北的需要，有些并输送给了关内其他厂矿。其他如森林工业用的小型机车和特殊炭化矽、氧化铝、金钢砂等产品的试造成功，对工业的发展都将起很大作用。
    电器工业也以同样速度发展着。三年来一共试制了四百多种新产品。在发电设备上，继八百瓩水轮发电机和三千瓩发电机试制成功后，目前正着手试制六千瓩发电机。在变电、配电设备上，现已能制造五千千伏安的大型变压器和六千九百伏特的高压油断路器。目前正着手制造两万千伏安、十五万四千伏特的高压变压器。伪满时候只能做五十瓩电动机，目前已能制造六百瓩六极电动机；并准备试制七百五十瓩八极和一千四百瓩四极的交流发电机和其它若干计器。
    在钢铁方面，好些特殊钢已能自制。如冷拔滚珠钢、一至八公分小尺寸滚珠钢材，以及硬质合金的生产，在我国都属创举。在日伪时代所不能解决的透平汽叶钢和帝国主义者认为鞍山矿石不能制造的低矽制钢生铁，也在苏联专家帮助下胜利制成。
    在有色金属方面，日伪时代制造而屡遭失败的蒸溜锌已经制成，同时掌握了电解制锌技术。配合金属冶炼需要的耐火材料，现在自己也都能制了。
    在建筑材料工业方面，由于制造了混合水泥和加混合材料的普通水泥，使水泥产量大大提高；大型厂房用的屋顶建筑材料——轻量玻璃（泡沫玻璃）我们也已试制成功，正准备大量生产。其他如钢化玻璃和内燃机点火栓都能自己制造了。
    在石油工业方面，现已掌握了合成石油和高压加氢的技术，这些在日伪时代都是几经试制而未成功的。
    在轻工业方面，造纸工业的重要器材——磷青铜长网已制造成功，现正准备扩大生产。橡胶工业中也出现了不少有重要意义的新产品。
    新产品的试制和大量制造，是在设备条件不完善的情况下进行的。在复杂的生产过程中，需要采用新的技术。但是，东北工人阶级学习和采用了苏联先进科学技术，发挥了高度的智慧，终于克服了一切困难，胜利地完成了新产品的试制和制造任务。按照苏联技术标准试制的产品，又省材料又省工，质量还好。
    但是，目前新产品试制工作还未引起东北所有企业领导干部重视，现有的成就还很不够，需要在今后进一步加强。
