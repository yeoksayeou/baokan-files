    North China Farmers Actively Prepare for Next Year's Great Production
    Autumn Ploughing Nears Ninety Percent of Plantable Area
    In order to continue improving yield per unit area, farmers in various parts of North China have been actively preparing for next year's great production since the autumn harvest. By the beginning of this month, the area of autumn-ploughed land in the provinces of North China was close to ninety percent of the plantable area, and many areas have also increased the depth and number of ploughing passes. In the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, more than 260,000 mu of autumn land in nine counties, including Jincheng and Pingshun, have been ploughed twice. According to statistics from 30 counties in four special districts, including Ding County and Tianjin in Hebei Province, of the more than 16.54 million mu of autumn land that has been ploughed, 5.51 million mu have been ploughed two to three times. In Hebei Province, autumn land is generally ploughed to a depth of five to six inches, which is more than one inch deeper than last year. In Shanxi Province, autumn land is generally ploughed to a depth of four to five inches.
    New-style walking plows have been vigorously promoted in the autumn ploughing in various provinces of North China. In many areas, farmers have learned to use new-style walking plows through labor model conferences, technical instruction stations, and technical training classes. Four hundred labor models who participated in the Ding County Labor Model Conference in Hebei Province deeply experienced the benefits of deep ploughing and careful cultivation from the exchange of production experience. After the conference, more than 130 labor models immediately bought back 138 new-style walking plows. Shanxi Province also promoted 8,999 new-style walking plows in September and October.
    During autumn ploughing, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various provinces of North China actively applied basal fertilizer. The Jia Wenwu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beihuyan Village, Pingding County, Shanxi Province, applied 100 dan of basal fertilizer per mu to 60 mu of autumn fields. In the first district of Pingshun County, basal fertilizer was applied to more than 10,000 mu of autumn land during autumn ploughing. Lixian County in Hebei Province also mobilized women to pick up insect eggs, remove weeds, and collect straw stalks with the plows, removing more than 700,000 jin of weeds alone. In sixteen villages in Laishui and Tang County, more than 1,200 women and children were mobilized to collect 150,000 pupae and 263,000 jin of straw stalks. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北农民积极为明年大生产作准备
    秋耕地已接近应耕地面积百分之九十
    为继续提高单位面积产量，华北各地农民秋收后就积极地进行明年大生产的准备工作。到本月初，华北各省秋耕地的面积已近应耕地的百分之九十，不少地区还增加了耕作的深度和遍数。山西省长治专区的晋城、平顺等九个县的秋地，耕过两遍的就有二十六万多亩。河北省定县、天津等四个专区三十个县统计：已耕的一千六百五十四万余亩秋地中，耕两遍到三遍的达五百五十一万余亩。河北省秋地都深耕达五寸到六寸，比去年加深一寸多。山西省秋地深耕一般也有四寸到五寸。
    华北各省在秋耕中都大力推广了新式步犁。不少地区经过劳动模范大会、技术传授站和技术训练班，使农民学会使用新式步犁。河北定县参加县劳动模范大会的四百名劳动模范，从交流生产经验中深刻体验到深耕细作的好处，会后有一百三十多名劳动模范立即买回新式步犁一百三十八部。山西省在九、十两月也推广新式步犁八千九百九十九部。
    在秋耕中，华北各省有不少农业生产合作社和互助组都积极补施底肥。山西省平定县北虎岩村贾文武农业生产合作社的六十亩秋田，每亩施底肥一百担；平顺县一区有一万多亩秋地，在秋耕中施了底肥。河北省蠡县还发动妇女随犁拾虫卵、除杂草、拾禾茬，光除杂草就有七十多万斤；涞水、唐县十六个村发动妇女、儿童一千二百多人，拾蛹十五万个，拾禾茬二十六万三千斤。　（新华社）
