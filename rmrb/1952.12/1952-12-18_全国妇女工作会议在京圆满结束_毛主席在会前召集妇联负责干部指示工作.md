The conference analyzed the women's work of the past two years, affirmed the work achievements, and especially focused on studying the specific problems in the work. In response to these problems, the conference put forward the key points of the future tasks of women's work, which are: (1) To strengthen the political and cultural education of the masses of women in a planned way, and to eliminate the feudal residual ideas existing among the masses of women and even women cadres, especially the ideas and consciousness of dependence, conservatism, and contempt for labor; (2) Women should fight together with people of all strata to further eliminate feudal residual ideas and customs, and remove obstacles for women to participate in production and learning; (3) Vigorously develop maternal and child health and childcare work to meet the needs of national economic and cultural construction. The conference also discussed urban women workers' work and work relating to workers' families, women's participation in production and employment, women's work in the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and maternal and child health and childcare work.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks and specific work, the conference believes that: first of all, it is necessary to strengthen the political and professional study of women's work cadres, actively train cadres, and improve the work system to strengthen the leadership of women's federations at all levels, and to consolidate grassroots organizations so that they can adapt to the needs of production, give full play to their organizational role, and become fighting organizations that safeguard women's rights and interests. Secondly, work methods should be improved. In the work, we must be good at obtaining the leadership of the Party, be good at summarizing experience, be good at caring for the masses and relying on the strength of the masses, and also be good at reminding and urging relevant parties to jointly do a good job in women's work.

    这次会议是在毛主席和中共中央的关怀和指导下举行的。开会前，毛主席亲自召集了全国妇联主要负责干部谈话，对妇女工作作了重要的指示。会议期间，中央人民政府政务院邓小平副总理在会上作了政治报告。中央人民政府民族事务委员会李维汉主任委员作了关于民族政策的报告。

    两年来，全国妇女群众已基本上组织起来，在各种运动和国家建设中起了重大的作用，妇女群众的政治水平和文化水平已大大提高了，她们在家庭中和在社会上的地位，都有了显著的变化。会议分析了两年来的妇女工作，肯定了工作成绩，特别着重地研究了工作中的具体问题，并针对这些问题，提出了今后妇女工作任务的重点，即是：（一）有计划地加强妇女群众的政治文化教育，清除存在于妇女群众以至妇女干部中的封建残余思想，特别是依赖、保守、轻视劳动等思想意识；（二）妇女应与各阶层人民一道为进一步肃清封建残余思想习俗而斗争，扫除妇女参加生产和学习的障碍；（三）大力展开妇婴卫生儿童保育工作，以适应国家经济、文化建设的需要。会议又分别讨论了城市女工工作和工属工作、妇女参加生产和就业问题、农村互助合作运动中的妇女工作、妇婴卫生和儿童保育工作。会上还传达了中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法的指示，并要求各地妇联积极协助各地党组织在今冬明春做好贯彻婚姻法的准备工作。
    为了保证上述任务和具体工作的完成，会议认为：首先必须加强妇女工作干部的政治和业务学习，积极训练干部，健全工作制度，以加强各级妇联的领导，并整顿基层组织，使其适应生产的需要，充分发挥组织作用，成为维护妇女权益的战斗组织。其次应改进工作方法，在工作中要善于取得党的领导，善于总结经验，善于关心群众并依靠群众的力量，还要善于提醒和督促有关方面共同来做好妇女工作。
