    The North China Bureau Propaganda Department Convenes a Conference on Propaganda in Factories and Mines
    Discussing Propaganda Work in Factories and Mines for Large-Scale Economic Construction

    The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the second conference on propaganda in factories and mines in late October. It clearly pointed out the changes that should occur in propaganda work in factories and mines on the eve of large-scale economic construction.

    Before the start of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in July this year, the propaganda work in factories and mines in the North China region mainly served the political reform movements. The propaganda in various political reform movements enhanced the workers' political consciousness and strengthened their enthusiasm and creativity in labor, thus initially promoting production reform. At present, the various political reform tasks in factories and mines are about to basically end, and the national large-scale economic construction is about to begin. Therefore, the propaganda work in factories and mines must move forward to adapt to the new situation.

    The meeting believes that promoting advanced experiences is the central task of industrial and mining enterprises for a long period to come. Therefore, doing a good job in publicizing advanced experiences has become a central link that propaganda work in factories and mines must grasp in order to achieve a new transformation.

    Vigorously publicizing advanced figures and advanced ideas, such as: the patriotic idea of being the master of the country, the idea of mastering advanced technology to be the master of machines, and the idea of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, is of great practical significance in promoting advanced experience. Therefore, guiding employees to consciously compare themselves with advanced ideas is the fundamental method to eliminate conservative ideas among employees and promote their active learning of advanced experience, and it is also a basic task of propaganda work in factories and mines. However, to publicize advanced ideas, we must first correct our views and attitudes towards the working class, and we must see the excellent essence of the working class; we must see that under the leadership and education of the Communist Party in the past three years, the political consciousness of the working class has been greatly improved. If we cannot see this fact, we cannot rely on the working class well and we will make mistakes. Therefore, propaganda workers in each factory and mine must first fully publicize advanced ideas among employees, be good at discovering the seeds of advanced ideas in the specific experiences and practices of employees, summarize and improve them in a timely manner, and use employees' own experiences to educate themselves. With these advanced ideas as the driving force for progress, workers can give full play to their labor enthusiasm and wisdom, take the initiative to overcome difficulties in production, delve into and create new technologies and operating methods, and actively help others learn advanced experience.

    Political propaganda in propaganda work in factories and mines will still be very important in the future, but political propaganda in production must be closely integrated with technical propaganda. Because advanced technology embodies advanced ideas and advanced experience in production, it is impossible to promote advanced experience without technical propaganda. Technical propaganda should generally be combined with the workers' own operational experience to publicize the basic spirit and scientific principles of advanced experience to facilitate employee learning. To carry out technical propaganda, we must mobilize technical personnel to participate, we must implement the Party's policy of uniting and transforming technical personnel, and educate all Party members and workers to recognize the role of technical personnel in production. Educate technical personnel to learn the working methods of the mass line of combining with workers, and lead them to make achievements in production technology, so that they can understand the importance of relying on workers from practice. Thus, they can be transformed. Party propaganda cadres must correct the erroneous view that "technology is the business of administration, and the Party only manages politics." They must learn the necessary production knowledge in their daily production work, so that they can be not only politically advanced, but also technically advanced. In order to meet the needs of the work, propaganda workers should be appropriately developed among technical personnel and skilled workers in the future. In the future, the number of propaganda workers in general factories and mines can be developed to 10% of the total number of employees, and efforts should be made to have a propaganda worker in each production team.

    As for the propaganda of current events and policies (such as major domestic and international events, Sino-Soviet friendship, the worker-peasant alliance, trade, etc.), it must also be closely integrated with production propaganda and firmly grasped, so that employees can correctly understand the development of the situation and the development direction of the factory. Otherwise, there will be a tendency to bury oneself in production and ignore politics. In addition, production propaganda should also pay attention to propaganda on improving quality and ensuring safety. Because emphasizing quality and safety is not only one of the basic characteristics of socialist state-owned enterprises, but also output, quality, safety, cost, etc. are a complete and inseparable part of actual production. If the quality indicators are not met, the output indicators will not actually be met; if safety problems occur, the guarantee of completing the task will inevitably be lost. Therefore, propaganda workers in factories and mines must establish a concept of quality and a concept of safety among the broad masses of employees, and oppose the one-sided propaganda that only blames employees for not following operating procedures without carrying out necessary safety equipment.

    In order to vigorously promote the upcoming large-scale economic construction from a political and ideological perspective, the meeting pointed out that cadres of the Party's propaganda departments must conscientiously study theoretical knowledge about economic construction and the necessary professional knowledge, and there is no longer room for only empty leadership. We must resolutely delve into things we do not understand and learn them well. We must be keenly aware of new things, constantly study and summarize them, and widely create and use new propaganda forms that are both in-depth and lively, so that the propaganda work in industrial and mining enterprises can be done better.

### 华北局宣传部召开工矿宣传会议  讨论大规模经济建设的工矿宣传工作

    华北局宣传部召开工矿宣传会议
    讨论大规模经济建设的工矿宣传工作
    中共中央华北局宣传部曾于十月下旬召开了第二次工矿宣传会议。明确指出了在大规模经济建设前夕工矿宣传工作应有的转变。
    华北区的工矿宣传工作在今年七月增产节约运动开始以前，主要是服务于政治改革运动。在各种政治改革运动的宣传中，提高了工人的政治觉悟，增强了工人劳动的积极性和创造性，因而也初步地推动了生产改革。目前，工矿中的各种政治改革工作即将基本结束，全国大规模的经济建设即将开始，因此，工矿宣传工作必须向前发展一步，以适应新的情况。
    会议认为：推广先进经验是工矿企业今后长时期的中心任务，因此，做好先进经验的宣传工作，就成为工矿宣传工作为实现新的转变而必须抓紧的一个中心环节。
    大力宣传先进人物先进思想，如：做国家主人的爱国主义思想，掌握先进技术做机器主人的思想，学习苏联先进经验的思想，在推广先进经验中有着重大的现实意义。因此诱导职工自觉地把自己和先进思想对照，是扫除职工中保守思想，推动职工积极学习先进经验的根本方法，也是工矿宣传工作的一项基本任务。但是宣传先进思想，首先必须端正对待工人阶级的看法和态度，必须看到工人阶级的优秀本质；看到三年来工人阶级在共产党的领导和教育下，政治觉悟已大为提高。如果看不到这种事实，就不能很好地依靠工人阶级，就会犯错误。所以，每个厂矿的宣传工作者首先必须在职工中充分地进行先进思想的宣传，善于在职工的具体体会和实践中，及时发现先进思想的萌芽，加以总结提高，用职工自己的经验来教育职工自己。工人们有了这种先进思想做为前进的动力，就能高度地发挥劳动热忱和智慧，主动克服生产中的困难，钻研创造新的技术和操作方法，并积极帮助别人学习先进经验。
    工矿宣传工作中的政治宣传在今后仍然十分重要，但生产中的政治宣传必须与技术宣传密切结合。因为先进的技术是在生产中具体体现先进思想和先进经验的，不进行技术宣传，先进经验的推广是不可能的。技术宣传一般应结合工人自己操作的切身经验，宣传先进经验的基本精神与科学道理，以便于职工学习。进行技术宣传，必须发动技术人员参加，必须贯彻党的团结改造技术人员的政策，教育全体党员和工人，认识技术人员在生产中的作用。教育技术人员学会和工人相结合的群众路线的工作方法，领导他们在生产技术上做出成绩，使他们从实践中懂得依靠工人的重要。从而使他们得到改造。党的宣传干部要纠正“技术是行政的事，党只管政治”的错误看法，要在日常的生产工作中学习必要的生产知识，做到不仅政治上先进，而且在技术上也先进。为了适应工作的需要，今后应适当地在技术人员和技术工人中发展宣传员。今后，一般厂矿宣传员可发展至职工总数的百分之十，并争取每个生产小组都有一个宣传员。
    至于时事政策的宣传（例如国内外重大事件、中苏友好、工农联盟、贸易等）也必须紧密地结合生产宣传抓紧进行，使职工正确地了解时局的发展和本厂的发展方向。否则，就会产生埋头生产不问政治的倾向。此外，生产宣传上还需注意提高质量、保证安全的宣传。因为重视质量与安全，不仅是社会主义性质国营企业的基本特征之一，而且产量、质量、安全、成本等都是实际生产中一个完整而不可分割的部分。达不到质量指标，实际上也就达不到产量指标；安全出了问题也必然失掉了完成任务的保证。因此，厂矿中的宣传员必须在广大的职工中树立质量观念与安全观念，反对那种只责备职工不按操作规程，而不进行必要的保安设备的片面宣传。
    为了有力地从政治思想上推动即将到来的大规模的经济建设，会议指出：党的宣传部门的干部必须认真地学习有关经济建设的理论知识与必要的业务知识，再不容许只限于空泛的领导。不懂的东西要坚决钻进去，学会学好。要锐敏地注意新鲜事物，经常研究和总结，广泛创造和运用既深入又红火的新的宣传形式。使工矿企业中的宣传工作搞得更好。
