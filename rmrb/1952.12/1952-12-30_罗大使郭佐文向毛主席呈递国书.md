    Ambassador Luo Guozuowen Presents Credentials to Chairman Mao

    The newly appointed Ambassador of the Romanian People's Republic to China, Guo Zuowen, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong.

    Guo Zuowen, the newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Romanian People's Republic to China, along with Counselor Xilaide, Economic Counselor Anding, and First Secretary Meng Tiannu, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government at 4 p.m. on the 29th. Present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Xu Yixin, Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Department; and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department. When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Guo Zuowen delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong, to which Chairman Mao Zedong responded.

    Ambassador Guo Zuowen's Eulogy:

    Chairman, Comrade:

    I am honored to present to you the letter of credence from the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, as well as the letter of recall of the former Ambassador, Comrade Teodora Rudenco.

    On this occasion, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Presidium of the National Assembly, the Government, and the people of the Romanian People's Republic, warm greetings to you, the Central People's Government, and the great Chinese people, and wish you new achievements in the construction of an independent and new people's China.

    Chairman, Comrade, during the Second World War, the Soviet Union achieved a historic victory in the war against German fascism, and the Soviet army eliminated the main force of Japanese militarism. This helped the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by you and its heroic People's Liberation Army, to break free from the shackles of foreign imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. After the great October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution gave the entire imperialist system a new and powerful blow, intensified the national liberation struggles of the people in various colonies and dependent countries, and strengthened the forces of peace in the world.

    The great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China and the fraternal and selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to the People's Republic of China are not only conducive to the development of the People's Republic of China in the economic, political, and social fields, but also a solid guarantee for world peace.

    The working people of the People's China, who are working with infinite love for the restoration and prosperity of their motherland and for their own happiness and welfare, are proving to the world with the great achievements they have made: that liberated people, as masters of their own country, can reach the highest stage of progress under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Chairman, Comrade:

    Because the Soviet army liberated Romania, the workers of the Romanian People's Republic, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the most beloved son of the Romanian people, are enthusiastically building socialism with the multifaceted fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union. The Romanian People's Republic is building new factories, carrying out great construction projects, establishing new workers' cities, and developing a new culture rooted in the lives and achievements of the working people.

    The Romanian people—builders of a new life in their homeland—watch with great love and admiration the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all fields. These achievements are strong pillars of the cause of peace and the greatest obstacles in the path of the instigators of new wars.

    The working people of the Romanian People's Republic have formed, with great excitement, increasingly close relations of friendship and cooperation between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China in the political, economic, and cultural fields. They see that this friendship and cooperation are conducive to the consolidation of the great peace camp headed by the invincible Soviet Union and the wise teacher and leader of the world's working people, the standard-bearer of the struggle for peace—Comrade Stalin.

    Chairman, Comrade, I assure you that I will do my best with loyalty and ability to work for the development and consolidation of relations between the two countries.

    I am confident that I will receive your full support in carrying out the important mission entrusted to me.

    Please allow me to wish the great Chinese people new achievements in the construction of a new China.

    Chairman, Comrade, please allow me to wish you heartfelt success in your endeavors dedicated to the happiness of the People's Republic of China.

    Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply:

    Ambassador, Comrade:

    I am very pleased to accept the letter of credence from the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic that you have presented, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.

    In the past three years, the friendly cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic have achieved great development in the political, economic, and cultural fields. This friendly cooperative relationship has enhanced the prosperity of China and Romania and the friendship between the people of the two countries, and has strengthened the power of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Romanian people are victoriously engaged in the construction of socialism and have continuously achieved brilliant successes. These achievements have always been deeply cared for and praised by the Chinese people.

    Ambassador, Comrade, I warmly welcome you to take office as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China. In your work to consolidate the friendly cooperation between China and Romania, you will receive the full support of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    I wish you complete success in your work.

    罗马尼亚人民——祖国的新生活的建设者以极大的热爱和赞扬的心情，注视着中国人民在各方面所获得的伟大成就。这些成就是和平事业的坚强的支柱和新战争挑拨者所走道路上的最大障碍。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民以极兴奋的心情结成了罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国在政治、经济及文化等方面的日益紧密的友谊与合作关系。他们看到这种友谊与合作关系是有助于以不可战胜的苏联和世界劳动人民的英明导师和领袖，和平斗争的旗手——斯大林同志为首的伟大的和平阵营的巩固。
