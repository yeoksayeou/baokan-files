    Northeast China is actively conducting winter training for basic construction workers. A total of 150,000 workers are participating in this large-scale training, including 110,000 fixed civil engineering and construction workers from various construction companies. Winter training classes for basic construction workers in many cities and units have already started; some training classes are about to begin.
    Large-scale centralized training of basic construction workers and cadres is a new undertaking. Leading organs in Northeast China attach great importance to this work. Before the start of the winter training, the industrial departments of the CPC committees of various provinces and cities in Northeast China, the construction engineering bureaus, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues of various provinces and cities in Northeast China jointly established winter training committees. As early as August of this year, the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee learned about and studied the situation and characteristics of construction workers through meetings of grassroots cadres on construction sites and by sending cadres to conduct in-depth investigations on construction sites, in order to prepare for the winter training work. To solve the problem of teachers, many provinces and cities have held short-term teacher training classes in advance. Many trainees who have been trained have returned to their units at the end of November to lead the winter training work.
    The content of the centralized winter training for basic construction workers in Northeast China includes both political education and technical education. In the first stage, political education is conducted through lectures, discussions, seminars, introduction of typical figures and events, and film screenings. In the second stage, technical education is conducted through lectures, seminars combining technicians and workers, demonstrations and summaries of advanced producers, and practical experience in advanced technical operations of various types of work.
    While training workers, state-owned construction engineering companies in Northeast China have also held various professional training classes to cultivate a large number of technical personnel and administrative management cadres. The Construction Engineering Company of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government has established twelve training classes, preparing to train more than 4,000 outstanding technical workers and educated youth into site directors, construction workers, or administrative management personnel in finance, statistics, tools, quotas, and materials within two to four months.
    Many provinces, cities, and units have prepared good learning, living, and cultural entertainment conditions for the trainees. The workers participating in the study have a high enthusiasm for learning. For example, an old worker in Siping City said: "I am over fifty years old this year and have been working for more than thirty years. This is the first time I have had the opportunity to study. It is something I never expected. I must study hard!"
    The winter training work for basic construction workers in individual units also has shortcomings in planning and preparation. For example, the new construction site workers' housing in Qiqihar City had not been repaired by mid-December, the classroom was planned to be set up in the corridor, the teachers had not been determined, and the education plan had not been compiled. The leading cadres of some units have not yet regarded winter training as one of the current central tasks of the basic construction department. For example, the captain of the engineering team of the Fushun City Construction Bureau said to the counselors: "Workers are easy to deal with, just muddle through." The municipal system winter training committee of the city is actually not functioning, and the entire work is only the responsibility of the office, but only one section chief in the office is responsible for this work, and even meetings cannot be convened. Some units in the city also take very poor care of the students' living welfare. For example, the students in the Donggang District training class who live on two-story bunks have frost on their quilts in the morning; some places do not even have access to boiling water. Due to the lack of leadership, the students' study and life in some training classes in the city are very undisciplined. If the above shortcomings are not overcome quickly, it will seriously affect the progress of the winter training work. These shortcomings should also be given serious attention by other regions.

    东北大规模训练基本建设职工
    【本报讯】东北各地积极进行基本建设职工的冬季训练工作。参加这次大规模训练的职工共十五万人，其中十一万人是各工程公司固定的土木建筑工人。许多城市和单位的基本建设职工冬季训练班已经开学；有的训练班即将开学。
    大规模集训基本建设工人和干部，是一件新的工作。东北各地领导机关对这一工作都很重视。在冬季训练开始之前，中共东北各省、市委工业部，东北各省、市建筑工程局、工会、青年团等领导机关联合成立了冬季训练委员会。中共黑龙江省委早在今年八月，就通过工地基层干部会议和派干部深入工地调查的方式，了解并研究建筑工人的情况和特点，为冬季训练工作进行准备。为解决教员问题，好多省、市都事先举办了短期教员训练班。不少单位经过训练的学员，已于十一月末回到本单位领导冬季训练工作。
    东北区基本建设工人今冬集训的内容，包括政治教育和技术教育两方面。前一阶段，以上课，开讨论会、座谈会，介绍典型人物和事例，看电影等方式，进行政治教育。后一阶段，以上课，开技术人员和工人结合的座谈会，先进生产者表演及总结和实习各工种先进技术操作经验等方式，进行技术教育。
    在训练工人的同时，东北各地国营建设工程公司还举办了各种专业训练班，大量地培养各种技术人员和行政管理干部。东北人民政府工业部建设工程公司举办了十二个训练班，准备把四千多名优秀的技术工人和知识青年，在两个月到四个月时间内，培养成工地主任、施工员，或财务、统计、工具、定额、材料等行政管理人员。
    很多省、市和单位，都为受训职工准备了良好的学习、生活和文化娱乐条件。参加学习的职工学习情绪很高。如四平市一个老工人说：“我今年五十多岁了，做了三十多年工，今天才第一次得到学习机会，真是想不到的事。我一定要好好学习！”
    个别单位的基本建设职工冬季训练工作，也还有计划和准备不周的缺点。如齐齐哈尔市新工地工人住房，到十二月中旬还没有修好，课堂准备设在走廊里，教员没有确定，教育计划也没有编出来。有的单位的领导干部还没有把冬训工作当成基本建设部门当前中心工作之一。如抚顺市建设局工程队队长对辅导员说：“工人好办，胡弄胡弄就行。”该市市政系统冬季训练委员会实际上不起作用，整个工作只由办公室负责，而办公室却只有一个股长负责这一工作，连会议都召集不起来。该市有些单位对学员的生活福利照顾得也很差。如东岗区训练班住二层铺的学员，早晨被子上都上了霜；有的地方连开水都喝不上。由于缺乏领导，该市有些训练班学员的学习与生活非常散漫。上述缺点如不迅速克服，必将严重地影响冬季训练工作的进行。这些缺点，也应引起其他地区的严重注意。
