Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 26th: Our Eastern Front correspondent reports: The Eastern Front has entered a frigid period of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The Rhee Syngman puppet army soldiers are cowering in bunkers all day long, not daring to come out. They are even too lazy to clear the snow in the trenches, so the snow has almost filled them. Sometimes when they do come out, they have to crawl on the snow.

However, the Korean-Chinese People's Forces do not stop fighting because of the minus 30 degree cold. The soldiers are fighting the enemy by treading in knee-deep snow. In the six days from December 14th to 20th, our troops in the area of Yuhyun Mountain and Mundeung Valley east of the Bukhan River launched four small counterattacks against the enemy, winning every battle and annihilating an enemy platoon and four squads, a total of more than 100 enemy soldiers. In these battles, the soldiers demonstrated a brave and swift fighting style, and they also shouted to the puppet army soldiers on the battlefield to persuade them to surrender. Therefore, they were able to quickly resolve the battles with very little cost. On the night of the 19th, our army attacked the positions of two squads of puppet troops northwest of Byeonam-dong, killing the enemy sentries, and then immediately surrounded the bunkers, calling on the puppet troops sleeping inside to come out and surrender. The enemy, shivering, came out with their hands raised. If they encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy, the soldiers would annihilate them with fierce firepower! On the night of the 20th, our army attacked the position of an enemy platoon on the southwestern mountain of Height 1089.6, using grenades and other weapons to blow up all the enemies, and repulsed four enemy advances, annihilating more than 50 enemy soldiers.

The Korean-Chinese People's anti-aircraft artillery units on the Eastern Front are also actively engaged in air combat in the severe cold. In just two days, December 20th and 21st, they shot down and damaged 24 enemy planes.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 26th: Our front-line correspondent Zheng Dafan reported on an ambush battle on a snowy night: Ice and snow covered the Western Mountain Front. A reconnaissance team of our army went to ambush near Gachil-ri. Before departure, the scouts drank hot spicy soup to warm up their bodies, applied anti-freeze oil on their hands, faces, ears, and feet, and carefully checked their weapons and equipment. After dark, the scouts, cloaked in white camouflage cloth, walked through the half-foot-deep snow, following the direction indicated by the stars to the predetermined position. They built simple fortifications with ice and snow, set up machine guns covered with white cloth on the snow, and waited for the arrival of the enemy in the howling north wind.

Suddenly, there was the sound of leather shoes stepping on the snow. The American soldiers would walk for a while, then lie on the ground and look around. When they saw that there was no movement, they would start walking forward again. When they were only 20 meters away from our scouts, Reconnaissance Staff Officer Wang Xizhong raised his pistol and fired two "pop" "pop" shots, and the two enemies in front fell down. Our various automatic weapons immediately opened fire fiercely, and the enemies behind immediately lay on the ground and fired back. Submachine guns and machine guns sounded all at once.

The scouts ambushing on both sides saw that the enemy's firepower had been attracted, so they fiercely thrust into the enemy's rear, quickly cut the wires between the enemy's main position and the forward哨站, and fired at the enemy from behind. The American soldiers discovered that their retreat had been cut off and panicked, scurrying around in all directions. They were wearing heavy boots and ran clumsily like pigs, staggering and falling on the slippery ice and snow, howling as they fell; so they crawled and rolled on the snow, got up and ran again, and fell again....

Grenades exploded one after another in the enemy's ranks, and machine guns kept sweeping at the enemy. In less than ten minutes, the brave scouts annihilated eight squads and most of a fire platoon of the 15th Regiment of the U.S. 3rd Division. They quickly cleaned up the battlefield, carrying their captured trophies—two heavy machine guns, seven light machine guns, and twelve automatic rifles—back to their positions under the cover of artillery fire.

At the position, the cooks had prepared noodle soup and warm water for the victorious comrades-in-arms. As soon as the scouts returned to the fortifications, they took off their shoes, soaked by the deep snow, washed their feet with warm water, and then picked up bowls to drink noodle soup, excitedly talking about the battle that had just taken place.

This ambush battle received commendation from the Volunteer Army's high command.

    朝中人民部队冒大雪严寒胜利打击敌人
    我一侦察队歼敌八个班和一个排的大部
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社东部战线记者报道：东部前线已进入零下三十度的酷寒中，李承晚伪军士兵终日龟缩在地堡里不敢出来，甚至连交通沟里的积雪都懒得打扫，因而雪都快把他们的交通沟填平了，他们有时出来便只得在雪上爬行。
    但是朝中人民部队并不因为零下三十度的酷寒而停止战斗，战士们踏着深及膝盖的大雪打击敌人。自十二月十四日到二十日的六天中，北汉江以东鱼隐山、文登谷一线的我军部队，向敌人进行了四次小型反击，连战连捷，歼灭敌军一个排、四个班，共一百多名。战士们在这些战斗中发挥了勇猛、迅速的战斗作风，并在战场喊话，争取伪军士兵投降，所以用很小的代价就能很快地解决战斗。十九日夜，我军袭击边岩洞西北两个班伪军的阵地，打死了敌人的哨兵，然后立即把地堡包围起来，叫在里面睡觉的伪军出来投降，敌人就打着寒颤举着手出来了。如果遇到敌人顽抗挣扎，战士们便用猛烈火力把敌人消灭！二十日夜里，我军袭击一零八九点六高地西南山头上敌军一个排的阵地，用手雷、手榴弹等武器把敌人全部炸死，并打退前来增援的敌军四次冲锋，歼灭敌军五十多名。
    东线的朝中人民高射炮部队也在严寒中积极进行对空作战，仅二十日、二十一日两天，就击落击伤了二十四架敌机。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线通讯员郑大藩报道雪夜里的一次伏击战斗说：冰雪覆盖着西方山前线。我军的一支侦察队到加七里附近去打埋伏。出发以前，侦察兵们喝了暖身子的辣汤，手上、脸上、耳朵上、脚上都搽了防冻油，并且将武器和装备仔细地检查了一遍。天黑以后，身披白色伪装布的侦察兵们踏着半尺深的雪地，按着星斗指示的方向走到预定的位置，并用冰雪筑起简单的工事，在雪地上架起蒙着白布的机关枪，在北风呼啸中等候着敌人的到来。
    忽然传来一阵皮鞋踩在雪地上的声音。美国兵走一阵，再爬在地上向四面看看，没有什么动静又开始往前走。离我军侦察员们只有二十公尺了，侦察参谋王锡忠举起短枪“啪”“啪”两声，走在前面的两个敌人便倒下了。我军各种自动火器随着展开猛烈射击，后面的敌人立即伏在地上开枪还击。冲锋枪、机关枪顿时响成一片。
    埋伏在两侧的侦察兵们看见敌人的火力已被吸引住，便向敌人后面猛插过去，迅速剪断了敌人主阵地与前哨阵地之间的电线，并从后面向敌人射击。美国兵发现退路被切断，慌了手脚，四下乱窜起来。他们穿着笨重的靴子，像猪一样摇摇幌幌地跑着，脚踏在溜滑的冰雪上，嚎叫着跌倒了；于是就在雪地上爬着，滚着，爬起来又跑，又跌倒……。
    手榴弹一颗颗地在敌群中爆炸，机关枪不断地向敌人扫射着，不到十分钟，勇敢的侦察兵们就把美三师十五团的八个班和一个火器排大部消灭。他们迅速地打扫了战场，扛着缴获的胜利品——两挺重机枪、七挺轻机枪和十二支自动步枪，在炮火掩护下回到自己的阵地来。
    在阵地上，炊事员已给胜利归来的战友们准备了面汤和温水。侦察兵们一回到工事里，就脱下被深雪浸湿的鞋子，用温水洗了脚，然后端起碗来喝面汤，兴高采烈地谈论起刚才的战斗经过。
    这次伏击战受到了志愿军高级指挥部的表扬。
