    Harbin "Basic Construction Cultural Service Team" Active on Construction Sites

    The "Basic Construction Cultural Service Team" organized by the Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in conjunction with various artistic and cultural organizations and cultural and educational departments in the city is active on all major basic construction sites in the city. In the past six months, their work has greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for production. Workers at these construction sites previously had no cultural or recreational activities. They reported: Today, construction workers have no worries about food and clothing, and their living conditions are much better than during the puppet Manchukuo era, but they lack books to read and things to do for fun. Now, the situation is completely different. This cultural service team regularly shows them movies and slides, stages dramas, performs folk arts, provides them with books and newspapers on a mobile basis, exhibits various pictures, provides recreational equipment such as balls and chess, and organizes various seminars, story evenings, and recreational competitions. In these activities, the workers not only recovered from the day's fatigue but also received class education and patriotic education. They said with emotion: Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can construction workers receive such care and respect. The work of the construction site clubs has also been widely expanded with the help of the cultural service team. At present, most construction sites have established clubs, libraries, and mobile book boxes, and each team has more than one kind of recreational item and more than one newspaper. Some construction sites have even established their own cultural propaganda teams. The cultural service team has twelve literary and artistic cadres who regularly carry out organizational leadership work at various construction sites.

    Fushun Cultural Troupe Goes Deep into Construction Sites for Creation and Performance

    After rectification, the Fushun Cultural Troupe devoted itself to the heated basic construction work. They went deep into the lives of workers on construction sites, engaged in creation, and staged timely performances for the workers. In one month, they created more than 20 folk art works such as "Confidence in Completing Tasks," "Accelerating Progress and Ensuring Quality," "Heroes' Meeting," "Song of Construction Workers in Four Seasons," and "Storytelling of Labor Models." Their performances were warmly welcomed by the workers and improved their enthusiasm for production. Han Zhenlun, a worker from the red furnace group of a certain construction site, said after watching "Heroes' Meeting": "Seeing the cultural troupe perform our affairs, it reminded me all of a sudden. I didn't know there was a connection between the various trades in the past. In the future, I will definitely do my job well and never affect other trades." In this creation and performance, the Fushun Cultural Troupe further realized that only by going deep into reality can they transform themselves, correctly establish the idea of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and create and perform things welcomed by the masses.

    哈尔滨“基本建设文化服务队”活跃在工地上
    哈尔滨市总工会会同全市各文艺团体和文教部门组织的“基本建设文化服务队”，正活跃在全市所有较大的基本建设工地。半年以来，他们的工作已给工人的生产热情以很大鼓舞。这些工地的工人，过去没有什么文化娱乐活动，他们反应：今天建筑工人吃的穿的都不愁了，住的也比伪满时代强得多，就是缺书看，缺玩的。现在，情形完全不同了，这支文化服务队经常给他们放映电影和幻灯，排演戏剧，演唱曲艺，流动地供给他们书报，展览各种图片，供给球类、棋类等游艺用具，组织各种座谈会、故事晚会、游艺比赛等活动。工人们在这些活动里，不仅恢复了一天的疲劳，并且受到了阶级教育和爱国主义教育。他们都感动地说：只有在毛主席和共产党的领导下，建筑工人才能受到这样的关心和尊敬。工地的俱乐部工作在文化服务队的帮助下也已广泛展开。现在大部分工地建立了俱乐部、图书室和流动图书箱，每个小组有一种以上的游艺品，有一份以上的报纸。有的工地还自己成立了文艺宣传队。文化服务队有十二个文艺干部经常在各工地进行组织领导工作。
    抚顺文工团深入工地创作和演出
    抚顺文工团在整风以后，投入了热火朝天的基本建设工作。他们在工地上，深入工人生活，进行创作，并及时排演，向工人演出。他们在一个月中创作了“完成任务有信心”、“加速进度，保证质量”、“群英会”、“建筑工人四季歌”、“说唱劳动模范”等二十几个民间文艺形式的作品。他们的演出受到工人热烈的欢迎，提高了工人们的生产热情。某工地红炉组工人韩振轮看了“群英会”后说：“看到文工团演出咱们的事，一下把我提醒了。过去我不知道各个工种还有联系，今后一定把本身工作做好，决不影响别的工种。”抚顺文工团在这次创作和演出中，更进一步地体会到，唯有这样深入实际，才能改造自己，正确树立为工农兵服务的思想，创作和演出为群众欢迎的东西。
