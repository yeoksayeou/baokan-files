Xinhua News Agency, Kimhwa Front, Korea, December 6th. The Korean front has experienced its first heavy snowfall of the winter after the initial snow, and the nighttime temperature has dropped to below minus ten degrees Celsius.

    On the Shangganling battlefield, our soldiers are fighting through several inches of snow. After inflicting casualties on the enemy, they return to their dugouts equipped with heated earthen beds to rest. A sentry, fully dressed in winter gear, walked out of the position, and while taking off the cold-proof gun cover from his rifle, humorously said:

    “The American devils haven't fully put on their coats yet, but my gun has already put on its winter clothes!”

    Inside the tunnel fortifications, the soldiers have put down the straw curtains that protect the tunnel entrances from the cold and have warmed the sleeping platforms. Some are comfortably sitting on heated platforms covered with dog-skin rugs sent by the people of the motherland, studying culture; others are sitting in specially designated "warming rooms," chatting around charcoal braziers about the glorious victories of the autumn campaign and exchanging combat experiences; still others are happily entering steamy battlefield bathhouses to take a bath. Large quantities of grain, ammunition, vegetables, and charcoal are piled up in the storage rooms. The soldiers said to the logistics transport personnel: "That's enough! You don't need to risk sending things through the snow again until the spring flowers bloom!"

    In the forward supply stations, there are not only full granaries and ammunition depots, but also nearly inexhaustible firewood and enough charcoal to supply each commander and fighter with two pounds per day for heating. All of this charcoal is made by the logistics staff themselves by collecting firewood and building kilns. Motor transport units have built automobile shelters for warmth and concealment and have prepared cold-proof car covers and charcoal for thawing frozen vehicles. The baggage transport units have also provided the mules and horses with insulated caves, cold-proof cotton covers, and ample hay and feed.

    In the battlefield hospitals, the wounded and sick are lying on warm sleeping platforms covered with soft straw mats and blankets, covered with thick new cotton quilts, and have specially made cotton covers to keep the wounds warm. They have ample nutritious food such as rice, wheat flour, vegetables, canned goods, biscuits, sweets, fruits, and milk.

    From the front lines to the rear, the commanders and fighters, filled with unprecedented and abundant confidence in victory, are entering the third winter of combat on the Korean battlefield.

    朝鲜前线我军兵站弹满库粮满仓
    全体指挥员战斗员满怀胜利信心进入第三个战斗的冬天
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线六日电】朝鲜前线在初雪之后又降落了今冬的第一次大雪，夜间的气候降到摄氏零下十几度。
    在上甘岭战场上，我军战士们踏着厚有数寸的积雪进行战斗。他们在杀伤敌人以后就回到设有地炕的工事里休息。一位身着全副冬装的哨兵走出阵地，一面解下枪上的防寒枪衣，一面幽默地说：
    “鬼子兵还没全部穿上大衣，我的枪倒先穿上冬装了！”
    在坑道工事里，战士们把坑道口防寒的草帘放了下来，并且把炕烧暖了。有的舒适地坐在铺有祖国人民送来的狗皮褥子的炕上学习文化；有的坐在特设的“烤火室”里，围着炭火盆畅谈秋季作战的光辉胜利，交流作战经验；有的愉快地走进热气腾腾的战地澡塘里去洗澡。大批粮弹、蔬菜和木炭堆满了储藏室，战士们对后勤运输人员说：“够了，不到明年春花开，你们再不用冒雪送东西来啦！”
    在前线的兵站里，已经不仅是粮满仓、弹满库，而且有着几乎烧不尽的柴草和足够供给全体指挥员战斗员每人每天两斤的烤火炭。这些木炭全部都是后勤工作人员自己打柴、筑窑烧出来的。汽车运输部队都建筑了汽车保暖隐蔽部，准备了御寒车衣和烤解冻车的木炭。辎重运输部队也给骡马设立了保暖洞、防寒棉套以及充足的马草和马料。
    在战地医院里，伤病员们躺在温暖的铺着柔软的草褥和毛毯的炕上，盖着厚厚的新棉被，并且备有特制的保暖伤口的棉簚。他们有充裕的大米、白面、蔬菜、罐头、饼干、糖果、水果、牛乳等富于营养的食物。
    从前线到后方，指挥员、战斗员们满怀着空前充沛的胜利信心进入朝鲜战场的第三个战斗的冬天。
