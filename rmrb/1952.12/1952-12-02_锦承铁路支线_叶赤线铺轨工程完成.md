    Jin-Cheng Railway Branch Line
    Track-Laying Project Completed on Ye-Chi Line
    The track-laying project for the main line of the Ye (Baishou)-Chi (feng) line, a branch of the Jin (zhou)-Cheng (de) Railway, with a total length of 144 kilometers, was completed on November 16. This project started on October 3 this year, following the completion of the Jin-Cheng Railway track-laying project. All the railway construction workers summed up the experience of rebuilding the Jin-Cheng Railway and adopted the assembly-line method in the track-laying work, which greatly improved work efficiency. The average daily track-laying progress was more than four kilometers, and the highest reached six kilometers, so the rails were laid seventeen days ahead of schedule.
    After this railway is opened to traffic, it will promote the export of local products such as medicinal materials and furs, and the development of mineral deposits.
    Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, sent a telegram to the railway construction workers on the 24th to express his congratulations and encourage them to continue their efforts and complete the annual task ahead of schedule.

    锦承铁路支线
    叶赤线铺轨工程完成
    锦（州）承（德）铁路支线叶（柏寿）赤（峰）线，全长一百四十四公里的正线铺轨工程，已在十一月十六日完成。这一工程是继锦承铁路铺轨工程完成之后，从今年十月三日起开始的。全体修路职工总结了重建锦承铁路的经验，在铺轨工作中采用了流水作业方法，大大提高了工作效率。每天平均铺轨进度在四公里以上，最高达六公里，所以比原计划提前十七天把铁轨铺好。
    这条铁路通车之后，将促进当地土产如药材、皮毛的外销和矿藏的开发。
    中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远二十四日电修路职工表示祝贺，并鼓励他们继续努力，提前完成全年任务。　（新华社）
