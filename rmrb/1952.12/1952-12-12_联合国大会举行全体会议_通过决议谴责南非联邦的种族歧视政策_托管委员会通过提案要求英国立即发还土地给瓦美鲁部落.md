According to TASS: The UN General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of December 5th.

Representatives of colonial countries attempted to prevent the UN General Assembly from passing the resolution, already approved by the Special Political Committee, condemning the Union of South Africa's policy of racial discrimination. The representative of the Union of South Africa proposed that the UN General Assembly was "not qualified" to discuss the issue of racial persecution in South Africa, but this was rejected by an overwhelming majority of forty-three votes. Subsequently, the proposal submitted by eighteen Asian-Arab countries and some Latin American countries, already approved by the Special Political Committee, condemning the Union of South Africa's policy of racial persecution and stipulating the establishment of a special committee to investigate racial relations in the Union of South Africa, was put to a vote. This proposal was passed with thirty-five votes. Twenty-three delegations abstained. Delegations from the Soviet Union and other countries voted in favor. Only the South African delegation voted against it.

The UN General Assembly, with the support of a majority of forty-two votes, including the Soviet Union, passed the proposal regarding the situation of Indian residents in the Union of South Africa. This proposal stipulates the establishment of a mediation committee to arrange negotiations between the government of the Union of South Africa and the governments of India and Pakistan on this issue, and to facilitate these negotiations.

According to TASS: The Fourth (Trusteeship) Committee of the UN General Assembly heard the statements of representatives of the Wameru tribe of Tanganyika, a British "protectorate." The representative said: On November 17, 1951, more than one hundred and twenty policemen and seven officers, led by the local governor, arrived at a village of the Wameru tribe and ordered the residents to prepare to move. When the tribe refused this order, the police arrested and imprisoned six people, and burned down the homes of the local residents along with all their property. Subsequently, about three thousand households were expelled to barren and infertile land. Currently, these people are starving, they have no land, and no food.

These facts expose the violent methods and barbaric policies of British colonialists. Faced with these facts, the British representative and representatives of other colonial countries still tried in vain to justify the forced expulsion of the Wameru tribe.

The Soviet representative, J. Yulans, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, said: The British government's expulsion of local residents from their homeland and the transfer of that land to European colonists is a blatant violation of the rights of local residents and a violation of the trusteeship agreement. He urged the Fourth Committee to pass a resolution requiring the immediate return of land to the Wameru tribe.

Regardless of the resistance of the colonialists, the committee passed an eight-nation proposal, including Pakistan, Indonesia, and Syria, which stipulated that Britain should immediately take measures to return the land to the Wameru tribe and should compensate the tribe for the losses it suffered during the forced expulsion.

Delegations from thirty-two countries, including the Soviet Union, voted in favor of the proposal, while delegations from seventeen countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted against it. Three delegations abstained.

This resolution passed by the Fourth Committee is another failure for the colonial countries in the United Nations.

    联合国大会举行全体会议
    通过决议谴责南非联邦的种族歧视政策
    托管委员会通过提案要求英国立即发还土地给瓦美鲁部落
    据塔斯社讯：联合国大会十二月五日下午举行全体会议。
    殖民国家的代表们企图阻止联合国大会通过特别政治委员会已经通过的关于谴责南非联邦实行种族歧视政策的决议。南非联邦的代表提议说，联合国大会“没有资格”讨论南非种族迫害的问题，然而它遭到四十三票压倒多数的反对。接着就把特别政治委员会已经通过的十八个亚洲阿拉伯国家和某些拉丁美洲国家所提出的关于谴责南非联邦种族迫害政策并规定建立一个特别委员会以调查南非联邦种族关系的提案提付表决。这个提案以三十五票获得通过。二十三个代表团弃权。苏联等国代表团都投票赞成。投反对票的只有南非代表团。
    联合国大会在苏联等四十二票多数的赞成之下通过了关于南非联邦印度籍居民状况的提案。这个提案规定建立一个调解委员会，以便安排南非联邦政府和印度与巴基斯坦两国政府就这个问题举行谈判，并且促成这个谈判。
    据塔斯社讯：联合国大会第四（托管）委员会听取了英国“保护国”坦噶尼喀的瓦美鲁部落的代表的陈述。这个代表说：一九五一年十一月十七日，以地方长官为首的一百二十多个警察和七个军官来到瓦美鲁部落的一个村庄里，命令居民准备搬家。当这个部落拒绝这个命令时，警察就把六个人逮捕下狱，把当地居民的住屋连同他们的一切财物放火烧光。随后并把约有三千户人家驱逐到干旱的不毛之地去。目前这些人都在挨饿，他们没有土地，也没有粮食。
    这些事实，揭露出英国殖民主义者的强暴手段和野蛮政策。英国代表以及其他殖民国家的代表面对这些事实，还徒劳无功地企图替武力驱逐瓦美鲁部落一事作辩解。
    苏联代表，拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部副部长尤兰斯说：英国政府把当地居民逐出他们的乡土，把那片土地移交给欧洲殖民者，这就明目张胆地侵犯了当地居民的权利，违背了托管协定。他敦促第四委员会通过一项决议要求立刻把土地发还给瓦美鲁部落。
    委员会不顾殖民主义者的抗拒，通过了包括巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚和叙利亚在内的八国提案，其中规定英国应立即采取措施把土地发还给瓦美鲁部落，并应赔偿这个部落在被强制放逐期间所受的损失。
    包括苏联等国在内的三十二个国家的代表团投票赞成这个提案，美、英、法等十七国的代表团投了反对票。三个代表团弃权。
    第四委员会通过的这个决议，是殖民国家在联合国中的又一次失败。
