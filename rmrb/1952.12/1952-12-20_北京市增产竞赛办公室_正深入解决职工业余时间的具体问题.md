To the Editor: In response to the reader's letter review "Further Study and Reasonably Solve Several Problems in Workers' Spare Time Activities" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on November 30th, which pointed out that "after uniformly stipulating the system of workers' spare time activities, how to further study and solve the specific working methods and work coordination problems of the party, government, labor union, and youth league at the factory level, as well as the issue of streamlining unnecessary organizational structures, should be the focus of in-depth leadership and research at present." We are currently leading and organizing relevant factories to conduct specific research. In the future, relevant issues, experiences, and opinions in this regard will continue to be published in the newspaper in order to completely solve this problem.

    正深入解决职工业余时间的具体问题
    编辑同志：十一月三十日人民日报《读者来信》栏发表的关于“进一步研究合理解决职工业余活动中的几个问题”的读者来信述评中，指出“在统一规定了职工业余活动时间的制度以后，如何进一步研究解决厂级党、政、工、团的具体工作方法和工作配合问题及精简不必要的组织机构问题，应该是当前深入领导和研究的重点。”对此，我们正在领导和组织各有关工厂进行具体研究。今后有关这方面的问题、经验和意见，我们当继续在报上发表，以期彻底解决这个问题。
