The Tianjin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee has consistently valued the work of the People's Supervision Correspondents, ensuring its smooth progress and significant achievements. Tianjin currently has 878 People's Supervision Correspondents. According to incomplete statistics, out of the 331 cases handled by the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee in 1951, 99 were reported by Supervision Correspondents, accounting for approximately 30% of the total. From June to October 1952, the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee handled 376 cases, 137 of which were reported by Supervision Correspondents, accounting for 36% of the total (excluding cases from the "Three-Anti" campaign).

Because Supervision Correspondents are distributed across various departments and work in different positions, they can promptly discover and report problems. Through their active involvement, Tianjin has not only exposed illegal and derelict behavior of some government staff, cracked down on certain bureaucrats, educated cadres, and improved work, but also recovered considerable losses for the country and the people, further strengthening the relationship between the government and the people. For example, the Supervision Correspondent at the Municipal Second Hospital reported that nurse Feng Guoxi embezzled streptomycin, endangering patients. Zhu Ming, the Supervision Correspondent at the Liaoning Provincial Industry Department's Purchasing and Marketing Office in Tianjin, reported that the Xingye Oil Felt Factory under the office made errors in material allocation, causing over 20,000 rolls of oil felt to be spoiled, resulting in a loss of 199.8 million yuan to the state. Cao Dong, the Supervision Correspondent at the Foreign Trade Administration, reported that over 20,000 tons of peanuts stored at the North China Regional Oils Company were infested with insects, resulting in a loss of over 180 tons in weight alone, worth nearly 1 billion yuan. Liang Mancun, the Supervision Correspondent at the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, reported that the company used over 4,000 tons of coal to fill pits and pave roads. The Wang Yinsheng Supervision Correspondent Group at the State-owned Tianjin Second Cotton Mill reported that the Textile Administration Bureau violated labor policies by privately hiring temporary workers, resulting in frequent work-related injuries. After inspection, it was found that the bureau's factories had 162 work-related accidents from January to April 1952 alone, and had privately hired 1,533 temporary workers in the past year. These cases have all been appropriately handled by the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee, or are being carefully processed.

Some Supervision Correspondents have not only played a supervisory role in their own departments, but can also fight against unhealthy tendencies in other agencies. For example, the Supervision Correspondent at the Municipal First Hospital, while treating injured people in a fire, inquired about the case and reported it to the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee. Ma Demao, a Supervision Correspondent at the Tax Bureau, discovered in the account books of private merchants that a customs cadre had accepted a bribe of 50,000 yuan and reported it to the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee. After the Supervisory Committee contacted the customs, a corruption case involving more than 8 million yuan was uncovered. In addition to actively reporting issues related to government cadres, some Supervision Correspondents can also closely connect with the broad masses, conduct propaganda and education on People's Supervision work to the masses, and report the people's voices to the Municipal Supervisory Committee. For example, the Supervision Correspondents at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, taking advantage of their work, not only frequently reported clues about illegal and derelict behavior of some cadres, but also reported many public opinions and social problems to the Municipal Supervisory Committee. They are not only the eyes and ears of the supervisory organs, but also good propagandists of supervisory work. Through them, the influence of supervision work among the masses has been expanded, the relationship between the government and the people has been strengthened, and the initiative in the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee's work has been enhanced. Especially during the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," production competition, and judicial reform movements, facts have proven that most of the Supervision Correspondents are the backbone of launching movements in various units. Their leading and promoting role has enabled the movements to be carried out more smoothly.

The reason why the work of the People's Supervision Correspondents in Tianjin has achieved these results is mainly that the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee has consistently valued this work, maintained constant contact with them, and provided timely guidance to their work; and paid attention to the selection, training, and improvement of the Supervision Correspondents. At the beginning of establishing the Supervision Correspondents, the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee frequently held meetings to report to them on the nature and authority of the supervision work, as well as the current guidelines and tasks, and arranged for them to carry out their work. Small-scale forums were also held for Supervision Correspondents from different business departments, focusing on the center of gravity of the work, and educating them with practical materials related to the business of their departments. For example, with the work of production safety and security as the center, the Municipal Supervisory Committee reported to the Supervision Correspondents of various units under the Industry Bureau about the systemic inspection materials of a factory regarding work-related accidents, and organized everyone to discuss them in conjunction with their own factory's situation, and everyone felt that it was helpful to their work. For the Supervision Correspondents of various units under the Municipal Health Bureau, the Municipal Supervisory Committee focused on medical accidents and introduced them to the overall situation of the inspection of the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, so that everyone could consider the actual situation of their own units and report many problems.

The Municipal Supervisory Committee has handled the problems reported by the Supervision Correspondents in a relatively responsible and timely manner. No matter how big or small the problem is, they have paid attention to ensuring that everything has a result and everything is accounted for, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm for work. If some problems could not be solved temporarily, timely replies were also made, explaining the reasons. Their opinions were also solicited when handling problems. This approach is also a reason why the work of the People's Supervision Correspondents in the city has been able to develop.

The Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee pays great attention to the quality and organizational purity of the Supervision Correspondents. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, there were 649 Supervision Correspondents in the city, most of whom were developed during previous movements such as rectification and cadre review. They generally underwent considerable tests and had a certain quality and working ability. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the Municipal Supervisory Committee expanded the organization on a new basis and newly developed 275 Supervision Correspondents. And through this great movement, a comprehensive examination was made of the past Supervision Correspondents, and an organizational rectification was carried out. Among them, 65 people who themselves had problems of corruption, unclear history, and loss of position, although the circumstances were not very serious, were also dismissed from their posts as Supervision Correspondents. For some Supervision Correspondents who had been inactive for a long time, such as Zhang Youbo, the Supervision Correspondent of the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, who had not made a single report on the more than 150 accidents that had occurred in the hospital in the past year; and Liu Shitong, the Correspondent of the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who witnessed the illegal and undisciplined behavior of the police officer Feng Jingquan infringing on human rights, abusing his powers, and arbitrarily handcuffing people, but did not report it, were also dismissed.

In addition, the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee also compiled and printed a "Correspondent's Small Newspaper" to introduce work methods and exchange work experience, which also played a considerable role in the development of the work.

In the way of establishing Supervision Correspondents, the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee used to adopt the method of "asking the leaders of each unit to nominate and recommend, and reporting to the Municipal Supervisory Committee for review and approval." Although this method also ensured the considerable quality and level of the Supervision Correspondents, it was limited to a certain extent in expanding the propaganda and education of People's Supervision work, especially in the contact between the Supervision Correspondents and the masses and in winning the support of the masses, because it did not pass through democratic discussions and mass elections. In addition, the development of Supervision Correspondents in Tianjin is still unbalanced, and many units are still blank spots or have very few people. For example, there are only 32 Supervision Correspondents in the entire Tanggu District, and only eight in Tianjin County, and the street correspondents in the city have not yet begun to be established, which is quite a distance from the development and needs of the objective situation. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the Tianjin Municipal Supervisory Committee is preparing to adopt extensive democratic discussion and mass election methods to universally set up Supervision Correspondents and implement the instructions of the State Council and the Central Supervisory Committee.

### 天津市人民监察通讯员工作有成绩

    天津市人民监察通讯员工作有成绩
    天津市人民监察委员会一贯重视人民监察通讯员工作，使这一工作进行得很好，并取得相当成绩。天津市现有人民监察通讯员八百七十八人。据不完全的统计，一九五一年天津市监委所受理的三百三十一件案件中，有九十九件是监察通讯员反映的，约占总数百分之三十。一九五二年六月至十月，天津市监委受理案件三百七十六件，有一百三十七件是监察通讯员反映的，占总数百分之三十六（不包括“三反”运动中的案件）。
    由于监察通讯员分布在各个不同的部门，在各个不同的岗位上工作，因而他们能够及时发现和反映问题。天津市依靠他们的积极活动，不仅揭发了某些机关工作人员的违法失职行为，打击了某些官僚主义分子，教育了干部，改进了工作，而且为国家和人民挽回了不少损失，使政府与人民群众的关系更加密切了。例如：市立第二医院监察通讯员曾反映护士冯国玺贪污连霉素，危害病人。辽东省工业厅驻津购销处监察通讯员朱明，反映该处所属兴业油毡厂在配材料上发生错误，致使两万多卷油毡全部变质，国家遭到一亿九千八百余万元的损失。对外贸易管理局监察通讯员曹东，反映华北区油脂公司所存两万多吨花生米发生虫蚀，仅在重量上即损失一百八十余吨，价值近十亿元。煤业建筑器材公司监察通讯员梁满存，反映该公司用燃煤四千多吨填坑垫道。国营天津第二棉纺织厂王寅生监察通讯小组，反映纺织管理局违反劳动政策，私雇临时工，经常发生工伤事故。后经检查，发现该局各厂一九五二年一至四月即发生工伤事故一百六十二起，一年来私雇临时工达一千五百三十三人。这些案件，都已经天津市监委适当处理，或正在慎重处理中。
    有些监察通讯员不仅对本部门的工作起了监督作用，而且能与其他机关的不良倾向做斗争。例如市立第一医院的监察通讯员在医治某失火案中的受伤人员时，即去了解了该案的情况，向天津市监委作了报告。税务局监察通讯员马德茂在检查私商的账簿中，发现海关某干部受贿五万元，便报告了天津市监委。后经监委与海关联系，查出了一件贪污八百多万元的贪污案件。还有一些监察通讯员除积极反映有关机关干部的问题外，并能密切联系广大人民，向群众进行人民监察工作的宣传教育，向市监委反映人民的呼声。例如市公安局的监察通讯员利用工作上的便利，不但经常反映一些有关干部违法失职的线索，还向市监委反映了很多群众意见和社会上发生的问题。他们不但是监察机关的耳目，也是监察工作很好的宣传者。通过他们，扩大了监察工作在群众中的影响，密切了政府与人民群众的联系，加强了天津市监委工作中的主动性。特别是在“三反”、“五反”、生产竞赛和司法改革等运动中，事实已经证明：大部分监察通讯员是各单位发动运动的骨干。他们的带头作用和推动作用，使运动得以更顺利地开展。
    天津市人民监察通讯员工作所以取得这些成绩，主要原因是天津市监委一贯重视这一工作，经常和他们保持联系，及时指导他们的工作；并注意了监察通讯员的选择、培养和提高。天津市监委在建立监察通讯员之初，便经常召开会议，向他们报告有关监察工作的性质、职权及当前的方针任务，布置他们进行工作；并按照不同的业务部门召集监察通讯员小型座谈会，抓住工作重心，以有关本部门业务的实际材料对他们进行教育。例如：市监委曾经以生产保安工作为中心，向工业局所属各单位的监察通讯员报告了某厂关于工伤事故的系统检查材料，并组织大家结合本厂情况进行讨论，大家都感到对自己工作有帮助。对于市卫生局所属各单位的监察通讯员，市监委曾抓住医疗事故，向他们介绍检查市传染病院的全面情况，使大家能结合考虑本单位的实际情形，反映出不少问题。
    市监委对于监察通讯员所反映的问题，都作了比较认真负责和及时的处理。不论问题大小，都注意了事事有结果，件件有交代，鼓励了大家的工作热情。有的问题一时不能解决，也作了及时的答复，说明了原因。在处理问题时，还征求了他们的意见。这种做法，也是该市人民监察通讯员工作得以开展的原因。
    天津市监委对于监察通讯员的质量和组织上的纯洁很注意。该市在“三反”运动前共有监察通讯员六百四十九人，大部是在整风、审干等历次运动中发展的。一般都经过了相当的考验，有一定的质量和工作能力。“三反”运动后，市监委又在新的基础上扩大组织，新发展监察通讯员二百七十五人。并且经过这次伟大的运动，对过去的监察通讯员做了全面的考查，进行了组织上的整顿。其中本身有贪污腐化、历史不清、丧失立场等问题的六十五人，虽情节都不太严重，也都解除了他们的监察通讯员职务。对于一些长期不起作用的监察通讯员，如市传染病院的监察通讯员张幼博，对该院一年来所发生的一百五十余次事故没有做过一次报告；公安七分局通讯员刘世通对于该局警士冯景泉侵犯人权、滥用职权、随便给人戴手铐的违法乱纪行为，身历现场，竟不反映，也都一并解职。
    此外，天津市监委还编印了“通讯员小报”，介绍工作方法，交流工作经验，这对于工作的开展也起了相当作用。
    在建立监察通讯员的方式上，天津市监委过去多是采取“请各该单位领导提名推荐，报由市监委审核批准”的方式。这种方式虽然也保证了监察通讯员的相当质量和水平，但由于没有通过民主讨论和群众的选举，因此在扩大人民监察工作的宣传教育上，特别是在监察通讯员和群众的联系以及争取群众的支持上，受到一定的限制。此外，天津市监察通讯员的发展也还不平衡，许多单位还是空白点或人数很少。如塘沽全区才有三十二名监察通讯员，天津县一县只有八名，全市的街道通讯员迄今尚未着手建立，这都与客观情况的发展和需要有着相当的距离。为了克服这些缺点，天津市监委准备采取广泛的民主讨论和群众选举的方式，普遍设置监察通讯员，贯彻政务院和中央监察委员会的指示。
