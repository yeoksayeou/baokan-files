    Henan Runan Oil and Fat Branch Company Leaders Disregard Workers' Suggestions, Causing Injury Accident

    Editor: This year, Runan County, Henan Province, had a bumper sesame harvest, and farmers are eager to sell sesame. However, the leading cadres of the Runan Oil and Fat Branch Company did not make preparations for the purchase in advance. Only when a large amount of sesame was on the market did they temporarily buy some old wood to make support poles for the sesame stacks. At that time, the porters put forward their opinions, saying that the old wood was not strong and easily broken, so it could not be used. The leading cadres of the oil and fat company ignored them and said, "We are for increasing production and practicing economy, so it doesn't matter if we use old wood." On the morning of November 8, these support poles made of old wood broke, and the sesame bags on the stack fell down, injuring five people and damaging a weighing scale. I believe that the Runan Oil and Fat Branch Company's one-sided emphasis on economy and ignoring the workers' rationalization proposals is wrong and should be deeply criticized.

### 河南汝南油脂支公司领导干部忽视工人建议造成伤人事故

    河南汝南油脂支公司领导干部忽视工人建议造成伤人事故
    编辑同志：今年河南省汝南县芝麻丰收，农民迫切要求出售芝麻。但汝南油脂支公司领导干部事先并没有做好收购准备工作，等到芝麻大量上市，才临时到街上买了些旧木料，做芝麻囤垛的垫杆。当时搬运工人纷纷提出意见，说旧木质量不坚，容易折断，不能用。油脂公司的领导干部竟不理睬，还说：“咱们是为了增产节约，用旧木没关系。”在十一月八日上午，这些用旧木做的垫杆折断了，垛上的芝麻包倒了下来，砸伤了五个人，压坏了一台磅秤。我认为汝南油脂支公司这种片面强调节约，忽视工人的合理化建议是不对的，应作深刻检讨。
