How to Summarize Newspaper Work Experience
Dong Qian

Systematically summarizing newspaper work experience to improve the professional and ideological level of newspaper workers, thereby improving newspaper work and making it more adapted to the requirements of objective reality, has become an urgent problem to be solved.

In the new situation, our Party, our country, and the people have greatly increased their demands on newspapers. Newspapers should undoubtedly become skilled propagandists of the Party and the state's economic and cultural policies and enthusiastic mobilizers of the broad masses to participate in large-scale economic and cultural construction.

The Main Situation of Our Newspaper Work

However, an examination of the main situation of our newspaper work reveals that it is not commensurate with the above requirements. Newspaper workers should first be familiar with newspaper business, but many newspaper workers are not fully competent in this regard. Some people have been doing newspaper work for several years and still do not understand how to do their job well. Some have been engaged in interviewing and writing for a long time and still don't know how to write lively reports. Newspapers often feature "generalized" and "stereotyped" news and communications. Some comrades who are quite responsible on the news front do not fully understand what is the ideological nature and mass character of newspapers, and what is the organizational role of newspapers.

Newspaper workers should be familiar with various practical tasks, but many editors and reporters lack knowledge of various aspects of practical work, especially production knowledge. For example, "Changchun Daily" simply regarded the Kovalev method as "rational organization of manpower" due to a lack of understanding of the content of advanced experience, and uniformly promoted "high-speed cutting," "high-speed cutting," and "ultra-high-speed cutting" as "high-speed cutting." Some newspaper staff, due to a lack of agricultural science knowledge, blindly advocated applying more manure, resulting in incomplete germination of seedlings. There are many such examples. Readers in the Northeast criticized this situation: "Professionals laugh at it, and outsiders don't understand it."

However, some comrades doing newspaper work are still satisfied with this situation, believing that even if the level of work does not improve, "they still write and edit稿 every day"; some also feel the importance of learning and studying business, and some even stipulate study time, but they often fail to do so because they are "busy with work and rushing tasks." They displayed considerable empiricism and bureaucratism in their work. As "Jilin Daily" and the five newspaper editorial departments in Shenyang confessed, they were busy all day long, editing稿 based solely on their own half-baked knowledge, rarely formally studying policies and business, and even less studying the laws of development of various practical tasks. Therefore, they showed great blindness in their daily newspaper work. "Jilin Daily" did not check and summarize its work for a year, nor did it seriously study a news report, nor did it seriously learn from the advanced experience of other newspapers. They sometimes learned from other newspapers' experiences in running small columns and carrying out ideological discussions, but after a few "lively" days in the newspaper, there was no "follow-up" or it "failed."

This newspaper work situation, which is very incompatible with objective requirements, must be gradually changed, and regularly and systematically summarizing newspaper work experience is one of the effective ways to change this situation.

The Role of Summarizing Newspaper Work

Summarizing work has a promoting effect on improving the professional level of cadres. It can pool the wisdom of the masses, concentrate work experience from various aspects, analyze and study it, eliminate the dross and select the essence, summarize and generalize it, find out the successful experiences and lessons of failure, and find out the basic methods for improving work, so as to continuously educate and improve the professional level of cadres. Summarizing reporting work can enable newspaper workers to recognize the importance of going deep into reality and closely connecting with the masses. Because serious work summaries will inevitably prove that the main key to the success or failure of newspaper work lies in understanding reality and connecting with the masses. Regularly summarizing work can enable us to gradually understand and grasp the laws of reporting work, gradually improve our working methods, change from passive to active, and change from blind busyness to working with foresight and planning. The process of summarizing work is also the process of improving working methods and work style.

Basic Methods for Summarizing Newspaper Work

In order to do a good job in summarizing, we must pay attention to the methods of summarizing. If the method is incorrect, the purpose of summarizing work cannot be achieved.

First, we must oppose the formalistic method of summarizing. In the past, many newspaper editorial departments loved to make "comprehensive" large summaries, the content of which was all-encompassing, unconnected, without a center, mentioning all problems, but not solving any problems. Some were summarized with one problem as the center, which was originally a better method. However, because of the lack of a clear point of view, the lack of concrete analysis, not proceeding from the actual situation, not grasping the specific characteristics, and the lack of concrete improvement methods, it also became a "generalized" formalistic method of summarizing. These "stereotyped" and "generalized" summarizing methods do not play much of a role in improving newspaper work. We should grasp the main problems according to the main situation of the work, make specific analysis of a specific report (such as the report on promoting advanced experience or the report on the mutual aid and cooperation movement, etc.), or a certain reporting form (such as news, communications, etc.), so as to draw clear conclusions and formulate methods for improving work.

Second, summarizing newspaper work must adopt a method that combines top-down and internal-external. That is to say, within the newspaper, leading cadres should solicit the opinions of staff in various departments in various ways, so that everyone participates in the summarizing work, and at the same time, it should be combined with going deep into the masses of readers to investigate and research, and the results of the investigation and research should be used as one of the important bases for the editorial department to summarize its work. The method of "summarizing work behind closed doors" is wrong and easily becomes stereotyped, which is not very helpful for improving work. After "Shanxi Daily", "Heilongjiang Daily", and many newspaper editorial departments in the Northeast recently adopted the method of combining internal and external factors, they broke the "stereotyped" summarizing method, concentrated new materials and opinions, and played a great role in promoting the improvement of newspaper work. For example, when many provincial and municipal newspaper editorial departments in the Northeast sent people to factories to investigate, they found that workers were willing to read the Northeast "Labor Daily" but not their newspapers, and found that the reports on industrial production were "laughable to experts and incomprehensible to outsiders." After this, they studied and analyzed its causes and solutions from all aspects. This greatly enhanced the practical significance of summarizing work.

Going deep into the masses for investigation and research is best done by combining typical investigation and general investigation. For example, if a provincial newspaper wants to investigate the opinions of the masses on industrial production reports, it should focus on the cadres and workers of factories, but it should also listen to the opinions of rural cadres and farmers. If it is a workers' newspaper, it should not only focus on factories as the key area of investigation, but also on the masses of workers. Typical investigations should not be arbitrarily selected, and the key points must be determined according to the nature and object of the newspaper and the task of the investigation. Therefore, the task of the investigation must be clear. What problems should be solved, what goals should be achieved, etc., should be considered carefully in advance.

In order to better concentrate the correct opinions of the masses, the editorial department of the newspaper, especially the leading comrades, must make the greatest efforts. If the editorial department only conducts investigation and research, but does not conduct a systematic summary on the basis of the investigation and research, and does not formulate a plan for improving the newspaper, then this investigation and research will inevitably become a waste of manpower. Therefore, while emphasizing investigation and research, we must never relax the summary from within the editorial department.

There are many ways to summarize work from within the editorial department. By unit, there are individual, group, and full editorial department work summaries; by issue, there are industrial production, agricultural production...reporting summaries. Among industrial production reports, there are also basic construction, promotion of advanced experience...reporting summaries; by the newspaper's own business, there are summaries of interviewing, writing, editing, mass work..., and in writing methods, there are summaries of how to write news, communications, short comments... These classifications are all based on actual work and the division of labor in the newspaper. Therefore, when summarizing work, we should focus on one problem, especially the most important problem in the current work, instead of using a "one-size-fits-all" summary method. However, the central issues are not isolated and unconnected.

Summarizing work is an art of leadership. We must not only learn how to summarize various tasks, but also learn how to grasp the "heat," that is, choose the appropriate time, and be timely. We must make it regular and systematic. Only in this way can we easily grasp the "heat" in the work, and can we continuously improve the professional level of cadres. Therefore, summarizing work should become a system.

The methods and time for summarizing cannot have a unified and rigid provision. Newspaper editorial departments in various places should formulate specific and feasible methods according to their actual situation, and ensure the regularization of summarizing work from the system, overcoming the shortcomings of not summarizing for a long time or having a "big summary" once a year.

    怎样总结报纸工作经验
    董谦
    系统地总结报纸工作经验，以提高报纸工作者的业务水平、思想水平，从而改进报纸工作，使其更加适应客观实际的要求，这已成为急应解决的一个重要问题。
    在新的形势下，我们的党，我们的国家和人民，对报纸的要求大大提高了。报纸无疑地应该成为党和国家的经济文化政策的熟练的宣传者和组织广大群众参加大规模经济文化建设工作的热情的鼓动者。
    我们报纸工作的主要情况
    但是，考察我们报纸工作的主要情况，却跟上述的要求并不相称。报纸工作者首先应该熟悉报纸的业务，可是，不少报纸工作者对此并不完全在行。有些人做了几年报纸工作，还不了解怎样来做好自己的工作。有些人干了长时期的采访写作工作，还不大会写生动活泼的报道。报纸上常常出现“一般化”、“老一套”的新闻和通讯。有些在新闻战线上相当负责的同志，也不完全了解什么是报纸的思想性、群众性，什么是报纸的组织作用。
    报纸工作者应该熟悉各项实际工作，但不少编辑和记者都缺乏关于各方面实际工作的知识，尤其缺乏生产知识。例如“长春新报”，由于不了解先进经验的内容，竟把郭瓦廖夫工作法单纯地当作“合理组织人力”，把“快速切削”、“高速切削”、“超速切削”一律当作“高速切削”来宣传。有些报纸工作人员由于缺乏农业科学知识，就盲目提倡多上粪，结果使禾苗出不齐全。这样的例子，是很多的。东北的读者对这种状况提出了批评：“内行看了发笑，外行看了不懂”。
    然而有些做报纸工作的同志仍然满足于这种情况，认为即使工作水平不提高，“还不是天天照样写稿编稿”；有的虽也感觉到学习、研究业务的重要性，有的甚至还规定了学习时间，但是他们却常因“忙工作，赶任务”而不能说到做到。他们在工作中表现了相当严重的经验主义和事务主义。正如“吉林日报”和沈阳五个报纸编辑部所检讨的，他们整天忙忙碌碌，仅凭自己一知半解的知识来就稿编稿，很少正规地研究政策和业务，更少研究各项实际工作的发展规律，因此在日常报纸工作中表现了极大的盲目性。“吉林日报”一年没有检查总结过工作，也没有认真研究过一篇新闻报道，也不认真学习其他报纸的先进经验。他们有时也学一下别的报纸办小专栏、开展思想讨论等经验，但在报上“热闹”几天，就没有“后劲”或“流产”了。  
    这种跟客观要求很不相称的报纸工作状况，必须逐步加以改变，而经常地、系统地总结报纸工作经验，便是改变这种状况的有效方法之一。
    总结报纸工作的作用
    总结工作对于提高干部业务水平有推进作用。它可以集思广益，把各方面工作经验集中起来，加以分析研究，去粗取精，概括总结，找出成功的经验和失败的教训，找出改进工作的基本方法，以此来不断教育和提高干部的业务水平。总结报道工作能够使报纸工作者认识深入实际、密切联系群众的重要性。因为认真的工作总结必然会证明：报纸工作成败的主要关键就在于对实际的了解和对群众的联系。经常总结工作能使我们逐步认识和掌握报道工作的规律，逐步改进我们的工作方法，由被动转向主动，由盲目忙乱转为有预见、有计划地进行工作。总结工作的过程，也就是改进工作方法和工作作风的过程。
    总结报纸工作的基本方法
    为了做好总结工作，必须讲究总结工作的方法。如果方法不对，也不能达到总结工作的目的。
    第一，必须反对形式主义的总结方法。过去许多报纸编辑部爱作“全面的”大总结，内容包罗万象，互不联系，漫无中心，什么问题都提到，但什么问题也没有解决。有的是以一个问题为中心进行总结的，这原是比较好的方法。但因为缺乏明确的观点，缺乏具体的分析，不从实际情况出发，不抓住具体的特点，没有具体的改进办法，结果也成为“一般化”的形式主义的总结方法。这些“老一套”、“一般化”的总结方法，对改进报纸工作是不起多少作用的。应该根据工作的主要情况，抓住主要问题，对某一具体的报道（如推广先进经验的报道或互助合作运动的报道等），或对某一种报道形式（如新闻、通讯等），作具体的分析，从而得出明确的结论，定出改进工作的办法。
    第二，总结报纸工作必须采取上下结合和内外结合的方法。这就是说，在报社内部，领导干部应该以各种方式，征集各部门工作人员的意见，使大家都参加总结工作，同时还要和深入读者群众调查研究结合起来，并以调查研究的结果作为编辑部总结工作的重要根据之一。“关门总结工作”的方法，是不对的，容易成为老一套，对改进工作帮助不大。“山西日报”、“黑龙江日报”以及东北许多报纸编辑部在最近采用内外相结合的方法后，打破了“老一套”的总结方法，集中了新的材料和意见，对改进报纸工作起了很大的推动作用。譬如，东北很多省市报纸编辑部派人到工厂调查时，发现工人愿看东北“劳动日报”，不愿看他们的报，发现工业生产的报道是“内行看了发笑，外行看了不懂”等问题后，便从各方面研究分析它的原因和解决的办法。这就大大增强了总结工作的现实意义。
    深入群众调查研究，最好采取典型调查和一般调查相结合的方法。例如，省级报纸要调查群众对工业生产报道的意见，应该以工厂的干部、工人作为调查的重点，但同时也应该听取一下农村干部和农民的意见。如果是工人报，那就不仅应该以工厂为调查重点，而且应以工人群众为重点。典型调查是不应随意选定重点的，必须根据报纸的性质、对象和调查的任务来定。因此，调查的任务，一定要明确。究竟要解决什么问题，达到什么目的等等，事前都应考虑成熟。
    为了很好集中群众的正确意见，报纸的编辑部尤其是领导同志必须尽最大的努力。如果编辑部仅仅作了调查研究，而没有在调查研究的基础上进行系统的总结，也没有订出改进报纸的方案，那么这种调查研究也就必然变成人力浪费。因此，在强调调查研究的同时，绝不能放松从编辑部内部进行总结。
    从编辑部内部总结工作的方法是多种多样的。以单位来分，有个人的、小组的、全编辑部的工作总结；以问题来分，有工业生产、农业生产……的报道总结。工业生产报道中，又有基本建设、推广先进经验……的报道总结；以报纸本身的业务来分，有采访、写作、编辑、群众工作……的总结，写作方法中又有怎样写新闻、通讯、短评……的总结。这些分类都是依据实际工作和报纸的分工来决定的。因而，在总结工作时，就应该以一个问题为中心，特别是要以当前工作中最主要的问题为中心，而不应采用“一揽子”的总结方法。但中心问题，也不是孤立的、互无联系的。
    总结工作是一门领导的艺术，我们不但要学会总结各项工作的方法，而且要学会抓“火候”，就是选择适当时机，要及时。要作到经常化、系统化。只有如此，才易于抓取工作中的“火候”，也才能不断地提高干部的业务水平。因此，总结工作应成为一种制度。
    总结的方法和时间，不可能有一个统一的死板的规定。各地报纸编辑部应根据自己的实际情况，订出具体可行的办法，并从制度上保证总结工作经常化，克服长期不总结或一年一次“大总结”的缺点。
