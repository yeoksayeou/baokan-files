    In the sparsely populated Greater Khingan Range, the soldiers of the Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are working intensely to build a forest railway.

    The Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army arrived in the Greater Khingan Range in May of this year. This heroic unit has rendered meritorious service to the people in the war to liberate the motherland. Within this unit, many comrades wear medals of honor, having crossed half of China, traveled through twelve provinces, and arrived in the Greater Khingan Range. They are to build a people's railway on this majestic mountain range.

    The Greater Khingan Range is a beautiful and magnificent mountain range. Its highest peak is 1,700 meters high, and the lowest is over 1,000 meters. The entire mountain range is covered with dense, verdant forests, forming a sea of forests 800 li long and 400 li wide. This is an ancient forest area, with many trees over a hundred years old. The straight trunks are dozens of feet high, some reaching tens of feet. The thickest trunks require two or three people to encircle. On the edge of this forest area grow dazzling white birch trees; in the central part stand evergreen yellow pine trees; and along the mountain streams grow fountain-like weeping willows. These yellow pines and white birches can be used as building timber, as well as raw materials for rubber, alcohol, and papermaking. This is a rich treasure of the motherland. However, due to the destruction by Japanese imperialism and the difficulty of transportation, countless timbers in the Greater Khingan Range have rotted or been burned. In order to develop this rich treasure, the Central People's Government decided to extend the forest railway from the terminal of the Yakeshi forest railway further into the mountains – the Kutu (Tuli River) section – so that trains can directly reach the forest area of the Greater Khingan Range.

    The Greater Khingan Range area has year-round snow cover and permanent ice layers. When flowers are in full bloom in southern China, people in the Greater Khingan Range still have to wear cotton clothes. The coldest weather has reached fifty-two degrees below zero. Building a railway in such a place is very difficult. One shovel into the hard ice layer only leaves shallow marks. When the soldiers arrived here, they had no houses to live in, no sufficient tools, and no adequate material supplies. During the day, the soldiers worked all day, and at night they slept on the snow. When thirsty, they drank the yellow water from the mountains. Most of the soldiers came from the south, and some had never seen ice and snow since birth. Therefore, they were unaccustomed to the life here when they first arrived, and many soldiers became ill and suffered from frostbite.

    However, our soldiers were not daunted by the difficulties. They knew that overcoming temporary difficulties and building the motherland meant building lasting happiness; the blood and sweat shed now would soon cultivate the flowers of victory. Therefore, they worked happily, overcoming difficulties and advancing. Soldiers sometimes broke through a foot-thick ice layer, wearing cotton clothes and standing in the cold water to work. After they finished their work, their clothes froze into "ice tubes," making a "swishing" sound when they walked. But the soldiers continued to work in such clothes, so the ice on their clothes was quickly melted by hot sweat; the cold wind slowly dried the clothes. Comrade Wang Zhengtai, a Communist Party member of a certain company, had his foot cut by a shovel, and the wound was as big as a mouth, but he didn't care. He wrapped the wound with cloth and led everyone to work again. Under his leadership, the soldiers of the entire company completed the task originally scheduled to be completed in forty days in twelve and a half days. Comrade Han Chenglin, a platoon leader of a certain company, was seriously injured in the war of liberation of the motherland, but since the start of construction, in addition to leading the work of the entire platoon, he personally dug and carried earth. Under his impetus, the work efficiency of the entire platoon was improved, and each person in the entire platoon averaged 4.66 cubic meters of earth dug per day.

    When they started construction, due to lack of experience and tools, the work efficiency could not be improved. The Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in response to this situation, put forward the call to "use your brains, create more, and improve the efficiency of road construction," and the soldiers immediately responded to this call. Soldier Zhang Zhongbao, in the absence of tools, used a bayonet to create a wooden-wheeled cart for transporting earth, replacing the original carrying poles and earth baskets, which doubled the work efficiency. This news quickly spread to the construction site, and then new creations and inventions continued to emerge. The soldiers of two platoons of a certain company used bayonets to make more than eighty wooden-wheeled carts and more than two hundred earth baskets. Platoon leader Gai Yunchao created a small wooden donkey suitable for transporting earth in forest areas, increasing work efficiency by three times.

    It is very difficult to manufacture tools in the Greater Khingan Range. There are no saws, no chisels, and even less files and drills. But none of these can stump the people's soldiers. They used bayonets to cut wood, used stones as drills, and made hundreds of tools.

    Due to the soldiers' high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, work efficiency generally increased three to ten times, enabling the rapid completion of the railway construction task. In early October of this year, the soldiers victoriously completed the first phase of the forest railway construction task, building a 39-kilometer-long railway, which was 15 kilometers more than originally planned. Now this 39-kilometer railway has been opened to traffic. Trains run on it day and night, carrying timber to supply the needs of basic construction in various parts of the country. The construction of this railway has also brought economic prosperity to this remote forest area. A new city is being built in the Tuli River area. The Tuli River sawmill has expanded several times. Jiligulu and Qiaolikong, places that originally only had names but no people, will soon become bustling towns. (Attached picture)

    The roadbed of the Kutu section of the forest railway is eighteen meters high. This is the scene of the soldiers cheering after building this section of the roadbed.

    铁路修到了大兴安岭
    ——记中国人民解放军铁道工程部队修筑库图段森林铁路
    梁青
    在人烟稀少的大兴安岭，中国人民解放军铁道工程部队的战士们正在紧张地修筑森林铁路。
    中国人民解放军铁道工程部队，是在今年五月间开上大兴安岭的。这支英雄部队，曾经在解放祖国的战争中，为人民立下了功劳。在这支部队里面，有不少的同志胸前挂着荣誉的奖章，他们曾经穿过半个中国，走过十二个省份，开到了大兴安岭。他们要在这雄伟的山岭上，修筑一条人民铁道。
    大兴安岭是一个美丽而雄伟的山岭。他的最高峰有一千七百公尺高，最低的也在一千公尺以上。整个山岭披盖着密密的、青绿色的森林，组成了一个八百里长、四百里宽的森林的海洋。这是一个古老的大森林区，很多树木有一百多年的历史。笔直的树杆高达数丈，有的高达数十丈。最粗的树杆两三人都合抱不住。在这个森林区的边缘长满了耀眼的白桦木；在中央部分都竖立着长年发青的黄花松；在山涧的沿岸都长满着喷泉似的垂杨。这些黄花松木和白桦木，可以作建筑的木料，也可以作胶皮、酒精和造纸的原料。这是祖国丰富的宝藏。但是由于日本帝国主义的破坏和运输的困难，大兴安岭的木材不知腐烂了多少，不知被烧掉了多少。为了开发这富饶的宝藏，中央人民政府决定从牙克石森林铁路的终点，再往山中修一条铁路——库（图尔）图
    （力河）段，使火车能够直达大兴安岭的森林区。
    大兴安岭一带，长年积雪，有着永久不化的冰层。当祖国南方鲜花盛开的时候，在大兴安岭的人还要穿棉衣。最冷的天曾达零下五十二度。在这样的地方，修筑铁路，是很困难的。在坚硬的冰层上，一铁锹挖下去，只在冰层上留下一些浅痕。战士们来到这里，没有房子住，没有足够的工具，又没有充分的物质的供应。白天战士们工作一天，夜间便睡在雪地上，渴了就喝山中的黄色的水。战士们大多数来自南方，有的生下来就没有见过冰雪，因此刚到这里，生活不习惯，很多战士们害了病，生了冻疮。
    但是，我们的战士们并没有被困难吓倒。他们知道，克服暂时的困难，建设祖国，就是建设永久的幸福；现在所流的血汗，不久就会培养出胜利的花朵。因此，他们愉快地工作着，克服困难前进。战士们有时打开一尺厚的冰层，穿着棉衣站在冰冷的水里工作，当他们做完工作以后，衣服冻成了“冰筒”，走起路来“唰唰”地响；但战士们穿着这样的衣服，还继续工作，因此衣服上的冰又很快地被热汗溶化了；寒风慢慢地吹干了衣服。某连共产党员王正泰同志的脚被铁锹划破了，伤口有嘴那样大，但是他毫不介意，用布包好伤口，又领导大家干了起来。在他的带动下，全连战士以十二天半的时间完成了原定四十天完成的任务。某连排长韩成林同志，曾在祖国解放战争中负过重伤，但他自开工以来，除了领导全排工作外，还亲自挖土、挑土。在他的推动下，全排的工作效率提高，全排每人每天平均挖四点六六立方公尺土。
    他们在开始施工时，由于没有经验，缺乏工具，工作效率总是提不高。中国人民解放军铁道工程部队党委针对这个情况，提出“开动脑筋，多创造，提高修路的效率”的号召，战士们马上响应了这个号召。战士张忠宝在没有工具的情况下，用一把刺刀造出了一辆运土的木轮车，代替原来的扁担和土筐，使工作效率提高了两倍。这一消息飞快地传到工地，接着新的创造和发明就不断涌现出来。某连两个排的战士，用刺刀制成了八十多辆木轮车和二百余付土筐。排长盖云超，创造出适合森林地区运土的小木驴，提高工作效率三倍。
    在大兴安岭上制造工具，是很不容易的。没有锯子，没有凿子，更没有锉和钻。但是这些都难不住人民战士。他们用刺刀砍木头，用石头当钻刀，造出了数百件工具。
    由于战士们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，工作效率普遍提高了三倍至十倍，使得修筑铁路的任务迅速完成。今年十月初，战士们胜利地完成了修筑森林铁路第一段工程的任务，修好了三十九公里长的铁道，比原计划多修了十五公里。现在这三十九公里铁路已经通车了。火车在上面日夜奔驰，载运着木材，供应祖国各地基本建设的需要。这条铁路的修建，也给这荒僻的森林区带来了经济的繁荣。图力河区在建设着一座新的城市。都鲁库尔的锯木厂扩大了数倍。吉力古鲁、桥力空这些原来只有地名而没有人烟的地方，不久将成为热闹的城镇。（附图片）
    库图段森林铁路的路基，有十八公尺高。这是战士们修好这段路基后欢呼的情景。
