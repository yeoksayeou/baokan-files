Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: A spokesperson for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee issued a statement regarding the persecution of peace activists by the governments of the United States, Japan, and Thailand. The text is as follows: After the conclusion of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the U.S. State Department issued an order on November 16th, notifying all U.S. ports of entry and embassies in various countries, ordering them to arrest the U.S. representatives who attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and to revoke their passports. Similarly, under the direction of the U.S. occupation forces, the Japanese Yoshida government issued arrest warrants for the Japanese representatives who attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and subjected Professor Minami Hiroshi, a Japanese representative who returned to Tokyo on November 18th, to intrusive searches and harassment. While the U.S. and Japanese governments were persecuting peace activists, the Thai Phibun government also launched atrocities against Thai peace activists, successively arresting the chairman and members of the Thai Peace Committee and people from all walks of life who support peace, including Nai Charoon Suksaeng, Khun Lhak Sakulpradit, Madam Ningnuan Chunhaphon, Nai Marut Bunnag, Nai Ari Liwirat, and over a hundred others since October 9th, and passed a reactionary decree to suppress the peace movement. Such incidents of persecuting peace activists have also occurred in some other countries.

We, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, strongly protest the unreasonable actions of the U.S., Japanese, and Thai governments in persecuting peace activists, violating people's rights, and suppressing the peace movement.

Prior to the convening of this conference, the governments of the United States, Japan, and Thailand violated the good wishes of their own people; in particular, the U.S. and Japanese governments refused to issue passports, threatened and obstructed the representatives attending the conference, attempting to undermine the convening of the conference; after this meeting, they arrested and persecuted the representatives attending the conference and their own country's peace supporters, which demonstrates to the people of the world the hostile attitude of the governments of the United States, Japan, and Thailand towards the great cause of opposing war and defending peace. The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions and the world demand peace and take it as their responsibility to defend peace, but the response of the U.S., Japanese, and Thai governments is that peace is a crime, which cannot but arouse the anger and opposition of all peace-loving people.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会发言人发表声明
    抗议美国日本和泰国政府迫害和平人士
    【新华社三十日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会发言人就美国、日本、泰国三国政府迫害和平人士事发表声明。文如下：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议闭幕以后，美国国务院于十一月十六日发布一项命令，并通知美国所有入境口岸及驻各国使馆，命令他们逮捕出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表，并吊销他们的护照。同样的，日本吉田政府在美国占领军的指使之下，对出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表，也发出了逮捕令，并对十一月十八日返抵东京的日本代表南博教授横加搜查和刁难。在美国和日本政府迫害和平人士的同时，泰国銮披汶政府也发动了迫害泰国和平人士的暴行，从十月九日起接连逮捕了泰国和平委员会主席、委员及各界拥护和平人士乃乍仑·速盛、古腊·柿巴立、宁暖·春拉蓬夫人、乃玛律·纹纳、乃亚里·李威腊等一百余人，并通过一项镇压和平运动的反动法令。此类迫害和平人士的情事，在若干其他国家也还发生着。
    我们，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会对于美国、日本和泰国政府迫害和平人士、侵犯人民权利及镇压和平运动的无理行为提出严重的抗议。
    美国、日本和泰国政府在这个会议召开以前即违背着他们本国人民善良的愿望，特别是美国和日本政府拒绝签发护照，对出席会议的代表进行威胁和阻挠，企图破坏会议的召开；在这个会议以后，又对出席会议的代表和本国拥护和平人士加以逮捕迫害，这就在全世界人民面前表现美国、日本和泰国的政府对反对战争保卫和平的伟大事业的敌对态度。亚洲及太平洋区域各国以及全世界人民都要求和平，以保卫和平为自己的责任，美国、日本、泰国政府的回答却是和平有罪，这不能不引起一切爱好和平的人民的愤怒和反对。
