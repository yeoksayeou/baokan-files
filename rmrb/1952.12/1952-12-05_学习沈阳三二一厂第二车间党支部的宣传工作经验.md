    Learn from the Propaganda Work Experience of the Second Workshop Party Branch of Shenyang No. 321 Factory
    The propaganda work experience of the Second Workshop Party Branch of Shenyang No. 321 Factory, published in this newspaper today, is worth learning from by Party branches in industrial and mining enterprises across the country.
    The Second Workshop of Shenyang No. 321 Factory is an advanced workshop in Northeast China. The workshop overfulfilled its production increase and economy plan last year. Since the launch of the production increase and economy campaign this year, its production index has risen rapidly. In June, they completed 112.85 percent of the state production plan and 145 percent of the production increase and economy plan; in July, they completed 113.28 percent of the state production plan and 156.5 percent of the production increase and economy plan. The most important reason why the Second Workshop of Shenyang No. 321 Factory can become an advanced workshop and achieve such excellent production results is the strong propaganda and education work of the Party in this workshop. Under the Party's in-depth propaganda and education, the ideological consciousness and production enthusiasm of the workers have been continuously improved, and advanced experiences have been conscientiously promoted, thus ensuring the frequent overfulfillment of production plans and the continuous rise of production indices.
    The main characteristic of the propaganda work of the Second Workshop Party Branch of Shenyang No. 321 Factory is that it can be production-oriented, grasp the ideological problems of the masses, and carry out systematic ideological education work. In promoting advanced production experiences, the workshop Party branch does not carry out propaganda abstractly, detached from the ideological problems existing among the masses, but closely grasps the key problems in production, grasps the ideological problems of the masses, and conducts propaganda targeting these problems. They pay close attention to understanding the ideological details of the masses, studying specific methods for removing various ideological obstacles, enlightening the masses' awareness in a planned and step-by-step manner, and specifically helping them solve various difficulties in promoting advanced experiences, thereby enhancing the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and promoting them to consciously learn advanced production experiences, master advanced production technologies, and strive to continuously improve production.
    How does the propaganda work of the workshop Party branch grasp the ideological problems of the masses and conduct ideological education? Their main method is to discover and establish advanced models as examples for everyone to learn from, and to enlighten everyone and drive everyone with the advanced thoughts and deeds of advanced figures. They first study and summarize the advanced thoughts of advanced figures who have made outstanding achievements or new creations in production, and widely and deeply publicize the advanced thoughts of advanced figures to the masses. Using the methods of "typical demonstration" and "ideological comparison," they enlighten the masses to recognize the errors of backward thoughts, automatically discard the baggage of backward thoughts, and emulate advanced thoughts, forming a mass self-education movement. Experience has proved that this mass line propaganda and education method is the most practical and effective method for removing ideological obstacles and universally improving the ideological consciousness of the masses. But unfortunately, many propaganda and education workers in factories do not yet know how to use such methods. They are accustomed to using simple and rigid methods of "struggle," and even using methods of sarcasm and attack to treat the backward thoughts of the masses. In fact, this method is extremely harmful. The result of doing so is not only unable to promote the consciousness of the masses, but often hinders the improvement of their enthusiasm. This method is absolutely the opposite of the method of the No. 321 Factory Party Branch. In the future, all Party propaganda workers in industrial and mining enterprises should change this harmful method and earnestly learn the propaganda method of the Second Workshop Party Branch of Shenyang No. 321 Factory.
    Why can the propaganda work of the workshop Party branch achieve such results and create this successful experience? It is mainly because the Party branch has strong unified leadership over the workshop's propaganda work and earnestly implements the policy of combining political work with economic work. They recognize that the continuous improvement of the ideological consciousness of the workers and the full exertion of their enthusiasm and creativity are the main driving forces for promoting production development, so they attach great importance to ideological leadership, attach importance to propaganda work, and regard in-depth and effective propaganda and education work as a reliable guarantee for production work. Whenever production tasks are assigned, the Party branch immediately leads the forces of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and uses all propaganda tools to carry out large-scale propaganda work targeting the ideological problems of the masses and the key problems of production, so that propaganda work truly becomes the pioneer of production work. At the same time, they also know that propaganda work can only have vivid content and play a powerful role if it is truly based on in-depth ideological work. Therefore, they always put ideological work in an important position in the entire propaganda work.
    It should be pointed out that there are not a few Party branches in factories and mines across the country whose propaganda and education work is as good as that of the Second Workshop Party Branch of Shenyang No. 321 Factory. For example, the propaganda and education work of the Coking Department Party Branch of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the Wire Rod Department Branch of Tianjin Iron and Steel Plant is very good, thus enabling production work to achieve significant results. But on the other hand, the propaganda and education work of many factory and mine Party branches is still not done well and far behind production work. They do not understand how to grasp the thoughts of the masses and grasp the key points of production, but only carry out general, empty, and simple propaganda in the same way, so they cannot have a real promotion effect on production work. All such factory and mine branches should carefully study and learn from the propaganda work experience of the Second Workshop Party Branch of Shenyang No. 321 Factory and use it to improve their own work.

### 学习沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作经验

    学习沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作经验
    本报今天发表的沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作经验，值得各地工矿企业的党支部学习。
    沈阳三二一厂第二车间是东北的一个先进车间。该车间去年超额完成了增产节约计划，今年开展增产节约运动以来，生产指数更迅速上升。六月份他们完成了国家生产计划百分之一一二点八五，完成增产节约计划百分之一四五；七月份完成国家生产计划百分之一一三点二八，完成增产节约计划百分之一五六点五。沈阳三二一厂第二车间之所以能成为一个先进的车间，它的生产所以能获得这样优异的成绩，最重要的原因，就是在这个车间中有了党的强有力的宣传教育工作。在党的深入的宣传教育下，工人的思想觉悟和生产积极性不断提高，认真推广了先进经验，因而保证了生产计划的经常超额完成和生产指数的不断上升。
    沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部宣传工作的主要特点，就是能面向生产，抓住群众的思想问题，进行有系统的思想教育工作。该车间党支部在推广先进生产经验中，不是离开群众中存在的思想问题空泛地进行宣传，而是紧紧地抓住生产上的关键问题，抓住群众的思想问题，针对这些问题去进行宣传。他们十分注意摸清群众的思想底细，研究扫除各种思想障碍的具体方法，有计划有步骤地启发群众的自觉，并具体帮助他们解决推广先进经验中的各种困难，从而提高职工群众的劳动积极性和创造性，推动他们自觉地学习先进生产经验，掌握先进生产技术，为不断提高生产而努力。
    该车间党支部的宣传工作是怎样抓住群众的思想问题，进行思想教育的呢？他们的主要方法就是发现和树立先进典型，作为大家学习的榜样，用先进人物的先进思想和事迹去启发大家，带动大家。他们首先研究和总结出在生产上有突出成绩或有新创造的先进人物的先进思想，将先进人物的先进思想向群众进行广泛深入的宣传，用“典型示范”“思想对照”的办法，启发群众认识落后思想的错误，自动地丢掉落后思想的包袱，向先进思想看齐，形成了群众性的自我教育运动。经验证明，这种群众路线的宣传教育方法，是扫除思想障碍，普遍提高群众思想觉悟的最实际有效的办法。但可惜的是现在有许多工厂的宣传教育工作人员尚不懂得运用这样的方法，他们习惯于用简单生硬的“斗争”的方法，甚至用讽刺打击的办法去对待群众的落后思想。事实上，这种办法是极有害的，这样做的结果，不但不能促进群众的自觉，反而常常会妨碍他们的积极性的提高。这种方法和三二一厂党支部的方法是绝然相反的两种方法。今后一切工矿企业的党的宣传工作人员，应该改变这种有害的方法，认真学习三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传方法。
    该车间党支部宣传工作为什么能获得这样的成绩并创造出这个成功的经验呢？主要是由于党支部对车间宣传工作有着坚强的统一领导，并且认真执行了政治工作和经济工作相结合的方针的缘故。他们认识到职工群众思想觉悟的不断提高和积极性、创造性的充分发挥，是推动生产发展的主要动力，所以他们非常重视思想领导，重视宣传工作，把深入有效的宣传教育工作看作是生产工作的可靠保证。每当生产任务布置下来时，党支部即领导党、工会、青年团的力量，利用一切宣传工具，针对群众的思想问题和生产关键问题，开展声势浩大的宣传工作，使宣传工作真正成为生产工作的开路先锋。同时，他们也知道宣传工作只有真正建立在深入的思想工作的基础上，才能有生动的内容，并发挥强大的作用。所以他们总是把思想工作放在整个宣传工作的重要地位上。
    应当指出，全国各厂矿党支部的宣传教育工作，像三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作做得一样好的，是不在少数的。例如太原钢厂炼焦部党支部和天津钢厂线材部支部的宣传教育工作就做得很好，因而使生产工作获得了重大成绩。但是另一方面也有很多厂矿党支部的宣传教育工作仍然做得很不好，远落在生产工作的后面。他们不懂得抓群众思想，抓生产关键，而只是千篇一律地进行一般化的、内容空泛的、方式简单的宣传，因而不能对生产工作发生真正的推动作用。凡是这样的厂矿支部，就应当好好研究和学习沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的这个宣传工作经验，利用它来改进自己的工作。
