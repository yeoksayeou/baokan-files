Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: After returning to their country from attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, Indonesian representatives spoke to the press about their impressions.

    Elder of the Islamic Scholars, Abbas, solemnly declared to the press that after seeing the "Exhibition of Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by the United States Government" in Beijing, we cannot help but believe that bacteriological warfare was indeed carried out.

    Oto Rendunuu, speaking about the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, particularly pointed out: This conference was held in an atmosphere of full democracy and respect for national sovereignty. When talking about his impressions of the new China, he said: His impression of the new Chinese society is: orderly, peaceful, and beautiful. The actual situation in the new China now is several times better than what he had heard and imagined in the past.

    Professor Abidin praised the achievements of the new China in all aspects. He said: People are shocked by the great achievements of China in harnessing the Huai River and building railways, etc., but I am even more shocked by the transformation of customs and habits. Due to the improvement of people's lives and the increase of political awareness, the new China has reached the point where no one picks up lost articles.

    Mrs. Rasuna Said said: Everything in the new China is well-organized and full of vigor. I cannot find appropriate words to describe the many moving and exciting things I saw in the new China. The new China is not only clean in its environment but, more importantly, clean in the hearts of the people.
