    Since the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee introduced and promoted the advanced experience of the 321 Factory in political work at the industrial propaganda work symposium held in late August, most provincial and municipal party committees in the Northeast region have conducted serious study and dissemination. The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee first conveyed and discussed it at the municipal committee meeting, and then convened a propaganda work conference attended by party committee secretaries and propaganda ministers of factories, mines, and construction sites, focusing on the understanding of the party committee's ideological and political leadership and examining the leadership of the party committee in propaganda work. After the meeting, the Anshan Municipal Committee made a "Decision on Strengthening the Leadership of Propaganda and Education Work." The Anshan Municipal Committee is also preparing to convene a political work conference to further discuss and resolve the issue of leadership in political work. The party committees of Hegang, Fushun, Benxi, and Changchun City, in addition to conveying the political work experience of the 321 Factory at the municipal committee meetings, also convened city-wide cadre meetings of workshop level and above for dissemination and discussion.

    After the dissemination of the political work experience of the 321 Factory, the leadership of various factories and mines had the following reactions:

    I. Some factories and mines have realized that the political work experience of the 321 Factory is a successful experience, a "complete set of experience," which is worth learning. Therefore, these factories and mines actively and conscientiously study and promote this experience. Xiaofengman Power Plant and the Northeast Railway Party Committee have selected propaganda cadres to study on the spot at the 321 Factory. The Fushun Open-pit Mine Party Committee convened a conference of all propaganda cadres of the mine, as well as cadres above the section and stock level in party, mass organizations, and administrative departments, and conducted a special dissemination. Afterwards, each branch also conducted discussions in conjunction with actual work. The propaganda cadres also conducted a systematic review of their work. The Fushun Open-pit Mine Party Committee also conducted key experiments in order to better promote this experience. The party committee members, party members, and members of the Communist Youth League in various factories and mines in Benxi have studied this advanced political work experience, and the production of these factories and mines has been improved. For example, the steelmaking workshop of the Benxi Machinery Factory often failed to complete its production tasks in the past. After learning and adopting the political work experience of the 321 Factory and raising the awareness of the masses, it completed its production tasks ahead of schedule. This made them deeply realize that learning from the political work experience of the 321 Factory is a good way to ensure the completion of production tasks.

    II. Some factories and mines have not yet realized that the political work experience of the 321 Factory is an advanced work experience and a good way to ensure the completion of production tasks, and therefore regard the promotion of this political work experience as an "extra burden." They regard political work and economic work as opposing things, rather than as unified things. When the municipal party committee arranged to study the political experience of the 321 Factory, a party committee member of a factory in Benxi said to the secretary of the Youth League General Branch of the factory: "You can only engage in production, don't do anything else." Among the thirty state-owned factories in Harbin, only eighteen factories briefly studied the relevant documents, and the other factories did nothing; even a propaganda cadre of one factory said: "If propaganda work is done like that of the 321 Factory, other work will not need to be done, just engage in propaganda work!"

    III. Some factories and mines believe that their own situation is different from that of the 321 Factory, so it is difficult to learn and promote the political work experience of the 321 Factory. They said: "These experiences are good, but the work processes of the 321 Factory are simple, while the production process of our factory is very complex," "The 321 Factory has many cadres, but our factory lacks strength." Cadres of the Changchun Light Industry Bureau Engineering Company also believed in the discussion that the experience of the 321 Factory is good, but it may not be feasible to promote it in the basic construction department. Some individual factories and mines also believe that their own political work has been done well and there is no need to learn from the experience of the 321 Factory. This blind complacency hinders these cadres from continuing to improve and improve their work.

    According to the situation of promoting the political work experience of the 321 Factory in various places before October, the main problem in the leadership of the party's political work in industrial and mining enterprises is that most of the party's and mass organizations' work cadres, especially the vast number of newly promoted party and mass organizations' cadres at the workshop level, do not yet know how to correctly carry out political work. In addition to the fact that they still have some vague or incorrect understandings in their thinking, the basic reason is that they lack work experience and do not know how to do political work. Therefore, after the introduction and promotion of the more complete and more specific experience of the 321 Factory, it has generally caused a good response. According to a report from western Liaoning, the grassroots party organizations of factories and mines—the branches—are very enthusiastic about learning from the political work experience of the 321 Factory. The booklet "Propaganda Work of the Party Branch of the Second Workshop of the 321 Factory" published by the Northeast People's Publishing House had an initial print run of 30,000 copies, which sold out as soon as it was published. It can be seen that the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres for learning working methods is very high. The Northeast Bureau pointed out in its instructions on completing the annual basic construction and industrial production plan in the fourth quarter: "Face the grassroots, go deep into the grassroots, cultivate typical examples, and specifically help the grassroots summarize the experience in the grassroots work, so as to improve the grassroots work. In addition to specifically summarizing the existing grassroots work experience, each province (city) committee and each management bureau needs to specifically help summarize one or two advanced leadership methods of advanced factories and mines in the fourth quarter, such as: how to be a factory director, a workshop director; how to be a party committee secretary, a workshop branch secretary; how to be a trade union chairman and a Youth League secretary, etc., and spread these vivid and specific experiences to other factories and mines by means of reports, lectures, etc." Various places in the Northeast are combining the implementation of the Northeast Bureau's instructions on completing the annual basic construction and industrial production plan in the fourth quarter with the pilot work of promoting the political work experience of the 321 Factory. At present, many places have cadres in charge of the propaganda department of the party committee personally conducting pilot work.

    In the process of promoting the political work experience of the 321 Factory this time, the general factory and mine party committees not only initially checked some problems in their own ideological and political leadership, but also checked the past understanding and practices of propaganda work, as well as the shortcomings of propaganda work in industrial and mining enterprises, thus laying a good foundation for improving propaganda work in industrial and mining enterprises. For example, the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee specifically made a "Decision on Strengthening the Leadership of Propaganda and Education Work." This decision pointed out that the party in Anshan City had some vague understandings of the party's ideological and political leadership in the past. Some party leaders thought that the party's work was organizational work, and propaganda work was not the party's work. They regarded propaganda work as just cheering up, a gust of wind, and engaging in some lively forms; some leaders thought, "The task cannot be completed, so how can we take care of propaganda work?" Some leaders have the idea of "emphasizing organization and neglecting propaganda," thinking that propaganda work is more abstract, and it doesn't matter whether more or less is done, so the party committee rarely discusses and checks it. Propaganda cadres are generally equipped with fewer and weaker personnel. For example, some party committees are equipped with nine organizational cadres but only one propaganda cadre; some are equipped with thirteen organizational cadres and only five propaganda cadres. Moreover, the transfer of propaganda cadres is frequent. One general branch transferred five propaganda cadres in half a year. According to these situations, the Anshan Municipal Committee decided that the party committees of various factories and mines should be equipped with sufficient propaganda cadres. The Harbin Municipal Committee plans to equip grassroots propaganda cadres in the fourth quarter and improve various propaganda work systems. The Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee is also preparing to improve the working ability of propaganda cadres through propaganda work experience exchange meetings. These practices of actively starting from improving propaganda work to strengthen the party's ideological and political leadership are all good and can be referred to and learned from by various places.

### 东北各厂矿学习三二一工厂政治工作的先进经验

    东北各厂矿学习三二一工厂政治工作的先进经验
    自从中共中央东北局宣传部在八月下旬召开的工业宣传工作座谈会上，介绍与推广三二一工厂政治工作先进经验以后，东北区大部分省、市委都进行了认真的研究与传达。中共鞍山市委首先在市委会上传达与讨论，然后召开由厂矿及建筑工地的党委书记和宣传部长参加的宣传工作会议，着重讨论党委对思想政治领导的认识，检查党委对宣传工作的领导问题。会后鞍山市委作出了“关于加强对宣传教育工作领导的决定”。鞍山市委还准备召开一次政治工作会议，进一步讨论和解决关于政治工作的领导问题。鹤岗、抚顺、本溪、长春市委，除在市委会上传达三二一厂政治工作经验外，又都召开了全市车间以上的干部大会进行传达与讨论。
    传达三二一工厂的政治工作经验以后，各厂矿领导方面有以下几种反映：
    一、有些厂矿已经认识到三二一工厂的政治工作经验是成功的经验，是“一整套的经验”，值得学习的。因此这些厂矿就积极地认真地学习和推广这
    一经验。小丰满发电厂、东北铁路党委都选派宣传干部到三二一工厂实地学习。抚顺露天矿党委召开了全矿宣传干部及党的、群众团体的、以及行政方面科、股长以上的干部大会，进行了专门的传达。过后各支部也都结合实际工作进行了讨论。宣传干部并对自己的工作进行了一次系统的检查。抚顺露天矿党委还进行了重点试验，以便更好地推广这一经验。本溪各厂矿的党委委员、党员及团员都学习了这一先进的政治工作经验，这些厂矿的生产也就有了改进。例如本溪机械厂的炼钢车间，过去常不能完成生产任务，在学习和采用三二一工厂的政治工作经验，提高群众觉悟之后，就提前完成了生产任务。这使他们深刻地体会到学习三二一工厂的政治工作经验，是保证完成生产任务的好方法。
    二、有些厂矿还没有认识到三二一工厂的政治工作经验是先进的工作经验，是保证完成生产任务的好方法，因而把推广这一政治工作经验，当作一种
    “额外负担”。他们把政治工作和经济工作看作对立的东西，而不把它们看作统一的东西。本溪有一个工厂的党委委员在市委布置学习三二一工厂政治经验时，对本厂的青年团总支书记说：“你只能搞生产，别的啥也不要干。”哈尔滨市三十个国营工厂中，只有十八个工厂简单地学习了一下有关文件，其他工厂就没有动静；甚至有一个工厂的宣传干部还说：“宣传工作要做得都像三二一厂那样，别的工作就不用干了，光搞宣传工作吧！”
    三、有些厂矿认为本身情况和三二一工厂情况不同，因而很难学习与推广三二一厂的政治工作经验。他们说：“这些经验是好的，不过三二一厂的工序简单，而我们厂的生产过程就很复杂”，“三二一厂的干部多，可是我们厂的力量不足”。长春轻工局工程公司干部在讨论中，也认为三二一厂的经验是好的，可是拿到基本建设部门推广恐怕不行。也有个别厂矿认为本厂的政治工作已经做得不错，不必再学习三二一厂的经验。这种盲目的自满情绪妨碍了这些干部继续改进和提高工作。
    根据十月份前各地推广三二一工厂政治工作经验的情况看来，目前在工矿企业中党的政治工作领导上存在的问题，主要是大部分党的和群众团体的工作干部，特别是广大的新提拔的车间一级党的和群众团体的干部，还不懂得如何正确地去进行政治工作。这除了他们在思想上还存在一些模糊的或是不正确的认识外，基本原因在于他们缺少工作经验，不会作政治工作，所以在介绍和推广三二一工厂的比较完整和比较具体的经验以后，就普遍引起好的反映。根据辽西的报告，厂矿的基层党的组织——支部对学习三二一厂政治工作经验的劲头很大。东北人民出版社出版的“三二一工厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作”的小册子初版三万册，刚出版就销售一空。可见基层干部学习工作方法的热情很高。东北局在关于第四季度内完成全年基本建设与工业生产计划的指示中指出：“面向基层，深入基层，培养典型，具体帮助基层总结基层工作中的经验，从而提高基层工作，各省（市）委与各管理局除具体总结已有的基层工作经验外，并需在第四季度内具体帮助总结一两个先进厂矿领导方法上的先进经验，例如：怎样做一个厂长、一个车间主任；怎样做党委书记、车间支部书记；怎样做工会主席与青年团书记等，并将这些生动具体的经验以报告、讲座等方法传播给其他厂矿”。东北各地正把执行东北局关于第四季度内完成全年基本建设与工业生产计划的指示与推广三二一工厂政治工作经验的试点工作结合起来。目前，不少地方已由党委宣传部负责干部亲自动手进行试点工作。
    在这次推广三二一工厂政治工作经验的过程中，一般的厂矿党委不但初步检查了自己思想政治领导上的某些问题，而且检查了过去对宣传工作的认识和做法，以及工矿企业中宣传工作的缺点，这样就给改进工矿企业的宣传工作打下了很好的基础。例如中共鞍山市委专门做出了“关于加强对宣传教育工作领导的决定”。这一决定里指出：鞍山市的党过去对于党的思想政治领导的认识有模糊之处。有些党的领导干部以为党的工作就是组织工作，宣传工作不是党的工作，把宣传工作看作只是打打气，一阵风，搞些热闹的形式而已；有些领导干部以为
    “任务都完不成，那能顾到宣传工作哪？”有些领导干部存在着“重组织、轻宣传”的思想，以为宣传工作较抽象，多做少做没关系，因此党委会也就很少讨论和检查。宣传干部一般配备得少而弱。例如：有的党委会配备了九个组织干部、但只配备一个宣传干部；有的配备了十三个组织干部而只配备五个宣传干部。而且宣传干部的调动频繁。有一个总支在半年内就调动过五个宣传干部。根据这些情况，鞍山市委决定各厂矿党委应配备足够的宣传干部。哈尔滨市委计划在第四季度配齐基层宣传干部，健全各种宣传工作制度。沈阳市委宣传部也准备经常通过宣传工作经验交流会来提高宣传干部的工作能力。这些积极地从健全宣传工作着手以加强党的思想政治领导的做法，都是很好的，各地都可以参考学习。
