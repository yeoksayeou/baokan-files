    Anshan Iron and Steel's Two Major Projects Achieve Good Results in Winter Construction
    New Construction of Xi'an Power Plant Proceeds Tensely with Winter Construction
    [This Newspaper Reports] The winter construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Projects 0190 and 0230 has achieved good results.
    Since November, cold waves have repeatedly struck Anshan, with the temperature dropping to a low of minus 15.5 degrees Celsius. However, the construction of Projects 0190 and 0230 has not been affected, and several major processes have exceeded their monthly plans. For example, the concrete pouring volume of Project 0230 exceeded the target by 35 percent, sanitary pipe laying exceeded by 10 percent, mechanical installation exceeded by 6 percent, and electrical pipe laying exceeded by 7 percent. The concrete pouring volume of Project 0190 exceeded the target by 4 percent, and sanitary pipe laying exceeded by 2 percent. Currently, both projects have basically completed the concrete pouring stage and are proceeding with large-scale mechanical and electrical installation at an astonishing speed. When Anshan Iron and Steel's two projects began winter construction, some people considered it "risky" and worried about guaranteeing quality. However, the facts of more than a month have completely shattered this argument. More than 3,000 cubic meters of concrete were used for the eleventh foundation of Project 0190 during winter construction (more than the concrete used to build a four-story building of 10,000 square meters), and the compressive strength fully met the design standards. The quality of the winter construction part of the twelfth foundation of the project was even better than the part constructed in September.
    Winter construction is more arduous for workers. However, the Anshan Iron and Steel construction workers, who have a high sense of responsibility to the country, have not bowed to difficulties. On the contrary, their work enthusiasm is exceptionally high. The platform workers quickly unloaded vehicles in the severe cold of minus ten degrees Celsius, unloading each vehicle of concrete in three or four minutes. Drivers of the all-purpose loaders and unloaders, who transported concrete back and forth between the mixing plant and the construction site, accelerated their driving to maintain the temperature of the mixed concrete. In order to ensure the quality of the project, the ramming workers carefully worked on the densely reinforced equipment foundations, no matter how cold it was. All the staff at the construction sites worked selflessly in this way, ensuring the smooth progress of winter construction.
    Also reported: The main factory building of the new Xi'an Power Plant, under the guidance of Soviet experts, successfully completed the foundation engineering part from December 4th to 8th, and is now tensely carrying out winter construction work.
    Winter construction is still a first in Northwest construction engineering. Thanks to the guidance of Soviet expert Shabino's advanced technology and winter construction experience, the staff overcame many difficulties and completed the project tasks according to schedule. Inspired by the advanced Soviet experience, employees of all trades have overcome the cold and continuously improved construction efficiency. Steelworkers achieved a record of one ton per worker per day in reinforcing steel, an increase of more than 80 percent over the quota. Carpenters saved seven workdays in the project of installing the foundation formwork for the two boiler bases. After improving labor organization, the team of ordinary workers Xu Tianshun, Zhu Cunchang, and others improved the efficiency of pouring concrete for the boiler bases. Riggers and mechanical road builders also created new records in the red flag competition.
    In order to do a good job in the construction work of the coming severe winter, the staff are further strengthening insulation equipment. Some straw, gloves, rubber shoes, coal stoves, etc., have been purchased; water heating equipment has been installed; and warm sheds and concrete mixing rooms have also been built. Hoists and other high-altitude operation tools are being actively allocated. In addition, workers are also brewing the implementation of a responsibility system.

### 鞍钢两大工程冬季施工成绩良好  西安发电厂新建工程紧张进行冬季施工

    鞍钢两大工程冬季施工成绩良好
    西安发电厂新建工程紧张进行冬季施工
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司○一九○和○二三○两大工程，冬季施工成绩良好。
    十一月份以来，寒流屡袭鞍山，气温最低曾降到摄氏零下十五度半。但○一九○和○二三○两大工程的施工，并未受到影响，几个主要工序都超额完成了月计划。如○二三○工程混凝土灌浇量超过任务百分之三十五，卫生管道敷设超过百分之十，机械安装超过百分之六，电气管道敷设超过百分之七。○一九○工程混凝土灌浇量超过任务百分之四，卫生管道敷设超过百分之二。目前，该两项工程基本上已结束混凝土浇灌阶段，正以惊人的速度进行大规模的机械安装和电气安装。鞍钢这两项工程开始实行冬季施工时，有些人曾认为是“冒险”，担心保证不了质量。但一个多月来的事实完全打破了这一论调。○一九○工程第十一号基础实行冬季施工的有三千多立方公尺混凝土
    （比建造一座一万平方公尺的四层大楼所用的混凝土还多），耐压强度完全达到了设计标准。该工程第十二号基础冬季施工部分的质量，还比九月份施工的部分好。
    进行冬季施工，对工人来讲，是比较艰苦的。但对国家具有高度责任心的鞍钢建筑工人，并未向困难低头。相反地，他们的工作情绪异常高涨。站板工人们在摄氏零下十余度的严寒中进行快速卸车，每车混凝土在三、四分钟内就卸完。满载混凝土往来奔驰于搅拌厂与工地之间的万能装卸车驾驶员们，则加快行驶，以保持搅拌后的混凝土的温度。捣固工人们为了保证工程质量，不管多么寒冷，都在钢筋密集的设备基础上仔细进行工作。各工地中所有工作人员都这样忘我地劳动，保证了冬季施工的顺利进行。
    又讯：西安发电厂新建工程主要厂房部分，在苏联专家指导下，于十二月四日至八日胜利完成基础工程部分，现正紧张进行冬季施工工作。
    冬季施工，在西北建筑工程中还是第一次。由于苏联专家沙比诺的先进技术和冬季施工经验的指导，职工们克服了许多困难，按照进度完成了工程任务。各个工种的职工在苏联先进经验的鼓舞下，战胜寒冷，不断提高了施工效率。钢筋工在扎钢筋的工作中，每天每工达到一吨的成绩，比定额提高百分之八十以上。木工在安装两个锅炉基座地脚模板的工程中，节省了七个工。普通工许天顺、竹存昌等小组，改进劳动组织以后，提高了浇灌锅炉基座混凝土的效率。搭架工人、机械筑路工人，在红旗竞赛中，也创造了新的纪录。
    为了做好严冬即将到来的施工工作，职工们正进一步加强保温设备。部分稻草、手套、胶鞋、煤炉等，已经购置妥当；烧水设备已安装起来；暖棚、混凝土搅拌房也搭好了；卷扬机等高空作业工具正在积极调配。此外，工人们还正在酝酿推行责任制。
