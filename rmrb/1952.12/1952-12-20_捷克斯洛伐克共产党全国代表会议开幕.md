    Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The National Conference of the Czechoslovak Communist Party opened on the 16th. Portraits of Stalin and Klement Gottwald hung in the conference hall. Between the portraits was a banner that read: "Learn from the example of the glorious Lenin-Stalin party, closely unite around Comrade Gottwald, and advance towards socialism!"
    The conference was declared open by Antonín Zápotocký. He said: The resolutions of the National Conference will consolidate the unity of the Party and make it more closely united; no matter how mad our class enemies are, the Party will lead all Party members to new victories in defending peace and building socialism. Zápotocký also said: We can take on the title of "shock brigade" that Stalin spoke of at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We will work with the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and the entire progressive peace camp to shatter the heinous plans of the warmongers and jointly defend peace! The delegates responded to these words with enthusiastic applause. Then, the meeting elected the Presidium of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, headed by Gottwald, as the Presidium of the Party's National Conference, and unanimously approved the conference agenda. Subsequently, all those present stood up and listened silently to the reading of the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the National Conference. After the reading, the entire hall cheered "Long live the Soviet Union! Long live Comrade Stalin!" for a long time.
    Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda: "The Party's political and organizational work and the draft of the new Party Constitution." He narrated the lessons learned from the exposure and elimination of the Slánský gang, the achievements of the Party's work, and the Party's future tasks in the national economy. He also pointed out the problems in the Party's work and explained the draft of the new Party Constitution. Gottwald spoke about how the Party dealt with traitors and how it would pursue them to the end in the future. He also spoke about the Party's invincible strength. He received particularly warm support from those present when he said these words. In conclusion, Gottwald pointed out that the Party's tasks can and will be accomplished because the Party has the help of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin himself. As he concluded his report, a storm of cheers paying tribute to Comrade Stalin and Comrade Gottwald resounded throughout the hall again.
    Those who spoke in the discussion included Bedřich Kosek, First Deputy Secretary of the Prague Regional Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Josef Juran, Chairman of the Brno Regional Committee, and Karel Bacílek, Minister of National Security of the Czechoslovak Republic.

    捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议开幕
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议在十六日开幕。会场里挂着斯大林和克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的画像。在画像之间是一幅标语：“学习光荣的列宁—斯大林党的榜样，紧密地团结在哥特瓦尔德同志的周围，向社会主义前进！”
    会议由安托宁·萨波托斯基宣布开幕。他说：全国代表会议的决议将巩固党的统一，使党更紧密地团结起来；不管我们的阶级敌人如何疯狂，党将领导全党党员走向保卫和平与建设社会主义事业的新胜利。萨波托斯基又说：我们能够担当起斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所说的“突击队”的称号。我们要和苏联、各人民民主共和国以及整个进步的和平阵营一起粉碎战争贩子的罪恶计划，共同保卫和平！代表们对这些话报以热烈鼓掌。接着会上选出了以哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团为党全国代表会议主席团，并一致通过了会议议程。随后到会的人全体起立，静听宣读苏联共产党中央委员会致代表会议的贺电。读毕，全场欢呼“苏联万岁！斯大林同志万岁！”，经久不息。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席哥特瓦尔德在会上作了关于议程第一项“党的政治工作和组织工作以及新党章草案”的报告。他叙述了从揭露和铲除斯兰斯基匪帮一事中所获得的教训、党的工作所获得的成绩和今后党在国民经济方面的任务。他还指出了党的工作中的问题，并解释了新党章草案。哥特瓦尔德谈到了党在如何对付叛徒和将来如何追击他们到底，也谈到了党的不可克服的力量；他说这些话时获得了到会的人特别热烈的拥护。哥特瓦尔德在结语中指出：党的任务是一定可以完成的，这些任务之所以能够完成是因为党有着苏联和斯大林同志本人的帮助。在他结束报告时，全场再度响起了暴风雨般的向斯大林同志和哥特瓦尔德同志致敬的欢呼声。
    在讨论中发言的有：捷共布拉格州委会第一副书记贝德里赫·科塞尔卡、布尔诺州委会主席约瑟夫·尤朗以及捷克斯洛伐克共和国国家保安部部长卡列尔·巴契列克。
