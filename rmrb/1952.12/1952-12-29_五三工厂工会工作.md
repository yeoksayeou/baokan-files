Trade Union Work at the 53rd Factory
Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Dong Xin

The trade union work at the 53rd Factory has accumulated rich experience, which is worthy of reference and learning by trade unions in various factories and mines.

The first experience of the trade union work at the 53rd Factory is that, under the unified leadership of the Party, the trade union organization, with production as the center, mobilizes the masses and organizes labor emulation drives to complete and exceed the state production tasks. Over the past three years, emulation has become the working method and lifestyle of the factory's workers. The basic methods used by the factory to organize emulation drives are as follows:

	I. Continuously conduct patriotic education, explain the political and economic significance of the state production plan to the workers; mobilize workers to discuss administrative plans and study how to overfulfill state tasks; based on the workers' awareness, the trade union mobilizes workers to formulate individual plans, turning the state plan into workers' specific goals. Groups formulate patriotic pledges, stipulating in the patriotic pledges: improving quality, saving raw materials, reducing costs, caring for machines, complying with technical operating procedures, and organizing technical mutual assistance. The group's patriotic pledge also includes the group's current problems hindering production, and stipulates that they should be resolved within a certain period. At the same time, a systematic inspection system for the group's patriotic pledge should be established to avoid it being unrealistic and perfunctory. Groups, work procedures, and workshops also have contact contracts with each other, cooperating and supervising each other to ensure that production proceeds evenly and rhythmically. The trade union and the administration have a collective contract to combine the development of production with the improvement of workers' lives. The collective contract organizes everyone in the enterprise under one goal, with unified thinking and unified pace. Through the formulation of group pledges and contract system, the factory's emulation has become regularized, thereby promoting the enterprise's management onto the right track and ensuring the completion of the state plan.

	II. Combine labor with technology. The trade union carries out the rationalization proposal movement in the emulation, mobilizing workers to improve tools, improve labor organization, and improve operating methods. The trade union grasps the central link of promoting advanced experience, assists the administrative organization in having technical personnel and staff go down to the workshop to help realize workers' rationalization proposals. The factory adopts the "topic reward" method to give rationalization proposals a clear goal, and seizes the decisive and key advanced experience, uses the Kovalev working method to summarize it, and systematically promotes it. The methods for promoting advanced experience are:

		(1) Conduct investigation and research to understand the masses' understanding, interest and concerns about advanced experience, as well as the role of certain old ideas and prejudices among them, and adopt an enlightening and inductive method to educate and improve, rather than using simplified and crude working methods to promote advanced experience.
		(2) Summarize the deeds of advanced producers from both technical and ideological aspects, and provide typical demonstrations, conduct ideological education with living people and living events among the masses, and dispel the masses' concerns.
		(3) Immediately organize mass discussions after the typical report, carry out criticism and self-criticism, criticize conservative ideas, establish advanced ideas, and formulate individual plans for learning advanced experience.
		(4) Strengthen the technical learning of the workers, organize technical personnel to cooperate with workers, comprehensively integrate various important advanced experiences, compile teaching materials, explain by technical personnel, and perform and impart by advanced producers.
		(5) Assist the administration in modifying and supplementing technical operating procedures with reference to advanced experience.

	III. Combine emulation with improving the operation and management of enterprises. According to the different requirements of the administrative aspects at each period, the trade union puts forward different slogans and adopts different forms of competition to realize them. For example, when the administration proposes quotas, the trade union organizes the workers to carry out the new record movement, and compiles teaching materials to conduct quota education among the workers. When implementing quota management, the trade union launched the group pledge movement. In the production increase and economy practice, the trade union put forward the slogan of finding "tricks" and launched a competition movement, etc., aimed at quality inspection.

	IV. Conduct vivid propaganda and mobilization work in the competition, such as proposing the popular and easy-to-understand "Tricks Courtyard" in the production increase and economy movement, encouraging the masses to put forward rationalization proposals, urging technical personnel to unite and cooperate with the workers, and creating lively and timely reporting stations and other diverse and ideological mobilization methods, so that the masses always maintain full enthusiasm.

The second experience of the trade union work at the 53rd Factory is to care about the lives of the masses, correctly implement government labor protection laws, and actively assist the administration in doing a good job in labor protection. Labor protection work has become one of the regular and important tasks of the trade union organization, so that employees can actively produce without any worries. Establish a regular inspection system, and the trade union promptly puts forward suggestions to the administration when it finds problems, and assists in solving them. For some problems, the trade union mobilizes the masses to solve them themselves. Over the past three years, the trade union has mobilized the masses to solve many technical safety equipment problems by themselves using waste materials, effectively preventing accidents. For relatively large and difficult problems, the trade union recommends that the administration solve them or stipulate them in the collective contract, mobilize workers to increase production, and then the administration finds ways to solve them. And frequently educate the workers, so that employees pay attention to safety, comply with operating procedures and labor discipline, and give awards to accident-free workshop groups.

For any welfare measures in the factory, the trade union widely solicits the opinions of employees and their families, and systematically solves them according to the needs of the masses and actual possibilities. Those that cannot be resolved are also clearly explained to the employees, and at the same time, the trade union frequently cares about the suffering of the masses, and frequently inspects and improves the existing welfare facilities. The workers' vital problems, as long as they can be resolved, the trade union proactively solves them without waiting for the masses to make requests. Important issues are also discussed and decided at the Party committee meeting and solved separately. The daily improvement of the workers' material and cultural life closely links personal interests with national interests. This is concrete communist education for the workers, improving the political consciousness of the employees, and encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the employees, thereby improving labor productivity. Material life and cultural life will then have greater improvements.

The trade union earnestly promotes a reasonable wage system and reward system, assists the administration in formulating reasonable quotas, and correctly uses enterprise reward funds, and stipulates reward methods according to different tasks in each period. Whether material or honorary rewards, they are timely, flexible, and take care of all aspects, and can reflect policies and leadership intentions. Each award is discussed by the masses. At the end of each movement and at the quarterly work summary meeting, the factory holds a grand award ceremony, and sometimes even absorbs family members to participate. This not only encourages the advanced, but also educates the laggards.

The third experience of the trade union work at the 53rd Factory is that frequently carrying out systematic political, cultural, and technical education to improve the political awareness and technical proficiency of employees is an important key to doing a good job in production. Under the leadership of the Party, the factory trade union has conducted systematic communist and communist party education to the workers since liberation, and combined current affairs and major political movements to carry out various educations. For example, in the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, patriotic and internationalist education was carried out; in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, education on clearing out enemy agents and safeguarding national interests was carried out; in the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis", systematic education on understanding the nature of the bourgeoisie was carried out, etc. Frequently combine various movements, carry out patriotic education through various meetings and forms of propaganda and mobilization. Under the leadership of the Party, expose and criticize various erroneous ideas and establish communist ideas in response to the different ideological situations of employees and cadres. Adopt methods such as apprenticeship contracts, technical research associations; promote advanced experience, and learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and brother factories to conduct technical education. Cultural learning is mainly running spare time schools.

The fourth experience of the trade union work at the 53rd Factory is the signing of collective contracts. In the 53rd Factory, the collective contract has become a concentrated expression of the factory's task of completing production, life, and education as a trinity. It is the common program of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League, and it is a means to organize continuously rising labor enthusiasm. It makes the goals of the labor emulation drive clear, regular and lasting, and also promotes the gradual and planned improvement of business management. The content of the collective contract is completely consistent with the central task of each period. The center of the movement is the center of the contract, and it is closely combined with improving business management. For example, the second quarter contract in 1951 stipulated a large quality inspection, the third quarter was production increase and economy practice, and the fourth quarter was strengthening workshop work. The specific method of signing the collective contract is that the administration puts forward the production plan for the current period, the current key, specific requirements, and specific solutions to problems. The trade union then puts forward ways to mobilize the masses to realize the state plan, and widely solicits the opinions of employees and their families on labor protection and welfare requirements and puts forward opinions on solving safety and health and collective welfare, and then the drafts of both parties are studied in the "brainstorming meeting" and integrated into a draft, which is submitted to the higher authorities on one hand, and distributed to cadres and the masses on the other hand to solicit opinions. According to the opinions of the masses and the higher authorities, the administration and the trade union finally revise it into a formal contract draft, and hold a grand signing ceremony at the factory-wide employee meeting. At the meeting, the factory director summarizes the implementation of the previous contract, and awards are given at the same time. At this conference, the trade union launched a workers' competition.

Finally, the experience of the trade union at the 53rd Factory is that the trade union organization, under the leadership of the Party, has adopted correct working methods, properly allocated spare time, and established a scientific working system. This is also an important reason for ensuring the smooth progress of the trade union work.

    五三工厂工会工作
    中华全国总工会政策研究室副主任　董昕
    五三工厂的工会工作，积累了丰富的经验，是值得各厂矿工会参考和学习的。
    五三工厂工会工作的第一个经验，是工会组织在党的统一领导下，以生产为中心，发动群众，组织劳动竞赛，以完成与超过国家生产任务。三年来竞赛已成为该厂工人群众的劳动方式与生活方式。该厂组织竞赛的基本方法如下：
    一、不断地进行爱国主义教育，向职工群众解释国家生产计划的政治意义与经济意义；发动职工讨论行政计划，研究如何超额完成国家任务；在工人自觉的基础上，工会发动工人订个人计划，把国家计划变成为工人具体的奋斗目标。小组订立小组爱国公约，在爱国公约中规定：提高质量，节约原材料，降低成本，爱护机器，遵守技术操作规程和组织技术互助。小组爱国公约也包括小组当前存在的妨碍生产的问题，并规定要在一定时间内予以解决。同时要规定系统的对小组爱国公约的检查制度，避免其不切实际和流于形式。小组与小组，工序与工序，车间与车间之间，还订有联系合同，互相配合，互相督促，使生产均衡地有节奏地进行。工会、行政方面，订有集体合同，使发展生产与改善职工生活相结合。集体合同把企业中一切人员组织在一个目标下，思想一致，步调一致。经过订小组公约与合同制度，该厂的竞赛已经经常化，从而推动企业管理走上轨道，保证国家计划的完成。
    二、劳动与技术相结合。工会在竞赛中开展合理化建议运动，发动工人改进工具，改善劳动组织，改善操作方法。工会抓住推广先进经验这一中心环节，协助行政组织技术人员及职员下车间，帮助实现工人的合理化建议。该厂采用“课题悬赏”办法使合理化建议有明确的目标，并抓住有决定意义的关键性的先进经验，采用郭瓦廖夫工作方法进行总结，有计划地加以推广。推广先进经验的方法是：
    （一）进行调查研究，了解群众对先进经验的认识、兴趣和顾虑，以及某些旧思想成见在他们中间的作用，采取启发诱导的方法去教育提高，而不是用简单化和粗暴的工作方式去推广先进经验。（二）把先进生产者的事迹从技术与思想两方面加以总结，典型示范，在群众中拿活人活事进行思想教育，解除群众顾虑。（三）典型报告之后，立即组织群众讨论，开展批评与自我批评，批判保守思想，树立先进思想，订立个人学习先进经验的计划。
    （四）加强工人群众的技术学习，组织技术人员与工人合作，综合各种重要先进经验，编写教材，由技术人员讲解，由先进生产者表演、传授。（五）协助行政参照先进经验，修改补助技术操作规程。
    三、竞赛与改善企业的经营管理相结合。根据每个时期行政方面的不同要求，工会提出不同的口号，采取不同的竞赛形式，予以实现。如行政提出定额，工会即组织工人群众开展新纪录运动，并编写教材，在工人群众中进行定额教育。实行定额管理时，工会开展了小组公约运动。在增产节约运动中，针对质量检查，工会提出找“窍门”的口号和开展了竞赛运动等等。
    四、竞赛中进行生动的宣传鼓动工作，如增产节约运动中提出通俗易解的“窍门大院”，鼓动群众提合理化建议，促请技术人员与工人群众团结合作，创造了活泼及时的报捷站以及其他多种多样的具有思想性的鼓动方式，使群众经常保持饱满的情绪。
    五三工厂工会工作的第二个经验，是关心群众生活，正确执行政府劳动保护法令，积极协助行政，做好劳动保护工作。劳动保护工作成为工会组织经常的重要任务之一，使职工毫无顾虑地积极生产。建立经常的检查制度，工会发现问题及时向行政提出建议，并协助解决。有些问题，工会发动群众自己解决。三年来工会发动群众自己动手利用废料，解决了不少技术安全设备问题，有效地防止了事故。比较大的困难问题，工会建议行政解决或规定到集体合同中去，发动工人增加生产然后由行政设法解决。并经常对工人群众进行教育，使职工注意安全，遵守操作规程与劳动纪律，并给与无事故的车间小组以奖励。
    该厂任何有关福利的措施，工会都广泛征求了职工及家属的意见，根据群众需要和实际的可能，系统地加以解决。不能解决的也向职工交代清楚，同时经常关心群众的疾苦，对于已有的福利设施经常检查和改善。工人群众的切身问题，只要可能解决，工会不等群众提出要求，即主动地加以解决。重要问题，还在党委会上讨论决定，分头解决，工人群众的物质生活与文化生活的日益改善，就把个人利益与国家利益紧密地联系起来，这就是对工人群众进行了具体的共产主义教育，提高了职工群众的政治觉悟，鼓舞了职工的劳动热情，从而提高了劳动生产率。物质生活与文化生活又随之有更大的改善。
    工会认真推行合理的工资制度与奖励制度，协助行政制定合理的定额，并正确运用企业奖励基金，根据各个时期不同的任务规定奖励办法。不论物质或荣誉奖励，都及时、灵活、照顾到各个方面，能够体现政策和领导意图。每次评奖都经过群众讨论，在每次运动结束和每季的工作总结大会时，该厂举行隆重的发奖大会，有时还吸收家属参加。这不仅使先进者得到了鼓励，落后者也得到教育。
    五三工厂工会的第三个经验，是经常进行系统的政治、文化、技术教育，提高职工政治觉悟和技术熟练程度，是搞好生产的重要关键，该厂工会在党的领导下，自解放后即向工人进行了系统的共产主义与共产党的教育，结合时事和重大政治运动进行各种教育。如抗美援朝运动中进行爱国主义与国际主义教育；镇压反革命运动中进行肃清敌探维护国家利益的教育；“三反”“五反”中进行了系统的认识资产阶级本质的教育等等。经常结合各种运动，通过各种会议以及宣传鼓动的形式进行爱国主义教育。在党的领导下针对职工干部不同思想情况，揭发与批判各种错误思想，树立共产主义思想。采取师徒合同，技术研究会；推广先进经验，学习苏联经验与兄弟工厂的经验等方式进行技术教育。文化学习主要是办业余学校。
    五三工厂工会的第四个经验是订立集体合同。在五三工厂，集体合同成为该厂完成生产、生活、教育三位一体的任务的集中的表现。是党、行政、工会、青年团的共同纲领，是组织劳动热情不断高涨的手段。它使劳动竞赛的目标明确、经常持久，也推动经营管理逐步地有计划地改进。集体合同的内容与每个时期中心任务完全一致。运动的中心即合同的中心，并紧密地与改善经营管理相结合，如一九五一年第二季度合同规定是质量大检查，第三季度是增产节约，第四季度是加强车间工作。签订集体合同的具体方法是由行政提出本期的生产计划、当前关键、具体要求及解决问题的具体办法，工会则提出动员群众实现国家计划的办法，并广泛征求职工及家属关于劳动保护福利的要求和意见，提出解决安全卫生与集体福利方面的意见，然后把双方的草案在“碰头会”上加以研究，综合为一个草案，一面呈报上级，一面分发到干部与群众中去征求意见。根据群众和上级的意见行政和工会最后修改为正式合同草案，召开全厂职工大会举行隆重的签字仪式。会上由厂长总结上期合同执行的情况，并同时发奖。在这个大会上，工会发动工人竞赛。
    最后，五三工厂工会的经验，是工会组织在党的领导下，采取了正确的工作方法，妥善地支配了业余时间，建立了科学的工作制度，这也是保证工会工作顺利进行的一个重要原因。
