The Line Engineering Team of the Electrical Installation and Repair Factory of the Southwest Industrial Department, in the process of installing 6,400 meters of high-voltage lines, learned the "Assembly Line Method for Erecting Poles and Stringing Wires," which reduced the installation time by half.

This advanced work method was learned by Comrade Yang Zhixiang of the factory at the North China Area Electric Power Workers' Advanced Experience Exchange Conference. Before promoting this advanced experience, the trade union convened a mass meeting of workers and staff, where Yang Zhixiang reported on the characteristics of this advanced work method. After the meeting, the trade union and the administration signed a collective contract to complete the 6,400-meter wiring project in ten days with 680 workdays.

After the collective contract was signed, some workers believed that "it would be difficult to implement." On October 15th of this year, when the factory started installing the first wooden pole using the "Assembly Line Method for Erecting Poles and Stringing Wires," the pulley position was installed incorrectly, which delayed the time. An old worker said: "Using this experience will not improve efficiency." However, soon, this idea of ​​disbelieving in advanced experience was immediately corrected by the facts. When implementing this advanced experience, the factory divided the labor organization into six groups: digging holes,搬运 (bānyùn)搬运, assembling, erecting poles, laying wires, and 收线 (shōuxiàn)收线. After the digging team dug the holes, the搬运 team immediately搬运搬运 the equipment to the side of the holes, the assembly team immediately installed the iron crossarms, magnetic bottles, etc. on the wooden poles, the erection team then erected the wooden poles, the laying wire team climbed onto the wooden poles, installed the pulleys and放线 (fàngxiàn)放线, and finally the 收线 team tied the wires, completing the entire work of erecting the poles and加线 (jiāxiàn)加线. Each group was closely connected in sequence, advancing like a stream, no longer like before when everyone squeezed together around a wooden pole, doing one wooden pole and then starting on the second one, resulting in a waste of manpower and time. In this way, the factory completed the installation task ahead of schedule, reducing the installation time by half. The workers who used to disbelieve in the Assembly Line Method for Erecting Poles and Stringing Wires all said: "The past view was too conservative. In the future, we must humbly learn from advanced experience to do the installation work better."

Additionally: The Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau's factories and mines neglect mechanical installation work, and therefore cannot complete the installation tasks.

The factories and mines under the bureau have no dedicated personnel to manage equipment. The Tianbaoshan Mine wanted to install a 150-horsepower ball mill. The original design stipulated that the electric roller should have ten poles, but the mine mistakenly wrote eight poles when requesting equipment. After this electric roller was transported to the mine, the mine did not have a dedicated person to accept and inspect it until it was installed and put into operation, only then was the error discovered. They had to disassemble it again and request ten poles separately. This not only wasted labor and materials, but also postponed production by half a month. The allocation of equipment in the factories and mines under the bureau is also very chaotic. This year, both the Mining Machinery Factory and the Processing Factory planned to install a universal grinder, but when allocating, they mistakenly allocated both to the Mining Machinery Factory. The Mining Machinery Factory did not care how many were originally planned, and installed both of them, so that the Processing Factory has not completed the installation task of this universal grinder to this day. Some factories and mines do not conduct research and inspection when using old equipment, and immediately start construction. For example, the capacity of the substation of the Ore Dressing Agent Factory is insufficient and does not meet the safety regulations, so it needs to be modified. Therefore, construction started at the end of August this year, and the installation work was completed at the end of September. After inspection, it was found that the oil-filled switch had insufficient voltage resistance, and the voltage transformer and circuit breaker did not meet the specifications; they had to be disassembled and new equipment purchased. In this way, the construction time was delayed for more than a month.

In view of the above situation, the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau specially sent a working group to the various units to supervise and inspect, and issued instructions requiring all units to strengthen the leadership of installation work in the fourth quarter, earnestly check and inventory the equipment situation, so as to have a clear understanding and plan the construction to complete the annual basic construction plan.

    学习先进安装方法安装时间缩短一半
    东北有色金属管理局各厂矿不重视机械安装工作
    西南工业部电气安装修配工厂线路工程队，在安装六千四百公尺高压线路的工程中，学习了“立杆架线工作流水作业法”，把安装时间缩短了一半。
    这一先进工作法，是该厂杨治祥同志在华北区电业职工先进经验交流大会中学到的。该厂在推广这一先进经验以前，工会召开了职工群众大会，由杨治祥报告这一先进工作法的特点。会后，工会和行政方面签订了以六百八十个工十天完成六千四百公尺架线工程的集体合同。
    集体合同签订后，部分工人认为“实行起来有困难”。在今年十月十五日该厂用“立杆架线工作流水作业法”，开始安装第一根木杆时，装错了滑轮位置，耽误了时间。有一个老工人就说：“用这个经验，是不能提高效率的。”但是不久，这种不相信先进经验的思想立即为事实纠正了。该厂在实行这个先进经验时，把劳动组织分为：打洞、搬运、组装、立杆、放线、收线等六个组。打洞组打好了洞，搬运组立即把器材搬到洞侧，组装组紧接着就把铁横担、磁瓶等安装在木杆上，立杆组随即立起木杆，放线组就爬上木杆装好滑轮放线，最后收线组扎线，完成全部立杆加线的工作。每组都依次序紧紧衔接，像流水一样前进，再不像从前那样大家挤在一堆，共同围着一根木杆，做好一根木杆后，再开始做第二根，以致浪费人力与时间了。这样，该厂提前完成了安装的任务，把安装时间缩短了一半。过去不相信立杆架线工作流水作业法的工人们都说：“过去的看法太保守了，今后要虚心学习先进经验，把安装工作做得更好。”
    又讯：东北有色金属管理局各厂矿，忽视机械安装工作，因而不能完成安装任务。
    该局所属各厂、矿没有专人管理设备。天宝山矿要安装一台一百五十马力的球磨机，原设计规定电滚是十极的，但该矿在请拨设备时却误写为八极的。这台电滚运到该矿后，该矿也没有专人验收和检查，直到安装好，进行运转时，才发现错误，只好又拆下来，另请拨十极的。这不但浪费了人工和材料，并且推迟生产半个月。该局所属厂、矿调拨设备的工作也是很混乱的。今年矿山机械厂和加工厂都计划安装一台万能磨床，但调拨时却误将两台都拨到矿山机械厂去了。矿山机械厂也不管原计划是几台，把两台都安装了起来，以致加工厂到今天还没有完成这台万能磨床的安装任务。有些厂、矿利用旧设备时，不进行研究，检验，即行施工。比如选矿剂工厂的变电所容量不够，又不合乎保安规程，需要修改，因之在今年八月末开始动工，到九月末才完成安装工作。后经检查，又发现油入开闭器耐压不够，电压变成器和断路器都不合乎规格；只得重新拆下来，采购新的设备。这样，又拖延了一个月以上的施工时间。
    东北有色金属管理局根据上述情况，特派了一个工作小组到各单位进行督促检查，并发出指示，要求各单位在第四季度中必须加强安装工作的领导，切实清点和清查设备的情况，以便作到心中有数和有计划地施工，完成全年基本建设计划。
