The significant achievements in agricultural production in Shanxi Province over the past three years are inseparable from the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union.

In the spring of 1950, Soviet agricultural experts first came to Shanxi to investigate the management of farms in Shanxi Province and put forward some valuable suggestions for reforming agricultural technology. The most important of these were the close planting of cotton and wheat, and crop rotation with grass fields. That year, we conducted experiments on farms, followed by effective promotion work in various regions. Currently, close planting of cotton and wheat has become one of the main measures for farmers to achieve high yields. Shanxi has traditionally practiced wide-row, sparse planting of cotton and wheat. Close planting of cotton and wheat is indeed a major reform in cultivation methods. After Qu Yaoli, under the guidance of the Yuncheng Farm, used advanced Soviet experience to create a national record of 912 catties of cotton per mu, it further confirmed that the Soviet close planting experience was completely correct and also proved the scientific truth that "there is no bad land, only bad cultivation techniques." In 1952, close planting of cotton was universally implemented throughout Shanxi Province, with an average of 3,200 to 4,000 plants per mu in cotton fields. As a result, more cotton high-yield models and large-area high-yield units have emerged this year. The experience of close planting of grain crops has also been widely promoted. Millet has increased from 7,000 to 8,000 plants per mu to 12,000 to 32,000 plants. Thirty percent of wheat fields in the province have adopted the cultivation methods of close row and close planting, widened sowing width, and increased sowing quantity. The scientific principles that some crops can achieve high yields, prevent drought and conserve moisture, and limit weed growth after close planting have been accepted by most farmers and have become the main technical conditions for striving for high yields.

Drought prevention and moisture conservation are important tasks for achieving a good harvest in the arid areas of Shanxi. After Soviet agricultural expert Ivanov came to Shanxi for investigation, he clearly pointed out the possibility of drought prevention and moisture conservation and instructed the methods of drought prevention and moisture conservation. Deep plowing and fine harrowing, applying more organic fertilizer, cultivating soil aggregate structure, and especially implementing crop rotation with grass fields are all advanced Soviet experiences that have been proven effective in drought prevention and moisture conservation. Now, except for crop rotation with grass fields, which is still being tested on farms and has not yet been promoted, other experiences have been put into practice among the masses and have achieved initial results.

How to effectively and scientifically increase fertilizer was one of the problems we found difficult to solve. Under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, we have found some solutions. We know that if we can take advantage of the favorable conditions of mountainous areas to produce large quantities of compost, promote the use of bean cake to feed pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and plant large quantities of green manure, we can not only increase a large amount of fertilizer to supply crop nutrition but also improve soil structure and increase soil fertility. According to the practical experience of high-yield models in some areas, if we can widely promote advanced technologies such as appropriate close planting, drought prevention and moisture conservation, and increased organic fertilizer in a short period of time, the yield can be immediately increased several times. If we can further implement the crop rotation system with grass fields, the yield can be greatly increased. Our learning of advanced Soviet experience is only just beginning, but it has already achieved amazing results. This cannot but be said to be a major event in the history of our agricultural development.

In terms of animal husbandry, in order to improve horse breeds, we purchased 75 horses of various Kustanaiskaya breeds from the Soviet Union in May 1950. We used 40 of the stallions, successively set up 19 breeding stations in Linfen, Jiexian, Changzhi, Fanshi, Fenyang, and other places. In 1951, they mated with 2,000 mares, and in 1952, they mated with 3,900 mares, and it is estimated that 40 percent could become foals. The remaining 35 mares have produced 52 foals in the past two years. In order to help us improve feeding management and breeding technology, in the spring of 1951, Soviet experts Luo Yiciji and others personally came to Shanxi and taught advanced Soviet experience in breeding technology and feeding management. As a result, the conception rate of horses on the farm increased from 40 percent to 100 percent, and all foals survived. In order to expand the scope of fine breed breeding, under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, we have also established a stallion artificial insemination station and a ram artificial insemination station. At present, the masses are using Soviet stallions to improve local horse breeds, laying a good foundation for the use of tractor-drawn farm implements. In addition, Soviet alfalfa is being tested in Shanxi, with a yield of more than 10,000 catties per mu, which is twice the yield of local alfalfa; Soviet fodder radish is planted in Shanxi, with a yield of 20,950 catties per mu this year. We are also promoting these good fodder varieties.

However, it must be pointed out that our learning of advanced Soviet experience is still far from enough. Some agricultural technicians are still reluctant to part with the set of bourgeois decadent and backward things they have learned in the past. They do not understand that only by resolutely abandoning the old can they learn the new. Because of this, when they learn advanced Soviet experience and use Soviet experience to improve their work, they show intolerable slowness and lack of effectiveness. This must be overcome immediately.

Many farmer cadres and intellectual cadres from rural areas reflect the conservative thinking and empiricism of farmers. They lack scientific attitude and innovative thinking. They are not quick to accept new things and are unwilling to adopt new technologies. This is also a serious ideological obstacle to learning advanced Soviet experience and should be quickly corrected. All of us agricultural workers should study advanced Soviet experience well and widely apply advanced Soviet experience to practical work, which is of decisive significance for our large-scale agricultural construction that is about to begin.

    苏联的先进农业科学经验在山西发生了巨大作用
    武光汤
    三年来山西省农业生产获得的重大成就，是和苏联的友谊帮助分不开的。
    一九五○年春，苏联农业专家第一次来到山西，考察了山西省农场的经营状况，提出了若干改革农业技术的宝贵意见。最主要的有棉花、小麦的密植和草田轮作等。当年我们就在农场做了试验，接着在各地进行了有效的推广工作，目前棉麦密植已成为广大农民取得丰产的主要措施之一。山西历来实行棉、麦宽垅稀植的耕作方法，棉麦密植，确是耕作方法的一个重大的改革。曲耀离在运城农场的指导下，采用苏联的先进经验，创造了棉花每亩产九百一十二斤的全国最高纪录之后，更证实了苏联密植经验是完全正确的，也证明了“没有不良的土地，只有不良的耕作技术”的科学道理。一九五二年，山西全省的棉花普遍做到了密植，一般棉田每亩都种植三千二百株到四千株。因此，今年涌现了更多的棉花丰产模范，和大面积的丰产单位。粮食作物密植经验也已普遍推广。谷子由每亩七、八千株增至一万二千至三万二千株。全省有百分之三十的麦田推广了密行密植、加宽播幅、增加播量的耕作方法。某些作物实行密植后可以丰产、可以防旱保墒、可以限制杂草生长的科学道理，已为大部分农民所接受，成为争取丰产的主要技术条件。
    防旱保墒是山西干旱地区争取丰收的重要任务之
    一。苏联农业专家伊万诺夫来到山西考察以后，明确地提出了防旱保墒的可能性，并指示了防旱保墒的办法。深耕细耙、多施有机肥料、培养土壤的团粒组织、特别是实行草田轮作，都是苏联行之有效的防旱保墒的先进经验。现在除草田轮作尚在农场试验，还没有推广外，其他各项经验，都已在群众中开始实践，并已获得初步成效。
    如何有效地、科学地增加肥料，曾是我们觉得难于解决的问题之一。在苏联先进经验的指导下，我们已找到了一些解决的办法。我们知道，如能利用山地的有利条件，大量制作堆肥，提倡用豆饼喂猪积肥，大量种植绿肥，则不仅可以增加大量肥料，以供给作物营养，而且可以改良土壤结构，增加地力。根据若干地区丰产模范们实践的经验，如果我们在短时间内把适当密植、防旱保墒、增加有机肥料等先进技术，加以广泛推广，产量立即可以提高数倍。如果能进一步推行草田轮作制，产量更可以大大提高。我们学习苏联的先进经验仅在开始，但已发生了惊人的成就。这不能不说是我们农业发展史上的一件大事。
    在畜牧事业方面，我们为了改良马种，一九五○年五月曾从苏联购买各种古粗马七十五匹。我们用其中的公马四十匹，先后在临汾、解县、长治、繁峙、汾阳等地设立十九处配种站，一九五一年配马两千匹，一九五二年配马三千九百匹，估计可成驹百分之四十。其余三十五匹母马，二年来已产驹五十二匹。为了帮助我们改善饲养管理及配种技术，一九五一年春，苏联专家罗依次基等四人，曾亲自来到山西，传授了苏联的配种技术及饲养管理等方面的先进经验，因此，马场的马匹的受胎率由百分之四十提高到百分之百，小马且全部成活。为了扩大良种繁殖范围，我们在苏联先进经验指导下，又建立了种马人工受精站和种羊人工受精站。目前群众正用苏联种马改良本地马种，为使用马拉机械农具打好基础。此外，苏联的兰花苜蓿正在山西试种中，每亩产量达一万余斤，高出当地苜蓿产量两倍；苏联的饲料萝卜在山西种植，今年每亩产两万零九百五十斤。这些饲料良种，我们也在推广中。
    但必须指出我们学习苏联的先进经验还是十分不够的。某些农业技术人员对于自己过去所学的一套资产阶级的腐朽落后的东西还是恋恋不舍，他们还不懂得只有坚决抛弃旧的，才能学习新的。正因为如此，所以他们在学习苏联先进经验及运用苏联经验来改进工作的时候，就表现了不可容忍的缓慢与缺乏成效的现象。这是必须立即克服的。
    许多农民干部及来至农村的知识分子干部反映了农民的保守思想与经验主义，他们缺乏科学态度与革新思想。接受新鲜事物不快，不愿意采用新的技术。这同样是学习苏联先进经验的严重思想障碍，也应迅速纠正。我们全体农业工作者应该好好地学习苏联的先进经验，把苏联的先进经验广泛的运用到实际工作中来，这对于我们即将开始的大规模农业建设具有决定性的意义。
