Municipal Construction Must Be Unified and Coordinated with Production Construction
    —Anshan Correspondence
    Angang

    The train pulls into Lishan Station, a dozen or so li away from Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel Group). Looking into the distance, the flames from the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant light up half the sky, also warming the hearts of everyone on the train. Everyone on board, including those who have lived in Anshan for a long time, stands up and gazes greedily. People are deeply thrilled by the increase in the power of the people of New China, and cheer for the modern New Angang, which will increase its production several times over in five years.

    ×××

    Anshan is a city concentrated with workers. Among the 380,000 residents, nearly 150,000 are production and capital construction workers, and the rest are mostly workers' families. On the wide asphalt streets, workers' favorite songs are played everywhere, and the good news of workers' production and early completion of tasks are broadcast. Workers pour into the city after work, heading for department stores, bookstores, theaters, cinemas, and night markets…

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the working class of Anshan, while creating great social wealth for the great motherland through selfless labor, has also improved its living standards. Skilled capital construction workers generally earn an average daily wage of around 17 points. One bricklayer created a rapid working method, increasing the quota several times over, and earned a total monthly wage of 3,000 points based on piecework. His achievements quickly became a model for everyone to learn from. When you talk to any ordinary worker, the first thing you feel is their class love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, which flows naturally from their hearts. In the early days of liberation, the working class of Anshan had just ended the days of being oppressed and only receiving a small amount of mixed noodles per month. How sweetly they ate coarse grains then! But now fine grains have become their main food. There was a very short period when more coarse grains were available in the market, and the workers raised their opinions: "We need a large supply of flour. People are used to eating fine grains now." In the past, workers' requirements for daily necessities were "as long as it works," but now they require "beautiful and good quality." A few years ago, watches priced at 600,000 to 700,000 yuan were the most popular among workers, but now such watches have gone from being hot commodities to cold ones. The best-selling watches now are those that are more expensive and of better quality. Leather shoes that are clumsy in shape and lack color can no longer be sold well. Some leather shoe vendors from Sichuan, Hankou, and other places have grasped the psychology of the workers, sending advertisements and samples to the workers from afar, sending stylish shoes first, and then asking you to pay. In the past, workers used cloth to make single-layer or cotton-padded clothes. Now, the Anshan Department Store has more than a dozen storefronts selling different colors and types of clothing fabrics, but they are still in short supply. In the past, workers didn't think about eating sweets, but now this place, which is five or six times larger than the candy and food department of the Beijing Department Store, is crowded with people every day. The turnover of the candy store is now three times greater than in July, but it still cannot meet the needs of the market. State-owned economic departments are preparing to increase candy factories to meet the workers' demands.

    The new situation has presented new demands to trade workers. This means that they must find ways to actively supply the needs of the people, and not lag behind the people's raised demands. For example, for the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, the economic authorities ordered 200,000 jin of mooncakes from outside to supply the market, and were still worried about whether everyone's stomachs could hold them. Only after selling them did they realize that they had ordered too few. Some daily necessities cannot be sold smoothly because they lag behind the workers' demands.

    The Anshan Department Store and cooperatives are responsible for more than 80% of the city's retail sales. Workers' main living needs rely on the state economic departments to solve, and this is the glorious task of Anshan's economic workers to support the construction of Angang. This requires going deep into the lives of the workers to understand their needs. For example, when it gets cold, workers need a large amount of cotton and fur hats, aluminum lunch boxes, cotton shoes and woolen shoes. However, due to insufficient prior estimation this year, there was a shortage of some urgent supplies for a time. In this city of workers, the mode of trade work must suit the needs of the workers. The time when workers go to work and get off work is the same, so their purchases often have great concentration and suddenness. Everyone buys the same kind of materials at the same time, but our store fronts are too few, the variety of goods is too small, there are too few salespersons, and the procedures are too cumbersome. As a result, many people wait and wait until it is time to go to work and have to go away empty-handed.

    Due to large-scale capital construction, the population of Anshan has surged from 190,000 in 1949 to 380,000 this year, which has posed new problems for municipal construction work.

    The housing shortage is serious. A small house often houses two or three families, hotels are packed, and many houses are moved into as soon as they are plastered. But the workers of Anshan have not been intimidated by this difficulty. One college student said: "It is precisely because of the housing shortage that we have come to build." Transportation is insufficient, there are few buses, few routes, and many people have no cars to ride, some have to walk twenty li to and from work. This year, more than forty li of railways for workers have been built, and fifty more li will be built next year. But this still cannot keep up with objective needs. The facts in Anshan prove that transportation construction must be planned to cooperate with large-scale capital construction. This not only requires supplying workers with enough vehicles, but also requires arranging traffic order well. Every day after work, workers' more than 20,000 bicycles, constantly coming and going trains, trucks, cars, and dense crowds are intertwined, and traffic command is a very serious issue. According to statistics, from January to November 15th of this year, a total of 370 various traffic accidents occurred, causing considerable losses to people's lives and property. Anshan is now enthusiastically carrying out "Traffic Safety Month," traffic police have been set up in areas where workers enter and exit intensively, the municipal authorities have also educated car drivers and formulated rewards and punishments, and every evening when workers get off work, people carry paper lanterns (because the roads lack lighting equipment) and stand in the center of the road to direct traffic. Traffic accidents have been reduced.

    Many seemingly small problems, when they become mass problems, exhibit urgent and serious characteristics. Queueing often occurs here, queueing to take pictures, queueing for haircuts, queueing to watch movies, queueing to make clothes... This is a gratifying phenomenon, indicating that the construction of our motherland is booming, and it also tells us: We must speed up the pace of all aspects of work to cooperate with the construction of Angang.

    Workers urgently demand cultural entertainment. Capital construction workers work in three shifts. In addition to work and sleep time, they demand to reasonably and properly allocate rest time. The number of people from all over the country who come to work and study in Angang is increasing day by day, and the city should have a vibrant cultural life to meet everyone's needs and improve them. Bookstores are crowded with people, workers wearing work clothes rush to the China Book Distribution Company after work without changing their clothes to read books such as "Welding Methods" and "Civil Engineering Regulations." A "Technical Norms Principles of Construction Engineering" published by the Northeast Industrial Publishing House placed on the counter of the Xinhua Bookstore is being read avidly. This new book has now become an old book. There are too few types of books in the bookstore to meet people's needs. Books and newspapers are quite lacking here, and Angang workers urgently request that the bookstore organize some mobile book sales teams to carry out retail business here. How to better use the existing books to maximize their effect is also a big problem. For example, the Angang Library closes at the same time as the workers get off work, which is a very worthy method to consider. Because workers can only borrow or read books after work, the library closes at this time, which does not help the workers much. Because of too many seats, one cinema is now in danger of collapsing. There are obviously too few plays suitable for workers' tastes. In the Tiexi District, next to the workers' Ping Opera Theater are several storytelling venues filled with smoke and people, Da Ba Yi and Xiao Wu Yi have become people's spiritual food that is better than nothing. Comrades on the cultural front should actively support the people who are building Angang. There is a rather beautiful theater in Anshan City, which recently invited the Shijiazhuang Peking Opera Troupe to perform. Some workers like Peking Opera, but the workers' cultural life cannot be satisfied by this alone. Their hands are extended to the whole country.

    The new situation has created new problems. That is, municipal construction cannot keep up with the needs of industrial and capital construction development. Carrying out municipal construction according to the requirements of Angang construction, this problem is very urgent. We should provide the workers and staff who have worked all day with convenient living conditions. From a long-term perspective, we should build the city better, so that people can work better, and also expand their spiritual domain and receive various benefits. For this reason, we must start construction from now on. Measures such as traffic facilities in the city streets, road repairs, installation of street lights, sewers, gas, water and electricity, shops, schools, entertainment venues, and cultural institutions need to be specified in a unified plan and constructed in order of priority and urgency.

    市政建设同生产建设必须统一配合
    ——鞍山通讯
    安岗
    火车开到离鞍钢十多里的立山站，遥望鞍山钢铁厂地区，火光烧红了半边天，也烧热了车上每个人的心。满车的人，包括那些久居在鞍山的人们在内，都站起来贪婪地凝视着。人们深深为新中国人民力量的增涨，为这个在五年之后将比现在生产量提高数倍的现代化的新鞍钢而欢呼。
    ×××
    鞍山市是一个工人集中的城市。在三十八万人口的城市中，生产的和基本建设的职工近十五万人，其余人口大部分是工人的家属。在宽阔的柏油路的市街上，到处放送着工人们爱听的歌曲，广播着工人们生产与提前完工的捷报。下了班的工人们涌进市区，奔向百货公司、书店、剧院、电影院和夜市……。
    鞍山市的工人阶级在中国共产党领导下，以忘我的劳动创造着伟大祖国社会财富的同时，也提高了自己的生活水平。基本建设的熟练工人，一般的是一日工资平均可得十七分左右。一个瓦工创造了快速的工作法，曾经几十倍地提高了定额，按件计值一个月共得工资三千分。他的成绩，很快地就成为大家学习的榜样。你和任何一个普通工人谈话，首先感觉到的是他对共产党对毛主席从内心自然流露的阶级热爱。在解放初期，鞍山市工人阶级刚刚结束了受人压迫的、一月只能领少量混合面的苦难日子，他们那时是多么香甜地吃着粗粮啊！可是现在细粮成了主要食品了。曾经有一个很短的时期，市场上粗粮上市较多，工人们便提出了意见：“要大量供应面粉，现在人们吃细粮吃惯了。”过去工人对日用品的要求是“能够用就好”，现在则是要求
    “美观，质量好”。前两年，市场上的手表是六七十万元的最受工人欢迎，现在这样的手表从热货变成了冷货。现在最好卖的是价钱较高质量较好的手表了。那种形状拙劣毫无色彩的皮鞋已经不能畅销了。四川、汉口等地一些皮鞋贩卖商们摸住了工人们的心理，从远道给工人寄来广告和样本，先寄上样式美观的皮鞋，然后才要你付款。过去工人做单衣或棉衣用的是布。现在鞍山市百货公司有十几个门面出售着不同颜色、不同种类的衣料，可是还供不应求。过去的工人那有心思想到吃糖果，现在在这比北京百货公司糖果食品门市部要大五六倍的地方成天拥挤着人。糖果店的营业额现在比七月份大了三倍，可是还不能满足市场上的需要，国营经济部门正在准备增加糖果制造厂来满足工人的要求。
    新的情况向贸易工作者提出了新的要求。这就是必须设法主动地供给人民的需要，不要落在人民提高了的要求后边。像今年中秋节，经济机关从外边订购了二十万斤月饼来供应市场，还担心大家的肚皮会不会装得下？一卖才知道原来是订少了。有些日用品因为落后于工人的要求而不能顺利地销出。
    鞍山市百货公司和合作社担负了全市占百分之八十以上的零售额，工人们主要的生活需要都依靠着国家经济部门来解决，这是鞍山市经济工作者支援鞍钢建设的光荣任务。这就需要很好地深入到工人生活中去了解他们的需要。譬如天冷了，工人需要大量的棉花和皮帽，需要铝制饭盒，需要棉鞋毛鞋，可是，今年因为事前估计不足，以致一度造成部分急用品缺货现象。在这个工人的城市里，贸易工作的方式必须适合工人的需要。职工们上班和下班的时间是一致的，因此，他们购买东西常常带有很大的集中性和突击性，大家在同一个时间购买性质相同的物资，可是我们的门市部门面太少，商品种类太少，售货员太少，手续太繁，这样便有不少的人等来等去等到了上班时间，只好空手而去。
    因为大规模进行基本建设，鞍山市人口从一九四九年的十九万突增至今年的三十八万，这就给市政建设工作提出了新的问题。
    房荒是严重的。一间小房子常常要住上两三家人家，旅馆是挤得满满的，许多房子抹上浆就有人搬进去。但是鞍山的职工们并没有被这个困难吓倒，一位大学生说：“正因为房荒，我们才来建设。”交通工具是不够的，公共汽车少，班次少，很多人无车可坐，有的来回上班要步行二十里。今年已修了四十多里的供工人用的铁道，明年还要修五十里。但这仍不能赶上客观的需要。鞍山的事实证明，交通建设必须有计划地配合大规模开展的基本建设，这不但要供应工人足够用的车辆，而且还要很好地安排交通秩序，每天下班时，职工们自用的两万多辆自行车，来往不断的火车、大卡车、小汽车和密集的人群交错在一起，交通指挥是一个十分严重的问题。据统计，从本年一月至十一月十五日，共发生各种交通事故三百七十件，人民生命财产受到不少的损失。现在鞍山市正在热烈地开展
    “交通安全月”，在工人集中出入的地区都设立了交通警察，市政机关对汽车司机也进行了教育并订出奖惩办法，每天晚间工人下班时，就有人提着纸灯笼（因为马路缺乏照明设备）站在马路中心指挥交通。交通事故已在减少。
    许多看起来像是很小的问题，当它成为群众性的问题时，便表现了迫切的严重的性质。这里经常发生排队现象，照像排队，理发排队，看电影排队，作衣服排队………这是可喜的现象，说明我们祖国的建设事业正在蓬勃发展着，同时也告诉我们：必须加快各方面工作的速度来配合鞍钢的建设工作。
    职工们迫切要求文化娱乐。基本建设的工人是三班制，除了工作和睡眠时间外，他们要求合理而正当地支配休息时间。全国各地来到鞍钢工作和学习的人日益增加，城市应有活跃的文化生活来满足大家的要求并提高他们。书店里人挤得满满的，穿着工作服的工人们下工后来不及换下衣裳，就跑到中国图书发行公司看“焊接方法”、“土木建筑规程”等类的书籍。新华书店的柜台上摆着的一本东北工业出版社出版的“建筑工程技术定额原理”，被人爱不释手地阅读着，这本新书现在已经成了旧书。书店里书的种类太少，不能满足人们的需要。这里书报相当缺乏，鞍钢工人迫切要求书店组织一些流动售书小组，到这里开展零售业务。怎样更好地运用现有的书籍，使它发挥最大的效果，也是一个大问题。例如，鞍钢的图书馆是和工人一起下班的，这种作法很值得考虑。因为工人只有在下班后才能去借书或看书，图书馆在这时候下了班，对工人的帮助就不大了。电影院因为上座过多，现在有一家已有倒坍的危险。适合工人口味的戏显然太少，在铁西区，跟工人评剧院并列的是几个烟气薰天坐满了人的说书场，大八义、小五义成了人们聊胜于无的精神食粮。文化战线的同志们应当主动地支援建设鞍钢的人们。鞍山市有一座相当漂亮的剧场，最近才请到石家庄的京剧团演出。工人们有些人是喜爱京剧的，然而工人们的文化生活却不能以此为满足，他们的手是伸向全国的。
    新情况产生了新问题。这就是市政建设跟不上工业和基本建设发展的需要。根据鞍钢建设的要求进行市政建设，这个问题是十分迫切的。我们应当让劳动了一天的工人们职员们有着生活上的便利条件。从长远的光景设想，我们应当把城市建设得更好一些，使人们能够更好的工作，也能够扩展精神领域，接受各种教益。为了这，我们就必须从现在起进行建设，像市街的交通设施、修马路、安装路灯、上下水道、瓦斯、水电、商店、学校、娱乐场所、文化机关等等措施，都需要规定在一个统一的计划中，来着手按其轻重缓急进行建设。更正十二月十一日本报第二版所载“中央农业部通知各地加强农药使用管理”一稿中，“一○六五”农药应为“一六○五”农药。
