Heilongjiang Province's senior cadres have made achievements since beginning systematic theoretical learning in 1950.

The province's senior study group mainly consists of cadres at or above the level of section chief in the province and municipalities, as well as county party secretaries, county heads, and individual county committee members of equivalent standing, totaling approximately one thousand people. From 1950 until the start of the "Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries" movement in 1951, they studied "Political Economy," the first three chapters of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," and "On Practice." In May 1952, all units successively began studying "On Contradiction," which concluded at the end of September. In mid-October, they began studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At the beginning of December, they began studying Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R." Upon completion, they will transition to studying issues related to socialist economic construction.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has consistently attached great importance to the learning of senior cadres. Leading comrades in various units have also largely conscientiously participated in and led the learning. During the study of "On Contradiction," Comrade Zhao Dezun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally led the discussion among the province and city's main responsible cadres and answered their questions. Comrade Yang Yingjie, former Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, also frequently explained some of the classic works of Marxism-Leninism to cadres at the level of department and bureau chiefs in the provincial government. Comrade Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, has consistently strived to learn. From 1949 to the present, in addition to studying during the prescribed times, he also studies for an hour during his rest time. He has completed twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" books and the entire "Das Kapital." He also closely oversees the study of the Provincial Government Party Group, often personally convening study and discussion meetings attended by the heads of various departments; he first makes enlightening remarks at the meeting and then concludes with a summary. He also frequently conducts commendations and criticisms at study meetings, questioning the reasons for those who do not attend discussion meetings. Comrade Li Jianbai, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, frequently lectures and answers questions; Comrade Zheng Xuekong of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee also treats leading learning as an important task. Other units, such as the Secretary of the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee and the Secretary of the Railway Party Committee, also personally lead the learning. When writing papers, the responsible comrades generally submit their papers first. Papers by Comrades Zhao Dezun, Li Jianbai, and others have been published in the Northeast Daily.

In organizing the theoretical learning of senior cadres, the province has adopted the following measures: (1) Supervising and inspecting, and adhering to the system. For example, the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee stipulates that everyone should adhere to two hours of study together every morning for collective reading and discussion every afternoon of the week. With such a system, everyone gradually developed the habit of learning. Therefore, even during the busiest time of party consolidation in July and August of this year, they persisted in learning. In terms of supervision and inspection, the Provincial Party Committee mainly focused on the regularly held discussion meetings. Before the discussion, it took the initiative to urge the heads of various units and group leaders to stipulate the content of the discussion; during the discussion, the Provincial Party Committee also sent people with emphasis to participate, collect questions, grasp the situation, and study experience to guide other units, and at the same time, it also urged other units. (2) Grasping key points, grasping typical examples, grasping activists, and grasping backbones. The Provincial Party Committee selected the Party Group of the Provincial Government as the key point, from which to draw experience and promote the learning of other units. For individual learning of senior cadres, the Provincial Party Committee selected comrades with prestige and self-study habits who could also set an example, cultivated typical examples, and took the initiative to help them formulate individual or group study plans, and notified and disseminated these plans to urge and enlighten other comrades. In addition, in the study groups of various units, the leading comrades also grasped activists and backbones. Among the department and bureau-level cadres of the Provincial Government, there were eight or nine comrades who were activists. With these backbones, the issues can be discussed more concentratedly and profoundly in the discussion, which also affects others to actively read books and prepare opinions. (3) Issuing circulars and commending, introducing learning situations, exchanging experience, and writing reading reports and learning papers on schedule. During the study of "On Contradiction," the Provincial Party Committee issued more than ten circulars. These circulars not only commended good units and individuals but also introduced the learning situation of various units, which played a role in urging learning and exchanging experience. When the study came to an end, the Provincial Party Committee also urged everyone to write learning papers to check the learning effect.

Based on the above reasons, the learning of the province's senior study group has achieved significant gains. First, the understanding of the basic issues of the Chinese revolution, the domestic and international situation, and the understanding and implementation of the Party's various policies and guidelines have generally improved. For example, in the study of "On Contradiction," there was a further understanding of issues such as the existence of two basic contradictions in China, how to treat and resolve these two contradictions and their interconnections, the contradiction between the two roads in the countryside, and the particularity of the contradiction between the Chinese proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Many comrades' theoretical errors (such as the theory of external causes, subjectivism in ideological methods, narrow empiricism, and dogmatism of rigidly applying formulas without conducting specific analysis) have also been corrected. In studying Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there was a new understanding of the current international situation. Many comrades reviewed their past thinking that if a war were to break out, it would mainly be between the two camps, while neglecting the essence of the contradictions between imperialism. Second, theory is linked to practice, and theory is used to guide practice. In the study of "On Contradiction," all departments found the main contradictions in their own work. The Party Group of the Provincial Government used four discussion sessions to successively study the main contradictions in the current work of each department. Many factory party secretaries and directors used the viewpoint of "On Contradiction" to review the work of their departments, find the main contradictions, and find ways to solve the main contradictions. Third, the importance of understanding the situation, conducting investigations and research, and using specific analysis methods to handle work was recognized, erroneous ideological methods and bureaucratic work styles were reviewed, leadership methods were transformed, and correct work styles were established. For example, when Comrade Liu Zhenyao led the party consolidation and building in the province and cities, he conducted a thorough and detailed investigation and specific analysis of the ideological situation of the cadres, thus grasping the main problems, and the problems were solved in a concentrated and profound way. Comrade Zhang Yuru of the Party School, in his paper, reviewed that the Party School in the past mostly started from general abstract articles in conducting education, lacked specific analysis of specific situations, and the systematic investigation and research on the differences of each term of objects and the existing different ideological problems was insufficient. Therefore, in teaching work, it could not achieve very good symptomatic treatment. Comrade Liang Zhichao of the Department of Culture and Education said in his paper: Because he had not studied "On Contradiction" in the past, he often started from subjective imagination, one-sided experience, and the articles and formulas of document instructions when dealing with work and solving problems. He could not go deep into reality to investigate and research, so there was bureaucracy in his work; he was not good at discovering problems and solving problems, so the work was generalized and could not advance. In the future, he must systematically and carefully study problems and truly solve problems. Fourth, the understanding of theoretical learning was improved, the atmosphere of learning increased, the learning of lower-level cadres was influenced and helped, and the political work of various departments was strengthened. After more than two years of study, the past view that theoretical learning was opposed to work no longer existed. During the study of "On Contradiction," everyone often discussed how to grasp the main contradictions and how to solve the main contradictions, and where to find theoretical basis to prove their opinions. Comrade Zhang Haiqing of the Provincial Government was in poor health. Although the organization approved that he should not participate in the study, he still insisted on studying in the morning and attended the discussion meetings on time. Some comrades have developed self-study habits, get up with ordinary cadres to read books every day, and can squeeze time to study. In addition, because theoretical learning has been carried out, the political work of various departments has also been strengthened.

However, the province also has some shortcomings in organizing the learning of senior cadres. First, the formulated learning plan is not thorough enough, and the situation is not accurately estimated. For example, the study of "On Contradiction" was originally planned to start in May and end at the end of June, but it actually ended at the end of September. Second, in these studies, some of the work that could have been done has not been done. For example, in the study of "On Contradiction," although the Provincial Party Committee provided some reference materials to various units, it did not do enough in terms of content guidance, and it was not comprehensive in its supervision and inspection. It did not do its best to urge the worse units, so some units did not learn well enough, and some comrades did not learn deeply enough.

### 两年多来黑龙江省高级干部理论学习有成绩

    两年多来黑龙江省高级干部理论学习有成绩
    黑龙江省高级干部，从一九五○年开始系统的理论学习以来，已获得成绩。
    该省高级学习组，主要是由省、市处长级以上干部组成，各县县委书记、县长和个别程度相当的县委委员也参加了高级组，共一千人左右。从一九五○年到一九五一年“镇压反革命”运动开始以前，即学习了“政治经济学”、“联共党史简明教程”前三章和“实践论”。一九五二年五月间，各单位均先后开始学习“矛盾论”，至九月末结束。十月中旬开始学习联共党第十九次代表大会的文件。十二月初开始学习斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。学完后即将转入关于社会主义经济建设问题的学习。
    对于高级干部的学习，中共黑龙江省委会一贯非常重视。各单位的领导同志也大都认真参加学习和领导学习。在“矛盾论”的学习中，省委书记赵德尊同志亲自领导省市主要负责干部进行讨论，并给他们解答问题。前省委副书记杨英杰同志，也经常给省府厅长级干部讲解一些马克思列宁主义的经典著作。省府主席于毅夫同志一向努力学习，从一九四九年到现在，除按规定时间学习外，还在休息时间学习一小时。他已学完十二本“干部必读”和全部“资本论”。他并且对省府党组学习抓得很紧，常常亲自召集各厅长出席学习讨论会；在会上先作启发性的发言，最后并作总结。他还经常在学习会上进行表扬和批评，对不出席讨论会者追问原因。省委宣传部部长李剑白同志，经常讲课和解答问题；省委组织部郑学孔同志，也把领导学习作为一项重要工作来进行。其他单位，如齐齐哈尔市市委书记、铁路党委书记等也都亲自领导学习。在写论文时一般都是负责同志先交卷。赵德尊、李剑白等同志的论文都在东北日报上发表过。
    在组织高级干部的理论学习中，该省采取了如下一些办法：（一）督促检查，坚持制度。如省委组织部规定每天早晨坚持两小时学习，大家在一起集体阅读；每星期下午坚持讨论。有了这样的制度，就使大家逐渐养成了学习习惯。因此，在今年七、八月间正是整党工作最忙的时候，他们也坚持了学习。在督促检查方面，省委主要是抓紧定期举行的讨论会。在讨论之前，主动督促各单位首长、小组长，规定讨论内容；在讨论时，省委又有重点地派人去参加，搜集问题、掌握情况、研究经验，以指导其他单位，同时也督促了其他单位。（二）抓重点、抓典型、抓积极分子、抓骨干。省委选了省府党组为重点，从中吸取经验，推动其他单位的学习。对于高级干部个人学习，省委选择了有威信并有自学习惯又能以身作则的同志，培养典型，主动帮助他们制定个人或小组学习计划，通报传播这些计划，来督促和启发其他同志。此外，在各单位学习小组里，领导同志还抓积极分子、抓骨干。在省府厅长级干部中，就有八、九名同志是积极分子。有了这些骨干，在讨论中就能把问题谈得更集中更深刻，也就影响了别人积极看书和准备意见。（三）通报表扬，介绍学习情况，交流经验，按期写读书报告与学习论文。在“矛盾论”的学习中，省委曾发过十余次通报，这些通报不仅是表扬好的单位、个人，同时又介绍各单位学习情况，起了督促学习交流经验的作用。当学习告一段落时，省委还督促大家写学习论文，以检查学习效果。
    基于上述原因，该省高级学习组的学习，是有显著的收获的。首先，对中国革命的基本问题、国内外形势的认识，对于党的各种方针政策的认识和执行，一般都有了提高。比如在“矛盾论”的学习中，对中国存在着两种基本矛盾、如何对待和解决这两种矛盾及其互相联系，农村两条道路的矛盾，中国无产阶级与资产阶级矛盾的特殊性等问题，一般都有了进一步的认识。很多同志在理论上的错误观点（如外因论、思想方法上的主观主义、狭隘的经验主义及不进行具体分析硬套公式的教条主义等），也得到了纠正。在学习马林科夫在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告中，对当前国际形势有了新的认识。很多同志都检讨了自己过去总认为如果战争要爆发，主要是在两个阵营之间，而忽视了帝国主义之间矛盾的本质等思想。其次，理论联系实际，并运用理论指导了实践。在“矛盾论”的学习中，各部门都找到了本单位工作中的主要矛盾。省府党组用四次讨论会的时间，依次的研究了各厅当前工作的主要矛盾。很多工厂党委书记和厂长，都用“矛盾论”的观点，联系检查了自己部门的工作，找出了主要矛盾和解决主要矛盾的办法。第三，认识到了解情况、调查研究、用具体分析的方法处理工作的重要，检查了错误的思想方法和官僚主义作风，转变了领导方法，树立了正确的作风。如刘振尧同志在领导省市整党建党时，对干部的思想情况进行了周密细致的调查和具体分析，因而抓住了主要问题，问题就解决得集中深刻。党校张玉瑞同志，在论文中检讨了党校过去在进行教育中多从一般抽象的条文出发，缺乏对于具体情况的具体分析，对于每期对象的不同及存在的不同思想问题，系统的调查研究不够，因而在教学工作中，就不能作到很好的对症下药。文教厅梁志超同志在论文中说：由于过去没学习矛盾论，因而处理工作，解决问题，往往从主观想象、片面经验和文件指示的条文公式出发，不能深入实际，调查研究，所以工作上有官僚主义；不善于发现问题解决问题，以致工作一般化，不能前进。今后必须系统周密的研究问题，真正解决问题。第四，提高了对理论学习的认识，学习空气增长了，影响和帮助了下级干部的学习，加强了各部门的政治工作。经过了二年多的学习，过去那种认为理论学习是与工作对立的观点已经不存在了。在
    “矛盾论”学习中间，大家经常议论的是如何抓主要矛盾，如何解决主要矛盾，从那里找理论根据来证实自己的意见。省府张骇青同志身体不好，虽然组织批准不参加学习，但是他自己早晨仍然坚持学习，并按时出席讨论会。一部分同志已经养成了自学习惯，每天和一般干部一同起床看书，并能挤时间学习。另外，由于理论学习开展起来，对各部门的政治工作也加强了。
    但是，该省在组织高级干部学习中，也还有一些缺点。首先是制定的学习计划不够周密，情况估计不够准确。比如“矛盾论”的学习，原计划五月开始到六月末结束，但实际上到九月末才结束。其次是在这些学习中，有些能够作的工作还没有作到。比如在“矛盾论”的学习中，省委虽供给了各单位一些参考材料，但在内容指导上作的很不够，在督促检查上还不全面，对较差的单位没有尽到全力督促的责任；所以有些单位学得还不够好，有些同志学得也不够深入。
