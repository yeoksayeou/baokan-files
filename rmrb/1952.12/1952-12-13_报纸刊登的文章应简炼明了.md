    Articles Published in Newspapers Should Be Concise and Clear
    Comrade Editor: To enhance the effect of propaganda, articles in newspapers must be written concisely and clearly. The requirement for concise and clear writing is not based on length. Some long articles, such as the "Investigation Report on the Exchange of Urban and Rural Products Conference in Danyang County, Southern Jiangsu District" broadcast by Xinhua News Agency on August 6th, although as long as three or four thousand words, are neither verbose nor disorganized, and readers like to read them. However, some long articles published in newspapers appear to be very unconsolidated because the content is repetitive. For example, the article "The Great Achievements and Experiences of the Nanchang City Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference" published in the Jiangxi Daily on August 9th, its main contents are: the harvest of the conference, main experiences, and several opinions. This could have been explained with three or four thousand words, but the author wrote nearly seven thousand words in a rambling manner. Why was it written so long? The main reason is that the author did not organize the material well, refine the language, and the editor did not provide the necessary deletions and revisions. For example, the third and fourth sections of the first part of the article both say that private industrialists and merchants have increased their confidence in management, but they are not integrated together; some of the materials are repeated with the first section of the second part. Some problems can be explained with very few words, but many words are used instead. Such articles are difficult to attract the interest of readers, thus reducing the propaganda effect of the newspaper. Some comrades said:
    "Long and tedious articles are difficult to understand; after reading the end, you forget the beginning." I hope that all newspapers will pay attention to this issue. Wu Shuqi

### 报纸刊登的文章应简炼明了

    报纸刊登的文章应简炼明了
    编辑同志：为增强宣传效果，报纸上的文章，必须写得简炼、明了。要求文字简炼明了，并不是以长短为标准。有些长文章如八月六日新华社播发的“苏南区丹阳县城乡物产交流大会调查报告”，虽然长至三、四千字，但既不噜囌，条理又极分明，读者喜欢看。可是有些报纸刊登的长文章，因为内容重复，就显得很不简炼。例如八月九日江西日报刊登的“南昌市城乡物资交流大会的伟大成就和经验”一文，其主要内容是：大会收获、主要经验、几点意见。这本来用三、四千字就可以说明的，可是作者拉杂地写了近七千字。为什么写的这样长呢？主要是作者没有很好的组织材料，精炼语言，而编者也没有给予必要的删改。例如该文第一部分的第三、四两节，同是说私营工商业提高了经营的信心，却没有综合在一起；其中有些材料并和第二部分中的第一节重复。有的问题，只用很少的话就可以说明的，却说了很多话。这样的文章，很难吸引读者的兴趣，因而减低了报纸的宣传效果。有些同志说：
    “长篇大论看不懂，看了后面，忘了前面。”我希望各报注意这个问题。  吴述綮
