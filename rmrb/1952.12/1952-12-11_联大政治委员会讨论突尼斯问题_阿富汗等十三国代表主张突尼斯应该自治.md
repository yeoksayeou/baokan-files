Xinhua News Agency Report: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the Tunisian question on the 5th, and continued its discussions on the 6th and 8th. This issue was placed on the agenda of the current General Assembly at the insistence of thirteen Asian and Arab countries, overcoming the stubborn opposition of representatives from colonial powers (primarily the United States, Britain, and France). Representatives from the United States, Britain, and France had repeatedly attempted to prevent UN bodies from discussing this issue.

The French representative even refused to attend the Political Committee meetings.

The Tunisian question arose because French colonialists were attempting to maintain their power in this colony, refusing the Tunisian people's desire for independence. On this issue, French colonialists have consistently received support from American imperialists, who are currently constructing naval and air bases in Tunisia and, together with the French colonialists, are plundering the Tunisian people.

In a statement regarding the inclusion of the Tunisian question on the agenda of the current United Nations General Assembly, the thirteen Asian and Arab countries urged UN member states to pay attention to the turbulent situation in Tunisia.

Subsequently, Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrulla Khan spoke, detailing the conflict between Tunisia and France, and citing numerous documents to prove that the Tunisian people's demand for national independence was well-founded and just. He said: This issue is not new to the United Nations. In April, colonial countries blocked the inclusion of the Tunisian question on the Security Council's agenda. Zafrulla Khan urged the committee to note the fact that the Tunisian people's national liberation movement is continuing to expand, despite the French authorities' brutal suppression of participants in the movement. Zafrulla Khan pointed out that it is now the second half of the twentieth century, and after two world wars, colonial rule has been shaken.

It must be pointed out that while Zafrulla Khan criticized the French government for carrying out colonialist plunder in Tunisia, he did not mention the fact that the United States is involved in this plunder and is trying to seize Tunisia.

Zafrulla Khan proved that the United Nations not only can, but must discuss the Tunisian question and take effective measures to enable Tunisia to achieve autonomy. Zafrulla Khan finally proposed a proposal on the Tunisian question. This proposal was jointly put forward by Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen. The proposal recommends that the French government "establish a normal situation in Tunisia and establish normal people's freedoms," and recommends that representatives of France and the legitimate representatives of the Tunisian people hold talks to discuss allowing Tunisia to achieve autonomy. The proposal calls for the establishment of a "mediation committee" to be responsible for preparing and facilitating negotiations between Tunisia and French representatives. The proposal also calls for the inclusion of the Tunisian question on the agenda of the next United Nations General Assembly.

At the meeting held on the 6th, British representative Lloyd said that UN intervention in the Tunisian question would only cause unrest and friction in Tunisia, and would not reduce these frictions. Obviously, when the British representative spoke of unrest and friction, he had in mind the Tunisian people's movement for independence.

Egyptian representative Mustafa's speech occupied most of the meeting. He detailed the history of the issue under discussion, and emphasized that the Tunisian people have long expressed their desire to break away from the French colonialists and become independent. The Egyptian representative read out many official documents and cited several statistics to prove the French authorities' policy of plundering Tunisia's natural resources and cruelly exploiting the Tunisian people. Mustafa concluded by saying that the Egyptian delegation firmly believes that the Tunisian question must be resolved fairly in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

The Indonesian representative urged the committee to pay attention to news reports about the assassination of Tunisian trade union leader Achade in Tunisia. He said that this incident further proves that the United Nations' discussion of the Tunisian question is an urgent necessity.

Iranian representative Andijan spoke near the end of the meeting. He proved that the colonial countries' representatives' claim that the Political Committee has no right to discuss the Tunisian question is untenable.

The process of the Tunisian question debate in the Political Committee shows that the colonial countries' representatives' attempt to prevent the United Nations from discussing this issue has not succeeded. Therefore, the United States played a trick, conspiring to prevent the Tunisian question debate from reaching a result. This is the proposal put forward by the Brazilian representative on behalf of some Latin American countries at the meeting on the 8th, which merely expresses in empty words the hope of "resolving" differences with each other. If the General Assembly adopts such a proposal, it would in effect mean agreeing to the French authorities' colonial plunder in Tunisia, and agreeing to the French authorities' continued use of terror to oppress the Tunisian people who are fighting for their independence.

The next speaker was U.S. representative Jessup, who immediately supported the Brazilian proposal. This shows that the real proposer of this proposal is the U.S. State Department.

At the meeting, no representative of any Arab country expressed an opinion on the Brazilian proposal.

### 联大政治委员会讨论突尼斯问题  阿富汗等十三国代表主张突尼斯应该自治

    联大政治委员会讨论突尼斯问题
    阿富汗等十三国代表主张突尼斯应该自治
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会于五日开始讨论突尼斯问题，并于六日、八日继续讨论。这个问题是在十三个亚洲和阿拉伯国家的坚持下，排除了殖民国家（首先是美、英、法三国）代表的顽固反对，而列入本届大会议程的，美、英、法三国代表曾经屡次试图阻止联合国机构讨论这个问题。
    法国代表竟拒绝参加政治委员会会议。
    突尼斯问题之所以发生，是由于法国殖民者企图在这个殖民地保持他们的势力，拒绝突尼斯人民希望独立的要求。法国殖民者在这个问题上一贯受到美帝国主义者的支持，美帝国主义者目前正在突尼斯境内构筑海军和空军基地，并和法国殖民者一起掠夺突尼斯人民。
    十三个亚洲和阿拉伯国家在关于将突尼斯问题列入本届联合国大会议程的声明中，要求联合国各会员国注意突尼斯的不安局势。
    接着，巴基斯坦外交部长查弗鲁拉汗发言，他详细叙述了突尼斯与法国之间发生冲突的情形，并举出许多文件证明突尼斯人民要求民族独立是理由充分的、正义的。他说：这个问题对于联合国说来不是一个新问题。在四月里，殖民国家曾阻挠将突尼斯问题列入安全理事会议程。查弗鲁拉汗促请委员会注意这个事实，就是：突尼斯人民的民族解放运动仍在继续扩大，尽管法国当局对运动参加者实行了残酷的镇压。查弗鲁拉汗指出：现在已是二十世纪的后半期，经过了两次世界大战，殖民统治已经动摇了。
    必须指出：查弗鲁拉汗虽然指责法国政府在突尼斯进行殖民主义的掠夺，却没有提到美国参与这种掠夺并力图夺取突尼斯这个事实。
    查弗鲁拉汗证明联合国不仅能够，而且必须讨论突尼斯问题，并采取有效措施，使突尼斯获得自治。查弗鲁拉汗最后提出了一项关于突尼斯问题的提案。这个提案是由阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、印度、印尼、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和也门十三国联名提出的。提案中建议法国政府“在突尼斯建立正常情况，并建立正常的人民自由”，并建议由法国代表和突尼斯人民的合法代表进行会谈，讨论允许突尼斯自治问题。这个提案主张成立“斡旋委员会”来负责筹备并促成突尼斯与法国代表之间的谈判。提案并主张将突尼斯问题列入下一届联合国大会的议程。
    在六日举行的会议上，英国代表劳埃德说，联合国干涉突尼斯问题只会在突尼斯引起不安和摩擦，而不会减弱这些摩擦。很显然的，英国代表说到不安和摩擦时，他心目中想到的是突尼斯人民要求独立的运动。
    埃及代表慕斯塔法的发言占据了这次会议的大部分时间。他详细地叙述了正在讨论的问题的历史，并着重指出：突尼斯人民很久以来便表示他们要脱离法国殖民者而独立的愿望。这位埃及代表宣读了许多官方文件，并引证了若干统计数字，证明法国当局所实行的掠夺突尼斯天然富源和残酷剥削突尼斯人民的政策。慕斯塔法最后说，埃及代表团坚决主张突尼斯问题必须根据联合国宪章的原则公平解决。
    印度尼西亚代表促请委员会注意报纸刊载的关于突尼斯工会领袖阿歇德在突尼斯被暗杀的消息。他说，这件事情更加证明了联合国讨论突尼斯问题是一件迫切的必要之举。
    伊朗代表安迪让在会议快终了时发言。他证明殖民国家代表们说政治委员会无权讨论突尼斯问题的说法是站不住脚的。
    政治委员会上突尼斯问题辩论的过程说明殖民国家代表阻挠联合国讨论这个问题的企图没有成功。因此，美国就玩弄了一个花样，阴谋使突尼斯问题辩论得不出一个结果来。这就是巴西代表在八日会议上代表一些拉丁美洲国家所提出的提案，这个提案仅仅以空洞的词句表示希望“解决”彼此之间的分歧。大会如果通过这样一个提案，实际上就意味着同意法国当局在突尼斯的殖民掠夺，同意法国当局继续使用恐怖手段，压迫为他们的独立而斗争的突尼斯人民。
    继起发言的是美国代表耶塞普，他立即支持巴西提案。这就说明了这个提案的真正提案人是美国国务院。
    在会议上，任何阿拉伯国家的代表都没有对巴西提案发表意见。
