Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 4th — Van Fleet's offensive in the Kimhwa area has completely failed. During the last five days of November, there were only short skirmishes on the left side of the Shangganling mountain. On the 26th and 28th, our troops guarding this mountain top braved the sub-zero weather and counterattacked the enemy entrenched on two small hilltops east of the mountain top, eliminating a total of more than 220 enemy soldiers. In the past two days, the enemy on these two small positions have been hiding in their fortifications, fearing both our artillery fire and our sudden attacks. Sometimes the enemy tries to retaliate against our army, but as soon as our army launches a counterattack, they hurriedly run back.

In other areas of the front, the enemy conducted artillery battles and launched several attacks in five days, but all were defeated by our army. On the 28th, our army guarding the Yugang area northwest of Lianchuan repelled an attack by two companies of the enemy, eliminating more than 90 enemy soldiers. On the same day, in the Zuo Shou Dong area southeast of Kim Sung, our army repelled an attack by a reinforced company of the enemy, eliminating more than 80 enemy soldiers. At that time, the enemy retreated in panic, leaving behind more than 40 corpses. Near Shangmugok and Xingting northwest of Kimhwa, our army wiped out an entire reinforced platoon and a squad of the enemy, totaling more than 80 enemy soldiers.

In these five days, our front-line artillery killed or wounded more than 600 enemy soldiers, and our front-line anti-aircraft artillery shot down six enemy planes and damaged twelve enemy planes.
    
Xinhua News Agency, 3rd — Officers of the invading American army admit that they cannot deal with the ingenious tunnel fortifications built by the Korean and Chinese People's armies. According to a United Press report from the Korean Central Front on November 30th: "American officers say that the Chinese army has dug 'actual underground cities' under the mountain positions in Korea." An American officer who tasted the tunnel warfare of the Korean and Chinese People's armies at Bai Ma Shan and Triangle Hill said: "They actually hollowed out the inside of the mountain and live inside. Our air force and artillery cannot work."

The news also said: "The Communist army also dug caves to cleverly conceal their artillery positions," and "mortar positions are also hidden in bunkers." "The enemy's fortifications crisscross most parts of the mountain, and there are many tunnels and passages connecting many hillsides, so that supplies and reinforcements can be transported without worrying about the bombardment of the Allied forces."

    朝中部队继续在上甘岭等地杀伤敌军
    范佛里特在金化地区的攻势彻底破产
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】范佛里特在金化地区的攻势已经彻底破产了。在十一月份的最后五天中，上甘岭左边山岭上只有短时间的小战斗。二十六日和二十八日，守卫在这个山顶上的我军冒着零下的寒冷天气，先后向盘踞在山顶东面两个小山头上的敌人进行反击，共计歼灭敌人二百二十多名。最近两天中，在这两个小阵地上的敌人都躲藏在工事里，既怕我军炮火的轰击，又怕我军突然而来的袭击。有时敌人想出来报复我军一下，但是当我军一发起反击，他们又急急忙忙地跑回去了。
    在前线其他地区，敌军在五天中进行炮战和发动了几次进攻，结果都被我军击败。二十八日，守卫在涟川西北榆岗地区的我军击退敌人两个连的进攻，歼灭敌人九十多名。同日，在金城东南座首洞地区，我军击退敌人一个加强连的进攻，歼敌八十多名。当时敌人慌乱撤退，丢下尸首四十多具。在金化西北上墨谷和杏亭附近，我军歼敌一个加强排和一个班全部，共计八十多名。
    在这五天中，我军前线炮火击毙击伤敌军六百多名，我军前线高射火器击落敌机六架，击伤敌机十二架。
    【新华社三日讯】侵朝美军军官承认无法对付朝中人民军队构筑的巧妙的坑道工事。据合众社朝鲜中线十一月三十日电透露：“美国军官说，中国军队已在朝鲜山头阵地之下挖掘了‘实际的地下城市’。”一个曾在白马山和三角山尝到朝中人民军队坑道战滋味的美国军官说：“他们实际上是把山头内部挖空住在里面，我们的空军和大炮是无法发生作用的。”
    该消息又说：“共军并挖掘洞穴把他们的大炮阵地巧妙地隐蔽起来”，“迫击炮阵地也隐蔽在地堡中”。“敌军的防御工事在山中大部分地方纵横交错着，并有许多地道和通道把许多山坡连接起来，以便可以运输供应品和援军，而无须顾虑联军的轰击”。
