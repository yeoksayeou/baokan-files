    (I)
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, and with the help of Soviet experts, the total output value of industrial construction in Northeast China by the end of 1952 is expected to exceed the highest historical level (1943) by 10% after several years of arduous struggle by the entire working class. The proportion of industry in the entire national economy will increase to 55.9%. This year, investment in industrial capital construction, including new construction and renovation, has accounted for 70.4%. These facts indicate that the industrial construction of Northeast China has basically completed the tasks of recovery and transformation, and has begun to move towards a new period of large-scale economic construction. Basic construction has been raised to the primary position in the entire economic construction. Doing a good job in basic construction is of decisive significance to the country's industrialization and is a matter of vital importance to the country's long-term plans. This conference of advanced producers in basic construction is of great significance for summarizing the experience of basic construction, rewarding advanced producers in various fields, and improving the future basic construction work.
    In the past year, the new construction and renovation work of basic construction in Northeast China has achieved great results:
    This year, we have started unprecedented, complex, large-scale basic construction projects that are decisive for China's industrialization: the construction of large-scale steel plants, power stations, coal mines, and the most modern flax mills, as well as various other factory buildings, schools, and dormitories. According to statistics at the end of October, the total amount of basic construction work in Northeast China has been completed by 83.7%. As far as the entire region is concerned, bricklaying, concrete, and other projects for building construction have now been basically completed. Currently, machine installation projects are underway. Some major projects are being carried out in winter operations in order to complete the entire workload on schedule.
    With the completion of basic construction tasks, we have formed an army of 300,000 people for basic construction this year, and established 63 engineering companies and four engineering brigades. This team has expanded significantly compared to last year. This team consists of 244,000 construction workers, 9,000 technicians, and 45,000 management cadres and general staff for basic construction. This huge team is the basic force for completing our basic construction tasks this year. Due to the enthusiasm and high creativity of the working class, and with the help of Soviet experts, we have gained some preliminary experience in engineering design, geological exploration, on-site management, political work, and other aspects of basic construction, and a large number of advanced producers have emerged. Those attending the conference today are a portion of these advanced producers.
    This meeting includes comrades who are engaged in various tasks in basic construction. You have carried out selfless labor in basic construction work, created many advanced experiences, and played a leading and promoting role in the entire work, ensuring the engineering quality of basic construction, accelerating the progress of the project, and reducing the cost of the project. I hope you will continue to work hard, create more advanced experience in various aspects, further master advanced technology, and do a better job in basic construction work to accelerate China's industrialization.
    (II)
    In the past year, we have created and promoted some advanced experiences in basic construction, and these advanced experiences have played a certain role.
    For example, the parallel operation method in mine construction, Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling method in geological exploration, pre-installation and component assembly method in mechanical installation, and parallel flow cyclic operation method in construction management. Su Changyou's bricklaying method, Yang Dezhong's plastering method, and Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line operation method are even more well-known. These advanced experiences have greatly accelerated the speed of our industrial construction. For example, according to the old single-line operation construction method of drilling first and then walling, it would take ten years to complete the Xi'an shaft. Now, using the parallel operation method, coal can be produced in five years. In civil engineering, the implementation of parallel flow operation according to the instruction charts has shortened the construction period by an average of one-third. Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling averages 8.34 meters per day, which is three times more efficient than the old drilling method. As of the end of September this year, the Ministry of Industry system had 34 Ma Wenzhi-style drilling teams. Harbin's promotion of the Su Changyou team's double-handed slurry squeezing method averages 1,600 bricks laid per person per day. The Fuxin Power Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel Company's implementation of pre-installation and assembly installation have greatly accelerated the progress of the project.
    Although we have made the above achievements, there are still shortcomings in the creation and promotion of advanced experience. It is manifested in:
    The commendation, awards, and assistance in summarizing and improving advanced experience are not timely and specific enough.
    There is still a laissez-faire phenomenon in the creation and promotion of advanced experience, and the promotion of advanced experience is very uneven. For example, in the Nanhai construction site in Shenyang, the promotion of Su Changyou's bricklaying method only reached 35%, and the promotion of Xie Wanfu's assembly line operation only reached 20%. Secondly, some cadres shout empty slogans about the importance of promoting advanced experience, but they are not familiar with it and have not studied it well. For example, when the Jixi Mining Bureau Basic Construction Company conducted a test on the specific content of Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling among the cadres, only two out of 28 cadres passed, with a total average score of 25. Some cadres do not understand the basic content of advanced experience, and therefore cannot carry out the promotion and improvement work in a concrete and in-depth manner.
    The creation and promotion of advanced experience is more common in civil engineering, and less common in mechanical foundation engineering and mechanical installation. In the future, advanced experience in industrial basic construction should be developed in all aspects, including design, construction, management, political work, and other aspects, and there should be advanced working methods. Only in this way can our basic construction work develop in parallel. Secondly, there has been advanced experience in quantity and progress, and in the future, we also need to create advanced experience in improving quality and practicing thrift.
    (III)
    Basic construction is a long-term plan for our country and the foundation for realizing national industrialization. Therefore, the main tasks placed before all employees are:
    To ensure that every building construction project is solid, durable, and meets design standards, that is, the quality of the project must be guaranteed.
    Each engineering team must hand over the completed building and installation project to the production department on schedule so that production can be carried out quickly, that is, the construction must be fast.
    To minimize the cost of each project, save materials, and reduce and eliminate work stoppages and rework, that is: construction must be economical and save money.
    Good, fast, and economical are the basic requirements of the Party and the government for basic construction. This is also the requirement put forward to all comrades and workers in basic construction. One of the main methods to achieve these three requirements now is to create advanced experience and advanced working methods, and to promote decisive advanced experience and advanced working methods well. Because basic construction has been raised to the primary position, the investment and the number of employees in basic construction are very large, and the basic construction sites are scattered and involve a large amount of manual production. We are also extremely unfamiliar with this aspect of work. Therefore, there is a huge potential that needs to be tapped. Any trick, any mechanical or semi-mechanical tool that replaces manual tools, any rational division of labor and organic combination of labor that replaces decentralized individual labor, will greatly improve labor productivity.
    China's industrial base is weak, not only is the technology backward and the foundation too narrow, but also mainly light industry. Although there is more industry in the Northeast region than elsewhere, and the proportion of heavy industry is also larger, these industries were established under the predatory policies of Japanese imperialism and have a colonial nature. These industries are mainly raw material mining. The machinery manufacturing industry is very weak. Therefore, we must greatly expand our industrial base and use new equipment to transform and build our industry, especially the construction of projects necessary for national industrialization, which is the most fundamental task at present and the key to steadily promoting industrialization. Our basic construction work must undertake the task of building this new heavy industry, defense industry, and machinery industry. This task is arduous, but it must be completed. However, compared with our huge tasks, our current basic construction strength is still very disproportionate, and our basic construction tasks are increasing year by year. Only by rapidly increasing our basic construction strength can we meet the requirements of this task.
    How to rapidly increase our strength? In addition to planning to run various specialized colleges, vocational schools, and various specialized training courses to train various basic construction personnel, we must also transfer personnel from various production departments to enrich the basic construction institutions, especially to strengthen the design, geological, construction, and management institutions, expand the strength of basic construction, and provide basic construction with sufficient technical cadres, management cadres, and fixed workers to meet the needs of large-scale basic construction. We must actively train and improve our existing cadres, technical personnel, and all workers in actual work. For example, the installation project of the Fuxin Power Plant, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the experience of simplifying the types of work and apprenticeships is very good. It not only completed the task, but also trained skilled workers and expanded the strength of basic construction. This experience should be summarized and promoted well.
    At present, especially in this winter, I hope to do the following things well:
    First of all, the construction departments should plan to gradually increase the number of fixed workers, conduct winter training, conduct political and ideological education and technical education, summarize the construction experience of 1952, and exchange advanced experience, so as to improve the ideological awareness and technical level of fixed workers and make them the backbone of next year's basic construction.
    The design and surveying departments should also summarize the design and surveying experience over the past few years, study the existing Soviet design materials and the design materials of the old Chinese enterprises, and go to the site for research when necessary. They should meet the design standards, achieve design standardization, and gradually focus on factory production and specialization. The design and surveying work should be able to complete the tasks in a timely and accurate manner, and overcome the phenomenon that the design lags behind the construction, otherwise it will hinder the timely completion of the entire basic construction task and delay our industrialization time.
    Our leading cadres should summarize the experience of construction management and organizational leadership, learn the complete set of basic construction organization and management work, do a good job in labor organization, fully utilize the existing equipment capacity and technical conditions, gradually expand the degree and scope of mechanization in basic construction, strengthen the responsibility system in construction management and technology, complete the plan on a regular basis on the basis of ensuring quality, and implement the economic accounting system.
    Our political workers and the Party organizations, trade unions, and youth leagues in basic construction should summarize the experience of conducting political work in basic construction over the past year, so that our political work is more closely integrated with economic work and plays the role of guarantee and supervision of political work in basic construction. Local party committees must strengthen the leadership of Party work and political work in basic construction.
    The task of basic construction is arduous and heavy. The working conditions and living conditions of all cadres, technical personnel, especially the vast number of basic construction workers working in basic construction, are more difficult than those in production departments. In the past, the security work and the welfare work of employees were not good enough in many places. It must be recognized that basic construction is a long-term task, and we must pay more attention to improving the safety and welfare work in basic construction in a more planned way in the future.
    All preparations for next year's basic construction must be done well. Design work, surveying work, material supply, and all construction preparations must be done on schedule. This is a huge issue of whether construction can start on schedule next year and whether the national task can be completed.
    I hope that all advanced producers and advanced workers will not be arrogant or complacent, and will be good at uniting the masses, good at doing the work of taking apprentices, and improving the technical level of our basic construction, so that our country's economic construction will advance rapidly!

    东北人民政府林枫副主席在东北基本建设
    先进生产者代表会议上的讲话
    （一）
    东北的工业建设，在毛主席和中央的领导下，依靠全体工人阶级，在苏联专家的帮助下，经过几年的艰苦奋斗，到一九五二年底其生产总值已经可以预料比历史上最高水平（一九四三年）超过百分之十。工业在整个国民经济中的比重将提高到百分之五十五点九。今年工业基本建设的投资，新建和改造部分已占百分之七十点四。这些情况说明东北的工业建设已经基本上完成了恢复和改造的任务，开始走向大规模经济建设的新时期，基本建设在整个经济建设中，已提到了首要地位。做好基本建设工作，对国家的工业化是有决定意义的，是关系我国百年大计的问题。这次召开的基本建设先进生产者代表会议，总结基本建设的经验，奖励各方面的先进生产者，对于提高今后的基本建设工作具有重大意义。
    一年来，东北基本建设的新建与改造工作已获得了巨大的成绩：
    今年我们已经开始了过去从来没有过的、复杂的、规模庞大的、对我国工业化有决定意义的基本建设：开始新建大规模的钢铁厂、发电站、煤矿和最新式的亚麻厂以及其它各种厂房、学校和宿舍的建设。根据十月末统计，东北地区基本建设工程总量已经完成了百分之八十三点七，就全区来讲，房屋建筑的砌砖，混凝土等工程现已基本上完工，目前正在进行的是机器安装工程，某些重大的工程正在进行着冬季作业，以便按期完成整个工程量。
    随着基本建设任务的完成，我们今年组成了三十万人的基本建设大军，建立了六十三个工程公司和四个工程大队，这个队伍比去年扩大了很多。在这个队伍中有建筑工人二十四万四千人，有技术人员九千人，有了四万五千名基本建设的管理干部与一般职员，这个庞大的队伍就是完成我们今年基本建设任务的基本力量。基本建设工作由于发挥了工人阶级的积极性和高度创造性，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们在工程设计、地质勘察、现场管理、政治工作等各个方面都摸到了一些初步经验，并涌现了大批的先进生产者。今天到会的就是先进生产者中的一部分。
    这次到会的包括基本建设中担任各种工作的同志，你们在基本建设工作中，进行了忘我的劳动，创造了很多先进经验，在整个工作中起了带头作用和推动作用，保证了基本建设的工程质量，加速了工程进度、降低了工程成本，希望你们继续努力，在各方面创造更多的先进经验，进一步掌握先进技术，把基本建设工作做的更好，以加速我国的工业化。
    （二）
    一年来在基本建设中我们已经创造和推广了一些先进经验，这些先进经验都起了一定的作用。
    例如在矿井建设中的平行作业法，地质钻探中的马文志快速钻探法，机械安装中的预安装、分部组合安装法，施工管理中的平行流水循环操作法等。苏长有砌砖法、杨德重抹灰法、谢万福木工流水作业法等更是人人都知道的。这些先进经验都大大加快了我们工业建设的速度，如西安竖井按照旧的先凿岩、后砌壁的单行作业施工法需要十年修完，现在用平行作业法，五年就可以出煤。在土木建筑方面，实行按指示图表平行流水作业法，平均都缩短了工期三分之一。马文志快速钻探平均日进八点三四公尺，比旧的钻探法提高效率三倍，今年九月底止，工业部系统已有三十四个马文志式钻探小组了。哈尔滨推广苏长有小组双手挤浆法平均每人每天砌砖一千六百块，阜新发电厂、鞍山钢铁公司实行预安装与组合安装，都大大加快了工程进度。
    虽然有了上述成绩，但是在先进经验的创造与推广上还是有缺点的。表现在：
    对先进经验的表扬奖励以及帮助其总结提高做得还不及时、不具体。
    在先进经验的创造和推广工作中还有自流现象，先进经验的推广工作还很不平衡，如沈阳南湖工地苏长有砌砖法推广面只达百分之三十五，谢万福流水作业推广面只达到百分之二十。其次还有些干部空喊推广先进经验如何重要，但自己不熟悉也没有好好地钻研先进经验，如鸡西矿务局基本建设公司，在干部中进行马文志快速钻探具体内容的测验时，二十八名干部只有二人及格，总平均分是二十五分，有的对先进经验的基本内容不懂，因而就不能具体深入地进行推广和提高的工作。
    先进经验的创造和推广范围在土木工程方面多，在机械基础工程方面、机械安装方面比较少，今后工业基本建设的先进经验应向各方面发掘，包括设计、施工、管理、政治工作等方面都要有先进的工作方法，只有这样，才能使我们的基本建设工作平行发展。其次在数量上、进度上已有先进经验，今后在提高质量、厉行节约方面也同样需要创造先进经验。（三）
    基本建设乃是我们国家的百年大计，是实现国家工业化的基础。因之，摆在全体职工面前的主要任务是：
    要使建设成的每个建筑工程都是坚固的、耐久的、合乎设计标准的，这就是说必须保障工程的质量。
    每个工程队在建筑和安装一个工程时，要按期移交给生产部门，以便迅速进行生产，这就是说建筑要迅速，要快。
    要尽量减缩每一工程的经费消耗，节省材料，减少和消灭窝工、反工现象，这就是说：建筑要节约，要省钱。
    要好、要快、要省，这是党和政府对基本建设的基本要求。也就是向全体基本建设工作同志和工人同志们提出的要求。在现在能够达成三个要求的主要方法之一，就是创造先进经验和先进工作方法，并很好的推广带有决定性的先进经验和先进的工作方法。由于基本建设已提到首要地位，基本建设的投资和职工数目是很大的，基本建设现场又是分散的、大量的手工业式的生产，我们在这方面的工作又是极端生疏的，因之，存在着极大的潜在力，急需我们去挖掘。任何一个窍门、任何一个机械或半机械工具代替手工业工具，任何一个合理化的分工分业的有机联合的劳动组织，代替分散的个体劳动，都将大大提高劳动生产率。
    我们中国的工业基础是薄弱的，不仅技术落后，基础太狭，而且主要的只是轻工业。东北地区的工业，虽较他处为多，重工业的比重也较大，但是这些工业是在日本帝国主义实行掠夺政策下建立起来的，它带有殖民地性质，这些工业主要是原料开采业。其中机械制造业很薄弱。因此，我们必须大大地扩大我们工业基础，用新的装备来改造和建设我们的工业，尤其是建设为国家工业化所必需的工程，这是当前最根本的任务，这是稳步推向工业化的关键。我们的基本建设工作，就要担负起建设这种新的重工业、国防工业、机械工业的任务。这个任务是艰巨的，但是必须完成。可是我们目前基本建设的力量，与我们的巨大任务比较起来，还是很不相称的，我们的基本建设任务还是逐年增加的，只有迅速增长我们的基本建设力量，才能适应这个任务的要求。
    怎样来迅速增长我们的力量呢？除有计划地举办各种专门的学院、专科学校，各种专科训练班进行各种基本建设人员的训练外，还必须从各个生产部门抽调人员，充实基本建设的机构，特别是要加强设计、地质、施工及管理机构，扩大基本建设的力量，使基本建设有足够的技术干部、管理干部和固定工人，以适应大规模基本建设的需要。要在实际工作中积极地训练和提高我们现有的干部、技术人员和全体工人。如阜新发电厂的安装工程，根据苏联专家的建议，在施工中工种单纯化和技工带徒弟的经验是很好的，既完成了任务，又训练出技工，扩大了基本建设力量，这一经验应加以总结并很好地推广。
    目前，特别在今年冬季我希望做好下列几件事：
    首先在施工部门要有计划地逐步增加固定工人，进行冬季整训、进行政治思想教育和技术教育，总结一九五二年施工经验，交流先进经验，以便把固定工人的思想觉悟和技术水平提高一步，使他们成为明年基本建设的骨干。
    设计与勘察的部门，亦要总结几年来设计与勘察的经验，研究已有的苏联代为设计的资料和中国旧有的企业的设计资料，必要时应该到现场进行研究，要根据新的设计标准，达到设计标准化，逐步地有重点的工厂化，专业化。要求设计和勘察工作能够及时准确地完成任务，克服设计落后于施工的现象，否则就会妨碍整个基本建设任务的如期完成，就推迟了我们工业化的时间。
    我们的领导干部应该总结施工管理和组织领导的经验，学会全套基本建设组织管理工作，搞好劳动组织，充分运用现有的设备能力和技术条件，逐步扩大基本建设中机械化的程度和运用的范围，加强施工管理及技术等方面的责任制，在保证质量的基础上，定期完成计划，实行经济核算制。
    我们的政治工作人员及基本建设中的党的组织、工会、青年团要总结一年来在基本建设中进行政治工作的经验，使我们政治工作与经济工作更密切结合起来，发挥政治工作在基本建设中的保证和监督作用。地方党委必须加强对基本建设中党的工作和政治工作的领导。
    基本建设的任务是艰巨的、繁重的。在基本建设中工作的全体干部、技术人员，特别是广大的基本建设工人，他们的劳动条件和生活条件比生产部门更加艰苦，过去的保安工作和职工福利工作还有很多地方做的不够好，必须认识，基本建设是长期的工作，今后必须更有计划地注意改善基本建设中的安全福利工作。
    必须做好明年的基本建设的一切准备工作。必须按期做好设计工作，勘察工作，材料供应和一切施工准备，这是明年能否按期开工，能否完成国家任务的巨大问题。
    希望所有的先进生产者和先进工作者，不骄傲、不自满、并能够善于团结群众，善于做好带徒弟的工作，把我们的基本建设的技术水平提高一步，使我们国家的经济建设迅速前进！
