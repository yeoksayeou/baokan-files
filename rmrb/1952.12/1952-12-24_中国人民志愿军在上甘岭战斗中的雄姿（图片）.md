    Our anti-aircraft machine gun units fire at enemy planes to protect logistics and transportation.
    The victory of the Battle of Shangganling is inseparable from the active support of the Korean people. They organized stretcher teams, set up tea stations along the roads to the front lines, and washed quilts and clothes for the soldiers. The picture shows a field hospital in a certain place in Korea, where Korean women hand over the washed quilts to the nurses. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Commanders and fighters of our army on the Korean front have demonstrated a high degree of wisdom and creativity, relying on their diligent hands to complete the construction of deep tunnel fortifications on the Korean front.

    我炮兵部队的大口径炮正向敌人阵地猛烈射击。
    我军高射机枪部队向敌机射击，保护后勤运输。
    上甘岭战斗的胜利，是和朝鲜人民的积极支援分不开的。他们组织担架队，在通达前线的路上设置茶水站，为战士洗被褥和衣服。图为朝鲜某地的战地医院，朝鲜妇女把洗净的被褥交给护士。（新华社稿）
