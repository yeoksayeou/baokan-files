    Li Wenke, Taiyuan Brick Factory No. 3, Continuously Improves Kiln Firing Methods Three Times

    To the Editor: Li Wenke, a model worker at the Taiyuan Brick Factory No. 3, has continuously improved kiln firing methods three times during the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, saving a large amount of coal for the country. Recently, he further improved the kiln firing method by successfully experimenting with "laying coal on the brick blanks inside the kiln and igniting layer by layer." Coal consumption was reduced from twelve liang per green brick to eight liang and six qian. Each kiln firing saves the country more than two tons of coal. The quality of the products has also improved compared to the past, with the fired green bricks producing a loud sound and uniform color.

    太原窑厂第三分厂李文科连续三次改进烧窑方法
    编辑同志：太原窑厂第三分厂劳动模范李文科，在爱国增产节约运动中，曾连续三次改进烧窑方法，为国家节约大量煤炭。最近他又改进了烧窑的方法，用“在窑内砖坯上铺煤，层层引火”的方法，试验烧窑成功。煤耗由烧青砖一块用煤十二两，降低到八两六钱，烧一窑砖就给国家节约二吨多煤炭。产品质量也较前提高，烧出的青砖声音响亮，颜色均匀。　元松　王士俊
