    Many Private Industrial and Commercial Households in Beijing Illegally Owe or Underpay Union Dues

    To the Editor: The Beijing Qianmen, Chongwen, Xisi, Dongdan and other district trade unions recently focused on checking the situation of some private enterprises' capitalists implementing the provisions of the Trade Union Law regarding the allocation and payment of trade union funds. The results revealed that the phenomenon of owing and underpaying trade union funds is widespread and serious. The Qianmen District Federation of Trade Unions inspected 494 private industrial and commercial households in one industry (including ten guilds such as hardware, electrical materials, copper, iron, and tin) in the district's hardware industry. Among them, 275 households owed or underpaid union dues, accounting for more than 55% of the total. In Xisi District, there were more than 2,700 private industrial and commercial households in the entire district that should have allocated and paid union dues, but only more than 1,700 households paid union dues each month. Among the 87 automobile businesses, 34 had not paid. Among the 522 private industrial and commercial households inspected in Dongdan District, only 35 paid union dues according to law, while 382 did not pay at all.

    Among these private industrial and commercial households that do not allocate and pay union dues according to law, a few have not paid at all from the date they should have started paying union dues (Beijing stipulated from September 1950) until now, the longest period being more than two years; some have the ability to pay but do not pay monthly, interrupting for several months without reason; some underreport the number of employees or the actual total wage (such as concealing temporary wages, food allowances, overtime pay, and bonuses), thus underpaying union dues; some have not paid without reason or on the pretext after the "Five-Anti" movement; and some capitalists make workers pay union dues (such as the Qianmen District Renchangxiang Porcelain Shop capitalist who made workers pay union dues from September 1950 to October this year), or labor and capital each pay half (such as Xisi District Yi Da Pharmacy).

    These capitalists' illegal acts have affected the statutory income of union dues and the development of workers' cultural education and recreational activities. According to the preliminary statistics of 275 households in Qianmen District that were found to be owing or underpaying, the amount underpaid reached more than 40 million yuan. Xisi District estimates that the entire district collects 40 to 50 million yuan less per month, and 500 to 600 million yuan less per year.

    The continued occurrence of this situation after the "Five-Anti" movement is intolerable. We request the People's Government to take appropriate action against these illegal capitalists according to law.

    北京市不少私营工商户违法欠交或少交工会经费
    编辑同志：北京市前门、崇文、西四、东单等区工会最近重点检查了部分私营企业的资方执行工会法规定拨缴工会经费的情况，结果发现欠交、少交工会经费的现象是普遍而严重的。前门区工会检查了该区五金业一个行业（包括五金、电料、铜铁锡等十个同业公会）的四百九十四户私营工商户，其中欠交或少交工会经费的就有二百七十五户，占总数百分之五十五以上。西四区全区应拨交工会经费的私营工商户共二千七百余户，每月只有一千七百余户拨交工会经费。在八十七户汽车业中，就有三十四户未交。东单区被检查的五百二十二户私营工商户中，依法拨交工会经费者只有三十五户，完全不交者竟有三百八十二户。
    这些不依法拨交工会经费的私营工商户中，有少数是从应拨交工会经费之日起（北京市规定从一九五○年九月份起）到现在根本未交的，时间最长的竟达两年多；有的是有力缴纳而不按月缴纳，无故间断几个月的；有的是少报职工人数或实际工资总额（如隐瞒临时工资、伙食费、加班费和奖金等），少缴工会经费的；有的是在“五反”运动后无故或借故不交的；也有的是资方让工人缴纳工会经费（如前门区仁昌祥磁庄资方从一九五○年九月至今年十月都是让工人交工会经费），或劳资各缴半数的（如西四区义大药房）。
    这些资本家的违法行为，已影响了法定的工会经费收入以及职工文化教育和文娱活动的开展。根据前门区检查出欠交或少交的二百七十五户的初步统计，少交数目就达四千多万元。西四区估计全区每月少收四、五千万元，一年就少收五、六亿元。
    这种情况在“五反”运动后仍继续出现，是令人不能容忍的。我们要求人民政府对这些违法资本家依法作适当的处理。
