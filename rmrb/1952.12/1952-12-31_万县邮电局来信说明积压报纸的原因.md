    Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

    Wanxian Postal and Telecommunications Bureau Sends Letter Explaining Reasons for Backlog of Newspapers
    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" column of the November 23rd People's Daily published criticisms from readers Zhang Wenlin and Li Zhixiang regarding our bureau's backlog of newspapers. Our bureau immediately conducted an investigation after seeing the report and discovered that various newspapers and periodicals published in Beijing were frequently experiencing periods of several days without newspapers or a sudden arrival of several issues at once, due to irregular ship transportation. For example, on November 28th, we received newspapers for seven days, including the 13th and 15th. On December 7th, the Huatong vessel transported newspapers for six days from Yichang, covering November 22nd to 27th. Sometimes, newspapers were backlogged for as long as ten days. This phenomenon exists not only in our bureau but also in postal bureaus along the Yangtze River and even throughout the Southwest region. To improve this situation, our bureau has repeatedly reported to higher authorities requesting improvements, but a thorough solution has not yet been achieved. Therefore, in addition to continuing to rectify and strengthen distribution work based on the spirit of the readers' criticism, we hope that higher-level leading authorities will find ways to quickly make comprehensive improvements so that newspapers can reach readers promptly.

    万县邮电局来信说明积压报纸的原因
    编辑同志：十一月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了读者张文林、李致祥对我局积压报纸的现象提出批评。我局见报后立即进行了检查，发现北京出版的各种报刊因轮船运输不正常，经常发生几天无报或一次来数期报刊的现象。如：十一月二十八日就收到十三、十五等七天的报纸。十二月七日，由华同轮自宜昌运来十一月二十二到二十七日共六天的报纸。有时，报纸竟积压十天之久。这种现象不但在我局存在，就是在沿长江各邮局甚至在西南全区都是存在的。为了改善这种情况，我局曾多次向上级反映要求改进，但是一直没有得到彻底解决。因此我们除了依据读者批评的精神继续整顿和加强发行工作外，希望上级领导机关设法迅速作全面改善，以使报纸迅速到达读者手中。
