Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from New York: On December 3rd, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting to vote on the Indian proposal regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea, the Soviet amendment to this proposal, and the Soviet proposal regarding the Korean issue.

American newspapers, in commenting on the passage of the Indian proposal by the US-British majority bloc in the Political Committee, are increasingly blatantly revealing what lies behind the notorious Indian proposal. For example, "The Christian Science Monitor" emphasized that the Indian proposal openly endorsed the American stance on the issue of prisoner repatriation.

Indian representative Menon's speech at the plenary meeting naturally failed to dispel this impression. The Soviet delegation had already pointed out that the Indian proposal did not demand a ceasefire and that its purpose was not to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. In order to conceal this fact, Menon suggested adding a sentence to the preamble of the Indian proposal that would not be binding on anyone: that a ceasefire would be implemented after an agreement on prisoner repatriation was reached according to the Indian proposal. In reality, this was merely a play on words and did not change the substance of the issue. To date, the Indian proposal has not put forward a demand for the cessation of military actions in Korea.

Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky spoke at the meeting. He first pointed out that during the Political Committee's discussion of the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the Political Committee had to discuss all aspects of the entire Korean issue, and therefore the scope of this issue had been greatly expanded.

Vyshinsky then spoke about the American proposal. He said that although we are not directly facing the American proposal now, it must be mentioned because the Indian proposal is organically linked to it. Vyshinsky pointed out that the purpose of the American proposal is very clearly to continue the war of aggression against Korea, and as the debate in the Political Committee on this proposal showed, even the American delegation could not expect this proposal to be passed. The Peruvian and Mexican proposals also could not save this situation; they were simply no different from the American proposal. In this situation, the Indian proposal emerged; this proposal is based on the principles of the American proposal, although it has been changed in form.

After pointing out that the Indian proposal does not guarantee the fulfillment of the Geneva Convention regarding the unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war and does not even mention the important issue of Korean unification, Vyshinsky went on to say that the Indian proposal does not contain anything that could immediately stop the Korean War. The amendment presented by the Indian delegation today has not changed this situation in any way, because according to its amendment, the ceasefire is conditional on both sides reaching a truce agreement, and not, as stipulated in the Soviet proposal, through a resolution to immediately and completely cease military actions in Korea. Without an immediate and complete ceasefire, there can be no talk of the first step towards peace in Korea. Article 12 of the armistice agreement that the warring parties have already reached an agreement on has already stipulated the specific conditions for a ceasefire; the only necessary action is to pass a resolution on a ceasefire, but the Indian proposers and other delegations supporting this proposal have consistently opposed doing so. In addition, the Soviet delegation also suggested deleting from the Indian proposal the provisions regarding the composition and powers of the repatriation commission.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying that in view of the above-mentioned serious shortcomings of the Indian proposal, and the rejection of the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation would vote against the Indian proposal. The purpose of the Indian proposal is not to end the war, but to continue and prolong the war. Only by immediately stopping the Korean War and unconditionally repatriating all Korean-Chinese and American prisoners of war can a real and effective path to resolving the Korean issue be opened up.

The Australian representative spoke next, and he tried his best to emphasize that an immediate ceasefire was not the purpose of the Indian proposal.

The Iranian representative spoke and said that he fully agreed with the arguments of the Soviet amendment. However, violating the clear facts, he insisted that the Indian proposal reflected these arguments.

Then, the Soviet amendment to the Indian proposal was put to a vote. As expected, the core of aggression within the United Nations voted against all the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union. The Soviet, Polish, Czechoslovak, Ukrainian, and Belarusian delegations voted in favor of the Soviet amendment. Nine delegations abstained from voting on the two amendments proposed by the Soviet Union calling for an immediate cessation of military actions in Korea and calling for the establishment of a committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue (Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Burma, Indonesia, and India). Representatives of some Arab and Asian countries also abstained when voting on other amendments proposed by the Soviet Union to the Indian proposal.

The US-British bloc passed the Indian proposal. The Soviet, Polish, Czechoslovak, Ukrainian, and Belarusian delegations voted against this proposal.

Then, some representatives spoke to explain their reasons for voting. American representative Gross, in his speech, admitted that the Indian proposal was no different from the American proposal, thereby proving that the Soviet delegation's criticism of the Indian proposal was justified. Gross praised the Indian proposal in every possible way. He pointed out that the principle of "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war followed by the United States was the basis of the Indian proposal. These words from Gross proved that the Indian proposal concealed the actions of the US military command in refusing to repatriate Korean-Chinese prisoners of war. Gross said that the Korean War would not stop until the prisoner of war issue was resolved. Therefore, he proved the complete deceitful nature of Indian representative Menon's "explanation," who insisted that his proposal stipulated the cessation of the Korean War.

The Philippine representative and the Kuomintang elements also said that the Indian proposal fully reflected the attitude of the "United Nations Command," that is, the US military command, towards the repatriation of prisoners of war.

Ukrainian Republic delegation head Baranovsky and Polish delegation head Skrzydlewski explained that they voted against the Indian proposal because the purpose of this proposal was actually not to end, but to continue the Korean War.

Czechoslovak delegation head Sekaninov√° explained the reasons for voting against the Indian proposal, stating that this proposal actually defended the American policy of aggression against Korea and did not put forward a genuine suggestion for ending the Korean War. She emphasized the great importance of the Soviet proposal for an immediate end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Soviet proposal reflected the wishes and hopes of peace-loving people in all countries. The people of all countries are expecting the United Nations to take urgent measures to end the bloodshed in Korea.

Next, the Soviet proposal on the Korean issue was put to a vote. The Soviet proposal was rejected by the US-British majority, who refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and supported the policy of the American ruling clique to continue the Korean War.

The Soviet, Polish, Ukrainian, Czechoslovak, and Belarusian delegations voted in favor of the Soviet proposal. Eleven delegations abstained (Afghanistan, Argentina, Burma, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen). Representatives from Lebanon, Liberia, Guatemala, and Haiti did not attend the meeting.

At the end of the meeting, Belarusian Republic delegation head Kiselev explained the reasons for the vote. He emphasized that the Soviet proposal demanding an immediate end to the Korean War fully conformed to the interests of peace in Asia and the world, and the interests of all peoples. The Soviet peace proposal has been unanimously supported by the Korean-Chinese people and supported by all progressive humanity. The Soviet proposal and the Soviet amendments to the Indian proposal provided full opportunities to end the Korean War most quickly and opened up the correct path to a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. However, the Indian proposal adopted by the General Assembly meant the continuation of the bloody Korean War.

The meeting was then adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from New York: At the beginning of the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 2nd, some representatives tried in vain to justify their voting against the Soviet amendments to the Indian proposal. The Soviet amendments stipulated a ceasefire in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue.

Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky delivered a brief speech explaining why the Soviet delegation voted against the Indian proposal.

Vyshinsky said: First, this proposal does not stipulate a ceasefire in Korea, and does not stipulate the cessation of hostilities. In general, the proposal does not mention a ceasefire in Korea; the proposal only mentions the Panmunjom negotiations in the preamble, which does not mean a ceasefire in Korea at all. Not a single word in the Indian proposal, the American proposal, and certain other proposals mentions the need for an immediate ceasefire on land, at sea, and in the air in Korea.

Second, this proposal does not provide any basis for resolving the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, and in this regard, the proposal blindly repeats some of the provisions that mainly imitate the suggestions in the American proposal (later called the proposal of the twenty-one-nation delegation). Regarding this issue, the Indian proposal essentially repeats the incorrect arguments in the Peruvian and Mexican proposals.

Third, this proposal does not open the road to peace, it is not the first step towards this road; in addition, its entire purpose, its entire content, first of all the fact that it does not stipulate the cessation of hostilities, objectively‚ÄîI do not want to talk about subjective motives, which are not relevant to the current matter‚Äîis to prolong the Korean War and undermine all possibilities for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. A proposal with such shortcomings cannot be supported by any delegation that is striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, striving to stop the Korean War, and striving to resolve other issues related to this issue worldwide.

The Soviet delegation voted against the Indian proposal mainly because of the above three points.

After Vyshinsky's speech, the Soviet proposal was put to a vote.

The Soviet proposal was as follows: "The General Assembly, having examined the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, deems it necessary:

Recommend that the belligerent parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both parties, that is to say, both parties cease all land, sea and air military operations, and the issue of the complete repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue as stipulated in the Soviet proposal, in which all issues shall be decided by a two-thirds majority of all members.

Establish a committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue consisting of the directly concerned parties and other countries‚Äîincluding countries that did not participate in the Korean War. This appointed commission consists of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the
