Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from New York: On December 3rd, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting to vote on the Indian proposal regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea, the Soviet amendment to this proposal, and the Soviet proposal regarding the Korean issue.

American newspapers, in commenting on the passage of the Indian proposal by the US-British majority bloc in the Political Committee, are increasingly blatantly revealing what lies behind the notorious Indian proposal. For example, "The Christian Science Monitor" emphasized that the Indian proposal openly endorsed the American stance on the issue of prisoner repatriation.

Indian representative Menon's speech at the plenary meeting naturally failed to dispel this impression. The Soviet delegation had already pointed out that the Indian proposal did not demand a ceasefire and that its purpose was not to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. In order to conceal this fact, Menon suggested adding a sentence to the preamble of the Indian proposal that would not be binding on anyone: that a ceasefire would be implemented after an agreement on prisoner repatriation was reached according to the Indian proposal. In reality, this was merely a play on words and did not change the substance of the issue. To date, the Indian proposal has not put forward a demand for the cessation of military actions in Korea.

Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky spoke at the meeting. He first pointed out that during the Political Committee's discussion of the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the Political Committee had to discuss all aspects of the entire Korean issue, and therefore the scope of this issue had been greatly expanded.

Vyshinsky then spoke about the American proposal. He said that although we are not directly facing the American proposal now, it must be mentioned because the Indian proposal is organically linked to it. Vyshinsky pointed out that the purpose of the American proposal is very clearly to continue the war of aggression against Korea, and as the debate in the Political Committee on this proposal showed, even the American delegation could not expect this proposal to be passed. The Peruvian and Mexican proposals also could not save this situation; they were simply no different from the American proposal. In this situation, the Indian proposal emerged; this proposal is based on the principles of the American proposal, although it has been changed in form.

After pointing out that the Indian proposal does not guarantee the fulfillment of the Geneva Convention regarding the unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war and does not even mention the important issue of Korean unification, Vyshinsky went on to say that the Indian proposal does not contain anything that could immediately stop the Korean War. The amendment presented by the Indian delegation today has not changed this situation in any way, because according to its amendment, the ceasefire is conditional on both sides reaching a truce agreement, and not, as stipulated in the Soviet proposal, through a resolution to immediately and completely cease military actions in Korea. Without an immediate and complete ceasefire, there can be no talk of the first step towards peace in Korea. Article 12 of the armistice agreement that the warring parties have already reached an agreement on has already stipulated the specific conditions for a ceasefire; the only necessary action is to pass a resolution on a ceasefire, but the Indian proposers and other delegations supporting this proposal have consistently opposed doing so. In addition, the Soviet delegation also suggested deleting from the Indian proposal the provisions regarding the composition and powers of the repatriation commission.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying that in view of the above-mentioned serious shortcomings of the Indian proposal, and the rejection of the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation would vote against the Indian proposal. The purpose of the Indian proposal is not to end the war, but to continue and prolong the war. Only by immediately stopping the Korean War and unconditionally repatriating all Korean-Chinese and American prisoners of war can a real and effective path to resolving the Korean issue be opened up.

The Australian representative spoke next, and he tried his best to emphasize that an immediate ceasefire was not the purpose of the Indian proposal.

The Iranian representative spoke and said that he fully agreed with the arguments of the Soviet amendment. However, violating the clear facts, he insisted that the Indian proposal reflected these arguments.

Then, the Soviet amendment to the Indian proposal was put to a vote. As expected, the core of aggression within the United Nations voted against all the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union. The Soviet, Polish, Czechoslovak, Ukrainian, and Belarusian delegations voted in favor of the Soviet amendment. Nine delegations abstained from voting on the two amendments proposed by the Soviet Union calling for an immediate cessation of military actions in Korea and calling for the establishment of a committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue (Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Burma, Indonesia, and India). Representatives of some Arab and Asian countries also abstained when voting on other amendments proposed by the Soviet Union to the Indian proposal.

The US-British bloc passed the Indian proposal. The Soviet, Polish, Czechoslovak, Ukrainian, and Belarusian delegations voted against this proposal.

Then, some representatives spoke to explain their reasons for voting. American representative Gross, in his speech, admitted that the Indian proposal was no different from the American proposal, thereby proving that the Soviet delegation's criticism of the Indian proposal was justified. Gross praised the Indian proposal in every possible way. He pointed out that the principle of "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war followed by the United States was the basis of the Indian proposal. These words from Gross proved that the Indian proposal concealed the actions of the US military command in refusing to repatriate Korean-Chinese prisoners of war. Gross said that the Korean War would not stop until the prisoner of war issue was resolved. Therefore, he proved the complete deceitful nature of Indian representative Menon's "explanation," who insisted that his proposal stipulated the cessation of the Korean War.

The Philippine representative and the Kuomintang elements also said that the Indian proposal fully reflected the attitude of the "United Nations Command," that is, the US military command, towards the repatriation of prisoners of war.

Ukrainian Republic delegation head Baranovsky and Polish delegation head Skrzydlewski explained that they voted against the Indian proposal because the purpose of this proposal was actually not to end, but to continue the Korean War.

Czechoslovak delegation head Sekaninová explained the reasons for voting against the Indian proposal, stating that this proposal actually defended the American policy of aggression against Korea and did not put forward a genuine suggestion for ending the Korean War. She emphasized the great importance of the Soviet proposal for an immediate end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Soviet proposal reflected the wishes and hopes of peace-loving people in all countries. The people of all countries are expecting the United Nations to take urgent measures to end the bloodshed in Korea.

Next, the Soviet proposal on the Korean issue was put to a vote. The Soviet proposal was rejected by the US-British majority, who refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and supported the policy of the American ruling clique to continue the Korean War.

The Soviet, Polish, Ukrainian, Czechoslovak, and Belarusian delegations voted in favor of the Soviet proposal. Eleven delegations abstained (Afghanistan, Argentina, Burma, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen). Representatives from Lebanon, Liberia, Guatemala, and Haiti did not attend the meeting.

At the end of the meeting, Belarusian Republic delegation head Kiselev explained the reasons for the vote. He emphasized that the Soviet proposal demanding an immediate end to the Korean War fully conformed to the interests of peace in Asia and the world, and the interests of all peoples. The Soviet peace proposal has been unanimously supported by the Korean-Chinese people and supported by all progressive humanity. The Soviet proposal and the Soviet amendments to the Indian proposal provided full opportunities to end the Korean War most quickly and opened up the correct path to a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. However, the Indian proposal adopted by the General Assembly meant the continuation of the bloody Korean War.

The meeting was then adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from New York: At the beginning of the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 2nd, some representatives tried in vain to justify their voting against the Soviet amendments to the Indian proposal. The Soviet amendments stipulated a ceasefire in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue.

Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky delivered a brief speech explaining why the Soviet delegation voted against the Indian proposal.

Vyshinsky said: First, this proposal does not stipulate a ceasefire in Korea, and does not stipulate the cessation of hostilities. In general, the proposal does not mention a ceasefire in Korea; the proposal only mentions the Panmunjom negotiations in the preamble, which does not mean a ceasefire in Korea at all. Not a single word in the Indian proposal, the American proposal, and certain other proposals mentions the need for an immediate ceasefire on land, at sea, and in the air in Korea.

Second, this proposal does not provide any basis for resolving the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, and in this regard, the proposal blindly repeats some of the provisions that mainly imitate the suggestions in the American proposal (later called the proposal of the twenty-one-nation delegation). Regarding this issue, the Indian proposal essentially repeats the incorrect arguments in the Peruvian and Mexican proposals.

Third, this proposal does not open the road to peace, it is not the first step towards this road; in addition, its entire purpose, its entire content, first of all the fact that it does not stipulate the cessation of hostilities, objectively—I do not want to talk about subjective motives, which are not relevant to the current matter—is to prolong the Korean War and undermine all possibilities for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. A proposal with such shortcomings cannot be supported by any delegation that is striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, striving to stop the Korean War, and striving to resolve other issues related to this issue worldwide.

The Soviet delegation voted against the Indian proposal mainly because of the above three points.

After Vyshinsky's speech, the Soviet proposal was put to a vote.

The Soviet proposal was as follows: "The General Assembly, having examined the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, deems it necessary:

Recommend that the belligerent parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both parties, that is to say, both parties cease all land, sea and air military operations, and the issue of the complete repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue as stipulated in the Soviet proposal, in which all issues shall be decided by a two-thirds majority of all members.

Establish a committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue consisting of the directly concerned parties and other countries—including countries that did not participate in the Korean War. This appointed commission consists of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the

    联大全会在美英集团操纵下通过印度提案并否决苏联提案
    维辛斯基指出印度提案旨在继续朝鲜战争
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：十二月三日，联合国大会全体会议举行会议，表决印度关于遣返朝鲜境内战俘的提案和苏联对这个提案的修正案，以及苏联关于朝鲜问题的提案。
    美国报纸在评论政治委员会中美英多数集团通过印度提案时，越来越露骨地说明了臭名远扬的印度提案背后到底是什么东西。举例说，“基督教科学箴言报”强调说，印度的提案是公开赞成美国在遣俘问题上的态度的。
    印度代表梅农在全体会议上的发言，自然无法消除这种印象。苏联代表团已经指出印度提案中并没有要求停火，这个提案的目的也不是要和平解决朝鲜问题；梅农为了掩饰这一事实，就建议在印度提案的序文中强加一句对任何人都没有约束力的话：在根据印度提案达成遣返战俘的协议后便实行停火。实际上，这只是在文字上耍花样，并不能改变问题的实质。到目前为止，印度提案中一直没有提出停止朝鲜军事行动的要求。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会上发言。他首先指出，在政治委员会讨论朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告期间，政治委员会不得不讨论到整个朝鲜问题的各个方面，因而这个问题的范围已大大扩大了。
    维辛斯基接着谈到美国提案。他说，虽然现在我们不是直接面对着美国提案，但必须提到它，因为印度提案是和它有机地联系着的。维辛斯基指出，美国提案的目的非常明显地是要继续进行侵略朝鲜的战争，像政治委员会关于这个提案的辩论所表现的那样，连美国代表团也不能指望这个提案被通过。秘鲁与墨西哥提案也拯救不了这种情势，它们与美国提案简直没有什么区别。在这种情况下，出现了印度提案；这个提案根据的是美国提案的原则，虽然在形式上有所改变。
    维辛斯基在指出印度提案没有保证履行日内瓦公约关于无条件遣返全部战俘的规定，并且甚至没有提到像朝鲜统一这样重要的问题之后，接着又说，印度提案中并没有任何可以使朝鲜战争立刻停止的东西。印度代表团今天提出的修正，并没有使这种情况有任何改变，因为按照它的修正，停火是以双方达成停战协议为条件的，而不是像苏联提案所规定的那样，通过立即完全停止在朝鲜的军事行动的决议。不立即完全停战，就谈不到走向朝鲜和平的第一步。交战双方已经获致协议的停战协定第十二款中已经规定了停火的具体条件，唯一必要的行动就是通过关于停火的决议，而印度提案人和支持这个提案的其他代表团却一直反对这样做。此外，苏联代表团还建议从印度提案中删除关于遣返委员会组成及其职权的规定。
    维辛斯基最后说，鉴于印度提案有着上述的严重缺点，而苏联所提出的修正又遭到拒绝，苏联代表团将投票反对印度提案。印度提案的目的不是要结束战争，而是要继续和拖延战争。只有立刻停止朝鲜战争，无条件遣返全部朝中战俘和美方战俘，才能开辟真正的、有效的解决朝鲜问题的道路。
    澳大利亚代表接着发言，他竭力强调说明立即停火不是印度提案的宗旨。
    伊朗代表发言说，他完全同意苏联修正案的主张。但是，他违反着明白的事实，硬说印度提案反映了这些主张。
    于是，苏联对印度提案的修正案付表决。如所预料，联合国内的侵略核心投票反对苏联提出的一切修正。苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯代表团投票赞成苏联修正案。在投票表决苏联提出的主张立即停止朝鲜军事行动以及主张成立一个和平解决朝鲜问题委员会两项修正时，九个代表团弃权（沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门、阿富汗、伊朗、埃及、缅甸、印尼和印度）。一些阿拉伯及亚洲国家的代表在表决苏联对印度提案提出的其他修正时，同样也弃了权。
    美英集团通过了印度提案。苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯代表团投票反对这个提案。
    然后，一些代表发言说明他们投票的理由。美国代表葛罗斯在发言中承认印度提案与美国提案没有不同，从而证明了苏联代表团对印度提案的批评是公正的。葛罗斯对印度提案备加赞扬。他指出，美国所遵循的“自愿遣返”战俘的原则是印度提案的基础。葛罗斯这些话正证明印度提案掩饰了美军司令部拒绝遣返朝中战俘的行为。葛罗斯说，在战俘问题解决以前，朝鲜战争是不会停止的。因此，他证明了印度代表梅农的“解释”的全然欺骗性质，梅农硬说他的提案规定了停止朝鲜战争。
    菲律宾代表和国民党分子也同样说，印度提案充分反映了“联合国军司令部”、也就是美军司令部对遣返战俘的态度。
    乌克兰共和国代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基和波兰代表团团长斯克列杰夫斯基说明投票反对印度提案，是由于这个提案的目的实际上不是要结束，而是要继续朝鲜战争。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃说明投票反对印度提案的理由是，这个提案实际上卫护美国侵略朝鲜政策，而没有提出结束朝鲜战争的真正建议。她着重指出苏联提出的立即结束朝鲜战争及和平解决朝鲜问题的建议的极大重要性。苏联的建议反映了世界各国爱好和平人民的愿望和希望。世界各国人民正在期待联合国采取紧急措施来终止朝鲜的流血。
    接着，苏联关于朝鲜问题的提案付表决。苏联提案被美英多数所否决，他们拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，支持美国统治集团继续朝鲜战争的政策。
    苏联、波兰、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克和白俄罗斯代表团投票赞成苏联提案。十一个代表团弃权（阿富汗、阿根廷、缅甸、埃及、印度、印尼、伊朗、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和也门）。黎巴嫩、利比里亚、危地马拉和海地四国代表没有参加会议。
    在会议结束的时候，白俄罗斯共和国代表团团长基塞列夫解释投票理由。他着重指出苏联要求立即结束朝鲜战争的建议，完全符合亚洲与全世界和平的利益和各国人民的利益。苏联的和平建议已经获得朝中人民的一致拥护和所有进步人类的支持。苏联提案和苏联对印度提案的修正，提供了最迅速地结束朝鲜战争的充分机会，并打开了和平解决整个朝鲜问题的正确道路。但是，大会所通过的印度提案却意味着血腥的朝鲜战争的继续。
    会议至此休会。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：在联合国大会政治委员会二日会议开始的时候，一些代表徒然地企图为他们投票反对苏联对印度提案的修正案辩解。苏联的修正案规定在朝鲜停火以及和平解决整个朝鲜问题。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表了简短的演说，说明为什么苏联代表团投票反对印度提案。
    维辛斯基说：第一，这个提案没有规定在朝鲜停火，没有规定停止敌对行为。总的说来，提案并没有提到要在朝鲜停火，提案只在序文里提到板门店谈判，而这根本并不意味着朝鲜的停火。印度提案、美国提案和某些其它提案中一个字也没有说到有必要立即在朝鲜的陆上、海上和空中停火。
    第二，这个提案根本就没有提供任何解决交换战俘问题的基础，而在这方面，这个提案盲目地重复了一些主要模仿美国提案（以后称为二十一国代表团提案）中的建议的规定。关于这个问题，印度提案在实质上重复了秘鲁和墨西哥提案中的不正确论点。
    第三，这个提案并没有打开走向和平的道路，并不是走向这条道路的第一步；此外，它的整个目的，它的全部内容，首先是它没有规定停止敌对行为这个事实，在客观上——我不想谈主观动机，这与目前这件事没有关系——是要拖延朝鲜战争，破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的所有可能性。有这种缺点的提案不能得到任何努力和平解决朝鲜问题、努力停止朝鲜战争、努力解决全世界与这个问题有关的其他问题的代表团的支持。
    苏联代表团为什么投票反对印度提案，主要就是因为上述三点。
    维辛斯基演说后，苏联提案交付表决。
    苏联提案如下：“大会研究了朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告，认为有必要：
    建议朝鲜的交战双方按照双方已经同意的停战协定草案，立即完全停火，就是说双方停止一切陆、海、空军事行动，战俘全部遣返的问题应交给苏联提案所规定的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会去解决，在这个委员会中一切问题要经全体成员三分之二多数赞成决定。
    设立一个由直接有关的各方以及其他国家——其中包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家——参加的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会。这个任命的委员会由美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜组成。
    责成上述委员会本着由朝鲜人自己在上述委员会的监督下统一朝鲜的精神，立即采取解决朝鲜问题的措施，其中包括尽量协助双方遣返全部战俘的措施。”
    五个代表团（苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰共和国、波兰和白俄罗斯共和国）投票赞成苏联提案。十二个代表团（沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、阿富汗、阿根廷、缅甸、埃及、印度、印尼、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和巴基斯坦）弃权。也门和厄瓜多尔的代表没有参加投票。
    值得注意的是：印度、巴基斯坦和伊拉克的代表在表决苏联提案的时候弃了权，而他们在十二月一日委员会会议上是投票反对苏联对印度提案的修正案的。在表决苏联提案的时候，弃权的还有阿根廷代表团，它在十二月一日也是投票反对苏联修正案的。由于畏惧公众舆论对于制止美国侵略朝鲜行为的要求，许多国家的代表不得不采取规避的行动。
    联合国里以美国为首的侵略核心投票反对主张立即在朝鲜停火并尽早和平解决整个朝鲜问题的苏联提案。
