Editor's Note: In 1938, the reactionary Kuomintang government, disregarding the lives of millions of people, breached the Yellow River levee at Huayuankou in Henan Province, flooding over 17 million mu of farmland in more than 40 counties in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, leaving over 6.1 million people homeless and creating a desolate Yellow River flood area. The farmers in the eastern Henan Yellow River flood area, who suffered the most at the time, recently wrote to this newspaper reporting that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they have harnessed the river channels silted up by the floodwaters, organized themselves to cultivate all the wasteland, established wind and sandbreak forest belts, and gradually increased the harvest of farmland. Their living standards have rapidly caught up with those of farmers in general areas. Under the direct influence of the mechanized state-owned Yellow River Flood Area Farm, they have realized their bright and happy future. From these letters, we can see that every corner of the new China is developing by leaps and bounds.

    今日黄泛区人民的幸福生活
    编者按：一九三八年国民党反动政府不顾千百万人民的生命，从河南省花园口掘开黄河大堤，淹没河南、安徽、江苏三省四十余县一千七百余万亩农田，使六百一十余万人民流离失所，造成了一片荒芜的黄泛区。当时受灾最惨重的豫东黄泛区的农民，在最近给本报来信，报告他们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，已经整治了被黄水淤没的河道，组织起来垦种了所有的荒地，建立着防风、防沙的防护林带，逐年提高了农田的收获，生活水平已迅速地赶上了一般地区的农民了。他们在机械耕作的国营黄泛区农场直接影响下，认识到自己美好幸福的前途。从这几封来信里我们可以看到：在新中国每个角落里都是飞跃地在发展着。
