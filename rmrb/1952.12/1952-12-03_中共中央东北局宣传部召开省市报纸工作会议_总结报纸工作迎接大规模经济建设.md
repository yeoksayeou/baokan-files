The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a provincial and municipal newspaper work conference from October 27th to November 8th. Ninety-one people from thirty-nine units attended, including the heads of provincial and municipal, industrial and mining newspapers, provincial and municipal youth league newspapers and periodicals, and major popular periodicals in the Northeast region, as well as some group leaders and cadres engaged in communications work from provincial and municipal newspapers. Starting from summarizing and exchanging experiences, the conference discussed how newspapers can better serve economic construction and welcome the new period of economic construction.

Over the past year, the work of various newspapers has improved. They have achieved considerable success in the publicity of economic construction. This is mainly reflected in the publicity of the Party's policies for developing production; the struggle against erroneous thoughts and behaviors that deviate from the Party's line and violate the Party's policies; the publicity of the wisdom and creativity of the working people; the publicity of the growth of new figures and new ideas; the reports on the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural life; and especially the fact that various newspapers have paid more attention to the reports on popularizing advanced experiences, which have played a certain role in promoting the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and have strengthened the connection between newspapers and reality. However, these achievements are obviously not enough compared with the needs of the development of national construction and the growing demands of the broad masses of the people for newspapers. There are still many shortcomings in the work of various newspapers, such as the one-sidedness in reporting, the old-fashioned reporting methods and forms, the lack of reports on rich mass life, some factual inaccuracies in reporting, and insufficient publicity of the superiority of the new social system, etc. Summarizing the existing experiences and overcoming the existing shortcomings have become indispensable preparations for newspaper workers to welcome the new period of national economic construction.

At the meeting, the participants first listened to the recording of Comrade Gao Gang's report "Master Technology, Be Proficient in Business, and Welcome the New Period of Economic Construction" at the Third Plenary Session of the Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and listened to Comrade Zhang Mingyuan's report on rural work issues in the Northeast region and Comrade Ma Hong's report on industrial construction in the Northeast region. These reports clearly explained the bright future of national construction and the glorious and arduous tasks we face, giving the comrades present great encouragement and strength.

The meeting also invited Luo Haishan, a worker correspondent from the Shenyang Daily, and Cui Fangmin, a farmer correspondent, to make reports. They vividly illustrated the new demands of the broad masses of workers and peasants on newspapers with concrete facts and criticized the shortcomings of the reports. Xing Shiliang, a cadre of worker origin from the Songjiang Daily, and Li Gui, a cadre of farmer origin from the Heilongjiang Daily, also made speeches, explaining how to go deep among the masses and connect with the masses based on their own personal experiences. These reports and speeches also gave the comrades present useful enlightenment.

The conference spent most of its time exchanging the experiences of various newspapers in the publicity of economic construction, especially focusing on the study of the summaries of reporting experiences of the Labor Daily, Shenyang Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, Songjiang Daily, and Changchun Xinbao on industrial and agricultural production, popularizing advanced experiences in production, basic construction, ideological criticism, etc. The reason why this conference was able to focus on systematically studying the experiences of various newspapers was mainly because two months before the conference, the main provincial and municipal newspapers had begun to conduct investigations and research, initially summarized the experiences, made relatively sufficient preparations, and improved the thinking of cadres, laying the foundation for the summary of experiences at this conference.

On the morning of November 7th, Comrade Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, made a report on "Continuing to Implement Investigation and Research, Popularization, and Improving the Ideological and Professional Level of Newspaper Work." In his report, Comrade Liu Zhiming first pointed out that welcoming the new period of economic construction and making newspapers better serve economic construction is an arduous task. To accomplish this task, we must improve newspaper work a step further. Where is the key to improving newspaper work a step further? It lies in: 1. Strengthening the study of theoretical and practical knowledge of economic construction; 2. Strengthening the professional study of newspaper work, the best way is to summarize experiences in a timely manner; 3. Strengthening contact with the Party Committee, taking the initiative to obtain the leadership of the Party Committee; strengthening extensive contact with the masses, and paying attention to reflecting the opinions and requirements of the masses. Then, Comrade Liu Zhiming concentrated on the experiences of various newspapers, systematized them, and raised them to the level of ideological principles as the basic experiences of newspaper work. These basic experiences are: 1. Relying on the Party Committee, taking the initiative to obtain the leadership of the Party Committee, and being good at understanding the intentions of the Party Committee; not only maintaining close contact with the Party Committee organs and the responsible comrades of the Party Committee, but also maintaining close contact with the various departments led by the Party; 2. Extensively contacting the masses, conducting investigation and research, combining with the current practical work, grasping the ideological problems with universality among the masses, combining this ideological problem with the Party's policies and the specific problems in the current work, and launching systematic criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper; 3. Grasping typical examples, setting examples, and using living people, living events, and living principles for publicity; not only being good at raising questions, but also being good at solving problems; 4. In the reporting process, combining the reported problems with the organizational work of various departments, so that newspapers can become a powerful weapon for solving ideological problems in practical work and promoting the progress of work; 5. Choosing forms that the masses like to see and hear, being good at using the language of the masses, and expressing them in a popular and vivid way. Finally, Comrade Liu Zhiming, based on the existing experiences of various newspapers, made specific instructions on industrial production reports (including popularizing advanced experiences, publicizing technology, completing and exceeding national plans, etc.), agricultural reports, basic construction reports, ideological criticism and criticism and self-criticism, continuing to implement popularization, formulating reporting plans, the people's material and cultural life and other aspects of reporting. On the afternoon of November 8th, Comrade Liu Zhiming made a summary of the conference and made supplementary explanations on certain issues.

In order to facilitate the concrete implementation of the spirit of this conference in future work, it is also required that various newspapers can achieve the following three points: 1. Formulate a plan to unite all advanced producers, conduct monthly inspections, and absorb experiences; 2. Formulate a typical reporting plan, do a good job of several or several aspects of typical reporting, and truly play the role of guiding the general; 3. Conduct a systematic investigation of the basic situation of grassroots organizations (such as a workshop, an agricultural production cooperative or mutual aid group, a supply and marketing cooperative, etc.) every quarter, and conduct a systematic investigation of reader opinions, check work according to reader opinions, summarize experiences and lessons, educate cadres, and improve cadres. These three specific requirements must be combined with the central work of the Party at that time and in that place, and carried out step by step.

    中共中央东北局宣传部召开省市报纸工作会议
    总结报纸工作迎接大规模经济建设
    东北局宣传部于十月二十七日至十一月八日召开了第三次省、市报纸工作会议，到会的有三十九个单位九十一人，除省、市、工矿报社及青年团省、市团报团刊、东北区主要通俗期刊的负责人外，还有各省、市报社的部分组长及作通讯工作的干部。这次会议从总结经验交流经验入手，讨论了报纸如何更好地为经济建设服务，迎接经济建设的新时期。
    一年来，各报工作都有改进。在经济建设的宣传上，获得不少成绩，这主要表现在宣传了党的发展生产的政策；向离开党的路线、违反党的政策的错误思想和行为，进行了斗争；宣传了劳动人民的智慧和创造；宣传了新的人物、新的思想的成长；报道了人民物质文化生活的不断提高；特别是各报都比较注意推广先进经验的报道，对推动增产节约运动起了一定的作用，密切了报纸与实际的联系。但是这些成绩，比起国家建设事业发展的需要，比起广大人民对报纸的日益增长的要求，显然是作得不够的。各报工作中还有许多缺点，如在报道上的片面性，报道方法、报道形式的老一套，缺乏丰富的群众生活的报道，若干报道失实，以及宣传新的社会制度的优越性不够等等。总结已有的经验，克服现存的缺点，成为报纸工作者迎接国家经济建设新时期所不可缺少的准备工作。
    这次会上，首先听了高岗同志在中国新民主主义青年团东北委员会第三次全体会议上所作的“掌握技术，精通业务，迎接经济建设的新时期”的报告录音，听了张明远同志关于东北区农村工作问题的报告，马洪同志关于东北区工业建设的报告。这些报告都明确地说明了国家建设的光辉前途和我们所面临着的光荣、艰巨的任务，给到会同志以极大的鼓舞和力量。
    会上并邀请了沈阳日报工人通讯员骆海珊和农民通讯员崔芳民作了报告，他们以具体事实生动地说明了广大工农群众对报纸的新的要求，批评了报道的缺点。会上也由松江日报的工人出身的干部邢世良、黑龙江日报的农民出身的干部李贵作了发言，他们都以自己的切身体会，说明了应该如何深入群众、联系群众。这些报告和发言也给到会同志以有益的启示。
    这次会议以大部分时间交流了各报关于经济建设宣传的经验，特别是集中地研究了劳动日报、沈阳日报、黑龙江日报、松江日报、长春新报关于工农业生产、推广生产上的先进经验、基本建设的宣传、思想批判等等报道经验的总结。这次会议所以有可能集中地系统地研究各报的经验，主要是在会前两个月，就由主要的省、市报社开始进行了调查研究，初步总结了经验，作了比较充分的准备，提高了干部思想，为这次会议的总结经验打下了基础。
    十一月七日上午，由东北局宣传部副部长刘芝明同志作了关于“继续贯彻调查研究、通俗化，提高报纸工作的思想水平和业务水平”的报告。刘芝明同志在报告中首先指出：迎接经济建设的新时期，报纸要更好地为经济建设服务，这是一个艰巨的任务。要完成这个任务，就必须把报纸工作提高一步。报纸工作提高一步的关键在那里呢？在于：一、加强经济建设的理论与实际知识的学习；二、加强报纸工作的业务学习，最好的方法是及时地总结经验；三、加强与党委的联系，主动取得党委的领导；加强与群众的广泛的联系，注意反映群众的意见和要求。接着，刘芝明同志集中了各报的经验，加以系统化，提高到思想原则上，作为报纸工作的基本经验。这些基本经验就是：一、依靠党委，主动取得党委的领导，善于体会党委的意图；不仅和党委机关与党委负责同志密切联系；而且要和党所领导的各个部门密切联系；二、广泛地联系群众，进行调查研究，结合当前实际工作，抓住群众中带有普遍性的思想问题，把这个思想问题和党的政策及当前工作中的具体问题结合起来，在报上展开系统的批评与自我批评；三、抓住典型，作样子，用活人活事活道理进行宣传；不仅要善于提出问题，而且要善于解决问题；四、在报道过程中，要把所报道的问题和各部门的组织工作结合起来，使报纸能成为解决实际工作中的思想问题，推动工作前进的有力武器；五、选择群众喜闻乐见的形式，善于运用群众的语言，通俗生动地表达出来。最后，刘芝明同志又根据各报已有的经验，分别就工业生产报道（包括推广先进经验，宣传技术，完成与超过国家计划等）、农业报道、基本建设的报道、思想批判与批评自我批评、继续贯彻通俗化、制订报道计划、人民物质文化生活及其他方面的报道，作了具体的指示。十一月八日下午，由刘芝明同志作了会议的总结，又对某些问题作了补充说明。
    为便于在今后工作中具体贯彻这次会议的精神，还要求各报能作到以下三点：一、订出团结全体先进生产者的计划，逐月进行检查，吸取经验；二、订出典型报道计划，作好几项或几个方面的典型报道，真正发挥指导一般的作用；三、每季度作一次基层组织（如一个车间、一个农业生产合作社或互助组、一个供销合作社等）的基本情况的系统调查，并进行一次读者意见的系统的调查，根据读者意见检查工作，总结经验教训，教育干部，提高干部。这三项具体要求，都必须结合当时当地党的中心工作，有步骤地进行。
