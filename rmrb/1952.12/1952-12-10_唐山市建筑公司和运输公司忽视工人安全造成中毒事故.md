To the Editors:

Recently, during the construction of asphalt roads in Tangshan City, a serious accident occurred involving the poisoning of a large number of workers. We are now informing you of the facts of the incident.

The road construction project officially started on November 12th. The Tangshan Construction Company had little experience in asphalt road construction. They did not properly study the issue of poisoning prevention beforehand, did not adequately prepare anti-poisoning equipment, and did not conduct anti-poisoning education for the workers before starting work. On the same day at noon, three workers developed redness and swelling in their eyes. The company stopped work to investigate, believing that the workers' original glasses were permeable, and that replacing them with airtight, leather-edged glasses would prevent poisoning. That evening, they bought eighty pairs of glasses. They continued work on the 13th. No accidents were discovered that day, so they increased the number of workers involved from one hundred and twenty to three hundred and twenty. On the afternoon of the 15th, more than twenty workers successively experienced facial redness and swelling. The company sent them to the hospital for treatment and temporarily suspended work again, allowing all workers to undergo examination. As a result, among the two hundred and twenty-one workers who had been examined, two hundred were found to be poisoned, fourteen of whom were in serious condition.

The Tangshan Transportation Company did not learn from the poisoning accidents of asphalt carriers in other places. When asking workers to transport asphalt, they only increased the transport price without telling the workers that they were transporting toxic materials. They only prepared some masks and gloves, and no other truly effective anti-poisoning tools. After the poisoning accident of workers at the construction company, they still did not pay attention and only bought some ineffective glasses. It was not until the 15th, when they discovered that some workers were poisoned, that they were sent to the hospital for treatment. Examination proved that all twenty workers transporting asphalt were poisoned; three of them were in very serious condition and were only saved from danger after emergency medical treatment.

We believe that the above-mentioned two companies' neglect of worker safety, resulting in worker poisoning accidents, is extremely serious, especially the style of the Tangshan Transportation Company, which is even more egregious. Now, the relevant units such as the Industry Department of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tangshan Labor Bureau, the People's Procuratorate, the People's Supervision Committee, and the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions have launched an investigation into these two accidents. We hope that the aforementioned units will assign responsibility to the cadres related to these two events and give them appropriate punishment.

    唐山市建筑公司和运输公司忽视工人安全造成中毒事故
    编辑同志：唐山市在最近修建柏油马路工程中，发生了大批工人中毒的严重事故。现在我们把事实经过告诉你们。
    建路工程在十一月十二日正式开工。唐山市建筑公司对修柏油马路的工作没有什么经验。他们事先没有好好研究防毒问题，没有充分准备防毒用具和对工人进行防毒教育，就开始动工了。当天中午，有三个工人眼上发生红肿现象。该公司就停工研究，认为原来工人所带眼镜透气，另换不透气的皮边眼镜就可以防止中毒。当晚，他们买了八十副眼镜。十三日又继续开工了。这一天没有发现事故，他们就把参加工作的工人从一百二十人增加到三百二十人。十五日下午，陆续有二十多个工人发现脸上红肿。该公司就把他们送到医院治疗，并且又暂行停工，让全体工人进行检查。结果，已经被检查的二百二十一个工人中，中毒的有二百人，其中有十四人比较严重。
    唐山市运输公司不接受各地搬运沥青中毒事故的教训，让工人搬运沥青时只把运价提高，而没有告诉工人搬运的是毒性物品。他们只准备了一些口罩和手套，并没有其它真正有效的防毒工具。建筑公司工人中毒事故发生后，他们仍未予以注意，只添买了一些不顶事的眼镜。到十五日，他们发现有的工人中毒，才送到医院治疗。经检查证明：搬运沥青的二十个工人全部中毒；其中有三个人情况很严重，经医生急救才脱离危险。
    我们认为：上述两公司忽视工人安全，造成工人中毒事故的情况是十分严重的，尤其是唐山市运输公司的作风更为恶劣。现在中共唐山市委工业部、唐山市劳动局、人民检察署、人民监察委员会和唐山市总工会等有关单位对这两个事故已经进行调查。希望上述单位对这两个事件有关的干部分别责任，给予适当处分。胡　余　王治发　周焕文子　亮　刘治华
