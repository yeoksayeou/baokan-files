Editor's Note: The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a regional state-owned farm conference from September 8th to 20th this year. Participants included the heads of 29 state-owned farms in the Northeast, political workers from major state-owned farms, financial and technical personnel, cadres from agricultural experiment and research institutions, responsible comrades from the agricultural committees of the CPC provincial committees in the Northeast, heads of agricultural departments of the provincial people's governments, and cadres from relevant departments of the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast People's Government, totaling more than 120 people. The main purpose of this meeting was to solve the operational management problems of state-owned mechanized farms. To prepare for this meeting, ample preparations were made in advance. Some responsible personnel of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government personally led investigation teams to conduct investigations and research in various farms, and under the auspices of the Northeast Bureau, the relevant parties repeatedly held discussions and studies, and drafted a decision to strengthen the work of state-owned farms. At the end of the conference, Lin Feng, First Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, made a summary. The following is the full text of Comrade Lin Feng's summary report.

Comrades:

The state-owned farm conference has come to an end after heated discussions in plenary and small sessions. Based on the decision discussed by the Northeast Bureau, I would like to offer some suggestions as a summary of this conference.

This conference is a meeting of great significance in the development of state-owned farms, and it is also a successful meeting. Through this conference, everyone has clarified the nature and tasks of state-owned farms and effectively solved some of the existing problems in the farms. All the comrades who spoke made criticisms and self-criticisms, reviewed the errors and shortcomings in the past work of the farms, and resolved to correct these errors and shortcomings. They have a high degree of confidence in running the state-owned farms well. Many comrades said, "We will definitely run the farms well when we go back." "Running the state-owned farms well is to struggle for communism." Therefore, after this conference, the work of state-owned farms will be greatly improved. An important reason for the success of this conference, in addition to the efforts of all the comrades, is that the Northeast Bureau conducted nearly half a year of investigation and research before the conference and made relatively full preparations. After discussion at the conference, everyone unanimously agreed with the Northeast Bureau's decision on strengthening the work of state-owned farms, and I hope that everyone will earnestly implement this decision after returning and mobilize all employees to strive to run our state-owned farms well.

Below, I would like to offer some suggestions on several issues. These suggestions mainly concern state-owned mechanized farms.

I. Basic Situation of State-Owned Farms in the Northeast Region

The preparation of state-owned farms in the Northeast region began in the autumn of 1947, and construction began in 1948. In order to accumulate production experience in mechanized agriculture, educate farmers, and train cadres, the Party selected cadres, invested considerable funds, and purchased machinery under difficult conditions at that time to create this new type of enterprise. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the efforts of all employees and cadres, and the assistance from the Soviet Union in various aspects, this new type of enterprise of state-owned farms has taken initial shape in the past five years. At present, there are 545 state-owned farms in the Northeast, with a cultivated area of 189,000 hectares (more than 80,000 hectares of which are mechanized farms – each hectare is equivalent to 15 mu), and 43,000 employees (more than 20,000 of whom are mechanized farm employees). There has also been a certain amount of basic construction: there are currently 595 tractors, 252 combines, 152 automobiles, 25,000 head of draught animals, 5,000 carts, more than 18,000 sets of various farm implements, more than 5,000 head of cattle (including 2,400 dairy cows), 29,000 sheep, 1,500 deer, and a large number of livestock and poultry, etc. Among the 545 state-owned farms, there are 29 mechanized farms, 38 experimental farms, 169 county demonstration farms, and 309 county production farms. According to the types of operation, there are 449 grain farms, 28 livestock farms, 37 horticultural farms, and 31 specialty farms (including 10 cotton farms, 5 kenaf farms, 6 tussah silkworm farms, 2 tobacco farms, 1 sugar beet farm, and 7 others). Some of these state-owned farms were established with direct investment from the state, some were established by government agencies for production, and some were established by the military and disabled veterans. These farms are scattered throughout the vast Northeast region. All cities and counties in the region, except for 12, have state-owned farms. These state-owned farms are socialist agriculture, are the valuable wealth of the people, and will play an important role in the future development of agriculture.

Over the past few years, state-owned mechanized farms have trained a certain number of agricultural machinery technicians, which not only met the needs of the farms themselves, but also partially supported national defense and other economic sectors; accumulated some experience in agricultural technology, mechanical technology, and operation management; farm cadres have begun to explore some of the laws of running mechanized farms; the farming methods and farming techniques of the farms have gradually improved; some commodity grain has been produced for the state; some farms have begun to be profitable; and a certain positive impact has been generated among the masses of farmers, playing a certain demonstration role and promoting cooperation and mutual assistance to a certain extent. Under the leadership and education of the Party, the consciousness of farm workers has been continuously improved, and the work of the farms has gradually progressed. This year, the average yield of spring wheat per hectare of ten state-owned mechanized farms reached 1.1 tons. The "93" farm achieved a high yield of 2.2 tons per hectare of spring wheat on a large area of 400 hectares. All these achievements are the result of the hard work of all farm workers under the leadership of the Party.

However, state-owned mechanized farms have also had some relatively serious shortcomings over the past few years. They have not yet shown the superiority of mechanized socialist agricultural enterprises, nor have they played the role of an advanced banner in agriculture.

The main shortcomings of state-owned mechanized farms are manifested in: low yields, large waste, resulting in high costs and unprofitable operation. Some of the reasons for these shortcomings are due to lack of experience, and some shortcomings and errors were unavoidable at the beginning, and some were caused by irresistible natural disasters. But the most important reason is poor operation and management. The operation and management have not adapted to the characteristics of large-scale mechanized agricultural production, and some leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the importance of state-owned farms, lack the idea of relying on all employees to run the farms well, and lack the spirit of delving into business in depth. No cropping system and cultivation methods suitable for mechanical technical crops have been established, the potential of agricultural machinery has not been fully utilized, and agricultural machinery technology and agricultural scientific and technical levels have not been seriously mastered and improved.

Our state-owned farms have achievements and shortcomings. We cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements, because these achievements are insignificant compared with our cause; we must face up to our shortcomings, although these shortcomings are serious, but I believe that we can completely overcome them. Find out the shortcomings, overcome the shortcomings, and our cause will continue to move forward.

II. Tasks of State-Owned Farms

State-owned farms are state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature. They are an advanced banner in agriculture. Their basic task is to demonstrate to farmers the superiority of mechanized production in order to attract farmers to gradually move towards collectivization; to accumulate experience in agricultural mechanical technology, agricultural scientific technology, and operation management; to train cadres; and to prepare conditions for future agricultural mechanization and collectivization; and at the same time, to produce commodity grain, industrial raw materials, and livestock products for the state to meet the needs of industrial construction.

At present, the specific task of all employees of state-owned farms is to run the existing farms well and strive to strengthen operation management, improve agricultural mechanical technology level and agricultural scientific technology level, and increase output, eliminate waste, and reduce costs.

Producing more grain is the main yardstick for measuring state-owned farms. High yield is the concentrated expression of the superiority of state-owned farms. Therefore, all employees of state-owned farms must concentrate their efforts to increase production, produce more grain, and increase the breeding rate of livestock and livestock products.

In 1953, state-owned farms must further demonstrate the superiority of mechanized production in increasing production, requiring the average yield of wheat per hectare to reach at least 1.3 tons (some farms should reach 1.5 tons), the average yield of soybeans per hectare to reach at least 1.4 tons, and the average yield of rice per hectare to reach at least 3 tons. And immediately take all measures to reduce costs, plug loopholes, and eliminate all kinds of losses and waste.

In order to run the existing state-owned farms well, it is necessary to thoroughly rectify the existing farms:

Regarding the rectification of land: In order to adapt to the requirements of mechanized operation, land that is scattered but has the conditions to be connected into one piece should be connected into one piece, and obstacles in the land should be removed; land that is too scattered to be connected into one piece and is not suitable for mechanized operation can be replaced with new-style horse-drawn farm implements, or handed over to agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid groups for use according to the actual situation. Land that is intertwined between farms and is beneficial to merge should be merged (farm mergers should be studied and proposed by the agricultural departments of the Northeast People's Government and the provinces, and reported to the Northeast People's Government for approval), or land adjustments should be carried out. The interspersed land of farmers in the farms should be mobilized to properly exchange, but the exchange should be obtained with the farmers' willingness, and the farmers must not be made to suffer. Farms that adopt the method of dividing and planting with farmers should be resolutely changed.

State-owned farms in various counties should all use new-style horse-drawn farm implements. The adjustment of land should be investigated by the provinces to determine the rectification plan. The main task is to do a good job of demonstration and promote agricultural technology.

The water conservancy construction of the four major irrigation areas should be subject to the requirements of paddy field operation.

After the farms carry out land adjustment, they should be immediately zoned and stereotyped, and a cultivation area should be effectively established.

Regarding the rectification of machinery: In order to give full play to the efficiency of the machinery, the existing machinery must be properly adjusted according to the amount of land operated by the farms. All machinery that is surplus to the farms should be turned over to the state-owned farm administration for unified allocation. Agricultural machinery must establish a maintenance, storage, and repair system, and a quota system should be effectively implemented.

Regarding the adjustment of personnel: Non-production personnel must be reduced, management expenses must be reduced, and personnel who are not suitable for farm work should be properly placed. Farm personnel should effectively implement a fixed number of personnel and rationalize the labor organization in order to effectively improve labor productivity.

After the adjustment of land, machinery, and personnel, efforts should be concentrated to increase output, effectively implement the economic accounting system, and establish various necessary systems.

In order to run the state-owned farms well and do a good job of rectification, in addition to the farm leading organs making full preparations, the main key lies in fully developing democracy, mobilizing all employees, and turning the Northeast Bureau's decision to strengthen the work of state-owned farms into conscious action by the masses. After the autumn harvest, it is necessary to earnestly mobilize the masses to inspect the work. Farms that have carried out the "Three-Anti" movement should be combined with ideological construction, democratic make-up lessons, and party rectification; farms that have not carried out the "Three-Anti" movement should be combined with party rectification and inspection work. In the movement, preparations for next year's major production must be made well. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Northeast People's Government and the agricultural departments of the provinces should regard the work of rectifying farms as one of the key tasks this winter. The Ministry of Agriculture should hold various necessary special meetings this winter to specifically implement the Northeast Bureau's decision to strengthen the work of state-owned farms. The provincial committees should discuss the situation of state-owned farms in their provinces and effectively inspect and deploy the work of the farms next year.

On the basis of running the existing farms well, new farms should be actively and steadily established. The Northeast People's Economic Planning Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the provincial committees, and the agricultural departments of the provincial people's governments should effectively propose specific development plans. According to past experience, new farms must be effectively surveyed and designed, and a construction plan must be proposed, and establishment is only allowed after approval. At the same time, leading cadres with a high degree of dedication to the farm should be selected, and the necessary agricultural mechanical technicians, farm scientific and technical personnel, and operation management personnel should be equipped. Various regions should establish different types of farms according to natural conditions and needs. Vegetable farms can be considered near cities to ensure the supply of vegetables to the cities.

In order to adapt to the development of state-owned farms, the agricultural departments and personnel departments should equip and train the cadres needed by the farms.

In order to run the state-owned farms well, the relevant departments must assist and provide the necessary material guarantees:

Regarding agricultural investment: The financial departments must guarantee the needs of the farm production funds according to the investment plan, must invest in accordance with the characteristics of mechanized agricultural production, and should also assist and equip the financial accounting personnel of state-owned farms to assist the farms in establishing financial accounting systems. All processed products of farms for self-sufficiency and employee welfare should be exempted from taxation.

Regarding basic construction: In order to meet the needs of farm production, necessary basic construction must be carried out. At present, the farms should build necessary employee dormitories, warehouses, roads, bridges, etc. The basic construction materials needed by the farms should be allocated by the materials distribution departments in a timely manner.

Regarding the supply of farm production materials: Plans should be submitted on time, and contracts should be signed with industrial trade and other departments respectively. Industrial trade and other departments should promptly guarantee the needs of state-owned farms in accordance with the contracts signed with state-owned farms. For materials that are uniformly distributed by the state, the material supply distribution departments should stipulate specific allocation prices.

Regarding the disposal of farm products: All products of state-owned farms are uniformly submitted to the state trade organs for promotion. The state trade departments and grain departments should sign contracts with the farms. The farms should guarantee the quality of the products, and the trade departments must not suppress grades and prices.

Regarding transportation issues: The Northeast People's Economic Planning Commission and the railway departments should include farm transportation in the plan, and the highway departments should provide convenience to the farms in transportation. During the harvest season, they should assist the farms in allocating automobiles to ensure the completion of the farm transportation tasks. Roads built and used by the farms themselves should be exempt from road maintenance fees.

Regarding welfare facilities: State-owned farms should establish medical institutions and primary schools, and gradually prepare to set up nurseries according to needs. These construction costs should be proposed by the competent authorities and included in the national budget.

III. On Operation Management Issues

The operation management work of state-owned farms must adapt to the characteristics of large-scale mechanized production, establish the idea of relying on all employees to run the farms well, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, must earnestly implement the economic accounting system, give full play to the efficiency of agricultural machinery, and improve labor productivity, in order to effectively increase output, eliminate waste, and reduce costs.

In order to implement the economic accounting system, it is necessary to overcome the idea of the supply system, it is necessary to be careful and economical, eliminate waste, and reduce unnecessary expenses. The most important issue in implementing the economic accounting system at present is to effectively implement quota management. It is necessary to implement personnel quotas, production quotas, work quotas, and consumption quotas, etc., and implement an excess reward system on the basis of quota management.

In 1953, on the premise of ensuring cultivation quality, each medium-sized tractor should cultivate 220 to 250 hectares of land, and each person on a mechanized farm should cultivate an average of 15 hectares; each set of horse-drawn farm implements should cultivate 80 hectares; workers in farms using horse-drawn farm implements should cultivate an average of 8 hectares per person; and the consumption of oil should be reduced as much as possible. This quota should be gradually revised and gradually increased according to the improvement of production.

In 1953, the cost per hectare should be reduced by 20 to 30 percent compared to this year.

In order to eliminate waste, it is necessary to establish a responsibility system and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible. It is necessary to establish and improve operating areas and cultivation teams, effectively and strictly organize labor, and fix personnel, machines, and land to implement a system of contracting vehicles, contracting land, and contracting output.

State-owned farms must implement strict planning in operation management, and must formulate practical production plans. Production plans must be launched to all employees for discussion, and production plans must be transformed into the plans of all employees themselves. All major issues of the farms must be discussed by the farm management committee.

State-owned farms must establish and improve financial and accounting systems, and must conduct asset inventory and fund assessment uniformly this winter, effectively clean up past accounts, and effectively separate fixed assets and current assets.

In order to increase the income of farms and make full use of farm by-products, diversified operations can be implemented step by step and in a planned manner according to conditions and needs. At present, the most important thing in operation is the combination of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. The grain and vegetables needed by the farms themselves should be produced in a planned manner in order to achieve self-sufficiency. At the same time, some necessary agricultural product processing industries can be run.

In order to solve the welfare problems of farm workers, all welfare undertakings that are possible and urgently needed at present must be started immediately. State-owned farms should establish a farm director fund system.

IV. Mastering and Improving Mechanical Technology and Agricultural Scientific Technology

In order to run state-owned farms well and fully demonstrate the superiority of mechanized production, it is necessary to give full play to the role of mechanical technology and agricultural science, mechanical technology and agricultural science must be combined, and mechanical technology and agricultural science must serve the stable increase of output.

In terms of mechanical technology, operations must be carried out in accordance with operating procedures, and no extensive operation is allowed. Mechanical technology must meet the requirements of agricultural science. Therefore, mechanical technicians must be proficient in mechanical technology on the one hand, improve their technical level, implement connected operations, and give full play to the potential of machinery. At the same time, they must study agricultural science and serve agricultural production well. It is necessary to cherish and value agricultural machinery like soldiers cherishing their weapons, and conscientiously implement the maintenance and repair system. Model mechanical technicians who are proficient in mechanical technology, have made contributions to mechanical technology, and serve agricultural production well, cherish machinery, and extend the life of machinery should be commended and rewarded in a timely manner. All of these should become a system. In order to protect the machinery, necessary warehouses should be gradually built, and all machinery should be oiled as needed. In order to meet the needs of machine repair, each mechanical farm should establish a repair shop. The State-Owned Farm Administration should establish three central repair shops in appropriate areas of northern Manchuria to undertake major repair tasks, and establish a repair and parts factory to manufacture machine parts. In order to uniformly supply machinery, oil, machine parts, etc. to mechanical farms in the entire Northeast region, the Ministry of Agriculture should establish a corporate supply station.

In terms of agricultural technology, state-owned farms must continuously improve agricultural technology, and must show their superiority in agricultural technology. Agricultural scientific technology must be well combined with agricultural practice. Farms should study and improve agricultural technology well. Agricultural scientific research and experimental institutions and agricultural schools have the responsibility to help farms solve problems in agricultural science and technology, and regularly send people to farms to do research work and internships, so that research work and agricultural production are combined, and the learning of schools is combined with agricultural practice.

At present, deep plowing, flat sowing, close planting, autumn plowing, and opening up wasteland must be stipulated as a system in agricultural cultivation technology, and the work of land preparation must be carried out well. Each mechanical farm should implement a crop rotation system according to conditions and trial pasture rotation in order to cultivate land fertility, eliminate weeds, and stably increase output.

All state-owned grain farms should completely use excellent varieties within two or three years. Therefore, attention must be paid to seed selection and breeding work. State-owned farms should set up experimental areas and seed collection fields to cultivate seeds, first of all, to cultivate local excellent varieties. Soils must be researched and analyzed in order to actively and reasonably fertilize. Natural conditions such as climate, rainfall, and frost period must be studied to sow in time, weed in time, and harvest in time, and it must be effectively ensured that agricultural time is not missed. Attention should be paid to preventing and eliminating diseases and insect pests, and preventive measures should be taken with a positive attitude to fight against natural disasters and strive for high yield and bumper harvest.

Political and ideological education must be carried out for mechanical and agricultural technicians to improve their awareness and make them actively serve agricultural production.

V. Tasks in Political Work

State-owned farms are socialist enterprises, and farm workers are the masters. State-owned farms must establish strong political work with high prestige. All farm cadres must establish the idea of relying on all employees to run the farms well. The basic task of farm political work is to continuously educate and mobilize all employees to improve their class consciousness and give full play to their high labor enthusiasm and creativity, and fight with the attitude of masters to complete and exceed the state's production plan. This winter, the work of party rectification, inspection, ideological construction, and democratic make-up lessons (the "Three-Anti" movement should be carried out for those who have not carried out the "Three-Anti" movement) should be combined with the winter work to develop democracy, mobilize all employees, form a broad and in-depth mass movement, thoroughly rectify the farms, and strive to increase output, eliminate waste, reduce costs, and prepare for next year's major production. The farm party committees must regularly educate party members to play an active leading role in all work, and effectively enrich the work of trade unions and the Communist Youth League. It is necessary to establish a firm concept of cherishing state property among all employees. The Party should constantly pay attention to improving the political, cultural, and technical level of workers, and carry out literacy movements in conjunction with winter work, and promote the quick literacy method.

On the basis of the improvement of the political consciousness of the workers through mass movements, and in accordance with the Party Constitution and the standards of party members, the activists in the movement should be absorbed into the Party in a planned manner to strengthen the Party's strength in the farms. It should be fully recognized that if the farm does not have a strong Party branch and does not have a certain number of party members playing a backbone and core role in the farm, the farm work will be difficult to do well.

In order to strengthen the political work of the farms, a full-time deputy director should be set up for political work. Trade unions and the Communist Youth League should have full-time cadres. The party work and political work of the farms are led by the local county party committee and the provincial party committee. Farm directors or deputy directors who are qualified to participate in the county party committee can participate in the county party committee. In order to strengthen the trade union work of state-owned farms, industry trade unions should be prepared to be established. The trade unions of the farms should regularly organize and launch labor competitions, carry out rationalization proposals, promote advanced experience, and make the labor enthusiasm of the workers always full. Finally, all farms must do a good job in the welfare work of the workers on the basis of doing a good job in production.

VI. On Leadership and Style Issues

To run the farms well, the Party and government leading organs must attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of the farm work. The great economic and political significance of state-owned farms must be recognized. State-owned farms are state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature that transform small-scale peasant economy and attract the vast number of peasants to the road of collectivization and mechanization. They will play a backbone role in agricultural collectivization and mechanization. Comrade Stalin said: "The Soviet farm continues to advance, it is the main backbone of transforming the old system in the countryside. Many collective farms continue to advance, it is the main backbone of transforming the old system in the countryside. Many collective farms are like the base of new movements in the countryside, and they advance behind the Soviet farms. The unified work of these two systems created the conditions for the complete collectivization of the Soviet states." Comrade Stalin also said: "In fact, the Soviet farm and its new technology, its unprecedented economic scale to help nearby farmers, is a guiding force that can promote the transformation of farmers and promote farmers to the road of collectivization." Therefore, failure to attach importance to the work of state-owned farms and insufficient understanding of the importance of state-owned farms will commit serious mistakes. We must strengthen state-owned farms and must run state-owned farms well. Party and government leading organs at all levels must regard leading state-owned farms and running state-owned farms well as their important tasks. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the work of state-owned farms, especially the agricultural departments paid very poor attention. This must be corrected in the future.

We must cherish the existing more than 500 farms and run them well in order to educate farmers, train cadres, gain experience, and prepare conditions for agricultural collectivization.

In order to strengthen the leadership of state-owned farms, the agricultural committees of the Northeast Bureau and the provincial committees must have full-time cadres to study the farm work. The agricultural departments of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Liaoxi provinces should set up a state-owned farm administration, and the agricultural departments of Jilin, Liaodong, and Rehe provinces should set up a state-owned farm management office, and the farm work should be managed by a deputy director. The provincial party committees and governments should regularly inspect and discuss the work of the farms, help the farms summarize experience, solve problems, and help the farm comrades improve their work and leadership level.

The daily administrative and business of the state-owned farms led by the county can be uniformly transferred to the agricultural section for management. The county party committee and the county people's government must attach great importance to the leadership of the state-owned farms.

All leading cadres of the farms must recognize the importance of their positions. They should understand that the Party gives us this important cause of state-owned farms is glorious and the responsibility is great. Therefore, we must bury our heads, establish a strong sense of professionalism and a high sense of responsibility, be diligent and conscientious, overcome difficulties, go deep into reality, and rely on the workers to complete their tasks well.

An important condition for doing a good job in the farm work is to study and delve into. Chairman Mao often taught us that things that we do not know can be learned as long as we study. Farm work is a new cause, and it is impossible not to study. We must learn from workers, learn from technicians, learn from local farmers, and learn from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has very rich experience in mechanized agricultural operation management, agricultural science, and mechanical technology. We must combine our actual situation and study well. If we study well, we can avoid many detours.

All cadres of farm leading departments must develop a work style of going deep into reality and contacting the masses. Farm cadres should often go to the farms, to the operating areas, to the production teams, and to the fields to study and solve problems. It is necessary to cultivate model operating areas, model production teams, summarize their experience, and use them to guide the general. We must often pay attention to new things and new experiences, summarize and promote the experience and creation of workers. Use these methods to improve the work of the farms and improve the leadership level of the farms. We must have such a work style and learn such work methods. Many of our comrades have initially learned some knowledge of mechanized production, but we must not be complacent. We should make further efforts.

In order to exchange the experience of the farms, the local party newspapers should appropriately introduce the activities of the state-owned farms and introduce the experience of the Soviet Union. The State-Owned Farm Administration can publish irregular publications according to its strength.

In order to help the farms establish various systems and enable the farms to quickly embark on the road of enterprise standardization and normalization, the State-Owned Farm Administration should formulate some necessary regulations in accordance with the decision of the Northeast Bureau in order to quickly improve our work.

The autumn harvest has arrived. The most central work at present is to do a good job in the autumn harvest. We must immediately implement the spirit of this meeting into the autumn harvest work to ensure a high yield and bumper harvest.

Comrades! We communists always look forward and never satisfy the existing achievements, because these achievements are still very small compared with our great communist cause and the great future of our farm cause. We never conceal the shortcomings in our work and are not afraid to expose the shortcomings in our work, because our shortcomings are the shortcomings in the course of progress. As long as we dare to self-criticize and dare to correct our shortcomings, our cause will continue to move forward rapidly.

Comrades! It has been three years since the victory of the Chinese revolution on a national scale. In the past three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have achieved great victories on all fronts. The people's democratic dictatorship has become increasingly consolidated, and economic construction has been restored and exceeded the highest pre-war level. This is a historic and great victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We are about to start large-scale economic construction. Our farms should be well prepared. Next year, our farms will take a big step forward and will greatly show the superiority of mechanized production in terms of output. Let us work together and let us run the state-owned farms with full confidence and strive to welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction!

    迎接大规模经济建设，办好国营农场
    ——林枫同志在中共中央东北局召开的国营农场会议上的总结报告
    编者按：中共中央东北局于今年九月八日到二十日召开了全区国营农场会议。参加会议的有东北二十九个国营农场场长，主要国营农场的政治工作人员，财务、技术人员，以及农业试验、研究机关的干部，东北区中共各省委农委负责同志，各省人民政府农业厅长，以及东北局、东北人民政府各有关部门的干部共一百二十余人。这次会议的主要目的是解决国营机械农场的经营管理问题。为了开好这次会议，事先作了充分准备。中共中央东北局、东北人民政府的一些负责人员，曾亲自带领调查组到各农场进行调查研究，并在东北局主持下，由各有关方面反复座谈研究，草拟了加强国营农场工作的决定。大会最后由东北局第一副书记林枫同志作了总结。下面是林枫同志的总结报告全文。同志们：
    国营农场会议经过了大会小会热烈的讨论，现在就要结束了，我根据东北局讨论的决定提出一些意见，作为这次会议的总结。
    这次会议是国营农场发展道路上有重要意义的会议，也是个成功的会议。经过这次会议，大家明确了国营农场的性质和任务，并切实解决了农场存在的一些问题。所有发言的同志都进行了批评与自我批评，检讨了过去农场工作中的错误和缺点，并决心改正这些错误和缺点，对办好国营农场有了高度的信心，许多同志说：“回去一定把农场办好。”“办好国营农场就是为共产主义而奋斗。”因此，经过这次会议后，国营农场的工作将大大地提高。这次会议开的成功的一个重要原因，除全体同志们的努力外，是东北局在会前进行了将近半年的调查研究，作了比较充分的准备工作。经过会议讨论，大家一致同意东北局关于加强国营农场工作的决定，希望大家回去之后，认真地贯彻执行这一决定，发动全体职工为办好我们的国营农场而奋斗。
    下边我想分几个问题提出一些意见，这些意见主要是关于国营机械农场方面的。一、东北区国营农场的基本
    情况
    东北地区国营农场是在一九四七年秋天开始筹备，一九四八年开始建场的。党为了积累机械化农业的生产经验，教育农民，培养干部，在当时困难的条件下选派了干部，投入了相当资金，购买了机器，创办这一新型事业。由于党的正确领导，全体职工和干部的努力，以及苏联在各方面给我们的帮助，五年来国营农场这一新型事业已经初具规模。现在东北国营农场共有五百四十五个，耕地面积达十八万九千垧（其中机械农场八万余垧——每垧合十五市亩），职工四万三千人（其中机械农场职工两万余人）。并有了一定的基本建设：现有拖拉机五百九十五台，康拜因二百五十二台，汽车一百五十二台，役畜二万五千头，大车五千台，各种农具一万八千余台，牛五千余头（内乳牛二千四百余头），羊二万九千余只，鹿一千五百只，此外还有大量的家畜家禽等等。在五百四十五个国营农场中，有机械化农场二十九个，试验农场三十八个，县示范农场一百六十九个，县生产农场三百零九个。按经营种类分，计谷物农场四百四十九个，畜牧场二十八个，园艺农场三十七个，特产农场三十一个（其中棉花农场十个、洋麻农场五个、柞蚕农场六个、烟农场二个、甜菜农场一个，其他七个）。这些国营农场的建立，有的是国家直接投资办的，有的是机关生产办的，有的是部队和荣誉军人办的。这些农场散布在东北广大地区。全区除十二个市、县外，其他市、县都有国营农场了。这些国营农场是社会主义性质的农业，是人民宝贵的财富，在今后农业发展过程中它将起着重要的作用。
    几年来，国营机械农场培养了一定数量的农业机械技术人员，不仅供给了农场本身的需要，而且部分地支援了国防及其他经济部门；积累了一些农业技术、机械技术和经营管理方面的经验，农场干部已开始摸索到了一些办机械农场的规律，农场的耕作方法与耕作技术逐渐有了进步，为国家生产了一些商品粮食，有的农场已开始有利，并在农民群众中发生了一定的积极影响，起了一定的示范作用，对合作互助起了一定的推动作用。农场职工在党的领导和教育下觉悟不断提高，农场工作逐渐有了进步。今年十个国营机械农场的每垧春麦平均产量达到了一吨一。“九三”农场在四百垧大片土地上每垧春麦达到了二吨二的高额产量。所有这些成绩，都是农场全体职工在党的领导下艰苦奋斗的结果。
    但是，几年以来国营机械农场还存在着一些比较严重的缺点，还没有在生产上显示出机械化的社会主义农业企业的优越性，还没有在农业中起到先进旗帜的作用。
    国营机械农场存在的主要缺点表现在：产量较低，浪费很大，因而形成成本过高，经营不利。发生这些缺点的原因有的是由于缺乏经验，有些缺点和错误在开始时是难以避免的，也有的是由于不可抗拒的自然灾害造成的，但是最主要的原因还是由于经营管理不善，在经营管理上没有适应大规模机械化农业生产的特点，以及某些领导干部对国营农场的重要性认识不足，缺乏依靠全体职工办好农场的思想和深入实际钻研业务的精神。没有建立适应机械技术作物的耕作制度和耕作方法，没有充分发挥农业机器的潜在力，没有认真地掌握和提高农业机械技术和农业科学技术水平。
    我们国营农场有成绩也有缺点，我们不能满足已有成绩，因为这些成绩同我们的事业比较起来是微不足道的；我们必须正视我们的缺点，虽然这些缺点是严重的，但我相信我们是完全可以克服的，找出缺点，克服缺点，我们的事业就会不断地前进。
    二、国营农场的任务
    国营农场是社会主义性质的国家企业，它是农业中的先进旗帜，它的基本任务是以机械化生产的优越性向农民示范，借以吸引农民逐渐走向集体化；积累农业机械技术、农业科学技术和经营管理的经验，培养干部，为将来农业机械化集体化准备条件；同时为国家生产商品粮食、工业原料及畜产品，以适应工业建设的需要。
    目前国营农场全体职工的具体任务就是要把现有农场办好，为加强经营管理，提高农业机械技术水平和农业科学技术水平，为提高产量、消灭浪费、降低成本而奋斗。
    多打粮食是测量国营农场主要尺度，产量高是国营农场优越性的集中表现。因此，今后国营农场全体职工必须集中全力提高产量多打粮食，增加牲畜的增殖率和畜产品。
    国营农场一九五三年在提高产量方面必须进一步显示机械化生产的优越性，要求小麦每垧平均产量最低达到一吨三（有的农场应达到一吨半），大豆每垧平均最低达到一吨四，水稻每垧平均最低达到三吨。并立即采取一切措施，降低成本，堵塞漏洞，消灭各种损失浪费现象。
    为了把现有国营农场办好，必须切实地对现有农场进行整顿：
    关于土地的整顿：为了适应机械化作业的要求，凡土地分散，而又有条件联成一片的应将土地联成
    一片，要去掉地中的障碍物；土地过于分散实在不能联成一片，不适于机械作业的可改用新式马拉农具，或根据实际情况交给农业生产合作社或互助组使用。农场与农场间土地犬牙交错合并有益的应予合并（农场合并应由东北人民政府农业部门与各省研究提出合并方案，报东北人民政府批准），或进行土地调整。农民在农场里的插花土地应动员农民适当调换，但调换时应取得农民的自愿，决不能使农民吃亏。凡采取与农民分种的农场，应坚决改变。
    各县国营农场应一律改用新式马拉农具，对土地的调整，由各省进行调查，确定整顿方案。其主要任务是作好示范，作好农业技术的推广工作。
    四大灌区的水利建设要服从水田经营的要求。
    农场在进行土地调整后，应即加以区划定型，切实建立耕作区。
    关于机器的整顿：为了发挥机器的效能，必须把现有机器按照农场经营土地多少适当调整，凡农场多余的机器应一律上缴，由国营农场管理局统一调配。农业机器必须建立保养保管检修制度，并应切实实行定额制。
    关于人员的调整：非生产人员必须减少，管理费
    用必须降低，凡不适于农场工作的人员应适当安置。农场人员应切实实行定员，并使劳动组织合理化，以便切实提高劳动生产率。
    在土地、机器、人员进行调整以后，应集中力量提高产量，切实贯彻经济核算制，建立各种必要制度。
    为了把国营农场办好，把整顿工作作好，除农场领导机关应作充分准备外，主要的关键是在于充分的发扬民主，把全体职工发动起来，把东北局加强国营农场工作的决定，变成群众自觉的行动。在秋收以后，必须认真地发动群众检查工作。已经进行了“三反”运动的农场，要与思想建设、民主补课和整党结合进行；尚未进行“三反”运动的农场，要与整党检查工作结合进行，在运动中要把明年大生产的准备工作作好。东北人民政府农业部、各省农业厅应将整顿农场工作当作今冬工作的重点之一。农业部应在今年冬季召开各种必要的专门会议，具体贯彻东北局加强国营农场工作的决定，各省委应就本省国营农场的情况进行讨论，切实检查和布置农场明年的工作。
    在办好现有农场的基础上，要积极地稳步地建立新的农场。东北人民经济计划委员会、农业部、各省委、省人民政府农业厅应切实提出具体发展方案。根据过去的经验，新建农场必须切实经过勘察设计，提出建场计划，经过批准方准建立，同时要选派对农场有高度事业心的领导干部，配备必要的农业机械技术人员、农场科学技术人员和经营管理人员。各个地区应根据自然条件和需要建立不同类型的农场，城市附近可考虑建立蔬菜农场，保证城市蔬菜供应。
    为了适应国营农场的发展，农业部门与人事部门应配备和培养农场所需要的干部。
    为了把国营农场办好，各有关部门必须予以协助并予以必要的物质保证：
    关于农业投资方面：财政部门必须按照投资计划保障农场生产资金的需要，必须适应机械化农业生产的特点进行投资，同时应协助和配备国营农场的财务会计人员，协助农场建立财务会计制度。凡农场为了自给和职工生活福利的加工产品，应免予课税。
    关于基本建设方面：为了适应农场生产的需要，必须进行必要的基本建设。目前农场应修建必要的职工宿舍、仓库、道路、桥梁等。农场需要的基本建设材料，物资分配部门应及时调拨。
    关于农场的生产资料供应问题：应按时提出计划，分别与工业贸易等部门签订合同，工业贸易等部门应按照与国营农场签订的合同，及时保证国营农场的需要。属于国家统一分配之物资，供应物资分配部门应规定特定的调拨价格。
    关于农场产品的处理：国营农场的一切产品统交国家贸易机关推销，国家贸易部门、粮食部门应与农场订立合同，农场在产品方面应保证质量，贸易部门不得压等压价。
    关于运输问题：东北人民经济计划委员会与铁路部门应将农场运输纳入计划，公路部门应在运输上给农场以便利，在收获季节应协助农场调配汽车，保证农场运输任务的完成。农场自修自用的公路，应免纳养路费。
    关于福利设施方面：国营农场应设立医疗机关和小学校，并根据需要逐步筹办托儿所。这些建设费用由主管部门提出，列入国家预算。
    三、关于经营管理问题
    国营农场的经营管理工作必须适应机械化大规模生产的特点，树立依靠全体职工办好农场的思想，充分发挥职工的积极性和创造性，必须认真地贯彻经济核算制，充分发挥农业机械的效能，提高劳动生产率，以便切实地做到提高产量，消灭浪费，降低成本。
    为了贯彻经济核算制，必须克服供给制的思想，必须精打细算，消灭浪费，减少不必要的开支。在贯彻经济核算制中目前最重要的问题是切实实行定额管理，要实行人员定额、生产定额、工作定额和消耗定额等等，在定额管理的基础上实行超额奖励制。
    在一九五三年，在保证耕作质量的前提下，每台中型的拖拉机应当耕种二百二十垧到二百五十垧土地，机械农场每一个人应当平均种地十五垧；每一套马拉农具应种地八十垧；使用马拉农具农场的工人，每人平均应种地八垧；油料的消耗应尽量降低。这个定额应根据生产的提高逐渐修正，逐渐提高。
    在一九五三年每垧成本要比今年降低百分之二十到三十。
    为了消灭浪费，必须建立责任制度，消灭无人负责的现象。要建立与健全作业区和耕作队，切实严密劳动组织，把人员机器和土地固定起来，实行包车包地包产量制度。
    国营农场在经营管理上必须实行严格的计划性，必须制定切实的生产计划，生产计划必须发动全体职工进行讨论，把生产计划变成为全体职工自己的计划，农场的一切重大问题必须经过农场管理委员会进行讨论。
    国营农场必须建立与健全财务和会计制度，在今年冬季一律进行清理资产核定资金，把过去的账目切实进行清理，把固定资金和流动资金切实分开。
    为了增加农场的收入，充分利用农场的副产物，可根据条件和需要，有步骤、有计划地实行多样性的经营。目前在经营上最主要的是农、牧、林结合，农场自己所需要的粮食和蔬菜应有计划的生产，以便达到自给，同时可举办某些必要的农产品加工业。
    为了解决农场的职工福利问题，目前凡可能和急需举办的福利事业，必须立即举办。国营农场应建立场长基金制度。
    四、掌握与提高机械技术与农业科学技术
    为了办好国营农场，充分显示机械化生产的优越性，必须充分发挥机械技术与农业科学的作用，必须使机械技术与农业科学结合起来，机械技术与农业科学必须为稳定的提高产量而服务。
    在机械技术方面，必须按操作规程作业，不准粗放经营，机械技术必须合乎农业科学的要求。因此，机械技术人员必须一方精通机械技术，提高技术水平，实行连接作业，充分发挥机械的潜在力。同时要学习农业科学，很好的为农业生产服务。必须爱护与珍贵农业机器，像战士爱护他们的武器一样，认真地执行保养和检修制度。机器检修必须适应农时，要提前做好检修工作，检修后必须经过试车。对于精通机械技术，在机械技术上有贡献并很好地为农业生产服务，爱护机器延长机器寿命的模范机械技术人员应及时给以表扬奖励。所有这些，都应成为制度。为了保护机器应逐渐修建必要的仓库，所有机器应按照需要进行涂油。为了机器检修的需要，每个机械农场要建立修理厂，国营农场管理局应在北满适当地区分别建立三个中心修理厂，担任大修任务，并建立一个修配厂制造机器零件。为了统一供应东北全区的机械农场机器、油料、机器零件等，农业部应成立企业化的供应站。
    在农业技术方面，国营农场必须不断地提高农业技术，要在农业技术方面表现其优越性，必须将农业科学技术与农业实践很好地结合起来。农场应该很好的钻研提高农业技术。农业科学研究试验机关和农业学校，有责任帮助农场解决农业科学技术上的问题，经常派人到农场作研究工作和实习，使研究工作和农业生产结合起来，使学校的学习与农业的实践结合起来。
    目前在农业耕作技术上必须把深耕、平播、密植、秋翻地、开伏荒，规定成为制度，并很好地进行整地工作，各机械农场应根据条件实行轮作制，试行牧草轮作，以便培养地力，消灭杂草，稳定地提高产量。
    所有国营谷物农场要在二、三年内，完全使用优良品种，因此，必须注意选种、育种工作。国营农场应设试验区和采种田培养种子，首先是培育当地的优良品种。必须研究和分析土壤，以便积极地合理地施肥。要研究气候、雨量、霜期等自然情况，适时播种，适时锄草，适时收割，切实做到不误农时。要注意防止和消灭病虫害，以积极的态度采取预防措施，与自然灾害作斗争，争取丰产丰收。
    对机械技术与农业技术人员，必须进行政治思想教育，提高他们的觉悟，使他们积极的为农业生产服务。
    五、政治工作方面的任务
    国营农场是社会主义性质的企业，农场职工就是主人。国营农场必须建立有高度威信的强有力的政治工作，一切农场的干部必须树立依靠全体职工办好农场的思想，农场政治工作的基本任务就是不断的教育和发动全体职工提高职工的阶级觉悟，发挥高度的劳动积极性和创造性，以主人翁的态度，为完成与超过国家的生产计划而斗争。今年冬季应把整党、检查工作、思想建设、民主补课（没有进行“三反”的要进行“三反”）结合冬季工作发扬民主，发动全体职工，形成广泛深入的群众运动，彻底把农场进行整顿，为提高产量、消灭浪费、降低成本，准备明年大生产而努力。农场的党委要经常教育党员，在一切工作中起积极的带头作用，要切实把工会、青年团的工作充实起来。要在全体职工中树立坚强爱护国家财产的观念，党应经常不断地注意提高工人政治、文化和技术水平，结合冬季工作开展识字运动，推行速成识字法。
    经过群众运动，在职工政治觉悟提高的基础上，按照党章、党员标准，有计划的把运动中的积极分子吸收到党内来，壮大农场中党的力量。应当充分认识：如果农场没有坚强的党的支部，没有一定数量的党员在农场起骨干核心作用，农场工作是难以作好的。
    为了加强农场的政治工作，要设专职的副场长作政治工作。工会、青年团都要设专职干部。农场党
    的工作和政治工作，由当地县委和省委领导，凡够条件参加县委的场长或副场长可参加县委。为加强
    国营农场工会工作，应有准备的筹建产业工会。农场的工会应经常组织与发动劳动竞赛，开展合理化建议，推广先进经验，使职工的劳动热情，永远是
    饱满的。最后，一切农场必须在搞好生产的基础上，做好职工的福利工作。
    六、关于领导和作风问题要办好农场，党、政领导机关必须重视和加强对农场工作的领导。必须认识国营农场在经济上和政治上的重大意义。国营农场是改造小农经济吸引广大农民走向集体化、机械化的社会主义性质的国营企业，它将在农业集体化机械化中起骨干作用。斯大林同志说：“苏维埃农场继续的前进，它是改造农村中旧制度的主要骨干。许多的集体农场，继续的前进，它是改造农村中旧制度的主要骨干。许多的集体农场，就好像农村中新运动的根据地，跟在苏维埃农场后面前进。这两种系统底统一的工作，造成了苏联各州完全集体化的条件。”斯大林同志又说：“实际上苏维埃农场和它的新技术，它的空前的经济规模对附近农民的帮助，都是一种引导的力量，能够促进农民的转变，推动农民走向集体化的道路。”因此，对国营农场工作不加重视，对国营农场的重要性认识不足，将会犯严重的错误。我们必须壮大国营农场，必须把国营农场办好。各级党政领导机关必须把领导国营农场，办好国营农场当做自己的重要任务。过去我们对国营农场的工作注意不够，特别是农业部门注意的很差，今后必须纠正。
    我们必须珍贵已有的五百多个农场，并把它办好，以便教育农民，培养干部，取得经验，为农业集体化准备条件。
    为了加强对国营农场的领导，东北局农委和省委农委都要有专职干部研究农场工作，黑龙江、松江、辽西省农业厅设国营农场管理局，吉林、辽东、热河省农业厅设国营农场管理处，并要由一个副厅长专管农场工作。各省省委和政府要经常检查和讨论农场的工作，帮助农场总结经验，解决问题，帮助农场同志提高他们的工作和领导水平。
    县领导的国营农场其日常行政与业务可一律划归农业科管理，县委、县人民政府要十分重视对国营农场的领导。
    所有农场的领导干部必须认识自己岗位的重要性，应该了解党把国营农场这个重要的事业交给我们是光荣的，责任是重大的。因此，要埋头下去，树立坚强的事业心和高度责任心，兢兢业业，克服困难，深入实际，依靠职工很好的完成自己的任务。
    作好农场工作的一个重要条件，就是学习钻研。毛主席经常教导我们，不会的事只要学习，是可以学会的。农场工作是一个新的事业，不学习是不行的，必须向工人学习，向技术人员学习，向当地的农民学习，向苏联学习。苏联在机械化农业经营管理上，农业科学和机械技术上有极丰富的经验，必须结合我们的实际很好的学习，如果学好了，就可以少走许多弯路。
    一切农场领导部门的干部，必须养成深入实际联系群众的作风，农场干部应经常到农场，到作业区，到生产队，到庄稼地里去，学习并解决问题。要培养模范作业区，模范生产队，总结他们的经验，用以指导一般，要经常注意新鲜事物新经验，把职工的经验和创造加以总结推广出去，用这些办法提高农场的工作，提高农场的领导水平，我们必须具备这样的工作作风和学会这样的工作方法。我们有许多同志已经初步学到了一些机械化生产的知识，但决不能自满，应当进一步努力。
    为了交流农场的经验，各地党报应当适当的介绍国营农场的活动，并介绍苏联的经验，国营农场管理局可根据力量出不定期的刊物。
    为了帮助农场建立各种制度，使农场迅速地走上企业化正规化，国营农场管理局应根据东北局的决定，拟定一些必要的规程，以便迅速改进我们的工作。
    现在秋收已到，目前最中心的工作是作好秋收，要把这次会议的精神立即贯彻到秋收工作中去，保证丰产丰收。
    同志们！我们共产党人永远是向前看的，从来不满足已有的成绩，因为这些成绩同我们伟大的共产主义事业比较起来，同我们农场事业的远大前途比较起来，还是很微小的。我们从来也不掩饰工作中的缺点，不怕暴露工作中的缺点，因为我们的缺点是前进当中的缺点，只要我们勇于自我批评，勇于改正缺点，我们的事业就会不断的迅速的前进。
    同志们！中国革命在全国范围内取得胜利已经三年，三年来我们在毛主席领导下在各个战线上均取得了伟大的胜利，人民民主专政已日益巩固，经济建设已经恢复并超过了战前的最高水平。这是中国人民在毛主席领导下获得历史性的伟大胜利。我们即将开始大规模经济建设，我们的农场应当很好的准备，明年我们的农场将要大进一步，将要在产量上大大显示出机械化生产的优越性，让我们一致努力，让我们满怀信心的把国营农场办好，为迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设而奋斗！
