    The Soviet Union's Textbooks are the Most Advanced
    ——Experiences from Adopting the Soviet Textbook "Reinforced Concrete Structures"
    Reinforced Concrete Structure Teaching Group, Civil Engineering Department, Qingdao Institute of Technology
    Since the beginning of this semester, we have been using "Reinforced Concrete Structures" by I. Vilyansky, translated by Zhang Shou恭, as our textbook. In the past two months of teaching, we have experienced the superiority of Soviet textbooks from this book, and seen the brilliant light of Soviet science, thus fundamentally changing our past attitude of doubting Soviet science. Moreover, with the improvement of our teaching work, we increasingly feel that Soviet science is indeed the most advanced science in the world, and Soviet textbooks are the best textbooks.
    The transition from using American materials, which we were familiar with, to using Soviet materials, which we were not familiar with, involved a great deal of ideological struggle. During the ideological remolding movement in the first half of 1952, we seriously criticized the bourgeois ideological system, eliminated pro-American comprador ideology, and began to turn our attention to the Soviet Union, demanding to learn from the Soviet Union. However, at that time, we only "deduced" from theory and social system that Soviet science was combined with the masses, combined with actual production, was materialistic, and was based on facts, so it must be the best. But we didn't know how good it was, or in what way it was good, so we were still skeptical about the advancement of Soviet science. Moreover, at that time, some people did not agree with learning from Soviet academics. After listening to them, our confidence in learning from the Soviet Union was even more shaken. For example, sometimes we thought that Soviet textbooks were not so great; or that Soviet textbooks were only applicable to the Soviet Union and not to China, and even if we learned them, they would be useless. At that time, these incorrect ideas existed in the minds of many people, more or less, and we were no exception.
    However, based on our new understanding, we resolutely adopted Soviet textbooks. In the adjustment of departments, when all aspects of work were very busy and everyone did not have time to prepare lessons, we insisted on adopting this Soviet textbook that we ourselves had never seen before. After more than two months of learning and teaching, we have overcome many difficulties and gained a lot. Now we feel that Soviet textbooks are indeed the most advanced and highly scientific good textbooks, and we deeply feel "regret for not meeting sooner!"
    In the past two months, we have initially discovered the following advantages of Soviet textbooks:
    (1) The entire textbook is permeated with patriotism. It not only provides a clear explanation of the great achievements of the Soviet socialist country in reinforced concrete science, but also lists the names of Soviet concrete experts, the names and contributions of national concrete research institutions, and clearly states that the Soviet Union has far surpassed all capitalist countries in concrete theory, manufacturing, usage scale, and mechanization, enabling learners to recognize the greatness of the Soviet Union through their own work.
    (2) Basic concepts are explained in detail, and directions for future development are pointed out. The new textbook analyzes the various properties of concrete in great detail. The new textbook also emphasizes that: without a deep understanding of the characteristics of concrete materials, it is impossible to have good designs. This is completely different from capitalist textbooks. Capitalist textbooks mostly focus on the mechanical calculation of many design formulas, but say very little or do not mention at all the prerequisites for the formula calculation, and the physical meaning and scope of use of each formula; but the new textbook pays great attention to this. For example, when explaining various beams and columns, everything is calculated with this spirit, so that learners can have a clear understanding of each formula. Because it clearly explains the physical meaning of the formula, it makes a deep impression, is not easy to forget, and is not easy to use incorrectly.
    The new textbook shows a scientific attitude everywhere. Wherever there is no definite conclusion at present, it is clearly stated to inspire students' interest in independently studying problems. For example, the design principle based on limit state, reinforced concrete statically indeterminate structures, the redistribution of bending moments under plastic influence, prestressed concrete, precast concrete, etc., the new textbook points out specific research directions for students.
    Lenin said: "When lecturing, it is necessary to clarify the basic concepts of the course and point out the direction for deeper study." It can be said that Soviet textbooks have undertaken this important task.
    (3) Completely practical theories are adopted. For example, plastic theory, an advanced method designed according to the failure stage. Originally, reinforced concrete is an object with significant plasticity, which is universally recognized, and even capitalist countries admit it; however, capitalist countries still use the stress method, rigidly assuming that the stress and strain of concrete are proportional after being stressed, and further calculate all formulas from this. This is inconsistent with the actual situation and very different, but capitalist countries still conservatively use this old method.
    The Soviet Union has adopted plastic theory since 1938 and designed according to the failure stage. Designing according to this new method is not only in line with reality and convincing, but also can greatly save steel materials. Learning from this experience, how significant it is for China, where steel materials are currently expensive, and for the new China, which is starting large-scale construction!
    (4) The design specifications explained in the textbook have clear characteristics of careful calculation. Soviet science is the crystallization of in-depth research of advanced theories and countless large-scale experiments, as well as mass discussions among many scientists, so its engineering specifications are carefully calculated everywhere, and are much more economical than the specifications of capitalist countries that are specifically designed to promote the sales of goods for bosses. Adopting the Soviet Union's advanced, reasonable, and carefully calculated specifications has significant economic significance. Chairman Mao called on us to increase production and practice economy. Teachers in our colleges and universities should first learn from the Soviet Union's carefully calculated specifications and cultivate young engineers who can master new technical specifications, so as to save a large amount of wealth for the country and invest it in larger-scale construction.
    (5) Soviet textbooks not only have original Soviet advanced science, but also absorb the excellent parts of all capitalist countries' science.
    In the teaching process, we realized that Soviet textbooks far surpass American textbooks. Soviet science is a collection of all the achievements in world science, and then improved upon. Therefore, we can say that learning from the Soviet Union means that we have already learned all the excellent parts of all capitalist countries, and these many parts have been further improved.
    For example, when British and American capitalist countries calculate concrete beams subjected to shear, they calculate according to the situation after the concrete has cracked, which is consistent with the facts and reasonable. The Soviet Union also designs according to this situation, and does not create anything new, but the Soviet Union further makes it more reasonable. For example, American textbooks state that concrete has cracked and cannot bear tensile stress, but when calculating the principal tensile stress, it still bears some tensile force, which is obviously not convincing; while Soviet textbooks state that when the principal tensile stress exceeds a certain limit, the concrete has cracked and will not bear any tensile force at all thereafter. This is obviously reasonable. For another example, American textbooks say that longitudinal steel bars cannot bear oblique principal tensile force, which is obviously unscientific; while Soviet textbooks not only state that longitudinal steel bars can bear part of the principal tensile force, but also stipulate different percentages of principal tensile stress borne under different loads, which is obviously more reasonable and more advanced than American specifications.
    There are many such examples, too numerous to mention. In short, through the reform of reinforced concrete textbooks, we have initially realized that Soviet science is the most advanced science in the world, and it includes the excellent parts of the science of all capitalist countries.
    (6) Soviet textbooks reduce the design standard load while increasing the allowable stress of the material standard. The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government once pointed out: The Soviet Union's design load is 50% less than that of the United Kingdom and the United States, while the allowable stress of materials is increased by 20%. We completely agree with this statement.
    For example, for the live load of the roof, the United Kingdom and the United States stipulate at least 30 pounds per square foot, which is equivalent to 130 kilograms per square meter, but the Soviet Union stipulates it can be 75 kilograms. For general residences, hospitals, etc., the United Kingdom and the United States stipulate 50 pounds per square foot, which is equivalent to 250 kilograms per square meter, while the Soviet Union stipulates 150 kilograms per square meter; in general corridors, the United Kingdom and the United States stipulate 100 pounds per square foot, which is equivalent to 450 kilograms per square meter, but the Soviet Union stipulates 300 kilograms per square meter. These are all obvious examples.
    In terms of material design stress, Soviet engineering specifications are increased, which is of course based on numerous tests and reliable figures approved by all Soviet engineers. For example, in a concrete centrally compressed column, the design stress of concrete, according to British and American regulations, is 0.28 times the strength value of concrete, but the Soviet Union stipulates it to be more than 0.35 times the limit value. The above examples are all examples where the design stress adopted when the ultimate stress of the material is equal, that is, the percentage of the ultimate stress is increased. Therefore, we should no longer have the incorrect view that Soviet specifications are based on Soviet materials and are not suitable for Chinese materials.
    Since Soviet specifications have increased the material standard stress and reduced the design load, the Northeast Industrial Department pointed out: "...The loads we used to adopt in general structures are on average about 50% higher than the Soviet standards; the allowable stress of materials of the same specifications is on average about 20% lower than the Soviet standards;...Therefore, we have formulated the 'Provisional Standard for Structural Design of Buildings' (the reinforced concrete part of which is completely the same as the Soviet specifications). ...If implemented, without affecting the effectiveness of the use of buildings, the investment in civil engineering structure in 1952 can be saved by 20%..." The 20% savings in investment estimated by the Northeast Industrial Department is a huge figure. However, after studying the Soviet reinforced concrete structure design, we know that the figures estimated by the Northeast Industrial Department refer to the savings in the entire civil engineering structure. If we only consider the reinforced concrete structure, I am afraid that the percentage of savings will exceed 20%.
    (7) Soviet textbooks have concise content, but in-depth explanations. The new textbook only talks about the main and basic parts of this subject, with only essence and no dross, and the form of the basic formulas of this main part is also very simple. For example, the basic formulas for double-reinforced beams, T-shaped beams, or eccentric columns are very complicated in British and American textbooks, and it is simply impossible to apply them directly, only by using charts; while these formulas in Soviet textbooks are very concise, easy to remember, and easy to use. In addition, what is even more prominent is that it explains the physical meaning of each formula in detail, and explains the basic concepts of each formula very clearly. The application method, application range, design steps, etc., have detailed and in-depth analysis, which can enable learners to deeply think about each simple formula, thus easily cultivating students' ability to think independently and arouse students' interest in studying business and pursuing the truth. In the past two months of teaching, students often raised many questions that need to be studied in depth. Sometimes, we cannot even fully answer them. We think this is a gratifying phenomenon, which is the result of good textbook guidance.
    In the past two months, our thinking has undergone great changes with the progress of our teaching work: First, through our business work, we have further eliminated pro-American ideas. Every time we realize the superiority of Soviet science, we see the backwardness and conservatism of British and American science. British and American science and education are completely controlled by monopoly capitalists and serve monopoly capitalists. In order to maintain high monopoly profits, monopoly capitalists refuse to apply scientific inventions and creations that save materials, and even advanced scientists are subject to surveillance and persecution, thus greatly hindering the development of science. For example, if the specifications stipulate the use of more steel materials, the steel bosses will certainly welcome it. Therefore, those specifications that waste materials are difficult to improve in the countries they rule.
    We think: Why didn't China's scientific and educational circles learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science earlier? For example, our own teaching group comrades, we also thought that we were very "objective" scientific researchers, but why didn't we learn from the Soviet Union's advanced theory earlier? If we could have adopted Soviet reinforced concrete textbooks two years earlier (only saying two years earlier), how much money would our graduates have saved for the people! To answer this painful question, we can only frankly admit: In the old China, we were seriously affected by bourgeois ideology, especially by American imperialism, so there was a strong pro-American ideology, which limited our vision to the American circle, thinking that the United States was "the first in the world," and could not see the advanced science of the Soviet Union. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after the great ideological remolding movement, after attacking the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie, did our eyes turn to the Soviet Union, so that it was possible to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science.
    All the comrades in our group deeply recognized the superiority of Soviet science in the teaching process of adopting Soviet textbooks; at the same time, the teaching process is also a process of conducting ideological criticism related to our own business, thus further consolidating the achievements of ideological remolding.
    Although we have adopted Soviet textbooks, because our teaching methods are backward, we have not fully utilized the superiority of this textbook. Now everyone is learning Soviet advanced teaching methods. We see the highly responsible spirit and highly planned working methods of Soviet teachers, which make us feel even more that the level of various undertakings in the Soviet Union is the highest level in human history that has never been seen before, and thus feel our own insignificance even more. To be a good people's teacher, we must first be a primary school student of Soviet teachers. This is the conclusion.

    苏联的教材是最先进的教材
    ——采用苏联课本“钢筋混凝土结构学”的体会
    青岛工学院土木系钢筋混凝土结构教学小组
    从本学期开始，我们采用了苏联依·维扬斯著、章守恭翻译的“钢筋混凝土结构学”作课本。在两个多月的教学过程中，我们从这一课本体会到了苏联教材的优越性，看到了苏联科学的灿烂光芒，因而根本改变了过去怀疑苏联科学的态度；而且随着教学工作的改进，愈来愈感觉到苏联的科学，确是世界上最先进的科学，苏联的教材，更是最好的教材。
    我们从一向采用自己熟悉的美国材料，转变到采用自己所不熟悉的苏联材料，是曾经进行过不少思想斗争的：在一九五二年上半年思想改造运动中，我们严肃地批判了资产阶级思想体系，清除了崇美买办思想，开始把目光转向苏联，要求学习苏联；但当时只是从理论上、社会制度上，“推断”苏联的科学是和群众结合的，和实际生产结合的，是唯物的，是实事求是的，所以一定也会是最好的。但究竟好到什么程度，怎样好法，却不知道，因而对苏联科学的先进性，仍然是半信半疑的。而且当时有一部分人，不赞成向苏联的学术学习。听了他们的话，我们学习苏联的信心，也就更加动摇起来。例如有时认为苏联的教材也不至于有什么了不起；或者认为苏联的教材只适用于苏联，不能适用于中国，纵然学成也是无用。那时，这些不正确的想法，或多或少地存在于许多人的心中，我们也不例外。
    但是凭着新的认识，我们果断地采用了苏联的教材。在院系调整中，在各方面工作都十分忙乱，大家都没有工夫预备功课的情形下，我们坚持采用了这本连我们自己过去都没有看过的苏联教本。经过两个多月的学习和讲授，我们克服了许多困难，有了不少收获。现在我们已感觉到苏联教材确实是最先进、具有高度科学性的好教材，我们深有“相见恨晚”的感觉！
    我们在两个月当中，初步发现苏联教材有如下的优点：
    （一）整个教材都贯彻着爱国主义思想，它不仅对苏联社会主义国家在钢筋混凝土学方面的重大成就作了清楚的说明，而且列举了苏联混凝土专家的姓名、国家混凝土研究机构的名称和贡献，同时明确地说明了苏联在混凝土的理论、制造、使用规模及机械化等方面，已远远超过了所有资本主义国家，使学习的人，通过自己的业务，认识到苏联的伟大。
    （二）对基本观念讲解得很详细，并对将来的发展指出了方向。新教材对于混凝土的各种性能，分析得非常详细。新教材并着重地说明了：若对混凝土材料的特性无深刻了解，即不可能有良好的设计。这和资本主义的教科书是完全不同的。资本主义的教科书多半只注意许多设计公式的机械演算，但对于该公式演算的前提，及每个公式的物理意义和使用范围，却讲得很少，或者根本不提；但新教材则对此非常注意。例如在讲解各种梁、柱时，都是以这种精神演算一切公式，因此，使学习的人，对每个公式，都能有明确的了解。因为它清楚地说明了公式的物理意义，所以使人印象深刻，不易忘记，也不易用错。
    新教材处处表现着科学的态度，凡是目前尚无定论的地方，都明白地说出来，以启发同学独立钻研问题的兴趣。例如以限界状态为根据的设计原理，钢筋混凝土超静定结构，在塑性影响下，弯矩的重新分配，预应力混凝土，预制混凝土等等问题，新教材都为同学指出了具体的研究方向。
    列宁说：“讲课时必须明确所讲课程的基本观念，和指出更深入地去钻研的方向。”苏联的教材，可说已担当起了这个重要的任务。
    （三）采用了完全切合实际的理论。例如塑性理论，按照破损阶段而设计的先进方法。本来，钢筋混凝土是有显著塑性的物体，这是举世公认的，连资本主义国家也是承认的；但是在资本主义国家，迄今仍沿用应力方法，硬假设混凝土受力后应力和应变成正比，更由此演算出一切公式。这是和实际情况不符，而且相差很远的，但是资本主义国家，迄今仍保守地沿用这个老方法。
    苏联自一九三八年起，即采用塑性理论，按照破损阶段设计。根据这新方法进行设计，不但符合实际，使人信服，而且能够大大地节省钢料。我们学习这一经验，对于目前钢料贵重的中国，对于正在开始大规模建设的新中国，该有多么重大的意义！
    （四）教材所讲解的设计规范，有着鲜明的精打细算的特点。苏联的科学，是先进理论的深入研究和无数次大规模实验，以及许多科学家开展群众性讨论的结晶，所以它的工程规范处处是精打细算的，比资本主义国家专为老板推销货物的规范经济多了。我们采用苏联先进的、合理的、精打细算的规范，是有着重大的经济意义的。毛主席号召我们增产节约，我们高等学校的教师，应当首先学习苏联精打细算的规范，培养出能掌握新技术规范的青年工程师，才可以为国家节约大量的财富，投到更大规模的建设中去。
    （五）苏联教材中不但有苏联独创的先进科学，而且吸收了所有资本主义国家科学的优良部分。
    在教学过程中，我们认识到苏联教材远远超过了美国教材。苏联的科学是汇集了世界科学上所有成就，再加以提高而成的。所以说，我们学习苏联，即已经学习了所有资本主义国家的一切优良部分，而且这许多部分，又更进一步的提高了。
    例如英美资本主义国家计算受切混凝土梁时，是按混凝土有裂缝后的情形而计算的，这是符合事实的，也是合理的，苏联也是照这种情况加以设计，并不标新立异，但苏联却进一步地使它更合理。例如美国教材中，说明混凝土已经裂开，不能担负拉应力，但在计算主拉应力时，却又负担一些拉力，这显然不能使人信服；而苏联教材中，即说明当主拉应力超过某一限度后，混凝土既已裂开，此后即完全不负担任何拉力。这显然是合理的。又例如美国教材中说纵钢筋不能负担斜向主拉力，这显然是不科学的；而苏联教材中，不但说明纵钢筋可以负担一部主拉力，而且规定了在不同荷重下，负担不同的主拉应力百分数，这显然比美国规范合理得多，先进得多。
    这种例子很多，不胜枚举。总之，通过钢筋混凝土的教材改革，我们已初步体会到苏联的科学乃是世界上最先进的科学，它包括了所有资本主义国家科学的优良部分。
    （六）苏联教材降低了设计标准荷重，同时又提高了材料标准容许应力。东北人民政府工业部曾指出：苏联的设计荷重，比英美的少百分之五十，而材料容许应力，却提高百分之二十，我们完全同意这种说法。
    例如房顶活荷重，英美规定每平方呎至少三十磅，合每平方公尺一百三十公斤，但苏联规定可为七十五公斤。一般住宅、医院等，英美规定每平方呎五十磅合每平方公尺二百五十公斤，而苏联规定为每平方公尺一百五十公斤；一般走廊中，英美规定每平方呎为一百磅，合每平方公尺四百五十公斤，但苏联规定每平方公尺三百公斤，这都是很明显的例子。
    在材料设计应力方面，苏联工程规范则予以提高，这当然是根据无数次试验，经过全苏工程师认可的可靠数字。如混凝土中心受压柱内，混凝土的设计应力，按英美规定，为混凝土强度值的零点二八倍，但苏联规定为限值的零点三五倍以上。以上这些例子，都是在材料的极限应力相等时，所采用的设计应力，即极限应力的百分数予以提高，因此，我们决不应再有认为苏联的规范是根据苏联材料而定，不适于中国材料等不正确的看法。
    由于苏联规范提高了材料标准应力，还降低了设计荷重，所以东北工业部指出：“……我们过去在
    一般结构所采用的荷重，平均高于苏联标准百分之五十左右；相同规格的材料许可应力，平均低于苏联标准百分之二十左右；……因此我们制定了‘建筑物结构设计暂行标准’（其钢筋混凝土部分，即完全相同于苏联规范）。……如贯彻执行，在不影响建筑物使用效能的条件下，一九五二年土建结构投资部分，可以节省百分之二十……”东北工业部所估计的节省投资百分之二十，是一个巨大的数字。但我们研究苏联钢筋混凝土结构设计后，知道东北工业部估计数字，是指全部土木工程结构物的节省而言，若单以钢筋混凝土结构而论，恐怕节省百分数要超过百分之二十。
    （七）苏联教材内容精练，而讲解深入。新教材中，只讲这门学科的主要部分和基本部分，只有精华而无糟粕，而对此主要部分的基本公式，其形式也是很简单的。例如复筋梁、丁形梁或偏心柱的基本公式，在英美教材中，都是很复杂的，简直无法直接应用，只有利用图表；而苏联教材中的这些公式，都非常简明，容易记忆，也容易使用。此外更突出的是它详细地解释了每一公式的物理意义，把每一公式的基本概念交代得非常清楚，其应用方法，应用范围、设计步骤等，都有详细深入的分析，能够使学习的人深思每一个外形简单的公式，因而容易养成同学独立思考的能力，引起同学钻研业务、追求真理的兴趣。在两个多月的教学过程中，同学们常常提出许多须要深入钻研的问题，有时，我们甚至不能完全回答出来。我们认为这是可喜的现象，这是由于良好教材引导的结果。
    两个多月来，我们的思想随着教学工作的进展，起了很大变化：首先是通过我们的业务工作，进一步清除了崇美思想。每当我们体会到苏联科学的优越性时，我们就愈看出了英美科学的落后性和保守性。英美的科学和教育完全操纵于垄断资本家的手中，为垄断资本家服务，垄断资本家为了保持高额的垄断利润，拒绝应用节省材料的科学上的发明和创造，甚至先进的科学家还要遭到监视和迫害，因此大大阻碍了科学的发展。例如规范中若规定多用钢料，钢铁老板当然欢迎，因此，那些浪费材料的规范，在他们统治的国家内就难以改善了。
    我们想：为什么中国的科学界、教育界不更早地学习苏联这样的先进科学呢？譬如我们自己教学小组同志们，也曾以为自己是很“客观”的科学研究者，然而为什么不早学习苏联先进理论呢？若能早两年（只说早两年）采用了苏联钢筋混凝土教材，我们的毕业生将给人民节省多少资金！要回答这个令我们痛心的问题，我们只有坦白承认：我们在旧中国里，严重地受了资产阶级思想影响，特别是受了美帝国主义的影响，因而存在着浓厚的崇美思想，使我们目光局限在美国的圈子里，以为美国是“世界第一”，而看不见苏联的先进科学。只有在解放后，在共产党和毛主席领导下，在伟大的思想改造运动后，在打击了资产阶级的腐朽思想后，我们的目光转向了苏联，因而才有可能学习苏联的先进科学。
    我们全小组的同志们，在采用苏联教本的教学过程中，深切地认识到苏联科学的优越性；同时，教学过程，也就是进行和自己业务相联系的思想批判的过程，因此，进一步巩固了思想改造的成果。
    虽然我们采取了苏联教本，但由于我们的教学方法落后，所以我们并没有充分发挥这个教材的优越性。现在大家正在学习苏联先进教学方法，我们看到苏联教师高度负责的精神，和高度有计划的工作方式，使我们更感觉到苏联各种事业的水平，都是人类历史上不曾有过的最高的水平，因而更感到自己的渺小。要作一个良好的人民教师，必须先作苏联教师的小学生，这就是结论。
