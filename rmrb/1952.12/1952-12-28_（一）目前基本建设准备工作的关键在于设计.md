    (I) The Key to Current Capital Construction Preparatory Work Lies in Design
    Starting next year, our country will launch large-scale planned economic and cultural construction. The tasks of these constructions, especially the tasks of basic construction, are unprecedentedly arduous. Therefore, we must do all the preparatory work this winter and next spring to lay the foundation for next year's basic construction projects.
    Preparatory work for basic construction, especially design work, is generally more important than construction. If the preparatory work is not done well, it will directly damage the quality of the project, delay the progress of next year's construction, and also affect the basic construction plan for the year after and for a longer period. If we do one more part of preparatory work this year, we can reduce the difficulties of next year by ten parts. Therefore, in essence, completing the preparatory work is also completing a certain amount of engineering progress. Some people only see that the construction period of basic construction is greatly affected by seasonal factors, so they think that basic construction is "busy for half a year, idle for half a year; work for half a year, rest for half a year." They think that the current winter shutdown period is a good time to "rest," so they relax the work of transferring cadres to enrich basic construction institutions and the work of preparing for next year's basic construction projects. They think that the work is busy at the end of the year, and these things can be handled "slowly." This is obviously wrong.
    There are many preparatory tasks for basic construction. In the coming winter and the first quarter of next year, we must seize three links, cooperate closely with each other, and move forward simultaneously. That is to speed up the surveying and design work, organize and train the construction force, and actively prepare and transport engineering materials, among which design work is the most important. Because only by doing a good job in engineering design can we correctly calculate and prepare the construction force and engineering materials. In other words, only by grasping the design work can we drive all the preparatory work to proceed smoothly.
    Engineering design is by no means a purely technical issue. It is a combination of political economy and technology, and it is the key to determining the fate of each project. Whether the direction of the national basic construction is correct depends on the long-term plan of the country; and after the plan is set, whether each project in it is correct depends on the design. If the design is wrong, the new factories and mines may be wrong factories and mines. This kind of mistake is often difficult to remedy. In the past, we have had many examples that prove that due to design errors, the state's funds were wasted, production time was delayed, and the cost of products was increased. We must constantly learn from these experiences and improve design work.
    From the perspective of the basic construction procedure, the progress of all projects is first determined by surveying and design. And currently to the first quarter of next year, it is the time when the main design work needs to be completed or basically completed, otherwise, next year's construction plan cannot be completed. In the current preparatory work for basic construction, many are because the design plan has not been done well, so that the construction plan is inaccurate, the financial plan cannot be determined, and next year's preparatory work cannot be started, and the work falls into a passive position. In order to change this situation, it is also necessary to immediately strengthen the design work, so that the design work can catch up with the objective needs.
    In order to strengthen design work, it is necessary to establish and enrich design institutions, making them a powerful and effective department in basic construction work. Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council held a basic construction meeting in late October, the various ministries have gathered thousands of designers in the past two months. Although this is far from meeting the needs of actual work and has not reached the expected plan, the achievements we have achieved have exceeded the records of any era in Chinese history. We must quickly organize the existing manpower, immediately start work, and continue to expand and improve in the work.
    How to start this work? First of all, the designs should be "lined up" according to the priority of the project, the order of time, and the quality of the preparatory work, and a work procedure and schedule plan should be set to carry out the work rhythmically. Secondly, the designers should be divided according to their specialties, and the designers should be guided to deeply study the work to ensure the quality of the design work. Again, it is necessary to select standard designs suitable for general housing and school buildings to save design manpower and time to ensure the timely completion of major and large engineering designs. For units that are slow to gather designers, they should be constantly urged and criticized to ensure the continuous enrichment of the manpower of the design institutions.
    Our design work must adopt advanced standards and advanced engineering quotas. Otherwise, our new factory and mine construction and production work will be in an unreasonable state for a long time. Where to find advanced standards? This requires learning from the Soviet Union, summarizing domestic advanced experience and relying on the help of scientific research institutions. At present, the main thing is to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but it must be combined with the situation in our country and selected. In the past three years, due to the combination of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the labor of the working class in our country, we have created many new records on the economic front. We should quickly summarize these experiences as the basis for design work calculations; and continue to learn from the Soviet experience to improve design standards.
    For the design projects that have been formulated, we must quickly start reviewing them. Clarify its purpose, effect and interrelationship, establish advanced and reasonable technical quotas, distinguish between primary and secondary, study and grasp the sources of supply of various equipment and materials, so that the engineering design can be more reasonable and accurate. Reviewing the design is an important task and requires a considerable amount of time, so there should be strong leadership, and technical personnel should be gathered together to carry it out. At the same time, since the implementation of each project will involve many departments, therefore, when reviewing the design, the various departments must also cooperate with each other and support each other.
    The organization and training of the construction force and the preparation of basic construction engineering materials are also two urgent tasks this winter and next spring. At the meeting held by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on the 23rd of this month, Deputy Director Jia Tuofu gave detailed instructions on these two tasks, and the various departments must conscientiously implement them. In carrying out these two tasks, we must oppose the slack and slow phenomenon of not conducting precise calculations and not striving to prepare early, and also oppose the style of only considering the needs of our own department, disregarding the overall interests, and blindly competing for personnel and materials. Recently, in the work of fixing construction workers in various departments, the phenomenon of raising wages and arbitrarily attracting people has occurred. This must be corrected immediately.
    In order to prepare for next year's basic construction work, the tasks of the various departments are very heavy. The leadership work of the various departments must adapt to this situation and constantly improve. Therefore, the main responsible comrades of the various departments should personally grasp the basic construction work and conduct inspections and summaries in a timely and in-depth manner; the various departments should also cooperate well with each other and support each other, and oppose bureaucracy and departmentalism. Here, the展开 of criticism and self-criticism is of extremely important significance. We must firmly grasp this weapon to oppose all wrong and backward tendencies, in order to supervise and promote our work.

    （一）目前基本建设准备工作的关键在于设计
    我国从明年开始将展开大规模的有计划的经济建设和文化建设。这些建设的任务，尤其是基本建设的任务，是空前繁重的。因此，我们必须在今冬明春做好一切准备工作，为明年的基本建设工程奠定基础。
    基本建设的准备工作，特别是设计工作，在一般的情况下，比施工更为重要。准备工作做得不好，就会直接损害工程的质量，推迟明年建设的进度，也会影响后年和更长时期的基本建设计划。如果今年多做一分准备工作，就可以减少明年的十分困难。因此，从实质上说，完成准备工作也就是完成着一定的工程进度。有一些人只看到基本建设的施工期限受季节性影响很大，就认为基本建设是“半年忙，半年闲；半年工作，半年休息”。他们以为目前处于冬季停工期间，正好是
    “休息”的时候，因而把抽调干部充实基本建设机构的工作，把准备明年基本建设工程的工作都放松了。他们以为年底工作繁忙，这些事情都可“慢慢”办理。这显然是错误的。
    基本建设的准备工作很多，在今冬和明年第一季度必须抓紧三个环节，互相密切配合，同时前进。这就是加紧进行勘察设计工作，组织与训练施工力量，积极进行工程材料的准备与运输，其中又以设计工作最为重要。因为只有搞好了工程设计，才能正确地计算和进行施工力量的准备和工程材料的准备。也就是说，只有抓紧了设计工作这一环，才可以带动全部准备工作顺利前进。
    工程设计决不单纯是个技术性的问题，它是政治经济和技术的综合，是决定每一项工程的命运的关键。国家基本建设的方向是否正确，决定于国家长期的计划；而在计划已定之后，其中每一项工程是否正确，就决定于设计了。设计错了，新的工厂矿山就可能是一个错误的工厂和矿山。这种错误往往是难以挽救的。过去我们已有不少的例子，证明由于设计的错误，浪费了国家的资金，耽误了生产的时间，增加了产品的成本。我们必须经常从这些经验中吸取教训，改进设计工作。
    从基本建设的程序上来看，一切工程的进度，首先决定于勘察和设计。而目前到明年第一季度，正是需要把各项主要设计工作完成或基本完成的时候，否则，明年的施工计划就不能完成。在目前基本建设的准备工作中，很多都因为设计计划没有做好，以致施工计划不准确，财务计划没法定，明年的准备工作无从着手，工作陷于被动。为了改变这种情况，也必须立即加强设计工作，使设计工作迎头赶上客观的需要。
    为了加强设计工作，就需要建立与充实设计机构，使之成为基本建设工作中的一个强大有力的部门。十月下旬政务院财政经济委员会基本建设会议召开以后，两个月来，各部已集结了数千名设计人员，虽然这还远远赶不上实际工作的需要，也没有达到预定的计划，但我们所达到的成绩，已经超过了中国历史上任何时代的纪录。我们必须迅速将现有人力加以组织，立即开始工作，在工作中继续加以扩充和提高。
    这项工作如何开始呢？首先应按照工程的主次，时间的先后，准备工作的好坏，将各项设计进行“排队”，定出工作程序和进度计划，有节奏地进行工作。其次，应该按专业将设计人员进行分工，引导设计人员深入地钻研工作，保证设计工作的质量。再次，就是要选定适用于一般房屋与学校建筑的标准设计，以节省设计人力和时间，来保证及时完成主要的和大的工程设计。对于集结设计人员的工作进行迟缓的单位，要经常加以督促和批评，以保证继续不断地充实设计机构的人力。
    我们的设计工作，必须采用先进的标准和先进的工程定额。不这样就会使我们新的工厂矿山的兴建与生产工作长期地处于不合理的状态。从那里寻找先进的标准呢？这就要向苏联学习，总结国内的先进经验和依靠科学研究机关的帮助。目前，主要的是学习苏联先进经验，但须结合我国的情况，加以选择。过去三年来，由于苏联先进经验与我国工人阶级的劳动相结合，我们在经济战线上曾创造了很多新的纪录。对于这些经验，我们应该迅速地加以总结，作为设计工作计算的基础；并继续不断地学习苏联的经验，以提高设计标准。
    对于已经制订好了的设计项目，必须迅速开始审查。搞清它的目的、效果与相互联系，确立先进和合理的技术定额，分清主要次要，研究与掌握各种设备和材料的供应来源，这才能使工程设计更加合理和准确。审查设计是一项重要的工作，并且需要相当时间，因此应该有强有力的领导，集中技术人员共同进行。同时，由于每一项工程的进行都会牵涉到很多部门，因此，在审查设计时，各部门之间还必须互相配合，互相支持。
    施工力量的组织与训练、基本建设工程材料的准备，也是今冬明春刻不容缓的两项工作。在政务院财政经济委员会本月二十三日召开的会议上，贾拓夫副主任对这两项工作，作了详尽的指示，各部门必须认真加以贯彻。在进行这两项工作时，要反对不进行精密计算、不争取时间早作准备的松懈迟缓的现象，也要反对只顾本部门需要、不顾整体利益，盲目争夺人员和物资的作风。最近各部门在固定建筑工人的工作中，已发生高抬工资，任意拉人的现象。这是必须立即纠正的。
    为了准备明年的基本建设工作，各部门的任务是十分繁重的。各部门的领导工作，必须适应这一情况，不断提高。因此，各部门的主要负责同志，应该亲自掌握基本建设工作，及时地深入地进行检查与总结；各部门之间，也应该很好配合，互相支援，反对官僚主义与本位主义。在这里，批评与自我批评的展开是有极重要的意义的。我们必须紧紧掌握这一武器，来反对一切错误的和落后的倾向，用以督促和推动我们的工作。
