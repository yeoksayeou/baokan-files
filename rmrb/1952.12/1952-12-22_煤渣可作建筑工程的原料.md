    Coal Slag Can Be Used as Raw Material for Construction Projects
    Editor: I am a hygiene worker, and I recently started working at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. At the plant, I saw a large mountain of coal slag, occupying a large area. I thought: The plant uses a large amount of coal for steelmaking and coking every day, producing a large amount of coal slag. As such, the amount of coal slag will only increase, and the area it occupies will only get larger. How will it be handled in the future? I heard that construction projects need coal slag as a raw material. If the plant's coal slag is supplied to the construction department in a timely manner, wouldn't it benefit both parties? The situation of accumulating coal slag that cannot be disposed of may also exist in other factories. Therefore, I am submitting this suggestion to you, hoping that relevant departments will study and handle it.

    Reply from the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government
    People's Daily Reader's Letter Group: Comrade Liao Shourong's suggestion that the construction department should make full use of factory coal slag waste is very correct. Coal slag can be used to make hollow bricks. Hollow bricks have many advantages such as sound insulation, heat insulation, and moisture resistance (but they cannot be used as load-bearing walls). Coal slag mixed with lime can also be used to make tiles.
    At present, many factories and mines have accumulated a large amount of coal slag that cannot be disposed of, while construction projects cannot find coal slag when they need it. The reason for this situation is, of course, directly related to the quality of the coal slag and transportation costs, but the main reason is that there is no connection between the factories and mines and the construction departments. If the People's Daily calls on various factories and mines and construction departments to pay attention to this issue, then waste can be utilized, achieving two goals at once, and increasing a lot of wealth for the country.

### 煤渣可作建筑工程的原料

    煤渣可作建筑工程的原料
    编辑同志：我是一个卫生工作者，最近到石景山钢铁厂工作。在厂里，我看见有一个煤渣堆成的大山，占了很大的一块地方。我想：该厂炼钢炼焦每天要用大量的煤，出大量的煤渣；这样煤渣越来越多，地位越占越大，将来怎么处理呢？听说建筑工程中需要煤渣做原料。如果把该厂的煤渣及时供给建筑部门，不是对双方都有好处吗？而堆积煤渣无法处理的情况，可能在其它工厂也有。因此我把这个建议提给你们，希望有关部门研究处理。

    中央人民政府建筑工程部的答复
    人民日报读者来信组：廖守荣同志建议建筑部门尽量利用工厂煤渣废料，这是很正确的。煤渣可以做空心砖。空心砖能隔音、绝热和防潮湿，优点很多（但不能作承重墙）。煤渣和石灰混合，还可以制瓦片。
    现在很多厂矿积存大量煤渣无法处理，而建筑工程需要煤渣时竟找不到。所以造成这种情况，当然与煤渣质量和运输成本有直接关系，但主要原因是厂矿与建筑部门双方没有建立联系。如果通过人民日报号召各厂矿和建筑部门重视这个问题，那末废物利用、一举两得，可以为国家增加不少财富。
