Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued a "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Pesticide Use." The notice begins by stating: With the development of crop pest and disease prevention work, the types and quantities of pesticides used in various regions are gradually increasing. However, due to lax management in some areas and a failure to properly publicize usage methods, incidents of accidental injury to humans and animals have occurred. For example, in nine counties including Taikang and Shangqiu in Henan, careless use of red and white arsenic for seed dressing resulted in 258 cases of poisoning, 5 deaths, and the poisoning of 68 livestock and 580 chickens. To this end, the notice requires that the following points be noted in the future:

	(1) Strengthen the pesticide management system, strictly control and centrally manage usage: Provincial agricultural and forestry departments should cooperate with cooperatives and other relevant departments to formulate measures for the management, sale, and use of pesticides. For various toxic pesticides, efforts should be made to encourage collective purchasing and centralized use by the masses, and private merchants should be strictly prohibited from freely buying and selling highly toxic agents to humans and animals.

	(2) Universally publicize and impart pesticide usage methods and storage techniques: Agricultural cadres at all levels and cooperative cadres involved in pesticide management should strengthen their professional studies, summarize the masses' experiences in using and storing pesticides, and issue detailed and popular instruction manuals and pamphlets. More short-term training courses should be organized to promote usage techniques and common knowledge of storing agents.

	(3) All pesticide manufacturing factories must pay attention to the packaging of pharmaceuticals and overcome careless work habits: According to the toxicity of the agents and the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, various regions should adopt appropriate and safe packaging methods and make clear toxic markings on the outside of the packaging. When transporting goods, various regions must explain the precautions to workers in detail, and cooperative departments should purchase appropriate pesticide application equipment to sell to the masses along with the pesticides.

	(4) Leading cadres at all levels should continue to investigate and summarize the circumstances of past accidental injury incidents, identify the causes of the incidents, summarize experiences and lessons, and impose appropriate penalties on those responsible for the incidents in order to raise the attention of cadres at all levels to the use and management of pesticides.

The notice also made the following provisions for the use and management of "1065" pesticide: (1) The "1065" pesticide for 1953 should be used in cotton-growing areas with a better technical foundation. (2) All areas using the pesticide must organize pesticide mixing stations, which should be organized based on village agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams to form pesticide application groups, learn usage and storage techniques, and assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for mixing and use. Areas that have already established pesticide mixing stations should summarize their experiences, strengthen management systems, and implement dedicated personnel management. (3) "1065" is only allowed to be sold to organized pesticide application groups or pesticide mixing stations and cannot be sold arbitrarily. Empty lead containers after use should be collected by the county people's governments, properly stored, and await disposal. (4) Establish an inspection system to check not only the effectiveness of pesticide use but also to understand whether there have been any cases of misuse or accidental injury. If such incidents occur, the causes must be identified and dealt with promptly.

    中央农业部通知各地加强农药使用管理
    中央人民政府农业部日前发出“关于加强农药使用管理的通知”。通知首先说：随着农作物病虫害防治工作的开展，各地使用的农药种类和数量都在逐渐增加。但有些地区由于管理不严，也未很好地宣传使用办法，以致有误伤人畜的事件发生。如河南太康、商邱等九个县，因使用红白砒拌种不慎，有二五八人中毒、五人死亡、六八头牲畜和五八○只鸡被毒死。为此，通知要求各地今后必须注意以下几件事：
    （一）加强农药的管理制度，严格控制、集中使用：各省农林厅应协同合作社等有关部门订出农药管理、出售和使用的办法。对各种有毒的农药，应尽量动员群众集体买药，集中使用，严禁私商随便买卖对人畜有剧毒的药剂。
    （二）普遍宣传和传授农药的使用办法和保管技术：各级农业干部和经营农药的合作社干部，应加强业务学习，总结群众使用保管农药的经验，并印发详细的通俗的说明书、小册子。多开办短期的训练班，推广使用技术和保管药剂的常识。
    （三）各制造农药的工厂必须注意药品的包装，克服粗枝大叶的作风：各地应根据药剂的毒性和铁道部的规定，采取妥善安全的包装办法，在包装外面，作出有毒的鲜明标志。各地在搬运时要对工人详细说明注意事项，合作社部门应采购妥善的装药器具，随药卖给群众。
    （四）各级领导干部应继续检查和总结过去发生误伤事件的情况，找出肇事原因，总结经验教训，并对造成事件的有关人员，应严肃地分别给以适当处理，以提高各级干部对农药使用和管理工作的重视。
    通知并对“一○六五”农药使用管理作了如下规定：（一）一九五三年的“一○六五”应在棉区里技术基础较好的地区使用。（二）凡使用农药的地区必须组织配药站，应根据当地具体情况，以村农业生产合作社或互助组为基础，组织起来编成用药小组，学习使用、保管技术，配药和使用由专人负责。凡已经设立配药站的地区，应总结经验，加强管理制度，实行专人负责。（三）“一○六五”只准卖给组织起来的用药小组或配药站，不能随意出售，药用完了的空铅罐，由各县人民政府负责收回，妥善保管，听候处理。（四）建立检查制度，除检查药剂使用效果外，并注意了解有无误用、误伤事件发生，如有发生此项事件，须找出原因，并及时处理。
