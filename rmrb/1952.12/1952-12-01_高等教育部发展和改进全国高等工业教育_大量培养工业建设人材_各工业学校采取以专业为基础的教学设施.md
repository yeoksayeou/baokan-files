    Ministry of Higher Education Develops and Improves National Higher Industrial Education
    Massively Cultivates Talents for Industrial Construction
    All Industrial Schools Adopt Professional-Based Teaching Facilities
    [From Our Newspaper] In accordance with the urgent needs of large-scale economic construction, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and relevant business departments are striving to develop and improve the national higher industrial education, in order to effectively and massively cultivate senior industrial construction talents.
    In order to concentrate manpower and material resources and train senior industrial construction talents in a planned way, a large-scale adjustment of departments and faculties was carried out in national higher industrial schools this year. Before the adjustment, there were thirty-three higher industrial schools in the country, with more than 48,000 students. After the adjustment, the number of schools has increased to forty-four, and the number of students has increased to more than 68,000. The adjusted higher industrial schools are divided into multi-disciplinary industrial universities, such as Tsinghua University, Tianjin University, Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Chongqing University, and other multi-disciplinary industrial universities, and single-discipline specialized colleges and vocational schools, such as the Institute of Geology, Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Institute of Aeronautics, Institute of Chemical Engineering, Institute of Water Conservancy, Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture. At present, the number of students in various higher industrial schools has greatly increased. For example, Tsinghua University has increased from more than 2,000 to more than 5,000, Tianjin University has increased from more than 2,000 to more than 4,000, Harbin Institute of Technology has increased from 500 to 3,500, and Northeast Institute of Technology has increased from 900 to more than 5,000. The proportion of engineering students has also increased significantly. In 1946, engineering students accounted for only 18.9 percent of the total number of students in all universities and colleges. This year it has increased to 35.4 percent, ranking first among students in all disciplines. The number of new engineering students enrolled this year has reached more than 50 percent of the total number of students admitted in all disciplines.
    At present, higher industrial education adopts a policy of combining long-term training with short-term intensive courses. In the next few years, short-term intensive courses will account for a large proportion, so it is very important to run industrial specialized courses in large numbers and to run them well. Among the new students enrolled this year, specialized courses account for 55 percent, and undergraduate courses account for 45 percent. In the past, specialized courses were mostly handled by business departments entrusted to education departments. Now, according to the needs of the state, they have been changed to be set up by the education department in a unified manner. The graduation period for specialized courses is generally stipulated to be two years. In the past, the students' level was extremely uneven. Since this year, most of the students enrolled are high school graduates and those with equivalent academic qualifications. In addition, a considerable number of students are drawn from government agencies, military units, and industrial and mining enterprises. Therefore, the quality of students has been greatly improved.
    In old China, higher industrial education was actually just a decoration for the reactionary government. Not only was the establishment of schools and the setting up of departments and faculties unplanned and the training objectives extremely unclear, but also the teaching content and teaching methods had serious phenomena of disconnection between theory and practice. This kind of "general education" reflected the colonial nature of old China's education. At present, New China is on the eve of large-scale planned economic construction, and urgently needs to train a large number of industrial construction cadres. Therefore, according to the needs of national construction and referring to the advanced experience of Soviet higher education, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has set up "specializations" with very clear training objectives in various higher industrial schools across the country as the basic unit of teaching, and each specialization clearly stipulates what kind of specialized talents are to be trained. This is the biggest feature of higher industrial education in New China. For example, in order to train talents in the field of machinery, a variety of specializations such as mechanical manufacturing engineering, casting machines and casting engineering have been set up. In this way, under the finely divided specialized training, it is entirely possible to cultivate senior industrial construction talents who are sufficient in quantity and qualified in quality for the motherland's construction cause. Each specialization has a set of specific teaching plans. Several specializations with similar properties are combined to form a department, which becomes a teaching administrative unit. This is completely different from the unplanned establishment of departments and faculties in higher industrial schools in old China, the blind running of schools, and the so-called "general education" policy that separates theory from practice. At present, according to the urgent needs of national construction, undergraduate courses in higher industrial schools across the country have set up about 100 specializations, and specialized courses have set up about 70 specializations. For example, eleven higher industrial schools in North China have set up a total of sixty-three specializations in undergraduate courses, such as mechanical manufacturing engineering, metal cutting machine tools, casting engineering, automobiles, thermal power equipment, fuel chemical industry, and internal combustion engines, and thirty-seven specializations in specialized courses, such as metalworking, geological exploration, power transmission and distribution. Sixteen higher industrial schools in East China have set up a total of fifty-five specializations in undergraduate courses, such as mechanical manufacturing, industrial enterprise electrification, industrial and civil construction, chemical production machinery and equipment, and forty-nine specializations in specialized courses, such as power plant overhaul, power transmission and distribution, hydraulic engineering construction, and industrial analysis.
    After setting up specializations, teachers in various schools have conscientiously studied the advanced Soviet teaching system and experience. They have begun to recognize the superiority of the advanced Soviet educational experience, and therefore a upsurge of learning Russian has been universally launched. In addition, they have also translated a large number of Soviet higher education teaching outlines and textbooks as textbooks for various specializations according to the required courses specified in the education plans of various specializations. In order to implement the teaching plan, improve teaching quality, and improve teaching methods, many schools have also universally or selectively established teaching research groups for various specializations, and carried out collective lesson preparation, compilation of teaching materials, and planned training of teachers and graduate students. For example, Harbin Institute of Technology is the earliest new-type higher industrial school in the country to learn from the advanced Soviet experience. Due to the study of the Soviet teaching plans and teaching system, the adoption of Soviet textbooks, the enrichment of the content of specialized courses, the guarantee of the improvement of teaching quality, and the strengthening of the connection between theory and practice, the students' professional level and independent working ability have been significantly improved.
    Many new types of higher industrial schools have expanded and built large-scale new school buildings due to the needs of development, and have enriched equipment such as instruments and books. For example, the total area of Tsinghua University's construction this year is more than 43,000 square meters, which is equivalent to 46 percent of the total construction area of Tsinghua University in the past 40 years. The new buildings include classroom buildings, mechanical practice factories, metalworking rooms in the civil engineering department, automobile factories, gas factories, student dormitories, faculty residences, and a large dining hall that can accommodate 2,500 people. The architectural design, construction, and procurement of these projects are all done by the teachers and students of the school's construction and civil engineering departments. The new campus of Tianjin University in Qilitaizi was still a piece of open space half a year ago, but now a large-scale building complex has appeared. Northeast Institute of Technology has built a large-scale and well-equipped metallurgical building, which contains laboratories for iron and steel metallurgy, non-ferrous metallurgy, physical metallurgy, high-temperature manufacturing, as well as metal microscope rooms, microscope photography rooms, X-ray laboratories, induction furnaces, and instrument manufacturing laboratories. In order to facilitate professors to carry out teaching and research work, there are thirty-three teaching and research rooms and a special library and reading room on the third floor.
    With the rapid development of higher industrial education, especially after the adjustment of departments and faculties and the setting up of specializations, all schools basically adopt the Soviet teaching plan. However, teachers are unfamiliar with the new teaching plan. Although teachers are generally actively learning the Soviet teaching plan, they still cannot fully adapt to the new teaching tasks. Therefore, improving the existing teachers and training new specialized teachers is still an urgent problem. According to the existing conditions, the best way to train teachers is to strengthen the training of graduate students and teaching assistants. At the same time, after the specialization is determined, there is an urgent need to translate a large number of Soviet teaching materials and textbooks. Therefore, how to unify, organize, and guide the national textbook translation work and improve the translation quality is also a problem that should be paid great attention to. The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government is actively trying to solve these problems in conjunction with relevant departments.

    高等教育部发展和改进全国高等工业教育
    大量培养工业建设人材
    各工业学校采取以专业为基础的教学设施
    【本报讯】根据大规模经济建设的迫切需要，中央人民政府高等教育部及有关业务部门正努力发展和改进全国的高等工业教育，以期有效地、大量地培养高级工业建设人材。
    为了集中人力、物力，有计划地培养高级工业建设人材，今年全国高等工业学校进行了大规模的院系调整工作。调整前，全国共有高等工业学校三十三所，学生四万八千余人，调整后学校已增加为四十四所，学生增加为六万八千余人。调整后的高等工业学校分为多科性工业大学，如清华大学、天津大学、交通大学、浙江大学、哈尔滨工业大学、重庆大学等多科性工业大学，和单科性的各种专门学院以及专科学校，如地质学院、钢铁学院、航空学院、化工学院、水利学院、矿冶学院、土木建筑学院等。目前各高等工业学校的学生人数都已大大增加。例如清华大学从二千多人增加到五千多人，天津大学从二千多人增加到四千多人，哈尔滨工业大学从五百人增加到三千五百人，东北工学院从九百人增加到五千多人。工科学生的比重也显著增加，一九四六年工科学生仅占全部高等学校学生总数的百分之十八点九，今年已增加到百分之三十五点四，占各科学生人数的第一位。今年全国工科录取的新生更达到各科学生录取总数的百分之五十以上。
    目前高等工业教育是采取长期培养和短期速成相结合的方针。在今后几年内，短期速成将占极大比重，因此大量举办工业专修科并办好专修科就是很重要的任务。在今年招收的新生中，专修科占百分之五十五，本科占百分之四十五。过去，专修科多半是由业务部门委托教育部门办理的，现已根据国家需要改为由教育部门统筹设置。专修科毕业年限一般规定为二年。学生程度过去极不整齐，自今年起所招收的学生，绝大部分是高中毕业生及具有同等学力者，另外有相当数量的学生，是从机关、部队、工矿抽调的。因而学生质量已大大提高。
    在旧中国，高等工业教育实际上只是反动政府的装饰品。不仅学校的设立和院系的设置毫无计划，培养目标极不明确，而且教学内容和教学方法有严重的理论和实际脱节的现象。这种“通才教育”反映了旧中国教育的殖民地性质。目前，新中国正处在大规模的有计划的经济建设前夕，急需要培养大批工业建设干部。因此，中央人民政府高等教育部根据国家建设需要，参照苏联高等教育的先进经验，在全国各高等工业学校设置了培养目标十分明确的“专业”，作为教学的基本单位，每种专业都明确地规定了培养何种专门人材。这是新中国高等工业教育的一个最大的特点。如为了培养机械方面的人材，便设置了机械制造工程、铸造机及铸造工程等多种专业。这样在分工精细的专业训练下，就完全可能为祖国建设事业培养数量足够和质量合格的高级工业建设人材。每种专业都有一套具体的教学计划。几种性质相近的专业，合组成系，成为一个教学行政单位。这和旧中国高等工业学校院系设置漫无计划，盲目办学，以及理论脱离实际的所谓“通才教育”方针是完全不同的。目前，根据国家建设的迫切需要，全国高等工业学校本科共设置了约一百种专业，专修科设置了约七十种专业。如华北区十一所高等工业学校本科共设置了机械制造工程、金属切削机床、铸造工程、汽车、热力发电设备、燃料化学工业、内燃机等六十三种专业，专修科设置了金工、地质勘探、输电及配电等三十七种专业。华东区十六所高等工业学校，本科共设置了机械制造、工业企业电气化、工业和民用建筑、化学生产机器及装备等五十五种专业，专修科共设置了动力厂检修、输电及配电、水力技术建筑、工业分析等四十九种专业。
    各校在设置了专业以后，教师都认真地学习了苏联先进的教学制度和经验。他们已开始认识到苏联先进教育经验的优越性，因而普遍掀起了学习俄文的热潮。另外，他们并根据各专业的教育计划所规定的必修课程，大量翻译了苏联高等教育的教学大纲和教材，作为各专业的教材。为了贯彻教学计划，提高教学质量，改进教学方法，许多学校并已普遍或重点地成立了各专业的教学研究组，展开集体备课、编译教材以及有计划地培养师资和研究生的工作。如哈尔滨工业大学是最早学习苏联先进经验的全国新型高等工业学校。由于学习了苏联的教学计划和教学制度，采用了苏联的教材，充实了专门课程的内容，保证了教学质量的提高，加强了理论和实际的联系，该校学生的业务水平和独立工作能力显著提高。
    许多新型的高等工业学校，由于发展上的需要，都扩充和修建了规模宏大的新校舍，并充实了仪器、图书等设备。如清华大学今年的建筑，总面积共达四万三千多平方公尺，相当于清华大学四十年来建筑总面积的百分之四十六。新的建筑有教室大楼、机械实习工厂、土木系金工间、汽车工厂、煤气工厂、学生宿舍、教授住宅以及能容二千五百人的大饭厅等。这些工程的建筑设计、施工、采购等工作都是由该校营建、土木等系师生自己动手做的。天津大学的七里台新校址，半年以前还是一片空地，现在已出现一片规模宏大的建筑物了。东北工学院修筑了规模宏大、设备完善的冶金学馆，里面有钢铁冶金、有色冶金、物理冶金、高温制造等实验室以及金属显微镜室、显微镜照像室、爱克斯光实验室、诱导电炉、仪器制造试验室等。为了便于教授们进行教学研究工作，在三楼设有三十三个教学研究室和专门的图书库、阅览室。
    随着高等工业教育的迅速发展，尤其在院系调整、设置专业以后，各校基本上都是采用苏联的教学计划，而教师们对于新的教学计划是陌生的，虽然教师们一般都在积极学习苏联教学计划，但仍不能完全适应新的教学任务，因而提高现有师资和培养新的专业师资仍是当前迫切的问题。根据现有的条件，培养师资的最好的办法，是加强研究生和助教的培养工作。同时在专业确定后，迫切需要翻译大量的苏联教材和课本，因此如何统一组织和指导全国的教材翻译工作，提高翻译质量，也是应该十分注意的一个问题。这些问题，中央人民政府高等教育部正会同有关部门积极设法解决。
