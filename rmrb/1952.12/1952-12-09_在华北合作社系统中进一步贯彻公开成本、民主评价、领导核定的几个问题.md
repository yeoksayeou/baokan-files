Concerning Further Implementation of Open Cost, Democratic Evaluation, and Leadership Verification in the North China Cooperative System
Director of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Li Zheren

During the campaign for increased production and conservation, the North China region's cooperatives widely promoted the experience of open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification. The implementation of this experience in various localities has universally proven the following benefits: (1) Breaking the bad habit of "commercial secrets," correcting high-profit thinking, and verifying commodity prices; (2) Combining with the inventory of warehouses, commodity ranking, and the holding of material exchange meetings to clear out accumulated commodities, expand business, and accelerate capital turnover; (3) Promoting democracy, strengthening the relationship between the cooperative's upper and lower levels and between the cooperative and its members, and consolidating and developing the organization.

However, because some local leaders and business personnel lack sufficient understanding of the important significance of open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification, and are not good at using advanced experience to promote and improve work, they have not actively promoted the experience of open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification. Some have begun to promote this experience, but only disclose the cost of goods with small profits, not the cost of goods with large profits; only disclose the cost of slow-moving goods, not the cost of fast-selling goods; or they are loose in calculating costs and secretly hide profits. In short, they have adopted various methods of resistance. As for the phenomenon of being incomplete and not thorough, it is even more common. When some grassroots cooperatives disclose costs, they do not carry out publicity and explanation work to the members, nor do they mobilize the masses. Only a few accounting and business personnel write out cost lists and announce them to the members or member representatives, without accounting or discussion, which makes this important work a mere formality. It is particularly noteworthy that some cadres do not fully understand the complete significance of open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification, and a tendency towards simple price reductions and blind price reductions has occurred in some areas. When they lower prices, they also only start from reducing profits (such as high profits, which should of course be reduced), and do not pay enough attention to accurately calculating costs and striving to improve operations to reduce costs. Many cooperatives still do not know how to correctly calculate costs. Therefore, although the cost is open, they still do not know how to make ends meet, and still do not know whether they are making or losing money. Some only regard open cost and democratic evaluation as a means of selling slow-moving goods, and therefore are satisfied with clearing out slow-moving goods and expanding sales. Because they have not conducted correct price policy education in the democratic evaluation, some cooperatives have set the prices of some commodities too low, which not only cannot achieve reasonable accumulation, but even causes losses. All of these have hindered the promotion of this advanced experience to a considerable extent, which deserves attention and prevention from all localities. In addition, most areas have not paid attention to taking appropriate measures to make open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification a regular system, which should also attract everyone's attention.

Based on the above situation, in order to further correctly implement the work of open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification, the following three issues must be resolved:

First, all ideological obstacles and concerns of cooperative cadres should be eliminated, and the system of open cost should be resolutely, universally, and without exception implemented. Those operating units of some federations of cooperatives and some grassroots cooperatives that have not yet disclosed costs should disclose them regularly. All cooperative cadres should recognize the important significance of open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification, and should regard open cost as a movement for ideological and business improvement, and according to the specific conditions of their own organization's business, pass a resolution through democratic inspection to make it a system and discipline. The main purpose of open cost and democratic evaluation is to break commercial secrets, expose unreasonable phenomena in operation, mobilize the masses to discuss, revise, and supervise the implementation of various quota management systems in order to improve operation. Therefore, open cost must be closely combined with accurate cost accounting, promotion of quota management, and improvement of operation to make it a movement to carry out mass economic accounting. If this point is not understood, and a hasty and simple perfunctory attitude is taken to open cost or simply reduce prices, it will certainly not be able to exert its active role. Those views and practices that think that the matter is over when slow-moving goods have been sold out, cost lists have been opened, and prices have been lowered are all wrong and must be resolutely corrected. Therefore, units that have disclosed costs but have not seriously accounted for costs should take another lesson, putting forward the slogan of "open cost, verify cost, reduce cost, and enable cooperatives to obtain reasonable accumulation," and strive to find loopholes and improve operations. In order to account for costs, it is necessary to first call on all cadres to learn to calculate costs and advocate careful calculation. When calculating costs, many units often neglect to include expenses such as interest, loss, and taxes, which should be noted. Second, it must be recognized that the key to reducing costs is to reduce circulation expenses. The focus of reducing circulation expenses is to accelerate capital turnover. In order to accelerate capital turnover, business must be planned. According to the experience of various localities, the indirect circulation expenses of grassroots cooperatives (especially administrative management expenses) and the direct circulation expenses of federations of cooperatives at all levels, such as freight and interest, account for the largest part of the expenses. If we cannot grasp the key points and effectively reduce them, the so-called reducing circulation expenses and reducing costs will be empty words.

Second, price policy must be correctly grasped. It should be pointed out that the process of mobilizing the masses for democratic evaluation is also the process of correctly implementing price policy; at the same time, democratic evaluation must be combined with leadership verification, otherwise deviations will inevitably occur. At present, some cadres still have some confused concepts about what is called "high profit" and what is called "reasonable profit." They do not distinguish between specific situations, do not distinguish what kind of goods, as long as the gross profit margin exceeds a certain amount, it is collectively referred to as "high profit." This is wrong. We want to implement the new financial accounting system promulgated by the National Cooperative and adopt the method of calculating selling prices based on net profit rather than gross profit. Gross profit includes a part of indirect circulation expenses. If we oppose the net profit that has been expanded due to efforts to reduce circulation expenses as "high profit," that is very wrong. Certain commodities are given a higher profit margin because of slower turnover or because of special conditions, and this should not be regarded as high profit. To check whether the profit margin of each business unit is reasonable, it is also necessary to compare the profit margin of individual commodities with the comprehensive profit margin, and neither should be neglected. All these situations and reasons must be made clear to all cadres and the majority of members. When deciding the actual selling price of a commodity, it must be specifically determined according to the accurately calculated cost plus taxes and appropriate profit, and with reference to the listed prices and market prices of state-owned companies. It is inappropriate to be higher than the market price, lower than the market price, or lower than the prices of state-owned companies. In the past, we did not pay attention to the study of the price of commodities as we did to cost accounting. This situation should be changed in the future, and the prices of our cooperative's commodities should be correctly adjusted.

Third, open cost, democratic evaluation, and leadership verification should be made a regular system. According to the experience of various localities, first, cooperatives should universally attach cost accounting sheets with goods; second, federations of cooperatives at all levels should establish special price management agencies, and manage the cooperative's price work under the direct leadership of the board of directors. The board of directors of societies at all levels should include price issues in their main agenda and report them as an important content to the membership congress or congress of representatives. Some localities have established democratically elected evaluation committees in grassroots societies, and this method can be tried and promoted. In short, the price work of the cooperative should be established immediately to overcome the state of anarchy in price policy, and gradually replace the cumbersome practices of appraisal and assessment. Third, the economic accounting system should be conscientiously promoted, and quota management should be implemented. At present, the level of our operation and management should be improved according to the four quota rates stipulated by the National Cooperative.

    在华北合作社系统中进一步贯彻公开成本、
    民主评价、领导核定的几个问题
    华北供销合作总社主任　李哲人
    在增产节约竞赛运动中，华北区合作社广泛推行了公开成本、民主评价、领导核定的经验。各地推行此项经验的情况，普遍证明实行公开成本、民主评价、领导核定有以下作用：（1）打破了“商业秘密”的恶习，纠正了高额利润思想，核订了商品价格；（2）结合清查仓库、商品排队、召开物资交流会等工作，清理了积压的商品，扩大了业务，加速了资金周转；（3）发扬了民主，密切了合作社上下级间和合作社与社员的关系，巩固和发展了组织。
    但是，由于有些地方的领导干部和经营人员对公开成本、民主评价、领导核定的重要意义认识不足，不善于利用先进经验推动和改进工作，所以他们还没有积极推行公开成本、民主评价、领导核定的经验。有的虽已开始推行这种经验，但只公开利润小的商品的成本，不公开利润大的商品的成本；只公开冷背货的成本，不公开畅销货的成本；或在计算成本时宽打窄用，暗藏利润。总之，他们采取了种种抵抗的办法。至于不彻底、不深入的现象，就更加普遍了。有些基层社公开成本时，不向社员进行宣传解释工作，也不发动群众，只是由少数会计、业务人员写出成本单子，向社员或社员代表公布一下，又不进行核算和讨论，致使这一重要工作流于形式。特别值得注意的是：某些干部对公开成本、民主评价、领导核定的完整意义认识不够，部分地区曾经发生了单纯降价和盲目降价的偏向。他们降低价格也是只从降低利润方面着手（如确属高额利润，当然是应该降低的），而对精确计算成本，努力改进经营，以降低成本，则重视不够。不少合作社至今还不会正确地计算成本，因此，虽然公开了成本，但心中仍然无数，赔赚依然不知。有的只把公开成本、民主评价作为推销冷背货的手段，因此便以清理了冷背货、扩大了销货额为满足。由于在民主评价中没有进行正确的价格政策教育，有些合作社把某些商品价格定得偏低，不仅不能实行合理的积累，甚至发生赔钱现象。所有这些都在相当程度上阻碍了这一先进经验的推广，是值得各地注意防止和克服的。此外，多数地区还没有注意采取适当措施，把公开成本、民主评价、领导核定作为经常的制度，这种现象也应引起大家注意。
    根据以上情况，为了进一步正确地贯彻公开成本、民主评价、领导核定的工作，必须解决以下三个问题：
    首先应扫除合作社干部思想上的一切障碍和顾虑，坚决地、普遍地、无例外地施行公开成本的制度。某些联社的经营单位和部分基层社尚未公开成本者，应该定期公开。合作社所有干部应该认识到公开成本、民主评价、领导核定的重要意义，应该把公开成本看作是一个思想与业务的改进运动，并根据本身组织业务的具体条件，经过民主检查通过决议，把它定为一个制度和纪律。公开成本、民主评价的主要目的是在于打破商业秘密，暴露经营中的不合理现象，发动群众讨论、修订和监督施行各项定额管理，以便改进经营。因此，公开成本就必须和精确核算成本、推行定额管理、改进经营紧密结合起来，使其成为开展群众性经济核算制的运动。如果不了解这一点，而采取草率的、简单的应付公事的态度去公开成本或单纯降价，一定不能发挥其积极作用。那种认为冷背货已销出、已开出了成本单子、价格已降低了就完事大吉的看法和做法，都是错误的，必须坚决改正。因此，已公开成本但未认真核算成本的单位，都应再补一课，提出“公开成本，核定成本，降低成本，并使合作社得到合理积累”的口号，务求达到找出漏洞，改进经营的目的。为核算成本，首先必须号召所有干部学会计算成本，并提倡精打细算。不少单位计算成本时，往往将利息、损耗、税金等项开支忽略计入，应提起注意。其次，必须认识，降低成本的关键是降低流转费用。降低流转费的重点是加速资金周转。为了加速资金周转，必须根据计划经营业务。据各地经验证明：基层社的间接流转费（尤其是行政管理费），各级联社的运费和利息等直接流转费，都占着开支的最大部分，如不能抓住重点，有效地加以减少，所谓降低流转费和降低成本将是
    一句空话。
    第二、必须正确地掌握价格政策。应该指出：发动群众民主评价的过程，也是正确地贯彻价格政策的过程；同时，民主评价必须和领导核定相结合，否则势必发生偏向。目前有些干部对什么叫“高额利润”，什么叫做“合理利润”还有一些糊涂观念。他们不区别具体情况，不分什么商品，只要毛利率超过多少，就统称为“高额利润”。这是错误的。我们要施行全国合作总社公布的新的财政会计制度，采取以纯利而不以毛利计算售价的办法。毛利中包括着一部分间接流转费，如果把因为努力降低流转费而扩大了的纯利作为“高额利润”去反对，那是十分不对的。某些商品因为周转较慢或因有特殊条件而被规定了较高的利润率，也不能视为高额利润。检查每个经营单位的利润率是否合理，还须把个别商品的利润率和综合利润率加以对照，不可偏废。上述这些情况和道理必须使所有干部和广大社员明白。决定商品的实际售价时，须按精确计算了的成本加上税金和适当的利润，再参照国营公司牌价和市价作具体确定，高于市价、过低于市价、或过低于国营公司牌价，都是不妥当的。过去我们对商品的价格问题如同对成本核算一样，是没有注意研究的，今后应改变这一情况，正确地将我们合作社的商品价格加以调整。
    第三、要把公开成本、民主评价、领导核定成为经常的制度。根据各地经验，首先，合作社应普遍随货附发成本核算单；第二，各级联社一律建立专管物价的机构，在理事会直接领导下管理合作社的物价工作。各级社的理事会应将价格问题列入自己的主要议事日程之内，并将它作为向社员大会或代表大会报告的重要内容。有些地方在基层社设立了民主选举的评价委员会，这种办法可以试行推广。总之，要立即建立合作社的物价工作，以克服在价格政策上的无政府状态，并使之逐渐代替宗宗评价和次次评价的繁琐做法。第三，认真地推行经济核算制度，实行定额管理，目前即应根据全国合作总社所规定的四项定率，提高我们的经营管理的水平。
