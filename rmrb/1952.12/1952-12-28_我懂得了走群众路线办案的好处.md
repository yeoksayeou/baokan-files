    I Understand the Benefits of the Mass Line in Handling Cases
    Comrade Editor: I work in the Yishui Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong. Originally, I thought: "The masses are afraid of the courts; the mass line in judicial work is unworkable." I also believed that "courts can only hear cases in court." If cases are not heard in the "courtroom," it would be too "undignified." But the vivid facts in the judicial reform movement educated me.
    The Twelfth District of Yishui County has a total of forty villages and 19,800 people. After six cadres from the county people's court organized the masses to handle cases in the district, they handled 487 cases in just fifteen days. Many problems that had accumulated for seven or eight years were completely resolved this time. Some couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law had not spoken to each other for many years. After education combining case handling on harmony and unity, gender equality, and striving for production, the unfortunate situation was changed. The relationship between the masses and the court has also become closer. Li Wentang's wife said: "I have never heard of a court coming to the countryside to handle cases since ancient times. In the old society, it was difficult to see a judge no matter how much money you spent to file a lawsuit." Some old men asked: "Where did you learn this method from?" When the court cadres told him that this was Chairman Mao's method, some happily said: "Chairman Mao really thinks carefully for the people." When the masses saw the court cadres, they always shook hands warmly, or wanted to pull them home to talk. "Come often in the future! You have solved big problems for us this time." These were the two loudest sentences the masses said when they parted with the court cadres. Some village cadres said: "It's better than receiving a training session; we have found a way to solve problems." Although the judicial personnel were very busy after mobilizing the masses to handle cases, they were very happy. Everyone felt that they had let the people down in the past and had done too little. The 487 cases handled this time would not have been completed in a year if they had been handled in the office; they regretted the old judicial style of only knowing how to "hear cases in court" and "handle cases on my own" in the past. Because the judicial policies were explained comprehensively and deeply in combination with mobilizing the masses to handle cases, more than 15,000 people, directly or indirectly, received judicial education, accounting for more than 76% of the total population of the district.
    I deeply understand the benefits of the mass line in handling cases.

    我懂得了走群众路线办案的好处
    编辑同志：我在山东沂水专署工作。本来我认为：“群众对法院有惧怕心理；司法工作要走群众路线是走不通的。”我还认为，“法院只能坐堂问案。”如果不在“法堂”上问案，那太不“庄严”了。但司法改革运动中活生生的事实教育了我。
    沂水县第十二区，共四十个村，一万九千八百人。经县人民法院干部六人到该区组织群众办案，仅十五天时间，就办理了四百八十七件案子，有许多问题是七、八年来长期积压下的，这一次彻底解决了。有的夫妻、婆媳之间多年不说话，经结合办案进行和睦团结、男女平等、努力生产等教育后，使那不幸的情况改变了。群众和法院的关系也密切了。李文堂的妻子说：“自古来没听说法院下乡来办案的。在旧社会打官司，花多少钱也难见到法官。”有的老大爷问：“你们这个办法是从那里学来的？”当法院干部告诉他，这是毛主席的办法。有的高兴地说：“毛主席真是为人民想得周到。”群众见着法院干部时，总是热烈地握手，或者要拉到家里去谈谈。“你们今后常来啊！这次给我们解决了大问题。”这是群众和法院干部分手时说得最响亮的两句话。有的村干部则说：“比受一次训还好；可找到解决问题的门路了。”发动群众办案后，司法人员虽然很忙，但忙得很愉快。大家认为：过去简直对不起人民，办事太少了。这一次办的四百八十七件案子，如果放在机关里办，一年也办不完；悔恨以前只知“坐堂问案”、“唯我办案”的旧司法作风。由于结合发动群众办案而全面地、深入地讲解了司法政策，使直接或间接受到司法教育的群众有一万五千多人，占全区总人口百分之七十六以上。
    我深切懂得了走群众路线办案的好处。
