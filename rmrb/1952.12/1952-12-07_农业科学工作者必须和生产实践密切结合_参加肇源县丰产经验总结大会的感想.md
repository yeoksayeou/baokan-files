Agricultural Science Workers Must Closely Integrate with Production Practice
    --Thoughts on Attending the Zhaoyuan County High-Yield Experience Summary Conference
    Zhang Shiqing, Deputy Director of Keshan Agricultural Experiment Farm, Heilongjiang Province

    I attended the Zhaoyuan County High-Yield Experience Summary Conference in October this year. This conference gave me a profound education.
    The technical experience of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, seedling protection, and phased topdressing" has long been unconsciously applied by many farmers and has resulted in high yields. Unfortunately, we agricultural science and technology workers regarded it as a very "ordinary" thing. In 1950, we conducted an "equal spacing" experiment, which resulted in a yield increase of 14 to 30 percent. In 1951, we discovered in the nursery that missing seedlings and uneven seedlings were important causes of yield reduction. This year, we vigorously implemented seedling protection work in the field and also carried out thinning of millet and soybeans. However, we did not systematically summarize it as a weapon to guide mass production. Why is this? This is because we treated it lightly. The Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China was able to promote it to the people of the whole county as a way to increase production precisely because they deeply experienced in production practice that it was an important factor in increasing production and gave it sufficient attention.
    Sensitivity to new things, constant concern for the country's construction and the people's lives, are the noble qualities of communists. The Zhaoyuan County Committee, especially Comrade Ren Guodong, the County Party Secretary, possesses this quality. Therefore, they can deeply, meticulously, and patiently summarize the "ordinary" experience of the peasant masses and promote it without fear of difficulties. This not only created a large amount of wealth for the people of the whole county, but also opened up a path for increasing agricultural production in the whole province, and contributed to national construction.
    I am one of the main leaders of the agricultural experiment and research work in Keshan Agricultural Experiment Farm, Heilongjiang Province. I actually treated this kind of thing that is beneficial to the country and the people as "ordinary." The most fundamental reason is that I am not concerned enough about national construction and the lives of the masses. Therefore, I lack the sensitivity to new things and the style of going deep into reality that a Communist Party member should have. In recent years, the scientific and technical workers of our experimental farm, especially myself, have failed to go deep into the countryside and into the fields like the Zhaoyuan County Committee. Therefore, we cannot deeply understand what the main problems are in the agricultural high-yield movement. We subjectively believed that farmers already had thousands of years of experience in row spacing, sowing time, and sowing quantity, and there was no need to conduct further experimental research. In 1951, we suspended research and experiments in these areas and shifted the entire work to breeding, thinking that as long as the seed problem was solved, the fundamental problem could be solved. However, the experience of farmers in various places in creating new records of high yields in the past two years has proved that the main problem in improving agricultural technology at present is the planting method. Many facts have proved that without good planting methods, even with good seeds, it is impossible to produce more grain. In recent years, our isolated and one-sided experimental research work in some aspects has been divorced from production practice. This is the main lesson that the summary of Zhaoyuan County's high-yield experience has given me.
    In terms of scientific ideology, we also did not pay enough attention to the creation and "small" achievements of the peasants. Therefore, although we conducted some experiments on the problem of equal-distance cultivation, we failed to implement it seriously and failed to affirm it more correctly from a scientific theoretical point of view.
    This fact most powerfully proves that agricultural science work must be closely integrated with production practice in order to solve the current practical problems. Agricultural science workers must go deep into production practice in order to develop feelings with the peasants, establish a mass viewpoint, avoid regarding the creations of the masses as "ordinary," and combine the results of their own experimental research with the wisdom of the masses. Only the theories and experiences obtained on the basis of the production practice of the masses are truly scientific. And only such theories and experiences can be mastered by the broad masses and become a huge force for improving production.
    Zhaoyuan's new planting method of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, seedling protection, and phased topdressing" provides rich materials for our agricultural science work and also raises more important new topics. This planting method is suitable for all field crops in the entire province and for all regions of the province on the existing basis of Heilongjiang Province. Unfortunately, it was not widely promoted this year, and its role has not been sufficiently发挥 in the entire province. In the future, if this planting method can be combined with technologies such as land preparation and crop rotation, greater results may be obtained, and at the same time, a complete set of planting methods will appear. Our agricultural science and technology experiment and research departments must pay close attention to developing and enriching this new planting method, creating a complete set of new cultivation techniques, and constantly improving it to adapt to the gradually cooperative and collective agricultural economy.

    农业科学工作者必须和生产实践密切结合
    ——参加肇源县丰产经验总结大会的感想
    黑龙江省克山农业试验场副场长　张石清
    今年十月间我参加了肇源县丰产经验总结大会。这个大会给了我深刻的教育。
    “等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥”的技术经验，许多农民早已在不自觉地运用着，并且得到了高额产量。可惜，我们这些农业科学技术工作者把它看成了一件很“平凡”的事情。一九五○年我们曾作过“等距”试验，结果增产百分之十四到三十。一九五一年我们曾在圃场内发觉缺苗和苗不均匀是减产的重要原因。今年在场内曾大力贯彻了保苗工作，也曾作了谷子、大豆的间苗工作。但是我们并没有把它有系统地总结起来，作为指导群众生产的武器。这是为什么呢？这是因为我们把它等闲看待了。中共肇源县委能把它作为增产的门道而推行到全县人民中去，正是他们在生产实践中深刻体验到它是增产的重要因素，给它以十分重视的原故。
    对新鲜事物的敏感，时时刻刻关怀国家建设事业和人民的生活，是共产党人的高贵品质。肇源县委，尤其是县委书记任国栋同志是具备着这种品质的。因此，他们能深入地、细致地、耐心地把农民群众的“平凡”经验总结起来，并且不畏艰难地推行下去。这不但给全县人民创造了大量财富，同时也为全省农业增产开辟了道路，为国家建设贡献了力量。
    我是黑龙江省克山农业试验研究工作部门的主要负责人之一，我竟然把这种有益于国家、人民的事物
    “等闲”对待了。最根本的原因，是我对国家建设和群众生活关心不够，因此，也就缺乏一个共产党员应有的对新鲜事物的敏感和深入实际的作风。几年来，我们试验场的科学技术工作者，尤其是我，一直未能像肇源县委那样深入到农村、深入到农田里去，因此就不能深切了解在农业丰产运动中存在那些主要问题。我们曾主观认为在株行距、播种期、播种量等方面，农民已有千百年的经验，无须再作实验研究了。我们在一九五一年，中止了这些方面的研究试验，而把整个工作偏重于育种，以为只要解决了种子问题，就可以解决了根本的问题。但是，二年以来，各地农民创造高额产量新纪录的经验，却证明了目前改进农业技术中的主要问题，是种植方法问题。许多事实证明，如果没有好的种植方法，虽有好的种子，也不能多打粮食。几年来我们在某些方面孤立地片面地搞试验研究工作，和生产实践脱节了。这是肇源县丰产经验的总结给我的主要教育。
    我们在科学思想观点上，也是不够重视农民的创造和“微末”的成就的。所以关于等距栽培问题，我们虽然作了一些试验，但未能认真贯彻下去，没有把它从科学理论上更正确地肯定下来。
    这一事实最有力地证明了农业科学工作必须密切和生产实践相结合，才能解决当前的实际问题。农业科学工作者必须深入生产实践，才能和农民发生感情，才能树立起群众观点，才能不把群众的创造看作“平凡”，才能很好地把自己试验研究的成果，和群众的智慧结合起来。惟有在群众的生产实践的基础上获得的理论和经验，才是真正合乎科学的东西。也惟有这样的理论和经验，才能为广大群众所掌握，才能成为提高生产的巨大力量。
    肇源的“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥”的新种植方法，给我们的农业科学工作提供了丰富的材料，同时也提出了更重要的新课题。这个种植方法，在黑龙江省现有基础上是适合于全省所有大田作物，适合于全省各个地区的。可惜今年推广得不普遍，在全省范围内尚未足够地发挥它的作用。今后如果能把这个种植方法和整地、轮作等技术结合起来，可能得到更大的效果，同时也会出现一套完整的种植方法。我们农业科学技术试验研究部门，更须十分注意，发展和充实这个新的种植方法，创造出一套完整的新的耕作技术，并不断地提高它，以适应逐渐合作化、集体化的农业经济。
