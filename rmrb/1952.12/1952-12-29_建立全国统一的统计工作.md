    Establish a Unified National Statistical Work
    Recently, the State Statistical Bureau convened a National Statistical Work Conference, which established the guiding principle of unified leadership for national statistical work, studied the national statistical work outline and work plan for 1953, and proposed specific plans to enrich statistical institutions and strengthen statistical work. This is one of the necessary preparations for carrying out large-scale, planned economic and cultural construction.
    Our country's large-scale economic and cultural construction must be carried out in accordance with the state's overall construction policy, that is, to develop in a planned and proportional manner to ensure the continuous growth of national defense and the maximum rate of increase in national productivity. To achieve these goals, our plans must be based on the objective development of the national economy and must not be based on imagination and estimation. Therefore, planning work is inseparable from statistical work.
    Statistics are a powerful tool for understanding society. As Comrade Stalin said: "Any construction work, any state work, any planning work, is unimaginable without correct accounting. But accounting is also unimaginable without statistics. Accounting cannot move forward even a step if it is separated from statistics." (Verbatim Record of the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party) Now, when our large-scale construction begins, unimaginable chaos and losses will be caused without accurate statistics.
    Our construction plan is the program and law of action for the people of the whole country. Our plan must not remain in the office, becoming something unrelated to the execution process. Comrade Stalin said: "The formulation of a plan is only the beginning of the plan. Real plan leadership can only be unfolded after the plan is formulated, after on-the-spot inspection, and in the process of implementation, revision, and clarification of the plan." (Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party) Using methods to check the implementation of the plan, to prevent possible imbalances, to discover reserve forces, to discover backward phenomena and advanced experiences, and to combat all kinds of bureaucracy, these are important responsibilities of leading organs at all levels. However, without timely statistical work, it will not be possible to check the implementation of the plan in a timely manner, to discover and raise problems in a timely manner, and to ensure the completion of the plan. Any thought of neglecting statistical work is harmful.
    In the past three years, we have also done a lot of statistical work. Some regions and some departments have initially established a statistical system with the help of Soviet experts and have achieved certain results. However, compared with the statistical tasks put forward by the current large-scale construction, the foundation of our statistical work is still very weak and far from meeting the requirements. The development of statistical work is very unbalanced among regions and departments, and the necessary institutions have not all been established. The methods of investigation and statistics are not scientific enough, especially the lack of unified and centralized leadership nationwide. The investigation and statistical work of various regions and departments are carried out separately, so that statistical data of the same nature cannot be compared and integrated due to different observation objects, different scopes, different classification methods, different table formats and indicators, and different interpretations of indicators. Some regions and departments do not pay attention to statistical work at ordinary times, lack sound institutions and regular systems, and conduct sudden investigations when they are needed temporarily, lacking scientific and meticulous design. As a result, although they obtain data, they have no power to integrate and analyze it. This situation makes it difficult for us to further systematically understand the socio-economic situation of the country.
    In order to overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to establish unified and centralized leadership over statistical work within the national scope and to end the phenomenon of each doing its own thing and arbitrarily issuing forms. We have established the State Statistical Bureau, and all basic statistical work on finance, economy, culture, education, health, and social conditions should be led by it. All basic statistical work stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau must be guaranteed to be completed by statistical institutions and business departments at all levels.
    In order to complete the state's statistical tasks and meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, all regions and departments must transfer cadres to enrich statistical institutions and strengthen statistical work. In particular, all business departments must quickly and practically establish statistical work. At present, some regions and some business departments still do not sufficiently recognize the importance of statistical work. Some agencies do not establish regular statistical work and grab materials everywhere when they need them. Some agencies arbitrarily transfer trained statistical cadres to other jobs, while stuffing some cadres who are not suitable for statistical work into statistical departments. Some agencies do not comply with the deadline for submitting statistical data, thinking that it does not matter sooner or later. Some agencies transfer statistical personnel to crash other jobs, causing statistical work to stagnate. Some agencies adopt an irresponsible attitude towards statistical data, stamp them as usual, and send them out casually, and they themselves do not believe these data. These phenomena must be resolutely eliminated in the future.
    We require all business departments to gradually strengthen statistical work in the future in conjunction with the establishment and improvement of various management systems to ensure the timeliness and accuracy of statistical data. In particular, it is necessary to pay attention to the statistical work of grassroots enterprises and institutions, sort out original records, and quickly and effectively enrich statistical work institutions, and equip them with the necessary number of competent cadres, in order to ensure the correct and timely completion of the state's statistical work tasks and meet business needs.

### 建立全国统一的统计工作

    建立全国统一的统计工作
    最近国家统计局召开了全国统计工作会议，确定了全国统计工作统一领导的方针，研究了一九五三年的全国统计工作纲要和工作计划，提出了充实统计机构和加强统计工作的具体方案。这是开展大规模的、有计划的经济和文化建设所必需的准备工作之一。
    我国大规模的经济和文化建设，必须按照国家总的建设方针进行，即有计划地按比例地发展，以保证国防力量的不断增长和国家生产力的最大速度的提高。要发挥这些作用，我们的计划就必须依据人民经济的客观发展情况来制订，而决不能凭想像和估计来制订。因此，计划工作是和统计工作分不开的。
    统计是认识社会的强有力的工具。正如斯大林同志所说：“任何建设工作，任何国家工作，任何计划工作，若是没有正确的核算是不可想像的。但核算如果没有统计也是不可想像的。核算如果离开统计，则一步也不能前进。”（俄共第十一次代表大会报告速记）现在，当我国的大规模建设开始的时候，如果没有精确的统计数字，就会造成难以想像的混乱和损失。
    我们的建设计划是全国人民行动的纲领和法律。我们的计划决不能停留在办公室中，成为与执行进程无关的东西。斯大林同志说：“计划的制订仅仅是计划的开始，真正的计划领导只有在制订计划之后，在实地检查之后，在计划的实现、修正、与明确的过程中才能展开。”（联共第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论）用检查计划执行情况的办法，来防止可能发生的不平衡现象，来发现后备力量，来发现落后的现象和先进的经验，来与各种各样的官僚主义作斗争，这些都是各级领导机关的重要职责。但是，如果没有及时的统计工作，就不能及时地检查计划的执行情况，不能及时发现问题和提出问题，就不能保证计划的完成。任何忽视统计工作的思想都是有害的。
    过去三年来，我们也曾做过不少统计工作。某些地区、某些部门，并已在苏联专家帮助下，初步建立了统计制度，有一定的成绩。但是，同目前大规模建设所提出的统计任务相比，我们统计工作的基础还是很薄弱的，远远不能满足要求。各地区、各部门间，统计工作的发展是很不平衡的，应有的机构并不是都已建立起来了。调查统计的方法也不够科学，尤其是缺乏全国统一集中的领导，各地区、各部门的调查统计工作分散进行，以致同一性质的统计资料，由于观察对象不同、范围不同、分类方法不同、表式指标不同、指标的解释不同，就不能互相比较和综合。有些地区和部门，平时不重视统计工作，缺乏健全的机构和经常的制度，临时需要，突击调查，缺乏科学的细密的设计，结果虽然弄到资料，却没有力量加以综合和分析。这种情况使我们对于全国的社会经济情况进一步系统的了解产生了困难。
    为了克服这种缺点，必须对于全国范围内的统计工作，建立起统一集中的领导，终止那种各自为政、滥发表格的现象。我们已经建立了国家统计局，所有财政、经济、文化、教育、卫生及社会情况的基本统计工作，都应该由它来负责领导。凡国家统计局所规定的基本统计工作，各级统计机构及各业务部门必须首先保证其完成。
    为了完成国家的统计任务，以适应大规模经济建设的需要，各地区、各部门必须抽调干部，充实统计机构，加强统计工作。特别是各业务部门必须迅速地把统计工作切实建立起来。目前，某些地区和某些业务部门对于统计工作的重要性仍然认识不够。有些机关不建立经常的统计工作，需要材料时就到处乱抓。有些机关把受过训练的统计干部随意抽调到别的工作岗位上去，而把一些不适合统计工作的干部塞到统计部门中来。有些机关不遵守统计资料报送的期限，认为早些晚些都没有关系。有些机关把统计人员调去突击其他工作，使统计工作陷于停顿。有些机关对统计资料采取漫不负责的态度，照例盖章，随便送出，连自己都不相信这些资料。这些现象，今后必须坚决予以肃清。
    我们要求各业务部门，今后必须结合各种管理制度的建立和改进，逐步加强统计工作，以保证统计资料的及时与正确。特别是要重视基层企业单位的统计工作，整理原始纪录，迅速地切实地充实统计工作机构，配备必要数量的能够胜任的干部，才能保证正确地、及时地完成国家的统计工作任务和满足业务上的需要。
