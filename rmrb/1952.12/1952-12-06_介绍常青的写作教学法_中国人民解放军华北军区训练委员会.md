Introducing Chang Qing's Writing Pedagogy
Training Committee of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

Chang Qing's writing pedagogy is a new creation in writing instruction. It is not only greatly helpful for language teaching in the military but also beneficial for general accelerated literacy classes. Chang Qing's writing pedagogy can be roughly divided into four implementation steps: The first step focuses on relieving students of all concerns and constraints, the second step is "I write about myself," the third step is "Turning outward," and the last step is consolidating and improving teaching results.

Why can't or don't worker-peasant cadres and soldiers write?

Chang Qing believes that worker-peasant cadres and soldiers have the following characteristics in writing:

First, after mastering a certain number of characters and words and receiving a certain amount of language education, their reading ability is generally higher, but their writing ability is relatively lower. Therefore, they urgently need to improve their writing ability.

Second, our cadres and soldiers have "rich life experiences and have tasted all the bitterness and sweetness." Therefore, there is a wealth of material to write about. Moreover, through the education of the Party and the tempering of revolutionary struggle, their class viewpoints are relatively clear, and their ability to analyze problems is also relatively strong. It is entirely possible for them to write works with profound ideological content.

Third, although our cadres and soldiers have difficulty writing, they speak clearly and logically. When they talk about things they have experienced or feel deeply about, they have a beginning and an end, focus, and are vivid and concrete. If they write it down, it would be a good article.

Our cadres and soldiers have the above-mentioned favorable conditions in writing, but why can't or don't they write? This is because they have many obstacles and difficulties in writing, as well as great concerns and constraints. The main ones are: First, they don't know what to write. Second, even with material, they don't know how to write well. Especially those who have written articles and listened to teachers talk about writing techniques are afraid of this and that as soon as they pick up a pen. They are afraid of focusing on the beginning, the ending, the structure, the levels, the prominence of the central idea, the topic, being verbose, the genre, and being concise. Some people say, "As soon as the teacher talks about how to start, end, paragraph, and structure, I don't dare to write." The more they try to write according to the requirements, the less they can find a way in, and the more constrained they become. Third, because teachers require that there be no typos, no inappropriate use of words, and no ungrammatical sentences in the articles, they often get stuck because of a few characters or words after starting to write, looking up dictionaries everywhere and asking people for help. They write and cross out, and rewrite after crossing out, which interrupts their train of thought and makes it impossible to continue writing.

Chang Qing summarizes these difficulties that students have in writing and calls them "Ten Fears" and "Three Barriers" ("Three Barriers" are "Content Barrier," "Form Barrier," and "Word Barrier"). These difficulties hinder the students' thinking, making them think that only knowledgeable people or writers can write, losing their courage and confidence in writing. Chang Qing believes that the main reason why students fall into this difficulty and cannot break through it is that teachers have deviations from reality and stick to conventions in their teaching methods. To overcome these deviations, teachers must closely connect with reality, grasp the characteristics of students and the basic laws of writing, dare to break through old conventions, and improve writing teaching methods. To do this, they must first help everyone break through the "Ten Fears," overcome the "Three Barriers," remove the various constraints of the students, eliminate their various concerns, and build their confidence in writing.

Conduct in-depth mobilization to relieve students' ideological concerns in writing

Before the mobilization, the teacher must do preparatory work. They must consciously publicize the benefits of Chang Qing's writing pedagogy in the students to give them some ideological preparation in advance; at the same time, they must specifically and in detail understand the students' backgrounds, experiences, and learning situations to find out what their requirements, difficulties, and concerns are in writing. This way, the mobilization can be targeted. In addition, they must cultivate typical examples and collect examples from other places to persuade everyone with facts during the mobilization.

During the formal mobilization, the teacher must closely connect with the actual situation of the students according to the requirements of breaking the "Ten Fears" and overcoming the "Three Barriers," to achieve: First, break the mysterious view of writing, and make every student understand: writing is just using square characters to express their thoughts and feelings, just like we usually use speech to express our thoughts and feelings, and it is not mysterious. Second, based on everyone's personal experience, explain the pain of not being able to write, and encourage everyone to be determined to learn to write. Third, compare the examples of Gao Yubao and other students in other places with the life struggle experiences of the students in this class, and explain that everyone has a lot to write about. The reason why they couldn't write before was because they didn't find the trick. Fourth, introduce new methods, and use examples to illustrate that using the "I write about myself" method and writing about their own things in their own words, they don't have to worry about not having anything to write or not being able to write. In addition, carry out "speaking writing" activities, telling everyone to write as they speak, and not to be bound by the beginning, ending, and other forms; learn to use the "jump obstacles and patch holes" method, and don't be afraid of the obstacles of unfamiliar words. Explain that as long as they do this, they can overcome the "Three Barriers" and find the trick to writing articles. Then, read some articles written by some comrades using the new method to everyone on the spot; and let the writers report on the writing process and their feelings about the new method; then, conduct group discussions, and the teacher consciously goes deep into the group to see what other concerns and difficulties everyone has, and conducts education further, to ensure that everyone is taught well and that everyone quickly learns to write.

After such mobilization, students can generally break through the "Ten Fears," overcome the "Three Barriers," and set off a wave of "speaking writing" and writing. Some units, after carrying out the above work, many students reacted: At first, they thought that the new writing teaching method was not the old one, but after listening to the teacher talk about breaking the "Ten Fears," it was like removing shackles, and this time it spoke to the hearts of our worker-peasant comrades.

"I Write About Myself"

What is "I write about myself"? It is to let students write about things they have personally experienced. This is the first step to open up thinking and carry out writing activities. But "I write about myself" is not writing an autobiography, nor is it writing a military registration form; it is to choose the most exciting, painful, or unforgettable things they have experienced to write about. When writing, it is not the teacher who gives the topic, but the students who write freely. This allows the students to write what they want to write the most.

After the "I write about myself" activity begins, it will immediately set off a writing craze, with students writing about the suffering in the old society or the happiness in the new society. Words that have been accumulated in the heart for many years, things that have been remembered in the heart, are all expressed at once. Some comrades, after mastering the new writing method, said: "This matter has been stuck in my stomach for more than ten years, and today I finally have the opportunity to write it out!" Some students couldn't help but shed tears when writing about the painful parts, and wanted to jump up when writing about the happy parts. Generally speaking, the things written by students from worker-peasant backgrounds have clear class viewpoints, lively vocabulary, generally smooth sentences, and a central idea in the article. Although the teacher did not give the topic, the titles are generally very eye-catching, such as one student's title "Money to Celebrate the New Year, No Money to Pass the Barrier," and another student's title "I Rode on the Horse to Join the Army." After the students' thinking is opened up, it is like a mountain torrent pouring down, unstoppable; some comrades even drafted more than ten topics in just a few minutes, preparing to write them one by one.

Using the "I write about myself" method is not only to solve the problem of writing materials for students, but also to find out the development law of students' writing in the writing process, so as to gradually enable students to understand the essentials of writing. This does not contradict breaking the "Ten Fears." We oppose using writing methods to bind comrades from worker-peasant backgrounds from the beginning, but we are by no means denying writing methods; on the contrary, after the students have established confidence in writing, we should enable them to gradually understand and master writing methods in the practice of writing.

When the "I write about myself" activity begins, the only requirement is for students to "write about one thing in their own words." Generally speaking, the first article written by students is vivid and concrete, but does not grasp the key points. Therefore, in the second composition, it should be proposed that the article should have key points. Chang Qing once used a clapper talk to explain what the key point is: "No matter how long or short the process of an event is, it must have key points when writing. The key point is very simple, it is the crux of the matter. The tense ones - head sweats, the painful ones - heart aches, the happy ones - want to jump up, the angry ones - gnash their teeth. This is the key point of the article." After such enlightenment, students can generally consciously grasp the key points in the second composition, but often write the key points and the process equally long. Therefore, in the third composition, it must be proposed that "the key point is long and the process is short." In order to enable everyone to gradually master the method of writing, it is necessary to conduct homework comments and lecture reading texts. Because students have gained some experience in a large amount of writing, coupled with familiar and intimate materials, they can understand the teacher's explanation of writing methods and can apply it in writing.

In the specific implementation of the "I write about myself" teaching activities, the following basic methods can be adopted:

First, carry out "speaking writing" activities. "Speaking writing" can enable students to achieve consistency between language and writing, and can inspire students to better think and organize their thoughts. Some students said: "After speaking writing, I pick up the pen and write, the words in my heart urge the tip of the pen, I only hate that the tip of the pen writes slowly." How to "speak"? The clapper talk says: "First think about one thing, say it to yourself once; I tell others, others listen and make suggestions; then write the article, write it in one breath and read it again." But the use of the "speaking writing" method is not always smooth. Some people always feel that "their own words are common people's language, and cannot be used in articles," so they reluctantly learn elegant sentences, resulting in the phenomenon of misusing words and hindering the smooth expression of their thoughts and feelings. Therefore, it must be emphasized to "write about your own things in your own words." At the same time, print out articles that are written vividly and concretely for everyone to read, so that everyone believes that good articles can be written in their own words; and the phenomenon of misusing words must be corrected. This way, everyone can say many touching words. For example, some have said: "The rich man wearing new clothes is like a paper figure"; some use "a rotten radish planted upside down - big on top and small on the bottom" to describe the landlord's false fatness. Some said when describing the life of working for the landlord: "The rooster crows once is not early to get up, and sleeping after the play is not late." These vivid words can be introduced in the comments. Facts have proved that whoever "speaks writing" well writes both quickly and well. But some people are reluctant to "speak writing" at the beginning, and just bury their heads in hard writing, resulting in being slow and ungrammatical, so it is necessary to repeatedly publicize the benefits of "speaking writing."

In the "speaking writing" activity, counseling and mutual assistance are the most important. When conducting mutual assistance, two or three people should be grouped together according to the principle of voluntariness; teachers, counselors, and learning group leaders should be closely combined and divide the work; the comrades who counsel and participate in mutual assistance should follow the speaker's mood, follow their train of thought, give specific enlightenment, and help him clearly recognize the key points.

Second, "jump obstacles" and "patch holes": In order to ensure the smooth progress of writing, when picking up the pen to write after "speaking writing," the method of "jumping obstacles" should be used. That is, when encountering words that you don't know how to write, write phonetic symbols or leave them blank, and continue writing. Don't stop. After the entire article is written, go back and "patch holes" (correct typos and add words that you don't know how to write). The method of "jumping obstacles" and "patching holes" can ensure the smooth development of students' thinking, save writing time, enable students to increase their knowledge of words, and reduce typos.

Third, "typo sweep" and "new word blossoms": In order to reduce typos and expand the meaning of words, the methods of "typo sweep" and "new word blossoms" can be adopted. "Typo sweep" is to concentrate the typos that most people commonly use, explain them in class in a blitz manner, and educate everyone to use words correctly. "New word blossoms" is to let everyone understand that one word has many uses, such as the word "误" (wù, mistake) can be used as the "误" (wù) in "错误" (cuòwù, mistake), "耽误" (dānwù, delay), and "误会" (wùhuì, misunderstanding), and to enable students to distinguish words with similar sounds and similar shapes, such as "悟" (wù, realize) and "误" (wù, mistake). When using this method, you must pay attention to preventing students from only wanting to learn "new word blossoms" and not wanting to learn the text again, or asking for the tendency of "chain blossoms."

Fourth, explanation and reading: In the language teaching stage focusing on solving writing problems, explanation and reading should be carried out according to the requirements of writing. The purpose is to enable students to understand writing methods, increase knowledge of characters and words, and enrich sentence knowledge. The selection of materials must be cautious and must conform to the students' thoughts and feelings and actual level. Articles of the same nature should be concentrated and explained or read. The scope of explanation and reading is not only limited to model essays, but also the best homework written by students in the "I write about myself" activity should be compiled and printed for everyone to read (especially at the beginning). This can encourage their learning emotions and build their learning confidence.

Fifth, modification and commenting on homework: Homework can be modified in two ways: teacher focused modification and student mutual assistance modification. The method of students modifying each other's homework can not only solve some difficulties for teachers in modifying homework, but also enable students to learn from each other and improve their reading and writing abilities. Homework comments should be based on writing requirements, "focus on key points, involve all aspects," and adopt the method of praise as the main method. Such comments can solve major problems, solve the problems of most people, and increase everyone's confidence. For example, the current writing requirement is "short process, long key point," then in the comments, we must firmly grasp this point, and point out what advantages and disadvantages everyone has in this aspect, and cite everyone's homework as examples. This will gradually solve the problem of how to grasp the key points, so as to gradually improve everyone's writing level.

"Turning Outward"

In the "I write about myself" activity, the writing scope of some students has gradually expanded, and they have begun to "turn outward." At this time, the teacher should seize the opportunity to propose the method of "turning outward" so that everyone can "go from near to far," "from inside to outside," and "from the past to the present" to write about familiar things around them and other things. There is a basis for making this suggestion. Because:

First, after the "I write about myself" stage, students have built confidence, opened up their thinking, and improved their analytical observation ability and writing methods. They have new feelings about the current work, life, study, and the people and things around them, and feel that there are many things to write about; second, the average comrade has already felt the narrow scope of writing in the process of "I write about myself" and naturally asks to "turn outward." Therefore, "turning outward" is in line with the development law of students' writing. For example, some students said: "When I started 'I write about myself,' I felt that the scope was quite broad, but after writing for a period of time, I felt that the scope was small. Now that I turn outward, there is something to write again." "Writing about your own things first is easy to write. In the process of writing about your own things, you improve your writing methods and analytical abilities, and master the essence of the problem. It is not difficult to write outward again."

But there are difficulties in "turning outward" at the beginning. Some people say that "turning outward" is not writing ready-made materials, and it takes more effort than "I write about myself," so they lack confidence. At this time, it is necessary to print out articles written by some comrades about things outside themselves and let everyone read and study to see how others write. In terms of writing content, the teacher cannot immediately give topics to limit, but still asks everyone to write about things they are familiar with, and mobilize everyone to use their brains more and analyze the materials well. When conducting this mobilization work, a clapper talk can be adopted. This clapper talk is: "Materials are like a pile of grain, the brain is like a millstone, to grind the grain into flour, the brain must turn three times." In addition, we should induce everyone to read more extracurricular reading materials.

Some people say: "I write about myself" is a line, and "turning outward" is a puddle, and the materials cannot be organized. Therefore, in terms of writing methods, we must connect with reality and propose the method of "lining up" to help students overcome the difficulty of organizing materials. There are several steps to "lining up": The first is to "find the leader"; the second is to "report the number"; the third is to "check the number of people." For example: When a comrade was writing an article on "The Great Motherland," he found two leaders. The first was industrial construction. He put the railway, the factory, and Zhao Guoyou in the line of industrial construction. After standing in line, he reported the number to see if everyone he wanted to find had come. The second leader was agricultural construction. Cotton, Li Shunda, and Liang Jun stood in this team; but in the check of the number of people, it was found that Hao Jianxiu was also standing here, so he immediately asked her to stand in the team of industrial construction. After lining up like this, the paragraphs are clear, the levels are clear, and you can start writing. In order to make everyone clear about the problem of paragraphing, the following clapper talk can be used to explain: "Ships have docks, cars have stations, writing articles needs paragraphs; paragraphing is not looking for trouble, nor is it for beauty, it is for writing clearly and reading conveniently."

In the process of "I write about myself," a specific fact is generally used to explain a problem, which is relatively easy. After "turning outward," a problem often needs to be explained from many aspects. In order to enable students to still write concretely and prevent emptiness, everyone should be taught to use facts to explain problems. This way, they can write quickly, write a lot, write concretely, and write clearly. In the process of "I write about myself," students generally write narrative essays. When turning outward, due to the expansion of scope and the increase in content, the style has changed, and they can write explanatory essays. In the past, a problem was explained through one thing, but now it can be explained from several aspects.

How to Consolidate Teaching Results

After teaching activities such as "I write about myself" and "turning outward," most comrades can write articles of about a thousand words. They are generally able to grasp the key points and explain the problem concretely, and they can also paragraph, and the sentences are relatively smooth. A few comrades with poor levels, although they have initially learned to paragraph and can grasp the key points, often write insufficiently concretely. In terms of reading, it takes seven to eight minutes to read popular articles of about a thousand words; they can say the central idea, but they do not read fluently enough. At this time, the main problems of the students are: the scope of writing cannot be extended to all aspects; the sentences are verbose, and the basic knowledge of vocabulary and sentences is not rich; they urgently need to talk and read more to enrich their knowledge. Because they feel that "their articles are not as powerful as the books, and not as simple and clear as the books," the number of people reading books and newspapers during extracurricular activities or classroom breaks will inevitably increase significantly. Therefore, the focus of teaching at this stage is to consolidate the teaching results of the first stage. Through explaining and reading model essays, reading a large number of popular books and newspapers, and other activities, students can obtain more vocabulary and basic sentence knowledge, develop the habit of writing and reading, thereby further expanding their horizons and improving their ability to think, read, and write. In the specific implementation of teaching, the following basic methods can be adopted:

First, educate students to develop the habit of writing and expand the scope of writing. How to develop the habit of writing?

(1) Let every comrade understand the meaning of the sentence "There are articles everywhere if you pay attention." After everyone understands this point, they feel that there are really too many things to write about. For example, some comrades saw many new scenes on the train and wanted to write articles.

(2) Combined with a large amount of reading materials, advocate writing after reading. This method of combining writing and reading can not only enable students to better digest reading materials, but also help them practice writing.

(3) Advocate "old turning into new," modifying articles you have written in the past. In modifying articles they have written in the past, students will see the shortcomings of their past writing and realize that today's writing level has improved.

(4) Conduct short-time writing, allowing students to exercise their thinking ability and rapid writing ability.

(5) Advocate writing a large number of diaries and wall newspaper drafts.

(6) Practice writing practical documents in combination with actual needs. Such as: practice writing letters, taking classroom notes, taking meeting minutes, and practicing writing relatively simple reports, summaries, newsletters, etc. Make everyone truly feel that writing is very useful for current work and study.

Second, organize sentences. Because students' basic knowledge of vocabulary and sentences is still not rich, and there are many grammatical errors in ordinary speech, in writing, there are problems such as repetitive and verbose sentences, incomplete sentences, ungrammatical sentences, and inappropriate use of words. Therefore, it is necessary to cultivate students' ability to organize sentences. But this does not mean giving students a set of grammar revisions, but rather bringing up and correcting the grammatical errors that students commonly make in ordinary speech and writing. The following methods should be used when organizing sentences:

(1) Organize by category, so that the problems are concentrated and the impression is deep.

(2) Organize specifically, not just mention a few words casually. (3) Connect with life, don't just circle around the homework. (4) Do homework to organize sentences. After the classroom explanation, give questions for everyone to modify, or check their own homework. This way, everyone develops the habit of organizing sentences. (5) In organizing sentences, we must strengthen the learning of certain sentences in the text, so that everyone can enrich their knowledge of sentences in reading and learn scientific and beautiful sentences.

Third, strengthen the activities of explaining and reading reading materials, and develop reading habits. At this stage, the proportion of text explanation and reading should be appropriately increased. For key lessons, it is required to read carefully; and assign auxiliary lessons for everyone to read and study, so that students can further understand writing methods and improve reading ability. In addition, guide everyone to read a large number of reading materials. First of all, according to the focus of teaching, specify reading materials (learning groups should be guided to organize the reading and discussion of these materials). The teacher should explain the purpose and requirements of reading in advance. After the group reports the results and questions of reading discussion, the teacher concentrates them and conducts answers and comments. Furthermore, it is necessary to advocate reading newspapers and popular reading materials frequently. Teachers and comrades in charge of book work in the club should regularly introduce readable materials in newspapers and popular books and magazines according to everyone's level, so that everyone can read freely in their spare time. Extracurricular activities can also be adopted to organize everyone to read newspapers, popular works, short newsletters, etc.

    介绍常青的写作教学法
    中国人民解放军华北军区训练委员会
    常青的写作教学法，是写作教学上的一个新创造。它不仅对部队的语文教学工作有很大的帮助，就是对一般速成识字班的语文教学也是有帮助的。常青写作教学法大体上可以分作四个实施步骤：第一个步骤的教学重点在于解除学员的一切顾虑和束缚，第二个步骤是“我写我”，第三个步骤是“向外转”，最后一个步骤是巩固和提高教学成果。
    为什么工农出身的干部、
    战士不能写、不敢写
    常青认为，工农出身的干部、战士在写作上有如下几个特点：
    一、他们在掌握一定数量的字、词，接受一定的语文教育之后，阅读能力一般是比较高的，写作能力却比较低，因此，他们迫切要求提高写作能力。
    二、我们的干部、战士，“生活丰富经验多，苦辣酸甜都尝过”。因而有极丰富的材料可写。而且，经过了党的教育和革命斗争的锻炼，他们的阶级观点比较明确，分析问题的能力也比较强，完全有可能写出具有深刻思想性的作品。
    三、我们的干部、战士，虽然写起来很困难，但说起来却头头是道。他们对于自己经历过的或感受比较深的事物，说起来有头有尾，有重点，而且生动具体，如果用文字把它写出来，就是好文章。
    我们的干部、战士在写作上既有上述有利条件，但为什么不能写、不敢写？这是因为他们在写作上有许多障碍和困难，还有很大的顾虑和束缚。其中主要的是：第一，他们不知写什么好。第二，有了材料，他们不知怎样写才好，特别是那些写过文章、听教员讲过文章作法的人，一提笔就怕这怕那，他们怕讲究开头、怕讲究结尾、怕讲究结构、怕讲究层次、怕讲究中心突出、怕命题、怕囉嗦、怕讲究体裁、怕讲究短小精悍、怕生字生词。有的人说：“教员一讲如何开头、结尾、分段、结构，我就不敢下笔了。”他们越想照讲过的要领写，越摸不到门路，越是束手束脚。第三，由于教员要求写文章不要有错别字，不要用词不当，不要语句不通，所以他们动笔以后，往往因为少数字、词的阻拦，到处查字典、到处问人，写了涂掉，涂了重写，这样思路就被打断了，无法写下去。
    常青综合学员在写作上的这些难点，名之为“十怕”、“三关”（“三关”即是“内容关”、“形式关”、“字词关”）。这些难关阻碍着学员的思路，使他们以为只有有学问的人或者作家才能写作，对写作丧失了勇气和信心。常青认为：使学员陷入这种困难而又老是闯不出来的主要原因，是教员们在教学方法上存在着脱离实际和墨守成规的偏向。要克服这些偏向，教员必须紧密地联系实际，抓住学员的特点和写作的基本规律，敢于冲破旧有的成规，改进写作的教学方法。为此须首先帮助大家打破“十怕”，闯出“三关”，解除学员的各种束缚，扫除他们的种种顾虑，使他们树立写作的信心。
    进行深入动员，解除学员
    在写作上的思想顾虑
    在动员之前，教员要做好准备工作。要有意识地在学员中概略地宣传常青写作教学法的好处，使学员先在思想上有所准备；同时要具体、详细地了解学员的出身、经历和学习的情况，弄清楚他们对写作有什么要求、困难、顾虑。这样在动员时才能有的放矢。另外，要培养典型并搜集其他地方的实例，以便在动员中以事实来说服大家。
    在正式动员时，教员要根据打破“十怕”和闯“三关”的要求，密切联系学员的实际情况，做到：一、打破对写作的神秘观点，使每一个学员明白：写作只是用方块字来表达自己的思想感情，就跟我们平常用说话表达自己的思想感情那样，并不神秘。二、根据大家的切身体验，说明不会写作的痛苦，激励大家决心学会写作。三、以高玉宝和其他地方的学员的实例对照本班学员的生活斗争经历，说明大家可写的东西多得很，以前写不出来，是因为没有找到窍门。四、介绍新的方法，以实例说明采用“我写我”的方法，用自己的话写自己的事，就不愁没有什么可写，也不愁写不出来。另外，开展“说文”活动，告诉大家怎么说就怎么写，不要受开头、结尾等等形式的束缚；学会用“跳障碍补窟窿”的方法，就不怕生字难词的阻拦。说明只要这样做，就可以闯出“三关”，找到写文章的窍门。接着就把某些同志用新方法写出来的文章，当堂念给大家听；并让写的同志，报告写作的经过及对于新方法的感想；然后分小组进行讨论，教员则有意识地深入小组看大家还有什么顾虑和困难，再深入一步地进行教育，保证一定把大家教好，使大家迅速学会写作。
    经过这样的动员，大体上就可以使学员打破“十怕”闯出“三关”，掀起“说文”和写作的热潮。有的单位在进行了上述工作以后，不少学员反应：最初以为新的写作教学方法还不是老一套，后来听了教员讲打破“十怕”，真像给自己去了枷锁，这一下讲到我们工农同志的心里了。
    “我　写　我”
    什么是“我写我”呢？就是让学员们从自己亲身经历的事物写起。这是打开思路、开展写作活动的第一步。但是“我写我”不是写自传，也不是写军人登记表；而是选择自己经历中最兴奋或最痛苦或最难忘的事情来写。在写的时候，不是由教员出题，而是让学员自由写。这样才能使学员把自己最想写的写出来。
    “我写我”的活动开始后，立刻会掀起写作热潮，学员或者写在旧社会的苦，或者写在新社会的乐。多少年积在内心的话，记在心里的事，一下子吐露出来了。有的同志在掌握了新的写作方法以后说：“这事在肚里蹩了十几年了，今天才有机会写出来！”有的学员写到痛苦处不禁流了泪，写到高兴处则想跳起来。一般说，工农出身的学员写出来的东西，阶级观点是明确的，语汇是生动活泼的，语句大体是通顺的，文章也是有中心的。教员虽然没有出题，但一般标题却非常醒目，如有的学员写的标题是“有钱过年，无钱过关”，有的学员写的是“我骑上了参军马”。学员的思路打开之后，有似山洪倾泻，不可遏止；有的同志甚至在十几分钟之内，拟定了上十个题目，预备一个一个地写。
    运用“我写我”的方法，不仅是为了解决学员的写作材料问题，同时也是为了要在学员的写作过程中，找出学员写作的发展规律，以便据以逐步使学员领会写作的要领。这和打破“十怕”并不矛盾。我们反对一开始就用写作方法来束缚工农出身的同志，但决不是否定写作方法；恰恰相反，在学员们树立写作信心以后，我们是应该使学员在写作的实践中，逐步领会、掌握写作方法的。
    当“我写我”的活动开始的时候，只是要求学员
    “用自己的话写一件事”。一般地说，学员写的第一篇文章，都是写得生动具体的，但抓不住重点。因此，在第二次作文时，就应该提出写文章要有重点。常青曾用快板说明什么是重点：“一件事的经过不论长短，写来一定要有重点。提起重点很简单，就是这事的节骨眼。紧张的——头出汗，痛苦的——心发酸，高兴的——直想跳，愤恨的——咬牙关。这就是文章的重点。”经过这样的启发，学员在第二次作文时一般都能有意识地掌握重点，但往往把重点和过程写得一般长，因此在第三次作文中必须提出“重点长过程短”的要求。为了使大家逐步掌握写作的方法，要进行作业讲评和讲读课文。由于学员在大量写作中，已有了一些经验，加之材料熟悉亲切，因此教师讲解写作方法时，他们都能领会，并能够在写作中运用它。
    在具体进行“我写我”的教学活动时，可采用下述几种基本方法：
    一、开展“说文”活动。“说文”可以使学员在写作时达到语文一致，并可以启发学员更好地思索和组织思想。有的学员说：“说文以后提笔写，心里的话儿催笔尖，只嫌笔尖写的慢。”怎样“说”呢？用快板来说就是：“先想一件事，自己说一遍；我对别人讲，别人听了提意见；回头就写文，一气写成再念念。”但“说文”方法的运用并不是一帆风顺的。有的人总觉得“自己的话是老百姓腔，上不得文章”，就勉强去学斯文的句子，结果便发生乱用词句的现象，妨碍了顺畅地表达自己的思想感情。因此必须强调“用自己的话写自己的事”。同时要把写得生动具体的文章印出来叫大家读，使大家相信用自己的话可以写成好文章；而乱用词句的现象必须加以纠正。这样大家就可以说出许多动人的话。如有的曾说：“老财穿上新衣服真像纸扎的人”；有的用“糠了的萝?倒栽着——上大下小”来形容地主的虚胖。有的在述说替地主扛活的生活时说：“鸡叫一遍不算起的早，戏完睡觉不算迟。”这些生动的话可在讲评中加以介绍。事实证明，谁“说文”说得好就写得又快又好。但也有的开始不愿“说文”，只是埋头硬写，结果是又慢又不通顺，因此必须反复宣传“说文”的好处。
    在“说文”活动中，辅导和互助工作最为重要。进行互助时要根据自愿的原则把两三人编成一组；教员、辅导员和学习组长要密切结合，分工掌握；辅导和参加互助的同志要跟着说者的心情走，顺从其思路，具体地给予启发，帮助他明确认识重点。
    二、“跳障碍”和“补窟窿”：为了保证写作的顺畅进行，在“说文”之后动笔写时，就要运用
    “跳障碍”的方法。就是遇见不会写的字词，写上注音符号或空下来，继续写下去，不要停，待全篇文章写成后再回头“补窟窿”（改正错别字和补添不会写的字）。“跳障碍”和“补窟窿”的办法，可以保证学员思路的顺畅发展，节省写作的时间，使学员增识字词，减少错别字。
    三、“错别字大扫除”，“生字开花”：为了减少错别字，扩大字义，可以采用“错别字大扫除”和“生字开花”的办法。“错别字大扫除”，就是把多数人常用的错别字集中起来，在课堂上用突击办法加以讲解，教育大家正确地使用字、词。“生字开花”，就是要让大家懂得一个字有许多用法，如“误”字可作为“错误”“耽误”“误会”的
    “误”字用，并使学员区别音相近形相似的字如：
    “悟”和“误”。在运用这种方法时，必须注意防止学员只愿学“生字开花”不愿再学课文，或要求
    “连环开花”的偏向。
    四、讲解和阅读：在以解决写作问题为重点的语文教学阶段中，讲解和阅读都要根据写作的要求来进行。其目的是为了使学员领会写作方法，增识字、词，丰富语句知识。材料的选择，必须慎重，要切合学员的思想感情和实际水平。要将同类性质的文章，集中起来讲或读。讲和读的范围，不仅仅限于范文，也要把学员在“我写我”的活动中写的最好的作业编印出来，组织大家阅读（特别是在开始的时候）。这可以鼓励他们的学习情绪，使他们树立学习信心。
    五、作业的修改和讲评：作业的修改可以采用教员重点修改和学员互助修改两种办法。学员互助修改作业的办法，不仅可以解决教员修改作业的某些困难，并且能使学员们互相学习，提高阅读写作能力。作业讲评应根据写作要求，“抓住重点，涉及全面”，采取表扬为主的办法。这样的讲评，才能解决重大问题，解决多数人的问题，提高大家的信心。例如，当前的写作要求是“过程短，重点长”，那么在讲评中就要紧紧抓住这一点，指明大家在这一方面有那些优点，有那些缺点，并引证大家的作业作例子。这样逐步解决如何抓住重点的问题，以逐步提高大家的写作水平。
    “向　外　转”
    在“我写我”的活动中，一部分学员的写作范围逐渐扩大了，开始“向外转”。这时，教员就应抓紧时机提出“向外转”的方法，使大家“由近而远”、
    “由内而外”、“由过去到现在”，写自己周围熟悉的事物和其他的事情。这样提是有根据的。因为：
    一、经过了“我写我”的阶段，学员树立了信心，打开了思路，提高了分析观察能力和写作方法。他们对当前的工作、生活、学习和周围的人和事，有了新的感觉，觉得可写的东西是很多的；二、一般同志在“我写我”的过程中，已经感到写作范围的狭小，很自然地要求“向外转”。因此，“向外转”是合乎学员写作的发展规律的。例如有的学员说：“开始‘我写我’时，觉得范围挺宽广，写一个时期就觉得范围小了，现在向外转就又有可写的了。”“先写自己的事，容易写，在写自己的事当中提高了写作方法和分析能力，掌握了问题本质，再向外写也就不难了。”
    但是一开始“向外转”，并不是没有困难的。有人说：“向外转”不是写现成材料，比“我写我”费劲因而信心不足。这时就必须把某些同志写身外之事的文章印出来，让大家阅读研究，看人家是怎样写的。在写作内容上，教员不能马上出题限定，还是要求大家写自己熟悉的事物，并动员大家多用脑子，好好分析材料。在进行这种动员工作时，有
    一首快板是可以采用的。这首快板是：“材料好比一堆谷，脑子好比一盘磨，要把谷子磨成面，脑子必须转三转。”此外，还应诱导大家多读课外读物。
    有人说：“我写我”是一条线，“向外转”是一滩滩，材料组织不起来。因此，在写作方法上就得联系实际提出“排队”的办法，来帮助学员克服组织材料的困难。“排队”有几个步骤：第一“找排头”；第二“报数”；第三“清查人数”。例如：有一个同志在写“伟大的祖国”一文时，他找了两个排头。第一个是工业建设，他把铁路、工厂、赵国有都放在工业建设这一排里站了队。站了队就报
    一下数，看自己要找的都来了没有。第二个排头是农业建设。棉花、李顺达、梁军站在这一队；但在清查人数中，发现郝建秀也站在这里了，就立刻请她站到工业建设那一队去。这样排了队，段落清了，层次也清了，就可以动笔写。为了使大家弄清分段的问题，可以用下面的快板说明：“船有码头，车有站，写文章要分段；分段不是找麻烦，也不是为好看，为了写的清楚，读着方便。”
    在“我写我”的过程中，一般是用一件具体事实来说明一个问题，这是比较容易的。“向外转”之后，往往要从多方面来说明一个问题，为了使学员仍然能够写得具体，防止空洞，就要让大家学会用事实说明问题。这样才能写得快、写得多、写得具体、写得明确。在“我写我”的过程中，学员一般都写记叙文。在向外转时，由于范围扩大，内容增多，文体有了变化，他们能写说明文了。过去是通过一件事说明一个问题，现在则能从几个方面说明一个问题。
    如何巩固教学成果
    经过“我写我”、“向外转”等教学活动以后，多数同志能写千字左右的文章。他们一般已能掌握重点并具体地说明问题，而且能分段，语句也较通顺了。少数程度较差的同志，虽然初步学会分段，也能抓住重点，但往往写得不够具体。在阅读方面，读千字左右的通俗文章需七——八分钟；能说出中心大意，但读得不够流畅。此时学员的主要问题是：写作范围还不能扩展到各个方面；语句囉嗦，词汇语句的基本知识还不丰富；他们迫切要求多讲多读，充实自己的知识。因为他们感到“自己的文章没书上的劲大，没书上的简单明了”，因而在课外活动或课堂休息中，阅读书报的人数必然大量增加。所以这一阶段教学的重点，在于巩固第一阶段的教学成果，通过讲解和阅读范文、大量阅读通俗书报等活动，使学员获得更多的词汇和语句的基本知识，养成写作和阅读的习惯，从而进一步扩大自己的眼界，提高思考、阅读和写作的能力。在教学的具体实施上，可采用下述几种基本方法：
    首先，教育学员养成写作的习惯，扩展写作范围。怎样养成写作的习惯呢？
    （一）让每个同志明白“到处留心有文章”这句话的意思。在大家懂得这一点以后，就觉得可写的东西实在太多了。例如有的同志看见火车上的许多新气象，就想写文章。
    （二）结合大量阅读读物，提倡读后作文。这种把写作和阅读结合起来的方法，不仅可以使学员更好地消化读物，而且可以帮助他们练习写作。
    （三）提倡“旧翻新”，修改自己过去写的文章。学员在修改过去所写的文章中，就会看到自己过去写作的缺点，而觉察出今天的写作水平已经提高。
    （四）进行短时作文，让学员锻炼思考能力和迅速写作的能力。
    （五）提倡大量写日记和墙报稿。
    （六）结合实际需要练习写应用文。如：练习写信、作课堂笔记、作会议记录，练习写比较简单的报告、总结、通讯等等。使大家真正感到写作对当前的工作和学习有很大用处。
    其次，整理语句。由于学员词汇、语句的基础知识还很不丰富，并且平常说话时也有许多语病，因此，在写作中，便产生语句重复囉嗦、不完整、不通顺、用词不当等毛病。所以，培养学员整理语句的能力是很必要的。但这不是说要给学员讲一套语法修词，而是把学员平常说话和写作中易犯的语病提出来加以纠正。在整理语句时要用下列方法：
    （一）要分类整理，这样问题集中，印象深刻。
    （二）要专门来整理，不是随便捎带讲几句。（三）要联系生活，不要光在作业上兜圈子。（四）要做整理语句的作业。在课堂讲解之后，出题要大家修改，或检查自己的作业。这样使大家养成整理语句的习惯。（五）在整理语句中，要加强对课文中某些语句的学习，使大家在阅读中丰富语句的知识，学习科学、优美的语句。
    第三，加强讲解和阅读读物的活动，养成阅读习惯。在这一阶段，课文讲解和阅读的比重，应适当地增加。对重点课，要求精读；并指定辅助课叫大家阅读研究，使学员进一步体会写作的方法，并提高阅读能力。另外，要指导大家大量阅读读物。首先要根据教学的重点，指定阅读材料（应该指导学习小组来组织对于这些材料的阅读和讨论）。教员事先应讲明阅读的目的和要求。小组把阅读讨论的结果和问题汇报以后，再由教员集中起来，进行解答和讲评。再就是必须提倡经常读报和阅读通俗读物。教员和俱乐部负责图书工作的同志，要根据大家的水平经常介绍报纸上和通俗书刊上可读的材料，让大家在课外自由阅读。还可以采取课外活动的方式，组织大家读报、读通俗作品、读短小的通讯等等。
