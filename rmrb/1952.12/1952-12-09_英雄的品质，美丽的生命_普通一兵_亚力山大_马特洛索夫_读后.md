    Heroic Qualities, Beautiful Life
    ——After Reading "An Ordinary Soldier: Alexander Matrosov"
    Author: Soviet Zhulba. Translator: Jin Ren. Published by Times Publishing House.

    Soviet writer Zhulba's "An Ordinary Soldier: Alexander Matrosov" is a novel that inspires progress. The author describes the life and struggle of the famous Soviet hero Matrosov, portraying his excellent revolutionary qualities and noble spiritual character.

    Matrosov is a typical outstanding youth of the Stalin era. The path he took, like countless socialist new people, was both ordinary and great. Matrosov was not a superhuman or a deity, but an ordinary Soviet youth. Matrosov's greatness was gradually cultivated through ordinary life, study, and work. He was originally an orphan with no parents, wandering everywhere, but under the infinite care and education of the Soviet motherland, he finally grew into an outstanding people's hero. In the early days of the Patriotic War, he was a student at a reformatory school, working in the iron shop of the reformatory school's factory, doing a very simple job - filing various saws. He didn't feel the slightest boredom with this "small thing," thinking: the reformatory school is making ammunition boxes, the faster he can file the saws well, the faster the work in each workshop will proceed, the more ammunition boxes will be supplied to the front, and the more German bandits the Red Army soldiers will be able to kill. He carefully studied and improved his working methods, raising the production quota to 300%, and his name was also on the honor roll of Stakhanovite workers in the reformatory school. He put into practice Lenin's instruction with action: never refuse small things at any time in work, because big things are made up of small things.

    Never bowing to any difficulty is one of Matrosov's characteristics. No matter how heavy and difficult the task is, Matrosov can complete it victoriously with great courage and wisdom. When salvaging wood from the ice for the reformatory school to rush to make ammunition boxes, he prominently demonstrated an optimistic spirit of daring to overcome difficulties. Stalin's call of "Everything for the front" inspired him. When salvaging wood, he not only created a method of rolling logs, increasing the efficiency of transporting wood tenfold, but also personally jumped into the icy water, leading many older children to work together, finally overcoming all kinds of difficulties and completing the task. He said, "A real person - even if blood is flowing from his nose, even if his hands are broken, cannot put down the necessary work." What a resolute heroic statement. On the march, the soldier Makayev always complained when he encountered difficulties or small disappointments, but Matrosov could always control his emotions. Makayev believed that "everyone has times when they are in a bad mood," and that complaining was unavoidable, but Matrosov did not agree with his opinion: "Are you talking about emotions? If you let your emotions dominate you - it will lead you into a mud pit. I control my own emotions, however I want." No matter how tiring the march, Matrosov always liked to sing happily, he said: "Singing is strength. Singing makes life and soul beautiful." He believed that "crying is easier than anything." When he encountered difficulties in learning and work, he often said with confidence: "Difficult, but very interesting!"

    Matrosov always stood at the forefront, always doing things the best. In the reformatory school, in the infantry school, in marching and combat on the front, he excellently completed the tasks assigned by the organization. When requesting to join the army from the counselor at the reformatory school, when expressing his desire to join the Communist Youth League at the Youth League meeting discussing his admission, when applying to the principal of the infantry school to participate in combat, when requesting to serve as a scout from the company commander on the front, he all said this solemn sentence with a revolutionary heroic spirit: "Please believe honestly, I will not be a disgrace." This sentence is short and powerful, it contains a very profound practical significance. He also liked to say: "We are going to live like this, so that humanity will live better because of our existence." And he realized this sentence with actual life and struggle.

    A young man who had read this book said: "Among Matrosov's various excellent qualities, what touches me the most is his love for life." This is right. Matrosov not only loved his own life and the lives of the people, but also loved all new, growing natural things. After his sacrifice, Captain Bugrachov even pulled out two blooming branches from the pocket of his close-fitting vest, which he had broken off from the trees during the march, and he always wanted to ask the company's Party branch secretary Kedrov why they bloomed so early. Matrosov's love for life is inseparable from his love for the motherland. He deeply realized: it is happiness to live on the Soviet land, he should live well and fight to create greater happiness. In order to defend the beautiful life on the Soviet land, he bravely dedicated his life. In a battle, at a decisive moment in the fight against the German fascist bandits, he rushed to the enemy's firing point, using his chest to block the flame-spewing machine gun muzzle, jamming the machine gun, so that the Red Army soldiers were able to defeat the firing point and win the victory, and continue to advance. The motherland made him "stronger than bullets and fire, stronger than the terror of death."

    The birth and growth of the Matrosov-style new people is inseparable from the superior social system. Matrosov said when studying at the infantry school: "In any capitalist country, they would trample me like grass on the side of the road." The fact is indeed so: in the United States, aren't there countless wandering children like Matrosov who are neglected and destroyed? Only in countries where the people truly hold power, because the people's party and government give the people the conditions to fully develop their talent and wisdom, can everyone, as long as they work hard, possibly grow into new heroic figures.

    "An Ordinary Soldier - Alexander Matrosov" has some significant characteristics in its creative methods. The most significant of these is: using actual life and struggle to portray the characters' personalities, both writing about the heroic actions of the heroic figures and excavating the thoughts and feelings of the heroic figures. There is no empty conceptual description, no list of weak slogans, life and struggle itself shows everything about the characters. Every new character in the work - Matrosov, Grandpa Magar, Counselor Koravchuk, female teacher Ulasyevna, Captain Bugrachov, etc., are all created very successfully by the author, every new character in the work is alive and has personality. The authenticity of the artistic image tightly grabs the reader's heart.

    This novel has been welcomed by the vast number of Chinese readers, increasingly expanding its educational impact. Readers all love Matrosov, and are willing to strive to be Matrosov-style new people. Some readers have even pasted Matrosov's words on the wall like mottos, and written them in their diaries; some readers have even written reading notes, expressing their determination to learn from the hero: "Live and work like Matrosov." Yes, the hero is not dead, he is by our side, he is always encouraging us to rush towards the communist tomorrow!

    英雄的品质，美丽的生命
    ——“普通一兵——亚力山大·马特洛索夫”读后杜黎均
    作者　苏联　茹尔巴　译者　金人　时代出版社出版
    苏联作家茹尔巴的“普通一兵——亚力山大·马特洛索夫”是一本鼓舞人前进的小说。作者描写了著名的苏联英雄马特洛索夫的生活和斗争，刻划了他优秀的革命品质和崇高的精神面貌。
    马特洛索夫是斯大林时代的优秀青年的典型。他所走的道路，正像无数社会主义新人所走过的一样，是平凡的，又是伟大的。马特洛索夫并不是什么超人和神人，而是一个普通的苏维埃青年。马特洛索夫的伟大，正是由平凡的生活、学习和工作中逐渐培养而成的。他本来是一个无父无母、到处流浪的孤儿，但在苏维埃祖国对他的无限关怀和教育下，终于成长为一个杰出的人民英雄。在卫国战争初期，他是教养院的一个学生，在教养院工厂的铁工部担任了一件很简单的工作——锉磨各种锯子。他对这件“小事情”丝毫不觉得厌倦，他想着：教养院在制造弹药箱，他越能加速将锯子锉磨好，各车间的工作就会进行得越快，供给前线的弹药箱就会越多，红军战士就能更多地杀死德寇。他仔细钻研，改善了工作方法，将产品定额提高到百分之三百，他的名字也登上了教养院斯塔哈诺夫工作者的光荣榜。他用行动来实践了列宁的遗训：在工作中无论何时都不要拒绝小事情，因为大事是由小事积成的。
    在任何困难面前不低头，是马特洛索夫的特点之一。不管任务多么繁重艰苦，马特洛索夫都能够以极大的勇敢和智慧胜利完成。在教养院为了赶制弹药箱而打捞冰中的木材时，他突出地表现了勇于克服困难的乐观主义精神。斯大林的“一切为了前线”的号召鼓舞着他。在打捞木材时，他不仅创造了滚木的方法，将运木材的效率提高了十倍，而且还亲自跳在冰水里，带动了许多大孩子们来一齐干，终于克服了种种困难而完成了任务。他说：“一个真正的人，——即使鼻子里流出血来，即使双手破裂，也不能放下必需的工作。”这是何等坚决的英雄豪语。在行军中，战士马凯耶夫总是因遇到困难或小不如意而抱怨，但马特洛索夫却永远能控制自己的情绪。马凯耶夫认为“任何人都有情绪不好的时候”，说抱怨话是难免的，马特洛索夫却不同意他的意见：“你是说的情绪吗？如果你任凭情绪支配的话，——它会把你引进泥坑里去。我自己支配自己的情绪，愿怎样就怎样。”不管行军多么劳累，马特洛索夫总喜欢愉快地唱着歌，他说：“唱歌就是力量。唱歌使生活和灵魂变得美丽。”他认为“哭是比什么都容易的”。他在学习和工作中遇到困难时，常常这样满怀信心地说：“困难，但是很有趣！”
    马特洛索夫永远站在最前面，永远把事情干得最好。在教养院，在步兵学校，在前线行军和作战中，他都出色地完成了组织上所分配的工作。在教养院向辅导员要求参军时，在讨论他入团的青年团会议上表示入团愿望时，在步兵学校向校长申请参加作战时，在前线向连长要求担任侦察工作时，他都曾怀着革命的英雄主义的心情，说出了这句庄严的话：“请老实相信，不会丢人。”这句话是简短而有力的，它包含着非常深刻的实践意义。他还喜欢说：“咱们将要这样生存下去，要使人类由于咱们的生存而过得更好。”并用实际的生活和斗争实现了这句话。
    一位读过本书的青年人说：“在马特洛索夫的各种优秀品质中，最使我感动的，是他的热爱生命。”这说得对。马特洛索夫不仅热爱自己的生命和人民的生命，而且也热爱着一切新生的、成长中的自然物。在他牺牲以后，上尉布格拉乔夫还从他贴身背心的口袋里掏出来两段正在开花的树枝，这是他在行军中把它们从树上折下来的，他一直想问问连队的党支部书记凯德洛夫，为什么它们这样早的时候就开花。马特洛索夫的热爱生命是和热爱祖国分不开的。他深深体会到：生活在苏维埃国土上是幸福的，他应该好好地活下去，为创造更大的幸福而斗争。为了保卫苏维埃国土上的美丽的生命，他就英勇地将自己的生命贡献出来。一次争夺战中，在与德国法西斯强盗作战的决定性的时刻，他冲到敌人的火力点上，用自己的胸膛挡住了喷着火焰的机关枪口，把机关枪卡住了，红军战士们才得打垮火力点而取得胜利，继续前进。祖国使他“比弹火更有力量，比死亡的恐怖更有力量”。
    马特洛索夫式新人的诞生和成长，是与优越的社会制度分不开的。马特洛索夫在步兵学校学习时，说：“在任何一个资本主义国家里，会把我像路旁的草一样践踏掉。”事实也正是这样：在美国，不是有无数像马特洛索夫一样的流浪儿童无人过问而堕落毁灭了吗？只有在人民真正掌握政权的国家里，由于人民的政党和政府给予人民充分发挥天才与智慧的条件，所以人人只要努力，都有可能成长为新的英雄人物。
    “普通一兵—亚力山大·马特洛索夫”在创作方法上有着一些显著的特点。其中最显著的特点是：用实际的生活和斗争刻划了人物的性格，既写出了英雄人物的英雄行动，也发掘了英雄人物的思想感情。这里没有空洞的概念的描述，没有无力的标语口号的罗列，生活和斗争本身就表现了人物的一切。作品中的每一个新的人物——马特洛索夫、马加尔爷爷、辅导员柯拉甫楚克、女教员乌拉茜耶夫娜、上尉布格拉乔夫等，都被作者创造得很成功，作品中的每一个新的人物都是有生命的，有个性的。艺术形象的真实性紧紧地抓住了读者的心。
    这本小说已为广大中国读者所欢迎，日益扩大着它的教育影响。读者们都热爱着马特洛索夫，都愿为争取作马特洛索夫式的新人而努力。有的读者还把马特洛索夫所说过的话当作格言一样的贴在墙上，写在自己的日记本上；有的读者还曾写了读后感，表示自己向英雄学习的决心：“按照马特洛索夫的样子去生活和工作。”是的，英雄没有死，他就在我们身边，他随时都在鼓舞着我们向共产主义的明天突进！
