Xinhua News Agency, December 29th – The China Peace Committee sent a New Year greeting telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The full text is as follows: To Commander Peng and all commanders, fighters, staff, political, logistics, cultural, educational, and medical personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, dear comrades!
　　On the occasion of New Year's Day in 1953, we extend our warmest congratulations and highest respect to you on behalf of the people of the whole country, and express our deep sympathy to the comrades who are gloriously wounded or ill due to overwork.
　　We warmly congratulate you on the great victory you have won alongside the Korean People's Army. In the past year, you have eliminated more than 240,000 enemy troops and shot down or damaged more than 5,300 enemy aircraft. Including the previous totals, you have eliminated more than 730,000 enemy troops, of which more than 300,000 were American aggressor troops, and shot down or damaged more than 7,800 enemy aircraft. The recent victory of our army in the Battle of Shangganling further proves that the Chinese and Korean people's forces are becoming stronger and stronger. They not only maintain a strong force of living strength, but also have greatly improved in equipment and material supply, and have accumulated rich experience in modern warfare, learning the offensive and defensive battles of the positions. Therefore, no matter how many casualties the enemy pays, they cannot move forward, thus completely stabilizing the front line around the 38th parallel, laying a solid foundation for the final defeat of the enemy. Your great victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has not only defended the independence and freedom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also defended the security of our own country and the happy life of the people, and enabled the country to smoothly complete various social and political reforms and economic recovery work.
　　Now, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our country has basically completed political reform and economic recovery, and has entered a period of large-scale planned economic construction. This year is the first year of our country's first five-year plan. The people of the whole country are thinking of you and deeply thanking you on this great day.
　　Now the American aggressors continue to persist in and vainly attempt to expand the Korean War. The United States has indefinitely suspended the Korean armistice negotiations, and then manipulated the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution supporting the United States' forced retention of prisoners of war, while constantly and inhumanly massacring our captured personnel, and clamoring to launch a so-called new "offensive." The people of the whole country, like you, are maintaining a high degree of vigilance against the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war, and have made up their minds to strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea while carrying out large-scale construction, striving for great victories in both national construction and the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea.
　　Dear comrades! The people of the motherland earnestly hope that you will continue to strike at the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and strive for greater victories in order to defend the construction of the motherland, to assist the Korean people in resisting aggression, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. We guarantee that the people of the whole country will practice their oath: "We will give money if you need money, we will give grain if you need grain, we will give people if you need people," and we will use greater strength to support your operations, continue to strengthen your equipment and power; and we will ensure that we do a good job in giving preferential treatment and compensation to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, so that you can wholeheartedly fight against the enemy.
　　I wish you a happy new year, good health, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace in the motherland and the world!
　　China Peace Committee
　　Xinhua News Agency, December 29th – The China Peace Committee sent a New Year greeting telegram to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People and the Korean People's Army. The full text is as follows: Respected General Kim Il-sung and all commanders and fighters of the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, comrades!
　　On the occasion of New Year's Day in 1953, we extend our warmest congratulations and highest respect to you on behalf of the entire Chinese people.
　　For two and a half years, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army have waged an extremely arduous and heroic struggle against the US imperialist aggressors in order to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland, giving the US aggressor troops countless painful blows, shattering the aggressors' dream of destroying Korea, stopping the spread of the flames of war in the Far East, and defending peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army have won the honor of the world, and the peace-loving people of the world are sympathizing with and supporting you.
　　China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth. The fighting friendship between our two peoples is unbreakable and has become an invincible force. The Chinese people deeply know that continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea is one of the central tasks of our people. To this end, this association has recently issued instructions, calling on all our people to support you with the greatest strength until the Korean issue is finally resolved fairly and reasonably.
　　Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!
　　Long live the fraternal friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea!
　　Long live General Kim Il-sung!
　　China Peace Committee

    中国人民抗美援朝总会电志愿军和朝鲜军民贺年
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会给志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员的新年贺电。全文如下：中国人民志愿军彭司令员并转全体指挥员、战斗员、参谋工作人员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、文化教育工作人员、医疗卫生工作人员，亲爱的同志们！
    值此一九五三年元旦，我们谨代表全国人民向你们致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意，并向你们中间光荣负伤，或因劳成疾的同志们表示深切的慰问。
    我们热烈地祝贺你们和朝鲜人民军在一起并肩作战所赢得的伟大胜利。过去一年，你们又歼灭了敌人二十四万多人，打落打伤敌机五千三百架以上，连以前合计，共歼敌七十三万人以上，其中美国侵略军占三十多万人，打落打伤敌机七千八百架以上。最近我军在上甘岭战役中的胜利，更加证明中朝人民部队愈战愈强，不仅保持着雄厚的有生力量，也不仅在装备上和物资供应上有了极大的改善，而且积累了现代化作战的丰富经验，学会了阵地的攻坚战和守备战，因而使敌人无论付出多大伤亡都不能前进一步，这样就使战线在三八线一带完全稳定了下来，奠定了最后打败敌人的巩固基础。你们在抗美援朝作战中的伟大胜利不仅保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立和自由，而且保卫了我们自己祖国的安全，保卫了祖国人民的幸福生活，并使祖国能够顺利地完成各项社会、政治改革工作和经济恢复工作。
    现在，我们国家在我们的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导之下，已经基本上结束政治改革工作和经济恢复工作，开始进入大规模的有计划的经济建设时期，今年就是我们国家第一个五年建设计划的第一年。全国的人民在这个伟大的日子里，都想念着你们，深深地感谢你们。
    现在美国侵略者继续坚持并妄想扩大朝鲜战争。美国方面已经无限期地中断朝鲜停战谈判，接着又操纵联合国第七届大会通过了支持美国的强迫扣留战俘的非法决议案，同时不断地惨无人道地屠杀我方被俘人员，并且叫嚣着要发动所谓新的“攻势”。对于美帝国主义这一扩大战争的阴谋，全国人民正和你们一样，保持着高度的警觉，而且已经下定决心，要在进行大规模建设的同时，加强抗美援朝工作来支援你们，争取国家建设事业和抗美援朝斗争这两个方面都获得伟大胜利。
    亲爱的同志们！祖国人民热望你们再接再厉地打击敌人，消灭敌人，为着保卫祖国的建设，为着援助朝鲜人民反抗侵略，为着保卫远东和全世界的和平而争取更大的胜利。我们保证，我们全国人民将实践自己的誓言：“要钱有钱，要粮有粮，要人有人”，用更大的力量来支持你们的作战，继续加强你们的装备和威力；并保证做好优待和抚恤烈属军属的工作，使你们能够全心全意地对敌作战。
    祝你们新年快乐，身体健康，为祖国和全世界和平事业建立更大的功劳！
    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会给金日成将军暨朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的新年贺电。全文如下：敬爱的金日成将军并转英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    值兹一九五三年元旦，我们谨代表全中国人民向你们致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
    两年半以来，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在金日成将军的领导之下，为保卫祖国的独立与自由，对美帝国主义侵略者作了极其艰苦的英勇的斗争，给予美国侵略军以无数次的痛击，粉碎了侵略者灭亡朝鲜的迷梦，制止了远东战火的蔓延，保卫了远东和全世界的和平。因此，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军也就获得了全世界的荣誉，全世界爱好和平的人民都在同情和支持着你们。
    中朝两国唇齿相依是天然的，我们两国人民的战斗友谊是牢不可破的，它已成为了不可战胜的力量。中国人民深知继续加强抗美援朝斗争乃是我们全国人民当前中心任务之一。为此，本会在最近已发出指示，号召我全国人民用最大的力量来支援你们。直到朝鲜问题获得最后的公平合理的解决为止。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    中朝两国人民兄弟般的友谊和团结万岁！
    金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民抗美援朝总会
