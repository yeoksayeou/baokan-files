    Accept the Lessons of the Failure of the Zhang Biyou Mutual Aid Team
    The report "Why Zhang Biyou Mutual Aid Team Can't Balance Its Accounts," published in our newspaper today, once again proves the principle that farmers must be organized step by step based on their own practical experience and the conditions of the cadres, and that blindly pursuing advanced forms will inevitably lead to failure. It is true that most of the members of the Zhang Biyou Mutual Aid Team were emancipated peasants, and they demanded to be organized to develop production after the land reform. However, they lacked mutual aid experience, and their collectivist ideology was weak. Therefore, the form of mutual aid they could accept could only be low-level, not high-level. In this case, they should be patiently educated to explain the benefits of organizing, introduce the experiences of advanced mutual aid teams, and propose forms that they could accept, and then organize them. However, the comrades of the work team stationed in Shamao Township did not do this. They believed that only permanent, fixed mutual aid teams were mutual aid teams, and they were only willing to lead high-level mutual aid teams and were unwilling to lead low-level mutual aid teams. They did not understand the principle that high-level forms develop from low-level forms. Therefore, they only asked Xu Dingxue to give one report, and completely failed to explain to the peasants Xu Dingxue's team's practices, what could be done now, and what could not be done now, and simply allowed the peasants to organize themselves completely according to Xu Dingxue's team's method. Its result would inevitably be failure, and of course, there was no doubt about it. Any comrade with this kind of erroneous way of thinking should wake up immediately and thoroughly correct all subjective and reckless practices.

    接受张必友互助组失败的教训
    本报今天发表的“张必友互助组为什么算不清账”的报道，再一次证明了必须根据农民的切身经验和干部条件，有步骤地引导农民组织起来，而盲目追求高级形式必然失败的道理。诚然，张必友互助组的大部分组员都是翻身农民，他们在土地改革后，是要求组织起来发展生产的。但是，他们是没有互助经验的，他们的集体主义思想是薄弱的，因此，他们所能接受的互助形式，只能是低级的，不能是高级的。在这种情况下，应该耐心地向他们进行宣传教育，说明组织起来的好处，介绍先进的互助组的经验，提出他们可能接受的形式，把他们组织起来。但住在纱帽乡的工作组的同志却不是这样作的。他们认为只有常年定型的互助组才是互助组，他们只愿意领导高级形式的互助组，不愿意领导低级形式的互助组，他们不懂得高级形式是由低级形式发展起来的道理。因此，他们只请徐定学作了一次报告，完全没有向农民说明徐定学组的作法，那些现在可作，那些现在还不能作，就让农民完全按照徐定学组的办法组织起来。其结果必然失败，当然是毫无疑问的了。任何有这种错误的思想方法的同志都应该猛省过来，彻底纠正一切主观蛮干的作法。
