    Actively Promote Advanced Experiences and Conduct Timely Work Inspections:
    Basic Construction Projects in North China Accelerate Progress and Improve Quality
    This year, the basic construction work in North China has accelerated its progress and ensured the quality of projects due to the increasing attention of leaders at all levels and the promotion of various advanced experiences. Up to now, the construction projects have completed more than 70% of the annual projects. It is expected that 86.87% will be completed by the end of this year, and the installation work will be 75% completed by the end of the year. In late September, the North China Administrative Committee's Construction Engineering Bureau sent 36 cadres to 28 construction sites in Tianjin, Shanxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, and the former Chahar regions for inspection. The quality of the projects this year is generally better, and the phenomenon of "nine out of ten houses being bad" last year has been basically changed. 98% of the projects avoided major rework caused by poor construction.
    Leaders at all levels in North China have paid attention to basic construction this year. Various provinces and cities have convened special meetings on basic construction several times, criticizing various bureaucratic, capitalist, and supply system ideologies in management, and strengthening basic construction work. After inspecting the slow progress of the project in July, the Xuanhua Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held several meetings to unify the ideological understanding of leading cadres, establish a basic construction committee, conduct project scheduling, strengthen site management, and concentrate efforts on organizing construction.
    Beginning in July, the "double-handed squeezing slurry bricklaying method" of Su Changyou and Fu Hongbin, and the woodworking assembly line operation method were widely promoted in the construction industry. So far, the skilled workers of advanced groups who have adopted the main advanced experiences in the entire region have reached 49.5% of all skilled workers. The efficiency of bricklaying, woodworking, plastering, and caulking has generally increased by one to two times compared to before the promotion. The North China Basic Construction Engineering Company completed 44% of the total increase in production and savings tasks within two months after promoting advanced technologies. After organizing 92% of technicians to use advanced work methods, the three major construction sites in Tianjin increased production and saved 7 billion yuan in two months. At the same time, with the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company as the leader, the method of rhythmic production according to the indicated charts was tested, site management was improved, and the phenomenon of shutdowns and wasted work was reduced. The working hours of the entire project of the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company were thus shortened by more than 50%, greatly saving national resources.
    However, because of the weak design and construction forces in various places, and the lack of thorough and correct design and construction work, the phenomenon of partial rework waste and disregard for quality still exists. (Cao Yinghuai)

### 积极推广先进经验及时进行工作检查  华北区基本建设工程进度加速质量提高

    积极推广先进经验及时进行工作检查
    华北区基本建设工程进度加速质量提高
    华北各地今年的基本建设工作，因为各级领导的逐渐重视，和推广了各种先进经验，加速了工程进度，并保证了工程质量。到目前为止，建筑工程已完成全年工程的百分之七十以上，预计至今年年底可完成百分之八十六点八七，安装工作至年底可完成百分之七十五。九月下旬，华北行政委员会建筑工程局曾派出干部三十六人，分赴天津、山西、河北、绥远、原察哈尔五地区、二十八个工地进行检查，今年工程质量一般较好，基本上改变了去年十房九坏的现象，百分之九十八的工程避免了因施工不良引起大返工的现象。
    华北区各级领导，今年对基本建设已引起注意。各省市曾数次召集关于基本建设的专门会议，批判了各种官僚主义和经营方面的资本主义思想与供给制思想，加强基本建设工作。中共宣化市委员会于七月间检查了工程进度迟缓的情况后，曾几次开会统一领导干部思想认识，建立基本建设委员会，进行工程排队，加强工地管理，集中力量组织施工。
    七月开始，在建筑业中普遍推广苏长有、傅鸿宾的双手挤浆砌砖法和木工流水作业法等。至今，全区采用主要先进经验的先进小组的技术工人，已达全部技术工人的百分之四十九点五。砌砖、木工、抹灰，抅缝的效率，一般比未推广前提高一倍至二倍。华北基本建设工程公司，自推广先进技术后，两个月即完成全部增产节约任务的百分之四十四。天津三大工地，自组织了百分之九十二的技工使用先进工作法后，两个月便增产节约七十亿元。同时，以华北基本建设工程公司为首，重点试行了按指示图表进行有节奏生产的方法，改善工地管理，减少了停工、窝工现象。华北基本建设工程公司整个工程工时因而缩短百分之五十以上，大量节约了国家资财。
    但是，因为各地设计、施工力量薄弱，和缺乏周密正确的设计施工工作，局部的返工浪费与不重视质量的现象依然存在。  （曹英怀）
