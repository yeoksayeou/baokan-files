Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has experienced great development during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." According to preliminary statistics, in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou and other places alone, more than 1.5 million people joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association within a month. Now the membership in these seven major cities is nearly 5 million, the vast majority of whom are working people. Employees of many factories, such as the Shanghai Yongda Private Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Hangzhou Liqun Cigarette Factory, have collectively joined the association. The broad masses of farmers who were educated during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" consider joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association a great honor. Luojiangkou Township in Daxian County, Sichuan Province, originally had more than 5,300 members, accounting for half of the population. During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," more than 2,000 people applied for membership. In Qu County, Zhejiang Province, many farmers traveled dozens of miles to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the city to pick up membership application forms. People of all ethnic minorities and religious figures have also enthusiastically joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In Kangding, Xikang Province, more than 150 agricultural and pastoral labor models, Living Buddhas, Lamas and other participants in the Third People's Representative Conference of the Tibetan Autonomous Region collectively joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" office in Lushan County, Guizhou Province, groups of three or five people came every day to apply for membership. A 103-year-old Miao woman, Tian, asked her two daughters-in-law to help her brave the rain into the city to fill out a membership application on November 7th. She said, "I have lived for so long, and only now have I begun to live a happy life. I want to be friends with the Soviet people. If the Chinese and Soviet people are united, no one will dare to invade again, and our Miao people can live in peace forever."

During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the grassroots organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have begun to spread throughout the cities and villages of the country, and the original organizations have been further consolidated. In Harbin, Northeast China, more than 80 branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association were added during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Nearly a thousand new Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations were established in urban and rural areas of Ningxia Province. In some areas, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association convened member representative meetings during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" to summarize work and adjust organizational structures. Many previously unsound grassroots organizations have also been rectified and improved. All counties in Zhejiang Province generally convened member representative meetings of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Sixty-three units in Taiyuan City held member representative meetings to democratically evaluate the cadres of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's grassroots organizations.

During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," many new and old members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various regions became active promoters and key members of Sino-Soviet friendship. Yin Jihua, a newly joined farmer in the first district of Jin County, Lushun-Dalian, promoted Sino-Soviet friendship to everyone he met, raising the awareness of more than 150 people about the Soviet Union. Ma Gui, a Hui female member in Guihua City, also promoted the cause everywhere every day, developing more than 100 new members. Members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Zhejiang Province sent more than 10,000 letters to Soviet friends. Members in various regions are very enthusiastic about learning. More than 25,000 members in Jinghai County, Hebei Province, have studied the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" textbook. The circulation of "Henan Sino-Soviet Friendship News" has soared from 40,000 copies to more than 100,000 copies.

In order to make Sino-Soviet friendship activities regular and a force to promote various tasks, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions have begun to lead members in formulating work plans and various systems. The steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the Jiamike Button Factory in Suzhou have established a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day" system, using Sundays to collectively watch Soviet films or hold seminars and report meetings. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Shanghai Yongda Private Dyeing and Weaving Factory decided at a member representative meeting to make reports to all factory employees on learning from the Soviet Union every month based on the ideological situation of the employees and combined with the factory's central tasks; and to regularly organize employees to promote advanced Soviet experience. The Nandang Mutual Aid Group in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, has included the promotion of Sino-Soviet friendship activities in its winter production plan.

    在“中苏友好月”中中苏友好协会有很大发展
    【新华社九日讯】中苏友好协会在“中苏友好月”中有很大的发展。据初步统计，仅北京、天津、沈阳、上海、西安、重庆、广州等地在一个月内就有一百五十多万人参加中苏友好协会，现在这七大城市的会员已近五百万人，其中劳动人民占绝大多数。上海私营永大染织厂、杭州市利群烟厂等许多工厂的职工都集体入会。在“中苏友好月”中受到教育的广大农民，都以加入中苏友协为极大的光荣。四川省达县罗江口乡原有五千三百多会员，占人口的一半，在“中苏友好月”中又有二千多人申请入会。浙江省衢县有许多农民从几十里地以外赶到城内中苏友协去领取入会申请书。各地少数民族人民及宗教界人士也都热情地加入了中苏友好协会。西康省康定有一百五十多个参加藏族自治区第三届各族各界人民代表会议的农业、牧业劳动模范和活佛、喇嘛等集体参加中苏友协。在贵州省炉山县的“中苏友好月”办公室里，每天有三五成群的人来申请入会，一位一百零三岁的苗族田老太太在十一月七日那天，让两个儿媳扶着自己冒雨进城填写入会申请书，她说：“我活了这么大年纪，才开始过幸福生活。我要和苏联人民做朋友，中苏人民团结得好，就不会有人敢再来侵犯，我们苗家可以永远过太平日子了。”
    在“中苏友好月”中，中苏友好协会的基层组织已开始普及到全国的城市和乡村，原有的组织也进一步地得到巩固。东北哈尔滨市在“中苏友好月”中增设了八十多个中苏友好协会支会；宁夏省城乡新建立的中苏友好协会组织近一千个。有些地区的中苏友好协会，在“中苏友好月”中召开了会员代表会议，总结了工作和调整了组织机构；很多原先不够健全的基层组织也得到整顿和提高。浙江省各县普遍召开了中苏友好协会会员代表会议；太原市有六十三个单位分别举行会员代表会议，民主评选中苏友好协会基层组织的干部。
    各地中苏友好协会的新老会员在“中苏友好月”中，很多成为宣传中苏友好的积极分子和骨干。旅大区金县第一区新入会的农民尹吉华，逢人便宣传中苏友好，使一百五十多人提高了对苏联的认识。归绥市回族女会员马贵也每天到处宣传，发展了一百多新会员。浙江省的中苏友好协会会员曾寄出一万多封信件给苏联友人。各地会员们学习的热情很高，河北省静海县二万五千多会员都学习了“中苏友好”的课本。“河南中苏友好报”的发行数由四万份激增为十多万份。
    为了使中苏友好活动经常化，成为推动各项工作的力量，各地中苏友好协会已开始领导会员订立工作计划和各种制度。太原钢铁厂炼钢部和苏州市嘉美克纽扣厂都创立了“中苏友好活动日”的制度，利用星期日集体观看苏联影片或举行座谈会、报告会。上海私营永大染织厂的中苏友好协会，在会员代表会议上决定每个月根据职工思想情况并结合工厂的中心任务，向全厂职工作有关学习苏联的报告；并经常组织职工推广苏联先进经验。江苏省盐城县南荡互助组把宣传中苏友好的活动，列入了冬季生产计划中。
