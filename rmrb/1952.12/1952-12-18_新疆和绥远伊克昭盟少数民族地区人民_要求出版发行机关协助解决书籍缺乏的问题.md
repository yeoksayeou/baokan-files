Editor's Note: The following letters from Xinjiang reader Miao Luping and Suiyuan Ikezhao League readers Sa Gelu and Niu Fengming both reflect the urgent desire of people in minority areas to solve the problem of book shortages. The insufficient number of books in minority languages is a difficulty left to us by the old society. The long-term reactionary rule created a severe situation of cultural backwardness among minority nationalities. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of minority nationalities urgently demand to improve their culture rapidly, and the problem of the lack of books in their native languages naturally arises. The People's Government attaches importance to this issue. However, due to limitations in human and material resources and other conditions, this problem can only be solved gradually and in a planned way.

In addition, the two letters also commonly point out that the current book and magazine distribution work in the above-mentioned two minority areas has not penetrated the masses, which is also one of the reasons for the book shortage. This situation deserves attention. In minority areas, most of which are vast and sparsely populated with inconvenient transportation and fewer cadres, this forms objective difficulties in distribution work. However, precisely because of this, book and magazine distributors need to have a hard-working style of going deep into the masses even more. Otherwise, even books and magazines that have been published cannot be effectively delivered to the readers. It is hoped that the book and magazine distribution organizations in the above-mentioned two places will pay attention to this issue, promote a work style of going deep into the masses, create practical work methods, and serve the people in minority areas better.

Comrades Editors: I am writing to you to reflect two demands of the people of Xinjiang regarding cultural life:

First, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang urgently need more reading materials in their native languages. The publishing departments in Xinjiang have made great efforts in this regard, but due to limitations in translation and compilation capabilities and other conditions, such reading materials cannot be published in large quantities. Currently, there are only a few books published in various ethnic languages, such as the Korean Correspondence Collection, collections of stories about Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Zhao Shuli's "The Floor." This is extremely disproportionate to the cultural life needs of all ethnic groups.

In the past, the reactionary ruling class implemented a policy of long-term oppression and division against the people of all ethnic groups, and the people of various minority nationalities were very unfamiliar with the history of the motherland. In the past two years, Xinjiang has published some textbooks on the history of the motherland, which have played a significant role in strengthening patriotic education. However, reference books on history are still very lacking. People of all ethnic groups also generally demand to study politics, and books such as the "Political Common Sense Reader" published by the "Study" magazine are very much needed to be printed in minority language versions. When teaching history, geography, and political common sense in schools in this province, most of them are taught by one person and translated by another, which takes a lot of time. This is related to the lack of reference materials. At present, there are many young students from ethnic minorities such as Uyghur and Kazakh in Xinjiang, with more than 20,000 middle school students alone. With the improvement of the living standards of people of all ethnic groups, the number of students will increase significantly in the future, and the demand for ethnic language reading materials will also increase accordingly. We earnestly hope that the publishing organizations will strive to meet the cultural needs of the people of all ethnic groups and publish more books in Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic languages.

Second, the current book and magazine supply work in Xinjiang is far from meeting the needs of the people and should be greatly strengthened. Xinjiang is a vast area with poor transportation conditions, which indeed poses certain difficulties for book and magazine supply work. However, the main reason why the book and magazine distribution work is out of touch with the demands of the masses is that the book and magazine distributors have not arduously gone deep into the masses, but only stopped the book and magazine distribution work in a few larger cities. Therefore, on the one hand, a large number of valuable books "cannot be sold" and are "imprisoned" in the bookstore, which not only accumulates state funds but also prevents new books and magazines from arriving for a long time. On the other hand, the vast majority of people cannot buy books even if they want to. For example, at the recent Xinjiang Provincial Farmers and Herdsmen Representatives Conference, the representatives pointed out that there was a shortage of winter school textbooks in various places, especially in pastoral areas, where some places had more than 60 people sharing one book. However, the Tacheng branch of Xinhua Bookstore had 2,000 winter school textbooks, but only sold 100 in the city and accumulated 1,900. The Dihua Xinhua Bookstore accumulated 40,000 copies and wanted to return them or sell them at a discount as slow-moving goods. After a staff member of Xinhua Bookstore heard the representatives' words, he said in surprise: "Our books can't be sold, how can the representatives say that there are not enough books!" Here, let me introduce such a fact: A staff member of the Hami branch of Xinhua Bookstore rode a horse and took some books to the farming and pastoral areas to promote sales. He originally thought that he would have to run to several villages to sell these books, but as soon as he arrived at the first village, all the books were snapped up. Unfortunately, this kind of work style of going deep into the masses has not been valued by the relevant leading organs and has not been praised and promoted in a timely manner.

At present, bookstores cannot be universally established in various regions of Xinjiang. In order to deliver a large number of books and magazines to remote farming and pastoral areas in a timely manner, a series of arduous tasks must be carried out. We should strive for all possible forces, such as utilizing cooperatives and other trade organizations that go deep into pastoral areas, to work together to supply the cultural food needed by the people of all ethnic groups.

Comrades Editors: The vast number of Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen in our Ikezhao League Autonomous Region urgently request publishing and distribution departments to help us solve the problem of the lack of reading materials, especially Mongolian reading materials.

Before liberation, the Mongolian people of Ikezhao League lived a painful life under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the reactionary ruling class of their own ethnic group, and had no opportunity to learn culture. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Mongolian people, with the development of production and the improvement of their lives, urgently demanded to learn culture. Now, we can often see two or three shepherds sitting together to learn culture. In Zhasake Banner, some shepherds ride their horses to catch up with cadres when they see them from a distance and ask them to teach them a few words. For example, in the first administrative village of the fifth district of Junwang Banner, before liberation, only two out of 101 Mongolians could read newspapers, but now more than 30 people can read popular reading materials. After Comrade Qi Jianhua created the accelerated literacy method, many Mongolians were very concerned about whether there was a Mongolian accelerated literacy method so that more Mongolians could quickly learn culture.

In this case, the problem of the lack of Mongolian reading materials becomes more serious. Many Mongolians who are actively learning culture are worried about this. Near Ganzu Temple in the second district of Junwang Banner, someone has not been able to buy a new book for a long time and has to repeatedly read an old newspaper. In Zhasake Banner, some people still know very few characters, and when they see a Mongolian book that they cannot understand, they quickly buy it and store it, fearing that they will not be able to buy it later.

Ikezhao League is an area where Mongolians and Hans live together. After liberation, the Han people's demand for learning culture has also increased. Many Mongolians also automatically learn Chinese because they have many opportunities to get along with the Han people. In this way, there is also a lack of Chinese reading materials. Some popular reading materials that can be bought in other places cannot be bought here. A few days ago, a comrade from the post office sold Chinese accelerated literacy textbooks on that hundred-meter-long street in Etuoke Banner (a purely pastoral area, a Mongolian settlement area). Before he reached the other end of the street, more than 1,000 books were sold out.

Now it is winter, which is a good time for our Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen to learn culture. We hope that the publishing and distribution departments can help us solve the difficulty of lacking reading materials.

    新疆和绥远伊克昭盟少数民族地区人民
    要求出版发行机关协助解决书籍缺乏的问题
    编者按：下面发表的新疆读者苗鲁平和绥远伊克昭盟读者撒格陆、牛凤鸣的两封来信中，一致反映了少数民族地区人民要求解决书籍缺乏问题的迫切心情。少数民族文字的书籍不够，这是旧社会遗留给我们的一个困难。过去长期的反动统治造成了少数民族文化落后的严重状况；解放后少数民族的人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，迫切要求迅速提高文化，本民族文字的书籍缺乏的问题就自然出现了。人民政府是重视这个问题的；但由于人力物力及其它条件的限制，这个问题还只能是逐步地、有计划地来解决。
    此外，两封来信中又共同指出：目前上述两少数民族地区书刊发行工作没有深入群众，也是造成书籍缺乏现象的原因之一。这个情况是值得重视的。在少数民族地区，大多幅员辽阔，交通不便，干部较少，这就形成了发行工作中的客观困难；但也正因为如此，书刊发行工作者就更需要有深入群众的艰苦工作作风。否则，就会使已经出版的书刊，也不能有效地送到读者手中。希望上述两地书刊发行机关注意这个问题，发扬深入群众的工作作风，创造切合实际的工作方法，为少数民族地区人民服务得更好。
    （一）
    编辑同志：我向你们反映新疆人民对有关文化生活方面的两个要求：
    一、新疆各少数民族的人民迫切需要有更多的本民族文字的读物。新疆的出版部门在这方面曾经做了很大的努力，但由于编译能力和其他条件的限制，此类读物尚不能大量出版。目前用各民族文字出版的书籍仅有朝鲜通讯集，毛主席、朱总司令的故事集和赵树理的“地板”等很少几种。这和各族人民的文化生活要求是极不相称的。
    过去反动统治阶级对各族人民长期实施压迫与分裂的政策，各少数民族人民对于祖国历史情况很不熟悉。两年来新疆曾出版了一些祖国历史的教科书，这对加强爱国主义教育起了很大的作用。但是有关历史的参考书，目前还十分缺乏。各族人民又普遍要求学习政治，像“学习”杂志社出版的“政治常识读本”一类书籍就十分需要印行少数民族文字版本。本省各校在讲授历史、地理及政治常识时，大部是一个人讲授、一个人翻译，所费时间很多。这和参考材料的缺乏是有关系的。目前新疆维吾尔、哈萨克等少数民族的青年学生很多，仅中学生就有两万余人；随着各族人民生活水平的提高，今后学生的人数更将大量增加，所需要的民族文字的读物也会跟着增加。我们殷切地希望出版机关努力满足各族人民的文化要求，更多地出版维吾尔、哈萨克等族文字的书籍。
    二、目前新疆地区的书刊供应工作与人民的需要距离很大，应该大大加强。新疆地区辽阔，交通条件较差，确实给书刊供应工作造成一定的困难。但是，书刊发行工作与群众要求脱节的主要原因，还是书刊发行人员没有艰苦地深入群众，而只把书刊发行工作停留在少数比较大的城市中。因此，一方面大批有价值的书籍“卖不出去”，原封不动地被“囚禁”在书库里，既积压了国家资金，又使新的书刊长时期来不了；另一方面，广大人民要买书却又买不到。如最近新疆省农牧民代表会上，代表们指出：各地冬学课本很缺，特别是游牧区，有的地方六十余人共看一本书。但新华书店塔城支店有二千本冬学课本，只在城里卖了一百本，积压了一千九百本；迪化新华书店积压了四万本，还想往回退或按滞销货特价出卖。新华书店一个工作人员听到代表们的话以后，惊奇地说：“我们的书卖不了，怎么代表们说书不够！”这里，介绍这样的一个事实：新华书店哈密支店有一个工作人员骑着马，带了些书到农牧区去推销。他原来认为要跑几个村子才能把这些书卖掉；但他刚到头一个村子，所有的书都被抢购一空了。可惜这种深入群众的工作作风没有被有关领导机关重视，及时予以表扬和推广。
    目前新疆各地区不能普遍设立书店，要使大量的书刊及时供应到边远的农牧区去，必须进行一系列的艰苦工作。应该争取一切可能争取的力量，如利用合作社和其他深入牧区的贸易机构，使他们共同为供应各民族人民所需的文化食粮而努力。

    编辑同志：我们伊克昭盟自治区的广大蒙汉农牧人民迫切要求出版发行机关帮助我们解决读物、特别是蒙文读物缺乏的问题。
    解放前，伊克昭盟蒙族人民在国民党反动政府和本族反动统治阶级的压迫下，过着痛苦的生活，没有学习文化的机会。解放后，在共产党领导下，蒙族人民随着生产的发展和生活的提高，就迫切地要求学习文化了。现在，我们经常能看到三三两两的放羊人聚坐在一起学习文化。在扎萨克旗，有些放羊娃远远看到一个干部，就骑马赶去，请他教几个字。如郡王旗五区一行政村一百零一个蒙民中，解放前只有两个人能读懂报纸，现在已有三十多人可读通俗读物了。祁建华同志创造速成识字法后，有不少蒙族人民非常关心地探询有没有蒙文速成识字法，这样可以使更多的蒙族人民很快学会文化。
    在这种情况下，蒙文读物缺乏的问题就更严重了。许多积极学习文化的蒙族人民都为此发愁。在郡王旗二区甘祖庙附近，有人很久买不到一本新书，只好反复地阅读一张旧报。在扎萨克旗，有些人现在认得的字还很少，见到一本自己虽然看不懂的蒙文书也赶快买了存起来，怕以后买不到。
    伊克昭盟是个蒙汉杂居的地区。解放后，汉族人民学习文化的要求也同样地提高了；许多蒙族人民因为和汉族人民相处的机会很多，也自动学习汉文。这样，汉文读物也同样感到缺乏；有些地方可以买到的通俗读物，我们这里也买不到。前些日子，邮局的一位同志在鄂托克旗（纯牧区，是蒙族聚居区）那条一百多公尺长的街上卖汉文速成识字课本，从这头还没走到那头，一千多本书就卖光了。
    现在已是冬季，正是我们蒙汉农牧民学习文化的好时节，希望出版发行部门能够帮助我们解决缺乏读物的困难。
