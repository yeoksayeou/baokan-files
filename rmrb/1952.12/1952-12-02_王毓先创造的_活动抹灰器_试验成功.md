To the Editor: Wang Yuxian, a plasterer at the First Engineering Department of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company, has created an "active plastering machine" based on the principle of Fu Hongbin's "mortar spreading device," which has increased work efficiency by 1.7 times compared to the quota.

In the past, using Yang Dezhong's "mortar dragging board" for plastering required two coats (one for the base and one for leveling the thickness); however, using the "active plastering machine" only requires one coat. In the past, a skilled worker could only plaster sixteen or seventeen square meters per day; now, a skilled worker can plaster more than twenty-five square meters per day. In the past, the quality of plastering was very poor, with uneven wall surfaces differing by as much as three or four centimeters, uneven corners, and uneven joints, requiring the use of a "wooden float" to smooth them out after plastering. Now, there is no need to use a "wooden float," and the quality can be 100% qualified.

Currently, in the First Engineering Department of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company, some ordinary workers, after a few tens of minutes of training, can use the "active plastering machine." Zhang Shaoquan

    王毓先创造的“活动抹灰器”试验成功
    编辑同志：东北工业部建设工程公司第一工程处抹灰工王毓先，根据傅鸿宾创造“铺灰器”的原理，创制了“活动抹灰器”，使工作效率比定额提高了一点七倍。
    过去用杨德重的“拖灰板”抹灰需要抹两次（一次打底，一次找厚平）；但使用“活动抹灰器”抹灰，一次可以抹好。过去一个技工抹灰，每天只能抹十六、七平方米；现在一个技工一天就可以抹二十五平方米以上。过去抹灰质量很坏，如墙面凸凹相差三、四公分之多，涡角不直，接槎不平，抹完后还得用“木抹子”撮平，现在不用“木抹子”撮，质量可以百分之百合格。
    目前东北工业部建设工程公司第一工程处，有些普通工人，经过几十分钟的训练，就会使用“活动抹灰器”了。　张绍全
