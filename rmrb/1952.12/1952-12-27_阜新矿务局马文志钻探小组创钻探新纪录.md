    Fuxin Mining Bureau's Ma Wenzhi Drilling Team Sets New Drilling Record
    Comrade Editor: The Ma Wenzhi Advanced Drilling Team of the Northeast Fuxin Mining Bureau set a new record of 49.020 meters drilled per day while completing their fourth-quarter task. The reason for the new record, in addition to the team's specific action plan, is mainly the study of advanced Soviet experience. In the team's fourth-quarter work, in addition to continuing to implement their own team's advanced experience, they also learned from the Soviet "pendulum-type drill bit" experience, which doubled their work efficiency compared to the past. Secondly, they rationally organized labor and implemented an assembly-line operation method. Before work, they rationally divided labor according to each person's strengths, which made the work orderly and reduced non-productive time by 30 percent.
    Ma Wenzhi's team completed the state task three months ahead of schedule on September 1st and guaranteed to overfulfill the fourth-quarter task by 900 meters.

    阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组创钻探新纪录
    编辑同志：东北阜新矿务局马文志先进钻探小组，在完成第四季任务中，创日进四九点零二零公尺的新纪录。创新纪录的原因，除全组有具体的行动计划外，主要是学习了苏联的先进经验。在全组第四季度工作中，除继续贯彻了自己组的先进经验外，还学习了苏联的“摆骨式钻头”经验，使工作效率较前提高一倍。其次，是合理地组织了劳动力，实行了流水作业法。工作前，按各人的特长进行合理分工，使工作有顺序，减少了百分之三十的非生产时间。
    马文志小组在九月一日已提前三个月完成了国家任务，并保证第四季超额完成九百公尺的任务。
