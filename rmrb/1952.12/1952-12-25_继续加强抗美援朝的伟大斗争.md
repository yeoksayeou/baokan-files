    The vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which the Chinese people have engaged in for more than two years, has achieved brilliant results. The finest sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—have fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front and won great victories: defeating the American aggressors and reversing the Korean war situation. Under Chairman Mao's call to "Increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life across the country have striven to be the first, participating in the construction of the motherland with selfless labor, thereby advancing our industry, agriculture, and other fronts by leaps and bounds, which has given the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea inexhaustible material strength. Last year's nationwide donation campaign for airplanes and cannons, which helped our People's Volunteers improve their technical equipment, is a clear example. The Chinese people have repeatedly organized comfort missions to the front lines to convey the Chinese people's love and concern to the Chinese and Korean people's forces, giving the Chinese and Korean people's forces tremendous encouragement.
    Thanks to the full support of the people of the motherland, and thanks to the Chinese and Korean people's forces' high degree of great internationalism and patriotism, as well as their heroic and tenacious fighting style, the Korean front has been completely stabilized near the 38th parallel, and the enemy cannot advance an inch no matter how much sacrifice they pay. This has provided a strong guarantee for the independence and freedom of the Korean people and the peaceful construction of our motherland. People see that if we had not promptly carried out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, if the finest sons and daughters of our motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteers—had not promptly gone to the Korean front to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, the mad American aggressors would have continued to invade and trample on our motherland's beautiful rivers and mountains, the people of our motherland, the kind parents and lively younger siblings of the people of the motherland, would have suffered the murder of demons, and our beloved motherland would not have been able to carry out peaceful construction. Therefore, the people of the whole country wholeheartedly love our Volunteers, calling them our "most beloved people," and vigorously launch the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea everywhere, actively supporting our "most beloved people."
    The China Peace Committee’s “Instructions on Continuing to Strengthen the Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea” calls on us to do a good job in four central tasks, namely: continuing to deepen ideological education in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, strengthening the patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift, conscientiously doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, and conscientiously doing a good job in supply and comfort work. These four tasks should become the central tasks of our people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the future. We must deeply understand that without the heroic sacrifices and arduous struggles of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, the peaceful construction of our country would not be possible; at the same time, as the facts of the past two years have proved, the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is also a great driving force for all aspects of our country's construction. In the past, the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea not only did not cause the interruption of our country's economic recovery and transformation, but on the contrary, further promoted the successful completion of this work. Our country has now entered a new period of large-scale economic construction under the conditions of continuing the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and we believe that by relying on the close combination of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the cause of national construction, we will surely be able to win victories in both aspects.
    Now, although the American aggressors have suffered heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people's forces, these mad robbers have not yet accepted the lessons of their defeat and restrained their ambitions. American monopoly capitalists, in order to pursue maximum profits and attempt to escape the impending economic crisis, are continuing to rush towards the path of expanding the war of aggression. Eisenhower has accepted the intentions of the monopoly capitalists and is planning an adventurous plan to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. The war clamor of the United States is even more insane than before. Eisenhower's spokesmen have openly shouted that the American people should bear "more sacrifices." According to a United Press dispatch: After Eisenhower's visit to Korea, "America's new and powerful Far East military strategy is beginning to take shape." American "senior military officials fully support the opinions of Eisenhower and other senior Republican leaders in the new government, believing that it is necessary to seize the initiative of the Far East hot war from the Communists." At the same time, after the United States manipulated the United Nations' voting machine to pass an illegal resolution on the Korean issue regarding the forced detention of prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Conventions based on the Indian proposal, on the one hand, it prepared to use this illegal resolution to extort more cannon fodder from its accomplices, and the number one accomplice, Britain, has agreed to send an additional armored division to Korea to support the United States in launching a "limited offensive"; on the other hand, the United States has begun to persecute and slaughter prisoners of war more barbarously and inhumanely in order to achieve the vile goal of forcibly detaining them and driving them to become American mercenaries. The United States unilaterally suspended the Korean armistice negotiations precisely because it wanted to let go and launch new military adventures.
    Therefore, our work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea must not be slackened in the slightest, and we must immediately pay attention to continuing to strengthen this work. We must use the opportunity of the comfort missions to convey to the people everywhere the victory on the Korean front and expose and shatter the US imperialists’ heinous plan to frantically prepare for expanding the war of aggression. All parts of the country should universally establish and improve the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, and normalize the patriotic education of the people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea through the "Patriotic Inspection Day." In continuing to carry out the patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift, we must regularly combine the movement to increase production and practice thrift with the masses' education in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families must be earnestly inspected before the Spring Festival next year. The good ones should be commended and promoted, and the bad ones should be criticized and corrected. All sectors of the country should attach importance to the supply and comfort work for the Volunteers, and convey the love and concern of the people of the motherland to them through this work, so that this work can truly become an important link in boosting morale.

### 继续加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争

    继续加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争
    中国人民两年多以来轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，已经收到了辉煌的成绩。中国人民最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，得到了伟大的胜利：打败了美国侵略者，扭转了朝鲜的战局。在毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召下，全国工人农民以及各阶层人民无不争先恐后，以忘我的劳动积极参加祖国的建设，使我国工业、农业以及其他各个战线上的工作都一日千里地前进，从而使抗美援朝斗争有了无穷无尽的物质力量。去年遍及全国的捐献飞机大炮运动，帮助我人民志愿军改善了技术装备，就是一个显明的例证。中国人民一再组织赴朝慰问团到前线慰问，向中、朝人民部队传达了中国人民对他们的热爱和关怀，给中、朝人民部队以莫大的鼓舞。
    由于祖国人民的全力支持，由于中、朝人民部队高度发扬了伟大的国际主义与爱国主义精神和英勇顽强的战斗作风，朝鲜的战线已经在“三八线”附近完全稳定下来了，敌人不论付出多少牺牲的代价都无法前进一步了。这样，就使朝鲜人民的独立自由与我们祖国的和平建设，获得了有力的保障。人们都看到，假如我们不及时地进行抗美援朝运动，假如我们祖国最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军没有及时开赴朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，疯狂的美国侵略者就将继续侵入与践踏我们祖国的锦绣河山，我们祖国的人民，祖国人民慈祥的父母和活泼的弟弟妹妹们就将遭受魔鬼们的杀害，我们可爱的祖国就不可能进行和平建设。所以全国的人民都衷心热爱我们的志愿军，称志愿军是我们“最可爱的人”，到处热火朝天地展开抗美援朝运动，积极支援我们“最可爱的人”。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会发布的“关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示”，号召我们做好四项中心工作，这就是：继续深入抗美援朝思想教育，加强爱国增产节约运动，认真做好拥军优属工作，切实做好供应和慰问工作。这四项工作应该成为我国人民抗美援朝运动在今后的中心任务。我们必须深刻认识，没有中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英勇牺牲、艰苦奋战，我们国家的和平建设就不可能进行；同时，正如两年来的事实所证明的，抗美援朝斗争还是我们国家各方面建设工作的一个伟大的推动力量。抗美援朝斗争在过去不但没有引起我国经济恢复与改造工作的中断，相反的，更加促进了这个工作的胜利完成。我们国家现在在还要继续抗美援朝斗争的条件下，进入了大规模经济建设的新时期，我们相信，依靠着抗美援朝斗争和国家建设事业的密切结合，我们一定能够争取这两个方面的胜利。
    现在，美国侵略者虽然已经受了中、朝人民部队所给予的沉重的打击，但是，这些疯狂的强盗们还没有接受他们失败的教训而收敛他们的野心。美国垄断资本家为追求最大限度的利润和企图逃脱即将到来的经济危机，正继续向着扩大侵略战争的道路急奔。艾森豪威尔接受了垄断资本家的意旨，正在策划着继续和扩大对朝鲜的侵略战争的冒险计划。美国的战争叫嚣又比以前更加疯狂了。艾森豪威尔的发言人已经公开喊叫美国人民要负担“更多的牺牲”。据合众社电：艾森豪威尔访问朝鲜后，“美国的新的、强有力的远东军事战略正开始粗具规模”。美国“高级军事官员完全支持艾森豪威尔和新政府中其他高级共和党领袖的意见，认为必须从共产党人手里，抢过远东热战的主动权来”。同时，美国操纵联合国的表决机器根据印度提案通过破坏日内瓦公约强迫扣留战俘的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议后，一面准备利用这一非法决议向帮凶国勒索更多炮灰，头号帮凶英国已答应加派一个装甲师到朝鲜去支持美国发动“有限度的攻势”；另一方面，美国已开始更野蛮更惨无人道地迫害和屠杀战俘，以达到强迫扣留并驱使他们当美国的雇佣兵的卑污的目的。美国片面停止了朝鲜停战谈判，正是因为它要放手发动新的军事冒险。
    因此，我们的抗美援朝工作决不容许丝毫松懈，我们必须马上注意继续加强这个工作。我们必须利用慰问团到各处传达的机会，广泛地向人民宣传朝鲜前线的胜利，揭露与粉碎美帝国主义疯狂准备扩大侵略战争的罪恶计划。全国各地应普遍建立并健全“爱国检查日”的制度，通过“爱国检查日”把人民群众的抗美援朝的爱国主义教育正常化起来。在继续开展爱国增产节约运动中，我们要把增产节约运动经常地与群众的抗美援朝教育结合起来。对于拥军优属的工作，必须在明年春节以前切实进行检查，好的应表扬和推广，不好的应批评和纠正。全国各界都应该重视对志愿军的供应和慰问工作，通过这一工作传达祖国人民对他们的热爱与关怀，使这个工作真正成为鼓舞士气的重要环节。
