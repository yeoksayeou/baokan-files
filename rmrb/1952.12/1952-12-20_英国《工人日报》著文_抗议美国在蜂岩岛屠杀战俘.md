    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from TASS, London, 18th: The "Daily Worker" published an article angrily protesting the bloody massacre of Chinese and Korean POWs by American executioners in the Koje Island POW camp. The newspaper emphasized that, according to the POW camp commander's admission, the Americans' reason for massacring the POWs was because the POWs were singing. The newspaper reported that the Britain-China Friendship Association on December 16th called on all groups to firmly protest this massacre and strive for an immediate end to military action in Korea. A commentator for the "Daily Mirror" wrote: "Has no one told Clark that this horrific massacre is absolutely intolerable? This time the Americans tell us that the massacre was the result of a riot. Obviously, this is just a cover-up." The "Daily Express" wrote: "It has only been three years since the United States and Britain signed the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The Convention clearly stipulates that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the cessation of hostilities. What reason do Britain and the United States have for detaining prisoners of war who should be repatriated?"

    抗议美国在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦十八日讯：《工人日报》刊载了一篇文章，愤怒地抗议美国刽子手对蜂岩岛战俘营中的中朝战俘的血腥屠杀。报纸着重说，据战俘营司令的承认，美国人屠杀战俘的理由是战俘唱歌。报纸报道，英中友好协会在十二月十六日号召一切团体坚决抗议这种大屠杀，争取立刻停止在朝鲜的军事行动。《每日镜报》评论员写道：“难道没有一个人告诉克拉克，这种恐怖的屠杀是决不能容忍的吗？这一次美国人对我们说，屠杀是由于暴动的结果。显然，这只是掩饰的口实而已。”《每日快报》写道：“美国与英国在日内瓦签署关于战俘待遇的公约以后，才过了三年。公约明确规定，在停止军事行动后应立即释放与遣返战俘。英国和美国扣留应予遣返的战俘，究竟有什么理由呢？”
