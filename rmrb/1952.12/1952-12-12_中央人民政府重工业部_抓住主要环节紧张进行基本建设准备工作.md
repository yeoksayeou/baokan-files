Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry
Seizes Key Links to Intensify Preparations for Basic Construction

    To implement the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government is currently focusing on five key links to vigorously launch preparations for large-scale construction.

    Conducting Thorough Ideological Mobilization

    The first is to conduct thorough ideological mobilization. The leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry believes that: it is crucial to ensure that all cadres understand the importance of basic construction, truly comprehend why basic construction should be given top priority, and achieve ideological consensus from top to bottom. This is the key to whether we can smoothly gather strength and effectively implement this policy. Therefore, they first seized this link. After the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council held a basic construction meeting, the Ministry of Heavy Industry immediately convened a joint meeting of bureau directors and department heads. Minister Wang Heshou, drawing on his experience in the Northeast over the past few years, conveyed Comrade Chen Yun's instructions, emphasizing that the best cadres must be transferred to basic construction and that the basic construction organization must be the strongest. At the bi-weekly senior cadre study sessions, in conjunction with the study of the "Party" section of Comrade Malenkov's report, it was repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must change their subjective deployments with the changes in objective circumstances, otherwise they will lose their leadership role. Originally, cadres at the bureau and department level generally recognized the policy of giving top priority to basic construction, but after this meeting and study, the understanding deepened. For example, some bureaus originally drafted plans that were relatively dispersed in the use of investment. Now, they are proactively changing their investment plans, reducing minor projects and expenses for repairs and patching in production. Some bureau directors reviewed that their past understanding of this policy was not deep enough, so they were not bold enough to transfer cadres from production, and therefore failed to do a better job in this year's basic construction work. After the bureau and department level cadres reached ideological consensus, a meeting of factory and mine directors was then convened, where Minister Wang Heshou made a systematic mobilization report based on the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, combined with the specific circumstances of the department, and organized discussions. This meeting was very effective. The outstanding manifestation was that everyone was willing to send a large number of the best cadres to basic construction. In addition to the leading cadres of the basic construction units, most of the participants in this meeting came from production factories and mines. Before the meeting, most cadres still prioritized production in their thinking, hoping to get more investment in production and try to reduce the number of cadres transferred. After this meeting, everyone recognized the importance of basic construction, established a global perspective, and actively proposed targets for sending cadres to basic construction at the meeting. Generally, they planned to draw out more than 50 percent of the old cadres and technical personnel to basic construction; and they expressed that they would conduct in-depth ideological mobilization among all employees after returning to the factories and mines to ensure that this policy would be implemented to the end.

    Compiling and Determining Next Year's Investment Plan

    The second link that the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry focused on was the compilation and determination of the 1953 investment plan. Because the annual investment plan is not only a concrete action program for the entire basic construction department—including design, engineering, planning, equipment, finance and all other departments, under whose organization millions of employees will act; but more importantly because this plan is a concrete embodiment of the national basic construction policy and is the beginning of large-scale long-term construction. If the focus of investment and the proportion of investment in various parts of this plan are not carefully considered, or are not proposed appropriately, it will cause irreparable errors in future construction. At the same time, it is also necessary to carefully consider whether the construction plan of each key project has maximized the effectiveness of national investment in economic terms. Therefore, the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry used great attention to lead this work. Detailed discussions were held on each important investment, and specific construction plans were studied for each key project. It took a month, and the entire plan was repeatedly discussed four times, three of which were personally chaired by the minister. Finally, it was determined that the investment focus would be on several projects with decisive significance such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, as well as geological exploration and the training of reserve forces; secondary and sporadic projects, and projects where the geological resource situation has not been finally clarified, were reduced or postponed. These reduced investments accounted for more than 20 percent of the total investment, so that the construction of key projects in 1953 could be guaranteed to be completed by concentrating forces.

    Strengthening Geological Work

    The third link is to strengthen geological work. Developing heavy industry is the fundamental way to expand social reproduction and achieve national industrialization; and to develop heavy industry and build huge steel plants and non-ferrous metal smelting plants, we must first have detailed and accurate underground resource materials, and then we can determine the location, scale and specific technical equipment for the construction of the plant. The backward old China could not leave us with relatively comprehensive and detailed geological data. Now there are many places where we know that underground resources are very rich, and we urgently need to start developing them according to national requirements, but because we have not mastered the specific reserves, we cannot start designing. In other words, if we do not immediately start strengthening the exploration and drilling of geological resources, the design for the second year will not be possible, and the country's construction will be greatly delayed. Therefore, geological work is the decisive link in whether the country's long-term construction plan can be completed on time. In 1953, the Ministry of Heavy Industry's investment in this area accounted for a very large proportion, and the tasks of exploration and drilling were extremely heavy. In order to complete this huge plan, we are currently concentrating our efforts to speed up training. The Ministry of Heavy Industry system originally had about 2,000 people in geology, surveying, analysis and drilling. It is planned to increase this fivefold by the end of 1953. The number of drilling machines is planned to be increased more than fourfold, and orders are being expedited.

    Gathering Strength and Strengthening Institutions

    The fourth important task is to gather strength and strengthen institutions. After the policy plan is determined, organizational work becomes the decisive factor in realizing the plan. If the basic construction departments are not seriously strengthened in terms of personnel and institutions, "giving top priority to basic construction" is just empty talk. Therefore, the Ministry of Heavy Industry is urging various systems to transfer cadres and technical personnel from production. In the steel bureau system, it is initially planned to transfer 149 old cadres before "September 3rd" from steel plants in Guannei (areas within the passes), 610 general business cadres, and a total of 1,045 technical personnel from North China, Central and South China, East China, and Southwest China. At present, various specialized bureaus and various factories and mines under them are conducting in-depth ideological mobilization, formulating plans, and actively transferring strength to basic construction. According to the requirements of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the design force will be concentrated before the end of December, and other personnel will be transferred at the latest by the end of January next year.

    Preparing for Next Year's Basic Construction Work

    The last thing is the direct preparation for next year's basic construction. In terms of design, the units in Guannei are currently preparing project task books, and the Northeast is carrying out preliminary design and technical design. In addition to grasping the review of designs and preparing for foreign designs, the leaders of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are currently paying special attention to inspecting and supervising the work of compiling design progress plans by various units - that is, determining when to hand over which drawings to the construction department, and formulating concrete progress plans from the entire design department to each designer to ensure timely completion. If this work is done well, it will play a decisive role in ensuring that construction starts on schedule next year and that the construction department takes the initiative in its work and organizes construction in an orderly manner. In terms of construction preparation, equipment needed for next year's key projects has been planned and is being discussed for ordering; advance payments for building materials are being allocated to actively purchase them. Next year's engineering tasks have been assigned to various engineering companies, and forces have been redeployed according to the weight of the tasks. For example, the civil construction force of the Jilin Engineering Company of the Chemical Industry Bureau is preparing to enter Guannei to support the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant; the Third Engineering Office of the directly affiliated Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry stationed in Changchun is supporting Anshan Iron and Steel; the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Engineering Companies are allocated to the Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Bureau. At present, various engineering companies have begun to compile technical construction financial plans, preparing to implement planned management in construction in a comprehensive and top-down manner, and strengthen the economic accounting system. In addition, in conjunction with the trade union, the work of summarizing experience has been vigorously organized. Advanced experiences such as the parallel flow operation organized according to the instructions of the drawings, the establishment of the responsibility system, the civil construction flow operation, and the pre-installation of machinery and equipment, which were created in this year's construction or successfully learned from the Soviet Union, will be systematically summarized and used to educate the vast number of grassroots cadres and fixed workers in the winter training work to greatly improve the construction force and the leadership level and technical level of construction next year.

    中央人民政府重工业部
    抓住主要环节紧张进行基本建设准备工作
    中央人民政府重工业部为贯彻政务院财政经济委员会的指示，目前正抓住五个重要环节，紧张地展开了迎接大规模建设的准备工作。
    进行充分的思想动员
    第一件是进行充分的思想动员。重工业部的领导上认为：使全体干部都了解基本建设的重要性，真正领会为什么要把基本建设放到首要地位来，从上到下思想取得一致，乃是能否顺利地集结力量，切实贯彻这一方针的关键。因此，他们首先抓住了这一环节，在政务院财政经济委员会召开基本建设会议之后，重工业部立即召开了局长与司长联席会议，由王鹤寿部长联系东北几年来的经验，传达了陈云同志的指示，强调要把最好的干部抽调给基本建设方面，一定要使基本建设的机构成为最强的机构。在每周两次的高级干部学习会上，又结合着对马林科夫同志报告中“党”的部分的学习，反复强调领导干部必须随着客观情况的变化而改变主观上的部署，否则就将失去自己的领导作用。本来，局、司一级的干部一般地是认识了要把基本建设放在首要地位这一方针的，但经过这次会议和学习，认识又深刻了一步。例如有的局原来订的计划对投资的使用仍比较分散，现在则主动地改变了投资计划，把次要的工程和用于生产上修修补补的费用都削减了。有的局长检讨自己过去对这一方针领会得不够深刻，从生产中抽调干部时气魄就不够大，因此没有能够把今年的基本建设工作搞得更好。在局、司长一级干部思想取得一致之后，紧接着又召开厂矿长会议，由王鹤寿部长根据政务院财政经济委员会的指示，结合本部门的具体情况，作了系统的动员报告，并组织了讨论。这次会议收效很大，突出的表现在大家都愿意把大量的最好的干部输送给基本建设方面去。参加这次会议的，除了基本建设单位的领导干部外，大部分都是生产厂矿来的。开会之前，大多数干部的思想上还是把生产放在首要地位，希望在生产方面多要一点投资，干部则尽量少抽
    一些。经过这次会议，大家都认识到了基本建设的重要性，树立了全局观点，在会上纷纷提出向基本建设方面输送干部的指标，一般的都计划要抽出百分之五十以上的老干部、技术人员给基本建设；并表示回厂矿后要向全体职工深入地进行思想动员，保证把这一方针一直贯彻到底。编制和确定明年投资计划
    重工业部领导上抓住的第二个环节是编制和确定一九五三年的投资计划。因为年度的投资计划不仅仅是整个基本建设部门——包括设计、工程、计划、设备、财务等一切部门的具体行动纲领，千百万职工将在它的组织下行动；而且更重要的是因为这个计划乃是国家基本建设方针、政策的具体体现，是大规模的长期建设的开端，如果这个计划中投资的重点和各部分投资的比例考虑得不周密，提得不恰当，就会给今后的建设造成不可补救的错误。同时，每一件重点工程的建设计划，是否在经济上最大限度地发挥了国家投资的效能，也是必须加以缜密考虑的。因此重工业部的领导上用了极大的注意力来领导这项工作，对每一项重要的投资都进行了详尽的讨论，对每一项重点工程都研究了具体的建设方针，前后历时一个月，全部计划反复讨论了四次，其中有三次都是在部长亲自主持下进行的。最后确定了以鞍山钢铁公司等数项有决定意义的工程及地质勘察、培养后备力量三项为投资重点；次要的零星的工程以及地质资源情况还没有最后弄清楚的工程都削减或推迟了。这些削减掉的投资约占投资总额的百分之二十以上，这样就使得一九五三年重点工程的建设将能够集中力量保证完成。
    加强地质工作
    第三个环节是加强地质工作。发展重工业乃是扩大社会再生产、达成国家工业化的根本道路；而要发展重工业，建设巨大的钢铁厂和有色金属冶炼厂，首先必须要有详细的、确实的地下资源材料，然后才能确定建厂的地点、规模和具体的技术设备。落后的旧中国不可能给我们遗留下来比较全面的详细的地质资料，现在就有不少地方，知道地下资源很丰富，根据国家要求急需动手开发，但是因为我们没有掌握具体的埋藏量，就无从着手进行设计。换句话说，如果目前不立即着手加强地质资源的勘察钻探工作，第二年的设计就不可能进行，国家的建设就要大大推迟。因此，地质工作乃是国家长期建设计划能否按时完成的决定性环节。一九五三年，重工业部在这方面的投资占了极大的比重，勘察钻探的任务极为繁重。为了完成这一巨大的计划，目前正在集中力量，加紧进行培养和训练。重工业部系统原有地质、测绘、分析及钻工等人员共约二千人，计划到一九五三年底增加到五倍。钻机准备再增加四倍多，目前正在抓紧订货。
    集结力量，加强机构
    第四件重要工作是集结力量，加强机构。方针计划确定之后，组织工作就成了实现计划的决定因素。如果不在人员、机构上认真地加强基本建设部门，“基本建设放在首要地位”只不过是一句空话。因此重工业部正督促各系统从生产中调干部及技术人员，在钢铁局系统，已初步计划从关内各钢铁厂抽调出“九三”以前的老干部一百四十九名，一般业务干部六百一十名，从华北、中南、华东、西南等地共抽调技术人员一千零四十五名。目前各专业局与下面各个厂矿都在深入地进行思想动员，拟订计划，积极向基本建设方面输送力量。根据重工业部的要求，设计力量将在十二月底以前集中，其他人员至迟也将在明年一月底以前调齐。
    准备明年基本建设工作
    最后一件就是明年基本建设的直接准备工作。在设计方面，目前关内各单位正在做计划任务书，东北已在进行初步设计与技术设计。重工业部领导方面除抓紧审查设计和进行国外设计的准备工作外，目前特别重视了检查和督促各单位编制设计进度计划的工作——即确定什么时候给施工部门交出哪些图纸，从整个设计部门直到每个设计人员，都订出具体的进度计划，保证按时完成。这件工作如果做得好，将对保证明年按期开工和使施工部门工作取得主动，做到有条不紊地组织施工起决定性的作用。在施工的准备方面，明年重点工程所需的设备既已提出计划，正在商洽订货；建筑材料的预付款正在拨付。以便积极购置。明年的工程任务，已给各工程公司分好，并根据任务的轻重，重新调配了力量。如化学工业局吉林工程公司的土木建筑力量准备进关支援太原钢铁厂；驻长春的重工业部直属工程公司第三工程处支援鞍钢；第二、第四、第五三个工程公司则拨给有色金属工业局。目前各工程公司已开始编制技术建设财务计划，准备全面地、自上而下地在施工中实行计划管理，加强经济核算制。此外，并联合工会方面，大力组织了总结经验的工作，诸如今年施工中所创造的或向苏联学习成功的按指示图组织平行流水作业、建立责任制、土木建筑流水作业、以及机器设备的预安装等先进经验，均将系统地总结出来，在即要大规模展开的冬训工作中用以教育广大的基层干部和固定工人，以把明年的施工力量和施工的领导水平及技术水平大大提高一步。
