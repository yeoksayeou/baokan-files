    Nationwide Cadre Study of Stalin's Works and Documents of the CPSU Congress

    [This newspaper dispatch] The study of Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU has been launched across the country and has generated enthusiasm among the vast number of cadres.

    After the translations of the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU and Comrade Stalin's works were published in China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions in October and November respectively, calling on all Party members and cadres to study them with great effort. The Central Committee of the CPC pointed out in its first instruction: "The convening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great international and historical significance. Comrade Stalin's speech at the Congress and the various reports and documents of the Congress have profoundly and correctly analyzed the current world situation, elucidated the concrete path for the Soviet Union to move from socialism to communism, and pointed out a clear direction for the struggle of the working people of the world for peace, democracy, and socialism. All our Party cadres should pay great attention to seriously studying Stalin's speech and the main documents of the Congress, and lead and organize the non-Party staff in state organs, enterprises, and schools to study together." The Central Committee of the CPC also pointed out that the main purpose of the study is to enable cadres to understand the world situation, understand the development of the Soviet Union, and understand the significance of Soviet communist construction for defending world peace; to enable cadres to better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in various fields, and to improve their work based on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and to strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism. In the instruction calling on the entire Party to study "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the Central Committee of the CPC emphasized that "this work is an important development of Marxism" and "has great guiding significance for our country's upcoming large-scale economic construction." The Central Committee of the CPC required senior Party cadres to first seriously study this work in order to guide the study of general Party members and non-Party personnel. The Central Committee of the CPC instructed leading cadres at all levels to personally be responsible for mobilizing, arranging, and leading this study, stipulating study plans, instructing study points, inspecting study situations, answering study difficulties, and leading prepared and practical discussions.

    Leading Party organizations at all levels and the vast number of cadres responded to the call of the Central Committee with great enthusiasm. The leading organs of the central organs of the Party and the various departments of the Central People's Government, the central bureaus, and the provincial and municipal Party committees, respectively issued specific instructions on the study, and the heads of Party organizations at all levels convened cadre meetings to report on the great significance of the study. According to incomplete statistics, the number of cadres participating in the study was 76,000 in Beijing, more than 136,000 in the Northeast Region, and more than 163,000 in the Central South Region. The number of senior cadres participating in the study was more than 2,000 in Beijing, 2,000 in the Northeast, 800 in North China, and more than 1,400 in the Central South.

    Most Party organizations have decided to spend four months or more studying Comrade Stalin's works and Comrade Malenkov's report, first seeking to thoroughly read and fully understand the documents themselves, and then conducting further in-depth research. Under the current conditions in our country, in order to ensure the time for study, many units have stipulated that three hours each afternoon for two afternoons per week will be study time. This method has proven to be important for learning under the current working conditions.

    In this study, many leading cadres are able to lead seriously. The past situation where senior cadres lacked regular study has begun to change significantly. All Party cadres feel that they must earnestly study the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU and Comrade Stalin's great works in order to meet the upcoming great economic construction tasks of China. The results of the Central Committee's inspection of the theoretical study of senior cadres in more than 20 units in Beijing in early December showed that the study in each unit was conducted under the leadership of the main responsible cadres. The main responsible cadres of the central bureaus and provincial and municipal committees have also become the main leaders of this study.

    In order to help the vast number of cadres and the masses deepen their understanding of Comrade Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU, the organs in Beijing invited Soviet professors to give a series of lectures. Responsible comrades in various places have given many lectures and reports to cadres and the masses. Lin Feng, Zhang Xiushan, and Zhang Mingyuan, deputy secretaries of the Northeast Bureau, made systematic study reports. Zhang Ziyi, Minister of Propaganda of the Southwest Bureau, Fang Fang, Fifth Secretary of the South China Sub-bureau, Fu Zhensheng, Deputy Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, Li Jianbai, Minister of Propaganda of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, Tao Lujia, Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Li Yaqun of the Xikang Provincial Party Committee all gave lectures to cadres. The Chengdu Municipal Party Committee also organized 50 comrades to carry out broader dissemination. The Propaganda Department of the Shandong Sub-bureau, the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee of the First-Level Organs of East China used radio stations to hold multiple lectures, inviting responsible cadres to give lectures and answer study questions. Anhui People's Broadcasting Station also held lectures. The Central South People's Broadcasting Station rebroadcast the recording of the study mobilization report of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee. Various forums and discussions are being widely conducted in various places. According to the statistics of 74 branches directly under the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, 370 large group discussions and no less than 700 small group discussions have already been held.

    Due to the widespread development of the study, Comrade Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU have been widely distributed across the country. According to incomplete statistics at the end of November, 960,000 copies of Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" have been issued, 580,000 copies of Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the CPSU have been issued, and 990,000 copies of Malenkov's report have been issued. The Mongolian translation of Malenkov's report has been published in the Mongolian newspaper in Gui Sui. Regarding the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU, in addition to all the reports and speeches of the original members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU having been published in the People's Daily and newspapers across the country, other translated and published materials include: the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Saburov's report on the instructions of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan, instructions on the Fifth Five-Year Plan, Suslov's speech, Mikhailov's speech, Kuznetsov's speech, Fadeyev's speech, and Ilyichev's speech.

    Major newspapers in various places widely reprinted the People's Daily editorial calling for the study of Comrade Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU. Study magazine published an editorial calling for this study to be linked to practical work. The Literary Gazette, published on November 10, proposed to literary and art workers across the country the task of seriously studying Stalin's works. Many other important journals and newspapers, such as China Youth, World Knowledge, New Construction, Guangming Daily, Northeast Daily, Masses Daily, Shanghai Dagong Daily, and Wenhui Bao, published many materials, annotations, notes, and study papers to help with the study. The People's Daily, Workers' Daily, and the Study Translation Series published many papers translated from the Soviet Pravda, Labor Daily, and Philosophy Problems magazine to help study Stalin's works.

    Not only Party and government cadres, teachers, and students have participated in this study upsurge, but also cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and cadres of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are engaged in the intense battle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called on and organized democratic people from all walks of life to participate in the study in November. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Construction Association, the China Democratic Promotion Association, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Jiusan Society, and other democratic parties have also called on their members to study.

    全国干部学习斯大林著作和联共代表大会文件
    【本报讯】对于斯大林同志伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和联共第十九次代表大会文件的学习，已在全国各地展开，并在广大干部中间形成了热潮。
    当联共第十九次代表大会文件和斯大林同志著作的译文在中国先后发表后，中国共产党中央即在十月和十一月分别发出指示，号召全党党员和干部以极大的努力来学习。中共中央在第一个指示中指出：“苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的召开，具有极大的国际意义和历史意义。斯大林同志在大会上的演说和大会中的各项报告和文件，极深刻而正确地分析了目前的世界形势，阐明了苏联从社会主义进入共产主义的具体道路，并为全世界劳动人民争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争指出了明确的方向。我们全党干部都应以极大注意力认真学习斯大林的演说和大会主要文件，并领导和组织在国家机关、企业、学校中的非党工作人员来一起学习。”中共中央又指出学习的主要目的，是使干部了解世界形势，了解苏联的发展情况，懂得苏联的共产主义建设对保卫世界和平的意义；使干部更好地学习苏联在各方面的先进经验，并根据苏联共产党的经验改进自己的工作，加强对于马克思列宁主义的钻研。在号召全党学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”的指示中，中共中央着重指出“这一著作对于马克思主义是一重要发展”，并且“对于我国即将开始的大规模经济建设有巨大指导意义”。中共中央要求党的高级干部首先认真学习这一著作，以便指导一般党员和非党人员的学习。中共中央责成各级领导干部亲自负责动员、布置和领导这个学习，规定学习计划，指示学习要点，检查学习状况，解答学习疑难，并领导有准备的和联系实际的讨论。
    各级党的领导机关和广大干部都以极大热情响应中央的号召。党中央各机关和中央人民政府各部门的领导机关，各中央局和省市党委，都分别发出了关于学习的具体指示，并由各级党组织的负责人召集干部会议，报告关于学习的重大意义。参加学习的干部人数，据不完全统计，北京有七万六千人，东北区有十三万六千余人，中南区有十六万三千余人。参加学习的高级干部人数，北京有两千多人，东北有两千人，华北有八百人，中南有一千四百余人。
    大多数党组织已决定用四个月或更多的时间来学习斯大林同志的著作和马林科夫同志的报告，先求得对文件本身的熟读和充分了解，然后再作进一步的深入研究。在我国目前的条件下，为了保证学习的时间，许多单位都规定每星期两个下午中各三个小时为学习时间。这个办法在目前工作条件下已证明对学习有重要的作用。
    在这个学习中，许多主要领导干部都能认真领导。过去高级干部学习缺乏经常性的情况已开始有了显著的改变。全党干部都感到必须认真研究联共第十九次代表大会文件和斯大林同志伟大著作，才能迎接即将到来的中国的伟大经济建设任务。党中央在十二月初检查北京的二十多个单位高级干部理论学习情况的结果显示：各单位的学习都是在主要负责干部的领导下进行的。各中央局及省市委的主要负责干部也都成为这一学习的主要领导者。
    为了帮助广大干部和群众加深对斯大林同志著作和联共第十九次代表大会文件的理解，北京各机关请苏联教授作了一系列的讲演。各地负责同志已向干部和群众作了很多次的讲演和报告。东北局副书记林枫、张秀山和张明远作了系统的学习报告，西南局宣传部长张子意、华南分局第五书记方方、吉林省委副书记富振声、黑龙江省委宣传部长李剑白、山西省委副书记陶鲁笳、西康省委李亚群都给干部讲课。成都市委还组织了五十个同志作更广泛的传达。山东分局宣传部、上海市委宣传部、华东一级机关党委宣传部利用广播电台举办多次的讲座，请负责干部讲课并解答学习问题。安徽省人民广播电台也举办了讲演。中南人民广播电台重播了武汉市委学习动员报告的录音。各地各种座谈会和讨论会都在广泛地进行着。据吉林省委直属机关七十四个支部的统计，已经开了大组讨论会三百七十次，小组讨论会不下七百余次。
    由于学习的普遍展开，斯大林同志的著作和联共第十九次代表大会文件已在全国广泛地发行。据十一月底的不完全统计，斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”已发行九十六万册，斯大林在联共第十九次代表大会的演说已发行五十八万册，马林科夫的报告已发行九十九万册。马林科夫报告的蒙文译本已在归绥的蒙文报纸上发表。关于联共第十九次代表大会的文献，除原联共中央政治局委员的所有报告和发言已在人民日报和全国各地报纸发表外，其他已译出发表的还有：苏联共产党党章，萨布罗夫关于苏联第五个五年计划指示的报告，关于第五个五年计划的指示，苏斯洛夫的发言，米哈依洛夫的发言，库兹涅佐夫的发言，法捷耶夫的发言，伊里切夫的发言。
    各地主要报纸普遍地转载了人民日报号召学习斯大林同志著作和联共第十九次代表大会文件的社论。学习杂志发表社论号召进行这一学习要联系实际工作。十一月十日出版的文艺报向全国文艺工作者提出认真学习斯大林著作的任务。许多其它的重要的期刊和报纸，例如中国青年、世界知识、新建设、光明日报、东北日报、群众日报、上海大公报、文汇报刊载了许多帮助学习的资料、注释、笔记和学习论文。人民日报、工人日报和学习译丛刊载了许多篇从苏联真理报、劳动报和哲学问题杂志翻译的帮助学习斯大林著作的论文。
    参加到这一学习热潮里来的，不只有党政干部、教员和学生，而且还有中国人民解放军的干部和正在进行着抗美援朝紧张战斗的中国人民志愿军的干部。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在十一月号召并组织各界民主人士参加学习。中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、九三学社等民主党派也都号召它们的成员进行学习。
