    Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, Guangdong Province, have improved their farming techniques, resulting in a general bumper harvest of crops. Although some areas of the autonomous region suffered from wind, water, and insect pests this year, the total output of major grains (rice) in the region still increased by an average of 10% compared with last year, and the output of miscellaneous grains (sweet potatoes, corn, beans, etc.) increased by 20% compared with last year.
    In the past, farmers in the five counties of Baisha, Ledong, etc., under the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, generally lacked cattle and farm implements, and agricultural production technology was backward. The Li and Miao farmers in the mountainous areas used the "slash-and-burn" cultivation method or only cultivated with simple wooden plows. In the plains, general cultivation was extensive, and there was no habit of accumulating fertilizer, applying fertilizer, or cultivating and weeding. Therefore, the yield per unit area was very low, with an average yield of only about 150 to 200 catties of rice per mu of paddy field. Now, the People's Government is vigorously supporting and leading the Li and Miao farmers to restore and develop agricultural production. This summer, the Central South Military and Political Committee issued agricultural production loans of 5.5 billion yuan to minority areas of Hainan to help minority farmers overcome the difficulties of lacking cattle and farm implements. The Hainan Administrative Office has trained a large number of agricultural and water conservancy technicians and assigned them to work in the autonomous region. They cooperated with cadres of the people's governments at all levels in the autonomous region to go deep into the rural areas, widely publicize the policies of developing agricultural production and advanced farming methods, and provide specific guidance to farmers in the fields. At the same time, under the promotion of the patriotic production increase competition movement in the entire autonomous region, the vast number of Li and Miao farmers began to carry out deep plowing and intensive cultivation. Li and Miao farmers in various places generally used cattle for plowing and cultivating and weeding, and carried out seed selection. In Ledong County alone, more than 1,400 Li women learned how to plow the fields. The autonomous region also launched a fertilizer accumulation and production campaign in conjunction with the patriotic health movement, and built a large number of cattle sheds, toilets, and manure pits. In the second half of this year alone, Ledong County built more than 9,600 cattle sheds, accumulated more than 744,000 dan of fertilizer, and applied 360,000 dan of fertilizer. The 340 high-yield households in the county applied an average of 20 dan of fertilizer per mu of land. This year, the counties in the autonomous region also mobilized the masses to build more than 2,000 small-scale water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigation area by more than 40,000 mu. Due to the preliminary improvement of farming techniques, the yield per unit area of ​​fields in the autonomous region has increased this year. The autumn crops in Shiling Township, Baoting County, increased by 30% compared with last year. Huang Jinwen, a Li farmer of Shiling Village, a high-yield household in the township, harvested a total of 1,340 catties of rice this year from his 2.3 mu of land, doubling the output compared with last year.

    广东省海南黎族、苗族自治区农作物丰收
    广东省海南黎族、苗族自治区各族农民改进耕作技术，使农作物普遍获得丰收。今年该自治区部分地区虽受风、水、虫等灾害，但全区主要粮食（稻谷）仍比去年平均增产百分之十，杂粮（蕃薯、玉米、豆类等）比去年增产百分之二十。
    以前，海南黎族、苗族自治区所属白沙、乐东等五个县的农民，普遍缺少耕牛、农具，农业生产技术落后，山区的黎、苗族农民，用“刀耕火种”的耕作方式，或只以简单的木黎耕作；平原地区，一般耕作粗放，也没有积肥、施肥、中耕除草的习惯。因此单位面积产量很低，每亩稻田平均只收稻谷一百五十斤至二百斤左右。现在，人民政府大力扶助和领导黎、苗族农民恢复发展农业生产。今夏中南军政委员会发放海南少数民族地区的农业生产贷款即达五十五亿元，帮助少数民族农民克服缺乏耕牛、农具的困难。海南行政公署曾培养大批农业、水利的技术人员，分配到该自治区工作。配合自治区各级人民政府的干部，深入农村，广泛宣传发展农业生产的政策和先进的耕作方法，并到田地里具体指导农民生产。同时在全自治区爱国丰产竞赛运动的推动下，黎、苗族广大农民，开始进行深耕细作。各地黎、苗族农民普遍使用耕牛，和中耕除草，并进行了选种。乐东县就有一千四百多个黎族妇女学会了犁田。自治区还结合着爱国卫生运动开展了积肥造肥运动，大量建造牛舍、厕所、粪坑。今年下半年，仅乐东县就建盖牛舍九千六百多间，积肥七十四万四千多市担，施肥三十六万市担，该县三百四十个丰产户，每亩田平均下肥二十市担。自治区各县今年还发动群众兴建小型水利二千多处，扩大了灌溉面积四万多亩。由于耕作技术的初步改进，今年自治区田地的单位面积产量已有提高。保亭县什玲乡秋季作物比去年增产了百分之三十。该乡什玲村丰产户黎族农民黄金文的二亩三分田，今年共收一千三百四十斤稻谷，比去年的产量增加了一倍。　（新华社）
