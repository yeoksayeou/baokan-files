Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 21st: As the Japanese economic crisis deepens, with the bourgeoisie passing on their losses through layoffs and a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises closing down, the number of unemployed workers is constantly increasing.

According to the Yoshida government's Labor Ministry's extremely incomplete so-called "enterprise restructuring statistics," in the year from September 1951 to August 1952, 3,506 factories laid off more than 198,000 workers, accounting for more than 10 percent of the original total number of workers in these factories. This statistic is clearly greatly understated. According to the Labor Ministry's survey, more than 673,000 workers applied for unemployment insurance benefits in the ten months from September 1951 to July 1952 alone, and this figure does not include a large number of unemployed workers who did not apply for unemployment insurance benefits. The contradiction in the Labor Ministry's survey statistics exposes the Yoshida government's clumsy attempt to conceal the increasingly serious unemployment situation.

Japanese official materials also reflect that the crisis in industrial sectors closely related to export trade is particularly serious. This is the inevitable result of the shrinking capitalist market and the United States' control of Japanese trade. According to the "enterprise restructuring statistics," the textile industry and the metal industry (including the steel industry, machinery manufacturing, etc.) laid off the most workers in the above-mentioned year. The former had 674 factories laying off a total of more than 52,000 people, and the latter had 961 factories laying off nearly 45,000 people. Many enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, have been unable to escape the crisis by means of layoffs and can only declare bankruptcy. According to statistics, as many as 9,000 companies went bankrupt from January to August this year alone.

### 日本经济危机深刻化  失业人数增加中小企业纷纷倒闭

    日本经济危机深刻化
    失业人数增加中小企业纷纷倒闭
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：在日本经济危机深刻化的过程中，随着资产阶级以解雇的手段转嫁他们的损失和大批中小企业的倒闭，失业工人的数量在不断的增加。
    根据吉田政府劳动省的极不完全的所谓“企业整理统计”，在一九五一年九月到一九五二年八月这一年中间，有三千五百零六家工厂解雇了十九万八千多名工人，占这些工厂原有的工人总数的百分之十以上。这个统计数字显然是被大大缩小了的。同样根据劳动省的调查，仅在一九五一年九月到一九五二年七月这十一个月期间，申请领取失业保险金的工人即达六十七万三千多人，而这个数字还没有包括未曾申请失业保险金的大批失业工人在内。劳动省调查统计材料的矛盾，暴露出吉田政府拙劣地企图隐瞒愈来愈严重的失业情况。
    日本官方的材料也反映出与出口贸易关系密切的产业部门危机特别严重，这是资本主义市场缩小和美国控制日本贸易的必然后果。据“企业整理统计”，在上述一年中，解雇最多的是纺织业和五金业（包括钢铁业、机器制造业等）。前者有六百七十四家工厂共解雇五万二千多人，后者有九百六十一家工厂共解雇将近四万五千人。许多企业，特别是中小企业已经无法利用解雇的手段来逃避危机，而只能宣告倒闭。据统计，仅在今年一月到八月，破产的公司就达九千家。
