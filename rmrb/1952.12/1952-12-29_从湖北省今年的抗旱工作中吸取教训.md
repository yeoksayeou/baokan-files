Learn Lessons from Hubei Province's Drought Resistance Work This Year
Zhang Zilin, Director of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government

In the mass drought prevention and resistance movement vigorously carried out across the country in 1952, the Xiaogan and Huanggang Special Districts and parts of the Jingzhou and Xiangyang Special Districts of Hubei Province suffered from a drought unprecedented in the past 30 years. The area of heavily and lightly affected areas in the province accounted for 18 percent of the total cultivated land, and the estimated reduction in grain production was about 2.2 billion catties.

Since mid-May of this year, Hubei Province began to experience drought; by June, during the vigorous growth season of rice, the drought became more severe, and the affected area continued to expand. At that time, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government listed drought resistance as the overriding central task, and urgently mobilized the masses to fight against drought. Thus, an unprecedentedly large-scale mass drought resistance movement was launched. More than 50 percent of the labor force in Suixian and Yingshan counties, which were severely affected by the drought, were mobilized to participate in the drought resistance struggle, and an average of 120,000 people were dispatched to fight against drought in Macheng County every day. In this movement, experienced farmers were relied upon, and many water sources were developed. Many counties built temporary canals, temporary dams, and dug temporary wells. Many deeds of transporting water over mountains and ridges occurred. According to incomplete statistics from 38 counties in the province: More than 3.36 million people participated in the drought resistance effort, mobilizing more than 120,000 waterwheels; more than 110,000 ponds, dams, wells, and culverts were built, rescuing more than 11 million mu of land, and preserving about 30 percent of the harvest in severely affected areas.

This year, the leadership in Hubei Province has paid considerable attention to the drought resistance work, and the mobilization of forces for drought resistance has also been significant. But why did a considerable part of Hubei Province still suffer from severe drought? What lessons should we learn from this incident?

First of all, we can see that due to the high importance attached to production by the Party and the People's Government in the past three years, and due to the efforts of the broad masses of farmers to produce and their tenacious struggle against natural disasters after liberation, especially after land reform, the scenes of drought disasters in dozens of provinces and hundreds of counties across the country, as in 1929, 1930, and 1934, are gone forever. However, on the other hand, because the country's economic construction has just crossed the recovery stage, neither areas with relatively superior water conservancy conditions in the past, nor the arid northern regions and the hilly mountainous areas in the south, have the full capacity to prevent drought disasters; in addition, the soil structure in various parts of the country has been damaged for a long time, and the soil's water storage capacity is very weak, resulting in frequent droughts in provinces in the Yangtze River basin. Under such circumstances, all localities should, in accordance with the decision on drought prevention and resistance issued by the Government Administration Council in February 1952, treat drought prevention as a major task in long-term production and construction. In addition to actively mobilizing the masses to develop the habit of preventing drought every year, they should also prepare to carry out basic agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy construction in a planned manner in order to prevent disasters caused by drought. This is because temporary, rush-based drought resistance work is only a remedy when drought prevention work is not done well, and it should not be regarded as a regular major measure. Of course, before the prevention work is fully carried out, once a drought occurs, it is still very important to do a good job in drought resistance in a timely and diligent manner to minimize the disaster. After suffering from drought this year, the leadership in Hubei Province has made great determination, and starting from this winter, it has begun to vigorously launch a farmland water conservancy construction movement in the disaster-stricken areas in a planned and step-by-step manner, and is preparing to basically eliminate the threat of drought in the next five or six years. Hubei Province has promptly learned its lessons after suffering from drought this year, and has begun to carry out water conservancy basic construction in a planned and targeted manner. This approach is very good. All localities should try their best to change the past leadership methods that did not prepare in peacetime and relied solely on temporary rushes, under the principle of "prevention is more important than resistance."

Secondly, judging from the severity of the disaster in the drought-stricken areas of Hubei Province this year, there are significant differences in various regions. In hilly areas with a shortage of water sources, which are prone to drought in normal times, the drought this year was even more severe, with only 20 to 30 percent of the harvest on average; mountainous areas with better water sources and later production seasons, mostly suffering from drought before transplanting seedlings, these areas have an average harvest of 40 to 50 percent; the plains along the river, due to the convenience of water sources, after vigorous rescue, can generally achieve a situation where there is drought but no disaster. This phenomenon illustrates one problem, that is, whether the water source is abundant determines the success or failure of drought resistance work. The Government Administration Council's December 19th instruction on continuing to carry out drought prevention and resistance emphasizes that all localities should widely launch a water storage movement in the 1953 drought prevention and resistance work, and at the same time, strictly manage existing water conservancy facilities, cherish water, and use water economically and rationally, so as to give full play to the irrigation effectiveness of water conservancy facilities. This is very important.

In drought prevention and resistance work, the current problems in the South are still the poor quality of pond and dam projects and the weak capacity for water storage and drought resistance; in the North, although waterwheels and wells have developed greatly, they are also unable to function effectively due to poor quality and insufficient water sources. In the water storage movement carried out in various places in the future, a certain amount of effort should be devoted to repairing and improving the quality of these existing irrigation facilities so that they can play their full role. In order to completely solve the water source problem in hilly and mountainous areas, Central South, after detailed investigation, decided to universally launch a mass movement to build small reservoirs in the entire region in 1953, in order to store water in mountain streams and irrigate along the mountains. This type of reservoir has a history of two or three hundred years in Hunan, and is well known to the broad masses of farmers. It is a good method that is both reliable and feasible for solving the problem of water source shortage. The hilly areas in the South can do this. Although the natural conditions in the North are relatively poor, it is still possible to pilot and promote the construction of ponds and small reservoirs and other water storage measures in areas where conditions permit.

In addition, large-scale irrigation projects play a significant role in solving the problem of drought in larger areas and increasing production per unit area. The masses in various places have an urgent need for this. In the past three years, a total of 358 large-scale projects have been restored and newly built across the country. Together with the old irrigation areas such as the Dujiangyan and Tongjiyan in Sichuan, the Tanglai Canal and Huinong Canal in Ningxia, the Yellow River Sui West Irrigation Area, the Guangji Canal in the former Pingyuan Province, and the ten canals in Shaanxi, there are a total of 724 irrigation areas, of which about 26 million mu of irrigation areas have an area of more than 100,000 mu. The newly built ones are mostly modern projects, which are China's valuable wealth. However, the water use situation in most irrigation areas is not satisfactory, and the irrigation efficiency has not been fully utilized. Ideologically, leaders at all levels still tend to do more new projects and large projects, and have not strictly managed existing irrigation facilities, failed to irrigate the river water to the fields in a timely and rational manner, and expand the area that can be irrigated. This is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Therefore, basic construction projects should be carried out steadily and step by step in the future, and avoid being greedy for large scale, quantity, and speed, so as to avoid waste.

As for the important measures for drought prevention, in addition to building water conservancy, the basic and effective methods of creating shelter forests and implementing grass-crop rotation should also be carried out annually at the same time. In this way, it can fundamentally guarantee that we will not be threatened by drought.

    从湖北省今年的抗旱工作中吸取教训
    中央人民政府水利部农田水利局局长　张子林
    在一九五二年全国各地大力开展的群众性防旱抗旱运动中，湖北省的孝感、黄冈专区和荆州、襄阳专区的一部分地区发生了三十年来所未有的旱灾。全省轻重灾区面积占全部耕地百分之十八，减产粮食估计约有二十余亿斤。
    自今年五月中旬起，湖北省即开始干旱；到六月水稻盛长季节，干旱更形严重，受旱面积也日益扩大。当时中共湖北省委和省人民政府即把抗旱工作列为压倒一切的中心任务，紧急动员群众进行抗旱，这样，一个规模空前浩大的群众性抗旱运动就展开起来。旱象严重的随县、应山等县都动员了百分之五十以上的人力投入抗旱斗争，麻城县每日平均也有十二万人出动抗旱。在这次运动中依靠了有经验的农民，开辟了许多水源，有很多县份开临时渠，筑临时坝，掘临时井，水翻山，水过岗的事迹很多。根据全省三十八县不完全统计：参加抗旱的群众达三百三十六万人，动员水车十二万余辆；修筑塘坝、挖井、开剅闸等共十一万余处，约抢救出一千一百多万亩，使重灾地区保住了三成左右的收成。
    今年湖北省领导方面对抗旱工作不算不重视，动员抗旱的力量也不算不大，但是为什么湖北省仍有相当大的一部分地区遭受了严重的旱灾呢？我们从这件事情中应该得到那些教训呢？
    首先我们可以看出，三年来由于党和人民政府对生产事业的高度重视，由于广大农民在解放后，特别是在土地改革后，努力生产，积极向自然灾害进行的顽强的斗争，像一九二九、一九三○年和一九三四年那样全国十数省六七百县干旱成灾的景象是一去不复返了。但另一方面，由于国家的经济建设刚刚跨过恢复阶段，无论是过去水利条件较为优越地区，或是一向干旱的北方地区和南方的丘陵山地，都还没有完全防止旱灾的力量；加以全国各地的土壤结构过去长期遭到破坏，土壤的蓄水能力很弱，以致在长江流域各省旱灾仍然经常发生。在这种情况下，各地只有按照一九五二年二月政务院关于防旱抗旱决定中指出的把防旱作为长期生产建设事业中的主要工作，除积极动员群众养成年年防旱的习惯外，并准备有计划地进行农业、林业及水利的基本建设，才能防止干旱带来的灾害。这是因为临时的突击性的抗旱工作，仅是在防旱工作未做好的情况下的补救工作，而不能把它看作一件经常的主要的措施，当然在预防工作未全面做好之先，一旦旱象发生，及时地努力地做好抗旱工作，以尽量减轻灾情，仍是非常重要的。今年湖北省在遭受旱灾后，领导方面已经下了很大决心，并自今冬起开始有计划有步骤地在受灾地区大力开展兴修农田水利运动，并准备在今后五六年内做到基本消除旱灾的威胁。湖北省在今年遭受旱灾后，及时接受教训，开始有计划地有目标地进行水利基本建设，这种做法是很好的。各地应该尽力在“防重于抗”的方针下，改变过去平时不准备单纯依靠临时突击的领导方法。
    其次，从湖北省今年受旱地区的灾情程度上看，各个地区有很大不同。在丘陵水源缺乏的地区，平时就易受旱，今年受旱更加厉害，一般只有二三成收成；一般山区水源较好，生产季节又较迟，多是未插秧先受旱，这些地区平均均收四、五成；滨河平畈地区，由于水源方便，经过大力抢救，一般可以达到有旱不为灾。这种现象说明了一个问题，就是水源充沛与否决定着抗旱工作的成败。政务院十二月十九日通过的继续开展防旱抗旱指示中着重指出了各地应该在一九五三年的防旱抗旱工作中广泛地开展一个蓄水运动，同时对于现有水利设施实行严格管理，珍惜水量，经济合理用水，以发挥水利设施的灌溉效能。这是十分重要的。
    在防旱抗旱工作中，南方目前存在的问题，仍是塘坝工程质量差，蓄水抗旱能力薄弱；在北方水车水井虽然已有很大的发展，但也因质量不高，水源不足，还有很多的井不能发生作用。今后在各地开展的蓄水运动中，对这些已有的灌溉设施，应拿出一定力量进行补修并提高工程质量，使其充分发挥作用。中南为了彻底解决丘陵山岳地区的水源问题，经过详细调查，决定一九五三年在全区普遍开展一个群众性的兴修小型水库运动，以在山溪蓄水沿山浇灌。这种水库在湖南已有二三百年的历史，早为广大农民所熟知，是解决水源缺乏而又确切可行的一个好办法；南方丘陵地带可以这样做，北方虽然自然条件较差，但在有条件地区，仍可试行推广兴建池塘和小水库以及其他蓄水措施。
    另外，大型灌溉工程在解决较大面积的干旱问题，及单位面积的增产上，有着很大的作用，各地群众对此都有迫切要求。三年来，全国恢复与新建大型工程共有三百五十八处，连旧有灌区像四川的都江堰、通济堰，宁夏的唐徕渠、惠农渠，黄河绥西灌区，前平原省的广济渠以及陕西十一条渠道等，共有七百二十四个灌区，其中十万亩以上面积的灌区共约有二千六百万亩。新建的多数是现代化的工程，这是我国宝贵的财富。但是，多数灌区的用水情况是不能令人满意的，灌溉效能普遍没有充分发挥，各级领导思想上，还是偏于多做新工程，做大工程，而对于现有灌溉设施没有进行严格管理，未能及时地和合理地将河水灌溉到田地上，和扩大能够浇到的面积。这是亟待解决的问题。因此，今后应按步就班地稳步进行基本建设工程，切忌贪大、贪多、贪快，以避免浪费。
    至于防旱的重要措施，除兴办水利外，还有营造防护林，实行草田轮作等基本有效办法，也应同时逐年地进行。这样就可以根本保证不受干旱的威胁了。
