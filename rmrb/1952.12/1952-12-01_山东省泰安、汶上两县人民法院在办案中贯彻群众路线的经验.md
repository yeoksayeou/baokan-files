The People's Courts of Tai'an and Wenshang counties in Shandong Province, based on the instructions of higher authorities regarding judicial reform, and on the basis of internal study and inspection, under the unified leadership of the Party and government organs at the same level and the coordination of relevant departments, have achieved considerable success and initially created some experiences in the past half-month by re-examining wrongly judged cases, handling cadres who were seriously corrupt and perverted the law, clearing up backlog cases, and mobilizing the masses to participate in handling cases and inspecting judicial work.

When mobilizing the masses to carry out judicial reform work, the two county People's Courts first organized judicial reform work teams and selected key districts. Then, they took all the cases in that district down to the grassroots level and worked with the district and township governments and people's organizations to study the local backlog of cases and the most pressing demands of the masses. They then drew up a plan, starting with the cases that the masses most urgently wanted to resolve. All cases in the county, district, township, and village were handled in a unified manner, with the broad participation of the masses, simplified procedures, and on-the-spot solutions. In terms of specific methods, they first convened meetings of village cadres, mediation committee members, mass representatives, and activists to conduct propaganda and education on judicial reform, introduce the cases, and explain the policies. Then, they convened meetings of all parties involved and used collective mediation to conduct collective education and handle the cases separately. The Tai'an County People's Court handled 266 civil and criminal cases in ten days, of which 219 were reconciled and 47 were adjudicated. The Wenshang County People's Court handled 75 civil and criminal cases in two days, of which 64 were reconciled and 11 were adjudicated. Through the handling of these cases, not only were the masses educated, and the cadres improved, and various tasks promoted, but also the relationship between the People's Court and the people was strengthened. The masses reflected: the People's Court is now completely different from the past; they come to our doorsteps to do things for us, they don't put on airs, they practice democracy, and they handle problems quickly. In the Kuomintang times, running to the city to file a lawsuit would cost dozens of silver dollars. Now everyone is a judge, and the woods are the courtroom. We don't have to travel, and no good person is wronged. This method is really good! Village cadres also reflected: in the past, we were not bold in handling problems, and we didn't know how to do it. Now we have found the key, and we have the capital to deal with problems in the future.

The judicial reform work teams were welcomed everywhere. Many areas invited the work teams to go to their areas, and the areas that had already been dealt with warmly asked them to stay. The judicial cadres were greatly encouraged. Everyone felt that the mass line really solves problems, eliminates ideological obstacles to absorbing the masses to participate in handling cases, creates experience in absorbing the masses to participate in handling cases, and enhances confidence in correctly handling cases in the future.

The work of the two counties during this period powerfully demonstrates that relying on the masses, trusting the masses, and absorbing the broad masses to participate in handling cases is the only correct line for the People's Courts to handle all cases. Only in this way can we promptly and effectively suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and consolidate our victory. Only in this way can we quickly and correctly mediate internal disputes among the people and strengthen internal unity among the people. According to the work experience of the two counties, to do a good job of mass participation in handling cases, the following points must be noted:

1.  We must establish the mass viewpoint of the people's judicial work and believe that the masses can completely solve the problems of the masses. The people's judicial work must be based on the active participation of the broad masses of the people in order to complete its tasks and play its role; otherwise, it will accomplish nothing. Any erroneous ideas such as "the masses are all talking at once, and the problem is even more difficult to deal with" and "afraid of losing the dignity of the court" must be eliminated. The reason why the cadres of the People's Courts of the two counties were able to go deep into the masses to handle all cases was mainly because, through judicial reform studies, they drew a clear line between the new and old judicial work and thoroughly criticized the "mystification," "specialization," "purely technical viewpoint," and purely "sitting in court to hear cases" and other old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles in the trial work of the People's Courts.

2.  We must pay attention to organizing, relying on organization, and giving play to the role of organization. In particular, district and township governments and mass organizations should be regarded as bridges and strong assistants for the People's Courts to solve cases and absorb the broad masses to participate in judicial activities. Because they have close ties with the masses, they are most familiar with the situation among the masses, and the masses have a high degree of faith in them. Through organizing and relying on organization, we can not only strengthen leadership, comprehensively understand the situation, grasp the pressing demands of the broad masses, and enable the cases to be handled correctly, but also educate the masses more widely through the handling of cases, combine and promote various tasks. For example, the Wenshang County People's Court, in conjunction with the Communist Youth League, handled a case of a Youth League member mistreating a woman, and educated all the Youth League members in the district. The Tai'an County People's Court, in cooperation with the People's Armed Forces Department, handled a case of a landlord restoration, educated all the militiamen in the district, reorganized the public security and defense committee, and strengthened the control of unlawful landlords; in coordination with the Women's Federation, it handled a case of interference in women's marriage, and universally conducted education on the Marriage Law among the masses, and enhanced women's confidence in the struggle against the old marriage system.

3.  The People's Court must first understand the overall situation of the local area before handling each case, and then start with the cases that the masses most urgently need to solve, and select the typical cases among them for solution first. This can not only educate the masses more realistically and vividly, and improve the masses' policy level and awareness, so that the problems that have been brought to the court can be quickly resolved, but also prevent the occurrence of similar problems.

The Tai'an County Judicial Reform Work Team, in the tenth district, based on the demands of the broad masses, first tried and handled the counter-revolutionary landlord Jiang Shusen, who did not accept control during the period of control, carried out restoration and counter-settlement activities, and was dissatisfied by the broad masses, and the controlled counter-revolutionary element Wang Qinglin, who interfered with his daughter's freedom of marriage and was resented by the masses. The masses' morale was boosted, and their enthusiasm for production was also improved, and the other eighty-four cases were also quickly handled with the active assistance of the broad masses. In particular, through the handling of the typical case of Wang Qinglin interfering with his daughter's freedom of marriage, the Marriage Law was further implemented. Not only was Wang Qinglin's daughter's freedom of marriage guaranteed, and the struggle of the broad masses of young men and women against the feudal marriage system was encouraged and supported, but it also immediately influenced seven old women who abused their daughters-in-law to make self-criticisms, guaranteeing that they would never abuse them again. Wang Tongsheng and Zhang Zhendao voluntarily sent two child brides back to their mothers' homes, and Shi Jiamo, who married before reaching the marriageable age, also voluntarily sent the woman back to her mothers' home, saying: "I will come back after I am old enough."

4.  Explaining policies, establishing standards, and promoting democracy are important methods for absorbing the broad masses to participate in handling cases. The masses in Tai'an and Wenshang said: everyone is a judge, no one dares to talk nonsense, and no one dares to favor one side, which is clear evidence. To absorb the masses to participate in judicial activities, we must first conduct in-depth policy education for the masses, and on the basis of improving the masses' policy level and class consciousness, let the masses widely express their opinions according to policy standards and actual conditions. In this way, we can not only gather the wisdom of the masses, clarify right and wrong, and quickly and correctly handle problems, but also raise the masses' understanding to the policy level through the handling of each specific problem.

5.  The People's Court must pay attention to seeking truth from facts and simplifying procedures when handling each case. It is a corrupt and old judicial work style to use stereotyped judgments to draw conclusions on everything, regardless of the size of the matter or the severity of the case. People's judicial workers must first study the nature, the root cause, and the size of the case of each case they accept to determine their handling method. Cases that can be mediated must be mediated to eliminate estrangement and enhance the unity of the people; cases that need to be tried in public must be tried in public; procedures that need to be handled should be handled; and those that do not need to be handled should be resolutely abolished. Tai'an and Wenshang have provided a lot of experience in this regard. For example, small fights and quarrels are handled by means of mass mediation and mutual self-criticism and apology. Those who have made major mistakes are self-criticized at mass meetings or criticized in public. Those who seriously violate national policies and laws are tried in public and dealt with severely. Some minor cases can be exempted from all procedures with the consent of both parties; some can be issued a certificate by the township or district government or the mediators who participated in the handling of the problem; and larger cases should be given a certificate or formal judgment by the court. In this way, the handling of many problems can be prevented from being delayed and backlogged due to complicated procedures. This method is extremely supported by the masses.

    山东省泰安、汶上两县人民法院在办案中贯彻群众路线的经验
    山东省人民法院副院长　苏羽
    泰安、汶上两县人民法院，根据上级关于司法改革工作的指示，在内部学习检查的基础上，在同级党、政机关的统一领导与有关部门的配合下，通过对错判案件的改判、严重贪赃枉法干部的处理和积案的清理，发动群众参加办案与对司法工作的检查，半月来已取得不少成绩，并初步创造了一些经验。
    两县人民法院在发动群众进行司法改革工作时，首先组织司法改革工作组，选择了重点区，然后携带该区所有案件下去，与区、乡政权和各人民团体共同研究了当地积案情况与群众目前最迫切的要求，订出计划，从群众最迫切要求解决的案件入手。县、区、乡、村所有案件统一处理，广泛吸收群众参加，简化手续，就地解决。在具体方法上，首先召集乡村干部、调解委员、群众代表与积极分子会议，进行司法改革的宣传教育，介绍案情，讲明政策；然后召集所有当事人会议，以集体调处方式，进行集体教育，分别处理。泰安县人民法院十天处理了二六六起民、刑案件，其中和解的二一九起，判决的四七起。汶上县人民法院两天共处理了民、刑案件七五件，其中和解的六四件，判决的十一件。通过这批案件的处理，不仅教育了群众，提高了干部，推进了各种工作，而且密切了人民法院与人民群众的关系。群众反映：现在人民法院和过去完全不同了，到家门上来给咱们办事，不摆架子，实行民主，处理问题又快。国民党时候打官司向城里跑一趟，就花好几十元银元，现在大家当法官，树林当大堂，既不跑路，又冤枉不了一个好人，这法子真好！乡村干部也反映：过去处理问题不大胆，不知道怎么办，这一下可摸着门了，再处理问题就有了本钱。
    司法改革工作组到处受到欢迎，许多地区邀请工作组到他们那里去，已处理的地区则热情挽留。司法干部得到了很大的鼓励。大家感到群众路线真解决问题，消除了吸收群众参加办案的思想障碍，创造了吸收群众参加办案的经验，增强了今后正确处理案件的信心。
    两县这段时期的工作有力地说明了：依靠群众，相信群众，吸收广大群众参加处理案件，是人民法院处理一切案件的唯一正确路线。只有如此才能及时地有效地镇压一切反革命活动，巩固我们的胜利。只有如此才能迅速而正确地调解人民内部纠纷，增强人民内部团结。根据两县工作经验，要作好群众办案的工作，必须注意以下几点：
    一、必须树立人民司法工作的群众观点，相信群众完全可以解决群众的事情，人民司法工作必须建立在广大人民群众积极参加的基础上才能完成它的任务，发挥它的作用，否则定将一事无成。任何认为“群众七嘴八舌的，问题更不好处理”，“怕失去法庭尊严”等错误思想，必须加以肃清。两县人民法院的干部所以能深入群众处理一切案件，主要是因为通过司法改革学习，划清了新旧司法工作的界限，彻底批判了人民法院审判工作中的“神秘化”、“特殊化”、“单纯技术观点”与单纯“坐堂问案”等旧法观点与旧司法作风。
    二、必须注意通过组织，依靠组织，发挥组织的作用。特别是区、乡政权与各群众团体，应视为人民法院解决案件，吸收广大群众参加司法活动的桥梁与坚强的助手。因为它们和群众有着密切的联系，它们最熟悉群众中的情况，群众对它们有着高度的信仰。通过组织、依靠组织不仅可以增强领导，全面了解情况，掌握广大群众的迫切要求，使案件得到正确的处理，而且可以通过案件的处理，更广泛地教育群众，结合与推动各种工作。如汶上县人民法院，结合青年团处理了一个青年团员虐待妇女的案件，就教育了该区所有青年团员。泰安县人民法院结合人民武装部，处理了一个地主复辟的案子，教育了该区所有的民兵，整理了治安保卫委员会，加强了对不法地主的管制；配合妇联处理了一个干涉妇女婚姻的案件，在群众中普遍进行了婚姻法的教育，提高了妇女对旧婚姻制度斗争的信心。
    三、人民法院对每一个案件的处理，都必须先了解当地的全面情况，然后从群众最迫切需要解决的案件入手，选择其中的典型案件先加以解决。这样不仅可以更现实更生动地教育群众，提高群众的政策水平与觉悟程度，使已经提到法庭上的问题迅速得到解决，而且可以防止同类问题的发生。
    泰安县司法改革工作组在十区根据广大群众的要求，首先审判处理了在管制期间不接受管制、进行复辟倒算活动、为广大群众所不满的反动地主蒋树森和干涉女儿婚姻自由，为群众所愤恨的被管制反革命分子王清林。群众情绪振奋了，生产积极性也提高了，而且其他八十四起案件也在广大群众的积极协助下迅速得到了处理。特别是通过王清林干涉女儿婚姻自由这一典型案件的处理，进一步贯彻了婚姻法。不仅保障了王清林女儿的婚姻自由，鼓舞与支持了广大青年男女的反封建婚姻制度的斗争，而且立即影响了七个虐待儿媳的老太婆做了检讨，保证今后再不虐待。王同生、张振道两家自动把两个童养媳送还娘家，未满结婚年龄而结婚的石家模也自动将女方送回娘家，说：“等够年龄后再来。”
    四、讲明政策、树立标准、发扬民主，是吸收广大群众参加办案的重要方法。泰安、汶上的群众说：大家当法官，谁也不敢胡说，谁也不敢偏袒一方，就是明证。吸收群众参加司法活动，首先必须对群众进行深入的政策教育，在提高群众政策水平与阶级觉悟的基础上，让群众根据政策标准与实际情况，广泛地发表自己的意见。这样不仅可以集思广益，弄清是非，迅速正确地处理问题，而且通过每一具体问题的处理，可以把群众的认识提高到政策水平上来。
    五、人民法院对每一案件的处理，都必须注意实事求是，简化手续。事无大小，案无轻重，一律以八股式的判决书来作定论，这是腐朽的、旧的司法工作作风。人民司法工作者，对自己受理的每一个案件，必须首先研究它的性质、产生的根源、案情的大小来决定自己处理的方法。可以调解的案件必须进行调解，以消除隔阂，增强人民内部的团结；需要公开审判的案件，必须公开审理；需要办理手续的就应办理；不需要办理的，应坚决废除。泰安、汶上在这方面曾提供了不少的经验。如小的斗殴口角，采取群众调解，双方检讨道歉的方式来处理。犯有较大错误的，在群众大会上检讨或当众批评。对于那些严重违犯国家政策法令的，则公开审判，严肃处理。一些细小的案件，在双方同意下可以免除一切手续；有的可以由乡、区政府或参与问题处理的调解人员等写一证明；较大的则应由法院给一证件或正式的判决书。这样使许多问题的处理，可以不因手续的繁琐而拖延积压。此种办法，群众是极为拥护的。
