　　Some units in Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces exhibit departmentalism or reliance on others, which affects the preparatory work for basic construction.

　　When the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government began to rectify engineering companies and concentrate design forces, the Fuxin Municipal People's Government dismantled its affiliated engineering company and transferred the manager to other work; the Jinzhou Municipal People's Government even transferred the best engineer from the engineering company to do planning work; the Siping Municipal People's Government withdrew two vehicles from its affiliated engineering company. In order to concentrate the use of design forces, the Liaodong Provincial People's Government decided to concentrate the design personnel from the Industrial Department and other relevant departments to the design company starting in September and to carry out design work starting in October. However, many departments only consider the basic construction work of their own units and do not hand over design personnel to the design company. As a result, the design forces have not yet been concentrated. In addition, some units emphasize that they do not understand the business, have a simple reliance on others, and therefore do not actively allocate cadres to set up full-time basic construction organizations. For example, the basic construction tasks of the Liaodong Provincial Department of Agriculture next year will increase by more than five times compared to this year, but the department only has two staff members responsible for basic construction work. The leaders of the department have the idea of "relying on the contractor to take on the work and reduce their own burden," hoping that the engineering company will contract the work and they will just accept it upon completion. Therefore, they do not actively study the issue of strengthening the basic construction organization, nor do they actively carry out preparatory work. The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government Public Security Department also does not pay enough attention to the preparatory work for basic construction. The department has a construction task of 50,000 square meters next year. Although the leaders of the department admit that "basic construction work is important," they have assigned the basic construction work to two inexperienced staff members in the production section, which makes it impossible to complete the task.

　　The above-mentioned ideological styles of disregarding the overall situation, only considering one's own department, not taking action oneself, only relying on others, and paying lip service to importance while taking a perfunctory attitude towards actual work are all specific manifestations of insufficient attention to basic construction. In order to strengthen the preparation for basic construction next year, the above-mentioned units must immediately correct these erroneous ideas and practices.

### 阜新锦州等市府擅自调走设计人员  辽东省农业厅等单位不积极进行基本建设准备工作

    阜新锦州等市府擅自调走设计人员
    辽东省农业厅等单位不积极进行基本建设准备工作
    辽西辽东两省有些单位，存在着本位主义或依赖思想，影响了基本建设的准备工作。
    辽西省人民政府着手整顿工程公司和集中设计力量时，阜新市人民政府把所属工程公司拆散，调经理做其他工作；锦州市人民政府竟把工程公司最好的工程师调走做计划工作；四平市人民政府把所属工程公司的两台汽车抽走。辽东省人民政府为集中使用设计力量，曾决定从九月开始把工业厅等有关部门的设计人员集中到设计公司，从十月份开始进行设计工作。但好多部门只顾本单位的基本建设工作，不把设计人员交给设计公司。因此使设计力量到现在还没有集中起来。另外有些单位则强调自己不懂业务，有单纯依赖思想，因此不积极调配干部设立基本建设专职机构。如辽东省农业厅明年的基本建设任务比今年增加五倍多，但该厅负责做基本建设工作的只有两名科员。该厅领导上有“依赖乙方包工，减轻自己负担”的想法，希望工程公司包工，到竣工时自己一验收就行了。因此就不主动研究加强基本建设机构的问题，也不积极进行准备工作。辽西省人民政府公安厅对基本建设的准备工作，也不够重视。该厅明年有五万平方公尺面积的建筑任务，该厅领导上虽然承认“基本建设工作重要”，但却把基本建设工作交给生产科两个业务生疏的科员管理，以致无法完成任务。
    以上不顾整体，只顾本位，自己不动手，只依赖别人，以及口头重视而对实际工作采取敷衍态度等的思想作风，都是对基本建设重视不足的具体表现，为了加强明年基本建设的准备，上述各单位必须立即纠正这些错误思想和作法。
