Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Following Eisenhower's public statement about continuing and expanding the war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. aggressors' war cries have become increasingly frantic.

In his statement upon returning to the United States from Korea, Eisenhower made no secret of his intention to abandon the armistice negotiations and launch new military adventures. He said that the United States "cannot hope to use any moving words" to force the Korean and Chinese side to accept the unreasonable demand for forcibly retaining prisoners of war, and therefore, "only at a time of our own choosing" can we use "action" to achieve this goal. The Associated Press admitted that Eisenhower's statement, apart from being "a clear warning to the Chinese Communists that counter-offensive steps are being planned," "is difficult to interpret in any other way." These stupid donkeys who will never learn from their mistakes still do not know that the Chinese people will never be intimidated by their despicable "warnings," etc.

At Eisenhower's instigation, American news agencies have been filling pages with propaganda about expanding the war plan, and American generals, senators, and accomplice countries in the aggression against Korea are all eager to try. The Associated Press reported from New York on the 16th that an American general admitted that American professional soldiers are "increasingly eager to take active action" in an attempt to salvage the failure of the war of aggression. This American general admitted that the strength of the Korean and Chinese People's forces is increasing faster than that of the American army. He said, "We do not have the manpower to win such a war," therefore, "we need to use all the strength we now have" to continue the war. It's just that he, unlike other warmongering generals in the United States, does not quite agree with using the Kuomintang bandit troops, because he fears that the Kuomintang bandit troops, after participating in the war for two months, will "take their weapons and defect to the enemy."

Van Fleet, commander of the Eighth Army of the U.S. military invading Korea, also revealed in a letter to American news commentator Cy Sulzberger the U.S. aggressors' delusion of turning young people from many countries, including American youth, into cannon fodder to save the U.S. warmongers from defeat. He said, "I still hope that we can achieve a military victory in Korea in order to restore the prestige of the United States in the Far East and the world. There is no other way."

U.S. Senator Styles Bridges more specifically put forward steps to realize the conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians" and expanding the war of aggression. He demanded "using a high degree of military pressure on the Korean Communists." He advocated "using our anti-communist allies in Asia, mainly using Koreans instead of Americans in the combat area, and mobilizing Japanese, Filipinos and Chinese from Taiwan," and he also advocated "using certain new weapons, including atomic weapons" to bomb Northeast China and use naval blockade to blockade China's coast. In addition to this, the American "Newsweek" also revealed on the 17th that Eisenhower will expand espionage activities in China, strengthen sabotage activities and Kuomintang bandit pirate attacks on the Chinese mainland.

Under American pressure, Britain, the number one accomplice in the aggression against Korea, also obediently expressed its readiness to participate in new military adventures. According to the American "Washington Star" on December 11, a British government spokesman said that Britain agreed to launch a "limited offensive." To achieve this goal, the British government will be willing to send a British armored division to the Korean front.

In this wave of狂热 war cries, Eisenhower met with MacArthur on the 17th to discuss MacArthur's "plan to resolve the Korean War." Although the two men kept the content of the plan a secret, the United Press admitted that "it is generally believed that MacArthur's secret proposal is to expand the Korean War." The day before this, Eisenhower met with New Zealand Prime Minister Holland to discuss the so-called "Pacific Defense Alliance," which was obviously to realize his shameless conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians."

### 美国侵略者疯狂叫嚣继续和扩大侵朝战争

    美国侵略者疯狂叫嚣继续和扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社二十日讯】在艾森豪威尔公开表示要继续和扩大侵朝战争以后，美国侵略者的战争叫嚣越来越疯狂了。
    艾森豪威尔在他从朝鲜回到美国时发表的声明中，毫不掩饰他要放弃停战谈判，发动新的军事冒险。他说，美国“不可能希望用何等动人的言词”来迫使朝中方面接受强迫扣留战俘的无理要求，因此，“只能在我们自己选择的时机”用“行动”来达到这个目的。美联社承认，艾森豪威尔的这句话，除了说它是“对中共的一个明白的警告，告诉他们反攻步骤正在计划中”而外，“很难作任何解释”。这些打死也不会学乖的蠢驴子们竟还不晓得中国人民永远也不是他们的可耻“警告”等等所能够吓倒的。
    在艾森豪威尔示意之下，美国的通讯社盈篇累牍地向美国人民宣传扩大战争计划，美国的将军、议员以及侵略朝鲜的帮凶国家们也都跃跃欲试。美联社十六日从纽约报道说，一个美国将军承认，美国的职业军人都“越来越急于采取积极行动”，企图挽救侵略战争的失败。这个美国将军承认朝中人民部队的力量加强得比美国军队快。他说，“我们没有人力打赢这样的战争”，因此，“需要利用我们现在所有的一切力量”来继续进行战争。只是他和美国其他好战的将军们不同，不大同意使用国民党匪帮军队，因为他恐怕国民党匪帮军队在参战两月之后，就会“带着武器投向敌方”。
    侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在他给美国新闻评论员赛追克·福斯特的一封信中，也透露了美国侵略者企图把许多国家的年青人，包括美国的青年们变成炮灰来替美国好战分子挽回败局的妄想。他说，“我仍然希望我们能在朝鲜获得军事上的胜利，借以恢复美国在远东与全世界的声望。除此以外，没有其他办法。”
    美国参议员斯泰尔兹·布里奇斯更加具体地提出了实现“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋、扩大侵略战争的步骤。他要求“对朝鲜的共军使用高度的军事压力”。他主张“利用我们在亚洲的反共盟国，主要是在作战地区用朝鲜人代替美国人，并动员日本人、菲律宾人与台湾的中国人”，他还主张“使用包括原子武器在内的某些新武器”，轰炸我国东北，用海军封锁我国沿海。除此而外，美国的“新闻周刊”还在十七日透露，艾森豪威尔将要扩大在中国的特务活动，加强破坏活动和国民党匪帮对中国大陆的海盗式袭击。
    在美国的压力之下，侵朝头号帮凶英国也恭顺地表示准备参加新的军事冒险。据美国“华盛顿明星报”在十二月十一日报道，英国政府的发言人说，英国同意发动一个“有限度的攻势”。为了达到这个目的，英国政府将愿意派遣一个英国装甲师到朝鲜前线去。
    在这一片狂热的战争叫嚣声中，艾森豪威尔在十七日和麦克阿瑟进行了会谈，讨论了麦克阿瑟的
    “解决朝鲜战争的计划”。虽然他们两人对这个计划的内容都秘而不宣，但是合众社承认，“一般人认为麦克阿瑟的秘密建议就是要扩大朝鲜战争”。在这以前一天，艾森豪威尔接见了新西兰总理赫兰，讨论关于所谓“太平洋防御联盟”的问题，这显然是为了实现他的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的无耻阴谋。
