Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 13th (TASS): World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie delivered the opening address at the World People's Peace Congress.

Joliot-Curie began his speech by extending his respects to all the representatives attending the World People's Peace Congress and to the Austrian peace fighters who assisted in the preparations for the Congress. He emphasized that he was speaking on behalf of the World Peace Council, which initiated this broad World People's Peace Congress, and that the Congress welcomed all movements and organizations, all people who sincerely strive to ease international tensions.

Joliot-Curie then recounted the large-scale preparatory work carried out in various countries before the holding of the World People's Peace Congress. He said: Many meetings and gatherings have been held in various countries, attended by people with various different ideas, people who previously dared not exchange opinions on the issue of peace. He said: This preparatory work helps to eliminate obstacles such as lack of trust and understanding among the people, who, although following different paths, are all working extremely earnestly to achieve this common goal – world peace. During the preparatory work, the true meaning of the World People's Peace Congress, called for by the World Peace Council, has been explained among people of various different strata. The people of various countries are in fact the preparers of this Congress, and they have elected representatives of great breadth. No one can deny that this gathering, attended by representatives of various different countries, is truly global in nature.

Joliot-Curie then analyzed the current international situation, pointing out that while the effects of World War II have not yet been eliminated, wars are being waged in three places in the world. A dangerous arms race is underway, undermining the economies of some countries, hindering human progress, and deepening the danger of another world war. Under the pretext of ensuring security, conventions, treaties, and agreements have been concluded, which in most cases only increase the threat of war. National independence and democratic freedoms are under increasing threat. The Cold War continues with slander and rumor-mongering. Some people, in order to create an atmosphere of launching a crusade, do not hesitate to incite fanatical emotions among the people in preparation for the most terrible war.

Joliot-Curie commented on the issue of using scientific achievements for war purposes, and in this regard, he recalled the events of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He said that until now, we have had firm faith in the beneficial impact of scientific progress, but we know that if science is mastered by those criminals who make war, they will obtain weapons of even greater destructive power. This allows us to imagine the consequences of a third world war. When wars are currently being waged in several places, when peace is facing great danger, everyone must remember these terrible consequences.

Sometimes, even those who strive to defend peace in various ways do not think of these possible consequences. Otherwise, how can one explain that when danger is imminent, they sometimes engage in fruitless and confusing disputes over secondary issues or those issues that even have no direct relationship with the real issue of maintaining peace?

This dangerous situation is the result of a certain international policy, and this danger was seen by many people shortly after the end of the war. Due to a correct assessment of this situation, people took the initiative and established forces to eliminate the danger of another war. But past experiences should not be ignored. We all remember the measures taken between 1918 and 1939 to avoid World War II. The League of Nations failed, and the pacifist movement of that era (various world peace foundations) also failed to organize into a strong people's movement. We must learn lessons from these failures. The problem at that time was that they failed to convince everyone who sought peace that defending peace was directly related to themselves, that they must think about peace, and that they were able to work for this cause.

Joliot-Curie further pointed out that the weakness of these movements was due to a lack of unity; divisions among the leadership, and later even within the movements themselves, made it impossible to take effective measures.

Joliot-Curie continued, stating that the First World Congress of Supporters of Peace was convened in 1949; that congress was convened in consideration of past experiences and because of the belief that only among the broad masses of the people could true forces for peace be found, because they had suffered the pain of war, and war could not be waged unless they agreed. After that congress, peace movements were launched in most countries, and the World Peace Council was also established.

Joliot-Curie then recounted the various activities of the powerful peace movement thus established. He urged everyone to pay attention to the Stockholm Appeal, which called for the unconditional prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the establishment of strict international controls to supervise the implementation of this resolution, and the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. He said that all these extensive activities of the peace movement have enabled a large portion of public opinion to express its will. It is by no means an exaggeration to say that this powerful force for peace has had a strong positive influence on the development of international politics.

Those who advocate that peace must be maintained by strength attempt to slander the activities of peace fighters with false propaganda. Even though they have attempted to create this atmosphere of distrust around us in the past and present, we continue to carry out our work persistently, and we firmly believe that we can convince people of our sincerity.

Today, it is completely clear that this great mass movement, which the peace movement has vigorously promoted, is an objective reality, and no propaganda or any effort to divide this movement can harm it.

Joliot-Curie then spoke in detail about the tasks of the peace movement and methods for further developing it. He said that the peace movement does not say that it alone represents the interests of peace; nor does it want to monopolize this activity in the future. It merely actively helps maintain peace with all its strength.

Everyone attending this Congress knows that if public opinion can perceive its strength, it can easily provide reasonable compromise solutions to the various problems that currently divide countries and put these solutions into practice. Great achievements have been made in this regard, and the World People's Peace Congress now being held proves this.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that the people attending this Congress come from extremely different countries and have extremely different philosophical, religious, political, and social viewpoints. What unites these people is the understanding that the joint action of all forces for peace must be considered, and that together, it is possible to discover and determine how to take these actions. In the past, mutual distrust and lack of understanding prevented many representatives attending this Congress today from considering taking joint action with peace advocates. These obstacles have now been eliminated, although not completely. The sole purpose of the initiators of the World People's Peace Congress is to convene those who cherish their different ways of life but wish to jointly find ways to solve the various problems that frighten all those who sincerely hope to maintain peace, to come together for free and effective discussions.

The past activities of the peace movement and its global nature give it the right to initiate the convening of this Congress. This movement has broad and powerful international support and has various effective permanent institutions, so it can provide valuable assistance in preparing such an important congress and ensuring its success.

Joliot-Curie said: If we merely analyze the laws of past development here in order to predict the most likely future development, or if we discuss the individual nature of the so-called "ways of life," then we will not reach a consensus. But there is one question that all of us here will answer affirmatively, and that question is: Can two different systems coexist peacefully? However, the meaning of the sentence "peaceful coexistence is possible" must be clearly understood. To admit that peaceful coexistence is possible means that one should reject—regardless of the advantages and disadvantages of this or that system—the desire to force the people of other countries to accept a certain form of government by means of war between countries; this means rejecting the spirit of the crusades completely, rejecting the concept of pre-emptive war, which is openly promoted by some and supported by others who dare not tear off their masks.

Joliot-Curie said that currently, there are some contradictions of varying degrees of seriousness between different countries. If we oppose the use of force to solve these problems, we have a responsibility to seek a solution through negotiations, and we must explore a compromise that can be accepted by all, a compromise that will ultimately meet everyone's common interests—this exploration is often very slow and difficult, but it is necessary.

He continued, saying that in order to ensure peaceful coexistence, we must try to ease the extremely tense situation currently caused by three wars, the arms race, and the atmosphere of the Cold War, in order to conduct general negotiations with the hope of achieving success.

Joliot-Curie said that first, we must try to ban weapons of mass destruction and establish supervision over the implementation of this ban. He pointed out that atomic bombs have already been used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The terrible consequences caused by the use of napalm bombs have aroused widespread protests in all countries. Finally, the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China has caused deep concern around the world. First, the report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, and then the report of the International Scientific Commission, which spent two months investigating these facts in Korea and China, have confirmed the use of these weapons.

He said that everyone must realize that if what is being done to Korea and China today is not stopped immediately, if no attempt is made to ban the use of these weapons, then tomorrow, each of us, all of our loved ones, will be in danger of becoming victims of these terrible destructive weapons. First, the 1925 Geneva Protocol must be approved, as requested by the World Peace Council. It must be pointed out that the United States has not yet ratified this protocol.

Joliot-Curie called on all scientists to demand that science serve the interests of the people and not be used to destroy them. Scientists must stand at the forefront of the people who are fighting to ban weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, broad progressive public opinion around the world must support this struggle. Is it not absolutely necessary to reach an agreement on the interpretation of the various events that have created this situation, in order to clearly identify the crisis that is threatening human security and jointly decide what steps should be taken first to prevent this crisis?

Joliot-Curie further called on the people to oppose the arms race, to oppose this heavy burden on the economies of all countries in the world. The peace movement has already proposed a solution to this aspect and has clearly written it in the letter from the Warsaw Peace Congress to the United Nations and in the resolution on disarmament adopted by the World Peace Council in Vienna in November 1951.

Often, some people believe that stopping the arms race will produce economic depression and unemployment, and they oppose stopping the arms race based on this. In fact, this argument is not worth refuting. They have put forward a false dilemma: "Either economic crisis or a high level of arms expansion," "Either military production or unemployment." We must use various specific suggestions to clarify that stopping the arms race and easing international tensions will promote the development of economic relations between countries around the world, and this is beneficial to all governments.

Joliot-Curie exposed the true purpose of the notorious Baruch (formerly translated as Baluqu) atomic energy control plan. He said: If this plan were adopted, then it would actually give the United States a real monopoly on the production of atomic energy, because the United States could use its well-known mechanical majority in the United Nations to control everything.

Joliot-Curie then spoke about another aspect of the issue of easing international tensions, which is the issue of cultural exchange. He said: The World Peace Council has strived to create various conditions to ease this tension. The World Peace Council has first initiated meetings of various different cultural figures—doctors, sculptors, and others—and organized broad international activities commemorating great leaders in the world of culture. He also spoke about the importance of scientific exchange between countries.

He asked, but as long as the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya continue for one day, can we really ease international tensions? If we want to determine which side is responsible for the outbreak of these wars, we may not be completely in agreement. But we must be able to agree to demand an immediate cessation of all hostilities as a prerequisite for further seeking reconciliation.

Joliot-Curie said that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference recently held in Beijing approved the idea of convening the World People's Peace Congress. Our Peace Congress will undoubtedly pay attention to the speech made in this regard by Mr. Kitchlew, the head of the Indian delegation and veteran of the Indian National Congress. He said that the Vienna Peace Congress is absolutely necessary. It will benefit from the work completed in Beijing. The Beijing meeting is not an isolated event. It is part of a single whole, part of the overall movement for peace.

Joliot-Curie then spoke about the issue of the national independence and security of the people of various countries. He emphasized that since the end of World War II, there have been more and more instances of blatant violations of the national independence of many countries. The independence of those countries has either been taken by other countries by force, or it has been sold out by their own governments in order to obtain foreign financial assistance or police protection and military protection, or other countries have used economic pressure to destroy their independence in reality or in law.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that atrocities, suppression, and even open wars, this is the answer that the people of Asia, Africa, the Near East, and the Middle East who are demanding national independence have received.

He emphasized that some people believe that in order to maintain security due to economic and technological development, it is necessary to establish supranational organizations. This argument is untenable. Joliot-Curie said: These people easily agree to sacrifice national independence. Many countries describe this act of sacrificing national independence as a necessary condition for national security. They say that the Atlantic Treaty and the Paris and Bonn Treaties have established a system of common security, but under these treaties, national independence is sacrificed in order to satisfy the United States' desire to establish military bases and obtain strategic materials and economic benefits.

Joliot-Curie further said: The fact is becoming clearer day by day that this system is an instrument of aggression, and it makes the security of the countries affiliated with this system extremely precarious. The countries in this system may be forced into wars that they do not want to participate in. The purpose of this system is to include the revived militarism and imperialism of Germany in the European Defense Group through the Bonn and Paris treaties. Therefore, this system is a great harm to the cause of peace. Prominent leaders in Western Europe have pointed out this danger with increasing frequency, but unfortunately, they have not yet revealed the danger of the entire so-called common security system. The situation in Japan is also the same. No country can have true security if it loses its independence. Conversely, only people who have gained national independence can demand that other countries guarantee not to violate their security.

Joliot-Curie emphasized, when talking about the work of the International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Problem held in Berlin, that a peaceful solution to the German problem by signing an agreement between the Four Powers and Germany is the first step to ensure true collective security.

He asked all participants in the conference to discuss issues with a desire to seek agreement, referring to the achievements already made, such as those at the Beijing Conference and the Berlin Peace Conference. He said that in this way, we can jointly lay the foundation for true collective security. Regarding this point, Joliot-Curie spoke about the tasks of the United Nations. He said that one of the main reasons for the current weakness of the United Nations is its lack of universality. Many countries still do not have their representatives in the United Nations. The United Nations cannot achieve peaceful coexistence at all without allowing the representatives of the 450 million Chinese people to participate. Their excuse for not allowing Chinese representatives to participate in the United Nations is that the Chinese have changed their regime in the period from the founding of the United Nations to the present. But they changed their regime without violating the will of their people; they only violated the will of one country, that country supported a very corrupt regime with military force, so that it was still of no avail even though it gave a great deal of assistance. It is absolutely incorrect to say that this great nation with thousands of years of culture, which is currently in an unprecedented period of vigorous development, can be represented by generals from Taiwan. It is impossible to attempt to solve world problems if one ignores such a vast continent on the map. Is it really conceivable that an international disarmament agreement could be signed without China's participation? Is it really conceivable to establish a system of control that must consider China to exist only on a small island under the protection of the US Seventh Fleet?

Joliot-Curie emphasized that one of the main principles of the UN Charter is the principle of unanimity among the great powers. Striving for unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council can only achieve compromises through negotiations. The normal activities of the United Nations organization have been hampered by the use of mechanical majorities and the desire to forcibly implement the will of this mechanical majority—a majority formed without considering population figures—through the United Nations.

Joliot-Curie said that the United Nations is currently in a stalemate. Negotiations on all major issues that divide the world cannot produce the peaceful solutions that the people of the world hope for. The UN Charter was created based on the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, but because the People's Republic of China has not been included in this organization, the five major powers cannot hold meetings within this organization.

In this situation, the time has come for us to appeal to world public opinion. The time has come for us, representing world public opinion, to tell the five major powers. We should say to the five major powers: Come together to discuss and take a step, a step that abandons various decisions based on force to open up the path for genuine negotiations.

Joliot-Curie said that in this regard, allow me, according to my personal opinion, to talk about the significance and political importance of the demands made to the five major powers, which, in summary, are: "Sign a peace pact, which will restore the true meaning of the United Nations."

I believe that the main thing is for the governments of the five major powers to sign a pact that determines the basic and stable conditions for world peace, and the maintenance of world peace depends entirely on them.

A pact concluded in this way among the five major powers, supported by the will of the people, will re-establish the conditions for good international relations in a new atmosphere, just like the conditions that existed when the United Nations organization was established. This time, the pact will be able to accurately guarantee that all countries abide by the spirit and letter of the UN Charter. The United Nations will achieve universality and will be able to fairly resolve differences of opinion that may arise between countries around the world. Finally, this pact, due to its main purpose of ensuring stable peace among the five major powers, will produce an important effect, making it possible for the United Nations to regain the means to fulfill its mission.

Joliot-Curie finally said to the representatives: We are representatives authorized by the people of various countries, and we have the right to call the attention of governments to the will of the people of various countries to strive for peace. We must respond to the hopes entrusted to us by the people with action, with peaceful action. We know what kind of destructive horrors are threatening all of humanity, but knowing this will not weaken our will to fight for peace; on the contrary, it strengthens our will to strive for peace. As enemies of all crusades, we must fight against lies, against inciting hatred, and against prejudice.

    在世界人民和平大会上
    世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里致开幕词
    【新华社讯】塔斯社维也纳十三日电：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在世界人民和平大会上发表开幕词。
    约里奥—居里在发言时，首先向参加世界人民和平大会的全体代表以及协助大会进行筹备工作的奥地利和平战士们致敬。他强调指出，他是代表发起这个广泛的世界人民和平大会的世界和平理事会致词的，世界人民和平大会是欢迎一切运动与组织、一切真诚地为缓和国际紧张局势而努力的人民参加的。
    约里奥—居里然后叙述了在世界人民和平大会举行以前各国所进行的大规模的筹备工作。他说：在各国中曾举行了许多次会议与集会，参加这些会议与集会的人有着各种不同的思想，这些人在此以前是从来不敢就和平问题交换意见的。他说：这种筹备工作有助于消除人民中间如缺乏信任和谅解之类的障碍，这些人民虽然遵循着不同的道路前进，但是他们都极热诚地努力争取达到这个共同的目标——世界的和平。在进行筹备工作的期间，已经在各个不同阶层的人民中间解释了世界和平理事会号召召开的世界人民和平大会的真正意义。各国人民实际上就是这个大会的筹备者，他们选出了具有极大广泛性的代表。谁也不能否认，这种有各个不同国家的代表参加的集会，在性质上真正是世界规模的。
    约里奥—居里接着分析了目前国际形势，他指出：当第二次世界大战的影响还没有被消除的时候，战争就在世界的三个地方进行着。危险的扩张军备运动正在进行，它破坏着某些国家的经济，阻碍着人类的进步，加深了另一次世界战争的危险。在保障安全的藉口下，缔结了一些公约、条约和协定，而在多数情况下，这些公约、条约和协定实际上只有增加战争的威胁。民族独立和民主自由所受到的威胁愈来愈大。冷战则借诽谤和造谣的办法在继续进行。有些人为了要制造发动十字军的空气，不惜在人民中间煽起狂热的情绪，为最可怕的战争作准备。
    约里奥—居里评论了利用科学成就于战争目的的问题，并在这方面追述了原子弹在广岛和长崎爆炸的事件。他说，直到现在，我们对于科学进步的有利的影响是有坚定的信念的，但是我们知道，如果科学为那些制造战争的罪犯所掌握，他们就得到破坏性更大的武器。这使我们可以想像得到第三次世界大战的后果。当目前几个地方正在进行战争的时候，当和平正遭受到很大的危险的时候，大家必须记住这些可怕的后果。
    有时，即使那些以各种方法努力保卫和平的人们，也没有想到这种可能的后果。否则怎样来解释，他们在危险临头之际，有时还就次要的问题或者和保持和平的真正问题甚至无直接关系的那些问题，进行毫无结果纠缠不清的争论呢？
    这种危险的局势是由于某种国际政策的结果，而这种危险，在战争结束后不久，许多人就已看到了。由于对于这种形势有了正确的估计，人们才采取主动，建立了消除另一次战争危险的力量。但是过去的经验是不应忽视的。我们大家都记得，在一九一八年到一九三九年期间人们为了避免第二次世界大战而采取的那些措施。国际联盟失败了，那个时代的非战主义运动（各世界和平基金会）也没有能组织成为一个强大的人民运动，从这些失败中，我们必须吸取教训。当时的问题在于，他们并没有能使祈求和平的每一个人相信保卫和平是和他们自己有直接关系的，他们必须为和平着想，而且他们是能够为这个事业工作的。
    约里奥—居里又指出，这些运动的弱点是由于缺乏团结一致的精神；领导方面闹分裂，后来甚至在运动本身内部闹分裂，结果就不可能采取有效措施。
    约里奥—居里继续说道，第一届拥护世界和平大会是在一九四九年召开的；召开那次大会是由于考虑到过去的经验，并且是由于这种信念：只有在广大人民群众中间才能找到真正的和平力量，因为他们遭受过战争的痛苦，而且只要他们不答应，战争是打不起来的。在那次大会以后，大多数国家里都发起了和平运动，世界和平理事会也成立了。
    约里奥—居里接着追述这样建立起来的强大的和平运动的各种活动，他促请大家注意要求无条件禁止大批杀人武器以及建立严格的国际管制以监督这种决议的实施的斯德哥尔摩宣言，要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言。他说，和平运动的所有这些广泛的活动，使得很大一部分舆论能够表示它的意志。这种强大的和平力量，已经对国际政治的发展起了有力的积极的影响，这种说法是绝不过分的。
    那些提倡必须以实力来保持和平的人，企图用虚伪的宣传来毁谤和平战士的活动。纵然他们在过去和现在企图在我们周围造成这种不信任的气氛，我们却坚持不懈地继续进行我们的工作，我们深信，我们能够使人们相信我们的诚意。
    今天这一点已经完全清楚了：和平运动大力促成的这个伟大的群众运动，是一个客观的现实，任何宣传和任何分裂这个运动的努力，都不能损害这个运动。
    约里奥—居里然后详细说到和平运动的任务和进一步发展和平运动的方法。他说，和平运动没有说只有它才代表和平的利益；将来它也不想包办这种活动。它不过是积极地以全力来帮助保持和平。
    出席这个大会的每个人都知道：假如舆论能够觉察到它的力量，它便能够容易地提供解决目前使各国分裂的各项问题的合理的妥协方案并使这些方案付诸实行。在这方面已得到了很大的成就，现在召开的世界人民和平大会就证明了这一点。
    约里奥—居里指出：参加这个大会的人来自极不相同的国家并具有极不相同的哲学、宗教、政治和社会见解。团结这些人民的是这样的一种了解，即：必须考虑一切和平力量的联合行动，大家在一起，就有可能发现并确定采取这些行动的办法。在过去，互不信任和缺乏了解阻碍了今天出席这个大会的许多代表考虑与和平拥护者采取联合行动。这种障碍现在已经消除了，虽然还没有全部消除。世界人民和平大会发起人的唯一目的就是召集那些珍视其不同的生活方式、但愿共同找出办法来解决那些使一切虔诚地希望维护和平的人们感到惊惧的各项问题的人们，共聚一堂，作自由的、有效的讨论。
    和平运动过去的种种活动和它所具有的世界性质，使它有权利发起召开这次大会。这个运动受到广泛有力的国际支持，并具有着各种有效的常设机构，所以它在筹备如此重要的大会并保证其成功方面，能够给予宝贵的协助。
    约里奥—居里说：假如我们在这里仅仅分析一下过去发展的规律以便预测极可能的未来发展，或者假如我们讨论一下俗称的“生活方式”的各别性质，那么，我们将不会获得一致见解的。但有一个问题是我们在这里的人都会作肯定的答案的，这个问题是：两种不同的制度是否可以和平共存？然而必须明确地了解“和平共存是可能的”这句话的意义。承认和平共存是可能的，就意味着应拒绝——不管这种或那种制度的优点和缺点——那种用国与国之间的战争来强迫其他国家人民接受一定形式的政府的愿望；这就意味着应全部拒绝十字军运动精神，应拒绝先发制人的战争观念，这种观念是某些人公开宣传的、并受到其他那些不敢撕破他们的假面具的人的拥护。
    约里奥—居里说，目前在不同的国家之间，存在着一些严重的程度不同的矛盾。如果我们反对用武力解决这些问题，我们就有责任利用谈判求得一项解决办法，我们必须探求得一项可以为全体接受的妥协办法，一项最后能符合大家的共同利益的妥协办法——这种探求往往是很缓慢很困难的，但是却是必要的。
    他接着说，为了要保证和平共存，我们必须设法松弛目前因三个战争、扩军竞赛与冷战气氛而造成的极度紧张局势，以便在可能取得成功的希望下进行总的谈判。
    约里奥—居里说，首先必须设法禁止大规模毁灭的武器及建立对实施这个禁令的监督。他指出原子弹已经在广岛与长崎使用过。使用凝固汽油弹而造成的可怖后果已在一切国家中引起了普遍抗议。最后，在朝鲜与中国使用细菌武器的事，引起了全世界深切的忧虑。首先是国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的报告，随后是曾经花了两个月在朝鲜与中国调查这些事实的国际科学委员会的报告，都证实了使用这种武器的事。
    他说，每个人都必须认识到，如果今日加于朝鲜与中国的事情不立即终止，如果不设法禁止使用这种武器，那么到明天，我们每个人，我们所有的亲人都将有成为这种恐怖的破坏武器的牺牲者的危险。首先，必须设法按照世界和平理事会的要求，批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书。必须指出，美国到现在还没有批准这个议定书。
    约里奥—居里号召一切科学家应要求科学为人民的利益服务，不得利用科学来毁灭人民。科学家必须站到正在为争取禁止大规模毁灭武器而斗争的人民的最前列。同时，全世界的广大进步舆论界必须支持这个斗争。在对于造成这种局势的各种事件的解释方面获致协议，以便明确地认定正在威胁着人类安全的危机，并共同决定首先应采取什么步骤来防止这种危机，这不是非常必要的吗？
    约里奥—居里进一步号召人民反对扩军运动，反对这种世界各国经济的沉重负担。和平运动已经对这方面提出了一个解决的办法，并已清楚地写在华沙和平大会致联合国书以及世界和平理事会于一九五一年十一月在维也纳通过的裁减军备的决议中。
    常常有些人认为，停止扩军运动，就会产生不景气和失业的现象，他们就根据这一点反对停止扩军运动，其实这种论据是不值一驳的。他们提出了一个虚伪的进退为难的说法：“要末是经济危机，要末就是高度的扩充军备”，“要末是军事生产，要末就是失业”。我们必须用各种具体建议来阐明：扩军运动的停止和国际紧张局势的缓和将促成世界各国经济关系的发展，而这样是有利于一切政府的。
    约里奥—居里揭穿了丑名远扬的巴鲁克（前译巴鲁区）原子能管制计划的真正目的。他说：假如通过了这个计划，那么实际上就是给予了美国以生产原子能的真正垄断权，因为美国可以利用它在联合国中的大家都知道的机械多数来控制一切事情。
    约里奥—居里接着谈到缓和国际紧张局势问题的另一方面，就是文化交流的问题。他说：世界和平理事会曾努力创造种种条件来缓和这种紧张局势，世界和平理事会曾首先发起各种不同的文化界人士——医生、雕刻师以及其他人士——举行会议，并且组织了纪念世界文化界伟大领袖们的广泛国际活动。他并谈到各国间进行科学交流的重要性。
    他问，可是只要战争还在朝鲜、越南和马来亚继续下去一天，我们真的能使国际紧张局势缓和下来吗？如果要确定这些战争的爆发责任在那一方，我们可能不会完全一致。但是我们一定能同意要求立即停止一切敌对行动作为进一步寻求和解的先决步骤。
    约里奥—居里说，最近在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议赞成召开世界人民和平大会的意见，我们和平大会无疑将注意到印度代表团团长，印度国大党元老克其鲁先生在这方面所发表的谈话，他说维也纳和平大会是绝对必要的。它将从北京所完成的工作中得到好处。北京会议并不是一个孤立的事件。这是一个单一的整体的一部分，这是争取和平的总的运动的一部分。
    约里奥—居里然后谈到各国人民的民族独立和安全的问题。他着重指出：自从第二次世界大战结束以来，公然侵害许多国家的民族独立的事情越来越多了，那些国家的独立不是被他国用武力夺去，就是由于它们本国的政府为了取得外国的财政援助或警察保护及军事保护而出卖掉，要不然就是他国利用经济压力而在实际上或法律上破坏了它们的独立。
    约里奥—居里指出：暴行、镇压、甚至公开的战争，这就是亚洲、非洲、近东和中东各国要求民族独立的人民所得到的答复。
    他强调说：有些人认为由于经济和技术的发展，要维持安全必须成立超国家的组织，这种论点是站不住脚的。约里奥—居里说：这些人轻易地就同意把民族独立断送掉。有许多国家就把这种断送民族独立的行为说成是国家安全的必需条件。他们说，大西洋公约和巴黎及波恩条约建立了一个共同安全的体系，但是在这些条约下面，为了满足美国建立军事基地和获得战略物资及经济利益的欲望，民族独立被断送了。
    约里奥—居里又说：事实一天比一天明白，这个体系是一种侵略工具，它使得隶属于这种体系的各国的安全极为危殆。在这个体系里的国家可能被迫投入它不愿意参加的战争。这个体系的目的是要通过波恩及巴黎条约，使得复活中的德国的军国主义和帝国主义包括在欧洲防御集团里，因此这个体系是和平事业的大害。西欧的著名的领袖已越来越频繁地指出这一危险，只可惜他们还没有把整个所谓共同安全体系的危险揭露出来。日本的情况也是这样。任何国家如果失去了独立，就无真正安全可言。反过来说，只有获得民族独立的人民才能够要求其他国家保证不侵犯他们的安全。
    约里奥—居里谈到在柏林召开的国际争取和平解决德国问题会议的工作时着重地说：四大国和德国签订一个协定来和平解决德国问题才是保证真正集体安全的第一个步骤。
    他要求所有参加大会的人参照已得的成就，抱着谋求协议的愿望来讨论问题，如北京会议和柏林和平会议上所做的那样。他说，这样，我们才能够共同奠定真正集体安全的基础。关于这一点，约里奥—居里谈到联合国的任务。他说，联合国目前软弱无力的主要原因之一是缺乏世界性。很多国家到现在还没有在联合国内有它们的代表。联合国不容纳四亿五千万中国人的代表参加，它就根本不可能求得和平共存。他们不让中国代表参加联合国的藉口是：中国人在联合国成立之日起到今天为止这段时期内改变了他们的政权。但是他们改变政权，并没有违背他们人民的意志；他们只违背了一个国家的意志，那个国家用军事力量支持一个非常贪污腐化的政权，以致它虽给予大量的援助也仍然无济于事。如果说这个具有数千年文化、目前正处在一个空前蓬勃发展时期的伟大民族可以由台湾的将军来代表的话，那是绝对不正确的。如果把地图上这样一片广阔的大陆置诸不顾，那就不可能企图解决世界问题。结果没有中国参加而得以签订一个国际裁军协定，难道这真是可以设想的吗？如果要建立一种管制体系而使这个体系必须认为中国仅仅是在美国第七舰队保护之下存在于一个小岛上。难道这真是可以设想的吗？
    约里奥—居里着重地说，联合国宪章主要原则之一的表现就是它的大国一致原则。在安全理事会中争取大国一致，这才能通过谈判以取得妥协办法。联合国组织的正常活动因使用机械多数以及想把这个机械多数——不考虑人口数字而形成的多数——的意志通过联合国强行实施的愿望而受到了阻碍。
    约里奥—居里说，联合国目前正处在一个僵局中。关于一切使世界分裂的重大问题的谈判都不能产生全世界人民所希望的和平解决。联合国宪章是根据五大国的一致的原则产生的，但是因为中华人民共和国没有被容纳于这个组织内，因而五大国不能在这个组织内举行会议。
    在这种情形之下，我们向全世界舆论呼吁的时候到了，我们代表世界舆论告诉五大国的时候也到了，我们应该对五大国说：大家共聚一堂来讨论并采取一个步骤，这个步骤要放弃各种以武力为基础的决定来开辟真正谈判的道路。
    约里奥—居里说，在这方面，容许我按照我个人的见解，谈一谈对五大国提出的要求的意义与政治重要性，这个要求概括地说就是：“签订一个和平公约，这公约将使联合国恢复它的真正的意义”。
    我以为，主要的是五大国政府签订一个公约，决定世界和平的基本与稳固的条件，世界和平能否维持完全决定在他们手里。
    一个这样在五大国间缔结的公约，受到人民意志的拥护，将在一种新的气氛中重新建立国际良好关系的条件，就像联合国组织成立时所存在的条件那样。这一次，公约将能确切地保证各国遵守联合国宪章的精神与文字。联合国将取得世界性并将能公正地解决在世界各国间可能产生的意见分歧。最后，这个公约由于它的主要目的在保证五大国间的稳固和平，将产生重要的效果，使联合国重新获得完成它的使命的手段。
    约里奥—居里最后向代表们说：我们是各国人民所授权的代表，我们有权利叫各国政府注意各国人民争取和平的志愿。我们必须用行动，用和平的行动来回答人民付托给我们的希望。我们知道什么样的毁灭的恐怖在威胁着全人类，但是知道这个并不会削弱我们为争取和平而斗争的意志；相反地它加强了我们争取和平的意志。作为一切十字军的敌人，我们一定要为反对谎言、反对挑拨仇恨、反对偏见而斗争。
