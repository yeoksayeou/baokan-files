    Factory Administrative Cadres Should Pay Attention to Political Work
    Gao Fangqi, Party Committee Member and Factory Director of Shenyang 321 Factory
    In the past few years, under the leadership and education of the higher-level Party Committee and administrative departments, and with the specific assistance of the Party Committee of our factory, I have come to realize that the frequent attention of factory administrative cadres to political work plays an important role in improving the political level of workers and ensuring the completion of national production tasks.
    I believe that the enterprise management of a socialist state-owned factory is to organize the economic and political life of all employees. The socialist nature of labor educates and changes the ideological consciousness of all employees. The socialist nature of labor itself contains the content of political work. For example, to implement planned management, it is necessary to educate and organize all employees to discuss and formulate annual production, technical, financial and other plans, as well as daily production plans and quota management, to organize rhythmic production, to improve daily equilibrium rate and shorten production cycles. For example, to implement technical management, it is necessary to educate the masses and mobilize them to implement technical operating procedures, technical quality responsibility system, technical safety regulations, technical inspection system, technical personnel's special responsibility and mechanical equipment maintenance and repair system. Other examples include the implementation of advanced wage systems, the implementation of cost accounting in workshops and groups, and the "individual accumulation manual" which will be developed into individual economic accounting, etc. All these must pay attention to political education in the work, and must be carried out through the consciousness of the masses. Because the level of political and ideological awareness of the entire workforce in the enterprise determines the quality of production. The labor of a conscious person and the labor of a person with a very low level of consciousness are significantly different, both in terms of the production process and the production results. For example, in April 1951, our factory conducted a spring safety inspection, but because we did not seriously carry out political education and fully mobilize the consciousness of the workers, the safety inspection basically failed. This year's annual production plan was formulated by fully mobilizing the masses, so that the production task increased by 40 percent compared with 1951, the cost was reduced by 6.8 percent, and the labor efficiency was increased by about 30 percent. In this year's production increase and economy practice campaign, we relied on all employees to formulate production increase and economy practice plans, and formed a mass movement to find tricks and make rationalization proposals, which made this year's production increase and economy practice increase the wealth of 50,000 tons of grain in addition to completing the national plan.
    How do enterprise administrative cadres carry out political work? My experience is: First, carefully studying and implementing the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee and administrative departments in connection with specific situations is the prerequisite for doing all work well. When we accept work tasks, we analyze the specific situation of our factory according to the spirit of the instructions from higher levels, and then formulate specific plans. At the daily meetings, cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League jointly check the implementation and propose improvement measures. At the beginning of this year's production increase and economy practice campaign, we analyzed that our factory's favorable conditions were: the technical level of the workers has been significantly improved compared with the past. Last year, 60 percent of the factory's apprentices, this year only 10 percent, and the rest have been promoted to technical workers. This favorable condition provides a new and powerful basis for us to formulate a production increase plan. At the same time, it has also improved the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees in completing national plans and production increase and economy practice plans. Therefore, one month after the production increase and economy practice campaign was launched, more than 1,600 rationalization proposals appeared in the factory, and most of these proposals have now been implemented.
    Second, the attention of enterprise administrative cadres to political work is by no means to replace the work of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, nor is it to abandon production and administrative work. But to grasp the enterprise management work, closely rely on the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, and cooperate to do a good job in political work.
    When each task begins, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, we study and analyze the ideological status of cadres and employees, and determine the methods, steps, and requirements of political work to ensure the completion of production tasks and administrative work. Usually, administrative cadres regularly report production situations and problems to the responsible comrades of the Party Committee, trade union, and the Communist Youth League at the meeting, so that the comrades of the Party and the comrades of the trade union and the Communist Youth League can also grasp the key issues in production, and strive for a common goal - to overfulfill the national production task. For example, during quality inspection, the administration tells the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League about the problems existing in product quality. After joint research, six key points for improving quality are found. Then the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League and other organizations mobilize and organize the masses to solve these key problems.
    To do a good job in political work, the administration must give strong support to the work of the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League. Administrative cadres should study various reflections from the masses obtained by the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League to improve administrative work. Administrative cadres should earnestly implement the instructions of the Party, respect the opinions of the factory's trade union, and regularly report the income and expenditure of the factory director's fund to the trade union, and vigorously solve the welfare problems of employees.
    Third, educate administrative cadres at all levels to do a good job in administrative work and comprehensively complete production tasks. The factory director should promote the entire administrative organization to do a good job in political work. Before the start of each central task, when formulating a plan, first unify the thinking of cadres (section chiefs, workshop directors, etc.), and clearly understand the key problems and the methods to solve the key problems. In this way, there will be a backbone to mobilize the masses, and the coercive and commanding style of administrative cadres can be avoided, and closer connections can be established with the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League and other organizations, and administrative production management work can be done well. For example, when the Second Workshop of our factory was conducting a trial production of a product, the foreman was afraid of affecting the completion of the group's production increase and economy practice plan, and sent a worker with a lower technical level to do it. After understanding the situation, in-depth political work was carried out among the workers in the group in a timely manner. As a result, the group selected the worker with the highest technical level to carry out the trial production, so that the trial production was completed on schedule, and the group's production increase and economy practice plan was also overfulfilled.
    I believe that when administrative cadres formulate plans for each central task, each section and workshop should include political work in the plan, and submit it to the factory's leadership for detailed review before implementation. If administrative cadres at all levels pay attention to political work, it will not only strengthen the strength of political work, but also continuously improve the political level of administrative cadres themselves.

    工厂行政干部应该注意政治工作
    沈阳三二一工厂党委委员  沈阳三二一工厂厂长  高方启
    几年来，在上级党委、上级行政部门的领导和教育下，在本厂党委的具体帮助下，我体会到工厂行政工作干部经常地注意做政治工作，对提高工人政治水平，保证国家生产任务的完成，有着重要的作用。
    我认为社会主义性质的国营工厂的企业管理，就是要组织全体职工的经济生活和政治生活。社会主义性质的劳动，教育着和改变着全体职工的思想意识。社会主义性质的劳动本身就包含着政治工作的内容。比如实行计划管理，那就要教育和组织全体职工讨论和制订年度生产、技术、财务等项计划和日生产计划及定额管理等，组织有节奏的生产，以提高日均衡率，缩短生产周期。比如实行技术管理，那就要教育群众、发动群众贯彻技术操作规程、技术质量责任制、技术保安规程、技术检验制度、技术人员专责和机械设备保养检修制度等。其他如实行先进的工资制度，实行车间、小组的成本核算以及将要发展成为个别经济核算的“个人积累手册”等等，也都必须在工作中注意政治教育，要通过群众的自觉来进行。因为企业里全体职工群众的政治思想水平的高低，决定生产的好坏。一个有觉悟的人的劳动和一个觉悟很低的人的劳动，无论从生产过程或是从生产结果上看，都是有显著区别的。例如，一九五一年四月我厂进行春季保安检查，因为没有认真进行政治教育工作，充分发挥工人群众的自觉性，结果保安大检查基本上是失败了。今年年度生产计划的制订，由于充分发动了群众，就做到了比一九五一年生产任务增加百分之四十、成本降低百分之六点八、劳动效率提高百分之三十左右。今年增产节约运动中，依靠全体职工制订了增产节约计划，并形成群众性的找窍门提合理化建议运动，使今年的增产节约在完成国家计划之外增加五万吨粮食的财富。
    企业行政干部怎样进行政治工作呢？我的体会是：第一，联系具体情况认真地研究与执行上级党委和行政部门的指示，是做好一切工作的前提。我们在接受工作任务时，都是根据上级指示的精神，认真地分析我厂的具体情况，从而订出具体计划，并在每日的碰头会上，党、行政、工会、青年团等干部共同检查执行情况，提出改进办法。今年增产节约运动开始，我们分析我厂的有利条件是：工人们的技术水平较过去有了显著的提高，去年全厂有百分之六十的徒工，今年只有百分之十了，其余都已升为技术工人了。这个有利条件，给我们制订增产计划提供了新的有力的依据。同时，也提高了全体职工对于完成国家计划和增产节约计划的积极性和创造性。所以增产节约运动展开一个月以后，全厂就出现了一千六百多条合理化建议，这些建议现在已经大部实现。
    第二，企业行政干部注意做政治工作，绝不是代替党和工会、青年团组织的工作，更不是放弃生产行政工作。而是要抓紧企业管理工作，紧紧地依靠党与工会、青年团等组织，协同做好政治工作。
    当每一项工作开始，我们在党委统一领导下，研究分析干部和职工的思想状况，确定政治工作的方法、步骤和要求，以保证生产任务和行政工作的完成。平时，行政工作干部经常在碰头会上，向党委、工会、青年团的负责同志报告生产上的情况和问题，使党的工作同志和工会、青年团的工作同志也能掌握生产上的关键问题，为着一个共同目标——超额地完成国家生产任务而努力。例如在质量检查时，行政上把产品质量上所存在的问题告诉党、工会和青年团，经过共同研究，找出了提高质量的六个关键。接着党和工会、青年团等组织就发动和组织群众，解决这些关键问题。
    要做好政治工作，行政方面必须给党和工会、青年团的工作以大力的支持。行政工作干部应该研究党和工会、青年团所得到的来自群众的各种反映，以改进行政工作。行政干部要认真执行党的指示，尊重本厂工会的意见，并经常向工会报告厂长基金的收支情况，大力解决职工福利问题。
    第三，教育各级行政干部，做好行政工作，全面地完成生产任务。厂长要推动整个行政组织做好政治工作。在每项中心工作开始前制订计划时，先统一干部思想（科长、车间主任等），明确认识关键问题及解决关键问题的方法。这样就有了发动群众的骨干，就可以避免行政干部的强迫命令作风，就能与党和工会、青年团等组织取得更密切的联系，做好行政生产管理工作。例如我厂二车间进行一种产品试制时，工长怕影响该组增产节约计划的完成，派了一个技术较低的工人去做。经了解后，即时在该组工人中进行深入的政治工作，结果该组选择技术最高的工人进行试制工作，使试制工作如期完成，小组增产节约计划也超额完成了。
    我认为行政工作干部在制订每一个中心工作的计划时，应该要各科、各车间把政治工作列入计划之内，交厂的领导方面详细审查后执行。如果各级行政干部都注意做政治工作，那不仅能加强政治工作的力量，而且能不断提高行政干部本身的政治水平。
