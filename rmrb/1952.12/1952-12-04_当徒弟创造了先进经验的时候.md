　　When Apprentices Create Advanced Experience
    (Our Correspondent  Gu Weijin)
    When the Shenyang State-owned Rubber Seventh Factory began producing rickshaw tires in the first half of this year, the quality was very low. The superiors required the quality to reach over 90%, but they could only reach 70%. The reason for the low quality was that the final process of outer tire vulcanization was not done well, resulting in defects such as scars, teeth, lack of glue, and off-center pressing, turning the products into second-class products and waste products.
    Gao Zecheng, the leader of the outer tire vulcanization group in the rickshaw tire workshop, has been thinking about improving product quality ever since he heard the factory director's call for increasing production and practicing economy, because this is the key to increasing production and practicing economy. He felt very sad seeing the current low product quality. He often thought: We are the masters of the factory, how can we be worthy of Chairman Mao if we just watch second-class products and waste products being produced! He worked hard to study technology and constantly experimented to improve operating methods. As a result, he found the trick of "low-pressure mold raising, high-pressure stable pot" and established a system of division of labor and responsibility, which improved product quality to 93%.
    Gao Zecheng's discovery of the trick to improve product quality was beyond Wang Yunfeng's expectations.
    Wang Yunfeng is Gao Zecheng's master, an old technical worker with 19 years of experience. His skills are good. For example, if there is a problem with the machine that no one can find, Wang Yunfeng can quickly find it and repair it. He is particularly proficient in outer tire vulcanization technology. However, now he never dreamed that his apprentice would be more skilled than him and find the trick.
    Was Wang Yunfeng really unable to find the trick? No, he simply lacked the courage and determination to find it. When product quality could not be improved and the leadership called for finding the trick, Wang Yunfeng had considered finding the trick. But another thought stopped him: When he was transferred from the Rubber Third Factory to work here in March this year, he had heard many people praise his high level of skill and his effective operating methods; the leadership also valued him very much, asking him to take charge of the most important process of outer tire vulcanization; and the surrounding workers respected him so much, calling him "Master" all the time. All of this made Wang Yunfeng feel very honored. In order to maintain this honor, Wang Yunfeng did not easily change the status quo of his work, and operated as he always had. However, finding the trick required bold and repeated experimentation with operating methods. The current machines are relatively old. If his experiment was unsuccessful and an accident occurred, wouldn't the dignified technical leader be laughed at? "Absolutely can't take this risk!" Wang Yunfeng gave himself such an order whenever he thought of this.
    The trick found by Gao Zecheng can increase production and save the factory the equivalent of 184 tons of grain per year. In addition to giving Gao Zecheng material and spiritual rewards and increasing his salary during salary adjustments, the leadership also called on the workers in the rickshaw tire workshop to promote and apply his advanced experience.
    A young worker asked Wang Yunfeng, "The leadership is calling for us to learn from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience, should we learn it?"
    This was Wang Yunfeng's second apprentice, Zhao Jinghai. He leads a team like Gao Zecheng. He was a little unconvinced by Gao Zecheng's advanced experience. He thought, they were both taught by the same master, what advanced experience does he have that is worth learning? However, now he still wanted to find out what his master thought first. Wang Yunfeng did not respond at the time. He felt very sad about this matter. He thought, "More than ten years ago, when I was learning technology, Gao Zecheng was still wearing open pants!" Later, he thought, "Gao Zecheng only started learning technology from me two years ago, but now he has created advanced experience, and the leadership is even calling on us to learn from him. Where should I put my face as a master?" Wang Yunfeng said angrily to Zhao Jinghai when he thought of this:
    "I don't care if you learn it or not, I'm not going to learn it anyway."
    "If Master doesn't learn, I won't learn either."
    In the rickshaw tire workshop, the leadership convened a meeting of workers to discuss the issue of learning from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience.
    The vast majority of the workers in the rickshaw tire workshop are apprentices. When they heard the leadership calling for them to learn from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience, many people had no idea and discussed: "Is Gao Zecheng's advanced experience worth learning?" "I don't know what Master (referring to Wang Yunfeng, hereinafter the same) thinks." "I heard that Master looks down on his trick and has decided not to learn it." "If Master doesn't learn, should we learn it?" "Let's wait and see, otherwise, if we offend Master, what will we do if Master doesn't teach us technology in the future?"…
    Now at the meeting, the workers were still watching Wang Yunfeng's attitude, dozens of pairs of eyes focused on Wang Yunfeng. Wang Yunfeng didn't say anything, and everyone else didn't say anything either. They stared at each other, and the meeting was silent for a long time.
    The chairman anxiously urged everyone to speak, and in the end, Wang Yunfeng only said a few empty words: "Yes, let's learn from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience, everyone learn, and complete the task."
    The meeting was inconclusive.
    However, in Wang Yunfeng's heart, there was a contradiction: he actually admitted that Gao Zecheng's advanced experience was good, and if it was promoted, the product quality would generally improve; otherwise, it would be difficult to improve product quality. He is the technical leader, and if product quality cannot be improved, how sad would that be! But if he promotes Gao Zecheng's advanced experience, how sad would that be!
    Wang Yunfeng was troubled by conflicting feelings. He tossed and turned at night and couldn't sleep. He was really unconvinced by Gao Zecheng's advanced experience. He came up with a countermeasure: relying on his more than ten years of technical experience, he must come up with something unique and find a set of advanced experience that is even better than Gao Zecheng's. "At that time, watch everyone come to learn from my advanced experience." Wang Yunfeng thought of this, and a rare smile appeared on his face.
    However, things were not that easy. Wang Yunfeng wanted to be unique and come up with another set of experience, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get any results. He was very anxious, but the more anxious he became, the worse things got: sometimes accidents even occurred in operation.
    ×                            ×                       ×
    Because Gao Zecheng's advanced experience could not be promoted, product quality was always low, and it was difficult to complete the production task. What should be done?
    The leadership was very anxious about this matter, especially Kong Weixue, the workshop director who directly led production.
    Kong Weixue is a cadre promoted from workers. He has always been active and responsible in his work, but he is a bit impatient and considers issues in a relatively simple way. He thought, "Wouldn't production be improved if the master promoted the apprentice's experience?" He was very dissatisfied with Wang Yunfeng, especially when he saw Wang Yunfeng wanting to be unique and come up with his own set, but he didn't get anywhere, and sometimes even caused accidents. His dissatisfaction with Wang Yunfeng completely erupted.
    In the workshop, in front of many workers, Kong Weixue severely criticized Wang Yunfeng, saying that his unwillingness to learn from his apprentice's advanced experience showed that he didn't understand the importance of increasing production and practicing economy; that his discarding the existing advanced experience and trying to come up with his own set was simply asking for trouble; that since he couldn't come up with it himself, he should learn from his apprentice, so why was he still self-righteous and unwilling to put down the airs of a master? Finally, he said:
    "If product quality is not improved today, the master will bear full responsibility."
    Based on his technical skills, Wang Yunfeng has always been respected. Now the workshop director's words made Wang Yunfeng blush and dare not raise his head, and he guessed that everyone around him was laughing at him.
    After the workshop director left, many workers ran to Wang Yunfeng, intending to comfort him. But they only called out "Master," and Wang Yunfeng interrupted them, saying, "I don't dare to be a master now…" He walked away dejectedly.
    When Wang Yunfeng was transferred from the Rubber Third Factory to work here in March this year, the leaders there encouraged him, saying, "Go to the new job, give full play to your skills, achieve work results, and we'll see you in the newspaper in the future." Wang Yunfeng firmly replied, "No problem, I will definitely achieve work results to answer everyone!" Therefore, after Wang Yunfeng came here, he was full of enthusiasm to do a good job. But now: his apprentice has created advanced experience, but he doesn't have any, and the workshop director even severely criticized him in front of everyone. When Wang Yunfeng thought of this, his heart was as painful as being fried in oil.
    "What qualifications do I have to be a technical leader here! Where should I put my face when I see people from the Rubber Third Factory in the future!"
    Wang Yunfeng planned to retreat and ask for leave to go home. However, he also considered that if he did this, others would definitely laugh at him: "Look how useless this kid is, he runs away when his work doesn't go well."
    Wang Yunfeng was in a dilemma. He didn't want to see people. He always kept his head down when going to and from work. Whenever he heard someone laughing, he suspected that they were laughing at him, so he quickened his pace and thought as he walked, "It's really frustrating to keep working like this!"
    Wang Yunfeng's depressed mood affected the entire workshop, causing product quality to continue to decline: from 70% to about 50%, and sometimes even accidents occurred.
    In the office of the workshop branch, branch secretary Luan Shuyun talked with Wang Yunfeng.
    Luan Shuyun had already discussed Wang Yunfeng's unwillingness to learn from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience with the Party general branch. Everyone felt that the biggest shortcoming in promoting Gao Zecheng's advanced experience during this period was that there was only a general call, lacking specific leadership; they were only anxiously asking Wang Yunfeng to learn from his apprentice's advanced experience, without understanding what difficulties there were and how to solve these difficulties step by step and in a planned way. Now, according to the instructions of the Party general branch, Luan Shuyun changed her past approach and conducted ideological education aimed at Wang Yunfeng's ideological obstacles. She first asked Wang Yunfeng kindly what difficulties he had in his work, what problems he had in his family life, and what opinions he had on the leadership. When talking about the issue of this decline in product quality, she first made a self-criticism, saying, "This is because I, as a leader, did not take care of you and did not provide you with enough help." All of this made Wang Yunfeng feel that this was completely different from the workshop director's casual criticism of people in front of everyone. He looked at Luan Shuyun gratefully. Luan Shuyun continued:
    "What do you plan to do about the problem of declining product quality?"
    Wang Yunfeng knew that the conversation was about to get to the issue itself, and thought, "No matter what, I cannot learn advanced experience from my apprentice; there has only ever been apprentices learning from masters, never masters learning from apprentices." So he said with a wry smile:
    "I have no way either. If I learn from other people's advanced experience, my brain is too stupid, I can't learn it."
    Luan Shuyun understood Wang Yunfeng's thoughts and patiently enlightened him:
    "You are Gao Zecheng's master, and the fact that Gao Zecheng can create advanced experience is inseparable from your efforts to teach him these past two years; Gao Zecheng's glory today is also your glory. You should help him improve and promote his advanced experience!"
    Wang Yunfeng listened silently, feeling that these words made some sense. Luan Shuyun continued:
    "Today, it is indeed very important to promote advanced experience and improve product quality. Making a second-class tire will cost the country more than 10,000 yuan. Now the workshop has made a maximum of more than 100 second-class products a day, which will cost the country more than 1 million yuan. The loss to buyers is not even counted. How can we talk about increasing production and practicing economy if things continue to develop like this?"
    Wang Yunfeng frowned and didn't speak for a long time. He also began to feel that the problem was serious, and he also calculated a detailed account for himself: "Losing more than 1 million yuan to the country in one day, I can't compensate for the country's losses even if I don't take my salary. I said I would respond to Chairman Gao Gang's call for increasing production and practicing economy, but wouldn't all of that become empty talk?" Wang Yunfeng thought, suddenly patting his head and saying:
    "Alas, the reason why product quality is not good today is all because I didn't learn advanced experience! I only cared about my personal face, and didn't care about the country's interests."
    Finally, Wang Yunfeng expressed to Luan Shuyun that he must learn from his apprentice's advanced experience.
    However, the next day, when he really had to learn from his apprentice, Wang Yunfeng was still a little embarrassed. He thought, "Can a master really learn from his apprentice like this?"
    The leadership convened another meeting of workers in the rickshaw tire workshop to discuss the issue of learning from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience. The meeting first required Gao Zecheng to respect his master, in order to obtain his master's help and promote his advanced experience.
    Before the meeting, Gao Zecheng had already received education on respecting his master, and understood the importance of respecting his master. Now when he saw Wang Yunfeng, he shook his hand warmly and said sincerely:
    "It was my fault that I didn't discuss with Master when creating this advanced experience. Looking back, if it weren't for Master's painstaking guidance, I wouldn't be where I am today! Even today, I have only created a little bit, and I still have to rely on Master to continue to help and guide me in order to meet the quality standards. The superiors require the quality to reach 99%, but I can only reach 93% now."
    When Wang Yunfeng heard Gao Zecheng's words, he recalled his jealousy towards Gao Zecheng since Gao Zecheng created the advanced experience: at that time, he didn't pay much attention to him, and sometimes even satirized him with cold words, saying, "Now you have two sets of skills, you are capable, you are amazing!" "Now I don't dare to be your master, I still have to learn from you!" But now, looking at Gao Zecheng, every word he said proved that the apprentice did not hold a grudge against him for what happened in the past, and the apprentice only sincerely asked him to help do a good job in advanced experience and improve quality in order to meet the quality standards. These things made Wang Yunfeng very moved, and he felt warm in his heart. In this way, Wang Yunfeng's contempt and dissatisfaction with his apprentice gradually disappeared. He said to his apprentice enthusiastically:
    "Okay, in order to improve product quality and do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, let's do a lot of research."
    The meeting continued in an atmosphere of unity between the master and apprentice. Everyone concentrated their thoughts to discuss how to summarize Gao Zecheng's advanced experience for learning and promotion. After everyone improved their understanding of Gao Zecheng's advanced experience, they felt that there were still some shortcomings in his advanced experience. At this time, Wang Yunfeng took the initiative to propose that his "two fasts and one slow" experience created in his operation could be added in, so that it could become a complete advanced experience. After research, everyone fully agreed with Wang Yunfeng's proposal. This made Wang Yunfeng very happy, thinking, "After all, my technology also has something worth promoting, and this time the advanced experience also has my share." He immediately expressed to everyone: Based on the advanced experience summarized now, he could guarantee that the product quality would reach 100%. The next day, under his active leadership, the product quality really reached 100%.
    After Wang Yunfeng changed, he sincerely called on the workers in the rickshaw tire workshop to learn from Gao Zecheng's advanced experience, saying, "Only by turning Gao Zecheng's advanced experience into everyone's experience can we generally improve product quality." Under his call, the workers actively took action. In order to help the workers improve their skills and master the advanced experience, Wang Yunfeng and many apprentices signed master-apprentice contracts, guaranteeing to teach the apprentices the technology on time. Recently, Wang Yunfeng has also created a trick to improve the quality of handcart tires through continuous efforts, and has received a reward from the leadership.
    Wang Yunfeng's transformation has also prompted the old workers in the neighboring workshops to humbly learn from other people's advanced experience. A upsurge of learning and promoting advanced experience has been set off in the factory.

　　当徒弟创造了先进经验的时候
    （本报记者  古维进）
    沈阳国营橡胶第七厂今年上半年开始生产力车胎的时候，质量很低。上级要求质量达到百分之九十以上，他们只能达到百分之七十。质量低的原因，是最后一道工序外胎硫化没有搞好，以致产品有疤拉、牙子、不上胶、压偏等毛病，变成二等品与废品。
    力车胎车间外胎硫化组长高泽成自从听到厂长号召增产节约之后，就一心想着提高产品质量，因为这是增产节约的关键。他看见目前产品质量这样低，心里很难过。时常想：我们是工厂的主人，眼巴巴看着出二等品和废品，怎么对得起毛主席呢！他努力钻研技术，不断试验改进操作方法。结果，找到“低压升模，高压稳锅”的窍门，并建立了分工负责制，使产品质量提高到百分之九十三。
    高泽成找到提高产品质量的窍门，出于王云峰的意料之外。
    王云峰是高泽成的师傅，是一个有十九年工龄的老技术工人。他的技术是不错的。比方说机器出了毛病，谁都找不着，王云峰很快就能找着，并把它修理好。他特别精通外胎硫化技术。可是，现在他做梦也没有想到徒弟比自己高明，找到了窍门。
    王云峰真是找不到窍门吗？不，他不过缺乏找窍门的勇气和决心罢了。当产品质量提不高、领导上号召找窍门的时候，王云峰曾经打算过要找窍门。但是另一种想法把他阻止住了：今年三月间，他从橡胶第三厂调来这里工作时，曾经听过好些人称赞他在那边的技术怎样高明，操作上怎样有办法；领导上也非常器重他，请他担负最重要的一道工序外胎硫化的技术领导工作；周围的工友又这样尊敬他，开口就是师傅长师傅短的呼唤。这一切，使王云峰感到非常光荣。为了保持这个光荣，王云峰不大轻易改变工作现状，该怎样操作还是怎样操作。可是，找窍门是要大胆地反复地试验操作方法的。目前的机器都比较老，假使他试验不成功，出了事故，堂堂的技术领导人不是要被人笑话吗？“决不能去冒这个险！”王云峰每当想到这里的时候，就给自己下了这样的命令。
    高泽成找到的窍门，可以给工厂全年增产节约相当一百八十四吨粮食的财富。领导上除了给高泽成以物质和精神的奖励、调整工资时提高他工资之外，并号召力车胎车间的工友推广应用他的先进经验。
    一个青年工友问王云峰说：“领导上号召学习高泽成的先进经验，咱们学不学？”
    这是王云峰的二徒弟，叫赵景海。他和高泽成一样领导一个小组的工作。他对高泽成的先进经验有点不服气，他想，都是同一个师傅教出来的，他有什么先进经验值得学习呢？不过，现在他还是先打听打听师傅的口气。王云峰当时没有答理，他对于这件事情，心里很难过。他想：“十多年以前我学技术的时候，高泽成还没穿裤子呢！”以后又想：“高泽成两年以前才跟自己学习技术，可是现在竟创造先进经验，领导上还号召向他学习，我当师傅的脸孔往那里搁呢？”王云峰想到这里，气愤地对赵景海说：
    “你学不学我不管，反正我就不学了。”
    “师傅不学我也不学。”
    在力车胎车间，领导上召集工友开会，讨论学习高泽成先进经验的问题。
    力车胎车间的工友绝大部分是徒工。当他们听到领导上号召学习高泽成的先进经验时，许多人没有主意，议论着：“高泽成的先进经验值得学习吗？”“不知道师傅（指王云峰，下同）怎样看法。”“听说师傅才瞧不起他的窍门呢，他决定不学了。”“师傅不学，咱们学不学？”“看看再说，要不然，咱们惹了师傅，将来师傅不教给咱们技术怎么办？”……
    现在在会议上，工友们仍然看王云峰的态度，数十双目光集中在王云峰身上。王云峰不作声，大家也不作声。大眼瞪小眼，会议沉默了好半天。
    主席焦急地催促大家发言，最后只有王云峰空洞地说了几句：“对，学习高泽成的先进经验吧，大家都学，完成任务。”
    会议没有结果。
    但是，在王云峰的心底里是有矛盾的：他实际承认高泽成的先进经验是好的，推广起来，产品质量就会普遍提高；不然，产品质量就很难提高。他是技术领导人，产品质量如果提不高，多难过啊！但是，如果推广高泽成的先进经验，又是多难过啊！
    王云峰被矛盾的心情苦恼着。夜里翻来复去睡不着，他实在不服气高泽成的先进经验。他想出了一个对策：凭自己这十多年的技术经验，必需来一个独出心裁，找出一套比高泽成更高明的先进经验。“那时候，看大伙都来学习我的先进经验吧。”王云峰想到这里，脸上泛起稀有的笑容。
    但是，事情不是那么容易的。王云峰要想独出心裁，另搞一套经验，偏偏搞来搞去，没有搞出一个结果。他非常焦急，但是越焦急事情越坏：有时操作上竟出了事故。
    ×                            ×                       ×
    由于高泽成的先进经验不能推广，产品质量老是提不高，很难完成生产任务，这样下去怎么办呢？
    领导上对于这件事情很焦急，特别是直接领导生产的车间主任孔维学。
    孔维学是由工人提拔起来的干部，工作一贯积极负责，但是性情有点急躁，考虑问题比较单纯。他想：“当师傅的把徒弟的经验一推广，生产不是就搞好了吗？”他对王云峰很不满意，特别当他看见王云峰要独出心裁，自搞一套，结果没有搞出名堂，有时反而出了事故时，他对王云峰的不满便全部爆发了。
    在车间，当着许多工友的面，孔维学狠狠地把王云峰责备起来，说他不愿意学习徒弟的先进经验，就是不懂得增产节约的重要；说他丢开现成的先进经验不学，要去自搞一套，简直是自找麻烦；说他既然自己搞不出来，就应该向徒弟学习，为什么还自以为是，不愿意放下师傅的架子呢？最后他说：
    “今天产品质量搞不好，当师傅的要负完全责任。”
    王云峰凭着自己这套技术，一贯是受人尊敬的。现在车间主任这一席话，说得王云峰面红耳赤，不敢抬头，估计周围的人不知怎样在耻笑他了。
    车间主任走后，许多工友跑到王云峰的面前，打算安慰他一顿。但他们只叫了一声“师傅”，王云峰就打断了他们，说：“现在我不敢当师傅了……。”他垂头丧气地走开去。
    今年三月间，王云峰从橡胶第三厂调来这里工作时，那边的领导同志曾经鼓励他说：“到了新的工作岗位，好好发挥技术，搞出工作成绩，将来在报纸上见面。”王云峰坚决地回答：“没有问题，一定搞出工作成绩，回答大家！”因此王云峰来到这里之后，曾抱着满腔热情要把工作搞好。但是现在：徒弟创造了先进经验，自己没有，车间主任还在众人面前把自己狠狠地责备了一顿。王云峰想到这里，心里像油煎似的难过。
    “还有什么资格在这里当技术领导人呢！将来见到橡胶第三厂的人脸孔往那里搁呢！”
    王云峰计划打退堂鼓，请假回家。但是，他又考虑这样做别人一定会笑话他：“看这小子多没出息，工作搞不好就溜掉了。”
    王云峰处在进退两难之中。他不想见人。每天上下班都低着头。偶然听到别人的笑声，便怀疑人家在耻笑他，加快步伐走，边走边想：“这样干下去，真是蹩气呀！”
    王云峰情绪消沉，影响到全车间，使产品质量继续降低：由百分之七十降低到百分之五十左右，有时还出事故。
    在车间支部的办公室里，支部书记栾淑云和王云峰谈话。
    栾淑云对于王云峰不愿意学习高泽成先进经验的问题，已经和党总支作了研究。大家觉得这一时期推广高泽成先进经验中最大的缺点，是只有一般号召，缺乏具体领导；只是焦急地要求王云峰学习徒弟的先进经验，没有了解这里面有什么困难，怎样有步骤有计划地去解决这些困难。现在栾淑云根据党总支的指示，改变了过去的作法，针对王云峰的思想障碍，进行思想教育。她首先亲切地问王云峰在工作中有什么困难，家庭生活有什么问题，对领导上有什么意见。谈到这次产品质量降低的问题，她首先自我检讨说：“这是我领导上照顾不到，对你帮助不够。”这一切，使王云峰感到和车间主任随便在众人面前把人责备一顿的作法完全不同。他感激地望着栾淑云。栾淑云继续说：
    “你对于产品质量降低的问题打算怎么办？”
    王云峰知道谈话就要扯到问题本身了，心想：“不管怎样，我是不能向徒弟学习先进经验；从来只有徒弟学师傅的，没有师傅学徒弟的。”于是他苦笑着说：
    “我也没有办法。学人家的先进经验吧，自己脑子笨，学不会呀。”
    栾淑云了解王云峰的心思，耐心启发道：
    “你是高泽成的师傅，高泽成能够创造先进经验，和你这两年努力教他是分不开的；今天高泽成的光荣，也是你的光荣。你应该帮助他提高和推广先进经验才对啊！”
    王云峰默默地听着，觉得这话有点道理。栾淑云继续说：
    “今天推广先进经验，提高产品质量，确实很重要了。做一根二等品的车胎，就要给国家损失一万多元。现在车间一天最多做过一百多根二等品，就要给国家损失一百多万元。对买主的损失，还不计算在内。这样发展下去，怎能谈得到增产节约呢？”
    王云峰皱着眉头，半天不说话。他也开始感到问题严重，心里也给自己算了一回细账：“一天就给国家损失一百多万，自己不拿工资也补偿不了国家的损失呀。自己说过要响应高岗主席增产节约的号召，这样一来，不是都成了空话吗？”王云峰想着，忽然拍着自己的脑袋说：
    “唉，今天产品质量搞不好，都怨我不学习先进经验！只顾个人面子，不顾国家利益。”
    最后，王云峰向栾淑云表示，一定要学习徒弟的先进经验。
    但是，第二天真正要向徒弟学习的时候，王云峰还是有点难为情。他想：“难道当师傅的就这样向徒弟学习吗？”
    领导上又召集力车胎车间的工友开会，讨论学习高泽成先进经验的问题。会议首先要求高泽成尊重师傅，以便取得师傅的帮助，把先进经验推广出去。
    会议以前，高泽成已经受到尊师的教育，了解了尊师的重要。现在他见了王云峰，亲热地和他握手，诚恳地说：
    “这次创造先进经验，没有和师傅研究，是我的缺点。回想过去，要是没有师傅那样费心的指导，那能有今天！就说今天，也不过创造了一点点，还必须依靠师傅继续帮助，指导，才能达到质量标准。上级要求质量达到百分之九十九，现在我才能达到百分之九十三呀。”
    王云峰听了高泽成的话，想起自从高泽成创造先进经验之后自己对他嫉妒的情形：那时自己不大理睬他，有时甚至冷言冷语地讽刺他说：“现在有两套了，能干了，不得了啊！”“现在我不敢当你的师傅了，我还要向你学习呢！”可是现在看看高泽成，从他嘴里说出的每一句话里，都证明徒弟并没有和自己计较过去的事情，徒弟只是诚恳地要求他帮助搞好先进经验，提高质量，以便达到质量标准。这些，使王云峰非常感动，心里觉得热呼呼的。这样一来，王云峰对徒弟的瞧不起、不服气之类想法也就逐渐消除了。他热情地对徒弟说：
    “好吧，为了提高产品质量，搞好增产节约，咱们多多研究。”
    会议在师徒团结的气氛中继续进行。大家集中思想讨论怎样总结高泽成的先进经验，以便学习和推广。当大家把高泽成的先进经验提高一步认识之后，觉得他的先进经验还有不够的地方。这时，王云峰主动提出自己操作上所创造的“两快一慢”的经验可以补充进去，这样就能变成完整的先进经验了。大家经过研究，完全同意王云峰的提议。这使王云峰非常高兴，心想：“到底自己的技术也有值得推广的地方，这一下先进经验也有我的一份了。”他随即向大家表示：根据现在总结出来的先进经验，他可以保证产品质量达到百分之百。第二天，在他积极领导之下，产品质量果然达到了百分之百。
    王云峰转变后，真心地号召力车胎车间的工友学习高泽成的先进经验，他说：“只有把高泽成的先进经验变成大家的经验，才能普遍提高产品质量。”工友们在他的号召之下，都积极行动起来。为了帮助工友提高技术，以便掌握先进经验，工云峰和许多徒工签订了师徒合同，保证按时教会徒工技术。最近，王云峰在不断努力之下，又创造了提高手推车胎质量的窍门，得到领导上的奖励。
    王云峰的转变，推动旁的车间的老工友也虚心学习别人的先进经验。工厂里掀起了学习和推广先进经验的热潮。
