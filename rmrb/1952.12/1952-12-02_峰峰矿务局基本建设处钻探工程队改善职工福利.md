    Peak Mine Bureau Basic Construction Department Drilling Team Improves Employee Benefits

    To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Drilling Team of the Basic Construction Department of Peak Mine Bureau, pay attention to improving the safety and welfare of employees, and many long-unresolved issues have been resolved. In the past, workers worked on drill rigs more than ten feet high without safety belts. Although workers sometimes used hemp ropes to tie their waists, they could not avoid danger. Now each layer of the drill rig and each drilling machine has a safety belt, and each worker is issued a safety belt, a set of overalls, and a pair of rubber shoes. Because the workers work outside the city, the leadership, in order to take care of everyone's health, has set up canteens and dormitories in the villages near the construction site, solving the difficulty of workers having to run four or five miles to take shelter from the rain when it is windy and rainy. Therefore, the workers have high enthusiasm for labor and all reflect, "With such good conditions, it would be a real disservice to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao if we don't work hard."

    峰峰矿务局基本建设处钻探工程队改善职工福利
    编辑同志：峰峰矿务局基本建设处钻探工程队领导干部，重视改善职工的安全福利，许多长期没有解决的问题，都得到了解决。过去工人在十多尺高的钻架上工作，身上没有保险皮带，工人有时虽用麻绳把腰部捆住，但也不能避免危险。现在每层钻架和每个钻机都有保险皮带，并给每个工人发一条保险皮带，一身工作服和一双胶鞋。因为工人是在城外工作，领导方面为了照顾大家身体健康，在工地附近的乡村里给安设了食堂和宿舍，解决了刮风下雨时工人要跑四、五里路去躲雨的困难。因此，工人们劳动热情很高，都反映说：“有这样好的条件，若不好好工作，真是对不起共产党和毛主席。”
