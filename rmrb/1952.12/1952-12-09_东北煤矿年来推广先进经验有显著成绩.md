Northeastern coal mines, in coordination with the Coal Mining Bureau, have summarized six advanced experiences since January this year that are decisive and of universal significance: Ma Wenzhi's drilling, Cui Guoshan's tunneling, Shi Yuhai's safe production, mechanized cyclical coal mining, parallel shaft operation, and prefabricated sheds. The promotion of these experiences in various mines has yielded significant results. For example, Ma Wenzhi's drilling experience has been promoted in half of the drilling rigs in the bureau, and the drilling efficiency of each rig has increased by an average of 55.9%. Since the promotion of parallel shaft operation, the average daily progress of the Xi'an shaft has increased from 0.413 meters to 1.598 meters. Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling experience has also been promoted in two-thirds of the rapid tunneling teams in the bureau. According to statistics from twelve districts and mines, prefabricated sheds have been adopted by 75% of tunneling faces by the end of September, generally increasing tunneling efficiency by 10% and saving pit wood by 8%.

In order to promote these experiences, the Northeast Coal Miners' Union convened a joint meeting of trade union chairmen from various mining areas in April this year. The meeting pointed out that promoting advanced experiences is the basic method for completing the production increase and economy campaign, and specific arrangements were made for various tasks in promoting advanced experiences. In May and June, the Northeast Coal Miners' Union and the Coal Mining Bureau organized four visiting groups in a planned manner, which went to Fuxin, Xi'an, Hegang, Jixi, Beipiao and other mining areas to visit, exchange advanced experiences with each other, and then organized three working groups to focus on inspecting the work of promoting advanced experiences in various mining areas and help the mines carry out promotion work. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the trade unions in various mining areas convened meetings to promote advanced experiences, organized mutual observation and technical performances within the mining areas, summarized experiences, and carried out rewards. However, at the beginning of the promotion, leading cadres at all levels had serious conservative ideas, lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of promoting advanced experiences, and the leadership of promoting advanced experiences remained at the level of general calls, lacking specific and in-depth organizational work. First, leading cadres did not understand the content and key points of advanced experiences. For example, more than 40 cadres in the Haizhou Mine of Fuxin were all calling for the promotion of Ma Liuha's and Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling experience, but few understood the content of rapid tunneling experience. Second, there was a lack of specific plans for promoting advanced experiences, and promotion was carried out blindly. According to statistics from the Jixi Mining Area in June, more than 600 kinds of advanced experiences and tricks had been promoted, but production efficiency had not increased. Third, the leadership was not actively supporting the promotion of advanced experiences. For example, the employees of the No. 1 drilling rig at 150 meters in the Fuxin Coal Mine proposed in April to change the fast wheel and increase the intermediate wheel (from 160 revolutions per minute to 180 revolutions per minute), but this had not been resolved until July. When asked the captain, the captain said, "The Geology Department knows." When asked the comrades of the Geology Department, they said, "We are drawing drawings," and "It is being made in the mechanical factory." For example, the use of "support frames" when drilling with air legs can reduce the number of people using one air leg from three to one, which can save labor and improve efficiency, but the leading cadres did not solve the problem of "support frames." Even the advanced producers sent the drawing of "support frames" obtained from other places to the leading cadres of Hengshan Mine, but they did not even look at it for half a month. In July, when the Northeast Coal Miners' Union inspected the work, it pointed out that this serious situation should be changed, and the mines have made some improvements. The following methods were mainly adopted: First, under the leadership of the Party committee, ideological mobilization was carried out among cadres and workers, advanced experiences were organized for study, models of advanced thinking were cultivated, visits, technical performances and self-criticism and criticism were adopted to enable leading cadres and the masses to overcome conservative ideas and clearly understand the importance of promoting advanced experiences and that promoting advanced experiences is the basic method for completing the production increase and economy campaign. For example, when the Yingcheng Mine promoted Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling experience, some leading cadres and workers believed that the geological conditions and drilling rigs in the Yingcheng Mine were different and could not be promoted. The trade union assisted the drilling team to first promote and promote in the Meng Zhaolin drilling site, creating a record of 22.7 meters per day, which was nearly four times higher than in the past. The mine leaders gave timely rewards and used the specific facts of the Meng Zhaolin group to criticize the idea that Ma Wenzhi's drilling experience could not be promoted in the Yingcheng Mine, and organized everyone to visit the Meng Zhaolin drilling site. In this way, it was quickly promoted throughout the mine. Now, four of the five drilling rigs in the mine use Ma Wenzhi's experience, and the average drilling efficiency of each rig in September increased by 67% compared with before the promotion. Second, formulate a plan to promote advanced experiences and organize promotion teams to go to the site to help promote. The Northeast Coal Miners' Union organized the Gao Kaifu bricklayer group and Zhang Yishan carpenter group of Fuxin to go to Jixi, Hegang, Shuangya and other mining areas to conduct technical performances to help promote segmented bricklaying, double-handed slurry squeezing method, five-way bricklaying method, and carpenter assembly line operation, which had a great effect. Third, organize technicians to go deep into the site to help promote, so that the promotion of advanced experience is combined with technical guidance. For example, rapid drilling requires the use of yellow mud, and the viscosity and concentration of the yellow mud must be appropriate. In July and August, many accidents were caused by improper use of yellow mud. After the trade union cadres and technicians studied and analyzed, it was found that the specific gravity of yellow mud should be 1.1 to 1.2. After implementation, accidents in September were greatly reduced. Fourth, under the leadership of the Party committee, the leading thoughts of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League were consistent, the steps were consistent, and the organizational role of each was highly exerted, which played a great role in promoting advanced experiences. For example, after inspection, the Jixi Mining Bureau found that many cadres were calling for the promotion of advanced experience, but they shirked each other when they encountered specific problems. After the Party committee studied and formulated a specific promotion plan, the cadres of the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League carried out specific division of labor. The promotion of advanced experience has been greatly improved. (Chen Gengfu)

    东北煤矿年来推广先进经验有显著成绩
    东北煤矿工会协同煤矿管理局，自今年一月后分别总结了马文志钻探、崔国山掘进、施玉海安全生产、机械化周期采煤、竖井平行作业、成品棚子等六种具有决定作用和普遍意义的先进经验。这些经验在各矿山推广结果已获显著成绩。如马文志钻探经验已在全局半数钻机中推广，每台钻机钻进效率平均提高百分之五十五点九。自推广竖井平行作业后，西安竖井平均日进由零点四一三公尺提高到一点五九八公尺。崔国山快速掘进经验也在全局三分之二的快速掘进队中推广。成品棚子的经验，据十二个区和矿的统计，九月末已为百分之七十五的掘进掌子采用，一般提高掘进效率百分之十，节省坑木百分之八。
    为着推广这些经验，今年四月，东北煤矿工会即召开各矿区工会主席联席会议，指出推广先进经验为完成增产节约计划的基本方法，并具体布置推广先进经验的各项工作。五、六月间，东北煤矿工会与煤矿管理局有计划地组织了四个参观团，分头去阜新、西安、鹤岗、鸡西、北票等矿区参观，彼此相互交流先进经验，随后又组织三个工作组，有重点地分赴各矿区检查了有关推广先进经验的工作情况，并帮助各矿开展推广工作。各矿区工会在党委领导下，曾召开推广先进经验会议，组织矿区内互相观摩和技术表演，总结经验和进行奖励。但开始推广时，各级领导干部存在着较严重的保守思想，对推广先进经验的重要性认识不足，对推广先进经验的领导停留在一般号召、缺乏具体深入的组织工作。首先表现在领导干部不了解先进经验的内容和要点。如阜新海州矿四十余位干部，都在喊推广马六孩、崔国山快速掘进经验，但了解快速掘进经验的内容的却很少。其次，表现在缺乏具体的推广先进经验的计划，而是盲目地推广。鸡西矿区据六月份统计，曾推广了六百余种先进经验和窍门，但生产效率未见提高。再次，表现在领导方面不积极支持推广先进经验。例如阜新煤矿一五○米一号钻机职工，在四月间就提出要改快轮，加大中间轮（由每分钟一六○转提高到一八○转），直到七月还未得到解决。问队长，队长说“地质科知道。”问地质科同志，则说“正在画图”；又说“在机械厂做呢”。又如用汽盖打眼时采用“支架”打眼，可由原来三人使用一台气盖减为一人使用，可节省劳动力，提高效率，但领导干部不给解决“支架”，甚至先进生产者把别处取来的“支架”图纸送给恒山矿领导干部，过了半月之久，他们连看也未看。七月，东北煤矿工会检查工作时，指出应改变这一严重情况，各矿才有所改进。主要采用了如下办法：第一、在党委领导下，对干部和职工群众进行思想动员，组织学习先进经验，采用培养先进思想的典范、组织参观、技术表演和展开自我批评与批评的方法，使领导干部和群众克服保守思想，明确认识推广先进经验的重要性和推广先进经验是完成增产节约计划的基本方法。如营城矿推广马文志快速钻探经验时，部分领导干部和职工，认为营城矿地质条件不同，钻机不同，无法推广。工会便协助钻探队，先在孟昭林钻场宣传和推广，创日进二十二点七公尺的纪录，较过去提高近四倍。矿的领导方面便及时给予奖励，并以孟昭林小组的具体事实，批判了认为马文志钻探经验在营城矿不能推广的思想，又组织大家前往孟昭林钻场参观。这样，很快地在全矿推广了。现全矿五台钻机，有四台使用了马文志经验，九月份每台平均钻进效率较未推广前提高百分之六十七。第二、制订推广先进经验计划，组织推广小组去现场帮助推广。东北煤矿工会，曾组织阜新的高开福瓦工小组、张义山木工小组，去鸡西、鹤岗、双鸭等矿区进行技术表演，帮助推广分段砌砖、双手挤浆法、五顺一丁砌砖法和木工流水作业，收效很大。第三、组织技术人员深入现场帮助推广，使推广先进经验与技术指导结合起来。如推行快速钻进要用黄泥浆，而且，黄泥浆的粘性、浓度要合适。七、八月份因用黄泥浆不适当而造成的事故很多。后经工会干部与技术人员研究，分析出使用黄泥浆的比重应是一点一至一点二为宜，实行后，九月份事故大为减少。第四、在党委领导下，党、行政、工会、青年团的领导思想取得一致，步调一致，高度发挥各自组织作用，对推广先进经验起了很大的作用。如鸡西矿务局，经过检查，发现许多干部都在喊推广先进经验，但遇到具体问题便互相推诿，经党委研究制订具体推广计划，党委、行政、工会、青年团干部进行具体分工后，推广先进经验工作有了很大改进。　（陈耕夫）
