    The Law That Production Relations Must Suit the Nature of the Productive Forces
    By Kang Shitan Dingnuofu (康士坦丁诺夫), Soviet Union
    
    I
    
    All those who carefully observe the life of modern capitalist society will believe an indisputable fact: that capitalism is undergoing crisis, decay, and profound decline. Productive forces are eking out a meager existence. Internal and external contradictions are intensifying. The parasitic nature of imperialist countries, especially countries like the United States, is strengthening. Laborers are becoming increasingly impoverished.
    
    The development of Soviet socialist society and the people's democratic countries presents a contrasting picture. What is seen here is: a high-speed pace of productive forces development, continuous increases in production, growth in the material and cultural welfare of laborers, and the flourishing of all aspects of social life.
    
    In 1951, the total volume of Soviet industrial production increased thirteenfold compared to 1929, while in most countries of the capitalist world, production remained stagnant around the 1929 level.
    
    What is the reason for such a vast difference in the development paths of capitalist countries and countries of the socialist camp? What is the root cause of this decline that capitalism is currently experiencing?
    
    Bourgeois ideologues give different answers to these questions. The characteristic of all these answers is first and foremost: they try their best to conceal the true causes of capitalism's decline, deny that capitalism is in a precarious state due to a deepening general crisis, and deny that capitalism has become an obstacle on the path of human progress.
    
    The most aggressive of bourgeois ideologues consider the "excessive increase" in population to be the root cause of all contradictions in capitalism. From this, they draw a crazy conclusion: stop the increase in population and eliminate at least half of the world's population. Representatives of this reactionary theory praise imperialist wars and defend all barbaric means of war and mass slaughter of humanity.
    
    So-called "geopoliticians" and racists who view various geographical conditions, and the issue of "living space" for so-called "superior" races as the root cause of all capitalist disasters, should be closely juxtaposed with this type of bourgeois ideologue. They are attempting to salvage the dying capitalist system through methods of predatory war. It is no wonder that American imperialists fear peace like fire.
    
    Yet another type of bourgeois ideologue believes that the root of the various contradictions and disasters of capitalism lies in the existence of the national sovereignty of various peoples, and therefore demands its abolition. They conceal the American imperialists' greed for world domination under the guise of cosmopolitanism.
    
    Still others believe that the root of the disasters suffered by capitalism is the "excessive" development of science and technology. An article was published in a French magazine with the shocking title: "The time has come to put scholars on the gallows."
    
    Among bourgeois ideologues, there are also those who believe that the reason capitalism is experiencing decline is due to the so-called "natural cycles of history." They say that everything in the world must go through the following stages: youth, adulthood, maturity, and finally old age and decline. Thus, "modern civilization," like ancient civilization (here referring to the civilizations of Greece and Rome – translator's note), has now entered its stage of decline and fall. They believe that the inevitable "demise" of capitalism is also the end of the world.
    
    The existence of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, their rapid development in economic, social, and cultural aspects, completely shattered all the reactionary arguments of bourgeois ideologues.
    
    What is the real reason for the decline of capitalist countries and the prosperity of countries in the socialist camp?
    
    Only Marxism-Leninism can answer this question.
    
    In his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," Stalin provided a profound scientific analysis of the laws of development of socialist society and the conditions and paths for the gradual transition from socialism to communism. At the same time, he revealed the fundamental reasons for the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, which is leading the entire system of capitalist slavery to inevitable destruction.
    
    Comrade Stalin taught that the deepest reason for capitalism's downward development, crises, and decline lies in the conflict between modern productive forces and capitalist production relations. Conversely, one of the deepest roots of the vigorous development of socialist society lies, first and foremost, in the complete suitability of socialist production relations to the nature and level of productive forces. The fundamental opposition between these two types of development can be seen from the speed of economic development in the Soviet Union and the United States. In the most recent twenty-odd years, the Soviet Union's industrial production has increased by an average of 20 percent per year, while the largest capitalist country, the United States, has only increased by about 2 percent. Moreover, this 2 percent increase is due to the militarization of the economy. These two figures vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Under the socialist system, the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces has gained a sufficiently broad arena for its operation.
    
    II
    
    As everyone knows, the production of various material goods constitutes the constant and necessary basis of life for every society. The mode of production of material goods determines the structure of society, the dominant social ideas in society, and the nature of political and legal systems. Changes in the mode of production cause changes in the entire social system, its social ideas, and its institutions.
    
    The mode of production has two aspects that are inseparably linked and yet different: productive forces and production relations. Productive forces express society's relationship to the objects and forces of nature. Production relations are the relationships between people in the process of producing material goods. The mode of production concretely embodies the unity of productive forces and production relations.
    
    The nature of productive forces determines the nature of human production relations. In the famous preface to "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy," Marx wrote:
    
    "In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production."
    
    Productive forces are the most active, most revolutionary, and decisive factor in social production. Initially, it is the productive forces that change, and only after this do the production relations change accordingly.
    
    However, production relations do not play a passive role in the development of productive forces. Although production relations arise on the basis of certain productive forces, production relations have an active effect on the development of productive forces, either accelerating it or hindering it.
    
    Stalin taught that new, advanced production relations that are in accordance with the nature of productive forces are the main, and indeed decisive, force for the powerful development of productive forces. Socialist production relations play precisely such a role. Conversely, old and outdated production relations hinder the development of productive forces and cause them to wither. What is happening in capitalist countries today can be used to prove this principle.
    
    Thus, production relations can exert a powerful promoting effect on productive forces, but they can also become fetters, obstacles, and hindrances that cause productive forces to fall into a state of withering. For what reasons does such a change occur in the role of production relations?
    
    The thing is that production relations lag behind the changes in productive forces in their own development, and thus production relations gradually become no longer suited to the productive forces. Therefore, production relations change from a major promoter of productive forces development into an obstacle.
    
    For example, capitalist production relations were fully suited to the nature and level of productive forces during the period when capitalism replaced feudalism. These production relations ensured that productive forces achieved unprecedented high-speed development in human history at that time. However, the vigorous development of productive forces, the enormous socialization of labor achieved in capitalist society, later came into conflict with the capitalist form of ownership. Capitalist production relations changed from a form of development of productive forces into a fetter on productive forces.
    
    As early as 1913, Lenin wrote:
    
    "Everywhere one comes across tasks which mankind is quite capable of accomplishing at once. Capitalism stands in the way. It has amassed enormous wealth— and has turned men into slaves of this wealth. It has solved the most complex technical problems—and has blocked the implementation of technical improvements because of the poverty and ignorance of millions, because of the stupid avarice of a handful of millionaires." (Lenin Collected Works, Volume 19, Page 349)
    
    One of the greatest achievements of modern science—atomic energy—is used by American imperialism for purposes of aggression and destruction. The entire development of American science and technology is subordinate to the task of preparing for new wars, that is, subordinate to the task of slaughtering hundreds of millions of people. This shows that civilized barbarism has now become the most prominent feature of capitalism. Capitalist production relations have become fetters on the development of productive forces.
    
    Productive forces can only be fully developed when production relations are suited to the nature and situation of productive forces and provide productive forces with a broad arena for their operation. Comrade Stalin taught that production relations cannot lag too long behind the growth of productive forces and be in a contradictory position with them.
    
    "...No matter how much production relations lag behind the development of productive forces," Stalin pointed out, "they must sooner or later, and certainly will, be adapted to the level of development of productive forces, to the nature of productive forces. Otherwise, there will be a fundamental disruption of the unity of productive forces and production relations in the production system, the breakdown of all production, an economic crisis, and the destruction of productive forces." ("Problems of Leninism," Russian edition, page 592; Chinese edition, page 725) The essence of the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces is simply and clearly expressed in Stalin's principle.
    
    In mature capitalist society, the suitability of production relations to the nature of productive forces has been destroyed. From this arises economic crises and turmoil that lead capitalism on the road to inevitable destruction.
    
    Wars resulting from the conflict between modern productive forces and capitalist production relations cause the greatest destruction of productive forces. Economic crises bring the same disasters to the people of all countries. The material losses suffered by the people of all countries during the world economic crisis of 1929-1933 and the subsequent depression were equal to the losses caused by the imperialist war of 1914-1918. Thus, capitalism has plunged humanity into an abyss of bloody wars and periodic, devastating crises. The reason for this is the historically outdated capitalist production relations.
    
    However, if capitalist production relations hinder the development of productive forces, then why have they not yet been replaced by socialist production relations, as required by the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces?
    
    Comrade Stalin pointed out the following characteristics of economic laws that differ from natural laws: if the discovery and utilization of natural laws can be carried out relatively smoothly, then the discovery and utilization of new economic laws will harm the interests of decadent and reactionary social forces, and thus encounter the strongest resistance from this force.
    
    The situation with the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces is exactly like this. This law has long been paving the way for itself in capitalist countries. However, the reactionary imperialist bourgeoisie, which is desperately trying to preserve capitalism forever, is stubbornly resisting the operation of this law.
    
    Therefore, there needs to be a social revolutionary force that is powerful enough to destroy this resistance and pave the way for the operation of the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces.
    
    III
    
    As a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the conflict between productive forces and production relations was resolved in the Soviet Union; by eliminating capitalist production relations and replacing them with socialist production relations, production relations have become fully suited to the nature of productive forces. Therefore, the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces has gained a broad arena for its full operation. The revolutionary social force that paved the way for the development of the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces was the alliance of workers and peasants, which arose under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin.
    
    Some economists believe that the Soviet regime seems to have eliminated the old economic laws and formulated and created new economic laws to replace these old laws. Comrade Stalin exposed the erroneous and idealistic nature of these statements. In describing the great historical role played by the Soviet regime in eliminating capitalism and establishing the socialist system, Comrade Stalin wrote:
    
    "This task was undoubtedly difficult and complex, and without precedent. However, the Soviet regime gloriously completed this task, but it completed this task not because it seemed to eliminate the existing economic laws, 'formulate' new economic laws, but only because it relied on the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces. In the past, our productive forces, especially productive forces in industry, were social in nature, but the form of ownership was private, capitalist. Based on the economic law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces, the Soviet regime collectivized the means of production and made them the property of the entire people, thereby eliminating the system of exploitation and creating a socialist economic form. Without this law, without relying on this law, the Soviet regime could not have completed its task." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," Chinese edition, People's Publishing House, pages 5-6)
    
    The suitability of production relations to the nature of productive forces also exists in the rising stages of development of other social formations. However, in the Soviet Union, this suitability was determined for the first time in history on the basis of socialist production relations; and socialist production relations not only open up infinitely broad prospects for technological development, but also for the most important productive force—the laborers themselves.
    
    The establishment of the suitability of production relations to the nature of productive forces in the Soviet Union has ensured the continuity of productive forces development and the historically unprecedented high-speed pace of socialist production growth. Along with this growth, the material and cultural welfare of the entire people is also constantly improving.
    
    Socialist production relations are the main and decisive force for the powerful development of productive forces in socialist society.
    
    There is a view that production relations seem to only play a negative role as an obstacle to the development of productive forces. Comrade Stalin pointed out the absurd, vulgar, and anti-Marxist nature of this view.
    
    Those anti-Marxist views that seek the main source of productive forces development in geographical conditions, population growth, scientific development, the "self-movement" of productive forces viewed as purely technical processes, etc., have been fatally struck by Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin's discourse on production relations as the main promoter of productive forces has great significance for economists and historians who have the mission of scientifically elucidating the reasons for the demise and prosperity of different socio-economic formations. The law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces enables our cadres to more deeply understand the process of socialist economic development, and to take the necessary measures in a timely manner that arise from the requirements of this law.
    
    Comrade Stalin pointed out the error of the view that regards the complete suitability of socialist production relations to the nature of the productive forces as something solidified, determined once and for all.
    
    "...The saying 'complete suitability' cannot be understood in an absolute sense," Comrade Stalin wrote. "This saying cannot be understood as if there is no phenomenon of production relations lagging behind the growth of productive forces under the socialist system. Productive forces are the most active and revolutionary force in production. Even under the socialist system, this force undeniably comes before production relations. Production relations are only transformed after a period of time to suit the nature of the productive forces." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," Chinese edition, People's Publishing House, pages 45-46)
    
    Therefore, even under socialist conditions where production relations are the most advanced and reactionary social forces no longer exist, contradictions will still arise between productive forces and production relations. However, the characteristic of socialist society is that society plans and resolves the various contradictions that occur in the mode of production here in a timely manner, and things usually do not reach the point of conflict. But to achieve this, there needs to be the correct and scientifically based policy of the Communist Party; this policy is based on the knowledge of economic laws, and especially the knowledge of the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces.
    
    Therefore, Comrade Stalin taught Soviet cadres to carefully study various economic processes, master economic laws, and consciously utilize these laws for the benefit of communist construction.
    
    In order not to be slaves to economic laws, one should recognize these laws and formulate policies based on these laws rather than violating these laws. The ever-victorious strength of Stalin's Communist Party policy lies in consciously and skillfully utilizing economic laws. The instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on formulating a five-year plan for the development of the Soviet Union, which is designed to achieve a new powerful upsurge in socialist production, are based on the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces, and on the basic economic law of socialism.
    
    One of the greatest superiorities of our Party has always been, and still is, that based on the Marxist science of the laws of social development, it can foresee the course of events, and formulate its own policies not haphazardly, but based on the knowledge of objective economic laws.
    
    IV
    
    In the struggle to realize the gradual transition from socialism to communism, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has obtained Stalin's brilliant new work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," which illuminates the future path of socialist society like a powerful searchlight, as its ideological weapon.
    
    Comrade Stalin taught everyone how to apply objective economic laws for the benefit of communist construction, and in particular how to consciously and skillfully utilize the economic law that production relations must suit the productive forces in the stage of gradual transition from socialism to communism.
    
    "...The task of the leading organs," Comrade Stalin wrote, "is to timely discover the growing contradictions, and take timely measures to adapt production relations to the growth of productive forces, to overcome this contradiction. This is primarily related to the economic phenomena of collective farm group ownership and commodity circulation" ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," Chinese edition, People's Publishing House, page 61).
    
    Comrade Stalin taught that in order to eliminate these emerging contradictions, it is necessary to gradually raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, and gradually replace commodity circulation with a system of product exchange.
    
    This transition from the two forms of socialist ownership, from the two socialist production sectors, to a unified ownership by the whole people, to a unified and all-encompassing production sector, should be realized in a way that benefits the collective farms, and thus also benefits the whole society, so as to raise the form of collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people. Communism is incompatible with commodity circulation, so it is necessary to gradually realize the transition from commodity circulation to product exchange.
    
    In order to complete such a transition, it is necessary to greatly increase the quantity of products transferred from the cities to the countryside. Therefore, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the transition from commodity circulation to product exchange should be realized without special haste, along with the degree of accumulation of industrial products necessary for the countryside.
    
    Thus, we see that the law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces is an objective law that operates throughout the entire historical process of human society, in all social formations. This law is the key to understanding the historical inevitability of the demise of outdated social systems and the emergence and prosperity of new social systems.
    
    The law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces enables us to understand why capitalism is undergoing decline, and why the social ideology of the modern bourgeoisie, its political and other systems, have such a reactionary nature. On the other hand, this law also reveals the historical inevitability of the growth and unity of advanced social forces, the most widespread dissemination of great modern advanced social thought, communist thought, and the historical inevitability of their victory. The law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces, the conscious application and skillful utilization of this law by socialist society, ensures the powerful development of productive forces necessary for the transition to communism.
    
    Marx first discovered the law that production relations suit the productive forces. Comrade Stalin's historical achievement lies in the fact that in his brilliant works, he provided a clear and comprehensive theoretical exposition of this law, provided a classic definition of this law, and revealed the great significance of this law in the working class's struggle against capitalism. Comrade Stalin summarized the experience of the Great October Socialist Revolution, summarized the emergence and development of socialist society, and further analyzed the role played by this law under new historical conditions.
    
    In his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," Comrade Stalin exposed the increasingly deep contradictions of capitalism, and gave a devastating blow to the entire ideological system of imperialism, to subjective idealist bourgeois political economy and sociology. The objective economic law that production relations must suit the nature of the productive forces and other economic laws are the laws that determine the demise of capitalism. These laws arouse fear and terror in the bourgeoisie and bourgeois ideologues. Therefore, the bourgeoisie does not recognize the objectivity and truth of these laws. Therefore, the bourgeoisie also hates the Marxist science about these laws. The mission of bourgeois ideologues and bourgeois lackey scholars is to overthrow Marxism, and to sing some little tunes about the fate of capitalism to the bourgeoisie that can give them some comfort. The bourgeoisie also gives them money for this service.
    
    In our era, only the most advanced force of modern times—the working class and its political party—is truly concerned with discovering and consciously utilizing the objective economic laws of social development for the benefit of the entire society.
    
    The working class and its Marxist party draw from these laws the source of unwavering belief and strength in the victory of socialism throughout the world. Comrade Stalin, with his new brilliant works, ideologically armed the advanced social forces of modern times. He armed our Party with a scientific program of communist construction based on the utilization of objective economic laws.
    
    The Marxist-Leninist science on the objective nature of the laws of social development, which has been creatively developed by Comrade Stalin's great genius, is a reliable and tested weapon in communist construction.

    生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则
    苏联  康士坦丁诺夫
    一
    所有细心地观察现代资本主义社会底生活的人们都会相信一个无可争辩的事实，那就是资本主义正在经受着危机、腐朽和深刻的衰败。生产力在苟延残喘。内部与外部的矛盾正在尖锐化。帝国主义国家，特别是像美国这样的国家的寄生性加强起来。劳动者日益贫困。
    苏维埃社会主义社会和各人民民主国家底发展所呈现的景象则与此相反。在这里所看到的是：生产力发展的高速步调，生产的不断高涨，劳动者物质与文化福利的增长，社会生活一切方面的繁荣。
    一九五一年苏联工业生产的总量比起一九二九年来增加到十三倍，而在大多数资本主义世界的国家里则生产还是停滞在一九二九年水平左右。
    资本主义国家和社会主义阵营国家发展道路之如此悬殊是什么原因呢？资本主义现在所经受的这种衰败情况又是根源于什么呢？
    对于这些问题，资产阶级的思想家给了不同的回答。所有这些回答的特点首先就是：他们极力想隐瞒资本主义衰败底真正原因，否认资本主义由于日益加深的总危机而处于四面楚歌的状态，否认资本主义已经成了人类进步发展底道路上的障碍。
    资产阶级最带有侵略性的那些思想家认为人口底
    “过度增加”是资本主义一切矛盾的根源。从这里他们就作出了一个疯狂的结论：阻止人口的增加，把全世界的人口至少消灭一半。这一反动理论的代表者歌颂帝国主义战争，为一切战争的和大量屠杀人类的野蛮手段辩护。
    把各种地理条件、把关于所谓“高等”种族的
    “生存空间”的问题看成是资本主义一切灾难底根源的所谓“地缘政治学家”和种族主义者，是应该紧接地和这一类资产阶级思想家并列到一起的。他们在企图用掠夺战争的方法来挽救日趋灭亡的资本主义制度。这就难怪美国帝国主义者像害怕火一样地害怕和平了。
    再有一类的资产阶级思想家认为资本主义的各种矛盾和灾害的根源是由于有各族人民底国家主权的存在，因而要求取消它。他们把美国帝国主义者对于世界统治权的贪求掩蔽在世界主义底宣传下面。
    另外还有一些人认为资本主义所遭受的灾害底根源是科学与技术底“过度的”发达。在一本法国的杂志上曾刊载过一篇文章，这篇文章的标题是骇人听闻的：“把学者们推上绞首台的时候到了”。
    在资产阶级的思想家中间还有这样的一些人，他们以为资本主义所以在经受着衰落情况的原因是由于所谓“历史底自然循环”。他们说世界上的一切事物都要经过下面的几个阶段：青年、成年、壮年而最后是老年和衰败期。因而“现代文明”就和古代文明（此处通指希腊罗马时代的文明——译者注）一样，现在已进入了自身的衰败、没落底阶段。他们认为资本主义底不可避免的“灭亡”也就是世界的末日。
    苏联和各人民民主国家底存在，它们在经济、社会和文化方面突飞猛进的发展，彻底粉碎了资产阶级思想家底一切反动的论断。
    资本主义国家的衰败和社会主义阵营国家的繁荣其真正的原因是在什么地方呢？
    只有马克思列宁主义才能够回答这个问题。
    斯大林在其天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中对于社会主义社会底发展法则和从社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡的条件和道路作了深刻的科学的分析，同时他揭示了正在把资本主义奴隶制度的全部体系引向不可避免的灭亡道路的资本主义总危机深刻化底那些根本原因。
    斯大林同志教导说，资本主义的走下坡路的发展、危机、衰败底最深刻的原因是在于现代生产力和资本主义生产关系的冲突。而相反地，社会主义社会蓬勃发展最深刻的根源之一首先就是在于社会主义生产关系和生产力底性质、水平完全适合。从苏联和美国经济发展的速度就可以看到这两种发展类型底根本对立。在最近的二十多年中间，苏联的工业生产每年的增加平均是百分之二十，但同时最大的资本主义国家美国的增加大约只有百分之二。而且是由于经济底军国主义化才有了这百分之二的增加。这两个数目鲜明地表示出社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的优越性。在社会主义制度下，生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的这一法则获得了发生作用的充分广阔场所。
    二
    大家知道，各种物质资料的生产构成了每个社会经常的、必要的生活基础。物质资料的生产方式决定社会的结构，决定社会中占统治地位的社会思想、还有政治与法律制度底性质。生产方式的改变则引起全部社会制度，它的社会思想和制度的改变。
    生产方式有相互不可分割地联系在一起、同时又不相同的两个方面：生产力与生产关系。生产力所表现的是社会对于自然界的物体和力量的关系。生产关系就是物质资料的生产过程中人与人之间的关系。生产方式具体地表现了生产力和生产关系底统一。
    生产力的性质决定人类生产关系的性质。在“政治经济学批判”一书的著名序言里，马克思写到：
    “人们在自己生活的社会生产中，彼此间发生
    一定的、必要的、不以他们的意志为转移的关
    系，即与他们当时的物质生产力发展程度相适合
    的生产关系。”
    生产力是社会生产底最活动、最革命的同时又是具有决定性的因素。最初是生产力改变，而只有在此以后，生产关系才与之相适合地改变。
    但是生产关系在生产力的发展上所起的并不是消极的作用。生产关系虽然是在一定的生产力的基础上发生，但是生产关系对于生产力的发展却发生积极的作用，或是加速它或是阻滞它。
    斯大林教导说，与生产力性质相适合的新的、先进的生产关系是生产力强大发展底主要的、而且是具有决定性的力量。社会主义的生产关系所起的正是这样的一种作用。相反地，老旧的、过了时的生产关系却阻滞生产力的发展，使生产力萎靡下去。现时在资本主义国家里所发生的事情就可以用来为这一原理作证明。
    这样，生产关系对于生产力就可以起强大的推动作用，但是生产关系也可以成为使生产力陷入萎靡状态的桎梏、障碍物、阻碍物。由于怎样的一些原因才会使生产关系的作用发生这样的改变呢？
    事情就是在于，生产关系在其本身的发展中落后于生产力的改变，从而生产关系也就逐渐地不再与生产力相适合了。因此，生产关系就从生产力发展的一个主要推进者变成一个阻碍物。
    例如，资本主义的生产关系在资本主义代替封建制度的时期曾经是完全与生产力底性质与水平相适合的。这种生产关系保证生产力获得了当时人类历史上空前的高速发展。但是生产力底强力发展，在资本主义社会中所实现的、巨大的社会化的劳动后来和资本主义的所有制形式发生了冲突。资本主义的生产关系就从生产力发展的形式变成了生产力的桎梏。
    早在一九一三年列宁就曾经写道：
    “不拘是在什么地方——每走一步你都会遇到那些人类完全可以立即解决的任务。资本主义在起着阻碍作用。资本主义积累了大量的财富，并且把人们变成了这一财富底奴隶。它解决了那些最复杂的技术问题，但是由于亿万的居民底贫困与无知，由于一小撮百万富翁底冥顽不灵的吝啬，它就阻碍实施这些技术上的改善。”（列宁全
    集，第十九卷，第三四九页）
    现代科学底最伟大的成就之一——原子能——被美国帝国主义利用于侵略和破坏的目的。美国科学和技术底全部发展从属于准备新战争的勾当，也就是从属于屠杀亿万人民的勾当。这一点就说明，文明的野蛮行为现在已经成为资本主义最突出的特色了。资本主义生产关系成了生产力发展的桎梏。
    只有在生产关系与生产力底性质、情况相适合并且使生产力有发生作用的广阔场所的时候，生产力才能够获得充分的发展。斯大林同志教导说，生产关系不能够过分长久地落后于生产力的增长并和生产力处于相互矛盾的地位。
    “……无论生产关系怎样落后于生产力的发展，——斯大林指出说——但它们迟早总应而且一定会去适合于生产力底发展水准，适合于生产力底性质。不然，便会有生产体系中生产力与生产关系统一底根本破坏，全部生产破裂，生产危机以及生产力破坏的情形。”（“列宁主义问题”，俄文版第五九二页；中文版第七二五页）生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一经济法则底本质，就简单而明了地表现在斯大林的这一原理上面了。
    在成熟的资本主义社会里面，生产关系与生产力性质底适合是已经被破坏了。从这里就产生了把资本主义引上不可避免的灭亡道路的经济危机和动荡。
    因现代的生产力和资本主义生产关系之间的冲突而产生的战争，使生产力遭到最大的破坏。经济危机给各国人民也带来了同样灾害。一九二九年到一九三三年的世界经济危机和继之而来的萧条给各国人民所带来的物质上的损失，等于一九一四年到一九一八年帝国主义战争所招致的损失。这样，资本主义就使人类陷入了流血战争和周期性的、毁灭性的危机底深渊。这原因便是在历史上已经过了时的资本主义生产关系。
    但是，如果资本主义的生产关系阻碍生产力的发展，那么为什么到现在它还不像生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则所要求的那样，为社会主义生产关系所代替呢？
    斯大林同志指出了与自然法则有所不同的、经济法则底如下特点：如果自然法则底发现与利用还能够比较顺利地进行的话，那么新的经济法则的发现与利用却要损害衰朽的反动社会势力底利益，从而遇到这一势力的最强烈的反抗。
    生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则的情形就正是如此。这一法则早已在资本主义国家当中为自己开辟着道路。但是极力想把资本主义永久保存下去的反动的帝国主义资产阶级却死命地对这一法则的作用加以反抗。
    因此，就需要有一个强大到可以摧毁这一反抗，并且为生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一经济法则底作用开辟道路的社会革命力量。

    由于伟大十月社会主义革命的结果，生产力和生产关系之间的冲突在苏联获得了解决；由于消灭了资本主义生产关系而代之以社会主义生产关系，生产关系与生产力的性质已经完全适合了。因而，生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则就获得了充分的发生作用的广阔场所。为生产关系一定要适合生产力这一经济法则开辟了发展道路的革命的社会力量，就是在列宁—斯大林的党领导下所产生的工人与农民的联盟。
    有一些经济学家认为，苏维埃政权仿佛已经消灭了那些老旧的经济法则，并代替这些旧的法则而制定、创造了新的经济法则。斯大林同志揭露了这些说法底错误的、唯心的性质。在描述苏维埃政权在消灭资本主义，在建立社会主义制度的事业上所起的伟大历史作用时，斯大林同志写道：
    “这个任务无疑是困难而复杂的，是没有先例的。然而，苏维埃政权光荣地完成了这个任务，但是，它之所以完成了这个任务，并不是因为它似乎消灭了现存的经济法则，‘制定’了新的经济法则，而仅仅是因为它依靠了生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则。以前我国的生产力，特别在工业中的生产力，是具有社会性的，但所有制的形式却是私人的，资本主义的。苏维埃政权依据生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则，把生产资料公有化了，使之成为全体人民的财产，因而消灭了剥削制度，创造了社会主义的经济形式。如果没有这个法则，不依靠这个法则，苏维埃政权是不能完成自己的任务的。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”中文本，人民出版社版，第五——六页）生产关系对于生产力性质的适合也存在于其他社会形态发展的上升阶段中。但是在苏联，这种适合是在社会主义生产关系的基础之上在历史上第一次被确定了；而社会主义的生产关系不单是为技术的发展，而且为最重要的生产力量——劳动者本身——开辟了无限广大的远景。
    生产关系对于生产力性质的适合在苏联的确立，保证了生产力发展底连续性，保证了社会主义生产增长底历史上空前的高速步调。与这一增长的同时，全体人民底物质与文化福利也在经常不断地提高着。
    社会主义的生产关系是社会主义社会生产力强大发展底主要的、具有决定性的力量。
    有一种看法认为生产关系对于生产力的发展仿佛只能起一种阻碍物底否定作用。斯大林同志就指出了这种看法底荒唐的、庸俗的、反马克思主义的性质。
    在地理条件、人口的增加、科学的发展、当作纯技术过程来看的生产力底“本身运动”等等上面来寻求生产力发展的主要根源的那些反马克思主义的观点，受到了斯大林同志的致命的打击。斯大林同志关于作为生产力底主要推进者的生产关系的论述，对于有使命来科学地阐明不同社会经济形态底灭亡和繁荣底原因的经济学家和历史学家有着重大的意义。生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则使我们的干部能够更深入地理解社会主义社会经济发展的过程，并且及时地采取因这一法则的要求而产生的各种必要措施。
    斯大林同志指出了那种把社会主义生产关系对于生产力性质的完全适合看成是一种凝固不动的、一次就永远规定了的东西这一观点底错误。
    “……‘完全适合’这种说法是不能在绝对的意义上来理解的。——斯大林同志写道——不能把这种说法理解为仿佛在社会主义制度下，决没有生产关系落后于生产力的增长的现象。生产力是生产中最活动、最革命的力量。这种力量，就在社会主义制度下，也无可争辩地是走在生产关系前面的。生产关系只是经过一些时候，才会被改造得适合于生产力的性质。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”中文本，人民出版社版，第四五——四六页）因而，就是在生产关系是最先进，而且反动社会势力也已不复存在的社会主义条件下，生产力和生产关系之间还是会产生矛盾的。但是，社会主义社会的特点就是在于，社会有计划并及时地解决了这里在生产方式中所发生的各种矛盾，而事情通常就不会到冲突的地步。但是要做到这一点，就需要有共产党底正确而有科学根据的政策；这政策的依据就是经济法则的知识，而特别是生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则底知识。
    因此斯大林同志就教导苏维埃的干部，要他们细心地研究各种经济过程，掌握经济法则并且为了共产主义建设的利益而自觉地利用这些法则。
    为了不做经济法则的奴隶，就应当认识这些法则，依据着这些法则而不是违反着这些法则来规定政策。斯大林的共产党政策底百战百胜的力量就是在于自觉而巧妙地利用经济的法则。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于拟定社会主义生产新的有力高涨的苏联发展五年计划的指示，就是依据着生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则，依据着社会主义的基本经济法则的。
    我党最伟大的优越性之一，向来是在于而且现时仍在于它依据着关于社会发展法则的马克思主义科学，能够预见事件的进程，并且不是毫无把握地，而是依据着客观经济法则的知识来规定自己的政策的。
    四
    在争取实现从社会主义向共产主义的逐渐过渡的斗争中，苏联共产党获得了像强力的探照灯一样地照亮了社会主义社会今后发展道路的斯大林的天才新作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，作为自己的思想武器。
    斯大林同志教导大家应当怎样为了共产主义建设的利益来应用客观的经济法则，特别是应当怎样在从社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡的阶段中自觉而巧妙地利用生产关系一定要适合生产力这一经济法则。
    “……领导机关的任务——斯大林同志写道——在于及时地看出日益增长的矛盾，并及时地采取办法，使生产关系适合于生产力的增长，来克服这种矛盾。这首先是与集体农庄集团所有制、商品流通这种经济现象有关的”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”中文本，人民出版社版，第六一页）。斯大林同志教导说，为了消灭正在发生的这些矛盾，必须要逐渐地把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，而逐渐地用产品交换制来代替商品流通。
    从社会主义所有制的两种形式，从两个社会主义的生产部门向统一的全民所有制、向统一的、无所不包的生产部门的这一过渡得以实现，应当是以有利于集体农庄，从而也有利于全社会的办法，来把集体农庄所有制形式提高到全民所有制的水平。共产主义与商品流通是不相容的，因此就必须要逐渐地实现从商品流通到产品交换的过渡。
    为了要完成这样的过渡，就需要大大地增加从城市输送到农村去的产品数量。因此，斯大林同志指出说，应当是无需特别急躁地，随着为农村所必需的工业制品的积累程度来实现从商品流通到产品交换的过渡。
    这样，我们就看到，生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则是在人类社会全部历史过程中间，在一切社会形态中间都起着作用的客观法则。这个法则是使人们理解已经过了时的社会制度底灭亡和新社会制度底发生与繁荣底历史不可避免性的关键。
    生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则使我们能够理解，为什么资本主义在经受着衰败，为什么现代资产阶级的社会思想，它的政治的和其他的制度带有如此反动的性质。从另一方面来说，这一法则又揭示了先进社会力量的增长与团结、伟大的现代先进社会思想、共产主义思想底最广泛的传播底历史必然性，揭示了它们的胜利底历史不可避免性。生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一法则，社会主义社会对于这一法则的自觉应用和巧妙利用，保证了向共产主义过渡时所必需的、生产力底强大发展。
    马克思第一次发现了生产关系适合于生产力的法则。斯大林同志的历史功绩就是在于，他在自己的天才著作中对于这一法则清晰而全面地作了理论上的论证，提供了这一法则的经典定义并且揭示了这一法则在工人阶级反对资本主义的斗争中的伟大意义。斯大林同志综括了伟大十月社会主义革命的经验，综括了社会主义社会的发生和发展，进而分析了在新的历史条件下这一法则所起的作用。
    斯大林同志在其所著“苏联社会主义经济问题”中揭发了资本主义底那些日益深刻的矛盾，对于帝国主义的全部思想体系，对于主观唯心论的资产阶级政治经济学和社会学，给与了摧毁性的打击。生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这一客观经济法则和其他经济法则，这就是决定资本主义底灭亡的法则。这些法则引起了资产阶级和资产阶级思想家的畏惧和恐怖。因此资产阶级就不承认这些法则的客观性和真实性。因此资产阶级也就仇视关于这些法则的马克思主义科学。资产阶级的思想家和资产阶级的仆从学者的使命就是要推翻马克思主义，就是要向资产阶级歌唱一些有关资本主义命运的多少可以给他们宽宽心的小调子。资产阶级也就因这种服务而把钱给他们。
    在我们的时代里，只有现代最先进的力量——工人阶级及其政党才切实地关心到为了整个社会的利益而来发现并自觉地利用社会发展底客观经济法则。
    工人阶级及其马克思主义政党就是在这些法则中汲取对于社会主义在全世界胜利的不可动摇的信念和力量底泉源。斯大林同志以自己的新的天才著作在思想上武装了现代的先进社会力量。他用依据着客观经济法则底利用的共产主义建设底科学纲领武装了我们的党。
    为斯大林同志的伟大天才创造性地发展了的、关于社会发展法则底客观性质的马克思列宁主义科学，是共产主义建设中可靠的、经过考验的武器。
