    Propaganda Work of the Second Branch of the Party Committee of Shenyang 321 Factory

    Editor's Note: This is a part of "Propaganda Work of the Second Branch of the Party Committee of the 321 Factory", a book by Huo Yuwu and Zeng Ren, published by Northeast People's Publishing House. The original text has been abridged and the wording has been modified with the authors' consent.

    The Second Branch of the Party Committee of Shenyang 321 Factory has 48 propagandists, including 13 cadres separated from production and 35 workers directly involved in production; 7 Party members, 24 League members, and 17 active elements among the masses. In addition to the 19 propagandists who directly manage the blackboard newspapers, broadcast loudspeakers, and literary creation, the others are scattered in various production teams. The propagandists are united around a group of activists, forming a strong propaganda force.

    Leading Propagandists to Focus on Central Work

    The Party Committee holds a propagandist conference every ten days or so to report to the propagandists on the current central work, and the propagandists introduce specific propaganda experiences. The branch holds a propagandist meeting every week to study the specific ideological situation in the workshop and the important articles in the Propagandist Manual.

    Branch Secretary Qi Hualu said: "Last year, our propaganda work progressed simultaneously with the central work; this year, our propaganda work has preceded the central work."

    Before the start of each central task, repeated discussions and deliberations are conducted among the backbone and active elements in the workshop through forms such as expanded meetings of the branch committee, branch meetings or Party group meetings, propagandist conferences, League member conferences, trade union group leader and production team leader meetings, and veteran technician symposiums. Then, through them, all forms of propaganda are used to concentrate on the central task and launch a vigorous propaganda campaign. For example, on April 20, the higher authorities assigned the task of launching an increase production and practice economy campaign, and on April 21, the branch held an expanded meeting of the branch committee, and on April 22, it held a propagandist training class (lasting three days, a total of six hours). Administrative, trade union, and Youth League branches also held various meetings to first implement the leadership's intentions among the active elements. When the leadership announced 54 key issues of increasing production and practicing economy in the workshop, they immediately used the "Tips Courtyard" (an organization in the workshop for summarizing and promoting advanced experience), red flag award-winning projects, blackboard newspapers, cartoons, drums, clapper talks, plays and other forms of publicity, focusing on publicity, making the increase production plan known to everyone. When the trade union officially called on all employees to take action and carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, 45 of the 54 "key points" were snapped up on the same day, forming a mass movement to find tips.

    In addition to timely arranging the work of propagandists and leading them to study, the branch also regularly convenes propagandists to report, checks the work of propagandists, and collects feedback from the masses. For example, on July 16, propagandist Zhang Bailu reported: "I publicized in our group that oily items are prone to fire and the method of handling oily cotton yarn. After group discussion, the responsibility system for oily cotton yarn management has been re-established." Gao Zhongyi reported: "Li Yuxiu in my group has objections to the new technical standards, and even if the machine breaks down, he won't repair it." The above-mentioned reflections are of great help to the branch in understanding the situation, improving the work of the workshop, and strengthening the connection between the Party and the masses.

    Oriented to Production, Grasp Ideological Problems

    After each person made a personal plan according to advanced experience, the branch conducted an inspection. As a result, it was found that the completion of personal plans was not good. Taking the ninth group as an example, only four of the 23 people in the group started to learn Zhang Xihe's advanced operation method.

    Why couldn't Zhang Xihe's advanced operation method be promoted?

    One reason is that Zhang Xihe's advanced experience was mistakenly summarized as "three diligences - diligent hands, diligent eyes, and diligent sampling"; as a result, those who learned were in a flurry of activity, unable to grasp the essentials, and could not learn it at all. Another reason is that many people in the group have various ideological problems and have not learned Zhang Xihe's advanced operation method at all. For example, Zhang Xihe's master thought this way: "Zhang Xihe is a disciple I taught. I complete the plan every month, but the quality is slightly worse, which is due to the poor machine. I am the master. When Zhang Xihe was promoted to technician, I gave him a good machine, which is why I can't keep up with his quality." Young worker Li Shiyu said: "My skills are no worse than Zhang Xihe's. Although I verbally admit to learning from Zhang Xihe, I really look down on him in my heart."

    The branch believes that these erroneous ideas not only hinder the development of their labor creativity, but also hinder the promotion of advanced experience. The Party must lead the masses to fight against various erroneous ideas about advanced experience, and improve the masses' class consciousness in the process, in order to universally promote advanced experience and successfully complete the state plan and the workshop's increase production and practice economy plan.

    In order to widely understand the specific ideological situation of the masses, the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League respectively arranged for Party members, League members, propagandists, and foremen to take time to conduct an inspection, and the heads of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League also specifically assigned people to have individual talks. In this way, the ideological situation of 109 people was collected within a week. After repeated research, it was found that 37 people were actively looking for tips and learning advanced experience, and 72 people had various incorrect understandings of learning advanced experience:

    1.  Believing that learning from others is embarrassing. Such as saying "If I learn from him, how can I teach apprentices?" "My 20 years of seniority is not as good as his one year as a technician!" "When I was operating the machine, he wasn't even wearing pants yet, what tips can I learn from him!" etc.;

    2.  Satisfied with their existing technology, unable to see the superiority of advanced experience. Saying things like: "I'm used to the old methods, learning new things from others is not smooth." "Every monk has his own chime, every person has his own technique, why learn his tricks." "The task is not finished yet, where is there time to learn other people's tricks." etc.;

    3.  Not understanding the great future of national development, believing that the universal promotion of advanced experience will affect their careers and lives. Such as: "Tips mean reducing people and producing more; if the workshop is mechanized, we will have to go home and starve." "Once the tips are promoted and the labor organization is changed, the work will be transferred." "Everyone learns the tips, and the quota will be increased." etc.;

    4.  Not caring about the interests of the country, thinking that whether or not to learn advanced experience is only a personal matter. Such as: "It doesn't matter if defective products are produced, a few are public anyway"; "Regardless of tips or not, if I can't pass the skill test, I won't do it." "Lathe, planer, milling machine, everywhere can eat; if you don't want me, I'll go somewhere else" etc.

    After studying the above situation, the branch determined that it should first summarize the advanced ideas of advanced figures, and enlighten the consciousness of the masses through the reports of advanced figures about their own advanced ideas, in order to improve everyone's class consciousness.

    Summarizing the Advanced Ideas of Advanced Figures and Implementing Typical Demonstrations

    In order to summarize the advanced ideas of advanced figures, the branch studied 24 advanced figures in production in the workshop, and selected four people with outstanding model deeds and representativeness to summarize their advanced ideas. These four people were 51-year-old worker Cao Jiqing, Youth League member Zhang Xihe, Communist Party member production team leader Lin Fanqi, and Chen Baochang, who created advanced experience in saving tools.

    Summarizing the advanced ideas of advanced figures is a detailed work. Initially, the historical situation of the four people, the various reactions of the masses to them, and their own characteristics were understood. Then, they had individual talks with them to inspire them to talk about the ideological situation of creating advanced experience.

    Cao Jiqing said: "My home is 13 li away from the factory. I always arrive at the factory half an hour early every morning, first check the machine, oil the machine well, and prepare the tools. When the work bell rings, I immediately start the car. I always abide by all the regulations of the factory, because I understand that only by abiding by labor discipline, technical operating procedures, and other regulations can I improve product quality. Therefore, I have not produced a defective product in half a year.

    "Why am I so devoted to the factory and actively working? Because I realized the close relationship between the personal interests of workers and the national interests and the close relationship between production and front-line combat. Improving product quality is my direct resistance to US aggression and aid Korea; producing a defective product is equivalent to reducing the strength of resisting US aggression and aid Korea. Only when the country is strong can the workers be happy.

    "But I didn't figure these things out all at once. In the past, people often said that workers are the masters of the factory. But for a long time I didn't understand. I thought: 'Violating labor discipline will be criticized, and producing defective products will also be criticized. What kind of master is this? Does being a master require being managed by others?' Slowly I thought again: 'After going home, I do all the things like carrying water, repairing pigsties, and plastering walls with great energy. Even if others do it for me, I'm always worried. Sometimes I clearly have closed the door, but I always look at it again before going to bed. Thinking of this, I can't help but ask myself: Am I really the master of this factory?' I figured out the truth of being the master, and being the master in the factory means working hard like at home.

    "I also won an award last year because of the good quality of the product. But at that time I thought that winning the award was due to good luck and the bonus was picked up for nothing. Because at that time I was thinking that I was old and would soon be unable to go to work, so I should think of opening a small shop to maintain my life. But I also saw that old workers are picked up and dropped off by cars this year, and the Party branch and the trade union have repeatedly asked me to go to the sanatorium for recuperation. And I saw that Lao Gao and Lao Luo in the factory have already received 30% of their labor insurance money, and I further understood that as long as the country is strong, nursing homes will definitely be realized. After the 'Three-Anti' movement, I further realized that the state property belongs to all the people and cannot be embezzled by anyone. So I no longer wanted to open a small shop and entrusted everything to the country.

    "It is precisely because I have gradually figured out these issues under the education of the Party that I can work consciously. Therefore, I was so sad that I couldn't sleep at night when I broke a workpiece that time. I'm not afraid of losing face, but because I caused losses to the country, because I didn't do the work of resisting US aggression and aid Korea that I should have done."

    When summarizing the advanced ideas of advanced figures, Zhang Xihe reported on the destruction of his family under the Japanese devils and the process of learning technology well in a short period of time, and expressed his determination to study and find tricks to improve quality. Lin Fanqi described why he came early and left late, strictly abiding by all the systems of the factory; why he didn't go home after handing over the shift to ensure product quality, but insisted on repairing the machine; and why he could carefully observe the operation of everyone in the group, help Ao Yuhou create advanced operation methods, and patiently persuade the whole group to learn advanced experience. Lin Fanqi said: "This is because I have experienced from actual life that the country's production has developed and the workers' lives have improved. This is because under the education of the Party, I understand that only when all laborers work actively can the country quickly industrialize and build socialism. I understand that the glorious task of Party members is to endure hardship first and enjoy happiness later; to do everything in their power and unite and educate the masses to do the work of the group well is to strive for the realization of communism."

    The branch organized a total of two ideological report conferences for advanced figures, and invited the factory director and the Party committee secretary to participate in the conferences. After the advanced figures reported, the branch secretary made a brief summary and called on everyone to compare their thoughts with the advanced figures. Because of careful preparation in advance, each conference only took 1 hour and 10 minutes.

    Before convening the conference, the branch convened Party members, League members, and propagandists to arrange for in-depth collection of the masses' reactions to the reports of advanced figures.

    Everyone Improved Their Class Consciousness

    What are the contents of the advanced ideas of Cao Jiqing, Zhang Xihe, Lin Fanqi and other four comrades? What does it tell everyone? First, they used their personal experience to explain the suffering suffered in the old society, and their high degree of hatred for imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism. They realized their responsibilities today, they must defend the happiness they have gained, and they must have the confidence to build a better future. Second, they used their personal experience to explain that the status of the working class has fundamentally changed, and they realized that their labor today is not only to maintain their personal lives but also to serve the entire working class and the new democratic motherland. Third, they know that the working class, as the leading class of the country, should work actively and innovate boldly to improve labor productivity, so that the motherland can quickly industrialize and create a happy life. Fourth, they realized the great development prospects of the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The era when workers were squeezed out of factories due to technological improvements is gone forever.

    Everyone who heard the reports of advanced figures improved their consciousness, checked their backward ideas, and universally improved their class consciousness. Yang Guishan said: "I have been working in the factory since 1951, and I have never been at ease with my work. I often said: Lathe, planer, milling machine, everywhere can eat, I am unwilling to learn advanced experience. After listening to Zhang Xihe's report, I realized that I was too backward. Tonight I will learn advanced experience, and remove personal interests, and strive to join the League." Fu Pingshan said: "I used to think that there were no tips to find. After our group selected Wang Shixiang's tips, I thought that even if it was clever, I still had to work eight hours, so I didn't learn. These two days after listening to the reports, I don't want to lag behind anymore." Liu Xueshan was moved to tears, crying and saying: "I produced so many defective products, I'm sorry to the country. Lao Cao was so sad that he couldn't even sleep after breaking a workpiece; as for me, in the past I made a profit from opening a pancake shop with Wang Jinsheng, so I have never been at ease with my work..."

    In order to make ideological comparison a powerful method of mass self-education, the branch decided to conduct ideological comparison in mutual aid groups, and select comrades who had deeply checked themselves and improved their class consciousness in the ideological comparison to conduct typical demonstrations in the groups. In this way, a movement of progressive promotion, everyone comparing with advanced ideas, and conscious universal self-education was formed.

    Advanced Experience Performance and Vivid Motivational Slogans

    After the technicians summarized the advanced experience from a technical and theoretical point of view, and the masses universally improved their class consciousness, the problem that remained was how to enable everyone to quickly master the advanced experience. At this time, the best way to promote advanced experience is for advanced figures to demonstrate their advanced operation methods.

    The branch systematically organized 24 advanced figures in the workshop to perform. For example, Cao Jiqing's performance, first explained while operating, asking everyone to watch and listen; then repeated the continuous and rapid operation, asking everyone to pay attention. After the performance, everyone immediately started a discussion, taking turns to try to learn, and appraising the degree to which each person learned and the shortcomings that existed, and finally making a personal learning plan.

    Through the performance, the masses fully saw the superiority of advanced experience and the key points of advanced experience. In the past, many people thought that the tips had been found and the potential had been tapped. The branch proposed: "Tips are smiling at you, see if you want them!" "Tips are everywhere, see if you move your hands!" "Tips are running all over the ground, see if you use your brain!"

    In order to encourage cooperation between technicians and workers, the branch proposed the slogan "Technicians use their brains to think, relying on the masses has strength."

    According to the problems existing in each group, the branch compiled clapper talks to encourage production. For example, the leader of the sixth group was busy with daily affairs and did not actively look for tips in the group. As a result, the group had tips, but he didn't know it. The propagandist of the branch wrote to them: "Comrades in the sixth group, look, your group has a lot of defective products; advanced experience is available, see if you move your hands". The two leaders of the eighth group looked down on each other, and even did not take responsibility when handing over the shift. The branch timely put forward opinions to them, and that night the two of them discussed improving the production problems of the whole group.

    Diverse Forms of Propaganda

    The Second Branch of the Party Committee also skillfully used the following forms of propaganda:

    The branch has two blackboard newspapers, which are edited by four propagandists. These four people are in contact with more than 30 correspondents, so the news is well-informed and the materials are authentic. For example, after the blackboard newspaper published a manuscript criticizing Liu Qiyan for producing 27 defective products in two months, the group to which Liu Qiyan belonged convened a group meeting to discuss ways to help him reduce defective products and was determined to improve quality.

    Broadcast loudspeakers timely encourage and urge the masses to produce. For example: "Group 20, your daily task is 58 pieces, but yesterday you only completed 40 pieces, 18 pieces short of the task. Attention! 18 pieces short of the task. Because you can't complete the task, the next two processes are already waiting for materials. Attention! The next two processes are already waiting for materials. You should step up your efforts to complete the task." In the evening, the activists of the group held a meeting to discuss ways to complete the task, and completed 47 pieces the next day, and 58 pieces the third day, and has maintained 63 pieces ever since.

    The literary group used the themes of the workshop to create three operas, 18 cross talks, and drums in the promotion of advanced experience, and performed them many times, which powerfully promoted the work of learning advanced experience and improving class consciousness in the workshop.

    The two propagandists in charge of cartoons. At the beginning of the increase production and practice economy campaign, 55 cartoons about the increase production and practice economy campaign were drawn to publicize the political and economic significance of increasing production and practicing economy.

    Adopt the propaganda method of red flag competition and tips blooming and bearing fruit. Wherever everyone in the workshop has accepted advanced experience and the tips have bloomed in the entire workshop, red flags and a red flower are inserted on everyone's machines. Whoever has made achievements in learning advanced experience and completed the personal advanced plan in one day will hang a green fruit under the red flag and the red flower. In order to improve collectivism, they set up a "Tips Fruiting Competition Garden" at the entrance of the workshop. The "Tips Tree" is set up in the garden according to the number of groups. Whenever an individual completes the plan and gets a red fruit in a week, a red fruit will also be produced on the tree of his group. When the trees in the group are full of red fruits, the whole group will be awarded.

    The branch regards each report of victory as a major event, and the branch secretary, the workshop director, the trade union chairman, and the Youth League branch secretary personally send red flags, green fruits, and red fruits. This propaganda that consolidates the existing achievements of the masses step by step and encourages the masses to move forward step by step has become a great driving force for promoting the popularization of advanced experience in the entire workshop.

    In addition, seize every event to conduct propaganda, such as the visit of the returning delegation of the Volunteer Army to the Second Workshop and the visit of foreign guests to the Second Workshop, the branch seized the opportunity to launch propaganda activities.

    Propaganda to the Homes of Employees

    After each person in the workshop wins an award, the trade union sends congratulatory letters to their family members, specifically explaining the tips that their husbands or children have created and the value of the tips. These congratulatory letters aroused great interest among the family members.

    In order to make the employees' families and the factory's increase production and practice economy campaign more closely linked, the trade union chairman personally visited the families of the award winners to solicit whether they would like cash or in-kind objects. The mass meeting to reward advanced producers was moved to the dormitory, and the literary group of the workshop performed programs. Most of these programs were compiled from real people and real events in the workshop.

    As a result, the employees' families were also attracted to the factory's increase production and practice economy campaign. For example, after Gao Guoqi won an award, his wife said: "You have to find more tips and study tips well to create wealth for the country. I guarantee to do a good job in housework and you don't have to worry about it."

    It is precisely because the Second Workshop has such a strong propaganda and education work of the Party that the workers' ideological awareness and production enthusiasm have been continuously improved. Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy campaign this year, the production index has risen rapidly, and in July, 113.28% of the state production plan was completed. 156.5% of the increase production and practice economy plan was completed. Therefore, the Second Workshop has become an advanced workshop in Northeast China.

### 沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作

    沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作
    编者按：这是东北人民出版社出版的霍遇吾、曾任合著的“三二一工厂第二车间党支部的宣传工作”一书的一部分。原文经作者同意作了一些删节和文字的修改。
    沈阳三二一工厂第二车间党支部共有宣传员四十八人，其中有脱离生产的干部十三人，直接生产的工人三十五人；党员七人，团员二十四人，群众积极分子十七人。宣传员中除直接掌握黑板报、广播筒、文艺创作的十九人外，其他则分别散布在各生产小组中。宣传员周围都团结了一批积极分子，形成了坚强的宣传力量。
    领导宣传员集中宣传中心工作
    党的委员会每十天左右召开一次宣传员大会，给宣传员报告当前的中心工作，并由宣传员介绍具体的宣传经验。支部每星期召开一次宣传员会议，研究车间的具体思想情况和学习宣传员手册的重要文章。
    支部书记齐华鲁同志说：“在去年，我们的宣传工作是和中心工作同时并进的；今年，我们的宣传工作已经走在中心工作的前面了。”
    每个中心工作开始之前，均分别通过支委扩大会、支部大会或党小组会、宣传员大会、团员大会、工会组长、生产组长会议、老技工座谈会等形式，在车间的骨干和积极分子中进行反复的讨论酝酿。接着就通过他们，利用一切宣传形式，集中在中心工作上，展开声势浩大的宣传。比如：四月二十日上级布置了展开增产节约运动，二十一日支部召开支委扩大会议，二十二日即举办宣传员训练班
    （连三天，共六小时）。行政、工会、青年团支部也分别召开了各种会议，首先在积极分子中贯彻领导意图。当领导上公布出本车间五十四个增产节约的关键问题时，马上就运用窍门大院（该车间总结推广先进经验的组织）、红旗有奖课题、黑板报、漫画、大鼓、快板、演剧等宣传形式，集中宣传，使增产计划人人皆知。当工会正式号召全体职工行动起来，开展增产节约运动时，五十四个“关键”当天就被抢去四十五个，形成了群众性的找窍门运动。
    支部除了及时地布置宣传员工作和领导宣传员学习外，还定期召集宣传员汇报，检查宣传员的工作，收集群众的反映。比如，七月十六日宣传员张柏禄汇报：“我在本组宣传了油性物品容易引起火灾和油绵纱的处理办法，经过小组讨论，已重新建立起油绵纱管理的责任制。”高忠义汇报：“我组李玉修对新技术标准有意见，甚至机器出了毛病也不修理。”上述这些反映，对支部了解情况改进车间工作加强党和群众的联系有很大帮助。
    面向生产，抓住思想问题
    在每个人按先进经验订出个人计划后，支部进行了检查。结果，发现完成个人计划的情况并不好。以第九组为例，全组二十三人中，开始学习张喜贺先进操作法的，却只有四个人。
    为什么张喜贺的先进操作法不能推广呢？
    一个原因是把张喜贺的先进经验错误地总结为
    “三勤——手勤、眼勤、抽验勤”；结果，学的人手忙脚乱，不得要领，总学不会。另一个原因是组内很多人存在着各种思想问题，根本没有学习张喜贺先进操作法。比如，张喜贺的师傅这样想：“张喜贺是我教出的徒弟。我月月完成计划，就是质量上稍差一点，那是机器不好的原故。我是当师傅的，张喜贺升技工的时候，我把好机器给他了，这才赶不上他的质量。”青年工人李世余说：“我的技术不比张喜贺差，我嘴上虽然承认学习张喜贺，心里可真瞧不起。”
    支部认为这些错误的思想，不但阻碍了他们的劳动创造性的发挥，同时也阻碍着先进经验的推广。党必须领导群众和对待先进经验的各种错误思想做斗争，并从中提高群众阶级觉悟，才能普遍地推广先进经验，胜利地完成国家计划和本车间增产节约计划。
    为了广泛地了解群众的具体思想情况，党、行政、工会、青年团分别布置党员、团员、宣传员、工长抽出时间作一次检查，同时党、行政、工会、青年团的负责人也具体分工找人个别谈话。这样，
    一个星期之内，收集到一百零九人的思想情况。经过反复研究，其中积极找窍门和学习先进经验的有三十七人，另有七十二人对学习先进经验存有各种不正确的认识：
    一、认为学习别人是自己丢人。如说“我若向他学，还怎么教徒弟呢？”“我二十年的工龄，还赶不上他一年的技工！”“我上机器的时候，他还没穿裤子呢，我学他什么窍门！”等等；
    二、满足自己已有的技术，看不见先进经验的优越性。说什么：“老办法干惯了，新学别人的不顺手。”“一个和尚一个磬，一个人一个手法，何必学他的窍门。”“任务还完不成呢，那有工夫学别人的窍门。”等等；
    三、不了解国家发展的远大前途，认为先进经验普遍推广会影响自己的职业和生活。如：“窍门就是减人，多出活；车间都机械化了，咱就得回家吃去。”“窍门一推广，劳动组织一改变，就要调动工作。”“人人都学会了窍门，就要提高定额了。”等等；
    四、不关心国家利益，认为学习先进经验与否仅是自己个人的事情。如：“出废品没关系，出几个也是公家的”；“不管窍门不窍门，考工考不上，我就不干了。”“车钳刨铣镟，到处都吃饭；如果不要我，就上别处去”等等。
    支部研究了上述情况后，确定应该先总结先进人物的先进思想，通过先进人物关于自己先进思想的报告，来启发群众的自觉，以提高每个人的阶级觉悟。
    总结先进人物的先进思想，实
    行典型示范
    为了总结先进人物的先进思想，支部研究了本车间二十四名生产上的先进人物，从中选出了模范事迹突出又具有代表性的四个人来总结他们的先进思想，这四个人是五十一岁的老工人曹吉庆、青年团员张喜贺，共产党员生产组长林繁琪和创造节省工具先进经验的陈宝长。
    总结先进人物的先进思想是件细致的工作。开始，了解了他们四个人的历史情况，群众对他们的各种反映，以及他们本人的特点。继之，和他们本人个别交谈，启发他们谈出创造先进经验的思想状况。
    曹吉庆说：“我家距厂十三里。我每天早晨都提前半点钟到厂，先检查机器，上好机器油，准备好工具，等上班铃一响，就马上开车了。我时刻遵守厂里的一切规定，因为我明白只有遵守劳动纪律、技术操作规程以及其他规定时，才能提高产品质量。所以，我半年没出一个废品。
    “为什么我这样一心以厂为家，积极劳动呢？因为我认识了工人的个人利益和国家利益后方生产和前方作战的密切关系。提高产品质量，就是我直接抗美援朝；出一个废品，就等于减少了抗美援朝的力量。只有国家富强了，工人才能幸福。
    “但是，并不是一下子我就把这些问题弄清楚的。过去，大家常说工人是工厂的主人。但，很长时期我弄不清楚。我想：‘违反劳动纪律要批评，出了废品还批评，这叫啥主人呢？难道当主人还要叫别人管吗？’慢慢的我又想到：‘回家以后，挑水、修猪圈、抹墙这些事我都干的挺有劲，即使别人给干了，自己还总不放心。有时明明已经关好了门，但我睡觉前总还是再看它一遍。想到这里，我不由的反问自己：我究竟是不是这个工厂的主人呢？’我弄清了当主人的道理，在工厂当主人就要和在自己家里一样好好劳动。
    “去年我也曾因为产品质量好得了奖。但，那时我认为得奖是碰上了好运，奖金是白拣来的。因为当时我正寻思着自己年老了，快上不成班啦，应该想法开个小铺维持生活。但，我又看见今年老工人上下班都有汽车接送，党支部和工会都曾几次请我去休养院休养。又见到本厂老高头和老骆头已经领到了百分之三十的劳保金，我就更进一步明白了只要国家富强了，养老院一定能实现。经过‘三反’，我更弄清了国家财产是属于全体人民的，任何人也私吞不了的。于是，我再也不想开小铺了，把一切都托付给国家了。
    “正因为我在党的教育下逐渐弄清楚了这些问题，我就能自觉的工作了。所以，那次撞坏一个活，我难过得半夜睡不着。我不是怕自己丢人，而是因为给国家造成了损失，是因为我没做好我应做的抗美援朝工作。”
    在总结先进人物先进思想时，张喜贺报告在日本鬼子侵占下的家破人亡的情况和短期内学好技术经过，并表示决心钻研出提高质量的窍门。林繁琪叙述他为什么要早来晚走、严守厂里的一切制度；为什么为保证产品质量，交班后也不回家，一直坚持把机器修好；为什么能细心观察全组每个人的操作，帮助敖玉厚创造先进操作法，并耐心说服全组学习先进经验的原由。林繁琪说：“这是因为我从实际生活中体验到：国家生产发展了，工人的生活也改善了。这因为在党的教育下，我明白了：只有全体劳动者积极劳动，国家才能很快工业化，才能很快建设社会主义。明白了党员的光荣任务就是吃苦在先，享福在后；尽自己的一切力量并团结教育群众把小组的工作做好，就是为共产主义的实现而奋斗。”
    支部一共组织了两次先进人物思想报告大会，大会上邀请厂长、党委书记参加。在先进人物报告后，由支部书记做了简要总结，并号召大家和先进人物对照思想。因为事先准备周密，每次大会仅用
    一点零十分钟。
    在召开大会之前，支部召开了党员、团员、宣传员会议，布置深入收集群众对先进人物报告的反映。
    人人提高了阶级觉悟
    曹吉庆、张喜贺、林繁琪等四位同志的先进思想包含着哪些内容呢？它向大家说明了什么呢？第一，他们用切身经验说明了在旧社会遭受的痛苦，以及他们对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的高度仇恨。他们认识了今天自己应尽的责任，必须保卫已得的幸福，必须具有建设更加美好的将来的信心。第二，他们用自己切身体验说明了工人阶级的地位已经根本变化了，认识了自己今天的劳动不仅是为了维持个人的生活而且是为整个工人阶级、为新民主主义的祖国服务了。第三，他们知道作为国家领导阶级的工人阶级应该积极劳动，大胆革新，以提高劳动生产率，使祖国迅速工业化，创造幸福的生活。第四，他们认识了在毛主席领导下的新中国的远大发展前途。过去因技术的改进而把工人挤出工厂的时代已经一去不复返了。
    每个人听到了先进人物的报告，提高了自觉性，检查了自己的落后思想，从而普遍地提高了阶级觉悟。杨贵山说：“我从一九五一年进厂，一直不安心工作，我常常讲：车、钳、刨、铣、镟，到处都吃饭，不愿学习先进经验。在听了张喜贺的报告后，我就看出自己太落后了，今天晚上就学习先进经验，并去掉个人利益，争取入团。”富平山说：“我过去认为没什么窍门可找，我们组选出了王世祥的窍门后，我认为再巧还不是得干八小时，因此，也就不学。这两天听了报告，再也不愿落后了。”刘学山感动的流下眼泪，哭不成声的说：“我出那么多废品，对不起国家。老曹头撞坏一个活，就难过得连觉也睡不好；我呢，过去和王金生合开煎饼铺得了利，就一直不安心做工……”
    为了使思想对照成为群众自我教育的有力方法，支部决定在互助小组进行思想对照，并选择在思想对照中深刻检查了自己、提高了阶级觉悟的同志，在小组典型示范。这样，形成了层层推动、人人和先进思想对照、自觉的普遍的自我教育运动。
    先进经验表演和生动的鼓动
    口号
    在技术人员从技术理论上总结了先进经验，和群众普遍提高了阶级觉悟后，存在的问题就是如何使每个人都能迅速的掌握先进经验。这时，宣传先进经验最好的办法，就是由先进人物表演自己的先进操作法。
    支部有计划地组织本车间二十四个先进人物进行表演。比如，曹吉庆的表演，先是一面解说一面操作，叫大家一边看一边听；接着再来一遍连续快速操作，叫大家注意看。表演后，大家即展开讨论，轮流试学，并鉴定出每个人学到的程度，存在的缺点，最后订出个人学习计划。
    经过表演，群众充分看到了先进经验的优越性和先进经验的要领。过去很多人认为窍门找完了、潜力挖光了。支部则提出：“窍门朝你笑，看你要不要！”“窍门到处有，看你动手不动手！”“窍门满地跑，看你动脑不动脑！”
    为鼓励技术人员和工人合作，支部提出了“技术人员动脑想，依靠群众有力量”的口号。
    支部根据各组存在的问题，编成快板鼓励生产，如第六组组长忙于日常事务，不积极找本组的窍门，因之，该组出现了窍门，还不知道。支部宣传员就给他们写着：“六组工友你们瞧，你组废品真不少；先进经验本来有，看你动手不动手”。第八组的两个组长谁也瞧不起谁，甚至交班时互不负责，支部及时地向他们提出意见，当天晚上他们两个人就商量改进全组的生产问题。
    多种多样的宣传形式
    第二车间党支部还巧妙地运用了如下的宣传形式：
    支部一共有两块黑板报，由四个宣传员负责编辑，他们四个人联系了三十多个通讯员，所以消息灵通，材料真实。比如，黑板报登出批评刘起炎两个月内出了二十七个废品的稿子后，刘起炎所在的小组就召开了小组会，讨论帮助他减少废品的办法；决心提高质量。
    广播筒及时地鼓励和督促群众生产。比如：“第二十组，你们每天的任务是五十八件，昨天你们才完成了四十件，还差十八件，没完成任务。注意！还差十八件。因为你们完不成任务，下两道工序已经待料。注意！下两道工序已经待料。你们应加紧努力完成任务”。晚间，该组积极分子就开会讨论完成任务的办法，第二天完成四十七件，第三天就完成五十八件，至今一直保持六十三件。
    文艺组在推广先进经验中，用本车间的题材，创作了三个歌剧、十八段相声、大鼓，多次演出，有力地推动了本车间学习先进经验、提高阶级觉悟的工作。
    负责漫画的是两个宣传员。在增产节约一开始，就画出五十五幅关于增产节约运动的漫画，宣传增产节约的政治、经济意义。
    采用红旗竞赛和窍门开花结果的宣传方式。凡是全车间每个人都接受了先进经验，窍门已在全车间开花的，那末，就在每个人的机器上都插起红旗和一朵红花。凡是学习先进经验有成绩，并在一天中完成了个人先进计划的，就在红旗和红花下挂一青果。为了提高集体主义精神，他们在车间门口设立了“窍门结果比赛园”。园里按小组数目设起“窍门树”，凡个人在一周内完成计划得到红果时，在他本组的树上也结一红果。小组满树红时都给全组发奖。
    支部把每次的报捷都当做大事，由支部书记、车间主任、工会主席、青年团支书亲自送去红旗、青果、红果。这种步步巩固群众既有成绩，又步步鼓舞群众向前的宣传，成了推动全车间推广先进经验的极大动力。
    此外，抓紧每个事例进行宣传，如志愿军归国代表团访问二车间以及外地客人来二车间参观，支部都抓紧时机展开宣传活动。
    宣传到职工家里去
    车间每个人得奖后，工会都给本人家属送贺信，向家属具体说明他们的丈夫或子女创造出的窍门，以及该项窍门的价值。这些贺信引起了家属的巨大兴趣。
    为使职工家属和工厂的增产节约运动更密切的联系起来，工会主席亲自访问得奖者的家属，征询他们愿意要现金呢，还是要实物。把奖励先进生产者的群众大会移到宿舍召开，由本车间文艺组演出节目。这些节目绝大多数是用本车间的真人实事编成的。
    这样做的结果，就把职工家属也吸引到工厂的增产节约运动中来了。比如，高国启得奖后，他的妻子说：“你还要多找窍门，好好学习窍门，给国家创造财富，我保证做好家事，不用你挂心。”
    正是由于第二车间有了党的这样强有力的宣传教育工作，工人思想觉悟和生产积极性不断提高，今年开展增产节约运动以来生产指数迅速上升，七月份完成国家生产计划的百分之一一三点二八。完成了增产节约计划的百分之一五六点五。从而第二车间成为东北一个先进的车间。
