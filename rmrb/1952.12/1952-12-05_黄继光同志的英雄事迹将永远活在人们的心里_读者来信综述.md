    ——Summary of Readers' Letters

    After the publication of the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army combat hero and Communist Youth League member in the style of Matrosov, who bravely blocked the enemy's pillbox gun hole with his body, many readers wrote to the editorial department of this newspaper, expressing their condolences, praise, and love for this heroic figure. Hou Xilong from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote: Comrade Huang Jiguang's heroic deeds deeply moved me. This lofty spirit of internationalism and patriotism has a tremendous inspiring effect on the people of the whole country who are about to carry out large-scale economic construction. We must devote ourselves to the peaceful construction of the motherland with Comrade Huang Jiguang's selfless spirit of sacrifice, so that the industry of New China can develop rapidly, and the security of the motherland and world peace will have a more solid guarantee. A letter from the Planning Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, signed by thirty-two people, stated: The noble qualities and lofty revolutionary heroism displayed by Comrade Huang Jiguang in the struggle against the enemy have given us great education and strength. We are determined to do our best to improve work efficiency in the ongoing production increase and economy movement in the cooperative system, better serve the members, and welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction.

    Comrade Huang Jiguang's heroic deeds have even more shaken the hearts of millions of young people. Shi Bingtang from Beijing Heavy Industry School wrote: "Comrade Matrosov sacrificed himself, but his fearless spirit will forever inspire those standing on the front lines against aggression; Comrade Huang Jiguang sacrificed himself, and his immortal deeds will similarly become a force to inspire us to move forward. Their heroic acts, although not occurring at the same time and place, nor in the same war, were all for the purpose of opposing imperialist aggression, for the happiness of mankind, and for lasting world peace. Comrade Huang Jiguang's immortal deeds will forever live in people's hearts!" Jin Fuliang from the Central University of Finance and Economics wrote: "Comrade Huang Jiguang's heroic sacrifice made me unable to help but shed tears, but it also made me more determined.

We must learn from your spirit, excellently complete our learning tasks, and build the motherland, build the motherland's strong national defense!
