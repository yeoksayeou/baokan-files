    Nationwide Farmers Launch Patriotic Grain Delivery Campaign

    This autumn, agricultural production has generally seen good harvests across the country, and farmers everywhere are delivering patriotic grain with joyous hearts. "Dry and clean, stored separately, ready to deliver patriotic grain on time" has become a common slogan for hundreds of millions of farmers nationwide. The farmers' grain delivery campaign, which began in early November, has become a large-scale mass movement. In the Central-South and Southwest regions, farmers in most provinces began delivering grain at the end of October; in North China, East China, and Northwest China, grain began to be stored in warehouses in early November; in the Northeast region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where the autumn harvest was later, the farmers' grain delivery campaign has also begun.

    During this autumn grain collection, local people's governments generally paid attention to implementing the policy of "conducting land surveys to determine production, calculating levies according to rates, legally reducing or exempting taxes, and absolutely no additional levies." Before the autumn grain collection, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Measures for Reducing or Exempting Agricultural Taxes for Disaster-stricken Farmers," and major administrative regions and some provinces also stipulated specific measures to reduce the burden on farmers in old revolutionary base areas and to take care of the burdens of families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed. In implementing this policy, most counties in Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces adopted the method of "dividing areas to assess the disaster situation and calculating reductions and exemptions on a household basis." Some areas experienced erroneous tendencies such as "average reductions and exemptions" and "contracted reductions and exemptions," which were mostly corrected in a timely manner or are being corrected. Because most areas conducted land surveys to determine production or adjusted production before the autumn grain collection, further verifying the land area and production, the policy of "calculating levies according to rates" was better implemented, so the burden on farmers was relatively balanced and reasonable.

    全国各地农民展开缴纳爱国公粮运动
    今年秋季，各地农产品普遍丰收，各地农民正以欢欣的心情缴纳爱国公粮。“晒干扬净，单存单放，准备按时缴纳爱国公粮”，已成为全国亿万农民普遍的口号。农民缴粮运动在十一月初开始后，就形成一个大规模群众运动。中南区、西南区大部分省份的农民在十月底就已开始缴纳公粮；华北、华东、西北等区的公粮，十一月初开始入库；东北区和内蒙古自治区秋收较晚，农民缴粮运动也已开始。
    今年秋征中，各地人民政府一般地都注意贯彻“查田定产，依率计征，依法减免，决不附加”的方针。在秋征以前，中央人民政府政务院又颁布了“受灾农户农业税减免办法”，各大行政区和某些省并规定了减轻老根据地农民负担及照顾烈属、军属、孤寡老弱等户负担的具体办法。在贯彻此项政策中，湖北、山西、山东等省大部分县份采用了“划片评定灾情，按户计算减免”办法，某些地区曾发生“平均减免”和“减免包干”的错误倾向，大都及时得到纠正或正在纠正。大部分地区由于秋征前都进行了不同规模的查田定产或调整产量工作，进一步查实了田亩和产量，“依率计征”政策贯彻的较好，因此农民负担比较平衡合理。
