Xinhua News Agency report: Just as the United Nations was discussing the Tunisian issue, the French colonialists brutally assassinated Achour, Secretary-General of the Tunisian Workers' Union and leader of the Tunisian nationalist Neo-Destour party. Afterwards, the Tunisian Governor-General de Hauteclocque immediately flew back to Tunisia from Paris to arrange new suppressions. This approach by the French colonial authorities was clearly carefully planned, with the aim of diverting public attention from French colonial rule while the United Nations was discussing the Tunisian issue, cracking down on the Tunisian national independence movement, and undermining the unity of the Tunisian people.

However, this conspiracy of the French colonial authorities went bankrupt.

Salah Ben Youssef, the representative of the Tunisian people, held a press conference at the United Nations headquarters. He said: This assassination was carried out by the French terrorist organization "Red Hand." Youssef produced leaflets distributed by "Red Hand" calling for the killing of Achour as proof and pointed out that well-known French bourgeois parties and French newspapers in Tunisia openly demanded that the Tunisian nationalist leader be executed immediately.

The Tunisian people responded to the French colonialists by strengthening their struggle. Workers from the Tunisian Workers' Union and the General Union of Tunisian Workers united and, starting on the evening of the 5th, held a three-day general strike to protest the assassination of Achour. Shops in the Arab quarter of Tunis were closed, and all commercial activity came to a complete standstill. A protest demonstration of more than two thousand people was also held in Tunis.

    法国殖民者残杀突尼斯工会领袖
    突尼斯工人罢工抗议
    据新华社讯：正当联合国讨论突尼斯问题的时候，法国殖民者残暴地暗杀了突尼斯工人联合会总书记、突尼斯民族主义的新独立党领袖阿歇德。事后，突尼斯总督德奥特喀洛克马上从巴黎乘飞机返回突尼斯，布置新的镇压。法国殖民当局这一套做法显然是经过详细策划的，其目的就是要在联合国讨论突尼斯问题时，转移公众对法国殖民统治的注意，打击突尼斯民族的独立运动并破坏突尼斯人民的团结。
    但是，法国殖民当局的这一阴谋破产了。
    突尼斯人民代表萨拉·本·犹赛夫在联合国总部举行记者招待会。他说：这次暗杀是法国恐怖组织“血掌”进行的。犹赛夫拿出“血掌”所散发的号召杀害阿歇德的传单作为证明并且指出：法国著名的资产阶级政党以及在突尼斯的法国报纸都公开要求把突尼斯民族主义领袖立即处死。
    突尼斯人民以加强斗争来回答法国殖民者。参加突尼斯工人联合会和突尼斯工人工会的工人团结在一起，从五日晚上开始，举行为期三天的总罢工，抗议暗杀阿歇德。突尼斯市阿拉伯人区的商店都关上了门，一切商业活动完全停止。突尼斯市还举行了两千多人的抗议示威。
