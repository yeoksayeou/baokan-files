    The Dishonest and Deceptive Practices of Certain Private Magazine Distributors Should Be Corrected
    ——A Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, we have continuously received letters from readers exposing the dishonest and deceptive practices of private magazine distributors who fail to deliver books and periodicals after receiving payment.
    A letter from the Xi'an Dahua Staff and Workers' Spare-time School states that they pre-ordered ten kinds of periodicals, including "People's Education," from the "Beijing Liberation Books and Magazines Supply Agency" in early April of this year. The agency only haphazardly sent eleven copies of seven magazines and then stopped sending them. Liu Ling from Tsinghua University wrote that Beijing's "Lianxin Bookstore" sent people to a midwifery hospital in late August of this year to solicit magazine subscriptions and promote books. The hospital pre-ordered one copy each of "Popular Medicine" and "Maternal and Child Health" for six months, as well as the first volume of "Political Common Sense Reader," and other books. Until now, none of these magazines and books have been sent. Despite repeated letters of inquiry from readers, there has been no response. Gu Jixian from Yuci, Shanxi, wrote that in July, a certain Yang who claimed to be from the "Beijing Federation of Trade Unions" came to their factory to promote books and magazines. Comrades subscribed to several magazines from him, all for a term of six months. He issued order forms with the letterhead of the "Federation of Trade Unions" and provided the address and telephone number. However, four months have passed, and not a single magazine has been delivered, and there has been no response to letters. Finally, after investigation, it was learned that there is no such "Federation of Trade Unions" in Beijing, nor is there that telephone number.
    In this batch of letters, readers exposed a total of six similar magazine distribution agencies (in addition to the above three, there are also the Capital Publishing House, China Magazine Mobile Supply Agency, and the Northwest Branch of the Xinmin Books and Magazines Agency), affecting areas throughout North China, East China, Central South China, and Northwest China, with many people suffering losses as a result. The readers' letters unanimously pointed out that these distribution agencies not only lack the spirit of serving the people and cherishing the people's publishing and distribution undertakings, but some are obviously engaged in planned extortion from the people. They request that the Industry and Commerce Bureaus, the news and publishing leading organs, and public security departments of various local people's governments pay attention to this and conduct inspections and take appropriate action.

    应纠正某些私营杂志发行所
    不守信用和欺骗群众的行为
    ——读者来信综述
    近来我们不断接到读者来信，检举私营杂志发行所，收款后不发书刊的不守信用和欺骗行为。
    西安大华职工业余学校来信说，他们在今年四月初，向“北京解放图书杂志供应社”预订“人民教育”等期刊十种。该社仅凌乱地给了七种杂志共十一册，就不再寄了。清华大学刘玲来信说：北京“联信书店”于今年八月下旬派人到一所助产医院征求杂志订户，并推销书籍。该院预订了半年“大众医学”、“妇婴卫生”各一份，及“政治常识读本”上册等书。直到现在，这些杂志和书籍都没有发去。虽经读者再三去信催问，仍无下文。山西榆次顾继贤来信说：七月间有一个自称“北京工联社”的杨某，到他们工厂推销书报杂志。同志们向他订了几种杂志，期限都是半年。他开了“工联社”的订单，并说明了地址和电话号码。但至今四个月了，杂志一份也没送去，去信也没有消息。最后经调查了解，才知道北京根本没有这个“工联社”，也没有那个电话号码。
    在这批信件中，读者检举了类似杂志发行所共六家（除以上三家外，还有首都出版社，中国杂志流动供应社，新民书报杂志社西北分社等三家），影响地区遍及华北、华东、中南、西北，群众因此而蒙受损失者甚多。读者来信一致指出：这些发行机构不但没有为人民服务和爱护人民出版发行事业的精神，有的显然是有计划地向人民进行敲诈。他们要求各地人民政府工商局、新闻出版领导机关和公安部门加以注意，并作检查处理。
