(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 23) We have now obtained witness testimony proving that the 38,000 POWs handed over by the US to the Lee Seung-man gang under the guise of "release" this year were later forced to serve in the Lee Seung-man puppet army and sent to the front lines as cannon fodder.

On November 6th, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured two soldiers of the Lee Seung-man puppet army, Kim Sung-tae and Cha Geun-soo. As a result of the interrogation, these two were originally captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who had been "released" by the US. They told us the truth about the so-called "release" and the process of being forced to serve in the Lee Seung-man puppet army.

Kim Sung-tae, from Seoul, joined the Korean People's Army on July 2, 1950, after the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul. On October 23 of the same year, he was captured by the puppet security forces when the Korean People's Army withdrew and was detained in POW camp No. 64 on Geoje Island (numbered 94990). Cha Geun-soo, from Seoul, joined the Korean People's Army on July 7, 1950, and was captured by the Lee puppet army on September 28 of the same year and detained in POW camp No. 65 on Geoje Island (numbered 16584).

After Kim Sung-tae and Cha Geun-soo were captured by the US, they began a subhuman life of beatings and torture. According to Kim Sung-tae, bloody massacres were endless in the POW camp. For example, in June 1951, the US and Lee armies entered the camp, attempting to remove the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the camp. When our captured personnel refused, they used rifles and grenades to attack the unarmed POWs. This time, POWs Kim Heung-gu, Jung Bong-woon, and 33 others were killed or injured on the spot.

In addition to bloody massacres, the US side also created so-called "voluntary repatriation" and carried out extremely sinister deception against our captured personnel. According to Kim Sung-tae and Cha Geun-soo, in February of this year, the US POW camp authorities announced that everyone should write a blood letter requesting "voluntary repatriation," and then gathered all those who "requested voluntary repatriation" and asked them to express their attitude. When our captured personnel all expressed their willingness to return to North Korea, the US then announced: those who want to return to North Korea should gather outside the gate. As soon as our captured personnel reached the gate, they were beaten by guards who had been arranged in advance; the rest of the people hesitated when they saw this situation. At this time, the person in charge of the US POW camp announced that any POW who did not want to go out of the gate did not want to return to North Korea. The US used such shameless means to forcibly detain POWs.

Then the US began a series of fake releases and forced them to join the Lee puppet army. Kim Sung-tae said that in June of this year, the US transported this group of so-called "unwilling to return to North Korea" POWs in batches. Kim Sung-tae was in the sixteenth batch, and Cha Geun-soo was in the second batch. Before the "release," a captain surnamed Choi led them to participate in a pre-arranged meeting. At the meeting, the mayor of Seoul spoke to them, asking them to join the Lee puppet army, and forcing them to publicly express their determination to be loyal to the Lee Seung-man puppet government and resolutely join the Lee puppet army to "eliminate communism and save the country." The US also asked them to register at the police station before they were allowed to go home. Afterwards, the steps to force them to join the Lee puppet army became more and more intensified. The police repeatedly went to their homes to investigate and threaten them, and soon issued a second national registration certificate, ordering them to register within two weeks, otherwise they would be treated as deserters. Under such threats and coercion, Kim Sung-tae and Cha Geun-soo believed that there was no way out except to be Lee's puppet army, but in order to avoid becoming combat soldiers, they went to the "labor service office" to register. However, under the planned arrangement of the US, they could not escape the trap that had been arranged for them long ago. The so-called "labor service office" was precisely the agency for collecting cannon fodder for the Lee puppet army. Kim Sung-tae and Cha Geun-soo were sent from the "labor service office" to the Intelligence Department of the Lee puppet army headquarters for short-term special agent training, and then sent to the front.

The facts told by Kim Sung-tae and Cha Geun-soo thoroughly expose the shameless trick of the US side to forcibly classify POWs as "civilians" and force them to join the Lee Seung-man puppet army in the name of so-called "release." It fully shows that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" manufactured by the US under the banner of "humanitarianism" is a brutal obliteration of the free will of POWs, forcing them to accept the fate of being enslaved.

### 我方获得美方强迫战俘充当炮灰的人证

    我方获得美方强迫战俘充当炮灰的人证
    【新华社开城二十三日电】我方现在已经获得人证，证明美方在今年以“释放”为名移交给李承晚匪帮的三万八千名战俘，后来都被迫充当了李承晚伪军，开上前线充当炮灰。
    十一月六日，中国人民志愿军某部俘获了李承晚伪军的士兵金星泰、车根洙两人。讯问的结果，这两人原来都是被美方“释放”的朝鲜人民军的被俘人员。他们向我方讲述了所谓“释放”的真相和被迫充当李承晚伪军的经过。
    金星泰，汉城人，一九五○年七月二日朝鲜人民军解放汉城后参加朝鲜人民军。同年十月二十三日朝鲜人民军撤退时为伪治安队俘虏，被拘禁在巨济岛六十四号战俘营中（编号为九四九九○）。车根洙，汉城人，一九五○年七月七日参加朝鲜人民军，同年九月二十八日被李伪军俘虏，被拘禁在巨济岛六十五号战俘营（编号为一六五八四）。
    金星泰和车根洙被美方俘获以后，便开始了受毒打拷问的非人生活。据金星泰说，战俘营中的血腥屠杀是层出不穷的。例如，一九五一年六月间，美李军开入营场，企图把营场中的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗摘下，遭到我方被俘人员的拒绝，他们就用步枪、手榴弹向手无寸铁的战俘进攻，这一次当场就打死打伤战俘金兴九、郑凤云等三十五人。
    除了血腥屠杀外，美方更制造所谓“自愿遣返”，对我方被俘人员进行了极其险恶的欺骗。据金星泰、车根洙两人说，今年二月间，美方战俘营当局宣布要大家写血书要求“自愿遣返”，然后把所有“要求自愿遣返”的人召集起来，要他们表示态度。当我方被俘人员都表示愿回北朝鲜时，美方便宣布：愿回北朝鲜的去大门外集合。我方被俘人员刚走到大门口，就遭到事先布置好的警卫的毒打；其余的人见到这种情况，犹豫不前，这时美方战俘营负责人就宣布，凡是不愿出大门的战俘，就是不愿回北朝鲜的。美方就用这种无耻的手段来强迫扣留战俘。
    然后美方开始了一系列的假释放和强迫他们参加李伪军的步骤。金星泰说，今年六月间，美方把这批所谓“不愿回北朝鲜”的战俘分批运走。金星泰和车根洙两人被送到永川收容所。
    从今年六月三十日起，美方便开始了他们的假释放。据金星泰、车根洙两人说，这次被“释放”的战俘分十七批，共二万七千多名。金星泰在第十六批，车根洙在第二批。在“释放”之前，由一位姓崔的大队长带领他们参加了一个事先布置好的会议。会上有汉城市长向他们讲话，要他们参加李伪军，并强迫他们当众表示决心为李承晚傀儡政府效忠，坚决参加李伪军“灭共救国”。美方并要他们到警察署登记，然后才准回家。以后，强迫他们参加李伪军的步骤就一步一步加紧了。警察三番五次地到他们家里去调查威胁，不久又发下第二国民登记证，限令在两星期内登记，否则就以逃兵对待。在这样威胁逼迫之下，金星泰和车根洙认为除了当李伪军以外，无路可走，但为了避免当战斗兵，他们便到“劳务处”去登记。但在美方有计划布置之下，他们怎么也逃不出早替他们安排好了的圈套。所谓“劳务处”正是替李伪军搜罗炮灰的机构。金星泰和车根洙就这样由“劳务处”送到李伪军陆军本部情报部受短期特务训练后，又被送上前方了。
    金星泰、车根洙两人所讲的事实，彻底揭穿了美方硬将战俘列为“平民”，用所谓“释放”名义强迫他们参加李承晚伪军的无耻把戏。它充分说明美方在“人道主义”招牌下制造的所谓“自愿遣返”，就是惨无人道地抹杀战俘的自由意志，强迫他们接受被奴役的命运。
