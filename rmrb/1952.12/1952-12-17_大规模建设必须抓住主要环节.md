Large-Scale Construction Must Grasp the Main Links

    Due to the restoration and development of our country's economy, especially industrial production, the completion of various social reforms, the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the increase in national defense strength, our country is basically equipped with the conditions for carrying out large-scale construction.

    The scale of our future construction undertakings, the complexity and arduousness of the tasks, will be unprecedented in the history of our country. Only by concentrating the efforts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country can we effectively and quickly complete the task of large-scale national construction.

    Our country's large-scale construction cause must grasp the main links and concentrate its strength to carry out. The main goal of our current construction is to develop our country's industry; in the development of industry, we must first focus on the development of the industries that produce means of production, that is, heavy industry—the development of metallurgy, fuel, machinery, and electricity. Because only the development of heavy industry can guarantee the consolidation of national defense, drive the comprehensive development of the national economy, and lay a reliable foundation for the steady realization of national industrialization. This principle is easy to understand, and it seems that no one holds any different opinions, but does this mean that this policy has been implemented in all our actual work? Or that everyone has clearly recognized it in their minds?

    The fact is not so. In our basic construction work, the phenomenon of "grabbing everything at once" and the local viewpoint that disregards the overall situation still exist seriously. Some comrades are overly enthusiastic, hoping to get all the good things done at once, and trying to start all kinds of construction at once; also, some comrades do not consider the country's overall construction plan, but only proceed from local needs, asking the state to allocate more funds or manpower to them, and are unwilling to transfer cadres from their regions and departments to other more important areas. The subjective wishes of these comrades may all be good, but the result is often messing things up, causing undue losses to the country's construction cause. Because there are many places in our country that need to be built, there are millions of projects that need to be carried out, and from a local point of view, every project is urgently needed and beneficial to the country and the people. Precisely because of this, some comrades forget the overall situation and cannot maintain a clear head, and cannot distinguish the priorities in large-scale construction. Such comrades do not understand, or do not truly understand, that dispersing our funds and manpower without distinguishing priorities is actually weakening the country's construction strength and delaying the speed of national industrialization. This is an error of the same nature as "dividing troops to defend every pass" in the military. We should realize that today's construction in our country is not only based on heavy industry, but also in the construction of heavy industry, we should distinguish between major and minor projects, between urgent and non-urgent projects, and between basic and auxiliary projects. There must be no confusion or inversion of priorities. We must concentrate sufficient funds and manpower to ensure the construction of the most urgently needed important projects in the country. This is not only because such projects are of paramount importance to the speed of industrialization in our country, but also because it must be done according to the current subjective strength and various conditions of our country. Our country is still engaged in the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Although we have done everything possible to increase the fund for industrial basic construction, it is still insufficient compared to the construction needs of our country. Therefore, we must concentrate our limited funds on the urgent needs, on key projects that are of great significance to the development of the national economy. Furthermore, in terms of our construction capabilities, whether it is geological exploration, design, or construction, it is still far behind the objective needs. Therefore, in addition to rapidly strengthening these forces, we can currently only concentrate our limited manpower on the urgent needs, on key projects that are of great significance to the development of the national economy.

    It can be seen that concentrating strength on the construction of heavy industry, especially concentrating strength on the construction of important projects that can accelerate the speed of national industrialization, is the policy that must be adopted and the principle that must be observed in our country's large-scale construction. It can be seen that the idea of ​​starting everything at once, the view that mistakenly understands the country's large-scale construction as everything should be large-scale and everywhere should be large-scale, is extremely harmful to the current national construction cause and must be prevented and opposed. It can be seen that implementing the idea of ​​grasping the main links into all basic construction work is the most important task of the Party, the government, and the economic leadership departments.

    It is in this sense, in the sense that our country needs to expand the heavy industry base, especially must grasp the construction of important projects, that we must raise basic construction to the primary position in economic construction work.

    Putting the basic construction of industry in the primary position requires party committees and governments at all levels, as well as economic leadership departments, to constantly focus their leadership on the basic construction of industry, especially key projects, to timely study and solve the problems therein, to summarize and promote successful experiences, and to combat all undesirable tendencies that deviate from this policy. Putting the basic construction of industry in the primary position requires organizing a strong basic construction team, drawing outstanding cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and experienced workers from all aspects, especially from industrial production departments, to participate in this work, so as to strengthen the basic construction institutions, expand the strength of geological exploration, design, and construction, and improve political work, thereby ensuring the completion of important projects on schedule, and at the same time vigorously preparing the reserve forces for basic construction. Putting the basic construction of industry in the primary position also requires the cooperation of relevant departments—transportation departments, labor departments, local industrial departments, trade departments, financial departments, scientific research departments, and urban construction departments—especially the cooperation with important projects, to vigorously assist the basic construction departments to ensure the smooth resolution of difficulties in transportation, building materials, and labor. Only in this way can we put basic construction in the primary position in practice rather than in words, so as not to turn the correct slogan into empty talk.

    Putting the basic construction of industry in the primary position requires making full preparations for the important projects of basic construction. Whether there are preparations and how well they are prepared are the specific standards for measuring whether we have truly put basic construction in the primary position.

    In order to do a good job in basic construction, what preparations should our industrial and other leadership departments make?

    First, we must correctly formulate the basic construction plan. A practical plan must specifically stipulate the focus of construction of each year in this department according to the country's overall construction policies and plans—proportion, scale, and sequence—rather than a simple comprehensive summary of the requirements of each subordinate unit. The basic construction plan must be carefully reviewed at each level. Our plan should neither deviate from the current subjective strength and conditions, so as to run too far and make the plan detached from reality; nor should it ignore all the potential capabilities under our national system, so as to be self-satisfied and make the plan fall behind the development of the entire cause. At present, we must focus on opposing the conservative ideas that do not actively tap potential strength and do not take effective measures to strengthen our own construction strength.

    Second, effectively collect and study relevant basic construction data, concentrate strength on conducting geological exploration work for important projects, and prepare accurate materials for design. The size of the geological exploration force is one of the prerequisites for determining whether our basic construction can be accelerated and carried out correctly, and it is also the weakest link in our basic construction force. If we rely on the existing force to stipulate tasks, it will inevitably delay the speed of national construction. Therefore, according to the requirements of national construction, actively expanding the geological exploration force and accelerating the training of geological exploration cadres and technical personnel are important tasks in the preparation of basic construction.

    Third, concentrate design strength to ensure the correct design of important projects. In the design, advanced Soviet technical standards should be adopted, and design procedures should be strictly followed, and the design review system should be improved to ensure that the design of the project is technically advanced and economically reasonable. The practice of only pursuing appearance but not practical results in design, and the practice of blindly expanding the safety factor and wasting state funds, are essentially reflections of bourgeois ideology and must be criticized and overcome.

    Fourth, organize construction according to the correct engineering design, such as determining the construction procedures, stipulating the annual workload and project progress of the project, drawing the overall construction plan, organizing the supply of building materials, designing temporary buildings (such as dormitories for basic construction workers, etc.), designing temporary roads and water and electricity supply, preparing construction machinery and tools, organizing construction technicians and construction workers, and preparing temporary construction workshops, so that the construction of each project can be carried out in an orderly manner.

    The task of large-scale construction is in front of us. We should strive to learn from the experience of Soviet construction, timely summarize our successful experiences and lessons learned in construction, so as to grasp the laws of national construction as soon as possible and steadily realize the glorious task of national industrialization.

### 大规模建设必须抓住主要环节

    大规模建设必须抓住主要环节
    由于我国经济特别是工业生产的恢复和发展，各项社会改革的完成，人民民主专政的巩固，国防力量的增涨，使我们国家基本上具备了进行大规模建设的条件。
    我们今后的建设事业，其规模之大，任务之复杂和艰巨，在我国历史上将是空前的，只有全党和全国人民集中全力以赴，才能有效地和尽速地完成国家大规模建设的任务。
    我们国家大规模的建设事业，必须抓住主要的环节，集中力量去进行。当前我们建设的主要目标，在于发展我国的工业；在发展工业中，又是首先着重于生产生产资料的工业的发展，即重工业——冶金、燃料、机械、电力的发展。因为只有重工业的发展，才能保证国防的巩固、带动国民经济全面发展并为稳步地实现国家工业化奠定可靠的基础。这个道理是很容易理解的，似乎是没有人持有异议的了，但这是不是说，在我们的一切实际工作中，都已经贯彻了这个方针呢？或者说每个人在思想上都已经明确地认识了呢？
    事实并非如此。在我们的基本建设工作中，“头发胡子一把抓”的现象，和不顾全局的局部观点，仍然是严重存在的。有些同志热心过度，希望把好事一下办完，企图一下子把各种建设都搞起来；也有些同志不考虑国家整个的建设计划，只从局部的需要出发，要求国家多给他们分配资金或人力，而不愿抽调本地区、本部门的干部到别的更重要的方面去。这些同志的主观愿望也许都是好的，但其结果，却常常把事情弄糟，使国家的建设事业遭受不应有的损失。由于我们国家有待于建设的地方很多，有千百万件工程需要进行，而且从局部看，每一件工程都是急需的，都是有利于国家和人民的，正是这样，有一些同志便忘掉了全局，不能保持清醒的头脑，在大规模建设中分不清轻重缓急。这样的同志不懂得，或没有真正懂得，不分轻重地分散使用我们的资金和人力，实际上等于削弱国家建设的力量，延缓国家工业化的速度，这和军事上的“分兵把口”是同样性质的错误。我们应该认识到，我们国家今天的建设，不仅以重工业为主，而在重工业的建设中，也应分别主要工程与次要工程，分别急需的工程与不急需的工程，分别基本工程与附属工程，绝不能有所混淆或轻重倒置。我们必须集中足够的资金与人力，保证国家当前最急需的重要工程的建设。这不仅是因为这样的工程对于我国实现工业化的速度有着头等重要的意义，而且按照我们国家目前的主观力量和各种条件来说，也必须这样做。我们国家当前还在进行伟大的抗美援朝斗争，我们虽然已尽了一切可能增加工业基本建设的基金，但它比起我们国家的建设需要来仍然是不足的。因此，我们必须把有限的资金集中地用到急需的地方，用在对发展国民经济有重要意义的重点工程上。再从我们建设的能力来说，不论是地质勘察、设计或施工的力量，都还远远落后于客观的需要，因此，除了应该迅速增强这些力量以外，目前我们也只能把有限的人力集中使用到急需的地方，用在对发展国民经济有重要意义的重点工程上。
    由此可见，集中力量于重工业的建设，特别是集中力量于能加速国家工业化速度的重要工程的建设，是我们国家大规模建设中必须采取的方针和必须遵守的原则。由此可见，那种百废俱举的思想，那种把国家大规模建设错误地理解为样样都应该大规模、处处都要大规模的观点，对当前国家建设事业是极其有害的，是必须加以防止和反对的。由此可见，把抓住主要环节的思想贯彻到基本建设的一切工作中去，是党和政府以及经济领导部门最重要的一项任务。
    正是在这样的意义上，在我们国家需要扩展重工业基础特别是必须抓住重要工程建设的意义上，我们必须把基本建设提到经济建设工作的首要地位。
    把工业的基本建设放到首要地位，这就要求各级党和政府以及经济领导部门，把领导的力量时刻放在工业的特别是重点工程的基本建设方面，及时研究和解决其中的问题，总结和推广成功的经验，并与离开这一方针的一切不良倾向作斗争。把工业的基本建设放到首要地位，就必须组织强大的基本建设的队伍，从各个方面尤其要从工业生产部门抽调优秀的干部、工程技术人员和有经验的工人参加这一工作，以增强基本建设的机构，扩大地质勘察、设计、施工的力量，健全政治工作，以此保证重要工程的如期完成，同时大力准备基本建设的后备力量。把工业的基本建设放到首要地位，又要求有关部门——运输部门、劳动部门、地方工业部门、贸易部门、财政部门、科学研究部门及市政建设等部门的配合，特别是对重要工程的配合，大力协助基本建设部门保证运输、建筑材料及劳动力等困难的顺利解决。只有这样，才算是在实际上而不是在口头上把基本建设放到首要地位，才不致使正确的口号变成一句空话。
    把工业的基本建设放到首要地位，就应该对基本建设的重要工程作充分的准备。有无准备和准备的好坏，是具体测量我们是否真正把基本建设放到首要地位的标准。
    为了做好基本建设工作，我们工业的和其他的领导部门，应该进行那些准备工作呢？
    第一，要正确地制定基本建设的计划。一个切合实际的计划，它必须是按照国家整个的建设方针和计划——比重、规模和先后，来具体地规定本部门每一年度建设的重点，而不是所属各个单位要求的简单的综合。基本建设的计划必须切实地逐级进行审查。我们的计划既不应离开目前的主观力量和条件，以至跑得太远，使计划脱离实际；也不应漠视在我们国家制度下的一切潜在能力，以至故步自封，使计划落在整个事业发展的后面。当前我们要着重反对那种不积极挖掘潜在力量和不采取有效措施壮大自己建设力量的保守思想。
    第二，有效地搜集和研究有关基本建设的资料，集中力量进行重要工程的地质勘察工作，为设计准备精确的材料。地质勘察力量的大小，是决定我们基本建设能否加速和正确进行的先决条件之一，而且它又是我们基本建设力量中最薄弱的一环，如果我们依靠现有力量规定任务，就势必要延迟国家建设的速度，因此，根据国家建设的要求，积极地扩大地质勘察力量，加速培养地质勘察的干部和技术人员，是基本建设准备工作中一项重要的任务。
    第三，集中设计力量，保证重要工程的正确设计。在设计中，应采用苏联先进的技术标准，并严格遵守设计程序，健全设计的审查制度，以保证工程的设计在技术上是先进的，在经济上也是比较合理的。那种在设计中只讲求外表而不求实效的作法，以及盲目扩大安全系数浪费国家资金的作法，实质上都是资产阶级思想的反映，必须予以批判和克服。
    第四，按照正确的工程设计，组织施工，如确定建设程序，规定工程的每年工作量和工程进度，绘制施工总平面图，组织建筑材料的供应，进行临时建筑物（如基本建设职工宿舍等）的设计，临时道路及水电供应的设计，施工机械工具的准备，组织施工技术人员和建筑工人，及进行临时施工车间的准备等，以便每一工程的施工都能有条理地进行。
    大规模的建设任务摆在我们的面前，我们应该努力学习苏联建设的经验，及时总结我们建设中成功的经验和失败的教训，以便尽速地掌握国家建设的规律，稳步地实现国家工业化的光荣任务。
