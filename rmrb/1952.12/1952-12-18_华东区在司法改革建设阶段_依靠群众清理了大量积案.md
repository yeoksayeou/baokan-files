The judicial reform movement construction phase in the East China Region has concluded. In this phase, East China earnestly mobilized the people, concentrated the wisdom of the people, cleared a large number of backlogged cases, educated a vast number of cadres and the masses, promoted central work, created new judicial systems and work styles, and provided good experience for future people's judicial construction.

The work of clearing backlogged cases in the East China Region by relying on the masses was carried out under the unified leadership of the local Party and government and the full cooperation of various departments. The steps were as follows: First, the judicial, public security, civil affairs, procuratorate, supervisory, and other government departments, as well as mass organizations such as the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and women's federations, jointly formed a Backlogged Case Clearing Committee. Then, cadres were drawn from various departments to form work groups (trial groups), which went to various districts to carry out work. After arriving in the districts, the work groups, together with district and township cadres and activists, formed a force to clear backlogged cases, starting work from points to areas. The specific method was to first convene meetings of cadres, mass representatives, or mediation committee members from districts, townships (streets), and mass organizations to publicize the significance of judicial reform, review the work of the courts, explain the necessity of mobilizing the masses to clear backlogged cases, and mobilize them to participate in the work of clearing backlogged cases. Then, typical cases were handled, and policies were specifically explained. Next, the local backlogged cases were ranked by region, and according to the principle of prioritizing urgent cases over less urgent ones and easy cases over difficult ones, case information was collected and verified, and collective mediation was conducted based on policies. Cases that could not be mediated were adjudicated and executed in a timely manner. Finally, experiences were summarized together with the masses, and opinions on the work of the courts were solicited from the masses.

The result of relying on the masses to handle backlogged cases was that existing backlogged cases were quickly resolved fairly and reasonably. In Suzhou, forty-six cases were handled in one hour at a collective mediation meeting. The broad masses of people greatly supported this mass line approach to handling cases and had greater trust in the people's courts. Therefore, a considerable number of newly received cases were also received in various places during the clearance of backlogged cases. In Fuzhou, among the 3,472 cases handled in thirty-five days, 1,275 were newly received cases. The land foundation dispute between Xu Tingru and Xu Baoshu in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, had been dragging on for more than sixty years. This time, after mass deliberation, it was resolved amicably in half a day.

The practice of relying on the masses to handle backlogged cases enhanced cadres' understanding of the need to rely on the masses in handling cases and criticized thoughts and work styles that violated this principle. In the past, many cadres unilaterally believed that even they, having been tempered by the revolution, inevitably made mistakes in handling cases, and that the masses would make even more mistakes. Therefore, they dared not boldly rely on the masses in handling cases. However, their views changed after being educated by the facts. Yongchun County, Fujian Province, adopted a simple "sitting in court to hear cases" method during judicial reform, and only cleared twenty-two backlogged cases in thirteen days. During the same period, the Jinjiang Prefectural Judicial Section assisted the county in relying on the masses to clear backlogged cases in one district, clearing 151 cases in three days, and making the parties very satisfied. These facts made the cadres' minds clear. They strictly criticized their old yamen work style of being detached from the masses, not investigating, and not researching, and realized that the high-and-mighty "official" work style was shameful and violated the interests of the people. During this period, the people were also educated. In the former South Jiangsu Region, the vast majority of counties and cities had about 60% of the masses educated in judicial reform, and about 20% of the masses, about 2 million people, participated in the work of handling cases. Many parties to cases understood the policies and received education in unity and education about the future. In the process of handling cases, through criticism and self-criticism, the masses' awareness was raised. Some automatically withdrew their cases, and some parties to cases resolved their issues through automatic consultation. According to statistics from various places in East China, cases resolved through mediation accounted for more than 90% of all cases. Various places also studied the causes of crime while handling cases, educated the masses, and took various measures to effectively prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior. For example, when handling marriage cases in Huian County, Fujian Province, the reasons for women's suicide were studied, more than 8,000 couples restored normal relations, and forty-nine groups preparing for collective suicide were broken up in eighty-six townships, saving 236 women who attempted suicide.

In the process of clearing backlogged cases, East China established and set up some new judicial systems and work styles. Mediation committees have been generally established or improved at the district and township (street) levels throughout the region. This committee can promptly mediate general civil disputes and minor criminal cases, and can also regularly conduct publicity on laws and regulations to the masses, turning the people's judicial work into the masses' own cause. Because cases were handled and judgments were executed in a timely manner locally, the litigation process was simplified, and the cumbersome procedures for accepting and closing cases were abolished. Various places adopted "mediation forms" or "case closure notices" when closing cases, abolishing the cumbersome format of "main text, facts, and reasons" left over from the reactionary courts.

East China adopted the principle of serving the central task and combining with central work in handling backlogged cases. For example, in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, cases were "queued" during the clearance of backlogged cases. Cases related to the central task were selected, publicly pronounced, and widely publicized. The masses were also mobilized to report more than 1,000 illegal cases of similar nature, which greatly promoted the central task. In the typical experiment of implementing the Marriage Law in Huian County, marriage cases were handled on the one hand, and family democracy and harmony meetings were held to educate the masses on labor mutual aid, promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to statistics from twenty-eight townships, more than 2,000 households participated in mutual aid groups during the movement. According to statistics from twenty townships and four streets, more than 6,500 shares newly joined cooperatives.

    华东区在司法改革建设阶段
    依靠群众清理了大量积案
    华东区司法改革运动建设阶段的工作已经结束。在这一阶段中，华东区认真发动了人民群众，集中了人民群众的智慧，清理了大量的积案，并教育了广大干部和群众，推动了中心工作，创造了新的司法制度和作风，为今后的人民司法建设提供了良好经验。
    华东区依靠群众清理积案的工作，是在当地党政统一领导与各部门通力合作之下进行的。步骤是先由司法、公安、民政、检察、监察等政府部门及青年团、工会、妇联等群众团体联合组成清理积案委员会，再由各部门抽调干部组成工作组（审判组），分赴各区进行工作。各工作组到区后，与区、乡干部及群众积极分子，共同组成清理积案的力量，由点到面地开始工作。具体作法是，先召开区、乡
    （街）及群众团体的干部、群众代表或调解委员的会议，宣传司法改革的意义，检讨法院的工作，说明发动群众清理积案的必要，动员他们参加清理积案的工作。然后处理典型案件，具体交代政策。接着即将当地的积案，依地区排队，按照先急后缓、先易后难的原则，搜集和对证案情，根据政策，进行集体调解。调解不成的案件即判决处理，并及时执行。最后和群众一同总结经验，并征求群众对法院工作的意见。
    依靠群众处理积案的结果，使已有的积案迅速得到公平合理的解决。苏州市在一个集体调解会上，一小时处理了四十六个案件。广大群众对于这种群众路线的办案方式十分拥护，对人民法院更加信任。因此，各地在清理积案中又收到相当多的新收案件。福州市在三十五天中处理的三千四百七十二件案件中，就有新收的案件一千二百七十五件。江苏江阴县徐廷如和徐保树的田基纠纷，已经拖了六十余年，这次经过群众评议，在半天内就和解了。
    依靠群众处理积案的实践，提高了干部对于办案必须依靠群众的认识，并批判了违反这一原则的思想和作风。过去许多干部片面地认为自己经过革命锻炼，办案尚难免发生错误，群众更会发生错误，因而在处理案件中不敢大胆依靠群众。但是，经过事实的教育，他们的看法改变了。福建省永春县在司法改革中采取单纯“坐堂问案”的方法，十三天中只清理积案二十二件；在同一时期，晋江专署司法科协助该县在一个区，依靠群众清理积案，三天中就清理了一百五十一件，且使当事人十分满意。这些事实，使干部的头脑清醒了，他们对自己那种脱离群众、不调查不研究的单纯“坐堂问案”的旧衙门作风进行了严格的批判，认识到那种高高在上的“老爷”作风是可耻的，是违反人民利益的。在这一期间，人民群众也受到了教育。原苏南全区绝大部分县、市有百分之六十左右的群众受到司法改革的教育，有百分之二十左右的群众约二百万人参加了办案的工作。许多案件当事人懂得了政策，受到了团结的教育和前途的教育。在处理案件中间，经过批评与自我批评，群众的觉悟提高了，有些自动撤销了案件，也有些案件当事人双方自动协商解决了。华东各地统计，经调解解决的案件占全部案件百分之九十以上。各地在办案中又研究了犯罪原因，对群众进行教育，采取各种措施，有效地防止了犯罪行为的发生。如福建省惠安县在处理婚姻案件时，研究了妇女自杀的原因，使八千余对夫妇恢复了正常关系，并在八十六个乡中突破了四十九个准备集体自杀的集团，挽救了二百三十六个企图自杀的妇女。
    华东各地在清理积案过程中，创造并树立了一些新的司法制度与作风。全区已普遍建立或健全了区、乡（街）的调解委员会。这个委员会可以及时调处一般的民事纠纷及轻微的刑事案件，又能经常向群众进行法纪的宣传，使人民司法工作变成了群众自己的事业。各地由于就地及时处理案件，执行判决，因而诉讼程序被简化了，繁琐的收案、结案的手续被废除了。各地在结案时采用了“调解表”或“结案通知书”，废除了反动法院遗留下来的那套“主文、事实、理由”的繁琐的格式。
    华东各地在处理积案中采取了为中心服务、结合中心工作的方针。如福建省福州市在清理积案中，实行案件“站队”，选择其中与中心工作有关的案件，公开宣判，广泛宣传，又发动群众检举了同类性质的违法案件一千余件，对中心工作有很大推动作用。惠安县在贯彻婚姻法的典型试验中，一面处理婚姻案件，一面召开家庭民主和睦会议，向群众进行劳动互助的教育，推动了互助合作运动。据二十八个乡的统计，在运动中参加互助组的有二千余户。另据二十个乡四个街的统计，新参加合作社的有六千五百余股。
