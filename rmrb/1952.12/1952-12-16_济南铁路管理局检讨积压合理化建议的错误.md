A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Jinan Railway Bureau
    Self-Criticism for Accumulating Rationalization Proposals

    To the Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Huang Yuanchang in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on November 22 regarding our bureau's accumulation of his rationalization proposal is entirely correct. We completely accept this criticism.

    Comrade Huang Yuanchang's proposal to create an automatic separation flexible hose connector was reported to the bureau as early as January 12 of this year. After studying it, we believed that this proposal could be adopted, so we forwarded it to the Ministry of Railways for review. On February 28, the Ministry of Railways asked our bureau to conduct experiments. At that time, we were in the midst of the "Three-Anti" campaign, and the cadre originally handling the proposal was removed from his post and temporarily replaced by another cadre. Due to the lack of attention paid by leading comrades to the rationalization proposals of the masses, the absence of dedicated personnel to manage them, and the failure to supervise and inspect, Comrade Huang Yuanchang's proposal was accumulated for several months. This is mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading comrades of the bureau. We will further examine and deal with the shortcomings and errors in the work of handling rationalization proposals, and require the relevant personnel to conduct a profound self-criticism.

    检讨积压合理化建议的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报十一月二十二日“读者来信”栏刊登的黄远昌同志对我局积压他的合理化建议提出的批评，是完全正确的。我们完全接受这一批评。
    黄远昌同志创造自动分离软管连结器的建议，在今年一月十二日就报来管理局，我们研究后，认为这个建议可以采用，我们就把这个建议转送中央铁道部审查，二月二十八日中央铁道部要我局进行试验。当时正在“三反”运动期间，经办原建议的干部被撤职，临时由另一干部办理。由于领导同志对群众的合理化建议重视不足，没有设立专职人员管理，又没有督促和检查，使得黄远昌同志的建议积压数月之久。这主要是由于管理局领导同志有着官僚主义作风。我们要进一步检查处理合理化建议工作中的缺点和错误，并要有关人员进行深刻的检讨。
