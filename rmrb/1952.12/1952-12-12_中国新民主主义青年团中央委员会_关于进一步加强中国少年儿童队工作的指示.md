(I)
Since its establishment in 1949, the Chinese Young Pioneers, thanks to the care and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the joint efforts of youth league organizations at all levels and national instructors, has made considerable progress in its work. It now has 5.2 million members. The organization of the Young Pioneers, in coordination with school education, has also carried out many beneficial activities, such as cultivating children's patriotic ideological qualities, inspiring children's learning initiative, improving children's academic performance, and developing children's habits of collective life, all of which have provided excellent assistance to school education.

(II)
However, the work of the Young Pioneers still falls far short of the development and needs of national education. In some youth league organizations and among some youth league cadres, there is still a phenomenon of underestimating the work of the Young Pioneers, thinking that "children's work is insignificant." This is very wrong. Children are the future builders of the country. The Party has specifically entrusted the Youth League to lead this work, so that it can cooperate with national education to better cultivate the new generation. Today, the League organization has a considerable foundation, and League committees at all levels must pay greater attention to and earnestly lead this work.

Youth League committees above the provincial and municipal level should quickly establish departments for Young Pioneer work, and appoint full-time ministers or deputy ministers. Youth League prefectural and county committees should also appoint full-time or part-time cadres according to work needs. When it is impossible for the Youth League district committee to set up full-time cadres, appropriate measures should also be taken to manage this work (such as absorbing Party and Youth League members who do not leave production as the district's chief Young Pioneer instructors, helping the Youth League district committee to lead this work is one feasible method); at the same time, Youth League committees at all levels should often pay attention to this work, hold regular meetings to discuss Young Pioneer work, and help Young Pioneer work cadres improve their political and professional level and solve difficulties in their work, so that Young Pioneer work can be further developed.

(III)
The Young Pioneers is a broad-based children's organization. With the expansion of the influence of the Young Pioneers and the increase in the number of children entering school, the number of children requesting to join the Young Pioneers has also increased. Youth League committees in various places must pay attention to and actively carry out the development work of the Young Pioneers. However, leading this work must be planned and step-by-step. First, consider whether the following two conditions are met: (1) The Youth League committee must have someone responsible; (2) The school where the team is to be built must have suitable candidates who can serve as the chief instructor and squadron instructor. Otherwise, there is no need to rush to build the team, but rather actively create the conditions for building the team first, and then gradually carry out the work of building the team. When building teams and developing new members, we must pay attention to conducting education in accordance with the spirit of the Young Pioneer Charter, and prevent the deviation of formalism; at the same time, we must correct the phenomenon of excessively high conditions and complicated procedures.

(IV)
In the past, the activities of the Young Pioneers were mainly to cooperate with schools in conducting patriotic education, but not enough was done to help children learn their lessons well. In the future, the country will shift to long-term construction, and the motherland expects children to study better and develop more healthily. Therefore, in the work of the Young Pioneers, we must closely integrate patriotic education with learning cultural and scientific knowledge, further cooperate with school education, carry out various activities that assist learning and are beneficial to the normal development of children, help children learn their lessons well, and become a new generation that is brave, lively, strong, and loves the motherland and knowledge.

In order to better educate children, the instructors of the Young Pioneers and the cadres of the Young Pioneer work must continue to create and promote a variety of activities suitable for the age characteristics of children, and overcome the tendency of adultization in the activities of the team. In areas where the work foundation of the team is poor, especially in rural areas, there is still a common phenomenon of simply using children, mobilizing children to bear too much inappropriate social labor and political activities, which hinders children's learning and health, and must be corrected. Only in this way will it not hinder the development of young children, but help them to develop healthily and make continuous progress.

### 中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会  关于进一步加强中国少年儿童队工作的指示

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于进一步加强中国少年儿童队工作的指示
    （一）
    中国少年儿童队自一九四九年成立以来，由于共产党和人民政府的关怀和帮助，各级青年团组织和全国辅导员的共同努力，少年儿童队的工作已有了相当的开展，并已拥有五百二十万队员，队的组织配合学校教育，也进行了许多有益的工作，如培养儿童爱国主义的思想品质，启发儿童学习的自觉性，提高儿童的学习成绩，养成儿童集体生活的习惯等方面，均给学校教育以很好的帮助。
    （二）
    但是，少年儿童队的工作还远远跟不上国民教育的发展和需要。在若干青年团组织和青年团的干部中，还存在着轻视少年儿童队工作的现象，认为“娃娃工作，无足轻重”。这是很错误的。少年儿童是国家未来的建设者，党特别委托青年团领导这一工作，使之配合国民教育，更好地培养新的一代。今天团的组织已有相当基础，各级团委必须更好地重视并认真领导这一工作。
    各省市以上团委应迅速建立少年儿童工作部门，配备专职的部长或副部长；团的地委、县委也应根据工作需要，配备专职或兼职干部。团的区委不可能设专职干部时，也应采取适当办法管理这一工作（如吸收不脱离生产的党、团员总辅导员为区的少年儿童委员，帮助团区委领导这方面的工作，是可行的办法之一）；同时各级团委应经常关心这一工作，定期召开会议，讨论少年儿童工作，并帮助少年儿童工作干部提高政治业务水平，解决工作中的困难，以便少年儿童工作能进一步开展。
    （三）
    少年儿童队是广泛性的少年儿童组织。随着队的影响的扩大和入学儿童的增加，要求入队的少年儿童，也增多起来。各地团委对于少年儿童队的发展工作，必须重视而且要积极进行。但领导这一工作，要有计划有步骤，首先要考虑到以下两个条件是否具备：（1）团委要有人负责；（2）建队的学校要有适当的人选可以担任总辅导员和中队辅导员。不然则不必急于建队，而应积极地首先创造建队的条件，然后再逐渐开展建队的工作。在建队和发展新队员时，必须注意按照队章精神进行教育，防止形式主义的偏向；同时必须纠正条件过高、手
    续过繁的现象。
    （四）
    过去少年儿童队的活动主要是配合学校进行爱国主义教育，但在帮助儿童学好功课方面是做得不够的。今后国家转入长期建设，祖国期待于儿童的是更好地学习，更健全地发育成长。因此在少年儿童队的工作中，必须把爱国主义教育和学习文化科学知识密切地结合起来，进一步配合学校教育，开展各种辅助学习和有益于儿童正常发育的活动，帮助儿童学好功课，成为勇敢、活泼、健壮和热爱祖国、热爱知识的新的一代。
    为了更好地对儿童进行教育，少年儿童队的辅导员和少年儿童工作干部要继续创造并推广适合儿童年龄特点的多种多样的活动方式，克服队的活动中成人化的偏向。在队的工作基础较差的地区，特别是农村中，还较普遍地存在着单纯地使用儿童，动员儿童负担过多的不适当的社会劳动和政治活动现象，妨碍了儿童的学习和健康，必须注意纠正。如此才不致妨碍少年儿童的发育，而是帮助他们健全的发展，不断的进步。
