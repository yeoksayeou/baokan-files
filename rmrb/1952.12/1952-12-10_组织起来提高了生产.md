    Organized Labor Improves Production
    Comrade Editor: Our village is a small village of sixty-two households in the Yellow River flooded area, located eight miles south of Zhongmu County. Everyone knows the suffering of the farmers in the Yellow River flooded area under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. What has our life become now? Everyone is very concerned.
    Now our village has sixty-eight large livestock and twenty-nine calves. As soon as you enter the village, you can see the big and small cattle mooing. If we go to Zhang Shengfu's house, he will definitely invite you to his four spacious new houses that he built last year. Before you sit down, he will say to you: "I am over forty years old and have never lived in such a house. I used to have to bend over to enter the house; now I can walk in with my shoulders held high." Zhang Shengfu's family has five people, and they just had a little grandson this year. When they married their daughter-in-law in the past, they didn't even have a good meal. Now the whole family eats rice and white flour; when the daughter-in-law gives birth, there is also sugar and eggs. Such a life is not just for Zhang Shengfu's family, but almost every family is like this.
    Why has our life recovered so quickly? In a nutshell: "Chairman Mao leads us well." He came up with the path of mutual aid and cooperation for us, which improved production. Starting in 1950, I and four other poor and lower-middle peasants formed a mutual aid group. Now our mutual aid group has grown to twelve households. The whole village also followed suit, and a total of eleven mutual aid groups were established; only two households are individual farmers. Before liberation, our best land yielded more than ninety catties of wheat per mu; this year my wheat suffered from drought, but still yielded an average of one hundred and eighty catties, and the high-yield land can yield four hundred and seventeen catties. This is because organized labor has great strength, strong livestock, complete farm tools, good cultivation, more fertilizer, and the selection of excellent seeds. How can we not produce more grain! In order to further increase production, we have begun to turn dry land into irrigated land. This year, our village dug three wells and installed liberation-style waterwheels. I planted cabbage on one mu and two fen of land next to the well, and it is estimated that I can harvest more than 13,000 catties, equivalent to 4,000 catties of grain. This has promoted the farmers in the entire township. Everyone wants to turn dry land into irrigated land, and many people come to ask me: "Ask the government how much the waterwheel sells for? I will buy one now, don't wait until the autumn well-digging season to do it."

    组织起来提高了生产
    编辑同志：我们村是黄泛区里一个六十二户的小村庄，在中牟县城南八里。国民党反动派统治的时候，黄泛区农民的苦处大家是知道的。现在我们的生活变成了什么样？大家都很关心。
    现在我们全村已经有六十八条大牲口，二十九个小牛犊。一进村就可以看到大牛小牛??叫。如果我们走到张生福家，他一定请你到他去年才盖好的那四间宽敞的新房里去，没等你坐下，他就会向你说：“我四十多岁了，没住过这样的房。从前进房就弯腰；现在抗着膀子进。”张生福家五口人，今年才得了个小孙孙。从前娶儿媳妇时，都没吃上顿好的。现在全家吃的是大米白面；儿媳生小孩，还有糖，有鸡蛋。这样的生活不光是张生福一家，家家都差不多。
    为什么我们的生活恢复的这样快呢？千言万语只有一句话：“毛主席领导的好。”他给我们想出了互助合作的道路，提高了生产。从一九五○年开始，我和四家贫雇农成立了互助组，现在我们的互助组已发展到十二户。全村也都学样，共成立了十一个互助组；只有两家单干户了。解放前我们的地一亩好的收上九十多斤麦；今年我的麦子受了旱，还平均收一百八十斤，丰产地可以收到四百一十七斤。这是因为组织起来力量大，牲口壮实、农具齐全，耕的好，上粪多，又选了上好的种籽，怎能不多打粮呢！为了进一步的提高生产量，我们已开始把旱地变成水浇地。今年我们村打了三眼水井，装上了解放式水车。我把井边一亩二分地种上了白菜，估计可收一万三千多斤，折合四千斤粮。这一下推动了整个乡的农民，大家都想把旱地改成水浇地，许多人都来问我：“你问问政府水车怎样卖？我现在就买他一辆，不要等秋后打井季时再办了。”
