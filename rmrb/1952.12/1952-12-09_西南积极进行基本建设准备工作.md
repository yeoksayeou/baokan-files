    Southwest Actively Preparing for Basic Construction
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Southwest Region is actively preparing for basic construction to meet the national large-scale economic construction tasks of next year.
    The Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a conference on industry and mining from November 17th to 21st, deciding to strengthen leadership over basic construction work and vigorously prepare for basic construction. The meeting particularly emphasized that it is necessary to clearly recognize that basic construction is a project of vital and lasting importance, and it is necessary to overcome the idea of some factories and mines not attaching importance to basic construction. Basic construction work must be carried out in accordance with the basic construction procedures stipulated by the Central Committee, and it is necessary to ensure project quality and strengthen political work. In terms of organization, the meeting believed that the basic construction management of each factory and mine must be separated from production management, and an independent Party committee and an independent trade union must be organized to lead basic construction work. In terms of cadres, the meeting required the provincial and municipal committees of the Southwest to make the greatest determination to transfer and allocate cadres as early as possible, so as not to affect the national construction plan and make the work passive. At the same time, existing talents should be concentrated and used as a priority. The meeting pointed out that the reason why the basic construction tasks in the Southwest Region have not been completed on schedule in the past two and a half years, especially the design work lagging far behind the construction requirements, in addition to some objective reasons, the most important reason is that the strength has not been concentrated and used. At present, there is a great shortage of technical personnel. If they are used in a scattered way, nothing will be accomplished. In addition, the meeting required that in areas with heavy basic construction tasks, the provincial and municipal committees should shift their main strength to the leadership of basic construction work in a timely manner.
    Before and after the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's conference on industry and mining, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee held a special basic construction work conference to summarize past experiences and arrange future work. The Southwest Industrial Department's Bureau of Electricity, Bureau of Mechanical Industry, and Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau also held basic construction conferences and construction engineering conferences successively. Now all relevant departments are actively taking action under a unified and clear direction and steps. The bureau-level organs under the Southwest Industrial Department have respectively established basic construction sections, geological sections, design sections, and engineering companies, clearly distinguishing the responsibilities of administrative management, planning, design, and construction, and resolutely overcoming the past confusion of all-inclusive packages. Currently, more than 2,000 cadres have been transferred from production departments and other aspects throughout the region, and more than 3,000 people are planned to be transferred to enrich and establish basic construction institutions. Technical personnel scattered in various provinces, cities, and agencies are now going through the process of returning to their units in order to concentrate their use. At present, there are 110,000 construction workers in the region, and 30,000 people will be fixed in a planned way next year. The Southwest Industrial Department has successively opened short-term construction technology professional schools this year to train a group of technical personnel; next year, various training courses will be opened on a larger scale to train various technical talents. In order to learn from the basic construction experience of other regions, the Southwest Region dispatched a delegation of more than 70 people, including managers of various engineering companies, technical personnel, and trade union cadres, to visit and study in Shenyang, Harbin, and other places from September 20th to November 20th. In addition, leading cadres and technical personnel from many basic construction departments have gone deep into the front lines to investigate and study, collect data, and have made preliminary estimates for next year. Projects such as dormitories, auditoriums, and bathrooms have initially implemented standard designs this year. Next year, the types of standard designs will continue to increase, and standard designs will be used for most projects except for factory buildings, in order to reduce design time, improve the technical level of designers, and ensure design quality. Designers will be concentrated in various specialized bureaus and used as a priority to solve the difficulty of the lack of designers and reverse the situation where design lags behind construction. Some important projects are planned to implement mechanized construction next year. To this end, the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau has allocated 150 billion yuan to purchase mechanical tools; the specialized bureaus of the Southwest Industrial Department will generally add mountain excavators, rock drills, dump trucks, light rails, and transportation hoisting equipment to earthwork projects next year.

    西南积极进行基本建设准备工作
    【本报讯】西南区正积极进行基本建设的准备工作，以迎接明年国家大规模经济建设任务。
    中共中央西南局于十一月十七日至二十一日召开工矿会议，决定加强基本建设工作的领导，大力做好基本建设的准备工作。会议特别强调要明确认识基本建设是百年大计，必须克服厂矿部门不重视基本建设的思想；必须按照中央所规定的基本建设程序进行基本建设工作，要保证工程质量，加强政治工作。在组织方面，会议认为各厂矿的基本建设管理必须与生产管理分开，必须组织独立的领导基本建设工作的党委会和独立的工会。在干部方面，会议要求西南各省、市委必须下最大决心，早调早配，以免影响国家建设计划和使工作陷于被动；同时应集中现有人材，重点使用。会议指出：两年半以来，西南区基本建设任务所以都没有按期完成，特别是设计工作远远落后于施工要求，除了一些客观原因之外，最主要的是没有集中使用力量。目前技术人员十分缺乏，如果分散使用，便会一事无成。另外，会议要求在基本建设任务很大的地区，省、市委应适时地将主要力量转向基本建设领导工作。
    在中共中央西南局工矿会议前后，西南财政经济委员会曾专门召开基本建设工作会议，总结过去的经验，布置了今后的工作。西南工业部电业管理局，机械工业管理局和西南建筑工程局亦先后召开了基本建设会议和建筑工程会议。现在各有关部门正在统一、明确的方针、步骤下，积极行动起来。西南工业部所属局一级机关分别成立了基本建设处、地质处、设计处、工程公司，明确分清行政管理、计划、设计、施工的责任，坚决克服过去一揽子包的混乱现象。现全区从生产部门和其他方面已抽调了二千多名干部，并准备抽调三千余人，充实和建立基本建设机构。分散在各省、市、各机关工作的技术人员，现在正办理归队工作，以便集中使用。目前全区共有十一万建筑工人，明年将有计划地固定三万人。西南工业部今年已先后开办了短期建筑技术专业学校，训练了一批技术人员；明年将更大规模地开办各种训练班培养各种技术人材。为了学习其它地区的基本建设经验，西南区曾抽调了各工程公司经理、技术人员、工会干部七十余人组成参观团，于九月二十日至十一月二十日分赴沈阳、哈尔滨等地参观学习。此外，许多基本建设部门的领导干部和技术人员深入现场调查研究，搜集资料，已作出了明年的概算定额。宿舍、礼堂、浴室等工程，今年已初步实行了标准设计。明年标准设计种类将继续增加，除了厂房工程外将大部使用标准设计，以便减少设计时间，提高设计人员的技术水平，保证设计质量。设计人员则将分别集中于各专业局，重点使用，以解决设计人员缺乏的困难，扭转设计落后于施工的局面。有些重要工程明年准备实行机械化施工。为此，西南建筑工程局已拨出一千五百亿元购买机械工具；西南工业部各专业局明年在土石方工程方面将普遍添置开山机、凿岩机、斗车、轻便轨道和运输起重设备。
