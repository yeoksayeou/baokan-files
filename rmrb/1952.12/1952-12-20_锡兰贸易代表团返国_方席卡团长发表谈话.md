Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Ceylon Trade Delegation, headed by Mr. Fonceka, departed from Beijing on the morning of the 19th to return home. Those who went to the station to see them off included Lei Renmin, Acting Minister of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government, Chen Jiakang, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department, and Lu Xuzhang, Manager of the China National Import and Export Corporation. Ji Chao-ding, Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Xie Xiaonai, Director of the Liaison Department of the Council, also went to see them off.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Mr. Fonceka, head of the Ceylon Trade Delegation, made the following remarks on the eve of his departure from China:

    On the eve of our departure, I would like to express my sincere joy at the happy conclusion of our trade negotiations. Thanks to the friendly spirit of Mr. Lei Renmin, the chief representative of China, and other Chinese representatives, we were able to sign a long-term rubber and rice agreement and two contracts for the purchase and sale of rubber and rice in 1953 in just two weeks. This agreement and these two contracts, which are subject to the approval of the Chinese and Ceylon governments, will enable the long-term trade agreement signed in Beijing in early October, which has been approved by our government, to be implemented. We believe that the rubber and rice agreement signed yesterday by me on behalf of the Ceylon government and Mr. Lei Renmin on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is beneficial to both countries.

    Our Ceylon delegation would also like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade for their hospitality and warm welcome, and we hope that the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade will convey our thanks to the Chinese government and people.

    We are leaving China today, but we cherish pleasant memories of this lovely country and its admirable people. When we first met you, we were complete strangers, and now we bid you farewell as close friends. Now, goodbye, we always feel reluctant to say this word, but we still have to say goodbye.

    锡兰贸易代表团返国
    方席卡团长发表谈话
    【新华社十九日讯】锡兰贸易代表团团长方席卡等一行于十九日上午离京返国。前往车站送行的有中央人民政府对外贸易部代理部长雷任民、外交部亚洲司司长陈家康、交际处处长王倬如、中国进出口公司经理卢绪章等人。前往送行的还有中国国际贸易促进委员会秘书长冀朝鼎及该会联络部部长谢筱乃。
    【新华社十九日讯】锡兰贸易代表团团长方席卡在离中国前夕发表谈话如下：
    在我们离开的前夕，我愿对我们贸易谈判的愉快的结束表示真诚的喜悦。由于中国首席代表雷任民先生及其他中国代表们的友善精神，使我们能够在短短两个星期中签订了长期橡胶和大米协定以及关于在短短两个星期中签订了长期橡胶和大米协定以及关于在一九五三年中买卖橡胶和大米的两个合同。这个有待中国和锡兰政府批准的协定以及这两个合同，将使业经我国政府批准的十月初在北京签订的长期贸易协定得以付诸实施。我们相信，昨天我代表锡兰政府、雷任民先生代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府签订的橡胶与大米协定，对两国都是有利的。
    我们锡兰代表团还愿乘此机会向中国国际贸易促进委员会表示衷心的谢意，感谢他们的款待和热诚欢迎，并希望中国国际贸易促进委员会把我们的谢意转达给中国政府与人民。
    我们今天离开中国了，但对这个可爱的国家和它的可羡慕的人民却怀抱着愉快的回忆。我们最初和你们见面时是完全陌生的客人，现在我们向你们告别时已成了至友。现在，再见吧，我们说到这个字眼里总是感到依依不舍，但是还得说再见吧。
