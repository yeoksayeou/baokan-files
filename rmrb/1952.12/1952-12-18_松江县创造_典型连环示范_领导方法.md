Songjiang County Creates "Typical Chain Demonstration" Leadership Method

In this year's patriotic production increase campaign, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, created a leadership method called "Typical Chain Demonstration," thereby universally and rapidly promoting the rice high-yield experience of Chen Yongkang, a national model farmer from the county.

Songjiang County's "Typical Chain Demonstration" is based on Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team starting cultivation half a month earlier this year. During several key agricultural seasons, the county first organized district and township cadres, agricultural labor models, and mutual aid team leaders to visit Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team in batches to learn about high-yield experience. Then, these district and township cadres, agricultural labor models, and mutual aid team leaders returned to their districts and townships and established 350 demonstration bases. Using Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience, they also started cultivation three to four days earlier. At this point, they organized farmer representatives from nearby villages to visit the demonstration bases in their respective areas. These farmer representatives, after returning to their villages, demonstrated to the farmers in their villages using the same method. In this way, a high-yield experience promotion network was formed, spreading from points to areas, one link after another. This year, Songjiang County conducted three large-scale "Typical Chain Demonstrations," with over 20,000 district and township cadres, agricultural labor models, and mutual aid team leaders visiting Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team, and over 100,000 farmers visiting demonstration bases in districts, townships, and villages.

The effect of Songjiang County's "Typical Chain Demonstration" is enormous. This year, 65% of the county's rice paddies applied Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience to varying degrees, resulting in a yield increase of 20% to over 40% per unit area compared to last year. 35% of the rice paddies did not apply Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience, only generally paying attention to processing and fertilization, resulting in a yield increase of only about 10% per unit area compared to last year. However, overall, thanks to the widespread application of Chen Yongkang's rice high-yield experience, the county's 813,000 mu of rice paddies achieved an average yield of approximately 560 jin per mu this year, an increase of 25% compared to last year, forming a county-wide rice bumper harvest.

Under the leadership of the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Songjiang County farmers began to embark on the path of organizing to develop production after completing land reform in the winter of 1950. Last year, some agricultural technicians went to the countryside to guide farmers in improving cultivation techniques, which played a certain role, but it was still difficult to meet the needs of the majority of farmers. During the autumn harvest, Chen Yongkang, a farmer from Chang'an Village in Songjiang County, achieved a high yield of 1,433 jin of rice per mu. The Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party helped him summarize his thirty years of rice cultivation experience and began to study how to promote his high-yield experience throughout the county. This spring, when the patriotic production increase campaign began, a small number of production-enthusiastic farmers in Songjiang County automatically went to Chen Yongkang's place to visit and learn. After returning, they immediately used Chen Yongkang's cultivation methods to experiment and led the surrounding farmers to generally learn Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience. This method of promoting high-yield experience, created by the masses of farmers themselves, immediately received the attention of the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which decided to organize and lead it in a planned way. Thus, the "Typical Chain Demonstration," centered on Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team, was enthusiastically launched throughout the county.

After Songjiang County launched the "Typical Chain Demonstration," both cadres and farmers received a great education. When the promotion of Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience began, the struggle between progressive and conservative ideas among the farmers was very sharp. In many villages, there were disputes between husband and wife, and disagreements between father and son. However, after one "typical chain demonstration" after another, conservative ideas among farmers, such as "production has reached its limit," "farming has no master," and "learning bad habits will ruin the fields," were gradually corrected. For example, Tan Zhengxiang, a farmer from Xinglong Village, was initially very unconvinced by Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience because he had been farming for twenty years and had always believed that "farming has no skills, just pig manure and red clover" (meaning that as long as you apply more fertilizer). At the Songjiang County Farmers' Representative Conference held at the end of March this year, he deliberately set a large plan for himself to produce 1,800 jin of rice per mu, exceeding Chen Yongkang's output. At that time, Wang Debiao, secretary of the Chengdong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, explained and persuaded him and encouraged him to learn Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience to increase his yield based on his current level. Later, he took the initiative to ask Chen Yongkang for advice several times, personally measured the area of Chen Yongkang's high-yield field, and saw with his own eyes that Chen Yongkang's rice had as many as 270 grains per panicle, and the rice stalks were as thick as cigarettes, before he was completely convinced. He finally lowered his original production increase plan to 1,000 jin of rice per mu. After returning home, he decided to try Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience, but he encountered opposition from his wife, Zhang Ajuan. After persuasion from the director of the village women's representative meeting, Tan Zhengxiang and Zhang Ajuan decided to use the poorer four mu of land as an experiment. Zhang Ajuan was originally afraid that Chen Yongkang's salt water seed selection would not sprout, that the "sparse sowing" method would not produce enough seedlings, and that the "small plant close planting" method, with only two or three seedlings planted in each hole, would be blown down by the wind.

The actual results shown by the "Typical Chain Demonstration" solved these problems one by one. In terms of cadres, the "Typical Chain Demonstration" enabled them to learn production techniques and improve their leadership style. For example, the cadres of Xinshi Township initially simply called on everyone to learn Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience at the township farmers' representative conference and arranged for everyone to immediately use salt water to select seeds after returning, but there was no movement after the meeting. At this time, the Xinshi Township branch of the Communist Youth League held a branch meeting. Shen Guiliang, the branch secretary, realized that cadres who did not understand production technology could not lead farmers to improve production technology by simply making empty calls. At the meeting, it was unanimously decided that the Youth League members should take the lead in learning production technology, establish a technical research group, and carry out "Typical Chain Demonstration." Shen Guiliang also took the initiative to take out three mu of land as a demonstration field. In this way, Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience was quickly promoted throughout the township. During the autumn harvest, the entire township achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 560 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 30% compared to last year. Currently, three-quarters of the district, township, and village cadres in Songjiang County have learned Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience and can specifically guide the masses of farmers to improve production.

Some people believe that rural areas are scattered and agricultural seasons are tight, making it difficult to timely and universally promote advanced production experiences and agricultural science and technology. The success of Songjiang County's "Typical Chain Demonstration" provides a good example for solving the above difficulties. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, only a little over 100 mu of fields in Songjiang County were cultivated using Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience. As the "Typical Chain Demonstration" unfolded, it expanded to over 7,000 mu by sowing time, and then leaped to over 500,000 mu by transplanting time.

The "Typical Chain Demonstration" created by Songjiang County has not only achieved great success in the rice-growing area, but it has also been very effective in promoting improved cotton seeds and pest control in the cotton-growing area. During the wheat planting season after the autumn harvest this year, Songjiang County launched a "Typical Chain Demonstration" to improve wheat planting techniques, with the county farm as the core.

Over the past year, the implementation of the "Typical Chain Demonstration" in Songjiang County has gradually made learning and promoting advanced production experience a conscious requirement and action of the farmers throughout the county. The farmers in the county reflect: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government will Chen Yongkang, this 'Field Champion,' emerge!" "In the past, if any family had good experience, they would only pass it on to their sons and not their daughters. Now, Chen Yongkang's good experience has been universally promoted. Only the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government can achieve this!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    松江县创造“典型连环示范”领导方法
    江苏省松江县在今年的爱国增产竞赛运动中，创造了一个叫做“典型连环示范”的领导方法，从而普遍迅速地推广了该县的全国丰产模范陈永康的水稻丰产经验。
    松江县的“典型连环示范”，是根据陈永康互助组今年提早半个月耕作的情况，在几个主要的农时季节，首先组织全县的区、乡干部、农业劳动模范和互助组组长等，分批去陈永康互助组参观学习丰产经验；然后，这些区、乡干部、农业劳动模范和互助组组长，回到自己的区、乡建立了三百五十个示范基点，他们运用陈永康的丰产经验，也都提早三、四天耕作，这时就再组织附近村庄的农民代表，分别到各示范基点去参观学习；这些农民代表回村后，又用同样方法给本村农民示范。这样，便形成了由点到面的、一环接一环的丰产经验推广网。松江县今年共开展过三次大规模的“典型连环示范”，先后去陈永康互助组参观学习的区、乡干部、农业劳动模范和互助组组长有二万多人，去区、乡、村各示范基点参观学习的农民有十多万人。
    松江县“典型连环示范”的效果，是非常巨大的。今年全县百分之六十五的稻田在不同程度上运用了陈永库的丰产经验，单位面积产量比去年增产二成到四成多；百分之三十五的稻田没有运用陈永康的丰产经验，仅仅一般地注意了加工施肥，单位面积产量比去年只增产一成左右。但是总的说来，全县八十一万三千多亩稻田，由于大部分运用了陈永康的水稻丰产经验，今年平均每亩产稻谷约五百六十斤，比去年增产二成半，形成了全县水稻的大丰产。
    在中共松江县委员会领导下，松江县农民自一九五○年冬天完成土地改革后，就开始走上组织起来发展生产的道路。去年，松江县有一些农业技术人员下乡指导农民改进耕作技术，起了一定的作用，但还难于满足广大农民的要求。秋收时，松江县长岸村农民陈永康创造了一亩水稻收一千四百三十三斤的高额产量，中共松江县委员会就一面帮助他总结三十年来栽培水稻的经验，一面开始研究如何把他的丰产经验在全县推广。今年春天，爱国增产竞赛运动开始时，松江县有少数生产积极的农民，自动到陈永康那里去参观；他们回去后，又立即照陈永康的耕作方法去试验，并且又带动周围的农民，普遍学习了陈永康的丰产经验。这个农民群众自己创造的推广丰产经验的方法，立即得到中共松江县委员会的重视，他们决定有计划地加以组织和领导；于是，以陈永康互助组为核心的“典型连环示范”，就在全县热烈开展起来。
    松江县开展“典型连环示范”以后，干部、农民都受到了很大的教育。在开始推广陈永康的丰产经验时，农民中进步思想和保守思想斗争的很尖锐，不少村庄曾因此发生过夫妻争论、父子意见不统一等事情；但是，经过一次又一次的典型连环示范，农民中“增产到顶”、“种田无师傅”、“学坏了要荒掉田”等保守思想，就逐渐得到纠正。例如：兴隆村农民谈正祥开始对陈永康的丰产经验很不服气，因为他自己种了二十年田，一向以为“种田无技巧，猪灰、红花草”（意即只要多施肥料）。他在今年三月底召开的松江县农民代表大会上，故意给自己订了一个超过陈永康的每亩产稻谷一千八百斤的大计划；当时中共城东区委员会书记王德标就向他解释说服，并鼓励他学习陈永康的丰产经验，让他在现有基础上提高产量。后来，他几次主动地向陈永康请教，亲自去测量了陈永康丰产田的面积，亲眼看到陈永康的稻子每穗有二百七十粒之多，稻秆也足有香烟那么粗，才完全信服。他终于把原订的增产计划降低到每亩产稻谷一千斤。他回家后，决心试验一下陈永康的丰产经验，但又遇到他老婆张阿娟的反对。经过村妇女代表会主任的劝解，谈正祥和张阿娟才决定把较差的四亩田作为试验。张阿娟原来对陈永康的盐水选种怕不出芽，对“落谷稀”播种法怕秧苗不够，对“小株密植”插秧法怕一穴只插二、三根秧苗会被风吹倒，都在
    “典型连环示范”所显示的实际成效中，一一获得解决。在干部方面，“典型连环示范”使他们学会了生产技术，改进了领导作风。例如：新石乡干部起初在全乡农民代表大会上简单地号召学习陈永康的丰产经验，布置大家回去后马上用盐水选种，但是会后却没有动静。这时，青年团新石乡支部就召开支部大会。支部书记沈桂良认识到干部不懂生产技术，光靠空口号召，自然不能领导农民改进生产技术。会上，一致决定青年团员要带头学习生产技术，成立技术研究小组，进行“典型连环示范”；沈桂良并自动拿出三亩田来做示范田。这样，陈永康的丰产经验就很快在全乡推广开来。秋收时，全乡普遍丰收，平均每亩产稻谷五百六十斤，比去年增产三成。松江县目前已有四分之三的区、乡、村干部学会了陈永康的丰产经验，并能具体指导农民群众改进生产。
    有人认为：农村地区分散，农时季节紧迫，很难及时地普遍地推广先进生产经验和农业科学技术。松江县“典型连环示范”的成功，对解决上述困难，提供了一个好的榜样。今年春耕开始时，松江县运用陈永康丰产经验耕作的田亩只有一百多亩，随着“典型连环示范”的展开，到播种时就扩大到七千多亩，一个多月后插秧时，更飞跃地扩大到五十多万亩。
    松江县创造的“典型连环示范”，不只在水稻区获得了巨大的胜利，而且在棉区推广改良棉种和治虫方面也很有成效。今年秋收后的种麦季节，松江县又以县农场为核心，开展了改进种麦技术的“典型连环示范”。
    一年来，松江县开展“典型连环示范”的结果，已经使学习和推广先进的生产经验，逐渐成为全县农民自觉的要求和行动。该县农民反映：“只有在共产党、人民政府的领导下，才会出现陈永康这个‘田状元’！”“过去谁家有了好经验，只传儿子不传女儿；现在陈永康的好经验普遍推广，只有共产党和人民政府的领导才能得到！”（新华社）
