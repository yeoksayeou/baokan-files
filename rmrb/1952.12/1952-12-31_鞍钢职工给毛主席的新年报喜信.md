Anshan Iron and Steel Workers Send New Year's Greetings to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao,

Under your leadership and the leadership of the Party, and with the help of Soviet experts, all the workers of our production plants and mines have unleashed patriotic labor enthusiasm and class wisdom. Under the direct leadership of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League organizations in our plants and mines, we have vigorously carried out movements to promote advanced experiences. Therefore, after completing the annual national total production value plan and the total increase in production and savings plan in November, today—December 29th, all major products, including pig iron, steel ingots, steel billets, medium-sized steel, small-sized steel, steel pipes, thin plates, iron-rich ore, sintered ore, and coke, have all completed the increased production plans.

In the operation of blast furnaces in the iron smelting plant, due to the learning of advanced Soviet technology, we have created a series of advanced experiences such as the "furnace top adjustment method," "steam blowing operation method," "full wind fast charging method," "wind pressure adjustment method," and "rapid furnace heating method," thereby improving the output and quality of pig iron. The utilization coefficient of effective volume reached a new record high of 0.602 in No. 4 blast furnace in November. The average for the entire plant in November reached 0.734, and was reduced to 0.793, with quality exceeding the plan.

In the steel smelting plant, a thermal management system was implemented, new technical operating regulations were carried out, and indirect steelmaking methods were discarded. Some preliminary refining furnaces were converted into open-hearth furnaces for direct and rapid steelmaking. As a result, the average daily calendar utilization coefficient of the furnace bottom heating area reached 6.07 in November, and No. 4 open-hearth furnace set a new record of 6 hours and 9 minutes for steelmaking, with quality exceeding standards. The equipment utilization coefficients of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces not only far exceeded the levels of the enemy puppet era but also exceeded the highest levels of various capitalist countries. In various steel rolling mills, rapid steel rolling methods have been created and promoted. In particular, Comrade Zhang Mingshan, a worker in the small steel mill, invented the "anti-surround disc," which automated the rolling of small steel, greatly improving labor conditions and increasing labor productivity, changing the face of the steel rolling mill.

In this year's surging production struggle, we have also cultivated a large number of excellent enterprise management cadres and workers-turned-technicians, and emerged hundreds of labor models and thousands of advanced producers, transferring a large number of cadres to the capital construction front, strongly supporting the work of capital construction.

Chairman Mao, these achievements demonstrate the superiority of the new democratic social system and show the great creative power of the Chinese working class under your leadership. All our workers will definitely not be arrogant or complacent. With redoubled efforts and confidence, according to your instructions, in order to welcome next year's large-scale economic construction, we will strive to overfulfill the national production plan for 1953 and the new glorious task of smelting high-quality steel!

We wish you boundless longevity!

All Workers of State-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    鞍钢职工给毛主席的新年报喜信敬爱的毛主席：
    在您和党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们生产厂矿的全体职工发挥了爱国主义的劳动热情和阶级的智慧；我们在各厂矿党、政、工、团的直接领导下，大力开展了推广先进经验的运动。因此，我们继十一月份完成了全年国家生产总值计划和增产节约总值计划之后，在今天——十二月二十九日上午各主要产品：生铁、钢锭、钢坯、中型钢材、小型钢材、钢管、薄板、铁富矿、烧结矿、焦炭等全部完成了增产计划。
    在炼铁厂高炉操作方面，由于学习了苏联先进技术，创造了“炉顶调剂法”“蒸汽鼓风操作法”“全风快料顺行法”“风压调剂法”“快速烧炉法”等一系列先进经验，从而提高了生铁的产量和质量，有效容积利用系数在十一月中四号高炉创造了零·六零二的最高新纪录，十一月份全厂平均已达到了零·七三四，无比降低至零·七九三，质量超过了计划。
    在炼钢厂实行了热工管理制度，贯彻了新的技术操作规程，抛弃了间接炼钢的方法，将部分预备精炼炉改为平炉，进行了直接的快速的炼钢，因而十一月份炉底受热面积按日历利用系数平均达到六·零七，四号平炉并创出六小时零九分钟的炼钢时间新纪录，质量超过标准。高炉、平炉的设备利用系数，不但远远地超过了敌伪时代的水平，也超过了各资本主义国家的最高水平。在轧钢各厂，创造并推广了快速轧钢法，特别是小型厂工友张明山同志发明了“反围盘”，使小型钢材的轧制自动化，从而大大地改善了劳动条件，提高了劳动生产率，改变了轧钢工厂的面貌。在这一年的澎湃的生产斗争中，我们也培养了大批优良的企业管理干部和工人出身的技术人员，涌现了成百的劳动模范和成千的先进生产者，向基本建设方面输送了大批干部，大力的支援了基本建设的工作。毛主席，这些成绩说明了新民主主义社会制度的优越性，显示了中国工人阶级在您的领导下的伟大创造力量，我们全体职工一定不骄不傲，以百倍的努力和信心，按照您的指示，为迎接明年大规模经济建设，超额完成一九五三年的国家生产计划，炼好优质钢的新的光荣任务而奋斗！祝您万寿无疆！
    国营鞍山钢铁公司全体职工
