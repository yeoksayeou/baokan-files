    The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Misuses Technical Personnel

    Editor: I am a graduate of the Department of Materials Engineering of Tangshan Railway College this year. Most of my classmates were assigned to work in various railway factories. I and nine other classmates (two of whom have now been transferred) were assigned to work in the Materials Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways. We have been working for more than three months and deeply feel that our work here is inconsistent with the technology we have learned. In school, we studied courses related to physics and metallurgy, such as: electrical engineering, thermodynamics, mechanical principles, locomotive engineering, steel alloys and heat treatment, etc. Studying such courses makes us very suitable for metal processing and heat treatment. However, what we are doing now is some business that we have never learned, such as: material supply plans, daily receipts and dispatches, dynamic monthly reports, and other procedures for planning, purchasing, and distributing materials. We don’t understand this industry at all and have to rush around copying forms and calculating accounts every day doing general administrative work. This phenomenon of "inconsistent learning and application" not only seriously wastes technical talents but also affects production work. As far as I know, railway factories across the country are in great need of technical personnel like us. Some factories are unable to complete their production tasks due to a lack of technical personnel in this area, and the quality of locomotives and vehicles is poor, resulting in rework, waste, and even accidents. However, the technology we have learned is completely shelved and cannot be directly and fully applied to the places where national construction needs it most.
    As far as I understand, similar situations are very common in the Materials Bureau. Many technical personnel are not using what they have learned. Every day they are either making lists, drafting official documents, or calculating accounts, copying reports, and compiling statistics. For example, the work of the Line Construction Materials Section is to purchase and distribute route construction materials, but the section has two civil engineers. Du Xianqi, who studied civil engineering, manages the supply of steel rails, and Zhao Peigao, who studied physics, manages the supply of cement, sundries, etc. The work of the Planning Section is also to handle material supply, but the section has an electrical engineer. Cheng Zude (a graduate of the Department of Civil Engineering), who assists this engineer in making material supply plans, said: "I have been doing this work for more than seven years, and technology cannot be used here." Wang Wenxiang, an engineer with more than 40 years of experience in material supply, also said: "At least 75 percent of the technical capabilities of various engineers working here cannot be utilized." He believes that cadres with general technical knowledge are sufficient to undertake general material supply work, and specialized technical personnel should be transferred to the positions most needed for industrial construction. However, these valuable opinions have not attracted the attention of the leadership.
    The main reason for this phenomenon is the departmentalism of the leading cadres of the Materials Bureau. They believe that it is more "convenient" for technical cadres to do material supply work, but they have not considered that this "convenience" has brought serious waste of talents to the country. Recently, the thinking of some technical personnel in the Materials Bureau has been relatively volatile, and they cannot concentrate on their work. The leadership uses the rationale that "the work of the Materials Bureau is also serving the people" to persuade them. In this way, some technical personnel are afraid that the leadership will criticize them for "emphasizing personal interests" and "not obeying organizational assignments," so they dare not mention job transfers again. I feel that in a situation where the motherland is carrying out large-scale economic construction and there is a great lack of technical personnel, the phenomenon of unreasonable use of technical personnel cannot be allowed to exist. Therefore, I hope you will support my request and suggest that the Central Ministry of Railways make reasonable adjustments to the use of specialized technical personnel.

    Editor's note: Judging from the situation reflected by reader Hou Xinghua, we believe that the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Railways needs to conduct an in-depth inspection of the use of technical personnel in relevant units. If there is a phenomenon of improper use of technical personnel, it should be resolutely adjusted reasonably; necessary persuasion and education work should also be carried out for some people who have opinions that should not be adjusted.

### 铁道部材料局使用技术人材不得当

    铁道部材料局使用技术人材不得当
    编辑同志：我是今年唐山铁道学院材料工程系的毕业生。我系大部分同学都被分配到各铁路工厂工作，我和另外九位同学（现已有二人调走）被分配在中央铁道部材料局工作。我们已经工作三个多月了，深深感到这里的工作和我们所学的技术，是不一致的。在学校里，我们学的是有关物理、冶金方面的课程，如：电工学、热力工程、机械原理、机车工程、钢铁合金及热处理等。学这样的课程，做金属加工、热处理一类的工作是很适合的。但是，我们现在做的却是一些从来没有学过的业务，如：材料供应计划、收发日报、动态月报等计划、采购和分配材料的手续制度，对这一行，我们根本不懂，每天只好忙乱于抄表格，打算盘等一般事务性的工作。这种“学用不一致”的现象，不仅严重地浪费了技术人材，而且使生产工作受到影响。据我所知，全国各铁路工厂都非常需要像我们这样的技术人员，有些工厂由于缺乏这方面的技术人员，已经影响到生产任务的完成，机车、车辆质量不好，造成返工浪费，甚至酿成事故。但是，我们所学的技术却完全搁置起来，不能直接充分地运用到国家建设最需要的地方去。
    据我了解，类似的情况，在材料局是十分普遍的。很多技术人员所学非所用，他们每天不是造清单、拟公文，就是打算盘、抄表报、统计数字等。例如：线路建筑材料课的工作是采购和分配路线建筑材料，但该课却有两个土木工程师，还有学土木工程的杜显岐同志管理钢轨的供应工作，学物理的赵佩皋同志管理洋灰、杂品等供应工作。计划课的工作也是搞材料的供应，该课却有一位电气工程师。帮助这位工程师做材料供应计划工作的程祖德同志（土木工程系毕业）说：“我搞这个工作七年多了，技术在这里用不上。”有四十多年材料供应工作经验的王文翔工程师也说：“在这里工作的各种工程师，至少有百分之七十五的技术能力不能发挥。”他认为只需有一般技术知识的干部，便足以担任一般的材料供应工作，专门技术人员应调到工业建设最需要的岗位上去。但这些宝贵的意见并没有引起领导上的重视。
    造成这种现象的主要原因，是材料局领导干部存在着本位主义思想。他们认为由技术干部做材料供应工作比较“方便”，却没有考虑到这种“方便”给国家带来了严重的人材浪费。最近一个时期，材料局某些技术人员思想比较波动，不能安心工作，领导上就以“材料局的工作也是为人民服务”的道理去说服他们。这样，有的技术人员惟恐领导上批评自己“强调个人兴趣”“不服从组织分配”，就不敢再提调动工作了。我觉得在祖国开展大规模经济建设而技术人材非常缺乏的情况下，使用技术人材不合理的现象，是不能允许存在的。因此，希望你们支持我的要求，建议中央铁道部合理调整对专门技术人材的使用。　　　　侯兴华
    编者按：从读者侯兴华所反映的情况来看，我们认为铁道部人事局有必要对有关单位使用技术人材的情况进行一次深入的检查。如果存在了对技术人材使用不当的现象，就应坚决进行合理调整；对某些不应该调整而有意见的人，亦应进行必要的说服和教育工作。
