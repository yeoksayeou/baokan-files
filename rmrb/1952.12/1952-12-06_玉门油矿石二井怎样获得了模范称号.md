How the Yumen Oilfield Shi No. 2 Well Obtained the Model Title

    The Shi No. 2 well of the Yumen Oilfield has the highest drilling efficiency among all exploration wells, and the direct cost per meter drilled is more than half lower than that of other exploration wells. Therefore, it was selected as a model exploration well for 1951 and received commendation and rewards from the Central Petroleum Administration Bureau and the Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau. How was this achievement obtained?
    First, relying on the masses to overcome difficulties. For example, before the highway was built, the masses were mobilized to use a small road to transport the drilling equipment, overcoming the work stoppage phenomenon, shortening the installation time, and advancing the start of drilling by a week. Another example is that the stratum in the exploration area is hard, and the drill bit is extremely easy to wear. When drilling at high speed, the drill pipe jumps severely, and accidents such as the tooth wheel falling into the well and the drill pipe breaking often occur, increasing the trouble of many salvage operations. The leadership mobilized everyone to conduct research at a technical research conference. As a result, based on the rock formation conditions in the area, everyone proposed changing the four-speed gear to a three-speed gear, overcoming the difficulties and increasing the drilling speed.
    Second, paying attention to safety and reducing accidents. When new apprentices come to work on the drilling platform, they are always given explanations of safe operating methods first. In addition, the method of formulating patriotic covenants is used to make everyone consciously abide by the safety system; individual violations of regulations will be subject to mass supervision and criticism. Apprentice Xu Yuru was usually arrogant, did not study modestly, and did not listen to the driller's command. He suffered minor injuries when tripping out the drill pipe. Everyone held a group meeting to criticize him, which made him pay attention to safety and also aroused everyone's attention to safety. Since then, no personal injury accidents have occurred in the well.
    Third, launching criticism and promoting unity. In the early stages of drilling, due to the poor organization of labor in each shift and the unsound system, each shift often shirked responsibility during handover. Zhao Wenxi's shift and Yang Wenzhong's shift had disunity due to shift handover. When formulating the patriotic covenant, everyone raised this shortcoming and launched criticism and self-criticism; then, after group deliberation and discussion, a strict handover system was formulated, eliminating the estrangement between the two shifts. The failure of some workers in the well to study politics is also a major reason for disunity. Therefore, Party members and Youth League members took the lead, united the masses, helped each other, and carried out reading newspapers to improve the political consciousness of the workers, thereby strengthening unity.
    Fourth, establishing a system and strengthening inspection work. During shift handover, machines are carefully checked, and a special inspection is carried out every two days. Each group has selected inspection committee members to be responsible for inspection work, and summarizes it once a week, which has played a role in reducing liability accidents. They have also established technical research conferences, driller liaison conferences, group discussion meetings, newspaper reading groups, etc. Through these organizations and meetings, they inspect work, exchange experiences, and conduct political and technical education for workers. A blackboard newspaper has also been established on the well site to conduct criticism and praise at any time, consolidating work achievements. (Attached pictures)

    玉门油矿石二井怎样获得了模范称号
    玉门矿务局
    西北玉门油矿石二井的钻进效率在各探井中最高，钻进每公尺的直接成本也比其他探井低一半以上，因而，被评选为一九五一年模范探井，并受到中央石油管理总局、西北石油管理局的表扬与奖励。这一成绩是怎样获得的呢？
    第一，依靠群众，克服困难。例如当公路未修通前，就发动群众利用便道把钻井设备运到，克服了停工现象，缩短了安装时间，使开钻时间提前了一星期。又如探区地层坚硬，钻头极易磨损；快车钻进时，钻杆跳动很厉害，时常发生牙轮落井和扭断钻杆的事故，增加了许多打捞工作的麻烦。领导方面发动大家在技术研究会上进行研究。结果，大家根据该区岩层的情况，提出改四道车为三道车的办法，克服了困难，增加了钻井的速度。
    第二，重视安全，减少事故。当新徒工到钻台工作时，总要先给他们讲解安全操作的方法。此外还通过订立爱国公约的方式，使大家自觉地遵守安全制度；个别违犯规定的，就会受到群众的监督和批评。徒工许毓如平时自高自大，不虚心学习，不听司钻的指挥，在起钻时，受了轻伤。大家举行小组会，批评了他，使他注意安全，并且也引起了大家对安全的重视。此后，该井再也没有发生过人身事故。
    第三，展开批评，促进团结。该井在开钻初期，由于各班劳动力组织的不好，制度不健全，在交接班时，各班常互相推诿责任。赵文喜班和杨文忠班就曾经因交接班而发生不团结的现象。在订爱国公约时，大家提出了这个缺点，展开了批评与自我批评；然后又经过小组酝酿、讨论，制订了严格的交接班制度，消除了两班的隔阂。该井部分工人，平时不学习政治，也是造成不团结的一个主要原因。因此由党团员带头，团结群众，互相帮助，并进行读报，使工人们提高政治觉悟，从而加强了团结。
    第四，建立制度，加强检查工作。在交接班时，都能认真检查机器，每两天还专门检查一次。各组都选出了检查委员，负责检查工作，每周总结一次，对减少责任事故起了作用。他们还建立了技术研究会、司钻联系会、小组讨论会、读报组等，通过这些组织和会议，检查工作，交流经验，向工人进行政治与技术教育。在井场上还建立了黑板报，随时进行批评和表扬，巩固了工作成绩。（附图片）
