Since the beginning of winter, the Beijing market has become more active, with the total turnover in November increasing compared to October. According to a typical survey of thirteen major private industries, the turnover of eight industries in November increased compared to October, one industry was the same as October, and four industries were slightly worse than October. It is worth noting that the turnover of industries most closely related to people's daily lives has increased even more. For example, the turnover of the grain industry increased by 10% in October compared to September, and then increased by 35% in November compared to October; the turnover of the coal industry was already close to the level of the same period last year in October, and the turnover in November reached the level of the same period last year; the turnover of the pasta industry increased by 8% in November compared to October; the turnover of stationery and paper industry increased by an average of 7% in November compared to October; the turnover of the new medicine industry increased by 24% in November compared to October; due to the needs of capital construction, the turnover of the hardware industry has also increased substantially. Although many projects have been suspended in winter, the turnover in November still increased by 25% compared to October. In addition, in the wholesale transactions of department stores and cotton cloth industries, the turnover of cotton cloth increased by 28.6% in November compared to October, and the turnover of department stores increased by 8% in November compared to October. Due to the active market, the turnover of the Beijing transportation industry also increased by more than 21% in November compared to October.

After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the private industrial and commercial sector in Beijing experienced a temporary period of depression. To address this, the Beijing Municipal People's Government organized various financial and economic departments to take a series of measures to change this situation. The People's Bank vigorously developed lending business, which solved the difficulties in capital turnover for some private industries. According to statistics from January to October alone, the number of loans increased by one and a half times compared to the total figure for the entire year of 1950, and the loan coverage expanded by four and a half times. State-owned trading companies processed, ordered, and purchased goods in large quantities, which solved the backlog of certain industrial products. State-owned trade implemented a wholesale-oriented policy in its business, which solved the difficulties of some private merchants in obtaining goods. Taking Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company as an example, the company's sales to private businesses in September accounted for only 20% of its total sales, increased to 34% in October, and further increased to 40.06% in November. At the same time, the Beijing Municipal People's Government assisted industrialists and business people in organizing trade delegations to go to various places to carry out material exchange fairs. The transaction volume at the Tianjin North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Fair alone reached 200 billion yuan. This further promoted the more active operation of private industry and commerce. According to the situation in October and November, the total turnover of wholesale and retail transactions in the Beijing market has reached the level of the same period last year. However, due to the increase in people's purchasing power and different needs for commodities, the operating conditions of various private industries are also different. For example, the turnover of industries such as paint, new medicines, meat, and pastries has exceeded the level of the same period last year; the turnover of industries such as department stores, local products and food, coal, oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar is comparable to the level of the same period last year, and other industries such as silk and cloth, and tea, although not yet reaching the level of the same period last year, have also improved a lot compared to before September. At present, in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of private businesses, state-owned trading companies are adjusting the wholesale starting points and wholesale-retail price differences of certain commodities. Since entering December, the turnover of private businesses has further increased.

### 北京市场入冬以来更趋活跃  十月、十一月份的营业总额已达到去年同期水平

    北京市场入冬以来更趋活跃
    十月、十一月份的营业总额已达到去年同期水平
    入冬以来，北京市场更趋活跃，十一月份的营业总额比十月份增加。据十三个主要私营行业的典型调查，十一月份有八个行业的营业额比十月份增加了，一个行业和十月份相等，四个行业比十月份稍差一些。值得注意的是和人民日常生活最密切的行业的营业额增加得更多。例如：粮食业十月份的营业额比九月份增加百分之十，十一月份又比十月份增加了百分之三十五；煤业的营业额在十月份已接近去年同期水平，十一月份的营业额即已达到去年同期水平；面食业的营业额十一月份比十月份增加百分之八；文具纸张业十一月份的营业额比十月份平均增加百分之七；新药业十一月份的营业额比十月份增加百分之二十四；五金业由于首都进行建设的需要，营业额也大量增加，虽在冬季许多工程相继停工的情况下，十一月份的营业额仍较十月份增加百分之二十五。又如百货、棉布两业的批发交易，棉布成交额十一月份比十月份增加百分之二十八点六，百货成交额十一月份比十月份增加百分之八。由于市场活跃，北京运输业的营业额十一月份也比十月份增加了百分之二十一以上。
    北京市私营工商业在“五反”以后，曾出现过暂时的消沉局面。为此，北京市人民政府组织了各财经部门，采取一连串的措施，改变这种情况。人民银行大力开展了贷款业务，解决了某些私营行业资金周转上的困难，仅据一至十月份十个月的统计，贷款数就比一九五○年全年总数字增加了一倍半，而贷款面则扩大了四倍半。国营贸易公司大量加工、定货，进行收购，解决了某些工业品的积压现象。国营贸易在业务上贯彻了以批发为主的方针，解决了私商某些货源不畅的困难。以北京市花纱布公司为例，该公司九月份对私营商业的销货量，只占其全部销货的百分之二十，十月份增加到百分之三十四，到十一月份就增到百分之四十点零六。同时北京市人民政府协助工商业者组织了贸易代表团，分赴各地开展物资交流会，只天津华北城乡物资交流会上的成交额即达二千亿元。这样就更促进了私营工商业的营业更加活跃。根据十月及十一月的情形来看，北京市场批发和零售交易的营业总额已经达到去年同期的水平。但由于人民购买力提高和对商品的需要不同，因而各私营行业的经营情况也不同。比如颜料、新药、肉类及糕点等行业的营业额，已经超过了去年同期水平；百货、土产食品、煤业、油、盐、酱、醋等行业的营业额则已与去年同期水平不相上下，其余如绸布、茶叶等行业虽然还未达到去年同期水平，但比九月份以前也提高了很多。目前为了更加发挥私营商业的积极性，国营贸易公司正在调整某些商品的批发起点与批零差价。进入十二月以来，私营商业的营业额更加上升。
