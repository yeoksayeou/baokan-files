In order to cultivate a large number of intermediate technical personnel needed for the country's industrial construction, preliminary adjustments and rectifications have been carried out in the industrial technical schools in North China.

Industrial technical schools in North China have developed considerably in the past three years. In the second half of 1950, there were only seven industrial technical schools with more than 3,300 students. By the first half of this year, the number of industrial technical schools had increased to twenty-two, with 10,000 students. However, these schools, both in terms of quantity and quality, are far from meeting the actual needs, especially the number and scale of heavy industry schools are far from the actual needs. In order to change this situation, to give the secondary technical schools a clear training objective, and to set up majors according to the production needs of the business departments, and to train technical personnel in large quantities, it is necessary to vigorously carry out adjustments and rectifications.

The adjustment and rectification of industrial technical schools in North China is based on the existing industrial technical schools, and is carried out in a coordinated manner throughout the region, according to the focus and distribution of industrial construction in North China in the next three to five years provided by the relevant central industrial departments, and the needs of local industrial construction in various provinces and cities in North China for secondary technical cadres. After adjustment and rectification, there are now 31 industrial technical schools in North China, an increase of nine compared with before the adjustment and rectification. Except for some industrial schools in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou and other places which are determined to be comprehensive industrial schools for general machinery, electrical machinery, chemical industry and textile industry, other schools tend to be specialized and singular. For example, the new Iron and Steel School and Machine Manufacturing School were established on the basis of the Beijing Heavy Industry School of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry. In addition, a tractor manufacturing school has been newly established in Beijing. Shanxi Province has separately established five schools of mechanical manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, chemistry, and civil engineering on the basis of the First and Second Industrial Schools. The newly built schools are the Mining Industry School and the Water Conservancy Engineering School. Among the 31 schools in North China, excluding comprehensive schools, there are 20 heavy industry schools and 4 light industry schools.

In order to facilitate production practice and receive leadership, these schools are located near factories, mines and relevant business departments. In order to train a large number of personnel, the scale of each school is relatively large, with a development scale of 900 to 1,500 students per school. During the summer vacation this year, industrial technical schools in the North China region enrolled more than 8,000 new students. Currently, the total number of students in the schools is more than 80% higher than in the first half of this year.

The study period for students in industrial technical schools in North China is generally set at three years. In order to strengthen the connection between theory and practice, the teaching practice time of each school is set at six weeks, and the production practice time is set at sixteen weeks. This enables students to master the practical skills of workshop organization and production work through practice.

Following the adjustment and rectification of industrial technical schools, other types of technical schools in North China will also undergo comprehensive adjustment and rectification next year.

At the same time as carrying out the adjustment work, the industrial technical schools in North China have also carried out a series of reforms in teaching content. The Central Ministry of Education absorbed the advanced experience of industrial technical schools in the Soviet Union, and with the specific help of Soviet experts, formulated and promulgated the trial teaching plans for general courses and basic courses in industrial technical schools; in order to further unify and reform the curriculum content, the Central Ministry of Education also translated the teaching outlines of general courses and basic technical courses of industrial technical schools in the Soviet Union, and these teaching plans and teaching outlines have been adopted by industrial technical schools in North China. In terms of teaching materials, the current policy is to focus on translation. For general courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, the schools will refer to the Soviet ten-year middle school textbooks compiled and translated by the Northeast Ministry of Education for teaching.

The industrial technical schools in North China, after adjustment, have overcome the past phenomena of unclear training objectives and teaching divorced from reality, and are gradually moving towards specialization and singularity, and can effectively train various professional talents according to the actual needs of national construction. At the same time, due to the concentration of human and material resources after the adjustment, the teaching effect has also been significantly improved. The leadership of relevant business departments at all levels has also been greatly strengthened, such as in the aspect of equipment for internships and the allocation of teachers and cadres, the schools have been given the greatest help.

    华北区工业性质中等技术学校已初步调整
    为培养国家工业建设所需要的大量中级技术人材，华北区工业性质的中等技术学校已进行了初步的调整和整顿。
    华北区工业性质的中等技术学校三年来已有了相当的发展。一九五零年下半年，工业性质的中等技术学校仅七所，学生三千三百多人。到今年上半年，工业性质的中等技术学校已发展到二十二所，学生达到一万人。但是，这些学校不论在数量上或质量上都远不能适应实际需要，特别是重工业学校的数量和规模距离实际需要很远。为了改变这种情况，使中等技术学校具有明确的培养目标，并根据业务部门生产的需要设置专业，大量地培养技术人材，就必须大力进行调整和整顿。
    华北区工业性质中等技术学校的调整和整顿，是以已有的工业性质中等技术学校为基础，根据中央有关工业部门所提供的三、五年内华北区工业建设的重点、分布情况及华北区各省市地方工业建设对中等技术干部的需要，在全区范围内统筹进行的。经过调整和整顿，华北全区现有工业性质的中等技术学校三十一所，较调整和整顿前增加了九所。除北京、天津、河北、归绥、张家口等地的一部分工业学校确定为一般机械、电机、化工及纺织工业的综合性工业学校外，其他学校都趋向专业化和单一化。例如以中央人民政府重工业部北京重工业学校为基础成立了新的钢铁学校和机器制造学校。另外在北京又新建立了拖拉机制造学校。山西省在第一和第二工业学校基础上，分别单独成立了机械制造、采矿、冶金、化学、土木工程等五校。完全新建的学校有采矿工业学校和水利工程学校。华北区三十一所学校中除综合性学校外，重工业学校共有二十所，轻工业学校共四所。
    为了便于进行生产实习和接受领导，这些学校都设立在靠近厂、矿和有关业务部门的地方。为了大量培养人材，各校规模都较大，每个学校的发展规模为九百到一千五百学生。全区工业性质的中等技术学校今年暑期招收了八千多名新生，目前各校在校学生的总和比今年上半年增加了百分之八十以上。
    华北区工业性质的中等技术学校学生学习期限一般定为三年。为了加强理论和实际的联系，各校教学实习时间定为六周，生产实习时间定为十六周。这样便使学生能从实践中掌握车间组织生产工作的实际技能。
    继工业性质的中等技术学校调整和整顿后，华北区其他性质的中等技术学校明年也将进行全面的调整和整顿。
    和进行调整工作同时，华北区各工业性质的中等技术学校在教学内容方面，也进行了一系列的改革工作。中央教育部吸取苏联工业性质中等技术学校的先进经验，在苏联专家的具体帮助下，制订和公布了工业性质中等技术学校的普通课、基础课的试行教学计划；为进一步统一和改革课程内容，中央教育部并翻译了苏联工业性质中等技术学校普通课、基础技术课的教学大纲，这些教学计划和教学大纲，华北区工业性质的中等技术学校已经采用。教材方面，目前采取以翻译为主的方针，普通课如数学、物理、化学，各校将参考东北教育部编译的苏联十年制中学教材进行教学。
    经过调整的华北区各工业性质的中等技术学校，已克服了过去培养目标不明确和教学脱离实际的现象，逐步地走上专业化、单一化，并能按照国家建设的实际需要，有效地培养各种专业人材。同时，由于调整后人力、物力的集中，教学效果也有了显著的提高。各级有关业务部门对学校的领导，也都大大加强，如在实习设备和师资、干部的配备方面，均给了学校以最大的帮助。（据新华社讯）
