In Hainan Administrative Region, the phenomenon of certain organs resisting mass criticism and disregarding newspaper readers' letters is very serious. From January to October this year, Xin Hainan Bao published criticism and suggestion submissions and forwarded 452 reader letters to relevant organs for handling and reply, which went unanswered. Even more serious, a few units openly resisted criticism and even investigated or retaliated against letter writers. For example, Xin Hainan Bao published a report in 1951 from correspondent Huang Xianqian criticizing Chen Huanan, director of the Yunlilu office in Haikou City’s Fucheng, for forcing residents like Chen Zhenyong to increase their donation amounts. Chen Huanan not only did not examine his mistakes but also threatened Huang Xianqian's elderly mother and Chen Zhenyong, forcing them to write statements to the newspaper for "correction." After this incident, Xin Hainan Bao immediately notified the Haikou Municipal People's Government of the details, requesting that it supervise Chen Huanan's self-criticism and take appropriate action. Subsequent reminders were also made on several occasions. However, the Haikou Municipal People's Government has not yet responded. Another example is Xin Hainan Bao published a reader's letter from Lin Xiuming on September 3, 1951, criticizing the Hainan Island Branch of the People's Bank for using parades to promote prize-linked savings, which would diminish the political significance of prize-linked savings. This criticism was correct, but the leading comrades of the Hainan Island Branch did not humbly examine the shortcomings in their work but instead resisted criticism and refused to admit their mistake. Li Mei, a staff member of the branch, even went directly to the newspaper office to investigate the reader's letter. Xin Hainan Bao sent a letter to the branch, requesting a reply to the reader's criticism, but the branch ignored it. This behavior seriously violates the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People," and must be resolutely corrected.

On November 20, Xin Hainan Bao, representing the opinions of its readers, filed a complaint with the Hainan District Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and the Hainan Administrative Office's People's Supervision Committee regarding the problem of certain organs in Hainan accumulating reader letters and resisting criticism. The complaint listed the facts of certain organs in Hainan resisting criticism and disregarding reader letters and made two demands:

(1) The relevant organs and individuals that have not responded to the criticisms and suggestions published in the newspaper and the reader letters forwarded for handling and reply should respond within a certain period. Those stationed in Haikou City are limited to five days; those stationed in other counties are limited to ten, fifteen, twenty-five, or thirty days respectively, depending on the distance from Haikou City.

(2) All levels of organs should conduct a summary self-criticism of their handling of newspaper criticisms and reader letters for the past year before December 20.

In the complaint, the newspaper also requested that the organs and individuals that seriously accumulated letters and resisted criticism be inspected and dealt with and that effective measures be taken to correct them.

Xin Hainan Bao published the full text of this complaint on November 22, along with a list of the relevant organs that had not responded to the criticisms and suggestions published in the newspaper and the reader letters forwarded for handling and reply.

The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Hainan District Committee replied to Xin Hainan Bao on November 24, expressing its full support for the demands of Xin Hainan Bao and believing that this demand was not only completely necessary but also very urgent. The reply also pointed out that disregarding reader letters and resisting criticism is an unorganized and undisciplined erroneous behavior that violates the decisions of the Party and the instructions of the government, and is an extremely bad bureaucratic style. If this behavior and style are not immediately corrected, it cannot be tolerated by Party discipline. Therefore, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Hainan District Committee decided to directly urge the relevant organs to conduct inspections and also telegraphed the relevant county party committees, Haikou City Party Committee, and discipline inspection committees of Hainan's directly subordinate organs to immediately convene meetings for inspection; the relevant organs and individuals should respond within the period required by Xin Hainan Bao; all levels of organs should conduct a summary self-criticism of their handling of newspaper criticisms and reader letters for the past year before December 20; and those who have made mistakes should be given the appropriate Party disciplinary action. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Hainan District Committee also requested that every Communist Party member and every Party organization attach importance to the criticisms and suggestions of the people, and humbly accept the criticisms and suggestions of the masses with a spirit of self-criticism, examine and correct the shortcomings and errors in their work.

    海南某些机关漠视和抗拒报纸的读者批评
    新海南报向海南党政领导机关提出申诉
    要求各有关机关在一定期间内答复并作出总结性的检讨
    海南行政区某些机关抗拒群众批评，漠视报纸读者来信的现象非常严重。新海南报今年一月到十月发表的批评建议稿件和转交各有关机关处理答复的读者来信，有四百五十二件未获答复。更严重的是，少数单位竟公开抗拒批评，甚至追查或报复写信人。如新海南报在一九五一年发表通讯员黄显谦批评海口市府城云里路办事处主任陈焕南强迫居民陈振镛等增加捐献数字的稿件。陈焕南不仅不检讨自己的错误，反而对黄显谦的老母和陈振镛等进行威胁，强迫他们写声明到报社“更正”。此事发生后，新海南报即将事情经过通知海口市人民政府，要求督促陈焕南检讨，并作适当处理。其后并曾多次催促。但海口市人民政府至今仍未答复。又如新海南报在一九五一年九月三日发表读者林秀明的来信，批评人民银行海南岛分行用游行送奖的方式宣传有奖储蓄，会降低有奖储蓄的政治意义。这一批评是正确的，但海南岛分行领导同志不虚心检讨工作中的缺点，反而抗拒批评，不肯认错。该行工作人员李梅竟直接到报社追查读者来信。新海南报曾函请该分行对读者的批评作出答复，但该分行一直置之不理。这种行为，严重地违反了中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”和中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，必须坚决予以纠正。
    十一月二十日，新海南报代表读者意见，就海南各地某些机关积压读者来信抗拒批评的问题，向中共海南区党委纪律检查委员会和海南行政公署人民监察委员会提出申诉。申诉书列举了海南某些机关抗拒批评和漠视读者来信的事实，并提出两项要求：
    （一）对报纸发表的批评建议及转请处理答复的读者来信未予答复的各有关机关和个人，应在一定期限内作出答复。驻在海口市者限五日；驻在其他各县者，按距离海口市的远近，分别限十日、十五日、二十五日、三十日内答复。
    （二）各级机关在十二月二十日前作出一年来处理报纸批评和读者来信的总结性的检讨。
    该报在申诉书中并请求对严重积压来信、抗拒批评的机关和个人，进行检查处理，并采取有效措施加以纠正。
    新海南报在十一月二十二日刊载了这一申诉书的全文和对报纸发表的批评与建议及转往请处理答复的读者来信未予答复的有关机关的名单。
    中共海南区党委纪律检查委员会于十一月二十四日函复新海南报，表示完全支持新海南报的要求，并认为这一要求不但完全必要，而且非常迫切。复信中并指出：漠视读者来信，抗拒批评，是违反党的决定和政府指示的无组织无纪律的错误行为，是极端恶劣的官僚主义作风。这种行为和作风如不立即纠正，是党纪不能容许的。因此中共海南区党委纪律检查委员会决定，除直接督促各有关机关检查外，并电有关的各县委、海口市委、海南一级直属机关党委的纪律检查委员会，立即召开会议进行检查；有关机关和个人应在新海南报要求的期间内作出答复；各级机关在十二月二十日前应作出一年处理报纸批评和读者来信的总结性的检讨；对犯错误者应分别给以应得的党纪处分。中共海南区党委纪律检查委员会并要求每一个共产党员和每一个党的组织重视人民群众的批评和建议，要以自我批评的精神虚心接受群众的批评建议，检讨和纠正工作中的缺点和错误。
