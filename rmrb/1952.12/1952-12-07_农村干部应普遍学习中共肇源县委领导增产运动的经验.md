    Rural Cadres Should Universally Learn from the Experience of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee in Leading the Production Increase Movement

    The experience of the CCP Heilongjiang Province Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading the production increase movement (see page 2 of this newspaper, October 18th) has attracted the attention of many rural work cadres in Heilongjiang Province and other regions. They have earnestly studied this experience and used it as a weapon to examine and improve their work. This is very necessary.

    However, it must be pointed out that many rural work cadres in various regions do not pay enough attention to the experience of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading the production increase movement. They either believe that although Zhaoyuan's experience is very good, it is only the experience of a local area; or they believe that Zhaoyuan's experience has nothing to learn from at all.

    Of course, the technical experience promoted by the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee is only applicable to areas with extensive cultivation. However, the experience of the Zhaoyuan County Committee in specifically applying the working method of "from the masses, to the masses" and summarizing and promoting advanced farming methods of farmers is of great significance to rural work cadres in all regions. A lack of sensitivity to new things in farmers' production and life, and a reluctance to go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, are still common among many rural cadres, which is the main reason why their work ability cannot be rapidly improved. Learning from the leadership experience of the Zhaoyuan County Committee is very beneficial to these comrades.

    At present, various localities are summarizing the experience of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic production increase movement. In this summary work, if we can seriously study Zhaoyuan's experience and use this experience to conduct in-depth inspections of our work, this will be of great benefit to improving and improving our work, as well as to the large-scale production movement next year.

### 农村干部应普遍学习中共肇源县委领导增产运动的经验

    农村干部应普遍学习中共肇源县委领导增产运动的经验
    中共黑龙江省肇源县委领导增产运动的经验（见本报十月十八日第二版），已引起黑龙江省及其他地区许多农村工作干部的重视。他们对这个经验进行了认真的学习，并把这个经验作为武器来检查和改进自己的工作。这是十分必要的。
    但是必须指出，许多地区的农村工作干部对中共肇源县委领导增产运动的经验还是重视不够的。他们或者认为肇源的经验虽然很好，但只不过是一个局部地区的经验；或者认为肇源的经验根本没有什么可学习的。
    当然，中共肇源县委推广的技术经验，只能适用于耕作粗放的地区。但是肇源县委具体运用从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法，总结和推广农民的先进耕作方法的经验，对于各个地区的农村工作干部，都是有巨大作用的。对农民生产、生活中的新鲜事物缺乏敏感，和不善于深入群众进行调查研究的作风，在许多农村干部中还普遍地存在着，这就是他们的工作能力不能迅速提高的主要原因。学习肇源县委的领导经验，对这些同志是非常有益的。
    目前各地正在总结互助合作运动和爱国丰产运动的经验。在这次总结工作中，如果能认真学习肇源县的经验，并运用这个经验来深入检查工作，这对提高和改进工作，以及对明年的大生产运动，都会有很大的好处。
