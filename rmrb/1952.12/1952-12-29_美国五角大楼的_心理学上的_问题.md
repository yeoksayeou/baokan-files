    The "Psychological" Problems of the U.S. Pentagon
    by Saslavsky, Soviet Union
    There's an old joke that goes like this: a general asks,
    "Colonel, why aren't your men firing?"
    "Sir, first, they have no ammunition. Second,..."
    "Colonel, say no more."
    The American commander in Korea cannot give such a simple answer. His soldiers have plenty of ammunition of all kinds. However, the extremely reactionary American magazine "Collier's" published an article on November 8 entitled "Why Half Our Frontline Soldiers Don't Fire," written by its reporter Bill Davidson.
    Davidson said he had discussed the issue with scientists, military historians, and commanders and junior officers who had just returned from the front in Korea, and "they almost all talked about the same thing."
    For example, Sergeant Nicholas Smith said, "Sometimes you send a squad to cover a flank, and nine rifles should be firing, but you only hear two or three firing."
    Sergeant Thomas McGrath also said:
    "In Korea, out of my nine-man squad, I never heard more than four or five firing, even in battles that saved their lives."
    Here is another witness, Sergeant John Williams: "It happened more than once that I had to repeatedly expose myself, crawling from foxhole to foxhole, urging half of my team to fire."
    Davidson also cited another typical example, saying that a squad from the U.S. Army's 38th Infantry Regiment was sent out on an important mission, and the result was that "they were all wiped out... returning with almost all of their ammunition unused."
    Based on the results of his investigation, Davidson believes that half, perhaps more than half, of U.S. soldiers do not fire in combat. He cites the authoritative opinion of Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall, an expert in this field. It is said that General Marshall is "recognized as the first to discover the phenomenon of collective non-firing." General Marshall is extremely troubled by this and is investigating the causes of this problem, seeking to cure it.
    We have heard news that the United States has established special agencies to study the reasons for the low combat effectiveness of the U.S. military. For example, Davidson tells us that the United States has an "Operations Research Bureau," filled with so-called "high-level" mathematics experts, psychology experts, and psychiatrists. What have they found? So far, there is no conclusion. Davidson tells us, "All that can be done is a lot of good conjecture. But until now, no one can say we have a definite opinion."
    Indeed, there are many, many "conjectures"—first, second, and so on. However, these "conjectures" all have a certain ideological odor—an odor ten times worse than Hitlerism.
    Let the reader judge for themselves. Davidson says the first is:
    "Psychiatrists point out that a person's failure to fire in combat can be traced back to the repressive forces they encountered in infancy. Every child is born with aggressiveness. But this impulse to commit violence is soon stopped by the family."
    In other words, according to these so-called American "experts," American citizens can become ideal soldiers when they are still babbling and rocking in their cradles. It seems that it would be great if they could maintain this infantile state throughout their lives; but, unfortunately, they begin to deteriorate.
    Second is the family. The family inhibits the child's homicidal nature. Under this influence, "the child's mind often unconsciously suppresses his desire to kill." Here, Davidson omits something that should be mentioned: in the United States, this family influence is also being countered. Countless detective novels and movies glorify murderers and bandits, and worship violence and robbery. "Collier's" magazine vigorously promotes slaughter in both pictures and words! It is precisely this kind of literature that feeds the American soldiers invading Korea. The question arises, the heroes in the films keep firing, but the soldiers are still trembling and not firing. What's going on? Davidson does not explain this.
    Third, there are many churches that teach people: "Thou shalt not kill!" However, "Collier's" magazine contradicts itself here. Davidson had talked to several pastors. One said, "In a life-and-death duel, it is sometimes necessary to tear away the veil of morality and civilization from a person's soul, exposing the beastliness hidden within." So, in any case, the church should not be blamed.
    In fact, the U.S. military command in Korea, with the help of its "scientists," pastors, and journalists, has been striving for more than two years to
    "expose beastliness." It incites its soldiers to persecute peaceful and defenseless residents, cultivate their bestial behavior, and stimulate their animal nature. However, these beasts on the battlefield often tuck their tails between their legs, and their embarrassed state is fully exposed.
    Fourth, U.S. soldiers have not been completely controlled by the so-called "mob psychology," feeling that they still have personal existence, and therefore, they are afraid and do not want to fight. Therefore, what should be done is to educate the soldiers into an ignorant and uninformed mass, ideas about the purpose of the war should be completely banished from the soldiers' minds, and they should be turned into complete bandits.
    What has been said above is precisely what the U.S. military has been doing since the beginning of the war. U.S. soldiers are constantly threatened by military discipline and numbed by various kinds of propaganda, and their personal will and personal dignity have been completely strangled in their hearts. However, he still doesn't fire, or fires very badly. Why? Is it because the war has restored rather than banished his will, and he doesn't plan to be muddled any further? This is a very natural question, but Davidson does not dare to easily touch it.
    Fifth, it is said that U.S. soldiers don't shout enough during combat, which is why they don't fire. This is an astonishing discovery that should be carefully considered.
    This is also the discovery of General Marshall.
    He stated his reasons, saying: "Let them shout, shouting is important because when people shout, they will realize that they are one of a group, and no longer a pitiful, lonely individual; it can stimulate a chain reaction, a reaction that can turn sheep into lions on the battlefield."
    We know that this clever suggestion has been adopted by the U.S. military command in Korea. Davidson wrote happily, "Today we have a shouting and clamoring army." As soon as the order is given, "the soldiers shout, sometimes with inappropriate shouts like college students cheering and applauding—sometimes, they shout some abusive words in Chinese."
    If the soldiers also mixed in some words scolding their commanders and smart advisors in their usual shouts, these "abusive words" would not be as "inappropriate" as Davidson thought; he would listen seriously and carefully to what the soldiers were shouting. However, the main point remains that there is plenty of shouting, but the military results remain the same.
    Obviously, General Marshall's discovery is nothing new. He is simply using materials from the means used in Indian tribal warfare during the period when the American continent was discovered long ago. Indians not only shouted loudly to scare the enemy during combat, but also wore masks to dress themselves up more fiercely. Perhaps this general also intends to introduce the use of such masks to improve the morale of the U.S. military?
    Sixth—enough! The bottom line of all these "whys" and "becauses" is crystal clear. This is not something new, but an old trick copied from the fascist military ideology of Hitler's Germany. According to this ideology, man is only a beast by nature, and an ideal soldier is one who develops this bestiality to the extreme. Hitler's bandits educated their soldiers to use violence, robbery, plunder, and harm unarmed civilians, exterminate the entire population, and engage in the most barbaric atrocities—they considered that they had trained an invincible and most powerful army in the world. Yes, they were indeed powerful when they only encountered weak resistance. In Western Europe, this army robbed, slaughtered, and committed crimes without being punished. But when it encountered a superior army—the Soviet army—it was defeated, annihilated, and finished.
    Why?
    Because the ideology of the Soviet army is that man is not a beast, but rational, and he can fulfill his highest responsibility when he fights to defend the free socialist motherland. On February 23, 1942, Stalin wrote: "Every Red Army soldier can proudly declare that he is waging a just, liberating war, a war to defend the freedom and independence of the motherland."
    What made up Hitler's army were people who had been turned into beasts. Beasts are cruel—but cruelty is not courage. The general rule is that beasts are cowardly and afraid of humans.
    What makes up the army of the free Korean people are people, patriots, who know why they are fighting; for the freedom and independence of their motherland, they are prepared to dedicate their lives. Korean soldiers still fire when facing American troops several times their size. When they enter the battle, they do not shout any "inappropriate" "abusive words"; what they shout on the battlefield is the most proud slogan: "For our motherland!"
    The American journalist fills his zoo-like magazine with
    "whys" and "becauses" because he does not dare to answer the question simply and directly: why the U.S. military is defeated in Korea. Yes, why do U.S. soldiers shoot so badly and fight so poorly in Korea? There was a clear answer almost two years ago. In February 1951, Stalin said in response to questions from a "Pravda" reporter:
    "It is clear that even the most experienced generals and officers will fail if the soldiers believe that the war they are forced to wage is extremely unjust, if the soldiers therefore only formally perform their duties on the front lines, neither believing that their mission is just nor having enthusiasm."
    A war based on the violence of imperialists, a war of conquest and plunder, cannot be popular. An army built on this kind of "ideology" cannot be powerful. American bourgeois journalists who glorify killing and violence, equating bandits with soldiers, have made no small mistake. True, bandits are as cruel as beasts, but their cowardice is also like beasts. The entire philosophy of American imperialists is to turn people into a flock of sheep, or to turn people into a flock of beasts. However, neither of these situations is a powerful expression, but rather a sign of weakness. American imperialists, who are politically and morally bankrupt, cannot increase the courage of U.S. soldiers to fight for the profits of a handful of robbers who own billions of dollars. It is obvious that U.S. soldiers are also gradually understanding that what he is doing is base and meaningless, and that he is being sent down the road of unnecessary death. He can only reluctantly obey orders under coercion. Look, how can there be any courage in his lonely soul!
    This not only explains why the American military strategy in the Korean mountains has suffered an inevitable defeat; but also explains why the barbaric and violent ideology of American imperialism—an ideology that has already been proven by Hitler's failure—is also bound to fail.

### 美国五角大楼的“心理学上的”问题

    美国五角大楼的“心理学上的”问题
    苏联　萨斯拉夫斯基
    有一个古老的笑话这样说，将军问道：
    “上校，为什么你的部下不开枪射击？”
    “大人，第一，他们没有军火。第二，……”
    “上校，你不要再说下去了。”
    在朝鲜的美军司令是不能作出这样简单的回答的。它的士兵们有着充足的各式各样的军火。然而，反动透顶的美国“柯里尔”杂志，却在十一月八日刊出了一篇“为什么我们的前线士兵有一半不开枪射击”的文章，作者是它的记者毕尔·戴维逊。
    戴维逊说，他曾同科学家、军事历史学家以及刚从朝鲜前线回来的部队指挥官和下级军官们讨论过这个问题，并且，“他们几乎都谈到同样的事。”
    例如，尼古拉斯·史密斯班长说：“有时你派一班人去掩护侧翼，应该有九枝步枪开火，而你听到的只是两三枝步枪在放。”
    汤玛斯·麦克格拉斯军曹也这样说：
    “在朝鲜，我这个班九个人，从来没有听到他们中有四、五个人以上开枪的，即使在挽救他们的生命的战斗中也无例外。”
    下面是另外一个见证人——约翰·威廉姆斯班长的话：“这样的情况就不止一次了，我不得不一再暴露自己，从这个散兵坑爬到那个散兵坑，督促我那一队一半的人开枪。”
    戴维逊还举出了另外一个典型例子，说的是美军步兵第三十八团的一个班派出去执行重要任务，结果是“全垮了……带去的军火几乎一点也没有用就回来了。”
    戴维逊根据调查的结果，相信美军士兵中有一半，也许一半以上，在战斗中是不放枪的。他引证了这一方面的专家马霞尔准将的权威意见。据说，这位马霞尔将军是“公认的第一个发现集体不开火现象的人”。马霞尔将军对此烦恼异常，并且正在调查产生这种毛病的原因，设法治疗。
    我们听到了这样的消息：美国已成立特别机构来研究美军战斗效率低下的原因。例如，戴维逊就告诉我们，美国有一个“作战研究局”，局内有的是所谓“高级”的数学专家，心理学专家和精神病治疗专家。他们找到了些什么呢？到现在为止，还没有什么定论。戴维逊告诉我们说：“尽力之所能做到的只是许多好的臆测。但是直到现在为止，没有一个人能够说我们已经有了确定的意见。”
    诚然，“臆测”是很多很多的——第一，第二，等等。不过，这些“臆测”都有一定的思想气味——比希特勒主义还臭十倍的气味。
    请读者自己来判断一下吧。戴维逊说，第一是：
    “精神病治疗专家指出，一个人在战斗中不放枪这件事可以一直追溯到一个人在婴儿时期所遭到的遏制作用。每一个孩子都是生来就带有侵略性的。但是他的这种从事暴行的冲动不久就受到家庭的阻止。”
    换句话说，根据这些所谓美国“专家”的意见，美国公民还在呀呀学语、还在摇篮里摆来摆去的时候就能够成为一个理想的兵士了。这样看来，假使他能终生保持这种婴儿状态，那就太好了；可是，遗憾的很，他开始变坏了。
    第二，就是家庭。家庭制止了儿童的嗜杀本性。在这种影响下，“儿童的心理常常是不自觉地要压抑自己的杀人欲望”。在这里，有些该提到的事情，戴维逊却把它漏掉了，那就是在美国，这种家庭影响也正在受到反击，无数的侦探小说和电影，都在歌颂杀人犯和盗匪，崇拜暴力和劫掠。“柯里尔”杂志无论在图片中或在文字中都在大力宣传屠杀！把侵朝美军士兵喂饱的也正是这种文学作品。问题就来了，影片上的英雄们打枪打个不停，而士兵们却依然是胆战心惊不放枪。这是怎么一回事呢？戴维逊对此没有解释。
    第三，有许多教堂，它们教导人们：“汝不应杀戮！”不过，“柯里尔”杂志在这里自相矛盾了。戴维逊曾和几位牧师谈论过。一位说：“在一个生死决斗中，有时很有必要从人的灵魂中揭开道德和文明的帷幕，暴露出隐藏在里面的兽性来。”所以，无论如何，教堂也不应受到什么责备。
    事实上，朝鲜美军司令部，在它的“科学家”、牧师和新闻记者帮助之下，两年多来一直在努力
    “暴露兽性”。它煽动它的士兵们迫害和平的和无防卫能力的居民，培养他们的野兽行径，激发他们的野兽本性。然而，在战场上的这些野兽常常是夹住尾巴，其狼狈情形可谓暴露无遗。
    第四，美军士兵还没有完全为所谓“暴众心理”所控制，认为他仍然感觉到个人的存在，因而，他害怕，不想打仗。所以，应该做的事就是把士兵们教育成无知无识的一群，有关战争目的的想法应从士兵的头脑中驱逐净尽，并把他们变成十足的盗匪。
    上面说的，正是战争开始以来美军已经在做的事。美军士兵经常受到军纪的威胁和各式各样宣传的麻醉，在他的内心中个人意志和个人尊严已完全被扼杀了。不过，他还是不开枪，或则开得很坏。为什么呢？难道是因为战争恢复了而不是驱逐了他的意志，并且他不打算再昏头昏脑下去了吗？这是一个很自然的问题，戴维逊却不敢轻易地去接触它。
    第五，据说，美军士兵在作战时喊叫得不够，这就是为什么他们不开火的道理。这是一个惊人的发现，应该好好考虑考虑。
    这还是那位马霞尔将军的发现。
    他申述他的理由说：“让他们大喊大叫吧，大喊大叫所以重要，是因为人们一喊叫就会明白自己是一堆人中的一个，而不再是可怜的孤孤单单的一个人了；它能够激起一种连锁反应，这种反应是能在战场上把绵羊变成狮子的。”
    我们知道，这一个聪明的建议已为朝鲜美军司令部采用。戴维逊很愉快地写道：“今天我们已经有了一支大叫大吵的军队了”。只要命令一下，“士兵们就叫，有时是像大学生欢呼鼓掌一样的不得体的叫喊——有时，就是用中国话喊些骂人的话。”
    假使，士兵们在通常的喊叫声中也杂入了一些斥责他们的指挥官和聪明的顾问们的话，这种“骂人的话”就不会像戴维逊所想的那么“不得体”了；他会认真而仔细地去听听士兵们喊些什么的。不过，主要之点仍然是，大喊大叫也够多了，而军事结果呢，却依然如旧。
    很明显，马霞尔将军的发现毫无新鲜之处。他用的材料只不过是在很久以前发现美洲大陆时期印第安部落战争中所用的手段而已。印第安人在作战时不仅大声喊叫以吓唬敌人，还带上面具把自己装扮得更凶恶。也许，这位将军也打算介绍使用这种面具以提高美军士气吗？
    第六——真是够了！所有这些“为什么”以及“所以”的底子都是一清二楚的了。这并不是什么新东西，而是抄袭了希特勒德国法西斯军事思想的旧货色。根据这种思想，人在本性上只是一只野兽，把这种兽性发挥到极点的就是一个理想的士兵。希特勒匪徒教育他们的士兵去使用暴力，抢劫，掠夺并残害非武装平民，灭绝所有的人口，从事最野蛮的暴行——他们自认为他们训练了一支举世无敌的最强大的军队。是的，当他们遇到的只是微弱的抵抗时，他们确是强大的。在西欧，这支军队就曾抢劫过，屠杀过，作了罪犯而没有受到惩处。但是当它碰到一支优越的军队——苏军时，它就被打败了，被歼灭了，完蛋了。
    为什么？
    因为苏军的思想是这样的，这种思想教导说：人并不是野兽，而是有理性的，在他为保卫自由的社会主义祖国而战时，他能够尽到最高的责任。一九四二年二月二十三日，斯大林写道：“任何一个红军战士都能自豪地声言说，他是进行着正义的，解放的战争，进行着捍卫祖国自由独立的战争。”
    组成希特勒军队的，是已经变成了野兽的人。野兽是残忍的——但是残忍并不就是勇敢。一般的规律是这样的，野兽怯懦，并且害怕人类。
    组成自由朝鲜人民的军队的，是人，是爱国者，他们知道为何而战；为了祖国的自由和独立，他们准备献出自己的生命。朝鲜士兵面对几倍于他的美军时，照样开枪射击。他们进入战阵时并不是喊着什么“不得体”的“骂人的话”；他们在战场上喊的是最值得骄傲的口号：“为了我们的祖国！”
    美国新闻记者在他的动物园似的杂志上堆满了
    “为什么”和“所以”，就因为他不敢简明而直接地回答这样一个问题：为什么美军在朝鲜吃败仗。是的，为什么美军士兵在朝鲜射击得很坏战斗得很差呢？差不多两年以前就已经有了明明白白的答案。一九五一年二月，斯大林在答复“真理报”记者的问题时说到：
    “这是很清楚的，如果士兵们认为强迫他们进行的战争是极端非正义的，如果士兵们因此而在前线上只是形式上执行职务，既不相信他们的使命合乎正义，也没有热情，那末就是最有经验的将领和军官也要失败的。”
    一个以帝国主义者的暴力为基础的战争，一个征服和掠夺的战争，不可能是得人心的。在这种“思想”基础上建立的军队也不可能是强有力的。歌颂杀戮和暴力的美国资产阶级新闻记者们，把盗匪和士兵同等看待，这样他们就犯下了不小的错误了。不错，盗匪是残忍如野兽，然而其怯懦也正如野兽。美国帝国主义者的全部哲学就是把人们变成一群绵羊，或则把人们变成一群野兽。然而，这两种情况的任何一种都不是强有力的表示，毋宁说是软弱无力的标志。在政治上和道义上都已破产了的美国帝国主义者不可能提高美军士兵的勇气去为一小撮占有亿万美元的强盗的利润而作战。很明显，美军士兵们也正在逐渐明白他作的事是卑贱的，毫无意义的，他被送到了不必要的死亡的道路上。他只能在威逼之下勉强地服从命令。看看吧，在他的孤独的灵魂中怎么能有什么勇敢呢！
    这不仅仅说明了在朝鲜山地中为什么美国的军事战略遭到了不可避免的失败；而且也说明了为什么美帝国主义的野蛮暴力思想——业已由希特勒的失败而证明了的一种思想，也必然要遭到失败。
