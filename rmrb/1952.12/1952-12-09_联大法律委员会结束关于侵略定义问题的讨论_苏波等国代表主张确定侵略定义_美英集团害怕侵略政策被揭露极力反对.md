TASS report: The Sixth (Legal) Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has concluded its discussion on the question of defining aggression.

As previously reported, on November 21, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a speech to the committee, using examples to demonstrate the need for the United Nations to adopt a definition of aggression and exposing the real reasons why the bloc of aggressive countries headed by the United States refused to adopt a definition of aggression.

In subsequent meetings of the committee, Polish representative Professor Lachs, representative of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Povidev, and head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Sekaninova, all emphasized that the United Nations has an obligation to define aggression.

The Polish representative emphasized that the Soviet definition of aggression has great international significance. He said: This definition has become part of international law, has been incorporated into many treaties, and is a major contribution to the development of international law. The Polish representative cited many examples proving that the Soviet definition of aggression has stood the test of time and is now a major weapon in the struggle for peace. The Polish representative pointed out that if the definition of aggression proposed in the Soviet proposal were adopted, it would be a serious warning to aggressors.

Representatives from Afghanistan, Iran, Bolivia, and some other countries, in their speeches, advocated for defining aggression, pointing out that this would ease international tensions.

The representatives of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc headed by the United States vigorously disrupted the committee, opposing the definition of aggression. Their speeches proved that they deeply feared that the aggression policies of the US-UK bloc would be exposed and condemned. The representatives of the United States and Britain distorted historical facts and made unfounded slander against the Soviet Union, attempting to conceal their opposition to defining aggression without any arguments.

Vyshinsky delivered a lengthy speech to the committee on December 4.

Everyone listened attentively to the speech of the head of the Soviet delegation, and his speech aroused enthusiastic reactions among many representatives.

The representative of Ecuador then spoke, saying: We cannot agree with the opinions of those who oppose defining aggression; the United Nations can and should adopt such a definition. He said that adopting a negative attitude towards defining aggression would certainly lead to arbitrary behavior in international relations. He urged the committee to further study the question of defining aggression and criticized the objections of the representatives of those countries that opposed defining aggression. The representative of Ecuador went on to say that if a definition of aggression had been adopted in time in the past, we would have avoided certain tragic historical events. Passing a definition of aggression is extremely important for small countries. He also proposed submitting the above issues to the committee for further consideration.

As the meeting drew to a close, the representatives of Sweden and France tried hard to defend themselves.

Vyshinsky quoted the words of the Swedish representative at a previous meeting of the committee, pointing out that the Swedish representative could not shirk the blame for slander. In replying to the French representative, Vyshinsky cited documents proving that the French ruling clique, under the cover of the non-aggression treaty concluded with the Soviet Union, assisted Finnish fascists in fighting against the Soviet Union in 1939 and 1940, and proving that the French ruling clique at that time was preparing to send an expeditionary force to Finland in order to invade the Soviet Union.

The committee then adjourned. The committee will begin discussing the proposed proposals at its next meeting.

    联大法律委员会结束关于侵略定义问题的讨论
    苏波等国代表主张确定侵略定义
    美英集团害怕侵略政策被揭露极力反对
    据塔斯社讯：联合国大会第六（法律）委员会已将关于侵略的定义的问题讨论完毕。
    前已报道，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于十一月二十一日在委员会中发表了一篇演说，以实例证明了联合国需要通过一个关于侵略的定义，并揭穿了以美国为首的侵略国家集团拒绝通过一个侵略的定义的真正的理由。
    在委员会以后的会议上，波兰代表拉赫斯教授，白俄罗斯共和国代表波维杰夫和捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃都强调说：联合国有义务给侵略下一个定义。
    波兰代表强调指出：苏联给侵略所下的定义具有重大的国际意义。他说：这个定义已经变成国际法的一部分，被列入许多条约中，对国际法的发展是一个重大的贡献。波兰代表列举了许多例子，证明苏联对侵略的定义经受了时代的考验，现在是为和平而斗争的一个主要的武器。波兰代表指出：倘若通过苏联的提案中所提出的侵略的定义，对侵略者们将是一个严重的警告。
    阿富汗、伊朗、玻利维亚和其他一些国家的代表们发言时都主张替侵略下一个定义，他们指出：这会使国际紧张局势缓和下来。
    以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团的代表们在委员会中极力捣乱，反对给侵略下定义。他们的演说证明了他们深怕美英集团的侵略政策会被揭露出来，受到谴责。美国和英国的代表们歪曲历史的事实，对苏联妄加诋毁，打算借此掩饰他们没有任何论据就反对给侵略下定义的行为。
    维辛斯基于十二月四日在委员会中发表长篇演说。
    大家全神贯注地静听苏联代表团团长的演说，他的演说在许多代表中间引起了热烈的反应。
    厄瓜多尔代表接着发言，他说：我们不能同意那些反对确定侵略定义的人们的意见，联合国可以而且应该通过这样的一个定义。他说，对于确定侵略定义一事采取否定的态度一定会造成在国际关系中的专横行为。他敦促委员会进一步研究确定侵略定义的问题，并且批评了那些反对确定侵略定义的国家代表们的反对意见。厄瓜多尔代表接着说，倘使过去曾经及时通过一个侵略定义的话，我们就会避免了某些悲惨的历史事件。通过侵略定义这件事对于小国是极为重要的。他同时提议把上述问题提交委员会作进一步考虑。
    在会议快要结束时，瑞典与法国的代表竭力为他们自己辩解。
    维辛斯基援引瑞典代表在委员会以前一次会议上所说的话指出，瑞典代表不能卸脱诽谤的罪名。维辛斯基在答复法国代表时引用了一些文件，证明法国统治集团在与苏联缔结的互不侵犯条约掩护之下曾在一九三九年和一九四○年协助芬兰法西斯分子对苏联作战，并且证明当时的法国统治集团曾准备派一支远征军到芬兰去以便侵略苏联。
    委员会接着宣告休会。委员会将在下次会议上开始讨论所提出的提案。
