Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," Soviet scientists, writers, film directors and actors, Soviet heroes, and advanced workers familiar to the Chinese people were invited to deliver speeches to Chinese radio listeners. The Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the recordings of these speeches to the national audience from the 7th to the 9th.

    President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, said in his speech: The current "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" once again demonstrates the brotherly affection between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and proves that the creative cultural exchange between our two peoples is strengthening day by day. The scientific work carried out by Chinese scientists plays a huge role in China's economic transformation, in the successful implementation of the national industrialization policy, and in large-scale construction. On behalf of all Soviet scientists, I extend my sincere brotherly respect to the great Chinese people and wish you continuous new achievements in building a strong People's Democratic China.

    Professor Ginisov, Chairman of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, specifically explained how the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific circles enthusiastically introduce Chinese people's literature and art through translation, lectures, exhibitions, film screenings, and concerts. He said: We wholeheartedly congratulate the Chinese people on their continuous new achievements in building their great motherland.

    Soviet writer and Stalin Prize laureate Simonov, after recalling his visit to China three years ago, said: For us Soviet people, nothing is more natural than the feeling of brotherly love for foreign friends who are building a rational new society. Today, with brotherly affection, we sincerely congratulate Chinese comrades on their happiness and prosperity. We wish all workers continuous achievements in joyful labor; we wish all those who fight for truth victory; we wish Chinese children a happy childhood and Chinese youth a happy learning experience; we wish Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, longevity!

    Soviet writer Kozhevnikov, who recently participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, said: I recall with excitement the days spent in Beijing. We saw the city growing and being built, with tall residential buildings, schools, and hospitals constantly being erected. The face of China's ancient capital embodies the great power of the entire Chinese people who are building their bright future.

    Liu Kosmodemyanskaya, the mother of two Soviet heroes, Zoya and Shura, said to the Chinese radio listeners: I often receive letters from China. The letters are written to me by people from all walks of life, including Young Pioneers and primary and secondary school students, university students, and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I always read these letters very carefully. They express their love and friendship for the Soviet Union in sincere and warm words from the bottom of their hearts, and they show their desire for peaceful creative labor, for peace, and for friendship between all nations. May our friendship become more and more consolidated day by day.

    Alexei Meresyev, the protagonist of "A Real Man" and a Soviet hero, beloved by the vast majority of our people, said in his speech: Now every honest person in the world knows that the stronger the Sino-Soviet friendship, the stronger the great camp of democracy and socialism, then the more firmly the cause of peace will be, and the less opportunity the American and British war instigators will have to realize their sinister schemes. We watch with admiration the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending the freedom and independence of the fraternal Korean people.

    Maria Rozhneva, a female worker at the Moscow Kubavina Fine Wool Fabric Factory, a Stakhanovite worker, and a Stalin Prize laureate, visited our country in 1950 as part of the Soviet youth delegation. She said: After returning from China, I reported to the female workers in our factory about our visit with our sincere good friends. Dear Chinese friends, we are very concerned about the achievements you have made in developing the national economy of the People's Republic of China and improving the people's cultural level. These achievements make us very happy because it consolidates the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Fedor Dubkovetsky, a representative of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, a Hero of Socialist Labor, and the chairman of the "October Victory" collective farm in Kiev Oblast, Ukraine, said: This spring, a Chinese farmers' delegation and envoys of New China came to our place. They saw the wealth of the farm and witnessed firsthand how rich and civilized our lives are. Our total income this year reached two million rubles, and the farmers of the collective farm received a lot of money, food, and other products. We are proud of our achievements and also happy for the achievements of the great Chinese people.

    Sergei Gerasimov, a famous Soviet film director, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, and Stalin Prize laureate, who participated in directing films such as "Liberated China," said in his speech: In order to consolidate the friendship formed between Chinese and Soviet artists in those days, I also directed the opera "The White-Haired Girl," which was performed at the Vakhtangov Theater in Moscow. This work inspired all the staff of the theater to carry out tenacious and creative rehearsal attempts. Everyone involved in the play realized their responsibility to introduce this outstanding work of Chinese drama to Soviet audiences.

    Natasha Zashchipina, a Soviet seventh-grade student who starred in films such as "First Grader" and "They Have a Motherland," said to the Chinese children: I often hear and read about the democratic New China on the radio, in newspapers, and magazines. In our country, there are no children who do not go to school. Our schools are spacious and bright. I am in the seventh grade and I study very well. Two years ago, Shvernik, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, awarded me the "Labor Medal" in the Kremlin, at that time I was only eleven years old. We are very happy because the great Chinese people have chosen the happy path that the Soviet people have taken.
