    Protesting the Bloody Crimes of the U.S. Side at the Koje Island POW Camp
    The murderous American aggressors, on the 14th of this month, once again created an unprecedented bloodbath in the Koje Island POW camp, killing 82 of our captured personnel and wounding 120. This is the highest peak in the number of prisoner-of-war killings that the U.S. side has been forced to admit in the past. We express our extreme indignation and once again lodge a serious protest with the U.S. side.
    Before the start of the armistice negotiations, the United States had already been carrying out a series of criminal activities in the U.S. POW camps. After the start of the armistice negotiations, large numbers of American and Syngman Rhee bandit secret agents, under the supervision of the U.S. Eighth Army, intensified their criminal activities in the POW camps. Since September of last year, the U.S. side has continuously transferred large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents from Taiwan to serve as "instructors." These secret agents used inhuman methods to conduct "screening," "re-screening," and "consultations" of the captured Korean and Chinese personnel, coercing them to "reject repatriation." When our captured personnel resolutely resisted, they were subjected to beatings and various extremely barbaric tortures and poisonings. This group of secret agents took advantage of the prisoners of war losing consciousness to use the blood from their wounds to take fingerprints and tattoo their bodies. Over the past year, based solely on reports published by the U.S. government and the International Committee of the Red Cross, more than 3,000 prisoners of war have been beaten to death or injured by the U.S. side. In addition, according to the Korean Central News Agency, in May of last year, 1,400 prisoners of war were secretly transported to the United States to be used as test subjects for atomic weapons. In May of this year, in POW Camp No. 77, prisoners of war who demanded to be repatriated were used as test subjects for a new type of flamethrower, and 800 prisoners of war were burned alive.
    While the American aggressors were creating this series of appalling and bloody crimes, they were also chanting about "humanity" and "freedom," saying that "prisoners of war do not want to go home" and that "forced repatriation should not be used." These absurd and preposterous claims are in complete violation of the principles of the Geneva Convention. Article 118 of the 1949 Geneva Convention clearly stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of actual hostilities." The U.S.'s blatant and unreasonable trampling of international conventions must be severely punished.
    This time, the U.S. side created this bloody massacre at the Koje Island POW camp. The increasingly frequent and increasingly brutal crimes of the American aggressors in massacring prisoners of war are clearly "a challenge to the basic human nature shared by all mankind." However, the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by the United States, passed an illegal resolution on the Korean issue based on the Indian proposal on the 3rd of this month, supporting the U.S.'s absurd claim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. This is intolerable. In the United Nations General Assembly, the American aggressors, in order to force the General Assembly to pass a resolution on the Korean issue aimed at forcibly detaining prisoners of war, repeatedly talked about "humanitarian principles" and "the free will of prisoners of war." They thought that playing this deceptive trick could cover up their heinous crimes. However, the Koje Island massacre shattered the lies of the American aggressors' so-called "humanitarian principles" and "free will of prisoners of war" and the signboard of so-called "non-forced repatriation." Therefore, all people who uphold peace and justice must stand up and oppose the U.S. conspiracy to detain prisoners of war and the crime of massacring prisoners of war.
    Our captured personnel in the U.S. POW camps have been waging and are continuing to wage a great and just struggle to win the sacred right to return home to live a peaceful life. We firmly believe that this sacred right can never be deprived by the enemy with bayonets. The Chinese and Korean people, and all peace-loving people in Asia and the world, will persist in the struggle to the end to realize this sacred right of prisoners of war.

### 抗议美方在蜂岩岛战俘营的血腥罪行

    抗议美方在蜂岩岛战俘营的血腥罪行
    杀人成性的美国侵略者，于本月十四日又在蜂岩岛战俘营制造了打死我方被俘人员八十二人，打伤一百二十人的空前大血案。这达到了美方历次被迫承认的屠杀战俘数字的最高峰。我们以无限的激愤，向美方再一次提出严重的抗议。
    美国在停战谈判开始前，就已经在美方战俘营中进行了一系列的罪恶活动。在停战谈判开始后，大批美国和李承晚匪帮的特务在美国第八军的监督下，在战俘营中的罪恶活动更加变本加厉。从去年九月起，美方又陆续从台湾调了大批蒋匪特务去当“教官”。这些特务们用了惨无人道的手段，对朝中被俘人员进行“甄别”、“再甄别”和“征询”，胁迫他们“拒绝遣返”。我方被俘人员坚决反抗，就遭到毒打和各种极端野蛮的刑罚和毒杀。这一班特务乘着战俘们失掉知觉的时候就用他们伤口上的血来打指印，在他们身上刺字。一年来，仅根据美国官方发表的和红十字国际委员会的报告，被美方打死打伤的战俘已达三千多人。此外，据朝鲜中央通讯社公布，去年五月，有一千四百名战俘被秘密地运往美国作原子武器的试验品。今年五月，在第七十七号战俘营中又有要求遣返回家的战俘被用来作为一种新型的火焰放射器的试验品，八百名战俘被活活烧死了。
    美国侵略者一面制造这一连串的惨绝人寰的血腥罪行，一面又高唱什么“人道”、“自由”，说什么“战俘不愿回家”、“不得用武力强迫遣返”。这些荒谬绝伦的主张是完全违反日内瓦公约的原则的。一九四九年的日内瓦公约第一百一十八条明文规定：“实际战事终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。”美国横蛮无理地公开蹂躏国际公约的罪行，必须受到严厉的惩罚。
    美方这次在蜂岩岛战俘营又制造了这个血淋淋的大屠杀事件。美国侵略者这种越来越频繁、越来越残暴的屠杀战俘的罪行，分明是“对于人类所共有的基本人道本性的一个挑战”，然而在美国操纵之下的联合国大会，竟在本月三日根据印度提案通过了关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，支持美国强迫扣留战俘的荒谬主张，这是无论如何不能容忍的。在联合国大会上，美国侵略者为了要迫使大会通过以强迫扣留战俘为目的的关于朝鲜问题的决议案，曾口口声声侈谈什么“人道原则”与
    “战俘自由意志”，它以为玩弄这一套骗人的把戏就可以遮盖它的滔天罪行，然而蜂岩岛大屠杀事件，却把美国侵略者的所谓“人道原则”与“战俘自由意志”的谎言和所谓“不强迫遣返”的招牌摔得粉碎了。因此，一切维护和平与正义的人们都必须起来，反对美国扣留战俘的阴谋和屠杀战俘的罪行。
    在美方战俘营中的我方被俘人员为了争取回家过和平生活的神圣权利，已经进行了并且正在继续进行着伟大的正义斗争。我们深信：这种神圣的权利决不是敌人用刺刀所能够剥夺的。中朝人民、全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民都将为实现战俘的这种神圣权利而坚持斗争到底。
