Xinhua News Agency, Korean Kimhwa Front, 5th: In a blocking action on Hill 597.9 in Shangganling, the Fourth Platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, combining courage with superior command tactics, created a glorious battle example of annihilating nearly 400 enemies at the cost of only three lightly wounded on our side. As a result, the platoon has been awarded the Collective Second Class Merit once, and the deputy platoon leader Cai Xinhai, who commanded the battle, has been awarded the First Class Merit once.

    On November 2nd, the Fourth Platoon was blocking the advancing enemy on a position on Hill 597.9. After they repelled two enemy attacks, the platoon leader and two soldiers were wounded. Deputy Platoon Leader Cai Xinhai promptly reorganized the combat formation and then led the soldiers to continue fighting. Before launching their third attack, the enemy first bombarded with artillery and then fired with machine guns, seemingly to cover their infantry's assault. At this time, the soldiers all rushed out of the tunnels and fortifications, preparing to meet the enemy. However, Cai Xinhai looked up and saw that the enemy infantry was still lying prone more than 200 meters away. He immediately judged that the enemy was playing a new trick and ordered the soldiers to quickly return to the tunnels and fortifications for cover. As expected, as soon as the soldiers entered the fortifications, a large number of enemy shells came crashing down. Thus, the enemy's scheme to lure our soldiers out of the fortifications and then inflict casualties with artillery fire failed. To avoid unnecessary casualties and to use their firepower appropriately, the soldiers organized several combat teams. If the enemy came in small numbers, they would send a few people to strike them, while the rest of the soldiers would hold platoon meetings in the fortifications to promptly summarize combat experience and identify the patterns of enemy artillery and infantry coordination in order to guide the next battle. If the enemy came in large numbers, they would all enter the battle, using the most fierce firepower to inflict casualties on the enemy, and use shell craters and terrain to gradually approach the enemy, throwing hand grenades until the enemy was completely defeated and fled down the mountain. On one occasion, the enemy attacked them with two companies, and two platoons of the enemy had already迂回flanked to the right side of the position. In this critical situation, Deputy Platoon Leader Cai Xinhai directed the soldiers to launch a swift counterattack against the enemy. Soldier Zhu Housheng threw more than 50 hand grenades in succession, and other soldiers also bravely charged towards the enemy, repelling the enemy in one fell swoop. On that one day, the Fourth Platoon successively repelled seven enemy attacks, killing and wounding nearly 400 enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 5th: On the Kimhwa front, our powerful logistics troops, under the slogan of "Everything for the front, everything for victory," are intensely engaged in frontline transportation and supply work, playing a significant role in ensuring the victory of the Shangganling battle.

    When the battle began, enemy aircraft frantically bombed our army's transportation areas in the Shangganling area, once dropping more than 1,000 bombs. However, our motor transport troops still bravely drove over the rugged mountain roads, braving the threat of enemy aircraft and artillery bombardment, and sent large quantities of ammunition to the front lines. When enemy aircraft destroyed two bridges in a certain area, the engineers braved the enemy's blockade and, in sub-zero cold weather, jumped into the biting river water and rebuilt four bridges, allowing the torrent of trucks loaded with ammunition to continue flowing to the front lines. In the loading and unloading units, they were also working intensely with fast loading, fast unloading, and fast concealment, increasing the efficiency of loading and unloading by more than double. A loading and unloading company of a certain unit loaded and unloaded the ammunition of 300 vehicles in one night. Near the front lines, where vehicles could not pass directly, transport team members, baggage team members, and stretcher bearers carried supplies day and night. Transporter Feng Yunxiang persisted in transporting ammunition even with sores on his feet. He said, "Be a hero in battle, and strive for meritorious service on the transportation front." Transporter Na Changyou climbed mountains and ridges for three days to transport more than 400 pounds of food and ammunition to the front-line positions, and carried back three wounded soldiers. The large quantities of comfort goods presented to the Kimhwa front by the motherland's delegation were also delivered to the hands of the front-line soldiers in a timely manner, inspiring the fighting will of the commanders and fighters who were fighting.

    The combat troops in the Shangganling area expressed their special thanks in a telegram to the logistics troops for their timely support. The telegram stated: "Thanks to your powerful guarantee in supply, we have no worries in carrying out such a large-scale battle. We deeply feel that every victory in our battles is inseparable from your support. We would like to express our heartfelt greetings and gratitude to all comrades on the logistics front."

    志愿军某部在上甘岭创光辉战例
    在一次战斗中歼敌近四百我仅轻伤三人我强大后勤部队坚持火线运输保证上甘岭战斗的胜利
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线五日电】中国人民志愿军某部第四班在上甘岭五九七点九高地的一次阻击战中，用勇敢精神和优越指挥相结合的战法，创造了仅以轻伤三名的代价获得歼敌近四百名的光辉战例。因此该班已被荣记集体二等功一次，指挥这次战斗的副班长蔡新海被荣记一等功一次。
    十一月二日，第四班在五九七点九高地的一个阵地上阻击进犯的敌人。当他们打退敌人两次攻击以后，班长和两个战士负伤了，副班长蔡新海便及时地整顿了战斗组织，接着就指挥战士们继续战斗。敌人在开始第三次攻击前，先用炮轰，再用机关枪射击。看起来好像是掩护他们的步兵发起冲锋的样子。这时战士们都从坑道工事里跑出来，准备迎击敌人。可是，蔡新海抬头一看，发现敌人的步兵还在二百公尺以外的地方伏着不动。他马上判断出这是敌人在玩新花样，便命令战士们迅速进入坑道工事隐蔽。果然当战士们刚进入工事，敌人的大批炮弹就打来了。这样，敌人想把我军战士骗到工事外面，然后用炮火进行杀伤的诡计就失败了。战士们为了避免不必要的伤亡和适当的使用火力，组织了几个战斗小组。如果敌人来的人不多，他们就派少数人去打击敌人，剩下的人便在工事里开班务会，及时总结战斗经验，找出敌人炮兵和步兵协同作战的规律，以便指导下一次的战斗。如果敌人来得很多，他们就全体进入战斗，用最猛烈的火力去杀伤敌人，并且利用弹坑和地形，一步一步向敌人逼近，向敌人掷手榴弹，一直把敌人打得垮下山去。有一次，敌人用两个连的兵力向他们扑来，并且有两个排的敌人已经迂回到阵地的右侧。在这个危急的情况下，副班长蔡新海指挥战士们以迅猛的动作向敌人发起了反击。战士祝厚胜连续投出五十多个手榴弹，其他战士也都英勇地向敌人冲杀，一口气把敌人全部击退。就在这一天里，第四班先后打退敌人七次攻击，杀伤敌军近四百名。
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】金化前线我强大的后勤部队在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号下，紧张地投入火线运输供应工作，对保证上甘岭地区战斗的胜利起了重大作用。
    当战斗开始后，敌机疯狂地轰炸上甘岭地区我军的运输地区，有一次竟投弹一千多枚。但是我军汽车运输部队仍然英勇地驰过崎岖的山道，冲过敌机敌炮的轰击威胁，把大量弹药送上阵地。当敌机把某地两座桥梁炸坏了，工兵们就冒着敌机的封锁，在摄氏零下的寒冷气候，跳进刺骨的河水里重新架起了四座桥梁，使满载弹药的汽车洪流继续源源开向前线。在装卸部队里，也在快装、快卸和快藏地紧张工作，使装卸工作效率提高了一倍以上。某部装卸连在一夜中就装卸了三百辆汽车的弹药。在接近火线的地方，由于汽车不能直接通过，运输队员、辎重队员和担架队员们就日夜地搬运。运输员冯云香脚上生了疮还坚持运送弹药。他说：“在战斗中当英雄，运输战线上也要争取立功。”运输员那常友在三天中爬山越岭给前沿阵地运送了四百多斤粮弹，并背下来三个伤员。祖国人民慰问团赠给金化前线的大批慰劳品，也及时送到了前线战士们的手中，鼓舞了正在作战的指挥员、战斗员的战斗意志。
    上甘岭地区作战部队，对于后勤部队及时的支援，特致电表示感谢。电文中说：“由于你们在供应上的有力保证，使我们在进行如此规模巨大的战斗中毫无顾虑。我们深深感到：我们每一次战斗的胜利，都是与你们的支援分不开的。我们谨向后勤战线上的全体同志致以衷心的慰问和感谢。”
