    Shenyang No. 321 Factory's Experience in Trial-Manufacturing New Products
    After accepting the task of trial-manufacturing new products in April this year, the Shenyang No. 321 Factory encountered many difficulties. For example, there were no blueprints, the equipment was old and broken, and only a few technical cadres possessed technical theory and practical experience. However, with the efforts of all employees, the trial-manufacturing task of new products was finally completed successfully, and mass production began in late August, which resulted in receiving awards from the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry.
    The factory has gained the following key experiences in the work of trial-manufacturing and manufacturing new products:
    1. Do a Good Job of Preparation Before Trial-Manufacturing
    Before the trial-manufacturing, the factory first carried out ideological mobilization, organized relevant cadres and employees to study documents, and studied the possible difficulties encountered in trial-manufacturing new products, so that cadres and trial-manufacturing personnel clearly realized that completing the trial-manufacturing task and entering mass production as soon as possible is one of the guarantees for completing the national plan and increasing production and practicing economy, and is a serious political task to accelerate the country's industrialization. At the same time, it educated all trial-manufacturing personnel that they must learn from the Soviet Union in technology, consult with the masses when encountering difficulties, and establish a work style of firmly relying on the masses.
    After carrying out ideological mobilization, the Party and the Communist Youth League respectively mobilized Party members and League members to participate in the trial-manufacturing work and play a backbone role in the work; and coordinated with the trade union to mobilize veteran workers, advanced figures, and model workers to participate in the trial-manufacturing work.
    On the basis of unified thinking, the organization began to organize forces, formulate trial-manufacturing plans, implement division of labor, and establish a specialized responsibility system; and organized a new product trial-manufacturing committee headed by the factory director. The committee established sub-groups for parts trial-manufacturing, tool design, inspection, quota, and technical regulations, each responsible for its own responsibilities, and carried out trial-manufacturing using a method of parallel construction and separate connection.
    The factory also merged the design planning section and the technical management section according to the specific circumstances of the new product trial-manufacturing; the drawings initially designed by the technical personnel or designed after consulting with the workers were first studied together with the workshop technicians, technical staff, and veteran workers. There are two benefits to doing this: one is that technical personnel lacking practical experience can absorb the opinions of workers during the design process, which can reduce problems during testing; and the other benefit is that workers can know the key points of the new product before trial-manufacturing, which can prepare them ideologically and facilitate future trial-manufacturing.
    2. Conduct Trial-Manufacturing to Prepare for Mass Production
    In the trial-manufacturing process, the first experience gained by the factory was to put ensuring the quality of trial-manufactured products in the first place. To this end, the administration must design tools that meet specifications, overhaul the precision of machines, and select workers with higher technical levels to participate in the trial-manufacturing work. Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres should mobilize the masses to learn advanced technology, because the first difficulty encountered in the trial-manufacturing of new products is that our technical level is low and we cannot master the technology for manufacturing new products. To solve this problem, the factory's trade union has done a lot of work. For example, the defect rate of the ninth group of the second workshop was as high as 23%, and the trade union organized a "skills courtyard" to invite technicians, inspectors, and veteran workers to analyze the causes of the defects and improve the tools, so that the defect rate was reduced to 13%. For example, organizing exhibitions of excellent products and defective products has also played a certain role in mobilizing the masses to put forward rationalization proposals. Niu Zhanyuan, a worker in the heat treatment group, and Wang Gui, a technician, suggested changing the heat treatment equipment to a rotary type, which, when implemented, made the product quality reach the indicators proposed by Soviet experts.
    The second experience is to accumulate experience and data in a timely manner to prepare for the formulation of technical operating procedures and quotas. First of all, technical operation records should be made in each experimental manufacturing process, gradually studied and improved, so that trial-manufacturing personnel can master advanced technology. The operating procedures for mass production are formulated based on these original data after research, improvement, and concentration of advanced operating methods. Secondly, it is necessary to determine the quality standards of semi-finished products and systematically calibrate various quotas during trial-manufacturing. When the trial-manufacturing has achieved certain results, we must begin to calibrate various quotas. Although the initial quota data is not very useful, it can train quota staff to analyze problems from the data obtained, and it also helps to improve the trial-manufacturing work and lay the foundation for formulating correct quotas.
    The third experience is that leading cadres and technical personnel should go deep into the workshops to help solve problems in a timely manner; the trade union should formulate contact contracts with workshops, sections, and shares participating in the trial-manufacturing work according to the trial-manufacturing plan and progress, so as to mutually guarantee and supervise the completion of the trial-manufacturing task on schedule.
    3. Enter Mass Production
    Before mass production begins, several specific preparations must be made.
    First, according to the experience of trial-manufacturing and the requirements of mass production, the administration should modify or overhaul all machines and prepare raw materials and precision tools; the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union should mobilize veteran workers to overhaul the machines in their own teams and set out an implementation plan.
    Second, the rationalization proposal committee of the workshop collects the defective products caused by each workshop and each process, finds out the key to the defective products, analyzes the causes, and makes defective product specimens; organizes exhibitions of excellent products and defective products, and mobilizes all workers to find ways to solve the key problems that may cause defective products in mass production.
    Third, technical personnel, trade union team leaders, administrative team leaders, veteran workers, and workers participating in the trial-manufacturing form a core group, and according to the experience of trial-manufacturing, make preliminary technical operating procedures, and try to make the workers participating in the manufacturing memorize them, so as to ensure the smooth progress of mass production.
    4. Do a Good Job of Ideological Investigation and Ideological Mobilization
    In the production of new products, the vast majority of workers are afraid of lowering their wages due to low production efficiency, and are afraid of being transferred to work if they do not complete their tasks. Workers with simple processes have complacency and think there is nothing to it; veteran workers have antagonistic emotions towards new workers. According to these situations, from top to bottom, through large and small meetings and foreman and team leader training classes and other methods, the workers are repeatedly educated to clarify the political and economic significance of producing new products, and criticize incorrect thinking; at the same time, the workers are educated on wage policies to break various ideological concerns.
    After starting to manufacture new products, the factory focuses on doing two things. The first is to strengthen production management and technical management. To whichever workshop the new product flows, administrative management personnel, technical personnel, and Party and trade union cadres will follow to that workshop to discover and solve problems in a timely manner; at the same time, they must do technical calibration and other work, and summarize advanced experience in a timely manner and promote it. The second is to grasp the ideological situation of workers in a timely manner, establish advanced thinking, and organize competitions. After the production of new products began, many young workers were panicked because of their low technical level; workers in the tool workshop saw that the tools were used too much and were afraid that they would not be supplied in time, and their confidence was not high; and individual backward workers believed that they could get average piece-rate wages no matter how much or how little they did. However, there were also advanced workers, such as Xue Lianke of the first process of the second workshop, whose output was the highest record in the entire workshop from the beginning, exceeding the output of old products by 10%, and the quality was 100% qualified. Party and trade union cadres talked to him, publicized his advanced thinking, and each workshop also held employee meetings to publicize advanced thinking and reward workers with significant achievements. In this way, work can be continuously improved and developed, and the competition movement can be carried out in depth.

    沈阳三二一工厂试制新产品的经验
    沈阳三二一工厂今年四月份接受试制新产品的任务后，曾碰到许多困难。如没有图纸、设备破旧、只有极少数具有技术理论与实际经验的技术干部。但是，在全体职工的努力下，终于胜利地完成了新产品的试制任务，并于八月下旬开始大批生产，因而受到中央重工业部的奖励。
    该厂在试制与制造新产品工作中，取得几点主要经验：
    一、做好试制前的准备工作
    在试制之前，该厂首先进行了思想动员，组织有关干部和职工学习文件，研究试制新产品可能遇到的困难，使干部和试制人员明确认识到完成试制任务、早日进入大量生产，是完成国家计划与增产节约计划的保证之一，是加速国家工业化的严重政治任务。同时，教育全体试制人员在技术上必须向苏联学习，遇到困难必须和群众商量，树立坚决依靠群众的思想作风。
    进行思想动员之后，党和青年团即分别动员党员、团员参加试制工作，在工作中起骨干作用；并协同工会动员老工人、先进人物、劳动模范参加试制工作。
    在思想统一的基础上，开始组织力量，订出试制计划，实行分工，建立专责制；并组织以厂长为首的新产品试制委员会。委员会下设部件试制、工具设计、检验、定额、技术规程等小组，各负专责，以平行施工分别衔接的方法进行试制。
    该厂又根据新产品试制的具体情况，把设计计划股和技术管理股合并；把技术人员初步设计的或根据与工人研究后设计出来的图纸，先和车间技师、技术员、老工人一起研究。这样做有两个好处：一个是缺乏实际经验的技术人员在设计时汲取工人的意见，在试验时，就可以少出问题；再一个好处是可以使工人在试制前，知道新产品的关键所在，在思想上有所准备，便于将来进行试制。
    二、进行试制，给大批生产
    准备条件
    在试制过程中，该厂取得的第一条经验是要把保证试制品的质量提到首要地位。为此，行政上必须设计合乎规格的工具，检修机器的精密度，选择技术水平较高的工人参加试制工作。党、工会、青年团干部则应发动群众学习先进技术，因为在新产品试制中，首先遇到的困难就是我们技术水平低，掌握不了制造新产品的技术。为解决这一问题，该厂工会做了不少工作。如二车间九小组废品率高达百分之二十三，工会就组织“窍门大院”，邀请技术人员、检查员、老工人，一起分析出废品的原因，改进了工具，使废品率降低到百分之十三。又如组织优良产品和废品的展览会，对发动群众提合理化建议也起了一定作用。热处理小组工人牛占元和技术员汪贵，建议将热处理设备改为旋转式的，执行后使产品质量达到苏联专家所提出的指标。
    第二条经验是要及时地积累经验和资料，为制订技术操作规程和定额做好准备。首先，在每次试验制造过程中，都要做技术操作的纪录，逐步研究与改进，使试制人员能够掌握先进的技术。在大批生产时的操作规程，就是根据这些原始资料加以研究、改进，集中了先进的操作方法而制订的。其次，在试制中要确定半成品质量标准和有计划地标定各项定额。当试制有一定成就时，就要开始标定各项定额。最初的定额资料虽然作用不大，但可以锻炼定额工作人员从已得到的资料中分析问题，同时也有助于试制工作的改进，给制定正确的定额打下基础。
    第三条经验是领导干部和技术人员要深入车间，及时帮助解决问题；工会则根据试制的计划和进度，发动参加试制工作的车间、科股订立联系合同，以便互相保证与督促试制任务的按期完成。
    三、进入大批生产
    在大批生产开始之前，还必须做好几件具体准备工作。
    第一、根据试制的经验和大批生产的要求，行政方面应将全部机器改制或检修好，准备好原材料和精密工具；党和青年团、工会要发动老工人检修好自己班组内的机器，并订出执行计划。
    第二、车间的合理化建议委员会收集各车间各工序造成的废品，并找出产生废品的关键所在，分析原因，做出废品标本；组织优良产品和废品展览会，发动全体工人设法解决在大批生产当中可能产生废品的关键问题。
    第三、技术人员、工会小组长、行政小组长、老工人和参加试制的工人，组成核心小组，根据试制的经验，制成初步的技术操作规程，设法使参加制造的工人记熟，以便保证顺利地进行大批生产。
    四、要做好思想调查和思想
    动员工作
    在新产品生产中，绝大多数工人都怕因为生产效率不高而降低工资，怕因完不成任务调动工作。工序简单的工人则产生自满情绪，认为没有什么；老工人对新工人有对抗的情绪。根据这些情况，从上到下，通过大小会议和工长、组长训练班等方法，反复对工人进行教育，讲清生产新产品的政治、经济意义，批判不正确的思想；同时又向工人进行了工资政策教育，打破各种思想顾虑。
    开始制造新产品以后，该厂着重做两件工作。第一件是加强生产管理与技术管理。新产品流动到哪个车间，行政管理人员、技术人员、党和工会干部就跟到哪个车间，及时发现问题，解决问题；同时要做好技术标定等工作，并及时总结先进经验，加以推广。第二件是及时掌握工人思想情况，树立先进思想，组织竞赛。新产品开始生产后，有不少青年工人因技术水平低而发慌；工具车间工人看见工具用得费，怕供应不上，信心也不高；还有个别落后工人认为干多干少都能拿到计件平均工资。但也有先进工人，如二车间一工序薛连科，他的产量一开始就是全车间最高的纪录，超过旧产品产量百分之十，质量是百分之百合格。党和工会干部就找他谈话，宣传他的先进思想，各车间也召开职工大会，宣传先进思想，奖励有显著成绩的工人。这样，就能使工作不断地提高和发展，并能深入地开展竞赛运动。
