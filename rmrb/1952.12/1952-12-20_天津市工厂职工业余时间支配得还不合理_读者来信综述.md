According to reader letters, most factories in Tianjin also have overlapping organizational structures, excessive concurrent positions for cadres, and unsystematic meetings, resulting in excessively long extracurricular activities for workers and inability to guarantee study time. Currently, the situation is as follows: The average general worker in most Tianjin factories spends no less than fifty or sixty hours per month in meetings. Workers at the Tianjin Automobile Repair Factory often work, study, and attend meetings for twelve hours a day. It is common for activists to enter the factory at 6:00 AM and not leave until 10:00 PM. Du Shaoxiang, the Party Branch Secretary of the cloth field at the State-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill, spent a total of 37 hours and 4 minutes in meetings and studying during the seven days from September 19th to 25th (one of which was a Sunday). On two of those days, he spent 7 hours and 45 minutes each day in meetings. The Party Branch Secretary of the old cloth factory at the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill received three notices to attend meetings at the same time. With so many meetings, often disorganized, workers and cadres cannot get the rest they need, their bodies are exhausted, their health is impaired, and their work cannot be thorough and in-depth. The workers' urgent desire to solve this problem is understandable.

The direct cause of this phenomenon is that factories have many overlapping organizational structures. In general, in addition to the grassroots organizations of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, there are also factory management committees (labor-management consultation committees in private factories), production increase and economy committees, rationalization proposal committees, and twenty to thirty other organizational structures. The Standing Committee of the factory labor union alone generally has seven to thirteen committees, such as organization, culture and education, and labor protection. With so many organizational structures, and a failure to cultivate and promote cadres, the responsible cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League and activists have to take on everything, resulting in a serious problem of cadres holding too many concurrent positions. Generally, cadres hold two or three concurrent positions, and some hold more than ten. Liu Changfu, a model worker at the Tianjin Steel Plant, holds twelve positions; Liang Wanxiang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the United Machinery Plant, holds eleven positions.

Many organizational structures and many meetings inevitably hinder workers' normal study. Tianjin is currently conducting a large-scale literacy campaign in factories with more than 300 people. 330,000 workers and other working people are participating in the accelerated literacy program. According to the instructions of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the study time for accelerated literacy is eight hours per week during the intensive phase and six hours during the consolidation phase. However, in reality, apart from a few factories in the cotton spinning system and other units with normal production and sound leadership and work systems that can study according to the above-mentioned stipulated time, other units, such as those in the heavy industry system (although these factories also have normal production and sound leadership and work systems, the labor intensity of production is particularly high, and workers need more adequate rest) and the local industry system, cannot guarantee study time. The average attendance rate of students in the city in October was 85%, which decreased to 82% in November. In individual factories, such as the Electric Appliance West Factory, the attendance rate dropped to 38%. The Electric Appliance North Factory held five general meetings during one week's six study sessions. The No. 1 branch factory of the United Steel Plant stopped classes for two weeks due to the work of checking and finalizing, so that some students still cannot spell pinyin. After the suspension of classes at the private Dasheng Yarn Factory, 70% of the workers "fell behind." Some workers reflected: "Once classes are suspended, our minds are scattered." Some workers reflected: "If we cannot guarantee our study time, we will write a letter to report to Chairman Mao." The problem is so serious that if it is not vigorously solved, it will inevitably lead to a serious separation of leadership from the masses.

In the past, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was not keenly aware of the seriousness of this problem, and therefore did not use much effort to solve it. It was not until October of this year that this problem attracted their attention. At the first Tianjin Municipal Industrial Conference, a preliminary solution was proposed, stipulating that workers' extracurricular activities should not exceed 12 hours per week (8 hours for study, 2 hours for labor union activities, and 2 hours for Party and Communist Youth League activities); except for decisions made by the central ministries, the Municipal Party Committee, and the Municipal People's Government, all activities that affect production and mobilize workers (including finding model workers and factory directors during production, and sending work teams to work in factories, etc.) must be approved by the Municipal Industrial Management Committee or the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee; except for the central departments, all levels of leading organs and organizations in Tianjin submit various forms and reports to the factories through the Municipal Industrial Management Committee or the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee to reduce the burden on the factories. The above-mentioned regulations of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have naturally played a certain role in reducing workers' extracurricular activity time; but the decision itself is not comprehensive and specific enough. Rationally resolving workers' extracurricular activity time is a very complex and meticulous task. The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee is now further studying the simplification of organizational structures, the reduction of concurrent positions for cadres, and the unified regulation and control of meeting times, in order to fundamentally solve this problem.

    天津市工厂职工业余时间支配得还不合理
    ——读者来信综述
    根据读者来信反映，天津市大部分工厂也存在着组织机构重叠、干部兼职过多、会议漫无制度，以致职工业余活动时间过长、学习时间不能保证等问题。目前，情形是这样的：天津市大部分工厂的一般职工，每月平均会议时间不下五、六十小时。天津汽车修配厂的工人，经常是一天的工作、学习和开会时间达十二小时。积极分子早晨六点钟进厂，晚上十时才离厂是经常的事。国营天津第三棉纺织厂布场党支部书记杜绍祥，自九月十九日到二十五日七天中（其中有一天是星期日），开会、学习共占去三十七小时零四十分钟。七天中有两天每天开会七小时零四十五分钟。国营天津第二棉纺织厂老布厂党支部书记同一个时间有三处通知他去开会。会议这样多而混乱，职工和干部得不到应有的休息，身体疲劳不堪，健康受到损害，工作也不能细致深入。职工们迫切要求解决这一问题的心情是可以理解的。
    造成这种现象的直接原因是，各厂组织机构多而重叠。一般除党、政、工、团的基层组织外，还有工厂管理委员会（私营工厂是劳资协商委员会）、增产节约委员会、合理化建议委员会等二十至三十几个组织机构。仅在厂工会常务委员会下面，一般就设有组织、文教、劳保等七至十三个委员会。组织机构这样多，又不善于培养和提拔干部，事事都要党、政、工、团的负责干部和积极分子来担任，因此干部兼职过多的问题便十分严重。各厂一般干部少的兼二、三职，多的兼十余职。天津钢厂劳动模范刘长福身兼十二职；联合机器厂党总支书记梁万祥身兼十一职。
    组织机构多，会议多，必然就妨害职工的正常学习。天津市现在正在三百人以上的工厂开展大规模的扫除文盲运动。参加速成职字学习的工人及其他劳动人民达三十三万人。根据中共天津市委员会的指示，速成识字在突击阶段每周学习时间是八小时，在巩固阶段是六小时。但实际上除了生产正常、领导和工作制度较健全的单位如棉纺系统等的几个工厂能够按照上述规定时间学习外，其他如重工业系统（这些工厂虽然生产也正常，领导和工作制度也健全，但生产的劳动强度特强，工人需要更充分的休息）和地方工业系统等单位，学习时间均不能保证。全市十月份学员平均到课率是百分之八十五，十一月份减为百分之八十二，个别厂如电工西厂到课率降低为百分之三十八。电工北厂在一个星期的六次学习时间开了五次大会。联合制钢厂一分厂因为搞查定工作，停止上课两个星期，以致有的学员到现在还不会拼音。私营达生纱厂经过停课后，“掉队”的工人达百分之七十。有的工人反映：“一停课心就散了。”有的工人反映：“再不能保证我们的学习时间，我们要写信报告毛主席。”问题这样严重，如果不大力加以解决，势必造成领导上的严重脱离群众。
    中共天津市委员会过去对这个问题的严重程度感觉是不锐敏的，因而也没有用较大的力量来解决这个问题。直到今年十月，这个问题才引起他们的重视。在天津市第一次工业会议上提出了初步的解决办法，规定职工业余活动时间每周不得超过十二小时（学习八小时，工会活动两小时，党、团活动两小时）；除中央各部、市委和市人民政府的决定外，凡是影响生产和动员工人的活动（包括在生产时找劳动模范和厂长，派工作组驻厂工作等），必须经过市工业管理委员会或市委工业部的同意；除中央各部门外，天津市各级领导机关、团体，向各厂要各种表报，统一经过市工业管理委员会或市委工业部，以减少工厂负担。中共天津市委员会上述的规定对于减少职工的业余活动时间自然是起了一定的作用；但决定本身还不够全面和具体。合理解决职工业余活动时间，是一个非常复杂的细致的工作，现在天津市委正在进一步研究精简组织机构、减少干部兼职、统一规定和控制会议时间等问题，以便根本地解决这一问题。
