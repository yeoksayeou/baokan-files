    Zhoujiazhuang Farmers Organize a Technical Research Association
    To the Editor: The farmers of Zhoujiazhuang Village, Jin County, Hebei, have organized an agricultural technology research association. This research association has played a very good role in every farming season, and the farmers trust it very much. The technical research association helped all the farmers in the village to improve their agricultural technology, resulting in increased production of various crops. Liu Luohe harvested 999 jin of corn per mu; Lei Zengcheng's three mu of millet yielded an average of 953 jin of millet per mu; Cao Tongyi, the director of the technical research association, harvested an average of 598.5 jin of seed cotton per mu from his three mu of high-yielding cotton fields. The entire village's 1,025 mu of cotton fields produced an average of 246 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than double the output of last year. Seeing such a bumper harvest, the farmers in the village are even more enthusiastic about learning technology. In order to achieve an even greater bumper harvest next year, Cao Tongyi, the director of the technical research association, went to the county farm to learn soil improvement techniques and to the cotton ginning mill to learn seed selection techniques for cotton. After returning, he first conducted research and experiments with the members of the technical research association. Implementing these two methods can not only increase production but also solve the problem of surplus labor for farmers in winter, preparing for a bumper harvest next year. After they passed these two techniques on to the farmers, they were widely adopted. By December 10th, the whole village had improved 456 mu of soil and selected more than 50 jin of Si Zi No. 4 cotton seeds. The farmers have generally set production increase plans, determined to continuously learn scientific and technological knowledge, strive for a bumper harvest next year, and welcome large-scale economic construction.

    周家庄农民组织技术研究会
    编辑同志：河北晋县周家庄村农民组织了一个农业技术研究会。这个研究会在每个农事季节里都起了很好的作用，农民们都很信任它。技术研究会帮助全村农民，提高了农业技术，使各种庄稼都增产了。刘洛贺一亩玉米收了九百九十九斤；雷增成的三亩谷子，平均每亩产谷九百五十三斤；技术研究会主任曹同义的三亩丰产棉花，平均每亩产籽棉五百九十八斤半。全村一千零二十五亩棉田，每亩平均产二百四十六斤籽棉，比去年的产量提高了一倍多。看到这样的丰收，全村农民都更热心学习技术了。为了明年得到更大的丰收，技术研究会主任曹同义特别到县农场去学习了改良土壤的技术，还到轧花厂学习了粒选棉种的技术。他回来以后，先和技术研究会的人员进行了研究试验。实行这两个办法不只可以提高生产，并且可以解决农民冬天劳力剩余的问题，为明年的丰产做好准备。他们把这两种技术传授给农民以后，农民们都普遍采用起来。到十二月十日，全村已经改良土壤四百五十六亩，选出斯字四比棉种五十多斤。农民们普遍订了增产计划，决心不断学习科学技术，争取明年丰收，迎接大规模的经济建设。李喜生  张钧
