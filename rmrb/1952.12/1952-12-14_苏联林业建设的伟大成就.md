Editor's Note: Comrade Li Wanxin, the author of this article, is the Deputy Director of the Forest Industry Department of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government. From April to August of this year, she visited the Soviet Union with the Chinese Farmers' Delegation. This is an impression of her visit to the Soviet Union.

Stalin's Great Plan for Transforming Nature

In the Soviet Union's socialist-communist construction, Stalin's plan for transforming nature is extremely ambitious. Planting shelterbelts is one of the most important parts of the plan to transform nature. This plan stipulates that in the seventeen years from 1948 to 1965, eight large national shelterbelts will be planted in the European part of the Soviet Union; these eight forest belts are 5,320 kilometers long in total, the longest of which is 900 kilometers. Secondly, shelterbelts will be planted in collective farms and state farms in this area, and sand-fixing forests and water conservation forests will be created in sandy and valley areas. The total afforestation area is 6,148,900 hectares. How big are these forest belts and protected fields? We calculated that if the total area of the forest belts in this area is stretched into a 30-meter-wide forest belt, it can circle the earth 51 times; the area protected by the forest belts is equal to the total territory of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark.

The European part of the Soviet Union is a famous black soil area, with the Volga, Don, and Donets rivers flowing through it. It has 80,000 collective farms and state farms, and more than 120 million hectares of arable land, planted with various crops and industrial crops, accounting for a large proportion of the Soviet national economy.

However, due to excessive logging by capitalists in the Tsarist era, this large area of black soil lacks trees, so it is often attacked by dry winds from the Caspian Sea coast and Central Asia. This kind of dry wind causes two kinds of disasters:

(1) Drought: Due to the attack of dry winds, the Volga River basin has suffered 20 droughts in the past 65 years, and some states have suffered 15 droughts (an average of one drought every three to four years). In drought years, the harvests of collective farms and state farms are greatly reduced, which has a great impact on the country's economic plan (normally, each hectare can harvest 18 to 20 quintals, but during a drought, it can only harvest 6 to 8 quintals).

(2) Soil is eroded and fertility is reduced: Because there are few trees, the fertile soil layer is easily blown away by the east and southeast winds; we personally saw the unevenness of the wheat fields in the miner's state farm in Novosholov District, Stalin Oblast. Agronomist Itchenko told us that this fertile soil was blown in by the wind. This is a serious disaster for areas that have lost their fertile soil layer.

If these two disasters are not prevented, agricultural harvests cannot be guaranteed, and at the same time, due to the decreasing soil fertility, the arable land area will also be eroded and reduced.

The famous Russian soil scientist Dokuchaev began to study how to improve the soil in this steppe area and forest-steppe area to facilitate agricultural development during the Tsarist era. Later, Kostychev and Williams continued and developed his research. These outstanding scientific achievements have now been fully utilized by the Soviet people.

The Role of Forests in Transforming Nature

Dokuchaev began the experimental work of planting forest shelterbelts to improve the soil in 1892. He made three experimental areas. We went to one of his experimental areas—the Great Anna Island Erskoye forest area, 50 kilometers west of Stalin City, Olginsky District—to visit. We saw wheat fields, corn fields, and sunflower fields of different sizes from ten to thirty hectares. Each crop field was surrounded by neat and dense forest belts, which was very beautiful. According to the introduction of Comrade Rabunsky, the head of the Forest Soil Improvement Station and a master of agricultural science, this experimental area covers a total of 700 hectares. For the purpose of the experiment, the protected farmland is divided into blocks of different sizes from 10 hectares to 30 hectares. The width of the forest belts around the farmland varies, some are composed of three rows of trees, and some are composed of five or seven rows of trees (to test how wide is appropriate). The area of the forest belts is 105 hectares, and the area protected by it is 595 hectares. This experiment started in the autumn of 1892, and what we saw was the second generation of forest belts planted by Dokuchaev (logged once in 1928). Before Dokuchaev planted trees, this land was completely grassland wasteland. Because of drought, no crops could be planted and no one lived there. Since planting forest belts, the soil has begun to awaken and become good fertile soil. 1946 was the biggest drought in 50 years. In this experimental area, the winter wheat protected by the forest shelterbelt yielded 24 quintals per hectare, while the land without forest protection only yielded 5 to 6 quintals.

Advanced science and facts have proved that planting forests and forest shelterbelts plays a great role in windbreak, soil structure, soil moisture content, air humidity, and snow accumulation. In the central black soil area, the results of many years of field observation by the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences are:

(1) The wind speed in the shelterbelt can be reduced by 35% to 40%. If the wind speed is 5 meters per second, it can be reduced by 1.7 to 2 meters per second.

(2) Due to the reduced speed of dry winds, the evaporation of soil moisture is also reduced by an average of 30% to 40%.

(3) In areas with forest belts, the relative humidity of the air is 3% to 5% higher than in open grassland areas.

(4) On the land between the forest belts, the distribution of snow is more even than on the land without forest belts. In the fields with forest belts, the height of snow accumulation is more than twice as high as in the fields without forest belts, and the snow melts more slowly, the frozen layer of the land is thin, and the snow water can completely seep into the soil. For example, in the experiment of the Ukrainian Forestry and Agricultural Soil Improvement Scientific Research Institute, the mortality rate of winter wheat frozen to death in the open wilderness in severe winter was 53%, while in the land planted with forests around it, it was less than 15%, so the yield in the land in the forest belt increased by 25% to 30%.

(5) The soil moisture content in the fields protected by the forest belt is 5% to 6% higher than in the fields without the forest belt.

Because the soil moisture in the land between the forest belts is very high, this can improve the effectiveness of fertilization. In the dry conditions of the open fields in southern Ukraine, the yield of corn increased by 1.5 quintals per hectare due to fertilization; in the land between the forest belts, the yield can be increased by 5 quintals under the same fertilization conditions; if fertilizer is applied to winter wheat land in the land between the forest belts, the yield can be increased by 2 quintals per hectare, but in the open field, it is only 0.5 quintals.

(6) Gradually stop the loss of rainwater, the formation of ditches and soil erosion.

(7) Fix shifting sand and transform sandy land into pastures and grasslands.

Incidental benefits: Increase timber, fruits, clean air, beautify nature, and benefit human and animal health.

After the test of the great drought in 1946, advanced state farms and collective farms that planted forest shelterbelts and implemented pasture rotation systems have achieved stable harvests. This huge test fully proves the correctness of this scientific discovery to eliminate natural disasters.

The Completion of Shelterbelts

In the seven collective farms we visited, we saw shelterbelts planted successively every year. Especially in Kharkiv Oblast and Stalin Oblast, it was the harvest season of winter wheat. On both sides of the road where the car passed for dozens of kilometers, we could only see rectangular golden wheat fields of different sizes surrounded by green edges - shelterbelts. It was very beautiful, and the land had been redecorated!

Some of the shelterbelts in the collective farms we visited have completed the seventeen-year plan in 1952, such as the Lenin Collective Farm in Krasnokutsk District, Kharkiv Oblast, which has been fully completed. The total plan for the shelterbelts of the twelve collective farms under the responsibility of the Zhdanov Machine and Tractor Station in Stalin Oblast is 502 hectares. This year, 441 hectares have been completed, and the remaining 61 hectares will be completed in 1953. The 2,000-hectare shelterbelt plan in Marinsky District, Stalin Oblast, will be fully completed in 1953. The whole state of Poltava Oblast plans to plant 41,000 hectares of shelterbelts, and 21,682 hectares have been planted in three years. It is estimated that the remaining more than 10,000 hectares will be fully completed in 1955. Even in Stalin Oblast, which completely lacks forests and is completely exposed steppe area, the shelterbelts planted by 1951 accounted for 28% of the total plan, which was 182% of the three-year plan. The Soviet Union completed 169% of the plan in 1949, the area completed in 1950 was twice as large as in 1949, and 150% of the annual plan was completed in the spring of 1951. Judging from this scale and speed, the entire plan will be completed much earlier.

Machines Can Also Plant Trees

Can planting trees also be mechanized? This question was completely answered after we visited many collective farms and the Qiuguyev Shelterbelt Station. In the shelterbelt station and soil improvement station we saw, more than 90% of the labor related to afforestation work is undertaken by machines. We saw the large-scale use of machines for afforestation for the first time at the Qiuguyev National Shelterbelt Station. There are six tractor teams here, each team has a certain number of tractors, subsoilers, trenchers, cultivators, weeders, tree planters, and seeders. The efficiency of the tree planter is very high, and one tree planter can also plant more than two kinds of trees. There are three types of seeders: small-grain seeders, large-grain seeders, and acorn cluster seeders. The acorn cluster seeder is a new type of machine. It can be used to sow acorns in clusters, with five seeds fixed in each hole. This machine can also be used to sow companion tree species between the two clusters, such as ash, maple, and linden.

According to our understanding, all 570 newly established shelterbelt stations in the Soviet Union are equipped with various standard machines specially used for afforestation. More than 4,000 tractor stations in the steppe and forest-steppe areas have increased the machinery and tools for afforestation. Last year alone, the agricultural and forestry soil improvement stations added 5,143 tractor plows, more than 4,000 cultivators, and 3,690 tree planters and seeders. In addition, there are more than 800 trucks and more than 500 trenchers.

The Scientification of Forestry Construction

The forestry construction in the Soviet Union is closely linked to biological science.

There are many forestry experimental institutions in the Soviet Union. According to our understanding, there are eight forestry scientific research institutes, more than thirty forestry experimental stations, and more than one hundred various experimental bases related to forestry in the Soviet Union. In terms of training forestry cadres, it is said that there are eleven forestry vocational schools with a four-year system in the Soviet Union alone, which can train 5,000 forestry experts every year.

Under the guidance of Michurin's biological science, the achievements of forestry construction in the Soviet Union are enormous. The most impressive thing for our forestry workers is the invention and promotion of Academician Lysenko's oak cluster planting method. This method is to specifically apply Michurin's biological science to the transformation of oak trees. Oak (that is, oak and locust) is a very common tree species in our country, but because its trunk grows crookedly, it is not valued by people. Academician Lysenko has mastered the characteristics of oak trees that have deep roots and like sunlight, and the interdependence and inter-reliance of the biological world, and created good growing conditions for oak trees. The oak cluster planting method he adopted is to densely plant oak clusters, and then plant fast-growing shrubs on both sides of the oak trees to cover the sunlight around the oak trees, so that the oak trees grow upright, transforming a crooked tree species that cannot be used as timber into a tree species with excellent material and suitable for building windbreak forests.

Heroic Figures in Forestry Construction

Countless heroic figures have also emerged in Soviet forestry construction. Taking the Qiuguyev Shelterbelt Station as an example, in the third year of its establishment (1951), four people won the Stalin Prize, and nine people received the Soviet Forestry Ministry's Socialist Competition Winner Medal.

During the visit to this shelterbelt station, we were honored to meet two Stalin Prize winners—Konchonova and Dutiyevan. Konchonova is a 23-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League. She serves as the leader of the tree planting work group. This group, including her seven people, is responsible for planting 10 hectares of national forest belts and managing 1.5 hectares of Lysenko cluster planting land. They are also responsible for weeding and thinning after tree planting, and protecting the survival of trees. She has excellently completed her work tasks. Many people believe that trees cannot be replanted in summer, but Konchonova led all members of the group to transplant at night, and the transplanted saplings all survived, which broke the conservative idea that many people believe that saplings cannot be transplanted in summer. Their task was completed in winter. However, in order to prevent the strong wind from blowing the snow from the wilderness into the valley, which would affect the snow accumulation in the forest land, they automatically scattered and inserted branches on both sides of the forest belt and in the middle of the forest belt to block the wind and accumulate snow. In order to increase the snow accumulation in the forest belt, they also transported the snow in the valley to the forest belt to create good conditions for the growth of saplings in the coming year. They nurtured the saplings like nurturing their own children, so that the survival rate of the saplings reached 95% (the average survival rate of the station is 85%). In the 1.5-hectare cluster planting area, the survival rate is as high as 97%.

A high degree of love for the motherland and one's career is the reason for her success. Konchonova summarized her work experience and said: I love every tree in our country, and I will live with them for the rest of my life.

    苏联林业建设的伟大成就
    李万新
    编者按：本文作者李万新同志是中央人民政府林业部森林工业司副司长。今年四月到八月，她曾随中国农民代表参观团赴苏参观。这是她写的一篇访苏观感。斯大林的伟大改造自然计划
    在苏联的社会主义—共产主义建设中，斯大林的改造自然的计划是十分巨大的。种植防护林带是改造自然计划中的最重要的部分之一。这个计划规定从一九四八到一九六五年的十七年中，在苏联的欧洲部分种植八条大的国家防护林带；这八条林带共长五千三百二十公里，其中最长的一条为九百公里。其次是在这一地区的集体农庄和国营农场种植护田林网，并在砂地、山谷地带营造固砂林、水源林。造林总面积为六百十四万八千九百公顷。这些林带和被防护的田地究竟有多大呢？我们算了一下：如果把这一地区的林带的总面积拉成一条三十公尺宽的林带，那么它能绕地球五十一周；被林带防护的面积等于英国、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时和丹麦领土的总和。
    苏联欧洲部分是有名的黑土地带，伏尔加河、顿河与顿内茨河流于其间，有八万个集体农庄和国营农场，有一亿二千万公顷以上的耕地，种植着各种农作物与工艺作物，在苏联国民经济中占有很大的比重。
    但是，由于帝俄时代资本家过度采伐林木，这大块黑土地带上缺少树林，所以经常受到来自里海沿岸和中亚细亚的旱风的侵袭。这种旱风造成两种灾害：
    （一）旱灾：由于旱风的侵袭，在最近六十五年中，伏尔加河流域曾遭到二十次旱灾，还有一些州遭到十五次旱灾（平均三、四年一次旱灾）。在旱灾的年份里，集体农庄和国营农场的收获量大大减低，这对于国家的经济计划有很大的影响（平时每公顷能收获十八到二十公担，在旱灾时只能收六到八公担）。
    （二）土壤被侵蚀，肥力减低：因为树木少，土壤的肥土层易被东风与东南风吹走；我们亲眼看到斯大林诺州诺渥啸洛夫区的矿工国营农场的小麦田地高低不平的情况。农学家伊琴克同志告诉我们，这些沃土就是被风吹来的。这对失掉沃土层的地区是一种严重的灾害。
    这两种灾害如不防止，就不能保证农业收成，同时由于土壤肥力日减，耕地面积也会被侵蚀而缩小。
    俄罗斯著名的土壤学家杜库洽也夫，在沙皇时代即开始研究如何改良这草原地区和森林草原地区的土壤，以利于农业的发展。后来考斯帖切夫和威廉姆士继续了并发展了他的研究工作。这些科学上的卓越成就，今天已经完全被苏联人民加以利用。
    森林改造自然的作用
    杜库洽也夫在一八九二年开始了种植森林防护带改良土壤的试验工作。他作了三个试验区。我们到了他的试验区之一——距斯大林诺城西五十公里的奥耳金斯基区的森林区——伟大的安那岛耳斯考也参观。我们见到了十到三十公顷的大小不同的麦田，玉米地和向日葵地。每块作物田地的四周都被整齐而茂密的林带所包围着，十分美丽。经森林土壤改良站站长、农业科学硕士拉崩斯基同志的介绍，得知这一片试验地共七百公顷，为了试验的目的，将保护的农田分为十公顷到三十公顷大小不同的块形，农田四周的林带的宽度不一，有的是三行树组成的，有的是五行或七行树组成的（以试验多宽为合度）。林带面积为一百零五公顷，被它保护的田地共五百九十五公顷。这个试验是从一八九二年秋开始的，我们所见到的已是杜库洽也夫所种植的森林带的第二代了（一九二八年采伐过一次）。在杜库洽也夫未种植树林以前，这片土地完全是草原荒地，因为干旱，不能种植任何作物，也无人居住。自从种植林带以后，土壤才开始苏醒过来，成为良好的沃土。一九四六年是五十年来最大一次旱灾。在这个试验区中，在森林防护带保护下的冬小麦，每公顷收获二十四公担，而在无森林保护的田地则只收五到六公担。
    先进的科学及事实证明：种植森林和森林防护带对防风、土壤结构、土壤含水量、空气湿度、积雪等都起很大作用。在中央黑土地区，苏联农业科学研究院在田间多年观察的结果是：
    （一）防护林带中，风的速度能降低百分之三十五到四十，如风速每秒钟五公尺，则每秒钟可减少一点七至二公尺。
    （二）由于干风速度减轻，土壤水分的蒸发量也平均减低百分之三十到四十。
    （三）在有林带的地区，空气的相对湿度比露天草原地区要多到百分之三到五。
    （四）在林带间的土地上，雪的分配比无林带的土地要格外均匀。在有林带的田野上，雪堆积的高度比无林带的田野要高两倍以上，且雪的融化进行得较慢，土地的冻层薄，雪水可以全部渗入土中。例如乌克兰林业和农业土壤改良科学研究所的试验中，在严冬开阔的旷野里，冬小麦冻死的百分率是百分之五十三，而在四周植林的地内，只不到百分之十五，因此在林带中的土地内，其产量提高百分之二十五到三十。
    （五）在林带保护下的田地土壤中，其含水量较无林带的田地土壤多百分之五到六。
    由于林带间地的土壤湿度很大，这就能提高施肥的效力。在乌克兰南部开阔田野的干燥的条件下，由于施肥而增加玉米的产量，每公顷是一点五公担；在林带间的地内，在同样的施肥条件下，可增加产量五公担；在林带间的地内若施肥于冬小麦地，每公顷可增产二公担，但在开阔地内，则只有零点五公担。
    （六）逐渐停止雨水量的流失、沟坎的形成和土壤的冲刷。
    （七）固定流沙，改造沙质地成为牧场与草场。
    附带收益：增加木材、果品、清洁空气，美化大自然，有益于人畜卫生。
    经过一九四六年大旱灾的考验，凡种植了森林防护带与实行牧草轮作制的先进的国营农场与集体农庄，都得到了稳定的收获，这个巨大的考验，充分证明了这个消灭自然灾害的科学发现的正确性。护田林带完成的情况
    我们所参观的七个集体农庄，都看到了每年陆续种植的护田林，尤其在哈尔科夫州和斯大林诺州的时候，正是冬小麦收获之期，在汽车经过的几十公里大路的两旁，远远的只见大小不等的长方形的金黄色的麦田，周围镶着绿油油的边——护田林，十分美丽，大地已经改了装！
    我们所参观的集体农庄的护田林，有的已经在一九五二年完成了十七年的计划，如哈尔科夫州克拉斯诺库特区的列宁集体农庄已经全部完成了。斯大林诺州日丹诺夫机器拖拉机站所负责的十二个集体农庄的护田林总计划为五百零二公顷，今年已完成四百四十一公顷，其余六十一公顷，在一九五三年即可完成。斯大林诺州马林斯基区二千公顷的护田林计划，一九五三年即可全部完成。坡尔塔瓦州全州种植四万一千公顷的护田林计划，三年内已种植了二万一千六百八十二公顷，其余一万多公顷，预计在一九五五年即可全部完成。即使是完全缺少森林的，完全为暴露的草原地区的斯大林诺州，到一九五一年止，种植的护田林占总计划的百分之二十八，为三年计划的百分之一百八十二。全苏一九四九年统计完成了计划之百分之一百六十九，一九五○年所完成的面积比一九四九年大一倍，一九五一年春季即完成全年计划的百分之一百五十。从这个规模和速度来看，整个计划必将大大提前完成。机器也能种树
    种树还能机械化吗？这个疑问在我们参观了许多集体农庄和秋果也夫防护林站以后，完全找到了答案。我们所看到的防护林站和土壤改良站中，有关造林工作的劳动有百分之九十以上是由机械来承担的。我们在秋果也夫国家防护林站第一次看见使用机械大规模造林的情况。这里有六个拖拉机队，每个队都有一定数量的拖拉机、深耕机、掘土机、中耕机、除草机和植树机、树种播种机。植树机的效率很高，一架植树机还可以种植两种以上的树木。树种播种机有小粒树种播种机、大粒树种播种机和橡实丛播机三种。橡实丛播机是一种新式的机器，用它播种橡实，可以播成丛状，每穴固定播下五粒种子。用这种机械还可以在两丛之间播下伴种的树种，如白蜡、枫树、菩堤等。
    据我们了解，全苏五百七十个新设立的防护林站，都有各种专为造林用的标准机械装备。四千多个草原和森林草原地区的拖拉机站，都增加了造林用的机械和工具，单只农林土壤改良站方面，去年一年就增加了五千一百四十三台拖拉犁、四千多台中耕机、三千六百九十多台植树机和树种播种机。此外还有八百多辆卡车、五百多架掘土机等。林业建设的科学化
    苏联的林业建设是和生物科学紧密联系的。
    苏联的林业试验机构是众多的。据我们了解：全苏联有八个林业科学研究院，三十多所林业实验站和一百多所各种有关林业的实验基点。在培养林业干部方面，听说全苏联只四年制的林业专门学校就有十一个，每年可以培养五千个林业专家。
    苏联的林业建设在米丘林生物科学的指导下，成就是巨大的。对我们林业工作者印象最深的一件事是李森科院士的橡树丛播法的发明和推广。这个方法就是具体地把米丘林生物科学运用到改造橡树上。橡树（就是中国的橡、栎）是我国一种很普遍的树种，但是由于它的树干生长弯曲，不为人们所重视。李森科院士掌握了橡树的根深、喜阳光的特性，和生物界的相互联系、相互依属性，为橡树创造了良好的生长条件。他采用的橡树丛播法，是把橡树丛播密植以后，在橡树的两侧种植生长较快的灌木，用以掩蔽橡树四周的阳光，使橡树向上挺直生长，把一种弯曲不成材的树种改造成为一种材质优美和适于营造防风林的树种了。林业建设中的英雄人物
    苏联林业建设方面也涌现出了无数的英雄人物。只以秋果也夫防护林站说，这个站在成立的第三年（一九五一年），就有四个人获得斯大林奖金，有九个人得到苏维埃林业部社会主义竞赛胜利者纪念章。
    在参观这个防护林站时，我们很荣幸地会见了两位斯大林奖金获得者——康巧诺娃和杜捷万。康巧诺娃是一个二十三岁的女共青团员。她担任植树工作小组的小组长。这个小组连她七个人，担任着十公顷国家林带的种植任务和管理一公顷半李森科丛式播种地。她们还要负责树木种植以后的锄草和间苗工作，并保护树木成活。她出色地完成了她的工作任务。许多人认为夏季不能补植树木，而康巧诺娃带领小组全体人员利用夜晚时间进行移植，移植的树苗都活了，这就打破了许多人认为夏季不能移植树苗的保守思想。她们的任务在冬季就完成了。但是，她们为了避免大风把旷野的雪吹到山谷，影响林地积雪，就自动在林带两旁和林带中间散置并插放树枝，以便阻风积雪。她们为了增多林带的积雪，并且把山谷里的雪运到林带中，为来年树苗生长创造良好条件。她们像养育自己的子女一样培育树苗，使树苗的成活率达到百分之九十五（该站平均成活率是百分之八十五）。在一公顷半丛式播种地段中，成活率高到百分之九十七。
    高度地热爱祖国和自己事业是她成功的原因。康巧诺娃总结她工作的心得说：我爱我们国家的每一棵树木，我一生都要和它们生活在一起。
