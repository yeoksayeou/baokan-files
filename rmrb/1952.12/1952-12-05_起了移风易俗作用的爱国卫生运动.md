The great "Patriotic Health Campaign" began in our country in March of this year. From the Northeast to the distant Hainan Island in the South, and from the coast in the East to the border of Xinjiang in the West, this campaign has been carried out vigorously. Many model units and model figures of patriotic health have emerged. This campaign was aroused by the bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism, combined with the people's urgent health needs, and closely coordinated with production tasks, so the masses were very enthusiastic. The broad masses of the people generally understand the principle of "Pay attention to hygiene, love the country." The unhygienic situation caused by the rule, exploitation and oppression of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism for thousands of years has been significantly changed. A new atmosphere of cleanliness and hygiene is emerging everywhere in vast rural and urban areas, diseases have been significantly reduced throughout the country, and some infectious diseases have almost disappeared.

In nine months, the Patriotic Health Campaign has achieved unprecedented results throughout the country: more than 74.65 million tons of garbage have been removed. Most of this cleared garbage had accumulated over the years. For example, Shenyang cleared the garbage from the period of the feudal warlords, the Japanese and the Kuomintang reactionary rule; the Palace Museum in Beijing cleared the garbage since the Ming Dynasty; Jieyang County in Guangdong Province opened a gate that had not been opened for nearly a hundred years after clearing the garbage blocking the city gate, facilitating traffic. The farmers turned the cleared garbage into fertilizer to increase crop yields. According to statistics from the Northeast region, about 90% of the people in the region carried out indoor cleaning, of which about 50% to 60% of the people in rural areas carried out regular environmental sanitation work. Major cities have implemented a regular cleaning system of "People's Hygiene Day."

In the Patriotic Health Campaign, the total length of stinking ditches dredged reached more than 283,000 kilometers; the total volume of filled sewage pits was more than 40.56 million cubic meters. In the past, these sewage ditches and pits had a long-term impact on people's health, but today we have transformed them into construction that is beneficial to people's health. Fuzhou dredged the yin ditches that had been silted up for nearly two hundred years; Shanhaiguan filled a stinking water pit that was said to have been left over from the construction of the Great Wall by Qin Shihuang; a stinking ditch surrounding half of Qinhuangdao City was filled and turned into a road; the stinking lakes in Longtan and Taoranting in Beijing have been excavated and have become beautiful scenic areas.

In order to prevent the breeding of flies, more than 4.92 million toilets have been improved and newly built across the country; people also used methods such as sprinkling lime, covering soil, and adding lids to toilet pits to kill maggots; many of the manure yards in cities have been moved to the suburbs, and many of the manure piles in rural areas have also been moved outside the villages. The broad masses of people caught flies with the highest enthusiasm, making many fly-free areas or areas with very few flies appear across the country: for example, in District 1 of Kuandian County in Northeast China, more than 200 households had no flies; there were very few flies in Beijing, and it was even difficult to find flies or maggots in the vegetable market. The result of the fly-catching campaign not only reduced diseases, but also cultivated a good hygienic habit among the broad masses of people of hitting flies when they see them. About 138.6 billion flies, 4.9 billion maggots, 29.5 billion mosquitoes, 11.31 million catties of mosquito larvae, 790 million fleas, and 2.64 billion lice were killed across the country. A total of about 127.8 million rats were caught across the country, greatly weakening their ability to spread diseases. If each rat eats 8 kilograms of grain a year, then these rats, if not killed, would eat more than 1 billion kilograms of grain a year, enough for 1 million people to eat for two years. Calculated at 500 kilograms of grain per mu, it would take more than 2 million mu of land to produce so much grain. In order to prevent gastrointestinal infectious diseases, work to improve drinking water was also carried out in the Patriotic Health Campaign. A total of more than 1.3 million wells have been improved and newly built; many places that drink river water have established water intake terminals and set up drug drinking water disinfection stations. The major cities also have strict management of food vendors.

In the movement, due to the improvement of people's political awareness and the increase of health knowledge, some unhygienic habits in the past have been changed, many superstitious customs have been broken, and a role has been played in changing customs and habits. For example, the people of Yangtang Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, abolished chamber pots and used toilets instead. In Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces, the custom of "floating coffins" (that is, people who die are not buried, and coffins are parked outside) has also been mostly changed. In Wuxi alone, the people automatically buried 6,166 "floating coffins". After the Patriotic Health Campaign was carried out in Zhiren Village, inhabited by Tibetans in Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, the sanitation situation of the Tibetans there changed: people and animals were separated, and washing hands, washing faces, washing braids, and cutting nails became common things. Even some elderly people have taken action in the Patriotic Health Campaign: an old lady in her sixties in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, asked for a vaccination because she was afraid of getting sick and infecting her children and grandchildren; an old couple in their seventies in East China asked to be vaccinated on the spot after listening to the vaccination propaganda; an 87-year-old Mrs. Zhong in Nanjing participated in fly-catching every day; an 82-year-old Mrs. Chen in Hengfeng County, Jiangxi Province, thoroughly cleaned her bed that had not been cleaned for 39 years. Now the broad masses of people have "changed" the old and backward view of "if it's not dirty, you won't get sick" in the past.

The reason why the Patriotic Health Campaign can achieve such great results is first and foremost because this matter is in the New China of the people, and only with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and the concern for the people's health can the health work be truly combined with the broad masses and become the people's own Patriotic Health Campaign. Secondly, it is due to the active leadership of health departments in various places, especially the central health leadership department under the care and leadership of Chairman Mao, which has urged and inspected the Patriotic Health Campaign in a more organized, planned and step-by-step manner, and has given scientific and technological guidance, so that the Patriotic Health Campaign can be universally carried out in various places. In different stages of the campaign, the central health leadership department has put forward different requirements and plans: for example, in March, April and May, it put forward specific methods and requirements for carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign to the whole country; in June, it formulated the "Patriotic Health Assault Month" plan in order to eliminate the blank spots of the National Patriotic Health Campaign; In July, August, and September, it pointed out that this was the season for direct combat with infectious diseases, and put forward specific requirements for disease prevention and fly-catching, rat-catching, and improving environmental hygiene. In winter, it issued instructions to catch rats, fill pits, eliminate disease-transmitting insects, and carry out patriotic health education in order to prepare for the Patriotic Health Campaign next year. The central health leadership department has successively organized two major inspections across the country, and organized visiting groups for the Patriotic Health Campaign in various regions to visit and learn from each other, and promptly promoted the discovered model typical examples and the experience of the Patriotic Health Campaign to the whole country. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Second National Health Conference will be held in December to select models of the National Patriotic Health Campaign and hold an exhibition of the Patriotic Health Campaign. Therefore, the health departments in various places, under the instructions of the central health leadership department and with the support of the Party and government leading comrades in various places, mobilized the masses and carried out this work, and also laid a broad mass foundation for the health care cause of the New China in the future. Governments at all levels also attach great importance to the Patriotic Health Campaign. Many leaders personally led this work: for example, the governors of Jiangxi, Gansu and other provinces personally led the Patriotic Health Campaign; the mayors and deputy mayors of Beijing, Nanjing, Qingdao and other cities personally urged and inspected the patriotic health work. The county magistrates of Chang'an and other counties in Shaanxi Province also actively and proactively led the Patriotic Health Campaign in rural areas. The county magistrate of Longmen County, Guangdong Province, carried out a major cleaning with the masses and personally carried the garbage; the head of a health center in Changde County, Hunan Province, personally helped farmers clean their courtyards. Therefore, the masses in various places generally reflected: "The people's government is really doing things for the people, so that the people pay attention to hygiene and get sick less." "Chairman Mao cares about our health. We must actively do a good job in increasing production to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea."

At present, the Patriotic Health Campaign is continuing to develop in the direction of consolidating existing achievements and making it regular. Some effective methods are being promoted among the people. For example, the responsibility system for daily cleaning, the "Hygiene Day" in cities, the Patriotic Health Convention for the food industry, and mass inspections are all being promoted. As for filling pits, dredging ditches, improving drinking water, improving fecal treatment, catching rats, killing flies, killing mosquitoes, and health publicity and education, they are also planned to be carried out every year in the future.

    起了移风易俗作用的爱国卫生运动
    陈致明
    我国在今年三月开始了伟大的“爱国卫生运动”。北自东北南到遥远的海南岛，东自沿海西到新疆国境，都轰轰烈烈地开展了这一运动，出现了不少的爱国卫生模范单位和模范人物。这个运动是由美帝国主义发动细菌战所激起，而又结合了广大人民切身的卫生要求，密切配合了生产任务，因此群众热情很高。广大人民一般都懂得了“讲卫生，爱国家”的道理。几千年来由于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义统治剥削和压迫所造成的不讲卫生的情况已经有了显著改变。广大乡村和城市到处呈现清洁卫生的新气象，疾病在全国范围内显著地减少，有些传染病几乎绝迹。
    九个月的爱国卫生运动，在全国范围内获得了空前的成绩：其中清除的垃圾达七千四百六十五万多吨。这些被清除的垃圾，有一大部分是过去多年积留下来的。如沈阳就清除了封建军阀、日本和国民党反动统治时期的垃圾；北京故宫博物院清除了明朝以来的垃圾；广东省揭阳县将一处堵塞城门的垃圾清除之后，打开了将近一百年来未开过的城门，便利了交通。农民们把清除的垃圾，积成了肥料，来增加农作物的产量。据东北区的统计，全区约百分之九十的人民进行了室内大扫除，其中农村约有百分之五、六十的人民进行了定期的环境卫生工作，较大城市都实行了“人民卫生日”的定期清扫制度。
    在爱国卫生运动中疏浚了的臭水沟渠，全长共达二十八万三千多公里；填平了的污水坑，总计四千零五十六万多立方公尺。过去这些污水沟坑长期影响着人民的健康，今天我们却把它们改造成为有益于人民卫生的建设了。福州疏通淤塞将近二百年的阴沟；山海关填平一个据说是秦始皇修长城时留下来的臭水坑；环绕秦皇岛市半周的一条臭沟填平之后，修成了马路；北京市龙潭、陶然亭两地的臭水湖掏挖之后，已成为美丽的风景区域。
    为了防止苍蝇的孳生，全国改善和新修的厕所有四百九十二万多个；人们并采用撒石灰、盖土、厕坑加盖等办法来灭蛆；城市里的粪场已有不少迁至郊区，农村里的粪堆也有不少移到村外。广大人民群众都以最高的热情捕打苍蝇，使全国出现了很多无蝇区，或苍蝇极少的区域：如东北宽甸县一区有二百多家没有苍蝇；北京市苍蝇极少，甚至在菜市上也难找到苍蝇或蛆。捕蝇运动的结果，不但减少了疾病，而且使广大人民养成了一种见蝇就打的良好卫生习惯。全国约共灭蝇一千三百八十六亿多只，灭蛆四十九亿多只，灭蚊二百九十五亿多只，打捞孑孓一千一百三十一万多斤，灭蚤七亿九千多万只，灭虱二十六亿四千多万只。全国共捕了约一亿二千七百八十万只老鼠，大大减弱了它传播疾病的力量。如果以每只老鼠一年吃八斤粮食计算，那么这些老鼠如不捕杀，一年就可吃掉十亿多斤粮食，够一百万人吃两年。以每亩地产粮五百斤计算，也得二百多万亩土地才能生产出这么多的粮食。为了防止肠胃传染病，在爱国卫生运动中还进行了改善饮水的工作。总计已改善和新建的水井有一百三十多万个；许多饮河水的地方建立了取水码头，设了药物饮水消毒站。各大城市对于饮食摊贩也进行了严格的管理。
    在运动中，由于人民的政治觉悟的提高和卫生知识的增加，改变了过去某些不卫生的习惯，破除了不少迷信的风俗习惯，起了移风易俗的作用。如湖南省衡山县洋塘乡的人民取消马桶，改用厕所。在江西、江苏、浙江等省，“浮厝”（即死了人不埋，停柩于外面）的风俗也已大部改变，只无锡一地人民就自动掩埋了“浮厝”六千一百六十六具。爱国卫生运动在青海省湟源县藏族居住的治仁庄开展之后，那里藏族的卫生状况变了样：人畜分了居，洗手、洗脸、洗发辫、剪指甲已成为通常的事了。甚至有些老年人在爱国卫生运动中也行动起来：江西省南昌市有一位六十二岁的老太太要求打预防针，她说怕得了病传染给儿孙；华东有一对七十多岁的老夫妇听了种痘宣传之后，当场要求种痘；南京市有一位八十七岁的钟老太太，每日参加捕蝇；江西省横峰县一位八十二岁的陈老太太，把三十九年未曾打扫过的床铺彻底进行了洗刷。现在广大人民群众已经“改变”了过去“不干不净，吃了没病”的旧的落后观点。
    爱国卫生运动所以能获得这样大的成绩，首先一个重要原因：就是因为这件事出在人民的新中国，有毛主席和共产党的领导与对于人民健康的关怀，才能把卫生工作真正地与广大群众结合，变成了群众自己的爱国卫生运动。其次，就是由于各地卫生部门的积极领导，特别是中央卫生领导部门在毛主席的关怀和领导下，较有组织有计划有步骤地对爱国卫生运动作了督促检查，并给予了科学技术方面的指导，使爱国卫生运动得以在各地普遍开展起来。在各个不同的运动阶段，中央卫生领导部门都提出了不同的要求和计划：如在三、四、五月份向全国提出了开展爱国卫生运动的具体办法和要求；在六月份制定了“爱国卫生突击月”的计划，以便突击消灭全国爱国卫生运动的空白点；在七、八、九月份指出了这是与传染病作直接斗争的季节，提出了预防疾病和捕蝇、捕鼠、改善环境卫生的具体要求。在冬季发出了捕鼠、填坑、消灭病媒昆虫和进行爱国卫生教育的指示，以便为明年的爱国卫生工作做好准备。中央卫生领导部门曾先后组织了两次全国各地的大检查，并组织各区的爱国卫生运动参观团，进行互相参观，互相学习，将发现的模范典型和爱国卫生运动的经验，及时地推广到全国。根据毛主席的指示，在十二月份召开第二届全国卫生会议，评选全国爱国卫生运动的模范和举办爱国卫生运动展览会。因此各地的卫生部门，在中央卫生领导部门的指示和各地党、政领导同志的支持下，发动了群众，开展了这一工作，也给今后新中国的卫生保健事业打下了广泛的群众基础。各级人民政府对于爱国卫生运动也是非常重视的。很多首长都亲自领导这一工作：如江西、甘肃等省的省主席都亲自领导爱国卫生运动；北京、南京、青岛等市的正副市长亲自督促检查爱国卫生工作。陕西省长安等县的县长也积极主动地领导了农村的爱国卫生运动。广东省龙门县的县长和群众一起进行大扫除，并亲自担送垃圾；湖南省常德县的一位卫生所长亲自帮助农民打扫院落。因此各地群众普遍反映：“人民政府真正给人民办事，使人民讲卫生、少生病。”“毛主席关心我们的健康，我们要积极做好增产工作，来增强抗美援朝的力量。”
    目前爱国卫生运动正向着巩固已有成绩，并使之经常化的方向继续开展。一些行之有效的好办法，正在人民群众中推广。如每日清扫的责任制、城市中的“卫生日”、饮食行业的爱国卫生公约和群众性的检查等都正在推广中。至于填坑、浚沟、改善饮水、改善粪便处理、捕鼠、灭蝇、灭蚊和卫生宣传教育等工作，也准备今后每年都进行。
