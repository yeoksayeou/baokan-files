    Cadres in Certain Counties and Districts of Shandong Province Severely Suppress Mass Criticism
    Party and Government Leading Organs of the Province Should Educate Cadres to Conscientiously Correct This Erroneous Attitude
    Editor: We have received your letter checking on the effectiveness of relevant organs in dealing with mass criticism letters published in the newspaper. After the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published my letter on April 1 exposing the suppression of mass criticism by cadres in certain counties and districts of Shandong Province, relevant leading organs sent people to investigate and deal with the matter. Regarding the illegal detention of Li Bao瑢, a militia instructor who exposed the corruption of village cadres, by Fang Ziheng, the district chief of the Fourth District of Changqing County, the leading organs of the county sent people to investigate. It was proven that the situation exposed by Li Bao瑢 and others was basically correct; the village cadre Li Baolin, who had committed corruption, has been dealt with, and the district chief Fang Ziheng has been criticized and ordered to make a profound self-criticism. Regarding the joint accusation by the masses of Dongshahe Village in the Fifth District of Huantai County against township cadres for corruption and illegal activities, the Huantai County Party Committee and the Huantai County People's Government have also changed their attitude of ignoring the matter and have sent people to investigate and deal with it.
    However, it should be pointed out that at present, many county and district cadres in Shandong Province still have a very incorrect attitude towards criticism and suggestions from below. In handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, they also show an intolerable bureaucratic attitude, and even serious violations of law and discipline occur.
    Some county and district cadres adopt an antagonistic and hostile attitude towards people's letters and criticisms in newspapers. They believe that critics write letters "without review," are "disrespectful of the organization," and "conceited," or use excuses such as "criticism has discrepancies" and "the critic's motives are impure" to suppress and attack the critics. For example, Zhang Guanwu, a teacher at Longwa Village Primary School in the Third District of Pingyin County, wrote a letter on behalf of others to our Rural Masses newspaper, accusing village cadre Zhang Erzhu of illegally causing a pregnant woman to miscarry. After the Rural Masses newspaper published this letter in August, the district's cultural and educational assistant sent militiamen to summon the ghostwriter and accuser to the township people's government for illegal interrogation, and reprimanded the ghostwriter for writing the manuscript without the district's review, saying it was "disrespectful of the organization and disregard for leadership," and forced him to reflect and make a self-criticism. This serious incident of suppressing criticism and infringing on human rights has been investigated and verified by the newspaper, and the higher-level leading organs have dealt with it.
    Some cadres of party and government organs do not adopt a serious and enthusiastic attitude towards handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, but adopt a bureaucratic attitude of ignoring them and shirking responsibility. For example, Du Dianwen, a farmer from Dadu Village in the Third District of Licheng County, inquired twice at the district's tax office about the inconsistency of the brick and tile kiln tax in the county with that of the neighboring Zhangli County, but the office did not respond. He went to the Licheng County Tax Bureau, but the county tax bureau ignored him. He went to the Zibo Prefectural Tax Bureau, but the prefectural tax bureau still ignored him. Finally, he wrote a letter to inquire with the Provincial Tax Bureau, and only then did he receive a reply. The Provincial Tax Bureau also instructed the Zhangli County Tax Bureau to send people to inspect the brick and tile kiln tax issue. As another example, Wang Yiting, a member of the newspaper reading group in Tangzi Village in the Fifteenth District of Yidu County, went to the Propaganda Department of the Yidu County Party Committee three times to contact them in order to improve the newspaper reading work, but he could never get in. Each time he went to the People's Inquiry Office of the County Party Committee, the comrades there would either say that no one was in the office or that they were busy with meetings, and just sent him away. How can such cadres do a good job in the People's Inquiry Office? How can they use their work to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses? This shows that the People's Inquiry Offices set up by some organs are still just a formality because they have not sent cadres with a strong mass perspective to work there. This is an issue that deserves attention.
    Some organs do not handle the people's appeals and accusations responsibly according to their own authority and responsibilities, but instead use the excuse of "complex problems" to shirk responsibility to each other, resulting in official documents "traveling" for a long time or cases being delayed again and again, unable to be resolved. For example, Zhao Jiazhu, a farmer from Sunjiagou Village in the Eleventh District of Tai'an County, accused Zhang Fengshan, the deputy township chief, of violating laws and regulations to the People's Court of the county in July and August. The People's Court pushed this matter to the County Discipline Inspection Committee; the committee then pushed it to the Cultural and Educational Section... The case was delayed for more than a month, and the accuser went to the People's Court seven times to urge them; the People's Court ignored him, and it is unknown where the case was pushed to. In mid-September, he wrote a letter to our Rural Masses newspaper telling us about the incident, and the newspaper immediately forwarded it to the Tai'an Prefecture for handling, and sent a letter again at the end of October urging them to handle it, but no reply has been received to this day. As another example, Wang Changmao of Qijia Village in the Eleventh District of Huang County was retaliated against for accusing the village party branch secretary of occupying his nephew's house. He went to the District Committee to demand a solution, and then went to the County Committee several times to appeal, but it was never resolved. He went to the Laiyang Prefectural Committee seven times to appeal and sent several letters; finally, he personally went to the Provincial People's Procuratorate once to appeal and sent several letters, but the problem has still not been resolved. This problem has been delayed for two years. In September this year, Wang Changmao wrote a letter asking our Rural Masses newspaper to assist in resolving the issue, and we have forwarded it to the People's Daily Letters from Readers Group for handling (Our newspaper has already sent a letter to the Shandong Provincial People's Supervision Committee on September 23 asking them to be responsible for handling this incident, and has sent letters urging them to handle it on October 14 and November 3, but no reply has been received to this day. We hope that the Shandong Provincial People's Supervision Committee will quickly take responsibility for handling it.
    —Editor).
    This erroneous attitude towards criticism and bureaucratic work style has seriously affected the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the people and damaged the ties between the Party and the government and the people. Therefore, I suggest that the party and government leading organs of Shandong Province pay serious attention to this issue and quickly take effective measures to educate cadres to conscientiously correct the above-mentioned erroneous behaviors so that the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Magazines" and the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People's Visits" can be better implemented.

### 山东省某些县区干部严重压制群众批评  该省党政领导机关应教育干部切实纠正这种错误态度

    山东省某些县区干部严重压制群众批评
    该省党政领导机关应教育干部切实纠正这种错误态度
    编辑同志：你们检查有关机关对报纸上发表的群众批评信件所起效果的来信收到了。四月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了我揭发山东省某些县区干部压制群众批评的来信后，各有关领导机关都曾派人进行调查和处理。长清县四区区长房子恒非法扣押揭发村干部贪污事实的民兵指导员李宝瑢一事，该县领导机关已派人作了调查。证明李宝瑢等揭发的情况基本上是正确的；已对有贪污行为的村干部李宝林作了处理，并对区长房子恒提出批评，责令深刻检讨。桓台县五区东沙河村群众联名控告乡干部贪污违法行为的问题，中共桓台县委和桓台县人民政府也改变了置之不理的态度，都派人进行了调查处理。
    但是，应该指出：目前山东省还有不少县区干部对待来自下面的批评、建议的态度是极不正确的。他们在处理人民来信和接待人民来访的工作中，也表现了令人不能容忍的官僚主义态度，甚至还发生严重违法乱纪的行为。
    有些县区干部对于人民的来信和报纸上的批评，采取对立、仇视的态度。他们认为批评者写信“未经审查”，是“目无组织”、“自高自大”，或者藉口“批评有出入”、“批评者动机不纯”等，对批评者进行压制和打击。如平阴县三区龙洼村小学教师张冠五给他人代笔写信给我们农村大众报社，控告村干部张尔朱打掉孕妇胎儿的非法行为。农村大众报在八月发表此信后，该区文教助理员派民兵将代笔人、控告人传到乡人民政府非法审讯，并斥责代笔人写稿未经区里审查，是“目无组织、轻视领导”，强令反省检讨。这个严重压制批评、侵犯人权的事件，经报社调查属实，上级领导机关已作了处理。
    某些党政机关的干部，对处理人民的来信和接待人民来访，不是采取认真和热情的态度，而是采取置之不理、推出不管的官僚主义态度。如历城县三区大杜家村农民杜殿文，为了该县砖瓦窑业税与邻近的章历县不统一的问题，到本区税务所询问两次，该所不予答复。他到历城县税务局问，县税务局又不理。他到淄博专署税务局问，专署税务局还是置之不理。最后他写信询问省税务局，才得到了答复。省税务局并指示章历县税务局派人检查砖瓦窑业税问题。再如益都县十五区堂子村读报组组员王义亭为了搞好读报工作，曾三次到中共益都县委宣传部联系，但总是不能进去。每次他都到县委机关的人民问事处去，该处同志不是说机关没有人，就是说开会不得闲，将他支走算完。像这样的干部，怎样能够做好人民问事处的工作呢？怎样能够通过他们的工作来密切党与群众的联系呢？这说明：某些机关设立的人民问事处，由于没有派群众观点较强的干部到那里去工作，问事处还是个形式。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    某些机关对人民的申诉、控告，不是根据自己的权限职责作认真负责的处理，而是藉口“问题复杂”，互相推诿，致使公文长期“旅行”或案件一拖再拖，不能解决。如泰安县十一区孙家沟村农民赵家柱在七、八月间向该县人民法院控告副乡长张凤山违法乱纪。人民法院把这个事件推到县委纪律检查委员会；该会又推到文教科……。案件拖了一个多月，控告人到人民法院催了七次；人民法院置之不理，而案件也不知推到那里去了。他在九月中旬把这件事的经过写信告诉我们农村大众报，报社当即转请泰安专署处理，十月底又曾去信催办，但到现在还没见到复信。又如黄县十一区七甲村王昌茂因控告本村党支部书记霸占其侄子的房子而遭到报复的问题，曾经到区委会去要求解决，后又屡次到县委会控诉，但终未解决。他到莱阳地委控告七次，并去信数次；最后又亲自到省人民检察署控告一次，去信数次，但是问题还是没有得到处理。这问题一直拖了二年。今年九月，王昌茂写信要求我们农村大众报协助解决，我们已转请人民日报读者来信组处理（本报已在九月二十三日函请山东省人民监察委员会负责处理这一事件，并曾在十月十四、十一月三日先后去信催办，但到现在还没得到复信。希望山东省人民监察委员会迅速负责处理。
    ——编者）。
    这种对待批评的错误态度和官僚主义作风已经严重影响党和人民政府在人民群众中的威信，破坏了党和政府与人民群众的联系。因此，我建议山东省党政领导机关严重注意这个问题，迅速采取有效的办法，教育干部切实纠正上述错误行为，使中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”以及中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”的精神能更好地贯彻。
