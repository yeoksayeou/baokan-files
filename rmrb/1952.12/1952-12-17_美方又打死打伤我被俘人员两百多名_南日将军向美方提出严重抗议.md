    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: General Nan Ri, Chief Delegate of our Delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side on December 16 regarding the bloody incident on December 14, in which the U.S. side massacred our captured personnel on a large scale at the Pongam-do POW camp. The full text of the protest is as follows:
    Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation:
    On December 14, your side killed 82 of our captured personnel and wounded 120 of our captured personnel at the Pongam-do POW camp. I lodge a serious protest with you regarding this bloody incident. This large-scale massacre of our captured personnel by your side has once again revealed to the people of the world the essence of your excuse for refusing to repatriate prisoners of war. Your sabotage of the armistice negotiations, refusal of a Korean armistice, and the insane massacre of our captured personnel completely prove your determination to prolong and expand the Korean War. Your side will never be able to escape full responsibility for all these war crimes.
    General Nan Ri, Chief Delegate
    Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: On December 14, the U.S. side once again carried out a large-scale collective massacre of our captured personnel at the Pongam-do POW camp. A total of 82 of our POWs were killed and 120 were wounded. The number of POWs killed this time reached the highest peak of all the massacre incidents that the U.S. side has been forced to admit. The U.S. side is fabricating loopholes and vague lies to cover up this latest barbaric massacre of unarmed prisoners of war. However, the fact is: Since the U.S. side suffered heavy casualties on the battlefield and plotted the sinister method of "using Asians to fight Asians," they have been wantonly arresting prisoners of war by force in many POW camps and forcibly transferring them to the Lee Seung-man gang to serve as cannon fodder. This new massacre incident is a new barbaric attack on prisoners of war that began after Eisenhower personally came to Korea to plot this conspiracy. And the prisoners of war in this POW camp are those whom the U.S. side had long intended to hand over to the Lee gang, but insisted that they were "detained civilians." According to the U.S. side, their bloody plan was carefully prepared. Many days before the massacre, "Allied guards had been deployed on alert." On the 14th, fully armed U.S. and Lee puppet troops simultaneously began operations in six camp areas, using machine guns, carbines, and pistols to massacre prisoners of war who loved their motherland. Facing the "hail of Allied bullets," the unarmed prisoners of war in each camp area put up a heroic and moving resistance. When many prisoners of war were compressed on top of a towering high ground and subjected to a collective massacre by the U.S. army, they still bravely resisted hand in hand, preferring to die rather than yield. The U.S. side's attempt to describe the prisoners of war's heroic resistance to forced detention as "intentional obstruction" cannot deceive anyone. In fact, under the cover of news censorship, the U.S. side has constantly used massacre to forcibly transfer prisoners of war to the Lee Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to serve as cannon fodder. More and more evidence of this is in the hands of the Korean and Chinese sides.
    The signboard of "no forced repatriation," which the U.S. side uses to refuse negotiations and expand the war, is increasingly covered with the blood of hundreds and thousands of prisoners of war. Since January of this year, according to figures disclosed by the U.S. side alone, 1,900 prisoners of war have been killed or wounded. If we add the numbers reported by prisoners of war forced to serve as airborne commandos, and the figures disclosed by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a tool of the U.S. side, the total number of prisoners of war killed or wounded reaches nearly 3,000. These increasingly cruel and bloody facts expose how hypocritical and sinister the illegal resolution recently passed by the United Nations General Assembly is. The U.S. side's attempt to deceive the world with this proposal, which is disguised with beautiful words but actually approves the U.S. side's violation of all international conventions, will never be realized.

    美方又打死打伤我被俘人员两百多名
    南日将军向美方提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十二月十六日对美方十二月十四日在蜂岩岛战俘营大规模屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事件向对方提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    十二月十四日你方在蜂岩岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员八十二人，打伤我方被俘人员一百二十人，对此次血腥事件，我向你提出严重抗议。此次你方大规模屠杀我方被俘人员的野蛮行为，又一次向世界人民揭露了你方拒绝遣返战俘的藉口的实质。你方破坏停战谈判，拒绝朝鲜停战，疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员，完全证明你方决意延长与扩大朝鲜战争。你方将永远不能逃脱这一切战争罪行的完全责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
    首席代表南日将军
        一九五二年十二月十六日
    【新华社开城十六日电】十二月十四日美方又在蜂岩岛战俘营内大规模地集体屠杀我方被俘人员。共打死我方战俘八十二人，打伤一百二十人。这一次被打死的战俘的数字，达到了美方历次被迫承认的屠杀事件的最高峰。美方正在捏造漏洞百出和含混不清的谎言，来掩饰这又一次对赤手空拳的战俘的野蛮大屠杀。但是，事实是：自美方在战场上伤亡惨重，策划“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴险办法以来，就在许多战俘营内用武力大肆拘捕战俘，强迫把他们移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。这一新的屠杀事件，正是在艾森豪威尔亲自到朝鲜来策划这一阴谋后，开始对战俘进行的新的野蛮进攻。而这个战俘营的战俘，也就是美方早已蓄意把他们移交给李匪帮，而硬说他们是“被拘留平民”的。据美方透露：他们的这一个血腥计划是经过周密准备的。在屠杀前许多天，“联军警卫已布下警戒”。在十四日，全付武装的美军和李伪军，就在六个营场内同时开始行动，用机关枪、卡宾枪、手枪屠杀热爱祖国的战俘。面对着“如雹一般打来的联军子弹”，各个营场赤手空拳的战俘进行了可歌可泣的抵抗。当许多战俘被压缩在一块高耸的台地顶上，遭到美方军队集体屠杀时，仍手挽着手英勇抵抗，宁死不屈。美方希图把战俘坚决抗御强迫扣留的英勇行为说成是“有意阻难”，是骗不住任何人的。其实，美方在新闻封锁的掩盖下，曾不断地用屠杀的手段，强迫把战俘移交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。这种证据已愈来愈多地掌握在朝中方面手里。
    美方用以拒绝谈判、扩大战争的“不得强迫遣返”的招牌上，已经愈来愈多地洒满了成千成百的战俘的鲜血。自今年一月以来，仅据美方透露的数字，已打死打伤战俘一千九百名。若加上被迫充当空降特务的战俘所报告的，和美方御用组织红十字国际委员会所透露的数字，打死打伤的战俘共达近三千人之多。这些一次比一次残酷的鲜血淋淋的事实，揭穿了联合国大会最近所通过的非法决议是多么伪善和阴险。美方希图借这个用漂亮字眼伪装起来，实际上是批准美方破坏一切国际公约的提案来欺骗全世界，是永远不能实现的。
