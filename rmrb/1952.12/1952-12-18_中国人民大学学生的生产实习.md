    Production Internship of Students at Renmin University of China
    Ji Huaimin
    Production internship is an organic component of the entire teaching process. It differs from general visits and also from the pure operation of bourgeois pragmatism. Its task is to consolidate the theoretical knowledge of the students' major and enable them to acquire the skilled techniques of applying theoretical knowledge to practice. This method of verifying theoretical knowledge through practice, and then enriching one's learning from practice, is built on the scientific foundation of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Chairman Mao said: "Marxists hold that only social practice can be the criterion of truth for people's knowledge of the external world. The actual situation is that only when people achieve the results they expected in their thinking in the process of social practice (in the process of material production, in the process of class struggle, in the process of scientific experiment) is their understanding confirmed." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. 1, p. 283) Comrade Stalin also said: "The principles of science are always tested by practice and experience. If science is divorced from practice and experience, what kind of science is it? If science is something like what some of our conservative comrades describe, then it would have long been useless to mankind." ("Speech at the First All-Union Stakhanovite Workers Conference") Based on this spirit, Renmin University of China, according to the experience of Soviet higher education institutions, stipulates that students in all undergraduate departments should engage in production internships after studying a certain major. The first production internship is conducted when students have completed two or three years of study; the second production internship is conducted when students have completed all their studies.

    In June of this year, nearly 500 second-year students from the Departments of Factory Management, Economic Planning, Finance, Cooperative, and Trade of Renmin University of China successfully completed their first production internship. This internship was divided into thirteen specialized courses and forty-five internship groups, conducted in forty-eight factories, mines, farms, oil fields, cooperatives, and enterprise organs in North China, East China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Thanks to the strong support of relevant ministries and commissions of the Central Government and the relevant factories, mines, and enterprise organs, as well as the direct assistance of Soviet professors and the efforts of participating teachers and students, we have achieved certain results and gained some experience. However, mainly because we lack experience in applying this advanced Soviet teaching method, there are still many shortcomings.

    A total of 499 students participated in this internship, of whom about 80 percent were cadres who had been engaged in revolutionary work for many years, about 15 percent were young intellectuals, and about 5 percent were industrial workers. Most of them originally had a low level of education and lacked professional knowledge. After two years of theoretical study at Renmin University of China, they were generally able to make relatively complete production internship reports according to the established production internship outline. For example, Yuan Hui and Chen Zhipeng, students from the coal mining class of the Factory Management Department, were both workers from Kailuan Coal Mine in the past. They had no opportunity to study in the old society, and their cultural level was not even up to junior high school before entering the university. After two years of study, they wrote relatively complete internship reports during the production internship. The technical part of the report included machine structure diagrams drawn to certain specifications, and analyzed and explained using materials. Many students from the Cooperative Department who were from peasant backgrounds were also able to write excellent internship reports based on the outline during the internship. As a result of the assessment, most of the students participating in the production internship in the whole school achieved excellent results, and none failed. This further proves that the teaching policy of Renmin University of China is completely correct, and that the training of new-type worker-peasant intellectuals is effective. It also shows that the advanced teaching method of production internship is in line with the requirements of new-type higher education.

    In addition, it can be seen from the students' reactions that production internship is an effective teaching method that combines theory with practice. Many students said: In the past, it was often not easy to thoroughly understand technology learned in books. After the production internship, textbook knowledge became living knowledge. Some said, "Production internship further digested what was learned in the classroom," and "Production internship solved the problem of how to apply theory to practical work," and so on. This shows that production internship not only achieved the purpose of verifying the theoretical knowledge learned through practice, but also enriched the content of the students' courses.

    During the internship, the participating teachers and students collected more than 600 kinds of models, specimens, and materials, which enriched the reference rooms of each teaching and research office. This is of great help to teachers in compiling teaching materials and engaging in scientific research. At the same time, the production internship also tested the course content of Renmin University of China, proving that the course content of Renmin University of China is basically in line with the needs of various aspects of New China's construction. However, it also exposed some serious shortcomings of Renmin University of China in compiling teaching materials. For example, in individual technical courses, some outdated materials from our country were compiled into the teaching materials. Renmin University of China has quickly corrected these shortcomings.

    The students saw all aspects of the motherland's construction during the internship, which enhanced their enthusiasm and confidence in learning. Some of them visited model workers in factories and mines, held seminars with worker activists, and received vivid patriotic education.

    The main shortcoming of this internship is that a few teaching and research offices did not conduct careful research when compiling the production internship outline, nor did they actively seek the consent of factories, mines, and enterprise organs, so that the plan had to be changed temporarily during the internship. The contact with factories, mines, and enterprise organs was also not close enough, and most internship groups failed to secure the appointment of production internship leaders from factories, mines, and enterprise organs. Some individual internship groups reduced the content of the production internship to the level of merely listening to reports or visiting, which is also a major shortcoming. These shortcomings were caused by the failure of the leaders of some internship groups to strictly follow the principles of advanced Soviet experience in carrying out their work, which had a certain impact on the quality of the production internship.

    Our experience from the first production internship is roughly as follows:

    1. Regarding the preparation for production internship: In Soviet higher education institutions, the preparation work for production internship is regarded as very important. During the preparation period, each teaching and research office of the internship major is required to formulate a comprehensive and scientific production internship outline, "and according to the production internship outline, appropriately consider the internship location and conditions, and formulate a work plan for students in each enterprise or institution. The plan must be made by the production internship leader no later than one week before the student internship, and obtain the consent of the enterprise or institution" ("Soviet Higher Education Institutions" Chapter 7). The production internship of Renmin University of China is carried out according to this principle. This principle requires that before the internship begins, a meticulous and series of preparation work must be carried out, starting from the formulation of the production internship outline and production internship plan. The department head and the director of the teaching and research office must repeatedly study with the lecturer of each internship professional course, and actively obtain the consent of the relevant factories, mines, and enterprise organs, and strive to formulate a very complete and practical outline and plan. Experience has shown that if the outline and plan are well-defined, the harvest of the production internship will be great, otherwise difficulties will inevitably be encountered in the internship process. For example, when the petroleum class of the Factory Management Department of Renmin University of China interned in Yumen, Gansu, they studied and revised the internship outline with the relevant leading organs in advance, and the internship result was very satisfactory and the harvest was great. However, when the machinery class interned in Shenyang, the production internship effect was affected because they did not discuss enough with the factory, so they had to temporarily change the plan. Therefore, in the preparation work of production internship, the contact with various factories, mines, and enterprise organs plays a decisive role in the production internship. Of course, this contact is not only limited to consulting the outline and revising the plan, but more importantly, actively obtaining the strong help and support of all relevant factories, mines, and enterprise organs. It is necessary to clear the way from the highest leading organs of the enterprise to the lower-level factories, mines, and workshops, so that each enterprise attaches importance to the students' production internship work and regards it as its own work. We have a relatively deep understanding of this issue in the first production internship. For example, when the students of the electrical industry class of the Factory Management Department interned at the Tianjin Power Plant, they got a lot of convenience because of the personal leadership of the director of the power plant. Originally, the internship in the motor equipment part must be able to see the whole picture only when the power plant is overhauled; however, the power plant overhaul work is not carried out frequently, which is a big difficulty. With the help of the director of the factory, this difficulty was successfully resolved. When the director learned that a certain motor was being overhauled, he notified the students to go at night, so as to ensure the complete solution of the internship requirements. There are also examples of this kind. The factory casually assigned a technician or skilled worker to guide the students' production internship. In this case, the students' internship requirements cannot be met. From these examples, it is not difficult to understand that it is extremely important to obtain the leadership and support of responsible cadres from factories, mines, and enterprise organs in the preparation work for production internship. In terms of close relationship with factories, mines, and enterprise organs, some of our departments have further adopted the method of signing contracts with factories, mines, and enterprise organs to strive for each factory and mine as a fixed place for school internships in the future. Facts show that this method is the most effective way to obtain the leadership and support of enterprise departments and to closely relate the two parties.

    2. Regarding the leadership of the production internship: The administrative leadership of the production internship work in the whole school of Renmin University of China is responsible by the production internship group of the Academic Affairs Department, and the leadership within the department is responsible by the department head. The tasks of the production internship group are to formulate the school's production internship plan and budget book, and to urge and assist each department and relevant factories, mines, and enterprises to carry out contact, check and supervise the progress of production internships in various places, and promptly submit reports on the progress of production internships to the Minister of Academic Affairs and the President. The task of the department head is to urge the formulation of the internship plan and production internship outline within the department, assign the internship leading teachers, decide on the list of interns, and so on. But this is just the general administrative leadership of the production internship, and the specific leadership of each professional internship group, such as the guidance of general learning methods and the examination of students' internship results, must be undertaken by the teachers with the strongest business skills assigned by the teaching and research office of each major. As for the actual technical leadership of the production internship, it is necessary to rely on skilled specialized talents assigned by factories, mines, and enterprises. In Soviet higher education institutions, "the teaching method part of the production internship is the responsibility of the teachers, and the production technology part is the responsibility of the heads of the enterprises and the experts in charge" ("Soviet Higher Education Institutions" Chapter 1), "the student's internship report and diary must be reviewed and signed by the internship leader before the student leaves the enterprise" ("Soviet Higher Education Institutions" Chapter 7). In this regard, we failed to fully do so in the first production internship. But experience has shown that it is correct to rely on skilled experts from factories and mines to serve as the general leader of the internship, because only in this way can interns obtain real practical work experience and technology. Secondly, from the comments of the leaders of each enterprise on the students' internship reports, the school can examine the students' degree of understanding of the theory they have learned, so as to improve and improve the quality of teaching. The reason why Renmin University of China failed to do this completely in this regard is that the leading teachers of each internship group failed to vigorously strive for it, but the main reason is that most factories, mines, and enterprise organs in China currently do not have a certain organization and method for receiving students' production internships, and individual enterprises emphasize that production tasks are busy and do not pay enough attention to students' production internships.

    3. Regarding the work form of production internship: According to the experience of the Soviet Union and in combination with the specific situation of various enterprises in our country, Renmin University of China has adopted the following work forms for production internship: First, according to the production internship outline, study and understand the general situation, history, and characteristics of the relevant factories, mines, and enterprise organs, and then collect data separately according to the items stipulated in the outline or verify the theoretical knowledge of the students' major learned in school through actual work, so as to obtain new knowledge and technology. During the internship, interns are required to strictly implement the provisions of the outline and ensure that all are completed. At the end of each day of internship, interns must keep a diary to record their completed work. At the same time, in order to help interns complete the internship task completely, during the production internship, the teachers in charge of leading the production internship should appropriately organize interns to visit the affiliated workshops or units related to the factory, mine, and enterprise. In addition, enterprise leaders should be invited to make special reports or answer questions raised by interns, and theoretical studies and seminars with model workers should be organized and guided for interns. At the end of the entire internship, interns must submit a production internship report. This report must be reviewed by the enterprise leader and given written comments in order to facilitate the teacher's examination and evaluation of the intern's production internship results (evaluated according to the four-level system). When evaluating the results, the teacher can also raise temporary questions in order to more comprehensively understand the student's level.

    When the interns leave the factory, mine, and enterprise organs, they should also be organized to make rationalization proposals to the enterprise.

    The above internship steps are still general principles, and each internship group will of course stipulate some activities that meet the requirements according to different professional characteristics. But it must be explained that the students' production internship is mainly for students to independently complete the internship task according to the outline. The internship leader can only help and guide the interns, and cannot have any actions that replace or similar to replacing the students' internship. For example, organizing too many reports or visits, limiting interns to just listening or watching, rather than actually engaging in production activities, etc., will inevitably reduce the quality of the production internship and fail to achieve the expected results. Individual internship groups at Renmin University of China had this shortcoming in the first production internship. The school plans to correct this in future production internships.

    4. Selection of factories, mines, and enterprise organs: "Production internships must be organized in better enterprises and various departments of the national economy, in schools, in better rural areas and local hospitals, affiliated hospitals ... collective farms, academies of sciences and other organs" ("Soviet Higher Education Institutions" Chapter 7). When selecting factories, mines, or enterprise organs for production internship, Renmin University of China absorbed Soviet experience, combined with the specific situation of our country, and carried out according to the following two principles: First, give priority to selecting qualified factories, mines, and enterprise organs locally (that is, near the school); second, select factories, mines, and enterprise organs with complete and relatively advanced technical equipment. These two principles are combined. The former facilitates the school's nearby leadership and saves national funds, while the latter ensures that the quality of the internship is not reduced by simply being restricted by the region. Especially Renmin University of China, which is learning from the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union in all aspects, must carry out production internships in more advanced enterprises, because the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is also being vigorously promoted in advanced enterprises or factories, which is more realistic for the combination with professional courses, and the harvest will inevitably be greater. For example, the coal mining class of the Factory Management Department interned in Fushun, Northeast China, the famous coal capital of China. There are shaft coal mining and open-pit coal mining, and complete affiliated production equipment such as steel plants and oil refineries, which makes it easy for students to fully understand the production process; at the same time, Fushun Longfeng Mine is promoting the advanced Soviet "periodic coal mining method", which also facilitates interns to understand the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    5. Regarding confidentiality and safety issues: When students go to state-owned factories or enterprise organs for production internship, the leaders of the internship must repeatedly educate the interns to keep state secrets. Because keeping state secrets is a quality that every member of the country must possess, especially in the internship, interns inevitably come into contact with many materials that belong to state secrets. To this end, Renmin University of China stipulates that interns must not write confidential materials in reports or diaries, and the leaders are responsible for checking them.

    The safety of interns is also very important. Because students generally lack production knowledge and are not familiar with the site conditions. In order to ensure the safety of interns, before the internship begins, the person in charge of the factory, mine, and enterprise organ should be asked to report on safety issues, especially for mine internships and gunpowder field internships. Renmin University of China has formulated rules for students' production internship, requiring every intern to strictly abide by them. In addition to this, students must also be required to become models of obeying all production disciplines of factories, mines, and enterprise organs.

    Production internship is an advanced teaching method of Soviet higher education, but the application of this method is only a beginning at Renmin University of China, and the experience is not yet mature, and it needs to be actively improved and improved in the future; but this teaching method has proved to be applicable and effective for Renmin University of China, and is therefore worthy of introduction and promotion. Our country is about to fully launch large-scale economic construction, so the central task of national higher education institutions is to train more and more effectively national construction cadres. Chairman Mao taught us to "take Russia as a teacher." As long as we are good at learning and applying the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union, we will surely win victory.

    中国人民大学学生的生产实习
    纪怀民
    生产实习，是整个教学过程中的一个有机组成部分，它既不同于一般的参观，又区别于资产阶级实用主义的单纯操作。它的任务在于巩固学生所学专业的理论知识，并使他们获得把理论知识应用于实践的熟练技巧。这种把理论知识通过实践去印证，然后再从实践中去丰富自己的学习方法，是建筑在辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的科学基础上的。毛主席说：“马克思主义者认为，只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准。实际的情形是这样的，只有在社会实践过程中（物质生产过程中，阶级斗争过程中，科学实验过程中），人们达到了思想中所预想的结果时，人们的认识才被证实了。”（“毛泽东选集”第一卷二八三页）斯大林同志也说过：“科学的原理向来都是由实践、由经验来考验的。如果科学和实践断绝了关系，和经验断绝了关系，那它还算是什么科学呢？如果科学就是像我们某些保守主义同志所形容的那样的一种东西，那它对于人类岂不是早已没有什么作用了么。”（“在第一次全苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者会议上的演说”）正是基于这种精神，中国人民大学根据苏联高等学校的经验，规定大学本科各系的学生在学过一定的专业以后都要进行生产实习。第一次生产实习是在学生修业届满两年或三年时进行；第二次生产实习，则在学生修业全部终了时进行。
    今年六月间中国人民大学本科工厂管理系、经济计划系、财政系、合作社系、贸易系五个系的二年级学生近五百人已经胜利地完成了第一次生产实习。这次实习是分十三个专业课程，四十五个实习组，分别在华北、华东、东北、西北等地的四十八处工厂、矿山、农场、油田、合作社和企业机关进行的。由于中央有关各部、会和各该厂矿、企业机关的有力支持，以及苏联教授们的直接帮助和参加实习师生的努力，我们已经获得了一定的成绩，也取得了若干经验。然而主要的是由于我们在运用苏联的这一先进教学方法上还缺乏经验，缺点还是不少的。
    这次参加实习的学生共四百九十九人，其中从事革命工作多年的干部约占百分之八十，青年知识分子约占百分之十五，产业工人约占百分之五。他们绝大部分原先文化水平较低，更无专业知识，在中国人民大学经过两年的理论学习，一般地都能按照既定的生产实习纲要，比较完整地作出生产实习报告。例如工厂管理系采煤班的学生袁惠、陈志鹏，过去都是开滦煤矿的工人，在旧社会他们没有读书的机会，入校前尚不够初中的文化水平，经过两年学习，在生产实习中写出了比较完整的实习报告，报告中的技术部分，都绘制了合乎一定规格的机器构造图，并运用材料作了分析说明。合作社系有不少农民出身的学生，在实习中也都能依据纲要写出很好的实习报告。评定的结果，全校参加生产实习的学生，大多数成绩优良，并且没有不及格的。这进一步证明了中国人民大学的教学方针是完全正确的，培养工农新型知识分子是有成效的。从而也说明了生产实习这一先进的教学方法，切合新型高等教育的要求。
    另外，从学生的反应中也可以看出，生产实习是理论联系实际的有效教学方法。许多学生说：过去在书本上学技术往往不容易透澈了解，经过生产实习，书本知识变成了活生生的知识。有的说：“生产实习把课堂上所学的进一步消化了”，“生产实习解决了理论怎样运用到实际工作中这个问题”等等。这说明了生产实习不仅达到了通过实践去印证所学理论知识的目的，而且丰富了学生所学的课程内容。
    在实习中，参加实习的师生搜集了模型、标本和资料共六百多种，充实了各教学研究室的资料室，这对教员编写讲义和从事科学研究工作有很大的帮助。同时，通过生产实习，也检验了中国人民大学的课程内容，证明中国人民大学的课程内容基本上是切合新中国各方面建设的需要的。但也暴露了中国人民大学在编写讲义中的某些严重缺点，例如在个别技术课程中，曾把我国的某些陈旧的材料编到了讲义里面。这些缺点，中国人民大学已迅速予以修正。
    学生在实习中看到了祖国建设的各个方面，增强了学习的热情和信心。他们有的在厂矿中访问了劳动模范，和工人积极分子举行了座谈会，受到了生动的爱国主义教育。
    这次实习的主要缺点，是少数教学研究室在编制生产实习纲要时，没有经过仔细研究，也没有主动征得厂矿企业机关的同意，以致在实习进行中不得不临时变更计划。在和厂矿企业机关的联系上也嫌不够周密，大部分实习组未能争取到厂矿企业机关指派生产实习的领导人。个别实习组把生产实习的内容降低到仅仅是听报告或参观的水平，这也是一个很大的缺点。这些缺点，是由于某些实习组的领导人未严格遵照苏联先进经验的原则进行工作所产生的，给了生产实习的质量以一定影响。
    我们第一次生产实习的经验，大致如下：
    一、关于生产实习的准备：在苏联高等学校中，把生产实习的准备工作看得十分重要。在准备期间，要求各该实习专业的教学研究室制定全面的、科学的生产实习纲要，“并根据生产实习纲要，适当地考虑实习地点和条件，制定学生在各该企业或机关中的工作计划。计划最迟须在学生实习前一周内，由生产实习领导人制成，并征得企业或该机关的同意”（“苏联高等学校”第七章）。中国人民大学的生产实习就是根据这一原则进行的。这一原则要求：在实习开始之前，首先进行缜密的、一系列的准备工作，从制订生产实习纲要和生产实习计划开始，系主任和教学研究室主任就要和各该实习专业课程的主讲教员反复研究，并主动取得有关厂矿企业机关的同意，务求订出十分完整和切合实际的纲要和计划。经验证明：如果纲要和计划订得好，生产实习的收获就大，否则在实习过程中就必然遭遇困难。比如中国人民大学工厂管理系石油班在甘肃玉门实习时，事先就把实习纲要和有关领导机关进行了研究，作了修订，实习结果很圆满，收获很大。而机械班在沈阳实习时，由于和厂方商量得不够，以致不得不临时变更计划，生产实习的效果也因而受了影响。因此在生产实习的准备工作中，和各厂矿企业机关的联系问题，对生产实习起着决定性的作用。当然这种联系并不仅仅限于磋商纲要和修订计划，而更重要的，是主动取得各有关厂矿企业机关的大力帮助和支持，要从企业最上层的领导机关直到下层的厂矿、车间，层层打通，使各企业把学生的生产实习工作重视起来，看作是自己的工作的
    一部分，对这个问题，我们在第一次生产实习中有比较深刻的体会。例如工厂管理系电业班的同学在天津发电厂实习时，就因为发电厂厂长的亲身领导而得到了很大的方便。本来，在电机设备部分的实习，是必须在电厂检修时方能窥其全貌的；但电厂检修工作不是经常进行的，这是一个很大的困难。由于有厂长的帮助，这一困难顺利地解决了。当厂长了解到某处电机进行检修时，就在夜间通知学生前往，这样就保证了实习要求的完满解决。另外也有这种例子，厂方随便指派一个技术员或熟练工人指导学生的生产实习，在这种情况下，就不能满足学生的实习要求。从这些事例中，不难了解，在生产实习准备工作中取得厂矿企业机关负责干部的领导和支持是极其重要的。在和厂矿企业机关密切关系这方面，我们有的系还进一步采取了和厂矿企业机关订立合同的办法，争取各厂、矿作为学校今后实习的固定地点。事实说明，这种方式，是取得企业部门领导、支持和密切双方关系的一个最有效的方法。
    二、关于生产实习的领导：中国人民大学全校范围的生产实习工作的行政领导，是由教务部的生产实习组负责的，而系范围内的领导则由系主任负责。生产实习组的工作任务，是制订全校生产实习计划及经费预算书，并督促协助各系和有关厂矿企业进行联系，检查和监督各地生产实习的进度，及时向教务部长及校长提出生产实习工作进行的报告书等等。系主任的任务则是督促制订系范围内的实习计划和生产实习纲要，指派实习的领导教员，决定实习生名单等等。但这不过是生产实习的一般行政领导，而对各个专业实习组的具体领导，例如一般学习方法的指导以及对学生实习成绩的考察等等，则要由各该专业的教学研究室指派业务最强的教员来担任。至于生产实习的实际技术领导，则必须依靠厂矿企业中指派熟练的专门人材来担任。在苏联高等学校，“生产实习之教学方法部分由教员负责，而生产技术部分则由各企业首长及负责领导之专家负责”（“苏联高等学校”第一章），“学生的实习报告以及日记，在学生离开企业前须经实习领导人审阅及签证”（“苏联高等学校”第七章）。在这一方面，我们在第一次生产实习时未能完全做到。但经验证明，依靠厂矿的熟练专家担任实习总领导的办法是正确的，因为只有这样做，实习生才能获得真正的实际工作经验和技术。其次，从各该企业领导人审阅学生实习报告的评语，学校方面可以考察学生对所学理论的理解程度，从而提高和改进教学质量。中国人民大学在这方面所以未能完全做好，原因是：各实习组的领导教员未能大力争取，但主要的原因还是目前中国多数厂矿企业机关对接待学生生产实习尚无一定的机构和办法，个别企业单位则强调生产任务忙，而对学生生产实习重视不够。
    三、关于生产实习的工作形式：中国人民大学根据苏联的经验，结合我国目前各企业的具体情况，采取了如下的生产实习的工作形式：首先，依据生产实习纲要研究和了解各有关厂矿企业机关的概况、沿革及特点，然后根据纲要所规定的项目，分别搜集资料或通过实际工作去印证学生在校所学专业的理论知识，从而获得新的知识和技术。在实习过程中，要求实习生必须严格执行纲要的规定并保证全部完成。在每日实习终了时，实习生都要做日记，记载自己所完成的工作状况。同时，为了帮助实习生完满地完成实习任务，在生产实习期间，负责领导生产实习的教员应适当组织实习生到附属车间或到和该厂矿企业有关系的单位进行参观。另外，要请企业领导干部作专题报告或解答实习生所提出的问题，并组织和辅导实习生进行理论学习以及和模范工友座谈等。实习生在全部实习终了的时候，必须提出生产实习报告，这份报告要经过企业领导人的审核并予以书面评语，以便于教员考察和评定实习生的生产实习成绩（按照四级分制评定）。在进行成绩评定时，教员还可以提出临时质疑，以便更全面地了解学生的程度。
    在实习生离开厂矿企业机关时，还应该组织实习生向企业提出合理化建议。
    以上的这些实习步骤，还是一般的原则，各实习组当然还会依据不同的专业特点，规定若干切合要求的活动。但必须说明，学生的生产实习，主要是要学生依据提纲去独立地完成实习任务，实习领导人对实习生只能是帮助和指导的关系，不能有任何代替或类似代替学生实习的行动。比如过多地组织报告或参观，让实习生仅仅限于听或看，而不是实际地去从事生产活动，等等，这必然会降低生产实习的质量，不能收到预期的效果。中国人民大学第一次生产实习中个别实习组就曾发生这种缺点。该校准备在今后的生产实习中予以纠正。
    四、厂矿企业机关的选择：“生产实习须在较好的企业里和国民经济各部门里，在学校、在较好的农村和地方医院、附属医院……集体农庄、科学院等机关中组织之”（“苏联高等学校”第七章）。中国人民大学在选择进行生产实习的厂矿或企业机关时，是吸取苏联经验，结合我国具体情况，依据下述两个原则进行的：一是尽先选择当地（即学校附近）合乎条件的厂矿企业机关；二是选择技术设备完善而且比较先进的厂矿企业机关。这两个原则是结合的，前者便于学校就近领导和节省国家经费，后者则保证不单纯受地区限制而降低实习质量。特别像中国人民大学，它在各方面都是学习苏联先进建设经验的，因此就一定要在较先进的企业中进行生产实习，因为在先进的企业或工厂中也正在大力推行苏联的先进经验，这样对于与专业课程的结合更具有现实意义，收获也必然会更大。比如工厂管理系的采煤班是在中国著名的煤都东北抚顺进行实习的，这里有竖井采煤和露天采煤，有全面的附属生产设备如炼钢厂、制油厂等等，这使学生容易全面了解生产过程；同时，在抚顺龙凤矿正在推行苏联先进的“周期采煤法”，这也便于实习生体会苏联的先进经验。
    五、关于保密和安全问题：当学生到国家工厂或企业机关中进行生产实习时，实习的领导人要反复地向实习生进行保守国家机密的教育。因为保守国家机密是每一个国家成员必须具备的品质，特别在实习中，实习生不可避免地要接触许多属于国家机密的材料。为此中国人民大学规定实习生不得将保密材料写在报告书或日记中，并由领导人负责予以检查。
    实习生的安全问题也是十分重要的。因为学生一般的缺乏生产知识，不熟悉现场情况。为了保障实习生的安全，在实习开始之前，要先请厂矿企业机关负责人作安全问题的报告，特别像矿井实习、火药场实习，更须如此。中国人民大学曾制定了学生生产实习规则，要求每一个实习生严格遵守，除此以外，还要要求学生成为服从厂矿企业机关一切生产纪律的模范。
    生产实习是苏联高等教育的先进教学方法，但运用这种方法，在中国人民大学还仅仅是个开端，经验还不够成熟，需要今后积极地予以改进和提高；但这种教学方法已证明对中国人民大学是适用的，有效的，因而是值得介绍和推广的。我国即将全面展开大规模的经济建设，因而更多地和更有效地培养国家建设干部，乃是全国高等学校的中心任务，毛主席教导我们“以俄为师”，只要我们善于学习和运用苏联的先进教学经验，我们就一定会获得胜利。
