    Xinhua News Agency Report: The Preparatory Committee of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province held an enlarged meeting in Nanning City from November 6th to 10th. One hundred and twenty-one representatives from various ethnic groups in the Guixi area attended the meeting, including Zhuang, Han, Yao, Miao, Dong, Pian, Lai, Hui, Gelao, and Mulam ethnic groups. Liu Geping, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, Zhang Zhiyi, Chairman of the Central and South Military and Political Committee Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Ma Jie, leader of the Central Nationalities Inspection Group, went to provide guidance. Chen Manyuan, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, representatives of cadres from Guangxi Province and Nanning City agencies, and many minority ethnic guests from other regions of Guangxi Province also attended the meeting.
    Liu Geping, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, made a report at the meeting. He first extended warm congratulations to the meeting. He pointed out that after the establishment of the autonomous region, the Zhuang people, under the leadership of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, would surely be able to achieve further development. Liu Geping also conveyed the report by Li Weihan, Chairman of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, on "Several Issues Concerning Nationalities Policy." Finally, he put forward four hopes for all cadres and people in Guangxi Province: First, Han cadres and people should help the Zhuang people do a good job in the construction of the autonomous region; second, the Zhuang people should better unite with the Han people and learn from the Han people with an open mind; third, the Zhuang people should help other minority ethnic peoples in the autonomous region; fourth, all cadres should strengthen the study of nationalities policy and vigorously publicize it to the people of all ethnic groups. The meeting also heard reports by Zhang Zhiyi, Chairman of the Central and South Military and Political Committee Nationalities Affairs Commission, on "Nationalities Policy," Zhao Zhuoyun, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee, on "Three Years of Nationalities Work in Guangxi Province," and Qin Yingji, Director of the Preparatory Committee, on "Preparatory Work for the Implementation of Regional Autonomy in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region." When discussing these reports, the representatives put forward the hopes and demands of the people of all ethnic groups in the spirit of "saying everything they know and saying it without reservation." The representatives unanimously believed that in order to better strengthen national unity and develop the political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings of the Zhuang people, it is entirely correct to prepare for the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region today, and it is also the universal demand of the more than six million people in Guixi. Huang Lianhui, a Zhuang female representative from Tiandong County, said at the plenary meeting: "In order to stand up and be masters of our own affairs, the people of our Tiandong County, under the leadership of Chairman Zhang Yunyi in the past, worked together for many years of revolution, regardless of Zhuang, Miao, or Yao, just to realize this hope." Huang Zhancai, a Zhuang representative from Shanglin County, said: "In the past, when the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled, we did not dare to admit that we were Zhuang and regarded ourselves as Han people who spoke local dialects. This is because we Zhuang people had no status in the old society. We Zhuang people can have today, which cannot but make people thank our great leader Chairman Mao."
    Finally, Chen Manyuan made a summary of the meeting. He pointed out that it is necessary to further improve the work of national unity after the meeting and to step up the preparatory work for the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in order to welcome the upcoming Guixi People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups.

    桂西僮族自治区筹备委员会举行扩大会议
    中央民族事务委员会副主任委员刘格平等前往指导
    【新华社讯】广西省桂西僮族自治区筹备委员会于十一月六日至十日在南宁市召开扩大会议。出席这次会议的有桂西地区各民族代表一百二十一人，包括僮、汉、瑶、苗、侗、偏、徕、回、仡佬、仫佬等民族成分。中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员刘格平，中南军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员张执一以及中央民族视察组组长马杰等都前往指导。出席会议的还有广西省人民政府副主席陈漫远、广西省和南宁市各机关干部代表和广西省其他地区少数民族来宾多人。
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员刘格平在会上作了报告。他首先对会议致热烈的祝贺。他指出：僮族人民在成立自治区后，在广西省人民政府领导下，一定能够得到进一步的发展。刘格平并传达了中央人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉“有关民族政策的若干问题”的报告，最后并对广西省全体干部和人民提出四点希望：第一，汉族干部和人民要帮助僮族人民做好自治区的建设工作；第二，僮族人民要更好地团结汉族人民，并虚心地向汉族人民学习；第三，僮族人民要帮助自治区内其他各少数民族人民；第四，全体干部要加强民族政策的学习，并大力向各族人民进行宣传。会议还听取了中南军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员张执一关于“民族政策”的报告，自治区筹备委员会副主任赵卓云关于“广西省三年来的民族工作”的报告及筹备委员会主任覃应机关于“桂西僮族实行区域自治筹备工作”的报告。代表们在讨论这些报告时，都以“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神提出了各族人民的希望与要求。代表们一致认为，为了更好地加强民族团结，发展僮族人民的政治、经济、文化等建设事业，在今日筹备成立桂西僮族自治区是完全正确的，同时也是桂西六百余万人民的普遍要求。田东县僮族女代表黄莲辉在全体会议上发言说：“我们田东县人民，为了翻身，为了当家作主人，过去在张云逸主席领导下，不分僮、苗、瑶一块干了多年革命，就是为了实现这个希望。”上林县僮族代表黄展才说：“过去国民党反动派统治时，我们不敢承认自己是僮族，把自己看作讲土话的汉人。这是因为我们僮人在旧社会上没有地位。我们僮族人民能有今天，这不能不叫人感谢我们伟大的领袖毛主席。”
    会议最后由陈漫远作总结。他指出会后必须进一步做好民族团结工作和加紧进行成立桂西僮族自治区各项筹备工作，以迎接即将召开的桂西各族各界人民代表会议。
