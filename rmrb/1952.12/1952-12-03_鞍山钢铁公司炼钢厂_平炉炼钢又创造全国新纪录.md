Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 2nd: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, created a new national record on November 22nd, with the No. 4 open-hearth furnace producing a heat of steel in six hours and nine minutes. The steelmaking time for this new record was four hours and three minutes shorter than the average steelmaking time of all open-hearth furnaces in the plant in October, and two hours and ten minutes shorter than the new record set by the No. 5 open-hearth furnace on November 8th. The steelmaking efficiency reached 11.08 tons per square meter of hearth area, which is 4.93 tons more steel per square meter of hearth area than the average of all open-hearth furnaces in October, and 4.03 tons higher than the new record set by the No. 5 open-hearth furnace on November 8th. The quality of the steel fully met the specifications. The steelmaking time and hearth area utilization coefficient achieved in this new record have far exceeded the output of similar open-hearth furnaces in various capitalist countries and have caught up with the current steelmaking level of general steelmaking open-hearth furnaces in the Soviet Union. This is another significant achievement of the plant's workers in participating in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, following the creation of a new record on November 8th.

After the news of the plant's creation of a new record spread, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions all wrote letters to congratulate the plant's workers. Shen Ce, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, personally delivered a silk banner to the steelmaking workers of the steelmaking plant. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said in its congratulatory letter to the steelmaking plant's workers: "The new national record of six hours and nine minutes of rapid steelmaking that you have created in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is a great contribution to the country's industrialization. It is hoped that all workers, engineers, technicians, staff, and cadres will continue to work hard, consolidate existing achievements, earnestly learn from advanced Soviet experience, thoroughly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and do a good job in safety work to strive for the early completion of the annual national plan and the increase production and practice economy plan." The congratulatory letter from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions stated: "The new steelmaking record created by the steelmaking plant's workers in learning from advanced Soviet experience is of great significance for striving to complete the annual steelmaking task. It is hoped that all workers and technicians will unite as one, cooperate closely, and summarize and promote this experience on the existing basis so that it can be transformed into a working method that all employees can master." The congratulatory letter from the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions stated: "These achievements you have made in the battle are inseparable from your good three-shift unity in production and the mutual assistance established in operation where the work of the next shift is not forgotten by the previous shift. It is hoped that you will consolidate the title of model open-hearth furnace in the production competition, strive for greater victories, and produce more and better steel for the country to welcome large-scale economic construction."

In order to create more and greater achievements to participate in the activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the plant's workers launched a production competition on November 10th. Workers and technicians in each workshop have formulated specific plans for further implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. On December 2nd, all the plant's workers sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to report their new achievements and sent a telegram to Stalin to thank the Soviet Union for its help. At the same time, they proposed to strive to complete the annual national production plan twenty days ahead of schedule on December 10th as a gift to the great Sino-Soviet friendship.

    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂
    平炉炼钢又创造全国新纪录
    【新华社鞍山二日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂在苏联专家热诚帮助下，十一月二十二日四号平炉又创造了六小时零九分钟炼一炉钢的全国新纪录。这次新纪录的炼钢时间，比该厂十月份各个平炉的平均炼钢时间缩短了四小时零三分钟，比该厂五号平炉在十一月八日所创造的新纪录的时间缩短了两小时零十分钟；炼钢效率每一平方公尺的炉底面积达到了十一点零八吨，比十月份各个平炉每一平方公尺炉底面积多出钢四点九三吨，比该厂五号平炉在十一月八日所创的新纪录提高了四点零三吨。钢的质量完全合乎规格。这次新纪录所达到的炼钢时间和炉底面积利用系数，已远远地超过了目前各个资本主义国家同样平炉的产量，赶上了苏联目前一般炼钢平炉的炼钢水平。这是该厂职工在参加“中苏友好月”活动中继十一月八日创造新纪录后所获得的另一重大成就。
    该厂这次创造新纪录的消息传出后，中共鞍山市委员会、鞍山市总工会和东北总工会都写信给该厂职工祝贺，市总工会沈策副主席并亲自送去一面锦旗赠予炼钢厂炼钢工人。中共鞍山市委员会在写给炼钢厂职工的祝贺信中说：“你们在贯彻苏联专家的建议中所创造的六小时零九分钟快速炼钢的全国新纪录，对于国家工业化的贡献是很大的。希望全体工友、工程技术人员、职员和干部，继续努力，巩固现有成果，认真学习苏联先进经验，彻底实行苏联专家建议，并作好安全工作，为争取提前完成全年国家计划与增产节约计划而奋斗。”东北总工会的贺信中说：“炼钢厂的职工学习苏联先进经验创造的炼钢新纪录，对于争取完成全年的炼钢任务是具有重大意义的。希望全体工人和技术人员团结一致，密切合作，在现有基础上总结并推广这一经验，使之变为全体职工所能掌握的工作方法。”鞍山市总工会的贺信中说：“你们在战斗中取得的这些成绩，是与你们在生产中搞好三班团结、在操作中建立了上班不忘下班的团结互助所不能分开的。希望你们在生产竞赛中巩固模范平炉的称号，争取更大的胜利，为国家炼出更多更好的钢铁，来迎接大规模的经济建设。”
    该厂职工为了创造更多更大的成绩来参加“中苏友好月”的活动，他们在十一月十日就展开了生产竞赛，各个车间的工人和技术人员，都制定了进一步贯彻实行苏联专家建议的具体计划。十二月二日，全厂职工特致电毛主席报告他们的新成就，并致电斯大林感谢苏联的帮助；同时，提出要争取在十二月十日提前二十天完成全年国家生产计划，来作为向伟大的中苏友谊的献礼。
