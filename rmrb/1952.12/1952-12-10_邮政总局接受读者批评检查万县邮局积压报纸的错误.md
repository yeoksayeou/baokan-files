　　The General Post Office Accepts Readers' Criticism and Inspects Wanxian Post Office for Errors in Accumulating Newspapers
    Editor: The letter from comrades Zhang Wenlin and Li Zhixiang criticizing the phenomenon of the Wanxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau accumulating newspapers, published in the "Readers' Letters" column on November 23, was very necessary. The serious phenomenon of the Wanxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau accumulating newspapers, which was criticized by reader Yang Zhao in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on October 11, did not receive sufficient attention from the Sichuan Postal Administration for necessary inspection and education, which has allowed the Wanxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau's unserious work style to continue to develop. This is intolerable. In order to thoroughly correct this error, we have instructed the Sichuan Postal Administration to inspect the work of the Wanxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau based on the situation reflected by readers of the People's Daily, strengthen the ideological education of the bureau's employees, and improve the quality of work. Necessary adjustments will also be made in specific issues such as transportation, sealing and distribution, delivery, and other labor organization aspects to help the bureau solve difficulties that they cannot solve themselves, in order to do a good job in distribution work.

　　邮政总局接受读者批评检查万县邮局积压报纸的错误
    编辑同志：十一月二十三日“读者来信”栏发表了张文林、李致祥同志对万县邮电局积压报纸现象的批评信，这是十分必要的。万县邮电局积压报纸的严重现象，经读者杨钊同志十月十一日在重庆新华日报提出批评后，没有引起四川邮政管理局的足够注意，进行必要的检查和教育，以致使万县邮电局的不严肃的工作作风继续发展，这是不能容忍的。为了彻底纠正这一错误，我们已指示四川邮政管理
    局根据人民日报读者反映的情况，检查万县邮电局的工作，加强该局职工的思想教育，提高工作质量。并在具体问题如运输、封发、投递以及其他劳动组织等方面作必要的调整，帮助该局解决它们本
    身无法解决的困难，以做好发行工作。
    中央邮电部邮政总局
