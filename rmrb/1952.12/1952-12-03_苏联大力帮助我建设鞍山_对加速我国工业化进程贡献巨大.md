    The Soviet Union Greatly Helped Us Build Anshan, Making Huge Contributions to Accelerating Our Country's Industrialization
    [Report from this newspaper] In the large-scale construction of Anshan in Northeast China, the Soviet people gave us great and selfless assistance in all aspects. The large-scale construction of Anshan, from design, construction, machine manufacturing and installation to the technical training of personnel, was carried out with the help and guidance of advanced Soviet technology. This has greatly contributed to accelerating our country's industrialization and enhancing our strength in defending peace.
    The design work for various huge construction projects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company was carried out with the help of a large number of excellent Soviet experts and technicians, using advanced science and technology. The Soviet expert in charge of guiding this work, Khlebnikov, led a large number of designers to Anshan for in-depth investigations. Their preliminary design book alone consisted of one hundred and twenty huge volumes. Their design for the construction of Anshan applied the most advanced Soviet experience. The great picture of building Anshan that has been designed has completely changed the old face of semi-colonial industry, making Anshan a modern steel city armed with advanced technology. The old Anshan showed everywhere the Japanese imperialists' plunder of China: the buildings were not uniform, the transportation was chaotic, the production was unbalanced, and the output of iron was more than steel, and steel was more than steel products, which hindered further development of production everywhere. The Soviet experts' design, on the one hand, made full use of existing equipment, transformed it to maximize its effectiveness; on the other hand, added many new, automated equipment to bring Anshan to a modern level. For example, the existing ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling sections have undergone fundamental changes in the quantity and quality of production after technical and equipment upgrades. The output of the ironmaking furnace has doubled the historical record without increasing equipment. The Soviet experts' design for the Anshan construction project is the most advanced in technology and the most economical in economy. This enables our country to invest only the minimum amount of funds, but can produce a large amount of steel at a high level of production. After Anshan's overall design by the Soviet Union, the output of various products will increase several times compared with the highest historical record; due to the increase in labor productivity, the number of personnel will be reduced by 37%. Taking steelmaking as an example, labor productivity can be increased six times.
    Anshan started large-scale construction in April this year. The magnitude of the project and the complexity of the technology were unprecedented for our workers and technicians. Six months before the official construction, the Soviet Union sent a large number of civil engineering and mechanical installation experts to Anshan. They provided detailed plans for the construction work. With the help of Soviet experts, the basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company established six engineering companies, seven processing factories, and a mechanized supply station, successfully completing the preparations for large-scale mechanized construction. With the help of Soviet experts, Anshan has opened various technical training courses. Soviet experts personally gave lessons to the leading cadres, technicians, and workers on the construction site on various important technical issues in the construction, such as winter construction and mechanical installation, and taught the most advanced Soviet technology to everyone. Thanks to the great selfless and in-depth and specific assistance of Soviet experts, the large-scale construction of Anshan was able to proceed smoothly. As a result of the establishment of various processing factories and the implementation of mechanized construction under the guidance of Soviet experts, the construction time of civil engineering projects was shortened by an average of about 30%; and as a result of learning from advanced Soviet experience and carrying out winter construction, the operating time can be increased by three or four months a year, and the completion time of many projects can be greatly shortened. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the machine installation work implemented "pre-installation". This practice not only ensured the quality of installation, but also shortened the installation time by 30% to 50%. In the construction, because of the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, huge amounts of money were saved in terms of materials, tools, and labor. For example, regarding the use of steel, a suggestion from a Soviet expert saved us 400 billion yuan. Among the projects carried out in Anshan this year, many were technically very complex and difficult, such as girder replacement, centerline measurement, and the installation of many precision machines. Our technicians and workers did not know or understand these projects in the past, but with the help of Soviet experts, they not only learned and mastered them, but also can do them very well now.
    With the help of Soviet experts, hundreds of leading cadres, thousands of technicians, and tens of thousands of workers in the basic construction department of Anshan have gained preliminary experience in large-scale basic construction after nearly a year of hard work, which is even more valuable.

    苏联大力帮助我建设鞍山
    对加速我国工业化进程贡献巨大
    【本报讯】在我国东北鞍山的大规模建设中，苏联人民在各方面都给了我们伟大无私的援助。鞍山大规模建设，从设计、施工、机器制造和安装以及人员的技术训练，都是在苏联先进技术的帮助和指导下进行的。这对加速我国工业化的进程，增强保卫和平的力量贡献极大。
    鞍山钢铁公司各项巨大建设工程的设计工作，是由大批优秀的苏联专家和技术人员，运用先进科学技术来帮助进行的。负责指导这一工作的苏联专家赫列巴尼柯夫，曾率领大批设计人员来鞍山作了深入的调查。仅他们作出的初步设计书，即有一百二十巨册。他们对建设鞍山的设计，运用了苏联最先进的经验。已设计出的建设鞍山的伟大图景，完全改变了半殖民地工业的旧面貌，使鞍山成为一座用先进的技术武装起来的现代化的钢铁城市。旧的鞍山处处表现了日本帝国主义对中国的掠夺行为：各部分建筑不统一，交通运输混乱，生产不平衡，出产的铁多于钢，钢多于钢材，处处阻碍着生产的进一步发展。苏联专家的设计则是一方面充分利用现有设备，加以改造，使其发挥最大效能；一方面增加许多新型的、自动化的设备，使鞍山达到现代化的水平。如现有的炼铁、炼钢和轧钢部分，经过技术和设备上的改造之后，生产的数量和质量都发生了根本的变化。炼铁炉在不增加设备的情况下，产量较历史上最高纪录增加一倍。苏联专家对鞍山建设工程的设计，在技术上是最先进的，在经济上却是最节省的。这使我们国家只投入最低限度的资金，却能以高度的生产水平来生产大量的钢铁。鞍山经过苏联总体设计之后，各种产品与历史上最高纪录相比，都将增加数倍；由于提高了劳动生产率，人员则相对减少百分之三十七。以炼钢为例，劳动生产率可提高六倍。
    鞍山在今年四月开始了大规模的建设，其工程的浩大和技术的复杂，都是我国的工人和技术人员从未经历过的。在正式施工半年以前，苏联就派了大批土木建筑和机械安装专家来到鞍山。他们对施工工作提供了周详的计划。在苏联专家的帮助下，鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门成立了六个工程公司、七个加工工厂和一个机械化供应站，顺利地完成了大规模机械化施工的准备工作。在苏联专家的帮助下，鞍山曾开办了各种技术训练班。对施工中的各种重要技术问题，如冬季施工、机械安装等，苏联专家都亲自给工地的领导干部、技术人员和工人上课，把苏联最先进的技术传授给大家。由于苏联专家这样伟大无私地、深入具体地进行帮助，鞍山的大规模建设才得以顺利进行。土木建筑工程由于在苏联专家的指导下，设立了各种加工工厂和进行机械化施工的结果，施工时间平均缩短了百分之三十左右；而由于学习苏联先进经验，进行冬季施工的结果，一年可以增加三、四个月的作业时间，许多工程又可以大大缩短完工的期限。机器安装工作，在苏联专家的指导下，实行了“预安装”。这一作法不但保证了安装质量，同时也使安装时间缩短了百分之三十到五十。在施工中因为实行苏联专家的建议，在材料、工具和劳动力方面，节省了巨量的金钱。如关于钢材的使用，苏联专家的一项建议，即使我们节省了四千亿元。在鞍山今年所进行的工程中，有许多在技术上是十分复杂和困难的，如托梁换柱、测量中心线及许多精密机器的安装等，我们的技术人员和工人过去对这些工程不会，不懂，但在苏联专家的帮助下，现在不但学懂和学会了，而且能够作得很好。
    鞍山基本建设部门的几百个领导干部、几千个技术人员和数万工人，在苏联专家的帮助下，经过将近一年的艰苦努力，对大规模的基本建设已经取得了初步经验，这更是十分值得珍贵的。
