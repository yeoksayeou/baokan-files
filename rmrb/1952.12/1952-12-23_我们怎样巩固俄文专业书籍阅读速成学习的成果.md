How We Consolidate the Results of Our Intensive Study of Russian Specialized Books
Wu Youshou, Lecturer, Department of Radio Engineering, Tsinghua University

    There are eight teachers in our Radio Engineering Department teaching and research group at Tsinghua University. Three of them originally couldn't even recognize the Russian alphabet, and the others, although they had studied Russian in the past, couldn't even understand noun declensions, let alone read books. After participating in the intensive Russian specialized book reading course this summer, each of us memorized more than a thousand new words and mastered some necessary grammar, and initially possessed the ability to read Russian specialized books. This achievement greatly encouraged everyone's learning confidence and enthusiasm. However, because intensive learning is a blitz, the foundation is not very solid. How to review in time, increase vocabulary, and improve reading ability became the most important issue at that time.
    At that time, although the school had not yet started, the work of adjusting departments was quite heavy. We had to move, study teaching plans, and do many other things, which could easily squeeze out time for learning Russian. In response to this situation, the leadership decided to guarantee learning through regulations, stipulating that 8:00 to 10:00 every morning would be the time for learning Russian. This was indeed a great encouragement to everyone's high learning enthusiasm.
    But how exactly should we learn? After the "Three-Anti" campaign, through ideological criticism, teachers basically drew a clear line between the enemy and ourselves ideologically, and the political attitude of leaning to one side, requiring learning from the Soviet Union, was very high. At that time, due to the limitations of not understanding Russian, we could only sigh in the face of a dazzling array of Russian books and were unable to accept them; now that everyone has the initial ability to read, they are eager to read Russian books in their own field. But there are many problems: everyone's vocabulary is not large enough, sentence analysis is not skilled enough, and more importantly, there are no tutors. We felt that with our current level, without good organization, it would be difficult to achieve the purpose of improving reading ability and consolidating Russian learning results if everyone read their own professional books. After discussion and research, we decided to leverage collective strength and focus on learning a basic textbook, "Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering"; at the same time, we also absorbed the experience from intensive learning, and comrades with better Russian skills first identified the new words in each lesson, so that everyone could memorize them before reading the text. If we didn't understand a problem, we would bring it up for discussion or ask the teachers in the Russian group for advice. In this way, we persisted in studying for about 30 hours, and each person memorized another four or five hundred new words, and reading ability also improved significantly.
    After the start of school, everyone had to spend most of their time on teaching work, and Russian learning could only be one hour a day at most, and collective learning was no longer easy to achieve. We had to adopt a more flexible and decentralized learning method. But if there is no center, it is likely to become loose. At that time, the work of adjusting departments had basically been completed, and the new Tsinghua University reformed the teaching system based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and therefore urgently needed to absorb the advanced Soviet scientific theories to reform and enrich the teaching content. Just at this time, the Publishing Administration lent us a batch of Russian books, some of which were textbooks for radio engineering. This was really great news. After a heated discussion, everyone decided to work around the book "Fundamentals of Radio Engineering"—translating while learning. Everyone's Russian level was still very poor, and there was even less translation experience. In order to correct errors in the translation and to help and supervise each other, the eight of us, under the leadership of the teaching and research group, organized ourselves, formulated a translation progress and study plan, and stipulated an inspection system. This laid a good foundation for our work.
    Because our teaching work was very busy after the start of school, we often squeezed out the time for learning Russian unconsciously. Although some comrades could spare a certain amount of time for translation, they neglected the aspects of reviewing grammar and new words and improving their Russian level. However, because of the inspection system, the teaching and research group quickly discovered these problems. These problems were raised and discussed at regular discussion meetings, which made everyone further realize the importance of learning Russian well. At the same time, in light of the specific situation, the plan was revised and work was arranged appropriately to ensure one hour of study time every day. One comrade, who had originally put Russian aside after intensive study due to busy work and almost lost all the results of intensive study, has now picked up the vocabulary cards and books again and is catching up with everyone to move forward together.
    We also encountered many difficulties in the translation work. For example, the meaning of Russian single words is relatively flexible, and each single word has several slightly different but related explanations. During intensive study, we only memorized one of its meanings, so we sometimes encountered this situation: we recognized every single word in a sentence, but we couldn't connect the whole sentence and say the meaning of the whole sentence. At this time, we had to look up the dictionary and pick out a more suitable meaning from it. But sometimes, we couldn't find a proper explanation even after searching the dictionary, so we had to go to the comrades in the Russian group. Not having a comprehensive grasp of the meaning of each single word brought us a lot of difficulties. Some individual comrades even thought that since we had to look up the dictionary anyway, memorizing single words was meaningless. Of course, this idea is wrong. Experience has shown that the more new words you master, the more your reading ability will improve. In the process of translation, if you can thoroughly explore each single word and comprehensively memorize its meaning, it will be of greater help to improving reading ability. In order to achieve the purpose of increasing vocabulary, we recorded all the single words we encountered in the translation, and after sorting them out, we distributed them to each comrade. Because these single words are commonly used in the profession, everyone is very interested and willing to spend time memorizing them. Now everyone has memorized almost two thousand single words. Because the number of words remembered has increased, reading ability has improved significantly. At the beginning, the average reading speed was only about one page per hour, but now it has increased to four or five pages.
    Among our eight people, in addition to two professors, the other six are young lecturers and teaching assistants. Their Russian level is poor, their professional level is also poor, and there is even less translation experience. When we started translating, the sentences we translated were always long and rambling, and they didn't sound like Chinese. Some comrades only sought speed and didn't finish reading the whole sentence before starting to translate. Sometimes, after finishing the translation and reading it themselves, they didn't know what it meant. However, Professor Meng Zhaoying translated very well, and everyone asked him to talk about his experience at the discussion meeting. His experience was very helpful to everyone, correcting the bias of individual comrades who only sought speed and did not delve into it.
    In order to ensure the quality of the translation, we periodically proofread each other's translated manuscripts. When proofreading, everyone is very serious, checking word by word and sentence by sentence. If there are any problems, we raise them for discussion, which has played a great role in improving our analytical ability. For example, the Chinese explanation of the Russian word "до" is "到" (dao), meaning "to arrive," and "до" and "到" sound similar. Everyone thought that this word was easy to remember, but they didn't expect that its meaning in Russian sometimes must be explained as "不到" (bu dao), meaning "not arriving," to be correct. One comrade carelessly reversed the meaning of the original text when translating, but because there was a proofreading system, the problem was finally discovered and corrected.
    As time goes by, the vocabulary we master is slowly increasing, and our reading ability is gradually improving. The products of our translation are also increasing day by day; nearly 600 pages of "Fundamentals of Radio Engineering" have been translated for nearly four hundred pages. When we see piles of lecture notes in front of us and hear that these lecture notes have played a certain role in students' learning, how excited we are! We know that this is only a very small harvest, and we must work hard to persist in learning. Now we have formulated further plans to strive to finish translating this book by February next year; at the same time, we must memorize another nine hundred new words and review basic grammar to further improve our Russian level.

    我们怎样巩固俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习的成果
    清华大学无线电系讲师  吴佑寿
    我们清华大学无线电系教研组的教师，一共八个人。其中有三个人原来连俄文字母都认不全，另外几个人，虽说过去也学过俄文，但是别说看书，就连名词变格也还搞不太清楚。今年暑假，我们参加俄文专业书籍速成阅读学习之后，每个人都记住了一千多个生字，掌握了一些必须的文法，初步具有了阅读俄文专业书籍的能力。这个收获大大地鼓舞了每个人的学习信心和情绪。可是由于速成学习是突击性的，因而基础也是不很巩固的。如何及时复习，增识字汇，提高阅读能力，就成为当时最重要的问题。
    那个时候，学校虽还没有开学，可是院系调整工作是够繁重的。我们要搬家，要研究教学计划，要做很多很多其他的工作，很容易把学习俄文的时间挤掉。针对这种情况，领导方面决心从制度上来保证学习，规定每天早上八时至十时为学习俄文的时间。这对大家高涨的学习情绪的确又是一个很大的鼓舞。
    可是究竟怎样来进行学习呢？“三反”以后，经过了思想批判，教师们在思想上基本上划清了敌我界限，政治上肯定要一边倒，要求向苏联学习的情绪非常高。当时因受不懂俄文的限制，面对着琳琅满目的俄文书籍，只好望洋兴叹，无法接受；现在大家具有了初步的阅读能力，就迫切地要求阅读本行的俄文书籍了。可是问题很多：大家所掌握的字汇还不够多，句法分析还不够熟练，更重要的是没有辅导员。我们感觉到按我们目前的水平，如果没有很好的组织，各人看各人的专业书，是难以达到提高阅读能力、巩固俄文学习成果的目的的。经过了大家的讨论研究，决定发挥集体力量，集中学习
    一本基础课本“电工基础”；同时又吸收速成学习中的经验，由俄文较好的同志先把各课中的生字查出来，让大家把它熟记之后，再进行课文的阅读。不懂的问题，就拿出来讨论，或者请教俄文组的教师。就这样，我们又坚持了三十小时左右的学习，每个人又记住了四五百个生字，阅读能力也显著地提高了。
    开学以后，大家主要的时间都要放在教学工作上，俄文学习每天最多只能有一个小时了，集体学习也已不易做到。必须采用较灵活的分散的学习方式。可是如果漫无中心，又很可能流于松散。那个时候，院系调整工作已经基本完成，新的清华大学根据苏联的先进经验，改革了教学制度，因而更迫切地需要吸收苏联先进的科学理论来改革和充实教学内容。恰好这时出版总署借给我们一批俄文书籍，其中有一些是无线电专业的课本。这真是一个绝好的消息。经过大家的热烈讨论，决定围绕着“无线电基础”这本书来进行工作——一边翻译，一边学习。大家的俄文水平还很差，翻译经验更少，为了纠正译文中的错误，更为了能够互相帮助督促，我们八个人，在教研组的领导下，组织起来，拟订了翻译进度和学习计划，并规定了检查制度。这给我们的工作打下了一个良好的基础。
    因为开学以后，我们的教学工作很忙，往往在不知不觉之中，就把学俄文的时间挤掉，有的同志虽也能抽出一定的时间来进行翻译，可是对于复习文法和生字、提高俄文水平这一方面就忽视了。但是因为有了检查制度，教研组很快就发现了这些问题。在定期的讨论会上，把这些问题提了出来，作了讨论，使大家进一步认识了学好俄文的重要性，同时结合具体情况，修订计划，适当地安排工作，保证了每天一小时的学习时间。有一个同志，本来因为工作忙，在突击学习以后，一直就把俄文放在一边，几乎把突击学习中的成果都丢生了。但是现在，他又拿起了生字卡片和书本，赶上大家，一起前进了。
    在翻译工作上，我们所碰到的困难也很不少。例如俄文单字的意义比较灵活，每一个单字都有着几种不太相同但又彼此有关的解释。突击学习的时候，我们只记住它的某一意义，所以有时便会遇到这种情况：句子中每个单字都认识，却无法把全句贯穿起来，说出整句的意思。这时只好查字典，从里面挑出较合适的意义。但有时翻遍了字典，也找不出恰当的解释，只好去找俄文组的同志们。对每个单字意义掌握的不全面，给我们带来了不少困难，个别的同志甚至因此认为反正还得查字典，背单字没有什么意义。当然，这种想法是错误的。经验证明，生字掌握得多，阅读能力是会大大地提高的。在翻译过程中，如果对每个单字都能够深入地探讨，全面地熟记它的意义，那对阅读能力的提高，会有更大的帮助。为了达到增识字汇的目的，我们把翻译中所碰到的单字都记下来，经过整理，分给每个同志。因为这些单字都是专业上常用的，大家都很有兴趣，愿意花时间去背记。现在每个人差不多都已记住二千个单字。由于记得的字汇增多了，阅读能力显著提高，开始时平均阅读速度只是每小时一页左右，现在已经增加到四五页了。
    在我们八个人中，除了两位教授之外，另外六个人都是年轻的讲师和助教。俄文水平差，业务水平也差，更谈不到翻译经验。开始翻译时，译出来的句子，总是长拉拉的一大串，念起来不太像中国话。有的同志只求快，整句话没有看完，就下笔翻译，有时译完之后自己看一遍，也不知道是什么意思。可是孟昭英教授却译得很好，在讨论会上大家请他谈了谈经验。他的经验对大家很有帮助，纠正了个别同志只求速度不深入钻研的偏向。
    为了保证译文的质量，我们把每人所翻译的稿子，定期互相校对。校对的时候，大家都很认真，逐字逐句地检查，有了问题就提出来讨论，这对分析能力的提高起了很大的作用。例如俄文“до”字，中文解释是“到”的意思，“до”和“到”谐音，大家都认为这个字很好记，没有料想到它在俄文中的意思有时必须用“不到”来解释才正确。有一个同志在翻译时不当心，把原文的意思恰好弄反了，因为有了校对制度，终于发现了这问题，改正过来了。
    随着时间的前进，我们所掌握的字汇慢慢在增多，阅读能力也逐步在提高，我们翻译的产品，也一天天地增加；将近六百页的“无线电基础”，已经译完了四百来页。当我们看到面前摆着一叠叠的讲义，听到这些讲义对同学的学习已经起了一定的作用的时候，我们是多么兴奋！我们知道这只是很小的收获，还必须努力坚持学习。现在我们又订出了进一步的计划，争取在明年二月间把这本书译完；同时还要再背九百个生字，复习基本文法，使俄文水平更加提高。
