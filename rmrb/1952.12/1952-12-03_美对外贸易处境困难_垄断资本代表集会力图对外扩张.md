    US Foreign Trade in Difficult Straits
    Monopoly Capital Representatives Gather to Expand Outward
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch from New York, 24th] According to TASS, more than two thousand representatives of major bourgeois groups in the United States held a so-called "National Foreign Trade Convention" in New York last week to discuss international trade and overseas investment issues. The conference was convened by the "National Foreign Trade Council," whose board of directors includes representatives from many banks, large corporations, and export companies. The council is controlled by the Rockefeller, Morgan, DuPont, and Mellon groups, as well as businesses owned by capitalists outside of these large monopoly capital groups.
    The conference particularly focused on the following issues: the shrinking of the world market and the increasing competition the United States is encountering in world trade from other capitalist countries; the desire of other capitalist countries to break the shackles imposed by the United States on their trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies; the rising tide of national liberation movements around the world, especially in South American countries; the determination to break down so-called trade "barriers" that hinder the United States from seizing more foreign markets; and the utilization of political and economic measures to enable Wall Street to control more foreign raw material resources and expand the scope of Wall Street's overseas investment.
    At one of the conference sessions, John Kinsey, export manager of a Detroit company, pointed out that West Germany's competition is becoming increasingly fierce in the field of machine tools. Kinsey said, "American machine tool manufacturers used to export 20 percent of their total production, but at present, they can only export 6 percent, and this ratio is still declining."
    An essay published in the "Wall Street Journal" on November 20th stated that the capitalists attending the conference were more pessimistic about the future of foreign trade in private conversations than in public meetings.
    The question of how American capital can further penetrate foreign countries—particularly investment for the purpose of developing raw material resources—occupied an important place in the conference's discussions. Kempe, Vice President of International Harvester Company, frankly stated that the purpose of investing overseas is to bring maximum profits to American capitalists. Kempe said, "The main objective of all private commercial investment is to make money." Kempe demanded a "favorable investment environment."
    Michaeler, a senior official of Standard Oil of New Jersey, provided a clearer explanation of what conditions constitute a "favorable investment environment." He said that he believes that only in those countries with regimes that completely obey Wall Street's orders and are themselves willing not to develop national industries will there be a "favorable environment" for American investment.
    Michaeler and other speakers unanimously suggested that the United States should use pressure, including stopping loans to Latin American governments, in order to force Latin American countries to establish an environment conducive to Wall Street investment.
    At the conference, Aldrich, Chairman of Chase Bank, made the aggressive nature of American financial capitalism even clearer in his final speech. Aldrich called for a "strong" and "courageous" economic policy to supplement a new long-term foreign policy, a foreign policy that "never underestimates the necessity of the abundant military strength of ourselves and our allies." However, Aldrich admitted that the American economic system "cannot indefinitely sustain an endless arms race and the continuous ‘giving of aid to our allies.’" Aldrich also admitted that "many of our allies are already in economic difficulties." He said that they are currently unable to find markets for their products.

    美对外贸易处境困难
    垄断资本代表集会力图对外扩张
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：美国的主要资产阶级集团的二千多名代表上星期在纽约举行所谓“全国对外贸易大会”，讨论国际贸易和海外投资问题。这个大会是由“全国对外贸易委员会”召集的，这个委员会的理事会包括很多银行界、大企业公司和出口公司等的代表。这个委员会是由洛克菲勒、摩根、杜邦和梅隆集团以及这些大垄断资本集团范围以外的资本家的企业所控制的。
    大会特别着重讨论下列问题：世界市场的缩小和美国在世界贸易中所遭遇到的其他资本主义国家不断增加的竞争；其他资本主义国家想打破美国对它们与苏联及人民民主国家的贸易关系所加的束缚；全世界高涨的民族解放运动、特别是南美各国的民族运动；打破阻碍美国攫取更多国外市场的所谓贸易“壁垒”的决心；利用政治和经济措施，使华尔街得以控制更多的外国原料资源和扩大华尔街海外投资范围。
    在大会的一次会议上，底特律某公司出口部经理约翰·金塞指出：在工作母机方面，西德的竞争愈来愈剧烈了。金塞说：“美国工作母机制造商一向输出他们全部生产的百分之二十，但在目前，他们只能输出百分之六，而且这个比率还在减退着。”
    十一月二十日的“华尔街日报”刊载的一篇论文说：出席这次大会的资本家们在私下交谈中，对于国外贸易前途，比在公开会议上还要悲观。
    美国资本如何进一步渗入外国的问题——特别是为了开发原料资源的投资——在这个大会的讨论中占了重要地位。万国农具公司副总经理开姆普坦白地说：向海外投资，其目的是要为美国资本家带来最大限度的利润。开姆普说：“所有私人商业投资的主要目的就是要赚钱。”开姆普要求一个“有利的投资环境”。
    新泽西美孚油公司的一位高级职员密歇勒尔对什么条件才能构成“有利的投资环境”作了更明确的解释。他说，他认为：只有在那些具备着完全听从华尔街的命令，而且它们自己愿意不发展民族工业的政权的国家里，才会有对美国投资“有利的环境”。
    密歇勒尔和其他发言人一致建议：美国应该使用压力，包括停止给拉丁美洲各国的政府贷款，以便迫使拉丁美洲各国建立有利于华尔街投资的环境。
    在大会上最后发言的大通银行董事长阿德利治更加清楚地说明了美国金融资本主义的侵略性质。阿德利治要求实行一种“强有力的”和“勇敢的”经济政策，以便补充新的长期外交政策，这个外交政策“决不低估我们自己的和我们盟国的充沛军力的必要性”。但是，阿德利治承认：美国的经济制度“不能够无限期地维持无止境的扩军竞赛和继续不断地‘给予我们盟国援助’”。阿德利治同时承认：“我们的盟国中有许多已陷入经济困难之中。”他说，目前它们都不能为它们的生产品找到市场。
