    People's Fine Arts Publishing House has Published Over Six Million New Year Pictures
    To welcome the New Year and Spring Festival of 1953, the National Association of Fine Arts Workers and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House jointly organized the creation and publication of New Year pictures. More than 40 kinds of New Year pictures were published this year, including 26 reprinted versions, all of which were excellent works from this year's New Year picture awards, with over six million copies printed. Among the 15 newly created New Year pictures this year are Deng Shu's "Harvest," Hou Yimin's "Workers Become Mine Managers," Hei Lang's "Lysenko Helps Farmers Improve Cotton Planting Techniques," Saiqin Laxi's (Inner Mongolia painter) "Patriotic Production Increase Movement on the Grasslands," and Wang Shuhui's "Tibetan People Welcome the People's Liberation Army." These New Year pictures mostly use national forms loved by the people, express meaningful themes, and successfully portray the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the new China. In the creative process, the painters mostly adopted a serious creative attitude, went deep into real life to draw materials, and took out their works to observe each other, repeatedly revised them, and then finalized them.

    人民美术出版社已出版新年画六百多万张
    为迎接一九五三年新年和春节，全国美术工作者协会和人民美术出版社共同组织了新年画的创作及出版工作。本年度出版的新年画共四十多种，其中再版的有二十六种，都是今年年画评奖中的优秀作品，现已印制六百多万张。今年新创作的十五种年画中，有邓澍的“丰收”，侯逸民的“工人当了矿长”，黑浪的“卢森科帮助农民改进植棉技术”，晒亲拉西（内蒙画家）的“草原上的爱国增产运动”，王叔晖的“西藏人民欢迎人民解放军”等。这些年画大多是运用为人民大众所喜爱的民族形式，表现了富有意义的主题，并比较成功地刻划出新中国工、农、兵的形象。在创作过程中，画家们多能采取严肃的创作态度，深入到实际生活中去汲取题材，并把作品拿出来互相观摩，反复修改，然后定稿。
