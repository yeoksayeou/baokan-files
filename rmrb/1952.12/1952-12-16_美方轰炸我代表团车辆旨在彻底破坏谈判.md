Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 15th. While clamoring for new military adventures, the U.S. side has also resorted to the shameless tactic of creating provocative incidents. At 11:30 AM on December 13th, U.S. military aircraft bombed vehicles of our delegation traveling from Kaesong to Pyongyang, north of Sariwon, wounding Park Cheol-soo, our security officer stationed at the Panmunjom meeting area, and his young child, as well as five other staff members of our delegation. Park Cheol-soo's injuries are serious. This is another serious act of sabotage against the agreement by the U.S. side since the suspension of the armistice negotiations.

This provocative incident was clearly premeditated by the U.S. side. The incident occurred during the day, and the weather was good that day. Our delegation's vehicles were clearly marked according to the agreement between the two sides and were easily identifiable. It is particularly noteworthy that this incident occurred after Eisenhower's visit to Korea to carry out conspiratorial activities, and at a time when American generals are clamoring to continue and expand the Korean War. Everyone still remembers that in the past year and this year, whenever the armistice negotiations were deadlocked due to the unreasonable demands of the U.S. side, the U.S. side created such incidents of bombing and strafing our delegation's vehicles, in order to sabotage the negotiations. In this year alone, the U.S. side has created four such incidents, killing and wounding as many as seventeen members of our delegation. The purpose of this new provocative incident by the U.S. side is clearly to completely sabotage the negotiations in order to expand the war without restraint.

Since the U.S. side systematically interrupted the negotiations, the U.S. side has violated the meeting area seven times with aircraft, shelled the meeting area twice, distributed insulting leaflets in the meeting area, bombed our POW camps with clear markings, and massacred their own captured personnel. This series of violations of the agreement by the U.S. side should arouse serious attention from the whole world.

### 美方轰炸我代表团车辆旨在彻底破坏谈判

    美方轰炸我代表团车辆旨在彻底破坏谈判
    【新华社开城十五日电】美方在叫嚣要进行新的军事冒险的同时，又施展了制造挑衅事件的无耻手段。本月十三日上午十一时三十分，美方军用飞机又在沙里院以北轰炸从开城驶往平壤的我方代表团车辆，炸伤我方驻板门店会场区安全军官朴哲洙和他的幼儿，以及我方代表团其他工作人员共五人。其中朴哲洙的伤势严重。这是美方在中断停战谈判以来的又一次严重破坏协议的行为。
    这一挑衅事件显然是美方蓄意进行的。这一事件发生在白天，当天天气很好，我方代表团车辆根据双方协议设有明显标志，极易辨别。特别值得注意的，是这一事件发生在艾森豪威尔来朝鲜进行阴谋活动以后，发生在美国将军们叫嚣继续和扩大朝鲜战争的时候。大家都还记得，在去年和今年，每当停战谈判因为美方的无理要求而陷于僵局的时候，美方就制造这种轰炸、扫射我方代表团车辆的事件，借以破坏谈判。仅仅在今年，美方已经先后制造了四次这样的事件，打死打伤我方代表团工作人员达十七人之多。美方这一新的挑衅事件，其目的显然是要彻底破坏谈判，以便放手扩大战争。
    自从美方有计划地中断谈判以来，美方曾七次以飞机侵越会场区，两次炮击会场区，在会场区散发侮辱性传单，轰炸设有明显标志的我方战俘营，屠杀他们自己的被俘人员。美方这一系列违反协议事件应该引起全世界严重注意。
