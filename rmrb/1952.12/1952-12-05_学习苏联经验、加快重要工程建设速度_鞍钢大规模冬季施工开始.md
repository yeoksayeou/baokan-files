Learning from Soviet Experience, Accelerating the Speed of Key Engineering Construction
Anshan Iron and Steel Launches Large-Scale Winter Construction

[This newspaper report] Anshan Iron and Steel Company's infrastructure construction projects, thanks to learning from advanced Soviet experience and overcoming the natural obstacle of the cold climate, has smoothly launched a large-scale winter construction program.

The winter temperature in Anshan is below minus 20 degrees Celsius. In the past, every year from mid-November to mid-April of the following year, all civil engineering and construction activities had to be stopped. Therefore, only two-thirds of the year could be used for civil engineering and construction. Usually, the civil engineering workload of heavy industrial factory construction projects accounts for 40% to 50% of the total workload. If winter construction cannot be carried out, the speed of the entire construction project will be delayed. In the past, China had never implemented winter construction. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the Japanese experimented in Anshan, but even though coke ovens were provided, the equipment foundations were still damaged by freezing, and they had to spend more than half a year re-blasting these damaged foundations.

In order to accelerate the progress of Anshan Iron and Steel's large-scale infrastructure construction, last year, Soviet expert Vitchtomov promptly suggested that the 101 and 102 key projects should implement winter construction. At that time, some technically conservative personnel had concerns, believing that this was "risky." However, the leadership supported the expert's opinion, and last winter, the first experiment of winter construction was carried out in the Dongshan Apartments. Under the guidance of Soviet expert Vitchtomov, training classes were opened to cultivate a large number of talents who could master winter construction techniques, creating extremely favorable conditions for this year's 101 and 102 key projects' winter construction.

As early as last year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company made further preparations for winter construction. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, a cement mixing plant with complete heating and insulation equipment for sand, water, and concrete was pre-built. At the same time, a complete set of scientific testing equipment was established to check the quality of winter projects at any time. At the beginning of this year's winter construction, all transportation vehicles, such as dump trucks and universal loaders, were covered with cotton padding. The outer perimeter of the engineering foundations where concrete was to be poured in winter was also surrounded by straw mat sheds, and heating pipes were installed inside the sheds to ensure that the temperature was maintained at around 15 to 20 degrees Celsius.

(This method is called the warm shed method of winter construction. The Soviet Union has four methods of winter construction: warm shed method, heat storage method, electric heating method, and steam heating method.)

In early November of this year, cold waves repeatedly hit Anshan, and the evening temperature suddenly dropped to minus eight or nine degrees, but because preparations for winter construction had been made and workers had learned winter construction techniques, the cold waves could no longer hinder the progress of the project. From November 16th, the No. 11 foundation of the 101 project smoothly entered the winter construction phase. The concrete volume of this foundation is more than 3,000 cubic meters, which is more than the amount of concrete used to build a four-story building of 10,000 square meters. The total amount of concrete that needs to be poured in winter is tens of thousands of cubic meters. This is an unprecedented feat in the history of Chinese architecture. Thanks to the outstanding achievements of Soviet science and technology and the guidance of Soviet experts, the success of this huge project is fully assured.

Although winter construction will increase some engineering costs, with heating and insulation equipment accounting for about 15% of the project cost, these two key projects can be completed several months ahead of schedule as a result. Anshan Iron and Steel's large-scale winter construction is a sign of changing the seasonality of China's construction industry. It can not only provide experience for large-scale infrastructure construction nationwide, but also accelerate the progress of heavy industrial construction projects like Anshan, which is of great significance to China's economic construction.

### 学习苏联经验、加快重要工程建设速度  鞍钢大规模冬季施工开始

    学习苏联经验、加快重要工程建设速度
    鞍钢大规模冬季施工开始
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司基本建设工程，由于学习苏联先进经验，战胜了气候寒冷的自然障碍，已顺利地进行大规模的冬季施工。
    鞍山冬季的气温在摄氏零下二十度以下，从前每年从十一月中旬到第二年四月中旬，一切土木建筑活动都要停止。因此，一年中只有三分之二的时间能够进行土木建筑工程的施工。通常重工业工厂建设工程的土木建筑工作量要占总工作量的百分之四十到五十，如果不能在冬季施工，整个建设工程的速度都会延缓。中国过去从来没有实行过冬季施工。伪满时日本人曾在鞍山试验过，虽然生了焦炉，设备基础仍然冻坏了，不得不又耗费半年多的时间重新爆破这些做坏了的基础。
    为了加速鞍钢大规模基本建设的进程，去年，苏联专家维契托莫夫及时提出建议，一零一、一零二两大工程应该实行冬季施工。当时某些有保守思想的技术人员曾有顾虑，认为这是“冒险”。但是，领导方面支持了专家的意见，去年冬天就在东山公寓进行了冬季施工的首次实验，并在苏联专家维契托莫夫的指导下，开办了训练班，培养了大批能够掌握冬季施工技术的人材，为今年一零一、一零二两大工程冬季施工创造了极为有利的条件。
    早在去年，鞍山钢铁公司就为冬季施工做了进一步的准备工作。在苏联专家指导下，一座有全套沙子、水和混凝土的加热、保温装置的洋灰搅拌厂预先建筑了起来，同时并建立了一整套科学检验设备，用来随时检查冬季工程的质量。今年冬季施工开始时，所有的运输工具，如翻斗汽车、万能装卸车等都已穿上了棉衣；准备在冬季浇灌混凝土的工程基础的外围，也用草席暖棚围了起来，棚里配置了暖气管，保证温度维持在摄氏十五度到二十度左右。
    （这种方法叫做暖棚法冬季施工。苏联有四种冬季施工法，即暖棚法、蓄热法、电气加热法、蒸气加热法。）
    今年十一月初，寒流几次侵袭鞍山，晚上的气温突然降到零下八、九度，但由于做好了冬季施工的准备和职工们学会了冬季施工的技术，寒流已不能阻碍工程的进行。从十一月十六日起，一零一工程的十一号基础就顺利地进入冬季施工的阶段。这个基础的混凝土量共达三千余立方公尺，比建造一座一万平方公尺的四层楼大厦所用的混凝土还要多，总计在冬季需要灌浇的混凝土就有数万立方公尺。这是中国建筑史上一件空前的壮举。由于苏联科学技术的卓越成就和苏联专家的指导，这一巨大工程的成功就有了完全的把握。
    冬季施工虽然要提高一些工程成本，其中取暖保温设备约占工程费的百分之十五左右，但是这两大工程因此可提前数月完工。鞍钢基本建设工程大规模冬季施工，是改变我国建筑工业季节性的标志，不仅可为全国范围大规模的基本建设提供经验，而且加速像鞍山这一重工业建设工程的进程，对我国的经济建设事业有着极大的意义。（附图片）
