Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 10th. The Korean Cabinet's Ministry of Culture and Propaganda held a press conference in Pyongyang on the 8th to introduce the defected former Rhee Seung-man puppet army Second Lieutenant pilot, Guk Yeong-am. Guk Yeong-am was a first-term student of the Gwangju Rhee Seung-man puppet army basic flight training class, and was scheduled to graduate on December 20th. At the press conference, he said that he had long been dissatisfied with the dark and corrupt rule of the American and Rhee reactionaries in South Korea, and now Eisenhower wanted to drive more South Koreans to serve as cannon fodder, so he decided to defect.

Guk Yeong-am talked about the demoralized state of the Rhee puppet army, saying: The poor living conditions of the Rhee puppet army, the system of officers beating and scolding soldiers, the racial discrimination and insults of the American troops against the Rhee puppet army, especially seeing that the armistice negotiations were being obstructed by the Americans, the war-weariness among the Rhee puppet army soldiers was increasing day by day, and escapes and suicides often occurred. Since Eisenhower proposed to drive more Koreans to serve as cannon fodder, the Rhee puppet army officers and soldiers were even more panicked, and many wanted to escape.

Guk Yeong-am pointed out that under the brutal rule of the American and Rhee bandit gangs, the lives of the South Korean people were even more painful. American soldiers committed rape, robbery, and insults against the people, doing everything possible. Due to soaring prices, people's lives were extremely difficult. Many female students in Seoul were forced to work as dance hall girls at night, and many women were reduced to prostitutes. In order to escape conscription and resist the brutal rule of the American and Rhee reactionaries, South Korean youths constantly fled to the mountains to join the guerrillas.

Guk Yeong-am said: In South Korea, I heard American propaganda saying that their planes were bombing only military targets in North Korea, but after I arrived in North Korea, I saw that they were wantonly bombing peaceful cities and villages that had nothing to do with military targets. He also said: After I arrived in North Korea, I was surprised to see the farmers' bumper harvests, because what I heard in South Korea was that the North Korean people were in a state of starvation. Guk Yeong-am expressed the hope that his colleagues and friends in the Rhee puppet army would no longer be deceived by such propaganda and would quickly wake up.

    起义李伪军空军驾驶员
    揭露美李匪帮的暴虐统治
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜内阁文化宣传省于八日在平壤市举行记者招待会，介绍起义的前李承晚伪军少尉驾驶员鞠永岩。鞠永岩是光州李承晚伪陆军基本飞行训练班一期生，即将在十二月二十日毕业。他在记者招待会上说，他早就不满美李反动派在南朝鲜的黑暗腐败统治，现在艾森豪威尔又要驱使更多的南朝鲜人当炮灰，因此就决定起义。
    鞠永岩谈到李伪军士气沮丧的情形说：李伪军生活待遇的恶劣、军官对士兵的打骂制度、美军对李伪军的种族歧视与侮辱，特别是看到停战谈判受到美国人的阻挠，李伪军士兵中的厌战情绪正一天比一天增涨，常常发生逃跑和自戕的事情。自从艾森豪威尔提出要驱使更多的朝鲜人当炮灰后，李伪军官兵更加恐慌，很多人都想逃跑。
    鞠永岩指出：在美李匪帮的暴虐统治下，南朝鲜人民的生活更加痛苦。美军强奸妇女、抢劫、侮辱人民，无所不为。由于物价飞涨，人民生活极端困苦。汉城的很多女学生被迫在晚间当舞女，许多妇女沦为娼妓。南朝鲜的青年为了逃避抓兵，反抗美李反动派的暴虐统治，不断逃往山区，参加游击队。
    鞠永岩说：在南朝鲜听美国人宣传说他们的飞机到北朝鲜轰炸的都是军事目标，但是我到北朝鲜以后看到他们狂轰滥炸的是与军事目标完全没有关系的和平城市与农村。他又说：我到了北朝鲜以后，看到农民丰收的情况，很感意外，因为我在南朝鲜听到的是北朝鲜人民正处于饥饿状态。鞠永岩表示，希望他在李伪军中的同事们和他的朋友们，不要再受那种宣传的欺骗，赶快觉悟起来。
