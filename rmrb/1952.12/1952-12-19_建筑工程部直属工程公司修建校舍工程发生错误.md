    Errors Occur in School Building Project Undertaken by Construction Engineering Department Directly Subordinate Engineering Company

    To the Editor: The Construction Engineering Department Directly Subordinate Engineering Company, in its construction of the school buildings for the Beijing Transportation Cadre School, did not conduct a preliminary survey and proceeded blindly with construction, resulting in numerous problems with the completed project.

    The errors in this project are numerous. First, the school's buildings were constructed on a layer of sand. Now, the foundation has sunk, cracks have appeared in the classroom ceilings, and cracks have also appeared in the northeast corner of the dormitory, posing a risk of collapse.

    Second, there was cutting of corners and shoddy workmanship, resulting in extremely low project quality: the dining hall's plaster ceiling is sagging; all the window panes are cracked; the school gate broke within ten days of being newly installed; the classroom doors cannot be opened or closed; the cement floors are now exposing sand, and when swept, dust and sand fly everywhere, obscuring vision.

    Third, the school building project was completed in early August, but the construction materials are still piled up at the school, left to rot. Even more regrettable is that seven tons of lime have been left in a pool and never transported away. Now, the workers at the construction site have actually buried the lime pit with earth.

    The school has raised these issues with the responsible comrades at the construction site multiple times, but they have ignored them.

    I hope that the leaders of the Construction Engineering Department Directly Subordinate Engineering Company and the responsible persons of Construction Site 407 will conduct a thorough self-criticism.

### 建筑工程部直属工程公司修建校舍工程发生错误

    建筑工程部直属工程公司修建校舍工程发生错误
    编辑同志：中央建筑工程部直属工程公司修建北京交通干部学校的校舍工程中，事前不勘测，盲目施工，完工后的工程，发生了很多毛病。
    这项工程的错误很多，首先是把该校的楼房建筑在沙层上。现在地基已经下沉，教室的屋顶发生裂缝，宿舍的东北角也发生裂缝，有倒塌的危险。
    其次是偷工减料，粗制滥造，因而工程质量极低：食堂灰顶下垂；门窗玻璃一律裂缝；校门新装不到十天就坏了；教室的门不能开关；洋灰地现已露出砂子，一打扫，尘沙飞扬，迷人眼目。
    再次，在八月初该校校舍工程就完成了，而工地的材料到现在仍然堆积在该校，任其腐朽。更可惜的是有七吨石灰放在池子里一直不运走，现在工地的工人竟用土把石灰池给埋葬了。
    对上述问题该校曾向该工地负责同志多次提出意见，但他们也置之不理。
    我希望中央建筑工程部直属工程公司的领导同志和四○七工地的负责人作深刻检讨。    李毓振
