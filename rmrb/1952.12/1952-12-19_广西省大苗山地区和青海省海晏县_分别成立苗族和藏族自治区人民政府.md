    The first session's second meeting of representatives from all ethnic groups and all sectors of the people in the Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region of Yishan Special District, Guangxi Province, was held in Rongshui Town (the old Rong County town) from November 18th to 26th. The meeting exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, elected the county head and members of the People's Government, and officially established the Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region People's Government.
    The Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region was originally part of Rong County, Sanjiang, and Luocheng counties. It is home to seven ethnic groups including Miao, Han, Zhuang, Dong, Yao, Shui, and Gaoshan, with the Miao people being the majority in the area. The total population is more than 160,000, with nearly 70,000 Miao people. In July of this year, the Guangxi Provincial Ethnic Work Conference accepted the requests of the people of all ethnic groups in Damao Mountain and decided to establish an autonomous region, and formed a working committee, dispatching working teams to various districts to carry out work. Over the past three months, the region has established ten district and one hundred and thirty-five township-level ethnic democratic governments, further strengthening ethnic unity and greatly enhancing the political awareness of the people of all ethnic minorities in Damao Mountain. A total of two hundred and eighty-five representatives of all ethnic groups attended the meeting. With a cautious and responsible attitude, they elected Yang Wengui (Miao nationality) as the county head, and Ma Zhendong and twenty-eight others as members. The representatives were very satisfied with the election conducted on the basis of democracy and unity. They happily sang: "The bamboo in front of the door blooms with fine flowers, the minority nationalities are in charge, elect Wengui as the county head, and there is a way to build the Miao Mountain."
    The meeting adopted the Provisional Organizational Regulations and Policy Guidelines of the Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region People's Government, the Damao Mountain Unity Pact, and also discussed the People's Government's grain requisition methods and plans. The representatives expressed with confidence that they would do a good job in propaganda, take the lead in paying public grain, and complete the grain requisition task.
    The good news of the establishment of the Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region People's Government spread to both sides of the Beijiang River, and the people of all ethnic groups were overjoyed, rushing from all directions to the capital of the Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region—Rongshui Town—to celebrate; some Miao and Dong elders in their sixties and seventies also rushed from more than a hundred miles away. The people of all ethnic groups happily danced ethnic dances and sang in their own languages: "The people of all ethnic groups are of one heart, forever following Chairman Mao."

    The Haiyan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government in Qinghai Province was officially established on November 11th. The autonomous region is located on the eastern side of Qinghai Province. There are five ethnic groups in the region, including Tibetan, Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Tu, with a total of ten thousand five hundred and seventy-two people, of which the Tibetan people account for thirty-six percent. Except for a small portion of agricultural areas, most of the region is a pastoral area where Tibetan and Mongolian people live. Over the past three years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, ethnic unity in the region has been increasingly strengthened, and local order has been stabilized. Due to the People's Government's promotion of rotational grazing, organization of sideline production, and issuance of livestock loans, livestock production has been restored and developed; the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been improved, coupled with the gradual improvement of the awareness of the people of all ethnic groups, creating conditions for the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy.
    The Haiyan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Haiyan County People's Government, in order to implement the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program, widely consulted with people of all ethnic groups half a year ago, and formed a preparatory committee for regional autonomy including representatives of all ethnic groups. In early October, the county also sent five working groups to go deep into the yurts in the pastoral areas to repeatedly publicize documents such as the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China". After hearing the publicity of the regional autonomy policy, the people of all ethnic groups had a further understanding of the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy.
    From November 2nd to 5th, when the Haiyan County held the first third session of the representatives of the people of all ethnic groups, according to Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," the Haiyan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government was formally established. The meeting also formulated the autonomous region's livestock production increase plan for 1953 and the plan for training ethnic minority cadres on the basis of ethnic unity. The meeting also decided to establish a Mongolian Autonomous Region People's Government equivalent to the district level in the areas where Mongolian people live.
    On November 15th, the Autonomous Region People's Government Chairman Tong Quhe (Tibetan chieftain, formerly the head of the Haiyan County People's Government), Vice Chairman Su Shengxuan (Secretary of the Haiyan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, formerly the Deputy Head of the Haiyan County People's Government), Sanmu Tan (Mongolian) and all members, held a grand swearing-in ceremony. The people of all ethnic groups came from far away to participate in the celebration. The Mongolian and Tibetan people of various tribes and Mongolian banners enthusiastically presented flags and Hada to the Autonomous Region People's Government. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广西省大苗山地区和青海省海晏县
    分别成立苗族和藏族自治区人民政府
    广西省宜山专区大苗山苗族自治区于十一月十八日到二十六日在融水镇（旧融县城）召开首届二次各族各界人民代表会议。会议代行人民代表大会的职权，选出人民政府县长和委员，正式成立大苗山苗族自治区人民政府。
    大苗山苗族自治区原为融县、三江、罗城三县的一部分地区。境内有苗、汉、僮、侗、瑶、水家、高山等七个民族，大部分为苗族聚居区，全境十六万多人口，苗族人民近七万人。今年七月，广西省民族工作会议接受大苗山各民族人民的要求，决定成立自治区，并组成工作委员会，派遣工作队分赴该地各区进行工作。三个月来，该区已建立了十个区、一百三十五个乡的民族民主政权，进一步加强了民族团结，使大苗山各少数民族人民的政治觉悟大大提高。参加这次会议的各民族代表共二百八十五人。他们以慎重负责的态度选出了杨文贵（苗族）为县长，马振东等二十八人为委员。代表们对这次在民主团结的基础上所进行的选举非常满意，他们快乐地唱道：“门前竹子开细花，少数民族当了家，选举文贵当县长，建设苗山有办法。”
    会议通过了大苗山苗族自治区人民政府暂行组织条例和施政方针、大苗山团结公约，还讨论了人民政府的征粮办法和计划。代表们满怀信心地表示回去一定做好宣传工作，带头交纳公粮，完成征粮任务。
    大苗山苗族自治区人民政府成立的喜讯传到贝江河两岸，各族人民莫不欢欣鼓舞，从四面八方赶到大苗山苗族自治区的首府——融水镇来庆祝；有些六七十岁的苗族、侗族老大爷也从一百多里地以外赶来。各族人民兴高采烈地跳民族舞，用本民族的语言欢唱着：“各族人民一条心，永远跟着毛主席。”

    青海省海晏藏族自治区人民政府，在十一月十一日正式成立。该自治区位于青海省的青海东面。区内有藏、蒙、汉、回、土等五个民族，共一万零五百七十二人，其中藏族人民占百分之三十六。全区除小部分农业区外，大部是藏族和蒙族人民聚居的游牧区。三年来，该区在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，区内民族团结已日益加强，地方秩序已经安定。由于人民政府提倡轮牧、组织副业生产和发放畜牧贷款等工作，使畜牧生产得到恢复和发展；使各族人民生活都得到改善，加之各族人民觉悟的逐渐提高，给推行民族区域自治创造了条件。
    中共海晏县委员会和海晏县人民政府，为了贯彻执行共同纲领所规定的民族政策，在半年前即与各族人士广泛进行协商，并组成了包括各民族代表参加的区域自治筹备委员会。十月初，该县还派出五个工作组，深入牧区帐房，反复宣传“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”等文件。各族人民听了区域自治政策的宣传后，对实行民族区域自治都有了进一步的认识。
    十一月二日到五日，海晏县在召开首届第三次各族人民代表会议时，根据“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”的第四条第二款，便正式成立海晏藏族自治区人民政府。会议在民族团结基础上，还订出了自治区一九五三年畜牧业增产计划和培养少数民族干部的计划。会议并决定将在蒙族人民聚居地区成立相当于区级的蒙族自治区人民政府。
    十一月十五日，自治区人民政府主席同曲和（藏族千户、原任海晏县人民政府县长）、副主席苏胜轩（中共海晏县委员会书记、原任海晏县人民政府副县长）、三木谈（蒙族）和各委员，举行了隆重的宣誓就职典礼。各族人民从很远的地方赶来参加庆祝。各个部落和蒙旗的蒙、藏族人民，都热情地给自治区人民政府献旗和献哈达。（新华社）
