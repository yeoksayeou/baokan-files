Lan Guohuan of Renhe Village, Eleventh District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, has a three-year history of high wheat yields. His experience, after many scientific analyses and mass discussions, has long been proven to be widely applicable. We should have been "the first to benefit from the proximity," but we haven't yet promoted this experience.

When Lan Guohuan created the high wheat yield record in 1950, people who didn't see it with their own eyes said Lan Guohuan was "bragging." Even those who knew about it were skeptical, saying that Lan Guohuan had "gotten lucky." Some individuals even said, "Lan Guohuan is messing around, like a blind man picking up a donkey kick; it's just a fluke. Real farmers don't do things like that." At the time, I didn't delve deeply into Lan Guohuan's high-yield methods. I was conquered by the peasants' backward and conservative thinking, and I also thought that Lan Guohuan's high yields could only be tested on small plots, and widespread promotion would be met with resistance. I was also afraid that poor promotion would lead to lower yields and opposition from the masses. However, last year, individual households in Renhe Village and about twenty households in Lan Guohuan's mutual aid team learned Lan Guohuan's farming methods, and as a result, their grain yields doubled or tripled. At that time, although we also began to promote Lan Guohuan's farming experience, we did not systematically summarize Lan Guohuan's high-yield experience, but blindly, "selectively," and superficially promoted Lan Guohuan's high-yield methods, causing farmers to adopt only one aspect of Lan Guohuan's high-yield experience—"close planting." As a result, not only did Lan Guohuan's high-yield experience not be further confirmed among the masses, but it also created negative effects. Many farmers, without considering the specific conditions, did not plow the land or apply fertilizer, but simply increased the seeding rate by one or two times, and proudly said, "We are also planting densely planted wheat." As a result, the wheat grew scorched and yellow, and the masses called it "eight-inch ground." An old farmer in Wanlong Village planted eight mu of wheat in this way, and the wheat was short and the grains were small, yielding more than one stone less than wheat planted using old farming methods.

This year, Chairman Gao Gang proposed to double agricultural production in five or six years, and in the autumn, the county party committee proposed that Shuangcheng County should have 53,000 hectares of large-area, high-yield fields in 1953. I thought: Shuangcheng has only had one Lan Guohuan in the past five years, and large-area, high-yield fields are probably impossible. Later, the newspapers published news of nearly 10,000 hectares of large-area, high-yield land in Zhaoyuan; and in the high-yield appraisal movement in our district, many high-yield households emerged. In Renhe Village alone, there were more than thirty high-yield households, and five households met the central government's award standards. These facts shocked me. I thought, as a district head, not only could I not boldly promote advanced experience and lead the farmers to produce more grain, but I was following behind the masses, which fully demonstrates that we are taking the tailism road. The masses' enthusiasm for increasing production is high, but we have not provided leadership, causing great losses to the masses. Next year, our district plans to plant 3,000 hectares of wheat, and plans to use Lan Guohuan's method to plant half of it. We have mobilized the masses to accumulate enough manure (40 carts of mixed manure can be applied per hectare), and we have also autumn-plowed and autumn-fertilized about 3,000 hectares of land; generally, improved varieties have been exchanged. As long as our leading cadres can overcome the "general" style of the past, strengthen technical learning, earnestly summarize the masses' high-yield experience, and strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams, then Lan Guohuan's wheat high-yield method can be universally promoted in our Eleventh District.

    蓝国焕的丰产经验为什么没有在我们区里推广
    松江省双城县第十一区区长　王景山
    松江省双城县十一区仁和村蓝国焕的小麦丰产经验，已经有三年的历史；他的经验经过许多次的科学分析和群众的讨论，早已证实是可以大量推广的。我们原应是“近水楼台先得月”可是，我们还没有把这个经验推广起来。
    当一九五○年蓝国焕创造出来小麦丰产纪录时，没亲眼看见的群众说蓝国焕“吹气”；即或知道的，也是半信半疑地说：蓝国焕打了“宝场”。个别的群众还说：“蓝国焕胡整哩，瞎子拣驴蹬，套脚上啦。正经庄稼人没有那么干的。”当时我也没有深入钻研蓝国焕的丰产办法，就被农民这种落后的保守思想征服了，也认为蓝国焕的丰产，仅可以在小块园地上试验，大面积推广怕群众不接受。我并且怕推广不好少打粮遭到群众反对。可是，去年仁和村的个别户和蓝国焕互助组的二十来户学习了蓝国焕的耕作方法，结果都多打了一倍到两倍的粮食。当时，我们虽然也开始推广蓝国焕的耕作经验，可是，就没把蓝国焕的丰产经验加以系统地总结，而是盲目地、“断章取义”和一知半解地去宣传蓝国焕的丰产方法，致使农民在学习蓝国焕的丰产经验上只单纯采取一条——“密植”。结果，不但没有使蓝国焕的丰产经验在群众中得到进一步证实，相反地还造成了不良影响。很多农民不根据具体条件，地没翻，粪不上，光在播种量上增加了一、二倍，就很得意地说：“咱也种上密播小麦啦。”结果，麦子长得焦黄，群众起名叫“地八寸”。万隆村一个老乡这样种了八亩小麦，长的又矮粒又小，比用旧耕作法种的麦子还少打了一石来粮。
    今年高岗主席提出五、六年内使农业生产量提高一倍，秋季县委又提出双城县一九五三年要出现五万三千垧大面积高额丰产田。我想：五年来双城就只出现了一个蓝国焕，大面积高额丰产恐怕不可能。后来报纸上发表了肇源近万垧地大面积丰产的消息；在本区的丰产评比运动中，又出现了很多丰产户。仅仁和村一个村就有三十多户丰产户，够中央奖励标准的就有五户。这些事实使我大吃一惊。我想，我是一个区长，不但不能大胆地推广先进经验，领导农民多打粮食，反而跟在群众后面跑，这充分说明我们走了尾巴主义的道路。群众的增产情绪是高的，就是我们没有领导，给群众造成了很大损失。来年我们区计划种三千垧小麦，计划要有一半采用蓝国焕的办法种植。我们已发动群众积出了足够粪肥（每垧地可上四十车混合粪），并且还有三千来垧地作到了秋翻地、秋施肥；一般都串换了优良品种。只要我们领导干部能克服过去那种“一般化”的作风，加强技术学习，认真地去总结群众的丰产经验，加强对互助组的领导，那么，蓝国焕小麦丰产办法是有把握在我们十一区普遍推行的。（江宗昌记）
