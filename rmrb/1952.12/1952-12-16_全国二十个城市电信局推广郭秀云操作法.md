The Guo Xiuyun operation method has begun to be promoted in the telecommunications bureaus of twenty cities nationwide, achieving significant results. It has improved the circuit utilization rate of long-distance telephone calls and promoted the production reform work of postal and telecommunications enterprises.

In July of this year, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of China formed a working group to systematically summarize the basic characteristics of the Guo Xiuyun operation method, and compiled a relatively complete set of advanced operation methods for long-distance switchboard operators. From October 22nd to November 1st, a national conference on promoting the Guo Xiuyun operation method was held in Beijing. The conference requested that leading cadres of telecommunications bureaus in various regions regard the promotion of the Guo Xiuyun operation method as an important task, and implement the spirit of the Guo Xiuyun operation method in all business departments, making it a signpost guiding the production reform of postal and telecommunications enterprises. After the meeting, postal and telecommunications bureaus in various regions held meetings to convey the basic characteristics of the Guo Xiuyun operation method and reviewed the shortcomings of not paying enough attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in the past. Long-distance switchboard operators in Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Yingkou and other places criticized the incorrect ideas that "telephone work has no advanced experience" and "telephone work has no future" in the past and were determined to learn the Guo Xiuyun operation method.

Now, postal and telecommunications bureaus in various regions have begun to promote the Guo Xiuyun operation method. Telecommunications bureaus in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Jinan, Changsha, Qingdao, Harbin and other places have successively established special groups to promote the Guo Xiuyun operation method, and formulated specific steps and methods for promotion. The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau opened a "little teacher" study class, where each operator learns the Guo Xiuyun operation method for two hours every day, and some operators have already learned the Guo Xiuyun operation method. The Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau held a promotion conference for the Guo Xiuyun operation method, at which specific challenge conditions were adopted to challenge the long-distance station staff in large and medium-sized cities across the country, and a practical performance of the Guo Xiuyun operation method was held. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has comprehensively launched a campaign to promote the Guo Xiuyun operation method, striving to be a model bureau for promoting the Guo Xiuyun operation method. After the switchboard operators of long-distance stations in Hefei, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing and other places studied the Guo Xiuyun operation method, they signed contact contracts, which effectively promoted the promotion of the Guo Xiuyun operation method.

After learning and promoting the Guo Xiuyun operation method, long-distance stations of telecommunications bureaus in various regions have improved the utilization rate of circuits and improved their work. Within two weeks of focusing on promoting the Guo Xiuyun operation method, the long-distance station of the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau increased the circuit utilization rate by 6.7%. 69% of the operators in the bureau have learned the Guo Xiuyun operation method. The switchboard operators of the Hangxian Telephone Office shortened the time for connecting calls and completed nine calls in 20 minutes.

In the process of promoting the Guo Xiuyun operation method, postal and telecommunications bureaus in various regions vigorously criticized capitalist management ideas and departmentalism, and exposed old regulations and old systems that hindered enterprise progress. Some telecommunications bureaus in the past were unwilling to accept more military, government and enterprise calls, believing that accepting more commercial calls could increase revenue. Some telecommunications bureau operators simply wanted to complete the task, and would not let users cancel their numbers, and insisted on persuading users to make urgent calls in order to make more money. Telecommunications bureaus in various regions criticized these ideas and clarified that enterprise telephone calls mainly serve the country's military, economic and cultural construction undertakings. The departmentalism idea of "giving priority to outgoing calls" generally existed in telecommunications bureaus in various regions. A telephone operator at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau even falsely claimed that a general citizen's telephone call was a military or government telephone call in order to connect his outgoing call as soon as possible. In the past, maintenance personnel and operators often could not coordinate their work. When machines malfunctioned, maintenance personnel did not repair them in a timely manner, which affected the calls. The old system stipulated that the called number could not be changed. For example, an urgent call could not be changed to an ordinary call. This regulation caused user dissatisfaction. With the promotion of the Guo Xiuyun operation method and the criticism of the above-mentioned erroneous ideas and unreasonable rules and regulations, the postal and telecommunications enterprise departments will launch a large-scale production reform movement.

    全国二十个城市电信局推广郭秀云操作法
    提高了长途电话的电路利用率，推动了邮电企业生产改革的工作
    全国二十个城市的电信局开始推广郭秀云操作法，已获得显著成绩。今年七月，中央邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会组成工作组，系统地总结了郭秀云操作法的基本特点，整理出一套比较完整的长途接续台话务员的先进操作法，并在十月二十二日到十一月一日在北京召开了全国推广郭秀云操作法的会议。会议要求各地电信局领导干部把推广郭秀云操作法，作为重要的任务，并把郭秀云操作法的精神贯彻到各个业务部门中去，使它成为指引邮电企业生产改革的路标。会后，各地邮电局都分别召开了会议，传达了郭秀云操作法的基本特点，并检查了过去不重视总结和推广先进经验的缺点。青岛、张家口、营口等地长途台话务员批判了过去认为“话务工作没有先进经验”、“话务工作没有前途”等不正确的思想，决心学习郭秀云操作法。
    现在各地邮电局已开始推广郭秀云操作法，北京、天津、上海、汉口、济南、长沙、青岛、哈尔滨等地的电信局，都先后成立了推广郭秀云操作法的专门小组，订出了推广的具体步骤和办法。北京电信局开办了“小先生”学习班，每个话务员每天学习郭秀云操作法两小时，有些话务员已经学会了郭秀云操作法。天津电信局召开了郭秀云操作法推广大会，会上并通过具体的挑战条件，向全国大、中城市长途台职工挑战，并举行了郭秀云操作法的实际表演。上海电信局已全面展开了推广郭秀云操作法的运动，争取做推广郭秀云操作法的模范局。合肥、蚌埠、芜湖、安庆等地长途台值机员学习郭秀云操作法之后，签订了联系合同，有力地推动了郭秀云操作法的推广工作。
    各地电信局长途台学习和推广郭秀云操作法以后，提高了电路的利用率，改进了工作。天津电信局长途台在重点推广了郭秀云操作法的两周内，就把电路利用率提高了百分之六点七。该局已有百分之六十九的话务员学会了郭秀云操作法。杭县电话所的值机员缩短了接通电话的时间，在二十分钟内完成了九次通话的任务。
    在推广郭秀云操作法的过程中，各地邮电局有力地批判了资本主义的经营思想、本位主义思想，暴露了阻碍企业进步的旧规章和旧制度。有的电信局过去不愿多接军政、企业电话，认为多接商话能多增加收入。有的电信局话务员单纯地为了完成任务，不让用户销号，硬要劝用户打加急电，以便多赚钱。各地电信局批判了这些思想，明确了企业电话主要是为国家的军事、经济和文化建设事业服务的。各地电信局曾普遍地存在着“以去话为主”的本位思想。北京电信局一个话务员为了要尽先接通自己向外的发话，竟然把一般市民的电话说成是军政的电话。过去机务人员和话务员常常不能协调地进行工作。机器发生了故障，机务人员不及时修理，影响了通话。过去旧制度规定：不能改变叫号。如加急电话不能改为普通电话。这种规定，曾引起用户的不满。随着郭秀云操作法的推广，批判了上述错误思想和不合理的规章制度，邮电企业部门将掀起一个大规模的生产改革运动。
