    Lü Huanzhang and Lü Hongyan Actively Assist the Government in Tax Inspection

    To the Editor: Lü Huanzhang and Lü Hongyan, workers at the private Huaxingdong Copper Buckle Manufacturing Factory in Qiqihar City, actively assist the government in inspecting tax evasion by private enterprises. On September 3, comrades from the Qiqihar City Tax Bureau came to the Huaxingdong Copper Buckle Manufacturing Factory to take stock. After counting the galvanized iron sheets placed outside, the capitalist said, "That's all!" Lü Huanzhang and Lü Hongyan then said:
    "That's not right! There are still some on the shed roof!" They climbed onto the shed roof to check, and even though their feet were pricked, they insisted on finishing the count, discovering dozens of galvanized iron sheets on the shed that were not on the books. They searched everywhere and uncovered a total of 4.4 million yuan worth of off-book goods. The capitalist had no choice but to admit that he had deliberately hidden them. After work, Lü Huanzhang and Lü Hongyan led the comrades from the Tax Bureau to the private Yongxing Factory to compare accounts, and exposed the illegal behavior of the capitalist Chen Qiaonian, who concealed solder and evaded taxes.

    吕焕章吕鸿彦积极协助政府查税
    编辑同志：齐齐哈尔市私营华兴东铜扣制造工厂工人吕焕章和吕鸿彦，积极协助政府检查私营企业偷税漏税行为。九月三日，齐齐哈尔市税务局的同志到华兴东铜扣制造厂点货，把摆在外面的洋铁瓦点完后，资方说：“没有啦！”吕焕章、吕鸿彦就说：
    “不对！棚顶上还有呢！”并攀到棚顶上去查点，脚被扎破了还坚持点完，发现棚上有几十张账上没有的洋铁瓦。他们又到各处寻找，共查出四百四十万元的账外货。资方没有办法只得承认是自己故意隐藏的。下班后，吕焕章和吕鸿彦又领着税务局同志到私营永兴工厂去对照户头，又揭发了资方陈乔年隐瞒焊锡偷税漏税的违法行为。
