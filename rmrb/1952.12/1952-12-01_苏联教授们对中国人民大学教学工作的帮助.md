In just two short years, Renmin University of China, under the leadership of Comrade Wu Yuzhang, has achieved remarkable results in its work by implementing the correct educational policy stipulated by the Central Committee of "integrating teaching with practice and combining Soviet experience with Chinese conditions." In these two years, it has trained more than 2,300 cadres of various specialties for the country; established 38 teaching and research sections, trained approximately 600 professors and teachers, and also trained approximately 400 teachers and graduate students for other universities; translated approximately 300 kinds of lecture notes and published a total of more than 1,200 kinds of teaching materials, totaling approximately 1.78 million copies. We have established a complete teaching plan, strictly stipulating the subjects, procedures, hours, and methods of teaching; we have also learned from the advanced Soviet teaching methods (from lecturing, tutoring, classroom discussions, quizzes, examinations—oral exams—to production internships). Our specialized courses have also developed a set of formal plans, organization, and methods for short-term training of various professional cadres. These achievements are inseparable from the earnest help of the Soviet professors. We thank all the Soviet professors who have come to our school from afar, braving hardship, to help with the teaching work. We thank the profound friendship of the Soviet people, and we deeply thank Stalin!

Recalling two years ago, when the teaching and research sections of our school were just established, there were only a few staff members, and most of them lacked professional knowledge and work experience; some comrades therefore lacked confidence in their work, and even individual comrades had emotional fluctuations and requested to change jobs. It was precisely at this time that the Soviet professors came to our school to guide the work of the teaching and research sections. The school leaders patiently persuaded and educated the comrades based on their various ideological situations, gradually clarifying certain confused ideas and stabilizing the comrades' emotions; and clearly recognizing the direction of the work of the teaching and research sections, pointing out the importance of the work of the teaching and research sections in the entire teaching work, as well as its important significance for national construction. This enabled the working comrades to establish confidence in the work. Soviet professors not only provided theoretical guidance to our working comrades, but also personally participated in the teaching and research sections, undertaking the task of writing lecture notes and teaching materials, as well as lecturing. After work, they often gave specific guidance to the working comrades of the teaching and research sections: how to do the administrative work of the teaching and research section, how to do secretarial work, how to lead the work of the teaching and research section, how to make work plans, how to establish a reference room… They even told our working comrades how to place books, how to organize and keep files and materials, how to compile catalogs, and so on. When our working comrades had a slight clue about administrative work, they were very happy. For example, when they saw that our comrades could write their own plans, they encouraged them by saying, "Look, you can make your own plans!" Under their encouragement, the courage of our working comrades to move forward was further increased.

Our respected friends—the Soviet professors—while guiding and helping our school to establish teaching and research sections, also helped us train new types of university teachers. They often said: "The task of our Soviet comrades who have come to China is to help New China cultivate its own experts." Indeed, they have really put a lot of effort into this: in the beginning, our new teachers did not know how to lecture, so they first conducted demonstration teaching and introduced their advanced experience. Before each class, they would always give the new teachers eight or nine hours of lectures, and also spend four or five hours tutoring them. For the next day's class, they often lectured and tutored the new teachers overnight. They were very concerned about our teachers. They always followed the teachers to listen to the class. After class, they patiently guided the teachers on how to use their mother tongue, how to grasp the students' emotions, how to use the blackboard and utilize charts. Because our young teachers did not have teaching experience, many shortcomings often occurred in the teaching process. While sternly pointing out the shortcomings, they always comforted them by saying: "Of course, this is inevitable for young teachers," "Even a good teacher will always have difficulties in front of them." Sometimes, at the teacher-student forum, students raised opinions to the young teachers. In order to prevent the young teachers from being discouraged, they always emphasized: "Although our teachers have some shortcomings in teaching methods, their work is successful and they have made progress; because none of the opinions raised by the students are principled or theoretical errors, and the shortcomings in technology and methods can be corrected quickly." This encouraged the young teachers' confidence in the teaching work. What is even more touching is that when teachers have questions, they are always so patient in explaining until the teachers thoroughly understand. They couldn't wait to give all their valuable experience to the Chinese people. As Professor Lyazov said: "No matter day or night, if you have any questions, come to me! We won't be in China for long, everyone should make full use of us, and we should also do our best to tell everyone what we know without reservation."

In addition, Soviet professors also often guide teachers in conducting scientific research, applying Soviet advanced experience to Chinese practice. For example, when a factory in Shenyang achieved preliminary results in implementing "organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts," Comrade Yoffe, the Soviet professor of the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Section, immediately organized teachers to conduct research. They also often organize teachers to study relevant Chinese materials and carefully guide teachers in writing lecture notes in a planned manner. They require teachers to follow the following steps when writing lecture notes: first, make a catalog of relevant reference books and a card index of materials for the chapter of lecture notes being written, then write the outline of the lecture notes, and after writing, discuss and revise it through the teaching and research section, and finally send it to the relevant business department, and write the lecture notes only after obtaining consent (after writing, it must be repeatedly revised). Soviet professors often pointed out to the teachers that scientific research work must be combined with the work of writing lecture notes. This clear instruction enabled the teachers to gain training in combining theory and practice, combining advanced Soviet experience with specific Chinese conditions in the writing process, enabling the teachers to understand how to apply advanced Soviet experience, thereby enriching the content of the lecture notes, initially implementing the teaching policy, and further improving the teaching work. Under the patient cultivation of Soviet professors, the number of teachers in our school has developed from 55 to nearly 600. They have basically been able to master a course; most comrades have also started scientific research work. In two years, they have written a total of 242 papers, and the lecture notes they have written reached 34 kinds (201 chapters have been completed) in the second academic year alone. Their political and ideological level has also greatly improved.

What is most worthy of our learning here is the selfless labor attitude of the Soviet professors. They love labor and regard labor as the greatest pleasure and enjoyment, as the first need of life. Comrade Le Mizhuovich, an old professor in his fifties, was busy from morning to night for several days, but he said with great enthusiasm: "These days are my good days." Professor Gogol once said to our teachers: "I have been teaching for eighteen years since I started teaching, and I have to prepare before each lecture; and I have established a system for myself: to add new content in each lecture." Another example is Comrade Ke Lie of the Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism Teaching and Research Section, who once deleted a small philosophical booklet. After printing it, she found a few small errors, and she was very uneasy, so she proofread it from beginning to end. What is even more touching is that many Soviet professors often complete their work assignments despite being sick. Once, Professor Volkov lectured for three consecutive hours. Suddenly, his face turned red and his eyes were tightly closed. The comrades persuaded him to rest, but he refused and insisted on lecturing until noon before leaving class. After Professor Bolianin came to our country, he suffered from acclimatization, and his body temperature increased to about 39 degrees Celsius. He coughed every night and couldn't sleep well, but he always worked day and night to prepare for teaching, insisting on lecturing and tutoring. Professor Aogayang once injured one eye in a specialized course due to a bulb explosion, but he insisted on lecturing for six hours that day.

In the past two years, the great internationalist spirit, selfless labor attitude, and serious and responsible work style of the Soviet professors have profoundly educated us and made us realize what kind of work attitude and work style a revolutionary cadre and scientific worker should have. We should learn from them more humbly and diligently, especially today when our motherland is about to begin large-scale economic construction, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in all aspects, and learning from the model examples of the Soviet professors, which is of paramount practical significance.

    苏联教授们对中国人民大学教学工作的帮助
    俞圣祺
    在短短的两年中，中国人民大学由于在吴玉章同志的领导下，执行了中央规定的“教学与实际联系，苏联经验与中国情况相结合”的正确教育方针，在工作上取得了显著的成绩。两年中，已为国家培养了二千三百多个各种专业的干部；建立了三十八个教研室，培养了教授、教员约六百人，而且为其他高等学校培养了教员与研究生约四百人；翻译了讲义约三百种，出版教材总计有一千二百多种，约一百七十八万册。我们已建立了一套完整的教学计划，严格地规定了教学的科目、程序、时数和方法；我们也学习了苏联的先进教学方法（从讲授、辅导、课堂讨论、测验、考试——口试到生产实习）。我们的专修科在短期训练各种专业干部方面也有了
    一套正规的计划、组织和方法。这些成绩是和苏联教授们的殷切帮助分不开的。我们感谢远离祖国不辞劳苦来到我校帮助教学工作的全体苏联教授们，我们感谢苏联人民的深厚友谊，我们深深感谢斯大林！
    回忆两年以前，当我们学校的教研室刚刚成立的时候，只有几个工作人员，而且他们多半缺乏业务知识和工作经验；有些同志因而对工作缺乏信心，甚至有个别同志情绪波动，要求调换工作。恰恰在这时候，苏联教授们就来到了我们的学校，指导教研室的工作。学校领导方面便根据同志们的各种思想情况，耐心地进行说服、教育，逐渐澄清了某些混乱思想，稳定了同志们的情绪；并明确认识了教研室工作的方向，指明了教研室工作在整个教学工作中的重要性，以及对国家建设的重要意义。这样就使工作同志对工作树立起胜利的信心。苏联教授们不仅在理论上给我们的工作同志以指导，同时，并亲身参加到教研室中去，担任编写讲义和教材以及讲课的任务。在工作之余，他们经常给教研室的工作同志以具体指导：如何做教研室的行政工作，如何做秘书工作，如何领导教研室的工作，如何订工作计划，如何建立资料室……甚至更告诉我们的工作同志如何放置图书，如何整理和保管文件资料，如何编排目录等等。当我们工作同志对行政业务工作稍有头绪时，他们就显得很高兴。比如当他们看到我们的同志能自己编写出计划时，就鼓励着说：“看，你们自己能制订计划了！”在他们的鼓舞下，更增加了我们工作同志前进的勇气。
    我们敬爱的友人——苏联教授们，在指导和帮助我校建立教研室的同时，还帮助我们培养新型的高等学校教员。他们常说：“我们来到中国的苏联同志们的任务，就是要帮助新中国培养出自己的专家来。”真的，他们在这方面确是煞费苦心的：开始时，我们的新教员不会讲课，他们就先进行示范教学，介绍他们的先进经验。每次上课前，他们总要给新教员讲八九小时的课，并且还用四、五小时的时间进行辅导。为了第二天的课，他们常常连夜给新教员讲课和辅导。他们很关心我们的教员，上课时他们总是跟着教员去听课，下课后，他们就耐心地指导教员们如何运用自己祖国的语言，如何掌握学生的情绪，如何使用黑板、利用图表。因为我们的青年教员们没有教学经验，在教学过程中往往发生很多的缺点，他们一边严正地指出了缺点，一边总是安慰着说：“当然，这对年青教员来说是很难免的”，
    “即使一个好的教员，在他们面前也总是有困难的”。有时在师生座谈会上，同学们给年青的教员提出了意见，他们为了使年青的教员不灰心，总是着重地指出：“我们的教员虽然在教学方法上存在着某些缺点，但是他们的工作是有成绩的，他们已经有了进步；因为在同学们所提的意见中，没有一个是原则性或理论性的错误，至于技术和方法上的缺点是很快可以纠正的。”这样就鼓舞了年青教员对教学工作的信心。更使人感动的是，当教员有问题时，他们总是那样耐心地解释，直到教员彻底了解为止。他们恨不得把自己的宝贵经验，一古脑交给中国人民。正如廖左夫教授所说：“不管白天和黑夜，有问题就找我吧！我们在中国是不会很久的，大家应该尽量利用我们，我们也应该以最大努力来把我们所知道的无保留地告诉给大家。”
    此外，苏联教授们还经常指导教员们进行科学研究，把苏联的先进经验运用于中国实际。例如当沈阳某厂实行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”取得初步成绩时，工业企业组织与计划教研室的苏联教授约菲同志马上就组织教员进行研究。他们更经常组织教员们学习有关中国的材料，并有计划地认真地指导教员们编写讲义。他们要求教员们编写讲义时必须按照下列步骤进行：首先做所写这一章讲义的有关参考书目录和资料卡片索引，然后写讲义提纲，写好后再经教研室讨论和修改，最后送到有关业务部门，待征得同意后才写讲义（写成后还要经过反复的修改）。苏联教授们常向教员们指出，科学研究工作必须和编写讲义的工作结合起来。这个明确的指示，使教员们在写作过程中获得了理论和实际相结合、苏联先进经验和中国具体情况相结合的锻炼，使教员们懂得如何运用苏联先进经验，从而充实了讲义的内容，初步贯彻了教学方针，进一步提高了教学工作。在苏联教授们的耐心培养下，我校教员已由五十五人发展到将近六百人，他们基本上已能掌握一门课程；多数同志并开始了科学研究工作。他们在两年中共写出论文二百四十二篇，编写的讲义仅第二学年就达三十四种（已完成二百零一章），他们的政治思想水平也有很大的提高。
    在这里最值得我们学习的就是苏联教授们的忘我的劳动态度了。他们热爱劳动，把劳动看做是最大的愉快和享受，看作生活的第一需要。五十多岁的老教授莱米卓维奇同志，有好几天从清早忙到夜里，可是他眉飞色舞地说：“这几天是我的好日子。”果戈里教授曾经对我们教员说：“我从开始教课到现在已经十八年了，在每次讲课之前，我都要进行准备；并且自己订立了一个制度：在每次讲课中要增添新内容。”又如辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义教研室的克列同志，曾经删节一本哲学小册子，打印后发现有几处小错误，她就很不放心，又把它从头到尾校阅了一遍。更使我们感动的是，很多苏联教授往往抱病完成工作任务。有一次，伏尔科夫教授连续讲了三小时的课，忽然他的脸孔绯红了，眼睛紧闭着。同志们劝他休息，他不愿意，一直坚持讲到中午才下课。鲍里亚宁教授来到我国以后，因水土不服，体温增高到摄氏三十九度左右，每天晚上咳嗽，睡不熟，但他总是昼夜不停地做教学准备工作，坚持着讲课和辅导工作。奥高扬教授有一次在专修科讲课时，因灯泡爆炸伤了一只眼睛，可是他在当天还坚持讲了六个钟头的课。
    两年来，苏联教授们的伟大国际主义精神，忘我的劳动态度，认真负责的工作作风……深刻地教育了我们，使我们认识到一个革命的干部和科学工作者应该具有怎样的工作态度和工作作风。我们应该更虚心、更努力地向他们学习，特别在我们祖国即将开始大规模经济建设的今天，学习苏联各方面的先进经验，学习苏联教授们的模范榜样，更具有头等重要的现实意义。
