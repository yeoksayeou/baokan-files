    At the National Geological Work Planning Conference
    Vice Premier Chen Yun's Speech

    In 1953, China will begin large-scale economic construction. In order to adapt to the new needs of the country, next year's geological work will also undergo a major shift to serve the needs of the country.

    Previously, geological work was done on an ad-hoc basis, without a national plan. Now, things are different. Geological work must be based on the country's needs, and currently, more specifically, on the needs of the iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, and fuel industry, to explore and determine a certain amount of minerals within a certain period of time. This is the first time such a thing has happened in China. It shows that geological work has become one of the most important undertakings in the country's economic construction.

    Next year's geological workload will increase by ten to twenty-three times compared to this year, with drilling increasing tenfold, pit exploration increasing twentyfold, trench exploration increasing twenty-threefold, and survey area increasing tenfold. The tasks for the year after that will be even greater than next year; 1955 will be even more demanding than 1954. In order to complete these tasks, the vast majority of geological personnel will participate in mineral exploration, general surveys, and other field geological work next year. Although many people have participated in field geological work in the past, quite a few have remained in the office. This situation must be further changed next year.

    In order to complete the huge task of geological work, effective methods must also be used to train new geological talents. Northeast China, Beijing, and other regions have already recruited several thousand students, who can participate in geological work after one, two, or four years of study. Such a large team for geological work is unprecedented in Chinese history. We must use advanced teaching methods to train them. We place great hope in them, hoping that they will immediately participate in national construction after graduation. This training task is a major task of the Ministry of Geology and also a major task of the Chinese geological community.

    A large number of geological personnel working in the field and the large-scale training of geological talents are both unprecedented. This marks the beginning of a major transformation in our country—from a state of economic dilapidation and stagnation to large-scale economic construction, from backwardness to advancement.

    Of course, there are many difficulties facing geological workers, and these difficulties also exist in other departments. The main difficulty is that the task is large, but the strength is small. It is wrong to deny this difficulty. We must face this difficulty squarely and actively solve it.

    There are two approaches to dealing with this difficulty.

    One approach is to define the task of geological work according to the existing strength. Should we adopt this approach? No, we shouldn't. Because adopting this approach would delay the progress of geological work, delay the construction progress of the ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, and fuel industries, and thus delay the progress of China's industrialization. China has been bullied for hundreds of years because of its economic backwardness. Now that the country has been liberated and the people's democratic regime has been established, if we do not carry out large-scale economic construction, the victory of the Chinese revolution will not be guaranteed. Therefore, in deciding the direction of geological work, we should not only consider the current difficulties of the geological department, but first consider the needs of the country, that is, first consider how to accelerate the country's economic construction.

    Another approach is to strive to complete the national plan according to the needs of the country. If the strength is not enough, we will study ways to increase the strength. The result of our joint discussion is to adopt this approach. Adopting this approach is difficult, but it is much better than the first approach.

    How to increase strength? There are three sources of strength:

    1. Increase new manpower and tools. The main way to increase manpower is to set up new schools and training courses. We need university or high school students, but there are not enough university and high school students to allocate. Therefore, we can also consider recruiting junior high school students, and use simple methods to train them for one or two years so that they can participate in simple work. It is necessary to adopt the method of apprenticeship to train a large number of cadres. Only in this way can we quickly strengthen the geological work force.

    2. Rational use of talent. There are very few geological workers now, and they are also very scattered, so we should pay more attention to rational use. How can we achieve rational use? We should pay attention to the following aspects:

    We must have unified dispatching on a national scale and rationally allocate resources according to the needs of the country. From next year onwards, all income of the financial system in all parts of the country will be turned over to the central Ministry of Finance; larger factories in various places will also be uniformly managed by the central government. Geological workers should also be like these departments and be uniformly transferred by the central government. Every comrade engaged in geological work should have this ideological preparation of obeying the needs of the country and obeying the transfer. Geological departments in various places should also be prepared to move the entire organization when the work requires it. Because only in this way can we act in a unified manner and exert our strength.

    New and old personnel should be used rationally. Some of the current field work teams are all old personnel, and some are all new personnel. This phenomenon should be changed. The old staff should be dispersed to take on more apprentices, so as to expand the geological work force. Taking on new students is troublesome, but strength cannot be increased without trouble. In order to meet the requirements of the country and the people, we must not be afraid of trouble.

    Comrades working indoors and outdoors should also have a reasonable allocation. We must use the strength in key places and not let those places lack manpower.

    The old cadres in the geological department should also be used rationally, so that they and the technical personnel of geological work can make a reasonable division of labor. Geological work technicians should mainly engage in geological work, and old cadres should engage in more administrative work. This will enable everyone to exert their due effectiveness. If geological personnel run around and are busy with administrative work, it is a waste of manpower. Of course, administrative work is not simple, and there are many things that need to be done. We entrust this work to old cadres, who can do it and have experience. Can old cadres also learn geological work? As long as they work hard to study for a long time, many people can learn it.

    3. Improve the skills of the original geological personnel. This point is of great significance. Before explaining this issue, we should first give an appropriate assessment of the past geological work. In the past two or three years, geological workers have done work and have achieved certain results, which should be affirmed. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, geological workers have also done work in the past few decades, and these works have also been beneficial to the motherland, which should also be affirmed.

    However, it should be known that the work we have done is still far from the requirements put forward by the country today. The work we have done in the past is far from meeting today's needs. This is mainly reflected in two aspects: one is that there are too few geological personnel, and the other is that the geological work we have done before has focused more on geological research and less on actual exploration work, and the work is not comprehensive. This is the shortcoming of the status quo.

    We must admit that the number of geological personnel is small and the skills are not enough. This responsibility does not lie with the geological personnel. Chinese geological workers are not unable to develop good skills, but because there was no good environment in the past.

    Now, geological workers have great responsibilities, and geological work is related to other aspects of work, and the progress of geological work has a great impact on national economic construction. Therefore, comrades in the geological community should consciously stand on the people's position, realize the importance of responsibility, and consider issues not from a personal perspective, but more from the perspective of national tasks, which is good for the country and for individuals.

    How can we improve the skills of existing geological personnel? That is, we must be determined to study hard. There are three ways to learn:

    1. Regularly summarize experiences and lessons. We must learn from successful experiences, and especially learn from failed experiences. This is a good way to reduce our mistakes. It is impossible for everyone to make mistakes in doing things. One type of person feels embarrassed when they make a mistake; another type of person regards failure as the mother of success and draws experience and lessons from failure. The latter attitude is obviously correct. The Ministry of Geology can hold two or three such meetings every year to systematically summarize experiences and lessons. In addition, this should also be done on every construction site and every work post.

    To learn from mistakes, we must overcome a tendency, that is, the tendency to cover up mistakes. This tendency exists in the technical community, and there are also such people among our Communist Party members. This behavior is not good and is not good for work or for oneself. If you want to cover up mistakes, the more you are afraid of losing face, the more you will lose face. On the contrary, if you admit mistakes and admit that your skills are not good, then you are likely not to lose face in the future. It is not surprising that our skills are not high, which is in line with the situation in China in the past. We can recognize this point, and then move forward from this point, and we will make progress.

    2. Learn from those around you, from above and below you, that is, learn from your peers, learn from your superiors and subordinates, especially learn from your subordinates. We should form an atmosphere of holding meetings to discuss and consult at any time. Put forward proposals, not afraid of the other party's criticism, because only through mutual discussion can the proposals be more reasonable and the work be further advanced. At present, this atmosphere of mutual discussion is very thin, and the atmosphere of learning from subordinates is even thinner. This phenomenon should be changed.

    3. Learn from Soviet experience. Soviet experience integrates the world's highest technical achievements and improves and perfects them. By accepting Soviet experience, we are also accepting the world's most advanced experience. Some people say that we also have a very high culture and scientific inventions that have a historical status, which of course cannot be denied. But these achievements, like things locked in a warehouse, will not be lost because we learn from the Soviet Union. Now we should first learn what we don't have.

    To learn, we must get rid of burdens. We must face reality and adopt an honest attitude. We have full confidence that as long as we study hard, outstanding talents will surely emerge in the geological community in the future.

    Our administrative personnel should seize every opportunity to help technical personnel improve. In the past, the work of administrative personnel had shortcomings: on the one hand, they did not criticize the mistakes and shortcomings of technical personnel's work, which was not good for things or people; on the other hand, they underestimated the importance of technical personnel's work and did not use all possible means to help them learn and improve. This shortcoming should be corrected in the future.

    Our task is arduous, and we will certainly make some mistakes in our work. Of course, we will also encounter sabotage by counter-revolutionaries in our great economic construction process, because they want our construction to fail. We must keep our eyes open, be vigilant, and not be careless. But the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries and the mistakes in work should be distinguished, and can be distinguished. This is not a very difficult thing, we can distinguish them based on a person's history, work experience, and regular work attitude.

    Mistakes in work can be roughly divided into two types: one is the mistake caused by carelessness and rashness, which is not good. Those who make this kind of mistake should be careful and pay attention, and take the mistake as a lesson in work. The other is that although we have been careful and cautious in our work, we may still make mistakes, which is more common in the process of creation and invention. For such mistakes, we should not be discouraged; for such people, we should give encouragement, learn from the mistakes, and continue to move forward.

    We admit that next year's work will be difficult. We must overcome difficulties, improve our skills, increase our strength, learn from those around us, from above and below us, learn from successful and failed experiences and lessons, and learn from the Soviet Union. Only in this way can difficulties be overcome. Our responsibility is heavy, and I hope comrades will work hard to complete the great task that the motherland has given us!

    在全国地质工作计划会议上
    陈云副总理的讲话
    一九五三年我国将开始大规模的经济建设。为了适应国家新的需要，明年的地质工作，也要进行一个大的转变，以便使地质工作服从国家的需要。
    从前，地质工作是做多少算多少，国家没有整个计划。现在不同了，地质工作要根据国家的需要，目前更应根据钢铁工业、有色金属工业以及燃料工业等的需要，在一定时间以内，探明一定的矿量。这种情况，在中国还是第一次发生。这说明地质事业，在国家经济建设中已成了一项最重要的事业了。
    明年地质工作的工作量，比今年要增加十倍至二十三倍，其中钻探增加十倍，坑探增加二十倍，槽探增加二十三倍，调查面积增加十倍。后年的任务比明年更多；一九五五年比一九五四年还会多。为了完成这些任务，绝大部分地质人员明年都要参加探矿、普查及其他野外地质工作。过去虽然也有很多人参加了野外地质工作，但留在室内工作的还不少。明年必须进一步改变这一情况。
    为了完成地质工作的巨大任务，还要用有效的办法训练新的地质人材。东北、北京及其他各地，已招收了几千学生，他们经过一年、二年或四年的学习，就可参加地质工作。这样大的地质工作的队伍，在中国历史上是空前的。我们一定要用先进的教学方法来训练他们。我们对他们寄以极大的希望，希望他们毕业后马上参加国家的建设。这项训练任务，是地质部的重大任务，也是中国地质界的重大任务。
    大批地质人员到野外工作，大批训练地质人材，这些事都是空前的。这标志着我们国家开始了大的转变——由经济的破败和停滞状态转变到大规模的经济建设，由落后转向先进。
    当然，摆在地质工作者面前的困难是很多的，这些困难在其他部门也同样存在。最主要的困难就是：任务大，力量小。否认这个困难是错误的。我们必须正视这个困难，积极解决这个困难。
    对待这个困难有两种方针。
    一种方针是按照现有的力量规定地质工作的任务。我们应不应该采取这一方针呢？不应该。因为采取这一方针就要推迟地质工作的进度，推迟黑色金属、有色金属、燃料工业等的建设进度，因而也就推迟我国工业化的进度。中国几百年来受人欺侮，就由于经济落后。现在全国解放了，人民民主政权建立了，如果还不进行大规模的经济建设，则中国革命的胜利是没有保障的。因此决定地质工作的方针，就不应该只考虑地质部门目前的困难，而应该首先考虑国家的需要，也就是首先考虑如何加速国家的经济建设的问题。
    另一种方针，就是按照国家的需要，力争完成国家的计划。力量不够，就研究增加力量的方法。我们共同讨论的结果，是采取这一个方针。采取这个方针是有困难的，但它比第一个方针好得多。
    怎样增加力量呢？力量的来源有三：
    一、增加新的人力和工具。增加人力的主要办法是办新的学校和训练班。我们需要大学生或高中学生，但大学生和高中学生不够分配。因此我们也可以考虑招收初中学生，用简易的办法，训练一年二年，使他们能参加简易的工作。采取带徒弟的办法，大量培养干部，这样的作法是必需的。只有这样，才能迅速壮大地质工作的力量。
    二、合理地使用人材。现在地质工作人员很少也很分散，因此更应注意合理使用。如何才能作到合理使用呢？应该注意以下几个方面：
    要在全国范围内统一调度，按国家的需要合理分配。从明年起，全国各地财政系统的一切收入统统要交中央财政部；地方上的较大的工厂也要统一交中央管理。地质工作人员也应该同这些部门一样，由中央统一调动。每一个作地质工作的同志，都应该有这种服从国家需要，听从调动的思想准备。各地的地质部门，也应该准备当工作需要时，整个机关都要搬家。因为只有如此，才能统一行动，发挥力量。
    新老人员要合理使用。现在的野外工作队，有的全是老的人员，有的全是新的人员。这种现象应该加以改变。要把老的工作人员分散开来，让他们多带徒弟，这样才能扩大地质工作的力量。带新学生是麻烦事，但不麻烦就不能增长力量。为了适应国家和人民的要求，我们要不怕麻烦。
    室内和室外工作的同志也要有合理的调配。要把力量使用到关键的地方，不能让那些地方人力不足。
    地质部门中的老干部也要合理地使用，要使他们和地质工作的技术人员作合理的分工。地质工作技术人员主要的应该担任地质工作，老干部则应多作行政工作。这才能使大家都发挥应有的效力。如果地质人员东奔西走，忙于行政工作，这是人力的浪费。当然，行政工作也不简单，需要办的事情很多。我们把这项工作委托给老干部去做，他们是可以做，而且是有经验的。老干部是不是也可以学会地质工作呢？只要自己长期地努力学习，很多人也是可以学会的。
    三、提高原有地质人员的本领。这一条有极重大的意义。在说明这一问题之前，首先应当对过去地质工作给予适当的估计。过去两三年来，地质工作人员是作了工作的，也有一定的成绩，这是应该肯定的。在中华人民共和国成立以前，过去几十年来，地质工作人员也做了工作，这些工作对祖国也是有益的，这也是应该肯定的。
    但是应该知道，我们已经做了的工作，和今天国家所提出的要求相比，仍然是相差很远的。我们过去所做的工作，远远赶不上今天的需要。这主要表现在两个方面，一是地质人员还太少，一是我们以前所做的地质工作是地质研究多，实际勘探工作少，工作不全面。这就是现状的缺点。
    我们必须承认，地质人员的数目不多，本领不够。这责任不在于地质人员。中国的地质工作人员并不是不能造就出好的本领，而是因为过去没有良好的环境。
    现在，地质工作者的责任很大，地质工作关系着其他各方面的工作，地质工作的进度对国家经济建设影响很大。因此，地质界的同志们，应当自觉地站在人民的立场，认识到责任的重大，考虑问题时不从个人角度出发，而多从国家的任务出发，这对国家对个人都是有好处的。
    怎样才能提高现有地质人员的本领呢？这就是必须下定决心努力学习。学习的方法有三种：
    一、经常总结经验教训。要从成功的经验中学习，特别要从失败的经验中学习。这是使我们减少错误的良好办法。每一个人做事不可能不犯错误。有一种人，犯了错误只是觉得不好意思；另一种人，却把失败当作成功之母，从失败中吸取经验教训。后一种态度，显然是正确的。地质部每年可以召开二、三次这样的会议，有准备地总结经验教训。此外在每一工地上、每一工作岗位上也应该这样作。
    要从错误中学习就必须克服一种倾向，就是掩盖错误的倾向。这种倾向在技术界中是存在的，在我们共产党员中也有这样的人。这种行为是不好的，对工作对自己都没有好处。如果想掩盖错误，越怕丢脸就越会丢脸。相反，如果承认错误，承认本领不行，则将来就很可能不丢脸。我们的本领不高，毫不奇怪，是符合于过去中国的情况的。我们能认识这一点，然后从这一点上前进，就会得到进步。
    二、向左右之间，上下之间学习，也就是向同行学习，向上级和下级学习，特别是向下级学习。我们应该形成一种开会讨论、随时商量的风气。提出方案，不怕对方指摘，因为只有互相讨论，才能使方案更加合理，使工作前进一步。现在，这种互相讨论的空气是很稀薄的，而向下级学习的空气更稀薄。这种现象应该有所改变。
    三、向苏联经验学习。苏联的经验，综合了世界上技术的最高成果，并加以提高和完整化了。我们接受苏联经验，也就是接受世界上最先进的经验。有人说，我们自己也有很高的文化，有在历史上很有地位的科学发明，这当然是不能否认的。但是这些成就，如同锁在仓库里的东西一样，不会因为向苏联学习就丢掉的。现在我们应该首先学习我们所没有的东西。
    要学习，就要丢掉包袱。我们要面向现实，采取老老实实的态度。我们有充分的信心，只要好好学习，地质界将来一定能产生出杰出的人才。
    我们的行政人员，要抓紧一切机会，帮助技术人员提高。过去，行政人员的工作是有缺点的：一方面是对技术人员的工作错误缺点不加批判，结果对事对人都不好；一方面是对技术人员工作的重要性估计不足，没有利用一切可能帮助他们学习和提高。今后应该改正这种缺点。
    我们的任务是重大的，在工作中也一定会犯一些错误。当然，在我们伟大的经济建设过程中还会碰到反革命分子的破坏，因为他们是要我们的建设失败的。我们一定要睁亮眼睛，提高警惕，不要麻痹大意。但反革命的破坏和工作中的错误是应该加以区别的，而且是可以区别的。这并不是很困难的事，我们可以根据一个人的历史、工作经历、经常的工作态度等等加以区别的。
    工作中的错误大致可分二种：一是由于粗心大意草率所造成的错误，这是不好的，犯了这种错误的人，应当小心留意，并把错误作为工作的经验教训。另外一种，就是虽然在工作中小心谨慎了，仍然可能犯错误，这在创造发明的过程中更多。对于这样的错误，我们不应灰心；对这样的人，应给以鼓励，从错误中得到经验教训，继续前进。
    我们承认明年的工作是有困难的，我们要克服困难，提高本领，增加力量，向左右上下学习，从成功和失败的经验教训中学习，向苏联学习。只要如此，困难是可以克服的。我们的责任很重大，我希望同志们努力来完成祖国所给我们的伟大任务！
