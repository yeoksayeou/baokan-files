    About Kodály
    Zhao Feng
    Chinese musicians have just bid farewell to the Hungarian musical envoys—the Hungarian National Folk Ensemble. Among their excellent performances, Kodály's works impressed us most deeply. We will never forget the wonderful chorus of "Kálla Double Dance," which runs through the unique style and rhythm of Hungarian folk songs from beginning to end. The slow movement in this chorus expresses the noble spiritual quality of the people—love for life—through the sorrow of love. And the fast movement of this chorus expresses the spirit of bravery, boldness, and optimism with enthusiastic dance rhythms.
    On December 16, 1882, Kodály was born into a railway worker's family in Kecskemét, Hungary, and studied at the Budapest Academy of Music. In 1907, he became a teacher at the Academy of Music. During this period, he and Bartók began their great collaboration—systematically collecting, arranging, and adapting folk songs. The more than 20,000 folk songs they collected not only have scientific, documentary, and folkloric significance, but more importantly, they expounded an important aesthetic principle in musical creation—making folk songs an endless source of inspiration for musical creation.
    The folk song research of Kodály and Bartók gives Chinese musicians infinite inspiration. This valuable inspiration is: learning folk songs is not copying folk songs, but studying their regularity and essence, in order to develop and create a national musical language. Kodály and Bartók studied the unique scales of Hungarian folk songs and created a national harmonic system based on the harmonic elements contained in the melodies themselves. Studying Kodály's diverse and expressive static methods used in special Hungarian modes is of great significance to our work in creating a national harmonic system.
    More importantly, Kodály achieved a high degree of unity between national style and expressive content in his compositions. As the Soviet composer Khrennikov said, this is a "highly natural and concise style" and "purity of expression." Another Soviet composer, Shaporin, said it was an "ideal harmony of content and expression." This is the best evaluation.
    As an advocate and instigator of the bourgeois democratic revolution, Kodály's work was greatly hindered under the fascist regime. His companion Bartók died in a foreign land because of this, and the musical servants of American imperialism even attempted to slander this great patriot. Therefore, during the period when the Hungarian people were still enslaved, their works could only reflect the psychology and struggles of the oppressed people who fought for noble purposes but were repeatedly frustrated. Bartók's famous works, such as "Hungarian Peasant Songs," with their pure voices of the people, and Kodály's famous one-act opera "Háry János," with its depiction of peasant humor and optimism, enslavement and resistance, can illustrate this. After the Hungarian people were liberated, Kodály's creative life was revived, and he wrote popular narrative legends like "Kálla Double Dance," which are full of patriotic feelings and the joy of creative labor.
    The great Hungarian poet Petőfi said: "When the people win in literature, then the day when they win in politics is not far away." Kodály fought all his life to win the victory of the people in art and literature. It was not until today, when the Hungarian people are striding towards socialist construction, that he truly realized his ambition: "The time has come for the cultural heritage that the intellectuals have taken from the people and endowed with new artistic forms to be returned to the masses." The heroic deeds of the people give the elderly master new strength and new themes.

    关于柯达伊
    赵沨
    中国的音乐工作者刚刚欢送了匈牙利的音乐使节们——匈牙利国家人民文工团。在他们优秀的演出中，柯达伊的作品给我们以最深刻的印象。我们忘不了《考拉双人舞》曲的奇妙的合唱，它自始至终贯穿着匈牙利民歌专有的风格和节奏。这合唱中的慢板，借着爱情的忧伤表达了人民的高贵的精神品质——对于生活的热爱。而这合唱的快板，又用热烈的舞蹈节奏表达了勇敢、奔放、乐观的情操。
    一八八二年十二月十六日，柯达伊出生在匈牙利科斯科美特城的一个铁路职工家庭里，曾在布达佩斯音乐专科学校学习。一九○七年，他成了音乐专科学校的教师。在这个时期，他和巴尔多克开始了他们伟大的合作——系统地搜集、整理、改编民歌，他们搜集的两万多首民歌，不仅具有着科学的、文献的、民俗学的意义，更重要的是他们阐述了一个重要的音乐创作上的美学原则——使民歌作为音乐创作灵感的无尽源泉。
    柯达伊和巴尔多克的民歌研究工作，给我国的音乐工作者以无限的启示。这宝贵的启示便是：学习民歌不是抄袭民歌，而是研究它的规律性，研究它的本质，以便发展和创造民族的音乐语言。柯达伊和巴尔多克研究了匈牙利民歌特有的音阶，并且根据曲调本身所包含的和声因素，创造了民族的和声体系。研究柯达伊在特殊的匈牙利调式上运用的多式多样的、富有表现力的静止法，对于我们创造民族和声体系的工作是很有意义的。
    更重要的是柯达伊在作曲上所达到的高度的民族风格和表现内容的一致性。正如苏联作曲家赫连尼科夫说的，这是“高度的自然而简洁的风格”，以及“表现手法的纯正”。另一位苏联作曲家沙波林说这是“内容和表现手法的理想的和谐”。这正是最好的评价。
    作为一个资产阶级民主革命的主张者和策动者，柯达伊的工作在法西斯政权下受到极大的阻挠。他的同伴巴尔多克因此而客死异邦，美帝国主义者的音乐奴仆们还企图污蔑这位伟大的爱国者。所以，在匈牙利人民还被奴役着的时期，他们的作品中，只能反映那些为崇高目的而奋斗但却屡次遭受挫败的被压迫人民的心理和斗争。巴尔多克的名作如《匈牙利农民之歌》中那种纯朴的人民的声音，柯达伊的著名独幕歌剧《赛克利丰诺》中的那种农民的诙谐和乐观、奴役和反抗的生活的描绘，都可以说明这些。在匈牙利人民获得解放之后，柯达伊的创作生活又复活起来，写出了像《考拉双人舞》那样充满着爱国主义情操和创造性劳动的欢乐的人民的叙事传奇。
    伟大的匈牙利诗人彼得斐说过：“当人民在文学中获胜的时候，那末，他们在政治上获胜的日子也就不远了。”柯达伊曾经为了争取人民在文艺上的胜利而奋斗一生，直到匈牙利人民迈步走向社会主义建设的今天，他才真正实现了他的壮志：“时候到了，知识阶层从人民取来而赋以新的艺术形式的文化遗产，应该交还给人民大众了”。人民的英雄行径给年老的大师以新的力量和新的主题。
