	Heroic Volunteer Army Saves Korean Girl's Life with His Own Body
	At noon on August 5th, the weather was very sultry, without the slightest breeze. A peaceful village in northern Korea presented a temporary calm. Suddenly, more than twenty "oil carrier" American jet planes flew in from the southwest, circling at low altitude...
	Half a squad of a certain engineering unit of the Volunteer Army was stationed in this village. At this time, the comrades in the squad had already been led out to hide by the squad leader; however, the cook, Min Gensheng, was still in the house preparing lunch for the comrades.
	The enemy planes circled twice and began frantically strafing and bombing. In an instant, columns of smoke mixed with dirt shot into the sky, and shattered tiles and shrapnel flew everywhere. Min Gensheng cleverly rushed out of the house, preparing to run to a low-lying area on the right corner of the house to hide. But two bombs exploded twenty or so meters in front of him, stirring up a cloud of thick smoke and flames. It turned out that a Korean girl of about thirteen or fourteen years old, who was running in front of him, was frightened and ran back in panic. Min Gensheng watched another enemy plane dive down, and worried about the Korean girl running towards him. In this extremely urgent moment, he unhesitatingly pulled the girl into his arms and immediately pressed her to the ground, covering her with his entire body. He thought: "The Chinese and Korean people are one family. This Korean girl is like my little sister! It is my responsibility to save her."
	Boom! Boom! Two wicked bombs exploded to the left front of Min Gensheng. After a dense cloud of dirt settled, Min Gensheng regained consciousness. He found that his head and shoulders were injured, and his left arm was pierced by shrapnel. Blood flowed onto the Korean girl's body; but the girl was not injured. Min Gensheng felt happy that he had saved the life of the Korean girl.
	The enemy planes flew away. The Korean girl struggled to get up, running and crying out, "Chinese salami, Chinese salami..." Her trembling voice was full of anger and gratitude. She understood that this Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier had shed his own blood for her safety...
	Comrade Min Gensheng was sent to a nearby Korean hospital. The doctors and nurses were moved by this spirit of internationalism of sacrificing oneself to save others. Many Korean people also came to see him and told his heroic story of rescuing the Korean girl everywhere.

    英勇的志愿军用自己的身体救护了朝鲜女孩的生命
    八月五日的中午，天气十分闷热，没有一丝丝微风。在朝鲜北部某地的一个和平村庄里，呈现着暂时的平静。突然，二十多架“挑油担子”的美国喷气式飞机，从西南方向飞驶过来，在低空盘旋着……。
    在这个村庄里，留驻着志愿军工兵某部的半个班。这时，班里的同志们已经由班长带领出去隐蔽了；但炊事员闵根生却还在屋子里为同志们做午饭。
    敌机飞绕了两个回旋，开始疯狂扫射和轰炸。顷刻间，烟和泥土混成的烟柱，一股一股地冲上了天空，炸碎的瓦砾和弹片到处飞击着。闵根生机智地冲出了屋子，准备跑到屋右角的一块洼地去隐蔽。可是两颗炸弹在他前面二十多公尺的地方爆炸了，卷起一团浓烟烈火。原来正跑在他前面的一个约摸十三、四岁的朝鲜女孩子，吓得慌张地回头跑来。闵根生眼看又一架敌机接着俯冲下来了，心里为这个迎面跑来的朝鲜女孩担忧。在这万分紧急的时刻，他毫不迟疑地猛地把女孩拉到怀里，随即按到地下，以自己的整个身体遮盖住她。他想到：“中朝人民是一家。朝鲜女孩就是我的小妹妹啊！救护她，是我的责任。”
    轰！轰！两颗罪恶的炸弹在闵根生的左前方爆炸了。一阵浓密的泥土落下去以后，闵根生清醒过来。他发现自己的头部和肩部负伤了，左臂被弹片打穿。鲜血淌在朝鲜女孩的身上；但女孩却没有受伤。闵根生为自己救护了朝鲜女孩的生命而感到愉快。
    敌机飞走了。朝鲜女孩挣扎着爬起来，一面奔跑，一面哭喊：“中国撒拉米、中国撒拉米……”颤抖的声音里充满了愤怒和感激。她明白这位中国人民志愿军为了她的安全而流出了自己的鲜血……。
    闵根生同志被送到附近的一所朝鲜医院里。医生和护士们都被这种舍身救人的国际主义精神所感动。很多朝鲜人民也来看望他，并且到处述说着他抢救朝鲜小女孩的英雄故事。
