    Editor's Note: The Guizhou Provincial Judicial Reform Office conscientiously handles petition materials from the masses, providing a clear explanation for each case. This approach is particularly worthy of emulation by other regions during judicial reform. Only in this way can we encourage the masses' courage and enthusiasm to supervise the government and judicial organs, and strengthen the connection between the people's government, the people's courts, and the people. However, there are still many regions, including some that have already concluded the judicial reform movement, that have not yet fully and responsibly handled the petition materials from the masses or provided explanations to the masses. This demonstrates a lack of responsibility towards the people. The organs leading the judicial reform movement in these regions should emulate Guizhou Province's approach and quickly prioritize this work.
    The judicial reform movement in Guizhou Province and Guiyang City has received the active support of the broad masses due to the emphasis placed on it by Party and government leading cadres and the full mobilization of the masses. During the movement, the masses boldly exposed and reported issues, submitting a total of 1,581 petition materials by early November. Among these, 1,314 materials were reports against the Guizhou Provincial and Guiyang Municipal People's Courts, and 267 materials were reports against other organs and other courts. The Guizhou Provincial Judicial Reform Office attached great importance to the masses' petitions. Regardless of the size of the matter, they conducted careful investigations and research, handled them responsibly, and provided explanations for each case.
    After receiving petition materials from the masses, the Guizhou Provincial Judicial Reform Office immediately ordered the accused to conduct self-examination and introspection; at the same time, it continued to understand the situation from the petitioners. Starting on October 16th, taking advantage of the presence of responsible persons from the people's courts of various special districts and counties attending the Fourth Provincial Judicial Conference in the province, it organized this group to delve into the masses and rely on them to verify and corroborate information. By late October, the internal investigation of the provincial and municipal people's courts had shifted from a general review to a focused and in-depth examination, and the self-examinations of most cadres had concluded. At this point, 69 cadres who had completed their self-examinations were selected and divided into 14 groups to continue verifying and corroborating the materials; those that had been verified and finalized were handled and explained to the masses in a timely manner. The vast majority of petition materials were handled promptly as they were verified. By mid-November, except for the 267 petition materials against other organs, which had been promptly transferred to the relevant organs for handling, the remaining 1,300-plus materials had been carefully handled based on the self-examination and introspection of the accused, group discussions, verification and corroboration by the inspection groups, and the results of assessments personally overseen by leading court cadres. Among the 1,300-plus petition materials, there were 21 cases that were completely wrongly judged, and 18 of them have now been retried, with the remaining three being actively processed. The retrial of past wrongly judged cases is generally conducted publicly. The Guizhou Provincial and Guiyang Municipal People's Courts held two large-scale retrial conferences on October 17th and November 17th, respectively, with more than 2,000 people attending each; at the same time, many small-scale retrial conferences were held at the street level. At the retrial conferences, in addition to announcing the corrected judgments, the victims or petitioners stated their opinions, the relevant judicial personnel from the court who had wrongly judged the cases made public self-criticisms, and the responsible persons of the court also made public self-criticisms. Among the petition materials, there were 45 cases involving partial misjudgments. Of these, 19 cases have been publicly retried in the courts or streets, depending on the circumstances, and the original judgments have been supplemented and corrected. The remaining cases, because some issues are still pending verification, have been treated as new cases by the provincial and municipal people's courts and are being handled in conjunction with the work of clearing backlog cases. Among the petition materials, there were 95 cases involving poor work style and illegal infringement of the interests of the masses by court trial personnel. All of these have been handled, with the judicial personnel who made mistakes making apologies to the parties concerned in person, or writing letters of repentance, or making public self-criticisms in the newspapers. Among the petition materials, there were 718 cases where, due to a lack of understanding of policies and laws, the judgments were mistakenly considered unfair. The vast majority of these were resolved by cadres from the inspection group providing detailed explanations of policies and analyzing the cases to the petitioners while verifying and corroborating the materials, clarifying their thinking. The cases were considered resolved after the original petitioners signed the petition materials to indicate that they had no further objections. There were still 82 cases that could not be resolved after explanation, so the provincial and municipal people's courts held座谈会 for the original petitioners, where Ye Gulin, Vice President of the Provincial People's Court, and Lin Chao, President of the Municipal People's Court, personally and repeatedly explained the policies in detail, conducted persuasive education, and corrected some petitioners' incorrect understandings, resolving 58 cases on the spot. The remaining 24 cases are still being explained through the masses, using various methods. Among the petition materials, there were 359 cases involving requests for judgment or enforcement. Most of these were cases that had not been promptly judged or enforced due to the procrastinating work style of the court trial personnel, such as accepting cases without handling them, handling them without concluding them, or concluding them without enforcing them. The 341 cases that could be handled immediately were handled. Another portion, due to other objective reasons, could not be concluded in a short time, and explanations have been given to the original petitioners. Among the petition materials, there were 72 cases that were complex or could not be verified and finalized in a short period of time because the parties concerned were not in Guiyang City. Explanations have been given to the petitioners in writing, stating the reasons, and these cases have been treated as new cases by the provincial and municipal people's courts in conjunction with the work of clearing backlog cases, with cadres specifically assigned to continue handling them. Among the petition materials, there were two cases involving the submission of constructive opinions to the court. One of these was considered feasible after research by the court, and the person who made the suggestion was thanked and asked to continue to provide suggestions to help the people's court improve its work; the other case is also under study. In addition, among the petition materials, there were two cases of false accusations taking advantage of loopholes. These were resolved by conducting persuasive education to the original petitioners and jointly analyzing and discussing them with the masses to clarify the right and wrong.
    Through such conscientious and responsible handling, the masses were very satisfied. As a result, the prestige of the people's government among the masses has been further enhanced, and the connection between the people's courts and the people has been strengthened.

    贵州司法改革办公室严肃处理群众检举材料
    编者按：贵州省司法改革办公室认真处理群众中来的检举材料，件件都作了明确的交代，这种作法是各地在司法改革中特别应当学习的。只有这样，才能鼓舞群众监督政权和司法机关的勇气和热情，加强人民政府、人民法院和人民群众的联系。但是目前仍有不少地区，包括若干已经结束了司法改革运动的地区，对群众检举的材料还没有完全认真负责地进行处理，向群众作出交代，这是对人民不够负责的表现。这些地区的领导司法改革运动的机关应仿效贵州省的作法，迅速把这一项工作重视起来。
    贵州省和贵阳市的司法改革运动，由于党政领导干部重视和充分发动了群众，因而得到广大群众的积极支持。在运动中，群众大胆揭发检举，到十一月上旬止，共提出了一千五百八十一件检举材料。其中检举贵州省和贵阳市人民法院的材料有一千三百十四件；检举其他机关和其他法院的材料有二百六十七件。贵州省司法改革办公室对群众的检举十分重视。不问事情大小，都慎重地进行了调查研究，作了处理，件件都有交代。
    贵州省司法改革办公室收到群众检举材料后，即一面令被检举人进行检查反省；一面继续向检举人了解情况。十月十六日起，又趁各专区和各县人民法院负责人到省参加第四届全省司法会议之便，组织了这部分力量，深入群众并依靠群众进行查实对证工作。到十月下旬，省、市人民法院的内部由普遍检查转入重点深入检查阶段，大部分干部的检查已告结束。这时即抽调了六十九个已检查完毕的干部，分成十四个小组，继续查实对证材料；对已查实定案的即同时进行处理，及时向群众交代。绝大多数检举材料，都是一面查对确实，一面就及时作了处理。到十一月中旬，除群众检举其他机关的材料二百六十七件已及时移送各有关机关处理外，对其余一千三百多件材料，都根据被检举人的检查反省和小组讨论，检查小组的查实对证，以及法院领导干部亲自掌握评定的结果，慎重地进行了处理。在一千三百多件检举材料中，属于完全判错的案件有二十一件，现已改判了十八件，其余三件也在积极处理中。改判过去错判的案件，一般都是公开进行的，贵州省和贵阳市人民法院在十月十七日和十一月十七日曾先后召开两次有两千多人参加的大规模改判大会；同时召开了以街道为单位的小型改判会多次。在改判会上，除宣布改正的判决外，并由受害人或检举人申诉意见，法院原错判案件的有关司法人员当众检讨认错，法院负责人也当众检讨。在检举材料中，属于部分错判的案件有四十五件。其中十九件已分别情况在法院或街道中进行了公开改判，对原判决作了补充和修正。其余案件因部分问题尚待查实，已由省、市人民法院作为新案，结合清理积案工作进行处理。在检举材料中，属于法院审判人员作风恶劣、非法侵害群众利益的有九十五件，已全部处理完毕，均由犯错误的审判人员向当事人当面悔过，或写出悔过书，或在报纸上公开作了检讨。在检举材料中，属于因不了解政策法令，误认判决不公的有七百十八件。其中绝大部分都由检查小组的干部在查实对证材料时，向检举人详细讲解政策，分析案情，打通思想，经原检举人在检举材料上签名，表明没有意见后，得到了解决。经过解释而仍不能解决的尚有八十二件，则经省、市人民法院召开原检举人座谈会，由省人民法院副院长叶谷霖、市人民法院院长林超亲自在会上反复详细讲解政策，进行说服教育，纠正了某些检举人不正确的认识，当场又圆满解决了五十八件。对其余的二十四件，仍继续通过群众，使用各种方法进行解释中。在检举材料中属于催判决、催执行的有三百五十九件。其中大部分是由于法院审判人员收案不办，办而不结，结案而不执行等拖拉作风，当时未能迅速判决和迅速执行的案件。对其中能够立即处理的三百四十一件案件，已进行了处理。另一部分因有其他客观原因，一时不能结案的，也已分别向原检举人作了解释。在检举材料中，属于案情复杂或因当事人不在贵阳市，短期内无法查实定案的有七十二件，已经全部用书面向检举人解释，说明理由，并作为新案，由省、市两人民法院结合清理积案工作，指定干部专门负责继续处理。在检举材料中，属于向法院提出建设性意见的有两件。其中一件经法院研究后认为可行，已回复提意见人表示感谢，并请其继续提出意见帮助人民法院改进工作；另一件也正在研究中。此外，在检举的材料中，有两件是乘机钻空子诬告的，已分别向原检举人进行说服教育及和群众共同分析讨论，明确是非后，加以解决。
    经过这样认真负责的处理，群众非常满意。因此更提高了人民政府在群众中的威信，加强了人民法院和人民群众的联系。
