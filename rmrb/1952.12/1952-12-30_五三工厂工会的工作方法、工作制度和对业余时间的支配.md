The Working Methods, Work System, and Use of Leisure Time of the No. 53 Factory Trade Union
Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Dong Xin

First, Working Methods

(1) Before starting any work, trade union cadres first conduct ideological investigation under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Cadres first study documents and instructions and resolutions from higher levels, and correct ideological deviations and errors according to the spirit of the documents. Then they begin to train administrative and trade union group leaders, setting aside one or two hours for the trade union chairman to explain the political and economic significance of each central task, specifically analyze the situation in the workshop, point out the key problems in the workshop, and the specific methods for solving these problems. In addition, methods such as family visits and individual conversations are used, and the ideological situation of the masses is understood through various organizational systems, analyzed, and categorized, and efforts are concentrated on first resolving the main ideological obstacles at present. For example, when promoting advanced experience, the study of advanced experience by the masses is checked through various systems, and it is found that the masses have various incorrect understandings of learning advanced experience. The trade union conducts criticism and education targeting these thoughts, and uses reports from advanced figures to inspire the masses' consciousness, in order to raise everyone's awareness.

(2) Grasp the key. For each stage of work, in addition to general requirements, it is necessary to put forward the key of the factory, find out the key of the workshop and the key of the group. Only by solving these key problems can the plan be completed. For example, in the first quarter of 1951, the factory increased by 60 percent new workers, the quality decreased by 20 percent, and there were many rejects. This was the key at that time. The factory then concentrated its efforts on solving the problem of new workers, widely signed master-apprentice contracts, improved the skills of new workers, mobilized old workers to take the initiative to unite with new workers, and took care of new workers in their lives to stabilize the mood of new workers. As a result, new workers quickly mastered the technology and reversed the downward trend in quality.

(3) Typical demonstration. This working method was widely used in every movement and every task. Every task starts with pilot projects, takes out "samples," and uses the advanced experience and advanced thinking of advanced figures or advanced units to educate cadres and educate the masses. Any work adopts the working method of breaking through one point, gaining experience, and promoting overall work. For example, when formulating this year's production increase and economy plan, some cadres had complacent and conservative ideas about finding tricks and tapping potential. Old workers had serious ideas of sticking to conventions, empiricism, and keeping a hand, and were unwilling to learn from other people's advanced experience. For example, a worker in the Second Workshop often produced rejects, but he did not learn from Zhang Xihe's advanced experience of not producing rejects, thinking that learning from others was "shameful." Therefore, before the promotion of the advanced experience movement, pilot projects were first carried out in the workshop. As a result, raw materials were saved (saving 500 tons of grain worth of raw materials each month), the labor organization was changed, a process was merged, and 19 people were saved. The speed of 52 machines was accelerated. The utilization rate of machinery and equipment was increased by 6.5 percent. This fact powerfully educated the masses. As a result, 41 tricks and rationalization proposals emerged in one week at the end of April, turning the production increase and economy plan of the Second Workshop into the most advanced plan in the entire factory.

(4) Combination of collective leadership and specialized division of labor: All major issues are discussed and decided by the grassroots committee. For example, in October, the Executive Committee discussed the issue of trade union re-election, the issue of wage adjustment, and the issue of amending the childcare regulations. The Standing Committee of the Grassroots Committee meets three times a week (that is, the Standing Committee meeting) to discuss problems that arise in the work and the reflections of the masses. Before the meeting, special personnel are responsible for preparing materials. For example, regarding labor insurance work, the labor insurance committee member reports to the Standing Committee member, with situations, analysis, and preliminary opinions on solving the problem, and then the general meeting discusses and decides. In this way, the sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm of each committee member is strengthened, and cadres are also cultivated. Trade union committee members are assigned to represent the factory committee in leading the overall work of each workshop, stipulating that they do departmental business work in the first half of the day and go to the workshop in the afternoon, combining departmental business work with overall work. The departmental business work takes this unit as a pilot, and draws on experience to promote overall work. Due to the use of the working method of combining points and surfaces, the work of various departments can also be carried out smoothly. The division of labor in the workshop is the same as that in the factory, thus strengthening the leadership of the workshop. In the past, the work of each department was directly led by each department. For example, the factory's cultural and educational committee member directly arranged cultural and educational work to the workshop's cultural and educational committee member, and the workshop chairman did not know, so it was difficult to grasp the work comprehensively. Sometimes everyone went to the workshop chairman, and the workshop chairman couldn't handle it. The drawbacks of direct leadership by various departments have now been corrected. The solution is that the factory trade union committee puts forward the work plan of each department, which is discussed by the factory committee, formulates a comprehensive plan, and convenes an enlarged meeting with the participation of all workshop committee members to uniformly arrange the plan. When inspecting the work of the department, problems must also be handled through the workshop chairman, thus strengthening the unified leadership of the workshop. Now, whether it is production, employee life, or ideological issues, all problems that the workshop committee can solve are solved by the workshop committee itself (reporting to the factory trade union afterwards), and problems that the workshop cannot solve are brought to the grassroots committee. The trade union group adopts the same method. The reason why the trade union organization can play a role is because there is Party leadership and administrative support in each level of organization.

Second, Various Systems

The factory trade union holds two grassroots committee meetings every month, mainly to summarize the work of the previous month and discuss the work of the next month. The Grassroots Standing Committee holds a coordination meeting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Content: Monday to study labor insurance issues, Wednesday to study production issues, and Friday to study cultural and educational issues. In this way, the chairman grasps the overall situation, takes the initiative in the work, and the connection between the committee members is also strengthened, and the weekly work of each work committee is also clearer, overcoming the chaotic, passive, and procrastinating phenomena in the work.

The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League hold a "coordination meeting" once a day at 1:00 p.m. If the problems reflected in the trade union standing committee "coordination meeting" cannot be solved by the trade union alone, the trade union chairman will bring it to this "coordination meeting" to study and seek consistent opinions and solutions.

The workshop committee meets once a week, mainly to study the work of the next week and some specific problems.

The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League hold a "coordination meeting" in the workshop every day from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The main purpose is to study the work situation of the previous day and, according to the instructions of the superiors, decide on the work for the day and carry it out according to the organizational systems of each.

The group "coordination meeting" is attended by the administrative, trade union, Party, and Communist Youth League group leaders (active members are absorbed to participate in groups without Party members and Youth League members), mainly to study the situation of the previous day and determine the work and methods for the day.

Representative meetings: (1) The employee representative meeting is held once a quarter, and the content is the administrative report on production and the signing of collective contracts, and the trade union mobilizes for competitions. (2) The general meeting of all member representatives is held once a quarter, mainly for the trade union to report to the members on the work of the quarter and announce the expenditure of trade union funds.

(3) Labor model representative meetings are held irregularly.

Diary system—The workshop chairman and the trade union group leader each have a diary. The group diary is handed over to the workshop chairman. The main content of the diary is the production situation of the day and the existing problems, as well as the requirements and opinions of the workers. The workshop diary is handed over to the factory trade union. The content is the same as that of the group. The purpose of establishing the diary is to reduce the cadre's meeting reports, etc., and at the same time, it can also grasp the overall situation in a timely manner.

The inspection system is divided into two types: (1) Regular inspection system, such as the group's patriotic pact is inspected once a week (also the organizational life of the trade union group), the grassroots committee is responsible for leading the inspection of the patriotic pact and contact contract once every half a month (the focus is the same); the implementation of the collective contract is inspected once a month. (2) Irregular inspections, the method is that grassroots cadres go to the workshop to randomly check group covenants, contact contracts, etc. The purpose is to understand and help solve problems.

The establishment of these systems is gradually established according to the development and needs of the work, and is constantly improved and consolidated through inspection.

Third, Allocation of Leisure Time

Because the factory's Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League have a clear overall view and are concerned about the political, cultural, and technical learning of the employees and the physical health of the employees, they can start from the whole and the Party Committee can uniformly allocate the employees' spare time activities. The specific arrangements are as follows:

(1) All employees of the factory must participate in learning every day from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday is for checking the group covenants (ie, trade union group meetings), Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are for implementing the current movement, and Friday and Saturday are for political education.

(2) Allocation of employees' spare time collective activities (6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.): Cultural learning is a total of six hours per week, and the production workers of the two shifts study together, and it is allocated to be carried out on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, each time one and a half hours.

In addition, the leaders and cadres of the factory and workshops, during the collective activities time of all employees, in order to lead and organize the learning and activities of all employees, cannot carry out collective learning themselves, and need to set aside one hour during working hours (8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. every morning) for collective learning.

Because the factory reasonably allocates time, the work will not fall into chaos and entanglement. All kinds of work can be carried out step by step.

    五三工厂工会的工作方法、工作制度和对业余时间的支配
    中华全国总工会政策研究室副主任　董昕
    第一、工作方法
    （一）在任何工作开始之前，工会干部首先在党委的统一领导下，进行思想调查。干部先学习文件和上级指示决议，根据文件的精神纠正思想偏向与错误。然后着手训练行政与工会组长，抽出一、二小时由工会主席讲每件中心工作的政治的与经济的意义，具体分析车间的情况，指出本车间的关键问题，及如何解决这些问题的具体办法。此外，运用家庭访问，个别谈话等方法，并通过各种组织系统，了解群众思想情况，加以分析，分别类型，集中力量，首先解决当前主要思想障碍。例如，在推广先进经验时，通过各系统检查群众学习先进经验的情况，发现群众对学习先进经验有各种不正确的认识。工会针对这些思想进行批判教育，并用先进人物的报告，来启发群众的自觉性，以提高每个人的觉悟。
    （二）抓关键。每一段工作，除了一般的要求外，必须提出厂的关键，找出车间的关键和小组的关键。只有解决了这些关键问题，计划才能完成。如一九五一年第一季该厂增加百分之六十的新工人，质量降低百分之二十，废品很多。这是当时的关键。该厂于是集中力量解决新工人问题，广泛订立师徒合同，提高新工人的技术，发动老工人主动团结新工人，给新工人生活上以照顾，安定新工人的情绪。结果，新工人迅速掌握了技术，扭转了质量下降的趋势。
    （三）典型示范。在每一个运动和每一件工作中，都广泛地采用了这个工作方法。每一件工作都从试点着手，拿出“样板”，用先进人物或先进单位的先进经验和先进思想来教育干部教育群众。任何工作都采取突破一点，取得经验，推动全面的工作方法。如在制订今年增产节约计划时，对于找窍门挖潜力，有些干部有自满保守思想。老工人存在着严重的墨守成规、经验主义和留一手的思想，不愿学习别人的先进经验。如二车间某工友做活老出废品，他又不学习张喜贺不出废品的先进经验，认为学习别人的做法是“丢人”。因此，在推广先进经验运动之前，先在车间试点，结果，节省了原料
    （每月节省价值五○○吨粮食），改变了劳动组织，合并了一个工序，节省了十九个人力。加快了五十二台机器的转数。提高机器设备运用率百分之六点五。这个事实有力地教育了群众。结果在四月底一周内就出现了窍门和合理化建议四十一件，把二车间的增产节约计划，变成了全厂最先进的计划。
    （四）集体领导与专职分工相结合：一切重大的问题均由基层委员会讨论决定。如十月份执行委员会讨论了工会改选问题、工资调整问题和修改托儿所条例问题等。基层委员会的常务委员会每周三次（也即常委碰头会）讨论在工作中发生而没有解决的问题和群众的反映。会前都有专人负责准备材料。如关于劳动保险工作方面的问题，由劳动保险委员向常务委员汇报，有情况，有分析，提出解决问题的初步意见，然后大会讨论决定。这样，就加强了各委员的责任感和工作的积极性，也培养了干部。工会委员分工代表厂委员会领导各车间的全面工作，规定上半天做部门业务工作，下午下车间，把部门的业务工作和全面工作结合起来。部门业务工作就以这个单位为试点，吸取经验来推动全面。由于运用点面结合的工作方法，使各部门工作也能顺利地开展。车间分工和厂相同，因而也就加强了车间的领导。过去各部门工作归各部门直接领导，如厂文教委员将文教工作直接布置给车间文教委员，车间主席不知道，工作很难全面掌握。有时大家去找车间主席，车间主席就吃不消。现在已纠正各部门直接领导的弊病。解决的办法是厂工会委员会提出各部门工作计划，经厂委员会讨论，拟定全面计划，召开扩大会议，车间全体委员参加，统一布置。检查部门工作时，有问题也要通过车间主席，这样就加强了车间的统一领导。现在各车间无论生产、职工生活和思想等问题，凡车间委员会能够解决的全由车间委员会自行解决（事后汇报厂工会），车间解决不了的问题，才提到基层委员会来。工会小组采取同样办法。工会组织所以能够发挥作用，是因为在层层组织中，有党的领导与行政的支持。
    第二、各种制度
    该厂工会每月召开两次基层委员会，主要是总结上月的工作，讨论下月的工作。基层常务委员会每星期一、三、五上午十时至十一时举行碰头会。内容：星期一研究劳动保险问题，星期三研究生产问题，星期五研究文教问题。这样主席掌握了全面情况，工作主动，委员之间也加强了联系，各个工作委员会的每周工作也较明确，克服了工作上的忙乱被动和拖拉现象。
    每日下午一时党、行政、工会、青年团开一次
    “碰头会”。工会常务委员“碰头会”上所反映出来的问题，如果单纯靠工会不能解决的话，工会主席就带到这个“碰头会”上研究，求得一致的意见与解决办法。
    车间委员会每周召开一次，主要是研究下一周的工作和一些具体问题。
    每日上午十一时至十二时车间党、行政、工会、青年团召开“碰头会”。主要是研究昨天的工作情况，并根据上级的指示，决定当天的工作，按各个组织系统分工进行。
    小组“碰头会”由行政、工会、党、青年团组长参加（没有党员团员的小组吸收积极分子参加），主要是研究昨天的情况，并确定当天的工作和办法。
    代表会议：（一）职工代表会一季一次，内容是行政报告生产情况和签订集体合同，工会动员竞赛等。（二）全体会员代表会一季一次，主要是工会向会员报告一季度工作，公布工会经费开支情况。
    （三）劳动模范代表会，不定期召开。
    日记制度—车间主席和工会小组长每人都有日记，小组日记交给车间主席，日记主要内容为当天的生产情况和存在的问题及工人的要求和意见，车间日记交给厂工会，内容和小组相同，建立日记的目的是为了减少干部的会议汇报等，同时也可以及时地掌握全面情况。
    检查制度一共分两种：（一）定期检查制度，如小组爱国公约每周检查一次（也是工会小组的组织生活），每半月由基层委员会负责领导检查爱国公约和联系合同一次（重点相同）；每月检查一次集体合同执行情况。（二）不定期检查，办法是基层干部下车间，随时随地抽查小组公约、联系合同等。其目的是为了解和帮助解决问题。
    这些制度的建立，是根据工作的发展和需要逐渐建立起来的，是经过检查，不断改进与巩固起来的。
    第三、业余时间分配
    该厂党、行政、工会、青年团由于具有明确的全面观点，都关心职工群众的政治、文化、技术学习和职工的身体健康，所以能从整体出发，由党委统一分配职工业余活动时间。具体安排如下：
    （一）全厂职工每日下午五时至六时必须参加学习。星期一检查小组公约（即工会小组会）星期二、三、四是贯彻当前运动，星期五、六政治教育。
    （二）职工业余集体活动时间（六时半至八时）的分配：文化学习每周共六小时，两班的生产工人统
    一学习，分配在星期一、二、三、四进行，每次一小时半。
    此外，厂部与车间的领导干部，在全体职工的集体活动时间，为了领导与组织全体职工的学习与活动，其本身不能进行集体学习，需要在工作时间抽出一小时（每日早晨八时至九时）集体学习。
    由于该厂合理支配时间，使得工作不致陷于忙乱，互相牵扯。各种工作都能够按部就班地进行。
