Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th—On December 10th, the U.S. side killed one of our captured personnel and injured four others at the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. On December 11th, the U.S. side injured two more of our captured personnel at the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the other side on December 15th regarding these consecutive incidents of murdering our captured personnel, pointing out that the U.S. side cannot escape full responsibility for these bloody war crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th—According to an announcement by the U.S. side, another prisoner of war was beaten to death and six prisoners of war were injured at the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Koje Island.

According to the Associated Press, the U.S. side beat a prisoner of war to death at midnight on December 10th, accusing him of "constantly running from one barracks to another" and "attempting to convene a secret meeting of prisoners of war in the camp's kitchen." The "crime" fabricated by the U.S. side is extremely absurd and ridiculous, but it proves the fact that the U.S. side is continuing to massacre our captured personnel who are firmly demanding repatriation to their motherland.

The incidents of injuring prisoners of war all occurred in the Zhou Guli (transliteration) prisoner-of-war camp on Koje Island. Four of the prisoners of war were reportedly injured for "beating" an "unarmed" U.S. soldier. The other two were reportedly injured for "attacking the deputy commander of the Zhou Guli enclosure." The U.S. side did not dare to explain why the prisoners of war were risking their lives to resist these executioners who have been persecuting them for years. However, from these two coincidental events, people can clearly see through the fact that the U.S. side is still carrying out the conspiracy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war in their prisoner-of-war camps, and the prisoners of war would rather die than accept the fate of being enslaved.

### 南日将军抗议美方又连续虐杀我被俘人员

    南日将军抗议美方又连续虐杀我被俘人员
    【新华社开城十五日电】十二月十日美方在巨济岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员一名，打伤我方被俘人员四名。十二月十一日美方又在巨济岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员二名。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军，在十二月十五日对这连续发生的虐杀我方被俘人员的事件，向对方提出严重抗议，指出美方决不能逃脱对这种血腥的战争罪行的完全责任。
    【新华社开城十五日电】据美方宣布，在巨济岛美方战俘营中又有一名战俘被打死，六名战俘被打伤。
    据美联社报道，美方在十二月十日午夜打死战俘一名，罪名是“这个战俘不断地从一个营房跑到另一个营房”，“企图召集战俘在营场的厨房中举行秘密会议”。美方虚拟的这种“罪名”是十分荒谬可笑的，但是它却证明了一个事实，即美方正在继续屠杀坚决要求遣返祖国的我方被俘人员。
    打伤战俘的事件都发生在巨济岛上的周固里（译音）战俘营中。其中四名战俘据说是因为“殴打”一个“没有武装”的美军士兵而被打伤的。另外两名据说是因为“攻击周固里的围场副司令”而被打伤的。美方没有敢说明战俘们为什么要这样奋不顾身地反抗这些长年累月地迫害他们的刽子手。但是从这两起不谋而合的事件，人们已经完全可以看穿：美方仍在他们的战俘营中进行强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动，而战俘则宁死也不肯接受被奴役的命运。
