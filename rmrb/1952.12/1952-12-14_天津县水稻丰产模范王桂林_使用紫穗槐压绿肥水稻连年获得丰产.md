Tianjin County Rice Production Model Worker Wang Guilin
Achieves Continuous High Yields of Rice by Using Amorpha Fruticosa as Green Manure

The Xinli Village area of Tianjin County, Hebei Province, is a well-known rice-producing area in North China. All the land in Xinli Village belongs to the state and is entirely irrigated by electric pumps. The village has 6,137 mu of paddy fields and 176 mu of dry land, with 317 households, of which 310 have been organized. During the period of Japanese occupation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, local farmers used only soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers, and did not pay much attention to manure accumulation and the application of organic fertilizers. Currently, many farmers still only use soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers, resulting in high production costs. Farmer Wang Guilin has a different view. He believes that using only soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers cannot nourish the soil. He pays close attention to manure accumulation, getting up early and working late to collect manure during the slack farming season. In the winter of 1949, he accumulated ten large cartloads of manure, so his rice grew better and yielded more than others. He was commended by the Bohai District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau and was called a manure accumulation model. In 1950, he was selected as a rice production model worker.

Wang Guilin likes to study agricultural production. At a conference of the Bohai District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau in 1950, it was mentioned that Amorpha fruticosa had high fertilizer efficiency and could be used as green manure. He remembered this and, after returning home, cut off some Amorpha fruticosa branches from his field and conducted experiments. However, because his land had already been fertilized with soybean cakes, the addition of Amorpha fruticosa was too strong, resulting in excessive growth of the crops. But he was not discouraged and continued to experiment. In 1951, he used 800 jin of semi-dry Amorpha fruticosa branches and leaves (equivalent to 1,600 jin of fresh branches and leaves) and 16 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu in 1.6 mu of paddy field, and harvested 1,302 jin of rice per mu. This was an unexpected bumper harvest. On the same piece of land, using 1,800 jin of manure mixed with soil (equivalent to the fertilizer effect of 250 jin of soybean cakes) and 25 jin of ammonium sulfate, the yield was only 1,225 jin of rice per mu. This year, he again used 1,100 jin of fresh Amorpha fruticosa branches and leaves and 25 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu. Although there were disasters this year such as saltwater, frost, hail, and wind, which greatly affected rice, his rice field still yielded 1,125 jin per mu, which was 75 jin higher than the yield of the rice fields in his group that used only 300 jin of soybean cakes and 25 jin of ammonium sulfate. Under his guidance, Liu Baoxi in the neighboring village used only 550 jin of semi-dry Amorpha fruticosa on one mu of wheat stubble corn and harvested 375 jin of corn.

Wang Guilin's method of applying Amorpha fruticosa is to cut the cut Amorpha fruticosa green branches into short sections about one inch long with a straw cutter, pour on an appropriate amount of water, cover with a mat, ferment for four or five days until they turn dark green, and then move them to the field as top dressing, and immediately carry out a cultivation. He said: Because the seedlings have already been transplanted when the branches are cut, it can only be used as top dressing. If the Amorpha fruticosa from the previous year can be stored and used as base fertilizer in the coming year, the effect will be better. Wang Guilin has the following experiences regarding the application of Amorpha fruticosa:

1. Using Amorpha fruticosa as green manure can increase soil organic matter and improve the soil. In this area, due to the continuous and separate application of soybean cakes and ammonium sulfate for many years, the soil is very deficient in organic matter, resulting in soil compaction and difficulty in turning. In such soil, fertilizers cannot fully exert their effectiveness, so the amount of fertilizer applied must be increased year by year. Wang Guilin said: In the paddy fields that have used Amorpha fruticosa or horse manure, there is no such problem, the soil is loose and easy to turn. He gave another practical example: This summer, due to a period of drought, the river water level dropped, forming seawater backflow; because seawater contains salt, it could not be pumped for irrigation. At that time, the rice fields that only used soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers suffered disasters due to drought and rising underground salinity, and the rice seedlings grew short and withered. However, the paddy fields that had used a large amount of organic fertilizers such as Amorpha fruticosa, horse manure, and manure remained unaffected, and the plants were about a foot taller in comparison. This fully proves that Amorpha fruticosa has a great effect on soil improvement and increased production.

2. Using Amorpha fruticosa as green manure can reduce costs. In this area, the fertilizers used for rice are almost entirely purchased, resulting in high production investment. According to a survey in Xinli Village, the cost of soybean cakes, manure, and chemical fertilizers applied per mu is about 300,000 yuan, plus irrigation water fees and other expenses, it costs about 500,000 yuan per mu. Some farmers can produce 1,000 jin of rice per mu, but after deducting the investment and paying public grain, they still need the government to provide fertilizer loans next year. Using Amorpha fruticosa as fertilizer can greatly reduce costs. Wang Guilin calculated that he saved 250 jin of soybean cakes per mu in the rice fields where he used Amorpha fruticosa last year, and saved another 300 jin of soybean cakes this year.

3. Amorpha fruticosa green manure is a complete fertilizer. Amorpha fruticosa contains the three fertilizer elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Rice that has been fertilized with Amorpha fruticosa grows more luxuriantly than usual, develops evenly and robustly, and does not experience lodging or withering; the maturity period is also four or five days earlier than that of rice that uses only soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers, and the grains are full. In this area, due to the continuous application of soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers for many years, without paying attention to the combined use of various fertilizers, the development of rice is not very normal, and the grains have gradually become smaller. This year, each jin of rice has more than 21,000 grains. The same variety, but fertilized with Amorpha fruticosa, horse manure, and manure, has larger grains, with about 19,000 grains per jin.

    天津县水稻丰产模范王桂林
    使用紫穗槐压绿肥水稻连年获得丰产
    河北省天津县新立村一带是华北著名的水稻产区。新立村全村的土地是属于国家所有的，并且全部使用电力扬水灌溉。全村有水地六千一百三十七亩，旱地一百七十六亩，农户有三百一十七户，其中三百一十户已经组织起来。在日寇及国民党反动统治时期，当地农民一直单用豆饼及化学肥料，对于积肥和施用有机质肥料不大重视。目前许多农民仍是只施用豆饼及化学肥料，因此生产成本很大。农民王桂林的看法和大家不同，他认为单用豆饼和化学肥料不能养地。他很注意积肥，在农闲的时候，每天起早贪晚攒粪。一九四九年一个冬天，就积了十大车粪，因此他的水稻比别人长得好，打得多。他曾受到渤海区农垦管理局的表扬，被称为积肥模范。一九五○年，他被选为水稻丰产模范。
    王桂林在农业生产上很喜欢钻研。一九五○年渤海区农垦管理局开会时，曾提到紫穗槐含肥效很高，可以压绿肥。他听了就记在心里，回家后把他地头上的几墩紫穗槐枝条割下来做了试验。可是，因为他的地上原先已经施用过豆饼，再上紫穗槐，劲头太大，结果庄稼长疯了。但他并不灰心，继续做试验。一九五一年，他在一亩六分水稻田里每亩用了八百斤半干的紫穗槐枝叶（合一千六百斤青枝叶）和十六斤硫酸铵，每亩收了稻谷一千三百零二斤。这是他没有想到的丰收。在同样的一片土地上，施用了一千八百斤掺土的粪干（相当于二百五十斤豆饼的肥效）和二十五斤硫酸铵，每亩不过产稻谷一千二百二十五斤。今年，他又照样每亩施用了一千一百斤青的紫穗槐枝叶和二十五斤硫酸铵。今年虽然闹了咸水、霜、雹、风灾，对稻谷影响很大，但他的稻田每亩还收了一千一百二十五斤，比他组里单用三百斤豆饼和二十五斤硫酸铵的稻田的产量还要高出七十五斤。邻村的刘宝喜在他的指导下，一亩麦茬玉米只用了五百五十斤半干的紫穗槐，收了三百七十五斤玉米。
    王桂林施用紫穗槐的方法，是把割下来的紫穗槐青枝条，用铡刀切成长一寸左右的短节，浇上适量的水分，盖上席，发酵四、五天，变成黑绿色，然后搬到田里做追肥，并且立刻进行一次中耕。他说：因为在割条时，已经插过秧了，所以只能做追肥。如果能把头一年的紫穗槐储藏起来，等到来年做基肥用，效果会更好。王桂林对于施用紫穗槐有以下几点体验：
    一、用紫穗槐压绿肥可以增加土壤有机质，改良土壤。在这一带，稻田由于连年陆续单独施用豆饼和硫酸铵，土壤中有机质非常缺乏，因而土壤胶结，不容易翻动。在这样的土壤里，肥料也不能充分发挥效能，因此施肥量必须逐年增加。王桂林说：在用过紫穗槐或马粪的稻田里，就没有这个问题，土壤松软，翻动很容易。他又举了一个实际的例子：今年夏天，因一度天旱，河流水位降低，形成了海水倒灌；因为海水含盐，不能扬水灌溉。那时，单用豆饼和化学肥料的稻田，因干旱及地下盐分上升受到了灾害，稻秧生长得矮小而枯黄。但是，曾经用过紫穗槐和马粪、粪干等大量有机肥料的稻田，都没有受到影响，植株比较起来要高出一尺。这就可以充分证明紫穗槐对土壤改良和增产有很大的作用。
    二、用紫穗槐压绿肥可以减低成本。在这一带，水稻所用的肥料几乎完全依靠购买，因而生产投资很大。据在新立村调查，每亩施用的豆饼、粪干、化学肥料折价约达三十万元左右，连同灌溉水费及其他费用，每亩约需五十万元左右。有的农民虽然每亩产到一千斤稻谷，但去了投资，缴了公粮，明年还得要政府贷给肥料。用紫穗槐做肥料，成本就可以大大降低。王桂林算了一下账，他去年使用紫穗槐的稻田，每亩省了二百五十斤豆饼，今年又省了三百斤豆饼。
    三、紫穗槐绿肥是一种完全的肥料。紫穗槐是含有氮、磷、钾三种肥料要素的东西。用过紫穗槐的水稻，生长得比一般的茂盛，发育很均衡而且健壮，没有倒伏或枯萎现象；成熟期也比单用豆饼和化学肥料的提前四、五天，而且籽实饱满。在这一带，因连年施用豆饼及化学肥料，不注意各种肥料配合使用，稻谷发育不很正常，籽实已有逐渐减小的趋势，今年每斤稻谷已达两万一千多粒。相同的品种，但施用紫穗槐、马粪、粪干等肥料的，籽粒就比较大，每斤约合一万九千多粒。
