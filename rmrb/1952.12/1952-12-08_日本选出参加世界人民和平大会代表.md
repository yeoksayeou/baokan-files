    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社讯：东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会和日本工会总评议会、民主主义科学者协会、日本农民协会、全日学生自治会总联合会、妇女民主俱乐部等团体，都收到世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的邀请，邀请日本派遣代表参加世界人民和平大会。日本拥护和平委员会现已选出五十个代表参加世界人民和平大会，代表中包括律师、著名进步领袖布施辰治、参议员远山平一和其他各民主团体的代表，布施辰治被选为代表团团长。
    日本政府害怕日本和平运动的高涨，正企图阻挠日本代表出席世界人民和平大会。据共同社消息：日本外务省出入国管理厅长官松尾高雄宣布，日本政府可能不发护照给参加世界人民和平大会的日本代表。另据日本广播说，法务相已命令警察监视日本代表们，使他们不能到维也纳去。
