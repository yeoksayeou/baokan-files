    Central Higher Education Ministry Leads Higher Education Institutions and Relevant Agencies in Translating Soviet Higher Education Textbooks

    Following the restructuring of departments and the determination of specializations in national higher education institutions, there is an urgent need to adopt a large number of Soviet textbooks in order to effectively reform teaching content and gradually improve teaching quality. The Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education is uniformly organizing and leading talent with professional foundations and Russian translation skills from higher education institutions and relevant agencies across the country to carry out translation work, and some textbooks have already been published.

    Currently, the translated and published Soviet higher education textbooks include: Academician Smirnov's famous "Course of Higher Mathematics," Volume 1, Parts 1 and 2, which won the Stalin Prize, and more than ten kinds of books in the "Higher Education Series" edited by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northeast People's Government, including "General Physics" Volume 1 co-authored by Foulis and Timoreva, and "General Chemistry" Volume 1 by Glinka. These textbooks have been universally adopted by higher education institutions across the country and are welcomed by the majority of teachers and students.

    According to preliminary statistics from survey materials in June of this year, there are approximately more than 600 teachers and staff in national higher education institutions with Russian translation skills. In addition, during the summer vacation and after the start of the fall semester, many school teachers actively studied Russian, especially those who participated in intensive professional Russian book reading courses. After a short period of intensive study, they have initially acquired the ability to read and translate professional Russian books. However, the existing translation force still cannot meet actual needs. Due to limitations of data and time, the Ministry of Higher Education will focus on organizing the translation of textbooks for basic courses in the first and second grades of Soviet higher education institutions from 1952 to 1953, while also taking into account some urgently needed textbooks for higher-level professional courses. The scope will then be gradually expanded to complete the translation of textbooks for all major disciplines. Currently, the translation of more than 300 kinds of Soviet higher education textbooks has begun, of which science and engineering textbooks account for about two-thirds, and the rest are textbooks for agriculture, forestry, teacher training, and liberal arts. Textbooks in political science, law, and finance are currently mainly solved by the Renmin University of China; medical and health textbooks are the responsibility of the Health Textbook Compilation and Review Committee of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Health. There are currently more than 30 kinds of translated versions of Soviet textbooks that have been printed or are about to be printed. It is expected that a large number of Soviet textbooks will be published throughout next year.

    In order to ensure the quality of translation work, the Ministry of Higher Education requires that collective strength be fully utilized when organizing the translation of Soviet textbooks: for translators with stronger abilities, the method of "co-translation and mutual proofreading" is advocated; for translators with weaker abilities, they are required to adopt the method of "individual reading, joint discussion, dedicated writing, and collective proofreading," and organize groups to carry out work. At the same time, in order to avoid wasting manpower, translators must first translate a part for trial translation before formally starting translation, and submit it to the Ministry of Higher Education for review and approval before formally translating. After the entire draft is completed, it will be reviewed and approved by the Ministry, and then published under the name of "Trial Edition of Higher Education Textbooks Recommended by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education." The trial edition will be subject to mass review and revision by teachers and students in the teaching process, and then used as the final version.

    In order to widely collect Soviet textbooks, the Ministry of Higher Education collected more than 5,000 copies of various Soviet higher education textbooks from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government's General Administration of Publications, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northeast People's Government, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Beijing Library, and the International Bookstore, but most of the versions are older, and there is also a lack of textbooks for some basic courses. Therefore, the Ministry is consulting with the General Administration of Publications to solve the problem of large-scale supply of Soviet textbooks through the Soviet International Book Company, in order to carry out translation work in a more organized and planned manner.

### 中央高等教育部领导高等学校及有关机关  进行苏联高等学校教材翻译工作

    中央高等教育部领导高等学校及有关机关
    进行苏联高等学校教材翻译工作
    全国高等学校在院系调整、专业设置确定以后，迫切需要采用大量的苏联教材，以便有效地改革教学内容，逐步地提高教学质量。中央人民政府高等教育部正统一组织和领导全国高等学校及有关机关具有专业基础和俄文翻译能力的人才进行翻译工作，并已出版部分教材。
    目前已经翻译出版的苏联高等学校教材有：荣获斯大林奖金的苏联科学院院士斯米尔诺夫名著“高等数学教程”卷一第一、二分册和东北人民政府文化教育委员会主编的“高等教育丛书”中的福里斯和季莫列娃合著“普通物理学”第一卷、格琳卡著“普通化学”上册等十余种。这些教材已为全国高等学校普遍采用，受到广大教师和学生的欢迎。
    根据今年六月间调查材料的初步统计，全国高等学校中具有俄文翻译能力的教师及工作人员约有六百多人。另外，暑假期间和秋季开学以后，许多学校教师积极学习俄文，特别是参加专业俄文书籍阅读速成学习的教师，经过短期突击学习，已初步具备了阅读和翻译专业俄文书籍的能力，但现有翻译力量还不能满足实际需要。由于资料和时间的限制，高等教育部在一九五二年到一九五三年首先以组织翻译苏联高等学校一、二年级基础课程的教材为主，同时照顾到一些急迫需要的高年级专业课程教材，以后再逐步扩大范围，完成全部主要学科教材的翻译工作。现已着手翻译的苏联高等学校教材共有三百余种，其中理工科教材约占三分之二，其余为农林、师范及文史科教材。政法、财经科的教材目前主要依靠中国人民大学解决；医药卫生教材由中央人民政府卫生部卫生教材编审委员会负责解决。目前已翻译付印和即将付印的苏联教材中译本有三十余种。预计明年全年将有大批苏联教材出版。
    为了保证翻译工作的质量，高等教育部组织翻译苏联教材时，要求充分发挥集体力量：对于能力较强的翻译人员，提倡“合译互校”的办法；对于能力较弱的翻译人员，要求他们采取“个别阅读，共同讨论，专人执笔，集体校订”的办法，组织小组进行工作。同时，为了避免浪费人力，翻译人员在正式开始翻译前，须先试译一部分，送高等教育部审核批准后，再行正式翻译。译稿全部完成，经该部审查批准后，即以“中央人民政府高等教育部推荐高等学校教材试用本”的名义出版。试用本在教学过程中通过教师和学生的群众性审查和修正，然后作为定本。
    为了广泛搜集苏联教材，高等教育部曾从中共中央宣传部、中央人民政府出版总署、东北人民政府文化教育委员会、中国科学院、北京图书馆及国际书店等机关搜集了苏联高等学校各种教材五千余册，但大部分版本较旧，同时还缺乏若干基础课程教材。因此，该部正商请出版总署通过苏联国际图书公司解决苏联教材的大量供应问题，以便进一步更有组织有计划地进行翻译工作。　　　（新华社）
