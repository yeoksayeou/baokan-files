The Education and Management of New Party Members Must Be Strengthened

Since July of this year, Party organizations in various regions, based on the Central Committee's instructions on Party building, have admitted a considerable number of new Party members in rural areas. These new Party members received relatively systematic communist and Party education during the Party-building work, and most of them are working actively and enthusiastically, playing a significant role in promoting the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and other tasks, strengthening the Party's leadership over rural work, and closely linking the Party with the masses.

In order to continuously improve the political consciousness and working ability of new Party members, some local Party leading organs have established Party branches after receiving new Party members, paid attention to the education of new Party members, and organized training classes for new Party members; thus, the work enthusiasm of new Party members has been highly brought into play, and various tasks have been further developed.

However, some Party organizations have neglected the education and management of new Party members, resulting in new Party members feeling distressed due to the lack of sound organizational life and the inability to continue to improve their ideological level and work efficiency. For example, in Dishui Township, District One, Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, fifteen new Party members were admitted in mid-July of this year, but a Party member was not assigned to be the branch secretary and a temporary branch was not established until mid-September; and after the temporary branch was established, it did not hold a meeting for more than a month. Party members reflected: "Before joining the Party, people often talked to us, but after joining the Party, no one cares about us!" In Shili Township, Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, new Party members have not established branches and groups for more than two months after returning from the Party-building training class, and have not held a single Party meeting. Some Party members said: "I have joined the Party, but I don't know how to be a Party member." In some places, although branches and groups have been established, they lack leadership, organizational life is unsound, and they still cannot play the role of Party organizations. The Guantian Township Branch in Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province, has not held a meeting for four or five months, and the district committee has not inspected or urged it. In Buqian Township, Yongxin County, the Party branch was established for nearly forty days, but although the district committee secretary of the district had been to the township twice, he emphasized that "the central work is busy," did not hold a branch meeting, and did not talk to Party members.

In other places, Party organizations only assign work tasks to Party members, but do not teach them how to work; they only emphasize that Party members should play a leading role, but do not pay attention to improving them ideologically. When a Party district cadre in Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, went to the countryside to deploy work, he did not discuss it with the branch or within the Party, but simply said, "Party members should play a leading role"; therefore, some Party members did not know where to start after receiving the task. Some places inappropriately assigned too many tasks to new Party members, affecting production work. For example, Hu Chunxiang, a Party member in Chengdong District, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, did not participate in production for two months in order to complete the evaluation work of two villages assigned to him by the branch, and the better mutual aid group he originally led collapsed as a result.

The above phenomena occur mainly because the county and district Party committees do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of Party building work, and think that developing new Party members means completing the Party building task, so they do not continue to carry out education work to bring into play the role of new Party members. Secondly, some Party county and district cadres are not good at implementing the Party's policies through the branch, and are accustomed to the past all-inclusive leadership methods, emphasizing that they are busy with work and not holding Party meetings; they do not know how to bring into play the power of the branch, and do not know that the central work must be well completed through the Party's guarantee. Again, the district committee organizations in some places are not yet sound, and some places have not even established district committee organizations.

It must be pointed out that the purpose of developing the Party is to expand the Party's organization and strengthen the Party's leadership over the people and the cause of national construction. Therefore, it is completely wrong to think that completing the task of Party building means developing a certain number of Party members. We must check the results of Party building work not only from the number of Party members developed, but more importantly from the quality of Party members and whether they can play a role. Because these new Party members have received some education before joining the Party, but it is only preliminary education after all. How to continuously improve the class consciousness and working ability of new Party members is a regular task of Party organizations. Neglecting this point will not bring into play the Party's leadership role in rural areas. Therefore, strengthening the education and management of new Party members should be an important task in the current rural Party building. First, the leading ideology of the county and district Party committees must attach importance to the leadership of the branch, and clearly recognize that the rural branch is the core of leading and uniting the broad masses. The district committee must clearly divide the work and specifically lead the management and education of each rural branch, and thoroughly change the erroneous view that "we can work without Party members." When deploying the central work, the district committee should first convene a joint meeting of the branch committees or a Party member meeting to mobilize and study, make the work tasks very clear and specific, and help them formulate work plans and study methods for implementing the plans; in the process of work, it is necessary to conduct more inspections, help them solve specific problems, prevent them from being given too many and too heavy tasks, and promptly summarize the leadership experience of the branch in various tasks. Second, in places where there are already more than three new Party members, a temporary branch should be established immediately, and a temporary branch secretary and branch committee members should be designated to carry out daily work. Branches with fewer Party members do not necessarily have to divide into groups. The Party's meeting system must be sound, and attention should be paid to new Party members having strict organizational life from the beginning, launching criticism and self-criticism, and correcting shortcomings in work and ideology. Third, new Party members should be trained in a planned way. Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee stipulated that the local Party committees should run one to two training classes this year to train branch secretaries, branch committee members, group leaders, and probationary Party members who have completed their probationary period, and conduct education on the Party Constitution and branch work. Through this education, the political level and working ability of new Party members will be gradually improved. This method can be used as a reference for various places. Fourth, in places where the district committee organizations are unsound, cadres should be transferred to strengthen the district committee organizations; as for places where district committee organizations have not been established, the leading organs of the district committees should be established as soon as possible according to the actual situation.

In order to do a good job in the education and management of new Party members, the leading organs above the district committee should establish a regular inspection system for branch work, promptly understand the work and ideological situation of Party members, and focus on leading the education work of one or two branches, specifically summarizing the experience in the management and education of Party members in order to grasp typical examples and promote the overall situation.

### 必须加强对新党员的教育和管理工作

    必须加强对新党员的教育和管理工作
    今年七月以后，各地党的组织根据中央关于建党工作的指示，在农村中接收了相当数量的新党员。这些新党员曾在建党工作中受到比较系统的共产主义和共产党的教育，大都积极热情地工作着，在农村的互助合作运动和其他各项工作中发挥了很大的推动作用，加强了党对农村工作的领导，密切了党与群众的关系。
    为了不断地提高新党员的政治觉悟和工作能力，有些地方党的领导机关在接收新党员以后建立党的支部，注意了对新党员的教育，开办新党员训练班；因而高度地发挥了新党员的工作热情，使各项工作得到进一步的开展。
    但是，有些党的组织忽视了对新党员的教育和管理，致使新党员因缺乏健全的组织生活，不能继续提高思想水平和工作效率，而感到苦恼。例如四川简阳县一区滴水乡在今年七月中旬就接收了十五个新党员，直到九月中旬才指定了一个党员去作支部书记，建立了临时支部；而临时支部建立后，一个多月也没有开过会。党员反映：“没有入党以前，经常有人找我们谈话，入了党，反而没有人管了！”江西安福县十里乡新党员从建党训练班回去后，两个多月还没有建立支部和小组，没有开过一次党的会议。有的党员说：“入党了，但不知党员怎样当。”有的地方虽然建立了支部和小组，但缺乏领导，组织生活不健全，仍不能发挥党的组织作用。江西吉安县官田乡支部四、五个月没有开过一次会，区委也不检查督促。永新县埠前乡党支部成立了近四十天，该区区委书记虽曾到过该乡两次，但都强调“中心工作忙”，没有开过支部会，没有找党员谈过话。
    另有些地方的党组织，光分配党员工作任务，不教他们如何工作；光强调党员起带头作用，不注意从思想上提高他们。江西安福县有个党的区干部下乡布置工作时，不和支部研究，不在党内讨论，只简单地交代一句“党员要起带头作用”；因此，有些党员在接到任务后不知从何着手。有的地方不适当地交给新党员过多的任务，使生产工作受到影响。如江苏松江县城东区党员胡春祥，为了完成支部交给他的两个村的评比工作，两个月的时间没有参加生产，自己原来领导的一个较好的互助组，也因此垮了台。
    上述现象之所以产生，主要是由于县、区党委对建党工作的意义认识不足，以为发展了新党员就算完成了建党任务，因而不继续进行教育工作，来发挥新党员的作用。其次，某些党的县、区干部还不善于通过支部去贯彻党的政策，习惯于过去一揽子的领导方法，强调工作忙而不召开党的会议；不知道发挥支部的力量，不知道中心工作必须通过党的保证才能很好地完成。再次，有的区委机构还不健全，甚至有的地方还没有建立区委机构。
    必须指出：发展党的目的是为了扩大党的组织加强党对人民群众及国家建设事业的领导作用。因此，如果认为发展了一定数目的党员就算完成了建党任务，这是完全错误的。我们检查建党工作的成果不仅要从发展党员的数字来看，而更重要的是要从党员质量及能否发挥作用来看。因为这些新党员虽然在入党前曾受了一些教育，但毕竟是初步的教育。如何不断地提高新党员的阶级觉悟和工作能力，乃是党组织的经常任务。忽视这一点，就不能发挥党在农村的领导作用。因此，加强对新党员的教育和管理，应该是当前农村党的建设中的一个重要任务。第一、各县、区委的领导思想必须重视支部的领导，明确认识农村支部是领导和团结广大群众的核心。区委必须明确分工，具体领导各个农村支部的管理与教育工作，彻底改变认为“没有党员一样能工作”的错误看法。区委在布置中心工作时应先召开支委联席会或党员大会进行动员研究，把工作任务规定得非常明确具体，并帮助他们订立工作计划，研究贯彻执行计划的方法；在工作过程中，要多检查，帮助他们解决具体问题，防止交给他们过多过重的任务，并及时总结支部在各种工作中的领导经验。第二、在已经有三个以上的新党员的地方，应立即建立临时支部，指定临时支部书记及支部委员，进行日常工作。凡是党员较少的支部，不一定要划分小组。党的会议制度要健全，一开始就注意新党员过严格的组织生活，展开批评与自我批评，纠正工作上和思想上的缺点。第三、要有计划地培养训练新党员。最近四川省委规定：各地委在今年开办一期至二期训练班，训练支部书记、支部委员、小组长和候补期满的候补党员，进行党章及支部工作的教育，通过这个教育，逐步提高新党员的政治水平和工作能力。这个办法可供各地参考。第四、对于区委机构不健全的地方，应该抽调干部充实区委机构；至于没有建立区委机构的地方，应该按照实际情况及早建立起区委员会的领导机关。
    为了做好对新党员的教育和管理工作，区委以上的领导机关应建立经常的支部工作检查制度，及时了解党员的工作情况和思想情况，并有重点地领导
    一两个支部的教育工作，具体地总结对党员管理教育的经验以便抓住典型，推动全盘。
