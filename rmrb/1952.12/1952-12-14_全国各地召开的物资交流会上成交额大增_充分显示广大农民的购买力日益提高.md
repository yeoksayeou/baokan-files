Since autumn, various forms of material exchange meetings have been widely held across the country to welcome the peak trading season. These meetings were held on the basis of this year's agricultural bumper harvest, increased farmer purchasing power, and increased industrial products. Therefore, the transaction volume at the meetings was generally higher than in previous years, in some cases several times higher. This year's material exchange meetings in various regions showed many new characteristics: First, farmers' ability to purchase means of production has increased. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Trade Delegation ordered 50,000 walking plows at the Beijing Material Exchange Meeting alone; 450 heads of livestock were traded at the Yantai and Qingdao Material Exchange Meetings. Second, farmers demand more varieties and better quality of consumer goods. In the past, farmers and herdsmen in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region generally bought homespun cloth for clothing. This year, many people are buying fine cloth, printed cloth, and twill. Third, the general public has a great demand for cultural and sanitary products. At the North China Material Exchange Meeting held in Tianjin, order forms for notebooks, pens, pencils, ink, and certain medicines had pre-order dates scheduled until the end of this year and spring of next year. At the Beijing Material Exchange Meeting, many balls, pens, diaries, and Chinese fiddles were sold. Before the material exchange meeting, fourteen tailor shops in Xinchang County, Zhejiang, rushed to make 11,200 sanitary masks, thinking it would be enough to supply market needs, but they were all snapped up in the first morning of the exchange meeting. Fourth, the proportion of cash-and-carry transactions at material exchange meetings in various regions has increased, indicating that the amount of currency in circulation has greatly increased during the peak season exchange meetings. The total transaction volume at the Fujian Provincial Material Exchange Meeting was 45.3 billion yuan, of which cash-and-carry transactions accounted for 69.5 percent. At the autumn urban and rural material exchange meetings held in sixteen county-level cities and thirty-five market towns in Anhui Province, the total purchase and sale volume was more than 5 billion yuan, of which 80 percent was cash-and-carry transactions. At the Sanjiang Town Material Exchange Meeting in Chongqing County, Sichuan Province, cash transactions accounted for more than 95 percent.

The main problems currently existing in material exchange meetings are: Some cadres in state-owned economic departments have conservative ideas and lack due understanding of the growing purchasing power of the masses. The material supply plans they make often lag behind actual needs, resulting in a situation where the supply of goods falls short of demand in some areas. Second, some cadres in some areas do not pay attention to organizing and uniting local private merchants, and strive to attract private merchants from other places to participate in material exchange meetings; some state-owned trade and cooperative cadres still have a blind tendency to exclude and restrict private merchants at exchange meetings. Third, some private merchants have engaged in tax evasion, adulteration, relying solely on government loans, speculative price increases, and profiteering from farmers in material exchange meetings. All of these hinder the further revitalization of urban-rural exchange, and local party and government leading organs should promptly correct them.

    全国各地召开的物资交流会上成交额大增
    充分显示广大农民的购买力日益提高
    秋季以来，全国各地为迎接贸易旺季，普遍召开了各种形式的物资交流会。这些物资交流会是在今年农业丰收、农民购买力提高和工业品增加的基础上举行的，因此，会上的成交额一般比往年为多，有的超过了好几倍。今年各地物资交流会显示了许多新的特点：第一、农民购买生产资料的能力增加了。例如，山西省贸易代表团仅在北京市物资交流会上，就订购了五万台步犁；烟台、青岛两市物资交流会上成交牲口达四百五十头。第二、农民对生活资料，要求更多的品种，更好的质量。内蒙古自治区的农民牧民们，往年一般是买土布作衣服，今年很多人买细布、花布和斜纹布。第三、广大人民对文化卫生用品的需求极大。在天津举行的华北物资交流会上，各地提出的笔记本、钢笔、铅笔、墨水及某些药品的订货单预订日期，已排到今年年底和明年春天。北京市物资交流会上，卖出许多皮球、钢笔、日记本和胡琴。浙江新昌县十四家裁缝铺在召开物资交流会前，赶制了一万一千二百只卫生口罩，以为足够供应市场需要，但在交流会第一个上午，就被抢购一空。第四、在各地物资交流会上，现款现货的交易额比重增大，这说明在旺季交流会上，货币流通量较往常大大增加了。福建省物资交流会上成交总额四百五十三亿元，其中现款现货交易额就达百分之六十九点五。安徽省十六个县以上城市及三十五个集镇举行的秋季城乡物资交流会上，购销总额五十多亿元，其中百分之八十是现款现货交易。四川省崇庆县三江镇物资交流会，现款交易达百分之九十五以上。
    目前物资交流会存在的主要问题是：有些国营经济部门的干部有保守思想，对群众购买力不断增长的状况，缺乏应有的认识，他们作出的物资供应计划往往落后于实际需要，以致部分地区形成物资供不应求的现象。其次，有些地区的干部不注意组织、团结本地私商，并争取外地私商，参加物资交流会；部分国营贸易、合作社干部在交流会上，还有盲目排挤私商、限制私商的情绪。第三，有些私商在物资交流会中曾发生偷漏税收，搀杂使假，单纯依赖政府贷款，投机抬价，厚利剥削农民的现象。这些，都阻碍了城乡交流的进一步活跃，各地党政领导机关应及时纠正。
