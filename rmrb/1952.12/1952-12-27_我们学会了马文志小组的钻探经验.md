    We Learned from the Drilling Experience of the Ma Wenzhi Team
    Editor: In our work, the Second Detachment of the Drilling Team of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government discovered that the overburden on the riverbed bedrock was alluvial, consisting of fine sand, pebbles, and boulders, which made drilling very difficult. It was often necessary to drive eight-millimeter-thick steel pipes into the ground to secure the borehole walls before drilling could begin. Sometimes, when encountering complex and deep geological conditions, we often couldn't drill all the way through. This affected the entire production and construction.
    Not long ago, our superiors required us to complete 540 meters of drilling at a certain location within a little over a month. The upper part of the hole at that location had twelve meters of quicksand, but our team didn't have a single casing. To solve this difficulty, veteran technicians Liu Wenbin, Song Huaiwen, and others went to the site every day to study. Later, we learned from the Ma Wenzhi drilling team's method of using mud to drill through the overburden on the mountains and applied it to drilling in the riverbed. The results of the experiment were: First, the borehole walls didn't collapse or leak water, and there was no need to install casings. Every day, only 200 liters of water were needed to mix into mud, which was enough for three shifts, solving the problem of water supply on the mountains. Second, the water pump's water supply was normal, and stone powder and iron filings in the hole were flushed out with the mud. There was no need to frequently repair the water pump, and no flushing time was needed. The pure drilling time was increased by 68 percent, and there was no need for a sand settling pipe. Third, the stone powder didn't sink immediately after the machine stopped, the borehole didn't easily collapse, and it was not prone to failure. Bai Baoyin

    我们学会了马文志小组的钻探经验
    编辑同志：我们中央人民政府水利部工程总局钻探总队第二分队在工作中，发现河床岩盘上部覆盖层都是冲积层，有细砂、卵石、孤石，钻起来非常困难，常常需要用八公厘厚的钢管打到地内，固定孔壁，才能开钻。有时遇到地质复杂而又深厚的情况，往往打到半路就打不下去了。这样就影响了整个生产建设。
    不久以前，上级要我们在一个多月时间内完成某处五百四十公尺的钻探任务。该处孔的上部有十二公尺的流砂层，但我队没有一根套管。为解决这一困难，老技工刘文彬、宋怀文等，每天到现场研究。后来我们学习了马文志钻探小组用泥浆在山上覆盖层钻进的方法，在河床上钻进。试验结果：一、孔壁不坍塌，不漏水，不用下套管，每天只要用二百公升的水搅成泥浆，就足够三班用，解决了山上供水的困难。二、水泵来水正常，孔内石粉与铁末随泥浆冲出，不需要经常修理水泵，不要冲孔时间，纯钻孔时间提高了百分之六十八，也不需要沉砂管。三、停车后石粉不马上下沉，钻孔不掉块，不易出故障。白保寅
