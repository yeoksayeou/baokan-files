    We Miss Soviet Comrades
    Miao Di, Fu Zhifang
    10. In my work, I learned many new knowledge principles from Comrade Darasov. For example, when repairing a hole in a boiler, I thought it would be enough to weld it shut. However, Comrade Darasov said: When a hole in a tank is damaged, a "reinforcement plate" must be added after welding, or other advanced Soviet experience should be used to extend the service life of the boiler.
    11. As the days went by, I gradually learned the general terminology of mechanical technology. So every night, we two would study problems together, and he also introduced me to some scientific books.
    12. Comrade Darasov was very good at getting close to the masses. When worker Han Shuzhi's sister got married, we bought some gifts. When Darasov found out, he also wanted to go to the wedding feast and bought some gifts to send.

    十、在工作中我向达拉索夫同志学到了许多新的知识原理，比如说：修补锅炉上的罐洞，我认为用电焊补住就可以了，但是，达拉索夫同志说：罐洞坏了一定要在电焊后再打“补强板”，或者用其它的苏联的先进经验，来延长锅炉的使用寿命。
    十一、日子一天天过去，一般的机械技术方面的名词我也渐渐学会了。所以每到晚上，我们俩人就在一起研究问题，他还介绍一些科学书籍给我。
    十二、达拉索夫同志非常善于接近群众，工友韩树枝的妹妹结婚，我们买了些礼品，达拉索夫知道了，他也要去吃喜酒，并且还买了些礼物送去。
