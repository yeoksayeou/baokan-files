    Cooperative Organizations in Xinxiang and Anyang Should Solve the Problem of Coal Shortage for Farmers
    To the Editor: There is a general shortage of coal in the rural areas of Xinxiang and Anyang Special Districts. Especially last November, when there was heavy rain and snow, and the roads were extremely muddy and difficult for vehicles to pass; the lack of fuel became even more serious. For example, in Lyu Village, Ye County, seven out of ten households had no coal to burn, and some burned all the fodder for livestock and firewood for manure accumulation. In the rural areas of Qi County and Jun County, private vendors sold coal for 1,000 yuan per four jin (the price of coal at the local Coal Industry Building Materials Company was 1,000 yuan per nine jin). In some areas, even living trees were cut down for firewood. On the other hand, the local Coal Industry Building Materials Company has a large amount of coal that cannot be sold. So, why is this happening? In addition to the objective condition of the weather, there are the following points:
    First of all, the cooperatives in the above-mentioned areas—especially the county-level cooperatives—do not pay enough attention to the coal supply problem and have serious conservative ideas. In the second half of this year, the Coal Industry Building Materials Companies of various counties have repeatedly contacted the cooperatives of various counties to sign coal sales contracts. However, many county cooperatives always emphasize various difficulties, such as fearing that the coal will not be sold, fearing that the coal will not be paid back after being sold to the masses on credit, and other trivial issues, repeatedly delaying the signing of the contract, or only willing to sign contracts for a small amount of coal. For example, after repeated contacts with the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, the Ye County Cooperative initially proposed that it only needed 1,000 tons of coal. Later, the masses and grassroots cooperatives in the county repeatedly requested the cooperative to solve the fuel problem, and the cooperative signed a contract with the Coal Industry Building Materials Company for 6,100 tons of coal; but when the contract was signed, the cooperative was afraid that the coal would not be sold and reduced the amount of coal to 5,600 tons. However, what is the reality? Up to now, the cooperative has successively signed contracts with the Coal Industry Building Materials Company for 20,000 tons of coal and has transported three-quarters of it to the countryside; however, the fuel needs of the masses have not yet been met, and there is still a general shortage of coal in the rural areas. At the same time, the farmers in the county paid immediately after buying coal, and there were very few cases of arrears. This fully proves that after the great increase in agricultural production, the potential demand for industrial products in the rural areas is very large, and all conservative ideas will cause great mistakes. Even worse, the Anyang County Cooperative does not allow grassroots cooperatives to sign contracts directly with the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, but it is unwilling to sign contracts with the Coal Industry Building Materials Company itself; the Tangyin County Cooperative signed a contract with the company in the first half of the year to sell 2,000 tons of coal, but has been delaying its implementation until now. In this way, the cooperative did not transport the winter coal to the masses in advance, and when transportation became difficult due to rain and snow, a coal shortage occurred in the rural areas.
    Secondly, the local party and government leading organs lack overall consideration when deploying work and do not take into account the organic connection between various tasks. For example, in October, the people's governments in some places arranged the "Three Autumns" work (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting), and all vehicles and horses were prohibited from going out; however, the issue of the masses' need for winter coal was not seriously considered.
    Finally, the Coal Industry Building Materials Companies in various places have not done enough to urge the cooperatives to take coal according to the signed contracts; many cadres believe that the matter is completed once the contract is signed, and they are not responsible for supervision. Therefore, as of the beginning of December, 200,000 tons of coal that should have been taken by the cooperatives of Xinxiang and Anyang Special Districts under the contracts signed with the Coal Industry Building Materials Companies in the second half of the year have not been taken.
    However, this serious lesson has not yet aroused attention in the cooperative organizations of many counties in the above-mentioned areas. They have not yet seriously organized the farmers to seize the sunny days to transport coal in a timely manner, and they still have a waiting mentality. This is very bad. If the weather changes again in the future, the coal shortage will be even more serious. Therefore, I suggest that the cooperatives of the above-mentioned two special districts pay attention to this issue and urge the county-level cooperative organizations to quickly and seriously solve the problem of coal shortage for the masses.　Niè Tiějūn

### 新乡、安阳两地合作社组织应该解决农民缺煤问题

    新乡、安阳两地合作社组织应该解决农民缺煤问题
    编辑同志：新乡、安阳两专区农村普遍缺煤。尤其在去年十一月份，当地雨雪甚大，道路泥泞不堪，车辆通行十分困难；缺乏燃料的现象更为严重。如邺县吕村十家中就有七家没煤烧，有的把喂牲口的草料和积肥的柴草都烧光了。淇县及浚县农村中私商小贩的煤卖到一千元四斤（当地煤业建筑器材公司煤价是一千元九斤）。有的地区甚至砍伐活树当柴烧。但另一方面，当地煤业建筑器材公司却存有大量的煤卖不下去。那未，为什么发生这种情况呢？除了天时这个客观条件以外，还有下列几点：
    首先，上述地区的合作社——尤其是县级的合作社对煤炭供应问题重视不够，有着严重的保守思想。今年下半年当地各县煤业建筑器材公司曾多次和各县合作社接洽签订售煤合同。但很多县的合作社总强调各种困难，如怕煤卖不了、怕煤赊给群众后收不回款以及其他一些枝节问题，一再拖延，使合同迟迟不能签订，或者只肯签订少量煤额的合同。如邺县合作社经煤业建筑器材公司一再联系，最初提出只需煤一千吨。后来该县群众和各基层合作社再三要求该社解决燃料问题，该社才和煤业建筑器材公司订立六千一百吨煤的合同；而到合同签字时，该社又怕煤卖不了，把煤额削减为五千六百吨。但是，事实怎样呢？到现在为止，该社又陆续和煤业建筑器材公司订了两万吨煤的合同，并已运了四分之三下乡；而群众燃料需要仍未满足，农村还是普遍缺煤。同时，该县农民买煤后立即付款，很少赊欠现象。这充分证明：在农业生产大大提高以后，农村需用工业品的潜力是很大的，一切保守思想必将造成很大的错误。更不好的是：安阳县合作社不许基层合作社与煤业建筑器材公司直接订合同，但自己却又不肯与煤业建筑器材公司签订合同；汤阴县合作社上半年与公司签订了销煤两千吨的合同，到现在仍拖延不予执行。就这样，合作社没有事先把冬煤运到群众手里，遇到雨雪时运输发生困难，农村便出现了煤荒现象。
    其次，当地党政领导机关在布置工作时缺乏通盘考虑，没有照顾到各种工作之间的有机联系。如十月份某些地方的人民政府布置三秋工作（秋收、秋耕、秋种），车马一律禁止出付；而对群众需用冬煤的问题却没有认真考虑。
    最后，各地煤业建筑器材公司对督促合作社按签订的合同取煤这一点，也作得不够；不少干部认为订了合同就算完事大吉了，没有负责督促。因此，截至十二月上旬止，新乡、安阳两专区合作社和煤业建筑器材公司所订下半年合同中应取的煤，还有二十万吨没有取去。
    但是，这一个严重的教训在上述地区很多县的合作社方面，到现在还没有引起重视，他们还没有认真组织农民抓紧晴天及时运煤，而依然有着等待思想。这是很不好的。如果以后天时再变，缺煤情况将会更严重。因此，我建议上述两专区合作社重视这个问题，督促各县级合作社机构迅速认真地解决群众缺煤的问题。　聂铁钧
