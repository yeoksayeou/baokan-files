North China Region Actively Prepares for Basic Construction Work

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China region, in order to meet next year's large-scale economic construction, is actively carrying out preparations for basic construction. The Construction Engineering Bureau of the Administrative Council of North China of the Government Administration Council has been established, and more than 100 cadres have been transferred from various provinces, including 9 cadres at or above the level of prefectural committee. The original North China Basic Construction Engineering Company has been reorganized and expanded into two directly subordinate construction companies and one directly subordinate design company, and recently more than 100 transferred cadres have been added, including 5 cadres at or above the level of prefectural committee. The Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has also been established and equipped with more than 100 cadres. Beijing Municipality and Shanxi Province are actively preparing to organize construction engineering bureaus. Up to now, 39 construction engineering companies and 1 construction cooperative have been established in the North China region. The number of administrative management personnel in the construction sector throughout the region has increased by 4.5% compared with the first half of the year, and the number of construction workers has increased by 41%.

In order to do a good job in basic construction design, provinces and cities in the North China region are concentrating talents in large quantities, rationally adjusting the use of designers, and preparing to adopt centralized design methods. In addition, they are also studying and trying out design standard drawings, labor and material quotas, and learning advanced Soviet design methods. The Shanxi Provincial Design Company has recruited more than 50 students with junior high school education or above for training. After four months of training, they will be assigned to work as technical cadres for assistant design. The company summarized this year's design work in November, and from the lessons of this year's blind design, put forward improvement measures. Detailed statistics were made on the design volume of each person, the unit cost, the amount of materials used per square meter, and various expenses, which fully prepared the design and planning work.

In terms of preparing construction strength, North China is strengthening construction companies, especially the organizational structure of industrial zones and construction sites, and at the same time, is seizing the work of fixing permanent workers. Taiyuan City has fixed 90% of its long-term workers (plus seasonal workers, a total of 11,000 people). Hebei Province has fixed 25,000 long-term and seasonal workers. Beijing Municipality can also complete the plan of fixing workers by the end of the year. Winter training in construction departments in various places will begin around December 10. Taiyuan City has made preliminary statistics and plans for next year's basic construction tasks, clearly dividing the specific work scope of design and construction. Design, construction, materials, transportation and other departments have also established a chain contract system of mutual responsibility, ensuring smooth construction and ensuring project quality. In addition, in order to further overcome the difficulty of the extreme mismatch between design and construction strength and construction tasks, the Construction Engineering Bureau of the Administrative Council of North China of the Government Administration Council convened the North China Construction Engineering Conference on December 1 to discuss the deployment of basic construction work in this winter and next spring, conduct a preliminary ranking of projects and strengths, and further study design standard drawings, engineering labor and material quotas, and the implementation of economic accounting system based on construction sites.

    华北区积极准备基本建设工作
    【本报讯】华北区为迎接明年大规模经济建设，正在积极进行基本建设的准备工作。政务院华北行政委员会建筑工程局已成立，先后由各省调来干部一百余名，其中有地委级以上的干部九人。原华北基本建设工程公司已改组扩大为两个直属施工公司、一个直属设计公司，最近增加一百余名转业干部，其中有地委级以上干部五人。天津市建筑工程局也已成立，并配备了一百余名干部。北京市及山西省在积极筹备组织建筑工程局。到目前为止，华北全区先后已建立建筑工程公司三十九个，建筑合作社一个。全区建筑部门的行政管理人员，比上半年增加百分之四点五，建筑工人增加百分之四十一。
    为了做好基本建设的设计工作，华北区各省、市正在大量集中人材，合理调整使用设计人员和准备采取集中设计的方法。此外，还在研究试行设计标准图样、工料定额，并学习苏联先进设计方法。山西省设计公司，招收了五十多名初中程度以上的学生进行训练，训练四个月后，将分派他们做助理设计的技术干部。该公司曾于十一月份内总结了今年的设计工作，从今年盲目设计的教训中，提出了改进的措施。对每人的设计量、单位造价、每平方公尺用料数、各种费用等作了详细统计，给设计、计划工作作了充分准备。
    在准备施工力量方面，华北各地正加强施工公司，特别是工区工地组织机构，同时抓紧进行固定工人的工作。太原市长期工已固定百分之九十（加上季节工，共一万一千人）。河北省已固定长期工和季节工两万五千人。北京市到年底也可完成固定工人的计划。各地建筑部门的冬季整训都将于十二月十日前后开始。太原市已对明年基本建设任务作了初步统计与计划，明确地划分了设计与施工的具体工作范围，设计、施工、材料、运输等部门还建立了相互负责、保证顺利施工和保证工程质量的连环合同制。此外，为了进一步克服设计、施工力量和建设任务极不相称的困难，政务院华北行政委员会建筑工程局于十二月一日召开了华北区建筑工程会议，讨论了今冬明春基本建设工作的布置，进行了工程和力量的初步排队，并进一步研究了设计标准图样、工程工料定额和以工地为单位实行经济核算制等问题。
