To the Editor: I am a Tibetan youth from Yunnan Province, currently studying at the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing. From my personal experiences, I have found the path to the liberation of our ethnic minorities. I want to follow the Communist Party forever and dedicate my strength to building our great motherland—the big family of all ethnic groups.

I am from Deqin, Lijiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province. My family originally had eight people, relying on renting more than one mu of land from landlords and growing some flowers to make a living. We couldn't even eat highland barley and coarse grains, and sometimes we had to eat wild vegetables and grass roots. Eating a meal of rice during festivals was like seeing ginseng. We wore tattered clothes and lived in moldy thatched houses. But even with such a life, the Kuomintang reactionaries still wouldn't let us live in peace. The local pseudo-security regiment chief, who suppressed the people, seized the flowers and trees in my home. My father reasoned with him and was arrested and imprisoned, where he was tortured to death. My mother was driven crazy by this shock, coupled with the pressures of life. My younger brother starved to death. My brother and I both went to work as coolies for landlords, and we were beaten countless times. And disaster after disaster, a platoon leader of the Kuomintang bandit army inhumanely snatched my young aunt and occupied my house. We were forced into ruin by the reactionary rulers. I wanted revenge, but I couldn't find a way.

In early 1949, the guerrilla forces led by the Communist Party appeared in our hometown. I disregarded all threats and obstacles and joined my own ranks. Under the education of the Party, I raised my class consciousness and strengthened my revolutionary determination. In order to avenge my father and mother, to avenge the oppressed people of our own ethnic group, and to avenge all the oppressed working people of China, I fiercely attacked the enemy in many arduous and fierce battles and completed the tasks assigned to me by my superiors.

Yunnan was liberated, and the people of our ethnic minorities were emancipated. The people's motherland gave our ethnic minorities infinite warmth and care, helping us develop in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and health. Our lives are getting better day by day. However, in order to help us create a better and happier life, the Party and the People's Government are also very concerned about cultivating various construction talents and cadres from our ethnic minorities.

In 1950, I was transferred to study at the Southwest University for Nationalities. In April 1952, I came to the Central University for Nationalities to study. The school takes great care of us, doing everything possible to provide us with better learning conditions. In the past two years, my political level has greatly improved, and I also have the cultural level of junior high school. I thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for bringing happiness to our ethnic minorities, and I also know that a better life in the future still needs to be created by ourselves. I promise to study hard, strive to train myself into a working-class fighter with both moral integrity and ability, and dedicate my strength to the bright future of our nation and the prosperity and strength of the great motherland.

    藏族青年张国生来信决心为建设伟大祖国而努力
    编辑同志：我是云南省的一个藏族青年，现在北京中央民族学院学习。我从亲身经历中找到了我们少数民族解放的道路。我要永远跟着共产党走，为建设我们伟大的祖国——各族人民的大家庭而献出自己的力量。
    我是云南省丽江专区德钦人。家里原有八口人，靠租种地主的一亩多地和种些花来过日子。我们吃青稞杂粮还吃不上，有时还得吃野菜草根，过节时吃一顿大米饭就像见了人参一样；穿的破破烂烂；住的是霉烂的草屋。但就是这样的日子，国民党反动派还是不让我们过下去。当地镇压人民的伪保安团团总霸占我家的花木，我父亲和他讲理，就被抓去坐牢，活活折磨死了。母亲受了这个刺激，再加上被生活逼迫，就急疯了。弟弟活活饿死了。我和哥哥都去给地主做苦工，不知受了多少次毒打。而灾难接着灾难，国民党匪军的一个排长，又毫无人性地抢走了我的年青的姑母，霸占了我家的房子。我们就这样被反动统治者逼得家破人亡。我要报仇，但是却找不到道路。
    一九四九年初，共产党领导下的游击队在我们家乡出现了。我不顾一切威胁和阻碍，参加了自己的队伍。在党的教育下，我提高了阶级觉悟，坚定了革命的决心。为了替我父亲母亲报仇，替我们本族受压迫的人民报仇，替全中国受压迫的劳动人民报仇，我在很多次艰苦激烈的战斗中都狠狠地打击敌人，完成了上级给我的任务。
    云南解放了，我们少数民族的人民翻了身。人民的祖国给我们少数民族以无限的温暖和照顾，在政治、经济和文化卫生各方面都帮助我们发展。我们的日子一天比一天好了。但是，党和人民政府为了帮助我们创造更美好幸福的生活，还十分关怀地培养我们少数民族的各种建设人才和干部。
    一九五○年，我被调到西南民族学院学习；一九五二年四月，我又来中央民族学院学习了。学校对我们的照顾非常周到，尽一切可能让我们有更好的学习条件。两年多来，我的政治水平大大提高了，并且也有了初中的文化水平。我感谢毛主席、共产党给我们少数民族带来了幸福，我也知道今后更美好的生活还有待于我们自己去创造。我保证要好好学习，努力把自己锻炼成一个德才兼备的工人阶级的斗士，为我们民族的美好前途、为伟大祖国的强盛繁荣而献出自己的力量。
