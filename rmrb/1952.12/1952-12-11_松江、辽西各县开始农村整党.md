    Rural Party Consolidation Begins in Songjiang and Liaoxi Counties

    Rural party consolidation work has begun in various counties of Songjiang Province. It is estimated that over 35,000 party members across the province will participate in the party consolidation (with another 8,000 party members postponing participation due to involvement in winter logging work), and 35,000 non-party activists will participate in the party consolidation study.

    The rural party organizations in Songjiang Province, having been tempered in political movements such as land reform, support for the Liberation War, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, and in production and construction, have played a significant leading role. During the rectification campaign in 1950, the party organizations underwent a reorganization, thus the rural party organizations in Songjiang Province are basically pure and consolidated. However, due to some party organizations lowering the standards for party membership in the past, and the lack of systematic party education on ordinary days, many rural party members have an unclear understanding of the direction of rural economic development. Furthermore, influenced by the spontaneous development of capitalism on the basis of the individual economy of farmers, some party members have developed exploitative thoughts and behaviors, as well as illegal and undisciplined commandist work styles that detach them from the masses. In light of this situation, the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee convened a joint meeting of organization department heads from all county committees on September 26th, meticulously studying and arranging the winter rural party consolidation work. The meeting emphasized that to do a good job in party consolidation, it is necessary to implement the principle of combining enlightenment education from the leadership with the self-ideological transformation of the broad masses of party members, and to adopt a process of concentrated training in batches and zones, followed by democratic make-up sessions in the villages after training. The party consolidation work across the province will be carried out in approximately two or three batches. The first batch of rural party member training is of a typical experimental nature, with most party consolidation cadres from each district participating in the typical experimental work to learn the experience of party consolidation education and organizational leadership, and to steadily carry out the second and third batches of party member training. The party consolidation work across the province is expected to be completed by the end of February next year.

    In order to provide in-depth leadership, promptly discover problems, solve problems, and summarize experiences, the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee has specially transferred more than 100 party member cadres from party schools and provincial directly affiliated agencies (including four department heads and division chiefs, and ten county party secretaries or cadres equivalent to county party secretaries) to form twelve work teams, which will go to twelve counties, including Acheng, Lalin, Hailin, Tangyuan, Boli, and Fujin, to supervise and guide the work; each county has also organized and trained 1,900 cadres to do party consolidation work. In total, more than 2,000 cadres across the province are participating in the party consolidation work.

    In the process of party consolidation mobilization, in counties where the mobilization work has been done relatively well, sufficient forces have been organized, cadres have been dispatched to go deep into the rural areas to carry out mobilization, explain the purpose, principles, and policies of party consolidation, and encourage everyone to actively participate in party consolidation, eliminating the concerns of party members. Where this has been done, party members and the masses warmly support the party consolidation work. In some villages, the masses helped party members chop firewood for twenty days in two days, milled rice, and finished threshing early, so that party members could concentrate on studying. After understanding the purpose of party consolidation, the party members and masses of Tiande Village in Bayan County launched challenges against each other, making mutual guarantees to study diligently and do a good job in the work of the village. The masses in Wuchang County encouraged party members, saying: "Go! Don't worry about your family, study hard, and come back to lead us on the new road." In some places, because the party consolidation mobilization was not carried out well, party members had more ideological concerns. Some were afraid of delaying production, some were afraid of addressing corruption issues, and some were afraid of settling accounts for exploitation. A female party member in Dongli Village, Seventh District, Wuchang County, did not dare to participate in the study because her husband was lending money at interest.

    In order to do a good job in party consolidation education, the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee has also organized nine mobile film teams, equipped with twenty-two films such as "Happy Life," "Spring in the Mountains," "The White-Haired Girl," "Boundless Light," and "Steel Warrior," one hundred and twelve sets of slides such as "Spark Collective Farm" and "Soviet Collective Farm," and seventy-two sets of pictures reflecting the advanced experience of Soviet agriculture, advanced figures, and the lives of the Soviet people, preparing to take turns to perform and exhibit in counties without cinemas or with inconvenient transportation, and organize farmer representatives who have visited the Soviet Union to make reports in various places. Some counties have also prepared party consolidation education materials, such as Bin County, which has prepared pictures, comic strips, and charts showing the county's five-year production plan and the growth process of agricultural production cooperatives, as well as 4,000 copies of various booklets (including collective farms and agricultural production technology), 3,000 copies of party member textbooks, and has drawn the work style and work methods of Jiang Fengwu, the branch secretary of the county, into comic strips. In addition, counties such as Shangzhi, Bin, and Yanshou have also organized temporary nurseries to relieve women party members of their concerns about their children, so that they can study with peace of mind.

    After full preparation, the party consolidation work in Liaoxi Province also began universally at the beginning of this month. More than 33,000 people across the province are participating in party consolidation education, and more than 56,000 non-party activists have also been absorbed to participate. There are more than 4,000 cadres across the province leading the party consolidation work. These cadres have all been trained in rural party consolidation teacher training classes run by the provincial party committee or the county party committee, clarifying the purpose, principles, and policies of party consolidation.

    According to reports from Beizhen, Changtu, Xinmin, and Panshan counties in Liaoxi Province, wherever the ideological mobilization work is done conscientiously, and the party consolidation principles and policies are implemented among party members and the masses, the party consolidation work proceeds relatively smoothly. The party consolidation work group in the First District of Beizhen County paid attention to understanding the party members' various understandings of party consolidation before going to the villages, and studied the problems that may occur in the work of the village when party members are in concentrated study; then, targeting various erroneous ideas, held various meetings, such as party member meetings, symposiums of party member families, repeatedly explaining the party consolidation principles and policies, improving party members' understanding of party consolidation, encouraging party members to actively participate in party consolidation, and dispelling some of the concerns of party member families about party consolidation. At the same time, they organized a village temporary work committee to take over the administrative work undertaken by party member cadres, and helped party members solve some specific problems in family production during the study period. For example, He Suqin (female), a party member in Zhangdai Village, First District, was preparing to leave after receiving the party consolidation study notice. Her father-in-law clamored and refused to let her go. Later, after the work group explained the purpose of party consolidation, her father-in-law not only helped her make various preparations, but also personally sent her to the training class, urging her to study hard. Because the leadership in the First District of Beizhen County paid attention to collecting information on the ideological situation of party members before party consolidation, paid attention to the work of party member families during party consolidation mobilization, and also paid attention to continuing to dispel some people's ideological concerns after party members were concentrated in the training class, this ensured the smooth progress of the party consolidation work. The CPC Liaoxi Provincial Committee issued a circular on the 1st of this month, pointing out that doing a good job in ideological mobilization is an important step in party consolidation, and requiring all counties to first convene branch meetings when mobilizing party members to attend collective training, clarifying the party consolidation principles, purpose, and policies, and understanding and resolving various ideological concerns through symposiums, so that party members have a clear understanding.

### 松江、辽西各县开始农村整党

    松江、辽西各县开始农村整党
    松江省各县已开始进行农村整党工作。预计全省有三万五千余名党员参加整党（另有八千名党员因参加冬季采伐工作，缓期进行整党），并有三万五千名非党积极分子参加整党学习。    
    松江省的农村党组织，在土地改革、支援解放战争、镇压反革命、抗美援朝等政治运动及生产建设中受到锻炼，曾发挥了巨大的领导作用。一九五○年整风期间，党的组织作了一次整理，因此松江省农村的党组织基本上是纯洁的巩固的。但由于过去吸收党员时某些党组织有降低党员标准的现象，平日又缺乏系统的党课教育，致使不少农村党员对农村经济发展方向认识不清。再由于在农民个体经济基础上自发发展起来的资本主义的影响，有些党员滋生了剥削思想、剥削行为，及违法乱纪、脱离群众的命令主义作风。根据这一情况，中共松江省委于九月二十六日，召开了全省县委组织部长联席会议，周密地研究和布置冬季农村整党工作，强调指出要做好整党工作必须贯彻领导方面的启发教育与广大党员的自我思想改造相结合的方针，采用分批分片集中训练，训练后回村民主补课的程序。全省整党工作大致分两批或三批进行。第一批农村党员训练是典型试验性质，每区大部分整党干部都参加典型试验工作，以便学习整党教育及组织领导的经验，稳步进行第二批、第三批的党员集训。全省整党工作预计明年二月末结束。
    为了深入领导，及时发现问题，解决问题，总结经验，中共松江省委特从党校、省直属机关抽调一百余名党员干部（其中有厅长、处长四名，县委书记或相当于县委书记的干部十名）组成十二个工作队，分别到阿城、拉林、海林、汤原、勃利、富锦等十二个县督促指导；各县也组织、训练了一千九百名干部做整党工作。总计，全省参加整党工作的干部共二千余人。
    在整党动员过程中，凡是动员工作做得比较好的县份，即组织了充分力量，派遣干部深入农村进行动员，讲解整党目的、方针、政策，鼓励大家积极参加整党，消除党员顾虑的，党员和群众都热烈拥护整党工作。有的村子群众帮助党员在两天内打了二十天用的柴，碾好米，提前打完场，使党员安心去学习。巴彦天德村的党员和群众了解了整党目的以后，互相展开了挑战，互相提出保证认真学习，把村的工作搞好。五常县的群众鼓励党员说：“你去吧！不要挂家，好好学习，回来好领导我们走新道路。”有一些地方因为没有很好地进行整党动员，党员思想顾虑较多。有的怕耽误生产，有的怕整贪污问题，有的怕算剥削账。五常县七区东利村的一个女党员，因丈夫放债，便不敢参加学习。
    为了做好整党教育，中共松江省委还组织了九个流动电影队，备有“幸福的生活”、“山野的春天”、“白毛女”、“光芒万丈”、“钢铁战士”等二十二部影片，“星火集体农庄”、“苏联集体农庄”等一百十二套幻灯片，及反映苏联农业先进经验、先进人物及苏联人民生活的图片七十二套，准备轮流到没有电影院或交通不便的县份演出和展览，并组织访苏农民代表们到各地作报告。有些县也准备了整党教育材料，如宾县准备了图片、连环画和该县的五年生产计划以及农业生产合作社的成长过程等图表，还有各种小册子（有集体农庄、农业生产技术）四千册，党员课本三千册，并将该县支部书记姜凤伍的工作作风和工作方法画成了连环画。此外，尚志、宾县、延寿等县还组织了临时托儿所，解除妇女党员对孩子的牵挂，使她们安心学习。
    辽西省的整党工作经过充分准备后亦于本月初普遍开始。全省参加整党教育的有三万三千多人，另外还吸收非党积极分子五万六千多人参加。全省领导整党工作的干部有四千多人。这些干部都分别经过省委或县委开办的农村整党教员训练班训练，弄清了整党目的方针和政策。
    据辽西省北镇、昌图、新民、盘山等县反映：哪里认真做好思想动员工作，把整党方针、政策贯彻到党员群众中去，哪里的整党工作就进行得比较顺利。北镇县一区整党工作组在没有下村以前就注意了了解党员对整党的各种认识，研究党员在集中学习时，村里工作上可能发生的问题；然后针对着各种错误思想，召开各种会议：如党员大会、党员家属座谈会，反复说明整党方针、政策，提高党员对整党的认识，鼓舞党员积极参加整党，解除党员家属对整党的一些顾虑。同时组织村临时工作委员会，接办党员干部所担任的行政工作，并帮助党员解决学习期间家庭生产方面的一些具体问题。如一区张代村党员何素琴（女）在接到整党学习通知后，就着手准备动身。她的公公却吵嚷着不让她去，后来经过工作组说明了整党目的，她的公公不但帮助她做好各方面的准备，还亲自送她到训练班，嘱咐她好好学习。由于北镇一区领导方面在整党以前注意了搜集党员思想情况，在整党动员时注意了党员家属工作，而且在党员集中到训练班以后，又注意了继续解除某些人的思想顾虑，这就保证了整党工作的顺利进展。中共辽西省委在本月一日曾发出通报，指出做好思想动员工作是整党的重要步骤，要求各县在动员党员集训时，首先召开支部会，讲清整党方针、目的和政策，并通过座谈会的方式了解和解
    决各种思想顾虑，使党员心中有了底。
