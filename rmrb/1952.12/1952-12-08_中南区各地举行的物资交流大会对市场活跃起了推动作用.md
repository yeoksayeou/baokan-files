    Material exchange conferences held in various parts of Central and South China promote market activity

    In the second half of this year, the various levels of market material exchange conferences held in Central and South China have greatly promoted market activity. According to incomplete statistics from July, August, and September, there were more than 4,000 large and small material exchange fairs held in provinces, special districts, counties, and market towns throughout the Central and South China region, with a total transaction value of over 5.4 trillion yuan. After October, due to the large-scale marketing of agricultural products, various regions widely held short-distance exchange medium and small material exchange conferences to meet the purchasing and sales requirements of the vast number of farmers. From October to early November, the total transaction value of primary market material exchange conferences in various parts of Guangdong exceeded 600 billion yuan. During this period, Central and South China also organized a number of trade delegations to participate in material exchange conferences in North China and East China. Participating in the Second North China Material Exchange Conference and the Beijing Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference alone resulted in a transaction value of 478.2 billion yuan, allowing Central and South China's native and special products, such as live pigs, tung oil, and native sugar, worth over 250 billion yuan to find sales markets. Through the convening of these conferences and a large number of transactions, the connection between large, medium, and small cities and between urban and rural areas in Central and South China has become closer, creating favorable conditions for further activating the market, promoting economic prosperity, developing production, and welcoming the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin.

    今年下半年，中南区各地相继举行的各级市场物资交流大会，对活跃市场起了很大的推动作用。据七、八、九三个月不完全的统计，中南全区举行的省、专区、县、集镇的大小物资交流会有四千多次，成交总额达五万四千余亿元。进入十月份后，因农业品的大量上市，各地为适应广大农民的购销要求，又普遍举行了短距离交流的中、小型物资交流会。十月到十一月上旬止，广东各地初级市场物资交流会的成交总额在六千亿元以上。在此期间，中南各地还组织了不少贸易代表团到华北、华东参加外区物资交流会，仅参加华北区第二届物资交流大会和北京市城乡物资交流大会，成交总值就达四千七百八十二亿元，使中南区价值二千五百余亿元的生猪、桐油、土糖等土、特产品获得了销售市场。通过以上这些会的召开和大量成交，使中南区大、中、小城市之间和城乡之间的联系更加紧密了，为今后进一步活跃市场、繁荣经济、发展生产、迎接就要到来的大规模经济建设，创造了有利条件。
