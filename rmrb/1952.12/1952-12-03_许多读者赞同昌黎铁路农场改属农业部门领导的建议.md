    Many Readers Agree with the Suggestion of Transferring Changli Railway Farm to the Leadership of the Agricultural Department

    Editor's Note: After this column published readers' suggestions on "Changli Railway Farm Should be Transferred to the Leadership of the Agricultural Department" on November 20th, many readers wrote to support this suggestion. We are now publishing three of them here. We believe that the readers' opinions are correct. The Tianjin Railway Administration should quickly handle this matter and completely transfer this farm to the management of the Central Ministry of Agriculture. We also hope that the Tianjin Railway Administration will inform us of the handling results.

    Editor: We have made suggestions to the People's Government at the Changli County People's Representative Conference on the development direction and adjustment of the leadership system of the Changli Railway Farm. The content of our suggestion is the same as the opinions of the twelve agricultural workers on the Changli Railway Farm published in the People's Daily on November 20th. Based on our personal experience, this farm has very little contact with the masses. In the past, we requested fine varieties—Indian apple scions—from the farm to improve the local apple varieties, but the farm only gave one, which was far from meeting the needs of the masses. The fruit tree varieties owned by the farm are indeed very valuable. If they are led by the government's agricultural department to conduct fruit tree gardening experiments and promotion, it will definitely be of great benefit to the masses, and it will also have a great effect on the development of fruit tree production in mountainous areas. With the same mood as the twelve agricultural workers, we hope that the competent authorities will quickly resolve this issue.

    Song De'en, Yin Rong, Guo Yintong, Yang Bingsheng, Song Yuhua, Su Guoen, Zheng Shilin, Yang Jingzhou, Long Peiran, Qi Ruisheng

    Editor: We believe that the suggestion made by Yu Yongzhong and other twelve agricultural workers on "Changli Railway Farm Should be Transferred to the Leadership of the Agricultural Department" is correct. Changli, Zunhua, Funing, Lulong, Luanxian, Qian'an and other places are important fruit producing areas in North China. Changli is the center of this fruit producing area. As far as we know, in addition to a large number of fine fruit tree varieties, this farm also has meteorological stations, fruit tree laboratories, chemical analysis laboratories and other equipment. Such a fruit tree experiment institution should be managed by the agricultural department. Because only in this way can it play its due role to meet the needs of local people for fine varieties.
    At the same time, we believe that the Tianjin Railway Administration's operation of the Changli Railway Farm as a sideline production is a violation of the spirit of the "Decision on Unified Handling of Organ Production" issued by the Government Administration Council on March 12 this year.

    Editor: I think the suggestion of "Changli Railway Farm Should be Transferred to the Leadership of the Agricultural Department" published in the People's Daily reader's letters column on November 20th is very correct. I have worked in this farm for more than ten years, and I know the situation of this farm very well. Indeed, from the superior conditions of this farm, it should play a certain role in the development of fruit tree gardening in our country, but because it is not under the leadership of the agricultural department and the management method is not appropriate, it cannot play its role. As far as I know, most of the fruit trees in this farm are gradually degrading and decreasing, and even many precious fruit tree varieties have been eradicated. In order to cooperate with the country's economic construction in the future and develop fruit tree gardening, the current situation of this farm cannot continue. I hope that the relevant departments will accept this suggestion and make a reasonable solution as soon as possible.

### 许多读者赞同昌黎铁路农场改属农业部门领导的建议

专栏：读者来信

    许多读者赞同昌黎铁路农场改属农业部门领导的建议
    编者按：本栏在十一月二十日发表了读者关于“昌黎铁路农场应改属农业部门领导”的建议以后，许多读者来信拥护这个建议。我们现在发表其中的三封在这里。我们认为，读者的意见是正确的。天津铁路管理局应该迅速处理这件事情，把这个农场完整地移交给中央农业部管理。并希望天津铁路管理局把处理结果告诉我们。
    编辑同志：关于昌黎铁路农场的发展方向和调整领导系统的问题，我们曾在昌黎县各界人民代表会议上，向人民政府提出过建议。我们建议的内容和人民日报十一月二十日所载十二位农业工作者对昌黎铁路农场的意见是一样的。根据我们亲身的体验，这个农场和群众的接触是很少的。过去我们曾向该场要求过优良品种——印度苹果的接穗，来改良当地苹果的品种，但是该场只给了一支，远不能满足群众的要求。该场所拥有的果树品种，确是很宝贵的，如果由政府农业部门领导，进行果树园艺的试验和推广，对群众的好处一定是很大的，对发展山区果树生产的作用也是很大的。我们怀着和十二位农业工作者同样的心情，希望主管部门迅速地解决这个问题。河北省昌黎县山区果农代表　宋德恩　印　荣
    郭荫桐　杨秉圣　宋玉华　苏国恩
    郑士林　杨景周　龙沛然　齐瑞生
    编辑同志：我们认为于用中等十二个农业工作者提出的关于“昌黎铁路农场应改属农业部门领导”的建议是正确的。昌黎、遵化、抚宁、卢龙、滦县、迁安等地是华北重要的果产区。昌黎又是这一果产区的中心。据我们知道，这个农场除了拥有大量优良果树品种外，还有气象台、果树试验室、化学分析室等设备。像这样一个果树试验机构，是应该改由农业部门管理的。因为只有这样才能发挥它应有的作用，以满足当地群众要求优良品种的需要。
    同时我们认为：天津铁路管理局把昌黎铁路农场作为副业生产经营，是违反今年三月十二日政务院发布的“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”的精神的。　宋允淑　张琼姿　张春波　柯宁白

    编辑同志：我认为十一月二十日人民日报读者来信栏刊载的“昌黎铁路农场应改属农业部门领导”的建议，是非常正确的。我在这个农场工作了十数年，我很了解这个农场的情况。的确，从这个农场具备的优越条件来说，是应该对我国果树园艺的发展发挥一定的作用的，但是由于它不属于农业部门领导，经营方式又不适当，以致不能发挥它的作用。据我了解，这个农场的大部果树已在逐渐退化和减少，甚至有很多珍贵果树品种已都被刨绝了。为了配合今后国家的经济建设，发展果树园艺，这个农场的现状是不能继续下去了。我希望有关部门，接受这个建议，速作合理解决。　马文庆
