Mayor Peng Zhen of the Beijing Municipal People's Government held a grand banquet on the evening of the 18th to bid farewell to some members of the Soviet Art Troupe led by Chulaki and all members of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation headed by Fedorov, who are about to leave Beijing. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, hosted the banquet on behalf of Mayor Peng Zhen. Those present at the banquet included: Wu Yuzhang and Li Jishen, Vice Presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General, and directors and staff in Beijing, Xiao Ming and Sun Xiaocun, Vice Presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Li Zhigan, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee of the Fourth Beijing People's Representative Conference, heads of various departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, heads of various people's organizations in Beijing, and cultural and art figures from the capital, including Zhou Yang, Yang Hansheng, Tian Han, Zheng Zhenduo, Xiong Fu, Zhang Zhongshi, Cao Yu, Li Bozhao, Zhou Weizhi, Wu Xue, Wang Lanxi, Cai Chusheng, Shi Dongshan, Tian Fang, Wang Yang, Luo Guangda, and Li Zhaobing, etc.

Deputy Mayor Wu Han delivered a speech at the banquet. First, on behalf of the government and people of the capital, he extended heartfelt thanks and the highest respect to the comrades of the Soviet Art Troupe and the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation. He said: "In the various activities of the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month' that have been enthusiastically launched throughout our country for more than a month, the arrival of our dearest Soviet friends and their work in various parts of China have greatly enriched the content of the activities, not only further developing the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, greatly promoting the cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union, but also enabling our people to receive concentrated and universal practical education on the prospects of socialism and communism. People have fully understood that in order to build our country into a prosperous and strong country, we must follow the path that the Soviet people have victoriously taken and advance bravely. Therefore, learning from the Soviet Union has formed an unprecedented upsurge among the people of the whole country." In his speech, Wu Han finally hoped that Soviet friends would convey to the Soviet people the Chinese people's respect for the Soviet people and their love for Comrade Stalin.

Chulaki, the leader of the Soviet Art Troupe, said in his speech at the banquet: "We have visited China for nearly two months and have a deep and indelible impression of China. Every day and every hour, we see the expression of deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. We saw the happy light shining in the eyes of the Chinese people, especially the Chinese youth, because they can freely build their beautiful life; we deeply felt the great creative power in the labor of the Chinese people; we also saw the results of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, and saw that the learning and promotion of advanced Soviet experience is being carried out on a large scale, which will enable China to complete the road the Soviet Union has traveled in a relatively short period of time and make China a prosperous country. We Soviet artists feel very honored to be able to contribute to Sino-Soviet friendship."

Fedorov, the head of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation, said in his speech: "The moving scenes of our meetings with Chinese audiences during our visit to China will never be forgotten. We have come to know and become familiar with the labor and life of the Chinese people, and we have also come to know China's achievements in industry, agriculture, culture, and art. What impressed us most is the image of the great Chinese people. China is about to start large-scale economic construction, and we wish the Chinese people to over fulfill this construction plan, just as the Soviet people fulfilled the Stalin Five-Year Plan. I deeply thank the Central People's Government, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Chinese film workers for their help."

Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke at the banquet. He expressed his gratitude for the hard work of Soviet friends in China and their great contribution to strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship. He said: "The Chinese people, in accordance with Chairman Mao Zedong's instruction to 'take the road of the Russians,' have achieved great achievements, which is inseparable from the help of Soviet friends. We are about to start a new large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, and we will continue to 'take the road of the Russians' and victoriously move towards socialism and communism."

Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, especially thanked the Soviet artists for their great help to various aspects of Chinese cultural and artistic work in his speech. Obraztsov, a member of the Soviet Art Troupe, and Radinina and Cherkasov, members of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation, also spoke at the banquet. They all praised the rich artistic heritage and achievements of Chinese art work, thanked the Chinese people for their warm reception and the many gifts they gave them, and expressed their reluctance to leave China. Their moving speeches deeply immersed both guests and hosts in a harmonious and profound friendly feeling.

The banquet was conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end. During the banquet, the guests and hosts frequently toasted to the friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet peoples, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and to the health of Comrade Stalin, the teacher of the world's working people and the closest friend of the Chinese people.

After the banquet, the Opera and Dance Theater affiliated to the Central Academy of Drama performed the famous opera "The White-Haired Girl," which won the Stalin Prize, to entertain the guests.
