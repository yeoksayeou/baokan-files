    The "Pre-Assembly" Installation Method in Northeast China's Heavy Industry Construction
    Huang Kunyi
    The "pre-assembly" installation method involves systematically carrying out a series of tasks, such as counting, cleaning, disassembling, inspecting, assembling, trial installation, and test runs of equipment, before formally commencing the installation work. This is an advanced installation method from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union widely promoted this advanced installation method in the installation projects of electromechanical, metallurgical, machinery, and other industrial sectors, achieving great results. With the help of Soviet experts, Northeast China has also widely learned this method in the installation work of key projects this year. It not only ensures that the installation quality meets strict standards but also greatly improves installation efficiency, shortens the installation period, and reduces installation costs. The Twelfth Engineering Company of the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department has implemented the "pre-assembly" installation method for 40% to 70% of the equipment in two large-scale projects, Anshan 0190 and 0230, shortening the construction period by half. The Fuxin Engineering Team of the Thermal Power Engineering Company adopted the "pre-assembly" installation method in the installation project of some equipment, completing the entire project one and a half months ahead of schedule, increasing the installation efficiency by 100% and reducing the project cost by 22.8%. In addition, this installation method has also been promoted in the construction of transmission and distribution lines, achieving good results. For example, the labor required to erect a set of poles is 0.57 workdays, which is 87% lower than the quota.
    The most important advantage of the "pre-assembly" installation method is that it enables us to quickly master modern installation technology. This is of great significance to our newly started heavy industry construction work. The equipment of projects such as Angang 0190 and 0230 is very complex. In the 0190 project, tens of thousands of tons of equipment had to be installed, and nearly a million parts had to be precisely organized according to the drawings. In the past, we had never installed such equipment. How to install such complex equipment was a very important issue. Many employees felt at a loss when they received this installation task. However, under the guidance of Soviet experts, they learned the "pre-assembly" installation method, participated in practical operations such as disassembly, cleaning, assembly, trial installation, and test runs, became familiar with the installation sequence, and understood the basic operation methods of construction drawings, center lines, and templates, thereby solving the problem of not knowing how to start. However, it is impossible to quickly become familiar with this complex operation technology by using the old installation methods. By using the "pre-assembly" installation method, workers can have ample conditions to study various installation experiences and can quickly learn the advanced Soviet installation technology. For example, in the two major projects of 0190 and 0230, the hot assembly and disassembly of ball bearings and the red assembly of screws and gears were widely promoted, ensuring project quality and improving installation efficiency. When assembling and disassembling ball bearings using the hot assembly and disassembly method, the operation is easy, the efficiency can be increased by 100%, and the original precision of the ball bearings can be completely guaranteed. The use of the "pre-assembly" installation method not only improves the level of installation technology but also prepares the technical conditions for formal installation work. In the pre-assembly work of the 0190 and 0230 projects, the Twelfth Engineering Company trained 99 cadres and 400 workers who mastered modern installation technology from October last year to June this year. These cadres and workers have become the main force in the current installation work.
    Secondly, the use of the "pre-assembly" installation method has changed the old installation construction procedures, thus enabling the application of the parallel operation method in installation work. In installation work, the implementation of the parallel operation method means that on the one hand, foundation work is carried out, and on the other hand, equipment parts are inspected, counted, cleaned, disassembled, and assembled. In addition, parallel flow operations between various components can also be organized during assembly. However, when using the old installation method, the parts had to be moved to the construction site one by one for installation only after the foundation project was completed. This extended the installation period and reduced work efficiency. Especially in the installation work of blast furnaces, etc., the use of the old installation methods was not only slow but also dangerous. For example, to install a boiler with an hourly evaporation capacity of 75 tons, a 22-meter-high scaffolding had to be erected; many riveters, welders, and crane operators were needed to work at high altitudes; and thousands of steel pipes, angle irons, and I-beams had to be hoisted one by one and then installed one by one. As a result, obstacles often occurred between various work processes, and work could not be carried out simultaneously. One part had to be installed completely before the next part could be installed. The installation of such a boiler required at least 45,000 man-days. However, by using the "pre-assembly" installation method, the boiler can be divided into fourteen parts in advance while the foundation project is being done, assembled on the ground, and then hoisted up piece by piece for installation. In this way, only 20,174 man-days are required to complete the entire installation project of such a boiler. It can be seen from this that the use of the "pre-assembly" installation method not only greatly shortens the construction period but also avoids the danger of high-altitude operations.
    In the process of pre-assembly work, problems in the installation equipment can be discovered and resolved in advance due to the thorough cleaning, inspection, and correction of the installation equipment, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the installation work. In the pre-assembly work of Angang 0190 and 0230 projects, a total of 783 problems related to equipment deformation, oil pipe blockage, and parts damage were discovered successively. Because these problems could be discovered early and solved in advance, the smooth progress of the formal installation work was ensured. In the process of pre-assembly work, a set of installation management systems can be explored in advance, which is very important for carrying out large-scale and complex installation projects.
    According to the experience of various units in Northeast China, the following issues need to be paid attention to in order to do a good job in pre-assembly work: First, formulate a detailed pre-assembly work plan. The pre-assembly work plan mainly includes three parts: (1) General work plan: its content includes the equipment items and weights, indicators, and progress to be pre-assembled. (2) Monthly construction plan: The monthly plan should be submitted before the 20th of the previous month, and its content includes detailed and specific construction items, progress, construction address, responsible construction unit, specific person in charge, and labor allocation, etc. (3) Tool and material plan: The tool and material reserve plan should be formulated according to the pre-assembly construction plan; and the tool and material supply plan should be formulated according to the monthly construction plan. In addition, various construction measure plans should also be formulated. This plan should include construction drawings, technical operating procedures, quality standards, and assembly sequence diagrams.
    The formulation of the pre-assembly work plan must be very careful; and it is necessary to maintain close contact with the construction foundation engineering department, especially to organize employees to discuss the monthly construction plan and various construction measure plans, and to revise them in a timely manner according to the construction progress.
    Second, carefully arrange the construction site. When selecting the construction site for pre-assembly, transportation conditions should be considered; attention should be paid to whether there are highways and railways leading to the warehouse and the construction site; it should be ensured that electricity, water, steam, compressed air, etc. can be fully supplied; and it should also be ensured that the construction site area is of appropriate size, the environment around the construction site is clean, free of dust, the ground is flat, and it does not leak rain.
    The internal layout of the pre-assembly site is also a very important task, because the equipment for pre-assembly is very heavy machinery, especially the assembled large parts, which often weigh tens of tons. If the internal layout is not appropriate and needs to be moved, it will waste a lot of crane labor. The Fuxin Engineering Team of the Thermal Power Engineering Company found that the positions of the left and right steel beams were reversed when assembling the boiler steel beams. Therefore, they had to turn over the steel beam, which was 22 meters high, 11 meters wide, and weighed 18 tons, wasting a lot of manpower.
    Third, establish a clear responsibility system and a strict inspection system. In the process of installing mechanical equipment, it is necessary to implement a clear division of labor according to each assembly, establish a responsibility system, so that each assembly has a dedicated person responsible from counting, cleaning, trial assembly, formal installation, to acceptance and delivery.
    In the process of pre-assembly work, it must be guaranteed that the parts and assemblies meet the quality standards, otherwise, it will affect the installation work. Therefore, a strict inspection system should be established, and a dedicated person should be assigned to carry out the inspection according to the quality standards. The Fuxin Engineering Department of the Thermal Power Engineering Company established an inspection system in the pre-assembly work, so that the fourteen assemblies were smoothly assembled into a complete boiler, reaching the Soviet quality standards.
    In the process of pre-assembly work, the inspection of lifting equipment should also be strengthened. Because after adopting the "pre-assembly" installation method, cranes are used to lift assemblies weighing dozens of tons to the construction site. If the inspection of lifting equipment is not strengthened, accidents involving casualties or damage to equipment will inevitably occur.

    东北重工业建设中的“预装配”安装法
    黄坤益
    “预装配”安装法就是在正式进行安装工作之前，有计划地进行设备的清点、拆洗、检查、组合、试装、试车等一系列的工作。这是苏联先进的安装方法。苏联曾在机电、冶金、机械等工业部门的安装工程中，广泛推行了这个先进的安装方法，获得很大的效果。在苏联专家的帮助下，东北在今年重点工程的安装工作中，也普遍学习了这一方法，不但使安装质量能达到严格的标准，而且大大提高了安装效率，缩短了安装工期，降低了安装成本。东北人民政府工业部第十二工程公司在鞍山○一九○和○二三○的两个大型工程中，已有百分之四十到百分之七十的设备实行了“预装配”安装法，把工期缩短了一半。火电工程公司阜新工程队在部分设备的安装工程中，采用了“预装配”安装法，提前一个半月完成整个工程，提高了安装效率一倍，降低了工程成本百分之二十二点八。此外，在送、配电线路架设工程中，也推行了这个安装法，收到很好的效果。如立一组电杆所需的人工为零点五七工，比定额降低了百分之八十七。
    “预装配”安装法最主要的优点，是使我们迅速掌握了现代化的安装技术。这对于我们刚开始进行重工业建设工作，是有重要意义的。像鞍钢○一九○和○二三○等工程的设备，都是非常复杂的。在○一九○工程中，要安好上万吨的设备，要照着图纸精密地把近百万的零件组织起来。过去我们根本没有安装过这样的设备，如何安装这样复杂的设备，是
    一个十分重要的问题。不少职工在接到这个安装任务的时候，都感到不知如何下手。但他们在苏联专家的指导下，学习了“预装配”安装法，参加了拆洗、组合、试装、试车等实际操作，熟悉了安装顺序，懂得了施工图、中心、标板等基本操作方法，从而解决了不知如何下手的问题。但是运用旧的安装方法，是不可能迅速熟悉这种繁杂的操作技术的。运用“预装配”安装法，工人们可以有充分条件来研究各种安装的经验，可以迅速地学会苏联的先进安装技术。例如在○一九○和○二三○两大工程中，普遍推行了热装卸滚珠法和螺丝、牙轮的红装法，保证了工程质量，提高了安装效率。在用热装卸滚珠法装卸滚珠时，操作轻便，可提高效率一倍，又可以完全保证滚珠原来的精密度。运用“预装配”安装法，不但能提高安装技术水平，而且为正式安装工作准备了技术条件。第十二工程公司在○一九○和○二三○工程的预装配工作中，自去年十月至今年六月先后培养了九十九名干部和四百名掌握了现代安装技术的工人。这些干部和工人已成为目前安装工作的主要力量。
    其次，运用“预装配”安装法，改变了旧的安装施工程序，因而能把平行作业法运用到安装工作中去。在安装工作中，实行平行作业法，就是一方面进行打基础的工作，另一方面进行设备零件的检查、清点、拆洗、组合等工作，并且在装配中，还可以组织各个部件间的平行流水作业。但在运用旧的安装方法时，必须等基础工程做好以后，才把一件件的零件搬到施工地点，进行安装。这样就延长了安装工期，降低了工作效率。特别在高炉等安装工作中，运用旧的安装方法，不但慢，而且危险。例如安装一台每小时蒸发量七十五吨的锅炉，要搭起二十二公尺高的脚手架子；需要许多铆工、焊工、起重工在高空工作；需要一根一根地吊起几千根钢管、角铁、工字钢，再一根一根地安装起来，因而各工序之间常常发生障碍，不能同时进行工作，必须安完一部，然后才能安下一部。安装这样一部锅炉，至少需要四万五千个人工。但运用“预装配”安装法，就可以在做基础工程的同时，预先把锅炉部分成十四个部分，在地面上装配好，然后一片片地吊起来，进行安装。这样只要二万零一百七十四个人工，就可完成这样一部锅炉的全部安装工程。由此可见，运用“预装配”安装法，不但能大大缩短工期，而且避免了高空作业的危险。
    在预装配工作的过程中，由于对安装设备进行了彻底的清洗、检查、校正等工作，所以可以预先发现和解决安装设备中的问题，以保证安装工作顺利的进行。在鞍钢○一九○和○二三○工程的预装配工作中，先后发现了有关设备变形、油管堵塞、零件损坏等问题共七百八十三件。这些问题由于能及早发现出来，预先进行解决，因而保证了正式安装工作顺利的进行。在预装配工作的过程中，可以预先摸索出一套安装的管理制度，这对于进行大规模的复杂的安装工程，是非常重要的。
    根据东北各单位的经验，要作好预装配工作，需要注意以下几个问题：第一，制订详细的预装配工作计划。预装配工作计划主要包括三部分：（一）总工作计划：其内容包括要进行预装配的设备项目和重量、指标、进度。（二）月施工计划：在上月二十日前提出本月计划，其内容包括详细具体的施工项目、进度、施工地址、负责施工单位、具体负责人和劳动力配备等。（三）工具材料计划：工具材料的储备计划，应根据预装配施工计划来制订；而工具材料供应计划则根据月份施工计划来制订。此外，还要制订各项施工措施计划，这一计划要包括施工图、技术操作规程、质量标准和组合装配的工序指示图等。
    制订预装配工作计划，必须十分仔细；并且要和建筑基础工程的部门取得密切的联系，特别要组织职工讨论月施工计划和各项施工措施计划，并且要根据施工进度情况，及时地加以修订。
    第二，要周密地布置施工现场。在选择预装配的施工现场时，要考虑运输条件；要注意有没有公路和铁路通向仓库和施工现场；要保证电、水、蒸汽、压缩空气等能充分供应；同时还要保证工地面积大小适当，工地四周的环境要清洁，没有尘土，地面要平坦，不漏雨。
    预装配现场的内部布置，也是一项很重要的工作，因为进行预装配的设备都是一些十分笨重的机件，特别是组合成的大件，往往重达数十吨。如果内部布置不恰当，需要搬动，就要浪费许多起重工。火电工程公司阜新工程队在组合锅炉钢梁时，曾发现左右侧钢梁位置颠倒，因此不得不将高二十二公尺、宽十一公尺、重达十八吨的钢梁翻过身来，浪费了许多人力。
    第三，要建立明确的责任制度和严格的检查制度。在安装机械设备的过程中，必须根据每一个组合体，实行明确的分工，建立责任制度，使各个组合体从清点、拆洗、试装、正式安装，一直到验收交工为止，都有专人负责。
    在预装配工作的过程中，必须保证零件和组合体合乎质量的标准，否则就会影响安装工作，因此应该建立严格的检查制度，确定专人按照质量的标准，来进行检查。火电工程公司阜新工程处在预装配工作中，建立了检查制度，使十四个组合体顺利地组合成一个完整的锅炉，达到了苏联的质量标准。
    在预装配工作的过程中，还应加强对起重设备的检查。因为在采用了“预装配”安装法之后，要用起重机把几十吨重的组合体吊到施工地点，如果不加强对起重设备的检查，就难免不发生伤亡或损坏设备的事故。
