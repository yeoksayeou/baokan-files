To the Editor:

In 1951, our department built new barracks and warehouses in a certain location, contracted to the Shijiazhuang City Public Xing Shi Construction Company. During the construction, this company failed to fulfill the contract and drawing requirements, blatantly stealing materials and skimping on workmanship, even resorting to despicable methods such as bribing supervising personnel with gifts and dinners. More seriously, it subcontracted the project to foremen at low prices, subjecting workers to exploitation by feudal foremen. This caused extreme resentment among the workers and greatly affected the quality and progress of the project, extending the completion date by 100 days. In the company's so-called "project summary," it had to admit: "...The contradictions between the company and the foremen increased the difficulty of the project and became the main reason for the delay..." This caused many military transport vehicles and equipment to be placed in the open for a long time, failing to enter the warehouse according to our department's original plan, resulting in incalculable losses. Based on preliminary calculations of the stealing of materials and skimping on workmanship for the entire project alone, it amounted to over 900 million yuan; and with a delay of 100 days, calculated at 40 percent of the value of part of the project, the fine should be more than 2.35 billion yuan.

During the "Three-Anti" movement, our department conducted a preliminary inspection of the above-mentioned stealing of materials and skimping on workmanship, and in early March 1952, specifically filed a complaint with the Central Committee for Economy and Thrift Inspection, which was transferred to the Shijiazhuang City Committee for Economy and Thrift Inspection for handling, but so far there has been no news. Our department's complaint clearly pointed out that the newly built project had reached a dangerous degree of "inevitable collapse in the event of a storm" due to the stealing of materials and skimping on workmanship, but this did not attract the attention of the relevant authorities of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government. On July 7, 1952, a wind and hail storm caused the project to collapse, resulting in a loss of more than 290 million yuan. According to the contract: "During the warranty period, if the collapse or leakage is due to poor construction, the contractor (the company) shall be responsible for repairs." Our department has repeatedly sent people to negotiate with Xing Shi Company to resolve the matter, but the company has repeatedly made excuses and refused to meet, refusing to repair. The current manager, Niu Lishi, had no choice but to meet, and deliberately emphasized objective reasons, fabricating it as "this time it was a natural disaster that could not be resisted by human power," attempting to evade responsibility. In our series of questions, Niu was speechless and finally said stubbornly: "We will repair if the Central Committee approves it, otherwise we will not repair it." Our department really could not resolve the matter and filed a complaint with the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court on July 17. The engineering inspection team organized by the court conducted an on-site inspection of the building and proved that the accusation of stealing materials and skimping on workmanship was completely factual. The Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court should handle the matter seriously in accordance with the spirit of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. However, the court's conciliation record No. 276 (Criminal) of August 11 and the judgment No. 356 (Criminal) of November 11 did not mention how to deal with Xing Shi Company's criminal behavior of stealing materials and skimping on workmanship in national defense construction projects. It was just full of words like "replacement," "inspection," and "repair," and even openly exonerated and defended this criminal behavior. For example, the collapse of the wall was mainly caused by the stealing of materials and skimping on workmanship, but the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court ruled: "...It is because the contractor's construction was not thorough, and should make a deep self-criticism..." We believe: "Construction not being thorough" is stealing materials and skimping on workmanship. After causing huge losses to national defense construction due to stealing materials and skimping on workmanship, is it only "should make a deep self-criticism"? Then, what role has the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court played in ensuring economic recovery and national construction? Is it tolerable that Xing Shi Construction Company caused such huge losses to the country? For example, in the matter of late fines, the judgment tried its best to support Xing Shi Company's so-called "reasons" that were not worth refuting, but had to admit:
	"The contractor did complete the project late, so a fine of 15 percent of the total value of the second contract is imposed at the discretion of the court." What is the basis for fining 15 percent according to the second contract? It is not difficult to understand, because the total value of the first contract is a huge number.
From the above problems, it can be fully seen that the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court is dealing with such cases of stealing materials and skimping on workmanship by construction factories from the perspective of conciliation and openly protecting capitalist management ideas, rather than handling it seriously, fairly, and reasonably from the standpoint of safeguarding national interests. Therefore, our department has declared an appeal to the Hebei Provincial People's Court, and at the same time, we are revealing the case to you to attract the attention of the relevant government departments, investigate the reasons, hold responsibility, and make a public self-criticism in the People's Daily.

### 石家庄市兴石建筑公司偷工减料案件应严肃处理

    石家庄市兴石建筑公司偷工减料案件应严肃处理
    编辑同志：一九五一年我部在某地新建营房、仓库若干，由石家庄市公营兴石建筑公司承包。该公司在施工中不履行合同及图纸规定，大肆偷工减料，甚至卑鄙地以送礼、请客等方式行贿监工人员，更严重的是又将工程低价转包给把头，使工人遭受封建把头的剥削。这曾引起工人们的极度愤恨，并大大影响了工程质量和进度，延长完工期限一百天之久。在该公司的所谓“工程总结”中也不得不承认：“……公司与把头之间的矛盾，增加了工程进行的困难，并成了工程误期的主要原因……”这使许多军事运输工具、器材长期置于露天，不能按我部原订计划入库，损失无法计算。仅以全部工程的偷工减料初步计算，即达九亿多元；又逾期一百天，按部分工程价值的百分之四十计算，即应罚款二十三亿五千多万元。
    “三反”运动中，我部对上述偷工减料行为，作了初步检查后，于一九五二年三月初旬具体地向中央节约检查委员会提出控告，并转由石家庄市节约检查委员会办理，但至今毫无音信。我部的控告书中已明确指出，新建工程因偷工减料已达“一经暴风雨势必坍塌”的危险程度，而并未引起石家庄市人民政府有关机关的重视。一九五二年七月七日一场风雹，工程倒塌，损失达二亿九千多万元。根据合同规定：“在保固期内，如因工程不良，以致坍漏由乙方（该公司）负责修建。”我部曾多次派人找兴石公司洽商解决，但该公司屡次推诿不见，拒绝修建。现任经理牛力士不得不见了，还故意强调客观原因，捏造为“这次是人力不可抗拒之天灾”，企图推卸责任。在我们一系列的质问中，牛无言可答，最后，竟蛮横地讲：“中央批准我们就修，否则不修。”我部实在无法解决，于七月十七日向石家庄市人民法院提起控告。法院组织的工程检查组到建筑物所在地进行了实地检查，证明偷工减料的指控完全是事实。石家庄市人民法院应根据“三反”“五反”运动的精神，严肃处理。但该院在八月十一日刑字第二七六号的和解笔录及十一月十一日刑字第三五六号的判决书中却根本没谈到兴石公司对国防建筑工程偷工减料的犯罪行为应如何处理。只是满篇“另行更换”、“检修”、“修补”等词，甚至公开替这种犯罪行为作开脱与辩护。如：围墙的倒塌，偷工减料是主要原因之一，而石家庄市人民法院却判为：“……系乙方施工不周，应作深刻检讨……。”我们认为：“施工不周”就是偷工减料，因偷工减料而使国防建设遭受巨大损失之后，只“应作深刻检讨”吗？那么，石家庄市人民法院在保证经济恢复工作和国家各项建设事业上都起到了那些作用呢？兴石建筑公司这样给国家造成的巨大损失，难道是可以令人容忍的吗？又如：延期罚款一事，判决书中极力支持了兴石公司提出的不值一驳的所谓“理由”，但也不得不承认：
    “乙方确系延期完工，故酌情按第二次所订合同工程总值处罚金百分之十五。”按第二个合同处罚金百分之十五是依据什么呢？不难理解，因第一个合同总值数字巨大。
    由以上问题充分看出，石家庄市人民法院处理这样的营造厂偷工减料案件，是以调和观点、公开庇护资本主义的经营观点出发，而不是站在维护国家利益的立场上作严肃又公正合理的处理。因此，我部已声明上诉河北省人民法院，同时将案情揭发出来告诉你们，以引起政府有关部门的高度重视，检查原因，追究责任，并在人民日报上作公开的检讨。
