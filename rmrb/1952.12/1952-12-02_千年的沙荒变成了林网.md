    Millennia of Sandy Wasteland Transformed into a Forest Network
    Jin Yu
    South of Gujun Village in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, the hometown of afforestation model worker Jia Lanhua, lies a 3,000-plus mu protective forest network connected to Hege Village. This marks the starting point for the comprehensive construction of protective forest networks in the three major sandy wastelands of western Hebei—Shendao Beach, the old course of the Laoci River, and the breach embankment of the Sha River—since 1949 by the people of western Hebei. The protective forest network extends southward from here to Citing Village in Zhengding County, and southeastward across the entire Xinle County, reaching Gaocheng and Wuji counties. The total area is more than 84,800 mu.
    The three major sandy wastelands used to be barren, but their appearance has begun to change. The sandy beaches where nothing grew in the past are now covered with forest networks woven from small trees. Standing on the high ground or dunes at the edge of the village and looking into the distance, one can see countless lush rows of trees dividing the land into numerous squares. According to Wang Bo, deputy director of the Western Hebei Afforestation Experimental Farm, the construction of protective forest networks in the sandy wasteland is based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building protective forest networks, and has been explored and implemented according to local conditions. Each grid of this forest network has an area of one hectare. These rectangular grids are divided by countless intersecting forest belts. The forest belts are composed of four rows of arbors (Populus simonii, Sophora japonica, etc.) and two rows of shrubs (Amorpha fruticosa, Lespedeza bicolor, etc.). In order to strengthen the protection effect, many forest belts composed of ten to twenty rows of arbors and shrubs also traverse the forest network. Taking the train from Beijing to Shijiazhuang, not far from the Dongchangshou Station, people can see a shady row of trees on the west side of the railway, which is one of the many forest belts here. Like other forest belts protecting farmland, it has gradually played its due role. In the past, this section of the roadbed was subject to wind and sand erosion every spring, and the rails were often buried in sand. Since last year, because this forest belt has been closed into a forest, this section of the roadbed has no longer been eroded by wind and sand.
    Like this section of the roadbed, many cultivated lands in the sandy area have been protected by forest belts and forest networks. Some of the semi-utilized land that suffered from wind disasters every spring has now become fertile irrigated land; the sandy wasteland that used to only sparsely grow arrow grass has seen a small number of trials of planting white beans and buckwheat this year. Huangjiazhuang in Xinle County, located in the center of the sandy wasteland, used to be a village suffering from wind and sand damage for a long time. Many cultivated lands in this village were gradually eroded by sand and turned into sandy wasteland, and many wells were filled with quicksand and could not be used. It was also very difficult to sow seeds on the temporarily cultivatable land in the spring when wind and sand were rampant. Now, with the gradual growth of trees in the protective forest network and field protection forests, the natural conditions of this village are very different. Wang Shouyi, a farmer in this village, harvested only three dou of miscellaneous grains per mu in the autumn of 1949 on a piece of land south of the village. Last year, the average yield increased to more than one shi, and this year it continued to increase to two shi. With the reduction of wind damage and the improvement of soil quality, his land, which could not grow wheat in the past, has been able to grow wheat since last year. He planted twelve mu of wheat last autumn, and the harvest was good. This year he plans to plant nine more mu. Many lands that could only be planted for one season in the past can now be planted for two seasons.
    Why has the barren land with a small yield per unit area in the past become fertile land that can be planted for two seasons after planting protective forests? Wang Shouyi said: Every spring, the wind blows for one or two months, and the land cannot be sown smoothly without the protection of trees. Sometimes the seeds sown in the ground are blown away by the wind. Sometimes the seeds are buried by the sand blown by the wind. In the past, it was common to sow three or four times for one season of crops in this area. At the same time, because of wind and sand erosion, the grown crops are also prone to drought or being buried by sand, so naturally, a good harvest cannot be obtained.
    In 1949, when the cadres of the people's government mobilized the masses to build large-scale protective forest networks here, some people were not confident in this work. Some people thought: We have never heard of planting trees in white sand from our ancestors. They believed that transforming the sandy wasteland was beyond human capabilities. Some people thought: A few trees can be planted alive at the edge of the village, but who can stop the children who pick firewood and graze cattle from ruining them. Since the protective forest network has gradually grown and the natural appearance of this area has begun to change, people have realized the great significance of building protective forests from their own experience. Afforestation work has become a conscious action of the masses in this area. Three years ago, most of the saplings for building protective forest networks in this area were supplied by the government. Now the situation is different. According to statistics from the Western Hebei Forestry Experimental Farm, the masses in only fifty villages in six counties, including Xinle, have cultivated more than 340 mu of saplings this year, producing no less than four million saplings. In the past, people would not take care of the trees after planting them, but now the members of the forestry cooperatives automatically protect and nurture the trees. Many afforestation cooperatives in Wuji County have automatically implemented "sealing off the beaches to protect forests" since last year. The destruction of trees has basically disappeared.
    Through large-scale cooperative afforestation, the collectivist concept of the farmers in western Hebei has been strengthened. The people in the three major sandy areas of western Hebei have organized more than 250 forestry cooperatives. On average, more than 95% of the farmers in the villages in the sandy area have joined the forestry cooperatives. Many members of the forestry cooperatives have initially realized the benefits of being organized from cooperative afforestation. Under the condition that protective forests grow and natural conditions gradually change, they have begun to demand the organization of production mutual aid and cooperation organizations that combine agriculture and forestry. A small number of forestry cooperatives have implemented the method of combining agriculture and forestry. Guo Zhigong Afforestation Cooperative in Gaoling Village, Wuji County, was reorganized into an agricultural and forestry mutual aid group in March this year. The members of Sun Luoyong and other seven households' forestry cooperative in Huangjiazhuang also formed an agricultural and forestry mutual aid group in the spring of this year.
    In order to further develop production, the farmers here are constantly creating new production conditions. Many farmers have begun to cultivate fruit tree seedlings and pre-purchase fruit tree seedlings from forest farms, preparing to develop orchards on a large scale in the future.
    The three major sandy wastelands in western Hebei have a long history of harming the people. Shendao Beach, one of the three major sandy wastelands, was formed as early as a thousand years ago, according to the records of the local temple stele. In the past, the farmers in this area always believed that the sandy wasteland could not be conquered. They often said: "Whoever can conquer the wind and sand, we will build a temple for him." But now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they have found a way to conquer the wind and sand, and have begun to change the appearance of the sandy wasteland with their own hands.

    千年的沙荒变成了林网
    近宇
    造林模范贾兰虎的家乡——河北省行唐县故郡村的南面，有一片跟合河村相连的面积有三千多亩的防护林网。这是冀西人民从一九四九年起，在冀西三大沙荒——神道滩、老磁河故道和沙河破堤滩全面营造防护林网的起点。防护林网由这里向南伸展到正定县的慈亭村，向东南横贯新乐全县直到藁城、无极两县。总面积是八万四千八百多亩。
    过去的三大沙荒是一片荒凉，现在它的面貌已开始改观了。过去不长植物的沙滩，现在布满了用小树织成的林网。站在村边的高处或沙丘上向远处眺望，就会看见无数繁茂的树行，把大地划成无数的方格。据冀西造林实验场的王波副场长说，在沙荒中营造防护林网，是采用苏联营造防护林网的先进经验，根据当地的具体情况，摸索着作的。这种林网的每个网格的面积是一公顷。这些长方形的格子是由纵横交错的无数条林带所区划的。林带是用四行乔木（小叶杨、杨槐等）、两行灌木（紫穗槐、胡枝子等）组成的。为了加强防护的效果，在林网中还横亘着许多条以十行到二十行乔木和灌木造成的林带。从北京坐火车到石家庄，在东长寿车站不远的地方，人们可以看到铁路西侧一条成荫的树行，那就是这里的许多条林带中的一条。它和其他防护农田的林带一样，已经逐渐发挥了应有的作用。以前这段路基每年春季都要受到风沙的侵袭，路轨时常被沙子埋住。从去年起，因为这条林带已经郁闭成林，这段路基已经不再受风沙的侵袭了。
    沙荒地区的许多耕地和这段路基一样，由于有林带和林网的保护，以前每年春季遭受风灾的半利用地，现在一部分已经变成肥沃的水浇地了；以前只稀稀落落地长些箭草的沙荒，今年已有少数开始试种白豆和荞麦了。座落在沙荒中心的新乐县的黄家庄，过去是一个长期遭受风沙之害的村庄。这个村庄有许多耕地逐渐被沙子侵蚀变成了沙荒，许多水井被流沙填塞不能使用。部分暂时可耕的土地，在每年春天风沙猖獗的时候播种也是很困难的。现在，防护林网和护田林的树木逐渐成长起来，这个村庄的自然条件就大大不同了。这个村的农民王守义在村南的一块地，一九四九年秋每亩地只收了三斗多杂粮，去年平均产量提高到一石多，今年又继续提高到两石。随着风害的减轻，土质的改良，他的以前不能种麦子的地，从去年起已能种麦子了。他去年秋天种了十二亩麦子，收成还好，今年准备多种九亩。许多以前只能种一季的地，现在也能种两季了。
    为什么以前单位面积产量小的瘠薄地，在种植防护林以后就变成能种两季的肥沃土地了呢？王守义说：每年春天要刮一两个月的风，土地没有树木保护，就不能顺利播种。有时播在地里的种子被风刮跑了。有时种子被风刮来的沙子掩埋了。过去这一带，一季庄稼播种三四次是常事。同时因为风沙侵袭，成长起来的庄稼也容易遭受干旱，或被沙子埋没，这样自然就得不到好收成。
    一九四九年人民政府的干部在这里发动群众大规模营造防护林网时，部分群众对这种工作没有信心，有的认为：从老辈子就没有听说过，白花花的沙子里可以种树。他们认为改造沙荒不是人力所能办得到的。有的认为：在村边地头上可以栽活几棵树，但是谁能阻挡住拾柴、放牛的孩子糟踏呢。自从防护林网逐渐成长，这一带的自然面貌开始改变以后，人们已经从亲身体验里认识了营造防护林的伟大意义。造林工作已经成为这一带群众的自觉行动了。三年以前，在这一带营造防护林网的大部树苗是由政府供给的，现在的情况已经不同了。据冀西林业实验场统计，今年只新乐等六县五十个村的群众，就培育了三百四十多亩树苗，所产的苗木不下四百万株。在以前群众种上树以后就不去管了，现在林业合作社的社员们自动地保护和抚育林木了。无极县许多造林合作社由去年起已自动实行“封滩护林”。破坏林木的事情已经基本上绝迹了。
    通过大规模的合作造林，冀西农民的集体主义的观念加强了。冀西三大沙荒地区的人民已经组织了二百五十多个林业合作社，沙荒区各村的农户平均有百分之九十五以上都加入了林业合作社。许多林业合作社的社员从合作造林中初步体会到了组织起来的好处。他们在防护林生长起来，自然条件逐渐改变的情况下，开始要求组织农林结合的生产互助合作组织。已有少数的林业合作社实行了农林结合的办法。无极县高陵村郭志公造林合作社就是在今年三月改组成农林互助组的。黄家庄孙洛勇等七户林业合作社的社员也在今年春天合组成一个农林互助组。
    为了进一步发展生产，这里的农民还在不断地创造新的生产条件。许多农民已开始培育果树苗，向林场预购果树苗，准备今后大量发展果园。
    冀西的三大沙荒，为害人民是有长久历史的。三大沙荒之一的神道滩，根据当地庙碑的记载，是远在一千年以前就形成了。过去这一带的农民，一向认为沙荒是没有办法征服的。他们常说：“谁能够征服风沙，我们就给谁修庙。”但是现在在共产党、人民政府的领导下，他们已经找到了征服风沙的办法，用自己的手开始改变了沙荒的面貌。
