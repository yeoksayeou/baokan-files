The "Dou Duanxiao Incident" has caused immense indignation and heartache among our readers. Readers from all over the country have written to this newspaper to express their opinions and demand that the Yunnan provincial Party and government leading organs promptly and seriously handle this incident. On the afternoon of December 10th – the day the "Reader's Letters Page" published the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" – we received letters from several readers. As of December 15th, we have received a total of 635 letters from readers and 11 letters from units, totaling 105 pieces. The reading group of the production section of the Beijing Machine Factory and all students of the Beijing College of Political Science and Law discussed this matter and unanimously requested to write to this newspaper to express their opinions. People's Navy soldier Gao Feng and 350 others wrote saying that they were extremely angry upon learning about this incident and specially bought paper and pens to write to this newspaper. The Liu family from Nian'er Hutong in Beijing wrote: "After reading the newspaper, our whole family was very indignant and could not calm down for a long time. Everyone said they wanted to write a letter to the newspaper to express what was on our minds." Xing Lianzhong, a security guard from the China Animal Husbandry Company, wrote that he could only read newspapers and was not very good at writing; but hatred drove him to complete his letter.

All readers pointed out in their letters that the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" illustrates how insidious and malicious unrepentant counter-revolutionaries are in exploiting every possibility to attack the people. The people of the whole country should learn a lesson from the "Dou Duanxiao Incident," redouble their revolutionary vigilance, and ruthlessly suppress the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries. Ji Susheng and four other third-year students from the Department of Law of the Renmin University of China, as well as Xue Geng and Zhang Rungui from the Qunxing Bristle Processing Factory in Xingji Town, Cangxian Special District, specifically stated in their letters: "As the large-scale economic construction of the motherland is about to begin, we must be even more vigilant and strictly prevent the enemy's destructive activities to ensure that our construction cause is not damaged." Zhao Lianchen and seven others from the Xisi Sub-bureau of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, and Wang Ruiqing and others from the guard company of the Civil Aviation Administration, have all written to assure that they will do a better job in security work in the future and resolutely safeguard the interests of the people. Zhang Jialin, a student at the Beijing College of Political Science and Law, wrote to assure that she would study hard, improve her political understanding, and work better in the future to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguard the interests of the people. Readers unanimously believe that the counter-revolutionary Luo Shilin, who cruelly murdered Comrade Dou Duanxiao, is guilty of heinous crimes and must be sentenced to death to avenge Comrade Dou Duanxiao.

Readers feel very pained by the serious loss of class stand exhibited by the likes of Mu Meisheng, secretary of the Luxi County Party Committee, who sat idly by and watched as revolutionary cadres were brutally murdered. Four comrades, including Meng Yunsheng, from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote: "Why did revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and lives? Why are the volunteers fighting heroically on the Korean front? Why are the People's Liberation Army vigilantly holding their weapons? Why are the workers and peasants working selflessly? Why? In a word, isn't it all for the benefit of the people of the motherland. But Mu Meisheng and others are cadres of the country, servants of the people, have they completely forgotten the interests of the people?" Readers also pointed out: Those who once offered correct opinions to Mu Meisheng but did not dare to persist are all good comrades; however, they should strengthen their principles. Many readers have learned from this and are determined to strengthen their political study, arm themselves with revolutionary thought, and adhere to principled struggle at all times and in all places. Reader Liu Yuanmou wrote that he would care for the interests of the people in the future as if they were his own eyes.

Many readers believe that Mu Meisheng has completely lost the qualities that a Communist Party member should possess and has committed an unforgivable crime against the people. They suggest that the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China expel Mu Meisheng from the Party and that the Yunnan Provincial People's Government give Mu Meisheng criminal punishment. Other derelict cadres, such as Yang Chujiang, chief of the health section of the Yiliang Special District, Shao Guanghua, president of the Luxi County People's Court, and Wang Ming, chief of the personnel section of the Luxi County People's Government, should also be punished to a certain extent.

Comrade Dou Duanxiao demonstrated her excellent qualities by fighting unyieldingly against counter-revolutionaries. In addition to expressing regret and grief over her murder, many readers also proposed to learn from her fighting spirit. Reader Lin Jia'ao suggested that the Yunnan Provincial Youth League organization posthumously recognize Dou Duanxiao as a member of the Youth League.

We believe that the "Dou Duanxiao" incident has given us a painful lesson. The broad masses of readers have not only accepted the lesson from this incident, but also put forward opinions on the handling of the incident in the capacity of masters of the country, which is entirely appropriate. The Party and government leading organs of Yunnan Province should attach importance to the opinions of the masses. The counter-revolutionary Luo Shilin is responsible for causing the incident, and the readers' demand for him to be sentenced to death according to law is correct. As for the punishment of the relevant derelict personnel in this incident – certain Party and government leading cadres in Luxi County, especially County Party Secretary Mu Meisheng – it should be handled seriously, solemnly, and cautiously. It should be pointed out that the nature of the mistakes made by Mu Meisheng in this incident is serious; but when giving punishment, a comprehensive consideration must be made – Mu Meisheng's consistent performance in his work should be considered, as well as Mu Meisheng's understanding and degree of correction of his mistakes. Only in this way can the punishment decided be correct.

    “窦端孝事件”引起广大群众的激愤
    六百多个读者给本报来信要求严惩凶犯
    “窦端孝事件”使广大读者感到无比的激愤和痛心。各地读者纷纷给本报来信，表示他们的意见，并要求云南省党政领导机关迅速严正处理这一事件。在十二月十日——“读者来信专页”发表“窦端孝事件”的当天下午，我们就接到了几位读者的来信。到十二月十五日为止，我们已先后收到六百三十五个读者和十一个单位的来信共一百零五件。北京机器厂生产科读报组和北京政法学院全体学生等讨论了这件事，一致要求写信给本报表示意见。人民海军战士高峰等三百五十人来信说：他们知道了这个事件，气极了，特地买了纸和笔写信给本报。北京辇儿胡同刘家来信说：“读完了报纸，我们全家激愤得很久不能安静下去。大家都说要写一封信给报社，说说我们心里的话。”中国畜产公司警卫员邢连仲来信说：他只会看报，还不太会写字；但是愤恨推动着他写完了他的来信。
    所有读者在来信中都指出：“窦端孝事件”说明怙恶不悛的反革命分子是怎样阴险毒辣地利用一切可能来向人民进攻。全国人民都应该从“窦端孝事件”中取得教训，百倍提高革命警惕性，无情地镇压反革命分子的破坏活动。中国人民大学法律系三年级学生吉苏生等四人和沧县专区企业公司兴济镇群兴猪鬃加工厂薛耕、张润桂等在来信中特别提出：“在祖国大规模经济建设即将开始的时候，我们必须更加提高警惕，严防敌人的破坏活动，以保证我们的建设事业不受损失。”北京市公安局西四分局赵连臣等七人、民航局警卫连王瑞庆等都来信保证今后要把保卫工作做得更好，坚决保卫人民的利益。北京政法学院学生章嘉琳来信保证努力学习，提高政治水平，将来更好地为巩固人民民主专政、保卫人民利益而工作。读者一致认为：残害窦端孝同志的反革命分子罗时霖罪大恶极，令人发指，必须处以极刑，为窦端孝同志报仇。
    读者对泸西县县委书记牟梅生等坐视革命干部惨遭杀害的这种严重丧失阶级立场的行为，感到十分痛心。中国人民解放军某部孟云升等四同志来信说：“革命烈士为什么献出自己的鲜血和生命？志愿军为什么在朝鲜前线英勇奋战？解放军为什么警惕地握紧着武器？工人、农民为什么忘我地劳动着？为什么？一句话，还不是为了祖国人民的利益。但牟梅生等是国家的干部、人民的勤务员，他们难道完全忘记了人民的利益了吗？”读者又指出：那些曾经向牟梅生提出正确意见，但不敢坚持的，都是好同志；不过他们还应该加强自己的原则性。很多读者从这里得到了教育，决心加强政治学习，用革命的思想武装自己，随时随地坚持原则性的斗争。读者刘源谋来信说：他今后要关心人民的利益，像关心自己的眼珠一样。
    不少读者认为：牟梅生已经完全丧失了一个共产党员应有的品质，对人民犯了不可饶恕的罪。他们建议中共云南省委开除牟梅生的党籍，建议云南省人民政府给牟梅生以刑事处分。其他失职干部，像宜良专署卫生科长杨楚江、泸西县人民法院院长邵光华、泸西县人民政府人事科长王明等也应该受到一定处分。
    窦端孝同志坚贞不屈地和反革命分子斗争，表现了她的优秀品质。很多读者除了对她的被害表示惋惜悲痛外，还提出要学习她的斗争精神。读者林甲鳌建议云南省青年团组织追认窦端孝为青年团员。
    我们认为：“窦端孝”事件给予我们的教训是沉痛的。广大读者从这一事件中不仅接受了教训，而且以主人翁的身分提出对事件处理的意见，这是完全应该的。云南省党、政领导机关应该重视群众的意见。反革命分子罗时霖是造成事件的责任者，读者要求依法处以极刑是正确的。至于对这一事件有关的失职人员——滤西县某些党政领导干部，特别是县委书记牟梅生的处分问题，则应认真、严肃、慎重地处理。应该指出：牟梅生在这一事件中所犯错误的性质是严重的；但在给予处分时，则必须全面考虑——要考虑牟梅生在工作中的一贯表现，也要考虑牟梅生对错误的认识和改正程度。只有这样，所决定的处分才能正确。
