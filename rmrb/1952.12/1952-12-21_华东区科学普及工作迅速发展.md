The science popularization work in the East China region has developed rapidly. The China Association for Science and Technology Popularization has established eight branches in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Shandong, as well as twenty-eight branch associations in medium and small cities, with a total of more than six thousand members. In the past two years, the branches have organized more than 10,000 popular science lectures, screened 2,500 science slide shows, and held 300 science exhibitions, educating a total of 5.5 million people. These efforts have played an important role in improving the scientific knowledge of the working people and promoting industrial and agricultural production in various regions. Popular science pamphlets on agriculture published by the Association for Science and Technology Popularization have been widely circulated in the vast rural areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces. More than 30,000 copies of the pamphlet on sericulture have been sold in Zhejiang Province alone. In the suburbs of Tunxi City, Anhui Province, more than ten kinds of pests, such as rice casebearers, leaf beetles, rice borers, and spiders, were discovered last year and this year. Local farmers lacked agricultural scientific knowledge and believed that they were "divine insects that fell from the sky, and could not be caught; the more you catch, the more there will be." The Tunxi City Association for Science and Technology Popularization used slide shows, cartoons, exhibitions, and other forms to focus on publicizing the origin and harm of pests to farmers, breaking the farmers' superstitions. These pests were finally quickly eradicated in the area.

To meet the needs of the upcoming large-scale national construction, the headquarters of the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization held a work reporting meeting of the provincial and municipal branches in the East China region in Shanghai from the 9th to the 13th to understand the progress of science popularization work in the East China region, and focused on organizing representatives of various branches to discuss how science popularization work could further serve national construction in the coming year. The meeting tentatively determined that in 1953, another 10,000 members should be developed in the East China region, and the workload should be expanded to one to two times the current scale. The meeting criticized the tendency of some branches to rely solely on full-time cadres and active members. The meeting emphasized that work groups should be mobilized to carry out their work independently and proactively, while vigorously assisting and promoting other mass organizations and relevant government departments to carry out science popularization work. The meeting believed that a large number of work groups and work bases should be established in factories, hospitals, schools, and government organs, and that the number of work groups should be expanded from the current 79 to 345 and 416 work bases should be established in 1953, so that science popularization work could be more extensive and in-depth.

    华东区科学普及工作迅速发展
    华东区科学普及工作迅速发展。中华全国科学技术普及协会已建立了上海、浙江、福建、安徽、山东等八个分会及二十八个中等以下城市的支会，共有会员六千多人。两年中，各分会共主办通俗科学演讲一万多次，放映科学幻灯片二千五百次，举办科学展览会三百次，受到教育的群众共有五百五十万人。这些工作，在提高各地劳动人民的科学知识和推动工农业生产方面，起了重要作用。科学技术普及协会印行的通俗农业科学小册子，已在福建、浙江、山东等省广大农村中普遍流传。关于养蚕的小册子，仅在浙江一省就销行三万多份。在安徽省屯溪市郊区，去年和今年先后发现稻苞虫、负泥虫、螟蛉、蜘蛛等十多种害虫。当地农民缺乏农业科学知识，认为是“天上掉下来的神虫，不能捉，越捉越多。”屯溪市科学技术普及协会利用幻灯、漫画、展览会等形式，集中地向农民宣传害虫的来源和危害，破除了农民的迷信。该地这些害虫终于被迅速扑灭。
    为适应即将到来的国家大规模建设的需要，中华全国科学技术普及协会总会九日到十三日在上海召开了华东区各省、市分会工作汇报会议，了解科学普及工作在华东区进行的情况，并着重地组织各分会代表讨论了明年科学普及工作如何进一步为国家建设服务的问题。会议初步确定：一九五三年应在华东地区再发展会员一万人，并将工作量扩大到现有规模的一倍到两倍。会议对一些分会所发生的单纯依靠专职干部和单纯使用会员积极分子的偏向，进行了批判。会议着重指出：应发动工作组自主自动地进行工作，同时大力协助和推动其他群众团体和政府有关部门进行科学普及工作。会议认为应在工厂、医院、学校、机关中大量建立工作组和工作据点，一九五三年内将工作组由现在的七十九个扩大到三百四十五个，并建立四百十六个工作据点，以便使科学普及工作更为广泛和深入。（新华社）
