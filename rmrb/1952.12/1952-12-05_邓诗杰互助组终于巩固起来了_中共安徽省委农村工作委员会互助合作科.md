    Deng Shijie's Mutual Aid Team is Finally Consolidated
    Mutual Aid and Cooperation Section, Rural Work Committee of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The Deng Shijie Mutual Aid Team in Changli Village, Denglou Township, Guoyang County, Anhui Province, is one of the more outstanding mutual aid teams in the entire county. This mutual aid team was organized in March 1950 during the production campaign to overcome famine. It disbanded three times, but was finally consolidated and developed. Now the team has twelve households, including ten poor peasant households and two middle peasant households. After three years of mutual aid production, all team members have improved their lives and increased their patriotic enthusiasm. In addition to cultivating their own land, the entire team also rents twelve mu of public land, using the grain harvested from the public land as public accumulation funds.

    Team leader Deng Shijie is a simple farmer of 37 years, from a poor peasant background. Before liberation, he pulled carts, fled from famine, and begged for food, suffering a lot. After liberation, he worked actively and was elected as the village chief. He is now a township public security officer. In the past two years, he has been elected as a first-class labor model and high-yield model of the district and county for three times. Farmers from far and near admire him and the mutual aid team he leads, often coming in groups from thirty to fifty miles away to learn from them.

    I. Three Failures

    The development process of the Deng Shijie Mutual Aid Team was very tortuous. In March 1950, Township Chief Han Hongyan issued a notice requiring the entire village to form mutual aid teams within three days. Liu Zhengding, the chairman of the farmers' association, and Liu Zhengbang, the finance and grain officer, used the household registration books to divide the village's 106 households into eleven teams. Deng Shijie was assigned to the Deng Shibin team. At that time, people looked at each other, not knowing what the organization of a mutual aid team was all about. When working, seven or eight people would go to the fields together and rest together. When the cadres came, everyone would work together, but when the cadres left, they would manage their own affairs. They worked together like this for three months, wasting a lot of work. Deng Shilin, fearing losses, quietly sold his livestock. After the wheat harvest, the mutual aid team collapsed.

    Two months later, when the sorghum turned red and could be cut soon, the People's Government called for the restoration of the old mutual aid teams and the organization of new ones to welcome the autumn harvest. Everyone felt that the previous forced organization had failed, and this time they had to find their own "partners." After two nights of meetings, some said, "It's better to deal with the familiar," so they decided to stick with the old crowd! After everyone agreed, the original team reorganized the mutual aid team. During the autumn harvest, the team's six large and small livestock were too busy. Households with cattle had priority in using them, while households without cattle could not thresh. Li Qingcai finished threshing five days later than others, and failed to sow wheat. In August, there was no rain for a month, and in early September, it rained for nineteen days, delaying sowing. As soon as the weather cleared, everyone scrambled to plow the fields. Deng Shibin and Li Guangcai forcibly pulled Deng Shikui's cattle (a middle peasant) to plow the fields. Deng Shikui was so angry that he complained everywhere, saying, "The mutual aid team is exploiting people." Several households with cattle were worried that "mutual aid" would kill their cattle. With the cattle labor problem unresolved, the mutual aid team disbanded again.

    In March 1951, the Huai River harnessing project began, and the village mobilized a large number of people to go to the embankments. Everyone was worried that production would be delayed due to the Huai River harnessing. At that time, Deng Shijie was the deputy director of the township farmers' association. He seized this opportunity and persuaded the original team members to restore the mutual aid team. Everyone elected Deng Shijie as the team leader and Li Qingcai as the deputy team leader, and implemented work recording and accounting. Everyone stipulated that each full labor force and each livestock labor day would be recorded as ten work points, and half a labor force would be recorded as six work points. At first, they carried account books and pens to the fields every day to record accounts, and everyone worked very hard. By the time of the wheat harvest, everyone was busy cutting wheat during the day and stacking wheat and sharpening knives at night, and had no time to settle accounts. The livestock and labor accounts accumulated more and more, and the more there were, the more chaotic they became, and they could not be calculated. Deng Shicheng had five extra days of work that were unaccounted for, and he was full of complaints. Deng Shibin also said, "I might as well pick wheat!" Some said that raising livestock was a loss, and some said that having labor was a loss. After the wheat harvest, the mutual aid team collapsed again amidst quarrels.

    From three organizations and three failures, Deng Shijie found the root causes of the mutual aid team's poor organization: First, forced grouping, without voluntary association; second, confusing work accounts, without implementing equivalent exchange; third, everyone could not correctly raise opinions, without implementing democratic management.

    II. Learning Advanced Experience

    Deng Shijie thought: I am the deputy director of the township farmers' association, and I can't even run a mutual aid team well. How can I be worthy of the Communist Party and the People's Government? One night in October 1951, he discussed with Deputy Team Leader Li Qingcai, Youth League member Li Peilin, Deng Fugang, and others. He said, "Our team has collapsed three times in two years, what should we do?" They heard that the work recording method of the Ji Baoguo Mutual Aid Team in Jilunzhai Township was good. Deng Shijie volunteered and traveled eighty li to Jilunzhai Township to learn from them. He worked in the fields with the members of the Ji Baoguo Mutual Aid Team during the day and attended their meetings at night. The first night he watched them evaluate work and record points, with everyone taking out their work tickets. Those with fewer points gave points, and those with more points received points. He thought: Work tickets are much better than recording accounts. The second night, he attended their self-criticism meeting. At the meeting, everyone pointed out who's work was good and who's work was bad today, and they criticized each other. Deng Shijie thought: It's good, but it's a bit embarrassing, and I'm worried that I won't be able to do it when I go back. Then he thought: If others can make self-criticisms, why can't our team? He made up his mind to do it that way when he went back. The third night, he watched them "find points" to settle accounts, which was both simple and clear.

    Three days of on-site learning enlightened Deng Shijie. On the way back, he confidently planned how to do it when he returned. Before entering the door, he bumped into Li Qingcai, and he shouted, "Our team has a solution!" That night, he gathered all the original team members for a meeting. He first reviewed the shortcomings of his past leadership, vividly explained the new methods he had seen in the Ji Baoguo Mutual Aid Team, boosted everyone's morale, and called on them to reorganize the mutual aid team.

    In the first month of this year, seven people from the team went to the Huai River embankment. Deng Shijie led everyone in holding eight nights of meetings to discuss the combination of Huai River harnessing and production, and the methods for reorganizing the mutual aid team. The mutual aid team was finally organized again, with one of the original nine households withdrawing and four new households joining, for a total of twelve households. After the Deng Shijie Mutual Aid Team implemented the new work recording and democratic management methods, it encountered two more problems: First, in the past, the mutual aid team used cattle for free, or one person-day was equivalent to one cattle-day. Now that cattle-days had to be recorded more points than person-days, everyone felt uncomfortable. Poor peasants Deng Shicheng and Deng Shibin refused to pay cattle-days, saying that the new method "kills the poor." Li Qingtai calculated detailed accounts for everyone, explaining that the expenses of cattle were greater than those of people, and only then was this problem solved. Second, in order to "emphasize democracy," the team held too many meetings. Every meeting started with a discussion of the daily work plan, and even trivial matters were brought up for discussion. As a result, each meeting lasted until midnight, and everyone was so tired that they had no energy to work the next day. Later, everyone pretended to be sick when they heard about the meetings. After a review, everyone re-stipulated: work would be checked once every three days, a discussion meeting would be held once every seven days, work would be arranged once every ten days, and a summary account would be made after each season of work was completed. Trivial matters would be solved by everyone talking while eating dinner.

    This mutual aid team implemented the three major principles of "voluntary association, equivalent exchange, and democratic management," implemented a reasonable "standard work point" system, and combined it with sideline production. As a result, it gradually consolidated and developed.

    III. Deng Shijie Mutual Aid Team's "Standard Work Points"

    One of the important reasons why the Deng Shijie Mutual Aid Team was able to consolidate and develop was its implementation of the "standard work point" system. The "standard work point" system was formulated after democratic discussion by comparing light work, heavy work, clumsy work, skillful work, agricultural work, and sideline work with each other. Its main contents are: work based on land, points based on work, payment based on labor, equal pay for men and women, young and old. Its calculation methods are: three evaluations and three combinations, three determinations, three wage increases, three calculations for cadres' lost work time, etc.

    Three Evaluations and Three Combinations. First, evaluate people. Determine points according to labor strength. A full labor force gets ten points per day, and a half labor force gets six points per day. Second, evaluate livestock. A large ox gets twenty points, a small ox gets fifteen points, a large donkey gets eighteen points, and a small donkey gets fifteen points. Third, evaluate land, with land within one li of the village being near land, two li being medium land, and three li being far land, and distinguish between improved land and ordinary land. Then, determine the standard points based on the amount of ox-days and person-days required for a certain amount of land and a certain amount of agricultural work. The person-days and ox-days points for working are paid by households with land.

    Three Determinations. This is an inspection system. First, determine the time. Determine the time to complete each stage of agricultural work, such as four days for harvesting wheat and ten days for cutting sorghum, which must be completed. Second, determine the quality. For example: (1) plowing the land seven inches wide and six inches deep, with uniform plowshare, even turning of the soil, and no raw soil exposed; (2) harrowing the land, leaving no corners or edges, and no "bunches of soil," etc. Third, determine the work. Add or subtract points appropriately based on the quality and quantity of work done. More work is calculated more, less work is calculated less.

    Three Wage Increases. Usually, each work point is converted into half a jin of grain. During the "three busy seasons" (wheat harvesting, sorghum cutting, and bean harvesting), it is calculated at double the rate, with each point being converted into one jin of grain. Wheat is paid after the wheat harvest, sorghum is paid after the sorghum harvest, and beans are paid after the bean harvest.

    Three calculations for cadres' lost work time for attending meetings: First, if there is a government notice, it is calculated; second, it is calculated when returning to the village to convey the spirit of the meeting and arrange work; third, it is calculated when the team has work to do. In this way, if anything is missing, the work is not calculated. This spring, Team Leader Deng Shijie went to the district and county to attend a mutual aid and cooperation meeting for eight days, and his family had four days of work, so he recorded four work points.

    "Standard work points" are more scientific than fixed points and dead recording, and more scientific than living recording with fixed points. This "contract system" of more work for more pay can encourage enthusiasm for production, reduce the trouble of evaluating work in the fields every day, and solve many problems that existed in the past mutual aid teams. However, the members of the Deng Shijie Mutual Aid Team are not satisfied with their existing achievements, and everyone hopes to continue to improve and consolidate. They all talk about the benefits of land shares after the land is invested in the Ji Mingxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative when they go to the fields to work. Everyone proposed: "Strive to create conditions and strive to establish an agricultural production cooperative next spring." Eight cadres and Youth League members also assured each other that they would play an exemplary leading role in creating the conditions for the establishment of cooperatives.

    邓诗杰互助组终于巩固起来了
    中共安徽省委农村工作委员会互助合作科
    安徽省涡阳县邓楼乡常李村邓诗杰互助组，是全县的一个比较出色的互助组。这个互助组是在一九五○年三月生产度荒时组织起来的，曾经三次散伙，最后是巩固起来，并且发展了。现在全组有十二户，包括贫农十户、中农二户。全体组员经过三年的互助生产，生活改善了，爱国热情提高了。全组除了耕种自有的土地外，还租入公地十二亩，以公地收获的粮食，作为公积金。
    组长邓诗杰是个三十七岁的朴实农民，贫农成分，解放前帮人拉过车，逃过荒，要过饭，受了不少苦；解放后，工作积极，曾被选为村长，现在担任乡公安员。前年、去年和今年，他三次当选为区的和县的一等劳动模范和丰产模范。远近农民都很仰慕他和他所领导的互助组，常常三三五五，从三五十里地以外赶来，向他们学习。
    一、三次失败
    邓诗杰互助组的发展过程是很曲折的。一九五○年三月间，乡长韩洪彦下了通知，要在三天内使全村都组成互助组。农会主任刘正鼎和财粮员刘正邦拿着户口册子，把全村一百零六户编成了十一个组。邓诗杰被编在邓诗彬组里。当时人们你望我，我望你，都不知道组织互助组是怎么一回事。干活时，七八个人一齐下地，一齐休息，干部来了，大家合伙干，干部走了，就各管各的。这样伙了三个月，误了不少工。邓诗林怕吃亏，不声不响地把牲口卖掉了。麦收后，互助组就垮了台。
    过了两个月，高粱发红，转眼就可以砍了，人民政府号召恢复旧互助组，组织新互助组，迎接秋收。大家觉得前次强迫组织失败了，这次要自找“对象”。开了两个晚上的会，有的说“打生不如烫熟”，还是老一伙在一块吧！大家同意之后，原班人马重新组成了一个互助组。秋收期间，全组大小六条牲口忙不过来，有牛户优先用牛，无牛户打不了场。李庆才比人家迟五天才打完场，小麦又没有种上。八月里一个月不见雨，九月初又下了十九天雨，误了下种。天一转晴，大家争着犁田。邓诗彬、李广才硬拉着中农邓诗魁的牛犁田，邓诗魁气得到处讲：“互助组敲人。”几家有牛户都顾虑再“互助”下去会拖死牛。牛工问题得不到解决，互助组又散伙了。
    一九五一年三月，治淮工程开始，村里动员了大批人去上堤。大家都担心因治淮耽误生产。当时邓诗杰是乡农会副主任，他抓紧这个时机，又说服原来的组员恢复了互助组。大家选举邓诗杰担任组长，李庆才担任副组长，并且实行记工算账。大家规定：每个整劳动力和每条牲口劳动一天记十分工，半劳动力记六分工。开始，他们每天带着账簿、笔墨下地记账，大家干活也很有劲。到了麦收时候，大家白天忙着割麦，晚上堆麦、磨刀，没工夫结账。牲口、人工账越积越多，越多越乱，算不出来了。邓诗成多出了五天工，没有着落，满肚子牢骚。邓诗彬也说：“我还不如拾麦哩！”有的说养牲口吃亏，有的说有劳动力吃亏。麦收以后，互助组又在争吵中垮了台。
    从三次组织和三次失败中，邓诗杰找到了互助组组织不好的根本原因：第一，强迫编组，没有自愿结合；第二，工账糊涂，没有实行等价交换；第三，大家不能正确提意见，没有实行民主管理。
    二、学习先进经验
    邓诗杰想：我是乡农会副主任，连一个互助组都办不好，怎样对得起共产党和人民政府呢？一九五
    一年十月的一个晚上，他和副组长李庆才、青年团员李培林、邓富广等七人商量。他说：“俺组两年垮了三回，怎办？”他们听说纪伦寨乡纪保国互助组的记工办法好，邓诗杰自告奋勇，跑了八十里路，赶到纪伦寨乡去学样子。他白天和纪保国互助组的组员一起下地干活，晚上参加他们的会议。第一晚看他们评工记分，大家拿出工票，少的出分，多的进分。他想：工票比记账强得多。第二晚，他参加了他们的检讨会，会上大家都提出今天谁的活好，谁的活坏，相互展开批评。邓诗杰想：好倒是好，就是有些难为情，担心自己回去搞不起来。又想：人家能检讨，俺组怎不能呢？他下定决心，回去一定照办。第三晚，看他们“找分”结账，既简便又清楚。
    三天的实地学习，邓诗杰的脑筋亮了。他在归途中，满怀信心地盘算回去怎么做。未进门先撞上了李庆才，他就叫道：“俺组有办法啦！”晚上，他召集原来互助组的全体组员开会。他首先检讨了过去领导的缺点，又生动地讲了他在纪保国互助组看到的新办法，鼓舞大家的情绪，号召重新组织互助组。
    今年正月，组里有七个人上淮堤，邓诗杰领导大家开了八个晚上的会，讨论治淮和生产结合和重新组织互助组的办法。互助组终于又组织起来了，原九户退出一户，新进来四户，共十二户。邓诗杰互助组实行新的记工和民主管理的办法以后，又碰到两个问题：一、过去互助组里是白用牛，或是一个人工顶一个牛工，现在牛工要比人工多记工，大家觉得不习惯。贫农邓诗成、邓诗彬不肯付牛工，说新办法“杀穷汉”。李庆泰给大家算细账，说明牛的开销比人要大，才解决了这个问题。二、为了“讲民主”，组里开会太多。一开会就从每天的工作计划谈起，连鸡毛蒜皮的事，也都搬到会上来谈。这样，一开就是半夜，大家累得第二天干活都没劲了。后来大家听说开会就装病。经过检讨，大家重新规定：三天检查一次工作，七天开一次讨论会，十天布置一次工作，每一季活干完总结账，平时琐碎事情利用晚饭时间，大家边吃边谈来解决问题。
    这个互助组贯彻了“自愿结合、等价交换、民主管理”的三大原则，实行了合理的“标准工分”，结合了副业生产，于是它就逐渐巩固起来并发展了。
    三、邓诗杰互助组的“标准
    工分”
    邓诗杰互助组得以巩固发展的重要原因之一，是它实行了“标准工分”制度。“标准工分”是把轻活、重活、笨活、巧活、农业活、副业活相互比较，经过民主讨论后制订出来的。它的主要内容是：按地出工，按活计分，按劳得资，男女老少同工同酬。它的计算方法是：三评三合、三定、工资三涨、干部误工三算等等。
    三评三合。一、评人。按劳动强弱，评定分数。整劳动力每天十分，半劳动力每天六分。二、评牲口。大牛二十分，小牛十五分，大驴十八分，小驴十五分。三、评地，以离庄一里以内为近地，二里为中地，三里为远地，并分出改良地和普通地。再以一定土地，一定农活，需要多少牛工、人工，订出标准分。作活的人工、牛工得分，有地户出分。
    三定。这是一种检查制度。一、定时。定出每个阶段农活完成时间，如收麦定时四天，砍秫秫定时十天，必须完成。二、定质。如：（1）犁地七寸宽，六寸深，犁头匀，翻土齐，不冒生地；（2）耙地，不留地角地边，不留“馒头疙瘩”，等等。三、定工。以做活好坏，做活多少，酌情加减。多作多算，少作少算。
    工资三涨。平时每个工资分，折粮食半斤，在
    “三忙”（割麦、砍秫秫、收豆子）时加倍计算，每分折粮食一斤。麦收后付麦，秫秫收后付秫秫，豆收后付豆子。
    互助组干部开会误工三算：一、有政府通知者算；二、回村传达会议精神布置工作时算；三、组里有活时算。这样，缺一样就不算工。今春组长邓诗杰到区、县参加互助合作会议，去了八天，家里有四天活，就记四个工。
    “标准工分”比死分死记、死分活记都要科学，这种多劳多得的“包干制”制度，能鼓励生产积极性，又可减少每天地头评工的麻烦，还解决了过去互助组里存在的许多问题。但是邓诗杰互助组的组员并没有满足于现有的成绩，大家都希望继续提高和巩固。他们下地干活时都谈着纪明选农业生产合作社土地入股后的好处。大家提出：“努力创造条件，争取明年春天成立农业生产合作社”。干部和青年团员八人也相互保证：要在创造建立合作社条件中，起模范带头作用。
