    On the Bolshevik Method of Leading Economic Organs
    Soviet Union, Silepov
    The Soviet people have successfully completed the tasks of the post-war Five-Year Plan, and under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Communist Party is organizing a new and powerful upsurge of domestic productive forces. Afforestation in arid areas, the construction of powerful hydroelectric stations on the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, the construction of canals and irrigation systems in Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Crimea, Rostov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast—all of this proves the further powerful upsurge of the Soviet national economy. The new great upsurge of Soviet economic construction, both in its nature and scale, is unparalleled in the entire past history of mankind, and it marks the successful construction of the material and technical foundation of communism in our country.

    The major tasks of economic construction require the Party's state committees, municipal committees, and district committees, as well as all Party organizations, to make every effort to improve the level of economic leadership and further strengthen the Party's organizational and political work. What we demand is that all Party organizations master the Bolshevik method of leading the economy, thoroughly abandon the bad habit of some Party organizations engaging in the practical work of managing the economy, because this habit inevitably weakens Party work, causes phenomena that are incompatible with Bolshevism that replace state organs and economic organs, and harms the cause.

    Lenin and Stalin, in their works, made a comprehensive study of the essence, nature, and methods of the Bolshevik Party's leadership of Soviet organs and economic organs, and the entire cause of socialist construction.

    As early as the initial period of the Soviet regime, Lenin and Stalin put forward the basic principles for the Party's leadership of economic construction. The most important of these is to clearly divide the functions between the Party, the Soviets, and the economic organs. The basis of this requirement is that the Party and state organs cannot be confused. The Party leads the economic life of the country, but it does not directly manage the economy. Comrade Stalin instructed: "The Party is the core of political power, but it is not and cannot be the same thing as state power."

    According to the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, the Party has repeatedly emphasized in its many resolutions that it is not permissible to confuse the functions of Party organizations with the functions of Soviet and economic organs.

    With the accumulation of experience in leading the economy, and estimating the characteristics of the environment and the new things provided by the experience of Party organizations in economic construction, the Party's general principled instructions have been further developed and specified. For example, during the period of national socialist industrialization, when new industrial sectors and hundreds of enterprises equipped with the latest technology had been established, Party organizations were required to have rich professional knowledge to lead the economy, and to study the various complex issues of technology, economy, and production organization. The Party put forward and practically solved the task of cultivating cadres who were proficient in the knowledge of various economic sectors and good at improving organization and practically leading economic work. In the process of socialist industrialization, the Party comprehensively studied the issue of production management and the establishment of one-man management system; Party organizations carried out a resolute struggle to rectify the management of industrial enterprises.

    With the victory of the collective farm system, the Party organization’s concern and responsibility for the situation and development of agriculture increased. Comrade Stalin's many speeches and the Party's resolutions on collective farm construction have made a comprehensive study of the leadership of the collective farm economy.

    Comrade Stalin's instructions on the Bolshevik method of leading economic organs at the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in March 1937 are of special significance for formulating correct methods of leading the economy. According to these instructions, Party organizations have combined economy and politics in their work and strengthened the Party's political work.

    Some important requirements of the Party in leading economic organs were clearly put forward in the resolutions of the 18th All-Union Congress of the CPSU. The meeting pointed out that the Party's municipal committees, state committees, regional committees, and even the central committees of the union republics, could directly and most objectively study the situation of enterprises without considering the narrow interests of their own units, find out the shortcomings in their work, and help economic organs to eliminate these shortcomings.

    The Party's resolutions sharply emphasized several aspects of practical leadership of economic work, such as the personal responsibility of economic leaders, the elimination of unaccountability in work, the correct allocation of personnel and the inspection of implementation, the strengthening of the Party's supervision of the work of economic organs, the combination of economic work with political work, the active development of socialist competition, and the convening of meetings of activists in production and economic work to absorb the experience of lower-level workers, etc.

    Therefore, the Party resolutely and thoroughly followed the principle that the direct management of the economy should be in the hands of state organs, while the Party, as the leading and guiding force of the proletarian dictatorship, should realize its leadership of the economy through the economic organs; therefore, it is not permissible to confuse the functions of Party organs and economic organs, it is not permissible to squeeze out economic organs' leadership of the economy, and especially it is not permissible for Party organs to take over and replace them. The more the economic organization function of the Soviet state expands, the more resolutely the Party implements this line, regarding it as the most important condition for strengthening our country's power.

    ×××

    During the Great Patriotic War, Party organs often had to engage in the practical work of managing the economy in the wartime environment. Under those conditions, this was correct. However, this also caused some undesirable phenomena in the work of Party organizations, weakened Party work, and at the same time replaced state organs and economic organs. Precisely for this reason, after the war, the Party put forward the task of raising the level of Bolshevik leadership of state and economic activities as one of the important tasks in the Party's work.

    While explaining the principles of Bolshevik leadership of the economy, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the significance of the item on Party organizations freeing themselves from economic trifles and strengthening Party and government work included in the draft resolution of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in February-March 1937 was not to abandon economic work and economic leadership, but to prevent Party organizations from replacing economic organs and making them unaccountable. Comrade Stalin said: "Therefore, it is necessary to master the Bolshevik method of leading economic organs. This method is to systematically help these organs, constantly consolidate them, and lead the economy not by leaving these organs but through them."

    ("Lenin and Stalin on Party Construction," Vol. II, p. 676, Russian edition, 1941)

    That is to say, if an economic organ is not doing its job well and cannot guarantee the completion of its tasks, then in this case, do not replace them and make them unaccountable; instead, consolidate them, help them, so that they can fully realize the responsibilities they shoulder.

    The Party committee is a political leading organ, and its mission is to organize and guide the activities of all state and social organizations. The Party committee is responsible for the economy, and it is by no means symbolic. The Party should judge the work of a Party organization based on the actual results in the economic field and the cultural and living facilities of the workers. However, although Party organizations do not replace economic organs and are not responsible for directly solving economic problems, it is still possible to give due influence to the progress of economic construction and the activities of economic organs.

    Comrade Stalin taught that the Party's leading role is manifested in the fact that the solution of any important political and organizational problem in our country cannot be separated from the Party's instructions. The Bolshevik Party determines the policies of the socialist state. Therefore, when formulating plans for industry or agriculture, trade or cultural construction, the Party and local Party organs should issue instructions, stipulate the nature and content of the plans, as well as the working direction of relevant organs, and ensure the unity and purposefulness of the actions of countless state organs and economic organs.

    The Party's leadership of economic organs is not limited to some instructions. What is important is that the Party's resolutions can be truly realized. "...The formulation of resolutions is only the first step, the beginning of the Party's leadership...The foundation of leadership does not lie in the formulation of resolutions, but in the execution of resolutions, the realization of resolutions." ("Complete Works of Stalin," Vol. 6, p. 270, Russian edition)

    The correct selection of cadres plays a decisive role in the leadership of economic organs. Lenin instructed: "Policies are implemented through people..." Comrade Stalin said that after the correct political line has been determined, it is necessary to select staff so that those in office are good at implementing the Party's instructions. If those in office cannot implement the instructions, then even the best instructions will fall through.

    The Party attaches great importance to the cultivation, education, and allocation of economic cadres. The primary task of Party organizations is to select outstanding organizers who can understand the significance of the Party's instructions and can resolutely struggle for their realization, as well as workers who regard the implementation of the Party's instructions as a glorious cause and their own sacred duty. When realizing the leadership of economic organs, the Party and its local organizations not only allocate cadres to various economic departments, but also supervise the work of cadres, help them realize the resolutions of the Party and the government, and ensure that economic cadres receive the support of the masses.

    Therefore, the necessary prerequisite for Bolshevik-style leadership of the economy is to carefully select cadres, ensure that Soviet organs and economic organs have strong and capable cadres, constantly educate workers in all economic sectors to have a high sense of responsibility for their work, and cultivate and train cadres ideologically and theoretically. Without this work, effective and beneficial work in any department of state and economic construction is inconceivable. The leading cadres in our national economy have grown and strengthened, and they have experienced great tests in the war and after the war. Now it is particularly important for Party organizations to do everything possible to support and encourage the initiative and autonomy of economic workers in their work.

    Party organizations have strengthened their attention to the work of cadres, but there are still some facts that incorrectly treat the selection and education of economic cadres, and sometimes replace educational work with commandism. There are also cases where Party committees do not have the necessary strict requirements for the leaders of Soviet organizations and economic organizations, so that they cannot consolidate discipline toward the Party and the state. When leading economic organs, Party organizations should educate economic cadres with the Bolshevik spirit of intolerance toward shortcomings and with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

    One of the most important aspects of political leadership is that Party organizations should supervise the work of economic organs. After the end of the Great Patriotic War, when the country was facing the new task of reforming the Party's work, the Central Committee of the CPSU put forward the task of consolidating local Party organs so that they could exercise practical supervision over the work of local state organs and economic organs, criticize and eliminate the shortcomings in their work, and also perform their political and organizational roles among the masses.

    Experience has shown that Party organizations have increasingly freed themselves from managing the trivial affairs of economic organs and interfering in their administrative management work in leading economic organs. By freeing themselves from the trivial affairs of the economy, Party organizations can concentrate their efforts on solving the fundamental problems in economic construction, such as mobilizing internal potential, improving labor productivity and product quality, highly utilizing the powerful technology of the socialist economy, consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically, improving field yields and livestock production rates, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience, etc. Practice has proven that not replacing economic organs not only does not weaken the Party's leadership of the economy, but strengthens it, improves the supervision of the work of economic leaders, strengthens the ideological training of economic cadres, and extensively develops the Party's organizational and political work.

    However, some Party committees still attempt to undertake the work of practical management of the economy that they should not undertake, while neglecting major issues, forgetting the future, and abandoning the Party's political work. This situation still exists until recently, especially in many Party organizations in Stalingrad Oblast. For example, it is well known how high our requirements are for agricultural organs, especially when carrying out the work of merging small collective farms. Many district committees in Stalingrad Oblast, sometimes even including the state committee, do not strengthen agricultural organs, but instead replace these organs, attempting to solve many economic problems with the strength of Party organs. As a result, specific leadership of sowing, harvesting, and procurement of agricultural products is concentrated in the Party's state committee and various district committees. At the same time, Soviet organs and economic organs, which have many skilled staff, cannot find the correct working direction, do not feel true Party leadership, lose their initiative, and are therefore far from being utilized. All of this cannot but cause serious shortcomings in economic work, and also affects the Party's political work, and political work in many districts is left unattended.

    The duty of the Party committee is to strengthen the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations, and to do everything possible to assist the Party organizations in the production departments to correctly use the rights granted to them by the CPSU Party Constitution to supervise the administrative activities of enterprises. According to the tasks and needs of production and workers' cultural and living facilities, Party grassroots organizations can and should exercise unremitting supervision over some major and decisive working departments. Timely expose and prevent shortcomings, and develop criticism and self-criticism.

    The issue of the work of Party grassroots organizations in enterprises and collective farms, especially their issue of exercising the right of supervision, should become the focus of attention of the Party's district committees, municipal committees, and state committees. This matter is particularly important because there are still facts that isolate the issue of Party supervision of administrative work, and separate it from the Party's political work of grassroots organizations. It is quite clear that all the Party's internal work, political work, and organizational work of grassroots organizations are expressed in the practice of Party organizations exercising their right of supervision and in the way and method of exercising this right. It has long been known that if the political work among all personnel in an enterprise is not done well, or if there is indifference to improving the ideological and theoretical level of Party members, then economic supervision cannot be carried out well, because these issues are inseparable from each other. Only when Party members have been organized and united, when they can learn themselves and educate others, when they can lead the non-Party masses with their own examples, when they have initiative and creativity, and when they treat shortcomings with an irreconcilable attitude, can Party organizations successfully influence the work of enterprises or collective farms. Without these, it is impossible to carry out practical and effective Bolshevik supervision of administrative work.

    The incorrect method of some Party committees leading the economy can also be proven by the actual situation of the work of various departments in the Party committee. They do not concentrate their attention on the fundamental issues of the work of the enterprises in the department, do not strictly supervise the economic leaders of the enterprises on the implementation of the instructions of the Party and the government, do not select and educate cadres, but often spend their energy on finding scarce parts, "soliciting" orders, and solving small economic problems, thereby becoming suppliers and various intermediaries for many organs and departments. Therefore, such a department changes from a link assisting the Party committee, from an institution that solves economic problems from a principled Party position, into an appendage of economic organs, and its activities cannot improve the level of Bolshevik leadership of the economy.

    Many state committees are taking measures to correct this shortcoming. The departments of the Altai Krai used to mainly engage in economic issues and did not go deep into the activities of Party organizations. Now, they pay more attention to Party organizations and the Party's political work.

    Correctly arranging the work of each department will help the Party committee to combine the Party's political work and economic work well.

    ×××

    Party organizations influence economic work by supervising the work of economic organs, checking the implementation of Party and government instructions by workers, selecting economic cadres, and summarizing the experience of socialist economic management, etc. But in the middle of this, the main lever for Party organizations to influence economic work is still the Party's political work and attracting the broad masses of workers to actively and consciously participate in economic construction.

    Comrade Stalin taught that the achievements of the economy, the consolidation and persistence of these achievements, all depend on the achievements of the Party's organizational work and political work. Without this condition, the achievements of the economy will not be consolidated. All of this stems from the socialist system, the inseparability of economy and politics, and the close coordination and interaction between economy and politics. Under Soviet conditions, without relying on activists, especially their advanced stratum—Party members, and without highly mobilizing the creative initiative of the masses, it is impossible to manage the economy.

    At the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in February-March 1937, Comrade Stalin criticized two types of workers, one who believed that in order to achieve economic achievements, they could despise the Party's political work, and the other who, on the contrary, believed that they could abandon the economy and only engage in the Party's political work. He said:

    "Politics and economics cannot be separated. We cannot be separated from economics, just as we cannot be separated from politics. For the convenience of research, people usually separate economic issues and political issues methodologically, but this is only methodological and artificial, only for the convenience of research. On the contrary, in life, in practice, politics and economics are inseparable. They exist together and work together. Whoever wants to separate economics and politics in our practical work, to strengthen economic work at the expense of weakening political work, or vice versa, to strengthen political work at the expense of weakening economic work, will inevitably fall into a dead end."

    All the experience of leading the economy confirms an indisputable truth: the achievements of the economy mostly rely on the Party organization's ability to create a highly tense labor atmosphere among the working masses, mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties; to give economic workers the most correct road based on the experience of workers and engineering and technical personnel, to mobilize internal resources and untapped potential to complete the plan, and to show Bolshevik energy and a determined spirit to achieve the established goals.

    Party and economic leaders have confirmed from many examples how close the mutual connection between politics and economics is. They have become deeply convinced that it is impossible to achieve significant and solid achievements in the economy without carrying out the Party's political work. As long as you carefully observe the work of experienced and capable economic organizers, you can see that they always connect leading the economy with the educational work of all personnel and organizing people and teaching them in the process of work. Bolshevik economic workers are very concerned about strengthening political work among the masses, because they correctly recognize that this is an important condition for achieving, consolidating, and developing production achievements. The higher the enthusiasm of the workers, the more effective the management of the enterprise. Each member of the collective should highly develop a sense of responsibility for completing the plan. Bolshevik economic workers are not afraid of the increase in the enthusiasm of the masses, on the contrary, they believe that enthusiasm is the most important condition for success. Only those who are bureaucratic and narrow-minded, or arrogant bureaucrats, will underestimate the political education of the people.

    Comrade Stalin emphasized the decisive role of subjective factors in our forward movement. In the current conditions of the gradual transition from socialism to communism, political work among the masses has particularly important significance. The more deeply the workers understand their tasks and the difficulties that must be overcome, the greater the achievements in economic construction. The task is to improve the political awareness of workers through political work and organizational work, cultivate Soviet patriotism, and fight against the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness.

    Many Party organizations have achieved success by combining the Party's political work with economic work. The experience of the Belarusian Party organization is noteworthy; it has widely adopted this method of political work among the masses, that is, Party and Soviet leaders make political reports at workers' meetings. In just two months, more than 7,500 people made reports in collective farms and enterprises throughout the republic.

    At the same time, facts indicate that there are still major shortcomings in political work. For example, not long ago, serious shortcomings were revealed in the Party's political work in many enterprises in Ivanovo Oblast and in the state committee's leadership of Party work. The Ivanovo Oblast Committee did not pay enough attention to the Party's political work in enterprises, and did not teach the secretaries of grassroots organizations in enterprises to engage in Party work. Many Party organizations in enterprises have not done enough in mobilizing male and female workers to complete and over fulfill plans, improve labor productivity, and improve product quality. The state committee did not require the leaders of economic organizations and trade union organizations to improve cultural and living facilities for residents, and forgot that paying attention to the needs of the masses and caring about meeting the growing material and cultural requirements of workers is the primary responsibility of the Party, Soviet, and trade union organizations.

    The mission of Party organizations is to more widely carry out political work among the masses, teach workers to care about the interests of socialist production, care about improving labor productivity, and constantly engage in socialist labor competition, because this competition is a communist method of socialist construction carried out on the basis of the enthusiasm of millions of working masses.

    Some Party committees allow themselves to use bureaucratic methods in their work: these committees pass a large number of resolutions, but are indifferent to the organization and inspection of implementation, only absorbing a small circle of people to work actively, and do not mobilize the Party's masses and workers to implement these resolutions. For example, a rural district committee sometimes limits itself to sending representatives to collective farms, but does not provide them with true leadership. This makes the district committee disengaged from the Party's grassroots organizations, disengaged from activists, disengaged from the collective farmers, narrows the working foundation, and loses the possibility of broadly and comprehensively influencing the work situation of the collective farms. If only a small circle of people are absorbed to work actively, then no matter how talented and knowledgeable they are, they cannot replace the initiative and experience of all personnel in the entire enterprise or collective farm. This is not the Party's leadership principle, but the bureaucratic leadership principle.

    There are also cases where Party leaders, when visiting an enterprise, only meet with the factory director and chief engineer, and do not take the time to talk to the secretary of the Party organization to understand what role the Party organization has played in the struggle to complete the economic plan, what shortcomings there are in the work, and how to overcome them. The same is true when district committee workers go to collective farms, they do not always think it is necessary to talk to the secretary of the Party organization, Party members, and ordinary collective farmers. This greatly narrows the scope of people that Party leaders contact and should rely on in their leadership work. At the conference of Party grassroots organization secretaries of collective farms throughout Ukraine held at the end of December 1950, some typical facts in this regard were exposed. The Party organization secretary of the "Lenin's Road" Collective Farm (Sakhnovshchinsky District, Kharkov Oblast) said: "When the district committee secretary comes to us, he first looks for the collective farm chairman. Even when he meets the Party organization secretary, he asks: 'Where is the chairman?' He only talks to the collective farm chairman." Needless to say, this district committee secretary who does not talk to the Party organization secretary of the collective farm is not a Party leader, but a very bad administrator.

    It is the most correct and effective method for the Party committee to rely on the Party's grassroots organizations in leading the economy, and it is the most reliable method of understanding the work situation, exposing major shortcomings, and determining the necessary means to improve the work. If the state committee or district committee closely contacts the Party's grassroots organizations, it can timely understand the bad situation of the work, and Party members will suggest to it new possibilities of utilizing potential.

    One of the duties of the Party committee is to help grassroots organizations use their right to supervise administrative work, give play to everyone's initiative and creativity, and mobilize Party members and workers to actively complete the Party's tasks.

    In the post-war period, Party organizations were required to seriously transform the Party's political work, and many Party committees have made significant achievements in this regard. However, there are still cases of simply understanding this requirement. Some Party leaders argue like this: Since we are now discussing more Party work issues and fewer economic issues at the meeting, isn't it that we have already realized the transformation of Party work? This is certainly not correct. Although the number of Party political work issues discussed is much larger than economic issues, it is still possible to violate the Bolshevik leadership principles after all. The amount does not explain anything.

    The correct coordination of political work and economic work does not mean that a quantitative ratio should be stipulated between the economic work and the Party's political work issues discussed at the Party committee meeting. What is important is that every economic issue should be resolved in the spirit of the Party (not narrowly local). For example, let's take the discussion of product quality issues. This can be discussed within a narrow economic scope, and many instructions that are not much different from economic orders can be issued to enterprise leaders or technicians. This issue can also be raised with sharp political eyes, mobilizing the broad masses to fight for product quality, striving to discover untapped potential, that is, handling this issue with the attitude that a political leading organ should have.

    Some Party workers mistakenly believe that in order to do everything possible to improve the Party's organizational work and political work, Party organizations can reduce their attention to the economy to a certain extent, not solve economic problems, and only engage in Party work. This is obviously a wrong idea. The task of Party workers is to point out to economic workers the methods to overcome difficulties, mobilize supplementary reserves to complete the state plan. For this, it is necessary to have profound economic knowledge, not only to be good at the current movement, but also to foresee future tasks.

    The further improvement of Party work in enterprises, state farms, machine tractor stations, and collective farms will inevitably strengthen the Party organizations' influence on the economy and improve the Party's leading role in the entire economic and cultural life of enterprises, collective farms, and districts. Party work is not an end in itself, but a means to achieve the Party's current tasks; Party work should be entirely for the purpose of achieving success in socialist construction. If Party work does not achieve economic results, it is equal to doing it in vain.

    At the same time, only by actively participating in economic life and vigorously improving Party members' concern and attention to the production activities of enterprises or collective farms can Party work be widely developed and Party life be active. Party meetings, Party entrustment, theoretical study, the entire daily activities of Party members, and all of the Party's work can only be active, enthusiastic, and meaningful when they are for the purpose of realizing the Party organization's economic tasks.

    In the post-war period, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the people, the Communist Party has achieved the most tremendous achievements in communist construction. The over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan in the most important departments can prove this. The significant achievements achieved by the Soviet people show that the Party and its local organizations can truly deeply mobilize the people in urban and rural areas and develop a socialist competition of the whole people.

    Party committees are increasingly deeply mastering the Bolshevik method of leading the economy, and are constantly consolidating Soviet organs and economic organs. Further improving the Party's method of leading the economy and vigorously strengthening the Party's political work are the guarantee for achieving new achievements in communist construction.

    论领导经济机关的布尔什维克方法
    苏联  斯列波夫
    苏联人民成功地完成了战后五年计划的任务，共产党在伟大的斯大林的领导下，正在组织着国内生产力的新而有力的高涨。干旱地区的植林工作，在伏尔加河和第聂伯河强大水电站的建筑，在土库曼、乌克兰、克里米亚，在罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州的运河和灌溉系统的建筑——这一切都证明着苏联国民经济进一步的有力高涨。苏联经济建设的新的巨大高涨，无论其性质和规模，都是人类过去全部历史上所无与伦比的，它标志着在我国正成功地建设着共产主义的物质—技术基础。
    经济建设的重大任务，要求党的州委会、市委会和区委会，要求各党组织尽力提高领导经济的水平，进一步加强党的组织工作和政治工作。我们所要求的，是一切党的组织都能掌握领导经济的布尔什维克方法，彻底抛弃一些党组织从事管理经济的实际工作的不良习惯，因为这种习惯不可避免地要削弱党内工作，造成与布尔什维主义不相容的代替国家机关和经济机关的现象而有害于事业。
    列宁和斯大林在其一些著作中，关于布尔什维克党领导苏维埃机关和经济机关、领导社会主义建设全部事业的实质、性质和方法问题，作了全面的研究。
    早在苏维埃政权初期，列宁和斯大林就提出了党领导经济建设的各项基本原则。其中最重要的一点，便是明确划分党、苏维埃和经济机关之间的职能。这一要求的根据是：不能把党和国家机关混淆起来，党领导国家的经济生活，但它并不直接管理经济。斯大林同志指示说：“党是政权的核心，但它与国家政权不是也不能是一件东西。”
    根据列宁和斯大林的指示，党在自己的许多决议中经常强调：不容许把党组织的职能与苏维埃机关和经济机关的职能混淆起来。
    随着领导经济的经验积累，估计到环境的特点和党组织在经济建设方面的经验所提供的新东西，党的一般原则性指示获得了进一步的发展和具体化。例如，在国家社会主义工业化时期，当新的工业部门，千百个以最新技术装备起来的企业已经建立起来，便要求党的组织要有丰富的业务知识来领导经济，要钻研技术、经济和生产组织的各种复杂问题。党提出并实际地解决了培养精通各种经济部门知识、善于改进组织和实际领导经济工作的干部的任务。在社会主义工业化过程中，党全面地研究了关于生产管理和建立一长制的问题；党的组织为整顿工业企业的管理进行了坚决的斗争。
    随着集体农庄制度的胜利，党组织对农业的状况和发展的关心和责任加重了。斯大林同志的许多言论和党关于集体农庄建设的决议，对集体农庄经济的领导问题作了全面的研究。
    斯大林同志在一九三七年三月联共中央全会上关于领导经济机关的布尔什维克方法的指示，对于制订正确领导经济的方法有特殊的意义。党组织根据这些指示，在自己工作中已把经济与政治结合起来，加强了党的政治工作。
    党在领导经济机关方面的一些重要要求，在联共第十八次全苏联代表会议的决议中明白地提了出来。会议指出：党的市委会、州委会、边疆区委会以至加盟共和国中央委员会都有可能直接地、最客观地、不考虑本单位狭隘利益地研究企业情况，找出工作中的缺点，并帮助经济机关消除这些缺点。
    在党的决议中尖锐地强调了实际领导经济工作的几个方面，如经济领导者的个人责任，取消工作中的无人负责现象，正确配备人员和检查执行情况，加强党对经济机关工作的监督，经济工作要与政治工作结合，尽力展开社会主义竞赛，召开生产经济工作的积极分子会议以吸收下级工作人员的经验等等。
    因此，党坚决而彻底地遵行了这一原则，即经济的直接管理权应当掌握在国家机关手里，而党这一无产阶级专政的领导和指导力量，则应通过经济机关来实现其对经济的领导；所以不容许把党机关和经济机关的职能混淆起来，不容许排挤经济机关对经济的领导，尤其不容许党的机关包办代替。苏维埃国家的经济组织职能愈扩大，党也就愈加坚决地实行这一路线，把它看作是加强我国威力的最重要条件。
    ×××
    伟大卫国战争时期，党机关在战时环境下，往往不得不从事管理经济的实际工作。在那种条件下，这是正确的。但这也造成了党组织工作中的一些不良现象，削弱了党内工作，同时代替了国家机关与经济机关。正因如此，所以党在战后提出了要把提高对国家和经济活动的布尔什维克领导水平的任务当做党工作中重要任务之一。
    斯大林同志在说明布尔什维克领导经济的原则时指出：一九三七年联共中央二月—三月全会决议草案中所包括的关于党组织摆脱经济琐事和加强党政工作一项的意义，并不是要党组织抛弃经济工作和经济领导，而是要党组织不要代替经济机关和使其无人负责。斯大林同志说：“因此，就必须掌握领导经济机关的布尔什维克方法。这一方法就是要有系统地帮助这些机关，经常地巩固它们，不是离开这些机关而是通过这些机关来领导经济。”
    （“列宁和斯大林论党的建设”，第二卷第六七六页，一九四一年俄文版）
    这就是说，如果某一个经济机关工作做得不好，不能保证任务的完成，那么，在这种情况下不要去代替它们和使其无人负责；而应当去巩固它们，帮助它们，使它们能完全地实现所担负的职责。
    党委会是政治领导机关，它的使命是组织和指导一切国家和社会组织的活动。党委会对经济负有责任，而且绝不是象征的。党应根据经济方面和劳动者的文化生活设施方面的实际效果来判断某一党组织的工作。但是党组织虽不代替经济机关，不负直接解决经济问题的责任，也是有可能对经济建设的进程、对经济机关的活动给予应有的影响的。
    斯大林同志教导说，党的领导作用表现在我国任何一个重要的政治和组织问题的解决，都不能离开党的指令。布尔什维克党决定社会主义国家的政策。因此，党、地方党机关在制订关于工业或农业、贸易或文化建设方面的计划时，应颁发指示，规定计划的性质和内容，以及有关机关的工作方向，保证无数国家机关和经济机关行动的统一和有目的性。
    党对经济机关的领导，不仅限于一些指示。重要的是党的决议能真正实现。“……决议的制订只是第一步，是党领导的开始……领导的基础不在于制订决议，而在于执行决议，实现决议。”（“斯大林全集”第六卷，第二七○页，俄文版）
    正确的挑选干部，对于经济机关的领导有决定作用。列宁曾指示说：“政策是通过人来实行的……”斯大林同志说，正确的政治路线决定以后，就必须挑选工作人员，使在职人员善于执行党的指令。如果在职人员不能执行指令，那么，即使多么好的指令，也会落了空。
    党很重视培养、教育和配备经济干部。党组织的首要任务，就是要选拔能够了解党的指令的意义并又能坚决为它的实现而奋斗的优秀的组织者，以及把实行党的指令当做光荣的事业和自己崇高职责的工作人员。党及其地方组织在实现对经济机关的领导时，不只是把干部分配给各个经济部门，而且要监督干部的工作，帮助他们实现党和政府的决议，保证经济干部得到群众的支持。
    因此，布尔什维克式领导经济的必要前提，就是要细心选拔干部，保证苏维埃机关及经济机关有坚强而有能力的干部，时时刻刻教育一切经济部门的工作人员对其工作有高度的责任心，并在思想上理论上培养和训练干部。如果没有这一工作，那么在国家和经济建设任何一个部门的有成效和有益的工作，都是不可思议的。我们国民经济中的领导干部已经成长和坚强起来，他们已在战时和战后经历了很大的考验。现在特别重要的，是要党组织竭力支持和鼓励经济工作人员在工作中的主动性和自主性。
    党组织加强了对干部工作的注意，然而还有一些不正确地对待经济干部的挑选和教育的事实，有时以命令主义代替了教育工作。也还有这种情形，党委会对苏维埃组织和经济组织的领导者没有必要的严格要求，以致不能巩固对党和国家的纪律。党组织在领导经济机关时，应以对缺点采取布尔什维克的不可容忍的精神、以批评和自我批评的精神，教育经济干部。
    政治领导的一个最重要方面，就是党组织要监督经济机关的工作。伟大卫国战争结束后，当国家正面临必须改革党的工作的新任务时，联共中央便提出了巩固地方党机关的任务，使它们能够对地方国家机关和经济机关的工作实行实际的监督，批评和消除它们工作中的缺点，同时也执行自己在群众中的政治与组织的作用。
    经验证明，党组织在领导经济机关的工作中，已日益摆脱了代管经济机关的琐碎事务和对它们的行政管理工作的干涉。党组织摆脱了经济的烦琐事务，就有可能集中力量来解决经济建设中的根本问题，如动员内在潜力，提高劳动生产率和产品质量，高度利用社会主义经济的强大技术，在组织上经济上巩固集体农庄，提高田地收获量和畜产率，总结和推广先进经验等等。实践证明，不代替经济机关，不但不会削弱、反会加强党对经济的领导，改善对经济领导者的工作的监督，加强经济干部的思想锻炼，广泛开展党的组织工作和政治工作。
    但是，某些党委会仍然企图担负不是它们所应担负的实际管理经济的工作，而忽略了重大问题，忘记了前途，放弃了党的政治工作。这种情况直到最近还存在，特别是在斯大林格勒州的许多党组织内。例如，众所周知，我们对农业机关有着如何高的要求，尤其是当进行合并小集体农庄的工作时。斯大林格勒州的许多区委会，不去加强农业机关，有时甚至连州委会在内都要代替这些机关，企图以党机关的力量来解决许许多多的经济问题。结果，具体领导播种、收获、农产品的采购等工作，都集中在党的州委会和各区委会中。与此同时，拥有很多熟练工作人员的苏维埃机关和经济机关，却找不到正确的工作方向，感不到真正的党的领导，丧失了主动性，因而被利用得远为不够。这一切不能不造成经济工作中的严重缺点，同时也影响到党的政治工作，许多区中的政治工作都是无人照管的。
    党委会的职责，是加强对党的基层组织的领导，竭力协助生产部门的党组织正确利用联共党章赋与它们的监督企业行政活动的权利。党的基层组织，根据生产和工人文化生活设施方面的任务和需要，能够而且应当对一些主要的和有决定意义的工作部门实行毫不减弱的监督。及时地揭发和防止缺点，展开批评与自我批评。
    企业和集体农庄中党基层组织的工作问题，特别是它们实行监督权利的问题，应成为党的区委会、市委会和州委会的注意中心。这件事之所以特别重要，是因为现在仍有这样的事实：把党监督行政工作的问题孤立起来看，把它和基层组织的党的政治工作分割开来看。十分显然，基层组织的全部党内工作、政治工作和组织工作，都在党组织实行其监督权利的实践中和实行这一权利的方式方法中表现出来。大家早已知道，在企业全体人员中的政治工作做得不好，或者对提高共产党员的思想理论水平漠不关心，便不能很好地实行对经济的监督，因为这些问题是彼此不可分割的。党组织要成功地影响企业或集体农场的工作，只有在共产党员已组织起来和团结起来，他们自己能够学习并去教育别人，能以自己的范例带动非党群众，有主动性和创造性，并以不可调和的态度对待缺点的时候，才有可能。没有这些，就不可能对行政工作进行实际有效的布尔什维克的监督。
    某些党委会领导经济的不正确方法，也可以由党委会中各部工作的实际情况来证明。它们不集中注意于该部企业工作的根本问题，不极严格地监督企业的经济领导者对党和政府指令的实行情况，不去选拔和教育干部，时常却把力量花费在寻找缺乏的零件、“招揽”订货、解决细小的经济问题，从而变成供给机关和许多机关和部门的各种斡旋者。因此，这样的部便由协助党委会的一个环节、由具有原则性的党的地位来解决经济问题的机构，变成了经济机关的附属物，同时其活动也不能提高布尔什维克领导经济的水平。
    许多州委会都在采取一些措施来纠正这个缺点。阿尔泰边疆区的各部，过去主要是从事经济问题并没有深入到各党组织的活动中去。现在，它们已更多地注意各党组织和党的政治工作问题了。
    正确安排各个部的工作，将协助党委会很好地把党的政治工作和经济工作结合在一起。
    ×××
    党的组织，是以监督经济机关的工作，检查工作人员对党和政府指令执行的情形，选拔经济干部，总结社会主义经济管理经验等等，来影响经济工作的。但是在这中间，党组织影响经济工作的主要杠杆，仍然是党的政治工作和吸引广大劳动群众来积极自觉地参加经济建设。
    斯大林同志教导说，经济的成就，这些成就的巩固和持久，全赖于党的组织工作和政治工作的成绩。没有这个条件，经济的成就是不会巩固的。这一切都根源于社会主义制度，经济与政治的不可分离，以及经济与政治的密切配合和相互作用。在苏维埃条件下，不依靠积极分子，特别是其先进阶层——共产党员，不高度发动群众的创造性主动性，就不能管理经济。
    斯大林同志在一九三七年联共中央二月—三月全会上批评了两种工作人员，一种认为为了在经济上获得成就，可以轻视党的政治工作，另一种相反地认为可以抛开经济，只搞党的政治工作，他说：
    “不能把政治和经济分开。我们不能脱离经济，就和我们不能脱离政治一样。为了研究方便，人们通常从方法论上把经济问题和政治问题分开，但这样作只是方法的、人为的，只为了便于研究而已。相反，在生活中，在实践中，政治与经济是不可分割的。它们一起存在，一块起作用。谁想在我们的实际工作中把经济和政治分开，以削弱政治工作为代价而加强经济工作，或者相反，以削弱经济工作为代价而加强政治工作，那他就一定会陷入绝境。”
    领导经济的全部经验，证实了一个不可辩驳的真理：经济的成就多半赖于党组织能在工人群众中造成高度紧张的劳动气氛，发动群众去克服困难；能根据工人和工程技术人员的经验，给经济工作人员提示最正确的道路，动员内部资源和未被利用的潜在能力以完成计划，能表现出布尔什维克的精力和力求达到既定目的的坚决精神。
    党和经济的领导者已从许多例子中确信，政治与经济之间，存在着何等密切的互相联系。他们已经深信，不进行党的政治工作，想在经济上获得重大而巩固的成就是不可能的。只要仔细观察一下有经验、有才能的经济组织家的工作，就可以看出：他们永远是把领导经济与对全体人员的教育工作和组织人们以及在工作过程中教导他们联系起来的。布尔什维克的经济工作人员，是十分关心加强群众中的政治工作的，因为他们正确地认识到这是达到、巩固和发展生产成就的重要条件。工人的积极性越高，领导企业就越有成效。每个集体的成员，都应当高度发挥完成计划的责任感。布尔什维克的经济工作人员不害怕群众积极性的提高，相反地，却认为积极性是成功的最重要条件。只有事务主义者和气量狭小的人，或是高傲的官僚主义分子，才会过低估计人们的政治教育。
    斯大林同志曾强调主观因素在我们前进运动中的决定作用。在目前由社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡的条件下，群众中的政治工作具有特别重要的意义。劳动者对他们的任务和必须克服的困难了解越深刻，那末经济建设中所获得的成就也就越大。任务在于要通过政治工作和组织工作来提高劳动者的政治觉悟，培养苏维埃爱国主义，与人们意识中的资本主义残余作斗争。
    许多党的组织由于把党的政治工作与经济工作相结合而获得了成就。白俄罗斯党组织的经验是值得注意的；它在群众中广泛地采用了这种政治工作方式，即党和苏维埃的领导人员在劳动者大会上作政治报告。仅两个月内，在共和国各集体农庄和企业就有七千五百多人作了报告。
    同时事实指出，在政治工作中还存有重大缺点。例如，不久以前，在伊凡诺佛州许多企业的党的政治工作和州委会对党的工作的领导中，都揭露出严重的缺点。伊凡诺佛州委会对于企业中的党的政治工作没有给予足够的注意，没有教导企业中基层组织的书记从事党的工作。企业中的许多党组织在动员男女工人完成和超额完成计划、提高劳动生产率和改善产品质量方面，做得不够。州委会没有要求经济组织和职工会组织的领导者改善对居民的文化生活设施，忘记了注意群众需要、关心满足劳动者增长着的物质和文化要求，是党、苏维埃和职工会组织的首要职责。
    党组织的使命是要更广泛地在群众中开展政治工作，教导劳动者关心社会主义生产的利益，关心提高劳动生产率，经常从事社会主义劳动竞赛，因为这种竞赛是在千百万劳动群众积极性的基础上进行社会主义建设的共产主义方法。
    某些党委会容许自己工作中的文牍主义、官僚主义的方法：这些委员会通过大量决议，而对组织检查执行方面却漠不关心，只吸收一小圈子人积极工作，而不动员党的群众和劳动者去执行这些决议。例如，一个乡村区委会有时只限于派遣代表到集体农庄去，而不对它们进行真正的领导。这就使区委会产生脱离党的基层组织，脱离积极分子，脱离集体农民群众，缩小工作基础，并丧失广泛而全面地影响集体农庄工作情况的可能。如果只吸收一小圈子人积极工作，那么任凭他们多么有才干、有知识，也是代替不了整个企业或集体农庄全体人员的主动性和经验的。这不是党的领导原则，而是官僚主义的领导原则。
    还有这种情形，党的领导者去访问一个企业时，只是会见厂长、总工程师，并不找时间去和党组织的书记谈话，了解党组织在完成经济计划斗争中起了什么作用，在工作中有什么缺点及如何克服它们的。区委会工作人员到集体农庄去的时候也是如此，他们并不是经常认为需要和党组织的书记、党员和普通集体农民们谈话。这便大大缩小了党的领导者所接触的和在自己领导工作中应当依靠的人的范围。在一九五○年十二月底举行的乌克兰全共和国集体农庄党基层组织书记会议上，暴露了这方面的一些典型事实。“列宁之路”集体农庄（哈尔科夫州，萨赫诺夫申斯基区）党组织书记说：“区委书记到我们这里来的时候，他首先找集体农庄主席。甚至遇到党组织书记时还问道：‘主席在哪儿？’他只是和集体农庄主席谈话。”不用说，这个不和集体农庄党组织书记谈话的区委书记，不是党的领导者，而是很坏的行政官。
    党委会在领导经济中要依靠党的基层组织，这是最正确和最有效的领导方法，是了解工作情况、揭露主要缺点、决定改善工作所必需的手段的最可靠的方法。如果州委会或区委会密切地联系党的基层组织，它能够及时地了解工作的不良情况，共产党员会提示给它利用潜力的新的可能性。
    党委会的职责之一，就是要帮助基层组织使用它的监督行政工作的权利，发挥大家的主动性和创造性，动员共产党员和劳动者去积极完成党的任务。
    战后时期，要求党组织认真地转变党的政治工作，而许多党委会在这方面是取得了重大成绩的。但是仍有简单化地认识这个要求的情形。有些党的领导者这样议论：既然现在我们在会议上所讨论的党的工作问题多了，而经济问题少了，不就是我们已经实现了党工作的转变吗。这当然是不正确的。尽管所讨论的党的政治工作问题比经济问题多得多，但毕竟还是可能违背布尔什维克的领导原则的。多少并不能说明什么问题。
    政治工作与经济工作的正确配合，并不是说要在党委会的会议上所讨论的经济工作与党的政治工作的问题之间规定一个数量上的比例。重要的是，每一经济问题都要根据党的精神（不是狭隘本位地）予以解决。例如，就拿讨论产品质量问题来说，这可以在狭小的经济范围内进行讨论，可以向企业领导者或技师发出许多与经济命令无甚区别的指示。也可以用尖锐的政治眼光提出这个问题，发动广大群众为产品质量而斗争，力求发掘未被利用的潜力，也就是说，以政治领导机关应有的态度来处理这一问题。
    某些党的工作人员错误地认为：要竭力改善党的组织工作和政治工作，党组织就可以在某种程度上减少对经济的注意，不去解决经济问题，而只搞党的工作。这显然是错误的想法。党工作人员的任务，是要给经济工作人员指出克服困难、动员补充后备力量以完成国家计划的办法。为此就要有深刻的经济知识，不仅善于搞目前的运动，而且还能预见将来的任务。
    在企业、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、集体农场中党的工作的进一步提高，必然加强党组织对于经济的影响，提高党对企业、集体农庄和区的全部经济文化生活的领导作用。党的工作不是目的本身，而是实现党的当前任务的手段；党的工作应该完全是为了取得社会主义建设的成就。如果党的工作未获得经济上的成绩，那就等于白做。
    同时，只有积极参加经济生活，大力提高共产党员对企业或集体农庄生产活动的关心和注意，党的工作才能广泛展开，党内生活才能活跃起来。党的会议、党的委托、理论学习、党员全部日常活动，党的全部工作，只有在为了实现党组织的经济任务时，才能活跃、热烈和有内容。
    战后时期，共产党在人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志的领导下，在共产主义建设方面达到了最巨大的成就。五年计划在最重要部门的超额完成，就可以证明这一点。苏联人民所达到的重大成就，说明党及其地方组织能够真正深入发动城乡人民群众，开展全民的社会主义竞赛。
    党委会在日益深入地掌握领导经济的布尔什维克方法，时时巩固着苏维埃机关和经济机关。而进一步改善党领导经济的方法，竭力加强党的政治工作，则是共产主义建设获得新成就的保证。
