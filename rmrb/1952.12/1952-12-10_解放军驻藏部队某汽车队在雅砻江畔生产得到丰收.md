    PLA Troops Stationed in Tibet Achieve Bumper Harvest in Production on the Banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River

    Editor: I'm reporting some good news. As early as the beginning to mid-April, when the snow on the Kangzang Plateau had just begun to melt, a motor vehicle unit stationed on the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River in the Tibetan Plateau began agricultural production. From that time on, a large area of virgin land on the east bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River was overturned by the people's fighters with shovels and pickaxes. Three hundred acres of grassland have been transformed into farmland with "interconnected fields and crisscrossing ditches."

    In October, the comrades braved rain and snow to harvest crops. Wang Chongxin, political instructor of the Third Company, holding a 30-jin radish, said to me: "I must send this big radish to Chairman Mao! Let the people of the whole country know that this 30-jin radish grows on the remote Kangzang Plateau." Yang Zhongda, deputy company commander of the Second Company, holding a 4.7-jin potato, said to me: "Our company alone can harvest more than 40,000 jin of potatoes, which we can't eat up in a year." The unit harvested various vegetables, including cabbages weighing 12 jin each, scallions weighing 1.2 jin each, as well as spinach, amaranth, cabbage, and chives, all kinds of vegetables.

    The yield per unit area of various vegetables in the unit has greatly exceeded the best harvest amount in the local area in the past. People say that life on the Kangzang Plateau is hard, and the lack of vegetables is one of the main reasons. Now, the troops stationed in Tibet have improved their lives through their own labor. This year's bumper harvest has further increased their confidence in building the Kangzang Plateau.　Zhou Langsheng

    解放军驻藏部队某汽车队在雅砻江畔生产得到丰收
    编辑同志：报告你一个好消息。远在四月初旬到中旬，康藏高原上的积雪刚刚开始融化的时候，住在西藏高原雅砻江畔的某部汽车部队，就开始了农业生产。从那时起，雅砻江东岸一大片处女地，就被人民战士们用洋锹、十字镐掀翻了身。三百亩的草原，已变成“阡陌相连，沟渠纵横”的庄稼地了。
    十月间，同志们冒着雨雪收割庄稼。三连政治指导员王崇信抱着一个三十斤重的大萝卜对我说：“我一定要把这个大萝卜送给毛主席！让全国人民都知到，这个三十斤重的大萝卜，就是生长在边远的康藏高原上的。”二连的副连长杨仲达手里拿了个四斤七两重的洋芋对我说：“我们连光洋芋就可收四万多斤，一年也吃不完。”部队收获的各种蔬菜，有十二斤重一个的莲花白，一斤二两重一根的葱，菠菜、苋菜、白菜、韭菜，样样都有。
    该部各种蔬菜的单位面积产量，大大地超过了当地过去最好的收获量。人们都说康藏高原生活苦，缺乏蔬菜是主要原因之一。现在驻藏部队已用自己的劳动改善了自己的生活。今年的丰收，更增加了他们建设康藏高原的信心。　周浪声
