    Yang Yubao, Director of the Ying Shang Nan Zhao Town Farmers' Association, Should Not Abuse His Power to Bully the Masses

    Editor: I am a small vendor who makes a living by setting up a stall in Nan Zhao Town, Ying Shang County, Anhui Province. On May 1st of this year, Yang Yubao, the director of the Nan Zhao Town Farmers' Association, retaliated against me out of spite. During the execution of counter-revolutionaries, he had my wife, Chen, dragged out to "accompany the execution" and announced a two-year period of supervision, which frightened her into illness. I am making a special appeal to the newspaper and requesting that the higher-level government send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation to understand the situation, protect her life, and correct this egregious act of bullying the masses.

    The events are as follows: In February of this year, Director Yang Yubao borrowed my bicycle and dropped it in the water, ruining the canvas inside the tire and damaging the bike beyond repair. My wife inadvertently mentioned this to someone. Director Yang became very angry. The second time he came to borrow the bike, my wife refused. He held a grudge because of this. In April, when hiring laborers to repair dikes for flood control, the merchants and residents on the street were asked to contribute voluntarily. At the meeting, my wife volunteered to contribute two and a half points. Director Yang forced her to contribute three points. She refused and said that Director Yang was unfair. Director Yang got angry and detained her. She also became angry and spoke about the land reform cadres dividing the fruits of labor unequally. She said, "You are leading the poor to turn over, but why do your relatives and cadres get good houses, while the poor and hired peasants don't, or only get bad ones? Isn't this unfair?" Director Yang became even more angry and decided to "punish" her. Six days later, on Labor Day, the town held a celebration and a public trial of counter-revolutionaries. The masses all went to the meeting, and she went too. After the public trial began, the masses were called upon to expose counter-revolutionaries. Director Yang arranged for people to accuse my wife, fabricating five major charges: 1. She is a prostitute and loafer; 2. She engages in unscrupulous buying and selling in business; 3. She scolds her neighbors; 4. She undermines land reform; 5. She doesn't contribute labor points and sabotages flood control. The District Committee Secretary Fu Yuebo then called her onto the stage, put handcuffs on her, ordered her to kneel facing north together with the counter-revolutionaries, and forbade her from speaking. The People's Court then announced a two-year period of supervision. When the meeting ended, militiamen dragged her, forcing her to run back to town. At the time, she was five months pregnant and couldn't walk fast. Under Director Yang's instructions, one militiaman held her handcuffs, another pressed her mouth with a shoe, kicking her wildly with their feet, and another beat her with a gun. She was beaten and frightened, losing her shoes and socks, and becoming dazed and speechless. That evening, District Committee Secretary Fu Yuebo sent someone to find me and said, "Your wife is too bad, scolding cadres. We are doing this to educate her. Now you can take her back, but you must educate her well and not let her die. If she dies, you will be responsible." When I took her back that night, she was unable to walk. The next day, her whole body was bruised and swollen, and she was in unbearable pain, weeping bitterly. I asked a doctor to treat her, and the doctor said she was likely to miscarry. I asked neighbors and several doctors to take care of her. After taking medicine, she did not miscarry. Because she cannot run her business, over one million yuan of capital has been used up, and we are still in debt. Our family of four (two children) can only weep in secret every day. She has headaches and back pain every day, and she wants to die. I cannot leave her day or night. I want to appeal to higher levels, but I am afraid of retaliation. Helplessly, I wrote to the newspaper, asking you to convey this to the relevant higher-level government, and quickly send personnel to conduct an actual investigation to redress this injustice.

    Vendor Wang Xianlong, Nan Zhao Town, Ying Shang County, Anhui Province

    Editor's Note: After receiving Wang Xianlong's letter on September 6th, this newspaper immediately sent a letter to the Ying Shang County Committee of the Communist Party of China requesting an investigation and handling of the matter. In mid-October, the Ying Shang County Committee of the Communist Party of China informed us of the preliminary investigation results, confirming that the situation reflected by Wang Xianlong was completely true. At the end of November, the Ying Shang County Committee of the Communist Party of China reported the results of the handling: they have held a mass meeting in Nan Zhao Town, removed Yang Yubao from his post, and announced the cancellation of the supervision of Chen. Yang Yubao was expelled from the Party (currently being submitted to the prefectural committee for approval). District Committee Secretary Fu Yuebo has now been transferred to the county for reflection and is preparing to combine with other issues to deal with them together during Party rectification. Gao Shixun, the town mayor of Nan Zhao Town, was also given the punishment of removal from office.

    This incident shows that the bad practices of abusing power, bullying the masses, and violating laws and regulations still exist in some cadres. This is absolutely not allowed. It should be pointed out that all state organ cadres must establish a revolutionary work style of serving the people. They should be loyal servants of the people, not the "masters" of the people. If anyone still attempts to use the work powers given by the people to bully the people, they will inevitably be sanctioned by the people and state laws. If the leading organs do not engage in a serious struggle against this kind of behavior that endangers the interests of the people, it will inevitably lead to the danger of being divorced from the masses. We suggest that the Party and government leading organs of Ying Shang County attach importance to this incident. In addition to making appropriate handling of the personnel involved, they should also conduct extensive education among cadres at all levels in conjunction with rural Party rectification and government building, thoroughly inspect and correct the bad practices that remain in some cadres. As for the medical expenses incurred by Chen, the government should be responsible for paying them. The government should also provide appropriate care to Wang Xianlong for the impact on his business due to this incident, which has caused difficulties in his family life.

### 颍上南照镇农会主任杨玉保不该利用职权欺压群众

    颍上南照镇农会主任杨玉保不该利用职权欺压群众
    编辑同志：我是一个小摊贩，现在安徽省颍上县南照镇摆小摊过活。今年五月一日，南照镇农会主任杨玉保挟嫌报复，在枪决反革命分子时，将我女人陈氏拉去“陪斩”，并宣布管制二年，将她惊吓成病。我特向报社控诉，请上级政府派员彻底调查了解，保障她的生命，并纠正这种欺压群众的恶劣作风。
    事情经过是这样的：今年二月，杨玉保主任借我的自行车骑，将车子掉在水里，胎内帆布烂坏，把车弄得不成样子。我妻无意中将这件事和人家谈起过。杨主任知道了，很生气。他第二次来借车子时，我妻没借。他就此怀恨在心。四月间，因治淮雇民工修堤，由街上商民自愿摊派。开会时，我妻自报愿出二分半。杨主任强迫她出三分。她不愿出，并说杨主任不公平。杨主任生气了，将她扣押起来。她也气了，就把土地改革干部多分果实的事说了，她说：“你领导穷人翻身的，为什么和你有亲戚关系的，当干部的，都分到好房子；贫雇农倒分不到，分到也是坏的。这不是不公是什么？”杨主任就更生气了，决定要“治”她一下。六天以后，正是“五一”劳动节，镇上开庆祝大会，并公审反革命犯。群众都去开会，她也去了。公审大会开始后，号召群众检举反革命分子。杨主任布置了人检举我妻，捏造了五大罪状：一、她是妓女、二流子；二、做生意恶买恶卖；三、骂四周邻居；四、破坏土地改革；五、不出工分，破坏治淮。区委书记傅月波就把她叫上台去，上了手铐，命令她和反革命犯
    一齐面朝北跪着，不准她发言，并由人民法庭宣布管制二年。散会时，民兵拉着她，强迫跑步回镇。当时她已怀孕五个月，走不快。民兵们在杨主任的指示下，一人拉住手铐；一人用鞋子按住她的嘴，用脚乱踢，一人用枪乱打。她被连打带吓，鞋子、袜子都跑掉了，人也吓成呆子，不会说话了。当晚，区委书记傅月波派人把我找去，说：“你的老婆太坏，骂干部。我们是为了教育她。现在你将她带回去吧，要好好教育她，不要叫她死了。如果死了，你要负责任。”天黑时，我将她领回去，她已不会走路了。第二天，她全身青黑肿胀，疼痛难忍，痛哭流涕。我请医生医治，医生说她恐怕要小产。我请邻人及医生多人照顾，吃了药，才未小产。我为她不能经营生意，一百多万元资金都用完了，还欠下债。一家四口（两个小孩），每天只有暗自啼哭。她每天头晕腰痛，还要寻死，我一天到晚不能离开她。我想向上级控诉，恐怕又会遭到报复。无奈特向报社写信，请你们转达有关上级政府，速派员实际调查，为我申诉这个不白之冤。
    安徽省颍上县南照镇摊贩  王显隆
    编者按：九月六日本报收到王显隆这一封信后，当即函请中共颍上县委员会调查处理。十月中，中共颍上县委员会将初步调查情况告诉我们，证实王显隆所反映的情况是完全真实的。十一月底，中共颍上县委员会来信报告了处理结果：他们已在南照镇召开群众大会，将杨玉保撤职，同时宣布对陈氏取消管制。党内开除杨玉保出党（现正呈请地委批准）。区委书记傅月波，现已调县反省，准备结合其他问题，在整党时，一并处理。南照镇镇长高士勋也给予撤职处分。
    从这一事件说明，利用职权、欺压群众、违法乱纪的坏作风，至今还存在于某些干部的身上。这是绝对不能允许的。应该指出：一切国家机关干部都必须树立为人民服务的革命工作作风，他们应该是人民忠实的勤务员，而不是人民的“老爷”。如果还有人企图利用人民给予的工作职权来欺压人民，这就必然要受到人民和国家法纪的制裁。如果领导机关对这种危害人民利益的作风不作严肃的斗争，势必发生脱离群众的危险。我们建议颍上县党、政领导机关重视这一事件，除对有关人员作适当处理外，并应结合农村整党和建政工作，在各级干部中进行广泛教育，彻底检查并纠正残存在某些干部身上的恶劣作风。至于陈氏所用的医药费，应由政府负责开支。王显隆因此事而影响营业，致使家庭生活发生困难，政府亦应适当予以照顾。
