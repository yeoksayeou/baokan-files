Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The "Soviet Film Exhibition," held in sixty-seven cities across the country, has successfully concluded. From November 7th to December 6th, a total of more than 46,000 screenings were held, with an audience of over 40 million people. Touring screening teams and slideshow teams, deeply penetrating mines, rural areas, and remote regions, traversed thousands of mountains and rivers, screening color films such as "A Happy Life" and "The Visit of the Chinese Farmers Delegation to the Soviet Union," and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

The enthusiasm of the audience for this Soviet Film Exhibition was unprecedented. In many cities, the cumulative number of viewers exceeded the total local population. In Jiamusi City, Songjiang Province, the cumulative number of viewers was nearly three times the city's population. In Chengdu, Sichuan Province, with a population of only 700,000, the cinemas sold more than 1.38 million tickets. In Nanping Cinema, Nanping County, Fujian Province, the number of viewers for Soviet films screened for over twenty days was equal to the number of viewers in the past six months. In Henan Province, thirty-five film screening teams went deep into the countryside for touring screenings, reaching an audience of 1.8 million people. In Huangzhang Township, Feixi County, Anhui Province, with only one slideshow projector, screenings were often held in dark rooms during the day, in addition to evening screenings, due to the large number of viewers. In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people to watch Soviet films, special train carriages were added along the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan railway line—between Jinzhou, Dalinghe, and Xingcheng—to transport farmers to Jinzhou to see movies. Afang Palace Cinema in Xi'an even set up a temporary daycare center to take care of mothers watching movies. Many people who had never seen a movie before saw one during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." An old lady in Mudanjiang City, Songjiang Province, shed tears of joy after watching a Soviet film. She said: "I am over sixty years old and have never seen a movie. This time I saw one, and I also saw Chairman Mao and Stalin. It makes me so happy."

The happy life of the Soviet working people and the advanced production and construction of the Soviet Union, as portrayed in the Soviet films, gave the audience a huge impetus, and everyone is taking practical actions to learn from the model figures and advanced experiences in the Soviet films. Yang Weibao, a worker in the reverberatory furnace workshop of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, was deeply moved after watching the Soviet film "Donbass Miners." He immediately resolved to diligently study copper smelting work, reducing the time required to melt a furnace of copper from eight hours to six hours. In Dongxinzhuang, District 12, Xi'an City, seven peasant households, after seeing the happy life of the farmers in the Soviet Spark Collective Farm in a slideshow, realized the benefits of collective labor and, after consultation and discussion, have organized mutual aid teams. Some cadres in the secretarial section of the China Mineral Company's Central and Southern District Office in Wuhan, due to their satisfaction with their existing achievements and a lack of the spirit of bold reform, had hindered the implementation of rationalization proposals. After watching the Soviet film "Gold Star Hero," they criticized this conservative thinking, simplified work procedures, and recently saved nearly half of their manpower.

Soviet films have provided education in various aspects to the broad masses of the people. After watching Soviet films, people have held forums and informal discussions to learn and discuss. At a forum on the Soviet film "In Days of Peace," Wang Qiu'e, a worker at the No. 33 Cigarette Factory in Baoding City, said: "I feel that the spirit of Panichuk in 'In Days of Peace' of sacrificing personal interests for the interests of the motherland will always be a model for us to learn from. I seem to see him as soon as I close my eyes. Our factory is promoting the Kovalev work method, and watching this film has further strengthened my determination to overcome difficulties." The peasant masses have been deeply educated about the socialist and communist future through Soviet films. Many farmers said at forums: In the past, I heard that Soviet farmers lived well and used machines to cultivate the land, and I didn't quite believe it. After watching Soviet films, I really believe it. As long as we organize ourselves and work hard, we will definitely be able to live like Soviet farmers in the future. When discussing their impressions of the film "Soviet Uzbekistan" in Yinchuan City, the Hui people all agreed that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the various ethnic minority regions in China should strive to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, and in the future, they will be built as beautiful and prosperous as Uzbekistan.

    “苏联影片展览”圆满结束
    【新华社九日讯】在全国六十七个城市举办的“苏联影片展览”已圆满结束。自十一月七日到十二月六日一个月中，总共放映四万六千多场，观众达四千万人以上。深入到矿山、农村、边远地区的巡回放映队和幻灯队，跋涉千山万水，放映了“幸福的生活”、“中国农民代表团访苏经过”等彩色影片，受到广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    这次苏联影片展览观众的踊跃是从来未有的。许多城市的观众累计数都超过了当地人口总数。松江省佳木斯市观众累计数将近该市人口的三倍。四川省成都市只有七十万人，但电影院售出的座票共有一百三十八万多张。福建省南平县南平电影院放映苏联影片二十多天的观众人数，等于过去半年的观众人数。河南省三十五个电影放映队深入农村巡回放映，观众达一百八十万人；安徽省肥西县黄张乡只有一架幻灯机，由于看的人多，除在晚上放映以外，白天也常在暗室里放映。为了满足广大人民群众观看苏联电影的要求，东北沈山铁路沿线——锦州、大凌河、兴城之间加挂了包车，专门接送农民到锦州去看电影。西安市阿房宫电影院为了照顾看电影的母亲们，还特别设立了临时托儿所。很多从未看过电影的人，在“中苏友好月”中看到了。松江省牡丹江市有一个老太太看了苏联电影后高兴得眼泪也流了出来。她说：“我六十多岁从未看过电影，这次看到了，还看见了毛主席和斯大林，真使我太高兴了。”
    苏联影片中所表现的苏联劳动人民的幸福生活和苏联先进的生产建设，给予观众以巨大的鼓动力量，大家都以实际行动来向苏联影片中的模范人物和先进经验学习。沈阳市冶炼厂反射车间工人杨维宝看了苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”后深为感动，他立即下决心努力钻研烧铜工作，使原来需要八小时熔化一炉铜缩减到六小时。西安市十二区东辛庄有七户农民在幻灯片上看到苏联火花集体农庄农民的幸福生活后，认识到集体劳动的好处，经过协商讨论，已经组织起了互助组。武汉市中国矿产公司中南区办事处秘书科有些干部，过去由于满足现有成绩，缺乏大胆改革工作的精神，因而阻碍了合理化建议的实现。他们看了苏联影片“金星英雄”后，批判了这种保守思想，简化了工作手续，最近节约了近二分之一的人力。
    苏联影片对广大人民进行了各方面的教育。人们看过苏联电影后，纷纷举行座谈会和漫谈会，进行学习和讨论。在一个座谈苏联影片“在和平的日子里”的会上，保定市三三烟厂工人王秋娥说：“我感到‘在和平的日子里’的巴尼楚克为祖国利益牺牲个人利益的精神，永远是我们学习的榜样。我一合眼就好像看见了他一样。我们厂正在推行郭瓦廖夫工作法，看了这部影片，更增强了我克服困难的决心。”农民群众从苏联影片中深刻地受到了社会主义共产主义前途的教育。很多农民在座谈会上说：过去听说苏联农民生活好，用机器耕田，总有些不相信。看了苏联电影后，才真相信了。我们只要组织起来好好干，将来一定能和苏联农民一样。银川市回族人民在座谈“苏维埃乌兹别克斯坦”影片的观感时，大家都认为中国各少数民族地区在中国共产党领导下，努力学习苏联先进经验，将来一定会建设得像乌兹别克斯坦那样美丽和富庶。
