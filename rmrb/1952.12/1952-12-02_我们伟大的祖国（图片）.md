Our Great Motherland

One of the keys to accelerating capital construction is to send outstanding personnel to the capital construction departments. This is Song Yongkuan, a young locomotive driver from the Fuxin Open-pit Coal Mine. He was originally a communications worker in an office. After participating in the capital construction work of the mine, he was selected as the leader of the locomotive driver team in a very short period of time, created a working method that speeds up operation by five kilometers, and became a banner for safe driving for all drivers in the mine.
