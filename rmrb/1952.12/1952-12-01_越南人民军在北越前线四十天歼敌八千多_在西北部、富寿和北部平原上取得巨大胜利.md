Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 27th. According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army told reporters on November 23rd that within forty days from October 14th, the Vietnamese People's Army forces had annihilated 8,500 enemy soldiers and officers on the North Vietnamese front alone.

The spokesperson said that the recent military situation in North Vietnam has the following three characteristics:

(1) Our troops have crossed the Black River, broken through the enemy's defense line on the right bank of the Black River, and liberated the provincial capital of Son La Province, almost the entire area of Son La Province, and three districts of Lai Chau Province.

(2) The enemy launched a defensive offensive towards Phu Tho, attempting to cut off our supply lines and establish their defense line on the right bank of the Black River, but they failed and suffered severe blows.

(3) Our troops, taking advantage of the enemy's inability to hide in the plains of North Vietnam, intensified operations there and achieved many victories.

According to incomplete statistics, in the short forty days since the attack on enemy positions on October 14th (the day the Nghia Lo Campaign began), the People's Army forces have annihilated more than 8,500 enemy troops on the North Vietnamese front alone. Among them, 4,500 enemy troops were annihilated on the Northwest front, 3,000 enemy troops were annihilated in the North Vietnamese plains, and more than 1,000 enemy troops were annihilated in Phu Tho.

The spokesperson said: The great victories we have achieved in the past few weeks clearly expose the lies of colonialists Letourneau (French High Commissioner to Indochina) and Salan (French Commander of Colonial Forces in Indochina). They boasted: "We have taken the initiative, and the Viet Minh army is absolutely incapable of attacking our Northwest base."

The spokesperson finally said that the great victories we have achieved in the Northwest, Phu Tho, and the North Vietnamese plains prove that the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Government of Vietnam, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army is wise and firm; they have seen through all the enemy's conspiracies, thus causing the enemy to suffer serious defeats. The attainment of these victories should also be attributed to the efforts and determination of our army and logistics personnel to overcome difficulties, as well as the patriotism and shared hatred of our Thai compatriots and other ethnic minorities in the Northwest—these compatriots warmly welcomed and actively helped the army to eliminate the enemy.

However, in victory, we should remember President Ho Chi Minh's teaching: Do not be arrogant and complacent and underestimate the enemy. The enemy can still carry out fierce mopping-up operations in the plains and air raids on our liberated areas. Therefore, we should continue to work hard to eliminate more enemy manpower and actively increase production and practice economy, so as to further increase our strength for prolonged resistance.

    越南人民军在北越前线四十天歼敌八千多
    在西北部、富寿和北部平原上取得巨大胜利
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十七日讯：越南人民军总司令部量。发言人于十一月二十三日对记者发表谈话说，越南人民军部队在从十月十四日起的四十天以内，单在北越前线就歼灭了敌军士兵和军官八千五百人。
    发言人说，最近北越的军事形势有下面三个特点：
    （一）我军部队已经渡过黑水江，攻破黑水江右岸的敌军防线，解放了山萝省省会、山萝省的差不多全部地区以及莱州省的三个地区。
    （二）敌军曾向富寿发动过一次守势进攻，企图切断我军的供应线并在黑水江右岸建立起他们的防线，但是他们没有得逞，而且遭到严重的打击。
    （三）我军部队利用敌军在北越平原上无法隐蔽的弱点，在那里加紧作战，获得许多次胜利。
    根据不完全的统计，在十月十四日（按：义路战役开始的一天）对敌军阵地进行攻击以来的短短四十天中，人民军部队单单在北越前线就歼灭了敌军八千五百人以上。其中，在西北战线上歼灭了敌军四千五百人，在北越平原歼灭了敌军三千人，在富寿歼灭了敌军一千多人。
    发言人说：我军在过去几星期中获得的巨大胜利，清楚地揭露了殖民者勒都尔诺（法国驻印度支那高级专员）和萨兰（法国在印度支那的殖民地军司令）的谎言。他们曾吹嘘说：“我们已取得主动，越盟军绝对无力进攻我们的西北基地。”
    发言人最后说，我们在西北部、富寿和北越平原上取得的巨大胜利，证明胡志明主席、越南人民政府、越南劳动党中央委员会和越南人民军总司令部的领导是很英明而坚定的；他们识破了敌人的一切阴谋，从而使敌人遭受严重的失败。这些胜利的获得也应当归功于我们军队和后勤工作人员克服困难的努力和决心以及我们泰族同胞和西北部的其他少数民族同胞热爱祖国和同仇敌忾的精神——这些同胞热烈欢迎并积极帮助军队消灭敌军。
    但是我们在胜利的时候应当记起胡志明主席的教训：不要骄傲自满和低估敌人。敌人仍然能够在平原进行猛烈的扫荡战，对我们解放区进行空袭。因此我们应当继续努力，消灭更多的敌军有生力量，积极增产节约，借以进一步增加我们长期抗战的力量。
