    I Have Confidence in Completing the New Task Entrusted to Me by the People
    To the Editor: The motherland's large-scale economic construction is about to begin. To adapt to this need, the Electricity Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry adjusted its organization and established the North China Electricity Administration. The government appointed me as deputy director. When accepting this glorious and important task, I felt ashamed because my progress had not kept up with the needs of the Party and the people. However, I have confidence, because from the past five or six years of work, I have deeply realized that under the leadership of the Party and in the face of the working class, there are no insurmountable difficulties.
    In 1947, in Harbin, due to the enemy's attacks, our material conditions were very poor, but the worker brothers in Harbin, under the leadership of the Party, finally overcame numerous difficulties and merged two damaged generators together to generate electricity to support the front line and consolidate the rear. In 1950, I was transferred to the Shijingshan Power Plant as the director. In the past three years, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the efforts of all employees, we have carried out a series of production reforms in this power plant, basically eliminated accidents, and reduced costs by 50.84% compared to the early days of liberation, preparing for the motherland's large-scale economic construction. This time, I was promoted to deputy director of the North China Electricity Administration. I know that this responsibility is even greater and the difficulties will be even more numerous, but I am determined to strengthen learning and work hard to complete the task entrusted to me by the people.
    In addition to me, many cadres are leaving the Shijingshan Power Plant this time. The comrades who remain at the plant are not afraid of heavy burdens. They warmly send us off, because everyone hopes that more thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants will appear in the motherland in the near future, supplying electricity for industrial use and people's lives.

    我有信心完成人民交给我的新任务
    编辑同志：祖国大规模的经济建设就要开始了。为适应这个需要，燃料工业部电业总局调整了机构，成立了华北电业管理局，政府委派我做了副局长。当接受这个光荣而又重大的任务的时候，我感到惭愧，因为自己的进步还赶不上党和人民的需要。但是，我是有信心的，因为从五、六年来的工作中，我深刻地体会到了在党的领导下，在工人阶级面前，没有克服不了的困难。
    一九四七年，在哈尔滨的时候，由于敌人的进攻，我们的物质条件非常恶劣，但哈尔滨的工人弟兄们，在党的领导下，终于克服了重重困难，把两台被破坏了的发电机合并在一起，发出电来支援前线，巩固后方。一九五○年，调我到石景山发电厂当厂长。三年来，由于党的领导，全体职工的努力，我们已经在这个发电厂中进行了一系列的生产改革，基本上消灭了事故，成本较解放初期降低了百分之五十点八四，为祖国大规模经济建设做好准备工作。这次提拔我到华北电业管理局做副局长，我知道这个责任是更重大的，困难也会更多的，但是我决心以加强学习努力工作来完成人民交给我的任务。
    除我以外，这次还有许多干部离开石景山发电厂。留厂工作的同志，不怕担子重。他们热烈地欢送我们，因为大家都希望祖国在不久的将来出现更多的火力发电厂和水力发电厂，供给工业用电和人民生活用电。　工业劳动模范　刘英源
