    To Comrade Soong Ching Ling, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, forwarded to the World People's Peace Congress:
    At a time when the American aggressors are frantically plotting to use the banner of the United Nations to continue and expand the Korean War, and when the victory of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference demonstrates the further upsurge of the world peace movement, the convening of the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna has extremely important historical significance.
    The Chinese people are determined to fight resolutely to the end to defend peace. The deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a powerful guarantee of world peace. Soon after the closing of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, the Chinese people launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement throughout the country, which made a beneficial contribution to the cause of defending world peace.
    On the happy occasion of the convening of the World People's Peace Congress, we, on behalf of more than 38 million members of this association, extend our warm congratulations to the congress and wish the congress success.
    Qian Junrui, Director-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, December 11th

    出席世界人民和平大会中国代表团团长宋庆龄转世界人民和平大会：
    当美国侵略者疯狂地阴谋利用联合国的旗帜，继续和扩大朝鲜战争的时候，当亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利显示了世界和平运动进一步高涨的时候，世界人民和平大会在维也纳的召开，有着极其重大的历史意义。
    中国人民决心为保卫和平坚决斗争到底。中国人民和苏联人民的深厚友谊是世界和平的有力保证。在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议闭幕后不久，中国人民即在全国范围内展开了空前热烈的“中苏友好月”运动，这对于保卫世界和平事业，作了有益的贡献。
    欣逢世界人民和平大会召开之际，谨代表本会三千八百余万会员，向大会致热烈的祝贺，并预祝大会成功。
