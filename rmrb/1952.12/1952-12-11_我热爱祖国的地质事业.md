    I Love the Motherland's Geological Undertaking
    Chen Yu
    I am proud to be a student of the Beijing Institute of Geology. Because I am a student of a new type of higher education institution that takes the Soviet Union as its teacher.
    In high school, many classmates asked me: "Why do you want to study geology?" At that time, I couldn't answer this question. I was influenced by a teacher to aspire to a career in geology; as for why study it, and what would happen after graduation, I was completely clueless. When I was a child studying geography, I saw many markings on foreign mineral maps, but the mineral maps of the motherland were too simple. I wondered, don't we have many "world's firsts"? Tungsten in Jiangxi, antimony in Hunan, mercury in Guizhou... I didn't believe that the motherland's mineral resources were so few, they just hadn't been discovered yet. I thought, when I grow up, I must go find them! But how to find them? I couldn't get an answer either. When I graduated from junior high school, I didn't even know what geology was. After entering high school, a geologist told us that geology is not the magic used by treasure hunters in legends, nor is it a dry and boring metaphysics of playing with nouns. It is a highly scientific science that arouses people's strong research interest. Its content is very rich, including mineralogy, paleontology, petrology, ore deposit geology, structural geology... Along with the strong interest in geology came a series of questions: Can I go to university to study? Where will the money come from? Will it be useful after graduation? At that time, I couldn't figure out these questions.
    After liberation, first of all, the high development of Soviet geological science illuminated my path. Under the special attention and support of the government, Soviet geology has made such great progress in just over ten years after the revolution: the number of geologists has increased sharply from hundreds to more than 20,000, the area of exploration has increased more than seventy times, potash salts have been discovered in the Ural Mountains, the Baku oil fields have been expanded, and an oil sea has been discovered at a depth of 2,000 meters in the Ural Mountains. This is a fact, indeed a fact! This made me know that the people's country loves science and scientists. This made me feel: the present of the Soviet Union is our tomorrow!
    The motherland's urgent need for geological workers encourages me a hundredfold. This made me know that now is the time when the people of the whole country eagerly demand that young people quickly participate in the study of geological science, and demand that geological workers enthusiastically devote themselves to the great construction cause of the motherland! The geological workers needed by the motherland are not hundreds or thousands, but tens of thousands... The people's century is also the century of the motherland's geological science rebirth!
    Iron and copper mines were discovered in the Northeast, oil mines were discovered in the Northwest, iron mines were discovered in East China, and phosphate mines were discovered in Nanjing... Since liberation, news of the discovery of underground treasures in the motherland has been reported one after another in newspapers and magazines. The hard work of the motherland's geological workers shines with brilliant light. All these powerfully told me that the motherland's resources are truly "inexhaustible and inexhaustible."
    The great development of Soviet socialist geological undertakings encourages me, the urgent need of the motherland's construction calls me, and Chairman Mao educates me. I have made up my mind to study geological science and prepare to participate in the motherland's great construction cause.
    This year, the list of new students admitted to universities was announced. When I saw that I had been admitted to the Beijing Institute of Geology, I was extremely happy! I came to the Beijing Institute of Geology with the most excited mood in my life. At present, this is a new type of geological institute that cannot be found in any country in the world except the Soviet Union.
    I love my school. Our classroom is the vast land of the motherland, and our textbook is the motherland's infinite treasures. We currently have more than 1,500 students. We are building new school buildings in the capital. The future geological institute building has a comfortable working environment for teachers, and classrooms that can accommodate 8,000 students and dormitories that can accommodate 8,000 students. Our professors are actively learning advanced Soviet teaching experience, and their slogan is: "Ensure that every student is taught well, so that they can independently shoulder the tasks entrusted to them by the motherland as soon as they leave school!" We students love each other. The motherland gives us meticulous care, and we have all enjoyed scholarships. The school's concern for students is also meticulous. A student from the South was temporarily unable to adapt to the northern climate and his feet were frozen. The school immediately bought him cotton shoes and repeatedly comforted him. I understand: even true maternal love is only like this. Our school leaders and teachers love us so much. They wholeheartedly and enthusiastically cultivate us so that we become geological construction talents with "both morality and talent, and sound physique." The scale of the motherland's economic construction is very huge, and tens of thousands of specialized construction talents are needed. In basic construction, a large number of geological talents are especially needed. When I think that in a few years I will become an engineer who "turns deserts into fertile fields and turns barren mountains into mines," my heart is filled with happiness and joy. And all this is given to me by our dear Chairman Mao. I sincerely thank Chairman Mao.
    I feel so happy to be born in the era of Mao Zedong. I often laughingly think of what my mother said before liberation: "Don't study geology! What's the use!" I can't blame my mother. In those years, she couldn't have imagined that the motherland's geological undertaking would have such a magnificent future.
    Tens of thousands of years ago, our ancestors used to grind stones into stone knives. At that time, the difficulties in the work were really difficult for us to imagine now. I know that it is still a difficult thing for us to do such work now. I am willing to dedicate my whole life to the geological undertaking of my beloved motherland. Today, I must actively study hard and master geological science knowledge. Tomorrow, I will work selflessly on the fertile land of the motherland. We will build factories and grow watermelons and purple grapes in places that are still marked as "deserts" on today's maps. Let thousands of young people participate in the motherland's geological undertaking! Let the motherland's geological undertaking bloom countless brilliant flowers in the great economic construction!

    我热爱祖国的地质事业
    陈榆
    我为自己是北京地质学院的学生而骄傲。因为我是一个新型的以苏联为师的高等学校的学生。
    在高中时，许多同学问我：“你为什么要学地质学呢？”那时候我不能回答这个问题。我是受了一位老师的影响而有志于地质事业的；至于为什么学，学成以后又怎么样，却完全茫然。小时念地理课，看见许多外国的矿产图上有很多的记号，而祖国的矿产图上呢，那就太简单了。我奇怪，我们不是有着许多的“世界第一”吗？江西的钨，湖南的锑，贵州的汞……。我不相信祖国的矿产是这样少的，只是未曾发掘而已。我想，等我大起来，我一定要找去！但是怎样找呢？也得不到答案。初中毕业时，我还不知道地质学倒底是什么东西。升入高中以后，有一位地质学家告诉我们，地质学并不是传说中采宝者们所用的魔术，更不是枯燥乏味的和玩弄名词的玄学，这是一门有高度科学性的、会引起人们浓厚研究兴趣的科学。它的内容非常丰富，包括矿物学、古生物学、岩石学、矿床学、构造地质学……。随着对于地质学发生浓厚兴趣而来的，是一连串的问题：能到大学去念书吗？那里来钱呢？学成了是否有用呢？那时，这些问题我都弄不清楚。
    解放后，首先是苏联地质科学的高度发展照明了我的道路。苏联地质学在政府的特别注意和支持下，仅在革命后的十多年间，就有了这样大的发展：地质学家由几百人骤增到二万多人，勘察的面积增加了七十多倍，乌拉山的钾盐被发现了；巴库的油田也被扩大了；并在乌拉山的二千公尺深处发现了油海。这是事实，确实是事实！这使我知道了人民的国家是热爱科学和科学家们的。这使我感到：苏联的现在，就是我们的明天呀！
    祖国对于地质工作者的迫切需要，百倍地鼓舞着我。这使我知道，现在是全国人民热切地要求青年们赶快参加地质科学的学习，要求地质工作者们热情地投入祖国的伟大建设事业的时代了！祖国需要的地质工作者不是几百、几千，而是几万，……人民的世纪，也就是祖国地质科学再生的世纪！
    东北发现了铁矿和铜矿，西北发现了油矿，华东发现了铁矿，南京发现了磷矿……解放以来，祖国地下宝藏被发现的消息接二连三地在报纸和杂志上报道出来。祖国地质工作者们辛勤的工作闪耀着灿烂的光辉。这些都有力地告诉了我，祖国的资源真是“取之不尽，用之不竭”的。
    苏联社会主义地质事业的巨大发展鼓舞着我，祖国建设的迫切需要召唤着我，毛主席教育着我，我下定了决心学习地质科学，准备参加祖国伟大的建设事业。
    今年高等学校的新生录取名单公布了，当我看到自己已被录取在北京地质学院时，我快乐极了！我以平生最兴奋的心情来到了北京地质学院。目前，除苏联以外，这是在世界上任何国家都找不到的、新型的地质学院。
    我爱我的学校。我们的课堂是祖国辽阔的大地，我们的课本就是祖国无穷的宝藏。我们现在有一千五百多名同学。我们正在首都建筑新校舍，未来的地质学院大楼，有着老师们的安适的工作环境，有着可容纳八千同学上课的教室和八千同学住宿的宿舍。我们的教授正在积极地学习苏联先进教学经验，他们的口号是：“保证教好每一个同学，使他们一出校门就能独立地担负祖国付托的任务！”我们同学之间相亲相爱。祖国给我们以无微不至的照顾，我们已经全部享受助学金。学校对于同学的关怀也是无微不至的。有一个南方来的同学，一时还不能适应北方的气候，脚冻了，学校立即给他买棉鞋，还再三地慰问他。我懂得：就是真挚的母爱也只有如此。我们的学校领导者和老师是那么爱护我们，他们全心全意地无限热情地培养着我们，使我们成为“德才兼备，体魄健全”的地质建设人材。祖国经济建设的规模是非常巨大的，需要数以万计的专门建设人材，在基本建设中，尤其需要大量的地质人材，当我想到几年后我就要成为“变沙漠为良田，变荒山为矿井”的工程师时，我的心里充满了幸福和喜悦。而这一切都是亲爱的毛主席给予我的，我衷心地感谢毛主席。
    我觉得太幸福了，能生长在毛泽东的时代。我时常好笑地想到母亲在解放以前的话：“不要学地质吧！有什么用呢！”这不能怪妈妈，在那样的年月，她不可能想到祖国的地质事业有这样壮丽的前程。
    几万年前，我们祖先曾把石块磨成石刀，那时候，工作中的困难实在是我们现在所难以想像的；我知道，我们现在来做这样的工作，也仍然是一件艰巨的事情，我愿意用全部生命献给我热爱的祖国的地质事业。今天我要积极努力学习，掌握地质科学知识；明天我要忘我地劳动在祖国丰饶的沃土上，我们要使今天地图上还是“沙漠”符号的地方，盖起工厂来，长出西瓜和紫葡萄来。让成千上万的青年参加祖国的地质事业吧！让祖国的地质事业在伟大的经济建设中开放出无数灿烂的花朵吧！
