Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 27th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, at its plenary session held from December 5th to 7th, passed a resolution on disciplining André Marty and Charles Tillon.

    The plenary session discussed Léon Mauvais' report on the "Sectarian Activities of André Marty and Charles Tillon." As is known, due to the exposure of Marty and Tillon's sectarian activities, the previous plenary session held in early September unanimously agreed to remove Tillon from his position as a member of the Political Bureau and Marty from his position as Secretary of the Central Committee, and instructed Marty and Tillon to conduct honest and open self-criticism. After extensive discussions in the various branches of the French Communist Party, the aforementioned decision was also unanimously agreed upon. However, Marty and Tillon did not abide by their promises, and instead of honestly and openly admitting their mistakes before the Party, they deceived the Party by concealing and covering up their anti-Party sectarian actions.

    The materials revealed during the French Communist Party Central Committee's discussions at the meeting showed that Marty and Tillon had been carrying out sectarian activities against the Party's line for many years. Even during the war, they pushed the Party onto the path of left-leaning adventurist actions, which could only lead to the failure of the French national liberation movement. Later, during the national resistance movement, they tried to minimize the role of the French Communist Party and the Party's leadership headed by Maurice Thorez. Marty and Tillon tended to underestimate the Soviet Union's role in the liberation of France, a view that could only arise from bourgeois nationalism. After the well-known conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties in 1947, Marty expressed disagreement with the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference of Representatives of Nine European Communist and Workers' Parties in 1947, as well as the conference's assessment of the international situation. He placed the fact that France was subjugated to US imperialism in second place and also underestimated the role of the right-wing socialist leaders, who were tools of US imperialism. Tillon opposed the expansion of the peace movement in France. Marty and Tillon undermined the Party's line of contact with the masses, isolating the Party. Marty even maintained private contacts with police elements.

    Marty and Tillon did not attend the plenary session of the French Communist Party Central Committee.

    The plenary session decided: 1. To remove André Marty from all leading positions, to remove him from all positions within the Party, and to remove him from his positions as a member of the Political Bureau and a member of the Central Committee. Marty's letters and statements to the Political Bureau are an anti-Party program, and therefore his actions in disseminating these letters and statements are condemned. Marty violated the Party's principles, policies, and discipline, and maintained contact with police elements, therefore, the issue of his Party membership should be reviewed by his Party organization. 2. In view of the serious mistakes made by Charles Tillon and his refusal to conduct honest and sincere self-criticism, it was decided to remove him from all leading positions, to remove him from all positions within the Party, and to remove him from his position as a member of the Central Committee.

    法共中央举行全会
    通过处分马尔梯、狄戎的决议
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会在十二月五日至七日举行的全体会议上通过了关于处分安德烈·马尔梯和夏尔·狄戎的决议。
    全体会议讨论了利昂·摩维关于“安德烈·马尔梯和夏尔·狄戎的宗派活动”的报告。大家知道，由于马尔梯与狄戎的宗派活动被揭穿，九月初举行的上次全体会议曾一致同意撤除狄戎的政治局委员职务和马尔梯的中央委员会书记职务，并且责成马尔梯和狄戎进行诚实的、公开的自我批评。法国共产党各支部经过广泛讨论后，也一致同意上述决定。但是马尔梯和狄戎不遵守自己的诺言，不但不肯在党的面前诚实地公开承认错误，反而欺骗党，隐瞒和掩饰自己的反党的宗派行动。
    法国共产党中央委员会在会议讨论过程中揭发的材料表明：马尔梯和狄戎进行反对党的路线的宗派活动，已经有许多年了。远在战时，他们就把党推向采取左倾冒险主义行动的道路，这种行动只能使法国的民族解放运动失败。后来在民族抵抗运动时期中，他们又竭力缩小法国共产党和以莫里斯·多列士为首的党的领导机构的作用。马尔梯和狄戎有轻视苏联在法国解放中的作用的倾向，这种观点只有在资产阶级民族主义的基础上才会产生。在一九四七年召开的有名的共产党与工人党代表会议以后，马尔梯曾表示不同意一九四七年欧洲九国共产党与工人党代表华沙会议的决议以及会议上对国际局势的估计。他把法国屈从于美帝国主义这个事实放在第二位，而且还对作为美帝国主义的工具的右翼社会党领袖的作用估计不足。狄戎则反对在法国扩大和平运动。马尔梯和狄戎破坏了党和群众的联系的路线，使党陷于孤立。马尔梯甚至和警察分子维持着私人的联系。
    马尔梯和狄戎并没有出席法国共产党中央委员会全体会议。
    全体会议决定：一、撤除安德烈·马尔梯的一切领导职务，撤除他在党内的一切职务，撤除他的政治局委员和中央委员会委员的职务。马尔梯给政治局的信件和声明是反党的纲领，因此谴责马尔梯散布这些信件和声明的行动。马尔梯违反了党的原则、政策和纪律，并且和警察分子保持联系，因此，他的党籍问题应由他所属的党组织予以审查。二、鉴于夏尔·狄戎犯了严重的错误，并且拒绝进行诚实恳切的自我批评，决定撤除他的一切领导职务，撤除他在党内的一切职务，撤除他的中央委员会委员的职务。
