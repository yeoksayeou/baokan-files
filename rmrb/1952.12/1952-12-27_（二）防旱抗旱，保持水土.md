    (II) Prevent and Fight Drought, Conserve Water and Soil
    The instruction issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government on launching the masses to continue to carry out the movement to prevent and fight drought and vigorously promote soil and water conservation work, based on the existing experience of the drought prevention and drought resistance movement in various regions, pointed out the specific methods to overcome natural disasters and ensure the continuous bumper harvest of agricultural production.
    To prevent drought, we have done a lot of work. This year, the people of the whole country launched a large-scale drought prevention and drought resistance campaign, which has achieved great results and played a significant role in ensuring a bumper harvest throughout the country. However, drought is a historical problem in our country, and we are still likely to encounter drought at any time. Therefore, the State Council's call to continue the drought prevention and drought resistance movement is fully in line with actual needs.
    In the future drought prevention and drought resistance movement, all regions should draw on the experience of 1952 and make a comprehensive plan based on the crop planting and water supply situation in their respective regions. Wherever there is sufficient water source or the existing water conservancy facilities can be improved to solve the problem, efforts should be made to carry out preventive work. Where problems cannot be solved temporarily, preparations should be made for temporary drought resistance.
    Drought prevention must be approached from two aspects: one is to vigorously develop small-scale irrigation projects, such as digging wells, building ponds, building small reservoirs, digging diversion canals, and installing waterwheels and water pumps. In the current situation, the construction of small reservoirs is particularly important, and this project can be promoted in both the South and the North. It has a large water storage capacity, irrigates a wide area, and can also avoid the disaster of mountain floods. On the other hand, we should try our best to tap the potential power of existing water conservancy equipment, strengthen organization and management, and improve water use methods so that existing projects can play a greater role. In 1952, Guangli Canal in Pingyuan Province implemented measures such as contracted irrigation and shallow irrigation and ditch irrigation. Each cubic meter per second of water source irrigated 30,000 mu of land, increasing the irrigated area from 400,000 mu to 600,000 mu. In the waterwheel well irrigation area of Hebei Province, farmers organized their neighbors to implement public use and public repairs, taking turns to irrigate the land day and night, which improved the efficiency of water well irrigation. The irrigation area of a waterwheel well in Lixian County increased from more than 20 mu to a high of 150 mu. However, some areas still do not have the habit of taking turns to irrigate day and night, which shows that there is still great untapped potential in our existing water conservancy facilities. Therefore, in the future, new projects can only be carried out in places where existing equipment has been fully utilized. We must ensure that our financial and technical resources can be concentrated on newly built projects.
    The work of soil and water conservation is as important as drought prevention and drought resistance. It is necessary to stop the serious soil erosion in mountains and plateaus and change the natural appearance of mountainous areas. In most mountainous and plateau areas of our country, the soil is barren, and the area of farmland is shrinking, resulting in the long-term poverty of the people in mountainous areas. On the other hand, many rivers are frequently breached and flooded due to the accumulation of large amounts of sediment. According to a survey by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the amount of soil flowing into the Yellow River from the Wuding River, Yanshui River, Jingshui River, Weishui River, and Luoshui River in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is 800 million cubic meters per year, which is a great loss to agricultural production in the Shaanxi-Gansu Plateau and a very heavy burden on the dredging project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Many other rivers have the same situation. Now the large-scale and planned construction of the whole country is about to begin. In order to meet the needs of national industrialization, we must ensure the continuous bumper harvest of agricultural production in the whole country, and we must gradually build projects to eliminate harm and promote benefits in various rivers. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to vigorously conserve soil and water in mountainous and plateau areas and stop soil erosion, whether from the perspective of local or overall interests, or from the perspective of temporary or long-term interests.
    The key to carrying out the drought prevention and drought resistance movement and promoting soil and water conservation work is to organize and mobilize the strength of the masses. This work involves a very wide range and requires a lot of manpower. It is absolutely impossible to do it well without the participation of the broad masses. Since it is a mass mobilization and organization work, the responsible cadres of local administrative departments must take responsibility, implement the policy of relying on the masses, and oppose any forced orders, simply assigning tasks, and demanding figures. In the early stage of carrying out this work, do not rush to expand the scope and do not disperse forces, but concentrate on solving problems in a focused manner. For example, in one area, first concentrate sufficient forces to work on the upper reaches of a river, and you will receive the due effect.
    In order to realize these two important tasks, we must prepare early and start immediately. Necessary and possible projects should be started this winter, and preparations should be made for construction in the spring of next year. We must change the past habits, change winter leisure into winter busyness, grasp the agricultural season, and try to gain the initiative. Only in this way can we thoroughly implement the instructions of the State Council and do a good job in drought prevention, drought resistance, and soil and water conservation.

### （二）防旱抗旱，保持水土

    （二）防旱抗旱，保持水土
    中央人民政府政务院关于发动群众继续开展防旱抗旱运动并大力推行水土保持工作的指示，根据各地防旱抗旱运动已有的经验，指出了克服自然灾害、保障农业生产经常丰收的具体方法。
    为了防止旱灾，我们已经做了许多工作。今年全国人民展开大规模的防旱抗旱运动，已取得了巨大成绩，对保障全国的丰收起了很大作用。但是，我国的旱灾是有历史性的，我们仍然随时有遭遇旱灾的可能。因此，政务院号召继续开展防旱抗旱运动，是完全符合实际需要的。
    在今后的防旱抗旱运动中，各地应该吸取一九五二年的经验，就本地区作物种植和水源供给的情况，做一个全面的筹划。凡是有足够的水源或者把现有的水利设施加以改进就可以解决问题的地方，应该抓紧时机进行预防的工作。暂时不能解决问题的地方，则应做临时抗旱的准备。
    防旱的工作必须从两方面着手：一方面是大量发展小型灌溉工程，如打井、挖塘、修筑小型水库、开挖引水渠道、安装水车和抽水机等。在目前情况下，修筑小型水库是特别重要的，这种工程在南方北方都可推广。它蓄水的容量大，灌溉的面积广，同时还可免除山洪暴发的灾害。另一方面，应该尽量发挥现有水利设备的潜在力量，加强组织和管理工作，改善用水方法，使现有工程发挥更大的效能。一九五二年平原省广利渠实行包浇和浅灌、沟灌等办法，每一秒公方的水源，浇地达三万亩，使灌溉面积从四十万亩增加到六十万亩。河北省水车井灌溉地区，农民组织地邻，实行公用公修，日夜轮流浇地，提高了水井浇地的效率。蠡县一眼水车井的浇地面积，从二十余亩增加到一百五十亩的高额。但是，有些地区至今还没有日夜轮浇的习惯，这说明在我们现有的水利设施中还存在着极大的没有发挥出来的潜在能力。因此，今后必须在现有设备已经充分发挥效能的地方，才可举办新的工程。我们必须使我们的财力和技术能够集中使用于新建的工程。
    与防旱抗旱有同等重要意义的工作是保持水土，制止山陵和高原地带严重的土壤冲蚀现象，改变山区的自然面貌。我国多数山陵高原地区，土壤瘠薄，农田面积缩小，致山区人民生活长期贫困。另一方面，许多河流因大量泥沙淤积，经常发生决口泛滥。据黄河水利委员会调查，黄河上游无定河、延水、泾水、渭水、洛水等河流，每年流进黄河的泥土，就有八万万立方公尺，这对陕甘高原的农业生产是极大的损失，而对黄河下游疏浚工程又是十分沉重的负担。其他许多河流也存在着同样的情况。现在全国大规模有计划的建设即将开始，为了适应国家工业化的需要，我们必须保障全国农业生产的经常丰收，必须在各个河流逐步修建除害兴利的工程。因此，在山陵和高原地区极力保持水土，制止土壤冲刷，无论就局部的或全局的利益来说，无论就暂时的或长远的利益来说，都是极为必要的。
    开展防旱抗旱运动和推行水土保持工作的关键是要组织和动员群众的力量。这种工作牵涉的范围极广，需用的人力很多，没有广大群众参加，是绝对不能作好的。既然是一个群众性的动员组织工作，那末，地方行政负责干部就必须负起责任，贯彻依靠群众的方针，任何强迫命令，单纯派任务、要数字的做法都要反对。在开展这一工作的初期，不要急于扩大范围，不要分散力量，而要集中地有重点地解决问题。如在一个地区，首先以足够的力量集中在一条河流的上游进行工作，就能收到应有的效果。
    为了实现这两项重要任务，必须及早准备，立即动手。今年冬季就应开始进行必要与可能的工程，并作好明年春季施工的准备工作。我们要改变过去的习惯，变冬闲为冬忙，掌握农事季节，尽量争取主动。只有这样，才能彻底实现政务院的指示，作好防旱抗旱和水土保持的工作。
