Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th—In November, heavy snow fell on the Korean front, and the weather was cold. The Korean-Chinese People's Army fought bravely against the enemy in the freezing weather, completely shattering Van Fleet’s offensive in the Shangganling area north of Kimhwa, and continued to launch tactical counterattacks, achieving significant victories. In November, our army engaged the enemy in a total of more than 220 battles, annihilating over 30,000 enemy troops.

The battle in the Shangganling area north of Kimhwa was the most intense battle on the entire front in November. Thanks to the heroic resistance of our army, the enemy's offensive from October 14th to the end of November has been completely shattered by us. The battle on the right side of Shangganling—Hill 597.9—basically ended by dusk on November 5th. After our army completely recaptured the positions on this hill before dawn on November 2nd, the enemy launched another fierce attack, attempting to seize this position. The intensity of the battle was no less than when the enemy initially launched the offensive. On that day, the enemy sent out more than 200 sorties of aircraft and fired more than 120,000 shells, covering their four infantry battalions in a frantic counterattack against us. Our army fought back heroically, fighting fiercely all day, and finally repelled the enemy. On the 3rd and 5th, the enemy continued to attack, but still failed. In these three days, the enemy suffered more than 3,000 casualties before retreating in the face of difficulty. From the 6th to the 13th, the enemy made two more probing attacks, which were also repelled by our army. On the left side of Shangganling—Hill 537.7, the main peak of this hill was the focus of the struggle between the two sides in early November. Since our army recovered all the positions on this hill in one fell swoop on the 11th, the enemy has reinforced its troops and attacked again, attacking continuously for four days, only managing to climb onto a small hillside. Since the 15th, the enemy's offensive has gradually weakened, and the battle on this hill has become a small battle for each position, with battles occurring intermittently, and the enemy has not been able to advance another step.

In the month and a half of the battle for Shangganling, the enemy has suffered more than 25,000 casualties, and the military supplies consumed are incalculable. Now, the wounds of the US invading army and its accomplice troops have not yet healed, but US generals are already clamoring for an offensive next spring. They are pinning all their "hopes" on the "amphibious operations" they dream of. If their interest is indeed very strong, and the past failures are not painful enough, then the Korean-Chinese People's Army has prepared everything, so please, US generals, come and try again.

In other areas of the front in November, the Korean-Chinese People's Army continued to carry out counterattacks, capturing 27 enemy positions ranging from squads to companies, three of which were company-level enemy positions. On the 9th, they captured a puppet army company position near Dakang-ri, south of Gao Cheng on the eastern front, and on the 10th, they captured a US army company position on the north mountain of Shixian Cave, west of Tieyuan on the western front. Both of these counterattacks ended within 20 minutes, and all the defending enemies were annihilated. On the 18th, two high grounds north of Gaolangpu-ri on the western front were captured, and a British army company was completely annihilated. In addition, our army in the central front also launched counterattacks on both sides of the Shangganling position, powerfully coordinating with the battle of Shangganling, capturing a total of nine enemy positions, and firmly occupying Hill 391 near Hetang-ri, northeast of Tieyuan.

In November, our army's mobile artillery fire on the front killed and wounded 6,036 enemy troops, and snipers annihilated 4,083 enemy troops.

The main battle results obtained by the Korean-Chinese People's Army in November are as follows (incomplete statistics):

\t1. Annihilated 30,811 enemy troops, including 9,728 US troops, 880 British and other accomplice troops, and 20,203 Li puppet troops.
\t2. Main captures: one anti-aircraft gun, one mortar, four recoilless guns, three 60mm guns, seven rocket launchers, three flamethrowers, fifty-five heavy machine guns, one hundred and sixty-nine light machine guns, one thousand and eighty-four automatic rifles, carbines, and submachine guns, thirty-six rifles and pistols, four signal guns, and forty-eight radio stations, walkie-talkies and other communication equipment.
\t3. Shot down or damaged 685 enemy aircraft, including 219 shot down and 466 damaged; destroyed or damaged 99 enemy tanks; destroyed or damaged 129 various vehicles; destroyed or damaged 81 various enemy guns.

    朝中部队十一月份歼敌三万余名
    击落击伤敌军飞机六百八十五架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】在十一月份中，朝鲜前线下了大雪，气候寒冷。朝中人民军队在冰天雪地中奋勇杀敌，彻底粉碎了范佛里特在金化以北上甘岭地区的攻势，并且继续展开战术反击，取得了重大的胜利。十一月中我军与敌作战共二百二十多次，歼灭敌军三万余名。
    金化以北上甘岭地区的战斗，是十一月份内全线战斗最激烈的地方。由于我军英勇的抗击，自十月十四日至十一月底为止，敌人的进攻已被我彻底粉碎了。上甘岭右边山岭——五九七点九高地上的战斗，至十一月五日黄昏时分即大体结束。当我军在十一月二日黎明前将这座山岭上的阵地全部夺回以后，敌人曾再次发动猛攻，企图夺占这个阵地。战斗的激烈不亚于敌人最初发动攻势的时候。是日白天，敌人派出飞机二百多架次，并炮击十二多万发，掩护其四个步兵营向我疯狂反扑。我军英勇还击，血战竟日，终将敌人击退。三日和五日两天，敌人继续进攻，结果还是失败。在这三天内，敌人伤亡三千多人便知难而退了。自六日到十三日，敌人又有过两次试探性的进攻，又都被我军击退。上甘岭左边山岭——五三七点七高地北山上的战斗，十一月上旬双方争夺的焦点是这座山岭的主峰。自十一日我军一举恢复这个山岭的全部阵地后，敌人曾增兵再攻，连续攻了四天，才勉强爬到一个小山腰上。自十五日以后，敌人的攻势逐渐衰退，这个山岭上的战斗形成逐阵地争夺的小战斗，战斗时断时续，敌人未能前进一步。
    在一个半月的上甘岭两侧山岭的争夺战中，敌军伤亡已达二万五千多人，消耗的军用物资则无法计算。现在，美国侵略军及其帮凶军的创伤未愈，美国将军们却又在叫嚣着明春的攻势。他们把一切“希望”都寄托在梦寐不忘的“两栖作战”上面。如果他们的兴趣确实很浓，过去的失败还不够惨痛，那末，朝中人民军队已经准备好了一切，不妨就请美国将军们再来尝试尝试。
    十一月中在前线其他地区，朝中人民部队继续进行反击战，攻占由班到连的敌军阵地二十七处，其中三处是敌军一个连的阵地。九日在东线高城以南大康里附近攻占伪军一个连的阵地，十日在西线铁原以西攻占石岘洞北山美军一个连的阵地。这两次的反击战都是在二十分钟内结束，守敌都被全歼。十八日在西线高浪浦里以北攻占两个高地，全歼英军一个连。此外，中线我军亦在上甘岭阵地两侧发起反击，有力地配合上甘岭的战斗，共计攻占九处敌军阵地，并且巩固地占领了铁原东北鹤堂里附近的三九一高地。
    十一月份前线我军游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军六千零三十六名，狙击手歼敌四千零八十三名。
    朝中人民部队在十一月份作战中所获主要战果如下（不完全统计）：
    一，歼灭敌军三万零八百一十一名，其中美军九千七百二十八名，英国等帮凶军八百八十名，李伪军二万零二百零三名。
    二，主要缴获：机关炮一门，迫击炮一门，无后座力炮四门，六零炮三门，火箭筒七具，火焰喷射器三具，重机枪五十五挺，轻机枪一百六十九挺，自动步枪、卡宾枪、冲锋枪一千零八十四支，步枪、短枪三十六支，信号枪四支，电台、步行机等通讯器材四十八件。
    三，击落击伤敌军飞机六百八十五架，其中击落二百一十九架，击伤四百六十六架；击毁击伤敌军坦克九十九辆；击毁击伤各种汽车一百二十九辆；击毁击伤敌军各种炮八十一门。
