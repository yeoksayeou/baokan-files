The Glorious Achievements of the Vietnam People's Army in Six Years of Resistance

This year, December 19th, marks the sixth anniversary of Vietnam's nationwide resistance. On this day in 1946, the French colonialists tore up the agreements signed with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 6th and September 14th of the same year, and perfidiously launched a full-scale invasion of Vietnam. The army and people of Vietnam, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, united as one and launched a heroic resistance for national freedom and independence.

The Vietnam People's Army, established on December 22, 1944, during the struggle against Japanese fascism, resolutely resisted the frenzied attacks of the French colonial army and is now victoriously entering its seventh year of resistance. Facts have proven that the Vietnam People's Army is an invincible revolutionary military force that grows stronger with each battle.

In the border campaign of autumn and winter of 1947, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated 6,000 French troops; in the autumn and winter of 1950, it liberated the five provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Lao Cai, Thai Nguyen, and Hoa Binh, annihilating nearly 10,000 French troops. These important victories marked the transition of the Vietnamese people's war against the French colonialists and American interventionists from the initial strategic defensive phase to a phase of stalemate.

In November 1951, the French invading army concentrated its forces and invaded Hoa Binh, attempting to seize the initiative in the war. The People's Army once again defeated the invading French troops and liberated Hoa Binh city on February 23, 1952. In this campaign, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated 22,000 French troops in a relatively short period, demonstrating that the Vietnam People's Army has become increasingly powerful in battle.

During the rainy season after the Hoa Binh campaign, the Vietnam People's Army launched a rectification movement. The People's Army and guerrillas strengthened the struggle behind enemy lines. In an attempt to gain a stable rear, the French colonialists launched dozens of large and small "mopping-up" operations in the Red River Delta and in central and southern Vietnam during the summer months. The Vietnam People's Army used flexible tactics to strike at the French colonial army. From the liberation of Hoa Binh city to the beginning of June this year, the Vietnam People's Army and the people's armed forces annihilated more than 49,000 French troops. Although the French invaders inhumanly created no-man's-lands in the Red River Delta, the Vietnam People's Army liberated many places behind enemy lines and expanded the guerrilla base areas. Many French strongholds, surrounded by the Vietnamese people's armed forces, had to rely on airlifts for supplies. The Vietnam People's Army effectively attacked the French army in North Vietnam, attracting the majority of the French forces invading Vietnam, and also smoothly launched battles in Central and South Vietnam.

This autumn, the People's Army launched a fierce offensive against the French invading army in the Thai ethnic minority area in northwestern Vietnam. After removing the French stronghold of Nghia Lo in Yen Bai Province, the People's Army advanced all the way to the Black River and crossed the river, liberating the entire area of Son La Province and the vast area of Lai Chau Province, except for the isolated stronghold of Na San. The battle is still ongoing. In October and November, the People's Army annihilated nearly 5,000 French troops in this area. At the same time, the People's Army further strengthened guerrilla warfare in the Red River Delta, annihilating more than 5,000 French troops in just one month, up to November 23.

On November 18, Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, announced that the Vietnam People's Army had annihilated 250,000 French troops in its operations.

After six years of heroic struggle, the Vietnamese army and people have greatly expanded and consolidated the liberated areas, reduced the enemy-occupied areas, and forced the French colonial army supported by American interventionists to be trapped in a few strongholds and narrow areas in Hanoi, Hai Phong, Hue, and Saigon. Now, the entire army and people of Vietnam are responding with confidence and determination to the call of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, striving to thoroughly defeat the French colonialists and American interventionists, and win the independence and freedom of the motherland.

### 越南人民军抗战六年来的光辉战绩

    越南人民军抗战六年来的光辉战绩
    今年十二月十九日，是越南全国抗战的六周年纪念日。一九四六年这一天，法国殖民者撕毁了在同年三月六日与九月十四日和越南民主共和国签订的协定，背信弃义地全面进犯越南。越南的军队和人民，在胡志明主席领导下，团结一致，为民族自由和独立而展开了英勇的抗战。
    在反对日本法西斯的斗争中于一九四四年十二月二十二日建立的越南人民军，坚决地抵抗了法国殖民军的疯狂进攻，现在正在胜利地踏入抗战的第七年。事实证明：越南人民军是一支愈战愈强的不可战胜的革命军事力量。
    越南人民军在一九四七年秋冬的边界战役，歼灭了法军六千人；一九五○年秋冬，解放了高平、谅山、老开、太原与和平五省，歼灭了法军近万人。这些重要的胜利，标志着越南人民反对法国殖民者和美国干涉者的战争，已从抗战初期的战略防御阶段，转入了相持阶段。
    一九五一年十一月，法国侵略军集结兵力，窜犯和平，妄想夺取战争主动权。人民军再次打败了进犯的法国侵略军，于一九五二年二月二十三日解放了和平城。在这一战役中，越南人民军在一个比较短的时期，歼灭了法军二万二千人，这说明了越南人民军在战斗中已日益强大。
    在和平战役以后的雨季中，越南人民军展开了整训运动。人民军与游击队并加强敌后斗争。法国殖民者为了企图获得稳定的后方，于夏季几个月中在红河三角洲以及中越、南越各地发动了大小数十次的“扫荡”战，越南人民军以灵活的战术打击法国殖民军。从解放和平城以后到今年六月初为止，越南人民军和人民武装又歼灭了法军四万九千多人。法国侵略者虽然在红河三角洲惨无人道地制造无人区，但越南人民军在敌后解放了许多地方，扩大了游击根据地。许多法军的据点由于被越南人民武装包围，只得依靠空运接济。越南人民军在北越有力地打击法军，吸引住侵越法军的大部兵力，在中越和南越，也顺利地展开战斗。
    今年秋天，人民军在越南西北部泰族聚居地向法国侵略军展开了猛烈的进攻。在拔除了安沛省法军据点义路之后，人民军一直打到黑水江边，并渡江挺进，解放了除那岑一个孤立据点而外的山萝省全部地区和莱州省的广阔地区。战斗目前仍在进行中。在十月和十一月间，人民军在这一带歼灭了法军近五千人。同时，人民军在红河三角洲进一步加强了游击战，仅在截至十一月二十三日为止的一个月间就歼灭了法军五千多人。
    十一月十八日，越南人民军总司令武元甲宣布：越南人民军的作战已歼灭了法军二十五万人。
    经过六年的英勇奋斗，越南军民业已大大扩大和巩固了解放区，缩小了敌占区，使美国干涉者支持的法国殖民军被迫困守于河内、海防、顺化和西贡的几个据点和狭小地区中。现在，越南全国军民正满怀着信心与决心，热烈响应越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的号召，为彻底打败法国殖民者和美国干涉者，赢得祖国的独立与自由而奋斗。
