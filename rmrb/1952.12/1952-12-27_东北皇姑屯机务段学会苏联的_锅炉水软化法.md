    Huang Gutun Locomotive Depot in Northeast China Learns the Soviet "Boiler Water Softening Method"
    Editor: With the help of Soviet experts, our Huang Gutun Locomotive Depot in Northeast China has implemented the advanced Soviet experience – the boiler water softening method. Before implementing this method, there was a lot of scale in the boiler water, which greatly hindered heat transfer. This not only consumed excessive fuel, but also frequently caused accidents such as leakage and cracking, shortening the service life of the boiler.
    Since we implemented the boiler water softening method, over a year ago, we have improved the quality of locomotives. The average scale accumulation inside the boilers of many locomotives has been reduced from 0.35 cm to 0.1 cm. Before using this method last year, 743 large and small smoke tubes were replaced. After using this method this year, no large smoke tubes were replaced, and only 33 small smoke tubes were replaced. Furthermore, the locomotive inspection and maintenance downtime has been shortened by about 30%. In addition, 10% of locomotive fuel has been saved, greatly extending the boiler's lifespan.
    After implementing the boiler water softening method, we further studied and created "solid anti-rust agent" and "thin and long water discharge method" in our work, improving the soft water work. In the future, we will learn even better from Soviet experts and run the people's railway well. Zhang Chengzong

    东北皇姑屯机务段学会苏联的“锅炉水软化法”
    编辑同志：我们东北皇姑屯机务段在苏联专家帮助下，实行了苏联的先进经验——锅炉水软化法。在没有实行这个方法以前，锅炉的水锈很多，对于传热很有妨碍，不但过多地耗费燃料，而且经常造成漏泄、龟裂等事故，缩短锅炉的使用寿命。
    自从我们实行锅炉水软化法以后，经过一年多时间，提高了机车的质量，很多台机车锅炉内积存的水锈平均由零点三五公分，降至零点一公分。去年没有使用这个方法以前，更换大、小烟管七百四十三根，今年使用这个方法后，没有更换大烟管，仅仅更换小烟管三十三根，并且使得机车的洗检库停时间，缩短了百分之三十左右，此外，还节省百分之十的机车燃料，大大地延长了锅炉寿命。
    实行锅炉水软化法后，我们在工作中又进一步钻研，创造了“固体防锈剂”和“细长放水法”，改善了软水工作。今后我们要更好地向苏联专家学习，把人民铁路办好。张成忠
