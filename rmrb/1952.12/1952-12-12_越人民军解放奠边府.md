Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam Dispatch: The Vietnam People's Army has continued to achieve new victories on the northwestern front of Vietnam.

After successively capturing a series of French military strongholds in November, the Vietnam People's Army advanced to the rice-producing area of the Dien Bien Plateau, liberating Dien Bien Phu, about 100 kilometers southwest of Lai Chau. While pursuing the fleeing French troops, they captured Major Sicard, a French officer who commanded a battalion of puppet troops. As of December 4, more than 300 French aggressor troops had been captured or surrendered to the People's Army in this area. The People's Army also seized six machine guns, 52 submachine guns, 200 rifles, 100 boxes of ammunition, 10 radios, 10 tons of grain, and a large number of other military supplies in Dien Bien Phu.

Another unit of the People's Army annihilated more than a company of French troops in the Pac Sam Cape area between Lai Chau and Binh Lu on December 3 and 5. The remaining French troops fled in panic from Pac Sam Cape.

    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军在越南西北部前线继续获得了新的胜利。
    越南人民军于十一月间接连攻下了一连串的法军据点后，挺进到奠边高原盛产大米的地区，解放了距莱州西南约一百公里的奠边府，并在追击溃逃的法军时，活捉了一个统率一营伪军的法国军官席卡尔少校。截至十二月四日为止，在这一地区被人民军俘虏的和向人民军投降的法国侵略军计有三百多名。人民军并在奠边府缴获了机枪六挺、冲锋枪五十二支、步枪二百支、弹药一百箱、电台十部、粮食十吨以及大量其他军事供应品。
    另路人民军于十二月三日和五日在莱州和平芦之间的朴参岬地区，歼灭了法军一连以上。法军残部仓皇从朴参岬逃跑。
