To the Editor: The Tangshan Company of the China Coal Construction Equipment Company lacks the idea of relying on the masses of workers to run the enterprise well and is indifferent to the safety and welfare of workers. The workers have a lot of opinions about this.

The Northwest Mine coal yard of the company has no lighting equipment. When coal trucks come at night, the workers unload the trucks in the dark, so accidents often occur. Some workers have their heads broken, some have their hands smashed, and some workers fall into ditches more than two zhang deep after unloading the trucks because they cannot see the road. The most dangerous time was when worker Sun Shujian was digging the track eye under the truck after unloading, the train driver could not see anyone in the dark, started the engine and pulled the carriages away. Sun Shujian quickly lay on the sleepers to avoid being crushed to death by the train. The workers have repeatedly raised their opinions to the administrative leaders, asking them to install lighting equipment as soon as possible. The administrative leaders repeatedly emphasized objective difficulties and delayed solving the problem for a long time. Recently, the trade union has urged the administrative side again, but the manager said: "Just deal with it for a few more months, the yard will be moved elsewhere."

The company also has an unreasonable regulation: the company only issues labor protection equipment such as masks and goggles to workers after they have worked for three months. The trade union asked to change this regulation, but the administrative leaders sophistically said: This is stipulated in the labor insurance regulations. In fact, there is no such unreasonable regulation in the labor insurance regulations at all; however, the administrative side is unwilling to implement some of the regulations in the labor insurance regulations that protect the interests of workers. For example, a worker fell from the pry bar while carrying coal and rested for six days before recovering. The administrative side said that he "neither broke nor bled" and could not be considered an industrial injury, and refused to pay his salary according to industrial injury standards. The grassroots trade union labor protection committee went to negotiate, but the administrative side still ignored it; later, the labor protection department of the Municipal Porter Trade Union put forward its opinions, and the matter was reasonably resolved.

In addition, the administrative side does not seriously solve the workers' dormitories, canteens, drinking water, and even toilet problems. In the past, the workers of the Northwest Mine coal yard built two small mud houses themselves, and more than one hundred workers took turns sleeping in them; it also leaked when it rained. After several requests from the trade union, the administrative side built three mud houses (one of which was a kitchen), and the workers contributed more than one hundred workdays. Now that the houses have been built, the administrative side does not provide flooring, so people still cannot live in them. At present, more than fifty workers live in small shops. There are no workers' canteens in each coal yard. Workers eat in a broken shed, which leaks rain, is drafty, and is full of flying coal dust. The Northwest Mine coal yard has only one small tea pot for more than one hundred workers. The workers carry water and boil it themselves, and they have to prepare their own teacups. There are no toilets in the coal yard. The workers suggested that the administrative side build one, and the reply was: "You can solve it yourselves!" The workers responded: "We not only don't eat well and rest well, but we don't even have a place to shit."

What is particularly unreasonable is that the company's production is long-term, but it employs workers as temporary workers; every six months, the company and the trade union (representing the workers) approve the contract. This needs to be improved.

Although the company treats workers with this wrong attitude, the workers' enthusiasm for production is still very high. They have saved 320 tons of coal in the third quarter and are working hard to save 400 tons of coal in the fourth quarter. We believe that the company should immediately correct its past wrong attitude, earnestly pay attention to production safety and workers' welfare issues, and reasonably solve the issue of long-term workers and temporary workers so that the increase production and practice economy movement can achieve greater results.

### 中国煤建公司唐山市公司应该重视工人安全福利问题

    中国煤建公司唐山市公司应该重视工人安全福利问题
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司唐山市公司缺乏依靠工人群众搞好企业的思想，对工人安全福利漠不关心。工人们对此很有意见。
    该公司西北井煤场没有照明设备，夜里来煤车时，工人们摸着黑卸车，因此经常发生事故。有的工人碰破了头，有的工人砸坏了手，还有的工人卸完车因看不见道而摔到两丈多深的大沟里去。最危险的一次是：工人孙树俭卸完车后在车底下扒道眼，火车司机因天黑看不见人，开起机车、拉着车皮就走。孙树俭赶紧卧在道木上，才没被火车轧死。工人们多次向行政领导干部提出意见，要求赶快安装照明设备。行政领导干部一味强调客观困难，拖延很久不给解决。最近工会又督促行政方面，但经理说：“再对付几个月就行了，场子要往别处挪了。”
    该公司还有一个不合理的规定：工人要工作满三个月后，公司才发给口罩、风镜等劳动保护用具。工会要求改变这个规定，行政领导干部却强词夺理地说：这是劳动保险条例上规定的。其实，劳动保险条例上根本没有这种不合理的规定；而劳动保险条例上有些保护工人利益的规定，行政方面却不愿执行。如有一个工人在抬煤时从撬板上摔了下来，休养了六天才好。行政方面却说他“既未摔破，又没出血”，不能算是工伤，不肯按工伤发工资。基层工会劳保委员去交涉，行政方面还是不管；后来由市搬运工会劳保部提出意见，这件事才算得到合理解决了。
    此外，工人的宿舍、食堂、饮水甚至厕所问题，行政方面都不认真解决。西北井煤场过去工人自己盖了两间小泥房，一百多工人就轮着在里面睡；下雨天还漏。经工会数次要求，行政方面才给盖了三间泥房（其中有一间是厨房），工人出了一百多个工。现在房子盖好了，行政方面不给铺板，还是没法住人。目前就有五十多个工人住小店。各煤场都没工人食堂，工人在一个破席棚里吃饭，又漏雨、又透风，并且煤末飞扬。西北井煤场一百多工人只有一个小茶锅，工人自己挑水烧水，茶碗也要自己预备。煤场没有厕所，工人建议行政方面盖一个，答复是：“你们自己解决就行了！”工人们反应说：“我们不但吃不好、休息不好，连拉屎都没个地方。”
    尤其不合理的是，该公司生产是长期性的，但雇用工人却采取临时工方式；每到六个月，由公司和工会（代表工人）批合同。这是需要改进的。
    虽然该公司用这种错误的态度对待工人，但工人生产热情仍然很高。他们在第三季度已节约了三百二十吨煤，并且正为第四季度节约四百吨煤而努力。我们认为：该公司应该立刻改正过去的错误态度，切实注意生产安全和工人福利问题，合理解决长期工和临时工的问题，使增产节约运动得到更大的成绩。老周　子亮　小胡
