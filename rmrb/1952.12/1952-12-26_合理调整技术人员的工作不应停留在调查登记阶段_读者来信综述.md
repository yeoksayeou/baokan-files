    Reasonable Adjustment of the Work of Technical Personnel Should Not Remain at the Investigation and Registration Stage
    ——Reader Letters Overview

    Recently we have received some reader letters criticizing the slow phenomenon of some personnel departments that fail to adjust promptly the work of specialized technical personnel who are not being used reasonably, and remain at the stage of investigation and registration for a long time. Wang Peiyu from the Guangye Spare Time School of the Dahua Textile Company in Guangyuan, Sichuan, wrote: “I registered as a technical personnel member in October of this year. But until now, I have not received any notice. I don't know whether I will be transferred to a new job or if I have to wait for another period of time. I feel uneasy.” Zhang Shugai from the Zhejiang Branch of the China Medical Company wrote: “There are many specialized technical talents in Hangzhou who are not being used reasonably. Although the personnel department has started to handle it, so far it has only done some investigation and registration work, and has not taken the initiative to make unified adjustments in a planned way.” Li Yu from the No. 1 Middle School in Nanchang, Jiangxi, wrote: “The Personnel Department of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government requested my materials through the Personnel Section of the Provincial Department of Culture and Education in early August; but there was no further news by October. I went to the Personnel Department several times to urge them. The result of the conversation was: the Personnel Department agreed to transfer me, but the Department of Culture and Education had to agree as well. It also depends on where I'll be transferred. Three weeks later, I wrote to the Personnel Department again, asking them to actively find a solution. The reply said: ‘We don’t understand your specific situation, please register with your unit first.’ Obviously, they did not know that my problem had been held up in the Personnel Department for three months. I had to write again to explain, but so far, there has been no further news.”

    Readers unanimously pointed out: In the process of our country moving towards industrialization, the difficulty of the task being great and the strength being small, especially the lack of technical cadres, is a very serious and urgent problem to be solved in many production departments, especially in the basic construction departments. Therefore, failure to promptly transfer specialized technical personnel to the most needed work positions is an unfavorable act for the country's economic construction. It is suggested that the personnel departments quickly change the slow pace of work that has been stagnating in the investigation and registration stage for a long time, and quickly transfer technical personnel to the places where national construction needs them most.

### 合理调整技术人员的工作不应停留在调查登记阶段——读者来信综述

    合理调整技术人员的工作不应停留在调查登记阶段
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们收到一些读者来信，对有些人事部门不及时调整未被合理使用的专门技术人员，长期地停留在调查、登记阶段的迟缓现象提出批评。四川广元大华纺织公司广厂业余学校汪培萸来信说：“今年十月，我就办理了技术人员登记。但到现在，还没有得到通知。是不是要调工作，还是要再等一个时期，都不得而知。我感到不安。”中国医药公司浙江分公司张淑改来信说：“杭州市有许多专门技术人材未被合理使用。人事部门虽曾着手处理，但至今还只是作了一些调查登记工作，没有主动地、有计划地作统一调整。”江西南昌第一中学李毓来信说：“江西省人民政府人事厅在八月初旬，通过省文教厅人事科要了我的材料；但到十月还没有下文。我到人事厅去催过几次，谈话的结果是：人事厅同意调，可是还得文教厅同意。调到什么地方工作，也还要考虑。三个礼拜以后，我又写信给人事厅，请他们积极想办法。回信却说：‘对你的具体情况不了解，请先行向本单位登记。’显然，他并不知道我的问题已在人事厅压了三个月。我只好又去信说明，但到现在为止，还没有下文。”
    读者一致指出：在我们国家走向工业化的进程中，任务大力量小的困难，特别是技术干部缺乏的困难，在许多生产部门、尤其是基本建设部门是十分严重而急待解决的问题。因此，不及时把专门技术人材调到最需要的工作岗位上去，是对国家经济建设不利的行为。建议人事部门迅速改变这种长时期停顿在调查登记阶段的工作迟缓现状，把技术人员迅速输送到国家建设最必需的地方去。
