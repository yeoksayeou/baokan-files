    The Ideological Armament of Writers

    The "Literary Gazette" published an editorial on November 29th entitled "The Ideological Armament of Writers." The article points out the importance of writers mastering Marxist-Leninist theory. The following is an abstract: Gorky said that our Soviet literature "...lives in the situation of fighting the old world, living in the tense construction of the new world." This is why writers must persistently improve their ideological cultivation, enrich their knowledge, and creatively master Marxism-Leninism. If writers master the science of Marxism-Leninism, they will be able to see the real situation more profoundly and clearly, and see the distant future. The entire experience of the development of Soviet literature—from Gorky to us today—proves unequivocally that success always accompanies those writers who can seriously discern the real situation and deeply understand the objective laws of social development. A. Tolstoy wrote: "Marxism, skillfully mastered, is 'living water.'" He said beautifully and convincingly that mastering Marxism enabled him to gain "purpose and method in reading the book of life" and to truly understand history.

    A. Tolstoy said: "I had long wanted to write the book 'Peter the Great'...I saw all the stains on him—but Peter remains a mystery in the historical mist." Giving a true artistic representation of the era of Peter presented a great difficulty for this literary figure. The creation of "Peter the Great," one of the best historical novels, is the greatest victory of Soviet literature; the profound study of Marxism-Leninism gave A. Tolstoy a guide for creating the image of "Peter the Great," enabling him to correctly interpret the Petrine era of Russian history; Marxist theory enriched A. Tolstoy's talent, enabling him to develop it to the fullest extent.

    The great revolutionary poet Mayakovsky tirelessly studied from the Party, from Lenin, and from Stalin, sharpening his poetic weapon.

    Nikolai Ostrovsky wrote: "When I was an ignorant youth, could I have written what I am writing now after persistent study, when I am armed with the theory of revolutionary struggle and able to summarize my experiences in artistic images? No, I could not. Because I saw, observed, and felt too little. One should study, one should acquire deep knowledge of life, one should know the best works in world culture in order to broaden one's horizons, in order to use Marxist-Leninist theory to explain one's experiences. Only then can one bravely take up the pen and summarize one's observations, and only then can one produce valuable works."

    To elucidate one's experiences with Marxist-Leninist theory—how meaningful this is for writers!

    The historic resolutions of the 19th Party Congress and the publication of Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" are of great significance for the development of our literature and for improving the ideological and political cultivation of writers.

    The interests of great Soviet literature require writers to constantly study and master rich knowledge. The Soviet Writers' Union, the Writers' Unions of the various fraternal republics, the Writers' Organizations of the various states, and all writers' groups should pay serious attention to this matter, so that every writer studies, improves his general and political knowledge, and is good at creatively using the invincible weapon of Marxist-Leninist theory. Those who care about the writers' studies should be first of all the writers' Party organizations. Their responsibility is to resolutely strengthen ideological work.

    Raising the Cultural and Technical Level of Workers

    The "People's Daily" published an editorial on December 9th entitled "Raising the Cultural and Technical Level of Workers." The article points out that raising the cultural and technical level of workers plays an important role in improving industry. The following is an abstract: Raising the cultural and technical level of the working people is of great significance for further improving all sectors of the national economy, for more broadly launching the socialist competition to complete and over fulfill the state plan and improve product quality.

    Comrade Stalin wrote in his classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "Why has socialist competition become mass competition? Because among the workers there are batches and batches of comrades who have not only mastered basic technical knowledge, but have gone further, standing at the same level as technicians, and beginning to correct the shortcomings of technicians and engineers, breaking outdated current quotas, adopting new and more modern quotas, and so on. What would happen if not a few workers, but the majority of workers, raised their cultural and technical level to the level of engineering and technical personnel? Then our industry would rise to a height unattainable by the industry of other countries."

    The continuous growth of technical equipment in all sectors of the national economy, the participation of new workers in existing enterprises and newly opened enterprises, all require further expansion and improvement of the production and technical education of the working people. The task is to enable every worker to fully understand the production technology and工艺学 of his factory, to master the best methods of production operation, and to strive to achieve increased labor productivity and product quality. In particular, the technical study of workers in all learning organizations should be directed to this aspect.

    The technical study of workers' production has a wide scale in our enterprises, but there are serious shortcomings in the organization of study. The situation in some enterprises of the Ministry of Iron and Steel Metallurgy is very significant in this regard. Last year, 149,000 people here studied in training classes to train new workers and improve their skills. However, most of these were workers in auxiliary industries. Workers in the main workshops of the decisive production sectors did not receive sufficient technical training. The lectures in these training classes are often entrusted to unskilled staff.

    Serious shortcomings in technical training also exist in many other sectors of the national economy. In the various technical groups and schools of the Orzhonikidze Iron Works, a quarter of the workers are studying, but the quality of the study and its practical results are always unsatisfactory. This mainly shows that the Ministry of Nonferrous Metal Metallurgy has not paid due attention to the organization of workers' technical training. As a result, the factory staff had to compile technical teaching outlines and even textbooks on the spot.

    Improving the cultural and technical level of workers should be the constant concern of the ministries and all economic leaders.

    Party organizations and trade unions should do more work to improve the cultural and technical level of workers. The experience of the Party Committee of the Ural Machinery Manufacturing Factory is worth popularizing. It systematically supervises the progress of cadre training in the factory and is very concerned about technical training. At the meeting of the Party Committee, the Communist Party members—the leaders of the main workshops and departments—regularly report on the technical learning situation. In this year alone, more than 7,000 workers in the factory have improved their skills. During the same period, nearly 4,000 people are studying in many Stakhanov schools.

    The duty of Party organizations and trade unions is to constantly study the issue of workers' technical training, support all innovators in the economic sector, promote their creativity, and arouse the mass movement of inventors and rationalization proposers to strive for further improvement of technology and development of production, and strive for comprehensive mechanization of labor.

    Our scientific research institutions should help more and more actively to improve the cultural and technical level of the working people. Science and technology publicity homes, cultural palaces, workers' clubs, and libraries should also play an important role in this regard. Speeches and consultations on technical issues, exhibitions of new labor methods and improvements in production processes, visits to advanced enterprises, discussions with innovators in various economic sectors, and promotion of their works—all these and other forms of production technology propaganda should be subordinated to improving the cultural and technical level of the working people. It is most important that the staff of newspapers, radio, and film study the issue of production technology propaganda more and better.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    作家的思想武装
    “文学报”十一月二十九日发表以“作家的思想武装”为题的社论。该文指出作家掌握马克思—列宁主义理论的重要性。摘要如下：高尔基说过，我们的苏维埃文学“……生活在与旧世界战斗的情况中，生活在紧张地建设新世界中”。这就是为什么必须使作家坚持地提高自己的思想修养，充实知识，创造性地掌握马克思—列宁主义的道理。作家掌握了马克思—列宁主义的科学，就能更深刻地更明确地看到真实的情况，看到遥远的将来。苏维埃文学发展的全部经验——从高尔基到我们今天——确凿地证明，成功总是陪伴着那些能够认真地洞察真实情况和深刻认识社会发展的客观法则的作家们。阿·托尔斯泰写道：“巧妙地掌握了的马克思主义，就是‘活的水’”。他十分美妙地令人完全信服地说过，掌握马克思主义，使他在“读生活之书的时候获得了目的性和方法”，使他真正认识了历史。
    阿·托尔斯泰说：“我早就想写‘彼得大帝’这部书……我看见了他身上的所有的污点，—但是，彼得依然是历史云雾中之谜。”对彼得时代给以真实的艺术的表现，使这位文学家感到了巨大的困难。最好的历史小说之一“彼得大帝”的创作，是苏维埃文学的最大胜利；对马克思—列宁主义的深刻研究，使阿·托尔斯泰有了创作“彼得大帝”形象的导线，使他能够正确地解释俄国历史的彼得时代；马克思主义的理论丰富了阿·托尔斯泰的才能，使他能够尽量发展。
    伟大的革命诗人马雅可夫斯基不倦地向党、向列宁和斯大林学习，磨快了自己的诗的武器。
    尼古拉·奥斯特洛夫斯基写道：“当我还是一个无知的青年时，我能够写出我现在在顽强的学习以后，当我用革命斗争的理论武装起来和能够在艺术形象中总结自己的经验时所写出来的东西吗？不，不能够。因为看的，观察的，感觉的都很少。应当学习，应当获得深刻的生活知识，应当知道世界文化中最好的作品，以便扩大自己的眼界，以便用马克思—列宁主义的理论来阐明自己的经验。只有那时才能够勇敢地执笔和总结自己的观察，才能产生有价值的作品。”
    以马克思—列宁主义的理论来阐明自己的经验—这对于作家来说是多么意味深长呢！
    党的第十九次代表大会的历史性的决议和斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的出版，对于我们文学的发展，对于作家的思想——政治修养的提高有着重大的意义。
    伟大的苏维埃文学的利益，是要求作家不断地学习，掌握丰富的知识。苏联作家协会、各兄弟共和国的作家协会、各州的作家组织、所有的作家团体，应当严肃地注意这件事，使每个作家学习，提高自己的一般的和政治的知识并善于创造性地使用马克思—列宁主义理论这个无往不胜的武器。关怀作家的学习的，首先应当是作家的党组织。它们的职责——就是坚决地加强思想工作。
    提高工人的文化—技术水平
    “真理报”十二月九日发表以“提高工人的文化—技术水平”为题的社论，该文指出提高工人文化—技术水平对于工业的提高起着重要的作用。摘要如下：提高劳动人民的文化—技术水平，对于进一步提高一切国民经济部门，对于更广泛地展开争取完成和超额完成国家计划和改善产品质量的社会主义竞赛，是有着重大的意义的。
    斯大林同志在自己的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中写道：“为什么社会主义竞赛具有了群众性呢？因为在工人中间有了整批整批的同志，他们不仅掌握了基本的技术知识，而且更前进了，与技术人员站在同一水平上，开始纠正技师和工程师的缺点，打破已经陈旧的现行定额，采用新的更加现代化的定额等等。假如不是少数工人，而是大多数工人都把自己的文化技术水平提高到了工程技术人员的水平，结果会怎么样呢？那我国的工业就会提高到其他各国工业所不能达到的高度。”
    一切国民经济部门技术装备的不断增长，新的工人参加现有企业和新开工的企业，都要求进一步扩大和改善劳动人民的生产—技术教育。任务在于使每个工人完全通晓自己工厂的生产技术和工艺学，掌握生产操作的最好的方法，努力获得劳动生产率和生产品质量的提高。特别是应当把一切学习组织的工人技术学习引向这一方面。
    工人的生产技术学习在我们的企业中具有广大的规模，但是，在学习的组织里是有严重缺点的。关于这一方面，钢铁冶金部的一些企业中的情况是很显著的。去年，这里有十四万九千人在培养新工人和提高他们的熟练程度的训练班里学习。但是，这大多是一些副业的工人。决定性的生产部门的主要车间的工人，所受到的技术训练是不够的。这些训练班的讲课时常委托给一些不熟练的工作人员。
    技术训练中的严重缺点在其他许多国民经济部门中也是有的。在奥尔忠尼启则铁工厂的各种技术小组和学校里，有四分之一的工人在学习，但是，学习的质量及其实际的结果总是使人不能满意。这主要说明有色金属冶金部对于工人技术训练组织没有予以应有的注意。其结果，工厂的工作人员不得不就地编制技术教学提纲，甚至编制教科书。
    工人的文化—技术水平的提高应当是各部和一切经济领导人的经常关怀的对象。
    党组织和职工会在提高工人的文化—技术水平方面应当多做些工作。乌拉尔机器制造工厂的党委会的经验是值得推广的，它有步骤地监督该厂培养干部的进程，非常关心技术训练。在党委会的会议上，按期地听取共产党员——主要的车间和各部门的领班——关于技术学习情况的汇报。仅在今年的一年中，在该厂内就有七千多工人提高了自己的熟练程度。同一时间内，在许多斯塔哈诺夫的学校里，近四千人在学习。
    党组织和职工会的职责，就是经常研究工人技术训练的问题，支持一切经济部门的革新者，发扬他们的创造性，唤起发明者和合理化建议者争取进一步改进技术和发展生产、争取劳动全面机械化的群众性运动。
    我们的科学—研究机关应当更多地和更积极地帮助提高劳动人民的文化—技术水平。科学—技术宣传之家、文化宫、工人俱乐部、图书馆在这一方面也应起重要的作用。关于技术问题的演说和谘询、新的劳动方法和生产过程的改进的展览、参观先进的企业、各经济部门革新者的座谈、推广他们的著作——所有这些和其他的生产技术宣传的形式，应当服从于提高劳动人民的文化技术水平。最重要的是使报纸、广播和电影的工作人员更多地和更好地研究生产技术宣传的问题。
