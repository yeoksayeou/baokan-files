The Chinese National Musicians Association held a concert today in Beijing to celebrate the 70th birthday of Zoltán Kodály, the renowned Hungarian musician and recipient of the highest Kossuth Prize, and to study and learn from Kodály's valuable experiences in promoting national musical heritage. The concert featured recordings of Kodály's representative works and famous pieces by other Hungarian composers.

Kodály is a great patriotic musician who spent nearly half a century of his life in an unyielding struggle against the Hungarian feudal forces and the atrocities of Horthy's fascism. Kodály's works reflect the Hungarian people's deep feelings and love for life and inspire them to fight for lofty goals. For decades, he and his friend Béla Bartók collected more than 20,000 folk songs, mastered their regularity, and reproduced and adapted many folk songs, which made a great contribution to the development of Hungarian national music. In 1951, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic awarded him the highest Kossuth Prize for the publication of the first volume of his Hungarian Folk Song Collection and his creation "Kálló Double Dance" (a chorus adapted from a folk song, depicting the narrative poem of the liberated Hungarian people). Kodály's works are also loved by people all over the world. One of his famous works, the chorus "Psalmus Hungaricus," has been translated into more than twenty languages.

In addition, the Central People's Broadcasting Station will also broadcast Kodály's works tonight from 8:45 PM to 9:30 PM.

    中华全国音乐工作者协会举行音乐会
    庆祝匈牙利著名音乐家柯达伊七十诞辰
    今天是匈牙利著名音乐家，最高级柯树特奖金获得者佐尔丹·柯达伊的七十寿诞。中华全国音乐工作者协会为了庆祝柯达伊的七十寿诞，研究与学习柯达伊在发扬民族音乐遗产方面的宝贵经验，特于今日在北京举行唱片音乐会，内容有柯达伊的代表作品及其他匈牙利作家的名曲等。
    柯达伊是一位伟大的爱国主义音乐家，他的一生几乎有半个世纪的时间是在反抗匈牙利封建势力和霍尔第法西斯主义暴行的不屈不挠的斗争里度过的。柯达伊的作品反映了匈牙利人民对生活的深切感情和热爱，并鼓舞人民去为崇高的目标进行斗争。几十年来他曾与他的朋友贝拉·巴尔多克一起收集了两万多首民歌，并掌握了它的规律性，将许多民歌加以复制和改编，这对匈牙利民族音乐的发展有着极大的贡献，一九五一年匈牙利人民共和国政府为了奖励他的匈牙利民歌集第一集的出版和他的创作“考拉双人舞”（合唱一首由民歌改编的，描写解放了的匈牙利人民的叙事诗）授予最高级柯树特奖金。柯达伊的作品也为全世界人民所爱好，他的著名作品之一——合唱“普沙姆斯·洪加利古斯”已被译成二十多种语言。
    又，中央人民广播电台亦定于今晚八点三刻至九点半播送柯达伊的作品。
