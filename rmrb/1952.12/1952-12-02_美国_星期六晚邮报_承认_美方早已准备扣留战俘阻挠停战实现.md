Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st - The U.S. government's deliberate creation of so-called "voluntary repatriation" on the POW issue to obstruct and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations has recently been revealed by the American "Saturday Evening Post."

According to a report in the "Saturday Evening Post" on November 1st, U.S. intelligence agencies had already been engaged in a series of illegal activities in U.S. POW camps prior to the start of the Korean armistice negotiations. The report stated that when the armistice negotiations began, "at least a dozen American and United Nations agencies were officially working among the prisoners under the supervision of the Eighth Army Logistics Command. Intelligence agencies frequently interrogated the prisoners, while psychological warfare and propaganda agencies were almost constantly conducting various investigations."

The result of these intelligence agency activities was a proposed plan to forcibly detain POWs. The "Saturday Evening Post" stated that approximately one week before the start of the Korean armistice negotiations in July 1951, the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Bureau in Washington sent a memorandum to the U.S. Army Chief of Staff. This memorandum suggested that before starting negotiations on the POW issue, "some affirmative decisions should be made regarding whether to support or oppose the forced repatriation of Korean prisoners."

The "Saturday Evening Post" said that the U.S. Army Chief of Staff sent this recommendation to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who in turn forwarded it to the National Security Council, whose members included the U.S. President and Secretary of State. The National Security Council then formulated a "policy that the United States must refuse to return to the Communists any prisoners who forcibly resist repatriation" based on this recommendation.

The countless bloody incidents that occurred in U.S. POW camps after the start of the armistice negotiations fully confirmed the "Saturday Evening Post" report. After formulating such a policy, the U.S. government adopted a series of shameless methods in its POW camps to create so-called "prisoners who forcibly resist repatriation." This conspiracy intensified with the start of discussions on the POW issue. According to reports from captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who were forcibly recruited as spies and airdropped behind our lines by the U.S., the U.S. had been transferring large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents from Taiwan to U.S. POW camps since last September to serve as "instructors." They subjected the captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel to barbaric persecutions such as forced tattooing and forced writing of blood letters, violating their will to return to their homeland and forcing them to "reject repatriation." Even the "International Committee of the Red Cross," an organization subservient to the U.S. government, had to acknowledge in its recent report to us that the captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel strongly protested the "pressure of some kind to return to Taiwan or North Korea" being applied to prisoners in various camps.

In the POW camps detaining captured Korean People's Army personnel, the same conspiracy of using bayonets to create "prisoners who refuse repatriation" was being carried out. The "International Committee of the Red Cross" recently acknowledged in its report that the U.S. had been systematically massacring prisoners since last August and prohibiting prisoners from celebrating their homeland's liberation day, attempting to suppress the prisoners' desire to return to their homeland through these shameless methods and create conditions for forcibly detaining them.

By the time the POW issue began to be discussed last December, the U.S. was simultaneously proposing the absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" at the negotiating table and intensifying its efforts to create "prisoners who refuse repatriation" in the POW camps. The "International Committee of the Red Cross" report acknowledged that the U.S. had already begun using bloody massacres to conduct forced "screenings" at least by December 22nd. Since then, the scale of U.S. atrocities in the POW camps has grown larger and larger, and the incidents of massacring prisoners are too numerous to count. All of this fully proves that the U.S. deliberately created obstacles on the POW issue to obstruct the realization of the Korean armistice.

Under the U.S.'s implementation of policies of obstruction and sabotage, it was only through our repeated efforts and maximum tolerance that the Korean armistice negotiations were able to continue and many issues were agreed upon. The "Saturday Evening Post" acknowledged that by February of this year, virtually "agreements had been worked out on every issue except the exchange of prisoners of war. But even on this issue, the Communists had made important concessions."

This is indeed the case. In the discussions on the POW issue, we made a series of important concessions within the scope permitted by the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, and we refuted the U.S.'s absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" beyond any possible defense. The "Saturday Evening Post" said that under our forceful and righteous rebuttal, even the U.S. negotiators had to admit that "there has never been a precedent for allowing prisoners of war to decide for themselves whether they want to be exchanged to go home." It was precisely because of our unremitting efforts and adherence to internationally recognized principles that both sides finally reached an agreement on the principle of repatriation, which was finally established in Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement, which is: "All prisoners of war held by both sides at the time this armistice agreement comes into effect shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible. The release and repatriation of such prisoners of war shall be carried out in accordance with the lists exchanged and corrected by both sides before the signing of this armistice agreement." The "Saturday Evening Post" admitted that this principle, which fully complies with the Geneva Convention, has been accepted by both sides.

Therefore, if the U.S. truly has the sincerity to seek a Korean armistice, then as long as the provisions of Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement are implemented, the POW issue can be quickly resolved and the Korean armistice can be realized immediately. However, the U.S. government, which fears peace, overturned this agreed principle and insisted on forcibly detaining POWs. The "Saturday Evening Post" said, "Washington's final decision was that the U.S. government has an obligation to oppose the forced repatriation of any one of the 170,000 prisoners." In other words, the U.S. government is determined to continue to use the unreasonable demand of "voluntary repatriation" to close the door to negotiations. In order to deceive world opinion, the U.S. government has rebranded the bankrupt "voluntary repatriation" as "non-forcible repatriation." And the U.S. negotiators, who have been refuted to the point of speechlessness, have no choice but to repeatedly request recesses to escape the condemnation of the world.

The matter is already very clear: the American aggressors, having suffered heavy losses in the war of aggression against Korea, have had to sit down to negotiate, but they have no sincerity at all in realizing an armistice in Korea. They are simply trying to use the armistice negotiations to buy time to regroup and come back. They are creating so-called "voluntary repatriation" to forcibly detain POWs, not only to gather cannon fodder to continue the war, but also to prepare conditions for disrupting the armistice negotiations and continuing the war. The facts are all there, and the "humanitarian" signboard raised by Acheson and his gang of lackeys at the United Nations General Assembly absolutely cannot conceal the U.S. government's conspiracy to use the POW issue to undermine the armistice negotiations.

### 美国“星期六晚邮报”承认  美方早已准备扣留战俘阻挠停战实现

    美国“星期六晚邮报”承认
    美方早已准备扣留战俘阻挠停战实现
    【新华社开城一日电】美国政府在战俘问题上蓄意制造所谓“自愿遣返”来阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判阴谋，这已经由美国的“星期六晚邮报”在最近透露出来了。
    据“星期六晚邮报”在十一月一日报道说，美国的特务机关在朝鲜停战谈判开始之前，就已经在美方战俘营中进行了一系列的非法活动。该报说，在停战谈判开始的时候，“至少有一打美国和联合国的机构正式在第八军后勤司令部的监督下在俘虏当中工作着。谍报机构经常去询问那些俘虏，心理作战和宣传机构则几乎不断地进行各种调查。”
    这些特务机关活动的结果，拟出了强迫扣留战俘的方案。“星期六晚邮报”说，在一九五一年七月朝鲜停战谈判开始前约一星期，华盛顿的美国陆军心理作战局送给美国陆军参谋长一件备忘录，这件备忘录建议，在开始谈判战俘问题之前，“对赞成或反对强迫遣返朝鲜俘虏一事应作出某些肯定的决定来”。
    “星期六晚邮报”说，美国陆军参谋长把这个建议送到参谋长联席会议，后者又把它转送到国家安全委员会去，这个委员会的委员包括美国总统和国务卿在内。国家安全委员会就根据这个建议制订出了“美国必须拒绝交回给共产党任何以强力抗拒遣返的俘虏的政策”。
    停战谈判开始以后在美方战俘营中发生的无数血腥事件，完全证实了“星期六晚邮报”的报道。美国政府在制订了这样一个政策以后，就在它的战俘营中采取一系列无耻的办法，制造所谓“强力抗拒遣返的俘虏”。这个阴谋活动随着战俘问题讨论开始而加紧进行。根据被美方强迫充当特务空降到我方后方的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的报告，美方从去年九月起就陆续从台湾调了大批蒋匪特务到美方战俘营中去充当“教官”。他们对中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行了强迫刺字，强迫写血书等等野蛮迫害，强奸他们要求遣返祖国的意志，逼迫他们“拒绝遣返”。连美国政府的御用组织“红十字国际委员会”在它最近给我方的报告书中都不能不承认，中国人民志愿军被俘人员强烈抗议在各营场战俘中实施的“回台湾还是回北朝鲜的某种压力”。
    在拘留朝鲜人民军被俘人员的战俘营中，同样进行着这种用刺刀制造“拒绝遣返的战俘”的阴谋。“红十字国际委员会”最近的报告书中承认，从去年八月起美方就有计划地屠杀战俘，禁止战俘庆祝祖国的解放日，企图用这种无耻的方法来压制战俘的遣返祖国的愿望，为强迫扣留他们制造条件。
    到去年十二月战俘问题开始讨论时，美方一方面在谈判桌上提出“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，一方面加紧在战俘营中制造“拒绝遣返”的战俘。“红十字国际委员会”的报告书承认，美方至少在十二月二十二日就已经开始用血腥屠杀来进行强迫“甄别”。从那时以来，美方在战俘营中的暴行的规模越来越大，屠杀战俘的事件多到无法计数。这一切都充分证明美方蓄意在战俘问题上制造障碍，以阻挠朝鲜停战的实现。
    在美方实行阻挠和破坏政策的情况下，只是由于我方的一再努力和最大限度的忍让，才使朝鲜停战谈判得以继续进行，并使许多问题获得了协议。“星期六晚邮报”承认，到了今年二月，实际上“在每一个问题上都已经设法达成了协议，仅仅是交换战俘这一个问题除外。但是即使在这个问题上，共产党也作了重要的让步”。
    事实也是如此。在战俘问题的讨论中，我方在一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约容许的范围内作了一系列重要的让步，并且将美方的“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则驳斥得体无完肤。“星期六晚邮报”说，在我方词正义严的驳斥下，连美方谈判代表也不得不承认，“从来没有过容许战俘自己决定是否愿意交换回家的先例”。正是由于我方的不懈努力和坚持国际公认的原则，双方终于在遣俘原则上获得了协议，这一原则最后在停战协定草案第五十一款中确定了下来，这就是：“本停战协定生效时各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。此项战俘的释放与遣返须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之。”“星期六晚邮报”承认，这个完全符合日内瓦公约的原则是双方都已经接受了的。
    因此，如果美方真正具有谋求朝鲜停战的诚意，那末只要执行停战协定草案第五十一款的规定，战俘问题就可以迅速解决，朝鲜停战就可以立即实现。但是害怕和平的美国政府却推翻了这个协议的原则，坚持强迫扣留战俘。“星期六晚邮报”说，“华盛顿最后的决定是：美国政府有义务去反对强迫遣返十七万名俘虏中的任何一人。”换句话说，美国政府决心仍然用“自愿遣返”的无理要求来关闭谈判之门。为了欺骗世界舆论，美国政府将已经破产的“自愿遣返”改头换面，美其名曰“不强迫遣返”。而已经被驳斥得无话可说的美方谈判代表，就只好用一再要求休会的办法，来逃避全世界的谴责。
    事情已经非常清楚，美国侵略者因为在侵略朝鲜的战争中碰得头破血流，不得不坐下来进行谈判，但是他们根本没有在朝鲜实现停战的诚意。他们只是企图利用停战谈判取得喘息时间，以便卷土重来。他们制造所谓“自愿遣返”来强迫扣留战俘，不仅是为了给继续进行战争搜罗炮灰，而且是为了给破坏停战谈判、继续进行战争准备条件。事实俱在，艾奇逊和他的一帮仆从们在联合国大会上抬出来的“人道主义”招牌，绝对掩饰不了美国政府利用战俘问题破坏停战谈判的阴谋。
