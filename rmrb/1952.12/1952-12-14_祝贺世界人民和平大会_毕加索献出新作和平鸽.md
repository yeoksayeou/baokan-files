    Congratulating the World People's Peace Congress
    Picasso Donates New Work "Dove of Peace"
    [Our Newspaper] To celebrate the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna, the famous French painter Picasso has donated another new work - a dove of peace. It gives us a new symbol, indicating that the struggle of people all over the world for peace has reached a higher stage. This is the third dove of peace painted by Picasso. The first was in April 1949, when the First World Peace Congress was held, he painted a tranquil dove, expressing the simple and dignified will of peace-loving people. The second was in September 1950, when he painted another dove dedicated to the Second World Peace Congress, which is the dove of peace that has been flying around the world in recent years. It is no longer quietly staying there, but spreading its wings and flying. Now, when the World People's Peace Congress is held, Picasso has donated the third dove of peace. It still maintains a style that makes the hearts of all peace-loving people feel extremely kind, but now the dove has its wings spread even wider and its feathers are fuller. It is flying to a higher place. The whole image of this dove makes us very clearly feel that it is younger and its vitality is infinitely abundant. It powerfully indicates that: on the basis of the continuous progress and victory of the world peace movement, through this World People's Peace Congress, the world people's movement to strive for and defend peace will develop to a higher stage and achieve new and great victories. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, this dove of peace will surely fly more bravely and higher and higher everywhere in the future.

    祝贺世界人民和平大会
    毕加索献出新作和平鸽
    【本报讯】为祝贺在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，法国名画家毕加索又献出了一幅新的作品——一只和平鸽。它给了我们一个新的象征，表示出全世界人民争取和平的斗争达到了一个更高的阶段。这是毕加索所画的第三幅和平鸽。第一幅是在一九四九年四月，当第一届拥护世界和平大会召开的时候，他画了一只恬静的鸽子，表示出爱好和平人民的纯朴的尊严的意志。第二幅是在一九五○年九月，他又画了一只鸽子献给第二届世界保卫和平大会，这就是近年来飞翔在世界各地的和平鸽，它已经不是恬静地停在那里，而是展翅飞翔的了。现在，当世界人民和平大会召开的时候，毕加索又献出了第三幅和平鸽。它仍然保持着使一切爱好和平人民的心灵感到极为亲切的一种风格，但是现在的这只鸽子，翅膀展开得更大了，羽毛更丰满了，它正向着更高的地方飞去。这只鸽子的整个形象，使我们非常明显地感觉到它更加年青，生命力无限充沛。它有力地表示着：在世界和平运动不断进展和已得胜利的基础上，经过这次世界人民和平大会，世界人民争取与保卫和平的运动将向更高的阶段发展，取得新的伟大胜利。这只和平鸽今后必然要在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，更勇敢地、更高更高地到处飞翔起来。
