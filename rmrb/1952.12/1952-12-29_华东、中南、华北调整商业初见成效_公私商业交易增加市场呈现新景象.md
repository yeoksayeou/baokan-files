Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The measures taken in East China, Central South, and North China to adjust commerce are bringing new scenes to the markets in various regions, and the volume of public-private commercial transactions is gradually increasing. According to statistics from six major cities—Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, and Nanning—the wholesale transaction volume of flour, rice, and polished rice in early December increased by 16.4 to 29.8 percent compared to late November. In Shanghai, the total turnover of 191 private shops in 29 industries in early December increased by 13.6 percent compared to early November. In Tianjin, the average daily turnover of 90 private department stores has increased by 9.14 percent compared to before the adjustment. Since the adjustment, state-owned trading companies in various regions have reduced their retail business and gradually expanded their wholesale business, thus further consolidating the leading position of the state-owned economy in the market. Comparing the business of Shanghai's state-owned department store in the two weeks before and after the adjustment, the retail sales decreased by 3.44 percent, while the wholesale sales increased by 14.88 percent. Therefore, the company's total turnover not only did not decrease, but increased by 10.69 percent compared to before the adjustment. The average turnover of Wuhan's Department Store Wholesale Station increased by about 60 percent compared to before the adjustment. In addition to adjusting the retail prices of commodities in the same proportion as state-owned companies, cooperatives also appropriately reduced some stores with little connection to members before the end of November, while strictly enforcing transactions based on member cards. On December 18, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau held a symposium on the division of public-private commercial business scope, where several specific decisions were made regarding the business scope of public-private commerce.

This year's lunar leap month has extended the most prosperous season of the year from New Year's Day to the Spring Festival, and experienced merchants regard the next two months as the best time for business. Currently, five industries in Wuhan—native produce, department stores, silk cloth, grain, and traditional Chinese medicine—under the leadership of the People's Government, have formed groups that, carrying goods and cash, departed in early December for more than sixty small and medium-sized towns and villages in Hubei, Hebei, and Guangxi to purchase and sell goods. They also encountered good business in the countryside. Private merchants in the department store and porcelain industries in Yichang City, Hubei Province, have formulated business plans, aiming to exceed the sales volume of November and December last year by 20 to 30 percent within the year. As the New Year is approaching, Wuhan's grocery, seafood, and other industries have purchased sugar, daylily, and red dates from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Henan, and have begun to supply the market; the market already has the atmosphere of the upcoming New Year festival. Since the adjustment of commerce, some consumers initially mistakenly believed that it would increase their burden, but according to a survey in Wuhan: the city's average price level in October this year decreased by 8 to 10 percent compared to the end of last year. The adjusted retail prices of commodities are still lower than the retail prices at the end of last year.

In order to implement the work of adjusting commerce to the primary markets, working groups from Hubei and Henan provinces, under the leadership of the main responsible comrades of the respective provincial people's governments, departed for various special districts before December 15 to inspect the adjustment of commerce and assist local people's governments in leading the exchange of materials in the primary markets. In Henan Province, market management committees have been established in most of the larger market towns in the Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Shangqiu, and Luoyang special districts. The Xuchang and Shangqiu administrative offices have also organized working groups to go deep into key market towns to create experience in rectifying and managing primary markets.

    华东、中南、华北调整商业初见成效
    公私商业交易增加市场呈现新景象
    【新华社二十七日讯】华东、中南、华北调整商业的措施，给各地市场带来了新的景象，公私商业的交易量正逐渐增加。据武汉、广州、长沙、南昌、郑州、南宁六大城市的统计，十二月上旬面粉、稻谷、大米的批发交易量比十一月下旬增加百分之十六点四到二十九点八；十二月上旬上海市二十九个行业一百九十一家私营商店的总营业额比十一月上旬增加百分之十三点六；天津市私营百货业九十户，现平均每日营业额比调整前增加了百分之九点一四。各地国营贸易公司自调整后，零售业务缩小，批发业务渐见扩大，国营经济在市场上的领导地位因而更加巩固。上海市国营百货公司调整前两周和调整后两周营业比较，零售额减少百分之三点四四，批发额增加了百分之十四点八八，因此该公司总的营业总额不仅没有减少，反而比调整前增加了百分之十点六九。武汉市百货批发站营业额平均要比调整前增加十分之六左右。合作社除了跟国营公司同样比例调整商品零售价格外，在十一月底前并适当地减少了一些与社员关系不大的门市部，同时严格执行凭社员证交易。十二月十八日上海市人民政府工商局曾召开关于划分公私商业经营范围座谈会，会上作出若干关于公私商业经营范围的具体决定。
    今年农历闰月，延长了一年当中从新年到春节这一段市场最繁荣的季节，有经验的商人们把今后两个月看成经营的最好时机。现武汉市土产、百货、绸布、粮食、中药等五个行业在人民政府领导下，已组成小组，携带货物和现款于十二月初分赴湖北、河北、广西的中小城镇、农村六十多处购销，他们在农村也同样遇到了好买卖。湖北省宜昌市的百货、磁铁两业的私商已制订了营业计划，他们在年内要争取超过去年十一、十二月的营业额百分之二十到三十。新年已快到了，武汉市杂货、海味等业已从广东、广西、湖南、河南采购了食糖、黄花菜、红枣，开始应市；市场上已有了年节就要到来的气象。自调整商业以后，有些消费者最初误认为会增加了自己的负担，但据武汉市调查：今年十月份该市的物价平均比去年年底还下降了百分之八到百分之十。调整后的商品零售价格仍低于去年年底的零售价。
    为了把调整商业工作贯彻到初级市场，湖北、河南两省的工作团在各该省人民政府主要负责同志的领导下，已于十二月十五日前，先后分赴各专区，检查各地关于调整商业的情况，及协助当地人民政府领导初级市场的物资交流工作。河南省的郑州、许昌、商邱、洛阳等专区的较大集镇，大部分已建立了市场管理委员会。许昌、商邱专署并组织了工作组深入重点集镇，创造整顿管理初级市场的经验。
