Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: New York - The case in which the U.S. New York Federal Court sentenced Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to death on fabricated "espionage" charges will proceed, as the U.S. Supreme Court recently disregarded the protests of progressive people in the U.S. and around the world and decided to uphold the original verdict. Therefore, the Rosenbergs will be electrocuted sometime during the week beginning January 12, 1953. This unjust case against the Rosenbergs was orchestrated by the U.S. ruling clique to incite war and anti-Soviet hysteria.

The Rosenbergs were arrested in 1950, shortly after the U.S. launched its war of aggression in Korea. The sequence of events was as follows: The U.S. secret service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claimed to have cracked a spy case involving the secret leaking of atomic bomb information to the Soviet Union during World War II. The lead in the case was Ethel Rosenberg's brother, David Greenglass, who allegedly confessed that in 1944 he had passed atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union through Rosenberg. On March 6, 1951, the New York Federal Court began hearing the case. Eight months before the trial even began, the propaganda machine of U.S. big capital was already loudly proclaiming the Rosenbergs' guilt. During the perfunctory trial, the New York Federal Court failed to produce any witnesses or physical evidence proving the Rosenbergs' connection to the so-called "espionage" case, relying solely on Greenglass's oral testimony as "evidence." Even "Time Magazine" admitted that this testimony was "scientifically meaningless," but the New York Federal Court, based on this testimony, sentenced the Rosenbergs to death and another victim in the case, Sobell, to thirty years in prison. Greenglass, who confessed to being a spy, was only sentenced to fifteen years, and his wife, Rose, who also confessed to being a spy, was never even put on trial.

From the moment of their arrest, the Rosenbergs and Sobell maintained their innocence. They repeatedly requested retrials from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, but the U.S. judicial authorities stubbornly upheld the original verdict.

This framing of the Rosenbergs by the U.S. judicial authorities has aroused the anger of honest people in the U.S. and around the world. William Patterson, Chairman of the Civil Rights Congress, wrote in an appeal to various countries: "Never in the history of our country has a government committed such a vile crime. The entire case has proceeded in an atmosphere of blind hatred. And this verdict lacks even a semblance of legality..." Prominent U.S. peace activists and public leaders, including Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, Dr. Weltfish, and Dr. Kronbach, initiated the formation of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, demanding that Truman overturn the sentences against the Rosenbergs and Sobell. The Women's International Democratic Federation and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have also protested to Truman, demanding the restoration of freedom to the Rosenbergs and Sobell. The Women's International Democratic Federation, in its communication to its members, pointed out that the Rosenbergs are victims of the U.S. "Cold War" conspiracy and are being murdered for advocating peace.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Fourteen people's organizations, including the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, jointly issued a statement on the 27th, protesting the U.S. government's savage act of fabricating charges and sentencing American progressives Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to death. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The American democratic progressives, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, have been sentenced to death by the U.S. government and are scheduled to be executed on January 12, 1953. They were convicted of a trumped-up charge, the so-called "conspiracy to supply the Soviet Union with materials on the atomic bomb," thus violating the "U.S. Espionage Act."

The Chinese people are extremely shocked and angered by this shameful verdict deliberately fabricated by the U.S. government to persecute democratic progressives, and we resolutely oppose and protest this barbaric act that disregards justice and tramples on human rights!

The process and facts of the Rosenberg trial prove that the U.S. government manufactured this unjust case with an ulterior political motive. The Rosenbergs have not committed any crime; they are simply ordinary, good American people. The prosecuting agency representing the U.S. government did not present any solid evidence (the witnesses were just a few thugs and hired professional spies bought by the U.S. secret service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation). The only "evidence" is that the Rosenbergs have progressive ideas. This "evidence" is so absurd that even the U.S. government's investigating agency did not dare to invite U.S. scientists to testify.

It is clear that the Rosenberg case is a product of the U.S. government's war policy. The U.S. government fabricated this unjust case in an attempt to use it as a pretext to slander the Soviet Union, to conduct anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda to incite war, and to conspire to suppress the growing peace movement in the U.S. and persecute democratic and progressive forces. This proves that the American reactionaries, riding in a chariot and rushing toward the road of destruction, have completely torn off the mask of so-called "democracy" and "human rights" in their domestic policy, revealing a ferocious fascist and militarist face.

Supporting the Rosenbergs means defending the peace, democracy, and freedom of the American people and the people of the world. Therefore, we fully sympathize with the struggle of the American people to safeguard human rights and strive for the release of the Rosenbergs, support the appeal of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, and demand that the U.S. government immediately overturn the unjust and barbaric verdict against the Rosenbergs and immediately restore the Rosenbergs' freedom.

### 美国政府捏造罪名判处罗森堡夫妇死刑  我国各人民团体抗议美政府野蛮行为

    美国政府捏造罪名判处罗森堡夫妇死刑
    我国各人民团体抗议美政府野蛮行为
    【新华社二十九日讯】纽约消息：美国纽约联邦法院以诬加的“间谍”罪名将朱利叶斯·罗森堡夫妇判处死刑一案，由于最近美国最高法院不顾美国和世界进步人民的抗议，决定维持原判，罗森堡夫妇因此将在一九五三年一月十二日开始的星期中被电刑处死。罗森堡夫妇这一冤狱是美国统治集团为煽动战争和反苏歇斯底里而一手制造的。
    罗森堡夫妇是在一九五○年美国刚刚在朝鲜发动侵略战争后被捕的。事件的经过是：美国特务机关美国联邦调查局扬言破获了一个在二次大战时将原子弹秘密泄露给苏联的间谍案。案子的线索是罗森堡夫人的兄弟戴维·格林格拉斯，据说他曾自供在一九四四年曾经通过罗森堡将原子弹的秘密泄露给苏联。一九五一年三月六日，纽约联邦法院开始审讯这一案件。早在开审前八个月，美国大资本的宣传机器就大事鼓吹说罗森堡夫妇罪名确立。纽约联邦法院在草草了了的审讯中提不出任何人证、物证证明罗森堡夫妇和所谓“间谍”案的联系，而只有格林格拉斯的口头说明作为“见证”。这种见证，甚至连“时代杂志”都承认是“毫无科学意义的”，但纽约联邦法院却根据这个见证就判处了罗森堡夫妇死刑，并且判处该案另一个受害者苏贝尔三十年徒刑。至于自认是间谍的格林格拉斯倒只判了十五年徒刑，同样已自认为间谍的他的妻子萝丝甚至根本没有受审。
    罗森堡夫妇和苏贝尔从被捕之日起就一直坚持自己是无罪的。他们向美国巡回上诉法院和美国最高法院数度提出重审的要求，但美国司法当局却蛮横地坚持原判。
    美国司法当局这种陷害罗森堡夫妇的事件已经引起了美国国内和全世界正直的人们的愤怒。美国民权保障大会主席威廉·帕特逊在向各国发出的呼吁书中写道：“在我国历史上，从来没有一个政府的罪行是如此卑劣。整个案件就在一种盲目的仇恨中进行。而这个宣判更连表面的合法都没有。……”美国著名和平战士和公众领袖杜波依斯博士、威尔特费希博士、克龙巴赫博士等发起组织争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会，要求杜鲁门撤销对罗森堡和苏贝尔的判决。国际民主妇女联合会、中华全国总工会也曾向杜鲁门提出抗议，要求恢复罗森堡夫妇和苏贝尔的自由。国际民主妇女联合会在它通告会员的信中曾指出：罗森堡夫妇是美国“冷战”阴谋的牺牲品，他们受到这样的谋害是因为他们拥护和平。
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等十四个人民团体二十七日联合发表声明，抗议美国政府捏造罪名判处美国进步分子罗森堡夫妇以死刑的野蛮行为。声明全文如下：
    美国的民主进步分子罗森堡及其妻子伊斯尔被美国政府判处死刑，并要在一九五三年一月十二日执行。他们被判定一个莫须有的罪名，即所谓“阴谋供给苏联关于原子弹的材料”，因而违犯了“美国间谍法”。
    中国人民对于美国政府这种故意制造出来的迫害民主进步分子的可耻判决，感到极大的震惊和愤怒，并坚决反对和抗议这种蔑视正义和蹂躏人权的野蛮行为！
    审判罗森堡夫妇的过程和事实证明，美国政府是抱着一个不可告人的政治目的而制造出这个冤狱案件来的。罗森堡夫妇没有犯任何罪行，他们只是普通的善良的美国人民。代表美国政府起诉的检察机构，没有提出任何确凿的证据，（作证的人只是几个被美国特务机关联邦调查局收买的流氓和雇用的职业特务）。唯一的“罪证”就是：罗森堡夫妇有进步思想，这个“罪证”是如此的荒谬绝伦，甚至美国政府的检查机构都不敢邀请美国科学家出庭作证。
    由此可见，罗森堡案件是美国政府战争政策的产物。美国政府制造出这个冤狱案件，是企图以此作为藉口来达到它诬蔑苏联，进行煽动战争的反苏反共宣传，阴谋镇压美国日益增长的和平运动和迫害民主进步力量的可耻目的。这就证明，驾着战车向着灭亡道路狂奔的美国反动派，在其国内政策上完全撕下了所谓“民主”和“人权”的假面具，而露出了一副穷凶极恶的法西斯主义和军国主义的面目。
    支援罗森堡夫妇，就是保卫美国人民、同时也是全世界人民的和平、民主与自由，因此我们完全同情美国人民为保障人权、争取释放罗森堡夫妇而进行的斗争，支援美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会的呼吁，要求美国政府立即撤销对罗森堡夫妇的不公正的野蛮判决，并立即恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。
