The nationally renowned cotton production model worker, Qu Yaoli, and the mutual aid team he leads, overcame severe natural disasters this year and achieved bumper cotton harvests for all members. This year, the average cotton yield of the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team and the average cotton yield of Qu Zhuangtou village in Jie County, Shanxi Province, Qu Yaoli's hometown, both ranked first in the Yuncheng Special District.

This year, the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team planted 73.2 mu of cotton on both irrigated and dry land, actually harvesting 38,119 jin of seed cotton, with an average yield of 520 jin and 12 liang per mu, exceeding the local average yield by 56.35 percent. Thirteen mu of the team's land met the high-yield award standards for irrigated cotton set by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, including Qu Yaoli's nine mu of high-yield land, which averaged 834 jin of seed cotton per mu; six mu met the high-yield award standards for dry land cotton set by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. With the direct assistance of Qu Yaoli's advanced experience, farmers in Qu Zhuangtou village, Jie County, achieved an overall bumper harvest on all 960.078 mu of irrigated and dry land cotton, harvesting a total of 319,999 jin and 11 liang of seed cotton, averaging 333 jin per mu.

During the autumn evaluation and summary of this year's bumper harvest experience, the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team unanimously felt the greatness of the collective labor force that organization brings. Last year, the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team only had four households, but this year it developed to eight households, resulting in a more scientific labor organization and a more detailed division of labor. This spring, when sowing, the original plan was to complete it in four days, but as a result, it was all sown in two days. After the labor efficiency was improved, cotton field management became more adequate, and farming techniques were greatly improved. For example, the thinning work was developed from three seedling fixings last year to four seedling fixings this year; last year was small furrow light watering, this year it developed into ditching and thorough watering. New developments have also been made in close planting, late-stage pruning, and pest control. This year, between March and April, cotton seedlings suffered from damping-off disease, and severe seedling shortages occurred in the cotton fields. In order to save this disaster, the Qu Yaoli team persevered in transplanting seedlings to fill the gaps. When the cotton seedlings died, they were transplanted and replenished; when they died again, they were transplanted and replenished again, persisting for a whole month. Qu Yaoli transplanted more than 1,000 seedlings on seven mu of cotton field, and more than 800 seedlings survived. In July, cotton bollworms, looping caterpillars, and mirid bugs and other insect pests occurred throughout the Qu Zhuangtou village area. The Qu Yaoli mutual aid team used more than 230 workdays to control the insects continuously for more than 20 days. Qu Yaoli said with emotion: "Without the collective strength of the mutual aid team, it would not be possible to overcome so many disasters, and the cotton would not be able to produce a bumper harvest."

The Qu Yaoli mutual aid team's belief in the scientific and technical guidance of the People's Government and state-owned farms is also one of the reasons for this year's bumper harvest. After the pest infestation occurred in July this year, most of the peaches on the upper nodes of the cotton seedlings were damaged. On average, each cotton plant had only a little more than nine peaches, and it was estimated that only a little more than 500 jin of seed cotton could be harvested per mu. However, because they accepted the Yuncheng Farm's suggestion to strengthen late-stage pruning and late topping, the cotton stopped shedding bolls and grew many new cotton peaches, averaging an increase to fifteen peaches per plant. Qu Yaoli's nine mu of high-yield land increased from 590 jin to 834 jin per mu under these circumstances. Therefore, Qu Yaoli said: "Under the new circumstances, old experiences are unreliable. This year, we listened to the government, and we harvested more than 200 jin of cotton per mu."

### 曲耀离互助组战胜自然灾害获得棉花丰产

    曲耀离互助组战胜自然灾害获得棉花丰产
    全国著名棉花丰产模范曲耀离和他领导的互助组，今年战胜了严重的自然灾害，全组的棉花都丰产了。今年曲耀离互助组的棉花平均产量和他家乡山西省解县曲庄头全村棉花的平均产量，都占运城专区的第一位。
    今年曲耀离互助组共种七十三亩二分水地和旱地的棉花，实收三万八千一百一十九斤籽棉，平均每亩收五百二十斤十二两，超过当地平均产量百分之五十六点三五。全组达到中央人民政府农业部水地棉花高额丰产奖励标准的有十三亩，其中曲耀离的九亩丰产地，平均每亩收到八百三十四斤籽棉；达到中央人民政府农业部旱地棉花丰产奖励标准的有六亩。解县曲庄头村农民在曲耀离先进经验的直接帮助下，全村九百六十亩零七分八厘水地和旱地棉花获得全面丰产，共收三十一万九千九百九十九斤十一两籽棉，平均每亩三百三十三斤。
    曲耀离互助组在秋季评比总结今年的丰产经验时，大家一致感到组织起来集体劳动力量的伟大。去年曲耀离互助组只有四户，今年发展到八户，因而劳动组织更加科学，分工更加细致。今春下种时，原计划四天完成，结果两天就全部种完了。劳动效率提高后，棉田加工就更加充分，耕作技术也大大改进。如间苗工作，由去年的三次定苗发展为今年的四次定苗；去年是小畦轻浇，今年发展为开沟透浇。在密植、后期整枝、防治虫害等方面，也都有了新的发展。今年三四月间，棉苗发生立枯病，棉田形成严重的缺苗现象，为了挽救这一灾害，曲耀离全组便百折不挠地进行移苗补苗。棉苗死了，移补上；再死了，再移补上，整整坚持了
    一个多月。曲耀离七亩棉田共移苗一千多株，成活了八百多株。七月间，曲庄头村一带普遍发生棉铃虫、造桥虫和盲椿象虫等虫害，曲耀离互助组又用了二百三十多个工，连续治虫二十多天。曲耀离感动地说：“没有互助组的集体力量，就不可能战胜这样多的灾害，棉花也就不能丰产。”
    曲耀离互助组相信人民政府和国营农场的科学技术指导，也是今年丰产的一个原因。今年七月虫害发生后，棉苗上节桃子大部损害，平均每株棉花只有九个多桃子，估计每亩只能收到五百多斤籽棉。但是，由于他们接受了运城农场加强后期整枝和晚打顶的建议，就使棉花停止落铃，还新长出许多棉桃，平均每株增加到十五个桃子。曲耀离的九亩丰产地，就是在这样的情况下，每亩由五百九十斤增加到八百三十四斤。因此，曲耀离说：“在新情况下，老经验就靠不住了。今年听了政府的话，每亩多收了二百多斤棉花。”    （新华社）
