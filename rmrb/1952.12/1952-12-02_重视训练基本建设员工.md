    Emphasize Training Basic Construction Employees
    Editor: As the nation's large-scale economic construction is about to begin, leading cadres of factories and mines should seize the time to conduct training for basic construction employees. The phenomenon of neglecting the training of basic construction employees is still very common. At the Liulihe Cement Plant, a month and a half ago, there was only one cadre responsible for employee training, and he spent most of his time on other work every day, neglecting employee training. At the Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory, only one cadre is responsible for employee training, and he has been transferred to do other work for a long time. Some professional bureau employee training sections have lacked section chiefs and technical personnel for a long time, making it impossible to carry out work, and the staff in the section have nothing to do. Employees don't even know what the employee training section does.

    Therefore, I hope that leading cadres of factories and mines will immediately allocate stronger cadres to be specifically responsible for employee training. The employee training work of factories and mines that is attached to the personnel department should be immediately expanded in organization to form groups or sections. According to the needs of basic construction and production, quickly formulate plans for training technicians in various trades, establish technical schools at all levels, and organize curriculum research groups. The training of technicians can be carried out in various ways, and the basic spirit should be "fast," "good," "specialized," and "numerous."

### 重视训练基本建设员工

    重视训练基本建设员工
    编辑同志：国家大规模经济建设将开始之际，厂矿企业的领导干部，应抓紧进行基本建设员工的训练工作。目前不重视基本建设员工训练的现象，还很普遍。琉璃河水泥厂，一个半月以前，就仅有一个干部负责员工训练工作，而且，他每天大部分时间都忙着搞其它工作，放松了对员工的训练。唐山启新磁厂负责员工训练的干部，也只有一人，且曾长期被调去干旁的工作。有的专业局员工训练科，长期没有科长和技术人员，工作无法开展，科里工作人员没有工作可做。职工也不知道员工训练科是干什么的。
    因此，我希望厂矿企业领导干部，应立即调配较强的干部专责负责员工训练工作。厂矿员工训练工作附属在人事部门的要马上扩大组织，成立组或科。根据基本建设和生产需要，迅速拟订培养各个工种的技工计划，设立各级技术学校，组织课程研究小组。技工的培养，可用多种方式进行，基本精神要“快”，要“好”，要“专”，要“多”。
