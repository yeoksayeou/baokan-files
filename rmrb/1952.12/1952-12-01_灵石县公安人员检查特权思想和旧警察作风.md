    Lingshi County Public Security Personnel Examine Privilege Mentality and Old Police Work Style

    To the Editor:
    Under the guidance of the Public Security Department of Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Public Security Bureau of Yuci Prefecture, all public security personnel of the Public Security Bureau of Lingshi County People's Government have conducted a relatively serious examination of privilege mentality and old police work style. The results of the examination show that the privilege mentality, old police work style, and bureaucracy among our public security personnel are very serious. This is mainly manifested in the lack of thoroughness in our work. For example, during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries last year, we mistakenly listened to the false accusation of the counter-revolutionary Qin Yinxi and wrongly detained the innocent Zhang Yonggui for more than three months. The most serious issue is that the Fujiatan Police Station under our bureau arbitrarily arrested people without approval, more than twenty times from last year to September this year. Although we have gone through the great "Three-Anti" Movement, there are still cases of cadres violating laws and neglecting their duties. For example, Zhang Lizhong, the deputy head of the "Political Security Section," extorted property from a counter-revolutionary prisoner while escorting him, almost allowing the prisoner to escape. Furthermore, due to the lack of clarity among some cadres regarding the nature of today's people's democratic regime, the phenomenon of extracting confessions by torture is also serious. They mistakenly think, "We can't beat good people, but can't we beat bad people?" "We have to beat criminals!" After the examination, everyone has taken a step forward in their thinking and realized that privilege mentality and old police work style are bad thoughts and bad styles that our people's public security personnel should not have; they have realized that this seriously harms the interests of the Party and the people, will alienate the Party from the masses, and will cause undue losses to the people. In order to consolidate the results of the examination, the leadership has decided: 1. To strengthen organizational life and regularly conduct criticism and self-criticism. 2. To continuously struggle against all erroneous behaviors that violate laws and regulations as one of the methods of educating and improving cadres. 3. To clearly define the division of powers and formulate working systems.

    灵石县公安人员检查特权思想和旧警察作风
    编辑同志：山西灵石县人民政府公安局全体公安人员，在省人民政府公安厅和榆次专署公安处指示下，已经比较认真地检查了特权思想和旧警察作风。检查结果，说明我们公安人员中的特权思想、旧警察作风和官僚主义是十分严重的。主要表现在工作的不深入。如去年镇压反革命运动中，我们曾经偏听了反革命分子秦银喜的诬告，把无辜的张永贵错压了三月多。最严重的是我局所属富家滩派出所的不经批准即随意捕人，自去年到今年九月就有过二十多次。虽然经过了伟大的“三反”运动，但仍有干部违法失职的现象。如“政保股”副股长张立忠，在押解反革命犯途中，竟向犯人索取财物，几乎使犯人逃跑。还有，由于某些干部对今天人民民主政权的性质不明确，所以刑讯逼供的现象也是严重的。他们错误地想：“不打好人吧，还不能打坏人？”“对犯人非打不行！”经过检查，大家在思想上提高了一步，认识到特权思想和旧警察作风，是我们人民公安人员不应有的坏思想、坏作风；认识到这严重地危害着党和人民的利益，会使党脱离了群众，会使人民遭到不应有的损失。为了巩固检查结果，领导上已决定：一、加强组织生活，经常开展批评和自我批评。二、以经常向一切违法乱纪的错误行为进行斗争，作为教育、提高干部的方法之一。三、明确划分职权，并订定工作制度。
