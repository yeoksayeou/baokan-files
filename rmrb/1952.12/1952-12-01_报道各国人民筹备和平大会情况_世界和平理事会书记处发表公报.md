Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 30th: According to TASS, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council issued a communiqué on November 26th regarding the progress of the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress. The communiqué stated:

    The declaration issued by the World Peace Council calling for the convocation of the World People's Peace Congress has spread to all countries around the world, attracting great attention from all peace-loving men and women.

    Preparatory committees have been organized in the United States, Britain, Brazil, Germany, Algeria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Venezuela, Paraguay, and other countries. In Austria, 312 leaders of different opinions and professions have jointly signed a declaration announcing their readiness to welcome delegates from various countries and welcome the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna.

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, with representatives from 37 countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, made a tremendous contribution to the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress. The conference adopted a resolution in support of the World People's Peace Congress.

    The recent International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Problem, held in Berlin with prominent leaders from 15 European countries, decided to send a delegation to the World People's Peace Congress to present the resolutions passed by the conference. The members of this delegation will participate in the World People's Peace Congress as observers.

    Many trade unions in Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Australia, and Belgium will make significant contributions to the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress. Many of them have already elected representatives. Nordic workers have also elected a nine-member delegation at the Nordic Workers' Peace Conference to attend the Vienna Congress. These examples demonstrate the unprecedentedly active participation of workers from various countries, united in different trade unions, in the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress.

    The composition of the delegations that are already known indicates that representatives from the broadest peasant class of the people will participate in the congress.

    Farmers' organizations and leaders in India are participating in the preparatory movement; farmers' organizations and leaders in Italy are electing representatives to attend the congress; farmers' organizations and leaders in France held a widespread national farmers' peace conference, which decided to send twelve representatives to Vienna.

    Many scientists and other intellectuals are announcing their support for the World People's Peace Congress.

    Painters Matisse and Picasso, Louis Aragon, Sartre, Madane-Chauffe, Benda and Vercors and nineteen French writers, Brazilian writers Ramos, Amado, Chilean poet Mistral, German writers Anna Seghers and Brecht, have all issued statements supporting the congress. Scientists, professors, and world-renowned doctors from Italy, Japan, and India have also issued similar statements.

    In the political circles of many countries—Italy, Germany, India, Iran, Egypt, Argentina, Mexico, and Africa—especially among members of parliament, prominent leaders have either announced their willingness to participate in the congress or have publicly announced their support for it. Following the exchange of letters between Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, and Nitti, member of the Italian Parliament and Chairman of the Parliamentary Union for Peace, many Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and non-partisan leaders and groups have decided to participate in the World People's Peace Congress.

    All party leaders in Brazil and Chile support the World People's Peace Congress. In Britain, more than half of the representatives elected to attend the Vienna Congress are Labour Party members.

    The World People's Peace Congress has aroused great interest among industrialists and businessmen in many countries, especially Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Belgium, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. Several conferences exclusively discussing economic issues have also elected their representatives to participate in the World People's Peace Congress.

    Various churches and religious leaders are supporting the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress. Among them are Kashani, the current Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Pastor Niemöller, leader of the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Hesse, Bishop Barnes of North Birmingham, Dean Thompson of Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago, Bishop Cesar Dagoso of the Brazilian Lutheran Evangelical Union, Canon Maynard of Australia, representatives of the Brazilian Catholic Church and the Vatican's representative in Brazil, Boyer and Abbe Debierre of France; Greek Orthodox Archpriest Gregory Salan of Argentina, and Buddhist leaders from China, India, and Ceylon, have all announced that they will participate in or support the World People's Peace Congress.

    Women are participating particularly actively in the preparatory work and are launching various movements—for example, Mother's Day in France, the "Save Our Children" movement in the United States, the British women's peace petition, and the Czechoslovak women's letter to American women.

    Many women's organizations will participate in the congress, such as the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, etc.

    Young people have carried out extensive preparatory work to welcome the World People's Peace Congress. The youth relay race, carrying messages from young people around the world, is approaching Vienna.

    At the same time, it should be pointed out that the German Youth Congress in Düsseldorf has elected seven representatives to participate in the World People's Peace Congress. Representatives from the Social Democratic Youth, the Free German Youth League, the Christian Lutheran Evangelical Youth Association, and the Catholic Youth participated in this congress. The famous Czechoslovak champion Zatopek is a representative participating in the World People's Peace Congress. Olympic champion Ferenc Puskas (captain of the Hungarian football team) will also go to Vienna. Other well-known athletes, such as Enzo Sacchi, Italian Olympic champion, Rick Van Steenbergen, Belgian cycling champion, Stan Stenkorte-Orskes and Hippanisdo have also expressed their support for the upcoming World People's Peace Congress.

    Many countries—the Soviet Union, China, Italy, France, Czechoslovakia, Bolivia, Japan, Bulgaria, Argentina, Albania, Britain, Canada, etc.—have convened or are convening local, regional, and national conferences to elect representatives to participate in the World People's Peace Congress.

    Based on materials received so far from seventy countries, more than 1,500 delegates are already on their way to Vienna. In addition, more than twenty international organizations have announced that they will send representatives to participate in the congress. This preliminary figure demonstrates the large scale of the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress and the unwavering determination of the people of the world to defend peace.

    在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，有亚洲及太平洋区域的三十七个国家的代表参加，这个会议对于世界人民和平大会的筹备工作有巨大的贡献，这个会议已通过了一项拥护世界人民和平大会的决议。
    最近在柏林举行的国际争取和平解决德国问题会议有十五个欧洲国家的著名领袖参加，会议已决定派遣代表团向世界人民和平大会提出会议所通过的各项决议。这个代表团的团员们将以观察员的身份参加世界人民和平大会。
    英国、美国、法国、意大利、日本、加拿大、巴西、智利、澳大利亚和比利时的许多工会将对世界人民和平大会的筹备工作作出很大的贡献。它们中间有许多已经选出了代表。北欧工人也已在北欧工人和平会议上选出了一个九人代表团参加维也纳大会。这些例子证明团结在不同的工会里的各国工人空前积极地参加了世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。
    已经知道的代表团的组成，说明将有人民中最广大的农民阶层的代表参加大会。
    印度的农民团体和领袖正在参加筹备运动；意大利的农民团体和领袖正选举代表参加大会，法国的农民团体和领袖举行了一次广泛的全国农民和平大会，大会决定派遣十二名代表到维也纳去。

    在许多国家——意大利、德国、印度、伊朗、埃及、阿根廷、墨西哥和非洲——的政治界中，特别是在议会议员中，著名的领袖们或者已经宣布他们愿意参加大会，或者已经公开宣布支持大会。在世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里和意大利议会自由党议员、议会联合和平委员会主席尼蒂交换信件后，许多社会民主党、天主教民主党和无党无派的领袖和团体都已经决定参加世界人民和平大会。
    巴西和智利的所有的党派领袖都支持世界人民和平大会。在英国，这次选出来参加维也纳大会的代表中一半以上是工党党员。
    世界人民和平大会引起了许多国家，特别是德国、意大利、法国、日本、比利时、巴西、阿根廷和澳大利亚的工商业人士的极大兴趣。纯粹讨论经济问题的若干会议也选出它们参加世界人民和平大会的代表。
    各种教会和宗教领袖都支持世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。其中有现任伊朗议会议长卡沙尼，黑森州信义福音会领袖尼美勒牧师，北明翰主教巴纳斯，芝加哥大学洛克菲勒教堂教长汤普逊，巴西信义福音会联盟主教西撒·达高索，澳大利亚的坎农·梅纳德，巴西天主教会代表、梵蒂冈驻巴西代表，法国的勃耶和阿贝·德比埃；阿根廷的希腊教院主哥里格列·萨兰，以及中国、印度和锡兰的佛教领袖，他们都宣布他们将参加或支持世界人民和平大会。
    妇女正在特别积极地参加筹备工作，并且发起各种运动——例如，法国的母亲节、美国的“救救我们的孩子”运动、英国妇女的和平请愿、捷克斯洛伐克妇女的致美国妇女书。
    许多妇女组织都将参加大会，例如，国际民主妇女联合会，国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟等。
    青年们进行了广泛的准备工作、来迎接世界人民和平大会。传递全世界青年的消息的青年接力跑已接近维也纳。
    同时应该指出：杜塞尔多夫的德国青年代表大会已选出了七位代表参加世界人民和平大会。参加这个代表大会的有：社会民主党青年，自由德国青年联盟，基督教信义福音青年会与天主教青年的代表。著名的捷克斯洛伐克锦标选手萨托皮克是参加世界人民和平大会的一位代表。奥林匹克锦标选手佛兰克·甫斯卡斯（匈牙利足球队队长）亦将到维也纳去。其他闻名的运动家，如奥林匹克运动会的意大利锦标选手恩佐·沙克斯西，比利时自行车竞赛的锦标选手瑞克·范，斯丹布琴·斯考特·欧斯克斯与印潘尼斯都表示拥护即将举行的世界人民和平大会。
