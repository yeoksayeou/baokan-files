Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council
Announcement Regarding Several Revisions to the Tax System and the Effective Date

In accordance with the development of the national financial and economic situation and the needs of national economic construction, this Committee, having reported to and been approved by the 164th Administration Council meeting, has made several revisions to the current tax system under the principles of ensuring tax revenue and simplifying tax payment procedures. It is decided that these revisions will be implemented from January 1, 1953.

(A) Trial Implementation of Commodity Circulation Tax

I. The trial implementation measures for the commodity circulation tax are hereby announced for implementation (attached: Trial Implementation Measures for Commodity Circulation Tax) (see today's second page – Editor).

II. After gaining experience through trial implementation, certain items subject to commodity tax that can be converted to commodity circulation tax will be gradually converted upon approval by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and verification by this Committee.

III. After the announcement of the trial implementation measures for commodity circulation tax, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government will announce detailed rules regarding collection and payment procedures.

(B) Revisions Regarding Commodity Tax

I. Manufacturers producing taxable goods shall pay the stamp tax, business tax, and business tax surcharges originally payable, all of which are incorporated into the commodity tax. The current commodity tax items and tax rates will be adjusted accordingly (attached: Revised Commodity Tax Items and Tax Rate Table) (see today's second page – Editor).

II. Taxable goods shall uniformly be assessed based on the wholesale price of state-owned companies; this applies equally to processing, ordering, and exclusive sales arrangements. If state-owned companies do not have a wholesale price, the local market wholesale price may be used for tax assessment.

III. The provision in Article 6 of the Interim Regulations on Commodity Tax, "Formulas for Calculating the Taxable Price and Tax Payable of Commodity Tax," is revised to calculate the tax payable by multiplying the tax rate by the price of the taxable goods.

(C) Revisions Regarding Industrial and Commercial Tax

I. Business Tax Section:

	1. The stamp tax, business tax, and business tax surcharges payable by industrial and commercial enterprises are all incorporated into the business tax and calculated at the combined tax rate (attached: Comparison Table of Graded Business Tax Rates After Combination) (see today's second page – Editor). The original "Business Tax Rate Table by Industry" will be adjusted by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government with reference to the industry standards established by the National Bureau of Statistics and will be announced separately for implementation.

	2. Goods on which commodity circulation tax has already been paid are no longer subject to business tax.

	3. Goods on which commodity tax has already been paid are still subject to business tax when wholesaled or retailed by commercial vendors.

	4. Goods not subject to commodity circulation tax and goods not subject to commodity tax, whether sold by industry or commerce, are all subject to business tax.

	5. The provision that "processing income is taxed at the rate of the respective industry, but not less than 1.5 percent" is revised, and the processing income tax rate is uniformly adjusted to 5 percent.

	6. For agency purchases, agency sales, or exclusive sales, taxes are uniformly calculated based on the purchase and sale of goods.

	7. Article 8 of the Implementing Rules of the Interim Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax, which stipulates that "mutual transfer of goods...between the head office and branches of industrial and commercial enterprises shall not be regarded as a business transaction and shall not be subject to business tax," is revised to state that industrial head offices and branches, from production and wholesale to retail, shall pay three levels of business tax; the manufacturing portion of business tax that has been incorporated into the commodity tax shall only be subject to wholesale and retail business taxes. Commercial head offices and branches, from wholesale to retail, shall pay two levels of business tax.

	8. Factories selling products not subject to commodity circulation tax or commodity tax shall pay two levels of business tax, according to industrial tax rates and commercial tax rates, respectively.

	9. The provision in Article 11, Paragraph 3 of the Interim Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax, which states that "for continuous production industries, if the tax rates of several products are different, the lower tax rate shall be applied," is revised to calculate taxes based on the industry tax rate to which the product belongs at the time of sale.

	11. Article 73 of the Implementing Rules of the Interim Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax, which stipulates that when a taxpayer applies for reconsideration, they should "pay the full amount of the assessed tax," is revised to require that 70 percent of the assessed tax be paid into the treasury first.

	2. The provisions in the Temporary Commercial Tax Collection and Management Measures regarding tax exemption for farmers, fishermen, herdsmen, and hunters selling their own products with self-production and self-sale certificates are revised, and the threshold is adjusted to 200,000 yuan. With the exception of settled merchants, all those who sell goods reaching the threshold shall uniformly pay temporary commercial tax. However, the following considerations must still be given to farmers, fishermen, herdsmen, and hunters:

		(1) Farmers selling their own agricultural and sideline products and livestock in rural market towns are exempt from temporary commercial tax; farmers near urban areas selling their own agricultural and sideline products and livestock to cities may be issued long-term certificates by the local tax authorities and are exempt from temporary commercial tax.

		(2) Fishermen selling their own aquatic products shall be issued long-term certificates by the local tax authorities and are exempt from temporary commercial tax.

		(3) Herdsmen and hunters selling their own livestock or hunted goods are exempt from temporary commercial tax.

IV. Simplifying Tax Payment Procedures for Small-Scale Industrial and Commercial Households and Vendors

The business tax and income tax payable by small-scale industrial and commercial households and vendors shall be calculated using a simplified method and paid monthly. Those with monthly sales of less than 900,000 yuan or income of less than 600,000 yuan are exempt from industrial and commercial tax.
