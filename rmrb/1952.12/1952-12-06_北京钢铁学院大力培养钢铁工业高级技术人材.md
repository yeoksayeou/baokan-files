The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel, which specializes in training advanced technical talents for the iron and steel industry, was born on the eve of our country's large-scale economic construction. This is a completely new type of higher industrial school, and it trains talents based on the advanced technical knowledge and production experience of the Soviet iron and steel industry, as well as the advanced teaching methods and experience of the Soviet Metallurgical Institute.

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel was formed by merging the mining and metallurgy departments of the former Tianjin University, the mining and metallurgy departments of the Beijing Institute of Technology, the metallurgy department of Shanxi University, the metallurgy and materials departments of Tangshan Railway Institute, and the metallurgy department of Northwest Institute of Technology. The original second- and third-year students from various schools totaled 437 (including one graduate student). This autumn, 408 new and returning students were enrolled, bringing the total number of students in the institute to 845. The third-year students from the merged schools are currently all interning in factories and mines, while the first- and second-year students are temporarily attending classes at Tsinghua University.

In terms of teaching, the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel has formulated teaching plans for various majors based on the teaching plans of Soviet metallurgical, mining, and other higher industrial schools. Based on the current situation in our country, the five-year teaching plan of Soviet higher industrial schools has been changed to four years, and general courses have been compressed. At the same time, 112 kinds of teaching syllabuses have been collected. After ideological remolding and the "Three-Anti" movement, the teachers who came from various schools and were transferred to the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government enthusiastically requested to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In particular, the teachers who participated in the formulation of the teaching plan deeply appreciated the superiority of the Soviet teaching plan and teaching syllabus. Therefore, they actively strengthened the teaching preparation work, which significantly improved the quality of teaching.

The first- and second-year students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel are now studying basic courses intensively, and their academic performance is generally very good. Some students transferred from the military and government agencies, due to their poor mathematical foundation, are working hard to overcome difficulties under the strengthened guidance of teachers and the mutual assistance of classmates in order to catch up with the progress. In order to strengthen the guidance of the third-year students who are currently interning, the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel has assigned 24 teaching staff and formulated a relatively detailed teaching plan and internship plan. They adopt the method of lecturing while interning, with teachers lecturing in conjunction with practical work.

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel began preparations in April this year. By the end of October, most of the students and teachers had arrived. The second and third grades opened on October 27, and the first grade opened on November 3. They are temporarily attending classes and working in Tsinghua University. Next year, the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel will build new school buildings in Manjing Village near Tsinghua University. A construction preparation organization has been established to carry out design work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京钢铁学院大力培养钢铁工业高级技术人材
    专门培养钢铁工业高级技术人材的北京钢铁学院，在我国大规模经济建设前夕诞生了。这是一所完全新型的高等工业学校，它是以苏联钢铁工业的先进技术知识与生产经验及苏联冶金学院的先进教学方法与经验为标准来培养人材的。
    北京钢铁学院是由原天津大学的采矿系和冶金系、北京工学院的采矿系和冶金系、山西大学的冶金系、唐山铁道学院的冶金系和材料系及西北工学院的冶金系合并组成，各校原有二、三年级学生共四百三十七名（包括研究生一名），今年秋季新招学生和复学学生共四百零八名，现全院共有学生八百四十五名。各校并来的三年级学生目前全部在厂矿中实习，一、二年级的学生暂在清华大学内上课。
    在教学方面，北京钢铁学院已根据苏联冶金、采矿等高等工业学校的教学计划拟订了各种专业的教学计划，并根据我国目前的情况，将苏联高等工业学校的五年教学计划改为四年，将一般课程予以压缩；同时搜集了一百一十二种教学大纲。从各校合并来和由中央人民政府教育部从其他学校调到北京钢铁学院的教师们，经过思想改造和“三反”运动以后，热烈要求学习苏联先进经验，特别是参加拟订教学计划的教师们，深切体会到苏联教学计划和教学大纲的优越性，因此积极加强教学准备工作，使教学质量显著提高。
    北京钢铁学院一、二年级的学生现在正紧张地学习基础课程，学习成绩一般很好。一部分从部队、机关调来的学生，因数学基础较差，正在教师加强辅导与同学互助之下，努力克服困难，以便赶上进度。为了加强对正在实习的三年级学生的指导，北京钢铁学院配备了教学人员二十四人，拟订了比较周密的教学计划和实习计划；采取边实习边讲授的办法，由教师们结合实际工作进行讲授。
    北京钢铁学院在今年四月间开始筹备，到十月底学生、教师大部分到齐，二、三年级在十月二十七日开学，一年级在十一月三日开学，暂时在清华大学内上课和办公。明年北京钢铁学院将在清华大学附近满井村建筑新校舍，现已成立建校筹备机构，进行设计工作。（新华社）
