    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 24th: French Prime Minister Pinay submitted his cabinet's resignation to President Auriol on the morning of the 23rd. The reason for the resignation was that the 1953 financial bill proposed by Pinay caused open divisions within the parliamentary majority supporting the government. The parliamentary group of the Popular Republican Movement announced that its members would abstain from the vote of confidence requested by Pinay on the issue of family allowances. After learning of the decision of the Popular Republican Movement's parliamentary group, Pinay told the parliament that the government's majority had abandoned him. He then left the National Assembly and went to the Élysée Palace to submit his resignation to President Auriol.

    法国比内内阁倒台
    【新华社二十四日讯】巴黎消息：法国总理比内在二十三日晨向总统阿里奥尔提出内阁辞呈。辞职的原因是因为比内所提出的一九五三年财政法案引起支持政府的议会多数派内部公开的分歧，人民共和党议会党团宣布它的议员在比内所要求的关于家庭津贴问题的信任投票上将弃权。比内在得知人民共和党议会党团的决定后向议会说，政府的多数已经背弃了他。接着他就离开国民议会，到爱丽舍宫向总统阿里奥尔提出辞呈。
