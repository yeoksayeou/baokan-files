(I) Do a Good Job in the Winter Training of Basic Construction Workers

Our basic construction strength, although it has grown rapidly recently and continues to grow, is still far behind the needs of next year. We not only lack administrative leaders, political work cadres, and technical personnel, but also lack the grassroots backbone and skilled workers for construction. If we do not take a proactive attitude to change this situation, it will inevitably affect basic construction next year.

It is very necessary to actively use the idle time in winter construction to concentrate on training newly fixed basic construction workers and original long-term basic construction workers this winter. Through this training, the political awareness and technical level of workers can be universally improved, and a large number of grassroots cadres can be cultivated from them to purify and strengthen the basic construction team. Therefore, we must list the training of basic construction workers as one of the central tasks this winter.

According to current understanding, the winter training of basic construction workers has not been carried out well in most cities, except for a few cities that have started and achieved some results. Some are delayed, some lack direction and methods, and some are indifferent to the specific problems existing in winter training. Some leaders verbally support putting basic construction in a primary position, but in reality, they ignore the specific work of cultivating basic construction forces and abandon the leadership of winter training for basic construction workers, leaving winter training work unattended and laissez-faire. This attitude is obviously very wrong. In some places, when fixing and training basic construction workers, they resort to coercion and recruit some farmers who come to the city to find temporary work. There is no guarantee that these farmers will be fixed as construction workers in the future. Some do not follow the principle of voluntariness and forcibly order some workers who are unwilling to be trained to participate in winter training. Some only proceed from the point of view of relief, hoping to gather all the unemployed people together for training. This attitude or practice is certainly not right.

Now the time for the start of construction next year is very close. Before construction, there is still much preparatory work to be done. Regions and departments with basic construction tasks next year, especially those with more fixed basic construction workers and significant basic construction tasks next year, should immediately start, seize the time, and organize winter training for basic construction workers.

The content of winter training for basic construction workers should include both political education and technical training. According to the experience of some regions, after the trainees are gathered, they can first stipulate about ten days to hold discussions and study the situation, experience, and problems that occurred in basic construction work in 1952, so that the leadership can grasp the real situation and correctly solve the problems in administrative management, political work, and technical measures in basic construction. Then, political education and technical training are carried out in turn.

The content of this year's winter training political education for basic construction workers is mainly to enlighten class consciousness and establish the working class's sense of responsibility as masters of the country. To this end, political education should explain and discuss the great achievements of the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, as well as the prospects for national industrialization and the vision of socialism and communism; explain and discuss issues related to labor organization, labor discipline, labor competition, and the necessity of learning from advanced Soviet experience, so that trainees can understand the inevitable trend of gradually realizing mechanization in construction and factory production in civil engineering, enhance collectivism, overcome the influence of lax habits and guild ideas, establish a correct attitude towards labor, and abide by labor discipline; explain and discuss the state's wage policy, labor insurance policy, safety and welfare measures, and the principles of democratic management, so that trainees can recognize the consistency of personal interests and national interests under the labor policy of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and that individuals should obey the needs of the country and engage in creative labor; finally, it should explain and discuss the importance of strengthening the leadership of the Communist Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League in national construction, so that trainees can understand the relationship between the Party, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the working class. In terms of methods, in addition to paying attention to leading discussions and coordinating various lively forms (such as movies, dramas, reading newspapers, discussions, and introducing typical figures and events, etc.), we should learn from the successful experience of some units in deeply solving workers' specific ideological problems by linking workers' personal experiences and comparing the old and new societies. On the basis of raising workers' awareness, develop trade union members and admit outstanding workers into the Party and the Communist Youth League according to the conditions.

On the basis of preliminarily raising the class consciousness of the trainees through political education, we must concentrate our efforts on technical education. The content of technical education is mainly to conduct education on operating procedures by summarizing and learning from various advanced experiences in basic construction this year, especially important advanced experiences, and to conduct education on technical standards and quality standards in conjunction with next year's engineering tasks. In technical education, we should not only pay attention to the advanced experience of civil engineering and cultivate civil engineering workers, but also pay special attention to the advanced experience of mechanical and electrical installation, mechanical operation, electric welding pipelines, and geological drilling, and cultivate special technical workers. Because without these workers, we cannot adapt to the needs of large-scale modern construction. In technical education, groups can be organized according to the nature of the work to summarize and learn from the advanced technical operations and labor organization experience of each type of work, and at the same time, seriously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in these areas. In addition to the necessary lectures, the educational methods should also adopt more discussion meetings combining technicians and workers, performance meetings of advanced producers, and other methods to educate workers with facts so that they can further eliminate various ideological obstacles and concerns. At the same time, we must directly adopt the method of practice so that workers not only believe but also can master advanced technology. In the winter training of basic construction workers in Northeast China, more than 20,000 workers in mechanical and electrical installation, mechanical operation, and mine construction were taught using a method that combines theory and practice. In addition to skilled technicians contracting on-site teaching, technicians or Soviet experts regularly lectured on simple and easy-to-understand scientific principles, so that trainees could learn to operate concrete mixers, winches, cranes, electric shovels, and other machinery, or initially master electric welding, oxyacetylene welding, and other technologies within three months. This approach is correct and will play an important guarantee role for next year's construction, especially the construction of important projects.

In addition to training a large number of basic construction workers, this year's winter training should also provide political education for construction workers, site directors, and various management personnel and technicians on the construction site, and conduct relevant business education according to their different positions, so that they can skillfully complete their tasks in basic construction next year. In addition, a large number of key construction personnel—construction workers—should be trained and promoted from among the skilled workers. This is a major method to solve the current shortage of construction technical forces and should be regarded as one of the main goals and key tasks of winter training.

Whether the winter training of basic construction workers can be effective depends on the leadership of the local Party committee, basic construction department, trade union, and Communist Youth League, etc. Under the direct responsibility of the local Party committee, a winter training committee should be organized, and a special agency should be established, and capable cadres and technicians should be assigned to be responsible for political education, technical education, and organization and general affairs. The materials for political and technical education must be prepared in advance so that winter training can be carried out in an organized and planned manner. At the same time, regular inspections should be carried out to solve specific problems in a timely manner, which will be one of the important guarantees for completing this task.

### （一）做好基本建设工人的冬训工作

    （一）做好基本建设工人的冬训工作
    我们的基本建设力量，虽然已在最近期间迅速增长起来并继续增长着，但仍远远落后于明年的需要。我们不仅缺乏行政领导干部、政治工作干部和技术人员，而且缺乏施工的基层骨干和技术工人。对于这种情况，如果不采取积极的态度加以改变，势必影响到明年的基本建设。
    积极利用冬季施工空闲时间，集中今冬新固定下来的基本建设工人和原有的长年基本建设工人进行训练，是非常必要的。经过这种训练，可以普遍提高工人的政治觉悟和技术水平，从中培养大批基层干部，以纯洁和壮大基本建设队伍。因此，我们必须把训练基本建设工人的工作，列为今年冬季中心工作之一。
    据目前了解，基本建设工人的冬训工作，除少数城市已开始进行并已取得若干成绩以外，多数城市尚未很好进行。有的拖延不动，有的则缺乏方针和办法，有的对冬训中存在的具体问题漠不关心。有一些领导人在口头上拥护把基本建设放到首要地位，但实际上却漠视培养基本建设力量的具体工作，放弃对基本建设工人冬训工作的领导，使冬训工作无人负责，放任自流。这种态度显然是十分错误的。也有一些地方，在固定和训练基本建设工人时，拉伕凑数，招收了一些到城市临时找工作的农民。这些农民将来是否能固定为建筑工人还无保证。有的则不按照自愿的原则，强迫命令某些不愿受训的工人参加冬训。有的只从救济观点出发，希图把一切失业的人都集中起来加以训练。这种态度或作法当然也是不对的。
    现在离明年施工开始的时间已经很近了。在施工以前，还有许多准备工作要做。明年有基本建设任务的地区和部门，特别是那些固定基本建设工人较多和明年基本建设任务重大的地区和部门，应该立即动手，抓紧时间，组织基本建设工人的冬训工作。
    基本建设工人的冬训内容，应该包括政治教育和技术训练两个方面。根据某些地区的经验，在受训的基本建设工人集中之后，可先规定十天左右时间，座谈研究一九五二年内基本建设工作的情况、经验和发生的问题，以便领导方面掌握真实情况，正确解决基本建设中行政管理、政治工作和技术措施等方面的问题。然后依次进行政治教育和技术训练。
    今年基本建设工人冬训政治教育的内容，主要是启发阶级觉悟，树立工人阶级作为国家主人翁的责任感。为此，在政治教育中应讲解和讨论新中国在共产党和工人阶级领导下的伟大成就及国家工业化前途和社会主义、共产主义的远景；讲解和讨论劳动组织、劳动纪律、劳动竞赛方面的问题和学习苏联先进经验的必要性，使受训工人认识工业基本建设逐步实现施工中的机械化和土木建筑中的工厂化的必然趋势，提高集体主义精神，克服散漫习气和行会思想的影响，树立正确的劳动态度，遵守劳动纪律；讲解和讨论国家的工资政策、劳动保险政策、安全福利措施和民主管理的原则，使受训工人认识在共产党和人民政府的劳动政策下，个人利益和国家利益的一致，个人应服从国家的需要，从事创造性的劳动；最后应讲解和讨论在国家建设中加强共产党、工会、青年团的领导的重要性，使受训工人了解党、工会、青年团和工人阶级的关系。在方法上，除应注意领导讨论会，并配合各种生动活泼的形式（如电影、戏剧、读报、座谈及介绍典型人物与事例等）以外，应仿效某些单位联系工人切身的体验和经历，通过新旧社会的对比，深入解决工人具体思想问题的成功经验。在工人提高觉悟的基础上，发展工会会员，并按条件吸收工人中的优秀分子入党入团。
    在进行政治教育初步提高了受训工人的阶级觉悟的基础上，必须集中力量进行技术教育。技术教育的内容，主要是通过总结和学习今年基本建设中各项先进经验，特别是重要的先进经验，进行操作规程的教育，并结合明年的工程任务，进行技术标准和质量标准的教育。在技术教育中，不仅要注意土木建筑工程的先进经验，培养土木建筑工人，尤其要注意机电安装、机械操纵、电焊管道及地质钻探等工种的先进经验，培养特种技术工人。因为没有这些工人，就不能适应大规模的现代化建设的需要。在技术教育中可按工种性质组织小组，分别总结与学习各该工种的先进技术操作与劳动组织的经验，同时要认真研究苏联在这些方面的先进经验。教育的方法除必要的上课讲授外，应多采取由技术人员与工人结合的座谈会、先进生产者的表演会等方式，用事实教育工人，使他们进一步去掉各种思想障碍和顾虑。同时要直接采用实习的方法，使工人不仅信服而且能掌握先进技术。东北在基本建设工人冬训中，对两万多机电安装、机械操纵、矿井建设的工人采取理论与实践相结合的方法进行教学，除由熟练技术工人在现场分工包教以外，并由技术人员或苏联专家定期讲授简明易懂的科学原理，使受训学员在三个月内就能分别学会操纵混凝土搅拌机、卷扬机、起重机、电铲等机械，或初步掌握电焊、火焊等技术。这种作法是正确的，这对明年施工特别是重要工程的施工，将起重要的保证作用。
    今年的冬训除训练大量基本建设工人以外，对于施工员、工地主任及工地的各种管理人员、技术人员，也应该进行政治教育，并根据他们不同的职务，进行有关的业务教育，以便他们在明年基本建设中能够熟练地完成自己的任务。此外，应从技术工人中大量培养和提拔施工中的骨干——施工员。这是解决目前施工技术力量不足的一项主要方法，应作为冬训的主要目的和工作重点之一。
    基本建设工人冬训工作能否收效，决定于当地党委、基本建设部门、工会、青年团等的领导。在当地党委直接负责下，应组织冬训委员会，并成立专门机构，指定得力干部和技术人员分工担负政治教育、技术教育及组织、总务等工作。政治和技术教育的材料，必须事先准备，以便有组织有计划地进行冬训。同时要定期进行检查，及时解决具体问题，这将是完成这一任务的重要保证之一。
