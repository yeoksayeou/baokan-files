    Commemorating the Eighteenth Anniversary of Kirov's Assassination
    By A. Dmitriev of the Soviet Union
    Eighteen years have passed since the ignoble and shameless hands of the Trotsky-Bukharin hirelings of imperialism cut short the glorious life of Sergei Mironovich Kirov, an outstanding activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, an enthusiastic advocate of socialist revolution, and an excellent Communist-Leninist.

    The entire life of S.M. Kirov, a faithful student of Lenin and Stalin, was dedicated to the cause of liberating the working people and fighting for the victory of communism. Due to his outstanding genius as an organizer and leader of the revolutionary masses, and due to his irreconcilable struggle against the despicable enemies of the people—the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, and against all those who lacked confidence and surrendered—S.M. Kirov was promoted to the ranks of the great Stalin's comrades-in-arms. He participated in the leading core of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which, under Stalin's leadership, defended the great banner of Lenin, united the party around Lenin's testament, and guided the Soviet people towards the broad road of socialist victory.

    S.M. Kirov embarked on the path of revolutionary struggle at the age of eighteen. During the years of the First Russian Revolution (1905-1907), he was in Siberia. There, he enthusiastically carried out party activities and became a professional revolutionary. Despite arrests and several imprisonments by the Tsarist government, they could not destroy the will of this bold and fearless revolutionary-Leninist. From 1909, he conducted extensive propaganda work among the workers and mountain poor of the North Caucasus. During the years of the First World War, S.M. Kirov tirelessly fought to realize the Party's Leninist slogan of turning the imperialist war into a civil war. Until the Great October Revolution, his entire path of struggle was inseparable from the heroic struggle of Lenin and Stalin's party against the Tsarist regime and for the overthrow of the government of landlords and capitalists.

    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, S.M. Kirov devoted all his energy to consolidating the world's first worker-peasant state and defending the young Soviet Republic from all enemies, both domestic and foreign. During the years of the Civil War, he became an outstanding military activist and political educator of the Red Army. The heroic defense of Astrakhan against the attacks of the Denikin White Guard bandits and British interventionists is inseparable from the name of Kirov. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, S.M. Kirov turned Astrakhan into an impregnable outpost of Soviet power at the mouth of the Volga. In fighting friendship with V.V. Kuibyshev and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, S.M. Kirov participated in the implementation of Stalin's brilliant plan to crush the Denikin army. In a short period of time, the enemy forces in the North Caucasus were completely wiped out.

    After the end of the Civil War, S.M. Kirov carried out tremendous work in establishing and consolidating Soviet power in the Transcaucasus. He consistently and unwaveringly implemented the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, thereby laying the foundation for the unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation of the people of the Transcaucasus.

    At the Tenth Party Congress in 1921, S.M. Kirov was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee, and at the Twelfth Party Congress, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee. Until his death, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and served as a member of the Politburo and Secretary of the Central Committee.

    From 1921 to 1925, S.M. Kirov served as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan.

    S.M. Kirov, a faithful comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin, consistently and resolutely implemented the Party's general line at all stages of the struggle for socialist victory.

    In 1926, according to the will of the Party, S.M. Kirov led the Party organization in Leningrad. This was the period when the Soviet people began to implement the grand Stalin plan for industrializing the socialist country, and important tasks were assigned to Leningrad—to make it an arsenal of socialist industrialization. However, at that time, the Trotsky-Zinoviev capitulators who opposed Stalin's general line and opposed industrialization had already built their nests in the Leningrad organization. At the Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925, these defeated elements continued their treacherous and destructive work against the Party's policy.

    S.M. Kirov's strong hand and his tireless struggle for the Party's unity helped the Leningrad organization to quickly purge the Trotsky-Zinoviev renegades. Under the leadership of S.M. Kirov, the Communists of Leningrad became even more closely united around the Leninist-Stalinist Central Committee, and around the Party leader, Stalin. They transformed Leningrad into a powerful arsenal of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union.

    The veteran workers of Leningrad wrote in a letter to Stalin, "S.M. Kirov was ardent in his work and ignited others with his fiery enthusiasm" (Pravda, December 3, 1934). He devoted much energy to enabling industrial departments to master the production of new types of machines, machine tools, and turbines, to establishing new factories, and to improving the city's facilities. He paid special attention and care to the needs of every worker, and he instilled and strengthened in every worker the confidence in their own strength. S.M. Kirov was at the forefront of the soldiers fighting for the socialist transformation of agriculture. During the First Stalin Five-Year Plan, as a result of agricultural collectivization, the Leningrad Oblast transformed from a consuming region into one of the Soviet Union's largest producing regions.

    Implementing the instructions of the great Stalin, S.M. Kirov brilliantly solved the task of creating socialist industries in the Arctic region. The White Sea-Baltic Canal was excavated, and the northern port of Murmansk was expanded. S.M. Kirov expressed constant concern for the development of all fields of culture, science, and technology.

    Endowed with the greatest linguistic talent and the outstanding genius of an organizer, Kirov was an outstanding propagandist of Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Leninist-Stalinist ideas. As a Marxist-Leninist with profound knowledge, S.M. Kirov, together with Stalin and A.A. Zhdanov, made famous comments on the outline of the new history and Soviet history textbooks. He participated in the editing of "The History of the Civil War in the USSR."

    S.M. Kirov educated the cadres of the Party and the Communist Youth League in the spirit of communism, calling on them to constantly and creatively master Leninist-Stalinist teachings, and he safeguarded the Party's unity and the purity of its ranks as he would his own eyes. S.M. Kirov called for fighting all shortcomings hindering socialist construction with all the Bolshevik fury, demanding the continuous development of criticism and self-criticism. S.M. Kirov said, "Self-criticism, which unleashes the tremendous wave of mass creativity and initiative, gives socialist construction the most abundant strength and strengthens it on a large scale" (S.M. Kirov, "Brief Biography," page 90). S.M. Kirov spared no effort in consolidating the Soviet socialist state—a powerful tool for building a communist society in the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the better our factories work, the stronger and more consolidated the defense capabilities of the Soviet Union and the military strength of the socialist motherland of all working people will be.

    S.M. Kirov was a great patriot of the socialist motherland and a tireless propagandist of the Soviet state's peace-loving foreign policy. S.M. Kirov pointed out, "We pursue a policy of peace, but we will not allow anyone to mock the great country of working people" (S.M. Kirov, "Essays and Speeches," page 250). This was a serious warning to the imperialist aggressors. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union, led by the great Stalin, not only defended its freedom and independence, but also achieved a victory of world historical significance over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, thereby saving the people of the world from the threat of fascist enslavement.

    S.M. Kirov was characterized by his unbreakable confidence in the creative power of the people and in the indestructible strength of the Soviet state created by the genius of Lenin and Stalin. Uniting the working people and inspiring them to complete the tasks of socialist construction, he emphasized the great organizational and leading role of the Communist Party at all times and in all places. He educated the working masses in the spirit of boundless loyalty and love for the Party and for the great Stalin. In 1934, at the Leningrad Party Congress, S.M. Kirov said: "The image of such a great man as Stalin is truly difficult to describe... This person's majestic will, great organizational talent, enabled the Party to implement those huge historical transformations connected with the victorious construction of socialism in a timely fashion"
    (Kirov, "Essays and Speeches," page 268).

    Under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people have achieved tremendous successes in socialist economic and cultural construction, and are currently victoriously transitioning from socialism to communism. The Soviet Union has become an advanced country of culture and progress, and has become a strong fortress of peace in the world. The life and ardent activities of Sergei Mironovich Kirov, a faithful comrade-in-arms and dear friend of the great Stalin, have been dedicated to the prosperity of the world's first state of working people.

    纪念基洛夫被害十八周年
    苏联阿·德米特里叶夫
    自共产党和苏维埃国家的卓越活动家、社会主义革命的热情宣扬者和优秀的共产党员——列宁主义者谢拉盖依·米洛诺维奇·基洛夫的光辉生命被帝国主义的卑鄙无耻的托洛茨基—布哈林雇佣走狗们的毒手断送以来，已过了十八年。
    列宁和斯大林的忠实学生谢·米·基洛夫整个的一生都为劳动人民解放事业忠诚服务、为共产主义的胜利而斗争。由于具有革命群众的组织者和领袖的卓越天才，由于对人民的卑鄙敌人——托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子布哈林分子们以及对一切缺乏信心者及投降分子们进行了不调和的斗争，谢·米·基洛夫被提拔到伟大斯大林的战友队伍中来。他曾参加苏联共产党的领导核心，这一领导核心在斯大林的领导之下，保卫着列宁的伟大旗帜，把党团结在列宁遗嘱的周围，并引导苏维埃人民走向社会主义胜利建设的广阔道路。
    谢·米·基洛夫十八岁就走上了革命斗争的道路。在第一次俄国革命年代（一九○五年——一九○七年）他正在西伯利亚。他在那里热烈地开展党的活动并成为一位职业革命家。沙皇政府尽管逮捕也好，尽管几次把他关进牢狱也好，都不能摧毁这位大胆无畏的革命家——列宁主义者的意志。自一九○九年起，他在北高加索的工人和山地贫民之间进行了巨大宣传工作。在第一次世界大战年代中，谢·米·基洛夫为实现变帝国主义战争为国内战争的党的列宁口号而进行了不倦的斗争。直到伟大的十月革命前，他的全部斗争道路是和列宁、斯大林党反对沙皇制度、为推翻地主和资本家政府的英勇斗争分不开的。
    伟大十月社会主义革命胜利以后，谢·米·基洛夫贡献出自己的全部精力于巩固全世界第一个工农国家、保卫年轻的苏维埃共和国不受国内外一切敌人侵犯的事业上。在国内战争年代中，他已成为一个杰出的军事活动家和红军的政治教育家。防御邓尼金白卫匪帮和英国干涉军进攻的阿斯特拉汗英勇保卫战是和基洛夫的名字分不开的。在列宁和斯大林的领导下，谢·米·基洛夫把阿斯特拉汗变成苏维埃政权在伏尔加河口的不可进犯的前哨。谢·米·基洛夫在与维·维·库依贝舍夫和谢·奥尔忠尼启则的战斗友谊中，参加了实行粉碎邓尼金军队的天才的斯大林计划。在暂短时间内，北高加索的敌军曾被消灭干净。
    在国内战争结束后，谢·米·基洛夫对于建立和巩固在外高加索的苏维埃政权曾进行了巨大工作，他坚持不渝地和始终一贯地来实行列宁、斯大林的民族政策，从而打下了外高加索人民牢不可破的友谊和兄弟合作的基础。
    在一九二一年，第十次党代表大会上，谢·米·基洛夫被选为中央委员会候补委员，而在第十二次党代表大会上则被选为中央委员会委员。他直到死前一直被选为苏联共产党中央委员会委员，并充任政治局委员和中央委员会书记。
    在一九二一年到一九二五年，谢·米·基洛夫曾任阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会书记。
    伟大斯大林的忠实战友谢·米·基洛夫在为社会主义胜利而斗争的所有阶段上曾一贯而坚决地实行了党的总路线。
    在一九二六年，依照党的意志，谢·米·基洛夫领导了列宁格勒的党组织。这时正是苏联人民开始实行使社会主义国家工业化的宏大斯大林计划的时期，为列宁格勒决定了重要的任务——使它成为社会主义工业化的兵工厂。可是，当时反对斯大林的总方针、反对工业化的托洛茨基—季诺维也夫的投降分子们已在列宁格勒的组织中筑好了自己的巢穴。在一九二五年十二月召开的第十四次党代表大会上这些被击溃了的分子们曾继续地进行了反对党的政策的叛变和破坏工作。
    谢·米·基洛夫的刚强手腕及其为党底统一的不倦斗争帮助了列宁格勒组织，在短促时间内把托洛茨基—季诺维也夫叛党的不纯分子清除出去。在谢·米·基洛夫的领导下，列宁城的共产党员们曾越发紧密地团结在列宁、斯大林的中央委员会的周围，团结在党的领袖斯大林的周围。他们把列宁格勒变成苏联社会主义工业化的强大兵工厂。
    列宁格勒的老工人们在写给斯大林的信中说，“谢·米·基洛夫炽热于工作并以自己火样的热情燃点了别人”（一九三四年十二月三日“真理报”）。他把很多精力用在使工业部门精通于生产新式的机器、机床、涡轮机的事业上面，用在建立新工厂和使城市的设备完善上面。他对每个工人的需求都特别注意和关心，他使每个工人产生并巩固了对自己力量的信心。谢·米·基洛夫曾走在为农业社会主义改革而奋斗的战士们的最前列。在第一次斯大林五年计划年代，列宁格勒州由于农业集体化的结果，由消费的州变为苏联生产力最大的州之一。
    执行伟大斯大林的指示，谢·米·基洛夫光辉地解决了在查坡梁尔创建社会主义工业的任务。开凿了白海和波罗的海的运河，扩展了摩尔曼斯克的北方港口。谢·米·基洛夫对于文化、科学和技术一切领域的发展曾表示不断地关怀。
    赋有最大语言才能与组织者的卓越天才的基洛夫曾是马克思、列宁主义学说与列宁、斯大林思想的杰出宣传家。拥有渊博学识的马克思主义者—列宁主义者的谢·米·基洛夫和斯大林、安·亚·日丹诺夫一起，曾对新历史和苏联历史教科书纲要拟制了著名的评论。他参加了“苏联国内战争史”的编辑工作。
    谢·米·基洛夫曾以共产主义精神来教育党和青年团的干部们，号召他们经常地、创造性地来精通列宁、斯大林的学说，他像爱护眼珠一样地卫护了党的统一及其队伍的纯洁性。谢·米·基洛夫曾号召以布尔什维克的全部愤怒来和阻碍社会主义建设的一切缺点作斗争，要求不断地展开批评与自我批评。谢·米·基洛夫说，“掀起群众创造力和主动精神的巨大浪潮的自我批评，给予社会主义建设以最充沛的力量，并使它大规模地强化起来”（谢·米·基洛夫著，“略传”第九○页）。谢·米·基洛夫对于巩固苏维埃社会主义国家——在苏联建成共产主义社会的强大工具，曾不遗余力。他指示说，我们的工厂工作得越好，苏联的国防力和所有劳动人民的社会主义祖国的军事实力就会越坚实，越巩固。
    谢·米·基洛夫曾是社会主义祖国的伟大爱国者和苏维埃国家爱好和平的对外政策的不倦宣传者。谢·米·基洛夫曾指出说，“我们实行和平政策，却不许任何人嘲弄劳动人民的伟大国家”。（谢·米·基洛夫著，“论文和演说集”第二五○页）。这是对帝国主义侵略者们严重警告的一句话。在第二次世界大战中，由伟大斯大林领导的苏联，不仅是保卫住自己的自由与独立，而且获得了对法西斯德国和帝国主义日本的世界历史意义的胜利，从而把全世界人民从法西斯奴役的威胁中拯救出来。
    谢·米·基洛夫的特点就是他对人民创造力量的牢不可破的信心和对列宁和斯大林的天才所创建的苏维埃国家实力的不可摧毁的信心。团结着劳动人民并鼓舞他们来完成社会主义建设任务，他无论何时何地都着重地指出了共产党的伟大组织作用与领导作用。他曾以对党和对伟大斯大林无限忠诚与爱戴的精神教育劳动群众。在一九三四年，谢·米·基洛夫在列宁格勒党代表会议上曾说：“斯大林这样一个伟人底相貌，真是很难形容……这个人底雄伟的意志，伟大的组织才能，使党能及时实行那些与社会主义胜利建设相连的各个巨大的历史的转变”
    （基洛夫著：“论文和演说集”第二六八页）。
    苏联人民在伟大斯大林的英明领导之下，在社会主义经济与文化建设中达到了巨大成就，并且目前正胜利地实行由社会主义过渡到共产主义。苏联已成为先进的文化与进步的国家，已成为全世界强大的和平堡垒。伟大斯大林的忠实战友和亲爱的朋友——谢拉盖依·米洛诺维奇·基洛夫的一生和炽烈的活动已献给全世界第一个劳动人民国家的繁荣。
