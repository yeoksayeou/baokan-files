According to a report by correspondent Xi Rongchun: The Chuxian Branch of the China Native Produce Company in Anhui Province fraudulently reported achievements to higher authorities and obtained the "Excellent Red Flag" in the labor emulation drive in the state-owned trade system of Anhui Province, and also extravagantly "celebrated," creating a very bad influence among the local people.

On October 11th, Yin Wenqing, Deputy Manager of the Chuxian Branch of the China Native Produce Company, led the company's employees to the station to welcome the "Excellent Red Flag" issued to them by the Anhui Provincial Company of China Native Produce Company. They held the red flag, beat gongs and drums, and set off firecrackers, parading in the streets. They paraded to the entrance of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and shouted to the employees of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company: "If you Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company don't compete with us, the red flag of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce would have been ours long ago. Look! We have now won the red flag of the Provincial Company!" Spectators in the street commented: "Look at how 'burned' your native produce company is, let's see how you return the red flag when it runs away!"

That afternoon, the company issued a batch of invitation cards, which read: "We will hold a general meeting of all employees tonight to celebrate... We respectfully invite you to attend and guide; a celebratory dinner will be prepared, please be seated at 5:30 p.m. and toast to winning the Excellent Red Flag!" Among the guests who attended the celebration meeting and celebratory dinner were the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Chuxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party and Zhao Zaitian, Chief of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce.

The local people were very dissatisfied with the Chuxian Native Produce Branch's extravagant and fanfare "celebration," especially dissatisfied with the company's fraudulent acquisition of the red flag. People felt that the branch should not have received the "Excellent Red Flag" at all.

Before the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day this year, the Provincial Native Produce Company and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce had already instructed the company to prepare vermicelli, a favorite food of the local people, but the company did not prepare it, which led to a sharp rise in vermicelli prices on the market, and the masses could not buy it.

In terms of implementing price policies, the company was also perfunctory towards instructions from higher authorities. On September 22nd, the Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce notified all companies to immediately adjust wholesale and retail price differences. Grain, department store, and other companies mobilized their affiliated institutions overnight to resolutely implement the policy, but this company did not. It was not until comrades from the Provincial Department of Commerce inspecting the work raised their opinions on September 28th that they implemented it on September 29th. On September 29th, the Provincial Native Produce Company notified the adjustment of ramie prices, and the company notified its subordinates to implement it, but it did not implement it itself. It was not until the Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce discovered it on October 15th that they implemented it. On October 17th, the Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce notified the adjustment of mung bean prices, and the Grain Company implemented it as scheduled, but the company still purchased mung beans at the exchange at the original price. Private merchants questioned them, and they had to stop purchasing. The company's slipshod work style of some staff members is appalling: On November 21st, the company's Quanjiao office actually sold 135 catties of tung oil as soybean oil. Zhang Yushan Restaurant bought 10 catties to cook, and eleven people were poisoned after eating it that day, and it was only after treatment that they recovered. A female staff member named Wang Zhixia in the company's Linhuai Pass office gave birth to a child in September, and she was fired just four days before her maternity leave. The Linhuai Pass District Committee of the Communist Party criticized the office, but they still insisted on firing her. Later, the Fengyang County People's Government firmly refused to allow the dismissal, and Comrade Wang Zhixia resumed her work, but the Linhuai Pass office still refused to pay the contracted fees and production expenses during the production period. On November 28th, the East China Trade Visiting Group suggested that it be issued immediately, but they did not accept it. It was not until December 3rd that the Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce designated them to issue it immediately that it was issued.

Because the company had these serious shortcomings and mistakes in its work, the Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce did not give it an award during the evaluation and pointed out its shortcomings and mistakes. However, in its summary report to the Provincial Company, the company concealed its shortcomings and mistakes, reported only good news and not bad news. The Anhui Provincial Company of China Native Produce Company only relied on the company's summary report and did not conduct in-depth inspections before giving the "Excellent Red Flag" award, which is wrong.

Editor's note: Recently, cases of fabricating work achievements, concealing mistakes and shortcomings, and fraudulently obtaining model titles have occurred continuously in various places, which should attract our attention. The Chuxian Branch of the China Native Produce Company fraudulently obtained the "Excellent Red Flag" and extravagantly "celebrated victory," which is extremely bad. The Anhui Provincial Company of China Native Produce Company only relied on the report without investigation and gave the "Excellent Red Flag," which is also wrong and should be checked immediately and this matter re-handled. The Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Industry and Commerce was completely correct in not awarding the branch during the evaluation and pointing out its shortcomings and mistakes; however, Chief Zhao Zaitian participated in their celebration banquet "toasting to winning the Excellent Red Flag," which is perplexing. We believe that both Zhao Zaitian and the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Chuxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party should conduct a self-criticism.

    中国土产公司滁县支公司在劳动竞赛运动中
    骗取“优胜红旗”大肆“庆祝胜利”
    中国土产公司安徽省公司应重新处理这件事情
    据通讯员席荣春报道：中国土产公司滁县支公司在安徽省国营贸易系统劳动竞赛运动中，向上级假报成绩，骗取了“优胜红旗”，又铺张浪费地进行“庆祝”，在当地群众中造成很坏的影响。
    十月十一日，中国土产公司滁县支公司副经理印文卿率领着该公司的职工，到车站去迎接中国土产公司安徽省公司发给他们的“优胜红旗”。他们举着红旗，敲着锣鼓，放着鞭炮在街上游行起来。他们游行到花纱布公司门口，向花纱布公司的职工们喊道：“你们花纱布公司要不和我们争，专署工商科的红旗也早就是我们的了。看！我们现在得了省公司的红旗了！”街上的观众议论说：“看你们土产公司‘烧’成什么样了，将来红旗跑了看你们怎么送！”
    当天下午，该公司又发出了一批请帖，请帖上面写道：“特于今日晚召开全体职工大会，以资欢庆，……敬请莅会指导；另备欢庆晚宴，下午五时半入席，为荣获优胜红旗而干杯！”去参加这个欢庆大会和欢庆晚宴的来宾，有中共滁县地委宣传部部长和专署工商科的赵在田科长。
    当地群众很不满意滁县土产支公司这种铺张浪费、大吹大擂地进行“庆祝”的作法，尤其不满意该公司骗取红旗的行为。人们觉得该支公司根本不应该得到“优胜红旗”。
    在今年中秋节和国庆节以前，省土产公司和滁县专署工商科早就指示该公司准备当地人民所喜欢吃的粉丝，但该公司并没有准备，以致市场上粉丝价格大涨，群众还买不到。
    在执行价格政策方面，该公司对于上级指示也是马马虎虎的。九月二十二日，滁县专署工商科通知各公司立即调整批发、零售差价，粮食、百货等公司都连夜动员所属机构坚决执行，但该公司却不执行。直到九月二十八日省商业厅检查工作的同志提出意见，他们才在二十九日执行。九月二十九日，省土产公司通知调整苎麻价格，该公司通知下级执行，但自己却不执行。直到十月十五日滁县专署工商科发觉，他们才执行了。十月十七日，滁县专署工商科通知调整绿豆牌价，粮食公司如期执行了，该公司却仍按原来的牌价在交易所收购绿豆，私商向他们提出质问，他们只好停止收购。该公司的某些工作人员的粗枝大叶的作风是很惊人的：十一月二十一日，该公司全椒办事处竟将一百三十五斤桐油当作豆油卖了。张玉山饭店买了十斤去作菜，当天就有十一个人吃后中毒，经救治后才算好了。该公司临淮关办事处有一个女工作人员叫王芝霞，在九月间生了孩子，产前四天才休息，刚刚休息就被解雇了。中共临淮关区委批评了该办事处，但他们仍然坚持要解雇。后来凤阳县人民政府坚决不准解雇，王芝霞同志才恢复了工作，但生产期间的包干费和生产费，临淮关办事处仍拒不发给。十一月二十八日华东贸易访问团建议立即发给，他们也不接受。直到十二月三日滁县专署工商科指定他们立即发给，才算发了。
    因为该公司在工作中有这些严重的缺点和错误，所以滁县专署工商科在评奖时没有给予奖励，并且指出了他们的缺点和错误。但该公司在给省公司的总结报告中，掩盖缺点和错误，报喜不报忧，中国土产公司安徽省公司只凭该公司的总结报告，没有深入检查，就给予“优胜红旗”的奖励，这是不对的。
    编者按：最近各地连续发生捏造工作成绩，掩盖错误和缺点，骗取模范称号的事情，应该引起我们的注意。中国土产公司滁县支公司骗取“优胜红旗”，并铺张浪费，大肆“庆祝胜利”，恶劣不堪。中国土产公司安徽省公司只凭报告，不去调查，就给予“优胜红旗”，也是错误的，应该立即加以检查，重新处理这件事情。滁县专署工商科在评奖当中对该支公司不予奖励，并且指出他们的缺点和错误，这是完全正确的；但科长赵在田又参加了他们“为荣获优胜红旗而干杯”的庆祝宴会，这就使人莫名其妙了。我们认为赵在田和中共滁县地委宣传部部长都应该进行检讨。
