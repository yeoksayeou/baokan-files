    "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" Performed in Romania
    Liang Hanguang

    Editor's Note: The author of this article is the composer of the opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." He was invited to Romania in the autumn of this year to assist in the production of the opera. December 30th is the 5th anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic, and he has written this article to celebrate the achievements of Romanian culture and art.

    Our new opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," after more than a year of rehearsal and preparation by the Timisoara National Opera House of Romania, was officially performed at the theater on October 5th this year, and a grand opening ceremony was held. According to the theater's plan, it will be widely performed in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, and other major cities next spring.

    This performance was very successful. It has made a great contribution to strengthening cultural exchanges between the people of China and Romania. This performance enabled the Romanian people to understand the heroic image of the Chinese people in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, and to understand the living conditions and artistic characteristics of the Chinese people. More importantly, this performance has brought the hearts of the two peoples closer together. In the Romanian people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, countless similar heroic deeds have also emerged.

    From the performance of "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," we can see the outstanding achievements of Romanian opera art. The singing and performance of the actors all showed extremely high accomplishment. The actors' voices were so loud that the singing reached the last row of the audience. This would not be possible without long-term hard practice. Although this opera describes the reality of the Chinese people's struggle, and it is the first time that a Chinese opera has been performed in Romania, the working people of the world are one family. They correctly grasped the fighting emotions of the working people and the characteristics of Chinese art, and successfully reflected the heroic images of Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang and the ugly faces of the landlords to the audience.

    The direction was also unusually successful. Some places particularly prominently displayed the creativity of Romanian artists. In the second scene of the fourth act, at the banquet where Cui Erye (Cui Yanwang) forcibly marries Li Xiangxiang, four tables of wine and food were used to entertain the Kuomintang company commanders, platoon leaders, and landlord relatives who kill without blinking an eye. Cui Yanwang and these guys shook their heads and wagged their tails there, showing the utmost ugliness in the world; backstage was also noisy, with Kuomintang soldiers gambling and making a lot of noise; villagers were forced to serve them wine and carry food. This not only enriched the expressiveness of the plot, but also aroused great resentment from the audience. Some of the masses who served them wine and carried food later served as internal support in the struggle to liberate Siyangwan. In addition, when Siyangwan was liberated and Cui Yanwang was captured, the joyful mood of the masses reached its peak. The joyous celebration dance lasted for twenty minutes, interspersed with Yangko dance, military dance, and the red silk dance at the back, which further emphasized the significance of the liberation of Siyangwan and prominently depicted the joyful emotions of the people. When the dance reached its climax and stopped, the proposal of Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang's marriage strengthened the meaning of the theme: without revolution, without the liberation of the people, there would be no such happy marriage. Finally, after the wedding chorus, a portrait of Chairman Mao was held high on the stage, ending the play in a scene of infinite excitement, enthusiasm, and dazzling brilliance. From these successful treatments and performances, we can see Romania's high achievements in operatic art. Other aspects such as stage design, orchestra, and costume design all showed rich creativity. Now they are making further revisions, strengthening the heroic depiction of the positive characters, and strengthening the tightness of the rhythm and movement of the whole play, so that it can be better performed in major cities next year.

    Just on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic, as a close friend of the Romanian art world, I would like to wish the Romanian culture and art success, and congratulate the deepening of the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people and the further development of cultural exchanges.

    “王贵与李香香”在罗马尼亚的演出
    梁寒光
    编者按：本文作者是歌剧“王贵与李香香”的作曲者，曾于本年秋季应邀赴罗马尼亚辅导这个歌剧的演出工作。十二月三十日是罗马尼亚人民共和国成立五周年纪念日，他特写此文，庆祝罗马尼亚文化艺术的成就。
    我国新歌剧“王贵与李香香”由罗马尼亚底密索拉国家歌剧院经过一年多的排练准备之后，于今年十月五日在该剧院正式演出，并举行隆重的开幕仪式。根据该剧院的计划，明春将在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特及各主要城市广泛演出。
    这次演出是十分成功的。这对加强中罗两国人民间的文化交流有很大的贡献。这次演出使罗马尼亚人民了解中国人民在反帝反封建斗争中的英雄形象，了解中国人民的生活状况和艺术特点。更重要的是通过这次演出，使两国人民的心更紧密地维系在一起了。在罗马尼亚人民的反帝反封建斗争中，也涌现了无数相似的英雄事迹。
    从“王贵与李香香”的演出中，可以看到罗马尼亚歌剧艺术的卓越成就。演员的歌唱和表演都表现了极高的修养。演员的嗓音是那样宏亮，歌声传达到最后一排观众。如果没有经过长期的苦练，是不可能做到这一点的。这部歌剧虽然是描述中国人民的斗争现实，而且在罗马尼亚还是第一次演出中国的歌剧，但世界劳动人民是一家，他们正确地把握劳动人民的斗争情绪和中国艺术的特点，成功地把王贵与李香香的英雄形象和地主的丑恶面貌生动地反映在观众面前。
    在导演的作业上也是异常成功的。其中有些地方特别突出地显示了罗马尼亚艺术家的创造力。在第四幕第二场崔二爷（崔阎王）强娶李香香的宴会上，用四桌酒席招待那些杀人不眨眼的国民党的连长、排长和地主的亲友。崔阎王和这些家伙在那里摇头晃脑，极尽人间的丑恶；后台也是喧喧嚷嚷，国民党的士兵在那里猜拳赌博闹翻天；强迫村民为他们端酒扛菜。这不仅丰富了情节的表现力，而且引起了观众的极大忿恨。有些为他们端酒扛菜的群众，在后来解放死羊湾的斗争中担任了内应工作。另外，当死羊湾解放、捉住了崔阎王之后，群众的欢欣鼓舞情绪达到了顶点，欢天喜地的庆祝舞蹈，长达二十分钟，用秧歌舞、军人舞和后面的红绸舞等间杂着，这样就更强调了死羊湾解放的意义，突出地描写了人民欢乐的情绪。当舞蹈进行到顶点而停止下来的时候，再提出王贵与李香香结婚，这就加强了主题的意义：没有革命，没有人民的解放，就没有这样美满的婚姻。最后，在结婚合唱曲之后，把毛主席像高举在舞台之上，在无限兴奋热烈和光华夺目的情景下结束全剧。从这些成功的处理和表演看来，可以看到罗马尼亚在歌剧艺术上的高度成就。其他如舞台设计、乐队和服装设计等，都表现了丰富的创造力。现在他们正在作进一步的修整、加强正面人物的英雄主义的描绘，加强全剧节奏运动的紧密性，以便明年更好地在各大城市演出。
    正当罗马尼亚人民共和国成立五周年纪念之际，我作为罗马尼亚艺术界的亲密的朋友，谨祝罗马尼亚文化艺术的成就，并祝贺中罗两国人民友谊的加深和文化交流的更进一步的发展。
