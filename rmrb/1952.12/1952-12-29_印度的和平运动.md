    India's Peace Movement
    Gopalan, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India
    Member of the Indian Parliament

    The Indian people have a noble and long-standing tradition of loving peace. Except for suffering aggression or being dragged into wars by the British, India has never fought with other countries. While fighting for our own independence, our people have constantly supported the struggles of all oppressed people against their oppressors. At the same time, we have continuously drawn inspiration from the heroic actions of liberation movements in various countries.

    We also never forget the importance of internationalist solidarity and mutual assistance. Our actions in sending medical teams to China, boycotting Japanese goods, supporting the Spanish people, and supporting the people of Abyssinia and Indonesia in their struggles against foreign aggressors are all proud records in our history.

    Although India was not directly involved in the war, it suffered all kinds of terrible effects of the war. It is well known that India relies on imported grain. During the last World War, due to the cut-off of foreign grain supplies, the Great Bengal Famine in 1943 killed more than three million people. Today, we still need to import more than five million tons of grain.

    We need to obtain cheap grain from other countries, and we need convenient conditions for transporting grain to our country. If we cannot guarantee the supply of grain or facilitate transportation, a famine even worse than the one in 1943 will be unavoidable. The outbreak of another war would mean that millions of people in India would die simply due to lack of food. This is the fundamental reason why the Indian people have such a strong interest in maintaining peace. Moreover, the Indian people have increasingly realized that in the current world situation, once a world war breaks out, no country can remain aloof.

    Since the outbreak of the Korean War, prices have risen and unemployment has increased. Famine is spreading rapidly in India, while at the same time, 52 percent of the budget is still allocated to defense spending, with only one percent allocated to education, and even less to healthcare. While India is suffering from hunger, it is desperately using the threat of war as an excuse for huge military expenditures. Imperialists, through their tools, are trying to infect us with a war psychosis, and they cunningly use the India-Pakistan and Kashmir issues to incite this sentiment.

    Faced with these problems, the Indian people have launched a powerful peace movement, becoming part of the world peace movement. This movement began with the support of intellectuals and has now expanded to a wider section of our people. Provincial and district peace committees have been established. Under the leadership of the All-India Peace Council, the Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign was launched, and many rallies and demonstrations were held. Korean Day and Tunisia Day were emphasized throughout the country. Thousands of people participated in these gatherings.

    The All-India Peace Council issued thousands of appeals to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and this document was endorsed by mass rallies attended by large numbers of people throughout India. The appeal stated: "We present this appeal to you at a time when all humanity is troubled by recent events that have seriously deteriorated international relations. The Korean armistice talks are encountering obstacles in seeking an agreement; inhuman war methods and weapons have been used; increasingly cruel atrocities have been taken to suppress colonial peoples who firmly believe they have the right to decide their own destiny; the decision to rearm Germany and Japan has caused tense situations; the Atlantic bloc is being strengthened as a tool of war; the people continue to suffer enslavement."

    Two million of our people have signed the appeal, urging the Indian government to initiate a conference of the five major powers. In the provincial legislative assemblies and the People's House of Parliament, motions were introduced and speeches were made in support of this appeal by the Indian people.

    The masses of the Indian people expressed great anger at the United States' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea. Protest rallies were held throughout India, and resolutions were passed to Nehru. These resolutions stated: "You are aware of the Korean and Chinese governments' condemnation of the United States' use of bacteriological bombs in Korea and China. These condemnations have been confirmed by some independent witnesses. Members of our own delegation to China recently stated that they believed that the American army was conducting bacteriological warfare.

    "We believe that in order to promote the implementation of the ban on bacteriological weapons, the Indian government could send an independent investigation team composed of members of various parties, doctors, scientists, lawyers, and religious figures to investigate the affected areas and make their findings public. Doing so would be of great value to the cause of peace."

    Local peace committees conducted extensive propaganda and organized many mass demonstrations, expressing that under no circumstances would they tolerate imperialist countries using Indian territory or resources for aggression, even indirectly.

    The issue of allowing the British to recruit Gurkhas within India to suppress the liberation struggle of the Malayan people has drawn the attention of the Indian people. The demand to withdraw the Gurkha soldiers from the British army fighting in Malaya has been raised, and this demand is so strong that even the Prime Minister of Nepal has announced that he opposes the use of Gurkha soldiers in Malaya.

    On the eve of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, peace conferences attended by thousands of people were held in Madras, Bombay, East Punjab, Andhra, Kerala, and other places. The peace rally held in Madras was attended by more than 50,000 people.

    The delegation to Beijing to attend the Peace Conference was one of the strongest delegations ever sent by the Indian people. The delegates came from all parts of India, representing various parties and groups, including people from all walks of life. This is sufficient to show that the peace movement has taken deep roots in the land of India. These delegates, inspired by the Peace Conference held in Beijing, will return to their respective provinces to further expand the peace movement.

    The Indian people play a very important role in the cause of defending peace, and a great responsibility falls on the shoulders of Indian peace fighters.

    For example, on the Korean issue, if India adopts a firm position and insists on resolving the dispute over the repatriation of prisoners on the basis of recognized international law, India's voice will unite honest men and women in various countries, so that peace talks can no longer be delayed.

    For example, in protesting the atrocities committed under the name of the United Nations, if India declares that it will decisively break away from all United Nations actions in Korea, it will have a moral impact and be able to play a decisive role.

    Since the Indian peace movement has been able to prevent the British government from recruiting Gurkha soldiers on Indian soil and has been able to prevent French airplanes and ships from passing through India to transport war materials and soldiers to Vietnam, we will certainly be able to inflict a serious blow on the forces of war again.

    The people of India and Pakistan have begun to see the sinister hand of foreign imperialists behind many "disputes." These include the Kashmir issue. If the peace movements in the two countries can stop foreign interference and agree to resolve all disputes through consultation, they will be guaranteed to achieve a major victory. Therefore, the joint statement on the Kashmir issue by the Indian and Pakistani delegations attending the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference is of great significance.

    I firmly believe that the Peace Conference held in Beijing will play a great role in strengthening the Indian peace movement. Now the Indian peace movement will develop on a broad mass basis and will promote the government to take a clear position on war and warmongers. The People's Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong is a great encouragement to the Indian peace movement. Inspired by the historic words of Comrade Stalin, Indian peace fighters will resolutely shoulder the cause of defending peace. Together with the Soviet people and the Chinese people, the Indian people can unite the people of the world to strive for lasting peace.

    印度的和平运动
    印度共产党中央委员会委员
    印度国会议员  高普兰
    印度人民具有崇高和悠久的爱好和平的传统。除了遭受侵略或者被英国人拖进战争，印度从来没有和别的国家打过仗。在为争取自己的独立而斗争的同时，我们的人民曾经不断支援一切被压迫人民反对压迫者的斗争。我们同时不断从各国解放运动的英勇行动中获得鼓舞。
    我们也从来不会忘记国际主义的团结与互助的重要性。我们派遣医疗队到中国，抵制日本货，支援西班牙人民的行动，支援阿比西尼亚和印度尼西亚人民反对外国侵略者的斗争，都是我们历史上可以骄傲的纪录。
    印度虽然没有直接卷入战争，但是却受过可怕的战争的各种影响。人所共知，印度是要依靠输入的粮食的。在上次世界大战中由于断绝了外国粮食的供应，一九四三年孟加拉省大饥荒便死了三百多万人。今天我们还要输入五百万吨以上的谷物。
    我们需要从其他国家获得廉价的粮食，我们需要运输谷物到我国的便利条件。如果我们不能够保证粮食或者运输的便利，将难免发生比一九四三年还厉害的饥荒。另外一次战争的爆发，将意味着印度有好几百万人会单纯因为缺乏食物而死亡。这就是为什么印度人民对于维护和平的兴趣如此浓厚的根本原因。况且，印度人民已日益明白，在现在的世界形势中，一旦世界战争爆发，任何一个国家都不可能置身事外的。
    自从朝鲜战争发生以后，物价上涨，失业增加。印度的饥荒迅速蔓延，而同时预算中仍然以百分之五十二拨作国防费用，只有百分之一用于教育，甚至更少的数目用于保健事业。印度挨受着饥饿的时候，却极力以战争威胁作为庞大军费开支的藉口。帝国主义者通过他们的工具企图使我们患着战争狂的精神病，他们狡猾地利用印度—巴基斯坦和克什米尔问题来煽动这种情绪。
    面对着这些问题，印度人民已发动起一个强大的和平运动，成为世界和平运动的一部分。这个运动开始的时候得到知识分子的拥护，现在已扩展到我们人民中更广泛的阶层了。省和区的和平委员会已建立起来。在全印和平理事会的领导下，展开了征集斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动，举行过许多集会和示威。朝鲜日和突尼斯日在全国各地受到重视。好几千人参加了这些集会。
    全印和平理事会印发了好几千份给印度总理尼赫鲁的呼吁书，这个文件获得印度各地广大人民参加的群众大会的拥护。呼吁书中说到：“我们呈递给你这一份呼吁书，是正值全人类被最近一些使国际关系严重恶化的事件所困扰的时候。朝鲜停战谈判在觅取协议的途中遭受障碍；违反人道的战争手段和武器已被使用；愈来愈残酷的暴行被采取来镇压坚信有权决定自己命运的殖民地人民；重新武装德国和日本的决定引起紧张的局势；大西洋集团被加强作为战争的工具；人民继续遭受奴役。”
    我们二百万人民已在呼吁书上签名，敦促印度政府发起召开五大国会议。在省立法议会和国会人民院中，有人提出议案和发表演说赞成印度人民这个呼吁书。
    印度的人民群众对于美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器表示极大的愤怒。在印度各地都举行了抗议集会，并通过给尼赫鲁的决议。这些决议中说：“你是知道朝鲜和中国政府对美国在朝鲜和中国使用细菌弹的谴责的。这些谴责已被一些独立的目击者所证实了。我们自己到中国去的代表团团员最近也表示他们相信美国军队在进行细菌战。
    “我们认为，为了促成实行禁用细菌武器，印度政府可以派遣一个由各党派的议员、医生、科学家、律师和宗教界人士组成的独立性的调查团，去受害区考察，把他们的发现公之于世。这样做对于和平事业有莫大的价值。”
    各地和平委员会进行了广泛的宣传，并组织了许多群众性示威，表示他们在任何情况下都不能容忍帝国主义国家利用印度的领土或资源进行侵略，即使是间接的利用。
    允许英国人在印度国境内招募廓尔喀人去镇压马来亚人民的解放斗争的问题，引起了印度人民的重视。把在马来亚作战的英国军队中的廓尔喀兵撤回的要求已被提出来，这种要求是如此的强烈，甚至尼泊尔的总理也要宣布他是反对在马来亚使用廓尔喀兵的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开的前夕，在马德拉斯、孟买、东旁遮普、安德拉、喀拉拉和其他地方都举行了好几千人参加的和平大会。在马德拉斯举行的和平集会有五万以上的人参加。
    到北京来出席和平会议的代表团是印度人民所曾派遣的最强大的一个代表团。代表团的团员来自印度各地，代表了各个党派和团体，包括了各界人士。这足以表明和平运动已在印度的土地上扎下了深根。这些代表们得到了在北京举行的和平会议的鼓舞，将回到他们各自的省份去，进一步扩大和平运动。
    印度人民在保卫和平事业中担任着很重要的角色，重大的责任落在印度和平战士的身上。
    例如在朝鲜问题上，假若印度采取坚定的立场，坚持在公认的国际法的基础上解决遣返俘虏的争论，印度的呼声便将会团结各国诚实的男女，使和平谈判可以不再继续拖延下去。
    又如抗议在联合国名义下进行的暴行，假若印度声明断然与在朝鲜的联合国一切行动一刀两断，将会有道义上的影响，而能够发生决定性的作用。
    印度的和平运动既然能够制止英国政府在印度国土上招募廓尔喀兵，能够阻止法国的飞机和船只经过印度运送战争物资和士兵去越南，我们一定能够再予战争力量以严重的打击。
    印度和巴基斯坦的人民已开始看到外国帝国主义者在许多“纷争”问题背后的魔手。其中包括克什米尔问题。两国的和平运动如果能够制止外国的干涉，同意用协商的方式来解决一切争端，将保证能获得重大胜利。因此出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印度和巴基斯坦代表团关于克什米尔问题的联合声明是有重大意义的。
    我深信在北京举行的和平会议对于加强印度和平运动有很大的作用，现在印度的和平运动将在一个广大的群众基础上向前发展，并会促使政府对于战争和战争制造者采取明确的立场。在毛泽东主席领导下的中华人民共和国对于印度的和平运动是一个很大的鼓舞。印度的和平战士受到斯大林同志的历史性的言辞所鼓舞，将坚决把保卫和平事业担当起来。印度人民和苏联人民与中国人民在一起，便可以团结全世界的人民争取永久的和平。
