    Fuxin Mining Bureau Exceeds This Year's Basic Construction Plan
    By the end of this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau will have completed 101.1% of the state's basic construction plan. Drilling and the Ping'an Shaft project have already exceeded their targets. The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine and the Xinqiu East Open-Pit Mine are also expected to exceed their targets.
    The Fuxin Mining Bureau had a very large basic construction task this year. The state's investment was more than four and a half times that of last year, including open-pit mines, shafts, hydraulic filling, and the installation of large mercury rectifiers, all of which we were completely unfamiliar with. Despite the heavy workload and lack of experience, the Fuxin Mining Bureau was able to exceed the state's targets, mainly because:
    First, the leadership of the Fuxin Mining Bureau conscientiously implemented the instruction issued by the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry this spring on strengthening basic construction, and truly placed basic construction in a primary position. In order to strengthen basic construction, this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau transferred 2,204 outstanding workers from the production departments to strengthen the basic construction organizations. At the same time, following the principle of basic construction first, production second, it guaranteed the supply of materials for basic construction. When basic construction work encountered difficulties or deviations, the leadership promptly put forward slogans to guide the direction, enabling the work to continue to advance on the existing basis. In May of this year, all mine workers enthusiastically responded to the call for "increasing production and practicing economy" and launched a May production competition. However, later there was a deviation of simply pursuing quantity and neglecting engineering quality. According to the instructions of the higher-level leading organs, the leadership carried out "quality make-up lessons" to ensure the quality of the project. At the beginning of the third quarter, accidents occurred frequently in the project. The leadership promptly mobilized the masses to conduct a "major safety inspection" and established a safety responsibility system, which greatly reduced accidents. On this basis, challenges and responses were widely launched among the workers, so that the progress of basic construction completed in September increased by 104% compared with July and 109% compared with August. Due to the importance attached by the leadership, all the workers also recognized the importance of basic construction and strongly supported the basic construction work under the slogan of "serving construction." The Ping'an Mine promptly assisted in solving the repair problem in the mine's eight-pit hydraulic filling project, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the project.
    Second, timely and adequate preparation work is one of the important factors for the Fuxin Mining Bureau to exceed its targets. Preparation for basic construction in 1952 began in August last year. In August last year, the Bureau overcame the mentality of passively waiting, and divided the project items into four categories: most important, important, secondary, and least important, and carried out preparation work step by step and in a planned manner. Detailed surveys and preliminary designs were carried out for the most important and important projects. As soon as the plan was finalized, a specific plan was formulated and a technical design was carried out. Because this year's project was complex, the Bureau also sent a large number of technicians and skilled workers to the Xi'an Mining Bureau to learn shaft construction technology, and to the Fushun Mining Bureau to learn the installation method of mercury rectifiers, and vigorously carried out winter training of workers. The timely supply of materials and equipment is one of the important conditions to ensure the completion of the task. At the beginning of this year, when the "Three-Anti" movement was still in full swing, the Bureau took the initiative to grasp the ordering work, check the inventory in the warehouse, and transfer some equipment from production. In the material supply work, the Bureau implemented a special responsibility system of "guaranteed ordering, guaranteed transportation, and guaranteed urging," so that there were no more work stoppages due to waiting for materials in this year's project.
    Third, the mass line was conscientiously implemented in basic construction work. The annual, quarterly, and even each project's construction plan of the Fuxin Mining Bureau have been widely and deeply studied and discussed by the workers and masses, and plans for 220 groups have been formulated. In this way, from the leadership to the construction units and the masses, everyone "knows the numbers" for this year's tasks. At the beginning of each quarter, the Bureau also holds an enlarged construction meeting, which is attended by the Bureau's director, deputy director, responsible persons of relevant units, and representatives of workers at the construction site to discuss and solve various difficulties and problems in the construction. The leadership of the Bureau also mobilized the masses to formulate collective contracts, contact contracts, and mentor-apprentice contracts, so that the work between work types, leadership and the masses, agencies and the field, and the field and material supply units, were closely coordinated into an organic whole, working together to complete the state plan.
    Fourth, a special responsibility system was established to correct the phenomenon of no one being responsible. There was a fairly serious phenomenon of no one being responsible in the basic construction project of the Fuxin Mining Bureau. This year, the Bureau, according to the instructions of the higher authorities, mobilized the masses to expose 2,758 cases of no one being responsible. On this basis, a special responsibility system was established, which closely linked the upper and lower levels and the various units, and achieved timely discovery and resolution of problems.
    Fifth, the promotion of advanced experience is the basic method to complete the task. The Fuxin Mining Bureau has promoted more than 20 kinds of advanced experience through learning, training, technical appraisal, propaganda performance, specific help, and rewards. In terms of drilling, the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi group was promoted. From January to mid-August this year, 7,040 meters of casing and 2,000 man-days were saved, and the state task was completed one quarter ahead of schedule. In terms of open-pit engineering, the fixed-point operation method was promoted in the stripping work, and the daily stripping volume increased from 17,500 cubic meters to 32,000 cubic meters. In terms of civil engineering and construction, the bricklaying methods of Su Changyou, Gao Kaifu, and Zhong Zhixian were promoted, and the efficiency increased from 1,877 bricks per man-day to 4,481 bricks.

    阜新矿务局超额完成今年基本建设计划
    阜新矿务局今年的基本建设计划，到年底可完成国家计划的百分之一百零一点一。钻探及平安竖井工程已超额完成任务。海州大露天矿和新邱东露天矿也都可超额完成任务。
    阜新矿务局今年的基本建设任务是很大的，国家投资超过去年的四倍半，其中并有我们完全不熟悉的露天矿，竖井、水砂充填及大型水银整流器的安装工程。在任务繁重、经验不足的情况下，阜新矿务局所以能超额完成国家任务，主要原因是：
    第一，阜新矿务局的领导方面认真贯彻了东北人民政府工业部在今年春季发出的关于加强基本建设的指示，真正把基本建设放在首要地位。为了加强基本建设，今年，阜新矿务局曾从生产部门抽调出优秀职工二千二百零四人，充实基本建设机构，同时，在先基本建设后生产的原则下，保证了基本建设方面的材料供应。在基本建设工作遇到困难或发生偏差的时候，领导方面及时提出口号指示方向，使工作在既有的基础上得以不断前进。今年五月，全矿工人热烈响应了“增产节约”号召，发动了五月生产大竞赛。但后来又发生了单纯追求数量，忽视工程质量的偏差。领导方面根据上级领导机关的指示，进行了“质量补课”，保证了工程质量。第三季度开始时，工程屡屡发生事故，领导方面及时地发动群众进行“安全大检查”，建立了安全责任制度，事故大大减少。在这个基础上，职工中普遍展开了挑战与应战，使九月份完成基本建设的进度较七月份增加了百分之一百零四，较八月份增加百分之一百零九。由于领导方面的重视，全体职工也都认识到基本建设的重要意义，在“为建设服务”的口号下，大力支持了基本建设工作。平安矿及时协助解决了该矿八坑水砂充填工程中的修理问题，因而保证了工程的顺利进行。
    第二，及时而充分的准备工作，是阜新矿务局超额完成任务的重要因素之一。一九五二年基本建设的准备工作，在去年八月就已开始进行。去年八月该局克服了消极等待思想，把工程项目分别为最主要、主要、次要、最次要四类，有步骤有计划地进行准备工作。对最主要和主要的工程都进行了详细的勘察和初步设计，一俟计划最后确定，即编制具体计划并进行技术设计。因为今年的工程复杂，该局事先还派出大批技术人员和技术工人到西安矿务局学习建设竖井技术，到抚顺矿务局学习水银整流器的安装法，并大力进行冬季培养训练工人的工作。材料设备的及时供应是保证完成任务的重要条件之一，该局在今年初“三反”运动还在紧张进行时，就主动地抓紧进行了订货工作，检查仓库中的存货，由生产中调拨一部分器材。在材料供应工作中，该局实行了“包订包运包催”的专责制度，使今年的工程中不再发生停工待料现象。
    第三，在基本建设工作中认真贯彻了群众路线。阜新矿务局的年度、季度、以至每项工程的施工计划，都经过职工群众广泛深入地研究和讨论，订出了二百二十个小组的计划。这样，从领导方面到施工单位以及群众，对今年的任务都做到了“心中有数”。每季度开始时，该局还召开施工扩大会议，由局长、副局长召集有关单位负责人及工地工人代表等参加，讨论解决施工中的各种困难问题。该局领导方面还发动群众，订立了集体合同、联系合同、师徒合同等，使工种间、领导与群众、机关与现场、现场与器材供应单位，都密切配合为一个有机的整体，共同为完成国家计划而努力。
    第四，建立专责制度，纠正无人负责现象。阜新矿务局的基本建设工程中原来存在着相当严重的无人负责现象。今年该局曾根据上级指示，发动群众揭发了二千七百五十八件无人负责现象，在这个基础上，建立了专责制度，密切了上下级间与各单位间的联系，做到了及时发现与解决问题。
    第五，推广先进经验是完成任务的基本方法。阜新矿务局通过了学习、训练、技术鉴定、宣传表演、具体帮助、奖励等方法方式，先后推广了二十多种先进经验。在钻探方面，推广了马文志小组的先进经验，今年一月至八月中，节省了套管七千零四十公尺及二千人工，且提前一季完成了国家任务；露天工程方面，在剥离工作中推广了定点作业法，每日剥离量由一万七千五百立方公尺提高到三万二千立方公尺；土木建筑方面，推广苏长有、高开福、仲志先的砌砖法，效率由每工一千八百七十七块增加到四千四百八十一块。
