    Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering "Crash Program" Ends Successfully

    The "Crash Program" (Qiang Gong) for construction projects in Beijing has concluded successfully, and winter construction projects are now underway with a focus on key areas.

    During the 45-day "Crash Program," over 200,000 square meters of construction were completed without any accidents, and the quality generally met standards. This success was primarily due to the leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, the cooperation of relevant departments, and the joint efforts of all workers, technicians, and management cadres of the Beijing Construction Company. At the beginning of the "Crash Program," leading cadres of the Beijing Construction Company conducted thorough mobilization, ensuring that all employees understood the significance of the "Crash Program." A "Crash Program Headquarters" was established to uniformly lead the movement. Throughout the "Crash Program," calls were made for each construction site to pay attention to safe production, ensuring no casualties; to promote advanced experiences and pay attention to project quality; to strengthen planning and close coordination with material supply; and to make preparations for frost prevention. Therefore, during the project's execution, all employees actively sought "tricks" and offered ideas under the slogan of "facing the construction site and doing everything to complete the 'Crash Program' tasks," striving to complete projects ahead of schedule. The Fifth Engineering Division, in order to overcome work stoppages and waiting for work, organized 26 shock brigades comprised of various trades to assist construction sites that had materials but lacked labor, thereby increasing production efficiency by 30%. Learning and promoting advanced production experience ensured the victory of the "Crash Program." For example, the Apple Orchard construction site in Shijingshan completed a 100-day task 32 days ahead of schedule by promoting parallel assembly line operations, saving approximately 4 billion yuan in labor and material costs. The Xizhao Temple construction site of the Seventh Engineering Division implemented this advanced method, completing the project 15 days ahead of schedule and saving the country over 330 million yuan in wealth. Workers at many construction sites, by using advanced production tools, created many new records. For example, in bricklaying, the average number of bricks laid per person per day increased from over 500 to around 1,000. The Sun Quansheng advanced bricklaying team of the Second Engineering Division even created a new record of averaging 2,800 bricks laid per person per day.

    This "Crash Program" was conducted with leadership and planning. Before the "Crash Program," the Beijing Construction Company made thorough preparations, categorizing all projects into four types: must-complete, key "Crash Program," maintain existing progress, and halt construction. Then, it concentrated its efforts on projects that had to be completed, carrying out "simultaneous" construction. During the "Crash Program," ensuring material supply and transportation was an extremely important issue. In the early stages of the "Crash Program," Beijing experienced instances of work stoppages due to waiting for materials, mainly because: 1. Insufficient transportation capacity and improper organization and allocation prevented materials from being delivered in a timely manner; 2. Owners could not supply materials in a timely manner; 3. Some special materials were temporarily unavailable for purchase and transportation, etc. However, thanks to the efforts of the Beijing Construction Company and the employees of each engineering division, various methods were adopted to overcome difficulties and ensure the completion of transportation tasks. The Fourth Engineering Division proactively supplied materials according to the material supply plans submitted by the construction sites, distinguishing between priorities and urgency. The First Engineering Division organized pushcarts to participate in material supply work, solving the problem of insufficient transportation capacity. In addition, some engineering divisions negotiated with the sellers to have materials delivered to the construction sites; some engineering divisions organized their own transportation teams to be responsible for supply work. In this regard, the transportation department and other relevant units also did much work, powerfully cooperating with the "Crash Program."

    Now, Beijing's construction projects, except for winter construction projects being carried out with a focus on key areas, have all concluded. The Beijing Construction Company and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Construction Workers' Union are fully engaged in summarizing experiences and preparing for winter training for workers and cadres.

### 北京市建筑工程“抢工”运动胜利结束

     北京市建筑工程“抢工”运动胜利结束
    【新华社十日讯】北京市建筑工程的“抢工”运动已胜利结束，现正有重点地进行冬季施工工程。
    这次“抢工”运动，在四十五天内完成了二十余万平方公尺的工程，没有发生事故，质量一般够标准。这主要是因为北京市人民政府财政经济委员会的领导和各有关部门的配合，以及北京市建筑公司全体工人、技术人员和管理干部的共同努力。在“抢工”运动开始，北京市建筑公司领导干部首先进行了充分的动员，使全体职工了解“抢工”的意义，并成立了“抢工指挥部”，统一领导这个运动。在“抢工”中又号召各工地注意安全生产，保障各工地不发生伤亡事故；推广先进经验，注意工程质量；加强计划性与材料供应的密切配合；做好防冻准备。因此工程进行中，全体职工在面向工地，一切为了完成“抢工”任务的口号下，积极找“窍门”，出主意，用一切办法争取提前完工。第五工程处为了克服窝工、等工现象，组织了二十六个包括有各种工种的突击队，到有料无工的工地去协助“抢工”，因而提高生产效率百分之三十。学习与推广先进生产经验，保证了“抢工”运动的胜利。如石景山苹果园工地由于推广了平行流水作业法，一百天的任务，提前三十二天完工，并节省了工料费约四十多亿元。第七工程处夕照寺工地，实行了这个先进方法，提前十五天完工，为国家节约了三亿三千多万元的财富。不少工地的工人，由于使用了先进生产工具，创造了不少新纪录。例如砌砖，每人每天由平均砌五百多块提高到平均一千块左右。第二工程处孙全盛瓦工先进小组，更创造了每人每天平均砌两千八百块的新纪录。
    这次“抢工”运动是有领导有计划地进行的。在“抢工”前，北京市建筑公司，进行了充分准备，把所有工程排了队，分成：必须完成、重点“抢工”、维持原有进度和停止施工等四类。而后集中力量，对必须完成的工程，进行“齐头并进”的施工。在“抢工”过程中，保证材料供应和运输是个极其重要的问题。“抢工”开始的初期，北京市曾经发生过停工待料的现象，主要是因为：一、运输力不足以及组织调配不当，不能将材料及时运到；二、业主不能及时供应材料；三、有些特殊材料，一时购买和运输不及等等。但由于北京市建筑公司和各工程处职工的努力，采取各种方法，克服困难，保证了运输任务的完成。第四工程处采用主动的按工地送来的材料供应计划，分别轻重缓急，提前供应。第一工程处组织排子车参加材料供应工作，解决了运输力不足的困难。此外，有些工程处还与卖方商量好，将材料送到工地；有的工程处则自己组织运输队，负责供应工作。在这方面，运输部门和其他有关单位也做了许多工作。有力的配合了“抢工”运动的进行。
    现在，北京市的建筑工程，除了有重点地进行冬季施工工程外，已全部结束。北京市建筑公司和北京市建筑工会筹备委员会正全力投入总结经验和准备冬季训练工人和干部的工作。
