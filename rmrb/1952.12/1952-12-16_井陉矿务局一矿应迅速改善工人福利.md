    The No. 1 Mine of the Jingxing Mining Bureau Should Quickly Improve Workers' Welfare

    To the Editor: The administrative leaders of the No. 1 Mine of the Jingxing Mining Bureau are seriously neglecting workers' welfare, focusing solely on production. The bathhouse in the mine is very small, with only two pools that are fifteen meters long and two meters wide, yet five or six hundred people from a small shift bathe there each time. Because the pools are small and crowded, workers have to change clothes outside, causing many to catch colds and become ill. The trade union has proposed to the administration that a mat shed be built outside the bathhouse, plastered with mud, and then stoves installed to create a changing room. But to this day, this problem has not been resolved; the administration has only perfunctorily erected a small alleyway with mats, which provides no protection from the cold. On November 14th, the number of sick workers due to bathing increased from one hundred to three hundred, severely affecting attendance and the workers' health.

    In the riveting factory of the No. 1 Mine, the roof has more than thirty holes, leaking rain in the summer and snow in the winter, preventing workers from working effectively. When it is cold, they cannot even hold their tools. The trade union has also suggested repairs to the administration, but the administration has ignored them.

    We believe that the administrative leaders of the No. 1 Mine of the Jingxing Mining Bureau should recognize the importance of solving workers' welfare problems in order to smoothly complete the production tasks assigned by the state. We also hope that they will conduct a thorough self-criticism.

### 井陉矿务局一矿应迅速改善工人福利

    井陉矿务局一矿应迅速改善工人福利
    编辑同志：井陉矿务局一矿行政领导干部只顾生产，忽视工人福利的现象严重。该矿洗澡塘很小，只有两个十五公尺长、二公尺宽的水池，每次一小班就有五、六百人洗澡。由于池子小，人多，挤不过来，工人只好到屋外面去换衣服，很多人因此着凉生病。工会曾向行政方面提议，要求在澡堂外面搭席棚，抹上泥，然后按上炉子做换衣室。但直至今天，这问题还未解决，行政方面只是用席子敷衍着搭了一个小胡同，根本不能御寒。十一月十四日，因洗澡而生病的病号由一百个增加到三百个，严重地影响了出勤率和工人的身体健康。
    一矿铆工厂的工作场所，房顶上有三十多个窟窿，夏天漏雨，冬天漏雪，使工人不能很好的工作，天冷时手都拿不住工具。工会也曾向行政方面建议修补，行政方面毫不理睬。
    我们认为井陉矿务局一矿的行政领导干部，应认识解决工人福利问题的重要性，以便顺利地完成国家交给的生产任务。并希望他们作出深刻检讨。
