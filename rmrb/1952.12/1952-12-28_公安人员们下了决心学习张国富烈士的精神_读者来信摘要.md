    Public Security Personnel Determined to Learn from the Spirit of Martyr Zhang Guofu
    ——Reader's Letters Abstract
    After the third page of this newspaper published the "Order of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government on Posthumously Awarding Zhang Guofu as a Model People's Policeman" and the short commentary "Learn from Zhang Guofu's Spirit of Loving the People" on December 12, readers have continuously sent letters expressing their desire to learn from Martyr Zhang Guofu. Readers working in the public security departments, in particular, started by examining their own shortcomings and expressed that they will work hard to learn from Martyr Zhang Guofu. Except for those previously published separately, here is an abstract of readers' letters.
    Zheng Guiyu from the Public Security Bureau of Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, wrote: "I am a female people's policeman. Since I started working on household registration in 1951, the ideological style of the old police has been growing in my mind. More seriously, after the 'Three-Anti' Movement, I was still concerned with personal treatment, pursuing private desires. If my 'goals' were not achieved, I felt that working as a policeman had no 'future'; I even felt that working as a policeman had 'authority but no power,' and it was better to change careers. After reading the deeds of the model people's policeman, Martyr Zhang Guofu, and comparing them with myself, I realized that I was just wearing the guise of a people's policeman, and in reality, there was no difference between my thoughts and actions and those of an old policeman! From now on, I am determined to learn from Martyr Zhang Guofu, go deep among the masses, become one with the masses, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, cultivate the spirit of sacrificing oneself for the group, and be a glorious people's policeman under the banner of Mao Zedong." Wang Liwen from the Tangshan Public Security Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration wrote: "When we studied the model deeds of Martyr Zhang Guofu, we all combined it with examining our own thoughts. Martyr Zhang Guofu has become a mirror for us. Whether in our work or in our daily lives, we use the deeds of Martyr Zhang Guofu to encourage ourselves. We hope that through studying Martyr Zhang Guofu, we will improve in our work and in our thoughts." Kang Minyi and Xue Yuzhong, students of the Public Security School of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, wrote: "We are also public security personnel. But in our thinking, there are still selfish ideas, and in our studies, we are not wholeheartedly studying for the people. Now we have realized that these are all wrong. From now on, we are determined to learn from the noble qualities of Martyr Zhang Guofu." An Jing from the Emmu Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Dunhua County, Jilin Province, wrote: "I am also a people's policeman, but compared to Martyr Zhang Guofu, I am far behind: First, sometimes when the superiors transfer my work, if it does not meet my requirements, my work mood becomes low; second, when working in the countryside, I only look for village cadres and rarely contact the masses, so my work does not have any achievements. The deeds of Martyr Zhang Guofu have greatly educated me. From now on, I am determined to overcome the shortcomings in my work and learn from Martyr Zhang Guofu's spirit of loving the people."

    公安人员们下了决心学习张国富烈士的精神
    ——读者来信摘要
    十二月十二日本报第三版发表了“中央人民政府公安部关于追认张国富烈士为模范人民警察的命令”和“学习张国富热爱人民的精神”的简评后，读者连续来信表示要向张国富烈士学习，在公安部门工作的读者们，更从检查自己的缺点开始，表示将努力向张国富烈士学习。读者们的来信，除前已单独发表的以外，今摘要如下。
    辽西省义县人民政府公安局郑桂玉来信说：“我是一个女人民警察。我自一九五一年参加作户籍工作后，旧警察的思想作风，就在脑子里滋长着。更严重的，是‘三反’运动后，我仍然计较个人待遇，追求私欲，稍达不到我的‘目的’，我就认为作警察工作没有‘前途’；还曾经感到作警察工作‘有职无权’，真不如转业。看了模范人民警察张国富烈士的事迹，和自己对比一下，我才认识到自己只是披着人民警察的外衣，而实际上与一个旧警察的思想行为没有什么区别！今后我决心学习张国富烈士，深入群众，和群众打成一片，分清敌我，养成舍己为群的精神，作一个毛泽东旗帜下的光荣的人民警察。”天津铁路管理局唐山公安段王立文来信说：“我们学习张国富烈士的模范事迹时，都结合着检查了各自的思想。张国富烈士已经成了我们的一面镜子。我们不论在工作中、在日常生活中，都用张国富烈士的事迹来鼓舞自己。希望着：通过对张国富烈士的学习，我们在工作上、思想上都提高一步。”北京市人民政府公安局公安学校学员康敏义、薛玉忠来信说：“我们也是公安人员。但我们在思想上仍存在着自私自利的想法，在学习上还不是忠心耿耿地为人民而学习。现在我们已经认识到，这都是错误的。今后，我们下定决心要学习张国富烈士的高贵品质。”吉林省敦化县人民政府公安局额穆派出所安静来信说：“我也是人民警察，但和张国富烈士比起来，我却差得很远：一、有时上级调动我的工作，如不合我的要求，工作情绪就低落；二、下乡工作时，我只是去找村干部，而很少联系群众，所以我的工作谈不到什么成绩。张国富烈士的事迹大大地教育了我。我今后决克服工作中的缺点，学习张国富烈士热爱人民的精神。”
