Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. On December 7th, the U.S. side killed one and seriously wounded one of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp. General Nan Ri, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, lodged a serious protest to the other side in writing on December 10th, pointing out that the U.S. side cannot escape responsibility for the war crime of murdering prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th. According to the U.S. side's announcement, on the 8th of this month, two more of our captured personnel were killed and wounded on Koje Island.

According to the U.S. side's claim: these two prisoners of war were killed and wounded for entering the so-called "restricted area" in the camp. A United Press dispatch from Busan on the 10th revealed that the areas designated as "restricted areas" by the U.S. side were originally the kitchens in the camp. This is another barbaric crime by the U.S. side in violation of the Geneva Convention. Article 21 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "The Detaining Power may subject prisoners of war to internment. It may order them not to go beyond certain limits of the camp, if the latter is enclosed, or outside its perimeter, if it is not enclosed." The Geneva Convention's restrictions on the freedom of movement of prisoners of war are limited to this. Now the U.S. side has designated the kitchens as "restricted areas" in the camp surrounded by barbed wire, and does not allow prisoners of war to move freely in the camp. This is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. From this new atrocity by the U.S. side, people can also see that the U.S. side is using the policy of blocking the kitchen and not allowing prisoners of war to eat to exert pressure on those prisoners of war who firmly demand repatriation. Such is the shameful truth of the "humanitarianism" in the mouths of the American aggressors.

    南日将军抗议美方又打死打伤我被俘人员
    【新华社开城十日电】十二月七日美方在巨济岛战俘营又打死和重伤我方被俘人员各一人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十二月十日向对方书面提出严重抗议，指出美方决不能逃脱虐杀战俘的战争罪行的责任。
    【新华社开城十一日电】据美方宣布，在本月八日，巨济岛上又有两名我方被俘人员被打死和打伤。
    据美方宣称：这两名战俘都是因为进入所谓营场中的“禁区”而被打死打伤的。合众社釜山十日电透露，被美方划为“禁区”的原来都是营场里的厨房。这是美方又一个破坏日内瓦公约的野蛮罪行。日内瓦公约第二十一条规定：“拘留国得将战俘拘禁。得令战俘不得越出拘留营一定界限，若上述拘留营设有围栅，则不得越出围栅范围。”日内瓦公约规定的对于战俘行动自由的限制，仅止于此。现在美方竟然在四周布满了铁丝网的营场里，将厨房划为“禁区”，不许战俘在营场中自由行动，这是完全违反日内瓦公约的行为。从美方这一新的暴行中，人们还可以看出，美方正在用封锁厨房，不让战俘吃饭的政策，来对那些坚决要求遣返的战俘施行压力。美国侵略者嘴里的“人道主义”的可耻真相就是如此。
