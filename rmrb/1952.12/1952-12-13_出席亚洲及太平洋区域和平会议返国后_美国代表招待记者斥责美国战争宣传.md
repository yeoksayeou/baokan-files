Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 11th (TASS): American representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, California teachers Isabel Cerney and Edwin Cerney, emphasized at a press conference that the people of Asia want peace, want peaceful negotiations on all unresolved issues, want a ban on all weapons of mass destruction, and want simultaneous disarmament. They said they found that the people of Asia are determined to manage their own lives and affairs. When they visited the Soviet Union, China, and the Eastern European People's Democracies, they never heard a word about war or the atomic bomb, while American newspapers were full of such words, "almost to the point of not publishing anything else." They contrasted the U.S. State Department's efforts to prevent American representatives from attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with the Soviet Union's polite permission for representatives to travel to China via the Soviet Union.

They emphasized that in order to achieve peace, it is necessary to negotiate the Korean issue sincerely, disarm Japan and Germany, and abide by the principle of equality among all nations. Both strongly condemned the U.S. State Department's confiscation of their passports after they returned to the United States.

    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议返国后
    美国代表招待记者斥责美国战争宣传
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约十一日讯：出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表、加利福尼亚州的教师依莎贝尔·塞尔奈和艾得温·塞尔奈二人在记者招待会上强调说：亚洲人民希望和平，希望就一切未解决的问题举行和平谈判，希望禁止一切大规模毁灭的武器，并希望同时进行裁减军备。他们说：他们发现亚洲人民坚决要管理自己的生活和事务。当他们访问苏联、中国和东欧人民民主国家的时候，他们从来没有听到过任何一句关于战争或原子弹的话，而在美国报纸上却充满了这一类的话，“几乎到了不登载任何其它东西的地步”。他们把美国国务院竭力阻止美国代表前往出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的行为与苏联有礼貌地允许代表们假道苏联前往中国的行为作了一个对比。
    他们强调说：要想获得和平，必须诚诚恳恳地谈判朝鲜问题，解除日本和德国的武装，遵守各民族平等的原则。两人都强烈地斥责美国国务院在他们返美后没收他们的护照的行为。
