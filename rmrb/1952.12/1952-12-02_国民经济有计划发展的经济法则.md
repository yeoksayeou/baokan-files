The economic law of planned development of the national economy
By G. Gladkov (Soviet Union)

"The law of planned development of the national economy arose as the antithesis to the law of competition and anarchy of production under the capitalist system. It arose on the basis of the socialization of the means of production after the law of competition and anarchy of production ceased to be effective. It took effect because the socialist national economy can only be carried out on the basis of the economic law of planned development of the national economy." - Stalin, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" (I)

Comrade Stalin pointed out in his creative Marxist classic "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that the basic economic law that determines the essence of each mode of production provides the key to understanding and explaining all the laws of the socio-economic development.

The basic economic law of modern capitalism exposes and elucidates the profound and irreconcilable contradictions that divide capitalist society. Comrade Stalin proved that the main features and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism are "to secure the maximum capitalist profit through the exploitation, ruin and impoverishment of the majority of the population of the given country, through the enslavement and systematic plunder of the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and, lastly, through wars and militarization of the national economy, which are utilized for the obtaining of the highest profits."

In the capitalist economy, which is divided into isolated enterprises of various capitalists and their monopolistic associations that produce to obtain maximum profits, brutal competition and anarchy of production reign supreme. The capitalist mode of production is characterized by crises, periodic interruptions in production and technological development accompanied by the destruction of productive forces. This is the reason why any attempt at economic "planning" in capitalist countries is bound to fail. The actual reality of modern capitalism shatters the theories and schemes concocted by the lackeys of the bourgeoisie about the omnipotence of "organized" or "planned" capitalism. Capitalism and planned business operations are incompatible.

Socialist society is completely opposed to capitalism.

The socialism that has been built in the Soviet Union and is being built in the People's Democracies is a new, more advanced social system than capitalism, where the means of production are owned by society and form the basis of new relations of production between people—the relations of comradely cooperation and socialist mutual assistance among workers free from exploitation. The socialist economy knows no crises or unemployment, no poverty or bankruptcy of the masses. In contrast to decaying capitalism, the socialist society is characterized by a constant rise and flourishing of productive forces. This is determined by the basic economic law of socialism, the main features and requirements of which are: to secure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole of society through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher technology.

The planned development of the national economy is a characteristic of the socialist system. This progressive feature and the great superiority of socialism over capitalism are the result of the transformation of economic life brought about by the socialist revolution. Based on the economic law that the relations of production must conform with the nature of the forces of production, the Soviet regime nationalized the means of production, making them the property of the whole people, thereby eliminating the system of exploitation and creating a socialist economic form.

Comrade Stalin pointed out in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that after the socialist revolution, due to the fundamental transformation of the socio-economic base, the economic laws inherent in capitalism lose their validity and leave the stage. On the basis of the new economic conditions, new economic laws inherent in socialism arise and take effect. With the socialization of the means of production, the laws of competition and anarchy of production cease to be effective. On the basis of the new economic conditions, the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy arises and takes effect.

The law of planned development of the national economy took effect because the socialist national economy can only be carried out on the basis of the economic law of planned development of the national economy. If the contradiction between the private capitalist ownership of the means of production and the public character of the production process is the cause of competition and anarchy of production, excluding the planned development of the economy, then the public ownership of the means of production unites all the enterprises of the country into a unified economic organism and is the condition for the planned development of the entire national economy.

Now, the socialist national economy is composed of many organically interconnected branches of production and millions of industrial, agricultural, transportation, commercial, public and other enterprises. In the socialist national economy, hundreds of billions of production funds are concentrated, and hundreds of millions of workers are engaged in work. This huge public economy can only be realized and developed in a planned way.

Comrade Stalin taught that the role of the law of planned development of the national economy and the planning of the national economy enables the socialist economy to get rid of the periodic economic crises that destroy the national economy and cause huge material losses to society, and ensures the continuous rise of the socialist national economy.

(II)

The law of planned, proportional development of the national economy is not the basic economic law of socialism, because it does not point out the tasks to be accomplished by the planned development of the national economy. This task is contained in the form of the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. The role of the law of planned, proportional development of the national economy is subordinate to the basic economic law of socialism. Therefore, the role of the law of planned development of the national economy can only be fully发挥起来 when it is based on the basic economic law of socialism.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that our annual plans and five-year plans should not be confused with the objective economic law of planned, proportional development of the national economy. The planning of the national economy is a more or less true reflection of this law. It can only achieve good results if it correctly reflects the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy and is in all respects suitable for the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism.

Comrade Stalin instructed:

"The law of planned development of the national economy enables our planning organs to correctly plan social production. However, possibility should not be confused with reality. These are two different things. To turn this possibility into reality, it is necessary to study this economic law, master it, learn to apply it with complete knowledge, and formulate plans that fully reflect the requirements of this law."

With the expansion and consolidation of the public ownership of the means of production, that is, the socialist relations of production, the planning of the national economy in the Soviet Union has also developed and strengthened. It is strengthened and perfected on the basis of the planning organs understanding the socialist economic laws and using these laws more correctly for the benefit of society. The growing achievements of the Soviet planned economy prove that the economic plans and economic policies of the socialist countries are increasingly fully and correctly reflecting the objective laws of planned development of the national economy, and are increasingly suitable for the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. The Communist Party is good at applying the economic laws of social development in its economic policies and practical activities.

In the resolute struggle against the anti-Marxist "spontaneity" and "laissez-faire" theories in economic construction, against the capitulationist "plans", and against the sabotage activities of the Trotsky-Bukharin elements and other enemies of socialism who restored capitalism, our Party developed and consolidated the planning of the national economy in the Soviet Union.

Due to the implementation of several Stalinist five-year plans, our country has changed from a country that was backward in technology and economy to a powerful socialist country with industry and collective farms. Stalin's five-year plans for building socialism and communism are a clear proof of the wisdom and correctness of the Communist Party's policy. The Communist Party's policy is based on a deep understanding of economic laws and using them for the benefit of society.

The Communist Party, armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, has the ability to correctly determine the direction, to recognize the objective process of events and to foresee their development in the future. The program of Lenin and Stalin for building socialism and communism, which is embodied in the economic plans of the socialist countries, is a model of this scientific foresight.

Comrade Malenkov pointed out in the summary report on the work of the Central Committee at the Nineteenth Party Congress that the Party's plan for the future, that is, the plan that determines our future and the road we must follow in our advancement, is formulated on the basis of the knowledge of economic laws and on the basis of the science of building a communist society as explained by Comrade Stalin. The Communist Party not only scientifically stipulates the current tasks of economic construction, but also uses its organizational work to victoriously realize these economic plans.

The Soviet economic plans, which are based on the requirements of the socialist economic laws and summarize the rich experience of the masses, determine and guide the economic life of the country, give a unified purpose, and ensure the unity of action of the working people. In order to adapt to the achievements of advanced workers and the achievements of modern science and technology, the economic plans of the Communist Party and the Soviet state mobilize and organize the creative enthusiasm of communist builders.

In Comrade Stalin's brilliant instruction that economic plans cannot be reduced to a list of numbers and tasks, and that production plans are the living practice of millions of people, the true content of economic plans in socialist countries is revealed, and the mobilizing and organizing power of plans is emphasized.

(III)

Lenin pointed out that the planned nature of the economy is the balance (or correspondence) in the development of social production. The planned (proportional) development of the national economy is incompatible with capitalism. The imbalance between the various parts of social production is a characteristic of the capitalist economy. The constant disruption of the balance in production development leads to huge waste of social labor and non-productive use of the means of production. Destructive economic crises are the most obvious example.

Under the socialist system, in contrast to capitalism, the balance in the development of various economic sectors is an objective necessity. Under the socialist mode of production, the proportion in production, the distribution of social labor and means of production, the relationship between the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods, the relationship between industry and agriculture and other economic sectors, are determined by the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism and the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy. The planned nature (equilibrium) of socialist economic development and the rational combination of various sectors of social production enable the socialist economy to rise continuously.

The specific economic proportions determined by the national economic plan in this period or that period are subject to the main tasks of building socialism and communism, developing and increasing social wealth, consolidating the economic independence of the country, strengthening national defense, and continuously improving the material welfare of the people.

In Comrade Stalin's works and in the resolutions of the Communist Party, there are scientific and profound analyses of the specific proportions of the development of various economic sectors at various stages of socialist and communist construction. Stalin pointed out in his works the necessity of ensuring the correct proportions between the various sectors of the national economy, and pointed out the specific proportional interdependencies arising from a certain level of productive forces and the tasks facing the socialist country in a certain period.

Comrade Stalin emphasized in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" the great significance of Marx's theory of reproduction for the planning of the national economy. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the basic principles of Marx's theory of reproduction are also effective under the socialist system. It is impossible for socialist society not to apply these principles of Marx's theory of reproduction when planning the national economy.

The proportional development of the national economy requires material, labor and financial reserves and the correct use of these reserves. Comrade Stalin raised and clarified in his work the issue of reserves being an important condition for the planned (proportional) development of the national economy. The necessity of reserves is also determined by the interests of national defense.

Socialist countries concentrate huge material and financial resources in their hands and distribute them in a planned way to various sectors of the national economy. Imperialist countries are expanding economic militarization and the arms race in order to ensure the highest profits for the capitalist giants. In contrast to imperialist countries, the Soviet state is developing peaceful economic construction and cultural construction in order to maximize the satisfaction of the society's growing needs in accordance with the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism.

The main feature of the planned development of the national economy is the rational allocation of productive forces by bringing industry closer to the sources of raw materials and consumer areas, and the comprehensive development of the economy of the main economic regions. Based on the law of planned development of the national economy, socialist countries have realized a fundamental reform in the allocation of productive forces—establishing a strong industrial base and center in new regions, and developing a new base for commodity grain and technical crops. The economy and culture of the national republics have prospered on the basis of the Lenin-Stalin national policy.

The comprehensive development of productive forces is a characteristic of the planned economy. Stalin's communist construction—the huge hydropower stations and canal constructions on the Volga and the Dnieper, the Don and the Amu Darya, are models of this comprehensive development. Each of these constructions includes hydropower stations, dams, canals, reservoirs and irrigation systems. Comprehensive new buildings solve the huge tasks in the development of industry, agriculture and transportation. This is only possible under a planned economy.

The main features of the basic economic law of socialism determine the general purpose and general tasks of the planning of the national economy at all stages of the Soviet economic development. The requirements of the basic economic law of socialism and the role of the law of planned development of the national economy are concretely expressed in the economic plans of this period or that period.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that the continuous improvement and perfection of socialist production on the basis of high technology is the means to achieve the goal of ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the society's constantly growing material and cultural needs. This law of socialism is vividly reflected in the Soviet Union's five-year development plan for 1951-1955.

The Fifth Five-Year Plan created the preconditions for the continuous improvement of production in the subsequent five-year plans. The task of enhancing the production capacity of important sectors of heavy industry, the task of widely building new enterprises in light industry and the food industry, the task of strengthening the capacity of hydropower stations, the task of starting up the large hydropower stations in Kubyshevsk, Kamsk, Gorky City, Mingechaur, Ust-Kamenogorsk and other areas, the task of developing the Stalingrad, Kakhovka and Novosibirsk hydropower stations, the task of starting the construction of the Cheboksary on the Volga River, the Votkinsk on the Kama River, the Bukhedarminsk on the Irtysh River and many other large hydropower stations, these tasks prove this point.

Comrade Stalin taught that the more rapid improvement of the production of the means of production than the production of consumer goods is the most important condition for the continuous improvement of social production. Under the capitalist system, the rapid increase in the means of production intensifies the antagonistic contradictions between production and consumption. Under the socialist system, the more rapid growth of the production of the means of production than the production of consumer goods ensures the continuous improvement of the entire social production and is the foundation of socialist expanded reproduction.

Therefore, the growth of the production of the means of production with priority status is guaranteed in the economic plans of socialist countries. The new five-year plan stipulates that the average annual growth rate of the production of the means of production is 13%, and the average annual growth rate of the production of consumer goods is 11%. The new five-year plan stipulates that all sectors of the national economy should achieve more powerful technological progress in accordance with the policy of continuously improving technology and technical procedures, in accordance with the policy of adopting new machines and machinery and new production methods in the national economy, and in accordance with the policy of making every effort to develop the electrification, mechanization, and automation of the production process.

The measures taken by socialist countries to strengthen the technical basis of all sectors of the national economy and to mechanize production demonstrate the fundamental characteristics and superiority of socialism over capitalism. In capitalist society, the development of technology is completely subject to strengthening the exploitation of the working people in order to increase the profits of the capitalists. Under the socialist system, machines save labor and lighten people's work, which guarantees a continuous increase in labor productivity.

The more productive use of economic resources and social labor, the fuller excavation of the potential capabilities and reserves in the socialist economic system, and the transformation of these potentials and reserves into practical results of economic and cultural construction, are the characteristics of socialist production.

The socialist national economy has huge and ever-increasing economic potential and resources. However, it would be wrong to think that these potentials can be transformed into practical economic results by themselves. Our economic organs and planning organs must be good at using these potentials, mobilizing these potentials to the maximum, and continuously improving production organization and economic leadership methods.

The Nineteenth Party Congress of our Party pointed out the main shortcomings in mobilizing and correctly using the internal resources of the national economy. Many enterprises have not made full use of their equipment, and there are huge wastes and non-productive expenses. Some industrial sectors have not completed the tasks of production plans and reducing product costs.

In order to ensure the continuous improvement of the entire social production and to produce abundant products in our country, it is necessary to thoroughly master the art of planned and rational use of all material, financial and labor resources in accordance with the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy and in all respects suitable for the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. Comrade Malenkov specially emphasized this task in the summary report on the work of the Central Committee at the Nineteenth Party Congress of our Party.

In order to carry out production rationally, it is necessary to correctly use the law of value. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that under the socialist system, the law of value is not the regulator of production, and the scope of its operation is limited by the existence of public ownership of the means of production, the role of the law of planned development of the national economy, and the economic plans of the socialist countries. However, the law of value has an impact on production, and our enterprises cannot and should not ignore the law of value. Mastering the law of value helps us to accurately calculate the production volume and evaluate the reality in production, teaches our economic workers to seek, discover and use the potential reserves within production, improve production methods, reduce production costs, realize economic accounting, and enable enterprises to be profitable.

The great tasks of the Stalinist Five-Year Plan, which guarantee a new and powerful rise in the Soviet national economy, guarantee a further significant increase in the material welfare and cultural level of the people and the strengthening of our national defense, make the socialist competition of the whole people have a new scale. The new plan for great work will be victoriously realized by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party with heroic labor.

Stalin's plan for great work has great international significance. The five-year plan that ensured the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union and guaranteed the victorious construction of communism in the Soviet Union makes the entire progressive humanity feel proud.

The Soviet Union's experience in planned leadership of the national economy is being used in the People's Democracies. The achievements of these countries' planned development of the economy are increasing year by year. The Soviet Union is giving the People's Democracies huge and all-round assistance.

The socialist economic system is developing and prospering on the basis of brotherly cooperation and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, showing its superiority over the capitalist system. In contrast to the imperialist camp, which is shrouded in brutal competition and the enslavement of some countries by others, the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is based on equality and a sincere desire to help each other in order to achieve common economic growth. The comradely coordination of the economic plans of these countries is an important factor in strengthening the strength of the democratic and socialist camp.

Comrade Stalin's revelation and demonstration of the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy has enriched Marxist-Leninist political economy and raised the planned leadership of the economy to a new stage. The Soviet people, armed with the knowledge of socialist economic laws, will wage a more successful struggle for greater achievements in economic construction in order to maximize the satisfaction of social needs and for the victory of communism.

    国民经济有计划发展的经济法则
    苏联格拉特可夫
    “国民经济有计划发展的法则，是作为资本主义制度下竞争和生产无政府状态的法则的对立物而产生的。它是当竞争和生产无政府状态的法则失去效力以后，在生产资料公有化的基础上产生的。它之所以发生了作用，是因为只有在国民经济有计划发展的经济法则的基础上，社会主义的国民经济才能进行。”　——斯大林“苏联社会主义经济问题”（一）
    斯大林同志在创造性的马克思主义的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出：决定每个生产方式的本质的基本经济法则，给予了解和说明该社会经济发展的一切规律的钥匙。
    现代资本主义的基本经济法则揭发和阐明了分裂着资本主义社会的深刻的、不可调和的矛盾。斯大林同志证明：现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特征和要求是“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”
    在被分割成为取得最大限度利润而进行生产的各个资本家的孤立企业及他们的垄断联合的资本主义经济下，残酷的竞争和生产的无政府状态占着统治地位。资本主义生产方式的特征，是危机、伴随生产力的破坏而来的生产和技术发展中的周期性的中断。这一切就是资本主义国家经济“计划化”的任何尝试必然失败的原因。现代资本主义的实际的现实，粉碎了资产阶级的佣仆们所捏造的“有组织的”或“计划化的”资本主义的万能的理论和方案。资本主义和有计划地经营业务是不相容的。
    社会主义社会和资本主义是完全相对立的。
    在苏联已建成的和正在各人民民主国家建设着的社会主义，——这是一种新的、比资本主义更高级的社会制度，在这里，生产资料为社会所占有，并且是人们的新的生产关系——即摆脱了剥削的工作者的同志的合作和社会主义的互助的关系的基础。社会主义经济不知道危机和失业，不知道人民大众的贫穷和破产。和腐朽的资本主义相反，社会主义社会的特点是生产力的不断高涨和繁荣。这是由社会主义的基本经济法则所决定的，社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    国民经济有计划的发展，是社会主义制度的特征。这一进步的特点和社会主义对资本主义的伟大的优越性，是由社会主义革命而实现的经济生活中的变革的结果。苏维埃政权根据生产关系一定要适合于生产力的性质这个经济法则，把生产资料公有化了，使之成为全民的财产，因而消灭了剥削制度，创造了社会主义的经济形态。
    斯大林同志在其天才的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出，在社会主义革命后，由于社会经济基础的根本改造，资本主义所固有的诸经济法则便失去效力，退出舞台。在新的经济条件的基础上，新的、社会主义所固有的诸经济法则产生并发生作用。随着生产资料的公有化，竞争和生产无政府状态的法则失去效力。在新的经济条件的基础上，国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的法则产生和发生作用。
    国民经济有计划发展的法则所以发生了作用，是因为只有在国民经济有计划发展的经济法则的基础上，社会主义的国民经济才能进行。如果生产资料的私人资本主义所有制和生产过程的公共性质与私人资本主义的占有形式之间的矛盾是竞争和生产无政府状态的原因，排斥着经济的有计划的发展，那末，生产资料的公共所有制则把国家的一切企业联合为一个统一的经济有机体，是整个国民经济有计划的发展的条件。
    现在，社会主义的国民经济是由许多彼此有机地相联系的生产部门和千百万工业的、农业的、运输的、商业的、公共的以及其他的企业组成的。在社会主义的国民经济中集中着亿万生产基金，千百万工作者在从事工作。这种巨大的公共经济只有有计划地才能实现和发展。
    斯大林同志教导说，国民经济有计划发展的法则的作用和国民经济的计划化，使社会主义经济摆脱了使国民经济遭受破坏和给社会招致巨大的物质损失的周期性的经济危机，保证社会主义的国民经济不断高涨。
    （二）
    国民经济有计划的、按比例发展的法则，不是社会主义的基本经济法则，因为它没有指出国民经济有计划的发展所要完成的任务。这个任务以社会主义基本经济法则的要求的形式包含在社会主义的基本经济法则中。国民经济有计划的、按比例发展的法则的作用从属于社会主义的基本经济法则。因此，国民经济有计划发展的法则的作用，只是在它以社会主义基本经济法则为依据时，才能充分发挥起来。
    斯大林同志指出，不能把我们的各个年度计划和五年计划跟国民经济有计划的、按比例发展的客观经济法则混为一谈。国民经济计划化是这一法则的多少真实的反映。它只有在正确反映国民经济有计划发展的法则的要求和在各方面适合社会主义基本经济法则的要求时，才能得到良好的结果。
    斯大林同志指示说：
    “国民经济有计划发展的法则，使我们的计划机关有可能去正确地计划社会生产。但是，不能把可能同现实混为一谈。这是两种不同的东西。要把这种可能变为现实，就必须研究这个经济法则，必须掌握它，必须学会以完备的知识去应用它，必须制定出能完全反映这个法则的要求的计划。”
    随着生产资料的公共所有制、即社会主义的生产关系的扩大和巩固，苏联的国民经济计划化也发展和加强起来。它在计划机关认识社会主义的经济法则并更正确地利用这些法则来为社会谋福利的基础上加强和完善起来。苏联计划经济的增长着的成就证明：社会主义国家的经济计划和经济政策日益充分地和正确地反映着国民经济有计划发展的客观法则，日益适合于社会主义基本经济法则的要求。共产党善于在自己的经济政策和实践活动中运用社会发展的经济法则。
    在跟经济建设中的反马克思主义的“自发”论和“自流”论、跟投降主义的“计划”、跟资本主义的复辟者托洛茨基—布哈林分子及社会主义的其他敌人的破坏活动作坚决的斗争中，我党发展和巩固了苏联的国民经济计划化。
    由于实现了几个斯大林五年计划，我们的祖国从在技术—经济方面落后的国家，变为强大的工业和集体农庄的社会主义国家。斯大林的几个建设社会主义和共产主义的五年计划，是共产党的政策之英明和正确的显明证明。共产党的政策是以深刻地认识经济法则并把它们用来为社会谋福利为依据的。
    为马克思—列宁主义的理论所武装的共产党，有正确决定方向的能力，能够认识事变的客观进程并预见它们在将来的发展。被具体化在社会主义国家的经济计划中的列宁—斯大林的建设社会主义和共产主义的纲领，就是这种科学预见的典范。
    马林科夫同志在第十九次党代表大会上关于中央委员会的工作总结报告中指出，党关于未来的计划，即决定我们的前途以及我们在前进中所要遵循的道路的计划，是依据经济法则的知识，依据斯大林同志所阐明的建设共产主义社会的科学而制定的。共产党不仅科学地规定当前的经济建设任务，而且用自己的组织工作来胜利地实现这些经济计划。
    以社会主义经济法则的要求为依据并总结了人民群众的丰富经验的苏联的经济计划，决定和指导国家的经济生活，给予统一的目的，保证劳动人民的行动的统一。为了适应于先进劳动者的成就和现代科学和技术的成果，共产党和苏维埃国家的经济计划动员和组织着共产主义建设者的创造的积极性。
    在斯大林同志关于经济计划不能归结为数字和任务的一览表，生产计划是千百万人的活生生的实践活动这一英明指示中，揭发了社会主义国家经济计划的真实内容，强调了计划的动员和组织的力量。
    （三）
    列宁指出，经济的计划性即是社会生产发展中的均衡性（或者相适应）。国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展和资本主义是不相容的。社会生产各个部分间的不均衡是资本主义经济的特征。生产发展中的均衡的经常的破坏，引导至社会劳动的巨大的浪费和生产资料的非生产性的运用。破坏性的经济危机就是最明显的例证。
    在社会主义制度下，和资本主义相反，各经济部门的发展的均衡是客观的必需。在社会主义生产方式下，生产中的比例，社会劳动和生产资料的分配，生产资料生产和消费品生产间的关系，工业和农业及其他经济部门间的关系，是由社会主义基本经济法则的要求和国民经济有计划发展的法则的要求所决定的。社会主义经济发展的计划性（均衡性）和社会生产各部门的合理结合，使社会主义经济不断高涨。
    国家经济计划在这一时期或那一时期内确定的具体的经济比例，服从于建设社会主义和共产主义，发展和增加社会财富、巩固国家的经济上的独立性、加强国防力和不断提高人民的物质福利等主要任务。
    在斯大林同志的著作中，在共产党的决议中，作出了社会主义和共产主义建设各个阶段上各经济部门发展的具体比例的科学的和深刻的分析典范。斯大林在其著作中指出保证国民经济各部门间的正确比例的必要性，指出由于一定的生产力水平和摆在社会主义国家某一时期面前的任务而产生的具体比例的相互制约性。
    斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”的著作中着重指出马克思的再生产理论对于国民经济计划化的重大意义。斯大林同志指出，马克思的再生产理论的基本原理在社会主义制度下也是有效的。社会主义社会在计划国民经济时，不运用马克思的再生产理论的这些原理是不行的。
    国民经济按比例的发展要求具有物质的、劳动的和财政的后备力量及正确运用这些后备力量。斯大林同志在其著作中提出和阐明了后备力量是国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的重要条件的问题。后备力量的必要性也为国防的利益所决定。
    社会主义国家把巨大的物质和财政资源集中在自己的手中，把它们有计划地分配于国民经济的各部门。帝国主义国家为了保证资本巨头们的最高利润，正在扩大经济军事化和军备竞赛。和帝国主义国家相反，苏维埃国家为了按照社会主义基本经济法则的要求来最大限度地满足社会日益增长着的需要，正在发展着和平的经济建设和文化建设。
    国民经济有计划的发展的主要特征是通过使工业接近原料来源和消费地区的办法，来合理地配置生产力，以及各主要经济地区经济的综合的发展。社会主义国家根据国民经济有计划的发展的法则实现了在生产力的配置方面的根本改革——在新地区内建立起强大的工业基础和中心，发展了商品谷物和技术作物的新基础。各民族共和国的经济和文化在列宁—斯大林的民族政策的基础上繁荣起来。
    生产力的综合性的发展是计划经济的特征。斯大林的共产主义建设——伏尔加河和第聂泊河、顿河和阿姆河上的巨大的水电站和运河建筑，是这种综合性的发展的典范。这些建筑中的每一个都包括着水电站、堤坝、运河、蓄水池和灌溉系统。综合性的新建筑解决着工业、农业和运输业发展中的巨大任务。这只有在计划经济的条件下才有可能。
    社会主义基本经济法则的主要特征决定苏联经济发展的一切阶段上国民经济计划化的总目的和总任务。社会主义基本经济法则的要求和国民经济有计划发展的法则的作用，在这一时期或那一时期的经济计划中得到具体的表现。
    斯大林同志指出，社会主义生产在高度技术基础上不断提高和完善，是达到保证最大限度地满足社会经常增长着的物质和文化需要这一目的的手段。社会主义的这个规律鲜明地体现在一九五一——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划中。
    第五个五年计划创造了在以后的五年计划中不断提高生产的前提条件。增强重工业重要部门生产能力的任务，广泛建设轻工业和食品工业中的新企业的任务，加强水电站的能力，使古比雪夫斯克、卡木斯克、高尔基城、敏格恰乌斯克、乌斯奇—卡敏诺戈尔斯克及其他区大的水电站开动起来的任务，发展斯大林格勒、卡霍夫斯克和诺沃西比斯克水电站的任务，开始建筑伏尔加河岸的切保克沙尔斯克、卡姆河岸的沃特金斯克、伊尔提河岸的布黑达尔敏斯克和其他许多大水电站的任务，这些任务证明了这一点。
    斯大林同志教导说，生产资料生产比消费资料生产较为迅速的提高，是社会生产不断提高的最重要条件。在资本主义制度下，生产资料的迅速增加使生产和消费间的对抗性的矛盾加强。在社会主义制度下，生产资料的生产较消费资料的生产的更为迅速的增长，保证整个社会生产不断提高，是社会主义扩大再生产的基础。
    因而，生产资料生产的占优先地位的增长在社会主义国家的经济计划中得到保证。在新五年计划中规定生产资料生产增长的年平均率为百分之十三，消费品生产增长的年平均率为百分之十一。新五年计划规定按照使技术和技术手续不断完善的方针，按照在国民经济中采用新的机器和机械、新的生产方法的方针，以及按照尽力发展生产过程的电气化、机械化、自动化的方针，使国民经济的一切部门达到更强大的技术上的进步。
    在社会主义国家加强国民经济一切部门的技术基础和生产机械化的措施中，表现出社会主义对资本主义的根本特点和优越性。在资本主义社会里，技术的发展完全服从于加强对劳动人民的剥削以便增加资本家的利润。在社会主义制度下，机器节省劳动并减轻人们的工作，这保证着劳动生产率不断增长。
    经济资源和社会劳动的更为生产性的运用，社会主义经济制度中潜在的能力和后备力量的更充分的掘发，以及把这些潜力和后备力量变为经济和文化建设的实际成果，是社会主义生产的特征。
    社会主义的国民经济拥有巨大的而且是日益增大着的经济潜力和资源。然而如果认为这些潜力能够自己变成实际的经济成果，那就错了。我们的经济机关和计划机关必须善于运用这些潜力，最大限度地动员这些潜力，不断改善生产组织和经济领导方法。
    在我党第十九次代表大会上指出了在动员和正确运用国民经济内部资源方面的主要缺点。许多企业远没有充分利用设备，而且有着巨大的浪费和非生产性的耗费。有些工业部门没有完成生产计划和减低产品成本的任务。
    为要保证整个社会生产不断提高和在我国出产丰富的产品，必须根据国民经济有计划的发展的法则的要求以及在各方面适合于社会主义基本经济法则的要求，来彻底掌握有计划地、合理地运用一切物质的、财政的和劳动的资源的艺术。马林科夫同志在我党第十九次代表大会上关于中央委员会的工作总结报告中特别强调指出了这一任务。
    为了合理地进行生产，必须正确地运用价值法则。斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”的著作中指出，在社会主义制度下价值法则不是生产的调节者，它的发生作用的范围因生产资料的公有制的存在、国民经济有计划的发展的法则的作用和社会主义国家的经济计划而受到限制。然而，价值法则对于生产是有影响的，我们的企业是不能不而且不应该不考虑到价值法则的。掌握价值法则帮助我们精确地计算生产量和估量生产中的现实事物，教我们的经济工作人员寻求、发现和运用生产内部潜在的后备力量，改进生产方法，降低生产成本，实现经济核算，并使企业能够赢利。
    斯大林五年计划的伟大任务，保证苏联国民经济的新的、强大的高涨，保证人民的物质福利和文化水平进一步显著提高及我国国防力加强，使全民的社会主义竞赛具有新的规模。关于伟大的工作的新计划将由在共产党领导下的苏联人民用英勇的劳动来胜利地实现。
    斯大林关于伟大的工作的计划具有巨大的国际意义。确保了苏联社会主义的胜利并保证着胜利建设共产主义的苏联的五年计划，使整个进步人类产生自豪感。
    苏联有计划地领导国民经济的经验在被人民民主国家运用着。这些国家有计划地发展着的经济的成就逐年增多。苏联给予人民民主国家巨大的、各方面的援助。
    社会主义的经济制度在苏联和各人民民主国家兄弟般合作和互助的基础上发展和繁荣起来，表现出它比资本主义制度的优越性。和笼罩着残酷的竞争及一些国家被另一些国家所奴役的帝国主义阵营相反，苏联和人民民主国家的经济合作的基础是平等和互相帮助以便达到共同的经济高涨的真诚愿望。这些国家的经济计划的同志般的协调一致性，是民主和社会主义阵营实力增强的重要因素。
    斯大林同志对国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的法则的揭示和论证，丰富了马克思—列宁主义的政治经济学，把对经济的有计划的领导提高到新的阶段。用社会主义经济法则的知识武装起来的苏联人民，为了最大限度地保证社会需要，为了共产主义的胜利，将为争取经济建设中的更多的成就而进行更为成功的斗争。
