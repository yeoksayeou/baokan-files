Letter Summary

    The Nanyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should immediately correct the practice of abusing telegrams to issue instructions.
    The Nanyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party frequently use telegrams to issue instructions to their subordinate counties, and sometimes even use urgent telegrams. Most of the telegrams sent are in plain code, which means that there is no need for confidentiality. These instructions are generally two to three hundred words long, and longer ones are close to a thousand words, and some even have more than two thousand words. In this way, sending an instruction to more than a dozen counties in the entire prefecture not only costs a lot of money, but also requires a lot of manpower for both the sender and receiver to translate the telegrams. Sometimes there are many errors in the telegrams sent, making it impossible for the receiving unit to understand the content. There are direct telephone lines between the prefecture and the counties, and if telephones are used to convey instructions, a lot of manpower, materials, and time can be saved. I have raised this issue with them twice (the letter does not specify who - editor). But they replied: sending telegrams is to make everyone pay attention. I think this view is completely wrong, because whether subordinate organs pay attention to the instructions of higher authorities is not determined by the method of issuing instructions. Therefore, I suggest that the Nanyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party quickly correct the practice of abusing telegrams.
    Nanyang Fangcheng County People's Government Production Relief Office, Jia Naigui hopes that all parties will work together to eliminate impurities in cotton.
    Now that the new cotton is on the market, our factory has made all preparations to welcome the production upsurge after the new cotton arrives at the factory.
    In the past, we often found various kinds of impurities in cotton bales, such as: matches, scrap iron, rags, gravel, wood blocks, etc. These impurities often cause accidents in our factories and cause losses to state property. According to our incomplete statistics from January to August 1952, a total of 23 fires were caused by impurities in cotton, resulting in a loss of about one million yuan; 24 cotton carding machines were damaged, resulting in a loss of about 24 million yuan; and losses due to work stoppages are not included. Therefore, we hope that the peasant brothers who sell cotton, the comrades of the cooperatives who collect cotton, and the comrades of the ginning mills will pay special attention to eliminating impurities in cotton when processing this year's new cotton. This is of great benefit to increasing production and practicing economy, and building the motherland.
    All staff of the Qinghua and Pre-spinning Workshops of the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory.
    The Yangquan Mining Bureau should improve pithead inspection and acceptance work.
    The "tonnage increase" figures of the No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 mines under the Yangquan Mining Bureau are very large every year. Originally, pithead inspection and acceptance often calculated less than the actual weight. Accumulated in this way, a lot of extra coal is reported as "tonnage increase." This reduces costs for the mine, but the workers suffer because they do not receive the compensation they deserve for their labor. I suggest that the leaders of the Mining Bureau quickly improve the pithead inspection and acceptance work of each mine to protect the workers' legitimate interests and improve their production enthusiasm.

    The Central Film Bureau will dub a large number of films in the languages of various ethnic minorities.
    Under the leadership of the People's Government, we Mongolian herdsmen living on the Ikezhao League grassland can also see movies. I have seen two movies. The first time I saw "The White Haired Girl"; because this film was spoken in Chinese, I did not understand it. This year in September, the Central Visiting Group brought two films: "Great Unity of the Chinese Nation" and "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia." Both of these films were spoken in Mongolian. After watching them, I not only deeply realized Chairman Mao's meticulous care for our Mongolian people, but also received a lot of education.
    I think: If the films suitable for screening in Inner Mongolia could be dubbed in Mongolian, wouldn't we feel more intimate and get more education from watching them? Therefore, I hope that the film production department will appropriately dub some films in Mongolian in the future.
    Mongolian herdsman Man Tu from the Ikezhao League Autonomous Region
    Editor's note: The opinion put forward by reader Man Tu is correct. The Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau will dub a large number of films in the languages of various ethnic minorities in the future to meet the needs of ethnic minorities.
    Do not use airmail envelopes when mailing international ordinary letters.
    Recently, our Beijing Post Office has often found people using "airmail envelopes" to mail "international ordinary letters." This can easily cause foreign postal authorities to mistake them for underpaid mail and charge the recipient airmail fees. Therefore, in the future, when this bureau discovers that airmail envelopes are used to mail international ordinary letters, it will immediately return them to the sender to ask them to change to ordinary envelopes, or pay the airmail postage and mail them as airmail; however, doing so will delay the delivery time of the mail. It is best if everyone pays attention and does not use airmail envelopes to mail ordinary letters. Beijing Post Office
    Newspapers and periodicals in various regions should correct the phenomenon of abusing abbreviations.
    In some newspapers and periodicals, many unclear abbreviations still often appear, such as: "min gai" [民改], "zeng zi" [增资], "fu yun" [妇运], "ge dai hui" [各代会], etc. These words are not only confusing, such as "zeng zi," which is unclear whether it means "increase wages" or "increase capital," but also confuse the Chinese language. Newspapers and periodicals have a wide readership. The indiscriminate use of such unclear "abbreviations" by some newspapers and periodicals obviously has a very bad influence on the writing style of millions of readers. The People's Daily once called on everyone to fight for the purity and health of the motherland's language. I hope to raise the attention of newspapers and periodicals in various regions again to correct this phenomenon of abusing abbreviations.

专栏：来信摘要

    来信摘要
    南阳专署和中共南阳地委应即纠正滥用电报发指示的做法
    南阳专署和中共南阳地委经常用电报向所属各县发指示，甚至有时还用加急电报。所发电报，大部是用明码的，也就是说，这是没有保密必要的。这些指示一般二、三百字，长者近千字，个别还有二千多字的。这样，给全专区十多个县发一次指示不但要花很多钱，而且收发双方在翻译电报时也要费很多人力。有时发来的电报错误很多，使收报单位无法弄清内容。专区和各县间都有直达电话，如果用电话来传达指示，人力、物力和时间都可节约很多。我曾向他们（来信中未说明是谁——编者）提过两次意见。但他们答复：发电报为了引起大家重视。我认为这种看法是完全错误的，因为下级机关对上级指示是否重视，并不是由发指示的方法来决定的。因此，我建议南阳专署和中共南阳地委迅速纠正滥发电报的做法。
    河南方城县人民政府生产救灾办公室　贾乃贵希望各方面合力消除棉花中的
    杂物
    现在新花登场，我们工厂里已做好各种准备工作，迎接新花到厂后的生产高潮。
    过去我们常常从棉花包里发现多种多样的杂物，如：洋火、废铁、碎布、碎石、木块等。这些杂物，常常使我们工场里发生事故，使国家财产受到损失。根据我们一九五二年一月至八月的不完全统计，因棉花内的杂物而造成火灾共二十三次，损失约一百万元；损坏梳棉机二十四次，损失约二千四百万元；停工损失尚不计在内。因此，我们希望卖棉的农民兄弟们，收棉的合作社同志们及轧花厂同志们在处理今年新花的时候，特别注意消除棉花里的杂物。这对增产节约、建设祖国是有很大好处的。
    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂清花    前纺车间全体职工阳泉矿务局应该改进坑口检收工作
    阳泉矿务局所属二、三、四、五各矿每年“涨吨”数字甚大。原来坑口检收时，常要比实际重量计算得少一些。这样积累起来，就多出很多的煤，报作“涨吨”处理。这对矿上来说，是降低了成本；但是工人却吃了亏，没有得到劳动的应有报酬。我建议矿务局领导方面迅速改进各矿坑检收工作，以保障工人应有利益，提高工人生产情绪。

    中央电影局将大量译制各少数民族语言对白的影片
    在人民政府领导下，我们生活在伊克昭盟草原上的蒙族牧民也能看到了电影。我看了两次电影。第一次看的是“白毛女”；因为这个影片说的是汉话，我没有看懂。今年九月中央访问团带来了两部片子：“中华民族大团结”和“内蒙人民的胜利”。这两个影片都是说的蒙古话。我看了不但深深体会到毛主席对我们蒙族人民无微不至的关心，而且受到了不少教育。
    我想：假如适合于内蒙古地区放映的影片都能翻译成蒙语对白，我们看起来不是会更亲切并能得到更多的教育吗？因此，我希望制片部门今后适当地翻译些蒙语对白的影片。
    伊克昭盟自治区蒙族牧民　满突
    编者按：读者满突来信提出的意见是正确的。中央文化部电影局今后将大量译制各少数民族语言对白的影片，以适应少数民族的要求。
    投寄国际普通信函时不要用航空信封
    我们北京邮局近来常常发现有人用“航空信封”寄“国际普通信函”，这样很容易使外国邮政机关误作欠资邮件，向收件人罚航空资费。因此，今后本局在发现用航空信封寄国际普通信函时，准备即时退给寄件人请改换普通信封，或补纳航空邮费改按航空邮件邮寄；不过，这样做是会延误邮件投递时间的。最好请大家注意，不要再用航空信封寄普通信。　　　　北京邮局
    各地报纸刊物应纠正滥用简称的现象
    某些报纸刊物上，至今仍经常出现很多含义不清的简称，如：“民改”、“增资”、“妇运”、“各代会”等。这些词汇不但令人费解，如“增资”就不知到底是“增加工资”还是“增加资本”，而且会使中国文字发生混乱。报纸刊物都有广大的读者，某些报纸刊物滥造滥用这种含义不清的“简称”，显然对千万读者的文风有很不好的影响。人民日报曾经号召大家为祖国语言的纯洁和健康而斗争，希望再提起各地报纸刊物的注意，纠正这种滥用简称的现象。
