    Leadership Should Be Strengthened in Promoting Advanced Experiences
    Comrade Editor: Currently, many factories and mines are experiencing confusion in organization, leadership, and ideological understanding in the work of promoting advanced experiences. Some delegate the collection of "tricks" to the trade union's rationalization proposal committee, some temporarily establish an increase production and economize office, some are responsible by the production section, and some are taken over by the labor organization and wage section. Some people think that promoting advanced experiences and learning from advanced experiences is a mass activity, and once everyone starts doing it, there is nothing else to do. This is of course wrong. Precisely because it is mass work, it must have strong leadership. Moreover, this work is not a short-term crash task, but a long-term task.
    Therefore, I believe that each enterprise department should establish a special organization to collect and guide the promotion of all key advanced experiences in its enterprise system. The central enterprise management agencies should also establish a special agency to centrally lead this work, so as to exchange and disseminate advanced experiences in a timely manner.　Ye Ruiping

### 应该对推广先进经验的工作加强领导

    应该对推广先进经验的工作加强领导
    编辑同志：目前许多厂矿在推广先进经验工作中，组织领导与思想认识都非常混乱。有的交由工会合理化建议委员会收集“窍门”，有的是临时成立了增产节约办公室，有的归生产科负责，也有的是由劳动组织与工资科担任。有人认为推广先进经验，学习先进经验，是一项群众性的活动，只要大家干起来了，就没有什么事情可做了。这当然是错误的。正因为是群众性的工作，必须有坚强的领导。而且这个工作也不是短时期的突击任务，而是长期的工作。
    因此，我认为各企业部门应该建立一个专门机构，来汇集和指导本企业系统的所有带有关键性的先进经验的推广工作。中央的企业管理机构，也应当成立一个专门机构，集中领导这一工作，以便把先进经验及时加以交流与传布。　叶瑞平
