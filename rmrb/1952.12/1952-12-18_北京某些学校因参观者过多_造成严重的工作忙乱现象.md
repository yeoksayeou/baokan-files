    Some Schools in Beijing Suffer From Serious Work Overload Due to Too Many Visitors

    Editor: Recently, many educators from all over the country have come to Beijing to visit, which is undoubtedly of great benefit to the exchange of teaching experience. However, because various regions lack planning when organizing visiting groups, and some visiting groups even fail to make necessary contact with the relevant authorities in Beijing in advance, the workload of administrative cadres and teachers in some middle and primary schools in Beijing has become more serious, causing great difficulties for the Beijing Education Bureau.

    From October 15th to November 30th, in a month and a half, the Beijing Education Bureau received 32 visiting groups, a total of 1,045 people. Among them, 21 visiting groups were visiting primary schools; the content of the visits was almost all about the five-year continuous system of teaching experience, learning from the Soviet experience, and how the school administration should lead, etc. Therefore, the targets of the visits had to be concentrated in a few schools that had achieved relatively good results and experience in these areas. For example, the Second Primary School Attached to Beijing Normal University received 17 visiting groups during this period after being introduced by the Beijing Education Bureau, not including those directly introduced by the Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University, or the China Education Trade Union. Every time someone came to visit, the principal and the director of teaching affairs had to be responsible for the reception, introducing the situation, holding discussions, answering questions, and listening to opinions; many visiting groups also requested to have discussions or individual talks with the director of teaching affairs or outstanding teachers. Mr. Zheng Yun, the director of teaching affairs of the school, had almost no time to study administrative work and teaching work due to receiving visitors.

    Many visiting groups arrive very scattered. In one month, the Beijing Education Bureau had just received the national railway children's school visiting group organized by the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways; but then the visiting group from Qiqihar Railway Children's School and a teacher from the No. 1 Primary School of Xinxiang City Railway Workers' Children in the former Pingyuan Province came to visit separately. Also, seven visiting groups from Zhuozhou County, Tongxian Town, Xingtai, Shunyi, Shijiazhuang, Bozhen, and Hebei Normal School in Hebei Province came to Beijing to visit in a short period of time in a scattered manner. Obviously, this is a major reason for the frequent number of visits.

    Also, many visiting groups come to Beijing without going through a certain organizational system. Schools like Hebei Normal College and Bozhen Normal School even came to Beijing with school introduction letters without going through the local government. Many visiting groups did not contact the competent departments in Beijing in advance, but suddenly came and demanded immediate visits and accommodation, causing great difficulties for the competent departments.

    In order to eliminate this chaotic phenomenon, we hope that the educational administrative departments and schools in various regions will earnestly abide by the regulations of the Ministry of Education, and must go through a certain organizational system when visiting other places, and should obtain the consent of the competent department of the visited area in advance. In addition, we also suggest that the educational leading organs in various regions organize the educators who are going to visit Beijing, in order to reduce the workload of schools in Beijing.

### 北京某些学校因参观者过多  造成严重的工作忙乱现象

    北京某些学校因参观者过多
    造成严重的工作忙乱现象
    编辑同志：最近全国很多地区的教育工作者接连不断地到北京来参观，这对交流教学经验无疑地是有很大好处的。但是，因为各地组织参观团时缺乏计划，甚至有些参观团事先没有和北京市主管单位作必要的联系，以致使北京市某些中、小学行政干部和教师的忙乱现象更加严重，使北京市教育局感到极大困难。
    从十月十五日到十一月三十日一个半月中，北京市教育局先后接待了三十二个参观团，共一千零四十五人。其中二十一个参观团是参观小学的；参观内容几乎都是五年一贯制教学经验，学习苏联的经验及学校行政如何领导等问题。因此，参观的对象就不得不集中到少数对这些工作较有成绩和经验的学校。如北京师范大学第二附属小学在这段期间，先后有十七个参观团经北京市教育局介绍去参观，由教育部、北京师范大学或中国教育工会直接介绍去的还没有计算在内。每次有人来参观时，校长、教导主任要负责招待、介绍情况、举行座谈、解答问题、听取意见；有许多参观团还要求和教导主任或优秀教师进行座谈或个别谈话。该校教导主任郑芸先生因为招待参观，几乎没有时间研究行政工作和教学工作。
    很多参观团来时都是很分散的。在一个月里，北京市教育局刚刚招待过铁道部教育局所组织的全国铁路子弟学校参观团；但接着齐齐哈尔铁路子弟学校的参观团和原平原省新乡市铁路职工子弟小学一校的教员又分别前来参观。又像河北省涿县、通县镇、邢台、顺义、石家庄、泊镇及河北省师范学校等七地参观团在很短时期内分散来北京参观。显然，这是造成参观次数频繁的一个主要原因。
    还有很多参观团到北京来，没有通过一定的组织系统。像河北省师范学院、泊镇师范等校，甚至不通过当地政府就拿了学校介绍信到北京来了。很多参观团事先没和北京市主管部门联系好，突然而来，就要立刻参观和住房，使主管部门感到极大困难。
    为了消除这种混乱现象，我们希望各地教育行政部门和学校切实遵守教育部规定，在到他地参观时必须通过一定组织系统，并应事先取得被参观地区主管部门的同意。此外，我们并建议各地教育领导机关把要来北京参观的教育工作者组织起来，以减少北京市学校忙乱现象。    赵丕杰
