    Strengthening Basic Construction Forces to Welcome Large-Scale Economic Construction
    Zhang Xiushan
    This year, Northeast China has achieved significant results in basic construction. By the end of October, 83.7 percent of the total annual project volume had been completed, and it is expected that the plan will be basically completed before the end of the year. With the completion of basic construction, a basic construction team of approximately 300,000 people has been formed and trained, and preliminary experience in leading basic construction has been gained. This provides a good start for the country's large-scale construction next year.
    This year's basic construction tasks in Northeast China are arduous. The amount of industrial basic construction is more than double that of last year, and the proportion of complex foundation engineering, large metal structure construction, and precision engineering for the installation of large equipment has increased. The task is even more difficult due to insufficient basic construction forces, lack of experience, and especially the late start of construction this year. Therefore, how to quickly organize forces to adapt to the rapidly growing requirements of the task is the primary issue raised in the actual work of basic construction. In order to solve this problem, the Party organizations in Northeast China took some decisive measures with the greatest determination. These are: resolutely transferring cadres from production departments and other units to basic construction positions, establishing and improving basic construction business institutions, establishing political organizations and political work in basic construction departments, organizing the study of advanced Soviet experience, and strengthening the leadership and inspection of basic construction by Party committees at all levels. Of course, this work is still far from adequate and requires further efforts in the future.
    Basic construction is related to the speed of the country's industrialization, the destiny and future of our country, and the improvement of the people's cultural and material living conditions. Therefore, if basic construction is not done well and the development of industry is delayed, it will not only be an economic loss for the country, but more importantly, it will cause political errors. Therefore, based on the basic recovery of industrial production in Northeast China and the continuous growth of basic construction projects, the Party organization in Northeast China clearly raised industrial basic construction to the primary position at the Enlarged Meeting of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in May this year. However, many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of this. For example, they emphasize that cadres from production departments cannot be transferred, believing that "production will collapse if cadres are transferred away." When designated transfers are made, they delay, bargain, and request replacements; or they send the good ones and keep the bad ones, and are even more unwilling to give technical cadres; or they are barely willing to transfer to their own units, but emphasize difficulties when transferring to other departments. For example, they emphasize the importance of their own department's construction, want to strive for more investment, allocate more building materials, and request more cadres, instead of first caring about the key points of national industrial construction and distinguishing between priorities and urgency. In addition, some cadres are blindly optimistic due to a lack of understanding of the complexity of basic construction; and some cadres show helplessness due to overemphasizing objective difficulties, and therefore cannot actively organize forces. This is the first obstacle encountered when implementing the policy of placing industrial basic construction in the primary position. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the truth to the cadres, so that the cadres truly understand the important significance of raising basic construction to the primary position and the guidelines and policies of basic construction, implement the "heavy industry construction first" ideology, overcome egalitarianism and departmentalism, and overcome blind optimism and pessimism. Only when the cadres' understanding is corrected and improved can it be guaranteed that manpower and material resources will be supplied to basic construction first, and in the basic construction departments, they will first be concentrated on key construction departments and important projects of decisive significance. According to the statistics of ten administrative bureaus of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department system in October this year, a total of 9,160 management cadres and technical personnel were transferred to the basic construction departments, of which 2,911 were from the Coal Mining Administration, 2,154 from the Non-Ferrous Metals Administration, and 1,881 from the Machinery Industry Administration; in addition, 2,446 management cadres and technical personnel were transferred to the basic construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. At present, the old cadres and technical personnel in the basic construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are more than twice as many as those in the production departments, and the number of technical personnel has increased more than three times compared with last year.
    With the needs of economic construction development, all departments are lacking cadres, especially the industrial departments. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to transfer cadres, especially technical cadres. However, for the long-term plan, in addition to the great support from the central government and all parts of the country, we ourselves have transferred a batch from production departments and non-production departments, from leading organs, and from university graduates, mainly from production departments using the methods of "designated selection, assigning tasks, complete transfer, and large-scale promotion." For example, of the 9,160 cadres transferred to the basic construction departments of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department system mentioned above, 5,539 were transferred from production; of the 2,446 basic construction cadres transferred to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, about 600 were transferred from production departments. Some comrades doubt: Will such a transfer of cadres affect production? In fact, the question is whether or not we are willing to promote a large number of cadres to supplement them. After the cadres were transferred away from the production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, nearly 2,000 new cadres were promoted, so production not only did not decline, but also the steelmaking open hearth furnace and the ironmaking blast furnace continuously created new records. The total output value of the company in the second quarter exceeded the original plan by 11.7 percent, and the third quarter exceeded it by 5.1 percent. Such a large-scale allocation of basic construction cadres has not only ensured the completion of basic construction tasks, but also trained and promoted a batch of cadres. In the future, we will continue to allocate cadres to the basic construction departments.
    In addition to a large number of cadres, 244,000 construction workers, including many types of work, were invested in basic construction in Northeast China this year. It is not an easy task to organize this group of manual workers who are accustomed to individual labor or only simple cooperative labor (a large part of whom are farmers who have just come out of the countryside) gathered from all directions to engage in complex large-scale construction. The first problem encountered is that most of the workers are mobile, scattered, of complex origin, not highly aware, have strong old habits, and are mostly temporary workers. In individual areas, there are even foremen pretending to be "worker representatives" in the engineering companies. In order to improve the organization, discipline, and awareness of this team, so as to give full play to their labor enthusiasm, improve labor efficiency, and ensure the completion of basic construction, we established trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, and Party organizations in the basic construction departments, carried out political work, and strengthened ideological education and propaganda and mobilization work for employees. In places where there are foremen and the old engineering companies have not been thoroughly reformed, we carried out democratic reforms, eliminated the power of the foremen, changed the company's old leadership methods and leadership style, and cleared out the counter-revolutionaries who had mixed in through individual reviews. In addition, we also organized various necessary and feasible welfare facilities (such as worker canteens, bathhouses, cooperatives, etc.) and organized cultural and recreational activities for employees. In order to strengthen the democratic management of the construction site, we also established a construction site management committee and a employees' representative meeting. The Party organization at the construction site ensures the consistency of the actions of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League and the unified leadership and mutual integration of the various companies in the construction.
    The political work led by the Party is closely integrated with economic work to ensure the completion of tasks in every link, such as preparing for construction, assisting administrative improvement of project management, establishing a responsibility system, implementing piece-rate wages, promoting advanced experience, organizing competitions, and ensuring project progress and quality. However, this work is still not done well enough or universally enough, especially in the design department; secondly, the organizations of the Party and mass organizations in the basic construction departments in various places are still weak, the number of Party members and League members is small, and they have not played their due role. Therefore, during the winter training period, the organizations of the Party and mass organizations need to be consolidated, and a batch of Party members and League members need to be developed to strengthen the guarantee and supervision role of the Party organization.
    An important feature of basic construction this year is the study and promotion of advanced Soviet experience. For example, the implementation of the parallel flow operation method according to the instruction chart can shorten the construction period by about half at the fastest. The result of the implementation by 70 units in the Northeast People's Government Industry Department system is that the construction period is shortened by an average of one-third; the parallel operation of coal mine shaft sinking has increased the monthly progress by 4.7 times, the labor used per square meter has been reduced by 78 percent, and the investment has been saved by 40 percent; the method of installing boilers in sub-assembly has been implemented, and the number of man-hours required is only two-fifths of the old installation method; the mechanical installation has implemented pre-assembly flow operation, which has increased efficiency by two times; the double-handed mud-squeezing bricklaying method has increased efficiency by an average of one time; the rapid drilling method has increased efficiency by three times; in addition, there are design standardization and construction mechanization, factoryization, etc. Due to the promotion of these advanced experiences and the serious implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, on the one hand, the technical level has been improved, the labor organization has been improved, the construction period has been greatly shortened, so that the factory can start production ahead of schedule, the project quality has been guaranteed, manpower and material resources have been saved, and the cost has been reduced. This is a major gain in technology and economy; on the other hand, the most practical political education and ideological transformation work has been carried out, so that employees have further realized the superiority of the socialist system, the sincerity and selflessness of the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese people, and the superb technical level of the Soviet Union, breaking the erroneous views of some people who blindly worship capitalist technology. They sincerely support the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union. Of course, the study and promotion of advanced Soviet experience is still far from enough. Some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of promoting advanced experience, emphasize objective difficulties, or make excuses that construction workers have low awareness, "handicraft industry is backward, and advanced experience cannot be promoted," so the support and organizational leadership for the work of promoting advanced experience are not enough, so the technical level cannot be improved universally. This situation must be changed, and we must resolutely implement learning from the Soviet Union. The effective methods for promoting advanced experience in the past year are to adopt rewards, performances, exhibitions, organize visits, seminars, and run training classes to break the conservative thinking of workers with examples. The promotion of advanced experience must also pay attention to the promotion of experiences with decisive significance, and must persist and not be afraid of failure, because advanced experience is in line with the interests of the working class and will eventually be accepted by all employees. Finally, to do a good job in promoting advanced experience, we must also emphasize the study of leading cadres, because only when the leading cadres themselves understand the content of advanced experience can they effectively and specifically lead the work of promoting advanced experience.
    All of the above measures cannot be implemented without the specific leadership and inspection of the Party. To this end, the Party committees of various provinces and cities in Northeast China have established departments specifically responsible for basic construction work (such as the Basic Construction Political Department (Office) of Anshan and Shenyang, and the Basic Construction Office of Harbin, etc.), and regularly send cadres or work teams to the construction site for inspection; many provincial and municipal Party secretaries personally inspect, understand the situation, organize research, and timely convene basic construction cadre meetings or employees' representative meetings to summarize and deploy work. This specific leadership and inspection has played a major role in ensuring the completion of basic construction tasks.
    In order to welcome the greater basic construction tasks in Northeast China next year (about twice as much as the construction area this year, and more importantly, there will be more complex factory buildings and mine shafts, etc. than this year), it is very important to seize the training of technical workers of various types of work. This winter, the entire Northeast plans to fix tens of thousands of construction workers. In addition to those who are still working in winter, all of them will be trained to further improve their political awareness, so that they can recognize the great significance of national construction, the future of industrialization, and the socialist prospects, and enhance their sense of responsibility as masters; consolidate organizations, establish and improve the political work system, continue to promote activists, and enrich the grass-roots leadership of the basic construction departments (the First Engineering Company alone is preparing to promote 1,000 construction workers and 200 construction site directors); at the same time, learn various advanced operating technical experiences and safe operating experiences according to the type of work. The administrative management personnel and technical personnel of basic construction will conduct a democratic make-up lesson and ideological construction through inspection and summary of this year's basic construction work, and further establish the idea of relying on the working class to comprehensively complete the construction tasks; in the technical personnel, focus on drawing a clear line between the working class and the bourgeois ideology, transform the old technical viewpoints, learn advanced Soviet experience, and establish the idea of combining labor and technology. After this winter training, this basic construction team will be further improved. In addition, for the needs of the country's long-term construction, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of schools that train technical talents and hold various amateur training classes and learning organizations. Prepare
    Batch after batch to be put into the basic construction battle line.
    Although we have formed and trained a basic construction team in the past year, which is of great significance to the country's large-scale construction in the future; however, we must also admit that the number of this team is not enough and the quality is not high enough. Therefore, we must continue to resolutely allocate cadres to the basic construction departments, expand the number of fixed workers, strengthen political work, and vigorously promote advanced Soviet experience. Make this team constantly expand and strengthen, and organize forces to welcome the high tide of large-scale economic construction.

    增强基本建设力量，迎接大规模经济建设
    张秀山
    今年东北的基本建设获得了重大成果：到十月底止，已完成全年工程总量的百分之八十三点七，年前预期可以基本上完成计划。随着基本建设的完成，同时组成和锻炼出了一支约三十余万人的基本建设队伍，并获得了领导基本建设的初步经验。这就为明年国家大规模建设作了一个良好的开端。
    今年东北的基本建设任务是繁重的，工业基本建设的工程量比去年增加了一倍多，而且复杂的基础工程和庞大金属结构的建筑与大型设备安装的精密工程的比重增加。在基本建设力量不足、经验缺乏、尤其是今年动工较晚的情况下，就愈加显得任务的艰巨。因此如何迅速组织力量以适应任务急剧增长的要求，这就是基本建设实际工作当中提出的首要问题。为了解决这个问题，东北地区党的组织以最大决心，进行了一些有决定意义的措施。这就是：坚决从生产部门和其他单位抽调干部派到基本建设岗位上去，建立与健全基本建设的业务机构，建立基本建设部门的政治组织与政治工作，组织学习苏联先进经验，加强各级党委对基本建设的领导和检查。当然这些工作现在做的还很不够，还需今后进一步的努力。
    基本建设关系着国家工业化的速度，关系着我们国家的命运和前途；关系着人民的文化和物质生活条件的改善。所以基本建设如果搞不好，使工业的发展推迟，不仅是国家经济上的损失，更重要的是将造成政治错误。因此东北地区党的组织根据东北工业生产已基本恢复和基本建设工程不断增长情况，在今年五月中共中央东北局扩大会议上，就把经济建设中的工业基本建设，明确地提到了首要地位。但有不少干部对此认识不足，比如：强调生产部门的干部不能调，认为“调走干部、生产要垮台”；当指名抽调时，就拖时间、讲价钱、要求更换；或者是留好的送次的，更不愿给技术干部；或者是调给本单位还勉强愿意，调给其他部门就强调困难。又如：强调本部门建设的重要，要争取多投资，多拨给建筑器材，要求多派干部，而不是首先关心国家工业建设的重点，分不清轻重缓急。另外还有些干部由于对基本建设的复杂性认识不清，而盲目乐观；也还有干部由于过分强调客观困难，而表现了束手无策，因而都不能积极去组织力量。这就是在贯彻将工业基本建设放在首要地位的方针时首先遇到的阻碍。因此必须反覆地向干部讲清道理，使干部真正懂得把基本建设提到首要地位的重要意义和基本建设的方针政策，贯彻“重工业建设第一”的思想，克服平均主义和本位主义思想，克服盲目乐观与悲观失望情绪。当干部的认识被端正和提高之后，才能够保证把人力、物力首先供给基本建设，而在基本建设部门又首先有重点的集中使用于重点建设部门和有决定意义的重要工程上去。据今年十月份东北人民政府工业部系统十个管理局的统计，调给基本建设部门的管理干部和技术人员共达九一六○名，其中煤矿管理局即为二九一一名，有色金属管理局为二一五四名，机械工业管理局为一八八一名；另外调到鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门的管理干部和技术人员为二四四六名。目前鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门的老干部和技术人员已比生产部门的多两倍以上，其中技术人员比去年增加了三倍还多。
    随着经济建设发展的需要，各部门的干部都很缺乏，而工业部门尤其不足。在这种情况下，抽调干部特别是技术干部是有困难的。但是为了百年大计，除中央和全国各地给了我们以很大的支援外，我们自己又从生产部门和非生产部门、从领导机关、从大学毕业生中抽调了一批，其中主要的又是从生产部门用“指名要、派任务、成套调、大量提”的办法抽调了大批干部。比如前述东北人民政府工业部系统调到基本建设部门的九一六○名干部中，从生产中抽调的即有五五三九名；调到鞍山钢铁公司的二四四六名基本建设干部中，约六百名是从生产部门调来的。有的同志怀疑：这样抽调干部会不会影响生产呢？其实，问题在于愿不愿意大量提拔干部来补充。鞍山钢铁公司的生产部门，在干部调走之后，又提拔了近两千名新干部，因此生产不但没有下降，而且炼钢平炉和炼铁高炉不断地创造了新纪录，全公司第二季度生产总值超过原计划百分之十一点七，第三季度又超过了百分之五点一。这样大批调配基本建设干部，既保证了基本建设任务的完成，同时又训练提拔了一批干部。今后还要继续向基本建设部门调配干部。
    今年东北投入基本建设当中的除大批干部而外，还有二十四万四千包括许多工种的建筑工人。要组织这批从四面八方凑集来的习惯于单独劳动或仅有简单协力劳动的手工工人（有很大一部分是才从农村出来的农民），来从事复杂的大规模的建筑，这也不是一件简易的工作，首先碰到的问题是：大部分工人的流动，分散，来源复杂，觉悟不高，旧习气浓厚，又多为临时工，个别地区的工程公司当中甚至还有冒充“工人代表”的把头把持。为了提高这支队伍的组织性、纪律性和觉悟性，以发挥他们的劳动热情，提高劳动效率，保证基本建设的完成，我们在基本建设部门建立了工会、青年团和党的组织，进行了政治工作，加强了对职工的思想教育和宣传鼓动工作。在有把头把持和旧工程公司改造不彻底的地方，进行了民主改革，消除了把头势力，改变了公司的旧的领导方法和领导作风，又通过个别审查的方式，清除了混进来的反革命分子。此外又举办了各种必需而又可行的福利设施（如工人食堂、澡堂、合作社等），组织了职工的文化娱乐活动。为了加强工地的民主管理，又成立了工地管理委员会和职工代表会议。工地党的组织，则保证了党、政、工、团行动的一致和各公司在施工中的统一领导与互相结合。
    党所领导的政治工作紧密地与经济工作相结合，保证了每个环节任务的完成，如准备开工，协助行政改进工程管理，建立责任制，推行计件工资，推广先进经验，组织竞赛，保证工程进度和质量等。不过，这些工作都还做得不够好，不够普遍，尤其是在设计部门做得更差；其次，现在各地基本建设部门的党和群众团体的组织都还薄弱，党员团员的数量很少，尚未起到应有的作用。因此需要在今冬训练期间，将党和群众团体的组织加以整顿，发展一批党员，团员，以加强党组织的保证与监督作用。
    今年基本建设中的一个重要特点，是对苏联先进经验的学习和推广。如按指示图表平行流水作业法的实行，最快的能缩短工期约一半，东北人民政府工业部系统七十个单位实行的结果，平均缩短工期三分之一；煤矿竖井打井筒的平行作业，每月进度提高了四点七倍，每平方米所用人工减少了百分之七十八，节省投资百分之四十；实行了分部组合安装锅炉法，所需的工数仅为旧式安装法的五分之二；机械安装实行了预装配流水作业，提高效率两倍；实行双手挤浆砌砖法，平均提高效率一倍；快速钻探法提高了效率三倍；此外还有设计标准化和施工的机械化、工厂化等等。由于这些先进经验的推广和对苏联专家建议的认真执行，一方面提高了技术水平，改进了劳动组织，大大缩短了工期，使工厂可以提前开工生产，保证了工程质量，节省了人力物力，降低了成本，这在技术上经济上是个重大收获；另一方面又进行了最实际的政治教育和思想改造工作，使职工更进一步认识了社会主义制度的优越，苏联对中国人民援助的真诚无私，苏联技术水平的高超，打破了某些人对资本主义技术盲目崇拜的错误观点，他们真诚地拥护苏联，向苏联学习。当然现在对苏联先进经验的学习与推广还很不够。有些同志对推广先进经验的意义认识不足，强调客观困难，或藉口建筑工人觉悟低，“手工业就是落后的，先进经验不能推广”，于是对推广先进经验工作的支持和组织领导不够，因而还不能普遍地提高技术水平。这种情况必须改变，必须坚决贯彻向苏联学习。一年来推广先进经验的有效方法，是采取奖励、表演、展览、组织参观、座谈、办训练班，用实例打破工人的保守思想。推广先进经验又必须注意推广带有决定意义的经验，必须坚持，不怕失败，因为先进经验是符合工人阶级的利益的，最终必为全体职工所接受。最后要做好推广先进经验的工作，还必须强调领导干部的学习，因为只有首先使领导干部自己弄明白先进经验的内容，才能对推广先进经验的工作进行有效地具体地领导。
    所有上述一切措施，没有党的具体领导和检查，就无法贯彻。为此，东北各省市党委均设立了专门掌握基本建设工作的部门（如鞍山、沈阳的基本建设政治部（处），哈尔滨的基本建设处等），并经常派干部或工作组到工地去检查；不少省市委书记均亲自检查，了解情况，组织研究，及时召开基本建设干部会议或职工代表会议，总结和布置工作。这种具体的领导和检查，对保证基本建设任务的完成，起了重大的作用。
    为了迎接明年东北更大的基本建设任务（约等于今年建筑面积的二倍还多，更重要的是有了比今年更多的复杂的厂房和矿井等的建设）抓紧培养各工种的技术工人非常重要。今冬全东北计划再固定数万建筑工人，除冬季仍在作业者外，全部加以训练，进一步提高其政治觉悟，使之认清祖国建设的伟大意义、工业化的前途和社会主义远景，增强其主人翁的责任感；整顿组织，建立与健全政治工作制度，继续提拔积极分子，充实基本建设部门的基层领导力量（仅第一工程公司即准备提拔一千名施工员和二百名工地主任）；同时按照工种学习各种先进操作技术经验和安全作业经验。基本建设的行政管理人员和技术人员，则通过检查和总结今年的基本建设工作，进行一次民主补课和思想建设，进一步树立依靠工人阶级，全面完成建设任务的思想；在技术人员中着重划清工人阶级与资产阶级思想界限，改造旧的技术观点，学习苏联先进经验，树立劳动与技术相结合的思想。经过这次冬季训练，将把这支基本建设队伍再提高一步。此外为了国家长远建设的需要，还必须加强对培养技术人材的学校的领导，举办各种业余的训练班和学习组织。准备
    一批一批地投入基本建设战线上去。
    一年来我们虽然组成和锻炼了一支基本建设队伍，这对今后国家大规模建设，具有重大意义；但是，我们也必须承认这支队伍的数量还不够，质量也还不高。因此，必须继续坚决地向基本建设部门调配干部，并扩大固定工人数量，加强政治工作，大力推广苏联先进经验。使这支队伍不断地扩大和坚强，为迎接大规模经济建设高潮而组织好力量。
