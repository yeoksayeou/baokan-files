    Xiyang Village Cooperative Credit Department Eliminates Local Usury
    People's Bank of China, Yongji County Branch
    Xiyang Village in Yongji County, Jilin Province, consists of eleven natural villages, with a total of 986 households, 4,398 people, and 1,859 *xiang* of land. The Xiyang Village Cooperative established a credit department in January 1950, and its business began to develop in the spring of the following year. In 1951, 564 households deposited money in this credit department, with a deposit amount (including the value of goods) of 198.16 million yuan, an increase of 330 percent compared to 1950. The loan amount in 1951 was 145.49 million yuan, with 922 borrowers. These loans solved many difficulties for the farmers. Last year, the village suffered from hailstorms, floods, frost, and other disasters, and the crops on more than 300 *xiang* of land were completely destroyed. The cooperative credit department issued loans, enabling 203 affected households to purchase seeds such as buckwheat, early millet, kidney beans, and radishes, and replant more than 130 *xiang* of land, helping them overcome the disaster and boosting the morale of the masses. Although there were disasters last year, this year, 108 households continued to deposit fixed-term, current, and in-kind deposits, with a total deposit amount of 53.75 million yuan. By the end of May, a total of 70.61 million yuan in loans had been issued, solving the problems of lacking farm tools, feed (soybean cake), livestock, carts, seeds, and food for a group of farmers. It supported 30 percent of the poor farmers in the village, enabling them to avoid bankruptcy under the attack of the disaster.
    The Xiyang Village Cooperative Credit Department has gained several experiences in its operations since its establishment:
    1.  The deposit and loan process must follow the mass line. Initially, the deposit and loan procedures of this credit department were not sound. The village chief could issue a letter of introduction to the credit department to obtain a loan. Some farmers who already had two cattle wanted to borrow money to buy horses and rent them out for profit. As a result, there were many borrowers, and the credit department's funds could not meet the demand. Later, it was decided that the loan procedure would be based on individual application and group evaluation. Groups could also offer opinions on applicants, and the credit department would make the final approval. The masses strongly supported the credit department's approach. The credit department was able to make reasonable loans and expand deposits.
    2.  For in-kind deposits, it is necessary to "determine receipts based on sales and deposits based on loans." Initially, this credit department accepted all in-kind deposits regardless of whether they were short-term or long-term, which caused many problems that could not be solved. Later, it adopted the method of "register first, find sales channels, no loans, no interest, no sales channels, no acceptance for the time being." It also closely integrated with the supply and marketing cooperative to solve the problem of sales channels for stored goods. For example, some members wanted to deposit live pigs, so they first registered with the credit department. The credit department actively found people willing to borrow live pigs, based on the principle of mutual benefit for both the depositor and the borrower, and negotiated with both parties to calculate the deposit and loan interest according to the regulations of the credit department. For example, if some members wanted to sell pigs, the supply and marketing cooperative helped promote the sales, and after the members sold the pigs, they deposited the money into the credit department (the same as current deposits). The members' problems were solved, and the credit department absorbed a sum of current deposits for future use.
    3.  Eliminate usury and strive to attract usurious capital as deposits. Before the establishment of the credit department, 89 households in the village borrowed usurious loans with interest rates of 50 percent or more. Both borrowers and lenders agreed not to disclose this to the public, which was actually a semi-public and semi-secret activity. After the establishment of the credit department, publicity was immediately launched, explaining that the cooperative credit department had funds that could be lent to farmers in need, with very low interest rates, and hoping that everyone would no longer borrow usurious loans. This cut off the outlet for usurious funds. At the same time, patient propaganda was carried out directly or indirectly to usurious households, explaining that in the new society, there should be unity and mutual assistance, and there should be no usurious exploitation. If they had funds, they should deposit them in the credit department, which could generate interest and be easily withdrawn. In this way, usurious funds were gradually absorbed as credit department deposits. After more than two years of work, the village has completely eliminated usury.
    4.  For farmers whose economic situation is declining, it is necessary to specifically analyze the reasons for the decline, and then find ways to help them; the loan amount should be small, but the effect should be great, so that it is easy to repay. Member Liu Wancai's life had not improved after several years of production campaigns, and he had a downward trend due to the disaster. The credit department analyzed his situation, believing that his family had a large population and weak labor force, and some people could not work in the fields, but they could raise pigs, so they lent him pigs. After three months of feeding, his family's income increased significantly.
    5.  Actively create sideline opportunities for farmers. Last winter, due to the disaster suffered by farmers, in addition to mobilizing male workers to work in the nursery, the credit department also organized more than 100 women to spin thread and weave sacks based on the situation at the time, which solved the difficulties in farmers' lives.
    6.  Pay attention to absorbing small deposits. Among the rural working people, especially the elderly, women, young people, and children, often engage in certain sideline labor, such as weaving mats, raising chickens, and raising pigs. Part or all of these small amounts of income belong to individuals and not to the family. The credit department conducted different publicity according to different targets to mobilize them to deposit in the credit department.
    From the experience of more than two years, organizing farmers' own funds, giving play to the role of farmers' potential capital, and promoting the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship among farmers can solve some of the difficulties of farmers. The cooperative credit department or credit cooperative does not require the state bank to supply a large amount of funds, but requires specific leadership, requires help in summarizing experience, and improving work efficiency. In this way, the cooperative credit department will be consolidated and developed. Of course, at the beginning of the establishment, the masses did not trust the credit department and did not dare to deposit money. It was necessary for the bank to lend some money to provide temporary support. For example, the Xiyang Village Cooperative Credit Department initially borrowed some money from the bank, and the masses responded one after another, saying: The credit department can still borrow money from the bank. The credit of the credit department was immediately improved.
    Why can the Xiyang Village Cooperative Credit Department achieve these results? First of all, the local party and government officials in charge attach great importance to the credit department and often provide effective help, especially continuously educating and improving the leading cadres of the credit department, encouraging their enthusiasm for work, and making them become cadres who can connect with the masses, study business, and be pure and simple in their work.
    Secondly, the business of the credit department and the supply and marketing cooperative are closely integrated, and a correct capital exchange relationship has been established. However, the capital exchanges between the credit and supply and marketing departments must be clearly divided, and interest should be paid on deposits and loans according to regulations. The main deposit and loan target of the credit department is the farmers, that is, absorbing the deposits of the farmers to solve the difficulties of the farmers. If there is surplus money beyond meeting the requirements of the farmers, it can be lent to the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative should help the credit department handle the problem of storing goods. The supply and marketing cooperative supports the credit department, which also creates conditions for the supply and marketing business. The leaders of the credit department often go deep into the countryside to understand the economic situation of farmers in order to absorb deposits, and combine with the rural sales group of the supply and marketing cooperative to promote the stagnant goods of farmers, which also increases the source of deposits.
    Finally, the leadership and support of the state bank in financial policy and business is also an important factor in consolidating the foundation of the credit department and quickly developing its business.

    西阳村合作社信用部消灭了当地的高利贷
    中国人民银行永吉县支行
    吉林省永吉县西阳村包括十一个自然屯，共有九八六户，四三九八人，土地一八五九垧。西阳村合作社于一九五○年一月成立了信用部，到次年的春天，它的业务就开展起来了。一九五一年有五六四户在这个信用部存款，存入金额（包括实物折价）一亿九千八百一十六万元，比一九五○年增加了百分之三百三十。一九五一年的贷款额是一亿四千五百四十九万元，贷款者有九二二户。这些贷款替农民解决了不少困难。去年该村遭受雹灾、水灾、霜灾等灾害，约有三百多垧地的庄稼全无收成。合作社信用部发放贷款，使受灾的二○三户购入了荞麦、早谷、小豆、萝卜等种籽，补种了一百三十多垧地，帮助他们克服了灾荒，提高了群众的生产情绪。去年虽有灾荒，今年还继续吸收了定期、活期及实物存户一○八户，存款总额五千三百七十五万元。至五月末共放出贷款七千零六十一万元，替一批农民解决了缺乏农具、马料（豆饼）、牲口、大车、种籽、口粮等困难问题。扶持了全村百分之三十的贫苦农户，使他们在灾荒袭击下免于破产。
    西阳村合作社信用部成立以来，在业务上取得几点经验：
    一、存放款要走群众路线。起初，这个信用部的存放款手续很不健全，村长开个介绍信给信用部，就能取得贷款。有的农民有了两条牛，还想贷款买马，出租赚钱。结果借款人多，信用部的款供不应求。后来决定，放款手续采取个人申请，小组评定的办法。组与组之间，对申请放款者也可提出意见，最后由信用部批准。群众很拥护信用部的作法。信用部能够合理的贷款，而且扩大了存款。
    二、对于实物存款要“以销定收，以贷定存”。这个信用部起初对实物存款，不分长短期一律吸收，结果问题很多，解决不了。后来对实物存款采取“先登记、找销路，不贷出、不生息，无销路、暂不收”的办法；又和供销社密切结合，解决了收存实物的销路问题。例如：有些社员要存活猪，就先到信用部登记，信用部积极找到愿借活猪的人，本存借两利的原则，和双方商定，由存借双方各按信用部的规定，计算存放利息。又如，有的社员要卖猪，供销社帮助推销，社员卖猪后将款存入信用部（与活期存款同）。社员的问题解决了，信用部又吸收了一笔待用的活期存款。
    三、消灭高利贷，并争取高利贷资本作存款。信用部没有成立以前，该村有八十九户借了五分利以上的高利贷，借贷双方都约定对外不公开，其实是一种半公开半秘密的活动。信用部成立后，立即展开宣传，说明合作社信用部有款可以贷给需款的农民，利息很低，希望大家不要再借高利贷。这样就把高利贷的资金出路截断了。同时又直接或间接地向高利贷户耐心宣传，说明新社会里要团结互助，不应有高利贷的剥削行为，有款应该存入信用部，可以生息而且提取方便。这样就逐渐把高利贷资金吸收为信用部存款了。该村经过两年多的工作，已经彻底消灭了高利贷。
    四、对于经济下降的农户，要具体分析其下降的原因，然后再替他想办法；贷款要金额小，作用大，这样偿还也容易。社员刘万才经过几年来的生产运动，生活没有上升，受到灾荒袭击，反有下降的趋势。信用部分析了他的情况，认为他家人口多，劳动力弱，有部分人不能下地，但还可以养猪，于是就借给他猪。喂养三个月后，他家就增加了不少收入。
    五、主动给农民创造副业条件。去年冬天，因农民受灾，信用部除动员男工上苗圃作工外，又根据当时情况，组织了一百多妇女纺线织麻袋，解决了农民生活的困难。
    六、注意吸收小额存款。农村劳动人民中，特别是老年人、妇女、青年、小孩，往往从事若干副业劳动，如编席、养鸡、养猪等，这些小额收入的一部或全部，归个人不归家庭。信用部即根据这种情况，按不同的对象，进行不同的宣传，动员他们到信用部存款。
    从二年多来的经验看，组织农民自己的资金，发挥农民潜在资力的作用，发扬农民团结、互助、友爱的精神，是可以解决农民的若干困难的。合作社信用部或信用合作社并不要求国家银行大量供给资金，但是要求具体领导，要求帮助总结经验，提高工作效率。这样，合作社信用部就会巩固和发展。当然在初办时，群众对信用部还不信任，有钱不敢存入，需要银行贷些款暂时给予支持。如西阳村合作社信用部最初在银行借回一部分钱，群众纷纷反映说：信用部还能在银行借出款来。信用部的信用立时就提高了。
    为什么西阳村合作社信用部能取得这些成绩呢？首先是当地党政负责干部对信用部十分重视，经常给以有效的帮助，特别是对信用部的领导干部不断教育提高，鼓励他们的工作热情，使他们在工作中锻炼成为能够联系群众、钻研业务、纯洁朴素的干部。
    其次，信用部和供销社的业务密切结合，建立了正确的资金往来关系。但信用和供销部门在资金往来上必须划分清楚，存借都应按照规定付给利息。信用部的主要存贷对象是农民群众，即吸收农民群众的存款来解决农民群众的困难，如果满足农民群众要求之外还有剩款，可以贷给供销社。供销社应该帮助信用部处理存实问题。供销社支持信用部，也就给供销事业创造了条件。该信用部的领导者经常深入农村，了解农民经济情况，以便吸收存款，并结合供销社的农村推销组，大量推销农民的滞销实物，也增加了存款的来源。
    最后，国家银行在金融政策上和业务上的领导和支持，也是使信用部的基础获得巩固，业务很快得到开展的重要因素。
