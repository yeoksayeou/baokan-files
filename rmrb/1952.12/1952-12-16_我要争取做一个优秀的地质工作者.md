    I Want to Strive to Be an Excellent Geological Worker
    Comrade Editor: I am a student at the Beijing Geological Institute. When I saw the news in the People's Daily that the state would begin large-scale basic construction and that the Beijing Geological Institute, the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and other schools were opening, I was extremely happy. I deeply realized how urgently the Party, the motherland, and the people need us! I am proud to be able to study in such a new type of university. When I applied to the Geological Institute, I only knew that the motherland needed cadres in this area very much, but I didn't know the importance of geological work in the country's economic construction. After a period of study, especially after listening to the reports of Minister Li Siguang and Vice Minister He Changgong of the Ministry of Geology, I further realized that geological work is closely linked with the prosperity and happiness of our great motherland. At the same time, this also made me feel the importance of our responsibility. I am determined to dedicate my youth and all my energy to the young geological cause of the motherland. For the motherland, for Chairman Mao, I will study tirelessly and strive to be an excellent geological worker.    Wang Wei

    我要争取做一个优秀的地质工作者
    编辑同志：我是北京地质学院的学生。当我在人民日报上看到国家将开始大规模的基本建设和北京地质学院、中南矿冶学院等校开学等消息时，我高兴极了。我深深地意识到党、祖国、人民是怎样迫切地需要着我们啊！我为自己能在这样一所新型的大学里学习而骄傲。我投考地质学院时，只知道祖国很需要这一方面的干部，但不知道地质事业在国家经济建设中的重要性。经过一个时期的学习，特别是听了中央地质部李四光部长和何长工副部长的报告后，我才进一步认识到地质事业是和我们伟大祖国的繁荣、幸福密切地结合在一起的。同时这也使我感觉到我们责任的重大。我决心将我的青春和我全部的精力献给祖国年轻的地质事业。为了祖国，为了毛主席，我要不懈地学习，争取做一名优秀的地质工作者。    王玮
