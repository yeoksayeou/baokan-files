Under the direct design and specific guidance of Soviet steelmaking experts, the project of converting the pre-refining furnaces into open hearth furnaces at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant has been successfully completed. The steelmaking situation in the converted open hearth furnace is good. The first converted open hearth furnace set a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in 7 hours and 58 minutes on November 15; the second converted open hearth furnace also averaged only 10 hours and 40 minutes on the 15th and 16th.

The pre-refining furnace is a processing equipment used to reduce the silicon content in molten iron before steelmaking. After the successful production of low-silicon iron by the ironmaking plant in 1951, the molten iron no longer needs to be refined in the pre-furnace and can be directly sent to the open hearth furnace for steelmaking. In order to utilize this equipment, Soviet experts proposed the suggestion of converting the pre-refining furnace into an open hearth furnace. After a long period of design, testing, and conversion, the first converted open hearth furnace officially started steelmaking in September this year, and the second converted open hearth furnace was also completed in early November and officially started steelmaking on the 15th. The conversion project only cost a small amount of money and involved minor engineering reforms, which added two large steelmaking open hearth furnaces to the steelmaking plant. This is a major contribution made by Soviet experts to the rapid development of China's steel industry.

    鞍山钢铁公司
    改预备精炼炉为炼钢平炉
    在苏联炼钢专家的直接设计和具体指导下，国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂改预备精炼炉为炼钢平炉的工程已告成功。改装后的平炉炼钢情况良好。第一个改装的平炉在十一月十五日出现过七点五十八分炼一炉钢的新纪录；第二个改装的平炉在十五和十六两日也平均只用了十点四十分钟。
    预备精炼炉是在炼钢前为了降低铁水中含矽成分的加工设备。一九五一年炼铁厂制炼低矽铁成功后，铁水不必再经预备炉精炼就可以直接送入平炉炼钢。为了利用这一设备，苏联专家提出了改预备精炼炉为炼钢平炉的建议。经过长期的设计试验与改装，第一个改装的平炉已在今年九月正式开始炼钢，第二个改装的平炉也在今年十一月初完工，并在十五日正式炼钢。改装工程只花费了很少的资金，和进行了微小的工程改革，就使炼钢厂增加了两座大型的炼钢平炉。这是苏联专家在为迅速发展我国钢铁工业中的一大贡献。
