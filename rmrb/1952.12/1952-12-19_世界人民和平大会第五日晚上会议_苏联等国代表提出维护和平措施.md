Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17th: The World People's Peace Congress held a meeting on the evening of December 16th, chaired by Korean representative Han Xueye.

    Japanese representative Kinoshita Kenta stressed in his speech that the Korean War has extremely serious consequences for the Japanese people. Japanese industry is now entirely geared towards war production; electricity and coal are primarily supplied to munitions factories rather than factories producing civilian goods; and Japanese transportation is being used for military transport. American planes, damaged over Korea and unable to return to base, often crash on Japanese territory. Since the start of the war, Japanese workers, under the supervision of armed American soldiers, have been manufacturing bacteriological weapons, napalm bombs, tanks, and so on. American soldiers are running rampant in Japanese cities.

    Kinoshita Kenta exposed the conspiracy of American war instigators and Japanese militarists who are attempting to instill hatred of the heroic Korean people into the minds of the broad masses of the Japanese people. He said that there is an old saying in Japan: "People living on the same street are close friends." Indivisible friendly relations link the Japanese and Korean people together, and the Japanese people will never fight against the Korean people. Kinoshita Kenta concluded by saying, we do not want to serve the war instigators. Strong evidence of this is that 3.5 million Japanese people have signed petitions against remilitarization and the implementation of compulsory conscription. In our daily lives, we Japanese deeply feel the threat posed by the Korean War, and therefore we appeal to all kind people in the world to demand an immediate end to the Korean War, the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, atomic bombs and other weapons of mass slaughter, and the cessation of all wars currently being waged!

    The next speaker was Rosa Hillerbrand, a member of the German Social Democratic Party.

    She stressed that the division of Germany was caused by those who profit from international tensions, and this division only benefits the war forces within Germany. Currently, 50 million people in West Germany are at the mercy of those who once funded Hitler, helped him seize power, and supported the world war he launched. She suggested that the Congress establish an international committee to study all actions that could lead to new European and world wars. This committee should publish its findings to the people of the world.

    Hillerbrand concluded by requesting the Congress to formulate a constructive solution to the German question, and to support the convening of a meeting of representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France to seek progress on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with a unified Germany and withdrawing occupying forces.

    Following this, the Congress read a telegram from British Member of Parliament S.O. Davies to Professor Joliot-Curie. The telegram wished the Congress success in its work of seeking peace and international friendship.

    Then, British Professor Bernal gave a speech on "The Question of Easing International Tensions."

    Following Professor Bernal, Soviet writer Korneichuk spoke. He conveyed the greetings of Soviet peace advocates to the Congress. He said that we would be making an unforgivable mistake if we underestimate the importance of war propaganda that hates mankind. The war instigators say that the Soviet Union has made the people of various countries bear the unbearable burden of expanding armaments, and they insist that the Soviet Union threatens Europe and the United States with its ideology and its army. If the Soviet Union were truly preparing for war, how could it be carrying out peaceful construction of huge irrigation systems, which have begun to turn millions of hectares of desert and barren land into lush gardens? How could it be building huge locks on the Volga, Don, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers, and digging new seas and navigable canals? The Soviet people are firmly opposed to war because our entire society is inseparable from peace.

    Korneichuk continued: As a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, I am very proud to have participated in the Supreme Soviet's passage of the Law on the Protection of Peace on March 12, 1951. I sincerely hope that the American people will enact such a law as soon as possible, and I hope that this well-intentioned and friendly wish will not be seen as interference in the internal affairs of the United States (applause).

    Korneichuk said that the Soviet people have always advocated and will continue to advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and all other weapons of mass destruction; they have always advocated and will continue to advocate that the five major powers gradually and simultaneously reduce conventional armaments and armed forces by one-third to one-half, and establish strict international control to supervise the implementation of the above prohibitions and the reduction of various overt and covert weapons.

    Korneichuk said: I would like to assure you that we will pay great attention and give heartfelt support to any peace initiative, no matter where it is proposed. Korneichuk spoke specifically about the issue of a peace pact. He said: The entire Soviet people have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. At this congress, we must try to make the governments of the five major powers—the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, and France—aware of the wishes of the 600 million people who have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact, as well as the wishes of our congress. He said: I also agree with the views of many representatives who have spoken here that we must wage a resolute struggle to make the United Nations a true instrument of international peace and cooperation.

    Korneichuk said: I would like to talk about two plans put forward by politicians in different countries. Mr. Eisenhower said at the Republican rally in Philadelphia on September 4, 1952: America's creativity, imagination, and production plans have once again turned to war and the prospects of war, its economy is a war economy, and its prosperity is the prosperity of war.

    We see what this prospect means for the Korean people. The people of the world will never forget the unspeakable suffering endured by the ravaged and heroic Korea. We know very well what this prospect means for the people of the whole world—including the American people.

    But there is another prospect. This is a prospect put forward by G.M. Malenkov—one of the most outstanding Soviet leaders—and wholeheartedly accepted by the Soviet people. There now exists the prospect of maintaining peace, the prospect of peace among the peoples of various countries, a prospect that requires compliance with the resolutions passed by the United Nations, the prohibition of war propaganda, the prohibition of atomic and bacteriological weapons, the gradual reduction of the armed forces of major powers, the conclusion of a peace pact among major powers, the expansion of international trade, the restoration of a unified international market, and other similar measures in the spirit of strengthening peace. Taking these measures will strengthen peace, will rid the people of various countries of the fear of the danger of war, will end the unprecedented material consumption on expanding armaments and preparing for destructive wars, and will make it possible to divert these materials to the welfare of the people.

    Korneichuk said that the Soviet Union advocates taking these measures, advocates the prospect of international peace.

    Then all the delegates stood up and applauded and cheered the Soviet representative for several minutes.

    Belgian representative Cavénillé then spoke, addressing the issue of national independence.

    He spoke about the legal aspects of the Schuman Plan and the European Defense Community Treaty. He pointed out: By signing these treaties, which violate the Belgian Constitution, Belgium is embarking on the path of selling out its national sovereignty and independence, and the Belgian people are losing the right to determine their own destiny. After signing these treaties and shifting the country's economy to a war footing, Belgium's economic situation has deteriorated even further.

    Cavénillé concluded by pointing out: The United Nations Charter and some diplomatic treaties that lead to a new world war are incompatible. He said: Now Belgium should rise up against the policy that violates its traditions, violates its international obligations, and compromises its dignity as a civilized nation.

    The Congress then read a congratulatory telegram from Iran's prominent religious leader, Kashani. In his congratulatory telegram to the Congress, he wrote: The number of peace advocates in countries around the world is increasing day by day. He pointed out: Unjust wars are causing suffering to the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. The telegram said: I hope this bloodshed will not continue. I have decided to warn the youth. I ask the representatives of the World People's Peace Congress to take resolute action to defend world peace.

    Norwegian representative Pastor Fåbecc made a brief speech. He said that the Norwegian people have increasingly realized that Norway's joining the Atlantic Pact was a mistake. Now a movement advocating neutrality is unfolding in Norway, and the number of peace advocates is increasing day by day, and they believe that their struggle is not in vain. Finally, he asked the Congress to unite all forces to strive for peace.

    The next speaker was Ahmad Shariat-Zadeh, head of the Iranian delegation, who spoke specifically about the issue of national independence. Shariat-Zadeh talked about the serious consequences of the two world wars for Iran. He said that the First World War consolidated British imperialism's rule over our country, while the Second World War brought American imperialism's rule; American imperialism not only tried its best to seize Iran's national wealth, but also tried its best to make Iran politically and economically subordinate, so as to use its resources and territory to prepare for a third world war against its neighbor, the Soviet Union.

    Shariat-Zadeh also talked about the struggle to recover the Iranian oil resources seized by British imperialism, a struggle that is inseparable from the overall struggle of the Iranian people for national independence. The Iranian people know that their struggle for national independence must be carried out simultaneously with the struggle to stop the current war.

    Shariat-Zadeh finally called for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers—a pact that will become a true charter for the people of the world. The Iranian delegation supports the suggestion that the Congress pass an appeal to the governments of the five major powers, asking them to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the people of various countries and to guarantee the security and independence of the people of all countries around the world.

    The last speakers at the evening session were Israeli representative Bantov and Ecuadorian representative Enrique Adoum.

    世界人民和平大会第五日晚上会议
    苏联等国代表提出维护和平措施
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社维也纳十七日讯：世界人民和平大会在十二月十六日晚上举行会议，由朝鲜代表韩雪野担任主席。
    日本代表金子健太在他的发言中着重指出，朝鲜战争对于日本人民有极端严重的后果。日本工业现在完全是为战争而生产；电力和煤首先要供给军火厂使用，而不是供给生产民用品的工厂使用；日本交通工具则被用来进行军事运输。在朝鲜上空被击伤不能飞返基地的美国飞机常常撞毁在日本领土上。自从战争开始以来，日本工人在武装的美国士兵监督下一直在制造细菌武器、凝固汽油弹、坦克等等。美国士兵在日本城市中胡作非为。
    金子健太揭露美国战争制造者和日本军国主义分子的阴谋，他们企图把仇恨英勇的朝鲜人民的思想灌输到广大日本人民群众的思想中。他说，日本有
    一句古语说：“住在一条街上的人是亲密的朋友”。不能分割的友好关系把日本人民和朝鲜人民连结在一起，日本人民决不对朝鲜人民作战。金子健太最后说，我们不愿为战争制造者服务。这一点的有力证明是，三百五十万日本人在反对重新军国主义化和实施强迫军役制的抗议书上签了名。在我们的日常生活中，我们日本人深深感到朝鲜战争所带来的威胁，因此我们向世界上一切善良的人们呼吁，要求立即停止朝鲜战争，禁止细菌武器、原子弹及其他大规模屠杀的武器，停止现在进行的一切战争！
    接着发言的是德国社会民主党议员罗沙·希勒布兰德。
    她着重指出，德国的分裂是由那些靠国际紧张局势发财的人造成的，这种分裂局面只有利于德国国内的战争势力。目前，西德五千万人民正听任曾经资助过希特勒，帮助他夺取政权并支持他所发动的世界大战的人摆布。她建议大会成立一个国际委员会，研究一切可能引起新的欧洲战争和世界战争的行动。这个委员会应把研究结果向世界人民公布。
    希勒布兰德最后要求大会拟订一个建设性的和平解决德国问题的办法，并支持召开美苏英法四国代表会议，以求在与统一的德国缔结和约及撤退占领军的问题上获得进展。
    接着，大会宣读了英国议员斯·奥·戴维斯致约里奥—居里教授的电报。电报祝大会的谋求和平与国际友谊的工作获得成功。
    然后，英国贝尔纳教授就“缓和国际紧张局势问题”发表演说。
    在贝尔纳教授之后发言的是苏联作家考涅楚克。他代表苏联的和平拥护者向大会致敬。他说，如果我们低估仇恨人类的战争宣传的重要性，我们就犯了无法挽救的错误。战争制造者说是苏联使得各国人民负荷令人无法忍受的扩张军备的赋税重担，他们硬说苏联以它的思想和军队威胁着欧洲和美国。如果苏联真正在准备战争，它怎么还能够进行建设庞大的灌溉系统的和平建设，这种建设已经开始把数百万公顷的沙漠和不毛之地变成了繁茂的花园。它怎么能够在伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河、阿姆河建造巨大的水闸，挖成新的海和可以通航的运河呢？苏联人民坚决反对战争，因为我们的社会整个活动是与和平分不开的。
    考涅楚克接着说：作为苏联最高苏维埃代表，我对参与苏联最高苏维埃于一九五一年三月十二日通过保卫和平法这件事很感到自豪。我衷心希望美国人民尽快制订这样的法律，我希望我这种好心的友好的愿望不被人看做干涉美国的内政（鼓掌）。
    考涅楚克说，苏联人民一向主张、而且将继续主张禁止原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器以及其他一切大规模杀人的武器；他们一向主张、而且将继续主张五大国逐步地同时把常规军备和武装部队裁减三分之一至一半，建立严格的国际管制，以监督上述禁令的执行，和裁减各种公开的和秘密的武器。
    考涅楚克说：我愿意向你们保证，对于任何和平倡议，不管它是哪里提出的，我们一定给予极大的注意和衷心的支持。考涅楚克特别说到和平公约问题。他说：全体苏联人民都在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。在这个大会上，我们必须设法使美国、英国、苏联、中国和法国五大国的政府知道在要求缔结和平公约的宣言上签名的六亿人的意愿以及我们大会的意愿。他说：我也同意在这里发过言的许多位代表的意见，认为我们必须进行坚决的斗争，使联合国成为真正的国际和平与合作的工具。
    考涅楚克说：我想谈谈不同的国度里的政治家们提出的两种计划。艾森豪威尔先生一九五二年九月四日在费城共和党集会上说：美国的创造力、想像力和生产计划已再度转向战争和战争前途，它的经济是战争经济，它的繁荣是战争的繁荣。
    我们看到这种前途对朝鲜人民有着怎样的意义。全世界人民决不会忘记备受蹂躏的英勇的朝鲜所遭受的说不尽的苦难。我们知道得很清楚，这种前途对全世界人民——包括美国人民在内——有着怎样的意义。
    但是也有另一种前途。这就是格·马·马林科夫——最卓越的苏联领袖之一——所提出而为苏联人民所衷心接受的一种前途。现在存在着保持和平的前途，各国人民之间和平的前途，这种前途要求遵照联合国所通过的决议禁止战争宣传，禁止原子武器和细菌武器，逐步裁减大国的武装部队，缔结大国和平公约，扩大国际贸易，恢复统一的国际市场，以及其他本着加强和平的精神的类似措施。采取这些措施就会加强和平，就会免除各国人民对于战争危险的恐惧，就会终止在扩张军备和准备毁灭性战争上面的空前的物资消耗，这样就有可能把这些物资转而用到人民福利上面。
    考涅楚克说，苏联主张采取这些措施，主张国际和平的前途。
    于是全体代表起立，向苏联代表鼓掌欢呼达几分钟之久。
    比利时代表卡文尼尔接着发言，他说的是国家独立问题。
    他说到舒曼计划和欧洲防御集团条约的法律方面。他指出：比利时签订这些违反比利时宪法的条约以后，就走上了出卖国家主权与独立的道路，比利时人民正在丧失着决定他们自己命运的权利。在签订了这些条约而使国家的经济转上战争的轨道以后，比利时的经济情况更加恶化了。
    卡文尼尔最后指出：联合国宪章和一些导向新的世界大战的外交条约是水火不相容的。他说：现在比利时应当起来反对那种违反它的传统、违反它所承担的国际义务和有失为一个文明国家的尊严的政策。
    大会接着宣读了伊朗著名宗教领袖卡沙尼的贺电。他在给大会的贺电中写道：全世界各国和平拥护者的人数日益增加。他指出：非正义的战争正在使朝鲜、越南和马来亚人民遭受痛苦。电文说：我希望这种流血行为不再继续下去。我决定要告诫青年们。我要求世界人民和平大会代表们采取坚决行动，保卫世界和平。
    挪威代表伏贝克牧师作了简短的发言。他说，挪威人民已愈来愈明白，挪威加入大西洋公约是错误的。现在主张保持中立的运动正在挪威展开，和平拥护者的人数日益增加，他们相信他们的斗争并不是徒劳无益的。最后他要求大会团结一切力量争取和平。
    接着发言的是伊朗代表团团长阿默德·沙里亚特·萨德，他特别说到民族独立问题。沙里亚特·萨德谈到两次世界大战给伊朗带来的严重后果。他说，第一次世界大战巩固了英帝国主义对我国的统治，第二次世界大战则带来了美帝国主义的统治；美帝国主义不但竭力攫夺伊朗全国财富，而且还竭力使伊朗在政治上和经济上沦于附属地位，以便利用它的资源和领土准备对它的邻国苏联发动第三次世界大战。
    沙里亚特·萨德还谈到为收回英帝国主义所攫夺的伊朗石油富源而进行的斗争，这个斗争和伊朗人民争取民族独立的总斗争是分不开的。伊朗人民知道，争取他们民族独立的斗争必须与争取停止目前战争的斗争同时进行。
    沙里亚特·萨德最后要求缔结五大国和平公约——这个公约将成为世界人民的真正宪章。伊朗代表团赞成这样的建议：大会通过致五大国政府呼吁书，要求它们满足各国人民的正当愿望，并保证全世界各国人民的安全和独立。
    晚间会议上最后发言的是以色列代表班托夫和厄瓜多尔代表恩里克·阿杜姆。
