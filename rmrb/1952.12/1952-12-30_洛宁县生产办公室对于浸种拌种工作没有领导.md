    To the Editor: The seed soaking and mixing work in our county this year during wheat planting was done very poorly. The main reason is that the County Production Office did not promptly lead in solving the problem of seed mixing agents. The pesticides (red and white arsenic, and Ceresan) allocated to our county by the Special Commissioner's Office should have been collected by the County Cooperative, but Director Li of the cooperative said that the drugs collected last year had not been fully loaned to the districts, and refused to collect them. Later, due to the needs of the farmers in various townships, the cooperative had no choice but to send someone to collect them, but by the time they were collected, the wheat planting season had passed. At the County People's Representative Conference and the County Labor Model Conference, everyone criticized the government for not providing agricultural drugs in a timely manner, saying that the government's loan of agricultural drugs was "providing an umbrella after the rain, just talk and no one cares." At this time, the cadres of various districts complained that the county cooperative did not supply agricultural drugs in a timely manner, and the county cooperative complained that the districts were storing agricultural drugs and not distributing them to the masses. Everyone blamed each other, and no one examined the problems in their work. We feel that the County Production Office did not seize the time to solve this problem, which caused great losses to production work. This should be reviewed. However, the relevant personnel of the County Cooperative and various districts should also conduct a review for being irresponsible in collecting and distributing agricultural drugs and shirking responsibility.

### 洛宁县生产办公室对于浸种拌种工作没有领导

    洛宁县生产办公室对于浸种拌种工作没有领导
    编辑同志：我县今年种麦时的浸种拌种工作做得很不好，主要原因是县生产办公室没有及时领导解决拌种药剂问题。今年专署分配给我县的农药（红、白砒和赛力散），本应该是县合作社去领的，但该社李主任说去年领的药交给各区还未全部贷完，拒绝去领。以后因各乡农民需要，该社不得已才派人去领，等领回来已过了种麦时间。县各界人民代表会和县劳动模范大会上，大家都批评政府贷农药不及时误了事，说政府贷农药是“雨后送伞，光说没人管”。这时各区干部都埋怨县合作社供给农药不及时，县合作社又埋怨各区存着农药不发给群众，大家互相埋怨，谁也不检查工作中的毛病。我们觉得县生产办公室对这问题没有抓紧时间解决，使生产工作受了很大损失，这是应该检讨的，但是县合作社和各区的有关人员对领发农药，不负责任，互相推诿，也应进行检讨。　河南省洛宁县通讯组
