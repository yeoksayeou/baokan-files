Title: Resolutely Uphold the Right to Unconditional Repatriation of Prisoners of War

    The U.S. side has been continuously killing our captured personnel. Taking just the past month as an example: On November 6th, 21 of our captured personnel were killed or wounded on Pi-do Island. On November 10th, the U.S. side announced that one prisoner of war had "hanged himself" (in September and October, the U.S. side had also announced that three prisoners of war had "hanged themselves" in this camp). On November 16th, one of our prisoners of war was killed on Koje Island. On the 25th, in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, another 32 of our captured personnel were killed or wounded, and on the 29th, another prisoner of war was wounded on the island. In November alone, and based only on the information disclosed by the U.S. side, 56 of our captured personnel were already abused and wounded. Since last December, more than 3,000 of our prisoners of war have been killed or wounded by the U.S. side, including the two massacres of December 22nd and 23rd of last year, in which the U.S. side killed or wounded 784 prisoners of war in Camp 62 on Koje Island by forcibly carrying out "screening", and on February 18th of this year, the "re-screening" killed or wounded 214 prisoners of war. Such blatant violations of international law and the brutal and cowardly act of large-scale killing of prisoners of war is unprecedented in world history, except for the Hitler bandits.
    The reason why the U.S. aggressors are carrying out such inhumane killings and persecutions of disarmed, unarmed captured personnel is because they are deliberately trying to forcibly detain our prisoners of war, and they are willing to resort to such brutal means to cancel the prisoners of war rights enjoyed by the Korean and Chinese captured personnel, which are protected by the 1949 Geneva Convention. Even the American newspapers and news agencies, and the "International Committee of the Red Cross," a tool of the United States, unanimously admit that the U.S. side is killing them because the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war opposed the U.S. side's use of spies from the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to forcibly "screen" them, forcing them to declare their refusal to return to their homeland to live a peaceful life, because they refused to tattoo marks of betraying their motherland on their arms and refused to put blood prints on the "voluntary repatriation" request forms, because they sang songs of their motherland and celebrated the liberation of their motherland, and because they wanted to hang the flag of their great motherland and tear up the despicable flags of the puppets... These facts fully prove that the U.S. lie that prisoners of war are unwilling to return to their country has already completely failed. The U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forcible repatriation" are completely conspiracies to undermine the armistice negotiations and obstruct the realization of peace. Using spies, bayonets, machine guns, gas bombs, and clubs to kill and persecute prisoners of war, to threaten and force prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation," this is the "humanitarian principle" in the mouths of the robbers! Seeing these bloody facts, anyone in the world with a little sense of justice cannot help but express indignation. As for us, the Chinese people, we will remember this blood debt, our children and grandchildren will never forget this hatred, and we are determined to oppose the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to detain prisoners of war to the end.
    This barbaric and tyrannical behavior of the United States is a blatant violation of the Geneva Convention. Even the British press cannot defend this evil act of the U.S. government, and Mrs. Roosevelt, a member of the U.S. delegation to previous UN General Assembly meetings, had to frankly and publicly say that the United States cannot too thoroughly abide by various international conventions. This is nothing new. Anyone with a little political experience knows that all robbers must first tear up international conventions when they want to launch a bloody war of aggression. Hitler's Germany and Japan were like this. Now, the United States has repeatedly trampled on the international conventions it once solemnly signed! World peace is under serious threat. At this time, to defend peace, we must resolutely safeguard the dignity of international conventions. Any indulgence or appeasement of robbers who tear up international conventions will inevitably cause the flames of war to burn bigger and bigger, until they are out of control. We must remember the painful lessons of Germany and Japan before the Second World War. Therefore, we firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on November 28th, support Vishinsky's speech on the Korean issue at the UN General Assembly on November 10th, resolutely oppose the conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the armistice negotiations under the name of "non-forcible repatriation," and cannot agree to any practice of sacrificing the Geneva Convention to condone aggressive robbers. We must not give up the right to unconditional repatriation of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, which they defend with their blood under the enemy's bayonets and machine guns. We believe that the fact that the UN General Assembly actually rejected the Soviet proposal and adopted the Indian proposal, which appeared as a disguised U.S. proposal, under the violent pressure of the U.S. side is a shameful act of the United Nations.
    We, the Chinese people, are very familiar with the ancestral instruction passed down by our ancestors to "appease evil," and we will never fantasize about succumbing to the forces of violence to seek a temporary peace. We protest against the U.S. aggressors' cowardly and shameful cruel act of killing prisoners of war, and we are determined to fight for a reasonable peaceful solution to the Korean issue and for the defense of world peace and justice! We believe that our just cause will surely win, and the U.S. murderers' mad destruction of peace and humanitarianism will be completely defeated.

### 坚决维护无条件遣返战俘的权利

    坚决维护无条件遣返战俘的权利
    美方一直在继续不断地残杀我方被俘人员。仅拿最近一个月来说，就有：十一月六日，在蜂岩岛上打死打伤我被俘人员二十一名。十一月十日，据美方宣布：一名战俘“上吊自杀”（在九、十月间，美方也曾先后宣布在这俘虏营中有三名战俘“上吊自杀”）。十一月十六日，在巨济岛杀害我方战俘一人。二十五日，在巨济岛战俘营又打死打伤我方被俘人员三十二名，二十九日，在该岛又一名战俘被打伤。仅仅在十一月份内，而且仅仅是根据美方透露出来的消息，就已虐杀和打伤我方被俘人员五十六名。从去年十二月到现在被美方打死打伤的我方战俘，已经有三千余人之多，其中包括去年十二月二十二、二十三日美方在巨济岛战俘营六十二号营场因武力强迫“甄别”而打死打伤战俘七百八十四名，和今年二月十八日“重新甄别”打死打伤二百十四名战俘的两次大屠杀案。这样公然破坏国际公法、大规模屠杀战俘的凶残卑怯的行为，除了希特勒匪徒外，在世界历史上是没有先例的。
    美国侵略者所以对已解除了武装的、赤手空拳的被俘人员进行这样惨无人道的屠杀与迫害，是因为它要蓄意强迫扣留我方战俘，不惜采取此种残暴手段来取消朝中被俘人员所应享受的为一九四九年日内瓦公约所维护的战俘权利。就连美国的报纸和通讯社、美国的御用工具“红十字国际委员会”也一致承认，美方是由于朝中被俘人员反对美方利用李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务们去强迫“甄别”，强迫他们声明拒绝回到祖国的土地上来过和平的生活，由于他们拒绝在手臂上刺上背叛祖国的标记和拒绝在“自愿遣返”的请求书上盖血印，由于他们歌唱祖国的歌曲和庆祝祖国的解放，由于他们要悬挂伟大祖国的国旗而撕毁傀儡的可耻的旗帜……，因而屠杀他们的。这些事实，充分证明美方所谓战俘不愿回到祖国来的谎话早已全部破产了，美方所谓“自愿遣返”、“不强迫遣返”完全是破坏停战谈判、阻挠和平实现的阴谋。用特务、用刺刀、用机关枪、用瓦斯弹、用棍棒来屠杀、迫害战俘，来威胁、强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”，这就是强盗们口中的“人道原则”！看到这些血淋淋的事实，全世界任何稍有正义感的人是不能够不表示愤慨的。至于我们中国人民，我们将记住这种血海深仇，我们的子子孙孙将永远也不会忘记这种仇恨，我们决心反对美国侵略者扣留战俘的阴谋到底。
    美国这一野蛮、横暴的行为是明目张胆地违反了日内瓦公约的。即使英国报界也不能为美国政府这种恶行辩解，而参加历届联合国大会会议的美国代表团团员罗斯福夫人也只好坦率地公开说：美国不能过于彻底地遵守各种国际公约。这已经不是什么新鲜的事情了，稍有政治经验的人都会知道：一切强盗们要发动血腥的侵略战争的时候，都必然要首先撕毁国际公约，希特勒德国和日本都是这样。现在，美国已经一再地践踏它曾经庄严签字的国际公约了！世界的和平已受到严重的威胁。在这个时候，要保卫和平，就必须坚决维护国际公约的尊严。任何对撕毁国际公约的强盗们的纵容或姑息，都必然会使战火越烧越大，终至不可收拾。第二次世界大战前对德国和日本的惨痛教训，我们必须好好记取。因此，我们坚决拥护周外长十一月二十八日的声明，拥护维辛斯基十一月十日在联合国大会提出的关于朝鲜问题的演说，坚决反对在“不强迫遣返”的名称下实现强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战谈判的阴谋，对任何牺牲日内瓦公约来纵容侵略强盗的做法都决不能同意，我们决不能放弃朝、中被俘人员在敌人的刺刀和机关枪下面以鲜血来保卫的无条件遣返的权利。我们认为这次联合国大会居然在美方的狂暴压力下否决了苏联提案而通过了作为改头换面的美国提案出现的印度提案，是联合国的可耻行为。
    我们中国人民很熟悉我们祖先流传下来的“姑息养奸”的遗训，我们决不幻想屈服于强暴的势力下来求得苟安的和平，我们抗议美国侵略者卑怯可耻的屠杀战俘的残忍行为，我们坚决为争取合理地和平解决朝鲜问题，为保卫世界的和平和正义而奋斗！我们相信，我们的正义事业必定胜利，美国杀人犯对和平和人道主义的疯狂破坏必将完全失败。
