     Introducing a Green Manure Plant - Amorpha fruticosa
     Agricultural Production Department, Ministry of Agriculture

    Amorpha fruticosa (also known as Cotton Amorpha, or Weasel Bush) is a perennial leguminous shrub with leaves that closely resemble those of the locust tree. In summer, it blooms with clusters of small purple butterfly-shaped flowers at the tips, and in autumn, it produces fragrant, brown pods. Amorpha fruticosa has a long history of cultivation in China, distributed in Northeast China, North China, and Shandong, mostly used as the lower layer of windbreak and sandbreak forest belts. Another important agricultural use is as green manure.

    According to the analysis of the North China Agricultural Science Institute, the green branches and leaves of Amorpha fruticosa contain 1.32% nitrogen, 0.30% phosphoric acid, and 0.79% potassium oxide. It is estimated that every 600 jin of green branches and leaves is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of about 100 jin of bean cake. Amorpha fruticosa grows very quickly. Seedlings cultivated in the spring of the same year can yield about 1,000 jin of green branches and leaves per mu in the autumn; the second year can yield 2,000 to 3,000 jin. "Stumps" that are three years or older can produce 5,000 to 6,000 jin of branches per mu each year. In this way, the income per mu of Amorpha fruticosa is equal to the value of eight to nine hundred jin of bean cake.

    According to the field trials conducted by the Junliangcheng Experimental Farm of the Bohai Reclamation Bureau from 1949 to 1951, using Amorpha fruticosa as green manure can increase rice production by about 20 jin per 100 jin of green branches and leaves. The results of a large-scale field comparison test in Junliangcheng in 1949 showed that a field using 200 jin of bean cake and 20 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu produced 888 jin of rice; a field using 1,200 jin of Amorpha fruticosa and 20 jin of ammonium sulfate produced 884 jin of rice. This experimental result also confirms that six jin of Amorpha fruticosa can抵一斤豆饼。

    Amorpha fruticosa is resistant to salinity and drought. According to the experiment of Junliangcheng Experimental Farm of Bohai Reclamation Bureau, its seedlings still grow normally in the case of 0.39% salt content in the soil. There are many saline-alkali wastelands in coastal and inland areas of our country that have not been utilized; even those that have been utilized have low yields due to the lack of organic matter and the harm of salinity. If Amorpha fruticosa can be planted in large quantities, the soil in these areas can be gradually improved and turned into fertile farmland. In the vast plains, Amorpha fruticosa can be planted everywhere on field edges, roadsides, canal sides, and rural open spaces. Planting Amorpha fruticosa is very easy. Except for the initial stage of seedling cultivation when irrigation is needed in dry weather, no pruning or irrigation is required afterwards, and the new branches grow more vigorously as they are cut.

    The planting method of Amorpha fruticosa is also very easy. On the edges of fields, ditches, canal banks, roadsides, and areas with lighter salinity, direct seeding can be used. Dig a hole about one foot wide and five inches deep every two feet or so, put in a few seeds, cover with one inch of soil, and cover the soil with weeds to retain moisture and prevent the soil from drying out. If the soil is dry, water can be applied before sowing. Cuttings can be planted during the rainy season in June and July or after leaf fall in late autumn. If large-scale planting is planned, seedlings can be cultivated first, and then transplanted.

    "Stumps" of Amorpha fruticosa that are more than two years old can be harvested two to three times a year. When harvesting twice, once at the end of May and once at the end of September. When harvesting three times, the first time is at the end of May, the second time is at the end of July, and the third time is at the beginning of October. The harvest time can be advanced or postponed in various places according to the local climate.

    The method of using Amorpha fruticosa as green manure is also very simple. After cutting the green branches and leaves, chop them into one or two-inch lengths with a chaff cutter, and they can be used for composting. The method of making compost is: first lay a layer of broken soil on the ground, add a layer of chopped Amorpha fruticosa, pour some thin human manure or add some livestock manure, and pour in an appropriate amount of water. Pile up layer by layer in this way, up to four or five feet high. Finally, apply a layer of one-inch thick mud. It can be completely decomposed in one month in summer and in two or three months in winter. In areas with the habit of composting, Amorpha fruticosa can also be directly put into the manure pit to decompose. Compost made from Amorpha fruticosa is best used as base fertilizer, and the application method is the same as that of general farmyard manure and compost. In rice areas, the chopped green branches and leaves of Amorpha fruticosa can be directly scattered into the fields as green manure before cultivating the land.

    Through scientific analysis, farm experiments, and practical application by labor models, it has been proven that Amorpha fruticosa is a good green manure plant and is worthy of widespread promotion. The Ministry of Agriculture has purchased a large batch of Amorpha fruticosa seeds in the Northeast and plans to promote it in the entire North China region and Shandong, Henan, and other places next year.

     介绍一种绿肥植物——紫穗槐
     中央农业部农业生产司
    紫穗槐（又名绵槐、鼬萩）是一种多年生的豆科灌木，叶子长得很像洋槐，夏季在尖端开一簇紫色蝶形小花，秋季结成褐色带香味的小荚。紫穗槐在我国栽培的历史已经很久，分布在东北、华北和山东一带，大半用作防风林网和防沙林网的低层林带。它在农业上的另一个重要用途是作绿肥。
    据华北农业科学研究所分析，紫穗槐的青枝叶含氮百分之一·三二，磷酸○·三○，氧化钾○·七九。计算起来，每六百斤青枝叶约相当于一百斤豆饼的肥效。紫穗槐生长得很快，当年春季育的苗，到秋季每亩就可以收割约一千斤青枝叶；第二年能收割二三千斤。三年以上的“墩子”，每年每亩能生长出五六千斤枝条。这样，每亩紫穗槐的收益就等于八九百斤豆饼的价值。
    据渤海区农垦管理局军粮城试验场一九四九年到一九五一年的田间试验，用紫穗槐作绿肥，每百斤青枝叶可增产稻谷约二十斤。一九四九年军粮城大田对比试验结果，每亩用豆饼二百斤、硫酸铵二十斤的田，产稻谷八百八十八斤；用紫穗槐一千二百斤，硫酸铵二十斤的田，产稻谷八百八十四斤。这个试验结果也证实了，六斤紫穗槐可以抵一斤豆饼。
    紫穗槐具有耐盐碱性和耐旱性。据渤海区农垦管理局军粮城试验场的试验，在土地含盐百分之○·三九的情况下，它的苗木生长得仍很正常。我国沿海及内地有许多盐碱荒地未被利用；就是已经利用的，因缺乏有机质，和盐碱为害，产量也很低微。如能大量种植紫穗槐，这些地的土壤就可以逐渐改良，变成肥沃的耕地。在广大平原地区，地头、道旁、渠边、农村隙地，到处都可以种植紫穗槐。紫穗槐种起来很省事，除在育苗初期旱时需要灌水外，以后不需要整枝，也不需要灌溉，而且新枝条越割发得越旺。
    紫穗槐的种植方法也很容易。在地头、沟边、渠岸、道路两旁，以及盐碱较轻地区，可用直接播种法种植，每隔二尺左右的距离，掘一直径约一尺宽五寸深的穴，放进几粒种籽，盖上一寸厚的土，土上盖上杂草，保持水分，不使土壤干燥。如土壤干旱，在播种之前，可先灌水。在六七月的雨季或深秋落叶后，可插条栽植。如果准备大面积种植，也可以先行育苗，然后移栽。
    二年以上的紫穗槐“墩子”，每年可以收割两次到三次。割两次时，一次在五月底，一次在九月底。割三次时，第一次在五月底，第二次在七月底，第三次在十月初。收割时间，各地可根据当地气候提前或推后。
    用紫穗槐压绿肥的方法也很简单。把青枝叶割下后，用铡刀切成一二寸长，就可以做堆肥。做堆肥的方法是：先在地上铺一层碎土，加上一层切碎的紫穗槐，浇些稀薄的人粪尿，或加些牲畜的粪便，浇上适量的水分。照这个方法层层向上堆，可堆到四五尺高。最后，涂上一层一寸厚的烂泥。夏季一个月就可以完全腐熟，冬季两三个月可以腐熟。在有沤肥习惯的地区，也可以把紫穗槐直接放在粪坑里沤熟。紫穗槐做的堆肥最好用作基肥，施用方法和一般厩肥、堆肥相同。在水稻地区，可把切碎的紫穗槐青枝叶，在耕地以前直接撒到地里作绿肥。
    经过科学分析、农场试验和劳动模范的实地应用，都证明紫穗槐是一种良好的绿肥植物，值得广泛提倡。中央农业部已在东北购得大批紫穗槐种籽，计划明年先在华北全区及山东、河南等地推广。
