Editor's Note: The "Branch Life" bi-monthly, edited by the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Branch Life Society, has now been publicly published for thirty-four issues. What is published here is the editorial experience of the "Branch Life" in the past year, covering the first twenty-nine issues. Based on these experiences, the journal has continued to improve since the thirtieth issue. The past editorial experience of the journal is of reference value to our Party's newspaper and magazine workers.

Since its public distribution in July of last year, the Tianjin "Branch Life" has published a total of twenty-nine issues, with the number of copies per issue increasing from 20,000 to 148,000. Over the past year, "Branch Life" has basically implemented the policy of conducting Party education and class education publicly among the working masses, as instructed by the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee. Thanks to the correct policy of the Municipal Party Committee, the specific leadership of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, and the help of the broad masses of Party members and workers, its influence has been expanded among Party members and the broad masses of workers, and it has played a good role in publicizing the Communist Party and conducting class education. We often receive letters from readers saying, "After reading 'Branch Life,' my understanding of the Party is clearer." "After reading 'Branch Life,' I have a clearer understanding of the working class and the bourgeoisie." Many workers have suggested: "Study 'Branch Life' and strive to join the Party!" More than 300 of the 600 workers at the Renli Woolen Mill have subscribed to "Branch Life," and a single factory, the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, distributes more than 1,000 copies of "Branch Life." The facts show that "Branch Life" has become one of the important political reading materials inside and outside the Party.

Over the past year or so, in the editorial work of "Branch Life," we have explored and taken many detours. Some problems have been solved, and some achievements have been made. This includes experience and also contains lessons.

I. The Issue of Connecting with Reality: "Branch Life" is a publication for ideological education of worker Party members and the masses. Therefore, it must be targeted at the ideological problems of the working masses in production and study to achieve the purpose of raising class consciousness and promoting production. This is the key to determining the ideological nature and guiding nature of the publication. In solving this problem, a series of issues were encountered. (1) The first is the issue of target audience. Only by making the target audience singular and determining who the publication is for, can a clear editorial policy be formulated. Initially, the target audience of "Branch Life" was not clear enough. It wanted to take into account the different requirements of Party members in different branches of factories, government offices, and schools. As a result, cadres felt it was "meaningless," Party members in schools felt it was "not very relevant," and Party members among workers felt it was "too deep and difficult to understand." This formed a phenomenon of "attending to one thing and losing sight of another." Later, we convened district committee and Party committee secretaries to report on the situation of studying "Branch Life" in the branches. On the other hand, with the development of branch education work, we conducted a survey of twenty-seven typical Party members and found that most Party members were new Party members with low cultural levels who did not know "how to be a Party member? How to do work?" Therefore, it was decided to revise the publication, clearly stipulating that "Branch Life" would target Party branch committee members, general Party members, and workers in factories and streets, and increase content such as basic Party knowledge, branch business knowledge, and current affairs policies, striving for simple and accessible language. Worker Party members said: "This is really for us." "Branch Life" was not even distributed before people went to the district committee to urge for it. (2) After the target audience was determined, the next step was to solve the problem of how to serve them. Since the target audience of "Branch Life" is Party members and workers in factories, it must be combined with the central movements in factories in various periods and the education plans for Party members and workers to solve the problems existing in their work, study, and thinking. Experience has proved that the more it is combined with the work and study of Party members and workers, the richer the content and the more welcome it is; conversely, if it is divorced from their work and ideological reality, it will not be welcomed. From the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement, the Patriotic Production Emulation Movement, the Donation of Aircraft and Artillery Movement, the Party Consolidation Work, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements in the winter of 1950, to the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement after July of this year, as well as the education on the eight criteria for Party members, the education on Communism and the Communist Party, class education since the beginning of 1951, and the recent education on the eight criteria for Party members for activists, "Branch Life" has roughly combined these central movements in factories and branch education, worker education plans in the above periods to conduct a series of Party building education and worker political education. At the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in December of the year before last, patriotic and internationalist education was conducted through "Branch Life." After studying "Branch Life," some Party members distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, strengthened their revolutionary will, criticized their own erroneous thoughts, proposed learning from Liu Hulan, and actively applied for military cadre schools. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, "Branch Life" focused on conducting class education for worker Party members and the working masses to draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie. In the early and mid-stages of the movement, "Branch Life" criticized the erroneous ideas that "capitalists support workers," "capitalists make money because they have good lives," "capitalists make money because they are capable," and "it is more free to go home and farm a few acres than to be a worker." The essence of the bourgeoisie was discussed in the "Party Lesson" column, various misconceptions were criticized in the "Q&A" column, the history of capitalists' fortunes was depicted in comic strips, and Party members' own reviews of the influence of bourgeois ideology were published in the "Criticism and Self-Criticism" column. This enabled Party members and the working masses to recognize the reactionary side of the bourgeoisie and the great future of the working class, dispel ideological concerns, and actively participate in the struggle to expose illegal capitalists and corrupt elements. In the later stages of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the "leftist" ideological sentiments were also centrally criticized in several issues of "Branch Life," and education was conducted on the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie and the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit. In this way, whenever a central task arrived, "Branch Life" became a powerful assistant to the work of Party branches in factories and mines. (3) In connecting with reality, it is not enough to simply cooperate with whatever work is being done. It is also necessary to further grasp the fundamental ideological problems in a certain period and solve them in a concentrated and planned manner. In the past, we were not clear enough about this point. Therefore, we often passively followed behind the central work, and the solution of ideological problems was scattered and not powerful enough. This also affected the guiding nature and planning of the entire publication. For example, in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, "Branch Life" was busy catching up with a series of specific tasks in the competition, such as setting plans, finding tricks, summarizing tricks, and establishing systems. However, the fundamental ideological problem to be solved in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement – the conservative and complacent ideology (this ideology runs through the above-mentioned specific tasks) – was not criticized in a timely, concentrated, and systematic manner. This is also a manifestation of the lack of ideological and combat effectiveness of "Branch Life."

II. The Issue of Popularization: "Branch Life" targets Party members and the working masses in factories. They generally have low cultural levels, with most having the cultural level of the third or fourth grade of elementary school. Therefore, "Branch Life" must adopt a policy of popularization in content. We also went through some processes on the issue of popularization. (1) First of all, the policy of popularization encountered a lot of ideological resistance. The main one was the belief that: "Party publications are different from general mass publications, and popularization will affect the seriousness of Party publications." However, the facts after the revision proved that: "After 'Branch Life' became popularized, Party members and the working masses could better accept the serious ideological principles of Party publications through the in-depth and easy-to-understand content they liked." They all said: "'Branch Life' is really helpful to us!" (2) After the policy of popularization was determined, what specific forms were used to achieve popularization? In the initial stage, in addition to striving for simple language and short articles, we also paid attention to three points: visualization, storytelling, and artisticization. We adopted forms such as illustrations, short stories, clapper talk, and rhyming dialogues. These were all well-received by the masses. The martyr biographies and revolutionary leader stories in "Branch Life" were among the most popular articles among the masses. After reading stories about revolutionary leaders such as Chairman Mao and Lenin and the heroic deeds of Liu Hulan, Fang Zhimin, Liu Zhidan, and others, they generally reflected: they were very moved. (3) However, simply adopting these forms did not solve all the problems of popularization. According to our investigation, the most popular articles in "Branch Life" at that time were the martyr biographies, leader stories, and red lists that praised the deeds of model Party members, while fewer people read the "Short Commentaries," "Party Lessons," and "Policy Speeches" that directly conducted basic Party knowledge education, policy education, and current affairs education. How can theoretical and policy-related things be made easy for workers to accept? After a period of exploration, we found that supplementing with two forms, Q&A and quizzes, was more effective. The advantage of Q&A is that the questions and answers are sharp and clear, making it easy to grasp the core. The quiz combines the thinking of the masses and uses simple and easy-to-answer forms (fill-in-the-blanks, true or false, multiple choice, etc.) to create quiz questions. Both forms are of great benefit in enlightening and urging the masses to study and review and consolidate their learning gains. The "Learning Q&A" and "Policy Q&A" of "Branch Life" were often broadcast in factories, and the quiz could receive up to 4,000 answers per issue. When we investigated among the masses again at this time, we found that columns such as "Q&A," "Quizzes," and "Party Lessons" had become the most popular content among the masses in "Branch Life." However, "Branch Life" still has several shortcomings in its popularization work: one is that in order to popularize, there have been errors in meaning due to words, such as explaining the united front as making friends, etc.; the other is that it is not diverse enough, and some forms liked by the masses, such as discussion meetings and clubs, have not been well adopted; at the same time, when explaining some theoretical and policy-related issues, whether in "Short Speeches," "Party Lessons," or "Q&A," there is still relatively more conceptual indoctrination, and not enough use of living people and living things to illustrate living principles. According to our survey of 298 readers, only 57% liked to read "Short Speeches."

III. The Issue of Mass Work in Editorial Work: "Branch Life" has about 300 correspondents. Most of the letters from readers requesting answers to specific questions about learning, joining the Party, and resuming work were answered. For example, Liu Pengli, a worker at the Tongxin Textile and Dyeing Factory, wrote to say that the factory regulations set by the capitalist were unreasonable. After we forwarded the letter to the Labor Bureau, it was resolved, and the unreasonable factory regulations were revised. The "Quizzes" sometimes received more than 7,000 copies a month, coming from all over the country, as far away as Dihua, Hainan Island, and Inner Mongolia. Many readers attached letters to the quizzes, requesting answers to questions and at the same time making suggestions for "Branch Life." This is of great help in strengthening the ideological and mass nature of "Branch Life." However, because our understanding of relying on the masses to run the publication well is not enough, and also because of the lack of cadre strength, the processing of manuscripts from correspondents and letters from readers is not timely enough, and there are sometimes serious backlogs (the most serious backlog is more than half a year). Thousands of quizzes per month have not been well processed. Only the better ones are selected and given prizes, and activists are not discovered through the quizzes to consolidate contact with them. This prevents "Branch Life" from fully understanding the problems and situations among the masses from the bottom up, analyzing and improving them, and educating the masses, which directly affects the ideological and mass nature of the publication.

IV. The Issue of Combining with Party Committees at All Levels and Relevant Leading Organs: To run Party publications well, in addition to doing mass work and understanding the problems among the masses from the bottom up, it is necessary to combine with relevant leading organs, especially Party committees at all levels, to obtain help and support; to understand the intentions of the leadership, work plans, and problems in the work from the top down, and based on these, to conduct education in combination with the problems among the masses. Therefore, combining with Party committees at all levels and relevant leading organs is a decisive condition for determining the ideological and guiding nature of "Branch Life," which is a concrete manifestation of implementing the principle of running publications by the whole Party. "Branch Life" was originally a publication directly run by the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee from its inception. However, initially, the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department was responsible for the editorial work, so the content of the publication focused on guiding the work of the branches. Later, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department was responsible for the editorial work, so it could be closely combined with branch education and worker education. In addition, "Branch Life" also needs to obtain the help and support of the Party committees of various factories and mines, district committees, and trade unions. "Branch Life" established part-time correspondent secretaries in various Party committees and district committees to lead the correspondence work of their units and report the situation to "Branch Life." Responsible comrades from relevant leading organs (Municipal Party Committee Organization Department, Trade Union Cultural and Education Department, Municipal Party Committee Party School) were invited to form the editorial board. "Branch Life" often took the initiative to find out about the situation from the trade union and the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department and invited them to write manuscripts, so that "Branch Life" was constantly improving in combining with the central work. However, because our understanding of the principle of running publications by the whole Party is insufficient, we have not well led the correspondence work, nor have we well played the role of the editorial board. Therefore, not having well obtained the guidance and strong assistance of Party committees at all levels and relevant leading organs is also one of the important reasons affecting the weak ideological nature of "Branch Life."

Based on the above situation, "Branch Life" should make the following improvements in the future:

I. Strengthen Ideological Nature: In terms of editorial policy and editorial thinking, it should be clearly understood what the ideological problems of a fundamental nature are that need to be solved in a concentrated manner in a certain period and a movement. Based on this, an editorial plan for a certain period should be formulated to solve these ideological problems in a planned and step-by-step manner. Major ideological problems can be organized for discussion. At the same time, it is planned to strengthen the guidance of branch work. The "Branch Work Speech" column should change from generally explaining the tasks of branch work to explaining how the branch can complete the tasks in combination with various central tasks. As long as "Branch Life" truly solves one or two relatively important ideological problems in a certain period, the ideological and combat effectiveness can be greatly improved.

II. Further Popularize: Further implement the principle of popularization "from near to far, from concrete to abstract," reduce and even overcome the phenomenon of conceptual indoctrination, and pay attention to using living people and living things to illustrate principles in the "Party Lesson" and "Q&A" columns. Pay attention to improving popularization and avoid errors in meaning and vulgarization. In order to further realize the diversification of content and form, gradually increase and restore the "Discussion Meeting" (organize readers to discuss more important ideological problems) and the back cover picture (publish photos of Party members' work, study, and life, etc.). At the same time, in coordination with the study of the rapid literacy method, increase the texts on Communism and the Communist Party, compile one or two hundred words per issue, with phonetic symbols attached to facilitate reading.

III. Strengthen Mass Work: Clearly recognize the fundamental mass line of relying on the masses to run Party publications well, and gradually unite and cultivate more correspondents and activists around "Branch Life" to report the situation and write manuscripts for "Branch Life." We plan to do the following two main tasks well: (1) In the next month, through clearing up the backlog of manuscripts and establishing correspondent secretaries in the Party committees of various state-owned enterprises, resume the communication work such as the monthly meeting of correspondent secretaries; (2) Properly handle the letters from readers, ensure that all general letters are answered, and contact a group of activists among them.

Other things such as further implementing the principle of running publications by the whole Party and strengthening the distribution work are all items we should strive for.

    一年多来“支部生活”的编辑工作
    天津“支部生活”社
    编者按：中共天津市委支部生活社编辑的“支部生活”半月刊，现在已经公开出版了三十四期。这里发表的是“支部生活”过去一年多出版的二十九期的编辑工作经验。根据这些经验，该刊从三十期以后已继续有了改进。该刊过去的编辑经验对于我们党的报刊工作者是有参考价值的。
    天津“支部生活”自去年七月公开发行以来，共出二十九期，每期发行份数由二万份增至十四万八千份。一年多来，“支部生活”基本上执行了中共天津市委所指示的在工人群众中公开进行党的教育和阶级教育的方针。由于市委的方针正确，和市委宣传部的具体领导，广大党员、工人群众的帮助，因而在党员和广大工人群众中扩大了它的影响，在宣传共产党和进行阶级教育方面起了良好的作用。我们经常收到读者来信表示说：“看了‘支部生活’，对党认识更清楚了。”“看了‘支部生活’，更认清工人阶级和资产阶级了。”有不少工人群众提出：“学习‘支部生活’，争取入党！”仁立毛呢厂六百工人中有三百多人订了“支部生活”，国营天津第二棉纺织厂一个厂销行“支部生活”一千份以上。事实说明，
    “支部生活”已成为党内外重要的政治读物之一。
    一年多来，在“支部生活”编辑工作中，我们曾摸索地走了不少弯路，有些问题得到了解决，也取得一些成绩，这里面有经验，也包含了教训。
    一、联系实际的问题：“支部生活”是对工人党员和群众进行思想教育的刊物，因此，必须针对工人群众在生产、学习中的思想问题进行教育，以达到提高阶级觉悟，推进生产的目的。这是决定刊物思想性、指导性的关键。在解决这一问题中，曾遇到一系列的问题。（1）首先是对象问题。只有使对象单一化，确定刊物办给谁看，然后才能规定明确的编辑方针。“支部生活”最初对象不够明确，要兼顾工厂、机关、学校不同支部党员的不同要求，结果干部看了觉得“没意思”，学生中党员看了认为“关系不大”，工人中党员看了认为“太深，不懂。”形成“顾此失彼”的现象。以后我们召集区委、党委干事汇报，了解了支部中学习“支部生活”的情况；另一方面随着支部教育工作的开展，我们作了二十七个典型党员的调查，发现一般党员皆为新党员，文化水平低，不知道“怎样当党员？怎样作工作？”于是决定改刊，明确规定“支部生活”以工厂、街道党支部委员、一般党员以及工人群众为对象，增加党的基本知识、支部业务知识、时事政策等内容，文字力求浅近。工人党员们说：“这下真是办给咱们看的了。”“支部生活”还没发下，就到区委去催要。（2）对象确定后，进一步解决的就是怎样为他们服务的问题。“支部生活”对象既是工厂中党员和工人群众，所以必须结合工厂中各个时期的中心运动及党员、工人教育计划，给他们解决工作、学习、思想中存在的问题。经验证明：越是和党员及工人的工作、学习相结合，内容也就越丰富，越能受到欢迎；相反，要是脱离他们的工作、思想实际，就不受欢迎。自一九五○年冬的抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动、爱国生产竞赛运动、捐献飞机大炮运动、整党工作、“三反”“五反”运动，至今年七月以后的增产节约运动以及自一九五一年初的党员标准八项条件的教育、共产主义与共产党的教育、阶级教育、到最近对积极分子进行党员标准八项条件的教育，“支部生活”大体上结合了以上各个时期工厂中的这些中心运动和支部教育、工人教育计划，进行了一系列的建党教育与工人政治教育。前年十二月抗美援朝运动开始时，通过“支部生活”进行了爱国主义和国际主义教育，有些党员学习了“支部生活”后，分清了敌我，坚定了革命意志，批判了自己的错误思想，提出向刘胡兰学习，踊跃地投考了军事干部学校。“三反”“五反”运动中“支部生活”集中地对工人党员与工人群众进行了划清工人阶级与资产阶级界限的阶级教育；在运动初期和中期，“支部生活”批判了那些认为“资本家养活工人”、
    “资本家赚钱是因为命好”、“资本家赚钱是本事大”以及“回家种几亩地比当工人自由”等错误思想；在“党课”栏中讲资产阶级本质，在“问答”栏中批判各种错误认识，在连环画中画资本家发家史，在“批评与自我批评”栏中登载党员自己对资产阶级思想影响的检讨。使党员和工人群众认清了资产阶级反动的一面和工人阶级伟大前途，解除了思想上的顾虑，积极参加了检举不法资本家和贪污分子的斗争。在“三反”“五反”后期又在数期“支部生活”中集中地批判了“左”的思想情绪，进行了关于资产阶级两面性、劳资两利政策的教育。这样，每次中心工作来到时，“支部生活”就成了工矿支部工作的有力助手。（3）在联系实际中，仅仅有什么工作就配合什么工作是不够的，还必须进一步抓住一定时期中的根本思想问题，集中地有计划地加以解决，过去我们对这一点是不够明确的，因而很多时候是被动地跟在中心工作后面赶，对思想问题的解决是零散而不够有力的，这样也就影响了整个刊物的指导性和计划性。如在增产节约运动中，“支部生活”忙于赶上竞赛中的订计划、找窍门、总结窍门、建立制度等一系列具体工作，对增产节约运动中所要解决的根本思想问题之一
    ——保守自满思想（这一思想贯穿于以上各项具体工作中）却没有及时地、集中地、有系统地加以批判。这也是“支部生活”思想性、战斗性不高的表现。
    二、通俗化问题：“支部生活”是以工厂中党员及工人群众为对象的。他们一般文化很低，以初小三、四年级文化水平者居多，所以“支部生活”在内容上必须采取通俗化的方针。在通俗化问题上我们也是经过一些过程的。（1）首先通俗化方针曾遇到很多思想抵抗。主要的是认为：“党刊与一般群众刊物不同，通俗化会影响党刊严肃性。”然而改刊后的事实证明了：“支部生活”通俗化以后，党员和工人群众更能通过他们所喜爱的深入浅出的内容来接受党刊的严肃的思想原则，都说：“‘支部生活’对咱们帮助真大！”（2）通俗化的方针确定后，通过什么具体形式来实现通俗化呢？最初一个阶段，我们除了力求文字浅近、文章短小外，还注意了形象化、故事化、文艺化三点，采用了插图、小故事、快板、数来宝等形式。这些都是群众喜闻乐见的。“支部生活”上的烈士传和革命领袖故事是群众最喜爱文章之一，他们看了关于毛主席、列宁等革命领袖的故事和刘胡兰、方志敏、刘志丹等人的英雄事迹后，普遍反映：很受感动。（3）但是仅仅采用这几种形式，并没有解决通俗化的全部问题，根据我们的调查，当时“支部生活”上最受欢迎的是烈士传、领袖故事、红榜等表扬党员模范事迹的文章，而直接进行党的基本知识教育、政策教育、时事教育的“小言论”、“党课”、“政策讲话”等栏看的人就要少些。理论性、政策性的东西怎样才能使工人们容易接受呢？经过一段摸索后，我们发现了辅以问答和小测验两种形式收效是比较大的。问答的长处是：问题提出和回答都尖锐、明确，容易抓住中心。小测验是结合群众的思想，用简单易答的形式（填空、是非、选择等）出测验题。两种形式在启发、督促群众学习和复习巩固学习收获上都有很大好处。“支部生活”的“学习问答”和“政策问答”经常在工厂中被广播，小测验每期最多能收到四千多份答案。这时我们再在群众中调查时，发现“问答”、“小测验”、“党课”等栏已成为“支部生活”上最受群众喜爱的内容了。但是，“支部生活”在通俗化工作中仍有几种缺点：一是为了通俗化发生了因词害意的错误现象，例如把统一战线解释为交朋友等；一是还不够多样化，有一些群众所喜好的形式：如讨论会、俱乐部等，尚未很好地采用；同时在解释一些带理论性、政策性问题时，无论在“小讲话”、“党课”还是“问答”中，概念式地灌输还比较多，用活人活事说明活道理作得不够。根据我们在二百九十八个读者中调查，爱看“小讲话”者只占百分之五十七。
    三、编辑工作中的群众工作问题：“支部生活”约有三百名左右通讯员，对于读者要求解答有关学习、入党与复工等具体问题的来信，绝大部分都作了回答。如同新织染厂工人刘鹏礼曾来信提出该厂资本家所订厂规不合理，我们把信转给劳动局以后，得到解决，不合理的厂规作了修改。“小测验”最多时一月来到七千余份，来自全国各地，有远自迪化、海南岛、内蒙古来的；很多读者在小测验中附上来信，要求解答问题，同时提出对“支部生活”的意见。这对加强“支部生活”思想性、群众性是有很大帮助的。但由于我们对依靠群众办好刊物的认识还不够，同时也因干部力量不足，因此形成对通讯员来稿、读者来信处理不够及时，有时还有严重的积压现象（最严重时积压半年以上）。每月数千份的小测验没有很好地处理，只是挑出其中较好者发给奖品，没有通过小测验发现积极分子，巩固与他们的联系。这就使“支部生活”不能充分地从下而上地了解群众中的问题、情况，加以分析提高，对群众进行教育，直接影响到刊物的思想性、群众性。
    四、与各级党委和有关领导机关的结合问题：办好党刊，除了做好群众工作，从下而上地了解群众中的问题外，必须与有关领导机关特别是各级党委结合，取得帮助与支持；从上而下地了解领导意图、工作计划和工作中问题，根据这些，结合群众中的问题进行教育。所以与各级党委和有关领导机关的结合是决定“支部生活”思想性、指导性的一个决定性的条件，这正是贯彻全党办刊的具体表现。“支部生活”从创刊就是由中共天津市委直接办的一个刊物，不过最初是由市委组织部负责编辑工作，因而刊物内容偏重于对支部工作的指导，以后转由市委宣传部负责编辑工作，这样就可以与支部教育、工人教育密切相结合。此外，“支部生活”还需要获得各厂矿党委、区委、工会的帮助与支持。“支部生活”在各党委、区委建立了兼职的通讯干事，领导本单位通讯工作和向“支部生活”反映情况；请有关领导机关（市委组织部、工会文教部、市委党校）负责同志组成编委会。“支部生活”曾经常主动找工会、市委组织部了解情况，约请撰写稿件，使“支部生活”在结合中心工作上日有改进。但由于我们对全党办刊这一原则认识不足，所以没有很好地领导起通讯工作，也没有很好地发挥编委会作用。因此，没有很好取得各级党委与有关领导机关的指导与有力的帮助，也是影响到“支部生活”思想性不强的重要原因之一。
    根据以上情况，“支部生活”今后应作以下改进：
    一、加强思想性：在编辑方针、编辑思想上应明确地了解一定时期、一个运动中集中地解决带根本性质的思想问题是什么，据此订出一定时期的编辑计划，以便有计划、有步骤地解决这些思想问题，较重大思想问题可组织讨论。同时拟加强对支部工作的指导，“支部工作讲话”一栏应改变一般地讲解支部工作任务为结合各个中心工作讲解支部怎样完成任务。只要“支部生活”做到在一定时期真正解决一两个较重要的思想问题，思想性、战斗性就能大大提高一步。
    二、进一步通俗化：进一步贯彻“从近到远、从具体到抽象”的通俗化原则，减少以至克服概念式灌输现象，“党课”、“问答”栏中注意多用活人活事说明道理。注意提高通俗化，避免因词害意和庸俗化现象。为了进一步实现内容和形式的多样化，逐步增加和恢复“讨论会”（组织读者讨论较重要的思想问题）以及封底图片（登载党员工作、学习、生活的照片等）。同时配合速成识字法的学习，增加关于共产主义与共产党的课文，每期编写一、二百字，旁附注音符号，以便阅读。
    三、加强群众工作：明确地认识依靠群众办好党刊的这一根本群众路线，逐步团结、培养更多的通讯员和积极分子在“支部生活”周围，给“支部生活”反映情况，撰写稿件。我们拟做好下面两件主要工作：（1）今后一个月中，通过清理积稿，在各个国营企业党委建立的通讯干事，恢复一月一次的通讯干事会议等通联工作；（2）处理好读者来信，做到一般来信有问必答，并在其中联系一批积极分子。
    其它如进一步贯彻全党办刊、加强发行工作，都是我们应该努力的项目。
