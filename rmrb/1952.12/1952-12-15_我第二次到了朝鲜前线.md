    I Have Come to the Korean Front for the Second Time
    Yu Sufufu, Vice Leader of the Second Delegation of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, Uyghur Representative

    Last year and this year, I represented the fraternal ethnic groups of the Northwest in participating in the Chinese People's Delegations to Korea to comfort the front lines.

    My overall impression from visiting Korea twice is that the Chinese and Korean People's forces are growing stronger with each battle. When I arrived in Korea last year, I still saw many remnants of enemy tanks, cars, and other weapons along the way. Today, the situation is different. The roads have been repaired, the streets have been renovated, bridges have been erected, and traffic is proceeding without hindrance.

    Last year, enemy planes flew very low, bombing cities and villages everywhere, destroying roads, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs, and smoke and fire were everywhere. But now, it is not easy to see enemy planes during the day; even if you see them, they fly very, very high and dare not run rampant. At night, they can only randomly drop a bunch of bombs and rockets. Therefore, our transport vehicles operate as usual, and even drive as usual during the day.

    The towns in the rear of Korea are gradually becoming lively, and some places are under construction, filled with cheerful and victorious songs everywhere. No matter who you ask, they will answer: We will surely win, and victory belongs to us. The facts of the past two years have also proven this. Volunteer soldiers recounted their combat situation and said: We have overcome various difficulties. In the five battles last year, we were sometimes hungry for three or four days, eating only fried flour, staying on the snow, using rifles to shoot down enemy planes, and using grenades to hit tanks. When the bullets ran out, we used stones to hit them. Under such difficult conditions, we drove the enemy from the Yalu River all the way to the 38th parallel; today, with the support of the people of the motherland, we have new weapons to deal with the enemy, our own tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and airplanes. Our technology has also greatly improved, we will definitely achieve greater victories, and we have a firm belief in achieving final victory.

    This is the fact, the truth. The changes in the past year are almost unimaginable. Young soldiers have not only received airplanes and anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland, but have also mastered modern combat technology. Artillery soldiers said: With our artillery on the position, enemy tanks cannot advance. Our anti-aircraft gun experts have subdued the enemy planes. When I went to Korea last year, I heard the aviators who were studying say: We are the sons and daughters of workers and peasants from the free motherland. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have obtained the opportunity to master various technologies. We cannot tolerate the barbaric behavior of American air bandits in Korea. We must learn technology well, fight the enemy, and guarantee the independence of Korea, the security of the motherland, and peace in the Far East and the world. Today, these heroes have realized their promises, and they have given the enemy an incurable "shock disease." Young heroes such as Zhao Baotong and Zhang Jihui have made the enemy terrified, and even Davis, the "ace" pilot of American imperialism, has been shot down by us.

    I am one of the representatives of ethnic minorities from Xinjiang, who live on the border of the motherland. Our ethnic minority representatives, like other representatives, met commanders at all levels of the Volunteer Army Headquarters and met General Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people. Whether commanders, combatants, Korean people – workers, farmers, students, men, women, old and young – all welcomed us with unparalleled enthusiasm. Some people were even moved to tears when they saw the delegation, and they felt even closer to our ethnic minority representatives. They gave us their most cherished gifts. Soldier Xu Lianzhen entrusted a letter to the delegation, along with 400,000 yuan. He said: "I am infinitely excited to hear about the rapid progress of the motherland's construction. I cannot directly participate in the motherland's construction now. I will save 400,000 yuan from my life in the war zone and send it to the motherland as funds for construction! Although the money is not much, I think it can buy some nails." How much our Volunteer Army heroes love the motherland!

    Let us, the happy fraternal ethnic groups living in the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, learn the great patriotism and internationalism of the Volunteer Army soldiers who are fighting heroically on the Korean front, devote ourselves to the great economic construction of the motherland, and work hard for victory, for lasting peace in the Far East and the world!

    Northern Korea has had a bumper harvest this year. Volunteer soldiers happily help Korean farmers harvest the fertile crops. Don't be afraid of enemy planes coming to make trouble, we have anti-aircraft guns to cover us.

### 我第二次到了朝鲜前线

    我第二次到了朝鲜前线
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第二分团副团长  维吾尔族代表  玉苏甫夫
    去年和今年，我曾经代表西北各兄弟民族，两次参加中国人民赴朝慰问团到朝鲜前线进行慰问。
    我两次到达朝鲜，总的印象是：中朝人民部队是越战越强了。去年到朝鲜时，沿途还看到许多敌人遗下的坦克车、汽车及其他武器的残骸。今天的情形不同了，道路修复了，街道修整了，桥梁架起了，交通毫无阻碍地进行着。
    去年，敌人的飞机飞得很低，到处轰炸城市、乡村，破坏道路，投下燃烧弹和炸弹，到处冒着烟火。而现在，白天是不容易看到敌人的飞机了；即使看到了，也是飞得很高很高，不敢任意横行了。在黑夜，它们也只能胡乱地扔一顿炸弹和火箭。因此，我们的运输车辆好像平时似地照样行驶，甚至白天也可以照常行车。
    朝鲜后方的城镇逐渐热闹起来了，有的地方在进行建设，到处洋溢着愉快和胜利的歌声。不管你问任何人，他们都回答道：我们一定胜利，胜利是属于我们的。两年来的事实也证明了这一点。志愿军战士们叙述着自己作战情况说：我们克服了各种困难。去年的五次战役中，我们有时甚至三、四天一直饿着，只吃炒面，住宿在雪地上，以步枪打敌机，以手榴弹打坦克，子弹打完就用石头打。在这样艰苦的条件下，我们把敌人从鸭绿江一直赶到三八线；今天在祖国人民的支援下，我们有了对待敌人的新武器，有了自己的坦克、高射炮和飞机。我们的技术也大大提高了，我们一定能取得更大的胜利，并有坚定的信念取得最后胜利。
    这是事实，是真理。一年来的变化几乎是不可想像的。年青战士们不仅收到了祖国人民捐送的飞机、高射炮，而且已经掌握了近代化作战技术。炮兵战士们说：有我们的炮在阵地上，敌人的坦克怎么也不能前进的。我们的高射炮能手们已经把敌人的飞机制服了。去年我到朝鲜时，听到正在学习中的航空员们说：我们是自由祖国的工农子弟，今天在共产党和毛主席领导下，取得了掌握各种技术的机会，我们不能忍受美国空中强盗在朝鲜的野蛮行为，我们一定学好技术，打击敌人，保证朝鲜的独立、祖国的安全和远东及全世界的和平。今天这些英雄们把自己的诺言实现了，他们已经使敌人害了不可挽救的“吃惊病”。赵宝桐、张积慧等年青英雄们，已使敌人心惊胆战，美帝国主义的“王牌”飞行员戴维斯也被我们击毙了。
    我是居住在祖国边疆的新疆少数民族代表之一。我们少数民族代表和其他代表一样，见到了志愿军司令部各级指挥员，见到了朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成将军。无论指挥员、战斗员、朝鲜人民——工人、农民、学生，男女老幼，都以无比的热情欢迎我们。有些人看到慰问团来，甚至感动得流下眼泪，他们对我们少数民族代表更觉亲切。他们把自己最珍爱的礼物赠给我们。战士徐连珍向慰问团交托了一封信，并附有四十万元。他说：“我听到祖国建设的突飞猛进，感到无限兴奋。我现在不能直接参加祖国的建设事业，在战地生活中节省下来四十万元送给祖国做建设事业的资金吧！钱虽不多，我想可买一些钉子用。”我们的志愿军英雄是多么热爱祖国啊！
    让我们生活在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国的幸福的兄弟民族人民，学习在朝鲜前线英勇战斗的志愿军战士们伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神，投入祖国伟大的经济建设事业，为胜利，为远东和全世界的持久和平而努力吧！
