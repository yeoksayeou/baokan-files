(New China News Agency, Moscow, 3rd dispatch) According to TASS, Moscow: Ivan Petrovsky, President of Moscow State University and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, delivered a report entitled "The Soviet People's Struggle to Defend and Consolidate Peace" at the Fourth All-Soviet Peace Congress on the 2nd. He said: It has been exactly one year since we held the Third All-Soviet Peace Congress. This year has been a year of peaceful construction for the Soviet people, and a year in which our economy, culture, and science have achieved new successes. At the same time, this year, like previous years, has been a year of unremitting struggle by the Soviet people to defend and consolidate world peace and to implement the Stalinist foreign policy of peace pursued by the Soviet government, namely, a policy of friendship and peaceful cooperation with all countries.

Petrovsky said: We are holding the Fourth All-Soviet Peace Congress on the eve of the Vienna World Peace Congress, which is a major international event this year. After discussing the enthusiastic preparations of people from all over the world to participate in the World Peace Congress, he emphasized: The Soviet people warmly support the holding of the World Peace Congress. Our country has launched extensive preparations for the World Peace Congress. In the past three months alone, the Soviet Peace Committee and the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge have held more than 50,000 lectures and reports, introducing the struggles of people from all countries to defend peace. Trade unions, youth, women, and other mass organizations have also conducted this work on a large scale. At the initiative of the Soviet Peace Committee, rallies held in Moscow and other Soviet cities to protest against the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea and China and the abuse of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have received enthusiastic responses. Petrovsky said: The delegates elected by this All-Soviet Peace Congress to attend the World Peace Congress will demonstrate the ardent desire of the entire Soviet people to maintain and strengthen peace and to develop and consolidate close cooperation with people from all countries in culture, science, and economic development.

Petrovsky then detailed the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people's peaceful construction work in industry, agriculture, culture, education, and people's living welfare, and introduced the content of the large-scale new Five-Year Plan. He emphasized that the enemies of peace are doing everything possible to slander the Soviet Union, trying to insist that the Soviet Union has aggressive intentions. However, after visiting the Soviet Union, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world with different professions, statuses, political and religious beliefs have unanimously reached the same conclusion based on Soviet reality: the Soviet people are peace-loving people, the Soviet Union is a country engaged in peaceful creative endeavors, a country where science, culture, and art are flourishing, and a country where peaceful economy and the people's material well-being are constantly progressing. The truth about the Soviet Union has penetrated the hearts of hundreds of millions of people in various countries, and no one can succeed in concealing this truth.

Petrovsky analyzed the current international situation, discussed the crimes of the American imperialists and their vassal states in invading Korea, and their frantic arms race around the world and the intensification of fascism at home. He pointed out: The American and British aggressors are carrying out a predatory war in Korea under the banner of the United Nations. They not only do not accept reasonable proposals for an armistice in Korea, but on the contrary, they are intensifying pressure on the countries under their control, inciting war psychology, and attempting to expand aggression in the Far East. People all over the world were shocked to learn about the unprecedented atrocities of the American war-mongers, the massacres of entire groups of Korean women, children, and the elderly, and their deaths from severe bacterial infections. However, the people of all countries, including the Soviet people, cannot be passive in the face of the evil policies of the instigators of new wars. The democratic movement of the masses to defend peace is developing on an ever-expanding scale. It has become an unstoppable movement in our time. It has achieved great success in exposing the evil conspiracies of war-mongers, maintaining peace, and preventing a new world war. And it will achieve even greater success.

Petrovsky continued: The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing in October this year was a powerful demonstration of the strength of the masses of people struggling for peace. Representatives from 37 countries with a population of 1.6 billion expressed the opinions of people from all walks of life. Although they belonged to different political parties and organizations and represented various religious denominations, this did not prevent them from agreeing on the main issue of maintaining and strengthening peace. This conference irrefutably proved that the people of all countries are united in the struggle for peace and that they are firmly determined to maintain international peace and security. The Soviet people warmly support the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. We believe that the Soviet delegation we have elected to attend the World Peace Congress will fully support the demands and proposals of the people of the Asian and Pacific region regarding the maintenance and strengthening of peace put forward in the resolutions.

Petrovsky said: The Soviet people unanimously condemn the policy of the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France aimed at launching another world war. We denounce the United States for using the banner of the United Nations to conceal its aggression in Korea, and demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea, the signing of an armistice agreement under fair conditions based on adherence to international law, customs, treaties and conventions, and then taking new steps in the near future to ensure a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and enable the Korean people to handle their internal affairs themselves. He also said that the Soviet people firmly condemn the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare, demand an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction; demand an end to the remilitarization of Germany and Japan; support national independence; and demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. At the World Peace Congress, the representatives of the Soviet people will cooperate closely with the representatives of all other countries participating in the Congress and give them full support, as long as those representatives have a sincere desire to find common paths to stop the ongoing war and prevent new wars. Petrovsky emphasized that genuine peace fighters in all countries can firmly rely on the unlimited support of the Soviet people in their noble struggle for peace and international security.

Petrovsky concluded: We warmly welcome the World Peace Congress and wish it success. We fully support the various effective activities of the World Peace Council aimed at developing and strengthening the movement to maintain peace and prevent the danger of new wars. Let us further intensify our unity and fight to defend peace and against the instigators of new wars! Let us support the great cause of peace!

    在第四届全苏拥护和平大会上
    彼得罗夫斯基发表报告
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联国立莫斯科大学校长、科学院院士伊凡·彼得罗夫斯基二日在第四届全苏拥护和平大会上发表了题为“苏联人民为保卫和巩固和平而斗争”的报告。他说：自从我们举行第三届全苏拥护和平大会以后，到现在恰好是一年了。这一年是苏联人民从事和平建设劳动的一年，是我国经济、文化和科学获得新成就的一年。同时，这一年正如以往各年一样，是苏联人民为保卫和巩固全世界的和平、为贯彻实施苏联政府斯大林和平外交政策，即和各国友好及和平合作的政策而进行不屈不挠的斗争的一年。
    彼得罗夫斯基说：我们是在维也纳世界人民和平大会前夕举行第四届全苏拥护和平大会的，维也纳大会是今年的一桩重大国际事件。他在谈述了世界各国人民热烈筹备参加世界人民和平大会的情况后强调说：苏联人民热烈拥护世界人民和平大会的召开。我国已为世界人民和平大会展开了广泛的准备工作。单说过去三个月来，苏联拥护和平委员会和苏联政治与科学知识普及协会就已举行过五万多次讲演会和报告会，介绍各国人民保卫和平的斗争。各工会、青年、妇女和其他群众组织也大规模地进行了这种工作。根据苏联拥护和平委员会的倡议，在莫斯科和苏联其他城市举行的抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器、虐待朝中战俘大会等，都得到了热烈的响应。彼得罗夫斯基说：本届全苏拥护和平大会选出的出席世界人民和平大会的代表，将表明苏联全国人民热烈希望维护和加强和平、发展和巩固在文化、科学以及经济发展方面和各国人民的密切合作。
    彼得罗夫斯基接着就工业、农业、文化、教育、人民生活福利等方面详述了苏联人民和平建设劳动的辉煌成就，并介绍了规模宏大的新五年计划的内容。他强调指出：和平的敌人千方百计诽谤苏联，企图硬说苏联有侵略意图。但世界各国成千上万的职业不同、地位不同、政治和宗教信仰不同的人们访问苏联后，苏联的现实使他们一致得到了相同的结论：苏联人民是爱好和平的人民，苏联是从事和平创造性的努力的国家，是科学、文化和艺术繁荣昌盛的国家，是和平经济和人民物质生活福利不断获得进展的国家。关于苏联的真理已深入各国千百万人民的心坎，无论任何人要想掩盖这种真理都是不会成功的。
    彼得罗夫斯基分析了目前的国际形势，谈述了美帝国主义者及其仆从国家侵略朝鲜的罪行，以及他们在全世界范围内疯狂备战并在国内加紧法西斯化的情况。他指出：美、英侵略者打着联合国的旗帜，在朝鲜进行着掠夺性的战争。他们不仅不接受关于朝鲜停战的合理建议，相反地，他们在加紧对于受他们支配的各国施加压力，煽动战争心理，企图在远东扩大侵略。全世界人士知道了美国战争贩子旷古未闻的暴行，知道了整批朝鲜妇女、儿童和老人被屠杀、感染严重病菌而死时，莫不大吃一惊。但是，世界各国人民，包括苏联人民在内，在新战争挑拨者的罪恶政策面前不能处于被动的地位。群众的保卫和平的民主运动正在以不断扩大的规模发展着。它已经成为我们这个时代不可遏制的运动。它在揭露战争贩子的罪恶阴谋、维护和平、阻止新世界战争方面，已经获得了极大的成就。并且还将获得更多的成就。
    彼得罗夫斯基接着说：今年十月在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，是为和平而斗争的人民群众的力量的强大示威。拥有十六亿人口的三十七个国家的代表，表达了各阶层人民的意见。虽然他们属于不同的政党、组织，代表各种宗教教派，然而这决不妨碍他们在解决关于维护与加强和平的主要问题上意见一致。这个会议不容争辩地证明了各国人民一致为和平而斗争，证明了他们坚决维护国际和平与安全的事业的不可动摇的决心。苏联人民热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议。我们相信我们选出的出席世界人民和平大会的苏联代表团，将充分支持决议中所提出来的亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民关于维护与加强和平的要求和提案。
    彼得罗夫斯基说：苏联人民一致谴责美、英、法三国统治集团旨在发动另一次世界大战的政策。我们斥责美国用联合国的旗帜掩饰它在朝鲜进行的侵略，并要求立即在朝鲜停火，以遵守国际公法、惯例、条约和公约为基础，在公正的条件下签订停战协定，然后在最近将来采取新的步骤，以保证和平解决朝鲜问题，并使朝鲜人民能够自己处理他们的内政。他又说，苏联人民坚决谴责美国进行细菌战，要求无条件禁止原子武器、细菌武器及其他大规模杀人的武器；要求制止德国和日本重新军国主义化；拥护各民族独立；要求缔结五大国和平公约。在世界人民和平大会上，苏联人民的代表们将和参加大会的其他一切国家的组织的代表密切合作，并予以充分支持，只要那些代表都抱着真诚的愿望来寻觅共同的途径，以制止正在进行的战争并防止新的战争。彼得罗夫斯基强调说：各国真诚的和平战士在他们为和平和国际安全而进行的崇高斗争中，可以坚决依赖苏联人民的无限支持。
    彼得罗夫斯基最后说：我们热烈欢迎世界人民和平大会，并祝大会工作成功。我们完全赞成世界和平理事会旨在开展并加强维护和平与防止新战争危险的运动的各种有效活动。让我们更进一步加紧团结，为保卫和平、为反对新战争的煽动者而斗争！让我们拥护伟大的和平事业！
