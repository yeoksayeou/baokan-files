To the Editor:

    Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, countless men and women have freely found their soulmates and formed countless happy new families. They have joined the national movement to increase production and practice economy, working actively and living happily. However, because the Marriage Law has not been universally implemented in every corner and has not penetrated deeply into everyone's heart, many women still suffer tragic deaths at the hands of their husbands or mothers-in-law while fighting against feudal marriages, and these tragedies continue to occur.

    Zhao Sanxiao of Youfangbao Village, Seventh District, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, threatened his wife when she filed for divorce, saying, "Divorce, will you? Alive, you're a member of my family; dead, you're a ghost of my family!" In May of this year, he stabbed his wife to death with scissors on the way to sending her back to her parents' home. Later, he himself committed suicide by jumping into a well, fearing punishment for his crime. Such incidents are not isolated. It is known that more than ten cases of women being murdered have occurred in Pingyao County alone in the past year. Cases of abuse and beatings are even more uncountable. On a provincial and national scale, the numbers must be even more staggering. The situation of feudal families restricting the freedom of marriage for men and women is also very tragic. A woman in Xing Village, Fifth District, Pingyao County, confined her daughter at home, preventing her from going out, because her daughter was in love with someone else. As a result, the girl died of anger. Another old man, because his daughter freely married someone else, put a white paper strip on his door saying, "My daughter is dead, dead!" and cried loudly. Another deviation is that some young men and women are not cautious about marriage, or do not choose partners based on politics or labor performance, but are greedy for "enjoyment." For example, some women want to take "three sets of clothes, two pairs of shoes, gold teeth, watches, and gold rings" as conditions for accepting "love." Often, not long after marriage, their feelings break down, and they want a divorce again. Some conceal their age, pretending to be older than they are, unaware of the harm of early marriage.

    All of the above are violations of the Marriage Law. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to vigorously and continuously carry out propaganda about the Marriage Law. The Marriage Law must be popularized to every town and village and penetrate deeply into everyone's heart. Punishing the relevant criminals for implementing the Marriage Law is naturally necessary, but the fundamental way is to make everyone understand the benefits of the Marriage Law ideologically.

    对贯彻婚姻法的意见
    编辑同志：婚姻法颁布以来，无数男女都自由地找到了自己情投意合的爱人，组成了无数美满的新家庭。他们卷入了祖国的增产节约运动中，在积极地劳动着，幸福地生活着。但由于婚姻法还没有普遍贯彻到每一个角落，还没有深入到每一个人的心底，以致还有许多妇女为和封建婚姻作斗争而惨遭丈夫或婆婆杀害，这种悲剧不断发生。
    山西平遥县七区油房堡村赵三小，他的妻子提出离婚时，他威胁说：“你离吧！活是俺家人，死是俺家鬼！”今年五月间，他送妻子回娘家的路上，竟用剪刀把妻子刺死。后来他自己也畏罪跳井自杀。这样的事件不是少数。已经知道的，仅平遥县一年来就曾经发生过妇女被杀害的案件十多起。虐待、打骂一类的现象更无法计算。全省、全国来说，那一定更惊人了。就说封建家庭束缚男女婚姻自由的情况，也很惨痛。平遥县五区邢村一妇女，因为她的女儿和别人恋爱，她便把女儿关在家里不让外出。结果那女孩竟活活地气愤而死。又有一老汉，因女儿和别人自由结婚，他就在门上贴白纸条说：“俺女儿死啦，死啦！”并放声大哭。另一种偏向，有的青年男女对待婚姻问题是不慎重的，或不是从政治上、从劳动的表现上选择对象，而是贪图“享受”。如有的妇女要拿“三身衣服、两双鞋，金牙、手表、金戒指”作为接受“爱情”的条件，往往结婚后没多少日子，感情就破裂了，又要离婚。有的则隐瞒年龄，以小充大，不知早婚的害处。
    上述种种，都是违反婚姻法的。所以我认为必须大力地、长期地进行关于婚姻法的宣传。必须使婚姻法普及到每一个城镇、乡村，深入到每一个人的心底。为贯彻婚姻法而惩办有关的罪犯，自然是需要的，但根本的办法还是使人人从思想上认识婚姻法的好处。
