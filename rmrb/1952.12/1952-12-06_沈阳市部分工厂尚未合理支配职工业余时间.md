    Some Factories in Shenyang Have Not Rationally Arranged Employees' Leisure Time
    ——Reader's Letters and Commentary
    
    To rationally arrange employees' leisure time is an urgent demand of the broad masses of workers, and it is also a current political task for Party organizations in factories and mines across various regions. The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee issued a "Decision on the Issue of Arranging Leisure Time for Employees in State-Owned and Publicly-Owned Factories" on December 15, 1951, stipulating that the employees’ leisure activity time should not exceed two hours per day, to ensure their physical health, regular political, cultural, and technical learning, and the implementation of production tasks and various central tasks. At the same time, the experience of the Wu-San Factory in rationally arranging employees’ leisure time was circulated to various factories for learning. This decision of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee was entirely correct. The issuance of the decision also achieved certain results. First, the chaotic phenomenon of administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations vying for leisure time in some factories began to be overcome. Under the unified leadership of the Party organization, employees' leisure time was allocated more rationally according to the needs of factory work at various stages. Therefore, the leisure time needed to implement various central tasks was guaranteed. Some factories also basically ensured employees' cultural and technical learning and relatively shortened employees’ leisure time. These are all good aspects. However, it must be pointed out that because the Industrial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, which directly leads the Party work of various factories, relaxed its specific organizational leadership and supervision and inspection work in implementing this decision, the phenomenon of excessive leisure time for employees, excessive physical fatigue of employees, and failure to guarantee learning still exists in most factories in Shenyang nearly a year after the decision was issued. Some workers wrote to this newspaper and questioned, "The factory does not follow the Municipal Committee's decision, why doesn't the Industrial Department of the Municipal Committee care?" The workers' questioning is justified.
    
    According to workers' letters, the phenomenon of excessive leisure time for employees is relatively common and serious in various factories in Shenyang. Taking the model factory in Shenyang, the Smelting Plant, as an example, the average worker spends three hours a day in leisure activities. Party and League members, trade union group leaders, and activists (who account for about one-third of the total number of employees) need more than three hours. The leisure time of cadres is even longer. Individual workshop cadres who have not been separated from production and hold many concurrent positions can only sleep for three or four hours a day when they work the night shift. The situation in the No. 1 Machinery Factory is basically the same in this regard. The situation in the Shenyang Cigarette Factory is even worse. The workers' leisure time is more than 20 hours per week. There is only one hour of rest at noon, which is used for both eating and meetings. Since August of this year, the Shenyang Decoration Factory has required employees to produce for nine hours a day and spend three hours in leisure activities. Employees of the No. 3 Machinery Factory work for eight hours a day and spend more than three and a half hours in leisure activities.
    
    What are the results of excessive leisure time for employees? One-third of the workers in the Shenyang Smelting Plant cannot participate in cultural learning, and technical learning is also irregular. Since the end of 1950, the learning time of employees in the No. 1 Machinery Factory has been frequently disrupted. Comrade Wang Wenshan, the director of the second workshop of the factory and a model worker in the Shenyang industrial sector, felt that his cultural level was low and could not keep up with the rapidly changing work needs, and urgently requested to study culture. However, his legitimate request has not yet been met. So, what is so much of the employees' leisure time used for? Meetings, meetings, and more meetings. According to statistics from the smelting department of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, they have a total of 36 types of meetings per month (not 36 meetings). It is common for a grassroots cadre to receive three or four meeting notices at the same time in the factory. Some workers in the lead electrolysis workshop of the factory have to hold "ideological comparison meetings" every day (except Sundays) to examine their thoughts. Of course, strengthening the ideological education of workers is correct and beneficial to production, but excessively holding meetings and failing to guarantee the time necessary for workers to recover from fatigue and study is wrong and ultimately detrimental to production.
    
    The excessive leisure time of employees in some factories in Shenyang has reached the point of harming the workers' health and hindering safe production. In the third workshop of the Shenyang Cigarette Factory, including the five major groups, there are 80 people in total, with an average of 11 people on sick leave every day. Cui Bingxin of the Shenyang Smelting Plant is the security team leader, the Communist Youth League branch secretary, the Party's propagandist, and a member of the trade union committee. He often attends meetings during the day and works at night. Now he is recuperating due to illness. Guan Shilin, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the lead blast furnace workshop of the factory, also fell asleep while holding the settling pot when tapping lead due to excessive meetings and physical fatigue. Inadvertently, the hot lead water poured onto the ground, almost causing a serious accident. It is not difficult to imagine that such a situation will cause significant damage to production.
    
    Why has this correct decision of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee not been well implemented? This is certainly related to the objective situation such as the fact that enterprise management work has not yet been put on the right track and there are many political reform movements, but the main reason is that the Industrial Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee has made bureaucratic mistakes in leading this work, with only general arrangements and no specific leadership and necessary inspections. In addition to issuing the decision, they did not first conduct a key experiment in implementing the decision in one or two factories; even for the "experience of the Wu-San Factory in rationally arranging employees’ leisure activities" that was circulated, they did not conduct serious research and summarization. Because they fundamentally ignored the leadership method of "combining the general with the individual" repeatedly instructed by the Central Committee. This also made the factories lack specific leadership and methods in implementing the decision, and even excused themselves by saying that "the conditions of the Wu-San Factory are special" and relaxed their learning. Since the Municipal Committee's Industrial Department could not use the leadership method of breaking through one point, absorbing experience, and guiding the overall situation, and lacked regular and practical inspection work in the process of implementing this decision, the situation that the decision failed to be implemented could not be corrected in time. As for the further implementation of the decision, the issues of unifying the leadership pace of the municipal-level Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and the working methods and cooperation of the factory-level Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League after rationally solving the employees' leisure time, and streamlining unnecessary organizational structures, were naturally even more lacking in research. It is especially regrettable that in September of this year, after the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions reported to the Municipal Committee the serious situation that some factories had not effectively implemented the decision, they were still satisfied with the bureaucratic leadership method of sitting in the office and issuing instructions, and simply reissued the decision issued at the end of 1951 to various factories, without taking further practical and effective specific leadership.
    
    Why does the Shenyang Municipal Committee Industrial Department lead this work with a bureaucratic attitude? It cannot be denied that this is due to their insufficient understanding of the importance of ensuring that employees have enough rest and study time. The reason why they did not put this important issue, which is directly related to doing a good job in production, ensuring employees' health, and improving employees' political, cultural, and technical levels, on the agenda for research and resolution, reflects to a certain extent that they, like some factory cadres, believe that implementing this decision is in conflict with other central tasks, and that "other central tasks cannot be completed according to the Municipal Committee's regulations." Therefore, they have shown a lack of determination to implement the decision. This is an ideological obstacle to the reason why the Municipal Committee's decision has not been well implemented.
    
    The situation of excessive leisure time for employees in some factories in Shenyang is not allowed to continue and must be resolved immediately. Now, the Industrial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee has begun to pay attention to this work. We hope that the leading cadres and employees of various factories and mines in Shenyang will work together to implement this decision and promptly inform us of the situation and problems in implementing the decision. At the same time, it is recommended that other city party committees learn from this lesson and put the issue of rationally resolving employees' leisure time on the agenda. Areas that have not yet paid attention to this issue should immediately consider the steps and methods to solve it, and lead the solution to the phenomenon of excessive leisure activities, excessive meetings, and excessive concurrent positions for cadres; areas that have already made arrangements should earnestly check the implementation of the decision and solve the problems that occur in the implementation.

### 沈阳市部分工厂尚未合理支配职工业余时间

    沈阳市部分工厂尚未合理支配职工业余时间
    ——读者来信述评
    合理支配职工业余活动时间，是广大工人群众的迫切要求，同时也是各地厂矿党的组织当前的一项政治任务。中共沈阳市委员会在一九五一年十二月十五日就发出“关于国、公营工厂职工业余活动时间支配问题的决定”，规定工厂职工业余活动时间每日不得超过两小时，以保证职工的身体健康和经常的政治、文化、技术学习，以及生产任务和各种中心工作的贯彻；同时并把五三工厂合理支配职工业余活动时间的经验通报各厂学习。中共沈阳市委员会这一决定是完全正确的。决定发布以后也是收到一定成效的，首先是部分工厂中行政、工会、青年团等组织互相争用业余活动时间的混乱现象开始克服，在党组织的统一领导下，比较合理地按照各个阶段工厂工作的需要来分配职工的业余活动时间，因此贯彻各项中心工作所需要的业余活动时间也就有了保证；部分工厂还基本上保证了职工的文化、技术学习，并且相对地缩短了职工的业余活动时间。这些都是好的方面。但必须指出：由于直接领导各工厂党的工作的中共沈阳市委工业部，放松了对贯彻这一决定的具体组织领导和督促检查工作，以致在决定发布将近一年的今天，在沈阳市的大部分工厂中还存在着职工业余活动时间过长、职工身体过度疲劳和学习不能保证等现象。有的工人就写信给本报提出质问：“厂里不按市委的决定办事，为什么市委工业部也不管呀？”工人的质问是有理由的。
    根据工人来信反映，职工业余活动时间过长现象在沈阳市各工厂中是比较普遍而严重地存在着。以沈阳市的模范厂——冶炼厂为例，这个厂的一般工人群众每天业余活动时间达三小时；党、团员，工会小组长和积极分子等（这些人约占全体职工总人数的三分之一）则需三小时以上；干部业余活动时间就更长了，个别没有脱离生产而又兼职多的车间干部，在他们做夜班的时候，每天只能睡三、四个小时。机械一厂在这一方面的情形基本上也是一样。沈阳制烟厂的情形就更不好了。工人的业余活动时间每周达二十小时以上。中午只有一个钟头的休息时间，既要吃饭，又要开会。沈阳装具厂从今年八月份起，职工每天生产九小时，业余活动时间三小时。机械三厂职工每天生产八小时，业余活动时间三小时半以上。
    职工业余活动时间过长的结果是怎样呢？沈阳冶炼厂有三分之一的工人不能参加文化学习，技术学习也不正规。机械一厂从一九五○年年底以后，职工的学习时间便经常被打乱。该厂第二车间主任、沈阳市工业劳动模范王文山同志，因为感觉到自己文化水平低，跟不上日新月异的工作需要，迫切要求学习文化。但是他这一正当要求到现在还没有得到满足。那么究竟这么长的职工业余活动时间用来作什么呢？开会，开会，还是开会。根据沈阳冶炼厂熔炼部的统计，他们一个月共有三十六种会议
    （不是三十六次）。一个基层干部同时接到三、四个开会通知，这种情形在该厂是经常遇到的。该厂铅电解车间部分工人每天（除星期日外）都要开“思想对照会”来检查思想。当然，加强工人的思想教育是对的，对生产也是有好处的；但是过分地滥开会议，不能保证工人恢复疲劳和学习所必需的时间，则是错误的，归根到底对生产是不利的。
    沈阳市部分工厂职工业余活动时间过长的情形，已经达到损害工人身体健康和妨碍安全生产的地步。沈阳制烟厂三车间中包括五大组共八十人，平均每天有十一名病假。沈阳冶炼厂的崔炳信，是保安组长，青年团的支部书记，党的宣传员，工会委员。他经常白天开会，夜里干活，现在已经因病休养。该厂铅鼓风炉车间青年团支部书记关士林也因为开会过多，身体过度疲劳，出铅时手扶住沉淀锅便打起盹来，一失手，热腾腾的铅水便倾泻到地上去，几乎造成严重事故。不难想见，这样下去对生产是会有很重大的损害的。
    为什么中共沈阳市委员会这一正确的决定没有得到很好的贯彻呢？这和过去企业管理工作尚未步入正轨及各项政治改革运动较多等客观情况固然有关，但主要的是沈阳市委工业部在这个工作的领导上犯了官僚主义的毛病，只有一般的布置，没有具体的领导和必要的检查。他们除发布决定外，没有首先在一两个工厂作贯彻决定的重点试验；即使对所通报的“五三工厂合理支配职工业余活动的经验”，也没有作认真的研究和总结。因为他们根本忽视了中央一再指示的“一般与个别相结合”的领导方法。这也就使各厂矿在执行决定中缺少具体领导和办法，甚至藉口“五三工厂条件特殊”，而放松学习。市委工业部既然不能用突破一点，吸取经验，指导全盘的领导方法，而在这一决定贯彻的过程中，又缺少定期的、切实的检查工作，因此决定未能贯彻的情况也就不能及时纠正。至于进一步贯彻决定中必须解决的市级党、政、工、团的统一领导步调和厂级党、政、工、团在合理解决职工业余活动时间后的工作方法和工作配合问题，及精简不必要的组织机构等问题，当然也就更缺乏研究了。尤其遗憾的是，今年九月间，沈阳市总工会把有些工厂并未切实执行决定的严重情况向市委报告后，他们依然满足于坐在办公室里发指示的官僚主义领导方法，仅仅将一九五一年底发布的决定重新印发各厂，并未进一步采取切实有效的具体领导。
    沈阳市委工业部为什么以官僚主义的态度来领导这一工作呢？不能否认的，这是由于他们对保证职工有足够的休息时间和学习时间的重要性认识不足。他们所以没有把这个直接关系到搞好生产、保障职工身体健康和提高职工政治、文化和技术水平的重要问题提到议事日程上来研究和解决，这也就反映了他们在一定程度上也和某些工厂的干部一样，认为贯彻这一决定和其他中心工作有所矛盾，认为“按照市委的规定就不能完成其他的中心工作”，因而对贯彻决定表现得决心不够。这就是市委决定所以没有很好贯彻的一种思想障碍。
    沈阳市部分工厂职工业余活动时间过长的情形是不容许其继续存在的，也是必须立即加以解决的。现在中共沈阳市委工业部已经开始重视这一工作。我们希望沈阳各厂矿领导干部和职工共同努力贯彻这一决定，并将贯彻决定中的情况和问题及时告诉我们。同时建议其他城市党委接受这一教训，将合理解决职工业余活动时间问题提到议事日程上来。现在还没有注意这个问题的地区，应该立即考虑解决的步骤和办法，有领导地解决职工业余活动过多、会议过多、干部兼职过多的现象；已经有布置的地区，应该切实检查决定执行的情况，解决执行中所发生的问题。
