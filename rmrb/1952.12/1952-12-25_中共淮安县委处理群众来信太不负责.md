Editor's Note: In late April, reader Gao Shoupao wrote a letter listing many specific facts exposing Gao Bukuan, vice chairman of the Yubin Township Farmers' Association in Dingcheng District, Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, for shielding counter-revolutionaries, as well as engaging in corruption, and oppressing the people. In early May, we sent a letter to the CCP Huai'an County Committee asking them to be responsible for investigating and handling this issue. After we sent four letters on May 26, June 11, June 28, and July 15 to urge them, the Huai'an County Committee finally replied in late July, saying that Gao Bukuan did not shield counter-revolutionaries and that the materials revealed by the reader were not factual. The reply admitted that Gao Bukuan's "ideological consciousness and work style were not good enough, and sometimes even very bad," but did not offer any suggestions for education or handling the matter.

We studied the reply from the Huai'an County Committee and believed that this reply was very perfunctory and irresponsible. Therefore, in early August, we sent a letter to the CCP Yancheng Prefectural Committee asking them to be responsible for checking and handling this matter. In early September, the General Office of the Yancheng Prefectural Committee wrote to us saying that they had instructed the Huai'an County Committee to reinvestigate this issue. In late September, they wrote to us for the second time saying that, according to the reinvestigation results of the Huai'an County Committee, the materials revealed by reader Gao Shoupao were true. Gao Bukuan was a renegade who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and wormed his way into the Party, and the Huai'an County Committee had decided to take serious action against him.

Although the issue reported by reader Gao Shoupao has been correctly handled, we believe that the CCP Huai'an County Committee should review its irresponsible attitude in handling mass letters and make earnest corrections in future work. Now, we are publishing the reply letter from the CCP Huai'an County Committee in late July and the reply letter from the General Office of the CCP Yancheng Prefectural Committee below.

The CCP Huai'an County Committee's Reply Letter to This Newspaper in Late July

Comrades of the Readers' Letters Group of the People's Daily: We have received all the letters you sent. However, the materials were not investigated correctly for a while, and we were unable to reply in time. Now, we are reporting the investigation situation to you:

Gao Bukuan served as the village chief of Huangnigang Village from after liberation (December 1948) until the spring of 1949 when he became the vice chairman of the Township Farmers' Association. Since participating in work, this comrade's ideological consciousness and work style have not been good enough, and sometimes even very bad. This is manifested in the following aspects: 1. Corruption, engaging in illicit relationships with men and women; 2. Borrowing grain from the masses for several years and only returning it this year, affecting the production morale of the masses.

As for the issue of Gao Bukuan shielding the puppet Baozhang Gao Bucai, the investigation shows that this is not true. Because after Gao Bucai left home, the masses have not seen him return even once; and we have not heard that he has returned. According to the Dingcheng District Committee's understanding, Gao Shoupao had some previous biases against Gao Bukuan, so the reflected materials are exaggerated.

The CCP Yancheng Prefectural Committee General Office's Letter Reporting the Reinvestigation Results of the Huai'an County Committee

Comrades of the Readers' Letters Group of the People's Daily: The matter of reader Gao Shoupao's report about Gao Bukuan, vice chairman of the Yubin Township Farmers' Association in Dingcheng District, Huai'an County, shielding counter-revolutionaries and other illegal acts, has been proven true after reinvestigation by the Huai'an County Committee and the Dingcheng District Committee; this shows that the county committee's first investigation was rough and careless.

Gao Bukuan served as the village chief of Huanggang Village in the township as early as 1945 and joined the Chinese Communist Party. In 1946, when the enemy occupied Huai'an, he surrendered to the enemy through the bandit Baozhang Gao Bucai. After Huai'an was liberated in the winter of 1948, he returned, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and became the village chief of Huanggang Village; later, he joined the Party and became the vice chairman of the Township Farmers' Association.

The facts of his shielding counter-revolutionaries are as follows: Gao Bucai served as a bandit Baozhang during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War and committed great crimes. He reported to the enemy and arrested our township chief Yang Zhengliu and his son Yang Bufeng, causing both father and son to be tortured to death by electric shock, and one to die of illness in prison. He helped landlords and rich peasants recover 86 dan of rent grain and occupied the wife of martyr Yang Buhong. After Huai'an was liberated, he fled to Nanjing. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in March 1951, he was frightened and ran back, hiding at home for one night and living in relatives' homes for five days. It is said that he climbed over the wall into his home at night. At that time, militiaman Ni Shouyuan saw someone climbing over the wall of Gao Bucai's house, but did not know who it was, so he reported to the village militia platoon leader Gao Bushan. Gao Bushan told the militiamen "not to worry about these things." Gao Bushan is Gao Bukuan's younger brother; therefore, Gao Bukuan probably knew about Gao Bucai's return home. Some people also reported that Gao Bukuan stole the township government's seal and issued a certificate to Gao Bucai; no evidence has been found yet. After Gao Bucai left home, he went to Nanjing again and looked for Gao Shoupao. When Gao Shoupao wrote a letter back to the village to inquire about Gao Bucai's crimes, Gao Bukuan refused to reply and forwarded Gao Shoupao's letter to Gao Bucai's family. Analyzing from the above facts, it is justified to say that Gao Bukuan shielded Gao Bucai.

In addition, Gao Bukuan's younger brother, Gao Bushan, served in the bandit army and also had criminal activities. He should have been dealt with in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement; but under Gao Bukuan's protection, not only was he not dealt with, but he became the militia platoon leader of this village. Now, Gao Bushan has been removed from his post and is under mass supervision.

During the land reform in Huanggang Village, Gao Bukuan obtained 1.7 mu more land, and the land quality was also better than that of ordinary people. He also forcibly deducted Wang Kexi's 1.5 mu of land for his own cultivation, without paying public grain, and only registered and paid grain this year. In 1948, he embezzled three zhang of cloth from the fruits of struggle. He also had embezzlement behavior during the donation movement in 1951. He also engaged in improper relationships with men and women, which had a very bad influence.

Gao Bukuan had previously surrendered and defected, and now he violates laws and disciplines, and shields counter-revolutionaries. His character is extremely vile. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and state law, the county committee has decided to expel him from the Party and recommends that the county Farmers' Association remove him from his administrative post, and that the county People's Government take serious action against his illegal acts.

### 中共淮安县委处理群众来信太不负责

    中共淮安县委处理群众来信太不负责
    编者按：四月底，读者高寿保来信举出很多具体事实，揭发江苏淮安县丁澄区渔滨乡农会副会长高步宽包庇反革命分子以及贪污腐化、欺压人民等违法行为。五月初，我们就函请中共淮安县委会负责调查处理这个问题；经我们在五月二十六日、六月十一日、六月二十八日及七月十五日先后四次去信催促，淮安县委才在七月下旬答复我们说：高步宽并未包庇反革命分子，读者揭发的材料不是事实；答复中承认高步宽“思想意识和作风都不够好，有时甚至非常坏”，但却并不提出教育或处理的意见。
    我们研究了淮安县委的答复，认为这个答复是十分草率而不负责任的。于是，我们在八月初函请中共盐城地委会负责检查和处理这件事。九月初，盐城地委秘书处来信说：他们已责成淮安县委重新调查这个问题。九月底，他们第二次来信说：根据淮安县委重新调查结果，证明读者高寿保揭发的材料属实。高步宽是混入革命阵营并钻进党内的一个变节分子，淮安县委已决定对他作严肃的处理。
    读者高寿保检举的问题虽然已经得到了正确的处理，但是，我们认为，中共淮安县委应该对处理群众来信不负责任的错误态度进行检讨，并在今后工作中切实加以纠正。现在，我们把中共淮安县委七月底的答复信以及中共盐城地委秘书处的答复信发表在后面。
    中共淮安县委七月下旬给本报的答复信
    人民日报读者来信组负责同志：你们写来的信我们都收到了；但是材料一时未调查正确，未能及时答复。现将调查情况报告你们：
    高步宽从解放后（一九四八年十二月）就任黄泥岗村村长，到一九四九年春天任乡农会副会长。该同志从参加工作以来，思想意识和作风都不够好，有时甚至非常坏。表现在如下几方面：一、腐化，乱搞男女关系；二、借群众粮食数年直到今年才还，影响群众生产情绪。
    至于高步宽包庇伪保长高步才的问题，据调查并非事实。因为高步才离家后，群众尚未见他回来过一趟；而且也未听说回来过。据丁澄区委了解：高寿保与高步宽在以往有些成见，因此反映的材料有夸大之处。
    中共淮安县委员会
    中共盐池地委秘书处来信报告淮安县委重新调查的结果
    人民日报读者来信组同志：读者高寿保检举淮安县丁澄区渔滨乡农会副会长高步宽包庇反革命分子及其它非法行为一事，经淮安县委与丁澄区委重新调查，证明属实；这说明县委第一次调查是粗枝大叶的。
    高步宽在一九四五年即任该乡黄岗村村长，并参加中国共产党。一九四六年敌人占领淮安时，他通过匪保长高步才向敌人自首。一九四八年冬天淮安解放后，他又回来，混入革命阵营，做黄岗村村长；以后又入党，做乡农会副会长。
    他包庇反革命分子的事实如下：高步才在第三次国内革命战争中任匪保长，罪恶甚大。他曾报告敌人逮捕我乡长杨正柳及其子杨步凤，致他们父子两人一被电刑烤死，一个病死狱中。他曾帮助地主、富农倒回租粮八十六石，并霸占烈士杨步宏的妻子。淮安解放后，他逃亡到南京。一九五一年三月镇压反革命运动时，他曾被吓跑回来，躲在家里一夜，在亲戚家住了五天。到家时据说是夜里爬墙头进去的。当时民兵倪寿元看见有人从高步才家墙头上爬进去，但不知是什么人，就去报告村民兵分队长高步善。高步善却叫民兵“不要管这些”。高步善是高步宽的胞弟；因此，高步才回家的事高步宽可能知道。也有人反映，高步宽偷盖乡政府的印信，给高步才发证明；现尚未查出证据。高步才离家后又去南京，曾去找高寿保。高寿保写信回村查问高步才罪恶材料时高步宽不肯回信，并将高寿保的信转给高步才家里。从以上事实来分析，说高步宽包庇高步才是有根据的。
    此外，高步宽的弟弟高步善，当过匪军，也有过罪恶活动，在镇压反革命运动中应是处理对象；但在高步宽包庇下，不仅没被处理，反当了本村的民兵分队长。现在，高步善已被撤职，并受群众管制。
    高步宽在黄岗村土地改革时多得地一亩七分，土地质量也比一般群众好。他还强扣了汪克羲的一亩半田自种，不缴公粮，到今年才登记缴粮。一九四八年，他贪污斗争果实布三丈。一九五一年捐献运动中，他也有贪污行为。他还乱搞不正当的男女关系，影响很坏。
    高步宽以前既自首变节，现在又违法乱纪，包庇反革命分子，品质是极其恶劣的。为严肃党纪国法，县委已决定开除其党籍，并建议县农会撤销其行政职务，县人民政府对他的违法行为作严肃处理。
