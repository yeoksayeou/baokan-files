The rice stem borer is the most common pest in rice-producing areas, seriously threatening the production and lives of farmers. In 1949 alone, the loss of rice in Southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang amounted to 3 billion jin. According to historical data, in years with severe borer infestations, the national loss of rice exceeds 10 billion jin.

Over the past three years, borer control work has been gradually展开 in various regions, with some areas achieving significant results. For example, in Nanchang and 18 other counties in Jiangxi Province, the vigorous promotion of rice root treatment in the autumn and winter of 1950 resulted in a reduction in rice losses from borer infestations from over 288 million jin in 1950 to over 31 million jin in 1951. Some areas in Zhejiang Province have also achieved significant results.

In June 1952, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a "National Borer Control Symposium," summarizing experiences from various regions and unanimously affirming that "thoroughly handling rice roots in winter to kill overwintering rice stem borers is the fundamental method of borer control." However, the rice cultivation area in the country spans the Yangtze and Pearl River basins, including the East China, Central South, and Southwest administrative regions. To fully展开 this work, leaders at all levels must attach importance to it, fully mobilize the masses, form a massive borer control movement, and thoroughly handle rice roots in order to achieve universal effectiveness. To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Supervision of the Central People's Government jointly issued a notice and have dispatched cadres to key areas in East China and Central South for inspection. However, it is understood that various rice-producing areas have not yet given it universal attention. To more forcefully promote this movement, the following points are specifically reiterated:

(1) Leadership organs at all levels must clearly recognize that winter rice root treatment is the main key to borer control. To this end, all major rice-producing areas should promptly establish rice root treatment command posts to centrally lead the borer control work.

(2) Conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization to make thorough rice root treatment a common action of the broad masses of cadres and people, and promptly summarize and exchange experiences to guide the development of the movement.

(3) Agricultural departments at all levels must, in conjunction with the People's Supervision Committee, organize a certain number of cadres to inspect and promote the work at each level, and report and inform at any time.

    中央农业部关于冬季彻底处理稻根工作的指示
    螟虫是产稻区最普遍的害虫，严重威胁着农民的生产和生活。一九四九年仅苏南、浙江两地就损失稻谷三十亿斤。根据历史材料：螟害严重年份，全国损失稻谷在一百亿斤以上。
    三年来治螟工作已在各地逐步展开，部分地区并已获得显著成绩。如江西省南昌等十九县在一九五○年秋冬两季大力推行处理稻根工作，一九五一年螟害损失的稻谷即由两亿八千八百多万斤减到三千一百多万斤。浙江省部分地区也同样收到显著效果。
    一九五二年六月中央人民政府农业部召开“全国治螟座谈会”，总结各地经验，一致肯定“冬季彻底处理稻根，杀死过冬螟虫，是治螟的基本方法”。但全国水稻面积遍及长江、珠江两流域，包括华东、中南、西南三个大行政区；要全面展开这一工作，必须各级领导重视，充分发动群众，形成千军万马的治螟运动，彻底处理稻根，才能普遍生效。为此，中央人民政府农业部曾与中央人民监察委员会发布联合通知，并已派出干部分赴华东、中南两地重点检查，但据了解稻区各地尚未普遍重视。为了更有力地推动这一运动，特再提出下列各点：
    （一）各级领导机关必须明确认清冬季处理稻根是治螟的主要关键，为此，各主要产稻区应迅速成立处理稻根指挥部，统一领导治螟工作。
    （二）深入宣传动员，使彻底处理稻根工作成为广大干部和群众的共同行动，并及时总结交流经验，指导运动的开展。
    （三）各级农业部门必须结合人民监察委员会组织一定干部，逐级检查推动，随时通报汇报。
    中央人民政府农业部部长李书城
