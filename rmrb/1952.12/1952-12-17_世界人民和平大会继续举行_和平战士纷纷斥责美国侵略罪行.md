Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 15th: The World People's Peace Congress continued its sessions on the morning of the 15th. The meeting was chaired by George Haywood, the representative from the United States. Mrs. Blum made a statement regarding the Presidium meeting on the 14th. She said that the Presidium meeting had decided to establish three committees according to the agenda of the Congress: the Committee on National Independence and International Security, the Committee on Ending Current Wars, and the Committee on Easing International Tensions. The committees will begin their work when each issue has been discussed in the plenary session. These committees will hold their first meetings on the evening of the 15th to elect chairpersons.

The first speaker at the morning session on the 15th was Nohak Phongsavan, the representative from Laos. He said that the war of aggression waged by French imperialists with the help of the United States has continued for seven years. They have committed unprecedented crimes against the peaceful people of Laos and carried out barbaric massacres. He then described the lives of the people in the liberated areas of Laos, emphasizing the improvement of living standards and the development of culture and economy in the liberated areas. He concluded by saying that the Lao representatives attended the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, providing the first opportunity to explain to the representatives of various countries the situation of the Lao people's struggle for peace and freedom.

Argentine representative Norberto Frontini, in his speech, exposed the true nature of the United States' so-called "defense of the free world." He said that this hypocritical measure has turned into a war crime against humanity and against peace, as evidenced by the tragic fate of Korea. He then cited the bilateral military agreements concluded between the United States and Latin American countries as examples, pointing out that any country that accepts US military "aid" becomes a vassal of the United States. He emphasized that the only path to maintaining peace is peaceful cooperation, free trade, peaceful coexistence between countries with different political systems, and the liberation of peoples striving for independence. He finally called on the Congress to strive to promote negotiations between the five major powers and to conclude a peace pact that can be accepted by other countries.

Le Dinh Tham, the head of the Vietnamese delegation, spoke next, saying that the Vietnamese people, like the people of all countries in the world, place great hopes on the World People's Peace Congress. The people of Asian countries have risen up one after another, more and more resolutely fighting for peace, against colonial rule, and for national independence. They have fully understood and supported each other in this regard, and the great success of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is a significant proof of this.

Chaleom Phongs Kanlayanmit, the head of the Thai delegation, pointed out in his speech that the United States is increasingly blatantly interfering in Thailand's internal affairs, gradually turning Thailand into a military base, and making Thailand's economy increasingly subordinate to the interests of US strategy. In Thailand's budget for next year, 60 percent of the funds will be allocated to the army and police, while only 1 percent will be allocated to public health. The Korean War has claimed the lives of many Thai youths.

He then said that the Thai government, at the behest of Washington, is brutally suppressing peace advocates. Many peace advocates, including the chairman of the Thai Peace Committee, have been arrested. The Thai delegation in Vienna has been warned that if we return home, we will also be detained. Our crime is only advocating world peace.

Kanlayanmit finally requested, on behalf of the Thai delegation, that the representatives attending the Congress make every effort to immediately end the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya.

Next, Giuseppe Nitti, an Italian representative and member of parliament, spoke about the threat that the rearmament of West Germany, with US support, poses to the peoples of European countries. He then said that the movement for a peaceful solution to the German question has achieved great success, and more and more people are participating in this movement. In recent months, I have had the opportunity to meet many prominent leaders with different political views, especially prominent leaders in France and Belgium, who have all publicly opposed the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. Nitti also spoke about the parliamentary peace movement, saying that he had reason to believe that this movement could be launched in France and Belgium in the near future. We must put pressure on our governments to prevent them from ratifying the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. An agreement must be reached between the relevant major powers before the German question can be resolved.

French writer Elsa Triolet and lawyer Bruguière spoke in succession. Triolet spoke on behalf of the French National Committee of Writers. She talked about how, during the Nazi occupation of France, the French National Committee of Writers united literary workers with extremely different beliefs to fight the enemy. She called on writers to launch a new resistance movement—a movement to resist war. Bruguière, representing the International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question, expressed support for the resolution of the Congress. He said that the four major powers should immediately begin negotiations with the participation of representatives of the German people. The four major powers and Germany must, within the shortest possible time, prepare to hold general elections by secret ballot to organize an all-German government, so that it can assume the responsibility of concluding a peace treaty. Bruguière finally said that the representatives attending the Berlin conference have agreed to all the resolutions of the World Peace Council on the German question.

The last speaker at the morning session was Kao Sang, the representative from Cambodia, who described the situation of the Cambodian people's national liberation struggle. Kao Sang said that despite the terrorists' and the colonists’ brutal actions, the Cambodian people have established guerrilla bases and liberated areas in fourteen provinces. The democratic government in the liberated areas is extremely concerned about the welfare of the people. Kao Sang said at the end of his speech that although the Cambodian people are waging a fierce war against the US and French imperialists, they are very friendly to the people of the United States and France.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 16th: The World People's Peace Congress continued its session on the evening of the 15th. The meeting was chaired by Soviet representative Korneichuk.

Brazilian representative General Edgard Buchbaum, chairman of the Brazilian National Committee Against the US-Brazil Military Agreement, spoke first. He said that the peace-loving people of Brazil are increasingly feeling the impact of the stepped-up preparations for another world war. The Brazil-US "Military Assistance" Agreement was concluded in March 1952. The war-mongers are using this agreement to force Brazil to participate in the Korean War and, subsequently, in the world war that the United States is preparing, forcing Brazil to accept a colonial system and destroy Brazil's independence.

Buchbaum pointed out that a mass protest movement against the US-Brazil military agreement has been launched throughout Brazil. Even former Brazilian President Artur Bernardes and parliamentarian Cabal opposed the agreement. The senates of many cities, including Rio de Janeiro and Recife, passed resolutions opposing the ratification of the military agreement. Textile workers in the Federal District of Rio de Janeiro held a large demonstration on December 4. The demonstrators demanded that the parliament reject the ratification of the US-Brazil military agreement.

Buchbaum assured the representatives attending the Congress that the Brazilian people will fight to the end against the US attempt to strangle the independence of their motherland.

Next to speak was Tunisian representative Othman Ben Alleya. He spoke about the bloody repression of Tunisian peace advocates by the French colonial authorities. He said that no force can subdue the Tunisian people, and repression cannot thwart their will to struggle. The Tunisian people firmly believe that their struggle for freedom is just.

Ben Alleya said that the Tunisian people hate the reign of terror imposed on them and declare their will to independence. The people of Tunisia know that they can rely on you and that you will join them in demanding that the French government stop this barbaric policy of oppression. His words aroused a storm of applause.

Juan Marinello, the head of the Cuban delegation, described in detail how the US imperialists are gradually dragging Cuba into their aggressive military plans, how they are preventing Cuba from engaging in beneficial trade with democratic countries, and how they are dumping large quantities of US goods on the Cuban market.

Next to speak was Colonel Frederick Manns, the chairman of the International Resistance Movement Participants and Victims of Fascist Rule and Political Prisoners Alliance. He asked, who can better understand the need to strive for peace, and more enthusiastically strive for peace, than those who miraculously escaped death in death camps? Manns emphasized that those who participated in the resistance movement, those who have suffered fascist persecution, and all peace-loving people, demand that the German question be resolved through consultations among the four major powers. Those who have suffered fascist persecution must never allow fascists to threaten their children and wives again.

Heliberto Jara, a winner of the Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace" and a distinguished Mexican peace fighter, spoke next. He said: We hope that the representatives gathered here who are willing to consolidate peace and friendship will make suggestions based on their own beliefs. We hope to find in this way the most correct method of fulfilling our tasks.

He presented suggestions on behalf of the Mexican delegation to promote national independence and international security. Jara finally emphasized that the World People's Peace Congress, which unites people of different faiths, different skin colors, different worldviews, and different political parties, not only proves that peace is the strongest desire of people all over the world, but also points out the path to achieving this desire—the path of solving all problems related to the welfare, peace, and security of the whole world in a spirit of brotherly harmony.

Amende Dailleur spoke on behalf of the French Permanent Council for the Protection of Children. He pointed out that in order to protect children and ensure their healthy development and proper education, it is necessary to solve the issue of lasting peace.

Klora Fassbinder, a professor at the Bonn Institute of Child Education, spoke on the issue of child education.

Mrs. Alaouchi, a member of the Algerian delegation, emphasized that their delegation included representatives from a very broad spectrum of the Algerian people. She described the glorious struggle of the Algerian people for independence, against the ongoing war, and against preparing for another world war. She said that although Algeria is ostensibly considered three provinces of France, it is actually still a French colony. More than 90 percent of its population is illiterate, the national language Arabic is considered a foreign language, and Islam is placed under the "protection" of the colonial authorities. Due to the oppression of the colonial system, the Algerian people are deprived of all human rights and live in extreme poverty. Five hundred thousand Algerians are forced to go to France to earn a living, but they live a miserable life there. The colonial authorities are brutally suppressing the Algerian people's national liberation movement.

Alaouchi finally said that, despite these suppressions, political parties formed a National Front in 1951 to fight for the national independence of Algeria.

The Algerian delegation supports the agenda of the Congress. It will support all resolutions aimed at ensuring the victory of the spirit of negotiation. The Algerian delegation is prepared to establish contact with the French delegation in order to work together for the benefit of peace. The freedom and independence of all nations are necessary conditions for establishing lasting peace.

Speaking at the evening session were also Emilio Sereni, a member of the Italian Senate, Janos Maité, a Hungarian pastor, Inbrahim Rashad, an Egyptian representative, Abdoullah, a Moroccan representative, Aditiyan, an Indian representative, and Laforêt, a French representative.

    世界人民和平大会继续举行
    和平战士纷纷斥责美国侵略罪行
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：世界人民和平大会十五日上午继续举行会议，会议由美国代表乔治·海华德担任主席。布伦姆夫人在会上发表了关于十四日主席团会议的声明。他说：主席团会议已决定按大会议程成立三个委员会，即：民族独立与国际安全问题委员会、结束现行战争问题委员会和缓和国际紧张形势问题委员会。当每一个问题在全体会议讨论完毕时，委员会就开始工作。这些委员会在十五日晚举行第一次会议，以便选出主席。
    在十五日上午会议第一个发言的是寮国代表诺哈·冯沙万。他说：法帝国主义者在美国帮助下进行的侵略战争已继续了七年之久，他们对寮国和平人民犯了史无前例的罪行，进行了野蛮的屠杀。他接着叙述了寮国解放区人民的生活，他着重说明了解放区人民生活水准的提高和文化、经济发展的情形。他最后说：寮国代表曾出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，这样第一次有机会向各国代表说明寮国人民争取和平与自由的情况。
    阿根廷代表诺伯托·弗朗蒂尼在他的发言中揭露了美国的所谓“保卫自由世界”的真正性质。他说：这种虚伪的措施已变成了一种反人类、反和平的战争罪行，朝鲜的悲惨的命运已证明了这一点。他接着举出美国和拉丁美洲国家缔结的双边军事协定为例，指出凡是接受美国军事“援助”的国家，就变成美国的附庸国。他强调保持和平的唯一道路就是和平合作、自由贸易、文化交流、政治制度不同的国家和平共处、争取独立的各国人民获得解放。他最后要求大会努力促使五大国进行谈判，并缔结能为其他国家所接受的和平公约。
    越南代表团团长黎廷探接着发言，他说：越南人民像世界各国人民一样，对世界人民和平大会寄予很大希望。亚洲各国人民已纷纷起来，愈来愈坚决地为争取和平、反对殖民政权和争取民族独立而斗争。他们在这方面已充分的互相了解和支持，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的巨大成功就是一个显著的证据。
    泰国代表团团长乍蕾逢·干拉耶那密在发言中指出：美国正越来越明目张胆地干涉泰国的内政，逐渐把泰国变为军事基地、并使泰国的经济日益从属于美国战略的利益。泰国明年预算中拨供军队和警察用的款项达百分之六十，而公共卫生事业的拨款只占百分之一。朝鲜战争已夺去了许多泰国青年的生命。
    她接着说：泰国政府奉华盛顿之命残酷镇压和平拥护者，许多和平拥护者——包括泰国和平委员会主席在内都已被捕，现在在维也纳的泰国代表团都被警告：如果我们回国，我们也要被拘禁。我们的罪名都只因为拥护世界和平。
    干拉耶那密最后代表泰国代表团要求出席大会的代表尽一切努力立即终止在朝鲜、越南和马来亚的战争。
    接着，意大利代表、议员裘塞佩·尼蒂发言，他谈到在美国支持下的西德重新武装给予欧洲各国人民的威胁。他接着说：和平解决德国问题运动已得到很大的成就，参加这个运动的人愈来愈多。在最近几个月中，我有机会晤见许多具有不同政见的著名领袖，特别是法国和比利时的著名领袖，他们都一致公开反对波恩条约和巴黎条约。尼蒂又谈到议会和平运动，他说：我有理由相信这种运动在最近将来能够在法国和比利时展开。我们必须对我们的政府施用压力，不让它们批准波恩条约和巴黎条约。必须在有关的大国之间取得协议，然后德国问题才能解决。
    法国女作家艾尔莎·特丽奥勒和律师布律吉埃相继发言。特丽奥勒代表法国作家全国委员会发言，她谈到了在希特勒占领法国期间法国作家全国委员会团结法国极不相同的信念的文艺工作者和敌人斗争的情形，她号召现在作家们发动一个新的抵抗运动——抵抗战争的运动。布律吉埃代表国际争取和平解决德国问题会议表示维护大会的决议。他说：四大国应在德国人民代表参加之下立即开始谈判。四大国和德国必须在最短期间内准备举行以不记名投票方式进行的大选，以组织全德政府，使它承担起缔结和约的责任。布律吉埃最后说，出席柏林会议的代表们已同意世界和平理事会关于德国问题的全部决议。
    在上午会议上最后一个发言的是高棉代表高桑，他叙述了高棉人民民族解放斗争的情况。高桑说，尽管殖民者采取了恐怖而残酷的行动，高棉人民已在十四个省份中建立起游击队根据地和解放区，解放区的民主政府极其关心人民群众的幸福。高桑在发言结束时说，虽然高棉人民对美法帝国主义者进行激烈的战争，但他们对美国和法国的人民是非常友善的。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十六日讯：世界人民和平大会十五日晚间继续开会。会议由苏联代表考涅楚克担任主席。
    巴西代表、巴西反对美国—巴西军事协定全国委员会主席埃德加德·布什鲍姆将军首先发言。他说：巴西爱好和平的人民越来越感受到加紧准备另一次世界大战的影响。一九五二年三月缔结了巴西—美国“军事援助”协定，战争贩子们正利用这个协定强使巴西参加朝鲜战争并进而参加美国正在准备的世界战争，强使巴西接受殖民地制度并摧毁巴西的独立。
    布什鲍姆指出：巴西全国掀起了反对美国—巴西军事协定的群众抗议运动。甚至巴西前总统阿土耳·贝尔纳斯、议员卡巴尔等也反对这个协定。里约热内卢、累西腓许多城市的参议院通过了反对批准这个军事协定的决议。里约热内卢联邦区纺织工人在十二月四日举行了大示威。示威者向议会提出了拒绝批准美国—巴西军事协定的要求。
    布什鲍姆向参加大会的代表们保证：巴西人民将为反对美国扼杀他们祖国的独立的企图奋斗到底。
    接着发言的是突尼斯代表欧斯曼·本·阿勒亚。他谈到法国殖民当局对突尼斯和平拥护者所施行的血腥镇压，他说，没有任何力量能使突尼斯人民屈服，镇压挫折不了他们斗争的意志。突尼斯人民坚信，他们争取自由的斗争是正义的。
    本·阿勒亚说，突尼斯人民痛恨强加在他们头上的恐怖统治，他们宣布他们要求独立的意志。突尼斯的人民知道他们可以倚靠你们，知道你们会和他们共同要求法国政府停止这个野蛮的压迫政策。他的话引起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    古巴代表团团长胡安·马里内略详细叙述了美帝国主义者怎样逐渐把古巴拖进他们的侵略性军事计划中去，怎样阻止古巴和民主国家进行有利的贸易，并且在古巴市场上大量倾销美国货物。
    接着发言的是国际抵抗运动参加者及法西斯统治下受害人与政治犯联盟主席弗列德里克·曼斯上校。他问道，有谁能够比那些在死亡营中奇迹似地幸免于死的人们更了解争取和平的需要，更热情地为争取和平而奋斗呢？曼斯强调参加抵抗运动的人们、受过法西斯迫害的人们以及一切爱好和平的人民，都要求通过四大国协商的方式来解决德国问题，受法西斯迫害的人们决不能允许法西斯分子再来威胁他们的孩子和妻子。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、杰出的墨西哥和平战士艾理伯托·哈拉接着发言，他说：我们希望在这里集会的愿意巩固和平和友谊的代表们，从他们自己的信念出发提出建议，我们希望这样找出履行我们的任务的最正确的方法。
    他代表墨西哥代表团提出了促进民族独立和国际安全的建议。哈拉最后强调说，团结了不同信仰、不同肤色、不同世界观和不同党派的人士的世界人民和平大会，不但证明了和平是全世界人民最强烈的愿望，而且也指出了实现这个愿望的道路——以兄弟般和睦的精神解决一切有关全世界福利、和平和安全的问题的道路。
    阿孟德·戴里尔代表法国保卫儿童常设理事会发言。他指出，为了保卫儿童并保证他们的健全的发育和正当的教育，就必须解决持久和平问题。
    波恩儿童教育研究所教授克洛拉·法斯宾德就儿童教育问题发了言。
    阿尔及利亚代表团团员阿拉乌奇区夫人强调说，他们的代表团包括了阿尔及利亚人民中的极广大的阶层的代表。她叙述了阿尔及利亚人民为争取独立、反对目前进行的战争和反对准备另一次世界大战而进行的光荣斗争。她说，虽然阿尔及利亚在表面上被认为是法国的三个省，但它实际上仍旧是法国的一个殖民地。它的人口有百分之九十以上是文盲，民族语文阿拉伯文被认为是外国文，而回教则是置于殖民当局的“保护”之下。由于殖民制度的压迫，阿尔及利亚人民被剥夺了一切人权，过着极端贫困的生活。有五十万阿尔及利亚人被迫赴法国谋生，但是在那里过着悲惨的生活。殖民当局正在残酷地镇压着阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动。
    阿拉乌奇区最后说，纵然有这些镇压，各政治党派在一九五一年结成了民族阵线，为阿尔及利亚的民族独立而斗争。
    阿尔及利亚代表团赞成大会的议程。它将拥护旨在使谈判精神获得胜利的一切决议。阿尔及利亚代表团准备与法国代表团建立联系，以便共同为和平的利益而工作。各国人民的自由和独立，是建立持久和平的必要条件。
    在晚上会议上发言的还有意大利上院议员埃米里奥·塞伦尼、匈牙利牧师雅诺希·麦特、埃及代表英布拉黑姆·拉夏德、摩洛哥代表阿布杜拉、印度代表阿第提安和法国代表拉福雷。
