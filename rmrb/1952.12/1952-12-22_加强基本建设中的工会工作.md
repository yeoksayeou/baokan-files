    Strengthening Trade Union Work in Basic Construction
    Lai Ruoyu

    (I)
    We must realize the great historical task of "national industrialization" at the fastest possible pace, and what determines the speed of industrialization is not the production of existing factories and mines, but the construction of new factories and mines. Therefore, the principle of "basic construction first" is completely correct.
    Does this mean that the production of existing factories and mines is not important? No, the production of existing factories and mines is also very important. Especially when our experience in leading industrial production is still very limited, it is still very important to gain experience in organizing production from existing factories and mines. However, let us repeat once again, basic construction is of primary importance in determining the issue of national industrialization.
    In terms of trade union work, it is an arduous task to both organize the masses of workers to ensure the victorious completion of the national basic construction tasks, and to gain experience in organizing the mass production movement of workers from existing factories and mines, and basic construction is an unfamiliar issue. How should trade unions carry out their work in basic construction? This is a problem that must be solved.

    (II)
    What are the main tasks of trade unions in basic construction?
    First, we must organize the masses of workers to victoriously complete the planned targets of basic construction—engineering progress and quality targets, etc. Then how can we ensure that these targets are achieved?
    (1) We must promote advanced experience. The task of basic construction is extremely arduous, and the existing construction force is far from meeting the objective needs. Therefore, it is particularly important to promote advanced experience in various types of work, improve the technical level of the masses of workers, and increase labor productivity.
    (2) We must strengthen on-site organizational work. Most of the basic construction is large-scale, and many construction sites have adopted parallel operation methods—several projects or several types of work are carried out simultaneously. In this way, chaos can easily occur on the construction site, and this chaos has often occurred in the past. In order to prevent or overcome this chaotic situation on the construction site, we must pay attention to the organizational work on the construction site—scientific management and rational organization and allocation of labor.
    (3) We must pay close attention to the political education of workers. In basic construction, civil engineering and construction workers account for more than 60%. This part of the workers has great mobility and few opportunities for education and training, so they are generally more backward. If we do not strengthen their education, the progress and quality of the project will be affected, and waste will easily occur.
    To do the above three things well, we must grasp a key point, that is, overcome the phenomenon of labor mobility and strive for relative stability of labor. Trade union work must focus on this key point. Especially this winter, we must cooperate with various industrial administrative departments to organize and train the backbone of basic construction. The quality of winter training will have a significant impact on the work on the construction site after the spring.
    The above is the first task of trade union work in basic construction.
    Second, in basic construction, we must ensure that factory safety and health equipment, workers' housing and other welfare facilities are not forgotten. We have had such things happen: a textile factory was built without ventilation equipment, and the machines were arranged very tightly, making it impossible for pregnant female workers to pass through; a new machinery factory started operation, and the wall of the factory building collapsed when a steam hammer struck; a coal mine was built without any toilets at all... When we do not have enough experience in the entire construction work, this point needs special attention. Therefore, trade union workers should participate in engineering design, and even if they do not participate in the design, they should ask and make suggestions to the administrative side.
    Third, organize the production, education and life of construction site workers (construction, hardware, electrical, transportation, etc.). The life of construction site workers is quite hard, and the supply of accommodation, food, entertainment, medicine, and daily necessities is often more difficult than that of factory and mine workers. Appropriately solving their needs in life is very important for improving their production enthusiasm and overcoming the phenomenon of mobility.

    (III)
    Basic construction is related to every industry, so trade union work in basic construction cannot be solely undertaken by the Construction Trade Union. In order to grasp production and strengthen trade union work in basic construction, various industrial trade unions should establish special management agencies or departments for basic construction. Provincial and municipal trade unions with relatively heavy basic construction tasks can establish basic construction committees, and invite responsible comrades from the construction trade union and the basic construction departments of relevant industrial trade unions to participate in the study of problems in basic construction work, summarize work experience, and supervise and urge work in this area. Newly built factories and mines should be sent cadres by the local industrial trade union to which they belong, and it is best to send more to participate in the work. After the factory and mine construction project is completed, some will be transferred to new construction sites, and some will be retained as trade union cadres of the factory and mine. As for the construction site work of ordinary houses (such as office buildings, dormitories, schools, shops, etc.) that do not have labor protection problems or other special problems, it should be the responsibility of the construction trade union.

    ×××
    Strengthening trade union work in basic construction is necessary, and this is not only a current need, but also a long-term need. There are two key points to strengthening this work: one is to grasp the issue of labor organization, especially to grasp the current winter training of construction workers, and strive to fix the basic construction team as much as possible; the other is to establish a special management agency for basic construction.
    Of course, all of this must be carried out under the leadership of the Party. The trade union must frequently and correctly reflect the situation to the Party and make suggestions so that the Party committee can guide the trade union work in a timely manner. This is the most important guarantee for the victorious completion of every basic construction task, and it is also the fundamental principle that the entire trade union work must strictly abide by.

### 加强基本建设中的工会工作

    加强基本建设中的工会工作
    赖若愚
    （一）
    我们必须以尽可能快的步伐实现“国家工业化”这一伟大的历史任务，而决定工业化的速度的不是现有厂矿的生产，而是新的厂矿的建设。所以，“基本建设第一”的方针是完全正确的。
    这是不是说现有厂矿的生产不重要呢？不，现有厂矿的生产也是很重要的。尤其是在我们领导工业生产的经验还很贫乏的时候，从现有厂矿中取得组织生产的经验还是十分重要的。但是，让我们再重复一次，在决定国家工业化的问题上，基本建设是居于首要地位的。
    在工会工作方面，既要组织职工群众，保证国家基本建设任务的胜利完成，又要从现有厂矿中取得组织职工群众生产运动的经验，这是一个艰巨的任务，而基本建设更是一个陌生的问题。在基本建设中工会应该如何进行工作，这是必须解决的一个问题。
    （二）
    在基本建设中，工会的主要任务是些什么呢？
    第一，必须组织职工群众，胜利地完成基本建设的计划指标——工程进度和质量指标等。那么怎样才能保证达到这些指标呢？
    （1）必须推广先进经验。基本建设的任务是极其繁重的，现有的施工力量，远不足以适应客观的需要。因此，推广各类工种的先进经验，提高职工群众的技术水平，提高劳动生产率，就显得特别重要。
    （2）必须加强工地组织工作。绝大部分的基本建设都是规模宏大的，而且很多工地都采取了平行作业的方法——若干工程或若干工种都是同时进行的。这样，工地就很容易发生混乱的情形，这种混乱情形过去也是常常发生的。为了防止或克服这种工地的混乱情形，就必须注意工地的组织工作——科学的管理和劳动力的合理组织与调配。
    （3）必须十分注意职工的政治教育。在基本建设中，土木建筑工人占百分之六十以上。这一部分工人流动性很大，受教育训练的机会不多，所以一般是比较落后的。如果不加强对他们的教育，工程的进度和质量都会受到影响，而且很容易产生浪费现象。
    要把上述三件事情做得好，就必须抓紧一个关键，即克服劳动力的流动现象，争取劳动力的相对固定。工会工作中要紧紧抓住这一关键。特别在今年冬季，要配合各工业行政部门，把基本建设的骨干队伍组织起来，加以训练。冬训工作的好坏，对于开春以后的工地工作是有重大影响的。
    以上是基本建设中工会工作的第一个任务。
    第二，在基本建设中，要保证厂矿安全卫生设备、职工住宅及其他福利设施不被遗忘。我们曾经有过这样的事情：一个纺织厂建设起来了，没有通风设备，机器的排列很挤，使怀孩子的女工走不过去；一个新的机械厂开工了，汽锤一打，震坍了厂房的墙壁；一个煤矿建设起来了，根本没有厕所……。在我们整个建设工作还没有足够经验的时候，这一点是需要特别注意的。所以，工会工作者应当参与工程设计，即使没有参与设计，也应当向行政方面提出询问和建议。
    第三，组织工地工人（建筑、五金、电气、运输等等）的生产、教育及生活。工地工人的生活是相当苦的，住宿、吃饭、娱乐、医药以及日用品的供应等等，常常是比厂矿工人更加困难的。适当地解决他们的生活上的需要，对于提高他们的生产热情和克服流动现象都是很重要的。
    （三）
    基本建设是关涉到每一个产业的，所以基本建设中的工会工作决不是建筑工会所能独力担负起来的。为了抓紧生产而又能加强基本建设中的工会工作，各产业工会应该建立基本建设的专管机构或部门。基本建设任务比较重大的省、市工会，可以建立基本建设委员会，吸收建筑工会和各有关产业工会基本建设部门的负责同志参加，研究基本建设工作中的问题，总结工作经验，并检查督促这一方面的工作。新建的厂矿，应该由当地所属产业工会派遣干部，而且最好多派遣一些去参加工作，将来厂矿建设工程完竣之后，一部分调往新的工地，一部分留作本厂矿的工会干部。至于没有劳动保护问题或其他特殊问题的普通房屋（如机关办公室、宿舍、学校、商店等等）的建筑工地工作，应由建筑工会负责。
    ×××
    加强基本建设中的工会工作，这是必须的，这不但是目前的需要，而且是长期的需要。加强这一工作的关键有二：一是抓紧劳动力的组织问题，特别是抓紧当前建筑工人的冬训工作，尽量求得基本建设队伍的固定化；二是建立基本建设的专管机构。
    当然，所有这些，都必须在党的领导之下来进行。工会必须向党经常地正确地反映情况，提出建议，使党委有可能及时地指导工会工作。这是胜利地完成每一个基本建设任务的最重要的保障，也是整个工会工作必须严格遵守的根本原则。
