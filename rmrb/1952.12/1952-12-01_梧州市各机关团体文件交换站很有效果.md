    The Wuzhou City's Governmental and Organizational Document Exchange Station is Very Effective
    Comrade Editor: Since the People's Daily introduced the experience of the Jilin Provincial People's Government leading Jilin City in establishing a centralized document receiving and dispatching system, the Wuzhou Municipal People's Government of Guangxi, together with the dispatchers and communications staff of major units in the city, studied the matter and drafted measures to establish the "Wuzhou City Governmental and Organizational Document Exchange Station," which began its work in September of this year. Since the establishment of the station, it has proven that this method is indeed worthy of promotion. The Wuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government have each saved one communications staff member. The communications staff of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association both reported: "In the past, sending documents meant I couldn't cook meals. Now, no matter how many documents there are each day, it only takes an hour to send them." Liao Shengrong, a communications staff member of the Municipal People's Government, said: "I used to be afraid of having too many documents, but now I complain that too few documents are sent out each day." Communications staff from other units reported: "I don't have to run all over the city anymore." "The lifespan of my bicycle is longer." "I'm much more free than before, and I can do other things as well." The receiving and dispatching work of each unit has shifted from passive to active, which can play a considerable role in urging those handling affairs. In the beginning, a few smaller units were unwilling to participate because they received and dispatched fewer documents. Some units did not have full-time communications staff, which was of course a problem. Later, a solution was devised: units without full-time communications staff or those with fewer documents received and dispatched would be organized by region, and one person would be sent to the "Exchange Station" in rotation. This solved the problem. The main key to the "Exchange Station" is time, which requires the internal cooperation of each unit, such as distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent matters, handling documents in a planned manner, and not sending "urgent documents" casually. This allows the communications staff to arrive at the station on time or not be too busy due to too many "urgent documents." Now, these are no longer problems. Units that did not participate in the "Exchange Station" originally have already joined one after another.

    梧州市各机关团体文件交换站很有效果
    编辑同志：自从人民日报上介绍吉林省人民政府领导吉林市建立关于文件集中收发的经验后，广西梧州市人民政府即汇同全市较大单位的收发、通信员共同研究，并拟定办法，成立了“梧州市各机关学校团体文件交换站”，于今年九月里开始工作。自该站成立以来，事实证明这个办法的确是可以推广的。中共梧州市委员会和市人民政府，已经各节省通信员一人。市文联、市中苏友好协会的通信员都反映：“以前送了文件，就煮不了饭。现在每天无论文件怎样多，只要一小时就可以送了。”市人民政府通信员廖盛荣说：“以前我一见文件多就害怕，现在我却嫌每天发出的文件太少了。”其他单位的通信员则反映：“不用跑遍全市了。”“单车的寿命也长了。”“这样比以前空得多，可以兼做些别的事情了。”各单位的收发工作，已由被动转为主动，对办事人可以起相当的催促作用。刚开始时，少数较小单位，因为收发的文件少，不愿参加。有的单位没有专职通信员，当然更是问题。后来想出了一个办法：即没有专职通信员的或收发文件较少的单位，按地区联合起来，设法轮流派一人到“交换站”。这样，问题就解决了。“交换站”的主要关键是时间问题，而这就需要各单位内部的配合。如分清急缓、有计划地办好文件，不随便发“急件”等。这可以使通信员按时到站，或不因“急件”太多而忙不过来。现在，这些也没有问题了。原来没有参加“交换站”的单位，都已经纷纷参加了。
