Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 23rd: Soong Ching Ling, head of the Chinese delegation attending the World People's Peace Congress, delivered a speech at the Council meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation on the 20th. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear sisters,

I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in this meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation and to hear the report made by Madame Vaillant-Couturier on behalf of Madame Gotord. I, on behalf of the Chinese women, fully agree with and support the opinions put forward in the report.

We have seen that the Women's International Democratic Federation has constantly called on women of all countries to take active action in the work of striving for the rights of women and children, especially in the movement to defend peace, and has made great contributions. We have also seen that the status and rights of our women have been greatly improved in some countries. I am referring to those countries that have gained democracy and independence and are engaged in peaceful construction. The lives of children in these countries have also been greatly improved, which is something we should be happy about. This also increases our confidence and hope in our work.

But this does not mean that we can be satisfied from now on. On the contrary, our responsibility has never been as great as it is today. At the very moment when we are holding this meeting, countless sisters in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are being brutally murdered, and countless children's bodies are scattered around bomb craters. At the same time, countless sisters in the United States and other countries have lost their husbands and sons, and countless children are homeless and starving. People all over the world are worried about this situation, but if we do not quickly reverse the situation and defend peace, the flames of war will spread and the harm will be expanded. Therefore, our most important task today is to defend peace.

For the sake of the sisters who are fighting heroically in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, for the sake of the sisters who are working diligently in peaceful construction, for the sake of thousands upon thousands of innocent children, for the sake of human culture and a happy life, we should redouble our efforts, we should take concrete actions to call on the sisters all over the world to stand with us. If the women of the whole world rise up to defend peace, then peace will be strongly guaranteed.

I think this is our most urgent task at present, so I propose that the suggestions made by Madame Gotord be taken as concrete steps for us to accomplish this task.

Let us work together!

### 宋庆龄在国际民主妇联理事会上演说

    宋庆龄在国际民主妇联理事会上演说
    【新华社维也纳二十三日电】出席世界人民和平大会的中国代表团团长宋庆龄，在国际民主妇女联合会理事会二十日会议上，发表演说。演说全文如下：亲爱的姐妹们：
    我很高兴能有机会参加国际民主妇女联合会理事会这次会议，并听到瓦扬—古久里夫人代表戈登夫人所作的报告，我代表中国妇女完全同意和拥护报告中提出的意见。
    我们看到国际民主妇联在争取妇女和儿童的权利的工作上，尤其在保卫和平的运动上，曾不断地号召各国妇女采取积极的行动，并且作出了很大的贡献。我们也看到我们妇女的地位和权利在有些国家里已经大大地提高了。我说的是那些获得了民主、独立并从事和平建设的国家，这些国家里儿童的生活也大大改善了，这是值得我们高兴的。这也使我们在工作中增加了信心和希望。
    但是这并不是说我们从此就可以满足了，相反的，我们的责任从来没有像今天这样重大过。就在我们开会的这个时刻，正不知有多少朝鲜、越南和马来亚的姐妹们被残杀了，多少儿童的尸体分散在炸弹坑的周围。同时，也正不知有多少美国和其他一些国家的姐妹们失掉了她们的丈夫和儿子，正不知有多少儿童无衣无食流离失所。全世界人民都正在为这种情况担心，可是如果我们不赶快扭转形势，保卫和平，那么战火将要蔓延起来，祸害将要扩大。因此，今天我们最重要的任务就是保卫和平。
    为了在朝鲜、越南和马来亚等地英勇斗争的姐妹们，为了在和平建设中勤劳工作的姐妹们，为了千千万万个天真无邪的儿童们，为了人类的文化和幸福生活，我们应该加倍地努力，我们应该采取具体的行动，来号召全世界的姐妹们和我们站在一起。如果全世界的妇女都起来保卫和平，那么和平便得到了有力的保证。
    我想这就是我们目前最紧急的任务，因此我提议把戈登夫人提出的意见作为我们完成这个任务的具体步骤。
    让我们共同努力吧！
