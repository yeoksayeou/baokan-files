    Resolutely Implement the Leadership Method of "From the Masses, to the Masses"
    Chen Junsheng, Acting Secretary of the Communist Party of China Fuyu County Committee, Heilongjiang Province
    The experience of Zhaoyuan County in increasing production made me realize that we had great blindness in leading agricultural production in the past, and we turned a blind eye to new things. In recent years, the yields of many high-yield areas in our county have exceeded the highest yields in history. However, we lack the summary of these experiences, especially the promotion, so the potential power in agricultural production has not been fully utilized, and the yield per unit area cannot be greatly improved. We limit our agricultural production to the general leadership of "spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvest, and winter storage," sticking to the old ways and losing the sensitivity of communists to new things. Looking back now, although we have been doing rural work for a long time, we not only lack advanced agricultural scientific knowledge, but also are not very clear about the advanced experiences in past and present agricultural production. This cannot but be said to be a great lesson.
    Why did the above shortcomings occur? The main reason is the lack of a mass viewpoint and a working style of the mass line. This spring, some labor models implemented the cultivation methods of wide sowing, thinning, and replanting in order to effectively complete the production increase plan; many groups calculated the number of crops per ridge and measured the ears of grain, and proposed greater possibilities for increasing production. These groups have now obtained different high yields. For example, the half-hectare of millet in Zhang Wenxiu's group in the first district, due to two thinnings, harvested a total of 4,585 jin, more than three times the yield per unit area last year and more than one and a half times the average yield of the entire village this year. However, we did not discuss and study with the masses at that time to summarize and promote this experience. Experience is created by the masses and exists among the peasant masses, but the leadership did not raise the peasants' production experience to the level of scientific and technological principles, so it could not be transformed into systematic experience, but only used by certain farmers sporadically, and did not form a mass technical reform movement.
    Due to the lack of a strong mass viewpoint, leading cadres do not take the lead in going deep into the masses and into the production process sufficiently. We (especially myself) often lead production from outside the production, relying on general plans and the inherent general experience of leading agricultural production to carry out work. The creativity of the masses is infinite, and new problems are constantly occurring, but the leading cadres do not go deep into the masses and the production process. This not only makes it impossible to consider and decide on work based on new situations, but also makes it impossible to specifically understand and grasp the existing experiences and problems of the masses. Therefore, although we have worked in rural areas for many years and are relatively "familiar" with agricultural production, we cannot constantly absorb new creations of the masses to enrich and improve ourselves. As a result, the phenomenon of "laymen guiding experts" is formed in specific work, and we can only do things in a general way. This cannot but be said to be a damage to the increasingly high enthusiasm of the peasants for increasing production.
    In our actual work, we often emphasize "executing tasks," but we lack investigation and research, and we do not combine actively completing tasks with in-depth investigation and research. As some comrades said: "I mingle with the masses every day and help them with work, but I can't find out the problems." Some comrades said that their work situation is "going up and down, busy in a mess," and "I don't know how to study." This is a problem that we have not thoroughly solved for a long time. Ren Guodong, secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee, has set an example for us, that is, to go deep into the masses, investigate and research, and patiently learn and summarize the experiences of the masses. Zhaoyuan County's production increase experience of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, preserving seedlings, and applying fertilizer in stages" is the result of specifically applying Chairman Mao's working method of "from the masses, to the masses."
    The Fuyu County Party Committee has initially studied how to learn from Zhaoyuan County's experience in high yield and has made a plan to convene a meeting of district committee secretaries and technical extension station cadres to study the method of combining learning from Zhaoyuan County's experience and summarizing the county's own high-yield experience, so as to lead a mass technical reform movement in a planned way. We will use the promotion of Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience and the movement of summarizing the county's specific production increase experience as the beginning for rural work cadres to learn, study, and master agricultural technology, so as to change the working style of rural work leadership that is not deep into the masses, not deep into reality, general, and formalistic. I myself am determined to work together with all rural work comrades in the county to be energetic and work hard on the agricultural production front, conscientiously, go deep, and resolutely raise the leadership of agricultural production a step further to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction.

### 切实贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法

    切实贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法
    中共黑龙江省富裕县委代理书记　陈俊生
    肇源县的增产经验，使我认识到我们过去领导农业生产有很大的盲目性，我们对新鲜事物熟视无睹。我县最近几年来，有不少丰产地的产量超过了历史上最高的产量。但我们对这些经验缺乏总结，尤其缺乏推广，所以农业生产中的潜在力量没有充分发挥出来，不能大大地提高单位面积产量。我们对于农业生产限于“春耕、夏锄、秋收、冬藏”的一般化的领导，故步自封，失掉了共产党员对新鲜事物的敏感。现在回想起来，我们虽长期做农村工作，但是不仅缺乏先进的农业科学知识，就是对于过去和现在农业生产中的先进经验也是不大清楚的。这不能不说是一个极大的教训。
    为什么产生上述的缺点呢？主要原因是缺乏群众观点和群众路线的工作作风。今年春天有些劳动模范为了切实完成增产计划，实行了宽播、间苗、补苗的耕作方法；有许多小组按垄计算了庄稼的棵数，量了穗头，提出了更大的增产的可能性，这些小组现在都得到了不同的高额产量。比如一区张文秀小组的半垧谷子，由于间了两遍苗，共收获四千五百八十五斤，超过去年单位面积产量三倍多，超过今年全村平均产量一倍半。但我们当时没有和群众一起来讨论研究，总结和推广这种经验。经验是群众创造出来的，并存在于农民群众中，但领导方面没有把农民的生产经验提高到科学技术原则，因而不能变成为系统的经验，只是一鳞半爪地为某些农民使用，没有形成群众性的技术改革运动。
    由于群众观点不强，领导干部带头深入群众，深入生产过程是不够的。我们（特别是我自己）往往是站在生产外边来领导生产，凭着一般化的计划和固有的领导农业生产的一般经验来进行工作。群众的创造力是无穷的，新的问题不断在发生着，但领导干部没有深入到群众和生产过程中去，这不但不能根据新的情况来考虑和决定工作，就是连群众中已有的经验和问题也不能具体了解和掌握。因此，我们尽管曾在农村工作多年，对农业生产又比较“熟悉”，但不能经常吸收群众新的创造来充实和提高自己，结果在具体工作上形成“外行指导内行”的现象，只能一般化地照例行事。这对日益高涨的农民增产积极性，不能不说是一种损害。
    我们在实际工作中，常常强调“执行任务”，但缺乏调查研究，没有把积极完成任务和深入调查研究结合起来。正像有的同志说：“我天天和群众打成一片，也帮助群众干活，就是发现不出问题。”有的同志说，他们的工作情况是“上来下去，乱忙一气”，“要钻研不知怎么钻”。这是我们很长时间没有彻底解决的问题。肇源县委书记任国栋同志给我们提出了一个范例，那就是要深入群众，调查研究，耐心地学习和总结群众的经验。肇源县的“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期施肥”的增产经验，就是具体运用毛主席的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的工作方法的结果。
    富裕县委已经初步研究了如何学习肇源县的丰产经验问题，并作出了计划，召开了区委书记和技术推广站的干部会议，研究了结合学习肇源县的经验，总结本县的丰产经验的办法，以便有领导地开展一个群众性的技术改革运动。我们将要通过推广肇源丰产经验，和总结本县具体的增产经验的运动，做为农村工作干部学习、钻研、掌握农业技术的开端，来转变农村工作领导的不深入群众、不深入实际、一般化、形式主义的工作作风。我自己有决心和全县农村工作同志一起振奋起来，在农业生产战线上努力工作，兢兢业业，深入下去，坚决把农业生产的领导提高一步，以适应大规模经济建设的需要。
