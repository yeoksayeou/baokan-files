Korean Central News Agency Publishes Secret American Documents Seized by People's Guerrillas
Exposing New Crimes of American Aggressors Torturing and Killing Korean and Chinese Prisoners of War

[Report from this newspaper] The Korean Central News Agency published some materials on November 28th under the title "Facts Expose the American Butchers," exposing new crimes of the American interventionists in Korea.

The Korean Central News Agency said that one of the most appalling crimes committed by the inhuman murderers from across the ocean was the collective slaughter and torture of Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers in American prisoner of war camps—death camps. The American warlords threatened prisoners of war with death, forcing them to sign declarations refusing repatriation.

The Korean Central News Agency continued, saying that the American butchers treated prisoners of war with utter contempt, yet they shamelessly boasted about their humane treatment of prisoners of war. Now, some secret enemy documents have fallen into the hands of guerrilla fighters operating in a certain area of southern Korea. These secret documents completely expose the lies of the Americans' loudly proclaimed "humane" treatment of prisoners of war. The facts mentioned in these extremely secret documents, which fully expose the American murderers, should be known to everyone. These documents show that another unheard-of horrific crime should be added to the record of bloody crimes committed by the aggressors: using captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as test subjects for various new weapons.

The following are the facts exposed in these documents:

In May 1951, 1,400 prisoners of war were secretly transported to the United States as test subjects for atomic weapons. The lists of these prisoners of war have been destroyed. On July 15, 1951, one hundred prisoners of war in Prisoner of War Camp No. 62 were machine-gunned, as stated in the document, "for the purpose of training machine gunners to shoot at moving targets." On February 18, 1952, another three hundred prisoners of war in the same prisoner of war camp were machine-gunned in the same manner. On March 13, April 17, and April 20, a total of 170 prisoners of war were shot.

These documents confirm that on May 10, 1952, four prisoners of war in Prisoner of War Camp No. 76 were hanged after expressing their willingness to return to their country. On May 1, the American butchers gouged out the eyes of eighteen prisoners of war. On May 18, thirteen soldiers of the Korean People's Army were dismembered in the prisoner of war camp. When the other prisoners of war in this camp protested, the guard officer took away fifty people and used them as test subjects for new types of grenades on the same day. Four prisoners of war were killed on the spot, and the remaining forty-six became disabled and soon died of their injuries.

On May 27, 1952, the aggressors committed extremely brutal acts in Prisoner of War Camp No. 77. The document states that a large number of prisoners of war who demanded repatriation were used here as test subjects for a new type of flame thrower. Eight hundred prisoners of war were burned alive on that day. In the same prisoner of war camp, a total of thirty-seven people were killed and sixteen were injured on May 20 and 30.

The American aggressors must be held accountable for these facts before all of humanity. The Korean Central News Agency wrote in conclusion that the people of the world should rise up and sever the blood-stained hands of the American butchers and murderers.

    朝鲜中央通讯社公布人民游击队缴获的美国秘密文件
    暴露美国侵略者虐杀朝中战俘的新罪行
    【本报讯】朝鲜中央通讯社十一月二十八日以“事实揭露了美国刽子手”为题，公布了一些材料，揭发美国干涉者在朝鲜的新的罪行。
    朝鲜中央通讯社说，来自大洋彼岸的失去了人性的凶手所干的最骇人听闻的罪行之一，就是在美国俘虏营——死亡营中对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士，施以集体屠杀和拷打。美国军阀以死亡相威胁，强迫战俘在拒绝回家的宣言上签名。
    朝鲜中央通讯社继续说，美国刽子手卑贱地虐待战俘，但他们还无耻地侈谈其对待战俘的人道态度。现在，敌人的一些秘密文件已经落到在朝鲜南部某地区活动的游击队战士的手中。这些秘密文件使得美国大肆叫嚷的以“人道”态度对待战俘的谎言完全揭穿了。在这些极端秘密的以及由此而全盘供出美国凶手的文件中所谈到的事实，应当为大家所知道。这些文件说明，在侵略者所干下的那些血腥的罪恶的纪录上，还应当加上一桩闻所未闻的恐怖罪行——把朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员当作各种新式武器的试验品。
    下面就是这些文件所暴露的事实：
    一九五一年五月，有一千四百名战俘被秘密地运往美国作为原子武器的试验品。这些战俘的名单已被销毁。一九五一年七月十五日，六十二号俘虏营中有一百名战俘被机关枪枪杀，正如文件中所说，“其目的是为了训练机关枪手射击活动目标。”一九五二年二月十八日，在同一俘虏营中，又有三百名战俘为同样方法所枪杀。在三月十三日，四月十七日和二十日，总共有一百七十名战俘被枪杀。
    这些文件证实，在一九五二年五月十日，七十六号俘虏营的四名战俘表示他们愿意回国后就被绞死。五月一日，美国刽子手们把十八个战俘的眼睛挖出来。五月十八日，十三名朝鲜人民军的战士在俘虏营中被肢解。当这个俘虏营的其他战俘表示抗议的时候，守卫的军官带走了五十个人，就在当天，把他们当作新式手榴弹的试验品。四名战俘当场被炸死，其余四十六名成了残废，不久就因伤重而死去。
    一九五二年五月二十七日，侵略者在七十七号俘虏营内干下了极为残暴的行为。文件中说，在这里，大批要求遣送回家的战俘被用来作为一种新型火焰放射器的试验品。这一天有八百名战俘被活活地烧死了。在同一俘虏营中，五月二十日和三十日共计有三十七人被杀，十六人受伤。
    美国侵略者必须在全人类面前对这些事实负责。朝鲜中央通讯社在结语中写道，全世界人民都应当起来，斩断美国刽子手和杀人犯那只染满鲜血的手。
