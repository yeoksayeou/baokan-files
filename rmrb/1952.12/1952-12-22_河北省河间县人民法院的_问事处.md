The Hejian County People's Court in Hebei Province established an "Inquiry Office" in 1950 to receive the people and handle some simple cases, which has been very effective. The cases resolved by the Inquiry Office account for nearly one-third of all civil cases handled by the court, so it is practically equivalent to a "street-level court."

The "Inquiry Office" is located at the entrance of the court. People can enter without a guard or needing a formal written complaint. When the masses arrive, they are simply registered. Those who come to inquire are given answers on the spot. If the plaintiff and defendant come together, the court takes a record of both parties' statements and mediates on the spot. If mediation is difficult or unsuccessful, the case is accepted and processed further. If only one party comes, the date for both parties to come together is scheduled after registration, and the other party is notified by the court. If the other party does not come after notification, or if a judgment is difficult to enforce, the case is accepted and processed further. For some simple cases where one party is absent, the Inquiry Office, with the consent of the plaintiff, refers the case back to the original district, township, or village for mediation. For some cases that are not resolved through mediation by the Inquiry Office or mediation back in the original location, but the facts of the case are clear, the case is no longer transferred to the civil or criminal court for a retrial. Instead, the court's administrative meeting discusses and judges the case, writes a brief judgment, and delivers it to the Inquiry Office to announce or send to the parties concerned.

When there is a market day in the county seat, the Inquiry Office extends its working hours or increases staff when there are many people inquiring. Therefore, general matters are handled in a timely manner. On the walls of the Inquiry Office, there are illustrated explanations of various laws and some representative precedents, which people who come to the Inquiry Office can read at will. Many people coming to the market even come to the Inquiry Office to take a look or sit and listen to the mediation of cases, even if they have no business there. In this situation, the mediator conducts publicity and education on relevant laws and policies based on the content of the case. For example, when a party still insists on an error after repeated persuasion and education during the mediation of a case, the audience is mobilized to participate and express their opinions, forming a mass criticism of the wrongdoer, so that the case can be successfully concluded. The Inquiry Office also maintains contact with relevant departments at any time. For example, in divorce cases, when the woman's thinking is not clear, the County Women's Federation is asked to assist in the resolution. In the case of military family issues, the Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government is asked to assist when necessary.

Such a "street-level court" – the Inquiry Office – reduces many unnecessary procedures for the court, provides convenience to the masses, and strengthens the relationship between the masses and the court. The masses reflect: "Now the problem is solved as soon as you enter the door."

    河北省河间县人民法院的“问事处”
    陈希  王锡古
    河北省河间县人民法院从一九五○年起，设立了一个接待人民和处理一些简单案件的“问事处”，收效很大。问事处所解决的案件几占该院全部民事案件的三分之一，所以它实际上已经等于一个“临街法庭”。
    “问事处”设在法院门口，既无门岗，也不需要状子就可以进去。群众来时，登记一下即可。问事的，当场给予解答。原告和被告一同来的，笔录双方口供后，当场调解；若难于调解或调解不好，即作为收案，再作处理。如当事人只来了一方，登记后即预订下次双方同来的日期，并由法院通知另一方；如果另一方经通知而不来，或易判决难执行的，即作为收案，再作处理。某些案件情况简单，但当事人有一方没来，问事处取得起诉人同意，便介绍回原区、乡、村调解。某些案件，经问事处调解或回原地调解不成，但案情已大白，也不再转民庭或刑庭从头审讯，只由法院的院务会议讨论判决后写成简明的判决书，交问事处向当事人宣判或送给当事人即可。
    逢县城赶集，问事人多时，即延长问事处的工作时间，或增加工作人员。所以，一般的事件都是及时处理了的。在问事处的墙壁上，挂有关于各种法令的图解和一些有代表性的判例，来问事处的人们可以随意阅览。有不少赶集的群众，即使没事情，也会到问事处来看看，或坐着听听案件的调解。在这种情况下，调解员即随时依据案件内容，进行有关法令、政策的宣传教育。如在调解案件时，当事人经过一再说服教育而仍然坚持错误，即发动旁听群众参加意见，形成群众性的对错误者的批判，使案件顺利结束。问事处还随时和有关部门联系：如在离婚案中，女方思想不通时，即请县民主妇联协助解决；又如军属问题，必要时即请县人民政府民政科协助解决。
    这样的“临街法庭”——问事处，减少了法院的不少不必要的手续，给群众以便利，密切了群众与法院的关系。群众反映：“现在一进门就解决问题了。”
