Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The trade among socialist camp countries is increasingly developing, and the trade of the new democratic world market is gradually expanding.

The trade volume among socialist camp countries increased more than threefold from 1948 to 1952. The Soviet Union plays a major role in this, with the Soviet Union's supply of the latest machinery and equipment to the people's democratic countries increasing ninefold alone. In trade, the Soviet Union not only provides these machines and complete equipment for large metallurgical, chemical, textile, and other factories, but also provides industrial raw materials and other items needed by various countries. Other countries, such as China, provide raw materials and grain; Poland provides coal, non-ferrous metals and ferrous metals, and machinery; Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic provide equipment and machinery; Hungary provides transportation equipment, electrical equipment, bauxite, textiles, and agricultural products; Romania provides petroleum and petroleum products, wood, and grain; Bulgaria provides industrial crop products, fruits, and minerals; and Albania provides oil, asphalt, and agricultural products. That is to say, in this friendly family, each country obtains items that are extremely important to its national economy according to its own needs and the possibilities of supply from other countries, and also supplies other countries according to the needs of other countries and its own ability to supply. This situation has been further developed due to the many long-term trade agreements implemented among countries starting in 1952. According to these agreements, countries have planned to produce and supply goods for other countries and to obtain supplies from other countries in a planned manner. For example, in recent months, in order to avoid frequent adjustments to rolled metal factories so that factory equipment can fully exert its power, several countries have signed agreements on rolled metal. These agreements stipulate that rolled metals of different thicknesses should be produced and exchanged by different countries through division of labor. In the future, trade between countries will greatly increase. Taking the trade between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe as an example, from 1951 to 1955, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia will increase by 50 percent annually compared to the average from 1948 to 1950. From 1952 to 1955, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Romania will increase by 50 percent annually compared to the average from 1948 to 1951. From 1951 to 1958, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Poland will increase by 60 percent annually compared to the average from 1948 to 1950.

    社会主义阵营各国贸易日益发展
    【新华社二十三日讯】社会主义阵营各国的贸易日益发展，新的民主世界市场的贸易正在逐渐扩大。
    社会主义阵营各国间的贸易额从一九四八年到一九五二年增加了两倍多。苏联在这中间起着主要作用，苏联单是供给各人民民主国家的最新式机器和设备一项就增加了九倍。在贸易中苏联不仅提供这些机器和庞大的冶金、化学、纺织及其他工厂的完美设备，还提供工业原料以及各国所需的其他物品。其他国家，如中国就提供原料和粮食，波兰提供煤、有色金属和黑色金属、机器，捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国提供设备和机器，匈牙利提供运输装备、电气设备、铁矾土、纺织品和农业产品，罗马尼亚提供石油和石油产品、木材和粮食，保加利亚提供工业作物产品、水果和矿产，阿尔巴尼亚提供石油、沥青和农产品。这就是说，在这友好的大家庭中，各个国家都按照自己的需要和别国供应的可能取得对本国国民经济极其重要的物品，同时也按照别国的需要和自己供应的能力供应别国。这种情况已因各国间在一九五二年开始实行的许多长期贸易协定而更加发展。各国已按照这些协定有计划地为着别国生产和供应货物和有计划地取得别国的供应。例如近数月来，为了避免经常调整压延金属工厂而使工厂设备能够充分发挥力量，若干国家签订了关于压延金属的协定。这些协定规定把不同厚度的压延金属由各国分工生产而互相交换。今后各国的贸易将大大增加。仅以苏联和东欧人民民主国家的贸易为例，一九五一年到一九五五年，苏联对捷克斯洛伐克的贸易额要比一九四八到一九五○年平均每年增加百分之五十。一九五二年到一九五五年，苏联对罗马尼亚的贸易额要比一九四八到一九五一年平均每年增加百分之五十。一九五一到一九五八年，苏联对波兰的贸易额要比一九四八到一九五○年平均每年增加百分之六十。
