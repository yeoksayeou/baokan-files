    Nanchang Post Office Changes Working Methods
    To Enable Readers to See Out-of-Town Newspapers Earlier
    Comrade Editor: Li Baoyuan, a comrade from the Nanchang Post Office Distribution Section, put forward a rationalization proposal based on actual needs. The post office leadership adjusted working hours, enabling readers to see newspapers from other places one day earlier. Originally, the "People's Daily," "Changjiang Daily," and "Liberation Daily" were delivered to the Nanchang Post Office at 9:00 PM. At this time, the staff of the Nanchang Post Office were off work, so they had to wait until the next day to go to work before the distributors could unseal and distribute them. However, the postmen going to the countryside set off before going to work every morning. Therefore, these newspapers had to wait until the third morning to be delivered. In order to allow readers to see the newspapers one day earlier, Comrade Li Baoyuan suggested that the working hours of the distributors of newspapers from other places be transferred from one or two o'clock in the daytime to after ten o'clock in the evening. In this way, as soon as the newspapers arrive, they can be unsealed and distributed immediately, and the postmen going to the countryside can deliver them the next morning. The Nanchang Post Office leadership adopted his rationalization proposal. Since then, readers within the delivery range of the Nanchang Post Office have been able to see the "People's Daily" and newspapers from major administrative regions one day earlier. Cao Songnian

    南昌邮局改变工作方法
    使读者提早看到外埠报纸
    编辑同志：南昌邮局发行股李宝元同志因为按照实际需要，提出了合理化建议，邮局领导方面调整了工作时间，使读者能提早一天看到外地报纸。本来，“人民日报”、“长江日报”、“解放日报”运到南昌邮局已是晚上九点钟了。这时候，南昌邮局工作人员都下了班，只好等到次日上班后再由发行员拆封、分发出去。但下乡的邮递员是在每日早晨上班前就出发了。因此这些报纸一直要等到第三天早晨才能送出去。李宝元同志为了让读者早一天看到报纸，建议把外埠报纸发行员的工作时间，从白天抽调一两点钟到晚上十点钟以后去工作。这样，报纸一到，就立即拆封、分发，第二天早晨，下乡的邮递员就能送出去。南昌邮局领导方面采纳了他这个合理化建议，从此南昌邮局邮递范围内的读者都能提前一天看到“人民日报”和各大行政区的报纸了。曹松年
