Minister of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, Fu Zuoyi, delivered a report on the farmland water conservancy work in the 1952 drought prevention and resistance movement at the 163rd meeting of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 19. The abstract of the report is as follows:

This year, the achievements of farmland water conservancy construction across the country have been more significant than in previous years, and mass water conservancy construction has made particularly prominent progress. As of now, a total of 187,000 canals have been built and renovated nationwide, along with 2.08 million projects such as ponds, dams, culverts, and sluice gates. Over 753,000 new brick, stone, and earth wells have been dug, 167,000 waterwheels have been loaned out, and more than 3,500 horsepower of water pumps have been added. This can expand the irrigated area by more than 32.4 million mu, exceeding the total increase in irrigated area in 1950 and 1951 by more than 10 million mu. Among them, the actual benefited area this year is about 24 million mu. According to incomplete statistics, the area of irrigated land in the country is now about 80 million mu, and the area of paddy fields is over 370 million mu, totaling over 450 million mu, accounting for about 30 percent of the total cultivated land area in the country.

The reasons for the significant achievements this year are mainly that the Government Administration Council promptly issued a decision on launching a mass drought prevention and resistance movement at the beginning of the year. Governments at all levels organized production and drought prevention offices, which, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, clearly regarded farmland water conservancy work as the central task for a certain period, concentrated efforts, mobilized the masses, and closely integrated water conservancy construction with the surging patriotic production increase movement, giving full play to the potential power of the masses. In North China, Northwest China, and Southwest China, drought prevention work was prepared last winter, so cadres and the masses were mobilized to join the movement very quickly. In North China, tens of thousands of cadres in Shanxi and Hebei participated in the fight against drought one after another. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the labor force used in the drought prevention movement reached more than 67 million people, and a total of more than 230 million cubic meters of earthwork was done in conjunction with Shandong and southern Anhui. In the southwest, northern Sichuan and eastern Sichuan also had 5 to 6 million people participating in watering and carrying water, and vigorously developing water sources. The northern counties of Hubei Province, which were severely affected by drought, mobilized half of the population and tens of thousands of waterwheels to continuously pump water to fight the drought for as long as two months. Although the severity of the drought was unprecedented in many years, more than 10 million mu were rescued and reduced losses. In the movement, all localities also paid special attention to mutual assistance and cooperation among the masses. For example, of the 110,000 waterwheels loaned out in North China this year, 70 percent were jointly borrowed by farmers. Many villages are organized to dig wells and install waterwheels in a planned way. Old waterwheels and wells were also reasonably priced by the whole village, and neighbors were organized to use and repair them together and take turns irrigating the land. This not only consolidated and promoted the mutual assistance organizations of the masses, but also greatly exerted the effectiveness of water conservancy. For example, in Lixian County, Hebei Province, one waterwheel well can irrigate 150 mu of land.

However, drought disasters still occurred in four special districts in Hubei, a dozen counties in Henan, and parts of Hebei, Shandong, and Pingyuan, affecting approximately 22 million mu. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop farmland water conservancy as a planned, long-term, and important construction undertaking.

In the south, concentrating efforts, deepening and expanding ponds and weirs to increase water storage, strengthening management and maintenance organizations, and extensively building small reservoirs, water ponds, dams, and weirs, and developing and improving water lifting tools are the most effective measures. In the north, we should vigorously develop all water sources, lead the masses in a planned way to dig canals and wells, and in areas with suitable conditions, we can extensively build ponds and small reservoirs, and we must pay special attention to giving full play to the irrigation effectiveness of existing water conservancy facilities. At present, each waterwheel well irrigates an average of less than 20 mu of land. If, after planning, organization, cone well sinking and other work, it reaches 40 mu of irrigation land, then the existing 720,000 waterwheels can increase the irrigated area by about 20 million mu, and can save more than 1.5 trillion yuan in waterwheel investment. In the irrigation of canals, attention should be paid to strengthening management, which can also expand the irrigated area by a lot.

In terms of large-scale new-style irrigation projects with more than 10,000 mu, a total of 107 projects were undertaken in various places this year, with a planned benefited area of 7.92 million mu. Some of these projects were completed in the second half of this year, and some were started in the second half of this year, so most of them will not be able to exert irrigation effectiveness within the year. In the future, it is necessary to gradually increase strength and build large-scale irrigation systems in a planned way to solve the drought problem within a certain range. The main shortcomings that currently exist in large-scale irrigation projects are: (1) Lack of comprehensive planning. Many areas lack sufficient analysis of the amount of water available, so that after the project is completed, there is insufficient water or the water use of existing irrigation canals is affected. (2) Many areas only focus on doing new projects and neglect the rectification and irrigation management of completed projects. In addition, due to excessive water use habits of farmers and poor management, soil salinization has occurred in many irrigated areas. For example, cotton fields in the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi Province have generally reduced production. In addition to not implementing crop rotation, poor irrigation may be the main reason (it is currently being studied). Therefore, how to effectively implement the scientific water use system recommended by Soviet experts in the future to prevent soil salinization caused by poor irrigation is an important issue that all irrigated areas should pay attention to solving. (3) In many areas, the engineering design is not thorough, and the basic construction procedures are violated, resulting in poor engineering quality or waste.

In order to further improve the farmland water conservancy work, the following four suggestions are put forward: First, a nationwide mass drought prevention and resistance movement should be continued in 1953. The production and drought prevention office is a powerful organizational form with unified steps, organic coordination, centralized leadership, and mobilization of the broad masses. In the future, its leading role should be maintained and strengthened. Second, the farmland water conservancy undertaking is a long-term and important economic construction, and the policy is to attach equal importance to building new irrigation projects and giving full play to the effectiveness of existing water conservancy facilities. In order to strengthen the leadership of mass water conservancy and the management of completed projects, the provincial-level departments will mainly be responsible for promoting it in the future, and the construction of large-scale irrigation projects will be planned and controlled by the central government as a whole, and the provinces will cooperate, but the strength of the provinces will not be dispersed. Third, the old irrigation areas and the newly completed irrigation areas should establish the policy of enterprise management, implement the economic accounting system, and pay attention to giving full play to the engineering benefits. Fourth, the water conservancy business organizations at the provincial, special, and county levels in areas with heavy tasks should be replenished.

    中央水利部傅作义部长关于一九五二年防旱抗旱运动中的农田水利工作报告（摘要）
    中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长，于十二月十九日，在中央人民政府政务院第一百六十三次会议上作了关于一九五二年防旱抗旱运动中的农田水利工作的报告。报告摘要如下：
    今年全国各地农田水利建设的成效都较往年显著，群众性的水利建设更有突出的进展。截至目前为止，全国共已兴修、整修渠道十八万七千道，塘、坝、涵、闸等工程二百零八万处，新打的砖、石、土井七十五万三千余眼，贷出水车十六万七千辆，添置抽水机三千五百多马力，共可扩大灌溉面积三千二百四十余万亩，超过一九五○、一九五一年两年增加灌溉面积总和一千余万亩。其中今年实际受益面积约为二千四百万亩。根据不完全的统计，现在全国水浇地的面积约计八千余万亩，水田面积三亿七千余万亩，两项总计四亿五千余万亩，约占全国总耕地面积百分之三十。
    今年获得显著成绩的原因，主要是年初政务院及时地发布了关于开展群众性防旱抗旱运动的决定，各级政府组织了生产防旱办公室，在各级党委和政府领导下，明确地把农田水利工作当做一定时期的中心任务，集中力量，发动群众，使兴修水利与高涨的爱国增产运动密切地结合起来，充分发挥了群众的潜在力量。华北、西北、西南各区防旱工作因去冬即有准备，因而动员干部群众投入运动非常迅速，华北的山西、河北先后参加抗旱斗争的干部都有十数万人，江苏、浙江在防旱运动中用工达到六千七百余万人，连山东、皖南共做了土方二亿三千余万方。西南的川北、川东也各有五、六百万群众参加车水、担水，并大力开发水源的工作。旱情严重的湖北省北部县份，动员了半数人口和上万架水车，连续车水抗旱达两月之久。虽旱情严重程度为若干年来所未有，但经抢救后有一千余万亩减免了损失。在运动中，各地也特别注意到群众的互助合作。像华北今年贷出的十一万辆水车，百分之七十是农民合伙贷的。不少村庄，都是组织起来有计划地打井安水车。旧有的水车井，也有的全村进行了合理作价，组织地邻公用公修，轮流浇地，这不仅巩固和促进了群众的互助组织，而且也大大发挥了水利效能，如河北省蠡县就有的一眼水车井能浇一百五十亩地。
    但是，今年发生旱灾的，还有湖北四个专区，河南十数个县及河北、山东、平原等一部分地区，大约有二二○○万亩。因此，将发展农田水利作为有计划的长期的重要建设事业之一，是十分必要的。
    在南方，集中力量，加深扩大塘堰以增加蓄水量，加强管理养护组织和广泛兴建小型水库，水塘坝堰，发展与改善提水工具是最有效的措施。在北方，应大力开发一切水源，有计划地领导群众开渠打井，有条件地区并可广泛兴建池塘、小水库，并须特别注意发挥现有水利的灌溉效能。现在一眼水车井平均浇不到二十亩地，若经过计划、组织、锥井下泉等工作，达到浇地四十亩时，则现有的七十二万辆水车，就可增加灌溉面积二千万亩左右，并可以节省水车投资一万五千亿元以上。在渠道的灌溉上，注意加强管理，也可扩大灌溉面积很多。
    在万亩以上的大型新式灌溉工程方面，今年各地共作了一○七处，计划受益面积七九二万亩。这些工程，有的是今年后半年完工的，有的是后半年才开工的，所以多数在年内还不能发挥灌溉效能。今后需要逐步地增加力量，有计划地修筑大型灌溉系统，以解决一定范围内的干旱问题。现在在大型灌溉工程中存在的主要缺点是：（1）缺乏全面的规划。不少地区对水源多寡缺乏足够的分析，以致工程完成后发生水量不足或影响已有灌溉渠道的用水。（2）不少地区只顾做新的工程，轻视既成工程的整顿和灌溉管理。此外，由于农民习惯用水过多，管理不善，许多灌区已发生土地碱化现象。如陕西泾惠渠，棉田普遍减产，除了没有实行作物轮作外，灌溉不良可能是主要原因（现正在研究）。因此，今后如何切实实行苏联专家所建议的科学用水制度，防止因灌溉不良促使土壤碱化，是所有灌区极应注意解决的一个重要问题。（3）不少地区在工程上设计不周，违犯基本建设程序，致工程质量不佳，或发生浪费的现象。
    为了进一步做好农田水利工作，特提出下列四点意见：一、在一九五三年应继续开展全国性的群众防旱抗旱运动。生产防旱办公室是一个统一步调有机配合，集中领导，组织动员广大群众的有力组织形式，今后仍应继续保持并加强其领导作用。二、农田水利事业是长期的重要的经济建设之一，方针是兴办新的灌溉工程和发挥现有的水利设施的效能同时并重。为了加强群众性水利及既成工程的管理工作的领导，今后主要由省级部门负责推进，大型灌溉工程的建设则由中央统筹规划掌握，由省配合，但不分散省的力量。三、对于旧有灌区及新近完成的灌区应确立企业经营的方针，实行经济核算制度，注意工程效益的充分发挥。四、任务繁重地区的省、专、县各级水利业务机构，应予充实。
