Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: As the New Year approaches, recent reports from American news agencies reflect that the morale of the U.S. troops and accomplice countries' soldiers invading Korea is low, and they are worried and fearful as they look back on the past and forward to the future.

    A dispatch from the United Press International on the 27th stated: "Some American infantrymen and United Nations soldiers from the front lines are spending a day of leave in this war-torn South Korean capital today. Holding a cup of hot coffee in their hands, they are thinking about how 'futile' the war in Korea has been in 1952. In the fast-food restaurants of the post exchanges, amid the sounds of Christmas carols, soldiers from five countries are sitting and talking, sometimes about their friends and families, and sometimes quietly contemplating what might happen to them in 1953." Private O'Neill sadly said, "I don't think this New Year will be good for us." Another Private Hudson emphasized, "Don't expect to have a happy New Year here." An Australian soldier said, "As far as my soldiers are concerned, they would rather go home than stay here." A Marine soldier said that if the war continues like this, it is "just a waste of personnel, resources, and time." Canadian soldier Russell spoke listlessly about the harsh winter! He said, "The soldiers' morale is very low, and they can't get excited."

    United Press International, in reporting on the morale of American soldiers at the front before Christmas, reflected that these soldiers' estimates of the future were even more pessimistic. The report said: "This war may last for fifty years, and there is no guarantee that the United States will win. This is the pessimistic estimate made by some warriors today." This estimate "has begun to make thousands of American soldiers feel uneasy." Along the "frozen, white Korean front line, soldiers are huddled together in bunkers, waiting for the word they have been waiting for a long time, which is 'rotation'."

    Another United Press International dispatch quoted five American soldiers talking on Christmas Day. Soldier De Guero said: While preparing for battle on Christmas morning, "What I hope for is to go back alive. I hope this group of people can go back alive, I am very scared." Sergeant Hennessey said, "We talk about home, and we don't know if we can spend another Christmas."
    He said, "I was very unhappy this Christmas morning. I am worried about myself, and also about the new brothers who are going on patrol with us. They are very scared, and I don't blame them." Squad leader Staff Sergeant Hagood recalled how he spent Christmas with his family at home last year. He said: "I curse the war, I curse the cold here… I seem to be in two places at once. My body is here, but my heart is at home."

    Corporal Needham was most concerned about his fiancée Mary and his family. He said: "After a while, the firing started, and we quickly left there. This day was really difficult. It is very important to stay alive."

    After quoting these conversations, the report said: "Those American soldiers all nodded in agreement: It is very important to stay alive."

### 新年前夕侵朝美军士气消沉

    新年前夕侵朝美军士气消沉
    【新华社二十九日讯】新年快到了，据美国通讯社最近的消息反映：士气低沉的侵朝美军和帮凶国军队的士兵在回顾过去、瞻望未来的时候，都担心害怕。
    美国国际新闻社二十七日的消息中说：“从前线部队来的一些美国步兵和联合国士兵，今天在这个饱受战争摧残的韩国首都度一天的假期，他们手里端着一杯热咖啡，心里在想一九五二年这一年中在朝鲜进行的战争是怎样地‘徒劳无功’。在随军商店的快餐馆里，在圣诞颂歌声中，五个国家的士兵坐着谈天，他们有时谈到他们的朋友和家庭的事情，有时静静地思索他们在一九五三年中可能有怎样的遭遇。”一等兵奥奈尔悲哀地说：“我认为这个新年对我们来说是不会好过的。”另一个一等兵郝德森强调说：“你休想在这里过一个快乐的新年”。一位澳大利亚军人说：“拿我的士兵来说，他们宁愿回家，不愿呆在这里”。一位海军陆战队的士兵说：战争像现在这样打下去，“只是白白浪费人员、物资和时间罢了”。加拿大士兵拉塞尔没精打彩地谈到严酷的冬天！他说：“士兵们士气很低，提不起劲来”。
    国际新闻社在报道圣诞节日前线美国兵的士气时，反映出这些士兵对前途的估计是更加悲观。消息说：“这场战争也许会打五十年，而且还不能保证美国一定得胜。这是一些战士们今天所作的悲观估计。”这种估计，“已开始使成千的美国士兵感到不安”。沿着“结冰的白茫茫的朝鲜战线，士兵们在地堡中挤作一团，等待他们很久以来一直等待着的一句话，那就是‘轮换’。”
    国际新闻社的另一条消息引述了五个美国兵在圣诞节的谈话。士兵德·盖罗说：在圣诞节早晨准备作战的时候，“我所希望的就是活命回去。我希望这一伙人都能活命回去，我很害怕。”中士汉尼西说：“我们谈起家乡，不知道我们还能不能过下一个圣诞节。”
    他说：“在这个圣诞节的早晨，我很不高兴。我为我自己担心，也为那些和我们一道去巡逻的新来的弟兄们担心。他们害怕得很，我并不怪他们。”班长哈古德上士想起去年在家里与家人们共度圣诞节的情形。他说：“我咀咒战争，我咀咒这里的寒冷。……我好像心挂两地。身在这里，心在家里。”
    下士尼德罕姆所最挂念的是他的未婚妻玛丽和家人们。他说：“过了一会开起火来，我们赶快离开那里。这一天可真难过。活着是非常重要的。”
    消息在引述了这些谈话后说：“那些美国兵都点头同意：活着是非常重要的。”
