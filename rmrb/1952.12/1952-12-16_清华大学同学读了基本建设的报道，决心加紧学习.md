    Tsinghua University Students Determined to Study Harder After Reading Reports on Basic Construction
    Editor: Tsinghua University students are generally very excited that the newspaper has placed the promotion of basic construction in a primary position. A student from the Department of Electrical Engineering said, "In the past, it was always about recovery, recovery. Today, basic construction has been elevated to a primary position, and the newspaper has been publishing news about it for several days in a row." Students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering said: The Party and the government have found ways to mobilize cadres from all aspects to participate in basic construction, and they are all the most outstanding cadres, which shows that the government attaches great importance to basic construction. The news of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction has further encouraged the students. First-year students from the Iron and Steel Institute said: Incredible, truly great. Some said, "The motherland's large-scale construction has really begun," "The construction of Anshan Iron and Steel is indeed large-scale; even a foundation bolt weighs 1.8 tons," "In the past, the Jingjiang flood diversion and Huai River control were just earthwork projects, and they were done by manual labor. Today, the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel is mechanized, and the technology of engineering construction is improving day by day."
    
    Due to the newspaper's publicity about basic construction, many students feel the importance of their responsibilities and must study hard. Some students said after reading the editorial: "It is very clear: there are many tasks and few cadres. I deeply feel the importance of my responsibility." Some students said: "The motherland's construction is developing so rapidly, and if we don't study hard, we will fall behind." In particular, the third-year students, after hearing the graduated students say that the drawings they made were considered too old by Soviet experts and were unacceptable, felt that they were about to take on construction posts and needed to study harder.

    清华大学同学读了基本建设的报道，决心加紧学习
    编辑同志：清华大学同学对报纸把基本建设宣传提到首要地位，普遍感到很兴奋。电机系某同学说：“过去老是恢复、恢复，今天把基本建设提到首要地位来了，报上一连好几天都登载了这方面的消息。”机制系的同学们说：党和政府想办法从各方面调集了干部来参加基本建设，而且都是最优秀的干部，足见政府对基本建设是十分重视的。鞍钢进行基本建设的消息使同学们受到更大的鼓舞。钢铁学院一年级的学生们说：不得了，真伟大。有的说：“祖国大规模建设真的开始了”“鞍钢的建设确是大规模的，一个地角螺丝就有一点八吨重”“以前荆江分洪、治淮只是土方工程，而且是人挑，今天鞍钢的建设就是机械化了，工程建设的技术一天天提高了。”
    由于报纸对基本建设的宣传，许多同学都感到自己责任的重大，必须努力学习。有的同学看了社论后说：“谈得很清楚：任务多，干部少。我深深感到自己责任的重大。”有的同学说：“祖国建设发展得这样飞快，不好好学习，就会跟不上了。”尤其是三年级同学，听到毕业同学说他们画的图样苏联专家看了总觉得太旧，要不得，感到自己马上要走上建设岗位，更加需要加紧学习。
