Business Learning Improves Our Understanding of Design Work

Luo Daotan, Chief Technical Engineer, Design Department of the Northeast Electric Power Administration

The Design Department of the Northeast Electric Power Administration conducted ten days of business learning from September 17th to 27th. This learning was very rewarding and further clarified that design and construction cannot be carried out without thorough reconnaissance and investigation. The learning material centered on the editorial summary published in the People's Daily on September 9th regarding the discussion of construction being impossible without correct engineering design – "Implement the Interim Measures for Basic Construction Work". At the same time, it referenced articles published in the People's Daily in August and September on the same theme that correct design and construction cannot be carried out without thorough reconnaissance and investigation, as well as articles of the same nature published in the Northeast Daily. We combined this with past experiences and lessons in our work to clarify our understanding of basic construction so that our future work, especially the current task of collecting data and preparing design task books, can be done better.

During the discussion, we exposed the problems in the design work of the past two years. A total of twenty-eight projects were designed and constructed without thorough reconnaissance and investigation. Among them, some were designed without comprehensive consideration (most commonly, geological, hydrological, meteorological and other data were not fully collected), some were designed neglecting major items (such as no topographic map for Project No. 18, and incomplete load data), and some collected data did not meet design requirements; there were also designs and constructions that did not investigate equipment clearly, and so on.

From this discussion, we further realized that the serious and meticulous working style of Soviet experts is very different from our careless and satisfied with half-baked knowledge working style. For example, when we designed Project No. 19, a part of the layout drawing was determined according to the requirements of the mechanical department. When the Soviet experts questioned the situation of the mechanical part, we could not answer. The experts said, "As a civil engineer in electrical design, how can you design if you do not know the situation of the machinery and electrical aspects?" Then he pointed out that in power plant design, comrades working in machinery, electrical and civil aspects must understand each other and connect well, otherwise the design cannot be done well. He said that in the Soviet Union, if a drawing is related to other departments, it must be signed by the relevant engineers. This also fully illustrates the importance of cooperation between various engineers.

In this discussion, we found the reasons for the errors in the design work, which are mainly in the following aspects:

First, we did not sufficiently recognize the importance of data collection. Therefore, we were often perfunctory in the design. For example, the measurement map of Project No. 19 was pieced together from several small maps, in which the width of the same road was different after merging two maps.

Second, we did not treat our work with a highly responsible attitude. The most obvious is the rough work of checking drawings. In the construction, many phenomena were found that the dimensions on the overall design drawing were inconsistent with the dimensions on the sub-design drawings. After the construction of Project No. 15, it was discovered that two structural drawings that should have been the same were inconsistent with each other. The workers had already constructed according to the wrong drawings, so they had to rework and correct them, causing a loss of manpower and financial resources.

Third, we did not seriously study and implement the basic construction procedures, design steps, and instructions from superiors. The most prominent example is that Project No. 16 started construction on October 10th last year, but the preliminary design was approved on February 1st this year, and the technical design and construction drawings were submitted on April 28th. The architectural drawings of Project No. 19 had not yet been made, and structural drawings were already being made. The entire procedure was disordered.

Fourth, there was a lack of a realistic spirit. The most prominent manifestation is: pursuing "novelty", aiming high, liking to do large designs, disliking to do small designs; liking to design new plants, disliking to remodel old plants. Electrical personnel like to do system structure design, disliking arrangement and installation; mechanical personnel like to do high-pressure and high-temperature things, disliking general mechanical design; civil personnel like to do structural design, disliking surveying and hydrological and meteorological investigation; liking design calculation, disliking making drawings, etc.

After this study, we clarified that the following data must be collected before proceeding with the design: First, load data. Load problem in the power industry is a product sales problem. Preparing too much and you can't sell it; preparing not enough and it hinders production. The load of a substation we designed only reached 25% of the original design from the beginning of operation to now, and the equipment utilization rate is very poor because the load material was not investigated and studied in detail. Recently, when we were doing the task book for several projects, we suggested canceling some projects or postponing some projects because we studied the load and found that these projects were not needed.

Second, water source data. Hydropower depends on water as power, and the water source must be considered in detail before design, which goes without saying. However, the design of thermal power generation cannot ignore the water source. When we designed Project No. 10, we did not thoroughly understand the water source. Now, although the first phase of the project has been completed, the water used for the second phase of the project has become a problem. This is a very painful lesson.

Third, coal source data. In the design of thermal power plants, coal determines the performance of power generation equipment. The coal sample taken in Project No. 13 had a large difference between the analysis results in China and the analysis results in the Soviet Union. The Soviet experts asked to take coal samples again for another analysis, and we should learn from this spirit.

Fourth, hydrological and meteorological data. Hydrological records are very important for hydropower design. For example, the high and low groundwater levels and its corrosiveness have a great impact on the foundation strength. The relationship between meteorological data and electrical design, such as how to consider the load of ice, snow, and wind in the design of transmission lines, is like this.

Fifth, geological data. The bearing capacity test result of the foundation of the plant building of Project No. 19 is 10.5 tons per square meter. The Soviet experts pointed out that drilling must be carried out. The drilling result is 17.5 to 19.8 tons per square meter, which is very different. Project No. 15 started design in 1950. After half of the design was completed, it was suspended due to poor geological conditions, re-drilled, and re-designed. It was only officially constructed this year. In addition, it is also necessary to clarify the source and performance of equipment and materials; in repair or reconstruction projects, old data must be studied; the source of workers and transportation issues must be studied.

Secondly, in our study, we not only recognized the importance of collecting design data, but also recognized the importance of keeping data and using data correctly. Collecting data is certainly not easy, and keeping data is not simple either. Some valuable data is buried in the data library, which is a guilty act against the data. The data library should not be a tomb of data, but should help design. Keeping data is not just keeping old data, but collecting more new data extensively, and organizing it with scientific methods to facilitate designers' use. Making old data play a new role is a very important issue. For example, when selecting the plant site for Project No. 13, using the same topographic map, the plant sites selected by the engineers of our office and the Soviet experts were very different. This shows that the data is dead, and it is all up to the people who use the data. We should use the data well so that the data can be used to its fullest.

Thirdly, we also clearly recognized several issues that determine the quality of design:

First, the design task book should focus on explaining the necessity of construction. Designers should affirm which projects must be done and which can be postponed or not done, so as to save investment for the country and make the investment more reasonable.

Second, the design work must consider the factory site issue from the perspective of national defense and supply, and learn from the Soviet experts to form a team to investigate and study. Deeply consider the distance from raw materials, the distance from water sources, the source of fuel, the disposal of waste materials and the distance from users, transportation conditions, the source of workers... and other issues. The determination of the factory site must obtain the consent of the local government. In the Soviet Union, if the factory site is not approved by the local government, the superior will refuse to review it.

Third, the preliminary design is to prove the technical possibility and economic rationality of the project in the task book. The designer's responsibility is to design the most advanced factory for the country. Therefore, technical and economic indicators should be made to ensure that this design is the most advanced at present. We now lack technical and economic indicators that can be used as a basis, so we must summarize and synthesize from our own designs and connect more with the production side in order to gradually establish them.

Fourth, technical design is to clarify and concretize the projects and technical issues specified in the preliminary design. In the technical design work, the designer's task is how to solve complex technical problems to ensure the realization of the decisions in the preliminary design. In the design of Project No. 19, the use of shallow well water is more economical, but the shallow well water contains iron and is not suitable. We worked hard to develop a water spray gasification iron removal pool, and this spirit of overcoming difficulties is very good.

Fifth, the work of checking drawings must be strengthened. The drawings we took out are full of errors, and many errors are unnecessary. For example, in Project No. 15, the dimensions on the iron structure drawing are mostly inconsistent with the dimensions on the material list. This is certainly not due to low technical ability, but due to insufficient responsible checking, which must be corrected in the future.

Sixth, design work must consider construction and operation issues. Design is for operation, and from design to operation, it must go through construction. Therefore, designers should carefully consider the economic rationality of operation and the possibility in construction. For example, in Project No. 19, some beam-column joints, because the steel bars of the large beams, small beams, and columns are calculated separately and lack overall consideration, it was found in the construction that the steel bars at the intersection of the beams and columns are arranged too densely, and the grout is not easy to leak through, not to mention the stones. Most of us do not have construction experience, so we must humbly accept the opinions of the construction department to improve our design.

We criticized the bourgeois conservative, extravagant waste, and high-aiming and ambitious thoughts, and established an attitude of being responsible to the people and designing seriously. Although we understood the truth that "any revolutionary work is concrete work" very early, we often despised these concrete works in practice. After this study, some comrades have undergone obvious changes in their thinking. For example, the comrades who make drawings recognized the importance of their work to design, and overcame the thought of not wanting to make drawings and only wanting to calculate. This laid the ideological foundation for us to implement the division of labor in design.

    业务学习提高了我们对设计工作的认识
    东北电业管理局设计处  技术主任工程师  罗道坦
    东北电业管理局设计处自九月十七日至二十七日进行了十天的业务学习。这一次学习的收获很大，使我们进一步明确了没有周密的勘察和调查，就不能进行设计和施工。学习的材料是以九月九日人民日报所发表的编辑部关于没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工讨论的总结——“贯彻执行基本建设工作暂行办法”为中心，同时，参考了人民日报八、九月份发表的没有周密的勘察和调查就不能正确的设计和施工的文章，以及东北日报所载同样性质的文章。我们结合着过去工作上的经验教训进行讨论，目的在于明确对基本建设的认识，使我们今后的工作，尤其是把目前进行的搜集资料及编制设计计划任务书的工作做得更好。
    我们在讨论中揭发了两年来设计工作中的毛病，总计有二十八项工程没有周密的勘察和调查就进行了设计和施工。其中有没有经过全面考虑（最普遍的是地质、水文、气象等类资料没收集齐全）就设计的，有忽略了主要项目（如十八号工程地形图未作，负荷资料不全）就设计的，有收集的资料不合设计要求的；也有没有调查清楚器材就设计和施工的等等。
    从这次讨论中，也使我们进一步认识到苏联专家严肃细致的工作作风与我们粗枝大叶、满足于一知半解的工作作风是截然不同的。例如我们设计十九号工程时，有一部分布置图系根据机械部门的要求决定的。苏联专家追问机械部分情况，我们都回答不出来。专家说：“作为一个电业设计的土木工程师，不知道机械和电机的情况，你怎样进行设计呢？”接着他指出在电厂设计中机械、电机和土木各方面工作的同志必须互相了解并很好联系，否则就做不好设计。他说在苏联，如果一张图与其他部门有关系的，就必须有关的工程师签字。这点也充分地说明了各种工程师合作的重要。
    这次讨论中我们找出了造成设计工作发生错误的原因，主要的有如下几方面：
    第一，我们对收集资料工作的重要性认识不足。因而在设计时就常常马虎从事。如十九号工程的测量图系由数张小图拼合而成，其中同一条马路在两张图合并后宽度竟不一样。
    第二，没有以十分负责的态度对待工作。最明显的就是校核图样工作粗糙。在施工中发现总设计图尺寸与分设计图尺寸不合的现象很多。十五号工程施工后，才发现有两张应该相同的结构图互不一致，工人已经按错误的图样施工了，因而不得不返工纠正，造成人力、财力的损失。
    第三，没有认真研究与贯彻基本建设程序、设计步骤及上级指示。最突出的例子如十六号工程已于去年十月十日开工，而今年二月一日才批准初步设计，四月二十八日才提出技术设计及施工图。十九号工程建筑图还没做出来，就在作结构图。整个程序都紊乱了。
    第四，缺少实事求是的精神。最突出的表现是：追求“新奇”，好高鹜远，喜欢作大的设计，不喜欢作小的设计；喜欢作新建厂的设计，不喜欢作改建旧厂的设计。电机人员喜欢作系统结构设计，不喜欢作布置安装；机械人员喜欢作高压高温的东西，不喜欢作一般机械设计；土木人员喜欢作结构设计，不喜欢作测量和水文、气象的调查；喜欢设计计算，不喜欢制描图样等。
    经过这次学习，我们明确了在进行设计前必须注意搜集如下资料：一、负荷资料。负荷问题在电业里面就是一个产品销售的问题。准备多了卖不出去；准备不够又妨碍生产。我们设计的某变电所，因为未详细调查研究负荷材料，因而从开始运转到现在，负荷只达原设计的百分之二十五，设备利用率很差。最近我们做几个工程的计划任务书时，建议取消了某一些工程项目或缓办某一些工程，就是因为研究了负荷，发现不需要这些工程的缘故。
    二、水源资料。水力发电靠水作动力，设计前对水源须详尽考虑，这是不用说的。但是，火力发电的设计也不能忽视水源。我们设计十号工程时，没有彻底弄清水源，现在第一期工程虽已施工完毕，但第二期工程用的水便成了问题。这是一个很惨痛的教训。
    三、煤源资料。在火力发电厂设计中，煤是决定发电设备的性能的。十三号工程中所取的煤样在中国化验分析结果，与在苏联的分析结果相差较大。苏联专家即要求再取煤样另作分析，这种精神我们应该学习。
    四、水文、气象资料。水文记录对于水电设计关系很大，如地下水位高低及其侵蚀性，对基础强度便大有影响。气象资料与电业设计的关系，如送电线设计应该如何考虑冰、雪、风之荷重等便是。
    五、地质资料。十九号工程厂房地基的耐压试验结果是每平方公尺十点五吨。苏联专家指出一定要钻探。钻探结果是每平方公尺十七点五至十九点八吨，相差很远。十五号工程在一九五○年就开始设计，设计了一半，因地质情况恶劣就中止了，重新钻探，再作设计，到今年才正式施工。此外，还必须弄清设备、材料的来源与性能；在修复或改建工程中，必须研究旧有资料；研究工人来源及运输等问题。
    其次，我们在学习中不仅认识收集设计资料的重要性，并且还认识了保管资料和正确使用资料的重要性。收集资料固然是不容易的事，保管资料也不是简单的。有些有价值的资料被湮没在资料库中，这是对资料有罪的行为。不应该使资料库成为资料的坟墓，而要使它能帮助设计。保管资料并不仅仅是保管旧资料，而是广泛地收集更多的新资料，并且用科学的方法，把它整理出来，便利设计者使用。使旧资料发挥新的作用，是一个很重要的问题。如选择十三号工程厂址时，用同一张地形图，我处工程师与苏联专家选定的厂址就相差很多。这就说明了资料是死的，全在使用资料的人，我们应该好好的使用资料，使资料得其所用。
    再次，我们也明确地认识了决定设计质量的几个问题：
    一、设计计划任务书应着重说明修建的必要性。设计人员应该肯定那些工程必须作，那些可以缓作或不作，以便替国家节省投资，使投资用得更合理。
    二、设计工作必须从国防上及供应上来考虑厂址问题，并学习苏联专家的办法组成小组来调查研究。深入考虑距原材料之远近，水源远近，燃料来源，废料的处理与用户距离，运输条件，工人来源……等项问题。厂址之确定必须取得当地政府之同意。在苏联，如厂址未经当地政府批准者，上级就拒绝审核。
    三、初步设计是要证明任务书的工程在技术上之可能与经济上之合理。设计者的责任是替国家设计出最先进的工厂。因此，应作出技术经济指标，以保证在目前这项设计是最先进的。我们现在还缺少可资依据的技术经济指标，因此我们必须从自己的设计中归纳综合，并与生产方面多多连系，以便逐渐建立起来。
    四、技术设计是使初步设计中规定的项目及技术问题明确化与具体化。在技术设计工作中，设计者的任务是如何解决复杂的技术问题保证初步设计中的决定实现。我们在十九号工程设计中，利用浅井水比较经济，但浅井水中含有铁质不适用，我们便努力钻研，做成了喷水气化除铁池，这种克服困难的精神是非常好的。
    五、必须加强图样的校核工作。我们拿出去的图样，错误累累，而且有许多错误是不应该有的。例如十五号工程中铁构图上的尺寸与材料表上的尺寸多数不一致，这当然不是由于技术能力低，而是校核不够负责所致，今后必须纠正。
    六、设计工作必须考虑施工及运转问题。设计是为运转，而由设计到运转，必须经过施工。所以设计者应周密考虑运转上的经济合理，以及施工中的可能。例如十九号工程中有些梁柱接头处，由于大梁、小梁、柱的钢筋是分别计算、缺乏整体的考虑，以致施工中发现梁柱相交处钢筋排列得太密，灰浆都不易漏过，石子更不用说了。我们大多数都没有施工经验，因此就必须虚心接受施工部门对我们提的意见，借以改进我们的设计。
    我们批判了资产阶级的保守、铺张浪费、好高鹜远思想，树立了对人民负责、认真设计的态度。我们虽然很早就明白了“任何革命工作都是具体的工作”这个道理，但在实践中经常轻视这些具体工作。经过这次学习，有些同志在思想上有了明显的转变。例如制图的同志认识了他们的工作对于设计之重要性，克服了不愿描图，只愿计算的思想。这给我们实行设计中的专业分工打下了思想基础。
