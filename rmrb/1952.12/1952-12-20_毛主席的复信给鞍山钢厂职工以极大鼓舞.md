After receiving Chairman Mao’s reply letter congratulating them on their new achievements in open-hearth steelmaking and encouraging them to produce high-quality steel next year, all the workers of the open-hearth steelmaking plant of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company told each other the news. A wave of cheers rose from the site. Propagandists wrote out Chairman Mao's letter in large red characters late at night. The workers on the night shift, some were reading it aloud, some were so happy that they jumped up before they could finish reading, and some rushed to tell their worker brothers at various sites in the middle of the night. Plant Director Ma of the steelmaking plant first thanked the Soviet experts for their selfless assistance for this glorious achievement. The experts shook their hands tightly and congratulated them with the same excitement. On the 18th, Plant Director Ma wrote a congratulatory letter to the brother factories of Anshan Iron and Steel, saying: "This is not only the glory of the steelmaking plant, but also the glory of all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. Thank you for your strong support to the steelmaking plant!" In order to respond to Chairman Mao's commendation with practical actions, more than 50 technicians in the plant held a technical research meeting in the morning to specifically formulate measures and plans to improve technology, to further integrate with workers, and to produce more high-quality steel for the country. In the afternoon, all the workers in the plant held a workers' representative meeting. Everyone agreed that the steelmaking plant could have such new achievements because of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Glory belongs to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. At the meeting, the representatives summarized the production competition from November 11th to December 17th for thirty-seven days in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and found the direction for improving the steelmaking work. The meeting decided to further increase the production increase plan. The steelmaking plant has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule on December 10th, and they have now decided to increase production for the country by 5.7 percent of the annual plan before the end of the year. Under the new encouragement, they also proposed: to increase production by another 2 percent of the annual task. In addition, they firmly stated that they would implement Chairman Mao's instructions, strive to complete the task of producing high-quality steel in 1953, and support the country's large-scale economic construction.

    毛主席的复信给鞍山钢厂职工以极大鼓舞
    【新华社鞍山十八日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂全体职工在十七日晚接到毛主席祝贺他们在平炉炼钢生产上的新成就并勉励他们明年炼好优质钢的回信后，职工们都纷纷奔走相告。现场上腾起了一片欢呼声。宣传员们在深夜用红色大字写出毛主席的来信，上夜班的工人们，有的在高声朗诵，有的来不及看完就欢乐得跳了起来，有的在午夜奔告各个现场工人兄弟。炼钢厂马厂长对这个光荣的成就首先感谢苏联专家的无私帮助，专家紧紧握着他们的手，也以同样兴奋的心情向他们致贺。十八日马厂长给鞍钢各兄弟厂写了报喜信，说：“这不仅是炼钢厂的光荣，也是全鞍钢工人同志们的光荣。感谢大家对炼钢厂的大力支援！”为了以实际行动回答毛主席对他们的嘉勉，全厂五十多名技术人员上午举行技术研究会，具体制订了改进技术的措施计划，要进一步和工人密切结合，为国家炼出更多质量优良的钢。下午全厂职工举行了职工代表会议，大家一致认为：炼钢厂能有这样新的成就，是由于毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，光荣是属于毛主席和中国共产党的。代表们在会上以批评和自我批评的精神，总结了自十一月十一日到十二月十七日三十七天中的生产竞赛，找出了改进炼钢工作的努力方向。会议决定再进一步提高增产计划。炼钢厂已于十二月十日提前完成了全年生产计划，他们现决定到年底以前再为国家增产等于全年计划百分之五点七的钢。在新的鼓舞下，他们又提出了：还要增产等于全年任务百分之二的钢。此外，他们还坚决表示：要执行毛主席的指示，在一九五三年努力完成生产优质钢的任务，以支援全国大规模的经济建设。
