    We Miss Our Soviet Comrades
    Made by Miao Di and Zhao Zhifang
    Seven, When I didn't understand something, I would consult Comrade Darasov. Although he explained the principles to me very enthusiastically, we experienced great difficulties in our work because we didn't speak the same language.
    Eight, Comrade Darasov sensed that I was feeling troubled. One night, he spoke with me and told me that the difficulty of language barriers could be solved by making an effort to learn from each other.
    Nine, During our days off, we studied each other's languages together. Picking up a teacup, I taught him the Chinese word for "teacup," and he taught me the Russian word, "chashka." Our friendship was established more intimately in our daily life.
