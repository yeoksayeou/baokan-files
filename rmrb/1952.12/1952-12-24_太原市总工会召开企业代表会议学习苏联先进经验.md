    Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions Convenes Meeting of Enterprise Representatives to Study Advanced Soviet Experiences
    From the 4th to the 5th of this month, the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of representatives from various state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in the city to study advanced Soviet experiences. The purpose of the meeting was to further educate the masses on the superiority of advanced Soviet experiences by summarizing and promoting them from the bottom up and rewarding model workers, to create a new high tide in learning from advanced Soviet experiences, and to prepare conditions for completing next year's production plan. More than 400 representatives of model workers, staff, teams, and workshops from various factories and mines who are learning from advanced Soviet experiences attended the meeting. Guo Qin'an, Deputy Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xi Bingwu, Chairman of the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions, both gave reports at the meeting.

    Over the past three years, especially since the launch of the increased production and conservation campaign this year, state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in Taiyuan City have achieved great success in learning from advanced Soviet experiences, promoting 42 types of advanced Soviet experiences. Workers and staff throughout the city have found more than 13,000 "tricks" and summarized them into 260 types of advanced experiences using the "Kovalev Method." After these advanced experiences were promoted, production rapidly increased. For example, steel production increased eightfold, machine production increased twenty-fivefold, the construction industry increased by one and a half to twenty-seven times, and coal mining increased by 68 percent. In the process of promoting advanced Soviet experiences, many model individuals, teams, and workshops have emerged in various units. For example, the workers of the steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, led by Wang Guiying, under the guidance of Soviet experts, enhanced their sense of ownership and combined learning from advanced Soviet experiences with creative labor, learning the Soviet rapid steelmaking method, which increased steel production eightfold and reduced the scrap rate from 80 percent to less than 10 percent. In the construction industry, the Hou Jinju team, known as the "Glorious Shock Brigade," after learning the Su Changyou bricklaying method, patiently educated workers in other teams, thus leading 220 teams in the construction industry to learn the Su Changyou bricklaying method. Zhao Daqing, a worker at the Shanxi Machinery Factory, inspired by the Soviet advanced experience of "multi-tool multi-edge cutting method," created a three-flute milling cutter, which solved a key problem for the factory. Many facts have proven that production can be improved only by learning from advanced Soviet experiences. The current problems in Taiyuan City in promoting advanced Soviet experiences are that units that have already learned and promoted them have not consolidated their achievements. The main reasons are threefold: First, the leadership lacks planned and timely summaries and promotion of experience to educate the masses; second, some engineering and technical personnel still have complacency and cannot closely integrate with workers; and third, workers are not yet proficient in mastering new technologies and sometimes unconsciously use old habits of operation.

    The meeting believes that the future direction should be to consolidate the achievements already made and continue to improve on the basis of consolidation, making the learning of advanced Soviet experiences a regular practice. There are five specific methods: First, further promote the superiority of advanced Soviet experiences in various ways to make the masses consciously learn from advanced Soviet experiences; second, strengthen leadership and give full play to the organizational role of trade unions; trade unions and administrations should sign collective contracts, making the promotion of advanced Soviet experiences one of the contents; third, in conjunction with the investigation, determination, and learning and promotion of advanced Soviet experiences, summarize and revise technical operating procedures, and regularly check the implementation of technical operating procedures, so that they become a conscious and habitual operating method for the masses; fourth, technical personnel should closely integrate with workers to help workers summarize and improve scattered "tricks" to the level of advanced experience; and fifth, pay attention to safety, hygiene, and reward work to encourage greater labor enthusiasm among the masses.

    At the end of the conference, model workers, teams, and workshops in promoting advanced Soviet experiences were rewarded, with a total of 30 awarded workshops, 125 teams, and 166 individuals.

    太原市总工会召开企业代表会议学习苏联先进经验
    太原市总工会于本月四日至五日，召开该市各国营、地方国营企业学习苏联先进经验代表会议。会议的目的在于通过自下而上的总结推广苏联先进经验、奖励模范，以进一步教育群众认识苏联先进经验的优越性，造成学习苏联先进经验的新高潮，为完成明年生产计划准备条件。参加这次会议的有各厂矿学习苏联先进经验的模范工人、职员、小组和车间的代表四百余人。中共太原市委副书记郭钦安、太原市总工会主席席炳午均在会上作了报告。
    三年来，特别是今年开展增产节约运动以来，太原市各国营、地方国营企业学习苏联先进经验已取得了巨大成绩，推广了苏联先进经验四十二种。全市职工找到了一万三千余件窍门，并用“郭瓦廖夫工作法”把它们总结成二百六十种先进经验。这些先进经验得到推广以后，生产就迅速提高。如钢铁生产提高了八倍，机器生产提高了二十五倍，建筑业提高了一倍半至二十七倍，煤炭开采提高了百分之六十八。在推广苏联先进经验中，各单位还涌现了许多模范人物、小组和车间。如以王贵英为首的太原钢铁厂炼钢部职工，在苏联专家的指导下，提高了主人翁自觉，把学习苏联先进经验与创造性的劳动相结合，学习了苏联的快速炼钢法，使钢的产量提高八倍，报废率由百分之八十降低到百分之十以下。建筑业中被称为“光荣的突击组”的侯金聚小组在学会了苏长有砌砖法后，曾耐心地教育别组工人，因而带动了建筑业二百二十个小组都学会了苏长有砌砖法。山西机械厂元车工人赵大庆，在苏联先进经验“多刀多刃切削法”的启发下，创造了三刃铣刀，解决了该厂关键问题。许多事实证明了：必须学习苏联先进经验，才能把生产提高一步。太原市在推广苏联先进经验方面，目前存在的问题是已经学习与推广的单位，没有把已取得的成绩巩固下来，其主要原因有三：一是领导上缺乏有计划地、及时地总结推广的经验，以教育群众；二是有些工程技术人员还有自满思想，不能和工人紧密结合；三是工人对新技术的掌握还不熟练，有时还不自觉地用旧习惯操作。
    会议认为今后的方针应该是：巩固已得的成绩，在巩固的基础上继续提高，把学习苏联先进经验经常化。具体的办法有五点：一、进一步以各种方式反复宣传苏联先进经验的优越性，使群众自觉地学习苏联先进经验；二、加强领导，充分发挥工会的组织作用；工会和行政订定集体合同，把推广苏联先进经验作为其中的一个内容；三、结合查定和学习、推广苏联先进经验，总结、修订技术操作规程，经常检查技术操作规程的执行情况，使之变为群众自觉的、习惯的操作方法；四、技术人员要和工人密切结合，帮助工人把分散的窍门总结提高到先进经验的水平；五、注意安全卫生和奖励工作，以鼓舞群众更高的劳动热情。
    大会最后对推广苏联先进经验的模范职工、小组、车间进行奖励，计受奖车间三十个，小组一百二十五个，个人一百六十六名。
