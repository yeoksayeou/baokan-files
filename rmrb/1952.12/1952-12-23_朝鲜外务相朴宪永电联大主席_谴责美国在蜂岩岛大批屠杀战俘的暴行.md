Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 22nd: Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong cabled UN General Assembly President Pearson on the 21st, condemning the US side's atrocities in the mass slaughter of our captured personnel on Koje Island. The cable is as follows:
    Mr. Pearson, President of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly,
    The Government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic issued a statement on December 17th of this year, stating that it cannot accept the "resolution" passed by the United Nations General Assembly. In our reply telegram, we pointed out that this resolution violates the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, and this resolution further favors the US attempt to forcibly detain Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighters captured by the US under the deceptive principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation."
    The Government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic has repeatedly protested the atrocities and massacres perpetrated by the Americans in the South Korean prisoner-of-war camps, which have long become death camps, under the deceptive guise of "voluntary repatriation."
    The Government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic has repeatedly exposed to the world the facts of the mass killings, barbaric tortures, and beastly interrogations and beatings perpetrated by the US military authorities in these death camps.
    Regardless of these, the Americans perpetrated a new bloody crime on Koje Island on December 14th of this year, which is similar to the massacres perpetrated by the US military authorities on Koje Island against many unarmed people in the past.
    According to announced news, on this day, eighty-two of our captured personnel were slaughtered in the prisoner-of-war camp, and one hundred and twenty were injured, several of whom sustained fatal injuries. The Americans used various weapons to carry out a genocidal massacre against our unarmed captured personnel. What does this bloody incident on Koje Island mean?
    This proves that the US military command has not been punished in any way, continues to carry out a shameful policy of abuse and violence against prisoners, and means that the purpose of the US military command is not to stop but to attempt to expand the bloody war they are waging in Korea. With this purpose in mind, the United States has even suspended the Panmunjom conference. Encouraged by the decisions of the United Nations General Assembly and without receiving any due punishment, the American executioners are, for this purpose, more cruelly, brutally, and systematically slaughtering the patriots of our country.
    These crimes perpetrated by the Americans have aroused the anger not only of our people but also of all peace-loving people in the world.
    It has become an urgent requirement to stop these heinous crimes and immediately stop the implementation of the beastly prisoner-slaughtering plan manufactured by the Americans to continue slaughtering our captured personnel in American hands.
    The Government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic once again draws the attention of the member states of the United Nations to these atrocities now being perpetrated by the Americans in the prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea, and expects the United Nations to take urgent measures to immediately stop the atrocities that are wantonly trampling on all international laws. We can no longer tolerate these situations, and the criminals who created these bloody incidents must be punished. These murderers will never escape their criminal responsibility. I request that you convey this statement to all member states of the United Nations, and I respectfully extend my regards to you, Mr. President.

    Pak Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Korean Democratic People's Republic

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永电联大主席
    谴责美国在蜂岩岛大批屠杀战俘的暴行
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在二十一日致电联合国大会主席皮尔逊，谴责美方在蜂岩岛大批屠杀我被俘人员的暴行。电文如下：联合国第七届大会主席皮尔逊先生
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已在今年十二月十七日发表声明，不能接受联合国大会所通过的“决议案”。在我们的回电中，就指出了这个决议案违背了一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约，这个决议案使美国企图用强迫的方法扣留美方所俘掳的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士的所谓“自愿遣返”的欺骗原则更加有利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，曾数次对美国人在早已变为死亡营的南朝鲜俘虏营里，在“自愿遣返”的欺骗言辞下肆行的暴行与屠杀提出了抗议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已数次向全世界揭露了美军当局在这些死亡营里所肆行的大量屠杀、野蛮的拷问及野兽般的审讯和殴打的事实。
    不顾这些，美国人今年十二月十四日在蜂岩岛又肆行了一个新的流血罪行，这与美军当局过去在巨济岛对很多不持有任何武器的人们肆行的那种大量屠杀的罪行是同样的。
    根据公告消息，这天在俘虏营里有八十二名我方被俘人员被屠杀，一百二十名负伤，其中数名负了致命的伤。美国人对没有任何武器的我方被俘人员，使用各种武器肆行歼灭性的屠杀。在蜂岩岛所发生的这个血腥事件意味着什么呢？
    这证明了美军司令部没有受到任何惩罚，对俘虏们继续进行着可耻的虐待和暴力政策，并意味着美军司令部的目的不是要停止而是企图扩大他们在朝鲜进行着的流血战争，美国在这样的目的下连板门店会议也中止了。受到联合国大会决定的鼓舞、没有受到任何应得惩罚的美国刽子手们，正为此种目的在更加残忍地、残酷地、有系统地屠杀我们祖国的爱国者。
    美国人肆行着的这些罪行，不但激起了我国人民而且激起了全世界一切爱好和平人民的愤怒。
    制止这些凶恶的罪行，并立即制止美国人为继续屠杀掌握在美国人手中的我方被俘人员而制造的野兽般的屠杀俘虏计划的实现，已成为紧急的要求。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次唤起联合国会员国注意美国人现在在南朝鲜各战俘营所肆行着的这些暴行，并期望联合国采取紧急措施，即时制止蛮横地蹂躏一切国际法规的暴行。我们再也不能容忍这些事态，制造这些流血事件的罪犯是一定要被惩办的，这些杀人罪犯是什么时候都逃脱不了他们的犯罪责任的。我要求你将这一声明传达给全体联合国会员国，并谨向你——主席先生表示我的敬意。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永
    一九五二年十二月二十一日
