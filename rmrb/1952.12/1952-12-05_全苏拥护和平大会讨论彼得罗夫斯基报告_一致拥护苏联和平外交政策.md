(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 4th) The Fourth All-Soviet Peace Conference, which opened on the evening of the 2nd, began discussing the report by Petrovsky, President of Moscow State University, on "The Soviet People's Struggle to Defend and Consolidate Peace" after hearing it. The discussion continued at the morning session on the 3rd.

After the discussion began at the meeting on the 2nd, the first speaker was N. Sokolov, a famous steelworker and Stalin Prize winner. He spoke about the achievements of the Ural steelworkers in peaceful construction. He then said: The workers, collective farm members, and scientific and cultural workers of the Urals have entrusted me to express to the conference their unwavering determination to defend world peace and their resentment towards the instigators of a new war. We will continue to work selflessly because each of us understands that the more high-quality steel is produced, the more consolidated and stronger our Soviet country—the bulwark of world peace—will be.

N. Sinmannikov, Chairman of the Ukrainian Peace Protection Committee, said: The working people of Ukraine will never forget the enormous pain and disasters suffered by the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War. Now, the American reactionaries, who are妄想称霸世界 , are preparing to expand a new war. The working people of the Soviet Union are doing their utmost to consolidate the economic strength of the Soviet Union. The convening of the Fourth All-Soviet Peace Conference is to once again demonstrate that the Soviet people have a strong determination to implement the policy of international cooperation for the sake of peace and security.

M. Pirova, Chairman of the Khrushchev Collective Farm in Moscow Oblast, said: As a Soviet citizen, a woman, and a mother, I cannot remain silent when discussing the issue of defending peace. Every Soviet man and woman wholeheartedly desires world peace and hates warmongers. The Soviet people vigilantly defend peace. With us are the People's China and the People's Democratic countries, as well as all peace-loving people around the world. Our strength is incomparably great. Warmongers must remember this!

Alexius, Patriarch of All Russia and Moscow, on behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church, told the delegates attending the conference: The delegates should instruct the Soviet delegates attending the Vienna World People's Peace Conference to hold high the banner of the Soviet people of all nationalities dedicated to peace, and instruct them to support all resolutions that can save mankind from the threat of destruction. Alexius also called on church leaders and all religious people in all countries on behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify and expand the struggle for peace.

K.S. Kuznetsova, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, spoke about the struggle of the Soviet trade unions to strengthen the cause of peace and the friendship of people of all countries, and used facts to prove that the international relations of the Soviet trade unions are expanding. She said: The Soviet trade unions will continue to expand friendly relations with the working people of all countries, continue to expose and smash the evil plans of war makers and their lackeys in the labor movement, and strive to strengthen the unity of international trade unions.

The morning session on the 3rd was chaired by N. Bazhanova, a famous social leader of the Kazakh Republic. Members of trade union and cultural delegations from China, Australia, Ceylon, Chile, Bulgaria, Italy and other countries who are visiting Moscow were invited to attend the meeting.

The first speaker was Belarusian poet Piotr Glebko. He emphasized that American imperialists want to use the Iron Curtain to cover up their crimes and ignite another world war. However, the Soviet people need green forest belts to prevent the invasion of dry winds; and need steel and cement dams to divert water to irrigate dry deserts. We are selflessly fighting for peace, not because we are weak or afraid of the threats of warmongers, but because we do not want to seek world hegemony and seize the world's wealth.

Alexander Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: Soviet scientists are happy to contribute all their strength, talents and ideas to the cause of peaceful construction in their country. On the one hand, Soviet scientists are expanding international scientific cooperation, and on the other hand, they do not forget their responsibility to expose the pseudo-science of imperialism, which is specifically against mankind. Nesmeyanov also called on scientists around the world to join the ranks of peace fighters together with their people.

Ivan Durtanov, a famous foreman at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant, said: Our will to defend peace is as hard as steel. We are not afraid of the threats of warmongers. The steel we refine is used for peaceful construction, but if necessary, we can also produce enough steel to repel any enemy who dares to attack our motherland.

Archbishop Melchizedek of the Georgian Orthodox Church said: For religious workers, there is no more glorious and urgent task at present than to fight for peace. He said: Believers living in peaceful and democratic countries should call on believers in the United States, Britain, France and other countries to fight with all their strength to defend peace.

The following also spoke at the two meetings: Soviet Academy of Architecture President Mordvinov, Soviet famous linguist V. Vinogradov, Soviet famous writer Polevoy, Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League Central Committee Secretary Dumanova, Kamchatka fisherman Mariakin and others. In their speeches, they unanimously supported the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy and expressed the Soviet people's strong will and strength to defend peace.

    全苏拥护和平大会讨论彼得罗夫斯基报告
    一致拥护苏联和平外交政策
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二日晚间开幕的第四届全苏拥护和平大会，在听取了国立莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基关于“苏联人民为保卫和巩固和平而斗争”的报告后，就开始讨论这个报告。讨论在三日上午会议上继续进行。
    二日会议讨论开始后，首先由著名钢铁工人、斯大林奖金得奖人恩·索科洛夫发言。他谈到了乌拉尔钢铁工人的和平建设的成就，他接着说：乌拉尔的工人、集体农庄庄员、科学和文化工作者，委托我向大会表达他们保卫世界和平的不可动摇的决心以及他们对新战争煽动者的愤恨。我们将要继续忘我地工作，因为我们每个人都懂得：质量好的钢铁生产得愈多，我们苏维埃国家——世界和平的堡垒就将愈加巩固，愈加强大。
    乌克兰拥护和平委员会主席恩·辛曼尼柯发言说：乌克兰的劳动人民永远也不会忘记苏联人民在卫国战争中所遭受到的巨大痛苦和灾难。现在，妄想称霸世界的美国反动派正在进行扩大新战争的准备。苏联的劳动人民正在以全力来巩固苏联的经济力量。召开第四届全苏拥护和平大会，就是要再度表明：苏联人民有坚强的决心为和平与安全的利益而执行国际合作的方针。
    莫斯科州赫鲁晓夫集体农庄主席玛·皮洛娃说：作为一个苏联公民、一个妇女和母亲，在讨论保卫和平的问题时，我不能默不作声。每一个苏联男人和妇女都衷心要求世界和平和痛恨战争贩子。苏联人民警惕地保卫着和平。和我们在一起的有人民中国和人民民主国家以及全世界所有爱好和平的人民。我们的力量无比强大。战争贩子必须记住这一点！
    全俄罗斯及莫斯科总主教阿列修斯代表俄罗斯东正教向出席大会的代表说：代表们应该责成出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的苏联代表高高举起苏联各族人民致力于和平的旗帜，并责成他们拥护能够拯救人类免受毁灭的威胁的各项决议。阿列修斯并代表俄罗斯东正教号召各教会负责人和世界各国所有信仰宗教的人们加紧进行和扩大争取和平的斗争。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记凯·斯·库兹涅佐娃发言时谈到了苏联工会为加强和平事业和各国人民的友好所进行的斗争，并用事实来证明苏联工会的国际联系正在扩大。她说：苏联工会将继续扩大和各国劳动人民的友好联系，继续揭发和粉碎战争制造者和它们在劳工运动中的走卒的罪恶计划，并为加强国际工会的团结而斗争。
    三日上午会议由哈萨克共和国著名社会领袖涅·巴扎诺娃担任主席。正在莫斯科参观的中国、澳大利亚、锡兰、智利、保加利亚、意大利等国工会和文化代表团的团员们，应邀参加了会议。
    首先发言的是白俄罗斯诗人彼奥特·格列勃科。他强调说：美帝国主义者想用铁幕来遮盖他们的罪行并燃起另一次世界大战的战火。但是，苏联人民需要绿色林带来防止旱风的侵袭；需要钢骨水泥的堤坝，来引水灌溉干燥的沙漠。我们忘我地为和平而斗争，并不是因为我们软弱无能或是害怕战争贩子的威胁，而是因为我们并不想谋取世界霸权和夺取世界上的财富。
    苏联科学院院长亚历山大·涅斯米扬诺夫说：苏联科学家们都乐于把他们的全部力量、才能和思想贡献给他们国家的和平建设的事业。苏联科学家们一方面在扩大科学方面的国际科学合作，一方面也不忘他们有责任揭发帝国主义专与人类为敌的伪科学。涅斯米扬诺夫并号召全世界科学家和本国人民一道参加和平战士的行列。
    莫斯科“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂著名领班伊凡·杜尔塔诺夫发言说：我们保卫和平的意志像钢一样坚硬。我们不怕战争贩子的威胁。我们炼出来的钢是用来从事和平建设的，但是，如果必要的话，我们也可以生产足够的钢，来击退胆敢进攻我们祖国的任何敌人。
    格鲁吉亚正教大主教梅尔希塞杰克发言说：对宗教工作者说来，目前没有比为和平而斗争再光荣、再紧急的任务了。他说：生活在和平、民主国家中的教徒应当号召美国、英国、法国和其他国家的教徒以全力为保卫和平而斗争。
    在两次会议上发言的还有：苏联建筑科学院院长莫尔得维诺夫、苏联著名语言学家维·维诺格拉多夫、苏联名作家波列伏依、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记杜马诺娃、堪察加渔人马里亚金等人。他们在发言中一致支持苏联政府的和平外交政策，并表达了苏联人民保卫和平的坚强意志和力量。
