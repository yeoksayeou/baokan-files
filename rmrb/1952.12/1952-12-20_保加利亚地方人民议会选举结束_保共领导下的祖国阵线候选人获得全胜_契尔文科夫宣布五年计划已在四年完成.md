Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 18th — The elections for the Bulgarian local People's Councils, held on the 14th, have concluded, with the candidates nominated by the Fatherland Front under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party achieving a complete victory. According to an announcement by the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, in the elections for the People's Councils of states, cities, counties, towns, districts, and villages, approximately 98 to 99 percent of voters participated, and of those who voted, 98 to 99 percent elected the candidates nominated by the Fatherland Front. A total of 59,648 deputies to local People's Councils at all levels were elected, of whom 43,221, or more than 72 percent, are Communists led by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Valko Chervenkov, or members of the Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union.

Two days before the elections, on December 12th, the leader of the Bulgarian people, Chervenkov, in his capacity as a candidate for deputy to the Sofia City People's Council and a candidate for deputy to the Dimitrov District People's Council, met with voters in the Dimitrov District. In his speech, he thanked the voters for their trust in him. Speaking about the achievements of Bulgaria's socialist construction, he said: Bulgaria's first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) has been completed ahead of schedule in four years. Next year, Bulgaria will begin implementing its second Five-Year Plan. The first year of the second Five-Year Plan has been approved by the government. According to this plan, Bulgaria's total industrial output in 1953 will increase by more than 16 percent compared to 1952, and investment in the national economy will increase by 22 percent. Chervenkov's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the voters.

On the day of the election, Bulgaria was filled with high political enthusiasm. Early in the morning, Bulgarians went to the polls in groups, some singing and dancing. In the evening, hundreds and thousands of working people gathered in front of propaganda stations or polling stations to celebrate the victory of the local People's Council elections. At the same time, the Bulgarian people reviewed with excitement the new achievements they had made with the brotherly assistance of the Soviet people. Bulgaria, which had lacked cement not long ago, now has the largest cement factory in the Balkans, the "Volcan" cement factory. In the past, Bulgaria had to import chemicals from abroad, but now they have the Stalin Chemical Factory, which supplies the needs of socialist agriculture. Previously, they had no machine manufacturing industry, but now the Bulgarian People's Government has organized the production of locomotives, trucks, electric motors, and machine tools. Currently, a steel plant named after Lenin is being built in the Dimitrov District near Sofia. Several powerful power stations have been put into operation. Many farmers' homes are now using electric lights. In 1952, there were 12,000 tractors and more than 1,000 combine harvesters working in the Bulgarian fields. Thanks to the government's water conservancy projects, the Dobruja steppe, which was once barren, and the dry northern Bulgaria are now gradually becoming fertile fields.

    保加利亚地方人民议会选举结束
    保共领导下的祖国阵线候选人获得全胜
    契尔文科夫宣布五年计划已在四年完成
    【新华社十八日讯】索非亚消息：保加利亚人民十四日举行的地方人民议会选举已经结束，保加利亚共产党领导下的祖国阵线所提出的候选人获得了完全的胜利。据保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团宣布，在州、市、县、镇、区和村的人民议会选举中，约有百分之九十八到九十九以上的选民参加了投票，投票者中有百分之九十八到九十九以上的人选举了祖国阵线提出的候选人。当选的各级地方人民议会议员共五万九千六百四十八人，其中有四万三千二百二十一人，即百分之七十二以上，是以保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记维尔科·契尔文科夫为首的共产党员或是保加利亚农民联盟的盟员。
    在举行选举的前两天，十二月十二日，保加利亚人民领袖契尔文科夫以保加利亚首都索非亚市人民议会议员候选人和该市季米特洛夫区人民议会议员候选人的资格，与季米特洛夫区的选民们会见。他在讲话中感谢选民们对他的信任。他在谈到保加利亚社会主义建设的成就时说：保加利亚的第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）已经提前在四年内完成了。明年，保加利亚就要开始实行第二个五年计划。第二个五年计划的第一年计划已获政府批准，根据这个计划，保加利亚一九五三年的工业总产量将比一九五二年增加百分之十六以上，国民经济投资额将增多百分之二十二。契尔文科夫的讲话时时为选民们的热烈掌声所打断。
    在选举的这一天，保加利亚各地洋溢着高涨的政治热情。保加利亚人民一清早就成群结队，有的还载歌载舞地到投票站去投票。到了晚上，在各处宣传站或投票站的前面，围拢着成百成千的劳动人民，欢庆地方人民议会选举的胜利。与此同时，保加利亚人民并以兴奋的心情回顾了他们在苏联人民兄弟般援助下所取得的新成就。保加利亚在不久以前还缺乏水泥，现在已经有了巴尔干半岛上最大的一个水泥厂——“火山”水泥厂。过去保加利亚要从国外输入化学品，现在他们有了供应社会主义农业需要的斯大林化学工厂。以前他们没有机器制造业，现在保加利亚的人民政府已组织了机车、卡车、电动机和工作母机的生产。目前，在索非亚附近的季米特洛夫区正在建造一个以列宁为名的钢铁厂。几个效能强大的电力站已经开工。许多农民的住房已经使用着电灯。一九五二年，在保加利亚田间工作的有一万二千架拖拉机和一千多架联合收割机。由于政府兴修水利，以前是荒芜不毛之区的多布鲁查草原以及干燥的保加利亚北部现在逐渐变成了肥沃的田地。
