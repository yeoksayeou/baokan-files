    The Peasants' "Little Bank"
    ——On the Credit Cooperatives of Pingyao County, Shanxi Province
    Xiao Kong
    By October of this year, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, had established eighteen credit cooperatives, with a total share capital of more than 150 million yuan, absorbing 496,000 jin of stored grain, deposits of 260 million yuan, and accumulating 26.74 million yuan in public reserve funds. These eighteen credit cooperatives are linked to one hundred and fifty-eight villages (nearly half of the county's villages). By the end of this year, Pingyao County plans to expand to twenty-five credit cooperatives, which can be linked to two hundred and ten villages. In this way, sixty percent of the county will have organized and guided rural credit activities, and the scope of usury will be greatly reduced.
    The establishment and development of credit cooperatives in Pingyao County has been steady, learning from the lessons of "inserting willow branches" and "blooming everywhere." The so-called "inserting willow branches" means that the higher authorities assign tasks, and the lower levels, in order to "complete the task," establish credit cooperatives regardless of the local economic conditions and the demands of the masses, just like "inserting willow branches." Some happen to be right and can take root, sprout, grow, and thrive, while others cannot take root, and collapse as soon as the cadres leave. In order to "bloom everywhere," some counties once put forward the slogan of "one share per household," which resulted in disguised coercion of peasants to buy shares or make deposits. This turned a good thing into a bad one and created difficulties for the development of credit cooperatives. Pingyao County learned from these lessons, and when establishing credit cooperatives, called on cadres to first investigate the economic conditions and the demands of the masses clearly, then propose methods for organizing credit cooperatives to the masses, and help the masses to organize themselves consciously. In this way, the foundation of the credit cooperatives was solid.
    After the credit cooperatives were organized, the county leadership paid great attention to establishing a democratic system within the cooperatives and strengthened the People's Bank's policy guidance of the credit cooperatives. Taking Yuebi Cooperative as an example: the members' meeting passed the articles of association, elected twenty-five members' representatives, nine directors, and five supervisors, and stipulated meeting systems. Except for busy farming seasons such as plowing and harvesting, meetings can generally be held on time. The loan plan of the credit cooperative is discussed and approved by the members' representative meeting and then submitted to the People's Bank for approval. The treatment of the three cadres who are partially detached from production is also discussed and stipulated by the members' representative meeting. The directors and supervisors summarize and plan their work on time, send business reports to the People's Bank, report their work to the representative meeting or the members' meeting, and announce the final accounts to the members' meeting at the end of the year. The credit cooperative has receipts for deposits and loans, a system for expenditures, and membership cards for members. The director of the credit cooperative regularly reports his work to the district business office of the People's Bank. The county People's Bank regularly convenes meetings of credit cooperative directors to check, summarize, and arrange work.
    The business of credit cooperatives in Pingyao County has developed rapidly. Taking Yuebi Cooperative as an example, taking 1950 as 100, in 1951, share capital increased to 474, deposits increased to 381, and loans increased to 197; in October 1952, share capital increased to 1256, deposits increased to 1210, and loans increased to 697.
    It should be noted here that: in 1950, Yuebi Cooperative was only a cooperative in one village. By 1952, it had developed into a joint village cooperative of fourteen villages. The cooperative signed deposit and loan contracts with thirty-one mutual aid teams, and grain storage increased substantially. The cooperative also established six credit groups in the surrounding villages, forming a rural credit network, making it convenient for peasants to deposit, withdraw, borrow, and repay. The peasants in Yuebi Village said: "We never thought that the capital of 1,740 jin of grain, which could not even buy a mule at that time, can now buy five hundred mules." "The credit cooperative has become our little bank."
    The operating methods of credit cooperatives are very flexible: "Both physical objects and currency are convenient, and you can choose to deposit and withdraw grain and money." According to the operating history of these credit cooperatives, they generally start by operating simple physical deposit and loan businesses, gradually develop to operating mixed physical object and currency businesses, and now some cooperatives have gradually begun to act as agents for national bank savings, insurance, and agricultural loan collection. The types of physical objects are also diverse. Originally, it was stipulated that millet, wheat, and cotton should be operated, but now beans, sorghum, and corn are also operated. The conversion methods include: deposit and loan based on actual value (according to the price of the supply and marketing cooperative), deposit in kind and loan in kind, deposit in kind and loan in currency, etc. However, most still calculate in kind and pay in currency, which peasants find "convenient" and "reassuring." Currency deposits and loans have just begun and account for a small amount. There are two reasons why credit cooperatives mainly operate in kind: one is that the masses have concerns about seasonal differences, and the other is that there is a lack of currency in rural areas, and there are more material exchanges, and the currency supply cannot keep up.
    It is a good way to develop the business of credit cooperatives to sign contracts between credit cooperatives and mutual aid teams. In July, five cooperatives, including Dongquan and Yuebi, signed contracts with fifty-four mutual aid teams, lending 25 million yuan and 8,200 jin of grain. The mutual aid teams guaranteed to deposit all the surplus grain from the autumn harvest into the cooperative. As a result of the implementation, the credit cooperatives expanded their business, increased their share capital, and strengthened the link between credit cooperatives and production.
    What role have the credit cooperatives in Pingyao County played? First, in the patriotic production increase movement, they helped the masses of peasants purchase 216 draft animals, 38 new farm tools, repaired and purchased more than 1,300 old farm tools, dug 69 new wells and old wells, purchased 1.72 million jin of fertilizer, and bought 350 pigs and sheep. More than 1,000 peasant households have obtained living loans, and 400 handicraft households have obtained revolving convenience. Second, crack down on usury. Taking Yuebi Village as an example: During the lean months of this year, more than 30 households wanted to sell rapeseed seedlings to solve their livelihood problems. The credit cooperative provided them with 6,000 jin of grain, and they did not sell the seedlings. A merchant named Li Chenggong used to lend more than 30 dan of grain to more than 20 households every year, borrowing in the spring and repaying in the autumn, and determining the cloth by grain. He earned two ma per piece of cloth through his handling. The masses reflected that "Li Chenggong carries a guillotine, purely killing people." After the establishment of the credit cooperative, the peasants could borrow grain from the credit cooperative, and Li Chenggong could no longer lend at high interest rates. As the business of the credit cooperative expanded, usury decreased. Usury could not exist in this village, so it ran to other villages. As the credit cooperative expanded to other villages, usury ran into the town. Chen Zhongyuan, who lent at high interest rates, lent more than ten dan of grain in the town. Later, no one borrowed it, so he had to deposit the grain into the credit cooperative. Now the black market for usury has been forced to drop from ten percent interest to five or six percent, and its interest rate tends to be in line with the interest rate of the credit cooperative.
    There are five experiences for the development and growth of credit cooperatives and the achievements they have made: The first is that "villages look at villages, households look at households, and the masses look at village cadres." With good village cadres responsible for carrying out the work of credit cooperatives, the peasants see that there are benefits in depositing and borrowing money in credit cooperatives, recognize that credit cooperatives really solve problems, and the business of credit cooperatives will expand. Coupled with the attention and leadership of the party and government, the business of credit cooperatives will be consolidated. The second experience is "to have a god of wealth to support you." The peasants compare the People's Bank to the "god of wealth." The People's Bank strengthens its leadership over credit cooperatives in business and provides appropriate support in terms of funds, which increases the prestige of the credit cooperatives. The credit cooperatives and bank business offices in Pingyao County generally have transfer deposit and loan contracts. The third experience is "to let all members be masters of their own affairs," that is, to implement democratic management. The members' representative meeting must be sound, the members' representatives must play a good bridging role, and the board of directors and supervisors must carefully plan and check their work, and report their work to the members' representative meeting and the members' meeting. The fourth experience is "credit cooperatives should set up credit groups so that peasants can handle affairs without leaving the village." Because a joint village cooperative is linked to many villages, some villages are far away from the joint village cooperative, and it is very inconvenient for the masses of peasants to deposit money in the cooperative. Therefore, credit cooperatives should set up credit groups in the village to handle deposit and loan business on behalf of the credit groups, saving the peasants a lot of trouble and enabling them to handle affairs without leaving the village. If the business of the credit group develops, it can independently establish a credit cooperative. The fifth experience is "brother cooperatives should support each other." The conditions of each cooperative are different, and the development of business is unbalanced. Some have more deposits and fewer loans, while others have fewer deposits and more loans. If the peasants cannot get loans when they need money, or cannot deposit money when they want to deposit it, they will say that the credit cooperative is useless. However, the deposited money or grain must find a way out. Therefore, it is very necessary for brother cooperatives to support each other, which can also reduce some of the burden on the national bank. The credit cooperatives in Pingyao County have already signed and are fulfilling "brother cooperative business contact contracts."
    With the development of agricultural production cooperatives, credit cooperatives are becoming increasingly important, and they will become the center of rural credit lending. The party and government in Pingyao County attach great importance to credit cooperatives. In June of this year, the secretary of the Pingyao County Committee of the Communist Party of China personally convened a symposium of credit cooperative directors and put forward the guidelines for credit cooperatives: vigorously absorb idle funds, support cooperative production, crack down on usury, and ensure that peasants do not go bankrupt. The credit cooperatives in Pingyao County will continue to develop and grow and play their glorious role.

    农民的“小银行”
    ——记山西省平遥县的信用合作社
    萧孔
    山西省平遥县到今年十月份止，成立了十八个信用合作社，共有股金一亿五千多万元，吸收存粮四十九万六千斤，存款二亿六千万元，积累了公积金二千六百七十四万元。这十八个信用合作社联系了一百五十八个村（几占全县半数村庄）。到今年年底，平遥县准备发展到二十五个信用合作社，可以联系二百一十个村。这样，全县百分之六十的地区，就有了有组织有领导的农村信用活动，高利贷的活动范围就会被大大缩小了。
    平遥县的信用合作社是接受了“插柳枝”和“遍地开花”的教训，稳步地建立和发展起来的。所谓“插柳枝”，就是上级布置任务，下级为了“完成任务”，不管当地经济条件和群众要求如何，硬办信用合作社，像“插柳枝”一样的硬插下去。有的碰对了，就能生根发芽成长壮大，有的不能生根，干部一走，就垮台了。为了要“遍地开花”，有的县曾提出过“每户入一股”的口号，结果发生了变相强迫农民入股或存款的现象。这样就把好事办坏了，并且给发展信用合作社造成困难。平遥县接受这些教训，在建立信用合作社时，号召干部首先把经济条件和群众要求调查清楚，然后向群众提出组织信用合作社的办法，帮助群众自觉的组织起来，这样，信用合作社的基础就稳固了。
    信用合作社组织起来以后，县的领导方面很注意建立社内的民主制度，并且加强了人民银行对信用合作社的政策领导，以岳璧社为例：社员大会通过了章程，选出社员代表二十五人、理事九人、监事五人，并且都规定了会议制度，除了耕种和收获等农忙季节以外，一般都能按时开会。信用合作社的贷款计划是由社员代表大会讨论通过，然后交人民银行批准的。三个半脱离生产的干部的待遇也是社员代表大会讨论规定的。理、监事按时总结和计划工作，向人民银行送业务表报，向代表大会或社员大会报告工作，年终向社员大会公布决算。信用合作社存放款有单据，开支有制度，社员有社员证。信用合作社主任定期到人民银行的区营业所汇报工作。县人民银行定期召集信用合作社主任开会，检查、总结和布置工作。
    平遥县的信用合作社的业务，发展得是很快的。以岳璧社为例，以一九五○年为一百，一九五一年股金增加到四七四，存款增加到三八一，放款增加到一九七；一九五二年十月股金增加到一二五六，存款增加到一二一○，放款增加到六九七。
    这里应当说明的是：一九五○年岳璧社只是一个村的社，到一九五二年已发展成十四个村的联村社。该社和三十一个互助组订立了存贷合同，存粮大量增加了。该社还在周围村庄设立了六个信用小组，形成了一个农村信用网，农民存、取、贷、还都很方便。岳璧村的农民说：“真想不到一千七百四十斤粮食的本钱，当时还买不了一头骡子，现在的本钱却能买五百头骡子了。”“信用合作社成了我们的小银行了”。
    信用合作社的经营方式是很灵活的：“实物、货币两方便，存取粮款任你挑”，根据这些信用合作社的经营历史看，开始一般是经营简单的实物存贷业务，逐渐发展到经营实物货币混合业务，现在有些社已经逐渐代理起国家银行储蓄、保险、农贷催收等业务。实物经营的种类也是多种多样的，原来规定经营小米、麦子、棉花三种，现在豆子、高粱、玉茭都经营了。折算方法有：存贷折实（按供销社牌价），存实贷实，存实贷款等。但多数还是以实物计算、货币收付，农民觉得这样“方便”而又“放心”。货币存贷刚刚开始，所占数量很少。信用合作社以经营实物为主有两种原因：一是群众有季节差额的顾虑，一是农村货币缺乏，物资交换多，货币供应不上。
    信用合作社和互助组订立合同，这是开展信用合作社业务的好办法。七月份，东泉、岳璧等五个社和五十四个互助组签订合同，贷款二千五百万元，贷粮八千二百斤，互助组保证将秋收余粮全部存入社内。执行结果，信用合作社扩大了业务，扩充了股金，密切了信用合作社和生产的连系。
    平遥县的信用合作社发挥了那些作用呢？一、在爱国丰产运动中，帮助农民群众购买耕畜二一六头，新农具三八件，修购旧农具一千三百余件，打新井挖旧井六九眼，购肥料一七二万斤，买猪羊三五○只。取得生活贷款的农民有一千多户，取得周转便利的手工业户四百户。二、打击高利贷。以岳璧村为例：今年青黄不接时，有三十多户要卖油菜青苗，解决生活问题，信用合作社拿出六千斤粮食贷给他们，他们不卖青苗了。有个商人叫李成富，他每年用三十余石粮食借给二十余户，春借秋还，以粮定布，每匹布他经手一下赚两码，群众反映说：“李成富扛的是铡刀，净杀人。”信用合作社成立后，农民可以向信用合作社借到粮食，李成富再不能放高利贷了。信用合作社业务扩大，高利贷由多到少。高利贷在本村存在不住，跑到外村，信用合作社扩大到外村，高利贷就跑进城关了。放高利贷的陈中元在城关放了十余石粮，后来没有人借了，他只得把这些粮食存入了信用合作社。现在高利贷黑市被迫由十分利降到五、六分，它的利率有向信用合作社的利息看齐的趋势。
    信用合作社发展壮大和取得成绩的经验有五条：第一条是“村看村，户看户，群众看的是村干部”。有很好的村干部负责开展信用合作社的工作，农民们看见在信用合作社存款和借款有好处，认识了信用合作社真解决问题，信用合作社的业务就展开了。加上党政领导方面的重视和领导，信用合作社的业务就巩固了。第二条经验是“要有财神爷撑腰”。农民们把人民银行比作“财神爷”，人民银行对信用合作社在业务上加强领导，在资金方面给予适当的支持，信用合作社的威信就高了。平遥县的信用合作社和银行营业所现在一般都订有转存转贷合同。第三条经验是“要全体社员当家作主”，也就是实行民主管理。社员代表会要健全，社员代表要很好地起桥梁作用，理、监事会要认真计划工作和检查工作，并且要向社员代表会和社员大会报告工作。第四条经验是“信用合作社要设立信用小组，让农民不出村就能办事。”因为一个联村社联系很多村庄，有些村庄离联村社很远，农民群众到社里去存款很不方便，因此，信用合作社要在村里设立信用小组，由信用小组代办存贷款业务，农民省去许多麻烦，不出村就能办了事。信用小组的业务发展了，就可以单独成立一个信用合作社。第五条经验是“兄弟社要互相支援”。各社所处条件不同，业务发展是不平衡的，有的存多贷少，有的存少贷多。农民需款时若贷不到，存款存粮时要存不进，就会说信用合作社无用处了。但存进的款或粮是要找出路的。因此，兄弟社之间互相支援是很必要的，这也可以减少国家银行的若干负担。平遥县的信用合作社之间已经订立和履行着“兄弟社业务联系合同”。
    随着农业生产合作社的发展，信用合作社越发显得重要了，它将成为农村信用借贷的中心。平遥县党政方面是很重视信用合作社的。今年六月，中共平遥县委员会书记亲自召开信用合作社主任座谈会，并提出信用合作社的方针：大力吸收闲散资金，扶植合作生产，打击高利贷，保证农民不破产。平遥县的信用合作社将继续发展壮大，发挥它光辉的作用。
