    I Escaped the Bitter Sea of a Buying and Selling Marriage

    Editor: I want to report to you with incomparable excitement about my escape from the bitter sea and attainment of marital freedom.

    My name is He Qingzhen, and I am from Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province. I am now twenty-seven years old. My parents died when I was just over a year old, and I depended on my uncles and aunts to survive. When I was thirteen, my ruthless uncle, in order to get more money, insisted on saying I was "fifteen years old" and sold me to Hou Jun as his wife. I remember that on the day I "got married," my heart was burning, and tears kept flowing from my eyes. After that, I fell into a sea of bitterness, living a life of being bullied and beaten. Because I was young and couldn't do needlework well, I was once beaten by my husband until my whole body was red and swollen, and I ran to the wilderness to cry bitterly. My mother-in-law grabbed my hair and dragged me home, threatening me, "If you go outside to cry again, I'll smash your bones." From that time on, I had to swallow my tears. I endured like this for more than ten years. In the spring of 1950 after liberation, a democratic women's federation was established in the village, and I was honorably elected as a representative. Later, a women's literacy class was established in the village, and I was recommended as the head teacher. Under the education and leadership of the Communist Party, I made progress. But my husband started to oppose me: he wouldn't eat the food I cooked; he wouldn't use the water I brought; every time I came home from a meeting, he would lock the door. His abuse of me was even worse than before. Comrades told me to not be afraid of any difficulties and to persuade and educate all backward people. I did it again and again, but my husband continued to beat and scold me. I lived nearly three years of secretly attending meetings and studying. In September of this year, my husband's abuse became even more severe. When he saw me talking to a male comrade, he grabbed my hair and beat me when I got home. I told the township head about this situation, and the township head educated my husband several times, but he remained unrepentant. Having reached the limit of my endurance, I petitioned the People's Government for a divorce. The People's Government has already ruled for my divorce, but my uncle on my mother's side ran over, grabbed my collar, and threatened me: "You can't get divorced! If you get divorced, then we..." I insisted on fighting, and finally got divorced. After the divorce, my ruthless uncle still had designs on me and attempted to sell me off like an object again. But because I have Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's Marriage Law, and because I have already awakened, I will not fall into the bitter sea again. Now I have freely married Zhang Tianyu, who loves to work. After the marriage, our relationship is very good. What we are concerned about is how to make a good production plan and how to make our happy days even happier.

    I deeply know that the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Marriage Law are my life-saving benefactors who pulled me out of the bitter sea. In order to repay Chairman Mao, I will definitely do my best to publicize the Marriage Law so that those men and women, especially women sisters, who are still in pain can quickly move towards happiness.

    我脱离了买卖婚姻苦海
    编辑同志：我要以无比兴奋的心情向你报告我脱离苦海、得到婚姻自由的经过。
    我叫何清贞，陕西省凤翔县人，现年二十七岁。我在一岁多的时候就死了父母亲，靠叔父母过活。十三岁时，狠心的叔父为了多得钱，硬把我说成“十五岁”卖给侯俊为妻。记得我“结婚”那天，我的心里像火烧一样，眼睛一直流泪。那以后，我便陷入了苦海，过着受气挨打的日子。我因为年纪小，针线活做不好，有一次竟被丈夫打得满身红肿，跑到野外去痛哭。婆婆抓着我的头发把我抓回家，威胁我说：“以后再到外面去哭，就砸碎你的骨头。”从那时起，我的眼泪就只好往肚里咽。我这样地熬过十多个年头。解放后的一九五○年春天，乡里成立民主妇女联合会，我光荣地当选为代表。后来，村里成立妇女识字班，我又被推为班主任。在共产党的教育、领导下，我进步了。但我的丈夫却和我作起对来：我做的饭，他不吃；我端去的水，他不用；我每次开完会回家，他把门锁上。他对我的虐待比以前更厉害了。同志们告诉我，要不怕一切困难，要说服教育一切落后的人。我一次一次地做了，但是丈夫对我继续打骂。我偷偷摸摸地开会、学习的日子过了近三年，今年九月，丈夫对我的虐待更加厉害。他看见我和男同志说句话，回家后就抓住我的头发打我。我把这情况告诉乡长，乡长对我丈夫教育了好几次，但他仍然执迷不悟。忍无可忍，我就向人民政府请求离婚。人民政府已经判决我离婚了，我娘家的叔父却又跑来抓住我的领子威胁我：“你不能离婚！要离了婚，那咱们……”我坚持斗争，终于离婚了。离婚后，狠心的叔父还在我身上打主意，还企图把我当物件出卖。但由于有了毛主席，有了毛主席的婚姻法，也由于我已经觉悟，我不会再一次堕入苦海了。现在我已经和爱好劳动的张天钰自由结婚。结婚后，我们夫妻感情很好，我们所操心的是如何把生产计划订好，如何使幸福的日子过得更幸福。
    我深切知道，使我脱离苦海的救命恩人是共产党、毛主席，是婚姻法。为了报答毛主席，我一定尽力宣传婚姻法，好使那些还在苦痛中的男女，尤其是妇女姐妹，迅速走向幸福。
    何清贞述（孙钰记）
