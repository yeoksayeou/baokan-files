    Must Increase the Speed of Newspaper Delivery
    Comrade Editor: In newspaper distribution work, the Jincheng Post Office in Shanxi Province has significantly increased the number of newspapers distributed in rural areas by increasing the distribution speed of rural mail. In the past, many readers complained to the post office: "The newspaper doesn't come, and when it does, it's six or seven issues at once, and the news becomes old news." Some readers suggested: "If the post office can guarantee on-time delivery, I will subscribe." In order to improve delivery work, the Jincheng Post Office increased the number of rural mail routes and adjusted the postal routes in July of this year. Now all villages in the county can receive newspapers, and even the most remote villages can receive newspapers in just two and a half days. As a result, the circulation of various newspapers has also increased. The circulation of the "Shanxi Peasant's Newspaper" was 4,534 copies in July, and now it is 5,144 copies. The "Shanxi Daily" and "People's Daily", etc. have also seen significant increases. Therefore, we believe that increasing the speed of newspaper delivery is an important experience in expanding newspaper distribution in rural areas.　Song Hao

    必须提高报纸投递的速度
    编辑同志：山西晋城邮局在报纸发行工作上，因为提高了乡邮的发行速度，农村报纸发行数量有了显著的增加。过去不少读者向邮局反映：“报纸不来就不来，一来就是六、七期，新闻变成了旧闻。”有的读者提出：“邮局能保证按时按期送到，我就订阅。”为了改进投递工作，晋城邮局于今年七月增加了乡邮班次，并调整了邮路。现在全县各村均能收到报纸，最远的村庄只要两天半的时间也可以收到报纸。因此，各种报纸的发行量也随着增加了。山西农民报的发行数量在七月份为四千五百三十四份，现在为五千一百四十四份，“山西日报”、
    “人民日报”等也有显著的增加。因此，我们觉得：提高报纸投递速度，是在农村扩大发行报纸的一个重要经验。　松浩
