Due to the U.S. imperialism's deliberate aggression and expansion of the war, dragging out negotiations, and finally even announcing an indefinite adjournment, and the recent unreasonable rejection by the U.S. government of Vyshinsky's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly for "ceasefire first, then repatriation of prisoners," its aim is still to continue burning the flames of war in Korea. The great victories of our Chinese and Korean People's forces over the past two years, especially the recent great victory at Shangganling, have dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. However, U.S. imperialism does not care about the lives of American soldiers and those of its satellite states, nor the burdens of their people, and is still plotting to expand the aggression. Therefore, the Korean War will be prolonged, requiring the Chinese and Korean People's forces to continue their efforts to inflict even heavier blows on the enemy, and requiring our people across the country to continue to intensify the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in order to achieve a final fair and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue.

The anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea movement of the past year has achieved great results. The donation of airplanes and cannons by the people of the motherland has had a significant impact on the front lines. In September 1952, the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea went to Korea to express their appreciation to the Chinese and Korean People's forces, which greatly inspired the Chinese and Korean People's forces who were fighting bravely against the American and Syngman Rhee gangs on the front lines. The Chinese and Korean People's forces were determined to "fight victoriously and make great contributions" in order to strive for a reasonable resolution of the Korean issue, to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, and to respond to the deep affection of the Chinese people. Now, the Second Delegation to Korea has completed its mission and returned to the country, and has gone to various places to disseminate information. The people of all regions must carefully study the demands put forward by the delegation during its dissemination, formulate specific measures, and continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in a guided and planned manner, so that the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is combined with the great construction cause of our motherland, and becomes an important driving force for overcoming difficulties in construction. We believe that the following four items should be the central tasks for continuing to carry out the anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea movement in the future:

	I. Continue to deepen ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea: All localities should use the dissemination by the delegation to widely publicize the great victories and heroic struggles of the Chinese and Korean People's forces on the Korean front lines, who are becoming stronger as they fight; point out the fact that U.S. imperialism has no sincerity for peace and continues to invade and conspire to expand the war; and point out the significance of our people's long-term resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea for our national defense construction, economic construction, and for world peace. Local branches of the China Peace Committee should prepare to conduct another large-scale, universal ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea during next year's Spring Festival movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of military personnel (referred to as supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel) and literary and artistic propaganda activities, using various methods.

	II. Strengthen the patriotic production increase and economy campaign: Every grass-roots production unit and grass-roots residents' organization must regularly and universally check and revise patriotic production increase and economy plans and other patriotic covenants related to public security, health, and culture and education, and call on the people to learn from the Volunteer Army's high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and learn from the Volunteer Army's active and creative spirit in fighting bravely to overcome difficulties, in order to improve production and work efficiency, strengthen national defense construction and economic construction, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

	III. Conscientiously do all work to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of military personnel: During next year's Spring Festival movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of military personnel, local branches of the China Peace Committee should work with relevant organizations to earnestly check the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel. Those who have done well should be commended and promoted, and those who have not done well should be criticized and corrected, and new plans for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel should be made and earnestly supervised and implemented. In the future, the following tasks of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel must be done well: (1) All difficulties in the lives of military families, whether residing in cities or rural areas, must be earnestly helped to be resolved as much as possible; military families who can participate in work should be given care and priority in allocating appropriate work. (2) During the New Year and festivals, and when Volunteer Army commanders and fighters make meritorious contributions on the front lines, local people's governments and the masses should give comfort and congratulations to their families. When celebrating meritorious services, commemorative gifts should be given. (3) For Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers who come to the rear for recuperation, local hospitals and health agencies must earnestly solve their difficulties in medical treatment and recuperation, and provide frequent comfort. (4) The people in all regions should frequently write letters of appreciation to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with specific and vivid content, telling them about the situation and achievements of the motherland's construction in all aspects.

	IV. Conscientiously do a good job in supply and comfort work: To do a good job in supplying and expressing appreciation to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the main tasks are as follows: (1) When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returns to various places in the country to contact various agencies and people's organizations, they must be fully enthusiastic and earnestly help them solve problems; (2) The various canned foods and tools for building fortifications supplied to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army must be carefully and regularly inspected, and those of poor quality must not be supplied to the front; (3) Local theatrical troupes should plan to take turns to go to Korea to conduct one to three months of appreciation performances for the Volunteer Army.

    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示
    由于美帝国主义蓄意侵略和扩大战争，拖延谈判，最后竟至宣布无限期休会。最近美国政府又无理地拒绝了维辛斯基在联合国大会上提出的“先停火、后遣俘”之建议。其目的仍在继续将战火在朝鲜燃烧下去。我中、朝人民部队两年来的伟大胜利，尤其是最近上甘岭的大捷，给予美帝国主义的打击是沉重的，但美帝国主义并不把美国及其仆从国家士兵的生命和人民的负担放在心上，还在阴谋扩大侵略。因之，朝鲜战争还要拖延，还要中、朝人民部队再接再厉给敌人以更沉重的打击，还要我全国人民继续加紧抗美援朝的斗争，以求朝鲜问题的最后的公平合理的解决。
    过去一年的抗美援朝运动是有伟大成绩的。祖国人民的捐献飞机大炮运动，已在前方发生了重大的影响。一九五二年九月，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团前去朝鲜慰问中、朝人民部队，又对正在前线与美李匪帮英勇奋战的中、朝人民部队以莫大的鼓舞。中、朝人民部队都纷纷下决心以“打胜仗、立大功”，来争取朝鲜问题的合理解决，以维护远东和世界的和平，并回答中国人民的深情厚意。现在第二届赴朝慰问团已经完成任务回国，且已分赴各地进行传达。各地人民必须认真研究慰问团在传达时提出的要求，订出具体办法，有领导地有计划地继续加强抗美援朝工作，使抗美援朝工作和我们祖国的伟大建设事业互相结合，并成为建设中克服困难的一个重要动力。我们认为，以下四项应当是今后继续展开抗美援朝运动的中心任务：
    一、继续深入抗美援朝思想教育：各地应当利用慰问团的传达，向人民扩大宣传朝鲜前线中朝人民部队的伟大胜利，英勇奋斗，愈战愈强；指明美帝国主义毫无和平诚意，继续侵略和阴谋扩大战争的事实；指明我国人民长期抗美援朝对于我国国防建设、经济建设的意义和对于世界和平的意义。各地抗美援朝分会应准备在明年春节的拥护军队优待军属（简称拥军优属）运动和文艺宣传运动中，利用各种方式，再进行一次大规模的普遍的抗美援朝思想教育。
    二、加强爱国增产节约运动：各个基层生产单位和基层居民组织，必须经常地、普遍地检查和修订爱国增产节约计划和其他有关治安、卫生、文教的爱国公约，号召人民群众学习志愿军高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，学习志愿军英勇奋斗克服困难的积极性和创造性，以提高生产和工作效率，加强国防建设和经济建设，以支援中国人民志愿军。
    三、认真做好一切拥军优属工作：在明年春节的拥军优属运动中，各地抗美援朝分会应会同有关组织切实检查拥军优属工作，做得好的表扬推广，不好的批评纠正，并订出新的拥军优属计划，认真地督促执行。今后必须做好以下几项拥军优属工作：（1）无论居住在城市和农村的军属，其生活上的一切困难必须尽一切可能切实帮助解决；能参加工作的军属，应予以照顾，优先分配适当工作。（2）过年过节和志愿军指战员在前方立功的时候，当地人民政府和群众应向其家属进行慰劳和祝贺。庆功贺喜时，应送具有纪念意义的慰问品。（3）来后方休养的志愿军伤病员，各地医院和卫生机关，必须切实解决他们在医疗和休养上的困难，并经常地进行慰问。（4）各地人民群众，要经常地给中国人民志愿军写有具体生动内容的慰问信，告诉他们
    祖国在各方面建设的情况和成就。
    四、切实做好供应和慰问工作：做好供应和慰问中国人民志愿军的工作，主要有下列几项：（1）中国人民志愿军回到国内各地，向各机关和人民团体接洽事情时，必须充分热情地认真地帮助他们解决问题；（2）供应中国人民志愿军的各种食品罐头和修筑工事的用具等，必须注意加以认真的、经常的检查，质量不好的不准供应前方；（3）各地剧团应有计划地轮流到朝鲜为志愿军进行一个月至三个月的慰问演出。
    一九五二年十二月二十二日
