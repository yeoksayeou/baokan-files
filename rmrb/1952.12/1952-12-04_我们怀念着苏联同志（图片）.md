    Sixteen. When I arrived at the ward, I learned that the person on the road was Comrade Dalasov, who was also there to visit Old Liu. The patient was moved to tears when he saw Comrade Dalasov, this friend with a high degree of internationalism and class feeling. At this time, my eyes were also filled with tears of emotion.
    Seventeen. The next day, Comrade Dalasov seriously criticized my bureaucratic approach to leadership, and my lack of attention to the health of the workers, which prevented us from increasing production efficiency even further. Comrade Dalasov gave me great enlightenment on the issue of caring for the lives of the masses.
    Eighteen. One day, Comrade Dalasov and I went to the factory to inspect the work. At this time, the workers were eating lunch. A worker opened his locker and took out a steamed bun. We saw clothes, shoes, and steamed buns placed together in the locker. Comrade Dalasov said, "Look, with shoes and food placed together like this, how can they not get sick!"

    十八、某天、我和达拉索夫同志到厂里去检查工作，这时工友们正在吃午饭。一个工友开了衣服柜拿出馒头来，我们看见柜子里的衣服、鞋子和馒头放在一起。达拉索夫同志说“你瞧，这样鞋子和食物放在一起，还能不生病吗！”
