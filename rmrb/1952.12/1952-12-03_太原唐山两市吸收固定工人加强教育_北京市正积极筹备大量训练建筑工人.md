    Taiyuan and Tangshan Strengthen Education by Absorbing Permanent Workers
    Beijing Actively Prepares to Train Large Numbers of Construction Workers
    The construction departments in Taiyuan and Tangshan have made preliminary achievements in absorbing temporary workers as permanent workers. According to statistics from eight units in Taiyuan, by the end of October, various construction departments had fixed 7,079 long-term workers and signed seasonal contracts with 4,136 workers.
    Before starting this work, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau formulated a "Draft of Unified Technical Standards for Construction Workers in 1953," and clearly stipulated the working hours, holidays, accommodation and other benefits for long-term workers, seasonal workers and temporary workers. In carrying out this work, each unit established organizations to fix workers and carried out publicity and education work. Taiyuan Engineering Company held four cadre meetings to mobilize, and formed a "Fixed Workers Committee" at the construction site to vigorously lead the work of fixing workers.
    After the work of fixing long-term workers began, the majority of construction workers welcomed it, but many workers also had ideological concerns. Some highly skilled workers were afraid of lowering wages after being fixed; some skilled workers from rural areas were afraid of "losing freedom after being fixed." Each unit mobilized propagandists to publicize the future of the country's industrialization and the future of construction workers to the workers. Taiyuan Engineering Company raised questions such as "What are the benefits of fixing workers for the country and individuals?" to organize workers to discuss, which played a great role in resolving workers' ideological concerns. Some units adopted the method of calculating the overall picture, so that construction workers understood that it was beneficial to the country and individuals to be fixed. Taiyuan Real Estate Company gave workers a detailed calculation, making it clear to the workers that although temporary workers earn more money, they have no wages after work stops in winter, so being a long-term worker is beneficial to the country's construction cause and individual interests. Because the Taiyuan Engineering Office conscientiously conducted ideological education for the workers, it absorbed 280 long-term workers from 423 temporary workers in the short five days from October 27 to 31. After fixing 1,500 construction workers, the Third Engineering Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central Government in Taiyuan established a Workers' Winter Training Committee on November 13, mobilized 85 cadres to participate in the training work, and investigated the ideological situation of construction workers, preparing to conduct education based on these ideological situations to improve the political level of fixed workers and consolidate the work of fixing workers.
    Since the beginning of October, Tangshan Construction Company has absorbed 4,611 construction workers as fixed long-term workers. The fixed construction workers began to establish the idea of serving the construction industry for a long time and increased their work enthusiasm. The workers who repaired the roads after being fixed put forward the slogan of "Improve work efficiency and let citizens walk on new roads as soon as possible," which increased the work efficiency of laying cement by nearly two times.
    Another dispatch: In order to meet the basic construction tasks next year, the construction units in Beijing are also actively preparing for the winter training of workers. The participants in the study are mainly long-term workers, as well as technicians, administrative staff, and grass-roots trade union cadres, totaling about 30,000 people. The study time is scheduled for three months. First, political study will be carried out. In addition to the education of communism and the Communist Party, the focus will be on solving the tendencies of neglecting national interests and extreme democratization existing among employees, eliminating the remnants of superstitious, gang, and guild ideas, and establishing the attitude of being masters of labor. Then, various specialized business studies will be carried out according to the nature of the work of different types of work and cadres. In addition, each unit will conduct accelerated literacy education according to its own situation, and create experience in carrying out the literacy campaign among construction workers. Now, under the unified leadership of the Party, each unit, together with the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, has organized a study committee to strengthen the leadership of winter training of employees. The Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering has established an accelerated literacy teacher training class on November 11, absorbing 126 workers with a certain level of education and full-time cultural teachers to study, preparing to carry out literacy work.

    太原唐山两市吸收固定工人加强教育
    北京市正积极筹备大量训练建筑工人
    太原、唐山两市各建筑部门，在吸收临时工为固定工人的工作中，已有了初步成绩。据太原市八个单位的统计，截至十月底，各建筑部门已固定了长期工人七千零七十九人，签订了季节合同的工人也有四千一百三十六人。
    在开始这个工作前，太原市人民政府劳动局制定了“一九五三年建筑工人统一技术标准草案”，并明文规定了长期工人、季节工人、临时工人的工时、假期、住宿等待遇。各单位在进行这一工作中，建立了组织固定工人的机构，开展了宣传教育工作。太原工程公司召开了四次干部会议进行动员，并在工地组成了“固定工人委员会”，大力领导固定工人的工作。
    固定长期工人工作开始后，广大建筑业工人都表示欢迎，但也有很多工人有思想顾虑。有些技术较高的工人怕固定后降低工资；有些从农村来的技术工人，怕“固定了不自由”。各单位发动宣传员向工人宣传祖国工业化的前途和建筑工人的前途。太原市工程公司提出了“固定后对国家对个人有什么好处”等问题组织工人讨论，对于解决工人的思想顾虑作用很大。有的单位采取了算大账的办法，使建筑工人懂得了固定后对国家对个人都是有利的。太原市地产公司详细地给工人算了账，使工人明确了临时工虽然赚钱多，但到冬季停工以后就没有工资了，因之当长期工人对国家的建设事业和个人利益都有好处。太原市工程处由于认真地对工人进行思想教育，所以在十月二十七日至三十一日短短的五天内，在四百二十三名临时工人中，吸收了二百八十名为长期工人。太原市中央第二机械工业部第三工程处在固定了一千五百名建筑工人以后，在十一月十三日成立了工人冬季训练委员会，动员了八十五名干部参加训练工作，并调查了建筑工人的思想情况，准备根据这些思想情况进行教育，以提高固定工人的政治水平，巩固固定工人的工作。
    唐山市建筑公司从十月初开始到现在，已经吸收了四千六百十一名建筑工人为固定长期工人。固定后的建筑工人，开始树立了长期地为建筑事业服务的思想，提高了工作热情。固定后的修建马路的工人提出“提高工作效率，早日让市民走新马路”的口号，把铺洋灰的工作效率提高了将近两倍。
    又讯：北京市各建筑单位，为了迎接明年的基本建设任务，也正积极进行冬季训练工人的筹备工作。各单位参加学习的人员以长期工人为主，并有技术人员、行政管理人员和工会基层干部等，共约三万人。学习时间预定为三个月。首先进行政治学习，内容除进行共产主义和共产党的教育外，着重解决职工中存在的忽视国家利益和极端民主化的倾向，肃清迷信、帮派、行会等思想的残余，树立主人翁的劳动态度。然后分别工种和干部工作的性质，进行各种专门业务学习。此外，各单位将根据自己的情况，进行速成识字法教育，创造在建筑工人中开展扫除文盲运动的经验。现在，各单位在党的统一领导下，和行政、工会、青年团共同组织了学习委员会，加强冬季训练职工的领导。中央建筑工程部直属工程公司，已于十一月十一日成立了速成识字教员训练班，吸收有一定文化水平的工人和专任文化教员一百二十六人学习，准备开展扫除文盲工作。
