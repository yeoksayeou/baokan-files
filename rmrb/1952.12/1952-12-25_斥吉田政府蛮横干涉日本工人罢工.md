    In this strike struggle for wage increases, the Japanese working class has fully demonstrated their heroic and resolute spirit in opposing American and Japanese monopoly capitalists. From September 24th to the present, 120,000 electrical industry workers have held 15 consecutive power outage strikes. The general strike of 270,000 coal miners, which began on October 17th, has also persisted for two months. In terms of duration, this strike is rare in the history of the Japanese labor movement. The broad masses of the Japanese people recognize that the struggle of electrical industry workers and coal miners is closely linked to the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. They united and actively supported the long-term strikes of electrical industry workers and coal miners. Workers belonging to unions such as the state-owned railway, private railway, chemical industry, textile industry, automobile industry, sailors, postal and telecommunications, and government offices have all participated in this struggle for living rights in various ways. Such a long-term and large-scale strike has seriously struck at the Japanese war economy, from which American and Japanese monopoly capitalists have been extracting huge profits, and has also struck at the war preparations policies of the American and Japanese reactionaries. The Yoshida government's Minister of International Trade and Industry admitted that the coal miners' strike alone had caused Japan's coal production to lose more than 5.68 million tons, reducing the production of various coal-consuming factories, most of which are controlled by American and Japanese monopoly capitalists, by 15% to 70%, and reducing railway freight train services by 10%.
    The enormous impact of the Japanese workers' strikes, both politically and economically, has alarmed the American and Japanese reactionaries. At first, they pretended to be calm, attempting to delay and use the threat of starvation to force the long-term striking workers to submit, but they failed in the face of the great unity of the Japanese working class. Therefore, the Yoshida government once again exposed its hideous face and began to take brutal intervention in the strike, using the so-called "emergency arbitration order" stipulated in the newly revised fascist labor law to force the striking coal miners to resume work on December 15. The "reason" given by the reactionary Yoshida government for issuing the "emergency arbitration order" was that the coal miners' strike "seriously affected the national livelihood" and "hindered the normal development of the national economy." People cannot help but ask: Is it not the Yoshida government, which is implementing American war and colonial policies, that seriously affects the improvement of the Japanese people's livelihood and hinders the normal development of the Japanese national economy? Is it not the result of the Yoshida government's implementation of traitorous policies that has led to the decline of Japan's peaceful industry, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed reaching tens of millions, workers being cruelly exploited and unable to make ends meet, the vast rural population living in poverty, and small and medium-sized enterprises collapsing one after another? The fact is very clear that it is precisely because the reactionary Yoshida government's implementation of traitorous policies has seriously affected the lives of the Japanese people and undermined the normal development of the Japanese national economy that Japanese workers cannot but rise up and struggle. The Japanese workers' strike is not "hindering the normal development of the national economy," but seriously striking at the development of the war preparations economy of the American and Japanese reactionaries. The Yoshida government's interference in the coal miners' strike can only further demonstrate that it is an obedient lackey of the American and Japanese monopoly capitalists and an enemy of the Japanese people's struggle to improve their lives and fight for freedom and liberation.
    The reactionary measures of the Yoshida government's barbaric interference in the Japanese workers' strikes will not only fail to ease the serious contradictions between the Japanese people and the American and Japanese monopoly capitalists, but will only make these contradictions more profound and acute. The Yoshida government opposes improving the living conditions of Japanese workers precisely to facilitate the acceleration of the war preparations policy. Recently, the Yoshida government has also proposed a supplementary budget of more than 79.7 billion yen, bringing Japan's total budget for this year to 932.5 billion yen, the largest figure since the war. This huge budget, which is mainly for military spending, cannot but make the Japanese people's tax burden even heavier and make the lives of the Japanese people even worse. The Yoshida government's shameless lies cannot deceive the Japanese people, and the Yoshida government's intimidation and suppression cannot frighten the Japanese people. The Japanese working class and the Japanese people will fight tenaciously for their own living rights and democratic rights.

### 斥吉田政府蛮横干涉日本工人罢工

    斥吉田政府蛮横干涉日本工人罢工
    日本工人阶级在这次要求增加工资的罢工斗争中，充分表现了他们反对美、日独占资本家的英勇和坚决的精神。从九月二十四日到现在，十二万电气产业工人连续举行了十五次停电罢工。从十月十七日开始的二十七万煤矿工人的总罢工，也坚持了两个月。就时间的长久讲，这次罢工是日本劳工运动史上罕见的。广大的日本人民认识到，电气产业工人和煤矿工人的斗争是和日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的斗争密切结合的。他们团结起来积极支持了电气产业工人和煤矿工人的长期罢工。属于国营铁道、私营铁道、化学工业、纺织工业、汽车产业工人、海员、递信和官公厅等工会的工人，都先后以各种方式参加了这一争取生活权利的斗争。这样长期的和大规模的罢工，严重地打击了美、日独占资本家从中攫取巨额利润的日本战争经济，并打击了美、日反动派的备战政策。吉田政府通商产业相承认：仅煤矿工人的罢工就使日本的煤产量损失五百六十八万余吨，使大部为美、日独占资本家所控制的各种用煤的工厂的生产量减少百分之十五至百分之七十，铁路的货车班次也减少了百分之十。
    日本工人的罢工在政治上和经济上所造成的巨大影响，使美、日反动派恐慌起来了。起初他们伪装镇定，企图拖延时间，用饥饿的威胁迫使长期罢工的工人屈服，但是在日本工人阶级的伟大团结的面前，他们失败了。于是吉田政府就再次暴露它的狰狞面孔，对罢工开始采取粗暴的干涉，利用新修改的法西斯劳工法中规定的所谓
    “紧急调处令”，于十二月十五日强迫罢工的煤矿工人复工。吉田反动政府发布“紧急调处令”的“理由”是，煤矿工人的罢工“严重地影响了国民生活”，“阻碍了国民经济的正常发展”。人们不禁要问：严重地影响了日本国民生活改善的，阻碍了日本国民经济正常发展的，难道不正是执行美国战争政策和殖民政策的吉田政府吗？使日本和平工业萎靡不振，失业者和半失业者数达千万，工人受到残酷剥削而不得温饱，广大农村民不聊生，中小企业纷纷倒闭的，难道不正是吉田政府执行卖国政策的结果吗？事实很明显，正因为吉田反动政府执行卖国政策严重影响了日本人民的生活，破坏了日本国民经济的正常发展，日本工人才不能不起来进行斗争。日本工人罢工并不是“阻碍了国民经济的正常发展”，而是严重打击了美、日反动派备战经济的发展。吉田政府干涉煤矿工人的罢工，只能再次说明它是美、日独占资本家的百依百顺的奴才，是日本人民争取改善生活和争取自由解放的敌人。
    吉田政府野蛮干涉日本工人罢工的反动措施，不但丝毫不能和缓日本人民和美、日独占资本家之间的严重矛盾，而只会使这一矛盾更加深刻化和尖锐化。吉田政府反对改善日本工人的生活条件，正是为了便于加紧推行备战政策。最近吉田政府又提出七百九十七亿多日圆的补充预算，而使日本本年度总预算达到九千三百二十五亿日圆的战后最大数字。这种以军费为主的庞大预算，不能不使日本人民的赋税负担更加沉重，使日本人民的生活更加恶化。吉田政府的无耻谎言是骗不了日本人民的，吉田政府的恫吓和镇压是吓不倒日本人民的。日本工人阶级和日本人民将为争取自己的生活权利和民主权利而顽强斗争。
