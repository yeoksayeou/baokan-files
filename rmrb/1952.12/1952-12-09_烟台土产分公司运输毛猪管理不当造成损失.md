    Yantai Native Produce Branch's Improper Management of Live Pig Transportation Causes Losses
    Editor: The Yantai Native Produce Branch of Shandong Province shipped 1,499 live pigs to Shanghai on September 30th aboard the Dajiang vessel, which was carrying coal. During the journey, 291 pigs died, a mortality rate of over 19.4%. These pigs were placed on the coal pile on the deck, without isolation or tarpaulins. They were also loaded too tightly, making feeding and watering inconvenient. As a result, 291 pigs drowned, starved, or died of disease during the long voyage. The main reason for this loss is that the company's storage and transportation personnel did not inspect the transportation means before loading, and neglected the protection of the pigs during transportation, resulting in a serious loss of national wealth. The leading cadres and storage and transportation personnel of the company should review and correct this error.

    烟台土产分公司运输毛猪管理不当造成损失
    编辑同志：山东省烟台土产分公司于九月三十日搭乘装载煤炭的大江轮由烟台装运毛猪一千四百九十九只往上海，途中死亡二九一只，死亡率达百分之一九点四强。这批毛猪放在甲板的煤炭堆上，没有隔离，也没有搭盖棚布，且装载过于拥挤，饲食喂水都不方便，因此在长途的航行中，淹死、饿死、病死毛猪二百九十一只。造成这一损失的原因，主要是该公司储运工作人员在装运前对运输工具既不加检查，运输途中又忽视对猪只的保护，因而造成国家财富的严重损失。该公司领导干部和储运工作人员应检讨纠正这种错误。
