Taking effective steps to strengthen the work of handling people's letters and receiving the masses
Many facts since the "Three-Anti" movement, especially the "Zhang Shunyou incident," have proven that handling people's letters and receiving the masses is an extremely important task in the struggle against bureaucracy. Strengthening this work can not only enable leading organs to promptly discover and eliminate various illegal and undisciplined behaviors and bureaucratic elements, but also enable leading organs to discover major policy issues and main problems in the work, thereby promoting overall work.

The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a special meeting to examine and discuss this work, summarize experience, study improvement methods, and issue formal instructions, stipulating working methods and a series of measures, all of which are completely necessary and correct. Other regions also need to take certain steps to strengthen this work. It would be completely wrong for anyone to think this is making a mountain out of a molehill.

So far, although many regions have seriously improved this work, there are still many regions that continue to treat this work with a bureaucratic attitude. The situation of certain organs in the Hainan Administrative Region published in this newspaper today is a clear example. These organs not only did not handle the people's letters in a timely and responsible manner, but some even investigated those who wrote letters to expose their shortcomings and mistakes as if they were pursuing criminals, and implemented shameful threats, retaliation, and attacks on the informants. If the leading organs in these regions do not want to detach themselves from the masses and suffer failures in their work, but are willing to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and truly do a good job, they must follow the State Council's "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses" and refer to the practices of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to quickly improve this work.

Every revolutionary cadre must conscientiously study the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," thoroughly criticize and correct the wrong attitude towards people's letters and criticism and self-criticism. Only in this way can the strengthening and improvement of this work not become formalistic or technical, but can truly promote the work.

    采取有效的步骤加强处理人民
    来信和接见人民群众的工作
    “三反”运动特别是“张顺有事件”以来的许多事实已经证明：处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作，是反官僚主义斗争中的一项极其重要的工作。这一工作的加强，不但可以使领导机关及时发现与肃清种种违法乱纪行为和官僚主义分子，并且可以使领导机关发现重大的政策问题和工作中的主要问题，从而推进全盘工作。
    中共中央华北局召开专门会议来检查讨论此项工作，总结经验，研究改进办法，发布正式指示，规定工作的方法等一系列的措施，都是完全必要的，正确的。其他地区，也同样有必要采取一定的步骤来加强此项工作。如果谁认为这是小题大做，那就是完全错误的。
    至今为止，虽然有许多地区已经认真改进了此项工作；但是仍然有不少地区继续以官僚主义态度对待这一工作。今天本报发表的海南行政区某些机关的情形，就是明显的例证。这些机关不但没有及时地负责地处理人民来信，有的竟像追查罪犯一样去追查写信揭发自己缺点和错误的人，对揭发者实行可耻的威胁、报复与打击。这些地区的领导机关如果不愿使自己脱离群众，在工作中遭受失败，而愿意发动群众的积极性，真正把工作做好，就必须按照政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，并参照中共中央华北局的做法，迅速改进这一工作。
    每个革命干部都必须认真学习中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，彻底批判与纠正对待人民来信和对待批评与自我批评的错误态度。这样才不会使这一工作的加强与改进成为形式主义的或技术性的，而能真正推进工作。
