Due to the failure to unify and rationally use power equipment in the Qingdao area, a lot of electricity and manpower have been wasted.

The existing power generation equipment in Qingdao belongs to the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau and the Qingdao Textile Management Bureau. At present, the maximum electricity consumption in the Qingdao area is less than 60% of the total possible output.

The reason why the electricity in the Qingdao area cannot be fully utilized is that the leadership of the two enterprises both suffer from departmentalism, competing with each other for power generation, and failing to unify and rationally use power equipment. According to advanced Soviet experience, each isolated power plant should be operated in parallel (that is, several power plants should be used in a unified manner) to fully utilize the role of each power plant, ensure the safety of regional power supply, and avoid unnecessary investment. However, at present, three or four large generators in Qingdao lack a unified command and dispatching agency, forming a situation where whichever power plant wants to connect to the power grid does so, and whichever wants to disconnect does so.

Because there is no unified and rational dispatching, the power system is in a state of serious chaos, causing a series of power generation and supply accidents. For example, in July of this year, the power plant of the state-owned Qingdao No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which belongs to the Textile Management Bureau, strived to generate more power itself, causing the power of the Sifang Power Plant to become unstable, and the boiler had an accident. In August, when a turbine at the Sifang Power Plant failed, the power plant of the Textile Management Bureau should have increased or maintained the original power output to supply power for factory production, but fearing being "affected," it immediately disconnected, leaving several factories without power for production.

In this situation, not only has a large amount of coal and electricity been wasted, but some production units have not been able to obtain a sufficient power supply. The Sifang Power Plant often operates two 15,000 kW generators, bearing a load of about 20,000 kW. At the same time, on the same power system, the Textile Management Bureau is operating a 4,000 kW and a 2,000 kW generator in parallel. Therefore, about 4,000 tons or more of coal and more than 800,000 kWh of electricity will be wasted this year. In order to reduce line losses, in principle, the Sifang Power Plant should be the central power plant, and the power plant of the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, which belongs to the Textile Management Bureau, should be opened more often when necessary. Because the No. 6 Factory is located in the Cangkou District, using the power from this power plant to supply power to the Cangkou District can save power losses on the nearly 20-mile-long line, and also solve the difficulty of insufficient voltage in the Cangkou area due to the distance from the central power source. However, the several power plants of the Textile Management Bureau have always adopted an egalitarian rotating power generation method, so that the Cangkou area cannot get a sufficient power supply.

Because the power equipment is not rationally used, manpower cannot be fully utilized. The Qingdao Sifang Power Plant currently has 14 technical cadres and 205 technical workers. If the Sifang Power Plant is the central power plant, no additional manpower is required to bear the entire region's power load. The four power plants of the Qingdao Textile Management Bureau have a capacity of 19,500 kW, with 35 technical personnel and 301 technical workers. If these four power plants are used as standby power plants, and manpower is rationally allocated as a whole, a large amount of manpower can be saved. It is estimated that the saved electrical technical cadres and technical workers can be used to equip another 30,000 kW power plant.

The employees have expressed dissatisfaction with this unreasonable phenomenon. The employees of the power plants of the Textile Management Bureau said: The higher-ups only care about cloth and yarn; we are orphans without a mother to care for us. The employees of the Electric Power Bureau said: If this continues, how can we guarantee safety and reduce coal consumption?

    青岛地区电力企业单位
    本位主义作怪严重浪费电力
    青岛地区因未统一合理使用电力设备，浪费了很多电力和人力。
    青岛现有发电设备，分属于青岛电业局、青岛纺织管理分局。目前青岛地区电力最高使用量，尚不足全区可能出力的百分之六十。
    青岛地区电力不能充分发挥的原因，是两个企业的领导方面，都存在本位主义，相互争取发电，未统一合理使用电力设备。各个孤独的发电厂，按苏联先进经验，应并车运行（即几个发电厂统一运用），以充分发挥各发电厂的作用，保证地区供电安全，避免不必要的投资。但是，目前青岛三、四个大型发电机，没有统一指挥的调度机构，形成那个发电所愿向电力系统并车就并了，愿解列（解除了并列运行的关系）就解列了。
    因为没有统一合理的调度，电力系统处于严重的混乱状态，引起了一连串发供电事故。例如，今年七月份，纺织管理分局所属国营青岛第一棉纺织厂发电所，因为争取自己多发电，致使四方发电厂电力不稳，锅炉发生事故。八月份，四方发电厂汽轮机发生故障，纺织管理分局发电所，本应提高或保持原已送出的电力，以供应工厂生产用电，但怕被“波及”，即行解列，使若干工厂没有电力进行生产。
    在这种情况下，不但浪费了大量的煤炭和电度，而且有些生产单位得不到充分的电力供应。四方发电厂经常开两个一万五千瓩的发电机，负荷着二万瓩上下的电力。就在这同一时间内，同一电力系统上，却又并列运行着纺织管理分局的一个四千瓩和一个二千多瓩的发电机。因此，今年约要浪费四千吨以上的煤炭，八十万度以上的电度。为减少线路损失，照理应以四方发电厂为中心发电厂，必要时多开纺织管理分局所属国营青岛第六棉纺织厂发电所。因为六厂位于沧口区，用这一发电所的电力供应沧口区用电，可节约近二十多华里的线路上的电力损失，也解决了沧口地区因离中心电源远，电压不足的困难。可是，纺织管理分局的几个发电所，一直采取了平均主义的轮发方式，使沧口地区不能得到充分的电力供应。
    因为电力设备未合理使用，人力也不能充分发挥。青岛四方发电厂，现有技术干部十四人，技术工人二百零五人。如以四方发电厂为中心发电厂，不需要增加任何人力，便可负荷全地区全部电力。青岛纺织管理分局四个发电所，容量一万九千五百瓩，有技术人员三十五人，技术工人三百零一人。如以这四个发电所为备用发电所，对人力加以全盘合理调配，便可节约大量人力。估计节约出来的电业技术干部和技术工人，可以再配备一个三万瓩的发电厂。
    对这种不合理的现象，职工纷纷表示不满。纺织管理分局发电所的职工们说：上级眼里只有布和纱，咱们是无娘管的孩子。电业局的职工们说：这个样，要咱们保证安全，降低煤耗，还能有个门？
