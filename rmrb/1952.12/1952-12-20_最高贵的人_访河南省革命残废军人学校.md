The Noblest People
    ——Visiting the Henan Provincial School for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers
        Qi Wei
    With boundless respect and affection, and bearing the ardent concern of the military region's leaders and all commanders and fighters, I visited the revolutionary disabled soldiers at the Henan Provincial School for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers.

    Here, the revolutionary disabled soldiers have lost arms, legs, or have damaged internal organs. Their physical disabilities have brought them various difficulties in their movements. However, with unparalleled willpower and unbelievable courage and perseverance, they overcome these difficulties, living, learning, and working happily. They share a common thought: they cannot allow the people to support them for the rest of their lives; they must learn skills and continue to serve the people.

    They are full of hope for the future, full of vitality and optimism. During study time, if you enter the classroom, you will see them all studying intently. When it's time for recreational activities, they play ball, play chess, and play cards, and loud, joyful laughter rings out everywhere. Comrades who are blind play the stringed instrument and sing local operas. They are revolutionary optimists. They know that their blood has not been shed in vain. The revolution has been victorious, and the motherland is growing stronger every day. How can they not be happy?

    The studies of these people's heroes are like heroic battles. Even before formal cultural studies have begun, they have already achieved amazing academic results. Comrade Xu Mu was wounded in the head by shrapnel on the battlefield, and his mental capacity is very poor; he often remembers this and forgets that. When he started studying, he only recognized a few words. He handed in a sheet of small characters, and the teacher corrected it fifteen times; he couldn't even solve a simple two times five arithmetic problem. But he did not lose confidence because of this. He thought: "Can't I learn culture just because I have a poor memory? Can't I continue to serve the people? No! As long as I have perseverance and determination, I will eventually learn well." He got up before dawn every day and lit a small kerosene lamp in the classroom to study. During the day, when he was on guard at the gate or looking at vegetables in the fields, he always carried a slate and books, reading and writing as he went. Sometimes, while sweeping the floor, he would suddenly remember a new word or an arithmetic problem and draw it on the ground. Sometimes, he would recite arithmetic formulas in his bed or practice writing on his belly. As a result of this hard work, his cultural level improved day by day, and now he can write simple diaries, articles, and letters home.

    The spirit and achievements of learning like Xu Mu are not isolated. The cultural level of most comrades has improved since they came to the school. The lowest have learned two or three hundred words, and the highest can write fluent articles. Luo Hongbin is a special-grade disabled person; his hands and feet have been amputated, and only a small bit of his thumb and forefinger on his right hand remain. He still uses these remaining fingers to laboriously hold a pen to write. His ideal is: "If I study culture well today, I will at least be able to guard a warehouse for the country in the future." He overcame many difficulties and learned to spell the phonetic alphabet in half a month. Zhao Zhengchang had his right leg amputated, and his right hand was also disabled, so he used his left hand to hold a pen and write. He used to only know ninety words, but after a year of study, he can now write short articles. Zhang De'an and Yang Yutang, who are blind, also insisted on studying culture and attended cultural classes with other comrades. They often asked Zhu Ye, a comrade with a higher cultural level in the class, to read books or newspapers to them. When they read a new word, they immediately asked Zhu Ye to write it on their hands twice, and then they wrote it on the ground. If they wrote it correctly, they would record it in their vocabulary book. In this way, they learned more than 170 new words and more than 40 new terms in a month. They often said: "Don't think that our eyes are disabled; our mouths and brains are not disabled. As long as we can study culture and theory well, we can still do something for the country by doing propaganda work in the future." Inspired by their noble spirit, many comrades have increased their confidence in learning and actively participated in the upsurge of the learning movement.

    The people's army is not only a fighting force, but also a production team. The revolutionary disabled soldiers inherited this glorious tradition and made good achievements in production. The comrades in the school's sanatorium are more severely disabled, at least second-class disabled. In 1951, these two hundred and twenty people produced more than 179,000 catties of grain and vegetables. The pumpkins they grew weighed fifty catties each, and the radishes weighed eight catties each. Many production models and activists have emerged among them, and Chen Fa and Li Shenghua are representatives of them. Chen Fa (a convalescent) is an old Red Army soldier who joined the army in 1931. He went through the 25,000-mile Long March, went through hundreds of battles, and made many contributions to the people. In 1944, when he was the company commander of a certain unit in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, he actively responded to the call and led the entire company to reclaim wasteland. He himself reclaimed 25.5 mu in seventeen days and won the glorious title of "First-Class Labor Hero." After Chen Fa came to the school, although he had serious heart and kidney disease, he still got up before dawn to go to the fields to produce. During the day, except for study time, whenever he had free time, he would run to the fields to weed, fertilize, or sit in the pergola to guard the vegetable garden. He always worked until midnight to water the vegetables (because the waterwheel was borrowed from the villagers, and it was not his turn to water during the day). He often said to everyone: "We are from the working people, and we must not forget labor wherever we go." Li Shenghua, who lost a right leg, often propped himself up on crutches and ran to the vegetable field to hoe and weed, doing all kinds of work. His right leg was only a few inches long. He could not hoe the ground while standing on one leg, so he inserted the remaining leg into the horizontal grid of the crutch and stood to hoe. He hoeed a piece, moved the crutch forward, and then hoeed again. He insisted on doing this for half a day without feeling tired. Once, the company planned to reclaim a piece of land of more than three points to grow vegetables. After hearing about it, he reclaimed the land by himself during his lunch break. When everyone went to reclaim the land in the afternoon, they were shocked.

    In their spare time, they also helped the masses with their work. This year, the comrades in the sanatorium helped the masses harvest 150 mu of wheat. Zhao Yongxiang and Zhao Qinchang, who are blind, and Chen Tianlin and Gao Dongchuan, who are on crutches, also participated in the "harvesting team" and ensured that they would not drop any wheat ears or fall behind. The masses gave them many banners.

    More than 90% of the staff in the school are also revolutionary disabled soldiers. They can all work hard. Wang Zedao, the eighth company commander, is one of them. He was originally a company commander in the Chinese People's Volunteers. After being injured on the battlefield, his legs were amputated, but he did not slack off in his work because of this. He often dragged himself back and forth on the ground with two small crutches, from this class to that class, from the kitchen to the playground, leading work and study. A few comrades had pessimistic and disappointed feelings because they were disabled, but with such a captain leading them, they all gained confidence and courage.

    But they are not complacent or self-satisfied. They all say: "Our contribution to the people is only a drop in the ocean; we still need to study harder in the future and strive to serve the people more." Their noble qualities have made it impossible for me to forget them for a long time after my visit. So many images of "Paul Korchagin," images of the noblest people, are active in my mind, constantly reminding me of how we, healthy revolutionary workers, should strive hard and contribute our greatest strength to the people.

    最高贵的人
    ——访河南省革命残废军人学校
        齐纬
    我怀着无限敬爱的心情，带着军区首长和全体指挥员、战斗员的热切关怀，慰问了河南省革命残废军人学校的革命残废军人同志们。
    这里的革命残废军人同志们，有的缺了胳臂，有的短了腿，有的内脏已经损坏。身体的残废，给他们带来了行动上的各种困难。但他们以无比的坚强意志和难于令人置信的勇气与毅力克服着各种困难，愉快地生活着、学习着和工作着。他们有一个共同的思想：不能让人民养活自己一辈子，要学习本领，继续为人民服务。
    他们充满着对于未来的希望，充满着生命的活力和乐观的情绪。在学习时间，你进入教室，会看到他们个个都在紧张地学习。一到文娱活动时间，就打球、下棋、玩朴克，到处响起嘹亮的欢乐的笑声。双目失明的同志拉着弦子，唱起地方戏。他们是革命的乐观主义者。他们知道自己的血没有白流。革命胜利了，祖国一天天在壮大，他们怎能不高兴呢？
    这些人民功臣们的学习，完全像是英勇的战斗。正规的文化学习还没有开始，他们已经创造出惊人的学习成绩。徐木同志在战场上被炮弹炸伤了头，脑力很差，经常想起这就忘了那。他在开始学习时，只认得很少的几个字，写了一张小字，缴了十五次，教员就给修改了十五次；一道二乘五的算术题就算不出答案来。但他并不因此失去信心。他这样想：“难道记忆力差就不能学文化吗？就不能继续为人民服务吗？不！只要有毅力、有决心，总有学好的一天。”他每天天不亮便爬起来，到课堂上燃起小煤油灯进行学习。白天在大门口站岗或去地里看菜，也总是带着石板、书本，边看边写。有时正在扫着地，忽然想起了生字或算题，便在地上画起来。有时在被窝里还背诵算术口诀或在肚皮上练字。这样刻苦学习的结果，他的文化一天天提高了，现在已经会写简单的日记、稿件和家信了。
    像徐木这种学习的精神和成绩并不是个别的。绝大部分同志在到校以后，文化程度都提高了。最低的也认到二三百个字，高的已能写出通顺的文章来了。罗洪斌是特等残废，手脚都锯掉了，仅右手的大拇指和食指留下了短短的一点，他还用这剩余的手指艰难地挟着笔写字。他的理想是：“今天学好文化，将来至少能够为国家看管仓库。”他战胜了重重困难，半个月学会了拼国音字母。赵正昌的右腿锯了，右手也残废了，他就用左手拿着笔写字。他以前只认识九十个字，经过一年的学习，现在已能写简短的文章了。双目失明的张德安和杨玉堂，也坚持学习文化，和其他同志一起上文化课。他们经常请班内文化程度较高的朱业同志给他们读书或念报。读到生字，便马上让朱业同志在他们手上写两遍，然后他们再在地上写。写对了，再记在生字本上。这样，他俩一个月内学会了一百七十多个生字，还学会四十多个新名词。他们常说：“别看咱们眼残废，嘴和脑子并没有残废，只要能学好文化、理论，将来作宣传工作，也同样能为国家出点力。”在他们这种高尚精神感召下，很多同志都提高了学习的信心，积极地投入了学习运动的热潮。
    人民的军队不仅是战斗队，而且是生产队。革命残废军人同志们继承了这个光荣传统，在生产中做出了良好的成绩。学校教养院的同志们都残废得较重，至少是二等残废。他们二百二十人，在一九五一年生产了十七万九千多斤粮食和蔬菜。他们种的南瓜，大的一个有五十斤重，萝卜一个有八斤重。他们中间涌现出不少的生产模范和积极分子，陈法和李生华就是其中的代表人物。陈法（休养员）是一九三一年入伍的老红军战士，经过两万五千里长征，身经百战，曾为人民立了不少功绩。一九四四年他在陕甘宁边区任某部连长时，积极响应号召，率领全连开荒。他自己一个人在十七天内就开了二十五亩半，获得了“一等劳动英雄”的光荣称号。陈法到校后，虽然心脏病和肾脏病很严重，还是天不明就起来到地里生产。白天除学习时间外，一有空闲，便跑到地里去拔草、施肥，或者坐在凉棚下看守菜园。晚上浇菜（因水车是借用老乡的，白天轮不到浇）总是干到半夜。他常对大家说：“咱们是劳动人民出身，到什么地方也不能把劳动忘掉了。”李生华失去了一条右腿还经常架起双拐跑到菜地里锄地、拔草，什么活都干。他的右腿仅剩下几寸长，用一条腿站着锄不成地，就把残存的腿插到拐子的横格里，站着锄。锄了一片，把拐子向前一挪，再锄。坚持半天也不嫌累。有一次，中队计划开垦一块三分多的地种菜。他听说后，便在睡午觉的时间独自把地开了出来。下午大家去开地时，不禁大吃一惊。
    他们在空暇时还帮助群众工作。今年教养院的同志们帮助群众收了一百五十亩地的麦子。双目失明的赵永祥、赵钦昌以及拄着拐杖的陈天林、高东川等同志也都参加了“助收队”，并保证不掉麦穗不掉队。群众赠给他们不少锦旗。
    学校中百分之九十以上的工作人员，也都是革命残废军人。他们都能埋头苦干。第八中队长王泽道就是其中的一个。他原是中国人民志愿军的一个连长，在战场受伤后锯掉了双腿，但他并没有因此就对工作有任何懈怠。他经常拄着两只小拐在地上拖拉过来，拖拉过去，从这班到那班，从厨房到操场，领导工作和学习。有少数同志因自己残废了，曾发生悲观失望情绪，但有了这样一个队长领导，都增加了信心和勇气。
    但他们并不居功或自满。他们都这样说：“我们对人民的贡献，只不过是大海中的一滴水；今后还需要更加努力学习，争取更多地为人民服务。”他们这种高贵的品质，使我在访问归来以后仍久久不能忘却。多少个“保尔·柯察金”的形象，最高贵的人的形象，活跃在我的脑中，使我不断地想到我们这些身体健康的革命工作者应该如何奋发努力，为人民而贡献自己最大的力量。
