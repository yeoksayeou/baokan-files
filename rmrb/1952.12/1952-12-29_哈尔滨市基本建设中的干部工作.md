    Cadre Work in Basic Construction in Harbin
    Bai Tianming
    Harbin City successfully completed its basic construction tasks this year according to the state plan. This is inseparable from the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's policy of raising basic construction to a primary position, resolutely transferring a large number of cadres from Party and mass organizations, supplementing and strengthening the basic construction force, and gradually shifting the focus of leadership to basic construction.

    Determined to Transfer Cadres to Strengthen Basic Construction Institutions

    Harbin's basic construction tasks this year increased by 70.4 percent compared to last year. Moreover, due to delays in design work, the start of construction was about a month later than usual. At the beginning of construction, the leadership of the basic construction departments was very weak. The number of Party members and Communist Youth League members in the city's basic construction departments was less than 3 percent of the total number of employees, and most of them were concentrated within the offices of the engineering companies and directly affiliated factories. Party organizations had not yet been established at the construction sites. Cadres in all units of the city were busy with the "Three-Anti" campaign, and the Party and Communist Youth League municipal committees had no dedicated institutions to lead basic construction work. The city's construction trade union also had only thirteen cadres, and most of its members were scattered in various districts, without establishing grassroots trade union organizations.

    This situation was extremely inconsistent with the actual requirements. If cadres were not quickly transferred to strengthen the institutions, it would be impossible to strengthen the leadership over basic construction.

    At that time, Li Changqing, secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee, resolutely transferred several leading cadres originally responsible for basic construction work from the "Three-Anti" headquarters, and absorbed responsible cadres from the Party, government, trade union, Communist Youth League, and engineering companies to participate in the work of the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Committee. The Basic Construction Department of the Municipal Committee's Industry Department was also established, with a minister specifically responsible for leading the Party's work in the basic construction departments. At this time, the Songjiang Provincial Committee also instructed the Harbin Municipal Committee to transfer at least one hundred cadres to the basic construction departments. The Municipal Committee resolutely implemented this instruction. Comrade Li Changqing instructed the Municipal Committee's Organization Department: "Give the basic construction departments as many people as they need." In this way, a large number of cadres were quickly transferred to the basic construction departments. The Basic Construction Committee increased from eight cadres to forty-six, and the Basic Construction Department of the Municipal Committee was also fully staffed according to the establishment. The trade union and Communist Youth League also acted quickly. In addition to deciding that the vice chairman would lead the work of the basic construction trade union, the Party Group of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also transferred some outstanding cadres to work in the construction trade union. The number of cadres in the city's construction trade union increased from thirteen to more than sixty. The Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League simultaneously established a Basic Construction Work Committee, led by the secretary and secretary-general of the Municipal Committee. The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League transferred a total of 261 cadres to carry out Party work and mass work in basic construction. It was precisely because so many cadres were transferred that various basic construction organizations could be quickly established and improved. Over the past year, a total of 56 Party branches, 8 Party general branches, 1 Party committee, 62 grassroots trade unions, 5 trade union work committees, 69 Communist Youth League branches, and 9 Communist Youth League general branches have been established at various construction sites.

    Correctly Deploying Cadres to Maximize Their Effectiveness

    Most cadres were unfamiliar with basic construction. Therefore, how to place these cadres in the most needed and suitable positions to maximize their effectiveness was a matter that the Party Committee leadership had to consider carefully.

    Because the construction site is the combat unit of basic construction, the first policy adopted by the Municipal Committee in allocating cadres was to focus on the construction site. Among the 261 cadres transferred, 182 were permanently working at the grassroots construction sites. The cadres of the Party and mass organizations who regularly worked at the construction sites accounted for 93 percent of all cadres. The Harbin Municipal Committee pointed out that the construction site is the grassroots leadership unit for construction. It not only leads the construction, but also carries out a series of complex and meticulous organizational work. Therefore, the leadership must go deep into the construction sites, deep into the production process, to understand the situation and create experience. Experience over the past year has proven that focusing on the grassroots, strengthening the grassroots, and strengthening the organizational leadership of the construction sites are important measures for leading basic construction. When determining and implementing the policy of focusing on the construction sites, there was a dispute over the level at which the grassroots trade union organizations should be placed. Some engineering companies regarded the engineering section as the grassroots organization. Their reason was that the engineering section was an independent economic unit, and in order to concentrate leadership and unify steps, they required the trade union to establish a grassroots committee in the engineering section. However, the trade union believed that an engineering section had more than a dozen construction sites, and many of the construction sites had tasks of more than 10,000 square meters, with thousands of workers. Both production and life problems were quite complex; and these construction sites were scattered in various suburbs of the city. If only one engineering section led them, it would inevitably disperse forces and make it impossible to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. This difference of opinion was not resolved until the responsibility system movement was launched. The engineering company also changed its organizational structure, assigning several deputy directors of the engineering section and some stronger cadres to the site to serve as construction site directors or deputy directors.

    The second policy for deploying cadres was to concentrate the use of cadre forces. Harbin's basic construction tasks this year were large in quantity and concentrated. Although the tasks increased by 70.4 percent compared to last year, the number of construction sites decreased from 79 to 54, of which 22 construction sites were over 10,000 square meters, accounting for 84.3 percent of the total tasks. The nature of the projects was extremely important. The success or failure of these construction sites determined whether the city's basic construction tasks could be completed. Based on this situation, the Municipal Committee determined that all cadres transferred from the Party and mass work departments should be mainly assigned to the above-mentioned 22 construction sites. Cadres with higher quality were assigned to important projects, while general leadership was provided for scattered construction sites. Concentrating forces on the main construction sites not only ensured the completion of the main projects, but also improved the capabilities of the cadres and enriched their leadership experience.

    The third policy for deploying cadres was to draw out the main force, delve into key areas, and create experience. Shortly after the start of basic construction projects in Harbin, the Municipal Committee, through the Party Group of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, requested the Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to experiment at the Foreign Language School construction site, and decided that the Director of the Basic Construction Department of the Municipal Committee's Industry Department and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League should experiment at the Industrial University construction site, and the Chairman of the Municipal Construction Trade Union should create experience at the 121 construction site. This method had a great impact on guiding the work of the city.

    Over the past year, thanks to the Municipal Committee's firm and clear implementation of the above-mentioned policies, it not only brought into play the Party's combat effectiveness, but also, through the grassroots Party work cadres, understood the situation, discovered problems, deployed work, inspected work, strengthened specific leadership, launched the responsibility system movement, and promoted advanced work experience. In June and July, less than half of the workers used the advanced work methods of Su Changyou and Xie Wanfu. By the end of September, this had increased to 84 to 95 percent, and Wang Sunci's segmented parallel assembly line method appeared, taking the work of promoting advanced experience a step further.

    Cultivating New Forces is the Best Way to Solve the Cadre Problem

    In addition to equipping the basic construction departments with a large number of cadres, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also constantly paid attention to discovering activists in the work, cultivating new forces, developing Party organizations, and adhering to the learning system to improve the level of cadres. Over the past year, the city has cultivated a total of 558 cadres above the level of Party branch secretary and trade union committee member, and developed 134 Party members, which has created favorable conditions for continuing to strengthen the Party and mass work in basic construction. In the early stage of the work, the Municipal Committee, in view of the weak Party strength at the construction sites, first helped the trade union and Communist Youth League develop their organizations and improve the level of their cadres, and then gradually expanded the strength of the Party. For example, when deploying work in September and October, the Party Group of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions required each grassroots trade union to cultivate three sets of grassroots committee work cadres by the end of October. The Municipal Construction Trade Union also adopted various methods to cultivate cadres. For example, it clarified the intentions of the leadership by deploying work, studied work methods, and improved the work ability of cadres. It adopted the form of centralized office work, spending two to three days a week, one to two hours in their spare time, gathering cadres who did not leave production to study the situation and unify their understanding. Another example was assigning each cadre to regularly help several fixed objects to study politics and business.

    Because the leadership of the Municipal Committee attached importance to the cultivation of new forces and specifically helped the mass organizations to work, the various mass organizations improved their prestige among the masses, and thus the Party organization had a deep mass base.

    哈尔滨市基本建设中的干部工作
    白天明
    哈尔滨市今年的基本建设任务是顺利地按照国家计划完成了。这和中共哈尔滨市委按照把基本建设提高到首要地位的方针，坚决抽调大批党和群众团体的干部、充实与加强基本建设力量、并逐渐把领导重点转向基本建设的措施是分不开的。
    决心抽调干部充实基本建设机构
    今年哈尔滨市的基本建设任务比去年增加了百分之七十点四。并由于设计工作搞晚了，大部分工程开工时间反比常年晚了一个月左右。开工的时候，基本建设部门的领导力量是很薄弱的。全市基本建设部门的党员、团员，不到职工总数的百分之三，而且绝大部分集中在工程公司机关内部及直属工厂中，工地还没有建立党的组织。全市各单位的干部忙于“三反”工作，党和团的市委，均无专门机构领导基本建设工作。市的建筑工会也只有十三名干部，会员大部分散在各区，又没有建立起基层工会的组织。
    这种情况和实际要求极不相称，如不迅速抽调干部充实机构，就不能加强对基本建设的领导。
    当时哈尔滨市委书记李常青，坚决地把原来负责基本建设工作的几个领导干部从“三反”指挥部抽调出来，并吸收党、政府、工会、青年团及工程公司的负责干部参加哈尔滨市基本建设委员会工作。市委工业部又成立了基本建设处，专门由一个部长负责领导基本建设部门的党的工作。这时，松江省委也指示哈尔滨市委至少抽调一百名干部到基本建设部门去工作，市委坚决执行了这一指示。李常青同志嘱咐市委组织部：“基本建设部门需要多少人就调给多少人。”这样，大批干部就迅速地调到基本建设部门里来。基本建设委员会由八名干部增到四十六名，市委基本建设处也按照编制配齐了干部。工会、青年团也迅速行动起来。市总工会党组除决定由副主席领导基本建设工会工作外，并抽出一部分优秀干部到建筑工会去工作，市建筑工会的干部即由十三人增至六十余人。青年团市委同时成立了基本建设工作委员会，由市委书记和秘书长领导。党、工会、青年团总共抽调了二百六十一名干部，作基本建设的党的工作和群众工作。正由于抽调了这样多的干部，基本建设的各种组织才能迅速地建立与健全起来。一年来，各工地共建立了五十六个党支部，八个党总支，一个党委，六十二个基层工会，五个工会工作委员会，六十九个青年团支部和九个团总支。
    正确地配备干部发挥干部工作效能
    大部分干部对基本建设不熟悉，因此如何把这些干部放到最需要而又适合的岗位上去，以发挥他们最大的效能，是党委领导上必须慎重考虑的问题。
    因为工地是基本建设的战斗单位，市委分配干部所采取的第一个方针就是面向工地。在抽调的二百六十一名干部中，固定在基层工地工作的，就有一百八十二名。全市党的和群众团体的干部经常在工地工作的，占全体干部的百分之九十三。哈尔滨市委指出：工地是施工的基层领导单位，它不仅领导施工，而且还要进行一系列复杂而细致的组织工作。因此，领导方面必须深入工地，深入到生产过程里去熟悉情况创造经验。一年来的经验证明：面向基层，充实基层，强化工地的组织领导，是领导基本建设的重要措施。在确定和执行面向工地的方针时，对于工会基层组织究竟放在那一级的问题，是有过争论的。有的工程公司把工程处作为基层组织，他们的理由是：工程处是独立经济单位，为了集中领导，统一步调，要求工会在工程处建立基层委员会。而工会则认为：一个工程处下设十几个工地，不少的工地任务均在一万平方公尺以上，工人上千，无论生产上的或生活上的问题均相当复杂；而这些工地又分散在市郊各地，如果只由一个工程处来领导，势必分散力量，不可能及时发现问题解决问题。这种分歧意见，直到开展责任制运动后才解决了。工程公司也改变组织机构，把几位工程处副处长及一些较强的干部，分配到现场去作工地主任或副主任。
    配备干部的第二个方针是：集中使用干部力量。哈尔滨市今年的基本建设任务是数量大而集中。任务虽较去年增加了百分之七十点四，工地却由七十九个减至五十四个，其中一万平方公尺以上的工地共二十二个，占全部任务的百分之八十四点三，工程性质均极重要。这些工地的工作好坏，决定着全市基本建设任务的能否完成。根据这一情况，市委确定所有抽调的党和群众工作的干部，主要派在上述二十二个工地，其中质量较高的干部，均配备在重要工程上去，对零散工地则作一般的领导。集中力量到主要工地的作法，不仅保证了主要工程的完成，而且提高了干部能力，丰富了领导经验。
    配备干部的第三个方针是：抽出主要力量，深入重点，创造经验。哈尔滨市委在基本建设工程开工不久，即通过市总工会党组要求市总工会副主席在外文专科学校工地试验，决定市委工业部基本建设处处长及青年团市委秘书长在工业大学工地试验，市建筑工会主席在一二一工地创造经验。这种方法对指导全市工作有很大作用。
    一年来，由于市委坚定明确地执行了上述方针，不仅发挥了党的战斗性，而且通过党的基层工作干部，了解情况，发现问题，布置工作，检查工作，加强了具体领导，开展了责任制运动，推广了先进工作经验。六、七两月，工人中使用苏长有、谢万福先进工作法的不足半数，到九月底，则增加到百分之八十四至九十五，而且出现了王孙慈的分段平行流水作业法，把推广先进经验的工作提高一步。
    培养新生力量是解决干部问题的最好方法
    中共哈尔滨市委除了给基本建设部门配备了大批干部之外，还经常注意在工作中发现积极分子，培养新生力量，发展党的组织，以及坚持学习制度，提高干部水平。一年来，全市共培养了支部书记、工会委员以上的干部五百五十八名，发展了一百三十四名党员，这就给继续加强基本建设的党和群众的工作创造了有利条件。在工作初期，市委鉴于工地党的力量薄弱，首先帮助工会、青年团发展组织，提高干部水平，然后逐渐扩大党的力量。如市总工会党组在九、十两月布置工作时，要求每一个基层工会，要在十月底培养三套基层委员会的工作干部。市建筑工会也曾采用各种办法培养干部。例如，通过布置工作讲清领导意图，研究工作办法，提高干部工作能力。采取集中办公的形式，每星期有两天到三天，在业余时间抽出一、二小时，把不脱离生产的干部集中起来，研究情况，统一认识。再如指定每个干部经常地帮助几个固定对象学习政治和业务。
    由于市委领导方面重视新生力量的培养，并具体帮助群众团体工作，使各种群众组织在群众中提高了威信，从而党的组织也就有了深厚的群众基础。
