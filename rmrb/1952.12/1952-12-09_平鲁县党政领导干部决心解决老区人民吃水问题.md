Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column on October 28 published Comrade Li Tingxuan's criticism of us for not caring about the drinking water problem of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. We warmly welcome and sincerely accept this criticism. At the county party committee meeting on the day we saw the newspaper, we started from this issue and made a more comprehensive and profound review of the construction of the old revolutionary base areas.
    Pinglu's Fourth District and other places suffered severely from the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government sent visiting groups here and distributed a large amount of relief supplies, production loans, and grain loans to help the people solve many difficulties in production and life. However, the people in the old revolutionary base areas still have serious difficulties in drinking water, which we need to solve quickly. For example, in the Fourth and Seventh Districts of our county, more than 20 villages have no water to drink; 17 villages have even more difficulty getting water than Xiaoshagou. The masses in these villages drink rainwater in autumn, snow water in winter, and have to carry water from villages five to fifteen miles away in spring and summer. To this end, the Yanbei Special District allocated 60,000 catties of millet to our county this spring for the masses to dig wells; we distributed more than 53,000 catties on July 28, but the problem has not been completely solved.
    Now, we have decided to take solving the drinking water problem of the people in the old revolutionary base areas as the primary issue in the construction of the old revolutionary base areas. Recently, we organized two investigation teams to investigate the water shortage situation and well-digging conditions in various villages in the Fourth and Seventh Districts, and calculated the labor and expenses required for well-digging (the situation in other districts will also be gradually grasped). Within this year, we will convene a meeting of well-digging technicians to study technology and material preparation issues. Then, according to different situations, we will strive to complete this work separately by the end of February next year (the drinking water problem of the masses in other districts will be resolved at the latest by the autumn of next year). According to the division of labor in the county party committee, this work is still the special responsibility of Yang Zhong, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee, and Cheng Fengqi, Deputy County Head; other comrades should of course also pay attention to and care about this work.
    Finally, there is one point in Comrade Li Tingxuan's criticism that does not match the facts, and we would like to explain it here. He mentioned that we had not distributed the well-digging grain by September 11, but in fact we had distributed more than 53,000 catties before July 28. The original plan was to dig 120 wells in 40 villages in the Fourth and Seventh Districts, and so far 108 dry wells and 43 water wells have been completed. Xiaoshagou Village in the Fourth District originally had one water well, which was not enough to drink. This time, more than 1,000 catties of well-digging grain were distributed, with a plan to dig three wells. Now two wells have actually been completed, but one has little water and the other has no water at all, so the drinking water problem has not been solved.

### 平鲁县党政领导干部决心解决老区人民吃水问题

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    平鲁县党政领导干部决心解决老区人民吃水问题
    编辑同志：十月二十八日“读者来信”栏刊登了李廷选同志对我们不关心老区人民吃水问题的批评。我们热烈欢迎并诚恳接受这个批评。在看到报纸那天的县委会议上，我们从这个问题出发，对有关革命老根据地的建设问题作了较全面而深刻的检讨。
    平鲁四区等地在抗日战争中受到日寇惨重的摧残。毛主席和中央人民政府曾派访问团到这里来，并发了大批救济物资和生产贷粮、贷款等，帮助人民解决了生产和生活中的很多困难。但是，老区人民在吃水问题上还有着严重的困难，需要我们很快解决。像本县四、七两个区有二十多个村子没水吃；有十七个村子吃水比小沙沟还困难。这些村子的群众秋天吃雨水，冬天吃雪水，春夏季就必须到村外五里到十五里远的村子担水。为此，雁北专署今春给我县拨来小米六万斤，让群众打井；我们在七月二十八日已发下了五万三千多斤，但问题并没有彻底解决。
    现在，我们决定把解决老区人民吃水问题当作建设革命老根据地的首要问题。我们最近就组织两个调查小组，到四区和七区调查各村缺水情况和打井条件，计算打井时所需人工和经费（其他区的情况也要逐步掌握）。在年内，我们要召集打井技术工人开会，研究技术和备料等问题。然后，根据不同情况，争取在明年二月底分别完成这项工作（其他区群众吃水问题至迟在明年秋天解决）。根据县委的分工，这项工作仍归县委组织部副部长杨仲和副县长程凤岐负专责；其他同志当然也应该重视和关心这项工作。
    最后，李廷选同志的批评中有一点和事实不符，我们在这里说明一下。他谈到在九月十一日我们还没有把打井粮发下去，其实我们在七月二十八日前已发下了五万三千多斤。原计划在四、七两个区的四十个村子中打井一二○眼，目前已完成旱井一○八眼、水井四十三眼。四区小沙沟村原有水井一眼，水不够吃。这次发下打井粮一千多斤，计划打井三眼。现在实完成两眼，但一眼水不多，一眼根本没水，所以吃水问题还没有解决。前任中共平鲁县委书记　贺光文现任中共平鲁县委书记　王金贵平鲁县副县长　程凤岐中共平鲁县委组织部副部长　杨仲
