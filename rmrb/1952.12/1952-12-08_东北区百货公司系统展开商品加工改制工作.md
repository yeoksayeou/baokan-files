    Northeast Region Department Store System Launches Commodity Processing and Modification Work
    Since the launch of the industrial product promotion campaign, sales staff in the state-owned department store system of the Northeast region have actively studied the performance of commodities, processing, modifying, or re-fitting many long-stocked commodities, or promoting substitutes to turn them into fast-selling goods. The state-owned Changchun Department Store made cotton quilts from stockpiled printed cloth and cotton, which were very popular with customers. State-owned department stores in Jilin, Fushun, and other places made children's clothes, cadre uniforms, and cushions from some slow-selling fabrics, increasing sales threefold. Originally a commodity sold in the summer, linen was used by the Tianjin Street branch of the state-owned Dalian Department Store to make mosquito net backing, selling all 6,000 meters of stockpiled linen in the autumn and winter seasons, greatly reducing capital backlog.
    Based on the above experience, the Northeast Region Company of the State-owned China Department Store recently issued a special call to all sales staff to study commodities and carry out processing, modification, and re-fitting work to increase the variety of goods and expand sales channels.

    东北区百货公司系统展开商品加工改制工作
    东北全区国营百货公司系统的营业员自开展工业品推销运动以来，积极研究商品性能，把很多库存很久的商品加工、改制、改装或是提倡代用使其变成畅销货。国营长春市百货公司把库存的花布和棉花做成棉被，大受顾客欢迎。国营吉林、抚顺等地百货公司把一些不好卖的布料做成小孩衣服、干部制服、垫子等，卖货量增加了三倍。冷布原来是行销于夏季的商品，但是国营大连百货公司天津街门市部用冷布做棉胎网，便在秋冬两季全部销出六千米库存冷布，大大减少了资金的积压。
    根据上述经验，国营中国百货公司东北区公司最近特号召全体营业员研究商品，进行加工、改制、改装等工作，增加商品品种，扩大销路。
