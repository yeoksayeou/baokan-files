    Unveiling the Mystery of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Writing
    ——A Record of the Creation of Changqing's Writing Teaching Method
    Wu Ming
    Since the large-scale cultural learning movement was launched in the People's Liberation Army, the creativity in teaching has truly been like "a hundred flowers blooming"! The recently emerged "Changqing Writing Teaching Method" is another relatively brilliant flower among these "hundred flowers." The creator of this flower, Comrade Changqing, is an enthusiastic and vibrant Youth League member. Under the cultivation of the Party and the Youth League, under the leadership of his superiors, and inspired by the exemplary deeds of comrades like Qi Jianhua and Gao Yubao, he earnestly studied and analyzed the rules of writing for workers, peasants, and soldiers after they had initially become literate, and created a new "writing teaching method." Practice has proven that this method is effective. It meets the needs of the broad masses of commanders and fighters in the army, and points out a shortcut for them in writing.
    After the completion of the army's accelerated literacy teaching, the broad masses of commanders and combatants began large amounts of writing activities, but when they held a pen in their right hand, they would take a handkerchief in their left hand, and wipe away sweat after not even writing a sentence. Ma Tianxiang, a veteran of the Red Army, although he could read general documents, could not write an article of three hundred characters. He asked Changqing to teach him to write a diary every day in order to practice writing. Captain Chen Wanshi, the leader of a team in the Second Advanced Infantry School of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, which was the best team in the entire school, was asked by others to write some experience to be published in the school newspaper so that everyone could learn from it; but he said that this was more difficult than doing a good job, and he had to ask Changqing to write it for him, and he would copy it. Many comrades, after having a certain level of education, wanted to use a pen to write down some of the thoughts in their hearts, but they dared not write, could not write, so they went to ask Changqing what "secrets" there were to writing. Changqing answered them one by one. From here, Changqing began to realize: "This is a common and urgent demand of the masses, and we should think of ways to solve it!" Thus, a desire arose in his mind: How great it would be if there were a method, like accelerated literacy, to solve the problem of writing….
    At a forum, fifty-seven people handed Changqing slips of paper, all saying that writing was a headache. One student said:
    "Once, the instructor asked me to write about 'visiting the life of a certain barracks.' I said: We live in this barracks, what else is there to visit? He said: This is a composition! Write it, use more nouns to make it exciting!" Some students said: "As soon as I thought about writing, the teacher would ask: What style do you plan to use? Is it an expository essay or a narrative essay? After writing a few sentences, the teacher would say to us: Grasp the central idea! Don't repeat and ramble... In this way, we are afraid of writing!" Some said: "What we have in our hearts, they don't let us write, they want us to be like children, forcing us to follow others."
    Such problems made Changqing's head ache. He went to study with other teachers. Someone told him: Writing is just a headache, they are afraid at first, but with enough work, it will naturally be done, it will slowly get better! "Is writing just supposed to make people afraid, just supposed to give people a headache?" Changqing began to doubt. "As long as you're not afraid, won't you not have a headache? That's right, that's it!" But he didn't dare to tell anyone about this bold plan.
    At this time, the leaders of the Second Advanced Infantry School where Changqing was located also began to pay attention to this issue. Li Shizhao, the Deputy Political Commissar of the First Battalion of the school, asked Changqing to study the previous summary reports on language teaching to find a way to solve this problem. Changqing spent three days summarizing the problems raised in the seventy-one summary reports, and there were a total of one hundred and ten items. This left Changqing at a loss. Deputy Political Commissar Li smiled when he saw it and told him: "Study these experiences carefully again, and keep the successful experiences." Changqing followed this instruction and retained several principles such as "concentrated attack on typos" and "linking with reality." But he doubted these experiences and drew two hundred pieces of student work to compare and study. He found that articles that wrote about themselves, or about things they were familiar with and felt deeply about, were written very well. He thought there must be a "secret" to it. He began to think: "The students have good articles in their stomachs, the question is how to bring them out." He told Deputy Political Commissar Li what he had discovered, and Deputy Political Commissar Li felt that this was very reasonable, hoped that he would continue to think about it, and instructed him to conduct further research.
    Then, Changqing investigated the learning situation of more than one hundred students (including regimental-level cadres, soldiers, and even service personnel; there were old soldiers who had gone through the Long March, and young people who were eighteen or nineteen years old). He humbly listened to their opinions and calmly observed and analyzed the various issues raised by the comrades.
    One day, a cook wrote a clapper rhyme for the wall newspaper, and everyone said it was very good. Changqing was also moved after reading this article. He immediately went to find the cook to understand his "creative process." The cook was cutting vegetables there. When he saw Changqing coming, he was extremely happy. He put down the kitchen knife and said:
    "The process of writing this clapper rhyme was very simple. The night before, I mumbled about the things written in the clapper rhyme to my class, and everyone said it was good, and I wrote it out the next day."
    "Can you write well after mumbling it once? Why is that?"
    "Why, you think about it! The things are all ready-made, saying it once is just gathering things together…."
    "Oh! That makes sense." Changqing discovered the benefits of "speaking the text" from this cook. He found a bugler to experiment with. This bugler was most afraid of writing articles, but Changqing didn't tell him to write an article, but first talked to him about his life. The bugler talked about the most unforgettable thing in his life, and Changqing asked him to write it down. The bugler asked, "Is that okay?" Changqing said, "Write it as you say it, it'll definitely work." The bugler was very enthusiastic when he heard this, and wrote it out during his lunch break. When he brought the article to Changqing, his eyes were still red. Changqing knew that he had written it while crying, tears and ink flowing together. How vividly the article was written! Changqing's eyes also became wet as he read.
    Through in-depth investigation and research, Changqing had a general understanding of the rules of writing for workers, peasants, and soldiers: first of all, to eliminate the "ten fears" and break through the "three barriers"; to start with writing about oneself—"I write about myself"; to "speak the text" before writing… He told his opinions to Deputy Political Commissar Li, who carefully considered them and said: "You need to have a small group to experiment!"
    Changqing found four comrades and organized them into a study group. He used nap time to experiment with them. Changqing called this experimental group the "Unveiling the Mystery of Writing" group.
    One of the four was a quartermaster, who had long recognized two thousand characters, but could only use five hundred characters when writing. He had been writing a diary for two years, and every day it was just radishes, cabbage, and green onions. He asked the quartermaster why he wrote such a diary. The quartermaster said: "Someone told me a long time ago that writing a diary for a long time can exercise writing ability, but I have written it this way for two years, and there is only one experience - it doesn't matter whether you write it or not." After speaking, both of them laughed. Changqing asked him to "speak the text" first, and then start writing. As a result, in less than three hours, he wrote an article of nearly a thousand words, with very profound and specific content, with flesh and blood. Changqing was inspired by this quartermaster: workers, peasants, and soldiers have the ability to write.
    However, things did not develop entirely according to Changqing's wishes, and he encountered many troubles, but he did not lose heart. Two students threw down their pens and stopped writing. When asked why, they didn't say anything. Finally, Changqing discovered that they had a feeling of self-doubt, fearing that their local language would make a fool of themselves in the article. After research, he affirmed that they must write in their own words to write well.
    The results of the experiment were better than expected, and Changqing was excited by their articles and a little impatient. Deputy Political Commissar Li told him to be more comprehensive and not to be blinded by individual phenomena. Changqing repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and studied Gao Yubao's writing experience. He attached great importance to Gao Yubao's method of marking the characters he couldn't write with a mark to replace them when writing, because he found that many people were often "stuck" by a word or phrase when writing, interrupting their "thoughts," and they could not continue writing. Therefore, he proposed that they must "jump over obstacles and patch up loopholes." In order to study the language of workers, peasants, and soldiers, he also specifically studied Comrade Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" and Chairman Mao's "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing."
    After nearly a month of investigation, research, thinking, observation, experiment and summary, he wrote a preliminary opinion on the new writing teaching method with a very cautious attitude. The school leaders believed that his experience was good, and decided to set up an experimental class and asked Changqing to continue the experiment.
    When Changqing recalled this period of work, he said: "I deeply felt the care and cultivation of our Party and superiors for a comrade." The secretary of the Party branch often talked to him and encouraged him. Many comrades actively introduced materials and books to him to help him conduct research. Late at night, when Changqing was writing at his desk, the orderly secretly brought him boiling water and quietly left; on rainy and cool nights, comrades in the same dormitory gave Changqing their coats and blankets to put on, and Changqing said: "They all knew clearly what I was doing!" All this made Changqing even more conscientious. He often couldn't sleep well at night because he was thinking about problems. In order to avoid affecting his comrades' sleep, he often put the notebook on his belly and wrote in the dark, or wrote under the street lights.
    After the "August 1st" Army Day this year, the "Writing Teaching Method" experimental class was established. Changqing said: "How excited and happy I am! I want to shoulder this heavy burden."
    There were forty-three students in the experimental class, all with a junior primary school level. As soon as Changqing mobilized them, the students were overjoyed and said, "The door to writing has been opened wide for us!" Everyone began writing. Some comrades drafted more than a dozen topics at once, preparing to "speak the text" and write; some comrades wrote more than two thousand eight hundred words in one breath, and others asked him to rest, but he still wrote "to be continued" at the end.
    At this time, although Changqing clearly recognized the key points of writing for workers, peasants, and soldiers, he was not very clear about the specific implementation steps. When Changqing talked about his first experiment, he said: "At that time, every step was difficult, but it was so fascinating!" The students' writing enthusiasm was like a torrent, unstoppable, and they wrote many wonderful articles. Changqing studied the students' works and brought them to everyone to analyze and explain. He compiled many clapper rhymes to illustrate the main points of writing. And further guided everyone from "I write about myself" to "turning outwards" on the basis of students' consciousness.
    The achievements of the experimental class attracted the attention of comrades in the whole school, but also aroused dissatisfaction among some teachers with conservative ideas. They accused Changqing of completely disrupting the existing rules and regulations; saying that his method was a local method, with no new content; that it was putting the cart before the horse and trying to be different. Some people even said: "The students don't know the representative works of Zola, Goethe, and Bai Juyi. What does it mean to be able to write a little bit, what is it that they can reach the standard of senior primary school!" But Changqing was still full of confidence in his work. He calmly analyzed people's doubts and criticisms to improve the writing teaching method. For example, he did not pay attention to the training of words, phrases, and sentences before, but after others pointed it out, he made up for this shortcoming and listed it as an important step in the writing teaching method.
    Now, Changqing's experience has been gradually promoted from the Second Advanced Infantry School to the entire army. All units implementing Changqing's writing teaching method have proven the superiority of this method. But Changqing did not regard this method as an immutable "golden rule," and he is still continuing to study it. He said: "I will never be satisfied with temporary achievements, I will continue to work tirelessly."

    揭开工农兵写作之谜
    ——记常青写作教学法的创造经过
    吴明
    人民解放军各部队自展开大规模的文化学习运动以来，在教学上的创造，真像“百花齐放”！最近出现的“常青写作教学法”，又是“百花”中比较灿烂的一朵。这朵花的创造者常青同志，是一位热情奔放、充满活力的青年团员。他在党和青年团的培养下，在上级的领导下，在祁建华、高玉宝等同志模范事迹的启示下，认真研究和分析了工农兵在初步识字以后学习写作上的规律，创造了新的“写作教学法”。实践证明，这一方法是有效的，它符合部队中广大指战员的需要，在写作上给他们指出了一条捷径。
    部队速成识字教学结束以后，广大的指挥员和战斗员开始了大量写作的活动，可是他们右手执笔，左手拿着块手巾，写不上一句，就要擦一下汗。红军老战士马天祥，虽然能看一般的文件，但是写不出三百字的文章。他每天找常青教他写日记，以练习写作。人民解放军华北军区第二高级步兵学校的陈万谥队长领导的一个队，是全校最好的一个队，人家叫陈队长写点经验登在校刊上，好让大家学习；但他说这比做好工作还难，他只好找常青替他写了由他照抄。许多同志有了一定的文化程度以后，都想用笔写点心里的话，但不敢写、写不出，他们便去询问常青写作究竟有什么“秘诀”。常青一一答复了他们。从这里，常青开始体会到：“这是群众共同的迫切要求，应该想办法来解决！”于是，在他的头脑中产生了一种愿望：能有那么一个方法，像速成识字那样来解决写作问题有多好啊……。
    在一次座谈会上，五十七个人向常青递了小纸条，都说写作是一件令人头痛的事。有一个学员说：
    “有一回教员要我写‘参观某兵营的生活’。我说：我们就生活在这个兵营里，还要参观什么？他说：这是作文呀！你写吧，多用些名词把它写得精彩些！”有的学员说：“刚一想写的时候，教员就问：你打算用什么体裁？是说明文还是叙事文？写不上几句，教员又对我们说：要抓住中心呀！不要重复囉嗦呀……。这样，我们就害怕作文啦！”有的说：“心里有的话不叫写，要像小孩子一样，硬叫跟着人家走。”
    诸如此类的问题，弄得常青也“头痛”起来了。他就去和别的教员研究。有人告诉他：写作就是个头痛的事，开始他们怕，但是功到自然成，慢慢地就好啦！“写作就是叫人怕，就是叫人头痛的吗？”常青开始怀疑起来。“只要不怕，不就不头痛了吗？对，就这样！”但他不敢把这个大胆的打算告诉任何人。
    这时，常青所在的第二高级步兵学校的领导方面，也开始注意了这个问题。该校一大队李师钊副政委，叫常青研究以往的语文教学总结报告，寻觅解决这个问题的途径。常青费了三天的时间把七十一份总结报告所提出的问题归纳了一下，总共有百十条。这就弄得常青无所适从了。李副政委一看就笑了，告诉他：“你把这些经验再仔细研究一番，把成功的经验留下来。”常青就按照这个指示，把“错别字集中突击”、“联系实际”等几个原则保留了下来。但他怀疑这些经验，便抽了学员的二百份作业来对照研究。他发现凡是写自己，或写自己熟悉的、感受深的事物的文章，都写得很好。他想其中定有“奥妙”。他开始思索起来：“学员肚里有好文章，问题是如何引出来。”他把自己所发现的问题告诉给李副政委，李副政委觉得这很有道理，希望他继续想下去，并且指示他再深入地进行研究。
    接着常青调查了一百多个学员的学习情况（其中有师团级干部，有战士，还有勤杂人员；有年老的经过长征的战士，也有十八九岁的青年）。他虚心地倾听他们的意见，冷静地观察和分析同志们所提出来的各种问题。
    有一天，一个炊事员给墙报写了个快板，大家都说很好。常青看了这篇文章，也被感动了。他马上去找这位炊事员，想了解一下他的“创作过程”。炊事员正在那里切菜，一看常青来了，高兴得了不得，他放下菜刀说：
    “我写这个快板的过程是很简单的，头天晚上我把快板上写的事情，向俺班里嘟哝了一下，大家说好，第二天就写出来了。”
    “先嘟哝一遍就能写好吗？那为什么呢？”
    “为什么，你想吧！事情都是现成的，说一遍就是把事情给归拢一下……。”
    “噢！有道理。”常青就从这个炊事员身上，发现了“说文”的好处。他又找了个司号员来试验。这个司号员最怕写文章，但常青并不说叫他写文章，而是先和他谈心事。司号员谈了自己一生中最难忘的事情，常青叫他写，司号员问：“那行吗？”常青说：“怎么说怎么写，准行。”司号员一听，劲头就来了，用睡午觉的时间把它写出来了。当他把文章拿给常青看时，他的眼还红着呢。常青知道他是哭着写的，眼泪和墨水流在一起了。文章写得多么生动呀！看着看着，常青的眼睛也湿润起来了。
    经过深入的调查研究，常青对工农兵写作的规律有了个大概的了解：首先要打掉“十怕”，冲破“三关”；从自己写起——“我写我”；写前先“说文”……。他把自己的意见告诉了李副政委，李副政委仔细斟酌了一番，就说：“你需要来个小组试验！”
    常青找了四个同志，把他们组织成为一个学习小组。他利用午睡时间在他们中间进行试验。常青称这个试验小组为“揭开写作之谜”组。
    四人中有一个司务长，他虽然早就认识了两千来字，但写起来却只能用上五百来字。他已写了两年的日记，每天是萝卜、白菜、大葱。他问司务长为什么要写这样的日记，司务长说：“别人早就告诉我，写日记写长了能锻炼写作能力，可是我这样写了二年，经验只有一条——写不写没啥。”说完，两个人都笑了。常青便叫他先“说文”，然后动手写，结果在不到三小时的时间内就写了篇近千字的文章，内容非常深刻具体，有血有肉。常青从这位司务长身上得到了启示：工农兵有写作的能力。
    但是，事情并不是完全按照常青的愿望发展的，他也曾碰到不少的麻烦，可是他并没有灰心。有两个学员写着写着，把钢笔一甩就不写啦，问原因，他们怎么也不说。最后，常青发现他们有自馁的情绪，怕自己的土话上了文章活出洋相。他经过研究，肯定了必须用自己的话来写才能写好。
    试验结果，四个人的成绩比预计的还好，常青被他们的文章所激动，有点沉不住气了。李副政委对他说千万要全面一些，不要被个别的现象所蒙蔽。常青便反复地学习了毛主席的“湖南农民运动考察报告”，研究了高玉宝的写作经验。他非常重视高玉宝在写作中把不会写的字先划个记号代替的方法，因为他发现许多人在写作时往往被一字一词“卡住壳”，打断了“文思”，写不下去，因而他提出必须“跳障碍，补窟窿”。他为了研究工农兵的语言，又专门精读了斯大林同志的“马克思主义与语言学问题”和毛主席的“反对党八股”。
    经过将近一个月的调查研究，思索观察，试验总结，他以十分谨慎的态度，写成了关于新的写作教学方法的初步意见。学校首长认为他的经验是好的，便决定成立试验班，要常青继续进行试验。
    常青回忆这一段的工作情形时说：“我深深地感到我们的党和上级对一个同志的关心和培养。”党的支部书记经常找他谈话，并鼓励他。许多同志主动地给他介绍材料、书籍，帮助他进行研究。深更半夜，常青伏在桌上写东西时，通讯员偷偷地给他送开水来，又悄悄地走开；雨天夜凉，同宿舍的同志把大衣、毯子送给常青披在身上，常青说：“他们都清楚地知道我在干什么！”这一切都使常青更加兢兢业业了。夜间他因为想问题，常常不能睡好。为了避免影响同志们的睡眠，他往往把本子垫在肚皮上摸着黑写下来，或者到路灯底下进行写作。
    今年“八一”建军节以后，“写作教学法”试验班成立了。常青说：“我是多么兴奋愉快！我要担起这重担。”
    试验班共有四十三个学员，都是初小程度。常青一动员，学员们可高兴透啦，都说：“写文章的门给我们大大地打开了！”每个人开始了写作。有的同志一次就拟定了十几个题目，准备进行“说文”写作；有的同志一口气写了两千八百多字，别人要他休息，他还在后边写上“还要续写”。
    这时常青虽然明确认识了工农兵写作的要点，但是对于具体的实施步骤，却不大明确。常青在谈到他初次试验的情形时说：“那时，每一步都是困难，但又是那样的引人入胜！”学员们的写作热情像山洪倾泻一样，不可遏止，他们写出了许多精采的文章。常青研究了学员的作品，并把它们拿来给大家分析讲解。他编了许多快板，来说明关于写作的诸要点。并进一步在学员自觉的基础上，诱导大家从“我写我”转到“向外转”。
    试验班的成绩引起了全校同志的注意，但也引起了某些带有保守思想的教员的不满。他们指责常青，说他完全打乱了已有的成规；说他的办法是土办法，没有新内容；是本末倒置，标新立异。有的人甚至说：“学员们不知道左拉、歌德、白居易的代表作，光是能写一点，算得上什么高小程度！”但常青对自己的工作仍然充满了信心，他冷静地分析了人们的怀疑和非难，以改进写作教学法。譬如他原来不注意字词句的训练，经别人提出来以后，就把这个缺点弥补起来了，并把它列为写作教学法的一个重要步骤。
    现在，常青的经验已由第二高级步兵学校逐渐推广到全军了。所有实施常青写作教学法的单位，都证明了这个方法的优越性。但常青并没有把这个方法当做一成不变的“金科玉律”，他仍在继续钻研中。他说：“我决不满足于一时的成就，我要不懈地努力下去。”
