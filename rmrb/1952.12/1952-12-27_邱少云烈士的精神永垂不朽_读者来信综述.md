    Readers have written to the newspaper's editorial department, praising and mourning the heroic sacrifice of the great Volunteer Army warrior Qiu Shaoyun in the Battle of Shangganling. In their letters, they unanimously expressed: they will carry forward the patriotism, internationalism, and collectivism of Martyr Qiu Shaoyun into their work and study.
    Zhang Julang from a certain tank regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote: "I have read the Korean correspondence 'The Great Warrior Qiu Shaoyun' several times with gratitude and grief. I put the newspaper of that day in my bag, and whenever I have time, I take it out and reread it. Every time I read the words of Martyr Qiu Shaoyun to his comrade Li Shihu before his sacrifice: 'Victory is ours, but I cannot complete the demolition mission. I entrust this mission to you!' I can't help but shed tears. I feel that Comrade Qiu Shaoyun not only entrusted the mission to Li Shihu alone, but to all the Chinese people. I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and I will actively study military technology, master modern military weapons, and resolutely complete the task of defending the motherland." Ru Yongliang, a soldier from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote: "The soldiers in our unit are all proud of Comrade Qiu Shaoyun's heroic deeds. We are determined to take Comrade Qiu Shaoyun's spirit as an example, strive to improve our cultural and military skills, stand on the defense line of the motherland, and prepare to strike any imperialists who dare to invade our country!" Wang Wenbao and Xing Guoqing from the People's Public Security Forces wrote: They guarantee to use the spirit of Martyr Qiu Shaoyun to fiercely strike the enemy on the "invisible front," protect the safety of the people, and protect the smooth progress of the motherland's peaceful construction.
    Many cadres wrote, proposing to commemorate Martyr Qiu Shaoyun by doing their own work well. Zhang Shijun from the General Office of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China said in his letter: "The heroic deeds of Martyr Qiu Shaoyun have given me a great education. The noble qualities of the working class, that 'the interests of the whole are above everything else,' are fully embodied in Martyr Qiu Shaoyun. I must learn from his noble collectivist spirit and do more work for the people to strengthen the power to strike against the American aggressors!" A comrade named Wei from the Third Wholesale Department of the Beijing Municipal Company of the China General Merchandise Company wrote in a letter: "Our accounting group discussed the heroic deeds of Martyr Qiu Shaoyun, and the slogan unanimously put forward was: In the ongoing increase production and practice economy movement in the state-owned trade system, we must strive to improve work efficiency and fully complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities to mourn Comrade Qiu Shaoyun. Wang Hongqi also proposed specific guarantees to achieve three quicks (quick eyes, quick memory, quick calculation) and one accuracy (accurate figures)."
    The heroic sacrifice of Martyr Qiu Shaoyun moved the broad masses of young people in the motherland. A study group from Tianjin University, signed by four people, wrote: "We repeatedly read Comrade Qiu Shaoyun's heroic deeds, shedding tears. In order to commemorate this great warrior and establish our permanent fighting goal, our group has been named the 'Qiu Shaoyun Mutual Aid Learning Group,' and we have incorporated our specific learning plan into the patriotic pact. Everyone also repeatedly expressed their attitude: In future practical actions, we must live up to this heroic warrior who sacrificed for the motherland and for peace."
