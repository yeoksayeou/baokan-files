Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th (TASS dispatch): The National Committee of the Communist Party USA has issued a statement to the press denouncing the State Department's rejection of the Soviet Union's ceasefire proposals at the Seventh UN General Assembly.
	The statement said that the State Department rejected this proposal based on a policy "which, if not reversed by the American people, will lead to an expansion of the war, increase the danger of a Third World War, and bring disaster to our people. The current stalemate in the Korean armistice negotiations is due to the State Department's stubborn insistence, in violation of international law and practice, that it has the right to decide which prisoners of war should be repatriated and which should not. Naturally, North Korea and China cannot accept such a unilateral proposal. India's proposal is identical to that of Washington and its allies. It clearly cannot help break the deadlock; it has already been rejected by the Korean and Chinese side.
	"The American people want peace. They have every reason to hate the Korean War.
	"The vast majority of the American people only feel hatred for this terrible and brutal war of aggression. But the monopolists who run our government and formulate its policies have a completely different view of the Korean War. They value this war and want this war because this war brings them 50 billion dollars in bloody profits, because this war creates a frenzied arms race that allows them to obtain many more billions of dollars..."
	The National Committee of the Communist Party USA finally called on the American people—workers, farmers, professionals, women, youth, all democratic forces—to insist on an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

    美共痛斥美政府拒绝苏联对朝鲜问题建议
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：美国共产党全国委员会对报界发表声明，痛斥国务院拒绝苏联在第七届联合国大会提出的停火建议。
    这个声明说，国务院拒绝这个建议是本着一种政策，“这种政策，如果美国人民不加以扭转，就会使战争扩大，使第三次世界大战的危险增加，并使我国人民遭遇灾难。朝鲜停战谈判之所以产生目前的僵局，是由于国务院违反国际法和惯例，顽固地坚持它有权利决定遣返那些战俘和不遣返那些战俘。当然，北朝鲜和中国不能够接受这种片面的建议。印度的提案与华盛顿及其盟国的提案如出一辙。它显然也不能够帮助打开僵局；因为它已经被朝中方面拒绝了。
    “美国人民要求和平。他们有很充分的理由憎恶朝鲜战争。
    “绝大多数的美国人民对这种可怕的残酷的侵略战争只有憎恨。但是执掌着我们政府和制定着它的政策的垄断资本家们对于朝鲜战争却有完全不同的看法。他们看重这个战争而且要这个战争。因为这个战争给他们带来五百亿美元的血腥利润，因为这个战争制造了一场疯狂的军备竞赛，使他们可以得到更多亿万美元……”
    美国共产党全国委员会最后号召美国人民——工人、农人、自由职业者、妇女、青年、所有民主力量——坚持要求立刻在朝鲜停火。
