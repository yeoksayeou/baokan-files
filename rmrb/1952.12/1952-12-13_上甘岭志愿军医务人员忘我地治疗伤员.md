Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 12th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers who were gloriously wounded in the Battle of Shangganling have received proper treatment and care in the battlefield medical stations. They have unanimously expressed their intention to rest assured and recuperate, striving to return to the front lines as soon as possible.

Wounded soldiers, upon arriving from the battlefield, were immediately sent to battlefield medical stations for bandaging and surgical treatment. While the battle was still raging fiercely, Xiong Zhisheng, the captain of a certain surgical team, personally went to the front lines, working day and night to perform surgeries on the wounded soldiers. He almost fainted from exhaustion, but he persevered and completed all the surgeries. Some severely wounded soldiers lost too much blood, and the medical personnel all vied to donate blood to them. Some female nurses were saddened to tears because their blood types were incompatible with the wounded soldiers and they could not donate blood. Everyone believed that donating blood to the wounded soldiers was donating blood to the motherland and to peace.

The wounded soldiers received meticulous care during their recovery. Many nursing staff members used their own allowances to buy fruit for the wounded soldiers, gave their own clothes and quilts to the wounded soldiers to keep warm, and often read books, newspapers, and reported news of victories from the front. Some wounded soldiers had urinary retention and abdominal distention, and using a urinary catheter was ineffective. Nurse Xu Mingshan used her mouth to hold the urinary catheter and sucked out the accumulated urine, relieving the wounded soldier's pain. Health worker Ma Yong, who had been working continuously for more than twenty days and nights, sucked out the accumulated phlegm from the throats of severely wounded soldiers eight times, to relieve the danger of suffocation.

The wounded soldiers were extremely moved by the selfless care they received from their class brothers, and they asked to have the nursing staff members commended for their meritorious service. In letters to their superiors, the wounded soldiers stated: We will resolutely implement Commander Peng Dehuai's order issued to the entire army on the second anniversary of the Volunteer Army's participation in the war, rest assured and recuperate, and strive to return to the front lines as soon as possible.

    上甘岭志愿军医务人员忘我地治疗伤员
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】在上甘岭战斗中光荣负伤的中国人民志愿军伤员们在战地医疗所中得到了妥善的治疗和护理，他们一致表示要安心休养，争取早日重上前线。
    伤员们从战场下来，立即被送到战地医疗所进行包扎和手术治疗。当战斗还在激烈进行的时候，某手术队队长熊志生曾亲自到前线，日夜不停地为伤员们施行手术。他由于疲劳过度几乎昏倒，但他终于坚持做完了所有的手术。有的重伤员流血过多，医务人员都争着给他们输血。有的女护士曾因为自己的血型与伤员不合，不能给伤员输血而难过得流出眼泪。大家认为：把血献给伤员，就是把血献给祖国，献给和平。
    伤员们在疗养中得到了无微不至的照顾。许多护理人员用自己的津贴费买水果给伤员吃，把自己的衣服和棉被给伤员盖，并且经常给伤员念书、读报和报告前方的胜利消息。有的伤员尿闭腹胀，用排尿管也不行，护理员许明善就用嘴含着排尿管将积尿吸出，解除了伤员的痛苦。连续坚持二十多昼夜工作的卫生员马勇，曾经八次含着橡皮管吸出重伤员喉头里的积痰，以解除伤员窒息的危险。
    伤员们得到自己阶级兄弟这样忘我的照顾，都极为感动，纷纷要求给护理人员记功。伤员们在写给上级首长的信中表示：坚决执行彭德怀司令员在志愿军出国作战两周年向全军发布的命令，安心养好身体，争取早日重返前线。
