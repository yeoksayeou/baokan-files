Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch: As previously reported, the people of Kenya, a British colony in East Africa, are increasingly demanding to break free from the colonial rule of British imperialism due to their unbearable oppression and exploitation by colonial imperialists. The British colonial authorities have adopted violent suppression measures against this legitimate demand of the local people.

From the time the Kenyan colonial authorities declared martial law on October 20th to November 15th, the British colonial military and police arrested 8,500 people in less than a month, while "screening" more than 30,000 people. The search and arrest operations are still ongoing.

British Colonial Secretary Lyttelton personally flew to Kenya to arrange the suppression. After returning to London, he declared that the Kenyan people's struggle for liberation "must be suppressed." In accordance with this policy of the British government, Sir Percy Sillitoe, the head of British intelligence and director of Military Intelligence, rushed to Kenya on November 20th to direct the killings and arrests. On November 23rd, colonial police opened fire on peaceful people holding a meeting, killing and wounding dozens of people in one instance. At the same time, colonial military and police conducted large-scale searches and arrests in various villages. The Kenyan colonial authorities also publicly announced that they would take "retaliatory" measures, including arbitrary killings and arrests, as well as confiscation of livestock, closure of shops, and so-called "reforms," etc.

In order to conceal their ferocious faces, British colonial imperialists have tried their best to slander the Kenyan people's struggle against imperialist colonial rule as "Mau Mau" "terrorist activities." However, a Catholic missionary who works for the British Colonial Office and two members of the British Parliament have exposed the hypocrisy of British imperialism's propaganda.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Ottawa, Father Gillebeau, the Inspector of Basutoland, South Africa, for the British Colonial Office, accused the British Colonial Office and gold mining interests in Africa in a speech of "suppressing the (independent and autonomous) desires of the local people in order to maintain and supply cheap labor." He pointed out that this is the reason for the struggle of the people of Kenya and other African colonies against colonial rule.

British Labour Party MPs Brockway and Hale, who had gone to Kenya to understand the situation, revealed some of the tragic circumstances of the local Kenyan people under the oppression of white colonialists after returning to London. Hale said that tens of thousands of African workers there earn less than 36 pounds a year, and some even earn less than 24 pounds. This is many times lower than that of white workers. Brockway said: The reason for the people's "disappointment" is: "A satisfactory system has not been established, the people have no land, wages are meager, living conditions are extremely poor, and the prices of the staple food of the local people are high, etc."

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from London: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a speech in Sheffield on November 30th, protesting against the British government's suppression of the Kenyan people.

Pollitt condemned the Conservatives' frantic suppression of the legitimate aspirations of the Kenyan people. He commented on a telegram sent by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the director of Military Intelligence, from Kenya. Sillitoe had previously served as the Chief Constable of Sheffield and later as the Chief Constable of Glasgow. This man was once known for suppressing the legitimate struggles of the unemployed in Britain, and now he has gone to Kenya to suppress the people there.

Pollitt said: "Sillitoe must fail there as he did in Sheffield and Glasgow. He will fail there, just as Templer will fail in Malaya, and Truman, Eisenhower, and Churchill will fail in Korea."

Pollitt demanded that all British troops and armed police be withdrawn from Kenya; the release of those arrested; the implementation of freedom of the press; the return of land seized from Africans; allowing the Kenyan people to formulate a new democratic constitution, guaranteeing full rights to all trade unions, and equal rights to all Africans, Indians, and other people of color.

According to the London "Daily Worker," the North Birmingham branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union condemned the use of armed forces to attack women and children in Kenya and demanded that the leadership of the Amalgamated Engineering Union lodge a protest with the Colonial Secretary.

　　英国殖民当局疯狂进攻东非怯尼亚人民
    波立特抗议英政府的暴行并要求撤退英军
    【新华社三日讯】前已报道，英国在东非洲的殖民地怯尼亚的人民，因不堪殖民帝国主义者的压迫和榨取，日益强烈地要求摆脱英帝国主义的殖民统治。英殖民当局对当地人民的这种正当要求采取了暴力镇压的手段。
    自从怯尼亚殖民当局十月二十日宣布戒严到十一月十五日，在不到一个月中间，英国殖民军警就逮捕了八千五百人，同时“甄审”了三万余人。搜捕的工作还继续进行。
    英国殖民大臣里特尔顿曾亲自飞往怯尼亚布置镇压事宜。他在回到伦敦后宣告，对怯尼亚人民的争取解放的斗争“必须予以镇压”。按照英国政府这种方针，英国特务头子、军事情报局主任西里托十一月二十日赶往怯尼亚指挥屠杀和逮捕。十一月二十三日，殖民警察向正在举行集会的和平人民开枪，一次就打死打伤了几十人。同时，殖民军警还到各乡村大事搜捕。怯尼亚殖民当局并公开宣布要采取“报复”措施，其中除任意屠杀和逮捕外，还包括没收牲畜，封闭店铺以及所谓“改造”等等。
    英国殖民帝国主义者为掩饰他们的狰狞面目，竭力污蔑怯尼亚人民反对帝国主义殖民统治的斗争为所谓“茅社”的“恐怖活动”。但是，为英国殖民部做事的一位天主教传教士和英国国会的两位议员却揭穿了英国帝国主义的虚伪宣传。
    据合众社渥太华消息，英殖民部南非巴苏陀兰督学吉勒布神父在一次演说中指责英国殖民部和在非洲的金矿利益集团“为了保持和供应廉价劳动而镇压本地人民的（独立自主的）愿望”。他指出这才是怯尼亚和其他非洲殖民地人民反对殖民统治斗争的原因。
    曾经到怯尼亚了解情况的英国工党下院议员布罗克威和黑尔在回到伦敦后透露了一些怯尼亚本地人民在白种殖民主义者压迫下的悲惨情况。黑尔说，那里几万非洲工人每人一年的工资不到三十六英镑，有的甚至还不到二十四英镑。这比白种工人低许多倍。布罗克威说：人民“失望”的原因是：“令人满意的制度还未曾建立，人民没有土地，工资菲薄，居住情况极度恶劣，本地人民主要粮食价格高昂等。”
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特十一月三十日在设菲尔德发表演说，抗议英国政府镇压怯尼亚人民。
    波立特谴责保守党人拚命压制怯尼亚人民的正当愿望的行为。他对军事情报局主任西里托由怯尼亚拍来的一个电报发表意见。西里托曾任设菲尔德的警察厅长，后来又任格拉斯哥的警察厅长。这个人曾经因为镇压英国失业者的正当斗争而闻名，现在又到了怯尼亚去压制该地人民。
    波立特说：“西里托在该地必定和他在设菲尔德和格拉斯哥一样地失败。他要在那里失败，正如田普勒将在马来亚失败、杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔和邱吉尔将在朝鲜失败一样。”
    波立特要求把全部英国军队与武装警察撤出怯尼亚；释放被捕者；实行新闻自由；归还从非洲人手中抢来的土地；允许怯尼亚人民制订新的民主宪法，保证给一切工会以充分的权利，给一切非洲人、印度人和其他有色人以平等的权利。
    据伦敦《工人日报》报道，混合机器工会北明翰分会谴责使用武装部队进攻怯尼亚的妇孺，并且要求混合机器工会领导机关向殖民大臣提出抗议。
