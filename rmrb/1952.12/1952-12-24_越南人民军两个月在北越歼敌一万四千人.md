Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam Dispatch from Vietnam News Agency on the 23rd: The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army recently announced that the Vietnamese People's Army and people's armed forces annihilated 14,000 French troops in North Vietnam in the two months beginning in mid-October. Among them, 6,029 were annihilated in Northwest Vietnam, including the entire French Moroccan 3rd Battalion, seven companies of the Bao Dai puppet army's 55th and 56th Battalions, and three-quarters of the local Tai puppet army. Eighty percent of those annihilated were captured.

The People's Army captured many French officers and non-commissioned officers. In the Northwest alone, eighteen French officers of the rank of captain or higher were captured, including nearly all the commanders of the larger French strongholds in the area.

In Northwest Vietnam, the People's Army liberated 250,000 people and 80 percent of the land in the former French-occupied areas, thwarting the French army's vicious plot to establish a "Tai Autonomous State" to implement "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."

In these two months, the People's Army seized enough machine guns and rifles alone to equip five regiments, as well as fifteen artillery pieces, eighty-five mortars, twenty-one transport vehicles and jeeps, one tank, and hundreds of tons of ammunition and other military supplies. Almost all of these munitions and military supplies were supplied to the French colonialists by the American interventionists in the name of "military aid."

    越南人民军两个月在北越歼敌一万四千人
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部最近公布：越南人民军和人民武装，在从十月中旬开始的两个月间在北越歼灭了法军一万四千人。其中，在越南西北部歼灭的有六千零二十九人，包括法军摩洛哥第三营全营、保大傀儡军第五十五和第五十六两营的七个连和当地全部泰族傀儡军的四分之三，俘获的人数占百分之八十。
    人民军俘获了许多法军军官和士官。单在西北部就俘获了上尉级以上的法军军官十八名，包括了这一带差不多全部法军较大据点的指挥官。
    人民军在越南西北部解放了二十五万人口和前法军占领区的百分之八十的土地，粉碎了法军建立“泰族自治邦”以实行“用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋。
    人民军在这两个月中缴获的武器，单是机枪和步枪就足够装备五个团的军队，还有大炮十五门、迫击炮八十五门、运输车和吉普车二十一辆、坦克一辆、和数以百吨计的弹药和其他军事供应品。这些军火和军用物资几乎全部是美国干涉者在“军事援助”的名义下供应法国殖民者的。
