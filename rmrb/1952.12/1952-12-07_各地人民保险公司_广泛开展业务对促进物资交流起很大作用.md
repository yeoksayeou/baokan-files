Local People's Insurance Companies have widely developed transportation insurance business including trains, automobiles, airplanes, ships, wooden boats, and postal transportation in the whole country, in order to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and between inside and outside. More than 50% of the nation's transported materials are now insured. In the Northeast region, 90% of the transportation materials of state-owned enterprises are insured.

In order to reduce the cost of commodity circulation, the People's Insurance Company has reduced the rate of water and land transportation insurance five times since its establishment. Insurance business eliminates the concerns of the insured about accidental disasters, enabling them to carry out transportation business with peace of mind; at the same time, it turns uncertain losses into fixed minor insurance premium expenditures, which also enables them to accurately calculate transportation costs and improve all work.

For insured transportation materials, the People's Insurance Company not only quickly compensates for losses after disasters occur, but also actively assists relevant departments in carrying out various disaster prevention work in advance, greatly reducing the losses of public and private property. For example, this year, the Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company cooperated with navigation agencies in Baotou, Shanba and other places along the Yellow River to carry out disaster prevention education for boatmen, and formed temporary mutual aid groups for ships in operation to help each other rescue in the event of an accident. Therefore, the disaster loss rate in the first half of this year decreased by one-half compared with the same period last year.

Many facts have proved that carrying out insurance work plays a great role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. During the Beijing Materials Exchange Conference, the Beijing Mining and Oil Refining Industry purchased a batch of heavy diesel oil from the Ninghe County Trust Company in Hebei Province. Because insurance was implemented, the responsibility for leakage during transportation was resolved. When this batch of diesel oil was shipped, the Ninghe County Branch of the People's Insurance Company checked the packaging and put forward disaster prevention suggestions. As a result, this batch of heavy oil was not damaged at all when it was transported to Beijing. During the Southwest Materials Exchange Conference in July this year, the Hunan delegation sold a batch of Liling porcelain to the Dazhou County representative from northern Sichuan, and the Kunming representative from Yunnan sold a batch of pickled mustard tuber to the representative from southern Sichuan. The transactions had been negotiated, but the problem of breakage responsibility of porcelain and jar-packed goods during transportation could not be solved, so the transactions could not be concluded. Finally, the problem was solved through insurance. (Du Zijie)

    各地人民保险公司
    广泛开展业务对促进物资交流起很大作用
    各地人民保险公司为促进城乡内外物资交流，在全国范围内广泛地开展了包括火车、汽车、飞机、轮船、木船、驿运等各种运输工具的运输保险业务。全国运输物资已有百分之五十以上实行保险。东北区国营企业的运输物资投保的已达百分之九十。
    为了减轻商品流转成本，人民保险公司从开业以来，曾先后五次降低水陆运输保险费率。保险业务使投保者消除了对意外灾害的顾虑，使他们能够放心地进行运输业务；同时把不定的损失化为固定的少数的保险费支出，还能使他们精确计算运输成本，改进全部工作。
    对于投保的运输物资，人民保险公司不仅在发生灾害后迅速补偿损失，同时还积极协助有关部门，在事前进行各种防灾工作，大大减少了公私资财的损失。例如，人民保险公司绥远省分公司今年在黄河沿岸的包头、陕坝等地，和航务机构配合，对船工进行了防灾教育，并把行驶中的船只组成临时互助组，以便在发生事故时互相帮助抢救，因此，今年上半年灾害损失率比去年同时期减少了二分之一。
    许多事实证明，开展保险工作，对促进城乡物资交流有很大的作用。北京矿油炼制业在北京物资交流大会中向河北省宁河县信托公司购进一批重柴油，由于实行了保险，解决了运输途中的渗漏责任问题。这批柴油起运时，人民保险公司宁河县支公司曾验看包装，并提出防灾建议，结果这批重油运到北京丝毫未受损失。今年七月西南区物资交流大会中，湖南代表团卖一批醴陵磁器给川北达县代表，云南昆明代表卖一批大头菜给川南代表，各方交易已经洽妥，但因磁器和坛装在运输途中的破碎责任问题不能解决，以致无法成交。最后通过保险，解决了这个问题。（杜子杰）
