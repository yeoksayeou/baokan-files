    The Captives
    – Excerpts from a Korean Diary, Part 3
    Bai Lang
    After a week of intense activity, we concluded our visit to Pyongyang and reluctantly left this heroic city.
    However, we did not leave the beautiful land of Korea. For a whole day and night, we enjoyed the cultivation of picturesque scenery, traveling through towering mountains. We arrived at the prisoner-of-war camp before sunset the next day. That evening, we held a small discussion with British prisoners. Starting the next morning, we spoke separately with British and American prisoners for six or seven hours. More than forty prisoners participated in the meetings.
    The discussions were arranged in a large conference room. As soon as we entered, a group of tall British men rushed to shake our hands. Seeing them, I immediately felt an uncomfortable emotion, naturally thinking of the misfortunes suffered by the Korean people. Suddenly, Mrs. Felton's scream dispelled that unpleasant atmosphere:
    "Good heavens, Campbell! Your eyes are so much like your mother's! I'm so happy to see you!"
    Campbell was a slender, twenty-year-old British youth with deep eyes and silent lips. The expression on his face was one of childish stubbornness, and his entire outline appeared very intelligent. Mrs. Felton had never met him, but today she recognized him by his eyes. I immediately remembered the story she had told more than once:
    In London, there was an old woman actively fighting for peace. A year ago, she was purely a housewife who saw every small thing in life as the most important part of her existence. She wouldn't allow a wrinkle on the sheets or a speck of dust on the floor... She spent her years in this way. However, after she received a letter from Mrs. Felton from Korea, she suddenly became fully aware. From then on, she became casual about the trivial matters of life. She said, "Working for peace is the only thing I should be doing." Soon, she became an active organizer of the peace movement. Her speeches were always vivid and were welcomed by the masses. Reactionaries spread rumors:
    "Mrs. Campbell has become a communist; she has been bought!"
    But she did not see this as an insult; she proudly said:
    "If the Communist Party is fighting for peace, why would it need to buy me? Why can't I be a glorious Communist Party member?"
    This woman was Campbell's mother; she was inspired and advised by a letter from Campbell to join the peace movement.
    Campbell didn't say much at either of the discussions, always sitting quietly with happy and proud eyes, occasionally glancing at the Chinese comrades present with friendly eyes, revealing unspoken gratitude in his gaze.
    The British prisoners were most concerned about the peace movement in Britain. Mrs. Felton began by giving a comprehensive introduction.
    "For the British people, the Korean War is not just a Korean problem, but an issue that directly affects the lives of the British people. The situation in Britain is getting more and more difficult. Each person is rationed only two ounces of butter a week, and prices are rising daily. There is no steel, construction has stopped, and a house costs four pounds a week to rent..."
    "Oh my, that's so expensive?" the prisoners exclaimed in unison with wide, surprised eyes.
    "This kind of thing has awakened the women," Mrs. Felton continued. "The British people have tasted the bitterness of war, so they oppose America's expansion of armaments... American occupation forces in Britain have their own courts, and even minor matters are tried in American courts. Friends in Shanghai said that Britain used to have extraterritorial rights in China, but now the United States has it in Britain!"
    Hearing this, the prisoners all lowered their heads and sighed. Mrs. Felton continued with a wry smile:
    "In 1949, I was invited to the Middle East, and when people asked me about the situation of the American army in Britain, my answer was, 'They just drag the girls away!' Now, they are further rebuilding airports in Britain. The U.S. Air Force..."
    Before she could finish, a young prisoner, as if afraid the roof would collapse, held his head in his hands and pleaded:
    "Dear Mrs. Felton, please don't go on, I'm terrified!"
    Everyone looked at him with questioning eyes. He explained:
    "I haven't received a letter from my wife in ten months, and I'm really worried that she'll be dragged away by the U.S. Air Force!"
    His terrifying premonition infected many people; some were shaking their heads, some were sighing.
    Mrs. Felton said with a worried expression:
    "I sympathize with your concern. The most serious problem now is how to make Britain an independent country. This requires the struggle of the people to achieve. The British peace movement has now become a mass movement, with street organizations. I get blacklisted when I lecture. Women are even more active; they organize petition groups to demand an end to the Korean War."
    "How is my wife? Has she joined the peace work?" a prisoner who hadn't received a letter from home for a long time asked anxiously.
    "I'm sorry, I can't generally know their activities. However, I can tell you that the families of prisoners are all demanding an end to the war, because it has a direct relationship to their own vital interests."
    Smyth was a stern-faced middle-aged man who spoke proudly of his wife's affairs. He had recently received a letter from her saying that she had organized fifteen housewives who regularly held meetings at home to carry out peace work. She was a mother of three children. Smyth said to Mrs. Felton:
    "You probably don't know how uninterested she used to be in politics, but now she has also awakened. I'm so happy for her!" Smyth's eyes revealed pride, and he said with his hands on his chest in a dreamy and happy manner: "When I go back in the future, how happy we will be working together for peace." He yearned for peace so much, and he felt honored for his wife's progress.
    "We request you to contact our wives after you return to your country," Mitchs and Andrews wrote together in Mrs. Felton's small notebook, "British society is corrupt. Have our wives been enlightened? We warmly hope that they will participate in peace work. We are good friends here, and we hope that they will also become good friends in the peace movement."
    "Please tell Mrs. Rostin that I have only received one letter from her since I was captured. Please tell her how much I hope she stands with the peace-loving people of the world! She is a temporary widow. My future wife." Gore probably felt embarrassed to speak out, so he also wrote his hopes in Mrs. Felton's small notebook... Thus, the red-covered notebook was filled with fervent hopes and sincere messages, also filled with names and mailing addresses. Mrs. Felton said generously:
    "I will definitely do my best to help you with these things, and I feel honored to do so."
    The prisoners were concerned about everything and wanted to know everything. They had endless questions to ask, such as the significance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the Third World War, the implementation of the Sino-British trade agreement, and the estimates of the American election, etc. They wanted to understand China, and even more to understand the Soviet Union... It wasn't that they didn't understand the situation of those things, but they wanted to hear the views of people from their own country. When Mrs. Felton spoke about the construction of New China and the happy life of the Soviet people, the prisoners were simply beaming.
    "In Britain, we have always heard propaganda that 'the Soviet Union is preparing to invade,' but the Soviet Union has built more than 3.8 million houses in rural areas in the postwar period alone. Is it possible to have both butter and guns? It's completely slander!" Mrs. Felton expressed indignation and injustice.
    Mrs. Felton asked them to talk about their own affairs, and the atmosphere became even more lively. The prisoners spoke with a self-deprecating tone, telling of their awkwardness when they were captured, as if telling a funny story. The prisoner with the somewhat comical face raised his hands over his head, making a gesture of kneeling and said humorously:
    "Look, this is how we looked when we were captured!" He made a face at the volunteer comrades present, which made everyone laugh. Another continued:
    "At that time, we believed that being captured meant death; there was no other conclusion. Before saying goodbye to this world, we might have to suffer some torture, right? However, the officer of the Chinese People's Volunteers came over and shook hands with each of us. This made us feel confused. No, we were simply stunned! What kind of conspiracy is this? We thought.
    "Afterwards, the volunteers told us that they would not punish us for our personal crimes. We couldn't understand this at all. Some people refused to leave, and some shouted, 'Just shoot us on the spot!' The volunteers smiled and said, 'Don't worry, we won't lay a finger on you. We will even treat your injuries.'"
    The person with the comical face interjected:
    "Who believed their words? We followed along, but secretly resolved to kill the escorts on the way. But we couldn't find an opportunity." He paused and added, "Fortunately, we didn't find an opportunity. If we had followed our wishes at the time, the sin would have been even greater!"
    One after another, they spoke, describing how the humane and friendly treatment of the volunteers deeply moved and surprised them. The stern-faced middle-aged prisoner said with a glint of anger in his eyes:
    "And the American army not only created the Koje Island massacre, but also bombed their own prisoners. That's enough to wake us up."
    Speaking of the change in their outlook on life, they talked a lot. They believed that "the greatest gratitude and respect should be paid to the volunteer comrades. The volunteers not only have fearless courage, but also have superhuman wisdom." They couldn't help but admire them wholeheartedly.
    "The volunteers never force us to accept anything. Believe it if you believe it; don't believe it if you don't. Before, we didn't even know what a meeting was, but now we understand why the United States is waging a war of aggression."
    In a conversation with American prisoners, an American prisoner told an interesting story:
    Once, while they were being escorted, Kees accidentally burned down a fellow villager's house. He was immediately taken away by the volunteer squad leader escorting them. Those who were left looked at each other, all worried for Kees. They thought: Kees must have been taken away to be shot, and he might even implicate them. But, after a while, Kees was brought back. After entering the house, the squad leader first let him sit down, and then said:
    "Kees, give a self-criticism to everyone!"
    "That was the beginning of our learning," the prisoner said with a smile at the end of the story.
    The black prisoner Adam naively told the story of his capture, saying that what happened at the time was the most unexpected thing in his life: Could he still not die after being captured? After speaking, he smiled honestly:
    "If I had died at that time, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to receive so much education that is meaningful to me."
    Quinn was an American Air Force prisoner who had dropped germ bombs in Korea, but his outlook on life was also changing. When he was summoned to speak, he was still holding a copy of "The Conspiracy Against the People." He said to Mrs. Felton:
    "I heard that when you returned to Britain last year, the government wanted to charge you with treason. But according to the definition in this book, betraying the people is called treason. It is the ruling class of our country itself that should be punished in this way. And you have done work that is beneficial to the people."
    When germ warfare was mentioned, Quinn lowered his eyelids. He said that all his friends who had participated in germ warfare felt ashamed! They felt that their crimes were unforgivable! But the treatment they received was unexpected. He said gratefully:
    "No matter how many evils we have committed, the volunteers have taught us a lot. In the past, people said I was reactionary, and I didn't understand at all, but now my ears, eyes, mouth, and nose are all open. I love China, and I love the Soviet Union even more... You have the opportunity to tell the people of the West how great the work the Chinese people are doing..."

    俘虏们
    ——朝鲜见闻录之三
    白朗
    经过了一个礼拜的紧张活动，我们便结束了平壤的访问，恋恋不舍地离开了这座英雄的城市。
    但是，我们并没有离开朝鲜美丽的国土，整整一昼夜，我们享受着绮丽风光的陶冶，穿行于崇山峻岭中。第二天太阳落山以前，我们到了俘虏营。当天晚上就和英国俘虏举行了小型的座谈；第二天从早晨开始，又和英美俘虏分别谈了六七个钟点。参加会议的俘虏前后有四十多人。
    座谈会布置在一间宽大的会议室里，我们一走进去，就有一群高个子的英国人赶来和我们握手。看见他们，我心里立刻产生了一种不舒服的感情，很自然地就想起了朝鲜人民所遭受的那些不幸。突然，费尔顿夫人的一声尖叫，把那种不愉快的空气冲淡了：
    “天哪，坎伯尔！你的眼睛多像你的母亲？看见了你真使我高兴！”
    坎伯尔是一个细高的二十岁的英国青年，他长着一双深沉的眼睛和沉默的嘴唇，脸上的表情，带着稚气的倔强，他的整个轮廓是显得很聪明的。费尔顿夫人并没见过他，今天却从他的眼睛上认出了他。我立刻想起了她讲过不止一次的那个故事：
    在伦敦，有一个为和平积极斗争的老女人。一年以前，她还是一个纯粹的家庭妇女，她把生活中每一件小事都看成生命中最重要的部分，她不让床单有一个皱折，不允许地板上有一点灰尘……。她就是这样地消磨着她的岁月。可是，当她收到了费尔顿夫人从朝鲜带回去的一封信后，突然完全清醒过来。从此，生活中的琐事，她得过且过了。她说：“和平工作，才是我唯一该做的事情。”很快地，她便成了和平运动的积极组织者。她每次讲演都很生动，受到了广大群众的欢迎。反动派造谣说：
    “坎伯尔夫人变成共产党了，她被收买了！”
    但她却不认为这是侮蔑，她骄傲地说：
    “假如共产党是为和平而斗争的，又何用收买？我为什么不可以做一个光荣的共产党员呢？”
    这女人就是坎伯尔的母亲，她是受了坎伯尔一封信的鼓舞和劝告而参加和平工作的。
    在两次座谈会上，坎伯尔都没怎么说话，总在闪着快乐而骄傲的眼睛，静静地坐着，偶尔也用友好的眼光向在座的中国同志扫视一下，那眼光里流露着无言的感激。
    英国俘虏们最关心的是英国的和平运动。费尔顿夫人首先就做了全面的介绍。
    “对英国人民来讲，朝鲜战争不单是朝鲜问题，而是可以直接影响英国人民生活的问题。目前英国情况越来越苦了，一个礼拜每人只配给二两牛油，物价一日数涨；没有钢，建筑已停止，一间房子每礼拜要四镑租金。……”
    “哎呀，那样贵？”俘虏们瞪大着惊异的眼睛，异口同声地说。
    “这样的事，使妇女醒过来了。”费尔顿夫人接着说：“英国人民尝过战争滋味，因此，他们反对美国的扩张军备计划……。美国占领军在英国有自己的法庭，一点小事也在美国法庭审判。上海朋友说，英国过去在中国有治外法权，如今美国在英国竟也有了！”
    听到这里，俘虏们都垂头叹气。费尔顿夫人苦笑着继续说道：
    “一九四九年我应邀去中东，人家问到我美军在英国的情况，我的回答是：‘拖起女孩子就走！’目前，更进一步在英国重建机场了。美国空军……”
    话还没完，一个年轻的俘虏就像怕屋顶塌下来似地双手抱头恳求道：
    “亲爱的费尔顿夫人，你别再说下去了，我感到恐怖！”
    大家都用疑惑的眼睛询问他。他解释道：
    “我已经十个月不接我妻子的来信了，我真担心她会被美空军拖走！”
    他的恐怖的预感传染了很多人，有的在摇头，有的在叹气。
    费尔顿夫人带着忧虑的神情说：
    “我很同情你这种担心。现在最严重的问题是如何使英国成为一个独立的国家。这就要靠人民的斗争去取得。现在英国和平运动已经成为群众性的运动了，有街道组织，我讲演时都有黑票。妇女们更积极，她们组织请愿团要求制止朝鲜战争。”
    “我的老婆怎样？参加了和平工作吗？”一个很久没接到家信的俘虏急切地问。
    “我很抱歉，我不能普遍知道她们的活动。不过，我可以告诉你，俘虏家属都在要求制止战争，因为这与她们的切身利害有直接关系。”
    史沫特是一个面孔很严厉的中年男人，他很得意地讲着他妻子的事情：他最近接到她的来信，她说她已经组织了十五个家庭妇女经常在家里开会进行和平工作。她是三个孩子的母亲。史沫特对费尔顿夫人说：
    “大概你不会知道，她原来是怎样对政治毫无兴趣的人，可是现在她也觉醒了。我真为她高兴呵！”史沫特两眼流露着骄傲，两手抚胸，梦幻般快乐地说：“我将来回去，我们两个在一起做和平工作，该多幸福呢。”他是那样地向往着和平，为妻子的进步而感到光荣。
    “我们请求你回国后和我们的妻子取得联系。”密奇斯和安得勿一同在费尔顿夫人的小本子上写道，“英国社会是腐败的，我们的妻子是否得到了启发？我们热烈地希望她们参加和平工作。我们在这里是好朋友，希望她们也在和平运动中成为好朋友。”
    “恳请你向罗斯丁夫人说，我被俘后只接她一封信。请告诉她我是如何希望她和世界爱好和平人民站在一起！她是个暂时的寡妇。我未来的妻子。”戈尔大概是不好意思开口，也把他的希望写在费尔顿夫人的小本子上。……于是那个红皮小本子上，充满了热烈的希望和恳切的寄语，也充满了人名和通讯地址。费尔顿夫人慷慨地说：
    “这些事我一定尽量为你们办到，我正为此而感到光荣。”
    俘虏们什么都关心，什么都想知道，他们有的是提不完的问题：如像亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义啦，第三次世界大战啦，中英贸易协议的实行情况啦，以及什么美国大选的估计啦等等。他们想了解中国，更想了解苏联……。他们并不是不了解那些事情的情况，而是想听听他们自己国家的人的见解。当费尔顿夫人讲到新中国的建设和苏联人民的幸福生活时，俘虏们简直就眉飞色舞了。
    “在英国，一直听到‘苏联准备侵略’的宣传，但是，苏联单在战后时期中，就在乡村建筑了三百八十多万栋住宅。又要奶油，又要枪炮，这是可能的吗？完全是污蔑！”费尔顿夫人表示着愤慨和不平。
    费尔顿夫人要他们谈谈自己的事情，空气更活泼起来。俘虏们带着自嘲的口气，讲着自己被俘时的窘相，就像讲着可笑的故事一样。那个面孔有点滑稽的俘虏把两手举过头顶，做着要跪倒的姿势幽默地说：
    “看哪，我们被俘的时候，就是这个相！”他向在座的志愿军同志做了个鬼脸，惹得大家都笑了。另一个接下去说：
    “那当儿，我们认定被俘就是死，没有第二种结论。在向这个世界告别之前，可能还要挨一顿非刑吧？可是，中国人民志愿军的军官走过来，和我们每一个人握手。这使我们感到迷惑。不，简直是惊呆了！这是什么阴谋呀？我们想。
    “随后，志愿军告诉我们：他们不会以我们个人的罪行来处罚我们的。这话我们无论如何都不能了解。有的人死不肯走，有的人就叫起来：‘要枪毙就当场吧！’志愿军笑了笑说：‘放心吧，我们不会戳你们一手指头的。带伤的人还要给你们治好呢。’”
    那个有着一付滑稽面孔的人抢着说：
    “谁相信他们的话呢？走是跟着走了，暗中却下定决心：走在半路上一定要打死押送的人。可是竟没有找到机会。”他停了一下又补充道：“幸亏没找到机会，如果随了当时的心愿，罪孽就更大了！”
    他们一个接着一个发言，描绘着志愿军的人道与友好的待遇如何使得他们深受感动和大为吃惊。那个面孔很严厉的中年俘虏闪烁着愤怒的眼睛说：
    “而美国军队不但制造巨济岛血案，还来轰炸他们自己的俘虏。这就够使我们清醒过来了。”
    谈到人生观的改变时，他们讲了很多很多。他们认为：“应该向志愿军同志致以最大的感激和敬佩，志愿军不但有着无畏的神勇，更具有着超人的智慧。”真不能不叫他们五体投地了。
    “志愿军从来不强迫我们接受任何东西，信就信，不信就不信。从前，我们连什么叫开会都不懂，现在却认识了美国为什么要进行侵略战争。”
    在和美国俘虏的谈话中，一个美俘讲了一个有趣的故事：
    一次，他们在被押送途中，吉斯不小心烧着了老乡的房子。他立刻被押送的志愿军班长带走了。留下的人你望望我，我望望你，都替吉斯捏一把汗。他们想：吉斯一定被带去枪毙了，说不定还要连累自己。可是，过一会，吉斯却被带回来了。进得屋来，那班长先让他坐下，然后说：
    “吉斯，向大家做自我批评吧！”
    “这就是我们学习的开端。”那个俘虏结束这故事时笑着说。
    黑人俘虏亚当很天真地讲他被俘的故事，他说当时所发生的是他生平最意料不到的事：被俘还能不死吗？讲完，他憨憨地笑着说：
    “假如那时死了，就没机会受到这末多对我有意义的教育了。”
    奎恩是在朝鲜投掷过细菌弹的美国空军俘虏，可是，他的人生观也在改变中。当他被召来谈话时，他手里还拿着一本“反人民的阴谋”。他对费尔顿夫人说：
    “听说你去年回到英国，政府要处你叛国罪。可是根据这书上的定义，违背人民的才叫叛国罪。应该受到这种惩罚的正是我们国家的统治阶级自己。而你却是做了对人民有益的工作。”
    一提到细菌战，奎恩就垂下了眼皮。他说他所有参加过细菌战的朋友，都感到可耻！感到罪不可赦！可是他们所受的待遇却是出乎意料的。他感激地说：
    “不管我们做了多少罪恶，志愿军却叫我们学到很多东西。过去人家说我反动，我一点也不懂，现在却是耳目口鼻全张开了。我热爱中国，更热爱苏联……。你是有机会告诉西方人民：中国人民是在做着怎样伟大的工作的……。”
