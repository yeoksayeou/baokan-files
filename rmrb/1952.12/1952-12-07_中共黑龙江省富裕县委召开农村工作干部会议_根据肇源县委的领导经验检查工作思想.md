The CCP Fuyu County Committee of Heilongjiang Province Convenes Rural Work Cadre Meeting: Examining Work Ideology Based on the Leadership Experience of Zhaoyuan County Committee

On October 22nd, the CCP Fuyu County Committee of Heilongjiang Province convened a rural work cadre meeting to discuss how to learn from and promote Zhaoyuan County's bumper harvest experience. Everyone examined their own thinking in comparison to the leadership style of Comrade Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee. Some cadres from peasant backgrounds had always believed that they were "old farmers" with many years of farming experience, understanding everything about planting, and there was nothing to learn. They also believed that yields had a certain limit; the average harvest was four or five *shi*, and with a little technology, it could be increased by one or two *shi* at most, and no further increase was possible. These comrades were conservative in their thinking, paid no attention to the masses' bumper harvest experiences, and of course, did not consider researching and analyzing the masses' experiences. Sui Lianyou, Secretary of the Seventh District Committee, who came from a peasant background, said: "I used to be in the countryside all day, but I never seriously studied ways to increase production. I thought: just plant when planting, hoe when hoeing, there is nothing great about it, so I never went deep into reality like Comrade Ren Guodong, relying on the masses to study their experiences. After this study, my thinking is clear, and I must study the masses' experiences well in the future." Cadres from intellectual backgrounds strengthened their mass viewpoint at this meeting and resolved to delve into the production process to learn agricultural technology. Jiang Chengxin, Secretary of the Third District Committee, said: "In the past, I talked a lot of theory in my work, but I couldn't solve specific problems. When launching the summer hoeing competition, I wasn't very confident myself and thought the masses were conservative and wouldn't be able to do it, so I was anxious. Either I adopted overly simple methods, or I complained that the leaders set the slogans too high. Now I realize I was wrong. In the future, I must go deep among the masses and rely on them to do a good job." Nie Chun, Deputy Secretary of the First District Committee, said: "In the past, I didn't see the masses as true heroes, and I didn't understand technology myself. When I mobilized the masses to plow in the autumn, the masses asked me: how can we plant after plowing in the autumn, and I didn't know. In the future, I must study hard, summarize the masses' experiences well, and learn and promote Zhaoyuan's bumper harvest experience." Some cadres who knew some new technologies believed that they understood scientific things and were better than the masses, so they did not pay attention to discovering and summarizing the masses' experiences. When technology could not be implemented, they indiscriminately labeled the masses as "conservative" and said they were backward. They rarely did in-depth and meticulous propaganda and organization work. As Comrade Yang Zhenxing, Head of the Agricultural Science Section, said: "In the past, I thought the masses were conservative and didn't understand agricultural technology, so I didn't go deep into my work. When I went to the countryside, I just passed through. Zhaoyuan's experience shows that I actually had conservative ideas and didn't believe in the ability of the masses. This has given me a sharp criticism."

Chen Junsheng, Acting Secretary of the County Committee, said: "Although our county also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, completing 109 percent of the production plan, with a total output exceeding 53 percent of that in 1951, and a unit area yield reaching 165 percent of that in 1951; from the perspective of the leaders themselves, our work is still far behind, there is still a great deal of blindness, and we still lack a keen sense of new things. Especially myself, in the past, I led production from outside production, and did not conduct much investigation and research. Although I can 'mingle with' the masses, I cannot discover problems, and many problems cannot be solved. In the future, we should learn from four aspects: (1) Use Zhaoyuan's experience to correct our own work style of not going deep enough, formalism, and cursory observation, oppose being satisfied with generalized work arrangements, and oppose the attitude of thinking that everything is 'ordinary.' (2) We must use our brains more to think about problems. In the past, we also grasped some situations, but we didn't study and analyze problems enough with our brains, so we couldn't discover new problems. In the future, we must study from the small, ordinary, and detailed problems, and repeatedly study and analyze them, so as to further discover more new problems and new experiences. (3) Comrades who have some theoretical knowledge and agricultural knowledge should make good use of this knowledge in practice, and should reverse the work style of not believing in the masses, not going deep among the masses, and not relying on the masses. We should recognize that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Only in this way can we better discover more valuable experiences. (4) In our work, we must find the main contradictions and grasp the main key. It is not enough to only grasp the technical problems in our work. It was wrong that we did not combine the production increase movement and the mutual aid and cooperation movement well in the past."

This meeting decided: on the one hand, to learn from Zhaoyuan County's bumper harvest experience, and on the other hand, to summarize and study our county's bumper harvest experience. The County Committee should select four villages for key investigation, comprehensively, meticulously, and completely summarize the bumper harvest experiences of these villages, and find out the experience of the bumper harvest competition. Each district committee secretary should personally take charge of one village, summarize local experience, and promote Zhaoyuan County's experience, to prepare conditions for the universal learning and promotion of Zhaoyuan's bumper harvest experience this winter.

    中共黑龙江省富裕县委召开农村工作干部会议
    根据肇源县委的领导经验检查工作思想
    中共黑龙江省富裕县委在十月二十二日召开了农村工作干部会议，讨论怎样学习和推广肇源县的丰产经验。大家对照中共肇源县委书记任国栋同志的领导作风，检查了自己的思想。有些农民出身的干部，一向认为自己是种地多年的“老庄稼人”，种地那一套都明白，没啥可学习的。他们还认为产量是有一定限度的，一般的收获四石、五石，加上一点技术，多收一石、两石，也就到头了，再要增产是不可能的。这些同志的思想是保守的，对群众的丰产经验是不注意的，当然谈不到研究分析群众的经验了。农民出身的第七区区委书记隋连有说：“我过去整天在农村，从没有很好地研究过增产办法。我想：种地就种吧，铲地就铲吧，没啥了不起，所以从来就没有像任国栋同志那样深入实际，依靠群众，来研究群众的经验。经过这次学习，思想通了，今后一定要好好地钻研群众的经验。”知识分子出身的干部，在这次会议上加强了群众观点，决心深入生产过程学习农业技术。第三区区委书记姜成新说：“我过去在工作中讲道理多，碰见具体问题解决不了。在开展夏锄竞赛的时候，自己信心不大，还认为是群众保守，搞不起来便着急，不是采用过于简单的方式，就是埋怨领导方面口号提得太高。现在是越想越不对。今后一定要深入群众，依靠群众搞好工作。”第一区区委副书记聂纯说：“过去没把群众看做是真正的英雄，自己又不懂技术。我动员群众秋翻地，群众问我：秋翻地过年怎么种，我就不知道。今后一定要好好学习，好好地总结群众的经验，并学习和推广肇源的丰产经验。”有些知道一些新技术的干部，认为自己懂得科学的东西，比群众强，因而就不注意去发现和总结群众的经验。当技术贯彻不下去的时候，就不分青红皂白地给群众扣上个“保守主义”的帽子，说群众落后。他们很少深入地细密地做宣传和组织工作。正如农业科科长杨振兴同志说的：“我过去认为群众保守，不懂得农业技术，工作没深入，下乡也只是一走一过。肇源的经验说明实际是我自己有保守思想，不相信群众的能力。这给予我一个尖锐的批判。”
    县委代理书记陈俊生说：“我县今年虽然也取得了历史上空前的丰收，完成了生产计划的百分之一百零九，总产量超过了一九五一年的百分之五十三，单位面积产量达到一九五一年的百分之一百六十五；但从领导者本身来讲，我们的工作还是差得很远，还有很大的盲目性，对新鲜事物还很缺乏锐敏的感觉。特别是我自己，过去是站在生产之外来领导生产，调查研究不多。虽然也能和群众‘打成一片’，但发现不了问题，有好多问题解决不了。今后我们应当从四方面来学习：（一）用肇源的经验纠正我们自己工作不深入、形式主义、走马观花的工作作风，反对满足于一般化的布置工作，反对认为什么东西都是‘平平淡淡’的态度。（二）要多用脑子思考问题。过去我们也掌握了一些情况，但用脑子研究分析问题不够，便发现不了新的问题。我们今后要从一点一滴的平凡的细小的问题钻研起，反复研究分析，以便进一步发现更多的新问题和新经验。（三）有一些理论知识和农业知识的同志，要很好地把这些知识运用到实际中去，要扭转过去不相信群众，不深入群众，不依靠群众的工作作风，应认识到群众的智慧是无穷无尽的。只有这样，才能更好地发掘出更宝贵的经验。（四）在工作中要找出主要矛盾，抓住主要关键。只抓工作上的技术问题是不行的。我们过去没有很好地把增产运动和互助合作运动结合起来，就是不对的。”
    这次会议决定：一方面要学习肇源县的丰产经验，另一方面也要总结研究本县的丰产经验。县委要选择四个村子进行重点调查，要全面地、细致地、完整地总结这些村子的丰产经验，并找出丰产大评比的经验。各区区委书记要亲自掌握一个村，总结本地经验和推广肇源县的经验，给今冬普遍地学习推广肇源的丰产经验准备好条件。（于景章）
