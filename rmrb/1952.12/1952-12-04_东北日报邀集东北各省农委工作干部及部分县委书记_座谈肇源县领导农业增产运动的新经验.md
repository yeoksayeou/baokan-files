The Northeast Daily Invites Agricultural Commission Cadres from Northeast Provinces and Some County Party Secretaries to Discuss New Experiences in Zhaoyuan County's Leadership in the Agricultural Production Increase Campaign

On November 5th, the editorial department of the Northeast Daily invited over 30 comrades, including responsible comrades from the Rural Work Committees of the Provincial Committees of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in various provinces of the Northeast, and some county party secretaries, who were in Shenyang to attend the Northeast Bureau Rural Work Conference of the CPC Central Committee, to hold a symposium to discuss the new experiences in the Zhaoyuan County production increase campaign in Heilongjiang Province.

During the symposium, many comrades pointed out that the experience of Zhaoyuan County's production increase campaign greatly encouraged the confidence and enthusiasm of rural work cadres in leading agricultural production work, especially strengthening the confidence in increasing the total value of agricultural production in the Northeast by 80% to 100% within five years. Wang Zhao, a comrade from the Rural Work Committee of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee, said: "After the publication of the new experience of the Zhaoyuan County production increase campaign, the confidence of provincial and county leaders in doubling the total value of agricultural production after five years has become more firm; at the same time, it has also strengthened the confidence in promoting Lan Guohuan's high-yield wheat experience in an organized manner throughout Songjiang Province. Although we had considered doing this in the past, we always thought it was very difficult and not easy to promote. The fact that Zhaoyuan County created a large area of high yield makes us more capable and confident in promoting Lan Guohuan's high-yield wheat experience."

Many comrades' speeches focused on explaining that the new experience of Zhaoyuan County's production increase campaign is not simply the promotion of a new technology for increasing production, but more importantly, the application of the mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses." Most comrades also made inspections in connection with the actual work situation in the areas they lead, and unanimously pointed out that the important significance of Zhaoyuan's new experience in increasing production lies in this. A Yingga, secretary of the Yi County Party Committee of the CPC Liaoxi Provincial Committee, said: "It is wrong to think, purely from a technical point of view, that the experience of the Zhaoyuan production increase campaign cannot be promoted in areas with different conditions from Heilongjiang Province. This is a working method of summarizing and promoting the experiences of the masses by going deep into the masses. In the past, Yi County did have high yields, but we did not pay enough attention to these experiences of the peasants, and we did not seriously go deep down to summarize them, so that what could be promoted was not promoted. In the past, we did whatever the higher-ups told us to do, and summarized our work according to the work arrangements, without paying attention to the experiences created by the masses." Wang Jiping, a comrade from the Rural Work Committee of the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee, said: "In the past, we also summarized experiences, but these so-called 'experiences' were mostly generalized experiences, so the effect was not great. Experiences must have specific content to be effective." Jiang Runwu, secretary of the Dongfeng County Party Committee of the CPC Liaodong Provincial Committee, talked about how to learn and summarize experiences: "In the past, we learned more experiences from newspapers and leaders, and less from going deep down to summarize the experiences of peasants. In fact, the experiences of peasants are very rich. The so-called 'summary' is only a 'summary' for the higher-ups, not for promotion, so it cannot be promoted."

From the new experience of Zhaoyuan's production increase campaign, the comrades present connected it to the issue of rural work cadres mastering agricultural technology, and unanimously agreed that only by mastering agricultural technology can work be non-generalized and specific. Comrade Zeng Yu from the Rural Work Committee of the CPC Liaodong Provincial Committee said: "It is not enough to lead agricultural production solely by political leadership. We must change this working method of leading solely by political propaganda and education, and specifically strengthen technical guidance. Therefore, in the future, we should learn to master agricultural technology, learning from books on the one hand, and more importantly, learning from farmers, and only by learning technology can we change the generalized leadership style." Wang Zhao, a comrade from the Rural Work Committee of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee, said: "Farmers urgently need to improve agricultural technology, but the leadership cannot propose specific ways to improve technology. When some comrades went to the countryside to call on farmers to soak seeds in warm water this spring, the farmers asked how to soak them, but our cadres could not say. As a result, the farmers boiled the seeds in boiling water for half an hour, and the seeds were cooked, and they came to complain to our cadres. Many district and village cadres feel very distressed because they do not have technical experience. They ask county cadres for solutions, but county cadres cannot meet their requirements because they have not learned or summarized. In this way, leadership is bound to be generalized. The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee went deep into the masses to master the technical experience of the masses, and then concentrated it and taught it to the masses. This is what we should learn well."

In their speeches, everyone unanimously agreed that the experience of Zhaoyuan County proves that the experience of increasing production must be summarized by going deep into the masses, and promoted among the masses, and at the same time, we must learn to master technology. This is the key to overcoming the generalization of agricultural production leadership. The Secretary of the Ningcheng County Party Committee of the CPC Rehe Provincial Committee also proposed that it is necessary to grasp the key experiences of increasing production and promote them according to the different characteristics of each region.

Comrade Ren Guodong, Secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee of the CPC, also made a speech at the meeting. After briefly narrating his own experience, he said that to promote the experience of high yield, the mutual aid and cooperation movement must keep up, and technical guidance must also keep up. In short, the leadership must keep up. This year, Zhaoyuan County has not done enough in this regard. In addition, he introduced the preparations being made this winter to organize cadres and the masses to learn new farming methods in order to further promote the experience of high yield next year.

### 东北日报邀集东北各省农委工作干部及部分县委书记  座谈肇源县领导农业增产运动的新经验

　　东北日报邀集东北各省农委工作干部及部分县委书记
    座谈肇源县领导农业增产运动的新经验
    十一月五日，东北日报编辑部邀集在沈阳参加中共中央东北局农村工作会议的中共各省省委农村工作委员会负责同志及部分县委书记三十余人举行座谈会，座谈黑龙江省肇源县增产运动的新经验。
    座谈中，不少同志指出：肇源县增产运动的经验大大地鼓舞了农村工作干部领导农业生产工作的信心和热情，特别是提高了在五年之内将东北农业生产总值提高百分之八十至一百的信心。中共松江省委农村工作委员会王钊同志说：“肇源县增产运动新经验发表之后，使省、县领导同志对五年之后农业生产总值提高一倍的信心更加坚定；同时也坚定了在松江全省有组织地推广蓝国焕小麦丰产经验的信心。过去虽然也曾考虑过这样做，但是一直认为很困难，不易推广。肇源县创造大面积高额产量的事实使我们推广蓝国焕小麦高额产量经验更加有办法，有把握。”
    许多同志的发言都着重说明：肇源县的增产新经验不单是推广了一种新的增产技术方法，而更重要的是运用了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的这种群众路线的工作方法。大多数同志并联系自己所领导的地区的实际工作情况做了检查，同时还一致指出：肇源增产运动新经验的重要意义就在于此。中共辽西省义县县委书记阿英嘎同志说：“单纯从技术上看，认为肇源增产运动经验在与黑龙江省条件不一样的地区就不能推广是不对的。这是一种总结群众经验并加以推广的深入群众的工作方法。义县在过去并不是没有出现高额产量，但对农民这些经验注意不够，没有认真地深入下去加以总结，这样就使能够推广的未加推广。过去的工作是上边怎样招呼，我们就怎招呼么，按照工作布置总结工作，没有注意群众所创造的经验。”中共吉林省委农村工作委员会王季平同志说：“过去我们也总结过经验，但那所谓‘经验’大都是一般化的经验，因之效果不大。经验必须有具体的内容，才能起作用。”中共辽东省东丰县委书记蒋润吾同志谈到怎样学习、总结经验时说：“过去从报纸上和领导方面学习经验多，深入下去总结农民经验少，实际上农民中的经验非常丰富。所谓‘总结’只是对上‘总结’，不是为了推广，因之也就不能推广。”
    与会同志从肇源增产运动的新经验，联系谈到农村工作干部掌握农业技术问题，一致认为：唯有掌握了农业技术，工作才能不一般化，才能具体。中共辽东省委农村工作委员会曾予同志说：“领导农业生产单凭政治领导是不够的，必须改变这种单凭政治宣传教育领导的工作方法，而要具体地加强技术指导。因之，今后就应该学习掌握农业技术，一方面向书本学，同时更重要的，还要向农民学，学会了技术，才能转变一般化的领导作风。”中共松江省委农村工作委员会王钊同志说：“农民迫切地需要改进农业技术，但领导方面又提不出具体改进技术的办法。今年春耕时有的同志下乡号召农民温汤浸种。农民问怎样浸法，我们干部却说不出来。结果，农民用开水煮了半个钟头，种籽都煮熟了，就来埋怨我们的干部。不少区村干部因为没有技术经验而感到很苦恼，向县干部要办法，而县干部因为没学习，也没总结，也不能满足他们的要求。这样，领导必然一般化了。肇源县委深入群众掌握了群众技术经验，集中起来之后又教给群众，这是我们应该很好学习的。”
    大家发言中一致认为：肇源县的经验证明，增产经验必须深入到群众中去总结，并去群众中加以推广，同时还要学习掌握技术，这是克服农业生产领导一般化的关键。中共热河省宁城县委书记并提出：必须根据各地不同特点，抓住对带关键性的增产经验加以推广。
    中共肇源县委书记任国栋同志在会上也做了发言，在简单叙述了自己的体会后，他说要推广丰产经验，互助合作运动必须跟上去，技术指导也必须跟上去，总之，领导必须跟上去。今年肇源县在这方面还是做得不够的。此外，他又介绍了今冬组织干部、群众学习新耕作法，为明年进一步推广丰产经验而进行的准备工作的情况。
