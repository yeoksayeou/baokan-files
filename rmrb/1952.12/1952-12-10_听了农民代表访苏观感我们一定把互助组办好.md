    After Hearing the Impressions of the Farmer Representatives' Visit to the Soviet Union, We Must Run the Mutual Aid Teams Well
    Editor: I was extremely happy to hear the impressions of the members of the Chinese Farmer Representative Delegation's visit to the Soviet Union. After finishing work, no matter how tired I am, as soon as the Soviet collective farm is mentioned, my spirits rise.
    I have two and a half *mu* of land and a family of four. This year, I joined the mutual aid team. In the patriotic production increase competition, I improved my skills and harvested more grain. I was thinking: life is good enough, no need to develop further. In the spring, the district cadres said that we should develop towards a happy socialist society like the Soviet Union, where farmers live in good houses, use electric lights, and farm with machines. At the time, I was puzzled, could such a good thing be possible? Then someone said that at that time, it won't be divided into yours and mine, and working won't be divided into good or bad, it would be just like a big family. This made my head feel like a pot of paste, I couldn't figure it out. Later, I heard the Secretary of the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party talk about the socialist vision, calling on us to organize and follow the bright road pointed out by Chairman Mao, so that we could have a happier life in the future. A crack opened up in my head. However, I still didn't understand what a socialist society was really like. This time, after hearing what our own representatives said, it was like opening two doors, very bright. I realized that if we want to live a socialist life, we must organize, from mutual aid teams to agricultural producers' cooperatives, and then develop into collective farms. This year, I led a small mutual aid team of seven households, and we deeply realized the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. For example, last year, the average yield per *mu* was only five *shi* of grain, but this year it was more than eight *shi*. Now that we know the living conditions of the members of the Soviet collective farm, our confidence in following the bright road pointed out by Chairman Mao is even stronger. This year, we have implemented autumn plowing, accumulated enough manure for ten *mu* of land, and selected good seeds. We must run the mutual aid team even better next year.

    听了农民代表访苏观感我们一定把互助组办好
    编辑同志：我听了中国农民代表参观团团员报告的访苏观感，心里高兴极了。干完活，不管多累多乏，只要一讲苏联集体农庄，精神就来了。
    我有两垧半地，一家四口人，今年加入了互助组，在爱国主义丰产竞赛运动中，改进了技术，多打了粮食。我就盘算着：小日子够过啦，用不着再往前发展啦。春天区干部说，我们还要发展到像苏联那样幸福的社会主义社会去，农民要住好房，用电灯，种地使机器。当时我还纳闷，那有这个好事？又有人说，到那时也不分你，也不分我，干活也不分好坏，反正就像一大家子。这么一来，我脑袋就像一盆浆子似的，想不通。后来，又听中共区委书记讲社会主义远景，号召组织起来，走毛主席指给的光明大道，将来过更幸福的生活。我脑袋窍了一点缝。可是社会主义社会到底是啥样子，还是不摸底。这回听了自己的代表们的话，就像开开两扇门一样的亮堂了。我认识了要想过社会主义的生活，就必须组织起来，由互助组到农业生产合作社，再发展为集体农庄。我今年领导了一个有七户人家参加的小型互助组，我们深深体会到了互助合作的好处。比如去年平均每垧地只打五石多粮，今年就打了八石多。现在我们知道了苏联集体农庄庄员的生活情形，走毛主席指给的光明道路的信心更坚定了。今年我们实行了秋翻地，积了能上十垧地的粪，还选好了良种。我们明年一定要把互助组办得更好。
