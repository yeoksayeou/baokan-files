International Briefs

    American Financiers are Extremely Afraid of Peace
    American financiers are extremely afraid of peace, including talk about peace. The "Business Daily" recently said that talk about the possibility of a ceasefire in Korea has caused prices on the speculative commodity stock exchange to fall. The November 28th issue of "Business Week" stated more bluntly: "A truce would almost certainly bring about the business recession that people have been predicting." "Business Week" went on to say that a truce would not cause a major change in the American military program, but "the reasons for critical timing would be less convincing. In this way, employers who are no longer worried about the lack of goods will no longer be busy buying goods. As a result, price levels and markets will be tested. The business decline may come sooner and be more profound than originally expected. The failure of efforts to seek a ceasefire could be a stimulant."
    This is why American financiers are so hostile to peace and are doing their best to continue the Korean War.

    Turkey's Medical Conditions are Appalling
    The Turkish newspaper "Milliyet" reported: The conditions in Ankara's so-called "model" state hospital are very bad. There is only one bed for every three patients, and some patients are lying on dirty mattresses on the floor of the corridor. Patients eat unsanitary and spoiled food.
    The newspaper pointed out: "Generally speaking, the situation is this: patients not only cannot recover in the hospital, but their conditions will deteriorate."
    Anyone who understands the situation knows that this is similar to the economic situation of the "model" country Turkey, which is bound by the U.S. "aid" trap.

    The Life of the People of Puerto Rico is Extremely Miserable
    The main "living conditions" of the people of Puerto Rico, which has been turned into a colony by the United States, are unemployment, hunger, disease, and a high mortality rate.
    According to the Uruguayan newspaper "Debate": Out of the island's 2.3 million people, 400,000 are unemployed. 125,000 people suffer from tuberculosis and cannot get medical treatment. A large number of people suffer from other diseases, including 82,000 mentally disordered people wandering in urban and rural areas. 400,000 children are deprived of the possibility of going to school.
    The American ruling group is forcing others to accept this kind of "American way of life."

    国际简讯
    美国财阀极端害怕和平
    美国财阀极端害怕和平、包括关于和平的谈论在内。“商务日报”最近说，关于朝鲜停火的可能性的谈论使得投机商品证券交易所的价格低落。十一月二十八日“商业周刊”更直率地说：“停战会使人们所预言的企业衰退几乎一定会到来。”“商业周刊”接着说，停战不会使美国军备计划有重大的改变，但是“时机危急的理由就不那么有说服力了。这样，不再为货物缺乏担忧的顾主们就不会再忙于购买货物了。结果，价格水平和市场就会遇到考验。企业衰落可能比较原来预料的来得更早，更深刻。谋求停火的努力的失败可以成为一服刺激剂。”
    这也就是美国财阀这样仇视和平并竭力想继续朝鲜战争的原因。
    土耳其的医疗条件恶劣不堪
    土耳其报纸“密里叶特报”报道：安卡拉的所谓“模范”国家医院的条件非常恶劣。每三个病人只有一张病床，有些病人就躺在走廊地板上的肮脏的褥子上。病人吃着对卫生有害的腐败食物。
    该报指出：“一般说来，情况是这样的：病人在医院里不但不能痊愈，病状反而会恶化下去。”
    明白事理的人一看就知道：这和被束缚在美“援”圈套中的“模范”国家土耳其的经济情况差不多。
    波多黎各人民生活悲惨已极
    被美国变成它的殖民地的波多黎各人民的主要“生活条件”就是失业、饥饿、疾病和高度的死亡率。
    据乌拉圭“辩论报”报道：在岛上二百三十万人口中有四十万人失业。十二万五千人患有结核病而得不到医药治疗。有大量人民患有其他的疾病，包括在城乡中漂泊的八万二千名神经错乱的人。四十万儿童被剥夺了求学的可能性。
    美国统治集团就是把这种“美国生活方式”强迫别人接受的。
