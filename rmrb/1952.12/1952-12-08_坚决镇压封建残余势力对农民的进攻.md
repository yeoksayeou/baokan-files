    Resolutely Suppress the Remnant Feudal Forces' Attacks on Peasants

    The cases in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, such as the beating to death of martyr Zhang Sanyuan, though different in form, are essentially attacks on peasants by the rural remnant feudal forces colluding with counter-revolutionaries. The fact that such things happened after the nationwide large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries should arouse high vigilance and serious attention.

    As early as 1949, at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao warned us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. After the pacification of the whole country, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore themselves in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, without any doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." However, some state workers have forgotten Chairman Mao's instructions, were overwhelmed by victory, and developed a sense of peace and complacency. They did not see that the remnant feudal forces and counter-revolutionaries had usurped the leadership of the village governments and mass organizations under their leadership, and were secretly or even openly attacking and framing peasants. They turned a deaf ear to the people's appeals and accusations, found various excuses to delay and prevaricate, and failed to deal with them for a long time, allowing conspirators to run rampant; even based on the facts fabricated by conspirators, they accused the victims of being illegal elements, arbitrarily detained, controlled, and even beat them to death, helping landlords and rich peasants to seize the land and houses distributed to peasants. The existence of such a group of bad workers and bad work styles is the main reason why serious cases such as the beating to death of Zhang Sanyuan occurred, and why they could not be resolved for a long time after they occurred. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government severely punished this group of bad workers and conspirators who counter-attacked the peasants, and specially held a meeting to summarize the experience and lessons of these three cases, which is completely correct.

    Our country is about to begin large-scale economic construction, and one of the important guarantees for large-scale construction is a consolidated people's democratic government and good social order. Every revolutionary worker should once again learn a lesson from these three cases, overcome the idea of peace and complacency and the bureaucratic style of not investigating and not studying, eliminate the phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline, severely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, and maintain the purity of state organs and all mass organizations.

### 坚决镇压封建残余势力对农民的进攻

    坚决镇压封建残余势力对农民的进攻
    山西省临汾县所发生的烈属张三元被打死等三个案件，虽然形式各有不同，但本质上都是农村的封建残余势力勾结反革命分子对农民进行反攻。这样的事情发生在全国大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动以后，值得引起高度警惕和严重注意。
    早在一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上，毛主席就曾经告诫我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”但是某些国家工作人员却忘记了毛主席的这一指示，被胜利冲昏了头脑，滋长了和平麻痹思想。他们看不见封建残余势力和反革命分子篡夺了他们领导下的村政权和群众组织的领导权，在那里秘密地甚至公开地打击和陷害农民。他们对于人民的申诉和控告充耳不闻，找寻各种藉口推拖敷衍，长期不予处理，听任阴谋分子横行；甚至以阴谋分子捏造的事实作依据，给受害人加上不法分子的罪名，擅自扣押，管制，以至打死，帮助地主、富农抢夺农民分得的土地、房屋。这样一批恶劣的工作人员和恶劣作风的存在，就是张三元被打死等严重案件所以发生、发生以后又长期不能解决的主要原因。中共山西省委和山西省人民政府严厉地惩罚了这批恶劣的工作人员和向农民反攻的阴谋分子，并专门召开会议来总结这三个案件的经验教训，是完全正确的。
    我们的国家即将开始大规模的经济建设，大规模建设的重要保证之一是巩固的人民民主政权和良好的社会秩序。每一个革命工作人员都应该从这三个案件中再一次吸取教训，克服和平麻痹思想和不调查不研究的官僚主义作风，扫清无组织无纪律的现象，严厉地镇压一切反革命活动，保持国家机关和一切群众组织的纯洁性。
