    Japan's Two Major Peaceful and Democratic Groups Merge to Strengthen the Peace Front
    Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace Defines Current Tasks of the Peace Movement
    Xinhua News Agency: The Presidium of the Japanese All-Round Peace and Patriotic Movement Council issued a statement on November 4 regarding the strengthening of the peace front, announcing the decision to merge the council with the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace.
    The statement said: Since its establishment in January 1951, the All-Round Peace and Patriotic Movement Council has consistently struggled for independence, peace, and freedom. The nationwide signature campaign initiated by the council, "Demanding an All-Round Peace Treaty and Opposing Rearmament," collected six million signatures. In addition, the council's campaign against the vicious laws suppressing patriotic and peace movements forced the Yoshida government to withdraw the "Organizations Control Law"; the council supported the general strike against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and prevented domestic and foreign reactionaries from using the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" unscrupulously.
    The statement emphasized: More importantly, through these movements, cooperation across all strata of the people, regardless of party affiliation, and unified action from the bottom up were achieved. This achievement will certainly play a role in the future.
    The statement pointed out: Facts have proven that the anti-war movements in various colonial countries cannot but conflict with the imperialist policies of establishing military bases in the colonies and using colonial youth as mercenaries, and the peace movement cannot but be combined with the national independence movement. This point has been affirmed by the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We should also incorporate this into our organizational policy. We have now reached this stage. Therefore, the Presidium of the Council decided at its meeting on October 31 to accept the request of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace and merge with the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace.
    The statement put forward the future direction of the peace movement as follows: 1. Focusing the peace movement on demanding the conclusion of an all-round peace treaty, the abolition of military bases, and the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Japan; 2. Combining the peace movement with the people's daily demands and raising it to a conscious patriotic peace movement; 3. Separately launching movements against rearmament and promoting trade, etc., and merging them with the movement to strive for peace and independence to form a broad united front.
    The statement finally called on all groups and individuals who support the All-Round Peace and Patriotic Movement Council to support and participate in the future movements and organization of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace.
    Furthermore, the Secretariat of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace issued a public statement on November 17, announcing the tasks of the current peace movement as decided by the meeting: According to the policy of the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, peace conferences should be held in each prefecture to implement the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and, combined with local conditions, make them a people's movement; combined with the movements such as "Opposing Conscription, Inappropriate Security Forces, and Providing Youth with Employment," rallies against sending troops to Korea should be held throughout the country with the participation of people from all walks of life, in order to force the Japanese government to guarantee that it will not send troops, and call on the "Security Forces" to oppose sending troops to Korea.
    The meeting also decided that the peace movement should be combined with the workers' struggle for increased wages and year-end bonuses, and unite small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, hold various symposiums, oppose raising national railway freight rates, rice prices, and gas fees, and promote Sino-Japanese trade. In order to launch a peace movement during the upcoming New Year period, the meeting decided to widely launch a peace New Year card movement and issue New Year peace posters, hold New Year peace dinners, peace forums, etc., so that the slogans and program of the peace movement can penetrate into the masses.
    In addition, the meeting also put forward a policy of expanding and strengthening the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace's newspaper "Peace News" (formerly the organ of the All-Round Peace and Patriotic Movement Council, "Peace Treaty News") and the peace movement organization, calling for the establishment of peace committees in every village, town, factory, mine, school, and institution.
    The Secretariat's announcement declared Ikuo Oyama as the President of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace, Gitaro Hirano as the Secretary-General, and the heads of the Secretariat also included Yashiro Ii, Shoji Ogata, Kenjuro Yanagida, and Tokusaburo Awa.

    日本两大和平民主团体合并以加强和平战线
    日本拥护和平委员会确定当前和平运动任务
    据新华社讯：日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会的主席团在十一月四日发表了一篇关于加强和平战线的声明，宣布该协议会与日本拥护和平委员会合并的决定。
    声明说：全面媾和爱国运动协议会自一九五一年一月成立以来，即始终不渝地为独立、和平与自由而斗争。协议会所发起的全国规模的“要求全面媾和、反对重整军备”的签名运动征集了六百万个签名。此外，协议会所提倡的反对镇压爱国与和平运动的恶毒法令的运动，迫使吉田政府不得不撤回“团体等规正法”；协议会支援了反对“防止破坏活动法”的大罢工，并使国内外反动派不能肆无忌惮地使用“防止破坏活动法”。
    声明强调说：更重要的是，通过这些运动，获得了各阶层人民不分党派的合作与自下而上的统一行动。这种成果将来一定会发生作用。
    声明指出：事实证明：各殖民地国家中反对战争的运动不能不和帝国主义在殖民地建立军事基地、以殖民地青年为雇佣兵的政策发生冲突，和平运动不能不和民族独立运动结合起来。这一点已为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所肯定。我们也应把这一点吸收到组织方针里来。现在我们已经到达了这个阶段。因此，协议会主席团在十月三十一日的会议上决定接受日本拥护和平委员会常任委员会的要求，与日本拥护和平委员会合并。
    声明提出今后和平运动的方针为：一、以要求缔结全面和约、取消军事基地与撤退外国驻日军队为和平运动的中心；二、和平运动与人民日常的要求相结合，并使之提高为有意识的爱国和平运动；三、分别展开反对重整军备、促进贸易等运动，而与争取和平独立的运动汇合成为一条广泛的统一战线。
    声明最后号召一切支援全面媾和爱国运动协议会的团体与个人都支援并参加日本拥护和平委员会今后的运动和组织。
    又讯：日本拥护和平委员会书记处在十一月十七日发表公报，宣布会议所决定的当前和平运动的任务为：根据日本和平联络委员会的方针，在各府各县召开和平大会，以贯彻亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议，并结合地方的情况使之成为人民运动；结合“反对征兵、不当保安队、给青年以职业”等运动，在全国各地召开有各阶层人民参加的反对出兵朝鲜大会，以迫使日本政府保证不出兵，并号召
    “保安队”反对出兵朝鲜。
    会议并决定：和平运动应与工人的要求增加工资和年终津贴的斗争相结合，并团结中小企业家，召开各种座谈会，反对提高国营铁道运费、米价和煤气费，推进日中贸易。为了在即将到来的新年期间展开和平运动，会议决定广泛发动和平贺年片运动和发行新年和平招贴画，举行新年和平聚餐会、和平座谈会等，以使和平运动的口号和纲领深入群众。
    此外，会议并提出了扩大和加强日本拥护和平委员会机关报“和平新闻”（原为全面媾和爱国运动协议会的机关报“媾和新闻”）与和平运动组织的方针，号召在每一村镇、厂矿、学校、机关成立和平委员会。
    书记处公告宣布大山郁夫为日本拥护和平委员会会长，平野义太郎为总书记，书记处的负责人还有伊井弥四郎、尾形昭二、柳田谦十郎、淡德三郎等人。
