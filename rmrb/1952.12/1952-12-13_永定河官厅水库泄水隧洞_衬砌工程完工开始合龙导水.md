    Yongding River Guanting Reservoir Drainage Tunnel
    Lining Project Completed, Starts Closure and Water Diversion
    The drainage tunnel project, one of the main projects of the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir, has been lined and completed, and closure and water diversion have begun. The workers are now actively excavating the dam foundation and rushing to build the dam, striving to enable the reservoir to intercept floods before the flood season next year.
    The lining project of the drainage tunnel was fully completed on November 20, with a total of 100,260 cubic meters of stone excavation and 24,595 cubic meters of earth excavation, and 13,200 cubic meters of concrete poured. In order to ensure the quality of the project, workers and engineering technicians displayed high labor enthusiasm and created many new working methods, which saved 15 kilograms of cement per cubic meter of concrete, saving more than 1,000 tons of cement in total, and increased the compressive stress per square centimeter from 186 kilograms to more than 200 kilograms, improving the quality of the project. In the arch sealing work of the tunnel lining, initially only 2 cubic meters of concrete could be poured by 80 to 90 people per shift per day. Later, the workers of the Fourth Detachment of the Concrete Engineering Team held a "Zhuge Liang" meeting and created a "multi-hole, multi-channel feeding method," which increased work efficiency by 104 percent.
    The Guanting Reservoir project started in October last year. The drainage tunnel was broken through on June 10 this year. After the lining project of the tunnel is completed, more than 12,000 workers on the construction site are now working hard in the freezing weather to excavate the dam foundation and rush to build the dam. The workers will also carry out projects such as the water intake tower (used to control the drainage volume of the tunnel) and the stilling basin (used to eliminate the kinetic energy of the water flowing out of the tunnel).

    永定河官厅水库泄水隧洞
    衬砌工程完工开始合龙导水
    永定河官厅水库主要工程之一的泄水隧洞工程已衬砌完工，开始合龙导水。工人们现正积极开挖坝基赶筑大坝，争取在明年伏汛前使水库可以拦蓄洪水。
    泄水隧洞的衬砌工程在十一月二十日全部完工，共开石方十万零二千六百立方公尺和挖土方二万四千五百九十五立方公尺，浇灌混凝土一万三千二百立方公尺。为了保证工程质量，工人和工程技术人员发挥高度的劳动热情，创造了不少新的工作方法，使每立方公尺混凝土所需水泥节省十五公斤，共节省水泥一千多吨，同时使每平方公分面积的抗应压力从一百八十六公斤增加到二百公斤以上，提高了工程质量。在隧洞衬砌的封拱工作中，最初每天每班八九十人才打两公方混凝土，后来混凝土工程队第四中队工人召开“诸葛亮”会，创造“多孔多道进料法”，把工作效率提高百分之一百零四。
    官厅水库工程是去年十月开工的。泄水隧洞在今年六月十日凿通。隧洞的衬砌工程完成后，现在工地上一万二千多工人正在冰天雪地里紧张地开挖坝基赶筑大坝。工人们并将进行进水塔（用以控制隧洞泄水量）和静水池（用以消灭隧洞出口流水动能）等工程。（新华社）
