    Suggest the Fenyang County People's Court Inspect the Implementation of the Marriage Law
    Comrade Editor: Ma Fengjin, a woman from Xincun, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, divorced her husband, Zhang Deheng, who she had been arranged to marry by her parents. In the summer of this year, she freely fell in love and married Wu Yingjiang, who was in the same mutual aid team. Zhang Deheng harbored resentment and attempted to kill Ma and Wu. One evening in the seventh month of the lunar calendar this year, Fengjin and Yingjiang were returning to the village from the fields when they suddenly saw Zhang Deheng running towards them fiercely with a sickle in his hand. Seeing the bad situation, Yingjiang put down his farm tools and embraced Zhang. Zhang slashed at Yingjiang with the sickle, but he couldn't muster enough strength, so Yingjiang was fortunately not injured. Fengjin cried for help, and Zhang was pulled away by passersby. That night, the village people's government sent Zhang to the district people's government, who then sent him to the county people's court. Fengjin also went to the court. However, Li Kaiji, a judge of the court, did not interrogate Zhang, but instead scolded Fengjin: "Did Zhang Deheng hit you? Did he cause bruises or swelling? You are making trouble out of nothing!" As a result, Fengjin was sent back to the village. Jia Huanxing, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in the village, the village head, and the director of the women's federation were dissatisfied with this matter and immediately held meetings of party members and cadres to discuss it. Everyone believed that the free marriage of Fengjin and Yingjiang should be actively supported, and Zhang Deheng's criminal behavior should be appropriately punished. The village cadres repeatedly requested the county people's court to handle the matter, but the court ignored them. The village cadres continued to report to the county, saying: "If the county people's court doesn't resolve this, we will write an article to the Shanxi Daily to criticize them!" Only after this did the county people's court and the county women's federation jointly go to Xincun to understand the situation and detain Zhang. But this issue has not yet been finalized.
    I believe that the spirit of actively implementing the Marriage Law by cadres such as Jia Huanxing of Xincun, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, is commendable and worthy of promotion. But why does Judge Li Kaiji of the county people's court have such an old legal viewpoint that disregards the interests of the people and condones criminals? I suggest that the county people's court handle this incident quickly and appropriately, and thereby inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    建议汾阳县人民法院检查执行婚姻法的情况
    编辑同志：山西汾阳县辛村妇女马凤金，与原由父母包办结婚的丈夫张德恒离婚后，于今年夏天和在同一互助组里的武应江自由恋爱结婚。张德恒怀恨在心，企图杀害马、武二人。今年农历七月初的一天晚上，凤金和应江从地里回村途中，突见张德恒手拿镰刀凶狠地对面跑来。应江见情况不好，就放下农具把张抱住。张用镰刀向应江乱砍，但却使不上劲，所以应江幸未受伤。凤金急声呼救后，张才被路人拉开。当晚，村人民政府把张犯送区人民政府再转送县人民法院。凤金也同到法院。可是，该院审判员李开吉不讯问张犯，反而只斥责凤金：“张德恒打伤你啦？人家打你青伤啦，还是红肿啦？你是没事找事！……”结果，把凤金碰回村去。村中中共支部书记贾焕星、村长和妇联会主任等对这事不满，当即分别召开党员会、干部会讨论。大家认为，对凤金和应江的自由结婚应该积极支持，张德恒的犯法行为应该受到适当制裁。村干部即几次地要求县人民法院处理，该院一直不管。村干部又继续向县里反映说：“如果县人民法院再不给解决，我们就要向山西日报写稿批评啦！”这样以后，县人民法院才和县妇联会联合到辛村了解情况并把张犯扣捕起来。但这问题到现在还没有作最后处理。
    我认为，山西汾阳县辛村干部贾焕星等积极贯彻婚姻法的精神是应该的，值得发扬的。但该县人民法院审判员李开吉为何有这样漠视人民利益、纵容罪犯的旧法观点？建议该县人民法院对这一事件迅速、适当地处理，并从而检查贯彻婚姻法的情况。
