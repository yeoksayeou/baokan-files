    National Cooperatives Actively Support Agricultural Production
    Overfulfill This Year's Task of Supplying Commercial Fertilizer
    As of the end of October, cooperatives across the country have overfulfilled their 1952 commercial fertilizer supply tasks. Cooperatives supplied a total of 2.22 million tons of oil cake, completing 104.5% of the original plan; and supplied 310,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, completing 122.04% of the original plan. The cooperatives' fertilizer supply work has strongly supported the patriotic agricultural production increase campaign and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. According to surveys on fertilizer application and increased production in typical counties and cities such as Dezhou, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Hangxian, Weixian, and Dongguang, these commercial fertilizers can increase the value of grain and cash crops by a total of 7 trillion yuan.
    This year, cooperatives adopted a business method of locally purchasing raw materials, processing them locally, and supplying them locally, supplemented by long-distance allocation, thus reducing fertilizer costs and supplying them to farmers in a timely manner. Cooperatives in various regions also correctly grasped the operating principle of "expanding cash sales and reducing credit sales," with cash sales accounting for 79% and credit sales accounting for 21%, which relatively saved state funds and expanded the fertilizer business volume. In addition, cooperatives in some regions have focused on developing the business of depositing money in advance for fertilizer (i.e., farmers pay a deposit for fertilizer first and pick it up on a regular basis), absorbing the masses' own funds and solving the difficulties of insufficient funds for cooperatives. This method is also worth promoting.
    In the process of managing fertilizers, cooperative cadres have achieved considerable results in increasing production and practicing economy by establishing business accounting thinking. All regions have adopted the method of shipping directly from ship to ship and from truck to truck to various retail outlets, which greatly reduced loading, unloading, and warehousing costs and the fertilizer loss rate. However, some regions have also discovered phenomena of losses to state property and increased costs due to poor planning and improper storage, which must be improved.
    In 1953, cooperatives will supply 3.14 million tons of bean cake and 410,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, a task that is even more important than this year. In order to successfully achieve this plan, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives requires cooperatives at all levels to: First, resolve the issue of oil cake raw materials locally as much as possible, and strive to control 65% of the required raw materials; increase the establishment of necessary fertilizer processing plants, and organize private processing plants to process on their behalf, and strive for the above-mentioned processing plants to start work this winter by more than 80%. Second, continue to vigorously develop the business of depositing money in advance for fertilizer. Next year, strive for the portion of depositing money in advance to account for 15% to 20% of the total operating funds, and this task must be completed by more than two-thirds in winter.

    全国合作社积极支援农业生产
    超额完成今年供应商品肥料的任务
    全国各地合作社一九五二年的商品肥料供应工作，到十月底为止，已经超额完成。合作社共供应油饼二百二十二万吨，完成原订计划的百分之一百零四点五；供应化学肥料三十一万吨，完成原订计划的百分之一百二十二点零四。合作社供应肥料工作，有力地支援了农业爱国丰产运动，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。根据德州、石家庄、天津、杭县、潍县、东光等典型县、市地区的施肥增产调查推算，这些商品肥料共可增产价值七万亿元的粮食和经济作物。
    今年合作社供应肥料，采取了就地收购原料，就地加工，就地供应，辅以远地调拨的经营方法，因而降低了肥料成本，及时地供应到农民手中。各地合作社并且正确地掌握了“扩大现售，缩小赊销”的经营方针，现售额占百分之七十九，赊销额占百分之二十一，这就相对地节约了国家资金，扩大了肥料的经营额。此外，若干地区的合作社还重点地开展了存实预售肥料业务（即农民先付购肥定金，定期取货），吸收群众自有资金，解决合作社资金不足的困难，这种办法也是值得提倡的。
    合作社干部在经营肥料过程中，由于树立起企业核算思想，在增产节约上取得了不小的成绩。各地都采取了船拨船，车拨车，直接运到各零售网的办法，大大减少了装卸、仓储费用和肥料的损耗率。但若干地区也发现了因计划不周、保管不善而使国家财产遭受损失，增高了成本的现象，这是必须注意改进的。
    一九五三年合作社将供应豆饼三百一十四万吨和化学肥料四十一万吨，这一任务比今年更为重大。为顺利实现这一计划，全国合作总社要求各级合作社：第一，尽量在本地解决饼肥原料，争取掌握所需原料的百分之六十五；增办必要的肥料加工厂，并组织私营加工厂代为加工，争取上述加工厂今冬开工百分之八十以上。第二，要继续大力开展存实预售肥料业务。明年争取存实预售部分要占全部经营资金的百分之十五到二十，这一任务在冬季须完成三分之二以上。
