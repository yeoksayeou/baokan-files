In order to implement the economic accounting system, the organizational structure of the state-owned department store company system in East China has been changed, and wholesale department store stations have been established. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station, the department store purchasing and supply wholesale stations in major cities of East China, and the state-owned department stores within the supply range of these department store purchasing and supply wholesale stations have been established successively, and some systems have been initially established. The superiority of the state-owned department store company system in implementing the economic accounting system can be seen in the process of establishing purchasing, wholesale, and supply stations and establishing department stores. Regarding the saving of funds alone, according to the most conservative estimate from the East China Regional Provincial and Municipal Department Store Managers Conference held in November, after the implementation of the economic accounting system, the funds of department stores throughout the region can be reduced by one-third. In order to strengthen the station establishment work in various places, the East China Company of the China Department Store Company has transferred more than 100 cadres from the district company and provincial branch companies to focus on learning the economic accounting system, so that they can be sent to various places to specifically help with the station establishment work.

    华东区国营百货公司
    建立百货批发站
    为了实行经济核算制，华东区国营百货公司系统已改变组织机构，建立百货批发站。上海采购供应站和华东区各主要城市的百货采购供应批发站，以及这些百货采购供应批发站供应范围内的国营百货商店已相继建立，并初步建立一些制度。在建立采购、批发、供应站和建立百货商店的过程中可以看出国营百货公司系统实行经济核算制的优越性。仅节省资金一项，据十一月间举行的华东区各省、市百货公司经理会议最保守的估计，实行经济核算制后，全区百货公司资金可以缩减三分之一。为加强各地建站工作，中国百货公司华东区公司已抽调区公司及各省分公司干部一百多人集中学习经济核算制，以便派到各地去具体帮助建站工作。
