The Great Stalin Constitution
Soviet Union, Zawaidski

In his historic report "On the Draft Constitution of the USSR" at the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets on November 25, 1936, Comrade Stalin summarized the vast experience of the struggle to build the first socialist country in human history, made the most profound analysis of socialism, and enriched Marxist-Leninist theory with the most important conclusions and principles about socialist society. The great leader of the working people explained that the new constitution "will be a document of historical significance, which, in simple and clear language, almost in the style of a record, states the fact that socialism has triumphed in the Soviet Union, the fact that the working masses of the Soviet Union have been liberated from capitalist slavery, and the fact that the most thorough democracy has triumphed in the Soviet Union." (Russian edition of "Problems of Leninism," p. 572)

On December 5, 1936, the Congress of Soviets unanimously approved the fundamental law of the socialist state—the Constitution of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people proudly call it the Stalin Constitution in honor of its creator.

For centuries, humanity has dreamed of a free, creative life, of a good life without slaves and rulers. This glorious and joyful life has been realized in one-sixth of the earth thanks to the great October Socialist Revolution. The October Revolution opened a new era in the history of mankind and produced an unprecedented democratic system, namely, a Soviet socialist democracy for the working people, fundamentally different from bourgeois democracy. This revolution not only gave the working people true freedom, but also material happiness and the possibility of a prosperous and cultured life.

Due to the implementation of the wise Lenin-Stalin policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the Soviet Union completed a huge historical leap from backwardness to progress. Stalin's Five-Year Plans fundamentally changed the face of the country, turning it into a powerful socialist power. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union and the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution transformed Soviet democracy from a democracy for the vast majority of residents into a democracy for all, that is, a democracy for the entire people.

The Stalin Constitution legislatively solidified the great rights of Soviet citizens, which the Soviet people won under the leadership of the Communist Party in the heroic struggle against the enemies of socialism and against all the old, declining, and dark forces of the world.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of workers and peasants. The advanced working class leads the state and society. All power in the Soviet Union belongs to the working people of town and country, and is exercised by the Soviets of Working People's Deputies, which constitute the political foundation of the USSR.

The fundamental difference between Soviet democracy and bourgeois democracy lies in the fact that in bourgeois countries, actual power belongs to a tiny ruling exploiting class in society, and the members of the government and its policies are determined by the largest monopoly capitalists—steel magnates, coal magnates, oil magnates, etc.

In the Soviet Union, the exploitation of man by man has been eliminated forever. The socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the instruments and means of production form the solid economic foundation of Soviet society. A new socialist economy has been established. This new socialist economy not only knows no crises and unemployment, poverty and bankruptcy of the working masses, but also guarantees the continuous growth of the people's material well-being and cultural level.

The victory of socialism has changed the class composition of Soviet society: the working class and the entire people have jointly become the owners of the instruments and means of production; the Soviet peasants are advancing along the Stalinist path of collective farms; and a new Soviet intelligentsia, closely connected with the people, has grown up, dedicating their creative labor and potential courage to the people. In Soviet society, the socialist principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" has been proclaimed and implemented.

In the Soviet Union, genuine people's power has been realized. The Stalin Constitution guarantees genuine equality of rights to all citizens, without any incidental clauses reducing the rights of this or that resident. The great Stalin taught that what determines a citizen's position in society is not property, not national origin, not gender, not profession, but only each citizen's individual abilities and personal labor.

The policy of the Lenin-Stalin Party has guaranteed the true political and economic equality of women, and has ensured the introduction of millions of female workers and peasant women into the ranks of active fighters for socialism.

One of the most significant achievements of socialism—equality of rights among nationalities and races, without any discrimination, and the unbreakable friendship of the free peoples—is specifically expressed in the Constitution. The Constitution is based on the premise that all nationalities and races, regardless of their past and present circumstances, regardless of their numbers and level of development, should enjoy equal rights in all areas of economic, social, state, and socio-cultural life.

The Stalin Constitution is the embodiment of expanded socialist democracy, and it legislatively consolidates the historical achievements of the Soviet people, such as the right to work, the right to rest, the right to education, and the right to material security in old age and in the event of loss of working ability.

No one can suppress the voice of the Soviet people, because the press does not belong to the capitalists but to the working people. In the Soviet Union, freedom of speech and freedom of the press are manifested in the unreserved and free unfolding of criticism.

According to the Stalin Constitution, elections to all state power organs—from rural and urban Soviets to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR—are based on universal, equal, and direct suffrage, conducted by secret ballot. Soviet citizens truly participate in resolving national issues and in deciding the policies of the Soviet state and the path of development of Soviet society.

Unlike the constitutions of bourgeois countries, the Soviet Constitution is not limited to formal provisions of citizens' rights, but guarantees these rights. Every Soviet citizen feels the reality of the rights and democratic freedoms granted to him truly every day and every hour.

Soviet citizens enjoy great rights guaranteed by the Stalin Constitution; the duty of Soviet citizens is to abide by Soviet laws, observe labor discipline, cherish and protect socialist property, observe the rules of socialist public life, and defend the motherland from enemy invasions.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have carried out revolutionary reforms of worldwide historical significance, becoming a great example of unprecedented productive forces. Even in the pre-war years of several Stalinist Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced, powerful, industrial-collective farm power. After concluding the war provoked by the fascists with a historic victory, the Soviet Union, in a short period of time, relying on its own strength and resources, without foreign aid, restored the economy destroyed by the war and moved it forward.

Due to the successful completion of the post-war Stalinist Five-Year Plan, in 1950 Soviet industrial production exceeded the pre-war level by 73 percent. Now, the vast industry of the Soviet state produces in nine days the equivalent of the production in one year before the October Revolution in Russia. The total grain harvest in 1952 was eight billion poods. The Soviet Union's grain problem has been successfully solved, thoroughly and irrevocably. After the war, the Soviet people began the great construction of communism and began to transform nature.

The national income, which is entirely the wealth of the working people, is constantly growing. Last year's national income exceeded the pre-war 1940 level by 83 percent. During the same period, the total income of workers, staff, and peasants increased by 78 percent.

The peoples of the Soviet Union have realized a true cultural revolution. 57 million people are studying in various schools and training classes. In France, only 36 out of every 10,000 people study in higher education institutions, in Italy there are 32, in Denmark there are 34, in Egypt and Turkey there are about 12, while in Soviet Azerbaijan there are 93 out of every 10,000 people studying in higher education institutions, and in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic there are 71.

The Soviet Union has raised healthcare to an unprecedented level. For example, in Soviet Georgia there is one doctor for every 373 people, while in France there is one doctor for every 1,000 people, and in Egypt there is one doctor for every 4,350 people.

The basic economic law of socialism, discovered and scientifically demonstrated by Comrade Stalin, is expressed in the draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the USSR (Fifth Five-Year Plan) for 1951-1955. The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism are: "To ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole of society by means of continuously increasing and perfecting socialist production on the basis of high technology."

The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates the further upsurge of all sectors of the national economy of the victorious socialist country, the further upsurge of the living standards and culture of the working people, and thus enables us to take a new big step on the road from socialism to gradual transition to communism.

At the same time, in capitalist countries, the basic law of capitalism discovered by Comrade Stalin is in effect: to ensure maximum capitalist profit by exploiting the majority of the population of one's own country and making them bankrupt and impoverished, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially backward countries, and by means of wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring maximum profits. In capitalist countries, the relative and absolute impoverishment of the working class is intensifying; the living standards of the working people are falling year by year; the number of unemployed is increasing dramatically; and education remains, as before, the privilege of the propertied class.

In his historic speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin pointed out that the bourgeoisie no longer has even a shadow of liberalism. "So-called 'individual freedom' no longer exists - now, only those who have capital are recognized as having individual rights, while all other citizens are treated as human raw materials suitable only for exploitation. The principles of equality of human rights and equality of nationalities are trampled on; these principles have been replaced by the principle that the exploiting minority enjoys full rights while the exploited majority of citizens has no rights. The banner of bourgeois-democratic freedom has been thrown aside. I think it is you, the representatives of the communist and democratic parties, who will have to raise this banner and continue to advance with it if you want to unite the majority of the people around you. No one but you will raise this banner."

The camp of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the Soviet Union is constantly strengthening and consolidating, while the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism, torn by deep internal contradictions, surrounded by the indignation of the broad masses of the people, is increasingly declining.

The Soviet Constitution is an indictment against fascists, reactionaries, and modern warmongers.

The Soviet Constitution is an invincible historical testament to socialism and democracy.

In the great struggle for lasting peace, democracy, and socialism, the people of the world see in the Stalin Constitution the embodiment of their hopes and draw new strength from the Constitution.

    伟大的斯大林宪法
    苏联　扎瓦德斯基
    斯大林同志于一九三六年十一月二十五日在非常第八次全苏联苏维埃代表大会上“论苏联宪法草案”的历史性报告中，总结了争取建设人类历史上第一个社会主义国家斗争的巨大经验，对社会主义作了最深刻的分析，以关于社会主义社会最重要的结论和原理丰富了马克思列宁主义理论。劳动人民的伟大领袖说明了新宪法“将是一个有历史意义的文件，它用简单明了的语句，几乎是用记录的体裁，来说明社会主义在苏联胜利的事实，来说明苏联劳动群众摆脱资本主义奴隶制度而得到了解放的事实，来说明扩展的最彻底的民主制在苏联胜利的事实。”（俄文版“列宁主义问题”第五百七十二页）
    一九三六年十二月五日，苏维埃代表大会一致批准了社会主义国家的基本法——苏联的宪法，苏联人民为了尊重宪法的创制者而骄傲地把它称为斯大林宪法。
    人类对自由的创造性的生活，对没有奴隶和统治者的生活的善良的想望，已梦想了好多世纪了。这种光辉的和愉快的生活，由于伟大的十月社会主义革命，在地球上六分之一的地方实现了。十月革命打开了全世界人类历史上的新纪元，并产生了从所未见的民主制度，即对劳动人民的民主制度，根本异于资产阶级民主的苏维埃社会主义的民主制度。这个革命使劳动人民不仅获得了真正的自由，而且也得到了物质的幸福，得到了富裕的和文化的生活的可能性。
    由于英明的列宁—斯大林的国家工业化和农业集体化的政策的实现，苏联完成了从落后到进步这一巨大的历史性的跃进。斯大林的五年计划根本改变了国家的面貌，把国家变成了强大的社会主义强国。社会主义在苏联的胜利，斯大林宪法的颁布，把苏联的民主从绝大多数居民的民主变成了全民的民主，即对全体人民的民主。
    斯大林宪法在立法上巩固了苏联公民的伟大权利，这些权利是苏联人民在共产党领导下与社会主义的敌人，与世界上一切旧的衰老的黑暗势力的英勇斗争中争取到的。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟是工农社会主义国家。先进的工人阶级实现了国家对社会的领导。苏联全部政权属于城乡劳动人民，由构成苏联的政治基础的劳动人民代表苏维埃实现之。
    苏联的民主与资产阶级的民主的根本区别就在于：在资产阶级国家里，实际的政权是属于社会中为数极少的统治的剥削阶级，而且政府的成员及其政策都为最大的垄断资本家——钢铁大王、煤炭大王、石油大王等所决定。
    在苏联永远消除了人对人的剥削。社会主义的经济制度和生产工具及生产资料的社会主义所有制，成为苏维埃社会的坚固的经济基础。新的社会主义经济建立起来了。新的社会主义的经济不仅不知道危机和失业、劳动大众的贫困和破产，而且也保证了人民的物质幸福和文化水平的不断增长。
    社会主义的胜利改变了苏维埃社会的阶级构成：工人阶级和全体人民共同成为生产工具和生产资料的所有者，苏联农民沿着斯大林集体农庄道路前进，与人民血肉相连的新的苏维埃知识分子成长起来了，他们把自己的创造性的劳动和潜在的勇敢精神，都贡献给人民。在苏维埃的社会里，“不劳动者不得食”的社会主义的原则，宣布了而且付诸实现。
    在苏联实现了真正的人民政权。斯大林宪法为全体公民保证了权利的真正平等，它没有减缩这种或那种居民权利的任何附带条款。伟大的斯大林教导说，决定一个公民在社会中的地位的，不是财产，不是民族的出身，不是性别，不是职业，而只是每个公民的个人才能和个人劳动。
    列宁—斯大林党的政策保证了妇女的真正的政治上的和经济上的平等，保证了把千百万的女工和农民妇女引进到争取社会主义的积极战士的队伍中去。
    社会主义最显著的成果之一——民族和种族的平权，没有任何的歧视，自由各族人民的牢不可破的友谊，具体地表现在宪法中。宪法所持的出发点是：各民族和各种族不分过去和现在的情况，不分数量和发展的水平，都应当在经济、社会、国家和社会文化生活的各领域中享有同样的权利。
    斯大林宪法就是扩展的社会主义的民主主义的体现，它在立法上巩固了苏联人民这些历史性的成果，如劳动权、休息权、受教育权、年老和丧失了劳动能力时有享受物质保证权。
    任何人都不能压制苏联人民的声音，因为报刊不是属于资本家而是属于劳动人民的。在苏联，言论自由和出版自由表现在展开不顾情面地自由批评方面。
    根据斯大林宪法，一切国家政权机关的选举——从农村和城市苏维埃到苏联最高苏维埃——都是基于普遍平等直接选举制，用秘密投票法进行的。苏联公民真正参加了解决全国性的问题，参加了决定苏维埃国家政策和苏维埃社会发展道路的事业。
    异于资产阶级国家宪法的苏联宪法，并不为公民的形式上的权利规定所限制，而是保证这些权利。每个苏联公民每天每时都会真实地感觉到赋予他的权利和民主自由的现实性。
    苏联公民享有伟大的，为斯大林宪法所保证的权利；苏联公民的职责，是要遵守苏维埃的法律，遵守劳动纪律，爱惜和保护社会主义的财产，遵守社会主义公共生活规则，保卫祖国免于敌人的侵扰。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下实现了具有全世界历史意义的革命改革，成为全世界空前未见的生产力发展的伟大范例。还在战前几个斯大林五年计划的年代中，苏联就从落后的农业国变成了先进的、强大的、工业—集体农庄的强国。在以历史性的胜利结束了为法西斯分子所挑起的战争后，苏联在短时期内，依靠着自己的力量和资财，没有外援，恢复了为战争所破坏的经济而且把它向前推进了。
    由于成功地完成战后的斯大林五年计划，一九五○年的苏联的工业生产超过了战前水平的百分之七十三。现在，苏维埃国家的庞大工业，每九天的生产量，就相当于俄国十月革命前夕一年期间的生产量。一九五二年的谷物收获总额为八十亿普特。苏联的粮食问题顺利地解决了，彻底而无可改变地解决了。战后，苏联人民开始进行伟大的共产主义建设，着手改造大自然。
    完全是劳动人民财富的国民收入，在不断地增长。去年的国民收入超过了战前一九四○年水平的百分之八十三。同一期间内，工人、职员和农民的收入总额增加了百分之七十八。
    苏联各族人民实现了真正的文化革命。各种学校和训练班里有五千七百万人学习。在法国每一万人中只有三十六人在高等学校读书，在意大利有三十二人，在丹麦有三十四人，在埃及和土耳其约有十二人，而在苏维埃阿塞拜疆一万人中就有九十三个人在高等学校学习，在乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国有七十一人。
    苏联把保健事业提到空前的高度。如在苏维埃格鲁吉亚每三百七十三人就有一个医生，而在法国一千人才有一个医生，在埃及四千三百五十人有一个医生。
    为斯大林同志所发现的和科学论证的社会主义的基本经济法则，表现在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示草案中。社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    第五个五年计划规定胜利了的社会主义国家的国民经济一切部门的进一步高涨，规定劳动人民生活水平和文化的进一步的高涨，因之能够使我们在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路上迈进新的一大步。
    同时，在资本主义国家，为斯大林同志所发现的资本主义的基本法则在发生作用：用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。在资本主义国家里，工人阶级的相对的和绝对的贫困化在加剧；劳动人民的生活水平年复一年地下降；失业人数在急剧地增加；仍像从前一样，教育是有产阶级的特权。
    斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的历史性的演说中指出，资产阶级连一点自由主义的影子也没有了。“所谓‘个人自由’已经不再存在了——现在，仅仅那些有资本的人们才被承认有个人权利，而所有其他的公民则被当作是只适于供剥削的人类原料。人权平等和民族平等的原则被践踏了；这种原则已代之以从事剥削的少数人享有充分权利而公民中被剥削的大多数人则毫无权利的原则。资产阶级——民主的自由这种旗帜已经被抛在一边了。我认为，正是你们，共产主义和民主的政党的代表们，将必须举起这面旗帜，打着它继续前进，如果你们希望把大多数人民团结在你们周围的话。除你们以外，再没有人会举起这面旗帜。”
    苏联所领导的和平、民主和社会主义阵营不断地强大和巩固，同时，为深刻的内部矛盾所撕裂着的、为广大人民群众激愤所包围着的、以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营则日益衰落。
    苏联的宪法是反对法西斯、反动派和现代战争贩子的起诉书。
    苏联宪法是社会主义和民主不可战胜的历史性的证据。
    在为争取持久和平、民主和社会主义所展开的巨大的斗争中，全世界人民在斯大林宪法中看到自己希望的体现，在宪法中汲取到新的力量。
