    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai Cables UN General Assembly President
    Strongly Protesting U.S. Crimes on Beehive Island
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 21st] Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, cabled Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, on December 21, lodging a strong protest against the heinous crime of the U.S. military on Beehive Island in which eighty-seven captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side were killed and one hundred and twenty were wounded, a crime that completely destroyed the principles of humanity and fundamentally violated the Geneva Convention. The text of the cable is as follows:

    Mr. Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly:

    On December 14, 1952, just after the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, passed the illegal resolution on the Korean question based on the Indian proposal, the U.S. military committed a massacre in the POW camp on Beehive Island, killing eighty-seven captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side and wounding one hundred and twenty people. The number of POWs massacred reached the highest peak of the number of POWs massacred that the U.S. side has been forced to admit over a long period of time.

    The Beehive Island massacre is not only an expansion and development of the U.S. military's consistent policy of massacring POWs, but also a result of direct encouragement by the United Nations General Assembly's passage of the aforementioned illegal resolution. This incident once again fully demonstrates that the actual content of the so-called U.S. principle of "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" is to coerce POWs to express "unwillingness to be repatriated" through inhuman collective massacres, in order to achieve its goal of forcibly detaining POWs.

    The entire Chinese people express extreme indignation at the U.S. military's planned and inhuman massacre of POWs. I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, lodge a strong protest against the U.S. military's heinous crime of completely destroying the principles of humanity and fundamentally violating the Geneva Convention, and demand that the United Nations General Assembly immediately take effective measures to stop the U.S. military's barbaric atrocities of killing Korean and Chinese POWs, and severely punish the U.S. officials who bear full responsibility for this and past bloody massacres.

    In view of the fact that the aforementioned illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly has already caused such serious criminal consequences, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the United Nations General Assembly should accept the suggestion I made in my reply cable to you on December 14, 1952, cancel the aforementioned illegal resolution, order the U.S. government to immediately resume the Panmunjom armistice negotiations, and implement a comprehensive ceasefire based on the draft Korean armistice agreement that has already been reached, and then hand over the issue of the complete repatriation of POWs to the "Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question" proposed by the Soviet delegation to resolve. Only in this way can the POW massacre be immediately stopped and the Korean armistice be immediately realized.

    周恩来外长电联大主席
    严重抗议美国在蜂岩岛的罪行
    【新华社二十一日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于十二月二十一日致电联合国大会主席皮尔逊，对美国军队在蜂岩岛打死朝中方面被俘人员八十七人、打伤一百二十人的彻底摧毁人道原则、根本破坏日内瓦公约的罪恶行为，提出严重抗议。电文如下：联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生：
    一九五二年十二月十四日，联合国大会在美国操纵下根据印度提案刚刚通过了关于朝鲜问题的非法决议之后，美国军队又在蜂岩岛战俘营中制造了打死朝中方面被俘人员八十七人，打伤一百二十人的大屠杀案；被屠杀的战俘人数之多，达到了美方长期以来历次被迫承认的屠杀战俘数字的最高峰。
    蜂岩岛的大屠杀案，不仅是美国军队一贯屠杀战俘政策的扩大和发展，而且是在联合国大会通过上述非法决议的直接鼓励之下造成的。这个事件，又一次充分地证明了美国所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”原则的实际内容，就是用惨无人道的集体屠杀来胁迫战俘表示“不愿遣返”，以便达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    全中国人民对于美国军队有计划地灭绝人性地屠杀战俘的暴行表示极端愤慨。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府对于美国军队这种彻底摧毁人道原则、根本破坏日内瓦公约的罪恶行为，提出严重抗议，并要求联合国大会立即采取有效措施，制止美国军队杀害朝中战俘的野蛮暴行，严厉惩处对这次以及过去历次血腥屠杀事件负有全部责任的美国官员。
    鉴于联合国大会所通过的上述非法决议案业已造成了这样严重的罪恶结果，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，联合国大会应该接受我在一九五二年十二月十四日给你的复电中所提出的建议，取消上述非法决议，责成美国政府立即恢复板门店停战谈判，并根据已经达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，实行全面停战，然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交给苏联代表团所建议的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决。只有这样，才能使战俘屠杀事件立即终止，朝鲜停战立即实现。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
    一九五二年十二月二十一日于北京
