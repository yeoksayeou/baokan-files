    A young couple - Ren Xiaoqun and Wang Shunying
    Wang Qing
    Husbands and wives have the obligation to love, respect, help, and support each other, to live in harmony and unity, to engage in labor and production, to raise children, and to strive together for family happiness and the construction of a new society.
    —Excerpt from Article 8, Chapter 3 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China
    North of the Dasha River in Lushan County, Henan Province, there is a village called Shengou Village. In this village lives
    a very close young couple. The man is named Ren Xiaoqun, who is twenty-two years old, and the woman is named Wang Shunying, who is eighteen years old. This young couple is praised by the masses and cadres of the entire village and township. At the Lushan County Model Conference for Implementing the Marriage Law at the end of October this year, the representatives and models also rated them as a first-class model couple.
    The love story of Wang Shunying and Ren Xiaoqun is not complicated. Shunying's family lived in Balixiang in the Tenth District. On the sixteenth day of the first lunar month in 1951, her mother asked Shunying to pick up her older sister to stay at her mother's house. Shunying's older sister is named Shufan, who is married to Shen Shitou of Shengou Village. As soon as Shunying entered her sister's house, she happened to meet Xiaoqun. Actually, Shunying and Xiaoqun had known each other since they were children, but they had never spoken. Later, as they grew up, Shunying admired Xiaoqun's honesty and competence, his skillful hands and meticulousness; Xiaoqun also felt that none of the young women in the nearby villages could compare to her. But in the old society, unmarried men and women were blamed for even saying a word to each other. The two had to keep their feelings hidden. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, both had plans. This time when they met, although both felt their hearts racing and their faces flushing, they talked for most of the day. From the conversation, Shunying learned that Xiaoqun was a member of the Communist Youth League, the village militia captain, and a model student; Xiaoqun also learned that Shunying was a member of the Communist Youth League, a good student, and the chairman of the village women's federation. Both were also active participants in the land reform movement. With a foundation from the past and progress after liberation, the two revealed to each other their willingness to marry during the conversation.
    When Shunying returned home, her mother saw the joy on her daughter's face. When asked, Shunying told the truth. Her mother had lived a lifetime and never heard of free love, feeling that her daughter had no parents in her eyes, and said angrily:
    "You found your own match? That won't do!" Shunying wanted to make a scene with her mother; but then she thought that her father died early, her older sister was already married, and her mother usually loved her the most, so she should try to persuade her first. Shunying said, "Mom, after liberation, Chairman Mao led us to turn over, divided the land, and now promulgated the Marriage Law, all for our own good. You arranged a marriage for my sister, and the couple is not harmonious, my sister is beaten and bullied every day. Every time she comes back, she cries, and you cry with her, aren't you worried? I found a good partner myself, and I promise not to worry you." After persuading her for a long time, her mother actually changed her mind and agreed to Shunying: "Go as you wish, but don't blame me later!" When Xiaoqun returned home, he told his mother all his joy. His mother was a sufferer. For three generations before Xiaoqun's father, they didn't have an inch of land or a tile, and they rented land from landlords to make a living, the hardships were endless. At that time, the men of the landlord's family, no matter if they were blind or crippled, could marry three or five wives. In Wangzhuang Township, Eight District, there was a landlord who married six wives. But for the children of poor families, no matter how talented they were, it was difficult to marry a wife. Xiaoqun was outstanding in everything among the young people of the same age, but he was already more than five feet tall, and no one had ever proposed a marriage for him. His mother had long been hoping to have a grandson, and was very happy when she heard what Xiaoqun said. At that time, Xiaoqun's family only had three people, his father was over sixty years old and often suffered from heart pain, so he didn't care much. His two older brothers had separated and lived their own lives a few years ago. His mother agreed, so the whole family agreed.
    Half a month later, Shunying came to her sister's house again. After that conversation, Xiaoqun came here every day, hoping to meet Shunying and have a deep talk. This time when they met, they talked about what had happened since they parted and their future plans, and that was considered engagement. Later, they met a few more times, and even watched a play and had dinner together at the Dongcun temple fair.
    Xiaoqun and Shunying's love had different reactions among the masses in Shengou Village. Young women felt that the Marriage Law was really good, and they could control their own destiny and would no longer be manipulated by others to "marry a chicken" or "marry a dog." They spoke louder; when they met Xiaoqun on the road, they would laugh and play for a while. Several unmarried young people found Xiaoqun and said that they wanted to join the militia, strive to join the League, and work actively, so that they could find their own partners in the future like Xiaoqun. The older men and women, although they didn't like it and gossiped, saying that Xiaoqun and Shunying were "not afraid of being embarrassed," they didn't dare to come forward to stop them because the cadres supported them. There were also people who wanted to sabotage it. For example, Shufan's mother-in-law originally wanted to be a matchmaker and arrange for Shunying to marry her sister's son, but now that she saw the situation was not good, she returned to her mother's house (living in the same village as Shunying), and fabricated to Shunying's mother how Xiaoqun's work was not active and how short he was, etc., and was rebutted by Shunying's mother before she gave up her original idea.
    At this time, Chairman Mao's determination to "be sure to harness the Huai River" reached here. The local people's government called on the masses to participate in harnessing the Huai River. This made Xiaoqun feel difficult. If he didn't sign up, he was now a party member and it was his duty; if he signed up, his father's heart pain had recurred, and his mother was also sick. Although the villagers could take care of them after he left, how convenient could that be? He went to Shunying to discuss it. The laborers in Balixiang were also signing up. Not knowing where Shunying heard that Xiaoqun hadn't signed up, she was full of anger. As soon as they met, they almost quarreled. Xiaoqun patiently explained the situation. Shunying asked, "What should we do then?" After studying for a long time, they felt that the only way to get married and have Shunying take care of the family was the best solution. But at that time, Shunying was seventeen years old and not old enough to get married. Finally, they decided that Xiaoqun must participate in the second batch of laborers to harness the Huai River next spring.
    The following year, which is this year, on the twenty-sixth day of the first lunar month, Shunying and Xiaoqun held a wedding ceremony with a new ritual. In early February of the lunar calendar, the township held a second registration meeting for laborers to harness the Huai River. Xiaoqun had long been unable to restrain himself, and he was also very remorseful - he shouldn't have put the country's affairs behind the family's last time, and his parents' illness had soon improved. He had told Shunying what he meant, and Shunying agreed with his view. At this registration meeting, he was the first to sign up. Before leaving, Shunying carried his backpack and saw him off for a distance, telling him not to worry about the family; Xiaoqun also told Shunying to work and labor well at home.
    More than a month after Xiaoqun left, one night, Shunying and the women of the same village went to Dongcun to watch a play. The play was called "Lei Laoqi and Lei Laoliu Harness the Huai River." The play showed the story of the two going to and returning from harnessing the Huai River together, Lao Liu became a model, and Lao Qi was rated as a loafer. While watching the play, Shunying thought of Xiaoqun, and on the way back, she was full of thoughts about "model" and
    "loafer." When she got home, it was late, Shunying lay on the bed, and soon fell asleep. In her dream, Shunying saw Xiaoqun push the door open and come in, with a drooping head and dull eyes. Shunying asked, "Is the Huai River harnessed!" Xiaoqun said, "No. I miss home, so I ran back." Immediately, Shunying became angry: "What did you say when you left? Didn't you promise to go home only after harnessing the Huai River well? Go back! Otherwise, I won't be in your house anymore!" Xiaoqun refused to leave, and Shunying cried angrily. Her mother-in-law lived next door, and heard Shunying crying in the middle of the night, not knowing what grievances her daughter-in-law had suffered, she put on her clothes and got out of bed and came over to wake up Shunying. Shunying woke up and knew it was a dream, but she couldn't fall asleep no matter how hard she tried.
    The next day, Shunying hurriedly finished breakfast, ran out and found Teacher Yuan at the school, and asked him to write a letter to Xiaoqun, encouraging Xiaoqun to harness the Huai River well and not to miss home.
    Xiaoqun's construction site was in Baisha Town, Yuxian County. Xiaoqun's class was a soil transportation class, with a total of fifteen people in the class, and he was the class leader. Nine classes were a middle team, and there were twenty or thirty militiamen in the middle team. Everyone elected Xiaoqun as the captain to protect the safety of the laborers. Before coming, Xiaoqun had been working hard, always being the first. The cart of soil he pushed was always full. On rest days, he led the people in the class to help the military families in nearby villages carry manure and urine (for fertilizer), and harvest crops. The local people told him how the evil waters of the Huai River had flooded people, land, and houses in those years. Xiaoqun knew the suffering of the people of Henan from the floods. He also thought of the painful experiences of his family in the past: being beaten and scolded by the landlords; having nothing to eat, borrowing one dou, and returning three dou; his older brother being drafted by the Kuomintang... Today, he has turned over, but the Huai River still dominates the people along the river. When he returned to the construction site, he told the whole class his thoughts. After that, the laborers worked even harder, loaded more soil, pushed the carts faster, and helped other classes when they had time. Xiaoqun received Shunying's letter, needless to say how happy he was, and he worked even harder. That night, Xiaoqun wrote a reply, telling her about his situation and encouraging Shunying.
    After Shunying got married and sent Xiaoqun away, she took on the main labor at home. Field work, housework, she could do everything. The whole family was harmonious. The women of the mutual aid group also had a good leader. Shunying's family had few people, and when production was busy, Shunying would go back to take care of them. The villagers saw that the new daughter-in-law was so capable and worked so hard, and everyone praised her. There is a saying in Henan:
    "Locusts come out in a drought, fish come out in a flood." This year, after the wheat harvest, it was a bit dry. A township in this district discovered locusts, and more than half of three and a half mu of millet had been eaten. The district people's government issued a notice to let each township pay attention. Shunying was a member of the township women's federation, and when she heard about this, she went back with the mutual aid group leader to check the fields. They found many locusts on the hillside north of the village. In places with many nymphs, they could step on and kill several of them with one foot. Li Defu, the party branch secretary of the township, and Shunying were in the same production mutual aid group, and Shunying told him about it when she returned. After research, the branch made arrangements for the party members. That night, Shengou Village held a village meeting, mobilizing everyone to kill locusts. In the middle of the meeting, someone raised an objection. The reason was: the land on the north hillside belonged to other villages; the villagers were busy, so let the other villages kill them themselves. As soon as Shunying heard that the words were not right, she stood up and said: "Folks, we all still remember what happened more than ten years ago: in the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, there was a drought, and there was no harvest in the fields; in the thirty-second year, the crops grew well, but as soon as the locusts passed, everything was gone; in the thirty-third year, there were locusts again. During the three years of natural disasters, our Lushan people fled in teams. At that time, who cared about the life and death of our people? Now the people's government is leading us to kill locusts. The land on the north hillside belongs to other villages, but the locusts don't distinguish between villages. If we don't kill them today, they will come down the mountain tomorrow. Besides, don't we feel sorry for the locusts eating the crops of other villages?" As soon as the words fell, everyone in the audience said yes. The meeting passed a resolution: to kill locusts early tomorrow morning. When Shunying returned, she found several broken shoe soles and made paddles; she went out and helped several women with children make several more. The next day, people got up earlier than each other. Before dawn, they flocked to the hillside. They fought continuously for three days, killing a total of more than 2,800 mu, killing more than 280 jin of locusts. Later, Shunying led the people to help fight for a few days in other villages.
    After killing the locusts, it didn't rain, and the drought became more and more serious, and no wet soil could be plowed out of the ground. Many farmers were anxious: if they couldn't plant corn, there would be no harvest this year. Just then, the local people's government issued a call for drought resistance. Shunying's mutual aid group discussed how to resist drought. Her idea was to let women participate as well. But the women raised difficulties: of the ten women in the group, five had children. The children became a burden and could not be left at home unattended. Shunying thought of the method of the nursery during the busy farming season, and everyone agreed when she talked about it. The women specifically divided the work: the elderly and those with inconvenient legs and feet stayed at home to take care of the children; those who could walk delivered tea and water to the fields; everyone else dug wells. The women of other mutual aid groups in the village also learned this method. Digging wells was a heavy job, especially after the water came out, people felt stuffy at the bottom of the well. Shunying was strong, rolled up her trouser legs, and took turns with the men to dig in the well for two days. After the well was dug, Shunying led the women to plant corn. She also challenged a strong male group member to see who could carry more water, and no one failed. There was not much well water due to the drought, and the planted land was limited, so Shunying came up with another method: the mutual aid group had a well near the small river by the village, the riverbed was shallow, and there was water not far from digging. Shunying transferred nearly half of the people in the mutual aid group to dig the river here, and dug a sloping hole on one side of the river body to connect to the well body, allowing the river water to flow into the well. People kept digging the river, and large amounts of river water kept flowing into the well. The new water pump that Shunying's mutual aid group bought last winter by earning money from sideline production was brought to this well, and sixteen mu were irrigated in one go. The group planted a total of forty mu of corn during the drought resistance, which was the most in the village. After the drought resistance, the township evaluated models, and Shunying was the first among the women.
    As the weather got hot, the people in the township were concerned about the laborers harnessing the Huai River, and each household donated eggs and sent them to the Huai River construction site. Shunying thought about her drought resistance at home, wondering how Xiaoqun was harnessing the Huai River, so she sent a letter to Xiaoqun. The letter put forward a request: strive to return as a model! Xiaoqun did not disappoint her. On the first day of the sixth lunar month, he returned with a model class. After the two met, they were naturally affectionate and respectful. That night, Xiaoqun joked to Shunying, "Isn't the one who came back a loafer!"
    "Young people have great ideals" [Note], Xiaoqun and Shunying also have their own hopes.
    Xiaoqun and Shunying are both very active in learning, but Xiaoqun has the upper hand in terms of literacy. Before Xiaoqun left to harness the Huai River, he bought two copies of the "Farmers' Cultural Textbook" Volume 3, one for himself and one for Shunying. During this period, Shunying had a few pages of this book left unfinished, and Xiaoqun had read it several times. At the Huai River harnessing, Xiaoqun was often praised on the blackboard newspaper and at meetings; before returning, he was also rated as a learning model of the entire middle team. Xiaoqun studied particularly hard during the Huai River harnessing, and there was an important factor: on the construction site, he saw the role of bulldozers with his own eyes; the driver sat on it, looking ahead with both eyes, and one person could do the work of many people. Xiaoqun was very envious. He knew that in the future, the countryside would implement collectivization and mechanization, and farming would be done with tractors. One day, he took the time to find a cadre and wanted to sign up to learn how to drive a tractor. The cadre told him that it would be better to have a higher level of education to learn how to drive a machine, and encouraged him. Xiaoqun kept the words in his heart, and got up every day before dawn to read and write. After returning from the Huai River harnessing, he passed by Lushan County and bought a rapid literacy reader and asked the teacher in the village to teach him, and then taught Shunying the national phonetic alphabet spelling method. Being a tractor driver is Xiaoqun's wish; Shunying and Xiaoqun have similar ideas, but whether to be a tractor driver or go to a factory, she is still considering. But the common goal of the two at present is the same: to do a good job in work, production, and learning, so that they can go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao in the future. One more thing that Shunying has than Xiaoqun is to strive to join the party as soon as possible. The motherland has paved the way for her young generation, and young people are also paying their strength for the prosperity and strength of the motherland.

    一对青年夫妇——任小群和王顺英
    王青
    夫妻有互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女，为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务。
    ——摘录中华人民共和国婚姻法第三章第八条
    河南省鲁山县大沙河迤北，有个沈沟庄，庄里有
    一对非常要好的青年夫妇。男的叫任小群，今年二十二岁，女的叫王顺英，今年十八岁。这一对年青人全村、全乡的群众、干部都夸奖，今年十月底鲁山县贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会上，代表、模范们又评他俩为一等模范夫妇。
    王顺英、任小群的恋爱过程并不复杂。顺英娘家在十区八里乡。一九五一年旧历正月十六，娘叫顺英去接姐姐来住娘家。顺英姐姐叫淑范，嫁给沈沟庄的沈石头。顺英一进姐家大门，正好碰见小群。本来，顺英和小群从小就认识，只是没说过话。后来慢慢长大了，顺英看中小群老实能干，手巧心细；小群也觉得近村的年青妇女没一个赶得上她。但在旧社会，未婚男女说句话，就要受到责备。两人只好把心事藏在心里。婚姻法颁布以后，两人都有个打算。这次见了面，两个人虽说都心跳脸红，可一气谈了大半天。从谈话中，顺英知道小群是青年团员，村民兵队长，学习模范；小群也知道了顺英是青年团员，学习也好，担任着村妇联主席。双方又都是土地改革运动中的积极分子。有过去的基础，又有解放后的进步，两人在谈话中就彼此透露了互愿嫁娶的意思。
    顺英回到家里，娘看出闺女脸上喜气洋洋。一问，顺英说了实话。娘活了一辈子，没听说过自由恋爱，觉得闺女眼中太无爹娘了，便生着气说：
    “你自个找主？那可不行！”顺英想跟娘闹一场；又一想，爹死得早，姐姐早已出嫁，娘平日最疼的就是自己，还是先劝一下。顺英说：“娘，解放后，毛主席领导咱翻了身，分了地，如今又颁布了婚姻法，都是为咱好。你给姐姐包办了婚姻，两口子不和，姐姐成天挨打受气。她回来一趟哭一场，你也陪着淌泪，你不心烦？俺自己找好对象，准不让你挂心。”劝说了半天，娘居然回心转意了，答应顺英：“随你去吧，以后可别埋怨俺！”小群回到家里，把满肚子的高兴，一下子告诉了娘。娘是个受苦人。从小群的爹往上推三辈，都没有寸地片瓦，都是租种地主的地过日子，苦处说不完。那时，地主家的男人，不管眼瞎腿瘸，都可以讨三五个老婆。八区王庄乡就有个地主讨了六个老婆。可是穷家孩子，再是个人材，讨老婆也费难。小群在同年岁的青年中，啥都拔尖，可是长到五尺多高，还没人给提过媒。娘早就盼着抱孙子了，一听小群说，非常高兴。小群家当时只有三口人，爹六十多了，常犯心痛病，不大管闲事。两个哥哥在前几年就分出去过日子。娘一同意，就算全家通过。
    过了半个月，顺英又来姐姐家。那次谈过话以后，小群天天都来这里，希望碰见顺英，深谈一次。这次两人见了面，彼此谈了些分手后的情形和今后的计划，便算订了婚。以后两人又见过几次面，还在董村庙会上一起看过戏，吃过饭。
    小群和顺英恋爱，在沈沟庄的群众中有不同的反应。青年妇女觉得婚姻法真好，自己能掌握命运，再不会任别人摆弄着“嫁鸡”“嫁狗”了。她们说话声音更高了些；路上碰见小群就笑玩一阵。有几个未婚的青年找到小群，说要参加民兵，争取入团，工作一定积极起来，要像小群一样，以后自找对象。上年纪的老婆老汉，虽然看不惯，议论纷纷，说小群、顺英“不怕出丑”，可是因为干部支持他俩，也没敢出面阻拦。也有人想从中破坏。比如淑范的婆婆，原想当个媒人，把顺英说给她姐姐的儿子，如今一看风头不妙，就回到娘家（和顺英住同村），尖着嘴向顺英娘捏造小群工作如何不积极，人长得如何矮，等等，结果被顺英娘抢白了一顿，才打消了原来的念头。
    这时，毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的决心传到了这里。当地人民政府号召群众参加治淮。这件事使小群做了难。不报名吧，现在自己是个党员，义不容辞；报名吧，爹的心痛病又犯了，娘也正犯着病。虽说自己走后乡亲们能照顾一下，可是那能方便？他去找顺英商量。八里乡的民工也正报名。不知顺英从那里听说小群没报名，正满肚子气。两人一见面，几乎吵起来。小群耐着心把情况谈了一遍。顺英问：“那怎么办呢？”两人研究了半天，觉得只有结婚，由顺英照顾家庭这一个办法为好。可是那时顺英十七岁，不够结婚年龄。最后才决定，明年开春第二批民工治淮时，小群一定参加。
    第二年，也就是今年，旧历正月二十六日，顺英、小群用新的仪式举行了婚礼。旧历二月上旬，乡里举行治淮民工第二次报名大会。小群早就耐不住了，而且心里很懊悔——上次不该为了家庭把国家大事推在后头，况且爹娘的病不久也好了。他曾把自己的意思告诉给顺英，顺英同意他的看法。这次报名大会上，他第一个抢着报了名。临动身，顺英背着背包送了他一程，路上嘱咐他不要挂家；小群也嘱咐顺英在家好好工作和劳动。
    小群走后一个多月，一天晚上，顺英和同村的妇女去董村看了一出戏。戏名叫“雷老七雷老六治淮”。剧中演出了两人治淮同去同回，老六得了模范，老七被评为二流子的故事。看戏的时候，顺英就想到小群，回来的路上，满脑子也想的是“模范”、
    “二流子”。到家，天色已晚，顺英躺在床上，不久就睡着了。睡梦里，顺英看见小群一推门进来了，垂头丧脸，两眼无神。顺英问：“治淮完啦！”小群说：“没有。我想家，跑回来了。”一下顺英就火了：“你临走说的啥？不是保证治好淮河才回家？回去吧！要不我也不在你家了！”小群赖着不走，顺英气得大哭起来。婆婆住在隔壁，半夜听见顺英哭，不知媳妇受了什么委屈，披衣下床，过来推醒了顺英。顺英醒来知道是做梦，可是翻来覆去总也睡不着了。
    第二天，顺英匆匆吃完早饭，跑出去找到学校的袁教员，代给小群写了封信，勉励小群好好治淮，切勿想家。
    小群的工地在禹县白沙镇。小群这个班是运土班，全班十五个人，他是班长。九个班是一中队，中队里有二、三十个民兵，大家推选小群当队长，保护民工们的安全。临来，小群就蹩足了劲，工作走在人头里。他推的那车土，每次都装得满满的。休息日，他领着班里的人，到近村帮助军属挑粪、抬尿（做肥料用），收拾庄稼。当地群众告诉他，当年淮河的恶水怎样淹没了人口、田地和房屋。河南人民受水灾的苦处，小群是知道的。他更联想到过去全家悲痛的遭遇：被地主打来骂去；没吃的，借一斗，还三斗；大哥被国民党抓壮丁……。今天自己翻身了，淮河却还统治着沿河的人民。回到工地，他把自己的想法告诉了全班。以后，民工们干活更起劲了，土装得更多了，车推得更快了，抽空子还帮助其他班。小群接到顺英的信，不用说多么高兴了，工作更加努力了。当晚，小群写了回信，讲了下自己的情况，勉励了顺英。
    顺英过了门，送走了小群，在家里担任了主要劳动。地里活，家里活，样样都行。全家一团和气。互助组的妇女也有了个好领导人。顺英娘家人少，生产忙时，顺英回去照看一下。村里人看新媳妇这样能干，工作又强，个个称赞。河南有句俗话：
    “旱出蚂蚱涝出鱼”。今年麦收后，天有点旱。本区有一个乡发现了蚂蚱，三亩半谷子，被吃了一多半。区人民政府发下通知，让各乡注意。顺英是乡妇联委员，听说这件事，回去和互助组组长一块下地察看。她们在村北山坡上发现不少蚂蚱，蝻子多的地方，一脚下去能踩死几个。乡的党支部书记李德富和顺英在一个生产互助组，顺英回来告诉了他。支部研究后，向党员做了布置。当晚，沈沟庄开了村民大会，动员大家打蚂蚱。开会中间，有人提出了反对意见。理由是：北山坡的地是外村的；本村人忙，还是让外村的自己来打。顺英一听话不对头，站起来说：“老乡们，咱们还都记得十多年前的事吧：民国三十一年天旱，地里没收成；三十二年，庄稼长得倒不坏，蚂蚱一过，什么都完啦；三十三年，又是闹蚂蚱。三年天灾，咱鲁山逃荒的成了队。那时谁管咱老百姓的死活？如今人民政府领导咱们打蚂蚱。北山坡的地是外村的，可是蚂蚱不分村，今天不打，明天就会下山。再说，蚂蚱吃了外村的庄稼，咱们不心疼？”话刚一落地，满场的人都连声说对。大会通过决议：明天一早打蚂蚱。顺英回来，找了几个破鞋底，做成拍子；又出去帮助有小孩的妇女做了几个。第二天，人们一个比一个起得早，天还不大亮，就拥上山坡。连续打了三天，共打了二千八百多亩，打死蚂蚱二百八十多斤。以后顺英又领着人们去外乡帮助打了几天。
    打完蚂蚱，天还没下雨，旱象越来越严重，地里都犁不出湿土来。很多农民心里发了急：种不上玉米，今年可没着落。正在这时，当地人民政府发出了抗旱的号召。顺英的互助组讨论怎样抗旱，她的意思是想让妇女们也都能参加。可是妇女们提出了困难：全组十个妇女，五个有小孩。孩子变成了累赘，又不能丢在家里不管。顺英想起农忙托儿所的办法，一讲，大家都同意。妇女们具体分了工：年纪大、腿脚不便的在家看孩子；能走动的往地里送茶水；其他人都打井。本庄其他互助组的妇女，也都学了这个办法。打井是件重活，特别是打出水来以后，人在井底闷气。顺英人长得结实，卷起裤腿，和男子轮流下井打了两天。井打成后，顺英领着妇女点种玉米。她还和一个力气大的男组员挑战，看谁挑水挑得多，结果谁也没失败。天旱，井水不多，点种的地有限，顺英又想了办法：互助组有一口井，靠近村边小河，河底浅，挖不多深就有水。顺英把互助组近半数的人调来这里挖河，在河身的
    一边凿了个斜坡洞，通进井身，让河水流进井里。人们不断挖河，大股河水不断往井里流。顺英互助组去冬搞副业生产赚钱买的新式扬水机，抬到这个井上，一气浇了十六亩。全组在抗旱中共种玉米四十亩，是全村最多的一组。抗旱过去，全乡评选模范，顺英是妇女中的第一名。
    天一热，乡里的人们挂念着治淮的民工，各户都捐出鸡蛋，找人送到淮河工地上。顺英想着自己在家抗旱，不知小群治淮如何了，又捎了封信给小群。信上提出要求：争取模范回来！小群没辜负她的期望，在旧历六月初一，带着模范班回来了。两人见面后，自然是又亲热，又尊敬。当天晚上，小群打趣顺英说：“回来的不是个二流子吧！”
    “青年人怀着远大的理想”〔注〕，小群、顺英也有着自己的希望。
    小群、顺英两人学习都很积极，可是论识字，小群要占上风。小群在治淮临走前，买了两本“农民文化课本”第三册，一本自己带着，一本留给顺英。这期间，顺英这本还有几页没读完，小群读过了几遍。在治淮时，黑板报上、会上，小群常受到表扬；临回来，他又被评为全中队的学习模范。小群在治淮期间学习特别努力，有一个重要的因素：在工地上，他亲眼看到推土机的作用；司机坐在上面，两眼望着前方，一个人顶多少人干活。小群看得很眼馋。他知道将来农村要实行集体化机械化，种地用拖拉机。一天，他抽空找了个干部，要报名学开拖拉机。干部告诉他，学开机器，文化程度高一点好，勉励了他一番。小群把话记在心里，每天天朦朦亮就起床，看书，写字。治淮回来，路过鲁山县城，他买了本速成识字法读本，让村里的教员教会了他，然后又把国音字母拼法教会顺英。当拖拉机手，是小群的愿望；顺英和小群的想法差不多，不过是当拖拉机手呢，还是进工厂，她自己还在考虑。但两人当前共同的目的都是一样：工作、生产、学习，样样搞好，将来好去北京见毛主席。顺英比小群多的一条是争取早日入党。祖国为她底年青的一代铺好了前进的阶石，青年人也为祖国的繁荣富强支付着自己的力量。
