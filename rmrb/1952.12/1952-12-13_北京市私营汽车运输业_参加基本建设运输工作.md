The trucks, fully loaded with bricks, tiles, timber, steel, and cement, speed around the various construction sites in Beijing. Among them, three hundred and sixty-six large trucks marked with red flags are the contingent of Beijing's private motor vehicles participating in basic construction transportation work under the leadership of the state-owned transportation company.

The private motor vehicle industry in Beijing has been participating in basic construction transportation work for over three months. In order to cooperate with the winter basic construction rush work campaign, they have fully utilized all their vehicles and, together with state-owned transport vehicles, completed transportation tasks at over fifty construction sites. As the rush work campaign entered a tense stage, they adopted the method of "vehicles working around the clock" dividing the vehicles into day and night shifts for rush transport. Because the supply of building materials was timely, the construction sites rarely experienced shutdowns due to waiting for materials. The Chen Zifang transportation team in Dongdan District was awarded a banner by the Beijing Transportation Company for overcoming difficulties and completing tasks on schedule.

    北京市私营汽车运输业
    参加基本建设运输工作
    满载着砖瓦、木料、钢筋、水泥的卡车，飞也似的在北京各个工地上奔驰着，其中插着红旗标记的三百六十六辆大卡车，便是北京市私营汽车在国营运输公司领导下参加基本建设运输工作的队伍。
    北京市私营汽车参加基本建设运输工作已有三个多月了，为了配合冬季基本建设工程的抢工运动，他们开足了全部车辆与国营运输汽车一道完成了五十余处工地的运输任务。在抢工运动进入紧张阶段，他们曾采取歇人不歇车的办法把车辆分为日夜两班进行抢运。因为建筑器材供应及时，使工地很少发生停工待料的现象。东单区陈子芳运输小组因为能克服困难按期完成任务，获得了北京市运输公司奖旗一面。
