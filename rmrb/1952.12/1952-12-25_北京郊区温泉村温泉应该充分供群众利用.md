Editor's note: In late November, the residents of Hot Spring Village in the suburbs of Beijing wrote to reflect that the hot springs there were occupied by the Hot Spring Children's Primary School of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, and could not be fully utilized by the people. We immediately sent a letter to the Haidian District People's Government of Beijing Municipality to further understand this issue, and also sent a letter to the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission to solicit opinions on the utilization of hot springs. The replies from the above two agencies unanimously agreed that the opinions put forward by the masses were correct; the local hot springs should be fully utilized by the masses, and should not be occupied by one school, allowing the spring water to be wasted. We suggest that the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government attach importance to the opinions of the masses and consider relocating the Hot Spring Children's Primary School, so that this natural welfare can better serve the health of the people, and make the hot spring area more beautiful and become a beautiful scenic spot in the great capital of the motherland.

To the Editor: The hot springs in the suburbs of Beijing are a nationally renowned scenic spot. These hot springs are not only loved by our 300-odd households in Hot Spring Village, but also by the surrounding villages and the vast number of people in Beijing. In the past, every spring, summer, and autumn, men, women, old, and young from nearby areas, some for hygiene and some for recuperation, came in groups to the hot springs to bathe and wash clothes.

However, since the Hot Spring Children's Primary School of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry took over this place and repaired the hot springs, most of the bathhouses have been enclosed within the walls, and the people's bathing has been greatly restricted. After the masses reflected, the school finally separated two small pools outside the courtyard and slightly repaired the houses that had been bombed. However, now that the weather is cold, the doors outside these two small pools have been removed by the school again, and it is difficult for the masses to bathe. Everyone has repeatedly expressed their opinions on this matter, but to no avail. The masses are very dissatisfied and say: The hot springs are exclusively occupied by the school. Not only can our people not bathe casually, but even the cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanatorium and the North China Bureau Sanatorium of the CPC Central Committee cannot go to bathe casually.

To the Editor: Don't you think it is a pity that such good natural welfare for the people cannot be fully used to enhance the health of the people, but is occupied by a school, allowing the hot spring water to flow away in large quantities? Although this is a small problem, it is related to the health and well-being of many people. We believe it is necessary to report it to you and hope you will assist us in solving it.

Reply from the Haidian District People's Government

To the Editor: You asked us to understand the opinions of the local people on the use of hot springs. After investigation, the reply is as follows:

The address occupied by the Hot Spring Children's Primary School of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry was originally the affiliated girls' middle school of the former Sino-French University. After the "September 18th" Incident, the girls' middle school moved away, and Li Shizeng ran a primary school there; later, after the war, the houses were destroyed. After liberation, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government took over this place and built the Hot Spring Children's Primary School on the ruins. In addition to the main spring, which is a square large pool, there are four bathhouses in the west of the spring and three bathhouses in the east of the spring. The above main spring and bathhouses are all enclosed in the wall by the primary school; only two pools are left outside the wall for the masses to bathe; but there are no facilities, only two earthen houses. According to the masses, the school removed the doors last winter, making it impossible for the general public to bathe, and even more inconvenient for women to bathe. In July 1951, the local North China Bureau Sanatorium of the CPC Central Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanatorium, and the local village people's government, police station and other units held a meeting and decided that one of the pools in the courtyard could be used for senior cadres to bathe. In November, the school installed the doors outside the pools for the masses to bathe, and the public's opinion was slightly calmed.

We solicited the opinions of the village cadres and the masses in the village, and everyone unanimously agreed that hot springs are a natural wealth of the people and should be shared by the broad masses of the people; and should not be exclusively occupied by a primary school. Moreover, there are already sanatoriums such as the North China Bureau Sanatorium, the Ministry of Fuel Industry Sanatorium (under construction), and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanatorium around the hot springs, and many patients also need to take hot spring baths. Therefore, it is best for the People's Government to repair this hot spring, managed by a certain agency, and let the masses share it.

Reply from the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission

People's Daily Reader's Letters Group: The letter has been received. Now I will tell you our preliminary opinions on the planned use of hot springs in Hot Spring Village.

There are only two hot springs near Beijing: one is in Xiaotangshan, which is far from the city and has a good construction foundation, which is suitable as a long-term recuperation site; the other is in Hot Spring Village, which is closer to the city, although the construction foundation is poor, it is very valuable for development and is suitable for sightseeing and short-term recuperation.

Although the scenic conditions in Hot Spring Village are slightly poor at present, they can be cultivated by planning; surrounded by mountains in the south, with lush forests, it is a secluded and tranquil realm. Our association has planned to make it one of the important recuperation areas in the suburbs of the capital (two units are already building there). As for the hot springs themselves, they are one of the main conditions for developing a recuperation area, and future development plans will be coordinated with the hot springs. According to the local people, the spring water has a certain therapeutic effect (has not yet been tested); this is an ideal area for sightseeing and recuperation.

After liberation, the Ministry of Heavy Industry took over the hot spring bath and opened a primary school. In 1951, the primary school built 101 classrooms, offices, and dormitories without the approval of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. At the end of 1951, the school planned to expand on its current site, acquire farmland, and add houses; this was investigated and rejected by our association in conjunction with the Beijing Municipal Land Administration Bureau.

The opinions raised by the local people in their letter to you are correct. We plan to solve this problem with the following methods:

1.  The Beijing Municipal People's Government should jointly discuss the specific methods for recovering the current site of the Hot Spring Children's Primary School with the Ministry of Heavy Industry and other relevant units, and our association will formulate a hot spring development plan.
2.  Before the above methods are decided, the bathroom section should first be separated from the primary school, with separate doors for entry and exit (according to the existing buildings in the area, this can be done). At present, it is temporarily stipulated that the primary school uses the hot springs for a certain period of time; at other times, the public is allowed to use them, and the Haidian District People's Government is in charge of management.

### 北京郊区温泉村温泉应该充分供群众利用

专栏：

    北京郊区温泉村温泉应该充分供群众利用
    编者按：十一月下旬，北京郊区温泉村群众来信反映：该处温泉被中央人民政府重工业部温泉子弟小学所占，不能充分供群众利用。我们当即函请北京市海淀区人民政府对这个问题作进一步了解，并函请北京市都市计划委员会对温泉利用问题提出意见。上述两机关答复中一致认为：群众提出的意见是正确的；当地温泉应该充分让群众利用，不应由一个学校占着而任凭泉水浪费。我们建议中央人民政府重工业部重视群众的意见，考虑迁移温泉子弟小学，以便使这个天然的福利能更好地为人民健康服务，并使温泉区建设得更美丽，成为祖国伟大首都的一个优美的风景区。
    编辑同志：北京郊区的温泉是全国闻名的胜地。这个温泉不仅仅为我们温泉村三百余户老百姓所喜爱，而且为周围各村和北京市内的广大人民所喜爱。过去每年春、夏、秋三季，附近各地的男女老幼，有的为了讲卫生，有的为了疗养疾病，都成群结队到温泉洗澡、洗衣服。
    但是，自从中央人民政府重工业部温泉子弟小学接收了这块地方并修复温泉以后，大部浴池都被圈在院墙之内，老百姓洗澡受到许多限制。经过群众反映，该校总算把两个小池子隔到院外来，并把被炮火轰毁的房屋稍加修理了一下。但是，现在天冷了，这两个小池子外面的门子又都被学校摘去，群众就不好洗澡了。大家对此事多次提出意见，结果无效。群众很不满意地说：温泉被学校独占了。不但咱老百姓不能随便洗澡，就连北京市人民政府疗养院、中共中央华北局疗养院的干部们都不能随便去洗。
    编辑同志：您想这样良好的人民自然福利，不能被充分地用来增强人民的健康，而被一个学校占着，任凭温泉水大量地白白流跑，这不是很可惜的吗？这虽然是一个小问题，但却关系着很多群众的健康和福利，我们认为有必要向您反映，希望你们协助我们解决。温泉村群众
    海淀区人民政府的答复
    编辑同志：你们要我们了解当地群众对温泉使用问题的意见。经调查，现答复如下：
    中央人民政府重工业部温泉子弟小学所占地址原为前中法大学的附属女子中学。“九一八”事变后，女子中学迁走，李石曾又在该地办小学；后经战乱，房屋都被毁坏。解放后，中央人民政府重工业部接收了这个地方，即在废址修建，设立温泉子弟小学。当地温泉，除水源为一方形大池之外，在泉西有浴池四个，泉东有浴池三个。以上主泉及浴池皆由该小学圈进墙内；墙外只留两个池供群众洗澡；但毫无设备，只有两间土房。据群众反映：去年冬天该校把门摘走，致使一般群众无法洗澡，妇女更不便洗澡。一九五一年七月间，在当地的中共中央华北局疗养院、北京市人民政府疗养院和当地村人民政府、派出所等单位与该校开会议决，在院内的池子可以抽出一间由高级干部洗澡。十一月，该校方将院外让群众洗澡的池子外的门安上，群众意见才稍稍平息。
    我们征求了该村村干部和群众意见，大家一致认为：温泉为群众的天然财富，应为广大的人民共同享用；而不应由一个小学独占。且温泉周围已有华北局疗养院、燃料工业部疗养院（正在修建中）及北京市人民政府疗养院等疗养机关，不少病人也需要洗温泉浴。因此，这个温泉最好由人民政府加以修缮，由一定机关管理，让群众共同享用。
    北京市海淀区人民政府
    北京市都市计划委员会的答复
    人民日报读者来信组：来信收到。现将我会对温泉村温泉计划使用的初步意见告诉你们。
    北京近郊只有两个温泉：一个在小汤山，离城很远，建筑基础较好，适宜作长期休养地址；一处即在温泉村，离城较近，建筑基础虽差，但很有开发的价值，适宜作游览及短期休养地址。
    温泉村目前风景条件虽稍差，但可计划培植；南面群山环抱，林木苍森，系一幽邃恬静境界。我会已计划作为首都近郊重要休养区之一（已有两个单位在那里建设）。至于温泉本身则为开辟休养区的主要条件之一，将来的发展计划均与温泉相配合。据当地群众反映，泉水颇有医疗作用（尚未作化验研究）；这是一个理想的游览及休养的地区。
    解放后，重工业部接管温泉浴池开办小学。一九五一年该小学未经北京市人民政府批准，擅自兴建教室、办公室和宿舍等一百零一间。一九五一年底，该校拟就现址扩充，收用耕地，添建房屋；经我会会同北京市地政局勘查批驳。
    当地群众给你们来信所提意见是正确的。我们计划用以下办法解决这一问题：
    一，由北京市人民政府与重工业部及其他有关单位共同商讨收回温泉子弟小学现址的具体办法，并由我会拟订温泉发展计划。
    二，在上述办法未决定前，先将浴室部分从该小学划出，另开门进出（根据该地建筑现状，是可以这样做的）。目前暂规定一定的时间由小学使用温泉；其他时间则公开让群众使用，由海淀区人民政府掌握管理。
