    Britain—America—Canada
    ——Toronto Travelogue, Part 3
    Wu Wentao
    The Crown of Great Britain
    Today, many Canadian institutions or companies still carry the words "Royal" or "Imperial" in their names; the image of the crown is still printed on government documents; and Queen Elizabeth II of England, like her great-grandmother Queen Victoria, still maintains the status of "Her Majesty" of Canada.
    History records that the entry of British colonists into Canada centuries ago was first built on the basis of killing and exploiting the Indians. Indian names such as "Toronto," "Ottawa," and "Canada," like many place names in the United States, remind us of the Indian nation that is about to be eliminated. Of the more than 13 million people in Canada today, more than 45 percent originate from the island of Great Britain (including the island of Ireland), more than 30 percent are from France, and the original masters of the land—the Indians and Eskimos—number only a little over 100,000.
    In the period of defeating rivals from France and repelling the armed invasion of Toronto by the United States in 1812, the British bourgeoisie’s branch in Canada gradually embarked on the road of developing its own bourgeois economy by supplying British manufacturing with raw materials while accepting British manufactured goods and investment. In 1867, Canada became a federation from scattered colonies, which greatly facilitated this development; World War I further accelerated this development. In order to pay for the large amount of war materials from Canada, Britain had to sell a large amount of its property and stocks in Canada.
    However, with the weakening of the British bourgeoisie's power and the reduction of investment, a large amount of American capital poured into Canada. Summarizing the characteristics of this process, Comrade Buck, General Secretary of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, wrote: "With increasing understanding of the intricate implications of Canada's relationship to Britain and the United States, and the intensification of the competition between British and American financial capital in Canada, social leaders are making greater efforts to determine Canada's autonomy, while retaining all the benefits of their special status within the British Empire." ("Canada - A Communist View," p. 58)
    The British Imperial Conference of 1926 formally announced the victory of the Canadian bourgeoisie's struggle to exercise sovereignty. By this time, of the total foreign investment of 7.6 billion US dollars in Canada, 4.6 billion were American and only 2.8 billion were British ("Foreign Investment in Canada," edited by Pierce et al., USA). The serious trauma of World War II again forced Britain to abandon a quarter of its total overseas investment. British investment in Canada today is only 1.7 billion US dollars ("National Affairs" May 1952 issue).
    The "Royal York Hotel," the 20-story building where we stayed in Toronto, looks very much like a British property from its name. It belongs to the Canadian Pacific Railway system. Originally, this railway, built in the 19th century to connect scattered colonial areas between the two oceans to prevent them from being annexed by the United States one by one, has also largely fallen into the hands of Americans.
    The position of the British bourgeoisie in Canada has thus been actually taken away by the American financial magnates, although the symbol of the crown is still retained.

    Canada's Role
    The leading part of the Canadian bourgeoisie—the bank capitalists—in the process of American financial capital overwhelming British financial capital, has changed from a small clerk of the London "City" to an agent auctioning Canada to Wall Street.
    The main reason why they and their political representatives in the federal and provincial governments bring in a large amount of American capital and auction off Canada to the United States is that they have lost confidence in the future in the face of the overall crisis of world capitalism, and they try to use every possible opportunity to interact with American capital in order to pursue some profits and maintain their rule over the people. Their problem is how to get more benefits from the big bosses. As the American magazine "Collier's" said in August this year: "A recent report to the Investment Bankers Association of America suggested a way to encourage Canada to have more confidence in its own destiny: ‘American companies participating in direct investment in Canada should take steps to allow Canadian investors to purchase shares of purely American-run companies or Canadian-managed (American) subsidiaries at the same price.’ If this is done, those Canadians who still regard us (referring to American financial magnates) as demons may forget how much bigger we are than them."
    Unlike the United States more than a hundred years ago, Canada, although it has actually separated from Britain, has not declared anything like a "Declaration of Independence." On the contrary, it still maintains the status of a dominion member. This status is very beneficial to Canada, especially to American bank capital. Through the status of "dominion," thousands of American companies' branch plants or subsidiaries in Canada can enjoy the "preferential" rights of the British Empire's market and attack British manufacturing. Britain, which used to export industrial products to Canada, is increasingly unable to compete with American manufacturing that has set up factories locally, and of course, it is increasingly unable to import raw materials from Canada. In this way, the so-called "North Atlantic Triangle" in the past (that is, Canada used the surplus of its exports to Britain and its dependencies to pay for the excess of American imports to Canada) relationship has been broken. Two-thirds of Canada's import and export trade has turned to the United States ("Collier's" magazine, August issue)—American manufactured goods, Canadian raw materials.
    Faced with the shrinking capitalist market and the pressure of the dollar bloc (including Canada) on the pound sterling area (Britain and its dominions and colonies, as well as some countries in the Near East), the British bourgeoisie will naturally try its best to resist and will not give up. The royal visits, the convening of federal prime ministers' conferences..., are the British bourgeoisie's attempt to maintain its fragmented "empire."
    What about Canada? It is "increasingly becoming the spokesman for North American imperialism within the British Empire, rather than, as before, acting as the representative of the British Empire in North America." ("National Affairs" magazine, July 1952 issue)

    The Result of the Auction
    Along with the auction of Canada, opposing forces have also emerged within the Canadian bourgeoisie.
    First of all, because the production of important raw materials is controlled by American capitalists, the supply of raw materials for manufacturing industries operated by Canadian capital depends on others. Tens of millions of tons of Canadian iron sand are transported to the United States, while "Mr. Hilton, the manager of 'Canadian Steel Corporation,' said on August 1 that whether 'Canadian Steel Corporation' can get enough iron this winter is still doubtful. He admitted that 'Canadian Steel Corporation' relies on American companies to supply iron. He cannot be sure whether these companies will allow 'Canadian Steel Corporation' to get enough iron." ("Canadian Forum" August 11)
    Some Canadian bourgeois newspapers have long expressed dissatisfaction with this situation. The Hamilton (Canada's steel manufacturing center) "News" said on March 12: "The great and urgent danger facing Canada arises from the astonishing inflow of American capital and the increasing outflow of raw materials." "Canada has become an economic colony of the United States... a logger and water-drawer for the American industrial machine. The time has come when we need to embargo the export of raw materials so that our workers can be employed."
    Equally serious is the massive dumping of American daily industrial products. It was precisely when we were in Toronto that American clothing, which was cheaper than what was sold in the United States, flooded the market, forcing the clothing industries in Toronto and Quebec to close down one after another. Other manufacturing industries of household electrical appliances and agricultural machinery operated by Canadian capital have also reduced production and laid off employees due to the dumping of American goods. Hugh Crombie, chairman of the Canadian Manufacturers Association, publicly stated in a speech that the government should give Canadian manufacturing "a fair chance in the Canadian market to deal with the alarming increase in imported goods—especially daily necessities, and mainly from the United States." "The attitude of the United States has created a disappointing and indignant situation." ("Canadian Forum" April 7)
    In addition, when entrusting the fate of export trade to the United States, Canada must be at the mercy of the American economic situation and customs. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives suddenly announced a ban on imports of Canadian cheese and boycotted Canadian meat on the pretext of livestock foot-and-mouth disease, especially the U.S. policy of restricting trade between the East and the West, which made countless Canadian manufacturing bosses and exporters complain. The Progressive Conservative newspaper "Spectator" of Hamilton City said on April 16: "Many Canadians are wondering: Aren't we too closely tied to the American economy, and in the process, have we lost our traditional overseas outlet, which is the only way to prosperity that we know?"
    The American eagle has seized Canada tightly. The Canadian people are, of course, the deepest sufferers.

    英国—美国—加拿大
    ——多伦多纪行之三
    吴文焘
    大不列颠的王冠
    今天，加拿大的很多机关或公司的名称，还带着“皇家”或“帝国”的字样；王冠的形象，还被刊在政府的文件上；英国女王伊丽莎白二世，也还像她曾祖母维多利亚女王那样，保持着加拿大的“陛下”的身份。
    历史记载着：几百年前英国殖民者的入主加拿大，首先是建筑在残杀和剥削印第安人的基础上。“多伦多”、“渥太华”以及“加拿大”等这些印第安名称，和美国很多地名一样，都提醒着行将被消灭的印第安民族。在今天全加拿大一千三百余万人口中，源于不列颠岛（包括爱尔兰岛）的有百分之四十五强，来自法国的占百分之三十强，而当地本来的主人——印第安人和爱斯基摩人，一共不过剩下十万多人了。
    在战胜来自法国的对头、并在一八一二年打退美国武装侵略多伦多一带的时期里，加拿大的英国资产阶级的支脉，就从供给英国制造业以原料同时接受英国的制成品和投资而逐渐走上发展自己资产阶级经济的道路，一八六七年加拿大从分散的殖民地成为联邦，大大便利了这个发展；第一次世界大战更加速了这个发展。为了偿付从加拿大来的大量作战物资，英国不得不出卖其大量的在加拿大的财产和股票。
    但在英国资产阶级的势力削弱和投资减低的情况下，大量美国资本又打进了加拿大。概括这一过程的特点时，加拿大劳工进步党总书记布克同志写道：“日益深刻了解到加拿大对于英国和美国关系的错综含意，以及英、美财政资本在加拿大竞争的激烈化，社会领导人物们便以更大的努力来确定加拿大的自主权，同时保留着他们在不列颠帝国内特殊地位的一切便利。”（“加拿大——共产党人的看法”第五八页）
    一九二六年的不列颠帝国会议，正式宣告了加拿大资产阶级争取行使主权的斗争的胜利。到这个时候，在加拿大全部外国投资的七十六亿美元中，已有四十六亿是美国的，英国的只有二十八亿（“在加拿大的外国投资”，美国彼尔斯等编）。第二次世界大战的严重创伤，又迫使英国放弃了四分之一的全部海外投资。英国在加拿大的投资，到今天只剩下了十七亿美元（“民族事务”一九五二年五月号）。
    我们在多伦多住的二十层大楼“皇家约克饭店”，从名称上看，是十分像个英国财产的。它属于加拿大的太平洋铁路系统。原来这条在十九世纪为了连结两洋之间分散的殖民区以防为美国一一并吞而修筑的铁路，也已在很大程度上落入美国人手中了。
    英国资产阶级在加拿大的地位，就这样实际被美国大财阀们夺了去，虽然王冠这个象征还被保留着。
    加拿大的角色
    加拿大资产阶级的主导部分——银行资本家们，在美国财政资本压倒英国财政资本的过程里，已由伦敦“城”的小伙计，变成了向华尔街拍卖加拿大的经纪人了。
    他们和他们在联邦与省的政治代表们所以把大量美国资本引进来，把加拿大拍卖给美国，主要是由于在世界资本主义总危机的面前对未来失去了信心，企图利用一切可能的机会与美国资本交互结合起来，以便追求一些利润，并维持他们对人民的统治。他们的问题，就是怎样向大老板们多讨一些油水。今年八月份的美国“柯里尔”杂志就这样说：“最近一个向美国投资银行家协会的报告，提出了一个鼓励加拿大对自己命运多具些信心的途径：‘在加拿大参加直接投资的美国公司，应当采取步骤，使加拿大的投资者有机会能用同一价钱购买纯由美国人经营的公司或由加拿大人经管的（美国）支公司的股票。’如果这样作了，那些仍把我们（指美国财阀们）当作恶魔看的加拿大人，就可能会忘记我们是比他们大到怎样的程度了。”
    和百余年前的美国不同，加拿大实际上虽已脱离了英国，但并没有宣布过像“独立宣言”之类的东西。相反的，它还保持着一个自治领成员的身份。这种身份对于加拿大、特别是对于美国的银行资本是十分有利的。通过“自治领”的身份，美国企业在加拿大的成千的分厂或支厂，就可以享受不列颠帝国领域内市场的“优惠”权，而向英国制造业进攻。过去向加拿大输出工业品的英国，日益敌不过在当地设厂的美国制造业，当然也就日益无力从加拿大输入原料。这样，过去的所谓“北大西洋三角”（即：加拿大以它对英国及其属地出口的盈余来支付美国向加拿大进口的超额）关系打破了。加拿大三分之二的进出口贸易，已转向了美国（“柯里尔”杂志八月号）——美国的制成品，加拿大的原料。
    面对着资本主义市场的日益缩小和美元集团（加拿大在内）向英镑范围（英国及其自治领和殖民地以及近东部分国家）的压力，英国资产阶级自然要尽力招架、不肯甘休的。皇室的游访，联邦总理会议的召开……，就是英国资产阶级企图维持其支离破碎的“帝国”的表示。
    加拿大呢？它“日益成为在不列颠帝国内部北美帝国主义的代言人，而不像以前那样，作为不列颠帝国在北美洲的代表了。”（“民族事务”杂志一九五二年七月号）
    拍卖的结果
    和加拿大被拍卖的同时，加拿大资产阶级内部也产生了对抗的势力。
    首先，由于重要原料的生产控制在美国资本家手里，加拿大资本所经营的制造业的原料供给，就要仰人鼻息。成千万吨的加拿大铁砂被运往美国去，而“‘加拿大钢铁公司’的经理希尔敦先生八月一日说，‘加拿大钢铁公司’今年冬季能否得到足够的铁还可怀疑。他承认‘加拿大钢铁公司’依靠美国公司供给铁。他不能肯定是否这些公司将允许‘加拿大钢铁公司’得到足够的铁。”（八月十一日“加拿大论坛报”）
    加拿大一部分资产阶级报纸对于这种情势早已表示不满了。哈密尔敦（加拿大钢铁制造业中心）“新闻”报三月十二日说：“加拿大所面对着的巨大而迫切的危险，是从美国资本的惊人流入和原料日益增加的流出而产生的。”“加拿大已经成了美国的经济殖民地……，成了美国工业机器的伐木者和吸水者。我们需要禁运原料出口以便使我国工人就业的时候该到了。”
    同样严重的，是美国日用工业品的大量倾销。正是我们在多伦多的时候，价格比在美国卖得还便宜的美国服装充斥市场，迫使多伦多和魁北克的制衣业纷纷倒闭。其他由加拿大资本经营的家庭电气用具和农业机器制造业等，也由于美货倾销而紧缩生产，裁减员工。加拿大制造业协会主席休·克罗比就在公开讲演中要求政府，使加拿大制造业“在加拿大市场上有一个公平的机会，来对付进口货——特别是日用品，而且主要是来自美国的日用品——的可惊的增加。”“美国的态度已经产生了使人失望和愤激的情况。”（四月七日“加拿大论坛报”）
    另外，在将出口贸易的命运交给美国时，加拿大就必须听凭美国经济情势和税关来摆布。最近美国众议院突然宣布禁止加拿大乳酪类进口，并藉口发生牲畜口蹄疫而抵制加拿大的肉类，特别是美国限制东西方间贸易的政策，使得无数加拿大制造业老板和出口商们怨声载道。哈密尔敦城的进步保守党报纸“旁观者”四月十六日这样说：“很多加拿大人在怀疑：难道我们不是过紧地和美国经济结在一起，并在这个过程中失去了我们传统的海外出路，而只有这是我们所知道的唯一的繁荣的出路？”
    美国的鹰死死地攫住了加拿大。受害最深的当然还是加拿大人民。
