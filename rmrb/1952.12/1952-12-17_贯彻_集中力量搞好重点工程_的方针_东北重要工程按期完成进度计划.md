    Implement the Policy of "Concentrating Efforts on Key Projects"
    Northeast Important Projects Complete Progress Plan on Schedule

    [By Our Newspaper] The Party and government leading organs in Northeast China, in the capital construction work of 1952, resolutely implemented the policy of "concentrating efforts on key projects," enabling many heavy industrial factories, mines, and power stations of decisive significance for the country's industrial development to complete their progress plans on schedule or ahead of schedule. In today's situation where economic construction is facing a shortage of both manpower and material resources, adopting such a leadership method to ensure the completion of important projects is a very important experience in the Northeast's capital construction work this year.

    The Northeast region's leadership method of "concentrating efforts on key projects" has permeated the entire capital construction process this year. When formulating the capital construction plan, the Party and government leading organs in the Northeast region determined that the focus should be on developing enterprises that produce means of production. In 1952, the majority of the Northeast region's capital construction investment was concentrated in the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government; within the Industrial Department, the focus was on the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the five bureaus of non-ferrous metals, electric power, coal mines, machinery, and electrical appliance industries. The workload of these six units accounted for 65.55 percent of the total workload of the Industrial Department. Among these key departments, the state's investment was heavily concentrated in dozens of new and reconstructed enterprises. These key projects included the construction of large-scale, technically complex iron and steel plants, thermal power plants, hydroelectric power plants, vertical shafts, open-pit mines, and heavy-duty machine tool and electrical machinery factories, with a total workload accounting for 43 percent of the Industrial Department's total workload.

    In terms of resource allocation, the Northeast Party and government leading organs paid special attention to strengthening the units responsible for important projects. The aforementioned six units, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, have transferred more than 20,000 cadres, technicians, and workers from their production departments to capital construction; Party and government leading organs at all levels in the Northeast have also transferred many cadres from other positions to these key units to undertake various tasks. The political department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's capital construction alone was equipped with hundreds of staff members. This summer, the central government allocated more than 7,000 university and junior college graduates to Northeast China from within the customs; more than 4,000 were assigned to the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department system, and the vast majority of them were assigned to the key departments of capital construction. Anshan Iron and Steel Company was allocated 1,000 people, of whom nearly 900 were put into capital construction.

    In the preparation work for capital construction in the Northeast region this year, difficulties such as insufficient design capacity and insufficient supply of certain building materials in the first quarter were encountered. In overcoming these difficulties, the leading organs at all levels in the Northeast also adopted the method of concentrating efforts on key projects first, conducting unified scheduling according to the importance of the projects and the priority of the construction period. As a result, not only were the key projects able to start construction early, but also the plan for completing the secondary projects within the year was not affected.

    During the construction process, the leading organs at all levels in the Northeast paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of key projects. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee sent working groups to the main construction sites of Anshan Iron and Steel Company for a long time to study the experience of conducting political work on the construction sites; working groups were sent to the Fuxin Power Plant, which was directly assisted by Soviet experts, to help summarize the experience of using advanced Soviet technology to install boilers and turbines and in construction site management. The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government and its subordinate key bureaus and key companies concentrated their main efforts to deeply grasp the specific situation of each key project, such as design, equipment, material supply, project progress, and quality, and promptly provided criticism, commendation, and practical assistance. For example, the Jilin substation project of the Electric Power Bureau was one of the main projects of the bureau this year, but the design office of the bureau did not grasp the spirit of ensuring that key projects were done well first, and transferred the main designers to build the bureau's office building first. After discovering this erroneous practice, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government promptly criticized it, corrected it, and circulated it to all subordinate units to educate all cadres to establish a strict overall perspective. In particular, the two major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, thanks to the strong support of the central government, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, concentrated a large amount of manpower and material resources, reversing the situation at the beginning when the plan could not be completed every month. Before August, only about 6 percent of the total project volume could be completed each month; in September, more than 19 percent of the total project volume was completed; and in October, the entire month's plan was completed in 20 days. In order to enable all units to concentrate more attention on key projects, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government stipulated completion deadlines for some important projects, and designated the construction units of these key projects to be responsible for formulating specific plans to ensure on-time completion, so that the leading departments could better conduct inspection and assistance based on these plans.

    As a result of taking the above-mentioned series of measures, units such as the Fuxin Power Plant and the Harbin Flax Factory in the Northeast have completed their construction tasks on schedule and started production. By the end of October, the average progress of dozens of key projects of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government had reached 69 percent of the total project, which was better than the completion of general projects. It is expected that by the end of this year, these key projects can complete the planned annual progress.

### 贯彻“集中力量搞好重点工程”的方针  东北重要工程按期完成进度计划

    贯彻“集中力量搞好重点工程”的方针
    东北重要工程按期完成进度计划
    【本报讯】东北地区的党政领导机关在一九五二年基本建设工作中，坚决贯彻了“集中力量搞好重点工程”的方针，使许多对国家工业发展有决定意义的重工业工厂、矿井和发电站都按期或提前完成了进度计划。在经济建设的人力物力都感不足的今天，采取这样的领导方法以保证重要工程的完成，是东北今年基本建设工作中的一个很重要的经验。
    东北地区“集中力量搞好重点工程”的领导方法，贯串在今年整个基本建设过程中。在制订基本建设计划时，东北地区党政领导机关就确定了以发展生产生产资料的企业为重点。一九五二年东北地区的基本建设投资，绝大部分集中在东北人民政府工业部；而在工业部中，又以鞍山钢铁公司及有色金属、电业、煤矿、机械、电器工业等五个管理局为重点。这六个单位的工作量占工业部总工作量的百分之六十五点五五。在这些重点部门中，国家的投资又大量集中在数十个新建与改建的企业上。这些重点工程包括修建规模巨大的、技术上非常复杂的钢铁厂、火力发电站、水力发电站、竖井、露天矿及重型工作母机和电气机械工厂，工作量合计占工业部全部工作量的百分之四十三。
    在力量的配备上，东北党政领导机关特别注意加强担负着重要工程项目的单位。上述鞍山钢铁公司等六个单位，已从本单位生产部门抽调了两万余名干部、技术人员和工人到基本建设方面；东北各级党政领导机关还从其他岗位上抽调了很多干部到这些重点单位来担任各项工作。仅鞍山钢铁公司基本建设政治部就配备了数百个工作人员。今年暑期，中央从关内分配给东北七千余名大学与专科学校毕业生，有四千余名分配给了东北人民政府工业部系统，其中绝大部分人又都分配到基本建设的重点部门。鞍山钢铁公司分配到一千名，其中将近九百人投入了基本建设。
    在东北区今年基本建设准备工作中，曾遇到设计力量不足和第一季度中某些建筑材料供应不够等困难。在克服这些困难时，东北各级领导机关也都采取了集中力量先搞重点工程的办法，按照工程的重要性和工期的先后，进行统一的调度，结果不但使重点工程得以先期开工，而且也没有影响次要工程在年内完工的计划。
    在施工过程中，东北各级领导机关特别注意加强对各重点工程的领导。中共中央东北局曾派遣工作组长期深入鞍山钢铁公司的主要工地，研究在工地进行政治工作的经验；派遣工作组到有苏联专家直接帮助的阜新发电厂，帮助总结运用苏联先进技术安装锅炉、透平与工地管理等经验。东北人民政府工业部与所属各重点局、重点公司，集中主要力量，深入地掌握每一个重点工程的设计、设备、材料供应、工程进度及质量等具体情况，并及时予以批评、表扬和实际帮助。例如电业局的吉林一项变电所工程，是本年度该局主要工程之一，但是该局设计处没有掌握必须先搞好重点工程的精神，而将主要设计人员调去先修建该局的办公大楼。东北人民政府工业部发现这种错误的做法之后，及时进行批评，加以纠正，并通报所属各单位，教育全部干部必须树立严格的全局观点。特别是鞍山钢铁公司的两大主要工程，由于中央及中共中央东北局、东北人民政府工业部的大力支持，集中了大批人力物力，扭转了开始时每月都不能完成计划的情况。八月份以前，每月只能完成工程总量百分之六左右，九月份便完成了工程总量百分之十九以上，十月份在二十天中便完成了全月计划。为了使各单位更集中注意力于重点工程，东北人民政府工业部对部分重要工程曾规定了竣工期限，并指定这些重点工程的建设单位负责拟定保证按时竣工的具体计划，以便领导部门根据这些计划更好地进行检查与帮助。
    由于采取了上述一系列的措施，目前东北区已有阜新发电厂、哈尔滨亚麻厂等单位按时完成了建设任务，开始生产。到十月末，东北人民政府工业部数十个重点工程的平均进度，已达到全部工程的百分之六十九，比一般工程完成情况要好。预计到今年年末，这些重点工程都可完成预定的全年进度计划。
