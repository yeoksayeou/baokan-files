    The CCP Yingshang County Committee Handles Yang Yubao's Oppression of the Masses

    Editor: We have dealt with the matter of Yang Yubao, the director of the Nangzhao Town Farmers' Association in Yingshang County, using his position to oppress the masses (published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on December 25). In addition to removing Yang Yubao from his post, he has also been expelled from the Party. The district party secretary, Fu Yuebo, has written a self-criticism about this matter, which has not yet been finalized. He has now been transferred to the Party school for study, and the final decision will be made in conjunction with other issues. Gao Shixun, the town mayor of Nangzhao Town, and Xu Shengran, the finance and grain cadre, who jointly oppressed the Chen family with Yang Yubao, have both been given the penalty of removal from their posts. The control over the Chen family has been publicly announced as cancelled, and the government has paid her 400,000 yuan in medical expenses. The government will also provide free treatment for her postpartum (the child died after birth) back pain. Chen has expressed her agreement with this handling. On December 13, a mass meeting of more than 5,000 people was held in the town to announce the handling of this incident. The masses responded very well, saying: The Communist Party and the People's Government truly support the people. Cadres who make mistakes are also punished.

    中共颍上县委会对杨玉保欺压群众事已作处理
    编辑同志：我们对颍上县南照镇农会主任杨玉保利用职权欺压群众的事（刊十二月二十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏），已经作了处理。除已将杨玉保撤职外，党内并开除他出党。区委书记傅月波对这件事已作了一个书面检讨，尚未最后处理。他现在已调往党校学习，最后将结合其他问题再一并处理。和杨玉保共同欺压陈氏的南照镇镇长高士勋、财粮干部徐盛然，均给以撤职处分。对陈氏的管制已当众宣布取消，并由政府发给医药费四十万元。她产后（孩子生下后死亡）的腰痛病，也由政府给以免费治疗。陈氏对这样处理表示同意。十二月十三日在该镇召开的五千余人的群众大会上，宣布了对这一事件的处理。群众反映很好，他们说：共产党和人民政府真给人民撑腰，干部犯了错误，也一样受处分。　中共颍上县委员会
