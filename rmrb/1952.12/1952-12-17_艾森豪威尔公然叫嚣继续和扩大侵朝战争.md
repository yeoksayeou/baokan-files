Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Eisenhower, who went to Korea to plan the continuation and expansion of the war of aggression, has returned to the United States on the 14th with his war plans after holding a series of military conferences in the Pacific.

In a statement issued after his return home, Eisenhower flatly denied the promises he made to American voters in Detroit and Pittsburgh to go to Korea to "end the Korean War" and called on the American people to prepare for continued war. He said, "As you know, the simple purpose of my trip to Korea was to see, listen, and understand, so that the experiences of the Allied soldiers there could become the criterion for my future handling of this problem." Eisenhower told the American people that "there is no easy way to quickly and victoriously end this war," and therefore, he wants the American people to "honestly face reality" and continue to be "prepared" for the "arduous task" ahead, which includes "spiritual preparation and tangible armament." Here, Eisenhower is hinting to the American people that the Korean War must continue, so the American people should be prepared to continue sending their sons and husbands to Korea to serve as cannon fodder.

Eisenhower then openly revealed his plan to continue and expand the war. He said that he returned from Korea this time "with a new belief that it is possible to expedite a satisfactory solution in Korea." Eisenhower stated that this "new belief" arose after he met with General Clark, commander of the U.S. forces invading Korea, puppet Syngman Rhee, Admiral Radford, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and General Chase, head of the U.S. military advisory group stationed with the Kuomintang bandit gang. To avoid prematurely exposing the sinister nature of these talks, Eisenhower refused to disclose the specific content of these talks to the American people, citing the fact that he had not yet taken office as president and military secrets. However, in his "observations" regarding "everything in the future," people can already see the steps that Eisenhower will take.

In these "observations," Eisenhower proposed his method of "expediting a satisfactory solution in Korea," which is: first, "the training of the Syngman Rhee puppet army can and must be expanded and accelerated." Second, "certain supply problems" should be "corrected as soon as possible." According to a United Press International dispatch from New York on the 14th, "well-informed sources" said that this means accelerating the supply of "certain types of artillery and more jet fighters." In addition, these people said that more helicopters are needed to "boost" the morale of American pilots, because pilots shot down by the Korean and Chinese sides need to be rescued by these aircraft. All of this is clearly in preparation for launching a large-scale offensive. Eisenhower's final "observation" is that "in consideration and planning, it should be recognized" that "the Korean War is the most intense and painful aspect for us." Here, he is hinting that he will投入even greater strength into this unwinnable war of aggression.

Eisenhower's so-called "new efforts to seek a glorious end to this aspect of the global struggle" is a vicious war plan. Eisenhower said that his trip to Korea was only the "beginning" of this "new effort." He bluntly stated that he is unwilling to resolve the Korean issue through negotiations, but wants to resort to force.

Thus, on his first day back in the United States, Eisenhower exposed himself to the American people as a complete liar. The outgoing Truman ridiculed Eisenhower's trip to Korea on the 11th as merely "a means of currying favor," saying that he had no "viable solution." But Eisenhower's deceptive tactics will never "curry favor," but will only arouse the anger of the American people and prompt them to strengthen the struggle to end the Korean War. Truman has already used his own personal experience to foreshadow the fate of this new lackey of Wall Street.

### 艾森豪威尔公然叫嚣继续和扩大侵朝战争

    艾森豪威尔公然叫嚣继续和扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社十六日讯】到朝鲜去策划继续和扩大侵略战争的艾森豪威尔，在太平洋上举行了一系列军事会议以后，已经带着他的战争计划于十四日回到美国。
    艾森豪威尔在他回国以后发表的声明中，劈头就把他在底特律和匹兹堡向美国选民说过的到朝鲜去“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言抵赖得一干二净，并且要美国人民准备继续战争。他说，“你们都知道我的朝鲜之行的简单目的是去看一看，听一听并且了解一下，以便使那里的联军士兵的经验和体会能成为我将来处理这个问题时的准则。”艾森豪威尔告诉美国人民说，“没有什么简易办法迅速而胜利地结束这场战争”，因此，他要美国人民“诚实地面对现实”，继续对面前的“艰巨任务”“有所准备”，这种“准备”包括“精神的准备和有形的武装”。艾森豪威尔在这里向美国人民暗示，朝鲜战争必须继续下去，因此美国人民应该准备好继续把他们的儿子和丈夫送到朝鲜去充当炮灰。
    艾森豪威尔接着公然透露了他的继续和扩大战争的计划。他说，他这次从朝鲜回来“又有了新的信念，就是加速取得朝鲜的满意解决是可能的”。艾森豪威尔表示，他这种“新的信念”是在会见了侵朝美军总司令克拉克、傀儡李承晚、美国太平洋舰队总司令雷德福和美国派在国民党匪帮中的军事顾问团团长蔡斯以后产生的。为了避免过早地暴露这些会谈的罪恶性质，艾森豪威尔藉口他还没有就任总统和军事秘密，拒绝向美国人民交待这些会谈的具体内容。但是在他“关于将来的一切”所提供的“一些观察”中，人们已经可以看到艾森豪威尔所将要采取的步骤。
    艾森豪威尔在这些“观察”中提出了他的“加速取得朝鲜的满意解决”的办法，这就是：第一，对李承晚伪军的“训练能够扩大与加速，而且也必须这样做”。第二，“早日纠正”“某些供应问题”。据合众社纽约十四日电报道，“消息灵通人士”说，这就是要加速供应“某些种类的大炮与更多的喷气战斗机”。此外，这些人士说，还要更多的直升飞机来“提高”美国飞行员的士气，因为被朝中方面打下来的飞行员要靠这种飞机去救。这一切显然是为发动大规模攻势作准备。艾森豪威尔的最后一点“观察”，就是在“考虑和计划时都应该认识到”，“朝鲜战争对于我们是最剧烈与最痛苦的一个方面”。他在这里暗示，他要用更大的力量投入这个永久打不赢的侵略战争。
    艾森豪威尔的所谓“谋求光荣地结束全球斗争的这一方面的新努力”。就是一个穷凶极恶的战争计划。而艾森豪威尔说，他的朝鲜之行只不过是这种
    “新努力”的“开端”。他赤裸裸地表示他不愿意用谈判来解决朝鲜问题，而要诉诸武力。
    艾森豪威尔就这样在回到美国的第一天，就向美国人民暴露了他是一个十足的骗子。将要下台的杜鲁门在十一日曾经讽刺艾森豪威尔的朝鲜之行只是
    “一种笼络人心的手段”，说他并没有“行得通的办法”。但是艾森豪威尔的欺骗手段决不能“笼络人心”，只会引起美国人民的愤怒，促使他们加强结束朝鲜战争的斗争。杜鲁门已经用他自己的切身体验，预告了这个华尔街的新奴才的命运。
