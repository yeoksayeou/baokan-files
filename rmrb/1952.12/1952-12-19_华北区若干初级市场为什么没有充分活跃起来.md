Why Have Some Primary Markets in North China Not Been Fully Activated?
North China Trade Bureau Communications Group

From October to mid-November, more than 400 commodity exchange meetings were held in counties and towns throughout the North China region, with a total transaction volume of nearly 2 trillion yuan. Through these small commodity exchange meetings, a large amount of agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products of farmers were sold, and many industrial products and means of production were supplied to farmers, making some primary markets gradually active. In some areas, the commodity exchange meetings in primary markets not only fully utilized the leading role of state-owned trade and cooperatives, but also paid attention to absorbing private merchants and giving play to their enthusiasm, thus achieving greater results. According to statistics from 60 primary market exchange meetings in Shanxi Province, the transaction volume of private merchants accounted for 49.97%. Some private merchants tried every means to increase capital and expand their operations, and some private merchants implemented clear and fair pricing, which was welcomed by farmers.

The small commodity exchange meetings in various parts of North China have been successful, but the fact that primary markets in some areas have not been fully activated should attract everyone's attention. According to our understanding, the main reasons why these primary markets have not been activated are:

(1) Failure to fully mobilize private merchants to participate in transactions. Some cadres of state-owned trade and cooperatives in some areas lack a correct understanding of the role of private merchants in activating the market and promoting urban and rural economic prosperity, and even believe that it does not matter whether private merchants participate in commodity exchange meetings, so they are not active in mobilizing and organizing private merchants to participate. In the commodity exchange meetings in Shijiazhuang Prefecture and Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, the transaction volume of private merchants accounted for only 4.3%, which is a clear example.

(2) Some cadres still do not understand the principles and tasks of small commodity exchange meetings. They do not know whether small commodity exchange meetings should focus on wholesale or retail; whether they should focus on cash transactions or contracts and agreements; whether they should focus on promoting industrial products or agricultural and handicraft products. According to statistics from seven commodity exchange meetings in Hebei Province, cash transactions accounted for only 13.05% of the total transaction volume, while contracts and agreements accounted for 86.95%. Xinji Department Store did not seriously implement the principle of wholesale as the main focus, and coupled with the fact that the goods did not meet the needs of the masses, it only sold 6-7 million yuan per day at the exchange meeting, while a small stall of a private merchant sold more than 5 million yuan per day.

(3) Many areas have not combined senior and primary, large and small commodity exchange meetings, nor have they cooperated well with neighboring areas, so that they cannot support each other, and some even interfere with each other, failing to fully meet the purchasing and sales needs of the masses.

(4) Many cadres in charge of commodity exchange meetings do not have a comprehensive understanding of the production and sales situation in their regions, and underestimate the purchasing power of the masses. Therefore, the purchasing and sales plans are too small, and the material preparations are insufficient, resulting in out-of-stock situations at the meetings. Some cadres are fond of grandeur and like to engage in big business, but are unwilling to engage in small business; some commodity exchange meetings put their main efforts on performing operas and holding exhibitions, and relax their leadership in commodity exchange work.

According to the experience of various parts of North China, to hold commodity exchange meetings in small and medium-sized towns and activate primary markets, the following methods should be adopted:

(1) Strengthen leadership and clarify tasks: Each county should, with the local industrial and commercial administrative departments as the main body, absorb state-owned trade, cooperatives, taxation, banks, transportation, industry and commerce federations, and representative private merchants to form a commodity exchange committee to prepare and convene primary market commodity exchange meetings in an organized and led manner. Its task is mainly to solve the purchase and sale problems of small local products, farm tools, fertilizers, livestock, industrial products, and handicraft products through short-distance exchanges, especially to promote local products and locally produced machines and semi-machine-made industrial products. At the same time, it must be combined with the promotion of industrial products movement to meet the supply and marketing needs of the countryside. It is beneficial to hold some small sample exhibitions and various exhibitions with political significance in conjunction with small commodity exchange meetings, but it is not appropriate to use the main force to engage in exhibitions and relax commodity exchanges.

(2) It is very necessary to fully mobilize and organize private merchants, peddlers, and handicraft workers to participate in transactions. In the transaction, the spirit of "taking into account both public and private interests, taking into account both large and small, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit" must be implemented. To this end, it is necessary to educate cadres to resolutely implement the policies of the Party and the People's Government, correctly and actively unite private merchants, and appropriately assist private merchants in overcoming difficulties, realizing purchasing and sales plans, so that they can make profits and be able to operate actively.

(3) In the primary market, commodities and customers meet directly, so retail with spot goods should be the main focus, and according to the actual situation, supplemented by a variety of methods such as futures, deferred payment, spot payment, barter, deposit orders, and consignment sales, and the purchase and sale should be well combined to meet the needs of farmers for "selling more and buying more." State-owned trading companies should resolutely implement the principle of wholesale as the main focus, and cooperatives and private merchants should focus on operating retail business.

(4) Overcome conservative thinking and make good purchasing and sales plans: All localities should, according to local economic conditions, conduct in-depth investigations of farmers' purchasing power and main production and sales conditions, and formulate practical purchasing and sales plans according to the business scope and seasonal characteristics of the primary market. The superior companies of state-owned trade must fully prepare and support the subordinate companies; the superior cooperatives must also support the subordinate cooperatives to ensure that the needs of the masses are fully met.

(5) Appropriately adjust the wholesale and retail price differences, the wholesale starting point and the urban and rural price differences. It is necessary to implement the price policy of small profits and quick sales and taking into account the three aspects of production, transportation, and consumption, and oppose the idea of high prices in promoting local products and industrial products, and the idea of low prices in purchasing industrial products. The principle of "high price for high-quality goods and low price for inferior goods" should be implemented to guide and improve production and overcome the idea of not being willing to purchase non-branded goods.

(6) The funds for small commodity exchange meetings should be taken from the meeting and used for the meeting, taken properly and used sparingly, and strictly prevent extravagance and waste. Therefore, a budget must be made in advance and reported to the higher-level government for approval, and forced apportionment is prohibited.

(7) In order to cooperate with small commodity exchange meetings, the National Bank can appropriately issue small loans, simplify tax procedures, and abolish inappropriate market management methods (such as purchase permits). Market management should be unified under the local industrial and commercial administrative departments, and state-owned trade departments and cooperatives have no right to replace the industrial and commercial administrative departments to manage the market.

    华北区若干初级市场为什么没有充分活跃起来
    华北贸易局通讯组
    从十月到十一月中旬，华北全区共开过县镇初级市场物资交流会四百余次，总计成交额近两万亿元。通过这些小型物资交流会，推销了农民大量的农业、副业产品和土、特产品，供应给农民很多工业品和生产资料，使某些初级市场日渐活跃起来。有些地区的初级市场物资交流会，除了充分发挥国营贸易和合作社的领导作用以外，并且注意吸收私商参加，发挥他们的积极性，因此收到了更大的效果。据山西省六十个初级市场交流会的统计，私商在会上的成交额占百分之四十九点九七。部分私商多方设法增加资金，扩大经营，有的私商实行了明码实价，受到农民的欢迎。
    华北各地的小型物资交流会是有成绩的，但若干地区的初级市场仍未充分活跃起来，应该引起大家的注意。据我们了解，这些初级市场还没有活跃起来的主要原因是：
    （一）没有充分发动私商参加交易。有些地区的国营贸易和合作社的干部，对私商在活跃市场、繁荣城乡经济中的作用缺乏正确认识，甚至认为私商是否参加物资交流会都没有关系，因此就不积极动员和组织私商参加。河北石家庄专区和石家庄市的物资交流会中，私商成交额仅占百分之四点三，就是一个明显的例子。
    （二）若干干部还不明了小型物资交流会的方针和任务。他们不知道小型物资交流会是以批发为主，还是以零售为主；是以现款现货为主，还是以合同、协议为主；是以推销工业品为主，还是以推销农产品和手工业品为主。据河北省七个物资交流会统计，现款现货仅占成交总额百分之十三点零五，合同、协议则占百分之八十六点九五。辛集百货公司没有认真贯彻批发为主的方针，加以商品不适合群众需要，在交流会中每天仅卖六、七百万元，而私商一个小摊每天就卖五百余万元。
    （三）很多地区没有把高级和初级、大型和小型的物资交流会结合起来，也没有和左右四邻很好配合，以致不能互相支持，有的反而互相牵扯，未能充分满足群众的购销要求。
    （四）许多负责物资交流会的干部没有全面了解本区域的产销情况，对群众购买力估计不足，因此，购销计划订得过小，物资准备不足，在会上发生脱销现象。有些干部好大喜功，愿搞大买卖，不愿搞小买卖；有的物资交流会把主要力量放在唱大戏、搞展览上，放松了对于物资交流工作的领导。
    根据华北各地经验，要开好中小城镇物资交流会，活跃初级市场，应采取以下办法：
    （一）加强领导，明确任务：各县应以当地工商行政部门为主，吸收国营贸易、合作社、税务、银行、交通运输、工商业联合会和有代表性的私商参加，组成物资交流委员会，有组织、有领导地准备和召开初级市场物资交流会。它的任务主要是通过短距离交流，解决小土产、农具、肥料、牲畜、工业品、手工业品的购销问题，特别是推销土产品和本地生产的机器与半机器制的工业品，同时必须和推销工业品运动结合起来，以满足农村的供销需要。结合小型物资交流会举办一些小型的样品展览和有政治意义的各种展览，是有好处的，但不宜用主要力量去搞展览，而放松了物资交流。
    （二）充分发动与组织私商、小贩、手工业者参加交易是很必要的。在交易中，必须贯彻“公私兼顾、大小兼顾、互助互利”的精神。为此，要教育干部坚决执行党和人民政府的政策，正确地积极地团结私商，适当地协助私商克服困难，实现购销计划，使他们有利可图，能够积极经营。
    （三）在初级市场上，商品和顾客是直接见面的，因此应以现货零售为主，并根据实际情况，辅之以期货期款、现货期款、以货易货、存实订货、代购代销等多种多样的方式，并使购销很好地结合起来，达到农民“多卖多买”的要求。国营贸易公司应坚决贯彻批发为主的方针，合作社和私商应着重经营零售业务。
    （四）克服保守思想，作好购销计划：各地应根据当地经济情况，深入调查农民购买力及主要产销情况，并按初级市场的经营范围及季节性的特点，作出切合实际的购销计划。国营贸易的上级公司必须充分准备，支持下级公司；上级合作社也必须支持下级社，保证充分满足群众需要。
    （五）适当调整批发与零售差价、批发起点和城乡差价。必须贯彻薄利广销和照顾生产、贩运、消费三方面的价格政策，反对推销土产和工业品中的高价思想，和购买工业品中的低价思想。要实行“优货优价，劣货劣价”的原则，以指导和改进生产，克服不愿采购非名牌货的思想。
    （六）小型物资交流会经费应取之于会，用之于会，取之得当，用之节约，严防铺张浪费。因此，必须事先作出预算，报上一级政府批准，禁止强迫摊派。
    （七）为了配合小型物资交流会，国家银行可以适当发放小额贷款，税收要简化手续，不适当的市场管理办法（如采购证）应予废除。市场管理应统一于当地工商行政部门，国营贸易部门和合作社无权代替工商行政部门去管理市场。
