Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its enlarged 43rd meeting on the evening of the 24th to exchange views on the proposal of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central People's Government Committee to regularly convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels.

The meeting was presided over by Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee. Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai explained the proposal of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In his report, Vice Chairman Zhou first pointed out: According to the provisions of the Common Program, our country's political system is the system of people's congresses. At the beginning of the founding of the country, considering that the People's Liberation War had not yet ended, various basic political and social reforms had not yet been carried out nationwide, and the economy also needed a period of recovery, the system of people's congresses did not yet have the conditions for immediate implementation. Therefore, the Common Program also stipulated that before the convening of the National People's Congress, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, elect the Central People's Government Committee, and entrust it with the functions and powers of exercising state power. Before the convening of local people's congresses, the people's representative conferences of all circles in the locality would gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses. Now, this transitional period has passed, and our country is about to enter a new period of large-scale planned economic construction. In order to adapt to the national tasks of this new period, it is necessary to regularly convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program.

Next, Vice Chairman Zhou gave a detailed account of the domestic situation and international environment of our country. He said: In the past three years, we have achieved great victories on all fronts. Except for Taiwan, the whole country has been liberated, realizing an unprecedented unity in the history of our country. Domestic bandits have been basically eliminated. Through the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements have also been severely打击 [dǎ jī - hit hard, strike]. With the exception of a few ethnic minority areas, land reform has been basically completed throughout the country, realizing the historical mission of eliminating feudalism. The movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has brought our people's struggle against imperialism to a new high, national defense has been greatly strengthened, and the people of the whole country have been universally educated in patriotism. The work of eliminating the remaining privileges and influences of imperialism in the country has been basically completed. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the ideological remolding movement carried out at the same time, have consolidated the leadership of the working class in the economic, political, and ideological fields. While achieving the great victories of these social reform movements and patriotic movements, we have also carried out enormous economic adjustment and production recovery work. Thanks to the correct measures we have taken, the national financial and economic work has been completely unified, the leading position of the state-owned economy has been established, the financial revenue and expenditure has been balanced, and prices have been stabilized. Due to the democratic reforms and production reforms in industrial and mining enterprises, and due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in land reform and agriculture, industrial and agricultural production has generally recovered or exceeded the highest level before the war. All of these have made the national financial and economic situation fundamentally improved earlier than expected. Our country's period of economic recovery has basically ended, and the period of large-scale planned economic construction has arrived. The first national five-year construction plan will begin to be implemented in 1953.

Vice Chairman Zhou then said that less than a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the war of aggression against Korea by US imperialism broke out. In order to defend our country's security, to support the just struggle of the Korean people against aggression, and also to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, our people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to Korea to form the Volunteer Army to fight alongside the Korean People's Army. The people of the whole country also launched a vigorous movement to Resist America and Aid Korea to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In the past two years, our country's economic recovery and transformation work has been carried out under the conditions of the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea. This struggle has not only not caused the interruption of our country's economic recovery and transformation work, on the contrary, the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea has become a great force to mobilize and encourage the people under the banner of patriotism. It guaranteed and promoted the victorious completion of the economic recovery work. Therefore, although US imperialism is currently unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, refuses to immediately stop the Korean War in accordance with the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, and has adopted shameless means to unilaterally suspend the armistice negotiations, and has also manipulated the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution centered on the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" in violation of the Geneva Convention, which in fact is forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and conspiring to expand the war of aggression against Korea. However, the experience of the past two years has proved that the Chinese people are fully capable of carrying out large-scale planned national construction under the conditions of continuing the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea, and achieving great victories in both aspects.

Vice Chairman Zhou finally pointed out that in order to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural and educational construction in the new period, it is necessary to implement the system of people's congresses stipulated in the Common Program, in order to further consolidate people's democracy, so as to fully utilize the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the cause of national construction. Today, when the conditions for convening the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels are already available, we should, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the Common Program, convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels in a timely manner, which are produced by the people using universal suffrage methods, and change the current method of the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress and the local people's representative conferences exercising the functions and powers of the local people's congresses. To this end, the Chinese Communist Party proposes that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference suggest to the Central People's Government Committee, in accordance with the functions and powers stipulated in Article 7, Paragraph 10 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, to convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels in 1953, and to begin preparations such as drafting the election law and the draft constitution.

After Vice Chairman Zhou's report, the committee members present enthusiastically expressed their opinions. Li Jishen, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Ma Xulun, on behalf of the China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Xu Deheng, on behalf of the Jiusan Society, Peng Zemin, on behalf of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Naiqi, on behalf of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Lai Ruoyu, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Yun, on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke successively. They expressed unanimous agreement and warm support for the proposal of the Chinese Communist Party. Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Xiruo, Li Weihan, Lan Gongwu, Xie Juezai, Wang Yunsheng, and Fei Zhendong also unanimously expressed their agreement with the suggestion to regularly convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels in their speeches. Everyone believes that on the basis of the great victories achieved in the past three years, and at the same time as starting large-scale construction, convening the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels is completely correct, timely, and in line with the requirements of the people of the whole country.

Those who attended and were present at the meeting included Zhou Enlai and Li Jishen, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Standing Committee members Li Weihan, Wang Kunlun, Jiang Guangnai, Zhang Naiqi, Ma Xulun, Zhang Xiruo, Yang Xiufeng, Zhu De, Deng Yingchao, and Liang Xi, members Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Chen Shaoxian, Mei Gongbin, Zeng Zhaolun, Sha Qianli, Fu Dingyi, Xu Deheng, Jiang Nanxiang, Lan Gongwu, Zhang Youyu, Deng Xiaoping, He Jifeng, Yi Lirong, Li Fenglian, Shen Zijiu, Wu Han, Zhou Yang, Zheng Zhenduo, Lin Liru, Wang Yunsheng, Pan Zhenya, Huan Xiang, Li Chenggan, Zhu Zaoguan, Zhuang Mingli, Fei Zhendong, Ma Jian, Tao Menghe, Qian Changzhao, Li Shucheng, Chen Jinkun, Huang Shaohong, Fu Zuoyi, and Liang Shuming, members of the Central People's Government Committee Wu Yuzhang, Xu Teli, Peng Zemin, Chen Mingshu, Liu Yazi, and Long Yun, Government Councilors of the State Council Xie Juezai, Zeng Shan, and Teng Daiyuan, as well as heads of various academies, committees, ministries, associations, bureaus, and lines of the Central People's Government, heads of various departments under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and heads of various people's organizations, totaling more than one hundred and ten people.

    中国共产党提议明年召开全国人民代表大会
    中国人民政协全国委员会开常委会交换意见
    周恩来同志代表我党说明提议，各党派、各团体负责人一致表示热烈拥护
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会在二十四日晚扩大举行第四十三次会议，就中国共产党提议由中国人民政治协商会议向中央人民政府委员会提出定期召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的建议交换意见。
    会议由全国委员会李济深副主席主持。周恩来副主席代表中共中央说明中国共产党的提议。周副主席在报告中首先指出：根据共同纲领的规定，我国的政治制度是人民代表大会制度。在建国之初，考虑到人民解放战争还没有结束，各种基本的政治社会改革工作还没有在全国范围内进行，经济也需要一个恢复时期，人民代表大会制度还没有立即实行的条件，因此，共同纲领又规定在全国人民代表大会召开以前，由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行全国人民代表大会的职权，选举中央人民政府委员会，并付之以行使国家权力的职权，而在地方人民代表大会召开以前，则由地方各界人民代表会议逐步代行人民代表大会的职权。现在，这种过渡时期已经过去了，我国即将进入大规模的有计划的经济建设的新时期。为着适应这一新时期的国家任务，就必须根据共同纲领的规定，定期召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。
    接着，周副主席就我们国家的国内形势和国际环境作了详尽的叙述。他说：三年来，我们在各个战线上都取得了伟大的胜利。除台湾外，全国都已解放，实现了我国历史上空前未有的统一。国内土匪已经基本上肃清。经过镇压反革命运动，反革命分子的破坏活动也已受到严重的打击。除少数民族地区外，全国土地改革已经基本上完成，实现了消灭封建主义这个历史使命。抗美援朝运动使我国人民反对帝国主义的斗争达到新的高涨，国防大为加强，全国人民普遍受到爱国主义的教育，在国内肃清帝国主义残余特权及其影响的工作已经基本上完成。“三反”“五反”运动和同时进行的思想改造运动，巩固了工人阶级在经济上、政治上和思想上的领导。在取得这些社会改革运动和爱国运动的伟大胜利的同时，我们还进行了巨大的经济调整和生产恢复的工作。由于我们采取了正确的措施，国家财政经济工作已完全统一，国营经济的领导地位已经确立，财政收支已经平衡，物价已经稳定。由于工矿企业中的民主改革和生产改革，由于土地改革和农业中互助合作运动的发展，工农业生产一般已恢复或超过战前的最高水平。所有这些，使得国家财政经济状况比预料更早地达到根本好转。我国经济恢复时期已经基本结束，大规模的有计划的经济建设时期已经到来，第一个国家五年建设计划就要在一九五三年开始实行了。
    周副主席接着说，在中华人民共和国成立之后不到一年，就发生了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争。为了保卫我国的安全，为了支持朝鲜人民反侵略的正义斗争，也为了维护远东和世界的和平，我国人民派出了自己的优秀儿女组成志愿军前往朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，全国人民也展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动来支援中国人民志愿军。在过去两年中，我国的经济恢复和改造工作是在抗美援朝斗争的条件下进行的。这一斗争非但没有引起我国经济恢复和改造工作的中断，相反地，抗美援朝斗争成为在爱国主义旗帜下动员和鼓舞人民的一个伟大力量，它保证了和促进了经济恢复工作的胜利完成。因此，尽管美帝国主义目前还不愿和平解决朝鲜问题，拒绝按照世界人民的和平愿望立即停止朝鲜战争，而且采取无耻手段片面中止停战谈判，还操纵联合国通过以违反日内瓦公约坚持所谓“自愿遣返原则”实即强迫扣留战俘为中心内容的非法决议案，阴谋扩大侵朝战争。但是，过去两年已有的经验证明：中国人民完全有力量可以在继续抗美援朝斗争的条件下来进行大规模的有计划的国家建设，并且在两个方面都取得伟大的胜利。
    周副主席最后指出，为了适应新时期国家大规模的经济建设、国防建设、文教建设的需要，必须实施共同纲领所规定的人民代表大会制度，以求进一步地巩固人民民主，以便充分发挥人民群众参加国家建设事业的积极性。今天，在召集全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的条件已经具备的时候，我们就应该依照共同纲领第十二条、第十三条、第十四条的规定，及时召开由人民用普选方法产生的全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，改变现在由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行全国人民代表大会职权的办法和地方各界人民代表会议代行地方人民代表大会职权的办法。为此，中国共产党提议由中国人民政治协商会议向中央人民政府委员会建议，根据中央人民政府组织法第七条十款所规定的职权，于一九五三年召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，并开始进行起草选举法和宪法草案等准备工作。
    在周副主席报告后，到会各委员热烈地发表意见。李济深代表中国国民党革命委员会，马叙伦代表中国民主同盟和中国民主促进会，许德珩代表九三学社，彭泽民代表中国农工民主党，章乃器代表中国民主建国会，赖若愚代表中华全国总工会，章蕴代表中华全国民主妇女联合会，相继发言，他们对于中国共产党的提议，表示一致的赞同和热烈的拥护。傅作义、张奚若、李维汉、蓝公武、谢觉哉、王芸生、费振东在发言中对定期召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的建议，也一致表示赞同。大家都认为在三年来所取得的伟大胜利的基础上，在开始大规模建设的同时，召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，是完全正确的，适时的，符合于全国人民要求的。
    出席和列席这次会议的，有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席周恩来、李济深，常务委员李维汉、王昆仑、蒋光鼐、章乃器、马叙伦、张奚若、杨秀峰、朱德、邓颖超、梁希，委员林伯渠、董必武、陈劭先、梅龚彬、曾昭抡、沙千里、符定一、许德珩、蒋南翔、蓝公武、张友渔、邓小平、何基沣、易礼容、李凤莲、沈兹九、吴晗、周扬、郑振铎、林砺儒、王芸生、潘震亚、宦乡、李承干、朱早观、庄明理、费振东、马坚、陶孟和、钱昌照、李书城、陈瑾昆、黄绍竑、傅作义、梁漱溟，中央人民政府委员会委员吴玉章、徐特立、彭泽民、陈铭枢、柳亚子、龙云，政务院政务委员谢觉哉、曾山、滕代远以及中央人民政府各院、委、部、会、署、行的首长，人民革命军事委员会所属各部首长，各人民团体负责人等一百一十余人。
