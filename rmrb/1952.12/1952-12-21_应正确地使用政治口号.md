    Political Slogans Should Be Used Correctly

    To the Editor: On the streets and in the markets, we can often see various daily commodities decorated with political slogans. For example, children's hats, children's bibs, floral pillows, socks, coat hooks, and wrapping paper are all printed or embroidered with phrases such as "Long Live the Great Unity of the Chinese People," "Defend Peace," "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Defend the Nation," etc. This indiscriminate use of political slogans not only undermines the seriousness of political slogans, but also dilutes the political enthusiasm of the masses, and fails to achieve the desired decorative effect.

    Our motherland is a country with a rich heritage of arts and crafts. We should absorb the excellent parts of our national arts and crafts heritage and apply them to handicrafts, daily necessities, and all applied art products. We hope that artists, especially applied artists, will pay attention to this work and improve the artistic decoration of handicrafts and daily necessities.

    应正确地使用政治口号
    编辑同志：在街道上、市场上我们可以经常看到各式各样的日用商品的装饰上有政治标语口号，例如：小孩帽子、小孩围嘴、花枕头、袜子、挂衣钩和包货纸上都印着或绣着“中华人民大团结万岁”、“保卫和平”、“抗美援朝，保家卫国”……字样。这样滥用政治口号，不但破坏了政治口号的严肃性，而且也冲淡了群众的政治热情，更不能得到应有的装饰效果。
    我们祖国是一个具有丰富工艺美术遗产的国家。我们应该吸取民族工艺美术遗产中优良的部分应用在工艺品、日用品和一切实用美术品之上。我们希望美术家们，特别是实用美术家们重视这样的工作，改进手工艺品和日用品的美术装饰。
