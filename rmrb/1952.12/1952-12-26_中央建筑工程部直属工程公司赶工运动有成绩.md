    The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering's Directly Subordinate Engineering Company has achieved significant results since launching its speed-up campaign. In mid-October, the company held a meeting of all employee representatives, deciding to categorize all projects into three types based on urgency: those that must be completed, those that should strive to be completed, and those that will be completed in the following year. A speed-up campaign was then launched. During the campaign, inspection teams were organized to go deep into the construction sites to discover and quickly resolve various problems. Material supply, factory production, labor allocation, and material transportation units all coordinated with the urgent needs of the site as much as possible, based on the principle of focusing resources on key areas. Most construction sites implemented parallel流水作业 (parallel assembly line operations), universally established production contracts, and implemented over-quota reward methods. Under this series of powerful measures, the production enthusiasm of all employees was high, and they fully exerted their initiative to overcome difficulties, enabling the campaign to unfold healthily and vigorously. As of the end of November, among the twenty-five construction sites designated to be completed, only one is likely to become a project completed in the following year; the rest can be completed in the near future. Among the twenty construction sites striving for completion, only six are likely to become projects completed in the following year. Among the construction sites with projects spanning into the following year, some have already overfulfilled this year's tasks, and some are actively striving to complete them.
    The company's leadership has systematically shifted its focus to the completion work at the construction sites. Each construction site is doing a good job in project protection, material and tool storage, on-site safety, labor deployment, final accounting and settlement, and overall summary of the construction site, striving to achieve: "Achieve a thorough victory in the speed-up campaign, and do a good job in the completion work of the construction site." This is to ensure the smooth progress of this year's winter training and next year's large-scale construction tasks.

    中央建筑工程部直属工程公司赶工运动有成绩
    中央建筑工程部直属工程公司，开展赶工运动以来，已获显著成绩。该公司在十月中旬召开了全体职工代表会议，决定把所有工程按先后缓急分为：一定完成、争取完成和跨年度完成三类，并开展赶工运动。在运动中，组织了检查组，深入工地去发现和迅速解决各种问题。材料供应、工厂生产、人工调配、材料运输等单位都根据重点使用力量的原则，尽一切可能来配合现场的急需。大部分工地推行了平行流水作业，普遍订立了生产合同，执行了超额奖励办法。在这一系列有力的措施下，全体职工生产热情高涨，充分发挥了主动克服困难的精神，使运动健康地蓬勃地展开。截至十一月底止，在一定完工的二十五个工地中，只有一个工地可能成为跨年度完成工程，其余的可分别在最近完工。争取完工的二十个工地中，只有六个工地可能成为跨年度完成工程，在跨年度工程的工地中，有些已超额完成了今年的任务，有些正积极争取完成。
    该公司领导重点已有计划地转入工地结束工作。各工地正在做好工程保护、料具保管、现场安全、人工调遣、决算结算以及工地全面总结等工作，争取做到：“赶工得彻底胜利，做好工地结束工作”。以保证今年冬训和明年大规模建设任务的顺利展开。
