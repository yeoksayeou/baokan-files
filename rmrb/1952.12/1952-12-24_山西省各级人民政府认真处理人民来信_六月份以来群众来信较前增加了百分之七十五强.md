Shanxi Province's People's Governments Seriously Handle People's Letters
Since June, the Number of Letters from the Masses Has Increased by Over 75 Percent

Following the handling of the "Zhang Shunyou incident," the People's Governments at all levels in Shanxi Province have attached importance to handling letters and visits from the people. The number of letters written to the People's Government by the people has greatly increased compared to the past. According to statistics from the People's Correspondence Office of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government: Before the "Zhang Shunyou incident" in May of this year, the monthly average of letters and visits from the masses was 200. Since June, the monthly average has been 352, an increase of over 75 percent compared to the past.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government recently inspected the work of handling letters and visits from the people in various regions and believes that the People's Governments at all levels have generally attached importance to this work. Most areas have established procedures and systems for handling letters and visits from the people. Problems raised in letters and visits from the people are generally responded to within about seven days. From the beginning of July to October 25, the People's Correspondence Office of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government had completed the processing and responding to 1,231 problems raised in letters and visits from the people; 139 were transferred to various counties and responsible units for handling; 40 were under investigation and study; 115 were sent to relevant units for reference; and only 4 were temporarily unprocessed due to illegible handwriting, no name, or no mailing address.

Many special commissioner's offices and county people's governments have established systems for registration, transfer, follow-up, inspection, summary reporting, and archiving. The Commissioner of the Linfen Special District stipulated that the 1st of each month is a day for receiving the people; Linfen, Yishi and other counties stipulated that the county head personally receives the people on the 1st and 15th of each month; the Shilu County People's Government compiled and printed "Propaganda Q&A" for the People's Correspondence Office to expand its influence; the Huguan County People's Government stipulated that three days a month are used to specifically study the situation of letters and visits from the people; the Jiaocheng County People's Government established a "Reply Card"; the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government and the People's Correspondence Office of the Provincial People's Government have established a check card system for handling letters from the people. Since July, the "Work Newsletter," a publication of the Provincial People's Government, has launched a discussion on the work of the People's Correspondence Office, in which more than 30 units have participated, which has greatly promoted the work of the People's Correspondence Office in various parts of Shanxi. In the past, there were no clear regulations on expenses such as meals and travel subsidies for receiving visiting people, making it difficult to handle; after the "Zhang Shunyou incident," the Provincial People's Government made special regulations regarding these expenses. The visiting people were very satisfied.

The emphasis placed on the work of letters and visits from the people in various regions has encouraged the enthusiasm of the people, thus promptly reflecting various opinions and requirements. Judging from the letters and visits, the masses currently have the following two opinions on the work of the People's Government:

First, the commandist style of work and privileged thinking of district and village cadres still exist seriously, and it is urgent to strengthen education and make necessary handling of the cadres. For example, Cao Cunzhu, a district cadre in Zuoquan County, held many meetings in Jiuyao Village but did not solve problems. The masses were quite tired after working for a day, but he called meetings every night until after midnight. During the day, the masses went to work in the fields, and he slept soundly. When Wang Yulong, a cadre from Zuoquan County, went to the countryside to mobilize the masses to get vaccinations, he threatened the masses, saying, "Whoever does not get vaccinated is deliberately manufacturing germ warfare for American imperialism." When Li Fengwei, a cadre from Zuoquan County, went to the countryside to organize credit cooperatives, he did not explain the policies to the masses, forced them to buy shares, and said, "Whether you understand the ideology or not, you have to buy in, whether you can afford it or not, you have to contribute." He didn't let the masses sleep until he had collected the shares. In Linfen County, personnel from the Sixth District Dujiachuang Security Committee, on the pretext of controlling more than 60 people in the masses within three months. When a cadre from the Anyi County Committee of the Communist Youth League led the election of village cadres in Banpo Village, two students gave him some suggestions, and he tied up those two students. According to the representatives of the village, he had tied up more than a dozen people in the village in the past, and even crippled a farmer's arm.

Second, in terms of school education. Due to improved living standards and increased political awareness, farmers now generally demand that their children go to school, request the establishment of complete primary schools, require more teachers to be allocated, and demand that primary school textbooks be resolved. The masses also raised opinions on the unified enrollment and allocation of secondary schools. The masses said: Local students cannot study in their own local schools and are allocated to other counties, while students from other counties are allocated to this county. As a result, many students from this county do not go to other counties, and students from other counties do not come to this county, which delays their studies. These issues are being studied and resolved by the People's Governments in various regions.

    山西省各级人民政府认真处理人民来信
    六月份以来群众来信较前增加了百分之七十五强
    “张顺有事件”处理后，山西省各级人民政府重视处理人民来信、来访工作，人民群众向人民政府的写信数量已较过去大为增加。据山西省人民政府人民问事处的统计：在今年五月份“张顺有事件”以前，每月群众来信及来访平均二百件。六月份以后，每月平均有三百五十二件，较过去增加了百分之七十五强。
    山西省人民政府最近检查了各地处理人民来信、来访的工作，认为各级人民政府对这一工作已普遍重视起来。绝大部分地区都已建立了处理人民来信、来访的手续和制度。人民来信、来访中提出的问题，一般都能在七天左右作复。山西省人民政府人民问事处从七月初到十月二十五日所收到的人民群众来信及来访中所提出的问题，已处理完毕并复过本人的有一千二百三十一件；转送各县及主管单位处理的有一百三十九件；正在调查研究的四十件；送有关单位参考的一百一十五件；因字迹模糊、无姓名、无通讯地址而暂时没有处理的仅四件。
    不少专署、县人民政府都建立了登记、转办、催办、检查、总结汇报和存档等制度。临汾专署专员规定每月一日为接见人民群众日；临汾、猗氏等县规定县长在每月初一和十五亲自接见人民群众；石楼县人民政府为扩大人民问事处的影响，编印了人民问事处的“宣传问答”；壶关县人民政府规定每月用三天的时间专门研究人民群众来信、来访的情况；交城县人民政府建立了“批复牌”；太原市人民政府和省人民政府人民问事处都建立了处理人民来信的检查卡片制。省人民政府机关刊物“工作通讯”，从七月份以来开展了关于人民问事处工作问题的讨论，前后共有三十多个单位参加，对山西各地人民问事处的工作发生很大的推动作用。过去接待来访群众，吃饭、补助路费等开支没有明文规定，很难处理；“张顺有事件”以后，省人民政府作出了关于这项开支的专门规定。来访群众十分满意。
    各地重视人民来信、来访的工作，鼓舞了人民群众的积极性，因而及时地反映了各种意见和要求。从来信、来访中看，群众对人民政府的工作，目前有以下两个意见：
    一、区、村干部的强迫命令作风及特权思想仍严重存在，亟须对干部加强教育并作必要的处理。如左权县区干部曹存柱在九腰会村工作时，开会多而不解决问题。群众劳动一天，已相当疲乏，他却每天晚上都召集开会，一开就是多半夜。白天群众下地劳动，他就睡大觉。左权县干部王玉龙下乡发动群众打防疫针时，威胁群众说：“谁不打针就是有意给美帝国主义制造细菌战。”左权县干部李凤维下乡组织信用合作社时，不给群众讲政策，强迫群众入股，并且说：“思想通不通都得入，出起出不起都得出。”搞到半夜，还不许群众睡觉，直到把股集起。临汾县六区杜家庄治安委员会的人员，在三个月中，借故管制了群众六十多人。青年团安邑县委员会的干事在半坡村领导选举村干部时，有两个学生给他提意见，他竟把那两个学生捆了起来。据该村代表反映，过去他曾在该村捆过十余人，甚至把一个农民的胳膊捆成残废。
    二、学校教育方面。农民由于生活改善，政治觉悟提高，现在普遍要求自己的子弟上学，要求增设完全小学，要求更多地配备教员，要求解决小学课本等。群众也对中学实行统一招生分配工作提出了意见。群众说：本地的学生不能在本地上学，拨到外县去，而外县的学生又拨到本县来，结果很多本县的学生不去外县，外县的学生也不来本县，耽误了他们的学习。这些问题，正由各地人民政府研究解决。
