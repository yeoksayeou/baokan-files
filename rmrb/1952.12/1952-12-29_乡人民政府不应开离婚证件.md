    Township People's Government Should Not Issue Divorce Certificates
    Editor: On December 1st, when Zhou Yuying, a woman from Xinmin Township, Zhangming County, Sichuan Province, and Lei Yongzheng from Shima Township in my district, Mianyang County, came to the district People's Government to register their marriage, the cadre in charge of the registration asked the woman about her situation. She said, "I just divorced Chen Yingsong." And she produced a divorce certificate. As a result, it was found that the "divorce certificate" had the words "Zhangming County People's Court" written at the top, but the date at the bottom was stamped with the seal of the Xinmin Township People's Government of Zhangming County, as well as the personal seal of Cao Shiyuan, the cadre who handled the matter in the township. Obviously, this "divorce certificate" was illegal. The cadre in our district then said to Zhou Yuying: "As long as your marriage is voluntary on both sides, the People's Government should register you. But your divorce certificate was issued by the township People's Government. The Marriage Law clearly states that divorce must be handled by the district People's Government. We hope you will go back to the district to complete the divorce formalities before coming back." The woman went back after hearing this. The above situation shows that the comrades of the Xinmin Township People's Government in Zhangming County who handle marriage matters have not correctly implemented the Marriage Law. Furthermore, such arbitrary issuance of divorce certificates will affect the credibility of the People's Government, which is also very inappropriate. We suggest that the Zhangming County People's Government inspect and correct this phenomenon.

    乡人民政府不应开离婚证件
    编辑同志：十二月一日，四川省彰明县新民乡妇女周玉英和绵阳县我区石马乡雷永正来区人民政府登记结婚时，负责办理的干部问女方的情况，她说：“我是刚和陈英松离了婚的。”她并且拿出离婚证来。结果发现那张“离婚证”前面写彰明县人民法院，在后面年月日上却盖着彰明县新民乡人民政府的印，另盖有该乡经手处理的干部曹时远的私章。显然这张“离婚证”不合法。我区干部便向周玉英说：“只要你们的结婚是双方自愿，人民政府是应该给你们登记的。可是你的这张离婚证是乡人民政府办的，婚姻法上说得很明白：离婚须向区人民政府办理。希望你重去区里办理了离婚手续再来。”这一妇女听了就回去了。上述情况，可以说明彰明县新民乡人民政府处理婚姻事件的同志，没有正确执行婚姻法。并且这样任意开离婚证的做法，将影响人民政府的威信，也是很不应该的。我们建议彰明县人民政府检查纠正这种现象。
