    The Chinese People's Volunteers on the Health Front
    Chang Rong
    At the Second National Health Conference, there were representatives from seven model health units of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) from the Korean front and three model health workers. They and their comrades-in-arms, together with the Korean people, not only crushed the American aggressors' germ warfare but also achieved brilliant successes in health and hygiene work.
    In the tense days and nights of combat, the CPV soldiers overcame all kinds of material difficulties and resolutely fought against the heinous germ warfare of the enemy. In order to eliminate the vectors of the germs spread by the enemy, the soldiers launched a vigorous rat extermination and fly eradication campaign. They caught a total of more than 5,154,000 rats, killed more than 5.4 billion flies and mosquitoes, and also killed more than 157,000 poisonous snakes. The Second Company of a certain unit of the CPV, which was rated as a national first-class health model unit, caught more than 89,000 rats and killed more than 2 million pests of various kinds in three months. The soldier Wen JunKui (representative attending the Second National Health Conference, rated as a national first-class health model worker) of this company caught 7,930 rats in the same period, setting a national record for individual rat catching. Wen JunKui talked about their fighting spirit when catching rats. He said: "In May and June this year, the climate in Korea was dry, and the rats near our station disappeared. So we scouted and researched everywhere and found that the rat tracks were all running towards a mountain on the opposite side, and there was a river on the other side of the mountain. We judged that the rats must have run across the mountain to drink water. So we tracked and pursued them for fifty li, and set up a dense rat-catching 'firepower network' on the mountains and fields by the river, and achieved great results. I personally caught more than 150 rats every day."
    In order to catch rats and eradicate flies, the soldiers used the gaps in combat and training, and used all kinds of materials that could be obtained to create 2,220,000 effective rat-catching and fly-killing tools. They created a kind of rat-catching slate, which could be made with just a slate, a rope and a few small wooden sticks. It was simple to manufacture and had good results. When making tools, if there were no ropes, they tore their torn clothes into strips to use. In order to save money, they also used elm bark to make ropes to replace cloth strips. Many units put forward the slogan "Wherever people go, they catch rats and kill flies there." The Eighth Company of a certain unit of the CPV (national third-class health model unit), which was guarding the front-line position, still used slates, small tanks, rat traps, wooden cages, etc. to catch 392 rats and kill 340,000 mosquitoes and flies, even though it was in a tense war environment. The Zhanqin Company of a certain unit of the CPV (national third-class health model unit), which participated in the first, second, third and fourth battles, and recently also participated in the Battle of Shangganling, also caught more than 500 rats while completing its combat tasks. Company Commander Xie Youquan (the unit representative of the company attending the Second National Health Conference) said: "We are fighting American devils on the one hand, and catching rats and killing flies on the other, because Truman has added rats and flies to his barracks."
    The CPV soldiers' personal hygiene and the environmental sanitation of their stations have also been greatly improved in the anti-germ warfare struggle. The soldiers carefully built many "position homes" that were not only strong and shaded but also clean and beautiful. Some units planted tender pine trees and flowers at the entrance of the living quarters and parade ground, and some even built fish ponds. The Third Squad of the Second Company of the First Battalion of a certain unit (rated as a national second-class health model unit) modeled a pair of beautiful lions after the style of the lions in front of Tiananmen Square and squatted at the gate. The soldiers said: Seeing these lions, it's like seeing the motherland!
    Inside the barracks and positions, the walls of the bedrooms were plastered with lime or white clay, and the walls were hung with charts or photos of the motherland's construction in various aspects, and some were also pasted with peace doves. The soldiers made their own high bunks, so they were not afraid of dampness. In winter, they built warm kang to resist the cold. They used captured enemy parachutes and flour sacks to make gauze and install them on doors and windows to prevent mosquitoes and flies. They made covered spittoons out of tin cans or stones. Xu Zhen, the storekeeper of a certain large station (national third-class health model unit), created a kind of spittoon, which automatically opened when you stepped on the lid, which was very convenient to use. The Second Company of a certain unit made spittoons in the shape of tanks and cars out of egg powder boxes and wood chips, which were both convenient and beautiful. The soldiers said: "The motherland's construction is developing every day, and we can't fall behind!" Many troops have set up bathhouses and converted gasoline barrels into shower equipment. The Eighth Company of a certain unit of the CPV, which was guarding near the 38th parallel, built a pond in the tunnel that could hold 80 dan of water, and could accommodate a dozen people to take a bath at a time. In the gaps between battles, the soldiers often carried water three or four li away to take a bath. The stretcher company of a certain unit, which recently participated in the Battle of Shangganling, generally insisted on the system of taking a bath on time during the nine days and nights of tense tasks. Not a single patient occurred in the entire company.
    The soldiers paid special attention to the hygiene of kitchens, toilets, stables and other places. The kitchen generally has a cooking room, a fire room, a washing room and a storage room. The rooms are all plastered with lime or white clay. All utensils and food are covered with covers. The cooks are equipped with white work clothes and masks, which are steamed and washed once a day. On the front-line positions, the soldiers built toilets that could both avoid enemy shells and were hygienic. The toilets in the rear garrisons were built as well as those in the cities. The toilet built by the Second Company of a certain unit was equipped with an automatically opening and closing dung pit cover. When a person stood on the toilet, the cover could automatically open. All units with horses built clean stables. The stables of some units were paved with wooden boards and sprinkled with fine sand and ash, and there was no smell at all, which ensured the health of people and horses.
    While carrying out sanitation and cleaning campaigns, the CPV units also improved their food. The cooking classes of many units regularly held meetings to study cooking techniques and listen to the opinions of the masses, and constantly improved the food. For a period of time, the instructor of the First Company of a certain unit (national second-class health model unit) lived in the cooking class and personally guided the work of improving the food, and realized the plan of "changing the large stove to a medium stove." The cooking class of the Eighth Company of a certain unit held a food improvement research meeting and a hygiene review meeting once a week, and formulated the menu for the next week, so that the soldiers' food was both nutritious and palatable. Many units made their own tofu and sprouted soybeans, and used the soybeans transported by the people of the motherland to make a variety of delicious foods to eat. The soldiers received a variety of nutritious foods supplied by the people of the motherland, and also used the gaps in combat to find open spaces to reclaim wasteland and grow vegetables. The vegetables grown by the Eighth Company of a certain unit can be eaten until April next year. A certain large station harvested more than 70,000 jin of vegetables grown by itself, which can be eaten until March next year. Due to the improvement of nutrition, the soldiers are all strong and healthy. The soldiers of a certain large station gained an average of 2.35 jin in weight in one month, and the most gained 6 jin. The Second Company of the First Battalion of a certain unit gained an average of 4.2 jin in weight per person in seven months.
    In addition, the CPV soldiers also assisted the local Korean people in carrying out local health work. They and the local residents jointly established health organizations, helped the Korean people improve environmental sanitation, and provided them with free medical treatment. For example, a certain large station helped the local residents relocate more than 180 cowsheds, pigsties and toilets, cleared a large amount of garbage, and also gave more than 13,000 residents preventive injections and treated diseases. Local women spontaneously organized to wash clothes for the soldiers. The joint operation of the Chinese and Korean people on the health front ensured the victory of the anti-germ warfare and greatly enhanced the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

    志愿军在卫生战线上
    长荣
    在第二届全国卫生会议上，有来自朝鲜前线的志愿军七个卫生模范单位的代表和三名卫生工作模范。他们和他们的战友们及朝鲜人民在一起，不独粉碎了美国侵略者的细菌战，在保健卫生工作上也取得了辉煌成就。
    在战斗紧张的日日夜夜里，志愿军战士们克服了种种物质上的困难，坚决和敌人万恶的细菌战作斗争。战士们为了扑灭敌人撒播细菌的媒介物，展开了轰轰烈烈的捕鼠灭蝇运动。他们共捕鼠五百一十五万四千多只，灭蝇蚊等五十四亿个以上，还打杀了毒蛇十五万七千余条。被评为全国甲等卫生模范单位的志愿军某部二连，在三个月中就捕鼠八万九千多只，扑杀各种害虫二百余万个。这个连的战士文俊奎（出席第二届全国卫生会议代表，被评为全国甲等卫生工作模范），在同一时期内捕鼠七千九百三十只，创全国个人捕鼠最高纪录。文俊奎谈到了他们捕鼠时的战斗精神。他说：“今年五、六月，朝鲜的气候干燥，我们驻地附近的老鼠都不见了。我们就四出侦察和研究，发现鼠迹都是朝对面的一座山跑，而山那边有一条河。我们判断老鼠一定是跑过山那边去喝水了。于是便跟踪追击，追了五十里路，在河边的山上和田野里安设了密集的捕鼠‘火力网’，获得了很大战果。我一个人每天捕鼠都在一百五十只以上。”
    为了捕鼠灭蝇，战士们利用战斗、练兵的空隙时间，利用可以取得的各种材料，创制了各种有效的捕鼠灭蝇工具二百二十二万件。他们创造了一种捕鼠石板，只要一块石板、一根绳子和几根小木棍就能做成，制造简单，而效果很好。制造工具时没有绳子，他们把破衣服撕成碎条来用。为了节约，又用榆树皮制成绳子、代替布条。许多单位提出了“人到那里，就到那里捕鼠灭蝇”的口号。守卫在前沿阵地的志愿军某部八连（全国丙等卫生模范单位），虽然处在紧张的战争环境里，仍用石板、小缸、鼠夹、木笼等捕鼠三百九十二只，灭蚊蝇三十四万个。曾参加一、二、三、四次战役，最近又参加上甘岭战斗的志愿军某部战勤连（全国丙等卫生模范单位），在紧张地完成战斗任务的同时，也捉到了老鼠五百只以上。连长解友全（该连出席第二届全国卫生会议的单位代表）说：“我们一方面打美国鬼子，一方面要捕鼠灭蝇，因为杜鲁门把耗子、苍蝇都补充到他的兵营里了。”
    志愿军战士们的个人卫生和驻地的环境卫生，也在反细菌斗争中大大改进了。战士们精心修筑了许多不但是坚固、荫蔽而且是清洁、美丽的“阵地之家”。有些单位的住室和操场门口，种有青嫩的松树和花草，有的还修了鱼池。某部一营二连（被评为全国乙等卫生模范单位）三班仿照天安门前狮子的式样塑了一对美丽的狮子，蹲坐在大门口。战士们说：看见这对狮子，就好像看到了祖国！
    在营房、阵地内部，卧室的墙壁都用石灰或白土刷过，墙上挂着祖国各方面建设的挂图或照片，有的还贴着和平鸽子。战士们自己做了高铺，不怕潮湿。冬天修了暖炕，抵御寒冷。他们用缴获的敌人降落伞和面袋布做纱布装在门窗上，杜绝蚊蝇。他们用罐头盒或石头做了有盖的痰盂。某大站（全国丙等卫生模范单位）保管员徐真创造的一种痰盂，脚一踏盖子就自动启开，用时很方便。某部二连用蛋粉盒和木片做成坦克型、汽车型的痰盂，又方便，又好看。战士们说：“祖国建设每天都在发展，我们也不能落后呀！”许多部队都设置了澡塘，用汽油桶改制成淋浴设备。守卫在三八线附近的志愿军某部八连，在坑道里修建了池塘，可容水八十担，
    一次能容十数人洗澡。在战斗的空隙里，战士们常到三、四里外担水洗澡。最近参加上甘岭战斗的某部担架连，在九天九夜的紧张任务中，一般都坚持了按时洗澡的制度。全连没有发生过一个病号。
    战士们特别重视厨房、厕所、马棚等这些地方的卫生。厨房一般都设有煮饭间、烧火间、淘洗间和储藏间。室内都用石灰或白土粉刷。所有用具和食物都用罩子罩起。炊事员都备有白色的工作服和口罩，每天蒸洗一次。在前沿阵地，战士们修建了既能躲避敌人炮弹，又合卫生的厕所，后方驻地的厕所，修得和城市里的一样好。某部二连修的厕所，设有自动启闭的粪坑盖，人往大便池上一站，盖子便能自动打开。凡有马匹的单位，都筑起了洁净的马厩。有的单位的马厩铺有木板，撒着细沙和灰，闻不到一点臭味。保障了人马的健康。
    在开展卫生、清洁运动的同时，志愿军各单位都改善了伙食。许多单位的炊事班定期召开会议研究烹调技术，并听取群众意见，不断改进伙食。某部一连（全国乙等卫生模范单位）的指导员，有一个时期就住在炊事班里，亲自指导改进伙食的工作，实现了“变大灶为中灶”的计划。某部八连的炊事班每周召开伙食改善研究会、卫生检讨会各一次，并订出下周食谱，使战士们的食物既富营养，又适口。许多单位自己做豆腐、生豆芽，把祖国人民运去的大豆做成多种可口的食品来吃。战士们收到了祖国人民供应的各种营养丰富的食品，还利用战斗空隙找空地开荒种菜。某部八连自种的青菜可吃到明年四月。某大站自种蔬菜收了七万余斤，能吃到明年三月。由于营养的改善，战士们个个身强体壮。某大站的战士在一个月中平均增加体重二点三五斤，最多的增加了六斤。某部一营二连在七个月中平均每人增加了体重四点二斤。
    此外，志愿军战士们还协助驻地朝鲜人民开展地方卫生工作。他们和驻地居民共同建立卫生组织，帮助朝鲜老百姓改善环境卫生，免费给他们治病。如某大站帮助驻地居民迁移了牛棚、猪圈和厕所等一百八十多个，清除了大量垃圾，还给一万三千多居民施行了防疫注射和诊治疾病。当地妇女就自动组织起来给战士们洗衣服。中朝人民在卫生战线上的共同作战，保证了反细菌战的胜利，也大大增进了中朝人民的友谊。（附图片）
