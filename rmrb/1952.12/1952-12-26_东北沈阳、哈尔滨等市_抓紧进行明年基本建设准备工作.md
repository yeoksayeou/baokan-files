Northeast China's Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun and other cities are planning and step by step preparing for next year's basic construction work.

In addition to establishing or expanding basic construction organizations, allocating cadres, and enriching strength, the cities are also stepping up preparations in terms of planning, design, construction, and labor force. While the current year's projects in Shenyang have not yet been completed, the city's People's Economic Planning Committee has urged units with basic construction tasks for next year to submit financial, material, and transportation plans, so that all preparations for projects directly under the central government, Northeast-level agencies, and city-owned projects that require local assistance are incorporated into a unified plan. While formulating the plan, the city organized manpower to prepare bulk materials and allocate them at any time as winter storage for various construction units. As of December 12, the material plans of most units have been sent to the Municipal People's Economic Planning Committee. Changchun Construction Engineering Bureau has drawn more than 60 design personnel from various construction units to establish Changchun Design Company, which is currently engaged in complex engineering design and standard design of warehouses and canteens. In order to solve the problem of insufficient design manpower in Shenyang, in addition to dividing the production of standard designs with other provinces and cities for mutual exchange to reduce some design tasks, the city's design company uses methods such as increasing assistants and promoting design instruction charts to implement rhythmic production to ensure the completion of arduous design tasks. Before the design, the Lvda Design Company studied the Soviet design standards and criticized the past idea of ​​purely pursuing aesthetics. All designers have improved their understanding of the importance of adopting standard designs and geological surveys. According to the specific requirements of the tentatively determined construction task units, the Harbin Municipal People's Government is actively preparing raw materials. At present, most places have signed contracts with the production department for material storage and transportation. In terms of worker and cadre preparation, Shenyang conducts formal education for more than 20,000 fixed technical workers; for more than 20,000 semi-fixed workers and scattered workers, the district construction trade unions are responsible for organizing spare time study. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Construction Trade Union and other departments have held training courses to train party, trade union, and construction management cadres on the construction site. All units attach great importance to the winter training work. In order to facilitate centralized training and solve the problem of workers' accommodation, the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has rushed to build a four-story building that can accommodate thousands of workers. The director of the Construction Engineering Bureau serves as the general captain of the winter training, and the managers of the companies serve as the captains. Party, Youth League, trade union and other departments have sent cadres to assist in the work. Harbin has fixed more than 20,000 workers, and organized unregistered construction workers in various districts to register to solve the problem of labor shortage. The first stage (political education) of the city's fixed workers' winter training work began in early December. In order to do a good job in winter training, the Lvda Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China specially transferred more than 200 cadres for centralized training as instructors for winter training.

    抓紧进行明年基本建设准备工作
    东北沈阳、哈尔滨、长春等市正有计划、有步骤地进行明年基本建设的准备工作。
    各市除已建立或扩充基本建设机构、调配干部，充实力量外，在计划、设计、施工、劳动力等方面，都正抓紧进行准备工作。沈阳市在今年工程尚未结束时，该市人民经济计划委员会就催促明年有基本建设任务的单位提出财务、材料、运输等计划，以使需要地方协助的直属中央、东北一级机关的工程和市属工程的一切准备工作，都纳入统一的计划。在制订计划的同时，该市就组织人力，准备大宗的材料，并随时调拨出去，作为各施工单位的冬季储存。到十二月十二日为止，大多数单位的材料计划已送到市人民经济计划委员会。长春市建筑工程局已从各施工单位抽调六十多名设计人员，成立了长春设计公司，目前正进行复杂的工程设计和仓库、食堂的标准设计。沈阳市为解决设计人力不足的问题，除和各省、市分工制作标准设计，互相换用，减轻一部分设计任务外，该市设计公司利用增加助手、推行设计指示图表实行有节奏生产等办法，保证完成艰巨的设计任务。旅大设计公司在进行设计之前学习了苏联设计标准，批评了过去单纯追求美观的思想，所有设计人员对采用标准设计和地质勘察的重要性，都提高了认识。哈尔滨市人民政府根据初步确定施工任务单位的具体要求，积极进行原材料准备，目前大部地方已经与生产部门签订合同进行材料储运。在工人和干部准备方面，沈阳市对已固定的两万多技术工人，进行正规教育；对两万多半固定的工人和分散工人，由各区建筑工会负责组织业余学习。中共沈阳市委、市建筑工会等部门都举办训练班，专门训练工地的党、工会、施工管理干部。各单位对冬训工作都很重视，市建筑工程局为便于集中训练及解决工人住宿问题，已经赶造起一幢能容几千工人住宿的四层大楼。由建筑工程局局长担任冬训总队长，各公司经理担任大队长。党、团、工会等部门都派干部协助工作。哈尔滨市已固定两万多工人，并在各区组织未固定的建筑工人进行登记，解决劳动力不足的问题。该市固定工人冬训工作的第一阶段（政治教育），已于十二月初开始。为搞好冬训工作，中共旅大市委特抽调二百多名干部集中训练，作为冬季训练的辅导员。
