    We Must Learn from the Spirit of Model People's Policeman, Martyr Zhang Guofu
    To the Editor: The heroic and exemplary behavior of Chongqing City People's Policeman, Martyr Zhang Guofu, in loving the people and sacrificing himself, has profoundly educated us. Such a people's policeman, nurtured by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who consistently adhered to his duties, worked actively, observed discipline, and maintained close ties with the masses, has become our shining example. The reason why Comrade Zhang Guofu worked and was so heroic was inseparable from his noble qualities of loving the motherland and loving the people, and because he deeply recognized the sacred task of the people's police to defend the construction of the motherland and protect the interests of the people. This is exactly how Chairman Mao taught us, but we have not done it well. We sincerely express: We must learn from the example of Martyr Zhang Guofu.

    To the Editor: The great image of Model People's Policeman, Martyr Zhang Guofu, will forever live in the hearts of the people, and his exemplary deeds will forever inspire every people's policeman. Martyr Zhang Guofu has already established an extremely glorious banner for us, the people's police. We should learn from the martyr's noble quality of serving the people wholeheartedly to mourn the martyr. I am a public security officer, and under the leadership and education of the Party, the Youth League, and the administration for three years, and through a series of patriotic movements, my awareness has been raised. I have realized that the task of being a people's policeman is significant and glorious. Only by faithfully serving the people can we be worthy of them. But upon examination, I still have shortcomings such as being careless in my work and not studying hard enough, and I still have selfish thoughts and other errors. I am determined to overcome my shortcomings and correct my errors in the movement to learn from Martyr Zhang Guofu.

    To the Editor: I was very moved after reading the "Order of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government on posthumously recognizing Martyr Zhang Guofu as a Model People's Policeman" published in the People's Daily on December 12th. Martyr Zhang Guofu's noble and excellent quality of serving the people was produced through his active work and study under the cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao. I am also a public security worker, but I still have many shortcomings and bad habits in my work and study. In the future, I will definitely do my best to learn from Martyr Zhang Guofu and repay the Party and Chairman Mao for their cultivation of me with practical actions.

    我们要学习模范人民警察张国富烈士的精神
    编辑同志：重庆市人民警察张国富烈士热爱人民的自我牺牲的英勇模范行为，深刻地教育了我们。这样一个在共产党、毛主席教养下的一贯忠于职守、积极工作、遵守纪律并密切联系群众的人民警察，已成了我们的光辉榜样。张国富同志之所以这样工作、这样英勇，是和他的热爱祖国、热爱人民的高贵品质分不开的，也因为他深切地认识了人民警察对保卫祖国建设、保卫人民利益的神圣任务。毛主席正是这样教导我们，然而我们没有很好地这样做。我们衷心地表示：我们一定要学习张国富烈士的榜样。

    编辑同志：模范人民警察张国富烈士的伟大形象，将永远活在人民心里，他的模范事迹将永远鼓舞着每一个人民警察。张国富烈士已经为我们人民警察树立了一面极其光辉的旗帜，我们当学习烈士的全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，以悼念烈士。我是一个公安人员，三年来在党、团和行政的领导教育下，经过一连串的爱国运动，我的觉悟提高了。我已认识到做一个人民警察，任务是重大的，同时也是光荣的，只有忠实地为人民服务才对得起人民。但检查起来，我在工作中还有着粗枝大叶、钻研不够的缺点，在思想上还有着自私自利等错误。我决在学习张国富烈士的运动中，克服我的缺点，纠正我的错误。
    天津市公安局八分局  战长昇
    编辑同志：看了十二月十二日人民日报刊载的“中央人民政府公安部关于追认张国富烈士为模范人民警察的命令”，使我非常感动。张国富烈士这种高贵的为人民服务的优良品质，是他在党和毛主席的培养下，经过积极工作和学习而产生的。我也是公安工作人员，但我在工作中、学习中还存在着很多缺点和不良作风。今后我一定尽最大努力向张国富烈士学习，用实际行动来报答党、毛主席对我的培养。
