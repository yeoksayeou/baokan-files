During the winter training period, it is imperative to vigorously promote advanced experiences
Fu Zhensheng, Deputy Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Special Correspondent of this newspaper

    This year's basic construction projects have entered the final stage, and the winter training for basic construction personnel is about to begin. During the winter training period, how to correctly summarize some outstanding advanced experiences that have emerged in this year's basic construction, and further study and promote these advanced experiences to prepare more favorable conditions for next year's basic construction, is a very important issue.

    Based on the situation of Jilin Province's promotion of advanced experiences in basic construction this year, we have experienced that promoting advanced experiences is an important method to complete basic construction tasks. Therefore, we must continue to vigorously promote advanced experiences during this winter training period.

    This year, the basic construction projects in Jilin Province as a whole have been arduous, and the state's investment in civil construction, mechanical installation, well construction projects, and drilling is very large. However, this year, due to insufficient preparation work at the beginning of the year, and the late start of both design and construction (generally starting in late July to early August), the entire construction period was shortened. In addition, we lacked sufficient experience in leading large-scale basic construction work. Therefore, the magnitude of the task and the inadequacy of subjective forces became the main contradiction.

    How to solve this contradiction, so as to ensure the completion of the national task in a relatively short construction period, was an urgent problem placed before the Party, government, trade unions, and the Youth League at that time. The solution to this problem, in addition to mobilizing the masses to expose various phenomena of no one being responsible and establishing various responsibility systems, mainly relied on mobilizing the masses and promoting advanced experiences to improve technical levels, accelerate the progress of the project on the basis of ensuring project quality, and ensure on-time completion.

    This year's facts have proved that, thanks to the efforts of all employees, especially advanced producers, and the strengthening of leadership by Party, government, trade union, and Youth League leading departments at all levels, and the vigorous promotion of advanced experiences, we were able to complete the state's basic construction plan on schedule within a relatively short period of time. As of mid-November, the province has completed 96 percent of the projects, and external operations have basically ended, and internal operations can be fully completed by the end of November. Other mechanical installation, well construction projects, and drilling projects will continue to operate in winter and can also guarantee the completion of tasks by the end of the year.

    This year, based on the learning and promotion of advanced experiences such as Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, and Yang Dezhong, 877 advanced groups of various types have emerged throughout the province. These groups used more advanced tools, adopted more advanced operating methods, and improved labor organization, which greatly improved labor efficiency and shortened the construction period, enabling the province to successfully complete the annual plan. Among these advanced groups and advanced units, some outstanding models have emerged and created some outstanding experiences.

    In bricklaying: Zhang Chunhua's advanced bricklaying team of Changchun Construction Company, based on learning Su Changyou's new bricklaying method, also learned the Soviet Maksimenko's "continuous construction method" and created the "double-handed slurry-squeezing continuous cycle bricklaying method." This bricklaying method, when demonstrated, can lay 8,100 bricks per person per day working eight hours. The actual operation averages 2,800 bricks per day, which is twice as efficient as the segmented bricklaying method. The entire team completed the construction task of 1.8 million bricks in 60 days, saving 778 man-days. In Jilin City, Wang Xilin's advanced bricklaying team of the Electromechanical Plumbing Engineering Team of the Light Industry Administration Bureau of the Northeast People's Government, based on learning from Su Changyou's experience, transformed the mortar spreader into a "water-spraying grouting machine," combining two processes into one, reducing heavy labor and improving efficiency, so that the average bricklaying efficiency per person per day reached 2,800 bricks, exceeding the original quota by 50 percent, and increasing efficiency by 254 percent compared to the old bricklaying method.

    In plastering: Liu Jingshan's advanced plastering team of Changchun Construction Company learned the Guo Valyov work method and Yang Dezhong's plastering assembly line method. The entire team scientifically divided labor according to technical level, clarified operating responsibilities, and created and improved 13 kinds of tools, which greatly improved labor efficiency. In the past, first- and second-class technicians could plaster 15 to 16 square meters per person per day, but now an ordinary worker can plaster 55 square meters and ensure quality. The entire team completed the plastering task of 30,000 square meters in 60 days, saving more than 1,000 man-days.

    In pointing: Ni Yongchun's team of Changchun Industrial Bureau Construction Company created a double-toothed pointing tool, which increased work efficiency by 174 percent. In the past, general technicians could only point 30 to 40 meters per day, but now apprentices can point more than 65 meters per day and ensure quality.

    In carpentry: Wang Chaoxuan's advanced carpentry team of the Third Engineering Office of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department learned Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method and created 11 kinds of tools, which increased work efficiency by more than 100 percent.

    In concrete operations: Under the help and guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Konstantinovich, the 21st Engineering Company of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department implemented the concrete vacuum operation method, which opened up a new path for concrete operations.

    In terms of construction methods: Six units implemented parallel assembly line operation methods. The four thousand square meter two-story workers' dormitory built by Jilin Provincial Engineering Company was originally planned to be constructed in 70 days. After adopting the parallel assembly line operation method, it was completed in 30 days, saving a lot of labor and 563.98 million yuan of wealth.

    In design: The third group of the design section of Changchun Construction Company implemented the "design assembly line operation method," which increased efficiency by 98 percent compared to single-person design. The advantage of implementing the design assembly line operation method is that the work is concentrated, which can give full play to the ability of technical personnel, the business is specialized, the responsibility is clear, the work is easy to familiarize with and improve, and it can also supervise and check each other and strengthen the overall concept.

    These advanced experiences are very valuable. If they can be universally promoted in the national basic construction cause, it will greatly improve work efficiency and accelerate the speed of national industrialization.

    At present, there are many difficulties and contradictions in our basic construction work. The main contradiction is still that the task is very arduous, while the subjective strength is very weak. Whether it is the strength of geological exploration, the strength of design, or the strength of construction, it is far from meeting the needs of large-scale economic construction. These difficulties are almost concentrated on one point, that is, our technical strength is both insufficient and relatively backward.

    In the past, the production method of basic construction was relatively backward. The labor organization had the nature of handicraft industry, the connection between each other was not close enough, and a worker had to complete almost the entire process of a job. This made it difficult to give play to the role of collective labor and difficult to improve the technical level. In terms of production tools, many of them still have primitive characteristics, and have been passed down for almost thousands of years. The backwardness of production tools has greatly hindered the improvement of labor efficiency. In terms of operating methods, there are many workers who still use the old operating methods that have been passed down for a long time, which hinders the improvement of productivity. This situation could barely be maintained in the past when the basic construction task was small, but today the situation has fundamentally changed, and the old technical level can no longer meet today's needs. The solution to this problem is to vigorously promote advanced experiences, improve labor organization, improve production tools, and improve operating methods. These reforms, when combined, are a reform in the entire basic construction production method.

    However, according to the current situation in Jilin Province, the promotion of advanced experiences in the basic construction sector is not widespread enough, not deep enough, and not balanced enough. The groups that adopt advanced experience operations account for only 45.1% of the total number of on-site construction groups. Among them, the advanced bricklaying groups account for 44.7% of the total number of bricklaying groups; the advanced plastering groups account for 57.8% of the total number of plastering groups; the advanced carpentry groups account for 42.1% of the total number of carpentry groups; and the proportion of advanced groups in concrete, excavation, pointing, stone masonry, water and heating, electrical, mechanical installation, etc. does not exceed the above average percentage. This situation shows that a considerable number of groups are almost still at a backward technical level. In terms of the depth of promoting advanced experiences, some units have promoted them better, and the workers are extremely interested in learning advanced experiences. Due to the adoption of advanced experiences, labor efficiency has been improved, income has been increased, and the personal interests and national interests have become more consistent. For example, Zhang Chunhua's advanced bricklaying team, technicians averaged 18.9 points per day, medium-level workers (calculated according to level 4 workers) got 14.73 points, and new apprentices got 8.26 points. The quota for Liu Jingshan's advanced plastering team is 15 square meters, second-level workers get 17 points, fourth-level workers get 13 points, and apprentices get 8 points, but their second-level workers actually get 41.20 points, fourth-level workers actually get 31.59 points, and apprentices actually get 19.48 points. In addition, some units have not promoted advanced experiences deeply enough, and have not taken root among the workers; some are tiger-headed and snake-tailed, and abandoned halfway; some places still have relatively serious formalism, and promote advanced experiences to decorate the facade; some units have learned to manufacture some new tools, but put them aside and do not use them, and still use old tools and follow old methods in actual operation.

    In terms of leadership, there are still some laissez-faire phenomena in the promotion of advanced experiences, and the planning and organization are still insufficient. Some units have insufficient understanding of the great significance of promoting advanced experiences, and believe that "promoting advanced experiences can complete the task, and not promoting advanced experiences can also complete the task."

    "Adopting advanced experiences is also OK, and not adopting advanced experiences is also OK." Because the leadership has adopted an insufficiently serious attitude, the movement to promote advanced experiences in some units has fallen into a spontaneous, unorganized, and leaderless state.

    In order to further universally promote advanced experiences and welcome next year's large-scale basic construction tasks, we must overcome the shortcomings in this year's advanced experience promotion movement, and first of all, we must overcome some shortcomings in leadership.

    This winter training is a major military training for basic construction. How to strengthen political education in the training, improve the political and ideological level of employees, how to correctly summarize this year's advanced experiences, and universally promote outstanding experiences of decisive significance in various types of work to improve the technical level of permanent workers is a very important task.

    The Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions convened the Provincial Basic Construction Advanced Producers Representative Conference in mid-November, initially summarized the advanced experiences of this year's basic construction, fully exchanged opinions, made typical introductions, and commended and rewarded various advanced groups and advanced producers. This has greatly promoted the further promotion of advanced experiences. In order to exchange experiences from various places throughout the province, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions also organized representatives of various outstanding groups to go to various engineering units to make typical introductions to employees of the same type of work during the training period. This is also a relatively effective method.

    冬训期间必须大力推广先进经验
    中共吉林省委副书记本报特约记者  富振声
    今年的基本建设工程已进入结尾阶段，对基本建设工作人员的冬季整训工作即将开始。在冬季整训期间，如何正确地总结今年基本建设中出现的一些突出的先进经验，并进一步学习与推广这些先进经验，为明年基本建设准备更有利的条件，是一个很重要的问题。
    根据吉林省今年推广基本建设先进经验的情况，我们体验到推广先进经验是完成基本建设任务的重要方法，所以在今年冬季整训期间必须继续大力推广先进经验。
    今年吉林省全省的基本建设工程，任务是艰巨的，国家在土木建筑、机械安装、井建工程和钻探方面的投资额十分巨大。但是今年由于年初准备工作做得不够，设计与施工均动手较晚（七月末至八月初才普遍开工），致使整个施工期间缩短，再加上我们对领导大规模基本建设工作缺乏足够的经验，因此，任务的重大与主观力量的不足就成了主要的矛盾。
    如何解决这一矛盾，以便在比较短促的施工期中保证完成国家任务，这是当时摆在党、行政、工会、青年团面前的迫切问题。解决这个问题的办法，除了发动群众揭发各种无人负责现象，建立各种责任制之外，主要还是依靠发动群众，推广先进经验，以提高技术水平，在保证工程质量的基础上加速工程进度，保证按时竣工。
    今年的事实证明，由于全体职工，特别是先进生产者的努力，以及各级党、行政、工会、青年团领导部门对这一工作加强了领导，大力推广了先进经验，才使我们能在比较短促的时间内，按期完成国家的基本建设计划。截至十一月中旬止，全省已完成工程百分之九十六，外部作业已基本结束，内部作业十一月末可全部完成。其他机械安装、井建工程和钻探工程，冬季仍继续作业，年底也能保证完成任务。
    今年在学习与推广苏长有、谢万福、杨德重等先进经验的基础上，全省出现了各工种先进小组八百七十七个。这些小组使用比较先进的工具，采用比较先进的操作方法，改进了劳动组织，大大提高了劳动效率，缩短了工期，使全省能够顺利地完成全年计划。在这些先进小组与先进单位中，出现了一些突出的典型，创造了一些突出的经验。
    在砌砖方面：长春市建筑公司张春华先进瓦工小组在学习苏长有新砌砖法的基础上，又学习苏联马克西漫科的“连续施工法”，创造了“双手挤浆连续循环砌砖法”。这种砌砖法，在表演时每人每日工作八小时可砌砖八千一百块，实际操作平均每日二千八百块，比分段砌砖法提高效率一倍。全小组六十天就完成一百八十万块砖的建筑任务，节省了七百七十八个人工。在吉林市，东北人民政府工业部轻工业管理局机电水暖工程队王锡林先进瓦工小组在学习苏长有经验的基础上，把铺灰器改造为“喷水式压浆器”，两道工序合为一道，减轻了笨重劳动，提高了效率，使每人每日砌砖效率平均达到二千八百块，超过原定额百分之五十，比旧砌砖法提高效率百分之二百五十四。
    在抹灰方面：长春市建筑公司刘景山先进抹灰小组学习了郭瓦廖夫工作法和杨德重抹灰流水作业法，全组按技术程度科学分工，明确操作责任，并创造与改进了十三种工具，使劳动效率大大提高。过去一、二等技工每人每日可抹灰十五至十六平方公尺，现在一个普通工就能抹灰五十五平方公尺，并保证了质量。全组六十天完成了三万平方公尺的抹灰任务，节省了一千多个工。
    在勾缝方面：长春市工业局建设公司倪永春小组创造了双齿勾缝工具，工作效率提高百分之一七四。过去勾缝一般技工每日只勾三十至四十公尺，现在徒工每天也已能勾六十五公尺以上，并保证了质量。
    在木工方面：东北人民政府工业部第三工程处王朝选先进木工小组，学习了谢万福木工流水作业法，又创造了十一种工具，工作效率提高一倍以上。
    在混凝土作业方面：东北人民政府工业部第二十一工程公司在苏联专家康士坦丁诺夫同志的帮助与指导之下，实行了混凝土真空作业法，为混凝土作业开辟了一条新的道路。
    在施工方法方面：有六个单位实行了平行流水作业法。吉林省工程公司修建的四千平方公尺二层楼工人宿舍，原计划施工日期为七十天，采用平行流水作业法后，三十天就完成了，节省了大量人工，节省了五亿六千三百九十八万元的财富。
    在设计方面：长春市建筑公司设计科第三组实行了“设计流水作业法”，比单人设计提高效率百分之九十八。实行设计流水作业法的好处，是工作集中，能发挥技术人员的能力，业务专一，责任明确，工作容易熟悉和提高，也能互相督促检查，加强整体观念。
    这些先进经验是十分宝贵的，在国家基本建设事业上如能得到普遍推广，将大大提高工作效率，加快国家工业化的速度。
    目前我们在基本建设工作中存在着不少困难和矛盾，其主要矛盾还是任务十分重大，而主观力量则十分薄弱。无论地质勘探的力量，设计的力量和施工的力量，都远不能满足大规模经济建设的需要。这些困难差不多都集中到一点上，就是我们的技术力量既感不足，又比较落后。
    过去，基本建设的生产方法是比较落后的。劳动组织带有手工业的性质，互相间的联系不够密切，一个工人要完成差不多一件工作的整个工序。这样就难于发挥集体劳动作用，难于提高技术水平。在生产工具上，有许多还带有原始性质，差不多相传了几千年。生产工具的落后，大大阻碍劳动效率的提高。在操作方法上相沿成习，有许多工人还沿用着相传很久的旧操作方法，阻碍生产力的提高。这种情况，在过去基本建设任务较小时还可以勉强维持下去，但是今天的情况根本改变了，旧的技术水平已经不能满足今天的需要了。解决这个问题的办法，就是大力推广先进经验，改进劳动组织，改进生产工具，改进操作方法。这些改革集中起来，就是整个基本建设生产方法上的改革。
    但是，根据吉林省目前的情况来看，先进经验在基本建设部门中推广得还不够广泛、不够深入、不够平衡。采用先进经验操作的小组，只占现场施工小组总数的百分之四五点一。其中先进砌砖小组占砌砖小组总数的百分之四四点七；抹灰先进小组占抹灰小组总数的百分之五七点八；木工先进小组占木工小组总数的百分之四二点一；其他在混凝土、挖土、勾缝、砌石、水道暖汽、电气、机械安装等方面先进小组占小组总数的比例也都不超过上面的平均百分比。这种情况说明有相当数量的小组差不多还停留在落后的技术水平上。在推广先进经验的深度上，有些单位推广得较好，工人对学习先进经验极感兴趣，由于采用先进经验，提高了劳动效率，增加了收入，使个人利益与国家利益更加一致起来。如张春华先进瓦工小组，技工平均每天得一八点九分，中等工（按四级工计）得一四点七三分，新徒工得八点二六分。刘景山先进抹灰小组定额是十五公尺，二级工人工资十七分，四级工人十三分，徒工八分，但他们的二级工人却是实得四一点二○分，四级工实得三一点五九分，徒工实得一九点四八分。另外，有些单位先进经验推广得不够深入，还没有在工人中扎根；有些是虎头蛇尾，半途而废；有些地方仍存在着比较严重的形式主义，为装饰门面而推广先进经验；有些单位学习制造了一些新工具，但是摆着不用，实际操作时仍然使用旧工具，沿用旧方法。
    在领导方面，对推广先进经验还有若干自流放任现象，计划性组织性还不足。有的单位对推广先进经验的重大意义认识不足，认为：“推广先进经验能够完成任务，不推广先进经验也能完成任务。”
    “采用先进经验也可以，不采用先进经验也可以。”由于领导上采取了不够认真的态度，就使某些单位推广先进经验的运动陷于自发的、无组织、无领导的状态。
    为了进一步普遍推广先进经验，迎接明年大规模的基本建设任务，我们必须克服今年推广先进经验运动中的缺点，首先必须克服领导上的若干缺点。
    今年冬季整训是基本建设的大练兵，如何在整训中加强政治教育，提高职工的政治水平和思想水平，如何正确地总结今年的先进经验，并普遍推广各工种中具有决定意义的突出经验，以提高固定工人的技术水平，是一件十分重要的工作。
    吉林省总工会已于十一月中旬召开了全省基本建设先进生产者代表会议，初步总结了今年基本建设的先进经验，充分交换了意见，作了典型介绍，对各先进小组和先进生产者进行了表扬奖励。这对进一步推广先进经验有很大推动作用。为了在全省范围内交流各地经验，省总工会又组织了各个突出的小组的代表，在整训期间到各工程单位向同工种职工作典型介绍。这也是比较有效的办法。
