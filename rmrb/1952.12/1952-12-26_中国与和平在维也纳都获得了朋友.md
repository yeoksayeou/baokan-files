    China and Peace Have Both Gained Friends in Vienna
    Pierre Cot, French Representative to the World Peace Congress of the Peoples
    We have many reasons to celebrate the achievements of the World Peace Congress of the Peoples. One of these is that the congress enabled representatives from Western countries to meet our Chinese friends, allowing them to better understand and appreciate the attitudes of our Chinese friends, and thereby express a deeper level of admiration for them.
    We were pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Soong Ching Ling, who sat on the stage, whose great name is of great significance to all democrats in the world. Mr. Guo Moruo's outstanding speech deeply moved us. After listening to his report, a French representative said to me: "I didn't really understand China's attitude towards the prisoner-of-war issue before. But now, you see, I understand everything; I know that China's attitude is completely correct." I want to quote this little thing not only to express my admiration for Guo Moruo, but also because it is a representative event during the Vienna meeting.
    For a week, men and women from all corners of the world, representing different views, and with extremely different ideas, lived together. They took this opportunity to exchange their thoughts and compare their points of view. Because they know each other more, they will understand each other more clearly in the future. The World Peace Congress of the Peoples is indeed a great gathering of mankind.
    China has gained many friends in Vienna; peace has also gained many friends. This once again shows that the cause of the People's Republic of China is inseparable from the cause of peace.
    I would like to express my heartfelt admiration and longing to the great Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong. The Chinese people give us valuable lessons of heroism, nobility, and wisdom every day.

    中国与和平在维也纳都获得了朋友
    法国出席世界人民和平大会代表　皮尔·戈特
    我们有很多的理由庆贺世界人民和平大会的成就。其中一个理由就是大会使西方国家的代表们会见了我们的中国朋友，使他们更好地认识和体会到中国朋友们的态度，并从而对中国朋友们表示更深一层的钦佩。
    我们曾以愉快的心情向坐在台上的宋庆龄先生致敬，她这个伟大的名字对世界一切民主人士来说是具有很大的意义的。郭沫若先生的卓越讲演，使我们深深地感动。一位法国代表听了他的报告后，对我说：“以前我的确不很了解中国对于战俘问题的态度。而现在呢，你看，我全都明白了；我知道了中国的态度是完全正确的。”我之所以要引述这件小事情，不仅是为了借此表示我对郭沫若的钦佩，而且也是因为它是维也纳开会期间具有代表性的事件。
    在一个星期的时间内，来自世界各个角落的、代表不同见解的、而且思想极为不同的男人和女人共同生活在一起。他们乘这个机会交流了他们的思想和比较了他们的观点。由于他们互相认识得多了，所以今后他们也将互相了解得更清楚。世界人民和平大会的确是人类的一次伟大的聚会。
    中国在维也纳得到了许多朋友；和平也得到了许多朋友。这又一次表明：中华人民共和国的事业是与和平的事业分不开的。
    我谨向伟大的中国人民和毛泽东主席表示我衷心的钦佩和向往。中国人民每天都给我们以英勇、崇高和明智的宝贵教训。
