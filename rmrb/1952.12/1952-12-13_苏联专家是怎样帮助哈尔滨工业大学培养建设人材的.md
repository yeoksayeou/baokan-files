How Soviet Experts Helped Harbin Institute of Technology Train Construction Talents
Harbin Institute of Technology President Chen Kangbai

Harbin Institute of Technology was founded in 1920 and possessed all the shortcomings of an old-style university. For example, insufficient class hours for basic courses; lack of a series of specialized courses; lack of organic connection between basic courses and specialized courses; too much theoretical instruction and too little practical operation; no systematic production practice; low quality of course design and graduation thesis design, etc. This was precisely the manifestation of the separation of theory from practice. As a result, the graduates produced were actually difficult to qualify as engineers. Therefore, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union became extremely necessary.

In the spring of 1951, the first group of Soviet advisors, headed by Chief Advisor F.V. Gulin, came here to help us carry out many reforms in teaching. For example, based on the advanced experience of Soviet higher industrial schools, and with reference to China's objective situation and equipment conditions, five-year teaching plans, semester teaching plans, teaching outlines and teaching calendars for major courses, and postgraduate training plans were formulated for each specialized group. On this basis, the school held the first Scientific and Technological Teaching Research Work Conference in July 1951, summarizing the work of this stage. At that time, the advisory group put forward various constructive suggestions at the conference for further work. For example, in order to ensure that students are taught well, they pointed out that all teachers must improve their theoretical level and study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. In terms of teaching research, they suggested that the Academic Affairs Committee should listen to reports on lectures, experiments, internships, course design and graduation thesis design, and stipulate the guiding methods for these activities. Teaching and research sections should study the methods of course lecturing and experimental guidance, and carry out the work of compiling teaching outlines, so that their content approaches the teaching level of Soviet higher education institutions; and mobilize postgraduates to translate Soviet textbooks and review textbooks and lecture notes published by the school in the past, etc. In terms of scientific research, they pointed out that research topics should be combined with the needs of the national economy; each teaching and research section should establish close ties with enterprise departments; all teachers should carry out scientific research work, and at the same time strengthen the work of student research groups; and suggested that the school apply to the central Ministry of Education for approval to establish a scientific research department in the school, etc. These suggestions played a decisive role in the development of the school's work in 1952, promoted the fundamental changes in our school's teaching plan and course content, and transformed the school into a regular industrial university.

In the spring of 1952, the second group of Soviet advisors, headed by Chief Advisor A.V. Krylov, came to our school. Subsequently, various major reform works were launched, such as: (1) Establishment of teaching and research sections (basic teaching organization). The content of the work of the teaching and research sections was clearly defined, thus determining the workload of each teacher, formulating a full-time salary system for teachers, adjusting the organization of the teaching and research sections, strengthening the preparatory work of teaching organizations, such as compiling outlines and lecture notes, adding wall charts and models, establishing new laboratories and research rooms, etc.; and all teaching staff were organized to form thirty-six teaching and research sections. This promoted teaching research work and generally improved teaching quality and student learning achievements. (2) Cultivating new types of teachers. The advisory group not only actively helped us lay the foundation for the teaching and research sections, but also concentrated their main energy on the training of postgraduates, and cultivated a group of new backbones for us who can run schools independently. (3) Strengthening production practice work. The advisory group attached particular importance to production practice work in combination with reality. Before formulating the production practice plan, they went to factories and mines to study the situation, and then formulated the plan and compiled the outline. In the internship outline, there are clear and detailed regulations on the purpose, task, location, time, and content of the internship. At the same time, through production practice, course design, and graduation thesis design, they put forward rationalization proposals to factories and mines, and assisted industrial production departments in solving certain technical problems on site. (4) Overcoming difficulties in teaching equipment. In order to overcome the difficulties in teaching equipment, the advisory group took all possible measures to establish new laboratories such as metal cutting, welding, precision measurement, electrical engineering principles, electromagnetic measurement, high-voltage electrical engineering, chemical engineering principles, liquid fuel, organic synthesis, mine surveying, mining machinery, and hydraulics using existing equipment; and renovated and expanded laboratories such as foundry, heat treatment processing, theoretical mechanics, general chemistry, general physics, electrical machinery, and industrial analysis on the basis of the original ones. This ensured the completion of the teaching plan, and made it possible for us to transfer six complete laboratories to Northeast Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, Harbin Railway Institute, and Northeast Institute of Geology in this summer's departmental adjustment. (5) Starting scientific research work. Due to the lack of equipment, books, and cadres, the progress of scientific research work was considerably limited. However, with the active promotion of the advisory group, we began research on high-speed cutting, hard alloy coating, spark cutting, and special steel, carried out the prevention of silicosis in mines, applied high-speed welding methods, and manufactured welding drugs and welding rods; and established certain production links with production departments, solving some technical problems for them. At the same time, the Scientific Research Department was established. The advisory group particularly emphasized that teachers should do scientific research work. They believed that carrying out scientific research is the only way to improve teaching quality. (6) Translation of new textbooks and writing of new books. The advisory group also put a lot of effort into introducing teaching materials and textbooks. In the past two years, our school has printed 47 new textbooks, written 7 new books, and translated various teaching materials (a total of 1.55 million words); 24 new textbooks are being translated, written, and proofread, with a total of approximately 8 million words. On the basis of the above, we held the second Scientific and Technological Teaching Research Work Conference in June 1952, summarizing the work of learning from Soviet experience in the past two years.

This autumn, the third batch of eighteen Soviet advisors came to our school again. After this, our school opened various professional groups and improved the teaching quality more quickly, making the school closer to the level required by the Soviet industrial university departments.

From every comrade in the Soviet advisory group, we have seen the spirit of internationalism and their down-to-earth scientific attitude and humble educator demeanor.

Every comrade in the advisory group particularly respects the inventions and creations of our working people. They wrote these inventions and creations into the textbooks to inspire students' love for the motherland. For example, Chief Advisor F.V. Gulin mentioned the fact that China used milling methods to manufacture parts of the armillary sphere in 1668 when he gave his first lecture on cutting principles. When he taught high-speed cutting, he always mentioned China's new record in high-speed cutting today. Advisor B.B. Shakolov specifically raised the issue of China's invention of the compass in his speech at the school's first Scientific and Technological Teaching Research Work Conference. He suggested that the school clarify the historical materials related to this issue in order to smash the fallacies used by European and American bourgeois scholars to obliterate the historical facts of China's invention of the magnetic needle. Chief Advisor A.V. Krylov attached particular importance to China's inventions in theoretical mechanics. He paid close attention to the outstanding creations of ancient Chinese mechanicians Gongshuban, Mozi, and Zhang Heng, and sent his postgraduates to the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to collect relevant historical materials, and included a chapter on "Achievements of Chinese Scientists in Mechanics" in the theoretical mechanics course outline.

The comrades of the advisory group also pay attention to conducting political education for students in their daily work. For example, when designing graduation theses, students felt that it was difficult to translate scientific terms and it was more convenient to write in Russian. The advisory group said: Do you have to use Russian when you go out to work? You must develop the habit of writing in the language of the motherland. They not only said this, but also carefully learned the Chinese pronunciation of each technical term. For example, in the past, our school used Russian for graduation thesis defenses, but the advisory group firmly advocated speaking in Chinese. They understood and asked questions through translation. For example, when the comrades of the advisory group checked students' notes and saw English words, they often asked students to explain them to him in Chinese. When he heard the Chinese characters, he said very happily: "How nice Chinese sounds! You should use the language of the motherland in the future!" In this way, they made the students feel that all aspects of the motherland are lovable.

Every comrade in the advisory group attaches great importance to the ideological education of students. They criticized the idealistic views of Pauling's "resonance theory" in the theory of organic compound structure and the "uncertainty principle" in physics, as well as the selfish views of bourgeois scholars on "power factor," etc. And with the theme of "Criticizing 'Resonance Theory,'" teachers were organized to conduct discussions at the school's second Scientific and Technological Teaching Research Work Conference. The advisory group not only educated students in this way in terms of academic lectures, but also guided students to respect the interests of the working people at any time in their daily lives in order to cultivate students' qualities of serving the people. For example, when Advisor G.K. Gonchulinko heard students talk about personal interests, he said: "Obeying the needs of the people is our interest." For example, when Chief Advisor A.V. Krylov talked about the interest in studying pure science with students, he said that it is necessary to clarify the problem of researching for whom, such as "What is the use of studying how many spots there are on the back of a fly?" Advisor Ya. L. Lujing used concrete facts to illustrate the principled differences between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in teaching methods and teaching content, as well as the superiority of the new teaching method. In his report on "Scientific Research Work in Higher Education Institutions," Advisor B.B. Shakolov focused on proposing that various forms of research work in higher education institutions should be linked to the teaching process. The advisory group criticized Professor Shavien of our school for his research report on solving Laplace's equation with variable functions at the school's first Scientific and Technological Teaching Research Work Conference, believing that it was divorced from reality; praised postgraduate Wang Guangyuan for his research report on "A Simple Method for Solving Steel Frames by Deformation Method" at the second Scientific and Technological Teaching Research Work Conference, because it was related to reality.

Soviet advisors have the demeanor of educators. Their attitude is extremely humble and their work is meticulous. They patiently teach us how to run a new type of industrial university. Take the work of the teaching and research section as an example. The comrades of the advisory group always patiently teach us how to carry out the work. As soon as the teaching and research section was established, they would find the members of the teaching and research section for collective talks, explain the scope of work of the research section in detail, and use examples to illustrate how the work of each part should be linked together. In addition, according to the school calendar, the specific content and schedule of teaching inspections, tests, examinations, etc. were stipulated, and the system of teachers taking turns to be on duty was stipulated; detailed regulations were also made on the learning methods and methods of postgraduates, so that everyone initially understood the direction and overall picture of the work of the teaching and research section. Then, according to the specific conditions of the school, the entire teaching outline and teaching calendar for students and postgraduates were formulated, and the implementation steps of the teaching plan were clearly stipulated. In addition to teaching classes, the comrades of the advisory group spent most of their time leading the work of the teaching and research section. For example, they often talked with the directors of the teaching and research sections, made suggestions, and inspected and urged the work. They also specifically arranged how to open the teaching and research section meeting, personally drafted the agenda of the meeting, formulated a system of division of labor and cooperation, and designated special personnel to be responsible for each specific task. At first, we didn't know how to work, and they taught everyone how to design in a very specific and detailed way. If anyone had questions about teaching methods, they would explain them and give demonstrations. For example, when teaching exercise classes, they would first explain how to teach, and then demonstrate to everyone. After the class, they would discuss with everyone; they not only answered various questions, but also asked everyone to give them opinions. For example, when postgraduates conducted experimental teaching, the advisor comrades always listened to the class in person. They taught postgraduates how to speak, how to prepare, how to write on the blackboard, and how to design and write on the blackboard before class. They also personally guided the preparation of classroom experiments. Before the examination, they clarified the requirements of the examination to the members of the teaching and research section and gave demonstrations, so that everyone clearly understood the specific content of the examination. They also provided specific assistance in the translation of textbooks. For example, they personally checked the translated manuscripts. After the various tasks of the teaching and research section were on the right track, they brought everyone together to summarize. In this way, they nurtured the young buds of this basic teaching organization to the stage of growth. They worked tirelessly throughout the year, and some comrades even fell ill due to overwork.

In the process of learning from Soviet experience in the past two years, we have deeply realized that: first, the policy of specialization in higher education institutions must be adhered to and implemented without any hesitation. Multi-disciplinary schools are impractical. It is an outdated organizational form. We can only train construction talents quickly and effectively by running more specialized colleges. Second, in order to truly combine theory with practice and ensure the quality of teaching, we must start from formulating teaching plans, determining the content of teaching materials, and doing a good job in production practice and course design. This is something that cannot be sloppy at all. Take the plan as an example. We must never use the method of opening a Chinese medicine shop. Teaching materials must be closely integrated with production, especially in specialized courses, course design, and graduation thesis design. This must be strictly required and cannot be discounted in the slightest; at the same time, attention should be paid to the students' level of acceptance. Third, cultivating postgraduates and organizing teachers to carry out scientific research work is the key to improving teaching quality. The comrades of the advisory group told us: The key to maintaining a certain quality of teachers and continuously improving their level lies in doing a good job in postgraduate training. Fourth, in cultivating new types of engineers, we must pay attention to cultivating their new virtues.

In the past two years, with the help of the Soviet advisory group, Harbin Institute of Technology has had the foundation of a new type of industrial university. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work. We will continue to improve our work so that the school reaches the level of Soviet industrial universities and trains a large number of construction talents for the country.

    苏联专家是怎样帮助哈尔滨工业大学培养建设人材的
    哈尔滨工业大学校长  陈康白
    哈尔滨工业大学是在一九二○年开办的，它具有旧型大学的一切缺点。例如，基础课程的时数不够；缺乏一系列的专门课程；基础课程和专门课程缺乏有机的联系；理论课多，实际操作少；没有系统的生产实习；课程设计和毕业论文设计的质量低，等等。这正是理论和实际相脱节的表现。这样，培养出来的毕业生，实际上很难担任工程师。因此，学习苏联的先进经验就成为非常必要。
    一九五一年春季以弗·瓦·古林总顾问为首的第一批苏联顾问来到这里，帮助我们在教学方面进行了许多改革工作。例如，根据苏联高等工业学校的先进经验，并参照我国客观情况和设备条件制定了每一专门组的五年教学计划、学期教学计划、主要课程的教学提纲和教学日历、研究生的培养计划。就在这个基础上，学校在一九五一年七月召开了第一届科学技术教学研究工作会议，总结了这一阶段的工作。当时顾问组在大会上提出了进一步开展工作的各种建设性建议。例如，在保证教好学生方面，他们指出所有教师必须提高理论水平，学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作。在教学研究方面，他们建议教务会议应听取有关讲课、实验、实习、课程设计和毕业论文设计的报告，并规定对这些活动的指导方式。教研室应研究课程讲授和实验指导的方法，进行教学提纲的编制工作，使其内容接近苏联高等学校的教学水平；并发动研究生翻译苏联教科书，审查本校过去出版的教科书和讲义等等。在科学研究方面，他们指出研究题应该和国民经济的要求相结合；各教研室应同企业部门取得密切联系；全体教师应作科学研究工作，同时要加强学生研究小组工作；并建议校方呈请中央教育部批准本校设立科学研究部等等。这些建议对于学校一九五二年度工作的开展，起了决定性的作用，促成了我校教学计划和课程内容的基本改变，使学校转为正规的工业大学。
    一九五二年春季以阿·瓦·克雷洛夫总顾问为首的第二批苏联顾问来到本校。随即展开了各种主要改革工作，例如：（一）建立了教学研究室（教学基本组织）。明确规定了教学研究室的工作内容，从而确定了每一教师的工作量，制定了教师专任工薪制，调整了教研室的组织，加强了教学组织的准备工作，如编写提纲、讲义，添制挂图、模型，成立新的实验室和研究室等等；并把一切教学人员组织起来，成立了三十六个教学研究室。这就推动了教学研究工作，普遍提高了教学质量和学生学习的成绩。（二）培养新型师资。顾问组不仅积极帮助我们打下了教学研究室的基础，而且把他们的主要精力集中在研究生的培养上，为我们培养了一批能独立办学的新骨干。（三）加强生产实习工作。顾问组特别重视结合实际的生产实习工作。他们在制定生产实习计划以前，先到工厂矿山去研究情况，然后拟定计划，编写提纲。在实习提纲中，对于实习的目的、任务、地点、时间、内容等方面，都有明确的详尽的规定。同时通过生产实习、课程设计、毕业论文设计等工作，他们向工厂矿山提了合理化建议，并协助工业生产部门解决了现场的某些技术问题。（四）克服教学设备方面的困难。为了克服教学设备方面的困难，顾问组采取了一切可能的办法，利用旧有器材建立了金属切削、焊接、精密测量、电工原理、电磁测量、高压电工程、化工原理、液体燃料、有机合成、矿山测量、矿山机械、水力学等新型实验室；在旧有的基础上改装和扩大了铸工、热处理加工、理论力学、普通化学、普通物理、电机、工业分析等实验室。这就保证了教学计划的完成，并使我们在今年暑期的院系调整中有可能将六所完整的实验室转移给东北工学院、大连工学院、哈尔滨铁道学院和东北地质学院。（五）开始了科学研究工作。由于设备、图书和干部的缺乏，科学研究工作的进行曾受到相当大的限制。但在顾问组的积极推动之下，我们开始了高速切削、硬质合金涂镀、火花切削、特殊钢的研究，进行了矿山矽尘病的预防工作、应用了高速焊接法、制造了焊药焊条；并和生产部门建立了一定的生产联系，为它们解决了某些技术上的问题。同时也成立了科学研究部。顾问组特别强调，教师要做科学研究工作。他们认为进行科学研究是提高教学质量的唯一方法。（六）新教材的翻译和新书的著作。在介绍教材和教科书方面，顾问组同样用了很大的力量。两年来我校印行了四十七种新教科书，著作了七种新书，先后翻译了各种教材（共一百五十五万字）；二十四种新教科书正在译述、校订中，字数共约八百万字。在上述基础上，我们又在一九五二年六月召开了第
    二届科学技术教学研究工作会议，总结了两年来学习苏联经验的工作。
    今年秋季第三批十八位苏联顾问又来到我校。这以后，我校开办了各种专业组，并更快地提高了教学质量，使学校更接近苏联工业大学系组所要求的水准。
    从苏联顾问组的每一个同志身上，我们看到了国际主义精神和他们的踏实的科学态度与谦虚的教育家风度。
    顾问组的每一个同志特别尊重我国劳动人民的创造发明。他们把这些创造发明写到教材里面，去启发学生对祖国的热爱。例如弗·瓦·古林总顾问在他上第一堂切削原理课的时候，就提到我国在一六六八年曾用铣削的办法来制造浑天仪一部分零件的事实。当他教到高速切削的时候，他总是提到我国今天高速切削的新纪录。贝·勃·沙阔洛夫顾问在学校第一届科学技术教学研究工作会议上的发言中特别提出我国发明指南针的问题。他建议校方把有关这一问题的史料弄清楚，以粉碎欧美资产阶级学者们用以抹杀中国发明磁针史实的谬论。阿·瓦·克雷洛夫总顾问特别重视我国在理论力学上的发明。他很注意我国古代力学家公输班、墨子、张衡等人的卓越创造，并派他的研究生去中国科学院历史研究所搜集有关的史料，在理论力学课程提纲中列入
    “中国科学家在力学上的成就”一章。
    顾问组的同志并注意在日常工作中对同学进行政治教育。例如在设计毕业论文时，学生感到科学名词翻译困难，不如用俄文写方便。顾问组说：难道你们出去工作时非用俄文不成？必须养成用祖国语言写作的习惯。他们不仅这样讲，而且认真地学习每个技术名词的中文发音。又如毕业论文答辩，我校以往都是用俄文，顾问组坚决主张用中文讲，他们通过翻译来进行了解并提出问题。又如顾问组的同志在检查学生笔记看到英文字的时候，往往要求同学用中文讲解给他听。当他听到中文字以后，非常愉快地说：“中文多么好听啊！你们以后要运用祖国文字！”就这样，他们使学生感到祖国的各方面都是可爱的。
    顾问组的每一个同志对同学的思想教育都是很重视的。他们对鲍林在有机化合物结构理论上的“共振论”和物理学中“测不准原理”等唯心论的观点，以及资产阶级学者在“功率因数”上所表现的因私害公观点等等，都进行了批判。并以“批判‘共振论’”为题，在本校第二届科学技术教学研究工作会议上组织教师们进行了讨论。顾问组不仅在学理讲授方面这样教育学生，即在日常生活中也随时诱导学生尊重劳动人民利益，以培养学生为人民服务的品质。例如哥·康·龚却林可顾问听到学生谈个人兴趣时，他就说：“服从人民需要就是我们的兴趣。”又如阿·瓦·克雷洛夫总顾问在学生谈到关于研究纯粹科学的兴趣时，他说必须弄清为谁研究的问题，例如“研究苍蝇背上有几个斑点，有什么用呢？”雅·拉·鲁静顾问用具体的事实来说明无产阶级和资产阶级在教学方法、教学内容上的原则区别以及新教学法的优越性。贝·勃·沙阔洛夫顾问在他所作“高等学校科学研究工作”报告中，着重提出高等学校各种形式的研究工作应和教学过程联系起来。顾问组在学校第一届科学技术教学研究工作会议中批评了本校沙维恩教授用变函数解拉氏方程式的研究报告，他认为那是脱离现实的；表扬了研究生王光远在第二届科学技术教学研究工作会议上所做“以变形法解钢架的简捷方法”的研究报告，因为那是联系实际的。
    苏联顾问具有教育家的风度。他们的态度极为谦逊，工作细致。他们耐心地教我们怎样办新型工业大学。就拿教研室的工作来说吧，顾问组同志总是那样细心地教我们怎样进行工作。教研室刚刚成立，他们就找教研室的成员进行集体谈话，详细说明研究室的工作范围，并用实例说明各部分工作应如何联系起来。又按照校历，规定了教学检查、测验、考试等等的具体内容和日程，并规定了教师轮班值日等制度；对研究生的学习方式和方法，也作了详尽的规定，使大家初步了解了教研室工作的方向和全貌。然后根据学校的具体条件，制定学生和研究生的全部教学提纲和教学日历，明确规定了教学计划的实施步骤。顾问组的同志除上课以外，把大部分时间放在对教研室工作的领导上。例如他们经常找教研室主任进行谈话，提出建议，并对工作进行检查、督促。又具体布置如何开教研室会议，亲自拟定会议的议程，订出分工合作的制度，指定专人担负每项具体工作。我们最初不懂得如何工作，他们就很具体、详细地教大家设计。如果有人对教学方法发生疑问，他们就给讲解，并进行示范。例如上习题课时，他们先说明如何上法，然后示范给大家看。上完以后再同大家一齐讨论；他们不但回答各种问题，而且要求大家对他们提出意见。再如研究生进行试验教学时，顾问同志总是亲自在一旁听课。他们教研究生怎样讲，怎样准备，怎样写黑板，怎样在上课前设计写黑板。他们还亲自指导课堂试验的准备工作。进行考试前，他们向教研室成员阐明考试的要求，并进行示范，使大家明确了解考试的具体内容。在翻译教科书方面，他们也进行了具体帮助，例如，他们亲自检查译稿。教研室的各种工作走上正轨以后，他们就把大家找来，进行总结。他们就这样把这个教学基本组织的幼芽培养到成长的阶段。他们终年不倦地工作着，个别同志甚至因而积劳成疾。
    两年来在学习苏联经验的过程中，我们深刻认识到：第一，高等学校专业化的方针必须坚持贯彻，不能有任何犹豫。多科性学校是不实际的。它是一种过时的组织形式。我们只有多办专门学院，才能迅速而有效地培养建设人材。第二，要真正做到结合实际、保证教学的质量，必须从制订教学计划、确定教材内容、做好生产实习和课程设计等方面着手，这是一点也不能马虎的。就拿计划来说吧，决不能用开中药铺的办法。教材要密切结合生产，特别在专门课、课程设计和毕业论文设计方面，必须严格要求做到这一点，丝毫不能打折扣；同时要注意学生的接受程度。第三，培养研究生、组织教师进行科学研究工作，是提高教学质量的关键。顾问组同志告诉我们：使教员保持一定的质量并使其水平不断提高的关键，在于做好研究生的培养工作。第四，在培养新型工程师方面，必须注意培养他们的新德性。
    两年来哈尔滨工业大学在苏联顾问组的帮助下，已经具有了新型工业大学的基础。但我们的工作仍有不少缺点，我们将不断改进工作，使学校达到苏联工业大学的水准，为国家培养大批的建设人材。
