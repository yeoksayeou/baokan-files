Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 18th. The film festival of the World People's Peace Congress opened at 10:30 pm on the 14th at the Taborkino Theater here, with the screening of "Long Live Peace," a documentary produced by the Beijing Film Studio about the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The theater had an audience of over two thousand people, including delegates from various countries attending the World People's Peace Congress, who, despite attending intense meetings during the day, still participated enthusiastically in the film festival.

Joris Ivens, the renowned Dutch film director who has won several film peace prizes, represented the congress in announcing the start of the film festival and gave a brief introduction to "Long Live Peace."

Moving scenes appeared continuously before the audience: the universal support of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions for the convening of the conference, many people opposing police persecution, the arrival of the delegates, and the warm welcome given to the delegates by the people of Beijing. The applause on the screen resonated with the applause of the delegates sitting in the Vienna theater. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference depicted in the film fully demonstrated the unity and friendship of the people of various countries and the triumph of the spirit of consultation over the use of force. When the moving scenes appeared on the screen of the Indian and Pakistani delegations signing a joint statement on the Kashmir issue, the white-haired leaders of the two delegations embracing each other, and the American delegation presenting gifts to the Korean and Japanese delegations, the delegates who had participated in the Peace Conference and were now in Vienna applauded, because these scenes reminded them of the historically significant days in Beijing two months ago. They applauded and cheered to their hearts' content. When the conference unanimously passed eleven resolutions at the end, the delegates on the screen stood up and applauded in unison, and the audience also applauded, with a storm of applause shaking the hall. The final scene on the screen showed a mass rally of 50,000 people celebrating the success of the Peace Conference in the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the moving scenes of delegates in various costumes embracing the people attending the rally, who were waving flower branches, holding models of peace doves, and shouting "Peace." When the delegations from various countries presented gifts to the Chinese delegation, and the screen showed them presenting an embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao, a long and thunderous applause rang out in the hall.

This film demonstrated the strong will of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions to demand peace, unity, and friendship, and it gave the delegates attending the Vienna Congress an unforgettable impression.
