    Learning from the Design Philosophy of Soviet Experts
    Bai Tianming
    The Northeast's newly built Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4 has already commenced construction. Some of the projects have been completed and have begun production, with the entire project expected to be completed in four years.
    The design of such a massive factory is extraordinarily complex. The correct design it is now based on was completed after four major revisions, costing nearly two years. These two years were a tortuous and arduous process of ideological struggle, which fully demonstrated the harmfulness of erroneous design thinking and the backwardness of capitalist design technology. At the same time, it fully demonstrated the superiority of Soviet socialist design thinking.
    In January 1950, the First National Electrical Work Conference decided that, in order to meet the needs of the country's increasingly developing economic construction, a new-style electrical machinery factory should be built in the Northeast, and the Electrical Industry Administration Bureau of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department was tasked with the design. At that time, a group of technical personnel from the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau, because they had studied and worked in the United States for a long time in the past, and had only participated in the construction of the new China for a short period, still had relatively strong capitalist technical viewpoints in their thinking. Therefore, when they accepted this design task, they followed the capitalist technical viewpoints and methods, and completely adopted all the materials of a motor factory designed for the puppet "Resources Committee" by the American Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company in the past. Their initial design was for a comprehensive motor factory with a wide variety of products, but the most important product—large-scale power generation equipment—still could not be manufactured in large quantities. The consequence would inevitably be that the factory would have congenital deficiencies and would still not be free from the economic nature of a colony. This ran counter to the guiding principle of heavy industry construction in the New China. In the second half of 1951, after consulting several Soviet experts, they gradually discovered many serious errors in the original design. Under the guidance of the experts, these errors were corrected one by one, making the factory's design correct and reasonable, and basically adapted to the needs of the industrialization of People's China. The greatest contribution of the Soviet experts in guiding the entire design was that they transformed the factory from a comprehensive factory that could not reasonably produce major products into a factory with independent production performance that could centrally manufacture large-scale power generation equipment. At the same time, they provided us with advanced quotas, increasing the factory's production capacity by 80 percent compared to the original design. During these two years, our designers gained rich experience and lessons, and received many valuable benefits from the Soviet experts.
    The design experience and lessons of the factory tell us that we must study and establish firm advanced design thinking in order to ensure that we can make correct and reasonable designs.
    The design of a new factory must first be regarded as a part of the country's entire planned economy, and its products, scale, and location must be determined from the development of the entire national economy. At the same time, it must also take into account the coordination with other economies and the coordination with urban construction plans in order to meet the needs of national economic development. In the initial design of the factory, this principle was not grasped. Instead, the factory was considered in isolation. When formulating the plans for some large products, instead of deeply understanding the current and future economic construction development situation and plans and determining the specifications and quantities of products based on its requirements for power equipment, they first determined the machine tool equipment and then determined the specifications and quantities of products based on their production capacity and performance. The designers believed that the production task could only be a hypothetical one, with one set of plans for design and another set for formal production. Obviously, the result of such a design would be to separate the factory from the national economic plan. When determining the types of products, the designers designed the factory as a comprehensive motor factory, intending to manufacture all major electrical products such as large and small water and thermal power generation equipment, large and small motors, various transformers, switching equipment, and insulation materials. The manufacturing ratio of small motors was designed to be quite large. Conversely, the manufacturing ratio of large-scale power generation equipment and motors was designed to be very small, and the two were extremely mismatched. When the Soviet experts reviewed the design, they first criticized this point. The experts believed that:
    "The purpose of manufacturing generators is to supply power for industrial production. If we manufacture a 1,000-kilowatt generator, we must manufacture a total of 2,500 kilowatts of medium and small motor equipment to turn the electricity it generates into power and apply it to industrial production. Using this principle to measure the design, we find that it produces more small motors and the production ratio of large-scale power generation equipment is small. This is obviously not suitable for the current economic construction needs of the New China. At the same time, a factory that manufactures such a wide variety of products will inevitably be large in scale, small in output, and small in the capacity of each product. This is absolutely not in line with the principles of scientific management." Under the guidance of the experts, the output ratio of large, medium, and small motors was correctly determined, and the types of products were simplified to only producing one type of generator and a portion of motors and insulation materials to meet the needs of power development. At the same time, the experts also pointed out another shortcoming of the original design: it did not consider the coordination between raw material supply and product sales. For example, the raw materials needed for bakelite powder, one of the insulation materials, had to be transported from a region more than 1,000 miles away, while factories that needed a large amount of this product were still within the raw material production area. The experts said: "Such transportation back and forth causes great waste to the country. Why not set up a workshop in the factory in the raw material production area? Moreover, the production method of this product is extremely simple!" The experts also pointed out another shortcoming of the original design: it did not consider the relationship with the city. A prominent example is that the poisonous wastewater from the electroplating section was originally planned to be discharged into the river along with ordinary dirty water. The experts said:
    "It should not be discharged into the river without treatment, because the tap water consumed by the people of the city is also taken from the river." At the suggestion of the experts, a special wastewater treatment equipment was added to extract the toxic substances before discharging them into the river, thus making up for this defect.
    Secondly, the design of a factory must be based on rich and correct original data. This requires designers to have a realistic and truth-seeking spirit and a style of in-depth investigation and research. Before the design, they must investigate the geology, temperature, wind direction, rainfall, snowfall, water supply, drainage, transportation, raw materials, and building materials supply of the factory site. The existing data must also be reviewed and corrected in order to make a correct design. Initially, it was determined that the factory would be built in a certain city. When selecting the factory site, the local people had pointed out that there had been earthquakes there in the past. The geological research institute also provided relevant information in this regard. However, the designers at the time thought that these materials were dispensable, and that designing a factory was just drawing a floor plan, building a factory building, and placing a machine order. Therefore, a special railway line was built, warehouses were built, and a large number of building materials were transported in, preparing to start construction. Fortunately, the Northeast Industrial Department discovered this serious problem not long afterward and immediately resolutely stopped it. Otherwise, the consequences of building a heavy factory building on such an unstable foundation would have been unimaginable. However, this style of being divorced from reality, that is, rashly designing and constructing without prior investigation and surveying, has already caused huge losses to the country of more than 2 billion yuan. After the factory site was changed to another city, the designers still did not learn this lesson. For example, when designing the factory's sewer, the depth of the sewer was determined and construction was carried out without investigating the elevation of a river outside the factory that receives dirty water. In fact, the elevation of the riverbed was almost the same as the depth of the sewer. Once the river water rose, backflow would inevitably occur, and the sewer would lose its function. When designing the boiler room, it was built in the center of the factory area without investigating the wind direction. As a result, in the winter season when the most coal was burned, the smoke and ash blew towards the insulation workshop. The insulation workshop requires absolute cleanliness to ensure the high insulation of the products, which created a defect for the factory. The design of the "workers' village" did not investigate the different angles of sunlight in the local winter and summer seasons, and subjectively decided on the location and direction. As a result, the built dormitories received a lot of sunlight in the summer, but could not see the sun in the winter. When designing the heating equipment for the medium-sized motor factory building, the designers subjectively estimated without conducting an investigation, and with some unreasonable cold-proof equipment, the indoor temperature only remained at about 1 degree Celsius last winter, which delayed the installation project by two months. Heating equipment had to be added and modified this summer.
    Third, the design of a factory must absorb the highest scientific achievements as actively as possible in order to maximize the efficiency of various equipment, thereby improving the factory's production capacity and effectively using the country's investment. This requires designers to overcome backward bourgeois technical viewpoints, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and deeply understand the various advanced technical quotas that have been applied to production in various industrial and mining enterprises. The mechanical utilization efficiency of the factory's initial design was that each machine operated on average for 2,500 hours per year. Based on two shifts per day and eight hours per shift, each machine only operated on average for 156 days and 6 hours per year, and was idle for more than half of the time. The designers' basis was: 1. The worker attendance rate was 85 percent, and some machines were shut down because no one was watching them. 2. The labor efficiency of night shift workers was lower than that of day shift workers, at least 10 percent lower, which also affected the efficiency of the machines. 3. The machines would often break down, and there should be 30 percent of the total time for repairs. 4. Consider unexpected accidents such as power outages and insufficient raw material supply. When the Soviet experts reviewed the design, they pointed out that this indicator was extremely backward and caused great waste to the country. The experts refuted the above-mentioned reasons: 1. In socialist state-owned factories, workers' labor efficiency only increases and does not decrease, and his attendance rate should not be considered at all. 2. The designers of the new factory should create reasonable working conditions for night shift workers, instead of reducing his quota; at the same time, for a machine tool, there is no reason to say that the night shift would take more time to do the work that the day shift takes two hours to complete. 3. In the New China, the working class has become the master of the country, and they will take extra care of the country's machines. If a responsibility system is established, the repair time will be greatly reduced. In the Soviet Union, the repair time is only 5 to 7.4 percent, and accidents should not occur in state-owned factories. After designing based on the opinions of Soviet experts, the use time of mechanical equipment jumped from 2,500 hours per year to 4,161 hours per year. Without increasing the state's investment by a penny, the factory's production capacity increased by 24 percent. In this regard, the experts pointed out that there were many shortcomings in the design. For example, where machinery could be used, the design used manual labor; where a part could be manufactured in one process, the design stipulated three processes. However, this idea of ​​valuing and disseminating advanced experience was not immediately accepted by all designers. When designing the cutting speed of machine tools, they again followed the backward American quota, determining a cutting speed of 20 to 30 meters per minute. At that time, some people pointed out that such a speed was too slow and cited the fact that high-speed cutting methods had been widely adopted in various Northeast machinery factories as proof. However, according to such a cutting speed design, in order to achieve the increased planned output modified according to the opinions of Soviet experts, it would be necessary to increase the mechanical equipment by two to three times, and the area of ​​the originally designed factory building would have to be expanded to accommodate these equipment. Obviously, these would increase the country's investment. This erroneous design thinking was criticized in the ideological remolding movement that was launched not long ago, and the designers also realized that disseminating advanced experience is the concrete manifestation of patriotism in daily work. As one designer said in his self-criticism: "In the past, I always thought, however I design, the country has to pay accordingly. I never combined the use of national investment with my own emotions, and I never considered where this money came from and where it would be used." Therefore, based on the specific situation of high-speed cutting methods used by the production department in practice, the cutting speed of machine tools was increased to 100 meters per minute. As a result of designing according to this indicator, the factory not only does not need to add equipment, but on the contrary, the output can be increased by another 20 percent, which is 80 percent higher than the initially designed output.
    Fourth, it is necessary to carefully consider economically how to most reasonably and maximize the use of national wealth and resources. This requires designers to have a high degree of economic accounting viewpoints. When Soviet experts went to review the design, they pointed out three principles. The first is: save as much as possible, and never spend a penny more of the country's money. The original design of the factory was to build a substation, but there was a substation of the Power Supply Bureau less than 100 meters away from the factory. The experts pointed out that such duplicate construction was absolutely not allowed. At the same time, the experts reduced the reserve capacity of the transformer equipment by one-half without affecting the power safety of the entire factory. These two items alone saved 7.5 billion yuan, which could be used to build a factory building with a reinforced concrete structure of 4,000 square meters. For some machine tools that manufacture special-performance parts and run for less than ten days or half a month per year, such as basket-type long-head punching machines, punching machines, drawing punching machines, and trimming punching machines, the experts suggested removing them from the design and having other machine tools replace the small number of parts they produce. This adjustment increased the load rate of some heavy machine tools from 30 percent to 60 percent. The second principle pointed out by the experts is: it must be based on ensuring production. The original design did not consider this point carefully. For example, the number of people to assemble a certain large generator was determined to be a group, and the time was five months. Soviet experts suggested increasing the number of people to two groups. He said this has two advantages: one is to shorten the assembly time to three months, thereby accelerating the turnover of funds; the other is to reduce the area of ​​the heavy assembly factory building. If it is calculated based on assembling one unit in five months, it will require an area of ​​3,500 square meters. According to the design of assembling it in three months, it can be reduced to 2,400 square meters. The insulation workshop was originally equipped with 20 janitors. The experts said: "Manufacturing insulation products cannot tolerate dust, otherwise the compressive strength of the products will be reduced, and major accidents may be caused if other departments use them. Therefore, the insulation workshop must be regularly wiped with water every day to maintain absolute cleanliness. Twenty janitors are not enough, at least double the number." The third principle instructed by the experts is: obtain materials locally as much as possible, and do not order from abroad what China can produce itself. For example, one item in the product plan is shellac tubes. The experts advocated using artificial resin tubes instead, because China cannot currently produce shellac.
    Fifth, in terms of working conditions, it is necessary to carefully consider how to strengthen technical security equipment and welfare equipment in order to ensure production and the safety and health of workers. This requires designers to have a high degree of working-class viewpoints. The initial design of the factory had major defects in this regard, which can be seen from a designer's self-criticism. He said: "In the United States, we were exposed to the idea that machines are more important than people." When Soviet experts reviewed the design, they first criticized this point and said: "Workers are more important than anything else. Without them, we cannot build a factory." Under the guidance of Soviet experts, safety facilities were gradually added. For example, all energized equipment did not have safety devices. Once there was a leak, it would endanger the lives of workers. Soviet experts suggested installing grounding equipment. Even if there was a leak, it would be transmitted to the ground along this equipment and would not endanger workers. Electric tools for riveting and welding were also changed to pneumatic according to this spirit, allowing workers to operate under safe conditions. In the past, the oven in the medium-sized motor workshop was in the center of the factory building. The temperature was very high and there was no fire protection equipment. It released foul odors and there was no ventilation equipment, which was extremely unsafe for production and workers' health. Now, under the guidance of Soviet experts, it has been moved to a corner of the factory building and isolated from the factory building, and a fume hood has been installed. As for the insulation factory, workers must often operate in the suffocating odors of chemical medicines. The designers have installed special ventilation and ventilation equipment for them, extracting all the odors from the factory building on the one hand, and sending in fresh air with a certain temperature and humidity on the other hand. All workshop designs have now added living rooms (including changing rooms, bathrooms, rest rooms, and canteens, etc.).
    From the above points of experience of the factory, we can see that design is the product of the close combination of political, economic, and technical factors. Any error in any aspect directly affects the correctness and rationality of the design itself. At the same time, we can also see that the main reason for the many errors in the initial design of the factory is that the designers are restricted by American bourgeois technical theories and cannot consider the needs of the country and the fundamental interests of the working class. Therefore, while absorbing the above experience and lessons, designers must continue to overcome bourgeois ideology, actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and complete the glorious and arduous design tasks!

    学习苏联专家的设计思想
    白天明
    东北新建的电工四厂，已经动工了，现部分工程已经完成并开始生产，全部工程完工需要四年时间。
    这样一座庞大的工厂，设计是异常复杂的。现在，它所依据的正确的设计，是经过四次大修改，花费将近两年的时间才完成的。这两年的过程，是一个曲折艰巨的思想斗争过程，从这里充分地看到了错误的设计思想的危害性和资本主义设计技术的落后性，同时，也充分地看到了苏联社会主义设计思想的优越性。
    一九五○年一月，全国第一次电器工作会议决定：为适应全国日益发展的经济建设事业的需要，在东北修筑一座新式的电机工厂，并要东北人民政府工业部电器工业管理局担负设计任务。当时，东北电器工业管理局的一批技术人员，因为过去长期在美国学习，就业，加以参加新中国建设事业为期短暂，思想上还存在着较浓厚的资本主义技术观点。因此，当他们接受这一设计任务时，便沿用了资本主义的技术观点和方法，全套搬用了过去美国西屋电器制造公司给伪“资源委员会”设计的一座电机工厂的全部资料。他们初步设计的是综合性电机工厂，产品种类繁多，但最主要的产品——大型发电设备仍然
    不能大量制造，后果必然是：工厂的先天不足，依旧没有摆脱殖民地的经济性质。这和新中国重工业建设的方针是背道而驰的。一九五一年下半年，经先后请教了几位苏联专家，这才逐渐发现了原设计当
    中的许多严重错误，而在专家的指导下，也逐一地
    改正了这些错误，使得该厂的设计变成正确、合理，
    基本上适应人民中国工业化的需要了。苏联专家指
    导整个设计的最大贡献是：使得该厂由综合性的但
    又不能合理地生产主要产品的工厂，变成了可以集
    中地制造大型发电设备的具有独立生产性能的工厂
    了，同时提供给我们先进的定额，使这个工厂的生
    产能力比最初的设计提高了百分之八十。在这两年
    当中，我们的设计人员获得了丰富的经验教训，从
    苏联专家那里受到了很多可贵的教益。
    该厂设计的经验教训告诉我们：必须学习并且树
    立牢固的先进的设计思想，才能够保证做出正确的、合理的设计来。
    一座新建工厂的设计，都必须首先把它作为国家整个计划经济的一部分，从整个国民经济的发展来确定它的产品、规模、地点；同时，也要考虑到与其他经济的配合以及与城市建设计划的配合，以适合国民经济发展的需要。该厂在最初的设计当中，就没有掌握这个原则，而是孤立地就一个工厂来考虑。在制订部分大型产品方案时，不是深入了解当前和将来经济建设的发展情况和计划，根据它对动力设备的要求，确定产品的规范和数量，而是先把机床设备确定之后，根据它们的生产能力和性能来确定产品的规格和数量。设计人员认为：生产任务只能是一个假定的，设计时是一套，正式生产时又是一套。显然，这样设计的结果将会把工厂从国民经济计划中割裂开来。在确定产品种类时，设计人员把这座工厂设计成为一座综合性的电机工厂，大小型水、火力发电设备、大小电动机、各式变压器、开关设备以及绝缘材料等等电工主要产品，打算全部制造；而小型电机的制造比率又设计得相当大。相反地，大型发电设备和电动机的制造比率设计得很少，两者极不相衬。苏联专家在审核设计的时候，首先就批判了这一点，专家认为：
    “制造发电机的目的，在于供应工业生产的动力，假如我们制造一台一千瓩发电机的时候，就必须要制造合计二千五百瓩的中小型电动设备，才能把它发出的电气变成动力，运用到工业生产上来。用这个原则来衡量设计，就发现它生产小型电动机多，大型发电设备的生产比例小，这显然是不适合目前新中国的经济建设需要的，同时，一个工厂制造这样种类繁多的产品，势必是规模大、产量少，每种产品的容量小，这绝不符合科学管理的原则的。”在专家的指导下，才正确地确定了大、中、小型电机的产量比例，产品种类也简化为只生产一种发电机，和为适应电力发展制造一部分电动机、绝缘材料。同时，专家也指出了原设计的另一个缺点，是没考虑到原料供应与产品销售的配合问题。譬如，绝缘材料之一的胶木粉所需要的原料，要从一千多里以外的地区运来，而大量需要这种产品的工厂，却仍在原料产区之内。专家说：“这样运来运去，给国家造成很大的浪费，何不就在原料产区的工厂内设一个车间，而且这种产品的生产方式是极其简单的！”专家还指出原设计的又一个缺点：没考虑到和城市的关系。突出的例子是电镀工段的含毒废水，原设计打算和普通脏水一同排到江里去。专家说：
    “它不应当不经处理就排到江里，因为全市人民饮用的自来水也是取自江中。”在专家的提议下，增设了一部特殊的处理废水设备，把有毒物提取之后再排到江里，才弥补了这个缺陷。
    其次，设计一个工厂必须有丰富而又正确的原始资料为依据，这就需要设计人员具有实事求是的精神，深入调查研究的作风，在设计之前，必须把厂址的地质、气温、风向、雨量、雪量、水源供应、排水、交通运输、原材料及建筑材料供应等情况调查清楚，对旧有的资料，也要经过审核、订正，这样才能做出正确的设计来。最初，曾确定该厂建在某城，在选厂址时，当地老百姓就提出过：这里过去发生过地震；地质研究所也提供了有关这方面的资料。但当时的设计人员却以为这些材料是可有可无的，设计一个工厂，只是画画平面图、盖起厂房、开个机器订货单就完了。于是，就修了专用铁路线，盖起仓库，运来了大批的建筑材料，准备兴工。幸而不久东北工业部发现了这个严重问题，立即坚决制止，不然，在这样不稳固的地基上盖起重型厂房来，前途是不堪设想的。但是，这种事先不调查勘测即草率设计施工的脱离实际的作风，已经给国家造成了二十亿元以上的巨大损失。厂址改在另一城市之后，设计人员们仍未吸取这个教训。譬如在设计厂内下水道的时候，没有调查厂外接受脏水的一条河的标高，就确定了下水道的深度并进行施工。实际上，河底的标高与下水道的深度相差无几，河水一大，必然发生倒灌现象，下水道将失去作用。在设计锅炉房的时候，没有调查风向，就建在厂区中心，结果，冬季燃煤最多的季节，烟灰都向绝缘车间刮去。而绝缘车间又需要绝对的清洁才能保证产品的高度绝缘性，这就给工厂造成了一个缺陷。设计“工人村”没有调查当地日光在冬夏两季投射角度的不同，即主观地决定了位置与方向，结果，盖的宿舍夏天日光多，冬天反而见不着太阳。在设计中型电机厂房的采暖设备时，设计人员不进行调查即主观地估计，加上有些防寒设备的不合理，去年冬天室内只保持摄氏一度左右，因此延迟了两个月的安装工程，今夏又不得不增添和改装采暖设备。
    第三，设计一个工厂必须以最积极的精神，尽可能地吸取科学上的最高成就，才能高度发挥各种设备效能，从而提高工厂的生产能力，有效地使用国家的投资，这就需要设计人员克服落后的资产阶级的技术观点，学习苏联先进经验，深入了解各工矿企业已经应用在生产上的各种先进技术定额。该厂最初设计的机械运用效率是，每年每台平均运转两千五百小时，以每天两班生产每班运转八小时计算，每台机械每年平均只运转一百五十六天六小时，有半年以上的时间是停着不动的。设计人员的根据是：一、工人出勤率为百分之八十五，有些机械因无人看管而停运。二、夜班工人的劳动效率比白班工人的低，至少打九折，因而也影响机械的效率。三、机械常常会坏的，全年要有百分之三十的修理时间。四、考虑如停电、原材料供应不及等意外事故的发生。苏联专家在审核设计的时候，指出这种指标是极其落后的，给国家造成极大的浪费。专家批驳了上述几种根据：一、在社会主义性质的国营工厂内，工人的劳动效率是有加无已的，他的出勤率，根本不应加以考虑。二、新厂设计者应给夜班工人创造合理的劳动条件，而不是减低他的定额；同时，对于一台机床，白天需要两小时做出来的工作，没有理由说夜班要用更多的时间。三、在新中国，工人阶级已成为国家的主人，他们对国家的机器会加倍爱护的，如果再建立起负责制，检修时间更会大大减少。在苏联，检修时间只为百分之五到七·四，意外事故是不应在国营工厂内出现的。以苏联专家的意见为根据进行设计之后，机械设备的运用时，由每年两千五百台时一跃而为四千
    一百六十一台时，不增加国家的分文投资，该厂的生产能力即提高百分之二十四。在这一方面，专家指出设计有许多缺点，譬如可以用机械的地方，设计是用人力；可以用一道程序制造一个部件的，设计上规定用三道程序。但是，这重视与传播先进经验的思想，并未立即被所有的设计人员所接受。在设计机床的切削速度时，又因袭了落后的美国的定额，确定每分钟切削二十至三十公尺。当时，有人曾提出这样的速度太慢，并引用各东北机械工厂已经广泛采用了高速切削法的事实做为证明。可是，按照这样的切削速度设计，要想达到根据苏联专家意见修改提高了的计划产量，就必须增加两倍到三倍的机械设备，随之也必须扩大原设计的厂房的面积来容纳这些设备。显然，这些都要增加国家的投资。这种错误的设计思想，在不久前展开的思想改造运动中受到了批判，设计人员也认识到传播先进经验是爱国主义思想在日常工作中的具体表现，正如一位设计人员检讨所说：“过去我总是想，我怎样设计国家就得怎样拿钱，从没有把使用国家投资和自己情感结合起来，更没考虑这些钱来自哪里用之何处。”于是，才根据生产部门在实际当中运用高速切削法的具体情况，把机床的切削速度提高到每分钟一百公尺。依据这一指标设计的结果，工厂不仅不需增添设备，相反地，产量又可提高百分之二十，比最初设计的产量提高百分之八十。
    第四，必须在经济上慎重地考虑如何最合理地与最大限度地运用国家财富和资源，这就需要设计人员具备高度的经济核算观点。苏联专家去审核设计的时候，指出三个原则，第一是：能省就省，绝不多花国家一分一文。原设计工厂要修建一个变电所，但距离工厂不出一百公尺就有一座电业局的变电所，专家指出这种重复修建是绝对不允许的。同时，专家又在不影响全厂用电安全的条件下，把变压设备的准备容量降低二分之一。仅此两项，就节省七十五亿元，可以增建一座四千平方公尺的钢筋混凝土结构的厂房。对于一些制造特殊性能部件的、每年合起来又运转不到十天或半月的机床，像花篮式长头冲床，冲型冲床，引拉冲床，切边冲床等机械，专家则提议从设计上去掉，它们生产的少量部件，由其他机床代替。这样一调整，就把一些重型机床的负荷率由百分之三十提高到百分之六十。专家指出的第二个原则是：必须以保证生产为前提。原设计在这一点考虑得不周到。譬如装配某种大型发电机的人数确定为一组，时间为五个月。苏联专家提议把人数增加到两个组。他说这有两个好处：一是把装配时间缩短为三个月，从而加速资金的周转；再是减少了重型装配厂房的面积，若按五个月装一台计算，则需占地三千五百平方公尺，按三个月装成设计，则可减至两千四百平方公尺。绝缘车间最初配备二十个勤杂人员，专家说：“制造绝缘产品是见不得灰尘的，否则将会减低产品的抗压力，其他部门使用就可能造成重大事故。因此，绝缘车间每天必须经常以水擦抹保持绝对的清洁，二十位勤杂人员是不够的，至少要增加一倍。”专家指示的第三个原则是：尽可能就地取材，中国自己能生产的就不到国外去订货。譬如生产品方案中有一项是虫胶管。专家则主张改用人造树脂管代替，因为中国目前还不能生产虫胶。
    第五，必须在劳动条件上，周密地考虑如何加强技术保安设备和福利设备，以保障生产和工人的安全健康，这就需要设计者有高度的工人阶级观点。该厂的最初设计，在这一方面有着极大缺陷，这可从一位设计人员的检讨中看到，他说：“在美国，我们耳濡目染是机器比人重要。”而苏联专家在审核设计的时候，首先批判了这一点说：“工人比什么都重要，离开他们就不能建设工厂。”在苏联专家指导之下，才逐渐地增添了安全设施。譬如，全部带电设备都没有安全装置，一旦漏电就会危及工人的生命。苏联专家则建议安设接地设备，即或漏了电，也会顺着这种设备传到地里而不会危及工人。像铆焊的电动工具，也根据这种精神改为风动，让工人在安全的条件下操作。中型电机车间的烘炉过去是在厂房中心，温度很高无防火设备，放散臭气又无通风换气设备，对于生产及工人健康都极不安全。现在，根据苏联专家的指导搬到厂房一角，并与厂房隔离，安上了抽风罩。至于像绝缘厂，工人必须经常在窒人鼻息的化学药品的臭气中操作，设计人员都为其安设了特殊的通风换气设备，一方面把厂房内所有的臭气抽出，一方面送进有一定温度和湿度的新鲜空气。所有车间的设计，目前都添设了生活室（包括更衣室、浴室、休息室和饭堂等）。
    从该厂以上几点的经验看来，设计是政治、经济、技术三个因素紧密结合的产物，任何一方面的错误都直接影响到设计本身的正确性、合理性，同时我们也可以看到，造成该厂最初设计当中的许多错误的主要原因，则是设计人员受到美国资产阶级技术理论的束缚，不能考虑国家的需要，以及工人阶级的根本利益。因此，在吸取上述经验教训同时，设计人员必须继续克服资产阶级思想，积极学习苏联的先进经验，完成光荣而艰巨的设计任务！
