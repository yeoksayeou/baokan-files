Introducing the Soviet Color Film "Donbass Miners"
Wu Tian

Screenplay: Gorbatov, Alekseyev　Chief Director: Zhukov　Translator: Meng Guangjun Produced by Moscow Gorky Film Studio　Translated by Northeast Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau

The Soviet film "Donbass Miners," which won the Stalin Prize in 1951 and the International Film Labor Award in 1951, is a film with profound educational significance. It depicts how workers in the Soviet socialist social system labor and live. It allows us to see the communist vision and encourages us to make unremitting efforts to achieve this goal.

Like all other excellent Soviet films, it outstandingly portrays living Soviet people and expresses their thoughts, feelings, and noble qualities. In the film, we specifically see the arduous efforts they make to implement the complete mechanization and automation of the production process, and how their thoughts, feelings, and lives change when faced with new things—the appearance of coal mining combines.

In this film, the author not only expresses the mechanization of the heavy work of coal mining, but also raises the issues of improving labor organization, improving skills, and training new technical personnel. The film depicts Stalin's instructions on this issue, as well as the handling of this issue by the Party's Provincial Committee Secretary Kolavzov and the mining area's general branch secretary Paul, which are all clarifications of this issue.

When the author began to create this film, coal mining combines were only being tested in mines and had not yet been widely promoted. With keen eyes, the author observed what kind of changes the coal mining combine would bring to people's lives, so he firmly grasped this theme and depicted what was about to appear in real life. Because the author grasped the laws of life's development, he not only saw today, but also foresaw tomorrow. This kind of scientific foresight is precisely what artists must possess.

The film powerfully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system by depicting the family of the socialist labor hero Nedaolian. The author portrays a picture of strong contrast. The hellish life that Nedaolian lived before the revolution is a stark contrast to the happy life of Soviet workers today.

Therefore, Nedaolian's joy and happiness, as well as his dedication of all his energy to the labor of the motherland, are very natural. He not only saw himself, but also saw how his peers, such as the mine foreman Golovi, were living a good life. He saw an even more beautiful future for the younger generation: his son became an engineer, and his daughter also embarked on the same path. All the workers are living happy lives and changing their mode of labor, and he is working hard for this.

His speech at the Miners' Day celebration大会正说明了: shows exactly where the happy life of every Soviet people comes from, and what they are working tirelessly for. They are working not only for the happiness of their generation, but also, as Nedaolian said, "for their children and grandchildren." He said to the children: "This coal, this mine, we will all leave to you, and the combines are all yours too. This Donbass, this happy, beautiful, good place is all for you, you are lucky!"

We seem to see communism right in front of us. Nedaolian is not an old man; he is like a vigorous young man.

Nedaolian has the deepest understanding of the fact that using coal mining combines can reduce labor and increase productivity. He said: "The coal cutter gave me twenty more years of life, and the coal mining combine will add another twenty years to my life." This sentence illustrates the basic significance of the socialist reform of the Donbass coal mine. Mechanization has transformed the mine into an underground factory, and the traditionally heavy physical labor of miners has gradually been transformed into mental labor. Young people support this production reform with the same enthusiasm, and they express their eager feelings in their songs: "It's outdated, my lover, to go down the mine with a shovel; quickly learn to drive a combine, and then ask me to marry you." The appearance of coal mining combines has brought great changes to the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the miners.

This film focuses on and comprehensively expresses the leading role of the Party. The film's director, Zhukov, wrote in his article "My Theme": "The most important task we need to solve in this film is the theme of the Party. We are very clear: if we do not show in detail how the Party and Comrade Stalin himself are thinking about and caring for the miners, then this theme has not been solved, because without showing this, we cannot actually reflect the reality that we are preparing to film."

In this film, from Stalin to the secretary of the Party's general branch in the mining area, we see an organic whole of Party leadership. Level-by-level leadership illustrates the great organizational and leading role that the Party plays in the lives of the people and in production, and this great role is concentrated in the great Stalin.

The scene in which Stalin appears is the most impressive scene in the entire film. Before this scene, although Stalin has not appeared, we feel that Stalin has been watching and caring for Donbass. The general secretary of the Party branch, Paul, persuaded Washa and other workers who doubted whether the combine could succeed: "Comrades, haven't you heard this figure, 500 million tons of coal a year? Comrade Stalin instructed us, what do you want to use to complete this 500 million ton task? Ah, with a shovel? It can't be done with a shovel, you have to use machines!"

When the Minister of Coal Industry was about to meet Stalin, he said to the Provincial Party Secretary Kolavzov: "Remember, in 1941, the German invaders still occupied Donbass, but Comrade Stalin told us to seriously prepare for the issue of restoring Donbass."

Stalin always lets us see the tomorrow of victory, and he encourages us to move forward.

We also specifically see the image of excellent Bolsheviks in other Party leaders in the film.

At the beginning of the film, we see Kolavzov—the representative of the Party in the mining area—mobilizing and talking about the situation for the experiment of the coal mining combine. Later, we see him at every key point: from inspiring workers to use machines, caring about and trying to help overcome faults, reporting the situation to Stalin, and the proposal of new problems, solving the specific problems caused by the new situation after the adoption of the combine, such as dealing with the problem of the mine foreman Golovi's request to go to teach, until finally participating in the wedding ceremony, he personally participated in it.

He runs through the entire play like a red thread. In every link, he is the executor and witness of the Party's policies. He participates in every job and promotes it. This precisely illustrates the inseparable relationship between the Party and the people. This embodies the Party characteristics of Lenin and Stalin.

Like all Party workers, Kolavzov is good at guiding and inspiring the masses. He is humorous and very amiable. In order to guide workers to understand the role of coal mining combines, he deliberately proposed a toast to the plough. He agreed with the workers' saying that the coal cutter is technology in a self-critical way, but in the laughter of everyone, he enlightened everyone by saying: "Agree that this is today's technology, but not tomorrow's." This educated the workers to look to the distance and face the future.

From him, we realize that the leadership of the Party is indispensable in people's lives.

Labor is extremely prominent in "Donbass Miners". From beginning to end, the film is full of the upsurge of labor.

We advance towards the sun,
Let our steps be more firm,
From the lita of Donbass,
We have seen the dawn of communism.
We love the motherland,
We bring warmth and light to the people.

This song expresses the great power of the Soviet people, and it inspires us to love labor and love the motherland! (Attached picture)

    介绍苏联彩色影片“顿巴斯矿工”
    吴天
    编剧：郭尔巴托夫、阿列克谢耶夫　总导演：茹可夫　翻译：孟广钧莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂出品　中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    荣获一九五一年斯大林奖和一九五一年国际电影劳动奖的苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”，是一部有深刻教育意义的影片。它描写了苏联社会主义社会制度下的工人，如何劳动，如何生活，它使我们看到了共产主义的远景，并鼓舞我们为了达到这一目的而作不懈的努力。
    它和其他一切苏联优秀的影片一样，杰出地表现了活生生的苏维埃人，表现了他们的思想、感情和高尚的品质。在影片里，我们具体地看到了他们怎样为了实行生产过程的全部机械化和自动化，而作的艰苦努力，以及他们面临新鲜事物——采煤康拜因的出现时，他们的思想、感情和生活起了什么变化。
    作者在这部电影中不仅表现了采煤这一沉重的工作的机械化，而且提出了改善劳动组织和提高业务、培养新的技术人员的问题。影片所描写的斯大林有关这一问题的指示，以及党的省委书记柯拉夫佐夫和矿区总支书记保尔有关这一问题的处理，都是这一问题的阐明。
    当作者开始创作这部电影时，采煤康拜因仅在矿井中作试验，还未大量推广。作者以敏锐的眼光，观察到采煤康拜因在人们的生活里将起什么样的变化，于是紧紧地把握住这一主题，描写了在现实生活中将要出现的东西。因为作者掌握了生活发展的规律，所以他不但看到了今天，也预见了明天。这种科学的预见性正是艺术家必须具有的。
    影片通过描写社会主义劳动英雄聂道连的一家，有力地表明了社会主义制度的优越性。作者刻画了一幅强烈对比的图画。聂道连在革命前所过的地狱一般的生活，正是现在苏维埃工人幸福生活的鲜明对照。
    因此，聂道连的欢乐和幸福，以及他把全部精力贡献给祖国的劳动乃是很自然的事。他不仅看见自己，也看见了同辈的工人，例如矿井井长郭洛维，如何过上了好日子。他更看见了年青一代人的更美丽的将来：他的儿子当了工程师，女儿也走上了同一的道路。所有的工人都过着幸福的生活，改变了劳动方式，而他也就为了这个而努力。
    他在矿工节的庆祝大会上的演说正说明了：每个苏联人民的幸福生活是从那里来的，他们又为了什么而作不懈的努力。他们不但为自己一代的幸福，而且像聂道连所说的，是“为子孙”而努力。他对孩子们说：“这煤，这矿，我们全都留给你们，康拜因也都是你们的。这顿巴斯，幸福的美丽的好地方都给你们，你们走运哪！”
    我们仿佛看见共产主义就在眼前，聂道连并不是个老头，他像个充满活力的青年一样。
    聂道连对于使用采煤康拜因，可以减轻劳动和提高生产力这一点体会最深，他说：“掘煤机给我增加了二十年的生命，采煤康拜因却还要使我的生命增加二十年。”这句话说明了顿巴斯煤矿进行社会主义改革的基本意义。机械化使矿坑变成了地下工厂，使矿工历来繁重的体力劳动逐渐改变为脑力劳动了。青年人以同样的热情拥护这一生产改革，他们用自己的歌来表达热切的心情：“过时了，我的情人，还拿铁锹下矿井；快快学会开康拜因，然后再向我求婚。”采煤康拜因的出现，使矿工们的生活、思想、感情都起了很大的变化。
    这部影片集中而又全面地表现了党的领导作用。该片导演茹可夫在“我的主题”一文里写道：“我们在这部电影里需要解决的最主要的任务是党的主题。我们很清楚：如果不详细地表现出党和斯大林同志本人是怎样地考虑和关心着矿工，那末这个主题就没有得到解决，因为不表现这点，实际上我们就不能反映出我们准备摄制影片去反映的那种现实。”
    在这部电影中，从斯大林起直到矿区党总支书记，我们看到了一个有机的党的领导整体。一级一级的领导，说明了党在人民的生活中，在生产上所起的伟大的组织、领导作用，而这一伟大作用都集中地表现在伟大的斯大林身上。
    斯大林出现的一场，是全片给人印象最深的一场。在这一场前，斯大林虽未出场，但我们感到斯大林一直在注视着、关怀着顿巴斯。党总支书记保尔，曾对怀疑康拜因能够成功的瓦夏和其他的工人进行说服：“同志们，难道你没有听见这个数目字，一年出五万万吨煤，斯大林同志指示的，你们想用什么来完成这五万万吨任务？啊，用铁锹吗？用锹是办不到的，要用机器！”
    当煤炭工业部长要去见斯大林时，他对省委书记柯拉夫佐夫说：“记得吧，一九四一年德寇还占领着顿巴斯，但斯大林同志哪，就叫我们认真地准备着复兴顿巴斯的问题。”
    斯大林总是让我们看到胜利的明天，他鼓舞着我们前进。
    我们从影片中别的党的领导者身上也具体地看到了优秀的布尔什维克的形象。
    影片一开始，我们就看到柯拉夫佐夫——这个矿区党的代表人为了试验采煤康拜因进行动员谈话的情形，以后我们在每个关键上都看到他：从启发工人运用机器，关心并设法帮助克服故障，向斯大林汇报情况，以及新的问题的提出，解决采用康拜因后，因新的情况所产生的具体问题，如处理井长郭洛维请求去教书的问题，一直到最后参加结婚典礼，他都亲自参加在里面。
    他像一条红线贯穿了全剧，在每一环节中他都是党的政策的执行者和见证人。他参加每一工作，并推进它。这正说明了党和人民的不可分的关系。这正体现了列宁、斯大林的党的特质。
    像所有党的工作者一样，柯拉夫佐夫善于诱导和启发群众。他有风趣、非常可亲。他为了引导工人认识采煤康拜因的作用，他就故意提议为耙犁干杯。他自我批评似地同意工人说截煤机是技术，但在大家哄笑中他却启发大家说：“同意这是今天的技术，但不是明天的。”这就教育了工人向远处看，面向未来。
    从他身上我们体会到党的领导是人们生活中不可缺少的。
    对于劳动，在“顿巴斯矿工”中有着极突出的描写。电影从最初到结束，全片充满了劳动的热潮。
    我们迎着太阳前进，
    让步伐迈得更坚定，
    从顿巴斯的立塔上，
    已看到共产主义的黎明。
    我们热爱祖国，
    我们给人民带来热和光明。
    这歌声表现了苏维埃人民的伟大力量，它鼓舞着我们热爱劳动，热爱祖国！（附图片）
    矿工们祝贺老工人聂道连在顿巴斯煤矿工作五十年纪念
