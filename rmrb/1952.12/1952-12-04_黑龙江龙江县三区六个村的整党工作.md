　　Party Consolidation Work in Three Districts and Six Villages of Longjiang County, Heilongjiang
            (I)
    In mid-August, the Organization Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in collaboration with county and district cadres of Longjiang County, conducted party consolidation pilot work in Dong, Xi Baitushan, Gaqiha, Changshan, Xingshan, and Houdaolao six villages in the third district of Longjiang County using a centralized training method, and achieved great results.
    After the party consolidation work group arrived in the villages, they first investigated and understood the situation, clarifying the various problems existing in these branches. Dong, Xi Baitushan and the other six villages have a total of fifty-five party members, fifty of whom came from poor peasants and farm laborers, and most of them were activists in the land reform. These party members have made many achievements in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement and other work, especially in agricultural production in 1951 and 1952, which, through organization and intensive cultivation, achieved bumper harvests, and the lives of the masses were further improved. However, on the other hand, due to a lack of systematic communist education, rich peasant ideology grew in some party members. From 1951 to the present, thirty-five of the fifty-five party members have engaged in exploitative behavior, and one has developed into a rich peasant. These party members can no longer play a leading role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Some of them have developed negative, backward-sliding thoughts, and some have even violated laws and discipline, and engaged in corruption. The above situation shows that these party organizations must undergo a rectification in terms of both ideology and organization.
    After raising the issue of party consolidation, some party members had ideological concerns, especially those with problems who feared being expelled from the party. On the other hand, some party members who usually performed better wanted to take this opportunity to severely criticize the backward party members, so that future work would be easier. Among the masses, some were also calculating about changing cadres. In response to the above situation, the work group convened branch meetings, activist meetings, mass discussion meetings, production team leader discussion meetings, and meetings with military dependents and demobilized soldiers. At these meetings, the significance of party consolidation was repeatedly publicized, so that everyone understood that party consolidation is to improve the awareness of party members, rectify the party organization, lead the masses to love the country and increase production, and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. The emotions of the party members gradually stabilized, and the masses also approved of this approach.
    Before the centralized training, in order to prevent the main cadres (party members) of each village from affecting production due to the training, the work group separately helped each branch arrange the work in the village, and solved the production problems of the families of the cadres in training.
            (II)
    At the beginning of the centralized training, communist education was first conducted. This lesson focused on the following three points: (1) The vision of communist society; (2) The current rural economy must take the road of collectivization and cooperation; (3) The leadership role of the Party in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. These lessons were all explained in connection with reality. After the lectures, the work group raised some specific issues such as hiring long-term laborers and lending at high interest rates, and mobilized everyone to discuss in connection with their own thinking. On the other hand, a member of the district committee, based on the opinions raised by the party members of each village to the leading cadres, made a review of the bureaucratic work style on behalf of the district committee, which played a great role. Many party members followed suit and reviewed their own exploitative thoughts and behaviors of hiring long-term laborers and lending at high interest rates. Guo Chengshan reviewed and said: "I lend ten dan of grain at high interest rates, demanding five percent interest in seven months, and I even claimed to be helping the poor. Now that I think about it, I really don't act like a communist party member." Du Jingchun said: "Not only did I forget my origins, hiring long-term laborers and wanting to become a rich peasant, but I also proposed in the mutual aid group that 'strong people and horses' are needed to do a good job in mutual aid. As a result, households in difficulty were excluded. This is completely contrary to the Party's policy. Now the Party is here to save me. I will say whatever I have to say, correct my mistakes, and be a good party member." Dong Guichang, a party member in Gaqiha Village, initially regarded party consolidation as a general training, saying: "I am familiar with this kind of training, going through it for twenty days won't be of any use!" But after listening to the lectures, the ideological struggle began, especially after many party members reviewed their wrong thoughts and behaviors at group meetings and general meetings, the ideological struggle became even more intense. Dong Guichang recalled the situation before liberation and today's life. He used to work for landlords like most of the people in Gaqiha Village, lacking food and clothing. After liberation, he and other farmers turned over a new leaf under the leadership of the Communist Party. Now he is cultivating more than six qing of land (one qing is equal to fifteen mu in the interior), raising two good horses, and life is getting better and better. Dong Guichang thought of all this, and then thought of the great future of communism, so he decided to thoroughly confess his mistakes to the Party. Dong Guichang reviewed: "...Last year I hired a long-term laborer, and my family gave him bad food and didn't allow him to slack off. Isn't this a change in quality! I can't get along with the masses. Before, I said against my conscience that the masses were difficult to lead, but in fact, it was all because I was too selfish, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, I didn't want to use my seven-year-old horse, so I forced other people to use their three-year-old colt, and it collapsed. Last year there was a spring drought, and it was obviously not good to plant early, and the members of the mutual aid group were unwilling to plant early, but I insisted that everyone plant mine first and then theirs. Later, the crops in my field grew better than others. This spring, the rain was good and suitable for early planting. When the mutual aid group was discussing spring planting, I said, 'Last year I let you plant first, but you were unwilling, so this year I want to plant first.' Everyone had a lot of opinions, but they didn't dare to raise them. The Party educated me to serve the people in everything, but I was planning for myself everywhere, taking advantage of the masses, and not acting like a communist party member at all." Finally, Dong Guichang made a guarantee to the Party that under the education of the Party and under the supervision of the masses, he would correct his mistakes and be a good party member. Through the criticism of this specific case, everyone realized that "the exploitative thinking of rich peasants is incompatible with the communist thinking of communist party members. When party members exploit others, their thinking has changed." Finally, everyone further analyzed the root causes of the rich peasant thinking. Some party members said: "This is influenced by the old rich peasants." Some said: "This is influenced by urban merchants." After the leadership's enlightenment, many people realized that in addition to these influences, the spontaneous capitalist factors of the small-scale peasant economy are the root of rich peasant thinking. This made everyone deeply understand the significance of the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation.
    After these ideological problems were resolved, most of the party members felt relaxed and happy, and expressed that from today onwards, they would take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Cui Zhensheng, a party member in Xibaitushan Village, proposed "We guarantee that each person will lead the masses to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation after we go back." Other party members also said: "We must make a big change when we go back."
    In the discussion on organizing mutual aid groups, the work group found that some party members' understanding of the mutual aid and cooperation policy was vague. Some people did not understand the significance of implementing the principle of mutual benefit, while others did not understand the principles of organizing mutual aid groups. Based on this situation, the work group educated everyone on the mutual aid and cooperation policy, focusing on the following points: (1) Taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation is the Party's basic policy for developing the economy in rural areas. The branch must guarantee the implementation of this policy, and party members must participate in and lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement well. At the same time, it was made clear that there is a distinction between inside and outside the party. The Party's social policy allows the existence of rich peasants, but it does not mean that rich peasants are allowed to exist within the Party. (2) The organization of mutual aid and cooperative organizations must implement the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and the development of production. (3) Select typical examples of mutual aid groups, analyze the characteristics of various types of mutual aid groups and their leadership methods. (4) Study the different characteristics and requirements of mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, and the conditions that must be met for the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. (5) It was explained that the leadership and exemplary role of rural party members are the fundamental conditions for carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After the above issues were resolved, the education of the eight standards for communist party members continued, and the coercive commandism and detachment from the masses of some party members, as well as the bad behaviors of individual embezzlers and extortionists, were emphasized and criticized. The coercive commandism that should be the responsibility of the higher authorities was reviewed by the higher-level cadres. In this way, everyone consciously and voluntarily reviewed their coercive commandism. Party members who were exploited by landlords also reviewed their thoughts and behaviors of losing their stand.
            (III)
    After the education on the standards of party members, the registration, review, and handling work began. Before registration, education on loyalty and honesty was carried out for party members, and the significance of registration was explained. Because the party members knew how to be a qualified party member, the ideological struggle of the party members was very intense during registration. Party member Sun Quan struggled for more than a day before registering. At this time, the work group paid attention to understanding the ideological situation of each party member, and conducted education according to different ideological situations. For those who were determined to be party members, they were told that as long as they were determined to correct their mistakes and make practical efforts towards the eight standards of communist party members, they could register as party members; for some who were not determined to be party members but were afraid of being laughed at if they did not register, they were told that being a party member is a conscious and voluntary matter, and not registering does not prevent them from doing revolutionary work outside the party. After two days, fifty party members registered, and five did not register. At the end of the registration, the leaders encouraged the registered party members to strive to be fully qualified party members; they also educated and comforted those who did not register, and pointed out that if they still wanted to register, they could still request registration. A person named Lin Changfa requested registration. The main reason why Lin Changfa did not register before was because he had had improper relations with three women, so he did not dare to register. After studying the matter, the branch believed that as long as Lin Changfa earnestly corrected his mistakes, he could still be a party member, and the branch approved Lin Changfa's request. Other people who did not register also expressed that they would help the Party do a good job in the future.
    After registration, appraisal was conducted by the branch as a unit, mainly to enable party members to fully and correctly recognize their ideological quality, level of awareness, and determine the direction of future struggle. After the appraisal, the review and handling were carried out. When discussing the punishment of specific individuals, everyone initially had some extreme emotions and proposed overly high punishments. After studying and researching the Party's policies, they were able to decide on punishments according to the principle of "strict ideological criticism and lenient organizational handling" stipulated by the Central Committee. For example, regarding the punishment of Li Zifeng, the secretary of the Dongbaitushan Village branch, some advocated probation within the Party, some advocated revocation of work, and some advocated giving a warning. After research, it was unanimously agreed that Li Zifeng's main mistake was having a coercive commandism style, and he had made a profound review of himself and expressed his determination to correct his mistakes, so it was decided not to give him a punishment. For some party members whose problems had not yet been fully clarified, in order to be cautious, it was decided to clarify them before handling them. For Kong Lingfa, a class alien who had infiltrated the Party, and Cai Guozhi, a degenerate element, everyone unanimously agreed to expel them from the Party. These punishments were finally approved by the County Party Committee.
            (IV)
    After reviewing and proposing handling opinions, the training class ended, and the cadres of the party consolidation work group returned to the village with the party members to conduct democratic supplementary lessons. First, two or three village or village-wide mass meetings and village cadre meetings were held. At these meetings, the cadres explained to the masses the process and problems solved in this party consolidation. After the meeting, opinions from the masses on the party member cadres were collected. The branch made a careful study of these opinions and determined the handling method. The branch decided that all those who had problems and had many opinions from the masses should be reviewed to the masses in various ways. This work was carried out very well, and many people were very moved after listening to the party members' reviews. Some said: "The Communist Party is good, and in a few days, it has educated these party members so well." The relationship between party members and the masses has been greatly improved. After Li Zifeng's review at the meeting, the villagers said that the branch secretary had really changed for the better. In the past, he would not have admitted his mistakes like this, and they went to Li Zifeng to talk to him in twos and threes. Although individual people with thoughts of revenge satirized Li Zifeng, Li Zifeng was not angry and patiently explained to them. At this time, the cadres of the work group announced the results of the party consolidation to the masses and ended the handling work. Then, a meeting of party members was held to summarize the work of the branch, carry out education on democratic centralism, re-elect the branch committee members, and arrange the current work.
    After the party consolidation, a new atmosphere emerged in each village. First of all, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in each village has been further developed during the autumn harvest. For example, in Gaqiha Village, there were only five permanent mutual aid groups before the party consolidation. After the party consolidation, due to the increased awareness of the party members, they actively led the masses in mutual aid and cooperation. Seventeen permanent mutual aid groups, eight seasonal mutual aid groups, and two temporary mutual aid groups were organized in the village. Now only eighteen households have not participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The production work of these mutual aid groups has been significantly improved, and plans for using new agricultural tools have also been put forward. Because the party members played an exemplary role, the enthusiasm of the masses in the autumn harvest was greatly increased, thus shortening the autumn harvest time. From the work situation in this period, the branch has indeed become the leading core. Many people are willing to join the mutual aid groups led by the party members and often talk to the party members to solve various problems.

### 黑龙江龙江县三区六个村的整党工作

　　黑龙江龙江县三区六个村的整党工作
            （一）
    八月中旬，中共黑龙江省委组织部协同龙江县县区干部，在龙江县第三区的东、西白土山、嘎气哈、长山、兴山、后道老等六个村采用集训的方法，进行整党试点工作，取得很大的收获。
    整党工作组到村后，首先调查了解情况，弄清这些支部中存在着的各种问题。东、西白土山等六个村，共有党员五十五名，其中有五十名出身于贫雇农，而且大部分是土地改革中的积极分子。这些党员在领导互助合作运动和其他工作中都做出了不少成绩，特别是一九五一、五二两年的农业生产，经过组织起来、精耕细作，获得了丰收，群众的生活得到了进一步的改善。但在另一方面，由于缺乏系统的共产主义教育，在一部分党员中，滋长了富农思想。从一九五一年到现在，五十五名党员中就有三十五名有过剥削行为，并有一名已发展成为富农。这些党员在互助合作运动中已不能起领导作用。其中有些人滋长了消极退坡思想，有的甚至违法乱纪、贪污腐化。上述情况说明了这些党组织无论在思想上，在组织上，都必须进行一次整顿。
    在提出整党问题后，有些党员是有思想顾虑的，特别是有毛病的党员害怕被整出党。而另一方面，有些平素表现较好的党员想趁此狠狠整落后党员，使今后的工作好作些。在群众中也有些人在核计着调换干部的事情。针对上述情况，工作组就召开支部大会、积极分子会议、群众座谈会、生产组长座谈会、军属和转业军人座谈会，在这些会议上，反复宣传整党的意义，使大家懂得了整党是为了提高党员觉悟，整顿党的组织，领导群众爱国增产，走互助合作的道路。党员的情绪也就逐渐安定下来，群众也赞成这种作法。
    集训之前，为了不使各村主要干部（党员）因集训而影响生产，工作组分别帮助各支部布置了村里的工作，并解决了集训干部家里的生产问题。
            （二）
    集训开始，首先进行共产主义教育。这一课着重讲以下三点：（一）共产主义社会的远景；（二）当前的农村经济要走合作化集体化的道路；（三）党在互助合作运动中的领导作用。这些课都是联系实际来讲解的。讲课后，工作组就提出了一些关于雇长工、放高利贷等具体问题，发动大家联系自己思想进行讨论。另一方面，由区委委员根据各村党员向领导干部所提的意见，代表区委作了关于官僚主义作风的检讨，起了很大作用。许多党员就跟着检讨了自己雇长工、放高利贷的剥削思想和行为。郭成山检讨说：“我放十石高利贷，七个月就要五分利，还硬说是帮助穷人。现在想来，真不像个共产党员。”杜景春说：“我不光自己忘了本，雇长工，想当富农，还在互助组内提出‘人强马壮’，才能搞好互助。结果，把困难户都排斥出去。这和党的方针完全相违背的。现在党来挽救我，我要有啥说啥，改正自己错误，作一个好党员。”嘎气哈村党员董贵昌起初把整党当作一般的训练，说：“训练班这条路我已走熟了，再去转它二十天，没有啥！”但在他听课以后，思想上就开始了斗争，特别是在好多党员在小组会和大会上检讨了自己的错误思想和行为后，思想斗争更加激烈。董贵昌想起了解放前的情景和今天的生活。他原来像嘎气哈村大部分群众一样，给地主扛活，少吃没穿。解放后，他和其他农民一样在共产党的领导下翻了身。现在他种着六垧多地（一垧等于关内十五亩），养着两匹好马，日子越过越好。董贵昌想起这一切，又想到共产主义的远大前途，于是决心把自己的错误彻底向党交代清楚。董贵昌检讨说：“……去年我雇了长工，家里给长工吃坏的东西，又不准他少干活。这不是变了质吗！和群众关系搞不好，以前是昧着良心说群众不好领导，其实都因为我自私自利心太大，引起了群众的不满。比如我有一个七岁儿马舍不得用，硬套人家三岁马崽子驾辕，一下子给累爬了蛋。去年春旱，明明早种不好，互助组员都不愿意早种，但我硬叫大家先种我后种，后来我地里的庄稼长得比别人的好。今年春天雨水调和，适宜早种，互助组研究春种问题时，我就说，去年让你们先种，你们不愿意，今年我要先种。大家意见很多，可是不敢提出来。党教育我要处处为人民服务，可是我是处处为自己打算，占群众的便宜，就不像个共产党员。”最后董贵昌向党提出保证，一定要在党的教育下，在群众的监督下，改正自己的错误，要作一个好党员。经过对这一具体事例的批判，大家都认识到“富农的剥削思想和共产党员的共产主义思想是水火不相容的，党员剥削人，就是思想变了质”。最后，大家又进一步分析了产生富农思想的根源。有的党员说：“这是受旧富农的影响。”有的说：“这是受城市商人的影响。”经过领导上启发，许多人才认识到，除了这些影响之外，小农经济自发的资本主义因素是产生富农思想的根子。这样便使大家深刻地体会了党提出互助合作政策的意义。
    在这些思想问题解决后，绝大部分的党员感到轻松愉快，表示从今天起要走互助合作化的道路。西白土山村党员崔振生提出了“咱们回去后保证每个人要带领群众走互助合作的道路”。其他党员也都说：“回去非来个大转变不可。”
    在关于组织互助组的讨论中，工作组又发现某些党员对互助合作政策的认识是模糊的。有些人不懂得贯彻互助两利方针的意义，另有些人不懂得组织互助组的原则。根据这种情况，工作组就对大家进行了互助合作政策的教育，着重讲解了以下几点：（一）走互助合作道路是党在农村发展经济的基本政策。支部必须保证贯彻这一政策，党员必须参加并领导好互助合作运动。同时说清楚党内和党外是有区别的，党的社会政策允许富农存在，但不等于党内允许富农存在。（二）组织互助合作组织必须贯彻自愿两利、发展生产的原则。（三）选择互助组的典型例子，分析各种类型互助组的特点及其领导方法。（四）研究互助组和生产合作社不同的特点与要求，和成立农业生产合作社必须具备的条件。（五）说明了农村党员的领导与模范作用是开展互助合作运动的根本条件。在以上问题得到解决后，继续进行共产党员标准的八项条件的教育，并着重批判了某些党员的强迫命令、脱离群众的作风，以及个别的贪污勒索的恶劣行为。有些强迫命令作风应由上级负责的就由上级干部进行检讨。这样大家就自觉自愿地检讨了自己的强迫命令作风。被地主利用的党员，也检讨了自己失掉立场的思想和行为。
            （三）
    在经过党员标准教育之后，就进行登记、审查、处理工作。登记前，对党员进行了忠诚老实教育，讲清登记的意义。因为党员知道了如何才能作一个够标准的党员，所以在进行登记时，党员思想斗争很激烈。党员孙权就斗争了一天多才去登记。这时，工作组注意了解每个党员的思想情况，并根据不同思想情况分别进行教育。对于有决心当党员的向其说明只要决心改正错误，向共产党员标准的八项条件作实际努力，就可以登记作一个党员；对于一些本来没有决心作一个党员但怕不登记被人笑话的，就向其说明作一个党员是自觉自愿的，不登记，在党外同样可以作革命工作。经过两天时间，有五十名党员进行了登记，有五名未登记。结束登记时领导上又鼓励了登记的党员为争取作个完全够标准的党员而努力；对不登记的也进行了教育，安慰他们，并指出如果还有想登记的仍可请求登记。有个叫林长发的就要求登记。林长发以前所以没有登记，主要是因为他和三个妇女发生过不正当的关系，所以不敢登记。支部研究后，认为只要林长发认真改正自己的错误，仍可以作一个党员，支部就批准了林长发的要求。其他没有登记的人也表示以后要帮助党作好工作。
    登记后，以支部为单位进行鉴定，主要是使党员全面地正确地认识自己的思想品质、觉悟程度，并确定今后的奋斗方向。鉴定以后，即进行审查处理。在讨论具体人的处分时，大家开始有些偏激情绪，提出了过高的处分。经过对党的方针政策的学习和研究，他们就能根据中央所规定的“思想批判从严，组织处理从宽”的原则决定处分。例如对于东白土山村支部书记李子峰的处分，有的主张留党察看，有的主张撤销工作，有的主张给以警告处分。经过研究，一致认为，李子峰的错误主要是有强迫命令作风，本人已进行了深刻的检讨，并表示决心改正自己的错误，因此决定不给处分。对于某些问题尚未完全弄清楚的党员，为了慎重，决定弄清后再行处理。对于混入党内的阶级异己分子孔令发及蜕化变质分子蔡国志，大家一致同意开除他们的党籍。这些处分，最后还经县委批准。
            （四）
    审查和提出处理意见后，训练班即告结束，整党工作组的干部分别和党员一起回村进行民主补课。首先召开了两三次全村或全屯群众大会和村干部会，在这些会议上分别由干部向群众说明此次整党的经过及解决的问题。会后又搜集群众对于党员干部的意见。支部对这些意见作了慎重的研究，并定出处理的办法。支部决定凡有问题的，并且是群众意见较多的，均应由本人采用各种方式向群众进行检讨。这一工作进行得很好，许多群众在听了党员检讨后都很受感动。有的说：“共产党就是好，几天光景，就把这些党员教育得这样好。”党员和群众的关系得到了很大的改善。李子峰在大会检讨后，村里的群众都说支部书记真变好了，过去那能这样认错，并三三两两地去找李子峰谈心。个别怀有报复思想的人虽然对李子峰进行讽刺，但李子峰并不生气，只是耐心地给人解释。这时，工作组的干部向群众宣布整党处理结果，结束处理工作。然后又召开党员大会，总结支部工作，进行民主集中制的教育，改选支部委员，布置了目前工作。
    整党后，各村都呈现了一片新气象。首先是各村的互助合作运动在秋收中都有了进一步的发展。例如嘎气哈村，整党前只有五个常年互助组。整党后，由于党员觉悟的提高，积极带动群众互助合作，全村就组织了十七个常年互助组，八个季节性的互助组，两个临时互助组，现在只有十八户没有参加互助合作组织。这些互助组的生产工作都有了显著改进，使用新农具的计划也被提出来了。由于党员起了模范作用，群众在秋收中的劳动热情大大提高，因而缩短了秋收时间。从这一时期的工作情形来看，支部确已成为领导核心，许多群众都愿意参加党员所领导的互助组，并经常找党员谈话，解决各种问题。
