    All Areas Should Pay Attention to Leading Farmers in Snow Accumulation
    Comrade Editor: This winter has seen a lot of rain and snow, which is a major event directly related to next spring's production. However, much of the snow is blown into the gullies, and very little snow remains in the higher fields. To prevent drought next spring, it would be very beneficial for next year's spring plowing and sowing to take advantage of the snow this winter and plan to pile the snow in the fields. Therefore, after each heavy snowfall, all areas should immediately mobilize the masses to launch a snow accumulation campaign, and transport the snow from roofs, courtyards, streets, and ditches to the fields as much as possible. This will not only ensure the cleanliness and hygiene of the courtyards and streets, but also be more conducive to the development of agricultural production. Many places have recently had snow, and it is hoped that leading cadres in various regions will pay attention to leading the masses in carrying out snow accumulation campaigns.

    各地应注意领导农民积雪
    编辑同志：今冬雨雪很多，这是直接关系到明春生产的大事。但许多雪都被吹到山沟里去，较高处的田地里留下的雪很少。为了防止明春土地干旱，趁今冬有雪时，即有计划的将雪堆在田里，这对明年春耕播种是很有好处的。因此各地应在每次大雪之后，立即发动群众展开积雪运动，尽量把房上的、院里的、街道上的、路沟里的雪，统通运送到田里去。这样不但可以保证庭院街道的整洁卫生。更有利于发展农业生产。近来许多地方都下了雪，希望各地领导干部注意领导群众开展积雪运动。
