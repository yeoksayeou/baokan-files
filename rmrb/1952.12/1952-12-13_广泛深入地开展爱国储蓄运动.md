    Widely and Deeply Develop the Patriotic Savings Movement
    Our country will begin large-scale economic construction next year. In order to meet the needs of economic construction, sufficient funds are necessary. The state bank's carrying out savings work is one of the important methods of accumulating construction funds; the people's active saving is precisely a patriotic action to help the country accumulate construction funds. The state bank's development of savings work in rural areas, opening up sources of agricultural loan funds, can play a certain role in combating usury and supporting agricultural production.

    The conditions for carrying out people's savings work are now more numerous and better than in the past. Due to the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's living standards are gradually rising, and the people's savings capacity has increased. After the education of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the broad masses of people have a clearer and deeper understanding of the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and accumulating funds for economic construction. In the past, some city residents often deposited small amounts of money in private shops in exchange for higher interest rates, but now the majority of city residents have realized that this is an abnormal form of credit and are willing to deposit their money in state banks. Relying on these favorable conditions, and combining them with the central tasks of each period, most banks across the country have launched patriotic savings movements and have achieved great results. The total national savings in October this year increased by 42 percent compared to December last year. At the end of last year, there were 3.06 million households participating in savings (excluding prize-winning and fixed-amount savings); by the end of June this year, the number of savings households had increased to 14.44 million, an increase of 3.72 times. During this period, current monetary deposits increased by 2.5 times, fixed-term monetary deposits increased by 7.12 times, prize-winning savings increased by 13.25 times, and fixed-amount monetary savings increased by 25 times. The average storage time for deposits received by the Tianjin People's Bank in the first quarter of last year was 21 days, while in the same period this year it increased to 53 days; the average storage time for deposits received by the Shanghai People's Bank last year was 28 days, and this year it has increased to 57 days. The above facts show that our savings business is developing in the direction of long-term monetary savings. This is a good phenomenon.

    The People's Banks in various places have achieved considerable success in running savings businesses, but there are also many shortcomings. First of all, some bank cadres in certain regions do not pay enough attention to savings work. For example, the savings amounts in East China, North China, Central South, and Northwest China in October this year increased by 30 to 70 percent compared to December last year, but the Southwest region has remained stagnant at the level of December last year. After the banks in the Northeast region corrected the coercive and commanding style in savings work, cadres were hesitant and did not dare to take bold responsibility, resulting in this year's savings amount being lower than last year's. Secondly, some regions did not pay attention to publicity and explanation work in savings work, but adopted various coercive and commanding methods: some cadres implemented "fatigue meetings" to force farmers to acknowledge savings, and they would not adjourn the meeting if the farmers did not acknowledge savings; some adopted economic ranking, and assigned quotas rigidly according to land and yield; some rigidly issued fixed-amount deposit slips when farmers sold agricultural products; some used so-called "democratic appraisal" methods to force acknowledgement of savings. These erroneous coercive and commanding methods have created extremely bad effects among the masses. At present, the leading organs in some regions have issued instructions to correct these shortcomings, and have received certain effects, which is very necessary. In areas where corrections have not yet been made or are not thorough, effective measures must still be taken to resolutely and thoroughly correct them.

    In order to deeply and widely carry out the savings movement and prevent the occurrence of coercive and commanding styles, the following issues should be paid attention to in savings work in various places.

    First, banks at all levels should work with Party and government leading organs and people's organizations to deeply carry out savings publicity work. People's saving is a voluntary action, therefore, establishing the masses' correct understanding of savings work is the central key to implementing voluntary savings. Some regions pay great attention to savings publicity work. For example, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hebei Federation of Trade Unions, and the Communist Youth League and Women's Federation have all issued instructions on carrying out savings work, requiring all systems to vigorously assist banks in carrying out publicity and launching savings movements. Experience has shown that savings work is well developed in places where Party and government leading organs attach importance to it and strengthen savings publicity work. Governor Pei Lisheng of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government called for the launch of a patriotic savings movement at the first session of the Second Shanxi Provincial People's Congress. Taiyuan City then convened a savings mobilization meeting. In just half a month, the city's savings increased by 106.9 percent compared to before.

    Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research work to deeply understand the people's savings capacity. The People's Banks in various places should conduct systematic investigation and research on the local urban and rural economic development and changes in people's living conditions, so as to formulate savings plans based on the masses' savings capacity. If the masses' savings capacity is not investigated and savings figures are blindly allocated, compulsory savings will inevitably occur.

    Third, strengthen the enthusiasm of bank staff to serve the masses, educate cadres, simplify procedures, and facilitate mass storage. Savings work is meticulous mass work. Banks at all levels must proactively contact storage targets, solve mass difficulties, simplify procedures, and provide various conveniences to the masses. Banks at all levels should combine the purchasing work of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives to carry out deposit collection work; combine the masses' production and living loans to implement the method of whole borrowing and whole repayment, and zero deposit for repayment; focus on pilot projects such as issuing salaries and collecting tuition fees on behalf of agencies, groups, factories, and schools, set up business offices or mobile savings teams, and proactively absorb deposits; adjust business hours and simplify procedures to facilitate mass storage or withdrawal.

    Fourth, widely establish entrusted agency institutions to solve the difficulty of insufficient bank cadres. When entrusting agency institutions, select public and private enterprises with good credit, strength, and ability to carry out business, and sign contracts with them to mobilize them to handle business on behalf of them. In urban agencies, groups, schools, and enterprises with a large number of people, a "Savings Committee" can be established through the trade union organization (or organized in conjunction with the mutual assistance savings association of each unit). In units and residents' groups with a small number of people, active elements trusted by the masses can be hired as special savings business personnel. Leadership of financial teams in rural areas should be strengthened. In this way, the savings network will be spread throughout cities and villages, expanding the area for absorbing savings and facilitating mass savings.

### 广泛深入地开展爱国储蓄运动

    广泛深入地开展爱国储蓄运动
    我们国家将在明年开始进行大规模的经济建设。为了满足经济建设的需要，必须有充足的资金。国家银行开展储蓄工作，是积聚建设资金的重要方法之一；人民踊跃储蓄，正是帮助国家积聚建设资金的一种爱国行动。国家银行在农村开展储蓄工作，开辟农贷资金来源，这对打击高利贷，支持农业生产，都能起一定的作用。
    目前开展人民储蓄工作的条件，比起以往是更多更好了。由于工农业生产的恢复和发展，人民生活水平日渐上升，人民群众的储蓄能力增强了。经过“三反”“五反”运动的教育，广大人民对增产节约、积聚资金以进行经济建设的意义，认识得更加清楚、深刻了。过去一部分市民往往以零星款项存入私营商店，换取较高利息，现在广大市民已认识到这是一种不正常的信用，愿意将款项存入国家银行。全国各地大部分银行依靠这些有利条件，结合各个时期的中心工作任务，展开爱国储蓄运动，现已收到了很大成绩。今年十月全国储蓄总额较去年十二月增加了百分之四十二。去年年底全国参加储蓄的是三百零六万户（有奖、定额储蓄不包括在内），到今年六月底，储蓄户增加到一千四百四十四万户，即增加了三点七二倍。这一期间，货币活期存款增加了二点五倍，货币定期存款增加了七点一二倍，有奖储蓄增加了十三点二五倍，货币定额储蓄增加了二十五倍。天津市人民银行去年第一季度收到的存款，平均存储时间是二十一天，今年同期即增至五十三天；上海市人民银行去年收到的存款，存储时间平均是二十八天，今年已增至五十七天。上述事实说明我们的储蓄事业正向着货币长期储蓄方向发展。这是一种好现象。
    各地人民银行举办储蓄业务，成绩是不小的，缺点也是很多的。首先，某些地区的银行干部，还没有足够地重视储蓄工作。例如，华东、华北、中南、西北各区今年十月份的储蓄额，较去年十二月增加了百分之三十至七十，但西南区至今仍停滞在去年十二月的水平。东北区银行纠正储蓄工作中的强迫命令作风后，干部束手束脚，不敢大胆负责，以致今年的储蓄数额，反低于去年。其次，部分地区在储蓄工作中，不注意宣传解释工作，而采取了各种强迫命令的作法：有的干部为逼迫农民认储，实行“疲劳开会”，农民不认储，他就不散会；有的采用了经济排队，按土地、产量硬性摊派的办法；有的在农民出卖农产品时，硬性地搭发定额存单；有的以所谓“民主评议”的办法强迫认储。这些强迫命令的错误作法，在群众中造成极坏的影响。目前有些地区的领导机关已经发布了指示，纠正这些缺点，并已收到一定的效果，这是非常必要的。在尚未纠正或纠正不彻底的地区，仍须采取有效措施，坚决地、彻底地予以纠正。
    为了深入广泛地开展储蓄运动，防止强迫命令作风的发生，各地在储蓄工作中，应注意以下几个问题。
    第一，各级银行要结合党政领导机关和人民团体，深入展开储蓄宣传工作。人民进行储蓄，是一种自愿的行动，因此，树立群众对储蓄工作的正确认识，是贯彻自愿储蓄的中心关键。有些地区对于储蓄宣传工作是很注意的。例如，中共河北省委、河北总工会及青年团、妇联都发布了开展储蓄工作的指示，要求各系统大力协助银行进行宣传，开展节约储蓄运动。经验证明，凡党、政领导机关重视，加强了储蓄宣传工作的地方，储蓄工作就开展得好。山西省人民政府裴丽生主席在该省第二届第一次各界人民代表会议上号召开展爱国储蓄运动，太原市紧接着召开了储蓄动员大会，在短短的半月时间内，该市储蓄额就较前增加了百分之一百零六点九。
    其次，要加强调查研究工作，深入了解人民的储蓄能力。各地人民银行应对当地城乡经济发展情况及人民生活变化状况，进行系统的调查研究，以便根据群众的储蓄能力，制订储蓄计划。如不调查群众储蓄能力，盲目分配储蓄数字，势必造成强迫储蓄的现象。
    第三，加强银行工作人员为群众服务的积极性，教育干部，简化手续，便利群众存储。储蓄工作是细致的群众工作，各级银行必须主动地和存储对象进行联系，解决群众困难，简化手续，给群众以各种便利。各级银行应结合国营贸易公司、合作社的收购工作，展开收储工作；结合群众的生产与生活贷款，实行整借整还，零存备还的办法；在机关、团体、工厂、学校重点地试办代发薪金及代收学费业务，设置营业所或流动储蓄小组，主动地吸收存款；调整营业时间，简化手续，以便利群众存储或支取。
    第四，要广泛地建立委托代理机构，解决银行干部不足的困难。在委托代理机构时，要选择信用较好、有力量和能开展业务的公私企业，和它们订立合同，动员它们代为办理。在城市中人数较多的机关、团体、学校、企业单位内，可通过工会组织，成立“储蓄委员会”（或结合各单位互助储金会进行组织），在人数少的单位及居民小组内，可聘请为群众所信任的积极分子作为特约储蓄业务员。在农村应加强领导金融小组。这样，就使储蓄网散布到城市和乡村间，扩大了吸收储蓄的面积，便利群众储蓄。
