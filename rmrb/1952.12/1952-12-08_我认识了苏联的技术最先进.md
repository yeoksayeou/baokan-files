Li Xianyin, the technical director and engineer of the steelmaking department of Chongqing 102 Steel Plant, has been working in the factory for nine years. After entering the factory, he began to study the smelting of high-grade alloy steel. He had studied many kinds of British and American metallurgy and steelmaking books. However, the quality problem of high-grade alloy steel has never been solved. In 1946, American smelting "experts" Yue Kang (author of the book "Yue Kang Dephosphorization Method," which was popular for a time) and Stanford came to this factory to "help" smelt high-grade alloy steel. Li Xianyin had high hopes for these "experts," but he didn't learn anything from them. They didn't make a single good batch of steel out of five attempts. Despite this, Li Xianyin always believed that British and American technology was "the best in the world." He attributed the American "experts'" failure to make good steel to the poor quality of materials and problems with the furnace equipment in the factory.

After liberation, the 102 Steel Plant continued to be responsible for smelting high-grade alloy steel. From the second half of 1950 to July 1951, Li Xianyin and the steelmaking department's employees made great efforts to increase the chemical specification of the steel from 25 percent to 39 percent, but the steel's slag inclusion, sand inclusion, and shrinkage cavities were still very serious. Li Xianyin felt that steelmaking technology was really difficult and gradually became discouraged about solving the quality problem.

At this time, Soviet steelmaking expert Gimidov came to the 102 Steel Plant. Gimidov first asked Li Xianyin and some technicians and veteran workers about the past smelting situation, then carefully inspected the various steelmaking machines and collected the past smelting data. After studying the comprehensive materials, Gimidov said to the steelmaking department's employees: With the existing equipment, it is entirely possible to smelt high-grade alloy steel with good quality. The reason why it was not done well in the past was mainly due to problems in batching and technical operations. When Li Xianyin heard this, he felt excited on the one hand, but also somewhat skeptical. He thought, "The problem that authoritative American smelting experts have not solved, can Soviet experts really solve it?"

Gimidov first helped the steelmaking department's employees to smelt a difficult-to-smelt high-grade alloy steel - high-speed steel. He urged the testing department to precisely analyze the elemental composition of various steelmaking materials, and then配料 according to advanced methods. During the smelting period, he stayed by the furnace to guide the workers to operate according to the new technical operation method. When the workers encountered difficulties, he personally took action, doing and explaining at the same time. In this way, high-speed steel was quickly trial-produced successfully, and the quality fully met the specifications. Gimidov also often took time to give classes to technicians and workers separately, teaching many advanced steelmaking technical principles and operation methods. At this time, Li Xianyin saw Gimidov's successful smelting of high-speed steel, and he felt very admired. The idea of worshiping British and American technology began to shake in his mind.

In order to help the steelmaking department's employees be able to smelt other kinds of high-grade alloy steel after he left the factory, Gimidov spent several days formulating a set of practical and scientific technical operating procedures. Because Li Xianyin and most of the technicians in the steelmaking department had not completely eliminated the idea of worshiping British and American technology, and had not profoundly and comprehensively realized the superiority of advanced Soviet technical operations, therefore, when they began to implement the technical operating procedures formulated by Gimidov in January this year, doubts and concerns arose again. For example, according to the Soviet technical operating procedures: after the molten steel is released from the furnace, it should be calmed down for a certain period of time before pouring the steel. This allows impurities to float up, and the slag inclusion and sand inclusion in the cast steel ingot can be reduced. However, Li Xianyin and some technicians believed that British and American books clearly stipulated that the molten steel should be poured as soon as it comes out of the furnace. They were afraid that pouring the molten steel after calming it would result in short steel (a scrapped steel), so they refused to adopt the method of calming the molten steel. In addition, there were several operating procedures, such as the requirement to turn the carbide slag used to reduce the molten steel in the electric furnace into white slag (because white slag is lighter and easier to float on the molten steel, making the molten steel purer, and reducing slag inclusion and sand inclusion). Li Xianyin felt that he had never used it before and it was not easy to master, so it was safer to do it according to the old method. Because the technical operating procedures formulated by the Soviet experts were not conscientiously implemented, the quality problems of the steel in the steelmaking department were still not solved in the first quarter of this year. Several ordering units successively returned the substandard steel. A certain type of high-grade alloy steel ordered by a certain machinery factory alone was returned 60 percent, with a loss of about 2 billion yuan.

In order to change the above situation, the Southwest Industrial Department's Iron and Steel Administration repeatedly ordered the steelmaking department of the factory to implement the technical operating procedures set by the Soviet experts on a regular basis. The administration and trade union of the 102 Steel Plant also held a waste product exhibition in the steelmaking department, and focused on helping Li Xianyin and some technicians in the steelmaking department to examine the idea of blindly worshiping British and American technology, and criticize the erroneous idea of distrusting advanced Soviet experience. After these educations, Li Xianyin's political consciousness was raised, and he also had a new understanding of advanced Soviet technical operations. From then on, he carefully studied the technical operating procedures prescribed by the Soviet experts and the various technical principles taught, and organized technicians and workers to study advanced Soviet experience. During the period of implementing the technical operating procedures, Li Xianyin and the technicians went deep into the workshop and worked with the workers to study and solve new problems such as how to turn carbide slag into white slag. Practice has proved that every item in the technical operating procedures plays an important role in the quality of steel. For example, after implementing technical operations such as calming the molten steel and turning carbide slag into white slag, the slag inclusion and sand inclusion in the steel were greatly reduced. The chemical specification of the steel quickly increased to 99 percent, and the physical properties also increased to more than 80 percent. When the reporter interviewed Li Xianyin, he said excitedly: "Now I realize that only the Soviet Union has high industrial technology today, and at the same time, I now realize that only by humbly learning from the Soviet Union can our country's industrial construction advance rapidly!"

    我认识了苏联的技术最先进
    新华社记者　胡明俊
    重庆一零二钢铁厂炼钢部技术主任兼工程师李先银，在厂里工作已经九年了。进厂后他就研究冶炼高级合金钢。他曾经钻研过很多种英美的冶金、炼钢方面的书籍。但是，始终没有解决高级合金钢的质量问题。一九四六年，美国冶炼“专家”岳康
    （曾著岳康去磷法一书，流行一时）和斯丹福，曾经来这个厂“帮助”炼高级合金钢。李先银对这些“专家”抱过很大的希望，结果，他并没有从他们那里学到什么。他们连炼五炉钢，一炉也没炼好。虽然这样，李先银仍然一直相信英美技术是“世界第一”。他把美国“专家”没有炼好钢归咎于厂里的材料不好和炉子设备有问题。
    解放后，一零二厂仍然担负冶炼高级合金钢的任务。从一九五零年下半年到一九五一年七月，李先银和炼钢部职工费了很大的力量，才使钢的化学规格由百分之二十五提高到百分之三十九，钢的夹灰、夹沙和缩孔仍然很严重。李先银感到炼钢的技术实在艰难，逐渐对解决质量问题有些灰心。
    就在这个时候，苏联炼钢专家吉米多夫来到了一零二厂。吉米多夫首先向李先银和一些技术员、老工人询问过去的冶炼情况，接着详细检查了炼钢的各种机器，收集了过去的冶炼资料。综合各方面材料进行研究后，吉米多夫对炼钢部职工说：就现有的设备，完全可以炼出质量很好的高级合金钢，过去炼不好，主要是配料和技术操作上有问题。李先银听了这个话，一面感到兴奋，同时又还有些怀疑，他想：“美国权威的冶炼专家都没有解决的问题，难道苏联专家真能解决吗？”
    吉米多夫首先帮助炼钢部职工冶炼一种难于冶炼的高级合金钢——锋钢。他督促化验部门把各种炼钢材料的原素成分加以精确分析，再根据先进方法配料。冶炼期中，他守在炉子旁边指导工人按照新的技术操作法进行操作。工人们遇到困难，他就亲自动手，一边做，一边讲。锋钢就这样很快试炼成功了，质量完全合规格。吉米多夫还经常抽空分别给技术人员和工人上课，讲授许多先进的炼钢技术原理和操作法，这时，李先银看到吉米多夫冶炼锋钢成功，感到很钦佩，崇拜英美技术的思想在他脑子里开始动摇。
    吉米多夫为了帮助炼钢部职工在他离厂后能够冶炼另外几种高级合金钢，他费了好几天工夫制定了一套切合实际的科学的技术操作规程。由于李先银和炼钢部大部分技术人员还没有彻底肃清崇拜英美技术的思想，还没有深刻全面地认识到苏联先进技术操作的优越性，因之，在今年一月他们开始实行吉米多夫制定的技术操作规程时，又发生了怀疑和顾虑。如按苏联技术操作规程规定：钢水出炉后，要镇静一定时候再浇钢。这样可以使杂质浮起来，浇出的钢锭夹灰和夹沙就可以减少。但李先银和一部分技术员认为英美书上明白规定钢水一出炉就要浇，他们怕钢水镇静后会浇出矮子钢来（一种报废的钢），就不肯采用镇静钢水的办法。另外有几项操作规程，如规定要把电炉内钢水还原时所用的电石渣变为白渣（因白渣较轻，易于浮在钢水上面，使钢水更纯，夹灰、夹沙可以减少），李先银觉得从来没有用过，又不容易掌握，还是按老法做稳妥些。由于没有认真实行苏联专家所定的技术操作规程，今年第一季度炼钢部钢的质量问题仍然没有得到解决，曾有几个订货单位先后把不合规格的钢退了回来。只某机械厂订的一种高级合金钢，就退回来了百分之六十，损失在二十亿元左右。
    为了改变上述情况，西南工业部钢铁管理局曾一再责令该厂炼钢部定期贯彻实行苏联专家定的技术操作规程。一零二厂的行政和工会又在炼钢部举办了一个废品展览会，并着重帮助李先银和炼钢部一部分技术人员检查盲目崇拜英美技术的思想，批判不信任苏联先进经验的错误思想。经过这些教育，李先银的政治觉悟提高了，对苏联先进技术操作也有了新的认识。从此以后，他就仔细地钻研苏联专家规定的技术操作规程和讲授的各项技术原理，并组织技术人员和工人们学习苏联先进经验。在贯彻实行技术操作规程期中，李先银和技术人员都深入车间，和工人们一起研究解决如何变电石渣为白渣等新问题。实践证明，技术操作规程的每一项都对钢的质量问题起着重要作用。如执行镇静钢水和变电石渣为白渣等技术操作后，钢的夹灰夹沙就大为减少。钢的化学规格很快提高到百分之九十九，物理性能也提高到百分之八十以上。当记者访问李先银时，他兴奋地说：“现在我才认识了在今天只有苏联才有高度的工业技术，同时现在我才认识了只有虚心向苏联学习，我们国家的工业建设才能飞快地前进！”
