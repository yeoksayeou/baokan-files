Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th: The Soviet people warmly celebrated the 16th anniversary of the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution on December 5th. In the past few days, factories, institutions, and schools in Moscow and the Moscow region have held lectures, reports, and seminars, discussing the Stalin Constitution's guarantee of the rights of the Soviet people, the great friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the brilliant victories won by the Soviet working people under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party. Thousands upon thousands of Muscovites flocked to cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, and museums to visit festive exhibitions. Moscow's leading artists and amateur performing arts groups have held festive concerts these past few days.

The socialist emulation campaign launched by Soviet workers to welcome the festival has achieved great results. Countless reports of production successes continue to pour in. In the Moscow region, the team led by advanced worker Rybushkin of the Electric Steel Plant has produced more than 300 tons of steel according to the 1953 plan. About 500 female workers at the Kurov Textile Factory have completed their annual production plans. Advanced weaver Kosyreva completed this year's plan as early as October 18th, and she has overproduced 41,000 meters of textiles beyond the plan. At the same time, all the personnel of the factory have also achieved amazing results, saving enough cotton to produce one million meters of textiles. In Voronezh, several hundred Stakhanovite workers at the Excavator Manufacturing Plant have completed one to three annual production quotas. Many people have completed their five-year production tasks. The factory has completed three months ahead of schedule the orders for communist construction projects scheduled to be completed within a year. In Kazakhstan, the Kazakhstan Steel Plant has also completed its annual plan for the entire smelting process. The plant's rolling mill workers began production according to the 1953 plan more than two weeks ago. In addition, many enterprises in the Urals, Moldavia, and other union republics have also achieved remarkable achievements in the labor competition on the eve of the festival.

    苏联人民热烈庆祝斯大林宪法日
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民热烈庆祝十二月五日斯大林宪法颁布十六周年纪念。几天来，莫斯科市和莫斯科州各工厂、机关、学校都举行了演讲会、报告会和座谈会，谈述斯大林宪法对苏联人民权利的保障、苏联各族人民间的伟大友谊和苏联劳动人民在苏联共产党领导下所获得的辉煌胜利。成千上万的莫斯科人络绎不绝地前往各文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆和博物馆参观节日展览会。莫斯科第一流的艺术家和业余文艺工作团这几天都举行了节日音乐会。
    苏联工人们为迎接这个节日而展开的社会主义竞赛已获得巨大成果。无数生产方面的捷报源源不断地传来。在莫斯科州，电气钢铁工厂先进工人雷布希金所领导的工作队已按一九五三年的计划生产了三百多吨钢。库罗夫纺织工厂约有五百名女工完成了全年生产计划。先进织工科西列娃早在十月十八日就完成了今年计划，她已超过计划多生产了四万一千公尺纺织品。同时，该厂全体人员也获得了惊人成就，他们已节省了足够生产一百万公尺纺织品的棉花。在佛罗内兹，掘凿机制造厂有好几百个斯塔哈诺夫式工作者完成了一个到三个一年生产定额。许多人完成了他们五年的生产任务。该厂已提前三个月完成了规定要在一年内完成的共产主义建设工程的定货。在哈萨克，哈萨克钢铁工厂也已完成了整个冶炼过程的一年计划。该厂辗压机工人在两个多星期以前就开始按一九五三年计划进行生产了。此外，乌拉尔、摩尔达维亚以及其他加盟共和国的许多企业，也在节日前夕的劳动竞赛中获得了显著的成就。
