Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st. The second phase of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River officially commenced on November 14th. The Central-South Military and Administrative Committee has adjusted the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters, appointing Ren Shishun, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, as the General Commander, Li Hanruo, Deputy Commissioner of the Yichang Prefecture of Hubei Province, as the Deputy General Commander, and Yan Jun, Commissioner of the Jingzhou Prefecture, as the Political Commissar, to specifically lead the second phase of construction.

　　The Jingjiang levee reinforcement project, the Taipingkou flood diversion gate, the Huangshantou control gate and the dam, and the south line embankment of the flood diversion area, which are to be built in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, were all completed on June 20th this year.

　　The second phase of the project includes: (1) Reorganizing an existing 100-kilometer-long drainage canal (including a new-style drainage gate) within the flood diversion area, so that accumulated water in the flood diversion area can be discharged into the Hudu River through this canal, protecting crops in the flood diversion area from the threat of flooding.

　　(2) Repairing the embankments of the flood diversion area, including the reinforcement of the Taipingkou to Ouchikou section of the Jingjiang right bank levee, the repair of the eastern and western banks of the Hudu River, the slope protection of the Huangtian Lake new levee, and the stone protection of the northern bank of the Anxiang River and the eastern bank of the Hudu River, to ensure that the flood diversion area will not be threatened by the collapse of the Jingjiang, Hudu River, Anxiang River, etc. during normal times, and can safely store floodwater during flood diversion. (3) Repairing the embankments (enclosures) of twenty safe areas and building seven safe platforms (high ground) within the flood diversion area to protect the lives and property of 180,000 people in the flood diversion area during flood diversion. (4) Digging a drainage canal west of the Hudu River (outside the flood diversion area) to facilitate the drainage of accumulated water from farmland west of the Hudu River. (5) Destroying abandoned embankments and highlands in the flood diversion area and the beaches upstream and downstream of the flood diversion gate and control gate to avoid affecting the flood diversion volume during flood diversion. According to preliminary plans, the entire second phase of the project will require more than 15 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework. A total of 170,000 civilian laborers will be mobilized to participate in this phase of the project. In order to implement the policy of "both construction and production are not delayed," the construction period is more than two months, and the entire project is planned to be completed before the spring plowing next year. In addition, according to changes in the actual situation, the flood discharge gate in the flood diversion area, which was planned to be built when the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project began in the first half of the year, is no longer necessary and it has been decided not to build it.

    荆江分洪工程第二期工程开工
    【新华社武汉一日电】长江中游荆江分洪工程的第二期工程已于十一月十四日正式开工。中南军政委员会已调整了荆江分洪工程总指挥部，任命长江水利委员会副主任任士舜为总指挥，湖北省宜昌专署副专员李涵若为副总指挥，荆州专署专员阎钧为政治委员，具体领导第二期工程施工。
    荆江分洪工程中要修建的荆江大堤加固工程、太平口进洪闸、黄山头节制闸和拦河坝以及分洪区的南线围堤等工程，都已在今年六月二十日全部完成。
    第二期工程是：（一）在分洪区内就原有水系整理一条长达一百多公里的排水干渠（包括一座新式排水闸），使分洪区内的积水都能经过此渠排入虎渡河，保护分洪区内农作物不再受淹涝的威胁。
    （二）培修分洪区围堤，包括荆江右堤太平口到藕池口段的加培，虎渡河东堤、西堤的培修，黄天湖新堤的护坡，安乡河北堤、虎渡河东堤抛石护脚等工程，以保证分洪区平时不致遭受荆江、虎渡河、安乡河等溃堤的威胁，分洪时又能安全蓄洪。（三）在分洪区内培修二十个安全区的围堤（垸子），并修筑七个安全台（高地），以保障分洪期间分洪区内十八万人民生命财产的安全。（四）在虎渡河西（分洪区外）挖一条排水渠，以便利虎渡河西农田积水的排泄。（五）刨毁分洪区内废堤高地和进洪闸、节制闸的上游和下游的滩地，以免分洪时影响进洪量。据初步计划：整个第二期工程共需作土方、石方一千五百多万公方。共要动员十七万民工参加这期工程。为了贯彻“施工、生产两不误”的方针，施工时间为两个多月，整个工程计划在明年春耕前完成。另外，根据实际情况的变化，上半年荆江分洪工程开始计划时打算修建的分洪区的泄洪闸已无必要，决定不再修建。
