    Trade Unions at All Levels in Northeast China Have Vigorously Strengthened Trade Union Work in Basic Construction Over the Past Year

    Over the past year, trade union organizations at all levels in Northeast China, in accordance with the spirit of "placing basic construction in the primary position" decided by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, have vigorously strengthened trade union work in basic construction, which has greatly promoted economic construction and gained some experience.

    According to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions three times in 1951, requiring all provinces and cities to strengthen trade union work in basic construction. In October of that year, it also convened a joint meeting of chairmen of construction trade unions in major cities in Northeast China to study the special difficulties of trade union work in basic construction—trade union work on construction sites has to start from scratch every year, cadres have high mobility, and there are no backbones at the grassroots level, etc. The meeting decided to stabilize grassroots cadres and cultivate a large number of cadres and train activists before construction began in 1952 to make full preparations. After the meeting, trade unions in various provinces and cities overcame difficulties such as funding and dormitories, and trained 26,121 activists between the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952. The Northeast Trade Union Cadre School opened a training class for construction trade union cadres, focusing on training more than 850 grassroots cadres and advanced producers in basic construction. After graduation, some of these students served as engineering captains, group leaders, and party workers on construction sites, and most of them became the backbone of grassroots trade union organizations on construction sites throughout Northeast China this year. Relying on them, grassroots trade union organizations were quickly established and improved on various construction sites. The number of members among construction workers, which only accounted for 10% to 20% at the beginning of construction, has now generally increased to 50% to 70%. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, six major cities including Shenyang, Changchun, and Qiqihar transformed and purged more than 3,800 remaining disguised contractor elements, greatly raising the workers' awareness and enthusiasm. Trade unions in various provinces and cities have also gradually invested their main efforts in basic construction. The Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions established a basic construction office and transferred 118 cadres to strengthen construction trade union work. Construction trade unions in other major cities have also strengthened their backbones. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions established the Northeast Construction Trade Union Working Committee, and appointed the Secretary-General of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions to be specifically responsible for leading trade union work in basic construction. At the same time, three working groups were sent to Anshan, Harbin, and Changchun to study the establishment of trade union organizations, the promotion of advanced experience, wage quotas, propaganda and mobilization, life and welfare, security, and other issues, and gained some experience. For example, it was affirmed that the grassroots trade union organizations in basic construction should generally be based on construction sites. The best way to carry out propaganda and mobilization work is for the municipal federation of trade unions to cooperate with the city's literary and art departments to organize cultural service teams or propaganda teams to go to construction sites to show movies and dramas, compile quick talks and living newspapers based on on-site deeds and central tasks, pull foreign films, and establish mobile libraries to adapt to the characteristics of workers' intense labor and dispersed locations in basic construction.

    This year, trade unions at all levels in Northeast China have tightly grasped the link of promoting advanced experience in basic construction, which has played a significant role in accelerating basic construction. The scale of economic construction in Northeast China in 1952 was very large. Taking Anshan as an example, the planned workload in 1952 increased more than five times compared to 1951, and the planned installation value exceeded four times the actual completion in 1951; the total project volume in Harbin increased, but construction started two months later than in previous years. The common situation in various places is that not only do cadres lack experience, but also the technical level of workers is very low. To solve this contradiction and ensure "fast," "good," and "economical," it is necessary to vigorously promote advanced experience. This issue was emphasized at the Second Congress of Northeast Trade Unions in January this year. The later stage of the Northeast Trade Union Cadre School training class mainly focused on learning advanced experience, and trade unions in various provinces and cities also placed their main efforts on discovering, summarizing, and promoting advanced experience. Performance conferences were organized everywhere, and training classes were held to train team leaders and activists. In Harbin, Su Changyou's advanced bricklaying method was promoted in 80% of the bricklaying teams, and each worker could generally lay 1,600 bricks per day, exceeding the quota by 60%. Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line operation method has been promoted in all woodworking teams. The Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' basic construction office organized working groups to go deep into various construction sites from April to summarize advanced experience, and jointly held performance conferences and exhibitions with engineering companies to promote advanced experience. Then, various engineering companies held performance conferences and training classes for activists and team leaders to cultivate the backbone for promoting advanced experience. Up to now, Anshan has seen 24 major advanced experiences in foundation construction, civil engineering construction, mechanical installation engineering, electrical installation engineering, metal structure engineering, engineering design, and geological exploration. These advanced experiences have played a huge role in ensuring that basic construction is "fast," "good," and "economical." For example, the Wang Jinzhong concrete pouring engineering team created the concrete circulating assembly line operation method and slurry rolling method after learning from Soviet advanced experience, which increased efficiency by 166%, ensured first-class quality, and enabled the company's basic construction of foundations to be completed on time or ahead of schedule. The Zhang Jiaming team at construction site 0230 created an assembly line operation method for installing anchor bolt fixing frames, which ensured project quality. Construction site 0190 learned from this experience and increased efficiency by two times. Due to the promotion of Su Changyou and Xie Wanfu's advanced experience, Harbin's project progress was one-third to two-fifths faster. In order to comprehensively summarize these advanced experiences, the Northeast People's Government Industry Department and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions convened the Northeast Basic Construction Advanced Producers Representative Conference, which has now summarized more than 50 important experiences such as the promotion of the Su Changyou team's bricklaying method in the Harbin area and Anshan's pre-installation and parallel assembly line operation method.

    In addition, trade unions at all levels in Northeast China, under the leadership of the Party, cooperated with the administrative side to extensively launch a mass movement to establish a responsibility system, greatly improving workers' sense of ownership and responsibility; carried out red flag competitions, promoted the work of promoting advanced experience, accelerated project progress, and improved quality; and cooperated with the administrative side to improve the safety production and welfare work of workers on construction sites. Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, personally inspected the safety, welfare, and sanitation work of the grassroots committee at the Nanhu construction site in Shenyang. Based on the serious problems that generally exist in safety and welfare work, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued the "Circular on Strengthening Safety and Hygiene and Employee Welfare Work in Basic Construction" in August. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee instructed local party committees to lead party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres to discuss this circular, thereby promoting the improvement of safety and welfare work in various places.

    In order to welcome the larger-scale basic construction in 1953, trade unions at all levels in Northeast China decided to do three things well this winter: First, cultivate a large number of cadres and strengthen the winter study of construction workers; second, do a good job in the work of fixed workers and semi-fixed workers, and assist the government in solving the difficulties of seasonal workers' winter life; third, hold a conference of advanced workers in basic construction in Northeast China to exchange and summarize the advanced experiences of decisive significance in this year's basic construction, and determine the direction and plan for promotion next year.

    Over the past year, trade union work in basic construction in Northeast China has achieved great results, but in order to further strengthen this work, trade unions at all levels in Northeast China must do the following things well in the future: First, seriously and systematically summarize the experience of trade union work in basic construction over the past year, concentrate it to educate cadres, and make full preparations for carrying out trade union work next year; second, this year, the main strength of trade union leaders at all levels has been focused on summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of civil engineering and construction, while neglecting the summary and promotion of advanced experience in important departments in basic construction, such as coal mines, electric power, and smelting industries. This is a serious shortcoming and should be seriously improved; third, over the past year, Soviet experts have personally trained many technical personnel, workers, and management cadres, and taught many valuable advanced technologies to our workers, technical personnel, and management cadres. However, at present, these advanced technologies are only mastered by individual personnel. The trade union should assist the administrative side, through the employees who have already learned, to sort out and summarize these Soviet advanced technical experiences, and use them to train and cultivate more workers, technical personnel, and management cadres. Fourth, trade union cadres should be organized to study the theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge of basic construction, otherwise it will be impossible to truly go deep into the masses, go deep into the construction sites, strengthen specific leadership, and find out a set of experience in grassroots trade union work; fifth, this year, although the labor conditions, security work, and life and welfare work on construction sites have been improved to some extent, they are still far from the requirements. There is still a general phenomenon among trade union cadres that they do not care about workers' lives and safety. Therefore, summarizing this year's experiences and lessons in this regard, thinking of practical and feasible improvement methods, educating workers and cadres in winter training, and making advance plans for the preparation work for next year's construction are also very important tasks.

    东北各级工会
    一年来大力加强基本建设中的工会工作
    一年来，东北各级工会组织根据中共中央东北局所决定的“把基本建设放在首要地位”的精神，大力加强基本建设中的工会工作，对经济建设起了很大推动作用，并摸到了一些经验。
    根据中共中央东北局的指示，东北总工会在一九五一年曾三次发布指示，要求各省市加强基本建设中的工会工作。当年十月又召开了东北各主要城市的建筑工会主席联席会议，研究了基本建设中工会工作的特殊困难——工地的工会工作年年要从头做起，干部流动性大，基层没有骨干等等。会议确定使基层干部固定化，并在一九五二年开工前，大量培养干部和训练积极分子，做好充分的准备工作。会后，各省市工会克服了经费、宿舍等困难，在一九五一年冬和一九五二年春之间，训练了两万六千
    一百二十一名积极分子。东北工会干部学校开办了建筑工会干部训练班，集中训练了基本建设中的基层干部和先进生产者八百五十多人。这批学员毕业以后，一部分担任工程队长、组长和工地的党的工作，大部分则成为今年全东北各工地基层工会组织的骨干。依靠他们，各工地迅速地建立和健全了工会的基层组织。建筑工人中的会员人数，开工之初只占百分之十到二十，现在已普遍增加到百分之五十到七十。在“三反”和“五反”运动中，沈阳、长春、齐齐哈尔等六个主要城市改造和清洗了三千八百多名残存的变相的把头分子，大大提高了工人的觉悟与积极性。各省市工会也把主要力量，逐渐投入基本建设。鞍山市总工会成立了基本建设办事处，抽调了一百一十八名干部加强建筑工会工作。其他各主要城市的建筑工会也都充实了骨干。东北总工会则成立了东北建筑工会工作委员会，指定东北总工会的秘书长专门负责领导基本建设的工会工作，同时，派出了三个工作组，到鞍山、哈尔滨和长春研究工会组织的建立、先进经验的推广、工资定额、宣传鼓动、生活福利、保安等问题，取得了部分经验。如肯定了基本建设中的工会基层组织，一般的要以工地为单位。宣传鼓动工作的最好办法是由市总工会协同市内各文艺工作部门，组织文化服务队或宣传队，到工地去演电影、戏剧、结合现场的事迹和中心工作，编快板、活报、拉洋片，建立流动图书馆等，以适应基本建设中工人劳动紧张，地点分散的特点。
    东北各级工会今年在基本建设工作中紧紧抓住了推广先进经验这一环节，对于加速基本建设工作起了很大作用。一九五二年东北经济建设规模是很大的，以鞍山为例，一九五二年的计划工作总量比一九五一年提高了五倍多，计划安装的价值超过一九五一年实际完成的四倍以上；哈尔滨市工程总量增加了，可是开工却较往年拖延了两个月。而各地共同的情况是：不但干部缺乏经验，而且工人的技术水平很低。要解决这个矛盾，保证做到“又快”、“又好”、“又省”，就必须大力推广先进经验。今年一月间，东北工会第二届代表大会上强调了这个问题。东北工会干部学校训练班的后期主要是学习先进经验，各省市总工会也都以主要的力量，放在发现、总结和推广先进经验上。到处组织表演大会，开办训练班，训练班组长和积极分子。哈尔滨市在百分之八十的瓦工小组中推广了苏长有的先进砌砖法，每工一般可砌砖一千六百块，超过定额百分之六十。谢万福木工流水作业法则在全部木工小组中都推广了。鞍山市总工会基本建设办事处从四月份起，组织工作组深入各工地总结先进经验，和工程公司联合举办了推广先进经验表演大会和展览会。接着各工程公司又举办表演大会，开办积极分子和组长训练班，培养推广先进经验的骨干。到目前为止，鞍山在基础筑造、土木建筑工程、机械安装工程、电气安装工程、金属结构工程、工程设计、地质探钻等方面，已出现了主要先进经验二十四种。这些先进经验对保证基本建设做到“又快”“又好”
    “又省”起了巨大作用。譬如王进忠混凝土浇灌工程队学习苏联先进经验后创造的混凝土循环流水作业法和滚浆法，提高效率百分之一百六十六，保证工程达到一等质量，使全公司基本建设的基础筑造能够按期或提前完成。零二三零工地张甲明小组创造了安装地脚螺丝固定架的流水作业法，保证了工程质量，零一九零工地学习了这个经验，提高效率两倍。哈尔滨市由于推广了苏长有和谢万福的先进经验，使工程进度快了三分之一到五分之二。为了全面总结这些先进经验，东北人民政府工业部和东北总工会召开了全东北基本建设先进生产者代表会议，现已总结出哈尔滨地区推广苏长有小组砌砖法、鞍山的预安装和平行流水作业法等五十多种重要经验。
    此外，东北各级工会还在党的领导下，协同行政方面，广泛发动了群众性的建立责任制运动，大大提高了工人的主人翁责任心；开展了红旗竞赛，推动了推广先进经验工作，加快了工程进度，提高了质量；并协同行政方面改善了工地工人的安全生产和福利工作。东北总工会张维桢主席曾亲自检查了沈阳南湖工地基层委员会的安全、福利、卫生工作。根据安全福利工作中普遍存在的严重问题，东北总工会在八月间发出“关于加强基本建设中安全卫生与职工福利工作的通报”，中共中央东北局批示各地党委要领导党、行政、工会和青年团的干部讨论这一通报，从而推动各地改进了安全、福利工作。
    为了迎接一九五三年更大规模的基本建设，东北各级工会决定要在今年冬季办好三件事情，即：一，大量培养干部，加强建筑工人的冬季学习；二，做好固定工人和半固定工人的工作，并协助政府解决季节性工人冬季生活的困难问题；三、开好全东北基本建设先进工作者代表会议，交流和总结今年基本建设中有决定意义的先进经验，确定明年推广的方向和计划。
    一年来，东北基本建设中的工会工作获得了很大成绩，但是为了进一步加强这一工作，今后东北各级工会还必须做好这几件事：一、认真地、有系统地总结一年来基本建设中的工会工作经验，集中起来教育干部，为明年开展工会工作做好充分准备；二、今年各级工会领导上的主要力量多放在总结与推广土木建筑的先进经验方面，而放松了对基本建设中的重要部门，如煤矿、电业和冶炼工业中先进经验的总结和推广，这是一个严重缺点，应认真改进；三、一年来，苏联专家曾亲自培养了许多技术人员、工人和管理干部，把许多宝贵的先进技术，教给我们的工人、技术人员和管理干部。但目前这些先进技术只为个别人员所掌握。工会应该协助行政，通过已经学会了的职工，整理和总结这些苏联的先进技术经验，用以训练和培养更多的工人、技术人员和管理干部。四、应该组织工会干部进行基本建设的理论知识和实际知识的学习，否则就不可能真正深入群众，深入工地，加强具体领导，摸出一套基层工会工作的经验；五、今年工地的劳动条件、保安工作和生活福利工作，虽有了一些改进，但是距离要求还很远。工会干部中还普遍存在不关心工人生活与安全的现象。因此，总结今年在这方面的经验教训，想出切实可行的改进办法，对冬训中的工人和干部进行教育，对明年施工的准备工作进行事先的筹划，也是一件十分重要的工作。（陈浚）
