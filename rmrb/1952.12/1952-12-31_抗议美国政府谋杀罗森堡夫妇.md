    Protest Against the U.S. Government's Murder of the Rosenbergs
    The U.S. government, using fabricated charges, has decided to execute the peace-loving, kind, and innocent Julius Rosenberg and his wife by electrocution. This is a despicable murder, the culmination of the U.S. ruling clique's persecution of progressive people. We express our righteous solidarity with the wronged Rosenbergs and our resolute protest against the barbarous U.S. government.
    People all over the world know that the Rosenbergs are innocent, and the so-called "atomic espionage case" is entirely fabricated by the American reactionaries. The U.S. judicial authorities have falsely accused the Rosenbergs of being the masterminds behind stealing atomic bomb secrets and sentenced them to death, without any credible evidence. The American courts actually believe that political or social opinions are sufficient to constitute the crime of espionage, which violates basic legal principles. This verdict is not only unjust but, as pointed out by the American Civil Rights Congress, lacks even the appearance of legality. This shows that the American judicial organs have increasingly become a machine for the American rulers' insane killing.
    The U.S. ruling clique deliberately fabricated such a groundless injustice, and its sinister plot is very clear; it is a part of a despicable and filthy anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracy. First, the U.S. government attempts to deceive its domestic population through this case, maliciously slander the Soviet Union to incite anti-Soviet sentiment, pave the way for their plans to expand armaments, prepare for war, and further launch aggressive wars, and at the same time, cover up the bankruptcy of their atomic monopoly policy. On the other hand, the American rulers intend to use this to suppress the increasingly rising movement of the American people to fight for peace and democracy, to intimidate the increasingly awakened American people, and to make them believe that anyone who resists or is dissatisfied with the reactionary policies of the American ruling clique may face the possibility of being killed at any time. The case of framing the Rosenbergs is just one of the thousands of anti-people and anti-peace conspiracies of the U.S. government. It irrefutably proves that the United States is accelerating towards fascism, and in the United States, which has always flaunted democracy and freedom, not even a shadow of democracy and freedom can be found now.
    However, the shameful goals of the U.S. ruling clique cannot be achieved. Fabricated espionage cases and anti-Soviet propaganda will never make the American people believe that they are threatened by Soviet aggression; prisons and electric chairs cannot stifle the American people's call for peace and democracy. The U.S. government's framing of the Rosenbergs has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the American people, who are launching a movement to fight for the release of the Rosenbergs and the protection of human rights. The U.S. government must immediately revoke the illegal verdicts against the Rosenbergs, restore their freedom, and stop all barbaric atrocities that violate human justice and trample on human rights. Otherwise, they will never be able to escape the just judgment of the people of the world.

    抗议美国政府谋杀罗森堡夫妇
    美国政府以莫须有的罪名，决定要把爱好和平的善良无辜的朱利叶斯·罗森堡和他的妻子用电刑处死。这是一桩卑劣的谋杀，是美国统治集团迫害进步人民的登峰造极的罪行。我们对蒙受冤屈的罗森堡夫妇表示正义的声援，对野蛮的美国政府表示坚决的抗议。
    全世界人民都知道，罗森堡夫妇是无罪的，所谓“原子间谍案”完全是美国反动派凭空捏造出来的。美国司法当局把罗森堡夫妇诬陷为偷窃原子弹秘密的主谋犯，并判处死刑，是没有任何可以令人置信的证据的。美国的法院竟认为政治或社会见解便足以构成间谍的罪名，这是违反基本法律原则的。这种判决不仅是不公正的，而且正如美国民权保障大会所指出的，连表面的合法都没有。这说明美国的司法机关已日益沦为美国统治者疯狂杀人的机器。
    美国统治集团故意制造这样一件无中生有的冤狱，其罪恶图谋是十分明显的，它是卑鄙龌龊的反苏反共阴谋的一部分。首先，美国政府企图借此欺骗国内的人民，对苏联进行恶毒的诬蔑，以煽动反苏情绪，为他们扩军备战及进一步发动侵略战争的计划铺平道路，同时为其原子垄断政策的破产遮羞。另一方面，美国统治者打算以此镇压美国人民不断高涨的争取和平与民主的运动，恐吓日益觉醒的美国人民，要他们相信，谁若反抗或者不满美国统治集团的反动政策，便随时有招致杀身之祸的可能。诬害罗森堡夫妇的案件只是美国政府千百件反人民与反和平阴谋中的一件，它无可辩驳地证明，美国正在加速走向法西斯化，在一向标榜民主与自由的美国，现在连一点民主和自由的影子都找不到了。
    但是美国统治集团的可耻目的是不能够达到的。虚构的间谍案和反苏宣传，绝不能使美国人民相信他们是受着苏联侵略的威胁；监狱和电椅也不能窒息美国人民要求和平与民主的呼声。美国政府对罗森堡夫妇的陷害，已激起了广大美国人民的愤怒，他们正在展开争取释放罗森堡夫妇和保障人权的运动。美国政府必须立即撤销对罗森堡夫妇的非法判决，恢复他们的自由，并停止一切违反人类正义、蹂躏人权的野蛮暴行。否则他们就决不能逃避世界人民的正义的裁判。
