To the Editor:

    The leading cadres of the Henan Construction Company are neglecting the safety and welfare of the workers. At the Bisha Gang construction site in Zhengzhou City of the company, more than 400 workers are living in shacks that are drafty on all sides and leak when it rains. Whenever it rains, the workers have nowhere to sleep. The contract stipulates that the Henan Construction Company is responsible for the worker's sheds, cooking utensils, and tools, but more than 70 workers only have one pot, which is not enough. The original budget stipulated that 6,000 jin of scaffolding rope (rope used for scaffolding when building houses) should be issued to the construction site, but only 1,000 jin were issued. According to the contract, the workers requested the Henan Construction Company to repair the worker's sheds, increase cooking utensils, and issue more scaffolding rope. They made four requests, but none were resolved. The Henan Construction Company's reason is: "Streamline and economize, the higher authorities did not approve." I believe that streamlining and economizing should be carried out under the principle of not affecting the lives and health of the workers. If the workers' difficulties are not resolved, simply shouting about economizing will actually affect production and waste state property.

    I believe that the workers' demands are completely correct, and the company's attitude of indifference to the workers' demands is wrong. I hope that the leading cadres of the Henan Construction Company will quickly correct this erroneous attitude.

    河南省建筑公司领导干部应解决工人的安全福利问题
    编辑同志：河南省建筑公司领导干部忽视工人的安全福利工作。在该公司郑州市西北碧沙岗工地中，有四百多个工人住在四面透风、上面漏雨的席棚里。每逢下雨，工人们连睡觉的地方也没有。合同上规定工棚、炊具、工具均由河南省建筑公司负责，但七十多个工人只有一口锅，不够用。原预算规定发给工地六千斤架绳（建筑房屋时，搭架用的绳），但只发了一千斤。工人们根据合同，向河南省建筑公司要求修理工棚、增加炊具、多发架绳，要求了四次，都没有解决。河南省建筑公司的理由是：“精简节约，上级不批准。”我认为精简节约是在不影响工人生活和健康的原则下进行的。若不解决工人困难，单喊节约，实际上是影响了生产，浪费了国家资财。
    我认为工人们的要求是完全正确的，该公司对工人的要求采取漠不关心的态度是错误的。我希望河南省建筑公司领导干部迅速改正这一错误态度。
