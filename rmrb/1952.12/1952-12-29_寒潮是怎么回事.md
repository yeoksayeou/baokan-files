Answer to Reader Question:

    What is a Cold Wave?
    Question: Every winter, cold waves invade our country, affecting the lives of people in most parts of our country. What exactly is a cold wave? Please explain. (Zhang Qiang, Civil Affairs Section, Anqing Municipal People's Government)
    Answer: Cold waves can occur not only in winter, but also in spring, summer, and autumn; however, cold waves in winter are more intense and noticeable than in other seasons.
    China is one of the regions in the world most prone to cold waves. Cold waves in China mostly originate from the mid-northern part of the Eurasian continent and the Arctic Ocean. Due to the geographical environment and latitude conditions of those areas, cold waves are easily formed.
    The cause of a cold wave is a horizontally uniform air mass with roughly the same physical properties (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) (referred to as an "air mass" in meteorology). The air mass that stays over the mid-northern part of the Eurasian continent and the Arctic Ocean is such an air mass. The temperature of this air mass is very low, so its density is relatively high, and the air pressure it generates on the ground is also relatively high. When this air mass develops to a certain extent, it is affected by upper-air currents and begins to move southeastward. At this point, we say that a "cold wave has erupted."
    When a cold wave arrives, why does the weather suddenly turn bad? Because the cold air mass itself has low temperature and low humidity, the temperature drops suddenly, the air pressure rises sharply, the temperature decreases greatly, and the wind speed can increase to thirteen to twenty meters per second in the area its leading edge passes through. When this cold air mass moves southward and meets the local air, because the temperature, density, wind direction, and wind speed of these two types of air are inconsistent, a clear boundary is formed between them or at the leading edge of the cold air mass, which is usually called the "cold wave front." (Generally, the temperature is high, the humidity is high, and the wind speed is low before the front; the temperature is low, the humidity is low, and the wind speed is high behind the front.)
    Because China's terrain is complex, the speed of the "cold wave" front entering China is inconsistent. The path of cold waves entering China is also inconsistent. Some move from west to east, passing through North China and Northeast China before leaving the country; others move from northwest to southeast, passing through North China, Central China, and South China before leaving the country. Generally speaking, it takes about one or two days for a cold wave to sweep across our country from northwest to southeast.
    Cold waves have a great impact on agriculture, transportation, engineering construction, etc. Therefore, China's meteorological observatories attach great importance to cold wave forecasts. When a cold wave begins to move in its source region, its dynamics can be predicted; therefore, when it invades our country's borders, the meteorological observatory begins to issue news, clearly reporting the strength, direction, speed of the cold wave front, as well as the route it passes through, the current location it has reached, and even the weather changes it will cause. When we receive a report of an incoming cold wave, we can take timely precautions against the harm of the cold wave.

    寒潮是怎么回事
    问：每年冬季总有寒潮向我国侵袭，影响着我国大部地区的人民生活。寒潮究竟是怎么回事，请予解答。（安庆市人民政府民政科张强）
    答：寒潮不但在冬季，即使在春夏秋三季也有来的时候；不过，冬天的寒潮比较其他季节来得特别猛烈，特别引人注意。
    我国是世界上寒潮最盛行的地区。我国的寒潮大多是从欧亚大陆的中北部和北冰洋来的。因为那些地方的地理环境及纬度条件的缘故，很容易造成寒潮。
    寒潮的成因，是一种水平方向的物理性质（例如：温度、湿度等）大致均匀的空气团（在气象学上简称为“气团”，停留在欧亚大陆的中北部和北冰洋上空的，便是这种气团），这个气团的温度很低，因此密度比较大，在地面上产生的气压也就比较高。这种气团发展到相当程度，受了高空气流的影响，就开始向东南移动，这时候我们就说“寒潮爆发了”。
    当寒潮来临的时候，为什么天气会突然变坏呢？因为冷气团本身温度低、湿度小，所以它的前缘所经过的地方温度会突然下降，气压猛升，温度大减，风速可以加大到每秒钟十三到二十公尺。当这个冷气团南下，与当地的空气相遇以后，由于这两种空气的温度、密度、风向、风速都不一致，因此在它们中间或者在这冷气团的前缘就会造成一个显明的界限，通常称为“寒潮前锋”。（普通是锋前温度高、湿度大、风速小；锋后温度低、湿度小、风速大。）
    由于我国地形复杂，所以“寒潮”前锋进入中国以后，它的行速是不一致的。寒潮进入我国的行径也是不一致的，有的由西向东，经华北、东北而离开国境；有的由西北向东南，经过华北、华中、华南而后离开国境。大致说来，由西北向东南扫过我国，所需的时间约一、两天。
    寒潮对农业、交通、工程建设等等都有很大的影响，因此我国气象台对寒潮的预报是极为重视的。当寒潮在源地开始移动的时候，它的动态是可以设法预测的；所以到它侵袭我国国境时，气象台就开始发出消息，把这寒潮前锋的强、弱、走向、速度，以及它所经过的路线，现在到达的地点，甚至将要引起的天气变化等等都明确的报告出来。我们得到了寒潮袭来的报告，就可以及时地预防寒潮的危害了。
