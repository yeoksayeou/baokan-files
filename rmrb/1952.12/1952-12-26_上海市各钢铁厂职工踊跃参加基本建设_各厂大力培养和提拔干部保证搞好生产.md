Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private steel factories are actively transferring outstanding technical personnel to participate in basic construction work, while vigorously promoting and cultivating cadres to mobilize the masses to improve production.

[This newspaper reported] The East China Branch of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government held a cadre meeting on December 12th to mobilize technical personnel to participate in basic construction work. In the days since, over 80% of technical personnel and a large number of skilled workers from Shanghai's steel factories have enthusiastically responded. Currently, over 180 technical personnel have been approved by leadership to participate, and they will leave Shanghai for Beijing on January 3rd. The East China Branch of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government held a grand send-off ceremony on the 22nd to celebrate these honorable technical personnel participating in basic construction. The technical personnel participating in basic construction expressed immense satisfaction with the leap forward progress of the motherland and were full of confidence in their future work. Chen Guobao, an engineer from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 who is participating in basic construction, said at the meeting: "It is truly fulfilling to be alive in this great era. Before liberation, we technical personnel often felt like 'heroes with no place to use their skills'; one engineer couldn't find a way out and even hanged himself in Zhongshan Park. Today, we technical personnel only feel that our abilities are too limited to keep up with the development of the objective situation. But we believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, as long as we are willing to study and delve into our work, we will be able to overcome any difficulties in our new positions."

While workers are enthusiastically participating in basic construction work, the leadership of Shanghai's steel factories is accelerating another long-term plan – promoting and cultivating technical cadres. Xin Hu Steel Plant has already transferred four or five workers from the cold casting and pig iron workshops to take on technical management work. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 is drafting a cadre training plan for next year and plans to establish technical training classes. In addition to strengthening cadre training work, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 is also mobilizing the remaining workers to revise the Patriotic Pact and add individual pacts to ensure better production. The newly promoted cadres of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 have been seizing the time in recent days to learn from the technical personnel who are about to leave the factory to participate in basic construction. The technical personnel participating in basic construction are also actively teaching their production experience to them. For example, engineers Lu Jiren and Li Yongxi from the Mechanical and Electrical Department are introducing their work experience to the workers who will replace them and are telling them in detail about the key issues in production and the matters that should be paid attention to. Zhang Zongling, the head of the technical section, is very knowledgeable about silica bricks. When leaving the factory to participate in basic construction, he wrote down his years of research findings into written materials and handed them over to the worker who is taking over his position.

    上海市各钢铁厂职工踊跃参加基本建设
    各厂大力培养和提拔干部保证搞好生产
    【本报讯】上海市各国营、公私合营钢铁厂，积极抽调优秀技术人员参加基本建设工作，同时大力提拔和培养干部，发动群众把生产搞得更好。
    中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局华东分局在十二月十二日召开干部大会，动员技术人员参加基本建设工作。连日来，上海各钢铁厂已有百分之八十以上的技术人员和大批技术工人热烈响应。现已有技术人员一百八十余名经领导方面审核批准参加，他们将于明年一月三日离上海来北京。中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局华东分局于二十二日举行盛会，欢送这批光荣参加基本建设的技术人员。参加基本建设的技术人员对祖国飞跃的进步感到无限的欣慰，对未来的工作充满了信心。上海钢铁一厂参加基本建设的工程师陈国宝在会上说：“生长在这个伟大时代，真是心满意足。解放前，我们技术人员常感‘英雄无用武之地’；有个工程师找不到出路，竟到中山公园里上吊。今天呢，我们技术人员只觉得自己的本领太少，跟不上客观形势的发展。但我们相信，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，只要我们肯学习钻研，我们在新的岗位上一定能克服任何困难。”
    在职工们踊跃参加基本建设工作的同时，上海各钢铁厂领导方面已在加紧进行着另一个长远的计划——提拔和培养技术干部。新沪钢铁厂已在冷铸、马铁工场抽调了四、五个工人，担任技术管理工作。上海钢铁二厂正在订立明年的培养干部计划，准备创办技术训练班。上海钢铁一厂除加强培养干部工作外，并发动留下来的职工修订爱国公约，增订个人公约，保证把生产搞得更好。上海钢铁三厂新提拔起来的干部，连日来抓紧时间向行将离厂参加基本建设的技术人员学习。参加基本建设的技术人员，也正在积极地把自己的生产经验教给他们。如机电部的工程师陆济仁、李永熙，向留下来代替他们职务的职工介绍自己的工作经验，并把生产上的关键问题和应注意的事项，详细地告诉他们。技术科长张宗龄，对矽砖问题很有研究，这次在离厂参加基本建设时，把多年来研究的心得写成书面材料，交给接替他的职务的职工。
