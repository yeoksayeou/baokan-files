Xinhua News Agency, 5th — Just as the American government is refusing to immediately cease fire in Korea at the United Nations General Assembly, and insists on the unreasonable demand to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the war drums in Washington are beating louder and louder. Eisenhower has already taken off the mask of "ending the Korean War" that he wore to run for president; various plans and schemes to continue and expand the war are being heavily promoted, with the aim of stirring up war frenzy in order to pave the way for Eisenhower's war policy.

Of all these plans and schemes, the most insane and shameless is the plan of American Senator Bridges. He published his plan of "using Asians to fight Asians" in the "American Mercury" magazine. According to Agence France-Presse, the purpose of this plan is to use Asians to defeat "Asian communist military forces." Bridges proposed five methods, the main ones being: the United States must remain in Korea no matter what; the United States must not only arm South Koreans, but also arm all Asians who can be armed, such as Japanese, Chinese Nationalists, as well as Filipinos and Southeast Asians; impose a blockade on the Chinese coast; and allow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to participate in the Korean War and attack the Chinese mainland.

Bridges' "using Asians to fight Asians" plan exposes the American aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war and demonstrates the extreme hatred of American warmongers for the Asian people who have stood up, especially the Chinese people. This extremely insane plan of Bridges will undoubtedly be opposed by the vast majority of Asians, except for traitors like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee. Therefore, even the "boldest strategists" in the Republican Party cannot help but think that Bridges' goals are "just some distant, perhaps possible, events."

The American generals in the Pentagon who have tasted the iron fists of the Chinese and Korean People's forces are more aware of the times than Bridges. Agence France-Presse said that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff have presented Eisenhower with a "practical" view. They proposed taking the offensive, but at the same time explained "the various difficulties encountered in preparing for a counter-offensive under the existing conditions." One of the main difficulties is the lack of soldiers to fight. They said that in the United States itself, "there is only one division of wartime-organized troops," so "reinforcements cannot be sent immediately," and building the Syngman Rhee puppet army "will certainly take a long time."

In this contradictory situation, Agence France-Presse said that Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, has a "much bolder" suggestion, which is that "the Eighth Army can completely drive the communists out of North Korea at the cost of 50,000 casualties." A dispatch from Seoul by Agence France-Presse on the 1st also said that Eisenhower's first purpose in going to Korea was to "study whether it is militarily possible to launch a limited offensive in order to push the current front line about 150 kilometers to the north, so that the front line can be greatly shortened." It is said that in this way, the Syngman Rhee puppet army can be placed on the front line to block the attack, and the American army only needs to guard the rear. But the facts of the past have proved that Eisenhower's fantasies and Van Fleet's ambitions must be put to the test of reality, and then they will inevitably suffer even more. Van Fleet paid the price of 63,000 casualties in October, but not only could he not move forward, but he also had to withdraw the front line, otherwise the number of casualties would be even greater. The British "Times" on November 26th well described Van Fleet's disastrous defeat in the Kimhwa area. The "Times" said that dispatches from American journalists from Korea hinted: "The Chinese can continue this battle for as long as they want, and unless the Allied forces are prepared to gradually retreat their front line, they must constantly endure a high degree of death in order to avoid retreating, and see no hope of stopping this sacrifice. In fact, calling this situation a stalemate is not entirely accurate, because it is clear that the communists are not satisfied with keeping the front line in its current position, but are determined to push the Allied forces back."

From all these war cries, people can see how deeply mired in frantic despair the American aggressors who have been defeated in Korea are. Although they cannot come up with so much cannon fodder to carry out the war, in order to escape the shadow of the economic crisis, they must continue and expand the war, which will inevitably make more and more people see their bellicose face more and more clearly, thereby making them increasingly isolated.

    美国侵略者叫嚣“用亚洲人打亚洲人”
    证明在朝鲜吃了败仗的美国侵略者深陷在疯狂的绝望中
    【新华社五日讯】正当美国政府在联合国大会上拒绝立即在朝鲜停火，坚持强迫扣留战俘的无理要求的时候，华盛顿的战鼓敲得越来越响亮了。艾森豪威尔已经取下了他为了竞选总统而戴上的“结束朝鲜战争”的假面具；各种各样的继续和扩大战争的计划和方案正在被大肆宣传，其目的是要煽起战争的狂热，以便给艾森豪威尔的战争政策开辟道路。
    在所有这些计划和方案中，最疯狂和最无耻的要算美国参议员勃里奇的计划了。他在“美国信使”杂志上发表了他的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划。据法新社报道，这个计划的目的是要用亚洲人来打垮“亚洲共产主义军事力量”。勃里奇提出了五个办法，其中主要的是：美国不论如何都要留在朝鲜；美国不仅要武装南朝鲜人，而且要把亚洲所有可能武装的人，如日本人、中国国民党以及菲律宾人和东南亚人，也都武装起来；对中国沿海进行封锁；准许蒋介石匪帮参加朝鲜战争和进攻中国大陆。
    勃里奇的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划，暴露了美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋，说明了美国战争贩子们对于站起来了的亚洲人民、特别是中国人民的极端仇视。勃里奇这一个极度疯狂的计划，无疑将要遭到除了蒋介石、李承晚这一类卖国贼而外的绝大多数亚洲人的反对，因此，连共和党中“最大胆的战略家”也不能不认为勃里奇这些目标“只是一些遥远的或许可能发生的事”。
    五角大楼里的尝过朝中人民部队铁拳滋味的美国将军们，要比勃里奇识时务一些。法新社说，美国的三军参谋长曾经向艾森豪威尔提出了一种“实际”的看法。他们提议采取攻势，但同时说明了“在以现有条件准备反攻时所要遇到的种种困难”。这些困难中主要的一个就是没有打仗的兵。他们说，在美国本国“只有一师战时编制的军队”，因此“不能立刻派遣援军”，而建立李承晚伪军“当然需要很长的时间。”
    在这种矛盾的情况下，法新社说，美国第八军军长范佛里特倒有个“大胆得多”的建议，这就是“第八军可以用伤亡五万人的代价把共产党完全赶出北朝鲜”。法新社一日从汉城发出的消息又说，艾森豪威尔到朝鲜去的第一个目的是“研究在军事上是否有可能发动一次有限攻势，以便把现在的战线向北推进一百五十公里左右，而使战线大大缩短”。据说这样就可以把李承晚伪军放在第一线挡头阵，美国军队则只要在后面押阵就够了。但是过去的事实已经证明了艾森豪威尔的狂想和范佛里特的野心都要拿出来和现实碰头的，那么他们必然要吃到更大的苦头。范佛里特十月份付出了伤亡六万三千人的代价，结果不但不能推进一步，反而要把战线往后撤，否则伤亡的数字还要大得多。英国的
    “泰晤士报”在十一月二十六日很好地说明了范佛里特在金化地区惨败情形。“泰晤士报”说，美国记者从朝鲜发来的电讯暗示：“中国人这个战斗愿意继续多久就能够继续多久，并且除非联军准备逐渐后撤他们的战线，否则，为了避免后撤，他们就得不断忍受高度的死亡，并看不到这牺牲有停止的希望。实际上，称这种情况为僵局是不完全准确的，因为很明显，共产党并不满足于让战线维持在目前的位置上，而是决心要把联军向后推。”
    从所有这些战争叫嚣中，人们可以看到，在朝鲜吃了败仗的美国侵略者陷在多么深的疯狂的绝望之中。虽然他们拿不出那么多的炮灰来进行战争，但是，为了逃避经济危机的魔影，他们必须继续和扩大战争，这就必然使更多的人愈来愈看清他们的好战面目，从而使他们日益趋于孤立。
