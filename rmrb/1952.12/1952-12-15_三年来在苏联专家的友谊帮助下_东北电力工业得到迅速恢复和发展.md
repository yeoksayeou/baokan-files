With the friendly assistance of Soviet experts over the past three years, the Northeast power industry has increased its equipment capacity and utilization rate, successfully completed national production plans, fully supplied the power needs of industrial and mining enterprises in the entire Northeast region, and laid the foundation for large-scale industrial construction in the future.

Soviet experts have helped us in the recovery and production of the electrical industry with their outstanding socialist advanced technology. In 1950, a power plant had a large-capacity generator that had been abandoned, and many people thought it could not be repaired. After inspection and technical guidance by Soviet experts, it was quickly repaired. Its power generation can supply electricity for production and lighting in a medium-sized city. Another power plant had a generator whose output could only reach 60% of its original capacity due to internal problems. After being repaired with the help of Soviet experts, the output was increased to 94%.

Thanks to the suggestions and guidance of Soviet experts, the entire Northeast region began adjusting power loads and rationally and economically using electricity in 1951. As a result, the power grid increased its power by 110,000 kilowatts this year, which is equivalent to adding a large power plant sufficient to supply electricity to a largest city. In order to further increase equipment utilization, increase power generation, shorten power outage times, and increase factory production time, Northeast power enterprises, with the help of Soviet experts, implemented rapid maintenance of power generation and supply equipment. When a factory overhauled a boiler, the rapid maintenance method reduced the overhaul time by more than two-fifths compared to the past. After the main substation in Dalian City implemented the rapid maintenance method, the overhaul work was completed in four days, increasing efficiency by more than seven times.

Soviet experts also introduced the Soviet power plant's experience in generating electricity with low-quality coal. In 1951, when Northeast power plants began to test burning low-quality coal, power outages and fire accidents often occurred because the low-quality coal had low calorific value. Soviet experts personally helped several factories solve technical problems in combustion, enabling the use of low-quality coal for power generation, saving the country a lot of good coal. It is estimated that the entire region can save more than 400,000 tons of good coal this year.

In terms of enterprise management, Soviet experts have done their best to help us establish an economic accounting system for power enterprises. In 1950, they suggested that we reform production management and implement workshop economic accounting. In order to reduce our production costs, they constantly introduced the Soviet Union's advanced experience in reducing coal consumption, steam consumption, and plant power consumption. A Soviet turbine expert wrote a booklet entitled "Guide to Reducing Plant Power Consumption in Turbine Workshops" to improve our operation methods, and held turbine economic operation training classes to guide cadres and technicians in power plant workshops to further improve economic operation work.

Soviet experts have also helped us establish various regulations and organizations for safe power generation and supply. In 1949, because we had just started managing power enterprises, there were few engineering and technical personnel, leading cadres were not familiar with the production situation, and workers had low technical levels. Cadres and workers all had the idea that "a good machine is one that can generate electricity by piecing things together" and "broken machines and boilers are bound to have accidents." In 1949, the average equipment utilization rate of Northeast power enterprises was only one-fourth of the total equipment capacity, and more than 2,000 accidents, large and small, occurred in a year. Seeing this situation, Soviet experts immediately suggested that we strengthen technical security work, establish a special organization responsible for security work, introduced the Soviet power industry's rich experience in security work, and helped us establish more than 20 kinds of production regulations, maintenance operation regulations, and technical security regulations.

In the basic construction of power enterprises, the help given to us by Soviet experts has also played a significant role.

In 1950, Soviet experts suggested that we establish design institutions and teach us how to carry out survey and design work. In early 1951, the Soviet design expert team, in addition to completing the task of designing thermal power plants and hydroelectric power stations, also taught our design technicians a series of working methods such as drilling, surveying, and collecting data. In 1951, our technical personnel had been studying for half a year to design a metal coal storage tank without success. As soon as the Soviet design expert arrived, he told us several new calculation methods, and it was completed in just a few days.

With the help of Soviet experts, we successfully overcame many difficulties in the construction and installation work of basic construction. Taking the installation of generators in the Fuxin Power Plant as an example: When installing the boiler, according to the old method, hundreds of steel pipes, steel beams, and channel iron of different sizes and shapes had to be lifted one by one and moved to the scaffolds four or five stories high. We adopted the Soviet Union's advanced boiler main body segment assembly and installation method, dividing the steel pipes and steel beams into several large parts, assembling them on the ground first, and then lifting them piece by piece to the high scaffold and joining them together. As a result, installing a boiler saved 25,000 man-hours compared to the old method. The newly built turbine generator foundation project adopted the most advanced Soviet construction method—the one-time casting method. The large foundation of 500 cubic meters of concrete was completed in three days, shortening the construction time by four-fifths compared to the old method. In the Fuxin Power Plant project alone, we learned 16 important advanced construction methods. The generator installation project of the entire Fuxin Power Plant was completed one month ahead of schedule, reducing costs by 6 billion yuan, and the quality fully met Soviet advanced standards. This new machine officially generated electricity on September 21, receiving commendations from Chairman Mao and Comrade Gao Gang.

Whether in production or basic construction work, Soviet experts enthusiastically train our technical personnel, technicians, and management cadres. Wei Xingfa, the turbine specialist engineer of the Northeast Power Industry Bureau, was only a technician in the turbine workshop of a power plant three years ago. After being taught by Soviet experts, he can independently carry out the overhaul of turbines in a short period of time. A Soviet expert who installed generators in the Fuxin Power Plant said: "Installation is complete, but if cadres are not trained, the task is not considered complete." He suggested that we open a welding training class, and he personally compiled textbooks and taught classes. In the installation of the No. 1 boiler of the Fuxin Power Plant alone, Soviet experts trained more than 40 electric and fire welders who can work independently. Liu Jingfen and Yang Lihua were both ordinary female workers. After training in the welding training class, they were able to perform general welding operations. When installing the No. 1 boiler, the Soviet experts themselves did the high-pressure pipe welding or important places. When installing the No. 2 boiler, it was completely done by Chinese workers, and the quality also met the standards. (He Chunbo)

    三年来在苏联专家的友谊帮助下
    东北电力工业得到迅速恢复和发展
    三年来，东北电力工业在苏联专家的友谊帮助下，提高了设备能力和设备利用率，胜利完成了国家生产计划，充分供应了东北全区工矿企业的用电，并为今后大规模工业建设打下了基础。
    苏联专家曾以卓越的社会主义的先进技术，帮助我们进行了电业的恢复和生产工作。一九五○年，某发电厂有一台被废置的大容量发电机，许多人都认为不能修复。经过苏联专家的检查和技术指导，很快就把它修复了。它的发电力，可以供应一个中等城市的生产和照明用电。另一个发电厂的一台发电机，因内部有毛病，出力只能达到原来容量的百分之六十。经过苏联专家帮助修复，就把出力提高到百分之九十四。
    由于苏联专家的建议和指导，东北全区在一九五一年开始进行调整电力负荷和合理与节约用电工作。因而，今年电力网增加了十一万瓩的电力，等于增设了一座足够一个最大的城市用电的大发电厂。为了进一步提高设备利用率，增加发电出力，缩短停电时间，增加工厂生产时间，东北电力企业在苏联专家帮助下，对发电供电设备实行了快速检修。某厂检修锅炉时，使用快速检修法后，大修一部锅炉比过去检修时间缩短了五分之二以上。大连市的主要变电所施行快速检修法后，四天就完成了检修工作，提高效率七倍以上。
    苏联专家还介绍了苏联发电厂烧劣质煤发电的经验。一九五一年，东北各发电厂开始试烧劣质煤时，因为劣质煤发热量低，经常发生掉汽、跑火事故。苏联专家就亲自帮助几个厂解决燃烧上的技术问题，使完全用劣质煤发电，给国家节省了许多好煤。估计今年全区可以节省好煤四十万吨以上。
    在企业管理方面，苏联专家竭力帮助我们建立电力企业的经济核算制。在一九五○年，就建议我们改革生产管理，施行车间经济核算。为了降低我们的生产成本，不断地介绍苏联降低煤耗、汽耗及厂用电的先进经验。一位苏联透平机专家，为改善我们的运转方法，给我们写了一册“透平车间降低厂用电指南”，开办了透平经济运转训练班，教导各发电厂车间干部及技术人员进一步改进经济运转工作。
    苏联专家还帮助我们建立了各种安全发电供电的规程和机构。一九四九年，因为我们刚开始管理电力企业，工程技术人员很少，领导干部对生产情况不熟悉，工人技术水平低，干部和工人都存在着“能够凑付发电就是好机器”、“破机破炉，那能不出事故”的思想。一九四九年，东北电力企业的平均设备利用率只达全部设备容量的四分之一，一年内发生了大小事故两千多次。苏联专家看到这种情况，就立刻建议我们加强技术保安工作，成立专门负责保安工作的机构，介绍了苏联电业在保安工作上的丰富经验，帮助我们建立了二十多种生产规程、维护操作规程及技术保安规程。
    在电力企业的基本建设中，苏联专家给我们的帮助也起了很大作用。
    一九五○年，苏联专家就建议我们成立设计机构，并教我们进行勘察设计工作。一九五一年初，苏联设计专家小组，除完成设计火电站和水电站的任务外，并把钻探、勘察、收集资料等一系列工作方法，教给我们设计技术人员。一九五一年，为设计一个金属贮煤槽，我们技术人员曾研究了半年之久也未完成，苏联设计专家一来，告诉了我们几个新的计算方法，只用了几天工夫就完成了。
    基本建设的施工与安装工作，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们顺利地战胜了许多困难。以阜新发电厂安装发电机工程为例：安装锅炉的时候，照过去旧的方法，要把大小不同、形式不同的几百条钢管、钢梁、槽铁，一根一根地吊起来，一根一根地搬到四、五层楼房高的架子上去。我们采用了苏联先进的锅炉本体分段组合安装法，把钢管、钢梁分成几个大的部分，在地面先装好，然后一片一片吊到高架子上去并在一起，结果安装一部锅炉，比旧的方法节省了两万五千个人工。新建的透平发电机基础工程，自采用了苏联最先进的施工方法——一次浇制法，五百立方公尺混凝土的大基础，三天就完成了，比旧法缩短了施工时间五分之四。只在阜新发电厂这一个工程中，我们就学会了十六种重要的先进施工方法。整个阜新发电厂的发电机安装工程，提前一个月竣工，降低成本六十亿元，质量完全合乎苏联先进标准。这部新的机器，在九月二十一日正式发电，获得毛主席和高岗同志的嘉勉。
    苏联专家不论在生产和基本建设工作中，都热心地培养我们的技术人员、技工和管理干部。东北电业管理局的透平机专责工程师魏兴法，三年前还只是发电厂透平车间的技术工人，经苏联专家教导，短期间内就可以独立进行透平机的大修工作了。阜新发电厂安装发电机的一位苏联专家说：“安装完了，没有培养出干部不算完成任务。”建议我们开办一个焊接训练班，他亲自给编讲义、上课。仅在安装阜新发电厂一号锅炉中，苏联专家就给我们培养出了四十余名可以独立工作的电、火焊工。刘敬芬和杨丽华都是普通女工，经过焊接训练班训练，就能够作一般的焊接作业了。安装一号锅炉时，焊高压管或重要的地方都是苏联专家自己动手，安装第二号锅炉时，就完全由中国工人动手了，而且质量也合乎标准。        （何纯渤）
