In Linfen County, Shanxi Province, some rural grassroots organizations are seriously impure. Feudal landlords and counter-revolutionary remnants have directly or indirectly usurped the leadership of village-level governments, peasant associations, and the Communist Youth League, committing all kinds of evils. Three incidents of peasants being attacked and framed have occurred successively. The cadres handling these three cases in some districts, counties, and special districts not only failed to support the peasants and severely crack down on feudal landlords and counter-revolutionary elements, but instead listened to the one-sided statements of bad elements, arbitrarily detained and controlled the victims, and even personally presided over "struggle sessions," beating the victims to death. Some adopted a bureaucratic attitude of procrastination and perfunctoriness, causing the cases to remain unresolved for a long time, and the victims continued to be persecuted. The relevant party and government organs of the Central People's Government, Shanxi Province, and Linfen Special District have jointly sent people to investigate the basic situation of these three cases and have made serious and fair handling. In order to educate the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the masses through these three cases, and to further implement the anti-bureaucracy struggle, and in conjunction with carrying out the judicial reform movement, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government jointly convened a meeting on September 18th with 70 people including cadres, those involved, and responsible comrades from various departments, bureaus, banks, committees, offices, and institutes of the Provincial People's Government related to these three cases. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government also issued instructions requiring government organs at all levels to widely discuss these three cases and draw lessons from them.

The details of these three cases are as follows:

I. The Zhang Sanyuan Incident

Zhang Sanyuan was from Nanxi Village, District 1, Linfen, a middle peasant by class status, and a person of integrity. His son, Zhang Moqi, joined the People's Liberation Army in 1946 and died heroically in the Battle of Taiyuan in October 1948.

In 1949, during the land reform in Nanxi Village, Zhang Jinsheng, a ruffian and hooligan (who was a custodian of the peasant association and usurped the position of director of the peasant association in 1951), had a long-standing feud with Zhang Sanyuan and attempted to classify Zhang Sanyuan as a landlord. Ma Zijun, the cadre leading the land reform in the village at the time, also disliked Zhang Sanyuan because his marriage proposal to Zhang Sanyuan's daughter-in-law, Xi Zhenghua, was rejected. The two of them took advantage of their positions and arbitrarily classified Zhang Sanyuan as a landlord, repeatedly torturing him and confiscating his property.

In the winter of the same year, when dealing with the remaining issues in the land reform, Zhang Sanyuan was reclassified as a middle peasant through a mass meeting discussion, and necessary compensation was made.

In April 1951, during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Zhang Jinsheng, a ruffian and hooligan, fabricated lies such as "Zhang Sanyuan does not bow his head to the peasants, scolds cadres, demands old debts, and incites peasant disunity" and reported to the district, plotting to further frame Zhang Sanyuan. Jing Mingshan, the original secretary of the District Committee of District 1, Chen Baoqing, the deputy district chief, and others, without investigation, listened to Zhang Jinsheng's one-sided statement and sent Zhang Sanyuan to the county public security bureau on the charge of a landlord's counterattack.

In June, when the county was clearing accumulated cases, Jin Changgeng, the deputy procurator of the Provincial Procuratorate, discovered that there was an error in the case and pointed out: "Zhang Sanyuan is a middle peasant and a family member of a martyr, and should be apologized to and released immediately." However, Qin Guodong, the chief of the interrogation section of the Public Security Bureau, and Yang Shengjun, the director of the bureau, and others, because of ideological resistance, arbitrarily added the charge of being an unlawful element to Zhang Sanyuan and sentenced him to three months of control in the village.

After Zhang Sanyuan returned to the village, Zhang Jinsheng was determined to kill Zhang Sanyuan, so he fabricated materials for the second time and reported to the district that Zhang Sanyuan did not obey the control (actually, he was very law-abiding). At the beginning of October, when Jing Mingshan, the secretary of the district committee, came to work in the village, Zhang Jinsheng took the opportunity to instigate. Some villagers reflected the real situation to Jing Mingshan, but Jing Mingshan only listened to Zhang Jinsheng and did not consider it at all. He wrote the materials fabricated by Zhang Jinsheng into a draft and submitted it to the county "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" tabloid and the Shanxi Daily. After that, Chen Baoqing, the deputy district chief, and Chen Sishan, a cadre of the district committee, jointly decided to struggle against Zhang Sanyuan.

On November 6th, Chen Sishan came to the village to handle this matter, but did not go deep into the masses for investigation. He discussed with Zhang Jinsheng, Hao Jingshan (the village chief, who also had a grudge against Zhang Sanyuan), and Zhang Shenji, Zhang Xiaohou, and others who had private feuds with Zhang Sanyuan, on how to hold a mass meeting to struggle against Zhang Sanyuan. On the evening of the 7th, they convened a mass meeting in the name of calculating cotton accounts. At the meeting, Chen Sishan announced: "Zhang Sanyuan has not changed after education, and is now handed over to everyone for handling. Kill him if you want to kill him, shoot him if you want to shoot him." Then, under the instigation of Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Shenji, Zhang Xiaohou, Hao Youcai, Hao Deyuan, and others stepped forward and beat Zhang Sanyuan severely. Zhang Sanyuan died of serious injuries that night. After Zhang Sanyuan was beaten to death, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government instructed that the principal offenders should be severely punished, but the county people's court, under the control of the old legal concept of "injury resulting in death, no death penalty," gave the principal offenders Zhang Jinsheng and others a light sentence for a serious crime. Chen Sishan, the district cadre who presided over the struggle session and condoned Zhang Jinsheng and others to beat Zhang Sanyuan to death, was decided to be sentenced to imprisonment, but the county leaders shielded him and released Chen.

II. The Mi Gedou Incident

Mi Gedou is from Hongbao Village, District 5, Linfen, a middle peasant by class status, and is now thirty-eight years old. Mi Gedou's husband, Wang Dengtang's fifth uncle, Wang Pu, went to Shandong to do business more than 40 years ago and has not been heard from. All of the family property was originally managed by the fourth uncle, Wang Yu (a rich peasant). In 1940, under the auspices of Wang Pu's younger sister, it was decided that Wang Dengtang should inherit Wang Pu's property. Wang Yu's son, Wang Dengying, and others coveted the property and relied on the power of the puppet regime to seize the land, house foundation, and a piece of threshing ground that Wang Dengtang should have inherited.

After the liberation of Linfen, during the land reform from the winter of 1948 to the spring of 1949, Mi Gedou filed a complaint with the land reform work team. According to the land reform policy and the village cadres' discussion, the work team divided a piece of Wang Pu's original threshing ground to Mi Gedou and wrote a certificate. However, after the work team left, the village chief, Tai Kemin, and the security officer, Tai Yunshan (who were relatives of the rich peasant Wang Yu), seized the threshing ground back from Mi Gedou on the pretext of improper handling. Wu Xinai, the deputy district chief who was working in the village at the time, listened to the village cadres' words and tricked Mi Gedou out of the original certificate. At the same time, he announced to the village cadres: "Mi Gedou's inheritance has not materialized, and the property should be distributed to the public."

In the summer of 1949, when Mi Gedou was threshing wheat in the threshing ground, Wang Yuanxi, the grandson of the rich peasant Wang Yu, found the village chief Tai Kemin and the security officer Tai Yunshan to stop him, and illegally detained Mi Gedou in the village for four days before sending him to the district office. The secretary of the district office and Mi were from the same village, and knew that this was a revenge by cadres for personal gain, and released Mi.

In 1950, the deputy district chief Wu Xinai came to work in the village again, and Mi asked her to return the original certificate. Wu felt that it would damage her personal reputation, so she abused her power to arrest Mi and sent her to the district office for the second time. Later, the district office secretary still raised an objection and released him.

Mi repeatedly suffered oppression and could not bear it, so in February 1950, she filed a lawsuit with the county people's court. The county court had a serious yamen style, and was indifferent to the vital interests of the people. It took a procrastinating and perfunctory attitude. Mi filed a complaint three times in a row, but ignored it because there was no introduction from the district. Later, with the introduction of the Linfen Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the county court accepted Mi's complaint, but still treated it with bureaucracy and repeatedly delayed it. After Mi repeatedly urged, it finally hastily ruled that "the inheritance should be distributed to the peasants by the peasant association," and did not mention the mistakes of illegal detention of Mi by district and village cadres. Mi refused to accept it and appealed to the Linfen branch court. The bureaucracy of the branch court was also extremely serious. After Mi repeatedly urged for a judgment, it finally dismissed it with the words "the county has already ruled, and we don't care here." Mi had no choice but to travel a long distance to the Shanxi Provincial People's Government to file a complaint. The Provincial People's Government transferred it to the Provincial People's Court for handling. Ma Lin, the former president of the Provincial Court, advised Mi to return to the Linfen branch court for handling, and instructed Song Guangjiu, a judge of the Linfen branch court who was attending a meeting in the province at the time, to go back and seriously resolve the issue.

Mi Gedou returned from Taiyuan, but the Linfen branch court did not pay attention to it. Mi urged repeatedly, and it was delayed until October 3rd, when it ruled to uphold the original judgment of the county court. Mi refused to accept it and went to the Linfen Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China again. The prefectural committee transferred the judgment back to the Linfen branch court, but the branch court believed that Mi was making trouble unreasonably, put the judgment into the file, and never paid attention to it again.

In 1951, when Mi was still using the threshing ground to thresh wheat, the security officer Tai Yunshan came to stop him again and rudely knocked Mi Gedou to the ground.

The Mi Gedou incident has been delayed for four years. She has appealed to the people's governments at all levels in the district, county, special district, and province 35 times, and has suffered a lot of torture and embarrassment.

III. The Zhaijiazhuang Incident

The Zhaijiazhuang incident was an incident in which reactionary elements organized and planned to usurp the leadership of the village government, undermine peasant unity, counter-attack and settle accounts, and conspire to kill Duan Qiting, the head of the poor peasant group, Wang Wenfu, a standing committee member of the peasant association, and He Mingqi, an activist.

After the land reform in Zhaijiazhuang ended, peasants and cadres had the idea that the revolution had succeeded, and they devoted themselves to production and did not care about national affairs. The rich peasant elements Zhang Wenkui, He Yanlong, and others took advantage of the contradiction between local households and outsiders to collude with reactionary elements such as Gao Ruyue, Zhang Fu, He Yanying (He Yanlong's younger brother), and Gao Ruling to usurp the village government. Zhang Fu, who had worked in the Taiyuan County Public Security Bureau of the Yan bandit, served as the civil affairs commissioner. He Yanying, who was a member of the Yan bandit's Comrades Association and an enemy intelligence officer, served as the head of the Zhaijiazhuang troupe. Gao Ruyue, who was a member of the Yan bandit's Comrades Association, a clerk in the puppet Linfen County Government, and worked in the Hu bandit Zongnan's political work team, served as a volunteer teacher. Gao Ruling, who was the manager of the commissioned business of the puppet Kuomintang Linfen County Party Department, served as the vice chairman of the peasant association. Zhang Juncheng, the nephew of the rich peasant Zhang Wenkui, served as the Li head. After they took control of the village government, they further corrupted Xing Gaoji, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in the village, and Jing Mingshan, the secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Party of China. When Jing Mingshan came to work in the village in August 1951, he often ate and drank at Zhang Wenkui's and others' homes, and was completely surrounded by this group of counter-revolutionary elements and feudal remnants. Jing Mingshan and Zhang Fu, He Yanying, and others secretly discussed and passed a resolution through Xing Gaoji to convene a meeting of the Communist Youth League to take back the weapons kept by the peasants Xi Zhen and others and hand them over to Xing Gaoji and others. Then, they convened a mass meeting to "correct deviations." Under the threat of Jing Mingshan and under the manipulation of Zhang Fu and others, they announced the reclassification of rich peasant reactionary elements He Yanlong and Zhang Wenkui as middle peasants. Jing Mingshan also announced at the meeting the dismissal of Wang Mengjiu and He Mingqi (family members of soldiers, activists in the land reform) from their positions as volunteer teachers, and ordered the masses in the village to return the land, livestock, and cave dwellings confiscated from Zhang Wenkui during the land reform on the second day. Subsequently, He Yanying and others forced Duan Qiting, the head of the poor peasant group during the land reform, and others to vacate the cave dwellings in the rain, and they had to live in dilapidated cave dwellings on the mountain.

After the rich peasant reactionary elements Zhang Wenkui and others counter-attacked and settled accounts and recovered their property, they were not satisfied, and they also attempted to kill Duan Qiting, the head of the poor peasant group, Wang Wenfu, a standing committee member of the peasant association, and He Mingqi, an activist. They continued to incite the unity of local households and outsiders, and fabricated the crime of He Mingqi colluding with secret agents. Jing Mingshan, the secretary of the District Committee, sent He to the county public security bureau. The county public security bureau sent He back to the district because he had no reactionary facts. Jing Mingshan ignored discipline and convened a mass meeting in the village on the third day of the ninth lunar month, tied He and made him kneel in the meeting place, ordering him to confess his crimes. Zhang Fu and others instigated several people who had prejudices against He at the meeting to beat He. Finally, Jing Mingshan arbitrarily decided to place He under control for six months. They fabricated that Duan Qiting, the head of the poor peasant group, had undermined the Communist Youth League organization, convened a mass meeting in early October to struggle against him, and Zhang Fu and others illegally interrogated Duan Qiting for fifteen or sixteen consecutive nights, forcing Duan Qiting to formulate eight major control rules himself, placing him under indefinite control, and sending people to monitor his actions, plotting to torture him to death. After He Mingqi, Duan Qiting, and others were placed under control, Zhang Fu and others actively brewed and prepared to struggle against Wang Wenfu, a standing committee member of the peasant association, planning to beat Wang Wenfu to death. After that, Gao Ruyue and others continued to frame He Mingqi, fabricating that He Mingqi had three lives to his name and reported it to the county public security bureau. In January of this year, He was arrested again and detained for five months until he was released in June.

The feudal and counter-revolutionary remnants in Zhaijiazhuang were so rampant in their counter-attack against the peasants, but the leaders of the county had not noticed it because of serious bureaucracy. Moreover, although the victims Duan Qiting, Wang Wenfu, and others had repeatedly reported to the county chief and the organization minister of the county committee of the Communist Party of China, requesting immediate resolution, they still ignored it. It was not until this year when the central government sent people to Linfen to investigate the Zhang Sanyuan incident that Wang Wenfu and others came to file a complaint, and the central inspection team sent people to investigate and find out the truth of the incident.

After these three cases were exposed, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government attached great importance to them. After investigating the basic situation with the relevant agencies, they jointly convened a meeting of cadres and parties involved in these three cases. The meeting was presided over by Pei Lisheng, chairman of the Provincial People's Government, Wang Shiying and Deng Chumin, vice-chairmen, Tao Lujia, deputy secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Wei Heng, director of the organization department. According to the analysis of Pei Lisheng and Tao Lujia, the essence of these three cases is class struggle, reflecting that after the land reform in the late liberated areas, the feudal remnants and counter-revolutionary remnants have not been completely eliminated. Their claws have infiltrated some of our grassroots organizations, usurped power, used the problems left over from the land reform to provoke and sabotage, and at the same time tried every means to corrupt and lure our cadres. Chairman Pei Lisheng and others called for the resolute suppression of the landlord and feudal remnant forces and counter-revolutionary elements, the resolute removal of bad elements from within the revolution, and the overcoming of bureaucracy, lack of organization and discipline, and sectarian sentiments among cadres at all levels. During the meeting, the victims and their families, such as Mi Gedou, accused the landlords and bad elements of their counter-attack crimes and exposed the bureaucracy of the relevant agencies. The cadres who made mistakes also made self-criticisms at the meeting, apologized to the victims and their families on the spot, and asked the party and the people's government to punish them. Finally, Wei Heng, the director of the organization department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced the disciplinary actions of the party members who made mistakes, and Wang Shiying, the vice chairman of the Provincial People's Government, announced the administrative and legal sanctions against the relevant cadres and saboteurs and counter-attackers. A total of twenty-nine party members involved in these three cases were expelled from the party, one was placed on probation within the party, one was removed from work, three were publicly warned, and four were publicly advised. Four people were given administrative sanctions, including two who were demoted and two who were given demerits. Fifteen people were given criminal sanctions, including Zhang Jinsheng, the principal offender who beat the martyr's family member Zhang Sanyuan to death, who was sentenced to death, one who was sentenced to more than ten years of imprisonment, two who were sentenced to more than five years of imprisonment, and eleven who were sentenced to less than five years. The meeting also decided that Zhang Sanyuan's family should enjoy the treatment of a martyr's family, and the Provincial People's Government should allocate 500,000 yuan in compensation. In addition to the threshing ground originally divided to her by the land reform work team, Mi Gedou should be compensated for all the losses she suffered during the process of filing the complaint by the main perpetrator of the case. The land and houses divided to Duan Qiting and other poor peasants in Zhaijiazhuang during the land reform should be unconditionally owned by them.

    山西临汾县部分封建残余及反革命分子向农民进攻
    发生烈属张三元被打死等严重案件
    阴谋分子与失职干部现已受到人民法律的严正处理
    山西省临汾县的某些农村基层组织严重不纯，封建地主和反革命残余势力直接或间接篡夺了村级政权、农会及青年团的领导权，为非作恶，先后发生了三起农民被打击陷害的事件。处理这三个案件的某些区、县、专区的干部，不但不为农民撑腰，严厉打击封建地主和反革命分子，反而偏听坏分子的一面之词，擅自扣押、管制被害人，甚至亲自主持“斗争会”，将被害人毒打致死；有的采取了推拖敷衍的官僚主义态度，致使案件长期不能解决，受害人继续遭到迫害。中央人民政府、山西省及临汾专区有关党政机关现已共同派人调查清楚这三个案件的基本情况，并作了严肃公正的处理。中共山西省委和山西省人民政府为了通过这三个案件教育广大党员、干部和群众，进一步贯彻反官僚主义的斗争，并结合开展司法改革运动，特于九月十八日联合召开了与这三个案件有关的干部、当事人和省人民政府各厅、局、行、委、署、院的负责同志共七十人的会议。山西省人民政府还发布了指示，要求各级政权机关广泛讨论这三个案件，从其中吸取经验教训。
    这三个案件的经过情形如下：
    一、张三元事件
    张三元是临汾一区南席村人，中农成份，为人正派。他的儿子张磨祺于一九四六年参加人民解放军，一九四八年十月解放太原战役中光荣牺牲。
    一九四九年，南席村进行土地改革时，兵痞流氓张金生（为农会保管，一九五一年又窃据了农会主任职位）和张三元有宿怨，企图将张三元划为地主。当时在该村领导土地改革的工作干部马子俊，因向张三元儿媳席正花求婚未遂，也对张三元不满。他们两人便利用职权，擅自将张三元划为地主成份，一再非刑拷打，并将其财产没收。
    同年冬天，在处理土地改革中的遗留问题时，经群众大会讨论通过，改订张三元为中农成份，并作了必要的补偿。
    一九五一年四月镇压反革命运动时，兵痞流氓张金生又捏造“张三元不向农民低头，骂干部，讨旧债，挑拨农民团结”等谎言向区报告，阴谋进一步陷害张三元。一区原中共区委书记景明山、副区长陈宝庆等，不作调查，听信张金生一面之词，便以地主反攻罪名将张三元扣送县公安局。
    六月间该县清理积案时，省检察署金长庚副检察长发现此案有误，并指出：“张三元是中农成份，且系烈士家属，应即道歉释放”。但公安局审讯股长秦国栋和局长杨生俊等，因思想上有所抵触，又擅自给张三元加上不法分子的罪名，判处回村管制三个月。
    张三元回村后，张金生决心把张三元害死，便二次捏造材料，以张三元不服管制（实际很守规矩）为名向区上作了报告。十月初区委书记景明山到该村工作时，张金生又乘机进行鼓动。有些村民向景明山反映了真实情况，但景明山一味听信张金生，丝毫未加考虑，便把张金生所捏造的材料写成稿子，投到县抗美援朝小报和山西日报。之后，副区长陈宝庆和区委会干部陈思善等更共同决定斗争张三元。
    十一月六日，陈思善到村处理此事，也不深入群众进行调查，便和张金生、郝景山（村长，也和张三元有嫌隙）以及其他和张三元有私仇的张神记、张小猴等人研究如何开群众会斗争张三元。七日晚上便以算棉花账为名，召集群众开会。会上，陈思善宣布：“张三元经教育不改，现交给大家处理，要打死就打死，要枪毙就枪毙。”接着在张金生鼓动下，张神记、张小猴、郝有才、郝德元等上前毒打张三元。当晚张三元即因伤重身死。张三元被打死后，山西省人民政府曾指示严惩主犯，但该县人民法院在“打伤致死，不判死刑”等旧法观点支配下，将主犯张金生等重罪轻判。对主持斗争会并纵容张金生等打死张三元的区干部陈思善，决定判处徒刑，但该县领导上予以包庇，将陈释放。
    二、米圪斗事件
    米圪斗是临汾五区洪堡村人，中农成份，现年三十八岁。米圪斗的丈夫王登堂的五伯王璞去山东经商四十多年没有音讯，全部家产原由四伯王玉（富农）代管。一九四零年由王璞的胞妹主持，决定由王登堂承继王璞的产业。王玉的儿子王登瀛等贪图财产，便依仗伪政权势力，霸占了王登堂应承继的土地、房基和一块场面。
    临汾解放后，一九四八年冬到一九四九年春进行土地改革，米圪斗向土地改革工作团提出申诉，工作团根据土地改革政策和村干部议定，将原王璞的场面一块分给米圪斗，并写有证明书。但工作团走后，村长邰克明、治安员邰云山（和富农王玉有亲戚关系），便藉口处理不当，将场面从米圪斗手中夺回。当时在该村工作的副区长吴心爱，偏听了村干部的话，将米圪斗的证明字据骗出，同时向村干部宣布：“米圪斗继承未成事实，产业应归公分配。”
    一九四九年夏天米圪斗用场打麦，富农王玉的孙子王元喜便找村长邰克明、治安员邰云山前来阻挡，并将米圪斗私自在村扣押四天后送区公所。区公所秘书和米是同村人，知道这是干部徇私报复，将米放回。
    一九五零年副区长吴心爱又到该村工作，米向她索要原来的证明字据。吴感到有损个人体面，便滥用职权将米押起，二次送往区公所。后仍为区公所秘书提意见放回。
    米一再遭受欺压，忍无可忍，乃于一九五零年二月向县人民法院控诉。县法院存在着严重衙门作风，对人民切身利益漠不关心，抱着推拖敷衍的态度，米一连告状三次，都以没有区上介绍而置之不理。后经中共临汾地委介绍，县法院虽然受理了米的控诉，但仍以官僚主义对待，一再拖延，经米多次催促，最后却草率判决“遗产应归农会分给农民”，且对区、村干部非法扣押米的错误，丝毫未提。米不服，又上诉到临汾分院，分院官僚主义亦极严重，经米几次催判，最后却以“县已判决，这里不管”推出了之。米不得已，乃决意远道到山西省人民政府控诉，省人民政府转省人民法院处理。省法院前马林院长，劝米仍回临汾分院处理，并吩咐当时在省开会的临汾分院审判员宋光九回去认真解决。
    米圪斗从太原回去，临汾分院并未过问，米又多次催促，一直拖延到十月三日，又判决仍然维持县法院原判。米不服，再找中共临汾地委，地委将判决书转回临汾分院，分院却认为米是无理取闹，将判决书归卷，再未理会。
    一九五一年，米仍用场打麦，治安员邰云山又前来阻挡，并蛮横地将米圪斗打倒在地。
    米圪斗事件拖延四年之久，前后向我区、县、专、省各级人民政府申诉三十五次，受尽了不少的折磨和为难。
    三、翟家庄事件
    翟家庄事件是反动分子有组织、有计划地篡夺我村政领导权、破坏农民团结、反攻倒算、阴谋杀害贫农团长段其廷、农会常委王文富、积极分子贺鸣岐的事件。
    翟家庄土地改革结束以后，农民和干部产生了革命成功思想，埋头生产，不关心国家大事。该村富农分子张文奎、贺彦龙等便利用本地户与外来户的矛盾，乘机勾结高如岳、张富、贺彦瑛（贺彦龙弟）和高如龄等反动分子，窃据了村政权。曾在阎匪太谷县公安局工作过的张富任民政委员，曾是阎匪同志会会员兼敌情报员的贺彦瑛任翟家庄剧团团长，曾是阎匪同志会会员、伪临汾县政府科员并在胡匪宗南政工队工作过的高如岳任义务教员，曾任伪国民党临汾县党部委托商行经理的高如龄任农会副主席，富农张文奎之侄张俊成任闾长。他们把持了村政权以后，便进一步腐蚀青年团村支部书记邢高继和中共区委书记景明山等。一九五一年八月景明山到该村工作时，常在张文奎等家吃喝，完全被这一伙反革命分子和封建残余势力所包围。景明山和张富、贺彦瑛等密议，通过邢高继召开青年团会议，将农民席珍等所保管的武器收回，交给邢高继等掌握。接着便召开群众大会“纠偏”，在景明山的威胁之下，在张富等操纵之下，宣布改订富农反动分子贺彦龙、张文奎为中农成份。景明山并在大会上宣布撤销王梦九、贺鸣岐（军人家属、土地改革中的积极分子）的义务教员职务，并限该村群众在第二日将土地改革时没收张文奎的土地、牲口和窑洞退出。随后贺彦瑛等就威逼土地改革时的贫农团长段其廷等在雨天腾下窑洞，他们便只好住在山上的破窑洞里。
    富农反动分子张文奎等反攻倒算夺回财产后，并不满足，还企图把贫农团长段其廷、农会常委王文富和积极分子贺鸣岐等害死。他们继续挑拨本地户与外来户的团结，并捏造贺鸣岐与特务勾结的罪名，由区委书记景明山将贺押送县公安局。县公安局以贺并无反动事实，又送回区上。景明山竟目无纪律，于阴历九月三日到村召开群众大会，将贺绑跪会场，令其坦白认罪。张富等人在会上挑拨和贺有成见的数人打贺。最后，景明山擅自决定将贺管制六个月。他们捏造贫农团长段其廷破坏青年团组织，在十月初召开群众大会进行斗争，张富等人又一连十五、六夜非法审讯段其廷，威逼段其廷自订八大管制规则，把他无限期管制，并派人监视他的行动，阴谋将他折磨致死。贺鸣岐、段其廷等被管制后，张富等便积极酝酿准备斗争农会常委王文富，计划要将王文富打死。此后高如岳等又继续陷害贺鸣岐，捏造贺鸣岐有三条人命的血债，报告县公安局，于今年一月又将贺扣起，一直管押五个月之久，到六月才放回。
    翟家庄封建和反革命残余势力如此猖狂的向农民进行反攻，但该县领导方面因有严重官僚主义，一直没有发觉。而且虽经被害人段其廷、王文富等数次向县长和中共县委组织部长等反映，请求立即解决，但他们仍然不予理睬。直到今年中央派人到临汾调查张三元事件时，王文富等又来控诉，中央检查团才派人前去调查，弄清事件真象。
    这三个案件被揭露后，中共山西省委和山西省人民政府极为重视，在会同有关机关调查清楚基本情况后，便联合召开了与这三案有关的干部和当事人等的会议。会议由省人民政府主席裴丽生、副主席王世英、邓初民、中共山西省委副书记陶鲁笳和组织部长卫恒等主持。根据裴丽生和陶鲁笳的分析，这三个案件本质上都是阶级斗争，反映出晚解放区土地改革之后，封建残余和反革命残余还没有彻底肃清。他们的爪牙钻进了我们的某些基层组织，篡夺了政权，利用土地改革中遗留下来的问题，进行挑拨破坏，同时又千方百计地腐蚀和引诱我们的干部。裴丽生主席等号召把地主封建残余势力和反革命分子坚决镇压下去，坚决清除革命内部的坏分子，克服各级干部中的官僚主义、无组织无纪律现象和宗派情绪。在会议进行期间，受害人及其家属米圪斗等控诉了地主和坏分子的反攻罪行，揭露了有关机关的官僚主义。犯错误的干部也在会上作了检讨，当场向受害者及其家属道歉，并要求党和人民政府给他们以处分。最后中共山西省委组织部部长卫恒宣布了犯错误党员的党纪处分，省人民政府王世英副主席宣布了有关干部和破坏分子、反攻分子的行政处分和法律处分。总计与这三案有关的二十九个党员中，开除党籍的六人，留党察看的一人，撤消工作的一人，当众警告的三人，当众劝告的四人。受行政处分的四人，其中降职的二人，记过的二人。给予刑事处分的十五人，其中打死烈士家属张三元的主犯张金生判处死刑，其他判处十年以上徒刑的一人，五年以上徒刑的二人，五年以下的十一人。会议还决定张三元的家庭应享受烈属待遇，并由省人民政府拨给五十万元抚恤金。米圪斗除原土地改革工作团分给她的场地仍归她所有外，在控诉过程中所受的一切损失，由该案主谋犯予以补偿。翟家庄贫农段其廷等在土地改革中所分得的土地、房屋应无条件归他们所有。
