Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd dispatch from North Vietnam: The Vietnam People's Army continues to heavily strike the French aggressors in North Vietnam.

In Northwest Vietnam, the People's Army units that crossed the Black River have shattered the 270-kilometer-long defense line established by the invading French forces along the right bank of the Black River; with the exception of the isolated stronghold of Na San, the entire province of Son La has now been liberated.

On the Phu Tho front, the People's Army attacked two strongholds occupied by a French battalion, annihilating 220 French troops, killing the battalion commander, Berger, and capturing the battalion artillery commander, Gandu, alive.

In the Red River Delta, the People's Army continues to annihilate the French army's active forces in guerrilla warfare. On November 18th and 19th alone, the People's Army annihilated more than 90 French troops in Hung Yen Province and removed a French stronghold; in Thai Binh Province, more than 200 French troops were annihilated, and the garrison of a French stronghold was forced to surrender; in Nam Dinh Province, four platoons of French troops were annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: United Press International recently described the psychological state of the French colonialists after suffering a series of heavy blows from the Vietnam People's Army, saying: Even the most optimistic French "observers" do not hide their panic over the encirclement of Na San by the Vietnam People's Army.

Na San is the last stronghold of the invading French army in Son La Province, called the "Verdun" of Vietnam by the French authorities. Tens of thousands of French troops have been besieged in Na San. On November 28th, French Commander-in-Chief Salan and French front-line commander in North Vietnam, Linart, hurriedly flew to the Na San area with the puppet "Emperor" Bao Dai to plan a final struggle.

Just as the invading French troops were panicking about the encirclement of Na San, United Press International reported that the People's Army launched a "fierce offensive" on November 29th at another location – the southern edge of the Hanoi defense circle, the heart of the French army.

　　越南人民军在北越继续沉重打击法军
    山萝省内那岑被围的近万侵越法军恐慌异常
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军继续在北越沉重地打击法国侵略军。
    在越南西北部，渡过了黑水江的人民军部队已粉碎了侵越法军沿黑水江右岸建立的长二百七十公里的防线；除那岑一个孤立据点以外，现已解放了山萝省全省。
    在富寿前线，人民军袭击了法军一个营盘踞的据点两处，歼灭了法军二百二十人，击毙该营营长贝格尔，活捉该营炮兵指挥官甘都。
    在红河三角洲，人民军在游击战中继续歼灭法军有生力量。单在十一月十八日和十九日两天，人民军就在兴安省歼灭了法军九十多人，并拔除了法军据点一处；在太平省歼灭了法军二百多人，另迫使一处法军据点的守军全体投降；在南定省歼灭了法军四个排。
    【新华社三日讯】合众社最近叙述法国殖民者在受到了越南人民军一连串沉重打击之后的心理状态说：即使最乐观的法国“观察家”也不隐讳他们对越南人民军包围那岑一事所引起的惊慌。
    那岑是山萝省侵越法军最后的一个据点，被法国当局称为越南的“凡尔登”。数以万计的法军已在那岑被围。十一月二十八日，侵越法军总司令萨兰和北越前线法军指挥官李纳尔仓皇地带着傀儡“皇帝”保大飞到那岑地区，策划最后挣扎的办法。
    正当侵越法军在为那岑的被围而惶惶不安的时候，合众社消息说，人民军又于十一月二十九日在另一地点——法军的心腹地区河内防圈的南缘进行了“猛烈的进攻”。
