According to TASS: The Hungarian News Agency reports: The Budapest court opened a trial on November 15 against a group of terrorists who, under orders from the Yugoslav State Security Administration (Tito's secret police), came to Hungary to carry out espionage activities.

The defendants included the gang leader, Yugoslav Lazlo Balint, businessman Sandor Kenneres, major merchant George Balint, and other thugs.

Lazlo Balint and Sandor Kenneres had previously engaged in theft, extortion, and fraud in Hungary. The Tito gang took them in and made them work for the Yugoslav State Security Administration. Later, the head of the Yugoslav State Security Bureau ordered Balint to infiltrate Hungary, organize a spy network, and kidnap or assassinate Yugoslav political exiles. This terrorist gang had been trained and directed by senior officials of the Yugoslav State Security Administration. This group of thugs kidnapped a Yugoslav political exile in Budapest, chained him with iron chains, and sent him back to Yugoslavia. Balint received the rank of Major in the Yugoslav State Security Administration for this work.

The material evidence presented during the trial included an American rubber boat, an American Thompson submachine gun, pistols, grenades, gold coins, forged documents printed in Yugoslav printing houses, codes, handcuffs, etc. Lazlo Balint confessed that these handcuffs were all American-made and were shipped from the United States to Yugoslavia in large quantities.

From Lazlo Balint's confession, it can be seen that he had connections with the Yugoslav diplomatic mission in Budapest. Through this embassy, the Yugoslav State Security Administration was able to learn about the kidnapping of Yugoslav political exiles from Hungary. Then, the Yugoslav State Security Administration ordered the Yugoslav border authorities to assist the thugs in escaping across the border. The thugs were arrested while attempting to kidnap Paulis Verstoff Shek, a Yugoslav exile working as a journalist, from Budapest.

The court heard testimony from Paulis Verstoff Shek, whom the thugs had attempted to kidnap, and others.

The court interrogated the Yugoslav spy, former Hungarian People's Army member, defendant Bela Lavai. He accepted the order of Milanko, head of the Yugoslav State Security Administration, to infiltrate Hungary and organize several policemen and other counter-revolutionaries from the former Horthy regime into a terrorist spy group.

The trial ended on November 17.

The Budapest court heard the experts' verdicts, prosecutor Alapi's speech, and the defense lawyers' speeches. In their final statements, all the defendants admitted to all the crimes they had committed. Because the defendants engaged in espionage and terrorist activities, the court sentenced Lazlo Balint, Sandor Kenneres, George Balint, and Istvan Borbos to death, and Janos Borbos to life imprisonment. All of the defendants' property was confiscated.

The case of defendant Bela Lavai has been transferred to the military court for handling.

    拉兹洛·巴林特和桑多尔·肯尼雷斯两人过去曾在匈牙利从事盗窃、勒索和诈骗的勾当。铁托匪帮收容了他们，使他们为南斯拉夫国家保安处工作。后来，南斯拉夫国家保安局的头子命令巴林特潜入匈牙利，组织间谍网和绑架或暗杀南斯拉夫政治流亡者。这个恐怖的匪党曾受南斯拉夫国家保安处高级官员的训练与指导。这批匪徒在布达佩斯绑架了一位南斯拉夫政治流亡者，将他用铁炼锁住送回南斯拉夫。巴林特因为做了这个工作而得到南斯拉夫国家保安处的少校官阶。

    从拉兹洛·巴林特的供词就可以知道他和驻布达佩斯的南斯拉夫外交使馆有联系。通过这个公使馆，南斯拉夫国家保安处可以知道南斯拉夫政治流亡者从匈牙利被架走的消息。然后，南斯拉夫国家保安处就命令南斯拉夫边境当局协助匪徒们逃过边境。匪徒们是在企图将一个当新闻记者的南斯拉夫流亡者保利斯·维尔斯托夫雪克从布达佩斯架走时被捕的。

    法庭审问了南斯拉夫间谍，前匈牙利人民军人员、被告贝拉·拉伐伊。他接受了南斯拉夫国家保安处首脑密兰科的命令潜入匈牙利，把以前霍尔梯政权下的若干名警察及其他反革命分子组织成一个恐怖的间谍集团。
    十一月十七日，审讯结束。
    布达佩斯法院听取了专家们的判定，检察官阿拉皮的发言和辩护律师的发言。各被告在他们最后申辩中承认他们所犯的一切罪行。因为被告从事间谍和恐怖活动，法庭将拉兹洛·巴林特、桑多尔·肯尼雷斯、乔治·巴林特和伊斯万·柏波斯判处死刑，并将雅诺斯·柏波斯判处无期徒刑。被告的财产一律予以没收。
