　　The Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League, in order to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, opened a basic construction League cadre training class at the Northeast League School, drawing 120 League county committee secretaries and ministers, and League district committee secretaries and members from League organizations in various provinces and counties for training. After graduation, these students were uniformly assigned by the Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League on November 5 to work in basic construction departments in Anshan, Harbin, Fushun, Benxi, Qiqihar, Jilin, Changchun, Shenyang, and other places.
    This training class was very fruitful. In a short period of one month, the students recognized the primary position of basic construction in national construction and learned the principles and tasks of basic construction work, as well as the work of the League organization in basic construction. In order to enable the League organizations to better cooperate with relevant departments in carrying out work, the students also incidentally studied the work of organizations such as trade unions. At the beginning of the school year, more than 60% of the students were unwilling to do this work due to insufficient understanding of the great significance of basic construction. When the students graduated and the work was uniformly assigned, all the students happily accepted the organizational assignments and went to basic construction work posts.

　　青年团东北团校开办基本建设干部训练班
    青年团东北委员会为了适应大规模经济建设的需要，在东北团校开办了基本建设团干部训练班，从各省、县青年团组织中抽调来一百二十名团县委书记和部长、团区委书记和委员进行训练。这些学员结业后，已在十一月五日由青年团东北委员会统一分配到鞍山、哈尔滨、抚顺、本溪、齐齐哈尔、吉林、长春、沈阳等地基本建设部门工作。
    这期训练班的收获很大。在短短一个月时间内，学员们认识了基本建设在国家建设中的首要地位，学习了基本建设工作的方针、任务，以及团组织在基本建设中的工作。为了使团的组织更好地配合有关部门进行工作，学员们还附带研究了工会等组织的工作。开学时，曾有百分之六十以上的学员，因对基本建设的重大意义认识不足而不愿做这项工作。当学习结业统一分配工作时，全体学员都愉快地接受了组织分配，走向基本建设工作岗位。
