    Supporting the Japanese Working Class in Their Struggle for Living Rights

    The Japanese working class, in order to demand higher wages and oppose the cruel exploitation of American and Japanese monopoly capitalists, has launched a large-scale strike movement since the end of September. At the forefront of this strike movement are electrical industry workers and coal miners. 120,000 electrical industry workers have already held eleven power outage strikes. The general strike of 270,000 coal miners, which is indefinite, has persisted for more than forty days. Workers belonging to unions such as state-run railways, private railways, chemical industries, textile industries, seamen, teachers, and postal workers are also participating in this struggle for living rights. This is completely justified.

    It is well known that American and Japanese monopoly capitalists have implemented American-style "enterprise rationalization" policies, desperately increasing the labor intensity and working hours of Japanese workers. Coal miners, in particular, are forced to work more than twelve hours a day. Workers in munitions factories are even subjected to various forms of surveillance, as if they are in prison. However, the actual wages of workers are only 50% of what they were before the war, and the living conditions of Japanese workers are deteriorating. On the other hand, the profits of American and Japanese monopoly capitalists are soaring, and some companies can even distribute 80% dividends. The Japanese working class cannot tolerate this colonial slave life, and they have united to fight.

    In this strike struggle, the Japanese working class has once again demonstrated their unwavering will to oppose American and Japanese monopoly capitalists and the American and Japanese reactionary rulers, and demonstrated the inherent solidarity and tenacious fighting spirit of the working class. This strike by the Japanese working class is a demonstration against the re-emerged reactionary Yoshida government and against the American occupiers who are intensifying the exploitation and enslavement of the Japanese people and intensifying the restoration of Japanese militarism. Because Japan's economic lifeline and major industrial sectors are controlled by American and Japanese monopoly capitalists, most of which serve military production, especially coal and electricity have become the lever for Japan's industrial militarization. Therefore, this strike struggle is clearly a blow to the military production of American and Japanese monopoly capitalists and a blow to the war policy of American and Japanese reactionaries. Currently, more than 830 large factories across Japan have been forced to suspend production or reduce production due to power outages. Several of the largest coal mines in Honshu, Kyushu, and Hokkaido have been paralyzed, and coal production has been lost by more than 2.8 million tons. The number of train services nationwide has also been reduced.

    American and Japanese monopoly capitalists are still stubbornly refusing the Japanese working class's demand for higher wages, which is completely unreasonable. The reactionary Yoshida government and the American occupation authorities are preparing to undermine and suppress this strike movement of the Japanese working class. The supreme emperor of Japan - the American ambassador to Japan, Murphy, threatened to impose martial law if the "political situation does not improve." The Yoshida government is supporting factory owners in taking a tough stance against workers, not only refusing to increase wages but also demanding that workers "improve work efficiency." Countless facts have made the Japanese people realize that without fighting against the American and Japanese reactionaries, it is impossible to guarantee their living rights, and without winning independence, democracy, and peace, it is impossible to fundamentally improve their lives.

    The long-term and intermittent strike struggle of Japanese electrical industry workers and coal miners is not only for the economic interests of workers in the same industry but also for the living rights of the entire working class. This struggle will also have a profound political impact in Japan. Therefore, the Japanese working class will strive to support the electrical industry workers and coal miners who are heroically persisting in their strike. The Japanese working class will promote the great spirit of unity, defeat the divisive conspiracies of scab elements, help electrical industry workers and coal miners overcome their temporary difficulties in life, and strive for the victory of the strike.

    The Chinese people are deeply concerned about the living conditions of Japanese workers, and we firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese working class for living rights, and we believe that this strike struggle will strengthen the overall struggle of the Japanese people for independence, democracy, and peace.

    支持日本工人阶级争取生活权利的斗争
    日本工人阶级为了要求提高工资，反对美、日独占资本家的残酷剥削，从九月底开始，展开了大规模的罢工运动。站在这次罢工运动最前列的是电气产业工人和煤矿工人。十二万电气产业工人已经举行了十一次停电罢工。二十七万煤矿工人所举行的无一定期限的总罢工，迄今已经坚持四十多天了。属于国营铁道、私营铁道、化学工业、纺织工业、海员、教师、递信从业员等工会的工人，也参加这一争取生活权利的斗争。这是完全正当的。
    人们都知道，美、日独占资本家实行了美国式的“企业合理化”政策，拚命地提高日本工人的劳动强度和增加工作时间。特别是煤矿工人，他们每天被迫要做十二小时以上的工作。在军火工厂工作的工人更受到种种监视，有如坐牢。但是工人的实际工资仅及战前的百分之五十，日本工人的生活条件越来越恶化了。另一方面，美、日独占资本家的利润却在激增，有的公司甚至可以分到百分之八十的花红。日本工人阶级不能容忍这种殖民地的奴隶生活，他们团结起来进行了斗争。
    日本工人阶级在这一罢工斗争中再次表现出他们反对美、日独占资本家，反对美、日反动统治者的不可动摇的意志，表现出工人阶级所固有的团结性和坚韧的斗争精神。日本工人阶级的这次罢工是对重新上台的吉田反动政府的一个示威，是对加紧剥削和奴役日本人民、加紧恢复日本军国主义的美国占领者的一个示威。由于日本的经济命脉和主要产业部门都控制在美、日独占资本家手中，其中大部分都为军事生产服务，特别是煤和电力已成为日本工业军事化的杠杆，所以这次的罢工斗争，显然是对美、日独占资本家的军事生产的一个打击，是对美、日反动派的战争政策的一个打击。目前日本全国八百三十余家大工厂都因停电而被迫停工减产。本州、九州和北海道的几个最大煤矿都陷于瘫痪状态，煤产量已损失二百八十万吨以上。全国的火车班次也减少了。
    美、日独占资本家现在仍然一味拒绝日本工人阶级所提出的提高工资的要求，这是完全无理的。吉田反动政府和美国占领当局，正准备破坏和镇压日本工人阶级的这次罢工运动。日本的太上皇——美国驻日大使墨菲扬言如果“政治局势不能好转”，就要下戒严令。吉田政府正支持工厂主对工人采取强硬态度，不仅拒绝增加工资，反而要工人“提高工作效率”。无数的事实使日本人民认识到，不和美、日反动派进行斗争，就不可能保障自己的生活权利，不争得独立、民主与和平，就不可能根本地改善自己的生活。
    日本电气产业工人和煤矿工人的长期的和断续的罢工斗争，不仅为了同业工人的经济利益，而且是为了争取整个工人阶级的生活权利。这一斗争也将在日本发生深刻的政治影响。因此日本工人阶级将努力支援英勇坚持罢工的电气产业工人和煤矿工人。日本工人阶级将发扬伟大的团结精神，击败工贼分子的分化阴谋，帮助电气产业工人和煤矿工人克服他们生活上的暂时困难，争取罢工的胜利。
    中国人民深切关怀日本工人的生活处境，我们坚决支持日本工人阶级这一争取生活权利的正义斗争，并相信这次的罢工斗争将加强日本人民争取独立、民主与和平的总的斗争。
