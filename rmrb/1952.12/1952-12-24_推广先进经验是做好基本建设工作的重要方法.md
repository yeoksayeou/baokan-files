Promoting Advanced Experience is an Important Method for Doing a Good Job in Basic Construction
Ye Zhiqiang

Our country's large-scale economic construction is about to begin. For us, the basic construction work in the future will be a hundred times more arduous than the work during the period of production recovery. Many of the factories and mines we are going to build are designed and constructed according to the most advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union. The scale and technical complexity of these new types of factories and mines are unprecedented. And these large-scale projects are only allowed to be done well, not badly. We must guarantee quality, guarantee completion on time, and strive to save investment for the country. How can we do basic construction work "well," "quickly," and "economically" with extremely weak forces and a lack of experience? One of the important methods is to vigorously promote advanced experience.

Recently, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a representative conference of advanced producers in basic construction, which initially exchanged and summarized advanced experiences in various aspects.

The Northeast region has only been focusing on basic construction for one year. In this short year, the employees of various basic construction units, under the leadership of the Party and governments at all levels, and with the selfless help of Soviet experts, have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and humbly learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. They have begun to gain experience in all aspects of basic construction. This experience is our country's most precious and valuable wealth. Being good at learning and continuing to improve and enrich this advanced experience will enable us to complete the basic construction work next year very well. For example, in the mechanical installation engineering of heavy industry construction: under the guidance of Soviet experts, the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Fuxin Engineering Team of the Northeast Thermal Power Engineering Company have learned the "pre-assembly" installation method, and at the same time, they have made good creations in installing anchor bolts and electric welding. The emergence of these advanced experiences enables our heavy industry's basic construction to reach the most advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union, even in the case of insufficient experience and a low level of technology. It also greatly shortens the construction period, reduces costs, and ensures the safety of employees. Many key projects in the Northeast have learned from this advanced experience and have achieved good results. Another example is in mine construction: in the past, shaft sinking used the backward single-operation method of capitalist countries. It generally took six or seven years, or even more than ten years, to build a pair of large-scale shafts. In this way, the speed of the development of my country's coal industry cannot meet the requirements of large-scale economic construction. In the process of constructing the central shaft, the Xi'an Mining Bureau accepted the suggestion of Soviet experts, abandoned the backward single-operation method of capitalist countries and adopted the parallel operation method. In addition, the invention teams made creations in rock drilling, completing the shaft construction task in twenty months, which was twenty-two months ahead of the country's original plan; it can be completed five years earlier than using the old method. Ma Wenzhi's drilling team from Fuxin Mining Bureau and Yang Chunfa from the Northeast Nonferrous Metal Administration learned from Soviet experience and created rapid drilling methods and one-time grit feeding methods, which greatly increased the drilling speed and ensured the quality of the core. Eighty percent of the drilling teams of Fuxin Mining Bureau promoted the advanced experience of Ma Wenzhi's team and completed the national task one quarter ahead of schedule. The rapid drilling experience of Ma Wenzhi and Yang Chunfa will play a great role in changing the current situation that drilling work cannot keep up with design work. Another example is in civil construction: from construction management to operation technology, labor organization, and tool improvement, many advanced experiences have emerged. The emergence of these advanced experiences has brought about major innovations in housing construction projects. Su Changyou's double-handed mortar extrusion method has brought about a fundamental reform in the bricklaying work of bricklayers. All groups that have seriously learned Su Changyou's double-handed mortar extrusion method have changed the past situation of low quality and slow progress. After learning the double-handed mortar extrusion method, many groups have improved the quality from about 80% to more than 90%, and some have reached 100%, and they can all break the quota, so no one shouts "the quota is too high" anymore. In carpentry, plastering, caulking, and concrete engineering, there are also advanced experiences with universal promotional significance. On the basis of promoting these advanced experiences, the parallel flow operation method of construction according to instruction charts has been created in construction management. The emergence of the parallel flow operation method has changed the face of construction management, and basically eliminated the chaos of work stoppages, waiting for materials, and mutual involvement on the construction site. After many construction sites adopted this advanced management method, the planned management of the construction site was strengthened, and various responsibility systems were consolidated, thus greatly shortening the construction period. Some advanced construction units have been able to complete projects that originally took 120 days in about 40 days. At present, many construction units have applied the parallel flow operation method to various different projects.

The above-mentioned advanced experiences in mechanical installation, mine construction, geological drilling, civil construction, etc., were explored and created by the broad masses of employees under the help of Soviet experts or inspired by Soviet advanced experience, combined with China's specific conditions. Although these experiences are not all absolutely complete and flawless at present, they have all been tested by facts. As long as each basic construction unit can earnestly promote them according to specific circumstances, it can achieve excellent results in improving quality, speeding up speed, and reducing costs. That is to say, as long as we can earnestly promote these advanced experiences with decisive significance, and at the same time mobilize the masses to tirelessly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, give play to our own creativity and enthusiasm, and constantly enrich and enrich the existing advanced experience, we can change the situation of "unfamiliarity and ignorance" and do basic construction work "well," "quickly," and "economically."

At present, the leading cadres of many basic construction units have not, in fact, realized the importance of promoting advanced experience in basic construction work. Many people only verbally attach importance to advanced experience. They think that issuing instructions and holding meetings can promote advanced experience, but they have not taken various effective measures to boldly overcome difficulties and create conditions for promoting advanced experience. Even before this meeting, some comrades still emphasized that the parallel flow operation was not suitable for the situation on their construction site, so it could not be adopted. In fact, most of these comrades either do not understand the parallel flow operation method or do not truly understand the situation on their construction site. Some people even put the promotion of advanced experience in opposition to the completion of basic construction tasks, saying that the tasks are too urgent and there is no time to promote advanced experience, or simply push the promotion work to the technical personnel and think that is the end of it. Some cadres who do Party work and mass work mistakenly believe that this is not their responsibility and cannot do a good job of political and ideological education for the masses in the work of promoting advanced experience. There are many wrong views on the promotion of advanced experience, but the most fundamental obstacle is still conservative thinking: the inability to keenly recognize new things; the lack of courage to boldly break the conventions in work. Experience has proved that without unremittingly fighting against all kinds of conservative thinking, especially the conservative thinking of leading cadres at all levels, the work of promoting advanced experience cannot be carried out smoothly.

Now, all regions, factories, and mining enterprises are working hard to prepare for the large-scale economic construction next year. In the preparation work, we must regard summarizing and learning advanced experience as an important task. The experience gained by the Northeast region in the key construction projects in the past year should arouse the attention of all regions. In the winter training of construction workers, workers should be organized to learn the relevant advanced experiences with decisive significance well. Management cadres and technical personnel should also learn advanced experience on the one hand, and constantly summarize various creations among the masses on the other hand, to improve and enrich existing experience and create new experience. In order to do a better job in the large-scale basic construction work in the future, leading departments at all levels should regularly regard the work of summarizing and promoting advanced experience as a regular and important task.

    推广先进经验是做好基本建设工作的重要方法
    叶志强
    我国大规模的经济建设就要开始。对于我们来说，今后的基本建设工作，比起生产恢复时期的工作，更要艰巨百倍。我们将要建设的许多工厂矿山都是按照苏联的最先进的技术标准进行设计和施工的。这些新型工厂矿山规模的巨大和技术的复杂都是空前的。而这些大规模的工程又只许做好不许做坏，我们必须保证质量、保证按时完工，并努力为国家节省投资。我们在力量极为薄弱、经验极为缺乏的情况下，怎样才能把基本建设工作做得“又好”，“又快”、“又省”呢？重要的方法之一，是大力推广先进经验。
    最近，东北人民政府工业部和东北总工会联合召开了基本建设先进生产者代表会议，初步交流和总结了各方面的先进经验。
    东北地区开始有重点地进行基本建设才只一年。就在这短短的一年中，各基本建设单位的职工，在党和各级人民政府的领导及苏联专家的无私帮助下，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，虚心学习苏联先进经验，在基本建设的各个方面都已开始取得经验，这些经验是我们建设祖国的最宝贵的最有价值的财富。善于学习并继续提高、丰富这些先进经验，就能使我们来年的基本建设工作很好地完成任务。例如重工业建设中的机械安装工程方面：鞍山钢铁公司和东北火电工程公司阜新工程队的职工在苏联专家的指导下，已经学会了“预装配”安装法，同时在安装地脚螺丝和电焊方面也有了很好的创造。这些先进经验的出现，使我们重工业的基本建设在经验不足、技术水平不高的情况下，能够达到苏联最先进的技术标准，并且大大缩短了工期，降低了成本，保证了职工的安全。东北许多重点工程学习了这个先进经验，都收到了很好的效果。又如在矿山建设方面：过去开凿竖井都沿用资本主义国家的落后的单行作业法，建设一对大规模的竖井，一般都要六七年甚至十多年的时间。这样，我国煤炭工业发展的速度，就不能适应国家大规模经济建设的要求。西安矿务局在建设中央竖井的过程中，接受苏联专家的建议，抛弃了落后的资本主义国家的单行作业法而改用平行作业法，加上各发明小组在凿岩方面的创造，以二十个月的时间完成井筒建设的任务，较国家原来的计划提前二十二个月；比用旧的方法，可提前五年竣工。阜新矿务局的马文志钻探小组和东北有色金属管理局的杨春发，学习苏联经验，创造了快速钻进方法和一次给钻粒方法，大大提高了钻进速度，保证了岩芯质量。阜新矿务局百分之八十的钻探小组推广了马文志小组的先进经验，提前一季完成了国家任务。马文志和杨春发的快速钻进经验，对于改变目前钻探工作跟不上设计工作的情况将有很大作用。又如土木建筑方面：从施工管理到操作技术、劳动组织以及工具的改进，都出现了许多先进经验。这些先进经验的出现，使房屋建筑工程获得了重大的革新。苏长有的双手挤浆法，在瓦工的砌砖工作中获得了根本的改革。凡是认真学习了苏长有双手挤浆法的小组，都改变了过去质量低劣进度迟缓的情况。很多小组学习了双手挤浆法后，质量由百分之八十左右提高到百分之九十以上，有的已达百分之百，并且都能突破定额，这就再也没有人喊“定额太高了”。在木工、抹灰、勾缝以及混凝土工程中，同样都出现了有普遍推广意义的先进经验。在推广这些先进经验的基础上，施工管理方面又创造了按指示图表施工的平行流水作业法。平行流水作业法的出现，改变了施工管理的面貌，基本上消灭了工地中的停工待料、互相牵扯等混乱现象。许多工地采用了这一先进的管理方法后，工地的计划管理加强了，各种责任制度巩固了，因而大大缩短了工期。有些先进的施工单位，已经可以把原来需要一百二十天的工程，在四十天左右完成。目前，许多施工单位，已经把平行流水作业法运用到各种不同的工程上去。
    上述机械安装、矿山建设、地质钻探、土木建筑等方面的先进经验，都是广大的职工群众在苏联专家的帮助或苏联先进经验的启发下，结合中国的具体情况摸索创造出来的。这些经验目前虽然并不都是绝对完整无缺的，但是，都已经过事实的考验。各个基本建设单位，只要能够根据具体情况认真地加以推广，就可以在提高质量、加快速度、降低成本方面获得优异的成就。也就是说，只要能够认真地推广这些有决定意义的先进经验，同时发动群众不倦地学习苏联的先进经验，发挥自己的创造性和积极性，不断地充实、丰富现有的先进经验，我们就可以改变“不熟不懂”的情况，把基本建设工作做得“又好”、“又快”、“又省”。
    目前，许多基本建设单位的领导干部，在事实上并没有认识到推广先进经验在基本建设工作中的重要性，许多人还只是在口头上重视先进经验，他们以为发发指示，开开会议就可以把先进经验推广下去了，而没有为此采取各种有效措施，大胆地克服困难，为推广先进经验创造条件。就在这次会议以前，有些同志仍然强调说平行流水作业不适合于他们工地的情况，因而无法采用。实际上，这些同志中的大多数人，不是不懂得平行流水作业法就是不真正了解自己工地的情况。有的人甚至把推广先进经验和完成基本建设任务对立起来，说任务太紧急，无暇推广先进经验，或者是把推广工作简单地推给技术人员就算了事。有些做党的工作和群众工作的干部，错误地认为这不是自己的职责，在推广先进经验工作中不能很好地对群众进行政治思想教育。对于推广先进经验的错误看法是很多的，但最根本的障碍还是保守思想：不能锐敏地认识新鲜事物；不敢大胆地打破工作中的常规。经验证明：不和形形色色的保守思想，特别是各级领导干部的保守思想进行不懈的斗争，先进经验的推广工作就不可能顺利进行。
    现在，各地区、各厂矿企业正在紧张地为明年的大规模经济建设进行准备工作。在准备工作中，必须把总结与学习先进经验当做一项重要的任务。东北地区在一年来的重点建设中取得的经验应该引起各地的重视。在建筑工人的冬季训练中，应该组织工人很好地来学习有关的有决定意义的先进经验。管理干部和技术人员也应该一方面学习先进经验，一方面不断地总结群众中的各种创造，以提高和充实既有的经验和创造新的经验。为着把今后大规模的基本建设工作做得更好，各级领导部门应该经常地把总结与推广先进经验工作作为经常的重要的任务。
