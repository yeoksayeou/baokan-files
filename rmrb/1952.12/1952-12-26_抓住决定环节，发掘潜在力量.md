    Our country is beginning to enter a high tide of national construction. All the people and cadres are showing great enthusiasm to meet this high tide. In order to guide this enthusiasm onto the right track, it is necessary to correctly formulate the national construction plan, which is the most important task in our country's political life today. The two key issues in correctly formulating the national construction plan are being good at seizing the decisive link and being good at discovering potential strength.
    Correctly compiling the national construction plan is by no means simply integrating various numbers. The national construction plan is a concentrated expression of the country's political and economic tasks in a certain period. It is a program and law for the actions of the people of the whole country, stipulating the speed and steps of our country's industrialization and the development path of the national economy and cultural and educational undertakings. Without a plan, or without a correct and practical plan, our construction undertaking will inevitably fall into a state of blindness and passivity, wasting the country's human and financial resources, and even delaying the process of national construction.
    The national plan must conform to the country's current tasks and long-term interests. It must start from the overall situation and grasp the decisive link in the overall situation. What is the decisive link in our construction plan? The task of our construction plan is to realize national industrialization under the conditions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Therefore, the decisive link in front of us is to develop heavy industry, especially those heavy industries that play a decisive role in our national defense construction and national economy. It is very clear that first developing heavy industry, namely hardware, fuel, electric power, and machinery industries, is the only correct path for us to realize national industrialization. It is precisely the link of heavy industry that is sufficient to play a decisive role in consolidating our national defense and the overall development of the economy, and is sufficient to change the face of our country, making our national economy undergo a qualitative change - transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, and achieving economic independence. Comrade Stalin taught us that "The center of industrialization, its foundation, is the development of heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and in the final analysis, it is the development of the production of means of production, the development of the country's machine manufacturing industry." ("On the Soviet Economic Situation and the Party's Policy") The Soviet Union, in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions, realized the plan of industrialization and made itself a powerful industrial country. Chairman Mao instructed us early on to "take the path of the Russians." The path that Soviet industrialization has already taken is also the path that we should and must take.
    Even in the development of heavy industry, we should also distinguish between major projects and minor projects, between urgent projects and non-urgent projects, and first ensure the completion of those major and urgent projects. In short, our construction must concentrate efforts to proceed, using limited funds and construction forces in major and urgent places, resolutely reduce investment in construction that can be postponed, and reduce investment in projects that do not play an important role in national construction, so as to fully guarantee the construction of heavy industry, especially the completion of those projects that play a decisive role in the country, and can rapidly increase the foundation of the country's industry and national defense forces. Whether or not we can do this is the dividing line between whether we are implementing the country's construction policy and policies in words or in actual actions. Dispersing funds and manpower will inevitably hinder the completion of major projects, which is a serious waste, will take more detours, and will cause serious losses to the country.
    Therefore, the idea of ​​not distinguishing between priorities and wishing to complete all "good things" in one morning, the idea of ​​wanting large-scale everywhere, wanting large-scale in everything, wanting large-scale in every district, every village, every county, every province or every department, every bureau, the practice of spending money everywhere, building everywhere, although countless piecemeal "good things" have been done, but which does not play any decisive role in the development of our country's economy, the practice of being greedy and rash without considering subjective forces, especially the local viewpoint of only considering the needs of one's own unit and region without considering the overall situation, are extremely wrong. If we do it according to the above, it will inevitably cause extremely bad results to the country's construction undertaking, and make the country's large-scale construction come to naught. It is precisely because of the arrival of the country's large-scale construction that our country has taken various measures to ensure unified and centralized leadership. Therefore, establishing an overall viewpoint and a long-term viewpoint, and concentrating efforts to ensure the construction of heavy industry, especially the completion of the main projects among them, is a policy that must be implemented when formulating plans, especially basic construction plans. We should use this policy to educate all cadres and the people.
    Of course, concentrating efforts to ensure the construction of heavy industry, especially ensuring the completion of the main projects among them, must not be understood as neglecting to give play to the enthusiasm of local and various economies, neglecting the development of light industry, neglecting the development of local industry and agriculture, neglecting the development of trade and cooperation undertakings and transportation undertakings, and neglecting the development of cultural, educational and health undertakings. If so, it is also completely wrong. Not only because these undertakings will develop accordingly with the development of heavy industry, but also the development of these undertakings will greatly promote the rapid development of national industrialization construction. The state will plan the direction and proportion of the development of various localities and various economic and cultural undertakings in the entire plan, giving full play to their initiative and enthusiasm; and various departments and localities should develop their own undertakings under the unified plan of the state to avoid possible blindness.
    In the basic construction plan, we mainly want to oppose the idea of "everything is waiting to be done"; in the production plan, we mainly want to oppose conservatism. We must fully estimate the potential strength of existing enterprises, so as not to lower the plan. Rationally utilizing the existing industrial base and existing equipment, fully tapping potential strength, and striving to produce more high-quality products is not only to meet the direct needs of the national economy and people's livelihood, but also to accumulate more necessary funds for industrialization. In this regard, any conservative ideas that fear difficulties and are willing to lag behind are very harmful.
    There are some leaders in our enterprises who mistakenly understand the country's large-scale construction as only going to build new ones, while ignoring existing equipment, complaining all day long about old equipment being broken and dilapidated, not actively giving play to the potential of existing equipment, or even putting it aside and not using it, and not actively improving the leadership of existing enterprises. We also have such enterprise leaders who do not believe in the infinite creativity of the working class, only look backward and not forward, are satisfied with existing achievements, they believe that production has "reached the top" and potential has been "tapped out", complacent about "finally surpassing the level of the enemy and puppet period", "this year is always stronger than last year". There are also some comrades who always hope to set the production, technology, and financial plans lower, so that they can leisurely lie in an armchair, not spend any effort, and "happily" "exceed" the plan and get more bonuses. It is very clear that if we formulate our production plan according to the above ideas, it will cause so much loss to the country, the internal accumulation of our enterprises for national construction will be greatly reduced, the material supply needed for construction will inevitably encounter major difficulties, and our construction undertaking will be delayed. Therefore, fighting against conservative ideas and bureaucratism when formulating the plan is a necessary prerequisite for correctly formulating the production, technology, and financial plans.
    Our plan must play an advanced guiding role, otherwise it will completely lose the meaning of the plan. Therefore, the production, technology, and financial plans in our enterprises must be based on the average advanced technical and economic norms, and should not be based on the average statistical norms, let alone the backward technical and economic norms. We should see the favorable factors in all aspects of the enterprise, overcome weaknesses through various efforts, and should not determine production capacity based only on weaknesses. We should fully estimate the infinite creativity of the masses and give play to this creativity as much as possible, and should not turn a blind eye to the creativity of the masses, so that our plan lags behind reality. All of this is the sign to judge whether the plan is advanced or backward.
    Compiling the national construction plan is undoubtedly an extremely complex and arduous task. We must spend less money and do things well - these are the two aspects required by the country. But as long as we oppose both egalitarianism and unrealistic fantasies, and oppose conservatism and bureaucratism that surrender to difficulties, seize the decisive link, and fully tap potential, then we can complete this task relatively satisfactorily and lay a correct track for the great construction undertaking.

### 抓住决定环节，发掘潜在力量

    抓住决定环节，发掘潜在力量
    我国正在开始进入国家建设的高潮。全体人民和干部为迎接这一高潮，表现出很大的积极性。为了把这种积极性引导到正确的轨道，必须正确地制订国家建设计划，这是今天我国政治生活中头等重要的工作。正确地制定国家建设计划的两个关键性问题，就是善于抓住决定环节，善于发掘潜在力量。
    正确地编制国家的建设计划，决不等于把各类数字简单地综合起来。国家的建设计划是国家在一定时期内政治和经济任务的集中表现，是全国人民行动的纲领和法律，它规定着我国工业化的速度和步骤，规定着国民经济和文化教育事业发展的途径。没有计划，或者没有正确而实际的计划，便必然使我们的建设事业陷于盲目状态，陷于被动，浪费国家的人力、财力，以至推迟国家建设的进程。
    国家计划必须符合于国家当前的任务和长远的利益，必须从全局出发，并且抓住全局中的决定环节。什么是我们的建设计划中的决定环节呢？我们的建设计划的任务是要使我国在抗美援朝的条件下实现国家工业化，因此，在我们面前，决定的环节就是发展重工业，特别是那些对我们的国防建设和国民经济起决定作用的重工业。事情很明白，首先发展重工业，即五金、燃料、电力和机械工业等，是我们实现国家工业化唯一正确的道路。正是重工业这一环节，才足以对我们国家国防的巩固和经济的全面发展起决定的作用，才足以改变我们国家的面貌，使我们的国民经济起质的变化——变农业国为工业国，达到经济上的独立。斯大林同志教导我们说：“工业化的中心，它的基础，就是发展重工业
    （燃料、五金等等），归根到底，就是发展生产资料的生产，发展本国的机器制造业。”（“论苏联经济状况和党的政策”）苏联按照斯大林同志的指示，实现了工业化的计划，使自己成了强大的工业国家。毛主席很早就指示我们“走俄国人的路”，苏联工业化已走过的道路，也就是我们应该走和必须走的道路。
    就在发展重工业中，同样也应该区别主要的工程和次要的工程，区别急需的工程和不急需的工程，首先保证那些主要的和急需的工程的完成。总之，我们的建设必须集中力量去进行，把有限的资金和建设力量使用于主要的和急需的地方，坚决削减那些可以推迟的建设的投资、削减那些对国家建设并不起重要作用的工程的投资，以全力保证重工业建设，特别是那些对国家起决定作用的、能迅速增长国家工业的基础和国防力量的工程的完成。能不能这样做，这就是我们究竟是在口头上还是在实际行动中贯彻国家建设的方针和政策的分界线。分散资金和人力，就必然妨碍主要工程的完成，这就是严重的浪费，就要多走弯路，就会对国家造成严重的损失。
    因此，那种不分轻重缓急，希图在一个早晨把所有“好事”办完的想法，那种处处都要大规模、样样都要大规模、每区、每村、每县、每省或每部、每局都要大规模的想法，那种到处花钱、到处建设、虽然办了无数零碎的“好事”，但对我国经济的发展，并不起任何决定作用的做法，那种不考虑主观力量贪多冒进的做法，特别是那种只顾本单位本地区需要而不顾全局的局部观点，是极其错误的。如果按照上述的那样去做，就必然对国家建设事业造成极坏的结果，使国家大规模建设化为乌有。正是由于国家大规模建设的到来，我们国家才采取各种措施来保证统一集中的领导。因此，确立全局观点和长远观点，集中力量保证重工业建设特别是其中主要工程的完成，是制订计划特别是基本建设计划时必须贯彻的方针，我们应当用这种方针来教育所有的干部和人民群众。
    当然，集中力量保证重工业的建设，特别是保证其中主要工程的完成，决不能了解为可以忽视发挥地方的和各种经济的积极性，忽视轻工业的发展，忽视地方工业和农业的发展，忽视贸易合作事业和交通运输事业的发展，以及忽视文化教育卫生事业的发展。如果那样，也是完全错误的。不仅因为这些事业将跟着重工业的发展而相应地发展起来，而且这些事业的发展将大大推动国家工业化建设的迅速发展。国家在整个计划中将要规划出各个地方和各种经济文教事业发展的方向和比例，充分发挥它们的主动性和积极性；而各部门和各地方则应当在国家统一的计划下面发展自己的事业，以避免可能发生的盲目性。
    在基本建设的计划中，我们主要地要反对那种“百废俱兴”的思想；在生产计划中，主要地要反对保守主义。我们必须充分估计现有企业的潜在力量，以免把计划压低。合理地利用现有的工业基础和现有设备，充分地发掘潜在力量，力求生产更多的质量优良的产品，这不但是为了满足国计民生的直接需要，而且还是为工业化积累更多的必要的资金。在这个方面，任何害怕困难、甘于落后的保守主义思想都是非常有害的。
    我们的企业中有这样一些领导者，他们把国家进行大规模建设错误地了解为只是去建设新的，而忽视现有设备，成天埋怨旧设备破破烂烂，不去积极地发挥现有设备的潜在力，甚至将其搁置不用，不去积极地改善现有企业的领导。我们还有这样的企业领导者，他们不相信工人阶级无穷的创造力，只往后看不往前看，满足于已有成绩，他们认为生产已经“到顶”，潜力已经“挖光”，沾沾自喜于“总算是超过了敌伪时期的水平”，“今年总比去年强”。也有这样一些同志，他们总希望把生产、技术、财务计划订得低一些，这样就可以逍遥自在地躺在安乐椅上，不要花费任何气力而“愉快地”“超过”计划，多得奖金。事情很明白，如果按照上述思想来制订我们的生产计划，就会对国家造成多么大的损失，我们借以进行国家建设的企业内部的积累就会大为减少，建设所需要的物资供应也就必然会遇到重大的困难，我们的建设事业就会被拖迟。因此，在编制计划时与保守思想和官僚主义作斗争，是正确编制生产、技术、财务计划的必要前提。
    我们的计划必须起先进的指导的作用，否则就将完全失去计划的意义。因此，我们企业中的生产、技术、财务计划必须以平均的先进技术经济定额为根据，而不应以平均统计定额更不能以落后的技术经济定额为根据。应该看到企业中各方面的有利因素，经过各种努力来克服薄弱环节，而不能只根据薄弱环节来确定生产能力。应该充分估计群众的无穷创造力，并尽可能发挥这种创造力，而不应该对群众的创造熟视无睹，以至使我们的计划落后于实际。这一切，也就是判别计划的先进或落后的标志。
    编制国家建设计划，无疑是一件极为复杂而艰巨的任务。既要钱用得少，又要事情办得好——这就是国家要求的两个方面。但是只要我们既反对平均主义和不切实际的空想，又反对向困难投降的保守主义和官僚主义，抓住决定环节，充分发掘潜力，那么，我们就能够比较完满地完成这个任务，为伟大的建设事业铺好正确的轨道。
