　　Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued the instruction to "place capital construction in a primary position," all relevant departments are actively and conscientiously implementing this instruction. However, implementing this instruction is not a simple matter and requires a series of heavy and complex tasks. Taking only the engineering tasks to be completed next year, from determining the plan, allocating resources, and carrying out design to the direct preparations for construction, there are many things that need to be done before the start of construction. In this situation, relying solely on determination and a positive attitude is not enough. Leading cadres at all levels must, based on the instructions from higher authorities and their analysis of the situation in their own departments, grasp the most important tasks, concentrate resources, and personally guide them in a planned and step-by-step manner.

　　Concentrating resources to do the main work well during a certain period is a very important leadership method. Currently, in capital construction, it is even more necessary to master such leadership methods because of the heavy tasks, tight deadlines, and limited resources. Otherwise, even if a lot of effort is spent, the tasks still cannot be completed well. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has taken the correct approach in this regard, and especially the ideological mobilization work and the preparation work for design and construction are worth referring to by other departments.

　　To implement the policy of "placing capital construction in a primary position," the most practical thing to do at present is to gather resources and strengthen institutions, which is the material foundation for determining whether the policy can be implemented. All departments have a common understanding of this point and are now busy carrying out this work. However, some departments have not paid attention to the prerequisites for ensuring the smooth progress of this work, and to the ideological mobilization work that must be carried out for the transfer of cadres; as a result, "more haste, less speed," there are many difficulties and great resistance in transferring cadres, which affects many important preparatory work from being carried out quickly. These departments should learn from the experience of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, combine it with the current work of transferring cadres to make up for the "missed lessons," and do the ideological mobilization work thoroughly and meticulously. This is not only necessary for the current transfer of cadres. Doing this work thoroughly will benefit a series of work in the future. Only when cadres' thoughts are clear and everyone is united, can the policy of "placing capital construction in a primary position" be truly implemented.

　　Due to the urgency of time, direct preparations for capital construction next year need to be started immediately. In the preparatory work for design, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in addition to organizing the review of designs, has particularly focused on urging and inspecting its subordinate units to formulate design progress plans; in the preparatory work for construction, it has focused on the preparation of materials and equipment, vigorously organized winter training for cadres and permanent workers, distributed the construction tasks for next year to various construction units as early as possible, and appropriately adjusted the resources based on the complexity of the tasks. It is also correct to focus on these key points in the preparatory work.

    抓住基本建设准备工作的主要环节
    自从政务院财政经济委员会发出“把基本建设放在首要地位”的指示以后，各有关部门都正积极地认真地贯彻这一指示。但是，贯彻这一指示并不是一件简单的事，必须做一系列的繁重复杂的工作。仅就明年要完成的工程任务来说，从确定计划，调配力量、进行设计到施工的直接准备工作，在开工之前需要做好的事就非常多。在这种情况下，仅仅依靠决心和积极的态度是不够的，各级领导干部必须根据上级的指示和对本部门情况的分析，抓住几件最重要的工作，集中力量，有计划有步骤地亲自加以指导。
    在一定时期中集中力量做好主要的工作，这是一项很重要的领导方法。目前在基本建设中由于任务重、时间紧、力量弱，掌握这样的领导方法就更为必要。否则，即使花费的力量很大，任务仍旧不能很好地完成。中央重工业部在这方面的做法是正确的，特别是思想动员工作与设计、施工的准备工作更值得其他部门参考。
    要贯彻“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，目前最有实际意义的事情莫过于集结力量、加强机构，这乃是决定方针能否贯彻的物质基础。各部门对这一点的认识是一致的，现在都正在忙于进行这一工作。但是，对保证这一工作顺利进行的先决条件，对于为抽调干部而必须进行的思想动员工作，有些部门却没有重视；结果，“欲速则不达”，抽调干部时困难很多，阻力很大，影响许多重要的准备工作都不能迅速着手进行。这些部门应该吸取重工业部的经验，结合着目前抽调干部的工作进行“补课”，充分地细致地把思想动员工作做好。不仅仅为了目前抽调干部需要这样做。这件工作做透了对以后一系列的工作都有好处。只有干部思想通了，上下一致了，“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针才能够真正贯彻。
    由于时间紧迫，明年基本建设的直接准备工作需要立即着手进行。重工业部在设计的准备工作中，除了组织审核设计外，特别抓紧了督促检查所属各单位制订设计进度计划的工作；在施工准备工作中，抓紧了材料、设备的准备，大力组织干部和固定工的冬季训练，及早给各施工单位分配好明年的施工任务，并根据任务繁简适当调整了力量。在准备工作中抓住这样几个重点，也是正确的。
