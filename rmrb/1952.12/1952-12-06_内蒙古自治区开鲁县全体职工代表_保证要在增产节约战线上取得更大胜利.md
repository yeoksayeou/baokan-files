To our respected Chairman Mao: We, the entire staff of Kailu County, enthusiastically respond to your great call to actively participate in the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign. Under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels, our entire staff has worked hard and achieved great results in various aspects. We convened the county's first Trade Union Member Representative Congress to review and summarize the work of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee over the past two years. Now we have established our own organization—the Kailu County Federation of Trade Unions—and have determined the work tasks for 1953. All of us deeply understand that the position of the Chinese working class is glorious and the historical tasks it bears are significant. We, all the representatives, hereby declare to you: We are determined to unite as one under your wise leadership, overcome all difficulties, and achieve greater victories on the production increase and thrift campaign front.
