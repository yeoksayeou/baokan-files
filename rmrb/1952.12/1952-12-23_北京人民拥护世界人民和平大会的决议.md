(Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd) The people of Beijing are celebrating the successful conclusion of the World Peace Congress with unparalleled excitement.

	Chen Puquan, an advanced producer at the First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory who completed the year's production task in nine months and twenty-six and a half days, said: I will support the resolutions of the World Peace Congress with practical actions such as finding more tricks and improving work efficiency. We hope that people of all countries can live a peaceful and happy life. A worker named Sun Zhenhua wanted to become a musician before liberation, but he was often unemployed. After liberation, he lived a peaceful and happy life, and his musical talent was developed. With the help of musicians, he has composed four pieces. After seeing the news of the closing of the World Peace Congress, he happily said: The declaration and letter to the five major powers governments passed at the conference are what every kind person in the world urgently demands, and we must strive to achieve them all.
	Professors from various universities in Beijing felt extremely excited about the successful conclusion of the World Peace Congress. Jian Bozan, the director of the History Department of Peking University and a Chinese delegate to the First World Congress for Peace, said: This World Peace Congress is much larger in scale than the First World Congress for Peace, and the issues discussed are also more profound and specific than the First World Congress for Peace; this proves that the forces defending peace are stronger than before! Lei Jieqiong, the Dean of Beijing College of Political Science and Law, said: The declaration and letter to the five major powers governments of the World Peace Congress fully express the will and desire of the people of the world to demand peace. We must carry out the peace movement more deeply and extensively and strive to implement the resolutions of the World Peace Congress!
	Childcare workers who nurture the next generation hope that children will always live in peace and happiness, and the resolutions of the World Peace Congress have strengthened their confidence in realizing this hope. Li Guixin, a childcare worker at Beihai Kindergarten, said: Everyone loves their own children, and we, who specialize in caring for and educating children, are even more so, but only peace can bring happiness to children. In the future, we must make greater efforts to defend lasting world peace!
	Countless housewives also celebrated the closing of the World Peace Congress with the same excitement. A housewife named Li Shuzhen said: We fully support all the resolutions of the World Peace Congress. Everything has become better for us in a peaceful life. I was illiterate before, but now I have joined a crash literacy class and learned 2,127 characters in just over twenty days; I used to have to think a lot before buying a piece of clothing, but now I buy it when I want to; I couldn't even afford mixed noodles before, but now I eat white noodles every day!

    【新华社二十二日讯】北京人民以无比兴奋的心情庆贺世界人民和平大会胜利闭幕。
    用九个月零二十六天半的时间就完成了今年全年生产任务的华北农业机械厂第一分厂的先进生产者陈普全说：我要用多找窍门、提高工作效率的实际行动，来支持世界人民和平大会的决议，我们希望各国人民都能过着和平幸福的生活。一个叫做孙振华的工人，解放以前他想成为音乐家，但他经常失业，解放以后，他过着和平幸福的生活，他的音乐天才被发挥，在音乐家的帮助下，他已作了四个曲。当他看到世界人民和平大会闭幕的消息后，高兴地说：在会上通过的大会宣言和致五大国政府书，是世界上每一个善良的人民所迫切要求的，我们要努力争取它全部实现。
    北京各大学的教授们，为世界人民和平大会的胜利闭幕而感到无比的兴奋。出席第一届世界拥护和平大会的中国代表、北京大学历史系主任翦伯赞说：这一次世界人民和平大会的规模比第一届世界拥护和平大会大得多，讨论的问题也比第一届世界拥护和平大会深刻、具体；这证明保卫和平的力量比以前更为壮大了！北京政法学院教务长雷洁琼说：世界人民和平大会的宣言和致五大国政府书，完全表达了全世界人民要求和平的意志和愿望，我们要更加深入广泛地开展和平运动，为贯彻世界人民和平大会的决议而努力！
    抚育后代的保教员们切望儿童们永远在和平幸福里生活着，世界人民和平大会的决议增强了他们实行这一希望的信心。北海幼儿园的保教员李桂馨说：每一个人都是喜爱自己的孩子的，我们专做照护和教育孩子的人更是如此，但是只有和平才能给孩子带来幸福，今后我们必须为保卫世界持久的和平作更大的努力！
    无数的家庭妇女们，也带着同样兴奋的心情来庆贺世界人民和平大会的闭幕。一个叫做李淑珍的家庭妇女说：我们完全拥护世界人民和平大会的一切决议，在和平生活里我们一切都变好了。从前我不识字，现在参加了速成识字班，二十多天就学会了二千一百二十七个字；从前要买一件衣服不知要想多少心思，现在要买就买；从前连混合面都吃不上，现在天天吃白面了！
