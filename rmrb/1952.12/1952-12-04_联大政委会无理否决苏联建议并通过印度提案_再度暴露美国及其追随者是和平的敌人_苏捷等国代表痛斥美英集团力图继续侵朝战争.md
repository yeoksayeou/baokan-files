　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 3rd: The Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Indian proposal regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war and the Soviet amendments on December 1st, and a vote was taken.

　　The discussion on the Soviet amendments proved that the United States and other countries following the US policy of aggression do not want to end the Korean War and oppose a peaceful resolution to the Korean problem. While the leaders of the US-British bloc put on the guise of "peace envoys," their opposition to the Soviet proposal for an immediate and complete ceasefire on land, at sea, and in the air in Korea completely exposed their false and hypocritical nature. The United States, Britain, and the countries that follow them have once again exposed themselves before world opinion as enemies of peace.

　　The speeches of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Belarus in the committee exposed the attempts by the leaders of the US-British bloc to defend the US military command's refusal to repatriate all prisoners of war. The US and British representatives also attempted to distort the facts by citing international law and the Geneva Convention to defend the barbaric actions of the US military command in Korea. All these attempts were also defeated.

　　The Soviet delegation and the Polish and Czechoslovak delegations proved that such citations are untenable and that there is no legal justification for detaining prisoners of war.

　　American newspapers admit that the Soviet amendments have caused great panic among the leaders of the US-British bloc. For example, the "New York Times" stated that they fear that the people of India and other Asian countries will notice that their representatives voted against ending the war.

　　As for the Indian delegation, which tried to act as a mediator, it has run into the US-British camp.

　　The Indian representative, Menon, speaking at the meeting, could not refute any of the reasons given by the Soviet delegation against the Indian proposal. His entire speech confirmed that the proposal was a notorious American proposal that was only somewhat disguised to deceive public opinion.

　　The Indian representative groundlessly claimed that he had the right to speak on behalf of the Asian people, although no one except the US ruling clique had authorized him to do so.

　　Regarding the main issue in the Indian proposal—the repatriation of prisoners of war—Menon admitted that the Indian proposal allows for not sending all prisoners of war home. In other words, the Indian proposal supports the position of the US military command in Korea.

　　The Indian representative said that there is a difference between the US proposal and the Indian delegation's proposal in the handling of the repatriation of prisoners of war.

　　However, in his speech, he, like the representatives of the US-British bloc, harped on the fallacy of not being able to "forcibly repatriate." Everyone knows that the purpose of these words is to conceal the criminal actions of the US military command in trying to obstruct the repatriation of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

　　Menon also admitted that the Indian delegation's proposal stipulates that prisoners of war who are not repatriated will be handed over to the United Nations. It is quite clear that this actually means handing the prisoners of war over to the US military command.

　　The Indian representative tried his best to prove that his proposal eliminates the possibility of exerting pressure on prisoners of war "in the future" to force them to refuse to return home. However, he remained silent about the fact that the US military command has already been widely exerting this kind of pressure. For this purpose, they have used all kinds of evil means, including massacres, to force prisoners of war to refuse to return home. The Indian representative could not give any reason to oppose the Soviet proposal for a ceasefire in Korea. He simply said that the Indian proposal was also for the same purpose, but he did not say a word to explain why the Indian delegation so resolutely refused to include the demand for an immediate ceasefire in the proposal.

　　The Indian representative thus showed that the proposer of this proposal and the delegation that supported it do not want a ceasefire in Korea, but are trying to prolong hostilities.

　　Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky spoke next. He pointed out that Indian representative Menon's speech vividly proved that the Soviet delegation's criticism of the Indian proposal as aiming to prolong rather than end the Korean War was reasonable and just.

　　Most of Vyshinsky's speech explained the reasons why the Soviet Union proposed amendments to the Indian proposal. This amendment put forward a realistic plan to end the Korean War and pointed out a practical and feasible way to resolve the entire Korean issue. Vyshinsky cited an article by Canadian journalist Stevenson, which was deeply impressive. Stevenson reported in this article how the US military command in Korea used Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandits to cruelly persecute captured personnel of the North Korean army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, forcing them to refuse to return home.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation asked the committee to pay attention to some news in American newspapers that expressed concern that a cessation of the Korean War might lead to the decline of American businesses. He emphasized that American multi-billionaires are stubbornly trying to continue the Korean War.

　　Czechoslovak delegation leader Sekaninova pointed out that Menon's speech and the proposal he pointed to both proved that the Indian delegation was of no help in repatriating all prisoners of war. On the contrary, it pointed out the path to illegally detaining prisoners of war.

　　Sekaninova said that the Czechoslovak delegation firmly advocated the immediate and complete cessation of hostilities in Korea in accordance with the recommendations made in the Soviet amendments. The Czechoslovak delegation strongly supported the amendments to the Indian proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation.

　　Polish delegation leader Skrzeszewski said that the Indian representative emphasized in his speech that his proposal was a compromise. Skrzeszewski continued: But this "compromise" can only satisfy one party—the United States. In fact, the demands of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China have not been considered, and the governments of these countries oppose the Indian proposal. The head of the Polish delegation expressed support for the Soviet amendments, saying that if the committee rejects these amendments, the Polish delegation will vote against the Indian proposal.

　　As the meeting was drawing to a close, a vote was taken on the Soviet amendments to the Indian proposal.

　　The first amendment proposed by the Soviet delegation was regarding the following in the Indian proposal, which hypocritically stated that force must not be used to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, nor should force be used to force the repatriation of prisoners of war. It is known that the US military authorities have widely used force to obstruct the repatriation of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and by talking about "non-forcible repatriation," they are only trying to cover up the US military command's forced detention of prisoners of war. The Soviet amendment advocated deleting the hypocritical remarks about not using force from the proposal and firmly demanded that prisoners of war be treated humanely forever. This amendment was rejected by the American and British majority in the committee. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Poland voted in favor of this amendment. Eight delegations (Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Burma, and Indonesia) abstained.

　　Then, a vote was taken on another Soviet amendment, which suggested that the belligerent countries in Korea immediately and completely cease fire based on the draft agreement already agreed upon by the belligerent countries, and suggested that the issue of the complete repatriation of prisoners of war be submitted to a committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue for resolution. Five delegations (the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Ukraine) voted in favor of this proposal, and eight delegations (Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen) abstained. It is intriguing that the representatives of India and Pakistan also voted against this proposal along with the United States and Britain, although they had hypocritically said more than once in the First Committee meeting that they were in favor of a ceasefire in Korea.

　　The American and British majority voted against the amendment advocating the establishment of a committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, which would be composed of directly concerned countries and other countries, including those that did not participate in the Korean War. The US-British bloc then voted against all other amendments to the Indian proposal by the Soviet Union and passed the Indian proposal like a machine. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine voted against the entire Indian proposal.

### 联大政委会无理否决苏联建议并通过印度提案  再度暴露美国及其追随者是和平的敌人  苏捷等国代表痛斥美英集团力图继续侵朝战争

　　联大政委会无理否决苏联建议并通过印度提案
    再度暴露美国及其追随者是和平的敌人
    苏捷等国代表痛斥美英集团力图继续侵朝战争
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约三日讯：十二月一日，政治委员会结束了印度关于遣返战俘问题的提案及苏联修正案的讨论，并进行了表决。
    关于苏联修正案的讨论证明：美国及追随美国侵略政策的其他国家不想结束朝鲜战争，反对和平解决朝鲜问题。美英集团的首领们装出一付“和平使者”的面孔，可是他们又反对苏联关于在朝鲜陆上、海上和空中立即完全停火的建议，这就完全揭穿了他们的虚假的和伪善的面目。美国、英国及追随它们的国家已经在世界舆论面前再度暴露出他们是和平的敌人。
    苏联、波兰、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克与白俄罗斯代表在委员会里的发言，揭露了美英集团首领为美军司令部拒绝遣返全体战俘辩解的企图。美英代表还企图歪曲事实地引证国际法和日内瓦公约，来为美军司令部在朝鲜的野蛮行动辩解，所有这些企图也都遭到了失败。
    苏联代表团及波兰与捷克斯洛伐克代表团证明，这种引证是站不住脚的，扣留战俘没有任何合法理由。
    美国报纸承认，苏联修正案使美英集团的首领大为恐慌。例如，《纽约时报》就说，他们害怕印度和其他亚洲国家的人民会注意到他们的代表投票反对停止战争。
    至于试图充当调停人的印度代表团，则已跑到美英阵营里去了。
    在会议上发言的印度代表梅农驳不倒苏联代表团反对印度提案的任何理由，他的整个发言证实这个提案是一个只是为了欺骗舆论多多少少伪装起来的臭名昭彰的美国提案。
    印度代表毫无理由地自称他有权代表亚洲人民发言，虽然除去美国统治集团以外，没有一个人曾授权他这样做。
    关于印度提案中的主要问题——遣返战俘问题，梅农承认印度提案允许不把全部战俘遣送回家。换句话说，印度提案支持朝鲜美军司令部的态度。
    印度代表说，在遣返战俘问题的处理上，美国提案和印度代表团的提案是有区别的。
    然而，在他的演说里面，他却和美英集团代表一样大弹其不得“强迫遣返”的滥调。每一个人都知道，这种话的目的是要掩饰企图阻挠遣返朝中战俘的美军司令部的罪恶行动。
    梅农同时承认：印度代表团提案规定将没有遣返的战俘交给联合国。十分明显，实际上这就是说把战俘交给美军司令部。
    印度代表尽力想证明他的提案消除了“将来”对战俘行使压力迫使他们拒绝回家的可能性。可是他却缄口不谈这个事实：美军司令部已在普遍行使这种压力。他们为了这个目的，用尽一切罪恶手段，包括屠杀在内，迫使战俘拒绝回家。印度代表无法说出任何理由来反对苏联关于朝鲜停火的提案。他只是说印度提案也是为了同一目的，但是他没有说一句话来解释为什么印度代表团如此坚决地拒绝在提案中列入立刻停火的要求。
    印度代表这样就表明了：这个提案的提案人以及支持这个提案的代表团不要朝鲜停火，而是尽力延续敌对行动。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基接着发言。他指出印度代表梅农的发言生动地证明了：苏联代表团批评印度提案目的在于延续而不是结束朝鲜战争，这样说是有理由的和公正的。
    维辛斯基发言的大部分是说明苏联对印度提案提出修正案的理由。这个修正案提出了一个结束朝鲜战争的现实的方案，并且指出了解决整个朝鲜问题的实际可行的道路。维辛斯基援引了加拿大记者史蒂文森的一篇文章，给人以深刻的印象。史蒂文森在这篇文章中报道了朝鲜美军司令部如何利用国民党和李承晚匪徒对北朝鲜军队和中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行残酷的迫害，强迫他们拒绝回家。
    苏联代表团团长要求委员会注意美国报纸的一些消息，这些消息对停止朝鲜战争可能促使美国的企业衰落表示忧虑。他着重指出，美国亿万豪富正顽固地力图继续朝鲜战争。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃指出，梅农的发言和他所指出的提案都证明印度代表团对遣返全部战俘毫无帮助，相反的，却指出了非法扣留战俘的道路。
    塞卡尼诺娃说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团坚决主张依照苏联修正案中提出的建议，立刻完全停止朝鲜战事。捷克斯洛伐克代表团大力支持苏联代表团对印度提案提出的修正案。
    波兰代表团团长斯克列杰夫斯基说，印度代表在他的发言中强调指出，他的提案是一个折衷方案。斯克列杰夫斯基继续说：但是，这个“折衷方案”只能使一方——美国——满意。实际上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的要求并没有受到考虑，而这些国家的政府是反对印度提案的。波兰代表团团长表示支持苏联的修正案，他说，如果委员会拒绝这些修正案，波兰代表团就要投票反对印度提案。
    在会议快要结束的时候，就苏联对印度提案提出的修正案进行了表决。
    苏联代表团提出的第一项修正是关于印度提案中的下述一项的，这一项里面伪善地说，既不得为了阻挠战俘遣返对他们使用武力，也不得为了强迫战俘遣返而对他们使用武力。人们知道，美国军事当局已广泛使用过武力来阻挠遣返朝中战俘，并谈论“非强迫的遣返”，他们这样做的目的只是要掩饰美军司令部强迫扣留战俘的行为。苏联修正案主张自提案中删除关于不使用武力的虚伪言论，并坚决要求永远以人道的态度对待战俘。这个修正案被委员会的美英多数拒绝了。苏联、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯和波兰投票赞成这个修正案。八国代表团（阿富汗、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、埃及、也门、缅甸和印度尼西亚）弃权。
    然后对苏联的另一个修正案进行表决，这个修正案建议朝鲜的交战国根据已由交战国同意的协议草案，立即完全停火，并建议将全部遣返战俘问题提交和平解决朝鲜问题委员会解决。五国代表团（苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯和乌克兰）投票赞成这个建议，八国代表团（阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、印度尼西亚、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和也门）弃权。耐人寻味的是印度和巴基斯坦代表也和美国、英国一道投票反对这个建议，虽然在第一委员会会议上，他们曾不止一次伪善地说，他们是赞成在朝鲜停火的。
    美英多数投票反对主张成立和平解决朝鲜问题委员会的修正案，这个委员会由直接有关国家与其它国家，包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家组成。美英集团然后投票反对苏联对于印度提案的所有其它各点修正，并像机器一样地通过了印度提案。苏联、波兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰代表团投票反对整个印度提案。
