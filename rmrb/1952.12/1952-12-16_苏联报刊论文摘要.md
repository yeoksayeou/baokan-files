    Striving for Further Upsurge in Heavy Machine Manufacturing

    The Soviet "Labor Newspaper" published an article by Yaroslavtsev, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Workers in Heavy Machine Manufacturing in the Soviet Union, on October 19th, discussing some shortcomings in the work that the Soviet heavy machine manufacturing industry should pay attention to in striving to fulfill its tasks in the new Five-Year Plan. The abstract is as follows:

    Further improving the quality indicators of industrial work has special significance in the new Five-Year Plan. When producing machines with higher performance, we must greatly reduce the amount of time, labor, metal, fuel, and electricity spent on each machine and continuously reduce production costs. Trade union organizations play a significant role in completing these tasks.

    The Sixth Plenary Session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions pointed out in its resolution that producers should not only pay attention to completing plans and production quotas, but also to improving product quality, reducing its cost, practicing thrift in materials and machinery, and better utilizing technology. Every trade union group leader should follow this instruction to advise workers; in addition to the quantity of parts, they must also be responsible for specific clauses related to reducing metal consumption, better utilizing tools, and improving manufacturing precision. At the same time, they should practically help them fulfill their responsibilities. However, this important responsibility of trade union activists is often forgotten.

    In most cases, the chairmen of our factory committees can accurately understand the situation of each workshop in the past 24 hours, knowing how many finished products a certain workshop has manufactured and how the enterprise adheres to work charts to complete product production. However, at the same time, many workshop committees (not to mention factory committees) often cannot name the workers who have not fulfilled their responsibilities in the previous shift. These reports are often made only once every ten days, and some factories even report only at the end of the month. In such cases, how can we help the laggards in a timely manner? The new tasks require us to lead the competition more specifically and effectively. Every incident of a worker failing to fulfill their responsibilities should be notified to the workshop committee and factory committee on the same day.

    Currently, the work of promoting advanced production experience has become more important. Many factories are widely adopting the method of Engineer Kovalev for this purpose, studying the work methods of Stakhanovite workers in detail and compiling their writings. However, our adoption of progressive methods is still slow. What is the problem? The main reason is that adopting the work methods of Stakhanovite workers has not yet become a necessary duty of the workshop administration. Some factories are still hesitant about how to adopt the new methods of Stakhanovite workers, even though the Stakhanovite workers themselves have already suggested solutions to this task.

    To master new products, we must adopt more advanced technical procedures, strengthen the precision of parts manufacturing, and further improve the overall production level of enterprises. Therefore, trade union organizations should pay special attention to improving the professional level of cadres. We should not be satisfied that most workers have already studied in Stakhanovite schools and various groups. We must create a suitable environment for learners, supervise the quality of coursework, and critically review existing teaching materials. However, in this regard, our work is far from sufficient.

    Technical learning plays an important role in improving workers' cultural and technical levels. However, there are still many shortcomings in this regard. Surprisingly, there is no unified syllabus for minimum technical knowledge in our industrial sector. Each factory formulates its own syllabus according to its own ideas. It is not surprising that these syllabuses cannot meet the new requirements put forward to metallurgical workers today. A worker who has completed the minimum technical course often lacks a concept of geometry. How can he carry out work, for example, checking the angle of cutting grooves? Now is the time to include basic knowledge of geometry, physics, and chemistry in the minimum technical course. The relevant departments of the Ministry of Heavy Machine Manufacturing should jointly formulate a unified technical syllabus with the staff of the Rationalization Research Institute of Heavy Machine Manufacturing.

    In accordance with the new tasks facing the heavy machine manufacturing industry, the role of various factory laboratories is also further enhanced. According to the significance and nature of their work, we can unexaggeratedly call them the scientific research institutes of the factory. In addition to basic scientific research and supervision work, these laboratories can do a lot of work in deeply studying and summarizing the advanced experience of Stakhanovite workers.

    The Soviet heavy machine manufacturing industry is steadily advancing along the road of specialization and broad cooperation among enterprises. Currently, when each department faces the task of mastering unique technologies, the significance of production cooperation is even greater. The timely production of many new machines largely depends on the coordinated and precise work of several enterprises. Unfortunately, this principle has not been universally understood. Some individual factories often disrupt the deadlines for supplying key machine parts and components, which hinders the assembly of the entire machine. It would be appropriate for the employees' committees of factories and workshops to organize public supervision over the completion of orders from neighboring factories.

    The Progress of Soviet Science and Technology

    The Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Arabishev, President of the Kalinin Polytechnic Institute of Leningrad, on October 29th, entitled "The Progress of Soviet Science and Technology." The article used the example of the institute to illustrate the great significance of cooperation between scientific workers and enterprises. The abstract is as follows:

    The creative cooperation between scientific workers and producers is the soul of technological progress and an inexhaustible source for developing the technology of the motherland. The close connection between the two can help the exploration in science, expand the experimental basis of research, and enable scientific discoveries, inventions, and improvements to be quickly applied to production.

    The scientific institutions and industrial enterprises in Leningrad have signed cooperation contracts. The themes of all scientific research work in some higher technical schools and scientific research institutes are mostly oriented to the needs of production and the needs of technological progress.

    Creative cooperation has produced new forms of mutual contact between scientific organizations and production organizations. The results of creative cooperation have actively promoted the technological progress of Leningrad's industry. In 1951 alone, hundreds of new modern machines, instruments, machine tools, and appliances were started to be manufactured, including powerful turbines, generators, electrical machines, optical instruments, and mechanical instruments. With the help of scientists, advanced methods of mechanical metalworking using high-frequency currents were devised. Now high-speed metal cutting methods have a scientific basis. In addition, more economical methods for manufacturing plastics have been devised. Automation has been widely adopted in production. Continuously enriching the results of creative cooperation has enabled Leningrad's machinery manufacturing industry to reach a level capable of manufacturing the latest and most complex machines.

    Consolidating creative cooperation and socialist assistance to industry has become one of the basic forms of scientific research activities in the departments of the engineering institute. Recently, the "Kalinin" Polytechnic Institute signed contracts with 94 enterprises and institutions in the country to carry out 142 large-scale research projects on current issues.

    Scientists have demonstrated patriotic initiative in assisting factories to complete orders for the great communist construction faster and better. The staff of the Department of Machine Manufacturing organized a comprehensive group in the Stalin Metallurgical Factory to explore the manufacture of complex hydraulic turbine hubs. This group proposed advanced methods for manufacturing parts, which guaranteed high production and also significantly improved the quality of products. Currently, 540 researchers from 74 departments of the engineering institute are engaged in the work stipulated in the cooperation contract. Scientists are working in the technical committees of 56 factories and enterprises in Leningrad. About 700 students of the engineering institute also actively participate in the cooperation. They conduct research work in the laboratories of various departments, write graduation theses and academic theses with practical and educational value, and conduct research work in factories during production internships.

    Concluding comprehensive contracts with enterprises to solve a series of technical problems and promote the technological progress of factories is a new way of creative cooperation. It is not a department but many departments that have signed such contracts. The fact that 19 departments of the engineering institute signed a joint contract with the "Kirov" factory this year is an example. There are also some contracts that stipulate that several scientific research institutions cooperate with factories to solve technical problems of great significance.

    The creative cooperation between scientists and industrial workers has had a good impact on the educational work of the engineering institute. The latest and practical industrial achievements have enriched the teaching work and greatly helped in training experts. Due to this cooperation, experts have a clear understanding of both the practical and theoretical aspects of the problems they are studying.

    Creative cooperation is the most reliable method to solve the fundamental problems of technological progress in production.

    The major tasks stipulated in the historical resolution of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union entrust Soviet scientists to continuously consolidate their ties with the rapidly developing industry. The task of Soviet scientists is to further strive to consolidate the creative cooperation between science and production, which enriches science with practical experience and helps practical workers solve the tasks before them more quickly. The results of scientific research should be applied to practice more boldly in order to ensure the further upsurge of the entire national economy with the minimum consumption of manpower.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    争取重型机器制造业的进一步高涨
    苏联“劳动报”十月十九日刊载了苏联重型机器制造业工会中央委员会主席雅罗斯拉甫采夫的论文，探讨苏联重型机器制造业在争取完成它在新五年计划的任务中，应注意改进的一些工作缺点，摘要如下：
    进一步改进工业工作的质量指标，在新的五年计划中具有特殊的意义。我们在出产具有更高度使用性能的机器时，必须使每件机器上所花费的时间、劳动、金属、燃料和电力的数量大大减少，并不断降低产品成本。而工会组织对于完成这些任务，是起着不小作用的。
    全苏工会中央理事会第六次全会在它的决议中指出，必须使生产竞赛者们不仅注意完成计划和生产定额，而且注意提高产品质量，降低它的成本，厉行物资和机器的节约和更好地运用技术。每个工会小组长都应当遵循这个指示劝告工人；他们除了对零件的数量还须对有关减少金属消耗，更好地利用工具和提高制作的精确度的具体条款负责。同时，实际地帮助他们履行责任。可是工会积极分子的这个重要责任竟常常被忘却了。
    在多数情况下，我们工厂委员会的主席都能确切了解每个车间在过去一昼夜中工作的情形。某个车间制造了多少成品，企业怎样坚持照工作图表完成产品的生产。但是同时，却也有很多车间委员会
    （更不用说工厂委员会了）常不能说出在上一个班中未履行自己责任的工人的名字。这类通报常每隔十天才做一次，有些工厂甚至仅在月底才汇报一次。在这类情况下，试问怎能及时帮助落后者呢？新的任务要求我们更具体和有效地领导竞赛。工人没有履行其所负责任的每一事件都应在当日通知车间委员会和工厂委员会。
    目前推广先进生产经验的工作已经具有更重要的意义。很多工厂为这一目的正广泛地采用郭瓦廖夫工程师的方法，详细研究斯塔哈诺夫工作者的工作法并编纂他们的著述。但是我们对进步方法的采用却仍是慢吞吞的。问题在那里呢？主要原因是采用斯塔哈诺夫工作者的工作法还没有成为车间行政的必须的职责。有些工厂，直到现在，对于斯塔哈诺夫工作者的新办法如何采用，仍然犹豫不决，虽然斯塔哈诺夫工作者本人早已提示了这一任务的解决方法。
    要掌握新产品就必须采用更完善的技术程序，加强零件制造的精确度和使企业的全部生产水平获得进一步的提高。因此，工会组织应当特别关怀干部业务水平的提高。不应当以大多数工人已在斯塔哈诺夫工作者学校和各种小组中学习而感到满足。必须为学习者创造适当的环境，必须监督课业的质量，并批判地审查现有的教材。但是，在这方面，我们的工作做得还大大不够。
    技术学习在提高工人的文化，技术水平方面起着重要的作用。但是在这一问题上却还存有很多缺点。不论多么令人惊奇，在我们的工业部门中确没有最低技术知识的统一教学大纲。每一个工厂都按照自己的意思制订自己的大纲。这些教学大纲的不能适应今天向冶金工人所提出的新要求，自然也是不足为奇的。一个读完最低技术课程的工人往往缺乏对几何学的概念。试问他怎样能够进行工作，例如，检查切削槽口的角度呢？现在，把几何、理化的基本知识列入最低技术课程，已经是时候了。重型机器制造业部的各个有关部门应当和重型机器制造业合理化研究所的工作人员们共同拟订一个统一的技术教学大纲。
    依照重型机器制造工业所面临的新任务，各个工厂实验室的作用也更为提高。根据它们工作的意义和性质来说，我们可以毫不夸张地称它们是工厂的科学研究院。除了基本的科学研究和监督工作以外，这些实验室在深刻地研究和综合先进的斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验方面是可以做很多的工作的。
    苏联的重型机器制造业正在稳步地沿着专业化和企业的广泛合作道路前进。目前，当每个部门都面临需要掌握独特技术的任务时，生产合作的意义也就更为增加。很多的新机器的，及时制出大抵依赖于几种企业的协调的和精确的工作。可惜，这一道理还没有被普遍地了解。一些个别工厂经常破坏供应机器枢纽部分和零件的限期，也就妨害了整部机器的装配工作。工厂和车间的职工委员会对于完成邻近各厂的订货工作如果能够组织公共监督，那是切合时宜的。苏联科学和技术的进步
    苏联“真理报”于十月二十九日刊载了列宁格勒加里宁工学院院长阿拉比雪夫的论文，题为“苏联科学和技术的进步”，文中以该学院的实例说明科学工作者和企业合作的重大意义。摘要如下：
    科学工作者和生产者的创造性合作，是技术进步的灵魂，是用以发展祖国技术的取之不竭的泉源。它们两者之间的密切联系，可以帮助科学中的探讨工作，扩大研究的实验基础，并使科学上的发现、发明和改进能迅速运用到生产中去。
    列宁格勒的科学机关和工业企业签订了合作的合同。一些高等技术学校和科学研究院的一切科学研究工作的主题，大都面向生产的需要和技术进步的需要。
    创造性合作产生了科学组织和生产组织互相联系的新形式。创造性合作的结果积极地促成了列宁格勒工业的技术进步。单在一九五一年，就已开始制造几百种新的现代机器、仪器、机床和器具，其中包括强大的透平、发电机、电气机器、光学仪器和机械仪器。在科学家的帮助下，想出了运用高频率电流从事机制金属的先进方法。现在高速金属切削法已在科学上有了确实的根据。此外又想出了关于制造塑胶的更经济的方法。生产中大量地采用了自动化。不断地丰富创造性合作的成果使列宁格勒的机器制造业达到了能够制造最新式的各种复杂机器的水平。
    巩固创造性的合作和对工业的社会主义帮助成为了工学院各科系科学研究活动的基本形式之一。最近，“加里宁”工学院与国内九十四个企业和机关订了合同，进行着一百四十二项关于当前问题的大规模研究工作。
    科学家们表现出爱国主义的主动精神，协助工厂更快地和更好地完成伟大共产主义建设的定货。机器制造学的科系工作人员在斯大林冶金工厂里组织了综合小组以探寻制造复杂的水利透平枢纽。这个小组提出了制造零件的先进方法，这种方法保证了高度生产，同时也显著地提高了制品的质量。目前这个工学院的七十四个科系五百四十名研究员已在从事合作合同上所规定的工作。列宁格勒的五十六个工厂和企业的技术委员会里，都有科学家在办公。工学院学生约七百名也积极参加合作。他们在各科系实验室中进行研究工作，写作具有实际价值和教育价值的毕业论文和学年论文，在生产实习期间并在工厂中进行研究工作。
    与企业订立综合的合同，规定解决一系列的技术问题，促进工厂的技术进步—这是创造性合作的新方式。签订了这样合同的不是一个科系而是许多科系。工学院的十九个科系今年与“基洛夫”工厂签订了一个联合的合同，便是一个例子。还有一些合同规定若干科学研究机关与工厂实行合作以解决具有重大意义的技术问题。
    科学家与产业工人之间的创造性的合作，对工学院的教育工作发生了良好的影响，最新的，实际的工业成就已使教学工作更加丰富，在训练专家方面得到很大的帮助；由于这种合作，专家们对他们所研究的问题的实际方面和理论方面都有了清楚的认识。
    创造性的合作是解决生产的技术进步根本问题的最可靠的方法。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的历史性的决议所规定的重大任务，责成苏联科学家不断地巩固与飞速发展的工业的联系。苏联科学家的任务就是进一步努力巩固科学与生产的创造性的合作，这种合作以实际的经验来丰富科学，并能帮助实际工作者更迅速地解决摆在他们面前的任务。应当更大胆地把科学研究的结果用到实际中去，以便保证在最小限度的消耗人力的情况下，全部国民经济的进一步高涨。
