    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 23rd. According to reports from American news agencies, several newspapers of the Li Seung-man gang revealed a piece of news saying that the American aggressors are negotiating with the Li Seung-man gang, preparing to hand over all prisoners of war in U.S. hands to the Li Seung-man gang, and this negotiation may soon succeed. Some newspapers said that this transfer is currently being handled. This news provides a very clear background for the Koje-do Island massacre on December 14th. The American aggressors are afraid that this news will expose the truth of the Koje-do Island incident and are trying their best to deny it, but this empty denial cannot conceal the new conspiracy of the U.S. side. According to Agence France-Presse, the Minister of Defense of the Li Seung-man puppet government has admitted that "a definite plan is being studied" to have Li Seung-man's puppet army replace the U.S. military in guarding prisoners of war. The American aggressors have already transferred 38,000 prisoners of war to the Li Seung-man gang this year under the guise of "release." We now have witnesses to prove that these prisoners of war were later forced to join the Li Seung-man puppet army. The American aggressors are now attempting to hand over all prisoners of war to the Li Seung-man gang in order to accelerate the realization of Eisenhower's plan of "using Asians to fight Asians." This is obviously to make it easier to force prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder in the war of aggression. The Koje-do Island massacre is one of the results of this new conspiracy by the U.S. side.

    李承晚匪帮报纸透露
    美方要把全部战俘移交李匪帮
    【新华社开城二十三日电】据美国通讯社报道，李承晚匪帮的若干家报纸透露一项消息说，美国侵略者正在和李承晚匪帮进行谈判，准备将美方手中的全部战俘移交给李承晚匪帮，这项谈判不久就可以成功。有的报纸说，这种移交现在正在办理。这个消息为十二月十四日的蜂岩岛大屠杀事件提供了十分清楚的背景。美国侵略者害怕这个消息会暴露出蜂岩岛事件的真相，竭力企图加以否认，但是这种空口否认丝毫掩饰不了美方的新阴谋。据法新社消息，李承晚傀儡政府的国防部长已经承认有“一个确定的计划正在研究中”，以便由李承晚伪军来代替美军看守战俘。美国侵略者在今年已经将三万八千名战俘以“释放”为名移交给了李承晚匪帮，我方现在已握有人证，证明这些战俘后来都被迫参加了李承晚伪军。美国侵略者现在为了加紧实现艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划，竟然企图将全部战俘交给李承晚匪帮，这显然是为了更容易地强迫战俘充当侵略战争的炮灰。蜂岩岛大屠杀事件就是美方这个新阴谋的结果之一。
