    Construction Workers Demand Resolution of Medical Issues
    Suggest Central Ministry of Health Consider Solutions
    To the Editor: I suggest that the Central People's Government Ministry of Health and local health administrative organs immediately address the serious lack of medical institutions and medical personnel for construction workers and at construction sites.
    We are trade union workers. According to our understanding, the most common and urgent demand of construction workers at present is a reasonable solution to their medical treatment for injuries and illnesses. Taking Beijing as an example: there are now more than 100,000 construction workers, and two hundred and several dozen construction sites (not including privately-owned construction companies), but only two hospitals, six clinics, thirty-three medical stations, and twenty-two private entrusted hospitals with very poor medical conditions. Each doctor has to care for an average of three thousand several hundred workers. Obviously, medical conditions are far behind actual needs; and this situation exists in other regions as well. This is why the problem seems particularly serious.
    The workplaces of construction workers are mostly scattered and unfixed. They also often work in wind, rain, and sun. In addition, current food, lodging, and labor safety conditions are not good enough. Therefore, the rate of illness and injury among construction workers is much higher than that of other industrial workers. Still taking Beijing as an example, according to incomplete statistics from six construction units, from May to July, there were a total of four fatal accidents, one thousand eight hundred and sixty work-related injuries, and two hundred and twenty-one cases of work-related injuries requiring more than half a month of leave. Workers at the construction site of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the Beijing Construction Company, half of them suffered from gastroenteritis and other diseases in early July. Of the more than 3,000 workers of the Tsinghua University and other three school construction committees, 454 became ill and 416 were injured from May to August. Obviously, the existing medical institutions and medical personnel cannot bear this medical task; and these medical institutions and medical personnel (including the entrusted private hospitals) are limited by equipment and technical conditions, and cannot treat more serious injuries and illnesses. For example, Chen Minxi, a worker at the construction site of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the Beijing Construction Company, fell into a dry well on September 3 and broke his foot. The construction company's hospital could not treat him, so they took him to hospitals such as Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Peking University Hospital; but these hospitals refused to admit him, on the grounds that "there were no beds." They carried the injured person around the city for five days, went through a lot of trouble, and finally, with the help of the Municipal Health Bureau, barely managed to send him to the Municipal Third Hospital. Similar situations are not accidental phenomena in Beijing.
    The above situation not only directly affects the health of workers, creates a bad influence among the masses of workers, but also inevitably affects the completion of production tasks. Especially next year, when the motherland's large-scale economic construction begins, the number of construction workers in various places will greatly increase. If the lack of medical institutions and medical personnel is not properly resolved, the seriousness of this problem is conceivable. We hope that the central and local health administrative agencies will quickly consider solutions. Jue Min, Lan Xiu
    Editor's Note: The problem raised by readers Jue Min and Lan Xiu is very important. In order to solve this problem, we have conducted research with all parties and hereby put forward the following suggestions for the reference of the Central Ministry of Health and local health administrative organs: First, local health organizations must vigorously help local construction units train on-the-job and off-the-job primary medical personnel, so that they can undertake the task of handling minor injuries, doing a good job in environmental sanitation, and conducting health education for workers; and help construction sites with conditions to establish clinics. Second, in areas where there are no construction site clinics, mobile medical teams for construction sites should be organized to treat work-related injuries and illnesses. Third, local public hospitals should establish entrusted relationships with construction workers as much as possible to be responsible for the treatment of serious injuries and illnesses. Fourth, in places where construction sites are relatively concentrated, construction is carried out for a long time, and appropriate conditions are met, construction worker hospitals should be established as much as possible. These methods are all feasible. If they can be organically combined, the medical conditions of construction workers will be greatly improved.
    It is undeniable that there are many difficulties in solving this problem, the first of which is the lack of medical technicians. However, as long as the health administrative organs establish the idea of serving large-scale economic construction, they should distinguish the priorities of their work and first solve this problem for construction workers. On the one hand, it is necessary to transfer some medical personnel from other positions; on the other hand, we should strengthen the work of uniting and transforming the old Chinese and Western medical personnel and training new medical personnel. We must reasonably solve the legitimate demands of construction workers when large-scale capital construction begins.
    Of course, to completely solve the problem of work-related injuries and illnesses of construction workers, we should also implement the principle of prevention first. Therefore, improving the safety conditions of construction workers, caring about workers' lives, paying attention to environmental sanitation, and strengthening workers' technical education are all very important. We hope that local health administrative organs, trade union organizations, construction companies, and construction units will work hard to reduce the rate of work-related injuries and illnesses among construction workers.
    As far as we know, the Central People's Government Ministry of Health has begun to pay attention to solving the medical problems of construction workers. We hope that they can formulate concrete and effective solutions in the near future so that all localities can follow them.

### 建筑工人要求解决医疗问题  建议中央卫生部考虑解决

    建筑工人要求解决医疗问题
    建议中央卫生部考虑解决
    编辑同志：我建议中央人民政府卫生部及各地卫生行政机关，即速解决建筑工人及建筑工地缺少医疗机构和医务人员的严重情况。
    我们是工会工作者。据我们了解，当前建筑工人最普遍而迫切的要求，是合理解决他们的伤病医疗问题。以北京市为例：现在共有十多万建筑工人，二百数十个工地（不包括私营建筑商的工地）却只有两个医院、六个医务所、三十三个医疗站，以及二十二个医疗条件很差的私立嘱托医院。每个医生平均要照顾三千数百个工人。很明显的，医疗条件是远远落后于实际需要；而这种情况同样存在于其他地区。这就是问题所以显得特别严重的原因。
    建筑工人的工作地点大多很分散且不固定，他们又经常在风吹雨打太阳晒的情况下工作着，再加上目前的食宿和劳动安全条件还不够好，因此，建筑工人的病伤率较其他产业工人大的多。仍以北京市为例，据六个建筑单位的不完全统计，五月至七月间，共发生工亡事故四件，工伤事故一千八百六十件，因工伤休工在半月以上的二百二十一件。北京市建筑公司石景山钢铁厂工地的工人，在七月初有一半人患过肠胃炎等疾病。清华大学等三校建设委员会的三千多工人，在五月至八月间生过病的有四百五十四人，工伤四百一十六人。显然现有的医疗机构和医务人员是负担不了这个医疗任务的；而这些医疗机构和医务人员（包括受嘱托的私立医院在内）又限于设备和技术条件，比较重的伤病都不能治疗。如北京市建筑公司石景山钢铁厂工地的工人陈敏喜，九月三日跌入干井内，摔伤了脚骨。建筑公司的医院治不了，抬他到协和、北大等医院去；但这些医院拒不收留，理由是“没有床位”。他们抬着伤号在市内串了五天，费了很多周折，最后经市卫生局帮助，才勉强送入市立第三医院。类似情况在北京并不是偶然现象。
    上述情况不但直接影响了工人的健康，在工人群众中造成了不良影响，也必然影响到生产任务的完成。特别是在明年，祖国大规模的经济建设开始了，各地建筑工人都将大大增加，医疗机构和医务人员的缺乏问题如不作适当的解决，这个问题的严重性是可想而知的。希望中央及各地卫生行政机构赶紧考虑解决的办法。觉民兰秀
    编者按：读者觉民、兰秀提出的问题很重要。为了解决这个问题，我们曾和各方面进行了研究，特提出以下建议供中央卫生部及各地卫生行政机关参考：一、各地卫生组织必须大力帮助当地各建筑单位训练脱离生产和非脱离生产的初级医疗人员，使他们能够担当处理轻伤，搞好环境卫生和向工人进行卫生教育的任务；并帮助有条件建立医务所的工地，建立工地医务所。二、在没有工地医务所的地区，应组织建筑工地巡回医疗队，治疗工伤疾病。三、各地公立医院，应该尽可能与建筑工人建立嘱托关系，负责治疗重伤、重病。四、在工地比较集中，进行建筑的时间较长，而又具备适当条件的地方，应尽可能地建立建筑工人医院。这几个办法都是可行的。如能把它们有机地配合起来，建筑工人的医疗条件，必会得到很大的改善。
    不可否认，要解决这个问题是有许多困难的，首先是缺乏医疗技术人员。但是，只要卫生行政机关树立了为大规模经济建设服务的思想，就应该分别工作的轻重缓急，首先为建筑工人来解决这个问题。这里一方面有必要从其他岗位上抽调一些医务人员；另一方面应加强团结改造旧有的中西医务人员和培养新医务人员的工作。必须在大规模基本建设开始的时候，合理解决建筑工人的正当要求。
    当然，要彻底解决建筑工人的工伤疾病问题，同样应该贯彻以预防为主的方针。因此，改善建筑工人的保安条件、关心工人生活、注意环境卫生和加强工人技术教育都是非常重要的。我们希望各地卫生行政机关、工会组织、建筑公司和施工等单位为减低建筑工人的工伤和疾病率而努力。
    据我们所知，中央人民政府卫生部已经开始注意解决建筑工人的医疗问题。希望他们能够在最近拟出具体而有效的解决方针和办法来，以便各地遵照办理。
