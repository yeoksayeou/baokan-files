    Should Manufacture Rubber Shoes Suitable for Farmers' Needs
    Comrade Editor: The lives of the working people have improved since Liberation. In the past one or two years, many rubber shoes have been sold in rural areas. However, most farmers' feet are both wide and thick, while the rubber shoes produced by various factories now are all slim and long. When farmers buy rubber shoes, they have to choose larger sizes. But when wearing large shoes, the front end is empty, and the instep is still very tight. This will shorten the lifespan of the rubber shoes. Therefore, I suggest that factories manufacturing rubber shoes produce a large batch of rubber shoes according to the shape of farmers' feet. This will not only extend the lifespan of the rubber shoes but also save a lot of raw materials.

    Editor's Note: The Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government believes that Comrade Wang Jinggong's suggestion is reasonable. Shoe lasts of the same size should have several different widths to meet the needs of different people. The ministry has separately notified the Municipal Bureaus of Industry and Commerce of Shenyang, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Qingdao, the Shandong Rubber General Factory, the Northeast Light Industry Administration Bureau, and the Tianjin Local State-Owned Industry Bureau, asking them to inform all rubber shoe manufacturers to refer to and improve.

    应该制造适合农民需要的胶鞋
    编辑同志：解放后劳动人民的生活提高了。近一、二年来，在农村中销售的胶鞋很多。但农民的脚大部又宽又厚，而现在各厂出品的胶鞋都是瘦长式的。农民买胶鞋时只得拣较大的买。但大鞋穿在脚上，前端空着，脚面仍然很紧。这样会使胶鞋缩短穿着年限。因此，我建议制造胶鞋的工厂，按照农民的脚样，制造一大批胶鞋。这样不但可以延长胶鞋的穿着年限，还可以节省很多原料。
    王景贡
    编者按：中央人民政府轻工业部认为王景贡同志所提建议是合理的。同一号码的鞋楦，应有几种不同的宽度，以适应不同对象的需要。该部已分别通知沈阳、天津、上海、广州、北京、青岛各市工商局，山东橡胶总厂，东北轻工业管理局以及天津地方国营工业局，请他们转知各胶鞋制造厂参考改进。
