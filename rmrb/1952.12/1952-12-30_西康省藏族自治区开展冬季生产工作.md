Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Before and after the freeze, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province have been working hard to carry out winter agricultural production activities in order to welcome the large-scale patriotic agricultural bumper harvest movement next year. In this area, from the Jinsha River in the west to the Dadu River in the east, the cultivated land has generally been plowed once or twice, and the various fertilizers accumulated in various places are half to one times more than last year; more than 10,000 mu of wasteland have been newly reclaimed in the entire region. Before and after the autumn harvest this year, the people's governments of most districts and townships in the region convened meetings of labor models and representatives of people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life to summarize and exchange production experiences in the patriotic production increase movement, and formulated winter patriotic production plans. Subsequently, the people's governments of various counties sent work teams to the countryside to cooperate with local labor models to guide and assist farmers in selecting seeds, plowing winter land, accumulating fertilizer and other preparatory work, and widely publicized the people's government's policies to encourage production to farmers, and introduced advanced production experiences from various places. Many farmers have already formulated family winter patriotic production plans, and used the surplus grain from this year's bumper harvest to purchase agricultural tools and cattle. Zekalong Village in Yidun County alone purchased more than 60 cattle and horses. Many farmers who had never plowed winter land in the past carried out winter plowing for the first time this year. The seeds of farmers in Yajiang County have been selected in the fields, ears, and grains. Farmers in Batang, Yidun and other counties, which have a shorter freezing period and sow two seasons a year, are busily transporting fertilizer to the fields. The first batch of 53,000 pieces of iron farm tools and complete sets of new farm tools ordered by the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government in Chongqing, Chengdu, Ya'an and other places are now being transported to various counties along the Sichuan-Kang highway, Kang-Tibet highway and the region's post roads.

    西康省藏族自治区开展冬季生产工作
    西康省藏族自治区各族农民在冰冻前后，已紧张地展开了冬季农业生产活动，以迎接明年大规模的农业爱国丰产运动。该区西起金沙江东迄大渡河，耕地已普遍犁过一遍到两遍，各地已积的各种肥料比去年多一半到一倍；全区新开垦的荒地有上万亩。今年秋收前后，全区大部区、乡人民政府便召开了劳动模范会议和各族各界人民代表会议，总结和交流爱国增产运动中的生产经验，制订了冬季爱国生产计划。接着，各县人民政府即派工作队下乡，配合当地劳动模范指导和帮助农民进行选种，翻冬地、积肥等准备工作，并向农民广泛宣传人民政府奖励生产的政策，介绍各地先进的生产经验。许多农民已订出家庭冬季爱国生产计划，并把今年丰收的余粮添购了农具和耕牛，单义敦县则卡龙村就添购了牛、马六十多头。许多过去从不翻冬地的农民今年第一次进行了冬耕。雅江县农民的种籽都经过田选、穗选、粒选。冰冻期较短、每年下种两季的巴塘、义敦等县农民，正紧张地把肥料运到地里。藏族自治区人民政府在重庆、成都、雅安等地订制的一九五三年第一批铁器农具和全套新式农具五万三千多件，现正沿川康公路、康藏公路及该区驿道源源运往各县。　（据新华社讯）
