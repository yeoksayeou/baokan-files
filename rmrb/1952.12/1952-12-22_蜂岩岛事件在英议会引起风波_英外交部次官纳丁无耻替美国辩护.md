Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: The bloody atrocity of the American side's mass slaughter of prisoners of war on Beehive Island has shocked the world and aroused great indignation among the people of all countries. This has alarmed the British ruling class, the accomplices of the United States, and caused an uproar in the British Parliament.
    According to a Reuters report: On the 17th, in the British House of Commons, "Labour MP Leslie Hale asked to know the details of the disturbance. He said: It is unprecedented for guards to shoot people who are arm-in-arm singing with machine guns. He said: This kind of incident will create an intolerable situation that may affect our efforts in Asia." Because the United States has repeatedly made a fool of itself on the issue of prisoners of war and is doing its best to block its British accomplices from obtaining any information, former Labour cabinet minister Philip Noel-Baker euphemistically expressed his dissatisfaction with the United States in Parliament, saying, "Because several such incidents have occurred in the past, a wider sharing and control of prisoner-of-war camps by various countries fighting in Korea would be a much more satisfactory approach for all parties concerned, especially the United States." Former Labour Air Minister Henderson proposed that the British government request the U.S. government to allow "officers from other countries" to participate in the so-called "investigation committee." Another Labour MP, Tom Driberg, expressed dissatisfaction with the British government's "request to the House of Commons to withhold their opinions until detailed information is obtained." He said that the government had said this before, "but such information never followed."
    Amidst a chorus of inquiries in the House of Commons, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Nutting shamelessly defended the crimes of the American aggressors in slaughtering prisoners of war on Beehive Island. Although even Beehive Island prisoner-of-war camp commander Miller had admitted that the prisoners of war were slaughtered because they used singing to oppose forced detention, and although Nutting himself admitted that he had not yet received a report on the incident from his master, the U.S. State Department, he brazenly lied and publicly said that the massacre occurred because "three thousand six hundred fanatical communists, blatantly ignoring orders and warning shots, attacked the guards, who were far fewer in number than them, with makeshift weapons." But this "attack" resulted in 87 prisoners of war being killed and more than 200 injured, while only two American guards were slightly injured. Does this not fully prove that this "attack" was a planned arrangement by the United States? Nutting then went on to defend his master in an extremely shameless and cruel manner, saying, "I thought the use of force was unavoidable." Nutting even went so far as to distort the Geneva Convention, saying that shooting people arm-in-arm singing with machine guns was in accordance with Article 42 of the Geneva Convention!
    When Nutting told this lie, he had obviously exerted the maximum imagination of his brain, which was specially used to receive American instructions. But when the lies about the prisoners of war "rioting" and "escaping" have been exposed by the executioners themselves, Nutting's sophistry only reveals the stupidity and servility of the British government.

### 蜂岩岛事件在英议会引起风波  英外交部次官纳丁无耻替美国辩护

    蜂岩岛事件在英议会引起风波
    英外交部次官纳丁无耻替美国辩护
    【新华社二十一日讯】美方在蜂岩岛上大批屠杀战俘的血腥暴行震动了全世界，引起了各国人民极大的愤怒，这使美国的帮凶英国统治阶级感到惊惶失措，在英国议会里已经引起了风波。
    据路透社消息：十七日，在英国下院中，“工党议员莱斯利·赫尔要求知道这次骚动的详情。他说：卫兵竟用机关枪射击挽着臂唱歌的人，这是史无前例的。他说：这种事件会造成一种不能容忍的情势，那可能影响我们在亚洲各地的努力。”由于美国在战俘问题上一再出丑，而又极力封锁他们的英国帮凶，不让他们得到任何情况，前工党内阁大臣菲利浦·诺尔—贝克在议会委婉地表示其对美国的不满说，“因为过去已经发生了好几起这类事件，所以让在朝鲜作战的各国比较广泛地分担和控制战俘营的责任，对于有关各方面特别是美国，将是一种令人满意得多的办法”。前工党空军大臣汉德逊提出要英国政府请求美国政府允许“其他国家的军官”参加所谓“调查委员会”。另一个工党议员汤姆·德里斯伯格对于英国政府“要求下院在未获悉详细的情报以前保留他们的意见”一事表示不满。他说，政府以前也曾经这样说，“但是这种情报以后就从来没有下文”。
    在下院一片质询声中，英国外交部次官纳丁无耻地替美国侵略者在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘的罪行进行辩护。虽然连蜂岩岛战俘营司令米勒都已经承认，战俘之所以遭受屠杀，是因为他们用唱歌来反对强迫扣留，虽然纳丁自己也承认他还没有得到他的主子美国国务院给他的关于这个事件的报告，可是他竟然闭着眼睛公开撒谎说，屠杀事件之所以发生，是因为“三千六百名狂热的共产党人，悍然不听命令及警告的枪声，以临时拼凑的武器向比他们人数少得多的卫兵进攻”。但是这种“进攻”却使战俘八十七人被杀，一共死伤二百余人，而美国的卫兵却仅仅轻伤二人，这还不充分证明这种进攻是美国有计划地布置的吗？纳丁接着又极端无耻而残忍地给他的主子辩护说，“我以为使用武力是不可避免的。”纳丁甚至不惜曲解日内瓦公约，说用机关枪扫射挽着手臂唱歌的人，是合乎日内瓦公约第四十二条的规定的！
    纳丁在撒这个谎的时候，显然已经发挥了他那专门用来接受美国指示的头脑的最大限度的想像力。可是在关于战俘“暴动”、“逃跑”的谎话已经被刽子手自己揭穿了的时候，纳丁的这种狡辩，只是暴露了英国政府的愚蠢和奴颜婢膝罢了。
