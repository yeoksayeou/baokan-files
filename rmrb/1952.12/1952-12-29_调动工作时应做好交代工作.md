    Proper Handover of Work When Transferring Jobs
    Comrade Editor: I joined the revolution in 1950 and have been working for nearly three years. During this time, I have been transferred five times. Every time I was transferred, I had the same feeling: when accepting new work, some comrades do not explain the work clearly, but simply gloss over the "objective reasons" without explaining the basic situation. For example, when I took over the work of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Liaozhong County Federation of Trade Unions in Liaoxi Province, I asked the comrade who was handing over the work: Who are the cultural and educational committee members of the grassroots trade unions and the chairpersons at all levels of the workers' night schools? What is the ideological situation of the workers? What work has been done and how to continue it, and the number of documents? He didn't know all of these things completely, but only explained some phenomena. Another example is when I recently took over the work of the Liaozhong County Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Originally, after the reorganization of various institutions in July this year, there was no established position for full-time cadres of the County Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the work was handed over to the Propaganda Department of the Liaozhong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This time when I took over this work, I didn't know how many branches there were in the county, who the cadres were, etc., and there was no handover document. There are many things I don't know how to handle, and I want to ask the original person in charge, but I don't know where they went. Until now, I am still completely in the dark. In short, every time I take over a job, I don't know where to start. This will at least limit the work, or even create difficulties. Of course, revolutionary cadres are not afraid of difficulties, but this phenomenon should not exist.
    I believe that the reason for this phenomenon is that some comrades do not have a strong sense of revolutionary cause. They are not responsible enough in the handover of work, thinking
    "it's nothing," "I won't do it anymore, it has nothing to do with me in the future." Some comrades deal with the handover work with a selfish attitude. Perhaps they are afraid that others will do the work well, exposing their shortcomings in the work or the lack of achievements; or because they were disciplined and transferred, they are not "satisfied" and perfunctorily hand over the work. Another reason is that because they are leaving "urgently," they hand over the work to others temporarily before the new person arrives, so they don't know what's going on when handing over the work.
    I suggest that the comrades who are handing over the work, especially the relevant leaders, should pay attention to the handover work in the future. See if the handover is thorough? What problems are there? Can the comrade who is taking over the work continue the work in a timely manner? Of course, the comrades who are taking over the work should also ask clearly about the key issues in the work and the future direction of the work.　Wang Chunshu

### 调动工作时应做好交代工作

    调动工作时应做好交代工作
    编辑同志：我是一九五○年参加革命工作的，到现在将近三年。这当中我曾经被调动工作五次。每次调动工作我都有同样的一个感觉：即接受新的工作时，有的同志交代工作不清楚，只是囫囵吞枣地拉些“客观原因”，没把基本情况交代出来。如我在接辽西省辽中县总工会文教部的工作时，我问交代的同志：基层工会文教委员、工人夜校的各级主席是谁？工人思想情况如何？当前做了那些工作、怎样继续下去以及文件数量等，他都不完全知道，而只交代一些现象。再如最近一次我接辽中县中苏友好协会工作时也如此。本来今年七月各机构整编后，县中苏友好协会的专职干部的编制没有了，而工作是交给中共辽中县委宣传部做的。这次我接这工作时，全县多少支会、干部是谁等等，都不知道，也没有移交书。有许多东西不知怎样处理，想找原负责人问问，也不知其去向。直到现在，我仍然黑漆一团。总之，我每接一个工作后，都有不知从何作起的情况。这样起码要使工作受到限制，甚或有困难。当然革命干部不怕困难，但这种现象是不应该有的。
    我体会这种现象产生的原因，在于某些同志的革命事业心不强。他们在交代工作中不够负责，以为
    “没啥”，“我不作了，今后与我无关”。有的同志以一种自私的心情对付交代工作。他也许惟恐别人把工作做好了，显露了他工作中的缺点或工作没成绩；又或是因为被处分而调动工作的，即不“称心”，交代时敷衍了事。再有一种，因为走得“急迫”，没等到新接工作的来，就把工作暂交给别人，以致交代时搞不清楚。
    我建议交代工作的同志们，特别是有关的领导同志，今后应注意交代工作。看交代彻底了没有？里面有什么问题？接工作的同志能否及时把工作继续下去？当然接工作的同志，也要问清工作中的关键问题以及今后工作的方向等。　汪纯恕
