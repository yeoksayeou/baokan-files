    I Want to Be a Good Zhuang Child

    Comrade Editor: I am a Zhuang child from Guixi, Guangxi Province. I was very happy to hear the news of the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I was always discriminated against and did not dare to admit that I was "Zhuang." After liberation, some comrades came here to talk about Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, saying that I was "Zhuang." I unconsciously replied: "Why do you talk nonsense that I am Zhuang!" I thought it was "shameful" to say that I was "Zhuang." Later, I saw reports about the Zhuang people in the newspaper, saying that the Zhuang people and other ethnic groups were fraternal ethnic groups, and my thinking changed. Now I feel that being a Zhuang child in the era of Chairman Mao is as glorious and happy as children of other ethnic groups. Every Zhuang compatriot, every Zhuang child, supports the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government. In the future, I will definitely be a good Zhuang child, listen carefully to Chairman Mao's words, study hard, and exercise.

    我要做一个好的僮族儿童
    编辑同志：我是广西省桂西的一个僮族儿童。听到桂西僮族自治区人民政府成立的消息，我心里非常喜欢。过去，在国民党反动派统治下，我一直受到歧视，也不敢承认自己是“僮族”。解放后，有同志到我们这里讲毛主席的民族政策，说我是“僮族”，我还不知不觉地回答：“为什么你乱说我是僮族呢！”我认为，讲自己是“僮族”，很“可耻”。后来，我看到报上不断地登着僮族的事，说僮族和其他族是兄弟民族，我的思想才转过来。现在我感到，做毛主席时代的一个僮族儿童，和其他族的儿童是一样的光荣，幸福。我们每一个僮族同胞，每一个僮族儿童，都拥护桂西僮族自治区人民政府的成立。今后，我一定做一个僮族的好儿童，好好听毛主席的话，努力学习，锻炼身体。
