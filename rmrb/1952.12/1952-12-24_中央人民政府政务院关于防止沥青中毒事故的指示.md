According to reports from various regions, asphalt poisoning accidents occur frequently, with those occurring during the transport of asphalt being the most serious. Chronic poisoning among workers in departments that produce and use asphalt is also quite common. The "Several Measures Concerning the Transport of Dangerous Goods" promulgated by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government on October 9, 1951, has played a certain role in preventing general transport poisoning accidents; however, due to insufficient attention to this issue by some regions and relevant departments, it has not been well implemented. At the same time, the measures lack specific provisions for preventing asphalt poisoning, resulting in the continued occurrence of asphalt poisoning accidents during transport.

The main reasons for asphalt poisoning among workers are poor asphalt packaging, insufficient protective equipment and sanitation facilities for workers, and neglect of regular safety education for workers. This situation is detrimental to the safety and health of workers and to production work, and must be promptly corrected and improved.

In order to more effectively prevent asphalt poisoning and protect the safety and health of workers producing, loading, unloading, transporting, and using asphalt, in addition to instructing the Central Heavy Industry Ministry to issue a circular to its asphalt-producing factories and mines to earnestly improve asphalt packaging before the end of 1952, the "Measures for Preventing Asphalt Poisoning" drafted by the Central Ministry of Labor is hereby approved for implementation. All relevant units must conscientiously implement it. Labor administrative departments at all levels should supervise and inspect at any time. Enterprises and individuals who violate these measures and related laws and regulations, causing poisoning accidents, must be held accountable. Serious cases should be transferred to supervisory authorities or people's courts at all levels for punishment in accordance with the law.

    中央人民政府政务院关于防止沥青中毒事故的指示
    根据各地报告，沥青中毒事故经常发生，其中尤以搬运沥青中毒最为严重。在生产和使用沥青的部门内，工人的慢性中毒现象，亦颇不少。一九五一年十月九日中央人民政府劳动部公布的“关于搬运危险性物品的几项办法”，对于防止一般搬运中毒事故，是起了一定的作用的；但因某些地区和有关部门对这一问题重视不足，没有很好地贯彻执行，同时该办法中对于防止沥青中毒的方法亦缺少具体规定，以致搬运沥青中毒事故依然不断发生。
    造成工人沥青中毒的原因，主要是由于沥青的包装不良，供工人使用的防护用品和卫生设备不够，以及忽视对工人进行经常的安全教育。这种情况，既有害于工人的安全健康，又有害于生产工作，必须迅速予以纠正和改进。
    为了更有效地防止沥青中毒，保障生产、装卸、搬运和使用沥青的工人的安全健康，除责成中央重工业部通令所属生产沥青的厂矿于一九五二年底以前切实改善沥青包装外，特批准中央劳动部拟定的“关于防止沥青中毒的办法”，公布实施，所有有关单位务须认真执行。各级劳动行政部门应随时督促检查，对于违犯此项办法及有关法令造成中毒事故的企业单位和人员，必须追究责任，情节严重者应转送各级监察机关或人民法院依法予以处分。
    总理  周恩来
    一九五二年十二月十七日
