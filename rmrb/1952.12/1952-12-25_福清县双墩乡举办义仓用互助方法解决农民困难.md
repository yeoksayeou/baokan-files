    Shuangdun Township, Fuqing County, Establishes Community Granary and Uses Mutual Aid to Solve Farmers' Difficulties

    Editor: Farmers in Shuangdun Township, Fuqing County, Fujian Province, practice thrift and savings and have established a community granary. This has played a good role in organizing farmers to solve difficulties in production and life through mutual aid.

    After liberation, following land reform and the patriotic production increase campaign, the lives of farmers in Shuangdun Township have gradually improved. In order to ensure that farmers do not lack funds for production and to solve difficulties during the lean season and other difficulties, after the bumper harvest of summer crops this year, the Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fuqing County, according to instructions from higher authorities and the demands of the masses, called on farmers in the township to practice thrift and savings and establish a community granary. Farmers responded enthusiastically to this call. On a voluntary basis, a total of 286 households in the township joined the community granary, accumulating more than 8,300 jin of dried grain. The farmers who joined the community granary also elected a community granary management committee.

    In early October, some farmers in the township lacked rations and wheat seeds. The community granary management committee convened a meeting of community granary representatives. After careful discussion and review, more than 7,600 jin of dried grain were loaned out, solving the production and living difficulties of 92 households. The wife of poor farmer Lin Xiangtian had a difficult labor and needed surgery but had no money; he borrowed 300 jin of grain from the community granary, which allowed him to hire a doctor to perform the surgery, and both mother and child were safe and sound. Lin Xiangtian said with emotion, "It's really good that the Communist Party and the People's Government led us to establish a community granary, saving the lives of both my wife and child." Farmer Xu Juhua's wife had no rations after giving birth, so the community granary committee lent him 50 jin of grain, solving his family's living difficulties. He said to everyone he met, "In the past, when I had no rations, I borrowed high-interest loans from the landlord, and as a result, I sold three mu of land and worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for eight years. Now that I have turned over and received land, the government is leading us to establish a community granary to help us overcome difficulties."

    Now, the people of the whole township universally recognize the benefits of saving and establishing a community granary, and many who did not join the community granary in the past have also applied to join. The Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fuqing County has summarized the experience of Shuangdun Township and is preparing to universally establish community granaries in various townships after the autumn harvest.

    Editor's Note: The method of mobilizing the masses to save grain and establish a community granary on the basis of voluntary participation is good. Doing so is not only conducive to saving, but more importantly, it promotes the spirit of mutual assistance among farmers. Here, it must also be pointed out that the management of the community granary must adhere to the principle of democracy. Since the community granary is established for the benefit of everyone, through everyone's grain storage, any violation of voluntary and democratic practices will produce adverse results. We suggest that areas with the conditions can promote the establishment of community granaries.

    福清县双墩乡举办义仓用互助方法解决农民困难
    编辑同志：福建省福清县双墩乡农民厉行节约储蓄，举办义仓。这对组织农民用互助方法解决生产和生活上的困难，起了良好的作用。
    解放后，经过土地改革和爱国丰产运动，双墩乡农民的生活已逐渐改善。为了保证农民们生产时不缺资金并解决青黄不接时的困难和其他的困难，在今年夏季农作物丰收后，中共福清县五区区委根据上级指示和群众的要求，号召该乡农民厉行节约储蓄，举办义仓。农民纷纷响应这一号召。在自愿的原则下，全乡共有二百八十六户加入了义仓，共积干谷八千三百多斤。加入义仓的农民们并选出了义仓管理委员会。
    十月上旬，乡里有些农民缺口粮和麦种。义仓管理委员会就召开了义仓代表会议，经过认真的讨论和审查，贷放了干谷七千六百多斤，解决了九十二户农民生产和生活上的困难。贫农林祥添的妻子难产，要动手术没有钱；他贷得义仓粮三百斤，就请医生来动了手术，母子两人都很平安。林祥添感动地说：“共产党、人民政府领导我们办义仓真是好，救了我家大小两口人。”农民许菊花的妻子生下小孩后没有口粮，义仓委员会就贷给他五十斤谷，解决了他家生活的困难。他遇见人便说：“过去我没口粮，借过地主的高利贷，结果是卖掉三亩田，还给地主当了八年长工。现在翻身分田后，政府又领导办义仓，帮助我们度过了困难。”
    现在全乡人民普遍地认识到了节约储蓄、举办义仓的好处，很多过去没加入义仓的也纷纷申请加入。中共福清县五区区委总结了双墩乡的经验，准备在秋季丰收的各乡普遍举办义仓。缪鸿昌
    编者按：在群众自愿的基础上，发动群众节约储粮，举办义仓的办法是好的。这样做，不仅有利于节约，更重要的是，发扬了农民的互助精神。这里，还必须指出：在义仓的管理上，一定要遵守民主的原则。义仓既然是为了大家的利益，由大家积储粮食而举办的，因此，任何违反自愿和民主的做法，都会产生不良的结果。我们建议有条件的地区，都可以提倡举办义仓。
