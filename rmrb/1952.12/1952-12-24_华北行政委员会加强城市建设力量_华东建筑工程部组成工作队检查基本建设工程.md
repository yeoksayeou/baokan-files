    The North China Administrative Council of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council convened the North China Construction Engineering Conference in Beijing from December 1st to 10th to discuss construction engineering work and urban construction work. In terms of urban construction work, the meeting decided to strengthen urban construction forces and improve urban construction institutions. The meeting also studied urban construction plans and designs for next year. In terms of construction engineering work, the meeting decided to take many concrete measures to increase the strength of construction engineering. First, establish unified construction engineering institutions and leadership relationships. The people's governments of all provinces and cities should quickly establish construction engineering bureaus. Second, it is necessary to increase design and construction forces. In addition to appropriately concentrating and rationally using existing design personnel, a portion of personnel should be drawn from construction departments and factory and mining production departments to participate in design work; and short-term crash training courses should be held to train design talent in large numbers. To save design resources, the meeting decided to use the already prepared four categories and twenty-four types of standard design drawings for 40 percent of construction projects. The solution to the problem of construction strength is mainly to select experienced workers from construction departments to serve as cadres to strengthen construction institutions, and to rank projects and concentrate forces to do a good job in major projects. The North China region plans to train more than 50,000 workers and cadres this winter. Through winter training, the organizational and technical level of construction workers will be further improved, and some workers will be promoted to cadres. In addition, it is necessary to carry out the work of clearing assets and verifying funds, clarifying the base, establishing systems, and achieving enterprise management. The meeting required all localities to do all the preparatory work for next year's construction this winter, such as formulating project progress plans and material supply plans, organizing transportation forces, and deploying workers.
    In addition, the East China Construction Engineering Department, in order to understand the current shortcomings in basic construction projects, improve future work, and better complete the basic construction tasks for next year, has specially selected nearly 100 cadres with considerable professional and technical and political levels from the department and various construction units to form an inspection work team, which began on the 12th of this month to conduct focused inspections of construction management, transportation, and other conditions at construction sites. Responsible cadres of various construction units, in order to assist this work, have taken the initiative to cooperate with the work team to formulate inspection work procedures and have mobilized employees.

    华北行政委员会加强城市建设力量
    华东建筑工程部组成工作队检查基本建设工程
    中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会在十二月一日至十日在北京召开华北建筑工程会议，讨论了建筑工程工作和城市建设工作。在城市建设工作方面，会议决定加强城市建设力量，健全城市建设的机构。会议并研究了明年城市建设的计划、设计等问题。在建筑工程工作方面，会议决定采取许多具体措施，来增长建筑工程的力量。首先，建立统一的建筑工程机构和领导关系。各省、市人民政府迅速建立建筑工程局。其次，要增长设计和施工力量。除了适当集中和合理使用现有设计人员外，从施工部门和厂矿生产部门中再抽调一部分人员参加设计工作；并举办短期速成训练班，大批训练设计人才。为节省设计力量，会议决定在百分之四十的建筑工程上，使用已经拟制好的四类二十四种标准设计图。解决施工力量问题，主要是从施工部门中选拔有经验的工人担任干部，充实施工机构，并进行工程排队，集中力量做好主要工程。华北全区计划在今年冬季训练五万多名工人和干部。通过冬季训练，进一步提高建筑工人的组织性和技术水平，并从中提拔一部分工人为干部。此外，要进行清理资产核定资金的工作，弄清家底，建立制度，做到经营企业化。会议要求各地在今年冬季做好明年施工的一切准备工作，如制订工程进度计划和材料供应计划，组织运输力量，调配工人等。
    又讯：华东建筑工程部为了了解目前基本建设工程中的缺点，改进今后工作，以便更好地完成明年度的基本建设任务，特从该部和各施工单位抽调具有相当业务技术和政治水平的干部近百人，组成检查工作队，自本月十二日开始有重点地深入工地检查施工管理、运输等情况。各施工单位的负责干部，为协助这一工作，都主动地配合工作队订出检查工作程序，并向职工进行了动员。
