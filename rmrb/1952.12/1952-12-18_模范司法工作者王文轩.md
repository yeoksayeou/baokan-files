    Model Judicial Worker Wang Wenxuan
    Chen Yichao
    Wang Wenxuan, the president of the Kaifeng County People's Court in Henan Province, is a model judicial worker in the Zhengzhou Special District.

    Wang Wenxuan worked in the township and district governments for seven years. In 1950, he was transferred to take charge of the work of the Kaifeng County People's Court. At that time, he felt that he had a low level of education and did not understand the law, so he could not do it. After participating in the rectification study at the Party School and the judicial work conference held by the Henan Provincial People's Court, he realized the importance of the people's judicial work entrusted to him by the Party, and he was determined to do a good job in judicial work. But how to do it? He was still unsure. He felt that the criminals were very good at arguing, and he was from a peasant background and was clumsy, so he was always afraid to try cases. The leading comrades told him that he could only quickly learn this set of skills by personally participating in the trial. He accepted the instructions of the leading comrades and began the trial work.

    In the first few trials Wang Wenxuan conducted, because he could not grasp the main key to the problem, he often caused the criminals to complain to him. But he was not overwhelmed by these difficulties. On the one hand, he audited the trials of others, and on the other hand, he diligently studied judicial documents and case files approved by higher authorities, often staying up late into the night. In this way, he gradually mastered the trial methods. However, he still had doubts about following the mass line in handling cases. He felt that the work of the court was very complicated, and it was not easy to follow the mass line. At the same time, he also considered that the court had a large backlog of cases when suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and a backlog of cases for a long time would affect the government's prestige among the masses. Moreover, the higher authorities also instructed to follow the mass line. After repeated deliberation and discussion with other comrades, Wang Wenxuan decided to try it out first. The results of relying on the masses to handle cases were beyond his expectations. During the trial of counter-revolutionary Sun Shutang, the criminal flatly denied his crimes. Wang Wenxuan then took the case to the countryside and announced the policy at a mass meeting, explaining the process of handling the case. As a result, both the witness and physical evidence were found among the masses. When the criminal saw the peasant Zhao Wenming appearing in court to testify, he said, "No need to testify, I admit it." This case was quickly resolved. Wang Wenxuan and four cadres relied on the masses to handle 164 cases in fifteen days.

    Wang Wenxuan grasped this rule, and often consulted with the masses and listened to their opinions when handling cases. He was no longer afraid of criminals denying their crimes. Once, when it was decided to execute Wang Jingxu, a murderer from Zhang Village in the county, he heard that the masses in Mapizhuang in the county said that the court's materials were not accurate. He personally went to several villages around Zhang Village for a two-day investigation, and finally understood the truth of the matter, found the witnesses, and correctly handled the case, which was praised by the masses. After Wang Wenxuan became the president, he learned that the masses in Matou Township of the county had many opinions on the three-year imprisonment sentence imposed on habitual bandit Tian Sheng by the former president. Wang Wenxuan learned from past cases that Tian Sheng had thirteen lives on his hands, so he personally went to Matou Township to collect the opinions of the masses and submitted a request to the higher authorities for a retrial. As a result, Tian Sheng was sentenced to death and executed. Later, he also checked out fourteen cases of heavy crimes being lightly sentenced in the past, and all of them were retried, which the people were very satisfied with.

    Comrade Wang Wenxuan is very cautious in dealing with cases. When trial judge Peng Weiyan reported to him a case of sentencing Jiang Hongxin to death, he thought repeatedly overnight: Why would Jiang Hongxin admit to the charges made by the plaintiff without any hesitation during the interrogation, as reported? The next day, when he and the trial judge jointly reviewed the case, they found that many places in the report heard the night before were one-sided statements from the plaintiff. Wang Wenxuan then asked Peng Weiyan to take the case file back to the countryside for on-site interrogation for the second time. As a result of Peng Weiyan's joint interrogation with the masses, the actual situation was very different from what the plaintiff had alleged. In the end, Jiang Hongxin was sentenced to five years in prison. When Wang Wenxuan was dealing with the case of Zhou Shunhe, a farmer in Daguantou Township of the county, who injured his brother, some cadres and people in the district and township demanded that Zhou Shunhe be sentenced to imprisonment. However, Wang Wenxuan felt that the brothers Zhou Shunhe had a very good relationship in the past, and they fought due to a momentary impulse. It was enough to just educate Zhou Shunhe to apologize to his brother and pay for medical expenses. In this way, the brothers could reconcile and production would not be delayed. After he got through the thoughts of the cadres and the masses, he handled it this way. As a result, the Zhou Shunhe brothers did reconcile. One night, the Third District People's Government called and said that a farmer was found killed in a field in Matou Township. Wang Wenxuan immediately took a bailiff and walked fifty miles overnight to the scene to investigate. After two days of in-depth understanding and discussion with the masses, it was learned that the farmer was not killed, but committed suicide.

    A young couple went to the court to file for divorce. The man's name was Sun Benyi, and the woman's name was Li Xiurong. The man did not agree to the divorce, and the woman insisted that their relationship was not good, but could not say that the other party had abused her. The woman also said:
    "If I don't get a divorce, it means I lost the case." Wang Wenxuan felt that there must be other problems in it. The next day, he sent someone to take the case to the countryside for investigation. After investigation, it was learned that the problem was caused by Sun Benyi's mother and sister hindering their couple from living together. After criticizing Sun's mother and sister, the three mothers and daughters all admitted their mistakes. Sun and Li's couple also reconciled.

    Wang Wenxuan's style of going deep among the masses has changed the old style of "sitting in court and questioning cases" of the Kaifeng County People's Court in the past. Whenever there is a doubtful case, the cadres of the court automatically take the case to the countryside for in-depth investigation. Sometimes, when it is late and farmers come to file complaints, Wang Wenxuan personally or sends someone to help them solve the problem of accommodation and food.

    Wang Wenxuan himself lives a very simple life. He wore a pair of shoes for one year and seven months, patched them twice, and was reluctant to throw them away. When comrades are emotional and do not work well, he always patiently helps them and inspires them. Therefore, the cadres of the Kaifeng County People's Court not only regard him as a leader, but also regard him as their closest friend.

    模范司法工作者王文轩
    陈一超
    河南省开封县人民法院院长王文轩是郑州专区的模范司法工作者。
    王文轩做过七年的乡、区政府工作，一九五零年，被调负责开封县人民法院工作。当时他觉得自己文化很低，又不懂法律，干不了。参加了党校整风学习和河南省人民法院召开的司法工作会议以后，他认识了党所交给他的人民司法工作的重要，就决心要做好司法工作。但怎么做呢？心里还没有底。他觉得犯人都很会狡辩，自己是农民出身，嘴又笨，老不敢审判案件。领导同志告诉他，只有亲身参加审讯，才能很快地学会这套业务。他接受领导同志的指示，就开始了审讯工作。
    王文轩在开始审讯的几次，因为抓不住问题的主要关键，常弄得犯人向他诉“苦”。但他没有被这些困难难倒。他一方面旁听别人的审讯，一方面辛勤地钻研司法文件和上级批过的案卷，经常到深夜不睡。就这样，他逐渐掌握了审讯方法。但对处理案件中走群众路线还有疑虑。他觉得法院工作很复杂，走群众路线不容易。他同时又考虑到：法院在镇压反革命时积案很多，积案压久了，又会影响政府在群众中的威信。而且，上级也指示要走群众路线。王文轩经过反复的思索，又和其他同志研究过以后，就决定先做一做看。依靠群众办案的成绩，出乎他意料之外。在审讯反革命分子孙书堂时，该犯曾矢口否认自己的罪行。王文轩便带案下乡，在群众大会上宣布了政策，讲明处理案件的经过，结果人证物证都从群众中找到了。该犯见农民赵文明出庭作证时，便说“不要证了，我承认了”。这案很快得到解决。王文轩和四个干部依靠群众在十五天内，处理案件一百六十四起。
    王文轩抓住了这个规律，处理案件时时常和群众商量，听取群众意见，再不怕犯人狡赖不承认了。有一次决定处决该县张庄的杀人犯王景绪时，他听到该县马皮庄的群众说法院的材料不确实，便亲自跑到张庄周围几个村子进行了两天的调查，终于了解了事情真象，找出了见证人，正确处理了这一案件，得到群众赞许。王文轩做院长后，知道了该县马头乡群众对前任院长判处惯匪田生三年徒刑有许多意见。王文轩从过去的案件中，了解到田生有十三条人命血债，于是又亲到马头乡搜集了群众意见，呈请上级改判。结果改判田生死刑，并把他处决了。后来他又检查出过去重罪轻判的案件十四起，都一一改判，人民十分满意。
    王文轩同志对待案件是十分慎重的。审判员彭维炎向他汇报一件判处蒋洪信极刑案，他反复思索了一夜：为什么会像汇报中所说在审问时，蒋洪信会对原告所告的罪状都无顾虑地承认呢？第二天他和这个审判员共同复审时，发现昨晚听到的汇报中许多地方是原告的一面之词。王文轩又让彭维炎二次携带案卷下乡就地审讯。彭维炎与群众共同审问的结果，实际情况与原告所告的有很大的出入。最后改判蒋洪信五年徒刑。王文轩在处理该县大观头乡农民周顺和打伤他哥哥案件的时候，区、乡干部和群众中有人要求判周顺和徒刑。但是王文轩觉得周顺和兄弟俩过去感情很好，因一时冲动打了起来，只教育周顺和向他哥哥道歉拿出医药费就是了。这样他们兄弟又能和好，又不耽误生产。他打通了干部与群众思想后，就这样作了处理，结果周顺和兄弟俩果然言归于好了。有一天夜里，第三区区人民政府打来电话说马头乡发现一个农民被杀死在一块地里。王文轩马上带一个法警，连夜走了五十里，赶到现场调查。经过两天深入了解，并同群众研究的结果，才知道这个农民不是被害，而是自杀的。
    有一对青年夫妇到法院打离婚官司，男的叫孙本义，女的名李秀荣。男的不同意离婚，女的硬说感情不好，但说不出对方虐待的行为。女的又说：
    “如不离婚，算输理了。”王文轩觉得其中一定有别的问题，第二天他就派人带案下乡调查。经过了解，才知道问题是孙本义的妈妈和妹妹阻挠他们夫妇同居而引起的。在批评了孙的母亲和妹妹后，母女三人都承认了错误。孙李夫妇俩也和好了。
    王文轩这种深入群众的作风，已改变了开封县人民法院过去“坐堂问案”的旧作风。凡有疑问的案子，法院的干部都自动带案下乡深入调查。有时候天晚了，来了告状的农民，王文轩还亲自或派人帮助他们解决住宿饮食问题。
    王文轩自己生活很朴素，一双鞋穿了一年零七个月，补了两次，还舍不得丢掉。碰到同志们闹情绪，不好好工作，他总耐心地帮助他们，启发他们。因此开封县人民法院的干部，不仅把他当作一个领导者，还把他当作自己最亲密的朋友。
