The East China Financial and Economic Committee convened the first East China Agricultural Implement Work Conference from December 6th to 13th. The conference summarized the achievements of the agricultural implement work in East China last year and this year, and determined the guiding principles for next year: continue to supplement old agricultural implements, steadily and actively promote new agricultural implements, focus on promoting complete sets of horse-drawn agricultural implements, and pilot agricultural machinery stations. The conference pointed out that agricultural leading organs in East China had achieved considerable success in solving the difficulty of insufficient agricultural implements last year and this year. In many areas, the difficulty of supplementing old agricultural implements has been solved by making full use of the production capacity of handicrafts and organizing iron and wood handicraft cooperatives. In the past two years, more than 240,000 pieces of various new agricultural implements have been promoted throughout the region.

During the conference, experiences from various regions were exchanged. Everyone unanimously agreed that agricultural implement work must be closely integrated with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Experiences from various regions have proven that farmers' organization of collective labor can improve efficiency in agriculture.
Currently, agricultural implements in the East China region are still basically insufficient, especially in the old revolutionary base areas and mountainous areas that suffered the most from war damage. According to current cultivation needs, the region still lacks about a quarter of the main agricultural implements such as plows, harrows, seeders, and waterwheels. In order to make agricultural implement work cooperate with next year's larger-scale patriotic production increase movement and adapt to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the conference emphasized that under the unified leadership of the East China Financial and Economic Committee, all regions, especially the old revolutionary base areas, must attach importance to and strengthen agricultural implement work in the future. The conference decided that next year, a total of 652 iron and wood handicraft production cooperatives will be established in various regions throughout the region, 19 new agricultural implement promotion stations will be added, the existing three agricultural implement manufacturing plants in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui will be expanded, 23 horse-drawn agricultural implement promotion stations will be established, and three agricultural machinery stations will be piloted.

    华东财政经济委员会召开农具工作会议
    华东财政经济委员会在十二月六日到十三日，召开了华东第一届农具工作会议。会议总结了去年和今年华东农具工作的成绩，并确定明年的方针：继续增补旧农具，稳步地、积极地推广新式农具，有重点地推广成套马拉农具，试办农业机器站。会议指出：华东各地农业领导机关在去年和今年解决农具不足的困难，曾获得不少成绩。许多地区由于充分利用手工业的生产能力，组织铁木手工业合作社，解决了增补旧农具的困难。全区两年来共推广各种新式农具二十四万多件。
    会议中交流了各地的经验，大家一致认为农具工作必须与互助合作运动密切结合。各地经验证明：由于农民组织集体劳动，可以更高地发挥农具的效率，就解决了旧农具不足的困难。
    目前华东区的农具基本上还是不够的，特别是遭受战争破坏最大的老根据地和山区。按照目前耕作的需要，全区还缺乏犁、耙、播种器、水车等主要农具四分之一左右。为了使农具工作配合明年更大规模的爱国丰产运动，并和互助合作运动的发展相适应，会议强调：在华东财政经济委员会统一领导下，今后各地特别是老根据地必须重视和加强农具工作。会议决定：明年计划全区各地共要建立六百五十二个铁木手工业生产合作社，增设十九个新式农具推广站，扩大山东、江苏、安徽现有的三个农具制造厂，建立二十三处马拉农具推广站，试办三个农业机器站。　（据新华社讯）
