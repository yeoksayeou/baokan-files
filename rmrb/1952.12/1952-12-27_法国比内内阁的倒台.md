International Brief Commentary

    The fall of the Pinay government in France, the seventeenth cabinet in postwar France, which lasted for just over nine months, has been announced. This is not surprising; even American news agencies predicted when Pinay came to power that "Pinay's tenure would not be long." It would be strange if Pinay could both continue to carry out the dirty war of expanding armaments and preparing for war and aggression against Vietnam, and at the same time rescue France's economic crisis.

    The arms expansion plan that the United States forced France to implement has brought the French economy to the brink of bankruptcy. Many short-lived cabinets have been forced to step down because they wanted to further increase the taxes that the French people could no longer afford in order to maintain huge military expenditures. After taking office, Pinay vigorously boasted of carrying out "experiments" to "save the franc" and "avoid France's economic collapse," proclaiming that he would not increase taxes or issue currency excessively to avoid the franc's value from plummeting. In reality, this was just a deceptive trick. He wanted to maintain a balance in budget revenue and expenditure by issuing public bonds and cutting civilian spending, but the result was a predictable failure. Due to the bankruptcy of government credit, the issuance of public bonds was unsuccessful, and the amount of currency issued has increased by more than 150 billion in nine months; the trade deficit has continued to increase, domestic prices have continued to rise, and the franc's credit has been declining. As for the attack on the people's living standards, it has been strongly opposed by people from all walks of life; Pinay attempted to suppress the people's struggle for bread, freedom, and independence with fascist means, but aroused even greater anger among the people. Therefore, many right-wing parties had to refuse to support Pinay's "experiment." Pinay's recent fiscal bill to parliament has been repeatedly frustrated. Under such circumstances of "widespread desertion and separation," Pinay had no choice but to step down in disgrace.

    Pinay's resignation proves once again that any party that pursues the United States' war policy and sells the country to American imperialism as a base for aggression cannot save France's economic crisis, but will only deepen the economic crisis further. As soon as the news of Pinay's resignation spread, violent fluctuations occurred in the Paris market, the franc's value plummeted, and prices soared. This not only shows that Pinay's set of economic stabilization measures has completely failed, but also that even the French bourgeoisie does not believe that Pinay's successor can come up with more ways than he did.

    The fall of the Pinay cabinet is a result of the French people's struggle for peace and democracy. However, what the French people demand is not a "same soup, different medicine" cabinet change, but a fundamental change in national policy. Pinay's resignation will prompt the French people to strengthen their struggle for peace and democracy.

### 法国比内内阁的倒台

    法国比内内阁的倒台
    法国战后的第十七个内阁——比内政府维持了九个多月的寿命，又宣告垮台了。这是不足为奇的，甚至美国的通讯社在比内上台的时候，也曾预料到“比内在任不会长久”。如果比内一面继续进行扩军备战和侵略越南的肮脏战争，而又能挽救法国的经济危机，那才是奇怪的事情。
    美国强迫法国执行的扩军备战计划，使法国经济濒于破产的边缘。许多短命的内阁都是因为想进一步加重法国人民已无法负担的捐税来维持庞大的军费开支而被迫下台的。比内上台后曾极力吹嘘要实行“挽救法郎”和“避免法国经济崩溃”的“试验”，宣传他将不增加捐税和滥发通货，以避免法郎价值的暴跌。实际上这只是一种骗人的把戏。他想用发行公债和削减民用开支来保持预算收支的平衡，结果遭到了意料中的失败。由于政府信用的破产，公债的发行没有成功，九个月来通货的发行额却又增加了一千五百多亿；对外贸易的逆差不断增大，国内物价继续上涨，法郎的信用日益下落。至于对人民生活水平的进攻，则受到各阶层人民的强烈反对；比内企图以法西斯的手段来镇压人民要求面包、争取自由与独立的斗争，却激起了人民更大的愤怒。因此，许多右翼的政党对于比内的“试验”也不得不表示拒绝支持。比内最近向议会提出的财政法案，就不断遭到挫折。在这种“众叛亲离”的情形下，比内只好狼狈下台了。
    比内的下台，又一次证明了：任何奉行美国战争政策的、把国家出卖给美帝国主义充当侵略基地的政党，都不可能挽救法国的经济危机，相反的只会使经济危机更为加深。比内辞职的消息一传出，巴黎的市场就发生了剧烈的波动，法郎价值暴跌，物价狂涨。这不仅说明比内的一套稳定经济的办法完全破产，而且连法国资产阶级也不相信比内的继任者能拿出比他更多的办法。
    比内内阁的倒台，是法国人民争取和平民主斗争的一个结果。但是法国人民所要求的不是“换汤不换药”的内阁更迭，而是国家政策的翻然改变。比内的下台，将促使法国人民加强为争取和平与民主的斗争。
