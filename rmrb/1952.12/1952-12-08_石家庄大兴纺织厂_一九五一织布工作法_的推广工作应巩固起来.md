    Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory
    The Promotion of the "1951 Weaving Method" Should Be Consolidated

    Editor: The weaving workshop of Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory began promoting the "1951 Weaving Method" in June of this year, but it has not been well consolidated to this day. The reason is that the battalion assistant员 (ying zhuli yuan, a type of assistant) of the factory's cloth section has a complacent attitude and does not go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation. They believe that their old machines can weave 27 or 28 yards of cloth per shift per machine, which is already good. The battalion assistant often says, "The Shijiazhuang Textile Factory has new machines with automatic shuttle changes, and they only weave 22 or 23 yards of cloth." Therefore, they do not pay much attention to the promotion of the "1951 Weaving Method." From June to now, they have never inspected the promotion's progress even once. As a result, the "1951 Weaving Method" has been left to its own devices, and many people do not implement it. More than half of the people do not comply with the shift handover system. There is a lot of fluff in the workshop, and the operators do not sweep it, which affects the oilers' work. Many shuttles are broken and not repaired in time, which often causes the thread to break during operation.

    The difficulties in the work of the "little teachers" (xiao xiansheng - generally refers to skilled workers teaching others) have also not been resolved in a timely manner. Currently, the rate of substandard cloth is already over 15%, and the rate of recovered silk is over 0.9%.

    Therefore, I hope that the leading cadres of Daxing Textile Factory will conduct a thorough inspection of the workshop and then develop a plan to consolidate the "1951 Weaving Method."

### 石家庄大兴纺织厂  “一九五一织布工作法”的推广工作应巩固起来

    石家庄大兴纺织厂
    “一九五一织布工作法”的推广工作应巩固起来
    编辑同志：石家庄大兴纺织厂织布车间，今年六月就推广了“一九五一织布工作法”，但至今还没有很好巩固下来。原因是该厂布科营助理员存在着自满情绪，不深入下层了解情况，认为他们老掉牙的机器每班每台能织二十七、八码布就算不错了。营助理员经常说：“石家庄纺织厂是新机器，自动换梭，也只织二十二、三码布。”因此，对“一九五一织布工作法”的推广工作很不重视，自六月至现在，从未检查过一次推广的情况。因此，“一九五一织布工作法”陷于自流，许多人都不执行。交接班制度有一半以上的人没有遵守。车里的花毛很多，值车工也不扫，影响了加油工的加油工作。许多梭子坏了，也不及时修好，开车时经常把线碰断。
    “小先生”工作中的困难，也未及时得到解决。现在，次布率已占百分之十五以上，回丝率占百分之零点九以上。
    因此，我希望大兴纺织厂的领导干部，深入车间进行一次检查，然后作出巩固“一九五一织布工作法”的计划。　孙文康
