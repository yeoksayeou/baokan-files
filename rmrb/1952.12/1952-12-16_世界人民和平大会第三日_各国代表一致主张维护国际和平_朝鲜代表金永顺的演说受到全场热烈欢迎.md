Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 15th: The morning session of the World People's Peace Congress on the 14th was chaired by Song Qingling, a renowned public figure from the People's Republic of China. The first speaker was General José Rafael Gabaldón, Chairman of the Venezuelan Committee for the Defense of Peace and Democracy. He stated that the people of Latin American countries should demand that their governments abolish treaties that do not align with their national interests and are related to preparations for another war. He expressed support for the slogan "We will never send our sons to Korea!" stating that this slogan represents the will of the people of all Latin American countries. Gabaldón then exposed the American politicians who launched the shameful war in Korea, advocating that anyone who starts a war should be sent to prison.

Next to speak was Ali Sad, a representative of Muslims in the Soviet Union. He represented millions of Muslims in the Soviet Union in expressing their boundless enthusiasm for maintaining lasting world peace. He then detailed the happy lives of Soviet Muslims and how they, along with people of all ethnicities, work together to transform deserts into fertile land. Ali Sad said: Thanks be to God, my contemporaries and I are fortunate to be born in this era, because I can personally witness that in the multi-ethnic Soviet Union, Muslims have found their happiness in this world.

Ali Sad continued: But my happiness cannot be said to be perfect, because I see that our brothers—the people of many Eastern countries—still live in dire straits. Ali Sad finally called on religious leaders and all believers in Islamic countries to rise up to defend international peace, because truth and justice are on the side of the peace defenders.

The next speaker was Professor Taublaetzberger, a representative from Austria. He emphasized the importance of the words of Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, saying: The most reliable guarantee of a country's security is its independence, not joining so-called "defense systems." Joining "defense systems" will result in the country being dragged into conflicts with other countries that it does not want to participate in. This explains why the people of Western European countries are rising up to vehemently oppose all kinds of military pacts, blocs, and alliances.

Professor Taublaetzberger pointed out: When discussing the first item on the Congress agenda—national independence and international security—special attention should be paid to Austria. He said that our country has been dragged into the Cold War and is suffering great economic difficulties. The country's economic development is not in the interests of the people. In the past, we have always produced manufactured goods in exchange for food and raw materials, but now we are increasingly exporting raw materials and semi-finished products to the West. This has increased the number of unemployed and created a trade deficit. Because we are prohibited from trading with our natural neighbors in the East, Austria is suffering from a crisis of overproduction and a sharp decline in living standards. Austria is being turned into a bastion of the Atlantic "defense system." A military power is building certain facilities on our territory, which will endanger the lives of the Austrian people if the tense situation further escalates.

Professor Taublaetzberger continued: But we are pleased to point out that broad sections of the Austrian people have risen up to demand guarantees for our country's security and peace. The Austrian delegation recommends that the following be included in the resolution of the World People's Peace Congress:

"The World People's Peace Congress advocates for the immediate resumption of the Four Powers' negotiations on an Austrian peace treaty, based on the key points of the agreement already reached by the Four Powers. The World People's Peace Congress supports all efforts aimed at enabling the withdrawal of occupying forces from Austria and ensuring the rapid and smooth conclusion of negotiations that guarantee Austria's democratic rights and independence."

The representatives listened intently to the speech by Korean representative Kim Yong-soon, who spoke of the suffering of Korean mothers and wives, and the heroic struggle of the entire Korean people for their freedom and independence. Kim Yong-soon cited many eloquent facts to expose the brutal crimes of the American aggressors in Korea, who cruelly massacred civilians—the old, the weak, women, and children. For example, they wantonly bombed a small village with no military targets. They dropped forty bombs on the village, which had nothing but a few farmhouses and an orphanage that housed the children of Korean soldiers who had sacrificed themselves for the freedom of their country. As a result, forty-three children were killed and seventeen were injured.

Kim Yong-soon then spoke of the tragic fate of a Korean mother whose son was snatched from her arms and killed by American soldiers. The American soldiers gouged out the dead child's eyes and forced the child's mother to swallow them. The unfortunate mother pounced on these beasts, and as a result, she was killed.

Kim Yong-soon said: Many such examples can be cited. American devils drop germ-laden objects from airplanes—penholders, pencils, and candies—to infect Korean children.

Kim Yong-soon then emphasized: All these atrocities are being carried out under the banner of the United Nations, and all these crimes are reported as "battle achievements" of the UN forces. She appealed: Honest American women, don't you know that your husbands and sons are massacring Korean women and children, and burning down beautiful Korean cities and villages? The faces of your husbands and sons are branded with the infamous mark of aggressors and murderers. They will forever be cursed by the Korean people. Why do you cherish your sons as they grow up, only to send them to their deaths? The Korean people will never forgive their crimes, and they are destined to die shamefully.

Kim Yong-soon reminded the representatives that the early end of the Korean War and the establishment of universal peace also depend on the efforts of American women and their struggle for peace.

She continued: It has been two and a half years since the American imperialists committed all kinds of brutal and unparalleled crimes in Korea. But they have not been able to conquer the Korean people, and they will never be able to conquer the Korean people, because the Korean people love their freedom and independence, and they are willing to sacrifice their lives to fight for freedom and independence.

Kim Yong-soon concluded: It is imperative to demand the immediate cessation of the Korean War and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. She said: All progressive mankind should demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, because this is the only way to ensure lasting peace.

All the representatives unanimously stood up and welcomed Kim Yong-soon with a storm of applause.

Polish representative, writer Iwaszkiewicz, delivered a speech on national independence and international security. He cited the friendly cooperation between Poland and the German Democratic Republic as an example of peacefully resolving disputes between peoples. He said: The Polish people have a long-cherished ideal, which is to maintain the current friendly and harmonious relations with the German people after the establishment of a unified and independent Germany. Iwaszkiewicz concluded by pointing out: For the sake of peace, the Polish people are prepared to cooperate with all countries to stop the evil plans of the war-mongers.

The next speaker was Professor Kokkalis of the University of Athens, former Greek government minister. Kokkalis pointed out that the rulers of Greece had tried every means to prevent the Greek delegation from attending the World People's Peace Congress. But they did not achieve their goal.

Kokkalis detailed the war preparations being carried out by the United States and the Greek government together, and the concoction of the Athens-Belgrade-Ankara war pact. He said: The Greek people's response to war hysteria, terror tactics, and the persecution of peace fighters is to intensify the struggle for peace and national freedom.

Throughout Greece, one can see slogans written by Greek patriots such as "Peace, Amnesty, Freedom!" and "End American Occupation."

Kokkalis finally read to the Congress the congratulatory message from four hundred Greek patriots imprisoned on Corfu Island who had been sentenced to death. In their congratulatory message, the Greek patriots expressed their confidence in their struggle to defend peace and national independence.

Pavlov, President of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, then spoke, emphasizing the broad representation of the Bulgarian delegation. He said that the Bulgarian delegation came to attend the Congress in order to participate wholeheartedly and effectively in this great effort to unite all sincere people.

Pavlov emphasized the efforts of the Bulgarian people to strive for peaceful coexistence with the people of all countries, including those of neighboring countries—Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. He said that the people of these countries are also trying their best to live in peace with us, but their governments are preventing them from doing so in accordance with the plans of the instigators of another war. He also said: The Bulgarian people will continue to consolidate and maintain, as if protecting their own eyes, their friendship and cooperation with all other democratic, peace-loving, and freedom-loving countries, especially with the Soviet people.

Pavlov then expressed his belief that the World People's Peace Congress will further strengthen the struggle for peace. He called on all representatives attending the Congress to fight for world peace, and the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of all countries.

After a brief speech by Mr. Bristol, a member of the British Labour Party, the morning session came to an end.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 15th: The afternoon session of the World People's Peace Congress on the 14th was chaired by Giuseppe Nitti, a member of the Italian Parliament.

Manuel Cruz, a representative from the Philippines, spoke first, describing how American imperialism is strangling the Philippine national liberation movement. He said: The Philippines is made up of seven thousand islands. But none of these islands truly belong to us. In a country that can feed eighty million people, the majority of our twenty million people do not have enough food, clothing, and shelter, entirely because our economy is subordinate to the American economy. The Philippines has become a source of raw materials for the United States, and the prices of raw materials are determined by the American government.

Cruz said: After the Philippines gained formal "independence" in 1946, it became even more subordinate to the United States. The American rulers like to say that the Philippines is a showcase of American democracy in the Far East, but in fact, our country is an example of imperialist exploitation, and an example of the most brutal military suppression and plunder. The American government has established twenty-three permanent military bases in the Philippines and stationed a large number of armed forces in the Philippines to maintain its rule over the Philippines.

Cruz said that the Philippine people's resistance to American aggression conspiracies is growing stronger and stronger. He pointed out that the Philippine government's action of sending soldiers to Korea aroused resolute protests from public opinion. He said that in 1950, Philippine soldiers in Korea launched an uprising. After this, the Philippine government could only send so-called "symbolic" troops to Korea.

Cruz said that the Philippine authorities boasted that they had achieved "victory" in the war against the People's Liberation Army, but this army is growing stronger and continues to wage a heroic struggle for the freedom of the Philippine people.

The next speaker was the famous Colombian writer Jorge Zalamea. He described the anti-people war preparation policy implemented by the Colombian ruling group under the orders of the United States, and exposed its bloody dictatorial rule. The Colombian authorities persecuted democratic groups and peace advocates, imprisoning them and shooting them. Thousands of patriots fighting for peace and national independence were tortured to death. Zalamea concluded by saying that despite the persecution of peace advocates, the movement for peace and national independence in Colombia is expanding.

The speech by Ms. Zeng Xuehong, a representative from Malaya, was warmly welcomed. In speaking about the history of the war waged by the British imperialists against the Malayan people since 1948, she told the representatives how the British army, with the help of the American imperialists, had used extremely cruel methods to suppress the Malayan people's struggle. As of September this year, more than 50,000 Malayan patriots have been killed, arrested, or exiled, and approximately 500,000 farmers have been driven into so-called resettlement areas, which are in fact concentration camps. British aircraft are bombing Malayan villages, and British aggressors are using chemical weapons to destroy crops, causing greater famine and poverty.

Zeng Xuehong said that the British colonial authorities force Malayan workers to work and only give them meager wages. At the same time, the British are making huge profits from selling Malayan rubber and tin. In 1949, Britain exchanged Malayan rubber and tin for $100 million; in 1950, it exchanged them for $320 million; and in 1951, it was $330 million.

Zeng Xuehong emphasized that the Malayan people's struggle against colonial slavery is part of the struggle for universal peace, because the British imperialists' violation of Malayan independence increases the threat of a new world war. That is why the Malayan people are appealing to all peace-loving people to demand an end to the British colonial aggressors' war of aggression in Malaya.

Pastor Essen of Duisburg conveyed to the representatives the greetings of Dr. Niemöller, Chairman of the Evangelical Church of Hesse, who was unable to attend the Congress.

Essen said that he put forward two appeals to the Congress: first, to restore mutual trust regardless of all difficulties, and to establish a new life for the people of all countries by peaceful means; second, to help Germany achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of unity.

Traian Săvulescu, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Romanian People's Republic, delivered a lengthy speech, saying that Romania attaches particular importance to defending national independence and sovereignty, considering it a major condition for maintaining peace. He spoke in particular about the issue of economic relations between countries, pointing out that one of the basic characteristics of national independence is the right of a country to establish equal and mutually beneficial economic relations with other countries. The economic "blockade" policy has not produced the results expected by the United States. The foreign trade of Eastern European countries and China is expanding year by year. On the other hand, the "blockade" is causing serious damage to the economies of Western European countries, and American monopolists are showing no consideration for the interests of Western European countries.

Săvulescu said that the policy of restricting foreign trade increases the danger of war. It causes the economies of those countries forced to turn to war production to develop in a one-sided way.

He continued, saying that if external forces attempt to prevent people from using their inherent rights to build the life they desire, this is an intolerable violation of the independence of the people of that country, and is a breeding ground for international conflict.

Săvulescu said that there is a way of life that all the people of the world cherish, and that is peace. To ensure the victory of peace, we must strive to achieve decisions through consultation, and to achieve mutual understanding and cooperation among all good people.

Costa Rican lawyer Osvaldo Rodriguez Jimenez delivered a brief speech in which he made sharp criticisms of the work of the United Nations, especially the Security Council. Jimenez said that the reason why the work of the Security Council has not achieved significant results is mainly because the People's Republic of China has not been given its due place in the United Nations family. He said that the World People's Peace Congress must, on behalf of the people of all countries, make a demand to the governments of all countries: the People's Republic of China must obtain its legitimate position in the Security Council, so that the United Nations can exercise its functions as an instrument for maintaining peace.

Next to speak was the head of the Albanian delegation, Eleni Terezi, Deputy Minister of Public Health of Albania. On behalf of the Albanian people, who have lived a happy and free life for eight years, she paid tribute to the Congress and described the remarkable achievements since the establishment of the Albanian people's regime.

She denounced the US-British war-makers and their Belgrade, Greek, and Italian fascist agents for creating armed provocations and sending spies and saboteurs to infiltrate Albania. She pointed out: But all this has only deepened our people's hatred for the war-makers and strengthened their determination to defend their independence. She said that when the Albanian people sent us to attend this Congress, they ordered us to fight for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Our people's signing of the World Peace Council Declaration, totaling 865,885 people, confirms this desire.

Former Spanish Prime Minister José Giral said that the Spanish patriots' struggle for peace is inseparable from the struggle for Spanish independence. He described the situation of the Spanish people's struggle against the Franco regime and American enslavement in disregard of fascist terror. He said that the Spanish people's struggle goes beyond the national scope, because the existence of the Franco regime is a threat to all mankind. Now in Spain, the call for "Americans out of Spain" is becoming louder and louder. These Americans want to use Spain as a strategic base, and they want its manpower and resources. But Spain will never become a foreign colony.

French representative Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie pointed out: The agenda adopted by the Congress includes all the issues that constitute the source of panic for people all over the world. D'Astier de la Vigerie asked the representatives of the Congress to put forward specific suggestions on the issues already included in the agenda as the basis for resolutions.

German writer Anna Seghers said: The current situation in Germany is intolerable. Germany is divided into two parts. The warmongers separated West Germany in order to use it as a base of attack. The danger of a new war threatens people all over the world. She said that the imperialists are now forcing Germans and French to participate in the so-called "European Army," fighting side by side under the command of the US military headquarters against the people of democratic countries. These people must sell their lives to seek profits for the imperialists of Wall Street.

Anna Seghers said: But the imperialists' conspiracy is opposed by the desire of people all over the world for peace. In the German Democratic Republic, the concept of international friendship is the basic principle of educating the new generation. Germany hopes to live in friendship with all countries. This marks the beginning of a new era of world peace.

At the end of the afternoon session, Mrs. Alessandra Piazzo, a representative of the Italian "Catholic Peace Movement Association," delivered a lengthy speech. This organization has little connection with the peace movement, but it accepted the invitation of the World Peace Council and sent representatives to participate in this Congress. On behalf of the Catholic Peace Movement Association, she put forward a suggestion: to convene a conference of the six major countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the People's Republic of China, Britain, and India, to seek peaceful solutions to various problems that cause international tensions, especially the problems that prevent the cessation of current wars in various places. She suggested formulating a ten-year United Nations plan with the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States, which would replace Truman's "Point Four" program and the "Colombo" plan.

The afternoon session was then adjourned.

    世界人民和平大会第三日
    各国代表一致主张维护国际和平
    朝鲜代表金永顺的演说受到全场热烈欢迎
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：世界人民和平大会十四日上午会议由中华人民共和国著名的公众领袖宋庆龄担任主席。首先发言的是委内瑞拉保卫和平民主委员会主席何塞·拉斐尔·加巴尔顿将军。他说，拉丁美洲各国的人民应该要求他们的政府废除那些不符合他们国家利益的和与准备另一次战争有关的条约。他表示拥护“我们决不将我们的儿子送到朝鲜！”这个口号，他说，这个口号表示了所有拉丁美洲国家人民的意愿。加巴尔顿接着揭露了在朝鲜发动可耻的战争的美国政客们，他主张：凡是发动战争的人都该送进监狱去。
    接着发言的是苏联伊斯兰教徒代表阿里·萨德。他代表苏联数百万伊斯兰教徒表示他们维护世界持久和平的无限热情。他又详细地叙述了苏联伊斯兰教徒的幸福生活和他们如何与各族人民一同努力，把沙漠变成良田。阿里·萨德说：托上帝之福，我的同代人和我能生在这个时代，因为我能亲眼看到在多民族的苏联，伊斯兰教徒已在人间找到了他们的幸福。
    阿里·萨德继续说：但是我的幸福不能说是完美的，因为我看到我们的弟兄们——许多东方国家的人民仍然生活在水深火热之中。阿里·萨德最后号召伊斯兰教国家的宗教领袖和所有教徒起来保卫国际和平，因为真理和正义是在和平保卫者这一边的。
    接着发言的是奥地利代表陶布莱茨伯格教授。他强调世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的话的重要性，他说：一个国家的安全的最可靠的保障，是它的独立，而不是加入所谓“防御体系”，加入“防御体系”的结果会使这个国家被卷入它不愿意参加的与其他国家的冲突中。这就说明为什么西欧各国人民要起来极力反对各种各样的军事公约、集团和联盟。
    陶布莱茨伯格教授指出：在讨论大会议程的第一项——民族独立与国际安全问题——时，应特别注意奥地利。他说，我国被拖入冷战，遭受着很大的经济困难。这个国家的经济发展不符合人民的利益。过去，我们一向生产制成品，来换取粮食和原料，而现在，我们越来越多地向西方输出原料和半制成品。这样就使失业的人数增加，并且造成了贸易逆差。由于禁止我们和我们的东方天然邻国进行贸易，奥地利遭受着生产过剩的危机，生活水准急剧地下降。奥地利正被变成大西洋“防御体系”的
    一个堡垒。一个军事强国正在我们的国土上建筑某种设备，如果紧张局势进一步严重起来，这种设备将使奥地利人民生命遭受危险。
    陶布莱茨伯格教授接着说：但是我们很高兴地指出：奥地利广大阶层的人民已起来要求保障我国的安全与和平。奥地利代表团建议把下列一条列入世界人民和平大会的决议案中：
    “世界人民和平大会主张根据四大国业已达成的协议的要点，立即恢复四大国关于对奥和约的谈判。世界人民和平大会支持目的在使占领军从奥地利撤退成为可能，和保证奥地利的民主权利和独立的谈判能迅速和顺利地结束的一切努力。”
    代表们全神贯注地听了朝鲜代表金永顺的演说，她谈到朝鲜母亲和妻子所受到的痛苦，谈到全体朝鲜人民为争取自己的自由和独立而进行的英勇斗争。金永顺举出许多雄辩的事实来揭露美国侵略者在朝鲜的残暴罪行，他们残酷地屠杀平民——老弱妇孺。例如，他们疯狂地滥炸一个没有军事目标的小村庄。他们向这个村庄投掷了四十颗炸弹，而这个村庄除了几家农户和一个收容为祖国的自由而牺牲了的朝鲜战士的儿女的孤儿院外，其他一无所有。结果，四十三个儿童被炸死，十七个被炸伤。
    金永顺接着谈到一位朝鲜母亲的悲惨命运，美国兵把她的儿子从她手中抢去杀死了。美国兵挖出死了的孩子的一双眼睛，并要孩子的母亲把它吞下。不幸的母亲向这些野兽们猛扑，结果她牺牲了。
    金永顺说：像这样的例子可以举出许许多多。美国恶魔们从飞机上投下带菌的物体——钢笔杆、铅笔、糖果，使朝鲜儿童受传染。
    金永顺接着着重指出：所有这些暴行都是在联合国旗帜下进行的，并且所有这些罪行都当作联合国军的“战果”向上报告。她呼吁说：正直的美国妇女们，难道你们不知道你们丈夫和儿子正在屠杀朝鲜妇女儿童、焚烧朝鲜美丽的城市和村庄吗？你们丈夫和儿子的脸上烙上了侵略者和杀人犯的不名誉的烙印。他们永远要受朝鲜人民的咒骂。为什么你们把你们儿子爱抚成人，而要让他们去送死呢？朝鲜人民决不会饶恕他们的罪行，他们注定要可耻地死去。
    金永顺提醒代表们说：朝鲜战争的尽早结束和建立普遍的和平也有赖于美国妇女的努力和她们为争取和平而进行的斗争。
    她继续说：美帝国主义者在朝鲜干了各种残暴无比的罪行，到现在已有两年半了。但是他们没有能够征服朝鲜人民，而且永远征服不了朝鲜人民，因为朝鲜人民爱好他们的自由和独立，他们不惜牺牲自己的生命为争取自由与独立而斗争。
    金永顺最后说：必须要求立即停止朝鲜战争，所有外国军队自朝鲜撤退。她说：全体进步人类应该要求缔结五大国和平公约，因为这样才能确保持久和平。
    全体代表一致起立以暴风雨般的掌声对金永顺表示欢迎。
    波兰代表、作家伊瓦希凯维奇就民族独立和国际安全问题发表演说。他举出波兰和德意志民主共和国之间的友谊合作，作为和平解决各国人民之间的纠纷的例子。他说：波兰人民有一个怀抱很久的理想，就是在一个统一的、独立的德国建立后，和德国人民保持目前这种友好的、和睦的关系。伊瓦希凯维奇最后指出：为了和平，波兰人民准备与一切国家合作，以阻止战争贩子的罪恶计划。
    接着发言的是雅典大学教授、前希腊政府大臣科卡利斯教授。科卡利斯指出：希腊的统治者曾千方百计阻止希腊代表团出席世界人民和平大会。但是他们并没有达到目的。
    科卡利斯详细叙述美国与希腊政府一同进行备战活动，拼凑雅典—贝尔格莱德—安卡拉战争公约的情形。他说：希腊人民对战争歇斯底里、恐怖手段和迫害和平战士的暴行的答复是加紧为争取和平，争取民族自由而斗争。
    在希腊境内，到处可以看到希腊爱国者所写的“和平、大赦、自由！”和“结束美国占领”等标语。
    科卡利斯最后向大会宣读了被囚禁在科孚岛上的已被宣判死刑的四百名希腊爱国者给大会的贺词。希腊爱国者们在贺词中表示了他们为保卫和平、保卫民族独立而斗争的信心。
    保加利亚科学院院长巴夫洛夫接着发言，他强调保加利亚代表团的广泛代表性。他说，保加利亚代表团来出席大会，是为了要全心全意地、有效地参加这种使一切有诚意的人民团结在一起的伟大努力。
    巴夫洛夫强调保加利亚人民努力争取与各国人民，包括各邻国——南斯拉夫、希腊和土耳其——的人民在内，和平共处。他说，这些国家的人民也是竭力想与我们和平相处的，但是他们的政府遵照另一次战争的煽动者的计划，阻止他们这样做。他又说：保加利亚人民将继续像保护眼珠一样地巩固和维护与一切其他民主、爱好和平、爱好自由的国家，首先是与苏联人民的友谊和合作。
    巴夫洛夫然后表示，他相信世界人民和平大会将进一步加强争取和平的斗争。他要求所有出席大会的代表为世界和平、各国的自由、独立和主权而斗争。
    英国工党党员布里斯托尔发表简短的演说后，上午的会议即告结束。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：世界人民和平大会十四日下午会议由意大利议会议员裘塞佩·尼蒂担任主席。
    菲律宾代表马纽尔·柯鲁兹首先发言，他叙述了美帝国主义怎样在扼杀菲律宾的民族解放运动。他说：菲律宾是由七千个海岛组成的。但这些海岛没有一个是真正属于我们的。在一个能养活八千万人口的国家中，我国的两千万人口的大多数竟没有充分的食粮、衣着和住所，这完全是因为我们的经济是美国经济的附属物。菲律宾已成为美国的原料供应地，原料的价格则听任美国政府决定。
    柯鲁兹说：在菲律宾于一九四六年获得形式上的
    “独立”后，它甚至是更加从属于美国了。美国的统治者喜欢说菲律宾是美国民主在远东的陈列窗，但事实上，我国是帝国主义剥削的一个例子，是最残酷的军事镇压和掠夺的一个例子。美国政府在菲律宾建立了二十三个永久性的军事基地，并在菲律宾驻有大量武装部队，以保持它在菲律宾的统治权。
    柯鲁兹说，菲律宾人民对美国的侵略阴谋反抗越来越强。他指出，菲律宾派遣士兵到朝鲜去的行动，引起舆论的坚决抗议。他说，在一九五零年，在朝鲜的菲律宾士兵曾发动起义。在此以后，菲律宾政府只能派遣所谓“象征性”部队到朝鲜去。
    柯鲁兹说，菲律宾当局叫嚣它在对人民解放军进行的战争中获得“胜利”，但这支军队却日益强大，并继续为争取菲律宾人民的自由而进行英勇的斗争。
    接着发言的是著名的哥伦比亚作家乔治·萨拉米亚。他叙述了哥伦比亚统治集团奉美国之命而施行的反人民的备战政策，并揭露了它的血腥独裁统治。哥伦比亚当局迫害民主团体及和平拥护者，监禁他们并枪杀他们。成千的为和平与民族独立而斗争的爱国人士被折磨至死。萨拉米亚最后说，虽然有着对和平拥护者的迫害，但哥伦比亚的争取和平与民族独立的运动却正在扩大。
    马来亚代表曾雪虹的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。她在讲到一九四八年开始的英帝国主义者对付马来亚人民的战争的历史时，向代表们诉说了英国军队曾在美帝国主义者的帮助下使用过何等残酷的方法，来镇压马来亚人民的斗争。到今年九月为止，有五万多名马来亚爱国人士被杀死、被逮捕或被放逐，约有五十万农民被驱入所谓移殖区，这些地方实际上就是集中营。英国飞机在轰炸马来亚乡村，英国侵略者用化学药品来摧毁庄稼，引起了更大的饥馑和贫困。
    曾雪虹说，英国殖民当局强迫马来亚工人工作，只给他们少得可怜的工资。同时英国人却从出卖马来亚橡胶和锡的中间获得了巨大的利润。在一九四九年，英国以马来亚橡胶和锡换取了一亿美元；一九五○年，它换取了三亿二千万美元；一九五一年是三亿三千万美元。
    曾雪虹强调说，马来亚人民反对殖民地奴役的斗争，是争取普遍和平的斗争的一部分，因为英帝国主义者侵犯马来亚的独立，也就增加了新的世界大战的威胁。这就是为什么马来亚人民向一切爱好和平的人民呼吁，要求终止英国殖民者在马来亚的侵略战争的原因。
    杜伊斯堡的埃森牧师向代表们转达了黑森州基督教福音会会长尼穆勒博士的贺意，后者未能来参加大会。
    埃森说，他向大会提出两项呼吁：第一，不顾一切困难恢复互相之间的信任，并以和平方法为各国人民建立新生活；第二，帮助德国达成缔结和约和恢复统一。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国科学院院长特里扬·萨伏列斯库发表了长篇演说，他说，罗马尼亚对于保卫民族独立和主权是特别重视的，认为这是保持和平的一个主要条件。他特别谈到各国之间的经济关系的问题，他指出，民族独立的基本特点之一就是一个国家有和其他国家建立平等互利的经济关系的权利。经济“封锁”政策并没有产生美国所期望的结果。东欧国家和中国的对外贸易正在一年一年地扩大。另一方面，“封锁”正使西欧国家的经济遭受严重的损害，而美国垄断资本家对于西欧国家的利益是毫不考虑的。
    萨伏列斯库说，限制对外贸易的政策增加了战争危险。它使得那些被迫转入战争生产的国家的经济形成片面的发展。
    他接着说，如果有外来的力量企图阻止人民利用其固有的权利来建立自己所希望的生活，这就是对于那个国家的人民的独立的不可容忍的侵犯，并且是国际冲突的一个温床。
    萨伏列斯库说，有一种生活方式是世界所有各国人民都珍视的，那就是和平。为了确保和平的胜利，我们必须努力获致经过协商的决定，获致所有善良人们之间的互相谅解和合作。
    哥斯达黎加律师奥斯瓦尔多·罗得黎格兹·金姆纳兹发表了简短的演说，他对联合国特别是安全理事会的工作，作了尖锐的批评。金姆纳兹说，安全理事会的工作之所以没有获得重大的成绩，主要是因为中华人民共和国在联合国家庭里没有得到它应得的位置。他说，世界人民和平大会必须代表各国人民向各国政府提出要求：中华人民共和国在安全理事会中必须取得其合法的地位，这样联合国才可以作为一个维持和平的工具而行使其职权。
    接着是阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长、阿尔巴尼亚公共卫生部副部长艾列尼·特列齐发言。她代表已经过了八年幸福而自由的生活的阿尔巴尼亚人民，向大会致敬，并叙述了阿尔巴尼亚人民政权建立以来的显著成就。
    她斥责美英战争制造者及其贝尔格来德、希腊和意大利法西斯代理人制造武装挑衅和派遣间谍及破坏分子潜入阿尔巴尼亚。她指出：但是这一切只有加深了我国人民对于战争制造者的仇恨并加强了他们保卫独立的决心。她说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在派遣我们出席这个大会的时候，曾命令我们为缔结五大国和平公约而斗争。我国人民在世界和平理事会宣言上签名的达八十六万五千八百八十五名，从而证实了他们的这种愿望。
    前西班牙总理何塞·希拉尔说，西班牙爱国者为争取和平而进行的斗争是和争取西班牙独立的斗争分不开的。他叙述了西班牙人民不顾法西斯恐怖进行反对佛朗哥政权和美国奴役的斗争的情形。他说，西班牙人民的斗争超出了民族的范围，因为佛朗哥政权的存在是对全人类的一个威胁。现在在西班牙，“美国人滚出西班牙”的呼声是越来越响亮了。这些美国人想把西班牙当做一个战略基地，他们想要它的人力和资源。但是西班牙永远不会变成一个外国的殖民地。
    法国代表埃曼虞埃尔·达斯第埃·德拉维热里指出：大会通过的议程包含构成全世界人民恐慌之源的一切问题。达斯第埃·德拉维热里要求大会代表就已列入议程的问题提出具体的建议，作为决议的基础。
    德国作家安娜·西格斯说：目前德国的情况是令人不能容忍的。德国分成了两部分。战争贩子把西德分开，为的是利用它做进攻基地。新战争的危险威胁着全世界人民。她说，帝国主义者现在正强迫德国和法国人参加所谓“欧洲军”，在美军司令部指挥下并肩对民主国家的人民作战。这些人必须卖命为华尔街的帝国主义者谋取利润。
    安娜·西格斯说：但是帝国主义者的图谋遭到全世界人民要求和平的愿望的反对。在德意志民主共和国，国际友好这个观念是教育新的一代的基本原则。德国希望与一切国家友好相处。这标志着一个世界和平的新时代的开始。
    在下午会议结束时，意大利“天主教和平运动协会”的代表亚历山德拉·皮雅佐夫人发表了长篇的演说。这个组织与和平运动并没有什么联系，但是它接受了世界和平理事会的邀请，派遣了代表来参加这次大会。她代表天主教和平运动协会提出一项建议：召开苏联、美国、法国、中华人民共和国、英国和印度等六大国会议，以求和平解决造成国际紧张局势的各种问题，首先是使目前各地战争不能停止的问题。她建议拟定一项有苏联和美国参加在内的联合国十年计划，这个计划将代替杜鲁门的“第四点”计划以及“科伦坡”计划。
    下午会议至此宣告结束。
