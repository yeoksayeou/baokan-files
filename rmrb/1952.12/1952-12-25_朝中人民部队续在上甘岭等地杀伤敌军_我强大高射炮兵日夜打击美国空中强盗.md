Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 24th: Recently, several short battles have occurred on the central front. On the hills to the left of Triangle Hill (Sangganling) north of Kimhwa, the ROK (Republic of Korea) troops, huddled on the low slopes next to our army's positions, launched an attack on the northeastern positions of the main peak, defended by our forces, on December 13th, in an attempt to improve their extremely unfavorable situation. The enemy attacked from morning until dusk, suffering over 180 casualties before retreating to their starting point. That night, our army's night raid team suddenly attacked a platoon-sized enemy position, repelling four enemy counterattacks, eliminating over 60 enemy soldiers, and firmly occupying the position. Two days later, the enemy attacked the main peak and surrounding positions four more times, but were repelled, and our army killed or wounded over 60 more enemy soldiers. In the aforementioned battles, our army eliminated a total of over 300 ROK troops.

On the Kumhwa front, our army raiding parties launched four attacks in three days, completely annihilating three enemy ROK squads and most of two other squads. These battles all took place near the cliffs northwest of Gimseong. On the 13th and 14th, our army raided two enemy forward outposts northwest and southwest of the cliffs, completely annihilating the defending two squads without suffering any casualties. On the night of the 19th, our army completely annihilated a defending enemy squad south of the cliffs, with only one of our soldiers sustaining minor injuries. At the same time, our army attacked two enemy squads west of the cliffs; the battle lasted ten minutes, and all thirteen of the defending enemy soldiers were annihilated except for four who fled upon hearing the sounds of fighting, while two of our soldiers were wounded and one sacrificed. The casualty ratio between the enemy and our side in the four raids was eleven to one.

From December 13th to 19th, over the course of seven days, our army's mobile frontline artillery fire killed or wounded over 870 enemy soldiers. Our army's anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down nine enemy planes and damaged twenty-six.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 24th: The anti-aircraft artillery of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces is striking American air bandits day and night on the snow-covered positions. On the early morning of December 5th, a batch of enemy planes intruded into the airspace over Western Mountain and Doryufeng on the central front. The anti-aircraft artillery commander issued the order to "fire at the lead plane," and the anti-aircraft guns, concealed in a snowfield, immediately unleashed fierce fire. In an instant, the enemy's lead plane crashed straight down next to the anti-aircraft artillery position, smashing into a pile of scrap iron, and the pilot was turned into minced meat. After a while, twenty-four more enemy planes aggressively flew over the anti-aircraft artillery position. But as the first enemy plane dove down and dropped the first bomb, it was hit by anti-aircraft fire; a flash of light was seen, and it fell from the sky. Most of the enemy planes were frightened and desperately climbed into the sky, with only four cunning enemy planes diving in from the side, suddenly attacking our army's anti-aircraft artillery positions. But as a result of the battle, one of the four was shot down. In four hours of fierce fighting, a total of eight enemy planes were shot down and nine were damaged.

Enemy planes, unable to gain an advantage during the day, flew in to attack at night, and the anti-aircraft gunners fought the enemy planes in the darkness. At ten o'clock on the night of the 8th, an enemy B-29 bomber had just flown over our army's positions when it was surrounded by strings of red tracers and anti-aircraft shells fired from anti-aircraft machine guns. The enemy plane tried to turn around and escape, but it was too late; a shell hit it, and the fuselage immediately burst into flames. When it fell to the ground, the bombs it was carrying exploded, and the six American pilots were blown to pieces.

    朝中人民部队续在上甘岭等地杀伤敌军
    我强大高射炮兵日夜打击美国空中强盗
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】最近在中部前线发生了多次时间短促的小战斗。在金化以北上甘岭左边山岭上，蜷缩在我军阵地旁边低矮山坡上的李伪军为了改善他们极端不利的处境，十二月十三日出动两个连向主峰东北我军扼守的阵地攻击。敌人从早晨一直攻到黄昏，伤亡了一百八十多人后退回到他们的攻击出发地。这天夜里，我军一支夜袭队突然袭入敌人一个排的阵地，并击退敌人四次反击，歼敌六十多名，稳固地占领了这个阵地。隔了两天，敌人又向主峰和周围的阵地攻击四次，都被击退，我军又毙伤敌人六十多名。在上述战斗中，我军共计歼灭李伪军三百多人。
    在金城前线，我军袭击队在三天之内出动四次，共计歼灭守敌李伪军三个班全部和两个班大部。这些战斗都是在金城西北边岩洞附近进行的。十三、十四两日，我军袭入边岩洞西北和西南敌人的两个前哨阵地，将守敌两个班全部歼灭，我无一伤亡。十九日夜里，我军在边岩洞以南全歼守敌一个班，我一人负轻伤。与此同时，我军又袭击边岩洞以西敌人两个班的阵地，战斗十分钟，守敌除四人闻声先行逃跑外，其余的十三人全部被歼，我二人负伤，一人牺牲。四次袭击作战，敌我伤亡比率是十一比一。
    从十二月十三日到十九日的七天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军八百七十多名。我军高射炮火共击落敌机九架，击伤二十六架。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】朝中人民部队的高射炮兵在白雪覆盖的阵地上日夜打击着美国空中强盗。十二月五日清晨，一批敌机闯进了中部前线西方山、斗流峰的上空。高射炮指挥员发出了“射击领航机”的命令，隐蔽在一片雪地里的高射炮立即发出猛烈的炮火。瞬眼间敌人的领航机就笔直地落在高射炮阵地的旁边，摔成一堆碎铁，驾驶员也成了肉酱。过了一会，又有二十四架敌机来势汹汹地飞到高射炮阵地的上空。但当第一架敌机俯冲下来扔下第一颗炸弹时，它身上就中了高射炮弹；只见火光一闪，它就从空中掉了下来。于是大部分敌机都吓得拚命升入高空，只有四架狡猾的敌机从侧面俯冲下来，忽地袭击我军的高射炮兵的阵地。但是战斗结果，四架中又有一架被打落下来。在四个小时激战中，共计打落了八架敌机，打伤了九架。
    在白天占不到便宜的敌机又在黑夜里飞来袭击，高射炮手们就在黑夜里与敌机战斗。八日夜里十点钟，敌人一架B—29型轰炸机刚飞到我军阵地上空，就被高射机枪吐出的一串串红色曳光弹和高射炮弹包围起来，敌机想扭头逃跑，但已来不及了，一颗炮弹打中了它，机身立即燃起熊熊大火。当它落到地上时，机上带着的炸弹爆炸了，六个美国驾驶员被炸得粉碎。
