Xinhua News Agency report:

The sub-groups of the Second Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea, while in Korea, extended cordial greetings to commanders, combatants, staff, wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army at the front lines and in the rear, greatly boosting the confidence of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean military and civilians in winning victory against the American aggressors. The first sub-group of the Comfort Mission, consisting of 169 people, went to the area north of Sariwon in Korea to express their deep sympathy to the anti-aircraft artillery units, engineering units, logistics units, railway corps, and railway transportation units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and conveyed the respect and sympathy of the Chinese people to the Korean People's Army units, Korean railway workers, and the Korean local government. The second and fifth sub-groups cordially greeted the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the Korean people on the western front in Korea and visited Kaesong to extend greetings to the Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations and the local people. The third and sixth sub-groups, totaling 152 people, extended cordial greetings to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army units on the central front and sent representatives to visit two field hospitals of the Korean People's Army, the Jiangwon Province government, and the governments of the four counties of Kimhwa, Hwacheon, Anbyeon, and Pyonggang, as well as Hwacheon Middle School, etc. The fourth sub-group extensively visited the Chinese and Korean People's naval defense forces, logistics units, Korean local government, and Korean people on the front lines and in the rear of the east coast of Korea and swept the tomb of combat hero Yang Gensi. The seventh sub-group, consisting of 92 people, visited the Chinese and Korean People's forces defending the coast on the west coast of Korea, as well as the Hwanghae Province government and the local people.

The sub-groups of the Comfort Mission to Korea carried out extensive慰问 (comfort) activities during their more than one month in Korea. According to the statistics of the first, second, fifth, sixth, and seventh sub-groups alone, a total of 2,530 comfort meetings, report meetings, visits, forums, and informal discussions were held; the literary and artistic work teams performed and screened films more than 1,400 times. At various meetings or in tunnel fortifications, the representatives of the sub-groups reported in detail on the concern of the people of all ethnic groups and strata in China for the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in construction over the past three years, and presented flags and various valuable gifts to the Chinese and Korean People's forces. At the same time, the representatives extensively collected many moving heroic deeds of Chinese and Korean People's soldiers, preparing to tell the people of the whole country after returning home.

The representatives of the sub-groups, in order to complete the sacred mission entrusted to them by the people of the whole country, engaged in comfort activities with intensity and enthusiasm, regardless of hardship and danger. Song Chunhua, the representative of the first sub-group, a national model worker of special class, and deputy director of the Tianjin Paper Mill No. 1, waded through more than a foot of mud on the beach despite illness to visit the heroic soldiers guarding the coast on the island. Wang Sheng-san of the Tianjin Railway Administration, Tian Zhonglin of the Jilin Railway Administration, and eight others went to the railway troops for comfort, braving the heavy rain and walking more than ten miles. They also presented flowers and paid tribute at the tomb of Denggao (Climbing High) hero Yang Lian-di and other martyrs. The representatives of the second and fifth sub-groups, in order to shake hands with the soldiers fighting on the front lines, some representatives went to the foot of Maryang Hill, where the British mercenary army had been heavily damaged; some representatives went to the "Red Hillock" on the banks of the Shagawa River, where the American aggressor army had suffered heavy blows. The representatives of the third sub-group braved the heavy rain, crossed more than twenty miles of mountains, passed through the enemy's artillery blockade line, and went to the forward positions of Gaoya Mountain and Xiaoxing Mountain near White Horse Mountain to visit the heroic troops who had wiped out more than 8,000 enemies since October 6. Some representatives also went to the Shangganling front to visit heroes such as Lu He, a machine gun squad leader who had stubbornly carried out six days and nights of tunnel warfare and repelled twenty enemy assaults. The representatives of the sixth sub-group carried Chairman Mao badges and went deep into the forward positions along the Wenden Highway to visit a meritorious regiment of a certain unit that had held its ground for 400 days, and wrote letters to pay tribute to the heroes guarding the Yuyin Mountain position. All the representatives, literary and artistic work team members, and staff of the seventh sub-group worked intensively during their stay in Korea. Xu Liansheng, a farmer representative, underwent abdominal surgery every day before going abroad, but he still marched at night and worked during the day like other representatives. Tong Yutian, a member of the literary and artistic work team and folk artist, injured his foot and bled profusely. He asked someone to help him and endured the pain to finish a crosstalk performance. Some representatives traveled more than 5,000 li during the comfort process, and some representatives visited famous units such as Daebong Mountain Camp, Maryang Hill Hero Company, 38th Parallel Sharp Knife Hero Company, Garrison Hero Company, Niujiaofeng Hero Company, and Model Platoon for Observing Discipline and Loving the People, and also visited special-class heroes Huang Chouhe, Liu Jihe, Guan Chonggui, Hu Jinhua, garrison hero Sun Rongchang, and Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Li Yingchun.

The commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army welcomed the envoys of the people of the motherland with great excitement. The Volunteer Army soldiers fighting on the front lines built松门 (pine gates) at the entrances of the tunnels and posted slogans such as "Welcoming Relatives" and "Greeting the Envoys of the People of the Motherland with the Victory of Battle." The soldiers welcomed the Comfort Mission by beating gongs, cymbals, and leather drums made of enemy shell casings, entertained the Comfort Mission with the best food and vegetables they had grown themselves, and gave up their own houses with heated kang and numbered doors and air-raid shelters for the representatives of the Comfort Mission to live in. Some units even invited the representatives to live in two-story houses built by the soldiers themselves, with flowers, grass, fish ponds, and long fences woven from wild vines in front of the buildings. The soldiers also warmly invited the representatives to take baths in bathtubs made of enemy gasoline drums. The units also performed lively and vivid welcome programs written and performed by the soldiers themselves.

The Volunteer Army units also welcomed the arrival of the Comfort Mission with victories in battle. When the first sub-group of the Comfort Mission arrived, the soldiers of a certain Volunteer Army loading and unloading unit reduced the time for loading and unloading a carload of materials from four minutes to two and a half minutes; the soldiers of the railway unit repaired many railway tracks destroyed by enemy aircraft overnight; when the representatives arrived at the position of the ninth company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, enemy aircraft were circling in the air, and the anti-aircraft artillerymen immediately carried out anti-aircraft fire, hitting an enemy aircraft with only sixteen shells. The company commander pointed to the enemy aircraft that was falling down in black smoke and said, "This is our gift to the people of the motherland and the Comfort Mission!" After the second sub-group of the Comfort Mission arrived at a certain Volunteer Army unit on the Kaesong front, they counterattacked the enemy on Hill 454 and an unnamed hill on the east bank of the Shagawa River. Only nine minutes after the battle began, they broke through the enemy's position and wiped out more than 130 enemy troops. After repelling more than forty enemy assaults on the Shangganling front, the comfort items from the people of the motherland were delivered to the tunnels. They immediately stood in front of the comfort items, raised their fists, and vowed: "We will resolutely fight to the end for peace, to answer the care of the people of the motherland!" That night, they cooperated with the counterattack troops to wipe out an entire reinforced company of the enemy entrenched around the tunnels. A certain unit also annihilated an entire company of the British army in an ambush on the night of the arrival of the sixth sub-group of the Comfort Mission. In the month of October alone, a certain Volunteer Army unit, under the slogan of "Welcome the Comfort Mission from the Motherland with the Victory of Battle," wiped out more than 19,000 enemy troops and shot down or damaged 129 enemy aircraft. In the second-line units, the soldiers all used practical actions of studying tactical techniques and working hard to learn culture to welcome the Comfort Mission.

After listening to the representatives' reports on the brilliant achievements of the motherland's construction cause over the past three years, the morale of the soldiers on the front line of the Volunteer Army was even more uplifted. The commander of a certain division led the soldiers to swear to the Comfort Mission: "Under the care of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland, we will resolutely fight to the end, fight to victory, and fight until American imperialism is willing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis!" Chai Chuanruo, a representative of the Volunteer Army returning to China, also led the 1,500 people present to solemnly swear an oath after listening to the report of the representative of the Comfort Mission.

The Korean People's Army and the Korean people expressed their infinite gratitude and welcome for the great assistance and deep慰问 (comfort) of the Chinese people. Hong Qiyang, chairman of the People's Committee of Jeongju County in Korea, said at the welcome meeting for the first sub-group: "With the help of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the grain output of our entire county this year has increased by 30% compared with last year. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army not only helped us defeat the American aggressors, but also helped us carry out production and construction." At the banquet held by the Chinese and Korean railway workers in Pyongyang, Korean worker Hong Zizhen said: "Every victory of the Chinese people in various constructions has brought great encouragement to the Korean people." When the sixth sub-group of the Comfort Mission went to the east coast to comfort a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, the soldiers lined up in a welcome queue more than 1,000 meters long, and the cheers shook the valleys, carrying the representatives all the way from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain. The people of the heroic city of Wonsan Port also welcomed the Chinese People's Comfort Mission with the greatest enthusiasm. An old Korean man traveled thirty li from Wonsan to present the Comfort Mission with a bag of white rice harvested this year. Another woman named Kim Do-soon excitedly handed the Comfort Mission a gold ring that her husband had left her as a souvenir when he joined the army, and requested that it be brought back to China and given to a wife who encouraged her husband to join the army like her. Old Mother Kim Jeong-seon, a military dependent, also handed over two beloved rings to the Comfort Mission, requesting that they be given to the great Chinese mothers who sent their sons to the front lines to defend the motherland and defend peace.

    各分团的代表们，为了完成全国人民所托付的神圣使命，不顾辛苦与危险，紧张和热忱地进行慰问活动。第一分团的代表、全国特等劳动模范、天津造纸第一分厂副厂长宋春化，带病涉过海滩上一尺多深的烂泥，去到海岛上慰问守卫海防的英雄战士。天津铁路管理局王省三、吉林铁路管理局田忠林等八人，冒着大雨步行十多里，去到铁道部队进行慰问，他们并在登高英雄杨连第等烈士的墓前献花致祭。第二、五两个分团的代表，为了要和战斗在最前线的战士们握手，有的代表到了曾经使英国帮凶军遭到重创的马良山下；有的代表到了美国侵略军曾经在那里受到惨重打击的砂川河畔的“红山包”。第三分团的代表们曾冒着大雨，翻越二十多里的大山，通过敌人炮火封锁线，到白马山附近的高崖山、晓星山前沿阵地慰问自十月六日以来歼敌八千余人的英雄部队。有些代表还到上甘岭前线慰问顽强地进行了六昼夜坑道战、打退敌人二十次冲锋的机枪班长卢何等英雄们。第六分团的代表曾携带毛主席纪念章，深入到文登公路一带前沿阵地慰问坚守四百天的某部功臣团，并写信向坚守鱼隐山阵地的英雄们致敬。第七分团全体代表、文艺工作团团员和工作人员，在朝鲜期间一直紧张地工作着。农民代表徐连生出国前每天施行腹部手术，但他依然和其他代表一样，晚上行军，白天工作。文艺工作团团员、民间艺人佟雨田跌伤了脚，血流不止，他让人家扶着，忍着疼痛说完了一段相声。有些代表在慰问过程中跑了五千多里路，有些代表到过著名的道峰山营、马良山英雄连、三八线尖刀英雄连、守备英雄连、牛角峰英雄连、遵纪爱民模范排等单位，并且访问了特等功臣黄丑和、刘继和、关崇贵、胡金华，守备英雄孙荣昌，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄李英春。
    中国人民志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们都用万分兴奋的心情欢迎祖国人民的使者。战斗在火线上的志愿军战士们，在坑道门口扎上松门，贴上“迎接亲人”、“以战斗的胜利迎接祖国人民的使者”等标语。战士们敲打着用敌人的炮弹壳制成的锣、钹、皮鼓等乐器欢迎慰问团，用最好的食物和自己种植的蔬菜来招待慰问团，并且让出自己修建的装有暖炕编有门牌的房子和防空掩体给慰问团的代表们居住。有的部队还请代表们住在战士们自建的二层楼的房屋里，楼前有花草、鱼池和用野藤编成的长围凳。战士们还热情地请代表们在用敌人的汽油筒做成的澡盆里洗澡。各部队并演出了战士们自编自演的生动活泼的欢迎节目。
    志愿军各部队还用战斗的胜利迎接慰问团的到来。志愿军装卸部队某部的战士们在慰问团第一分团到来时将装卸一车物资的时间从四分钟减到两分半钟；铁道部队的战士们一夜就抢修好了被敌机炸坏的许多铁轨；代表们来到高射炮某部第九连阵地时，敌机正在空中盘旋，高射炮手们马上进行对空射击，仅仅打出十六发炮弹就击中了一架敌机。该连连长指着正在冒着黑烟掉下来的敌机说：“这就算是我们送给祖国人民和慰问团的礼物吧！”开城前线志愿军某部在慰问团第二分团来到该部以后，就分别反击砂川河东岸四五·四高地和一处无名高地上的敌人，战斗发起后仅九分钟，就突破了敌军阵地，歼灭敌军一百三十多人。上甘岭前线志愿军战士们在打退敌人四十余次冲锋后，正好祖国人民的慰问品送到了坑道里，他们当即站在慰问品前举拳宣誓：“坚决为和平战斗到底，回答祖国人民的关怀！”当晚，他们就配合反击部队将盘踞在坑道四周的敌人的一个加强连全部歼灭。某部在慰问团第六分团来到的晚上，也用伏击战全歼英军一个连。仅十月份一个月中，志愿军某部在“以战斗的胜利欢迎祖国慰问团”的口号下，就歼敌一万九千多人，击落击伤敌机一百二十九架。在第二线的部队，战士们都用钻研战术技术、努力学习文化的实际行动来迎接慰问团。
    前线志愿军战士们在听了代表们关于祖国三年来建设事业的辉煌成就的报告后，士气更加振奋。某师师首长带领战士们向慰问团宣誓：“我们在毛主席和祖国人民的关怀下，坚决打到底，打到胜利，打到美帝国主义愿意在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题！”志愿军归国代表柴川若在听了慰问团代表的报告后，也带领到会的一千五百人庄严地宣了誓。
    朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民对中国人民的巨大援助和深切慰问表示无限的感激和欢迎。朝鲜定州郡人民委员会委员长洪琦杨在欢迎第一分团的大会上说：“在中国人民志愿军的帮助下，我们全郡今年粮食的产量比去年提高了百分之三十。中国人民志愿军不仅帮助我们打败了美国侵略者，而且还帮助我们进行生产建设。”在平壤中朝铁路职工举行的欢宴会上，朝鲜职工洪子贞说：“中国人民在各项建设上的每一个胜利，都给朝鲜人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。”慰问团第六分团在东海岸去慰问朝鲜人民军某部时，战士们排成一千多公尺长的欢迎队伍，欢呼声震响山谷，把代表们一直从山脚抬到山上。英雄城市元山港的人民也用最大的热情欢迎中国人民慰问团。一位朝鲜老人从三十里外赶到元山，向慰问团献上一包今年丰收的白米。另一位叫金稻顺的妇女，兴奋地把她丈夫在参军时留给她的纪念物——金戒指交给慰问团，请求带回中国转送给和她一样鼓励丈夫参军的妻子。军属老妈妈金贞先也将两只心爱的戒指交慰问团，请求转送给把儿子送到保卫祖国、保卫和平最前线的伟大的中国母亲。
