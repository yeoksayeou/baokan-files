　　Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative Achieves All-Around Bumper Harvest in Cotton Fields

　　After learning from Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience this year, the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiliang Village, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, achieved an all-around bumper harvest on its 118.8 mu of cotton fields. Among them, 80.03 mu of irrigated land yielded an average of 532.75 jin of seed cotton per mu; 38.05 mu of dry land yielded an average of 345.25 jin of seed cotton per mu. The average yield of all irrigated and dry land reached more than 470 jin, exceeding last year's average yield per mu by 70 percent, exceeding Cheng Lifang's mutual aid team, which had the highest yield in Xiliang Village this year, by 62 percent, and equivalent to one and a half times the average yield of cotton fields of ordinary farmers in Xiliang Village. Moreover, they had 5 mu of high-yield cotton fields, with an average yield of 1,021.3 jin of seed cotton per mu, breaking the national record for cotton unit area yield created by Qu Yaoli last year. This year, the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative first learned Qu Yaoli's intensive planting experience. They also realized that intensive planting needs to be coordinated with fertilization. The high-yield cotton fields grew uniformly and the cotton bolls were plump because of the increased application of manure and timely multiple top dressings. In addition, they also attached great importance to irrigation and seed selection. They also learned and adopted early, dense, and late seedling retention methods, and timely and reasonable pruning and disbudding. The cooperative's cotton not only did not have red flowers, but the pre-frost flower yield reached 85 percent, and the post-frost flower yield accounted for only 15 percent; the pre-frost yield of high-yield cotton fields even reached over 87 percent.

　　Tianjin Establishes Short-Term Training Class for Advanced Experience in the Construction Industry

　　In order to promote advanced experience in the construction industry in an organized and planned way, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Working Committee of the Construction Trade Union of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions established a short-term training class for advanced experience in the construction industry in Tianjin on December 22. The students who came to the school included advanced workers and construction site engineering technicians in the construction industry from North China, East China, Central South, Northwest, Southwest, and Northeast China.

　　The main purpose of this class is to study and promote advanced experience in the construction industry. The course content includes Wang Sunci's segmented parallel flow operation method for civil engineering construction, Su Changyou's advanced bricklaying method, Yang Dezhong's continuous plastering operation method, Xie Wanfu's woodworking flow operation method, Wang Demao's reinforcing bar flow operation method, and Zhang Deqing's concrete flow operation method. The teachers are all advanced producers from the Northeast region.

　　Tangshan Railway Factory Completes 490 Freight Car Task Ahead of Schedule

　　On December 18, the Tangshan Railway Factory had completed its annual task of manufacturing 490 new freight cars.

　　The main reason why the factory was able to complete the task ahead of schedule was the study of advanced Soviet experience. The freight car workshop learned advanced experience such as the Soviet flow operation method, rapid riveting method, and horizontal operation method. The parts workshop implemented the multi-tool and multi-edge working method. The foundry implemented advanced mold-leakage method and vibrators. The office of the new freight car workshop also implemented various charts and rhythmic production. Another reason why the freight car task was completed ahead of schedule was that the freight car workshop improved work efficiency in the assembly work. In the past, they could only make four cars a day, but later they could make eight cars a day, while ensuring quality.

    吴春安农业生产合作社棉田全部获得丰产
    山西省翼城县西梁村吴春安农业生产合作社，今年学习了曲耀离的植棉先进经验后，一百一十八亩八分棉田全部获得丰产。其中八十亩零三分水地，每亩平均产籽棉五百三十二斤十二两；三十八亩零五分旱地，每亩平均产籽棉三百四十五斤五两。全部水地、旱地的平均产量达四百七十多斤，超过去年每亩平均产量百分之七十，超过今年西梁村互助组中产量最高的程立方互助组百分之六十二，相当于西梁村一般农户棉田的平均产量一倍半。并且，他们有五亩丰产棉田，每亩平均产籽棉一千零二十一斤六两，突破了去年曲耀离所创造的全国棉花单位面积产量的最高纪录。今年吴春安农业生产合作社首先学习了曲耀离的密植经验。他们还体会到密植需要配合施肥。丰产棉田因为增施厩肥和及时多次追肥，所以棉株生长整齐，棉铃充实。此外，他们也十分重视灌溉和选种工作。他们还学习和采用了早间、密留、晚定的保苗方法，和及时、合理的整枝打杈，全社棉花不但没有红花，而且霜前花产量达到百分之八十五，霜后花产量只占百分之十五；丰产棉田霜前产量更达百分之八十七强。
    天津成立建筑业先进经验短期训练班
    中央建筑工程部和中华全国总工会建筑工会工作委员会，为了有组织有计划地推广建筑业中的先进经验，于十二月二十二日在天津成立了建筑业先进经验短期训练班。到校的学员，有华北、华东、中南、西北、西南、东北等地建筑业中的先进工人，和工地工程技术人员等。
    该班主要目的是：学习与推广建筑业的先进经验，课程的内容有王孙慈的土木建筑分段平行流水作业法，苏长有的先进砌砖法，杨德重的抹灰连续作业法，谢万福的木工流水作业法，王德茂铁筋工流水作业法，张德庆混凝土流水作业法等。教员都是由东北区各先进生产者担任。
    唐山铁路工厂提前完成四百九十台货车任务
    十二月十八日，唐山铁路工厂已完成全年四百九十台新造货车的任务。
    该厂所以能提前完成任务的主要原因，是学习了苏联先进经验。货车场学习了苏联的流水作业法、快速铆钉法、横作业法等先进经验，配件场实行了多刀多刃工作法，翻砂场实行了先进漏模法和震模器等，新造货车场办公室又施行了各种图表制和有节奏的生产。货车任务能够提前完成的另一个原因，是货车场在装配工作中，提高了工作效率。他们在过去每天只能做四台车，后来每天能做八台车，还保证了质量。
