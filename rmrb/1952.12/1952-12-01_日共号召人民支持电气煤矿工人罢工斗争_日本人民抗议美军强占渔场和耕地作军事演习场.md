Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: News from Tokyo: Japanese workers' strike struggles for improved living conditions are continuing, and the number of participating unions and workers is also constantly increasing.

Electrical workers, who have already held ten strikes, held their eleventh power outage strike on the 21st and 22nd. The strike on the 21st interrupted the power supply to 834 large factories across Japan. According to the union authorities, the losses of just 743 large factories up to the tenth strike amounted to 4 billion yen.

Japanese monopoly capitalist groups are plotting to divide the coal miners' strike, which has persisted for more than a month. However, workers belonging to the unions of major coal companies are still坚持斗争 （persisting in the struggle）. The strike has already reduced railway transportation in Hokkaido by 12 to 25 percent, and gas companies are also preparing to limit gas supply due to the impact of the coal mine strike.

In addition, the All Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union is also preparing to launch a strike. This union, with 30,000 members, is scheduled to implement a 24-hour strike across the country on November 27 to demand higher wages and will continue to hold indefinite strikes after the 30th.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: News from Tokyo: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 8th, calling on the Japanese working class and the people of the whole country to actively support the strike struggle of electrical workers and coal miners and to expand the battle line to strive for the victory of the struggle.

The statement pointed out: The problem of coal and electricity has become a serious issue related to the entire Japanese industry. Japan's coal and electricity monopoly capitalists, colluding with the American and Japanese reactionaries, are attempting to turn coal and electricity into a lever for the militarization of the entire industry, strengthen monopoly and concentration, and raise prices to achieve their goal of thoroughly exploiting the people of the whole country. Coal miners and electrical workers have launched a strike struggle in order to demand survival. Their demands are closely linked to the demands of the Japanese people. Only struggle is the only way to lead the strikes of coal miners' unions and electrical industry unions to victory.

The statement pointed out: The struggle of coal miners' unions and electrical industry unions has been prolonged. The struggle is arduous. However, this struggle will never fall into isolation, nor will it lose hope of victory.

The statement finally emphasized: The key to the victory of the struggle lies in expanding the struggle of coal miners' unions and electrical industry unions into the struggle of the entire working class, and further expanding it into the struggle of the people of the whole country. The Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the working class and give all assistance to this struggle. Victory belongs to the working class and the people of the whole country.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: News from Tokyo: Since the signing of the US-Japan military base agreement in July, the Japanese people's struggle against turning their homeland into US military bases has been growing day by day.

According to Kyodo News, "The Japanese government is greatly troubled by public opposition to the establishment of training grounds for the US military stationed in Japan." On the 21st, representatives of residents from Aichi, Shizuoka, and Ishikawa prefectures visited Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kamejiro Hayashiya and gave him a copy of the resolution of local residents, protesting the US military's plan to establish training grounds in these three prefectures. Fishermen living in the Kujukuri Beach area along the Pacific coast of Chiba Prefecture have also lodged a series of protests with the Yoshida government against the US military's long-term use of the area for exercises. The strong protests of the fishermen have forced the American and Japanese reactionaries to decide to reduce the time for military exercises on Kujukuri Beach.

The US occupation army's plan to forcibly occupy the Aonohara area of Kawai Village, Kato County, Hyogo Prefecture, as an air force base has also aroused great anger among the local people. Various local mass organizations have established an "Alliance Against Receiving" and launched a signature campaign against "receiving" cultivated land as military bases. They have also united with the people of Seno Village and Tomiai Village in the neighboring Kasai County to jointly launch a movement against militarization.

    日共号召人民支持电气煤矿工人罢工斗争
    日本人民抗议美军强占渔场和耕地作军事演习场
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：日本工人为改善生活而进行的罢工斗争正在继续进行，参加罢工的工会与工人也在不断增加中。
    已举行过十次罢工的电气工人，在二十一日和二十二日两天又举行了第十一次停电罢工。二十一日的罢工使日本全国八百三十四家大工厂的电力供应中断。据工会当局公布，截至第十次罢工为止，仅七百四十三家大工厂的损失即达四十亿日元。
    日本垄断资本集团正在阴谋分化坚持了一个多月的煤矿工人罢工。但是，属于各大煤矿公司工会的工人仍坚持斗争。罢工已经使北海道的铁道运输减少百分之十二到二十五，煤气公司也因受到煤矿罢工的影响，准备限制煤气供应量。
    此外，准备进行罢工斗争的还有全日本汽车产业工会。这个拥有三万名会员的工会预定于十一月二十七日在全国实行二十四小时罢工，要求提高工资，并将在三十日以后，继续举行无一定期限的罢工。
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部于八日发表文告，号召日本工人阶级和全国人民积极支援电气工人和煤矿工人的罢工斗争，并扩大战线，以争取斗争的胜利。
    文告指出：煤和电力的问题已经成为关系日本整个工业的严重问题。日本的煤和电力垄断资本家与美、日反动派狼狈为奸，企图把煤和电力变成整个工业军事化的杠杆，并加强垄断与集中，提高价格，以达到他们彻底压榨全国人民的目的。煤矿工人和电气工人为了要求生存起来展开了罢工斗争。他们的要求是和日本人民的要求密切相结合的。只有斗争才是引导煤矿工会和电气产业工会的罢工走向胜利的唯一途径。
    文告指出：煤矿工会和电气产业工会的斗争已经长期化了。斗争是艰苦的。然而这个斗争决不会陷于孤立，也不会失去胜利的希望。
    文告最后强调说：斗争的胜利关键在于把煤矿工会和电气产业工会的斗争扩大为整个工人阶级的斗争，进而扩大为日本全国人民的斗争。日本共产党将站在工人阶级的前列，给予这一个斗争以一切的援助。胜利是属于工人阶级和全国人民的。
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：自从七月间美日军事基地协定签订以来，日本人民反对把国土变成美国的军事基地的斗争运动，正在一天天增长。
    据共同社讯，“日本政府因公众反对为驻日美军设立演习场而大伤脑筋”。二十一日，爱知、静冈和石川这三个县的居民代表访问农林相林屋龟次郎，交给他当地居民的决议一份，抗议美军计划在该三个县内设立演习场。居住在千叶县太平洋沿岸九十九里滨海地区的渔民，也曾为了反对美军长时间地利用该地区进行演习，向吉田政府提出了一连串的抗议。渔民的强烈抗议已经迫使美、日反动派不得不决定减少使用九十九里滨海滩进行军事演习的时间。
    美国占领军企图强占兵库县加东郡河合村的青野原地方作为空军基地的计划，也引起了当地人民的极大愤怒。当地各个群众组织建立了“反对接收同盟”，并展开了反对“接收”耕地作为军事基地的签名运动。他们还联合了邻近的加西郡濑野村和富合村的人民，共同展开反对军事基地化运动。
