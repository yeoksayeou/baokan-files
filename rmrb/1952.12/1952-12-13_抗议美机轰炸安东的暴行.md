    Protest the Atrocity of American Aircraft Bombing Antung
    On December 8th, an American invading aircraft bomber intruded into Liaodong Province of our country and bombed Antung City, causing a serious bloody incident. This is another serious crime among the many crimes committed by American aggressors in carrying out armed provocations against our country, despite our country's repeated serious warnings. The people of our country once again lodge a serious protest against this brutal crime of the American aggressors.
    Recently, the American aggressors have intensified their acts of armed provocation against our country. In the ten days from November 29th to December 8th alone, American military aircraft intruded into our country's airspace 31 times, totaling 155 sorties. Such frequent aerial provocations cannot possibly be accidental events, but are clearly planned hostile actions against our country by the United States.
    It must be noted that since the American aggressors brazenly and unilaterally suspended the Korean armistice negotiations, they have deliberately expanded the war in Korea. Especially around Eisenhower's trip to Korea, American newspapers and magazines have constantly revealed various "plans" and "schemes" regarding the United States' preparation to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. The United States International News Service recently reported that the United States Department of Defense is studying a new heinous plan, which includes launching a joint land, sea, and air attack to push the Korean front line north by about 75 miles. American news agencies also revealed that Eisenhower, during his meeting with the land, sea, and air force generals of the US military and the Li pseudo-army in Korea, mentioned "the need to strengthen the US Air Force in Korea" in order to "conduct offensive warfare north of the Yalu River." This shows that the current shameless provocations by American aircraft are entirely planned.
    The American aggressors' dispatch of military aircraft to continuously carry out aerial provocations against our country not only completely exposes Eisenhower's lies about "ending the Korean War," but also shows that the American aggressors are attempting to continue creating a tense situation and creating excuses through these continuous acts of invading our country's airspace, in order to achieve their sinister goals of continuing and expanding the war. However, we must point out that such stupid and shameless adventurous behavior by the aggressors can only bring them greater defeat and a more tragic end.
    The people of our country will never lightly let go of the aggressors, we must never lightly forget the damage and destruction they have inflicted on us, we must continue to resist America and aid Korea, and defeat the American wolf!

### 抗议美机轰炸安东的暴行

    抗议美机轰炸安东的暴行
    侵朝美军轰炸机一架，于本月八日，侵入我国辽东省，并向安东市实行轰炸，造成严重血案。这是美国侵略者不顾我国一再严重警告，向我国实行武装挑衅的许多罪行中的又一严重罪行。我国人民对美国侵略者的这种残暴罪行再次提出严重的抗议。
    美国侵略者对我国的武装挑衅行为最近更是变本加厉了。仅自十一月二十九日到本月八日的十天内，美国军用飞机侵入我国领空即达三十一批，一百五十五架次。这样经常的、频繁的空中挑衅行动，绝不可能是偶然的事件，而显然是美国有计划的对我国的敌对行动。
    人们必须注意到，美国侵略者自从悍然片面地停止朝鲜停战谈判以来，即蓄意扩大在朝鲜的战争。尤其是在艾森豪威尔朝鲜之行前后，美国报章杂志更不断透露关于美国准备继续进行和扩大侵朝战争的各种各样的“计划”和“方案”。美国国际新闻社最近报道，美国国防部正在研究一个新的罪恶计划，这个计划包括发动一次陆、海、空联合攻击，以便把朝鲜战线向北推进约七十五英里。美国通讯社还透露，艾森豪威尔在朝鲜和美军及李伪军的陆海空军将领会谈时，曾提起了“美国在朝鲜空军需要加强”，以便“在鸭绿江以北进行攻势战争”。这就说明了现在美机的无耻挑衅完全是有计划的。
    美国侵略者派遣军用飞机不断向我国进行空中挑衅，不仅完全拆穿了艾森豪威尔的“结束朝鲜战争”的谎言，而且也说明：美国侵略者正企图以这种连续不断侵犯我国领空的行为来继续制造紧张的局势并制造藉口，以达到他们继续进行战争和扩大战争的罪恶目的。但是，我们必须指出：侵略者的这种愚蠢而无耻的冒险行为，只能为他们自己招来更大的失败和更为悲惨的下场。
    我国人民绝不会轻轻放过侵略者，我们绝不能把他们加于我们的损伤和破坏轻轻忘掉，我们一定要继续抗美援朝，打败美国野心狼！
