    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. On the 4th, the U.S. side again injured 11 of our captured personnel on Koje Island. The U.S. side announced the reason for the assault was that one prisoner of war allegedly tried to "escape," and the rest allegedly "refused to obey orders." It is not the first time that the U.S. side has used the so-called "forcible execution of orders" as an excuse to kill and wound prisoners of war who firmly demand repatriation. Regardless of the truth of the matter, the U.S. side's excuse itself is illegal. Article 89 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Disciplinary punishments shall in no case be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to the health of prisoners of war." The U.S. side is now openly using this act of recklessly violating the Geneva Convention as an excuse to persecute prisoners of war, which is a great irony for those who keep saying that the U.S. side is forcibly detaining prisoners of war in order to uphold the Geneva Convention.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. On December 4th, the U.S. side again injured 11 of our captured personnel in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, protested to the other side on December 8th, pointing out that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the war crimes of abusing and killing prisoners of war.

    南日将军抗议美方又在巨济岛打伤战俘
    【新华社开城八日电】美方四日又在巨济岛上打伤我方被俘人员十一名。美方宣布行凶的理由是：一名战俘据说因为企图“逃跑”，其余的据说是因为“拒绝服从命令”。美方用所谓“武力执行命令”的藉口来打死打伤那些坚决要求遣返的战俘，这已经不是第一次。姑且不论事实真相如何，美方的这种藉口本身就是非法的。日内瓦公约第八十九条规定：“纪律性处罚绝不得非人道、残暴，或危害战俘健康。”美方现在公然拿着这种肆无忌惮地破坏日内瓦公约的行为当作迫害战俘的藉口，对于那些口口声声说美方是为了维护日内瓦公约而强迫扣留战俘的人，是一个绝大的讽刺。
    【新华社开城八日电】十二月四日，美方在巨济岛战俘营又打伤我方被俘人员十一人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十二月八日向对方提出抗议，指出美方必须对虐杀战俘的战争罪行负完全责任。
