    Northeast Coal Mine Drilling Project Exceeds Annual Plan
    Tianjin Steel Plant's Liu Changfu Group Completes Annual Production Increase and Savings Plan Twenty-Seven Days Ahead of Schedule
    The Northeast Coal Mine drilling project exceeded its annual drilling plan by four percent at the end of November. Among them, the Xi'an Mining Bureau completed 224 percent of the plan, and the Fuxin Mining Bureau completed 132 percent.
    Although the drilling task of the Northeast coal mine department this year has increased by two times compared with last year, all drilling workers have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, learned from the advanced Soviet drilling experience, and vigorously promoted the rapid drilling experience of the Ma Wenzhi group, enabling the drilling plan to be completed ahead of schedule. According to statistics in September, there were already forty-eight Ma Wenzhi-style advanced drilling groups in the entire Northeast region. Among them, Wang Shuchun's group from the Hegang Mining Bureau set a new record of 50.2 meters per day in October, and Ren Guoji's group from Yingcheng Mine set a new record of 436 meters per safe month. Due to the vigorous promotion of advanced experience and the continuous emergence of new drilling records, the labor productivity of coal mine drilling workers in the entire Northeast region has significantly improved. For example, taking the average daily progress of each drilling rig in April this year as 100, it increased to 152.2 in May and 168.1 in August. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The Liu Changfu group of the wire rod department of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant completed its annual production increase and savings plan of 17.3 billion yuan on the 4th of this month, twenty-seven days ahead of schedule. All workers in the group jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to report the good news and proposed to guarantee an additional 1.87 billion yuan in production increases and savings for the country by the end of the year.
    The Liu Changfu group was able to complete the annual production increase and savings plan ahead of schedule mainly because it implemented a scientific economic accounting system within the group, carried out a series of technical reforms, and implemented group cost accounting, carefully calculating the use of all raw materials and man-hours. On the other hand, the group also formulated technical operation cards and established a system of holding regular technical research meetings and life review meetings, so it further strengthened the unity of workers and technicians and solved technical problems in production. For example, when revising the production increase and savings plan in the fourth quarter, the group's accounting revealed that the key to increasing machine-hour output was to improve the operating method and give full play to the utilization rate of the steel heating furnace. After the entire group studied and improved the firing method, the machine-hour output increased by more than seven percent. At present, the Liu Changfu group is deeply developing a quality improvement movement in conjunction with the verification work, striving to over fulfill the newly revised production increase and savings plan.

    东北煤矿钻探工程超额完成全年计划
    天津钢厂刘长福小组提前二十七天完成全年增产节约计划
    东北煤矿钻探工程已于十一月底超额百分之四完成了全年钻探计划。其中西安矿务局完成计划百分之二百二十四，阜新矿务局完成百分之一百三十二。
    今年东北煤矿部门的钻探任务虽然比去年增加了两倍，但全体钻探职工发挥了高度的劳动积极性，学习了苏联先进的钻探经验，大力推广了马文志小组的快速钻探经验，使钻探计划得以提前完成。据九月份的统计，全东北已出现了四十八个马文志式先进钻探小组。其中鹤岗矿务局王树春小组十月份曾创日进五十点二公尺的新纪录，营城矿任国吉小组曾创安全月进四百三十六公尺的新纪录。由于大力推广了先进经验和钻探新纪录的不断出现，东北全区煤矿钻探工人的劳动生产率已显著提高。如以今年四月份每台钻探机平均日进度为一百计算，五月份就提高到一百五十二点二，八月份又提高到一百六十八点一。（新华社）
    国营天津钢厂线材部刘长福小组在本月四日提前二十七天完成了全年增产节约一百七十三亿元的计划。全组工人特联名写信向毛主席报捷，并提出在年底保证再为国家增产节约十八亿七千万元。
    刘长福小组能够提前完成全年增产节约计划，主要是由于在小组内实行了科学的经济核算制，进行了一系列的技术改革工作，并实行了小组成本核算，对一切原料、工时的使用，都经过精打细算。另一方面，小组又制订了技术操作卡片，建立了定期召开技术研究会和生活检讨会的制度，所以进一步加强了工人和技术人员的团结，解决了生产中的技术问题。如在第四季度修订增产节约计划时，通过小组核算，发现提高机时产量的关键在于改进操作法，充分发挥烘钢炉的利用率。经过全组工人研究并改进烧火方法后，机时产量就提高了百分之七以上。目前刘长福小组正在结合查定工作，深入开展提高质量运动，为超额完成新增订的增产节约计划而奋斗。（新华社）
