    The Good Results of the "Marriage Law Propaganda Shed" in Deyang County

    Editor: In October of this year, the preparatory committee of the Democratic Women's Federation of Deyang County, Sichuan, conducted a lively publicity campaign on the Marriage Law at the county's material exchange fair. This publicity was concentrated in a Marriage Law propaganda shed. The propaganda shed was decorated with "Illustrated Marriage Law" and the serial pictures of "Xie Guanghua Killing His Wife," drawn by the County Fine Arts Workers Association, as well as paintings such as "Cheng Shuangyu's Emancipation" and "Widow Remarriage." In addition, local performing arts groups put on short plays such as "Marriage" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." Furthermore, physical objects from marriage cases were displayed. The explanation work during the publicity campaign was mainly carried out by mobilizing more than forty activists from the masses to participate. Before participating in the explanation work, they had undergone concentrated study and had a preliminary understanding of the Marriage Law. This publicity lasted for nine days, from October 15th to October 23rd. At the beginning, commentators attracted the audience to visit the shed. Gradually, the audience came automatically, and in increasing numbers, totaling more than 50,000 people, accounting for more than a quarter of the county's population. These more than 50,000 viewers generally received education on the Marriage Law. Some reflected: "I will not beat women anymore." "Marriage problems are caused by feudal society." Woman Li Chen said: "I will work hard in production from now on. It was wrong not to work before." On the spot, seventeen couples raised issues of dissatisfaction with their marriages and requested solutions. Ten couples expressed their willingness to divorce. Seven couples were introduced to the County People's Court to resolve their marriage problems. Excitingly, forty-five couples who were already mature in their relationships requested to get married on the spot. In addition, the audience raised many questions about marriage and requested answers. The questions raised by sixty-three people were answered on the spot. More than twenty people also put forward opinions on how to severely punish criminals who abuse and kill women and infants. Such publicity has indeed achieved very good results.

    德阳县“婚姻法宣传棚”的效果好
    编辑同志：今年十月间，四川德阳县民主妇联筹委会，在本县物资交流大会上生动地进行了一次关于婚姻法的宣传。这宣传是集中在一个婚姻法宣传棚里进行的。宣传棚里陈设着县美术工作者协会负责绘制的“婚姻法图解”和“谢光华杀妻”的连环画，以及“程双玉翻身”、“寡妇再嫁”等画。并由县里的文娱团体配合演出“结婚”、“王贵与李香香”等活报剧。另外，还陈设了婚姻案中的实物。关于宣传时的解说工作，主要是发动群众中的四十多个积极分子参加的。他们参加解说工作之前，曾经集中学习，对婚姻法都有了初步的认识。这一宣传，从十月十五日到十月二十三日止，共九天。开始时，由解说员招引观众进棚内参观。渐渐地，观众就自动来了，越来越多，先后约五万多人，占全县人口四分之一以上。这五万多观众普遍受到了关于婚姻法的教育。有的反映：“我以后不打女人了。”“婚姻问题是封建社会造成的。”妇女李陈氏说：“我以后要好好生产了，以前不劳动是不对的。”当场有十七对男女提出对婚姻不满的问题要求解决。十对男女双方表示自愿离婚。七对男女当场被介绍到县人民法院去解决婚姻问题。令人兴奋的，是当场就有四十五对已经恋爱成熟的男女要求结婚。此外，观众还提出了许多有关婚姻的问题要求解答。其中有六十三人提出的问题，当场得到了答复。还有二十多人，对严惩虐杀妇女、婴儿等罪犯的问题提出了处理意见。这样的宣传，效果的确很好。
