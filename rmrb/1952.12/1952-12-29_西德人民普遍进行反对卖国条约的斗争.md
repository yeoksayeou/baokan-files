Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th dispatch from TASS: The West German people's struggle against the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty is intensifying. Recently, residents and workers' representatives from various districts near Nuremberg jointly held a rally to protest the ratification of the traitorous treaties. Large slogans such as "We demand all-German negotiations" were painted on the streets of many areas of Nuremberg. At a conference held by the "People's Association Against War" in Kiel, Oberhof, a well-known West German peace fighter and pastor, called out: To answer the Adenauer government's actions, the German people should redouble their efforts to save German unity. His words were warmly welcomed. In Hanover, young peace fighters distributed many anti-war leaflets. In the Kassel region, thirty-nine mayors jointly protested the ratification of the Bonn war treaty, and more than a thousand residents of Bremerhaven wrote letters to the Bonn Federal Assembly lodging the same protest.

The West German organization for promoting mutual understanding and the conclusion of a just peace treaty for the German people announced that as of December 18th, 14,118,219 people in West Germany had voted in opinion polls against the Bonn war treaty and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. During and after the second reading debate in the Bonn Federal Assembly on the Bonn and Paris treaties, 818,326 West German residents voted against these two war treaties in four days. After the West German "Chancellor" Adenauer was forced to postpone the third reading of the Bonn and Paris war treaties in the Federal Assembly in early December, he is stepping up behind-the-scenes activities in an attempt to clear the way for the final ratification of these two traitorous treaties. Recently, Adenauer used enormous pressure to prevent the West German "Federal Constitutional Court" from discussing whether the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" agreement were in accordance with the Bonn Constitution, and demanded that the West German "President" Heuss withdraw the question he had raised to the "Federal Constitutional Court." Heuss had raised this question to the "Federal Constitutional Court" a few months ago, merely to create a "legal" cloak for the West German ruling group's traitorous behavior. However, now Adenauer has become impatient, and at the same time, he is afraid that under the rising tide of the West German people's opposition, the court might pass a decision unfavorable to the Federal Assembly's ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties. Therefore, he demanded that the plenary session of the "Federal Constitutional Court," which was discussing this issue, cease its meeting. At the same time, in order to make Heuss immediately withdraw the question he had raised in the past, he even dispatched police to surround the presidential residence. This incident shows that under the urging of the American masters, the West German traitorous group headed by Adenauer has disregarded even the "constitutional" facade, which was merely for show. Adenauer's actions have aroused dissatisfaction even among some West German bourgeois elements. The "Frankfurter Rundschau" pointed out that Adenauer's actions were a "political and moral failure."

    西德人民普遍进行反对卖国条约的斗争
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：西德人民反对波恩条约和巴黎条约的斗争在加紧进行中。最近，纽伦堡附近各区的居民与工人代表联合举行了抗议批准卖国条约的大会。在纽伦堡许多区域的街道上都刷上了“我们要求举行全德谈判”的大字标语。在基尔“人民反对战争协会”所举行的一次大会上，西德著名的和平战士奥柏霍甫牧师号召：为了回答阿登纳政府的行动，德国人民应加倍努力拯救德国的统一。他的话受到了热烈的欢迎。在汉诺威，青年和平战士们散发了许多反对战争的传单。在卡塞尔地区，三十九个镇长联名抗议批准波恩战争条约，不来梅港的一千多居民写信给波恩联邦议院提出同样的抗议。
    西德争取德国人民相互谅解和缔结公正和约组织宣布，到十二月十八日为止，西德已有一千四百十一万八千二百一十九人在民意测验中投票，反对波恩战争条约而要求缔结对德和约。在波恩联邦议院二读通过波恩和巴黎条约的辩论期间和辩论之后，四天内就有八十一万八千三百二十六个西德居民投票反对这两个战争条约。西德波恩“总理”阿登纳在十二月初被迫把联邦议院关于波恩及巴黎战争条约的三读延期以后，正加紧进行幕后活动，企图为最后批准这两个卖国条约扫清道路。最近，阿登纳使用巨大的压力，制止西德“联邦宪法法院”讨论“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”协定是否合乎波恩宪法的问题，并要求西德“总统”休斯撤回他向“联邦宪法法院”提出的这个问题。休斯在几个月以前把这个问题向“联邦宪法法院”提出，无非是为了给西德统治集团的卖国行为制造“合法”的外衣。但是，现在阿登纳已经迫不及待，同时又害怕在西德人民反对的怒潮下法院可能通过不利于联邦议院批准波恩和巴黎条约的决定，因此，他要求正在讨论这一问题的“联邦宪法法院”全体会议停止召开，同时，为了要休斯立即撤回他过去提出的问题，竟出动警察包围总统官邸。这个事件说明了在美国主人的督促下，以阿登纳为首的西德卖国集团已顾不得甚至不过是装装门面的“宪法”外表。阿登纳的行为，连某些西德资产阶级也表示不满。“法兰克福评论”指出，阿登纳这样行动是一次“政治上和道义上的失败”。
