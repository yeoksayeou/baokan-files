    Anda Post Office Leaders Should Adjust Employees' Working Hours

    To the Editor: The leaders of the Anda Post Office in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, do not care about the health of their workers and arbitrarily extend their working hours. Because the workers' working hours are too long and they do not get enough sleep, they doze off during the day. For example, the employees of the first team of the postal group of the bureau sometimes go to work from 5:00 am and do not get off work until 8:30 pm. After eating, they have to go to work again at 9:30 pm to process various documents and do not return home to eat until 2:00 am. Then, at 3:00 am, they have to continue working until they finish their work at 9:00 am the next morning. The second team of the postal group is the delivery team. The deliverymen go to work at 5:00 am, rest at 1:30 pm, go to work at 5:00 pm, and finish work at 9:00 pm. The third team of the postal group is responsible for rural postal work. The rural postmen go to work at 5:00 am, go to the countryside at 7:00 am, return to the bureau to rest at 3:00 or 4:00 pm, and continue working from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm. This team has no system of Sunday rest or holidays at all. The phenomenon of excessively long working hours has existed since January of this year. The employees are very tired after work. Every day when they go to bed, they feel sore in their backs and legs, and they barely manage to work during the day. Old worker Qu Ruilin said: "If I am always asked to work like this, it will be difficult for me to study." The employees have raised their concerns with the leaders of the bureau several times, requesting a solution to this problem, but the bureau's administration has ignored them, and the trade union has remained indifferent.

    I believe that it is a serious problem for workers not to have sufficient rest and study time. I hope that the leaders of the Anda Post Office will quickly resolve these issues and conduct a self-criticism. Lu Ruibin

### 安达邮电局领导方面应调整职工工作时间

    安达邮电局领导方面应调整职工工作时间
    编辑同志：黑龙江省安达县安达邮电局领导方面不关心工人身体健康，随意延长工人工作时间。工人因为工作时间过长，睡眠不足，在白天工作时都打瞌睡。如该局邮政组第一小组的职工，有时候从早上五时上班，到晚间八时半才下班，吃过饭，九时半又要上班，处理各种单据，夜间二时回家吃饭，三时又要接着工作，直到第二天早上九时才能做完工作。邮政组第二小组是投递组，投递员在早上五时上班，下午一时半休息，五时上班，工作到晚上九时始毕。邮政组第三小组是做乡邮工作的，乡邮员在早上五时上班，七时下乡，下午三、四时回局休息，六时到九时又要继续工作，这个小组根本就没有星期日休息和放假的制度。自今年一月起到现在，一直存在着工作时间过长的现象。职工们工作之后，非常疲倦，每天睡觉时，都感到腰酸腿疼，白天工作则是勉强支持。老工人曲瑞林说：“老叫我这样干，不学习可够呛。”职工们曾向该局领导方面提过数次意见，要求解决这个问题，但该局行政方面置之不理，而工会也不闻不问。
    我认为工人没有充分休息时间和学习时间是很严重的问题。我希望安达邮电局领导方面，迅速解决这些问题，并作检讨。鲁瑞斌
