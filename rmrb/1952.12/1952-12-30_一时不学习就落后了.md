Falling Behind If You Don't Study For a While
Sun Jingyun, Secretary of the Mengkeli Village Branch of the Communist Party of China, Zhaoyuan County

I was elected as the Party Branch Secretary of this village in 1949. Coming from a background of driving carts and working as a farmhand, I thought leading agricultural production was simple and nothing special, so I didn't bother to study policies and agricultural techniques much. Because I didn't study, I couldn't improve myself, and I couldn't effectively utilize everyone's strength in my work. The Party branch committee didn't have a clear division of labor, so I was doing everything myself, and everyone pushed responsibility onto others when problems arose. I was so busy all day long that my feet barely touched the ground, running wherever a problem occurred in any group. I also didn't have a clear understanding of the direction of rural economic development, and my work wasn't thorough. I also couldn't discover the good experiences created by the farmers. I didn't have anything new to say to the masses at mass meetings, so I had to say things like: "Pull and harvest quickly, be thorough and clean..." People didn't want to listen, and after the meeting, they complained: "It's still the same old stuff!" Some people didn't even attend at all, like Tao Qingchun, who said: "I'm not going, it's just production anyway, who doesn't know!" Liu Mingchen would fall asleep as soon as he got to the meeting. He said: "I know everything, I don't need to listen."

This year, the district committee called for the implementation of the new cultivation method of "equal distance wide sowing, seedling thinning to protect seedlings, and applying fertilizer in stages." I had a way to lead the villagers to improve agricultural technology and produce more grain, so I was determined to promote it in our village. From this point on, I began to learn to use my brain.

During the preparations for cultivation, I held a branch committee meeting with great enthusiasm to discuss this matter. However, many people couldn't understand it. Some said: "It's never been heard of since ancient times." Others said: "It's simply impossible." Later, District Committee Secretary Wang Huanzhang came and thoroughly criticized the conservative thinking by calculating detailed accounts, which improved the understanding of the branch committee, and we decided to implement it among the masses. We had no experience at the beginning, and Zhang Guifang's group's experiment failed, causing a lot of discussion among the villagers. The old men opposed it even more, and they talked about it whenever they got together. Some said: "This is just nonsense!" Others said: "The cadres have nothing to do, what are they doing staying there, just twiddling their thumbs!"

At this time, I felt that it was impossible to complete this task by myself, and it was necessary to utilize everyone's strength. The branch committee divided the work: Li Zhenjiu (the village chief) was responsible for administrative and youth league work, Xiao Pintang (female) was responsible for women's work, Tang Wanfang was responsible for propaganda network work, and other branch committee members were also assigned work. In addition to being fully responsible, I also personally took charge of the work of the technology research committee. In addition, the branch committee strengthened leadership of the mutual aid groups, inspecting each other once every seven days, and solving problems at the branch committee meetings. Through various organizations, the branch understood the masses' thoughts and problems in production, and the work became more proactive. In this way, the branch became a strong leading core, and all organizations were closely united around the branch, forming a strong organizational force. The branch also designated the groups of Fu Baoshan and Wang Molin as key groups, and through the activists in the groups (all of whom were Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, or technicians), led everyone to set an example and then promoted it throughout the village.

After the branch grasped a large number of Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, technicians, and key groups, it organized these forces to launch a struggle against conservative thinking. By checking the spacing, measuring the ears of grain, and summarizing the past experiences of producing more grain, we implemented the new technology of "equal distance wide sowing, seedling thinning to protect seedlings, and applying fertilizer in stages." The conservative thinking of the old men was difficult to overcome, so I personally held a meeting of the old men, explained it to them, and measured the ears of grain on the spot, so the old men had nothing to say. After a period of publicity and explanation, there was no public opposition; but the conservative thinking was not completely resolved.

Implementing the new cultivation method, protecting seeds and seedlings is very important. At the beginning, the branch called on the farmers to disinfect and mix seeds with fertilizer, but no one moved. In order to promote everyone, I put my various fertilizers on the roof, sifting and mixing while publicizing the benefits of disinfecting and mixing seeds, and the advanced farmers began to move. Then we called on Party members, Youth League members, and cadres to take the lead, promoting the whole village to soak all sorghum seeds in warm water, float all millet seeds in salt water, and mix yellow soybeans with rhizobium.

Obstacles and difficulties came one after another.

Spring plowing began, and the farmers all said that there was no way to sow widely. We held an enlarged meeting of cadres to study how to widen the seedling holes (sowing width). At the meeting, it was discovered that Yu Dejiang had tied wooden planks to the mouths of his gourd dippers when planting wheat in the past, which made the seedling holes wide. After further research by agricultural technician Shi Fengming, a gourd dipper was made that was large at one end and small at the other, like a dustpan, and it worked well after a trial. Another mass appraisal experiment was held with Party members, cadres, Youth League, women's federation cadres, propagandists and technicians, and everyone suggested that the two sides of the gourd dipper mouth were too low and the seeds were jumping out. After improvement, the test was even better. The method of widening the seedling holes was available, and after it was introduced and tested on the spot at the mass meeting, eighteen new gourd dippers were made in all twenty-three groups in the village, even the most conservative Liu Jingfang made one. Under the leadership of Lan Jingfang (deputy village chief) and our group, the masses also implemented wide sowing. Everyone understood the benefits of wide sowing and were concerned about how to sow better.

The most obstacles were encountered when mobilizing for thinning seedlings. In addition to strengthening the leadership of Party members and Youth League members, the branch also used a lot of effort to lead the work of women, propagandists, and the technical research committee. Thinning seedlings required a large amount of manpower, so the main problem in women's work was how to mobilize women with children. For this reason, I held a meeting of old ladies to mobilize them to take care of children, so that all one hundred and sixty-one able-bodied women in the village participated in production. I also often encouraged women activists such as Kong Fanqin and Xiao Changzhi to help them solve various problems and launch a red flag competition. Women thinned seedlings on 388 hectares, accounting for 67% of the total cultivated area. They played a decisive role in thinning the seedlings.

The village had thirty-two propagandists (most of whom were Party members and Youth League members), who contracted for publicity on a piece-by-piece basis, led by the propaganda committee member, reporting every seven days, and any problems were brought to the branch committee meeting for research and resolution, and a publicity competition was launched. The standard for good propaganda work was: to solve ideological problems and get the masses to take action. The propagandists all publicized while taking the lead, which played a big role in improving technology for summer hoeing.

The technical research committee has technical research groups with twenty-eight technicians, which were even more active during seedling thinning, conducting technical research at any time, sometimes inviting old farmers to make reports on production experience, which were researched and implemented among the masses. It was difficult to get through the old men's thinking, and there was a lot of resistance to implementing new technologies, so the technical research group absorbed five old men to participate, listened to their opinions humbly, and then combined the new technologies with their experience. When the old men's thinking was straightened out, their promotion role was great, which also removed the obstacles for Party members and Youth League members who could not afford to start a business to move forward, and the role of technical research became more active. Everyone held meetings in the fields, making, researching and learning at the same time. We also organized seedling transplanting visits and on-site discussions, all of which had good results.

This year, our village implemented the new cultivation methods proposed by the county party committee more conscientiously. Although it was dry for more than fifty days, the yield was still more than one and a half times higher than in 1950, the year with the highest grain yield.

The work style of our village cadres has changed, and the relationship with the masses has become better. Liu Mingchen said: "I would rather leave out anything else but not leave out a meeting, leaving out a meeting means missing out on experience." Many people reflected: "If you don't attend the meeting, you feel like your ears are deaf." The ideological awareness of the farmers has been greatly improved, it is easier to convene meetings, and the masses respect the leadership of the cadres.

In the process of leading the farmers to implement the new cultivation methods proposed by the county party committee this year, I deeply felt that leading agricultural production is not simple, and it is impossible not to study for a while. It was incorrect to think in the past that the masses were not easy to lead. The masses trust our leadership, the problem lies in that we must know how to lead, continuously improve our leadership ability, and meet the increasingly higher demands of the masses. Although our village has made some achievements in the past year, it is still far from the needs of the work. For example, sometimes the main problems are not grasped, the conservative thinking still exists among the farmers, and the new cultivation methods of "equal distance wide sowing, seedling thinning to protect seedlings, and applying fertilizer in stages" have not yet reached the standard. It is necessary to strengthen learning and improve ourselves so that we can effectively solve these problems and lead the masses of the whole village to work hard for more grain and for the realization of agricultural collectivization in the future.

    一时不学习就落后了
    中共肇源县孟克里村支部书记　孙景云
    我从一九四九年当选本村的党支部书记。自己是赶车、打头出身，认为领导农业生产很简单，没啥，也就不大学习政策和农业技术。因为不学习，自己不能提高，做工作不会发挥大家的力量；党支委没有分工，作啥都是一把抓，遇事大家互相推，不负责任。我一天忙得脚不沾地，哪个小组出了问题就往哪里跑。自己对农村经济发展方向也不明确，工作不深入。农民创造出来的好经验，也不能发现。召开群众会我也没啥新东西向群众讲的，只好说：“快拉快打吧，要三光四净……”大家都不愿意听，散会就反映：“还不是那一套哇！”有的人根本就不参加，如陶青春说：“不去啦，反正是生产，谁还不知道！”刘明臣一到会场就睡觉。他说：
    “我啥都会，用不着听。”
    今年区委号召实行“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的新耕作法，我有了领导老乡改进农业技术多打粮食的办法，下定决心在本村推广。从这时起我开始学会用脑子了。
    备耕时，我就怀着满腔热情召开支委会讨论这事。可是许多人的思想搞不通，有的说：“亘古以来也没听说过。”有的说：“根本就作不到。”后来区委书记王焕章同志来了，他用算细账的办法，彻底批判了保守思想，提高了支委的认识，决定在群众中贯彻。开始没有经验，张桂芳小组进行试验失败了，全村农民议论纷纷。老头们更反对，到一起就谈论这件事，有的说：“这才扯蛋呢！”有的说：“干部没活干了，呆着干啥，闲磨牙呗！”
    这时我感到，要完成这一任务光靠自己是不行的，必需发挥大家的力量。支委分了工：由李振久
    （村长）负责行政和团的工作，萧品堂（女）负责妇女工作，唐万芳负责宣传网工作，别的支委也都分了工。我除了全面负责以外，还亲自掌握技术研究委员会的工作。另外支委分片加强对互助组的领导，七天互相检查一次，发现问题，在支委会上研究解决。支部通过各种组织，了解了群众思想和生产中的问题，工作主动了。这样支部就成了坚强的领导核心，各个组织都紧紧地团结在支部的周围，形成了强大的组织力量。支部又确定以傅宝山、王墨林两个小组为重点组，通过组里的积极分子（都是党员、团员、宣传员或技术员），带领大家作出样子，再推动全村。
    支部掌握了大批党员、团员、宣传员、技术员和重点组以后，就组织这批力量向保守思想展开了斗争。用查槎子、量穗头和总结过去多打粮的经验等办法，贯彻“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的新技术。老头们的保守思想不好打通，我就亲自召开老头会，向他们讲，当场又拿谷穗量，老头们没话可说了。经过一个时期的宣传解释，总算没有公开反对的了；但保守思想并没彻底解决。
    实行新耕作法，保种保苗很重要。开始支部号召农民种籽消毒、拌种肥，谁也不动。为了推动大家，我就把自己的各种肥料拿到房顶上，一面连筛带拌，一面向群众宣传消毒拌种的好处，先进的农民跟着动起来。再号召党员、团员和干部带头，推动全村高粱全部温汤浸种，谷子全部盐水漂种和王铜拌种，黄豆拌了根瘤菌。
    阻碍和困难接二连三地来了。
    春耕开始了，农民都说没办法宽播。我们就召开了干部扩大会议，研究怎样才能使苗眼（播幅）加宽。会上发现了于得江过去种麦子把点葫芦嘴绑上木?板，点的苗眼宽。又经农业科技术员石凤鸣同志研究，做了一个一头大一头小，像个簸箕似的点葫芦，一试验还行。又召开了党员、干部、青年团、妇联干部、宣传员和技术员会议进行群众性的鉴定试验，大家提出点葫芦嘴两帮低，往外蹦种。改进后，再一试验就更好使了。播宽苗眼的办法有了，在群众大会上介绍和当场试验后，全村二十三个小组，做了十八个新点葫芦，连最保守的刘景芳也做了。在蓝景芳（副村长）和我们小组带头下，群众也都实行了宽播。大家懂得了宽播的好处，就关心怎么播得更好。
    动员间苗遇到阻碍最多。支部除了加强对党员、团员的领导，又用很大力量领导了妇女、宣传员、技术研究委员会的工作。间苗需要很大一批人力，所以在妇女工作中的主要问题是如何把有小孩的妇女发动起来。为此我就召开了老太太会，动员老太太给带孩子，使全村一百六十一名能劳动的妇女，全部参加了生产。我又经常鼓励孔范琴、萧昌芝等妇女积极分子，帮助她们解决各种问题，展开红旗竞赛。妇女共间苗三百八十八垧，占总耕地面积百分之六十七。她们在间苗中起了决定性的作用。
    全村有三十二名宣传员（党员、团员大部是宣传员）分片包干宣传，由宣传委员领导，七天一汇报，有啥难题就提到支委会上研究解决，并展开宣传竞赛。提出宣传工作好的标准是：解决思想问题，使群众行动起来。宣传员都一面宣传，一面带头干，对夏锄改进技术起了很大作用。
    技术研究委员会下有技术研究小组，有二十八名技术员，在间苗时就更活跃了，随时进行技术研究，有时请老农作生产经验报告，经过研究贯彻到群众中去。老头思想搞不通，贯彻新技术就有很大阻碍，所以技术研究组吸收了五个老头参加，虚心听取他们的意见，再把新技术和他们的经验结合起来。老头的思想搞通了，他们的推动作用很大，也就去掉了当不起家的党员、团员活动的阻碍，技术研究的作用就更活跃了。大家在地里开会，一边作，一边研究和学习，也组织过移苗参观，就地座谈，效果都很好。
    今年我们村比较认真地贯彻了县委提出的新耕作法，虽然旱了五十多天，产量也还比打粮最多的一九五○年高出一倍半还多。
    我们村干部工作作风转变了，和群众的关系就好了起来。刘明臣说：“认可拉下别的也不能拉下一个会，拉下一个会就少得经验。”很多群众都反映：“要不参加会，就感到耳朵发聋。”农民的思想觉悟大大提高了，开会好召集了，群众很尊重干部的领导。
    今年在领导农民贯彻县委提出新耕作法的过程中，我深深感到，领导农业生产并不简单，一时不学习就不行了。过去认为群众不好领导是不正确的。群众是信服我们领导的，问题在于我们得会领导，不断提高领导能力，满足群众越来越高的要求。我们村一年来的工作虽然有了一定的成绩，但是距离工作的需要还很远。比如工作有时还抓不住主要问题，农民中保守思想仍旧存在，“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的新耕作法做的还没达到标准。需要加强学习，提高自己，好切实解决这些问题，领导全村群众为更多地打粮食，为将来实现农业集体化而努力。　（景章记）
