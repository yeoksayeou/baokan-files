All Overseas Chinese in Rajin County, North Hamgyong Province, Korea
Thank the Motherland's People for Their Warm Care and Strong Support

    Dear Chairman Mao: We, all the overseas Chinese living in Rajin County in the northeast corner of Korea, extend our highest respect to you and thank you and the Chinese people for your great concern for the Korean people and us.
    Many years ago, we left our motherland and crossed the Yalu and Tumen Rivers. But we have not forgotten our motherland, and we are thinking of our motherland all the time. Before the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, at the end of a heavy day's work, the farmers stood up their hoes, the dockworkers put down their heavy bags... Everyone straightened their backs, sighed, and looked up at the motherland. Unfortunately, at that time, the motherland was a dismal land under a cloudy sky, with no smoke from the stoves and no sound of people - at that time, the motherland, like Korea, was suffering from imperialist aggression and ravage. When will the motherland be able to stand up? We thought and hoped for it every day.
    The day of victory finally arrived. On October 1, 1949, the first five-star red flag fluttered over Beijing, and Chairman Mao's portrait was hung on Tiananmen Square. The people of the whole country celebrated the rebirth of the motherland in the streets and alleys, waving red flags and beating drums. Standing on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Tumen River, we listened to the joyous songs coming from the motherland across the water.
    The people of the motherland have stood up; under the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we are also living a happy life. We are working hard with the Korean people to build Korea as beautiful as the motherland.
    On June 25, 1950, the Li Seung-man gang, under the instigation and with the assistance of US imperialism, began a frenzied war of aggression. The planes of the American aggressor troops inhumanely and indiscriminately bombed. Many Korean people and overseas Chinese lost their homes and their loved ones. The crops we had worked hard for a year were all destroyed in the fields. However, we are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle against US imperialism and the Li Seung-man gang. We firmly believe that victory will belong to us. The great support of the people of the motherland strengthens our confidence and that of the Korean people. Two years ago, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, shouldering the entrustment of the people of the motherland, crossed the river to support the Korean people's struggle. For the past two years, the people of China and Korea have fought side by side, severely打击 (dǎ jī - a term with strong implications of assault and defeat. Could be translated as severely struck or severely battered) the US aggressor troops and achieved glorious victories. We walked out of the valleys and picked up our farm tools again, cultivating our fields more vigorously to support our defenders - the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    This year is a year of good harvest. When we watch our children carry their schoolbags to school, and when we watch the harvested crops being carted home one after another, we sincerely thank Chairman Mao, thank all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army comrades, and thank the great people of the motherland!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Long live the great people of the motherland!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    All Overseas Chinese in Rajin County, North Hamgyong Province, Korea

    朝鲜咸镜北道罗津郡全体华侨
    感谢祖国人民的热情关怀和有力支援
    亲爱的毛主席：让我们生活在朝鲜东北角罗津郡的全体华侨向您致崇高的敬意，并感谢您和中国人民对朝鲜人民和我们的伟大关怀。
    在很多年以前，我们离开了祖国，渡过了鸭绿江和图们江。可是我们并没有忘掉祖国，我们时时刻刻都在想念着祖国。在祖国人民革命大胜利以前，在一天沉重的工作结束时，农民立起了锄头，码头工人们放下了沉重的载袋，……大家直起腰来，长吁了一口气，抬头先看看祖国。可惜那时的祖国是雾云下阴惨惨的一片大地，看不到灶烟，也听不到人声——那时，祖国和朝鲜一样，正受着帝国主义的侵略和蹂躏。祖国何时才能站立起来呢？我们天天都这样想，这样盼。
    胜利的一天终于到来啦。一九四九年十月一日，北京的上空飘起了第一面五星红旗，毛主席的肖像挂在天安门上了。全国人民打着红旗，敲着锣鼓在大街小巷欢庆着祖国的新生。站在图们江下游南岸的我们，隔着水波，听着从祖国传来的欢愉歌声。
    祖国人民站起来了；我们在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领导下，也同样过着幸福的生活。我们和朝鲜人民在一起紧张地进行着建设，要把朝鲜建设得和祖国一样的美好。
    一九五○年六月二十五日，李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义的指使和援助下，开始了疯狂的侵略战争。美国侵略军的飞机惨无人道地滥肆轰炸。许多朝鲜人民及华侨失去了家园，失去了亲人。我们辛勤劳动一年的庄稼都毁在地里了。但是，我们同美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮进行着英勇不屈的斗争，我们深信，胜利必将属于我们。祖国人民的伟大支援更加强我们和朝鲜人民的信心。两年前，英雄的中国人民志愿军勇士，负起祖国人民的嘱托，渡江支援朝鲜人民的斗争。两年来，中朝两国人民并肩作战，狠狠地打击了美国侵略军，取得了光辉的胜利。我们走出了山谷，重新拿起农具，更用力地耕种我们的田地，来支援我们的保卫者——朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。
    今年是丰收年。当我们看着孩子们背起书包上学时，看着收下来的庄稼一车车拉进家门时，我们都衷心感谢毛主席，感谢志愿军全体指战员同志们，感谢伟大的祖国人民！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    伟大的祖国人民万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朝鲜咸镜北道罗津郡全体华侨
