(Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 21st) The World People's Peace Congress concluded its closing session on the evening of the 19th, according to a TASS report from Vienna on December 21st. This great gathering of people from all nations concluded its eight days of work at this session.

    The hall of the Vienna Music Hall was more crowded than at any time these past few days. The main hall, the balcony, and the upper tiers were filled with delegates, observers, guests, and journalists; even the corridors, aisles, and doorways were packed; several hundred guests listened to the speeches via radio in rooms adjacent to the venue. The hall was illuminated by arc lights as bright as day. The atmosphere in the hall was extremely lively and enthusiastic; delegates and guests sang joyous songs in various languages, echoing throughout the hall. In the hall, one could see delegates embracing each other; they were now people bound by firm friendship, bidding farewell before returning home, carrying the lofty message of the World People's Peace Congress to their homelands.

    The closing session was chaired by Yves Farge, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and a renowned French peace activist. He was greeted by a storm of applause from the delegates.

    Jean Lafitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, reported on the composition of the World People's Peace Congress and the organizational work completed. Lafitte said: The World Peace Council convened the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna from December 12th to 19th, 1952. 1,857 people from 85 countries participated in the Congress, including 1,604 delegates, 105 guests, 102 observers, and 46 representatives from national groups and international organizations.

    The Soviet Union sent 44 delegates to the Congress, and the People's Democratic countries sent six delegations, totaling 138 people. Other European countries sent delegations totaling 1,019 people. Despite various obstacles, 198 Italian delegates attended the Congress.

    China sent 59 delegates, Korea sent 19 delegates, and Vietnam sent 11 delegates. Other Asian countries sent 18 delegations, totaling 150 people, including 30 from India and 17 from Japan.

    The Americas were represented by 23 delegations, totaling 293 people.

    Africa and Oceania sent 10 delegations, totaling 96 people.

    Both delegates who had participated in the World Peace Movement and those who had not attended the Congress.

    178 journalists from 30 countries, representing 113 newspapers and 18 news agencies, attended the Congress sessions.

    Chairman Yves Farge announced that the Congress had received over 2,000 congratulatory telegrams from residents of cities and villages, as well as from enterprises, groups, and prominent figures in various countries. These telegrams expressed strong support for the Congress's proposals and the desire to defend world peace.

    Next, Posari reported on the work of the Committee on National Independence and International Security; Wen Youzhang reported on the work of the Committee on Ending Current Wars; and Isabella Blum reported on the work of the Committee on Easing International Tensions. The recommendations put forward by the three committees in their reports formed the basis of the Congress's resolutions.

    The Congress then proceeded with the most important part of its work—discussing and passing resolutions that would surely help awaken millions of people around the world to participate in the struggle against the threat of a third world war and for lasting peace.

    Professor Bernal of Britain rose to speak, reading the full text of the World People's Peace Congress's letter to the governments of the five great powers.

    In this document, the World People's Peace Congress solemnly appealed to the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France to begin negotiations on the conclusion of a peace pact, in order to save the world from catastrophe.

    Bernal said that a committee had been formed to deliver this document to the governments of the five great powers. This committee was composed of representatives from different countries, including Soviet writers Ilya Ehrenburg and Nikolai Tikhonov. As Bernal concluded his speech, the hall erupted in thunderous applause and cheers.

    Next, Hélène de Chambes read the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress, which stated: The people of all countries unanimously strive for the immediate end to the current wars in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya; strive for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers; and strive to end the phenomenon of one country interfering in the internal affairs of another. The declaration put forward concrete methods for the peaceful resolution of the German and Japanese questions, and demanded the prohibition of all types of weapons of mass destruction. In the final part of the declaration, the Congress called on the people of all countries to fight for consultation and agreement, and for humanity's right to peace. As de Chambes read the full text of the declaration, he was repeatedly interrupted by storms of applause.

    After these two documents were read, each delegation voted on them separately. The various delegations gathered in the corners of the conference hall, in the rooms next to the hall, and on the balconies to meet. Every delegate had the opportunity to express their opinion. Applause and cheers erupted from here or there, indicating that a delegation's vote had ended.

    Yves Farge announced the voting results in a joyous atmosphere. 1,637 delegates voted in favor of the letter to the governments of the five great powers; seven delegates abstained.

    1,626 delegates voted in favor of the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress; ten delegates abstained.

    The unanimous voting results of the participating delegates sparked another round of thunderous cheers. The entire hall stood up, chanting "Long live peace!" in various languages. Attendees stood and applauded and cheered for fifteen minutes, expressing their support for the Congress's resolutions. Tears of joy glistened in the eyes of many delegates. Hundreds of colorful headscarves were thrown into the air, delegates shook hands with each other, and thousands of people began to sing the World Democratic Youth Anthem.

    Finally, when the cheers subsided, Italian delegate Giuseppe Nitti took to the podium to deliver the closing speech. He pointed out that the participants in the Congress included representatives of various races and countries, with various religious beliefs, ideas, and belonging to different political parties. All delegates had the opportunity to speak at the plenary session or in the committee meetings, and they had full freedom to express their opinions. They expressed their opinions and views and put forward critical comments.

    Nitti pointed out that the delegates listened to the speeches of representatives of churches from various countries and representatives of colonial countries that were suffering from brutal colonial oppression. He said that some important speeches were delivered on the platform of the World People's Peace Congress. These speeches would become extremely valuable documents, and therefore, a white paper should be published that collected all of these speeches.

    Nitti continued, we have done a lot of work, and we can say that the results obtained are satisfactory... In order to win victory, one must have faith in an ideal, and one must bravely and selflessly defend our cause.

    Nitti said, most of us, when we return to our countries, will encounter many difficulties. We may encounter dangers. So, my dear friends, let us bravely face this danger, because we know that we are defending a just cause. You have passed the Declaration of the World People's Peace Congress, and we will present this simple and effective proposal to the leaders of the five great powers. We will ask them to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a peace pact. The people will unite around it, and this unity will be the greatest unity in human history. We—old warriors and new friends today—will work together to achieve this goal and drive away the specter of war. We believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence of different systems. We believe that all differences between countries can be resolved through consultation. We firmly believe that peace can be saved, and we will bravely and resolutely fight for our cause.

    After Nitti finished his speech, Yves Farge announced: The World People's Peace Congress victoriously closed at 3 a.m. on December 20th.

    世界人民和平大会闭幕
    通过致五大国政府书和大会宣言
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十一日讯：世界人民和平大会于十九日晚间举行闭幕会议。各国人民的伟大集会在这次会议上结束了它八天的工作。
    维也纳音乐厅的大厅这次比这些天来的任何一次都拥挤。正厅、楼厅和顶层楼座都坐满了代表、列席代表、来宾和新闻记者；甚至走廊上、过道上和门口也站满了人；好几百来宾在邻近会场的房间内用收音机收听演说。大厅被弧光灯照耀得如同白昼。大厅里的气氛极为生动与热烈；代表们和来宾们用各种不同的语言唱着愉快的歌，歌声响遍了厅堂。在大厅里，人们可以看到代表们在彼此拥抱；他们现在是由牢固的友谊所联系着的人们，他们在动身回家之前互相道别，他们将把世界人民和平大会的崇高信息带回家乡。
    闭幕会议由世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、著名的法国和平战士伊夫·法奇担任主席。他受到代表们暴风雨般掌声的欢迎。
    世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德就世界人民和平大会的组成和已完成的组织工作作了报告。拉斐德说：世界和平理事会于一九五二年十二月十二日到十九日在维也纳召开世界人民和平大会，有八十五个国家的一千八百五十七人参加了大会，其中有一千六百零四位代表、一百零五位来宾、一百零二位列席代表以及各国团体和国际组织的四十六位代表。

    参加大会会议的有一百七十八个新闻记者，他们来自三十个国家，代表一百一十三种报纸和十八个通讯社。
    会议主席伊夫·法奇宣布，大会接到了城市和乡村居民以及各国的企业、团体和社会名流发来的二千多份贺电。这些贺电都表示热烈支持大会的主张和保卫世界和平的愿望。
    接着，波萨里就民族独立与国际安全问题委员会的工作作了报告；文幼章就结束现行战争问题委员会的工作作了报告；伊沙贝拉·布伦姆就缓和国际紧张形势问题委员会的工作作了报告。三个委员会在报告中提出的建议构成了大会决议的基础。
    大会接着进行它的工作中最重要的一部分——讨论并通过决议，这些决议一定可以有助于唤起世界各地千百万人民参加反对第三次世界大战威胁、争取持久和平的斗争。
    英国的贝尔纳教授起立发言，他宣读了世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书的全文。
    世界人民和平大会在这个文件中郑重地吁请美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国五国政府就缔结和平公约一事开始举行谈判，以拯救世界免于浩劫。
    贝尔纳说，已经成立一个委员会把这个文件送交五大国政府。这个委员会由不同国家的代表组成，其中包括苏联作家爱伦堡和吉洪诺夫。在贝尔纳结束发言时，会场上响起了雷动的掌声和欢呼声。
    接着，希伯尔·德香布兰宣读了世界人民和平大会的宣言，宣言表示：各国人民一致争取立即结束朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚的现行战争，争取缔结五大国和平公约，争取结束一国干涉他国内政的现象。宣言提出了和平解决德国和日本问题的具体方法，并要求禁用各种类型的大规模毁灭武器。在宣言的最后一部分，大会要求世界各国人民为协商和协议，为人类对和平的权利进行斗争。在德香布兰宣读宣言的全文时，他一再为暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    在这两篇文件宣读完毕后，每个代表团对它们分别进行表决。各个代表团聚集在会议大厅的各个角落，聚集在大厅旁边的房间里，聚集在楼厅上开会。每一位代表都有机会发表自己的意见。掌声和欢呼声从这里或那里发出，表示某一代表团的表决已经结束。
    伊夫·法奇在欢乐的气氛中宣布了表决结果。一千六百三十七位代表投票赞成致五大国政府书；七位代表弃权。
    一千六百二十六位代表投票赞成世界人民和平大会的宣言；十位代表弃权。
    与会代表们的一致投票结果又引起一阵雷动的欢呼声。全场起立，用各种语言欢呼“和平万岁！”与会者站着鼓掌欢呼达十五分钟之久，表示他们对于大会决议的拥护。许多代表的眼中闪耀着快乐的眼泪。成百的彩色头巾被抛到空中，代表们彼此握手，成千的人们开始高唱世界民主青年进行曲。
    最后，当欢呼声停止时，意大利代表裘塞佩·尼蒂到讲台上致闭幕词。他指出，参加大会的有各个种族和各个国家的代表，他们有各种不同的宗教信仰、思想，并属于不同的政党。所有代表有机会在全体大会上或在各委员会的会议上发言，他们有充分自由发表他们的意见。他们发表了他们的意见和看法并提出了批评的意见。
    尼蒂指出，代表们听取了各国教会代表和正在遭受残酷的殖民压迫的殖民地国家的代表的发言。他说，世界人民和平大会的讲台上发出了一些重要的演说。这些演说将成为极有价值的文件，因此，应该出版一本把所有这些演说都收集在内的白皮书。
    尼蒂接着说，我们已经做了很多工作，我们可以说，所获得的结果是令人满意的……为了赢得胜利，就必须对一个理想怀有信念，就必须勇敢而忘我地保卫我们的事业。
    尼蒂说，我们大部分的人回到国内，将会遇到许多困难。我们也许会遇到危险。那么，我亲爱的朋友们，让我们勇敢地面对这种危险，因为我们知道我们保卫的是一个正义的事业。你们已通过了世界人民和平大会的宣言，我们将向五大国的领袖们提出这个既简单又有效的提议。我们将要求它们进行关于缔结和平公约的谈判，人民将围绕着它团结起来，这种团结将是人类历史上最伟大的团结。我们——老战士和今天的新朋友——将一道工作来达到这个目的，驱走战争的幽灵。我们相信不同制度和平共存的可能。我们相信各国间的一切分歧可以经由协商方式来解决。我们深信和平能够拯救，我们将勇敢而坚决地为我们的事业进行斗争。
    尼蒂演说结束后，伊夫·法奇宣布：世界人民和平大会在十二月二十日晨三时胜利闭幕。
