    A Child Born Under the Care of the Party and the People's Government
    Comrade Editor: Every time I finish my day's work and come home to take care of my child, who was born just over two months ago, I am filled with excitement. He is my fourth child, a fortunate child, a child born under the care of the Party and the People's Government. Thinking of this, I sometimes can't help but shed tears of excitement.
    When I first realized that I was pregnant for the fourth time, I also shed tears—but those were tears of sorrow. I recalled the situation when I gave birth to my second child. It was before liberation, and I was teaching in a private primary school in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province. At that time, the salary of a primary school teacher was pitifully low. I didn't even have money to buy brown sugar during my confinement period. Due to the lack of necessary nourishment, my health was ruined. When my twenty-day maternity leave expired, I was still too weak to work, and as a result, I was dismissed by the school. I lost my job. It was not until liberation that I had the opportunity to become a primary school teacher again; but soon after taking the job, I gave birth to my third child. Three children were already enough of a burden and responsibility for me; and now, I was pregnant with my fourth. From pregnancy to delivery, I was constantly worried: How would I manage the expenses during the confinement period? Who would take care of the child after it was born? How could I continue to teach with four children to care for? If I didn't teach, living would be a small matter, but I really couldn't bear to leave this group of adorable children at school!
    On the morning of September 11th, I gave birth to the child with a worried frown. I looked at the newborn and felt very sad. I loved this child, but I also loved my work! Just when I was in a dilemma, the savior came. The former Subei Administrative Office of Culture and Education and the former Subei Regional Federation of Trade Unions sent letters one after another. The letters said, "Having many children is the glory of a mother!" They gave me two months of maternity leave, with my salary paid as usual, so that I could rest well. The letters also enclosed 150,000 yuan to subsidize my confinement expenses. The county Federation of Trade Unions, concerned that having many children would affect my work, decided to subsidize me 50,000 yuan per month for a nanny for the newborn child. With this, my worries were immediately dispelled. At that time, my emotions were boiling like hot water: the motherland's care for me and the newborn child was truly meticulous! If it weren't for the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, such a thing would never have happened!
    Because I lived comfortably, was in good spirits, and had plenty of rest during the confinement period, and also because of the many concerns of my comrades, I was much healthier after my leave than before giving birth. My child is also growing up white and fat, lively and lovely.
    Now I am happily back at work at the school. When I look at the innocent and lively children around me at school, and look at the white and fat, lovely newborn infant at home, I feel happiness filling my heart. I sincerely thank the Party and the People's Government for their concern for me and my child, and I am determined to dedicate my life's energy to the younger generation of the motherland, so that they can become builders of a happier and more beautiful future for the motherland.

    在党和人民政府关怀下诞生的孩子
    编辑同志：每当我做完一天的工作，回家照料着我诞生才二个多月的孩子时，热情就激动着我。他是我第四个孩子，幸福的孩子，在党和人民政府关怀下诞生的孩子。想到这，我有时禁不住兴奋得流下热泪来。
    在我开始发觉我已第四次怀孕时，我也曾流过泪——但那时流的是愁苦的眼泪。我回忆起生第二个孩子时的情况，那是在解放以前，当时我在江苏沭阳县一个私立小学教书。那时小学教员的薪水低得可怜，在产期里连买些红糖都没有钱。因为缺乏必要的补养，我的身体就这样搞坏了。当二十天产假期满后，我虚弱得仍旧不能工作，结果就被学校解聘了。我也就失了业。好容易熬到了解放，我才能有机会当了小学教员；但到职不久，我又生下了第三个孩子。三个孩子，就已经够我负担和照料的了；而现在，我又怀了第四个孩子。从怀孕到分娩，我一直就愁苦着：产期中的费用怎么办呢？孩子生下后谁来照料呢？自己要照料四个孩子怎么再能教书呢？不教书吧，生活是小事，我实在舍不得离开学校里这一群可爱的小朋友呀！
    九月十一日早晨，我愁眉苦脸地把孩子生下来。我看了看新生的孩子，心里感到很难过。我爱这孩子，但我也爱工作！正当我左右为难时，救星来了。前苏北行署文教处及前苏北区总工会相继来了信。信里说：“孩子多是母亲的光荣！”并给我两个月的产假，薪金照发，让我好好休养。随信又附来了十五万元钱，补助我产期费用。县总工会也因我孩子多，怕影响工作，决定今后按月补贴新生孩子褓姆费五万元。这样一来，我的愁帽子一下揭掉了。当时我的感情像开水一样沸腾着：祖国对我，对新生的孩子的关怀真是无微不至！要不是毛主席和共产党的英明领导，怎么也不会有这样的事情！
    因为产期中生活安适，精神愉快，休息的时间充分，更因有同志们的多方关切，我在假满后比生产前身体健康得多了。我的孩子也长得又白又胖，活泼可爱。
    现在我又愉快地到学校工作了。我在学校里看看周围的天真活泼的小朋友，回家后看看白胖可爱的新生的婴儿，我感到幸福充满着我的胸怀。我衷心感谢党和人民政府对我及孩子的关切，并且决心将我自己一生的精力献给祖国的后一代，使他们成为祖国更幸福美好的将来的建设者。
