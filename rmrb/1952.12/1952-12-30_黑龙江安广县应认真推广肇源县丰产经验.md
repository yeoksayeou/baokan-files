An'guang County in Heilongjiang Province and Zhaoyuan County are separated only by a river (An'guang County is on the left bank of the Nen River, and Zhaoyuan County is on the right bank); however, after the report on Zhaoyuan County's abundant harvest experience was published, the leaders of An'guang County only made general arrangements and calls at the Standing Committee of the County People's Representative Conference and the Representative Conference of the County People's Representative Conference and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and then considered the matter finished. The An'guang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not specifically study and discuss how to implement the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee's notice on promoting Zhaoyuan County's abundant harvest experience, did not formulate steps and methods for learning and promotion, and did not grasp the matter tightly; therefore, when it reached the districts, it was only treated as general "incidental work," and it was only mentioned at various meetings. Of the eight rural districts in the county, four districts simply "arranged" it at meetings on sideline occupations and public grain; two districts read the report on Zhaoyuan County's abundant harvest experience published in the Heilongjiang Daily, one district only read half of it, and one district simply did not study or arrange it. Xin Shouren, the propaganda officer of the Second District, had not even heard of Zhaoyuan County's abundant harvest experience. More than two-thirds of the thirteen village branches in the Seventh District did not study or publicize Zhaoyuan's abundant harvest experience. Yong'an Village in the Second District, because of its better work foundation and more active propaganda work, the villagers had at least heard about it; however, they did not know exactly what Zhaoyuan County's practices were. Xin Zhongcai, the deputy district head of the Second District, said: "Our district's leading cadres do not understand Zhaoyuan County's abundant harvest experience either. When I went to work in Yongle Village, the villagers asked, 'What is "equal-spaced wide sowing?"' At the time, I couldn't explain it. I was at a loss, but when I turned around, I saw a 'Heilongjiang Peasant Newspaper' pasted on the door, with an article explaining Zhaoyuan's abundant harvest experience. I hurriedly tore it down and read it to everyone. Only then did the villagers have a general understanding. This was also the first time I had studied this experience." The "High Yield Survey Team" organized by the county, with a total of ten people, visited eight districts in three days. They only investigated high yields, and neither seriously summarized the abundant harvest experience nor told the villagers about Zhaoyuan's experience. (Li Gui)

    黑龙江安广县应认真推广肇源县丰产经验
    黑龙江省安广县和肇源县只有一江之隔（安广县在嫩江左岸，肇源县在嫩江右岸）；可是报上发表了肇源县的丰产经验以后，安广县领导方面只在县人民代表会议常务委员会和县人民代表会议、中苏友好协会代表会议上，一般地布置和号召了一下，就算完事了。中共安广县委没有专门研究讨论如何贯彻黑龙江省委关于推广肇源县丰产经验的通知，没有订出学习和推广的步骤、方法，抓得又不紧；所以到了各区，就只当成了一般的“附带工作”，在各种会议上提一下就算了。全县八个农村区，有四个区在布置副业、公粮等会议上简单地“布置”了一下；有两个区念了一下黑龙江日报上发表的肇源县丰产经验，有一个区只念了一半，一个区干脆没学习也没有布置。二区的宣传干事信守仁，还没有听说过有肇源县的丰产经验。七区十三个村支部有三分之二以上没有学习和宣传肇源丰产经验。二区永安村因为工作基础较好，宣传工作比较活跃，老乡们还算是听讲过有这么一回事；可是却不知道肇源县的作法到底是怎样的。二区副区长辛忠财说：“我们区的领导干部，对于肇源县丰产经验也不懂得。我到永乐村工作，老乡们问‘等距宽播’是咋回事？当时我也讲不出来。我正蹩得没办法，一回头，看到门上贴着一张‘黑龙江农民报’，上面登着解释肇源丰产经验的文章，我就急忙扯下来给大家念了一遍。这样，老乡们才算了解一个大概的意思。这也是我头一次学习这个经验。”县里组织的
    “高额产量调查组”，共十个人，三天走了八个区。他们只调查了一下高额产量，既没有认真总结丰产经验，也没有向老乡们讲肇源的事。（李贵）
