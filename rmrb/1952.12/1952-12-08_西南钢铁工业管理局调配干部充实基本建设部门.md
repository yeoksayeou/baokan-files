Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration Transfers Cadres to Strengthen Basic Construction Departments

Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration Party Committee Member, Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration Deputy Director, Liu Bailuo

Editor's Note: The Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration's resolute approach of drawing cadres from production departments to strengthen basic construction work organizations is correct. Currently, this is indeed the primary method for resolving the cadre problem in basic construction.

In the past two months, the Party and administrative leadership of the Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration transferred 680 cadres and staff from production departments to strengthen and expand basic construction work organizations. Among them, veteran cadres at the factory director level accounted for 55% of the original total, technical personnel and engineers accounted for 70% of the original total number of engineers, and newly transferred technical personnel of various types accounted for 62% of the original total in production departments. In addition, a number of fixed workers were concentrated, the majority of whom were skilled workers in riveting, welding, installation, and civil construction, accounting for 60% of the original skilled workers.

A year ago, leading cadres of the Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration, following the Central Committee's instructions, paid attention to establishing deputy positions and cultivating cadres. Most workshops in the iron and steel plants and mines in Southwest China promoted three or more sets of cadres to deputy positions. Some workshops cultivated four or five sets of deputy cadres, from foreman and shift operator all the way up to section chief. This practice of establishing deputy positions laid the foundation for transferring cadres to strengthen basic construction departments.

After the Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration received the Central Committee's instructions on expanding basic construction organizations at the end of August this year, it carried out a series of ideological preparation work under the direct leadership of the CPC Central Committee's Southwest Bureau. First, ideological mobilization was conducted within the Party. Yu Jiangzhen, Minister of the Organization Department of the Southwest Bureau, made a mobilization report at a meeting of Party cadres at the municipal committee level and bureau and department chiefs, conveying the Central Committee's instructions and clarifying the principle of "basic construction first." Subsequently, the municipal Party committee and Party committees of iron and steel enterprises successively convened meetings of factory directors and Party secretaries to discuss and study specific tasks, determine the proportion of cadres to be transferred, stipulate that factory and mine directors should propose lists of names, which would be reviewed before a formal transfer plan was made. Each factory was required to complete the work of transferring cadres in stages according to the plan.

In the process of transferring cadres, the leading cadres of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration paid attention to strengthening trade union work, mobilizing trade union cadres to actively participate in revising quotas, and launching rationalization proposals, to ensure the general improvement of labor productivity. At the same time, they went deep into the workshops to understand the potential strength and ideological situation of the personnel in the workshops. Each factory implemented a weekly reporting system to report the situation of cadre mobilization in a timely manner, so that the leadership could effectively understand the situation and supervise and inspect the work.

During this cadre transfer, the Party Committee of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration promptly resolved the following ideological problems:

First, the problem of "production will collapse if cadres are drawn out" was resolved through persuasion and education, and factual evidence. After the director of the blast furnace workshop of Factory 101 was transferred away, production not only did not collapse, but the new cadres and new acting leaders led the production with vigor. In less than a month, the equipment utilization rate increased by nearly 9% according to the plan, breaking the factory's historical record for highest daily output. The leaders of Factory 102 also initially said, "If technical personnel and skilled workers are transferred, our technical supervision system cannot be established." However, after research by the factory's Party Committee and the guidance of Soviet experts, a certain number of cadres were selected to establish a technical supervision organization and various technical supervision systems. At the same time, veteran cadres, technical cadres, and skilled workers were drawn out to establish the framework of the basic construction office. Not only did the product quality not decrease, but it improved significantly. In addition, some factory leaders had obvious departmentalism. When the higher authorities wanted to transfer cadres from their departments, they shouted, "Production will collapse, they cannot be transferred!" However, the higher authorities decided to transfer the person himself away from this production post, and the cry of "production will collapse" immediately disappeared.

Second, some unit leaders believed that "other workshops can transfer cadres, but key workshops cannot." In order to correct this mentality of emphasizing special cases, the leadership carefully learned about the workshop situation, and then put forward a list of names to be transferred. When the workshop situation was not yet fully understood, a trial transfer method was adopted, or the technical personnel of the workshop were given other work tasks. In Factory 101, the leadership initially assigned some engineering personnel to design work, gradually detaching them from workshop production, and then transferred them to the basic construction department. In fact, there were more activists in key workshops than in other workshops. After the engineers were transferred, the cadres below could continue to work.

Third, some leaders emphasized that there were too few people to transfer. For such units, two methods were adopted: First, after investigation and research, if it was proven that a factory did indeed have few technical personnel, and the factory's leader was unfamiliar with the cadres and production situation, a decision was made to cultivate cadres within a time limit. When the conditions were ripe and replacements were promoted, then the cadres were transferred. The other method was for units with simple production processes. Even if there were few cadres, the transfer of some technical personnel would not have any impact on production, so the transfer was resolutely carried out. For example, although Factory 104 had very few technical personnel, it still transferred fourteen technical staff members and above, leaving only a few technical personnel to lead production technology work. As a result, it continued to supply important steel new-style tie plates for railway construction as usual.

There was also a situation of "verbal agreement, but no action." Some leaders fully agreed to the transfer at the meeting, but when implementing the transfer task, they showed procrastination and could not complete the task. In addition to relying on strengthening criticism and self-criticism to seek correction, thorough inspections were carried out, the names on the finalized lists were checked in detail, and education was conducted at certain meetings.

In this cadre transfer, the problem of using specialized talents and returning technical personnel to their professional fields has not been fully resolved. Some responsible comrades in units retaining technical personnel are unwilling to transfer out so-called capable engineers. Therefore, even though these people are industrial university graduates or steelmaking engineers, they still remain in the office as secretaries or teach in ordinary middle schools. According to the experience of internal cadre adjustments in the Iron and Steel Industry Administration, as long as the thinking of the unit leaders is straightened out and a designated transfer method is adopted, the transferred personnel themselves are extremely willing to transfer, and the work of the original organs is not difficult to resolve. The key lies in the departmentalism of the responsible comrades in retaining cadres. Fuling Middle School in Sichuan still retains a rolling mill engineer as a teacher to this day, which is unreasonable.

At present, the work of mobilizing cadres has not yet ended. Although various incorrect ideas have been basically corrected, some ideological obstacles still exist more or less, intermittently, among some cadres. In order to further expand the basic construction organizations, the leadership of the Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration intends to take the following measures:

1. Overcome departmentalism, continue to add new deputy positions and cultivate and promote cadres who originally held deputy positions, preparing to once again transfer a large number of cadres from production departments to basic construction posts in the future.

2. Vigorously run secondary technical schools and attach technical worker schools to larger factories to open up a source of cadres.

3. Expand apprentices and trainees in relevant production workshops, and recruit a large number of primary school students of appropriate age as apprentices and students above junior high school level as trainees, to directly cultivate them in production, so that a large number of students have learning opportunities, supplementing the shortcomings of school education.

4. Continue to send personnel to advanced regions such as Northeast China to study.

5. Tap the potential capabilities of rural areas. According to investigations, some technical personnel or workers can still be collected from local areas in rural Southwest China. If the Party and government systems organize mobilization, this manpower can be used in the most important posts.

6. Expand engineering companies and strengthen civil construction engineering teams. In winter training, strengthen the education of promoting advanced experience, and organize mechanized research work to improve technical level and production efficiency, and pave the way for mechanization of basic construction. At the same time, strengthen their political education, improve their enthusiasm for building the motherland and their sense of responsibility as masters.

In order to complete the national construction tasks, the Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration is vigorously preparing to train new cadres and new workers, ready to listen to the country's mobilization at any time and invest in large-scale national construction.

    西南钢铁工业管理局调配干部充实基本建设部门
    西南钢铁工业管理局党委委员西南钢铁工业管理局副局长  刘柏罗
    编者按：西南钢铁工业管理局坚决从生产部门抽调干部充实基本建设的工作机构这种做法，是正确的。这在目前来说，确是解决基本建设干部问题的主要方法。
    西南钢铁工业管理局的党和行政领导方面在最近两个月内，从生产部门抽调了干部及工作人员六百八十人充实与扩大基本建设的工作机构。其中厂长级老干部占原有总数百分之五十五，技术人员、工程师占原有工程师总数百分之七十，新抽调的各种技术人员占生产部门原有总数百分之六十二。此外还集中固定工人若干人，其中大部分是铆焊、安装、土木建筑等技术工人，占原有技术工人百分之六十。
    一年以前，西南钢铁工业管理局领导干部根据中央指示，注意了设立副职，培养干部。西南各钢铁厂矿大部分车间提拔了三套以上的担任副职的干部，有些车间培养了四、五套副职干部，从工长，值班员一直到股长，都有副职。这种设立副职的作法，为抽调干部充实基本建设部门打下了基础。
    今年八月末，钢铁工业管理局接到了中央关于扩大基本建设机构的指示以后，在中共中央西南局的直接领导下，作了一系列的思想准备工作。首先，在党内进行了思想动员，由西南局组织部部长于江震同志在市委一级党的干部及局长、处长会议上作了动员报告，传达中央指示，明确了基本建设第一的方针；接着市委及钢铁企业党委先后召开了厂长、党委书记会议，讨论研究具体任务，确定抽调干部的比例数字，规定由各厂、矿长提出名单，经审查后作出正式的抽调计划，并要求各厂按照计划分期完成抽调干部的工作。
    在抽调干部的过程中，钢铁工业管理局的领导干部一方面注意加强工会工作，发动工会干部积极地参加了修订定额工作，开展合理化建议，保证了劳动生产率的普遍提高。同时，深入车间，了解车间人员的潜在力量和思想情况。各厂并实行周报制度，及时汇报调集干部的情况，以便领导方面切实地了解情况，督促检查。
    在此次抽调干部中，钢铁工业管理局党委会曾及时地解决了下列思想问题：
    第一，关于“抽出干部，生产要垮”的问题，经过了说服教育和事实证明就解决了。一○一厂高炉车间调走了车间主任，生产不但没有垮，而且新的干部新的代理人生气蓬勃地领导了生产，在不到一个月的时间，设备利用率按照计划增加了近百分之九，突破了该厂历史上最高日产量的纪录。一○二厂的领导人开始也说“抽调了技术人员、技术工人，我们的技术监督制度就无法建立了。”但是，经该厂党委会研究和苏联专家的指导，选拔了一定数量的干部，建立了技术监督组织和技术监督的各项制度。同时抽出了老干部、技术干部和技术工人，建立了基本建设处的架子。产品质量不仅没有降低，反而显著提高了。另外也有某些厂的负责人有着明显的本位主义思想，当上级要抽调他的部门的干部时，他大喊“生产要垮，不能抽调”，但是，上级决定把他本人调离这个生产岗位，“生产要垮”的叫唤也立即消失了。
    第二，有些单位的领导干部认为“其他车间可以调，重点车间不能调”。领导方面为了纠正这种强调特殊的思想，曾详细了解了车间情况，然后提出名单指定抽调。当车间情况还没有完全弄清楚时，则采用试调办法，或给予该车间技术人员其他工作任务。一○一厂第一场领导方面给一部分工程人员以设计工作，使他逐渐脱离车间生产，然后再调到基本建设部门。事实上重点车间的积极分子比其他车间还是较多的，调走了工程师，下面的干部完全可以继续工作下去。
    第三，有些领导干部强调人少不能调。对于这样的单位，采取两个办法：一是经过调查研究，证明某个工厂确实技术人员少，而厂的负责人又不熟悉干部及生产情况，则决定限期培养干部，等到条件成熟，提拔了代替人，然后再调。另一个是对于某些生产过程单纯的单位，即使干部少，但是抽出了一些技术人员，对生产不致有什么影响，则坚决抽调。如一○四厂虽然技术人员很少，却仍然调出了十四名技术员以上的人员，仅留个别技术人员领导生产技术工作，结果，照常供应了修筑铁路的重要钢材新式垫板。
    还有一种情况是“口调心不调”。有些领导干部在会议上满口答应抽调，但在执行抽调任务时，却表现推诿拖延，不能完成任务。这一情况，除依靠加强批评与自我批评求得纠正外，并采取深入检查，按照已定名单详细查点，在一定会议上再进行教育。
    在这次抽调干部中，对于专材专用，技术人员归队问题还没有完全解决。有些留有技术人员的单位负责同志不愿意把所谓得力的工程师调出来，因此尽管这些人是工业大学毕业生或是炼钢工程师，仍然留在机关里当秘书或是在普通中学里当教员。根据钢铁工业管理局内部调整干部的经验，只要打通单位负责人的思想，采取指名抽调的办法，那么被调人员自己是极愿意调动的，原机关工作也不难解决。关键就在于负责同志保留干部的本位主义思想。四川涪陵中学，至今还留一个轧钢工程师当教员，这是不合理的。
    目前调集干部的工作尚未结束，各种不正确的思想虽然基本上得到了纠正，但某种思想阻碍在某些干部中还或多或少、时隐时现的存在着。为了进一步扩大基本建设组织机构，西南钢铁工业管理局领导方面拟采取如下的措施：
    一、克服本位主义思想，继续增设新副职和培养提拔原来担任副职的干部，准备将来再度由生产部门输送大量干部到基本建设岗位上去；
    二、大力开办中等技术学校，并在较大的工厂内附设技工学校，开辟干部泉源；
    三、在各有关生产车间扩充艺徒及练习生，大量召集适当年龄的高小学生作艺徒，初中以上的学生作练习生，直接在生产中进行培养，使大批学生有学习机会，补助学校教育的不足；
    四、继续选派人员到东北等先进区域学习；
    五、挖掘农村潜在能力。根据调查：西南农村地方上还可能收集到一些技术人员或工人，如果经过党、政系统组织动员，可以把这些人力用到最重要的岗位上；
    六、扩大工程公司，壮大土木建筑工程队。在冬季训练中，加强推广先进经验的教育，及组织机械化研究工作，以提高技术水准及生产效率，为基本建设机械化开辟道路；同时加强他们的政治教育，提高他们对建设祖国的热情和主人翁的责任感。
    为了完成国家建设任务，西南钢铁工业管理局正大力准备培养新干部、新工人，随时听候祖国调动，投入大规模的国家建设中去。
