    "High yields produce heroes, and the autumn harvest brings many happy events." A moving story emerged in Beiwang Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province during the harvesting of mid-season rice: Li Jumei, the leader of the second administrative group in the township, was a woman with no agricultural production experience in the spring of this year; but after six months of effort, she became a thousand-jin yield achiever during the mid-season rice harvest.

    In the spring of this year, the county launched a thousand-jin yield movement, and Beiwang Township was the key township in the county. Li Jumei attended the township cadre meeting and understood the great significance of the high-yield movement. So, she bravely issued a challenge to others: to achieve a thousand-jin yield on all one mu and eight fen of land allocated to her during the land reform.

    The farmers in the township were stirred. Under the leadership of Li Jumei, many farmers also made thousand-jin yield plans; but in secret, it was like a pot boiling over, and many people were talking: "The 'tang ke' wants to be a thousand-jin household?" "Doing official business and going to people's schools is okay, but you can't get high yields with just your mouth!"

    The doubt was justified. Many people knew Li Jumei's background: Li Jumei's husband, Liu Bingyao, is a carpenter, and there is only one daughter under ten years old in the family. Before liberation, they had no tile to cover their heads or a needle to stick in the ground, relying entirely on Liu Bingyao's two hands to support three lives. Last year, they were allocated one mu and eight fen of land, which her husband cultivated in his spare time. This year, there was more carpentry work, and all the work in the fields fell on Li Jumei's shoulders. She not only didn't know where to start farming; but also, as the administrative group leader, attending meetings and doing official business took up a lot of time. Besides, high yields require a certain amount of capital, which her family also lacked. All in all, it was a "difficult" situation. Even her husband, after hearing the outside discussions, advised her not to talk big at first, lest she embarrass herself in the future.

    However, Li Jumei's determination was as firm as iron. She knew that women must participate in labor to achieve complete liberation, and she had also heard many stories of female labor models. She believed that as long as she listened to the words of the People's Government, humbly learned production experience, and persisted in her efforts, she would definitely succeed in achieving high yields. In half a year, she finally overcame various difficulties and created the achievement of a thousand-jin yield.

    From a woman who didn't understand production to a thousand-jin yield achiever, the road was not easy. When transplanting rice seedlings began, Li Jumei enthusiastically took off her shoes and went to the fields; but difficulties came her way: experienced farmers transplanted quickly and well, but she transplanted in a crooked line. It was not enough to rely on enthusiasm alone; she had to study hard - she immediately grabbed the seedlings and went to find a teacher. After Liu Jinsheng, a member of the Dai Jinlin mutual aid team, taught her the method of transplanting rice seedlings on the spot, she felt that she was transplanting much better, but she went to ask the old farmers for advice. Dai Jinlin checked the rice seedlings she transplanted and said happily: "Everything else is in order, except that the horizontal rows are too short." In this way, she gradually learned to transplant rice seedlings. When weeding, she couldn't even distinguish between barnyard grass and rice seedlings, so she asked the old farmers for advice. Watering, weeding, applying fertilizer..., she also learned. Now, except for plowing and harrowing, she can do all the work in the fields.

    When learning to farm, hands and feet are always slower than others; Li Jumei used perseverance to overcome this difficulty. When weeding the second time, the sun was like a ball of fire. While others were resting at noon, she was weeding under the hot sun, step by step, row by row; sweat dripped all over her face, but she didn't bother to wipe it off. When work ended in the evening, she had weeded no less land than others. One day, everyone was pulling weeds in the field when a sudden storm came. Everyone in the field ran home; she thought that if she didn't fill the water channels and open the outlets, the mountain floods would flood her seedlings. She stayed in the field and worked in the rain. After more than two hours, the rain stopped, and her hair was full of water, but her heart was warm. The other farmers smiled at her, she smiled at herself, went home to change her clothes, and went back to work in the field. During the fertilizer accumulation campaign, she followed the Dai Jinlin mutual aid team to the city every day to carry coal ash and garbage ash, several times a day, thus solving the difficulty of topdressing.

    "Listening to the words of the People's Government" is one of the important reasons for Li Jumei's high yield. Before sowing, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry called for the promotion of the improved variety "Wanli Xian." Many farmers said that "Wanli Xian" was unreliable and that beans could not be planted after planting it. But Li Jumei said: "What is the People's Government doing that is not for the good of the people!" She took the lead in using "Wanli Xian." At the autumn harvest, the "Wanli Xian" was the best among the township's more than ten kinds of rice seeds; and it did not affect the planting of beans. The People's Government introduced Li Chenggui's fertilizer application experience, and she learned to do it. Some farmers advised her that too much fertilizer would result in no harvest; but she firmly believed that "the experience promoted by the People's Government is correct." With enough fertilizer, the leaves of the rice seedlings were so dense that even a needle could not be inserted; her heart was also sweet. After the rice plants had flowered, a strong wind suddenly blew, and the rice seedlings in the entire field fell down. But the next day, when the sun came out, Li Jumei's rice seedlings stood up again, one after another. She stood by the field, smiling happily, and said: "The seeds promoted by the People's Government and the experience introduced will never be wrong!"

    Li Jumei succeeded in achieving high yields. The harvested rice, dried and cleaned, averaged one thousand and fifty-seven jin of dry rice per mu. This is one of the highest yields of mid-season rice in the township, more than double the yield of this field last year. On the day of the fertilizer application, the members of the Dai Jinlin mutual aid team gathered, and the work team inspected the scale.

    Beiwang Township was stirred, and everywhere people were talking about this event with envy. Dai Jinlin said: "Li Jumei went to the people's school last year and learned to write letters in one winter. This year, she engaged in high yields and became a thousand-jin household in half a year. She is truly a new person in the new society!" People who used to say cold words are now convinced. Many women have increased their confidence in participating in field production and are learning to work around her.

    However, Li Jumei still humbly said to everyone: "I haven't learned plowing and harrowing well, and I haven't joined the mutual aid team yet. This year, there are still three baskets of inferior rice in the field. I must continue to work hard!"

    千斤丰产的李菊梅
    “丰产出英雄，秋收喜事多”。湖南省衡山县北望乡在收割中稻时出现了一个动人的故事：该乡第二行政组长李菊梅，在今年春天还是一个毫无农业生产经验的妇女；但是经过半年的努力，她在收割中稻时成了千斤丰产者。
    今年春季，全县展开了千斤丰产运动，北望乡是全县的重点乡。李菊梅参加了乡干部会议，懂得了丰产运动的伟大意义。于是，她勇敢地向其他人提出了挑战条件：要把土地改革中分到的一亩八分田全部达到千斤丰产。
    全乡的农民轰动了。不少农民在李菊梅带动下也订出了千斤丰产计划；但是在暗地里，却像煮翻了一锅粥一样，很多人议论纷纷：“堂客也想搞千斤户？”“办公事、上民校还行，拿嘴巴搞丰产可不成！”
    怀疑是有根据的。许多人晓得李菊梅的老底：李菊梅的丈夫刘炳尧是个木匠，此外，家里只有一个不满十岁的女儿。解放前他家上无片瓦、下无插针之地，全靠刘炳尧一双手养活三条命。去年分了一亩八分田，由她丈夫抽空种着。今年，木匠活多了，田里的事全部落在李菊梅的肩上。她不但不知道作田从那里开门；并且当行政小组长，开会、办公事还要占很多时间。再说，丰产要一定的资本，她家也不够条件。算来算去，那里也是个“难”字。就是她丈夫听了外面的议论，也曾劝她莫先说大话，免得将来丢丑。
    但是，李菊梅的决心却像铁一样。她知道妇女要求彻底解放必须参加劳动，并且也听到了很多女劳动模范的事迹。她相信：只要听人民政府的话，虚心学习生产经验，坚持努力，丰产是一定可以成功的。半年的时间，她终于克服了种种困难，创造了千斤丰产的成绩。
    从一个不懂生产的妇女到千斤丰产者，这条路是不容易走的。插秧开始了，李菊梅热情地打起赤脚下了田；但困难也就迎着她来了：有经验的农民插得又快又好，但她却插得像一条龙似的。光凭热情是不够的，还得艰苦地学习——她马上抓着秧去找师傅。戴金林互助组组员刘金生实地教她插秧的方法后，她觉得插得好多了，但又去请老农民提意见。戴金林检查了她插的秧，高兴地说：“别的都合规矩了，就是横筒太短。”就这样，她逐渐学会了插秧。除莠草时，她连稗子和禾苗都分不清，她又向老农民请教。看水、薅田、扮禾……，她也学会了。现在，除了犁耙以外，田里活她都能做了。
    初学作田，手脚总比别人慢；李菊梅用毅力战胜了这个困难。薅二道田时，太阳像火球似的。别人在中午都休息了，她却在火热的太阳底下一脚一脚、一行一行薅过去，汗流得满脸，她也顾不得擦。晚上散工时，她薅的田并不比别人少。有一天，大家正在田里扯草，突然暴风骤雨来了。满垄的人都飞跑回家；她想起自己的田如果不塞好水路、不打开口子，山洪下来禾苗会被淹坏。她留在田里，冒着雨照样做活。两个多钟头后雨停了，她头发缝里都灌满了水，但心里却热呼呼的。旁的农民对着她笑，她自己也笑，回家换了身衣服又下田干起来了。在积肥运动时，她每天跟着戴金林互助组进城挑煤灰、垃圾灰，一天挑好几次，就这样解决了追肥的困难。
    “听人民政府的话”，是李菊梅丰产的重要原因之一。播种前，省农林厅号召推广良种“万粒籼”。很多农民说“万粒籼”靠不住，种后不能种豆。但李菊梅说：“人民政府做那一宗事不是为人民好！”她带头用了“万粒籼”。秋收时，乡里十多号禾种就数“万粒籼”好；并且，也没有影响了种豆。人民政府介绍了李呈桂施肥经验，她便学习做了。有些农民劝她说：肥下多了，没谷收；但她坚信“人民政府推广的经验没错”。禾苗有了足够的肥料，叶子密密的针都插不进；她的心也甜甜的。抽齐了籼子，禾对好了花，突然刮了一阵大风，满田禾苗一下都倒了。谁知第二天一出太阳，李菊梅的禾苗一兜一兜又站起来了。她站在田边高兴地微笑着，她说：“人民政府推广的种子和介绍的经验到底不会错！”
    李菊梅丰产成功了。收下谷子，晒干车净，平均每亩干谷一千零五十七斤。这是全乡中稻最高产量之一，比去年这块田多产一倍。扮禾那天，戴金林互助组的组员们拢了场，工作组验收过的秤。
    北望乡轰动了，到处都钦羡地谈论着这件事。戴金林说：“李菊梅去年上民校，一个冬天学会了写信。今年搞丰产，半年就成了千斤户。真是新社会的新人物！”过去说冷话的人现在也心服了。很多妇女增强了参加田间生产的信心，围绕在她的周围学做活了。
    但是，李菊梅还是很虚心地向大家说：“我还没学熟犁耙，还没参加互助组，今年田里还有三箩乙谷。要继续努力才行！”
