Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th: The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a five-day "Conference of Advanced Producers in Basic Construction" on November 30th. More than 680 representatives attended the conference, all of whom were labor models and advanced producers from various basic construction sites. This conference extensively exchanged and summarized more than fifty types of advanced experiences with universal significance for promotion. This is of great significance for large-scale economic construction next year.

Over the past year, many advanced experiences have emerged in the basic construction sector of Northeast China. For example, in terms of design work, Yu Bangrui, the representative of the Civil Architecture Design Company of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, vividly reported at the meeting that they had changed their bourgeois design ideology and learned from the Soviet Union's advanced design standards. As a result, they saved the state 200 billion yuan in investment in the design of two million square meters of civil and architectural engineering. In terms of mechanical and electrical installation, the reports from the representatives of Fuxin Power Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel Company fully demonstrated that they have been able to install the newest and most complex machinery with the most advanced technology. In terms of civil construction, Wang Sunci, the construction site director of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau, learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and, in combination with specific circumstances, created a segmented parallel assembly line operation method, shortening the originally planned 120-day project to 40 days. Gu Yuechuan, an engineer from the Sixty-First Engineering Company, successfully completed a plant building originally scheduled to take 180 days in 70 days after implementing construction according to the instruction chart.

After listening to the reports and discussions, the representatives of each unit deeply realized that learning from advanced experiences is an important way to accelerate national industrialization. The installation experience of the Fuxin Power Plant installation team was highly valued by the representatives, and the conference requested them to make three introductions successively. The conference adopted the method of learning from each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses, making the content of many advanced experiences, especially those with decisive significance, richer. For example, in terms of drilling, Yang Chunfa's advanced experience from the Nonferrous Metals System and Ma Wenzhi's advanced experience from the Coal Mine System were both rapid drilling methods, but one was suitable for hard rock layers and the other was suitable for soft rock layers. After the conference exchanged experiences, the drilling efficiency will be further improved in the future. Furthermore, the topsoil excavation and well frame installation experience of the Fuxin Mining Bureau was very good; the rapid excavation efficiency of the Xi'an Mining Bureau was the highest; and the Jixi Mining Bureau created a new national record in bricklaying on well walls. The conference combined these three characteristics to create a complete set of advanced well-building methods.

Through this conference, the representatives of each unit have a clearer understanding of the significance and role of advanced experience. For example, in the past, when promoting the advanced experience of parallel assembly line operations according to instruction charts, some units believed that many conditions were needed, and therefore emphasized objective reasons and were slow to promote it. After being educated by many examples at the conference, many representatives realized that any project has the conditions to promote this advanced experience, and they also learned that this is currently the most important advanced construction management method.

In addition, this conference also made the representatives realize the importance of cadres and technicians earnestly learning from advanced experience in the widespread promotion of advanced experience. Many representatives not only recorded the typical reports in detail at the meeting, but also carefully recorded the introductions of the explainers when visiting the Northeast Basic Construction Exhibition held by the conference, and also recorded the models of various new tools and the diagrams of various advanced experiences in the manual one by one.

On the last day of the conference, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, gave a speech (full text will be published separately, see page two). He called on the representatives to rapidly increase the strength of basic construction, summarize and promote advanced experiences in basic construction, and especially to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union so that basic construction can truly be fast, good, and economical. Lin Feng personally awarded prizes before the end of the conference. The representatives who won prizes included: the Fuxin Power Plant Installation Engineering Team, the Xi'an Shaft Engineering Team and the team's Gu Faming Rock Drilling Group, advanced producer Wang Sunci, and other 122 units, groups, and individuals.

    东北开基本建设先进生产者代表会议
    交流和总结基本建设先进经验
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北人民政府工业部和东北总工会在十一月三十日联合召开了历时五天的“基本建设先进生产者代表会议”。参加会议的代表有六百八十多名，都是各基本建设工地的劳动模范和先进生产者。这次会议广泛地交流和总结了五十多种具有普遍推广意义的先进经验。这对明年的大规模经济建设有非常重要的意义。
    一年来，东北基本建设部门出现了许多先进经验。如在设计工作方面，东北人民政府工业部土木建筑设计公司代表愈邦瑞，在会上生动地报告了他们改变资产阶级的设计思想，学习苏联的先进设计标准，因而，在设计二百万平方公尺的土木建筑工程中给国家节省了二千亿元的投资。在机电安装方面，阜新发电厂和鞍山钢铁公司代表的报告，充分说明他们已经能够以最先进的技术安装最新式、最复杂的机械。在土木建筑方面，东北电器工业管理局哈尔滨工程处工地主任王孙慈学习苏联先进经验，结合具体情况创造了分段平行流水作业法，把原计划一百二十天完成的工程，缩短到四十天完成。六十一工程公司工程师顾月川实行按指示图表施工后，在七十天内胜利完成了原定一百八十天完工的厂房。
    各单位的代表经过听报告和讨论，都深刻地体会到学习先进经验是加速国家工业化的重要途径。阜新发电厂安装工程队的安装经验，受到代表的很大重视，会议要求他们先后作了三次介绍。会议采取了取长补短的办法，使许多先进经验特别是具有决定性的先进经验的内容都更加丰富。如在钻探方面，有色金属系统的杨春发的先进经验和煤矿系统的马文志的先进经验，虽然都是快速钻进法，但一个适用于硬岩层，一个适用于软岩层，经会议交流经验之后，今后的钻探效率都将更加提高。又如阜新矿务局的表土掘进和井架安装经验很好；西安矿务局的快速掘进效率最高；鸡西矿务局在井壁砌砖上创造了全国新纪录。会议把这三个特点合在一起，就出现了一套完整的先进的建井方法。
    经过这次会议，各单位的代表都更加明确地认识了先进经验的意义和作用。譬如过去推广按指示图表实行平行流水作业的先进经验时，有些单位认为需要许多条件，因而强调客观原因而迟迟不去推广。经过大会上许多实例的教育以后，许多代表认识到任何一个工程都是有条件推广这个先进经验的，并且了解到这是目前最重要的先进施工管理方法。
    此外，这次会议还使代表们认识到在普遍推广先进经验中，干部、技术人员必须认真学习先进经验的重要性。许多代表不仅在会议上详细地记录了典型报告，在参观大会举办的东北区基本建设展览会时，也都逐条记录了说明员的介绍，还把各种新工具的模型和各种先进经验图样一一记入手册。
    大会的最后一天，由东北人民政府副主席林枫讲话（全文另发，见第二版），他号召代表们要迅速地增长基本建设的力量，总结和推广基本建设的先进经验，特别要很好地学习苏联的先进经验，使基本建设真正做到又快、又好、又省。林枫在大会结束前亲自发奖。得奖的代表有：阜新发电厂安装工程队、西安竖井工程队及该队的谷发明凿岩小组、先进生产者王孙慈等一百二十二个单位、小组和个人。
