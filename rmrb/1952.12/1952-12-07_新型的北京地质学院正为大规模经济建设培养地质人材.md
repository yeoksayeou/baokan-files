    The new "Beijing Geological College" was established after the restructuring of higher education institutions this year and officially opened on November 1st. It is of great significance in training geological talent needed for China's large-scale economic construction.

    The Beijing Geological College was formed and expanded on the basis of all the faculty and students of the Geology Departments of Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Tianjin University, all the teachers and some students of the Geology Group of the Mining Department of Tangshan Railway College, and some students of the Geology Department of Northwest University. Currently, the college has more than 1,550 students, including 1,200 freshmen enrolled this summer. In addition, there are several graduate students. There are more than 130 teachers, and Professor Garinin, a Soviet mineral crystallography expert who taught at the Geological College of Moscow University for 19 years, has been specially invited to provide guidance in teaching. The undergraduate program of Beijing Geological College is currently divided into three departments: Mineral Geology and Exploration, Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology, and Geophysical Exploration. The Mineral Geology and Exploration Department temporarily has two majors: "Mineral Geology and Exploration" and "Petroleum and Natural Gas Geology and Exploration". The other two departments each temporarily have one major. The study period for each department is four years. In addition, in order to train geological and mineral exploration cadres in a short period of time, there is also a two-year specialized course. Among the freshmen enrolled this summer, 100 are students of the specialized course.

    Beijing Geological College will be built according to the advanced experience and scale of the Geological College of Moscow University. The four-year undergraduate teaching plan and syllabus are adapted from the five-year teaching plan and syllabus of the Geological College of Moscow University. First-year students are now being taught according to this plan and syllabus, and the vast majority of teaching materials will be adopted from the Geological College of Moscow University. The teaching time adopts the Soviet higher education system of "eight-one-five-zero": students spend a total of 50 hours per week on classroom learning, internships, and self-study. There are three classes every morning from 8:00 am to 1:15 pm, each class is divided into two sections, each section is 45 minutes; there is one hour of recreational activities and two hours of self-study in the afternoon, and two hours of self-study in the evening. Teachers also participate in tutoring during self-study time. In terms of equipment, new-style instruments worth 199 billion RMB have been ordered from the Soviet Union. To expand capacity, Beijing Geological College will build a new campus next year. The new campus will have laboratories for physics, chemistry, minerals, geology, paleontology, historical geology, petrology and mineral deposits, hydrogeology, and engineering geology, as well as a machine factory and a slide projection room.

    China has extremely rich underground resources, but during the Kuomintang rule, the exploration and development of resources depended on imperialism. The Kuomintang reactionary government never paid attention to training domestic talent to explore and develop domestic resources. Therefore, before liberation, although some universities had geology departments, the teaching content was far from practical needs, and students were only taught general theoretical geology knowledge; at the same time, equipment was simple, teachers were lacking, and there were very few students. According to Professor Zhang Xiti, the Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs of Beijing Geological College, who taught in the Geology Department of Tsinghua University for many years, the Geology Department of Tsinghua University had approximately five or six graduates in 1936 and only four graduates in 1937. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the number of graduates from geology departments of various universities was even smaller. Therefore, there are very few geological talents with university degrees or above in China. Some geological talents had already changed careers because they could not find jobs during the Kuomintang rule. After liberation, the geology departments of universities improved teaching and expanded enrollment, and the number of graduates increased compared to the past, but because the original foundation was too poor, it was still far behind actual needs. The undergraduate program of the newly established Beijing Geological College aims to train geological engineers, and graduates will be able to be competent in geological exploration and solve various geological problems in mines after a short period of internship. Graduates of specialized courses can also be engaged in resource reconnaissance and general survey work. Adapting to this training goal, the teaching content of Beijing Geological College is not only highly specialized on a solid theoretical basis, but also focuses on production internships. The production internship time for the third year of the undergraduate program accounts for seven weeks, and the fourth year accounts for ten weeks. The production internship time for the second year of the specialized course accounts for eight weeks.

    In order to continuously improve teaching, ensure the completion of teaching plans, and improve professional skills, the teachers of Beijing Geological College have now organized eleven teaching and research sections, including geology, petrology and mineral deposits, chemistry, and physics, and two teaching and research groups. In order to facilitate learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the teachers decided to start on December 10th to intensively study Russian for 200 hours using an accelerated method, requiring them to be able to read professional Russian textbooks.

    In order to solve the need for a large number of geological talents with engineering technology for China's large-scale economic construction, Beijing Geological College will expand year by year. It is estimated that in four years, the number of students enrolled will be expanded to 8,000. From that time on, thousands of geological talents can be trained from Beijing Geological College every year to participate in the great construction work of the motherland.

### 新型的北京地质学院正为大规模经济建设培养地质人材

    新型的北京地质学院正为大规模经济建设培养地质人材
    新型的“北京地质学院”在今年高等学校调整后已宣告成立，并已在十一月一日开学。它在培养我国大规模经济建设所需要的地质人材方面，具有重要的意义。
    北京地质学院是以清华大学、北京大学、天津大学地质系的全部师生，唐山铁道学院采矿系地质组的全部教师和一部分学生和西北大学地质系的部分学生为基础加以扩充而成的。目前全院有学生一千五百五十多人，其中一千二百人是今年暑期招收的新生。此外并有若干研究生。教师有一百三十多人，并特地聘请了曾在莫斯科大学地质学院执教十九年的苏联矿物结晶学专家加里宁教授担任教学方面的指导工作。北京地质学院本科现在分三个系：矿产地质及勘探系、水文地质工程地质系以及地球物理探矿系。矿产地质及勘探系暂设有“矿产地质及勘探”“石油与天然气地质及勘探”两个专业，其他两个系各暂设一个专业。各系学习年限都是四年。另外为了在短期中培养地质矿产勘察干部，并设有两年制的专修科，今年暑期招收的新生中有一百名新生是专修科的学生。
    北京地质学院将根据苏联莫斯科大学地质学院的先进经验并按照它的规模来建设。本科四年的教学计划和教学大纲都是根据莫斯科大学地质学院五年制的教学计划和教学大纲缩编而成，现在对一年级的学生已按照这个计划和大纲进行教学，极大部分教材将采用莫斯科大学地质学院的教材。教学时间是采用苏联高等学校的“八一五○”制：学生每周课堂学习、实习、自修时间共五十小时，每天上午八点到下午一点十五分之间上三堂课，每堂课分两小节，每小节四十五分钟；下午有一小时的文娱活动和两小时的自修，晚上还有两小时的自修。自修时间并有教师参加辅导。仪器设备方面，已向苏联订购了价值一千九百九十亿元人民币的新式仪器。为了扩大容量，北京地质学院明年将建筑新校舍。新校舍内将有物理、化学、矿物、地质、古生物、地史、岩石矿床、水文地质、工程地质等实验室、还有机械工厂和幻灯片放映室。
    我国有着极丰富的地下资源，但在国民党统治时期，资源的勘探和开发都依赖帝国主义，国民党反动政府从不注意培养本国人材来勘探和开发本国的资源。所以在解放以前，虽有些大学设有地质系，但教学内容远离实际需要，教给学生的只是一些一般的理论地质方面的知识；同时设备简陋、师资缺乏，学生寥寥无几。据曾在清华大学地质系执教多年、现任北京地质学院副教务长张席禔教授说：清华大学地质系一九三六年毕业生大概是五、六人，一九三七年毕业生仅四人，抗日战争胜利以后，各大学地质系毕业生更少。所以现在我国具有大学以上程度的地质人材为数极少，有些地质人材由于在国民党统治时期找不到工作，早已改了行。解放以后，大学的地质系改进教学、扩大招生，毕业生较前增加，但由于原来的基础太差，还是远远地落在实际需要的后面。新成立的北京地质学院本科的培养目标是培养地质工程师，毕业出来的学生经过短期实习后就能胜任地质勘探以及解决矿山中各种地质方面的问题。专修科毕业的学生，也能担任资源的预查及普查工作。适应着这个培养目标，北京地质学院的教学内容不但在巩固的理论基础上高度专业化，而且注重生产实习，本科第三学年的生产实习时间占七周，第四学年占十周。专修科第二学年的生产实习时间占八周。
    北京地质学院的教师们为了不断地改进教学、保证完成教学计划和提高业务水平，现已组织了地质、岩石矿床、化学、物理等十一个教研室和两个教研小组。为了便于学习苏联先进经验，教师们决定从十二月十日开始，用速成办法突击学习俄文二百小时，要求达到能阅读专业俄文教科书的程度。
    为了解决我国大规模经济建设所需要的能掌握工程技术的大量地质人材，北京地质学院将逐年扩充，预计四年以后在校学生可扩充到八千人。从那个时候开始，每年就可以有成千的地质人材从北京地质学院培养出来参加祖国的伟大建设工作。
