Brief Economic Commentary:

    The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of China have summarized the Guo Xiuyun Operating Method and decided to promote it throughout the national postal and telecommunications system to drive production reform in the system. This is another example of summarizing advanced experiences from the masses after the "Full-Load Over-Axis Five Hundred Kilometer Movement" and the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and the "1951 Weaving Method."
    The experience of the postal and telecommunications departments in summarizing the Guo Xiuyun Operating Method tells us: leading cadres at all levels of enterprises must pay attention to discovering new experiences of the masses at all times, personally study the experiences created by the masses, and carefully summarize them, rather than stopping at general appeals. At present, employees in various enterprise departments have created many advanced experiences and enthusiastically put forward many rationalization proposals. However, because some enterprise leading cadres have not conducted specific research or systematic summarization, many advanced experiences have not been able to give full play to their role, and they have not been able to find a complete set of advanced experiences that can drive the progress of various departments of the enterprise.
    What issues should be paid attention to when summarizing advanced experiences? According to the experience of the postal and telecommunications departments in summarizing the Guo Xiuyun Operating Method, it is necessary to have a clear purpose, carefully study the characteristics of the enterprise, and identify key advanced experiences. Because the leading cadres of the postal and telecommunications departments clearly recognized the great significance of improving long-distance telephone work, and that the key to improving long-distance telephone work lies in whether the switchboard operators' operating methods are appropriate, they grasped this key. They used advanced methods measured by Soviet technology and, based on advanced Soviet experience, systematically summarized the four basic characteristics of the Guo Xiuyun Operating Method, and smoothly found a complete set of advanced experiences. This method of summarizing advanced experiences is worthy of study by various regions and departments.

    学习总结郭秀云操作法的经验
    中央邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会总结了郭秀云操作法，并决定在全国邮电系统中加以推广以带动邮电系统的生产改革。这是继“满载超轴五百公里运动”和“郝建秀工作法”、“一九五一织布工作法”之后又一个总结群众先进经验的范例。
    邮电部门总结郭秀云操作法的经验告诉我们：各级企业领导干部必须随时注意发现群众的新经验，并亲自动手来研究群众创造的经验，认真地加以总结，不应停留在一般的号召上。目前各企业部门的职工创造了很多先进经验，热情地提出了很多合理化建议，但由于有些企业领导干部没有具体地进行研究，也没有进行系统的总结，以致有许多先进经验还不能充分发挥作用，也找不出能带动本企业各部门前进的一整套的先进经验来。
    总结先进经验应该注意什么问题呢？根据邮电部门总结郭秀云操作法的经验，就是必须有明确的目的，要周密研究本企业的特点，找出带有关键性的先进经验。邮电部门的领导干部由于明确认识了提高长途电话工作具有重大意义，而提高长途电话工作的主要关键是在于接续台话务员操作方法得当与否，抓住了这个关键，他们运用苏联技术测定的先进方法，并依据苏联的先进经验，系统地总结出郭秀云操作法的四个基本特点，顺利地找出一整套的先进经验来。这种总结先进经验的方法，是值得各地区、各部门研究和学习的。
