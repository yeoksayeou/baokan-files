    Xi'an Coal Mine Shaft Sinking Project Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The shaft sinking project of the Northeast Xi'an Mining Bureau started in November 1950, originally planned to be completed in seven years. Due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, it was completed victoriously at the end of August this year, five years and two months ahead of the original plan. The project specifications and quality fully meet the prescribed standards, the cost was reduced by 40%, and a large number of skilled workers were also trained. This project has set a good example for the construction of coal mine shafts in New China.
    The Xi'an Mining Bureau's shaft project is of a grand scale, with two main and auxiliary shafts, each with a depth of more than 500 meters and a wellhead diameter of 6 to 8 meters. During the 20 months of construction, 57,126 cubic meters of rock were excavated, and more than 18,051,000 cubic meters of brick and concrete were laid. When this project started, it adopted the backward single-line operation method, and the construction was not organized according to the instructions and charts. Moreover, at that time, there were many problems such as shallow drilling, many misfires, many abandoned holes, broken water pumps, insufficient lifting capacity, untimely supply of materials, simple employee safety and welfare facilities, and unreasonable wages. As a result, the daily progress was only 0.5 to 0.7 meters, the highest monthly record was only 18 meters, and a cycle of one process could not be completed in one day and night.
    In July 1950, after the Soviet expert Shmankov arrived at the Xi'an Mine, he helped the engineering team workers organize rhythmic production according to the construction schedule instruction chart and the cycle instruction chart, and promoted the parallel operation method. At the beginning, many employees still doubted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Some said: "It's good, but it can't be done." Some said: "It's too dangerous to drill rocks below and build walls above!" After repeated education to the employees by the Party, the administration, and the trade union, and organizing employees to discuss and discuss, the employees of the engineering team quickly understood the superiority of the Soviet advanced experience, and carried out a series of production technology and equipment reforms based on the Soviet experience.
    In order to quickly lift the excavated rock, manual rock loading was changed to mechanical rock loading. In the past, manual rock loading could only load six buckets of rock per hour (each bucket has a volume of 1.4 cubic meters). In one day and night (16 hours), only 52% of the excavated rock could be loaded, which affected the drilling work of the first shift on the second day. Under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, two rock loading machines were installed on each well, and machines were used to load rock, which could load 20 buckets per hour, and all the rock could be lifted out within 16 hours. Each well also saved six workers. The volume of the hoisting bucket was also changed from 0.8 cubic meters to 1.4 cubic meters. The lifting capacity has increased by 75% compared to before.
    According to the opinion of Soviet experts, the method of deep drilling was also implemented. The deep drilling method requires three kinds of drill bits with different thicknesses. First, drill with a thick drill bit, and then drill with a long and thin drill bit. Previously, each time a hole was drilled, it only advanced 1.5 meters. Later, each time a hole was drilled, it could advance 2.2 meters. This is the basic factor to speed up rock drilling.
    After improving the excavation and lifting capacity, it is possible to carry out rhythmic production according to the cycle instruction chart. The first shift drills and blasts, the second shift lifts rocks, and the third shift lifts rocks and cleans the bottom of the well, performing one cycle of process in one day and night. The excavation speed is often maintained at 1.7 to 2.2 meters per day (including the time of minor accidents).
    At the same time, the parallel operation method was implemented. Rock drilling and wall construction were carried out at the same time. The wall was built above, and the rock was drilled below. There are three hanging platforms in the well, the first is the well protection platform (fixed platform), the second is the wall construction platform, and the third is the rock drilling protection platform. A winch was added in the well for transporting materials for wall construction, and a concrete mixer was installed to improve the mixing capacity. In this way, rock drilling and wall construction do not affect each other, eliminating the large amount of idle work in the past when the wall was built after the rock was drilled, and the rock was drilled again after the wall was built. The monthly excavation efficiency can reach more than 56 meters at most.
    In the construction process, paying attention to timely improvement of workers' safety and welfare and protecting the health of employees is also an important reason for achieving success. When the rock was drilled to 64 meters from the ground, deeper than the sandstone aquifer, it rained heavily in the well. Therefore, many employees suffered from back and leg diseases, abdominal pain, arthritis, and dampness, and the attendance rate also dropped, which affected the health of the workers and the progress of the project. The leadership bought 17 sun lamps, and after each shift, the workers took a bath and then illuminated with the sun lamp for five minutes. Soon, these diseases were eradicated. Employees responded well to this equipment, saying: "You can do without food, but you can't do without sun lamp illumination." Raincoats, water boots, glasses, gloves, and masks are issued to workers on time. Clubs, canteens, bathhouses, medical clinics, classrooms, work clothes, and insurance devices for entering the well are also available. Wages have also been improved, and a piece-rate wage system based on job grades has been implemented. After improving the technology, the workers not only learned the well-digging technology, but also increased their income. Previously, some workers who were unwilling to engage in basic construction work also wanted to do it.
    There are also many shortcomings in this work. The main ones are that geological surveys and designs lag behind construction. The Xi'an shaft is basically constructed first and then designed, so that many projects such as factory buildings, offices, and mechanical installations do not meet the requirements. After the technical design is made in the future, many buildings will have to be rearranged. Secondly, the railway laying was relatively late. It was not until the well construction was completed that the railway was opened to traffic. Therefore, all the equipment used in the construction had to be transported by trucks and horse-drawn carriages, which increased a lot of transportation costs. Third, because the lifting capacity was not estimated correctly in advance, the insufficient lifting capacity hindered the further improvement of excavation efficiency. The lifting equipment for both wells only has one 300-horsepower winch, which can only lift 10 to 15 buckets of rock (with a volume of 1.4 meters) per hour, and can only lift the rock with a daily progress of 1.8 meters at most. Therefore, the monthly progress cannot be maintained at 50 meters to 60 meters frequently. It is necessary to remember these experiences and lessons when building new shaft projects in the future.

    西安煤矿竖井井筒建筑工程提前竣工
    东北西安矿务局竖井井筒建筑工程，自一九五○年十一月开工后，原计划七年完成，因为学习了苏联的先进经验，较原计划提前五年零二个月，于今年八月末已胜利完工。工程规格、质量完全符合规定标准，降低成本百分之四十，还培养出大量技术工人。这项工程，给新中国建筑煤矿竖井树立了良好的榜样。
    西安矿务局竖井工程规模宏大，有主副井筒两个，深度均在五百公尺以上，井口直径六公尺至八公尺。在二十个月的施工中，掘岩五万七千一百二十六立方公尺，砌砖、打混凝土一亿八千零五十一万多立方公尺。这项工程开始施工的时候，采用的是落后的单行作业法，也不按指示图表组织施工，而且，当时存在着打眼浅、瞎炮多、废眼多、水泵坏、提升能力不足、供应材料不及时、职工安全福利设施简陋、工资不合理等许多问题。因而日进只有零点五至零点七公尺，月进最高纪录只有十八公尺，一昼夜作不到一个工序的循环。
    一九五○年七月，苏联专家石曼阔到了西安矿后，便帮助工程队职工按施工日程指示图表和循环指示图表组织有节奏的生产，推行平行作业法。开始，许多职工对苏联的先进经验还抱怀疑态度，有的说：“好是好，就是办不到。”有人说：“下边凿岩，上边砌壁，太危险呀！”经过党、行政、工会各方面向职工反复进行教育，组织职工座谈讨论，工程队职工很快地领会了苏联先进经验的优越性。并根据苏联的经验进行了一系列生产技术和设备的改革。
    为使凿下的岩石能很快地提升出来，把用人工装岩改为用机械装岩。过去人工装岩，每小时只能装岩石六桶（每桶容积一点四立方公尺）。一昼夜（十六小时）仅能装出凿下的岩石的百分之五十二，影响第二天第一班的打眼工作。经苏联专家具体指导，在每个井上安上两台装岩机，用机器装岩，每小时便可装二十桶，十六小时内便可把岩石全部提升出来。每个井还节省了六个人工。吊桶的容积也由零点八立方公尺改为一点四立方公尺。提升能力较前提高百分之七十五。
    按照苏联专家意见，也实行了深打眼的方法。深打眼法要用粗细不同的三种钎子，先用粗钎子打，再用长的细的钎子打。以前每打一次眼，只进一点五公尺，后来，每打一次眼，可进二点二公尺了。这是加快凿岩速度的基本因素。
    提高掘进和提升的能力后，便可以按循环指示图表进行有节奏的生产了。第一班打眼放炮，第二班提升岩石，第三班提升岩石和清理井底，一昼夜进行一次工序的循环。掘进速度经常保持日进一点七到二点二公尺（发生小事故的时间在内）。
    与此同时，实行了平行作业法、凿岩、砌壁同时进行，上边砌壁，下边凿岩。井内设有三个吊盘，第一个是砌井保护盘（固定盘），第二个是砌壁工作盘，第三个是凿岩保护盘。井内增设一台绞车，供砌壁运送材料用，并安置了混凝土搅拌机，提高搅拌能力。这样，凿岩、砌壁互不影响，消除了过去凿岩之后再砌壁，砌壁后再凿岩的大量窝工现象。每月的掘进效率，最高可达五十六公尺多。
    在建筑过程中，注意及时改进工人的安全福利，保护职工身体健康，也是获得成就的重要原因。当凿岩凿到距地面六十四公尺，深过沙岩含水层时，井内如下大雨。因此，职工患腰腿病、腹痛、关节炎、潮湿病者很多，出勤率也下降，影响了工人身体健康和工程进度。领导方面便购买了十七台太阳灯，每班工人下班沐浴后，照太阳灯五分钟。不久，这些疾病便根除了。职工对这种设备反映很好，说：“饭不吃可以，不照照太阳灯不行。”雨衣、水靴、眼镜、手套、口罩，按期发给工人。俱乐部、食堂、浴池、医疗所、教室、工作服、入井保险装置等，也都有了。工资也改进了，实行了按工种分等计件工资制。改进技术后，工人不但学会了打井技术，收入也多了。以前有些不愿干基本建设工作的工人，也都想干了。
    在这项工作中，也存在不少缺点。其中主要是地质勘察和设计落在施工后面。西安竖井，基本上是先施工而后设计，以致厂房、办公室、机械安装等很多工程，都不合要求。将来技术设计作出后，许多建筑都要重新安排。其次，铁路铺修较迟，直到井筒建设完毕，才开始通车。因而，建筑时用的全部器材，不得不用汽车和马车运输，增加不少运输费。第三，因为事先对提升能力估量不正确，致因提升能力不足，阻碍了掘进效率进一步提高。两井提升设备，都只有三百马力绞车一台，每小时仅能提升岩石十至十五桶（容一点四公尺），最多只能提升出日进一点八公尺进度的岩石。每月的月进度，因此不能经常保持五十公尺到六十公尺。今后在建设新的竖井工程时，记取这些经验教训是必要的。（王树人、李檇、仇绍文）
