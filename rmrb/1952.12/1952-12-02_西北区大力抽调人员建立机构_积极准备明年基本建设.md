    [This News Report] Northwest region's capital construction departments are actively preparing for capital construction in 1953. The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee has begun summarizing the experiences of key capital construction projects. At the end of October, it dispatched ten work teams to various provinces, cities, major factories, and mines to assist units in compiling the 1953 capital construction plan. Recently, it dispatched special inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections of capital construction work in various locations.

    Many departments, in order to adapt to the needs of the large-scale capital construction work starting next year, have reorganized their capital construction institutions. Departments that previously lacked capital construction institutions have begun to establish them. The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department has established specialized capital construction institutions in the textile, electric power, coal, and machinery sectors. Among them, the Textile Engineering Company and the Thermal Power Engineering Company are stepping up preparations for their establishment. To improve the work of surveying underground resources, the Northwest Resource Survey Bureau will greatly strengthen the work of geological, drilling, surveying and mapping, and testing institutions next year. The coal industry also plans to organize a drilling team during the winter and establish drilling teams in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, respectively. The Northwest Petroleum Administration's oilfields will establish capital construction sections. The Yumen Oilfield will establish a Petroleum Installation and Construction Engineering Company. Provinces and cities will also establish construction engineering bureaus or construction engineering offices according to actual needs.

    In order to strengthen the capital construction forces, various departments are vigorously concentrating cadres to strengthen capital construction institutions. The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Personnel Department, based on the principle of "concentrated use, key allocation," in October, allocated 510 graduates from six universities and colleges in the Northwest this year and higher education graduates from other administrative regions allocated to the Northwest to various capital construction departments. This group of cadres accounted for more than 36 percent of the total number of cadres transferred this time. In addition, a large number of cadres were transferred from various places to capital construction departments. The first batch of cadres transferred to various units of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department alone included more than 80 county heads, county party secretaries, district heads, and district party secretaries. Production departments have also transferred a large number of outstanding cadres, technicians, and technical workers to capital construction departments. For example, the Northwest's three state-owned cotton textile mills are gradually transferring a large number of employees to take on new capital construction tasks.

    Units currently engaged in capital construction are not only working hard to complete this year's capital construction tasks but also actively preparing for next year's capital construction. The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Transportation Department plans to concentrate cadres and train workers in order to assign them to highway construction projects in ethnic minority areas such as Qinghai next year. Northwest state-owned construction enterprises will complete the work of clearing assets and verifying funds this winter to lay the foundation for implementing the economic accounting system. The companies under the Northwest Construction Engineering General Administration are carrying out the work of fixing workers, planning to absorb one-third of the existing total number of workers as long-term workers, and conducting training during the winter. The Northwest Construction Engineering General Administration will concentrate technical personnel and financial personnel in Xi'an and Xianyang to study Soviet advanced experience and the experience of capital construction in the Northeast and formulate various systems and regulations to improve work. In terms of standard house design, dozens of standard drawings for doors and windows have been completed successively. This work will play a significant role in saving design time and improving design quality.

    西北区大力抽调人员建立机构
    积极准备明年基本建设
    【本报讯】西北区各基本建设部门，正积极进行一九五三年基本建设的准备工作。西北军政委员会财政经济委员会，已着手总结各重点基本建设工程的经验；并于十月底派出十个工作队，分赴各省、市，各大厂、矿，协助各单位编制一九五三年基本建设计划；最近又专门派出检查组，赴各地深入检查基本建设工作。
    许多部门为了适应明年开始的大规模基本建设工作的需要，已重新整顿基本建设机构。过去没有基本建设机构的部门，也开始建立了起来。西北军政委员会工业部在纺织、电力、煤业、机械等部门，都设立了基本建设专业机构；其中纺织工程公司，火电工程公司，正加紧筹备建立中。为了做好地下资源的勘察工作，西北资源勘测局明年将大力加强地质、钻探、测绘、化验机构的工作。煤业部门也准备在冬季筹备组织一个钻探队，及在陕西、甘肃、新疆分别设立钻探队。西北石油管理局所属的各油矿，将设立基本建设处。玉门油矿并成立石油装建工程公司。各省、市也将根据实际需要，分别成立建筑工程局或建筑工程处。
    为了加强基本建设力量，各部门正大力集中干部，充实基本建设机构。西北军政委员会人事部，根据“集中使用，重点配备”的方针，在十月间，已将今年西北六个院校的毕业生和其他行政区分配到西北的高等学校毕业学生五百一十人，分配到各基本建设部门。这批干部占这次调配干部总人数的百分之三十六以上；此外又从各地抽调了大批干部，转入基本建设部门。仅调到西北军政委员会工业部各单位的第一批干部，就有县长、县委书记和区长、区委书记等八十多人。生产部门也把大量的优秀干部、技术人员和技术工人，输送到基本建设部门。例如西北三个国营棉纺织厂，正陆续抽调大批员工，担任新的基本建设任务。
    今年正在进行基本建设的单位，一面在紧张地争取完成今年的基本建设任务，同时也在积极进行明年基本建设的准备工作。西北军政委员会交通部正计划集中干部、训练工人，以便明年分配到青海等地去担任少数民族地区公路修建工程。西北国营建筑企业，在今年冬季将完成清理资产、核定资金工作，为实行经济核算制打下基础。西北建筑工程总管理处所属的各公司，正进行固定工人的工作，预定将现有工人总数的三分之一，吸收为长期工人，并在冬季进行训练。西北建筑工程总管理处将集中技术人员、财务人员，分别在西安和咸阳两地，学习苏联先进经验和东北基本建设的经验，并制订各种制度规程，以改进工作。在房屋标准设计方面，已先后完成门窗等标准图样数十种。这个工作，对于节省设计时间，提高设计质量，会起很大的作用。
