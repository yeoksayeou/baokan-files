    Eisenhower's "Trip to Korea"
    Thoroughly Exposes the Conspiracy of the United States to Continue and Expand the War of Aggression Against Korea
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Eisenhower has hastily completed his much-publicized trip to Korea. Facts have proven that his visit to Korea was not to fulfill his promise to "end the Korean War," but to plot to continue and expand the war.
    According to a communique issued by the US military command invading Korea on the 5th, Eisenhower secretly arrived in Korea on the 2nd. Accompanying Eisenhower to Korea were also the next US Secretary of Defense Wilson and the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley. Eisenhower held a series of meetings with the commanders of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force invading Korea, as well as the puppet Syngman Rhee, and visited the US troops invading Korea and the Syngman Rhee puppet army before leaving Korea on the 5th to return to the United States.
    Despite the strict news blockade imposed by the US authorities, foreign news agencies still revealed some of the content of the meetings held by Eisenhower. According to a report by United Press International from Seoul on the 5th, the generals of the US military invading Korea suggested to Eisenhower that they should either maintain the current "stalemate" or "prepare for a full-scale war in Korea." Agence France-Presse in Seoul reported on the 6th, citing US sources, that Eisenhower had promised to send at least two more divisions to the Korean battlefield. Agence France-Presse also reported that "well-informed sources" in Tokyo believed that Eisenhower may have asked Syngman Rhee to be patient, "because the United Nations forces must launch a large-scale offensive after receiving a large number of reinforcements."
    Eisenhower himself did not conceal that the purpose of his visit to Korea was to continue and expand the war. In a speech at a press conference held in Seoul, he completely denied the promise he had made to the American people in Pittsburgh in late October to "end the Korean War," thereby completely exposing the true colors of this liar. He said:
    "Before we came here, I had already publicly stated that we came here to understand the situation. We do not have any panaceas or tricks to solve any problems." Eisenhower indicated that the war of aggression against Korea would continue and could not but be expanded. He said:
    "What is needed is to continue to dedicate ourselves to the common goals that we have revealed so far and will continue to pursue." "In such a war, it seems very difficult to formulate a plan that can promote a definite victory without risking the serious danger of expanding the war."
    In order to avoid exposing more flaws, Eisenhower dared not answer the questions raised by reporters at the press conference. However, he will have to answer the questions of the American people who are eager for him to fulfill his promise to "end the Korean War." Precisely because of this, Eisenhower dared not return to the United States immediately. According to US news agencies, Eisenhower will convene a meeting with Dulles and others on Wake Island on his way back to the United States. In addition to planning ways to continue and expand the war, the purpose is obviously to plan how to deceive the American people in order to drive them to continue to shed blood and sell their lives for the war profits of Wall Street bosses.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: Eisenhower, who went to Korea to plot to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea, admitted after a three-day inspection that he "did not have any panaceas or tricks to solve any problems." Why did even this ambitious general have to admit this? The reason is very obvious: to continue and expand the war, the first thing is to have soldiers to fight, but he lacks soldiers, lacks cannon fodder.
    Eisenhower has been loudly advocating to continue to expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army and further drive the Rhee puppet army to die for him. However, it is not easy to continue to draft and expand the Rhee puppet army in South Korea. The hatred shown by the South Korean people this time towards Eisenhower, the representative of the American war monger, is proof of this. According to descriptions by British and American news agencies, in order to "protect" Eisenhower, tens of thousands of US troops and Syngman Rhee's puppet troops, six thousand Syngman Rhee plainclothes agents, and hundreds of American agents specially rushed from the United States turned Seoul into a city of terror. The streets and alleys were full of sentry posts. The prisons were filled with tens of thousands of innocent civilians arrested within a few days, and tens of thousands of other so-called "suspects" were driven to concentration camps outside the city. Even the Kyodo News Agency in Tokyo admitted on the 3rd: "There are still many difficulties in the future to strengthen the Korean army." The news specifically pointed out "many difficulties" in "training, personnel, equipment, and morale." For example, in terms of training, the news said: "What the Korean army urgently feels now is the training and cultivation of cadre generals and non-commissioned officers. Currently, there are a total of twenty-nine generals, lieutenant generals, and major generals in Korea, and almost all of these senior cadres are graduates of the Japanese Army Sergeant School, and none of them are graduates of the Army University. ... Many officers below the rank of captain are reserve officers of the former Japanese army, and the training period is now only six months. In particular, the education and training of non-commissioned officers is now completed in only two months. However, the need for replenishment is very urgent, because the number of combat deaths and injuries far exceeds the number of trained personnel, and it is very difficult to extend the training period." In terms of equipment, the news said: "Unfortunately, due to insufficient training in special arms, they will not use weapons." The news cited an example to illustrate the issue of morale: "In the Busan area, there have been several incidents of wounded and sick soldiers sent back to the rear carrying out collective violence against government agencies." Therefore, Kyodo News Agency admitted: "It is not easy to overcome these difficulties."
    Eisenhower also wanted to use more vassal state troops as cannon fodder. However, he could not but discover that those very fragile "allies" who had been squeezed out of breath by the United States were not so willing to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States, and even if they were willing, they were beyond their ability. The Associated Press reported on the 4th on the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference currently being held, admitting: "Among the Commonwealth countries that have troops fighting in Korea, it seems that none of them is willing to send more troops to Korea." "Senior officials of the Commonwealth countries explained that if the war in Korea is to be strengthened, it will inevitably place a new burden on the already depleted human and equipment resources of the Commonwealth."
    Therefore, if Eisenhower wants to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea, he can only drive more American youth to serve as cannon fodder. However, if he wants to do this, he cannot but immediately expose his deceptive promises during the election completely in front of the American people, thereby arousing the strong opposition of the broad masses of the American people and the dissatisfaction of the soldiers who are eagerly hoping to stop the Korean War. It is very clear that Eisenhower has absolutely no way out to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. What awaits him will only be a more tragic failure.

### 艾森豪威尔“朝鲜之行”  彻底暴露美国继续和扩大侵朝战争的阴谋

    艾森豪威尔“朝鲜之行”
    彻底暴露美国继续和扩大侵朝战争的阴谋
    【新华社八日讯】艾森豪威尔已经匆匆完成了他的喧嚷已久的朝鲜之行。事实证明：他到朝鲜去并不是为了实践他的“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言，而是为了策划继续和扩大战争。
    据侵朝美军司令部在五日发表的公报说，艾森豪威尔于二日秘密抵达朝鲜。和艾森豪威尔一同到朝鲜的，还有下一任的美国国防部长威尔逊和美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷。艾森豪威尔在和侵朝美军的陆海空军司令以及傀儡李承晚分别举行了一连串的会议，并访问了侵朝美军和李承晚伪军以后，已于五日离朝鲜返美。
    尽管美国当局实行了严密的新闻封锁，但是外国通讯社仍然透露了艾森豪威尔所举行的这些会议的一部分内容。据合众社汉城五日电报道，侵朝美军的将领们向艾森豪威尔建议，要就保持目前的“僵持”状态，要就“准备在朝鲜进行全面战争”。法新社汉城六日电根据美国方面的消息报道说，艾森豪威尔已答应至少再派两个师到朝鲜战场来。法新社还报道，东京方面的“消息灵通人士”认为，艾森豪威尔可能已要求李承晚要有耐心，“因为联合国军必须在获得了大量援军以后才能发动大规模的攻势”。
    艾森豪威尔自己也毫不掩饰他来朝鲜的目的是为了继续和扩大战争。他在汉城举行的记者招待会上发表谈话时，把他在十月下旬在美国匹兹堡向美国人民答应过的“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言抵赖得干干净净，从而使这个骗子的原形完全毕露。他说：
    “在我们没来到这里以前，我早已公开说过，我们到这里来是为了了解情况的。我们没有能够解决任何问题的万灵药和诀窍。”艾森豪威尔表示，侵略朝鲜的战争还要继续下去，并且不能不扩大。他说：
    “所需要的就是继续致力于迄今为止我们所揭示并将继续追求的共同目标。”“在这样的战争中，要拟订一个能够促成肯定的胜利而不致冒扩大战争的严重危险的计划，似乎是一件很困难的事。”
    为了避免暴露更多的马脚，艾森豪威尔不敢在记者招待会上回答记者们提出的问题，但是他将不能不回答渴望他实现“结束朝鲜战争”诺言的美国人民的质问。正因为如此，艾森豪威尔不敢马上回到美国去。据美国通讯社报道，艾森豪威尔在回国途中，将在威克岛召集杜勒斯等举行会议，其目的除了策划继续和扩大战争的办法而外，显然还要策划如何欺骗美国人民，以便驱策他们继续为华尔街老板的战争利润而流血卖命。
    【新华社开城七日电】为了策划继续和扩大进行侵朝战争而到朝鲜的艾森豪威尔，在进行了三天的视察之后，承认他“没有能够解决任何问题的万灵药和诀窍”。为什么连这个野心勃勃的将军也不得不承认这一点呢？原因是很明显的：要继续和扩大战争，首先就是要有打仗的兵，而他却缺乏兵，缺乏炮灰。
    艾森豪威尔一直大吹大擂要继续扩充李承晚伪军，进一步驱使李伪军来替死。但是在南朝鲜继续抓丁扩充李伪军并不容易，南朝鲜人民这次对艾森豪威尔这个美国战争贩子的代表人物来到朝鲜所表示的仇恨，便是证明。根据美英通讯社的描述，为了“保护”艾森豪威尔，数以万计的美军及李承晚伪军、六千名李承晚便衣特务及好几百专门从美国赶来的美国特务，把汉城变成了一座恐怖之城。大街小巷，岗哨密布。监狱里囚满了几天之内被逮捕的成万无辜平民，还有成万的其他所谓“嫌疑犯”，被驱到城外的集中营里。甚至连共同社东京三日电也承认：“要增强韩军，前途还有许多困难。”该消息具体地指出了“在训练、兵员、装备、士气等方面”的“许多困难”。如在训练方面，消息说：“现在韩军所痛切感觉到的，就是训练和培养干部将校和士官。目前韩国的将级军官，中将和少将总共有二十九名，而这些高级干部差不多都只是日本陆军士官学校毕业，没有一个是从陆军大学毕业的。……上尉以下的军官许多都是前日军的后备军官，训练期间，现在不过是六个月而已。特别是士官的教育训练，现在只用两个月期间就结束了。而其补充需要却很急迫，因为战斗死伤人数远远超过训练人数，要把训练期间延长那是非常困难的。”在装备方面，消息说：“遗憾的是由于特种兵训练不足，不会运用武器。”消息中举出了一个例子说明了士气的问题：“在釜山地区，发生了好几次送回后方的伤、病士兵对政府机关实行集体暴行的事件”。因此，共同社承认：“要克服这些困难是很不容易的”。
    艾森豪威尔同样很想利用更多的仆从国军队来当炮灰。然而，他不能不发现：那些十分脆弱并且已经被美国压榨得透不过气来的“盟国”，并不是那么愿意替美国火中取栗的，即使愿意也是力不从心。美联社四日在报道目前正在开会的英国联邦总理会议的消息中承认：“派有军队在朝鲜作战的英联邦国家中，似乎没有任何一国愿意增派部队到朝鲜去。”“英联邦各国的高级官员解释说：如果要加强朝鲜的战争，势必要使英联邦已经枯竭的人力与装备资源担负新的负担。”
    因此，艾森豪威尔要继续和扩大进行侵朝战争，就只有驱使更多的美国青年充当炮灰。但是，他要这样做就不能不使他在竞选中的骗人诺言立即在美国人民面前完全拆穿，从而激起迫切盼望停止朝鲜战争的美国广大人民的强烈反对和士兵们的不满。事情十分清楚，艾森豪威尔要继续和扩大侵朝战争，是绝对没有出路的，等待他的将只有更悲惨的失败。
