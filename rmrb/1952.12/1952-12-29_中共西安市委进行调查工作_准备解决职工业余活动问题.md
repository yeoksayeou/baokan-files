    Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Conducts Investigation to Resolve the Issue of Staff and Worker Leisure Activities

    To the Editor: After reading the article "Leisure Time of Staff and Workers at Shijingshan Power Plant Has Been Reasonably Resolved," published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on November 9th, I felt very excited. This is an important measure by our Party to value the physical health of workers and improve the production efficiency of factories and enterprises. As I understand it, the situation of long leisure time for staff and workers, many concurrent positions for cadres, and many meetings is also a serious problem in the Xi'an Power Plant and other factories and enterprises. Employees and leaders of enterprises are also eager to solve this problem. Now, the Enterprise Party Committee of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has designated two comrades to begin investigation and research work, preparing to resolve this issue in a guided and unified manner.

    中共西安市委进行调查工作
    准备解决职工业余活动问题
    编辑同志：我读了十一月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的石景山发电厂职工业余活动时间已合理解决一文后，感到非常兴奋。这是我们党重视工人身体健康，提高工厂、企业生产效率的重要措施。据我了解，职工业余活动时间长，干部兼职多，会议多的情形在西安发电厂及其他工厂、企业中同样是严重的问题，企业职工和领导方面也都迫切要求解决。现在中共西安市委企业党委已指定两个同志开始作调查研究工作，准备有领导地统一解决这一问题。　惠舜天
