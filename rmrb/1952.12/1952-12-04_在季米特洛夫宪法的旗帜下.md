　　Under the Banner of the Dimitrov Constitution
    (Buladanuofu, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party)
    The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, known to the people as the Dimitrov Constitution, was adopted by the National Assembly on December 4, 1947. This constitution legally solidified the fundamental changes and people's democratic system that occurred in Bulgaria after September 9, 1944, guiding the country to advance along the democratic path and strive for further development.

    The people's democratic revolution of September 9th, combining the national liberation struggle against Hitler's followers and fascism with the laboring people's struggle against capitalist enslavement, overthrew the rule of the bourgeoisie and established a government of the alliance of the working class and laboring peasants, laying the foundation for people's democracy. The nature of state power fundamentally changed: "The tool for suppressing and exploiting the masses for the benefit of capitalists collapsed, and the people's power, as the elimination of capitalism and the gradual abolition of all forms of exploitation, was established." (Dimitrov) Article Two of the Dimitrov Constitution stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of Bulgaria comes from and belongs to the people." The National Assembly, the highest organ of state power, and the People's Councils, the local organs of state power, are both composed of citizens elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot. All citizens of the People's Republic, upon reaching the age of eighteen, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religious belief, education level, occupation, social status, and property status, enjoy the right to vote.

    The Dimitrov Constitution reflects the achievements of the Bulgarian people's struggle to deprive the bourgeoisie of their economic position. Article Ten clearly stipulates the prohibition of all private monopolistic organizations. On the other hand, Article Seven declares that all natural resources, forests, water conservancy, railways and air transport, post, telegraph, telephone, and radio broadcasting systems are state property. Less than a few weeks after the adoption of the constitution, capitalist industrial enterprises and banks were nationalized, marking the establishment of the people's democratic system in Bulgaria, and state-owned enterprises became the main pillar of the country's economic development.

    After the implementation of nationalization, Bulgaria's socialist industry began to embark on the road of accelerated development. The industrial output in 1952 reached 425 percent of that in 1939. The output of the iron ore industry in 1952 increased by 43 times compared to 1939, and by four times compared to 1948.

    Bulgaria's machine manufacturing industry, which was almost non-existent before the September 9th Revolution, had increased by 109 times by 1952 compared to 1939.

    The chemical industry is developing at a rapid pace. Production in 1952 increased by eight times compared to 1939, and by three times compared to 1948. Following the commencement of operations at the "Stalin" Great Chemical Plant, our country's first metallurgical plant is being rapidly established, which will lay the foundation for our socialist metallurgical industry. A soda ash factory, our country's second largest chemical plant, is also under construction; a rayon factory has already started operations.

    Electrification has become the foundation for the development of productive forces in socialist construction, and electrical engineering has in fact been established after September 9, 1944. In the sixty-six years after Bulgaria's liberation from Turkish shackles, the total power generation was 108,000 kilowatts, while under the leadership of the people's democratic government, 98,500 kilowatts were generated in 1951 alone. Over the past eight years, 1,864 villages have been electrified. Following the power generation of the "Stalin," "Chervenkov," and other thermal power plants, new hydropower stations such as "Kolarov," "Klisura," "Radomirtsi," and "Asenitsa II" are about to be completed and start generating electricity.

    Fundamental changes have also taken place in agriculture, and great achievements have been made. Agricultural cooperatives, "rewarded and supported by the state and enjoying special protection" (Article Eleven of the Constitution), have achieved a decisive victory. Fifty percent of families nationwide are organized in agricultural cooperatives. In 1951 and 1952, two-thirds of the country's wheat, rye, barley, corn, and oats were supplied by socialist agricultural cooperatives, state farms, and machine tractor stations. In 1952, the mechanization of agriculture had exceeded the target set in the Five-Year Plan to be achieved in 1953. Twelve thousand tractors and one thousand combine harvesters are cultivating the land of agricultural cooperatives in our People's Republic.

    Under the banner of the Dimitrov Constitution, socialist industry, transportation, construction, and modern socialist agriculture are steadily advancing, the number of the working class is constantly increasing, and the political and productive activities of the laboring people are expanding. Inspired by the experience and example of the Soviet laboring people, and with their help, the Bulgarian laboring people enthusiastically participate in socialist competitions and shock work. The number of shock workers and Stakhanovite workers, socialist labor heroes – the new people of our working class, enthusiastic builders of socialism – is rapidly increasing. The names of Stakhanovite worker Latinka Gurobova, multi-drill operator Alexander Lengelov, cigarette industry worker Irena Boyanova, heavy-load train driver Panyu Genchev, and hundreds of other socialist labor heroes are the pride of our country.

    The Dimitrov Constitution grants the state the power to regulate and guide domestic and foreign trade; the state may exercise exclusive rights over the production and trade of goods of great significance to the national economy and the needs of the people (Article Thirteen). Today, state-owned and cooperative trade are developing into powerful means to meet the ever-increasing needs of the laboring people. This year, these two types of trade account for 98.4 percent of the total volume of commodity circulation. Private commerce, which accounted for 56.9 percent of the total volume of commodity circulation in 1947, now accounts for only 1.6 percent.

    The vigorous development of industry, agriculture, trade, and the entire economy guarantees the continuous improvement of the material and cultural standards of the laboring people. In 1951, the people's income increased by 30 percent compared to 1950, and this year it will increase by another 19 percent compared to 1951. The currency reform carried out this year and the two reductions in the prices of food and industrial products mark these achievements.

    Bulgaria's cultural undertakings, under the banner of the Dimitrov Constitution, are also increasingly consolidated and prospering. The number of primary schools, secondary schools, universities, and scientific research institutions is constantly increasing. They closely follow the achievements and experience of the world's most progressive and noble science – Soviet science – and develop accordingly.

    With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and cooperation with peace-loving people around the world, Bulgaria has achieved peaceful socialist development and stands at the forefront of the Balkans in defending peace. The Dimitrov Constitution reflects the Bulgarian people's free and happy life and their firm will to fight for socialism and friendship with all countries.

　　在季米特洛夫宪法的旗帜下
    （保加利亚共产党候补中央委员勃拉达诺夫）
    被人民称为季米特洛夫宪法的保加利亚人民共和国宪法，于一九四七年十二月四日在国民议会中通过。这个宪法以法律的条文巩固了保加利亚一九四四年九月九日以后所产生的根本变革和人民民主制度，使国家按着民主的道路前进，争取进一步的发展。
    九月九日的人民民主革命，把反对希特勒走狗和法西斯主义的民族解放斗争与劳动人民反对资本主义奴役的斗争结合起来，推翻了资产阶级的统治，建立了工人阶级和劳动农民联盟的政府，奠定人民民主的基础。国家权力的性质根本改变了，“为了资本家的利益而镇压和剥削群众的工具瓦解了，作为消灭资本主义及逐渐废除一切剥削形式的人民政权建立起来了。”（季米特洛夫）季米特洛夫宪法第二条规定：“保加利亚人民共和国全部权力，来自人民并属于人民。”国家权力的最高机关国民议会和国家权力的地方机关人民会议，都是由公民以普遍的、平等的、直接的和不记名的投票选举组成的。人民共和国的全体公民，凡年满十八岁，不分性别、民族、种族、宗教信仰、教育程度、职业、社会地位与财产状况，都享有选举的权利。
    季米特洛夫宪法反映出保加利亚人民为剥夺资产阶级经济地位而斗争的成就。第十条明白规定禁止一切私人垄断性的组织。另一方面，第七条宣布一切天然资源、森林、水利、铁道及空中交通、邮政、电报、电话和无线电广播系统均为国家财产。在宪法通过后不到几个星期，资本家的工业企业和银行便收归国有，这标志着保加利亚建立了人民民主制度，国营企业变成了国家经济发展中的主要支柱。
    在实行国有化之后，保加利亚的社会主义工业开始走上加速发展的道路。一九五二年的工业生产量达到一九三九年的百分之四百二十五。一九五二年铁矿工业的产量比一九三九年增加了四十三倍，比一九四八年增加了四倍。
    保加利亚的机器制造业在九月九日革命以前是几乎不存在的，到一九五二年已比一九三九年增加了一百零九倍。
    化学工业正以很快的速度发展。一九五二年的生产比一九三九年增加了八倍，比一九四八年增加了三倍。继“斯大林”大化学工厂开工之后，我们国家的第一个冶金工厂正在迅速建立起来，这个工厂将奠定我们社会主义冶金工业的基础。一个制碱工厂，我国第二个最大的化学工厂，也在建筑中；一个人造纤维工厂已经开工。
    电气化成为社会主义建设中生产力发展的基础，而且电气工程事实上在一九四四年九月九日以后已建立起来。保加利亚从土耳其的枷锁下解放出来以后的六十六年中，发电力一共是十万零八千千瓦，而在人民民主政府领导下，单是一九五一年就发电九万八千五百千瓦。八年来有一千八百六十四个乡村电气化。继“斯大林”、“契尔文科夫”和其他热力发电站发电之后，“科拉罗夫”、“克里苏拉”、“拉多米尔西”、“阿辛尼沙第二”等新的水力发电站即将完成，开始发电。
    在农业方面也进行了根本的变革，并获得了伟大的成就。“受国家的奖励与扶持，并享有特别的保护”（宪法第十一条）的农业合作社，取得了决定性的胜利。全国有百分之五十的家庭组织在农业合作社之中。一九五一和一九五二年全国的小麦、裸麦、大麦、玉蜀黍和燕麦，有三分之二是由社会主义性质的农业合作社、国营农场和机器拖拉机站所供应的。一九五二年农业的机械化已超过了五年计划规定在一九五三年达到的目标。有一万二千架拖拉机和一千架联合收割机在我们人民共和国农业合作社的土地上耕作。
    在季米特洛夫宪法的旗帜下，社会主义工业、运输事业、建筑业和现代社会主义农业都正在稳步前进，工人阶级的人数不断增加，劳动人民的政治活动和生产活动在扩展。在苏联劳动人民的经验和范例的鼓舞下，并在他们的帮助下，保加利亚劳动人民满怀热情地参加社会主义竞赛和突击工作。突击工人和斯塔哈诺夫工作者、社会主义劳动英雄——我们工人阶级的新人民、社会主义的热情建设者的数目在激增。斯塔哈诺夫工作者拉丁卡·古鲁波瓦、多孔钻床工人亚力山大·伦格洛夫、制烟业工人伊莲娜·波扬诺娃、重载火车司机潘由·简且夫和其他数百名社会主义劳动英雄的名字，是我们国家的骄傲。
    季米特洛夫宪法赋予国家管制和指导国内外贸易的权力；对于国民经济及人民需要具有重大意义的物品的生产与贸易，国家得实行专有（第十三条）。今天国营的和合作性的贸易正在发展成为满足劳动人民日益增加的需要的有力手段。今年这两种贸易在全部商品流通的总额中占百分之九八·四。私营商业在一九四七年占着全部商品流通总额的百分之五六·九的，现在仅占百分之一·六。
    工业、农业、贸易和整个经济的大力发展，保证了劳动人民物质和文化水平的不断改善。一九五一年人民的收入比一九五○年增加了百分之三十，今年将比一九五一年再增加百分之十九。今年所进行的货币改革以及两次降低食物与工业品价格标志着这些成就。
    保加利亚的文化事业，在季米特洛夫宪法的旗帜下也日益巩固和繁荣。小学、中学、大学、科学研究机构的数目不断增加。它们紧紧遵循着世界最进步和高尚的科学——苏联科学的成就与经验而发展。
    在苏联兄弟般的帮助和与世界爱好和平人民的合作下，保加利亚取得了和平的社会主义发展，站在巴尔干保卫和平的前列。季米特洛夫宪法反映出保加利亚人民自由幸福生活以及为社会主义和与各国友好而斗争的坚决意志。
