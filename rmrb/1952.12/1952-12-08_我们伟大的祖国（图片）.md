    Our Great Motherland
    This is a corner of the newly opened "People's Park" in Shanghai. Before liberation, imperialists built gambling dens here to exploit the blood and sweat of our people; now it has become a paradise for the people of Shanghai. Many children of working people are playing here with windmills.
