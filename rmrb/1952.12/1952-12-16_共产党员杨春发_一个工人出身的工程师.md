    Communist Party Member Yang Chunfa
    —An Engineer from a Worker Background
    Yu Ping
    Comrade Yang Chunfa, a member of the Communist Party, was just an ordinary worker with four years of schooling before liberation. Now he is a drilling engineer in the Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau.
    In the past few years, under the education and cultivation of the Party, Comrade Yang Chunfa has recognized the position of drilling work in the country's economic construction, and he also clearly knows that only by rapidly discovering underground resources can we adapt to the development of the country's economic construction. Therefore, in his work, he brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, studied and promoted advanced Soviet experience, improved the technical management of the drilling industry, created many experiences, and also wrote books such as "Introduction to Drilling Engineering," which trained more than 800 drilling technical personnel for the country.
    The efficiency of his drilling work has increased twofold this year compared with 1950 and doubled compared with 1951, increasing the overall progress of the year's projects by 63 percent and reducing costs by 61.8 percent. From January to now this year, he has saved the country 15,000 tons of grain in wealth.
    Since August 1950, when he was promoted from an ordinary drilling worker to an engineer, he has set an example for the workers, making everyone convinced that as long as they are willing to study politics hard and study business technology, an ordinary worker can become an engineer. Comrade Yang Chunfa is now an engineer with rich practical experience and a good understanding of advanced drilling technology theory.
    Learning Advanced Soviet Experience to Improve Mechanical Equipment
    The innovations and creations of Comrade Yang Chunfa in drilling work are inseparable from his serious study of advanced Soviet experience. Comrade Yang Chunfa made great efforts to study how to improve the efficiency of drilling rigs very early on, but without a satisfactory result.
    One day in March 1951, a Soviet expert arrived in Changchun, and Yang Chunfa met with the Soviet expert. In the conversation, the Soviet expert raised three questions related to drilling work: (1) To improve efficiency, the rotation speed of the drilling rig must be increased; (2) To ensure the quality of the borehole wall, more drill bits must be given; (3) The issue of safety facilities for drilling the ground. According to the instructions of the Soviet expert, Comrade Yang Chunfa conducted an experiment on the spot. He increased the mechanical rotation speed from 100 revolutions per minute to 140 to 180 revolutions per minute, and the drilling efficiency increased by 30 to 50 percent accordingly. This experiment paved the way for Comrade Yang Chunfa to study how to improve drilling efficiency and laid the foundation for the renovation of old machines. From then on, his confidence in research became even higher.
    He began drilling on clay, and the leadership specially allocated a machine to him to support his experimental work. Later, he also succeeded in conducting experiments on rocks. However, at that time, the increase in mechanical rotation speed was limited to the use of Soviet drilling rigs, which were equipped with speed regulating boxes. At that time, most of the drilling work used old machines, which did not have speed regulating equipment, so the efficiency of the entire drilling operation could not be improved. When he encountered this problem, he conducted research and proposed a method to improve old machines by enlarging the machine's drive wheel and reducing the driven wheel to increase the rotational efficiency of the old machine. The actual experimental results increased the old machine from 100 revolutions per minute to 180 to 198 revolutions per minute. After this experiment was successful, it was promoted in all drilling teams belonging to the company. At present, all old machines in the company that used to rotate from 60 to 100 revolutions per minute have been increased to 240 to 280 revolutions per minute, with the highest reaching 300 revolutions, an average increase of 180 revolutions, greatly improving the rotational efficiency of the old machines.
    Promote the One-Time Drill Bit Supply Method to Improve Drilling Efficiency
    While Comrade Yang Chunfa brought into play the efficiency of the machines, new problems arose: Supplying drill bits was very time-consuming, the wear rate of drilling tools was relatively high, and the quality of the borehole wall was poor. Therefore, he studied how to shorten production interruption time (non-drilling time), how to exert more efficient performance of the machines, reduce the wear of drilling tools, and improve the quality of the borehole wall. According to the Soviet expert's suggestion of giving more drill bits to ensure the increase of borehole wall gaps and improve drilling efficiency, he personally went deep into the site to promote the method of giving more drill bits, which resulted in the following: 1. The efficiency of drilling increased from 0.5 meters per day to more than 1 meter; 2. The core extraction rate greatly increased, and rocks of 6.5 to 7 degrees can be extracted 100%; 3. Shorten auxiliary working hours and improve the actual operating time of the machines; 4. Ensure the quality of drilling, and the extracted cores are all over 1 meter; 5. Prevented drilling tool failures during drilling. Currently, all teams in the company are implementing this method.
    Do a Good Job in Safety Work
    This spring, there were relatively more mechanical and personal accidents at the drilling sites. Comrade Yang Chunfa discovered this problem and, according to the instructions of Soviet experts, went deep into the site to understand the causes of various accidents. When analyzing the causes of accidents, he first proposed that "no matter how big or small an accident is, it is a disaster at work," and pointed out the cunningness of accidents. He said, "Accidents are not only fierce and cruel, but also best at exploiting loopholes. A little carelessness at work will be harmed by it." In order to prevent accidents from happening, on the one hand, he educated workers to learn technology and establish a responsibility system; on the other hand, he investigated, analyzed, and summarized the accidents that occurred in various teams of the drilling company, and wrote a booklet entitled "How to Prevent Accidents," which was distributed to various teams as materials for technical safety publicity and education for workers. He also personally took the materials to the site to explain to the workers. Before learning "How to Prevent Accidents," the Shizuizi Engineering Team had a total of ten personal injury accidents (one death, two serious injuries, and seven minor injuries) and a total of thirteen mechanical accidents (six major and seven general). After learning "How to Prevent Accidents," this situation was reversed. Personal injury accidents and mechanical accidents were either eliminated or reduced. These achievements are inseparable from Comrade Yang Chunfa's creations.
    Cultivating Reserve Forces
    One person's strength is limited. To accelerate the country's industrialization and quickly discover underground resources, there must be a large number of skilled drilling technicians. Under the education of the Party, Comrade Yang Chunfa firmly remembered the task given to him by the Party. In addition to actively studying technology and learning advanced Soviet technical theory in his work, he also gave workers two hours of technical classes every day in his spare time, regarding this work as the most glorious task. Not only that, but he also paid close attention to the training of apprentices by other veteran technicians. When giving technical classes to apprentices, he listened to the apprentices' reflections on learning technology at work and discovered that veteran technicians had the ideas of "unwilling to take apprentices" and "teaching apprentices to starve the master." At this time, Comrade Yang Chunfa immediately convened meetings of veteran workers to change the veteran technicians' unwillingness to take apprentices. Some veteran workers even established a system at the veteran technician meetings, which greatly improved the apprentices' enthusiasm for learning technology.
    In the past three years, Comrade Yang Chunfa has trained and cultivated more than 800 drilling technicians in practical work and in training courses held by the state. These people have now become the backbone of drilling work and are distributed in the work positions of Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals and Central South, Southwest, Northwest, coal, and iron mines. Currently, Comrade Yang Chunfa is also working as a teacher in a school of 3,000 technicians, preparing talents for large-scale economic construction.
    In order to introduce advanced working methods in drilling work, his own 19 years of practical drilling experience, and the drilling experience, systems, and advanced working methods he has learned in the past three years, he has compiled books such as "Introduction to Trial Drilling Engineering" and "Compilation of Drilling Management," which have been published by Northeast Industrial Publishing House. In addition, there are also several types of lectures on drilling quality issues, how to prevent accidents, preliminary summary of rapid drilling, lectures on new drilling rigs, and lectures on yellow mud slurry. The books he compiled are rich in content, easy for workers to understand, and have also played a significant role in drilling work.
    Difficulties Cannot Stop the Road to Progress
    Comrade Yang Chunfa's work in promoting advanced experience was not smooth sailing. He encountered many difficult problems, but he always believed that no matter how difficult the work is, as long as you carefully study and analyze it, there is no problem that cannot be solved. Many difficult problems have been gradually overcome under this spirit. For example, when he promoted the "one-time supply of drill bits" method, many workers were unwilling to accept this working method because they were afraid of malfunctions. Some workers said, "Eating too much will cause stomach problems, let alone machines." Some people reluctantly implemented it, but when the drill pipe was worn and malfunctioned, they complained that it was "the result of giving too many drill bits." When Comrade Yang Chunfa encountered these problems, he conducted research based on the opinions reflected by the workers until he found the cause and explained it to the workers.

    共产党员杨春发
    —一个工人出身的工程师
    俞平
    共产党员杨春发同志，在解放前只是一个念过四年书的普通工人。现在是东北有色金属管理局的钻探工程师。
    几年来，杨春发同志，在党的教育培养之下，认识到钻探工作在国家经济建设上的地位，也清楚地知道：只有迅速地发现地下资源才能适应国家经济建设的发展。因此，他在工作中发挥了工人阶级的积极性和创造性，学习与推广了苏联先进经验，改进了钻探事业的技术管理，创造了许多经验，还编写了“钻探工程概论”等书籍，为国家培养了八百余名钻探技术人材。
    他的钻探工作的效率，今年比一九五○年提高了两倍，比一九五一年提高了一倍，使全年的工程总进度提高了百分之六十三，降低成本百分之六十一点八。今年一月到现在，为国家节省了一万五千吨粮食的财富。
    从一九五○年八月他从一个普通的钻探工人被提拔为工程师以来，他给工人树立了一个榜样，使大家确信，只要肯努力学习政治，钻研业务技术，一个普通工人是可以当工程师的。杨春发同志现在已经是一个具有丰富的实际工作经验，懂得较高的钻探技术理论的工程师了。
    学习苏联先进经验改进机械设备
    杨春发同志在钻探工作上的革新和创造，是和他认真学习苏联先进经验分不开的。杨春发同志为了提高钻机的效率，很早就尽了很大的力量钻研，但是没有一个圆满的结果。
    一九五一年三月的一天，一位苏联专家到了长春，杨春发和这位苏联专家会了面。在谈话中，苏联专家提出了有关钻探工作的三个问题：（一）提高效率必须提高钻机转数；（二）保证井壁质量一定要多给钻粒；（三）钻地的保安设施问题。杨春发同志根据苏联专家的指示，当场进行了试验。他把机械回转速度，由每分钟一百转，提高到一百四十转至一百八十转，钻进效率随之提高了百分之三十至百分之五十。这次的试验给杨春发同志研究提高钻探效率开辟了道路，为旧机器的改进工作打下了基础，从此，他研究的信心更高了。
    他开始在粘土上钻进，领导方面为了支持他的试验工作，就专门给他拨出一台机器，后来，他在岩石上进行试验也成功了。但是，当时提高机械转数，只限于用在苏联的钻机上，苏联的钻机上装设有调速箱。当时在钻探工作中大部都是使用旧机器，这种机器没有调速设备，因而整个钻探的效率还是提不高。他碰到了这个问题，就进行了研究，提出了改进旧机器的方法，将机器的主动轮扩大，缩小被动轮，提高旧机器的回转效率。实际试验的结果，使旧机器由每分钟一百转，提高到一百八十转至一百九十八转，在这次试验成功之后，即在全公司所属钻探队中推广。目前，全公司所有的由过去每分钟六十转到一百转的旧机器，都提高到二百四十转到二百八十转，最高的达到三百转，平均提高了一百八十转，大大地发挥了旧机器的回转效率。
    推广一次钻粒补给法，提高钻进效率
    在杨春发同志发挥了机器效率的同时，又发生了新问题：补给钻粒浪费时间很大，钻具的磨损率也比较高，井壁质量不好；于是，他研究如何缩短生产中断时间（非钻进时间），如何发挥机器的更高效能和减少钻具的磨损，提高井壁质量。根据苏联专家提出的多给钻粒，保证井壁的空隙增大和提高钻进效率的意见，他亲自深入到现场去，推广多给钻粒的方法，获得如下的结果：一、钻进的效率；由日进零点五公尺，提高到一公尺以上；二、岩心采取率大大的提高，六点五度到七度的岩石，可采取百分之百；三、缩短补助工时，提高机器的实际开动时间；四、保证了钻探的质量，采取出的岩心都是在一公尺以上；五、防止了钻进中钻具的故障。目前全公司各队都实行这个方法。
    作好保安工作
    今年的春季各钻探现场的机械、人身等事故发生的比较多。杨春发同志发现了这问题，又根据苏联专家的指示，深入到现场了解各种事故发生的原因。他在分析事故发生的原因时，首先提出“不论大小事故，都是工作上的祸害”，并且指出事故的狡猾性。他说：“事故不仅凶恶残忍，而且还最会钻空子，工作上稍一不谨慎，就会受到它的侵害”。为了防止事故的发生，他一方面教育工人学习技术，建立责任制；另一方面，把钻探公司各队发生的事故，经过了调查分析、总结，写出了一本“如何防止事故”的小册子，发到各队，作为向工人进行技术安全宣传教育的材料。他并且亲自拿着材料到现场给工人讲解。石嘴子工程队在没有学习“如何防止事故”之前，发生了人身死亡事故共十次（死亡一人，重伤二人，轻伤七人），机械事故共十三次（重大六次，一般七次），学习了“如何防止事故”之后，即扭转了这种局面，人身伤亡事故和机械事故有的消灭了，有的减少了。这些成绩是与杨春发同志的创著分不开的。
    培养后备力量
    一个人的力量是有限的，要加速祖国的工业化，迅速发现地下资源，必须要有大量熟练的钻探技工。杨春发同志在党的教育下牢牢地记住了党所给他的任务，在工作中除积极钻研技术，学习苏联的先进技术理论之外，每天在业余时间给工人讲二小时技术课，把这一个工作看作是最光荣的任务。不仅如此，他还很注意其他老技术工培养徒工情况。在给徒工讲技术课时，听取徒工在工作中学习技术的反映，发现老技工有“不愿带徒弟”和“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”的思想，这时杨春发同志即召集老工人开会，转变了老技工不愿带徒弟的思想。有的老工友在老技工会上订出了制度，大大提高了徒工学技术的积极性。
    三年来，杨春发同志在实际工作中及国家举办的训练班中，共训练和培养钻探技工八百余名，这些人在目前已成为钻探工作中的骨干。散布在东北有色金属及中南、西南、西北、煤、铁矿的工作岗位上。目前杨春发同志又在三千技工的学校里担任教师，为大规模经济建设准备人材。
    为了介绍钻探工作中的先进工作方法，自己十九年的实际钻探工作经验及近三年来所体会到的钻探经验，制度，及先进工作方法，编写了“试钻工程概论”、“钻探管理汇编”等书籍，这些书已由东北工业出版社出版。另外还有钻探质量问题，如何防止事故，快速钻进初步总结，新式钻机讲义黄泥浆讲义等数种。他所编写的书籍内容丰富，工人易懂，对钻探工作也起了很大作用。
    困难阻挡不住前进的道路
    杨春发同志在推广先进经验的工作中，不是一帆风顺的，他曾遇到了许多的困难问题，但是，他始终相信：无论工作怎么困难，只要认真地研究、分析，没有不能解决的问题。很多困难问题，就在这样的精神下逐渐被克服了。如他在推广“一次补给钻粒”法时，很多工人不愿意接受这个工作方法，怕出故障，有的工人说：“人吃饭吃多了，还得胃病，何况是机器。”也有的人勉强执行了，但是当钻管磨坏发生故障时，就埋怨是“多给钻粒的结果。”杨春发同志遇到了这些问题，就根据工人所反映的意见，进行研究，直到找出了原因向工人讲明白。
