Advanced Installation Worker Zhang Jiaming Grows Up in Construction
    Wei Jun
    There is a training class in Anshan, specializing in training technical workers to build modern factories. In this training class, young fitter Zhang Jiaming is learning advanced installation methods for new types of machines. Like other workers, he has never seen many of these machines, and some he has never even heard of.
    Three months later, he arrived at the 0230 construction site. An automated factory was being built here, and the scale, complexity, and precision of the equipment were astounding. The deepest part of the foundation required pouring ten meters of concrete, as high as a two-story building. There were tens of thousands of anchor bolts just to secure the machines, with each large machine requiring eight to ten anchor bolts weighing 1.2 tons. Electricity, water, wind, heating, gas, were all delivered to the factory building through underground pipelines... Zhang Jiaming thought of all this, recalling when the Japanese just surrendered in 1945, a Japanese section chief publicly said to the workers at a meeting: "We're leaving, and Anshan Iron and Steel will be planting sorghum in three years!" But today, in Anshan, he faced a massive construction site—a future new factory! He understood that a new life had arrived, and the country's large-scale economic construction had begun here first. The fact that he was about to participate in the construction of the new factory excited him so much that it seemed the blood in his whole body was flowing faster.
    One day, the workers in Zhang Jiaming's group were cleaning the worktable behind the sizing machine. Zhang Jiaming noticed that the "Babbitt" pad on the oil hole was rusty and wanted to replace it, but he couldn't decide on his own. It happened that Soviet expert Chernyesky came to the site. He wanted to talk to the expert, but he was a little timid and dared not approach him. But thinking that if the "Babbitt" pad was rusty, the mixed water and oil would drip into the ball bearings, and the precise paint beads in the roller would be damaged, he immediately rushed forward, grabbed Chernyesky's hand, and pulled him to the machine to point it out, turning around to tell the translator, "Translate it in detail." As a result, the expert agreed to replace the "Babbitt" pad and smiled as he asked him why he was so careful. He replied, "I'll be responsible after it starts running!"
    As soon as the pre-installation work was completed, Zhang Jiaming's group came to install the anchor bolts. Speaking of installing anchor bolts, it's a century-long plan that requires extreme precision. They were fixing the position of the bolts according to the Soviet advanced installation method, and then pouring concrete at the bottom. A slight deviation in this work would prevent the machine from being installed; a slow installation would affect the pouring of concrete, so it really needed to be done quickly and well. In the past, there had been such a thing: the height of the anchor bolts protruding from the ground was not accurate, so they had to heat the ones that were too short to pull them up, and cut off a section of the ones that were too high. The Soviet experts shook their heads when they saw this, saying that this method was not good. Now there were tens of thousands of anchor bolts on the entire construction site, and it was impossible to keep up with the pace using only three or four measuring instruments. So, they installed two elevation rods on both sides, pulled a steel wire, measured the height of one bolt, and then the elevation of all the bolts on this steel wire could be determined. In the future, if the height of one anchor bolt was found to be合格 (qualified), the rest would all be 合格 (qualified). After the elevation problem was solved, there was another difficulty: to install the anchor bolts, a center line had to be drawn. But this drawing was problematic because hundreds and thousands of center lines crisscrossed, making people feel like they were in a spider web and unable to operate. Zhang Jiaming came up with a solution: he erected iron rods at both ends of a long row of machine positions, welded iron bars in the middle, measured the distance between the anchor bolts with a ruler, divided the iron bars into sections, and then hung a line. After all the anchor bolts on this line were installed, the center line was moved to the next section of the iron bar. In this way, it was both 省事 (labor-saving) and the position of the anchor bolts was accurate. Zhang Jiaming also divided the work into eight processes and implemented a cyclical flow operation. He first led everyone to look at the blueprints, studied the blueprints thoroughly, and then those who should hang center lines hung the lines, those who should find the elevation found the elevation, and those who should transport materials transported the materials. Whether they were skilled workers or apprentices, everyone knew what they were doing and how to do it, and each process had a dedicated person responsible for inspection. From then on, the project progressed very quickly, and one worker could install two anchor bolts, reaching the Soviet level, and the quality was improved to over 98%.
    The anchor bolts were successfully installed without affecting the pouring of concrete. According to the standard, the tolerance of the bottom foot of the anchor bolts should not exceed 5 millimeters, the tolerance above should not exceed 1 millimeter, and the height should not differ by more than 3 millimeters, all meeting the requirements.
    However, the work was becoming more and more complicated, and Zhang Jiaming and his team took over the installation of the sizing machine. This required extreme precision and accuracy. Soviet expert Chernyesky personally found the center line of the sizing machine, found half of it and then taught Zhang Jiaming to find it. He was worried during the installation and would come to check every now and then. He said to Zhang Jiaming, "China is not just building one such automated factory. In the future, it will build ten, dozens, or even countless, so you need to study hard so that you can meet the needs of the work in the future." The expert's words powerfully touched Zhang Jiaming's heart. He thought: Soviet experts are working hard to help us build factories, and the wealth produced in the future is not for Comrade Chernyesky to send back home, but for the Chinese people to enjoy! Isn't this the great spirit of internationalism! If we don't study hard, how can we be worthy of the motherland and the experts. He also thought of the realization of the country's industrialization, with countless modern factories producing all kinds of products for the people. What a magnificent future this is! But empty talk won't lead to China's industrialization, and modern factories won't appear. We must master the advanced technology of building modern factories! He became even more determined.
    There are four sliding plates on the sizing machine, the two on the north side are 80 millimeters higher than those on the south side. According to the requirements of the Soviet technical standards, there cannot be a 道 (measure word) of tolerance between them. A 道 (measure word) is one-seventh of a hair. In other words, tolerances finer than a hair are not allowed. Zhang Jiaming used a template and worked for five and a half days, leveling them one by one. Leveling two sliding plates of the same height is easy, but it is very difficult to be accurate to a single 道 (measure word) between two sliding plates that are 80 millimeters apart. Zhang Jiaming spent a lot of effort to achieve a tolerance of two 道 (measure word). Comrade Chernyesky came to help with the acceptance inspection, and the first question he asked was, "How much difference is there?" Zhang Jiaming replied, "Two 道 (measure word)." "No good," Chernyesky said to him solemnly, "The sizing machine is the center of the automated machine, like the heart of the human body. A person can still live if they lose an arm or a leg, but if the heart is damaged, it won't work." After saying this, he pulled him to look at the blueprints together, explaining that an 80-millimeter thousandth pad should be placed on the sliding plate, and then a flat ruler and level should be used to level it, so that the tolerance could be as small as a few "twists." (Note: One twist is one-seventieth of a hair). Chernyesky also instructed Zhang Jiaming that the center line on the machine should be a long line. Zhang Jiaming said that if the line is too long, it would swing in the wind, affecting the precision. Chernyesky told him again that the plumb bob could be placed in an oil box to stabilize it. Finally, he asked, "When will it be finished?" Zhang Jiaming said, "A day and a half."
    "Can you finish it?" Because the precision requirements were too high, the expert was worried and asked again. "Yes!" Zhang Jiaming answered very simply and confidently.
    On time, Comrade Chernyesky came to the machine in person with the blueprints. After a detailed inspection, he found that the tolerance had reached zero degrees, with not a single "twist" of difference! He signed his name with satisfaction and was very happy to have such a diligent and capable good student.
    Zhang Jiaming entered Anshan Iron and Steel Company as an apprentice at the age of twelve, cooking meals for his master, and it has been fifteen years since then. All the things he learned in the long fifteen years did not amount to as much as he learned in the eight months at the 0230 construction site. In eight months, he mastered some complex and precise technologies for building modern automated factories, learned to use some precise scientific tools, and became an advanced installation worker. Not only did he improve rapidly, but the enthusiasm for building the motherland and the guidance of Soviet experts also greatly improved the technology of other workers in the team. In eight months, three workers were promoted to team leaders, and two apprentices were promoted to technicians. This is just the beginning. Next year, Zhang Jiaming and his partners will learn to master more complex technologies in the upsurge of large-scale economic construction and play a backbone role in building huge modern factories for the motherland.

    在建设中成长起来的先进安装工人张甲明
    维君
    鞍山有个训练班，专门培养修建近代化工厂的技术工人。在这个训练班里，青年钳工张甲明学习着新型机器的先进安装方法。他和其他工人一样，有许多机器是从来不曾见过，甚至连听也没有听见过的。
    三个月后，他到了○二三○工地。这里在修建一座自动化工厂，规模的巨大与设备的复杂、精密都是惊人的。地基最深的地方要浇十公尺厚的混凝土，赶上二层楼房那样高。光是固定机器的地脚螺丝就有上万个，大机器上每台得用八个到十个重一吨二的地脚螺丝。电、水、风、暖气、瓦斯都由地下管道送到厂房……。张甲明想到这些，回想起一九四五年日本人刚投降时，有个日本科长，公开在大会上向工人说：“我们走了，鞍钢三年后得种高粱！”而今天，在鞍钢，他面对着的是庞大的建筑工地——一个未来的新工厂！他明白新的生活已经来临，祖国的大规模经济建设首先在这儿开始了。即将参与新工厂的建设这一事实，使他兴奋得似乎全身血液都加速地流动起来。
    一天，张甲明小组的工人正在清洗整径机后工作台，张甲明发现油眼上的“巴金”垫已经上锈，想要换一个，但不能擅自决定。恰好苏联专家契尔聂斯基到现场来了，他想和专家谈，又有些怯生不敢接近他；但想到“巴金”垫锈了，水油混合滴到滚珠里，辊里精密的漆珠就得损坏，他马上抢上前去握住契尔聂斯基的手，把他拉到机器旁边指给他看，回身又对翻译说：“你翻译得详细点。”结果专家同意了换“巴金”垫，同时笑着问他为什么这样细心？他答道：“开车后，我要负责任的！”
    预安装的工程一完，张甲明小组便来安装地脚螺丝。提起安装地脚螺丝，真是百年大计，要求十分精密。他们是按照苏联先进安装法，把螺丝位置固定后，下部浇灌混凝土。这项工作稍有偏差，机器便安装不上；安装得慢了，就影响混凝土的浇灌，真是需要又快又好。过去曾经有过这样的事：地脚螺丝露出地面的高度不精确，结果只好把安得矮的烧红了拔高些，把露得高的截去一段，苏联专家看到后直摇头说这办法不好。现在全工地上万个地脚螺丝，靠三、四台测量仪器依次测量，当然赶不上趟。于是他们就在两边安上两根标高棍，拉上钢丝，测定一个螺丝的高度，然后所有位在这一钢丝线上的螺丝的标高便都能确定，将来检查一个地脚螺丝的高度合格，其余的也就全能合格了。标高问题解决了，又有一个难题，安地脚螺丝要拉中心线，这一拉不要紧，成百成千的中心线纵横交错，人宛如在蜘蛛网中，无法操作。张甲明想了一个办法：在一长列机器位置的两端竖上铁棍，中间焊上铁筋，用标尺量好地脚螺丝间的距离，在铁筋上分好段，然后挂上一道线，等所有位在这道线上的地脚螺丝安完后，再把中心线移至铁筋的下一段上，如此，既省事，地脚螺丝的位置又精确。张甲明又把工作分成八道工序，实行循环流水作业。他先领着大家看图纸，把图纸研究透彻后，于是该挂中心线的挂线，该找标高的找标高，该运料的运料，不论技工、徒工，每人都知道自己干什么和怎么干，每道工序都有专人负责检查。从此，工程进展得很快，一个工能安两个地脚螺丝，达到苏联的水平，质量提高到百分之九十八以上。
    地脚螺丝胜利地安装完毕，没有影响混凝土的浇灌。按标准，地脚螺丝的底脚公差不超过五粍，上面的公差不超过一粍，高度不差三粍，全部合乎要求。
    但是，工作越来越不简单，张甲明和他的小组又接手安装整径机。这需要极度精密和准确。苏联专家契尔聂斯基亲自找整径机的中心线，找了一半又教张甲明找，安装时放心不下，隔一会儿就跑来看看。他对张甲明讲：“中国不是修一个这样的自动化工厂，将来要修十个、几十个以至无数个，你们需要好好学习，将来才能赶上工作的需要。”专家的话一字一句有力地打动着张甲明的心。他想：苏联专家辛辛苦苦帮我们修起工厂，将来生产的财富也不是给契尔聂斯基同志寄回家去，还不是中国人民享用！这不就是伟大的国际主义精神么！我们不努力学习，怎么对得起祖国，对得起专家。他又想起祖国工业化的实现，无数近代化大工厂将为人民生产出各式各样的产品，这是多么壮丽的未来！但是，空口说白话，中国不会工业化，近代化工厂也不会出现，得掌握修建近代化工厂的先进技术！他下了更大的决心。
    整径机上有四块滑板，北边的两块比南边的高八十粍，按苏联技术标准的要求，它们之间不能有一道公差。一道是一根头发的七分之一。换句话说，比头发还细的公差都不允许有。张甲明利用样板干了五天半，一块块找平。两块同样高的滑板之间找平是容易的，但两块相差八十粍的滑板之间要精确到一道不差却很困难。张甲明费了好大力气，才达到公差二道。契尔聂斯基同志来帮助验收，第一句就问：“差多少？”张甲明答道；“差二道”。“不行”，契尔聂斯基郑重地对他说：“整径机是自动化机器的中心，犹如人体的心脏。人失掉了胳膊或腿还可以活下去，弄坏了心脏就不行了。”说罢，就拉他一起看图纸，说明要用八十粍千分垫放在滑板上，再放上平尺和水平仪来找平，公差就可以小到几“扭”。（注：一扭为一根头发的七十分之一）契尔聂斯基又指示张甲明，机器上的中心线应挂长线。张甲明说线长了怕风一吹晃荡，影响精密度。契尔聂斯基又告诉他，线锤可放在油盒里稳住。最后他问：“什么时候能完？”张甲明说：“一天半。”
    “能完吗？”因为精密度要求过高，专家不放心，特地再问一句。“能！”张甲明回答得很干脆，很自信。
    到期，契尔聂斯基同志拿着图纸亲自到机器旁验看，经过详详细细的检查，发现公差竟达到零度，
    一“扭”都不差！他满意地签了字，很高兴有这样
    一位勤勉、能干的好学生。
    张甲明从十二岁进鞍山钢铁公司当学徒，给师傅烤饭盒，到现在已有十五年了。十五年的漫长岁月中他全部学到的东西加起来不及他到○二三○工地八个月所学的多。八个月中，他掌握了修建近代化自动工厂的某些复杂、精密的技术，学会了使用某些精密的科学的工具，成为一个先进的安装工人。不仅他进步得飞快，建设祖国的热诚与苏联专家的教导同样也使小组里其他工人技术上大步地提高。八个月中，有三个工人被提升做组长，两个徒工升为技工。这还仅仅是开始，明年，张甲明和他的伙伴们将在大规模经济建设的高潮中学会掌握更复杂的技术，在为祖国修建巨大近代化工厂中起骨干作用。
