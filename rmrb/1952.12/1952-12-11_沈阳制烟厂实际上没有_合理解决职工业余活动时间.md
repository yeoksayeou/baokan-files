    Shenyang Cigarette Factory Has Not Actually
    Reasonably Solved the Problem of Employees' After-Work Activity Time
    Editor: The Shenyang Cigarette Factory has, on paper in its "schedule," complied with the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on reasonably allocating employees' after-work activity time, but the actual situation is not like this.
    The situation of excessively long after-work activity time for employees in the factory started in May of this year. Although it was criticized by workers in the factory and the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, it has not been improved. In July, in order to convey the instructions of the Northeast Monopoly Bureau and to study the specific work of the factory, the factory held two large-scale meetings of all employees during the week's after-work activity time, with reports from the director and deputy director, each lasting three hours. Group discussions were held twice, each lasting more than two and a half hours. A major cleaning was carried out once, taking up two hours. Before the entertainment activities on Saturday night, a technical research meeting had to be held. In addition to regular cultural studies, the workers' after-work activity time this week was more than twenty hours (the regulations of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulate that it should not exceed two hours per day, and meetings or classes should be avoided as much as possible on Sundays). Similar situations are frequently encountered in the factory.
    The meetings held by the factory cadres are even more frequent. Song Jie, the secretary of the Youth League branch of the Medium Packaging Department, reflected: "The leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League in our workshop have to go to bed at eleven o'clock every night. We have to participate in and grasp the workers' study or discussion; after the meeting, we have to get together for a quick discussion, and we have to hold six quick discussion meetings a week. Sometimes we have to hold Party or Youth League branch committees on Sundays. Because the meetings are all squeezed together, there is no other time to hold them except on Sundays."
    It is worth noting that this situation of too many meetings and too long meeting times has not yet attracted the attention of the factory's leading cadres. Workers Li Guilan, Wu Yaozhi, Huang Yulan, and others said: "The suggestions made last time have not been changed! This week (referring to November 17th to 22nd) there are meetings every day. On Monday, we discussed the Red Flag competition, on Tuesday we took a Party class, on Wednesday it was still a Party class, on Thursday we did a major cleaning, and on Friday we listened to a two-and-a-half-hour current affairs report, and on Saturday we discussed this report. Not only that, but there is only one hour of rest at noon every day, and we have to hold a joint meeting of group leaders or a group meeting. If there is no meeting, we have to work overtime." This shows the serious situation of excessively long after-work activity time for employees in the factory.
    What difficulties does this cause for employees? Take Chen Suyun as an example: her home is in Beizhan, which is eight li away from the factory. There is only one eight-year-old child at home. The factory meetings end at nine o'clock in the evening. By the time she gets home, it's ten o'clock. By the time she cooks, eats, and cleans up the furniture, it's always around twelve o'clock. The next day, she has to get up at five o'clock to cook. In this way, she can only sleep for five hours a night. Such a situation is not isolated among the employees of the factory.
    The main reason for the excessively long after-work activity time for employees in the factory is that the factory's leading cadres lack a mass viewpoint and do not care about the workers' hardships. Just citing the following fact fully illustrates this problem. On a certain night in July of this year, the factory held a general meeting of all employees, with the factory director giving a report on the patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign. Two-thirds of the workers present had not eaten (the factory director himself was naturally full). When the meeting reached eight o'clock, the workers were so hungry that they couldn't bear it any longer, and some said: "We haven't eaten yet, hurry up!" In response to the workers' reasonable request, the factory director replied sternly: "Who said they're hungry? Whoever is hungry raise your hand! Come up on the stage!" The meeting still lasted until after nine o'clock. What is particularly intolerable is that even now, the factory workers still often listen to reports on an empty stomach. The factory director always emphasizes that "the workers' consciousness is low, and we need to hold more meetings and educate them more in order to complete the production tasks." It is not difficult to understand: what good effect can such "report meetings" have!
    Since the superior cadres are like this, individual lower-level cadres naturally follow suit. Workshop Director Gan Liping eats her own meal before the meeting. The workers asked her: "Can we eat first too?" But this director said, "No! It's not time yet." But the factory leaders have not noticed the problem that workers cannot eat after the meeting. For example, in August, the Third Workshop held a general meeting, and one-third of the workers did not eat. When the meeting was over, the canteen refused to sell food. The reason is that the factory stipulated that meals would not be served after seven o'clock.
    What kind of bad consequences will the factory's failure to give workers reasonable rest time cause? What harm will it bring to the country? Is it beneficial to production? Let the following figures answer this question:
    The illness rate of the factory workers was 4.8% in October and rose to 5.4% in November. The total number of workers in the fifth group of the medium packaging department of the Third Workshop is eighty, and on average there are eleven sick leaves every day, and four or five people go to see a doctor sporadically every day. The total production task of the Third Workshop in November was 9,000 boxes, and 7,560 boxes should have been completed by the 24th, but only 7,178 boxes were actually completed.

### 沈阳制烟厂实际上没有  合理解决职工业余活动时间

    沈阳制烟厂实际上没有
    合理解决职工业余活动时间
    编辑同志：沈阳制烟厂职工业余活动时间在“时间表”上是作到了符合中共沈阳市委关于合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定的，但实际情况却不是这样。
    该厂职工业余活动时间过长的情形是从今年五月开始的，后来虽经该厂工人及沈阳市总工会提出了批评，但迄未改进。该厂在七月间为了传达东北专卖总局的指示和结合研究该厂的具体工作，在一周的业余活动时间中便召开两次全厂性的大会，分别由正副厂长做报告，每次时间均长达三小时，小组讨论两次，每次均超过两小时半。清洁大扫除一次，占去了两小时。星期六晚上在进行文娱活动以前还要开一次技术研究会。加上正规的文化学习，这个星期工人的业余活动时间在二十小时以上（中共沈阳市委的规定是每天不得超过两小时，星期日应尽量避免开会或上课）。类似这样的情形在该厂是经常遇到的。
    该厂干部开的会就更多了。中包部青年团支部书记宋杰就反映：“我们车间的党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部哪天都得晚上十一点才能睡觉。工人学习或讨论，我们得参加掌握；会后我们得碰碰头，一周得开六个碰头会。有的星期日还得开党或青年团的支部委员会。因为会都挤在一起，不在星期日开就再也没有时间。”
    值得注意的是这种开会过多、时间过长的情形到现在还没有引起该厂领导干部的重视。该厂工人李桂兰、吴耀志、黄玉兰等都说：“上回提了意见也没有改呀！这个星期（指十一月十七日至二十二日）那天都有会，星期一讨论红旗竞赛，星期二上党课，星期三还是党课，星期四清洁大扫除，星期五听了两个半小时的时事报告，星期六讨论这个报告。不仅这样，每天中午只有一小时的休息时间，要吃饭还要开小组长联席会或小组会，不开会就要加点。”由此可见该厂职工业余活动时间过长的严重情形。
    这样，给职工造成哪些困难呢？拿陈素云来说吧：他家在北站，离厂里有八里路。家里只有一个八岁的孩子。晚上厂里开会开到九点钟才散会。她走到家里就得十点钟。等她做饭、吃饭、收拾好家具，总得十二点左右。第二天五点钟又得起来做饭。这样她一宿只能睡五个小时。像这样的情形在该厂的职工中并不是个别的。
    造成该厂职工业余活动时间过长的原因，最主要的是该厂领导干部十分缺乏群众观点，不关心工人的疾苦。只要举出下面这一件事实，便充分地说明这一问题。今年七月某一天的晚上，该厂开全体职工大会，由厂长作关于爱国增产节约竞赛运动的报告。在场的工人有三分之二没有吃饭（厂长自己自然是吃饱了饭的）。会议进行到八点钟时，工人饿得实在受不了，有的人便说：“还没有吃饭呢，快点吧！”对于工人这样合情合理的要求，厂长却疾声厉色地回答：“谁说饿？谁饿谁举手！站到台上来！”这个会还是开到九点多钟才结束。特别不能容忍的是一直到现在该厂工人还是经常饿着肚子听报告。厂长总是强调“工人觉悟低，要完成生产任务就得多开会多教育”。不难明白：这样的“报告会”能起什么好的效果呢！
    上级干部是这样，个别下级干部很自然地就向上看齐。车间主任甘丽萍在开会前自己先吃了饭。工人就问她：“我们也先吃饭行不行？”而这位主任却说“不行！未到点。”但该厂领导人却没有注意到工人开完会就吃不上饭的问题。如八月间三车间开大会，有三分之一的工人没有吃饭，等到开完会，食堂不肯卖饭了。原因是厂部规定超过七点就不开饭。
    该厂这样不给工人以合理的休息时间，会造成什么样的恶果呢？会给国家带来哪些损害呢？对生产有没有好处呢？让下面几个数字来回答这个问题吧：
    该厂工人的患病率十月份是百分之四点八，十一月份上升至百分之五点四。三车间中包第五大组工人总人数是八十人，平均每天有十一名病假，零星去看病的每天都有四、五人。该厂三车间十一月份生产总任务是九千箱，到二十四日应该完成七千五百六十箱，实际只完成七千一百七十八箱。
