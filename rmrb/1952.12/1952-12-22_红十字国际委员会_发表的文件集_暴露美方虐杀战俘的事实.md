    “International Committee of the Red Cross” Published Document Collection
    Exposes the Fact that the U.S. Side Abused and Killed Prisoners of War
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The crimes of the U.S. side violating the Geneva Convention by slaughtering and mistreating prisoners of war can also be confirmed from the document collection published by the U.S.'s loyal servant, the "International Committee of the Red Cross." According to a United Press dispatch from Geneva on the 15th, "The International Committee of the Red Cross" published a collection of documents regarding the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Korean War from January 1st to June 30th. United Press quoted materials published by the committee as saying: "The behaviors of the United Nations Command that violated the Geneva Convention include: in Camp No. 95 of Prisoner of War Camp No. 1 on Geoje Island in April of this year, American and South Korean guards shot and killed some prisoners of war; in Camp No. 10, concussion grenades were used to kill a sick prisoner in a hospital, and injure several other prisoners of war; and the sick prisoners in the three hospital camps were not given food."
    While painstakingly publishing these materials, the committee published a "reply" from the commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces invading Korea, Clark, to explain the above-mentioned atrocities. Clark could not deny that the U.S. side had used barbaric "concussion grenades" against unarmed prisoners of war, but shamelessly quibbled that "this is not a combat bomb." He also sophistically described these atrocities as "necessary" actions. But Clark's reply was so weak that he could not deny the facts of these killings and mistreatment of prisoners of war.

    “红十字国际委员会”发表的文件集
    暴露美方虐杀战俘的事实
    据新华社讯：美方违反日内瓦公约屠杀和虐待战俘的罪行，从美方的忠顺奴仆“红十字国际委员会”发表的文件集中也可以得到证实。据合众社日内瓦十五日电透露：“红十字国际委员会”刊印了一本关于红十字国际委员会和朝鲜战争从一月一日起到六月三十日之间的文件集。合众社引述该会发表的材料说：“联合国司令部违背日内瓦公约的行为包括：在今年四月巨济岛第一号战俘营的第九十五号营场中，美国和南朝鲜看守兵开枪击毙一些战俘；在十号营场中用震荡手榴弹杀害一名医院中的病俘，炸伤几名其他战俘；并不给三个病院营场中的病俘们的饮食。”
    该会在苦心地发表这些材料的同时，刊载了侵朝美军总司令克拉克的“答复”，来为上述暴行事件作解释。克拉克无法否认美方曾对手无寸铁的战俘使用了野蛮的“震荡手榴弹”，而无耻地用所谓“这不是作战炸弹”来进行诡辩。他又强词夺理地把这些暴行说成是“必要”的行为。但克拉克的答复却是如此无力，他无法否认这些屠杀和虐待战俘的事实。
