Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th:

    The Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, a state-owned enterprise under the Benxi Coal and Iron Company, has once again set new iron smelting records for medium-sized blast furnaces on November 24th and December 4th. The blast furnace volume required to produce one ton of iron was reduced to 0.598 on November 24th and further reduced to 0.578 on December 4th. In November, the plant overfulfilled the state plan by 8%, with the quality of pig iron reaching 99.86%.

    In August and September of this year, Blast Furnace No. X in the plant experienced three incidents of hanging (where the raw materials do not descend properly inside the furnace), resulting in low pig iron output and quality. In early October, the plant quickly resolved the hanging issue by implementing the steam blasting operation method proposed by Soviet iron smelting expert Afanasiev. Furthermore, starting November 17th, another furnace began using two blowers to supply air, increasing the airflow inside the furnace by approximately 10%. The further implementation of advanced Soviet operating methods such as high blast temperature, full airflow, and smooth material flow has enabled the plant to continuously set four new records during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Currently, the plant's workers are revising the plan and preparing to further launch competitions, learn more advanced Soviet experiences, and strive to complete this year's state production plan in full three days ahead of schedule.

    本溪炼铁厂再创中型高炉炼铁新纪录
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】国营本溪煤铁公司炼铁厂在十一月二十四日和十二月四日又连续创造了中型高炉的炼铁新纪录。每出一吨铁所需要的高炉容积，十一月二十四日降低到零点五九八；十二月四日降低到零点五七八。该厂十一月份超额完成了国家计划百分之八，生铁质量达到百分之九十九点八六。
    该厂某号高炉在今年八、九两月中曾连续发生过三次悬料（料在高炉内不往下落）事故，因而生铁的产量和质量很低。十月上旬，该厂由于推行了苏联炼铁专家阿法那西那夫提出的蒸汽鼓风操作法，悬料问题很快得到解决；另一炉又在十一月十七日开始由两台鼓风机合车送风，使高炉炉内的风量增加了百分之十左右。苏联先进的高风温、全风量、快料顺行等操作法的进一步贯彻实行，使该厂在“中苏友好月”中连续创造了四次新纪录。现在该厂职工正在修订计划，准备进一步发动竞赛，更好地学习苏联先进经验，争取提前三天全面完成今年的国家生产计划。
