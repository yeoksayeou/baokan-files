    With the World People's Peace Congress approaching, peace organizations in various countries are holding national peace conferences one after another, re-electing the leading bodies of the peace movement, collecting opinions from people of all walks of life to be submitted to the World People's Peace Congress, and selecting representatives to attend the Peace Congress.

    The delegation from Korea to the World People's Peace Congress departed from Pyongyang on November 20th to attend the congress in Vienna. The delegation consists of 20 members, headed by Han Sorya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and member of the World Peace Council, with Ki Sok-pok, Ro Jin-han, and Jeong Seong-eon as deputy heads, and Jeon Dong-hyuk as secretary-general.

    The German Conference for Promoting Mutual Understanding and Defending Peace opened in Berlin on November 28th. More than 4,000 representatives and guests from both East and West Germany, as well as many foreign guests, attended the conference. Professor Friedrich, Chairman of the German Peace Committee, presided over the opening ceremony. Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: "We demand that a pan-German conference with representatives from East and West Germany be held in accordance with the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. The conference must study all issues in dispute and discuss the preparations for pan-German elections. We agree to establish a pan-German committee composed of representatives from East and West Germany. This committee will study the preconditions for holding pan-German elections and draft an election law applicable to all of Germany." Grotewohl called on all those who support peace and unity in Germany to unite around a powerful movement.

    The Second Polish National Peace Congress was held in the State Council Hall in Warsaw. About 1,000 representatives from all over the country attended the congress. The speeches of the representatives from various regions at the conference pointed out the importance of striving for peace, opposing American warmongers, and strengthening the friendship between the people of all countries. They all unanimously demanded an immediate end to the Korean War. The congress elected a new Polish National Peace Committee composed of 147 members. The writer Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz was elected as the chairman of the committee. The congress also elected 30 representatives to attend the World People's Peace Congress.

    The All-India Peace Council recently held a meeting in Madras and decided to further strengthen the struggle to defend peace. The meeting passed a resolution "On the Korean Situation," condemning the United States for using "weapons of mass destruction against peaceful residents and engaging in germ warfare—not only against the Korean people but also against the Chinese people." The All-India Peace Council believes that the current situation in Korea is "the greatest threat to peace in Asia and peace in the world." In the resolution "On the Kashmir Issue," the All-India Peace Council expressed its firm opposition to the proposals on the Kashmir issue put forward by Britain and the United States in the Security Council. The resolution pointed out that the Anglo-American proposal is intended to "turn Kashmir into their military base." The All-India Peace Council called on peace committees in various regions and organizations supporting the peace movement to launch a week-long campaign on November 30th to express their support for the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna.

    In the United States, as early as the end of October, 24 American progressives formed an initiator organization to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress. Recently, 17 more prominent scientists, cultural workers, and pastors joined this organization. In its appeal to the American people, the initiator organization pointed out that it is necessary for representatives of the American people, regardless of belief, race, and political views, to unite in friendship and go to Vienna to join the people of other countries in saving peace. The recent voting in various cities on the question of an immediate ceasefire in Korea proves the will of the American people to defend peace. In New York, 95 percent of the workers consulted were in favor of an immediate ceasefire in Korea; more than 97 percent of the people consulted by the "Chicago Women for Peace" organization supported this demand; and people consulted in major cities such as Los Angeles and Detroit also expressed the same desire.

    According to the British Preparatory Committee for the World People's Peace Congress, Britain has elected 120 delegates to attend the congress, more than half of whom are members of the Labor Party. Many trade union organizations, disregarding the obstruction of the Labor Party leadership, participated in the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress.

    In West Germany, representatives to the World People's Peace Congress are being elected at mass rallies in various places. The Rhineland-Palatinate Peace Congress held in Ingelheim on the 23rd elected the state's representatives to attend the World People's Peace Congress. The congress also adopted an appeal to the people of Rhineland-Palatinate, calling on the people to support the World People's Peace Congress.

    各国人民加紧筹备和平大会
    据新华社讯：世界人民和平大会开会期近，各国和平组织正纷纷举行全国性保卫和平大会，改选和平运动的领导机构，收集各阶层人民预备向世界人民和平大会提出的意见，并推选出席和平大会的代表。
    参加世界人民和平大会的朝鲜代表团已于十一月二十日由平壤启程，前往维也纳出席大会。代表团由二十人组成，团长为朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长、世界和平理事会理事韩雪野，副团长为奇石福、鲁振汉和郑圣彦三人，秘书长为田东赫。
    德国促进互相了解与保卫和平大会于十一月二十八日在柏林开幕。出席大会的有德国东西两部的代表与来宾四千多人及许多外国来宾。大会由德国和平委员会主席腓特烈教授主持开幕。会上，格罗提渥总理发表了演说。他说：“我们要求按照德意志民主共和国人民议院的建议，举行有东西德代表参加的全德会议。会上必须研究所有争执中的问题，并讨论全德选举的准备措施。我们同意成立一个由东西德代表组成的全德委员会。这个委员会将研究举行全德选举的先决条件及草拟适用于全德国的选举法。”格罗提渥号召所有支持德国和平与统一的人团结在一个强大的运动周围。
    波兰第二届全国和平大会已在华沙国务委员会大厅举行。出席大会的有来自全国各地的约一千名代表。各地代表在大会上的发言都指出了争取和平、反对美国战争贩子以及加强各国人民友谊的斗争的重要意义。他们都一致要求立即停止朝鲜战争。大会选出了一个由一百四十七人组成的新的波兰全国和平委员会。作家雅·伊瓦茨凯维支当选为委员会主席。大会并选出了三十名出席世界人民和平大会的代表。
    全印和平理事会最近在马德拉斯举行会议，决定进一步加强保卫和平的斗争。会议曾通过“关于朝鲜局势问题”的决议，谴责美国使用“大规模毁灭和平居民的武器，进行细菌战——不但以朝鲜人民为对象，而且还以中国人民为对象”。全印和平理事会认为目前朝鲜的局势是“对亚洲和平与全世界和平的最大威胁”。全印和平理事会在“关于克什米尔问题”的决议中，表示坚决反对英国和美国在安全理事会提出的关于克什米尔问题的提案。决议指出：英美提案是为了“把克什米尔变成它们的军事基地”。全印和平理事会号召各地区的和平委员会和支持和平运动的组织，在十一月三十日发动一个为期一周的运动，以表示对维也纳世界人民和平大会的支持。
    美国早在十月底就由二十四位美国进步人士组成了筹备世界人民和平大会的发起人组织，最近又有十七个著名的科学家、文化工作者和牧师加入这组织。发起人组织在它的告美国人民书中指出：美国人民的代表们，不分信仰、种族和政治见解，友好地团结起来，到维也纳去和其他国家的人民共同拯救和平，这是必要的。在最近各城市举行的关于在朝鲜立即停火问题的投票，证明了美国人民保卫和平的意志。在纽约有百分之九十五被征询意见的工人赞成立即在朝鲜停火；“芝加哥妇女争取和平”组织所征询意见的人们中有百分之九十七以上支持这个要求；在洛杉矶和底特律等大城市中，被征询意见的人们也表示了同样的愿望。
    据世界人民和平大会英国筹备委员会宣布，英国已选出参加大会代表一百二十人，其中一半以上是工党党员。许多工会组织，不顾工党领导集团的阻挠，参加了世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。
    在西德，出席世界人民和平大会的代表正在各地的群众大会上选举出来。二十三日在因该尔海姆地方举行的莱因兰—伐尔兹州和平大会，已选出了该州出席世界人民和平大会的代表。大会并通过告莱因兰—伐尔兹州人民书，号召人民支持世界人民和平大会。
