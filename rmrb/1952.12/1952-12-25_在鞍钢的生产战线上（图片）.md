On the Anshan Iron and Steel Production Front

Over the past three years, with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts and the active efforts of all employees, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company has rapidly restored iron and steel production, with output and quality improving day by day. Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines have now successfully completed their annual national gross production value plan and overfulfilled their annual production increase and conservation tasks. This is a corner of the exterior of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant is engaged in intense production. Huge automatic cranes neatly arrange the ore-filled charging cans, waiting for the winding machine to transport them to the blast furnace.

The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Steelmaking Plant, with the help of Soviet experts, created a new open-hearth steelmaking record of six hours and nine minutes per furnace, surpassing the steelmaking time level of capitalist countries, and also completed the annual production task 21 days ahead of schedule. This is the situation when the steel is tapped.

The workers of the No. 4 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Plant resolutely learned from the advanced Soviet experience, mastered the fast ironmaking method, and comprehensively overfulfilled the national production task, becoming a model furnace of the Ironmaking Plant. This is the situation when the No. 4 Blast Furnace is tapping iron.

Steelmaking workers cast molten steel into steel ingots, which are then sent to the primary rolling mill to be made into various steel products.

These are the large quantities of steel products made from steel ingots in the primary rolling mill, which will be transported to factories to manufacture various equipment.

The signalman and furnace chief of the No. 4 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Plant observe various instruments in the control room to understand the production situation of the entire blast furnace.

Liu Zhen, the young furnace chief of the No. 4 Blast Furnace, often conducts technical education for ironmaking workers in the gaps between work, studying how to improve iron quality and increase output.

The factory director listens to reports on the blast furnace production situation every day. This is Liu Zhen reporting on the day's production situation. Photo by our reporter Zhu Bo.

    在鞍钢的生产战线上
    国营鞍山钢铁公司三年来在苏联专家热忱的帮助和全体职工的积极努力下，迅速地恢复了钢铁生产，产量和质量也一天比一天提高。鞍钢各厂矿现已胜利完成全年国家生产总值计划，并超额完成全年的增产节约任务。这是鞍钢炼铁厂外景的一角。
    鞍钢炼铁厂正在紧张地进行生产，巨型的自动吊车把装满矿石的装料罐整齐地排列好，等待卷扬机把它运上高炉。
    鞍钢炼钢厂的工人们在苏联专家的帮助下，创造了六小时零九分钟炼一炉钢的平炉炼钢新纪录，超过了资本主义各国炼钢时间的水平，并且还提前二十一天完成了全年的生产任务。这是出钢时的情形。
    炼铁厂第四高炉的工人们坚决学习了苏联先进经验，掌握了快速炼铁法，全面超额完成国家生产任务，成为炼铁厂的模范炉。这是四高炉出铁时的情形。
    炼钢工人把钢水铸成钢锭，然后送到初轧厂，制成各种钢材。
    这是初轧厂用钢锭制成的大批的钢材，将运到工厂里去制造各种器材。
    炼铁厂四高炉的信号员和炉长，在操作室内察看各种仪表，以了解整个高炉的生产情况。
    四高炉青年炉长刘真在工作空隙中，时常向炼铁工人进行技术教育，研究如何提高铁的质量和增加产量等问题。
    厂长每天听取高炉生产情况的汇报。这是刘真正在汇报一天的生产情况。本报记者  朱波  摄
