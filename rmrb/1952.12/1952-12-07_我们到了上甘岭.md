    We Arrived at Shangganling
    By Zhu Dannan, Deputy Head of the Third Sub-Group of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

    Shangganling is known by the Volunteer Army soldiers as the "Gate of Peace." To defend this gate, they engaged in fierce battles with the American wolf pack led by Van Fleet. On October 17th, the fourth day of the intense battle of Shangganling, some members of the Third Sub-Group of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea arrived in the Shangganling area to express their regards to the heroic troops defending the "Gate of Peace." "Chairman Mao has sent people to see us!" "Representatives of the people of the Motherland have arrived!" The news of the delegation's arrival spread as quickly as the news of victory from the front lines, immediately sweeping across the front and rear of this heroic position. The image of the great Motherland immediately appeared in the frontline tunnels, in the rear command posts, and in the field hospitals; it appeared before the eyes of commanders, soldiers, the wounded, and all personnel on this heroic position. The affectionate word "Motherland" was immediately written on banners and incorporated into rhythmic verses; it immediately transformed into songs, flying out from everyone's heart.
    On this very day, a platoon of brave soldiers from this heroic unit engaged in a fierce battle with an enemy force ranging from a platoon to two battalions on the Shangganling position for an entire day, repelling over forty enemy assaults. Then, they proactively withdrew into the tunnels to hold their ground. In the evening, superiors sent people through the enemy's intense artillery blockade and the surveillance of hilltop sentries, delivering the gifts from the people of the Motherland brought by the delegation – candies, cigarettes.... These precious gifts moved all the soldiers to tears, and they immediately raised their hands and swore: "We will resolutely fight to the end for the Motherland!" Wang Zhiming, a Youth League member who had been wounded twice, exclaimed excitedly: "As long as I have a breath left, I will resolutely fight to victory!" That very night, they cooperated with the counter-attacking forces, and with the support of our army's powerful artillery fire, in less than thirty minutes, they recaptured the position that the enemy had desperately fought for all day, annihilating an entire reinforced company of the enemy entrenched around our tunnels. Our Matrosov-style combat hero, Comrade Huang Jiguang, the communications soldier, gloriously sacrificed himself in this battle. Before throwing himself into battle, Huang Jiguang told his comrades: "Tell the delegation of the people of the Motherland to listen for news of our victory!" It was precisely the care and support of the people of the Motherland – this immense power – that encouraged our heroes to fearlessly wage a resolute struggle against the enemy.
    On the evening of the 18th, the direct unit of this force held a grand evening party to welcome the delegation. A leader told the members of the delegation:
    "We will use victory to welcome your arrival, and we will use even greater victory to see you off on your return home. Wait for good news." The next night, as the delegation members slept, they heard bursts of earth-shattering artillery fire coming from not far ahead. This was the sound of victory, the sound of our artillery punishing the American wolf pack. On this single day – October 19th – our heroic troops annihilated more than two thousand five hundred enemies.
    The delegation sent two representatives – the famous industrial labor model Niu Rusen and the young literary and art worker Lu Zhuguo – to the frontline tunnels of Shangganling to express their regards. When the soldiers in the tunnels heard that representatives of the delegation were coming, they had already arranged the tunnels neatly. The tunnels were filled with slogans, and candles were lit on every pillar. From the loudspeaker at the tunnel entrance, the majestic songs of "The Volunteer Army Anthem" and "Ode to the Motherland" were playing. The representatives entered the tunnels amidst warm applause and cheers. In this small tunnel, under the bright candlelight, a significant meeting was held. Comrade Niu Rusen presented a bouquet of flowers to the heroic sons of the Motherland – machine gun squad leader Lu He and his six comrades. Lu He had just engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. He stubbornly persisted in tunnel warfare, repelling twenty-one enemy assaults. Although he was wounded, he continued to fight, ultimately annihilating more than seventy enemies. Lu He forgot his pain and warmly grasped the representative's hand, eagerly asking: "How is the construction of the Motherland going?" "Is Chairman Mao healthy?" When the soldiers heard the representative report on the glorious achievements made by the people of the Motherland in various construction endeavors over the past three years, and when they spoke of the good health of the great leader Chairman Mao, thunderous cheers and slogans erupted in the tunnels. The representatives of the people of the Motherland and the heroic sons of the Motherland sang joyfully about the Motherland and cheered for victory on this heroic position.
    The delegation sent representatives to visit the wounded soldiers staying in the field hospital behind the position. Some of them had participated in the Battle of Shangganling and had just come down from the front lines. When everyone heard that the delegation of the people of the Motherland had arrived, they were so excited that they could not sleep. The slightly wounded ran a long way to greet the representatives, and the seriously wounded lit lamps and sat waiting for the representatives to arrive. One seriously wounded soldier could not sit up, so he held a candle to the representative's face, determined to see the messenger of the people of the Motherland. Like a poet, he spoke passionately to the representative: "People of the Motherland, I haven't seen you for so long, my mother!" He insisted that the representative sing a song praising the great Motherland. He said, "I want to hear the songs of the Motherland." A seriously wounded soldier who was blind in both eyes, when he received his gift and learned that it contained a photo of Chairman Mao, touched the photo again and again, first placing it on his chest and then putting it in the small pocket of his cotton coat. He said, "With him, my eyes are bright." Dear Motherland, great leader, what could give the heroic soldiers more courage and strength than this! The Volunteer Army soldiers cherished the gifts given to them by the people of the Motherland, and they thought of how precious these gifts were when they saw them. When a certain anti-aircraft artillery company of the Volunteer Army in Shangganling received the gifts from the people of the Motherland, political instructor Ren Xiaosheng held up high the white porcelain teacup painted with the red characters "Presented to the Most Beloved People" and said to the gunners: "Comrades! This was sent to us by the esteemed Chairman Mao and the people of the Motherland, who sent a delegation across mountains and rivers from our distant Motherland. How should we respond to Chairman Mao and the people of the Motherland?" The gunners all raised their hands and shouted: "Respond with victory!" The very next day – on the morning of November 1st – just as the sun was rising over the mountains, twelve American F-26 naval fighter planes, in groups of three, formed into triangular formations and flew towards our artillery position. The gunners, seeing that the opportunity to repay the Motherland with victory had arrived, all kept their eyes glued to the sights, waiting. However, the American air bandits, who had been battered and frightened, accelerated as soon as they flew over our position and quickly flew past at an altitude of over five thousand meters. The gunners were regretting missing the opportunity when the four planes flying behind turned around and dived towards our position. The gunners aimed at the enemy planes that were pulling up after dropping their bombs and fired fiercely, and one enemy plane immediately burst into flames and crashed from an altitude of two thousand meters into a mountain gully two hundred meters away from the gunners. After a while, the remaining eight enemy planes flew over again and blindly strafed our position from an altitude of over three thousand meters. The calm gunners raised the range and formed an interlocking fire net to fire at the enemy planes. At this moment, the enemy's ground artillery fire also fell on our position. One gunner shouted: "Comrades, keep calm! Don't forget what is written on the cigarettes sent by the people of the Motherland: 'Strike the American aggressors'!" After five minutes of intense fighting, they shot down two more enemy planes, and three others were hit and escaped, spewing thick smoke. In this way, our brave gunners shot down and damaged a total of six enemy planes in half an hour. After the battle, the gunners picked up a hat worn by an American air bandit and a parachute of the American air force that had been half burned. They handed over these two trophies and a letter they had written to the delegation to take to Chairman Mao and the people of the Motherland as a gift in return.
    Before the delegation left the Shangganling area, they received a long letter from all the brave soldiers who were holding the tunnels on Hill 597.9 of Shangganling. That was the place where the fighting was fiercest, where the hilltop had been almost shaved down two meters by the enemy's artillery fire. Because this letter had to pass through the enemy's artillery blockade, it was passed around and delivered, it had been worn through in several places and was missing a dozen or so words. In this letter, the brave soldiers reported to Chairman Mao and the people of the Motherland how they had overcome difficulties and persisted in fighting, and thanked Chairman Mao and the people of the Motherland for their regards. The letter read: "We are in a situation where we are fifty meters away from the enemy, with both sides holding their ground, and we have also encountered many difficulties, but we have thought of ways and carried forward the spirit of hard work. In order to defend the glorious position, in order to defend the Motherland, in order to defend world peace, we have endured and overcome the difficulties." No difficulty could shake the soldiers' will to fight. "The ten days of fighting life have been tense and pleasant. We have been guarding against the enemy and attacking the enemy day and night, fighting in the tunnels, one after another. Our comrades who are wounded do not leave the front lines. For example, Comrade Lai Fajun, a member of the Youth League, was wounded twice in the counterattack battle, did not leave the front lines, bandaged his wounds, continued to fight, destroyed an enemy bunker, and annihilated more than fifty enemies. In the end, he gloriously and heroically sacrificed himself. Another example is Squad Leader Cui Hanbi, whose hands were wounded, but he still wanted to charge. He was wounded four times in total, but he continued to fight, repelling five enemy counterattacks, annihilating thirty-eight enemies, and destroying one enemy firepower point.... Such examples of bravery and tenacity are too numerous to mention." Our brave soldiers are full of revolutionary heroism and optimism. Although the enemy pours hundreds of thousands of shells on their heads every day, what about our soldiers? They said: "Besides fighting, we talk, laugh and entertain ourselves, talking about our victories, talking about the greatness of the Motherland, and singing songs.... Our mood is always pleasant, and we are not afraid of being blockaded by the enemy and blocking the tunnel entrance, because we know the importance of the mission, understand the meaning of the battle, and firmly believe that we will win."
    When we returned to the Motherland with this letter, news of the victory that more than 20,000 enemies had been annihilated had been received from the Shangganling front. Our brave soldiers had already used words that were more vivid and powerful than this letter to thank them for their care and support for the people of the Motherland. (Attached images)

They destroyed five enemy tanks and one ammunition depot with twenty-three shells, killing and wounding a large number of enemies. The entire platoon was awarded the collective second-class merit once on the position.

    我们到了上甘岭
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第三分团副团长　朱丹南
    上甘岭被志愿军战士们称做“和平的大门”，为了守卫这座大门，他们和范佛里特率领的美国狼群进行了激烈的战斗。十月十七日这天，是上甘岭激战的第四天，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第三分团的一部分团员到了上甘岭地区，慰问这支守卫“和平的大门”的英雄部队。“毛主席派人来看我们啦！”“祖国人民的代表来啦！”——慰问团到来的消息，和前线胜利的消息传播得一样快，立刻一阵风似地传遍了这个英雄阵地的前后方。伟大祖国的形象，又立刻出现在前沿的坑道里，出现在后方的指挥所里和野战医院里；出现在这个英雄阵地的指挥员、战斗员、伤病员和一切工作人员的眼前。“祖国”，这个亲切的字眼，立刻被写在标语上，编到快板里；立刻变成了歌声，从每个人的心中飞出来。
    正是这一天，这支英雄部队的一个排的勇士们，在上甘岭阵地上，和一个排到两个营的敌人进行了一整天的激烈的争夺战，打退了敌人四十多次的冲锋，然后，主动地转入坑道坚守。晚上，上级派人通过敌人的猛烈炮火的封锁和山头岗哨的监视，送来了慰问团带来的祖国人民的礼物——糖果、香烟……。这种高贵的礼物，使所有的战士都感动得流下了热泪，他们立刻举手宣誓：“坚决为祖国战斗到底！”两次负伤的战士、青年团员王志明激动地说：“我只要有一口气，就要坚决战斗到胜利！”就在这天晚上，他们配合反击部队，在我军强大炮火的支援下，不到三十分钟，就把敌人拚命争夺了一天的阵地又夺了回来，把盘踞在我坑道四周的敌人的一个加强连全部歼灭了。我们的马特洛索夫式的战斗英雄——通讯员黄继光同志就是在这次战斗中光荣牺牲的。黄继光在投入战斗之前对战友们说：“告诉祖国人民慰问团，听我胜利的消息吧！”正是祖国人民的关怀和支援——这种巨大的力量，鼓舞着我们的英雄奋不顾身地对敌人进行坚决的斗争。
    十八日晚上，这个部队的直属队举行了一个隆重的晚会欢迎慰问团。一位首长对慰问团团员们说：
    “我们要用胜利来欢迎你们的到来，我们还要以更大的胜利欢送你们回国，等着好消息吧。”第二天夜晚，慰问团团员们在睡梦中听到，从前面不远的地方，传来一阵阵的惊天动地的炮声。这是胜利的声音，这是我们的大炮惩罚美国狼群的声音。仅仅这一天——十月十九日，我们的英雄部队就歼灭了二千五百多名敌人。
    慰问团派遣了两位代表——著名的工业劳动模范牛汝森和青年文艺工作者陆柱国到上甘岭前沿坑道里去进行慰问。坑道里的战士们听说慰问团的代表要来了，早已把坑道布置得整整齐齐。坑道里贴满了标语，每个柱子上都燃起了蜡烛。坑道口的扩音机里，传出来“志愿军战歌”与“歌唱祖国”的雄壮的歌声。代表们在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中走进了坑道，就在这个不大的坑道里，在这明亮的烛光下，开了一个意义重大的慰问会。牛汝森同志把一束鲜花献给祖国的英雄子弟——机枪班长卢河同志和他的六位战友。卢河刚刚和敌人进行了肉搏战，他顽强地坚持坑道战，打退了敌人二十一次冲锋，他虽然负了伤，但是仍然继续战斗，结果歼灭敌人七十多名。卢河忘记了创痛，他紧紧地握住代表的手，热情地向代表探听：“祖国建设怎样？”“毛主席健康吗？”当战士们听到代表报告三年来祖国人民在各种建设事业上取得了辉煌的成就，说到伟大的领袖毛主席身体健康时，坑道里爆发了震耳的欢呼声和口号声。祖国人民的代表和祖国人民的英雄子弟们，在这英雄的阵地上尽情地歌唱祖国，欢呼胜利。
    慰问团派遣代表去慰问住在阵地后方野战医院里的伤员。这里有些人是参加了上甘岭战斗，刚下火线不久的。大家听到祖国人民慰问团来了，兴奋地连觉也睡不着了。轻伤的跑了老远来迎接代表，重伤的点起灯来坐着等待代表到来。一位重伤员不能坐起来，就拿蜡烛照着代表的脸，一定要看看祖国人民的使者。他像诗人一样地向代表说着充满热情的话：“祖国的人民，我好久都没有看到你们了，我的母亲啊！”他一定要代表唱一支歌颂伟大祖国的歌，他说：“我要听听祖国的歌声。”一位双目失明的重伤员，当他分得了慰问品，知道里面有一张毛主席的照片时，他就把这张照片摸了又摸，先把它放在胸口上，然后又把它装进棉衣的小口袋里。他说：“和他在一起，我的眼睛就亮啦。”亲爱的祖国，伟大的领袖，还有什么比这更能给予英雄的战士们以更多的勇气和力量的呢！志愿军战士珍惜祖国人民赠给他们的礼物，他们一看到这些礼物，就想起它们是如何的可贵。当上甘岭志愿军高射炮某连接到祖国人民的慰问品时，政治指导员任小生把漆着“赠给最可爱的人”红字的白瓷茶缸高高举起，对炮手们说：“同志们！这是敬爱的毛主席和祖国人民，隔着千山万水，从遥远的祖国派慰问团给我们送来的。咱们该怎样回答毛主席和祖国人民呢？”炮手们一齐举手高呼：“用胜利来回答！”就在第二天——十一月一日早晨，太阳刚刚出山，十二架美国F—二六型海军战斗机，一组一组地排成三角队形，向我炮兵阵地飞过来。炮手们看到用胜利回答祖国的机会到了，都把着瞄准镜等着。可是挨打挨怕了的美国空中强盗，一飞到我阵地上空，就加大油门，从五千公尺以上的高空快速地飞过去了。炮手们正在惋惜错过了机会，飞在后面的四架，掉回头就向我阵地俯冲下来。炮手们对准了投弹后正向上冲的敌机猛烈射击，一架敌机立刻燃起熊熊的火焰，从二千公尺的高空，倒栽到离开炮手们二百公尺处的山沟里去了。过了一会儿，其余的八架敌机又飞过来，在三千公尺以上的高空向我阵地盲目扫射。沉着的炮手们架高了距离，组成交织的火网向敌机射击。正在这时，敌人的地面炮火也向我阵地打过来。一位炮手喊道：“同志们，沉着气呀！不要忘记祖国人民送来的香烟上写的‘打击美国侵略者’呀！”经过五分钟的激烈战斗，他们又击落了两架敌机，另有三架也被击中冒着浓烟逃走了。就这样，我们神勇的炮手们，在半小时内一共击落击伤敌机六架。炮手们在战斗结束后拾回来一顶美国空中强盗戴的帽子和一个烧去了半边的美国空军的降落伞，他们把这两件战利品和他们写的一封信交给慰问团带给毛主席和祖国人民，作为他们回敬的礼物。
    在慰问团离开上甘岭地区之前，接到了上甘岭五九七点九高地坚守坑道的全体勇士们的一封长信。那里就是战斗最激烈、山头几乎被敌人的炮火削低两公尺的地方。这封信因为通过敌人炮火的封锁，展转传递，已经磨破了数处，缺了十几个字。勇士们在这封信里向毛主席和祖国人民报告他们如何战胜困难、坚持战斗的情形，答谢毛主席和祖国人民的慰问。信上写道：“我们处在距敌五十公尺、上下相持的情况下，也遭受了不少的困难，但是，我们想了办法，发扬了艰苦的精神。为了保卫光荣阵地，为了保卫祖国，为了保卫世界的和平，我们忍受了和战胜了困难。”一切的困难都不能动摇勇士们战斗的意志，“十天的战斗生活，是紧张而愉快的，我们不分昼夜地警戒敌人和出击敌人，前仆后继地战斗在坑道里。我们的同志负了伤不下火线，如青年团员赖发均同志，在反击战斗中，连续负伤两次，不下火线，裹好伤口，继续战斗，打掉敌地堡
    一个，歼敌五十多名，最后他光荣壮烈地牺牲了。又如班长崔含弼同志，两手负伤后，还要冲锋，负伤共四次，仍在继续战斗，打退了敌人五次反扑，歼敌三十八名，破坏敌火力点一个……像这样勇敢顽强的事例，是不能尽举的”。我们的勇士们是充满了革命的英雄主义和乐观主义的精神的。虽然敌人每天在他们的头上倾泻几十万发的炮弹，但是我们的战士呢？他们说：“我们除了战斗以外，就是说笑和娱乐，谈着我们的胜利，谈着祖国的伟大，还唱着歌曲……我们的心情永远都是愉快的，丝毫没有因被敌人封锁和闭塞坑道口而感到恐惧，因为我们知道任务的重大，明确战斗的意义，坚信我们一定胜利。”
    当我们带着这封信回到祖国的时候，上甘岭前线传来了已经歼敌两万多名的胜利消息。我们的勇士们已经用比这封信更生动、更有力的言语，来答谢他们对祖国人民的关怀和支援了。（附图片）
