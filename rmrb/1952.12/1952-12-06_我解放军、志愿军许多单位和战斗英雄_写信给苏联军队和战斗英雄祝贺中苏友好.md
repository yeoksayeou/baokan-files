Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA), along with famous combat heroes and soldiers, wrote letters to Soviet troops and Soviet combat heroes, warmly congratulating the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and expressing their determination to learn from the Soviet army's heroic spirit in defending the motherland and safeguarding peace.

The entire officers and men of the First Flying Brigade of a certain Air Force unit of the PLA in North China jointly wrote a letter to the Soviet hero Kozhedub. The letter stated: "In the heroic Soviet army, there are countless heroic names that we will never forget, such as Captain Kulishenko, who, far from his homeland, aided our country in the War of Resistance Against Japan with a high degree of internationalism, and you, the outstanding hero who shot down sixty-two enemy planes and won the 'Gold Star Medal' three times. These are all examples for us to learn from. We must learn from your high sense of responsibility to the motherland and the world's cause of peace; learn your skillful flying techniques and tenacious spirit of learning; learn your strong will and determination and perseverance to develop a strong physique; learn your high degree of organization and discipline in obeying orders and commands; and learn the spirit of fraternal love and cooperation in life-and-death combat between lead and wingman, and the close unity between air and ground crews, so as to strive to build our strong People's Air Force and resolutely defend our motherland's airspace and world peace."

Zhang Shengen, a soldier of the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the Hunan Military Region of the PLA, wrote a letter to the Soviet army, saying: During these precious days of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," I thought of you, who have produced countless heroes like Alexei Maresyev in the cause of defending peace and the motherland, who are precisely the role models for us to learn from. For the sake of the motherland and world peace, we are determined to stand firm at our fighting posts and strive to learn your advanced military science and technology, and give a devastating blow to any enemy who dares to invade us.

Zhang Xiaocai, battalion commander of a certain CPVA unit on the Korean front and a special-class merit recipient, and all the officers and men of the battalion wrote a letter to all the officers and men of the Soviet army. The letter first described the glorious deeds of February 9, 1951, when they blocked the joint attack of the US 2nd Infantry Division's 9th Regiment and the ROK (Republic of Korea) Army's 8th and 3rd Divisions at Wuyin Mountain, recaptured Height 320, and repelled the enemy's seven charges. The letter continued: "Why are we so brave? Because we know that the path we are taking is the very path you once took. Seven years ago, you shed blood in Korea, where you eliminated the Japanese fascist bandits, allowing the people of northern Korea to gain liberation and freedom. Korean grandmothers and grandfathers told us many stories about your heroic deeds. When the struggle was at its most difficult, we thought of you; when the battle was at its most dangerous, we thought of you. We thought: your blood cannot be shed in vain! We are continuing to carry forward your heroic spirit in Korea, treating the American aggressors as you treated the Japanese bandits!"

The soldiers of the "Wang Lichang Squad" of a certain unit of the CPVA wrote a letter to all the soldiers of the 254th Guards Assault Regiment named after Alexander Matrosov. The letter stated: "Our squad leader, Wang Lichang, learned from Matrosov's great spirit of self-sacrifice, sacrificing himself to destroy two enemy tanks and block fourteen enemy tanks, ensuring the victory of the entire battle. When we think of Matrosov and our squad leader Wang Lichang, an incomparably brave force arises. We must forever learn their great and noble spirit, crush the American aggressors' aggression, and defend peace in the Far East and the world."
