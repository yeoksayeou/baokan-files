The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau Convenes a Special Meeting to Inspect and Improve the Handling of People's Letters and Reception of the Public

To inspect and improve the work of handling people's letters and receiving the public in various parts of North China, the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau convened a special meeting on November 10th, gathering more than 30 cadres responsible for this work from first-level units of North China, provincial committees of various provinces in North China, municipal committees of Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Baoding, Guihua (now Hohhot), Xinxiang, and the Ding County District Committee. The General Office of the CCP Central Committee and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CCP Central Committee sent personnel to attend and provide guidance. The meeting concluded on November 13th after three days of reporting and discussion.

Since the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" was vigorously resolved by the North China Bureau in the later stage of the "Three-Anti" movement, the work of handling people's letters and receiving the public in various parts of North China has seen significant improvement. In the past, many organs and cadres regarded people's letters as "trivial matters" and ignored them. They made things difficult for the masses who came to visit and lodge complaints, pushing them around and delaying action. The thorough handling of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" aroused the attention of Party and government leading organs in various places to the work of handling people's letters and receiving the public. Many regions organized the study of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," conducted inspections, made relevant decisions, and cleared accumulated letters. Responsible cadres of some provinces and cities personally reviewed people's letters or regularly inspected the progress of this work. The Linfen Prefectural Office of Shanxi Province stipulated that the commissioner must receive the public regularly, and the Yi County magistrate has decided to receive the public on the 1st and 15th of each month. Many places have strengthened the organization of people's inquiry offices. For example, ten of the twelve counties in the Ding County Special District of Hebei Province have established inquiry offices, and Guihua City in Suiyuan Province has established eight inquiry offices and twenty-one suggestion boxes. Jiaocheng County in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City have also established "reply boards" and a "processing card system" to ensure proper handling of issues raised by the masses. Some regions have even adopted the method of the North China Bureau in handling the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" to vigorously handle major incidents revealed in people's letters and visits, such as the Liao Zhongyi, Zhang Sanyuan, Shen Junyi, Yang Yuehui, Guo Jinsheng, and Taidi Village in Yi County, Hebei, so that many problems have been solved, greatly promoting justice and enhancing the prestige of the Party and the people's government among the masses. The number of people's letters and visits has increased unprecedentedly. According to incomplete statistics from various provinces and cities in North China, since the beginning of this year, excluding the materials reported during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, more than 50,000 letters and reports from the people have been received. The General Office of the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau received an average of one letter per day and one visitor every ten days in April and May. In the three months after the handling of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," it received an average of six letters per day and three visitors every two days. This has created more favorable conditions for continuing to expose and eliminate bureaucracy, violations of law and discipline, and all phenomena unfavorable to the people.

However, according to the report of Liang Yingyong, director of the General Office of the North China Bureau, at the meeting, and the situation reflected by cadres from various places in the meeting, this work has not been done well in some places to this day and has not met the requirements of the Party and the people, and must be further strengthened. Some cadres of some leading organs, due to sectarianism or serious bureaucracy, intentionally or unintentionally condone and accommodate those who violate the law and discipline, and fail to handle the problems raised by the people in a timely manner, resulting in serious detachment from the masses. Some organs and cadres still cannot seriously handle people's letters or listen to people's complaints, pushing them down and ignoring them, allowing them to be delayed and accumulated, without inspection or supervision. To superiors, they practice "hand-in-the-paper-ism," simply forwarding the original texts. In particular, when solving major incidents reflected by the people, some cadres, because they do not trust the masses or rely on the masses, cannot break out of the small circles of cadres, listen to only one side of the story, and are taken advantage of by some cadres who deceive their superiors and conceal the truth, covering up the truth and drawing completely unrealistic conclusions, making the problems unresolved for a long time. The long-term failure to expose the Taidi Village incident is the reason for this. Li Jintang of the People's Supervision Committee of Baoding Prefecture once mistakenly believed that Niu Luolian, a rogue element with numerous crimes in the Taidi Village incident, still "met the requirements for party membership" and falsely accused Zhao Yazhen, who exposed Niu Luolian's crimes, of "falsely accusing a good person."

Based on the situation reflected and the problems raised in the meeting, Hou Weiyu, Secretary-General of the North China Bureau, made a concluding speech. He particularly emphasized strengthening ideological leadership in handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. He pointed out that this work is a major issue related to the interests of the broad masses of the people, and it is an important aspect of the Party and the government directly contacting the masses, serving the masses, and learning from the masses. It vividly reflects the mass viewpoint of Communist Party members and state workers, and directly expresses the various opinions and demands of the masses, providing rich materials of great significance for the Party and the government to guide current work. As Communist Party members and state workers, we have no right to ignore or handle the opinions and demands of the masses carelessly. This work should be used as an important weapon for exposing violations of law and discipline and carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy. We must be good at studying the materials reflected in people's letters and visits, and discover policy issues related to politics, production, and life that are closely related to the broad masses. We must take the initiative to combine this work with current political movements and central tasks in a planned way. We must be good at discovering outstanding Communist Party members, state workers, and activists among the masses, especially those who bravely expose bureaucracy, fight against bureaucracy, and are not discouraged even when they are attacked, and use them as typical examples to educate everyone. As for the evil elements who seek revenge because their crimes have been exposed, we must resolutely fight against them and severely punish them. Then, he gave many specific instructions on the organizational leadership and working methods of this work.

During the meeting, everyone also heard about Chairman Mao's attention and concern for this work. Despite Chairman Mao's extremely busy work, he still personally reviewed and personally replied to some letters, checking the handling results. Chairman Mao personally reviewed the regular reports of the General Office of the CCP Central Committee on people's letters and gave practical instructions. He earnestly instructed the comrades in the General Office of the Central Committee who were doing this work to pay attention to this work, to pay attention to the demands raised by the masses, and to care about these issues, so that our Party and government can achieve closer contact with the masses. Comrade Liu Lantao was also very serious and very concerned about this work. In addition to reading and personally replying to some letters, he often wrote letters to responsible comrades of various organs in North China to check the handling of people's letters and urge them to take this work seriously. Everyone was greatly moved and educated when they heard these facts and saw Chairman Mao's instructions on some letters and his handwritten letters, and they further deepened their understanding of the great significance of seriously handling people's letters and the importance of this work.

This meeting was convened under the guidance of Comrade Liu Lantao. Before and during the meeting, Comrade Lantao constantly listened to reports and gave clear instructions. Comrade Wang Congwu, Minister of the Organization Department of the North China Bureau, also attended the meeting and spoke. This meeting will play an important role in the anti-bureaucracy struggle in various parts of North China.

Based on the requirements put forward at this meeting, the North China Bureau recently issued "Instructions on Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses." The General Office of the North China Bureau has also drafted the "Procedures for Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses" by the General Office of the North China Bureau. The provinces and cities will soon organize in-depth dissemination in accordance with the spirit of the meeting and instructions to strengthen the work of handling people's letters and receiving the people in Party and government organs at all levels, especially at the county level.

    中共中央华北局召开专门会议
    检查、改进处理人民来信和接见人民的工作
    为检查、改进华北各地处理人民来信与接见人民的工作，中共中央华北局于十一月十日召集华北一级各单位及华北各省省委，北京、天津、太原、保定、归绥、新乡等市市委及定县地委负责这一工作的干部三十余人，举行了专门会议。中共中央办公厅和中共中央纪律检查委员会曾派人出席指导。会议经过三天的报告、讨论，已于十一月十三日结束。
    华北各地处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，自今年“三反”运动后期华北局大张旗鼓地解决了“张顺有事件”之后，已有了显著改进。过去，曾有许多机关和干部，把人民来信看作是“小事情”而不闻不问。对来访、申诉的群众多方为难，东推西拖。“张顺有事件”的彻底处理，引起了各地党政领导机关对处理人民来信、接见人民工作的重视。很多地区组织了对“张顺有事件”的学习，进行检查，作出有关决定，清理积压的信件。有的省市的负责干部亲自批阅人民来信或定期检查这一工作的进行情况。山西省临汾专署规定专员须定期接见群众，猗氏县长已决定每月一、十五接见群众。不少地方充实了人民问事处的机构。如河北省定县专区十二个县已有十一个县建立了问事处，绥远省归绥市设立了八个问事处和二十一个意见箱。山西省交城县和太原市还建立了“批覆牌”和“处理卡片制”，以保证妥善处理群众所提出的问题。有些地区更采取了华北局处理“张顺有事件”的方法，有准备地大张旗鼓地处理了人民来信、来访中所揭露的重大事件，如廖中一、张三元、沈君一、杨月辉、郭金升、河北易县台底村等事件，使许多问题得到解决，大大伸张了正气，提高了党和人民政府在群众中的威信，人民来信、来访空前增多。据华北各省市的不完全统计，今年以来，除“三反”“五反”检举的材料以外，已收到人民来信、检举材料五万余件。中共中央华北局办公厅在四、五月间，每日平均收到人民来信一件，来访者十天一人；“张顺有事件”处理后的三个月中，每日平均收到人民来信六件，来访者两天有三人。这就为今后继续揭发并肃清官僚主义、违法乱纪和一切不利于人民的现象创造了更有利的条件。
    但是，根据华北局办公厅主任梁膺庸在会议上的报告及会议中各地干部所反映的情况看来，这一工作在某些地方直到今天还没有做好，还没有满足党和人民的要求，必须继续加强。有些领导机关的某些干部由于宗派主义或严重的官僚主义，对违法乱纪分子有意无意地姑息迁就，没有及时处理人民群众所提出的问题，以致严重地脱离了群众。有些机关和干部仍不能认真处理人民来信、倾听人民的申诉，对下推手不管，任其推拖积压，不检查，不督促，对上则是“交卷主义”，原文照转。特别是有些干部在解决人民群众所反映的重大事件时，由于不相信群众，不依靠群众，突不出干部的小圈子，偏听偏信，被一些欺上瞒下、封锁顽抗的干部钻了空子，掩盖了事实真相，得出完全不合实际的结论，使问题长期不得解决。台底村等事件长期不能被揭发，就是这个原因。保定专署人民监察委员会李锦堂就曾误认为台底村事件中罪行累累的流氓分子牛洛连还“够党员条件”，并反诬揭发牛洛连罪行的赵亚震是“诬告好人”。
    根据会议中所反映的情况和提出的问题，华北局秘书长侯维煜作了总结发言。他特别强调加强处理人民来信和接见人民来访工作的思想领导问题。他指出这一工作是有关广大人民利益的大事情，是党与政府直接联系群众、为群众服务而又向群众学习的一个重要的方面。它生动地反映了共产党员与国家工作人员的群众观点，也直接表达了人民群众的各种意见和要求，为党和政府提供了指导当前工作的具有很大意义的丰富材料。作为共产党员、国家工作人员，我们没有权利对群众的意见和要求置之不理或草率处理。应把这一工作作为揭发违法乱纪现象，开展反官僚主义斗争的重要武器。要善于研究群众来信、来访中所反映的材料，从中发现与广大群众密切联系的政治、生产、生活等方面带有政策性的问题。要主动而有计划地把这一工作与当前政治运动和中心工作结合起来。要善于发现优秀的共产党员、国家工作人员及群众中的积极分子，特别是那些勇敢大胆地揭发官僚主义、向官僚主义进行斗争、遭到打击仍不消极的人，以他们做典型教育大家。至于对因罪行被人揭发而寻仇报复的恶劣分子，则须坚决进行斗争，严加惩处。接着，他又对这个工作的组织领导和工作方法作了很多具体指示。
    会议期间，大家还听到毛主席对这一工作的重视和关怀。尽管毛主席的工作极为繁忙，但仍亲自批阅并亲复某些来信，检查处理结果。中共中央办公厅关于人民来信的定期报告，毛主席都亲自审阅，并给以切实的指示。他谆谆嘱咐中央办公厅作这一工作的同志要重视此项工作，重视群众向我们提出来的要求，关心这些问题，使我们的党和政府能与群众取得进一步密切的联系。刘澜涛同志对此项工作也是十分认真、十分重视的。他除批阅并亲复某些来信外，还经常给华北各地各机关的负责同志写信，检查人民来信的处理情况，并督促各地认真对待这一工作。大家听到这些事实，看到了毛主席对于某些来信的批示和亲笔写的信，都受到极大的感动与教育，进一步更深刻地认识到认真处理人民来信的重大意义，认识到这一工作的重要性。
    这一会议是在刘澜涛同志的指导下召开的，会前与会中澜涛同志都不断地听取报告，并给以明确的指示。华北局组织部长王从吾同志也曾到会讲话。这一会议对华北各地的反官僚主义斗争将起其重要的作用。
    华北局根据这一会议提出的要求，已于最近发出“关于处理人民来信、接见人民群众工作的指示”。华北局办公厅也已拟就华北局办公厅“处理人民来信、接见人民群众工作的程序”。各省、市即将根据会议和指示的精神，有组织地深入传达，以加强各级特别是县级党政机关处理人民来信、接见人民的工作。
