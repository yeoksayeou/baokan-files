    Kaiifeng People's Acrobatic Troupe Should Pay Attention to Performance Content
    Editor: In late October, the Kaifeng People's Acrobatic Troupe from Henan came to Shaoyang City, Hunan to perform acrobatics. The troupe's skills are indeed admirable in some respects, demonstrating the brave and intelligent characteristics of the Chinese people. However, there are vulgar and inhumane phenomena in the troupe's performances, and some programs even commit political errors. For example, when the troupe performs acrobatics, the actors slap each other in the face, kick each other in the butt, and sometimes shake children around violently, with the children deliberately pretending to be helpless and very uncomfortable. The troupe also misuses terms and vulgarizes political slogans, such as calling a broken stool with three legs "Soviet-style"; and saying that a child crawling through the legs of an inverted person is "crossing the Yalu River." There are many similar examples.
    I believe that the reason why the troupe has made the above-mentioned mistakes is due to the troupe's neglect of political study and ideological reform. In today's world, three years after liberation, the troupe's political level is still so low, which is an intolerable phenomenon. I hope that this matter will attract the serious attention of the relevant authorities. Hu Luo

### 开封人民杂技团应注意演出内容

    开封人民杂技团应注意演出内容
    编辑同志：十月下旬，河南开封人民杂技团来湖南邵阳市表演杂技。该团的技艺，诚然是有些令人赞叹的地方，表现出了我中国人民勇敢、智慧的特质。可是该团在演出的节目中，存在有庸俗和不人道的现象，有些节目还犯了政治性错误。如该团表演杂技时，演员互相打耳光，踢屁股，有时提着小孩乱甩一气，小孩也就故意装成无可奈何，非常难受的样子。该团还滥用名词，将政治口号庸俗化，如有一条三只腿的破凳，就说它是“苏联式”的；一个小孩从一个倒立的人的两腿中间，钻了过去，就说这是“跨过鸭绿江”。类似这样的例子是很多的。
    我认为该团之所以犯上述那些错误，是由于该团忽视政治学习与思想改造的结果。在解放三年以后的今天，该团政治水平仍是如此之低，这是不能令人容忍的现象。我希望这件事，能引起有关当局的严重注意。　胡洛
