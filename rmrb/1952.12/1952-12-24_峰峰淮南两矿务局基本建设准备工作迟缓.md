    Slow Progress in Basic Construction Preparation at Fengfeng and Huainan Mining Bureaus
    [This newspaper] The Fengfeng Mining Bureau's basic construction tasks this year have been completed very poorly. It is estimated that only 65.5 percent of the drilling tasks will be completed by the end of the year. The bureau's basic construction tasks for next year are more than double those of this year. However, the bureau's leadership has not yet taken swift measures to strengthen basic construction work. As of December 3, the bureau had transferred a group of cadres from production to strengthen basic construction work. However, the basic construction organization remains extremely incomplete. The new organizational structure does not even have a place to work. Most of the leading core members participating in basic construction work are transferred cadres who lack experience in basic construction. The bureau's basic construction engineering company has four managers, but only one deputy manager is relatively familiar with the business. What is particularly serious is that in the third quarter, in order to rush the production tasks, the bureau's No. 1 and No. 2 mines transferred two basic construction section chiefs and three engineering team leaders from basic construction to production posts. As of early December, these cadres had not all been transferred back to participate in basic construction work. Because the leadership did not pay attention to basic construction work, many preparatory tasks before construction have not yet begun. The bureau originally drafted a preparatory work plan, but because it wanted to wait for the new organizational structure to be established before implementing it, the original plan was not implemented. In order to supply the needs of next year's basic construction, the task of establishing subsidiary factories for bricks, stones, and wood has been determined, but the funds have not been secured, and the work still cannot be carried out. The timely supply of materials and equipment is one of the important factors to ensure the completion of next year's basic construction tasks, but as of early December, the bureau had not considered this issue at all. As of early December, no preparations had been made for the work of fixed workers and winter training.
    The Huainan Mining Bureau's basic construction tasks this year have also been completed poorly. It is estimated that only about 67 percent of the workload will be completed by the end of the year. Next year, the bureau's basic construction tasks are more than double those of this year, but the bureau's leading cadres have not paid attention to this situation, seriously "placed basic construction in a primary position," and stepped up preparatory work. After several urging by cadres sent by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry to inspect the work, the bureau convened a meeting on November 25 to study the establishment of institutions and carry out preparatory work. However, as of December 2, the bureau's new basic construction organization had not yet been established. Among the personnel proposed to be transferred to the basic construction department, many were also uneasy about their work and not very responsible. The bureau is preparing to establish a design department, but the original list of design department personnel only included thirteen engineers and no leading core members. Someone raised an objection to this, and the bureau's leading cadres then prepared to transfer a cadre who had committed errors in the "Three-Anti" campaign and had been demoted from director to section chief to the design department to serve as deputy director. In addition, a series of preparatory work before construction has not yet begun. The Huainan Mining Bureau's neglect of basic construction work is not only due to the bureau's leadership's vague thinking, but also the Coal Mine Management Bureau, which originally directly led the North China and East China mines, must bear a certain responsibility. After the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a coal mine basic construction meeting, the Coal Mine Management Bureau did not promptly convey the policy decided at the meeting. As of the end of November, when a responsible cadre of the Coal Mine Management Bureau inspected this year's drilling work and production situation in Huainan, he still did not implement the spirit of the coal mine basic construction meeting.

### 峰峰淮南两矿务局基本建设准备工作迟缓

    峰峰淮南两矿务局基本建设准备工作迟缓
    【本报讯】峰峰矿务局今年基本建设任务完成得很差，钻探任务到年底只能完成百分之六十五点五。该局明年基本建设的任务大于今年一倍多，但是，该局领导方面仍然没有迅速采取措施，加强基本建设工作。直到十二月三日为止，该局虽然也从生产方面抽调了一批干部加强基本建设工作，但是基本建设机构仍然极不健全，新的组织机构连办公的地方还没有。参加基本建设工作的领导骨干大多是对基本建设缺乏经验的转业干部。该局基本建设工程公司有四个经理，只有一个副经理比较熟悉业务。尤其严重的是，在第三季度中，为了突击生产任务，该局一矿、二矿曾从基本建设方面调了两个基本建设科长、三个工程队长到生产岗位上去。直到十二月初，这些干部还没有全部调回参加基本建设工作。由于领导方面没有重视基本建设工作，施工前的许多准备工作都还没有开始进行。该局原来拟定了一个准备工作计划，因为想等待新的组织机构成立后再实行，原来的计划就没有贯彻下去。为了供应明年基本建设的需要，建立砖石、木材等附属工厂的任务已确定，但资金没有着落，工作仍没法进行。材料设备的及时供应是保证明年基本建设任务完成的重要因素之一，但到十二月初，该局根本还没有考虑这个问题。固定工人的工作和冬训工作，到十二月初也还没有作任何准备。
    淮南矿务局今年的基本建设任务完成得也很不好，估计到年底只能完成工作量的百分之六十七左右。明年该局的基本建设任务大于今年一倍多，但该局领导干部没有重视这一情况，认真地“把基本建设放在首要地位”，加紧进行准备工作。经过中央人民政府燃料工业部派去检查工作的干部几次催促，该局才于十一月二十五日召开会议，研究建立机构和进行准备工作。但是，直到十二月二日，该局新的基本建设机构还没有建立起来。就在提出要抽调到基本建设部门去的人员中，有不少人也是工作不安心并且不大负责任的。该局准备成立设计处，但是原提出的设计处人员名单却只有十三位工程师而无领导骨干。有人对此提出意见，该局领导干部才准备把一个在“三反”中犯了错误的由处长降职为科长的干部调到设计处任副处长。此外，施工前的一系列的准备工作都还没有着手进行。淮南矿务局对基本建设工作如此忽视，除了因为该局领导思想模糊外，原来直接领导华北、华东各矿的煤矿管理总局也要负一定的责任。中央人民政府燃料工业部召开煤矿基本建设会议以后，煤矿管理总局没有及时向下传达会议所决定的方针。直到十一月末，煤矿管理总局的一个负责干部在淮南检查今年的钻探工作和生产情况时，仍然没有把煤矿基本建设会议的精神贯彻下去。
