    China Industrial Equipment Company Reorganized into Three Companies
    To meet the needs of the country's large-scale construction, the China Industrial Equipment Company was dissolved on December 20th, and reorganized into three companies: China Hardware & Machinery Company, China Transportation & Electrical Equipment Company, and China Chemical Raw Materials Company. These three specialized companies will implement an economic accounting system early next year and are preparing to establish specialized wholesale stations in the four major cities of Shenyang, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. The main tasks of the wholesale stations are to receive relevant imported materials, purchase relevant domestic materials, and process and order large quantities of relevant materials to meet the needs of construction and production.
    The variety of industrial equipment commodities is large and the business is complex, while the number of cadres managing the business is small and their quality is low, which cannot meet objective needs. Therefore, the original China Industrial Equipment Company, starting from the fourth quarter of this year, has established short-term training classes in various regions of the country, rotating on-the-job cadres to study in order to cultivate specialized cadres. It is estimated that 3,000 cadres familiar with the business can be trained in 1953.
    Currently, industrial equipment branch companies in various regions are signing supply contracts with various user departments in order to do a good job in supplying equipment for large-scale economic construction next year. (Zhao Kexiong)

    中国工业器材公司改组成立三个公司
    为了适应国家大规模建设的需要，中国工业器材公司在十二月二十日撤销原来机构，改组为中国五金机械、中国交通电工器材、中国化工原料三公司。这三个专业公司在明年初即将贯彻实行经济核算制。并准备分别在沈阳、天津、广州及上海等四大城市建立专业批发站。批发站的主要任务是接收有关进口物资，收购国内有关物资，并对大宗的有关物资实行加工订货，以供应建设和生产的需要。
    工业器材商品种类繁多，业务复杂，而经营业务的干部数量少，质量低，不能满足客观的需要。因此，原中国工业器材公司从今年第四季度起，在全国各地区成立了短期训练班，轮流抽调在职干部学习，以培养专业干部，估计一九五三年内可训练出三千名熟悉业务的干部。
    现各地工业器材分支公司正和各用货部门签订供应合同，以便做好明年大规模经济建设中的器材供应工作。（赵克雄）
