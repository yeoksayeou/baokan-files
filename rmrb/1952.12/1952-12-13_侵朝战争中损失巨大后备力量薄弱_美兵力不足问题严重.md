Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 12th: Due to the huge losses of American soldiers in the war of aggression against Korea, coupled with the shortage of troops and weak reserve strength, the current problem of insufficient American troops and weakened combat effectiveness is extremely serious.

In the two and a half years of the war of aggression against Korea, the United States suffered nearly 300,000 casualties in a small Korean battlefield, almost equal to the total number of casualties suffered by the United States during the entire period of World War I. These casualties were mostly among the most combat-experienced personnel in the U.S. military. These huge personnel losses have caused extreme difficulties in replenishing U.S. troops.

On the other hand, according to the current U.S. conscription system, the first large number of young people drafted into the army after the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea in 1950 have now successively completed their military service. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on November 22, 70,000 U.S. Army soldiers will have completed their terms of service this year. Due to the lack of personnel for rotation, the U.S. Department of Defense has adopted measures to delay rotation, which has further fueled the dissatisfaction of American soldiers on the battlefield who were already weary of war, thereby weakening the combat effectiveness of the army.

Due to the lack of reserve strength in the United States, how to recruit enough new soldiers has always been the most troublesome problem for the U.S. Department of Defense. Hershey, the director of the U.S. Selective Service System, has long been clamoring that the pool from which he draws manpower has been "gradually depleted." At the same time, Hershey also admitted that among the young people in the United States who have reached the age of service, the number of people who are not eligible for military service due to physical and intellectual standards is constantly increasing. According to his statement to the U.S. House of Representatives, as of April 30th of this year, as many as 45 percent of people were ineligible for military service due to health, psychological, and other reasons. Moreover, new recruits must undergo a certain period of training, which inevitably requires dividing a portion of the little remaining active regular troops in the country to undertake training work. This further weakens the strength of these regular troops, which had already drawn a large number of personnel to replenish the casualties in Korea. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on November 22nd has already admitted that as a result of the drawdown, some units remaining in the United States have "only a shell left." The Associated Press report pointed out that the shortage of personnel is particularly serious in the most decisive armed services, the Army and the Marine Corps. At the same time, due to the constant conscription of new soldiers and the frequent changes in units on the stretched-out front lines, another serious problem has arisen, namely, that a large number of personnel are actually ineffective. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. "Army frequently has about one-third of its personnel either in training or actually en route from one base to another."

The problem of officers is particularly difficult. The reduction in trained officers and the lack of reserve officers greatly limit the development and combat effectiveness of the entire army. The Associated Press revealed the shortage of officers in the U.S. military, saying: "Due to the reduction of 13,000 officer positions, the officer training program has also been greatly reduced. The number of soldiers who could have entered officer candidate schools has also been reduced by half. In addition, graduates recently from the Reserve Officer Training Corps will be assigned to temporary jobs for a period of time and can only postpone taking on actual work." The reality of insufficient U.S. troops dictates that its continued aggression against Korea will inevitably suffer even greater defeats.

### 侵朝战争中损失巨大后备力量薄弱  美兵力不足问题严重

    侵朝战争中损失巨大后备力量薄弱
    美兵力不足问题严重
    【新华社十二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国兵员在侵朝战争中损失巨大，加以兵源不足、后备力量薄弱，因此美国当前兵员不足和军队战斗力削弱的问题极为严重。
    美国在二年半侵朝战争中，在一个狭小的朝鲜战场上，伤亡就近三十万人，几乎与美国在第一次世界大战整个时期伤亡的总数相等。这些伤亡又大多是美国军队中最有战斗经验的人员。这种人员的巨大伤亡造成美国兵员补充上极大的困难。
    另一方面，按照美国现行兵役制度，在一九五○年美国发动侵朝战争后最初大批征召入伍的青年，现在已陆续服满兵役。据路透社华盛顿十一月二十二日消息，美国今年将有七万陆军士兵服役期满。由于轮换乏人，美国国防部曾采取拖延轮换的办法，这样就使战场上本来已经厌战的美国士兵更加滋长了不满情绪，从而削弱了军队的战斗力。
    由于美国后备力量不足，如何征召足够的新兵一直是美国国防部最感头痛的问题。美国征兵局局长赫希早就叫喊他吸取人力的那个池子已“渐告枯竭”。同时赫希还承认，在美国到达服役年龄的青年中，由于体力、智力不合兵役标准而不能服役的人数又不断增加。据他向美国众议院说，到今年四月三十日为止，由于健康、心理及其他原因而不合兵役标准的人达百分之四十五之多。而且新兵必须要经过一定时期的训练，这就不得不从国内仅剩的
    一点现役正规部队中再分出一部分力量来担任训练工作。这样，就进一步削弱了本来已经为了补充在朝鲜的伤亡而抽调了大批人员的这些正规部队的实力。美联社华盛顿十一月二十二日电已经承认：抽调的结果，留在美国的某些部队已经“只剩下一个空架子”。美联社的消息指出，人员的不足在最有决定作用的兵种陆军和海军陆战队中特别严重。同时，由于不断征调新兵以及在拉得很长的战线上部队更迭的频繁，还发生另外一个严重问题，就是大量的人员实际上不起作用。据美联社估计，美国“陆军经常有三分之一左右的人员或是在受训，或是在从一个基地到另一基地的实际旅程中”。
    特别困难的还有军官问题。有训练的军官的减少
    以及军官后备人员的缺乏使得整个军队的发展和战
    斗力受到巨大限制。美联社透露美国军队军官缺乏
    的情形说：“由于军官名额减少了一万三千名，使
    得军官训练计划也大加削减。士兵中本来可以进军
    官候补学校的名额也减少了一半。此外，最近从后
    备军官训练团出来的毕业生，在今后一段时期内将
    担任临时性工作，也只能暂缓担任实际工作。”美国
    兵力不足的现实注定了它继续侵朝战争必将遭受更
    大的失败。
