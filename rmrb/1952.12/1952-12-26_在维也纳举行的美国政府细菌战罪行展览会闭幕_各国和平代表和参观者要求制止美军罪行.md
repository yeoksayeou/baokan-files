    [Xinhua News Agency, Vienna] The US Government Germ Warfare Crimes Exhibition in Vienna, which opened on December 15th, has seen an increasing number of visitors each day. By the time the exhibition closed on the 19th, delegates from various countries attending the World People's Peace Congress had visited, as well as many citizens of Vienna.
    Visitors paid great attention to the evidence displayed at the exhibition of US military germ warfare crimes in Korea and Northeast China. They carefully listened to the recordings of captured American airmen confessing to dropping germ bombs.
    After seeing the exhibition, peace delegates from various countries and people from all walks of life in Vienna expressed their indignation at the heinous crimes of the US military. Those who had previously been misled by the lies of the bourgeois press recognized the truth from the exhibition and believed that action must be taken to stop this inhuman crime. In the large guestbook, an engineer wrote: "We cannot help but feel strong anger at these facts. We must use pressure to prohibit the use of weapons of mass slaughter of mankind. This is our task. In order to stop the continuation of this war, we vow to do everything in our power to make our Western brothers understand that if they do not rise up against such a war, they will suffer this terror..." After seeing the exhibition, an old lady from Vienna took out a photograph of her son, who had died in World War II, and said with tears in her eyes: "We must stop this crime."

    在维也纳举行的美国政府细菌战罪行展览会闭幕
    各国和平代表和参观者要求制止美军罪行
    【新华社维也纳讯】美国政府细菌战罪行展览会自十二月十五日在维也纳揭幕以来，参观者一天比一天增多，至十九日展览会闭幕为止，参加世界人民和平大会的各国代表们都已去参观过，维也纳的许多市民也都前往参观过。
    参观者都以极大注意参观了会上陈列的美军在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的罪证，他们都仔细地听了被俘美国空军供认投掷细菌弹的录音。
    各国和平代表与维也纳各界人士在看过展览会以后，都对美军的这种滔天罪行表示愤慨。那些过去曾被资产阶级报纸的谎言所蒙蔽的人，从展览会认识了事实的真相，并认为必须采取行动来制止这种灭绝人性的罪行。在巨册的留言簿上，一位工程师写道：“对于这些事实我们不能不感到强烈的愤怒，我们必需使用压力，以禁止使用大规模屠杀人类的武器，这是我们的任务。为了要制止这个战争的继续进行，我们誓以全力使西方的弟兄们知道：如果他们不起来反对这样的战争，他们将身罹这种恐怖……。”维也纳的一位老太太在看了展览会之后，掏出她的在第二次世界大战中牺牲了的儿子的像片流着泪说：“我们一定要制止这种罪行。”
