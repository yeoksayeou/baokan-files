    Judicial Reform Movement Changes the Face of the Buteha Banner People's Court

    Comrade Editor: The People's Court of Buteha Banner in Inner Mongolia has consistently held old legal views and old judicial styles such as "sitting in court to hear cases" and "not handling cases unless sued" since its establishment. After the judicial reform movement, these situations have been basically eliminated. During the judicial reform movement, in addition to clearing up delayed and unresolved cases and correcting past errors in the handling of certain cases, the court also formed several working groups to take turns "carrying small burdens" (bringing case materials) to the countryside to clear up accumulated cases. The first group to go to the countryside relied on the masses. Through individual visits, informal discussions, and group discussions, they handled thirteen cases in a few days and learned about many problems. Some villagers reflected: "This is great! The court is coming to our door to handle affairs!" Others said: "In the past, when filing a lawsuit, you had to look at the cadres' faces first. Now you can say whatever you want, and problems are really solved." When the working group arrived in Nutuk in the border area, they discovered a divorce case that should have been decided long ago, but the court did not allow the divorce in the past, causing both parties to suffer and lose enthusiasm for labor. After this inspection, they were granted a divorce. The villagers reflected: "This is the right thing to do! Otherwise, they would have been at odds for the rest of their lives." Also, a young Mongolian couple voluntarily requested to marry, but the village cadres did not act in accordance with the Marriage Law, preventing them from marrying and saying that they were "corrupt" and should be "dealt with." This time, the working group explained the Marriage Law in detail in the village, and the relevant village cadres made a self-criticism. They were happily married. Through such problem-solving, the relationship between the court and the masses has become closer. When the working group left the village, the villagers all said: "You must come often!" The cadres of the working group received practical education in their work in the countryside, and now they are more active and enthusiastic in their work. Clerk Ren Shouxin said: "In the past, I was afraid of going to the countryside. From now on, I will do whatever I am asked to do." Judge Wang Zhengpu, who had just returned from working in the countryside, learned that a divorce case needed to be dealt with promptly. He did not hesitate to ask to handle it himself. Early the next morning, he braved the heavy snow to travel more than a hundred miles to handle the divorce case. This is the new atmosphere of the Buteha Banner People's Court, and it is also why the villagers feel that "this is truly the people's court."

    司法改革运动使布特哈旗人民法院改变了面貌
    编辑同志：内蒙古布特哈旗人民法院，自成立以来一贯有着旧法观点和“坐堂问案”、“不告不理”等旧司法作风。经过司法改革运动，这些情况基本上被肃清了。司法改革运动中，该院除了清理拖延未决的案件和纠正过去对某些案件的错误处理外，还组成若干工作小组轮流“背小包袱”（带案件材料）下乡清理积案。第一次下乡工作的小组依靠群众，经过个别访问、漫谈、讨论等，在几天内就处理了十三个案件，并了解了许多问题。有的老乡反映：“这回好啦！法院上咱们门来办事啦！”或说：“过去打官司，先要看干部脸，现在有啥说啥，真解决问题。”当工作小组到边区努图克时，发现一件早就应该判决离婚的案子，但过去法院不让离，以致双方都痛苦，劳动不起劲。这次检查后，给他们判离了。老乡反映：“这样才对呀！不然他俩蹩扭一辈子。”又有一对蒙族青年男女自动要求结婚，但村干部不按婚姻法办事，阻止他俩结婚，并且说他俩“腐化”，要“处理”他俩。这一次，工作小组在该村详细讲解了婚姻法，有关村干部作了检讨，他俩圆满地结婚了。通过这样的处理问题，法院和群众的关系密切起来了。当工作小组离开该村时，老乡们都说：“你们可要常来呵！”工作小组的干部们在下乡工作中，受到了实际的教育，现在工作更积极、热情了。书记员任守信说：“过去我怕下乡，今后要我干啥我干啥。”学习审判员王正普刚下乡工作回来，知道有一件离婚案须及时处理，他毫不犹豫地要求由他去办。第二天一早，他便冒着大雪到一百多里地外去处理那离婚案。这是布特哈旗人民法院的新气象，也是老乡们感到“这真是人民法院”的原因。    彭恩淇
