Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th: TASS reported from Berlin on the 11th: "German News Agency" reported: The U.S. occupation authorities in Germany have printed a booklet entitled "Bacteriological Warfare Handbook." This booklet has been issued as an instruction to the West German Civil Defense Association. This booklet is tantamount to an official confirmation of the fact that the U.S. aggressor troops have been conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. The booklet says: Although bacteriological warfare has not been carried out on a large scale, such attempts have been made in a smaller area. The booklet openly admits that the United States is very familiar with the types and effects of bacteriological weapons. The methods of bacteriological warfare described in the booklet coincide exactly with the results of past investigations into the crimes of the U.S. aggressor troops in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

"German News Agency" then recounted some facts proving that West Germany is actively preparing for bacteriological warfare.

Bonn Chancellor Adenauer stated in the Federal Parliament on December 6 that, according to the Bonn and Paris war treaties, West Germany will produce weapons of mass destruction such as bacteriological and chemical weapons in the area west of the Rhine.

The U.S. Seventh Army stationed in Germany established a school in Wellershof near Kirchheim-Bolanden last summer, specializing in training U.S. troops in the use of bacteriological weapons.

The U.S. military headquarters in Heidelberg also said that in one year, more than 22,000 U.S. officers and soldiers stationed in West Germany have learned methods of conducting bacteriological warfare.

Under the direction of Ridgway, the department of Blank, the future Minister of the Army of West Germany, has begun to register former military chemists and bacteriologists residing in West Germany. They will first study special courses at the U.S. occupation army chemical laboratory in Hanau, and then be incorporated into special units of the "European Army."

Fischer, the head of civil defense in Schleswig-Holstein, proved in a conversation published in June this year that the West German Civil Defense Association is also preparing for bacteriological warfare.

Around June this year, news said that West Germany had established several secret research centers preparing for bacteriological warfare, and had been working intensively for several months. These secret research centers include the Bernhard-Groe Institute in Hamburg, the Farben Industry Hygiene Institute in Wuppertal, the National Medical Institute in Luneburg, and the National Research Laboratory in Freiburg-Breisgau.

British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Anthony Nutting, said in mid-February this year that the Adenauer government must be allowed to conduct research on bacteriological warfare, and said that this issue had been discussed in negotiations between Adenauer and the foreign ministers of Western countries.

    美国驻德占领当局印发的“细菌战须知”小册子
    证实美国侵略军在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行
    同时暴露美军和阿登纳傀儡正加紧准备细菌战
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社柏林十一日讯：“德意志通讯社”报道：美国驻德占领当局印行了一种题为“细菌战须知”的小册子。这个小册子已经作为一个指示发给西德防空协会。这本小册子就等于官方证实了美国侵略军在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实。这本小册子说：虽然细菌战没有大规模地进行过，但是在一个较小的地区内已经作过这种尝试。小册子公然承认，美国非常熟习细菌武器的类型和效果。小册子里面描述的细菌战的方法，与过去调查美国侵略军在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的罪行的结果正好相符。
    “德意志通讯社”继而追述一些事实，证明西德正积极进行细菌战的准备工作。
    波恩总理阿登纳曾在十二月六日在联邦议院中发表声明说：按照波恩和巴黎战争条约，西德将在莱茵河以西的地区生产细菌武器和化学武器等大批屠杀人民的武器。
    驻德美国占领军第七军去年夏天在吉尔希海姆—波兰敦附近的威尔斯哈德建立了一所专门训练美军使用细菌武器的学校。
    海得尔堡的美军总部也说，在一年中，有二万二千多名驻西德的美国官兵学习了进行细菌战的方法。
    在李奇微的指示下，西德未来陆军部长布兰克的部门已开始登记居住在西德的前军事化学家与细菌学家。他们将首先在哈诺的美国占领军化学实验所中学习特别课程，然后编入“欧洲军”的特别部队。
    石勒苏益格—荷兰斯泰恩州防空首脑费希尔在今年六月发表的谈话中证明，西德防空协会也在进行细菌战准备工作。
    约在今年六月，就有消息说西德已成立了几个准备细菌战的秘密研究中心，并且已经紧张地工作了好几个月了。这些秘密研究中心包括汉堡的勃恩哈特—戈勒研究所、窝伯塔尔的法本工业卫生研究所、鲁尼堡的国立医学研究所与夫赖堡—勃莱斯高的国立研究实验所。
    英国外交部驻议会次官安东尼·纳丁在今年二月中说，必须允许阿登纳政府进行细菌战方面的研究工作，并说，在阿登纳与西方国家外交部长谈判中就曾经讨论过这个问题。
