    Curing the River and Driving Away the Days of Suffering
    Comrade Editor: I am a farmer from Mazhuang Township near Huayuankou. Our township was flooded for eight full years by the Yellow River water released by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Seven out of the fourteen villages in the township were washed away. The number of people who starved to death at that time was truly countless; Shaoqiao Village, which had more than 100 households, now has only fourteen or fifteen households left. In 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the American devils colluded again to release water to flood the liberated areas, and only then did they block the breach here. When the villagers returned, they built thatched huts and cultivated small patches of sandy wasteland. The grain harvested was not even enough to pay the taxes, military rations, and landlords' rent to the Kuomintang reactionaries. Our life at that time was just like what a song at that time said: "Wild vegetables are bitter and astringent, the disaster victims' life-saving food; there is still half a measure of rice at home, every grain is paid to the 'plundering party'."
    The ten years of life before liberation were as hard to bear as a hundred years. But the three and a half years after liberation have passed in the blink of an eye. We have taken back the land from the landlords and are no longer exploited by them. The People's Government not only has no exorbitant taxes and levies, but also reduced and exempted our public grain, and provided loans to help us restore production. The mutual aid team I lead received various loans of 660 jin of grain and 220,000 yuan in Renminbi last year alone. Now, the number of livestock in our team has doubled compared to before liberation, and all the large and small farm tools have been acquired. Although this year's wheat suffered from drought, the average yield per mu has more than doubled compared to the past. What makes us most grateful is that the People's Government has led us to control the water disasters of the big and small rivers, protect our good crops, and protect our good life. We have carefully repaired the Yellow River embankment like our own children. In addition to raising, thickening, and repairing dangerous sections every year, we have also planted willow forests on the back of the river. The Yellow River has not caused harm for three years. The embankment of the Jialu River, which was silted up by the Yellow River water, has also been restored, and the riverbed has been deepened. A huge flood control organization has been established, and almost all men and women of the young and middle-aged have participated; once the flood season arrives, our Zheng County Second District alone has a flood control team of more than 5,000 people on the embankment, and we will block even the biggest flood.
    Every time I stand on the embankment and look at the lush crops, I think: "Without Chairman Mao, where would our home be?"

    治好河流赶走苦难的日子
    编辑同志：我是花园口附近马庄乡的一个农民。我们乡被国民党反动派放的黄水整整淹了八年。全乡十四个村被水冲了七个。当时饿死的人真是数也数不清，一百多户人家的邵桥村现在只剩下十四五户了。一九四七年国民党反动派和美国鬼子又合计着放水淹解放区，才在我们这里堵上口，乡亲们回来，搭起茅庵，垦种着一小片沙荒地，收获的粮食还不够缴给国民党反动派的税捐、军粮和地主的租子。我们那时的生活正像当时的一首歌所说的：“野菜苦又涩，灾民救命粮；家里还有半合米，粒粒缴给‘刮民党’”。
    解放前的十年生活，简直像一百年那样的难熬。可是解放后的三年半，却在一眨眼的功夫过去了。我们从地主手里收回了土地，再不受地主的剥削了。人民政府不但没有苛捐杂税，还减免了我们的公粮，并贷放粮款帮助我们恢复生产。我领导的互助组去年一年得到各种贷款就有粮食六百六十斤、人民币二十二万元。现在，我们组的牲口比解放前增加了一倍，大小农具也都置齐了。今年的麦子虽然受了旱，每亩平均产量还比过去提高了一倍多。最使我们感激的，是人民政府领导我们治服了大河小河的水患，保卫了我们的好庄稼，保卫了我们的好生活。我们像对自己孩子一样细致地修整了黄河大堤，除了年年加高培厚修理险工外，背河面还植上柳林。黄河三年没有为害了。被黄水淤平了的贾鲁河的河堤也修复了，河身挖深了。一个巨大的防汛组织成立起来了，男女青壮年几乎都已参加；一到汛期，单我们郑县二区就有五千多人的防汛队上堤，再大的洪水我们也要把它挡住。
    每当我立在堤上，看着一片丰茂的庄稼，就想到：“没有毛主席，那里有我们的家园。”河南治淮劳动模范　马瑞合
