Xinhua News Agency, Korean Kimhwa Front, December 14th: A report from our front-line correspondent: The battle in the Shangganling area has ended victoriously. Except for a platoon's forward position on the north mountain of Hill 537.7, which is still being contested, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops have recovered all the positions and strengthened their fortifications. The positions held by the heroes are now more consolidated than ever.

On the snowy evening of December 1st, the Volunteer Army units that participated in the glorious battle in the Shangganling area held a celebration and gathering. Those commanders and fighters as strong as steel gathered in the rear near the front lines. The unprecedentedly fierce battle of forty-six days had added a few wrinkles to their foreheads and left red streaks in their eyes; but they were victors, celebrating with pride and joy. An infinitely excited voice echoed in the venue: "We have won!"

Units are currently assessing merits and offering congratulations. Commanders and fighters demonstrated exceptional bravery in this battle. According to rough statistics, four thousand heroes and role models have emerged. This includes Huang Jiguang, a hero in the style of Matrosov who was famous throughout the army from the beginning of the battle, and Yi Caixue, a resourceful and courageous soldier. They enjoy high honor and have become role models for the entire army to emulate. Many heroes are rushing around, introducing valuable combat experience to various units, and they have been widely and warmly welcomed.

Military, political, and logistics organs of the various arms of the Volunteer Army that participated in the Battle of Shangganling are holding intensive meetings to summarize a series of rich experiences in blocking, counterattacking, tunnel warfare, infantry-artillery coordination, communication and liaison, and transportation. These experiences are of great significance to the entire army.

The post-battle reorganization work is nearing completion, and the combat troops have received strong support from fraternal units and logistics units. The soldiers on the Shangganling battlefield are rebuilding their dugout homes. They have built heated *kangs* (platforms for sleeping) in the tunnels, and installed plank doors or straw curtains at the tunnel entrances. They sit by the warm charcoal fire, some eating apples sent by the Korean people to express gratitude, reading letters of appreciation from the people of the motherland, and some reading the front-line mimeographed newspapers. When they read the glorious deeds of heroes such as Huang Jiguang and Yi Caixue broadcast by this news agency, the soldiers erupted in cheers. A large number of paper, textbooks, and stationery have been transported to the front lines to meet the soldiers' needs for cultural learning. A large number of gongs, drums, and carom boards have also been transported to the front lines. Literary and art workers are going deep into the units to collect heroic deeds, preparing to compile various literary and performance programs.

Now, white snow covers the Shangganling battlefield, covering the deformed hills and broken enemy corpses bombarded by artillery fire. The Volunteer Army is becoming more active. Commanders and fighters are welcoming 1953 – a year that will bring greater victory – with the joyful mood of achieving a glorious victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 16th: Fighting on the Western Front was relatively intense in the week from December 6th to 12th. Late at night on the 10th, our army launched a counterattack against four positions of the ROK First Division northwest of Lianchuan. Two of the positions were evacuated immediately after being captured. The other two positions – Yuxian Nanshan and Shuiyu City Beishan – remain under our control after two days of fighting. From the beginning of the counterattack until the 12th, our army has eliminated more than 1,100 enemy soldiers.

During the day on the 11th, the enemy simultaneously launched counterattacks against Yuxian Nanshan and Shuiyu City Beishan, but were repelled. That night, the enemy shelled Shuiyu City Beishan all night. At dawn on the 12th, they began to concentrate all their strength to launch a counterattack. On this day, the enemy shelled this small hill with more than 40,000 rounds of artillery shells, and deployed more than 40 tanks and 55 aircraft sorties. In nearly ten hours, the enemy launched continuous attacks, each time with more than four platoons, as many as ten times. The main peak changed hands six times. Our defending troops launched six counterattacks, and at dusk finally repelled two companies of enemy soldiers counterattacking from the front and flanks, regaining all positions. After a day of fierce fighting, our army eliminated most of an enemy battalion, totaling more than 500 soldiers, and destroyed two enemy heavy tanks.

During this week, there were intermittent small-scale battles on the ridges to the left of Shangganling. From the 6th to the 9th, our army repelled two harassing attacks by small enemy units. Late at night on the 6th, our army once raided enemy positions, destroying five bunkers, and repelled an enemy counterattack, eliminating more than 20 enemy soldiers. After the 9th, the fighting subsided.

In other areas of the front, small-scale battles such as ambushes and raids were relatively frequent, especially on the Western Front. During the week, our army repelled more than ten enemy harassing attacks. In the central region, our army ambushed the enemy near Jiaqili, northeast of Tieyuan, at noon on the 9th, and engaged the enemy in a fierce ten-minute battle, eliminating more than 40 American soldiers.

During this week, our army's mobile artillery fire killed or wounded more than 1,000 enemy soldiers at the front. Our army's front-line anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down 20 enemy aircraft and damaged 54 enemy aircraft.

    【新华社朝鲜金化前线十四日电】本社前线记者报道：上甘岭地区的战役胜利结束了。现在除了五三七点七高地北山上还有一个排的前沿阵地在继续争夺以外，中国人民志愿军部队已经收复了所有的阵地，并在这些阵地上加强了工事。英雄们扼守的阵地比过去更加巩固了。
    在十二月一日大雪纷飞的晚上，参加上甘岭地区光辉战役的志愿军部队举行了祝捷联欢大会。那些像钢铁般坚强的指挥员、战斗员们欢聚在接近火线的后方，四十六天空前激烈的战斗使他们的额上添了几道皱纹，眼睛里留下了红丝；但是他们是胜利者，他们带着自豪和愉快的心情而狂欢。会场上回荡着一个无限兴奋的声音：“我们胜利了！”
    各参战部队正在评功、贺功。指挥员、战斗员们在这次战役中表现了特殊的英勇，据粗略统计，已经涌现出四千位英雄模范。其中包括战役初期就盛传全军的马特洛索夫式的英雄黄继光、智勇双全的战士易才学……，他们享有崇高的荣誉，成为全军学习的榜样。许多英雄正在到处奔忙，向各部队介绍宝贵的作战经验，他们受到了广泛的热烈的欢迎。
    参加上甘岭战役的各兵种部队的军事、政治、后勤等机关，正在紧张地举行会议，总结阻击、反击、坑道斗争、步炮协同、通信联络、运输等一系列的丰富经验。这些经验对全军都有重大意义。
    战后的整顿工作即将完成，作战部队得到了兄弟部队和后勤部队的大力支援。上甘岭战场上的战士们正在重建自己的阵地之家。他们在坑道里筑了暖炕，坑道口装上了板门或草帘。他们坐在暖烘烘的炭火边，有的吃着朝鲜人民慰劳的苹果，读着祖国人民写来的慰问信，有的在读前线出版的油印报纸。当读到本社广播的英雄黄继光、易才学等的光辉事迹时，战士们发出了一阵欢呼。大批纸张、课本、文具已经运到前线，满足战士们学习文化的需要。大批锣鼓、康乐球等文娱工具也运到了前线。文艺工作人员们正深入部队搜集英雄事迹，准备编写各种文艺演唱节目。
    现在白雪覆盖着上甘岭战场，覆盖着被炮火轰得变了形的山岗和破碎的敌军尸体。志愿军更加活跃起来，指挥员、战斗员们正以取得辉煌胜利的愉快心情迎接一九五三年——这个将要带来更大胜利的一年。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】十二月六日到十二日一周间，西线的战斗比较激烈。十日深夜，我军向涟川西北间李伪军第一师的四个阵地发起反击，其中两处阵地在攻占后即撤离，另两处阵地——榆岘南山和水郁市北山，经过两天争夺，仍为我控制。我军从反击战开始到十二日为止，已歼敌一千一百多名。
    十一日白天，敌人同时向榆岘南山和水郁市北山反扑，都被击退。这天夜里，敌人向水郁市北山打了一夜炮，十二日黎明又开始集中全力进行反扑。这一天，敌人向这个小山岭炮击四万多发，并出动坦克四十多辆，飞机五十五架次。在将近十个钟头内，敌人每次用四个多排的兵力连续攻击十次之多，主峰曾易手六次。我军守备部队曾进行六次反击，在黄昏时分终将从正面和侧翼反扑的两个连的敌人击退，夺回全部阵地。激战一天，我军歼敌一个营的大部，计五百多名；击毁敌军重型坦克二辆。
    这一周中上甘岭左边山岭仍有时断时续的小规模战斗。六日到九日，我军击退敌人小部队的两次袭扰。六日夜深，我军一度袭入敌人阵地，击毁地堡五个，并击退敌人反扑，歼敌二十多名。九日以后，战事沉寂。
    前线其他地区，袭击、伏击等小规模战斗比较频繁，尤以西线为多，一周中我军曾击退敌人十多次袭扰。中线我军九日午后在铁原东北加七里附近设伏，与敌激战十分钟，歼灭美军四十多名。
    在这一周中，前线我军游动炮火击毙击伤敌军一千多名；我军前线高射炮火击落敌机二十架，击伤敌机五十四架。
