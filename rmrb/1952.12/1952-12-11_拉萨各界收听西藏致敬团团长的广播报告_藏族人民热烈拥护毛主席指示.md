Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th. The broadcast report to the Tibetan local government's monk and lay officials and Tibetan compatriots by Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabah, head of the Tibet Tribute Delegation, on the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing, has been warmly welcomed by the people of all circles in Lhasa. When the Central People's Broadcasting Station announced the broadcast program of Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabah, those who heard the announcement spread the word and prepared to listen. On that day, all radios in Lhasa City listened to this report. Many people also held symposiums to discuss the report.

Officials, both monks and laymen, of the Tibetan local government have successively made speeches supporting Chairman Mao's instructions. Chijiang Living Buddha, the scripture teacher of the Dalai Lama of the Tibetan local government, said in his speech: "Chairman Mao's instructions are very precious to the Tibetan people. Chairman Mao is the sun for all ethnic groups, bringing warmth and happiness to the Tibetan people." He said: "Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabah represents our Tibetan people in meeting Chairman Mao and receiving a warm welcome from the Central People's Government and all fraternal ethnic groups. This is a powerful manifestation of the great unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland and also the glory of our Tibetan people." Chijiang Living Buddha concluded by saying: "I will definitely report Chairman Mao's instructions well to the Dalai Lama." Gaza Dundrup, an official of the Tibetan local government, said: "In the future, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and unite more closely with the People's Liberation Army to strive for the thorough implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the construction of a new Tibet in the motherland."

The lamas of the three major monasteries in Tibet were extremely grateful after hearing Chairman Mao's talk. Geshe Nishi Longdeng of Drepung Monastery, one of the three major monasteries, said:
"I am extremely happy after hearing Chairman Mao's instructions. In the past, imperialists spread rumors, insisting that the Communist Party was eliminating Buddhism, but in the past year, we have been getting along very well with the People's Liberation Army, and their actual actions have completely shattered these rumors. Today, Chairman Mao has once again clearly instructed on the policy of protecting religion. On behalf of all the lamas in Tibet, I sincerely thank our leader, Chairman Mao."

People from cultural and educational circles in Lhasa City spoke at the symposium, expressing their support and gratitude for Chairman Mao's instructions. Tudeng Nima, a Tibetan language teacher at the Tibet Military Region Cadre School, said: "Today, after hearing Chairman Mao's instructions and the construction situation in the interior of the motherland in Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabah's broadcast, I have a clearer understanding of the happy future of the Tibetan people." Zhuosang Jianzan, a teacher at Lhasa City Primary School, said: "Every word of Chairman Mao's instructions is very cordial to us. Chairman Mao's words really speak to the hearts of our Tibetan people."

People from all walks of life in Tibet unanimously requested the Tibetan "News Brief" to convey Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabah's broadcast text to the people of the entire Tibet, so that every monk and layman in Tibet can know Chairman Mao's instructions.

    拉萨各界收听西藏致敬团团长的广播报告
    藏族人民热烈拥护毛主席指示
    【新华社拉萨十日电】西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴在北京中央人民广播电台对西藏地方政府僧俗官员和西藏僧俗同胞的广播报告，受到拉萨市各阶层僧俗人民的热烈欢迎。当中央人民广播电台预告柳霞·土登塔巴的广播节目时，听到预告的人便奔走相告，准备收听。当天，拉萨市所有的收音机都收听了这个报告。很多人并开座谈会讨论了这个报告。
    西藏地方政府僧俗官员纷纷发表谈话，拥护毛主席的指示。西藏地方政府达赖喇嘛的经师赤江活佛在谈话中说：“毛主席的指示，对西藏人民是非常宝贵的，毛主席是各族人民的太阳，使西藏人民得到了温暖和幸福。”他说：“柳霞·土登塔巴代表我们藏族人民谒见了毛主席，并受到中央人民政府和各兄弟民族的热烈欢迎，这是祖国各族人民大团结的有力表现，也是我们西藏人民的光荣。”赤江活佛最后说：“我一定把毛主席的指示很好地报告给达赖喇嘛。”西藏地方政府官员噶须顿珠说：“今后我们一定按照毛主席的指示，和人民解放军更紧密地团结在一起，为彻底实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议与建设祖国的新西藏而奋斗。”
    西藏三大寺的喇嘛们听到了毛主席的谈话更是万分感激。三大寺之一的哲蚌寺的格西尼喜龙登说：
    “听了毛主席的指示，我真是高兴极了。过去帝国主义者造谣，硬说共产党消灭佛教，可是一年来我们和人民解放军相处得很好，他们的实际行动已经把这些谣言彻底粉碎了。今天毛主席又明确地指示了保护宗教的政策，我代表西藏所有的喇嘛衷心感谢我们的领袖毛主席。”
    拉萨市文化教育界人士在座谈会上纷纷发言，表示他们对毛主席指示的拥护和感激。西藏军区干部学校藏文教员土登尼马说：“今天在柳霞·土登塔巴广播中，听到了毛主席的指示和祖国内地的建设情况后，使我更清楚地认识了西藏人民的幸福的前途。”拉萨市小学校教员诼桑坚赞说：“毛主席指示我们的每一句话，对我们都非常亲切，毛主席的话真是说到我们藏族人民的心里了。”
    西藏各阶层人民一致要求藏文“新闻简讯”社把柳霞·土登塔巴的广播文，传达给全西藏的人民，使西藏的每一个僧俗人民都能够知道毛主席的指示。
