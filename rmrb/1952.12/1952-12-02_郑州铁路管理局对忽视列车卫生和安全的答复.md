    Zhengzhou Railway Administration's Reply Regarding Negligence of Train Hygiene and Safety

    Editor: The criticisms raised by Comrade Ding Bo in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on October 27th regarding our train hygiene and safety work are correct. Except for Train No. 105, which belongs to the Tianjin Railway Administration and we have already informed them to improve it, after our investigation of Train No. 255 and Train No. 244, it is indeed true that the cleaning system was not thoroughly implemented, which affected train hygiene. This is a manifestation of our insufficient work and inadequate education of the train crew. Recently, we have dispatched inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections and corrections. As for the issue of Train No. 244 lacking windshield equipment, due to the limitations of the vehicle structure, we have reported this matter to the Ministry of Railways for consideration and improvement. 　Zhengzhou Railway Administration

    郑州铁路管理局对忽视列车卫生和安全的答复
    编辑同志：十月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏中，丁波同志对我列车卫生和安全工作，提出的批评，是正确的。除一○五次列车是天津铁路管理局的列车，我们已函告他们改进外，二五五次列车，二四四次列车，经我们调查，确实没有彻底执行清扫制度，因而影响列车卫生。这是我们工作不深入，对乘务人员教育不够的表现。最近我们已派出检查组，深入检查纠正。至于二四四次列车无风挡设备问题，因限于车辆构造，我们已把此事报告给铁道部考虑改进。　郑州铁路管理局
