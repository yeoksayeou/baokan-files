In order to welcome the large-scale basic construction next year, various basic construction units in Taiyuan City are actively carrying out comprehensive preparation work.

Taiyuan City is a heavy industrial city in North China. Next year's basic construction tasks will be more than double that of this year. This year's basic construction projects started late due to the "Three-Anti" movement, so there was a phenomenon of rushing into battle, being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end in basic construction. Learning from this lesson, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government held two basic construction meetings in September and October, successively, and determined important plans for design, construction, labor organization, material supply, and transportation based on the 1953 construction tasks, and specifically assigned tasks. Subsequently, each unit held professional meetings separately and formulated specific plans. After summarizing the experience and lessons learned from crude and shoddy design work caused by the lack of planning in the past, the Taiyuan City Design Company organized the design forces of seven units, including the Shanxi Provincial Design Company and the Civil Engineering Department of Shanxi University, unified the calculation standards for wood structure and reinforced concrete projects in the city, and began to design projects to be started in the first quarter of next year.

In order to effectively overcome the supply system mentality and capitalist business management methods in basic construction work, the construction units are conducting asset liquidation and capital verification work, and are summarizing this year's construction experience and formulating plans to rectify the institutions based on the principles of enterprise management and factory-like site management. At present, the work of fixing workers has been basically completed in each unit. According to incomplete statistics, more than 11,400 temporary workers in the city have been fixed as long-term industrial workers, and seasonal contracts have been signed with a large number of workers. A large number of dormitories and auditoriums have been built, and preparations are being made for training in the winter. The Taiyuan Municipal Labor Liaison Office evaluated the technical grades of more than 6,600 skilled workers before the shutdown, thoroughly clarifying the technical level of construction workers in Taiyuan City. The office is now reviewing the plans of each unit to employ workers next year; if the number of people is insufficient, it is prepared to allocate them from various special districts. In order to replenish the basic construction institutions, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is now transferring cadres to various departments. Recently, the Third Engineering Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government alone has added more than 100 cadres. The Taiyuan Municipal Administrative Cadre School has added an engineering class since the first half of this year to train junior technical cadres. The first batch of more than 80 graduates have been assigned to various construction units as trainees. The school has now added three more classes, totaling 250 people. This group of students will graduate around the Qingming Festival next year. In addition, each unit has formulated a plan for training cadres. Shanxi Engineering Construction Company is preparing to select a group of excellent skilled workers for special training so that they can be promoted to cadres in the future.

Strengthening the political, cultural, and technical study of fixed workers and improving the professional and technical level of management cadres and engineering technicians are the main contents of winter preparation work. The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government issued instructions on winter training work on November 20, instructing all units to organize winter training working committees and prepare to start training universally in early December. The purpose of workers' winter training is to improve their political awareness, summarize and learn from advanced experience, and make ideological and technical preparations for large-scale basic construction next year. Units such as the Taiyuan City Design Company have already planned and organized spare-time training classes for engineering technicians and management cadres to study courses such as construction management, general mechanics, Soviet reinforced concrete structures, and Russian. This method of learning and applying has played a huge role in the Third Engineering Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building. When the bureau was established at the beginning of last year (at that time, it was originally under the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry), it lacked technical personnel, so it recruited a group of high school students who did not understand technology for training. After several months of spare-time study, they have completed the second-year college courses, and many comrades have now served as the main technical personnel in the work areas. This winter, each unit will also organize professional training classes for management cadres and grassroots trade union cadres. The city is preparing to organize personnel from administrative management, Party committees, trade unions, Communist Youth League, engineering technology, and other aspects to visit Beijing and the Northeast in a planned manner to learn from the advanced experience of various places.

The preparation of building materials, transportation, and water and electricity supply is also underway. Taiyuan City Equipment Company is expanding its organization and adding equipment. The company has ordered 22 large and small brick-making machines and is preparing to open two rubble yards. According to this year's experience, the Transportation Company is scientifically allocating transportation forces to ensure the supply of materials. The company is now working to improve the professional division of labor for loading, unloading, and transportation, vigorously organizing the families of employees to participate in loading and unloading, and preparing to convert a portion of rickshaws into small handcarts in a planned manner, concentrating all efforts to serve basic construction. In order to supply water for basic construction next year, the Taiyuan City Water Company is now connecting water pipes to the dormitory work area near Jianziwan outside the East Gate and is digging two water wells in the western suburbs to ensure a daily water supply of 3,000 tons.

### 太原市全面准备明年基本建设工作

    太原市全面准备明年基本建设工作
    为了迎接明年大规模的基本建设，太原市各基本建设单位正在积极进行全面准备工作。
    太原市是华北的一个重工业城市，明年基本建设任务比今年增加一倍多。今年的基本建设工程因进行“三反”运动，开工较迟，所以基本建设中有匆忙应战、前松后紧的现象。接受这一教训，太原市人民政府在九、十两月，先后召开了两次基本建设会议，根据一九五三年建设任务，确定了设计、施工、劳动力组织以及材料供应、运输等重要方案，并具体分配了任务。接着，各单位都分别召开了专业会议，订出具体计划。太原市设计公司总结了过去因为无计划而造成设计工作上的粗制滥造的经验教训后，组织了山西省设计公司、山西大学土木系等七个单位的设计力量，统一了全市的木结构、钢筋混凝土等工程的计算标准，开始进行明年第一季度开工工程的设计工作。
    为了有效地克服基本建设工作中供给制思想和资本主义经营管理方法，各施工单位正在进行清理资产、核定资金工作，并根据经营管理企业化、工地管理工厂化的原则，总结今年施工经验，订出整顿机构计划。现在各单位固定工人工作已基本结束。据不完全统计，全市有一万一千四百多名临时工人固定为长期产业工人，并和大批工人订了季节合同，修建了大批宿舍和礼堂，准备在冬季进行训练。太原市劳动联络处在停工前就评定了六千六百多个技术工人的技术等级，彻底弄清了太原市建筑工人的技术水平。该处现在正在审查各单位明年雇用工人的计划；人数不足时，准备从各专区调配。为了充实基本建设机构，中共太原市委现正在抽调干部给各部门。最近只是中央第二机械工业部第三工程处就增加了一百多个干部。太原市行政干部学校，从今年上半年起，增设一个工程班，培养初级技术干部，第一批毕业的八十多个学员已分配到各施工单位担任练习生职务。该校现在又增加了三个班，计二百五十人。这批学生将在明年清明节前后毕业。此外，各单位都定出培养干部计划。山西工程建筑公司准备挑选一批优秀技术工人，加以专门训练，以便将来提拔为干部。
    加强固定工人政治、文化、技术学习和提高管理干部、工程技术人员业务技术水平，是冬季准备工作的主要内容。太原市人民政府于十一月二十日发出了冬季训练工作的指示，指示各单位组织冬训工作委员会，准备十二月初普遍开始训练。工人冬季训练的目的在于提高他们的政治觉悟，总结和学习先进经验，为明年大规模基本建设作好思想准备和技术准备。太原市设计公司等单位，已有计划地组织了工程技术人员和管理干部的业余训练班，分别学习施工管理、普通力学、苏联钢筋混凝土结构、俄文等课程。这种边学边用的方法，在第二机械工业部第三工程处已经起了巨大作用。该处在去年初成立时（当时原属重工业部领导），技术人员不足，就招收一批不懂技术的高中学生加以培养。经过几个月的业余学习，已经学完大学二年级课程，有许多同志现在已担任了工区主要技术人员职务。各单位在今冬还组织管理干部、工会基层干部专业训练班。全市准备有计划地组织行政管理、党委、工会、青年团、工程技术等方面的人员去北京和东北参观，学习各地先进经验。
    建筑材料、搬运、及水电供应的准备工作也在紧张地进行中。太原市器材公司正在扩大机构，增添设备。该公司已定购了二十二部大小制砖机器，并准备开辟两个片石场。搬运公司根据今年的经验，科学地调配运输力量，以保证材料的供应。现在该公司正着手改进装卸和搬运的专业分工，大力组织职工家属参加装卸，并准备将一部分人力车有计划地转为小手车，集中一切力量为基本建设服务。太原市自来水公司为了供应明年基本建设用水，现在正向东门外剪子湾一带宿舍工区接水管，并在西郊打两个水井，保证每天有三千吨水量。（段涟）
