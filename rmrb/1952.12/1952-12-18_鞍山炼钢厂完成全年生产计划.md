    鞍山炼钢厂完成全年生产计划
    【新华社鞍山十七日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂职工已在十二月十日提前二十一天完成了全年的国家生产计划，实现了他们在十二月二日给毛主席报告创造炼钢全国新纪录的电报中所提出的保证。按照国家的要求，鞍山炼钢厂今年的炼钢任务比去年的实际产量增加了百分之三十五。一年来，在苏联专家热诚帮助下，炼钢厂先后推广了快速修补平炉、科学供热及下注钢锭等一系列的先进操作法，从而使钢的产量和质量都大为提高。今年鞍山炼钢厂钢的生产，在产量上不但超过了伪满统治时期最高水平的百分之三十三；优质钢的生产也由一九五○年的百分之五，提高到现在的百分之二十四点二。目前，鞍山炼钢厂全体职工又提出要在年底以前为国家炼出更大量的钢。
