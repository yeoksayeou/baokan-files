    Achievements in Financial and Economic Construction in Xinjiang Province over the Past Three Years
    By Saifuddin, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government

    It has been more than three years since Xinjiang was liberated. The achievements in Xinjiang's financial and economic construction over the past three years have been great and extremely significant. Anyone who lived in Xinjiang in the past can recall the broken and desolate scene of Xinjiang on the eve of liberation. Except for the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan, which were liberated in 1944 after the struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gang, the agricultural and pastoral production of the people of all ethnic groups was devastated, foreign trade was cut off, internal transportation was paralyzed, commerce was depressed, daily necessities were extremely scarce, the market was filled with counterfeit currency that was like waste paper, prices rose several times a day, and the people were impoverished and starving. Xinjiang's financial and economic situation was in a state of complete bankruptcy. In the three years since liberation, thanks to the correct implementation of the central government's ethnic policies and financial and economic policies by the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, the adoption of policies suitable for Xinjiang's specific circumstances, and the strong support of the people of the whole country for the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the chaos and bankruptcy of Xinjiang's finances and economy were quickly reversed, creating a new situation suitable for the recovery and development of production. At present, agricultural and pastoral production has been developed, prices have basically stabilized, the market is becoming increasingly prosperous and active, transportation has developed, and industrial construction has begun, so that Xinjiang, which has no modern industry, has begun to see large-scale modern factories. This has guaranteed the supply of means of livelihood and means of production for the people of all ethnic groups, and the people's lives have been initially improved.
    The great and significant achievements in Xinjiang's financial and economic construction in such a short period of three years are inseparable from the victories of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang on the military and production fronts. The Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has bravely suppressed bandits, stabilized social order, and achieved victories on the military front for the past three years; it has also taken the lead in production with selfless labor, giving full play to its high degree of creativity and initiative, and achieved victories on the production front. Without these, Xinjiang's financial and economic work would not have achieved what it has today. The contributions of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang to the people of Xinjiang are enormous, and therefore they have won the heartfelt support and love of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
    In summary, Xinjiang's financial and economic achievements over the past three years can be divided into the following points:
    1. Developed agricultural and pastoral production. After liberation, the People's Government carried out preliminary reforms in rural areas, adjusted land, implemented reasonable burdens, carried out mutual assistance and mutual borrowing, and then completed rent reduction and the fight against local bullies, and began land reform in agricultural areas, and agricultural production has been further developed. According to statistics: in 1950, the sown area of grain increased by 9.98 percent compared with 1949, and grain production increased by 19.56 percent; the cotton field expanded by 7.19 percent, and cotton production increased by 6.39 percent; the area of oil crops increased by 109.95 percent, and oil crop production increased by 129.97 percent. In the first year after liberation, the downward trend of agriculture during the Kuomintang rule was fundamentally reversed, and it began to rise. In 1952, the sown area increased by 22 percent compared with 1949. Among them, the sown area of grain crops increased by 17 percent, the yield increased by more than 50 percent; the cotton field increased by 126 percent, the yield increased by 204 percent; the area of oil crops increased by 62 percent, and the yield increased by 98 percent. The sown area and yield of various crops have greatly exceeded the highest record in the province's history.
    Under the strong promotion of the People's Government and the influence of the advanced production technology of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, farmers have gradually changed their old production habits, began to pay attention to intensive cultivation and selection, fertilization and weeding, and organized labor mutual assistance to improve production efficiency, thereby greatly improving the yield per unit area. In 1952, compared with 1949, the yield per unit area of grain increased by 28 percent, cotton increased by 34 percent, and oil increased by 22 percent. This year, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang achieved a high yield of wheat of more than 1,370 kilograms per mu, breaking the national record.
    While developing agricultural production, a large amount of water conservancy was renovated. Over the past three years, the channels and dams renovated and built by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the large and small channels, karez channels, and spring eyes renovated and built by farmers can increase the irrigation of more than 3.39 million mu of land. A total of more than 14,000 large and small channels, 939 karez channels, and 1,737 spring eyes have been renovated, 160 new channels have been built, 29 new karez channels have been opened, and 1,654 new spring eyes have been dug. Due to the large-scale renovation and construction of water conservancy, the increase in Xinjiang's farmland and the increase in yield have been guaranteed.
    Over the past three years, the People's Government has vigorously purchased local products, enlivened trade in pastoral areas, rationally adjusted the pastoral tax system, promoted improved breeds of livestock, and carried out epidemic prevention injections and treatments, which has also turned animal husbandry from decline to development. In 1952, there were more than 15 million heads of various livestock in the province, and it is expected to develop to 16 million heads by the end of the year, an increase of more than 2 million heads compared with more than 13.2 million heads before the liberation in 1949.
    In 1950 and 1951, more than 30,200 heads of improved and promoted breeds were improved and promoted, and in 1952, 15,000 heads of Lanha sheep were promoted, and efforts are now being made to complete the production task of 100,000 heads of the first generation of improved breeding sheep. Over the past three years, a total of 2,605,000 heads of various livestock have been treated and preventively inoculated in the province (excluding equine glanders and tuberculosis examinations), and 707,600 heads have been treated and preventively inoculated in the first half of 1952 alone.
    2. Prospered trade and enlivened the market. In order to prosper trade,
    After the establishment of the Provincial People's Government in 1949, it opened the exchange between Xinjiang and Xi'an and Lanzhou, increased the exchange rate between the provincial currency and the RMB, and strived for a large number of materials to flow into Xinjiang, thereby enlivening the market and changing the phenomenon of lack of various materials and stagnant transactions in the early days of liberation, so that the people obtained a certain amount of daily necessities. After the unified exercise of the RMB on October 1, 1951, unlimited exchange was carried out, and the support of the national economic strength for Xinjiang was obtained, and more materials from all over the country were transported to Xinjiang; coupled with the development of agricultural and pastoral production in the province and the restoration of Sino-Soviet trade, the market became increasingly prosperous, prices tended to stabilize, and people's lives became stable and initially improved. In particular, after the People's Government planned to lower the prices of general daily necessities, increased the purchase prices of local products, and facilitated the exchange of materials, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products was reduced, and the income of farmers and herdsmen increased significantly. For example, in December 1949, it took 1,794 kilograms of wheat to exchange for a bolt of Yanta cloth; in the first half of this year, it only took 236 kilograms to exchange for a bolt. The price of wheat has relatively increased by 6.6 times. For another example, in 1949, it took 340 kilograms of wool to exchange for a bolt of Yanta cloth, in April 1950, it only took 130 kilograms of wool, and this year it only takes 54 kilograms of wool. The price of wool has relatively increased by 5.3 times. In order to facilitate the exchange of local products for necessities by the people of all ethnic groups, cooperatives have been generally established in various places. At present, there are 216 mass cooperatives, and county-level cooperatives have been established in 80 percent of the counties in Xinjiang.
    3. Opened up tax sources, tightened expenditures, and greatly reduced the fiscal deficit. Before the liberation in 1949, Xinjiang's fiscal deficit reached more than 99 percent; after liberation, the People's Government actively rectified the tax system, abolished the unreasonable old tax system, and implemented a new tax system that simplified procedures and reasonably burdened, and income continued to increase. However, the increase in tax revenue is only a manifestation of the increasingly prosperous economy, and the actual burden on the people is not heavier than in the past, and the agricultural tax burden is much lighter than before liberation. Farmers' surplus grain is increasing day by day. For example, in
    In 1950, the average surplus grain per person in the province was 479 kilograms, in 1951 it was 576 kilograms, and in 1952 it is expected to reach 600 kilograms. In terms of expenditure, due to tightening expenditures, initially establishing and implementing the financial system, organizing the supply of materials, and reducing cash expenditures, the fiscal deficit has been greatly reduced.
    4. Rectified and developed industrial production. In the past, Xinjiang's industry was very small; under the control of bureaucratic capital, it was already dilapidated. After liberation, after rectification, restoration, and democratic reform, a new atmosphere has emerged, and production has greatly increased. For example, the power generation of the Urumqi Power Plant increased by 162 percent in 1951 compared with 1949; the output of coal mines increased by 88.57 percent; and the output of sulfuric acid plants increased by 162 percent. The output of the cement plant increased by 16 times. These factories have gradually embarked on the road of self-sufficiency and enterprise. In addition to the original industries, some modern factories have been newly built. These factories and mines were created to solve the people's means of livelihood and means of production. Xinjiang has now begun to manufacture new agricultural machinery, and is preparing to manufacture a large number of hoes, walking plows and other agricultural tools to supply the needs of farmers, which will play a significant role in promoting the development of agricultural production in the province.
    5. Developed transportation. Xinjiang's original highways were in disrepair for many years, the road surface was bumpy, and many bridges and culverts collapsed. After three years of renovation, the highways open to traffic have reached 7,131 kilometers. In addition, 796 kilometers of new highways have been built. The province now has a total of 7,927 kilometers of highways. In addition, the state-owned transportation company and the postal transportation company have been transformed and rectified, a Sino-Soviet postal route has been established, and postal communication with all parts of the country has been completely restored, airmail routes and automobile postal routes have been opened, and postal and telecommunications lines have been increased. In April 1951, Uyghur telegraph was also created, which greatly facilitated the telecommunications contact between the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
    The above are the main achievements of Xinjiang in finance and economy in the past three years. Thanks to these achievements, the face of Xinjiang's finance and economy has been fundamentally changed, and the people's living standards have been improved, which has laid a solid foundation for Xinjiang's construction in the future.
    These great achievements that Xinjiang has achieved in a short period of three years can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. These achievements are the result of the Communist Party and the Central People's Government caring for ethnic minorities and creating a happy life for the people of all ethnic groups. This is the victory of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy in Xinjiang. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are always sincerely grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and grateful to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    新疆省三年来财政经济建设的成就
    新疆省人民政府副主席  赛福鼎
    新疆解放三年多了。三年来，新疆财政经济建设上的成就是伟大的，极其显著的。凡是过去在新疆居住的人，都可以回想起新疆在解放前夕那一幅残破凄凉的景象。除在一九四四年经过对国民党匪帮的斗争而取得解放的伊犁、塔城、阿山三区外，各族人民的农牧业生产被摧残得支离破碎，对外贸易断绝，对内交通瘫痪，商业萧条，日用必需品奇缺，市场充满形同废纸的伪币，物价一日数涨，人民贫苦不堪，嗷嗷待哺。新疆的财政经济状况陷于完全破产的境地。解放后三年以来，由于新疆省人民政府正确执行了中央人民政府的民族政策和财政经济政策，采取了适合新疆具体情况的方针，又由于全国人民对新疆各兄弟民族的大力支援，很快便扭转了新疆财政经济上的混乱和破产状态，创造了适合于恢复和发展生产的新局面。现在，农牧业生产已经获得了发展，物价基本上趋于稳定，市场日益繁荣活跃，交通运输有了发展，并已开始进行工业建设，使没有现代化工业的新疆开始出现了规模宏大的新式工厂。因此保证了各族人民生活资料和生产资料的供应，人民生活已得到初步改善。
    新疆财政经济建设能够在短短的三年内获得伟大的、显著的成就，是和驻新疆的人民解放军在军事和生产战线上的胜利分不开的。驻新疆的中国人民解放军，三年来英勇地剿灭了土匪，安定了社会秩序，取得了军事战线上的胜利；复以忘我的劳动，带头生产，发挥了高度的创造性和积极性，取得了生产战线上的胜利。没有这些，新疆的财政经济工作就不会有现在这样的成就。驻新疆的人民解放军对新疆人民的贡献是巨大的，因而获得了全新疆各族人民的衷心拥护和爱戴。
    总括起来，新疆三年来在财政经济上的成就，可分以下几点：
    一、发展了农牧业生产。解放后，人民政府对农村进行了初步改革，调剂了土地，实行了合理负担，开展了互助互借，继又完成了减租反恶霸，并开始在农业地区进行着土地改革，农业生产遂获得更大的发展。据统计：一九五○年比一九四九年扩大粮食播种面积百分之九点九八，增产粮食百分之一九点五六；棉田扩大百分之七点一九，增产皮棉百分之六点三九；油料作物面积扩大百分之一百零九点九五，油料作物增产百分之一百二十九点九七。在解放后的第一年内便根本扭转了国民党统治时期农业下降的趋势，开始上升。一九五二年比一九四九年的播种面积增加了百分之二十二。其中粮食作物播种面积增加了百分之一七，产量增加了百分之五十以上；棉田增加了百分之一百二十六，产量增加百分之二百零四；油料作物面积增加了百分之六十二，产量增加百分之九十八。各类农作物的播种面积和产量都大大超过了本省历史上最高纪录。
    在人民政府的大力提倡和驻新疆人民解放军进步的生产技术影响下，农民逐渐改变着旧的生产习惯，开始注意精耕细作及选种、施肥和锄草，并组织了劳动互助，提高了生产效率，因而大大提高了单位面积产量。一九五二年的单位面积产量与一九四九年比较，粮食提高百分之二十八，棉花提高百分之三十四，油料提高百分之二十二。今年，驻新疆的人民解放军某部小麦丰产达到每亩一千三百七十多斤，打破全国最高纪录。
    与发展农业生产同时，大量整修了水利。三年来，驻新疆人民解放军整修和兴修的渠道、水坝和农民整修和兴修的大小渠道，坎儿井道、泉眼等，可增灌三百三十九万多亩土地。共计整修大小渠道一万四千余条、坎儿井九百三十九道、泉眼一千七百三十七个，新建渠道一百六十条，新开坎儿井二十九道，新挖泉眼一千六百五十四个。由于大量整修并兴修了水利，新疆农田的增加及产量的提高有了保证。
    三年来，人民政府大力收购土产，活跃牧区贸易，合理调整牧税制度，推广了改良畜种，进行了防疫注射和治疗，这就使牧畜业也由衰落转向发展。一九五二年全省共有各种牲畜一千五百余万头，到年底可发展至一千六百万头，较一九四九年解放前的一千三百二十多万头，增加二百多万头。
    一九五○和一九五一两年，改良和推广了良种三万零二百余头，一九五二年又推广了兰哈羊种一万五千只，现正为完成第一代改良种羊十万头的生产任务而努力。三年来，全省共治疗及预防注射各种牲畜二百六十万五千多头（马鼻疽及结核检查未包括在内），仅一九五二年上半年就治疗及预防注射七十万七千六百多头。
    二、繁荣了贸易，活跃了市场。为了繁荣贸易，
    一九四九年省人民政府成立以后，便开放了新疆和西安、兰州的汇兑，提高省币与人民币的比价，争取了大批物资流入新疆，从而活跃了市场，改变了解放初期各项物资缺乏，交易停滞的现象，使人民获得一定数量生活必需品。一九五一年十月一日统一行使人民币以后，更开展了无限制的汇兑，取得了全国经济力量对新疆的支持，各地物资更大量地运来新疆；加之本省农牧业的发展和中苏贸易的恢复，市场遂日益繁荣，物价趋于稳定，人民生活随之安定，且有了初步改善。特别是在人民政府有计划地降低一般日用品价格，提高土产收购价格，以及物资交流畅通后，缩小了工农业产品的剪刀差，农牧民的收入有了显著增加。如在一九四九年十二月，用一千七百九十四斤小麦才能换雁塔布一匹；今年上半年用二百三十六斤即可换得一匹。小麦价格相对的提高了六点六倍。又如在一九四九年换一匹雁塔布需三百四十斤羊毛，一九五○年四月仅需一百三十斤羊毛，今年则只要五十四斤羊毛了。羊毛价格相对的提高了五点三倍。为了便于各族人民以土产换取必需品，各地普遍设立了合作社，目前已有群众合作社二百一十六个，全新疆百分之八十的县都建立了县级合作社。
    三、开辟税源，紧缩开支，大大减少了财政赤字。一九四九年解放前，新疆财政赤字达到百分之九十九以上；解放后人民政府积极整顿税制，废除了不合理的旧税制，实行简化手续合理负担的新税制，收入不断增加。但税收的增加只是经济日趋繁荣的表现，人民的实际负担并不比过去重，农业税负担则比解放前减轻很多。农民余粮日益增多。如
    一九五○年全省平均每人的余粮是四七九斤，一九五一年是五七六斤，一九五二年预计可达六百斤。在支出方面，由于紧缩开支，初步建立和执行了财政制度，组织物资供应，减少现金支出，财政赤字大大减少。
    四、整顿并发展了工业生产。过去新疆的工业是很微小的；在官僚资本的控制下，并已残破不堪。解放后经过整顿、恢复，并进行了民主改革后，已出现新的气象，生产大大增加了。如迪化电厂发电量，一九五一年较一九四九年增加了百分之一百六十二；煤矿厂的产量增加了百分之八十八点五七；硫酸厂的产量增加了百分之一百六十二。代水泥厂的产量增加了十六倍。这些工厂已逐渐走上自给自足的企业化道路。除原有工业外，并增建了一些现代化工厂。这些厂矿都是为了解决人民生活资料和生产资料而创建的。现在新疆已开始制造新式农业器械，并准备大量制造坎土曼、步犁等农具，供给农民需要，这对促进本省农业生产的发展将起重大作用。
    五、发展了交通运输。新疆原有的公路因年久失修，路面坎坷不平，很多桥梁、涵洞塌陷。三年来经过整修，通车的公路已有七千一百三十一公里。另外又新建长七百九十六公里的公路。全省现在公路共长七千九百二十七公里。另外还改造和整顿了国营运输公司、驿运公司，建立了中苏邮线，并完全恢复了与全国各地的通邮，开辟了航空邮线和汽车邮路，增加了邮政电信线路。一九五一年四月又创办了维吾尔文电报，大大便利了新疆各民族人民的电信联系。
    以上是新疆三年来在财政经济方面的主要成就。由于获得了这些成就，新疆财政经济的面貌已根本改观了，人民的生活水平提高了，这就为今后新疆建设事业打下了坚固的基础。
    新疆在短短的三年过程中所获得的这些伟大成就，是只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下才能获得的。这些成就是共产党和中央人民政府关心少数民族，并为各少数民族人民创建幸福生活所获致的结果。这是毛主席民族政策在新疆的胜利。新疆各民族人民时刻在诚恳地感谢共产党和毛主席，感谢中国人民解放军。
