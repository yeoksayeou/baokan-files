Report on Adjusting Commercial Issues in the Northwest Region
Ma Mingfang, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee

Editor's Note: The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee held its sixth meeting on December 7th and 8th. This meeting discussed the issue of adjusting commerce in the Northwest Region. Ma Mingfang, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee, made a report on the adjustment of commerce at the meeting. The following is a summary of this report.

After the "Five-Anti" movement, a new change took place in the market business conditions of the Northwest Region. Legitimate industry and commerce have gained new consolidation and a broad position, and have gained the prospect of development; while illegitimate business has been restricted and even eliminated. This change is very beneficial to the development of our industry and commerce. In the "Five-Anti" movement and after the "Five-Anti" movement, the People's Government has taken a series of measures to support the restoration and development of industry and commerce. At present, the public and private industrial production in the Northwest Region has fully recovered and exceeded the previous highest production level. In terms of commerce, the total turnover in various parts of the region has also increased accordingly. The turnover in the third quarter of this year increased by 26.26 percent compared with the same period last year, among which state-owned commerce and cooperatives increased more and faster; the turnover of private commerce in small and medium-sized cities mostly exceeded the level of last year; in large cities such as Xi'an and Lanzhou, except for some industries that should be eliminated naturally shrinking, some exceeded the level of the same period last year, some approached the level of last year, and only some were still some distance from the level of the same period last year. It should be affirmed that our work in commerce has achieved remarkable results. Our commerce will inevitably have a new prosperity with the development of our industrial and agricultural production.

However, we must see that there are still many shortcomings in the commercial operation of some large cities in the Northwest and the commercial operation of general primary markets, in the relationship between public and private sectors, and in the business operations of state-owned stores and cooperatives, which need to be paid attention to and seriously corrected.

I. In some large cities, some private businesses that should be restored and developed have not been fully restored and developed; there are still some uncoordinated phenomena between public and private businesses; the proportion of state-owned businesses in several large cities has generally increased slightly faster, and the proportion of private businesses restored and developed has been slightly slower and smaller. The strengthening and development of the state-owned economy is appropriate and necessary, but the strengthening and development of the state-owned economy must be coordinated with the private economy, so that all private businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood can unite around the state-owned economy and give full play to their existing capital and human resources, which is also appropriate and necessary. But in the past, we did not pay enough attention to this issue in some aspects. In some cities, the retail business and variety of goods operated by state-owned stores and cooperatives were slightly more, relatively reducing the market for private business activities to a certain extent; the starting point for wholesale of some goods was slightly lower, which was equivalent to turning wholesale into retail, which had a certain impact on the retail business of private vendors. In terms of mastering the price of goods, the wholesale and retail price difference of some industrial products was too small, making the profit of private merchants too low and affecting their enthusiasm for operation. In terms of regional price differences, it was also generally too tight, affecting the exchange and turnover of commodities. The prices of some local products also have the phenomenon of being too high or too low, lacking comprehensive consideration of the interests of producers, transporters and consumers, which is not conducive to smooth material exchange, development of production, economic prosperity, and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Since October, although we have made some adjustments in commodity prices, it is still far from enough, and the problem has not been completely solved.

II. In the primary market, private businesses generally have considerable development. Except for some appropriate adjustments in the tasks of purchasing and supplying assigned by the state, the proportion and scope of public and private businesses are generally relatively normal. However, there are still several serious shortcomings in the business policy and business operation, as well as in the price issue. That is, state-owned stores and cooperatives have not operated their businesses well around the issue of organizing farmers to develop production, and have not done enough to contact, support and guide small handicraft production; they have not paid enough attention to promoting the sales of agricultural and sideline products, and supplying farmers with the most lacking important necessities of life, but have operated some non-major necessities of farmers' lives, and even some luxury goods. Some cadres have a blindly restrictive and exclusive ideological sentiment towards the direct transactions between farmers and small handicraftsmen in the market, as well as towards small vendors and other legitimate businesses, which must be corrected.

III. Due to some shortcomings in our leadership work, we have also increased the difficulties in the work of governments at all levels, and caused some adverse consequences in the work. For example, in order to reasonably adjust the supply of cattle and sheep skins and wool, stabilize market prices, and ensure military and civilian use, it is completely necessary and appropriate to properly manage cattle and sheep skins and wool, and plan production. However, when formulating management methods, we stipulated too tightly and strictly, and did not pay enough attention to allowing private merchants to operate reasonably, as well as supplying the needs of some small handicraftsmen and the people, so that some small handicraftsmen once suspended business due to the difficulty in wool supply, and some areas once had the phenomenon that cattle hides were not up to standard and state-owned stores did not purchase them, so there was nowhere to sell them. We have made some revisions to these issues, but we still need to thoroughly check them and make new specific regulations.

In response to the above situation, we must seriously carry out an adjustment of commerce in the near future, and according to the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, we must achieve division of labor and cooperation under the correct leadership of the state-owned economy, and each gets what it deserves. To this end, we must:

I. Reasonably adjust prices and implement the policy of taking into account production, transportation and consumption. State-owned trade organs should appropriately expand the wholesale and retail price differences and regional price differences of goods, and appropriately increase the wholesale starting point. The purchase and sales price difference of agricultural and sideline products should also be reasonably adjusted. The specific adjustment methods should be proposed by the industrial and commercial administrative departments at all levels based on the local situation, and implemented after being approved by the provincial people's governments and the military and administrative committees respectively.

II. Appropriately adjust and divide the scope of public and private commercial operations. State-owned trading companies should implement the policy of focusing on wholesale, and retail commodities should be based on stabilizing prices. Except for some important materials related to the national economy and the people's livelihood that are purchased and sold by the state, private merchants should be encouraged to operate other commodities; for some items, state-owned trading companies should operate less, or even not operate, and those that have been operating commodities that should not be operated and operating too many items should be appropriately adjusted immediately. Fast-selling local products should be allowed for private merchants to operate a part. However, some important local products, as well as local products that private merchants are unable to operate and slow-selling local products, should continue to be operated, so as to open up sales channels and drive private merchants to participate in the operation. In the future, state-owned trade institutions and cooperatives should earnestly strengthen business management, implement economic accounting, and lead the market and serve workers and peasants through business operations. In areas where supply and marketing cooperatives have developed, the current task is to consolidate and improve the established cooperatives; in areas where land reform has just been completed, they should be steadily and appropriately developed. In areas where the business of cooperatives has been developed, the mobile teams of state-owned trading companies should be appropriately reduced, but state-owned stores and trade teams in pastoral areas and mountainous areas should continue to operate, and seek appropriate development in accordance with the actual local conditions.

III. All localities must especially strengthen the leadership of the primary market, and the local state-owned trading companies and cooperatives must adhere to the policy of facing the countryside and serving production, and must operate and organize and drive private businesses to operate agricultural and sideline products and industrial and handicraft products, and supply farmers with means of production and necessities of life. Only in this way can the leading force of the state-owned economy and the binding role of the cooperative economy be fully exerted. If state-owned trade and cooperatives do not pay attention to the operation of farmers' means of production and important necessities of life, as well as the sales of agricultural and sideline products, etc., it is very difficult to activate the primary market.

IV. Strictly ban all inappropriate restrictions on private merchants. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives shall not exercise the administrative powers of industry and commerce, shall not restrict the freedom of private merchants to purchase, transport, and sell goods, and shall not allow restricting farmers and small handicraftsmen from directly trading in the market. Private business operators must also abide by government laws and regulations, actively participate in material exchanges, strictly prohibit speculation and profiteering, and must not repeat the "five poisons."

V. Strictly implement the tax policy. Business tax and income tax shall be levied on the basis of actual turnover and income, and the phenomenon of abnormally light and heavy shall be corrected. For industrial and commercial households that have implemented democratic appraisal, if the assessed tax amount does not conform to the actual situation, it should be reviewed and reconsidered, verified and appraised well, and appropriately adjusted. Clearly stipulate the exemption point to take care of the operation of small vendors. However, it is necessary to strictly prohibit tax evasion, and violators shall be punished according to law to facilitate the development of public and private commerce.

VI. Adjust the relationship between business owners and shop assistants. Shop assistants should take the initiative to unite with the capital side to do a good job in business, abide by labor discipline, and respect the due rights of the capital side; the capital side must abide by labor laws and regulations, respect the political rights and reasonable welfare of shop assistants and employees, and actively operate business.

The people's governments at all levels, especially the industrial and commercial administrative departments, should conduct an inspection based on the above principles, summarize experience, correct shortcomings, improve work; strengthen the leadership of private industry and commerce, help and guide them to improve management and develop business; for those businesses that cannot exist, they should also guide them to gradually change their careers, and must not ignore them.

    关于西北区调整商业问题的报告
    西北军政委员会副主席  马明方
    编者按：西北军政委员会在十二月七、八两日召开第六次会议。这次会议讨论了在西北区调整商业问题。西北军政委员会马明方副主席在会上作了关于调整商业的报告。下面是这个报告的摘要。
    经过“五反”运动，西北区市场营业状况起了一个新的变化。正当的工商业获得了新的巩固和宽阔的阵地，获得了发展的前途；而不正当的营业则受到了限制，甚至被淘汰了。这种变化对于我们工商业的发展是很有益处的。人民政府在“五反”运动中和“五反”运动后，曾经采取了一系列的措施，扶助工商业的恢复与发展。目前西北地区的公私工业生产，已完全恢复并超过以往的最高生产水平。商业方面，全区各地的营业总额亦有相应的增加。今年第三季度营业额较去年同期增加了百分之二六点二六，其中国营商业和合作社增加得较多较快；私营商业的营业额，在中小城镇，大多超过了去年的水平；在西安、兰州等大城市中，除了若干应被淘汰的行业自然缩小外，其余一部分超过去年同期水平，一部分接近去年水平，只有一部分与去年同期水平尚有某些距离。应该肯定，我们在商业方面的工作，是有显著成绩的。我们的商业必然随着我们的工、农业生产的发展而有一个新的繁荣。
    但是我们必须看到，目前在西北某些较大城市的商业和一般初级市场的商业经营中，在公私关系上，以及国营商店与合作社的经营业务上，还有不少缺点，需要引起注意并认真加以改正。
    一、在某些较大城市里，还有一部分应当恢复和发展的私营商业，未能完全得到恢复和发展；公私商业之间，还存在着某些不很协调的现象；国营商业在几个大城市中增加的比重一般地稍大稍快了些，私营商业恢复和发展的比重稍慢稍小了些。国营经济的壮大和发展，这是应当的、需要的，但是国营经济的壮大和发展必须和私营经济取得配合，使一切有利于国计民生的私营商业都能团结在国营经济周围，充分地发挥其现有的资金和人力的作用，这也是应当的、需要的。但我们过去在某些方面对这个问题注意得不很够。在某些城市，国营商店和合作社经营的零销业务、货物品种，稍多了一些，相对地使私营商业活动的市场有某种程度上的缩小；有些货物的批发起点偏低了一些，等于把批发变成了零售，使私商小贩的零售业务受到了一定的影响。在货物价格的掌握上，有些工业品的批发零售差价过小，使私营商贩的利润过低，影响他们的经营积极性。在地区差价方面，一般地也失之过紧，影响了商品的交流周转。某些土产品的价格，也有偏高或偏低的现象，缺乏对于生产者、贩运者和消费者三方面利益的全面照顾，这对于畅通物资交流、发展生产、繁荣经济、巩固工农联盟，是不利的。自十月份起，我们虽已在商品价格方面作了某些调整，但还做得很不够，问题还没有完全解决。
    二、初级市场中，私营商业一般地都有相当的发展。国营商业和合作社除在担负国家所付予的收购和供应任务方面，应作某些适当的调整外，其余公、私营商业的比重和范围一般地还比较正常。但在业务方针和业务经营上，以及价格问题上，还是存在着若干严重的缺点的。这就是国营商店和合作社，没有很好地围绕在组织农民发展生产这个问题上去经营自己的业务，对于小手工业生产的联系、扶持和指导也做得很不够；没有很好地注意到推销农副业产品，和供给农民生活中最缺乏的重要必需品，而经营了一些并非农民生活中的主要必需品，甚至是一些奢侈品。某些干部对于农民和小手工业者在市场上直接进行的交易，以及对于小商贩和其他正当商业，存在着盲目地限制和排挤的思想情绪，这是必须予以纠正的。
    三、由于我们领导工作中的某些缺点，也增加了各级政府进行工作时的困难，并在工作中造成若干不良的后果。例如我们为了合理地调整牛羊皮和羊毛的供应，稳定市场价格，保证军需民用，有计划地进行生产，对于牛羊皮和羊毛加以适当地管理，是完全必要和应当的。但我们在制订管理办法时，规定得太紧太严，对于容许私营商贩合理经营，以及供应部分小手工业者和人民的需要方面，注意得不够，以致部分小手工业者曾经因羊毛供应困难而
    一时停业，有些地区曾经发生因牛皮不合规格，国营商店不收购，即无处出售的现象。这些问题，我们已经作了一些修正，但尚须彻底检查，作出新的具体规定。
    针对上述情况，我们必须于最近期间，认真地进行一次调整商业的工作，根据公私兼顾的政策，要做到在国营经济的正确领导下，分工合作，各得其所。为此我们必须：
    一、合理地调整价格，贯彻产、运、消兼顾的政策。国营贸易机关应适当地扩大货物的批发零售差价和地区差价，并适当提高批发起点。对于农副业产品的购销差价，亦应作合理调整。具体调整办法，应由各级工商行政部门，依据当地情况提出调整计划，经省人民政府和军政委员会分别批准后施行。
    二、适当地调整和划分公私商业经营范围。国营贸易公司应贯彻批发为主的方针，零售商品以稳定物价为准。除关系国计民生的某些重要物资由国家统购统销外，其余商品，应注意鼓励私商经营；有些物品，国营贸易公司应少经营，甚至不经营，已经营了不应当经营的商品和经营过多的物品，应即适当加以调整。畅销土产，应让私商经营一部分。但对某些重要土产以及私商无力经营的土产和滞销土产，仍应继续经营，借以打开销路，带动私商参加经营。今后国营贸易机构与合作社应认真加强经营管理，贯彻经济核算，通过业务经营去领导市场，服务工农。供销合作社已经发展的地区，当前任务是巩固和提高已成立的合作社；在土地改革刚完成地区，应稳步地适当地加以发展。在合作社业务已经发展了的地区，国营贸易公司的流动小组应适当地缩减，但游牧区和山区的国营商店和贸易小组，仍应继续经营，并按照当地实际情况，求得适当的发展。
    三、各地必须特别加强对初级市场的领导，当地国营贸易公司和合作社必须坚持面向农村、服务生产的方针，必须经营并组织和带动私营商业经营农副业产品和工业与手工业产品，供给农民以生产资料和生活必需品。只有这样，才能充分发挥国营经济的领导力量，和合作社经济的纽带作用。国营贸易和合作社如果不注意经营农民生产资料和重要生活必需品的供应，以及农副业产品的推销等业务，初级市场的活跃是很困难的。
    四、严格取缔对私商各种不适当的限制。国营贸易公司与合作社不得代行工商行政管理职权，不得限制私商收购、贩运、销售货物的自由，更不许限制农民和小手工业者在市场上直接进行交易。私营商业者也必须遵守政府法令，积极参加物资交流，严禁投机倒把，不得重犯“五毒”。
    五、严格执行税收政策。按照实际营业额与所得额，依率计征营业税与所得税，纠正畸轻畸重现象。凡实行民主评议的工商户，核定的税额有不符实际情况者，应复查、复议，查实评好，适当调整。明确规定免征点，以照顾小商贩的经营。但务须严禁偷漏税款，违者要依法惩处，以利公私商业的发展。
    六、调整商业主与店员关系。店员应主动团结资方搞好营业，遵守劳动纪律，尊重资方应有的权利；资方必须遵守劳动法令，尊重店员职工政治权利和合理的福利，并积极经营业务。
    各级人民政府，特别是工商行政部门，应根据上述原则进行一次检查，总结经验，纠正缺点，改进工作；加强对私营工商业的领导，帮助指导他们改善经营，发展业务；对于那些无法存在的商业，也要指导其逐渐转业，不许漠视不理。
