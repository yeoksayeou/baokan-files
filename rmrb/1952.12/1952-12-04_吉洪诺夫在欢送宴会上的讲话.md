　　The Soviet cultural workers delegation participated in the activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" and is now about to return home. The delegation has entrusted me to express our heartfelt and deep gratitude to the Chinese government and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association for their warm and friendly hospitality.
　　The members of the delegation have visited many cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Nanjing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Changsha, Lanzhou, and Xi'an. These days have been unforgettable days of association. Thanks to the perfect planning of our Chinese comrades, we have been able to gain a broad understanding of the life of the new free China. We have seen Chinese cities and villages, and we have visited enterprises, factories, universities and middle schools, theaters, and museums. We were greatly delighted when we saw the general upsurge in China's economic and cultural life. We saw the land and people of free China. Everywhere we saw new phenomena: after the land reform, the land finally found its true owners, we met agricultural models, and in factories we met production models, and saw the railways that the Chinese people had built in the shortest possible time with great enthusiasm.
　　We have held discussions with workers, peasants, scholars, writers, and actors, and we have met with university and middle school students in many venues. We have seen excellent Chinese children, whose happy future is guaranteed by the Chinese people's historical victory.
　　We have seen ancient Chinese historical relics – the great art created by Chinese people's artists. We have also seen the great new achievements of the Chinese people, which show that advanced technology is combined with the spirit of love for labor of the builders of the new country.
　　Wherever we went, we encountered the heartfelt and warm feelings of the Chinese people expressing their friendship towards the Soviet people. We are very happy to see that this friendship is living in everyone's heart and is developing more widely, turning into many great undertakings, in which the Soviet experience is widely used. When we return to our homeland, we must tell the Soviet people, who are closely watching the new life of China, everything we have seen with our own eyes.
　　The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China is a fortress of world peace, and this friendship is growing and consolidating day by day. And no force can hinder the development of this unbreakable friendship.
　　Long live the permanent friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the great Chinese people!
　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
　　Long live the faithful and best friend of the Chinese people, the peace standard-bearer, the great Stalin!

　　吉洪诺夫在欢送宴会上的讲话
    苏联文化工作者代表团参加了“中苏友好月”的活动，现在即将返国，——代表团委托我向中国政府和中苏友好协会总会对我们的热烈的，友谊的款待，致以衷心的，深厚的谢意。
    代表团的团员们到过了许多城市：北京、上海、广州、汉口、武昌、南京、重庆、杭州、成都、长沙、兰州、西安等地。这些天都是一些难忘的相处的日子。由于中国同志们的完善的计划，我们能够广泛地了解了新的自由中国的生活。我们看见了中国的城市和乡村，我们参观了企业、工厂、大学和中学、剧院、博物馆。当我们看到中国的经济和文化生活的普遍高涨时，我们感到很大的喜悦。我们看到了自由中国的土地和人民。到处我们都看到新的现象：土地改革以后，土地终于找到了自己的真正的主人，我们会见了农业模范，在工厂中会见了生产模范，看到了中国人民以高度的热诚，在最短时间内，修建起来的铁路。
    我们曾经和工人、农民、学者、作家、演员们举行座谈，我们曾经在许多的会场上和大学与中学生们见面，我们看见了优秀的中国儿童，中国人民以自己的历史性的胜利，保证了他们的幸福的将来。
    我们看到了中国古代的历史文物——这些都是中国人民艺术家所创造的伟大艺术。我们还看到了中国人民的伟大的新的成就，——这些成就说明着先进的技术是和新国家建设者们的热爱劳动的精神相结合起来。
    无论我们走到什么地方，——我们到处都遇到中国人民向苏联人民所表示的衷心的友谊的热烈情感。我们很高兴地看到，这种友谊正活在每个人的心坎中，并且在更加广泛地发展起来，转而成为许多伟大的事业，在这些事业里广泛地利用着苏联的经验。当我们回到我们的祖国，我们一定要把我们亲眼所看到的一切，告诉给密切注视着中国的新生活的苏联人民。
    苏中两国人民的友谊是世界和平的堡垒，这种友谊正在一天一天地增长和巩固。并且没有任何一种力量能阻挠这种牢不可破的友谊的发展。
    中苏两国人民的永久的友谊万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    中国人民的忠实的，最好的朋友，和平旗手伟大的斯大林万岁！
