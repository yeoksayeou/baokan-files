Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: A Burmese "People's Daily" editorial published in Mandalay exposes the essence of the illegal resolution on the Korean question passed by the United Nations General Assembly based on India's proposal. The newspaper said that India clearly knew that the United States was using negotiations to delay time and prepare to expand the war, but it disregarded international law and put forward an absurd proposal at the United Nations General Assembly. Although the tone of this proposal on the issue of prisoner repatriation is different, it is essentially the same as the United States' "voluntary repatriation." The newspaper said that the Indian proposal can deceive those who do not know the American conspiracy or pretend to be confused, but its rejection by China is justified because this proposal actually helps the American aggressors in their attacks on peaceful people.

    缅甸“人民报”发表社论
    揭露印度提案的实质
    【新华社二十三日讯】曼德勒消息，缅甸曼德勒“人民报”发表社论，揭露联合国大会根据印度提案通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案的实质。该报说，印度明明知道美国是在利用谈判拖延时间，准备扩大战争，可是它竟不顾国际公法，在联合国大会上提出了一个荒唐的提案。这提案对遣俘问题虽然腔调不同，但和美国的“自愿遣返”实在是同出一辙。该报说，印度提案可以欺骗那些不知道美国阴谋或者假装糊涂的人，但是它被中国拒绝是理所当然的事，因为这个提案实际上帮助了美国侵略者向和平人民的进攻。
