    Chang Qing's Writing Teaching Method Inspires Me
    Comrade Editor: After reading the article "Introducing Chang Qing's Writing Teaching Method" published on page 3 of the People's Daily on December 6th, I haven't been able to sleep well for several nights. I've read this article a total of three times, and not a single sentence or word doesn't resonate with me. I'm a roughneck from a worker-peasant background, herding cattle for landlords since I was a child until I was liberated by joining the revolution. I've been in the revolution for seven or eight years, and although I'm now a cadre and have learned more than two thousand characters in the revolutionary ranks, I still can't understand general texts sometimes, let alone write. I can't write plans, summaries, or reports, which makes me very distressed. Once, the higher-ups asked me to summarize a piece of work and write it down, but I struggled for two or three days and still couldn't write it. Even today, whenever the organization gives me a major task, I always feel a lot of difficulties because of my low cultural level. After Comrade Qi Jianhua created the rapid literacy method, I was very happy, but this still couldn't satisfy my requirements. Because I already know several thousand characters now, my difficulty is that I can't bring myself to write. I thought to myself: who can create a rapid writing method again? I think about it every day. Finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the things we workers and peasants hope for are being realized one by one.
    Chang Qing's writing teaching method says that comrades from worker-peasant backgrounds have "ten fears" and "three barriers" in their minds, which completely matches my situation. That's exactly how I am. Our organization runs a spare-time school, but it's been over a year now, and I still haven't signed up; my name isn't on the roll call. Why? Because first, I'm afraid of exams, and second, I'm afraid the teacher will ask me to write compositions. Now, with Chang Qing's writing teaching method, I feel like I have a weapon, I have courage. I will definitely delve into it and, according to the spirit of Chang Qing's writing teaching method, gradually learn to write well, so that I can do more work for the people in the future.
    I thank Comrade Chang Qing for the success of his great creation and wish him good health. I hope the newspaper will introduce more practical examples of worker-peasant cadres who have succeeded in writing, using these examples to encourage us.

### 常青写作教学法鼓舞着我

    常青写作教学法鼓舞着我
    编辑同志：我看了十二月六日人民日报第三版登载的“介绍常青的写作教学法”一文之后，几夜睡不着觉。这篇文章，我前后一共看了三遍，它没有一句话、没有一个字不合我的心意。我是没有上过学的大老粗，从小就给地主放牛，直到参加革命才得到了解放。我参加革命七八年，今天虽然已经是个干部，在革命队伍里也认识了二千多个字，但是一般的文字有时还不能看懂，要是叫我写，那更不行了。不能写计划，不能写总结，不能写报告，使我十分苦恼。有一次，上级叫我总结一件工作，并且叫我写来，我啃了两三天，还是没有写出来。直到今天，每逢组织上给我一个较大的任务，因为文化水平低，我总是感到好多困难。祁建华同志创造了速成识字法以后，我很高兴，可是，这还不能满足我的要求。因为我现在已经认识几千字啦，我的困难是提不起笔来。我一个人想：什么人能再创造速成写作法呢？我每天都在想着。终于，在共产党的领导下，我们工农所希望的事一一实现了。
    常青写作教学法上说，工农出身的同志有“十怕”、“三关”的思想顾虑，这完全合乎我的情况，我就是这样。我们机关里办有业余学校，可是到现在已有一年多，我还是没有报名，点名册上没有我的名字。为什么呢？因为第一，怕考试，第二，怕老师叫做作文。现在，有了常青写作教学法，我觉得就有了武器，有了勇气，我一定好好地钻进去，根据常青写作教学法的精神，逐步学习写作，学好写作，以便将来能为人民做更多的工作。
    我感谢常青同志的伟大创造的成功，祝他身体健康。我希望报社为我们多多介绍工农干部在写作上得到成功的实际例子，用这样的例子来鼓励我们。
