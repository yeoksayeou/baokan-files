The people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region overcame numerous difficulties and exceeded this year's production increase task.

In 1951, the Inner Mongolia region suffered a drought, and the entire agricultural area experienced only about 50% of a normal harvest. At that time, the Autonomous Region People's Government fully mobilized and organized the masses for self-salvation through production. Many farmers who were severely affected by the disaster not only completely solved their livelihood problems, but also were able to add carts and horses and purchase more agricultural tools, laying a good foundation for expanding reproduction. The people in the disaster-stricken and non-disaster-stricken areas promoted the great spirit of class love, and many touching stories emerged in mutual assistance and mutual relief. Free loans and donations of food throughout the region amounted to approximately 15 million jin. The Autonomous Region People's Government also successively distributed 10 million jin of relief grain, 8 billion yuan of relief funds, and 7.5 billion yuan of sideline loans, which played a significant role in boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production and supporting disaster victims in weathering the difficulties.

This year, Inner Mongolia suffered from a relatively widespread insect plague (wireworms, aphids, cutworms, etc.). The people of Inner Mongolia waged a resolute struggle against the pests. According to incomplete statistics, more than 760,000 jin of various pests were captured and killed throughout the region, basically achieving "early detection and on-the-spot elimination," saving most of the affected crops.

The Inner Mongolia region experiences drought in nine out of ten years. Well-digging, canal construction, and other drought prevention work are long-term and important tasks for Inner Mongolia. From mid-March to mid-April this year, in just one month, the entire agricultural area completed more than 9,200 water wells and more than 680 large and small canals, irrigating more than 70,000 hectares of land during the spring plowing and summer hoeing stages. Linxi County irrigated 45,000 hectares of land before June, exceeding the county's total irrigated area last year by one time.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government advocated timely early planting and the cultivation of multiple early-maturing and drought-resistant varieties this year. This year, the crops in the entire Inner Mongolia region were generally planted half a month to 20 days earlier than in previous years, which was unprecedented. Kailu County in the Jirem League began sowing wheat on March 20, and the relatively cold Hulunbuir League and Chahar League also started plowing comprehensively in early April. The effect of timely early planting was very significant: the crops emerged well and grew vigorously. A few crops that were planted late either failed to emerge due to poor soil moisture, or the seedlings were dried out by the wind after emerging. This stark contrast made a deep impression on the masses, making them deeply aware of the benefits of timely early planting. The sown area this year was also larger than in the past: wheat increased by more than 33% compared to last year; millet increased by more than 45% compared to last year.

The agricultural technology in the Inner Mongolia region is relatively backward, and cultivation is extensive, so the potential capacity of the land is great. Therefore, improving cultivation techniques and fostering soil fertility has become a key issue for Inner Mongolia in increasing farmland yields. This year, various regions implemented deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and generally increased the number of hoeing passes. In the Hinggan League, 40% of the land was hoed three times, and in the Ju Ud League, 50% of the cultivated land was hoed more than three times. The total area of fertilization throughout the region reached 600,000 hectares, accounting for 36% of the total cultivated area, exceeding the planned fertilization area by 5% and increasing by 27% compared to last year; topdressing was also tried out relatively widely.

The agricultural and pastoral people of Inner Mongolia are advancing on the road of "organizing." There are nearly 70,000 mutual aid teams of various types throughout the region, of which permanent teams account for approximately 36%. Fifteen agricultural production cooperatives have also been established. More than 590,000 laborers have been organized, accounting for approximately 80% of the total labor force. A bumper harvest competition has formed a widespread mass movement. In the Hinggan League alone, 3,780 mutual aid teams, 224 "Gacha" (administrative units under the banner), 797 natural villages, and 4,049 individual farmers enthusiastically joined the competition movement. The Autonomous Region People's Government successively lent out more than 15 billion yuan in agricultural loans this year, replenishing waterwheels, agricultural tools, seeds, pesticides, etc. for farmers, and promptly solved the problem of the masses' lack of means of production.

After these many efforts, the total grain output of the entire region this year is expected to exceed the planned number by approximately 10%. The average yield per hectare increased by 300 jin compared to normal years. The farmers of Inner Mongolia have gloriously completed and exceeded the great task of increasing the average yield of grain by 150 jin per hectare.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government and the people of Inner Mongolia are continuing to make unremitting efforts to consolidate and develop the achievements they have made. Preparations: (1) Further vigorously promote deep plowing, gradually promote new agricultural tools, especially new walking plows, and require that they be widely promoted and used in a short period of time; (2) Consolidate the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, strive for greater development, overcome the current existing spontaneous outflow phenomenon and the impetuous thinking of aiming too high, and gradually move towards agricultural collectivization; (3) On the basis of the existing drought prevention work, carry out farmland water conservancy work on a larger scale and in a planned manner, continue to dig wells and canals, promote autumn and spring water storage, and rapidly expand the irrigated area of dry land; (4) In order to prevent famine years, prepare to draw on the advanced experience of other regions and focus on piloting voluntary granaries.

    内蒙古自治区超额完成今年增产任务
    每垧地平均产量比常年产量提高了三百斤
    内蒙古自治区人民战胜重重困难，今年超额完成了增产任务。
    一九五一年内蒙地区遭受旱灾，整个农业区平均只有五成年景。当时自治区人民政府全力发动和组织群众生产自救。很多受灾较重的农民，不但完全解决了生活问题，还能添置车马、增购农具，为扩大再生产打下了良好基础。灾区和非灾区人民发扬了伟大的阶级友爱精神，在互助互济中出现了许多动人的事迹。全区的自由借贷和捐助救济的食粮约一千五百万斤。自治区人民政府又先后发放了救济粮一千万斤，救济款八十亿元，副业贷款七十五亿元，在提高群众生产热情支持灾民稳度灾荒上起了很大作用。
    今年，内蒙又遭到了比较普遍的虫灾（金针虫、腻虫、夜盗虫等）。内蒙人民向害虫进行了坚决的斗争。据不完全统计，全区共捕杀各种害虫计七十六万多斤，基本上做到了“早期发现，就地消灭”，挽救了大部分受害的庄稼。
    内蒙地区十年九旱，打井、挖渠等防旱工作是内蒙的一个长期性的重要任务。今年三月中旬到四月中旬，在短短的一个月当中，全农业区共完成水井九千二百多眼，大小渠道六百八十多条，在春耕夏锄阶段浇地七万多垧。林西县在六月份前就浇了四万五千垧地，超过全县去年灌溉面积的一倍。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府今年提倡适时早种和多种早熟耐旱的品种。今年全内蒙地区的庄稼破天荒地普遍地比往年早种了半个月到二十天。哲里木盟开鲁县在三月二十日就开始播种小麦，气候较冷的呼纳盟和察哈尔盟也在四月初全面开犁。适时早种的效果是十分显著的：庄稼出苗好，长得旺。有少数种迟了的，不是墒土不好没捉住苗，就是苗出土后被风吹干了。这一鲜明的对比，在群众中造成深刻的印象，使他们深切地体会到适时早种的好处。今年播种面积也比过去扩大了：小麦比去年增加了百分之三十三强；谷子比去年增加了百分之四十五强。
    内蒙地区的农业技术比较落后，耕作粗放，土地的潜在能力很大。所以，改进耕作技术，培养地力，就成为内蒙地区提高农田产量的一个问题。今年各地都实行了深耕细作，普遍增加了铲趟遍数。兴安盟有百分之四十的土地做到三铲三趟，昭乌达盟百分之五十的耕地铲了三遍以上。全区施肥面积共达六十万垧，占总耕地面积百分之三十六，超过计划施肥面积百分之五，比去年增加了百分之二十七；并且较为普遍地试行了追肥。
    内蒙农牧人民在“组织起来”的道路上前进着。全区各种类型的互助组近七万个，其中常年组约占百分之三十六。还成立了十五个农业生产合作社。组织起来的劳动力已有五十九万多人，约占劳动力总数的百分之八十。丰产竞赛形成了广泛的群众性的运动。仅兴安盟就有三千七百八十个互助组、二百二十四个“嘎查”（旗下面的行政单位）、七百九十七个自然屯、四千零四十九个个体农民，热烈地投入了竞赛运动。自治区人民政府在今年先后三次贷出农业贷款一百五十多亿元，为农民补充了水车、农具、种籽、农药等，及时地解决了群众缺乏生产资料的问题。
    经过这许多努力，今年全区粮食总产量约超过计划数的百分之十。平均每垧产量比常年产量提高三百斤。内蒙农民已光荣地完成并超过了每垧平均增产一百五十斤原粮的伟大任务。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府和内蒙人民正在继续不断的努力，巩固并发展已得的成绩。准备：（一）进一步大力提倡深耕，逐步推行新农具，特别是新式步犁，要求在短期内能大量推广使用；（二）巩固互助合作组织的基础，争取更大的发展，克服目前还存在的自流现象和好高鹜远的急躁思想，逐步地走向农业集体化；（三）在已有的防旱工作的基础上，更大规模地有计划地开展农田水利工作，继续打井挖渠，提倡春秋汇地，迅速扩大旱田灌溉面积；（四）为预防荒年，准备吸取其他地区的先进经验，重点试办义仓。    （尚赞勋）
