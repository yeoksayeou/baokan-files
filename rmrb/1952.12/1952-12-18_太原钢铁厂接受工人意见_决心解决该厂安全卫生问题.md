    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Accepts Workers' Opinions
    Determined to Solve Safety and Health Problems
    Comrade Editor: The letter from a group of workers in our plant and the investigation report by the People's Daily reporter, published on the "Reader's Letters" page on November 10th, profoundly exposed and criticized our plant's neglect of worker safety and health. The Party Committee and the administrative side of our plant immediately convened meetings to specifically discuss and study this issue, and organized cadres, led by the Safety Section, to go to the workshops to inspect safety and health conditions and solicit workers' opinions. This allowed us to further recognize the seriousness of the safety and health problems in our plant and the opinions and demands of the workers regarding this issue. We must strive to solve this problem.
    In the three years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and superiors, and relying on the efforts of all employees, our plant's production has developed rapidly. After the democratic reform and the "Three-Anti" movements, the consciousness of the employees has greatly improved. We then became complacent, believing that we had done a lot of work in safety and health in the past, and that the problems had been solved quite well. After this inspection, we realized that the problems were still quite serious, and some problems had not been fundamentally resolved. Before the start of the autumn competition campaign this year, we had already felt the severity of personal accidents and conducted a major safety inspection. At that time, workers raised 1,030 issues, and although 680 of them were resolved immediately, many major issues were not resolved. Recently, we prepared to convene a workers' representative meeting, and the workers again put forward 860 proposals on safety and health issues. This fully shows that the problems in safety and health in our plant are still very serious.
    Why have we failed to fundamentally solve or improve safety and health problems in the past three years? Of course, the problems left over from the old enterprise are serious, but the main reason is that our reliance on the working class is not comprehensive enough, and the erroneous thinking of emphasizing production and neglecting safety, or even opposing production and safety, is very serious. Over the past few years, the plant has never systematically inspected and comprehensively studied how to improve safety and health work; even when plans were made, they were not comprehensive enough, and even less were they seriously implemented. The safety organization is not sound, and therefore has not played its due role. The main leading cadres are only busy with production and do not care about safety. For example, a workshop director, in order to rush the task, even mobilized workers to work in the kiln at a temperature of over 100 degrees Celsius. When the workers raised their opinions, he said: "The task cannot be completed without doing this." Many cadres have conservative ideas and look at new things with old eyes, believing that many problems have been solved and a lot of money has been spent in the past few years, which has further fueled the idea of "emphasizing wealth and neglecting people." In addition, the design also reflects a purely production-oriented viewpoint: toilets and bathrooms were not included in the plans for new construction projects, and even space was not left for them. This makes the development of safety and health work unable to keep up with the development of production, and far behind the urgent demands of the workers. The Party Committee also estimated that safety and health issues were historical and mass issues, and wanted to solve them in a concentrated and prominent way during a certain period. However, due to the dominance of the above-mentioned ideas, not only did we fail to solve the problems in a concentrated and prominent way, but we also did not pay attention to seizing every link to solve them anytime and anywhere. This made the workers believe that not only did the administrative departments not solve the problems, but they also lost confidence in asking the Party Committee and the trade union to solve the problems, thus alienating the Party Committee from the masses on this issue.
    This situation must be changed. We have decided to take the following measures:
    1. Leaders take the lead, and inspections are carried out from top to bottom to reverse the thinking of emphasizing production and neglecting safety. On December 8th, we will convene a workers' representative meeting focusing on solving safety and health problems, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, seriously solve some urgent problems, and conduct an in-depth safety and health education. Establish, improve, and revise various safety regulations and systems to lay the foundation for future safety and health work.
    2. For major problems such as high temperature, poisoning, dust, and gas, upon the recommendation of the Party Committee, it was decided to basically solve them within one year. The problems raised in this inspection and the workers' representative meeting will also be actively solved according to their importance and urgency. In addition, it should be pointed out that the furnace temperature is too high during the operation of the coke oven platform in our plant, which seriously damages the health of the workers. This problem, which could not be solved for fifteen years, has recently been completely solved under the guidance of Soviet experts. In order to solve the poisoning problem, we have moved the power benzene, tar pipes, and asphalt ponds outside the building on the suggestion of Soviet experts. Dust problems are also temporarily resolved or improved by using enclosure, installing automatic screens, adding dust extraction, spraying equipment, etc. The problems of toilets and changing rooms have also been temporarily solved first.
    3. Establish, improve, or strengthen labor protection and safety and health organizations. The Safety Technology and Labor Protection Section is directly led by the factory director, and it is planned to add full-time safety personnel in each workshop. Include safety and health work in the regular work plan, and regularly deploy, inspect, and summarize.
    4. Formulate new employee onboarding education methods, draw a large number of safety posters, and plan to open safety training classes.
    5. The Party Committee will designate a standing committee member to be specifically responsible for safety and health issues.

### 太原钢铁厂接受工人意见  决心解决该厂安全卫生问题

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    太原钢铁厂接受工人意见
    决心解决该厂安全卫生问题
    编辑同志：十一月十日“读者来信专页”所载我厂一群工人的来信和人民日报记者的调查报告，深刻地揭发和批评了我厂忽视工人安全卫生的情况。我厂党委会和行政方面当即召开会议专门讨论、研究这一问题，并以安全科为主组织干部下车间检查安全卫生情况和征询工人意见。这才使我们进一步认识了我厂安全卫生问题的严重情况及工人群众对这一问题的意见和要求。我们一定要努力解决这个问题。
    解放三年来，我厂在党和上级的领导下，依靠全体职工的努力，生产发展很快。经过民主改革、“三反”等运动，职工觉悟大大提高。我们就产生了自满情绪，认为过去在安全卫生方面做了不少工作，问题已解决得不坏了。经过这次检查，我们才感到问题仍然相当严重，而且有些问题基本上未得到解决。今年秋季竞赛运动开始前，我们已感到人身事故的严重性，曾作了一次安全大检查。当时工人提出了一、○三○件问题，虽立即解决了六八○件，但很多主要问题都没解决。最近我们准备召开职工代表会，职工们又提出八六○件安全卫生问题的提案。这充分说明我厂在安全卫生方面的问题还很严重。
    为什么我们三年来未能根本解决或改善安全卫生问题呢？固然，旧企业留下的问题很严重，但主要原因是我们依靠工人阶级的思想不够全面，重生产、轻安全，甚至把生产和安全对立起来看的错误思想很严重。几年来，全厂从未系统地检查并全面研究改善安全卫生工作；有时虽作了计划，也不够全面，更没有认真贯彻。安全组织不健全，因而未起应有的作用。主要领导干部只忙生产，不问安全。如某车间主任为赶任务，竟动员工人在摄氏一百多度高温下出窑。工人提出意见。他说：“不这样就完不成任务。”不少干部有保守思想，以旧眼光看新事物，认为几年来已解决了不少问题，花了不少钱，愈益助长了“重财轻人”的思想。此外，在设计方面也反映了单纯生产观点：在新建工程中并未将厕所、浴室等列入计划，甚至连地方也没留出。这就使安全卫生工作的发展跟不上生产的发展，并远远落在工人的迫切要求后面。党委也曾估计到安全卫生问题是带有历史性、群众性的问题，想在一个时期集中地、突出地加以解决。但由于上述思想的支配，不仅没有做到集中地、突出地解决问题，而且也没有注意随时随地抓住每个关节来解决。这使工人群众不仅认为行政主管部门不解决问题，而且对要求党委与工会解决问题也没有了信心，因而使党委在这个问题上脱离了群众。
    这种情况必须改变，我们决定采取以下措施：
    一、领导带头，自上而下层层检查，扭转重生产、轻安全的思想。在十二月八日召开一次以解决安全卫生问题为中心内容的职工代表会，虚心听取群众意见，认真解决一些迫切需要解决的问题，并深入进行一次安全卫生教育。建立、健全、修订各种安全规程与制度，为以后安全卫生工作打下基础。
    二、对于高温、中毒、粉尘、煤气等主要问题，经党委建议，决定在明年一年内基本解决。这次检查与职工代表会所提出的问题也都分别轻重缓急，积极设法解决。此外，应当提出的：我厂焦炉炉台作业时炉温过高，严重损害工人健康。这个十五年来不能解决的问题，最近在苏联专家指导下已作了彻底解决。为了解决中毒问题，在苏联专家建议下我们已把动力苯、焦油管、沥青池移到房外。粉尘问题也分别用密闭、安自动筛、添置抽尘、喷雾等设备，予以临时解决或改进。厕所及更衣室的问题也先作了临时解决。
    三、建立、健全或加强劳动保护和安全卫生组织。安全技术劳动保护科直接由厂长领导，并拟于各车间增设安全专职人员。把安全卫生工作列入经常工作计划中，定期布置、检查、总结。
    四、制定新工人入厂教育办法，大量绘制安全挂图，并拟开办安全训练班。
    五、党委会指定一个常委委员专门负责安全卫生问题。
