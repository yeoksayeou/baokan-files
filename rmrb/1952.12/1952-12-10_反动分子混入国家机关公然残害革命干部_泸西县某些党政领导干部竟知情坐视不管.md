To the Editors:

Intense feelings of indignation stir me, compelling me to write to you and report this deeply distressing event. On November 6th, the Yunnan Daily published an article stating that Luo Shilin, the president of the Luxi County Health Center in Yunnan Province—a reactionary element who had infiltrated state organs—brazenly and publicly used heinous and inhuman means to murder the revolutionary female cadre Dou Duanxiao. What is even more infuriating and distressing is that many Party and government leaders in the county, headed by Mu Meisheng, the secretary of the Luxi County Party Committee, already knew about this incident but shamefully sat by and watched the reactionary elements run amok; afterwards, they delayed taking firm action. It was only after repeated urging from the Yunnan Daily and an investigation by the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee that this incident was addressed. Now I will tell you the course of this event.

Luo Shilin, the president of the Luxi County Health Center, was originally a lieutenant colonel medical officer in Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army. After liberation, his reactionary ideology remained unchanged, and he seized a leading position in our people's health organs. He disobeyed the leadership of the county People's Government Health Section; his work was consistently perfunctory, and his treatment of peasants was careless. In the office, he consistently engaged in sabotage, openly insulted the Communist Party, and colluded with some backward elements to attack cadres who sought progress. He was a corrupt element who refused to confess during the "Three-Anti" movement and suppressed democracy. It was during the tumultuous "Three-Anti" movement that he brazenly murdered the revolutionary female cadre Dou Duanxiao.

Dou Duanxiao was a staff member of the Yiliang Special District Health Section, an enthusiastic and actively progressive eighteen-year-old female youth. She was sent to Luxi County to carry out vaccination work, and because she struggled against Luo Shilin's illegal behavior and bad work style, she was repeatedly attacked. During the "Three-Anti" movement, she reported Luo Shilin's corrupt behavior and actively participated in the "tiger hunt," which made Luo Shilin resent her even more. In mid-May, Luo Shilin colluded with some backward staff members in the office and, taking advantage of the opportunity to evaluate her, fabricated fourteen shortcomings and falsely accused her of having improper relationships with men and women. Luo Shilin also used the excuse that she had entered his house and rummaged through things and beat her several times; he also had a "conversation" with her for five and a half hours, wantonly insulting and attacking her. Under this series of provocations, Dou Duanxiao finally became mentally disturbed. Luo Shilin not only did not give her treatment but also maliciously said that Dou Duanxiao had "lustful madness" and instructed Tian Lihua and Zhou Guixiang, two students from the health training class, to beat her with wooden sticks. Then, Luo tied her up and chained her to a large tree next to the toilet, leaving her exposed to the cold, hunger, and rain, and even used a bamboo tube for drenching horses to give her a strong laxative. Two days later, Dou Duanxiao was locked in a room next to the toilet. Under this barbaric torture, Dou Duanxiao was mentally exhausted and extremely weak. At this time, the counter-revolutionary element Luo Shilin further committed a crime devoid of humanity. On the afternoon of May 26th, Luo Shilin instructed a "herbal doctor" to cut off the head of a rooster and insert it into Dou Duanxiao's vagina; then, Dou Duanxiao was wrapped in a quilt and tied up inside and out. Dou Duanxiao could not move at all, was sweating all over, and then fell into a coma. At this time, Luo Shilin gave Dou Duanxiao several injections; at 3:00 a.m. on May 27th, Dou Duanxiao died during Luo Shilin's injection. After her death, the Luxi County People's Court conducted an autopsy and proved that Dou Duanxiao's ten fingers were cyanotic, indicating that she died of poisoning.

Although Dou Duanxiao was mentally disturbed, she always insisted on struggling against the persecution of reactionary elements and was full of confidence in the Party. In the process of being persecuted to death, she constantly shouted: "Luo Shilin is reactionary; Chairman Mao's leadership is correct."

To the Editors: Such an incident not only happened in the people's country but also happened in our state organs; this is really shocking and intolerable. The Luxi County Party and government leading organs should bear serious responsibility for the occurrence of this incident. Luo Shilin's persecution of Dou Duanxiao to death lasted for about half a month. During this period, Li Runeng, a staff member of the health center and a member of the Youth League, repeatedly reported the true situation to the county People's Government and informed the county Party committee, but no action was taken. When Tang Xiaoquan (a Communist Party member), the propaganda officer of the county Party committee, saw that Dou Duanxiao's nerves had begun to be disordered due to Luo Shilin's insults and provocations, he also reported to Mu Meisheng, the secretary of the county Party committee, and suggested that Dou Duanxiao be given care; however, Mu Meisheng did not express any opinion. When Dou Duanxiao was slandered by Luo Shilin as having "lustful madness" and locked under a tree for people to "watch," Mu Meisheng actually went to "watch." Lin Dazhang (a Communist Party member), the director of the Tax Bureau of the county People's Government, who went with him, suggested to Mu Meisheng that Dou Duanxiao should be sent to rest, but Mu Meisheng still did not take action. Lin Dazhang did not dare to insist on the correct opinion either. After Dou Duanxiao was killed, Shao Guanghua, the president of the county People's Court, went to conduct an autopsy, accompanied by Wang Ming (a Communist Party member), the head of the personnel section of the county People's Government, and Shen Yingchun (a Communist Party member), the organization officer of the county Party committee. At that time, they found that Dou Duanxiao had died of poisoning, but they did not investigate the responsibility in depth and only asked Luo Shilin to reflect. Afterwards, Shen Yingchun and Tang Xiaoquan reported this situation to Mu Meisheng, but Mu Meisheng said: "Calm down, handle it slowly." Shen Yingchun and Tang Xiaoquan were very dissatisfied but did not dare to insist any further. Liu Liansan (a Communist Party member), the deputy director of the county Public Security Bureau, took office after the incident and asked Mu Meisheng for instructions to arrest Luo Shilin, but Mu Meisheng still hesitated and did not take action. Although Liu Liansan was dissatisfied, he did not dare to insist. It was not until July 10th, a month and a half after Dou Duanxiao was killed, that the Public Security Bureau finally decided to arrest Luo Shilin; however, Mu Meisheng still did not advocate the arrest. After Luo Shilin was arrested, he was only interrogated once or twice, and the entire case was not dealt with in a timely manner. Mu Meisheng did not report the above situation to the higher-level Party organization. In addition, Yang Chujiang (a Communist Party member), the head of the Health Section of the Yiliang Special District, also learned about the relevant details of the Dou Duanxiao incident, but only inquired about it in advance and covered it up afterwards, without investigating the responsibility in depth or reporting it to the higher authorities.

In June, the editorial department of the Yunnan Daily received a reader's letter and learned about this situation, so it repeatedly wrote letters to the Luxi County People's Government, the Yiliang Prefectural Party Committee of the CCP, and the Luxi County Party Committee of the CCP to investigate and deal with this incident, but it did not attract the attention it deserved from the above-mentioned organs. Although the Luxi County Party Committee of the CCP made a preliminary review of the matter and organized a "Dou Duanxiao Incident" handling committee, it did not carry out any work. Mu Meisheng, the secretary of the county Party committee, made an extremely superficial review at a meeting of county-level organ cadres. Many cadres were very dissatisfied after listening to it, but they did not have the opportunity to express their opinions. In mid-September, after the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee of the CCP learned about this situation from the newspaper, it immediately called the Yiliang Prefectural Party Committee to investigate the matter and ordered the Yiliang Prefectural Party Committee to make a serious response. At this time, the Yiliang Prefectural Party Committee sent Chen Guangkui, a member of the prefectural Party committee and commissioner, Zhang Duo, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Yang Chujiang, the head of the Health Section of the special district, to Luxi County to conduct investigations, research, and interrogations, and urged the Luxi County Party Committee to conduct an examination. Currently, this incident is being handled.

I believe that the fact that the reactionary element Luo Shilin publicly persecuted cadres shows that the enemies of the revolution are always trying to attack the people. In addition to demanding that the People's Government severely punish the murderer Luo Shilin and avenge Comrade Dou Duanxiao, we must always redouble our political vigilance; and some Party and government leaders in Luxi County bear serious responsibility for the death of Comrade Dou Duanxiao. It is hoped that the Party and government leading organs of Yunnan Province will give them the punishment they deserve.

    反动分子混入国家机关公然残害革命干部
    泸西县某些党政领导干部竟知情坐视不管
    编辑同志：愤慨的感情强烈地激动着我，使我不得不写信向你们报告这一个令人十分痛心的事件。十一月六日云南日报刊载：该省泸西县卫生院院长罗时霖——一个混入国家机关里的反动分子，竟然在光天化日之下，明目张胆地用绝灭人性的罪恶手段，残杀了革命女干部窦端孝。而更使人愤怒和痛心的是：该县以中共县委书记牟梅生为首的不少党政领导干部已经知道了这件事，却可耻地坐视反动分子肆意行凶；事后又拖延不作严正处理。直到云南日报多次督促和中共云南省委追究后，这个事件才得到处理。现在我把这个事件的经过告诉你们。
    泸西县卫生院院长罗时霖，原为蒋介石匪军的中校军医官。解放后他的反动思想丝毫未改，并窃踞我人民卫生机关领导地位。他不服从县人民政府卫生科领导；工作一贯敷衍塞责，给农民看病更是草率应付。在机关中，他一贯进行破坏活动，公开辱骂共产党，拉拢部分落后分子打击要求进步的干部。他是一个贪污分子，“三反”运动中拒不坦白，并压制民主。就在轰轰烈烈的“三反”运动中，他竟明目张胆地残杀了革命女干部窦端孝。
    窦端孝是宜良专署卫生科的工作人员，一个热情而积极要求进步的十八岁的女青年。她被派到泸西县作种痘防疫工作，因为对罗时霖的违法行为和恶劣作风进行斗争，屡次遭受打击。“三反”运动中，她检举了罗时霖的贪污行为，并积极参加了
    “打虎”工作，罗时霖对她愈加怀恨。五月中旬，罗时霖拉拢机关中部分落后工作人员，利用替她做鉴定的机会，给她捏造了十四条缺点，并诬蔑她有不正当男女关系。罗时霖又藉口她曾进罗屋内翻东西，曾毒打她几次；并和她进行了五个半小时的“谈话”，肆意辱骂打击。在这一连串的刺激下，窦端孝终于神经失常。罗时霖不但不予诊治，反恶毒地说窦端孝是得了“色疯”，指使卫生训练班学员田利华、周癸祥两人用木棒将她毒打了一顿。接着，罗又将她捆绑后用铁链锁在厕所旁的大树下，任凭冻饿雨淋，并曾用灌马的竹筒给她灌了一次强烈泻药。两日后，窦端孝又被锁进厕所旁的一间屋子里。窦端孝在这种野蛮的摧残下，精神疲惫，虚弱不堪。这时，反革命分子罗时霖又进一步干出了毫无人性的罪行。五月二十六日下午，罗时霖指使
    一个“草药医生”，砍了一只公鸡的头，塞进窦端孝的阴道；接着，又将窦端孝用棉被包裹、里外捆绑。窦端孝丝毫不能翻动，混身出汗，继而昏迷不醒。这时罗时霖曾给窦端孝注射数次；五月二十七日晨三时，窦端孝即在罗时霖注射时气绝死去。死后经泸西县人民法院验尸证明：窦端孝十指呈青色，系中毒丧命。
    窦端孝虽然神经失常，但对反动分子的迫害始终坚持了斗争，对党满怀信心。她在被迫害致死的过程中，曾经不断地呼喊：“罗时霖是反动的；毛主席领导是正确的”。
    编辑同志：这样的事件，不仅发生在人民的国家里，而且是发生在我们的国家机关里；这实在是骇人听闻和不能容忍的。泸西县党政领导机关对这个事件的发生应该负严重的责任。罗时霖残害窦端孝致死，前后约经半月之久。在这期间，卫生院工作人员、青年团员黎汝能曾连续将真实情况反映给县人民政府并转告县委，但始终未见处理。县委宣传干事唐筱全（共产党员）见窦端孝因受罗时霖的侮辱刺激而神经开始错乱时，也曾向县委书记牟梅生反映，并建议给窦端孝以照顾；但牟梅生不表示意见。及至窦端孝被罗时霖侮蔑为“色疯”，锁在大树下任人“观看”时，牟梅生居然前往“观看”。同去的县人民政府税务局局长林大章（共产党员）曾向牟梅生提出：应将窦端孝送去休养，但牟梅生依然不处理。林大章也没敢坚持正确的意见。窦端孝被杀害后，县人民法院院长邵光华前去验尸，同去的还有县人民政府人事科长王明（共产党员）、县委组织干事沈迎春（共产党员），当时发现窦端孝是中毒丧命，但并未深究责任，只让罗时霖反省。事后，沈迎春和唐筱全向牟梅生反映了这一情况，而牟梅生反说：“冷静些，慢慢处理。”沈迎春和唐筱全很不满意，但不敢再坚持。县公安局副局长刘连三（共产党员）于事件发生后到任，曾请示牟梅生将罗时霖逮捕，牟梅生仍犹豫不处理。刘连三虽然不满，也未敢坚持。直到七月十日，时隔窦端孝被杀害一个半月，公安局才最后决定将罗时霖逮捕；而牟梅生则仍不主张逮捕。罗时霖被逮捕后，仅审讯了一、二次，全部案件并未及时处理。以上情况，牟梅生均未向上级党组织请示报告。此外，宜良专署卫生科长杨楚江（共产党员）于窦端孝事件发生时，也曾了解有关案件情况，但只是事先查问，事后掩埋，并未深究责任，也未向上级反映。
    六月份，云南日报编辑部接到读者来信，知道了这个情况，就连续写信让泸西县人民政府、中共宜良地委和中共泸西县委对这个事件进行调查并作处理，但始终未引起上述机关应有的重视，中共泸西县委虽对此事做了初步检讨，并组织了“窦端孝事件”处理委员会，但并未进行工作。县委书记牟梅生在县级机关干部大会上曾作了一次极不深刻的检讨，很多干部听后很不满意，但也没有机会发表意见。九月中旬，中共云南省委自报社了解这一情况后，立即打电话给宜良地委追究此事，并责成宜良地委迅速作严正处理。宜良地委这时才派地委委员、专员陈光逵，公安处长张铎和专署卫生科长杨楚江到泸西县进行调查、研究及审讯等工作，督促泸西县委进行检查。目前这个事件正在处理中。
    我认为，反动分子罗时霖公然残害干部的事实，说明革命的敌人是时时刻刻处心积虑地向人民进攻的。我们除了要求人民政府严惩凶手罗时霖，为窦端孝同志报仇外，还应该时时刻刻百倍提高我们的政治警惕性；而泸西县某些党政领导干部对窦端孝同志的死是负有严重责任的，希望云南省党政领导机关给他们以应得的处分。　文恬英
