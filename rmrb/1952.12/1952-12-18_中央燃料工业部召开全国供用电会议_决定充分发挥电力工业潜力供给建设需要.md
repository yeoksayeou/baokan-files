    The Ministry of Fuel Industry Convenes National Electricity Supply Conference
    Decides to Fully Exploit the Potential of the Electric Power Industry to Supply Construction Needs
    In order to meet the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin and fully supply the ever-growing electricity needs, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened a national electricity supply conference in Beijing from November 27th to December 2nd. More than 160 representatives from the industrial departments of the Central People's Government, the Financial and Economic Committees of major administrative regions and major cities, the trade union system, and electricity units from various regions attended the conference. The State Planning Commission of the Central People's Government also sent personnel to participate in guidance. At the meeting, Minister Chen Yu and Vice Minister Liu Lanbo gave important instructions on the general spirit and requirements of the meeting, pointing out that in the future, in addition to placing capital construction work in a primary position, it is also necessary to vigorously exploit the potential capacity of the electric power industry from all directions. Under the principle of safe production, the potential capacity of equipment should be fully utilized on the existing basis through strengthening maintenance, unified dispatch, adjusting loads, and using electricity rationally and economically. As long as electricity units and users cooperate closely, and the Party organizations, governments, and trade unions in various regions specifically promote it, it is estimated that the equipment utilization rate of the electricity industry in 1953 can be increased by about 20 percent compared with 1952.
    The conference focused on discussing maintenance issues (including the promotion of rapid maintenance methods), unified dispatch issues, load adjustment issues, rational and economical electricity use issues, electricity price issues, and the establishment of a power supply and use system that meets overall interests, and reached a consensus.
    Vice Minister Liu Lanbo made a concluding report at the conference, determining the task of exploiting the potential capacity of the electric power industry in 1953; and emphasized that to do this work well, it is necessary to strengthen the overall concept. The electricity bureau must take more responsibility in this regard, face production, and serve factories and mines; in particular, it is necessary to strive for the strong support of local leading institutions. At the end of the conference, award banners were presented to eight factories and mines in Northeast, Northwest, North China, and East China that had achieved success in saving electricity and using electricity rationally.

    中央燃料工业部召开全国供用电会议
    决定充分发挥电力工业潜力供给建设需要
    为了迎接即将开始的大规模经济建设，充分供给不断发展的电力需要，中央人民政府燃料工业部于十一月二十七日到十二月二日在北京召开了全国供用电会议。参加这次会议的有中央人民政府各工业部门、各大行政区及主要城市财政经济委员会、工会系统及各地区的电业单位代表共一百六十余人。中央人民政府国家计划委员会也派人参加指导。会上陈郁部长、刘澜波副部长对会议总的精神和要求作了重要指示，指出今后除把基本建设工作放在首要地位以外，还必须从四面八方来大力发挥电力工业潜在能力，要在安全生产的原则下，通过加强检修、统一调度、调整负荷、合理与节约用电等方法，在现有基础上充分发挥设备的潜在能力。只要电业单位和用户密切配合，各地党的组织、政府和工会各方面具体推动，估计一九五三年电业的设备利用率就可以比一九五二年提高百分之二十左右。
    会议着重讨论了检修问题（包括推广快速检修法）、统一调度问题、调整负荷问题、合理与节约用电问题、电价问题、建立符合整体利益的供用电制度问题等，并取得了一致的认识。
    大会由刘澜波副部长作总结报告，确定了一九五三年发挥电力工业潜在能力的任务；并着重指出要作好这个工作，必须加强整体观念，电业局在这一点上必须多负责任，面向生产，为厂矿服务；特别要争取地方领导机构的大力支持。大会最后对在节约电力、合理用电工作上有成绩的东北、西北、华北、华东的八个厂矿授予奖旗。
