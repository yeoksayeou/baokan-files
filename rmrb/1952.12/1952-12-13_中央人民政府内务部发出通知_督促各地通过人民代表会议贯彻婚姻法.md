    Xinhua News Agency: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government recently issued a notice to the civil affairs departments of people's governments at all levels across the country, urging all regions to discuss the implementation of the Marriage Law through people's representative conferences. The notice pointed out: In July 1952, the "Joint Directive on Continuing to Implement the Marriage Law" issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Justice stipulated that people's representative conferences at all levels and their consultative committees or standing committees must report and discuss the implementation and enforcement of the Marriage Law at their meetings, and report the results of the discussions level by level; however, to date, only a few regions have complied with this provision. To this end, the notice stipulates: People's governments above the provincial and municipal levels should urge their subordinate people's governments at all levels, especially county people's governments, to make special reports on the implementation of the Marriage Law at the people's representative conferences and their consultative committees or standing committee meetings in the future. The meetings should organize discussions on this issue, and the results of the discussions should be reported level by level. The notice also stipulates that all regions that have conducted or have not yet conducted reports and discussions must report the results of the discussions and the reasons for not conducting reports and discussions level by level.

    中央人民政府内务部发出通知
    督促各地通过人民代表会议贯彻婚姻法
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府内务部日前向全国各级人民政府民政部门发出通知，督促各地通过人民代表会议讨论贯彻婚姻法的工作。通知指出：一九五二年七月，中央人民政府内务部与司法部发布的“关于继续贯彻婚姻法的联合指示”中，曾规定各级人民代表会议及其协商委员会或常务委员会在开会时，必须在会上报告和讨论婚姻法的贯彻与执行情况，并将讨论结果逐级上报；但到目前为止，这一规定只有少数地区遵照执行。为此，通知规定：各省、市以上地方人民政府应督促其所属各级人民政府，特别是县人民政府，今后在人民代表会议及其协商委员会或常务委员会会议上，必须对贯彻婚姻法问题进行专题报告，会议对这一问题应组织讨论，并将讨论结果逐级上报。通知又规定：凡过去已经进行或尚未进行报告和讨论的地区，皆须将讨论结果及未进行报告和讨论的原因逐级报告。
