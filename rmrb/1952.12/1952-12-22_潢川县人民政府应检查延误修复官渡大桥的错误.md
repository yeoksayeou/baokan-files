    Huangchuan County People's Government Should Examine the Errors in Delaying the Repair of Guandu Bridge
    To the Editor: The Huangchuan County People's Government in Henan Province began constructing the Guandu Bridge project on the Huangchuan to Gushi highway in April 1951. Due to poor surveying and investigation, two bridge piers on the west end of the bridge collapsed within two months of completion. Therefore, it was decided to repair it. However, the Huangchuan County People's Government still did not pay enough attention to this project and handed the repair work over to the Construction and Surveying Section. The section sent people to Tianjin to purchase materials, but the materials were not fully purchased until March of this year, and construction did not begin until April of this year. However, there was a lot of rain in April, which caused the damming and river excavation project to collapse, wasting more than 10,000 catties of grain.
    In October of this year, the Huangchuan Special District allocated another 40 million yuan in construction funds to Huangchuan County, but the county delayed for a year and has not yet completed the project, accumulating state funds and affecting the county's material exchange and transportation development.
    I believe that the Huangchuan County People's Government's irresponsible and procrastinating style should be corrected quickly.

    潢川县人民政府应检查延误修复官渡大桥的错误
    编辑同志：河南潢川县人民政府在一九五一年四月开始修建潢川到固始公路的官渡大桥工程，由于没有很好地勘察和调查，在修竣后没有两个月，该大桥西头已有两座桥墩倒塌。因此，决定重新补修。但潢川县人民政府仍然不重视这个工程，把修复工程交给建勘科去做，该科派人到天津去购买材料，直到今年三月还没有把材料购齐，一直到今年四月才开工。但四月份又多雨，以致打坝挖河工程未完成，就被水冲垮了，浪费一万多斤粮食。
    今年十月，潢川专区又拨给潢川县四千万元工款，但该县延误了一年之久，至今尚未修好这个工程，积压了国家资金，也影响了该县物资交流和运输事业的发展。
    我认为潢川县人民政府这种不负责任的拖拉作风，应该迅速改正。      常景曾  陈爱书
