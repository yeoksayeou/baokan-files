　　Soviet People Love Chinese Literature and Art
    (Soviet Ovchinnikov)
    One evening, in the hall of the Central Cultural Palace of Railway Workers in Moscow, many people gathered. They were: readers of the Railway Workers' Cultural Palace Library, workers, students from Moscow universities, and some housewives. All these people came to participate in a reader symposium on the literature of New China.
    These ordinary Soviet people came to the podium one after another. They exchanged their impressions after reading Chinese books. Some recited poems dedicated to the brotherly Chinese people and their leader Mao Zedong. It can be seen that those who participated in the symposium were familiar with and loved the works of Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature, and the works of modern Chinese writers.
    Reader Vasilyeva talked about the national liberation struggle of the Chinese people reflected in Chinese literature. She talked about Yuan Jing and Kong Jue's novel "Heroes and Heroines" and Liu Baiyu's short stories.
    "The unity of the Chinese people and their army," she emphasized, "is so powerfully described in the works of Chinese writers that it cannot help but remind me of the years of our Great Patriotic War, thereby further deepening the Russian people's close feeling for their Chinese brothers."
    The great revolutionary reforms in the Chinese countryside—this was the theme of Comrade Muren, a railway worker. He pointed out the great value of Ding Ling's novel "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River" and Zhou Libo's novel "Hurricane" to Soviet readers.
    "The novels of Chinese writers," Muren said, "seem to open up a new world for us, allowing us to understand the character and life of the Chinese people, their history and their heroic present."
    Comrade Golovinov, a fitter and assembler, came to the podium.
    "The works of Chinese writers feel particularly close and easy for me to understand," he said. "After reading them, I am reminded of what I saw with my own eyes in China when I followed the Soviet army to fight against Japanese imperialism...."
    When commenting on the novel "Original Motivation," which describes the heroic daily labor of the Chinese working people, Golovinov said:
    "It is no accident that Cao Ming's novel is called 'Original Motivation.' Original motivation—this is the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, this is the infinite strength of the growing Chinese working class. Original motivation is the passion of labor, the desire for peace and creation. This force cannot be stopped by anything."
    Grebenikova, a student at the Railway Industry School, talked about the images of women in Chinese literary works. Construction worker Ivanov Saikov talked about the struggle for peace in Chinese poetry. At the end of the symposium, artists from the Moscow State Conservatory of Music also performed some Chinese musical pieces.
    Similar seminars, often held in cultural palaces, factory clubs, and libraries, are a clear proof of the growing interest of the Soviet people in China and its literature and culture.
    The Soviet Union publishes an increasing number of works by Chinese writers every year. The Soviet Union has published 118 collections and works by 33 Chinese writers. The total circulation of these books has exceeded 4.6 million copies. In addition to the Russian version, the works of Chinese writers have also been translated into 15 ethnic languages ​​of the Soviet Union. The works of Lu Xun alone have been published 15 times in the Soviet Union, with a total circulation of nearly 500,000 copies. The literature of brotherly China has won the love of the Soviet people. Therefore, they, along with the Chinese people, are also warmly celebrating the awarding of the Stalin Prize to writers Ding Ling and Zhou Libo and playwrights He Jingzhi and Ding Yi.
    It should be emphasized that not only modern Chinese literature, but also the outstanding works of past Chinese writers enjoy great prestige among the Soviet people. One hundred and sixty poems by the classical Chinese poet Bai Juyi have been translated into Russian and published. The first volume of the historical novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which is loved by the Chinese people, is also being prepared for publication. The Russian translation of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" has been published. On the Soviet stage, along with the opera "The White Haired Girl," the adapted play "Romance of the West Chamber" was successfully performed. When Chinese artists visited and performed in the Soviet Union, Soviet audiences highly appreciated the Chinese classical drama art and the treasures and characteristics of artistic expression that it has accumulated over hundreds of years. In the play "The Crossroads," the actors demonstrated perfect mastery of mime art and amazing musical talent and rhythm. Their every movement and gesture was exquisite and delicate.
    Soviet publications about China are increasing. From 1948 to the present, the Soviet Union has published more than 100 books on China's economy, history, geography, art, and other issues related to China, with a total circulation of about 4.5 million copies.
    In recent years, the Soviet people have become familiar with the excellent products of the young film industry of People's China. Chinese films are shown in our cinemas and have been very successful. The films that have been shown in the Soviet Union include: "Daughter of China," "Steel Warrior," "Radiance," "Invisible Front," "The White Haired Girl," "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," "Heroes and Heroines," etc. Several Chinese film festivals have been held in the Soviet Union. Before the opening, cinemas also held lectures and photo exhibitions about New China. During the Chinese Film Festival held last October, more than one million people watched Chinese films in Moscow alone in ten days. Soviet newspapers have made extensive reviews of every new Chinese film.
    In the Soviet Union, people have a strong interest in the color documentaries "Liberated China," "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains" and other films co-produced by Chinese and Soviet film workers.
    In recent times, cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet people have also expanded in music. The visit and performance of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe in the Soviet Union shattered the absurd "theory" of bourgeois artists that Chinese musical culture was "closed." This visit and performance showed that Russian classical music and Soviet music are loved by the Chinese people. The works of Chinese composers have been warmly welcomed in the Soviet Union.
    Now many Soviet choirs are singing Chinese songs, among which "The East is Red" is particularly loved. Violinist Galina Balinova often successfully plays Ma Sicong's pieces. Xian Xinghai's "Chinese Rhapsody," "Yellow River Chorus," and the works of Nie Er and He Luting are also often broadcast by radio.
    Soviet composers have created many works praising Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The Soviet people also highly value the excellent works of Chinese painting artists. In the Oriental Culture Museum, which displays a large number of works by Chinese artists, sculptors, and art pieces by bone tool, lacquerware, and gemstone carvers, many Muscovites come to visit every day. The "Chinese Culture and Art Exhibition" held by the Leningrad State Museum has also been a great success among the people of Leningrad.
    Currently, during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," reports and lectures are being held in some cities and villages in the Soviet Union, and photo exhibitions on the victories of the Chinese working people in building a new life and Sino-Soviet friendship are being held. Moscow Radio and the Central Television Station conducted special broadcasts on Chinese culture and art, including: talks on the creations of some of China's most famous writers, the performance of the radio drama "Li Youcai Speaks Out," the performance of "The White Haired Girl," the performance of literary and musical works, a concert of Chinese composers' works and folk songs, and Chinese films.
    Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges are developing and strengthening year by year. The unity and friendship between the brotherly people of China and the Soviet Union is being consolidated day by day. The further consolidation and development of this sincere friendship is a lasting cornerstone for defending peace in the Far East and the world.

　　苏联人民热爱中国文学艺术
    （苏联奥夫钦尼科夫）
    一天晚上，在莫斯科的铁路工人中央文化宫的大厅里，聚集着许多人。他们是：铁路工人文化宫图书馆的读者、工人、莫斯科高等学校的学生和一些家庭主妇。所有这些人，都是为了要参加一个关于新中国文学的读者座谈会而来的。
    这些普通的苏联人相继走上讲坛。他们彼此交换自己在读了中国书籍以后的感想。有一些人朗诵了他们献给亲如兄弟的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东的诗。可以看出，参加座谈会的人，对于鲁迅——中国新文学的奠基人的著作和现代中国作家的作品，是熟悉而且热爱的。
    读者华西列也娃讲述反映在中国文学中的中国人民的民族解放斗争。她谈到袁静、孔厥的小说《新儿女英雄传》和刘白羽的短篇小说。
    “中国人民和自己的军队的团结一致”，她着重地说，“在中国作家的作品中是有着如此有力的描写，因而不禁使我想起了我们伟大卫国战争的年代，并由此更加加深了俄罗斯人对中国兄弟的亲切感觉。”
    中国农村中的伟大的革命性的改革——这是铁路工人姆仁同志发言的主题。他指出了丁玲的小说《太阳照在桑朝乾河上》与周立波的小说《暴风骤雨》对于苏联读者所具有的重大价值。
    “中国作家们的小说”，姆仁说，“仿佛为我们打开了一个新世界，使我们认识到中国人民的性格和生活，他们的历史和英雄的现在。”
    钳工装配匠戈洛维诺夫同志走上了讲坛。
    “中国作家们的作品使我感到特别亲切和容易理解——他说，——读了它们以后，使我回想起当我随苏军一起打击日本帝国主义时在中国所亲眼看到的事情……。”
    在评介描写中国劳动人民的英雄的日常劳动的小说《原动力》时，戈洛维诺夫说：
    “草明的小说之所以名为《原动力》并不是偶然的。原动力——这就是中国共产党的英明领导，这就是增长着的中国工人阶级的无穷力量。原动力就是劳动的热情、对和平与创造的渴望。这种力量是任何事物都不能阻挡的。”
    铁路工业专科学校的学生格列别尼可娃谈到中国文学作品中的妇女形象。建筑工人伊万诺夫·赛科夫讲述了中国诗歌为和平而斗争的情形。在座谈会结束的时候，莫斯科国立音乐学院的艺术家们还演奏了一些中国的乐曲。
    在文化宫、工厂俱乐部、图书馆所经常举行的类似这样的座谈会，确凿地证明了苏联人民对于中国和它的文学、文化的日益增长的兴趣。
    苏联每年都在发行着更为大量的中国作家的作品。苏联已出版了三十三位中国作家的一百一十八种选集和著作。这些书籍的总发行量已超过了四百六十万册。中国作家的作品，除了俄文版外，还译成苏联十五种民族的文字。仅仅鲁迅一人的作品，在苏联就已出版了十五次，总发行数几达五十万册。兄弟中国的文学已赢得了苏联人的热爱。所以他们和中国人民一道，也在热烈地庆贺作家丁玲、周立波与剧作家贺敬之、丁毅的荣获斯大林奖金。
    应该着重指出，不仅是现代中国文学，而且中国过去的作家的优秀作品，也在苏联人中享有极大的声誉。中国古典诗人白居易的诗歌已有一百六十首译成俄文出版。为中国人民所喜爱的历史小说《三国演义》的第一卷，也在准备出版。《聊斋志异》的俄文译本已出版。在苏联的舞台上，与歌剧《白毛女》一起成功地演出的，还有经过改编的剧本《西厢记》。当中国艺术家在苏联访问演出时，苏联观众对于中国的古典戏剧艺术，对于它们在数百年来所积累起来的艺术表现手法的宝藏与特点，有着高度的评价。在《三岔口》一剧中，演员们表现了对哑剧艺术的完美掌握，表现了惊人的音乐天才和节奏。他们的每一个动作和手势都是精巧细腻的。
    苏联出版的关于中国的读物在增加着。从一九四八年到现在，苏联已出版了一百种以上关于中国的经济、历史、地理、艺术与其他有关中国问题的书籍，其总发行数已达四百五十万册左右。
    最近几年来，苏联人民又熟悉了人民中国的年轻电影事业的优秀出品。中国影片在我们的电影院放映，并很有成绩。在苏联，已经放映过的影片有：《中华女儿》、《钢铁战士》、《光芒万丈》、《无形的战线》、《白毛女》、《内蒙人民的胜利》、《新儿女英雄传》等。在苏联，举行过好几次中国电影展览节，在开映前，电影院还举行了有关新中国的演讲和图片展览。在去年十月举行的中国电影节中，仅仅在莫斯科一地，十天内就有一百多万人看了中国电影。苏联的报刊对每一部新中国的影片都作了广泛的评介。
    在苏联，人们对于由中苏两国电影工作人员合作摄制的彩色纪录片《解放了的中国》、《中国人民的胜利》、《锦绣山河》与其他影片都具有浓厚的兴趣。
    在最近时期内，中苏两国人民之间的文化交流，在音乐方面也扩大了。中国青年文工团在苏联的访问演出，粉碎了资产阶级艺术家们所谓仿佛中国音乐文化“闭塞”的荒谬“理论”。这次访问演出表明，俄罗斯古典音乐与苏联音乐是被中国人民所喜爱的。中国作曲家们的作品在苏联受到了热烈的欢迎。
    现在许多苏联合唱团都在演唱中国的歌曲，其中《东方红》特别被人喜爱。女提琴家珈利娜·巴利诺娃经常成功地演奏马思聪的曲子。冼星海的《中国狂想曲》、《黄河大合唱》，聂耳与贺绿汀的作品，也常常由电台予以广播。
    苏联作曲家们创作了许多歌颂中苏友谊的作品。
    苏联人对中国绘画艺术家们的优秀作品也给予高度的评价。在陈列有极多中国艺术家雕刻家的作品和骨器、漆器、宝石雕刻师的艺术品的东方文化博物馆中，每天有许多莫斯科人前来参观。列宁格勒国立博物馆所举办的“中国文化艺术展览会”，在列宁格勒人中也获得了极大的成功。
    目前，在“中苏友好月”期内，苏联的一些城市与乡村都在举行报告会、演讲会，举办关于中国劳动人民在建设新生活中的胜利与中苏友谊的照片展览会。莫斯科广播电台与中央电视广播台都进行了关于中国文化和艺术的特别广播节目，其中有：关于中国一些最著名作家的创作的讲话，《李有才板话》、《白毛女》的广播剧的上演，文学—音乐作品的演奏，中国作曲家们的作品与民歌的音乐会，中国电影。
    中苏文化交流逐年在发展与加强。中苏兄弟人民的团结与友谊正在日益巩固。这个真挚的友谊的进一步巩固与发展，是保卫远东与全世界和平的持久基石。
