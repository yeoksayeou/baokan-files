The People's Republic of Romania Celebrates its Fifth Anniversary

    Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Romania to China, Guo Zuowen

    The working people of the People's Republic of Romania today celebrate the fifth anniversary of their overthrow of the feudal monarchy and the founding of the People's Republic of Romania.

    Following the liberation of Romania by the glorious Soviet army on August 23, 1944, the overthrow of the feudal monarchy and the establishment of the People's Republic of Romania marked the victory of our people, led by the working class and its vanguard, the Romanian Workers' Party, in the struggle for the democratization of the country and the establishment of a people's democratic regime. Now, our country is advancing smoothly on the road of building the socialist economic base.

    The feudal monarchy, which had ruled Romania for a long time, was a stronghold of domestic reactionaries in our country and the most brutal tool for oppressing the people. After overthrowing the feudal monarchy and establishing a People's Republic based on the alliance of workers and peasants and led by the working class, the working people of our country have completely taken their destiny into their own hands. Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the people began to embark on the road of building a happy life and building socialism in the People's Republic of Romania.

    For our people, the People's Republic of Romania signifies the victory and realization of all rights and freedoms. For these, the outstanding sons and daughters of our people once fought, sacrificing their lives and freedom. Their sacrifices were not in vain; now we are free and masters of our homeland. The People's Republic of Romania means to us the most supreme rights and freedoms: our national independence, the right to manage ourselves according to the interests of the vast majority of the people, and the right to dispose of our country's resources and the fruits of its labor.

    The new Constitution of the People's Republic of Romania, adopted in September 1952, reflects all these victories of the Romanian people.

    Our people's democratic regime, as stipulated in the new Constitution, is manifested in the fact that all factories, resources, banks, and mines are state property, owned by all the people; the political and economic power of the state is in the hands of the working people of the cities and countryside; all minority nationalities enjoy full equal rights, resolutely opposing any theory of racial superiority, racial hatred, and national hatred; various rights and freedoms are not given to a few exploiters, but to the broad masses of the people; the rights to work, rest, material security for the elderly, education, and equality between men and women have become a reality in our daily life, guaranteed by the material living conditions created by the people's democratic regime.

    The elections held in 1948 and 1950, especially the elections to the National Assembly held on November 30, 1952—in which 98.84 percent of the total number of voters, or 10,233,369 people, voted to elect representatives of the People's Democratic Front—have clearly demonstrated the Romanian people's enthusiastic love for the people's democratic regime.

    The people's democratic regime has liberated the creativity of the working people and provided our people with the possibility of engaging in free labor for their own interests. This has become the source of the remarkable achievements we have obtained today and the guarantee for realizing the prospects that lie ahead of them.

    In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of Romania, the Romanian people have achieved remarkable achievements thanks to the correct Marxist-Leninist policies of the Romanian Workers' Party and the generous assistance of the Soviet Union in many aspects.

    The entire country has been transformed into a huge construction site, with new factories and new power stations being built everywhere. Because resources are owned by all the people, the country's resources are being utilized for the first time. In the past few years, dozens of factories have been established and put into operation; due to the establishment of new production departments, and at the same time, due to the implementation of technological improvements and the adoption of new working methods in the production process, the productivity of existing enterprises is increasing day by day.

    The current industrial output is equal to twice the highest level during the era of the bourgeois-landlord regime.

    The People's Republic of Romania now produces two and a half times more steel than before, and two and a half times more electricity; the power generation capacity built between 1950 and 1952 exceeds the power generation capacity installed in ten years during the bourgeois-landlord regime, and the production of cotton and woolen textiles has also increased by about two times compared to before.

    The people's democratic regime has established new production departments, such as the machine tool manufacturing industry, the oil and mining equipment industry, the electrical technology industry, the tractor and agricultural machinery industry, the textile machinery industry, the film industry, and others. Many of these industrial sectors have implemented mass production. For example, our tractor industry produced more than 10,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) between 1948 and 1952.

    As Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party and Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers, once said: "When the Romanian people begin to achieve the results of the country's socialist industrialization, they enter the stage of building socialism; when they feel the joy of free labor, they dedicate all their strength to the country's strength and prosperity, and to the continuous improvement of the people's happiness."

    The completion of the 1951 production plan and the completion of the 1952 plan one month ahead of schedule have created favorable conditions for increasing the tasks of the 1953 plan, the decisive year of the Five-Year Plan.

    The main task of the 1953 plan is to raise the entire industrial production of 1953 to the level originally stipulated to be reached in 1954. In this way, the Five-Year Plan can be completed ahead of schedule.

    In 1953, industrial production will reach a level equal to 124 percent of 1952; in particular, the production of means of production will increase significantly, with its output reaching 128 percent of the 1952 level.

    In 1953, the Seajor Jiu Bardur and Comaneesti thermal power stations and chemical coking plants, the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" thermal power station in Hunedoara, a bearing manufacturing factory in Moldova, five new cement factories, and many other factories will be put into operation.

    In 1953, a series of basic constructions of great importance to economic development will begin, such as: a steel plant, a new oil refinery and a thermal power station in Moldova, an aluminum manufacturing complex, a truck factory, and some new factories in various industrial sectors.

    In the People's Republic of Romania, construction is now underway that the Romanian people could not have imagined in the past, such as the Danube-Black Sea Canal, the "Lenin" Hydropower Station in Bicaz, the "Spark Building," and others.

    The Romanian people are vigorously engaged in new and huge construction projects, such as the socialist construction and reconstruction of our capital and major cities, the construction of the Bucharest subway, and the transformation of Bucharest into a seaport. After the Bucharest-Danube Canal is completed, Bucharest will be connected to the Black Sea via the Danube River.

    With the fraternal multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union, Romania, which used to be a backward agricultural country, has been transformed into a highly developed industrial country, and the proportion of industry occupies a dominant position in the country's entire economy.

    The agriculture of the People's Republic of Romania, which was backward in the past, is now equipped with tens of thousands of tractors and other agricultural machines, so that more laboring peasants can embark on the road of socialist agriculture according to their own wishes.

    The socialist sector in agriculture established by the people's democratic regime accounts for 16 percent of the total cultivated land.

    As of the beginning of November 1952, the People's Republic of Romania had a total of 1,650 collective farms and more than 1,700 mutual aid teams for cooperative farming.

    The increase in the number of collective farms and its organizational strengthening, the increase in machine and tractor stations, and the increase in the production of new tractors, harvesters, and other agricultural machines clearly indicate that the People's Republic of Romania is firmly advancing on the road of socialist transformation of agriculture, which is the only road for laboring peasants to get rid of poverty.

    In terms of commodity circulation, important achievements have also been made, especially after the implementation of currency reform at the beginning of 1952. In the year 1952, residents obtained 26 percent more consumer goods from state-owned and cooperative trade networks than in 1951.

    In Romania during the former old regime, the number of illiterate people almost reached four million. Now the situation is completely different. The People's Republic of Romania has become a country where the broad masses of people can fully enjoy the benefits of science, culture, and art. The number of illiterate people has been reduced to less than one million, and in the 1953-1954 academic year, illiteracy will be completely eliminated.

    This year, the number of students in primary schools exceeded 1.7 million, and the number of students in universities and other institutions of higher learning has increased from 28,000 in 1938 to 62,000 this year.

    In the past, most of the students came from the exploiting classes, but now the students mostly come from the working class, laboring peasants, staff, and intellectual strata.

    Our culture has greatly developed and has new socialist content. Important achievements have been made in literature, music, painting, sculpture, film, drama, and other arts. The people's democratic government gives writers, artists, sculptors, and scientists real help, creating particularly good material conditions for them to carry out their activities smoothly.

    All these achievements in politics, economy, society, and culture reflect the tremendous enthusiasm of the Romanian people for peaceful and creative labor. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej once pointed out, "This is a clear proof of our people's strong desire for peace. Only people who truly desire peace, only people who firmly believe that peace can be defended, can engage in and complete such grand plans as we have realized in our lives." The hope and confidence of our people and the people of the world in striving for world peace and blocking the path of the instigators of new wars are based on the fact that the leader of the forces of peace is the unshakable Soviet Union headed by the great Stalin.

    Our alliance and friendship with the great Soviet Union is the most powerful guarantee for the freedom, independence, and peace of our people.

    Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and its leader Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Romanian people are advancing with unwavering confidence on the road of building socialism, the road indicated by Comrades Lenin and Stalin.

    The Romanian people watch with great love the heroic struggle of the great Chinese people under the leadership of its wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong to defend the security of the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East. This struggle is an integral part of the active struggle of the entire world peace and democracy camp led by the powerful Soviet Union.

    The Romanian people warmly congratulate the fraternal Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in politics, economy, culture, and society in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. These achievements enable the new China to rapidly implement a planned economy and large-scale basic construction.

    For three years, the friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of Romania and the People's Republic of China has been strengthened and is continuing to strengthen. The cultural cooperation agreement signed at the end of 1951, the economic agreement signed in 1952, the strengthening of cultural exchanges, and many other measures have made our friendly cooperation and exchange of experience relations closer.

    On the occasion of celebrating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Romania today, the Romanian people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on the outstanding achievements they have made under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, and regard these achievements and merits as the strengthening and consolidation of the peace and democracy camp under the leadership of the great Stalin.

    罗马尼亚人民共和国成立五周年
    罗马尼亚人民共和国驻华特命全权大使　郭佐文
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民，今天庆祝他们推翻封建王朝和成立罗马尼亚人民共和国的五周年。
    在光荣的苏联军队于一九四四年八月二十三日解放罗马尼亚以后，封建王朝的被推翻和罗马尼亚人民共和国的成立，标志着以工人阶级为首的我国人民在工人阶级的先锋队罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，争取国家民主化和人民民主政权的胜利。现在，我国正在顺利地建设社会主义经济基础的道路上前进。
    在罗马尼亚曾经统治了很久的封建王朝，是我国国内反动派的一个堡垒，也是压迫人民的最残暴的工具。在推翻了封建王朝与建立了以工农联盟为基础、以工人阶级为领导的人民共和国以后，我国劳动人民就把自己的命运完全掌握在自己手里了。在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，人民开始走上了建设幸福生活和在罗马尼亚人民共和国建设社会主义的道路。
    对于我国人民来说，罗马尼亚人民共和国意味着一切权利和自由的胜利和实现。为了它们，我国人民的优秀儿女曾经不惜自己的生命与自由而战斗过。他们的牺牲并不是徒然的；现在我们已经自由并成为我们祖国的主人。罗马尼亚人民共和国对于我们就是最崇高的权利和自由：我国的民族独立，按照最大多数人民的利益来支配自己的权利，处置我国富源和它的劳动成果的权利。
    在一九五二年九月通过的罗马尼亚人民共和国新宪法，反映了罗马尼亚人民所有的这些胜利。
    我国的人民民主政权，如新宪法所规定那样，表现于这样的事实：一切工厂、资源、银行与矿山都是国家的财产，属于全民所有；国家的政治与经济权力掌握在城乡劳动人民手里；各少数民族享有完全的平等权利，坚决反对任何种族优秀论、种族仇恨与民族仇恨；各种权利和自由不是给予少数剥削者，而是给予广大的人民群众；劳动、休息、老年人的物质保障、受教育等权利和男女平等，在我国的日常生活中已成为事实了，已被人民民主政权所创造的物质生活条件所保障了。
    在一九四八年与一九五○年举行的选举，特别是在一九五二年十一月三十日举行的国民议会选举——这次选举有选民总数的百分之九十八点八四，即一千零二十三万三千三百六十九人，投票选举人民民主阵线的代表——已清楚地表明了罗马尼亚人民对于人民民主政权的热烈爱戴。
    人民民主政权已解放了劳动人民的创造力，并给我国人民提供了为自己的利益而从事自由劳动的可能。这已成为我们今天所获得的卓越成就的源泉，和实现展现在他们前面的远景的保证。
    在罗马尼亚人民共和国成立五年以来，由于罗马尼亚工人党的正确的马克思—列宁主义政策与苏联多方面的慷慨援助，罗马尼亚人民已获得了显著的成就。
    整个国家已经变成为一个巨大的建筑现场，新的工厂，新的电力站已在各地建立起来。由于资源已属于全民所有，国家的资源才第一次被利用了。在过去几年内，数十个工厂已经建立起来并且开了工；由于建立了新的生产部门，同时由于在生产过程中实行了技术改进和采用了新的工作方法，现有企业的生产力正日益扩大。
    现在的工业生产量已等于资产阶级——地主政权时代最高水平的二倍。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国现在所生产的钢较前增加了两倍半，电力增加了两倍半；在一九五○至一九五二年建立起来的发电能力，超过了资产阶级——地主政权时代十年内所装置的发电能力，棉织品与毛织品的生产也较从前增加了大约二倍。
    人民民主政权已建立了新的生产部门，如机器工具制造业，采油与采矿设备工业，电气技术工业，拖拉机与农业机器工业，纺织机器工业，电影工业与其他等等。许多这些工业部门已经实行大量生产。如我国的拖拉机工业，在一九四八年至一九五二年之间曾生产了一万多架的拖拉机（每架以十五匹马力计算）。
    正如罗马尼亚工人党总书记、罗马尼亚部长会议主席乔治乌—德治同志曾经说过的：“当罗马尼亚人民开始取得了国家社会主义工业化的成果以后，他们就进入了建设社会主义的阶段；当他们感到了自由劳动的愉快的时候，他们就为祖国的强盛与繁荣，为人民幸福的不断增进而献出了他们的一切力量。”
    一九五一年生产计划的完成与一九五二年计划的提前一个月完成，已经为增加一九五三年——五年计划的决定性一年的计划的任务创造了有利条件。
    一九五三年计划的主要任务是：把一九五三年的整个工业生产提高到原来规定于一九五四年达到的水平。这样，五年计划就能够提前完成了。
    在一九五三年，工业生产将达到等于一九五二年的百分之一百二十四的水平；特别是生产手段的生产要大大增加，它的产量要达到一九五二年水平的百分之一百二十八。
    一九五三年，在赛乔尔裘·柏杜尔和康曼聂什底的热力发电站与化学炼焦厂、洪尼多阿拉的“乔治乌—德治”热力发电站、摩尔多瓦的一个轴承制造工厂，五个新水泥工厂和许多别的工厂都要开工。
    在一九五三年，将要开始一系列对于经济的发展有着巨大重要性的基本建设，如：一个炼钢厂，一个新的炼油厂和在摩尔多瓦的热力发电站，一个制铝联合工厂，一个卡车工厂和一些各种工业部门的新工厂。
    在罗马尼亚人民共和国，现在正在进行着罗马尼亚人民在过去所不能想像的建设，如多瑙河—黑海运河，比卡兹的“列宁”水电站，“火花大厦”与其他等等。
    罗马尼亚人民正在大力从事于新的巨大建设工程，如我国首都和各大城市的社会主义建设与重建，布加勒斯特地下铁道的建设，布加勒斯特的改建为海港等。在建成布加勒斯特—多瑙河运河以后，布加勒斯特就会经由多瑙河而与黑海相通。
    在苏联兄弟般的多方面的帮助之下，过去是一个落后的农业国家的罗马尼亚已经转变成为一个工业十分发达的国家了，工业的比重在国家的整个经济中已占着优势。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的农业，在过去是落后的，现在则已配备了几万架拖拉机和其他农业机器，这样，就能使得更多的劳动农民可以根据他们自己的意愿，走上社会主义农业的道路。
    由人民民主政权所建立起来的农业中的社会主义部分，占全部耕地的百分之十六。
    在一九五二年十一月初，罗马尼亚人民共和国共有一千六百五十个集体农场和一千七百个以上的共耕互助组。
    集体农场数目的增加和它的组织上的加强，机器与拖拉机站的增加，以及新式拖拉机、收割机和其他农业机器产量的增加，清楚地表明了：罗马尼亚人民共和国正坚定地在农业社会主义改造的道路上前进，这条道路是劳动农民摆脱贫困的唯一道路。
    在商品流通方面，特别是在一九五二年初实行货币改革以后，也获得了重要的成就。在一九五二年一年内，居民从国营与合作社贸易网获得了较一九五一年多百分之二十六的消费品。
    在从前旧政权时代的罗马尼亚，文盲的数目几乎达到四百万人，现在情形完全不同了，罗马尼亚人民共和国已经成为这样的一个国家，那里的广大人民群众已能充分地享受到科学、文化与艺术的利益。文盲的数目已减至一百万人以下，在一九五三—一九五四年的学年内，文盲将被全部肃清。
    今年，初等学校的学生人数超过了一百七十万，大学与其他高等学校的学生人数已从一九三八年的二万八千人增加到今年的六万二千人。
    在过去，学生中的大部分是来自剥削阶级的，但现在的学生则大都来自工人阶级、劳动农民、职员与知识分子的阶层。
    我国的文化已有极大的发展，并具有新的社会主义的内容。在文学、音乐、绘画、雕刻、电影、戏剧与其他艺术方面，已得到了重要的成就。人民民主政府给予作家、艺术家、雕刻家、科学家以真正的帮助，为他们顺利进行自己的活动创设了特别良好的物质条件。
    所有这些在政治、经济、社会与文化方面所获得的成就，反映了罗马尼亚人民的和平与创造性劳动的巨大的热情。乔治乌—德治同志曾经指出，“这是我国人民要求和平的强烈愿望的明证。只有真正要求和平的人们，只有坚信和平能够保卫的人们，才能从事与完成像我们在生活中所实现的那样宏大的计划”。我国人民和全世界人民为争取世界和平和阻止新战争挑拨者的道路而斗争的希望与信心，是建立于这一事实的基础上的，即和平力量的领导者就是以伟大斯大林为首的不可动摇的苏联。
    我国和伟大苏联的联盟与友谊，是我国人民自由、独立与和平的最有力的保证。
    罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党及其领袖乔治乌—德治同志的领导下，满怀着坚定不移的信心，正在建设社会主义的道路、列宁和斯大林同志所指示的道路上前进。
    罗马尼亚人民怀着极大的热爱注视着伟大中国人民在它的英明领袖毛泽东主席领导之下进行的保卫祖国安全以及保卫远东和平的英勇斗争。这一斗争，是以强大苏联为首的、整个世界和平民主阵营积极斗争的不可分割的一部分。
    罗马尼亚人民以热烈的同情祝贺兄弟的中国人民在中华人民共和国成立三年来在政治、经济、文化与社会方面所取得的伟大成就。这些成就使得新中国能够迅速地实行计划经济和大规模的基本建设。
    三年来，罗马尼亚人民共和国与中华人民共和国之间的友谊与合作，已经加强并正在继续加强。在一九五一年底签订的文化合作协定、一九五二年签订的经济协定，文化交流的加强和其他许多措施，使得我们的友好合作和交流经验的关系更加密切起来。
    罗马尼亚人民在今天庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国成立五周年之际，热烈祝贺伟大中国人民在毛泽东主席领导之下所获得的杰出成就，并把这些成就和功绩，看作是在以伟大斯大林为首的苏联领导下的和平民主阵营的加强与巩固。
