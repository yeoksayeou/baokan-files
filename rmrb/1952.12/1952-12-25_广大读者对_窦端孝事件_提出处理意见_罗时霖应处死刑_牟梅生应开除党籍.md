Broad Masses of Readers Offer Opinions on the "Dou Duanxiao Incident"
    Luo Shilin Should Be Sentenced to Death; Mou Meisheng Should Be Expelled from the Party

    The broad masses of readers continue to send letters to this newspaper, offering their opinions on the handling of the "Dou Duanxiao Incident." As of December 23rd, we had received a total of 200 letters from 898 readers and 23 units. These letters came from Beijing and Tianjin in North China, and Hebei, Suiyuan, and Shanxi provinces; Xi'an and Shaanxi Province in Northwest China; Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, and other cities, and Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces in Northeast China; Shanghai and Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces in East China; Guangzhou and Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces in Central and Southern China, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The readers who wrote included workers, shop assistants, cadres of industrial and mining enterprises, and trade union workers; officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, and personnel of public security organs; cadres of Party and League organizations, mass organizations, and state organs; students, educators, and health workers; and other urban and rural working people and people of minority nationalities.

    These letters further demonstrate the serious attention paid by the broad masses to the "Dou Duanxiao Incident." The entire student body of the Tangshan Workers' Accelerated Middle School and the fifteen cadres of the Fengsheng Road Police Station of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau stated in their letters that they had all conducted discussions on the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" within their units. The worker reading group in Chengguan, Shangyi County, Hebei Province, read the report on the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" twice, and all members felt extremely indignant. The directly affiliated branch of the Public Security Sub-bureau of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau held a branch meeting on December 13th, and also invited the masses to participate, to discuss the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" and study this newspaper's "Brief Review of Readers' Letters." Why do readers attach such importance and attention to the "Dou Duanxiao Incident"? Many letters answered this question. The "Dou Duanxiao Incident" is a tragic event in which reactionary elements harmed revolutionary cadres and attacked the people because some of our leading cadres had disarmed themselves politically, lost their revolutionary stance, and ordinary cadres failed to adhere to principles. We should learn lessons and be educated from this bloody event to strengthen our political nature and adherence to principles, and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

    In the letters we continued to receive, all readers agreed with the readers' opinions comprehensively published on the "Readers' Letters Page" on December 18th, demanding that Luo Shilin, the murderer who harmed Comrade Dou Duanxiao, be sentenced to death. Many readers also praised Comrade Dou Duanxiao's spirit of unyielding perseverance in justice and resolved to learn from her. All Party members of the directly affiliated branch of the Public Security Sub-bureau of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the non-Party comrades who participated in the discussion of the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" unanimously demanded that the reactionary element Luo Shilin be shot to death and later used to honor martyr Dou Duanxiao. In letters from all comrades of the Linyu County Health Center in Hebei Province, it was suggested that the Luxi County People's Government hold a meeting to mourn Comrade Dou Duanxiao and provide compensation to her family.

    Many readers felt boundless anger and heartache at the shameful behavior of Mou Meisheng, Secretary of the Luxi County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, for condoning the reactionary elements' harm to revolutionary cadres. Readers' letters said that when they thought of the tragic death of Comrade Dou Duanxiao, they hated from the bottom of their hearts this "County Party Committee Secretary" Mou Meisheng, who sat idly by while reactionary elements harmed revolutionary cadres, even shamelessly went to "watch," and afterwards said to be "calmer, handle it slowly," without a trace of the character of a Communist Party member. They said: As long as Mou Meisheng still had a little thought for the interests of the people and the interests of the revolution, as long as Mou Meisheng still had a little revolutionary conscience and the sense of justice that every person should have, he would have been aroused to righteous indignation by the atrocities of the reactionary elements. Then the conspiracy of the reactionary element Luo Shilin would not have succeeded, and Comrade Dou Duanxiao would not have died tragically. But what is infuriating is that Mou Meisheng was so polite to the enemies of the revolution, but so cruel to revolutionary cadres! Readers all agreed with the opinion in this newspaper's "Brief Review of Readers' Letters" on December 10th, namely, "There is every reason to say that Mou Meisheng and others adopted an inexcusable and sinful attitude of condoning and supporting the crime of counter-revolutionary elements killing revolutionary cadres in essence." They suggested that Mou Meisheng must be expelled from the Party and punished according to law. Comrades Wang Junshi, Pang Zimei, and Chen Wengang of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers wrote: "If Mou Meisheng is not expelled from the Party and punished according to law, the prestige and interests of the Party that he has damaged cannot be restored, the people's anger cannot be appeased, and the entire Party cannot be effectively educated."

    Regarding the punishment of other derelict cadres, the opinions put forward by the readers are consistent with the opinions comprehensively published on the "Readers' Letters Page" on December 18th. In addition, some readers pointed out that the Yiliang Prefectural Committee received the letter from the Yunnan Daily requesting the handling of this incident a long time ago, but did not deal with it seriously; it was not until the Yunnan Provincial Committee inquired that it sent someone to handle it. This kind of bureaucracy is also not allowed, they should conduct a public self-criticism and earnestly correct it in future work.

    We believe that the above opinions of the readers are correct. Mou Meisheng's mistakes are indeed very serious and he has completely lost the most basic conditions of being a Communist Party member and should be expelled from the Party. We agree with the readers' demands and suggest that the Yunnan Provincial Committee handle this issue seriously. The bureaucratic style shown by the Yiliang Prefectural Committee in handling this incident is serious. Although they have already made a public self-criticism in the Yunnan Daily on November 6th, they should earnestly correct their mistakes in future work. Finally, we hope that the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yunnan Provincial People's Government will promptly handle this incident and announce the results.

### 广大读者对“窦端孝事件”提出处理意见  罗时霖应处死刑  牟梅生应开除党籍

专栏：

    广大读者对“窦端孝事件”提出处理意见
    罗时霖应处死刑  牟梅生应开除党籍
    广大读者继续给本报来信，提出对“窦端孝事件”的处理意见。到十二月二十三日为止，我们已收到了八百九十八位读者和二十三个单位的来信共二百件。这些信件来自华北的北京市、天津市和河北、绥远、山西各省。西北的西安市和陕西省，东北的沈阳、抚顺、鞍山等市和辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江各省，华东的上海市和山东、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建各省，中南的广州市和河南、湖南、江西、广东各省，以及内蒙古自治区。来信的读者有工人、店员、工矿企业的干部和工会工作者，有志愿军、解放军的指战员和公安机关的工作人员，有党团组织、群众团体和国家机关的干部，有学生、教育工作者和卫生工作者；此外还有其它城乡劳动人民和少数民族人民。
    这一些来信更进一步地表现了广大群众对“窦端孝事件”的严重注意。唐山市工人速成中学全体同学和青岛市公安局丰盛路派出所十五个干部的来信中都说，他们单位内都对“窦端孝事件”进行了讨论。河北尚义县城关工人读报组把“窦端孝事件”的报道读了两遍，全体组员都感到十分激愤。郑州铁路分局公安分处直属支部在十二月十三日召开支部大会，还邀请群众参加，讨论“窦端孝事件”并学习本报的“读者来信简评”。为什么读者们对
    “窦端孝事件”这样重视和注意呢？很多来信中都答复了这个问题。“窦端孝事件”是因为我们某些领导干部解除了政治武装、丧失了革命立场以及一般干部不能坚持原则而造成的反动分子残害革命干部、向人民进攻的惨痛事件。我们应该从这个血的事件中吸取教训、受到教育，来加强我们的政治性和原则性，进一步巩固人民民主专政制度。
    在我们继续收到的来信中，所有读者都同意十二月十八日“读者来信专页”上综合发表的读者意见，要求将残害窦端孝同志的凶手罗时霖处以死刑。很多读者也表扬了窦端孝同志不屈地坚持正义的精神，并决心向她学习。郑州铁路局公安分处直属支部全体党员和参加讨论“窦端孝事件”的非党同志一致要求枪决反动分子罗时霖后来祭窦端孝烈士。河北临榆县卫生院全体同志等的来信中建议泸西县人民政府开会追悼窦端孝同志，并对她的家属进行抚恤。
    很多读者对中共泸西县县委书记牟梅生纵容反动分子残害革命干部的可耻行为感到无比的愤怒和痛心。读者来信说，他们一想起窦端孝同志被残害的惨状，就从心底里憎恨这个坐视反动分子残害革命干部，甚至还无耻地去“观看”，而事后还说要“冷静些，慢慢处理”的毫无一点共产党员气味的“县委书记”牟梅生。他们说：只要牟梅生心里还想到一点人民利益和革命利益，只要牟梅生还有一点革命的良心和每一个人民应有的正义感，就会对反动分子的暴行激起义愤。而反动分子罗时霖的阴谋就不能得逞，窦端孝同志就不会惨痛牺牲。但令人气愤的是，牟梅生竟对革命的敌人这样客气，而对革命干部却是这样残酷！读者们都同意本报十二月十日“读者来信简评”中的意见，即“完全有理由说：牟梅生等对反革命分子杀害革命干部的罪行，在实质上是采取了纵容和支持的不可饶恕的罪恶态度。”他们建议，必须开除牟梅生的党籍，并依法惩办。志愿军某部王君奭、庞子美、陈文刚三同志来信说：“不开除牟梅生的党籍并依法惩办，就不能挽回被他损害了的党的威信和利益，就不能平民愤，就不能有效地教育全党。”
    对于其他失职干部的处分问题，读者们提出的意见和十二月十八日“读者来信专页”上综合发表的意见是一致的。此外，还有一部分读者提出，宜良地委很早就接到云南日报要求处理这个事件的信，但却不认真处理；直到云南省委查问时，才派出专人去处理。这种官僚主义也是不能允许的，他们应该公开进行检讨并在今后工作中切实改正。
    我们认为：读者上述意见是正确的。牟梅生的错误确实十分严重，已经完全丧失了作为一个共产党员的起码条件，应该开除他的党籍。我们同意读者的要求，并建议云南省委严正处理这个问题。宜良地委在处理这个事件时所表现的官僚主义作风是严重的。他们在十一月六日云南日报上虽已作了公开检讨，但还应该在今后工作中切实改正错误。最后，我们希望中共云南省委和云南省人民政府迅速处理这一事件并将结果公布。
