Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 5th: On the heroic "Heartbreak Ridge" of the Korean People's Army on the eastern front, another flag from China has been added. This is a Young Pioneer flag jointly presented to the Korean People's Army by the primary school students of the Second District Central Primary School and Baojia Street and Dongtiejiang Primary Schools in Beijing.

The soldiers stationed on the heroic "Heartbreak Ridge" had previously achieved brilliant victories under the inspiration of two red flags presented by the female students of Chongqing Women's Normal School and Hubei Provincial First Women's Middle School. This time, the soldiers will use new victories to seize this red flag sent by the children of Beijing, in order to repay the love and hope of the Chinese children for them.

One night, the Cui Changdao platoon accepted the combat mission of counterattacking the nameless high ground in front of "Heartbreak Ridge." Every soldier wrote down a battle resolution, full of spirit. Under the cover of artillery fire, they bravely charged into the enemy's position, and then repelled ten enemy counterattacks, eliminating more than 230 enemies in total.

In the battle, the soldiers showed amazing bravery. Platoon leader Li Zhengfeng's left leg was wounded. He quickly bandaged the wound and continued to fight. Later, his head was broken by a grenade, and his face and chest were covered with blood. He bandaged it again and continued to throw grenades at the enemy, encouraging his comrades, saying, "We must not forget the love of the Chinese children, we must fight to the end!" At this time, a bullet wounded his right eye, and five enemies rushed towards him. But the heroic Li Zhengfeng did not fall. He endured the severe pain and stood up from the trench, killing all five enemies before his eyes.

The Cui Changdao platoon won the red flag with its glorious victory. After the battle, they hung it in the fortifications of their platoon's position, and they were determined to fight even more bravely to defend the happiness of millions of children.

    朝鲜人民军某部在东部前线展开杀敌竞赛
    回答赠送红旗的中国小朋友们的热爱和希望
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】在东部前线朝鲜人民军的英雄阵地——“伤心岭”上，又增添了一面来自中国的旗子。这是北京市第二区中心小学和鲍家街、东铁匠小学的小学生们联合送给朝鲜人民军的一面少年儿童队的队旗。
    坚守在英雄阵地“伤心岭”上的战士们，过去曾经在重庆女子师范学校和湖北省立第一女子中学的女同学们赠送的两面红旗的鼓舞下取得了辉煌的胜利，这次战士们又用新的胜利来夺取北京市小朋友们送来的这面红旗，以回答中国小朋友们对他们的热爱和希望。
    一天晚上，崔昌道排接受了反击“伤心岭”前沿无名高地的战斗任务，每个战士都精神百倍地写下了战斗的决心书。他们在炮火的掩护下勇猛地杀上敌人的阵地，接着又打退敌人十次反扑，前后消灭敌人二百三十多名。
    在战斗中，战士们表现了惊人的勇敢。班长李正峰的左腿负了伤，他很快地包扎好伤口又继续战斗。后来他的头又被手榴弹炸破了，脸上胸上都是鲜血，他又包扎了一下，继续向敌人投掷手榴弹，并且鼓励他的战友们说：“我们不能忘了中国小朋友们的热爱，要坚决打到底！”这时有一颗子弹又打伤了他的右眼，并且有五个敌人向他冲来。但英勇的李正峰没有倒下，他忍着剧痛从交通沟里站了起来，把五个敌人全部打死在他的眼前。
    崔昌道排以自己光辉的胜利夺到了红旗。战后，他们把它挂在本排阵地的工事里，并且决心为了保卫千百万孩子们的幸福而更加英勇地战斗。
