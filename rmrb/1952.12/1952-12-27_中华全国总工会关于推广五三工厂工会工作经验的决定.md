    Our national economy has been fully restored, the transformation stage of state-owned enterprises has ended, and a new large-scale economic construction is about to begin. How to organize and mobilize the nation's workers to consciously fulfill and overfulfill the national economic plan, continuously improve labor productivity, rapidly increase China's industrial production, and support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is a very complex and arduous great historical task facing the working class's broadest mass organization—the trade union. Over the past three years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the efforts of trade union cadres at all levels, trade union work has made achievements. However, the actual state of trade union organizations, whether in terms of ideology, organization, or practical work experience, still cannot keep up with the urgent demands of the current objective situation. Therefore, focusing on the grassroots level, greatly strengthening grassroots trade union work, and creating a complete set of grassroots work experiences are the most central and practical tasks for trade union organizations to meet the country's large-scale economic construction, and also the basic key to strengthening trade union work.
    The Northeast "May 3rd" Factory provides us with a good example of a grassroots organization. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the support and cooperation of the administration and the Communist Youth League, the trade union organization of this factory implemented the Party's line and the working methods of relying on the worker masses, closely contacted the masses, and continuously improved the class consciousness of the workers. As a result, it has consistently overfulfilled the various indicators of the national production plan for the past three years; and on the basis of developing production, it has continuously improved the working conditions, material life, and cultural life of the workers, and has gained relatively complete work experience. The practice of popularizing these experiences in factories and mines in the Northeast region has proven to be good, and it has practical educational significance for trade union organizations in various places, and it is worthy of study and promotion in various places. In order to popularize the work experience of the "May 3rd" Factory Trade Union in grassroots organizations across the country, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided:
    1. Trade union organizations at all levels across the country, especially leading cadres of trade union organizations above the provincial and municipal levels, must conscientiously study the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, study the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on leadership methods and other relevant documents, clarify the basic ideas of the work experience of the "May 3rd" Factory Trade Union, combine with the actual situation, identify the key problems in grassroots work in their respective industries and regions, study them with reference to the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, and systematically and step by step solve them.
    2. Trade union organizations in large administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities should, according to the specific situation, hold short-term training classes for grassroots leading cadres, teach the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, and combine with the actual situation of their own factories to conduct inspections and summaries, formulate specific methods for improving work with reference to the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, and implement them.
    3. Industrial unions and local trade unions above the provincial and municipal levels should, after obtaining the consent of the local Party committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and in coordination with the administrative and Youth League organizations, establish a lean and strong working group, select one or two appropriate factories as the focus for promoting the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, personally take charge, gain experience, cultivate typical examples in different industries in the region, set examples, and gradually promote them in a planned way, and promptly conduct inspections and summaries.
    4. In order to promote the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, it is necessary to unify the leadership thinking of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and it is necessary to continuously struggle against conservative thinking appearing in various forms; at the same time, it is necessary to prevent the unrealistic practice of mechanically copying without considering the specific conditions. We must overcome all difficulties and resolutely implement it to the end.
    5. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions will uniformly print and distribute the materials and documents introducing the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory, and compile textbooks for grassroots cadres; the Workers' Daily, "China's Labor Movement," and newspapers and periodicals published by trade union organizations in various places should systematically publicize the experience of the grassroots organizations of the "May 3rd" Factory and the situation and experience of its promotion.
    6. Trade union organizations in various industries, large administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities should formulate plans for promoting the work experience of the "May 3rd" Factory and report them to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

    中华全国总工会关于推广五三工厂工会工作经验的决定
    我国国民经济已经完全恢复，国营企业的改造阶段已经结束，新的大规模的经济建设即将开始。如何组织与动员全国职工，自觉地完成与超额完成国家经济计划，不断地提高劳动生产率，使我国工业生产迅速地增长起来，并支援抗美援朝的斗争，这是摆在工人阶级最广泛的群众组织——工会面前的十分复杂而艰巨的伟大历史任务。全国工会工作三年来在中国共产党的领导和各级工会干部的努力下是有成绩的，可是工会组织的实际状况，无论在思想上、组织上与实际工作经验上都还赶不上当前客观形势的迫切要求。因此面向基层，大大地加强工会基层工作，创造一套完备的基层工作经验，是工会组织迎接国家大规模经济建设的最中心最实际的任务，也是加强工会工作的基本关键。
    东北五三工厂，给我们提供了一个基层组织的良好榜样。该厂工会组织，在中国共产党的领导下，在行政和青年团的支持与配合之下，贯彻了党的路线和依靠工人群众的工作方法，紧密地联系群众，不断地提高职工群众的阶级觉悟，从而三年来一贯地超额完成国家生产计划的各项指标；并在发展生产的基础上，不断地改善了职工的劳动条件、物质生活与文化生活，取得了比较完备的工作经验。这些经验在东北地区厂矿企业中推广的实践证明是好的，对各地工会组织来说也都有实际的教育意义，都值得各地学习与推广。中华全国总工会为了在全国基层组织中，推广五三工厂工会工作经验，特决定：
    一、全国各级工会组织，首先是省、市以上的工会组织的领导干部，必须认真研究五三工厂的经验，学习中共中央关于领导方法的决定及其他有关文件，明确五三工厂工会工作经验的基本思想，结合实际情况，找出本产业、本地区基层工作中的关键问题，参照五三工厂的经验，加以研究，系统地有步骤地予以解决。
    二、大行政区、省、市工会组织，根据具体情况，分别召开基层领导干部短期训练班，讲授五三工厂经验，并结合本厂实际情况，进行检查总结，参照五三工厂经验，订出改进工作的具体办法，并贯彻执行。
    三、省、市以上的产业工会与地方工会，应在取得当地中国共产党党委的同意后，协同行政与青年团的组织，成立精干有力的工作组，选择一、二个适当的工厂，作为推广五三工厂经验的重点，亲自掌握，取得经验，培养本地区不同产业的典型，树立榜样，并有计划地逐步推广，及时检查总结。
    四、为了推广五三工厂的经验，必须在中国共产党的领导下统一党、政、工、团的领导思想，必须不断地和以各种形式出现的保守思想进行斗争；同时也必须防止不问具体条件生搬硬套的不切实际的作法。必须克服一切困难，坚决贯彻到底。
    五、关于五三工厂经验介绍的资料、文件，全国总工会将统一印发，并为基层干部编写课本；工人日报、“中国工运”及各地工会组织出版的报刊，应系统地宣传五三工厂基层组织的经验及推广的情况与经验。
    六、各产业、大行政区、省、市工会组织，应制订推广五三工厂工作经验的计划，报告中华全国总工会。
