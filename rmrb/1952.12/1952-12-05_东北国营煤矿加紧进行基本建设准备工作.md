Northeast State-Owned Coal Mines Accelerate Basic Construction Preparations
The state-owned coal mines under the Northeast Coal Mining Bureau are accelerating preparations for basic construction in 1953.

The first task is to prepare directly for the first quarter construction next year—that is, winter construction. In the past, the completion of basic construction plans for various coal mines in Northeast China was very uneven throughout the year. Although there was great progress in 1952, the first quarter only completed 9.2 percent of the annual plan, and the second quarter completed 22.1 percent, leaving 68.7 percent of the tasks to be completed in the third and fourth quarters. In this way, the work in the second half of the year was often forced to take the form of a crash program, affecting the quality of the project; at the same time, the amount of labor used in each quarter varied greatly, resulting in a large waste of manpower, which increased the cost of the project. In view of these lessons, the Northeast Coal Mining Bureau decided to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, requiring all its units to complete 15 to 20 percent of the annual plan in the first quarter next year, and strive to complete the tasks in each quarter of the year in a more balanced manner. In this way, basic construction can obtain a longer construction period, basically overcome the seasonality of construction, make the use of labor in each quarter roughly balanced, further improve equipment utilization, and greatly reduce costs. In order to achieve this goal, the measures they have taken are: to do as much as possible in the first quarter of the year on projects that can be constructed in winter, such as drilling, vertical and inclined shaft projects, open-pit stripping, and some installation work. In the previous quarter, prepare cold protection equipment, deliver materials to designated locations, establish temporary warehouses, dormitories and studios, and prepare temporary power distribution equipment, lighting equipment, work tools, work clothes, etc.

The second preparatory work is to seize the equipment ordering and material storage work. Last year, due to insufficient attention to ordering work, many equipment could only be delivered at the end of this year or in January next year, affecting the progress of construction and installation projects. Accepting this lesson, they began ordering work in October this year. After consultation with relevant units, most of the equipment has been resolved. When carrying out this work, they paid special attention to the equipment ordering of key projects, such as drilling rigs, pipes, and tunneling equipment. At the same time, attention was also paid to the completeness of equipment and materials. Otherwise, if there is a hanging pump but no oil leakage switch, a winch but no steel wire rope, or cement but no sand and gravel, it still cannot be used or construction cannot start.

The third task is to adjust the organization, train workers and cadres. Construction is changed from self-operation to contracting. The work of fixing workers has begun, and it is planned to train 10,000 workers in rotation. In order to improve the leadership level of cadres, the Bureau will concentrate 20 managers of engineering companies to study relevant basic construction policies, guidelines, laws and regulations, as well as advanced experience such as vertical shaft parallel operation, organizing construction according to instruction diagrams, flow-line operation, and leadership issues of summarizing and promoting advanced experience.

    东北国营煤矿加紧进行基本建设准备工作
    东北煤矿管理局所属各国营煤矿，正加紧进行一九五三年基本建设的准备工作。
    第一件是直接为明年第一季施工——即冬季施工作准备。过去，东北各煤矿每年基本建设计划的完成情况，各个季度是很不均衡的。一九五二年虽大有进步，但第一季度仍只完成了全年计划的百分之九点二，第二季完成了百分之二十二点一，有百分之六十八点七的任务需要在第三第四两季中完成。这样，下半年的工作就往往被迫采取突击方式，影响工程质量；同时由于各季中劳动力的使用量相差很大，人力的浪费也就很大，因而便提高了工程成本。鉴于这些教训，东北煤矿管理局决定学习苏联先进经验，要求所属各单位明年第一季完成全年计划的百分之十五到二十，争取全年各季比较均衡地完成任务。这样基本建设就可获得较长的施工期，基本上克服施工的季节性，使各个季度劳动力的使用大体均衡，设备利用率得以进一步发挥，成本也可大大降低。为了达到这一目的，他们所采取的措施是：将钻探、竖井斜井工程、露天剥离、及一些安装工作等可以在冬季施工的工程，尽量在第一季度中多做一些。在前一季度，就准备好防寒设备，将材料送到指定地点，建立临时仓库、宿舍与工作室，准备好临时配电设备、照明设备和工作器具、工作服等。
    第二件准备工作是抓紧了设备订货及材料储备工作。去年由于对订货工作重视不够，很多设备到今年年底或明年一月才能交货，影响了建筑安装工程的进行。接受这一教训，他们从今年十月便开始订货工作，经与有关单位协商，大部设备已得到解决。在进行这项工作时，他们特别抓紧了重点工程的设备订货，如钻机、管材及掘井设备等。同时也注意到了设备及材料的成套性。否则有了吊泵而没有油露开关，有了卷扬机而没有钢丝绳，有了洋灰而没有砂子石子，仍旧不能使用或不能开工。
    第三件是调整机构，整训工人和干部。施工由自营改为包工制。固定工人的工作已经开始，准备轮训一万工人。为提高干部领导水平，管理局将集中二十名工程公司经理学习有关基本建设的政策、方针、法令以及竖井平行作业、按指示图组织施工、流水作业等先进经验和总结与推广先进经验的领导问题。（乔林）
