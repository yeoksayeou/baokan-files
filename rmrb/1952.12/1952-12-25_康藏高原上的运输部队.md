    The Transportation Troops on the Kangzang Plateau
    Liu Fengzhan, Zhou Langsheng
    On the Kangzang Plateau, thousands of meters above sea level, the transportation troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army drive their vehicles day and night on the Kangzang Highway. The drivers face wind, snow, rain, and hail, pass over cliffs and precipices, overcome various difficulties, and have achieved tremendous results, ensuring the supply of troops and opening the gateway to the interior for the Tibetan people. Here, based on what the authors have seen and heard, we recount a few heroic deeds of the transportation troops.
    Conquering Mount Erlang
    Mount Erlang, 3,600 meters above sea level, is the first major mountain on the Kangzang Highway. The roadbed on this mountain is loose, with many sharp turns, steep slopes, and dangerous roads. A slight mismatch between speed and steering wheel angle can lead to the danger of hitting the cliff when making sharp turns; when making small turns, the rear wheels of the vehicle may be suspended in the air, potentially causing it to roll into the deep valley. The unstable "rubber road" is most prone to getting vehicles stuck. To avoid getting stuck, the soldiers fill the road with huge rocks, which makes the vehicle bounce violently. The weather on Mount Erlang is also very harsh, with frequent rain and snow. After 5:00 PM every day, thick fog envelops the entire mountain. Landslides can also block the advance of vehicles at any time. However, the motor vehicle drivers of the transportation troops drove back and forth with composure and resourcefulness.
    On the afternoon of February 25, 1951, the convoy was driving on the frozen road of Mount Erlang. Suddenly, with a swish, vehicle number 47 slid more than a zhang (a Chinese unit of measurement, about 3.3 meters) down a steep slope. Three of the four wheels on the right rear of the vehicle (a ten-wheeled truck) were already suspended in the air, with only one wheel touching the edge of the cliff.碎石细砂 By the roadside, gravel and fine sand kept falling into the gully. If the vehicle slid back half a chi (a Chinese unit of measurement, about 1/3 meter) further, it would roll into the deep valley. Comrades were immediately nervous. But the vehicles in front dared not pull it. The vehicles behind could not push it. Vehicle number 47 was stuck on the steep slope, and the road was blocked. "The task is so urgent, and the advancing troops need food so much. Can we just watch vehicle number 47 being abandoned on Mount Erlang? No! Absolutely not!" Battalion Leader Fan Fangxiang thought, and immediately said to the instructor, "I will be with the vehicle. I must get the vehicle up!" As he spoke, he jumped into the driver's seat of vehicle number 47, held the handbrake tightly with his right hand, gripped the steering wheel with his left hand, gritted his teeth, and powerfully revved the engine. Everyone was very nervous, worried about Fan Fangxiang's life, and moved by his heroic behavior. The engine roared, and everyone's hearts beat with the engine. But, slowly, the wheels began to turn, and the vehicle finally escaped danger. The comrades breathed a sigh of relief and immediately jumped onto the vehicle, warmly embracing this brave people's driver.
    Chen Ruipan on the Dadu River
    After crossing Mount Erlang and reaching Luding, the raging Dadu River lies ahead. The flow rate of the river is seven meters per second. During the Long March of the Red Army, eighteen warriors conquered the Dadu River. Chen Ruipan, a delegate to the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, also conquered the Dadu River with a spirit of fearlessness.
    The time was the morning of December 22, 1950. Heaps of irregular ice floes on the Dadu River squeezed against each other in the rapid current, making a clattering sound. The biting cold wind swept across the surface of the Dadu River from the snowy mountain tops, making people shiver. Chen Ruipan drove a large crane to the edge of the Dadu River. His task was to rescue two ten-wheeled trucks from a certain company that had accidentally overturned from the ferry into the Dadu River while crossing. The slope at the ferry was very steep, and the crane's chassis was not very strong. To avoid accidents during the lifting of the vehicles, he worked intensely for two hours, wearing only a single layer of clothing, in the air more than two zhang (over six meters) above the water, setting up a tripod. But when the ferry workers went into the water to tie the lifting ropes, they failed to tie them properly twice. Although Chen Ruipan was extremely tired at this time, he did not hesitate to ask the Deputy Regiment Commander Tian Zhenhuan for instructions, saying, "I am a people's hero who has seen Chairman Mao, and I am a Communist Party member. To rescue the property of the motherland, I must go into the water!" He took out the only five hundred thousand yuan he had from his pocket and handed it to Zhou Maoyu, the director of the political office, saying, "If I sacrifice myself, this will be my last Party dues!" After saying that, he jumped naked into the icy rapid current. He persisted in the water for four minutes, finally tying the lifting rope firmly. When he finally victoriously boarded the ferry, the comrades standing on the shore immediately rushed onto the ferry, wrapped him tightly in a leather overcoat, and lifted him high onto the ferry.
    Heroes on Mount Que'er
    Mount Que'er is west of Ganzi in Xikang Province, 5,300 meters above sea level, and there are no inhabitants for fifty kilometers up and down. The summit is barren, and it snows almost all year round, except for very short periods.
    One morning in early July this year, heavy rain during the rainy season on the Kangzang Plateau eroded the ice and snow, and the accumulated snow on the mountainside of Mount Que'er began to melt. Yao Changben drove a small GAZ truck loaded with supplies, cautiously moving forward on the dangerous mountain road, reducing his speed. Suddenly, there was a loud crash from the mountain, and huge rocks and sand, along with ice blocks, collapsed straight onto the truck. Both the man and the vehicle were in danger of being buried by the landslide, and at this time, it was too late to reverse the vehicle. Yao Changben had a flash of inspiration and powerfully revved the engine, speeding up and driving quickly past. Although he avoided the landslide behind him, a large rock weighing more than a thousand jin (a Chinese unit of measurement, about 500 grams) happened to roll down from the mountain and blocked the front wheels of the truck. The truck had to stop. Yao Changben jumped out of the truck and tried to move the rock, but one person could not move it at all; there were no ropes to tow it with the vehicle. Small stones and fine sand continued to collapse downwards, and it looked like a large landslide was about to come down. He risked danger and used the hand crank to pry the large stone, but the hand crank bent, and he still couldn't move it. The tire iron was also not strong enough. Later, he found a jack in the toolbox and came up with an idea: dig a hole next to the stone, put a stone underneath, use the jack to lift the giant stone, and then use the leverage of the tire iron to slowly move the stone to the side of the road. Just as he moved it to the middle of the road, small stones from the landslide smashed a hole in his hand, and fresh blood flowed out. But Yao Changben, in order to rescue the vehicle and supplies, still calmly moved the stone. After half an hour of effort, he finally overturned the large stone into the mountain gully. At this time, fresh blood was constantly spurting out with his panting breaths. But he thought that even if he lost more blood, he must first drive the vehicle out of the dangerous area. So he didn't even bandage the wound and hurriedly jumped into the driver's seat, started the engine, and drove forward quickly. The vehicle had just driven about thirty meters when a large chunk of the landslide collapsed behind it. At this time, Yao Changben stopped the truck and bandaged the wound with the emergency kit.

    康藏高原上的运输部队
    刘凤展  周浪声
    在拔海数千公尺以上的康藏高原上，中国人民解放军的运输部队，日日夜夜驾驶着汽车，行驶在康藏公路上。驾驶员们迎着风雪雨雹，驶过悬崖峭壁，克服了种种困难，创造了巨大成绩，保证了部队的供应，为藏族人民打开了通向内地的门户。这里仅就作者所见所闻，追述几段运输部队的英雄事迹。
    战胜二郎山
    二郎山拔海三千六百公尺，是康藏公路上的第一座大山。这座山上的公路路基松，急弯多，坡陡，路险。车速和方向盘的角度稍有不合，转大弯时就有碰崖的危险；转小弯时，车的后轮就会悬空，可能翻下深谷。不坚实的“橡皮路”，最易陷车。为了避免陷车，战士们用巨石填路，因此车子行驶起来蹦跳得异常厉害。二郎山的天气也很恶劣，时常下雨、下雪。每天下午五点钟以后，大雾又笼罩了全山。坍方更会随时阻挡车辆的前进。但运输部队的汽车驾驶员们沉着机智地驶来驶去。
    一九五一年二月二十五日的下午，车队正在二郎山冰冻的公路上驶进。突然涮啦一声，四十七号车从一个陡坡上滑下来一丈多远。车子（十轮卡车）右后边的四个轮子已经悬空了三个，只剩一个车轮擦住了崖边。路旁的碎石细砂不断地往沟里掉。车子如果再滑退半尺，就会整个翻下深谷。同志们顿时紧张起来。但前边的车也不敢拖。后边也不能用车顶。四十七号车卡在陡坡上，路被拥塞着。“任务是那样紧迫，进军部队是那样需要粮食，难道眼看四十七号车丢在二郎山不成？不能！绝对不能！”七班长范芳祥这样想着，立即对指导员说：“人在车在，我一定要把车子弄上来！”说着他就跳上四十七号车的驾驶台，右手紧拉着手刹车，左手握住方向盘，咬紧牙关，猛力地轰着油门。这时大家很紧张，都为范芳祥的生命担着心，为他的英勇行为而感动。发动机发出隆隆的怒吼声，大家的心随着马达声在跳动。但是，慢慢地，车轮开始转动起来了，车辆终于脱险了。同志们松了口气，立即蹦上车去，热烈拥抱这位英勇的人民驾驶员。
    大渡河上的陈瑞盘
    翻过二郎山，到达泸定，前面就是惊涛骇浪的大渡河。河水每秒钟的流速达七公尺。红军长征时，十八勇士战胜了大渡河。出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表陈瑞盘，同样以无畏的精神战胜了大渡河。
    时间是一九五零年十二月二十二日早上。大渡河上成堆而没有规律的冰块群，在急流中挤得哗啦作响。刺骨的寒风从雪山顶上一直掠过大渡河的水面，吹得人们都在打战。陈瑞盘开着大吊车来到大渡河边，他的任务是抢救某连在渡河时不慎从渡船上翻进了大渡河的两部十轮卡车。渡口的坡度很陡，大吊车的车架不很坚固。为了避免在起吊车辆时发生意外，他穿着单衣在二丈多高的空中紧张地工作了两小时，搭起了一个三脚架。但渡船的工友们下水捆吊绳时，两次都没有捆好。陈瑞盘此时虽然疲累已极，却又毫不犹豫地向副团长田震环请示说：“我是见过毛主席的人民功臣，又是共产党员，为了抢救祖国的财产，我要下水去！”他从口袋里拿出仅有的五万元交给政治处主任周茂玉，说：“如果我牺牲了，这就作为我最后的党费！”说罢就赤身跳入冰冷的急流中。他在水中坚持了有四分钟之久，终于把吊绳捆绑结实。当他最后胜利地登上渡船时，站在岸上的同志们立即拥上渡船，用皮大衣把他紧紧裹起，高高地举着登上了渡口。
    雀儿山上的英雄
    雀儿山在西康省甘孜之西，拔海五千三百公尺，上下五十公里没有人烟，山顶草木不生，整年除了很少的时间以外，差不多都是飘着雪花的。
    今年七月初的一天早上，康藏高原雨季的急雨冲蚀着冰雪，雀儿山山腰里的积雪开始融化。姚长本驾驶着一辆满载物资的小嘎斯车，在山腰的险道上，减低速度谨慎地前进。忽然山上哗啦一声巨响，巨石流砂伴随着冰块直向车上坍下来。人、车都处在将被坍方埋葬的危险里，而这时车辆后退已来不及。姚长本急中生智，猛轰油门，加快行速，疾驶了过去。后边的坍方虽然避过了，但一块一千多斤重的大石头，刚巧从山上翻下来，顶住了车子的前轮。车子不得不停了下来。姚长本跳下车，试了试，一个人根本搬不动那块石头；用车子拖又没有绳索。小石细砂还在继续往下坍，眼看大的坍方就要下来了。他冒着危险，用摇手柄撬大石，摇手柄撬歪了，也没能移动它。撬胎棒又使不上劲。后来他在工具箱里发现了千斤顶，才想出了窍门：把石头旁边挖一个洞，下边垫上石头，用千斤顶把巨石顶起来，然后利用撬胎棒的杠杆作用，慢慢地把这块石头往路旁移。刚移到公路中间，坍方的小石块又把他的手砸了一个窟窿，鲜血直流。但是姚长本为了抢救车辆和物资，仍然沉着地移动着石头。经过半个钟头的努力，才把大石翻下山沟。这时，鲜血随着他气喘的呼吸不断地向外喷射。但他想，即便自己多流些血，也必须先把车辆开出危险地带。所以他连伤口也没有包扎，就急忙跳上驾驶室，开动马达，急驶前进。车子刚驶出三十公尺左右，后面的坍方就垮下来很大一块。这时姚长本才停下车来，用救急包裹扎伤口。
