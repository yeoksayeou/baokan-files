Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The heinous crime of the American aggressors in inhumanely massacring a large number of captured personnel from our side in the Pongam Island POW camp has aroused serious protests from Soviet newspapers and progressive public opinion in the United States, Britain, and France.

The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published an editorial entitled "The Bloody Crimes of the American Aggressors," stating: In the two and a half years of the Korean War, the Korean people and the glorious fighters of their Chinese brothers who aided them have thoroughly shattered the American conspiracy to seize and enslave Korea. The American bandit army and its mercenary troops have paid a heavy price in the war of aggression against the Korean people. According to the figures released by the Korean-Chinese Command, as of October 15, 1952, the total number of imperialist aggressors killed and wounded exceeded 660,000, of which 300,000 were American troops.

"Izvestia" continued: But there is another figure that can explain why the American ruling clique continues to engage in their evil gamble, despite suffering unprecedented defeats in American military history. This is the figure of the profits earned by American arms monopoly capitalists. In the first year of the Korean War, American monopoly capitalists earned 23 billion US dollars. In the subsequent year and a half, they earned even greater profits. American monopoly capitalists are very afraid of peace because they have seen the specter of economic crisis constantly approaching the United States. There is no anti-human crime that the American aggressors have not committed in Korea. They have embarked on the road of fascist plunder and Hitlerite tyranny and are continuing down this shameful road. In recent days, the world has learned about the massacre of prisoners of war on Pongam Island. The bloody events on Pongam Island will become an indelible piece of evidence of the crimes committed by the inhuman American aggressors in the history of the Korean War. These events will also prove in history that the aggressors are completely powerless in the face of the staunch and indomitable heroism of Korean patriots. The events on Pongam Island have even alarmed the bourgeois newspapers of many accomplice countries in the American war of aggression against Korea. Those who pretended to be "humanitarians" and "protectors" of prisoners of war at the Seventh UN General Assembly now appear to be such a gang of people! Is it not now perfectly clear to people all over the world that the purpose of the UN resolutions on the Korean issue was merely to instigate the American aggressors to commit new atrocities and to continue to plunder Korea for the benefit of the Wall Street bosses?

The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article on the 20th, co-authored by Makarenko and Dukinsky, who emphasized that world public opinion is denouncing the butchers for killing unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The authors said: The massacre on Pongam Island is only one link in a series of heinous crimes committed by the US military in Korea. The real intention of the American devils is to eliminate all Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who are unwilling to betray their motherland and join the mercenary forces of the Li Chengwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. The authors emphasized that the bloody tragedy on Pongam Island is a direct consequence of the shameful and illegal resolutions made by the United Nations on the Korean issue. The gentlemen of the so-called UN majority who voted in favor of this resolution should also know that their hands are stained with the blood of innocent victims. Nothing can wash away this blood! All honest people who know about these unprecedented crimes committed by the United States in Korea cannot and will never remain silent. The voice of the people's anger has resounded throughout China and Poland, India and Japan, Indonesia and Canada. Stop the war of plunder in Korea, and severely punish the American war criminals in accordance with the principles of international law and human conscience—this is the unanimous demand of the people of all countries.

The Soviet newspaper "Literaturnaya Gazeta" published a paper by Snegov on the 18th, who wrote: The American murderers will not stop, they are planning more and more evil deeds, they are enlisting new allies, and they are trying to drag more vassal states into their aggressive gamble. However, all these fanatical actions only prove that the policy of aggression has been met with resolute resistance from the people and is collapsing.

The American "Daily Worker" published an article on the front page on the 16th, saying: "The massacre on Pongam Island tells the American people that the generals and politicians in Washington are determined to continue the Korean War." The article emphasized: Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's call for an immediate ceasefire in Korea opened the door to peace. The continuation of the war by the United States in Korea can only cause new and greater casualties to the American army.

The British "Daily Worker" editorial on the 16th said: "This latest incident is the most despicable in a series of massacres in Korean prisoner-of-war camps." The editorial said: The hope of ending the war and returning British soldiers home, which is widely reflected in the labor movement, can be realized by the people's unanimous demand for an immediate ceasefire and unconditional repatriation of prisoners of war.

The French newspaper "L'Humanité" commented on the 16th, when reporting on the American massacre of prisoners of war on Pongam Island: "These atrocities once again tore down the shameful mask of the United States, the so-called unwillingness to repatriate prisoners of war is to 'protect' them."

The French newspaper "Ce Soir" also published a commentary on the 16th, exposing the evil motives of the US side in massacring prisoners of war, saying: "The US military command wants to use weapons to break the prisoners of war's firm will to go home and not be used by Washington, trying to make people believe that thousands of prisoners of war are unwilling to go home."

[Xinhua News Agency, 20th] TASS London, 19th: "Daily Worker" news: The National Committee of the British Veterans' Movement for Peace passed a resolution expressing shock at the killing of prisoners of war in the Pongam Island POW camp.

The resolution called on the British government to urge the US government to strictly abide by international conventions on the issue of prisoners of war.

### 苏联各报和美、英、法等国进步报纸  痛斥美国在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘暴行

    苏联各报和美、英、法等国进步报纸
    痛斥美国在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘暴行
    据新华社讯：美国侵略者惨无人道地大批屠杀蜂岩岛战俘营内我方被俘人员的滔天罪行，引起了苏联各报和美、英、法各国进步舆论的严重抗议。
    苏联“消息报”以“美国侵略者的血腥罪行”为题发表社论说：在两年半的朝鲜战争中，朝鲜人民以及援助他们的中国弟兄的光荣战士们，已经彻底粉碎了美国夺取和奴役朝鲜的阴谋。美国强盗军及其雇佣军队，在进攻朝鲜人民的战争中已经付出重大的代价。根据朝中司令部发表的数字，到一九五二年十月十五日为止，帝国主义侵略军被击毙和击伤的总人数在六十六万以上，其中有三十万是美国军队。
    “消息报”接着说：但是还有另外一个数字，这个数字可以说明为什么美国统治集团尽管遭受了美国军事史上空前未有的失败，还是一味继续进行他们的罪恶赌博。这就是美国军火垄断资本家们所赚的利润的数字。在朝鲜战争的第一年中，美国的垄断资本家们赚了二百三十亿美元。在以后的一年半中，他们赚了更大的利润。美国的垄断资本家们非常害怕和平，因为他们已经看到经济危机的魔影正在不断向美国逼近。没有一种反人类的罪行美国侵略军没有在朝鲜干过。他们已走上法西斯劫掠和希特勒暴政的道路，而且还在继续走这条可耻的道路。近几天来，全世界都已知道了蜂岩岛上屠杀战俘的事件。蜂岩岛上的血腥事件，将要在朝鲜战争史上成为毫无人性的美国侵略者所犯罪行的不可磨灭的证据。这些事件也会在历史上证明：在朝鲜爱国志士坚强不屈的英勇气概的面前，侵略者完全无能为力。蜂岩岛上的事件，甚至使美国侵朝战争的许多帮凶国家的资产阶级报纸都惊惶失措。那些在第七届联合国大会上想假装作“人道主义者”和战俘“保护者”的人们，现在看来竟是这样一班家伙！原来联合国所通过的关于朝鲜问题的提案，目的不过是要怂恿美国侵略者去干新的暴行，去为华尔街老板的利益而继续劫掠朝鲜，现在全世界的人不是已经看得明明白白了吗？
    苏联“真理报”二十日登载了马卡连科和杜金斯基共同执笔的一篇文章，他们强调世界舆论都在申斥屠夫们杀害手无寸铁的朝中战俘。作者说：蜂岩岛的屠杀只是美军在朝鲜所干出的一连串凶恶罪行的一环。美国魔鬼的真正意图是要消灭所有不愿背叛祖国去参加李承晚和蒋介石匪帮雇佣军的朝中战俘。作者强调说：蜂岩岛的血腥悲剧是联合国对于朝鲜问题所作出的可耻的非法的决议的直接后果。投票拥护这个决议的所谓联合国多数的先生们也该知道他们的手上是沾染了无辜牺牲者的鲜血的。任何东西都洗不去这种血迹！凡是知道美国在朝鲜所干的这些空前罪行的一切正直的人们，都不能并且也决不默不作声。人民的愤怒的声音已经响遍了中国和波兰、印度和日本、印尼和加拿大。停止在朝鲜的掠夺战，按照国际法原则和人类良心严惩美国战争罪犯——这就是世界各国人民的一致要求。
    苏联“文学报”十八日发表了斯涅格夫的论文，他写道：美国谋杀者是不会罢休的，他们正在计划着更多、更多的罪恶行为，他们正在拉拢新的盟国，并且企图把更多附属国拉入他们的侵略赌博中去。但是，所有这些狂热的行为，仅仅证明了侵略政策已遭到了人民坚决的反抗，并且正在崩溃中。
    美国“工人日报”十六日在首页刊载文章说：“蜂岩岛的屠杀告诉美国人民，将军们和华盛顿政客们决心要继续朝鲜战争”。文章强调指出：中国外交部长周恩来呼吁在朝鲜立即停火，打开了和平的大门。而美国在朝鲜继续战争只能使美国军队遭到新的和更重大的伤亡。
    英国“工人日报”十六日的社论说：“最近这次事件是朝鲜战俘营内一连串的屠杀事件中的最卑鄙的一次”。社论说：在工人运动中普遍地反映着希望结束战争和使英国士兵回国这个希望可以由人民一致要求立即停火和无条件遣返战俘而实现。
    法国“人道报”在十六日报道美国在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘的暴行时评论说：“这些暴行又一次拆穿了美国可耻的假面具，即所谓不遣返战俘是为了‘保护’他们。”
    法国“今晚报”也在十六日发表评论，揭露美方屠杀战俘的罪恶动机说：“美军司令部想用武器来打破战俘们坚决要求回家而不愿受华盛顿利用的意志，企图使人们相信有成千成万的战俘不愿回家。”
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社伦敦十九日讯：“工人日报”讯：英国退伍军人保卫和平运动协会全国委员会通过一项决议，对蜂岩岛战俘营杀害战俘一事表示震惊。
    决议呼吁英国政府督促美国政府严守关于战俘问题的国际公约。
