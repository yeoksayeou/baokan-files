East China and Central South Actively Prepare to Welcome Large-Scale Basic Construction Next Year

[By our staff reporter] East China's basic construction departments are actively preparing for basic construction in 1953 to welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction.

East China held a basic construction planning work conference in mid-October this year. After the meeting, Party committees and enterprise departments at all levels gradually clearly recognized the important significance of basic construction. Under the leadership of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the East China Military and Political Committee, the East China Financial and Economic Committee, the East China Industry Department, the East China Construction Engineering Department, the East China Transportation Department, the Shanghai Municipal Construction Committee, the East China Culture and Education Committee, and the Bank of Communications (basic construction fund disbursement agency) and other units, respectively sent responsible cadres for basic construction to form the East China Basic Construction Office, which regularly works collectively to uniformly, plannedly, and step-by-step quickly solve major problems related to the preparatory work for basic construction. Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, regularly listens to the office's reports and provides guidance on basic construction work.

In order to solve the contradiction of "the task of basic construction is very important, while the strength of basic construction is very weak," and to learn from the lessons of the imbalance between construction capacity and basic construction tasks this year, East China's basic construction departments are currently carrying out the following tasks: (1) Rapidly expand the strength of construction engineering. The East China Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building, the East China Textile Administration, and other enterprise departments are actively transferring cadres to enrich and establish basic construction organizations. The East China Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building held a meeting of Party committee secretaries and factory directors of subordinate factories from December 6th to 8th to discuss the plans of each factory's production department to transfer and train cadres and technicians. The East China Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to transfer 204 technicians from various factories before the end of this year, and to transfer 396 administrative cadres in batches to basic construction departments before the end of March next year. It also plans to train 403 management cadres and 631 technicians for basic construction departments next year. In order to summarize and exchange the experience of this year's construction work and to deploy next year's production tasks, East China plans to hold the first regional construction work conference within the year. While organizing and expanding the strength of construction engineering, East China's basic construction departments focus on supporting the key construction areas of the country with excellent design and construction forces to complete the country's entire basic construction tasks. (2) Strengthen the planning and organization of basic construction work. East China's provincial and municipal basic construction plans for next year will be re-verified and unnecessary parts will be reduced. Each basic construction department and construction engineering department will strive to sign preliminary construction entrustment contracts by the end of the year to strengthen the responsibilities of both parties. On this basis, projects that span this year and the first quarter of next year will be classified and prioritized according to their importance and urgency, and construction will be carried out in order. (3) The storage and supply of building materials is one of the main items in the preparatory work, and it is also an important key to whether construction can proceed smoothly next year. In addition to hardware and wood, the quantity of bricks and tiles needed in Shanghai next year is enormous. The existing bricks and tiles are only enough for use within the year, and the first quarter of next year is the winter freezing period, according to the convention, it is impossible to manufacture green bricks. If this difficulty is not resolved, the construction project next year will be in danger of stagnation. To this end, East China's basic construction departments have mobilized the local farmers in Xiaoshan, Jiashan and other counties, the main brick and tile producing areas, through the Party and government organizations to continue to produce green bricks without freezing them in winter; the appropriate increase in funding required has been appropriately resolved to prevent the occurrence of inferior quality.

Xinhua News Agency reported: The Central South region is actively preparing for large-scale basic construction next year. In order to strengthen the leadership of basic construction, the Industry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee has assigned a group of veteran cadres transferred from the CPC Party organizations and government agencies to basic construction departments. Among the 172 veteran cadres above the county level who were transferred to the industrial sector, 91 were assigned to basic construction departments to take on leadership positions. The transfer of cadres from production departments to strengthen the work of basic construction departments has also begun. Fifty-six technicians have been transferred from various production posts to basic construction departments. The Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill transferred more than 20 cadres and technicians at one time. With a large number of cadres transferred to basic construction departments, many basic construction organizations have been established or improved. The basic construction organizations of the textile, fuel and other systems under the Industry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee have been increasingly strengthened. Many major state-owned factories and mines that did not have independent basic construction departments have now begun to establish them. The basic construction strength of the entire Central South region has been initially unified and adjusted. The Construction Engineering Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee has begun to merge and unify the construction strength of the entire region. The First Construction Engineering Company and the Second Construction Engineering Company of the Central South Construction Engineering Department, which were established after the merger, have a large force. The number of construction technicians alone accounts for one-third of the total number of construction technicians in the entire region, becoming the main force for basic construction in the entire region in the future. Regarding the basic construction plan of the Central South region for 1953, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee has sent a working group to help the provinces prepare it in a tense manner. It is expected that all plans can be completed before December 20.

    华东中南积极进行准备工作
    迎接明年大规模基本建设
    【本报讯】华东各基本建设部门，为着迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设，正在积极进行一九五三年度基本建设的准备工作。
    华东区在今年十月中旬举行了基本建设计划工作会议。会后，各级党委与企业部门逐渐明确地认识到基本建设的重要意义。在中共中央华东局和华东军政委员会的领导下，华东财政经济委员会、华东工业部、华东建筑工程部、华东交通部、上海市政建设委员会、华东文化教育委员会和交通银行（基本建设经费支拨机关）等单位，分别派基本建设的负责干部，组成了华东基本建设办公室，定期集体办公，统一地、有计划、有步骤地迅速解决有关各基本建设准备工作中的重大问题。中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林经常听取办公室的报告，并对基本建设工作给以指导。
    为了解决“基本建设任务十分重大，而基本建设力量则十分薄弱”的矛盾，并接受今年建筑能力与基本建设任务不能平衡的经验教训，华东各基本建设部门目前正进行下列工作：（一）迅速壮大建筑工程力量。中央第一机械工业部华东办事处、华东纺织管理局等各企业部门已在积极抽调干部充实和建立基本建设机构。中央第一机械工业部华东办事处，已于十二月六日至八日召开所属工厂党委书记和厂长会议，讨论各厂生产部门抽调和培养干部、技术人员的计划。中央第一机械工业部华东办事处已决定在今年年底以前从各厂抽调技术人员二百零四人，明年三月底以前分批抽调行政干部三百九十六人到基本建设部门去，并计划于明年内为基本建设部门培养管理干部四百零三人，技术人员六百三十一人。为了总结和交流今年建筑工作的经验及布置明年的生产任务，华东准备在年内召开全区第一次建筑工作会议。在组织与扩大建筑工程力量的同时，华东各基本建设部门着重把优秀的设计和施工力量支援全国重点建设地区，以完成国家整个基本建设任务。（二）加强基本建设工作的计划性和组织性。华东各省市明年的基本建设计划将再经过一次核实工作，并削减不必要的部分。各基本建设部门与建筑工程部门争取做到在年底订好初步的建筑委托合同，以加强双方责任。在这一基础上将今年跨年度的与明年第一季度的工程按轻重缓急分类排队，顺序施工。（三）建筑材料的储备和供应是准备工作中的主要项目之一，也是明年能否顺利施工的重要关键。建筑材料除五金、木材之外，上海明年需要的砖瓦数量是十分巨大的。现有砖瓦，只够年内之用，而明年第一季正值冬季冰冻时期，按惯例是无法制造坯砖的，这一困难不解决，明年建筑工程就有陷于停顿的危险。为此，华东各基本建设部门已通过砖瓦主要产地萧山、嘉善等县党、政机构，动员当地制造坯砖的农民在冬季不使坯砖结冰，继续生产；需要适当增加的经费，已给以适当解决，以防止质量低劣的现象发生。
    据新华社讯：中南区积极进行明年大规模基本建设的准备工作。中南军政委员会工业部为了加强对基本建设的领导，已把一批由中共党组织和政府机关输送出来的老干部分配到基本建设部门中去。在调入工业部门的一百七十二个县级以上的老干部中，就有九十一个被分配到基本建设部门担任领导工作。从生产部门抽调干部加强基本建设部门的工作也已开始进行。从各个生产岗位上调到基本建设部门的技术人员已有五十六人，武汉第一纱厂一次调出的干部和技术人员就有二十多人。由于大批干部抽调到基本建设部门中来，许多基本建设机构已经建立或健全起来。中南军政委员会工业部所属纺织、燃料等系统的基本建设机构已日益加强，许多主要国营厂矿原来没有独立的基本建设部门的，现在也已开始建立起来。中南区全区的基本建设力量已作了初步的统一调整。中南军政委员会建筑工程部已把全区建筑力量开始合并统一起来。合并后成立的中南建筑工程部第一工程公司和第二工程公司力量庞大，仅施工技术人员就占全区施工技术人员总数的三分之一，成为今后全区基本建设的主要力量。关于中南区一九五三年的基本建设计划，中南军政委员会财政经济委员会已派出工作组，帮助各省紧张地进行编制。预计在十二月二十日以前全部计划可以编好。
