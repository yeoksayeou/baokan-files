Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Beijing's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities have concluded successfully. During this month-long, massive mass activity, more than two million people in Beijing received at least one education, thereby laying a good foundation for the regular activities of Sino-Soviet friendship in Beijing.
	The Beijing "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities gradually entered a climax after the arrival of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, the Soviet Art Troupe, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Soviet Film Artists Delegation in Beijing in early November. The people of Beijing described the precious moments of meeting Soviet friends and watching their outstanding performances as "the most unforgettable day." Workers from the Datai Coal Mine in the Jingxi Mining Area specifically traveled more than 30 miles of mountain roads to see the performances of Soviet friends; Li Jinquan, a national labor model from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, was deeply encouraged by the Soviet friends' artistic performances and expressed his willingness to repay the friendship of the Soviet people with greater achievements in production. After the get-together with the distinguished guests, the peasant Zong Lantian said emotionally: "I knew two years ago that the Soviet Union was our friend, but I didn't feel how close we were. This time, seeing the Soviet artists is like seeing my own brothers, as if Stalin himself had come!" After the get-together with the distinguished guests, the workers of the Beijing People's Printing Factory immediately turned their enthusiasm for loving and learning from the Soviet Union into production, and all workshops launched a production competition under the slogan of "Learning from Soviet Advanced Experience, Overcoming Difficulties, and Completing the Fourth Quarter's Tasks Ahead of Schedule." During their activities in Beijing, Soviet friends met directly with 200,000 people in Beijing, leaving an eternal memory in the hearts of the people of Beijing.
	During the climax of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, schools, urban streets, and rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing widely carried out publicity and education activities related to Sino-Soviet friendship. Cadres from municipal-level government agencies and organizations and cadres from agencies directly under the Central People's Government participated in this large-scale publicity work. In this publicity and education movement, more than two million people in the city generally received at least one education. Many organized workers, students, and government cadres underwent more than three studies. The Soviet Film Exhibition, the mobile screenings of Soviet films, and the large and small Soviet photo exhibitions were also widely carried out with the development of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement. From November 7th to December 1st, 800,000 viewers went to various cinemas to see the Soviet film exhibition, more than 550,000 viewers watched the mobile screenings of Soviet films, and more than 1.5 million viewers watched the photos introducing the happy life of the Soviet people.
	The various activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" have enabled the people of Beijing to further understand the Soviet Union and further recognize the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship for safeguarding world peace and the free and happy lives of our people. Loving the Soviet Union, learning from the Soviet people, and "taking the path of the Russians" have become the direction of the efforts of people from all walks of life in Beijing. The workers in various factories, mines, and enterprises are enthusiastically learning from the Soviet Union's advanced production experience. The Shijingshan Power Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Changxindian Railway Factory, the Beijing Clothing Factory, the Beijing Machine Factory, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, the Beijing Public Transport Company, and other factories and enterprises launched production competitions to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and achieved great results. A certain blast furnace in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant created three new records in a row from November 6th to 14th, with output exceeding the original quota of the blast furnace by 33%, and the utilization coefficient of effective volume has been reduced to 0.72; The workers of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau have improved their work efficiency by 2.5 times because they learned the advanced Soviet experience of pulling and erecting poles; The employees of state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the city gloriously completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy in 1952 ahead of schedule within this month. Among young students, loving the Soviet Union and learning the noble qualities of Soviet heroes have become a trend. In nine schools, including the Huimin College, Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School, and Boys' Middle School, there are classes named after Soviet heroes such as Zoya, Oleg, and Matrosov. Young students are using the deeds of Soviet heroes as their role models. When studying high jump, female student Zhao Shuying could not do the straddle roll, but when she heard the teacher say "Students in the Zoya class should not be afraid of difficulties," she mustered up the courage and quickly learned it. Some young members of the English Department of Peking University originally had a bad relationship, but when they thought of Matrosov's spirit of class friendship, they all sincerely reviewed their shortcomings and restored their friendship. Young people's love for the Soviet Union is reflected in their unprecedented enthusiasm for learning Russian. Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and the Aviation Academy successfully tested a crash course method for learning Russian in seven professional books such as physics, biology, and mathematics during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." After the peasants in the suburbs understood that "the Soviet Union today is our tomorrow," organizing to develop production has become the requirement of the vast number of peasants in the suburbs. The following words are now prevalent among the peasants in the suburbs: "We must work hard to learn culture in order to master machines and live a happy life like the Soviet people." Many people who did not attend winter school in previous years have signed up for school this year. Educators, cultural and artistic workers, ethnic minorities living in Beijing, and the vast urban masses in Beijing have also been swept into this great upsurge of loving and learning from the Soviet Union.
	During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the organization of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was greatly expanded. According to preliminary statistics, the membership of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has increased from 550,000 to 750,000, making the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association now the mass organization with the largest number of people and the widest scope in the city.
	Now the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is summarizing the experience of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in order to regularize the Sino-Soviet friendship activities in Beijing.

    北京“中苏友好月”胜利结束
    全市人民普遍受到中苏友好的实际教育
    【新华社六日讯】北京市“中苏友好月”活动已胜利结束。在这个为期一个月巨大的群众性的活动中，北京二百多万人民都普遍受到了一次以上的教育，从而为北京市中苏友好的经常活动打下了良好的基础。
    北京“中苏友好月”活动，自十一月初苏联文化工作者代表团、苏联艺术工作团、苏军红旗歌舞团和苏联电影艺术工作者代表团到达北京后，即逐渐进入高潮。北京的人们都以“最难忘的一天”来形容和苏联友人见面和观看他们杰出的表演的那些可贵的时刻。京西矿区大台煤矿的工人特地走了三十多里山路，来看苏联友人的表演；全国劳动模范石景山钢铁厂的工人李金泉，深为苏联友人的艺术表演所鼓舞，表示愿以生产上的更大成就来报答苏联人民的友情。农民宗兰田在和贵宾们联欢后感动的说：“头二年就知道苏联是咱们的朋友，可是我感觉不到怎样亲热，这一回一见苏联艺术家，就像见了亲兄弟一样，好像斯大林亲自来了！”北京人民印刷厂工人在和贵宾们联欢后，立刻把热爱苏联向苏联学习的热情转到生产上去，各车间都在“学习苏联先进经验，克服困难，提前完成第四季任务”的口号下，展开了生产竞赛。苏联友人在北京活动期间，曾和北京二十万人直接见面，在北京人民心中留下了永恒的记忆。
    在“中苏友好月”高潮期间，北京市各工厂、矿山、企业、机关、学校以及城区街道和郊区农村，都广泛地开展有关中苏友好的宣传教育活动。市级各机关、团体的干部和中央人民政府直属机关的干部都参加了这一大规模的宣传工作。在这一宣传教育运动中，全市二百多万人都普遍受到了一次以上的教育。有组织的工人、学生以及机关干部，许多都进行了三次以上的学习。苏联电影展览、苏联电影的巡回放映和大、小型的苏联图片展览会，也随着“中苏友好月”的运动展开而广泛的进行着。从十一月七日到十二月一日止，到各电影院去看苏联电影展览的观众八十万人，看巡回放映苏联电影的观众五十五万多人，看介绍苏联人民幸福生活图片的观众在一百五十万人以上。
    “中苏友好月”的各项活动，使北京人民更进一步理解苏联，更进一步认识到中苏友好对于保卫世界和平与我国人民自由幸福生活的重大意义。热爱苏联、向苏联人民学习，“走俄国人的路”，已经成为北京各阶层人民的努力方向。各工厂、矿山、企业的工人们，都在热情地学习着苏联的先进生产经验。石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、长辛店铁路工厂、北京被服厂、北京机器厂、北京电业局、北京市公共汽车公司等工厂企业，并展开了学习苏联先进经验的生产竞赛，获得很大成绩。石景山钢铁厂某高炉在十一月六日到十四日连创三次新纪录，产量超过该高炉原有定额的百分之三十三，有效容积利用系数已降低到零点七二；北京电业局的工人，因为学习了苏联拔杆、立杆的先进经验，工作效率提高二倍半；全市国营和地方国营的工矿、企业的职工们，并在这一个月内，光荣地提前完成了一九五二年增产节约的任务。青年学生间热爱苏联和学习苏联英雄高尚品质，已形成了风气。在回民学院、北京市第一女子中学和男子中学等九个学校里，都有以卓娅、奥列格、马特洛索夫等苏联英雄为名的班级。年轻的学生们都以苏联英雄们的事迹来做自己的榜样。女学生赵书英在学习跳高时，不会侧滚式，但当她听到老师说“卓娅班的学生应当不怕困难”时，即鼓起勇气迅速学会了。北京大学英语系的某些青年团员们原来关系不好，但当他们想到马特洛索夫的阶级友爱精神时，他们都诚恳地检讨了自己的缺点，重新恢复起友谊。青年们热爱苏联，表现在他们学习俄文的热情空前高涨。北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学、北京农业大学、北京工业学院和航空学院的学生们，在“中苏友好月”里在物理、生物、数学等七种专业书籍上，试验成功了学习俄文的速成方法。郊区的农民们了解了“苏联今天就是我们明天”后，组织起来发展生产已成为郊区广大农民的要求。在郊区农民间现在普遍流行着这样的话：“要努力学习文化，才能掌握机器，才能过苏联人民那样的幸福生活。”许多往年不上冬学的人，今年都报名入学了。北京市的教育工作者、文化艺术工作者、以及居住在北京的少数民族和广大的市民群众也都卷入了热爱苏联，学习苏联这一巨大的热潮中。
    在“中苏友好月”里，北京市中苏友好协会的组织大大扩大了。仅据初步统计，中苏友好协会的会员已由五十五万人增加到七十五万人，致使北京市中苏友好协会，现在变成为全市人数最多、范围最广的群众组织。
    现在北京市中苏友好协会正在总结“中苏友好月”活动经验，以便使北京市中苏友好的活动走上经常化。
