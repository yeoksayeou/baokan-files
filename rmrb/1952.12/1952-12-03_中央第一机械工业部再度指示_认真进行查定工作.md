The Central First Ministry of Machine Building Issues Another Directive
Seriously Conduct Capacity Assessment Work

    Most machinery factories across the country have rapidly launched production capacity assessment work following the directive issued by the Central People's Government's First Ministry of Machine Building on September 9th. Some have already completed the assessment. However, the development of assessment work in various regions is uneven. For example, the East China Industrial Department has organized a large number of cadres to go down to the factories to promote the work, with thorough mobilization, and has done a better job. Some regions have done a poorer job. Some leading cadres in certain units do not fully understand the spirit and significance of the assessment work, worrying that "after the higher authorities find out the bottom line, they will allocate more tasks." Some believe that "after potential capacity is discovered, the higher authorities will no longer approve capital construction." Others believe that "the factory's capacity has already been exploited to the maximum, so it doesn't matter whether it is assessed or not." Some responsible cadres in factories believe that the factory has too many central tasks and cannot spare the effort to conduct production capacity assessment.

    In order to overcome these shortcomings and dispel the ideological concerns currently existing among leading cadres in some units, the Central People's Government's First Ministry of Machine Building issued another directive on November 22nd, explaining the important significance of assessment work. The directive pointed out that assessment work is proposed to eliminate blindness in machinery industry production and capital construction work, and it is a fundamental link in the current stage of machinery industry development. The proposal, review, and approval of plans, and the deployment of central tasks will all be based on the results of production capacity assessment. The directive stipulates that units that have not realistically determined quotas, have not effectively tapped potential capacity, and have not proposed concrete solutions and implementation plans for weaknesses should quickly make new arrangements, or even reassess. Units with chaotic systems and a poor foundation for quota work should improve their systems and reorganize quotas according to the requirements of production capacity assessment, in order to remove obstacles for the 1953 assessment work.

    For units that have completed the assessment, the directive requires them to pay attention to consolidating the achievements already made and further improve the summary of the assessment work. Based on the assessment work, they should prepare a technical improvement measures plan for 1953. The central content of this plan should be to exploit potential capacity and improve product quality. The directive emphasized that improving quality will be an important task in 1953. All machinery factories across the country must list this task as one of the main tasks in 1953 and resolutely strive to improve quality and improve the technical level of the machinery industry from all aspects!

### 中央第一机械工业部再度指示  认真进行查定工作

    中央第一机械工业部再度指示
    认真进行查定工作
    全国大多数机械工厂执行中央人民政府第一机械工业部九月九日发出的指示，已迅速展开了生产能力查定工作，有的已查定完毕。但是各地区查定工作的发展是不平衡的，如华东工业部组织大批干部下厂推动工作，动员彻底，做得较好。而有些地区就做得较差。有些单位的领导干部对查定工作的精神和意义领会得不够，顾虑“上级摸到底之后，会多分配任务”，有的以为“发现潜在能力之后，上级不再准许基本建设了”，还有些认为“本厂能力已发挥得差不多，算不算都一样”。有些工厂的负责干部认为工厂的中心任务太多，无力再搞生产能力查定。
    为了克服这些缺点，解除目前部分单位的领导干部中存在的思想顾虑，中央人民政府第一机械工业部在十一月二十二日再次发出指示，说明查定工作的重要意义。指示指出：查定工作是针对消灭机械工业生产和基本建设工作中的盲目性而提出的，它是现阶段机械工业发展的基本环节。计划的提出、审核和批准，中心工作的布置，都将以生产能力查定的结果为主要根据。指示规定：凡是没有实事求是确定定额，未切实挖掘潜在能力，未针对弱点提出具体解决方案和实施计划的单位，要迅速再做新的布置，甚至重新查定。凡是制度混乱、定额工作基础不好的单位，要根据生产能力查定的要求，健全制度，整理定额，为一九五三年度的查定工作扫除障碍。
    对于查定完毕的单位，指示要求他们注意巩固已经取得的成果，进一步做好查定工作的总结；在查定工作的基础上编好一九五三年的技术改进措施计划，这项计划要以发挥潜在能力和提高产品质量为中心内容。指示强调指出：提高质量将是一九五三年的重要工作，全国各机械工厂必须把这项工作列为一九五三年的主要任务之一，从各方面着手为改善质量、提高机械工业的技术水平而坚决奋斗！
