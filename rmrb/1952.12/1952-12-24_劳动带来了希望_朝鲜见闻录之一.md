Labor Brings Hope
——Notes from Korea, Part 1
Bai Lang

Editor's Note: Not long ago, the author of this article, along with Mrs. Felton of England, visited Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and other places, and wrote "Notes from Korea." The newspaper will publish three sections of it successively. Each section can stand alone.

At night, enemy planes were unleashing their violence somewhere again, and the bombs shook our doors and windows as if someone was knocking hard. Our house undoubtedly could not withstand the bombing; but we slept particularly soundly. Although we were occasionally awakened by the tremors, we turned over and fell asleep again. On the soil of Korea, there is always the possibility of disaster falling on our heads, but living among the Korean people, we feel very safe at all times. This is not because there are Korean armed comrades monitoring enemy planes around us, nor because there are solid air-raid shelters near the house, nor because there are highly accurate anti-aircraft guns and air force protection, but because we are deeply infected by the unparalleled courage and composure of the Korean people, which adds a lot of confidence and courage to us.

The debt that the enemy owes to the Korean people is really too much, too much. There is no need for me to record this in detail, let the Korean people settle accounts with the enemy. What I want to tell the American aggressors is: this is the seed of hatred you have sown in the hearts of the Korean people; this is the basis for your absolute isolation in front of the people of the world; this is also the fuse for you to set yourselves on fire, and the heroic Korean people will never yield. Look at the following facts.

One morning, we visited the Pyongyang Wartime Disaster Relief Center, which were solid stone caves dug into the ground. Some homeless disaster victims lived in these caves. Although the caves were damp and dark, they could enjoy plenty of sunshine on clear days. Old women were drying quilts with exposed cotton batting and singlets with burnt lapels in the sun. Some children were sunbathing, and some were playing hoop rolling or blind man's buff. Men and women who could work were dismantling bombed houses, and some were actively building with shovels, chisels, axes, and saws. They used the broken bricks, tiles, and remaining wood to rebuild new houses. An old man named Kim Pyong-san told us:

"Our small family has been completely destroyed. But we have a collective big family now. Thanks to the care of the government and the Volunteer Army comrades, we are now well-fed and clothed. We must build this big family better." This old man was already fifty-eight years old, but he had the ambition of a young man.

Near this disaster relief center, I saw an old man with gray hair smearing the last layer of mud on the roof of his newly built cave. When I visited him, he said humorously:

"My home was destroyed along with the crops! But, you see, I am rebuilding my home in the bomb crater created by the enemy, and I built a new cave in three days." It turned out that his cave was built using a bomb crater. Then he told me another thing:

"The enemy's bombs, I don't know what raw materials they are made of, they can simply be used as the best fertilizer." He pointed to a nearby depression and showed me, "That is the land that suffered a month ago, look how fast the grass is growing! When this cave is completed, I plan to plant a large area of autumn vegetables there. I guarantee, there is absolutely no need to fertilize." The old man's words not only expressed his infinite confidence in the future, but also a vivid satire of the enemy.

The high-rise building of the Korean Cultural Propaganda Department faces the beautiful Moranbong Hill. When I came to Pyongyang in April, I had entered this damaged high-rise building several times. Our creative team comrades had held parties and discussions with comrades from the Korean literary and art circles in this building, exchanging creative experiences. That kind of warm friendship is forever unforgettable. Now, the Cultural Propaganda Department has moved elsewhere. The enemy dropped a large number of bombs near this high-rise building, and half of the building was bombed.

In that scorched earth, I wandered, I recalled…. Suddenly, in front of me, appeared a locust tree that had been injured by the bombing. Half of its roots had been dug out of the soil, and its trunk had also bent down. However, strangely, it was not dead; no, maybe it had died once. Now, however, in the dense branches and scorched dead leaves, green shoots have emerged again. I silently thought: Not only the Korean people, but even the trees of Korea have such strong vitality. I hope that when I come again, this extraordinary locust tree will have restored its former lushness.

On the way to the Korean Labor Newspaper Agency, I saw an old woman from a farmer's family irrigating a small flower garden, which was under the window of her dilapidated thatched house. This reminded me of the two large bunches of鲜花 (fresh flowers) that Comrade Park Jung-ai presented to us, which were so bright and beautiful. She once told us that she planted these flowers herself. Later, when we went to her house for a banquet, we saw a large area of flowers in full bloom smiling at the sun in front of her house, which had been bombed fifteen times. Comrade Park Jung-ai said with a smile:

"This is the harvest of my cultivation."

I think this old woman has the same spirit as Comrade Park Jung-ai.

The Korean Labor Newspaper Agency is built in a relatively remote cave. When we arrived, it was not far from dusk. But this doesn't matter at all, anyway, natural light never shines into this dark cave. People working in the cave have to create light with their own hands.

Inside the cave, it is low and damp, but there is enough light. And we, who are not yet accustomed to living in caves, always tiptoe when we walk in, and sometimes we dare not straighten our backs. However, as soon as we see the workers working selflessly, we immediately forget this unnecessary worry.

Among them, probably more than half of the people's homes have been destroyed by the enemy, but their production efficiency is higher than before the war, and the quality is also better than before the war. The typesetting workers are picking up the lead type quickly and carefully, and the printing workers are concentrating on mastering the machine…. All the workers are busy in the sound of扎扎的 (creaking) machines. They are sweating profusely, their faces are covered with ink, and their work clothes are shining with oil stains. Slogans of production competitions and supporting the front line are pasted on the walls. The cave is very narrow, and the air is naturally not very circulated. They work day and night in this small world, creating happiness for the people.

Comrade Li Wenri, the editor-in-chief, led us to visit the entire factory. The pleasant working atmosphere always cheered us up. It is really too shameful to think about personal matters here.

Comrade Li Wenri's office is similar in size to a亭子间 (small room) in Shanghai. When five or six of us walked in, we filled the entire room. And he led all the employees in this small room, delivering spiritual nourishment to all the working people of Korea. 100,000 copies, in wartime Korea, can't be said to be a remarkable number? (It reached 200,000 copies before the war.) The respectable Korean working class is inspiring the will of the Korean people with creative labor, making the entire northern Korea full of hope and confidence. This hope and confidence were more fully expressed in the tea party with the workers. They all expressed their determination with glowing spirits: For justice and truth, for the victory of the motherland, and to thank the selfless assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers and fraternal countries, we vow to devote all our energy and strive for world peace with unremitting labor. A representative of the workers said:

"I hope to bring our determination back to the people of China and the UK, especially the working class brothers in China. We want to learn from them. We want to create a new Korea like the new China."

We kept this earnest exhortation in mind, and bid farewell to our beloved friends in the joyful singing of the "Song of the New Korea." Now I will convey this solemn message to the working class of the motherland.

It should be added here that the Labor Newspaper Agency also publishes a farmers' pictorial, which is a colored periodical. It is not only brightly colored, but also simple and elegant in layout. Under the general titles such as "Extensively Develop Farmer Sericulture" and "Strive to Solve Wartime Clothing Problems," it shows the farmers' production enthusiasm and the new vitality of the countryside. From here, one can foresee the abundant harvest that is about to come in the Korean countryside. All this attracted us, and the next day we went to 新兴里 (Xinxing Village) to visit the countryside.

As soon as we entered the village entrance, a farmer in his forties ran towards us from afar in the rice fields. His name was Jin Delong. When he ran up to us, he enthusiastically stretched out his hands, but when he suddenly noticed the dirt on his hands, he was embarrassed to retract them. We enthusiastically handed him our hands. He showed a simple smile and wiped his palms clean on his pants before shaking hands with us. It was such a lovely farmer, such a touching expression, that made people unable not to like him.

This village has more than 300 households. When the enemy came the year before last, all the cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs in the village were killed, and the chickens and ducks that could not be eaten were loaded into trucks and taken away. Even worse was beating, kidnapping, and killing people, and no one was spared. Last year, many bombs fell on the rice fields, and the losses were incalculable. In the autumn, floods added to the disaster, and all the crops were washed away. All these natural and man-made disasters turned last year's harvest in Xinxing Village into a bubble.

"Relying on the assistance of fraternal countries, we were able to breathe a sigh of relief." The old farmer Jin Daihyun said with tears of gratitude, "This year, the Soviet people sent white flour, and the Chinese people sent coarse grains, which helped us plant the land. It seems that this year's harvest has a 90% chance of success."

Yes, if there are no disasters before the autumn harvest, Xinxing Village will have a remarkable harvest. As far as we can see, isn't that an endless, lush and fertile green field?

Except for a few bombed lands, there is no wasteland in Xinxing Village. Relying on everyone's early-to-late labor, and reasonable mutual assistance and division of labor between men and women, all the land that can grow crops has been planted. In order to accumulate fertilizer, each household also raised a fat pig.

"In rural areas, women are the main labor force." The chairman of the Women's Democratic League said proudly, looking at the women present with loving eyes:

"In order to meet the needs of the war, women have contributed their strength as much as possible. They take care of their children while cultivating the land, and also do some temporary work to support the front line. But the cultivated area is even larger than before the war."

This is not an exaggeration at all. Although she herself bears the important responsibility of organizing women and raises four children, she also plants 6,000 pyeong of land. She is a model of working women, so there is no need to cite other examples.

The farmers of Xinxing Village are confidently waiting for a satisfactory harvest. Now, their wishes have already been realized, right?

    劳动带来了希望
    ——朝鲜见闻录之一
    白朗
    编者按：不久以前，本文作者跟英国费尔顿夫人一起访问了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首都平壤及其他地方，写出了朝鲜见闻录。本报将陆续发表其中三节。每节都可独立成篇。
    夜里，不知敌机又在什么地方大逞淫威，炸弹震得我们的门窗像有人猛敲一样。我们的房子，无疑的是抵抗不了轰炸的；但我们却睡得格外香甜。虽然也偶尔被震醒，但翻个身又睡熟了。在朝鲜的土地上，随时都有灾难落在头上的可能性，但我们生活在朝鲜人民中间，在任何时候都感到非常安全。这倒不是由于我们的周围有朝鲜武装同志在监视着敌机，也不是由于房子左近有着坚固的防空洞，也不是因为有着百发百中的高射炮和空军的保卫，而是被朝鲜人民无比的果敢和镇定深深感染了，使我们平添了不少的信心和勇气。
    敌人欠下朝鲜人民的血债实在太多了，太多了。这个用不着我来详细记载，留给朝鲜人民去跟敌人清算吧。我所要告诉美国侵略者的是：这就是你们撒在朝鲜人民心灵上的仇恨的种籽；这就是你们在全世界人民面前造成绝对孤立的根据；这也就是你们纵火焚身的引火线，而英雄的朝鲜人民是永远也不会屈服的。再看看下面的事实吧。
    在一个上午，我们访问了平壤市战时灾民收容所，那是些凿在地面上的坚固的石洞。一些无家可归的劫后灾黎，就住在这些石洞里。洞里虽然潮湿而黑暗，但是，在晴朗的日子里他们却可以享受充足的阳光。老大娘在太阳底下翻晒着露着棉絮的被褥和烧掉衣襟的汗衫。孩子们有的晒太阳，有的在掷铁环或蒙着眼睛捉迷藏。能够劳动的男人和女人，则在拆除被炸塌的房子，有的挥动锹、凿、斧、锯在积极修建。他们就利用那些碎砖断瓦和残余的木料重盖着新房。老人金平山对我们说：
    “我们的小家庭，是毁得一干二净了。可是我们又有了个集体的大家庭。感谢政府和志愿军同志对我们的照顾，现在我们得到温饱了。我们一定要把这个大家庭建设得更好。”这老人已经五十八岁了，却有着青年人的雄心。
    在这个灾民收容所的附近，我看见一个须发斑白的老大爷正向他新搭的洞子顶上抹着最后一层泥浆。当我访问他的时候，他幽默地说：
    “我的家早和庄稼一起毁掉了！可是，你看，我又在敌人造成的炸弹坑里重整家园，三天就把新洞搭好了。”原来他的洞子是利用弹坑盖的。接着他又告诉我另一件事：
    “敌人的炸弹可不知是什么原料做的，简直可以做最好的肥料。”他指着左近一片洼地给我看，“那就是一个月以前遭过难的土地，你看，草长的多快！等这个洞子完工，我计划在那儿种一大片秋菜呢。我敢保，完全用不着上粪。”老大爷的话，不但表现了他对前途的无限信心，而且是对敌人的生动的讽刺。
    朝鲜文化宣传省的高楼，斜对着绮丽的牡丹峰，我四月间来平壤的时候，曾经几次走进这座曾遭破坏的高楼。我们创作组的同志，曾在这座楼里和朝鲜文艺界的同志们联欢、座谈，交流着创作经验，那种热烈的友谊，是永远令人难忘的。现在，文化宣传省已经搬到别处去了。敌人在这高楼附近，投了大量的炸弹，这座楼被炸塌了半边。
    在那一片焦土中，我徘徊着，我回忆着……。突然，在我的面前，出现了一株被炸伤的槐树，它的根已经半边掘出土了，树干也弯下了身子，然而，奇怪的是，它竟没有死；不，也许它曾经一度死去。如今却在那密密的枝桠间，在那焦枯的败叶中，又发出了青青的嫩芽。我默默地想：不但是朝鲜人民，就连朝鲜的树，生命力也竟是这样的强。但愿当我再来的时候，这棵不平凡的槐树，已经恢复往日的繁茂。
    在去朝鲜劳动新闻社的途中，我看见了一个农家的老大娘在灌溉一个小花圃，这个小花圃就在她那所倾倒的破草房窗下。这使我想起了朴正爱同志献给我们的那两大把鲜花，那花儿是那样的鲜艳美丽。她曾经告诉我们，这些花是她自己亲自栽种的。后来我们到她家里去赴宴时，果然看见在她那座被炸坏过十五次的房子的门前，有一大片盛开的鲜花在迎着太阳微笑。朴正爱同志笑着说：
    “这就是我耕耘的收获。”
    我想这位老大娘正有着朴正爱同志同样的精神。
    朝鲜劳动新闻社，是建设在一个比较偏僻的山洞里，我们到的时候，离黄昏不远了。但是，这完全没有关系，反正，天然的光亮，对这黑暗的山洞，是从不照顾的。工作在洞子里的人，要用自己的手创造光明。
    洞里边，低矮而潮湿，却有着足够的光亮。而我们还没习惯洞居的人，走进去总不免蹑手蹑脚，有时候，腰板也不敢伸直。可是，一看见在忘我劳动中的工友们，立刻就忘掉这种不必要的担心了。
    他们之中，可能有一半以上的人的家被敌人毁掉了，而他们的生产效率却比战前更高，质量也比战前更好。排字工人敏捷而认真地拣着铅字，印刷工人全神贯注地掌握着机器……。所有的工人都忙碌于扎扎的机器声中。他们挥汗如雨，脸上是一道道的油墨，身上的工作服闪着油渍的光。墙壁上贴着生产竞赛、支援前线的大字标语。洞子很窄，空气自然不很流通。他们就日日夜夜劳动在这个小天地中，为人民创造着幸福。
    主笔李文日同志领着我们参观了整个工厂，那种愉快的劳动气氛使我们始终振奋，在这里如果再去想什么个人的事情，真是太可耻了。
    李文日同志的办公室和上海的亭子间大小相似，我们五六个人一走进去，就把整个房间塞满了。而他就在这小房里领导着全社员工，为朝鲜全体劳动人民输送着精神给养。十万份，这在战时的朝鲜说来，能说不是一个了不起的数字吗？（战前达二十万份。）可敬的朝鲜工人阶级，他们正以创造性的劳动，鼓舞着朝鲜人民的意志，使整个朝鲜北部，充满了希望和信心。这种希望和信心，在和工友的茶话会上，更充分地表现出来了。他们个个精神焕发地表示着决心：为了正义和真理，为了祖国的胜利，为了答谢中国人民志愿军及各兄弟国家无私的援助，誓必付出所有的精力，用不息的劳动争取世界和平。工友代表说：
    “希望把我们的决心带回给中英两国的人民，特别是中国的工人阶级弟兄。我们要向他们看齐。我们要创造一个和新中国一样的新朝鲜。”
    我们牢记了这恳切的叮嘱，在愉快的“新朝鲜之歌”的歌声中和敬爱的朋友们告别了。现在我就把这庄严的寄语，转达给祖国的工人阶级吧。
    应该在这里补述的是，劳动新闻社还出版有农民画报，这是一种套色的定期画刊，它不但色彩鲜明，编排也朴素大方。在“广泛开展农家蚕业”、
    “为解决战时衣类问题而奋斗”一类的总标题下，展现了农民的生产热忱和农村的新生气象，从这里，可以预见到朝鲜农村即将到来的丰饶收成。这
    一切吸引着我们，第二天我们便到新兴里去访问农村。
    我们一进村口，稻田里就有一个四十多岁的农民老远地向我们跑来。他叫金德龙。他跑到我们面前，便热情地伸出了两手，可是，当他忽然发现了手上的泥土时，竟又不好意思地缩回去了。我们热情地把手递给他，他现出朴素的笑容，把手掌向裤子上抹抹干净才和我们握手。是这样一个可爱的农民，是这样一付动人的表情，真叫人不能不喜欢他。
    这个村庄有三百多户人家，前年敌人来时，村里的牛羊猪狗全被杀光，吃不了的鸡鸭便一齐装车运走。更甚的是打人、拉人、杀人，没有一家能够幸免灾祸的。去年稻田里落过很多次炸弹，损失是不可计算的，入秋，洪水又助桀为虐，庄稼全冲跑了。这一切的天灾人祸，使去年新兴里的丰收化为泡影。
    “依靠兄弟国家的援助，这口气才算缓了过来。”老农民金戴炫闪动着感激的泪眼说，“今年苏联人民送白面，中国人民送杂粮，算是把地种上了，看起来，今年的丰收有了九成指望了。”
    是的，假如秋收前不发生什么灾害的话，新兴里将有一个了不起的丰收。在我们目力所及的地方，那不是一望无垠、茁壮肥美的油绿色的田野吗？
    除了个别被炸的土地而外，新兴里没有一片荒地，依靠大家起早贪黑的劳动，男女合理的互助分工，凡是能长庄稼的地全种上了。为了积肥，每家还喂了一口肥猪。
    “农村中，妇女是主要劳动力。”里民主妇女同盟委员长用昵爱的眼光望着在座的妇女们自豪地说：
    “为了供应战争的需要，妇女们都尽量地贡献了自己的力量。她们一面抚养孩子，一面耕种土地，另外还做些支援前线的临时工作。但耕地的面积却比战前还大。”
    这丝毫都不是夸口。她自己虽然担负着组织妇女的重大责任，抚养着四个小孩，还种了六千坪地。她正是劳动妇女的典范，其他的例子也就无须再举了。
    新兴里农民都很有信心地等待着一个美满的丰收。现在，他们的愿望早已实现了吧？
