The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Cultural and Educational Committee convened its fourth plenary session on December 1st. Ninety-six committee members, heads of cultural and educational departments (bureaus, sections) from various provinces and cities, and first-level personnel from the Northwest region attended or were present as observers. The meeting lasted six days and concluded on December 6th. The central topic of the meeting was: based on the spirit of Director Yang Mingxuan's general report, "Striving for Cultural and Educational Work During the Period of Economic Construction," to discuss and formulate the 1953 Northwest education, culture, and news publishing construction plan (the health plan was not submitted for discussion because many cadres from the Northwest Health Department were attending the Second National Health Conference and will be discussed at a separate health administration meeting). All attendees and observers conducted lively discussions on the draft plans prepared by the education, culture, and news publishing departments. Through group and plenary discussions, the direction, priorities, and specific tasks of the 1953 cultural and educational plans became clearer and more practical.

The meeting believed that since the third plenary session of the Northwest Cultural and Educational Committee in October of last year, the cultural and educational undertakings in the Northwest had made significant progress and development. In particular, the achievements in the two major movements of ideological remolding and patriotic health are even more prominent. The former laid the ideological foundation for welcoming large-scale national economic and cultural construction; the latter popularized mass health work, improved the health level of the broad masses, and at the same time, increased the material strength for the upcoming large-scale national construction.

The meeting pointed out that in order to cooperate with the upcoming large-scale economic construction, it is necessary to improve the leadership level of cultural and educational departments with a new work spirit and work methods. The most important link is to strengthen the planning and overall concept of cultural and educational work, and oppose the blindness in work and the isolated tendency of each going its own way. The meeting emphasized that cultural and educational plans must overcome the tendency to simply pursue numbers. More importantly, the quality of the work must reach a certain standard. This requires all departments to strengthen the work of cultivating cadres, strengthen in-depth inspections of work, and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

During the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and Ma Mingfang, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, both attended and spoke. Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun gave extremely sincere instructions on the Northwest's cultural and educational construction work. He pointed out that the biggest difficulty in today's national construction work is the lack of talent. The task of the cultural and educational departments is to cultivate a large number of construction talents for the country. Cultural and educational workers are engineers of the human soul. Without cultural and educational work, there is no industrialization of the country. Any tendency to underestimate cultural and educational work is extremely backward thinking. He asked cultural and educational workers to pay attention to reality and go deep into reality; only in this way can cultural and educational work play its great role in the upsurge of large-scale national economic and cultural construction. Vice Chairman Xi then gave detailed instructions on the issue of formulating cultural and educational plans. He said that the formulation of the plan itself must first involve a major review of past work to discover problems and solve them; only in this way can the formulated plan be practical, rather than an empty, bureaucratic plan. He said that when formulating the plan, the base number must first be clarified, all numbers must be based on evidence, all work requirements must have certain standards and specifications, quality must be emphasized, blind development is not allowed, and the idea of laying the foundation for more and better results is opposed. He required leaders of all departments to formulate plans themselves, grasp the key points; in the future, the focus of cultural and educational work should first be education and health work, and the focus of education work should first be on running university education and secondary education well; the focus of health work should be on continuing to carry out the patriotic health movement, cultivating cadres, and running outpatient clinics well. Speaking of eliminating illiteracy, Vice Chairman Xi instructed that the focus next year should be on "preparing cadres and conducting typical trials." Speaking of culture, he emphasized that leadership over the reform of old dramas should be strengthened. He pointed out that this large number of national art forms that are popular among the broad masses must be given full attention.

Vice Chairman Ma Mingfang profoundly and incisively elaborated on the development of rural production mutual aid and cooperation after the land reform, and the inevitable cultural construction upsurge brought about by large-scale national construction. He said that the organization of farmers has brought about tremendous changes in the farmers' ideology, lifestyle, and cultural requirements. This requires our cultural work to adapt to this new change, reflect this new change, and guide and develop this new demand of workers and peasants. Regarding the relationship between national industrialization and cultural construction, he said: Without the improvement of the people's cultural and scientific knowledge, there can be no national industrialization, because industrialization cannot be built on the backwardness and ignorance of the people. Therefore, cultural and educational work shoulders an extremely important task for the construction of national industrialization.

On the last day of the meeting, Zhang Jiafu, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, summarized the issues discussed at the meeting and gave the following instructions on future cultural and educational work: First, school education work must reach a certain quantity and a certain standard, and quality and quantity must be given equal importance. Higher education is the last place to cultivate talents. Therefore, the specifications are particularly important. The common problems in school education today are the problems of teachers and equipment, which must be gradually solved in a planned and focused manner. The primary problem is that a certain number of cadres must be sent to the schools to strengthen the ideological and political leadership of the schools. He emphasized that the chaotic phenomena in school work must be resolutely corrected, such as excessive extracurricular activities and casually mobilizing teachers and students to participate in various social activities. He pointed out that the common central task of school administration and the Party and the League is to ensure the completion of the teaching plan. Second, health is a major issue related to the people's health. In the future, cultural committees at all levels must firmly grasp the leadership of this work, strengthen the ideological and political education of medical personnel, and improve the quality of health work. Third, the focus of cultural work should be on vigorously cultivating cadres and strengthening the leadership of worker-peasant literary and artistic activities. Next year, Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City should focus on drama reform, and pay attention to the rectification and improvement of amateur theater troupes; Gansu Province can give equal importance to both, but because there are more other central tasks at present, it can be carried out with emphasis; Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces should focus on promoting comprehensive propaganda teams with movies and medical treatment as the main content. Fourth, in terms of news and publishing, the focus should be on publishing popular reading materials. There should not be too many types, but the quality should be high and the circulation should be large. Fifth, regarding the issue of carrying out patriotic cultural and educational work competitions, this is the best way to promote the enthusiasm of the broad masses, summarize advanced work experience, and improve leadership methods. Each province and city should strive to hold them separately in the summer of next year. Finally, Deputy Director Zhang Jiafu gave instructions on the issue of formulating plans: He said that the plan must be based on the requirements of the country and the actual needs of the local area, which is the basis for formulating the plan. Therefore, the plan must have a base number, strengthen investigation and research work, and resolutely oppose the bureaucratic investigation method of pushing down from level to level. Investigation and research should be carried out by county, using a combination of general surveys and typical surveys. Finally, he called on everyone to step up the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR".

    西北军政委员会文教委员会第四次会议
    讨论并制订明年西北文教建设计划
    习仲勋同志指出今后文教工作重点首先是教育工作和卫生工作
    西北军政委员会文化教育委员会于十二月一日起召开了第四次全体委员会议，出席委员和各省、市列席文教厅（局、处）长及西北区一级列席人员共九十六人，会议历时六日，已于十二月六日闭幕。会议的中心议题是：根据杨明轩主任的总报告“为开展经济建设时期的文教工作而奋斗”的精神，讨论并制订了一九五三年西北教育、文化、新闻出版的建设计划（卫生计划因西北卫生部许多干部正参加第二届全国卫生会议，未提出讨论，将另召集卫生行政会议讨论）。所有出席、列席人员均对教育、文化、新闻出版各部、处所拟的计划草案进行了热烈的讨论。经过小组和大会讨论，使一九五三年各项文教计划的方针、重点和具体任务更加明确与切合实际。
    会议认为：从去年十月西北文委第三次全体会议以来，西北的文化教育事业有了显著进步和发展，特别是思想改造和爱国卫生两大运动方面的成就，就更显得突出。前者为迎接国家大规模的经济建设与文化建设打下了思想基础；后者普及了群众性的卫生工作，提高了广大群众的健康水平，同时也就为即将到来的大规模的国家建设增加了物质的力量。
    会议指出：为了配合即将开始的大规模经济建设，就必须以新的工作精神和工作方法来提高文教部门的领导水平，其中最重要的环节就是加强文教工作的计划性和整体观念，反对工作中的盲目性和各自为政的孤立主义倾向。会议强调指出，文教计划必须克服单纯追求数字倾向，更重要的是使工作的质量要达到一定的规格。这就要求各部门加强培养干部的工作，加强对工作的深入检查，并努力学习苏联的先进经验。
    会议期间，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副主任、西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋同志和西北军政委员会马明方副主席都到会讲话。习仲勋副主任对西北的文教建设工作作了极为恳切的指示。他指出，今天国家建设工作中最大的困难就是人才不足，文教部门的任务就是为国家培养大量的建设人才，文教工作者就是人类灵魂的工程师，没有文教工作就谈不到国家的工业化，任何轻视文教工作的倾向都是极其落后的思想。他要求文教工作者要重视实际，深入实际；如此，文教工作才能在国家大规模的经济建设和文化建设高潮中起其伟大的作用。习副主任继就制订文教计划的问题作了详尽的指示。他说，制订计划的本身首先就必须把过去的工作来一番大检查，发现问题，解决问题；如此，订出的计划才是切合实际的，而不是空洞的官僚主义的计划。他说制订计划时要先把基数搞清楚，一切数字的提出都要有根据，对各项工作要求都要有一定的标准和规格，必须讲求质量，不许盲目发展，反对多多益善的铺摊子思想。他要求一切部门的领导人都必须自己动手制订计划，掌握重点；今后文教工作的重点首先是教育工作和卫生工作，教育工作首先又应以办好大学教育和中学教育为重点；卫生工作应以继续开展爱国卫生运动、培养干部和办好门诊为重点。谈到扫除文盲工作，习副主任指示明年主要应以“准备干部、典型试办”为重点。谈到文化方面，他强调应加强对旧剧改革的领导，他指出对于这一大量存在的为广大群众所喜闻乐见的民族艺术形式，必须予以充分的注意。
    马明方副主席深刻而精辟地阐述了土地改革后，农村生产互助合作的发展，及国家大规模建设必然带来的文化建设高潮。他说，农民的被组织起来，这就在农民的思想形态上、生活形式上以及文化要求上都引起了巨大的变化。这就要求我们的文化工作要适应这种新的变化，反映这种新的变化，并指导与发展工人和农民的这种新的要求。关于国家工业化与文化建设的关系，他说：没有人民文化科学知识的提高，就不可能有国家的工业化，因为工业化不能建筑在人民的落后与无知上面。所以，文化教育工作对于国家工业化的建设是肩负着极重要的任务的。
    会议最后一日，西北军政委员会文化教育委员会张稼夫副主任就会议所讨论的问题做了总结，并对今后文教工作作了如下指示：第一、学校教育工作，要求达到一定的数量，也要求达到一定的规格，必须质量并重。高等教育是培养人才的最后场所。所以规格特别重要。今天学校教育中普遍存在的问题为师资问题和设备问题，必须有计划、有重点地逐步予以解决。首要的问题就是必须派一定数量的干部到学校中去，加强学校的思想政治领导。他强调提出必须坚决纠正学校工作中的混乱现象，如过多的课外活动与随便动员师生参加各种社会活动等。他指出，学校行政和党、团的共同的中心任务就是保证教学计划的完成。第二、卫生事业是关系人民健康的重大问题，今后各级文委必须抓紧领导这一工作，加强对医药人员的思想政治教育，提高卫生工作的质量。第三、文化工作的重点应是大力培养干部，加强对工农文艺活动的领导。明年陕西省与西安市应以戏剧改革为工作重点，并注意对业余剧团的整顿与改进；甘肃省可以二者并重，但由于当前其他中心工作较多，可以有重点地去进行；青海、宁夏和新疆三省则应以推广以电影、医疗为主的综合宣传队为工作重点。第四、新闻出版方面：应以刊行通俗读物为主，种类不要太多，但质量要高，发行数量要大。第五、关于开展爱国主义文教工作竞赛问题，这是发扬广大群众积极性，总结先进工作经验，改进领导方法的最好形式，各省、市应争取于明年夏季分别举行。最后张稼夫副主任对制订计划问题作了指示：他说计划必须从国家要求和当地实际的需要出发，这是制订计划的根据。因此，计划必须要有基数，要加强调查研究工作，要坚决反对那种一级一级往下推的官僚主义的调查方法。调查研究应以县为单位，采取概况调查和典型调查相结合的办法进行。最后，他号召大家要加紧学习苏共第十九次代表大会文件和斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。
