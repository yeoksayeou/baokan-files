    New Atmosphere in People's Courts of Various Counties in Cangxian Prefecture
    To the Editor: After the judicial reform movement, the People's Courts of various counties in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, which originally had quite serious old legal views and old judicial styles, have begun to change.
    Although some county People's Courts in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, began to implement the policy of "handling cases through the mass line" at the beginning of this year, the improvement of work was not significant because the cadres' thinking had not been raised, so it was just a formal "relocation of the court." In this judicial reform movement, cadres of the People's Courts of various counties understood the superiority of handling cases through the mass line from an ideological perspective, and changed the bad habits of sitting in court to hear cases, not investigating or researching, listening to one side, and even replacing policies with emotions in practical actions. In particular, those cadres who did not believe in the mass line in the past have felt that "it is too slow and uncertain to handle cases in the office," and have asked to go to the countryside to handle cases. From November 3rd to 15th, in just over ten days, according to statistics from Hejian and other eight counties and two towns, 534 cases were handled through the mass line. The cadres realized that handling cases in this way is not only fast and accurate, but also conducive to the unity and production of farmers, and can improve the policy level of district and village cadres and the masses, consolidate the people's own organizations for mediating disputes, and strengthen the ties between the government and the people. In the past, many judicial cadres had a style of banging on the table, glaring, being rude, and dragging their feet. Now this style has basically disappeared. Some cadres said painfully: "In the past, we were not patient in persuading and educating the parties involved, and our attitude was rude. This was because we lacked a mass perspective, did not believe in the masses, and it was also a kind of thought and style of ruling the people. In the future, if the problem cannot be solved, it must be taken to the masses to solve." Yang Baoshan and two others from Nandapu Village in Cangxian County went to the county People's Court to file a lawsuit. Because it was late and it was raining, it was difficult to go home. Li Yufeng, the vice president of the court, and others took out their quilts and arranged for them to stay overnight. Yang Baoshan said gratefully: "Our People's Court is really different from the courts of the old society. In the past, let alone rain, even if it was raining knives, we had to leave. You must come to our house for a few days when you go to the countryside to work in the future." The People's Courts of various counties have also begun to pay attention to in-depth investigation and research to prevent wrongful arrests and arbitrary violations of human rights. For example, in the case of Guo Wenqiang in Shihuitun Village, Jianguo County, the district people's government repeatedly asked the court to arrest Guo, but the court first sent people to investigate. The result confirmed that Guo was falsely accused due to private enmity, and of course should not be arrested. As Li Ruisheng, the president of the court, said: "Before the judicial reform, even five Guo Wenqiangs would have been arrested long ago." In addition, in handling marriage cases, we are also beginning to eliminate the remaining "male chauvinist" ideas among cadres. Many counties are actively dealing with wrongly judged marriage cases. The Hejian County People's Court has corrected the erroneous judgments that disregarded women's interests in three marriage cases, including that of Song Xiuzhen.
    The judicial reform movement has enabled the cadres of the People's Courts of various counties in Cangxian Prefecture to establish the ideological style of being "people's servants," and has also greatly enhanced the prestige of the People's Courts among the masses.

### 沧县专区各县人民法院的新气象

    沧县专区各县人民法院的新气象
    编辑同志：经过了司法改革运动，原来有着相当严重的旧法观点和旧司法作风的河北省沧县专区各县人民法院，开始变样了。
    河北省沧县专区某些县人民法院，虽然从今年初就开始实行了“走群众路线办案”的方针，但因为干部思想没有提高，所以只是形式上的“法庭搬家”，工作改进不大。在这次司法改革运动中，各县人民法院干部从思想上领会了群众路线办案的优越性，并从实际行动中转变了过去那些坐堂问案、不调查不研究、偏听偏信甚至以感情代政策的恶劣作风。特别是过去不相信群众路线的干部，都已感到“坐机关办案太慢，没把握”，纷纷要求下乡办案。从十一月三日到十五日十余天中，据河间等八县二个镇的统计，即曾经走群众路线办了五百三十四件案子。干部们体会到这样办案，不但迅速、正确，而且利于农民的团结生产，并能提高区、村干部和群众的政策水平，巩固群众自己的调解纠纷的组织，密切政府和群众的联系。过去，许多司法干部对群众有着拍桌子、瞪眼睛和蛮横、拖拉的作风。现在这种作风基本上绝迹了。有的干部沉痛地说：“过去对当事人不耐心说服教育，态度蛮横，是我们缺乏群众观点，不相信群众，也是一种统治人民的思想作风。今后，如果问题不能解决，一定拿到群众中去解决。”沧县南大铺村杨宝山等三人到该县人民法院起诉，因天晚了，又下着雨，回家有困难，该院副院长李玉峰等便主动抽出自己的被褥，安置他们住宿。杨宝山感激地说：“咱们的人民法院真和旧社会的法院不同。过去，别说下雨，就是下刀子也非走不可。你们以后下乡工作，可一定到我们家去住几天。”各县人民法院还开始注意深入调查研究的工作，防止了错捕和随意侵犯人权的现象。如建国县石灰屯村郭文强被控案，区人民政府再三要求法院把郭逮捕，但法院却先派人去调查，结果证实郭是因私仇被诬告的，当然不应该逮捕。正如该院院长李瑞升说的：“司法改革前，就是五个郭文强也早就逮捕了。”另外，在处理婚姻案件方面，也在开始清除干部中的“大男子主义”残余思想。许多县正积极地处理错判了的婚姻案。河间县人民法院已经纠正了宋秀珍等三件婚姻案中漠视妇女利益的错误判决。
    司法改革运动使沧县专区各县人民法院干部树立了做“人民勤务员”的思想作风，也大大提高了人民法院在群众中的威信。
