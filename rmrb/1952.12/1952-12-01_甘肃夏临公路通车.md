    Gansu's Xiahe-Linxia Highway Opens to Traffic
    [Xinhua News Agency] More than 10,000 Tibetan, Hui, and Han people from Xiahe County (i.e., Labrang) in Gansu Province held a meeting on November 17 to celebrate the opening of the Xiahe-Linxia Highway. Zhang Desheng, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ma Hongbin, Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, and others attended the meeting and spoke, explaining the important significance of the opening of the Xiahe-Linxia Highway for the development of the economy and culture of the Tibetan people in southern Gansu. The meeting also sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The Xiahe-Linxia Highway runs from Xiahe to Linxia in Gansu Province, with a total length of 103 kilometers. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was built three times from 1928 to 1947, but it was never completed. In order to further develop the economy and culture of the Tibetan people, promote material exchange, and improve the lives of the Tibetan people, the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Gansu Provincial People's Government decided to build the Xiahe-Linxia Highway in the first half of this year and planned to open it to traffic by the end of the year. Construction began on August 17. With the active assistance of the people of all ethnic groups along the line, especially the Tibetan people, and the efforts of all the highway workers, it was officially opened to traffic on November 15, one and a half months ahead of schedule. At this point, the Xiahe-Linxia Highway and the Linxia-Lanzhou Highway were connected. The opening of the Xiahe-Linxia Highway is of great significance to the economic development of the Tibetan people in southern Gansu. In the past, when large quantities of furs, native products, and special products produced in the Tibetan areas were exported, the freight rates were very high due to transportation difficulties, which affected foreign sales. At the same time, the fabrics, tea, grain, and daily necessities needed by the Tibetan people were also particularly expensive due to transportation difficulties. The opening of the Xiahe-Linxia Highway will greatly change this situation. The Tibetan people of Labrang expressed a very warm welcome to the opening of the Xiahe-Linxia Highway. When the first batch of trucks loaded with daily necessities traveled from Lanzhou to Labrang, the masses along the Xiahe-Linxia Highway lined the streets to welcome them. The people of all ethnic groups in Labrang were as happy as if they were celebrating a festival, and the Tibetan people also used dancing and horse racing to express their celebration of the opening of the Xiahe-Linxia Highway.

    甘肃夏临公路通车
    【新华社讯】甘肃省夏河县（即拉卜楞）藏、回、汉等族人民一万多人十一月十七日开会庆祝夏（河）临（夏）公路通车。中国共产党甘肃省委员会书记张德生、甘肃省人民政府副主席马鸿宾等都参加了这个大会，并在大会上讲话，说明夏临公路通车对发展甘肃南部藏区人民经济、文化的重要意义。大会并电毛主席致敬。夏临公路自甘肃省夏河至临夏，全长一百零三公里。这条公路在国民党反动派统治时期，从一九二八年到一九四七年曾先后修过三次，但始终没有修通。西北军政委员会及甘肃省人民政府为了进一步发展藏族人民的经济、文化，开展物资交流，改善藏民生活，今年上半年决定修筑夏临公路，并计划在年底通车。自八月十七日开工后，在沿线各族人民，特别是在藏族人民的积极协助及全路员工的努力下，较原计划提前了一个半月，在十一月十五日正式通车，至此，夏临公路和临夏通兰州的公路便衔接起来。夏临公路的通车，对发展甘肃南部藏区人民经济意义很大，过去藏区出产的大批皮毛及土产品和特产品向外输出时，由于运输上的困难，运价很高，影响外销。同时藏区人民需要的布匹、茶叶、粮食及日用品等，也因运输困难，就特别昂贵。夏临公路的通车，将会大大改变这种情况。拉卜楞藏族人民对夏临公路通车表示非常欢迎。当第一批汽车满载着日用品自兰州开往拉卜楞时，夏临公路沿线群众夹道欢迎。拉卜楞的各族人民像过节日一样地欢喜，藏族人民还用跳舞、赛马来表示自己对夏临公路通车的庆祝。
