　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 2nd: Three American spies were executed in Pyongyang on November 30th. These three spies, Jin Yushan, Yuan Yingsuo, and Ren Zhencheng (all transliterations), carrying radio transceivers, signal guns, and weapons, parachuted from an American aircraft.

　　They were caught on the spot while engaging in espionage activities. They confessed to repeatedly using the radio to inform the U.S. military of the concentration points of civilians, which were later bombed by American aircraft. When American bandits conducted night air raids on Pyongyang, these spies used flares to indicate the locations of air-raid shelters, basements, and residences. In this way, they participated in the crime of mass murder of residents. The military court sentenced these traitors and murderers to death by hanging.

　　美特务三人在平壤被处死刑
    【新华社讯】塔斯社平壤二日电：美国特务三人于十一月三十日在平壤被处死刑。这三个特务金玉山、袁英索和任真成（均译音），曾带着无线电收发报机、信号枪和武器从一架美国飞机上空降下来。
    他们在进行特务活动时当场被捕。他们供认曾一再用无线电把平民的集中地点告诉美军，后来这些地点就遭到美国飞机的轰炸。当美国强盗对平壤进行夜间空袭时，这些特务就以信号弹指示防空洞、地窟和住宅的位置。这样，他们参加了大规模屠杀居民的罪行。军事法庭判决对这几个卖国贼和杀人犯处以绞刑。
