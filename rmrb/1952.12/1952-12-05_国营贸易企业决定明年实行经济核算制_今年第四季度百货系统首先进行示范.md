State-Owned Trading Enterprises Decide to Implement Economic Accounting System Next Year
    Department Store System to Conduct Demonstrations First This Fourth Quarter

    In order to more effectively leverage the operational enthusiasm of state-owned trade, accumulate funds, improve commodity circulation, better enhance planning and organization, unite various economic components to serve production and people's lives, and welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, has decided that state-owned trading enterprises will fully implement the economic accounting system in 1953, and has determined that the department store system will first implement demonstrations in the fourth quarter of this year. The Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government convened a national department store professional meeting from September 15th to October 4th to specifically study this issue. The specific methods and implementation steps are as follows: 1. Institutional setup: Based on the characteristics of cities with concentrated light industrial production and the situation of import ports, adopt a combination of procurement and distribution; the supply of cities that are material collection and distribution centers adopts a combination of supply and wholesale; in sales operations, adopt the principle of separating retail and wholesale, and set up management and operation institutions separately. 2. Capital assessment: Under the unified leadership of China Department Store Corporation and the principle of level-by-level responsibility of companies at all levels, based on the operating tasks of each level, it is temporarily divided into three levels: central, large administrative region, and province (city), and the funds are assessed to directly operating units. (Central Department Store Wholesale Station, Regional Department Store Wholesale Station, Provincial (Municipal) Department Stores.) 3. Under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, department store companies at all levels are led by both their directly superior companies and the commercial administrative departments at their respective levels; procurement, supply, and wholesale stations at all levels are under the dual leadership of their directly superior companies and the local commercial administrative departments. It is also required that all localities immediately deploy, actively establish procurement, supply, and wholesale stations through the completion of the fourth quarter plan, to ensure the gradual implementation of the economic accounting system in the department store system.

    Since the national financial and economic unification in March 1950, state-owned trade has consistently adopted the operating method of highly centralized funds and unified allocation of commodities. This has played a significant role in further consolidating the national financial and economic unification, stabilizing prices, regulating supply, and flexibly using funds to focus on supporting industrial production. However, with the fundamental improvement of the national financial and economic situation and the complete stabilization of prices, the "large recall" system itself has hindered the completion of new tasks. Because the centralized use of funds and the unified allocation of commodities not only led to waste in funds and time, increased commodity circulation costs, but also hindered the careful calculation of operations in various localities, fostered the idea of supply system, and affected accurate supply. And the department store system, due to the rapid development of institutions and businesses, and the wide variety of goods operated, has seen more widespread and serious phenomena such as capital and commodity backlog, slow turnover, imbalance of supply and demand, and improper allocation. This is completely incompatible with the current needs of national construction and people's lives, and the scientific method to fundamentally solve this contradiction is to strictly implement the economic accounting system.

    The economic accounting system is a scientific method for managing and operating enterprises. The specific content of the economic accounting system of state-owned trading enterprises is roughly as follows:

    (1) Establish a rational and sound enterprise structure so that, under the principle of national financial and economic policies, it can implement enterprise-based management and planned accumulation of national funds. (2) Economic accounting enterprise units should be the compilation units of various plans and take the responsibility of completing and exceeding various established plans as their goal. (3) Should have its own funds, including fixed assets and working capital, that have been assessed as necessary to complete the plan. (4) Economic accounting enterprises have the right to enter into specific supply and sales contracts with buyers or sellers within their established plan, and are materially responsible for the performance of the contract. (5) Establish various systems: such as a clear responsibility system, a strict inspection system, and a correct quota system. (6) Within the loan plan approved by the superior, have the right to obtain loans from the state bank necessary to complete the plan. (7) Provide appropriate rewards to staff members for completing or exceeding the plan. All of these must be guaranteed by the state bank's supervision of funds, precise calculation, and systematic inspection.

    To implement economic accounting in the state-owned trade system, it is first necessary to launch an inspection movement on business management. Through in-depth and specific inspections, and calculating losses, we must prompt all employees—especially cadres—to deeply recognize the damage that the supply system ideology causes to national economic construction today. On this basis, we will launch rationalization proposals to gradually implement the economic accounting system. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国营贸易企业决定明年实行经济核算制
    今年第四季度百货系统首先进行示范
    为了更有效地发挥国营贸易的经营积极性，积累资金，改善商品流转，更好地增强计划性、组织性，团结各种经济成分为生产及人民生活服务，迎接就要到来的大规模经济建设，中央人民政府商业部已遵照政务院财政经济委员会的指示，决定国营贸易企业在一九五三年全部实行经济核算制，并确定今年第四季度先在百货系统实施示范。中央人民政府商业部已于九月十五日至十月四日召开了全国百货专业会议，专门研究这个问题。具体的方法与实施步骤如下：一、机构设置：按轻工业集中生产城市的特点，和进口口岸的情况，采取采购与分配相结合；物资集散城市的供应采取供应与批发相结合；销售业务上采取零售与批发分开的原则，分别设置管理与经营机构。二、资金核定：在中国百货公司统一领导及各级公司逐级负责的原则下，根据各级经营任务，暂划分为中央、大行政区、省
    （市）三级，并将资金核定于直接经营单位。（中央百货批发站，区百货批发站，省（市）百货商店。）三、在中央人民政府商业部统一领导下，各级百货公司除受直属上级公司领导外，并受各该级商业行政部门领导；各级采购供应批发站由其直属上级公司及所在地之商业行政部门双重领导。并要求各地立即部署，通过第四季度计划的完成，积极建立采购供应批发站，保证经济核算制在百货系统的逐步实施。
    自一九五○年三月全国财政经济统一以来，国营贸易一直采取资金高度集中和商品统一调拨的经营方法。这对进一步巩固国家财政经济统一，稳定物价，调剂供应及机动使用资金重点扶植工业生产上，都起了巨大的作用。但随着国家财政经济情况的根本好转与物价的完全稳定，这个“大回笼”制度本身已妨碍新任务的完成。因为资金的集中使用与商品的统一调拨，不仅形成了资金与时间上的浪费，增加了商品的流转费用，而且也妨碍了各地在经营上的精打细算，助长了供给制思想，影响了准确的供应。而百货系统由于机构、业务的迅速发展，经营商品的种类繁多，所以资金、商品积压，周转缓慢，供求失调，调拨不当等现象更为普遍和严重。这是与当前国家建设与人民生活的需要完全不相容的，而根本解决这一矛盾的科学方法，便是严格实行经济核算制。
    经济核算制是经营管理企业的一种科学方法。国营贸易企业的经济核算制的具体内容，大体是：
    （一）建立合理、健全的企业机构，使之在国家财经政策的原则下，实行企业化经营，有计划地积累国家资金。（二）经济核算的企业单位，应为各种计划的编制单位，并以负责完成与超过各种既定计划为奋斗目标。（三）应具有经核定为完成计划所必需的自有资金，包括固定资金与流动资金。（四）经济核算企业在其既定的计划范围内，有权与买方或卖方订立具体的供销合同，并对履行合同负有物质上的责任。（五）订立各种制度：如明确的责任制度，严格的检查制度，正确的定额制度等。（六）在上级批准的贷款计划内，有权向国家银行取得为完成计划所必需的贷款。（七）对工作人员在完成或超过计划时，给予适当奖励。以上这些都必须通过国家银行对资金监督、精确计算及有系统的检查来保证。
    在国营贸易系统中实施经济核算，首先要开展一个对经营管理方面的检查运动，通过深入的具体检查，计算损失来促使全体职工——首先是干部深刻认识到供给制思想在今天给与国家经济建设的损害，在此基础上展开合理化建议，以便使经济核算制逐步实施。（新华社）
