The workers of the "May 1st" Engineering Team of the Basic Construction Department of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, after promoting the advanced Soviet experience of multi-head shaft sinking cyclical operations and creating a new national record of 16.4 meters per day, again created a new record of 17.15 meters per day on November 9th.

Their experience is to glue nine bricks together with cement, lay a layer of slag for each layer of bricks, and accelerate the lifting of the hanging pan. This achievement exceeds the national prescribed target by 145 percent and the planned target by 143 percent. (CCP Jiaozuo Mining Committee Party Group Communication Group)

Brief Commentary on Economic Life
Rural Cadres Should Universally Study the Experience of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee in Leading the Production Increase Movement

The experience of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee of Heilongjiang Province in leading the production increase movement (see page 2 of this newspaper on October 18th) has aroused the attention of many rural work cadres in Heilongjiang Province and other regions. They have seriously studied this experience and used it as a weapon to examine and improve their own work. This is very necessary.

However, it must be pointed out that rural work cadres in many regions still do not pay enough attention to the experience of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading the production increase movement. They either think that although Zhaoyuan's experience is very good, it is only a local experience; or they think that Zhaoyuan's experience has nothing to learn from.

Of course, the technical experience promoted by the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee can only be applied to areas with extensive cultivation. However, the experience of the Zhaoyuan County Committee in specifically using the working method of "from the masses, to the masses" to summarize and promote advanced farming methods of peasants is of great use to rural work cadres in various regions. The lack of sensitivity to new things in the production and life of peasants, and the style of not being good at going deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, are still widespread among many rural cadres, which is the main reason why their work ability cannot be rapidly improved. Studying the leadership experience of Zhaoyuan County Committee is very beneficial for these comrades.

At present, all localities are summarizing the experience of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic production increase movement. In this summary work, if we can earnestly study the experience of Zhaoyuan County and use this experience to deeply examine our work, it will be of great benefit to improving and improving our work and to the large-scale production movement next year.

    焦作矿务局“五一”工程队
    创造砌井新纪录
    焦作矿务局基本建设处“五一”工程队职工，推广苏联多头砌井循环作业的先进经验，继创日进十六点四公尺的全国新纪录后，又于十一月九日创日进十七点一五的新纪录。
    他们的经验是把九块砖用洋灰黏在一起，砌一层打一层石渣，并把吊盘提升加速。这一成绩超过国家规定指标百分之一百四十五，计划指标百分之一百四十三。（中共焦作矿委会党团通讯组）经济生活简评农村干部应普遍学习中共肇源
    县委领导增产运动的经验
    中共黑龙江省肇源县委领导增产运动的经验（见本报十月十八日第二版），已引起黑龙江省及其他地区许多农村工作干部的重视。他们对这个经验进行了认真的学习，并把这个经验作为武器来检查和改进自己的工作。这是十分必要的。
    但是必须指出，许多地区的农村工作干部对中共肇源县委领导增产运动的经验还是重视不够的。他们或者认为肇源的经验虽然很好，但只不过是一个局部地区的经验；或者认为肇源的经验根本没有什么可学习的。
    当然，中共肇源县委推广的技术经验，只能适用于耕作粗放的地区。但是肇源县委具体运用从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法，总结和推广农民的先进耕作方法的经验，对于各个地区的农村工作干部，都是有巨大作用的。对农民生产、生活中的新鲜事物缺乏敏感，和不善于深入群众进行调查研究的作风，在许多农村干部中还普遍地存在着，这就是他们的工作能力不能迅速提高的主要原因。学习肇源县委的领导经验，对这些同志是非常有益的。
    目前各地正在总结互助合作运动和爱国丰产运动的经验。在这次总结工作中，如果能认真学习肇源县的经验，并运用这个经验来深入检查工作，这对提高和改进工作，以及对明年的大生产运动，都会有很大的好处。
