    China Grain Company Beijing Branch Should Immediately Abolish the Disguised "Body Search" System

    Certain leading cadres and management personnel of the warehouses under the China Grain Company Beijing Branch lack the idea of relying on the working class to run the people's enterprises well. This has resulted in the continued preservation of many old and unreasonable systems, which has seriously dampened the production enthusiasm of the working masses and created an extremely negative impact politically. For example, in response to the call for increased production and thrift, the loading and unloading workers of the Xibianmen Grain Warehouse automatically bring a package of waste paper with them when they enter the warehouse, so that they can immediately plug the holes when the grain bags are broken to avoid grain spillage. Instead of praising and rewarding the workers for their highly conscious spirit of cherishing state property, the leading cadres of the warehouse have guards check the workers' bags when they leave the warehouse. This incident has seriously dampened the workers' enthusiasm and made them extremely dissatisfied. For example, the loading and unloading workers of the Seventh Squad of the Third Team in the Xibianmen District felt very sad after being checked by the guards, and since then they have not dared to bring bags into the warehouse again.

    In addition, there is a common practice in various grain warehouses of prohibiting cart drivers from bringing grass baskets and tarpaulins into the warehouse. Sometimes, because the loading and unloading of carts takes too long (wasting work time), the mules cannot be fed. In case of rain, workers must also obtain permission from the warehouse to retrieve tarpaulins from outside the warehouse.

    According to the person in charge of the warehouse, they do this because there is a lot of grain and tarpaulins in the warehouse, and they are afraid that the workers will mix them up; in other words, the warehouse is guarding against the workers as if they were thieves. The workers have repeatedly requested the abolition of this system, but there has been no result.

    I believe that the above-mentioned method of managing enterprises by bureaucratic capitalism should not continue to exist in state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature. Such practices not only underestimate the consciousness of the workers after liberation but also insult the working class. On behalf of the workers, I protest against this and demand that the Beijing Grain Company immediately abolish this disguised "body search" system and educate management personnel to correct the wrong idea of not trusting and not relying on the working masses.

### 中国粮食公司北京市公司应即废除变相“搜腰”制度

    中国粮食公司北京市公司应即废除变相“搜腰”制度
    中国粮食公司北京市公司所属各仓库的某些领导干部和管理人员缺乏依靠工人阶级搞好人民企业的思想，致使许多旧的、不合理的制度依然被保存下来，严重打击了工人群众的生产积极性，并在政治上造成了极恶劣的影响。如西便门粮食仓库的装卸工人响应增产节约的号召，入库工作时都自动带着一包废纸，以便在搬运时粮包破了随时堵住窟窿，避免粮食撒漏。该仓库的领导干部对工人这种高度自觉地爱护国家资财的精神不但不加以表扬奖励，反而在工人出库时让警卫检查工人的书包。这件事已经严重打击了工人的积极性并使工人极端不满。如西便门区第三中队第七小队的装卸工人经警卫人员检查后，都感到非常伤心，从此再也不敢带书包进库了。
    此外，各粮食仓库还普遍存在着一种制度，就是禁止大车工人带草簸箩和苫布入库。有时因装卸大车的时间过长（窝工），骡子也不能喂料。如遇下雨，还要经过库方许可，工人才能到库外取苫布。
    据该库负责人谈，他们这样作是因为库里粮食和苫布很多，恐怕工人给混错了；也就是说，库方是把工人当小偷来防备的。工人曾屡次要求取消这个制度，但一直没有结果。
    我认为：上述这种官僚资本主义管理企业的方法，在社会主义性质的国营企业里是不应该继续存在的。这样的作法，不只是过低估计了解放后工人的觉悟性，而且是对工人阶级的侮辱。我代表工人对此提出抗议，并要求北京市粮食公司立即废除这种变相的“搜腰”制度，教育管理人员纠正不相信和不依靠工人群众的错误思想。
