    At the UN General Assembly Plenary Session on December 21st
    Gromyko's Speech on the Massacre of Korean and Chinese Prisoners of War by US Authorities

Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates:

    As you are aware, the Soviet delegation yesterday addressed a letter to Mr. Pearson, President of the UN General Assembly, pointing out the necessity of including the pressing and important issue of "the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by the American military authorities" on the agenda of the Seventh Session of the UN General Assembly.

    The issue raised by the Soviet delegation is pressing and important in its nature and international significance and requires immediate discussion before the adjournment of this session of the Assembly.

    What are the reasons for the Soviet Union raising this issue in the Assembly?

    This is prompted by new crimes committed by the American military authorities against the Koreans and Chinese detained in the prisoner-of-war camp on Pongam Island. It is now widely known, particularly from reports by the Associated Press and Reuters, that the American military authorities in Korea committed a new and unprecedentedly terrible crime against the aforementioned Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island on December 14, 1952.

    American guards at the prisoner-of-war camp killed eighty-two Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and wounded one hundred and twenty Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    Those subjected to bloody persecution were prisoners of war who demanded repatriation. These new atrocities against prisoners of war surpass in their horror all the crimes previously committed by American executioners against prisoners of war, especially those on Koje Island.

    According to newspaper reports, a representative of the US military command in Korea was forced to admit that the Pongam Island prisoner-of-war camp incident was the most serious and terrible of all incidents that had occurred in UN prisoner-of-war camps, judging from its consequences.

    The Soviet delegation, during the discussion of the Korean issue, requested the Assembly to pay attention to the atrocities committed by the American army, which has embarked on the path of cold-blooded murder, on Pongam Island, and the barbarous persecutions they inflicted on prisoners of war in the Koje, Jeju, and Busan prisoner-of-war camps. These crimes, by their nature, constitute a planned massacre by the US military command in Korea of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in American prisoner-of-war camps. Representatives of the US military command do not deny the new bloody crimes committed by the invaders. For example, an Associated Press reporter reported from Busan that after a so-called "investigation" into the massacre of eighty-two prisoners of war and the wounding of one hundred and twenty prisoners of war, US Colonel Caldwell praised Lieutenant Colonel Miller, the commander of the Pongam Island prisoner-of-war camp, for taking resolute action.

    Why are these bloody persecutions, whose barbarity and cruelty far exceed Hitler's crimes, carried out against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war?

    The reason is that the prisoners of war demand repatriation. They do not wish to become victims of violence and terror in American prisoner-of-war camps. The American military authorities in Korea want to use these means of violence and terror to force the prisoners of war to betray their motherland and be driven by the American authorities. Even the discontinuous reports published in world newspapers regarding the bloody events at the Pongam Island prisoner-of-war camp illustrate that the reason why American aggressors are inflicting terror strikes against prisoners of war in Korea is solely because these heroic sons of the Korean and Chinese people are unwilling to sell out their motherland, their military honor, their patriotic duty, and their people. Is it not sufficient proof of the fortitude and bravery of these Korean and Chinese patriots that these Korean and Chinese patriots, serenely facing death under the bloody hands of American butchers on Pongam Island, were still singing patriotic songs of their own countries, further infuriating the organizers and executors of this collective massacre?

    These new crimes by the American military authorities in Korea demonstrate that the American ruling clique continues to flagrantly violate the basic principles of international law with their criminal attitude towards civilians and prisoners of war. If new facts are needed to further expose the plans of the American ruling clique, which is waging a war of aggression and plunder against the Korean people in Korea, then these new crimes by the American executioners are such new facts.

    Mr. Jessup, the US representative attending the General Committee, said today during the discussion of the Soviet proposal that the prisoners in the Pongam Island prisoner-of-war camp, where the American military authorities committed barbarous atrocities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, were civilians rather than prisoners of war.

    Even if that were the case, could it be said that there is any justification for carrying out a collective massacre of unarmed people in a prisoner-of-war camp? Could there be even the slightest excuse?

    But in reality, the assertion that these people are civilians is nothing more than a distortion of the truth. It is none other than the American journalists who refute this falsehood. For example, an Associated Press reporter reported from Busan that those detained on Pongam Island have been classified as soldiers since the day they were captured. The reporter pointed out that during interrogation, the prisoners of war replied that "when an agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war is finally reached," they would return home. Therefore, the US military command later forcibly reclassified these prisoners of war as civilians.

    In this light, what value can be placed on the assertion repeatedly made by representatives of the US government, including those speaking at the UN General Assembly, that the work of repatriating prisoners of war has been hampered because many prisoners of war refuse to return home? Now, anyone who does not deliberately close their eyes to the facts will see that the American representatives' claim that prisoners of war refuse repatriation is entirely a deceptive tale.

    This is deceiving their own people and deceiving world opinion. The intention of this deception is to conceal the series of planned crimes committed by the US military against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and to conceal the true aggressive aims that the Wall Street industrial and commercial tycoons want to achieve through their war of aggression against the Korean people.

    However, this policy of the American ruling clique, the crimes of the US military in Korea, especially the unprecedented and inhumane crimes committed by the US military against prisoners of war on Pongam Island, can absolutely not be concealed by any hypocritical remarks from representatives of the US government. At the same time, this can absolutely not be concealed by any false resolutions, such as the resolution recently passed after the discussion of the Korean issue.

    Everyone knows that in the past, the American military authorities in Korea also committed various crimes against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The Soviet delegation repeatedly urged the Assembly to pay attention to this fact during the discussion of the Korean issue. The Soviet delegation urged the Assembly to pay attention to the atrocities of bloody suppression against prisoners of war in the Koje Island, Jeju Island, and Busan prisoner-of-war camps, and listed many facts to show that the American representatives were completely pretending when they were boasting about the US government's adherence to the principles of "humanitarianism," "individual freedom," and so on in the prisoner-of-war issue.

    All these facts have not been refuted by anyone. On the contrary, reports from American and British news agencies, assurances from former prisoner-of-war camp commanders Brigadier General Colson and Brigadier General Dodd, testimonies from Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who fortunately escaped the death camps, and reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would never be mistaken for sympathizing with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, all confirmed these facts.

    This has been confirmed by a report from Canadian war correspondent William Stevenson, who visited these prisoner-of-war camps. This report was published in the "Star Weekly." The American representatives, other flatterers of American foreign policy, and partners who are carrying out the war of aggression against the Korean people with the United States deliberately did not mention this report.

    The bloody events on Koje Island, which everyone knows, are the most illustrative of the rule in American prisoner-of-war camps. The aforementioned report from the International Committee of the Red Cross includes a statement issued by its representatives, according to which these representatives directly understood the truth of the matter. The report stated: At approximately four o'clock in the morning on February 18, a group of fully armed soldiers, without giving any warning, entered the camp. At that time, almost all the prisoners of war were asleep, except for those confined in a tent. The army surrounded other tents, including the tents where the prisoners of war representatives who had not yet been able to contact the prisoner-of-war camp authorities lived.

    The prisoners of war were forced to remain in their tents under the threat of bayonets. One or two of them did not know what was happening at the time, ran out of the tents, and were shot. The prisoners of war panicked, believing that they would all be killed, and tried to run out of the tents to defend themselves and find out what was going on. The army immediately opened fire on them.

    At dawn, the prisoners of war's representatives again tried to negotiate with the army commander, but were unsuccessful. The representative also tried to calm the prisoners of war, but was also unsuccessful. One of his comrades, the leader of the Third Prisoner-of-War Camp, assisted him in trying to contact the commander, but he was shot and killed.

    At this time, it was approximately eight o'clock, and Colonel Fitzgerald arrived at the scene. In his presence, several singing prisoners of war were shot.

    Although Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky emphasized the need to distribute this report from the International Committee of the Red Cross to the delegations of various countries at the Seventh Session of the UN General Assembly, and repeatedly made such requests, this report has not yet been distributed to the representatives. If this report were not published in the April issue of the Geneva "International Red Cross Review" magazine, then people would never know about it.

    Some people are carefully preventing delegations and public opinion from accessing this document.

    An Associated Press report from Geneva on December 16 is very interesting. This report pointed out that the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report stating that the actions of the United Nations Command in Korea showed that the Command violated the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war.

    The report went on to say that after describing these events, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that shooting prisoners of war violates Article 42 of the 1949 Geneva Convention.

    Let me remind the representatives that Article 42 of the Geneva Convention states that the use of weapons against prisoners of war, especially those who have escaped or attempted to escape, should be a last resort, and should always be preceded by a warning appropriate to the circumstances.

    Other bloody crimes of persecuting Korean and Chinese prisoners of war occurred on Koje Island. The aforementioned General Colson admitted that many bloody incidents had occurred in the prisoner-of-war camp, and many prisoners of war were killed or wounded in these incidents. After admitting this, General Colson said that he would do everything possible to prevent atrocities and bloodshed from happening again in the future, and guaranteed that the prisoners of war in that prisoner-of-war camp would receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law in the future.

    This compelled admission also proves that the US military command used criminal means of terror in the prisoner-of-war camp against those prisoners of war who righteously protested these crimes of the American armed forces.

    The document named "Our Lives are in Danger, Help Us Escape This American Hell Quickly"—the famous appeal letter from the captured officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army on Koje Island—reported the following facts.

    On May 19, 1952, the authorities of Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 66 announced that all prisoners of war who wanted to return to North Korea must line up in front of their barracks before 7:00 p.m. to prepare to board the ship. Without exception, we all hoped to return to our hometown. After we lined up, the American soldiers actually used machine guns and flamethrowers to sweep us and directed tanks to attack us. One hundred and twenty-seven of our comrades died on the spot, and many were injured.

    But the American military butchers were not reconciled. They decided to continue their criminal acts to destroy the will and spirit of the loyal sons of the Korean and Chinese people captured by the United States.

    The aforementioned document pointed out that the American guards carried out bloody massacres in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 602 and Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 72 on May 22 and 23. Eighty-eight of our comrades were killed with machine guns and grenades, and thirty-nine were injured.

    On May 23, eighteen prisoners of war were killed in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 16.

    This letter from Koje Island was signed by 6,223 prisoners of war.

    Reports in newspapers around the world, including American newspapers, talked about other shootings on Jeju Island. On October 1, fifty-two prisoners of war on this island were killed by two rows of American soldiers who were specially transferred from other places to persecute prisoners of war, and another one hundred and eleven
    three prisoners of war were injured.

    According to the Associated Press, on October 24, when the UN General Assembly was already in session, nine prisoners of war were injured in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 2 in Busan.

    This kind of persecution of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has been going on while the Seventh Session of the UN General Assembly has been in session. According to reports from American and British news agencies, from October 14 to December 4, 1952, three hundred and twenty-one Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were killed or injured. This is according to news from Americans in Korea. Everyone can easily imagine how large the number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war actually killed by American devils is. We say that the "voluntary repatriation" hypocritically spoken of by the Wall Street tycoons and their echoes is actually the Koje Island and Pongam Island incidents. It is actually using violence against prisoners of war to make them fight against their country and people. In view of these facts that prove that the US military command is planning to kill Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, can anyone still doubt the above words?

    "Voluntary repatriation" is used to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and continue the Korean War. Only the blind or those who deliberately distort the facts will fail to see this. Those who distort the facts are trying to conceal the unprecedented crimes of those who planned and executed the torture and collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in American death camps—which all good people now correctly call American prisoner-of-war camps. American Secretary of State Acheson and other American representatives attending the Seventh Session of the UN General Assembly talked a lot about their legal and moral and humanitarian principles. However, in reality, they are forcing the Assembly to accept their proposals that they are instructed to make, which want to make the Assembly approve the illegal detention of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war by the US military command.

    No matter how desperately the shameless Americans who advocate a humane attitude towards prisoners of war try to deceive world opinion, the facts will eventually expose them. Here are some facts. According to a statement published by the Korean Central News Agency some time ago, on July 15, 1951, one hundred prisoners of war were killed by machine guns in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 62. According to documents later discovered, the purpose of killing them was to train machine gunners to shoot at moving targets; on February 18, 1952, another three hundred prisoners of war were shot in the same way in the same prisoner-of-war camp; on March 13, April 17, and April 20, a total of one hundred and seventy prisoners of war were brutally killed. Documents prove that on May 10, 1952, four prisoners of war in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 76 were hanged because they expressed their willingness to go home. On May 1, the devils gouged out the eyes of eighteen prisoners of war. On May 18, thirteen soldiers of the Korean People's Army were drowned and dismembered. When the other prisoners of war in this prisoner-of-war camp began to protest, a guard officer pulled out fifty people and used them as targets for testing new grenades on the same day. As a result, four prisoners of war were killed on the spot, and the remaining forty-six were injured and died soon after due to their injuries.

    On May 27, the invaders also committed the same terrible atrocities in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 77. Documents say that a large group of prisoners of war who demanded repatriation were used as objects for testing new flamethrowers.

    On May 20 and 30, a total of thirty-seven prisoners of war were killed and sixteen were injured in the same prisoner-of-war camp.

    In the course of debating the Korean question, particularly in the question of prisoners of war, American representatives distorted the facts, trying to make us believe that the American government’s policy on this matter did not violate international law and the aforementioned Geneva Convention. In addition, they also said such nonsensical things as: most prisoners of war do not want to go home. However, in the course of the debate, it became clear that the purpose of American sophistry was to illustrate that it was impossible to repatriate all prisoners of war, and that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war did not want to go home. This set of sophistry is nothing more than to cover up its policy of persecution and terror against the Korean and Chinese patriotic fighters; these Korean and Chinese patriotic fighters expressed their legitimate desire to go home, and expressed the same legitimate anger at the atrocities of the American executioners. This massacre of prisoners of war by the American military authorities in Korea on Pongam Island was precisely because the prisoners of war expressed this legitimate desire for repatriation.

    Indeed, there is no doubt that the resolutions recently passed by the UN General Assembly under American pressure as usual are what the American ruling clique needs. The American ruling clique is unwilling to end the bloodshed in Korea. The Korean War has caused millions of casualties on both sides, not to mention the huge material losses caused to the Korean people by this American-launched war of aggression.

    If a person does not deliberately close their eyes and not look at the facts, then of course there is nothing to doubt about this. These facts reveal to the world the aggressive nature of the policy adopted by the United States on the Korean question. This aggressiveness was not only fully exposed when discussing the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union during the debate on the Korean question, specifically, when discussing the Soviet proposal to immediately cease fire in Korea, which was not adopted due to the obstruction of the United States and countries that were accomplices in the aggression against Korea, but it is also exposed in the issue currently being discussed of the massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by the American military authorities. In this respect, the most illustrative thing is the speech made by the American representative in the General Committee.

    The Soviet delegation immediately called attention to the fact that the aforementioned proposal adopted by the General Assembly was exactly what the American ruling clique, which was unwilling to end the bloodshed in Korea, wanted. Despite the attempts by representatives of the American and British groups to prove that the facts were the opposite, the proposal fully met their requirements, because it did not include anything that could promote an immediate cessation of the bloodshed in Korea at all—it was intended to continue the war from the very beginning, and it doomed all efforts to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue to failure. This is understandable, because in this proposal, the whole problem boils down to the fact that the warring parties in Korea only exchange those prisoners of war who "voluntarily" return to their own country, and the remaining prisoners of war, according to this proposal, must be left to the disposal of the Repatriation Commission, which means left to the disposal of the Americans.

    But everyone knows that the arbitrator on the Repatriation Commission is the United Nations, and the United Nations is one of the warring parties. Needless to say, asking the United Nations to act as an arbitrator to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue is unprecedented, unfair, and absolutely inadmissible. From this, it can be seen that the adopted proposal does not really intend to achieve a ceasefire in Korea, nor does it intend to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue in accordance with the principles of international law, the Geneva Convention, and basic international norms.

    It is necessary to say this now, because some people consciously or unconsciously have tried to make this proposal seem as if it can really serve as a basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue, and even the entire Korean issue. Now that the UN General Assembly has received replies from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, both of which correctly pointed out the illegal nature of this resolution imposed on the UN General Assembly by the United States, everyone can see clearly that this resolution has not been and cannot be the basis for resolving this issue, because its purpose is the opposite, and at the same time, it wants to deceive public opinion. Is it a coincidence that the United States massacred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island immediately after the passage of this proposal? Of course not.

    Distinguished Delegates, can the UN General Assembly turn a blind eye to the crimes committed by the American military authorities in Korea against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war? If it truly cherishes its prestige, it absolutely cannot do so. It absolutely cannot tolerate such acts of trampling on humanitarian and moral principles, and cannot tolerate such flagrant violations of the recognized principles of international law regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. The Assembly has a responsibility to take urgent and appropriate measures to stop the criminal acts being carried out by the American military authorities in Korea for the purpose of systematically killing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    In this situation, it is absolutely necessary for the Assembly to immediately deal with the issue raised by the Soviet delegation regarding "the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by the American military authorities" and the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on this issue before the adjournment and to make appropriate decisions.

    The Assembly has even more responsibility to take action against this crime of massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, because the US military command committed this crime under the cover of the flag of the United Nations.

    The Soviet delegation hereby submits the following proposal to the Assembly: "In view of the following new facts: On December 14, 1952, the American military authorities massacred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island, resulting in eighty-two Korean and Chinese prisoners of war being killed and one hundred and twenty injured,

    "In view of the fact that this collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in American prisoner-of-war camps has the nature of a planned massacre of prisoners of war—which has been proven by the many atrocities committed by the American military authorities against prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camps on Koje Island, Jeju Island, Pongam Island, Busan and other places,

    The UN General Assembly specifically condemns these crimes of the American military authorities in Korea, which trampled on the basic principles of humanity and human morality and flagrantly violated the recognized norms of international law regarding the treatment of prisoners of war,

    Strongly demands that the US government take swift measures to end the crimes committed by the American military authorities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and severely punish those who committed these crimes."

    We hope that this proposal will be supported by other delegations, and we hope that the Assembly will have enough strength to stop the atrocities and killings committed by the American military authorities in Korea—the planned collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Korean American prisoner-of-war camps. At the same time, the Soviet delegation urges the UN General Assembly to pay attention to the fact that those countries that do not have enough courage to uphold this just demand will also bear serious responsibility for this.

### 在联合国大会全体会议十二月二十一日会议上  葛罗米柯关于美国当局屠杀朝鲜与中国战俘问题的演说

专栏：

    在联合国大会全体会议十二月二十一日会议上
    葛罗米柯关于美国当局屠杀朝鲜与中国战俘问题的演说主席先生，诸位代表先生：
    诸位已经知道，苏联代表团昨天曾致函联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生，指出有必要把迫切而重要的“关于美国军事当局集体屠杀蜂岩岛的朝鲜与中国战俘”问题列入联合国第七届大会议程。
    苏联代表团所提出的问题，从它的性质与国际意义上来看，是迫切而重要的，而且需要在本届大会休会以前立即加以讨论。
    苏联在大会上提出这个问题的理由何在呢？
    这是由于美国军事当局对拘留在蜂岩岛战俘营的朝鲜人和中国人干出新的罪行而促成的。现在大家都知道：特别是从美联社和路透社的消息里知道：朝鲜的美国军事当局于一九五二年十二月十四日对上述蜂岩岛上的朝中战俘犯了新的、空前可怕的罪行。
    该战俘营的美国卫兵杀害了八十二名朝中战俘，打伤了一百二十名朝中战俘。
    受到血腥迫害的都是要求遣返的战俘。这些迫害战俘的新暴行，其可怕的程度超过了美国刽子手以前对战俘，特别是在巨济岛上对战俘干出来的一切罪行。
    据报纸消息说，朝鲜美军司令部的一个代表曾被迫承认，蜂岩岛战俘营的事件从它的后果来看是联合国战俘营发生的一切事件中最严重、最可怕的一次。
    苏联代表团曾经在讨论朝鲜问题的时候要求大会注意已经走上杀人不眨眼的强盗道路的美国军队在蜂岩岛上的暴行，和他们对巨济、济州和釜山战俘营的战俘进行的野蛮迫害。这些罪行就其性质而言是朝鲜美军司令部有计划地屠杀美国战俘营里的朝中战俘的行为。美军司令部的代表并不否认侵略者干出来新的血腥罪行。例如，美联社一个记者自釜山报道：在对屠杀八十二名、打伤一百二十名战俘的事件进行所谓“调查”以后，美国的卡德微尔上校夸奖蜂岩岛战俘营长官米勒中校采取了坚决行动。
    他们为什么要对朝中战俘进行这种其野蛮性与暴虐性远远超过希特勒的罪行的血腥迫害呢？
    原因就是战俘要求遣返。他们不愿在美国战俘营里成为暴力与恐怖的牺牲者。朝鲜美国军事当局想用这些暴力与恐怖手段迫使战俘们背叛他们的祖国，供美国当局驱使。就连世界报纸所发表的关于蜂岩岛战俘营血腥事件的不连续的报道也说明了：美国侵略者所以要在朝鲜对战俘施行恐怖的打击，仅仅是因为这些朝鲜与中国人民的英雄儿子不愿出卖他们的祖国，他们的军人荣誉，他们的爱国职责和他们的人民。这些朝鲜与中国的爱国者，在蜂岩岛美国屠夫血手下从容就义的时候，还唱着本国的爱国主义的歌曲，使得这次集体屠杀的组织者与执行者更加暴跳如雷，难道这还不足以证明这些朝鲜与中国爱国者的刚强英勇么？
    朝鲜美国军事当局的这些新罪行说明了美国统治集团继续用他们对待平民的罪恶态度和对待战俘的罪恶态度悍然破坏国际法的基本原则。假如还需要新的事实来再一次揭露对朝鲜人民进行侵略掠夺战争的美国统治集团在朝鲜的计划的话，那么，美国刽子手的这些新罪行就是这样的新事实。
    美国出席总务委员会的代表杰塞普今日在讨论苏联提案时说：在美国军事当局对朝鲜与中国战俘干出野蛮暴行的蜂岩岛战俘营中，拘留的是平民而不是战俘。
    即使情况是这样的，难道就能说对战俘营里面手无寸铁的人民进行集体屠杀是有理由的吗？难道就能多多少少有一点口实吗？
    但在实际上，所谓这些人是平民这句话，不过是一种颠倒黑白的说法。足以驳斥这种假话的不是别人而恰恰是美国的新闻记者。例如美联社一个记者自釜山报道说：被关在蜂岩岛的人，从被俘那天起就被列为军人一类。那个记者指出，在询问期间，战俘们回答说：“在最后达成交换战俘的协议的时候”，他们就要回家。因此，美军司令部后来就硬把这些战俘重新列为平民了。
    这样看来，美国政府的代表，包括在联合国大会上发言的代表在内，所口口声声说的遣返战俘工作由于许多战俘拒绝回国而受到阻挠这种说法，还有什么价值可言呢？现在不论什么人，只要他不是故意闭起眼睛不看事实，就不会看不到美国代表所谓战俘拒绝遣返的说法，全是一套欺人之谈。
    这是在欺骗他们的本国人民，欺骗全世界的舆论，这种欺骗的用意是掩饰美军对朝中战俘有计划进行的一系列罪行，掩饰华尔街工商业巨头想要通过他们对朝鲜人民发动的侵略战争所要达到的真正的侵略目的。
    但是，美国统治集团的这种政策，美军在朝鲜的罪行，特别是美军对蜂岩岛的战俘所进行的史无前例的惨无人道的罪行，绝对不是美国政府代表的任何虚伪的言论所能掩饰得了的。同时，这也绝对不是任何虚伪的决议，例如最近讨论朝鲜问题之后所通过的决议，所能掩饰得了的。
    人人都知道，在前些时候，美国在朝鲜的军事当局也曾对朝中战俘犯下各种罪行。苏联代表团在讨论朝鲜问题期间曾再三促使大会注意这种事实。苏联代表团促使大会注意巨济岛、济州岛和釜山战俘营对战俘进行的血腥镇压的暴行，列举了许多事实，说明美国代表在大吹美国政府在战俘问题上遵循“人道主义”“个人自由”等原则的时候，完全是在装模作样。
    所有这些事实都没有受到任何人的反驳。相反的，美国和英国通讯社的报道、前战俘营长官柯尔生准将和杜德准将的保证、幸而逃出死亡营的朝中战俘的作证以及绝不会被人误认为同情朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字国际委员会的报告，都证实了这些事实。
    这一点已经由曾经访问这些战俘营的加拿大战地记者威廉·史蒂文森的报道加以证实。这个报道发表在“明星周报”上。而美国代表、其他谄媚美国外交政策的人及与美国一起对朝鲜人民进行侵略战争的伙伴们都故意不谈这个报道。
    大家知道的巨济岛血腥事件最足以说明美国战俘营统治的情况。上述的红十字国际委员会报告中包括了它的代表发表的声明，据报告中指出，这些代表是直接了解事实真相的。报告这样说：二月十八日上午四时左右，约有全副武装的军队一团，未经提出任何警告，即进入营场。当时除了那些被禁闭在一个帐篷中的战俘以外，几乎所有战俘都已熟睡。军队包围了其他帐篷，包括尚未能与战俘营当局取得联系的战俘代表所住的帐篷在内。
    战俘在刺刀的威胁下，被迫留在他们的帐篷中。其中有一两人不知道当时发生的事情，跑出帐篷，就遭到了射击。战俘们着慌了，他们认为他们将全体被杀，就试图跑出帐篷，进行自卫，并了解一下到底是什么一回事情。军队当即向他们开枪。
    天亮时，战俘的代表再次试图与军队指挥官谈判，但未能成功。这个代表也曾试图使战俘们安静下来，但也未能成功。他的一个同志、第三战俘营的领袖协助他设法与指挥官取得联系，可是他被击毙了。
    这时候大约是八点钟，费兹吉拉德上校就在这时候来到出事现场。当着他的面，又有几个唱歌的战俘被枪击。
    尽管苏联外交部部长维辛斯基强调必须把红十字国际委员会的这个报告在联合国第七届大会上分发给各国代表团，并一再提出这样的要求，但是这个报告迄未分发给代表们。如果日内瓦“国际红十字评论”杂志四月号上不刊载这个报告，那么人们就将永远不会知道它。
    某些人正在小心地防止代表团与舆论界接触到这个文件。
    美联社在十二月十六日从日内瓦发出的一个报道很有趣。这个报道指出，红十字国际委员会刊载了一个报告，报告中说，在朝鲜的联合国军司令部的行动显示这个司令部违反了关于战俘的日内瓦公约。
    这个报道接着说，红十字国际委员会描述了这些事件后说，射击战俘是违反一九四九年日内瓦公约第四十二条的。
    让我来提醒代表们一下吧，日内瓦公约的第四十二条说，对战俘，尤其对脱逃或企图脱逃之战俘，使用武器，应属最后之手段，并应每次先予以适合于当时情况之警告。
    其他迫害朝中战俘的血腥罪行是在巨济岛发生的。上述柯尔生将军承认在战俘营中曾发生许多次流血事件，许多战俘在这些事件中被杀死或打伤了。柯尔生将军在承认了这一点以后又说，他将竭尽全力防止将来再发生暴行和流血事件，并保证那个战俘营的战俘将来能够得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇。
    这种迫不得已的承认也证明：美军司令部在战俘营内对于那些正义地抗议美国武装部队的这些罪行的战俘，使用了罪恶的恐怖手段。
    名叫“我们的生命处在险境中，帮助我们快快逃出这座美国地狱”的文件——有名的巨济岛人民军被俘官兵的呼吁信——报告了下面的事实。
    一九五二年五月十九日，六十六号战俘营当局宣布说，所有想回北朝鲜的战俘必须在晚上七点钟以前在他们的营房前面排好队，作好乘船准备。没有一个人例外，我们全都希望回到故乡。当我们排好队以后，美国兵竟用机关枪和火焰喷射器向我们扫射起来，并指挥坦克来攻击我们。我们的同志当场死了一百二十七人，并有许多负伤。
    但是美国军方的屠夫还不甘心。他们决定继续他们的罪恶行为以摧毁被美国俘掳的朝鲜与中国人民的忠实的儿子的意志和精神。
    上述文件指出，美国警备兵于五月二十二日和二十三日在六百零二号战俘营和七十二号战俘营内进行了血腥的杀戮。我们的同志被用机关枪和手榴弹杀死了八十八人，有三十九人受伤。
    五月二十三日，在第十六号战俘营又有十八个战俘被杀害。
    这封来自巨济岛的信是由六千二百二十三名战俘署名的。
    世界各地报纸的报道，包括美国报纸的报道在内，谈到了济州岛上另外一些枪杀事件，十月一日，在这个岛上有五十二名战俘被专为迫害战俘而从别处调来的两排美国兵杀害了，另外有一百一十
    三个战俘受伤。
    据美联社消息，十月二十四日，当联合国大会已经开会的时候，釜山二号战俘营有九名战俘受伤。
    在联合国第七届大会开会的时候，对朝中战俘的
    这种迫害一直在进行着。根据美英通讯社的报道，从一九五二年十月十四日到十二月四日，朝中战俘被杀死或打伤的有三百二十一人。这是根据朝鲜境内美国人士的消息。大家能够很容易地想像到朝中战俘被美国魔鬼杀害的人数实际上是多么庞大。我们说华尔街大亨和他们的应声虫所伪善地说的“自愿遣返”实际上就是巨济岛和蜂岩岛事件，实际上就是以暴力对付战俘，使他们对他们的国家和人民作战，鉴于这些证明美军司令部有计划地杀害朝中战俘的事实，还能有任何人怀疑上面的话吗？
    “自愿遣返”是用来阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决和继续朝鲜战争的。只有瞎子或者那些故意歪曲事实的人才会看不出这一点。歪曲事实的人是为了要掩饰那些计划和执行拷打和集体屠杀美国死亡营——现在一切善良的人民都正确地称美国战俘营为死亡营——内的朝中战俘的人的史无前例的罪行。
    大家知道，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经一再对这一切屠杀朝中战俘的集体迫害和暴行提出抗议。就在今天，中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来还向联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生提出一项反对屠杀蜂岩岛战俘罪行的强烈抗议。联合国大会是不能漠视这个抗议的。我不妨再说一下：周恩来外交部长是代表中华人民共和国发言的，虽然中华人民共和国的代表团并没有在此间和我们一齐出席联合国大会，但是你们大家都知道得很清楚，中华人民共和国的代表却在无形中以一个大国和大民族的身分参加了这个大会。
    美国军事当局在朝鲜的罪行并不是偶然的。这种罪行是美国统治集团在朝鲜问题上所采取的政策的结果，美国统治集团的政策的目的是要拖延对朝鲜人民进行的侵略战争，是要扩大对朝鲜和中国的侵略，这一点在联合国大会本届会议辩论朝鲜问题的时候已经再度证明了。苏联代表团在刚开始讨论这个问题时便提请大家注意这个问题的重要性和迫切性，并请求大家注意联合国大会有必要采取一切实际可行的、目的在于结束流血和解决朝鲜问题的步骤。
    在辩论联合国大会议程程序时，我们曾要求大家注意这个问题，并坚决主张第一委员会必须优先讨论波兰提出的要求立即停止在朝鲜的陆、海、空敌对行动的建议和解决朝鲜问题的建议。大家还记得，在美国政府的压力之下，我们的提案没有通过。
    这个提案没有通过并不是一件偶然的事情。因为在所谓联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会辩论朝鲜问题时，就可以明显地看出，美国在当时已再度坚决地采取了阻止停止朝鲜敌对行动的方针。
    在讨论苏联提案时，也可以很明显地看出这一点。苏联提案说，必须邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论朝鲜问题。这个提案也受到美国政府的猛烈反对。而同时，在美国政府压力之下，却邀请了李承晚傀儡政权分子参加讨论朝鲜问题。他们的发言说明李承晚分子不仅不想结束朝鲜战争，相反的，他们还公开说他们的目的是要继续朝鲜战争并夺取北朝鲜。
    当时，美国国务卿艾奇逊说，美国政府绝对反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表参加讨论朝鲜问题。每个人都看得很清楚，有这样的代表参加，就可以更深入地和更详尽地讨论这个问题并找出一个正确的解决办法，就可以使朝鲜人民的真正代表得以从联合国的讲坛上发出他们正义的愤怒之声，以反对朝鲜领土上的干涉军队每天对朝鲜平民及落在美国军队手里的朝中战俘所进行的罪行。
    目的在拖延朝鲜战争的美国政府的立场，在辩论遣返战俘问题时，已经完全被揭露出来了。苏联代表团举出事实说明美国统治集团没有设法解决这个问题的意图，他们仍然继续进行武力扣留战俘的老政策；虽然我们过去曾再三说过，这个政策是违反国际法的基本和普遍公认的原则的。
    苏联外交部长维辛斯基在第一委员会的演说，说明了美国政府的这个政策显然是违反规定遣返全部战俘的一九四九年日内瓦公约的。
    大家都知道：经过悠久的时代考验的人道主义原则、亘古以来就为文明人类所遵守的原则体现在日内瓦公约及其他许多国际文件之中。但是，美国政府正在蹂躏这些国际法原则和国际惯例，蔑视日内瓦公约的道义和政治责任。
    每一个人都知道，在签订停战协定以后立即把全部战俘遣送回家是久已成立的国际法基本准则之一，这些准则曾在一九四九年关于战俘的日内瓦公约中予以重申。然而，美国统治集团把这个有着美国签字的国际协定看作一张废纸。华盛顿的政客们决定以武力扣留战俘，并且为了欺骗世界舆论和他们本国人民，发出了所谓“自愿遣返”的叫嚣。所有关于“自愿遣返”、“不得强迫遣返”、“非武力的遣返”的鬼话事实上都只是强迫扣留战俘的阴谋的花样，这个阴谋彰明昭著地违反了国际法和美国的庄严义务。世界看到这种伪善面孔已经好久了。那些装出一付战俘的保护者面孔的人其实就是那些下令在巨济岛、釜山、济州岛及其他美国死亡营酷刑室内拷打和屠杀成千上万朝中战俘的人。美国国务卿艾奇逊及其他出席联合国第七届大会的美国代表大谈其法律与道德及人道原则。然而，实际上他们却在强使大会接受他们授意的要想使大会批准美军司令部非法拘留成千上万战俘的提案。
    不管鼓吹以人道态度对待战俘的无耻的美国人怎样拚命欺骗世界舆论，事实终于揭露了他们。下面是一些事实。据朝鲜中央通讯社前些日子发表的声明说，一九五一年七月十五日，第六十二号战俘营内有一百名战俘被用机关枪打死。据后来发现的文件说，杀害他们的目的是想训练机枪手射击活动目标；一九五二年二月十八日，在同一战俘营里又有三百名战俘被用同样的方法所枪杀；在三月十三日、四月十七日和二十日，总共有一百七十名战俘被野蛮地杀害。文件证明，一九五二年五月十日，第七十六号战俘营里有四个战俘因为表示愿意回家而被绞死。五月一日，魔鬼们把十八名战俘的眼睛挖了出来。五月十八日，十三名朝鲜人民军的战士被溺毙，被肢解。当这个战俘营的其他战俘开始抗议的时候，一个警卫队军官拉出去五十个人，同一天把他们当作试验新式手榴弹的目标，结果，四名战俘当场被炸死，其余四十六人受伤，不久就因伤重而死去。
    五月二十七日，侵略者也在第七十七号战俘营里干出来同样可怕的暴行。文件说，一大群要求遣返的战俘被当作了试验新式喷火器的对象。
    五月二十日和三十日，在同一战俘营内被杀害的战俘共有三十七人，受伤的有十六人。
    在辩论朝鲜问题的过程中，特别在战俘问题上，美国代表们歪曲事实，试图叫我们相信，美国政府在这件事情上的政策并没有违反国际法和上述的日内瓦公约。此外，他们还说这样无聊的话，即：大部分战俘都不愿意回家。但是，在辩论的过程中，可以明显地看出，美国诡辩的目的在于说明：要遣返全部战俘是不可能的，朝鲜和中国战俘都不愿意回家。这一套诡辩无非要掩盖它对朝中爱国志士所实行的迫害与恐怖政策；这些朝中爱国志士表示了要回家的合法愿望，对美国刽子手们的暴行表示了同样合法的愤怒。朝鲜美军当局这次在蜂岩岛上对战俘施行大屠杀，正是因为战俘们表示了这种要求遣返的合法愿望。
    的确毫无疑问，联合国大会最近在美国压力下照例通过的提案是美国统治集团所需要的，美国统治集团不愿意终止朝鲜的流血，朝鲜战争已给双方造成了成百万人的伤亡，更不必说这个美国发动的侵略战争给朝鲜人民所造成的浩大的物质损失了。
    假如一个人不是故意闭上他的眼睛不看事实，那么，当然这是没有什么可怀疑的。这些事实向全世界揭露了美国在朝鲜问题上所采政策的侵略性。这种侵略性不仅在讨论苏联在辩论朝鲜问题期间所提出的提案时，具体地说，在讨论那个由于美国与侵略朝鲜的帮凶国家的阻挠而未被通过的主张在朝鲜立刻停火的苏联提案时，暴露无遗，就是在目前所讨论的美军当局屠杀蜂岩岛朝中战俘的问题时也暴露无遗。在这一方面，最能说明问题的是美国代表在总务委员会的发言。
    苏联代表团当即要求注意下述事实：大会所通过的上述提案，正是不愿结束朝鲜流血事件的美国统治集团所希望的。尽管美英集团的代表试图证明事实与此相反，该提案是完全符合他们的要求的，因为其中根本没有包括任何可以促成立刻停止朝鲜流血事件的内容——从一开始它就是打算继续战争的，它使解决战俘问题的一切努力都注定要失败。这是可以理解的，因为在这个提案中，整个问题归根结蒂不过是使在朝鲜的交战双方只交换那些“自愿”回到他本国去的战俘，而其余的战俘，按照这个提案，则必须听任遣返委员会的摆布，这就意味着听任美国人的摆布。
    但是，大家都知道，在遣返委员会中的公断人是联合国，而联合国是交战一方。不消说，要求联合国做解决战俘问题的公断人这样的办法是史无前例的，也是不公平的，是绝对不能容许的。由此可知，已通过的提案并不真正打算实现朝鲜停火，也不打算遵照国际法原则、日内瓦公约及基本的国际准则来解决战俘问题。
    现在讲出这一点来是必要的，因为有人自觉地或不自觉地曾试图使这个提案看来好像真能作为解决战俘问题、甚至解决整个朝鲜问题的基础似的。联合国大会现在既已收到了中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的答复，这两个答复都正确地指出了美国强加于联合国大会的这个决议案的非法性质，既然如此，大家就可以看得清楚，这个决议案过去和现在都不能够作为解决这问题的基础，因为它的目的正与此相反，同时还要欺骗舆论。紧接着这个议案的通过美国便在蜂岩岛上屠杀朝中战俘，这难道是偶然的事件吗？当然不是。
    各位代表先生们，难道联合国大会对朝鲜美国军事当局对朝中战俘所犯的罪行能够熟视无睹吗？如果它真正珍视它的威信，它就绝对不能这样作。它就绝对不能容忍这种践踏人道和道义原则的行为，不能容忍这种明目张胆地违反关于战俘待遇问题的公认的国际法原则的行为。大会有责任采取紧急的适当措施，制止美国军事当局为了有计划地杀害朝中战俘而在朝鲜进行的罪恶行动。
    在这种情况下，大会绝对有必要在休会前立即处理苏联代表团提出的“关于美国军事当局集体屠杀蜂岩岛上的朝鲜和中国战俘”的问题以及苏联就这个问题所提出的提案，并作出适当的决定。
    由于美军司令部是在联合国的旗帜的掩护下犯了这种罪行的，所以大会更有责任对这种屠杀朝中战俘的罪行采取行动。
    苏联代表团特向大会提出下一提案：“鉴于下述新的事实：在一九五二年十二月十四日，美国军事当局屠杀蜂岩岛上的朝鲜与中国战俘，结果，八十二名朝鲜与中国战俘被杀，一百二十名受伤，
    “鉴于这种集体屠杀美国战俘营里的朝鲜与中国战俘的行为带有有计划杀戮战俘的性质——这已由美国军事当局对巨济岛、济州岛、蜂岩岛、釜山和其他地方战俘营中的战俘干出的许多暴行得到证明，
    联合国大会特谴责朝鲜美国军事当局这些践踏人道与人类道德的基本原则以及悍然破坏国际法中关于战俘待遇问题的公认准则的罪行，
    坚决要求美国政府火速采取措施，终止美国军事当局对朝鲜与中国战俘所犯下的罪行，并严惩犯下这些罪行的人。”
    我们希望这个提案得到其他代表团的支持，并希望大会有足够的力量制止美国军事当局在朝鲜的暴行和杀戮行为——有计划地集体屠杀朝鲜美国战俘营中的朝鲜与中国战俘的行为。同时，苏联代表团促请联合国大会注意：那些没有足够的勇气拥护这个正义要求的国家也要因此负严重的责任。
