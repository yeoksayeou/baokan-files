Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd:

    Since November, most parts of the country have begun to adjust commercial work in accordance with the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government. The main purpose of this adjustment of commerce is to better exert the leading role of state-owned commerce and the enthusiasm of private commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so as to further develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, invigorate the market, and meet the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin.
    The methods for this adjustment of commerce are divided into three aspects: First, rationally adjust price differences and implement policies that take into account production, transportation, and consumption. State-owned trading companies in various regions should appropriately expand wholesale and retail price differences and raise the starting point for wholesale. Regional price differences, especially the price differences between areas with convenient transportation and remote areas, should also be appropriately expanded. Second, appropriately adjust and divide the scope of business operations between public and private commerce. State-owned trading companies should mainly focus on implementing and strengthening wholesale business, with retail sales aimed at stabilizing market prices. State-owned companies and cooperatives should appropriately reduce the operation of minor commodities. Third, regarding market management issues, it is necessary to eliminate various inappropriate restrictions on legitimate private merchants that hinder the smooth flow of goods between urban and rural areas, but necessary management of the market must be carried out to prevent private merchants from engaging in speculation and profiteering.
    Since the autumn of this year, industry and commerce have become increasingly active throughout the country, and the total turnover of commercial businesses has increased accordingly. Among them, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have increased faster, while private commerce has not increased enough, and some have even stagnated. This situation is not in line with the needs of today's people's economy and the large-scale economic construction that the country is about to begin. Although some private commercial activities that are not needed for urban-rural goods exchange and a small number of illegitimate private commercial activities are bound to be naturally eliminated, most private commercial activities should maintain a certain level of turnover along with the development of industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, it is very necessary to adjust commercial work today.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Xi'an and other cities in East China, Central South, and Northwest China have begun to adjust commercial work since November.
    In mid-November, the Central South Military and Political Committee issued a proclamation on six measures to invigorate the primary market. The six measures stipulated reasonable price adjustments, implementation of policies that take into account production, transportation, and consumption, state-owned trade should appropriately expand urban-rural and wholesale-retail price differences for commodities, and appropriately raise the wholesale starting point; strict implementation of tax policies, implementing tax calculation according to rates, and simplifying procedures; adjusting public-private labor-capital relations, implementing policies that take into account both public and private interests and labor-capital benefits; vigorously organizing transportation forces to support material exchange; strengthening the leadership of the primary market and carrying out material exchange meetings. In order to uniformly study and review the price adjustment work in the entire region, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee established a Price Review Committee, composed of 150 cadres from relevant financial and economic departments, to review, study, and adjust commodity prices and formulate plans in terms of wholesale and retail price differences, regional price differences, and costs. Wuhan City started the adjustment work earlier. Among them, Wuhan Department Store Company adjusted the wholesale and retail price differences of 1,748 kinds of daily necessities in 12 categories on November 20.
    Before adjusting commerce, Shanghai conducted a long period of investigation and research, sending out 2,000 groups to conduct extensive investigations, and incorporated the opinions of the responsible persons of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce when drafting the adjustment plan. At the enlarged meeting of the Shanghai People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee on November 22, Shanghai Deputy Mayor Pan Hannian announced Shanghai's plan for adjusting commerce. These measures and plans guaranteed that private commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood would maintain a certain level of turnover along with the development of industrial and agricultural production. As of November 27, Shanghai had adjusted wholesale and retail price differences and wholesale starting points for more than 3,000 kinds of commodities.
    The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its sixth meeting on December 7 and 8 and made a resolution on adjusting commercial work. Currently, various parts of the Northwest are implementing specific measures to adjust commerce. State-owned specialized companies in Xi'an have raised the wholesale and retail price differences of sugar, matches, cigarettes, sneakers, soap, and other commodities by 1% to 4%, and the wholesale starting points for fabrics, cigarettes, and coal have been raised. Businessmen and industrialists in the city expressed warm support for these measures, and the Xi'an branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement of "Supporting the Report on Adjusting Commerce by Northwest Military and Political Committee Vice Chairman Ma Mingfang," saying that these measures not only opened up a wider road for the vast number of national industrialists and businessmen, but also ensured coordination and cooperation between various economic links, which will definitely benefit the large-scale economic construction of our motherland.
    The measures for adjusting commerce in various regions are now being gradually implemented, and some regions have implemented them down to the primary market.

### 发挥国营商业领导作用和私营商业积极性  全国大部地区进行调整商业工作

    发挥国营商业领导作用和私营商业积极性
    全国大部地区进行调整商业工作
    【新华社二十三日讯】十一月份以来，全国大部地区遵照中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会的决定着手进行调整商业工作。这次调整商业的主要目的，是为了更好地发挥国营商业的领导作用和有利于国计民生的私营商业的积极性，以便进一步开展城乡物资交流、活跃市场，迎接就要开始的大规模经济建设。
    这次调整商业的办法，分为三个方面：第一、合理地调整差价，贯彻产、运、消兼顾政策。各地国营贸易公司适当地扩大批零差价，并提高批发起点。地区差价，尤其是交通便利地区和偏僻地区间的差价也适当地扩大。第二、适当地调整和划分公私商业经营范围。国营贸易公司主要以贯彻并加强批发业务为主，零售商品以稳定市场物价为准，国营公司和合作社适当地减少次要商品的经营。第三、关于市场管理问题，要取缔妨碍畅通城乡物资交流的对正当私商的各种不适当的限制，但必须对市场进行必要的管理，防止私商投机倒把。
    今年入秋以来，全国各地工商业日趋活跃，商业方面的营业总额有了相应增加，其中以国营商业和合作社商业增加较快，私营商业增加不够，甚至有些停滞不前的现象。这种情况与今天人民经济发展和国家就要开始大规模经济建设的需要是不相适应的。虽然某些为城乡物资交流所不需要和少数不正当的私营商业难免要遭到自然淘汰，但是，应当有大部分私营商业，随着工、农业生产的发展而保持其一定的营业额水准。因此，今天进行调整商业工作是很必要的。
    据新华社讯：华东、中南、西北区的上海、武汉、广州、长沙、郑州、西安等城市已从十一月份开始进行调整商业工作。
    十一月中旬，中南军政委员会曾颁发了关于活跃初级市场六项措施的布告。该六项措施，对合理调整价格，贯彻产、运、消兼顾政策，国营贸易应适当扩大商品的城乡地区差价和批零差价，并适当提高批发起点；严格执行税收政策，贯彻依率计征，简化手续；调整公私劳资关系，贯彻公私兼顾、劳资两利政策；大力组织运输力量，扶助物资交流；加强初级市场领导，开展物资交流会等都作了规定。为了统一研究和审查全区调整差价工作，中南军政委员会财政经济委员会又成立了物价审查委员会，由有关财经部门的干部一百五十人组成，分批零差价、地区差价、成本三方面来审查研究和调整商品的价格并制订方案。武汉市调整工作着手较早，其中武汉市百货公司于十一月二十日就调整了日用品十二类一千七百四十八种商品的批零差价。
    上海市在调整商业之前，曾进行了长时间的调查研究，派出两千个小组进行广泛的调查，在拟订调整方案时曾吸收了上海市工商业联合会负责人的意见。在十一月二十二日上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会扩大会议上，上海市副市长潘汉年宣布了上海市调整商业的方案。这些措施同方案都保障了有利于国计民生的私营商业，随着工农业生产的发展保持其一定的营业额水准。截至十一月二十七日止上海市已调整批零差价及批发起点的商品达三千余种。
    西北军政委员会于十二月七、八两日举行第六次会议，作出了调整商业工作的决议。目前西北各地正在执行调整商业的具体措施。西安市各国营专业公司已将糖、火柴、纸烟、球鞋、肥皂等商品的批零差价调高了百分之一到百分之四，布匹、纸烟、煤炭的批发起点都已提高。对这些措施，该市工商业者表示热烈的拥护，中国民主建国会西安市分会并发表“拥护西北军政委员会马明方副主席关于调整商业的报告”的声明说：这种措施不仅给广大民族工商业者开辟了更宽阔的道路，而且也确保各种经济环节之间的协调合作，必将有利于我们祖国大规模经济建设的进行。
    各地调整商业的措施，现在正在逐步贯彻中，个别地区已贯彻到初级市场。
