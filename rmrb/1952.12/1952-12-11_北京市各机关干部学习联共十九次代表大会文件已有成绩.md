Cadres, technical personnel of organs, enterprises, and factories and mines in Beijing, members of democratic parties, professors, staff, and students of universities and colleges, and teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools, totaling approximately 76,000 people, are enthusiastically studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it is expected that this will be completed by the end of the year. After this study, senior cadres will study Stalin's work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

When the above works and documents were first published, they attracted great attention from the people of the city. Cadres in various units spontaneously began reading and discussing these documents. The study documents sold in Beijing bookstores were quickly snapped up. The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China reprinted more than 70,000 copies of the study documents, but still could not meet the demand.

In early November, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee decided that cadres throughout the city should formally begin studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), stipulating that the study should be divided into three units according to the three parts of Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In the first unit, Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) should be studied at the same time; in the third unit, Khrushchev's report outline on the revision of the Party Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) should be studied at the same time, with other documents as reference. Leading cadres of many organs and factories and mines then made mobilization reports to the cadres of their units. The Party Committee of the People's Printing Factory called on cadres to combine the study of the second part of Malenkov's report with an examination of the shortcomings in enterprise management exposed in the increase production and practice economy campaign, and stipulated that the study of the third part of Malenkov's report should be combined with the year-end summary of the factory's Party work. When arranging the study, the leaders of the People's Art Theater asked cadres to pay special attention to studying the advanced experience of Soviet literature and art work and the principle of Party spirit in literature and art.

In order to help cadres throughout the city study the first part of Malenkov's report, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee invited Comrade Xiong Fu in late November to give a report on the current international situation to cadres in advanced theoretical study classes, instructors in intermediate classes, and theoretical teachers in elementary classes. All units relayed this report, which deepened the study of this part. Comrade Chen Jiakang gave reports on the international situation at Tsinghua University and Beijing Normal University, and answered some difficult questions. Responsible comrades of many units, such as Comrade Zhou Ren, Secretary of the Dongdan District Party Committee, and Comrade Zhang Hongshun, Manager of the Construction Company, explained the first part of Malenkov's report to the cadres of their units, promoting the study of various units.

At present, the study of the "Soviet International Environment" section has ended. After this period of study, the vast number of cadres have gained a lot: (1) Cadres have a clearer understanding of the fundamental characteristics of the current international situation. They are deeply impressed by the sharp contrast between the two camps, the two world markets, the two basic economic laws, and the two world economic development routes. Many people said that in the past, looking at the international situation was a tangle of complicated and chaotic, but now it is clear. (2) Cadres have a further understanding of the nature and role of the peace movement. Everyone realizes that due to the increasing strength of the peace and democratic camp and the peace policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, it is difficult for imperialism to launch a war of aggression against the socialist camp; and the contradictions between imperialists are deepening, and war between imperialists is inevitable. The peace movement can stop and delay new wars. Striving for peace is the most urgent demand of the people of the world. Therefore, many cadres criticized the idea of ​​disregarding the peace movement, and they have a further understanding of the significance of the International Economic Conference, the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference, and the upcoming World People's Peace Congress. (3) Through the study of the two world economic development routes, cadres realized the superiority of the socialist system and the people's democratic system. Many cadres have strengthened their determination to learn from the Soviet Union and their confidence in building a new China after seeing the rapid development of the Soviet national economy. Li Guifu, an engineer at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said that through this study, he is even more convinced that Soviet production technology and science are the most advanced in the world, and he must learn from Soviet advanced experience with an open mind in the future. Medical workers at the Beijing Mental Hospital expressed that they would study Pavlov's theory with greater enthusiasm. (4) This study has broadened the horizons of cadres and made them more concerned about the struggle situation of the people of the world. Some cadres who have not been very concerned about politics said that they used to think about firewood, rice, oil, and salt all day long, but now they see the path of the Soviet people and think about the future of the world and the motherland, and they cannot but put all their strength into doing a good job. Duan Ning, a teacher at the Xiaxie Street Primary School, has been teaching for more than 30 years and has never liked to read newspapers. After this study, she reads newspapers or listens to international news broadcasts whenever she has time, and often discusses current affairs with other teachers. In many organs, the number of people subscribing to "People's Weekly", "Current Affairs Manual", and "World Knowledge" has greatly increased. More than 80% of the cadres of the Real Estate Administration Bureau subscribe to newspapers and magazines.

It can be seen from this study that most cadres lack knowledge of political economy, and it is difficult to thoroughly understand the issue of capitalist economic crises, especially the issue of arms expansion and war preparations deepening economic crises; many cadres are unclear about some historical facts in international relations, and even do not understand terms such as "Tehran Conference" and "Potsdam Proclamation". The leaders of some units explained these issues to the cadres early, which facilitated their study of the documents.

### 北京市各机关干部学习联共十九次代表大会文件已有成绩

    北京市各机关干部学习联共十九次代表大会文件已有成绩
    北京市各机关、企业、厂矿的干部、技术人员，各民主党派人士，各高等学校的教授、职员和学生，中小学教职员，约七万六千人正在热烈地学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件，预计年底可以结束。高级干部将于这次学习结束后，学习斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。
    上述著作和文件刚发表的时候，就引起了全市人民极大的注意。各单位干部自动展开了对这些文件的阅读和讨论。北京市各书店出售的学习文件迅即被抢购一空。中共北京市委宣传部翻印了七万多份学习文件，仍不敷需要。
    十一月初，市委宣传部决定全市干部正式开始学习联共十九次代表大会的文件，规定学习的步骤是按照马林科夫在联共十九次代表大会上所作的报告的三个部分分成三个单元进行。在第一单元，同时学习斯大林在联共第十九次代表大会上的演说；在第三单元，同时学习赫鲁晓夫关于联共党章修正案的报告提纲，并以其他文件作为参考。许多机关、厂矿的领导干部随即向本单位干部作了学习动员报告。人民印刷厂党委号召干部结合马林科夫报告第二部分的学习检查该厂在增产节约运动中暴露出来的企业管理上的缺点，并规定在学习马林科夫报告第三部分时结合该厂党的工作进行年终总结。人民艺术剧院领导上在布置学习时，要求干部特别注意学习苏联文艺工作的先进经验和文艺中的党性原则。
    为了帮助全市干部学习马林科夫报告第一部分，十一月下旬市委宣传部请熊复同志对理论学习高级班干部、中级班辅导员、初级班理论教员作了关于当前国际形势的报告。各单位都传达了这个报告，使这一部分的学习又深入了一步。陈家康同志先后在清华大学和北京师范大学作了关于国际形势的报告，并解答了一些疑难问题。许多单位的负责同志，如东单区区委书记周仁同志、建筑公司经理张鸿舜同志等，都向本单位干部讲解了马林科夫报告的第一部分，推动了各单位的学习。
    目前“苏联国际环境”部分的学习已经结束。广大干部经过这段学习已经有了很大收获：（一）干部对目前国际形势的根本特点有了较明确的认识。他们对两个阵营、两个世界市场、两个基本经济法则、两条世界经济发展路线的鲜明对比印象很深。许多人说，过去看国际形势是头绪繁多，混乱一团，现在看来是清清楚楚。（二）干部对和平运动的性质和作用有了进一步的认识。大家认识到由于和平民主阵营的日益强大和苏联及人民民主国家的和平政策，帝国主义要发动进攻社会主义阵营的战争是困难的；而帝国主义之间的矛盾日益加深，帝国主义之间的战争是不可避免的。和平运动可以制止和延缓新的战争。争取和平是世界人民当前最迫切的要求。因此，许多干部批判了轻视和平运动的思想，他们对国际经济会议、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和即将召开的世界人民和平大会的意义有了进一步的认识。（三）通过世界经济两条发展路线的学习，干部体会到社会主义制度和人民民主制度的优越性。许多干部看到苏联国民经济的飞跃发展，加强了学习苏联的决心和建设新中国的信心。石景山钢铁厂工程师李贵馥说，他通过这次学习更加确信苏联的生产技术和科学是世界上最先进的，今后一定要虚心学习苏联先进经验。北京市精神病院医务工作者们表示要以更大的热情来学习巴夫洛夫学说。（四）这次学习扩大了干部的眼界，使他们更加关心世界人民的斗争形势。一些一向不大关心政治的干部说，他们过去成天想着柴米油盐，现在看看苏联人民的道路，想想世界和祖国的前途，便不能不拿出全部力量来搞好工作。下斜街小学教员段凝教了三十多年书，一向不大爱看报纸，经过这次学习，一有空就看报或听国际新闻广播，并经常和其他教员谈论时事。在许多机关中，订阅“人民周报”、“时事手册”、“世界知识”的人数，已大大增加。房地产管理局干部中订阅报纸杂志的达百分之八十以上。
    从这次学习当中看出，多数干部由于缺乏政治经济学的知识，对资本主义经济危机的问题，特别是对扩军备战加深了经济危机的问题较难透彻了解；许多干部对国际关系上的一些史实不清楚，甚至像“德黑兰会议”、“波茨坦公告”这类名词也不了解。有些单位的领导者及早地为干部解释了这些问题，便利了他们对文件的钻研。
