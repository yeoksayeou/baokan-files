    大阪日中友协成立
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：促进日本与中国人民之间的友谊的运动继续在日本发展。十月三十日，大阪日本中国友好协会正式在大阪成立，当天晚上并在大阪的中央公会堂举行了盛大的“日本中国友好晚会”，庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年。到会的达三千人。日中友好协会副会长平野义太郎和理事长内山完造特从东京赶来参加，并在会上发表演说。晚会上由大阪的民主文化界人士演出“黄河大合唱”，这个节目得到观众的称赞。
    大阪日中友好协会在正式成立以前的筹备期间和正式成立以后，曾进行了许多介绍中国文化的活动。十月十九日鲁迅逝世纪念日，曾举行“鲁迅纪念会”；十一月十日和十一日，由日本著名的进步剧团“前进座”演出郭沫若的历史剧“屈原”，观众深为剧情所感动。
    大阪日中友好协会还致力于促进日中两国经济交流的活动，“关西日中贸易促进会议”就是在协会筹备会的发起之下在今年夏季成立的，现在协会正准备进行有关促进日中贸易的宣传活动。
