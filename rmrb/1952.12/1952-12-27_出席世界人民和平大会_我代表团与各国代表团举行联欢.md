Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 23rd (Delayed Dispatch) The Chinese delegation attending the World People's Peace Congress held friendly gatherings with delegations from other countries in Vienna, further strengthening the friendship between China and other countries in the struggle for peace.

On the evening of the 18th, the Chinese delegation hosted a banquet for the Indian delegation. Guo Moruo, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation and the host of the banquet, said that for more than two thousand years, China and India—the two largest neighboring countries in Asia—have never engaged in war with each other, and have never even quarreled. Guo Moruo said that some people harbor an illusion of wanting Asians to fight Asians, but Asians will never fight Asians. At this point, the delegations from both countries applauded warmly. Dr. Kitchlew, the head of the Indian delegation, reiterated the long-standing friendship between China and India. Dr. Kitchlew said:

"Let me assure our Chinese friends that the Indian people will never become victims of those who want Asians to fight Asians." Everyone present stood up, and the enthusiastic applause lasted for a long time. Those who spoke at the banquet also included famous Indian writers Dusha, Singh, Anand, and Chinese representatives Mao Dun, Zhang Bojun, and Luo Longji. Everyone repeatedly toasted to the lasting friendship between China and India and to the great unity of the Asian people in the struggle for world peace.

On the evening of the 19th, delegations from various Asian countries attending the Vienna Peace Congress gathered for dinner at the Kur Hotel. At the banquet, Guo Moruo toasted to the happiness of the people of every Asian country and to the health of the representatives of all countries. The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of harmony and joy, and then the banquet turned into an impromptu concert, where various Asian songs were sung. Among the singers put forward by various Asian countries were the famous Chinese patriotic artist Chang Xiangyu and the famous Japanese actor Nakamura Kanzaburo.

A Burmese representative sang a song he wrote while in prison.

An Indonesian representative sang a song he wrote in praise of the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The quartet by four representatives from Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and Thailand was warmly welcomed. The sound of clinking glasses, singing, laughter, and applause continued until late at night.

On the second day after the successful closing of the World People's Peace Congress, on the 20th, the Chinese delegation and the American delegation gathered for dinner at the Kur Hotel. Although some American representatives had to leave Vienna that night, they still attended the banquet. Guo Moruo extended greetings to the American people and their delegation and toasted to the friendship between the Chinese and American people and world peace. At the request of American friends, the Chinese delegation sang "People All Over the World Are of One Heart," and the American delegation sang an anti-war song: "I will lay down my sword and shield by the riverside,... I will study war no more." Before the end of the banquet, Liu Ningyi, the Secretary-General of the Chinese delegation, said to the American delegation: "The two songs sung tonight demonstrate the great unity of the people of all countries and the American people's will to oppose war. Peace is the common aspiration of all people. The Chinese People's Volunteers want to live a peaceful life. American soldiers also want to go home and live a peaceful life. Similarly, the Korean people also want to live a peaceful life in their own country. Let us work together for peace!"

    出席世界人民和平大会
    我代表团与各国代表团举行联欢
    【新华社维也纳二十三日电】（迟到）出席世界人民和平大会的中国代表团与其他国家代表团在维也纳举行了友好集会，进一步加强了中国与其他国家在争取和平的斗争中的友谊。
    在十八日晚上，中国代表团设宴招待印度代表团。宴会主人中国代表团副团长郭沫若说，两千多年来，中国和印度——亚洲的两个最大的毗邻的国家——彼此从未进行过战争，甚至也从未争吵过。郭沫若说，有些人抱有一种幻想，要想使亚洲人打亚洲人，但亚洲人决不打亚洲人，他说到这里，两国代表团热烈地鼓起掌来。印度代表团团长克其鲁博士重申中印两国的悠久的友谊。克其鲁博士说：
    “让我向我们的中国朋友保证，印度人民永远不会成为那些想使亚洲人打亚洲人的人的牺牲者。”出席宴会的人全体起立，热烈的掌声经久不息。在宴会上发言的人还有印度著名作家迪沙、辛格、安纳德及中国代表茅盾、章伯钧和罗隆基。大家并一再为持久的中印友谊干杯，为亚洲人民在争取世界和平的斗争中的大团结干杯。
    在十九日晚上，出席维也纳和平大会的各亚洲国家代表团在库尔饭店聚餐。郭沫若在宴会上为每个亚洲国家的人民的幸福干杯，并为各国代表的健康干杯。宴会在融洽和愉快的空气中进行，接着宴会变成了临时组成的音乐会，会上演唱了各种亚洲歌曲。在各亚洲国家所推出的歌手中，有中国的著名爱国艺人常香玉及著名的日本演员中村玩右卫门。
    一位缅甸代表歌唱了他自己在狱中时所作的歌曲。
    一位印尼代表唱了他自己作的歌颂亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的歌子。越南、马来亚、菲律宾和泰国的四位代表的合唱受到热烈的欢迎。碰杯声、歌唱声、笑声和鼓掌声一直继续到深夜。
    在世界人民和平大会胜利闭幕的第二天，在二十
    日那一天，中国代表团和美国代表团在库尔饭店聚餐。虽然有些美国代表当天晚上要离开维也纳，但他们仍参加了宴会。郭沫若向美国人民和他们的代表团致意，并为中美两国人民的友谊和世界和平干杯。中国代表团在美国朋友的要求下唱了“全世界人民心一条”，美国代表团则唱了一支反战的歌：“我要在河边放下我的战刀和盾牌，……我不再研究战争了”。在宴会结束前，中国代表团秘书长刘宁一向美国代表团说：“今晚唱的这两支歌表现了各国人民的大团结和美国人民反对战争的意志。和平是一切人们的共同愿望。中国人民志愿军希望过和平生活。美国士兵也想回家过和平生活。同样地，朝鲜人民也想在他们自己的祖国过和平生活。让我们共同为争取和平而努力吧！”（附图片）
