Xinhua News Agency report: Another large number of factories and mines across the country have successively completed their annual production plans or increased production and conservation plans ahead of schedule.

    In Shenyang City, forty-five state-owned and local state-owned factories have already completed their annual production plans and increased production and conservation plans ahead of schedule. These factories are now putting forward new goals as a gift to welcome next year's large-scale national economic construction. Shenyang Paint Factory, which exceeded its annual production and conservation plan by 11.5% at the end of November, recently proposed to increase production and conserve wealth equivalent to 10,000 tons of grain for the country before the end of the year. Liaodong Province's local state-owned Shenyang Chemical Plant also decided to increase production and conserve wealth equivalent to 11,000 tons of grain before the end of the year. Units that have not yet completed their annual plans are also striving to complete them ahead of schedule or on time.

    Workers and staff of state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Fushun City have overfulfilled the annual production increase and conservation plan one month ahead of schedule. As of the end of November, workers throughout the city had increased production and conserved wealth equivalent to 1,052,940 tons of grain for the country, exceeding the annual production increase and conservation plan of various factories and mines by 23.5% and exceeding the state's annual production increase and conservation task by 67.2%. Factories and mines that have completed their plans have recently set new goals. The main reason why workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises in Fushun City completed the production increase and conservation plan ahead of schedule is that they vigorously launched a campaign to find tricks and promote advanced experience. According to statistics up to the beginning of November, workers in the city created more than 30,000 pieces of advanced experience and found tricks. Over the past year, various factories and mines in the city have also promoted more than 40 kinds of important advanced production experiences such as cyclical coal mining, rapid steelmaking, and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods, which have significantly improved workers' production efficiency and increased a large amount of wealth for the country.

    The state-owned Central China Iron and Steel Company completed the state's annual production plan on December 10. This year, the state assigned the company production tasks for pig iron, steel ingots, steel, and metal castings, all of which were higher than last year's actual output. Steel ingot was 1.36 times higher; steel was 62% higher; pig iron was 22.8% higher. The plant's production increase plan this year is equivalent to 33% of the national plan for pig iron; steel is equivalent to 12.5% of the national plan; steel is equivalent to 20% of the national plan. Adding the state plan and the production increase plan, the company's total output value this year increased by 1.6 times compared with last year's actual output. As of December 10, the steel production increase plan had been overfulfilled by 237%; pig iron had also been completed by 91%. All employees of the company are striving to overfulfill all kinds of products' production increase plans before the end of the year in order to welcome the motherland's large-scale economic construction.

    The Yumen Mining Bureau completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule on December 1. According to statistics as of December 1: the main product gasoline exceeded by 10.5%, kerosene exceeded by 18.9%, and heavy machine oil exceeded by 27.5%. The bureau's factories and teams launched a enthusiastic patriotic production increase movement this year, mainly focused on promoting advanced experience and rationalization proposals. From January to the end of October, 2,513 rationalization proposals were adopted, which greatly improved production efficiency, thus enabling the annual production plan to be completed one month ahead of schedule.

    Workers and staff of the Southwest State-owned 301 Potassium Chlorate Plant actively studied advanced Soviet experience and completed the annual production task assigned by the state on November 30 ahead of schedule. The output increased by one and a half times compared with last year; the quality fully met the specifications set by the state; and the cost was reduced by 11.34% compared with last year. The 301 Plant's production tasks in the first half of the year could not be completed on a monthly basis, and the supply of raw materials and electricity was abnormal, and the various processes could not be well coordinated. In order to overcome these chaotic phenomena, the plant vigorously promoted the advanced Soviet experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" in the second half of this year, improved the supply of raw materials, and made accurate arrangements for the matching of the production capacity of machines in various processes, thus ensuring the monthly production tasks were completed on schedule.

    各地又有一批厂矿提前完成全年生产任务
    据新华社讯：各地又有一大批厂矿，相继提前完成全年生产计划或增产节约计划。
    沈阳市已有四十五个国营和地方国营工厂提前完成了全年生产计划和增产节约计划。这些工厂目前正纷纷提出新的奋斗目标，作为迎接明年全国大规模经济建设的献礼。早在十一月底超额百分之十一点五完成了全年增产节约计划的沈阳油漆厂，最近又提出要在年底前再为国家增产节约一万吨粮食的财富；辽东省地方国营沈阳化学厂，也决定到年底前再增产节约一万一千吨粮食的财富。部分还没有完成全年计划的单位也在努力争取提前或按期完成计划。
    抚顺市国营和地方国营工矿企业职工已提前一个月超额完成全年增产节约计划。截至十一月底，全市职工已为国家增产节约一百零五万二千九百四十吨粮食的财富，超过各厂矿全年增产节约计划百分之二十三点五，超过国家给予的全年增产节约任务百分之六十七点二，已完成计划的厂矿，最近又纷纷订出新的奋斗目标。抚顺市各工矿企业职工提前完成增产节约计划的主要原因是大力展开了找窍门和推广先进经验的运动。截至十一月初的统计，该市职工创造的先进经验和找出的窍门就达三万多件；一年来，该市各厂矿还先后推广了周期采煤、快速炼钢、多刀多刃切削法等四十多种重要的先进生产经验，使工人的生产效率显著提高，为国家增产了大量财富。
    国营华中钢铁公司已在十二月十日完成全年的国家生产计划。今年国家交给该公司的生铁、钢锭、钢材和金属铸造品的生产任务，都比去年的实际产量高。计钢锭高一点三六倍；钢材高百分之六十二；生铁高百分之二十二点八。该厂今年的增产计划，生铁等于国家计划的百分之三十三；钢等于国家计划的百分之十二点五；钢材等于国家计划的百分之二十。国家计划加上增产计划，该公司今年的生产总值比去年的实际产量增加了一点六倍。到十二月十日，钢材的增产计划已超额完成百分之二百三十七；生铁也已完成百分之九十一；该公司全体职工为了迎接祖国大规模经济建设，正为年底以前争取全部超额完成各种产品的增产计划而奋斗。
    玉门矿务局已在十二月一日提前完成全年生产计划。截止十二月一日的统计：主要产品汽油超额百分之十点五，煤油超额百分之十八点九，重机油超额百分之二十七点五。该矿务局各厂、队曾在今年内热烈地展开以推广先进经验和合理化建议为主要内容的爱国增产运动。从一月到十月底被采用的合理化建议就有二千五百一十三件，生产效率大大提高，因而使全年生产计划提早一月完成。
    西南国营三零一氯酸钾厂职工积极学习苏联先进经验，已在十一月三十日提前完成国家所给予的全年生产任务。产量比去年提高一倍半；质量完全符合国家所定的规格；成本比去年降低百分之十一点三四。三零一厂上半年的生产任务，都没有能够按月完成，原材料和电力供应不正常，各工序间也不能很好配合。该厂为了克服这些混乱现象，在今年后半年大力推行了苏联“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验，改进了原材料的供应，对各工序机器的生产能力的配合作了准确的安排，因而保证了每月生产任务按期完成。
