    Fushun Steel Plant Begins to Address Workers' Restroom Problems

    Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Rong Quanjian in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on October 27, regarding the lack of restrooms for employees in our steelmaking workshop, is correct.

    Our attention to workers' health care has been very inadequate. During the enemy and puppet regime, they did not care about the health of the workers at all, only building a small room by the windows near the steel furnace as a restroom for electric furnace workers, but the restroom was very smoky and poorly ventilated. This June, the restroom was torn down, and the original trade union office was converted into a restroom for electric furnace workers, but the leadership did not consider that the western steelmaking workshop was too far from the restroom, and it was very inconvenient for workers to change clothes and eat when it was cold.

    We have now decided to build a restroom in the west to solve the restroom problem for electric furnace workers in the western steelmaking workshop. In addition, most of the workers' restrooms in various departments of the factory are small and dilapidated. We are now working on building them separately, preparing to make them fully equipped and clean. We also plan to completely solve the problem of workers' restrooms in our factory next year to protect the health of the workers.

    抚顺制钢厂已着手解决工人休息室问题
    编辑同志：人民日报十月二十七日“读者来信”栏，刊登荣全鉴同志对我厂炼钢车间没有安设职工休息室的批评，是正确的。
    我们对工人保健方面的照顾很不周到。敌伪时期，根本不关心工人的健康，只在炼钢炉旁窗下筑了一个小房作为电炉工人的休息室，但该休息室烟尘很大，通风不良。今年六月份拆掉该休息室，把原来的工会办公室改为电炉工人休息室，但领导方面并未考虑到西部炼钢车间距离休息室太远，天冷时工人换衣、吃饭很不方便。
    现在我们已决定在西部建筑一所休息室，解决西部炼钢车间电炉工人的休息问题。另外厂里各部门的工人休息室，大部分是狭小破旧的，我们现正在分头着手修建，准备做到设备齐全，室内清洁。并计划在明年内把我们厂的工人休息室问题彻底解决，以保护工人的健康。抚顺制钢厂
