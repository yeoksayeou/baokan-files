    New Nankai University Established in Tianjin
    The new comprehensive university, Nankai University, was officially established in Tianjin on the 29th of last month. On the afternoon of that day, the school held a grand inauguration and opening ceremony in the newly built auditorium. Minister Ma Xulun of the Central Higher Education Ministry and others attended to offer congratulations. The Soviet Consul General in Tianjin, Matiev, was also invited to attend. At the meeting, Minister Ma Xulun, Chairman Huang Songling of the Tianjin Municipal Culture and Education Committee, and Vice President Yang Shixian of Nankai University all spoke. They unanimously pointed out that all teachers and students should work together to further improve teaching reform and teaching work.
    Northeast Forest Areas Actively Carry Out Illiteracy Elimination Campaign
    Since the promotion of the rapid literacy method in the Northeast forest areas in mid-May, the Northeast Forest Industry Trade Union Committee has successively held two training courses for rapid literacy method cadres, training a total of 194 full-time teachers, 18 cultural and educational cadres, and 24 members of the illiteracy elimination work group; and organized 378 full-time or part-time teachers to conduct internships in 31 pilot areas such as forest railways and lumber mills, with 7,098 students participating in the pilot classes.
    Since the start of the illiteracy elimination work in the forest areas, it has been warmly welcomed by the workers and has received attention and support from the leadership. For example, in the Jilin, Liaodong, and Jiamusi forest areas, the work has progressed smoothly due to the importance attached to it by the leadership and the cooperation of all relevant parties. However, in some individual areas, the ideological pace of leaders at all levels has not yet been aligned, resulting in a long-term lack of teachers, classrooms, or guaranteed time, and even some pilot classes have been suspended midway. In order to correct these deviations and strengthen the leadership, the Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Forest Industry Trade Union Committee jointly transferred cadres in early September to form the Office of the Northeast Forestry Illiteracy Elimination Committee, and jointly convened a meeting of relevant cadres such as personnel section chiefs, trade union cultural and educational ministers, education work group leaders, women's committee members, and cultural and educational committee members from the forest area administrations. The propaganda ministers of the Party committees and the Communist Youth League committees of each unit also attended. Through this meeting, the relevant cadres gained a further understanding of the major political significance of the illiteracy elimination work. The seven major forest areas in the Northeast have successively established illiteracy elimination campaign committees, transferred cadres, actively trained teachers, and vigorously carried out the work of promoting rapid literacy. According to incomplete statistics, each forest area can train 700 teachers by the end of this year to participate in the large-scale illiteracy elimination work in the future. At present, each forest area is formulating plans in accordance with the principle of proceeding from point to area and developing steadily, and gradually carrying out illiteracy elimination work, striving to completely eliminate the 60,000 illiterates among the existing fixed workers by the end of 1954.
    Guangdong Provincial Department of Culture and Education and Other Units Hold Illiteracy Elimination Symposium
    In order to convey the spirit of the Central South Illiteracy Elimination Work Conference, to preliminarily summarize the experience of the pilot program of promoting the rapid literacy method in Guangdong Province, and to discuss the illiteracy elimination work in Guangdong Province this winter and next spring, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the South China Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation jointly convened the Guangdong Provincial Illiteracy Elimination Work Symposium from November 5th to 10th. Attendees included staff from the People's Governments and trade union cultural and educational departments of Jieyang, Qujiang, and Bao'an counties and Shantou and Zhanjiang cities, as well as representatives from pilot counties and cities such as Heshan and Jiangmen, totaling more than 20 people. The meeting conveyed the spirit of the Central South Illiteracy Elimination Work Conference and launched a discussion on this issue. After several days of discussion and research, and exchanging some experiences from the pilot work, the representatives further understood the principles and tasks of the illiteracy elimination work stipulated by the Central South Region. The meeting determined that Shantou City, Zhanjiang City, Jieyang County, Qujiang County, and Bao'an County would be the focus of launching illiteracy elimination work, preparing to create experience in carrying out mass illiteracy elimination in these areas and to do a good job in training teachers.

    新的南开大学在天津成立
    新型的综合性大学——南开大学，已于上月二十九日在天津正式成立。当日下午该校在新建的大礼堂举行了隆重的成立和开学典礼。中央高等教育部马叙伦部长等到会祝贺。苏联驻津总领事马铁夫亦应邀出席。会上马叙伦部长、天津市文教委员会黄松龄主任委员、南开大学杨石先副校长都讲了话。他们一致指出：全校师生应共同努力更进一步作好教学改革工作，作好教学工作。
    东北各林区积极开展扫除文盲运动
    东北林区自五月中旬推行速成识字法以来，东北森林工业工会委员会曾先后举办了两期速成识字法干部训练班，共训练了一百九十四名专任教师、十八名文教干部、二十四名扫除文盲工作组人员；并组织了三百七十八名专任或兼任教师在森林铁路、制材厂等三十一处试点地区进行了实习，参加试点班学习的有七千零九十八名学员。
    林区的扫除文盲工作开始后，受到职工的热烈欢迎，并得到领导上的注意和支持。如吉林、辽东、佳木斯林区，由于领导的重视和各有关方面的配合，工作开展都比较顺利。但也有个别地区的各级领导，思想步调还未取得一致，因此造成长期缺乏师资、没有教室或时间得不到保证等等现象，甚至有些试点班中途停课。为了纠正这些偏差和加强领导力量，东北人民政府林业部、东北森林工业工会委员会于九月上旬共同抽调干部，组成东北林业扫除文盲委员会办公室，并联合召开了各林区管理局的人事科长、工会文教部长、教育工作组长、妇女委员、文教委员等有关干部的会议，各单位党委、团委的宣传部长亦出席参加。经过这次会议，有关干部对扫除文盲工作的重大政治意义有了进一步的认识，东北七大林区均先后成立了扫除文盲运动委员会，抽调干部，积极训练师资，大力开展推行速成识字的工作。据不完全统计，各林区到今年年底可训练出七百名教师，参加今后的大规模扫除文盲工作。目前，各林区正按照由点到面、稳步发展的方针，制订计划，逐步开展扫除文盲工作，争取到一九五四年末，全部扫除现有的固定职工中的六万文盲。
    广东省文教厅等单位召开扫除文盲座谈会
    为了传达中南扫除文盲工作会议的精神，初步总结广东省推行速成识字法试点的经验，和讨论广东省今冬明春的扫除文盲工作，广东省人民政府文教厅、广东省总工会筹备会、青年团华南工作委员会、广东省民主妇女联合会筹备会特在十一月五日至十日联合召开了广东省扫除文盲工作座谈会。到会的有揭阳、曲江、宝安三县和汕头、湛江二市人民政府和工会文教部门工作人员以及鹤山、江门等试点县市的代表共二十余人。会议传达了中南扫除文盲工作会议的精神，并对这问题展开了讨论。经过了几天的讨论和研究，并交流了试点工作的一些经验，代表们进一步了解了中南区规定的扫除文盲工作的方针和任务。会议确定了以汕头市、湛江市、揭阳县、曲江县和宝安县为展开扫除文盲工作的重点，准备在这些地区创造开展群众性的扫除文盲经验，做好训练师资的工作。
