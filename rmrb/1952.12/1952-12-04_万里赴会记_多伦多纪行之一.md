　　A Journey to the Meeting
    ——Toronto Travelogue, Part 1
    Wu Wentao

    Editor's Note: This newspaper will successively publish several newsletters of "Toronto Travelogue." These were written by the author when he accompanied the Chinese delegation to the 18th International Red Cross Conference in Toronto. It reports on many situations in Canada and other capitalist countries. Therefore, although received later, its significance is undiminished.

                Farewell
    On the evening of July 22nd, I followed the Chinese delegation to the 18th International Red Cross Conference, switched to a four-engine passenger plane of the Belgian "Sabena" company in Brussels, and was about to fly over the North Atlantic at night. Just heard a few enthusiastic greetings: "Comrades, labor is glorious!" The plane door slammed shut.

    That was the voice of comrades working at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Belgium. They used the most cordial greetings of the Czechoslovak working people to bid farewell to the delegates. Amidst the roar of the engines, I couldn't hear what the delegates were saying in the cabin. It seemed to be words of gratitude.

    Having left the enthusiastic Prague at noon, no one expected that, in the Belgian capital thousands of miles away, Comrade Obuchlidal, the Czechoslovak Ambassador to Belgium, would come to the airport with his secretary and entourage to welcome us. It wasn’t until 6:00 p.m. that the Ambassador apologized for having to attend the Polish Embassy's National Day banquet that evening and bid us farewell. However, he instructed the secretary and entourage to stay and made sure they waited until everyone boarded the plane before leaving.

    I talked the longest with Comrade Hejtuchik, a steelworker of twenty years, whose face still carried a steel-red hue. Although he had only returned to Brussels from vacation in his homeland two months ago, he eagerly inquired about the latest developments in Czechoslovakia's construction, as if he had been away from his hometown for many years. His vacation in the country was originally for a month, but, "I felt like I had enough rest after a few days, so I went back to the steel mill to work for two weeks!" He said, "You know, we always feel that there is a shortage of labor in our socialist construction; at the same time, isn't it killing two birds with one stone to donate two weeks' wages to the Korean people?" I told this to a fellow delegate from the Korean Red Cross, and the two of them shook hands tightly for a long time.

    In the lounge of the airport, I had an unexpected conversation with an old Belgian gentleman with white hair and a scholarly look. Because he politely gave me the seat next to him, I sat down, handed him a "Chunghwa" brand cigarette, and started talking. I learned that he was the manager of a household utensil store in the suburbs of Brussels, waiting at the station to pick up his daughter. He admired the quality of the cigarette, asked about the price, and said it was cheaper than the inferior cigarettes on the Belgian market. He couldn't help but express some sighs: "People are increasingly unable to afford things. Unemployment is increasing day by day. Yesterday was National Day (Note: July 21st is the anniversary of Belgium's separation from the Netherlands and establishment of its own monarchy in 1831), small business people still set up stalls on the main roads in the suburbs as usual. Stall taxes have increased, but fewer people are buying. People have to think three times before spending one franc...!"

    I asked the old man: "Why can't people afford things? Why is there so much unemployment?" This question seemed to embarrass him. He looked at his watch, said that the plane his daughter was on should have arrived, and changed the subject. In fact, the problem is very obvious. The clouds of economic crisis are looming over Belgium and other capitalist countries.

            North Atlantic Night

    The night deepened. We had already reached the vast North Atlantic sky. The plane trembled from time to time, making it difficult to fall asleep, so I had to take out the various bourgeois newspapers prepared for passengers on the plane to pass the time.

    Flipping through the day's Paris *Le Monde*, the first big headline I saw was "France declares to the United States: France's financial and military policies are mainly determined by (American military) orders." This news revealed the serious impact caused by the United States' refusal to order from French arms factories according to the amount promised at the Lisbon Conference. The Binet cabinet, which is being led by the nose by American war merchants to expand its military, has revealed difficulties in fulfilling France's task of arming twelve divisions, as undertaken at the Lisbon Conference, in the face of financial, trade and social crises. Several British newspapers had headlines reporting on the social unrest caused by the Conservative government's refusal to increase wages for millions of workers. There, too, the problem was financial, trade, and social crises under the expansion of armaments.

    The most thought-provoking were the three editorials in that day's London *Times*. One of them was about the seriousness of the labor unrest; one was about trade with China, which openly pointed out that "British and American opinions are divided" on this issue; the other further explained the contradictions between Britain and the Schuman (actually the United States) plan, and the contradictions between the six "Schuman Plan countries" surrounding West German coal, steel competition and rearmament....

    This is the main content of several Western European bourgeois newspapers of the day.

    How sharply history mocks the reactionary bourgeoisie of Western Europe! When the Communists pointed out three or four years ago that the "Marshall Plan," the "North Atlantic Treaty," and the policy of restricting East-West trade proposed by the American "millionaires" would lead Western Europe to a dead end, the spokesmen of the Western European bourgeoisie said that it was "propaganda," intended to "divide Western countries"... Now, what the Communists said in the past has been grudgingly admitted by the Western European bourgeois newspapers.

    Time ticked away. It was already nine o'clock in the morning in Eastern Europe. Our plane was still flying west against the sun, two thousand feet above the dim clouds. Gradually, a glow of dawn shot out from the horizon behind us. When we broke out of the clouds and landed at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, Canada, it was still dark.

            Shameful "Overall Defense"

    It was said that due to storms in the eastern US-Canadian border area, it was not until 4:00 p.m. on July 23rd that we continued to fly west from Gander, passing through Montreal, Canada's largest city, and arriving in Toronto at 2:00 a.m. From Beijing, the delegates had traveled more than half the globe. As soon as we settled down at the "Royal York Hotel," a few people went to the meeting.

    After completing the formalities for journalist "filing," I opened the July 24th *New York Times* and learned that Mr. Charles Marshall, a member of the Policy Planning Staff of the US State Department, who was the Chief Observer of the US Government to the 18th International Red Cross Conference, was already arranging what might be called an overall "defense" to guard against "attacks" from the delegations of the Soviet Union, China, Korea, and other people's democratic countries.

    According to my understanding, the announced purpose of the International Red Cross Conference and the issues to be discussed at this conference were only centered on the principles of maintaining "humanity" and "alleviating human suffering"; what does it mean to be so apprehensive and defensive against others' "attacks" on such issues? This can only be described by the Chinese saying "a guilty conscience fears no ghost." When we were still waiting to change planes at Montreal Airport, a large group of Canadian and American journalists roundaboutly inquired about the content of the proposals of the Chinese and Korean delegations. They were especially concerned about: "Will the issue of germ warfare be raised?" A young Canadian reporter told me that before the Chinese and Korean delegations arrived in Montreal, journalists from Western capitalist countries had mostly received instructions to try to probe the content of the Chinese and Korean proposals. The reporters privately discussed and worried that: "The proposals brought by the Chinese and Korean delegations will be like miniature atomic bombs for Mr. Charles Marshall!"

    There is no need to reiterate the eighteen-day conference. Charles Marshall and his entourage released a smokescreen of "no politics" at the meeting in order to prevent the delegations of the Soviet Union, China, Korea, and other people's democratic countries from raising proposals concerning the prohibition of atomic bombs, condemning the US military for violating the Geneva Convention by massacring prisoners of war and peaceful Korean residents, and conducting germ warfare, all related to the future of mankind, but these conspiracies all failed. In many cases, Mr. Marshall's last weapon—the "voting machine"—also failed. In the face of all Red Cross delegates with a sense of justice, the American imperialists nakedly exposed themselves as the main culprits in destroying the International Red Cross Charter and trampling on humanity. The influential bourgeois newspaper *The Globe and Mail* in Toronto lamented: "The Communists lost the vote, but won the propaganda!"

    What is called winning the propaganda! That is the indelible truth!

    At a time when the American invading troops in Korea were constantly massacring prisoners of war, and American plutocrats were greatly expanding their germ factories in the United States and Canada's Grosse Île for profit, and when "atomic mania" was spreading from the United States to Canada, the delegations of the Soviet Union, China, Korea, and other people's democratic countries were holding high the banner of humanitarianism in Toronto. The peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union not only wants to "alleviate human suffering," but also to eliminate human suffering.

　　万里赴会记
    ——多伦多纪行之一
    吴文焘
    编者按：本报将陆续发表《多伦多纪行》的几篇通讯。这是作者随我国出席第十八届国际红十字大会代表团前赴多伦多时所写的。其中报道了许多关于加拿大和其他资本主义国家的情况。因此虽然收到较迟，仍不减它的意义。
                送别
    七月二十二日傍晚，我随着出席第十八届国际红十字大会的中国代表团，在布鲁塞尔换上比利时“萨贝那”公司的四引擎客机，要在夜里飞过北大西洋。刚刚听到几声热情的招呼：“同志们，劳动光荣！”飞机的门就砰然关闭了。
    那是捷克斯洛伐克驻比利时公使馆工作同志们的声音。他们用了捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民最亲切的祝贺语向代表们告别。在马达咆哮声中，我听不清机舱里代表们在讲些什么，看样子，大概是些感激的话。
    从晌午离开了热情的布拉格，谁也没想到，在千里以外的比利时京城，又有捷克斯洛伐克驻比公使奥布赫烈达尔同志带着秘书和随员到机场来欢迎。直到下午六点钟，公使同志因为要参加当晚波兰使馆的国庆宴会而抱歉地向我们告辞了，但是他还指定秘书和随员留下，叮嘱他们一定要等大家上了飞机再走。
    我和做了二十年钢铁工人、脸上还浮着铁红色的使馆随员海都契克同志谈得最久。虽然两个月前他才从祖国休假回到布鲁塞尔来，他却像多年离乡别井似的，殷切地向我打听捷克斯洛伐克各项建设的近况。他在国内的休假期本是一个月，可是，“休息了几天就觉得够了，还是回到炼钢厂去做两星期工吧！”他说：“你知道，我们的社会主义建设总是感到劳动力不足的；同时，把两星期的工资捐给朝鲜人民，不是一举两得吗？”我把这件事告诉了一位同行的朝鲜红十字会代表，他们俩长久地紧紧握手不放。
    在航空站的休息室里，我和一位须发斑白、像个学究似的比利时的老先生有一段不期而遇的谈话。由于他客气地把旁边的座位让给我，我就坐下递给他一枝“中华”牌香烟，顺便谈起来，知道他是布鲁塞尔市郊一个家庭器皿店的经理，在站上等着接女儿。他惊羡这枝香烟的质量，问了价钱，说它比比利时市场上的次等烟还便宜，他不由得流露了些感叹的话：“人们愈来愈买不起东西了。失业的一天天增加。昨天国庆节（按：七月二十一日是一八三一年比利时脱离荷兰自立王室的纪念日），小买卖人们还是照例在市郊大马路上摆摊。摊贩税提高了，可是买的人却少了，人们花一个法郎以前，要在手里掂三下……！”
    我问这位老者：“为什么人们买不起东西？为什么失业的那样多呢？”这问题似乎使他为难了。他看看表，说是女儿所坐的飞机该到了，就把问题扯过去。其实问题是十分明显的，经济危机的乌云，正笼罩着比利时和其他资本主义国家。
            北大西洋之夜
    夜渐渐深了。我们已经到了苍茫的北大西洋上空。飞机不时地颤动，使人难以入睡，只好拿飞机上为旅客准备的各色资产阶级报纸来消磨时间。
    翻翻当天的巴黎《世界报》，首先看到的大标题“法国向美国声明：法国的财政和军事政策，主要决定于（美国军火）定单”，这段新闻说出美国拒绝按照里斯本会议允诺的数额向法国军火工厂定货所引起的严重影响。让美国战争贩子们牵着脖子进行扩张军备的比内内阁，在财政、贸易和社会危机的面前，已在表露难以实现法国在里斯本会议上所承担的武装十二个师的任务。好几家英国报纸的头条新闻，是报道由保守党政府拒绝成百万工人要求增加工资所引起的社会纠纷。那里的问题，也是扩张军备下的财政、贸易和社会危机。
    最耐人寻味的，要算当天伦敦《泰晤士报》的三篇社论。其中一篇，是讲工潮的严重的；一篇是论述对华贸易的，它公开指出在这个问题上“英美意见是分歧的”；另外的一篇，更说明英国和舒曼（实际是美国）计划的矛盾，和六个“舒曼计划国家”间围绕着西德煤、钢竞争和重新武装问题的矛盾……。
    这就是一天的几家西欧资产阶级报纸的主要内容。
    历史是多么尖锐地嘲笑着西欧的反动资产阶级啊！当三、四年前共产党人指出：美国“富翁”们所提出的“马歇尔计划”、“北大西洋公约”和限制东西贸易的政策，将把西欧带到死路去的时候，西欧资产阶级的代言人们说，那是“宣传”，是要“分化西方国家”……而今，共产党人过去讲的话，已为西欧资产阶级的报纸吞吞吐吐地承认了。
    时间一刻一刻地拖过去，东欧已经是早晨九点钟了，我们的飞机还在拔海两万尺的、昏暗的云层之上背着太阳向西飞行。渐渐地，一道霞光从我们的背后的天边上射出来。当我们钻出云雾、在北美纽芬兰岛的甘得尔机场降落时，天还没有亮。
            可耻的“总体防御”
    听说是由于东部美加边境一带有暴风雨，一直等到七月二十三日下午四点，我们才从甘得尔继续西飞，途中经过加拿大第一大城蒙特利尔，午夜二时到达多伦多。从北京算起来，代表们已经走了大半个地球。刚刚在“皇家约克饭店”安顿下来，眨了眨眼，一部分人就去开会了。
    办完了记者“备案”的手续，我翻开七月二十四日的《纽约时报》，才知道作为美国政府出席第十八届国际红十字大会的首席观察员、美国国务院政策室人员查理士·马舍尔先生，已在布置着或者可以叫做总体的“防御”工作，以防备苏联、中国、朝鲜和其他人民民主国家代表团的“攻击”。
    照我的了解：国际红十字大会所宣布的宗旨以及此次大会所要讨论的问题，不过是围绕着维护“人道”和“减轻人类苦痛”等原则的；在这样的问题上诚惶诚恐地防备别人“攻击”，说明一些什么呢？这只能是像中国的俗语所说的“做贼心虚”。当我们还在蒙特利尔航空站等候换飞机的时候，一大群加拿大和美国的记者，就转弯抹角地打听中国和朝鲜代表团在会上提案的内容，他们尤其关心的是：“提不提细菌战问题？”一个加拿大的青年记者告诉我：在中、朝代表团未到蒙特利尔之前，西方资本主义国家的记者们大都接到指示：尽量探测中、朝提案的内容。记者们私自议论和担心的是：“中、朝代表团所带的提案，对于查理士·马舍尔先生来说，都将像个袖珍原子弹呢！”
    用不着重述十八天会议的经过了。查理士·马舍尔和他的随从们，在会上施放“禁谈政治”的烟幕，以期阻止苏、中、朝及其他人民民主国家代表团提出关于禁用原子弹、控诉美军违反日内瓦公约屠杀战俘和朝鲜和平居民，并进行细菌战等有关人类前途的提案，但是这种阴谋都宣告失败了。在不少场合下，马舍尔先生的最后武器——“表决机器”，也告失灵。在一切有正义感的红十字会代表面前，美帝国主义者赤裸裸地暴露了自己是破坏国际红十字章程、践踏人道的元凶。多伦多的有势力的资产阶级报纸《环球邮报》悲叹说：“共产党表决输了，但宣传胜利了！”
    什么叫宣传胜利！那是真理的不可磨灭！
    在美国侵朝军队不停地屠杀战俘、美国财阀们为了利润大大扩充其在美国和加拿大格罗斯岛等地的细菌工厂声中，在“原子狂”从美国传染到加拿大的时候，苏联、中国、朝鲜以及其他人民民主国家的代表团却在多伦多高举着人道主义的旗帜，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营不仅要“减轻人类的苦痛”，而且要消灭人类的苦痛。
