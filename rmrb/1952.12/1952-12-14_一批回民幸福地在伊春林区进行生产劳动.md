    A Group of Hui People Happily Engaged in Production and Labor in the Yichun Forest Area

    To the Editor: We are a group of Hui people who were once insulted as "poor Hui," and "thieving Hui." We once lived through a long series of bitter years with trepidation. Our mosques were once turned into bandit barracks. We know that those unspeakable sufferings were brought to us by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now we are unwilling to mention them anymore. But we want to sing the praises of our happy life today with unparalleled excitement.

    Not long after the Northeast was liberated in 1948, we Hui people living in Harbin responded to the call of the People's Government and participated in the work in the Yichun forest area, and we independently established a "Hui Workers' Team" of more than 70 people. Thanks to the care of the People's Government for our Hui customs, beliefs, and living habits, the number of Hui people participating in the forest area work has been continuously increasing. Now there are already five "Hui Workers' Teams," with more than 500 people. In 1950, the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau built a temporary mosque for us, so that we had a place to celebrate festivals. Our beef and mutton food problem has also been properly resolved. This year, the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau built a larger mosque for us, which can not only provide us with a place to perform regular prayers, but also includes bathing rooms, a religious leader's room, and offices. The local native produce company has specially prepared relevant food and daily necessities for us. In a word, we, like our liberated fraternal ethnic groups, are on the road to happiness. Our happiness and our freedom of religious belief are guaranteed thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    In order to defend our good life and to defend peace, we are determined to cooperate with all the staff and workers in the forest area with practical actions, strive to complete the forestry production tasks, and supply the timber needs for the country's national defense construction and economic construction.

    一批回民幸福地在伊春林区进行生产劳动
    编辑同志：我们是曾经被辱骂为“穷回子”、“贼回子”的一群回民。我们曾经提心吊胆地熬过了一长串苦难的岁月。我们的清真寺曾经变成匪兵的兵营。我们知道那些诉说不尽的苦难，是国民党反动派带给我们的，如今我们已经不愿意再提起了。但我们却要以无比兴奋的心情，来欢唱我们今天的幸福生活。
    东北解放后不久的一九四八年，我们住在哈尔滨市的回民，即响应人民政府的号召，参加了伊春林区的工作，并且单独成立了一个“回民工队”，计七十多人。由于人民政府对我们回民风俗、信仰和生活习惯等等的照顾，参加林区工作的回民不断增加着。到现在已经有五个“回民工队”，计五百多人。一九五○年，伊春森林工业管理局曾经为我们建筑了一座临时的清真寺，使我们有了过节日的地方。我们的牛羊肉食问题，也得到了妥善的解决。今年，伊春森林工业管理局又给我们盖了一座较大的清真寺，除了可以供我们经常做礼拜外，内中还有沐浴室、教长室、办公室等。当地土产公司特别为我们备办了有关的食品、日用品。一句话，我们和解放了的各兄弟民族一样，在向着幸福的路上走。我们的幸福，我们的宗教信仰自由得到保障，都是由于共产党、毛主席的领导。
    为了保卫我们的好日子，为了保卫和平，我们决用实际行动配合林区全体职工，努力完成林业生产任务，以供应祖国国防建设和经济建设的木材方面的需要。    伊春林区回族工作人员    王凤林
