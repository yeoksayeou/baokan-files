Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee convened its Fourth Plenary Session of all members from the 10th to the 12th. This session summarized the work of the Southwest Region over the past year and determined the tasks for the entire region in the future. The meeting also discussed how to implement the decision of the 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee regarding changes in the institutions and tasks of the Greater Administrative Region's regime. Attending the meeting were Southwest Military and Administrative Committee Vice Chairmen He Long, Deng Xiaoping, Xiong Kewu, Liu Wenhui, Wang Weizhou, Song Renqiong, Lu Han, and committee member Zhang Jichun, among other 56 people. Also attending were members of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's finance and economics, culture and education, ethnic affairs, and supervision committees.

Vice Chairman He Long gave a report at the meeting on "An Overview of Work in the Past Year and Future Tasks." He pointed out that land reform and various social reforms in the Southwest Region have been basically completed. This year, the region's agricultural production has completed the task of increasing production by 5% as stipulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been fully opened to traffic, and the Kangzang Highway has also been opened to traffic to Qamdo. Other financial and economic work, industrial production, culture and education, health, and ethnic minority work have also achieved significant results. He proposed that the focus of work in the Southwest Region in the future, under the unified plan of the Central People's Government, is to welcome the upcoming large-scale national economic construction and cultural construction. To this end, it is necessary to continue to deepen the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. In terms of industry, complete production reform, implement economic accounting systems, and strengthen basic construction work; in terms of agriculture, carry out mutual aid and cooperation movements to ensure that agricultural production next year increases by 9% compared to this year. At the same time, cultural and educational work should be strengthened, and all cultural and educational work must be coordinated with economic construction. In addition, political power construction should be further strengthened, and ethnic minority work should be done well.

Vice Chairman He Long proposed at the meeting that in order to adapt to the requirements of large-scale economic construction in the future, the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee should follow the decision of the 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee regarding changes in the institutions and tasks of the Greater Administrative Region's People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee), immediately begin the work of changing and adjusting the institutions, and establish the Southwest Administrative Committee.

At the meeting, Vice Chairman Wang Weizhou, Committee Member Zhang Jichun, and others reported on the achievements of the Southwest Region's ethnic minority work, agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation movements, cultural and educational work, and the major tasks of various provinces and cities over the past year and their future main tasks, respectively.

After group discussions and speeches at the general assembly, the meeting unanimously adopted a resolution, agreeing with the summary of past work achievements and the opinions on future work put forward in Vice Chairman He Long's report.

Finally, Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping made an important speech at the meeting. He said that future economic construction is national, and there must be a national plan and a unified national battle goal. Concentration is one of the basic conditions for construction. Changing the organizational form of the Greater Administrative Region's level of political power institutions is to adapt to the requirements of this situation. In the future, in addition to changing the institutions and tasks of the Greater Administrative Region in accordance with the decision of the Central People's Government, the Southwest Region should strive for proper handling of organizational structure and personnel; at the same time, the Southwest local organizations of various democratic parties and the people of all ethnic groups in the Southwest should further strengthen unity and jointly realize the new work tasks of the Southwest Region.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The People's Governments of Pingyuan and Chahar Provinces in the North China Region have abolished the original provincial establishment in accordance with the "Resolution on Adjusting the Establishment of Provinces and Regions" of the 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee.

    贺龙副主席在会上作了“一年来的工作概况与今后任务”的报告，他指出：西南区的土地改革及各种社会改革已基本完成。今年全区农业生产已完成西南军政委员会第三次全体委员会议所规定的增产百分之五的任务。成渝铁路已全线通车，康藏公路也已通车到昌都。其他财经工作、工业生产、文教卫生和少数民族工作也都获得显著成绩。他提出：今后西南区的工作重心是在中央人民政府的统一计划下，迎接即将开始的全国大规模的经济建设与文化建设。为此，必须继续深入开展爱国增产节约运动。在工业方面，完成生产改革、推行经济核算制、加强基本建设工作；在农业方面，开展互助合作运动，做到明年农业生产要比今年增产百分之九。同时，应加强文化教育工作，一切文化教育工作必须配合经济建设。此外，应进一步加强政权建设，做好少数民族工作。
    贺龙副主席在会上提出：为了适应今后大规模经济建设的要求，西南军政委员会应遵照中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议通过的关于改变大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）机构与任务的决定，立即着手进行机构的改变与调整工作，成立西南行政委员会。

    最后，邓小平副主席在会议上作了重要讲话。他说，今后的经济建设是全国性的，必须有全国计划，全国统一的战斗目标。集中，是建设的基本条件之一。改变大行政区一级政权机构的组织形式就是为了适应这种形势的要求。今后西南区除了根据中央人民政府的决定，改变大行政区的机构与任务外，对于组织机构和人事的处理，都应力求妥善；同时各民主党派西南区地方组织和西南各族人民还要进一步加强团结，共同实现西南区新的工作任务。
