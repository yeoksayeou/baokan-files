Xinhua News Agency: The people of Korea warmly acclaim the great achievements of the World Peace Congress and unanimously express their firm support for the various documents adopted by the Congress, especially the proposals for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary published on the 25th: At this peace congress, the participants unanimously demanded an immediate end to the barbaric war of aggression being waged by the U.S. imperialists in Korea, and solemnly put forward a just plan for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue in the declaration. The Korean people express their warm welcome to this plan.

"Democratic Korea" pointed out in an editorial on the same day: The achievements of the World Peace Congress are enormous, and the declaration passed by the Congress to the people of all countries is a document of profound historical significance. The editorial then described the U.S. interventionists' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea, the spreading of various germ-carrying insects, and the bloody atrocities of massacring our captured personnel day and night on Geoje Island and Bongam Island. The editorial pointed out: The enemy's attempt in creating these atrocities is to destroy the Korean people and expand the war of aggression against Korea. If we do not stop this in Korea today, then these atrocities will appear in another place tomorrow.

The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial said: The World Peace Congress represents the unanimous will of peace-loving people and has put forward a combat program for further promoting the movement to defend peace. Peace cannot be waited for; we must unite and strive for it. The unanimous wish of good people—peace—will surely triumph.

[Xinhua News Agency, 30th] The people of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria warmly hail the great achievements of the World Peace Congress. Poland's "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 24th entitled "Defending Peace is the Cause of All Mankind," saying: The peace representatives of 85 countries participating in the World Peace Congress unanimously voted in favor of international cooperation and peaceful coexistence among all countries. More and more people around the world are increasingly aware that if they stand idly by while their neighbor's house is on fire, the flames will burn their own house. More and more people around the world condemn the American aggressors for spreading death-dealing bacteria, condemn them for killing defenseless prisoners of war, and condemn them for organizing new West German Nazi armies. More and more people around the world are increasingly aware that the struggle to maintain peace is the struggle to maintain life. "People's Tribune" pointed out: At the World Peace Congress, prominent politicians from bourgeois political parties, leaders of various organizations, and communists worked together actively. This diversity of political views among the representatives participating in the conference convinced many hesitant non-partisans and made them believe in the breadth of the peace movement. "People's Tribune" said: The Congress's declaration and the letter to the governments of the five major powers will surely mobilize more and more good people to rise up and defend peace—the most precious treasure of mankind.

In Romania, since the news of the closing of the World Peace Congress came, workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life have written to various newspapers expressing their support for the Congress's resolutions. G. Gheorghiescu, a worker at the No. 5 refinery of the Suro Petroleum Factory, published an article in "Spark" saying: Every word of the World Peace Congress declaration resonates strongly in my heart. This declaration expresses the wishes of every peace-loving person. Whether in the factory or where I live, I will continue to promote the content of this solemn declaration. I will also step up production and complete the 1953 production target ahead of schedule. Some laboring farmers in Bucharest Prefecture wrote: We laboring farmers have experienced the ravages of war, and we cherish peace like we cherish the pupils of our eyes. We believe that the people of all countries can crush the plans of the warmongers. We will strive with our utmost efforts to realize the resolutions of the Congress. The writer Mihail Suburu wrote: The struggle to defend peace must be continued with greater force until the warmongering demons are completely eliminated.

In Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, a mass rally in support of peace was held on the evening of the 24th. G. Nadzhrekov, the head of the Bulgarian delegation to the World Peace Congress, reported on the opening and achievements of the World Peace Congress at the meeting.

    “民主朝鲜”报在同一天的社论中指出：世界人民和平大会的成就是巨大的，大会通过的给各国人民的宣言就是一个有深刻的历史意义的文件。社论接着叙述了美国干涉者对朝鲜和平城乡的滥炸，撒布各种带菌昆虫并在巨济岛、蜂岩岛日夜屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行。社论指出：敌人制造这种暴行的企图在于毁灭朝鲜人民，扩大侵朝战争。如果我们今天在朝鲜不加以制止的话，那么这种暴行在明天就会在另一个地方出现。
