    The Design Company of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Actively Conducts Design for Next Year's Capital Construction Projects

    [This Newspaper's News] The Design Company of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry is actively conducting the design work for capital construction projects in 1953. The construction drawings for standard employee dormitories have been completed, and are now being repeatedly reviewed and checked, and the project budget is being prepared. The technical design of more than ten factory buildings has been completed, and construction drawings are being prepared, with plans to complete them in early next year, so that the construction departments have time to prepare fully and start construction as early as possible. Regarding geological drilling, more than ninety building foundations have been surveyed according to design needs, and geological reports have been submitted. The topographic surveying project completed fourteen sites as early as September this year. The remaining tasks, except for a very few that need to be completed in January next year, will all have topographic survey maps drawn before the end of the year.

    The reason why the design work of the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry can be carried out smoothly is, in addition to the leadership's attention, the main reason is, first of all, the strengthening of the planning of the design work. After receiving the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, the Design Company promptly discusses and studies them, puts forward a preliminary plan for completing the tasks; then, the design team leader, the responsible engineer, and other design personnel, according to the requirements of the leadership and combined with the actual situation, estimate the workload and the required manpower and time to the planning department, and after the planning department checks and agrees, determine the time limit and make a work plan schedule; after the work starts, they supervise and check at any time, and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, the standard employee dormitory design team felt that the manpower was insufficient in the middle of the work, so it drew several technicians and draftsmen from other teams to support it, ensuring that the task was completed on schedule.

    Secondly, the designers overcame the passive waiting mentality and actively collected information from relevant units. For example, the information collected from units such as the Machinery Bureau regarding the specifications and supply of hardware and electrical equipment provided a more practical basis for the design; the phenomenon of sitting indoors and designing, resulting in non-compliant specifications and the inability to buy materials, can be avoided. For example, before the design of standard employee dormitories began this year, the Design Company sent people to a machinery factory in Harbin to solicit opinions from the employees on the dormitories built by the company's design department. The shortcomings pointed out by the employees regarding the dormitory design, such as the isolation of the bathroom from the toilet, the odor from the toilet seeping through the bathroom and the poor sound insulation of the housing affecting rest, have become important information for the company to improve the dormitory design this year.

    Thirdly, geological drilling, topographic surveying, and design work have been closely coordinated. In the past, some projects were surveyed by the company itself, but because the coordination was not good enough, they often did not meet the design requirements, or they did not know which design project was needed after the survey was completed, which affected the progress of the design work. This year, the view that geological drilling and topographic surveying serve the design has been clearly established. After undertaking a design project, the design department first puts forward the required conditions and deadlines to the geological team or the surveying team; the geological team or the surveying team, according to the design requirements and their own capabilities, carry out the work in order of priority and urgency. The company also took the initiative to contact the design commissioning units, sign geological drilling or surveying contracts, and send survey personnel to the site for work in a timely manner. Therefore, the design work this year was basically not affected by waiting for survey data.

    Fourthly, in order to ensure the quality of the design, the company implemented a "joint review" system in addition to the general review of each design project, that is, all the design drawings of a building (including architecture, structure, water and heating, electrical lighting, etc.) are fully laid out, and the responsible engineer, the project leader, the foreman of the work type, and the main person in charge of the design jointly review, check, and sign for responsibility. This can avoid the phenomenon of disconnection or mutual contradiction.

    In addition, the company has also received guidance from Soviet experts in the design work, and has made improvements in technology. For example, in lighting design, in the past, it was generally calculated according to the ratio of window area to floor area; after learning the Soviet lighting standards, it was designed according to sunshine, climate, and other conditions.

    Now the employees of the company's various design teams, drilling and surveying teams, and laboratories are working hard, and they unanimously stated: They will definitely ensure quality and complete the design work on schedule.

### 中央人民政府重工业部设计公司  积极进行明年基本建设工程设计

    中央人民政府重工业部设计公司
    积极进行明年基本建设工程设计
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部设计公司，正积极进行一九五三年度基本建设工程的设计工作。标准职工宿舍的施工图纸已全部完成，现正反复审核、检查，并着手编制工程预算。十余处工厂厂房的技术设计已完成，正在绘制施工图，并计划在明年初完成，以便各修建部门有时间进行充分的准备，及早施工。关于地质钻探工作，已根据设计需要勘察了九十余处建筑地基，并提出了地质报告书。地形测量工程早在今年九月份就完成了十四处，现有任务除极少数需在明年一月完工外，都将在年前绘制出地形测量图。
    重工业部设计公司的设计工作之所以能够顺利开展，除了领导方面的重视外，主要的原因，首先是加强了设计工作的计划性。设计公司接到上级所布置的任务后，就及时进行讨论研究，提出完成任务的初步计划；然后由设计工程组组长、专责工程师等设计人员，根据领导方面的要求，结合实际情况，估计出工作量和所需的人力与时间交计划部门，经计划部门检查同意后，确定期限，制出工作计划进度表；工作开始后随时督促检查，发现问题及时解决。如标准职工宿舍设计组，在工作进行中间感到人力不够，即由其他小组抽出技术员、制图员多人前去支援，保证了这一任务按期完成。
    其次，设计人员克服了消极等待的思想，主动地到有关单位搜集资料。例如到机械局等单位搜集的关于五金电器器材规格及供应情况的资料，使设计有了更加实际的依据；那种坐在屋内设计以致规格不合和买不到材料的现象就可以避免发生。又如今年标准职工宿舍设计开始前，设计公司曾派人到哈尔滨市某机械厂，向职工们征求由该公司设计所盖的宿舍的意见。职工们对宿舍设计所提出的缺点，如浴池与厕所隔绝、厕所臭气透过浴池熏人和住房隔音不好影响休息等情况，都成为该公司改进今年宿舍设计的重要资料。
    第三，地质钻探、地形测量与设计工作作到了密切配合。过去有些工程曾由该公司自己勘测，但是由于配合得不够好，往往不合乎设计要求，或在勘测完成后还不知为那一设计工程所需要的，从而影响了设计工作的进行。今年明确地树立了地质钻探与地形测量为设计服务的观点。在承接一个设计工程后，先由设计科向地质队或测量队提出所要求的条件和期限；地质队或测量队根据设计要求与本身能力，分别先后、缓急，进行工作。该公司并主动和各委托设计单位进行联系，订立地质钻探或测量合同，及时派勘测人员去现场工作。因此，今年的设计工作基本上没有因等勘测资料而影响进度。
    第四，为了保证设计质量，该公司对各项设计工程除进行一般的复查之外，还实行了“会审”制度，就是将一个建筑物的各种设计图纸（包括建筑、结构、水暖、电照等）完全摆出来，由专责工程师、工程负责人、工种组长及设计主要负责人一起审核、检查，并签字负责。这样就可以避免发生脱节或互相矛盾的现象。
    另外，该公司在设计工作进行中，还得到了苏联专家的指导，在技术上有了改进。如采光设计，过去都是笼统地按窗口与地板面积比例计算；学习苏联采光标准以后，就按日照、季候等条件设计了。
    现在该公司各设计小组、各钻探、测量队及试验室等单位职工正在紧张地进行工作，他们一致表示：一定保证质量，按期完成设计工作。
