Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The movement of the American people demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea is continuing to unfold. Trade unions, veterans, and the public across the country are participating in this movement.

The New York "Daily Worker" reported: On November 29th, three recently discharged army soldiers who participated in the Korean War – Al Herlitz of Seattle, Brian Bradley, and Dick Davis of Bellingham – distributed peace ballots to be handed to Eisenhower in the bustling downtown area of Seattle on the Pacific coast, receiving an enthusiastic response. Black veteran Herlitz said, "Everyone I spoke with voted to demand immediate peace in Korea." Preliminary results of the voting showed that 322 Seattle men, women, and youth demanded an immediate end to the Korean War, with only three people opposed. In the nearby cities of Bellingham and Everett, local participants of the Peace Crusade also initiated petition voting, with the results showing the same proportion.

In Los Angeles, members of the South Gate 216th branch of the General Motors Company factory union unanimously voted at a recent meeting to ask the newly elected President of the CIO, Walter Reuther, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the United Automobile Workers, to pressure Eisenhower to demand an immediate ceasefire.

Eighty-eight leaders from religious, scientific, educational, labor, and literary circles jointly sent a letter to the newly elected President Eisenhower, demanding an immediate cessation of the Korean War based on the agreement already reached in the Panmunjom negotiations, and to continue to resolve the prisoner of war issue through negotiations. The letter stated: "We believe that our words represent the opinions of millions upon millions of American people, who agree with us that there must be an immediate ceasefire to end the Korean War... We say again: We should stop the slaughter and continue negotiations." Signatories to this letter included: Moulton, retired Episcopal Bishop of Utah in Salt Lake City; Dr. Carlson of Chicago, Honorary Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago, former President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and former President of the American Psychological Association; historian, writer, and poet Dr. Du Bois; Professor Morrison, atomic physicist from Ithaca, New York; Kronbach, Honorary Professor of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Honorary Chairman of the Jewish Peace Fellowship; Dr. Uphouse of Newport; Reverend Evans, pastor of a church in the Diocese of Chicago; Paul Robeson of New York; Dr. Brewster, lecturer from New York; Harold J. Bass, Methodist pastor and preacher in Korea from Grand Coulee, Washington; writer Fast; Day, Dean of the Church of the Holy Comforter in Topeka, Kansas; and Richardson, Chairman of the National Committee of the American Peace Crusade, among others.

The "Daily Worker" said: The Joint Council of Local 453 of the CIO United Automobile Workers (one of the largest union locals in the industry) sent a telegram to Eisenhower demanding a truce. The telegram was signed by 45 council members representing various shops that make up this mixed local.

Local 1119 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America also called on its members last week to demand that Eisenhower fulfill his promise of peace.

Members of Local 1150 of the General Motors factory in Detroit are distributing chain letters to Eisenhower. This chain letter distribution campaign was initiated by the recent "Save Our Sons Conference" held by families in the American Midwest who have relatives in Korea. The letter to Eisenhower states that millions upon millions of Americans are expecting the slaughter to end for the sake of these young people.

The Department of Social Service of the Methodist Church issued an appeal calling for an immediate end to the Korean War. The appeal was issued by Dr. M'ichael, Executive Director of the Department of Social Service of the Methodist Church. The appeal pointed out: "Every Christian... should make stopping the slaughter in Korea an important social cause for him or her until the slaughter in Korea stops."

    八十八个宗教界、科学界、教育界、工人和文学界的领袖曾联名致函新当选的总统艾森豪威尔，要求立即根据板门店谈判中已经获得的协议停止朝鲜战争，并继续以谈判方式解决战俘问题。这封信里说：“我们相信我们的话代表千千万万美国人民的意见，他们和我们一致认为必须立即停火以结束朝鲜战争……我们再说一遍：我们应该停止屠杀，继续谈判。”在这封信上签名的有：犹他州圣公会退休主教盐湖城的蒙尔顿，芝加哥大学心理学荣誉教授、前美国科学促进学会会长、前美国心理学学会会长芝加哥的卡尔逊博士，历史学家、作家和诗人杜波依斯博士，原子物理学家、纽约州伊萨卡地方的摩里逊教授，辛辛那提希伯莱联合大学荣誉教授、犹太人和平联谊会荣誉主席克龙巴哈，新港的厄普豪斯博士，芝加哥教区教会的牧师伊文思，纽约的保罗·罗伯逊，纽约的讲师布鲁斯特博士，卫理公会驻朝鲜的牧师和布道员、华盛顿州大科马地方的哈罗德·杰·巴斯，作家法斯特，堪萨斯州塔毕卡地方的圣恩教堂的教长戴伊，美国和平十字军全国委员会主席李查逊等人。

    联合电气无线电与机器工会第一一一九分会也在上星期号召它的会员们要求艾森豪威尔履行他的和平诺言。
    底特律的通用汽车工厂的第一一五○分会的会员们正在分发致艾森豪威尔的连锁信，这个分发连锁信运动是美国中西部的一切有亲属在朝鲜的家庭最近举行的“拯救我们的儿子会议”发起的。这封给艾森豪威尔的信说，千千万万的美国人正期望为着这些青年们的利益终止屠杀。
    卫理公会社会服务部发表呼吁书，要求立即停止朝鲜战争。这个呼吁书是由卫理公会社会服务部执行干事麦克迈克尔发表的。呼吁书指出：“每一个基督徒……都应该把制止朝鲜的屠杀作为他或她的一件重要的社会事业，直到朝鲜屠杀停止时为止。”
