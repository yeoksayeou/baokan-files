We Miss the Soviet Comrades
Miao Di Zhao Zhifang
    Thirteen, On the day of worker Lao Liu's sister's wedding, Comrade Darasov attended this lively evening party. He enthusiastically cared about our Chinese customs and habits, and the elderly Uncle Han chatted and laughed with him, filling the room with laughter.
    Fourteen, In the evening, I returned home and was talking to my wife about the amiable Soviet friend—Comrade Darasov attending the party.
    Fifteen, At this moment, a fellow worker suddenly ran over and said: Worker Lao Liu is sick and has been sent to the hospital. I immediately put on my cotton coat and rushed to the hospital. The weather was gloomy, the wind and snow were heavy, and on the road ahead, there was a person vaguely walking towards the hospital in a hurry.

    我们怀念着苏联同志
    苗地　赵志方作
    十三、工人老刘的妹妹结婚那天，达拉索夫同志参加了这个热闹的晚会。他热情地关心着我们中国人的风俗习惯，年老的韩老伯和他谈笑着，逗的满屋笑声。
    十四、晚上我回了家，正在和妻子谈到和蔼可亲的苏联朋友——达拉索夫同志参加晚会的事情。
    十五、这时候忽然工友跑来说：工人老刘闹病送到医院里去了。我马上披上棉衣赶到医院去。天气昏黯，风雪很大，前面的路上，隐隐约约地有一个人急促地往医院走着。
