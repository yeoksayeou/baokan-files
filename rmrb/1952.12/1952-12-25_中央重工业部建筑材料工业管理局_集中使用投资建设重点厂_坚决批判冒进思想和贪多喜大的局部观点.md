    Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Bureau of Building Materials Industry
    Concentrates Investment on Key Factories
    Resolutely Criticizes Adventurist Thinking and Local Views of Greed and Grandiosity
    [This newspaper reports] The Central People's Government's Heavy Industry Ministry's Bureau of Building Materials Industry, in drafting the 1953 basic construction plan, implemented the policy of "concentrating resources to build key factories."
    The Central People's Government's Heavy Industry Ministry's Bureau of Building Materials Industry is responsible for leading the production of building materials such as cement and glass. It bears the responsibility of supplying the national basic construction needs for these building materials, requiring the timely establishment of factories producing these materials before other construction projects commence. When the bureau initially discussed investment targets, it did not fully understand the overall national needs for building materials. Fearing that its construction speed would be too slow to guarantee the needs of large-scale national construction, it drafted a relatively large plan. Later, after the bureau's leaders learned about the national demand for building materials and the state's investment priorities for 1953 at the Heavy Industry Ministry, and also discovered many unreasonable aspects while reviewing the basic construction plans submitted by various units, they followed the principle of concentrating national investment and reduced the number of investment projects in their department by several dozen, reducing the investment amount by more than one-third. The remaining investment was largely concentrated on three of the most important new construction projects: the Cement Mechanical and Electrical Repair Plant and two cement plants near the key areas of national industrial construction.
    Some of the projects that were cut were actually very necessary and reasonable. For example, the Harbin Cement Plant could increase its annual cement production by more than 90,000 tons, equivalent to building a new cement plant, by adding just one more kiln. This was a very economical solution with low investment and high returns. However, in order to concentrate national investment on more important projects, the bureau decided to postpone the construction of this kiln until the following year without affecting the cement supply. The investment in the construction of employee dormitories was also significantly reduced this time. The bureau instructed the factories whose investments were cut to clearly explain to their employees the need to consider the overall situation, allowing brother factories with more crowded living conditions to build dormitories first, while they make do for another year, and to more actively increase production and national income so that the state will have more resources to meet the needs of the employees in the future.
    Some of the projects that were cut were also needed by the state, but the preparatory work had not been done well. For example, the Kunming Cement Plant had not yet identified the source of limestone and the factory site had not been determined. For these projects, the bureau decided to fully prepare for resource exploration and design next year, train construction forces, so that construction can begin in an orderly manner the following year, avoiding serious waste and errors due to hasty construction.
    Some of the projects that were cut did not conform to the overall national plan or had serious principled errors in design. For example, based on the plan proposed by the Southwest Chemical Bureau, the bureau had decided to build a cement plant in Guangyuan County in northern Sichuan. Two years ago, it was reasonable to build a plant here to supply the needs of building the Tiancheng Railway. However, the Southwest Chemical Bureau failed to make timely preparations, so the machinery has not yet been secured. If this factory starts construction next year, the Tiancheng Railway will be completed by the time it is finished. Therefore, the construction of this factory is not necessary at present. Secondly, based on the proposal of the Southwest Chemical Bureau, it was originally decided to establish a glass factory with an annual output of 400,000 cases of glass in Ziliujing, utilizing the natural gas there to reduce costs. However, Ziliujing is far from the industrial construction area, transportation conditions are very poor, and there is no large amount of pure quartz locally. This means that the bureau did not carefully consider the purpose of building such a factory, who the products would be sold to, and whether the main raw materials were guaranteed. In addition to these two projects that were erroneous in planning, the Southwest Chemical Bureau also requested the state to allocate funds to expand the Sichuan Cement Plant in Chongqing. When the director of the bureau requested approval of the plan from the higher authorities, he said: "There are no problems with any of the construction projects of this factory. As long as you give me the money, I guarantee it will be completed next year." However, after the Bureau of Building Materials Industry reviewed their design, it found many unreasonable aspects and it was fundamentally impossible to "guarantee completion." In this design, in order to accommodate the use of the existing old machinery of the Sichuan Cement Plant, a grinding mill capable of grinding 10.5 tons of slag per hour was paired with a dryer capable of drying 5 tons of slag per hour. In order to make this grinding mill compatible with the dryer, a 450-horsepower reducer would also need to be installed. However, this machine cannot be manufactured domestically, so this project cannot be completed within the next year. For example, the wharf conveying equipment project required skirt conveyors, but they could not even provide the specifications of this machine. The river level fluctuates, so a floating wharf must be built. They could not design this type of wharf themselves, so they requested the higher authorities to approve the hiring of a foreign engineer to design it. After the foreign engineer arrived, he said that to build this wharf, a 1,000-meter-long canal must first be dug along the riverbank. However, excavating this canal would require 700,000 cubic meters of earthwork alone, and the labor costs for earthwork alone would be 40 to 50 billion yuan. Regarding the design of the quarry, the Chemical Bureau originally wanted to use a 100-horsepower diesel engine to simultaneously drive an air compressor and a stone crusher. When the higher authorities pointed out that a 100-horsepower diesel engine could not drive these two large machines, they added a generator and two electric motors. The factory was already very crowded, but they planned to expand it from an annual output of 60,000 tons of cement to 200,000 tons. When the higher authorities asked them how the factory would be laid out, whether the water source and product storage area were sufficient, and whether the construction force was sufficient, they could not answer. In short, the Chemical Bureau did not consider the overall situation when making expansion plans. The emergence of this phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that some leading cadres and technical personnel of the Chemical Bureau do not have sufficient understanding of the complexity of basic construction, are satisfied with the achievements of restoring the factory, have not well summarized the past basic construction experience, and have not recognized the national requirements for basic construction today. For example, the director of the Chemical Bureau believes that basic construction is just building houses and installing machines; design is just "drawing a gourd according to a gourd" based on old machines; and if a machine is missing, just "order" it from abroad according to the specifications of the old machine. In a word, "As long as you give me the money, everything is no problem." After listening to Minister Wang Heshou's report at the factory director's meeting, he only felt that there would be "large-scale" construction in the future and was very excited. He then planned to build and expand those factories in the Southwest, but did not understand the spirit of the report, which said that "we must concentrate resources to build important projects of decisive significance." When the higher authorities decided to cut the above investments, he showed extremely unpleasant emotions. After returning to Sichuan, he even called the person sent by the General Bureau to make the plan, saying: "Let the central government do the factory construction work in the Southwest itself." In order to correct this adventurist thinking and local views of greed and grandiosity caused by a lack of experience, the Heavy Industry Ministry and the leading cadres of the Bureau of Building Materials Industry have repeatedly and patiently persuaded and educated them, pointing out the serious harm of this erroneous thinking, resolutely denying these erroneous plans, and ordering the Southwest Chemical Bureau to first fully prepare for the key engineering plan as stipulated by the state next year.
    In addition, the bureau decided not to use state investment for some repair projects that cost little and are necessary for the production of various factories, but to use the technical measures fees of the factories to solve them.
    Although the bureau's basic construction investment has been reduced so much, the state's requirements for the bureau's products in 1953 have not been reduced, that is, the production targets have not changed. According to this requirement of the state, the factories of the bureau have all prepared the 1953 production plan according to the average advanced quotas of 1952. The Liulihe Cement Plant, because it combined the increase production and practice economy movement when ordering the plan, mobilized employees to discuss it, and the 1953 index exceeded this year's average advanced quota (this year's average advanced quota is 6.45 tons of cement per hour, and the 1953 plan reached 7 tons), and made practical and reliable technical organization measures to ensure the completion of this plan.

    中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局
    集中使用投资建设重点厂
    坚决批判冒进思想和贪多喜大的局部观点
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部建筑材料工业管理局在编制一九五三年基本建设计划时，贯彻执行了“集中力量建设重点厂”的方针。
    中央人民政府重工业部建筑材料工业管理局负责领导水泥、玻璃等类建筑材料的生产。它担负着供应全国基本建设对这些建筑材料的需要的责任，需要及时把生产这类建筑材料的工厂在其他建设工程施工前建立起来。该局在开始讨论投资指标时，由于不了解国家对建筑材料的全盘需要情况，唯恐自己建设的速度慢了，难以保证国家大规模建设的需要，所以计划就订得比较大些。后来，该局的领导干部在重工业部了解了一九五三年国家对建筑材料的需要量和国家的投资重点，同时在审查各单位提交的基本建设计划时又发现了不少不合理的地方，于是便遵照着使国家投资更加集中使用的原则，把本部门的投资项目削减了几十个，投资额削减了三分之一多，其余的投资则绝大部分集中使用到水泥机电修配厂和接近国家工业建设重点区的两个水泥厂等三项最重要的新建工程上。
    这些削减掉的工程项目中，有些本来是很需要、很合理的。如哈尔滨水泥厂只需再添设一座窑，每年便可增产九万多吨水泥，等于新建一座水泥厂，花钱少而生利大，经济上是很合算的。但是为了使国家的投资能够集中使用到更重要的工程上，在不影响水泥供应的情况下，该局决定将这一个窑推迟到后年再修建。又如对职工宿舍的修建的投资，这次也削减了很多。该局指示这些被削减了投资的工厂，要很好地向职工讲清楚要照顾全局，让比本厂住得更挤的兄弟工厂先盖宿舍，自己先凑合一年，到后年再盖；同时应该更加积极生产，更多地增加国家收入，以便国家今后有更大的力量来满足职工的需要。
    在削减掉的工程项目中，还有一部分是国家所需要的，但是准备工作没有做好。譬如昆明水泥厂，现在连石灰石的矿源还没有查清，厂址还没有确定。对这些工程，该局决定在明年要充分做好资源勘察和设计等准备工作，训练好施工力量，以便在后年能够有条不紊地开工，避免由于仓促施工而产生严重的浪费和错误。
    在削减掉的工程项目中，还有一部分是计划不符合国家全局部署或设计有严重的原则性错误的。例如以前根据西南化工局提出的计划，该局曾决定在四川北部的广元县建设一座水泥厂。两年以前，为了供应修筑天成路的需要，在此处设厂是有道理的。但西南化工局未能及时做好准备工作，因此直到现在机器还无着落。如果这个工厂在明年动工，等到完工时，天成路也要完工了。因此，这个工厂的建设在目前就不必要了。其次，根据西南化工局的提议，原来还决定在自流井设立一个年产四十万箱玻璃的玻璃厂。以利用该处的天然瓦斯，降低成本。但是自流井距离工业建设区很远，运输条件很坏，当地也没有大量纯净的石英。这就是说，该局对盖这样一座工厂的目的是什么，产品销售给谁，主要原料是否有保证，都没有仔细考虑。除了这两个在计划上是错误的工程以外，西南化工局还要求国家拨款扩大现在重庆的四川水泥厂。该局局长向上级请求批准计划时说：“这个工厂的各个工程项目都没问题，只要给我钱，保证明年完成。”但实际上建筑材料工业管理局一审查他们提出的设计，不合理的地方极多，而且根本无法“保证完成”。在该项设计中，为了迁就使用四川水泥厂现有的旧机器，在一座每小时能干燥五吨矿渣的烘干机上配了一座每小时能磨碎十吨半矿渣的磨。为了使这个磨适应烘干机，还要配上一座四百五十马力的减速机。但这个机器国内不能制造，因而这项工程明年内是无法完成的。再如码头输送设备工程需要裙式输送机，但他们连这种机器的规格都提不出来。江水有涨有落，必须做活动码头，对这种码头自己不会设计，他们就呈请上级批准，请了一位外国工程师来设计。这位外国工程师来后一看，说要修这座码头，先要在江边开一条一千公尺长的运河。但是开这条运河仅只挖土方就要七十万方，仅土工工资就要四五百亿元。关于采石场的设计，该化工局原来要用一部一百马力的柴油机同时带动空气压缩机和碎石机两部大机器。当上级指出一部一百马力的柴油机不可能带动这两部大机器的时候，他们便又添上一台发电机和两台电动机。原来这个厂就很挤，他们却计划要从年产六万吨水泥扩大至二十万吨。当上级询问他们工厂如何通盘布置，水源和产品储存面积够不够，建筑力量够不够……时，他们都回答不出来。总之，该化工局在做扩大计划时，就没有从全盘考虑。这种现象的产生，主要是由于该化工局的某些领导干部和技术人员对基本建设的复杂性认识不够，满足于恢复工厂时的成绩，没有很好地总结过去的基本建设经验，没有认清今天国家对基本建设的要求。譬如该化工局局长认为基本建设就是盖房子，安机器；设计就是照着旧机器“照葫芦画瓢”；缺什么机器，只要按照旧机器的规格向外国一“订”就行了。一句话，“只要给钱，一切都没问题。”当他听了王鹤寿部长在厂矿长会议上的报告之后，只觉得今后要“大规模”建设了，感到非常兴奋，便筹划着本单位要在西南建设和扩大那些工厂，而没有领会报告中“必须集中力量建设有决定意义的重要工程”的精神。当上级决定削减上述各项投资时，他便表现了极不愉快的情绪。回四川后，他还打电话给派来总局做计划的人，表示：“西南的建厂工作交中央自己去干吧。”为了纠正这种由于缺乏经验而产生的冒进思想和贪多喜大的局部观点，重工业部和建筑材料工业管理局领导干部曾对他们反复地耐心地进行说服教育，指出这种错误思想的严重危害，坚决地否定了这些错误的计划，责成西南化工局，明年要按照国家规定的重点工程计划，首先充分做好准备工作。
    此外，还有一些花钱不多而又为各厂生产必需的修补工程，该局则决定不动用国家的投资，利用各厂的技术措施费去解决。
    该局的基本建设投资虽然削减了这样多，但国家一九五三年对该局产品的要求却未减少，即是说，生产指标并未改变。根据国家这一要求，该局所属各厂都按一九五二年的平均先进定额编制了一九五三年的生产计划。琉璃河水泥厂，由于在订计划时结合增产节约运动，发动职工进行了讨论，一九五三年的指标更超过了今年的平均先进定额（今年的平均先进定额是每小时产六点四五吨水泥，一九五三年的计划达到了七吨），并且做出了保证这一计划完成的切实可靠的技术组织措施计划。
