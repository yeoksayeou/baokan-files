The North China region's agricultural patriotic production increase campaign has victoriously concluded this year. The achievements of this movement have laid a good foundation for large-scale agricultural economic construction in the entire region next year.

This year, in the agricultural patriotic production increase campaign in various parts of North China, efforts were made to implement the policy of increasing yield per unit area, combining the focus on cultivating high-yield model examples with striving for large-area bumper harvests. As a result, the region's harvest reached a new historical level, demonstrating the great prospects for agricultural production. The former Chahar province, which had suffered from natural disasters for years, saw its total agricultural output this year exceed the pre-war normal output by 19.4 percent. Suiyuan province, which had a lower level of farming technology, also saw its total grain output this year exceed that of the pre-liberation period (1949) by 15 percent. The cotton production of Hebei, Shanxi, and the former Pingyuan provinces all exceeded the highest pre-war levels this year. There were large areas of bumper harvests; according to statistics from 28 counties in Shanxi Province alone, there were 5,967 units achieving them; among them, Pingding County had 32 bumper harvest villages, 11 bumper harvest agricultural production cooperatives, and 491 bumper harvest mutual aid teams. A large number of high-yield records emerged in various places. In the former Pingyuan province, only Zhang Tushu had a millet yield of 1,022 catties per mu last year, while this year there were 40 units with millet exceeding 1,000 catties per mu. In Shanxi Province, 54 units broke the highest national unit area yield records for certain crops last year; Qi County's Wangcun achieved an all-round bumper harvest of autumn fields, with an average yield of 489 catties per mu.

This year's agricultural patriotic production increase campaign in North China had the following characteristics:

The emergence of agricultural production cooperatives in North China and their role as guiding lights provided farmers with role models for progress and increased production. The 11 agricultural production cooperatives in Pingding County, Shanxi Province, achieved an average yield of 500 catties per mu on 1,716 mu of land this year, more than double last year's output, 71 percent higher than the average mutual aid team this year, and 118 percent higher than individual farmers. The fact that cooperatives had higher yields than teams, and teams had higher yields than individual farmers, was a common occurrence in the summer and autumn assessments in various places.

Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various parts of North China took the lead in learning from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union and actively promoting agricultural science and technology. Many areas implemented close planting for crops such as cotton, millet, corn, and sorghum. In the southern part of Shanxi Province, close planting of cotton accounted for 80 percent. The bumper harvest millet of the Wang Jiabin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaoxizhang Village, Shexian County, Hebei Province, had twice as many plants per mu as ordinary farmers, and the yield exceeded that of ordinary farmers by 2.5 times.

After being organized, farmers in various parts of North China are using collective strength to carry out basic agricultural construction and change the face of nature. In terms of water conservancy construction, by the end of September, the entire region had expanded the irrigated area by 10,437,000 mu by digging canals, sinking wells, digging ponds, and building dams, which is more than double the expanded irrigated area last year. Constructive land improvement (including soil improvement and repairing embankments) reached more than 5.5 million mu in Shanxi Province alone. Farmers in the former Pingyuan Province purchased 7,000 new-style walking plows and more than 19,000 sprayers this year. Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangjiazhuang, Licheng County, Shanxi Province, built new canals and repaired old ones, freeing 99 mu of land from drought and flood, and also built five embankments, improving 39 mu of soil; under the cooperative's leadership, the entire village repaired a canal that can irrigate more than 400 mu of land. Extensive mountainous areas have paid attention to the combination of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Ren Qingmei, a labor model in Yetaochuan, Wu'an County, Hebei, led 26 villages in the entire Chuan to close mountains for afforestation of 1,788 mu this year, plant large areas of forests of 258 mu, and plant more than 190,000 trees; the number of livestock has also increased significantly; agricultural production has also achieved a bumper harvest, with 59 households achieving bumper yields of more than 1,000 catties per mu of corn alone.

Based on the improvement of patriotic awareness, the broad masses of farmers in North China have extensively formulated patriotic production increase plans; this has transformed the national agricultural production plan into the farmers' own plans and actions, ensuring the successful completion of the region's grain, cotton, and other production increase tasks this year. At the same time, many advanced groups (cooperatives) have formulated long-term production and construction plans. In Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province alone, two-thirds of the villages and one-third of the mutual aid teams have formulated three- to five-year production and construction plans. After democratic discussion, all the farmers in Baiyangyu Village, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, formulated a five-year construction plan for ten major changes in the entire village, requiring that the yield per mu be doubled within five years.

Currently, provinces in the North China region are holding or preparing to hold agricultural labor model conferences to systematically summarize this year's production increase experience and welcome large-scale economic construction next year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    今年华北区农业爱国增产竞赛运动胜利结束
    今年华北区农业爱国增产竞赛运动已胜利结束。这一运动所取得的成果，为明年全区大规模农业经济建设奠定了良好基础。
    今年华北区各地在农业爱国增产竞赛运动中，努力贯彻了提高单位面积产量的方针，使重点培养高额丰产典型与争取大面积丰产相结合，结果全区收成达到了新的历史水平，显示了农业生产的伟大远景。连年遭受自然灾害的原察哈尔省，今年农业总产量已超过战前常年产量百分之十九点四。耕作技术水平较低的绥远省，今年粮食总产量也已超过解放前（一九四九年）百分之十五。河北、山西和原平原等省今年棉花产量均已超过战前最高水平。大面积丰产，仅山西省二十八个县统计，就有五千九百六十七个单位；其中平顺县有三十二个丰产村、十一个丰产农业生产合作社、四百九十一个丰产互助组。各地都涌现出大量的高额丰产纪录，原平原省去年仅有张图书一人每亩谷子收一千零二十二斤，今年就有四十个单位的谷子每亩超过一千斤。山西省突破去年全国某些作物单位面积产量最高纪录的有五十四个单位；该省祁县王村的秋田全面丰收，每亩地产量平均达到四百八十九斤。
    今年华北区农业爱国增产竞赛运动有以下几个特点：
    华北区由于农业生产合作社的出现并起着指路标的作用，使农民有了前进的榜样和增产的榜样。山西省平顺县十一个农业生产合作社，在一千七百一十六亩土地上，今年获得平均每亩五百斤的收成，超过去年产量的一倍多，超过今年一般互助组百分之七十一，超过单干户百分之一百一十八。在产量上、社比组高、组比单干户高，是各地夏、秋评比中的普遍事实。
    华北区各地农业生产合作社、互助组带头学习苏联先进生产经验，积极推广农业科学技术。很多地区棉花、谷子、玉米、高粱等作物都实行了密植。山西省南部地区密植棉花占到百分之八十。河北省涉县小西?村王家彬农业生产合作社的丰产谷子，每亩株数比一般农民多一倍，产量超过一般农民二点五倍。
    华北区各地农民在组织起来后，正以集体力量展开农业基本建设，改变自然的面貌。在水利建设方面，截至九月底为止，全区开渠、打井、挖池、修坝等共扩大浇灌面积一千零四十三万七千亩，相当于去年扩大的浇灌面积一倍以上。建设性的修整土地（包括改良土壤、修堰垒堎），仅山西省就有五百五十多万亩。原平原省农民今年已购买新式步犁七千部、喷雾器一万九千多架。山西省黎城县王家庄董桃气农业生产合作社开新渠、修旧渠，使九十九亩地免除了旱涝，还修堰五道，改良土壤三十九亩；在该社带动下，全庄修渠一道，可浇地四百多亩。广大山区已注意农、林、畜牧相结合。河北武安县冶陶川劳动模范任清美，带动全川二十六个村，今年封山育林一千七百八十八亩，大片造林二百五十八亩，植树十九万多株；大量增添牲畜；农业生产也得到丰收，单是玉米每亩收千斤以上的丰产户就有五十九户。
    华北区广大农民在爱国主义觉悟提高的基础上，广泛地订立了爱国增产计划；这就使国家农业生产计划变成了农民群众自己的计划和行动，保证了今年全区粮、棉等增产任务的完满实现。同时，各地不少先进组（社）已订出长年生产建设计划，仅山西省长治专区就有三分之二的村庄、三分之一的互助组订下了三年到五年的增产建设计划。山西省昔阳县白羊峪村全体农民经过民主讨论，订出了全村十大变革的五年建设计划，要求作到每亩产量在五年内增加一倍。
    目前华北区各省正在召开或准备召开农业劳动模范大会，以系统地总结今年增产经验，迎接明年大规模的经济建设。    （新华社）
