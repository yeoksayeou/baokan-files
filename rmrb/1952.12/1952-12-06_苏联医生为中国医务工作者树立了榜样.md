    Soviet Doctors Set an Example for Chinese Medical Workers

    To the Editor: Anyone who has been treated at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital will be deeply moved by the Soviet doctors' high level of internationalism and their tireless dedication to serving patients. I was hospitalized in the surgical department of the hospital from August 26th. I would like to write about some of the things I learned during my month-long stay in the hospital.

    Professor Vaskrisinsky, the director of surgery and a Soviet expert, is an elderly man of about sixty. His actions deeply impress people that he and his work have become one. He not only pours his entire spirit into all the patients in the department, but is also frequently asked to consult on difficult and complicated cases or give reports, introducing advanced treatment methods and experiences to our country's medical workers. His spirit of selfless service to patients and his medical approach of "careful diagnosis and thorough preparation" make even a patient who feels pessimistic and uneasy about their condition feel completely confident and at ease knowing that he will perform the surgery. There is such an example: A comrade surnamed Li from the Baoding Veterans Affairs Bureau was shot in the left leg during the war, causing an arteriovenous fistula at the wound, which affected his heart and caused him great pain. A difficult surgery was required to separate the femoral vein and femoral artery in order to cure him. For many years, he could not find a place to treat it. Recently, he had the opportunity to be treated at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. Professor Vaskrisinsky, the elderly Soviet expert, made careful examinations and thorough preparations, and performed surgery on the patient on September 22nd. Prior to this, the patient's thoughts had once wavered, but under the care and encouragement of the old expert, he finally calmly went to the operating table. The result was good, and recently I heard that the patient is preparing to practice getting out of bed and exercising. During the surgery, the old expert worked tirelessly from 10:00 am to 6:30 pm, without eating or drinking. After the surgery, the old expert also took the time to gather patients in the surgical ward who were able to move around and introduced them to health knowledge. That night, he stayed at the hospital to observe the patient's condition. This kind of work ethic deeply moves everyone. In the short months since the establishment of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, he has cured many patients suffering from difficult and complicated diseases.

    This old expert highly respects the opinions of patients. Let me give an example from my own experience. After I was admitted to the hospital, the hospital decided to operate on me on the afternoon of September 18th. That noon, he invited me to the surgical office and said to me, "According to our custom, once a patient has been notified of the date of surgery, we must fulfill it, no matter what difficulties arise. We had originally decided to operate on you this afternoon, but I have a report that I must give temporarily. If you are willing to have the surgery today, we will definitely respect your opinion; otherwise, we will postpone it until tomorrow." In the past, when I was being treated for illnesses, I always listened to the doctor's instructions; there was never a matter of soliciting my opinion. I was immediately moved and suggested postponing it, and he sincerely thanked me.

    In the surgical department, in addition to the old expert, there is also a Soviet expert, Dr. Dumansky, and eight young Chinese doctors. The entire department is divided into two groups; the two Soviet experts each lead a group, and the old expert oversees the whole thing. The doctors make rounds in groups every day; the entire group of doctors makes rounds together once a week, and also holds multiple briefings to exchange opinions. Whenever there are difficult or complicated cases, before the surgery, the old expert arranges for the doctors to study and discuss in detail, so that everyone understands the condition and studies the surgical methods to be implemented, and finally the old expert makes the decision. When a patient is discharged from the hospital, the expert makes a summary, and the attending physician issues a certificate based on the summary. For example, before operating on me, the doctors held three or four meetings, and the old expert gave detailed instructions. With the old expert's tireless help, these young Chinese doctors have gained a great deal.

    The above is only a small part of the facts I know about one Soviet expert at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital; throughout the hospital, there are countless moving stories. The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is a precious gift of friendship from the great Soviet people to the Chinese people. This hospital not only cures many difficult diseases for the Chinese people, but will also cultivate a group of advanced and excellent doctors for the Chinese people, setting a learning example of medical technology and medical style for the vast number of Chinese medical workers.
                                                                                                    Wang Gulu

    苏联医生为中国医务工作者树立了榜样
    编辑同志：凡是在北京苏联红十字医院治过病的人，都会深深为苏联大夫们高度的国际主义精神和不辞劳瘁为病人服务的医疗作风所感动。我从八月二十六日起在该院外科住院治疗。我愿意把我在住院一个来月中所知道的一些事实写出来。
    外科主任苏联专家瓦斯克里辛斯基教授，一个六十岁左右的老人，他的行动使人深深感到：他和工作已经融合为一体了。他不仅把全副精神灌注在全科病人的身上；并且时常被其他方面约去会诊疑难病症，或做报告，为我国医务工作者介绍先进的治疗方法和经验。他废寝忘食地为病人服务的精神和“谨细诊断、充分准备”的医疗方法，即使一个对自己的病情感到悲观不安的病人，知道由他来动手术，也会完全感到信赖和放心。有这样一个事例：保定荣誉军人管理局一位姓李的同志，过去在战斗中左腿中弹，伤处动静脉交流而成动静脉瘘，影响心脏，痛苦不堪。必须作艰巨的手术，把股静脉和股动脉分开，才能治好。多年来，他找不到治疗的地方。最近，他有机会到北京苏联红十字医院治疗。瓦斯克里辛斯基老教授作了严密的检查和充分的准备，在九月二十二日为病人动手术。在这以前，病人思想曾一度动摇，但在老专家的关怀鼓舞下，终于泰然地上了手术台。结果良好，最近听说病人已准备练习下床运动了。在动手术时，老专家从上午十时到下午六时半，始终紧张地工作着，未进饮食。手术完毕后，老专家还抽空召集外科病房中能够行动的病人，介绍卫生常识。当夜，他留宿医院，观察病人情况。这种工作精神，谁都会深深受到感动。在北京苏联红十字医院成立后短短几个月内，经他治愈的患着疑难病症的病人已经有不少了。
    这位老专家十分尊重病人的意见。就拿有关我自己的一件事实来作例子。我入院后，医院决定在九月十八日下午为我动手术。那天中午，他请我到外科办公室，对我说：“按照我们的习惯，一经通知了病人动手术的日期，无论有什么困难，必须履行。本来决定今天下午替你动手术，但临时有一个报告必须我去。如果你愿意今天动手术，我们一定尊重你的意见；否则，就改到明天。”过去我在治病时，总是听凭大夫支配的；根本没有征求我意见的事。我当即感动地提议改期，他还真诚地向我道谢。
    在外科，除了老专家以外，还有一位苏联专家杜曼斯基大夫，和八个中国青年大夫。全科分两组；两位苏联专家各领导一组，而由老专家总其成。每天大夫们分组查病房；每星期全体大夫会查病房一次，还举行汇报多次，交换意见。每遇疑难病症，在动手术前，由老专家布置，让各大夫详细研究讨论，务使大家了解病情及研究施行手术的方法，最后由老专家决定。病人出院时，由专家作总结，主治大夫根据总结签发证明书。像在为我动手术前，大夫们就开过三、四次会，老专家还专门作了详细指示。在老专家这种诲人不倦的帮助下，这几位年青的中国大夫的收获是很大的。
    以上，仅仅是我所知道的有关北京苏联红十字医院一个苏联专家的很少一部分事实；在全院，动人的事迹是说不完的。北京苏联红十字医院是伟大的苏联人民送给中国人民友谊的、珍贵的礼物。这个医院不仅为中国人民治愈许多疑难疾病；并且将为中国人民培养一批先进的、优秀的医生，为中国广大医务工作者树立了一个医疗技术和医疗作风的学习榜样。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王古鲁
