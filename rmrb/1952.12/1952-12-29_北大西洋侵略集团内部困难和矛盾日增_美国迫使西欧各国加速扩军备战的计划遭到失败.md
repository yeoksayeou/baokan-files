Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Difficulties and Contradictions Within the North Atlantic Aggression Group Increase Daily; US Plan to Force West European Countries to Accelerate Arms Expansion and War Preparations Suffers Failure
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] The North Atlantic Aggression Group Council meeting held in Paris concluded on the 18th after four days of discussion. A vague communique was issued after the meeting. The content of the communique and the information about the meeting revealed by British, American, French, and other news agencies prove that the United States cannot eliminate the paralysis of war preparations in Western Europe, and the difficulties and contradictions within the North Atlantic Group are increasing.
    One of the main issues the meeting had to resolve was how Western European countries could accelerate arms expansion according to the US plan. The United States and the Western European countries in the North Atlantic Group showed extremely obvious differences on this issue. US Secretary of State Acheson and US Commander of the North Atlantic forces Ridgway, who attended the meeting, tried their best to demand that the countries not "relax" their arms expansion work because of difficulties. According to the United Press, the United States "asked its reluctant allies to recognize the cold fact that North Atlantic Treaty military commanders still fatally lack what they need." However, since the United States itself admits that it cannot afford the huge military expenditures, it cannot answer the counter-arguments put forward by Western European countries. Reuters said: Representatives of Britain and other continental countries issued "warnings" at the meeting; "Further increases in military expenditure would seriously endanger the national economy."
    The current situation is: Western European countries say to the United States: Unless you give more money, the plan cannot be completed; the United States says to its Western European "partners": You must put in more effort yourself, otherwise, even the current amount of money cannot be given. It was precisely because of this situation that, after arguing about this main issue, the meeting abandoned the arms expansion target decided at the last meeting held in Lisbon in February this year, under the guise of so-called future arms expansion emphasizing "quality over quantity." The United Press said: The plan to establish seventy-five divisions by the end of 1953 and ninety-six divisions by the end of 1954 has been "formally cancelled." The meeting did not even specify a substitute goal, because, as the US Information Service admitted: "The reconciliation between military needs and economic capabilities is not so close to being completed." The meeting also had to admit in the communique that the arms expansion plan must be based on a "stable economy," which reflects the failure of the United States to exert pressure at the meeting.
    It is worth noting that, just on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting, the so-called "Council of the European Economic Cooperation Administration" also met in Paris and passed an annual report on the 13th, which pointed out that the current European economy has become "rigid" and "outdated." Its main characteristics are: stagnation of production, unstable financial and monetary situation, imbalance of international payments, serious dollar deficit, and stagnation of free exchange work between countries. The New York "Herald Tribune" admitted in its comments on this matter that the United States is facing a "long-standing dilemma." The process and results of the four-day meeting proved this situation of the United States.
    The situation was the same on another important issue to be resolved at the meeting—accelerating the construction of military bases in Western European countries. At the pre-meeting military committee meeting and at the Council meeting itself, the United States tried its best to force Western European countries to implement the plan to build bases with more than 420 million US dollars. However, this request was stubbornly resisted by Western European countries. The US representatives rudely threatened to cut the share borne by the United States at the meeting, and US Secretary of State Acheson even "lost his temper" at the meeting for several hours because of this, but the meeting finally decided to cut the amount requested by the United States by nearly half, and 40% of it still had to be borne by the United States itself.
    The meeting discussed the issue of the European Army, which is the core of the North Atlantic Treaty forces, and decided to quickly pass the European Army treaty. Here, the meeting also encountered irreconcilable contradictions. French Foreign Minister Schuman's speech at the meeting on the 16th showed that the huge losses suffered by France in the colonial war in Vietnam have seriously weakened France's strength. Schuman asked the North Atlantic Group countries to "assist with all their strength" France to complete this colonial war task. The French side stated that unless other countries in the North Atlantic Group share this war, France will not be able to complete the arms expansion plan. In this case, France cannot participate in the European Army, which is bound to be dominated by West Germany. On the other hand, on the eve of the opening of the Council meeting, news from Bonn said that because the European Army treaty in its current form has been seriously opposed, the West German Adenauer government may request to revise the treaty and give West Germany greater rights on the issue of arming Germany. The New York "Times" worriedly stated on the 16th that the contradictions between France and West Germany on the European Army issue make this European Army plan "in danger of collapsing."
    The meeting made a compromise decision on the long-standing dispute between the United States and Britain over command of the Mediterranean. It was decided to appoint Britain's Mountbatten as the Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Mediterranean Fleet, but it was also stipulated that Mountbatten was only responsible for commanding some minor military service tasks. As for the main naval power of the group countries in the Mediterranean, the US Sixth Fleet, it was still under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of Southern Europe of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US's Carney, and Mountbatten was directly under Ridgway's control. According to the Associated Press, this is just a way to "save face" for Britain, "there is no sign that a true unification of command can be achieved."
    The struggle within the North Atlantic Group was also manifested outside the Paris meeting. US Secretary of State Acheson and British Foreign Secretary Eden held two talks outside the meeting on the Iranian oil issue. Acheson asked Eden to quickly resolve the Iranian oil issue. Britain made concessions to the United States and was willing to share the monopoly on the distribution of Iranian oil with the United States, but firmly opposed the method proposed by the United States to use international loans controlled by the United States to pay compensation to Britain by Iran, which in effect meant that the United States would swallow Iranian oil in one gulp. The negotiations therefore failed to yield results.
    The London "Times" was obviously foreseeing this situation, so on the day the Council opened, it gloomily said: "As an institution for political cooperation, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is very fragile at present. This weakness cannot be overcome by establishing a few new committees or holding more meetings by ministers."

### 北大西洋侵略集团内部困难和矛盾日增  美国迫使西欧各国加速扩军备战的计划遭到失败

    北大西洋侵略集团内部困难和矛盾日增
    美国迫使西欧各国加速扩军备战的计划遭到失败
   【新华社讯】在巴黎举行的北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议，经过四天讨论后已在十八日结束。会议结束后发表了一个空泛的公报。公报的内容和英、美、法等通讯社所透露的会议情形证明：美国无法消除西欧备战的瘫痪现象，北大西洋集团内部的困难和矛盾正越来越大。
    会议主要要解决的一个问题，就是西欧国家如何才能按美国计划加速扩军。美国和北大西洋集团中的西欧国家在这个问题上表现了极其明显的分歧。出席会议的美国国务卿艾奇逊和北大西洋军队的美国司令李奇微竭力要求各国不要因为困难而“放松”扩军工作。据合众社说，美国在会上“要求它的不情愿的盟国承认下述冷酷的事实：北大西洋公约军事指挥官仍然致命地缺少他们所需要的东西”。但是，美国既然本身也承认已不胜负担庞大的军备开支，它就无法回答西欧国家针锋相对地提出的论点。路透社说：英国及另外一些大陆国家代表在会上提出“警告”；“再增加军备开支会严重危及国家经济。”
    目前的情况是：西欧国家对美国说：除非你给更多的钱，不然就完不成计划；美国对它的西欧“伙伴”说：你们自己拿出更多力量来，不然连目前这点钱也不能给。正是由于这一情况，所以会议在这个主要问题上争吵了一场之后，在所谓今后扩军要
    “重质不重量”的粉饰下，抛弃了今年二月在里斯本召开的上次会议上决定的扩军目标。合众社说：原订一九五三年底建立七十五个师和一九五四年底建立九十六个师军队的计划已“正式地取消”了。会议甚至未规定出一个代替的目标，因为如美国新闻处所承认的：“军事需要和经济能力之间的调和还不那么接近完成”。会议并且不得不在公报里承认，扩军计划必须以“稳固的经济”为基础，这反映了美国在会议上施行压力的失败。
    值得注意的一件事是：恰恰在北大西洋公约理事会开会前夕，所谓“欧洲经济合作局理事会”也在巴黎开会，并在十三日通过了一个年度报告，其中指出：目前欧洲经济已经“硬化”而“过时”，其主要特征是：生产停滞，财政金融情况不稳，国际收支不平衡，严重的美元赤字以及各国间自由汇兑工作的停顿。纽约“先驱论坛报”在评论这件事时承认：摆在美国面前的是一个“由来已久的左右为难的局面”。四天会议的经过和结果，证明了美国的这种处境。
    在会议所要解决的另外一个重要问题——加速修建在西欧国家境内的军事基地——上，情形也是一样。美国在会前的军事委员会会议上以及理事会本身会议上竭力压迫西欧国家执行以四亿二千多万美元修建基地的计划。它的这个要求却遭到西欧国家的顽强反抗。美国代表在会上粗暴地威胁要削减美国所承担的分额，美国国务卿艾奇逊甚至为此在会上发了几个钟头的“脾气”，但会议最后还是决定把美国所要求的数目削减了将近一半，并且其中百分之四十仍须由美国自己来承担。
    会议讨论了作为北大西洋公约军队核心的欧洲军的问题，并决议要迅速通过欧洲军条约。在这里，会议也碰到了无法调和的矛盾。法国外长舒曼在十六日会议上的发言显示：法国在越南殖民战争中遭受的巨大损失，已使法国的力量严重削弱。舒曼在会上要求北大西洋集团国家“以一切力量援助”法国完成这个殖民战争的任务。法国方面表示，除非北大西洋集团其他国家分担这一战争，法国就无法完成扩军计划，在这种情况下，法国就不能参加势必使西德占压倒地位的欧洲军。另一方面，在理事会会议开幕前夕，从波恩传出的消息说，由于在目前形式下的欧洲军条约遭到严重反对，西德阿登纳政府可能要求修改这个条约，在武装德国问题上给西德以更大的权利。“纽约时报”在十六日就忧虑地说到：法国和西德在欧洲军问题上的矛盾，使这个欧洲军计划“有垮台的危险”。
    会议就美英两国间长期争吵的地中海指挥权问题作了一个折衷决定。决定任命英国的蒙巴顿为北大西洋公约组织地中海舰队总司令，但同时又规定蒙巴顿只负指挥一些次要的军事勤务之责，至于集团国家在地中海的主要海军力量美国的第六舰队仍归北大西洋公约组织的南欧总司令、美国的卡涅指挥，而且蒙巴顿还直接受李奇微节制。按照美联社的说法，这不过是给英国的一种“保存面子”的办法，“并没有迹象说明统帅权的真正统一能够实现”。
    北大西洋集团内部的斗争还表现在巴黎会议的会外。美国国务卿艾奇逊和英国外交大臣艾登曾就伊朗石油问题在会外进行了两次谈判。艾奇逊要求艾登迅速解决伊朗石油问题。英国对美国作了让步，愿意与美国分享对伊朗石油分配的垄断权，但坚决反对美国所建议的由伊朗用美国控制下的国际贷款来支付给英国的赔偿费、实际上是由美国一口独吞伊朗石油的办法。谈判因此而未得结果。
    伦敦的“泰晤士报”显然是预感到这种种情况，所以在理事会开幕的那天，就阴沉地说：“作为政治合作的机构来说，北大西洋公约组织在目前是非常脆弱的。这个弱点并不是成立几个新委员会或部长们多开几次会就能克服的。”
