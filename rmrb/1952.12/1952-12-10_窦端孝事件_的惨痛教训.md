The incident in which reactionary element Luo Shilin of Luxi County openly murdered revolutionary cadre Dou Duanxiao fills people with immense grief and indignation. This incident not only tells us once again that the enemies of the revolution are constantly attempting to attack the people, but also exposes the serious situation in which certain Party and government leaders in Luxi County, particularly Mou Meisheng, the secretary of the County Party Committee, completely disarmed themselves politically and lost their revolutionary stance in this incident.

Why was it possible for reactionary element Luo Shilin to blatantly murder a revolutionary cadre within a state organ? Obviously, this is because Mou Meisheng and others have degenerated to the point where they are severely incapable of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and right from wrong. Mou Meisheng and others were aware of Luo Shilin's reactionary history and political situation; they also knew that Luo Shilin had seized a leading position in the county's public health organs and was carrying out destructive activities. However, they did not, or were unwilling to, consider these issues from a political standpoint. What is especially serious is that when the enemy openly murdered revolutionary cadre Dou Duanxiao during the vigorous "Three-Anti" movement, they remained indifferent and unmoved. Mou Meisheng not only failed to raise the alarm, promptly handle the matter, and report it to higher authorities, but shamelessly went to "watch." Can this series of erroneous actions be tolerated? No, absolutely not! Any mass with even a little sense of justice would feel indignant at the inhuman crimes of the murderer Luo Shilin. Yet our "County Party Secretary" Mou Meisheng could watch the counter-revolutionary elements murder our cadre and turn a blind eye. There is every reason to say that Mou Meisheng and others adopted an inexcusable criminal attitude of connivance and support for the crime of reactionary elements murdering revolutionary cadres. They should bear serious political responsibility for this incident!

Secondly, the occurrence of this incident is also due to the fact that the political atmosphere in the Party and government leading organs of Luxi County has become alarmingly thin. At the beginning of the incident, Youth League member Li Runeng repeatedly reported the situation to the County People's Government and forwarded it to the County Committee, but received no support. Many Party members and cadres also made correct suggestions to Mou Meisheng and others before and after the incident, but after Mou Meisheng refused to accept them, they no longer insisted on the struggle. This shows on the one hand that the Party and government leading organs in Luxi County have long lacked democratic life and principled criticism and self-criticism, which has seriously suppressed the enthusiasm and righteousness of the masses, and prevented Mou Meisheng's erroneous attitude from being corrected in time. On the other hand, this also shows that these Party members and cadres still lack a spirit of genuine responsibility to the Party and the people. It is very clear that Yang Chujiang, the chief of the Yiliang Prefecture Health Section, Shao Guanghua, the president of the County People's Court, and Wang Ming, the chief of the Personnel Section of the County People's Government, all personally investigated and dealt with this matter, but they allowed the counter-revolutionary elements who murdered the revolutionary cadres to remain at large. It was not until the Provincial Party Committee investigated the responsibility that a stern decision was made. It is unacceptable that a political incident of such a major struggle between the enemy and ourselves did not trigger a principled struggle to safeguard the interests of the Party in the local organs and Party organizations.

We should learn a painful lesson from this incident, which is: we must never relax our vigilance against the enemy; we must strengthen organization and discipline, and strengthen political and ideological work, and strengthen democratic life and principled ideological struggle within the Party and state organs. Only in this way can we maintain a clear political mind for every cadre and Party member; and only in this way can we correctly implement the Party's policies and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. At the same time, it must be pointed out that Dou Duanxiao consistently persisted in a serious struggle against counter-revolutionary elements and their illegal acts in this incident, and demonstrated a staunch love for the Party and the leader. This excellent revolutionary quality should be a role model for every revolutionary cadre to learn from.

The murderer Luo Shilin should be severely punished; the mistakes of Mou Meisheng and others should also be treated as a political issue and dealt with seriously. It is recommended that the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government promptly handle this incident and inform us of the final outcome of the handling.

    “窦端孝事件”的惨痛教训
    泸西县反动分子罗时霖公然杀害革命干部窦端孝的事件使人感到无比的痛心和激愤。这个事件不但再一次告诉我们：革命的敌人是时时刻刻企图向人民进攻；并且暴露了泸西县某些党政领导干部，特别是中共县委书记牟梅生，在这一事件中完全解除了自己的政治武装、丧失了革命立场的严重情况。
    为什么反动分子罗时霖有可能在国家机关内明目张胆地杀害革命干部呢？很明显，这是因为牟梅生等人已经蜕化到敌我不分，是非不明的严重地步了。罗时霖的反动历史和政治情况，牟梅生等是了解的；罗时霖窃踞该县人民卫生机关领导地位并且进行破坏活动，牟梅生等也是知道的。但是，他们却没有或者是不愿意从政治上来考虑这些问题。尤其严重的是，当敌人在轰轰烈烈的“三反”运动中公开残杀革命干部窦端孝时，他们依然熟视无睹，无动于衷。牟梅生不但没有引起警惕，及时处理并向上级报告，反而无耻地去“观看”。事件发生以后，牟梅生居然不主张逮捕凶手，还说：“冷静些，慢慢处理。”这一连串的错误行为能让人容忍吗？不能，绝对不能！只要是一个稍有正义感的群众，也会对凶手罗时霖这种绝灭人性的罪行感到义愤填膺。而我们的“县委书记”牟梅生却可以看着反革命分子杀害我们的干部而听之任之。完全有理由说：牟梅生等对反动分子杀害革命干部的罪行，在实质上是采取了纵容和支持的不可饶恕的罪恶态度。他们应该对这个事件负严重的政治责任！
    其次，这一事件所以会发生，也正是由于泸西县党、政领导机关政治空气已经稀薄到了惊人的程度。在事件发生之初，青年团员黎汝能曾连续将情况反映给县人民政府并转告县委会，但是没有得到支持。很多党员、干部在这个事件发生的前后也曾向牟梅生等提出过正确的意见，但在牟梅生拒不接受以后，他们也就不再坚持斗争了。这在一方面说明：泸西县党、政领导机关中是长期缺乏民主生活和原则性的批评与自我批评的，以致严重地压抑了群众的积极性和正气，使牟梅生的错误态度未能及早纠正。另方面这也说明了：这些党员、干部还缺乏真正对党、对人民负责的精神。事情非常明显，宜良专署卫生科长杨楚江、县人民法院院长邵光华、县人民政府人事科长王明等都曾经亲自调查处理过这件事，但他们对杀害革命干部的反革命分子却任其逍遥法外。直到省委追查责任时，才作严正处理。对于这样一件重大的敌我斗争的政治事件，在当地机关和党组织中却没有展开维护党的利益的原则斗争，这也是不能允许的情况。
    我们应该从这一事件中接受沉痛的教训，这就是：必须时刻不放松对敌人的警惕；必须加强组织性和纪律性，并在工作中加强政治性和思想性，在党内和国家机关内加强民主生活和原则性的思想斗争。只有这样，才能保持我们每一个干部、党员有清醒的政治头脑；也只有这样，才能正确地贯彻党的方针和政策，进一步巩固人民民主专政制度。同时必须指出：窦端孝在这一事件中，一贯地坚持了对反革命分子及其违法行为的严肃斗争，并表现了对党对领袖的坚贞热爱，这种优秀的革命品质，应该是我们每个革命干部学习的榜样。
    凶手罗时霖应该受到最严厉的惩处；对牟梅生等的错误，也应看作一个政治性的问题来严肃处理。建议中共云南省委和省人民政府迅速处理这一事件，并将最后处理结果告诉我们。
