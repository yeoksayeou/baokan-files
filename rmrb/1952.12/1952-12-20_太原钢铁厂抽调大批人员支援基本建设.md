    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Transfers Large Numbers of Personnel to Support Basic Construction
    The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has transferred more than 65% of its veteran cadres, 50% of its engineering and technical personnel, 200 various business cadres, and 713 skilled workers from production to basic construction departments. On the 8th of this month, the plant held a send-off party for thousands of people. This group of personnel will arrive in Beijing soon to await unified allocation.
    After returning to the plant from the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Factory Director Conference, the responsible cadres of the plant immediately convened administrative cadre meetings, Party member cadre meetings, and plant-wide employee meetings to convey the spirit of the Factory Director Conference. They then organized discussions in all units, and along with 27 cadres drawn from the Party Committee, the Communist Youth League, and the Personnel Section, went deep into each unit to understand ideological situations and help resolve various doubts, striving to ensure that all employees recognized the importance of basic construction and the relationship between the whole and the part. On this basis, the list of personnel to be transferred was determined; and a preliminary list of cadres to be promoted was proposed, adopting the method of soliciting mass opinions, branch discussions, and leadership approval to fill vacancies. At the same time, people were sent to other places to recruit 1,000 technicians and 300 young apprentices with a junior high school level of education, preparing to recruit them all by next spring, and put them into production after a little training.
    In addition to transferring a large number of cadres to support other basic construction units, the plant has also shifted its leadership focus to basic construction, deciding that the plant director and Party secretary should devote more than two-thirds of their energy to leading basic construction. The deputy plant director specifically responsible for basic construction work, as well as the personnel of the Basic Construction Section, Design Section, and Engineering Company, are to be equipped by the beginning of December. In terms of preparatory work, the main focus is on these two items: one is to concentrate efforts on design, striving to complete the design tasks before the end of January; the other is to conduct winter training for 900 basic construction employees, so as to improve their political awareness and technical level during the training period, and put them into construction as soon as spring begins, striving to complete the project before the end of November next year.

    太原钢铁厂抽调大批人员支援基本建设
    太原钢铁厂已从生产中抽调百分之六十五以上的老干部、百分之五十的工程技术人员、二百名各种业务干部和七百一十三名技术工人给基本建设部门。本月八日该厂举行了数千人的欢送晚会。这批被欢送的人员不日即可抵达北京，听候统一调配。
    该厂负责干部自参加中央重工业部厂矿长会议返厂之后，立即连续召开了行政干部会议、党员干部会议及全厂职工大会，传达厂矿长会议的精神。接着即组织各单位普遍展开讨论，并同党委、青年团、人事科中抽调了二十七名干部深入各单位了解思想情况，具体帮助解决各种疑虑，力求全体职工都认清基本建设的重要意义和整体与局部的关系。在此基础上，确定了各类人员的抽调名单；并初步提出了准备提拔的干部名单，采取征求群众意见、支部讨论、领导批准的办法，补充缺额。与此同时，又派人到外地招募一千名技工、三百名高小程度的青年学徒，准备在明春招齐，稍事训练后即投入生产。
    除了抽调大批干部支援其他基本建设单位外，该厂也将领导重心转到了基本建设方面，决定厂长与党委书记均以三分之二以上的精力来领导基本建设。专门负责基本建设工作的副厂长和基本建设科、设计科、工程公司的人员，都要在十二月初配备起来。在准备工作方面，主要抓紧这两项：一项是集中力量进行设计，争取在一月底前完成设计任务；一项是进行九百名基本建设职工的冬季整训，在整训期中把他们的政治觉悟与技术水平提高一步，一开春即投入施工，争取明年工程提前于十一底结束。
