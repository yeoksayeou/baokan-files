    Celebrating the Opening of the Kangding-Changdu Highway

    Comrade Editor: I was very happy to see the news published in the People's Daily on November 27th about the early opening of the Kangding-Changdu section of the Kangzang Highway. For many years, there was no highway on the Kangzang Plateau, not even a flat mule track. The Tibetan people could not improve their lives because of traffic congestion.

    The heroic People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet and, overcoming various difficulties on the icy and snowy Erlang Mountains and Zheduo Mountains, rushed to repair the highway from Ya'an to Garze that had been abandoned by the Kuomintang. Since then, department store trucks loaded with goods have been speeding to the Kangzang Plateau, supplying the Tibetan people with necessities. In the past, it was very difficult for the Tibetan people of Garze to sell local products and exchange them for daily necessities. Now, they can sell local products locally and buy their favorite tea, and they can also exchange their old sheepskin coats for newly made cloth clothes. Now that the Kangzang Highway has been extended to Qamdo, it has further laid the foundation for the future construction of new Kangzang transportation undertakings, which will have a greater role in the development of production and the prosperity of the economy for the Tibetan people.

    This shows that our Tibetan people can only live a happy and fulfilling life under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    庆贺康定至昌都段公路通车
    编辑同志：我看到十一月二十七日人民日报刊登的康藏公路康定至昌都段提前通车的消息后，非常高兴。多少年来，康藏高原上没有一条公路，连一条平坦的骡马路都没有。藏族人民因为交通阻塞，生活不能改善。
    英勇的人民解放军进军西藏，在冰天雪地的二郎山和折多山上，克服种种困难，抢修了国民党废弃的从雅安至甘孜的公路。从此之后，百货公司的汽车满载着物资向康藏高原上奔驰，给藏族人民供应了生活必需品。从前甘孜的藏族人民，卖土产，换日用品，都非常困难，现在在当地即可卖出土产，买回自己所喜爱的茶叶，也可以换下老羊皮袄，穿上新制的布衣。现在，康藏公路又修到了昌都，进一步奠定了今后建设新康藏交通事业的基础，对于藏族人民发展生产，繁荣经济是有更重大的作用。
    这说明我们藏族人民，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能过美满幸福的生活。
