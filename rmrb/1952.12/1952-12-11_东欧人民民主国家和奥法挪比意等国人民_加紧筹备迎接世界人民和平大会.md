According to TASS: The people of Eastern European people's democratic countries and Austria, France, Norway, Belgium, Italy, and other countries are actively carrying out various preparations to welcome the upcoming World People's Peace Congress.

The Hungarian people have written thousands of letters to the World People's Peace Congress, expressing their determination to support the cause of peace. Thousands of athletes participated in the Youth Peace Relay Race. Hungarian youth, having taken the baton from Romanian athletes, have already run half the distance across the country and passed through Budapest on the 8th, heading for the Austrian border.

The Bulgarian people are holding meetings in various places to welcome the upcoming World People's Peace Congress. Newspapers are publishing articles written by scientists, writers, and workers about the Congress. Telyaнова, an advanced worker at the Burkanска Koprina textile factory, wrote in her letter that to pay tribute to the Congress, she guarantees to fulfill 111 percent of her production plan.

National Peace Congresses have recently been held in Poland, Romania, and Albania. Prague held the Czechoslovak National Mothers' Peace Conference. Prior to the National Peace Congresses, peace conferences were held in various cities and regions, and peace supporter meetings were held in factories, manufacturing plants, and rural areas. These meetings vividly demonstrated that the working people of the people's democratic countries deeply recognize their tasks in the struggle for peace, and demonstrated their strong will to strengthen the struggle against war and to defend peace through peaceful labor.

Large-scale rallies were held throughout Austria to elect representatives to attend the World People's Peace Congress. The people of Innsbruck entrusted their representatives to bring their voices against war preparations in western Austria and their demands for an end to the Korean War to the Congress. Many workers, small business owners, clerks, and housewives in Vienna have registered with the Austrian Peace Council, requesting to serve the World People's Peace Congress. The Vienna Peace Committee accepted the requests of the local people and decided to hold a mass rally on the 13th to celebrate the opening of the World People's Peace Congress.

In France, thirty-four provinces, including Seine-et-Oise, Seine-et-Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Vaucluse, and Var, held provincial defense of peace conferences. The people participating in these conferences represented an extremely broad range of social strata, and the conferences elected representatives to attend the World People's Peace Congress. The French Women's Union has convened many gatherings in various districts of Paris and in cities such as Lyon, Marseille, and Nice to celebrate National Mother's Day. These gatherings all supported the convening of the World People's Peace Congress and unanimously condemned the rearmament of West Germany, advocating a peaceful resolution to the German question.

Several prominent Norwegian social leaders, scientists, writers, and artists issued a statement in support of the World People's Peace Congress. The statement pointed out that the World People's Peace Congress will promote mutual understanding between countries and will expand activities to safeguard world peace. Many Norwegian public organizations and trade union organizations have sent representatives to participate in the World People's Peace Congress.

Preparations for Belgium's participation in the World People's Peace Congress are nearing a successful conclusion. The Belgian Peace League announced that it will send more than eighty representatives and alternate representatives to the Peace Congress. The representatives include people of different professions, different political and religious beliefs, including Communists, Socialists, Liberals, Catholics, and non-partisans.

The Italian people have taken concrete actions to protest the Italian government's decision to cancel the passports of Italian representatives attending the World People's Peace Congress and to obstruct their participation in the Congress. A statement from the Italian National Peace Council said that the Italian delegation to the World People's Peace Congress was elected at thousands of gatherings in residential areas and peace conferences in ninety provinces. The delegation includes more than two hundred representatives, including members of parliament from various parties in the upper and lower houses, leaders of various parties, priests and business people, trade union leaders and prominent cultural workers. This authoritative delegation should express the Italian people's desire for peace at the World People's Peace Congress. Italian citizens expressed surprise and indignation at the government's unprecedented and arbitrary violation of democracy, and protested the government's blatant infringement of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. The Italian people have taken actions to express their anger and protest, and the peace movement has become even more intense. Following the peace rally held in forty districts of Rome on November 30, provincial peace conferences were held in twenty-two cities in Italy on the 6th and 7th of this month. Several factories in the province of Livorno and factories in the province of Aquaria have called for protest strikes.

    东欧人民民主国家和奥法挪比意等国人民
    加紧筹备迎接世界人民和平大会
    据塔斯社讯：东欧各人民民主国家和奥地利、法国、挪威、比利时、意大利等国人民正积极进行各项筹备工作，迎接即将开幕的世界人民和平大会。
    匈牙利人民已写了几千封信寄给世界人民和平大会，表示他们拥护和平事业的决心。有几千名运动员参加了青年和平接力赛跑。从罗马尼亚运动员手里接过接力跑短棍的匈牙利青年已经跑过全国一半的路程，并在八日经过布达佩斯去奥地利边境。
    保加利亚人民在各地举行会议，迎接即将来到的世界人民和平大会。各报都刊登了科学家、作家和工人写的关于大会的文章。伯堪斯加·可普利那纺织工厂的先进工人特莱娅诺娃在她的信中写道：为了向大会致敬，她保证要完成生产计划的百分之一百一十一。
    在波兰、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚，最近都举行了全国和平大会。布拉格举行了捷克斯洛伐克全国母亲和平会议。在全国和平大会召开以前，各个城市和各个地区举行了和平会议，各工厂、制造厂和农村举行了和平拥护者大会。这些会议生动地表明：各人民民主国家的劳动人民深切地认识到他们在争取和平斗争中的任务，并表明他们将以和平劳动来加强反对战争、保卫和平的斗争的坚强意志。
    奥地利各地举行了盛大的集会，选出参加世界人民和平大会的代表。音斯布鲁克的人民嘱托代表把他们反对奥地利西部的备战活动和要求结束朝鲜战争的呼声带到大会去。维也纳的许多工人、小商人、职员和家庭妇女们，都到奥地利和平理事会登记，请求为世界人民和平大会服务。维也纳和平委员会接受当地人民的请求，决定在十三日举行一次群众大会，庆祝世界人民和平大会的召开。
    在法国，塞纳—瓦斯省、塞纳—马恩省、穆尔时—摩塞尔省、瓦克卢斯省、瓦尔省等三十四个省，都举行了全省保卫和平大会，参加这些大会的人代表着极其广泛的阶层，大会选出了出席世界人民和平大会的代表。法兰西妇女联盟曾在巴黎的各区和里昂、马赛、尼斯等城市召开了许多集会，庆祝全国母亲节。这些集会都拥护世界人民和平大会的召开，并一致斥责重新武装西德，主张和平解决德国问题。
    挪威著名的社会领袖、科学家、作家和艺术家多人发表了一项拥护世界人民和平大会的声明。声明指出世界人民和平大会将促进各国间的互相了解并将扩大维护世界和平的活动。挪威的许多公共团体和工会组织已选派代表参加世界人民和平大会。
    比利时筹备参加世界人民和平大会的工作即将胜利结束。比利时和平联盟宣布：将派遣八十多名代表和列席代表出席和平大会。代表中有不同职业、不同政治和宗教信仰的人士，有共产党人、社会党人、自由党人、天主教徒和无党无派人士。
    意大利人民纷纷以具体行动抗议意大利政府注销参加世界人民和平大会的意大利代表的护照、阻挠代表参加大会的决定。意大利全国和平理事会的声明说：参加世界人民和平大会的意大利代表团，是在居民区的几千次集会和九十个省的和平大会上选出的。代表团包括二百多位代表，其中有上院和下院各党派的议员，各党派的领袖，神父和商业界人士，工会领袖和著名的文化工作者。这个权威的代表团应该在世界人民和平大会上表达意大利各阶层人民要求和平的意愿。意大利公民对于政府的这种违反民主的史无前例的专横行为表示惊异和愤慨，并对政府公然侵犯宪法所保证的基本自由，提出抗议。意大利人民纷纷以行动表示他们的愤怒和抗议，和平运动已更趋高涨。罗马的四十个区十一月三十日举行和平集会之后，意大利的二十二个城市中，又在本月六日和七日举行了省的和平大会。里窝那省的几家工厂和阿奎亚里省的工厂已号召举行抗议罢工。
