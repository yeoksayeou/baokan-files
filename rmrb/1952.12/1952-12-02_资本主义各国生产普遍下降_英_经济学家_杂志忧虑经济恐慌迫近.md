Xinhua News Agency: This year, the production of capitalist countries has generally declined, a situation that has widely aroused concern among the bourgeoisie in countries like the United States and Britain about the approach of economic panic.

The British "Economist" magazine provided a typical example of this concern on October 25th. After analyzing the current decline in production in the capitalist world, the magazine pointed out that this decline in production is occurring at a time when many capitalist countries are fully expanding arms production and artificially stimulating domestic inflation.

The "Economist" magazine summarized the production decline in various capitalist countries, saying that in the first half of this year, the production of the capitalist world has decreased by almost three percent. In Western Europe, production has decreased by almost four percent, and the rate of decline tends to continue to increase in the second quarter. Although Britain's industrial production once rose in the first quarter, it suddenly dropped by eight percent in the second quarter. Production in the United States had been declining slowly in the second half of last year, and continued to decline at a faster rate in the first half of this year, with the second quarter down more than four percent from the last quarter of 1951. The output of the five countries of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and West Germany, which participated in the Western European Coal and Steel Community, was slightly higher in the second quarter of this year than in the first quarter, but still one percent lower than in the last quarter of 1951, and the downward trend in production is continuing.

The "Economist" magazine went on to point out the more dangerous actual situation behind this general index of economic activity. It said that in the year between June 1951 and June 1952, so-called "defense production" was maintained, while civilian production declined "quite sharply." Retail sales in Europe and the United States have also declined since the first quarter of last year.

### 资本主义各国生产普遍下降  英“经济学家”杂志忧虑经济恐慌迫近

    资本主义各国生产普遍下降
    英“经济学家”杂志忧虑经济恐慌迫近
    据新华社讯：今年上半年资本主义国家的生产普遍下降，这种情况已在美英等国资产阶级中广泛引起关于经济恐慌迫近的忧虑。
    十月二十五日英国“经济学家”杂志提供了这种忧虑的一个典型例子。该杂志在分析当前资本主义世界生产衰落的情况后指出：这种生产的下降是发生在许多资本主义国家全力扩充军备生产、人为地刺激国内通货膨胀的时候。
    “经济学家”杂志综述了资本主义各国生产下降的情形，它说，今年上半年中，资本主义世界的生产几乎下降了百分之三。在西欧，生产几乎下降了百分之四，而下降的速度在第二季中且有继续增加的倾向。英国的工业生产虽然在第一季一度上升，但在第二季却骤然降低了百分之八。美国的生产去年下半年已有缓慢的下降，而今年上半年则以一个更为迅速的速度继续下降，今年第二季较一九五一年最后一季降低了百分之四强。参加西欧煤钢联营的法、意、荷、比、卢五国与西德在今年第二季的产量虽然稍高于第一季的产量，但仍较一九五一年最后一季低百分之一，而且生产下降的趋势也是持续着的。
    “经济学家”杂志接着指出在这种笼统的经济活动指数后面更加危险的实际情况。它说：在一九五一年六月至一九五二年六月这一年中间，所谓“国防生产”是保持着的，下降得“颇为剧烈”的是民用生产。而在去年第一季之后，欧洲和美国的零售量也都降低了。
