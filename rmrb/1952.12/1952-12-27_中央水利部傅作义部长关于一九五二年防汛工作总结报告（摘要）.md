At the 163rd Executive Meeting of the Central People's Government Government Administration Council on December 19th, Fu Zuoyi, Minister of the Central Ministry of Water Resources, delivered a summary report on the 1952 flood prevention work. The abstract of the report is as follows:

The rainfall across the country during this flood season was uneven. Before July, some local areas in provinces such as Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang experienced heavy rain, while most areas in North China, East China, Central South China, and Northwest China experienced drought. After July, Hubei, Shandong, the former Pingyuan Province, and parts of Hebei Province continued to experience prolonged drought; Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangsu experienced heavy rain due to typhoon influence. The Yangtze and Han River basins experienced particularly heavy rainfall in September. Some tributaries of the Huai River also experienced relatively large floods and waterlogging due to concentrated rainfall. Dongting Lake experienced some large embankment breaches due to a severe storm. However, thanks to the achievements of China's water conservancy construction over the past three years and the efforts of the people across the country in flood prevention this year, the total number of affected farmland this year was only equivalent to 78% of last year and less than one-seventh of that in 1949.

This year's flood prevention work was still carried out under the leadership of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, based on the principle of relying on local authorities and the masses. Party and government leaders at all levels personally took charge of this work. Some areas, in order to combine flood prevention with drought resistance, overcome complacency, and unify leadership over the masses, established flood prevention and drought resistance headquarters. With the assistance of the postal and telecommunications departments, flood reporting work was also strengthened compared to last year. The number of flood reporting stations nationwide increased to 895, of which 279 reported water conditions directly to the central government by telegram. Flood forecasting was also piloted on major rivers.

The flood situation and flood prevention situation in various regions this year are as follows: The Pearl River rose earliest, but mostly did not exceed the danger level. The Yellow River experienced eight flood peaks in July and August. There were four dangerous sections, but no problems occurred after emergency repairs. The Yangtze River experienced more than ten major dangers since the beginning of the flood season, but no breaches occurred after rescue. The Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, rose more than ten times this year. From September 5th to 11th, the entire basin experienced widespread rainfall, and two major flood peaks occurred in the middle and lower reaches. More than 300 dangerous sections occurred one after another, all of which were rescued. Finally, due to the prolonged period, a breach occurred at Huangxinchang in Mianyang County at 2:00 AM on September 12th, flooding more than 400,000 mu of land. Except for the areas in the upper reaches of the Huai River that have not yet been rectified and where breaches occurred, no breaches occurred in the dikes of the main stream and the dikes of the tributaries in the middle reaches. The completed reservoirs and lake depressions for flood storage in the upper reaches have all stored water, which has played a certain role in reducing flood peaks and mitigating floods. The Chengdong Lake in the middle reaches did not release water this year due to the Runheji diversion sluice, protecting 500,000 mu of farmland. In the past, the Menghe depression was a vast expanse of water during the flood season, but this year 140,000 mu of land achieved a bumper harvest. Su County and Fuyang prefectures, however, suffered from waterlogging due to unresolved drainage problems. In addition, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu in East China suffered disasters in some areas due to the impact of huge typhoons. Dongting Lake had not been repaired for many years during the reactionary rule, and a sudden severe storm occurred in late August, flooding 240,000 mu of land in Xiangyin, Yiyang, and Yuanjiang counties.

From this year's flood prevention work, we have realized that eliminating floods is still a long and arduous process.

In terms of flood defense, there are still many urgent tasks. For example, the Han River channel is narrow and cannot accommodate large floods, and disasters may occur at any time. There are also some rivers, such as the Yellow River, the Daqing River and Ziya River in Hebei, and the Liao River in Northeast China, where fundamental treatment projects are urgently needed. Before these rivers' fundamental treatment projects are completed, only temporary flood diversion measures can be taken. However, the control of flood diversion is relatively difficult.

This year's waterlogging disasters account for a prominent position in the national flood disasters. Reducing waterlogging is more difficult than controlling floods in some areas because waterlogging affects a large area rather than a single line. To solve this problem, in addition to river dredging, it is also necessary to combine it with drought resistance work, mobilize the masses, and develop ditches, ponds, and weirs in a planned and guided manner. In excessively low-lying areas, lakes should be appropriately used to collect rainwater for use in the dry season.

In this year's floods, mountain flood disasters also accounted for a large proportion. To reduce the disasters of mountain floods, we should combine the development of old base areas and the development of mountainous areas' production, and promote soil and water conservation work in mountainous and plateau areas on a large scale. According to the survey by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, 1.2 billion tons of topsoil are lost to the Yellow River every year in the upper reaches. This is a major loss to agricultural production in mountainous and plateau areas, and it also adds a lot of difficulties to our fundamental treatment of rivers.

The above two tasks are long-term tasks, but they must be started immediately to gradually solve the problems.

From this year's flood prevention work, we have also realized that flood forecasting for various rivers plays a great role in taking the initiative in flood prevention, and it should be further strengthened in the future. Rainfall observation data is necessary for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and transportation. If this work is listed as one of the tasks of local work in various places, with one rainfall station set up in each district of each county, the foresight of flood prevention and water control can be greatly strengthened.

The dike drilling work created by the Yellow River is very effective in strengthening the strength of dikes. According to the report of the experiment in Guangdong, it proves that it is also applicable to the southern region. This work should be further promoted.

    中央水利部傅作义部长关于一九五二年防汛工作总结报告（摘要）
    中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长，在十二月十九日中央人民政府政务院举行的一百六十三次政务会议上，作了关于一九五二年防汛工作的总结报告。报告摘要如下：
    今年汛期全国各地雨量是不匀调的。七月以前，广西、江西、浙江等省局部地区曾降暴雨，而华北、华东、中南、西北多数地区又呈旱象。七月以后，湖北、山东、原平原省和河北省一部分地区，仍长期未降透雨，发生旱灾；浙江、福建、江苏则因受台风影响，发生暴雨。长江和汉水流域，九月份雨量特大，淮河的一部分支流，亦因雨水集中，发生较大洪水和涝灾。洞庭湖因遇大风暴，曾有一些较大的垸堤发生溃漫。但是，由于三年来我国水利建设的成就和今年全国人民防汛的努力，今年受灾农田总数只相当去年的百分之七十八，不及一九四九年的七分之一。
    今年的防汛工作，仍然是在中央防汛总指挥部领导之下，根据依靠地方、依靠群众的方针进行的。各地都由党政负责同志亲自掌握这一工作。有些地区为了结合防旱，克服麻痹大意、统一对群众的领导，成立了防汛、防旱指挥部。在邮电部门的帮助下，报汛工作也比去年加强。全国报汛站增至八九五处，其中直接向中央电报水情的有二七九处。主要河流也试行了洪水预报。
    今年各地的汛情与防汛情况是：以珠江涨水最早，但多未超出危险水位。黄河在七八月间发生八次洪峰，曾发生四处险工，经抢护未生问题。长江从入汛以来，曾发生重险十余处，经抢救，没有溃决。长江的支流汉水，今年涨水十次以上，九月五日至十一日全流域普遍降雨，中下游发生两次巨大洪水峰，先后发生险工三百余处，均曾抢护脱险，最后因时间持续过久，九月十二日晨二时在沔阳县黄新场决口，淹地四十余万亩。淮河除去上游尚未进行整理的地方发生决口外，干流堤防和中游支流的堤防，都未发生溃决。上游已完成的水库和湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，都已蓄水，对减低洪峰减轻水灾起了一定作用。中游城西湖因有了润河集分水闸，今年未放水，保护了五十万亩农田。濛河洼地，往年汛期汪洋一片，今年十四万亩土地得以丰收。宿县、阜阳两专区，则因雨水排泄问题，尚未完全解决，内涝成灾。此外，华东区的福建、浙江、江苏因受巨大台风的影响，一部分地区成灾。洞庭湖因在反动统治时期多年失修，八月下旬，又突然发生巨大风暴，湘阴、益阳、沅江三县淹地二十四万亩。
    从今年的防汛工作中，我们体会到：解除水患还是一个长期艰巨的过程。
    在防御洪水方面，还有许多急迫的任务。比如汉水河槽狭窄不能容泄较大洪水，随时可能发生灾害。另外还有一些河流，比如黄河、河北的大清河、子牙河、东北的辽河等，治本工程都迫不可缓。对这些河流，在治本工程未完成前，只能采取临时分洪的办法。而分洪的掌握是比较困难的。
    今年内涝的灾害在全国水灾中占突出的地位，减除涝灾，在有些地区却比控制洪水更加困难。因为内涝是一片，而不是一条线。要解决这个问题，除去河流疏浚以外，还必须和防旱的工作相结合，发动群众，有计划、有领导地广开沟洫塘堰，过于低洼的地区，要适当地利用湖泊，借以蓄集雨水，供干旱季节使用。
    今年的水灾中，山洪灾害所占的比量也很大。要减少山洪暴发的灾害，应该结合发展老根据地和发展山区生产的方针，大规模地推广山陵高原地区的水土保持工作。根据黄河水利委员会的调查，黄河上游的表土流失，每年流至黄河去的有十二万万吨。这对山陵高原地区的农业生产是重大的损失，对于我们进行河流治本，也增加不少困难。
    以上这两种工作都是长期的工作，但是现在必须立即开始，才能逐步解决问题。
    从今年防汛工作中我们还体会到：各河洪水预报，对防汛工作争取主动作用很大，今后还应继续加强。雨量观测的资料为农林、水利、交通各方面所必需。假如把这项工作列为各地地方工作的任务之一，各县每一区设一雨量站，则防汛和治水的预见性必可大为加强。
    黄河所创造的堤防钻探工作，对加强堤防强度功效很大。根据在广东试验的报告，证明对南方地区亦可适用。这一工作还应继续推广。（新华社）
