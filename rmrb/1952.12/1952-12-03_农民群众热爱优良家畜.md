    Peasants Love Superior Livestock

    Editor: In the work of promoting superior livestock breeds, we have seen the enthusiastic situation of mountain farmers improving their livestock.

    The LingShou County breeding station in Hebei Province bought twenty-three high quality Corriedale rams in July of this year. At this time, the sheep breeding season had already passed, but the herdsmen from various places still actively drove the ewes that had not been mated to the breeding station for mating. In less than two months, 455 sheep were mated. Under the government's call and promotion, the county's farmers have purchased breeding livestock and bred livestock in large numbers. According to statistics, farmers in the county purchased a total of eighteen breeding livestock in half a year.

    The farmers' love for superior livestock can be seen from an agricultural exhibition. In order to promote this work, the LingShou County People's Government added a livestock and poultry exhibition hall to the agricultural exhibition, displaying Corriedale rams, Yorkshire boars, Leghorn chickens, Chinchilla rabbits, as well as stallions, stud donkeys, and young mules. Because this new content was added to the agricultural exhibition, more and more farmers visited, and the livestock and poultry exhibition hall was packed. The visiting masses praised the superior breeds. Therefore, I hope that all regions will pay attention to this work and meet the farmers' requirements for improving livestock. Zhu Chuanji

    农民群众热爱优良家畜
    编辑同志：我们在推广优良牲畜品种的工作中，看到了山区农民热烈改良家畜的情况。
    河北省灵寿县配种站今年七月买到二十三只优良品种克力黛种羊。这时羊的配种时间已经过去，但是各地放牧工人还是积极地把没有交配的母羊赶往配种站配种，不到两个月时间，就交配了四百五十五只。在政府号召和推动下，这个县的农民群众纷纷自购种畜和大量繁殖牲畜。据统计，全县农民在半年内共添购种畜十八头。
    从一个农业展览会上可以体会出农民热爱优良牲畜的心情。灵寿县人民政府为了推广这项工作，在农业展览会中加添了家畜家禽展览馆，陈列了克力黛种羊、约克夏种猪、莱亨鸡、勒其拉咖啡色兔和种马、种驴、小骡驹等。由于农业展览会中增加了这个新内容，参观的农民越来越多，家畜、家禽展览馆被挤得水泄不通。参观的群众对优良品种都很赞赏。因此我希望各地都要重视这个工作，满足农民改良牲畜的要求。　朱川济
