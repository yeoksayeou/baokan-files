    Shandong Rubber Factory No. 1
    Improves Technology, Increases Production, and Saves a Large Amount of Wealth
    Under the assistance of Soviet rubber experts, the state-owned Shandong Rubber Factory No. 1 has been continuously improving its operating techniques, thereby increasing production and saving a large amount of wealth for the country. In July of last year, Soviet rubber experts Linkov, Alexander, Neigreikin, and Chabasnik, etc., came to the factory and helped solve many design and technical difficulties, and introduced advanced experiences such as repairing vulcanizing bladders, direct adhesion of cord fabric to rubber, raw rubber plastication, and shortening the vulcanization time of automobile tires. Vulcanizing bladders are rubber-made hollow bladders, which are important tools used in steaming tires. In the past, the factory scrapped many vulcanizing bladders, resulting in a great waste. After veteran worker Hu Kuanxiao and others learned the repair methods taught by the Soviet experts, they repaired more than 2,000 discarded vulcanizing bladders that had been accumulated for many years and reused them, saving the state 7.2 billion yuan. Cord fabric is essential for making tires. The advantage of implementing the direct adhesion of cord fabric to rubber method is that it can save processes and gasoline used for mixing rubber. After the workers in the factory's No. 1 tire-making workshop used the direct adhesion method of cord fabric to rubber, they saved the state 9 billion yuan in half a year. After the raw rubber goes through the process of raw rubber plastication, it is easier to mix with other raw materials when manufacturing products.
    In May and October of this year, Soviet experts Alexander, Neigreikin, and Chabasnik came to the factory twice again to help the factory improve the method of brushing the tire tread. The adhesion of the tread rubber and the cushion layer (i.e., the layer between the tread and the cord fabric layer) of the tires produced in the No. 2 tire-making workshop has increased from being able to withstand a pulling force of 20 kilograms to being able to withstand 40 kilograms. In the past, the appearance of the tires was affected due to poor design. This problem has also been solved with the help of Soviet experts, thus greatly improving the quality of the tires. In addition, Soviet experts have made significant contributions to the factory's improvement of safety equipment. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the factory specially established an office to introduce Soviet advanced experience, leading the factory's workers to study Soviet advanced experience in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to continuously improve product quality.

    山东橡胶总厂第一厂
    改进技术增产节约大量财富
    国营山东橡胶总厂第一厂在苏联橡胶专家的帮助下，不断地改进操作技术，因而为国家增产节约了大量财富。去年七月，苏联橡胶专家林可夫、亚历山大、涅依格里金和查巴斯尼克等来到该厂，帮助解决了很多设计和技术上的困难问题，并介绍了修补硫化囊、帘布直接贴胶法、生胶素炼和缩短汽车轮胎硫化时间等先进经验。硫化囊是一种用橡胶制成的空囊，它是蒸轮胎时用的重要工具，该厂过去报废的硫化囊很多，浪费很大。老工人胡宽孝等学会了苏联专家教给他们的修补方法以后，就把积存多年的两千多条废硫化囊修补好，重新使用，给国家节约了七十二亿元。帘布是做轮胎必不可少的东西，实行帘布直接贴胶法的好处，是可以节省工序，节省拌橡胶用的汽油。该厂第一制胎场职工使用帘布直接贴胶法后，半年就给国家节约了九十亿元。橡胶经过生胶素炼的过程，在制造产品时就容易和其他原料混合。
    今年五月和十月，苏联专家亚历山大、涅依格里金、查巴斯尼克又先后两次到该厂，帮助该厂改进了刷胎面的方法。第二制胎场所出产的轮胎，胎面胶和缓冲层（即胎面和帘布层中间的一层）的附着力，从原来可以承受二十公斤的拉力提高到可以承受四十公斤。过去因为设计不善而影响到轮胎的外形，这个问题在苏联专家的帮助下也得到解决，因而大大改进了轮胎的质量。此外，苏联专家对于该厂改进安全设备也作了重大的帮助。在“中苏友好月”中，该厂特地成立了介绍苏联先进经验的办公室，领导全厂职工有计划有步骤地学习苏联先进经验，以便不断地提高产品质量。（新华社）
