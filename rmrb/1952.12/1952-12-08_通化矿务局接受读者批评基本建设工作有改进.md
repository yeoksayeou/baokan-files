Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

    Tonghua Mining Bureau Accepts Readers' Criticism, Basic Construction Work Improved
    Editor Comrade: The criticism of our bureau's neglect of basic construction made by Comrade Zhang Yong in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on October 27 is correct. We humbly accept these opinions and are currently strengthening organizational leadership and correcting our mistakes.

    The reason why our basic construction work was in a state of chaos was mainly because we did not place basic construction work in a primary position ideologically. We only conducted general communication and education among cadres at all levels, asking everyone to change the view of only focusing on production and not construction. In actual work, however, there were only arrangements and a lack of specific inspection. As a result, some middle-level leading cadres had departmentalism and did not transfer stronger cadres and workers to the basic construction department. Now, we have criticized these cadres and transferred stronger cadres to the basic construction department. The organizational structure of the Party, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League are also being gradually strengthened. Now, there is a Party committee member specifically responsible for the Party work in basic construction. The Basic Construction Company was officially established on October 16.

    In order to learn from past lessons and do a good job in next year's construction work, we are now concentrating all our efforts on preparing for next year's basic construction work. We are determined to make a perfect plan before the end of the year to meet the large-scale economic construction tasks of next year.

### 通化矿务局接受读者批评基本建设工作有改进

    通化矿务局接受读者批评基本建设工作有改进
    编辑同志：十月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的张勇同志对我局忽视基本建设的批评，是正确的。我们虚心接受这些意见，目前正在加强组织领导，纠正错误中。
    我们的基本建设工作，所以陷于混乱状态，主要是因为我们思想上没有把基本建设工作放在首要地位，在各级干部中，只进行了一般的传达和教育，要大家扭转只顾生产不管建设的看法，在实际工作中，却只有布置，缺乏具体检查。因而，一部分中级领导干部，有本位主义思想，未把较强的干部和工人调往基本建设部门。现在，我们已对这些干部进行了批评，把较强的干部调到基本建设部门。党、工会、青年团的组织机构，也在逐步加强，现在有一个党委委员专门负责基本建设中的党的工作。基本建设公司已于十月十六日正式成立。
    为接受过去教训，作好明年的建设工作，我们正在集中全力作明年的基本建设准备工作，决心于年前作出完善的计划来，迎接明年的大规模经济建设任务。　通化矿务局
