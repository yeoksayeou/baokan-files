Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th Dispatch: On the night of November 28th, on the Kimhwa front, the Chinese People's Volunteers, with a crack force of twenty-four men, fiercely attacked the enemy's position on Xingshan West Mountain, east of Shangganling, and quickly annihilated the defending enemy's reinforced platoon. That night, after dark, our army's artillery suddenly bombarded Xingshan West Mountain. Before the enemy could figure out what was happening, the twenty-four warriors who had stealthily advanced to Xingshan West Mountain had already charged into the enemy's position under the cover of the artillery fire. The enemy, squatting in the trenches, saw our army coming and hurriedly turned back to crawl into the bunkers, but just as they pulled back the bolts of their rifles, they were met with hand grenades thrown by the warriors. Both the men and the bunkers were destroyed together. While the other enemies did not even have time to fight back, the warriors had already thrown hand grenades into the various bunkers. For a time, the mountain was filled with flashes of light, and the sound of hand grenades exploding was deafening. The enemy's twenty-five bunkers were quickly destroyed. In this attack, the warriors annihilated a total of seventy-five enemies and captured three heavy machine guns, one light machine gun, and three automatic rifles.

     我军二十四个勇士全歼敌军一个加强排
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】十一月二十八日夜里，金化前线中国人民志愿军以一支二十四个人组成的精干部队猛袭上甘岭东面杏亭西山的敌军阵地，将守敌一个加强排迅速歼灭。这天天黑以后，我军炮火突然向杏亭西山轰击起来，敌人还没弄清是什么情况，事先潜行到杏亭西山的二十四位勇士已经在炮火的掩护下冲进敌人的阵地。蹲在交通沟里的敌人看见我军来了，赶紧回头钻进地堡，但当他们刚刚拉开枪拴，就碰上了勇士们投去的手雷，人和地堡都一起毁灭了。当其他的敌人还来不及还手的时候，勇士们已经分头将手雷投向各个地堡。山上一时火光闪闪，手雷的爆炸声响成一片，敌人的二十五个地堡很快就被全部炸毁。勇士们在这次袭击中共计消灭了七十五个敌人。并且缴获了三挺重机枪、一挺轻机枪和三枝自动步枪。
