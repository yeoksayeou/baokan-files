    Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union to Accelerate National Industrialization
    Sha Ying
    Over the past three years, we have achieved great success in learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which has powerfully promoted various construction undertakings. The "economic accounting system" unique to the socialist Soviet Union has been widely implemented in various enterprises in our country, enabling us to realize centralized national planning management, promote the enthusiasm of people's enterprise operations, and thereby powerfully guarantee the accumulation of funds for our country's industrialization. In terms of production in various industrial and mining enterprises, dozens of Soviet advanced experiences of decisive significance have been promoted, such as the "new coal mining method," "high-speed cutting method," "rapid steelmaking method," "rapid maintenance method," "five hundred locomotive kilometers," etc., greatly improving production efficiency and unleashing the potential power of enterprises. Taking the machinery industry department as an example, due to learning the "high-speed cutting method," the production efficiency of various machine tools in our country has generally increased by four to five times, with the highest increase being nearly thirty times compared to the past. In terms of the management of industrial and mining enterprises, due to learning the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "organized and rhythmic production according to instruction charts," the internal operations of enterprises have been able to move in a rhythmic and coordinated manner, gradually overcoming the previous chaotic state of enterprise management, moving towards the track of scientific and balanced production, and greatly improving production efficiency. Significant achievements have also been made in capital construction by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Ma Wenzhi's team at the Fuxin Mining Bureau learned the Soviet "rapid drilling method," which increased drilling efficiency by nearly three times. The Xi'an Mining Bureau used the Soviet well-building method to construct a large-scale vertical shaft, completing the entire project five years and two months ahead of the original plan, with the quality fully meeting the specified standards, saving one million man-hours and reducing costs by 40 percent. Another example is the capital construction project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which, due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, smoothly carried out large-scale winter construction, adding three to four months of operation time each year, greatly accelerating the construction speed of important projects, which is of great significance to our country's industrial construction. In addition, in agriculture, transportation, state-owned trade, and education and health, various tasks have been rapidly developed due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
    Although we have achieved great success in learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and it has already formed a huge material force, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already obtained. We must also admit that there are still many shortcomings in this work that urgently need to be overcome. The most important shortcoming is that the achievements are not consolidated enough. Many Soviet advanced experiences have not been well promoted, and even those that have been promoted are not perfect or widespread enough, and the great role of Soviet advanced experience has not been fully utilized. For example, in July of this year, only 30 percent of machine tools in Dalian City adopted the "rapid cutting method," only 35 percent of machine tools adopted the "multi-tool, multi-blade cutting method," and only 62 percent of machine tools adopted the "high-speed cutting method"; moreover, the machine tools included in the above figures did not always adopt advanced cutting methods, and even those that had only been tried a few times were included. Of course, this is not the only example, and other places have even worse situations, and some production units and capital construction units have not even learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union at all. There is no doubt that this situation is hindering the rapid progress of our construction undertakings and is not allowed to continue.
    So, what are the reasons for the above shortcomings? First, the most important reason is in the leadership. That is to say, the leaders of certain leading organs and certain enterprises do not have enough understanding and importance to learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, lack planning, and do not have timely inspections and summaries, and the leadership methods are generalized. These comrades turn a blind eye to new things, stick to old ways, neither seriously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union nor specifically analyze the situation of their own departments; either they emphasize objective difficulties and lack a strong will, or they simply shout "learn" and "promote" and only stay at the level of general appeals; as a result, the learning and promotion of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is in a state of laissez-faire. Second, some technicians have serious complacency, and in their hearts they still blindly worship the technology of European and American capitalist countries, and regard some outdated and old views as insurmountable regulations, despise the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and learn superficially but not sincerely, divorced from reality and the masses. Thirdly, among some workers, there are also backward ideas, especially they are not proficient in the new technology, feel that the new operating methods are not smooth, and sometimes unconsciously still follow the old habits and use the old operating methods. For example, some bricklayers in Harbin City, although they verbally agreed with Su Changyou's double-handed mud squeezing method and did internships; but sometimes they still used the single-handed mud squeezing method for operation.
    At present, the stage of national economic recovery has come to an end, and a new large-scale economic construction is about to begin. In order to meet this great and arduous task and accelerate the pace of national industrialization, we need to consolidate our existing achievements, overcome existing shortcomings, continue to improve on the original basis, and regard learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as a regular task. In particular, capital construction work has been raised to the primary position in the entire national work, and its task is very important, but our strength is very weak. In order to overcome this main contradiction, in addition to continuing to increase the strength of capital construction with the greatest efforts, actively learning from the advanced experience of Soviet capital construction has become one of the most important tasks of our capital construction department. Facts have proved that whether it is surveying, design, or construction, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the best example for us to learn from.
    In order to better learn and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we should pay special attention to the following tasks. First, we must carry out in-depth ideological education. However, to carry out this work, we must first require our leaders at all levels to deeply understand that the scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union are armed with Marxist-Leninist thought, are the accumulation of rich experience in socialist construction for more than 30 years, and have critically absorbed and integrated all scientific and technological achievements of capitalist countries. Therefore, it is the most advanced and creative in the world, and what we inherited from old China is a dilapidated legacy with backward technology and a lack of talents. Under this circumstance, it is necessary to learn from the advanced science and technology and advanced experience of the Soviet Union to carry out economic construction. Of course, our specific historical conditions are different from those of the Soviet Union, but our country is under the leadership of the working class, and our various economies are under the leadership of state-owned economies with a socialist nature. At the same time, our country will surely move towards socialism in the future, which makes it not only necessary but also possible for us to learn and apply the advanced science and technology and advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Only after our leaders have truly established such a clear understanding can they actively and proactively carry out ideological education for employees in their work. Ideological education is indeed a very important and meticulous task, which not only requires repeated explanations to employees from the perspective of principles, using concrete and vivid examples to patiently persuade them, using the method of cultivating typical examples, establishing banners, and leading the backward with the advanced to lead them, and constantly improving their political consciousness and sense of ownership; but also requires carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and making irreconcilable struggles with all conservative ideas, complacency, empiricism, and bureaucracy. The process of learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is also the process of the struggle between new and old ideas, and the process of advanced ideas overcoming backward ideas. If we relax this ideological education and ideological struggle even slightly, it will undoubtedly harm our construction work.
    Second, there must be a clear and specific plan. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union is very rich. Which advanced experiences do you need to learn and promote in your own department, what key problems do you need to solve, and what goals do you want to achieve? Only when the leadership has a clear direction and knows what is in mind, and has sufficient estimates of the changes within the enterprise that will inevitably be caused by the promotion of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, can they determine the correct plan for learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. That is to say, they must be good at applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to their own specific conditions. Lenin and Stalin taught us that the application of any experience, even one's own experience, must proceed from reality, and must study and analyze the specific environment and historical conditions. To this end, our leaders at all levels must take the lead in seriously studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, deeply understand its basic spirit through independent thinking, truly understand its characteristics and value, and even master it technically, and conduct a thorough investigation and study of the objective situation of their own departments, conduct a concrete analysis, and thus combine the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with the rich experience and genius wisdom of the broad masses, and fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, so that the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can become a priceless treasure for us to promote our work. Our plan must embody this creative spirit. Su Changyou's bricklaying method and Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line method, Yang Dezhong's plastering assembly line method, etc., which have been promoted nationwide and are of great significance to capital construction, are all created by combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with their own specific realities. Facts have proved that where there is a clear plan and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can be applied to its own specific conditions, the actual work there will inevitably progress rapidly. The China Changchun Railway is a typical example. According to the principles of Soviet railway operation and management, it adapted to the actual situation of China and created a set of effective and complete railway operation and management methods, and in just two years, it has indeed achieved excellent results of high efficiency, low cost, and high profit. This is an example worthy of attention in all aspects.
    Third, a series of organizational work must be carried out. After the plan is determined, the leadership must organize forces, stipulate systems, determine methods, seriously implement the plan, and regularly check the implementation and conduct regular summaries, paying attention to rewards and criticisms. Only by carrying out this in a led, organized, and step-by-step manner can the steps of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League be harmonized and consistent, and can it be guaranteed that the plan will be adhered to and implemented from beginning to end. In addition, the leading department should also pay attention to studying the experience of promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, use various forms and methods such as organizing visits, reports, performances, holding symposiums, and running training courses to exchange experience and train backbones, so that the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can be gradually promoted. The scope of promotion can be from point to area, from one factory and construction site to many factories and construction sites, and some can even be promoted to the entire region and the entire country. In this way, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can generate endless power for our construction undertakings.
    It should be pointed out that our conditions for learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union are very favorable now. Because our great ally, the Soviet Union, has sent a large number of excellent experts to directly help us in construction. These talents cultivated by the Lenin and Stalin Party are not only proficient in technology, but also have a high degree of internationalism. They introduce the advanced science and technology and advanced experience of the Soviet Union to us without reservation, and sincerely and selflessly use all means to help us train scientific and technological talents. For example, the Soviet experts of the China Changchun Railway have trained more than 17,000 technicians for us in the past two years, and the famous female train driver Tian Guiying and railway labor models Li Xikui and Wang Jikui are all personally trained by them. Therefore, under their enthusiastic direct guidance and help, our learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is extremely convenient. We should highly respect the suggestions of Soviet experts and learn from them humbly and actively.
    During this "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," a movement to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has been widely carried out in various places. Many business departments have generally checked and summarized the achievements of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in the past three years, and on this basis, they have improved production and work, and new records have emerged, creating good conditions for further learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the future, we must continue to work hard and truly apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to our country's specific conditions, and regard this work as a regular task in order to successfully carry out our country's large-scale economic construction work. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU." The soldiers working on all fronts must follow this instruction, and for the sake of national industrialization, for the sake of building a better future, learn from the Soviet Union and Soviet experts with the greatest enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, turn their experience into our powerful weapons, and use practical achievements to complete our glorious and arduous tasks.

    学习苏联先进经验加速国家工业化
    沙英
    三年多以来，我们学习与推广苏联先进经验是有很大成绩的，已经有力地推动了各种建设事业。社会主义苏联特有的“经济核算制”，已在我国各种企业中广泛推行，使我们实现了国家集中的计划管理，发扬了人民企业经营的积极性，并从而使我国工业化的资金积累得到了有力的保证。在各工矿企业的生产方面，曾推行了数十种有决定意义的苏联先进经验，例如“新采煤法”、“高速切削法”、
    “快速炼钢法”、“快速检修法”、“五百日车公里”等等，大大地提高了生产效率，发挥了企业的潜在力量。仅以机械工业部门来说，由于学习“高速切削法”，曾使我国各种机床的生产效能普遍提高四倍到五倍，最高的较前提高近三十倍。在工矿企业的管理方面，由于学习了苏联“按指示图表有组织有节奏生产”的先进经验，使企业内部能够有节奏地协调动作，逐渐克服了以往企业管理的混乱状态，迈向科学的均衡生产的轨道，使生产效率大为提高。在基本建设中，学习苏联先进经验也获得了显著的成绩。阜新矿务局马文志小组学习了苏联的“快速钻进法”，使钻探效率提高了将近三倍。西安矿务局运用苏联建井方法建设一个规模宏大的竖井，整个工程较原计划提前五年零二个月完工，质量完全符合规定的标准，并节省了一百万个人工，将成本降低了百分之四十。再如鞍山钢铁公司基本建设工程，由于学习了苏联的先进经验，顺利地进行大规模冬季施工，使每年增加三个月到四个月的作业时间，大大地加速了重要工程的建设速度，对我国的工业建设有极大的意义。此外，在农业、交通运输、国营贸易和教育卫生方面，也都由于学习苏联先进经验，而使各种工作得到了迅速的发展。
    虽然我们学习与推广苏联先进经验有了很大成绩，并且已经形成了巨大的物质力量；但是我们不能满足于已获得的成绩，还必须承认：在此一工作中还存在不少亟待克服的缺点，最主要的缺点是成绩还不够巩固，许多苏联先进经验还没有很好的推广，就是已经推广的也不够完美、不够普遍，尚未充分发挥苏联先进经验的伟大作用。例如今年七月份旅大市采用“快速切削法”的只有百分之三十的机床，采用“多刀多刃切削法”的只有百分之三十五的机床，采用“高速切削法”的亦仅有百分之六十二的机床；而且上述数字所包括的机床，还并不是经常都采用先进切削法的，是连仅仅试用过数次的都包括在内。当然，这不是仅有的例子，其他各地还有更坏的情形，甚至有的生产单位和基本建设单位还根本没有学习过苏联先进经验。毫无疑问的，这种情况是阻碍我们的建设事业迅速前进的，是不允许存在下去的。
    那么，产生上述缺点的原因是什么呢？首先，最主要的原因是在领导方面。这就是说某些领导机关和某些企业的领导者，对学习与推广苏联先进经验的认识和重视不够，缺乏计划性，没有及时的检查和总结，领导方法一般化。这些同志对新鲜事物熟视无睹，墨守成规，既没有对苏联先进经验加以认真地钻研，也没有对本部门的情况加以具体的分析；不是强调客观困难，缺乏坚强的意志，就是空喊“学习”“推广”，只停留在一般号召上面；其结果，都使学习和推广苏联先进经验陷于自流的状态。其次，某些技术人员有严重的自满情绪，在内心里还盲目崇拜欧美资本主义国家的技术，把一些过时的陈旧的观点视为不可逾越的法规，轻视苏联先进经验，明学暗不学，脱离实际，脱离群众。再其次，在某些工人中间，也有落后思想，特别是他们对新技术掌握不熟练，感到新的操作方法不顺手，有时不自觉地依然按照旧习惯沿用旧的操作方法。例如哈尔滨市有些工地的瓦工，虽然在口头上赞成苏长有的双手挤浆法，而且作了实习；但有时还是采用单手挤浆法进行操作。
    目前，国民经济的恢复阶段已告结束，新的大规模的经济建设即将开始，为了迎接这个伟大的艰巨任务，加速国家工业化的步伐，需要我们巩固已有的成绩，克服现存的缺点，在原有的基础上继续提高，并且把学习与推广苏联先进经验当作一个经常的工作来做。特别是基本建设工作，已在整个国家工作中被提到首要的地位，其任务十分重大，而我们的力量却十分薄弱，为了克服这个主要矛盾，除了要用最大的努力继续增长基本建设的力量之外，积极学习苏联基本建设的先进经验，便成为我们基本建设部门极为重要的任务之一。事实已经证明，不论勘察、设计和施工，苏联的先进经验都是我们学习最好的榜样。
    为了更好地学习与推广苏联先进经验，我们应当特别重视以下几件工作。第一，要进行深入的思想教育。不过要进行这个工作，首先要求我们各级的领导同志，要深刻地了解：苏联的科学技术是以马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的，是三十多年来进行社会主义建设的丰富经验的积累，并且批判地吸收了和综合了资本主义各国一切科学技术上的成果，所以它是世界上最先进最富有创造性的，而我们从旧中国承继到的则是一份破旧不堪的遗产，技术落后，人材缺乏，在这种情况下进行经济建设，是必须学习苏联的先进科学技术和先进经验的。固然我们的具体历史条件不同于苏联，但我们的国家是在工人阶级领导之下的，我国各种经济是在社会主义性质的国营经济领导之下的，同时我国将来又一定走向社会主义，这就使我们不但必须而且能够学习与运用苏联的先进科学技术和先进经验。只有我们的领导者真正树立了这样明确的认识之后，才能在工作中积极主动地对职工进行思想教育。思想教育工作确实是一件十分重要的细致的工作，这不仅要从道理上对职工进行反复的讲解，用具体的生动的事例去耐心地说服他们，用培养典型、树立旗帜、以先进带动落后的办法去带领他们，不断提高他们的政治觉悟和主人翁的感觉；而且要展开批评与自我批评，和一切保守思想、自满情绪、经验主义和官僚主义作不调和的斗争。学习与推广苏联先进经验的过程，也就是新旧思想斗争的过程，先进思想克服落后思想的过程。如果稍一放松了这种思想教育和思想斗争，那无疑便会损害我们的建设工作。
    第二，要有明确的具体计划。苏联的先进经验是很多的，究竟在你自己的部门中需要学习和推广那些先进经验，要解决什么关键问题，要达到什么目的？只有领导上方针明确，心中有数，对推广苏联先进经验中将必然引起的企业内部的变化有足够的估计，才能确定学习和推广苏联先进经验的正确计划。这就是说要善于把苏联先进经验运用到自己的具体条件下来。列宁、斯大林教导我们说：运用任何的经验，那怕就是自己的经验，都要从实际出发，都要研究、分析具体的环境和历史条件。为此，我们的各级领导同志，都必须带头对苏联先进经验认真地钻研，经过独立的思考，深刻领会它的基本精神，真正懂得它的特点和价值，以至从技术上加以掌握，并对本部门的客观情况加以周密地调查研究，进行具体的分析，从而把苏联先进经验和广大群众的丰富经验与天才智慧结合起来，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，这样才能使苏联先进经验变为我们推动工作的无价之宝。我们的计划，一定要体现这种创造性的精神。现在已经在全国推广的、对基本建设具有重大意义的苏长有砌砖法和谢万福的木工流水作业法、杨德重的抹灰流水作业法等，便都是把苏联先进经验结合自己具体实际而创造出来的。事实证明，那里有明确的计划，能够把苏联先进经验运用到自己的具体条件下来，那里的实际工作就必然会迅速进步。中国长春铁路就是一个典型的例子，他们根据苏联铁路经营管理的原则，适应中国的实际情况，创造了一套行之有效的完整的铁路经营管理方法，在短短两年的时间里，已确实做到效率高、成本低和利润多的优异成绩。这是值得各方面重视的例子。
    第三，要进行一系列的组织工作。在计划确定之后，领导上便要组织力量，规定制度，确定办法，认真地去执行计划，并经常检查执行的情况，定期进行总结，注意奖励和批评。只有这样有领导有组织有步骤的进行，才能使党、行政、工会、青年团的步调和谐一致，才能保证计划自始至终地坚持贯彻。此外，领导部门还要注意研究推广苏联先进经验的经验。例如用组织参观、报告、表演、开座谈会、办训练班等各种各样的形式和办法，来交流经验，培养骨干，以便使苏联先进经验逐步推广。推广的范围可以由点及面，由一个工厂、工地至许多工厂、工地，有的甚至可以推广到全区全国。这样便能使苏联先进经验对我们的建设事业发生无穷无尽的力量。
    应当指出，现在我们学习苏联先进经验的条件是十分优越的。因为我们伟大的盟邦苏联派来了大批优秀的专家，直接帮助我们进行建设。这些为列宁、斯大林党所培养出来的人材，不但精通技术，而且有高度的国际主义的精神。他们把苏联的先进科学技术和先进经验毫无保留地介绍给我们，并且真诚无私地用尽一切办法帮助我们培养科学技术人材。例如中国长春铁路的苏联专家，两年来就为我们培养了一万七千多名技术人员，有名的女火车司机田桂英和铁路劳动模范李锡奎、王吉奎等，都是他们亲自培养起来的。因此，在他们热情地直接指导和帮助之下，我们学习苏联先进经验是无比的方便。我们应当十分尊重苏联专家们的建议，虚心地积极地向他们学习。
    在这次“中苏友好月”中，各地普遍开展了学习苏联先进经验的运动，许多业务部门大都对三年来学习苏联先进经验的成就进行了检查和总结，并在这个基础上提高了生产和工作，出现了不少的新纪录，为进一步学习与推广苏联先进经验创设了良好的条件。今后，我们还要继续不断地努力学习，切切实实把苏联先进经验运用到我国的具体条件下来，并把这一工作当作一个经常的工作来做，才能胜利地进行我国大规模的经济建设工作。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”在所有一切战线上工作的战士们，都要遵照这个指示，为了国家工业化，为了建设更美好的将来，以最大的热情、积极性和创造性，向苏联学习，向苏联专家们学习，把他们的经验变为我们有力的武器，用实际的成绩来完成我们光荣的艰巨任务。
