Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Various national people's organizations in China continue to issue statements, firmly supporting the solemn stand put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his reply telegram to Pearson, Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly.

    Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, stated: "On behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and women across the country, I firmly support the telegram from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, to Pearson, Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, on December 14, 1952. The various issues addressed in this reply and the reiterated just demands of our country regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue fully represent the will and aspirations of all Chinese women. The illegal resolution passed by the United Nations fully proves that the United Nations does not genuinely want to end the Korean War, but is instead subservient to the US government's conspiracy to suspend and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, and to prolong and expand the Korean War. Therefore, we absolutely cannot accept this illegal resolution. We believe that this illegal resolution will not only be resolutely opposed by the people of China and Korea, but will also arouse the anger and protest of every person of justice in the world.” A spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth stated: "The just proposals put forward in Minister Zhou Enlai's reply telegram, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly revoke this illegal resolution, ordering the US government to immediately resume the Panmunjom negotiations, and first implement a comprehensive ceasefire based on the draft Korean Armistice Agreement, and then hand over the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war to the ‘Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue’ for resolution, are precisely the urgent peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, and fully demonstrate the Chinese people’s eagerness to restore peace in Korea as soon as possible. Therefore, the Chinese youth express their full support for this.” Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, stated: “Chinese students fully support the solemn stand put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his reply telegram to Pearson, Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, on December 14. If the United Nations insists on this illegal resolution, then the United Nations and all those who support the war policies of US imperialism must bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this action.” A spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: "The people of our country have always loved peace and opposed war, and now they are even more eager for the early restoration of peace in Korea. Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's final reiteration in the reply telegram of our government's just demands regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue fully represents the will of the people of our country, and also represents the will of all peace-loving people in the world. The United Nations General Assembly has no reason to reject this just demand.” A spokesperson for the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce stated: "We believe that the United Nations General Assembly should uphold the principles of the Geneva Convention and other international laws regarding the repatriation of all prisoners of war, solemnly demand that the US side immediately resume the Panmunjom negotiations, and implement a comprehensive ceasefire between the two sides based on the draft Korean Armistice Agreement that has already been agreed upon by both sides, and hand over the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war, together with the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, to the ‘Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue’ for resolution, according to the proposal for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by Soviet representative Vyshinsky. However, the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly did not do so, and instead made this illegal resolution, which we absolutely cannot agree to; and is also resolutely opposed by all peace-loving people in the world.” A spokesperson for the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children stated: "We know that the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly is essentially an attempt to deceive the people of the world once again, so that the US government’s goal of violating international conventions and prolonging and expanding the Korean War can be achieved. If the shameless conspiracy of US imperialism is allowed to succeed, then the suffering of Korean children today may fall on the heads of children in China and any other country in the world tomorrow. The achievements of China's peaceful construction over the past three years have proven that only peace can protect the happy lives of children and enable them to grow up under reasonable education.” Xiong Jin-ding, Vice-Chairman of the Red Cross Society of China, stated: "All of us Red Cross workers in China fully support Minister Zhou Enlai’s solemn stand, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly immediately abolish this illegal resolution, order the US government to resume the Panmunjom negotiations, resolve the issue of prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and realize peace in Korea. Only in this way can the wishes of all peace-loving people be realized justly and reasonably.” A spokesperson for the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs stated: “As everyone knows, since the United Nations illegally passed the shameful slanderous resolution in February 1951 that falsely accused China of being an ‘aggressor’, its political standing in the eyes of the people of the world has been completely lost; the illegal passage of this resolution shows that the United Nations is willing to further degenerate and become a tool for the United States to expand the war. If the United Nations continues to persist in its mistakes, it will be tantamount to signing its own death warrant.”

    我国各人民团体
    坚决拥护周恩来外长的严正主张
    据新华社讯：我国全国性人民团体继续发表谈话，坚决拥护周恩来外长致联合国大会主席皮尔逊复电中所提出的严正主张。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超发表谈话说：“我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会和全国妇女，坚决拥护我中央人民政府外交部长周恩来在一九五二年十二月十四日复联合国大会主席皮尔逊的电文。这个复电中所答复的各项问题和重申的我国关于和平解决朝鲜问题的正义要求，是完全代表着我全中国妇女的意志和愿望的。联合国所通过的非法决议，完全证明了联合国不是真正想结束朝鲜战争，而是在曲从美国政府中止和破坏朝鲜停战谈判、延长和扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。因此，这一个非法的决议案，我们绝对不能接受。我们相信：这一非法决议案，不仅会受到中朝两国人民的坚决反对，而且会引起全世界每一个主持正义的人士的愤怒和抗议。”中华全国民主青年联合总会发言人发表谈话说：“周恩来部长的复电中所提出的要求联合国大会取消这个非法决议案，责成美国政府立即恢复板门店谈判，并根据朝鲜停战协定草案首先实行全面停战，然后再将战俘全部遣返问题交由‘和平解决朝鲜问题委员会’解决等正义主张，正是全世界人民迫切的和平愿望，且充分显示了中国人民切盼早日恢复朝鲜和平的热诚。因此，中国青年对此表示全力拥护。”中华全国学生联合会主席田德民发表谈话说：“中国学生完全拥护周恩来外交部长在十二月十四日致联合国大会主席皮尔逊复电中所提出的严正主张。如果联合国坚持这个非法决议案，则联合国及一切支持美帝国主义战争政策的人，必须要对这种行动的后果负严重责任。”中华全国文学艺术界联合会发言人发表谈话说：“我国人民一向热爱和平，反对战争，现在更切盼朝鲜的和平早日恢复。因之，我国周恩来外交部长在复电中最后重申我国政府关于和平解决朝鲜问题的正义要求，是完全代表了我国人民的意志的，同时也代表了世界一切爱好和平的人民的意志。联合国大会丝毫没有理由来拒绝这个正义的要求。”中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会发言人发表谈话说：“我们认为联合国大会应该坚持日内瓦公约和其他国际公法的遣返全部战俘的原则，严正地要求美国方面立即恢复板门店谈判，并根据苏联代表维辛斯基先生所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，根据双方业已获得协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，实现双方全面停火，而将战俘全部遣返问题与和平解决朝鲜问题，一起交由‘和平解决朝鲜问题委员会’去解决。但联合国第七届大会并没有这样做，相反地却作出了这种非法的决议，这是我们绝对不能同意的；同时也是全世界爱好和平人民所坚决反对的。”中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会发言人发表谈话说：“我们知道联合国大会所通过的这个决议案，实质上完全是企图再一次欺骗世界人民，使美国政府违反国际公约、延长和扩大朝鲜战争的目的得以实现。美帝国主义的无耻阴谋如果能够得逞，那么，今天朝鲜儿童所受的苦难，明天就可能落到中国和世界任何一个国家儿童的头上。三年来中国的和平建设的成就已经证明：只有和平才能保卫儿童的幸福生活，使他们能在合理的教养下成长。”中国红十字会副会长熊瑾玎发表谈话说：“我们全体中国红十字工作者完全拥护周恩来部长的严正主张，要求联合国大会立即废除这个非法的决议，责成美国政府恢复板门店的谈判，按照日内瓦公约的规定，解决战俘问题，实现朝鲜的和平。唯有如此，才能公正地合理地实现一切爱好和平人民的愿望。”中国人民外交学会发言人发表谈话说：“大家知道，联合国自从一九五一年二月非法通过了诬蔑中国为‘侵略者’的可耻的诽谤决议以来，它在全世界人民心目中的政治地位已经丧失殆尽；这次决议案的非法通过，表明了联合国甘心情愿更进一步地堕落下去，成为美国扩大战争的工具。如果联合国再继续坚持错误，那就等于是为自己送终。”
