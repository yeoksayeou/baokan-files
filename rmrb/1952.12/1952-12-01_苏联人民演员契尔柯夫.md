Soviet People's Artist, Stalin Prize winner, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and outstanding film actor Comrade Cherkasov, brings us great joy and happiness with his visit to our country as part of the Soviet Film Artists Delegation.

I was fortunate to participate in the symposium with the film actors and Comrade Cherkasov, which gave me the opportunity to learn more knowledge.

Comrade Cherkasov has successfully created brilliant Soviet heroic characters. In his youth, he successfully created the image of Maxim in the "Maxim Trilogy." Although this film was made more than ten years ago, the "Maxim Trilogy" is still loved by people today. Maxim's noble working-class qualities, optimism, energetic spirit, and infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause will forever inspire people to move forward. Comrade Cherkasov often receives letters from the audience addressed not to Cherkasov, but to "Maxim." Old people and adults alike thank Comrade Cherkasov for creating such a real Soviet character. Even elementary school children have not forgotten him. Once, an elementary school student wrote a letter and asked his teacher to forward it to "Maxim." The teacher asked him why he wrote this letter. He said, "My math grades are not good. Maxim will definitely help me. I don't know where he lives? I believe he must live in Moscow." Thus, the "Maxim Trilogy" has become a film that people can never forget, and "Maxim" has become one of the most beloved characters.

His successful creation was not accidental. In order to play this role, he lived in the factory for a long time, working, living, studying, and entertaining with his fellow workers. As he himself said, "An actor goes into life not to imitate a person, but to observe many people and experience them. He must not only have the ability to synthesize, but also the ability to analyze, and then he can create." Comrade Cherkasov's creation is based on life. Similarly, in the film "Chapayev," which was filmed as early as 1934, he successfully created an excellent image of an old farmer, showing his unique humor.

When Cherkasov created the role of "Glinka," he worked hard and diligently. In one year, he read a large amount of documentary material about Glinka, read Pushkin's letters to Glinka, studied the scores written by Glinka himself, and tried his best to find the inner state of the protagonist from the handwriting. Comrade Cherkasov, who is loved by the people, reproduced the real image of the great Russian composer.

Comrade Cherkasov also created the image of the teacher Stepan Ragutin in the film "The Teacher" directed by Gerasimov.

As Soviet society advances, the characters he plays are also changing. In 1948, he played Academician Veresky in the film "The Court of Honor." He brilliantly conveyed the enthusiasm of a Bolshevik patriot, as well as his strict principles and intransigence in the struggle. Dobrovolsky, Veresky's forty-year-old friend, invented a pain reliever of worldwide significance. He is a talented scientific researcher, but he believes in "world science" and holds the view that "science has no borders." This is the idea of cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is a reactionary bourgeois ideology. International imperialism, headed by US imperialism, wants to use this vicious ideological weapon to blind people's patriotism and seize their scientific achievements. Veresky waged an uncompromising struggle against this idea, and made righteous accusations. We clearly remember Veresky's powerful words: "...Who do you want to sell our country's treasures, its precious discoveries, and its beautiful hopes to? Who wants to throw humanity into the hell of war? We will never allow it! For the happiness of mankind, we will never allow it!... The Court of Honor, this is an educational trial. I very much want to make this case more intensely ignite the flames of patriotism among our scholars, the flames of love for our beautiful Soviet motherland!" Comrade Cherkasov said: "These words are the words of Veresky in the play, but they are also the words of every Soviet person, and they are also my personal words. Therefore, I used my personal feelings to truly film this scene." He prepared everything at home, went to the studio, and suggested to the director that this scene could be filmed directly without testing. Based on the director's trust in him, he did so, and the result was very good. From this we can understand Comrade Cherkasov's high political and artistic accomplishments, and the noble qualities of a Soviet People's Artist.

Cherkasov gave Veresky a special and unrepeatable personality. He achieved great success and won the Stalin Prize again for this.

In the recent film "Donbass Miners," he played the old miner Nedolyen again. He gave this role the heat of youth. Although the Soviet old people are old, their spirit is not old. They have unparalleled confidence in communist society, and they are representatives of the old generation of workers who created, established, and defended the Soviet regime, and are true mining heroes. In the first few shots, the audience saw that this lovely old man was played by Cherkasov. We respect the old miner Nedolyen, and we respect Comrade Cherkasov in the same way. We have great affection for him. At the same time, in "Hero of Gold Star," he also played the role of the district party committee secretary. He helped Sherazh ("Hero of Gold Star"'s protagonist) so correctly and forcefully. Although it was only a few short scenes, it was expressed so profoundly and powerfully. Cherkasov said, "Maxim would handle the problem that way now." For any role, he found the basis of life and the basis of history.

Comrade Cherkasov has created various types of characters with his amazing and profound talent.

He is an actor, a politician, and a social activist. After he was honorably elected as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet, he received one or two dozen letters every day that needed to be processed. Some letters put forward opinions on improving the work, some reported on their production, and some hoped to see new dramas and movies.... He replied to them every day, solving and answering these questions. Newspapers asked him to write articles, radio stations asked him to give speeches, and schools asked him to report. He said, "I am always in close contact with the masses." At the same time, he also serves as the artistic director of the "Moscow Film Actors Theater," and is cultivating a new generation of actors.

Comrade Cherkasov is one of the most beloved actors of the Chinese audience. The heroic image of the Soviet people he created will forever leave an indelible impression. These characters will serve as examples for us to learn from, and will generate great power in our work for the motherland and for peace. As a Chinese film actor, I sincerely thank Comrade Cherkasov for creating these brilliant and successful precedents for us. I believe that we will see his better works in the near future, and we hope so eagerly.

    苏联人民演员契尔柯夫
    桑夫
    苏联人民艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者、苏联最高苏维埃代表、杰出的电影演员契尔柯夫同志，随着苏联电影艺术工作者代表团光临我国，使我们感到莫大的愉快与幸福。
    我幸运地参加了电影演员和契尔柯夫同志的座谈会，使我有机会学习到更多的知识。
    契尔柯夫同志，成功地创造了光辉的苏维埃的英雄人物，还在他的青年时代，他就成功地创造了“马克辛三部曲”中的马克辛形象；虽然这部影片，早在十几年以前就摄制完成，但在今天“马克辛三部曲”仍然被人们所爱戴。马克辛高贵的工人阶级品质，乐观主义的精神，充沛的精力和对革命事业的无限忠诚，永远在鼓舞着人们前进。契尔柯夫同志常常收到观众的来信，上面写的不是契尔柯夫的名字，而是“马克辛”的名字，老年人，成年人都在感谢契尔柯夫同志创造了这样一位真实的苏维埃人物，就连小学校的儿童也没忘记他。一次有一位小学生，写了一封信，请他的老师转交给“马克辛”，老师问他写这信做什么？他说：“我的算术成绩不好，马克辛一定会帮助我，不知道他住在那里？我相信他一定住在莫斯科。”就是这样，“马克辛三部曲”成为人们永远不能忘记的影片，“马克辛”成为群众最喜爱的人物之一。
    他创作的成功，并不是偶然的。为了扮演这个角色，他长期地生活在工厂里，和工人同志一道工作、生活、学习和娱乐。正像他自己所说：“一个演员到生活中去，不是去模仿一个人，而是去观察许多人，体验他们，不但要有综合的能力，而且要有分析的能力，然后才能去创造。”契尔柯夫同志的创作是以生活为依据的。同样，早在一九三四年拍摄的“夏伯阳”影片中，他就成功地创造过一个极好的老农民形象，可以看到他所特有的幽默。
    契尔柯夫在创造“格林卡”这一角色时，他紧张努力的工作着，一年中他大量的阅读了关于格林卡的文献材料，阅读着普式庚给格林卡的信件，研究着格林卡亲手写作的总谱，竭力想从笔迹上来找到主人翁的内心状态。人民所敬爱的契尔柯夫同志重现了俄国伟大作曲家的真实形象。
    契尔柯夫同志还在格拉西莫夫导演的影片“教师”里，创造了教师斯杰潘·拉古金的形象。
    随着苏维埃社会的前进，他所扮演的人物，也在向前变化。一九四八年，他扮演了影片“荣誉的审判”的维列斯基院士，他出色地光辉地传达出布尔什维克爱国者的热情，和在斗争中严格的原则性以及不调和性。维列斯基四十年的老友多布洛沃尔斯基，发明了具有全世界意义的止痛剂，他是个天才的科学研究者，但是他信仰着“世界科学”、存在着“科学无国界”的观点，这正是世界主义的思想，世界主义是反动的资产阶级思想，以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义，想用这恶毒的思想武器，蒙蔽人民的爱国心，占有他们的科学成就。维列斯基就和这种思想进行了不调和的斗争，提出正义的控诉，我们清晰地记着维列斯基有力的语句：“……你想把我国的宝藏，把它的珍贵发现，它的美好希望出卖给谁？是谁想把人类投入战争的炼狱中去？我们绝不允许！为了人类的幸福，我们绝不允许！……荣誉的审判，这是使人受教育的审判，我非常想使这一案件更炽烈地燃烧我国学者们底爱国主义底火焰，爱我们美好的苏维埃祖国底爱情底火焰！”契尔柯夫同志说：“这段话是戏中人维列斯基的话，但也是每个苏联人民的话，也是我个人的话，因此，我就用我个人的情感真实地拍摄了这场戏。”他在家里准备好了一切，到摄影场去，向导演建议，这场戏可以不必试验就可以实拍，基于导演对他的信任就这样做了，而且结果很好。从这里我们可以了解到契尔科夫同志高度的政治修养与艺术修养。和做为一个苏联人民演员的高贵品质。
    契尔柯夫赋与了维列斯基特别的不可重复的个性，他得到了极大的成功，为此他再次获得了斯大林奖金。
    最近的影片“顿巴斯矿工”，他又扮演了老矿工聂道连。他赋与这角色青春的热力，苏维埃的老人，虽然年纪大了，但是精神并不老，他们对共产主义社会怀着无比胜利的信心，创造了建立并保卫了苏维埃政权的老工人一代的代表，真正的矿工英雄。观众在最初几个镜头中，就看到了这位可爱的老人就是契尔柯夫扮演的。我们敬爱老矿工聂道连，和敬爱契尔柯夫同志一样，我们对他发生了极大的感情。同时在“金星英雄”中，他还扮演了区党委书记的角色，他是那样正确有力地帮助了谢拉杰（“金星英雄”的主人翁。）虽然只是短短的几场戏，但是表现得那样深刻有力，契尔柯夫讲：“马克辛在现在就会那样处理问题。”任何一个角色，他都找到了生活的根据，和历史的根据。
    契尔柯夫同志以他惊人的雄厚的才能，创造了各种不同类型的人物。
    是演员，也是政治家，社会活动家。当他光荣地被选为最高苏维埃代表后，每天都有一二十封需要处理的信件，信中有的提出对工作改进的意见，有些报告他们生产的情况，有的希望能看到新的戏剧和电影……。他都每天给他们回信，解决和答复这些问题，报社请他写文章，广播电台请他讲演，学校请他报告，他说：“每时我都和群众密切联系着。”同时，他还担任着“莫斯科电影演员剧院”的艺术指导，在培养着年青一代的演员。
    契尔柯夫同志是中国观众最热爱的演员之一，他所创造的苏维埃人的英雄形象，将永远留下不可磨灭的印象，这些人物将做为我们学习的榜样，在我们为祖国，为和平而进行的工作中发生着巨大的力量。我做为一个中国电影演员，衷心地感谢契尔柯夫同志为我们创造了这些光辉成功的先例。相信不久的将来，会看到他更好的作品，我们这样热烈地希望着。
