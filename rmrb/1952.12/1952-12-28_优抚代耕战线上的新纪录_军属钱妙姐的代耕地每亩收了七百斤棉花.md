    A New Record on the Preferential Treatment and Substitute Farming Front
    —Military Dependent Qian Miao-jie's Substitute Farmed Land Yields 700 Jin of Cotton per Mu
  　Li Wen
    This year, the two mu of cotton belonging to Qian Miao-jie, a military dependent from Beiguan Village, Xingtang County, Hebei, yielded a full 1,400 jin. The whole family has replaced their cotton quilts with new cotton floss. Qian Miao-jie made uniforms for her two grandsons who are studying in elementary school, and also prepared new cotton clothes for them to wear for the New Year. Qian Miao-jie wrote a letter to her son, Qiu Yuxiang, on the Korean front, sharing her joy of the bumper harvest. The letter read: "You don't need to worry about home at all, the villagers are taking care of us in every way. This year, your brother Laizi is substitute farming for our family, using lots of fertilizer and working diligently, yielding 700 jin of cotton per mu... You can concentrate on fighting, win more battles, and repay the fellow villagers."
    Laizi's name is Qiu Luoji, the leader of the substitute farming team, a fifty-plus-year-old peasant who was liberated, and a well-known honest man in the village. He usually doesn't talk much, but he is very serious when he gets down to business. In the spring, the civil affairs committee member told him that it was his turn to substitute farm for the family of military dependent Qian Miao-jie. Luoji said, "Okay, their son is fighting in the freezing cold of Korea, we must wholeheartedly do a good job for the military dependent."
    Qiu Luoji led all the substitute farming team members in a meeting to discuss: how to increase production for military dependent Qian Miao-jie's family. Some team members advocated increasing production by 30% for the military dependent, most team members advocated planting two mu of high-yield land for the military dependent, and only one team member said: "It's enough if the military dependent's land yields as much grain as ordinary land, why bother with high-yield?" Qiu Luoji reported to everyone how he was considering the problem. He said: "Our lives have been steadily improving in the past two years. In the past, I used to harvest only a hundred or so jin of cotton per mu, last year I harvested 400 jin, and this year I want it to be 600 jin per mu. If the volunteers weren't guarding our gate, could we plant this 600 jin of cotton per mu? I think military dependents should be a little better off than us, plant two mu of cotton, and give her 1,400 jin, that way we can be worthy of the hard-working and meritorious volunteers." Some people expressed doubts about this number, but this attitude was immediately criticized by other team members. Team member Tong Fuxiang said: "It depends on what attitude we have towards the volunteers. As long as we are determined, we can create high-yield conditions for the military dependent." In the end, everyone agreed with Qiu Luoji's opinion. At the village's patriotic high-yield competition signing conference, Qiu Luoji announced the substitute farming high-yield plan to everyone on behalf of the team. After the meeting, Luoji walked home with great enthusiasm. His wife asked him, "I heard that you reported a high-yield plan of 700 jin of cotton per mu for the military dependent, how can it be so much?" This question made Qiu Luoji angry. He said: "You are sitting on a warm kang spinning cotton now, do you know that the volunteers are in the trenches, holding bayonets, staring at the enemy soldiers opposite! Without the volunteers, I don't think you would be able to spin cotton so peacefully." He continued, "In those two years (referring to before liberation), the Japanese devils and traitorous teams would come out of the city to grab laborers as soon as it got dark. We didn't dare to sleep at home, we wrapped ourselves in quilts and froze in the fields all night. Why weren't you spinning cotton peacefully then?" Seeing that Luoji was angry, his wife became anxious and quickly said, "I'm asking you out of kindness, it's not that I don't support you increasing production for the military dependent. I'm worried that you won't be able to complete the plan and people will say we're bragging. I think that the military dependent's two mu of cotton land will have to be more careful and require more effort than our land in order to succeed." "That's for sure!" Seeing that his wife also supported his substitute farming plan, Qiu Luoji's determination to increase production for the military dependent became even stronger.
    It is not easy to produce 700 jin of cotton per mu. Fertilization, cultivation, and technical management, if any one of them is not done well, the high-yield plan cannot be realized. Qiu Luoji deeply understood this. He and the substitute farming team members carefully studied every specific link and condition for realizing the high-yield. The team members said: "The military dependent has a pigsty, let's pull a few more carts of soil for her, so we can accumulate more manure." However, if you want to produce 700 jin, it is not enough to have only manure without refined fertilizer. Qiu Luoji said, "Let's each contribute 10,000 or 8,000 yuan, which will be enough for the military dependent to buy refined fertilizer." The team members were happy to do so, some contributing 10,000 yuan, and some contributing more than 10,000 yuan. Team member Qiu Luoshou took out 13,000 yuan, saying, "I have money now, if it's not enough, I can take out a few thousand more, it's a pleasure to do more for the volunteers." The substitute farming team members automatically collected money to buy 200 jin of soybean cakes for the military dependent (after the autumn harvest, the military dependent returned the money for buying fertilizer to each team member in full). The fertilizer problem was thus satisfactorily resolved.
    The team members carefully cultivated this cotton field. They plowed it four times, harrowed it with long-toothed harrows, and then harrowed it with short-toothed harrows, harrowing a total of six times. Seeing that the cotton seeds prepared by the military dependent in advance were not good enough, they specially borrowed top-quality seeds from labor model Qiu Luoyun. After the cotton seedlings emerged, they immediately replanted in the places where there were missing seedlings. When two leaves grew, they thinned the seedlings once; when four leaves grew, they thinned the seedlings a second time; when the seedlings were less than a foot tall, they thinned the seedlings in a timely manner. Seeing that insects had damaged a seedling, they transplanted seedlings to replace it, maintaining the integrity of 3,000 cotton seedlings per mu. While the cotton was being pruned and side shoots were being removed, Qiu Luoji fell ill. He could not go to the fields to work, but he still forced himself to get up every day, leaning on his crutches to personally inspect the military dependent's field. Aphids occurred several times in the cotton field, and the team members always concentrated on killing the insects in the military dependent's field first, immediately extinguishing the insects.
    In this way, Qiu Luoji's substitute farming team successfully realized the substitute farming plan of producing 700 jin of cotton per mu.
    On December 17, when I interviewed the substitute farming team leader Qiu Luoji, after he told me about the high-yield process of the cotton field, he said modestly: "Substitute farming for military dependents is our due responsibility, there is really nothing worth talking about. Everyone feels that if they don't work diligently for military dependents, they will be sorry for the volunteers." This is not just a kind of modesty, it also reflects a growing idea among the broad masses of peasants: everyone has a clearer understanding of their relationship with the people's army, and realizes that doing a good job in substitute farming and ensuring the output and life of military dependents is their due responsibility.

    优抚代耕战线上的新纪录
    ——军属钱妙姐的代耕地每亩收了七百斤棉花
  　力文
    河北行唐县北关村军属钱妙姐的二亩棉花，今年足足收了一千四百斤。全家人的棉被都换上了新花绒。钱妙姐为正在小学校读书的两个孙子做了制服，还替他们准备了过新年用的新棉衣。钱妙姐把丰收的喜悦，写信告诉给在朝鲜前线的儿子仇玉祥。信上写着：“你万不用惦记家，村上群众样样照顾咱。今年，你来子哥给咱家代耕，粪大力勤，每亩地收到七百斤棉花……你安心打仗吧，多打几个胜仗，来报答众乡亲。”
    来子的名字叫仇洛吉，是代耕组组长，一个五十多岁的翻身农民，村里出名的老实人，平素不爱说话，办起事来挺认真。开春，民政委员告诉他，该他给军属钱妙姐家代耕了。洛吉说：“行，人家小子在冰天雪地的朝鲜打仗，咱一定掏本心给军属好好干活。”
    仇洛吉领导全体代耕组员开会讨论：怎样为军属钱妙姐家增产。有的组员主张为军属增产三成，多数组员主张给军属种二亩丰产地，只有一个组员说：“军属的地比一般地不少打粮食就行了，何必搞丰产。”仇洛吉向大家报告自己是怎样考虑这个问题的。他说：“这二年咱们的日子，一个劲向上升，过去俺每亩地收棉花百十斤，去年收到四百斤，今年还要它每亩丰产六百斤。不是志愿军给咱们把好大门，咱这每亩六百斤的棉花能种得成吗？我觉得军属应该比咱高一点，种二亩棉花，给她收一千四百斤，这样才对得住劳苦功高的志愿军。”有人对这个数字表示怀疑，但这种态度立刻受到了别的组员的批评。组员仝福祥说：“这要看咱对志愿军抱啥态度，只要咱有决心，便能为军属创造丰产条件。”最后，大家一致同意了仇洛吉的意见。在全村爱国丰产竞赛签名大会上，仇洛吉代表全组向大家宣布了代耕丰产计划。开罢会，洛吉兴致勃勃地走回家，他老婆问他：“听说你给军属报了每亩七百斤棉花的丰产计划，怎么那样多？”这一问，仇洛吉生气了。他说：“你现下坐在热炕头上纺花，你知道不知道，志愿军正在战壕里，端着刺刀，两眼瞅着对面的鬼子兵哩！没有志愿军，我看你也不能安安稳稳地纺花。”他接着说下去：“那二年（指解放前），鬼子汉奸队天一黑便出城抓夫，咱们不敢在家睡觉，披起被子在野地里一冻一夜，那时你为啥不安稳地纺花呢？”老婆见洛吉动了气，也着急了，连忙说：“俺好心问你，又不是不赞成你为军属增产。俺耽心你完不成计划，人家说咱吹气哩。我思想着军属那二亩花地，得比咱的地更费心费工夫，才能行。”“那是自然喽！”仇洛吉见老婆也赞成自己的代耕计划，为军属增产的决心更大了。
    每亩地丰产七百斤棉花并不容易。施肥，耕作，技术管理，不论那一项做不好，都不能实现丰产计划。仇洛吉深深懂得这一点。他和代耕组员仔细地研究着实现丰产的每一个具体环节和条件。组员们说：“军属有猪圈，咱多给她拉几车土，便多积几圈粪。”但是，想丰产七百斤，只有圈粪没有细肥是不行的。仇洛吉说：“咱每人凑钱一万或八千，就够军属买细肥的了。”组员们都乐意这样做，有的出一万元，有的出一万多元。组员仇洛守拿出一万三千元，他说：“我现时有钱，如果还不够，再拿几千也好，能多为志愿军尽一份力，咱心眼里痛快。”代耕组员自动集款给军属买了二百斤豆饼（秋收后，军属把买肥料的钱，又如数归还各组员了）。肥料问题就这样圆满地解决了。
    组员们精心地修理着这块花地。他们把它耕了四遍，用长齿耙耙了，再用短齿耙耙，前后共耙了六遍。他们看着军属事先准备的棉种不够好，特地到劳动模范仇洛云那里借了上等的籽种。棉苗出土后，缺苗的地方，他们立即补种。长出两个叶的时候，一次间苗；长出四个叶了，二次间苗；苗长不足一尺高时，及时定苗。看到虫子咬坏一棵苗，便移苗补上，保持了每亩三千棵棉苗的完整。正在棉花整枝打杈的时候，仇洛吉病了，他不能到地里做活，每天仍然勉强起来，拄着拐棍亲自到军属地里查看。棉花地曾发生几次蚜虫，组员们都是先集中到军属地里灭虫，立刻把虫扑灭了。
    就这样，仇洛吉代耕组胜利地实现了每亩丰产七百斤棉花的代耕计划。
    十二月十七日，我访问代耕组长仇洛吉的时候，他向我叙述了棉地丰产经过之后，谦虚地说：“给军属代耕是咱应尽的责任，实在没啥值得讲的。大家都觉得给军属干活，不扎扎实实地干，便对不起志愿军。”这不只是一种谦虚，这也反映了广大农民中日益成长着的一种思想：大家已更清楚地知道了自己和人民军队的关系，认识到搞好代耕，保证军属的产量和生活，是自己应尽的责任。
