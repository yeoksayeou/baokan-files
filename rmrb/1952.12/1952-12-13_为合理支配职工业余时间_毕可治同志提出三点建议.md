    For the Rational Allocation of Employees' Leisure Time
    Comrade Bi Kezhi Proposes Three Suggestions
    To the Editor: The CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee's "Decision on the Allocation of Leisure Activity Time for Employees of State-owned and Public Factories" has not been well implemented in our Machine Tool Factory No. 1. This is because our political and ideological level is low, and our work ability is poor. When implementing central tasks or launching mass movements, we often squeeze out employees' political, cultural, and technical learning; sometimes, excessive and lengthy meetings affect employees' physical health and the completion of production tasks. In addition to making self-criticism, I would like to describe the actual situation in our factory, hoping to solve this problem more quickly and effectively with the help of leaders and the masses.
    The basic situation in our factory is as follows: more than two-thirds of the employees work during the day, from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM; slightly less than one-third of the employees work in two shifts, from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM; and 5% of the employees work in three shifts, working around the clock every day. Thus, it is very difficult to hold a factory-wide employee meeting.
    Not having enough time and being busy with meetings all day is an old problem in our factory. Cadres from various departments often argue over time, sometimes getting into heated arguments. Fundamentally, this is a matter of leadership art; however, there are indeed the following objective practical difficulties. The time for meetings and learning is as follows: employees participating in cultural and technical learning are divided into sixteen classes (due to different levels and types of work). According to the regulations of the Municipal Committee, 4 to 6 hours of learning time must be guaranteed each week; a trade union group meeting must be held at least once a week, lasting at least two hours; there is a political study session once a week (currently Party rectification), lasting at least two hours; there is a cleaning session once a week, also lasting at least two hours; a general employee meeting must be held twice a month to convey or report on production issues, lasting more than two hours; plus some temporary gatherings (such as celebrating the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," etc.), averaging at least two hours per month. The above is all the time for unified factory-wide activities, which means that every employee must participate. In addition, the Party branch must hold a meeting for Party members at least once or twice a month, with the participation of Youth League members and activists (these people account for about one-third of all employees), to summarize and arrange work; the Youth League must also hold a meeting once or twice a month; the trade union must hold a general employee meeting once or twice a month to mobilize workers to participate in production competitions or reward model workers; the security department must take up a certain amount of time each month to hold a factory-wide meeting of security committee members to arrange or study security work; the technical security department must also take up a certain amount of time to conduct safety education for workers; the health clinic must also strive to convey how to maintain personal hygiene and prevent diseases;… As for the leisure time of sections, offices, and workshops, it is even more difficult to arrange. They have even more things to do, and they must hold a general employee meeting in the workshop at least once or twice a month to review the patriotic production increase and frugality competition plan, review collective contracts, revise work quotas, etc., all of which must be carried out during leisure activity time, often leaving the workshop cadres dizzy. The problems of factory-level cadres are, of course, even more serious, with work and study time sometimes reaching about seventeen hours a day.
    If leisure activity time is like this, then what about working time? Let me give you an example: in September, I planned to write a summary at the end of the month, preparing to write it on the 28th. As soon as I got to work, the Municipal Committee called and said: "There is a visiting delegation coming to visit." So I was busy for a while. Just when I was about to pick up the pen again, comrades from the Municipal Committee's Industrial Department came to understand the factory's completion of the patriotic production increase and frugality competition plan. Before we finished talking, comrades from the higher-level trade union came to understand the production competition issues. Before they left, reporters from the Youth Daily wanted to interview the factory's Youth League work. So, the whole morning passed. Just after returning from lunch, comrades from the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee came to talk about how the factory's Party ensures the promotion of advanced experience. Immediately following, comrades from the Organizational Department of the Municipal Committee came to understand the factory's Party building situation. Another day passed. Let's write it the next day, but the next day the Municipal Committee's Industrial Department held another meeting to arrange the tasks for October. This summary could not be written unless I worked overtime at night.
    What is the reason for this busyness and chaos? Of course, it is due to our lack of planning and foresight in our work, and our inability to distinguish between priorities. This is the most important thing. The key to solving this problem, I think, lies first in strengthening the education and training of cadres to rapidly improve their ideological level and work ability. The leadership has already begun to do this. For example, we are required to spend six hours a week at the Municipal Committee to participate in political common sense and theory learning, and ten or eight hours to discuss and self-study; cadres above the workshop level are required to study the resolutions of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee's urban work conference for four hours a week, and the factory director participates in the Mechanical Bureau's business learning for six to nine hours a week. These are all very urgently needed. Secondly, I think that the leadership of the Municipal Committee should be more centralized, and the arrangement of work can be more balanced. Of course, the situation of chaotic steps of the Municipal Committee leadership no longer exists, but there are still situations where several tasks are arranged at the same time. For example, in November, the Propaganda Department wanted us to summarize the experience of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Organization Department wanted us to summarize the experience of cultivating labor models and cadres, and the Industrial Department wanted us to check the patriotic production increase and frugality competition plan. If the tasks are not put together, the lower-level cadres can avoid being overwhelmed. Finally, I suggest appropriately adjusting the units that come to visit and conduct research. Now, there are a work team from the Northeast Bureau investigating and studying factory management work in our factory, a work team from the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions investigating and studying employee labor insurance and welfare work, and a work team from the Mechanical Bureau investigating and studying the division of labor and specialization work; today a visiting delegation comes, and tomorrow another visiting delegation comes. Of course, helping us to investigate, study, summarize work, and come to our factory to visit is something we welcome, but it should be based on the principle of not excessively increasing our burden and affecting employees' learning. If the above problems can be solved, the rational allocation of employees' leisure activity time will be better guaranteed.

### 为合理支配职工业余时间  毕可治同志提出三点建议

    为合理支配职工业余时间
    毕可治同志提出三点建议
    编辑同志：中共沈阳市委“关于国、公营工厂职工业余活动时间支配问题的决定”在我们机械一厂并没有很好贯彻。这是由于我们的政治思想水平低，工作能力差，当贯彻中心工作或开展群众运动时，往往挤掉了职工的政治、文化和技术学习；有时因会议过多时间又长，以致影响了职工的身体健康和生产任务的完成。对此，我除了作检讨外，并愿意把厂里的实际情形说一说，以期通过领导和群众的帮助，把这个问题更快地、更好地得到解决。
    我们厂的基本情况是这样的：三分之二以上的职工是白天干活，由早上七点到下午四点；三分之一弱的职工是两班倒，即由晚上十时到早晨六时；还有百分之五的职工是三班制，即每天二十四小时轮流不停地工作着。这样，要开一个全厂性的职工大会是很困难的。
    时间不够用，整天忙于开会，在我们厂是个老问题。各个系统的干部，往往因为争时间而闹得脸红脖子粗。说起来最根本的是个领导艺术问题；但确实也存在着如下的客观实际困难。会议和学习的时间一共有这许多：参加文化、技术学习的职工共分十六个班次（因为程度不同，工种不同），按照市委的规定，每周要保证四小时至六小时的学习时间；每周最少要开一次工会小组会议，最少是两小时；每周有一次政治学习（目前是整党），最少是两小时；每周有一次清洁扫除，也是最少得两小时；每月要开两次全体职工大会，传达或报告有关生产上的问题，时间在两个小时以上；再加上一些临时性的集会（如庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开和“中苏友好月”等），平均每月最少得占两小时。以上都是全厂统一活动的时间，也就是说每个职工都要参加的。此外，党总支每月最少得开一次到两次的党员会议，吸收青年团员和积极分子参加（这些人约占全体职工三分之一），总结和布置工作；青年团每月最少也得召开一、两次会议；工会每月得开一、两次职工大会，发动工人参加生产竞赛或奖励模范工作者；保卫部门每月得占一定时间开全厂的治安保卫委员会议，布置或研究保卫工作；技术保安部门也要占一定时间给工人进行安全教育；卫生所也要争取时间传达如何做好个人卫生和预防疾病；……至于科、室和车间的业余时间就越发摆不开了。他们的事情就更多，每月至少要开一、二次车间全体职工会议，检查爱国增产节约竞赛计划、检查集体合同、修改工时定额等等，这些都得在业余活动时间进行，往往弄得车间干部昏头昏脑。厂
    一级干部的问题当然更加严重，每天工作和学习的时间有时达十七小时左右。
    业余活动时间是这样，那么工作时间又是怎样呢？我随便举个例子吧：九月份我打算在月末写个总结，准备在二十八日写。刚上班市委就来电话说：“有参观团要来参观。”于是忙了一阵子，才要重新拿起笔来，市委工业部的同志要来了解本厂完成爱国增产节约竞赛计划的情况。还没有谈完，上级工会的同志又来了解生产竞赛问题。他们还没有走，青年报的记者又要来采访本厂青年团的工作情况。这样一个上午就过去了。吃过午饭刚回来，中共中央东北局的同志来谈谈本厂党是怎样保证先进经验的推广问题。紧跟着，市委组织部的同志又来了解本厂建党的情况。这一天又过去了。第二天写吧，但第二天市委工业部又召开会议，布置十月份任务。这份总结，如果不在夜里加班赶一赶，就没法写。
    这样忙和乱究竟是什么原因呢？当然是由于我们工作中缺乏计划性和预见性，分不清轻重缓急。这是最主要的。解决这个问题的关键，我觉得：首先在于加强对干部的教育和培养，以便迅速提高其思想水平和工作能力。这一点领导上已经开始这样做了。如规定我们每周六小时的时间到市委去参加政治常识和理论学习，以十或八个小时来讨论和自修；规定车间以上的干部学习中共中央东北局城市工作会议决议，每周四小时，厂长参加机械局的业务学习，每周六至九小时。这些都是十分迫切需要的。其次我觉得市委的领导还应该更集中些，布置工作还可以更均衡一些。当然现在市委领导步调混乱的情形是没有了，但同一时期布置几个任务的情况还是有的。例如十一月份宣传部要我们总结学习苏联先进经验的经验，组织部要我们总结培养劳动模范和干部的经验，工业部要我们检查爱国增产节约竞赛计划。任务不凑在一起，就可以减少下面的干部的手忙脚乱。最后是建议适当调整外来参观和调查研究工作的单位。现在我们厂里就有东北局的工作组在调查、研究工厂管理工作，沈阳市总工会的工作组在调查研究职工劳保福利工作，机械局的工作组在调查研究劳动分工专业化工作；今天是这一个参观团来了，明天又是那一个参观团。当然，帮助我们调查、研究、总结工作和到我们厂来参观，都是我们所欢迎的，但应该以不过分增加我们的负担和影响职工的学习为原则。能够解决上述几个问题，合理支配职工的业余活动时间就更有保证了。    中共沈阳机械一厂总支书记  毕可治
