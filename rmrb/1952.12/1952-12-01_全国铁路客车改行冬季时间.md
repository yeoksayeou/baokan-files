Detailed schedules for Beijing to Shenyang, Beijing to Xi'an, and Beijing to Qingdao have also been changed and have been announced at stations throughout the country. The winter schedules on all lines have been shortened by 1 hour and 17 minutes to 2 hours and 22 minutes compared to the summer schedules. This is a result of the improved transportation efficiency since the nationwide launch of the full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement by national railways beginning this May.
