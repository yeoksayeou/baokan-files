    Do a Good Job in Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers
    The China Peace Committee recently issued "Instructions on Continuing to Strengthen the Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea." This is a very important document that requires our people nationwide to study carefully, formulate specific measures, and earnestly implement it to strive for greater victories in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    As the instructions pointed out, at present, U.S. imperialism is actively preparing to expand the war of aggression against Korea. The U.S. side has unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations for more than two months by unreasonably insisting on its principle of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Recently, it has even used the majority it manipulates in the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution disguised in Indian clothing, on the one hand extorting more cannon fodder from its accomplice countries, and on the other hand intensifying the persecution of prisoners of war, resulting in the massacre of more than 200 of our captured personnel killed and wounded in the Koje-do prisoner of war camp. The war cries of warmongers in the United States and their generals on the Korean front are becoming more and more rampant. Newly elected President Eisenhower personally went to Korea to plan the war. Now, according to the Associated Press, "America's new and powerful Far East military strategy is beginning to take shape." These facts show that a new and more insane military adventure by the United States is being actively prepared. This is one aspect. On the other hand, our country's large-scale economic construction will begin in full swing with the arrival of 1953. In the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have fought side by side, heavily hitting the American aggressors, stabilizing the situation in Korea, and ensuring the successful completion of the country's economic recovery and transformation work. In the future, large-scale economic construction will require our Chinese and Korean people's forces to achieve more and greater victories, giving the U.S. aggressors a heavier blow to any new military adventures, striving for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue, and firmly defending lasting peace in the Far East and the world. Only when our people across the country do a better job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, so that the volunteers on the front can receive continuous and ever-increasing material and spiritual support from the people of the motherland, can they achieve greater and greater victories and defeat any conspiracy of the aggressors to expand the war. The victory of the volunteers on the front is a guarantee of the victory of the motherland's economic construction. The people of the motherland doing a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is an important guarantee for the volunteers to achieve victory on the front.
    How can our people across the country do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea? The instructions pointed out that it is necessary to continue to deepen ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, strengthen the patriotic production increase and thrift movement, and do a good job in all aspects of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and supply and comfort work. Ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the center of all work. Only by making the idea of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea deeply rooted in the hearts of the people can other work be done well. Therefore, we must integrate ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea with all daily work, and constantly use the internationalist and heroic spirit of the volunteers to encourage the people across the country to actively participate in the construction of the motherland and various tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, so that it "becomes an important driving force for overcoming difficulties in construction." According to the experience of North China, the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system is the best way for the masses to conduct ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea themselves. Through the "Patriotic Inspection Day," ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea can be combined with other daily work, improve the consciousness of the masses, inspect and revise patriotic pacts, and promote the progress of all work. The importance attached to leadership by party committees at all levels and the core role of branches are the key to adhering to and improving the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system and ensuring that this system can effectively play its due role.

### 做好抗美援朝工作支援中国人民志愿军

    做好抗美援朝工作支援中国人民志愿军
    中国人民抗美援朝总会最近发布了“关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示”，这是一个非常重要的文件，需要我们全国人民认真研究，订出具体办法，切实贯彻，以争取抗美援朝斗争获得更大的胜利。
    正如指示所指出的，目前美帝国主义正在积极准备扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。美方为无理坚持其强迫扣留战俘的原则而片面中断停战谈判已经两个多月了，最近更利用其所操纵的联合国多数通过披着印度外衣的非法决议案，一面向帮凶国勒索更多的炮灰，一面加紧迫害战俘，致造成在蜂岩岛战俘营打死打伤我方被俘人员二百余人的大屠杀案。美国国内好战分子及其朝鲜前线的将军们的战争叫嚣已越来越猖狂，新当选的总统艾森豪威尔亲自到朝鲜去策划战争，现在，据合众社说，“美国的新的、强有力的远东军事战略正开始粗具规模”了。这些事实说明，美国的新的更疯狂的军事冒险正在积极准备中。这是一方面。另一方面，我们祖国的大规模的经济建设即将随一九五三年的到来而全面开始了。在过去两年中，由于我中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战沉重打击了美国侵略者，稳定了朝鲜的战局，保障我们胜利完成了国家经济的恢复与改造工作；那么，在今后大规模的经济建设中，就要求我们中朝人民部队获得更多的更大的胜利，给美国侵略者新的军事冒险以更沉重的打击，争取朝鲜问题得到公平合理的解决，坚固地保卫远东和世界的持久和平。只有我们全国的人民把抗美援朝的工作做得更好，使前线的志愿军能得到祖国人民源源不断的越来越大的物质和精神的支援，才能使他们获得越来越大的胜利，打垮侵略者任何扩大战争的阴谋。志愿军在前线的胜利是祖国经济建设胜利的保证，祖国人民做好抗美援朝工作，则是志愿军在前线获得胜利的重要保证。
    我们全国人民怎样做好抗美援朝的工作呢？指示指出：必须继续深入抗美援朝的思想教育，必须加强爱国增产节约运动，必须做好一切拥军优属工作和供应慰问工作。而抗美援朝的思想教育是一切工作的中心，只有使抗美援朝的思想深入人心才能把其他工作做好。因此我们必须结合一切日常工作进行抗美援朝的思想教育，经常地用志愿军的国际主义英雄主义精神鼓舞全国人民积极参加祖国建设和各项抗美援朝工作，使它“成为建设中克服困难的一个重要动力”。根据华北的经验，“爱国检查日”制度是群众自己进行抗美援朝思想教育的一个最好的方式，通过“爱国检查日”可以把抗美援朝思想教育和其他日常工作结合起来，提高群众的觉悟，检查和修订爱国公约，推动一切工作的进行。各级党委的重视领导与支部的核心作用，是坚持和健全“爱国检查日”制度和使这一制度能切实起它应有的作用的关键。
