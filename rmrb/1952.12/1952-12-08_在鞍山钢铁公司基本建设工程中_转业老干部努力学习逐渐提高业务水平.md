    In the basic construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    Transferred Veteran Cadres Strive to Learn and Gradually Improve Their Professional Skills
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the large-scale basic construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China selected a group of veteran cadres to participate in the work in Anshan. After several months of practice, this group of veteran cadres has initially become familiar with the situation and business, and has played a leading role in the work.
    At the end of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began to systematically and step-by-step transfer a group of veteran cadres from North China and East China to Anshan. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also successively dispatched two groups of cadres to the basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. In September, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China continued to transfer more than 100 cadres from the Central and Southern Region to work in Anshan. Seventy percent of them were veteran cadres.
    These veteran cadres used to work in Party, government, rural, and mass positions. They were completely unfamiliar with industrial work, especially basic construction. Many people simply thought that basic construction was just building houses. In response to this situation, Anshan Iron and Steel Company first assigned them to work at various construction sites and grassroots units so that they could quickly become familiar with the situation and master the business. After such a short period of practice, these veteran cadres realized the importance and complexity of basic construction work, and thus clearly realized that they must closely combine business learning with work. Most of the veteran cadres overcame various difficulties with an indomitable spirit to carry out learning and work. They asked if they didn't understand and learned if they couldn't. For example, the veteran cadres transferred from the Central and Southern Region (including prefectural committee-level cadres) who worked at construction site 101 studied culture, mathematics, physics, and chemistry every morning amidst their busy work, and established a mutual teaching and learning system with the technical personnel; they also took time out every night to study collectively and urged each other. Guo Zhaolin, the deputy captain of the surveying team at construction site 101, had a low level of education, but he fully realized the glorious task assigned to him by the Party. He said with great confidence: "I will learn one thing a day, and I will learn it!" He Muzhang, the director of the political department at construction site 102, recited the work procedures in bed at night. Within a month, he learned to read blueprints. Due to their high revolutionary consciousness and humble and assiduous learning, these veteran cadres are now full of confidence in large-scale basic construction work. Now, they are confidently going deep into the front lines, closely contacting the workers, educating and uniting technical personnel, implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, and completing the country's engineering plans.

    在鞍山钢铁公司基本建设工程中
    转业老干部努力学习逐渐提高业务水平
    为加强鞍山钢铁公司大规模基本建设工程的领导力量，中共中央组织部曾选派一批老干部到鞍山参加工作。这一批老干部经过几个月的实践，已初步熟悉了情况和业务，在工作中发挥了领导作用。
    “三反”运动末期，中共中央组织部就开始有计划地、有步骤地从华北、华东抽调了一批老干部到鞍山去。中共中央东北局也先后向鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门派遣了两批干部。九月份，中共中央组织部继续由中南区调派干部百余人到鞍山工作。其中百分之七十是老干部。
    这些老干部过去都在党的、政权的、农村的、群众的岗位上工作，对于搞工业，特别是搞基本建设完全生疏。许多人曾经简单地认为基本建设就是盖房子。针对这个情况，鞍山钢铁公司首先分配他们到各个工地、各个基层单位工作，使他们能够较快地熟悉情况和掌握业务。经过这样一个短时期的实践，这些老干部认识了基本建设工作的重要性和复杂性，从而明确地认识到必须密切结合着业务学习来进行工作。大多数老干部都以百折不回的精神克服各种困难进行学习和工作。他们不懂就问，不会就学。例如在一○一工地工作的中南区调来的老干部（包括地委级干部），在繁忙的工作中，每天早晨学习文化、数学、物理、化学等功课，并和技术人员订立了互教互学的制度；每晚还抽出时间集体学习，彼此督促。一○一工地测量队副队长郭兆麟，文化水平低，但他充分认识到党交给他的这个光荣任务，他非常有信心地说：“我一天学一件，也要学会它！”一○二工地政治处主任贺木璋，晚上躺在床上还背工序，一个月内，他就学会了看图纸。由于高度的革命觉悟和虚心刻苦的学习，这些老干部已对大规模的基本建设工作充满了信心。现在他们正满怀信心地深入现场，密切联系工人群众，教育和团结技术人员，贯彻苏联专家建议，完成国家的工程计划。
