Introducing "Sino-Soviet Friendship Documents"
Shu Chang
Edited and published by the People's Publishing House, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore

    The book "Sino-Soviet Friendship Documents" is a selection from a large number of historical documents related to Sino-Soviet friendship. The book is divided into three sections: The first section contains articles and speeches by Lenin and Stalin on the Chinese revolution and by Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong on Sino-Soviet friendship, some of which are excerpts; the second section contains the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other most important diplomatic documents between China and the Soviet Union; the third section contains telegrams from the leaders of China and the Soviet Union congratulating Sino-Soviet friendship.

    "Sino-Soviet Friendship Documents" clearly demonstrates that the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is based on lofty revolutionary interests.

    As early as 1912, Lenin expressed his great concern for the Chinese revolution in his article "Democracy and Populism in China." He correctly analyzed the characteristics of the Chinese bourgeois democrats headed by Sun Yat-sen. In this article, Lenin enthusiastically pointed out the great potential strength of the Chinese people with the following famous sentence. He said: "This great people is not only capable of lamenting their centuries of slavery, not only capable of dreaming of freedom and equality, but also capable of fighting against the centuries-old oppressors of China." At this time, Lenin also predicted the emergence of a Chinese workers' party. He said: "Because the number of Shanghais will increase in China, the Chinese proletariat will also grow. It will certainly establish one or another Chinese Social Democratic Labor Party."

    In the article "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia," Lenin pointed out the close connection between the Chinese and Asian revolutionary movements and the world proletarian revolutionary movement. Lenin wrote: "The entire ruling power of Europe, the entire European bourgeoisie, has formed an alliance with all the reactionary and medieval forces of China. But the entire young Asia, that is, the hundreds of millions of laborers of Asia, has a reliable ally in the proletariat of all civilized countries. No force in the world can prevent them from achieving victory in liberating the peoples of Europe and Asia."

    The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution was a great inspiration to the Chinese people. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese revolution, said: "Because of the Russian revolution, mankind in the world has gained a great hope." Sun Yat-sen was unable to complete his cause. But he never forgot the great friend of the Chinese people, the Soviet Union, as long as he lived. In his "Letter to the Soviet Union," he closely linked the Chinese revolutionary cause with Soviet assistance, and said: "It is hoped that dawn will soon break, and at that time, the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands and advance together in the great battle to liberate the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory."

    Stalin pointed out in 1918, "Do not forget the East." In 1925, Stalin further pointed out that "the power of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable," and said: "Truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we sympathize with the Chinese revolution now and in the future, which is fighting to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and to unify China into one country." In the following two years, Stalin continued to give correct and detailed instructions to the rising Chinese revolutionary movement. Although these instructions were betrayed by the right-leaning opportunists at the time and the later "left"-leaning opportunists, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, overcame right-leaning and "left"-leaning opportunism, resolutely implemented Stalin's instructions, and won the final victory of the Chinese revolution.

    Mao Zedong believed that Soviet assistance was an indispensable condition for the final victory of the Chinese revolution. In the article "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People," written to celebrate Stalin's sixtieth birthday, Mao Zedong pointed out, "Only socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and laborers can truly assist the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance." Mao Zedong's thought runs through all his related works. The Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong had unwavering faith in the Soviet Union and Stalin, and realized that supporting the Soviet Union was also supporting their own revolutionary cause. During the Soviet people's Great Patriotic War, Mao Zedong wrote: "The Red Army of Stalingrad has done a heroic deed concerning the fate of all mankind. They are the children of the October Revolution. The banner of the October Revolution is invincible, and all counter-revolutionary fascists will be destroyed." He taught that "We Chinese people celebrate the victory of the Red Army, and at the same time, we celebrate our own victory."

    It is precisely because there is such a lofty and far-reaching spiritual connection of revolutionary allies between the Chinese and Soviet peoples that the friendly relationship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, which developed in the Chinese revolution and was fixed by treaty after the victory of the Chinese revolution, is permanent and unbreakable.

    The book "Sino-Soviet Friendship Documents" selects the most important documents in a small number of pages, which is more convenient for the reading of the majority of readers.

    介绍“中苏友好文献”

    “中苏友好文献”一书是从有关中苏友好的大量历史文献中选编出来的。全书内容分为三辑：第一辑是列宁、斯大林论述中国革命问题和孙中山、毛泽东论述中苏友好的文章和演说，其中一部分是节录；第二辑是中苏友好同盟互助条约和中苏两国间其他最重要的外交文献；第三辑是中苏两国领袖祝贺中苏友好的电文。
    “中苏友好文献”清楚地说明了中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友好关系是以崇高的革命的利益为基础的。
    早在一九一二年，列宁就在“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”一文中表示了他对于中国革命的伟大的关怀。他正确地分析了以孙中山为首的中国资产阶级民主主义者的特点。在这文章中，列宁用如下有名的句子热情地指出中国人民的伟大潜在力量。他说：“这个伟大的人民不仅善于悲叹自己成百年的奴隶地位，不仅善于梦想自由和平等，而且还善于同中国成百年的压迫者作斗争。”列宁在这时并已预言了中国工人政党的出现。他说：“因为上海的数目在中国将增加，中国无产阶级也将增长起来。它
    一定会成立这样或那样的中国社会民主工党”。
    在“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”一文中，列宁指出了中国及亚洲革命运动和世界无产阶级革命运动的密切的联系。列宁写道：“整个欧洲的当权势力，整个欧洲的资产阶级，与中国反动的和中世纪的一切势力结成联盟了。
    但是，整个年青的亚洲，即亚洲的几万万劳动者，却有一切文明国家的无产阶级这个可靠的同盟者。世界上任何力量都不能阻止他们把欧洲人民和亚洲人民解放出来的胜利。”
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，对于中国人民是巨大的鼓舞。中国革命的先行者孙中山说：“因为有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望。”孙中山没有能完成他的事业。但是他在一息尚存之时总是不忘记中国人民的伟大的朋友——苏联。他在“致苏联遗书”中把中国革命事业和苏联的援助紧紧联系起来，并且说：“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    斯大林在一九一八年就曾经指出“不要忘记东方”。在一九二五年斯大林又进一步指出“中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的”，并且说：“真理和正义完全是在中国革命方面。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国革命，它正在为了把中国人民从帝国主义羁绊下解放出来并且为了把中国统一成为一个国家而斗争着。”在以后两年多时间里，斯大林继续对正在高涨着的中国革命运动作了正确的和详尽的指示。这些指示虽然曾为当时右倾机会主义者和后来的“左”倾机会主义者所背弃，但是中国人民在毛泽东领导下，克服右倾和“左”倾机会主义，坚决地执行了斯大林的指示，并获得了中国革命的最后胜利。
    毛泽东认为苏联的援助是中国革命最后胜利的不可缺少的条件。在为庆祝斯大林六十寿辰而作的“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”一文中，毛泽东指出，“中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，社会主义的领袖，社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才能真正援助；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”毛泽东的这个思想贯彻在他的所有有关的著作中。在毛泽东领导下的中国人民对于苏联、对于斯大林，怀着不可动摇的信心，并且看出对苏联的支持也就是对自己的革命事业的支持。在苏联人民的伟大卫国战争中，毛泽东写道：“斯大林格勒的红军做出了有关全人类命运的英雄事业，他们是十月革命的儿女，十月革命的旗帜是不可战胜的，而一切反革命的法西斯则必归于消灭。”他教导说，“我们中国人民庆祝红军的胜利，同时也即是庆祝自己的胜利。”
    正是由于中苏两国人民之间存在着这样一种革命同盟者的崇高的和深远的精神联系，所以中苏两国人民在中国革命中发展起来并在中国革命胜利以后用条约固定下来的友好关系，是永远存在的和牢不可破的。
    “中苏友好文献”一书用不多的篇幅，选编了最重要的文献，对于最大多数读者的阅读，是较便利的。
