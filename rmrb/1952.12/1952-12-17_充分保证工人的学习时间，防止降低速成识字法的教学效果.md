    Fully Guarantee Workers' Study Time to Prevent Reducing the Teaching Effectiveness of the Quick Literacy Method
    Yang Lisheng
    In adopting the quick literacy method to promote illiteracy eradication, in addition to making ideological preparations and organizational preparations, and ensuring that teachers truly understand and master the spirit and teaching methods of the quick literacy method, it is also necessary to effectively guarantee sufficient teaching time. This is because one of the basic characteristics of the quick literacy method's teaching approach is to allow students to highly concentrate their energy for short, intensive bursts of study within a continuous and concentrated timeframe. If the time is prolonged, it will distract the students' energy and affect their mood, thereby reducing the teaching effectiveness.
    Since the Northeast region began promoting illiteracy eradication, the problem of guaranteeing teaching time has generally been well resolved due to the attention and support of leading organs at all levels. For example, in the units of the Shenyang City machinery system that are implementing the quick literacy method, the minimum study time is eight to ten hours per week, while Factories No. 5 and No. 23 have twelve hours. In Benxi City, among the forty-nine classes implementing the quick literacy method, thirty-eight classes can guarantee eight to twelve hours of study time per week. Benxi Coal Mine's Baozha Pit and Mechanical Factory No. 3 only occupied study time three times in three or four months due to the promotion of advanced experience, the conduct of major safety inspections, and National Day propaganda. Mechanical Factory No. 4 also occupied study time, but made up for it with other time afterwards. Benxi No. 1 Power Plant, however, maintained regular study throughout the entire intensive teaching phase.
    However, on the other hand, some units have not been able to guarantee teaching time because the leadership lacks sufficient understanding of the great significance of promoting illiteracy eradication through the quick literacy method and does not fully grasp the basic teaching spirit of the quick literacy method. This manifests in many forms. Some set the weekly study time too short to meet the teaching requirements. For example, the Andong District of the railway system generally only has four and a half hours of study time per week; in the Changchun-Dalian line, 30 percent of units only study for three hours per week. In Jilin and Jinzhou districts, where the time is relatively sufficient, it is generally only six to eight hours per week. In the forestry system, the study time is also generally insufficient, with places like Jilin having only six hours per week. Some units have shown a "tight at first, then loose" phenomenon in their leadership of worker study. The time originally set was very sufficient, but the study time was arbitrarily reduced midway because production tasks could not be completed and more time was needed for meetings to solve production problems. For example, Benxi Steel Plant originally had ten hours of study time per week, but four hours were taken away. The hardened oil workshop and grease workshop of the Shenyang Chemical Plant originally had twelve hours of study time per week, but this was reduced to eight hours. Sometimes, even the reduced time could not be guaranteed. For example, the grease workshop was nominally scheduled to study twice a week, but meetings were held whenever there were meetings, and learning was only notified temporarily by radio when there were no meetings. Therefore, these two study sessions could not be guaranteed. Some workshop cadres at Benxi Steel Plant did not allow workers to leave work at the appointed time because the day's production task had not been completed; others casually called workers to meetings during study time. From these situations, it can be seen that the phenomena of insufficient and unguaranteed study time still exist to a significant degree.
    The losses caused by not being able to guarantee teaching time are very serious. From the perspective of teaching methods, this violates the teaching spirit of the quick literacy method. Due to time constraints, teachers have to spend most or all of the classroom teaching time on intensive teaching. Also due to time constraints, teachers cannot understand the students' learning situation before class, and cannot carry out propaganda and mobilization aimed at the students' ideological situation in the classroom. Moreover, the segmented teaching method (segmented intensive study, segmented review, segmented consolidation) cannot be applied. The new characters to be taught are crammed in one go, with little or no group review activities in between, and the tutors lose their due guiding role. In this way, classroom teaching takes the form of "teachers lecturing, students listening," which is essentially no different from the old teaching methods.
    Secondly, because the weekly study time is too short, the teaching progress is slow, which doubles the total teaching time. According to the average teaching progress of the hardened oil workshop and the grease workshop of the Shenyang Chemical Plant, it takes more than ten teaching sessions and more than five or six weeks to teach a unit. In this way, more than a month separates the beginning and end of a unit, and what was learned at the beginning is forgotten later. In order to consolidate learning outcomes, it is necessary to regularly set aside time for stage review and unit review; all the new characters that have been intensively studied must also be reviewed regularly. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned review, it is also necessary to conduct a head-to-tail cyclical review. As more new characters are learned, the longer the cyclical review time will be. According to statistics from Benxi Steel Plant: after the fourth unit was taught, it took nine hours to review from the first unit; after the fifth unit was taught, it took seven hours to review from the beginning, in addition to reviewing the unit itself. The hardened oil workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant estimated that it would take twenty sessions to review the sixth unit, including the general review. Such a time-consuming process actually reduces the effectiveness. Regarding the specific teaching progress, it can be seen from the teaching situation of Li Runtian, a teacher in the steel rolling workshop of Benxi Steel Plant. It takes him about fifty hours to teach five hundred characters, with an average progress of more than ten characters per hour. In this way, it would take about two hundred hours to teach two thousand characters. This only refers to the intensive study of new characters. If the teaching time for phonetic alphabet and reading and writing is added, the intensive stage alone (from phonetic alphabet to reading and writing) will take more than a year or nearly two years (based on 24 hours per month and 300 hours per year). In this way, there is no sense of "quickness" at all.
    Third, due to time constraints, students cannot fully review in class, and they cannot remember what they have learned, which affects their learning mood. The total teaching time is too long, and students feel that there is no end to learning, thus doubting the quick literacy method and losing confidence. For example, Li Baochun, a worker in the hardened oil workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant, once asked the teacher: "Didn't you say that illiteracy can be eradicated in more than two months? Why have we only learned so few characters now? We can't finish learning even in a year, so what's quick about it!" The workers of Benxi Steel Plant also reacted: the quick literacy method is not as good as the old method, when a few characters were taught a day, they could be "mastered in four ways," that was quick. As a result, students are distracted and their learning mood is not high. Some workers at Benxi Steel Plant would change their clothes and take a bath after work, and seeing that twenty minutes had passed, they simply did not go to study; before class was over, some students ran to the station to prepare to take the bus home. Some workers in the hardened oil workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant simply forgot about studying, and some were absent without leave. Therefore, the attendance rate is very low. The steelmaking workshop of Benxi Steel Plant originally had 207 students, but according to statistics in October, less than 100 people regularly study.
    What is the teaching effect when teaching time cannot be guaranteed? Let's look at the test scores: Benxi Steel Plant tested 631 characters, and people who recognized more than 500 characters accounted for 61 percent, those who recognized more than 400 characters accounted for 10 percent, those who recognized more than 300 characters accounted for 6 percent, and those who recognized less than 300 characters accounted for 23 percent. The grease workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant tested 25 people on 1,184 characters, 7 people recognized all of them, 6 people recognized more than 900 characters, 8 people recognized more than 700 characters, and 4 people recognized 300 to 600 characters. The low and uneven effect can be seen from this. However, this result was obtained by testing the first few units, on the basis that the students had already recognized 200 to 300 characters. If the later units were tested, this result could not be guaranteed. For example, the grease workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant temporarily selected four students to test some new characters in the fifth unit. As a result, only one person recognized half of them, and the other three only recognized about one-third.
    It should be pointed out that the problem of guaranteeing teaching time is not fundamentally impossible to solve. The key lies in whether the leadership attaches due importance to the promotion of the quick literacy method. In fact, this problem has already been solved in many places. How did they solve this problem? The main methods are:
    First, establish institutions, improve organizations, unify understanding, and unify steps. Benxi Coal Mine Baozha Pit, Benxi No. 1 Power Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company Machinery General Factory and other units, according to the suggestions of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's illiteracy eradication work conference, established an illiteracy eradication committee. At the meeting of the illiteracy eradication committee, an illiteracy eradication plan was formulated, the reasons for not being able to guarantee study time in the past were analyzed, and the solution to this problem was determined. After the study time was determined, the Party, government, labor union, and youth league issued a joint notice, instructing the grassroots units to comply. It is stipulated that study time shall not be occupied under any circumstances without the approval of the director of the illiteracy eradication committee. Secondly, some units also appointed special personnel to control study time. For example, Benxi Coal Mine Baozha Pit specifically had the personnel pit manager control study time and study attendance, so study time was well guaranteed.
    Second, determine the time for meetings and activities, appropriately separate study and meetings, and avoid conflicts. For example, in the past, the labor union of Benxi No. 1 Power Plant often held meetings from 3:00 to 4:00 pm or 4:00 to 5:00 pm every day. Now, it is changed to hold meetings after class. In the past, the Youth League held life criticism meetings from 3:00 to 4:00 pm every Thursday, and held a League members' meeting on the 2nd and 16th of each month. Now, in order to take care of study, the former is moved to 6:00 pm and the latter is moved to 9:00 to 11:00 am on Sunday. The meeting times of other meetings such as Party group meetings and factory management committees have also been adjusted. Benxi Coal Mine Baozha Pit studies six times a week, for a total of nine hours. It is stipulated that workers arrive at school two hours before going to work. The first one and a half hours is for study time, and the remaining half hour is for meetings. As for the plenary meeting, it is held on "public holidays" before noon. Anshan Iron and Steel Company Machinery General Factory and Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau No. 4 Factory and other units study five times a week, and another day is for Party and League activities. If a plenary meeting must be held on a study day, it can be supplemented by switching the Party and League activity day after obtaining the consent of the relevant departments. After such determination, the conflict between study and meeting activities was resolved.
    Third, streamline meetings. The method of streamlining meetings in Benxi Coal Mine and other units is: to count the number of meetings, and convene meetings that can be merged according to the nature and content of the meetings; at the same time, it is stipulated that full preparations must be made before the meeting to avoid wasting time. In this way, the number of meetings is reduced and the time for each meeting is shortened. Some meetings that do not require the participation of all workers are conveyed to the workers by the participating class and group leaders.
    The serious situation of reducing the teaching effect due to the failure to guarantee teaching time must be quickly corrected. In all places where conditions permit the promotion of the quick literacy method, the leading organs should overcome all difficulties and guarantee a minimum of eight hours of teaching time per week. Only in this way can the work of eradicating illiteracy proceed smoothly.

    充分保证工人的学习时间，防止降低速成识字法的教学效果
    杨礼升
    采用速成识字法推行扫除文盲工作，除了要做好思想准备、组织准备，要使教员都能真正领会和掌握速成识字法的精神和教学方法外，还必需切实保证足够的教学时间。因为速成识字法的教学方法的基本特点之一，就是让学员高度集中精力，在连续的、集中的时间内，实行短促突击学习；如果把时间拖长，就要分散学员的精力，影响他们的情绪，从而降低了教学效果。
    东北地区自推行扫除文盲工作以来，由于各级领导机关的重视和支持，保证教学时间这个问题一般都得到了很好的解决。如沈阳市机械系统推行速成识字法的单位，最低的学习时间是每周八至十小时，五厂和二十三厂则有十二小时；本溪市在推行速成识字法的四十九个班中，有三十八个班都可保证每周八至十二小时的学习时间。本溪煤矿宝炸坑和机械三厂在三四个月中，因为推广先进经验，进行保安大检查和国庆节宣传，才占用了三次学习时间；机械四厂也占用过学习时间，但事后即以其他时间补足了；本溪第一发电厂在整个突击教学阶段则始终保持了经常学习。
    但是另一方面，也有些单位由于领导方面对推行速成识字法开展扫除文盲工作的重大意义认识不足，对速成识字法的基本教学精神体会不够，因此不能保证教学时间。这有许多表现形式，有的把每周学习时间规定得过少，不能满足教学要求。例如铁路系统的安东区一般每周只有四小时半的学习时间；中长区有百分之三十的单位每周只学习三小时。时间比较充分的吉林、锦州等区，一般每周也只有六至八小时。在林业系统，一般也是学习时间不足，如吉林等地每周只有六小时。有的单位对职工学习的领导表现了先紧后松的现象，原先所定时间都很充分，但中途因不能完成生产任务，需要更多时间开会解决生产问题，就随便缩减学习时间。如本溪钢厂原来每周学习十个小时，被抽去四个小时；沈阳化工厂的硬化油车间和油脂车间，原来每周学习十二个小时，被缩减了八小时。有时甚至于缩减了的时间还不能保证。如油脂车间名义上是每周学习两次，但有会就开会，没有会才临时用广播通知学习，因此，这两次学习也就不能保证了。本溪钢厂有的车间干部因当天生产任务没有完成，到点不让工人下班；有的在学习时间，随便把工人叫去开会。从这些情况看来，学习时间不充分和没有保证的现象，还是相当严重地存在着。
    不能保证教学时间所造成的损失是很严重的。从教学方法看，这是违背速成识字法的教学精神的。由于时间的限制，教员不得不把课堂教学时间的大部或全部用在突击教学上。也是由于时间的限制，教员既不能在课前了解学员的学习情况，在课堂上就不能针对学员的思想情况进行宣传鼓动。而分段教学方法（分段突击，分段复习，分段巩固）也不能运用，预定要教的生字一次突击下来，中间只有很少或完全没有小组复习活动，辅导员也就失去应有的辅导作用。这样，课堂教学便形成“教员讲，学员听”，而和旧的教学方法实质上就没有什么差异。
    其次，因为每周的学习时间太少，教学进度缓慢，就加倍地拖长了总的教学时间。照沈阳化工厂硬化油车间和油脂车间的平均教学进度看，教完一个单元，需要十多次教学，五、六周以上的时间；如此，一个单元从开头到结束，时间相隔一个多月，前面学的到后面就要忘掉。为了巩固学习成果，就需要经常抽出时间进行阶段复习和单元复习；先后突击的全部生字，也须要经常复习。因此，除了前面那样的复习以外，还要进行从头至尾的循环复习，如是生字学得愈多，循环复习的时间也就愈长。据本溪钢厂统计：第四单元教完以后，从第一单元复习起用了九小时；第五单元教完，除复习本单元外，从头复习花了七小时。沈阳化工厂硬化油车间在教完第六单元时，本单元的复习连同总复习估计需二十次。这样旷日费时，效果反而要降低。关于具体教学进度，可从本溪钢厂压钢车间教员李润田的教学情况看出来，他教五百个字，约花五十个小时，平均每小时进度是十个多字。如此，教完两千个字，就得二百个小时左右。这只是就突击生字而言。如果加上注音字母和阅读写话的教学时间，则单是突击阶段（从注音字母到阅读写话）就要一年以上或将近两年的时间（以每月二十四小时，每年三百小时计）。这样，是一点“速成”的气味也没有了。
    第三，由于时间的限制，学员在课堂上不能充分复习，学了记不住，就影响了学习情绪；教学总时间太长，学员感到学习没有个头，因而对速成识字法产生怀疑，失去信心。如沈阳化工厂硬化油车间工人李宝春就曾经这样问教员：“你不是说两个多月就能扫除文盲吗？为什么现在才学了这么些字？这样
    一年也学不完，还叫什么速成！”本溪钢厂的工人也反应：速成识字法还不如从前的老办法，那时候一天教几个字，还能“四会”，那才是速成呢。因此，学员精神涣散，学习情绪不高。本溪钢厂有的工人下班以后，换了衣服洗了澡，看看已经过了二十分钟，就索性不去学习了；还未下课，有的学员就向车站跑，准备搭车回家。沈阳化工厂硬化油车间有的工人迳直就把学习忘了，有的不经请假就缺课。因而出席率很低。本溪钢厂制钢车间原有二百零七名学员，据十月统计，经常学习的已不到一百人了。
    在教学时间不能保证的情况下，教学效果如何呢？我们看看下面的测验成绩吧：本溪钢厂测验了六百三十一个字，认识五百字以上的人占百分之六十一，识四百字以上的占百分之十，识三百字以上的占百分之六，识三百字以下的占百分之二十三。沈阳化工厂油脂车间二十五人测验一千一百八十四个字，全识的有七人，识九百字以上的有六人，识七百字以上的有八个人，识三百字到六百字的有四人。其效果之低和不平衡于此可见一斑。然而，这个成绩，还是测验前面几个单元，在学员原已认识二三百字的基础上获得的，若测验后面几个单元，则这个成绩还不能保证。如沈阳化工厂油脂车间曾临时抽调四名学员测验第五单元的部分生字，结果只有一个人认识一半，其余三人都只认识三分之一左右。
    应当指出，保证教学时间的问题，并不是根本不可能解决的。关键在于领导方面是否对推行速成识字法予以应有的重视。事实上，这个问题已经在许多地方解决了。他们是怎样解决这个问题的呢？主要的方法是：
    第一，建立机构，健全组织，统一认识，统一步调。本溪煤矿宝炸坑、本溪第一发电厂、鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂等单位，根据中共鞍山市委会扫除文盲工作会议的建议，成立了扫除文盲委员会。在扫除文盲委员会的会议上，订出扫除文盲计划，分析了过去不能保证学习时间的原因，确定了解决这一问题的办法。在学习时间确定之后，党、政、工、团即以联合通知形式，指示基层单位遵照执行。规定未经扫除文盲委员会主任委员的批准，在任何情况下均不得占用学习时间。其次，有的单位还指派专人掌握学习时间，如本溪煤矿宝炸坑即由人事坑长专门掌握学习时间及学习出勤情况，因此学习时间就得到了很好的保证。
    第二，确定会议活动时间，适当地将学习和会议分开，不使冲突。例如本溪第一发电厂，过去工会经常在每天午后三时至四时或四时至五时开会，现在改为下课以后开会。青年团过去在每星期四午后三时至四时开生活检讨会，在每月二日和十六日开团员大会，现在为了照顾学习，前者挪至午后六时开，后者挪至星期日上午九时至十一时开。其他如党小组会、工厂管理委员会等的开会时间也分别作了调整。本溪煤矿宝炸坑每周学习六次，共九小时，规定工人上班前两小时到校，前一个半小时为学习时间，其余半小时则作开会之用。至于全体大会，均在“公休日”午前召开。鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂及东北机械工业管理局第四厂等单位，每周学习五次，另外
    一天为党团活动日。如大会须在学习日召开时，经有关部门同意之后，便将党团活动日对调，予以补足。经过这样确定之后，解决了学习和会议活动的冲突。
    第三，精简会议。本溪煤矿等单位精简会议的办法是：把会议次数统计一下，根据会议性质和内容，可以合并的即合并召开；同时规定会前一定要作充分准备，免得浪费时间。这样就减少了会议的次数和缩短了每次开会的时间。有些不需要全体工人参加的会，则由参加会的班、组长向工人传达会议内容。
    由于不能保证教学时间而减低教学效果的严重情况，必须迅速纠正。凡是有条件推行速成识字法的地方，领导机关应当克服一切困难，保证最低每周给予八小时教学时间。只有这样，才能使扫除文盲的工作顺利进行。
