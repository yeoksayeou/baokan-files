Brief News on Promoting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" System
Shanxi Province's Work in Promoting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" System is Changing Rapidly

    At the Party's Model Propagandist Conference held in December last year, Shanxi Province introduced the experience of Weishe Village in Pingding County in establishing the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized in this year's propaganda network work plan that Party branches throughout the province should universally promote this system and stipulated that by October 1st, all villages with Party branches should establish the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. Party committees at all levels formulated plans, mobilized and deployed the system at various Party meetings, and organized Party district and village cadres to discuss and study documents related to the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. Some regions also organized village cadres and mass representatives to visit typical villages that had established the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, and then launched propaganda and mobilization work among the masses to establish this system. By the end of April, nearly a thousand Party branches in 51 counties across the province had led the masses to establish the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. In the villages where the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system has been established, the formalism of the patriotic covenants has been corrected, and all kinds of work are changing rapidly with the inspection and revision of the patriotic covenants.

    More than a Thousand Villages in Handan Prefecture Established "Patriotic Inspection Day"

    This year, the rural areas of Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, have universally promoted the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. According to incomplete statistics, 1,327 villages in seven counties have established "Patriotic Inspection Day." Daming County launched a mass appraisal campaign of "comparing mutual aid and comparing patriotism" through "Patriotic Inspection Day," consolidating and developing the cooperative mutual aid movement. This year, the county organized more than 6,400 mutual aid groups and 270 agricultural production cooperatives. The patriotic covenants of various villages have been continuously inspected and revised through "Patriotic Inspection Day," overcoming the problem of formalism. All kinds of work are arranged and inspected through "Patriotic Inspection Day," and the masses are mobilized to launch competitions, giving play to collective strength, and also strengthening the initiative and planning of village cadres in their work, smoothly completing the work of each period.

    Heilongjiang Province Will Universally Promote the "Patriotic Inspection Day" System

    At the propaganda work conference held in June this year, Heilongjiang Province summarized the experience of piloting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system in Fuhai Village, Nehe County, and listed the promotion of "Patriotic Inspection Day" as one of the propaganda tasks for the second half of the year, requiring the district committees of the Communist Party of China in each county to first obtain pilot experience and universally promote it in the autumn and winter seasons. According to statistics in mid-October, 153 district committees (40% of the total number of districts) in various counties have piloted the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system in 186 villages. The masses unanimously praised the "Patriotic Inspection Day" as good. They said: With "Patriotic Inspection Day," work has a goal and momentum. The Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has summarized the experience of focusing on piloting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, requiring it to be universally promoted throughout the province in the first half of 1953.

    Village Cadres and Masses in Zhejiang are Very Satisfied with "Patriotic Inspection Day"

    More than a dozen cities and counties in Zhejiang Province, such as Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Haining, and Jiashan, have promoted the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. The chairman of the Farmers' Association of Hongxi Township, Jiashan County, said: "In the past, cadres leading the masses was like pulling a tow rope, which was very laborious; now with 'Patriotic Inspection Day,' it is like raising the sail with the wind, just hold the helm steady." In the past, Chenjia Village, Jiashan, had to hold seven or eight villagers' meetings every month. At present, except for the monthly two "Patriotic Inspection Day" meetings and emergency tasks that must be held, no more meetings are held. The masses are very satisfied. They said: With Patriotic Inspection Day, fewer meetings are held, and the work is done well.

    Street Residents in Jinzhou Established "Patriotic Inspection Day"

    After studying the experience of establishing the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system in rural areas of Shanxi by the Propaganda Department of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the district committees, at the beginning of July, the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system was piloted in seven key resident groups in four districts. In the pilot project, this system was loved and supported by the masses. In the summary of the pilot experience, the Propaganda Department of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee believed that the Patriotic Inspection Day is a very good form for educating the masses, organizing the masses, and promoting work in the streets. First, it strengthens the democratic life of street residents and enhances the sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm of citizens; second, it enables residents to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and strengthens the unity, organization, and discipline of residents; third, it guarantees the regularization of street propaganda work; fourth, all street work can be implemented through patriotic covenants. Since September, Jinzhou has continued to promote this system in a focused manner.

    山西省推行“爱国检查日”制度工作日新月异
    山西省在去年十二月召开的党的模范宣传员会议上，介绍了平定县维社村建立“爱国检查日”制度的经验。中共山西省委在今年的宣传网工作计划中，强调指出要全省党支部普遍推行这种制度，并规定到十月一日，凡是有党支部的村庄都要把“爱国检查日”制度建立起来。各级党委作出了计划，先后在党的各种会议上作了动员和布置，并组织党的区、村干部讨论和学习了有关“爱国检查日”制度的文件，有的地区还组织村干部和群众代表到已建立“爱国检查日”制度的典型村庄去参观，然后在群众中展开宣传动员工作，建立这种制度。到四月底，全省已有五十一县的近千个党支部领导群众建立了“爱国检查日”制度。在建立了“爱国检查日”制度的村庄，爱国公约的形式主义毛病已经得到纠正，各种工作都随着爱国公约的检查修订而日新月异。
    邯郸专区千余村庄建立了“爱国检查日”
    河北省邯郸专区农村今年普遍推行了“爱国检查日”制度。据不完全统计，在七个县里已有一千三百二十七个村庄建立了“爱国检查日”。大名县通过“爱国检查日”开展了“比互助、比爱国”的群众性评比运动，巩固、发展了合作互助运动。今年这个县组织了六千四百多个互助组和二百七十个农业生产合作社。各村的爱国公约经过“爱国检查日”的不断检查修订，克服了形式主义的毛病。各种工作都通过“爱国检查日”来进行布置和检查，并发动群众展开竞赛，发挥了集体力量，也使村干部在工作上加强了主动性和计划性，顺利地完成了各个时期的工作。
    黑龙江省将普遍推行“爱国检查日”制度
    黑龙江省在今年六月举行的宣传工作会议上，总结了在讷河县富海村试行“爱国检查日”制度的经验，把推行“爱国检查日”列为全省下半年宣传工作任务之一，要求各县的中共区委员会首先取得试办经验，在秋冬两季普遍推广。据十月中旬统计，各县已有一百五十三个区委（占总区数百分之四十）在一百八十六个村试办了“爱国检查日”制度。群众一致赞扬“爱国检查日”好。他们说：有了“爱国检查日”，工作有了奔头，也有了劲头。中共黑龙江省委宣传部已总结了重点试行“爱国检查日”制度的经验，要求在一九五三年上半年普遍推行到全省。
    浙江乡村干部群众对“爱国检查日”很满意
    浙江省的萧山、绍兴、海宁、嘉善等十几个市县已推行“爱国检查日”制度。嘉善县洪溪乡的农会主任说：“过去干部领导群众好比拉纤，很吃力；现在有了‘爱国检查日’，好像顺风扯篷，只要掌稳舵就行了。”嘉善陈家村过去每月要开七、八次村民大会，目前除了按月两次“爱国检查日”大会及突击任务必须开会外，就不再开会了。群众很满意，他们说：有了爱国检查日，开会开得少，工作又做得好。
    锦州市街道居民建立“爱国检查日”
    中共锦州市委宣传部和各区委在研究了山西农村建立“爱国检查日”制度的经验之后，七月初开始，在四个区的七个重点居民组中，试行了“爱国检查日”制度。在试点中，这种制度得到群众的喜爱和拥护。锦州市委宣传部在试点经验总结中认为爱国检查日在街道中是教育群众、组织群众、推动工作的很好形式，第一，它加强街道居民的民主生活，提高市民的主人翁责任感和工作积极性；第二、使居民掌握批评与自我批评的武器，加强居民的团结和组织性、纪律性；第三、使街道宣传工作经常化有了保证；第四、使街道的一切工作都可以通过爱国公约来贯彻。九月份起，锦州市已有重点地继续推广这种制度。
