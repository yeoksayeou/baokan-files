    The thousands of miles of national defense border in Yunnan is beautiful and rich. This is where the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups live. Before liberation, imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits carried out many evil activities here, causing serious disasters to the people of all ethnic groups.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1949, the people of all ethnic groups overthrew the common enemy – the imperialist running dog Kuomintang bandits – and began to step into a new era of national unity, peace, and happiness. But American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang were unwilling to let the people of all ethnic groups live good lives. As early as 1949, near liberation, the American spy, Permanent Life, disguised as a "missionary," supplied a large number of weapons to counter-revolutionaries in the rear of the people's guerrillas led by the Chinese Communist Party in the Lancang County area, harassing, killing, and burning the people of all ethnic groups. When the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Yunnan to pursue and wipe out the remaining Chiang bandits, the bandits who escaped immediately fled abroad. Under the direction of American imperialism, they entrenched themselves in the border areas and constantly disturbed our border areas. In the summer of 1951, the remaining bandits fled into the country from the Kawa Mountains, harassing the border counties, killing, setting fires, robbing property, and sabotaging production everywhere. In Jinping County, in the first district alone, more than 130 head of cattle were robbed, and more than 30 people were killed. In Changyan, Banana Ridge, and Changfang Villages in Yuanyang County, more than 150 head of cattle were robbed, and more than 90 houses were burned down. The vast border areas suffered severely from banditry.

    The people of all ethnic groups and the leaders of all ethnic groups who were in contact with the masses were not frightened by the banditry. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to carry out large-scale suppression of bandits, basically eliminating bandits and special agents in the vast border areas, stabilizing social order, and achieving significant victories.

    In the past three years, people of all ethnic groups in various places have consciously organized militia joint defense teams. The militia joint defense team of a certain special zone accounts for 3.9 percent of the total population of the zone, and the militia of a certain county accounts for 10 percent of the population. In order to be ready to fight off possible intrusions by the remaining Chiang bandits, the people of all ethnic groups in the Pu'er Special Zone prepared to support the front line and automatically organized powerful stretcher teams, transportation teams, and intelligence networks. Under the general slogan of defending the country, the militia joint defense teams put forward specific defense slogans according to the specific conditions in various places and at various times, such as "Defending Spring Ploughing," "Defending Autumn Harvest," "Protecting Transportation," "Protecting Ferry Crossings," and so on. The militia joint defense team in the Jiangwai District of Mengzi, in addition to cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in suppressing large groups of bandits, was able to take the initiative to eliminate small groups of scattered bandits, eliminating a total of 374 bandit leaders and bandits, capturing 264 bandits, arresting 53 special agents, and winning over 367 people to surrender. Last year, the militia joint defense team in Yuanyang County fought more than 70 battles with bandits, killing more than 150 bandits below the rank of battalion commander, capturing 28 bandits, and seizing 2 machine guns, more than 100 rifles, and 10 pistols. The militia armed forces in the Baoshan Special Zone captured more than 800 bandits, 34 heads of reactionary secret societies, and 80 special agents, seizing 293 rifles and short guns, 92 locally made guns, 10 machine guns, and more than 6,800 rounds of ammunition.

    In the struggle against the American-Chiang bandits and special agents, many militia heroes and heroic deeds emerged from the people of all ethnic groups. Zhang Shuyang, a young Pula militia member in Pingbian County, resisted the siege of more than 40 bandits alone in July 1951. The bandits were helpless and finally cruelly tied up his parents and wife to kill them, threatening him to surrender. He angrily scolded: "What I am defending is the people of the whole village. Killing my family will not cut off Zhang Shuyang's heart!" He kept shooting and throwing grenades at the bandits, killing several bandits in a row, and finally repelled the bandits. Li Wanxing, a young man of the Duota ethnic group, was once surrounded by 40 or 50 bandits in a house. He killed three bandits in a row. The house was on fire, and he was suffocated by the smoke and flames, but he continued to fight. The bandits thought he was burned to death. When they reached in to drag his gun, he shot and killed the bandit. He resisted from dawn to noon. Finally, the troops arrived and completely wiped out the bandits. Yang Zilin, a Yi militia captain and Communist Party member, went deep into Li Muming's banditry alone to publicize the lenient policy of the People's Government to Li Muming with righteous words and stern expressions, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, and making Li Muming surrender with machine guns and small cannons. The Yi-Han militia squadron led by Bai Gaoyi learned the tactics of relentless pursuit and searched the mountains more than 100 times in the past year. An Aini joint defense team in Jinping County defended the autumn harvest in 1952 and fought against a large group of bandits, killing Tang Mingxian, the deputy commander of the bandit detachment.

    Women and children of all ethnic groups were also mobilized to participate in the bandit suppression work. Li Dama, a 93-year-old Miao woman in Jiangwai, Mengzi Special Zone, saw the bandit leader Huang Laoliu passing through the grassland. She reported to the People's Liberation Army and led the way herself, capturing the Huang bandit alive and seizing a machine gun and two rifles. Jin Meidong, the captain of the women's joint defense team in Hekou, captured the fugitive bandit Wei Youcai; Liu Yufen, a female informant and production model in the joint defense team, immediately carried her baby on her back to report to the joint defense team no matter how late at night or in rainy weather. Shi Fuchang, a 15-year-old Yi child, cleverly dragged back the bandits' guns after being captured by the bandits. Gong Dama, a 56-year-old Dai woman from Lian Shan Man Yun Town, assisted the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits. While working as a translator, she also publicized the bandit suppression policy combining suppression and leniency to the families of the bandits, educating the families of the bandits, and striving for the self-reformation of the bandits. She won over a total of 49 bandits to surrender and seized 16 guns.

    Under the leadership of Li Guangbao and Li Zhapo, the Lahu militia in Yong'an District, Lancang County, repelled the attacks of the remaining bandits nine times. The five militia members, Zhani, Zhafa, Zhashuai, Zhaha, and Zhatuo, from Nanzha Village in Nanka District, killed four remaining bandits with fire tongs and firewood, seizing five small carbines and four hand grenades. Lancang County also saw the emergence of militia heroes such as Li Bingzhang, Long Laosan, Zhang Zhaduo, Li Laoer (Lahu), and Ma Yuncai (Hui). In the autumn of 1951, when American imperialism instigated the remaining Chiang bandits to invade Lancang, people of all ethnic groups cooperated fully with the People's Liberation Army. The Lahu militia member Li Bingzhang led five militia members to kill three enemies and guarded a large wooden bridge, a traffic artery. District chief Zhake of Menglian led the militia to kill five remaining bandits, injure eleven, and seize a pistol, protecting the safety of the entire village. Bu Genong, an 80-year-old Dai hero, also persisted in fighting the remaining bandits when they harassed the area.

    In the struggle against the American-Chiang bandits, the heroic spirit of the people of all ethnic groups was fully demonstrated. Li Bao, a 70-year-old man from Lancang County who had been to Beijing, and Li Zhangda from Xinyingpan District, Ningjiang, were captured by bandits and subjected to cruel torture. They both vowed not to surrender to the enemy and finally shouted: "Follow the Chinese Communist Party forever" and "Long live Chairman Mao" before dying heroically. Gong Zhawa, a militia member from Ningjiang, used a wooden stick to fight the remaining bandits in a night raid, wounding three bandits and capturing one alive. Finally, he also died heroically.

    Because the people of all ethnic groups loved the motherland and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to carry out a heroic and tenacious struggle against the American-Chiang bandits and special agents, they not only gave the remaining bandits a severe blow and defended the border land, but also tempered the various ethnic groups into a strong armed force to defend the motherland's border in the battle.

    The ability of the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan to unite and fight the enemy bravely is inseparable from the correct ethnic policies implemented by the Party and the People's Government. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. In the past three years, the People's Government has given the fraternal ethnic groups tremendous help and meticulous care in all aspects, thus strengthening national unity and greatly improving the lives of the people of all ethnic groups. At the beginning of liberation, some fraternal ethnic groups mistakenly believed rumors and were suspicious of the People's Liberation Army and the working cadres of the People's Government. However, the People's Liberation Army and the cadres working in the border areas widely carried out national unity work in the midst of tense battles and work, "doing good things" for the people of all ethnic groups, helping the people of all ethnic groups produce, carrying water, cooking, washing clothes, and repairing houses, and treating diseases and vaccinating the people of all ethnic groups, so that the people of all ethnic groups gradually eliminated their doubts and became close to us, even as intimate as a family. More than 90 percent of the native chieftains who had been deceived and coerced by the Chiang bandits into joining the enemy have also returned to the embrace of the motherland.

    In order to strengthen national unity, realize national equality, and more effectively and quickly help the people of all ethnic groups develop politically, economically, and culturally, the People's Government began to carry out ethnic democratic construction in March 1951. In the five border special zones alone, there are six counties, one district, and fifty-nine townships that have implemented regional autonomy; there are four special zones, eighteen counties, twenty-four districts, and one hundred and twenty-five townships that have established joint governments.

    In the past three years, the People's Government has carried out vigorous relief work for the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas, helping the people of all ethnic groups restore production, develop trade, and carry out health and cultural and educational work. In 1951 alone, more than 2 billion yuan in relief grain and funds were distributed in Yuanyang and Honghe counties. The cadres and troops stationed in the fraternal ethnic areas also tightened their belts, built houses, sent grain and salt, and bought cattle, farm tools, and seeds for the people of the fraternal ethnic groups.

    In order to increase the purchasing power of the people of the fraternal ethnic groups, in 1951, the state-owned trading company put in 7 to 8 billion yuan in Renminbi to purchase native products and special products such as ramie, saltpeter, tung oil, and tea. In the first half of this year, it put in another 11.8 billion yuan in the five border special zones to purchase native products and special products, and supplied daily necessities, agricultural implements, fertilizers, and seeds worth 18.6 billion yuan at low prices. As a result, the prices of native products and special products have increased, and the prices of daily necessities have relatively decreased. The price of Coptis chinensis produced in the areas inhabited by the Lisu people in Bijiang, Fugong, and Gongshan has increased by 60 percent compared with before liberation. Before liberation, three catties of tea could not be exchanged for one catty of rice in the Pu'er area, and three catties of cotton could not be exchanged for one catty of salt; last year, one catty of tea could be exchanged for three catties of rice, and one catty of cotton could be exchanged for five catties of salt. From January to May this year, the People's Government also supplied more than 12,000 pieces of agricultural implements such as hoes and plowshares to Lancang, Jiangcheng, Cheli, and Fohai counties in the Pu'er Special Zone, and more than 25,000 catties of steel for manufacturing agricultural implements. Since last year, the People's Bank has gone deep into the countryside to issue agricultural loans according to the needs of various ethnic areas, helping the people of all ethnic groups develop agricultural production.

    In order to relieve the fraternal ethnic areas from drought and floods, the People's Government mobilized cadres and troops to help the fraternal ethnic groups build water conservancy projects. In Cheli, a water channel more than 20 li long from Manhe Meng to Manjing Lan was built, which can irrigate 11,810 paddy fields; in Longsa Village, Jinghong District, the Nanbangfa water channel, 30 li long, was built, which can irrigate 12,000 paddy fields; in Wuben District, 16 water channels were built, which can irrigate paddy fields that can produce 14,996 dan of grain; in Mengmeng District, 32 new wells were drilled. Therefore, grain production has increased greatly. In Yingjiang, the Dayingjiang levee, 30 li long, was built, which can protect more than 37,000 mu of farmland from floods and irrigate more than 25,000 mu of farmland. This year, it can increase the production of 4.5 million catties of rice. The People's Government also led the fraternal ethnic groups lacking arable land to reclaim wasteland. A total of 38,331 mu of wasteland were reclaimed in the Lijiang Special Zone.

    The Shantou ethnic group in the Baoshan Special Zone, with the help of the People's Government and the Dai people, went down to the dam to reclaim wasteland for production. The People's Government also provided them with means of production and means of livelihood. Last year, eight households in Longchuan went down to the dam for production and all achieved a bumper harvest. This year, there are 171 Shantou households, 11 Benglong households, and 2 Dai households in Longchuan who have gone down to the dam for production. The People's Government has loaned them a total of 140,000 catties of rice and 41 head of cattle, and helped them build 20 new villages and build 11 water channels that can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields. This year, there are 400 households of Shantou, Lisu, and Achang ethnic groups in Yingjiang who have gone down to the dam for production. The People's Government has loaned them a total of 100.4 million yuan. The People's Liberation Army troops also helped them build houses, plow fields, and teach them various farming techniques. At the same time, the People's Government helped the people of all ethnic groups living in the mountains improve their production techniques on the spot to solve their livelihood problems. The people of the fraternal ethnic groups in Bijiang, Lancang, and other counties did not know how to grow wheat. The People's Government distributed seeds and sent cadres to guide them in growing wheat. This year's wheat harvest greatly improved their lives.

    In order to help the fraternal ethnic groups develop cultural and educational undertakings, the People's Government has reformed and established 14 ethnic middle schools and 3 branch schools after liberation, with a total of 1,016 students from fraternal ethnic groups (excluding Han students); 38 provincial ethnic primary schools, with a total of 5,016 students from fraternal ethnic groups (excluding Han students). The development of county-level ethnic primary schools is even faster. For example, the Pu'er Special Zone had 583 schools with 17,914 students in 1951, which has increased to 683 schools with 50,000 students this year; the Lijiang Special Zone had 947 schools last year and now has 1,226 schools, with the number of students increasing to more than 67,000, and another 31,000 students in literacy classes.

    In order to help the fraternal ethnic groups reduce disease and disaster, the five border special zones have set up five central hospitals, 31 county hospitals, two county medical offices, and hundreds of other small medical institutions and 12 large mobile medical teams, which have greatly alleviated the serious diseases and disasters of the people of the fraternal ethnic groups. In 1951, more than 60,000 people of all ethnic groups in Yuanyang County received free treatment; 260,000 people in the Pu'er Special Zone were vaccinated. As a result, the mortality rate of the people of all ethnic groups has been greatly reduced.

    The People's Government is vigorously training ethnic cadres. In addition to the Yunnan Nationalities Institute, the five border special zones have all set up ethnic cadre training classes. The first phase of 685 students from 40 ethnic groups at the Nationalities Institute has graduated, and the second phase of 712 students from 51 ethnic groups (including the political research class) are studying. Cultural, educational, health, financial, trade, agricultural, and forestry professional institutions have also trained a large number of cadres from the fraternal ethnic groups.

    In addition, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yunnan Provincial People's Government organized an ethnic work team to work in the Baoshan District in June this year. The work team includes working cadres from agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, transportation, construction, epidemic prevention and medical treatment, production and trade, culture and education, iron and wood stone engineering technology, youth, women, mass movement, and other aspects. It goes deep into villages to systematically carry out production and trade and regional autonomy work, and has won the support of the broad masses. The Provincial People's Government is preparing to organize more ethnic work teams to work in the border areas.

    Due to the victory of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits, due to the tremendous help of the People's Government to the fraternal ethnic groups, national unity has been strengthened, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been greatly improved, and their political awareness has also been greatly enhanced. The people of all ethnic groups love their newly born motherland and hate the American-Chiang bandits even more, and thus launched a heroic struggle against the American-Chiang bandits and special agents. Since April last year, the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea has been widely launched in the border areas inhabited by fraternal ethnic groups. The slogan "Resist American Aggression, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country" is closely linked to the struggle against American-Chiang bandits and special agents in the border areas, defending the border of the motherland, defending our hometown, and defending our lives and property. In particular, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation returning home has made communication reports in depth in the border areas twice, which has further strengthened the will of the people of all ethnic groups to "Resist American Aggression, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country." In the Pu'er Special Zone, 44 ethnic groups with more than 750,000 people, accounting for 62.5 percent of the total population of the zone, have received the education of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea. In the Lianshan area of the Baoshan Special Zone, 155 large and small mass meetings were held to publicize the resistance against American aggression and aid Korea, with 14,500 people receiving education, accounting for 41 percent of the total population of the county. People of all ethnic groups in various places also actively participated in the May 1st demonstration parade last year, opposing American imperialism's separate peace with Japan, supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, generally formulating patriotic covenants, carrying out preferential treatment work, launching a production increase movement, and actively carrying out the struggle to eliminate the remaining bandits. Now the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of Yunnan are closely united, working and fighting under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, consolidating the national defense of the motherland, improving their lives, and striving for greater victories on the basis of past victories.

    云南各族人民保卫边疆斗争的胜利
    本报特约记者  侯方岳
    云南数千里的国防边疆是美丽而富饶的。这儿居住着勤劳勇敢的各民族人民。解放以前，帝国主义和国民党匪帮曾在这儿作过许多罪恶活动，给各族人民造成严重的灾难。
    在中国共产党领导下，一九四九年各族人民打倒了共同的敌人——帝国主义走狗国民党匪帮，开始踏进了民族团结与和平幸福的新时代。但美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮是不甘心各族人民过好日子的。还在一九四九年临近解放时，披着“传教士”外衣的美国特务永久生，就在澜沧县一带中国共产党领导的人民游击队后方，以大量武器供给反革命分子，对各族人民进行扰害和烧杀。中国人民解放军入云南追歼残余蒋匪时，漏网残匪即窜出国境，在美帝国主义指使下，盘据在边境地带，并不断扰乱我边疆。一九五一年夏，残匪自卡瓦山窜入国境，扰害边疆各县，到处杀人放火，抢劫财物，破坏生产。仅在金平县一区就抢去耕牛一百三十余头，杀死三十多人。在元阳县的长岩、芭蕉岭、长房三寨抢去耕牛一百五十多头，烧毁房屋九十多间。边疆广大地区都遭受着严重匪灾。
    各族人民及与群众有联系的各族领袖人物，并没有被匪焰所吓倒。他们在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，配合人民解放军进行了大规模剿匪，在边疆广大地区基本肃清了土匪特务，安定了社会秩序，取得了重大胜利。
    三年来，各地各族人民先后自觉地组织了民兵联防队。某专区民兵联防队占全区人口的百分之三点九，某县民兵占人口的百分之十。普洱专区各族人民为了随时迎击可能遭受的残余蒋匪的侵扰，作了支援前线的准备，自动组织了强大的担架队、运输队、情报网。民兵联防队在保家卫国的总口号下，根据各地各时期的具体情况，提出具体的保卫口号，如“保卫春耕”，“保卫秋收”，“保护交通”，“保护渡口”等等。蒙自江外区的民兵联防队，除配合解放军进剿大股匪外，且能主动清剿小股散匪，共歼灭匪首匪徒三七四人，俘匪二六四人，捉特务五十三人，争取三六七人投降。元阳县民兵联防队，去年即与匪作战七十余次，击毙匪营长以下一百五十余名，俘匪二十八名，缴机枪二挺，步枪百余支，手枪十支。保山专区民兵武装，捕捉土匪八百余名，反动会道门头子三十四名，特务八十名，缴获长短枪二九三支，土枪九二支，机枪十挺，子弹六千八百余发。
    各族人民在与美蒋残匪特务斗争中，涌现出许多民兵英雄和英勇壮烈的事迹。屏边县普拉族青年民兵张树扬，一九五一年七月一个人曾抵抗过四十多匪徒的围攻。匪徒无可奈何，最后竟残忍地把他的爹妈和妻子绑起来要杀，威胁他投降。他愤极骂道：“老子保卫的是全寨子的人，杀死我一家人也割不掉我张树扬的心！”他不断向匪徒们射击，掷手榴弹，连续击毙土匪数人，终于把匪徒们击退。堕塔族青年李万兴，一次被四、五十个土匪围在房子里，他连续击毙三个土匪，房子被烧着了，他被烟雾和火苗呛得换不过气来，还继续坚持作战。匪徒以为他被烧死，探进来拖他的枪时，他一枪就把匪徒击毙。他从拂晓抵抗到中午，最后部队赶来，全部歼灭了匪徒。彝族民兵队长、共产党员杨自林曾只身深入李目明匪部，向李目明义正词严地宣传人民政府的宽大政策，晓以利害，使李目明缴出机枪、小炮投降。白高义率领的彝汉族民兵中队，学会了穷追猛打战术，一年来搜山达一百多次。爱尼族某联防队，一九五二年在金平县保卫秋收，迎击大股匪军，击毙了匪支队副司令唐明先。
    各族妇女儿童，也都动员起来，参加了清匪工作。蒙自专区江外九十三岁的苗族李大妈，看见匪首黄老六经过茅草地，她就向解放军报信，自己带路去追，活捉了黄匪，缴获了机枪一挺，步枪二支。河口市区妇女联防中队长金美东，捉住了潜逃匪犯韦有才；联防中的生产模范女情报员刘玉芬只要得了情报，不论深夜或阴雨，都立即背着娃娃向联防队报信。十五岁的彝族儿童施福昌，被匪俘掳后，机智地把土匪的枪拖了回来。莲山蛮允镇五十六岁的傣族龚大妈，协助人民解放军清剿土匪。她一面担任翻译工作，一面又向土匪家属宣传镇压与宽大相结合的剿匪政策，教育土匪家属，争取土匪改造自新。她一共争取了四十九个土匪投降，缴枪十六支。
    澜沧县永安区倮?族民兵在李光保、李扎迫的领导下，曾九次击退残匪进攻，南卡区南扎村的扎尼、扎法、扎帅、扎哈、扎妥五个民兵用火钳柴块打死残匪四人，缴获五支小卡宾枪、四个手榴弹。澜沧县还涌现了李炳章、龙老三、张扎朵、李老二
    （倮?族）马云才（回族）等民兵英雄。一九五一年秋，美帝国主义唆使残余蒋匪进扰澜沧时，各族人民全力配合解放军作战，倮?族民兵李炳章带领着五个民兵打死了三个敌人，守住了一座交通孔道大木桥。孟莲区长扎克带领民兵打死残匪五人，打伤十一人，缴获驳壳枪一支，保护了全村的安全。八十岁的傣族老英雄布格弄在残匪窜扰时，也始终坚持与残匪斗争。
    在对美蒋残匪斗争中，充分表现了各族人民的英雄气概。澜沧县曾赴京的代表七十老人李保、宁江新营盘区李章大被匪捉住后，遭到酷刑拷打，他们都誓不投敌，最后高呼：“永远跟着中国共产党走”，“毛主席万岁”。从容就义。宁江民兵龚扎瓦，在夜袭残匪时，用木棒与残匪肉搏，打伤匪徒三人，活捉一人，最后自己也壮烈牺牲。
    由于各族人民热爱祖国，配合人民解放军对美蒋残匪特务进行了英勇顽强的斗争，不但给予残匪严重的打击，保卫了边疆的土地，同时也使各民族在战斗中锻炼成一支保卫祖国边疆坚强的武装力量。
    云南各民族人民能够团结起来英勇地对敌人进行斗争，是和党与人民政府所执行的正确的民族政策分不开的，这是毛主席的民族政策的伟大胜利。三年来，人民政府从各方面给予了兄弟民族以巨大的帮助和无微不至的照顾，因而加强了民族团结，大大改善了各族人民的生活。解放之初，曾有一部分兄弟民族人民误信谣言，对人民解放军和人民政府的工作干部抱怀疑态度。但是，人民解放军和在边疆区工作的干部，在紧张的战斗和工作中，普遍开展了民族团结工作，为各族人民“作好事”，帮助各族人民生产以及挑水、煮饭、洗衣服和修房屋，并给各族人民治病、种牛痘，使各族人民逐渐消除了疑惧，对我们亲密起来，甚至亲热得像一家人了。深受蒋匪欺骗和胁迫而投敌的某些土司头人，百分之九十以上也已回到祖国怀抱来。
    为了加强民族团结，实现民族平等，更有效更迅速地帮助各族人民发展政治经济文化，人民政府从一九五一年三月开始进行民族民主建政工作。仅边疆五个专区已实行区域自治的有六个县、一个区、五十九个乡；已建立联合政府的有四个专区、十八个县、二十四个区、一百二十五个乡。
    三年来，人民政府对边疆各族人民进行了大力救济，帮助各族人民恢复生产，发展贸易，开展卫生文教工作。仅一九五一年在元阳、红河两县即发放救济粮款二十余亿元。在兄弟民族区工作的干部和驻军也节衣缩食，为兄弟民族人民盖房子、送粮食、盐巴，买耕牛农具种籽。
    为了提高兄弟民族人民的购买力，一九五一年国营贸易公司投放了人民币七、八十亿元收购麻布、火硝、桐油、茶叶……等土产、特产；今年上半年在边疆五个专区又投放了一百一十八亿元收购土产、特产，并廉价供应了价值达一百八十六亿元的日用品及农具、肥料、种籽等。因而提高了土产特产价格，相对地降低了日用品价格。碧江、福贡、贡山傈僳族居住地区出产的黄连价格比解放前提高了百分之六十。解放前在普洱区三斤茶叶换不到一斤米，三斤棉花换不到一斤盐；去年一斤茶叶可换三斤米，一斤棉花可换五斤盐。今年一月至五月，人民政府又供应普洱专区澜沧、江城、车里、佛海等县锄头犁头等农具达一万二千多件，制造农具的钢铁二万五千多斤。从去年起，人民银行根据各民族地区的需要，深入农村发放农贷，帮助各族人民发展农业生产。
    人民政府为了免除兄弟民族地区的旱灾和水灾，动员干部和驻军帮助兄弟民族兴修水利，在车里修好蛮贺勐至蛮井兰长达二十多华里的水渠，可灌溉一万一千八百一十块稻田；在景洪区龙洒村修好了三十华里长的南邦发水渠，可灌溉一万二千块稻田；在务本区修好十六条水渠，可灌溉一万四千九百九十六挑谷的稻田；在勐孟区新打了三十二眼水井。因此粮食产量大增。在盈江修好长达三十华里的大盈江长堤，可使三万七千多亩田免除水灾，二万五千多亩田得到灌溉，今年可增产稻谷四百五十万斤。人民政府并领导缺乏耕地的兄弟民族进行开荒。丽江专区共开荒三万八千三百三十一亩。
    保山专区的山头族，在人民政府和傣族人民的帮助下下埧开荒生产，人民政府并发给他们生产资料与生活资料。去年陇川有八户下埧生产，都得到丰收。今年陇川下埧生产的有山头族一百七十一户，崩龙族十一户，傣族二户，人民政府共贷给大米十四万斤，耕牛四十一头，并帮助他们新建二十个寨，修好可灌溉一万余亩稻田的十一条水渠。盈江今年下埧生产的已有山头、傈僳、阿昌等族四百户，人民政府已贷款给他们一亿零四百万元。解放军部队也帮助他们盖房子、犁田、教他们各种耕作技术。人民政府同时帮助住在山上的各族人民就地改良生产技术，以解决他们的生活问题。碧江、澜沧等县兄弟民族人民不会种小麦，人民政府发给种籽，派干部指导他们种小麦。今年小麦丰收，大大改善了他们的生活。
    为了帮助兄弟民族发展文化教育事业，解放以后人民政府改革和新创了十四个民族中学及三个分校，共有兄弟民族学生一○一六人（汉族学生未计入）；三十八个省立民族小学，共有兄弟民族学生五○一六人（汉族学生未计入）。至于县立民族小学，发展更快。如普洱专区一九五一年有五八三校，学生一七、九一四人，今年已增至六八三校，学生五万人；丽江专区去年有九四七校，现有一二二六校，学生增到六万七千余人，另有识字班学生三万一千余人。
    为了帮助兄弟民族减除病灾，边疆五个专区已设有五个中心医院，三十一个县医院，两个县医务室及其他数百个小型医疗机构和十二个大型的流动医疗队，大大减轻了兄弟民族人民的严重病灾。一九五一年，元阳县各族人民受到免费治疗的达六万余人；普洱一个专区有二十六万人注射了疫苗。因而各族人民死亡率大大降低了。
    人民政府大力培养着民族干部，除云南民族学院外，边疆五个专区都办有民族干部训练班。民族学院第一期四十个民族的六八五个学员已毕业，第二期五十一个民族的七一二个学员（包括政治研究班）正在学习。文教、卫生、财经、贸易、农林各专业机构，也训练了大批的兄弟民族干部。
    此外，中共云南省委与云南省人民政府组织了民族工作队于今年六月到保山区工作。工作队包括农林、水利、交通、建设、防疫医疗、生产贸易、文教、铁木石工技术、青年、妇女、群运等各方面的工作干部，深入村寨，有系统地进行生产贸易和区域自治的工作，获得广大群众的拥护。省人民政府正准备更多地组织这样的民族工作队，到边疆地区进行工作。
    由于人民解放军剿匪的胜利，由于人民政府对兄弟民族的巨大帮助，民族团结加强了，各族人民的生活大大改善了，政治觉悟也大大提高了。各族人民热爱自己新生的祖国，更痛恨美蒋匪帮，因而开展了英勇的反美蒋残匪特务的斗争。从去年四月起，在边疆各兄弟民族地区普遍展开了抗美援朝运动。“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的口号，和边疆反美蒋残匪特务、保卫祖国的边疆、保卫家乡、保卫自己的生命财产的斗争紧密地结合起来。尤其中国人民志愿军归国代表两次深入边疆作传达报告，更加强了各族人民的“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的意志。普洱专区受到抗美援朝教育的有四十四个民族，七十五万多人，占全区人口的百分之六十二点五。保山专区的莲山曾开宣传抗美援朝的大小群众会一五五次，受教育群众一万四千五百人，占全县人口百分之四十一。各地各族人民并积极参加了去年“五一”的示威游行，反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和，拥护五大国缔结和平公约，普遍订立了爱国公约，开展优抚工作，发起增产运动，并积极进行了肃清残匪的斗争。现在云南边疆各族人民正紧密地团结起来，为巩固祖国的国防、为改善自己的生活，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，照着毛主席指示的方向，劳动着，斗争着，在过去胜利的基础上，争取更大的胜利。
