    The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government Should Reasonably Assign Luo Hongda's Work
    To the Editor: In the summer of 1950, after graduating from the Mining Department of the Engineering Institute, I obeyed the unified assignment of the Government Administration Council and went to work in the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government. I am now waiting for work assignment at the Public Security Cadre School and have been waiting for more than four months. For the past two years, I have not done any engineering or technical work, and the mining technology I learned before is completely useless. Continuing to keep me in my current position is a way to gradually make me unfamiliar with and abandon the engineering and technical knowledge that the motherland needs most today. I am a young cadre of New China, and I should respond to the call of the motherland and do the work that the motherland urgently needs. I believe that any practice of stockpiling cadres and simply using the "culture" of technical cadres is inappropriate. At present, in order to strengthen basic construction work, technical cadres from production departments must be transferred to basic construction departments; technical cadres from non-production departments should be transferred to basic construction departments more quickly. I implore the organization to transfer me to a work position that is most urgently needed for the construction of the motherland.    Luo Hongda
    Editor's Note: It is recommended that the Ministry of Public Security accept Comrade Luo Hongda's request and rationally handle his work issue.

    中央人民政府公安部应合理分配罗宏达的工作
    编辑同志：一九五○年夏季，我从工学院采矿系毕业后，服从政务院统一分配，到中央人民政府公安部工作。我现在在公安干部学校等待分配工作，已经四个多月了。两年来，我没有做过任何工程技术方面的工作，以前所学的采矿技术，完全用不上。把我继续放在现在的工作岗位上，是促使我逐渐生疏与放弃祖国今天最需要的工程技术知识的作法。我是新中国的一个青年干部，我应该响应祖国的号召，做祖国最迫切需要的工作。我认为任何储备干部及单纯使用技术干部的“文化”的作法，是不妥当的。目前，为了加强基本建设工作，生产部门的技术干部都必须抽调到基本建设部门中去；非生产部门的技术干部，就更应该迅速抽调到基本建设部门去。恳求组织把我调到祖国建设最迫切需要的工作岗位上去。    罗宏达
    编者按：建议公安部接受罗宏达同志的要求，合理处理他的工作问题。
