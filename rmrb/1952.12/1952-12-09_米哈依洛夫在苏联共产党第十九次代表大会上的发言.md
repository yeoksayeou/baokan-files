Editor's Note: Mikhaylov was formerly the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union and is now a member of the Presidium and Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This article is his speech at the 19th Congress of the CPSU. The original text was published in the Soviet "Pravda" on October 7. The following is a translation of the speech.

Comrades! Comrade Malenkov's report painted a vivid picture of the Leninist-Stalinist party struggling for the victory of communist construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people have achieved a victory of worldwide historical significance. The Soviet youth, like all our people, look back on the path our motherland has traversed with due pride and great joy. Millions of laborers and progressive people in all countries share this joy with us.

The Leninist-Stalinist Komsomol strives to live up to the title of the Communist Party's loyal assistant and combat reserve in all aspects. Comrade Stalin said: "The Komsomol always stands at the forefront of our fighters. I am not aware of any situation where the Komsomol has lagged behind the events of our revolutionary life." Whether in combat—as during the Great Patriotic War—or in labor—during peaceful construction—the Komsomol has always been in step with the Party. In factories and collective farms, on the construction sites of communist projects, and in the work of building protective forest belts—wherever they are, young communist builders are working selflessly. Many outstanding advanced workers have emerged from the youth.

The Party Congress has drawn up a plan for our country's communist construction. A new page is unfolding in the history of Soviet society and the lives of people all over the world.

Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" ideologically armed the Party and the Soviet people, pointing out the path from socialism to communism. Comrade Stalin's work is a brilliant ideological creation that promotes the development of the entire society.

The Komsomol members and all Soviet youth consider it their glorious cause to fight selflessly for the victorious realization of Comrade Stalin's instructions on communist construction. (Stormy applause)

New historical circumstances pose new tasks. We must implement the Komsomol's work in all aspects according to Comrade Stalin's instructions, ensuring a new upsurge in the communist education of the youth. To achieve this, we must make great efforts, overcome many difficulties, and combine the spirit of combat revolutionary heroism with a pragmatic attitude.

Comrade Stalin taught that one of the prerequisites for transitioning to communism is to highly develop social culture to ensure that all members of society can fully develop their physical and mental strength.

Directly related to this is the plan formulated by the Central Committee of the CPSU for the further development of national education and comprehensive technical education. Soviet youth deeply understand that without knowledge and science, it is impossible to successfully build a new society. The vast majority of our youth are studying in ordinary schools, technical schools, universities, and various night schools and correspondence schools. Everyone knows how much our schools have achieved. However, there are still shortcomings in school work: the number of students who are held back is still considerable; a considerable number of students fail in certain subjects; the teaching-ideological education work in some schools is not well organized; and the school buildings in some cities and regions are not sufficient. All of this cannot but make the Party, Soviet, and Komsomol organs feel uneasy.

Teachers play a decisive role in schools. A considerable number of teachers have not received the education they deserve. However, the work of improving the quality of teachers, the organization of correspondence teaching, and the activities of teaching research associations sometimes have significant shortcomings. Everyone has high demands on Soviet educational science, but the work in this area is obviously lagging behind the requirements, and well-written educational textbooks have not been compiled. The work of researching and summarizing the experience of advanced teachers is also not being carried out well. The Academy of Educational Sciences has not provided answers to many important questions, has not published informative works, and has not done enough to revise some textbooks. The Party and Soviet organs must devote due effort to this extremely important cause of national education.

Regrettably, not all Party organs are closely studying the various problems of schools. For example, the Central Committee of the CPSU drew the attention of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan to the significant shortcomings existing in school work, but these shortcomings have been corrected very slowly. There are still semi-literate people in this republic, the universal compulsory education plan has not been implemented, there are still students who are eliminated, especially female students, and the work of many night schools for young workers and peasants is also not being carried out well.

At the Communist Party Congress of this republic, Comrade Razakov, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan, should have admitted that the leadership of the Party and Soviet organs of the republic over national education was unsatisfactory. This criticism will probably first cause the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan to strengthen its concern for schools and teachers.

From the perspective of the new tasks, it is necessary to make the issue of educating youth and improving the cultural level of youth the central issue of concern for the Komsomol. It is our duty to ensure that Komsomol members and Young Pioneers play an advanced role in learning; to regularly assist school principals, teachers, and class teachers in their teaching work; and to actively participate in all work to promote universal secondary education (ten-year system) and comprehensive technical education, train new teachers, and strengthen the material equipment for school teaching.

The Komsomol should also work more actively in universities to help the Party train new skilled higher experts from the youth.

Comrade Stalin's works on linguistics and political economy have repeatedly pointed out the great power of advanced revolutionary science. The Komsomol should ensure that young experts in any field of knowledge tirelessly learn to master the theories of Lenin and Stalin. Make studying revolutionary science a daily need for the youth.

Every social era produces the heroes of that era. The socialist era has also produced various heroes. The hero of our time is the Soviet patriot who is wholeheartedly loyal to the Leninist-Stalinist cause, an active builder of communism. Soviet youth are being developed and cultivated into comprehensive, harmonious individuals in all aspects. Possessing noble moral qualities, tirelessly working for the welfare of the people, tirelessly thirsting for culture, science, and all kinds of knowledge, regularly engaging in sports, and actively participating in social activities—these are the characteristics of young Soviet people in our time.

However, we cannot fail to notice other facts that prove the influence of hostile classes attempting to contaminate the youth. Old remnants in people's minds are still showing themselves. There are still incidents of young workers violating labor discipline in some factories. Among the youth in both cities and villages, there are still idlers and those who violate the rules of socialist public life. There are also some young men and women who are influenced by religion.

The Komsomol Central Committee has serious shortcomings in its leadership of the ideological education work of the youth. The education work is often carried out in a way that is poor in content, formalistic, and makes the youth feel bored. This work is extremely lax in many Komsomol organizations. Conducting communist education for the youth has always been the main task of the Komsomol. Now, in the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, the significance of education work is even greater. The Komsomol must follow the instructions of the Party Congress and Comrade Stalin to fully improve the ideological education work of the youth masses and cultivate the younger generation in the spirit of communism. We must resolutely eliminate the shortcomings in ideological education work and raise this work to the level required by the new tasks. Undoubtedly, the Party organizations will fully assist the Komsomol in this regard.

Comrade Malenkov also mentioned literature and art a lot in his report. Soviet youth love and cherish outstanding Soviet literature and art, an important weapon in the struggle for communism.

In recent years, many excellent works have been produced, which is the pride of our people. These works play a major role in cultivating the communist ideology of the youth, but some writers are still publishing crude, unthinking works. They are lagging behind reality, and their creations ignore many important aspects of the youth's labor, study, and life.

There are also few good works in the Soviet theater world that depict our socialist life. Only two of the plays published last year won the Stalin Prize, which powerfully illustrates the poor situation in the playwriting world. But the mission of the playwriting world is to assist in the education of the younger generation. The Council of the Soviet Writers' Union and the Art Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers have held dozens of meetings, large and small, to discuss the reasons for the backwardness of the Soviet playwriting world. A large number of articles have also been published on this issue. However, sometimes people have the impression that some playwrights have completely stopped writing plays and are mainly writing articles explaining why there are no plays about Soviet life (whole audience roars with laughter).

Young people often raise some very fair criticisms, saying that the work of the Soviet Film Department has serious shortcomings, and the department has not created many good films that depict Soviet reality. The leaders of the Soviet Film Department and the Soviet Writers' Union not only acknowledge these shortcomings but are also constantly discussing how to correct this situation. At the same time, the Film Department complains to the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union that there are not enough good film scripts. The Council of the Soviet Writers' Union criticizes the Film Department. The two sides argue endlessly, but few good films are created.

The Party teaches us that it is not enough to just acknowledge the shortcomings, but we should also learn to correct them. Now is the time for the Film Department, the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union, and the Art Committee to answer the criticism with practical actions. This will bring many benefits to the cause of communist education of the youth. The youth will accept excellent new works of Soviet literature, art, and film with great respect and gratitude.

The Party teaches the Komsomol to combine every step of its study and education with the practical tasks of building a new society. The Komsomol will more actively launch socialist competitions among the youth to respond to the resolutions of the Party Congress. Komsomol members and youth in various industrial sectors will strive to increase production, improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, and improve product quality. Komsomol members and youth in rural areas will strive to increase the yields of various crops, further develop public animal husbandry, and improve the work of collective farms, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations.

It should be said that the beneficial initiatives of young model workers are not always given the necessary support. For example, Stalin Prize winners, young workers Comrades Zhikov and Chekilev, etc., with the active help of engineers and technicians, greatly increased the speed of metal cutting, and high-speed cutting methods brought out the great potential of lathes. However, some government departments, such as the Soviet Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing, did not really support this cause. The ministry failed to complete the plan to promote high-speed cutting methods year after year. Now it seems that the ministry's workers have decided not to make such a plan at all. They mistakenly believe that this will allow them to live a more peaceful life.

Comrade Malenkov talked about the issue of economizing on resources. According to the initiative of the youth, the Stalin Automobile Factory adopted various beneficial measures and saved nearly 3,000 tons of metal in the first half of this year. It is not difficult to imagine how huge amounts of metal would be saved if the whole country used metal more economically. Using metal beyond the quota, cutting it wastefully, and discarding large parts are all common phenomena in many factories. A resolute struggle should be declared against waste, and the slogan of economy should be firmly implemented in life.

The Party and Comrade Stalin constantly teach us not to compromise with shortcomings. If a Komsomol member finds a shortcoming, then he should strive to eliminate it. If the Komsomol organization knows that, for example, there are careless problems in the work of a certain collective farm, and there are violations of the charter of agricultural labor cooperatives—unfortunately, this phenomenon is common—, then it should strive to eliminate these shortcomings. Komsomol members not only can, but should point out various shortcomings to the Party and Soviet organs. Indifference to shortcomings and standing idly by are not qualities that a Komsomol member should have.

The new situation presents us with the task of further improving the level of the Komsomol's work and further improving the leadership work of the Komsomol Central Committee. Comrade Malenkov's criticism in his report of the shortcomings in cadre work is also directly related to the Komsomol. Some Komsomol leading cadres have embarked on the inglorious path of perfunctoriness, deception, and concealing shortcomings. Although these phenomena are individual phenomena, we cannot tolerate them.

In the Komsomol organizations of Novosibirsk and Ryazan, a phenomenon was exposed: some Komsomol cadres do not promote the development of criticism and self-criticism, but embark on the path of suppressing criticism. We must remove people with this anti-Party style of work from the Komsomol work they are responsible for. The Komsomol must fully promote and encourage criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. Only in this way can we consolidate the grassroots organizations of the Komsomol and improve the enthusiasm of the Komsomol members.

Comrades! The basis of the Komsomol's work achievements lies in the leadership of the Leninist-Stalinist Party. Just as organisms cannot survive without sunlight and air, the Komsomol cannot live without the leadership of the Leninist-Stalinist Communist Party. The Party's leading organs constantly give the Komsomol great help. However, we also sometimes find that some Party municipal committees, district committees, and state committees forget the responsibility of regularly leading the communist education work of the younger generation. There is also the phenomenon that it is not the Standing Committee of the Party's state committee or its first secretary who implements the Party's leadership over the Komsomol, but one of the secretaries who leads the Komsomol organization in the form of so-called guidance. What results this can cause can be seen from the example of the Irkutsk State Committee. Relying on the lack of work inspection, the Komsomol Irkutsk State Committee violated the Bolshevik principles of selecting cadres. People who do Komsomol work are sometimes decided by chance. Criticism and self-criticism are put on the shelf. The Party's state committee not only did not resolutely expose these shortcomings, but whitewashed the mistakes and adopted a liberal attitude. Only because of the help of the Central Committee of the CPSU did the Komsomol Central Committee and the Party's state committee correct these shortcomings.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and Comrade Stalin regularly guide the work of the Komsomol and give it tremendous and inestimable help. Nowhere is there as much concern for the youth as in our Soviet country. The Komsomol and all Soviet youth are warmly grateful to the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin for this concern and for the happiness and joy of our lives. (Applause)

The Party Central Committee studies all aspects of the life, work, and education of Soviet youth. By the opening of the Party's 18th Congress, there were eight million people in the Komsomol. Now, the Komsomol has nearly sixteen million members. During this period, more than four million Komsomol members joined the Communist Party. The ranks of the Leninist Young Pioneers have also expanded.

At the opening of the Party's 18th Congress, the Young Pioneers had nearly eleven million members. Now, the Young Pioneers have nearly nineteen million members. By the opening of the 19th Congress of the CPSU, the Komsomol has become a powerful force unprecedentedly united around the Party Central Committee, the great leader, and teacher Comrade Stalin. (Prolonged applause)

Comrades! For the entire army of young communist builders, there is nothing more sublime than fighting for the victory of communism under the invincible banner of Lenin and under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, and fighting for the great cause of Lenin and Stalin. (Applause)

Please allow me to assure our leader—the Communist Party, please allow me to assure the Congress and Comrade Stalin: Komsomol members and youth are ready to fight for communism and will always follow their dear Communist Party and follow Comrade Stalin. (Prolonged applause)

Any threats and adventures by imperialist aggressors cannot hinder the great cause of communist construction in our country. Any ambitions of the enemy will be shattered. The Soviet people and Soviet youth, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin, have well mastered Stalin's science of achieving victory. Let the reactionary gentlemen of America remember this.

The sun of communism shines on our motherland. The youth of the Soviet country feel that they have unlimited energy, full of creative joy and enthusiasm, full of confidence in the victory of communism; the great Leninist-Stalinist Party encourages and leads us to engage in struggle.

The Soviet youth, the Stalinist youth, eagerly hope to contribute all their strength, wisdom, and will to serve the motherland, the Communist Party, the cause of communism—the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.

Let us advance towards communism under the banner of Lenin and under the leadership of Comrade Stalin!

Long live our great leader and teacher, our dear Comrade Stalin! (Stormy and prolonged applause)

### 米哈依洛夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的发言

    米哈依洛夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的发言
    编者按：米哈依洛夫原是苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记，现在是苏联共产党中央委员会主席团和书记处的成员之一。本文是他在联共第十九次代表大会上的发言。原文载十月七日苏联“真理报”。下面是发言的译文。
    同志们！马林科夫同志的报告，描绘了一幅列宁—斯大林党为共产主义建设的胜利而斗争的鲜明的图画。苏联人民在共产党和斯大林同志的领导之下，获得了具有全世界历史意义的胜利。苏联青年，正如我们全体人民一样，带着应有的骄傲和极大的愉快来回顾我们祖国所走过的道路。各国的千百万劳动者和进步人们，也和我们一道分享着这种愉快。
    列宁—斯大林的青年团，努力在各方面都做到不辜负共产党的忠实助手和战斗后备军的称号。斯大林同志说：“青年团总是站在我们战士的最前列。我不知道青年团有落后于我们革命生活事件的情况。”无论在作战方面——如在伟大卫国战争时期，无论在劳动中——在和平建设时期，青年团一直是和党的步调一致的。在工厂和集体农庄里，在共产主义建设工程的工地里，在建造防护林带的工作中——无论在何处，年轻的共产主义建设者都在忘我地从事着劳动。许多优秀的先进工作者，从青年中涌现出来。
    党代表大会拟订了我国的共产主义建设计划。苏维埃社会的历史，全世界的人民生活，正在展开着新的一页。
    斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，从思想上武装了党和苏联人民，指出了从社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路。斯大林同志的这一著作，是一部天才的思想创作，它推进着整个社会的发展。
    青年团员和全体苏联青年认为，为胜利地实现斯大林同志关于共产主义建设的指示而忘我地斗争，是自己的光荣的事业。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    新的历史情况提出了新的任务。我们必须根据斯大林同志的指示来实现青年团各方面的工作，保证对青年的共产主义教育新高潮的出现。要做到这一点，就必须作很大的努力，克服许多困难，将战斗的革命英雄主义气魄与实事求是的精神结合起来。
    斯大林同志教导说，准备过渡到共产主义的先决条件之一，是使社会文化高度发展，以保证社会的一切成员都能全面发展他们的体力和智力。
    与这件事直接相关联的就是，联共中央委员会所制定的更进一步发展国民教育和综合技术教育的计划。苏联青年深切地了解；没有知识和科学，就无法胜利地建设新社会。我国的绝大部分青年，都在普通学校、技术学校、高等学校以及各种夜校和函授学校学习。大家都知道，我们的学校取得了多么巨大的成就。但是，在学校工作中，还是有缺点存在：留级生的数目还不少；有相当多的学生某些功课的成绩不及格；有些学校的教学—思想教育工作组织得不好；有些城市和地区的学校房舍不够用。这一切都不能不使党的、苏维埃的和青年团的机关感到不安。
    教师在学校中，是起着决定性的作用的。有相当数目的教师没有受过应有的教育。然而，提高师资水平的工作，函授教学的组织，教学研究会的活动，有时有很大的缺点。大家对苏联的教育科学要求很高，可是，这方面的工作，显然有落后于要求的情况，没有编撰得很好的教育学课本。研究和总结先进教师经验的工作，进行得也不好。教育科学研究院对许多重要问题没有给予解答，没有出版内容丰富的著作，对改编若干课本的事情，也做得不够好。党的和苏维埃的机关，必须对国民教育这一极端重要的事业尽应有的力量。
    遗憾得很，并不是所有的党的机关都在密切地研究着学校的各种问题。例如，联共中央曾提请吉尔吉斯共产党中央注意学校工作中所存在的重大缺点，但是，这些缺点改正得却很慢。这个共和国还有半文盲者，没有实行普遍义务教育计划，还有被淘汰的学生，特别是女学生，许多工农青年夜校的工作，也进行得不好。
    在这个共和国的共产党代表大会上，吉尔吉斯共产党中央委员会书记拉柴科夫同志本来应该承认：共和国党的和苏维埃的机关对国民教育的领导工作是作得不能令人满意的。这个批评大概会首先使吉尔吉斯共产党中央加强对学校和对教师的关切。
    从新任务看来，必须做到使教育青年、提高青年文化水平的问题，成为青年团所注意的中心问题。保证团员和少年先锋队员在学习中起先进作用；经常帮助学校校长、教师和级任导师进行教学工作；积极地参加推行普遍中等教育（十年制）和综合技术教育、培养新师资、加强学校教学物质设备的一切工作——就是我们的职责。
    青年团还应该更加积极地在高等学校里进行工作，帮助党从青年中培养新的熟练的高等专家。
    斯大林同志关于语言学和政治经济学的各著作，一再指明了先进革命科学的伟大力量。青年团应该做到使任何一个知识部门的青年专家，都不倦地学会掌握列宁和斯大林的学说。使学习革命科学成为青年的日常生活需要。
    每一个社会时代，都产生了本时代的英雄人物。社会主义时代，也产生了各种英雄。我们时代的英雄，就是全心全意忠诚于列宁—斯大林事业的苏维埃爱国者，积极的共产主义的建设者。苏联青年正在被发展和培养成全面的、各方面谐调的人。具有崇高的道德品质，为人民的福利而不倦地劳动，不倦地渴求文化、科学和各种知识，经常从事体育运动、积极参加社会活动—这就是我们时代年轻的苏维埃人的特点。
    但是，我们不能不也注意到另外一些事实，它们证明敌对阶级的影响企图沾染青年。人们意识中的旧残余，还在显露出来。有些工厂里还有青年工人破坏劳动纪律的事件发生。无论在城市或乡村的青年中，还有懒汉，还有破坏社会主义公共生活规律的人。还有一些男女青年受着宗教的影响。
    团中央对青年思想教育工作的领导，是有严重的缺点的。教育工作进行得往往内容贫乏，形式主义，使青年觉得索然无味。许多团组织的这一工作是极端废弛的。对青年进行共产主义教育，一直总是青年团的主要任务。现在，在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期，教育工作的意义更加增大了。青年团要遵照党代表大会和斯大林同志的指示，全力改进对青年群众的思想教育工作，用共产主义的精神来培养年轻一代。我们必须坚决地清除思想教育工作中的缺点，把这一工作提高到新任务所要求的水平。无疑地，党组织在这方面将会全力协助青年团的。
    马林科夫同志在报告中，也很多地提到了文学和艺术。苏联青年喜爱和珍视卓越的苏联文学和艺术这种为共产主义而斗争的重要武器。
    近几年来，产生了很多优秀作品，这是我们人民的骄傲。这些作品对于培养青年的共产主义思想起着重大的作用，但是有些文学家还在发表粗糙的、无思想性的作品。他们落后于现实，他们的创作中忽略了青年们劳动、学习、生活的许多重要方面。
    苏联戏剧界所创作的描写我们社会主义生活的好作品，也是不多的。去年所发表的剧本，仅仅只有两种获得了斯大林奖金，这就有力地说明了剧作界的情形不佳。但剧作界的使命却是要协助对年轻一代进行教育。苏联作家协会理事会和苏联部长会议艺术委员会，举行过几十次大小会议，讨论苏联剧作界落后的原因。关于这一问题，也发表过大量文章。但是，有时人们有这样的印象：有些剧作家根本停止写剧本了，而主要在写文章说明为什么没有关于苏联生活的剧本创作出来（全场哄笑）。
    青年们常常提出一些很公正的批评意见，说苏联电影部的工作有严重的缺点，该部创作的描写苏联现实生活的好影片不多。苏联电影事业部和苏联作家协会的领导者们，不仅承认这些缺点，并且也在不断地讨论怎样改正这种情况的问题。同时，电影事业部抱怨苏联作家协会理事会，说好电影脚本不够。而苏联作家协会理事会则批评电影事业部。双方争吵不休，而好影片却创作得很少。
    党教导我们说，仅仅承认缺点还不够，还应该学会改正缺点。现在是电影事业部、苏联作家协会理事会、艺术委员会用实际行动回答批评的时候了。这样，会对青年共产主义教育事业带来许多好处。青年将以极尊重和感激的心情来接受苏联文学、艺术和电影的优秀新作品。
    党教导青年团要把自己学习、教育的每一步骤，都与建设新社会的实际任务结合起来。青年团将要更积极地在青年中展开社会主义竞赛，来响应党代表大会的决议。各工业部门的团员和青年，都将要努力增加生产，提高劳动生产率，减低产品成本，改进产品质量。农村的团员和青年，将要努力提高各种作物的收获率，更进一步发展公共养畜业，改进集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站的工作。
    应该说，青年模范工作者的有益的创议，并不是经常得到必要的支持的。例如：斯大林奖金获得者、青年工人济可夫、契基列夫等同志，在工程师和技术员的积极帮助下使金属切削速度大大提高，高速切削法发挥了车床极大潜在能力。但是，有些政府部门，例如苏联农业机器制造部，并没有真正支持这一事业。该部年复一年地完成不了推行高速切削法的计划。现在看起来，该部的工作者好像已决定根本地不作这种计划了。他们错误地以为，这样将可以更安心地过日子。
    马林科夫同志谈到了节约地使用资源的问题，斯大林汽车工厂，根据青年们的创议，采用了各种有益的措施，在今年上半年，节约了将近三千吨的金属。不难想像，如果全国都更节约地使用金属，将会节省多么巨大数量的金属。使用金属超过定额，切削得不节约，丢弃部分很大，这一切在许多工厂都是很普遍的现象。应该对浪费宣布坚决的斗争，把节约的口号坚决贯彻到生活中去。
    党和斯大林同志不断地教导我们不要与缺点妥协。如果一个青年团员发现了缺点，那么，他就该努力使这缺点消除。如果团组织知道了，例如说，某集体农庄的工作中有粗枝大叶的毛病，有违反农业劳动组合章程的情况—很遗憾，这种现象很多—，那它就应该努力使这些缺点消除。青年团员不仅可以，而且应该向党的和苏维埃的机关指出各种缺点。对缺点漠不关心，袖手旁观，不是一个青年团员应有的品质。
    新情况对我们提出了更进一步提高团的工作水平的任务，更进一步改进团中央领导工作的任务。马林科夫同志在报告中对干部工作的缺点所提出的批评，也是与青年团有直接关系的。有些团的领导干部，走上了敷衍、欺骗、掩饰缺点的不光荣的道路。虽然这些现象是个别现象，但我们也不能容忍。
    在新西伯利亚城和梁赞城的团组织，被揭发过一种现象：有一些团干部不推动批评和自我批评的展开，而走上压制批评的道路。有这种反党作风的人，我们必须撤销他所担负的团的工作。青年团必须全力发扬和鼓励批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。只有这样，才能巩固团的基层组织，提高团员的积极性。
    同志们！青年团工作成绩的基础，在于列宁—斯大林党的领导。正像生物没有阳光和空气就不能生存一样，青年团没有列宁—斯大林共产党的领导就不能生活。党的领导机关经常不断地给青年团极大的帮助。但是，我们也有时发现，党的有些市委、区委、州委忘记了应该经常领导年青一代共产主义教育工作的责任。还有这样的现象，不是党的州委常委会、它的第一书记来实现党对青年团的领导，而是书记中的一个人，以所谓辅导的方式来领导团组织。这会造成什么结果，可以从伊尔库茨克州委的例子中看出来。青年团伊尔库茨克州委倚仗着没有工作检查，而违反了选用干部的布尔什维克原则。做青年团工作的人，有时是偶然决定的。批评和自我批评被置之高阁。党的州委不仅没有坚决地揭发这些缺点，反而粉饰过错，采取自由主义态度。只是因为有联共中央的帮助，团中央和党的州委才使这种缺点得到改正。
    联共中央和斯大林同志经常指导团的工作，并给它极大的不可估计的帮助。在任何地方，都没有像在我们苏维埃国家里对青年这样关心。青年团和全体苏联青年为这种关心，为我们生活的幸福和愉快而热烈地感谢共产党和斯大林同志。（鼓掌）
    党中央研究着苏联青年的生活、工作、教育各方面的问题。截至党第十八次代表大会开幕时，青年团内有八百万人。现在，青年团有将近一千六百万团员。在这一段期间内，有四百万以上的团员加入了共产党的队伍。列宁少年先锋队的队伍也扩大了。
    在党的第十八次代表大会开幕时，少年先锋队有将近一千一百万队员。现在，少年先锋队有将近一千九百万队员。到第十九次联共党代表大会开幕时，青年团已成为一支在党中央、伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志周围空前团结的强大队伍了。（经久不息的掌声）
    同志们！对整个年轻的共产主义建设者大军来说，没有什么比在不可战胜的列宁旗帜下，在斯大林同志领导下，为共产主义胜利而战斗、为列宁—斯大林的伟大事业而战斗更崇高的了。（鼓掌）
    请允许向我们的领导者——共产党保证，请允许向代表大会，向斯大林同志保证：青年团员和青年准备着为共产主义而斗争，并永远跟着自己亲爱的共产党，跟着斯大林同志走。（经久不息的掌声）
    帝国主义侵略者的任何威胁和冒险行为，都不能妨碍我国共产主义建设的伟大事业。敌人的任何野心，都将被粉碎。苏联人民和苏联青年，在共产党和斯大林同志的领导下，很好地掌握了斯大林的取得胜利的科学。让美国的反动派先生们记住这一点。
    共产主义的太阳照耀着我们的祖国。苏维埃国家的青年感觉自己有无限的精力，充满了创造的快慰与热情，充满了对共产主义胜利的信心；有伟大的列宁—斯大林党鼓舞着和带领着我们从事斗争。
    苏联青年，斯大林的青年，热望着把自己的一切力量、智慧和意志贡献出来，为祖国、为共产党、共产主义事业——列宁—斯大林的伟大事业而服务。
    让我们在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林同志的领导下向共产主义前进！
    我们伟大的领袖和导师、亲爱的斯大林同志万岁！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
