    Heroic Volunteer Army Air Force Squadron Leader Wang Hai
    Xu Zhaoqun
    Early in the morning, in the ground command post of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army Air Force, everyone was quietly listening to the news of aerial combat transmitted from the radio.
    Time passed second by second, and suddenly the radio crackled with the sound of "We are about to return." At this moment, the ground crew busied themselves, and everyone walked towards the taxiway to welcome the triumphant "eagles." The commander standing beside me smiled and patted my shoulder, saying, "The Wang Hai you want to interview is about to come down from the sky."
    In just a minute, pairs of "eagles" flying from the distant sky like rockets smoothly landed at the base with a gust of rushing air. The commander pointed to the "eagle" that landed first, with five red stars – emblems of battle merit – painted on its fuselage, and said to me, "That's the jet fighter piloted by Squadron Leader Wang Hai. As early as this spring, he shot down four enemy planes and damaged one." At this moment, Wang Hai had already jumped out of the cockpit and ran over to report the air combat details to the commander with the imposing demeanor unique to pilots. The morning sun shone on the airfield, and the military medals and the Commemorative Medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea on his chest sparkled.
    Following the commander's order, Wang Hai used chalk to draw an arrow on the blackboard with a map of the Korean war zone and said, "Following the orders of the ground superiors, we flew directly into the war zone after taking off. At that time, there was fog in the air, and we could barely see two thousand meters ahead. We passed through layer after layer of clouds. I immediately remembered what the superiors had said: In the air, we must make an effort to discover the enemy first in order to subdue them. So I ordered the wingman to search separately above and below the clouds. As soon as the wingman and I emerged from the clouds, we immediately saw eight black dots flying west close to the cloud layer. The timing didn't allow me to hesitate, and I immediately issued the order to attack the enemy planes."
    "Yes, the decision was correct," the commander praised. "But how did you attack the enemy planes?"
    "Just as I was chasing up to open fire, the cunning fellows immediately scattered and circled in the air. So I raised my head and suddenly dove into the clouds above. The enemy thought I was gone, so they re-formed their formation and flew forward close to the cloud layer. At this time, I accurately calculated the time, speed, and distance in the clouds, selected the attack position, and suddenly dove down through the clouds, tightly biting the lead plane of the enemy, and fired a few cannons fiercely. A ball of fire wrapped the enemy plane, and it fell from the high sky."
    I listened with reverence to Wang Hai's report of the cloud combat. After the commander introduced me, Wang Hai knew that I was from the motherland, and he shook my hand vigorously and said, "What are the people of the motherland expecting from us?" I was momentarily stunned by his enthusiastic question, and I only answered, "Everyone hopes you will be victorious!" At this time, staff officers, political workers, ground crew... all ran over and surrounded this rosy-cheeked, energetic airman.

    "Wang Hai became a heroic airman under the long-term education of the Party. You can observe his spirit of decisiveness and alertness in every action of this young man!" The commander said to me with fondness.
    The commander's introduction made me want to interview Wang Hai further. From the interview, I recorded his heroic deeds in another air combat. This time, Wang Hai led his comrades Jiao Jingwen, Ma Baotang, and Liu Delin in a battle that defeated an enemy four times their number.
    That day at dawn, the squadron received the order to prepare for battle, and Wang Hai and his comrades immediately jumped into the cockpit.
    At 7:30, the green signal flares of departure rose into the clear morning sky. "We are confident that we can withstand the test of air combat, and we are determined to establish meritorious service in the battle to strike down American aerial bandits!" Wang Hai, Jiao Jingwen, Ma Baotang, and Liu Delin ascended into the high sky with such heroic sentiments.
    The sun rose in the east, and the aircraft formation advanced towards the south in a majestic formation. On this morning, the thousands upon thousands of comrades fighting on the Korean transportation lines should be resting after a night of hard work; on this morning, the ranks of workers and peasants on the motherland's production front are heading towards factories and fields to begin their labor, and the children wearing red scarves are also about to go to their beloved schools. Squadron Leader Wang Hai thought of these things, and his heart couldn't help but pound. He searched for the enemy in all directions without relaxing for a second. But the sky was boundless! He had been flying for a long time and still hadn't found the enemy.
    At this time, the voice of the ground commander came from the radio: "Pay attention to searching, there are enemy planes operating directly in front of you!" So the four "eagles" flew quickly south, one in front of the other, one on the left and one on the right. Wang Hai issued an order while flying: "The Qingchuan River is ahead, pay attention to searching!" Before he finished speaking, wingman Jiao Jingwen reported to him: "Smoke is rising from the south end of that bridge!" Wang Hai tilted the plane and took a look, and hatred immediately surged into his heart: This must be American planes coming to bomb it, chase them! We must not let this group of murderous bandits escape in vain! Wang Hai dove down from the high sky, passed through the smoke columns erected on the bridgehead, and encountered the aerial enemies – four American planes.
    An allied aircraft taking off from another base was bravely fighting with these four American planes. Wang Hai abided by the Air Force's saying that "assisting a comrade on the battlefield is more important than shooting down an enemy plane" and immediately joined the battle. At this time, Ma Baotang, who had single-handedly fought twelve American Sabre jet fighters half a month ago, quickly led his wingman Liu Delin to ascend into the high sky to cover Wang Hai and the allied aircraft in attacking the enemy planes.
    But as Wang Hai bravely rushed towards the enemy planes, eight more enemy planes suddenly flew in stealthily from the west coast. Hero Wang Hai ordered Ma Baotang to lead his wingman to attack the eight enemy planes while still rushing towards the original four enemy planes. This sudden attack frightened the four enemy planes, and they turned their heads and fled south.
    At this time, suddenly the radio transmitted a report from wingman Jiao Jingwen, saying that four more enemy planes were about to attack Wang Hai from behind. Wang Hai immediately turned the plane, avoided the enemy planes' shooting, ascended into the high sky in one go, and then immediately rushed down and fiercely fired at the lead plane of the enemy planes that were attacking him from behind.
    The lead plane was hit and its fuselage began to shake. Wang Hai added a few more cannon shots, and the enemy plane instantly turned into a ball of black smoke and fell from the sky. At this time, wingman Jiao Jingwen bravely chased up to the enemy's wingman and, with a burst of fire, also shot down the enemy's wingman from the sky.
    At this time, the other two enemy planes were panicked, and they desperately drilled into the low sky. Wang Hai cursed in his heart: "Shameless fellows, where do you think you can escape to!" He wiped the sweat from his forehead and chased down with his wingman through layers of thin clouds. Getting closer, he accurately locked the enemy plane into the sight and then fired a burst of shells. One enemy plane was hit by the shells and fell towards the mountains. At this time, Ma Baotang and Liu Delin also reported to him on the radio that they had shot down an enemy plane.
    An air combat ended victoriously. Wang Hai led his comrades to destroy six enemy planes in more than ten minutes.

    After returning to the motherland, on November 23, I received a letter from Air Force Squadron Leader Wang Hai from the Korean front. In his letter, he told me, "...We are always thinking of the people of the motherland, and every time we think of them, our courage and confidence are even more enhanced. On November 17, we achieved another victory in the battle over the south bank of the Qingchuan River. I believe this is the prelude to the victory of the winter air war. I know that the battle situation requires us to more actively learn combat skills and the art of command in air combat, and strive to shoot down more American aerial bandits!"

    英雄的志愿军空军大队长王海
    许钊群
    早晨，在志愿军空军某部的地面指挥所里，每个人都在静悄悄地倾听着从无线电里传来的空中战斗的消息。
    时间一秒一秒地过去，无线电忽然响起“我们就要返航了”的声音。这时，地勤人员们便忙碌起来，大家走向滑行道上去迎接凯旋归来的“雄鹰”。站在我旁边的指挥员微笑着，拍拍我的肩膀说：“你要访问的王海就要从天上下来了。”
    只不过过了一分钟，一对对从远空像火箭一样飞来的“雄鹰”，带着一股冲人的气浪平稳地降落到基地上了。指挥员指着那架首先着陆的、机身上染有五个红星——战功徽的“雄鹰”，对我说：“那就是大队长王海驾驶的喷气机。还在今年春天，他就打落了四架敌机，打伤了一架敌机。”这时，王海已经跳下座舱，带着飞行员素有的威武的姿态跑过来向指挥员报告空战经过。早晨的太阳照耀着机场，他胸前的军功章和抗美援朝纪念章在闪闪发光。
    按着指挥员的命令，王海用粉笔在画有朝鲜战区地图的黑板上划了一个箭头说：“遵照地面首长的命令，起飞后我们便直插战区。当时空中有云雾，向前最多看不到两千公尺，穿过这层云又进入那层云。我马上想起了首长讲过的话：在空中一定要下功夫去先发现敌人，才能够制服敌人。于是我命令僚机在云上云下分头搜索。我和僚机刚钻出云来，一眼就望见八个黑点贴着云层向西飞行，时机不允许我犹豫，我立即下达了向敌机攻击的命令。”
    “是的，决心下的很对。”指挥员夸奖地说。“但是你们怎样向敌机攻击的呢？”
    “正当我追上去要开炮的时候，狡猾的家伙马上分散了，在空中兜起圈子来了。于是我仰起头来，一下子就钻到上面的云里。敌人以为我走了，就又编起队来贴着云层向前飞行。这时我在云上精确地计算着时间、速度和距离，把攻击位置选择好，就猛然地透过云层俯冲下去，紧紧地咬住敌人带队的那架飞机，狠狠地放了几炮。一团烈火卷着敌机，从高空中掉下去了。”
    我怀着崇敬的心情听完王海云中战斗的报告。经过指挥员介绍，王海知道我是从祖国来的以后，就使劲地握住我的手说：“祖国人民都在盼望我们什么呢？”我一时被他的热情的问话怔住了，我只回答这么一句：“大家都希望你们胜利！”这时，参谋人员、政治工作人员、地勤人员……都跑过来围住了这个脸色紫红、精神饱满的空中战士。
    ×××
    “王海是在党的长期教养下成为一个英勇的空中战士的。你从这小伙子的每一个行动上都可以观察到他那股果敢、机警的劲头！”指挥员同志怀着偏爱的心情对我说。
    指挥员的介绍使我产生了进一步访问王海的心意。我从访问中记下了他在另外一次空战中的英勇事迹。这一次是王海率领着焦景文、马保堂、刘德林三位战友打胜多于他们四倍的敌人的一场战斗。
    那天拂晓，大队接到了准备战斗的命令，王海和他的战友立即跳进了座舱。
    七时三十分，出征的绿色信号弹升上了清晨的天空。“我们有信心经得起空战的考验，我们有决心在打击美国空中强盗的战斗中建立功勋！”王海、焦景文、马保堂、刘德林怀着这样的英雄的心情升上高空。
    东方升起了太阳，机群摆着威武的队形向着南方挺进。在这个早晨，战斗在朝鲜运输线上的千千万万的战友们经过整夜的忙碌该是休息的时候了；在这个早晨，祖国生产战线上的工人和农民的队伍正在走向工厂和田野开始劳动了，围着红领巾的小朋友们也快要走向心爱的学校了。大队长王海想到这些，心头不由得跳动起来，他每秒钟都不放松地向着四面八方搜索敌人。但天空是一眼望不到边的啊！飞了好久了，还没有找到敌人。
    这时，无线电里传来了地面指挥员的声音：“注意搜索，在你们的正前方有敌机活动！”于是四只“雄鹰”就一前一后，一左一右地向南疾飞。王海一边飞一边发出命令：“前面是清川江，注意搜索！”他的话才说完，僚机焦景文就向他报告：“那座桥南头冒烟啦！”王海侧过飞机一看，仇恨立即涌上心头：这一定是美国飞机来轰炸了，追呀！决不能让这群杀人强盗白白地逃掉！王海从高空俯冲下来，穿过桥头上矗立着的烟柱，碰上了空中仇敌——四架美国飞机。
    从另一基地出发的一架友机，正在英勇地和这四架美国飞机进行战斗。王海遵守着“战场上援助一个战友比打掉一架敌机还要紧”这句空军的格言，立即投入战斗。这时，在半月前曾单独和十二架美国佩刀式喷气机格斗过的马保堂就迅速地领着僚机刘德林升上高空，掩护王海和友机去攻击敌机。
    但是当王海勇猛地扑向敌机的时候，突然从西海岸上偷偷地又飞来了八架敌机。英雄王海一边命令马保堂率领僚机向八架敌机进行攻击，一边仍向着原先那四架敌机扑去。这突然的袭击，吓得四架敌机扭头就向着南方逃去。
    这时，忽然无线电传来僚机焦景文的报告，说后面又有四架敌机很快就要向王海攻击了。王海马上调转机头，避开后面敌机的射击，一下升入高空，然后马上急冲下来，猛烈射击从后面偷袭他的敌机的领队长机。
    那架领队长机被打得机身摇动起来。王海又“统”
    “统”的加上几炮，这架敌机瞬间化为一团黑烟，从天空中掉下去了。在这时候，僚机焦景文勇猛地追上了敌人的僚机，一阵炮火，也把敌人的僚机从空中打落下去了。
    这时，另外两架敌机被打得慌了手脚，它们拚命地往低空钻去。王海心中骂道：“无耻的家伙，你们想逃到那里去呀！”他挥去额上的汗珠，带着僚机穿过层层薄云紧追下去。接近了，他准确地将敌机套进瞄准镜，接着就是一排炮弹。有架敌机吃到了炮弹，向着山野掉了下去。这时，马保堂和刘德林也在无线电中向他报告了击落敌机的消息。
    一场空战胜利结束。王海率领他的战友在十几分钟内击毁了六架敌机。
    ×××
    我回到祖国以后，十一月二十三日接到空军大队长王海从朝鲜前线寄给我的信。他在信里告诉我说：“……我们时刻怀念着祖国的人们，每想到他们，我们的勇气、信心就更加增强了。在十一月十七日，我们又在清川江南岸上空的战斗中取得了胜利，我认为这是冬季空战胜利的序幕。我知道，战斗形势要求我们更加积极地学习战斗本领和空战中的指挥艺术，争取打下更多的美国空中强盗！”（新华社）（附图片）
