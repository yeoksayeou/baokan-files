Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 30th: On the snowy and frigid Korean front, invading American soldiers spent their third Christmas in bleakness since the disastrous 1950 "Christmas Offensive." These people, driven by the American government to the distant Korean Peninsula to carry out a war of aggression, could not only not reunite with their families during this holiday, but also could not even get a rest. They continued to cut trees and build fortifications as usual on the front lines, and increased the number of patrols. However, the Korean-Chinese People's forces sent a large number of gifts to the American soldiers, and notified the American soldiers of a three-hour ceasefire on certain battle lines, so that they could have a chance to spend Christmas peacefully.

On Christmas Day, the Korean-Chinese People's forces on the front lines used various methods to make American soldiers understand more clearly that the reason why they could not go home to celebrate the festival was that American billionaires insisted on the war of aggression; and to make them understand our army's humanitarian policy of treating prisoners kindly, and to point out a way to preserve their lives. The Korean-Chinese People's Army set up many slogans, cartoons and battlefield mailboxes on the battle lines, hung "Christmas bags" full on the branches and barbed wire in front of the enemy, and placed Christmas cards, paper Santa Clauses, commemorative badges engraved with peace doves, as well as apples, candies and other gifts on the snow. Among the gifts was a commemorative album, with a calendar and quotations from famous people in ancient and modern times printed on it, one page of which wrote a proverb: "You can lead a cow to the river, but you can't force a cow to drink." On the reverse side was a popular saying among American soldiers: "Money can make me a soldier, but it can't make me fight."

On the Kimhwa front, our army placed many gift boxes on "Little Green Mountain" southwest of Mount Wu-sheng at night. The next morning, an American sentry discovered these boxes, and he moved them back and forth several times by himself. Then the American soldiers in the bunker all rushed out and grabbed all the gifts. In the days before Christmas, our frontline broadcasters began to speak to the enemy and broadcast songs. One night, soldiers of the American 40th Division east of Munsan-ni were building fortifications. After our army's broadcasting began, the sound of cutting trees and pickaxes hitting frozen earth stopped. Our army's broadcaster said: "American soldiers, 'Christmas' is here, maybe you have received gifts from home, but 'Santa Claus' has not brought you peace. Your generals do not release prisoners of war in accordance with the 'Geneva Convention', and your government manipulated the UN General Assembly to pass illegal resolutions, determined to continue and expand the war. This makes it impossible for you to go home for Christmas, and you will continue to suffer casualties and bloodshed. The proposal of ceasefire first and then negotiation on the repatriation of prisoners, which the Chinese and Korean people firmly advocate, is the only way to reasonably resolve the Korean issue, and the only way for you to avoid meaningless sacrifices. Ask your government to abandon its sinful war policy!" The broadcast stopped, and although the sound of cutting trees sounded again, it could be heard that it was more slow and weak.

On the 24th—Christmas Eve, our army on the central front knocked out Christmas bells for the American soldiers with artillery shells on the positions, and scattered colorful fireworks in the night sky. Many American soldiers poked their heads out of the bunkers to watch. On the 25th—Christmas Day, our army on Western Mountain used the radio to notify the U.S. military of a three-hour "ceasefire," so that the American soldiers who could not raise their heads from the cold shots and cold cannons could get out of the bunkers to breathe fresh air. But when our army notified the "ceasefire", the American officers ordered the American artillery to fire eight shells at our army's positions. Our army immediately returned fire with one hundred and thirty shells. Later, our army broadcasters warned the American officers, "If you fire the artillery again, the American officers will be responsible for the casualties of the American army during these three hours!" As a result, the enemy officers dared not order the artillery to fire any more shells, and the American soldiers happily came out to walk around.

    朝中部队赠美军士兵圣诞礼物
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】在风雪寒冷的朝鲜前线，侵朝美军士兵在凄凉中度过了一九五零年“圣诞节攻势”惨败以来的第三个圣诞节。这些被美国政府驱使到遥远的朝鲜半岛来进行侵略战争的人们，在这个节日不仅不能和家人团聚，而且连休息都得不到。他们在前沿阵地上照常地砍树、修工事，并且增多了巡逻的差事。而朝中人民部队却送给美国士兵大批礼物，并在某些战线上给美国士兵停火三小时的通知，使他们能够有一个安度圣诞节的机会。
    在圣诞节那天，前线朝中人民部队用各种办法使美国士兵们更清楚地了解不能回家欢度节日的原因是美国亿万富翁们坚持侵略战争；并使他们了解我军宽待俘虏的人道主义政策，给他们指出保全生命的道路。朝中人民军队在战线上布置了许多标语、漫画和战地信箱，把“圣诞袋”挂满在敌人前沿的树枝和铁丝网上，把圣诞画片、纸做的圣诞老人、刻着和平鸽的纪念章以及苹果、糖果等礼物摆在雪地上。礼物中有一本纪念册，上面印着日历和古今名人格言，其中有一页上写着一句谚语：“你可以把牛牵到河里，但是不能强迫牛喝水。”它的反面写着一句美军士兵中的流行语：“钱可以使我当兵，但不能使我打仗。”
    在金化前线，我军夜里在五圣山西南的“小青山”上放了许多礼物箱。第二天早上，一个美国哨兵发现了这些箱子，他一个人来回搬了好几次，接着地堡里的美国兵都一齐拥出来把这些礼物抢了个光。在圣诞节前几天，我军火线播音员就开始向敌人讲话，播送歌曲。一天夜里，文登里以东美军四十师的士兵正在修筑工事，当我军播音机开始播音后，砍伐树木和铁镐碰着冰土的声音就停止了。我军播音员说：“美国士兵们，‘圣诞节’到了，也许你们收到了家里送来的礼物，但是，‘圣诞老人’并没有给你们带来和平。你们的将军们不按‘日内瓦公约’释放战俘，你们的政府操纵联合国大会通过了非法的决议案，决心继续和扩大战争。这就使得你们不能回家过圣诞节，而且将继续遭到死伤、流血。中朝人民坚决主张的先停火再谈判遣俘问题的建议是合理解决朝鲜问题的唯一办法，是你们避免没有意义的牺牲的唯一道路，你们要求你们的政府放弃罪恶的战争政策吧！”播音停止了，砍伐树木的声音虽然又响了起来，但是，可以听得出它已更加缓慢无力了。
    二十四日——圣诞之夜，中部前线我军在阵地上用炮弹壳为美国士兵敲起了圣诞钟声，并在夜空里散放着彩色缤纷的焰火，许多美国士兵都从地堡里伸出头来看。二十五日——圣诞节，西方山我军用播音机通知美军“停火”三小时、让被冷枪冷炮打得抬不起头来的美国兵能钻出地堡来痛快地呼吸呼吸新鲜空气。但在我军通知“停火”时，美国军官却命令美军炮兵向我军阵地打了八发炮弹，我军马上向敌人还击了一百三十发炮弹，以后我军播音员们警告美国军官说：“如果再打炮，美军在这三小时内的死伤由美国军官自己负责！”于是，敌人军官就再不敢命令炮兵打炮了，美军士兵便高兴地出来走动了。
