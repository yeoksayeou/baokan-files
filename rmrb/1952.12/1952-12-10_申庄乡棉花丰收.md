Shenzhuang Township's Cotton Harvest

To the Editor: In the mere three years since the founding of the New China, we have already rebuilt our devastated homeland. If it weren't for the red silt on the roads as proof, you would surely ask in surprise when you arrive in our township (Shenzhuang Township, Weishi County, Henan Province): "Is this the Yellow River flooded area?" We wouldn't be surprised by your amazement, because the green willows surrounding the new villages, the boundless soybean fields, and the patches of cotton fields bursting with white floss hide the traces of disaster. This is the result of the Communist Party and the People's Government leading us to develop production.

This year, all ten villages in our township, with more than 870 mu of cotton fields, have had a bumper harvest. The estimated average yield is 80 to 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 40 to 50 percent compared to last year.

We were able to achieve such a bumper harvest mainly because the government helped us solve the difficulties of farm tools and fertilizers. During the drought resistance campaign, the government lent our township 19 waterwheels and led us to restore 80 wells that had been silted up and dig 3 new wells, so that the cotton fields were irrigated. This year, aphids occurred in the cotton fields three times, but they were all eliminated with the sprayers and cotton oil soap lent to us by the government. We also borrowed a lot of fertilizer powder, bean cakes, and sesame cakes as fertilizer. Shenzhuang Village alone borrowed 1.5 million yuan (RMB).

Although we have had a bumper harvest, we are still far behind the cotton yields in advanced production areas. Our cotton planting technology still needs to be improved. We are not accustomed to dense planting here. Generally, we keep about 1,000 seedlings per mu. This year, some people accepted the advanced experience of dense planting and kept 1,700 to 1,800 seedlings. It is estimated that their yield can reach 450 to 500 jin of seed cotton. In fact, our land is fertile, and we can keep more seedlings and increase production. Now everyone understands this principle. In the past, our cotton fields were dry land, but this year we have irrigation equipment, and next year we can convert most of the cotton fields into irrigated land, which can also increase production.

The bumper cotton harvest has significantly improved our lives. We are no longer worried about food and clothing, but hope that the government will supply more market cloth and daily necessities, to make our lives more convenient and dress our children more beautifully.

    申庄乡棉花丰收
    编辑同志：在新中国仅仅成立的三年多的日子里，我们已经把一片荒芜的家园重建起来了。如果不是大路上的红淤土作证的话，你走到我们乡（河南尉氏县申庄乡），一定会惊讶地问：“这就是黄泛区吗？”我们不会奇怪你的惊讶，因为青枝绿叶的杨柳围绕着新村，一望没边没沿的黄豆和一块块吐出白絮的棉田，使你看不到灾难的痕迹。这是共产党和人民政府领导我们发展生产的结果。
    今年我们全乡十个村，八百七十多亩棉田全部丰收，估计每亩平均产量达八十斤到一百斤皮棉，比去年提高四、五成。
    我们能够获得这样的丰收，主要是政府帮助我们解决了农具、肥料的困难。在抗旱运动中，政府贷放给我们乡水车十九部，领导我们恢复了被淤没的水井八十眼、开新井三眼，使棉田得到了灌溉。棉田今年普遍发生过三次蚜虫，也都用政府贷给我们的喷雾器和棉油皂把它消灭了。我们还贷到不少肥田粉、豆饼、芝麻饼作肥料，单我们申庄一个村就合一百五十万元人民币。
    我们虽然得到丰收，但比起先进生产地区棉花产量还相差很远。我们的植棉技术还需改进和提高。我们这里还不习惯密植，一般是每亩地留苗一千棵左右。今年有的人接受了密植这一先进经验，留了一千七、八百棵，估计他们的产量能收四百五十到五百斤籽棉。其实，我们的土地是肥沃的，还可以多留苗、多增产。现在大家也懂得这个道理了。过去我们的棉田是旱地，今年有了灌溉设备，明年就可以把大部棉田改为水浇地，这也能提高生产。
    棉花的丰收，显著地提高了我们的生活。我们现在已经不是愁吃愁穿，而是希望政府供给更多的市布和日用品。使我们生活更方便，孩子们打扮的更漂亮。　蔡云　申文中　赵合聚
