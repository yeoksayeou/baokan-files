    We Recognized the Importance of Basic Construction
    Cui Yingguo, Secretary of the Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    The basic construction work of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant began as early as 1950. However, from the perspective of the Party Committee's leadership ideology, truly placing basic construction in a primary position has only happened in the past month.
    Since the establishment of the Basic Construction Department in 1950, the long-standing problem we couldn't solve was the weakness of the organization and the lack of cadres. At the end of 1951, the entire department had less than 100 employees, with only six Party members among them. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, although more than a dozen technicians were transferred and dozens of skilled workers were recruited, the lack of experienced cadres as leadership backbone, especially the absence of a core of Party leadership in basic construction, resulted in insufficient design capacity, low work efficiency, and internal disorganization. The Basic Construction Department lacked complete financial, engineering, design, and construction systems. Sometimes, a project didn't even have the most basic material budget. Some engineers said, "Let's do it first, and review the mistakes later!" This led to many instances of rework and waste. This year, our plant had a total of ten basic construction tasks, but only six were completed. The main reason was the inadequate design work. For example, when repairing the pig iron casting machine, our engineers only copied a repair plan from someone else without thoroughly studying and analyzing the specific problems of the machine. As a result, a lot of money was spent, and after more than a year of repairs, the machine couldn't function effectively. The Party organization didn't take active measures to solve these problems in a timely manner. After July this year, although the leadership sent a deputy director, two Party affairs cadres, and some technical workers to work in the Basic Construction Department, the Party and government leaders within the plant didn't fully recognize the importance of basic construction and were unwilling to transfer more cadres to the basic construction department. As a result, this very important and very weak organization couldn't be strengthened quickly. In September and October this year, the Party Committee held two meetings to study the issue of allocating cadres to the Basic Construction Department. It was decided to transfer six technicians, but only four were actually transferred, and two were "borrowed." Originally, it was proposed to first transfer two section-chief-level experienced cadres to the Basic Construction Department, but not even one was transferred.
    In mid-November, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government convened a national conference of factory and mine directors, and the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "Put Basic Construction in a Primary Position." This sounded a loud alarm for us. We spent three days mobilizing all Communist Party members, administrative staff, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres in the plant and organized study and discussion. By this time, the plant's leading cadres had clarified two issues ideologically:
    First, the issue of putting basic construction in a primary position is the issue of national industrialization. Before this, many comrades, including our leading cadres, limited basic construction to small-scale repairs, and rarely considered the construction of more and larger factories and mines. Even if some comrades occasionally thought of this issue, they considered it "the business of the higher-ups." As a result, many working cadres were only satisfied with pursuing the completion of current production figures and lacked a clear vision of how to create conditions for larger-scale production tomorrow. This naturally formed a phenomenon of insufficient attention to basic construction from top to bottom. After this study and discussion, many comrades reflected, "We must draw cadres from the production side to establish the basic construction organization." In the face of new, more complex, and more arduous tasks, it is only possible to catch up with the needs of national construction by actively cultivating and promoting factory management cadres and technical personnel, and continuously developing and strengthening our own forces.
    Secondly, to do a good job in basic construction and create conditions for national industrialization, we must first give full play to our existing strength. In the past, many of our leading cadres had conservative and dependent ideas on the issue of fully utilizing existing strength. We waited for higher authorities to solve the problem of transferring cadres and were unwilling to transfer them from production departments. We only wanted ready-made technicians and didn't focus on training them. But now, the leadership from the plant headquarters to various departments unanimously believes that "drawing cadres from production departments is the main way to solve the shortage of basic construction cadres." Based on this idea, we have also stipulated several principles for the use of cadres: (1) Cadres in the basic construction department are only allowed to be transferred in, not out; (2) Students who are assigned to the plant in the future will all be sent to the basic construction department;
    (3) A large number of outstanding workers will be transferred from the plant to the basic construction department;
    (4) Each production unit will have a deputy director in charge, so that production will not be affected after the director is transferred. For the repair department in our plant, the task is relatively heavy, and its own strength is not strong. This time, the plant decided to transfer the department director, the Party branch secretary, and two engineers to the basic construction department. They actively promoted and trained cadres to fill the vacancies. Comrades in other production departments also made ideological and organizational preparations for transferring cadres. Therefore, although many cadres were transferred from the production department, the completion of production tasks was still guaranteed.
    Because the Party Committee's leadership ideology recognized the necessity of putting basic construction in the first place, and because all the cadres in the plant clarified the above two basic issues, the work of transferring cadres from the production side to the basic construction department was successfully completed.
    The vast majority of the cadres transferred to the basic construction department this time were leading cadres and technical personnel from the original production departments. In total, 63.4% of the technical personnel in the plant were transferred, of which engineers accounted for 61% of all engineers, 50% of the old cadres at or above the section chief level were transferred (excluding old cadres from the Public Security Department), and 12.9% of the staff below the section chief level were transferred. The original propaganda minister of the plant's Party Committee was transferred to serve as the secretary of the Basic Construction Department's Party Branch. Jia Shuyuan (Party member), the head of the Technical Education Section, was transferred to the Basic Construction Department as the deputy director. Ma Xifan (Party member), the administrative deputy director of the plant, was transferred to serve as the manager of the Engineering Company. The original vice chairman of the plant's trade union and the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch were transferred to the basic construction department to lead the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League. Comrade Zhou Guanwu, the original deputy director of the plant, initially felt that the work of the basic construction department was difficult to handle and not as convenient as production. After this study, he not only actively requested to go to the basic construction post but also expressed that he "must learn well from data collection, design construction, machine installation to production." Other comrades who were transferred to the basic construction department also started working and studying with the same enthusiasm. This expanded and enriched the basic construction organization and strengthened the leadership in basic construction work.
    We have learned that to do any work well, we must strengthen the Party's ideological leadership. The reason why we were able to open this gate this time and boldly and substantially transfer and promote cadres to the basic construction department is because, under the guidance of the superior Party's instructions, all our cadres took a step forward ideologically through serious study. In the past, we had short-sightedness and didn't see how to go the next step after taking this step. After this study, our eyes were brightened, and we could see further. However, this is only the beginning of putting basic construction in a primary position, and we will never be satisfied with this. We must continue to work hard with humility and caution and strive to realize national industrialization.

    我们认识了基本建设的重要
    石景山钢铁厂党委书记  崔映国
    石景山钢铁厂的基本建设工作早在一九五○年就开始了，但是，从党委领导思想上来检查，切实把基本建设放在首要地位，还是最近一个月的事。
    自一九五○年建立基本建设处以来，我们长期得不到解决的就是机构薄弱干部缺乏的问题。一九五一年底，全处职工不足百人，其中只有六个党员；“三反”运动以后，虽然抽调了十几个技术人员，吸收了几十个技工，但由于缺乏老干部作领导骨干，特别是在基本建设中没有形成党的领导核心，以致设计力量不足，工作效率不高，内部显得紊乱。基本建设处没有完整的财务、工务、设计和施工的制度，有时一个工程连最起码的备料预算都没有。有的工程师这样说：“作了再说，作错了将来检讨吧！”因此造成不少返工浪费的现象。今年我厂基本建设工程共十项任务，只完成了六项，其主要原因是设计工作没有作好。例如：修理铸铁机时，我们的工程师只是抄了人家一份修理计划，并没有很好地研究分析这个铸铁机的具体毛病，结果化了很多钱，修理了一年多，不能很好地发挥铸铁机的作用。对于这些问题，党组织并没有采取积极的办法，及时加以解决。今年七月以后，领导方面虽然派了一个副厂长，两个党务工作的干部，和一部分技术工人到基本建设处工作，但由于厂内党政领导干部对基本建设的重要性认识不足，不肯放手调出更多的干部到基本建设部门工作，结果这个很重要而又很薄弱的机构，终于不能迅速地加强起来。今年九、十两月两次党委会议研究了给基本建设部门调配干部问题，当时决定调六个技术人员，结果只调了四个，还“借”了两个。原来提出要先抽出两个科长级的老干部到基本建设部门去，但结果连
    一个也没有抽出。
    十一月中旬，中央人民政府重工业部召开了全国厂矿长会议，人民日报发表了“把基本建设放在首要地位”的社论，这才向我们敲起了响亮的警钟。我们以三天的学习时间，向全厂共产党员、行政工作人员、工会和青年团干部作了动员，并组织了学习讨论。至此全厂领导干部在思想上闹清了两个问题：
    第一，把基本建设放在首要地位的问题，就是国家工业化的问题。在此以前，很多同志包括我们领导干部在内，把基本建设局限在修修补补的小的方面，而对更多更大的厂矿的建设很少考虑。即使有的同志偶然想到这个问题，也认为“这是上边的事”。因而有不少的工作干部只满足于追求完成当前的生产数字，而对于如何为明天更大规模的生产创造条件，则缺乏明确的远见。这样一来，自然而然地形成了自上而下对基本建设不够重视的现象。经这次学习讨论，很多同志反映：“我们要从生产方面抽出干部，把基本建设机构建立起来”。过去所谓“人少事多忙不过来”，“生产上离不开”，“干部太弱”等等不正确的保守的消极的想法，都受到了严厉地批判。因为在新的更复杂、更艰巨的任务面前，只有积极地培养、提拔工厂管理干部和技术人员，不断地发展与壮大自己的力量，才可能赶上国家建设的需要。
    其次，要做好基本建设，为国家工业化创造条件，首先必须把我们现有的力量充分发挥出来。以前我们很多领导干部在充分运用现有力量这一问题上，是存在着保守和依赖思想的。调干部等上级解决，不肯从生产部门抽调。只希望要现成的技术人员，不从培养技术人员着眼。可是现在从厂部到各部门的领导方面一致认为“从生产部门抽出干部，是解决基本建设干部不足的主要方法”。在这个思想基础上，我们又规定了使用干部的几个原则：（一）基本建设部门的干部只许调进，不得调出；（二）今后分配来厂的学生，一律派到基本建设部门；
    （三）从厂内抽调大批优秀职工到基本建设部门；
    （四）各生产单位主管设副职，以便正职抽调后，生产不受影响。修理部在本厂来说任务是比较繁重的，同时本身的力量并不强，这次厂里决定由该部调出部主任、党总支书记和两个工程师到基本建设部门去，他们则积极地提拔和培养干部，补充缺额。其他每个生产部门的同志也都作了抽调干部的思想准备和组织准备。因此，虽然在生产部门抽调了不少干部，但是仍然保证完成生产任务。
    由于党委的领导思想认识了把基本建设放在第一位的必要性，由于全厂干部弄清了以上两个基本问题，从生产方面抽调干部到基本建设部门去的工作便顺利地完成了。
    这次抽调到基本建设部门工作的绝大部分干部都是原生产部门的领导干部和技术人员。全厂总计在技术人员中抽调了百分之六十三·四，其中抽出的工程师占全部工程师人数的百分之六十一，科长级以上的老干部中抽出了百分之五十（不包括公安处老干部），科长以下的工作人员中抽出了百分之十二·九。原工厂党委会宣传部长调任基本建设处分党委会书记，技术教育科科长贾曙渊（党员），调到基本建设处担任副处长，行政副厂长马洗凡（党员），调到工程公司任经理。原来厂工会副主席、青年团支部副书记都调到基本建设部门去，领导工会和青年团的工作。原工厂副厂长周冠五同志，开始总觉得基本建设部门工作难搞，不如搞生产方便，经过这次学习，不但积极地要求到基本建设岗位上去，而且表示“一定要从资料收集、设计施工、机器安装直到生产，来好好学习”。其他调往基本建设部门去的同志也是以同样的热情开始工作和学习。这样就扩大和充实了基本建设机构，加强了基本建设工作的领导力量。
    我们体会到：要做好任何工作，都必须加强党的思想领导。我们这次所以能打开这一关，大胆地大量地抽调提拔干部到基本建设部门，就是因为在上级党的指示下，我们全体干部通过认真的学习，在思想上提高了一步。过去我们眼光短小，走了这一步，看不到下一步应如何走法。这次学习后，我们眼睛亮了，看得远了。不过，这仅仅是把基本建设放在首要地位的开始，我们决不以此满足。我们一定要虚心、谨慎地继续努力，为实现国家工业化而奋斗。
