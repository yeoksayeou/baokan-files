Following the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, workers in North China are enthusiastically learning Russian in order to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and to welcome the country's large-scale economic construction. In Shanxi Province, five special districts and Taiyuan City have established a total of 40 Russian language learning classes and night schools, with a total of more than 4,600 worker and cadre students. The radio Russian language lecture series sponsored by the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will begin on January 15th next year. More than 30,000 people are actively requesting to enroll. Recently, more than 600 workers at the Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan have actively requested to learn Russian. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of Tangjiazhuang Mine has specially hired three Soviet teachers from Harbin to establish Russian language learning classes. The workers are very enthusiastic about learning. Some departments have included "Learning Russian, ensuring no lateness or early departure, and no dropping out halfway" in their patriotic covenants. Many students have demonstrated a spirit of hard study. Several cadres from the Suiyuan Province Forestry Experimental Farm walk seven or eight miles through the snow every day to persist in learning. At present, the biggest difficulty encountered in various places is the lack of teachers. In the Ulanqab League of Suiyuan Province, more than 800 cadres and students have registered to learn Russian, but classes have not been started because teachers cannot be found. In Baoding City, Hebei Province, there is only one teacher for three Russian language learning classes, which prevents Russian language learning from proceeding normally. Various localities are now trying to hire and train teachers in an effort to quickly solve the problem of teachers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北各地职工热烈学习俄文
    华北各地经过“中苏友好月”活动后，广大职工为了学习苏联先进经验，迎接国家大规模的经济建设，正热烈学习俄文。山西省五个专区和太原市共开办四十个俄文学习班和夜校，工人、干部学员共四千六百多人。天津市中苏友好协会主办的广播俄语讲座，将在明年一月十五日开课，现在积极要求报名参加学习的已达三万多人。唐山开滦煤矿唐家庄矿最近有六百多职工积极要求学习俄文，唐家庄矿的中苏友好协会特从哈尔滨聘来三位苏联教员，成立俄文学习班。职工们学习热情很高，有些部门的职工并将“学习俄文，保证不迟到不早退，不中途退学”订入爱国公约中。许多学员在学习中，发挥了艰苦学习的精神。绥远省林业试验场的几个干部每天冒雪走七、八里路坚持学习。目前，各地所遇到的最大困难是缺乏师资。绥远省乌兰察布盟有八百多名干部、学生报名学习俄文，因为请不到教员，一直没有开课。河北省保定市三个俄文学习班，也只有一位教员，致使俄文学习不能正常进行。各地现正设法聘请和培养教员，争取迅速解决师资问题。（新华社）
