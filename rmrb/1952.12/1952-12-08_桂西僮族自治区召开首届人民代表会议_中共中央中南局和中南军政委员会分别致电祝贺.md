Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 7th: The first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups and all circles in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province opened in Nanning City on December 6th. In his speech at the opening ceremony, Qin Yingji (Zhuang nationality), Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, pointed out: A total of 776 representatives participated in this conference, including representatives of the Zhuang, Yao, Dong, Miao, Maonan, Lolo, Hui, Gelao, Lailai, Mulao, Shui, Han and other ethnic groups and people from all walks of life, as well as representatives of various democratic parties, the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, and people's organizations. This not only demonstrates the broad representation, but also shows that the conference possesses the authority to act on behalf of the People's Congress. The conference will ask everyone to discuss and approve the organizational regulations of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government; to negotiate and elect the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and members of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and to formally form the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government Committee. In addition, it will also study and discuss various administrative and construction tasks after the establishment of the autonomous region. Therefore, the political significance of this conference is very significant, and it will bring infinite light and happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in Guixi.

The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region is the first autonomous region at the level of an administrative office established in China after liberation. In terms of population, it is the largest autonomous region in the country. Therefore, the Central People's Government, the Central-South Military and Political Committee, and the Guangxi Provincial People's Government all attach great importance to it. The State Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission sent representative Liu Geping, and the Central-South Military and Political Committee and the CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau sent representative Zhang Zhiyi to guide the conference. In their speeches, they pointed out: The Zhuang nationality is a nation with a long history. Like all ethnic groups in the country, they are hardworking, brave and excellent, and have made great contributions to the revolutionary cause of the motherland. They firmly believe that after the establishment of the autonomous region, the development in political, economic, cultural and educational fields will surely guide the people of all ethnic groups in Guixi to a broad path, and will inevitably have a positive political impact at home and abroad. Chen Manyuan, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, said in his speech: The convening of this conference and the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government are a great achievement in promoting the ethnic regional autonomy movement in Guangxi Province, and also a symbol of the unity of the Zhuang people and other fraternal ethnic groups in the province. Guests from Guangdong, Hunan, Henan and other provinces representing the Li, Miao, Hui, Han and other ethnic groups also delivered speeches successively, congratulating the success of the conference.

Before the opening of the first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups and all circles in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, representatives from various regions and all sectors of society gathered in Nanning to study the ethnic policies for three days. During the study, the representatives not only resolved the issues of why the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region should be established and the relations between the various ethnic groups in the autonomous region, but also deliberated on opinions on various administrative and construction tasks of the autonomous region in the future, and collected the representatives' proposals for the conference. All these activities have prepared the ideological groundwork for the success of this conference. The representatives have truly realized the glorious and important responsibility of being masters of their own affairs during the study. They unanimously stated that they must hold the representative conference well and lay the foundation for the great development of the autonomous region in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 7th: The CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau sent a congratulatory telegram to the opening of the first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups and all circles in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The congratulatory telegram stated:

The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region is about to be established on the victorious foundation of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government's three years of implementing the great Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. The establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region will surely guide the people of all ethnic groups in Guixi onto the road of development and prosperity.

The congratulatory telegram continued: To this end, we call on the people of all ethnic groups in Guixi, especially the Zhuang people, to make a hundredfold effort to strengthen ethnic unity and, together with all ethnic groups in the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, jointly build a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups - the People's Republic of China. All levels of staff in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region should actively serve the people of all ethnic groups, especially Han cadres should work with peace of mind, establish the determination to serve the minority ethnic people for life, guard against arrogance and impatience, and sincerely cooperate with cadres of all ethnic groups in a friendly manner. We have specially sent Zhang Zhiyi, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau, to represent us in offering congratulations. And extend to you our heartfelt respect!

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 7th: The Central-South Military and Political Committee sent a telegram congratulating the opening of the first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups and all circles in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The congratulatory telegram stated: Since liberation, the Zhuang people and the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is about to be established, have united strongly under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, given play to the fine qualities of diligence and bravery, and victoriously created the conditions for establishing their own ethnic autonomous region. Now the People's Government of the Autonomous Region is about to be established. This is the beginning of the Zhuang people embarking on a great and happy life together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country. In the future, we hope to consolidate the unity around the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, and under the direct leadership of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, give greater play to initiative and creativity, strengthen patriotic education, love the great People's Motherland, actively participate in national defense and production activities, steadily develop various constructions, improve the politics, economy and culture of all ethnic groups, and strive to complete the common cause of people's democracy.
