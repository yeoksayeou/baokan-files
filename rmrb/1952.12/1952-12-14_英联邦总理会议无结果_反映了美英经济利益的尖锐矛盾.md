Xinhua News Agency, London, December 13th: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which opened in London on November 27, closed on December 11. The divisions within the Commonwealth that ran through the conference reflected the sharp contradictions in economic interests between the United States and Britain. As a result, the conference failed to formulate any practical and effective plans to strengthen the position of Britain and the sterling area and improve the financial and trade situation of the sterling area.

    At the conference, a fierce dispute erupted between the Commonwealth countries reflecting the American viewpoint and Britain. Canada, Australia, and other countries that leaned towards the United States insisted on lifting import restrictions on federal countries and restoring the free convertibility of the pound sterling to facilitate the further intrusion of dollar power into the sterling area. However, this proposition failed due to Britain's firm resistance. The communique issued by the conference demonstrated Britain's point of view, stating clearly that given the current dire situation of the sterling area's gold and dollar reserves, it is necessary to continue to restrict the import of foreign goods. As for whether import restrictions can be relaxed in the future, it depends on "the degree of progress made in achieving balance between the United States and other countries." The communique believes that the free convertibility of the pound sterling can only be realized on the premise that the federal payment situation improves and foreign trade expands. At the same time, the conference continued to express support for the imperial preferential tariff system opposed by the United States and its influenced federal countries, and agreed that Britain has the right to request countries participating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva to allow it to increase tariffs on certain imported goods in order to "protect (British) domestic industry and agriculture."
    On the other hand, Britain's attempt to strengthen its control over the sterling area to counter the United States also failed due to opposition from Canada and Australia. Britain's proposal to expand internal imperial tariff preferences at the conference was rejected. Britain also had to agree to encourage American capital investment in the sterling area, deciding to relax restrictions on American investment and allowing foreign investors to transfer capital profits. The communique specifically stated that Commonwealth countries must obtain "the cooperation of the United States."
    Due to irreconcilable major differences, the conference only decided on some empty principles, including expanding the sterling area's foreign trade, intensifying the development of federal countries' resources, stabilizing the sterling area's raw material prices, and improving the sterling area's international payment situation, etc.
    The conference shows that Britain is trying to continue to rely on the United States to solve its economic difficulties. Therefore, whether any resolution of the Federal Conference to improve the economic status of the sterling area can be realized depends on the outcome of negotiations with the United States. The conference's communique proves this point, believing that to restore "economic balance" between Britain and the United States, it is first necessary to rely on "reaching an agreement between creditor countries (referring to the United States) and debtor countries." Officials participating in the Federal Conference directly admitted that "the success of the federal plan depends on the cooperation of the United States" (Reuters). According to news released during the conference, British Prime Minister Churchill is prepared to visit the United States in March next year to beg for "assistance" from the United States.
    However, the policy of continuing to rely on the United States will never solve but only deepen the economic disaster of Britain and the Commonwealth countries. In this case, any efforts by the Commonwealth countries will still lead to a dead end. In view of the bleak prospects of the British economy, commentators in the British bourgeois press do not conceal their disappointment with the Federal Conference. Even while the conference was still in progress, the conservative "Observer" had already concluded: "This conference will absolutely not come up with any magical solutions. The agreement may just be a pile of waste paper."

    英联邦总理会议无结果
    反映了美英经济利益的尖锐矛盾
    【新华社十三日讯】伦敦消息：十一月二十七日在伦敦召开的英联邦总理会议已于十二月十一日闭幕。贯穿在会议进程中的英联邦内部的分歧，反映出美英经济利益的尖锐矛盾。由于这种情况，会议在加强英国和英镑区地位、改善英镑区财政贸易状况方面，未能制订任何切实有效的方案。
    在会议上，反映美国观点的英联邦国家和英国之间曾展开激烈的争吵。倒向美国怀抱的加拿大、澳大利亚等国坚持取消联邦国家的进口限制，恢复英镑的自由兑换，以便于美元势力进一步侵入英镑区。但是，这种主张由于遭到英国的坚决抵抗而未能实现。会议发表的公报表明了英国的观点，公报明白表示：在目前英镑区黄金美元储备十分窘迫的情况下，必须继续实行限制外国货入口，至于将来能否放松入口限制，要看“在美国和其他国家之间获致平衡方面的进展程度而定”。公报认为，英镑的自由兑换，必须在联邦支付情况好转和对外贸易扩大的前提之下才能实现。同时，会议对于美国及其影响下的联邦国家所反对的帝国特惠关税制继续表示支持，并且同意英国有权要求参加日内瓦关税贸易总协定的各国准许它提高对某些进口货的关税，以“保护（英国）国内工业和农业”。
    另一方面，英国打算加强对英镑区的控制以对抗美国的企图，在加拿大、澳大利亚的反对下也归于失败。英国在会议上提出的扩大帝国内部关税特惠制的建议遭到了否决。英国还不得不同意鼓励美国资本向英镑区投资，决定放宽对美国投资的限制，准许外国投资人转移资本利润。公报特别声明，英联邦国家必须取得“美国的合作”。
    由于无法调和的重大分歧，会议只决定了一些空洞的原则，其中包括扩大英镑区对外贸易，加紧开发联邦国家的资源，稳定英镑区原料价格，改善英镑区国际支付状况等等。
    会议表明：英国企图继续依靠美国来解决它的经济困难。因此，联邦会议的一切改善英镑区经济地位的决议之能否实现，都要决定于和美国协商的结果。会议的公报证明了这一点，它认为要恢复英国和美国之间的“经济平衡”，首先要依靠“在债权国（指美国）和债务国之间取得协议”。参加联邦会议的官方人士直截了当地承认，“联邦计划能否成功须视美国的合作而定”（路透社）。根据会议期间传出的消息，英国首相邱吉尔已准备在明年三月访问美国，以乞求美国的“协助”。
    但是，继续仰承美国鼻息的政策决不可能解救而只有加深英国和英联邦国家的经济灾难。在这种情况下，英联邦国家的任何努力仍然脱不出死路一条。鉴于英国经济的黯淡前途，英国资产阶级报纸的评论家毫不掩饰他们对联邦会议的失望。甚至在会议还在进行的时候，保守的“观察家报”就已作出了结论：“这次会议绝对提不出任何神奇的方案。协议也许只是废纸一堆。”
