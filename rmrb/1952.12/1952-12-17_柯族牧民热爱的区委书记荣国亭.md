    Rong Guoting, the District Committee Secretary Beloved by the Kirgiz Herdsmen
    Chen Yi

    In Xinjiang Province, on the frontier of our motherland, there are many cadres who came from the interior to work. They have overcome various difficulties, learned the local ethnic languages, and become good servants wholeheartedly serving the fraternal ethnic groups. Comrade Rong Guoting, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Pu Li County (one of the residences of the Kirgiz people), is one of them.

    When Comrade Rong Guoting first arrived at his post, he first encountered the unique cold climate of the plateau, the scattered nomadic life of the herdsmen, and the occasional discovery of one or two tents after walking hundreds of miles. Sometimes, he couldn't even find the relocated township government after walking for days, coupled with the language barrier and lack of work experience. This series of problems, which he had never imagined before, were placed before him.

    Could he complete the Party's tasks under such circumstances? Comrade Rong Guoting thought: In the past, in the war environment, he often didn't sleep for several days and nights, carrying heavy telecommunications equipment, walking hundreds of miles a day, and connecting telephone lines on the battlefield amidst gunfire, risking his life. He was gloriously credited three times. Could he shrink back in the face of new difficulties today? He clearly remembered the encouragement his superiors gave him when he left the army: "The more difficult it is, the more glorious it is. Overcoming difficulties is victory." These words encouraged him to overcome difficulties and realize the Party's hope. He often braved the wind and sun, crossed mountains and rivers, regardless of the distance, to visit the lives and production of the herdsmen from tent to tent, publicizing the Party's ethnic policies and policies for developing animal husbandry. During his visits, he personally witnessed the miserable and impoverished lives that the reactionary rulers had brought to the herdsmen, and he shed tears of sadness. The herdsmen told him about the crimes of oppression and plunder committed by the Kuomintang reactionaries against all ethnic groups as if they were his own relatives. All of this redoubled his determination to serve the fraternal ethnic groups wholeheartedly for a long time. At that time, the serious problem facing the herdsmen was the lack of food. Many herdsmen couldn't even drink milk. He consulted with local ethnic cadres and decided to mobilize the herdsmen to help each other and engage in sideline production such as hunting to solve the food shortage. In his work, he sometimes had to cross three mountains and rivers a dozen times a day. He worked tirelessly all day long, and only at night did he drag his tired body to sleep in a dilapidated, drafty tent. After his and other cadres' day and night hard work, they finally helped six or seventy herdsmen's families in the district to get through the difficult spring. Kurban Halik, a herdsman, killed 95 wolves, foxes, and argali sheep in March, which, in addition to providing for his family, were exchanged for 4,400 pounds of flour and enough cloth for the whole family to make clothes. Rong Guoting's arduous work style moved the masses. The herdsmen unanimously praised him, saying: "Chairman Mao's cadres care about the interests of the people and completely forget about themselves."

    The biggest problem for Comrade Rong Guoting in his work was the language barrier. He deeply felt that because of the language barrier, the Party's policies could not be well implemented, and close ties could not be established with the cadres and the masses. He thought: If he wanted to work here for a long time, how could he not learn the local ethnic language? Once, an old herdsman rode his horse from dozens of miles away to the district committee to find him, but the translator was not there. The old man earnestly gestured and spoke, and from his expression, it could be seen that he was anxious. But Rong Guoting couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally, the elderly herdsman had to return disappointed. Rong Guoting was also very anxious and sad at the time. From then on, he made up his mind to learn the local ethnic language. He encountered many difficulties in his studies, but he overcame them all with his strong will. He thought: In the past, he didn't know a single Chinese character. After joining the People's Liberation Army, he studied culture in the tense combat environment and even reached the level of higher primary school. Now that the learning conditions are better than in the past, can't he still learn? He mustered his courage and made up his mind to learn the local ethnic language within two years. If he was busy with work and didn't have time, he would study anytime, anywhere. When he found commonly used words in his work, he would write them down. Late at night, he would memorize the words he learned that day like an elementary school student reciting a text. He also made a mutual teaching and learning contract with the district chief, Baba Yezha, and several other district government cadres. He learned Kirgiz from the district chief, and the district chief learned Han Chinese from him. This further enhanced their revolutionary friendship. When they went to various townships to check on work, they were no longer as lonely as before on the long roads, because they also learned languages from each other while walking. The masses were often happy when he could say a Kirgiz sentence. After he had some basic knowledge of the local ethnic language, in the winter of 1951, he went to the herdsmen's night school every day to learn the local ethnic characters, regardless of his fatigue.

    In the spring of 1951, at the Kashgar Special District Cadre Conference, Comrade Rong Guoting was named a model cadre. At that time, Wang Enmao, Secretary of the Southern Xinjiang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, encouraged him to study humbly, work hard, and make greater achievements for the fraternal ethnic groups. Thanks to the Party's continuous education and his own hard work, he is now able to read Uyghur newspapers and reports written to him by rural cadres and can simply reply to them. He can go out to work alone without a translator. He excitedly said: "Now, I have ears and a mouth (meaning I can understand and speak Kirgiz), and I can do more things for the Party and the Kirgiz people." Indeed, after he mastered the language, the masses often talked to him. Once, he had a cordial conversation with the village chief of Borodi in the Third Township for several hours. The village chief happily said: "In the past, our languages were not compatible, as if a wall blocked us. Now there is nothing in the middle to stop us."

    The work performance of the Fourth District of Puli County this year is very outstanding. In the spring, according to the specific conditions of the four townships, four grassland management committees were established, and seasonal grasslands were divided according to the climate and grassland size of each township. In the summer, Comrade Rong Guoting led many cadres to first mobilize the herdsmen in the Second Township to build livestock pens and cultivate grasslands. He specifically helped Aishan Baek establish two large and small grasslands and build a livestock pen. As a result, Aishan Baek's livestock did not lose a single one. Rong Guoting used this example to publicize and promote the construction of 37 livestock pens in the entire district and carried out fertilization and watering on 85 grasslands. This year, the Fourth District also organized local medical treatment for livestock diseases and sentries to fight wolves and other measures to protect livestock and increase production, so that this year's livestock grew very strong, and the survival rate of young livestock reached 89 percent. In addition, the grasslands also circulated such a good deed done by Comrade Rong Guoting for them: the Third Township of the district had more sheep and smaller grasslands, while the Second Township had fewer sheep and larger grasslands. In the past, due to the instigation of reactionary rulers, the two townships were not united. Therefore, even if the sheep in the Third Township were starving to death, the people in the Second Township would not allow them to graze on their grasslands. After Comrade Rong Guoting and local cadres publicized and explained the policies for developing animal husbandry, and after democratic consultation, the two townships presented a new atmosphere of unity and friendship. Now, more than 5,000 sheep from the Third Township are freely grazing on the grasslands of the Second Township. Shatayer, a herdsman from the Third Township, said: "Our cattle and sheep are growing fat and strong this year, and the young livestock are free from disease. This is all the blessing given by Chairman Mao." Under the leadership of Comrade Rong Guoting, animal husbandry in the Fourth District has developed greatly. In 1949, there were more than 5,000 livestock in the entire district, which has developed to more than 13,000 this year, nearly doubling, and the lives of the herdsmen have also improved accordingly.

    The herdsmen deeply love this district committee secretary who wholeheartedly works for them. One day, he went to the tent of herdsman Uman, and Uman's whole family warmly prepared milk tea for him. Uman took his hand and said with tears of gratitude: "We will never forget you, a hard worker for us!" Uman told him: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the number of livestock has increased fourfold in the past three years, and our lives have improved. My family has recently bought a new tent, and the people in the family are also wearing foreign cloth clothes." On another occasion, he was working in the Kenshba pasture and lived in the home of Zu Neng, a cadre of the district government. The old herdsman Tashitiemir ran over and repeatedly asked him to live in his tent. He didn't go. The herdsman quietly moved his luggage to his tent while he was out working, and happily said: "This way, you have to live here, right?" From here, we can see how deep the feelings of Comrade Rong Guoting and the local herdsmen are!

    柯族牧民热爱的区委书记荣国亭
    陈易
    在祖国边疆的新疆省，有不少从内地去的干部在那里工作。他们克服了种种困难，学会了当地民族语言，成为全心全意为兄弟民族服务的好勤务员。中共蒲犁县（柯尔克兹族居住地之一）第四区区委书记荣国亭同志，就是其中的一个。
    荣国亭同志刚到工作岗位，首先遇到的是高原上特有的寒冷气候，牧民分散的游牧生活，走百、八十里路才偶然发现一、二顶帐篷，有时甚至走了几天的路还找不到乡政府移居的地方，加之语言不通，工作经验缺乏。这一连串的问题摆在他的面前，都是他以前没有想像到的。
    在这样的情况下能完成党的任务么？荣国亭同志想：过去在战争环境中，常常几昼夜不合眼，背着沉重的电讯器材，一天走一百几十里路，还在炮火连天的阵地上，冒着生命的危险接电话线。光荣地立过三次功。难道今天碰到新的困难，能畏缩不前吗？他清楚地记得离开部队时首长对他的勉励：“越是艰苦越光荣，克服了困难就是胜利。”这些话鼓舞着他决心克服困难，实现党的希望。他常不避风吹日晒、跋山涉水，不顾道路远近，从这个帐篷到另一个帐篷，去访问牧民的生活和生产情况；宣传党的民族政策和发展畜牧业的政策。在访问中，他亲眼看到过去反动统治者带给牧民的凄惨贫困的生活，他难过得掉下了眼泪。牧民们像亲人一样地向他诉说着国民党反动派压迫、掠夺各族人民的罪行。这些，都百倍地增强了他长期地全心全意地为兄弟民族服务的决心。当时，摆在牧民面前的严重问题是没有吃的，许多牧民连奶子也喝不上，他和当地民族干部商量，决定发动牧民互助互济，并进行打猎等副业生产来解决缺吃的问题。在工作中，他有时一天要翻越三座大山、过十几次河。他不辞辛劳地整天工作着，到夜晚才拖着疲乏的身子睡在破不挡风的帐篷里。经过他及其他干部日夜辛勤的工作，终于使全区六、七十家牧民度过了困难的春天。牧民库尔班哈力三月中共打了狼、狐、大角羊九十五只，除了供全家吃用外，还换得四千四百斤面粉和全家穿衣的布匹。荣国亭的艰苦作风，感动了群众，牧民们一致赞扬说：“毛主席的干部关心人民的利益完全忘记了自己。”
    荣国亭同志在工作中最大的苦恼就是语言不通。他深深感到因为语言不通，党的政策不能很好的贯彻，和干部、群众也不能建立起密切的联系。他想：要长期在这里工作，不学习当地民族语言怎么行呢？有一次，一个老牧民骑着马从几十里外的地方到区委会找他，但翻译不在，那个老乡诚挚地一面比划一面说，从表情上可以看出他的焦急的心情来。但荣国亭怎么也弄不清他究竟有什么事。最后，那个年老的牧民只得失望地回去了。荣国亭当时也十分焦急和难过，从此，他便下定决心学习当地民族语言。在学习中曾遇到过不少的困难，但都被他顽强的意志克服了。他想：过去自己一个汉字也不识，参加解放军后，在紧张的战斗环境中学习文化，还达到了高小程度；现在学习条件比过去好，还学不会吗？他鼓起了勇气，下定决心要在两年之内一定把当地民族语言学会。工作忙，没时间，他就随时随地的学习；在工作中发现常用的词，就把它记下来。在深夜里他还像小学生背书一样的记忆当天学会的话。他并和区长巴巴耶札等几个区政府的干部，订立了互教互学合同，他向区长学柯族话，区长向他学汉族话，这样就更增进了他俩的革命友谊。当他俩到各乡检查工作时，走在漫长的路上再不像以前那样寂寞了，因为他们在走路时也互相学习着语言。群众常为他会说一句柯族话而高兴。他对当地的民族语言学得有些底子后，在一九五一年冬天，他又不顾疲劳地每天到牧民的夜校中去学习当地民族的文字了。
    一九五一年春天，在喀什专区干部会议上，荣国亭同志被评为模范干部，当时中共南疆区党委书记王恩茂同志曾鼓励他：虚心学习，努力工作，为兄弟民族作出更大的工作成绩。由于党对他不断的教育和他自己的勤奋学习。现在，他已能阅读维文报纸及乡村干部写给他的报告，并能简单地批复。他能不带翻译单独出去进行工作了。他兴奋地说：“现在，我有了耳朵有了嘴（意即能听懂和会说柯族话），能给党和柯族人民做更多的事情了。”的确，在他学通语言以后，群众经常找他谈话，有一次他和三乡波罗地村长亲切地交谈了几个钟头，村长高兴地说：“以前我们的语言不通，好像一堵墙把我们挡住似的，现在没有任何东西在中间阻挡我们了。”
    今年蒲犁县第四区的工作成绩是很出色的。春天，根据四个乡的具体情况，成立了四个草场管理委员会，又按各乡的气候、草场大小等条件划分了四季草场。夏天，荣国亭同志带领许多干部首先在二乡发动牧民进行修建畜圈，培植草场的工作。他具体地帮助艾山伯克建立了大小两个草场，修了一个畜圈，结果艾山伯克的牲畜连一只也没损失。荣国亭即以这个例子进行宣传，推动全区修了三十七个畜圈，并在八十五个草场上进行了施肥、浇水等培植工作。四区今年还进行组织土法医疗畜病及放哨打狼等保畜增产工作，使今年的牲畜长得很健旺，幼畜的成活率达到了百分之八十九。此外，草场上还传颂着荣国亭同志给他们办的这样一件好事：该区三乡羊多草场小，二乡羊少草场大，过去因反动统治者的挑拨离间，两个乡互不团结，因此，三乡的羊就是饿死了，二乡的人也不让到自己的草场上放牧。荣国亭同志和当地干部宣传解释了发展畜牧业的政策后，又经过了民主协商，两个乡呈现了团结友爱的新气象。现在，三乡已有五千多只羊自由放牧在二乡的草场了。三乡牧民沙台尔说：“我们的牛羊今年长得又肥又壮，幼畜也没有疾病，这都是毛主席给的福气。”在荣国亭同志的领导下，四区的畜牧业有了很大发展。一九四九年全区共有牲畜五千多只，到今年已发展到一万三千多只，将近增加了二倍，牧民的生活也随之改善了。
    牧民们对这位全心全意为他们工作的区委书记非常热爱。有一天，他到了牧民乌曼的帐篷，乌曼全家人热情地给他准备奶茶；乌曼拉住他的手，含着感激的眼泪说：“我们永远忘不了你这个为我们辛勤的人！”乌曼告诉他：“在共产党、人民政府的领导下，三年来牲畜增加了四倍，生活改善了。我家最近新置了一顶帐篷，家里的人也穿上了洋布衣服。”另一次，他在肯什巴牧场工作，住在区政府干部足能的家里。老牧民塔什铁米尔跑来，再三要求他到自己帐篷去住。他不去。那个牧民趁他出去工作时，悄悄把他的行李搬到自己的帐篷里去，并高兴地说：“这样你非住不可了吧？”从这里，我们可以看到：荣国亭同志与当地牧民的感情是多么深厚啊！
