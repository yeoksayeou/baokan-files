Xinhua News Agency, December 27th:

    The Central People's Government Higher Education Department held its inaugural meeting on December 25th. Simultaneously, the Central People's Government Higher Education Department and the Central People's Government Education Department jointly held a ministerial inauguration ceremony.

    Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, delivered important instructions at the meeting. He pointed out that in the past three years, the Ministry of Education has achieved great success in completing restoration work, which is reflected in the early completion of preparatory work for developing education. In the future, the country will begin large-scale planned construction, and the past education leadership structure can no longer adapt to the needs of the new situation. It is necessary to divide it into two departments to manage the country's education. The new tasks require planned implementation, distinguishing between urgency and focusing efforts on key education undertakings. Work should not simply pursue quantity but should focus on quality. The current central task is to formulate plans. To formulate good plans, it is necessary to oppose both conservatism and prevent the plans from being too large and unrealistic.

    Ma Xulun, Minister of Higher Education, pointed out in his speech that after the establishment of the Higher Education Department, it will undertake the task of specially training senior and middle-level construction cadres for the country, and continuously supply a sufficient number of qualified technical talents according to the needs of national construction, especially industrial construction. To this end, it is first necessary to complete the thorough reform of universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools, mainly industrial schools, to quickly and effectively train a large number of industrial construction cadres. Secondly, it is necessary to strive to overcome the tendency of pursuing quantity and neglecting quality in the development process of the past three years, vigorously carry out the study movement of Marxism-Leninism on the basis of teacher ideological reform and departmental adjustment, strengthen and improve the political and ideological leadership of the school to improve the ideological level of teaching work; and systematically carry out a criticism and self-criticism movement to examine the quality of teaching work and overcome the chaotic phenomena in schools, and further reform the teaching content, teaching methods, and the work of teaching and research groups.

    Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education, pointed out in his speech that the separation of higher education and general education into two departments reflects the increasing arduousness of education construction and the necessity of carrying out the necessary division of labor. The Higher Education Department is to closely cooperate with the requirements of national industrialization and train a large number of technical talents; the Education Department is to broadly improve the people's cultural level and educate the new generation of the motherland. He pointed out that the work tasks of the two departments are interconnected and mutually dependent. Therefore, the two departments must unite closely and strive together to complete the tasks of new democratic education construction.

    The Higher Education Department has nine divisions under it: the General Office, the Comprehensive University Education Division, the First Industrial Education Division, the Second Industrial Education Division, the Agricultural, Forestry, and Health Education Division, the Secondary Technical Education Division, the Overseas Students Management Division, the Teaching Guidance Division, the Planning and Finance Division, and the School Personnel Division, and three offices: the Political Education Office, the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School Education Office, and the Basic Construction Office.

    The Education Department has seven divisions under it: the General Office, the Higher Normal Education Division, the Secondary Normal Education Division, the Secondary School Education Division, the Primary School Education Division, the Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education Division, the National Education Division, and the Teaching Guidance Division, and four offices: the Planning and Finance Office, the Early Childhood Education Office, the Blind and Deaf Education Office, and the Sports Guidance Office.

    中央高等教育部举行成立大会
    文教委员会习仲勋副主任到会作重要指示
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府高等教育部在十二月二十五日举行成立大会，同时中央人民政府高等教育部与中央人民政府教育部联合举行部长就职典礼。
    文化教育委员会副主任习仲勋在会上作了重要指示，他指出：过去三年，教育部在完成恢复工作方面是有很大成绩的，这表现在提前完成了发展教育事业的准备工作。今后国家要开始进行大规模有计划的建设，过去的教育领导机构已不能适应新形势的需要，必须分成两个部来管理国家的教育事业。新的任务要求有计划地进行，要分清缓急，集中力量办好重点教育事业，工作不要单纯追求数量，要着重注意质量。目前的中心工作是订定计划。计划要订得好，必须一方面反对保守主义；另一方面防止把计划订得太大，不切合实际。
    高等教育部部长马叙伦在讲话中指出：高等教育部成立以后，将担负起专门培养国家高级和中级建设干部的任务，根据国家建设首先是工业建设的需要，源源不绝地供应足够数量的、合乎规格的技术人才。为此，首先要完成高等学校和中等技术学校、主要是工业学校的彻底改革，以便迅速有效地培养大量的工业建设的干部。其次要努力克服三年来发展过程中追求数量忽视质量的偏向，在教师思想改造和院系调整的基础上，大力开展马克思列宁主义的学习运动，加强和改进学校的政治思想领导，以提高教学工作的思想水平；并有步骤地开展一个检查教学工作质量、克服学校混乱现象的批评与自我批评运动，进一步改革教学内容、教学方法和教学研究组的工作。
    教育部部长张奚若在讲话中指出：高等教育和普通教育分设为两个部，反映了教育建设事业日益繁重而不能不进行必要的分工。高等教育部是为了紧密地配合国家工业化的要求，大量培养技术人才；教育部是为了广泛地提高人民文化水平，教育祖国新生的一代。他指出：两个部的工作任务是彼此衔接，互相依靠的。因此，两个部门必须亲密地团结，共同为完成新民主主义教育建设任务而奋斗。
    高等教育部下设办公厅，综合大学教育司、工业教育第一司、第二司、农林卫生教育司、中等技术教育司、留学生管理司、教学指导司、计划财务司、学校人事司等九个司和政治教育处、工农速成中学教育处、基本建设处等三个处。
