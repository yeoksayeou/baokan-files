(Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 14th) According to a TASS dispatch from Vienna on the 14th: The people of Vienna held a very grand parade on the 13th to celebrate the convening of the World People's Peace Congress.

At 3 o'clock local time, people began to pour into Stalin Square from all districts of Vienna. The marchers proceeded from there towards the Parliament Building and the stands where many delegates to the congress were standing and watching. These delegates included Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council, Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, Song Qingling, the famous public figure of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet writer Korneichuk, and the Austrian Member of Parliament Fischer, among many others.

The marchers warmly welcomed the envoys of the people of all countries of the world. The marchers cheered the following slogans in many languages: Peace, peace, peace! Long live the World People's Peace Congress! The citizens of Vienna welcome the great gathering of the people of all countries! We support peace and international friendship!

Railway workers, hardware workers, machine manufacturing workers, disabled veterans, housewives, artisans, merchants, representatives of the business community, students, and mothers holding babies, passed in an endless stream in front of the stands. They held blue banners and signs painted with peace symbols, with slogans written on the signs such as: "Peace is the happiness of the people, the happiness of all families!" "Mothers, our children need peace! Fight for peace!"

In the evening, torches were lit. The marchers repeatedly shouted these two precious words: "Peace."

Very moving scenes could be seen near the stands. Marchers approached the stands one after another to shake hands with the peace delegates attending the congress, or to present the delegates with flowers and flags with peace doves.

Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury and winner of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples", and delegates from West Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Sudan and Tunisia, greeted the marchers.

Tens of thousands of Vienna citizens participated in the parade.

At the beginning of the parade, the International Peace Relay Race, sponsored by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, arrived in Vienna. Amidst the storm of applause from hundreds of thousands of marchers, Olympic champion Zatopek handed the peace baton to Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council.

     维也纳人民游行庆祝世界人民和平大会
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十四日讯：维也纳人民为了庆祝世界人民和平大会的召开，于十三日举行了非常盛大的游行。
    在本地时间三点钟，人们开始从维也纳的各区涌向斯大林广场，游行者从这里朝着议会大厦和有许多大会代表站着观看的看台前进。这些代表们包括世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里、坎特伯雷教长约翰逊、中华人民共和国著名公众领袖宋庆龄、苏联作家考涅楚克、奥地利议会议员费希尔等多人。
    游行者热烈欢迎全世界各国人民的使者。游行者以许多种语言欢呼着下列口号：和平，和平，和平！世界人民和平大会万岁！维也纳的市民欢迎各国人民的伟大集会！我们拥护和平及国际友好！
    铁路工人、五金工人、机器制造工人、残废军人、家庭妇女、工匠、商人、企业界代表、学生及怀抱婴儿的母亲们，络绎不绝地从看台前面走过。他们手里拿着画着和平标志的蓝色旗幡和标语牌，标语牌上写着：“和平是人民的幸福，是一切家庭的幸福！”“母亲们，我们的孩子需要和平！争取和平！”
    到晚上，火炬燃烧起来。游行者反复高呼这两个宝贵的字：“和平”。
    在看台附近可以看到非常动人的场面。游行者一个又一个走近看台与参加大会的和平代表握手，或向代表们献花和献上有和平鸽的旗子。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的得奖人坎特伯雷教长约翰逊及来自西德、墨西哥、阿根廷、苏丹及突尼斯的代表们向游行者们致意。
    几万维也纳市民参加了游行。
    在游行开始时，世界民主青年联盟所主持的国际和平接力赛跑到了维也纳。在成千上万的游行者的暴风雨般掌声中，奥林匹克运动会优胜者萨托皮克把和平棍递到世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的手中。
