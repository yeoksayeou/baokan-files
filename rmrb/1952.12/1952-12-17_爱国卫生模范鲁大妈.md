    Model Patriotic Health Worker, Grandma Lu
    Xiao Feng
    Grandma Lu is an ordinary old woman with advanced ideas. In the Patriotic Health Campaign, she mobilized more than 1,400 people, cleaned thirteen residential sections, removed 19 tons of garbage, 16.5 tons of aquatic plants, collected 200 kilograms of mosquito larvae, eliminated 100 kilograms of fly maggots, and moved more than 200 dung bricks. In addition, she herself participated in 31 voluntary shock labor sessions, killing 40,000 mosquitoes, catching 20,000 flies...

    This 47-year-old Grandma Lu is the family member of a revolutionary soldier and an active street worker. She lives in Jianzi Alley in the Third District of Nanjing, a place where working people live. Due to the exploitation and oppression of reactionary rulers over the years, the environmental hygiene there is very poor, and residents generally do not pay attention to hygiene. When the Patriotic Health Campaign first started, most residents were not very enthusiastic, believing that "flies have always existed and can never be completely eliminated"; some women also had unfounded fears about injections, often hiding with their children as soon as they heard about vaccinations. Grandma Lu knew the significance of the Patriotic Health Campaign and, even more so, the principle that the campaign could only be successful by mobilizing the broad masses. Therefore, she first organized the core members around her, making them all realize the truth that "carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign is opposing the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism." Because Grandma Lu has been actively doing things for everyone for three years, she has a high reputation among the masses. Soon, a group of activists joined Grandma Lu in carrying out this work. Grandma Lu has no special leadership secrets, she does not force or command, only firmly remembering the eight words: "Key members, lead the way and work." Wherever she goes, she always starts by doing things herself to show the masses, helping them find working methods. She said: "Working with the masses is not enough to just talk, setting an example by doing something is the most effective way to mobilize the masses."

    In order to set an example for the masses, Grandma Lu first thoroughly cleaned up her own home before mobilizing others. To kill dogs, she first killed her own dog; to eliminate maggots, she first went to the cesspool to scoop them out. Some people say that rats can predict the future and cannot be caught. She first catches one for everyone to see; some people don't believe that rats have fleas, so she puts a rat in a fine lime basin to let them see what the black spots that fall out are. When encountering people who can't understand the ideas, she persuades them again and again. People who are unwilling to do hygiene work always emphasize how many difficulties they have, but Grandma Lu said: "Difficulties disappear once they are overcome." There was a large courtyard housing twenty-four working-class families. In the beginning, everyone emphasized that they "didn't have time" when hygiene work was mentioned. Grandma Lu learned about this situation and led the cleaning team to persuade them with practical actions. The first time, they silently swept out one and a half carts of garbage for them, the second time they swept out another cart, and when they went to sweep out half a cart of garbage the third time, the twenty-four families were so moved that they picked up their brooms, stopped the cleaning team and said: "If you sweep like this, what can we say, Grandma Lu! You must not come again! Hygiene is everyone's business, how can we always rely on you? We guarantee to do the work well!" Later, they really did a good job in the Patriotic Health Campaign.

    In the Patriotic Health Campaign, Grandma Lu doesn't wait for work to come to her, but runs around all day, looking for work objects everywhere. After she took the lead in helping eight residential sections with sixteen voluntary cleanups, she discovered that the weeds along the railroad tracks from Wuding Gate to Yuhua Gate were more than one person tall. She consulted with the masses, asking them if they should pull them out. With the consent of the masses, this old woman joined a group of young people to conquer that patch of weeds. It was still summer at that time, and working people needed to drink water the most. Grandma Lu pulled weeds while also taking the time to find boiled water for everyone to drink; she was even more considerate to women with children or household chores, urging them to go back when the time came; she herself insisted until the end.

    In Jianzi Alley, where Grandma Lu lives, there is a 30-plus-zhang-long sewage ditch, which is a major base for mosquitoes and flies. When the masses filled this ditch, their enthusiasm was very high. They were divided into four small teams: weeding, scooping out mosquito larvae, digging the ditch, and filling the pond, working together to complete this work. Because Grandma Lu was old, everyone asked her to join the mosquito larvae scooping team. She refused, saying: "There are no old people in the new society." After saying that, she jumped down. Everyone else followed suit, even those who were hesitant because the mud pit was too dirty bravely went down. In a little over an hour, they cleared the sewage ditch that had been blocked for many years, turning the place where mosquitoes used to swarm into a place where you could sleep without a mosquito net. After many days, everyone learned that Grandma Lu had been working while sick during that ditch repair.

    In the Patriotic Health Campaign, the masses all understood that toilets should be at least ten zhang away from water wells; but there was a Yin family vegetable garden at Bianyingku, where the water well was right next to a cesspool. When the masses went to persuade the old man Yin, he said: "I'd rather eat 'peanuts' (bullets) than move it!" Everyone couldn't do anything about it, so they came back to discuss it with Grandma Lu. Grandma Lu patiently talked to the old Yin couple for two or three days, and the old man understood the principle; but he said he didn't have time to move it. Grandma Lu said: "As long as you are willing to move it, I will mobilize the masses to help you." So, the next morning, she brought twelve activists to work. Everyone worked together, and in a short while, all the manure was scooped out. But there was still manure soup left in the pit, and everyone was unwilling to go down to move the bricks. The old man Yin kept saying that there was a big vat under the pit, which must not be broken. In this situation, Grandma Lu jumped down first, standing in the half-person-high manure pit and started digging out the large bricks one by one. The masses were very moved, and two young men, Wang Shenghua and Tao Baiqiang, followed her down. The people above no longer minded the dirt and lined up to quickly pass the manure bricks, and as a result, more than 200 large bricks were moved out, filling in the cesspool. The old Yin couple later made wooden covers for dozens of cesspools in the vegetable garden because they didn't want Grandma Lu to worry and come to mobilize them again. The masses were also very grateful to Grandma Lu for this matter, because in the past they had to kill eighty or ninety thousand flies here every day, but later they only had to kill a few hundred.

    Now the phrase "Grandma Lu is here" has a special meaning in the Third District of Nanjing, that is, the masses have the confidence to overcome difficulties, or it is a symbol of overcoming difficulties. When Grandma Lu was elected as a national first-class health model to come to Beijing to participate in the Second National Health Conference, the masses sent her from the police station to the district people's government, and then to the municipal people's government. Many people entrusted her to bring letters to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing that they would do a good job in the Patriotic Health Campaign. Grandma Lu said: "I have done so little for the masses, and I have received such great glory and respect; but such a big movement cannot be done by one or two people. This glory was given by Chairman Mao and belongs to everyone!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    爱国卫生模范鲁大妈
    萧凤
    鲁大妈是一个平凡的有先进思想的老大娘。在爱国卫生运动中，她发动了一千四百多群众，清扫了十三个户口段，扫除了垃圾十九吨、水草十六吨半，捞孑孓四百斤，灭蛆二百斤，搬掉粪砖二百多块。另外，她自己还参加了三十一次义务突击劳动，灭蚊四万，捕蝇两万……。
    这位四十七岁的鲁大妈是革命军人家属，也是一个积极的街道工作者。她居住在南京市第三区剪子巷，那里是劳动人民聚居的地方。由于多少年来反动统治者的剥削与压迫，造成那一带环境卫生很差，居民普遍不讲卫生。爱国卫生运动刚刚开始的时候，一般居民是不大起劲的，他们认为“苍蝇自古就有，再也打不完”；有些妇女对打针还有着没根据的恐惧，往往一听说要打预防针便抱着孩子躲起来。鲁大妈知道爱国卫生运动的意义，更知道必须发动广大群众才能把运动搞起来的道理。因此，她首先把团结在自己周围的骨干分子组织起来，让他们都认识到“开展爱国卫生运动就是反对美帝国主义细菌战”的道理。由于鲁大妈三年来积极地替大家作事情，她在群众中有很高的威信。很快地就有一批积极分子和鲁大妈在一起开展这个工作。鲁大妈没有什么特殊的领导秘诀，她不强迫、不命令，只牢记住“骨干骨干，带头来干”八个字。她走到那里都是自己先下手作给群众看，帮助群众寻找工作方法。她说：“作群众工作光动嘴不行，动手作个样子是发动群众最有效的办法。”
    鲁大妈为了作群众的榜样，她在发动别人之前，首先彻底地作好了自己家里的清洁卫生工作。打狗，她就首先把自己的狗打掉；灭蛆，她首先到粪坑里去捞。有人说老鼠会算命，是没法抓住它的。她便先抓一只让大家看看；有人不相信老鼠身上有跳蚤，她便把一只老鼠放在细石灰盆里，让他看看落下来的黑点是什么东西。遇到思想搞不通的人，她就一遍两遍地说服。不愿动手搞卫生工作的人总爱强调他们有多少困难，但鲁大妈说：“困难，一克服就没有了。”有一个大杂院住了二十四户劳动人家，开始时一提起卫生工作大家都强调“没有工夫”。鲁大妈知道了这个情况，就带着打扫队来用实际行动说服他们，第一次不声不响地替他们扫出了一车半垃圾，第二次再扫出了一车，当第三次他们又去扫出半车垃圾的时候，那二十四家人感动得都拿起扫帚，拦住打扫队说：“你们这么扫，我们还说什么呢，鲁大妈！你们可不要再来了！卫生是大家的事，怎能老靠你们呢。我们保证把工作作好！”以后，他们果然把爱国卫生工作作得很好。
    鲁大妈在爱国卫生运动中不是等着工作来找她，而是整天东奔西跑，到处寻找工作对象。在她带头帮助八个户口段义务清扫了十六次以后，发现从武定门到雨花门之间铁道边的野草有一人多高。她就和群众商量，问他们应不应该把它拔掉。经过群众同意，这位老大娘便又夹在一群年轻人当中去征服那片野草了。那时还是夏天，劳动的人最需要喝水，鲁大妈一边拔草、一边还抽空给大家找开水喝；对有孩子或有家务牵累的妇女，她体贴得更加周到，到时就催着她们回去；她自己却坚持到最后。
    在鲁大妈居住的剪子巷里，有个三十多丈长的污水沟，那是个苍蝇蚊子丛生的大本营。群众在填这条沟的时候，情绪非常高。他们分成拔草、捞孑孓、掏沟和填塘四个小队，分工合作地来完成这个工作。大家因为鲁大妈年纪大了，让她参加捞孑孓队。她不肯，她说：“在新社会里没有年纪大的人。”说完话她就跳下去了。大家一见也都跟着纷纷跳下去，连那看着泥坑太脏有点踌躇的人，也勇敢地下去了。一个多钟头，他们就打通了淤塞多年的污水沟，把原来是蚊子扑人脸的地方，变成不要帐子能睡觉的地方。过了好些日子，大家才知道那次修沟的时候，鲁大妈是带病工作的。
    在爱国卫生运动中，群众都懂得了厕所要离水井至少十丈远；但是边营库上有个尹家菜园，水井的旁边紧挨着一个粪坑，群众去动员尹家老汉，他却说：“宁愿吃‘花生米’（子弹）也不搬开！”大家奈何他不得，便回来和鲁大妈研究。鲁大妈和尹家老俩口很耐心地谈了两三天，老头子懂得这个道理了；但是他说他没有时间搬。鲁大妈说：“只要你肯搬了，我动员群众来帮你作。”这样，第二天清早，她就带了十二个积极分子来工作了。大家一齐下手，一会儿就把粪都掏光了。可是坑里还留着粪汤，大家又不肯下去搬砖了。尹家老头还不住地说，坑底下有个大缸，无论如何不能打碎。在这种情况下，鲁大妈又首先跳下去了，站在半人高的粪坑里开始挖那一块块的大砖。群众非常感动，王声华和陶百强两个年轻人就也跟着下去了。上边的人也就不再嫌脏，排成一行迅速地传递起粪砖来，结果把两百多块大砖都搬了出来，填上了粪坑。尹家的老俩口以后把菜园里的几十个粪坑都作了木盖，因为他们不愿让鲁大妈再操心跑来动员了。群众对这事也很感激鲁大妈，因为过去他们每天要在这里打八九万只苍蝇，后来只打几百只了。
    现在“鲁大妈来啦”这句话，在南京市第三区有
    一个特别的意义，那就是群众有信心克服困难，或者说是克服困难的标志了。在鲁大妈当选为全国甲等卫生模范来北京参加第二届全国卫生会议的时候，群众把她从派出所送到区人民政府，又送到市人民政府。很多人托她给毛主席带来了保证把爱国卫生工作作好的信。鲁大妈说：“我给群众作这么一点点事情，就得到了这么大的光荣和尊敬；但这么大的一个运动一个人两个人是作不了什么的。这光荣是毛主席给的，是属于大家的！”（新华社）
