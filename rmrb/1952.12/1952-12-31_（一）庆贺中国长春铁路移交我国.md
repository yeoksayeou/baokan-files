    (I) Celebrating the Transfer of the China Changchun Railway to Our Country
    The ceremony for the transfer of the China Changchun Railway, jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, to our country is scheduled to be held today. This is yet another proof that the Soviet Union has remained steadfast in fulfilling its obligations under the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance; this is yet another proof that the brotherly, selfless assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, is immeasurable.
    According to the agreement between China and the Soviet Union on the China Changchun Railway, signed on February 14, 1950:
    "Both Contracting Parties agree that the Soviet Government shall transfer without compensation to the Government of the People's Republic of China all rights to the joint management of the China Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the said Railway. Such a transfer shall be effected immediately upon the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but not later than at the end of 1952."
    Representatives of the Chinese and Soviet governments also agreed in Beijing in April 1950 that the China Changchun Railway Company should be established from April 25, 1950, as an institution for the joint management of the railway by China and the Soviet Union before the transfer of the railway to China.
    The Sino-Soviet Communique on the Transfer of the China Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China on September 15 this year stated:
    "The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Government have already begun to take measures to implement the said agreement and have agreed to establish a Sino-Soviet Joint Commission for this purpose. The Sino-Soviet Joint Commission shall complete the transfer of the China Changchun Railway to the People's Republic of China before December 31, 1952."
    Now that the ceremony for the transfer of the China Changchun Railway to our country is scheduled to be held today, the above-mentioned agreements and announcements of the two governments on the transfer of the China Changchun Railway have been fully realized.
    The China Changchun Railway includes two major lines, one line from Manchuria on the Sino-Soviet border through Harbin to Suifenhe; the other from Harbin to Dalian. The total length of the railway in operation is more than 3,000 kilometers. This railway was originally built by Russia after 1896 and later occupied by Japanese imperialists. On August 15, 1945, the Soviet Red Army helped the Chinese people liberate Northeast China, and the China Changchun Railway was also liberated from the hands of Japanese imperialists. During the war, Japanese invaders and puppet troops had seriously damaged the railway. During the period of joint Sino-Soviet management, the Soviet Union used a large amount of manpower, material resources, and advanced technology to help our country actively repair and further build this railway.
    In the past three years, more than 1,000 Soviet experts from the China Changchun Railway, such as Comrades Yelogov, Grunichev, and Vasilyev, have selflessly trained nearly 20,000 railway management cadres and technicians for our country. National model workers Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, Yang Maolin, and female driver Tian Guiying were all personally trained by Soviet experts.
    Soviet comrades have taught us the advanced experience of the Soviet Union without reservation, and according to the specific conditions of our country, they have brought into play the creativity of our working class and created many advanced working methods. This is an immeasurably great help to our country's construction in all aspects. In the past three years, the China Changchun Railway has promoted more than 130 kinds of advanced Soviet experiences, and combined with the experience of our country's employees, it has created many new advanced working methods, playing a leading and exemplary role in the national railway system. These advanced and systematic experiences are extremely valuable not only for our people's railway management, but also for other enterprise management.
    Now, the Soviet comrades have built the China Changchun Railway well, cultivated talents, and taught us their experience. The Soviet government has transferred all the rights of this railway jointly managed by the two countries, as well as all the property belonging to this railway, to our country without compensation, and it is completely owned by our country. Such a selfless spirit cannot but be moving. The people of our country express their gratitude to the Soviet government and people, and to the Soviet experts working on the China Changchun Railway with boundless gratitude. Their great contribution to the railway construction of the Chinese people has become a brilliant symbol of the unbreakable friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union.
    This great and sincere cooperation between China and the Soviet Union not only represents the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also represents the interests of all peace-loving people in the world. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR":
    "The experience of this co-operation shows that no capitalist country could render such genuine and technically skilled assistance to the People's Democracies as the Soviet Union is rendering them. The point is not only that this assistance is the cheapest possible and technically the best. The chief point is that at the bottom of this co-operation lies a sincere desire to help one another and to achieve a common economic advance." The experience of the China Changchun Railway fully demonstrates this sincere desire of China and the Soviet Union.
    After the railway is completely taken over by our country, the responsibilities of all cadres and workers on the railway will be even greater. We must fully and skillfully master and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet railway, inherit the railway management and operation methods that the Soviet comrades have already established on the China Changchun Railway during the period of joint Sino-Soviet management, and carry them forward. We must systematically summarize all the precise methods of unified management, planned transportation, crew responsibility system, new road maintenance methods, station operations, and economic accounting system that are effective on the China Changchun Railway, and further promote them in all railways and other enterprises across the country.
    Starting in 1953, our country will implement the first five-year economic construction plan. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will increasingly increase its significance for our country's construction cause. We must never be satisfied with the incomplete and unsystematic state of learning from Soviet experience at present, and we must strive to change this situation. In this regard, the Chinese cadres and all personnel participating in the China Changchun Railway work must continue to pay attention, and must never have the slightest complacency. In the future, they must continue to maintain the spirit of humbly learning from the Soviet comrades in their joint work, do their work well, and manage the railway as well as it was managed during the period of joint Sino-Soviet management, and then build other railways in our country as well as the China Changchun Railway. We must use facts to prove to the Soviet comrades that we will never fail their lofty friendship.
    Let us warmly celebrate the transfer of the China Changchun Railway to our country, and let us warmly cheer the everlasting brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

### （一）庆贺中国长春铁路移交我国

    （一）庆贺中国长春铁路移交我国
    中苏两国共管的中国长春铁路移交我国的仪式，定于今日举行。这又一次证明了苏联对于中苏友好同盟互助条约所承担的义务是信守不渝的；这又一次证明了苏联政府和人民，在斯大林同志领导之下，对于我国所作的兄弟般的大公无私的援助，是不可估量的。
    依据一九五○年二月十四日中苏两国关于中国长春铁路的协定规定：
    “缔约国双方同意苏联政府将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府。此项移交，一俟对日和约缔结后立即实现，但不迟于一九五二年末。”
    中苏两国政府代表并于一九五○年四月间在北京议定：自一九五○年四月二十五日起，成立中国长春铁路公司，作为中苏两国在该路移交中国以前共同管理该路的机构。
    今年九月十五日中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告称：
    “中华人民共和国政府与苏联政府业已着手进
    行实现该项协定的措施，并为此目的已协议成立
    中苏联合委员会。中苏联合委员会应于一九五二
    年十二月三十一日前将中国长春铁路向中华人民
    共和国移交完毕。”
    现在中国长春铁路移交我国的仪式定在今天举行，上述两国政府关于移交中国长春铁路的协定和公告已经完满地实现了。
    中国长春铁路包括两大干线，一条干线是从中苏边境的满洲里经哈尔滨到绥芬河；另一条是由哈尔滨到大连。全路通车线路有三千多公里。这个铁路原是一八九六年以后俄国所建筑的，后来为日本帝国主义者所占据。一九四五年八月十五日，苏联红军帮助中国人民解放我国东北，中国长春铁路也从日本帝国主义者手中解放了出来。在战争中，日寇、伪军曾对该路进行了严重的破坏。在中苏共管的时期，苏联以大量的人力、物力和先进的技术，帮助我国积极修复和进一步建设这条铁路。
    在过去的三年间，中国长春铁路的苏联专家叶洛果夫、格鲁尼切夫、华西列也夫等一千多位同志，以忘我的精神为我国培养了近两万名的铁路管理干部和技术工人。全国著名的劳动模范郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林和女司机田桂英等，都是由苏联专家亲手培养出来的。
    苏联的同志们把苏联的先进经验毫无保留地教给了我们，并且根据我国的具体条件，发挥我国工人阶级的创造性，创造了许多先进的工作方法。这对于我国各方面的建设都是无比巨大的帮助。中国长春铁路在过去三年间，推广了苏联先进经验一百三十几种，并结合我国职工的经验，创造了许多新的先进工作法，在全国铁路中起了带头示范的作用。这些先进的、系统的经验，不仅对于我国人民的铁路管理，而且对于其他企业管理都是极其可贵的。
    现在，苏联的同志们把中国长春铁路建设好了，人才也培养出来了，经验也教给我们了，苏联政府又把两国共管的这条铁路的一切权利，以及属于这条铁路的全部财产，毫无代价地移交给我国，完全归我国所有。这样大公无私的精神不能不令人感动。我国人民以无限感激的心情，向苏联政府和人民致谢，向在中国长春铁路工作的苏联专家们致谢。他们对于中国人民铁路建设的重大功绩，已经成了中苏两大民族牢不可破的友好合作的一个光辉标志。
    中苏两国的这种伟大的真诚的合作，不仅代表了中苏两国人民的利益，而且代表了世界上一切爱好和平人民的利益。这正如斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”的著作中所指出的：
    “这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”中国长春铁路的经历，充分表现了中苏两国的这种真诚愿望。
    在这个铁路完全归我国接管以后，该路的全体干部和工人的责任就更加重大了。我们必须充分熟练地掌握和运用苏联铁路的先进经验，把中苏共管期间苏联同志们在中国长春铁路已经建立起来的铁路管理和经营的方法，很好地继承下来，并使它发扬光大。我们必须将所有在中国长春铁路行之有效的统一管理、计划运输、乘务负责制、新养路法、车站作业等科学制度和经济核算制的全部精密的方法，加以系统的总结，在全国各个铁路及其他企业中进一步推广起来。
    我国从一九五三年开始，就将实行第一个五年经济建设计划。学习苏联的先进经验，对于我国的建设事业将日益增加它的重大意义。我们决不能满足于现时学习苏联经验的不完整的、不系统的状况，必须努力改变这种状况。在这一方面，参加中国长春铁路工作的我国干部以及全体人员也必须继续注意，决不应该有丝毫自满的情绪，而必须在今后的时期，继续保持与苏联同志共同工作中的那种虚心学习的精神，把工作做好，把这条铁路管理得像在中苏共管的时期一样好，并进而把我国其他铁路也建设得像中国长春铁路一样好。我们要用事实向苏联同志们证明，我们是永不辜负他们的崇高友谊的。
    让我们热烈地庆贺中国长春铁路移交我国，让我们热烈地欢呼中苏两国兄弟般的友谊万岁！
