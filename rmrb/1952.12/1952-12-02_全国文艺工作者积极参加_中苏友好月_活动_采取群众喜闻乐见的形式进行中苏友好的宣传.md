Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Literary and art workers across the country, during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," have adopted forms popular with the masses to carry out propaganda, enabling the people of various regions to receive a vivid and concrete education in Sino-Soviet friendship.

    Fine arts workers have created many posters and placards to supply propaganda teams in various regions as propaganda materials. In Wuhan, more than sixty fine arts workers created five types of posters, such as "The Sino-Soviet Alliance is Invincible Under Heaven," printing more than 900,000 copies. They also painted many large-scale propaganda paintings and slogans, giving the streets of Wuhan a new look. In Xi'an, thirty-seven young painters worked for two days and two nights without rest to complete four large oil paintings, which were hung on the four walls of the Bell Tower in the city center, earning the praise of the audience. The Shanxi Provincial Art School created sixteen large-format paintings introducing advanced Soviet experiences in its propaganda activities. Musical workers led the broad masses of people to sing Sino-Soviet friendship songs such as "Moscow-Beijing" through various means. Cultural centers and literary and art federations in major cities in the Southwest region generally held music classes attended by hundreds of people. After learning the new songs, the students went deep into factories and residential areas to teach them. In newspapers across the country, almost every day, works by literary and art workers with Sino-Soviet friendship as the theme, as well as reviews of Soviet films and literary creations, were published. The Hangzhou "Zhejiang Literature and Art" magazine published a special "Sino-Soviet Friendship" issue during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month"; Wuhan's publishing houses also published a large number of popular books introducing the Soviet Union, with the Central South Worker's Publishing House alone publishing more than 80,000 copies of Hao Jianxiu's "What I Saw in the Soviet Union" and other books.

    Many literary and art workers combined with the masses to enrich the content of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" propaganda activities in various aspects, expanding the effect of propaganda and education. The Shanxi Provincial Art School, the Taiyuan Municipal Literary and Art Troupe, and two other units carried out propaganda through快板 (a type of rhythmic storytelling) "Bukov Helps with Huai River Management," comic dialogue "A Happy Life," and peep show "Leaning to One Side," educating a total of 200,000 people. Twenty-one troupes of five opera genres in Shanghai, including Yue Opera, Hu Opera, Yong (Ningbo) Opera, Huaiyang Opera, and Changxi Opera, performed short plays in major theaters to promote the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship. In the city's famous mass entertainment venues such as the Great World, a one-act play "When the Iron Bridge is Repaired" was added before the main play. This short play depicts the story of the Soviet expert Ivanov helping China build the Huai River Iron Bridge. When the sound of a train roaring was heard on the stage after the iron bridge was repaired, the audience cheered enthusiastically, deeply moved by the Soviet Union's sincere and selfless assistance to China. Many literary and art workers in Nanjing assisted people from all walks of life in carrying out Sino-Soviet friendship literary and art activities, holding six square literary and art conferences in the Sixth District alone, with more than 15,000 people attending. All the actors of the fourteen shadow puppet troupes in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, have drawn up a propaganda plan for the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," guaranteeing: wherever they perform, propaganda for Sino-Soviet friendship will be there. The Tibetan Women's Song and Dance Troupe of Xiahe County, Gansu Province, recently visited Linxia City in the province and performed wonderful song and dance programs such as "Ode to Stalin" and "Ode to Chairman Mao" to the citizens, receiving a warm welcome from the audience. All members of the Gui Sui Folk Artists Study Group created ditties such as "Li Shunda Visits the Soviet Union" and sang them in suburban rural areas, attracting more than 14,000 peasant audience members within three days. Seventy-two rural theater troupes in Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, toured various rural areas in the county performing Sino-Soviet friendship programs, with audiences reaching 160,000 in just six days. Most of the cadres of the Wuhan Literary and Art Federation went deep into factories to help workers create Sino-Soviet friendship literary and art works. So far, the workers have created more than ten works, including dramas and drum lyrics; some of the works have been published in the "Worker's Literature and Art" magazine.

    Literary and art workers in many cities have also exchanged work experience with Soviet artists, further promoting cultural ties between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Literary and art figures in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chongqing, Chengdu and other places have repeatedly invited Soviet artists who came to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" to hold symposiums. At these symposiums, which were full of brotherly friendship, literary and art workers from China and the Soviet Union introduced each other's literary and art work and exchanged views. The Chongqing Literary and Art Circles also presented the Guizhou Miao people's musical instrument "Lusheng" and recordings of folk songs from various parts of the Southwest to Zakharov, a member of the Soviet cultural workers delegation and secretary of the Soviet Composers Association. At these symposiums, Soviet friends warmly introduced their experience in accepting artistic heritage and creation, which is of great help to our current literary and artistic work. Literary and art workers in Xi'an, who had conducted symposiums with Soviet friends, are now working hard to learn from the experience of Soviet socialist art work to improve the ideological level of their creations.

    【新华社二日讯】全国文学艺术工作者在“中苏友好月”中采取群众喜闻乐见的形式，进行宣传，使各地人民受到生动而具体的中苏友好的教育。美术工作者们创作了很多宣传画和招贴画供给各地宣传队作为宣传材料。武汉市六十多个美术工作者创作了“中苏同盟无敌于天下”等五种招贴画，印行九十多万份。他们还绘制巨幅宣传画和标语等多幅，把武汉市街头装饰得焕然一新。西安市有三十七个青年画家两天两夜不休息来完成四幅巨幅油画，悬挂在市中心的钟楼四壁，受到观众的赞美。山西省艺术学校在宣传活动中绘制了十六幅介绍苏联先进经验的大排画。音乐工作者们通过各种方式领导广大人民群众歌唱“莫斯科—北京”等中苏友好歌曲。西南区各大中城市的文化馆和文学艺术界联合会，普遍举办了几百人参加的音乐班。学员们学会新歌曲后便深入到工厂、居民段去教唱。全国各地的报纸上，几乎每天都刊载着文艺工作者以中苏友好为主题的作品以及对苏联影片和文学创作的评介。杭州市“浙江文艺”杂志在“中苏友好月”中出版了“中苏友好”专号；武汉市各出版社还出版了大量介绍苏联的通俗读物，仅中南工人出版社就出版了郝建秀的“我看到的苏联”等读物八万多册。
    许多文艺工作者和群众结合，从各方面来丰富“中苏友好月”宣传活动的内容，扩大了宣传教育的效果。山西省艺术学校、太原市文艺工作团等三个单位，通过快板“布可夫帮助治淮”、相声“幸福的生活”、洋片“一边倒”等进行宣传，受到教育的群众共二十万人。上海市的越剧、沪剧、甬（宁波）剧、淮扬戏、常锡戏等五个剧种二十一个剧团，在各大戏院演出短剧，宣传中苏友好的伟大意义。全市著名的群众娱乐场所大世界等处，都在正戏之前加演独幕话剧“当铁桥修好的时候”。这个短剧表现了苏联专家伊凡诺夫帮助我国修建淮河铁桥的事迹。当铁桥修好舞台上传出火车吼叫声时，台下观众热烈欢呼，对苏联真诚无私地帮助我国极为感动。南京市很多文艺工作者，协助各界人民进行中苏友好的文艺活动，仅在第六区一个区就举办六次广场文艺大会，与会群众一万五千多人。青海省互助县十四副灯影戏班子的全部演员都订出“中苏友好月”的宣传计划，他们保证：在那里演出，中苏友好的宣传就到那里。甘肃省夏河县藏族妇女歌舞队最近曾访问该省临夏市，向市民演出“歌颂斯大林”、“歌颂毛主席”等精彩的歌舞节目，受到观众的热烈欢迎。归绥市民间艺人学习会全体成员创作“李顺达游苏联”等小调在郊区农村演唱，三天内农民观众有一万四千多人。江西省宁都县七十二个农村剧团在该县各农村巡回演出中苏友好节目，仅六天中观众即达十六万人。武汉市文学艺术界联合会的大部分干部深入工厂，帮助工人创作中苏友好的文艺作品。到目前为止，工人们已创作出戏剧、鼓词等十多件作品；有些作品已在“工人文艺”杂志上刊载。
    很多城市的文学艺术工作者还和苏联艺术家们交流了工作经验，进一步促进了中苏两国人民在文化上的联系。北京、上海、武汉、西安、重庆、成都等地的文学艺术界人士，曾多次邀请来我国参加
    “中苏友好月”的苏联艺术家举行座谈会。在这些充满着兄弟般的情谊的座谈会上，中苏两国的文学艺术工作者相互介绍了两国文学艺术工作的情况，并交换了意见。重庆市文学艺术界还把贵州苗族人民的乐器“芦笙”和西南各地民歌的录音胶带赠送给苏联文化工作者代表团团员、苏联作曲家协会书记查哈罗夫。苏联友人们在这些座谈会上热诚地介绍了他们接受艺术遗产和创作的经验，这对我国目前文学艺术工作有很大帮助。西安市曾经和苏联友人进行座谈的文艺工作者们，现在正努力学习苏联社会主义艺术工作的经验来提高创作的思想水平。
