    My Understanding of the Speed Reading Method for Russian Professional Books
    Wang Ziran
    I am a graduate of Tsinghua University this year. Not long after I started working in the Northeast, the leaders of the organization sent me to Tsinghua University to study the speed reading method for Russian professional books, preparing me to guide cadres' Russian studies in the future. I participated in Tsinghua's fourth speed learning session from beginning to end (from early October to late October), and I also participated in the work of the teaching and research group, so I have a relatively good understanding of the entire speed learning situation. Now, I would like to express a few opinions on the issue of speed learning.
    Regarding the basic factors of speed learning, people's opinions are inconsistent. For example, regarding the issue of foreign language foundation, some believe it is a necessary condition; others believe it has little effect on learning; some believe that although a foreign language foundation is not a necessary condition, it helps speed learning and can accelerate the learning progress if one has it. Experiments have shown that people with no foreign language foundation can also use the speed method to cultivate the ability to read Russian professional books, as long as they slightly extend the learning time and appropriately modify the teaching methods and materials. Of course, having a foreign language foundation helps speed learning, and this must also be affirmed. Regarding the issue of students concentrating on intensive study away from production, some believe it is a necessary condition, but based on our experience, although the intensive study method has many benefits for teaching, it is not a necessary condition if the leadership methods can be improved.
    It should be admitted that speed learning of Russian professional books is not easy. To achieve the purpose of speed learning, both teaching and learning sides must make great efforts and constantly improve teaching methods. I believe the following issues must be paid attention to in the teaching process.
    First, focus the students' attention and maintain full learning enthusiasm. This is the basic condition for speed learning. To achieve this, the leadership must provide students with a good learning environment (such as concentrating the learning location and freeing students from miscellaneous tasks). At the same time, it is necessary to conduct regular education to give students determination and confidence in learning. Tsinghua University has done a good job in this regard. For example, the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee personally studies various problems and promptly solves students' ideological problems, which has a very good effect. In addition, strengthening the tutoring system is also an effective way to improve students' learning confidence. Tutors should help students grasp the key points of learning, grasp the basic spirit of learning, and accept advanced learning methods, so as to avoid detours in learning, which can improve students' learning enthusiasm. For a few students with special difficulties and lack of confidence in learning, tutors should provide individual help to improve their learning confidence.
    Second, use concentrated methods to explain grammar, and conduct timely review and practice. This is also very important. In this speed learning session at Tsinghua University, the biggest feature of the grammar part is that the key points are prominent, clear, and clear, and students do not feel the intricate complexity of Russian grammar. Previously, many people who studied Russian were most troubled by noun declension, but Tsinghua University used the correspondence law of hard and soft vowels from three basic declensions, allowing students to deduce all declensions, so that only one table was used to solve the problem of noun declension. This teaching method makes it easy for students to understand and easy to remember, so many students feel "it's just like that" after learning grammar. This shows that Russian grammar is not that difficult to learn.
    During the learning process, many people worry that too little grammar is taught and that it is not enough. But the fact is not so. After the end of the speed learning session, many teachers at Tsinghua University translated part of the teaching materials; several professors have translated the entire book, and many teachers have prepared their own teaching materials with reference to Russian books. They did not encounter too much difficulty in grammar.
    Third, use the method of batch cyclical memory to intensively attack new words. We should make full use of this method in teaching. Previously, many people had poor reading ability even after studying Russian for a long time, because they remembered too few new words. Therefore, speed learning must adopt the method of intensively attacking new words. According to our experience, the best way is to use cards to recite new words in batches cyclically (from a few words to dozens of words), reciting each word once or twice before switching to the next new word. After one or two cycles, start memorizing (generally, first memorize the Chinese translation of the Russian new word). And classify the new words according to their difficulty, and concentrate on memorizing difficult new words (in batches), which is in line with the principle of "dispersing difficulties and concentrating on breakthroughs", so it can greatly improve the efficiency of students' memorizing new words. All students who use this method can remember 20 to 30 new words per hour at the beginning, and then increase to 60 to 70 new words per hour, and the highest efficiency is more than 100 new words in 40 minutes (including very few loanwords).
    The method of batch cyclical memory is completely in line with the experimental results in Soviet psychology, that is, memory is achieved by creating repeated impressions, and the interval of initial repetition should be short, and the subsequent interval should gradually increase. Soviet psychological experiments and our practice have proved that the method of repeating a new word many times and then remembering it is far less efficient than the cyclical memory method.
    Fourth, conduct regular reviews in conjunction with work. This is an effective way to consolidate the results of speed learning. Many people think that it is easy to forget so many new words in such a short period of time. But experience has proved that if we can persist in studying for one or two hours every day, reading on the one hand and reviewing new words on the other, we will not only not forget the new words, but also be able to increase our vocabulary, and the application of grammar will be more proficient, and the reading speed will also be improved. The key to the problem is whether you can persist in studying, and whether the administration can guarantee enough study time.
    I think the above four issues should be paid attention to in speed learning. In addition, there are two other issues that I would also like to share my opinions on.
    The first question is, after speed learning, can "one skill" (reading) be achieved to "four skills" (listening, speaking, reading, and writing)? The original purpose of speed learning is only for reading, and does not require the ability to write, listen, or speak. But I think mastering "one skill" is by no means limited to "reading". Because the basic elements of a language are vocabulary (single words, idioms, etc.) and grammar. In the process of speed learning, students have basic knowledge of both. For example, in grammar, they have mastered basic grammar; in single words, they have mastered the most commonly used thousand or so new words (in terms of engineering). To be able to listen, speak, and write, of course, it is necessary to greatly increase vocabulary (and the study of grammar does not require more supplementation) and constantly practice in practice. However, by mastering "one skill", we can independently and smoothly carry out reading, which creates extremely favorable conditions for increasing vocabulary and gradually skillfully applying grammar. Therefore, it is possible to gradually move from mastering "one skill" to "four skills".
    The second question is, is the speed reading method for Russian professional books applicable to the current general factory and mine workers (especially engineers and technicians)? I think it is applicable. This method is the most economical and effective learning method, and we can vigorously promote it, because the current work urgently requires cadres to be able to read Russian books and Russian reference materials, and does not urgently need to be able to speak, write, or listen.

    我对俄文专业书籍阅读速成法的认识
    王自然
    我是本年度的清华大学毕业生。我到东北工作不久，机关领导方面就派我到清华大学来学习俄文专业书籍阅读速成法，准备在将来让我指导干部的俄文学习。我和其他五个同志从头到尾参加了清华的第四次速成学习（自十月初到十月底），我本人并参加了教学研究组的工作，因而对整个速成学习的情况是比较了解的。现在，我想就速成学习问题，发表几点意见。
    关于速成学习的基本因素问题，人们的意见是不一致的。例如外国语文基础的问题，有人认为它是必要条件；有的人则认为它对于学习的作用很小；有些人以为，外国语文基础虽不是必需的条件，但如果具有外国语文基础，是有助于速成学习的，它可以加速学习的进度。实验证明，完全没有外国语文基础的人，同样可以用速成法培养阅读俄文专业书籍的能力，只要稍许延长学习时间，将教授法和教材加以适当修改。当然，有外国语文基础，是有助于速成学习的，这一点也必须肯定。关于学员脱离生产进行集中突击的问题，有人认为它是必要条件，但是根据我们的经验，集中突击的方式，对教学固然有许多好处，但如能改进领导方法，它也不是必需的条件。
    应该承认，俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习也不是轻而易举的。要达到速成学习的目的，教学双方必须作很大的努力，并不断改进教学方法。我认为下列几个问题是必须在教学过程中加以注意的。
    第一，使学员注意力集中，学习情绪饱满。这是速成学习的基本条件。要作到这种地步，领导方面须要给学员以良好的学习环境（如学习地点要集中，免除学员的杂务等），同时，必须经常进行教育，使学员对学习具有决心、信心。清华大学在这方面是做得比较好的，例如党委副书记亲自研究各种问题，并及时解决学员的思想问题，效果甚好。另外，加强辅导制度，也是提高学员学习信心的有效方法。辅导员要很好地帮助学员掌握学习重点，掌握学习的基本精神，并接受先进的学习方法，在学习中避免走弯路，这样才能提高学员的学习情绪。对少数有特殊困难、学习信心不足的学员，辅导员应给予个别帮助，以提高他们的学习信心。
    第二，采用集中的方法讲解文法，并及时进行复习和练习。这一点也是很重要的。清华大学在这次速成学习中，其文法部分的最大特点是重点突出，清楚明确，学员不感到俄文文法的错综复杂。以前许多学俄文的人对名词变格最感头痛，但清华大学却从三个基本变格，利用硬软母音对应律，使学员推想到所有的变格，这样只列一张表就把名词变格的问题解决了。这样的教学方法，使学员理解起来既容易，记忆起来也不困难，因而很多学员在学过文法以后都有“原来不过如此”的感觉。这说明俄文文法并不是那样难学的。
    在学习当中，很多人担心文法讲得太少、不够用。但事实却不然。清华大学许多教师在速成学习结束以后，曾翻译了一部分教材；有几位教授已译完了整本的书，有许多教师参考俄文书籍，准备了自己的教材。他们在文法方面没有碰到太大的困难。
    第三，用分批轮回记忆的方法，大量突击生词。我们在教学中应该充分地利用这一方法。以前有许多人在学了很长时间的俄文以后，阅读能力还是很差，原因就是生词记得太少。所以，速成学习就必须采用大量突击生字的办法，根据我们的经验，最好的办法就是用卡片分批地轮回地念生词（几个字到几十个字不等），每个字念一、二次后即换下一个生词，轮回一二次即开始背（一般是先记住俄文生词的中文译意）。并根据生词的难易，进行分类，集中力量记困难的生词（一批一批地记），这是合乎“分散难点，集中突击”的原则的，因此能够大大提高学员记忆生字的效率。凡是用这种方法的学员，在开始时，一小时可记二、三十个生词，随后每小时可增加到六十到七十个生词，效率最高的四十分钟内可记一百多个（其中极少外来语）。
    分批轮回记忆的方法，完全合乎苏联心理学中的实验结果，即记忆是靠造成重复的印象来达到的，而开始重复的间隔应短，以后的间隔应逐渐加长。苏联的心理学实验和我们的实践都证明，将一个生字重复多次再记住的方法，远不如轮回记忆法的效率高。
    第四，定期地结合业务进行复习。这是巩固速成学习成果的有效方法。很多人认为，在如此短的时间内记那么多的生词，一定很容易忘掉。但经验证明，如果我们每天能坚持一、二小时的学习，一面阅读，一面复习生字，就不但不会忘记生词，而且能够增识新的字汇，文法的运用也会更加熟练，阅读速度也会更加提高。问题的关键在于自己能否坚持学习，行政方面能否保证足够的学习时间。
    我认为，上面的四个问题，是应该在速成学习中加以注意的。另外，还有两个问题，我也想谈谈自己的意见。
    第一个问题，速成学习以后，能否由“一会”达到“四会”呢？速成学习的本来目的只是为了阅读，不要求能写、能听、能说。但我认为掌握“一会”的意义决不仅止于“阅读”。因为一种语文的基本要素就是词汇（单字、成语等）和文法。在速成学习的过程中，学员对这二者都有了基本的知识。例如在文法方面，他们掌握了基本文法；单字方面，他们则掌握了最常用的一千多个生词（工程方面的）。如果要达到能听、能说、能写，当然还必须大量增识词汇（文法的学习则不需更多地补充进行），并在实践中不断练习。但是，掌握了“一会”，我们就能独立地顺利地进行阅读，这就为增识字汇、逐步熟练地运用文法创造了极有利的条件。所以，从掌握“一会”再逐步走向“四会”，是可能的。
    第二个问题，俄文专业书籍阅读速成法，对于目前一般的厂矿和机关工作人员（特别是工程师、技师）是不是适用呢？我认为是适用的。这种方法是最经济最有效的学习方法，我们可以大力推广，因为目前的工作迫切需要干部能阅读俄文书籍及俄文参考材料，而并不急需能说、能写、能听。
