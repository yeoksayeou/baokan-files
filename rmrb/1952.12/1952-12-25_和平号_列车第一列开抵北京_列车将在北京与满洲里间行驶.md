Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 22nd—The first "Peace" train, rushed to completion by the Dalian Railway Factory, has been completed and arrived in Beijing on the 18th. This is a gift from the workers of the Dalian Railway Factory to the World Peace Congress held in Vienna.

　　The "Peace" train is streamlined. The two large silver characters "和平" (Peace), written by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, are inlaid on both sides of the rear of the train. Each compartment door of the sleeper car is inlaid with frosted glass with a dove of peace pattern. There are three "Peace" trains, each with seven carriages. Each includes one observation car with soft sleeper berths and three spare cars. All these vehicles are six-wheeled bogies with roller bearings, and are hauled by heavy locomotives with roller bearings, capable of traveling 90 to 100 kilometers per hour, with a maximum speed of 130 kilometers, half to one times faster than the current passenger trains. The interior is well-equipped, with each compartment having electric fans, colored lights, and heating. The observation car is even more exquisitely equipped, allowing passengers to enjoy the scenery from three directions, as well as read and hold meetings inside. Because the railway line between Beijing and Manchuria is increasingly becoming an important route for friendly exchanges between the people of our country and peace-loving people from all over the world, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has decided that the "Peace" train will run between Beijing and Manchuria.

　　The "Peace" train was successfully repaired and refitted by the workers of the Dalian Railway Factory from the "Asia" train, which the factory manufactured more than a decade ago. In order to rush the repair of the "Peace" train, the workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, and with the help of Soviet experts, overcame various technical and material difficulties, and finally completed the repair and refitting of the first train. They plan to complete the decoration of the second and third trains by the end of this year and the beginning of next year.

    “和平号”列车第一列开抵北京
    列车将在北京与满洲里间行驶
    【新华社大连二十二日电】大连铁路工厂赶修的“和平号”列车第一列已经完工，并在十八日开抵北京。这是大连铁路工厂职工对维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的献礼。
    “和平号”列车是流线型的。车尾两边镶着由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若写的两个银色大字——“和平”。每辆寝车的单间门上嵌的喷沙毛玻璃上都有和平鸽图样。“和平号”列车共有三列，每列七辆。其中各有软席卧铺的瞭望车一辆，预备车三辆。这些车辆全部是滚珠轴箱的六轮台车，用滚珠轴箱的重型机车牵引，每小时能走九十到一百公里，最高可以达到一百三十公里，比现行客车快一半到一倍。车内设备完善，每个单间都有电扇、色灯、暖气等设备。瞭望车的设备更加精美，旅客在车内可以从三个方面向外眺望风景，也可以在里面看书、开会。因北京、满洲里间的铁路线，已日益成为我国人民与世界各国爱好和平的人民间往来的要道，所以中央人民政府铁道部决定“和平号”列车就在北京和满洲里间行驶。
    “和平号”列车是大连铁路工厂的职工，把该厂在十几年前制造的“亚细亚号”列车修理和改装成功的。工人们为了赶修“和平号”列车，发挥了高度的劳动热忱，在苏联专家的帮助下克服了各种技术上和材料上的困难，终于完成了第一列列车的修理和改装工作，并计划在今年年底和明年年初完成第二列和第三列列车的装修工作。
