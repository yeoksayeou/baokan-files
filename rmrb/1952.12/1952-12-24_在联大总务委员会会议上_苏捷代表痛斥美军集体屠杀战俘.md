Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd: According to TASS, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at its meeting on the 21st, studied the request submitted by the Soviet delegation to urgently include the issue of the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by the American military authorities in the agenda of the Seventh General Assembly.

    Gromyko was the first to speak at the meeting. He emphasized that the issue raised by the Soviet delegation, from its nature and international significance, was urgent and important, and must be considered immediately before the adjournment of the current General Assembly. He presented facts proving the crime committed by the American military authorities on Pongam Island on December 14, 1952, and asked the committee to pay attention to a statement made by a representative of the US military command in Korea. According to newspaper reports, this representative was forced to admit that the Pongam Island POW camp incident was the most significant event, and its consequences were also the most serious.

    Gromyko then recounted the events of the barbaric massacre of POWs by the US military authorities in the Koje Island, Jeju Island, and Busan POW camps, events to which the Soviet delegation had previously asked the General Assembly to pay attention.

    Gromyko proved that the recent crimes of the American military authorities in Korea were a brazen violation of the universally recognized principles of international law regarding prisoners of war, and he could not and had no right to ignore such behavior.

    Gromyko explained the substance of the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation, which condemned the criminal acts of the American military authorities in Korea, and demanded that the US government take immediate measures to stop the massacre and severely punish those who committed these crimes. He said that the Soviet delegation firmly demanded that the issue it raised be studied before the adjournment of the current General Assembly.

    The next speaker, the American representative, unable to refute the facts of the atrocities committed by the US military in Korea, which were known to the world, promised to inform the committee of the actual situation of the Pongam Island incident later. He repeatedly stated that the American representative openly evaded discussing the substance of the issue. In a considerable part of his speech, he put forward some empty reasons and spoke some empty words, saying some things that are characteristic of American representatives in slandering the Soviet Union.

    The British representative, like his American counterpart, also expressed dissatisfaction with the convening of a special meeting of the General Committee and evaded discussing the substance of the issue.

    Gromyko spoke again. He said that the American representative was unable to refute the facts of the atrocities committed by the American military authorities in Korea, which are known to the world. Therefore, in order to divert the attention of the committee representatives and prevent them from discussing the substance of the Soviet proposal, he made up baseless fabrications.

    The representative of the Czechoslovak Republic, Vladimir Nosek, supported the Soviet delegation's request to immediately include the issue of the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the American military authorities on Pongam Island on the agenda of the current United Nations General Assembly, and firmly demanded that the United Nations General Assembly discuss this issue without delay. Nosek said that the American military authorities in Korea were trampling on the basic principles of humanity and human morality, brutally and collectively massacring unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were willing to return home. This fact added to the importance and urgency of discussing this issue. During the period from October 14 to December 14 of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, 321 prisoners were killed or injured in American prisoner of war camps. Nosek said that these facts were self-evident and not a propaganda as the American representative had fabricated here.

    Nosek then said that the people of the world demanded that the American military authorities immediately stop the bloody massacre of unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The United Nations General Assembly cannot ignore these urgent incidents of bloody massacres carried out by the American authorities in Korea. The United Nations General Assembly has a responsibility to discuss this issue as soon as possible and without delay. The Czechoslovak delegation believed that the United Nations General Assembly must condemn the cruel behavior of the American military authorities in Korea and demand that the US government take urgent measures to stop the American authorities from carrying out barbaric massacres of unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and punish the murderers in these crimes.

    The representatives of the committee—most of whom represented the United States' partners in the war of aggression against Korea—were unable to offer any reasons to oppose the Soviet proposal to include the issue of the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the American authorities on Pongam Island on the agenda of the General Assembly. Eleven representatives of the committee voted in favor of the Soviet proposal, and three representatives abstained (Argentina, Honduras, and the Kuomintang elements).

    The defenders and accomplices of the American aggression against Korea then resorted to tricks in an attempt to delay the discussion of this urgent and important issue, and changed its name, thereby reducing the importance of the Soviet proposal and casting doubt on the undeniable fact that the US military command in Korea had committed the brutal atrocity of massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    The Greek representative Kirou, who is known among UN personnel for bowing and scraping before the US State Department, spoke several times, suggesting that the motion submitted by the Soviet delegation be called the so-called collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by the American military authorities. Gromyko insisted on the Soviet formulation and proved that the Greek suggestion was completely untenable and the true meaning of this "amendment". Nevertheless, the General Committee decided to call the proposal an accusation of the collective massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Pongam Island by the American military authorities.

    After lengthy discussions, the majority of the committee had to agree to discuss the issue raised by the Soviet delegation immediately before the adjournment of the current General Assembly.

    World public opinion has expressed indignation at the atrocities of the US military in Korea. In the face of the indignation of world public opinion, the representatives of the US-British group of countries found it difficult to prevent the Soviet proposal from being included on the agenda of the General Assembly, and it was also difficult to postpone the discussion of this issue by the current General Assembly.

### 在联大总务委员会会议上  苏捷代表痛斥美军集体屠杀战俘

    在联大总务委员会会议上
    苏捷代表痛斥美军集体屠杀战俘
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会在二十一日的会议上研究了苏联代表团所提出的要求：火速把美国军事当局集体屠杀蜂岩岛上的朝鲜和中国战俘问题列入第七届大会议程。
    葛罗米柯在会上第一个发言。他强调指出：苏联代表团所提出的问题从它的性质与国际意义上看是紧急而重要的，必须在本届大会休会以前立即加以考虑。他提出事实证明一九五二年十二月十四日美国军事当局在蜂岩岛上犯下的罪行，并要求委员会注意朝鲜美军司令部的一个代表所发表的谈话。据报纸消息说，这个代表被迫承认蜂岩岛战俘营事件是最重大的事件，它的后果也是最严重的。
    葛罗米柯于是追述了巨济岛、济州岛与釜山战俘营美军当局野蛮屠杀战俘的事件，苏联代表团曾经要求大会注意这些事件。
    葛罗米柯证明：朝鲜美国军事当局最近的罪行是悍然破坏国际法中大家公认的关于战俘的原则的行为，他不能也没有权利忽视这种行为。
    葛罗米柯说明了苏联代表团所提出的提案的实质，这个提案谴责朝鲜美国军事当局的罪恶行为，并要求美国政府火速采取措施制止屠杀并严惩犯下这些罪行的人。他说，苏联代表团坚决要求在本届大会休会以前研究所提出的这个问题。
    下一个发言的美国代表，由于不能驳倒全世界都知道的朝鲜美军暴行的事实，答应以后把蜂岩岛事件的实际情况告诉委员会。他几次重复美国代表公然逃避讨论问题的实质。他在他的演说的相当大一部分中提出一些空洞的理由，讲了一些美国代表所特有的诬蔑苏联的话。
    英国代表和他的美国同行一样，也对召开总务委员会特别会议表示不满，并规避讨论问题的实质。
    葛罗米柯再次发言。他说，美国代表无法驳倒全世界都知道的美国军事当局在朝鲜干出的暴行的事实，因此，为了要转移委员会代表的注意力，使他们不讨论苏联提案的实质，便进行无中生有的捏造。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表乌拉季米尔·诺西克支持苏联代表团的要求：立刻把美国军事当局在蜂岩岛上集体屠杀朝中战俘的问题列入本届联合国大会的议程，并坚决要求联合国大会毫不迟延地讨论这个问题。诺西克说，美国军事当局在朝鲜正在践踏着人道和人类道德的基本原则，残暴地集体屠杀愿意回家的赤手空拳的朝中战俘，这个事实加重了讨论这个问题的重要性和紧急性，在联合国第七届大会从十月十四日到十二月十四日的开会期间，美国战俘营里有三百二十一个俘虏被打死或打伤了。诺西克说，这些事实都是不言自明的，并且不是像美国代表在此间所矢口捏造的那样是一种宣传。
    诺西克接着说，世界人民要求美国军事当局立即停止对赤手空拳的朝中战俘进行血腥的屠杀。联合国大会对于美国当局在朝鲜进行血腥屠杀的这些紧急事件不能置之不理。联合国大会有责任尽速并毫不迟延地讨论这个问题。捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为联合国大会必须谴责美国军事当局在朝鲜的这种残忍行为，并要求美国政府采取紧急措施制止美国当局对赤手空拳的朝中战俘进行野蛮的屠杀，并惩处这些罪行中的凶手。
    委员会代表——其中大多数代表着侵朝战争中的美国伙伴的国家——无法提出任何理由来反对把美国当局在蜂岩岛集体屠杀朝中战俘问题列入大会议程的苏联提案。委员会的十一个代表投票赞成苏联提案，三个代表弃权（阿根廷、洪都拉斯和国民党分子）。
    美国侵略朝鲜的辩护者和帮凶然后玩弄花样，企图延缓对这个迫切而重要的问题的讨论，并改变它的名称，从而缩小苏联提案的重要性，并使人怀疑朝鲜美军司令部犯下野蛮地屠杀朝中战俘的暴行的这个不容置辩的事实。
    在联合国人士中间以在美国国务院面前俯首贴耳闻名的希腊代表基鲁几次发言，建议把苏联代表团所提出的议案叫做所谓美国军事当局集体屠杀蜂岩岛朝鲜与中国战俘问题。葛罗米柯坚持苏联的提法，并证明了希腊建议完全站不住脚以及这个“修正案”的真正意义何在。尽管如此，总务委员会仍然决定把这个提案叫做对美国军事当局集体屠杀蜂岩岛朝中战俘的控诉。
    经过长久的讨论以后，委员会的多数不得不同意在本届大会休会以前立即讨论苏联代表团所提出的这个问题。
    全世界舆论都对朝鲜美国军方的暴行表示愤慨，在世界舆论的愤慨面前，美英集团国家的代表感到很难阻止把苏联提案列入大会议程，也很难使本届大会延期讨论这个问题。
