Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th -- The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company (referred to as Anshan Steel) has completed its annual national gross output value plan and exceeded its annual production increase and savings plan. As of the end of November, the total value of increased production and savings of Anshan Steel's factories and mines reached 1,393,500 tons of grain, exceeding the original full-year production increase and savings plan for this year by 65.32 percent. This achievement demonstrates that as long as production is not relaxed, it is still possible to do a good job in production even after a large number of personnel are transferred to basic construction departments.

On the basis of highly developing their patriotic and creative labor enthusiasm, the workers and staff of Anshan Steel's production factories and mines have consistently regarded learning and promoting advanced production experience, especially advanced Soviet experience, as an important method for completing the production increase and savings plan. At the beginning of the production increase and savings campaign, the production factories and mines transformed the process of formulating the production increase and savings plan into a process of "finding tricks" and learning and promoting advanced experience, thereby laying a solid ideological foundation for the subsequent sustained learning and promotion of advanced experience, which enabled the promotion of many key advanced production experiences.

Now, the workers and staff of Anshan Steel's production units are continuing to vigorously promote advanced production experience in order to strive to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 250,000 tons of grain for the country before the end of this year as a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country.

    鞍钢完成全年国家生产总值计划
    全年增产节约计划上月即已超额完成
    【新华社鞍山二十日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司（简称鞍钢）已完成全年国家生产总值计划，并超额完成全年增产节约计划。到十一月底为止，鞍钢各厂矿增产节约总值已达一百三十九万三千五百吨粮食，超过了原订的今年全年增产节约计划百分之六十五点三二。这一成绩说明，只要不放松生产，在抽调大批人员到基本建设部门后，仍然可以把生产搞好。
    鞍钢各生产厂矿职工在高度发挥爱国主义创造性劳动热情的基础上，一直是以学习和推广先进生产经验特别是苏联先进经验，作为完成增产节约计划的重要方法。增产节约运动一开始，各生产厂矿就把制订增产节约计划的过程变成“找窍门”、学习和推广先进经验的过程，从而为后来持久地学习和推广先进经验奠定了巩固的思想基础，因此使许多关键性的先进生产经验得到了推广。
    现在，鞍钢各生产单位的职工，正在继续大力推广先进生产经验，以便争取到今年年底以前再给国家增产节约价值二十五万吨粮食的财富，作为向中央人民政府毛主席和全国人民的新年献礼。
