Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th -- On November 30th, General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our side to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side against the barbaric act of again wounding 32 of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp on November 25th. The full text of the protest is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command:

On November 25th, your side again wounded 32 of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp. Regarding this, I lodge a serious protest with your side. It must be pointed out that in the two months of October and November alone, according to your side's public reports, your side has already killed and wounded 542 of our captured personnel. Your side violates all international law and humanitarian principles, and constantly uses force to brutalize prisoners of war in order to detain them. However, your side's spokespersons in the United Nations General Assembly use the absurd pretext of not using force to repatriate prisoners of war, insisting on destroying all international law and humanitarian principles, and forcibly detaining prisoners of war, making the Korean armistice, which is within reach, impossible to achieve. This fully proves that your side is determined to sabotage the armistice negotiations and prolong and expand the Korean War. Your side will never escape full responsibility for all these war crimes.

Chief Delegate: General Nam Il
November 30, 1952

On the same day, at the meeting of liaison officers of both sides, our liaison officer raised with the other side that at around 3:40 a.m. on November 26th, U.S. military aircraft bombed the vicinity of Jiangdong Branch Camp of our No. 11 POW Camp, damaging four places in the POW camp buildings, and requested the other side to pay serious attention to this. Our liaison officer pointed out that the repetition of such incidents will have serious consequences.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st -- According to U.S. announcements, on November 25th, another 32 of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp were wounded by the U.S. side. To date, in November alone, according to U.S. disclosures, a total of three of our captured personnel have been killed and 53 wounded. This is obviously only a very incomplete figure, because the facts have already proven that the U.S. side even frequently conceals some major collective massacre events by means of news blockades. For example, the U.S.'s pet organization, the "International Committee of the Red Cross," in its so-called POW camp "inspection" report to whitewash U.S. war crimes, revealed the serious events of the U.S. side killing and wounding 784 prisoners of war last December and killing and wounding 93 prisoners of war last August, all of which the U.S. side had never published.

When disclosing the incident of November 25th, the U.S. side, as usual, fabricated excuses, saying that the incident was caused by the prisoners of war "attacking" the American troops. Who can believe that unarmed prisoners of war would "attack" American troops armed to the teeth for no reason? In fact, the continuous killing of prisoners of war in U.S. POW camps, even its pet organization, the "International Committee of the Red Cross," has had to admit "is the result of the prisoner of war authorities' serious prejudice." In other words, it is the result of the U.S. side's insistence on using force to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

    南日将军抗议美方又打伤我大批被俘人员
    我联络官要对方注意美机轰炸我方战俘营江东分营事件
    【新华社开城三十日电】十一月三十日，朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军，对美方在十一月二十五日又一次在巨济岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员三十二人的野蛮行为，向对方提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    十一月二十五日，你方在巨济岛战俘营又打伤我方被俘人员三十二人。对此，我向你方提出严重抗议。必须指出，十月和十一月两个月内，仅就你方公开报道，你方已打死打伤我方被俘人员五百四十二人。你方违反一切国际公法与人道原则，不断使用武力摧残战俘，以便扣留他们，但你方在联合国大会的发言人却以不得使用武力遣返战俘的无稽之谈为藉口，坚持破坏一切国际公法与人道原则，强迫扣留战俘，使举手可及的朝鲜停战不能实现，这就完全证明了你方决意破坏停战谈判，延长并扩大朝鲜战争。你方将永远不能逃脱对这一切战争罪行的完全责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
    首席代表　南日将军
    一九五二年十一月三十日
    同日双方联络官会议上，我方联络官向对方提出十一月二十六日上午三时四十分左右，美方军用飞机轰炸我方第十一号战俘营江东分营的周围，损坏战俘营建筑物四处，要求对方予以严重注意。我方联络官指出，这类事件的重复，将产生严重的后果。
    【新华社开城一日电】据美方宣布：十一月二十五日在巨济岛战俘营内又有我方被俘人员三十二名被美方打伤。至此，在十一月份内，仅据美方透露，就已共害死我方被俘人员三名，打伤五十三名，这显然只是一个极不完全的数字，因为事实已经证明：美方甚至经常把一些重大的集体屠杀事件，用新闻封锁的办法隐瞒起来。例如美方的御用组织“红十字国际委员会”，在它的为美方洗刷战争罪行的所谓战俘营“视察”报告书中，就泄露美方在去年十二月打死打伤战俘七百八十四名，和在去年八月打死打伤战俘九十三名的严重事件，而这些事件都是美方未曾发表过的。
    美方在透露十一月二十五日的事件时，照例杜撰藉口，说事件是由于战俘“攻击”美国军队所引起的。谁能相信赤手空拳的战俘会无故地去“攻击”武装到牙齿的美国军队？事实上，美方战俘营中不断屠杀战俘的事件，连其御用组织“红十字国际委员会”也已经不得不承认“是由于战俘当局严重的偏执的结果”，换句话说，就是美方执意要用武力强迫扣留战俘的结果。
