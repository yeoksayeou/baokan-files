Original Data is the Foundation of Design
Li Li, Deputy Director of the Design Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

I. Without Correct Original Data, Design is Impossible

Collecting original data is the most important part of the design preparation work.

Many people do not understand the dependence of design on original data. They think that they can sit in a house and design out of thin air, and that they can carry out calculation work by being divorced from the actual situation. This is extremely wrong. Because without resource surveys, it is impossible to determine the factory site and production operation methods; without investigation of ground conditions, it is impossible to arrange the overall layout and decide how to transform and utilize the existing factory site and equipment; without the original data of water supply, electricity, gas, instrumentation, heating, ventilation, transportation, climate, hydrology, topographic foundation, equipment, compressed air, metal structure, raw material conditions, geological conditions, operation conditions, product quantity and quality, it is impossible to organically link these elements together in the design process. The scale, scope, and depth of original data collection not only determine the technical content of the design, but also determine the economic content of the design, and thus also determine the political value of the design.

For larger-scale designs, the required original data cannot be completed by short-term crash programs. It should be said that the knowledge required for design is also needed when collecting original data. Because the methods and content of original data collection are carried out under the guidance of design thinking, and it is a part of the entire design thinking. Because we have just started large-scale capital construction, even the most basic and necessary data needs to be started from scratch; and the collection of many data, such as meteorological, rainfall, and river flow surveys, cannot be completed without a long period of time. At present, our geological, surveying and mapping forces are still very insufficient. If we do not start investigating and collecting as soon as possible, we will not be able to obtain timely original data on resource conditions, engineering geological conditions, general layout plans, and other detailed information on equipment and buildings; without these, design cannot begin. Therefore, we must make a long-term specific plan for collecting original data, and we must equip a technical force that can meet the requirements in terms of quantity and quality in order to complete the task.

II. Existing Problems in Collecting Original Design Data

According to experience, the original data required for a relatively large preliminary design should be submitted one year before the preliminary design is submitted; the original data for technical design needs to be submitted one year and six months before construction, respectively, according to the sequence of construction. Otherwise, it will not be possible to ensure the smooth progress of the design. However, the current situation of supplying original data is still far from this requirement.

The original data cannot be completed on schedule, roughly in the following three situations:

(1) The work of collecting original design data is arranged too late; (2) The speed of completion of various design data is unbalanced, and the completed parts cannot exert their effectiveness because the other parts have not been completed; (3) The collection of basic data is slow. Some data must be made after other data are available, but if the basic data is not completed in time, the production of data will be affected.

Another problem currently existing in the collection of original data is that the quality is not high and there are many errors. This is reflected in the following aspects:

(1) Arbitrarily use old maps as actual measurement maps. We have checked a part of old maps, and only a small number of them can truly reflect the current actual situation. Some maps not only have errors in the invisible parts buried underground, but also have errors in the position of the overall layout on the ground. As for methodological errors, they can often be encountered. The reason why old maps cannot represent the actual situation is that some surveyors were originally unable to make the maps consistent with the actual objects; some factories carried out new constructions after the maps were made; some original design drawings could not be realized due to some relationship, but the drawings were preserved. People who use old maps are deceived because of their lack of experience. Now our strength in collecting original data is still very weak, and the need is very urgent, so various departments are accustomed to using old maps to cope with tasks.

(2) The total dimensions and partial dimensions on a map cannot match. This is originally a common method to check whether the map is accurate, but because most of the people who collect data are inexperienced technicians, they do not know how to use this method to check their products. Some of them understand it, but they are not responsible and simply abandon it.

(3) The maps and data made successively contradict each other, making designers not know which data is correct. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that the operation methods are different, the collectors are frequently replaced, and there is no clear technical summary and handover system in the work.

(4) The general map and the sub-maps do not match, the sub-maps cannot be merged into the general map, and the same parts shown on the general map and the sub-maps contradict each other. This is mainly caused by the surveyor's poor working methods and lack of inspection.

(5) The indication of the same object is inconsistent among various types of maps. For example, the standard height of a house is one number on the general plan and another number on the sub-map, and the difference has been found to be as large as fifty meters. If designed based on this, I really don't know where it will go wrong!

As for the phenomena of inconsistent surveying methods and irresponsibility, errors in drawing, translation, and collation, and various shortcomings and errors caused by the lack of contact and exchange of opinions between parallel operating units, are almost universal.

In short, all these shortcomings and errors can be attributed to one point: that the data cannot explain the actual situation. As a result, the design is divorced from the actual situation, leading the design in the wrong direction, and causing the design not to be completed at one time, and being forced to make repeated modifications during construction. For example, in a certain project, a 60-meter-high chimney was mistaken for 40 meters when collecting original data; because the chimney was reported 20 meters lower, according to the designer's calculations, the old one must be demolished and a new one built, and the flue, foundation, and various pipelines need to be changed in design; only later was it discovered that the original data was wrong. This small example fully illustrates the importance of original data for design. A small error in the original data will result in a large error in the design. If this error cannot be discovered before construction, it will inevitably cause waste and rework during construction. Therefore, our requirements for the quality of original data should be very strict.

The reason why original data is not submitted in time and the quality is low is mainly that we lack a high sense of responsibility for the country's construction cause, we do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of original data in design work, and we underestimate its difficulty; therefore, we have failed to arrange this work early and more systematically, we have not equipped enough technical force, there is no strict system, and the necessary instruments and equipment in the work have not been supplied in time. The factories and mines use the excuse that the production tasks are busy and do not give enough help to the surveyors. In this way, the phenomenon of coping with tasks by misusing old maps and the phenomenon of sloppiness in operation cannot be avoided.

III. How to Solve the Problems

(1) First of all, it is necessary to conduct ideological education on the collection of original data, so that our cadres who lead the design understand the significance of original data for design, and enable them to give necessary attention to equipping technical forces, strengthening technical management, adding necessary equipment and instruments, and organizing testing agencies to serve this work. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of technical personnel. Nowadays, design technicians generally pay attention to product balance, overall layout, technical calculation and theoretical learning in design, but they underestimate on-site actual measurement, resource investigation and other work. They mistakenly believe that this is a low-level job and can be entrusted to "unimportant people". They do not think about how to be responsible for the quality and speed of the design, but only focus on enriching their own "capital" in the design work. With this kind of personal plan, the technical problems that could have been solved cannot be solved, and the techniques that could have been quickly mastered through learning have not been mastered for a long time. Therefore, ideological construction among design personnel is the central link in strengthening the collection of original data.

(2) The responsible organization for overall design must grasp the entire work plan for collecting original data. At present, many factories, mines and institutions are collecting original design data in parallel and without contact with each other, and these parallel work units lack unified leadership. This method brings many difficulties to the work, it promotes blind spontaneity, makes technical standards unable to be unified, mutual progress cannot be coordinated, general data and sub-data, general maps and sub-maps cannot match, making data maps out of touch with the actual situation. Therefore, unified leadership is very necessary. This unified leading organization should complete the following tasks: 1. According to the intention of the overall design, determine the scope and depth of collecting original data. 2. According to the length of time required for design data and the urgency of needs, determine the work progress and the start time. 3. Determine unified technical standards. 4. Grasp the changes of the design object in the design process, so as to modify the collected original data at any time according to the actual changes. 5. At any time, give technical and work guidance to the scattered parallel units that collect original data. 6. It is necessary to combine the technical data of various professions (such as electricity, water, transportation, etc.) and their relationship on the plane of different factories and mines, otherwise it is impossible not to make mistakes. 7. Be responsible for solving the specific difficulties in collecting data.

(3) Establish a responsibility system for collecting original data and overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible. The errors and shortcomings in the design work certainly have certain objective difficulties, but the lack of dedicated personnel in charge has indeed contributed to the development of these errors. To this end, the following responsibility systems should be established:

1. It is necessary to unify the leadership of the original data work of the entire project. The person who assumes this responsibility should be the chief person in charge of the engineering design. Because only this person in charge can know what data is needed for the design and when the data should be submitted.

2. The responsibility system for the original data required for various industrial operation designs. Taking a comprehensive steelmaking plant as an example, these industrial sectors should include mining, mineral processing, ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, chemical industry, refractory materials, and repair shops. For the data of each department, an engineering and technical personnel should be specially assigned to be in charge of it, and he should be responsible for the quality and speed of the work.

3. The responsibility system for the original data required for various professional designs. Generally speaking, it should include: electricity, water supply, gas, heating, ventilation, instrumentation, heating, geology, foundation, metal structure, transportation, and general layout. Each business department should also assign an engineering and technical personnel to be in charge of it.

4. The responsibility system for collecting data and on-site actual measurement. The purpose is to enable the textual and surveying and mapping personnel of the original data to ensure that the data and drawings they collect are completely consistent with the actual situation on the site. When using existing data and drawings, they should conduct verification and re-measurement.

5. Technical review responsibility system. Because the scope of original data is too wide and the number of people needed is large, and it is impossible to take all the strongest technical forces to do the original surveying and mapping work; therefore, it is often not easy to find out the problems in the data only by relying on the responsibility system of the original practitioners, and it is necessary to add the technical review responsibility system for each industrial operation design data and professional design data.

6. Establish a responsibility system for drawing, copying, and translation. After the drawing, copying, and translation work is completed, a review system must be established within their own department.

7. Responsibility system for general layout management. After the original data collection is completed, the situation of the factory and mine is often changed; therefore, a general factory with reconstruction or new construction must establish a management responsibility system for the general layout. Its task is to review and approve the reconstruction plans proposed by various factories and mines in various aspects, and ensure that these plans do not violate the overall design; on the other hand, it is necessary to notify the design unit of these reconstruction plans, so that the design unit can consider the design layout according to the new situation.

IV. Conduct Review Work

Due to our lack of experience in the past, as well as subjective negligence and errors, many errors have been caused in the work of collecting original data, such as allowing them to continue to exist, it will inevitably cause errors in the design (in fact, it has already caused); therefore, it is very necessary to conduct a general review of the data collected in the past. If errors are found, re-measurement should be carried out for confirmation; if the existing drawings of factories and mines that have been put into use in the past have not been actually measured, they should be re-measured and verified. If errors are found in the review, the design agency should be notified in addition to correcting them. Another task of the review is to check for omissions.

V. Train Technical Forces for Collecting Original Design Data

Now the collection of original data is generally the responsibility of the design department, and only a small number are collected by the factories and mines themselves. The advantage of the design agency taking on this task is that the original data can be coordinated with the design intention, but its disadvantage is that it disperses the design force, and because the design agency does not have enough understanding of the specific situation of the factory and mine, it often encounters difficulties in reviewing the data, even if it can do the review of the drawings, it cannot guarantee that the drawings are consistent with the actual situation. In the Soviet design work, the work of collecting original data is carried out by the design department putting forward requirements and the date of completion, the factory and mine providing the ground and operation data, and the specialized geological surveying, meteorological, and hydrological agencies taking on this work. We should also gradually learn from the Soviet Union's experience, cultivate the ability of factories and mines to collect data independently under the guidance of the design agency, and strengthen the forces of geological surveying, meteorological, and hydrological agencies to create conditions for the country's large-scale construction.

    原始资料是设计的基础
    鞍山钢铁公司设计处副处长　李力
    一、没有正确的原始资料，便不可能进行设计
    搜集原始资料是设计准备工作最主要的一个环节。
    设计对于原始资料的依赖性，很多人是不了解的。他们以为可以坐在房子里凭空地进行设计，可以脱离实际情况来进行计算工作。这是极端错误的。因为没有资源调查，便不可能决定厂址和生产操作方法；没有地面情况的调查，便不可能布置全局，并决定如何改造与利用现有的厂址和设备；没有水道、电气、煤气、计器、采暖、通风、交通、气候、水文、地形基础、设备、压缩空气、金属结构、原料情况、地质情况、操作情况、产品数量和质量的原始资料，便不可能在设计过程中把这些要素有机地联系起来。原始资料搜集的规模、范围和深度，不仅决定着设计的技术内容，而且也决定着设计的经济内容，因而也决定着设计的政治价值。
    规模较大的设计，其所需要的原始资料不是短期的突击可以完成的，应当说，设计上所需要的知识，在搜集原始资料时也同样需要。因为原始资料搜集的方法和内容，是在设计思想指导之下进行的，而它就是全部设计思想的一部分。由于我们刚刚开始大规模的基本建设，所以连起码的必要的资料都需要从头做起；而且有许多资料的搜集，例如气象、雨量、河流流量等调查工作，没有较长的时间是不能完成的。目前，我们地质、测量测绘的力量还十分不足，如果不及早下手调查搜集，便不能及时地得到资源情况、工程地质情况、总平面图，以及其他有关的设备和建筑物的详细情况的原始资料；而没有这些，设计是没有办法开始的。因此，我们必须做出长期搜集原始资料的具体计划，并且必须配备数量上质量上都能满足要求的技术力量才能完成任务。
    二、目前在搜集设计原始资料中存在的问题
    根据经验，规模比较大的初步设计所需的原始资料，应在交出初步设计一年前全部提出；技术设计的原始资料，需要按施工的次序分别在一年和半年前提出。否则便不能保证设计顺利地进行。但是，我们目前供给原始资料的情况离这个要求还很远。
    原始资料不能按期完成，大致有下述三种情况：
    （1）搜集设计原始资料的工作布置得过晚；（2）各种设计资料完成的速度不平衡，完成的部分由于另外的部分没有完成而不能发挥使用效能；（3）基础资料的收集工作迟缓。有些资料是必须有了其他资料才能开始制做，但如果作为基础的资料没有及时完成，资料的制做便会受到影响。
    在搜集原始资料上，目前存在着的另一个问题是质量不高、错误繁多。这表现在以下几方面：
    （1）随意利用旧图充作实测图。我们曾检查过一部分旧图，其中能够真实反映现在实际情况的为数甚少。有的图中不仅对埋在地下的隐见部分有错误，而且地面上的总布置在位置上也有错误。至于方法上的错误则是经常可以碰到的。旧图不能代表实际情况的原因，有的是测绘者原来就没有能够使图纸与实物一致；有的是图制好后工厂进行了新的修建；有的是原来设计图样因为某种关系没有能够付诸实现，但图纸却保存了下来。利用旧图的人，由于缺乏经验，便上了当。现在我们搜集原始资料的力量还很薄弱，而需要又很急，因此各部门习惯于用旧图来应付任务。
    （2）一张图面上的总尺寸和分尺寸不能吻合。这本来是检查图纸是否准确的一个普通方法，但是由于搜集资料的人多是些缺乏经验的技术人员，不懂得用这个方法来检查自己的制品。有的虽然懂得，但责任心不强，竟弃而不用。
    （3）先后制做的图纸和资料互相矛盾，使设计人员不知道哪一个资料是正确的。形成这种现象的原因，主要是操作方法不同，搜集的人员经常调换，工作中没有明确的技术总结和移交制度。
    （4）总图和分图对不起来，各分图不能合并成总图，总图和分图上所表现的同一部位互相矛盾。这主要是测绘者工作方法不好和缺乏检查所造成
    的。
    （5）各种性质不同的图纸之间，对同一实物的标示不一致。比如房屋的标准高度，在总平面图上是一个数，在分图上又是另外一个数，相差的数目已发现有大到五十公尺的。如果据以设计，真不知要错到哪里去了！
    至于测绘方法不统一和不负责任的现象，描图、翻译、整编上的错误，各个平行作业单位之间互相不联系、不交换意见而引起的各种缺点和错误，几乎是普遍的。
    总之，这一切缺点和错误，都可以归结到一点上来：即资料不能说明实际情况。而其结果则是使设计脱离实际情况，把设计引导到错误的方向去，而且造成设计不能一次完工，被迫在施工中作再三再四的修改。例如在某工程中，有一个六十公尺高的烟囱，在搜集原始资料时被误为四十公尺；又因烟囱低报了二十公尺，根据设计者的计算，必须拆掉旧的，另建新的，烟道、基础、各种道管都需要改变设计；到后来才发现是原始资料错误。这一个小例子就充分说明了原始资料对于设计的重要。原始资料有一点小的错误，其结果就要造成设计上很大的错误。如果这种错误不能在施工前发现，必将在施工中造成浪费和返工。因此，我们对原始资料质量的要求应当是十分严格的。
    原始资料所以提交不及时而且质量低劣，主要是我们对国家建设事业缺乏高度负责的精神，对原始资料在设计工作中的重要意义认识不够，过低地估计了它的艰巨性；因此未能及早地、更有计划地来布置这一工作，没有配备足够的技术力量，没有严格的制度，工作中必要的仪器和设备也未能及时供给，生产的厂矿藉口生产任务忙，不给实测人员以足够的帮助。这样，工作中滥用旧图的应付现象和作业中的草率现象就无法避免。
    三、问题如何解决
    （1）首先必须进行关于搜集原始资料的思想教育，使我们领导设计的干部懂得原始资料对于设计的意义，使他们在配备技术力量、加强技术管理、增添必要的设备和仪器、组织化验机关为这一工作服务等方面给予必要的重视。另一方面，还必须加强对技术人员的教育。现在设计技术人员一般都重视设计中产品的平衡、总体的布置、技术的计算和理论的学习，而轻视现场的实测、资源的调查等工作，他们错误地认为这是低级的工作，可以委给
    “不重要的人物”去做。他们不想如何对设计的质量和速度负责，而一味地注意在设计工作中充实自己的“本钱”。有着这种个人打算，便使原来可以解决的技术问题不能得到解决，原来可以经过学习迅速掌握的技术长期没有掌握。所以说目前在设计人员中进行思想建设，是加强搜集原始资料工作的中心一环。
    （2）必须由总体设计的负责机关掌握整个搜集原始资料的工作计划。目前我们许多厂矿和机构都平行地、互不联系地搜集设计的原始资料，而这些平行的工作单位又缺乏统一的领导。这种办法给工作带来了许多困难，它助长了盲目的自发性，使技术标准不能统一，相互间的进度不能配合，总资料和分资料、总图和分图不能吻合，使得资料图纸与实际情况脱节。因此，统一领导是十分必要的。这种统一的领导机构，应当完成下列的工作任务：1、根据总体设计的意图，决定搜集原始资料的范围和深度。2、根据设计资料的费时长短、需要的急缓，决定工作进度和开始的时间。3、确定统一的技术标准。4、掌握设计对象在设计过程中的变化，以便随时根据实际的变化，来修改已经搜集的原始资料。5、随时给分散的平行的搜集原始资料的单位以技术上、工作上的指导。6、必须把各个专业的技术资料（如电力、水道、交通运输等）和它们在不同的厂矿的平面上的关系统一起来，否则便不可能不发生错误。7、负责解决搜集资料中的具体困难。
    （3）建立搜集原始资料的责任制，克服无人负责的现象。设计工作中的错误和缺点，固然有一定的客观困难，但无专人负责确实也助长了这些错误的发展。为此，应当建立如下几项负责制：
    1、必须统一领导整个工程的原始资料工作。担负这个责任的应当是工程设计的总负责人。因为只有这个负责人才能知道设计需要什么资料，什么资料什么时候提出。
    2、各个产业操作设计所需要的原始资料的负责制。拿一个综合的炼钢厂来说，这些产业部门应包括采矿、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、化工、耐火、修理厂等。每一个部门的资料，都应当专门委派一个工程技术人员专司其事，责成他对工作的质量和速度全部负责。
    3、各个专业的设计所需要的原始资料的负责制。一般地说，它应当包括：电力、水道、煤气、加热、通风、计器、采暖、地质、基础、金属结构、运输及总平面图等方面。每一个业务部门同样也应当指派一个工程技术人员专司其事。
    4、搜集资料和现场实测的负责制。目的是为了使原始资料的文字和测绘的从业人员，保证自己搜集的资料和图纸与现场的实况完全一致。在利用旧存的资料和图纸时，他们要进行对证和复测。
    5、技术审核责任制。由于原始资料的范围太广，需要的人数众多，而又不可能把现在的全部最强的技术力量拿来做原始测绘工作；因而仅凭原始从业人员的负责制，往往不易查出资料中的毛病，还必须增设每个产业操作设计资料和专业设计资料的技术审核责任制。
    6、建立描图、复写、翻译的责任制。在描图、复写、翻译工作完结之后，在自己部门内部，又必须建立复审制度。
    7、总平面图管理的责任制。原始资料搜集完结之后，厂矿的情况往往是有变动的；因此一个改建或新建的综合工厂，必须建立总平面图的管理负责制。它的任务一方面是审查与批准各厂矿所提出的各方面的改建计划，并保证这些计划不与总体设计相违背；另一方面则要将这些改建计划通知设计单位，以便设计单位根据新的情况来考虑设计布置。
    四、进行复查工作
    由于我们以往没有经验，以及主观上的疏忽和错误，因而在搜集原始资料的工作上造成了许多错误，如任其继续存在，必然造成设计方面的错误（事实上现在也已经造成）；因此把以往搜集的资料来一次总审查，是十分必要的。如果发现错误，应进行复测确认；以往已经启用的厂矿旧存图纸，如未进行实测者，应重新实测对证。在复查中发现错误，除改正外，应通知设计机关。复查的另一项工作任务是检查有无遗漏。
    五、培养搜集设计原始资料的技术力量
    现在搜集原始资料，一般地都是由设计部门负责，而各个厂矿自行搜集的只是很少数。由设计机关来担任这个任务，其好处能使原始资料与设计的意图相配合，但其缺点是分散设计力量，而且设计机关由于对厂矿具体情况了解不够，故在审核资料上常常碰到困难，即使能做到图面的审查，但是并不能保证图面和实际情况的一致。苏联设计工作中搜集原始资料的工作是由设计部门提出要求和完成的日期，由厂矿提出地面和作业资料，由专门地质测量、气象、水文机关来担任这项工作。我们也应逐渐地学习苏联的经验，培养厂矿的在设计机关指导下自行搜集资料的力量，壮大地质测量、气象、水文机关的力量，为国家的大规模建设创造条件。
