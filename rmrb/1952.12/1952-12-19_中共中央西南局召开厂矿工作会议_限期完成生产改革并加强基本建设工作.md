The CCP Central Committee Southwest Bureau convened a factory and mine work conference in November. The conference determined to accelerate the completion of production reform this winter and spring, while rapidly strengthening capital construction work.

In the three years since liberation, the restoration of factories and mines in the Southwest region has been very rapid. For example, the total output value of factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee in 1951 increased by 134 percent compared to 1950, and it is expected to increase by 62 percent in 1952 compared to 1951. The total number of employees this year increased by 63 percent compared to 1950, and labor productivity increased by 174 percent. Due to the increase in labor productivity, the output of various industries has increased greatly compared to pre-liberation levels. For example, pig iron and steel ingots in the iron and steel industry have increased more than six times compared to 1949. Equipment utilization and technical levels have far exceeded the original standards before liberation. Democratic reforms in factories and mines have been basically completed and have achieved great success. All of these have laid the foundation for large-scale economic construction in the region next year. However, at present, production management in factories and mines in the Southwest region is extremely chaotic, and a series of problems remain unresolved. Production management in factories and mines has not been properly managed, and capital construction is about to begin. This is the basic situation of factories and mines in the Southwest region at present.

Therefore, the conference decided that in addition to completing production reform work within a set time limit, factories and mines with large production tasks and heavy capital construction tasks must prioritize capital construction at the appropriate time, overcome the erroneous idea of not paying attention to capital construction, and vigorously prepare for capital construction. Party committees of each province and municipality should strengthen their leadership over the capital construction of state-owned factories and mines. In terms of capital construction procedures, they must strictly abide by the regulations of the Central People's Government and ensure quality. The conference also determined that a capital construction management agency could be set up under the financial and economic committees of each province and municipality to comprehensively grasp the capital construction work of the province or municipality. Capital construction and production in factories and mines must be strictly separated, and party committees and trade unions should be independently organized in the capital construction departments. Regarding the issue of cadres, the conference believed that it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of self-reliance and cultivate a large number of cadres in factories and mines. Regarding cadres for capital construction, the greatest determination must be made to transfer and allocate them as soon as possible to avoid being passive.

Before the end of the conference, Comrade He Long gave important instructions on future work. When talking about the need for Communist Party members and cadres working in factories and mines to study their professions, he made serious and sharp criticisms of certain conservative and backward ideas that are currently manifested in the work of factories and mines in the Southwest; and instructed everyone to attach great importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and leading cadres must lead by example, and at the same time, they must vigorously publicize this issue to both Party members and non-Party members. Comrade He Long pointed out that when emphasizing relying on the working class to do a good job in production, it is completely wrong to not respect those upright and technically skilled veteran workers, to not actively educate them, and to be unwilling to admit them into the Party when conditions are ripe, and this must be resolutely corrected. In the future, we must continue to treat the original technical engineering personnel with the correct attitude and help them to continue to transform and continue to progress. Comrade He Long then pointed out that developing Party organizations among factory and mine workers is an urgent task. The organization of the Communist Party in factories and mines should become the center of production, the center of unity, the center of ideological education, and the center for driving the entire factory (mine) forward. In this way, the Party organization will have a significant role and infinite power. This will ensure continuous progress.

    中共中央西南局召开厂矿工作会议
    限期完成生产改革并加强基本建设工作
    为迎接即将到来的全国大规模经济建设任务，中共中央西南局在十一月间召开了厂矿工作会议。会议确定今冬明春加速完成生产改革，同时迅速加强基本建设工作。
    解放三年来，西南区厂矿恢复工作很迅速，如西南军政委员会工业部所属各厂矿，一九五一年生产总值比一九五零年增长百分之一百三十四，一九五二年又将比一九五一年增长百分之六十二。职工总数今年比一九五零年增加百分之六十三，劳动生产率提高了百分之一百七十四。由于劳动生产率提高，各种工业产量都比解放前有很大增加。如钢铁工业中的生铁、钢锭等都比一九四九年提高六倍以上。设备利用率和技术水平更远远地超过解放前的原有标准。各厂矿民主改革已基本完成，获得很大成绩。这些都为明年全区的大规模经济建设奠定了基础。但是，目前西南区厂矿中，生产管理极为混乱，存在着一系列问题未得到解决。厂矿生产管理尚未搞好，就要进行基本建设。这就是目前西南区厂矿的基本情况。
    因此会议决定除限期完成生产改革工作外，凡是生产任务大、基本建设任务重的厂矿，必须适时地把基本建设放在第一位，必须克服不重视基本建设的错误思想，必须大力做好基本建设的准备。各省、市党委会应加强对国营厂矿基本建设的领导。在基本建设程序上，必须严格遵照中央人民政府的规定，并保证质量。会议还确定各省、市财政经济委员会下可设一管理基本建设的机构，通盘掌握该省市的基本建设工作。厂矿基本建设与生产必须严格分开，在基本建设部门独立地组织党委与工会。关于干部问题，会议认为必须坚决贯彻自力更生的方针，在厂矿中大批地培养干部。关于基本建设的干部，必须下最大决心，早调早分配，以免陷于被动。
    在会议结束之前，贺龙同志对今后工作作了重要指示。谈到在厂矿中工作的共产党员和干部必须钻研业务时，他对目前西南厂矿工作中所表现出来的某些保守思想和落后思想，进行了严肃、尖锐的批判；并指示大家要十分重视学习苏联先进经验，领导干部必须以身作则，同时要向党内党外大大地宣传这个问题。贺龙同志在强调依靠工人阶级搞好生产时指出，对那些正派的、有技术的老工人不大尊重，不向他们积极进行教育，不愿在条件成熟时吸收他们入党，是十分错误的，必须坚决纠正。对旧有技术工程人员，今后还必须以正确的态度对待他们，帮助他们继续改造和继续进步。贺龙同志接着指出，目前在厂矿工人中发展党的组织是迫不及待的工作。共产党在厂矿中的组织，应当成为生产的中心、团结的中心、思想教育的中心、带动全厂
    （矿）前进的中心。这样，党的组织就有了重大的作用和无穷的力量。这样就有了不断前进的保证。
