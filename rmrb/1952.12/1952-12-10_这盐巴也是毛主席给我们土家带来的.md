    "This Salt Was Also Brought to Us Tujia People by Chairman Mao"
    Editor: Lu Deming is the production committee member of Yangya Village, Bagu Township, Duyun County, Guizhou Province. He is a member of the "Tujia" ethnic minority. Before liberation, he was a poor peasant. After the land reform, he was allocated land, houses, and cattle. This year, he responded to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift, joined a mutual aid team, and actively engaged in production. This year, there was a drought, and he worked with everyone to build water conservancy projects, turning his meager five loads of dry land into paddy fields. When the rice was almost ripe, it was blown down by the wind, and they rushed to harvest and dry it. With intensive farming and more fertilizer, he achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. His yield reached 880 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 87.9% compared to last year (a normal year). Including barley, rapeseed, other grains, and sideline income, his total income this year was 5.1 million yuan. After deducting the annual expenses for food, salt, homespun cloth, and other miscellaneous items for his family of six (the eldest son having joined the army), he still had a surplus of more than one million yuan. The bumper harvest brought Lu Deming an unprecedented good life. Before liberation, his family of seven lived with the cattle. He rented more than 20 loads of land from the landlord Wang Zhonghua, and after paying rent every year, there was nothing left to eat. Usually, they could only eat some coarse grains, bran, and thin porridge made with wild vegetables, and sometimes they would go hungry and shed tears. In the past, they never knew what cotton clothes and quilts were. In winter, they would cover themselves with straw and sleep beside the firewood. One side of their body would get hot, then they would turn over to warm the other side. But this year? Not only can they eat their fill of rice, but they also ate ten jin of pork and twenty jin of lard. As for cotton clothes and quilts, they have them all. What makes this year's life particularly different from the past is that they can eat enough salt. Before liberation, ethnic minorities often had to endure the exploitation of "a dou of rice for a jin of salt," to the point where they could not afford salt. This year, Lu Deming ate fifty jin of salt. Lu Deming often says:
    "Every time I pick up my rice bowl, I think of Chairman Mao. This salt was also brought to us Tujia people by Chairman Mao." Li Yongfen

### “这盐巴也是毛主席给我们土家带来的”

    “这盐巴也是毛主席给我们土家带来的”
    编辑同志：陆德明是贵州省都匀县坝固乡羊亚村的生产委员，是少数民族“土家”族人。他在解放前是贫农，土地改革后分得了田地、房屋和耕牛。今年他响应了毛主席增产节约的号召，参加了互助组，积极生产。今年天旱，他和大家一起兴修水利，使自己仅有的五挑干田变成水田。稻子快成熟时，被风吹倒了，他们进行了抢收和抢晒。加上精耕细作，多施肥料，今年得到空前的丰收。他的每亩田产谷达八百八十斤，比去年（一般年成）增产百分之八十七点九。加上大麦、油菜籽等杂粮和副业收入，他今年收入的总值为五百一十万元。这笔收入除去全家六口人（大儿已参军不计在内）全年需要的吃粮、盐巴、土布及其他杂项开支，还余一百多万元。丰收给陆德明带来了从没有过的好生活。解放前他全家七口人，和牛住在一起。租种地主王中华家二十多挑田，每年除了交租，就没有了吃的。平时就只能吃些杂粮和糠皮，野菜煮的稀饭，有时就饿着肚子流眼泪。过去他们从来不知道什么叫棉衣和棉被，冬天就盖着稻草睡在柴火边。一边身子烤热了，反过身来烤另一边。今年呢？不仅米饭能够吃饱，而且还吃了十斤猪肉和二十斤猪油。至于棉衣、棉被都有了。今年的生活和过去特别不同的是：能吃上足够的盐巴了。解放前少数民族经常得忍受“斗米斤盐”的剥削，以致吃不上盐巴。今年陆德明就吃了五十斤盐。陆德明常说：
    “一端起饭碗就想起了毛主席，这盐巴也是毛主席给我们土家带来的”。　李永芬
