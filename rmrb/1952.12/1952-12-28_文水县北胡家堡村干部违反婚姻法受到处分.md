Response to readers' criticisms and suggestions in the People's Daily:

    To the Editor: Regarding the situation reported in the People's Daily on May 21st, "Cadres of Beihujiabao Village, Wenshui County, Seriously Violate Marriage Law and Infringe Upon Human Rights," the Shanxi Provincial People's Supervision Committee instructed the Yuci Prefectural People's Supervision Office to order the Wenshui County People's Supervision Committee to send cadres to the area for inspection. The results confirmed that the report was entirely factual. In order to implement the Marriage Law and protect the rights and interests of women, the Shanxi Provincial People's Supervision Committee, in addition to recommending that the local People's Court prosecute the relevant hooligans, decided to remove Wang Chengding, the leading village cadre, from his post and prosecute him, and notified the entire province on December 6th.

    编辑同志：五月二十一日人民日报刊载的“山西文水县北胡家堡村干部严重违反婚姻法侵犯人权”的情况，经山西省人民监察委员会责令榆次专署人民监察处转令文水县人民监察委员会派干部前往当地检查，结果证明完全是事实。为了贯彻婚姻法，为了保护妇女利益，山西省人民监察委员会除建议当地人民法院对有关的流氓分子进行法办外，决定对为首的村干部王成丁撤职法办，并于十二月六日通报全省。　山西省人民监察委员会通讯组
