    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Should Emphasize Capital Construction Work
    To the Editor: The capital construction work of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau is very chaotic. One of the bureau's capital construction projects has adopted a method of designing and constructing simultaneously. Construction started a long time ago, and even is almost completed before the technical design is made. The design that is made is also incorrect, and often needs to be changed.
    The newly built office building of the bureau also began construction of the heating system without any design at all, resulting in repeated changes to the material plan, with five or six additions, but still not complete.
    I hope that the leading cadres of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau will quickly strengthen leadership and inspection of capital construction.

    北京电信局应重视基本建设工作
    编辑同志：北京市电信局的基本建设工作很混乱。该局的一项基本建设工程，采取了一面设计，
    一面施工的办法。开工很久，甚至快要完工，才做出技术设计。做出的设计也不正确，常常要变更。
    该局新建的办公楼安装暖气工程，也根本没有设计就施了工。以致用料计划屡次变更，追加了五、六次之多，还不完全。
    我希望北京市电信局领导干部迅速加强对基本建设的领导和检查。
