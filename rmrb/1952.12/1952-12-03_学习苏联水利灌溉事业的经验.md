    Learning from the Soviet Union's Experience in Water Conservancy and Irrigation
    Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission

    In April of this year, I participated in the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to visit the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. We received a warm welcome and sincere, selfless assistance from the Soviet Communist Party, government, and people. We witnessed firsthand how the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, were carrying out great peaceful construction with confidence in loving their motherland and defending peace, and marching towards a communist society.

    In the Soviet Union, it is very clear that water conservancy serves agriculture. After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet Communist Party, the government, and Lenin and Stalin themselves attached great importance to this issue. In the early days of the Soviet regime, Lenin pointed out in a letter to the Communists of the Caucasus: "Irrigation is the most needed, and it is most convenient to help transform the border areas, revive the border areas, bury everything old, and consolidate the cause of transitioning to socialism." In 1924, the Soviet Union suffered a drought, and Stalin also pointed out:
    "To greatly improve agriculture and free our country from the disasters of climate forever, it is necessary to develop irrigation." This shows Lenin's and Stalin's concern for water conservancy and irrigation in socialist construction.

    In the era of Tsarist rule, Russia's irrigated area was small, and the irrigation methods were unscientific. After the October Revolution, with the development of socialist construction, the Soviet Union planned and built modern irrigation projects and new irrigation systems. In 1952, the area under new irrigation was 10 million hectares, and it is planned to complete 22.2 million hectares by 1957. In the Azerbaijan Republic, the irrigated area accounts for 75% of the total area. In the Kazakh Republic, the irrigated area in 1952 was 270% of that in 1925; in the Georgian Republic, the irrigated area increased fivefold compared to before the October Revolution.

    The Soviet Union successfully carried out huge water conservancy construction, realized Stalin's plan to transform nature, changed the climate, expanded the irrigated area, improved the soil, implemented advanced agricultural science and technology, and ensured bumper harvests year after year. Therefore, in terms of agricultural production, the annual increase is 5 million metric tons of rice, 80 million metric tons of wheat, 3 million metric tons of cotton, and 6 million tons of sugar beet. In terms of animal husbandry, the annual increase is 2 million head of cattle and 9 million sheep. With the development of agricultural production, the material and cultural life of the broad masses of collective farmers in the Soviet Union has been rapidly improved.

    In order to further adapt to the needs of agricultural mechanization, the Soviet Union is improving and building new irrigation systems, namely, mobile channel irrigation systems. This irrigation system converts some fixed channels into channels that are temporarily excavated by machines.

    Soviet irrigation methods are divided into three types: furrow irrigation, ditch irrigation, and inter-ditch irrigation. Furrow irrigation is mostly used for wheat crops, and furrowing and sowing are carried out simultaneously. Because this crop is densely sown in a crisscross pattern, it cannot be cultivated or irrigated by ditch irrigation. The length and size of the furrows are determined according to the land slope and soil properties (leakage conditions), generally 3.6 meters wide and 50 to 250 meters long. The furrow ridges are triangular, with a bottom width of 60 cm and a height of 20 cm. After subsidence, the height is about 15 cm, which does not affect mechanical harvesting.

    Ditch irrigation is suitable for cultivated crops (corn, sunflower, cotton, sugar beet, etc.). In order to facilitate cultivation, the row spacing of crops is generally 70 cm. When cultivating, ditches are opened with a ditching machine, with a width of 50 cm and a depth of 20 to 25 cm. The amount of irrigation water should be about one-third of the depth of the ditch, otherwise it will waste water and damage the soil structure. The length of the ditch is determined by the terrain and soil quality, generally 50 to 250 meters. In the past, irrigation was done by manually digging ditch edges to divert water. Recently, siphon methods have been used to divert water. This method is convenient for diverting water and saving labor, and does not damage the cultivated land at the head of the ditch or destroy the soil. Siphon tubes are divided into soft and hard types. Soft tubes are made of steel wire, wrapped with white cloth and coated with asphalt; hard tubes are made of lead, iron, etc. The diameter of the tube is 3 to 6 cm, and the length of the tube is about 1 meter. At the same time, one end is placed in the water diversion ditch and the other end is placed in the irrigation ditch, but the water level in the water diversion ditch must be 4 cm higher than the irrigation ditch.

    Inter-ditch irrigation uses infiltration capacity for irrigation. The advantage of this irrigation method is that it saves labor and uses fewer siphon tubes; however, because the irrigation time is extended, it will inevitably increase evaporation. The Cotton Experiment Institute of the Azerbaijan Republic has conducted experiments on the above three irrigation methods. The results of the experiments are: furrow irrigation uses 2,225 cubic meters of water per hectare of cotton field and yields 1,290 kg of cotton, requiring 172 cubic meters of water per 100 kg of cotton; inter-ditch irrigation uses 2,035 cubic meters of water per hectare of cotton field and yields 1,600 kg of cotton, requiring 127 cubic meters of water per 100 kg; ditch irrigation uses 1,875 cubic meters of water per hectare of cotton field and yields 2,050 kg of cotton, requiring 92 cubic meters of water per 100 kg. According to the above comparison, we can see that ditch irrigation uses less water and has a larger yield, making it the best irrigation method.

    What are the advantages of the new irrigation method? According to actual analysis, the first is to eliminate the possibility of soil alkalization and the breeding of weeds and pests on both sides of fixed channels, while increasing the irrigated area; the second is that it can save water, reduce seepage rate and improve soil conditions; the third is that it is convenient for mechanized farming, increases mechanical efficiency, and reduces arable land costs; and the last is that the reduction of fixed channels reduces sand removal work.

    The Soviet Union attaches special importance to preventing soil alkalization in irrigated areas. The Soviet Union's method of preventing alkalization is different from that of capitalist countries. Capitalist countries only know how to passively prevent (washing alkali, drainage, etc.), and cannot fundamentally solve the problem of land alkalization.

    One of the main measures taken by the Soviet Union to prevent soil alkalization is to improve the soil and increase land fertility. Soil can be divided into unstructured soil and granular soil in terms of its structure. The Soviet Union plants shelterbelts in arid areas, implements correct farming and fertilization methods, and sows drought-resistant crops and crops suitable for local conditions. In irrigated areas, water is used sparingly to stabilize the soil structure and increase fertility. Structural soil can retain moisture, absorb nutrients, and reduce evaporation; at the same time, because structural soil destroys capillary action and prevents groundwater from rising, it can prevent soil alkalization in irrigated areas.

    Saving water and preventing groundwater from rising and causing soil alkalization is a very important issue in irrigation management. According to experiments by the Cotton Island State Farm in the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union, the following methods can be used to prevent the rise of the groundwater level.

    The first is to plant trees. Plant trees (choose trees or fruit trees that absorb the most water) on both sides of permanent channels, each 12 meters wide. This can reduce channel leakage and prevent the groundwater level from rising. According to experiments at this farm, each 12- to 17-year-old tree absorbs and evaporates 90 cubic meters of water per year. In the experiment, when the trees in the shelterbelt were felled for a 200-meter section for observation, the groundwater level in the vicinity rose from 2.32 meters to 1.4 meters. This fully demonstrates the role of tree planting.

    The second is to dig drainage ditches. This method can be used when the groundwater level is relatively high and affects crop growth. The depth of the drainage ditch should be 1.5 meters deeper than the groundwater level.

    The third is to implement a grass-crop rotation system to improve the soil.

    The Soviet Union also has mature experience in correctly grasping the amount and timing of irrigation. The amount and timing of irrigation are determined according to soil moisture and crop types. The same crops with the same root system can adopt the same amount of irrigation. Crops with long root systems such as wheat and barley use more water; crops with short root systems such as corn and cotton use less water. Winter wheat in the North Caucasus region is generally irrigated three times, mainly before sowing. Before sowing, 1,000 to 1,500 cubic meters per hectare are irrigated, with a penetration depth of 1.5 to 2 meters. When wheat plants develop and joint, 800 to 1,000 cubic meters are irrigated. When wheat plants head and grain fills, 800 to 1,000 cubic meters are irrigated. Corn is generally irrigated four times (before sowing, when large leaves appear, when aerial roots appear, and when heading and grain fills), each time requiring 800 to 1,000 cubic meters of water, with a penetration depth of 1 meter.

    In order to facilitate the implementation of mechanized farming methods, improve the soil, and increase yields, it is also necessary to master irrigation techniques. The requirements of irrigation technology are: first, quantification, not too much or too little irrigation; second, adjusting the land in the irrigated area to make the water volume uniform; third, irrigating according to the crop development time and mechanical farming requirements; fourth, combining irrigation with soil improvement and increased fertility; fifth, increasing yields.

    The advanced experience of the Soviet Union's irrigation undertaking is worthy of our good study. We know that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. The great achievements of Soviet water conservancy construction fully prove the superiority of the socialist system. Without the socialist system, the rapid development of water conservancy and irrigation undertakings is impossible. Now, the water conservancy work of New China is still very young. In order to meet the large-scale economic construction and continue to develop water conservancy construction, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the design, construction, and management of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project to benefit Jinan and Weifang, and in the planning of the Yellow River Basin (channel planning, sediment treatment, building design, irrigation management, watershed planning principles, etc.), we have received great help from Soviet experts Bukov, Shabayev, Antonov, and other comrades. Facts have proved that without the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and without the help of Soviet experts, our water conservancy construction work would take many detours and could not be carried out so quickly.

    学习苏联水利灌溉事业的经验
    黄河水利委员会副主任　赵明甫
    今年四月我参加中国农民代表参观团，去伟大的社会主义国家——苏联参观。我们受到苏联共产党、政府和人民的热情欢迎和诚挚无私的帮助，我们亲眼看到了苏联人民在列宁、斯大林党的领导下，满怀着热爱祖国捍卫和平的信心，进行着伟大的和平建设，向着共产主义社会迈进。
    水利为农业服务，在苏联是很明确的。十月革命胜利后，苏联共产党、政府及列宁、斯大林本人，都十分重视这个问题。在苏维埃政权建立初期，列宁在给高加索共产党员的信上指出：“水利灌溉是最需要的，它最便于帮助改造边疆，复兴边疆，埋葬一切旧的，而使过渡到社会主义的事业巩固起来。”一九二四年苏联遭受了旱灾，斯大林也指出：
    “把农业大大提高，使我国永远摆脱气候的灾害，必须开展灌溉事业。”这就说明了在社会主义建设中，列宁、斯大林对于水利灌溉事业的关心。
    在沙皇统治时代，俄国的灌溉面积是不多的，而且灌溉方法是不科学的。十月革命后，随着社会主义建设的发展，苏联有计划地建设了近代的灌溉工程，建设了新式灌溉系统。一九五二年实行新式灌溉的面积已有一千万公顷，计划到一九五七年完成二千二百万公顷。阿塞拜疆加盟共和国灌溉面积占全面积的百分之七十五。卡查赫加盟共和国一九五二年的灌溉面积，为一九二五年的百分之二百七十；格鲁吉亚加盟共和国灌溉面积比十月革命前增加了五倍。
    苏联成功地进行了巨大的水利建设，实现了斯大林改造自然的计划，改变了气候，扩大了灌溉面积，改良了土壤，实行了先进的农业科学技术，保证了年年丰收。因此，在农产方面，每年可增产大米五百万公担，小麦八千万公担，棉花三百万公担，甜菜六百万吨。在牧畜方面，每年可增加牛二百万头，羊九百万只。随着农业生产的发展，苏联广大集体农民的物质和文化生活，得到了迅速的提高。
    苏联为了进一步适应农业机械化发展的需要，正在改良和建设新式灌溉系统，即活动渠道灌溉系统。这种灌溉系统就是把一部分固定性的渠道，改为用机器临时开挖的渠道。
    苏联的灌溉方法分为畦灌、沟灌和隔沟灌溉三种。畦灌多用于麦类作物，调畦和播种同时进行。因为这种作物实行交叉密播，不能中耕，也不能采用沟灌办法。畦的长短、大小根据土地坡度、土壤性质（漏水情况）规定，一般宽三点六公尺，长五十至二百五十公尺。畦梗为三角形，底宽六十公分，高二十公分，经下沉后，高度约在十五公分上下，这样高度是不影响机械收割的。
    沟灌方法适用于中耕作物（玉米、向日葵、棉花、甜菜等）。为便于中耕，作物的行距一般为七十公分。中耕时利用开沟机开沟，沟宽五十公分，深二十至二十五公分。灌溉水量以相当沟的深度的三分之一为宜，否则一方面浪费用水，一方面破坏土壤结构。沟长是根据地形土质决定的，一般为五十至二百五十公尺。过去灌溉时，用人工开挖沟沿引水，最近利用虹吸方法引水。这种方法既便于引水和节约人力，又不致冲毁沟首耕地，或破坏土壤。虹吸管分软硬两种，软管用钢丝制成，外缠白布，涂以柏油；硬管用铅皮铁等做成。管的直径为三到六公分，管长一公尺左右。同时一端置于导水沟内，一端放于灌沟内，但导水沟水位须高于灌沟四公分。
    隔沟灌溉法利用渗透能力进行灌溉。这种灌溉方法的好处是能节约人力，少用虹吸管；但因灌溉时间延长，势必增加蒸发量。阿塞拜疆加盟共和国棉花试验所对上述三种灌溉方法进行过试验，试验结果是：畦灌每公顷棉田用水二千二百二十五立方公尺，收棉一千二百九十公斤，每一百公斤棉花需水一百七十二立方公尺；隔沟灌溉，每公顷棉田用水二千零三十五立方公尺，收棉一千六百公斤，每一百公斤需水一百二十七立方公尺；沟灌，每公顷棉田用水一千八百七十五立方公尺，收棉二千零五十公斤，每一百公斤需水九十二立方公尺。根据以上比较，我们可以看出沟灌用水既少，产量又大，是一种最好的灌溉办法。
    新式灌溉方法有那些优点呢？根据实际分析，首先是消除固定渠道两侧土壤碱化和生殖杂草、害虫的可能，同时增加了灌溉面积；其次是可以经济用水，减少渗水率和改良土壤状况；再次是便于机械化耕作，增加了机械效率，减少耕地费用；最后是由于固定渠道缩短，减少了清沙工作。
    苏联特别重视防止灌溉区土壤碱化。苏联防止碱化的方法和资本主义国家不同。资本主义国家只知消极防止（洗碱、排水等），不能从根本上解决土地碱化问题。
    苏联防止土壤碱化的主要措施之一是改良土壤，增加土地肥力。土壤就其结构可分无结构土壤和团粒状土壤两种。苏联在干旱地区种植防护林带，实行正确的耕作和施肥方法，播种抗旱作物及适合地方条件的作物。在灌溉区，实行节约用水，稳定土壤结构，增加肥力。结构土壤能保持水分，吸收养料，减少蒸发；同时因为结构土壤破坏了毛细管作用，防止地下水上升，就可以防止灌区土壤的碱化。
    节约用水，防止地下水上升引起土壤碱化，是灌溉管理中非常重要的问题。根据苏联卡查赫加盟共和国棉花岛国营农场试验，防止地下水位上升，有如下的办法。
    第一是植树。在永久渠道两旁各植十二公尺宽的树（应选择吸水最多的树或果树）。这样就可以减少渠道渗漏，防止地下水位上升。据这个农场试验，每棵十二到十七岁的树，每年吸收和蒸发水分九十立方公尺。在试验中，将防护林的树伐去二百公尺地段进行观察，附近的地下水位就由二点三二公尺升至一点四公尺。这充分说明了种树的作用。
    第二是挖排水沟。在地下水位比较高，并且影响农作物生长时，可以采用这一方法。排水沟的深度比地下水位要深一点五公尺。
    第三是实行草田轮作制，改良土壤。
    关于正确地掌握灌溉的数量和时间，苏联也有成熟的经验。灌溉数量和时间，是根据土壤湿度和农作物种类而决定的。同样根系的农作物可以采取同等的灌溉量。根系长的农作物如小麦、大麦等，用水较多；根系短的农作物如玉米、棉花等，用水就少。冬小麦在北高加索地区一般灌溉三次，以播种前一次为主。播种前每公顷灌溉一千至一千五百立方公尺，渗透深度一点五到二公尺。麦株发义拔节时，灌溉八百到一千立方公尺。麦株出穗结实时，灌溉八百至一千立方公尺。玉米一般灌溉四次（播种前，出大叶时，生气根时，出穗结实时），每次需水八百至一千立方公尺，渗透深度一公尺。
    为了便于实行机械化耕作方法，改良土壤，提高产量，还必须掌握灌溉技术。灌溉技术的要求是：第一、定量，不多灌，也不少灌；第二、调整灌区土地，使水量均匀；第三、根据农作物发育时间和机械耕作要求进行灌溉；第四、要结合改良土壤，增加肥力；第五、要能提高产量。
    苏联的灌溉事业的先进经验，是值得我们很好地学习的。我们知道苏联的今天就是我们的明天。苏联水利建设的伟大成就，充分证明了社会主义制度的优越性。没有社会主义制度，水利灌溉事业的迅速发展是不可能的。现在新中国的水利工作还很年轻，为了迎接大规模的经济建设，继续开展水利建设，我们必须学习苏联的先进经验。我们在引黄灌溉济卫工程的设计、施工、管理工作中，在黄河流域规划中（渠道规划、泥沙的处理、建筑物设计、灌溉的管理、流域规划的原则等），都得到苏联专家布可夫、沙巴页夫、安东诺夫等同志的大力帮助。事实证明，没有苏联的先进经验，没有苏联专家的帮助，我们的水利建设工作就要走很多弯路，就不可能很迅速地开展起来。
