    Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee Holds Meeting
    Discussing Basic Construction Preparatory Work
    Deputy Director Jia Tuofu Emphasizes Doing a Good Job in Three Areas Including Design
    [By this Newspaper] The Government Administration Council’s Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government convened a meeting on December 23 to discuss how to carry out preparatory work for basic construction in 1953 this winter. The meeting was presided over by Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Government Administration Council’s Financial and Economic Committee. He outlined the progress made by various ministries in preparing for basic construction over the past two months and gave important instructions for the work this winter.
    Deputy Director Jia Tuofu pointed out: Since the Government Administration Council’s Financial and Economic Committee held a basic construction meeting in late October, personally presided over by Director Chen Yun, various ministries have conducted extensive mobilization in ideology and organization, enabling the broad masses of cadres to recognize the important significance of "placing basic construction in the primary position"; at the same time, a considerable number of design and construction technicians have been transferred and assembled, and the preparation of the basic construction plan for 1953 has been actively carried out. This work has not been done perfectly and still has many shortcomings. For example, in organizational work, a situation of mutual cooperation and comprehensive and systematic work has not yet been formed; the number of people transferred is still insufficient, the quality is not high, and the types are incomplete. In terms of planning work, the several changes in control figures have made the preparation work more difficult. However, the basic construction team has been and is being largely formed, which means that a good start has been made. This has laid a certain foundation and prepared certain conditions for future work.
    Deputy Director Jia Tuofu then gave detailed instructions on the work this winter. He said: From now until the first quarter of next year, we should focus on three key areas and actively carry out preparations for basic construction. These three key areas are: accelerating survey and design work, organizing and training construction forces, and preparing and transporting engineering materials. All ministries should adopt parallel operations to do these three tasks well, because the three are inseparable.
    After describing the heavy task of basic construction projects next year, Deputy Director Jia Tuofu pointed out: If the design work cannot keep up, it will seriously affect the progress of construction next year. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly establish design institutions, rely on existing manpower, and start work immediately. The first is to arrange a work progress plan according to the priority of the projects, the order of time, and the preparation situation, so as to carry out the work in a planned and step-by-step manner. Secondly, design standards should be drafted according to advanced quotas to ensure design quality and serve as criteria for reviewing designs. Again, all ministries should immediately grasp the design review work. This work is an important part of the design work and requires a long time. Therefore, it should be carried out jointly by a certain number and quality of technical personnel under strong leadership.
    Regarding the organization and training of construction forces, Deputy Director Jia Tuofu said: The significance of training workers lies in cultivating backbones, enhancing the organization of workers, and improving the technical level of workers, so as to adapt to large-scale and highly concentrated construction work. Among the workers, the focus is on training workers in special types of work and technically strong types of work, such as metal structure workers, pipeline workers, etc. Among the staff, the proportion of site directors, construction workers, accountants, etc. should be determined, and then training should be carried out separately according to professional fields. In addition to political education, the content of training should include learning technical standards, operating procedures, and advanced experience. The training methods can adopt methods such as large lectures, operational exercises, and advanced production experience promotion conferences. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has some good experience in fixing and training construction workers in the Northeast, which can be used for learning and reference by various ministries. In addition, attention must also be paid to construction organization and deployment work, such as establishing various engineering companies, building processing factories, and compiling construction organization designs; at the same time, next year's engineering tasks should be distributed to various construction departments in a timely manner so that the departments can prepare early.
    Regarding the issue of material preparation, Deputy Director Jia Tuofu pointed out that this is a complex issue. It is related to the production plans of many departments next year, to domestic and foreign trade, and to transportation, finance, and municipal construction. Therefore, various ministries must quickly calculate and propose plans so as to prepare in advance. At the same time, various ministries must simplify financial procedures, strengthen transportation plans, and begin transporting certain necessary materials in a planned manner; various departments must also cooperate with each other in order to balance the supply and demand situation.
    Deputy Director Jia Tuofu emphatically pointed out that the focus of the above-mentioned preparatory work is on design. Only by doing a good job in design work can we accurately carry out construction and material preparation work. That is to say, only by grasping this key link can we drive the entire work.
    Finally, Deputy Director Jia Tuofu pointed out that in order to do a good job in preparing for basic construction next year, it is necessary to continuously improve leadership methods. The first is that the main leaders of various ministries must personally lead the various preparatory work, frequently summarize them, and conduct unified command in a concentrated manner, and oppose the bureaucratic work attitude. Secondly, various departments should support each other. The planned economy requires that various departments must cooperate closely, because without cooperating with other departments, if the work of other departments is not done well, the work of this department will certainly not be done well. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose departmentalism. Again, it is necessary to promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, so as to overcome the shortcomings in the current work and constantly spur us forward. He said: When we are striding forward on the road of large-scale economic construction, we will inevitably encounter resistance from traditional habits, conservative ideas, departmentalism, and lax work styles. We must carry out criticism and self-criticism with a serious and responsible spirit to overcome these obstacles. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose liberalism.
    After Deputy Director Jia Tuofu spoke, Minister of Geology Li Siguang, Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao, Vice Minister of Heavy Industry Lü Dong, Minister of Fuel Industry Chen Yu, and Vice Minister of Construction Engineering Song Yuhe of the Central People's Government spoke successively and conducted discussions. Deputy Director Jia Tuofu gave specific answers and instructions to several specific questions raised at the meeting.

    政务院财政经济委员会召开会议
    讨论基本建设准备工作
    贾拓夫副主任强调作好设计等三项工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于十二月二十三日召开会议，讨论今冬如何进行一九五三年基本建设准备工作的问题。会议由政务院财政经济委员会副主任贾拓夫主持。他概述了两个月来各部准备基本建设工作的情况，并对今冬工作作了重要指示。
    贾拓夫副主任指出：十月下旬政务院财政经济委员会在陈云主任亲自主持下召开基本建设会议以后，各部都在思想上和组织上进行了广泛的动员，使广大干部认清了“把基本建设放在首要地位”的重要意义；同时抽调和集结了相当数量的设计和施工技术人员，并积极进行了一九五三年基本建设计划的编制工作。这些工作作得都还不够完备，还有许多缺点。例如在组织工作上，还没有形成各方面相互配合、全面地系统地进行工作的状况；抽调的人员数量也还不足，质量不高，种类不全。在计划工作方面，由于控制数字几度变动，使编制工作也增加了一些困难。但是，基本建设的队伍已经和正在大体组成，就是说已经有了一个良好的开端。这就为今后的工作奠定了一定的基础，准备了一定的条件。
    贾拓夫副主任接着就今冬工作作了详尽的指示。他说：从现在到明年第一季度，应该抓紧三个环节，积极进行基本建设的准备工作。这三个环节是：加紧进行勘察设计工作，组织与训练施工力量，进行工程材料的准备与运输。各部都应采用平行作业的办法，把这三项工作做好，因为三者是不可分离的。
    贾拓夫副主任叙述了明年基本建设工程的繁重任务后指出：如果设计工作赶不上，就将严重影响明年施工的进度。因此必须迅速把设计机构建立起来，依靠现有人力，立即开始工作。首先是按工程的主次、时间的先后、准备工作的情况，排定一个工作进度计划，以便有计划有步骤地进行工作。其次，应该根据先进定额，拟出设计标准，以便保证设计质量和作为审查设计的准则。再次，各部应该立即抓紧设计审查工作。这项工作，是设计工作中的一项重要工作，所需时间也较长，因此应该在强有力的领导下，集中一定数量和质量的技术人员共同进行。
    关于施工力量的组织与训练问题，贾拓夫副主任说：训练工人的意义，在于培养骨干、增强工人的组织性和提高工人的技术水平，以适应大规模的集中性很强的施工工作。在工人中，重点是训练特种工和技术性强的工种的工人，如金属结构工人、管道工人等等。在职员中，应确定工地主任、施工员、会计等的比例，然后按专业分别进行训练。训练的内容，除政治教育外，应学习技术标准、操作规程和先进经验。训练的方法，可采用上大课、操作演习、先进生产经验推广会议等方式。重工业部在东北固定和训练施工工人的工作中，已有若干较好的经验，可供各部学习和参考。此外，还必须注意施工组织与部署工作，如成立各种工程公司，修建加工工厂，编制施工组织设计等；同时要将明年工程任务及时分配给各施工部门，以便各部门能提早准备。
    关于材料准备问题，贾拓夫副主任指出，这是一个复杂的问题。它关联到明年许多部门的生产计划，关联到国内外贸易，关联到运输、财务和市政建设等项工作。因此各部必须迅速计算，提出计划，以便提前准备。同时，各部必须简化财务手续，加强运输计划，并有计划地开始进行某些必需物料的运输；各部门之间还须互相配合，以便平衡供给与需要的情况。
    贾拓夫副主任着重指出：以上各项准备工作，重点在于设计。只有作好设计工作，才能准确地进行施工与材料的准备工作。这就是说，只有抓住这一环节，才能带动全部工作。
    最后，贾拓夫副主任指出：为了作好明年基本建设的准备工作，需要不断改进领导方法。首先是各部主要负责人必须亲自领导各项准备工作，经常加以总结，集中统一地进行指挥，反对官僚主义的工作态度。其次，各部门要互相支援。计划经济要求各部门必须密切配合，因为不与别的部门配合，别的部门工作搞不好，本部门的工作也一定搞不好。因此就要反对本位主义。再次，要发扬批评与自我批评的精神，这样才能克服当前工作中的缺点，不断鞭策我们前进。他说：当我们大踏步地在大规模经济建设的道路上前进的时候，必然会遇到传统习惯、保守思想、本位主义、散漫作风等的抵抗，我们必须以严肃负责的精神，进行批评与自我批评，克服这些障碍。因而必须坚决地反对自由主义。
    贾拓夫副主任发言后，中央人民政府地质部部长李四光、铁道部副部长吕正操、重工业部副部长吕东、燃料工业部部长陈郁、建筑工程部副部长宋裕和等先后发言，进行讨论。对于会上提出的若干具体问题，贾拓夫副主任又作了具体的解答和指示。
