Before Kondratov and the other six boarded the plane, representatives of Chinese literary and art workers present presented them with flowers on behalf of the Chinese people to express their gratitude for their outstanding artistic performances throughout China and their contributions to strengthening the friendship and cultural exchange between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

Before boarding the plane, Churaki and others had a cordial conversation with the Chinese literary and art workers who had come to see them off in the airport waiting room. Halima Naserova even happily taught Guo Lanying to sing the famous song "Kazakh Waltz." After each rendition, she would happily say in Chinese, "One more time!" As Churaki and others boarded the plane, they waved repeatedly to the people who had come to see them off, saying affectionately, "We will be back!"
