    Fuliang County People's Government Should Correct the Mistake of Neglecting Forest Protection Work
    To the Editor: The Fuliang County People's Government in Jiangxi Province neglects forest protection work and fails to educate and stop the masses from burning mountains for cultivation, resulting in serious losses of national resources and affecting the development of forest protection work in neighboring areas.
    There is a high mountain called Baishita (White Stone Pagoda) at the junction of the county and Qimen and Xiuning counties in Anhui Province, spanning more than twenty miles, with an area of about 20,000 hectares. The foot of the mountain contains a large amount of porcelain clay, and it was closed for afforestation and prohibited from cultivation more than a hundred years ago, thus forming a large area of natural miscellaneous wood forest. However, the Fuliang County People's Government has consistently neglected the policy of forest protection, allowing people from all directions to burn and cultivate here. Currently, the area burned and cultivated accounts for about one-third of the entire mountain. Many people in Xiuning County also went to reclaim land and began to doubt the county's policy of prohibiting burning mountains for cultivation. We believe that Fuliang County should immediately attach importance to and implement the forest protection policy, educate the masses to stop burning and cultivating Baishita Mountain, so as to avoid further damage to the large number of natural miscellaneous wood forests and the porcelain clay under the mountain.

    浮梁县人民政府应该纠正忽视护林工作的错误
    编辑同志：江西浮梁县人民政府忽视护林工作，对群众烧垦山林的行为不予教育制止，以致造成国家资源的严重损失，并影响了邻近地区护林工作的开展。
    在该县和安徽省祁门、休宁两县毗连处有一座叫白石塔的高山，纵横二十余里，面积约二万公顷左右。该山山脚蕴藏大量瓷土，在百余年前被封山禁垦，因而养成了很大面积的天然杂木林。而浮梁县人民政府一直忽视护林政策，任凭四方群众来此烧垦，目前烧垦面积已占全山三分之一左右。休宁县有许多群众也去开垦，并且对本县禁止烧垦山林的政策发生怀疑。我们认为：浮梁县应该立即重视和贯彻护林政策，教育群众停止烧垦白石塔山，以免使该山大量天然杂木林及山下瓷土遭受更大损失。
