    Congratulating Our Army on the Great Victory on the Shangganling Front
    The American invading army's offensive at Shangganling, north of Jinhua, which they boasted as "the fiercest offensive in the past year," has been completely shattered by the heroic Korean and Chinese People's Army. In the month and a half of fighting at Shangganling, our army annihilated more than 25,000 enemy soldiers and seized and consumed a large amount of enemy military supplies. We pay eternal tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the Battle of Shangganling, and we pay the highest respect to the heroic troops and combat heroes on the Shangganling front.
    The Battle of Shangganling, although only a battle on a very small position, was rare in the world's war history in terms of its intensity and the bravery and tenacity of our army. In order to seize several hilltops with an area of only three square kilometers, the enemy invested more than two divisions of infantry, more than 100 tanks, and the artillery reserve of the Eighth Army. They fired an average of more than 24,000 shells every day, with nearly 300,000 shells in the most intense day and night; an average of 63 aircraft sorties per day, with as many as 250 sorties on the most intense day, dropping more than 500 heavy bombs and many napalm bombs; and 30 to 70 tanks were deployed every day for destructive shooting. So much steel was continuously poured onto such a small position that the hilltops were cut down by two meters, the rocks on the mountain were blasted into black powder gravel more than one foot thick, and many strong tunnels were shortened by three to four meters. In order to attack a hilltop, the enemy often used four or five battalions of troops to launch repeated group charges, sometimes attacking twenty or thirty times a day. However, under such crazy and cruel attacks by the enemy, after more than a month of fighting, our brave and tenacious Korean and Chinese troops not only stood firm on their positions like invincible giants, but also annihilated a large number of enemies and constantly carried out mobile assaults. The enemy paid the price of more than 25,000 casualties and the destruction of more than 200 aircraft, but could not advance a single step.
    In this Shangganling campaign, the Korean and Chinese People's Army created a great victory with unparalleled brave and tenacious fighting, which is undoubtedly a huge contribution to the cause of the world's people against American aggression and defending world peace.
    In the Battle of Shangganling, the vigorous morale, heroic spirit, and high degree of wisdom of the Korean and Chinese troops were vivid manifestations of the true qualities of the people's army. Heroes of the Dong Cunrui and Matrosov type emerged in large numbers on the Korean front. Platoon leader Sun Zhanyuan, with both legs broken, continued to direct the battle and captured the enemy's position; when repelling the enemy's counterattack, he single-handedly fought two machine guns, and finally, when the bullets ran out, he pulled the pin of a grenade and rolled into the enemy crowd. Huang Jiguang, a communications soldier of a battalion headquarters, blocked the enemy's machine gun with his body in order to clear the obstacles in the way of our army's advance, and used hand grenades to destroy the enemy's other two machine guns. Machine gunner Chen Zhiguo used his own body as a machine gun shooting platform to protect his comrades and defeat the enemy. A telephone operator, on the verge of sacrifice, still pinched the wires with both hands to maintain the connection between the forward position and the command headquarters. The earth-shattering fearless spirit of our army's heroes will be forever remembered in the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world.
    In the past two years, our commanders and fighters have accumulated rich combat experience in actual combat. They fought against the most barbaric and cruel American invading army armed to the teeth, and learned the skills of joint operations of infantry, artillery, and other arms, enabling the weapons we constantly supported to exert their maximum effectiveness in their hands. The enemy also had to admit: "On the Jinhua area battlefield, the intense concentration of Chinese artillery fire has begun to dominate the entire battle," and could not but admit that the American invading army and the Li Chengwan bandit army suffered a tragic defeat "because Chinese artillery played an amazing role." Not only that, they also learned the offensive and defensive battles of the positions, achieving invincibility in attack and impregnability in defense, and have been trained to become a powerful armed force capable of mastering the laws of modern warfare and military skills.
    What is particularly admirable is that our commanders and fighters have brought their high degree of wisdom and creativity into play, and with their diligent hands, completed the construction of deep tunnel fortifications on the Korean front. Relying on these strong fortifications, our army can advance to attack and retreat to defend. Even if the enemy occupies the hilltop, our army can continue to fight in the tunnels, cooperate with the counter-attacking troops to annihilate the enemy, and recapture the hilltop. The enemy called our army's tunnel fortifications "underground cities," "crisscrossing most of the mountains, with many tunnels and passages connecting many hillsides to transport military supplies and reinforcements without worrying about the Allied bombing." In the face of our army's strong tunnel fortifications, the crazy enemy had to admit that they had no way to deal with it. A United Press reporter admitted that the US military wanted to risk our army's powerful firepower to cross our army's strong fortifications and advance, "the blunt answer is that it can't be done."
    In such an unprecedented war, our army's logistics work has also been done very well. In the past two years, thanks to the selfless efforts of all logistics personnel, overcoming the enemy's bombing and sabotage and the difficulties of natural conditions, a strong logistics force has been established, enabling a large amount of military supplies to be supplied to the front line. When the Battle of Shangganling began, enemy planes frantically bombed our transportation lines, and more than 1,000 bombs were dropped in one transportation area. However, our army's motor transport troops still bravely drove over the rugged mountain roads, breaking through the bombing and threats of enemy planes and artillery, and delivered a large amount of ammunition to the position. When the bridge was blown up, the engineers immediately jumped into the biting cold water to repair the bridge, allowing the cars to pass through like a torrent. In this way, it was ensured that our front-line troops not only had sufficient weapons and ammunition, but also had sufficient cultural and recreational supplies; the enemy had to admit that the attempt to destroy our army's transportation lines had failed. The enemy had to admit that our army had "unlimited ammunition" and frequently fired "particularly fierce artillery fire" at them, "repeatedly paralyzing the Allied infantry operations."
    Of course, the victory of the Battle of Shangganling is inseparable from the active support of the people of our country and the Korean people. In particular, the Korean people, after the battle in the Shangganling area began, the labor party members in the nearby areas led the farmers to organize stretcher teams to rush to the front line, cross the enemy's artillery fire blockade line, and cross the high mountains and ridges to carry the wounded to the field hospitals. Many women braved the cold wind to set up tea stations on the road to the front line. The enthusiastic support of the Korean people gave the commanders and fighters on the front line great encouragement, enabling them to fight the invading enemy more bravely in the battle.
    Now the Battle of Shangganling is still continuing, and we must develop the glorious victory of the Battle of Shangganling and make the enemy continue to suffer heavier losses. An Associated Press dispatch on November 2 admitted: "The casualties and ammunition consumed by the Allied forces have shocked the Allied commanders. And when the full loss is finally announced, it will also shock the public. This three-week battle was the second battle in the 28-month Korean War that resulted in the most casualties of elite troops, second only to the Eighth Army's disastrous defeat in North Korea in 1950." However, we want to tell the American aggressors: if you continue to take risks, you will surely suffer greater losses.
    Dear commanders and fighters of the Korean and Chinese People's Army on the Shangganling front! The victorious battle you have fought with unparalleled bravery and tenacity has not only annihilated a large number of enemy troops, but also inflicted a serious blow on the American aggressors politically. When the United States unreasonably announced the "indefinite adjournment" of the Korean armistice negotiations and insisted on the absurd proposition of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and at the same time attempted to use the United Nations General Assembly to extort more cannon fodder from its vassal states to expand the war of aggression, your victory has a special and significant meaning. You must make persistent efforts to crush the enemy's new offensive.
    Comrades commanders and fighters of the Korean and Chinese forces on the Korean front! Although the enemy has suffered a heavy blow, they have not restrained their ambition for aggression. Eisenhower's visit to Korea has plotted new conspiracies. You must always be vigilant, continue to carry forward the spirit of the Battle of Shangganling, conscientiously sum up combat experience, strive to improve your military and political level, improve your combat effectiveness, and fight to the end for the victorious end of the Korean War. We uphold peace, and we want to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis; but if the enemy insists on risking expanding the war of aggression, we must give them a heavier blow. The people of China and Korea are supporting you with all their strength, and peace-loving people all over the world are supporting you. Victory belongs to you.

### 祝贺上甘岭前线我军的伟大胜利

    祝贺上甘岭前线我军的伟大胜利
    侵朝美军在金化以北上甘岭发动的自吹为“一年来最猛烈的攻势”，已经被英勇的朝中人民军队彻底击碎了。我军在上甘岭一个半月的战斗中，歼灭了敌军二万五千多名，缴获和消耗了敌人大批军用物资。我们谨向上甘岭战斗中牺牲的烈士们致永恒的悼念，谨向上甘岭前线的英雄部队和战斗英雄们致崇高的敬礼。
    上甘岭的战斗，虽然仅仅是一个很狭小的阵地上的战斗，但它的激烈程度与我军的勇敢顽强，是世界战史上少有的。敌人为着争夺面积不过三平方公里的几个山头，投入了两个多师的步兵、一百多辆坦克和第八军的炮兵总预备队。每天发射的炮弹平均二万四千多发，最多的一昼夜将近三十万发；每天平均出动飞机六十三架次，最多的一天曾达二百五十多架次，投掷重磅炸弹五百多枚和许多凝固汽油弹；坦克每天出动三十辆至七十辆，进行摧毁性的射击。这样多的钢铁不断倾泻在这样狭小的阵地上，使山头被削低了两公尺，山上的岩石被炸成一尺多厚的黑色粉末碎石，许多坚石坑道被打短了三四公尺。为着攻击一个山头，敌人常常使用四五个营的兵力进行集团反复冲锋，有时一天攻击二三十次。但是，就在敌人这样疯狂、残酷的攻击下面，打了一个多月，我们英勇顽强的朝中部队不但像无敌的巨人似地依然坚守着阵地，而且还大量歼灭了敌人，不断进行机动的出击；敌人付出了死伤二万五千多人和毁伤飞机二百多架的代价，却一步也不能前进。
    朝中人民部队在这次上甘岭战役中，以无比英勇顽强的战斗，创造了伟大的胜利战绩，这对于全世界人民反对美国侵略保卫世界和平的事业，无疑地是一个巨大的贡献。
    在上甘岭战斗中，朝中部队那种旺盛的士气，英勇的精神，高度的智慧，正是人民军队本色的生动的表现。董存瑞式和马特洛索夫式的英雄大批涌现在朝鲜前线。排长孙占元，两条腿被打断了，仍继续指挥战斗，夺取了敌人的阵地；在打退敌人反扑时，他一个人打两挺机枪，最后子弹打完，拉开手榴弹滚入敌人群中。一个营部通讯员黄继光，为了扫除我军前进途中的障碍，用身体堵住敌人的机枪，并用手雷消灭了敌人的另外两挺机枪。机枪手陈治国用自己的身体当机枪射击台以掩护战友打败敌人。一位电话员临牺牲时还用双手捏住电线，保持前沿阵地与指挥机关的联系。我军英雄们的这种惊天动地的无畏精神，将永远记在全世界爱好和平人民的心中。
    两年来我军指战员在实战中积累了丰富的战斗经验。他们向武装到牙齿的最野蛮最残忍的美国侵略军作战，学会了步兵、炮兵以及其他各兵种联合作战的本领，使我们不断地支援他们的武器，在他们手里发挥了最大的效力。敌人也不得不承认：“在金化地区战场上，中国军队大炮炮火的猛烈集中，已开始在整个战斗中占优势”，并且不能不承认美国侵略军自己和李承晚匪军所以遭受了悲惨的失败，“是因为中国大炮发挥了惊人的作用”。不仅如此，他们还学会了阵地的攻坚战和守备战，做到了攻无不克，守无不固，已经锻炼成为能够掌握现代战争规律和军事技巧的一支强大的武装。
    特别使人叹服的奇迹是我军指战员发挥了高度的智慧和创造性，凭着勤劳的双手，完成了朝鲜前线纵深的坑道工事建筑。依托这些强固的工事，我军就能进可以攻，退可以守。即使敌人占领了山头，我军还可以继续在坑道内坚持战斗，配合反攻部队歼灭敌人，夺回山头。敌人称我军的坑道工事为“地下城市”，“在山中大部分地方纵横交错，并且有许多地道和通道把许多山坡联接起来，以便运输军用品和援军，而无需顾虑联军的轰击”。在我军这样强固的坑道工事面前，疯狂的敌人也不得不自认毫无办法。合众社记者承认美军想要冒着我军强大的火力冲过我军的强固工事向前进攻，“干脆的回答是办不到”。
    在这样史无前例的战争中，我军的后勤工作也做得十分出色。两年来，由于全体后勤人员奋不顾身的努力，冲破了敌人的轰炸破坏与自然条件的困难，建立了强大的后勤部队，使大量的军火物资能够源源供应前线。当上甘岭战斗开始后，敌机疯狂轰炸我运输线，某运输地区曾一次落弹一千多枚。但我军汽车运输部队仍然英勇地驰过崎岖的山道，冲破敌机敌炮的轰击与威胁，把大量弹药送到阵地。桥被炸断了，工兵们马上跳下刺骨的寒水里把桥修好，让汽车像洪流一样地通过。就这样，保证了我前线的部队不但有充裕的武器弹药，而且还有充裕的文化娱乐用品；使敌人不得不自认破坏我军运输线的企图是失败了。敌人不得不承认我军有“无限的弹药”经常向他们发射“特别猛烈的炮火”“一再使联军的步兵作战陷于瘫痪”。
    当然，上甘岭战斗的胜利，和我国人民及朝鲜人民的积极支援是分不开的。特别是朝鲜人民，在上甘岭地区战斗开始后，附近地区的劳动党员领导着农民组织担架队赶赴前线，穿过敌人炮火的封锁线，翻过高山峻岭，把伤员抬到野战医院。许多妇女冒着寒风在通达前线的路上设置茶水站。朝鲜人民的热情支援，给前线指战员以极大的鼓舞，使他们在战斗中更加英勇打击进犯的敌军。
    现在上甘岭的战斗还在继续，我们必须发展上甘岭战斗光辉胜利的战果，使敌人继续遭受更惨重的损失。美联社十一月二日发出的消息已经承认：“联军所牺牲的人和所消耗的军火，已使联军的司令官们震惊了。而且若在最后公布全部损失时，还将使公众震惊。这三星期的战斗是二十八个月的朝鲜战争中第二次损失精锐部队最多的战斗，这次损失仅次于一九五○年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失。”但是，我们要告诉美国侵略者：如果你们继续冒险下去，你们就一定要遭受更大的损失。
    亲爱的上甘岭前线的朝中人民军队的指战员同志们！你们以无比英勇顽强的精神所进行的胜利战斗，不但大量歼灭了敌人的有生力量，而且使美国侵略者在政治上遭受了严重的打击。当美国一面无理宣布朝鲜停战谈判“无限期休会”，并坚持强迫扣留战俘的荒谬主张，一面又企图利用联合国大会向它的仆从国家勒索更多的炮灰来扩大侵略战争的时候，你们的胜利更具有特殊重大的意义。你们要再接再厉，粉碎敌人的新的进攻。
    朝鲜前线朝中部队全体指战员同志们！现在敌人虽然受了沉重的打击，但还没有收敛他们的侵略野心。艾森豪威尔的朝鲜之行已策划了新的阴谋，你们要时时刻刻提高警惕性，继续发扬在上甘岭战斗中的精神，认真总结战斗经验，努力提高自己的军事、政治水平，提高自己的战斗力，为争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束而战斗到底。我们拥护和平，我们要争取在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题；但如果敌人硬要冒险扩大侵略战争，我们就一定要给他们更沉重的打击。朝中两国人民都在全力支持你们，全世界爱好和平的人们也都在支持你们，胜利是属于你们的。
