Northwest Yumen Oil Mine recently inspected its basic construction work for the year and summarized its experiences in basic construction over the past three years. Over the past three years, Yumen Oil Mine has been simultaneously improving and increasing production and carrying out considerable basic construction in major engineering departments such as drilling, oil extraction, and refining, as well as auxiliary engineering departments such as machinery, construction, and water and electricity supply. Except for drilling projects, all projects were completed on schedule. The most complex refining project achieved particularly outstanding results. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers of Yumen Oil Mine fully utilized their initiative, implemented strict organizational division of labor, and collected scattered waste and old materials. They completed the construction of the Dabus cracking refinery, which used to take two years, in just over four months. Recently, Yumen Oil Mine also designed, manufactured, and installed a diesel cold-pressing dewaxing plant, which is a significant victory for China's refining industry. In addition, new machinery plants, new power plants, etc., have also been built. According to recent preliminary inspections, over 94% of the annual construction workload can be completed by the end of 1952.

Over the past three years, many shortcomings have also occurred in the basic construction work of Yumen Oil Mine. In 1951, the production capacity of existing oil wells was already more than sufficient, but four more production wells were drilled, resulting in an accumulation of over 10 billion yuan in capital. Some projects underwent too much rework; the expansion of the centrifugal dewaxing plant and the cold-pressing dewaxing plant involved as many as seventeen reworks. The quality of some projects was very poor; the pipeline system of the cold-pressing dewaxing plant leaked oil before reaching a certain pressure during the oil testing phase. The phenomenon of work stoppages due to material shortages and unqualified materials was also quite serious. The new machinery plant and the new power plant, among others, could not be completed early because they were waiting for materials ordered from Shanghai.

The reasons for these phenomena are primarily due to the lack of thorough geological surveys, which meant that basic construction plans lacked a basis, resulting in constant changes to the plans and severely affecting the smooth progress of the drilling plan. Secondly, the design could not keep up with the construction, and the vast majority of projects were designed and constructed simultaneously, sometimes even without blueprints, which often led to rework. Furthermore, the division of responsibility for the management of Yumen Oil Mine's basic construction between the Northwest Petroleum Administration and the Yumen Mining Bureau was not unified, and the construction units could not independently account for costs, making it impossible to calculate precise costs, which also had a significant impact on construction projects.

In order to improve basic construction work, preparations are now underway to establish a basic construction department for the entire mine to uniformly lead and centrally manage the basic construction work of Yumen Oil Mine. A petroleum installation engineering company will also be established to put construction units on the path of enterprise management, implement an economic accounting system, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and improve work efficiency to meet the needs of the country's large-scale construction in the future.

    西北玉门油矿总结基本建设工作经验
    准备建立专门机构加强对基本建设工作的领导
    西北玉门油矿最近检查了本年的基本建设工作，并总结了三年来基本建设工作的经验。三年来玉门油矿一面改进和提高生产，一面在钻井、采油、炼油等主要工程部门和机械、建筑、水电供应等辅助工程部门，进行了相当规模的基本建设。除钻井工程外，所有工程都按期完成。其中以最复杂的炼油工程的成绩较为突出。解放后，玉门油矿职工在中国共产党领导下，充分发挥了积极性，进行了严密的组织分工，搜集了散落在各地的废料、旧料，以四个多月的时间，就完成了过去需要两年才能装建成功的达布斯裂炼厂。最近玉门油矿又设计、制造和装建了柴油冷榨去蜡厂，这是中国炼油工业的一项重大的胜利。此外，还建设了新机厂、新电厂等。据最近初步检查，一九五二年年底可完成全年建设工程量百分之九十四以上。
    三年来，在玉门油矿的基本建设工作中，也曾发生不少缺点。一九五一年原有油井的生产能力本已有余，却又钻生产井四口，积压资金一百多亿元。有的工程返工太多，在扩充离心去蜡厂和冷榨去腊厂的工程中竟返工十七次。有些工程质量很差，冷榨去蜡厂管线系统在试油时，没有达到一定压力就漏油。停工待料和器材质量不合规格的现象也相当严重，新机厂和新电厂等都因为等待在上海订购的器材而不能及早完工。
    产生这些现象的原因，首先是由于没有做好地质调查工作，使得基本建设计划没有依据，结果计划一变再变，严重地影响了钻井计划的顺利进行。其次是设计赶不上施工，绝大多数工程是一面设计一面施工，有时甚至是没有蓝图就施工，因而常常返工。再次，由于西北石油管理局和玉门矿务局分段掌握玉门油矿基本建设的经营管理工作不统一，施工单位不能独立核算，算不出精确成本，对建设工程的影响也很大。
    为了改进基本建设工作，现已准备设立一个全矿的基本建设处，来统一领导和集中管理玉门油矿的基本建设工作，并成立石油装建工程公司，使施工单位走上企业化的道路，实行经济核算制，学习苏联先进经验，提高工作效率，以适应国家今后大规模建设的需要。
