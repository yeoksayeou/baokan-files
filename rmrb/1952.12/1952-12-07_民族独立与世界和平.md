    National Independence and World Peace
    By Dr. Le Dinh Tham,
    Head of the Vietnamese Delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    In order to bring maximum profits to monopoly capital groups, imperialists not only cruelly oppress and exploit their own people, but also use every means to infringe upon the independence of other nations, thereby oppressing and exploiting the people of weaker countries. They use means such as buying off, deceiving, threatening, and directly or indirectly carrying out armed intervention to invade various countries in culture, society, economy, politics, and military affairs, gradually turning these countries into their dependencies, exclusive markets, and cheap raw material supply bases. The result of this aggression is that the lives of the people of various countries become increasingly difficult and painful, forcing the people of various countries to rise up against them. In order to maintain the unreasonable rights of the monopolists, they use all kinds of inhuman forms to carry out barbaric armed suppression of the people, such as torture, electrocution, dismemberment, abdominal incision, live burial, etc., and even women and children suffer the same torture. This is a very cruel form of war that is constantly occurring in colonial countries.
    In order to oppress the people, compete for raw materials, markets, and colonies in order to seize greater profits, wars have broken out several times between imperialist countries. War makes the people suffer and be subjected to large-scale massacres. Imperialists do not hesitate to provoke wars, because war is the best opportunity for monopoly capital groups to make a fortune. Because of the above reasons, the issue of national independence is closely related to world peace.
    Also for this reason, the world peace movement has always advocated respecting the independence of all nations, and that no country should interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Because of such advocacy, the peace movement, with the Soviet Union and China as its great pillars, has developed rapidly and grown stronger.
    According to the current situation, the issue of national independence should be raised more specifically before the peace-loving people of the world.
    At present, except for the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the independent sovereignty of other countries has been more or less violated by the American imperialists.
    Needless to say, those countries that are suffering from armed aggression and are fighting for independence, and those colonial countries that are being trampled by colonial troops, even those countries that claim to be independent are suffering from American imperialist aggression in culture, society, economy, politics, and even military affairs. The British imperialists, who call themselves strong countries, are also occupied by American troops; because a foreign army stationed on the territory of another country in peacetime, not subject to the jurisdiction of that country's government, and enjoying judicial, military, and other privileges, is actually an occupying army.
    The American occupation forces also force the people of various countries to bear part of the military expenses. They use the privilege of supplying the army to freely engage in smuggling, and the customs of various countries have no right to inspect them. Although the American imperialists and their lackeys use various agreements, "worldism," "supranational regimes," and other tricks to cover up, in reality, the independent sovereignty of various countries is constantly being infringed upon by the American imperialists. Therefore, the issue of defending national independence should be raised more specifically before the people of the world.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was the first to have the honor of specifically raising this issue. The resolution of the conference not only clearly stated what true independence is, and who is infringing upon the independence of various nations, but also put forward specific methods for defending the independence of various nations.
    The preparatory committee for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna has also raised the issue of how to ensure the independence of all nations and the security of all countries in the agenda of the congress.
    This proves that the people of all countries who are oppressed and exploited by the imperialists are very concerned about the issue of national independence.
    The people of the world have clearly realized that lasting peace can only be achieved when national independence is guaranteed, that is, only when we can eliminate the aggressive intentions of the imperialists.
    The Vietnamese people are very happy and excited about the success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna, and fully agree with the various issues raised by the preparatory committee of the congress in the agenda. The delegation elected by the Vietnamese people to participate in the congress is willing to work with representatives of all countries, unite the people of the world, and fight for independence, freedom, and peace.
    The Vietnamese people are willing to unite with the brotherly people of Laos and Cambodia, unite with the people of the Soviet Union, unite with the people of China and the People's Democratic countries, unite with the peace-loving people of the world (including the French people), and under the wise leadership of President Ho, more actively unite the people of the whole country, conduct a production increase and economy practice competition, and an enemy annihilation competition, to celebrate the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna, and contribute our share to opposing imperialist war provocateurs and defending national independence and world peace.
    Peace will surely defeat violence,
    The Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian resistance war will surely be victorious.

    民族独立与世界和平
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平
    会议越南代表团团长黎廷探博士
    为了给垄断资本集团带来最大的利润，帝国主义者不仅残酷地压迫和剥削本国人民，还用尽一切办法侵犯其他民族的独立，借以压迫和剥削各弱小国家的人民。他们用收买、欺骗、威胁、直接或间接进行武装干涉等手段，在文化、社会、经济、政治、军事各方面侵略各国，逐一把这些国家变成他们的属地、独占市场、廉价的原料供给地。这种侵略的结果，便是各国人民的生活日益困难和痛苦，迫使各国人民起来反抗他们。为了维护垄断资本家的不合理的权利，他们用各种最无人道的形式对人民进行野蛮的武力镇压，例如拷打、电刑、活剐、剖腹、活埋等等，连妇女和儿童也遭受同样的酷刑。这是在各殖民地国家内不断发生的一种非常残酷的战争形式。
    为了压迫人民，争夺原料、市场，争夺殖民地以便攫取更大的利润，帝国主义国家之间曾几次爆发战争。战争使人民痛苦、遭受大规模屠杀。帝国主义者不惜挑拨战争，因为战争是垄断资本集团发大财的最好机会。由于上述的原因，所以民族独立问题与世界和平有着密切关系。
    也因为这个原因，世界保卫和平运动一向主张尊重各民族的独立，任何国家都不能干涉别国的内政。由于这样的主张，以苏联和中国为伟大支柱的和平运动，获得迅速发展并日益壮大。
    根据目前的形势，民族独立问题更应在世界爱好和平的人民面前提出来。
    目前，除了苏联和东欧各人民民主国家之外，其他各国的独立主权，都或多或少地被美帝国主义者侵犯。
    不用说那些遭受武装侵略正在进行战斗以争取独立的国家，和那些正在被殖民军队所践踏的殖民地国家，就连那些号称独立的国家也正在遭受美帝国主义者在文化、社会、经济、政治甚至军事方面的侵略。自命为强国的英帝国主义，也被美国军队占领；因为一支外国军队在和平时期驻扎在另一个国家的领土上，不受该国政府的管辖，享有裁判、军事等特权，实际上它就是一支占领军。
    美国占领军还强迫各国人民负担一部分军费。他们利用供应军队的特权，自由走私，各国海关也无权检查他们。尽管美帝国主义者及其走狗用各种协定、“世界主义”、“超国家政权”等等花样作掩饰，实际上各国的独立主权仍是不断地受到美帝国主义者的侵犯。因此，保卫民族独立问题更应在世界人民面前具体地提出来。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议最先获得具体提出这一问题的荣誉。会议的决议不仅明确地说明了怎样才是真正的独立，说明了谁侵犯各民族的独立，并且还提出了保卫各民族独立的具体方法。
    即将在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会的筹备委员会，在大会的议程中，也提出了怎样保证各民族独立和各国安全的问题。
    这证明了被帝国主义者压迫和剥削的各国人民是很关心民族独立问题的。
    世界人民已经清楚地认识了，只有当民族独立获得保证的时候，也就是说，只有当我们能够消灭帝国主义者的侵略意图的时候，持久和平才能实现。
    越南人民对于在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功十分欢欣兴奋。越南人民热烈欢迎即将在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，并且完全赞成大会筹备委员会在议程中所提出的各项问题。越南人民所推选参加大会的代表团愿与各国代表共同努力，团结世界人民，为独立、自由、和平而斗争。
    越南人民愿与寮国、高棉的兄弟人民团结，与苏联人民团结，与中国和各人民民主国家的人民团结，与世界爱好和平的人民（包括法国人民）团结，并在胡主席的英明领导下，更积极地团结全国人民，进行增产节约竞赛、歼灭敌人竞赛，以庆贺维也纳的世界人民和平大会，为反对帝国主义战争挑拨者，保卫民族独立与世界和平贡献我们的一份力量。
    和平一定战胜暴力，
    越棉寮抗战一定胜利。
