Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 29th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of November 26th to continue discussing the Indian proposal regarding the repatriation of Korean prisoners of war.

All the representatives of the US-British bloc who spoke at the meeting carefully avoided mentioning the Soviet proposal on a ceasefire in Korea, or only spoke empty words about the main tasks of the United Nations, and made slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union.

They all praised the Indian proposal. As everyone knows, the Indian proposal merely repeats the key points of the notorious American proposal. It should be pointed out that the Indian proposal was also supported by the Kuomintang delegate. The Kuomintang delegate said that his delegation was satisfied with the Indian proposal and that the Indian delegation had made a contribution to the Political Committee. The Kuomintang element’s speech clearly demonstrated who needed the Indian proposal and who supported it.

The Ethiopian representative said that the reason he supported the Indian proposal was precisely because it included "all the basic principles" of the American proposal – which had the Ethiopian representative's signature on it.

Following the previous speakers was the head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Mrs. Sekaninova. She said that although the Indian proposal mentioned the Geneva Convention, it violated the principles of this convention, which stipulates the immediate and unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war after the end of the war. In this regard, the Indian proposal followed the notorious American principle of "voluntary repatriation," that is, the Indian proposal agreed to forced "screening" and "interrogation" of prisoners of war, and agreed to the continued barbaric treatment of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the US military command.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation emphasized that the Indian proposal, as well as the US, Peruvian, and Mexican proposals, did not mention the necessity of an immediate ceasefire in Korea. Sekaninova said that only the Soviet proposal and the Soviet amendment to the Indian proposal stipulated an immediate cessation of combat operations in Korea. The Czechoslovak delegation supports the Soviet delegation's amendment to the Indian proposal. This amendment corrects and supplements the Indian proposal, making it an effective tool for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the speedy end to the Korean War.

The Dutch representative, Mr. Baruch, spoke next. He supported the Indian proposal and suggested that it be amended according to the opinions of "certain delegations," in other words, according to the opinions of the US and British delegations.

At the end of the meeting, Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski spoke. He pointed out that the Political Committee's discussion on the Korean issue shows that the continuation of the Korean War is a threat to world peace and hinders the development of peaceful international relations and peaceful cooperation. The Polish representative said: At the same time, this discussion also shows that the US delegation is trying its best to prevent the General Assembly from reaching a constructive solution to the Korean issue. The United States is only interested in maintaining and continuing the Korean War – a basic element of its foreign policy.

Skrzeszewski pointed out that the Polish delegation believes that among all the proposals, only the Soviet proposal and the Soviet amendment to the Indian proposal can lead to the termination of armed conflict and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and provide all guarantees that Korea can establish lasting peace, so that the Korean people can truly obtain the right to decide their own destiny.

In criticizing the Indian proposal, Skrzeszewski said that the Indian proposal does not take into account the interests of the Korean people who are fighting for independence, and therefore it will not contribute to the cause of peace in the Far East. The Polish representative pointed out the importance of the Soviet amendment to the Indian proposal, and emphasized that: adopting these amendments can change the nature of the Indian proposal and make it a tool for ending the Korean War. He asked everyone to pay special attention to the fact that the Soviet amendment puts the immediate cessation of conflict in all three areas of land, sea, and air first and foremost. Skrzeszewski said that the Soviet amendment suggests establishing an authoritative committee to decide on the issue of prisoners of war. The Soviet amendment provides a guarantee that the issue of prisoners of war can be resolved in the shortest possible time in accordance with the principles of current international law. The head of the Polish delegation emphasized that the Soviet amendment not only wants to solve the issue of prisoners of war, which is just one aspect of the entire Korean issue. The purpose of the Soviet amendment is to end the Korean War, unify Korea, and establish a unified democratic state by the Korean people themselves under the supervision of the United Nations.

Skrzeszewski concluded by saying that the Polish delegation fully supports the Soviet amendment to the Indian proposal. The United Nations has a responsibility to give full support to these proposals that guarantee a resolution of the Korean issue in the spirit of national self-determination and international peace.

    美英集团代表在联大政委会上吹嘘印度提案
    捷波代表支持苏联对印度提案的修正案
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十一月二十六日下午举行会议，继续讨论关于遣返朝鲜战俘的印度提案。
    所有在会上发言的美英集团代表，都小心翼翼地避免提起关于在朝鲜停火的苏联提案，或者是只谈些关于联合国主要任务的空洞词句，对苏联进行诽谤性的攻击。
    他们都赞扬印度提案。大家知道，印度提案不过是重复了臭名远扬的美国提案里的要点。应该指出，印度提案也得到国民党代理人的支持。国民党代理人说，他的代表团对印度提案感到满意，又说，印度代表团对政治委员会有了贡献。国民党分子的发言明白地说明了谁需要印度提案，谁支持印度提案。
    阿比西尼亚代表说，他之所以支持印度提案，正是因为其中包括了美国提案——上面有阿比西尼亚代表的签名——的“全部基本原则”。
    继起发言的是捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃。她说，虽然印度提案提到日内瓦公约，但是，它却违反了这个公约的原则，这个公约规定：在战争结束以后立刻无条件地遣返全部战俘。在这一方面，印度提案追随了臭名昭著的美国“自愿遣返”原则，也就是说，印度提案同意强迫“甄别”和
    “询问”战俘，同意美军司令部继续野蛮地对待朝中战俘。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长强调说，印度提案以及美国、秘鲁和墨西哥提案中都只字没有提到在朝鲜立即停战的必要性。塞卡尼诺娃说，只有苏联提案与苏联对印度提案的修正案中规定了立即停止在朝鲜的战斗行动。捷克斯洛伐克代表团支持苏联代表团对印度提案的修正案。这个修正案纠正与补充了印度提案，使它能成为和平解决朝鲜问题与尽速结束朝鲜战争的有效工具。
    荷兰代表巴鲁赛克继起发言。他支持印度提案，建议按照“某些代表团”的意见加以修改，换句话说，也就是按照美英代表团的意见加以修改。
    在会议结束时，波兰外交部长斯克列杰夫斯基发言。他指出，政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论表明：朝鲜战争的继续，对世界和平是一个威胁，并且妨碍国际和平关系与和平合作的发展。波兰代表说：同时，这次讨论也表明：美国代表团正竭力阻挠大会获致一个建设性的解决朝鲜问题的办法。美国只是对维持和继续朝鲜战争——它的外交政策的一个基本要素——感兴趣。
    斯克列杰夫斯基指出：波兰代表团认为：在所有的提案中，只有苏联的提案和苏联对印度提案的修正案，能够导致武装冲突的终止和朝鲜问题的和平解决，并提供一切保证，使朝鲜得以建立持久和平，使朝鲜人民真能获得决定他们自己的命运的权利。
    斯克列杰夫斯基在批评印度的提案时说，印度提案没有考虑到正在为独立而斗争的朝鲜人民的利益，因此它对于远东的和平事业不会有什么贡献。波兰代表指出苏联对印度提案提出的修正案的重要性，并强调说：采纳这些修正案便可改变印度提案的性质，使它成为结束朝鲜战争的工具。他请大家特别注意这样一个事实，即：苏联的修正案把双方立即停止陆、海、空三方面的冲突这一点放在最前面。斯克列杰夫斯基说：苏联的修正案建议成立一个权威的委员会，以决定战俘问题。苏联的修正案提供一个保证，使战俘问题得以在最短期间依据现行国际法的原则解决。波兰代表团团长强调指出：苏联的修正案不仅要解决战俘问题，战俘问题不过是整个朝鲜问题的一方面。苏联的修正案的目的在于结束朝鲜战争，统一朝鲜，并在联合国的监督下由朝鲜人民自己建立一个统一的民主国家。
    斯克列杰夫斯基最后说：波兰代表团完全赞成苏联对印度提案的修正案。联合国有责任对这些保证朝鲜问题在民族自决与国际和平的精神下获得解决的建议，给予充分的支持。
