    The Contradictions and Difficulties of the North Atlantic Aggression Bloc Are Insurmountable

    The North Atlantic Aggression Bloc recently held a council meeting in Paris. This meeting was held under circumstances in which the North Atlantic Aggression Bloc's arms expansion and war preparations plan had suffered major setbacks, and the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries were becoming increasingly acute. The results of the meeting once again proved that the internal difficulties and contradictions of the North Atlantic Aggression Bloc are impossible to eliminate.

    The United States' coercion of Western European countries to expand arms and prepare for war has brought about a serious economic crisis in various countries, which has aroused strong opposition from the people of those countries. Britain has been forced to cut its war preparations plan, France has openly stated that it will slow down the pace of arms expansion, and other Western European countries are even more willing but lack the strength. They have all requested amendments to the arms expansion plan adopted at the Lisbon Conference in February of this year. At this meeting, the United States also wanted to increase pressure to urge various countries to accelerate arms expansion, but it was resisted by various countries. Therefore, the meeting had to decide to abandon the plan stipulated by the Lisbon Conference to establish seventy-five divisions by the end of next year and ninety-six divisions by the end of 1954. The United States was naturally greatly disappointed with such a resolution, but it could not come up with a solution to the serious political and economic crises in Western European countries, so it had to agree to reduce the arms expansion plan and use the slogan of "emphasis on quality rather than quantity" to cover up the failure of the war preparations plan.

    The contradictions between the United States and the North Atlantic countries are also reflected in the disputes caused by the military base construction plan. The United States attempted to further turn Western Europe into its base for aggression and, at this meeting, put forward a plan to force various countries to accelerate the construction of military bases. However, the exhausted Western European countries were unwilling to bear the huge construction costs, and they cut the number requested by the United States by nearly half, despite the opposition of the United States.

    The phenomenon of the North Atlantic Aggression Bloc disintegrating is becoming more and more obvious. However, do not think that the United States will give up its sinister attempt to use it as a tool of aggression. The United States is still trying to strengthen its control over the North Atlantic Aggression Bloc and mend its rifts. The resolution passed at this council meeting under the pressure of the United States, that North Atlantic countries should do their best to assist France in its war of aggression in Vietnam, is proof of this. This approach, on the one hand, is to try to reconcile the contradictions between the United States and France, so that France can more actively engage in arms expansion and war preparations; on the other hand, it is intended to pave the way for the United States to further directly intervene in and expand the Vietnam War. This conspiracy of the United States must arouse the vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world.

### 北大西洋侵略集团的矛盾和困难是不可克服的

    北大西洋侵略集团的矛盾和困难是不可克服的
    北大西洋侵略集团最近在巴黎举行了理事会会议。这个会议是在北大西洋侵略集团扩军备战计划遭到重大挫折、美国与西欧各国矛盾日趋尖锐的情况下举行的。会议的结果又一次证明：北大西洋侵略集团内部的困难和矛盾是无法消除的。
    美国胁迫西欧各国进行扩军备战，给各国带来了严重的经济危机，引起了各国人民的强烈反对。英国已被迫削减了备战计划，法国公开表示要放慢扩军的步伐，其他西欧国家更是心有余而力不足。它们纷纷要求修改今年二月里斯本会议所通过的扩军计划。在这一次的会议上，美国还想加强压力催促各国加速扩军，但却遭到各国的抗拒。因此，会议不得不决定放弃里斯本会议所规定在明年底建立七十五个师和到一九五四年底建立九十六个师的计划。美国对于这样的决议自然大感失望，但是它对西欧各国严重的政治和经济危机，又拿不出解决的办法，只好同意削减扩军计划，而以“重质不重量”的口号来掩饰备战计划的失败。
    美国与北大西洋各国的矛盾也同样反映在修建军事基地计划所引起的争执上面。美国企图进一步把西欧变成它的侵略基地，在这次会议上提出了迫使各国加速修建军事基地的计划。但是精疲力竭的西欧国家都不愿承担巨额的修建费用，它们不顾美国的反对，把美国要求的数目削减了将近一半。
    北大西洋侵略集团分崩离析的现象愈来愈明显了。但是，不要以为美国会就此放弃利用它作为侵略工具的罪恶图谋。美国还正在力图加强对北大西洋侵略集团的控制和弥补它的裂痕。这一次理事会会议在美国的压力下，通过了北大西洋国家尽力援助法国在越南进行侵略战争的决议，便是一个证明。这种做法，一方面是为了想调和美国与法国之间的矛盾，使法国更积极地从事扩军备战；另一方面是打算为美国进一步直接干涉和扩大越南战争开辟道路。美国的这个阴谋，必须引起全世界爱好和平人民的警惕。
