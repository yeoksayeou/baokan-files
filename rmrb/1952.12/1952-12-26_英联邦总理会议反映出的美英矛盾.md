    The Contradictions Between the US and Britain Reflected in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference
    Tan Wenrui
    The Commonwealth Prime Ministers recently held a conference in London to discuss issues related to the Commonwealth's finances, trade, and economic development. Britain originally intended to strengthen the Commonwealth's economic chain through this conference to counter the US's expansionist policies. However, the outcome of the conference did not meet the wishes of the Churchill government. On many major issues, there were significant differences among the Commonwealth countries. These differences are a reflection of the US's influence penetrating the Commonwealth. This situation fully illustrates that the contradictions between the US and Britain have become increasingly acute.
    The Struggle for Markets
    One of the main issues discussed and fiercely debated at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was the issue of the Imperial Preference System. Britain advocated expanding the preferential tariff system within the Empire to further prevent foreign goods (mainly American goods) from entering the Commonwealth market. However, countries such as Canada and Australia not only opposed expanding it but also hoped to weaken this system, while demanding the removal of import restrictions by Commonwealth countries.
    After the First World War, Britain's economy began to decline. The continuously expanding American economic power not only squeezed Britain in the capitalist world market but also increasingly encroached on the Commonwealth's territory. During the severe capitalist economic crisis in 1932, Britain convened an Imperial Conference in Ottawa to discuss ways to deal with the crisis, resulting in the formulation of the Imperial Preference System as a weapon to defend against American economic attacks. For twenty years, Britain has relied on this magic weapon to resist American attacks on the Commonwealth's commodity market. The United States, on the other hand, has continuously tried to weaken and dismantle this British armament. The United States has used the Anglo-American Financial Agreement, the Marshall Plan, and various international tariff and trade conferences to pressure Britain to relax the Imperial Preference System, reduce tariffs on American goods entering the country, and facilitate the dumping of American goods into the sterling area. In recent years, US exports to India have increased by one and a half times, and exports to the Union of South Africa have increased by nearly eight times. On the other hand, the United States has used tariff barriers and other methods to prevent British goods from being exported to the United States. From 1940 to 1951, over twelve years, the value of goods sold by the United States to Britain was more than twice the value of goods sold by Britain to the United States. Therefore, in recent times, Britain, which has always had a trade deficit, has become increasingly unable to make ends meet.
    Since 1913, Britain has relied on profits from overseas investments to make up for its trade deficit. During the Second World War, Britain sold off over 1.1 billion pounds worth of overseas assets and accumulated heavy debts during the war. The annually increasing trade deficit after the war had to be paid by drawing on reserves of gold and dollars, causing a serious "dollar shortage." In order to save the crisis of gold and dollar reserve losses, the British ruling group has repeatedly adopted measures to reduce imports of dollar goods while planning to expand commodity exports to the dollar area. However, the trade deficit for the first nine months of this year still reached 656.7 million pounds, and gold and dollar reserves have not yet reached the "minimum safe level." Therefore, Britain intends to further expand the Imperial Preference System to consolidate its position in competition with the United States, making it more difficult for American goods to be dumped in the sterling area. At the same time, it wants to take this opportunity to ask the United States to lower high tariffs so that more British goods can be shipped to the United States to earn dollars and prevent the further deterioration of the dollar shortage crisis.
    However, some other countries within the Commonwealth have different ideas. Countries such as Canada and Australia, which have already leaned towards the United States, no longer have much interest in the Imperial Preference System. Although they have also benefited from this system, gaining favorable conditions for selling goods within the Commonwealth, the majority of the import and export trade of Canada and Australia has shifted to the United States in recent years. They believe that the Imperial Preference System is just a way to force Commonwealth countries to "buy British goods," which is a major obstacle to expanding trade with the United States. They demand lower tariff barriers and relaxed restrictions on the import of foreign goods, which in effect means opening the doors of the Commonwealth to American goods. Due to the Commonwealth countries having "different dreams in the same bed," Britain's proposal to expand the preferential tariff system within the Empire was rejected at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, while the opposition of Canada, Australia, and other countries to the preferential tariff system was also unsuccessful. The conference decided that Britain could ask the countries participating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva to allow Britain to raise tariffs on certain imported goods. Although whether the United States and other countries will agree to Britain's request is another matter, this resolution of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference fully demonstrates Britain's determination to launch a fierce struggle against the American economic offensive towards the sterling area. Therefore, at the same time, Britain has decided to continue restricting the import of foreign goods.
    The Struggle between the Dollar and the Pound
    Another issue discussed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference—the free convertibility of the pound—is related to the above issue. Some countries of the Commonwealth strongly demanded the restoration of the pound's free convertibility, but Britain argued that it could only be realized after the Commonwealth's payment situation improved and foreign trade expanded. Due to Britain's persistence, the call for the pound's free convertibility was suppressed.
    The sterling area formed by Britain in the 1930s is another weapon it relies on to compete with the United States. The Commonwealth countries (except Canada) and some other countries are included in its financial sphere of influence to compete with the dollar group headed by the United States. Trade between countries in this area is settled in pounds, which gives Britain a privileged position in trading with countries in the sterling area. Britain has always been a country that needs to import large quantities of food and industrial raw materials. The pounds earned by countries in the sterling area from selling food and raw materials to Britain are subject to restrictions when they want to be converted into dollars or other currencies. They must be used to purchase British industrial products. Thus, Britain has guarantees in both purchasing raw materials and promoting products. When some countries export more goods to Britain than they import from Britain, they can only store a sterling debit balance in London, which cannot be converted into dollars that can be used to purchase goods in the dollar area. Britain's exchange control measures have a great resistance to the economic expansion of the United States. Therefore, the United States has been trying to crush the sterling system in order to clear obstacles for it to compete for the Commonwealth and the sterling area market. At the end of 1945, the United States used a loan as bait to make Britain agree to lift exchange controls. In July 1947, Britain fulfilled the conditions of the loan agreement and began to implement free convertibility, immediately losing 250 million pounds of gold and dollars, causing a violent economic storm in Britain. Unable to care about losing face, Britain quickly announced the suspension of free convertibility of the pound, which blocked the big hole in the national treasury. Later, the United States used the "Marshall Plan" to force Britain to agree to the partial circulation of currency, and 25 percent of the debts of various countries in Britain can be freely circulated. However, this concession made by Britain under American pressure failed to satisfy the United States. The United States continues to try every means to undermine the international currency status of the pound, thus forming a struggle between the dollar and the pound. The active demand of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries for the restoration of the pound's free convertibility at this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference reflects the American point of view.
    The demands of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries were put forward under the slogan of expanding free trade. The representatives of these countries directly attacked the restriction of pound exchange as forcing countries to purchase "expensive" and "unsuitable" British goods. They hope to get rid of this restriction in order to further lean towards the United States. But Britain resolutely refused to give in on this issue, because it remembered the storm five years ago and could not help but feel frightened. Now Britain's gold and dollar reserves are still in a dangerous situation, and if free convertibility is implemented, it will lead to economic bankruptcy. Britain has not forgotten the prestige of the pound's free passage in the world in the past, but today's situation is very different. The urgent task before Britain is to save the crisis of dollar shortage, and it is not yet possible to talk about raising the international status of the pound. However, in order to ease the contradictions between the Commonwealth countries, Britain had to agree to relax restrictions on American investment, allowing foreign investors to transfer capital profits, allowing American capital to further invade the British Commonwealth.
    The Struggle for Raw Materials
    The struggle for raw materials among capitalist countries has a long history. After the war, due to the large-scale arms expansion and war preparations by the United States, it massively plundered and hoarded strategic raw materials from foreign countries, and the contradiction with Britain became more acute. A large part of the raw materials that the United States does not produce itself or whose production is insufficient are purchased from the Commonwealth countries. Last year, 32 to 93 percent of the US imports of major raw materials such as rubber, jute, wool, tin, lead, and manganese came from the British Empire market. Britain also relies on its autonomous territories and colonies to export these raw materials in exchange for a considerable amount of dollar income. In the past two years, the United States has used policies such as "blockade and embargo" against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries and "suspension of purchases" and "hoarding" to monopolize the world raw material market and depress the prices of raw materials, causing great losses to Britain. For example, the price of natural rubber in Malaya has fallen by more than 60 percent since December 1950, and the price of Australian wool has fallen by 60 to 70 percent. The US policy of manipulating raw material prices is a serious blow to the British economy. At the beginning of this year, Churchill went to Washington to negotiate with the United States on this issue, but there was not much result. Only an agreement was reached on the tin trade. The United States agreed to pay a fixed price when purchasing tin ore for one year. The situation of other commodities has not improved. On the other hand, the prices of food and industrial raw materials imported by Britain from the dollar area are all controlled by the United States. Therefore, at this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, Britain put forward the slogan of developing federal resources, hoping that the autonomous territories would produce more raw materials to supply Britain's needs and earn dollars from abroad. At the same time, it planned to gather the strength of the Commonwealth countries to ask the United States to sign an agreement to stabilize commodity prices to oppose the US monopoly of raw materials. It is rumored that Churchill is preparing to go to the United States next spring to negotiate and will propose raising the price of gold. We can predict that by then, the economic contradictions between the United States and Britain will be more apparent.
    This Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference on the one hand exposed that the Commonwealth has fallen into disintegration due to the intrusion of American power; on the other hand, it also reflected that under the economic attack of the United States, Britain retreated on one side and tried to hold on to the last position and waited for an opportunity to counterattack. These two capitalist powers are engaged in a life-and-death struggle. Stalin said:
    "The struggle between capitalist countries for markets and their desire to drown their competitors is, in practice, more intense than the contradiction between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp." This is quite right.

    英联邦总理会议反映出的美英矛盾
    谭文瑞
    英联邦各国总理最近曾在伦敦举行会议，讨论有关英联邦财政、贸易和经济发展等问题。英国原企图通过这次会议加强联邦的经济连锁，以对抗美国的扩张政策。但是会议的结果并没有符合邱吉尔政府的愿望。在许多主要问题上，联邦各国都存在着很大的分歧。这些分歧正是美国势力伸入英联邦内部的反映。这种情形充分说明了，美英之间的矛盾已日益尖锐。
    市场的争夺
    英联邦总理会议中曾经讨论并引起剧烈争吵的一个主要问题是关于帝国特惠关税制的问题。英国主张扩大帝国内部的特惠关税制，以便进一步阻止外国商品（主要是美国商品）侵入联邦市场；可是加拿大、澳大利亚等国不但反对扩大而且希望削弱这个制度，同时要求取消联邦国家的进口限制。
    第一次世界大战以后，英国的经济便开始衰退。不断膨胀的美国经济势力，不仅在资本主义世界市场中极力排挤英国，而且日益侵入到英联邦的领域。一九三二年资本主义经济危机严重的时候，英国在渥太华召开过一次帝国会议，商量应付危机的办法，结果制订了帝国特惠关税制，作为防御美国经济进攻的武器。二十年来英国靠着这一件法宝，尽力抗拒美国对英联邦商品市场的进攻。而美国则不断想要削弱和解除英国的这一武装。美国曾经利用英美财政协定、马歇尔计划和历次国际关税及贸易会议，压迫英国放宽帝国特惠制，减低美国货物入口的关税，便利美国货物向英镑地区倾销。近年来，美国对印度的输出增加了一倍半，对南非联邦的输出增加了将近八倍。另一方面，美国又以关税壁垒和其他方法阻止英国货物输往美国，从一九四○到一九五一年十二年间，美国售给英国的货物，在价值上比英国售给美国的货物多两倍以上。因此最近时期一向入超的英国愈来愈入不敷出了。
    一九一三年以后，英国就靠海外投资的利润来弥补其贸易收支的逆差。第二次世界大战期间，英国变卖了价值十一亿余英镑的海外资产，而且在战争期间负债累累，战后年年增加的贸易逆差，便不得不抽提黄金和美元的储备来支付，造成了严重的“美元荒”。英国的统治集团为了挽救黄金美元储备亏损的危机，一再采取削减美元货物进口的办法，同时计划扩大对美元区域的商品出口。但是今年头九个月贸易逆差仍达六亿五千六百七十万英镑，黄金美元存底还未达到“最低限度的安全水平”。所以英国打算再扩大帝国特惠关税制，以巩固它和美国竞争的地位，使美国货物更难在英镑区域内倾销；同时想借此要求美国降低高额的关税，让较多的英国货物能运销美国换取美元，防止美元短缺危机的进一步恶化。
    但是，英联邦内的其他一些国家却有着另外一种想法。如已投向美国怀抱的加拿大、澳大利亚等国，对于帝国特惠关税制已没有多大兴趣了。虽然它们从这个制度上也得过一些好处，获得了在英联邦范围内销售货物的有利条件，但是近年来加拿大、澳大利亚等国的进出口贸易大部分已转向美国，它们认为帝国特惠制只是强迫联邦各国“买英国货”的办法，对于它们扩大与美国之间的贸易是一种很大的障碍。它们要求降低关税壁垒，同时放宽对外国货物入口的限制，这实际上就是要给美国的货物打开英联邦的门户。由于联邦各国“同床异梦”，因而英国在联邦总理会议上提出的扩大帝国内部特惠关税制的建议遭到了否决，而加、澳等国对特惠关税制的反对也没有成功；会议决定了英国可以要求参加日内瓦关税贸易总协定的各国允许英国提高对某些进口货的关税。虽然美国和其他国家是否会答应英国的要求是另外一回事，但英联邦总理会议的这种决议，充分表明了英国决心要对美国向英镑地区的经济攻势展开激烈的斗争。因此，与此同时，英国已决定继续限制外国货物的入口。
    美元和英镑的斗争
    英联邦总理会议中讨论的另外一个问题——英镑的自由兑换，是和上面的问题相关联的。英联邦的
    一些国家极力要求恢复英镑的自由兑换，可是英国主张必须等到联邦支付情况好转和对外贸易扩大以后才能实现，由于英国的坚持，要求英镑自由兑换的呼声被压下去了。
    英国在三十年代形成的英镑区域，是它赖以和美国进行争霸的另外一个武器。英联邦各国（加拿大除外）和另外一些国家都被包括在它的这个金融势力范围之内，与以美国为首的美元集团抗衡。这个区域内的各国之间进行贸易要以英镑来结算，这样就使英国获得了对英镑区各国进行贸易的特权。英国一向是一个需要输入大量粮食和工业原料的国家，英镑区各国向英国销售粮食和原料而得到的英镑，要想兑换为美元或其他货币都要受到限制，它们必需拿来购买英国的工业品。于是英国在采购原料和推销产品两方面便都有了保证。有些国家向英国输出的货物多于从英国输入的货物时，也只能在伦敦储存一笔英镑的借差，这笔借差是不能兑换成可以向美元区域购买货物的美元的。英国这种限制汇兑的措施，对于美国的经济扩张，有极大的抗拒作用。因此美国处心积虑要想粉碎英镑体系，为它争夺英联邦和英镑区域市场扫除障碍。一九四五年底，美国曾以一笔贷款为饵，使英国答应解除汇兑统制。一九四七年七月英国履行贷款协定的条件，开始实行自由兑换，一下子就丧失掉了两亿五千万英镑的黄金和美元，造成英国猛烈的经济风暴。英国顾不了面子难堪，迅速宣布了停止英镑自由兑换，才堵住了国库的大漏洞。后来美国又利用“马歇尔计划”迫使英国同意通货的局部流通，各国在英国的借差的百分之二十五可以自由周转。但是，英国在美国压力下所作的这种让步，并未能使美国满意。美国继续想尽各种办法企图破坏英镑的国际通货地位，因此形成了美元和英镑的斗争。加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰等国这次在英联邦总理会议上积极要求恢复英镑的自由兑换，正是反映了美国的观点。
    加、澳、新等国的要求，是在扩展自由贸易的口号下提出的。这些国家的代表直接攻击限制英镑的兑换是强迫各国购买“昂贵”而“不合用”的英国货物。它们希望摆脱这种束缚，以便更加投靠美国。但是英国在这个问题上坚决不肯让步，因为它想起五年前的那一场风暴，还不免胆战心惊。现在英国的黄金美元储备还在危险的状况中，如实行自由兑换，势将招致经济的破产。英国未尝不怀念昔日英镑在世界通行无阻的威风，只是今天的境遇已大不相同，摆在英国面前的当急之务是挽救美元短缺的危机，还谈不到提高英镑的国际地位。不过英国为了缓和联邦各国之间的矛盾，还不得不同意放宽对美国投资的限制，准许外国投资人转移资本利润，让美国资本进一步侵入大英联邦。
    原料的争夺
    资本主义国家对原料的争夺由来已久，战后由于美国进行大规模的扩军备战，大量向国外掠夺和囤积战略原料，和英国的矛盾更加尖锐。美国自己不生产或产量不足的原料，很大部分是从英联邦各国购买的。去年美国橡胶、黄麻、羊毛、锡、铅、锰等主要原料的入口，有百分之三十二到九十三是来自大英帝国市场的。英国也是靠它的自治领和殖民地输出这些原料换回相当数量的美元收入。过去两年来，美国利用对苏联和人民民主国家实行“封锁禁运”政策和“停购”“囤积”等手段，垄断世界原料市场，压低原料的价格，使英国大受损失。如马来亚的天然橡胶的价格，自一九五○年十二月以来下跌了百分之六十以上，澳大利亚羊毛的价格跌了百分之六十至七十。美国操纵原料价格的政策，对于英国的经济是一个严重的打击。今年年初邱吉尔到华盛顿去曾经和美国就这个问题进行谈判，也没有多大结果。只是在锡的贸易上成立了协议。美国同意了在
    一年期间收购锡砂时要出固定的价格。其他商品的境况则并没有得到改善。另一方面，英国从美元区域输入的粮食和工业原料的价格，都受到美国的控制。因此在这次联邦总理会议上，英国提出开发联邦资源的口号，希望各自治领多生产原料，以供给英国的需要和向国外赚取美元；同时打算纠集联邦各国的力量，要求美国订立稳定商品价格的协定，来反对美国对原料的垄断。据传，邱吉尔已准备在明春到美国去进行谈判，并将提出提高黄金价格的要求。我们可以预料，到那时候美英两国的经济矛盾将更为表面化。
    这一次英联邦总理会议一方面暴露出，由于美国势力的侵入，英联邦已陷于分崩离析；另一方面也反映出，英国在美国经济攻击之下，一面退却还一面力图守住最后的阵地，并且待机反击。这两个资本主义大国之间正进行着殊死的斗争。斯大林说：
    “资本主义国家间争夺市场的斗争以及它们想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望，在实践上是比资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的矛盾更为剧烈。”这是一点不错的。
