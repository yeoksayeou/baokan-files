    The Valuable Enlightenment Soviet Photographers Give Us
    Stalin Prize Winner Xu Xiaobing
    As we welcome with utmost enthusiasm one of Stalin's envoys - the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation - to our motherland, I immediately recall two years ago, when Comrade Stalin sent many outstanding Soviet film workers to our country to guide and help us practically depict the epic history of our motherland and people vividly and correctly in the two films "Liberated China" and "The Victory of the Chinese People." I myself had the honor of participating in the work of the production team led by the Soviet film artist Comrade Gerasimov. During nearly a year of working with the Soviet film workers and during my two visits to the Soviet Union, I deeply felt the Soviet people's unparalleled and sincere love for the new China.

    I will always remember the selfless working spirit of every Soviet film worker who made the color documentary "Liberated China." They often neglected to eat a meal all day or even stayed awake for dozens of hours continuously because of the urgency of the work or to introduce their advanced theories and practice to us in combination. One day, American-made Chiang planes indiscriminately bombed Shanghai. At that time, none of us could stop the Soviet film workers from calmly filming, at the risk of their lives, scenes of bombs exploding, houses burning and collapsing, and innocent people lying in pools of blood….

    The heroic spirit and heroic deeds of the Soviet film workers constantly motivated me and my comrades.

    The arrival of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation in our country is a further development of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and even more a further development of the friendship between Chinese and Soviet film workers.

    We film photographers in the capital met Comrade Pavlov, a famous Soviet photographer, and felt particularly close and excited. In particular, we gained profound enlightenment and practical education from his discussions with us on some issues related to photography.

    Comrade Pavlov first stated: "Soviet film workers, in the great Patriotic War and in the beautiful socialist-communist construction, have not only played a very important role in propaganda and education, but also are active participants in building new human morality and a new life." Because he successfully implemented such a noble mission in his works, he was awarded the title of Honored Art Worker of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Stalin Prize.

    Then, Comrade Pavlov began to answer our questions about the production of musical drama films in the Soviet Union. He said: "In the Soviet Union, not every film director has the talent to direct this type of film. Because the director of this type of film must not only have a high level of musical accomplishment but also be good at accurately planning the actors' lines and delicate movements, the unity of rhythmic structure, and at the same time, must fully master highly comprehensive production skills. For example, in the 'Happy Life' film, the singing of Bibeling on the carriage, the music was completed in the recording studio in advance. During location shooting, the actor expressed the character's emotions sentence by sentence according to the lip movements, and then it was technically and correctly synthesized."

    He mentioned that Soviet film photographers, "are not ordinary technicians. An art film photographer does not just work according to the director's intention, but is also the organizer and creator of each frame - a painter. The photographer's responsibility is to express the plot of the theme artistically to the audience.

    "A news photographer must have a high degree of political sensitivity. He is not only a witness to the event, but also must infuse his own emotions through his own mind. In the documentary 'We Insist on Peace,' the close-up shots selected by the photographer from many women's ranks concentratedly expressed the emotions and will of German women demanding peace through their images, essentially expressing the event, so it can move the audience. This is the specialty of a news photographer, and this specialty is also extremely important for art film photographers.

    "In the shooting of the documentary 'We Insist on Peace,' we launched a serious struggle in creative methods and strictly stipulated: it is forbidden for news photographers to use the method of re-enactment during shooting. This practice not only destroys the style of the documentary, but more importantly, destroys political prestige.

    "A news photographer should go deep into life, understand life, and reflect the most important things in life. He should be a very agile sharpshooter. If he misses an enemy, he cannot shoot that enemy again, and he has not completed his task."

    He talked about the production of the huge film "We Insist on Peace": it was a joint production of the Soviet Moscow Film Studio and the Democratic German Defa Film Company. The author of this film, Comrade Pelyev, completed the script in Moscow. All the staff participating in this film carefully read the script in advance. Each staff member had a clear and unified thematic thought, and was inspired by this thematic thought.

    Pavlov said: "The filming of this film was basically carried out according to the intention of the script. However, in the aspect of shooting the beautiful life, in the aspect of exposing the crimes of war-mongers, it is very important to continuously obtain valuable supplements in reality. This film expresses the wishes of young people all over the world, the heroic anti-aggression struggle of young people all over the world, the victory of the Korean people and the Chinese people in the struggle against the American aggressors, and the victory of the Vietnamese people in the struggle against the French aggressors. These scenes make this film more substantial and full of brilliance.

    "The technical equipment, design and organization of this film's shooting are extremely complex. We can wash the negatives and make copies there at any time, so that the editing director can edit the film immediately. In this way, there is a reliable guarantee for improving the artistic and technical quality of the film."

    Comrade Pavlov has the most abundant experience in the performance of color films. He showed unique precision in color films such as "Siberian Symphony," "Happy Life," and "We Insist on Peace."

    Comrade Pavlov made a very broad, systematic, and thorough speech at this symposium. Our discussion lasted from noon until late at night. At the end of the discussion, Comrade Pavlov repeatedly declared to us: "During my visit to China, my time, actions, and everything belong to you." Although this is a seemingly simple language, the noble friendship it contains is incomparably profound. Chinese film workers will be proud of this friendship.

### 苏联摄影师给我们的宝贵启示

    苏联摄影师给我们的宝贵启示
    斯大林奖金获得者　徐肖冰
    当着我们以无比热烈的心情欢迎斯大林同志的使节之一——苏联电影艺术工作者代表团来到我们祖国的时候，我立刻回忆到二年前，斯大林同志曾派了许多苏联卓越的电影工作者来到我们祖国，切实地指导并帮助我们把自己的祖国和人民可歌可泣的历史，鲜明地、正确地雕塑在“解放了的中国”和“中国人民的胜利”二部影片中。我自己荣幸地参加了以苏联电影艺术家——格拉西莫夫同志为首的摄制组工作。我和苏联电影工作者在一块儿将近一年的工作中以及我二次访问苏联期间，使我深深地体会到苏联人民对于新中国的无比真诚的热爱。
    我永远记住摄制“解放了的中国”这部彩色纪录影片的每一个苏联电影工作者忘我的工作精神。他们经常因为工作的紧迫或者为了把他们的先进的理论和实际结合起来介绍给我们，就整天顾不上吃一顿饭，甚至连续几十小时不睡觉。有一天，美制蒋机滥炸上海，那时候我们谁也挡不住苏联电影工作者冒着生命的危险，从容地拍摄了炸弹在爆炸，房屋在燃烧、倒塌，被难的无辜的人民躺在血泊里的场面……。
    苏联电影工作者的英雄气概和英雄事迹，时时刻刻在鼓动着我和我的战友。
    苏联电影艺术工作者代表团，来到我们祖国，这是中苏两国人民友谊的进一步的发展，更是中苏两国电影工作者友谊的进一步的发展。
    我们在首都的电影摄影师会见了苏联著名的摄影师——巴甫洛夫同志，感到格外亲切而兴奋。尤其是他和我们一起座谈了有关摄影方面的一些问题，使我们得到了深刻的启示与切实的教育。
    巴甫洛夫同志首先谈到：“苏联电影工作者，在伟大的卫国战争中、在美好的社会主义——共产主义建设中，不仅起到了很重要的宣传教育作用，同时，他们也是建设人类新道德、新生活的积极参加者。”由于他把这样崇高的使命，成功地贯彻在自己的作品中，因此他荣膺了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国荣誉艺术工作者和斯大林奖金获得者的称号。
    接着，巴甫洛夫同志开始解答我们对于苏联摄制音乐戏剧片的问题。他说：“在苏联，不是任何一个电影导演，都有导演这种片子的才能。因为，这种片子的导演，不仅要有高度的音乐修养，还要善于精确地计划演员的说白和细致的动作、节奏结构上的统一性，同时必须完全掌握高度的全面的制作技巧。如‘幸福的生活’影片中的毕百灵坐在马车上的一段歌唱，音乐是在录音棚内先期完成，在外景拍摄中，演员逐句地对着口形表现角色的情绪，然后从技术上非常正确地把它合成起来。”
    他谈到苏联电影摄影师，“那不是一般的技术人员。一个艺术片摄影师，不只是按照导演的意图工作，而且是每个画面的组织者和创造者——是一个画家。摄影师的责任就是把主题的情节，艺术地表达给观众。
    “新闻摄影师，必须具备高度的政治敏感。他不仅是事件的见证人，而且要通过自己的头脑，把自己的情感贯串进去。‘我们坚持和平’这部纪录影片中，摄影师在许多妇女行列中挑选的几个特写镜头，那就是通过她们的形象集中表现了德国妇女要求和平的情绪与意志，本质地表现了事件，因此它能够感动观众。这是新闻摄影师的特长，这种特长对艺术片摄影师也是极其重要的。
    “在‘我们坚持和平’这部纪录影片的拍摄中，我们在创作方法上曾展开了严肃的斗争，并严格地规定：禁止新闻摄影师在拍摄时用重新表演的手法，这种做法不但破坏了纪录片的风格，更重要的是破坏政治威信。
    “一个新闻摄影师应该深入生活、了解生活，把生活中最重要的反映出来。他应该是一个十分敏捷的特等射击手，如果错过一个敌人，那就不能重复射击那个敌人，也就没有完成自己的任务。”
    他谈到“我们坚持和平”这部巨大的影片的制作：那是苏联莫斯科电影制片厂和民主德国的德发影片公司联合摄制的。这部片子的作者——培利耶夫同志在莫斯科就完成了剧本。参加这部片子的所有工作人员，在事先都认真地熟读了这个剧本。每个工作人员都有了明确的、统一的主题思想，而被这个主题思想所鼓舞。
    巴甫洛夫说：“这部影片的摄制，基本上是按照剧本的意图进行的。然而在拍摄美好生活的方面，在揭露战争贩子罪恶行为方面，在现实中不断地得到宝贵的补充，这是非常重要的。在这部片子里，表现了全世界青年的愿望，表现了全世界青年英勇的反侵略斗争，表现了朝鲜人民和中国人民在反抗美国侵略者斗争中的胜利，也表现了越南人民在反抗法国侵略者斗争中的胜利，这些场面使这部片子更加充实和充满了光彩。
    “拍摄这部片子的技术装备和设计及其组织工作，都是极庞杂的。我们可以在那里随时冲洗底片和拷贝出来，使剪接导演立刻把片子编辑起来。这样，对提高影片艺术上、技术上的质量，都有了可靠的保证。”
    巴甫洛夫同志对于在五彩片的性能上所积累的经验，是最丰富的。他在“西伯利亚交响曲”“幸福的生活”“我们坚持和平”等彩色影片中，都表现了独特的精确性。
    巴甫洛夫同志在这次座谈会上，作了极广泛、系统而周密的发言。我们的座谈，从中午直到深夜，在座谈结束的时候，巴甫洛夫同志重复地向我们声明：“我在访问中国的期间，我的时间、行动和一切，都是属于你们的。”虽然这是一句似乎简单的语言，可是它所含蓄着兄弟般的高贵的友谊，是无比深厚的。中国人民电影工作者将为这种友谊而感到自豪。
