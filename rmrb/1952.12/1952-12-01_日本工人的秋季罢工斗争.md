    The broad masses of Japanese workers, led by those in the electrical industry and coal mines, are engaged in an autumn strike struggle, refusing to endure the impoverished lives caused by the remilitarization policy and demanding higher wages.
    The 120,000 electrical industry workers belonging to the All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union first launched a strike on September 24th to demand higher wages. Because the employers stubbornly refused the workers' demands, they held eleven consecutive power outage strikes on October 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, 21st and 22nd, 28th, November 7th, 12th and 13th, 17th and 18th, 21st and 22nd. The workers of sixteen large coal mines belonging to the Japan Coal Miners' Union held a 48-hour strike on October 13th and 14th, and then began an indefinite strike from the 17th, which has lasted for more than forty days. Coal miners in medium and small mines in Kyushu, Yamaguchi, Hokkaido and other places have also participated in the strike, and the number of striking coal miners has increased to as many as 270,000. Workers belonging to unions such as the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Teachers' Union, the Metal Workers' Union, and the Automobile Industry Workers' Union have also participated in or are preparing to participate in the struggle to demand wage increases. At the same time, workers of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union held sit-down strikes demanding wage increases and year-end bonuses. Members of the Japan Council of Government and Public Corporation Workers' Unions launched a struggle on October 13th demanding the payment of year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' salary and wage increases. They also held a conference and demonstration parade on November 15th. The All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, representing approximately 150,000 postal and telecommunications workers, also held a national representative meeting on November 7th, resolving to oppose the US-prompted rearmament of Japan, to oppose the revision of the constitution prohibiting rearmament, and to formulate a plan for a wage increase movement and a plan to restore the right to strike for civil servants, which had been illegally deprived.
    This long-term strike struggle by Japanese workers to demand higher wages is inseparable from the struggle against US imperialism's transformation of Japan into a US military base and the revival of Japanese militarism. As the United States intensifies its war policy towards Japan and its ruthless plunder, Japan's economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious. Recently, the recession in Japanese industry has spread from textiles, steel, shipping, and chemicals to coal, hardware, and petroleum industries. From January to August this year, more than 9,000 Japanese companies have declared bankruptcy, and the lives of Japanese workers are now in an unbearable state of poverty. However, the US-Japan monopoly capitalists, in pursuit of greater profits, are forcibly implementing American-style "enterprise rationalization" in Japanese industry. The characteristic of this highly exploitative policy is to intensify the inhuman plunder of Japanese workers. Taking the coal mining industry as an example, the capitalists have formulated a three-year plan to "rationalize" Japanese coal mines in accordance with the wishes of their American masters. This plan stipulates that the daily output of Japanese coal miners should be increased from twelve tons to seventeen tons, while wages should be reduced by half, and 70,000 to 100,000 workers should be laid off. The American bracing method has already been adopted in Japanese coal mines. This method saves some wood, but the casualty rate of workers has doubled as a result.
    Under these circumstances, Japanese workers have no choice but to rise up and fight for their right to live. They have persisted in long-term strikes to oppose the plunder and exploitation of US-Japan monopoly capitalists. In the past two months, Japanese electrical industry workers have held eleven consecutive power outage strikes. Each time, the national electricity supply has been reduced by 20% to 25%, forcing large factories owned by US-Japan monopoly capitalists to suspend work and reduce production. The Japanese coal miners' strike, which has lasted for more than a month, has resulted in a loss of more than 2.8 million tons of coal, and even forced the nationwide reduction of train services. Electricity and coal mines are the main sectors of industry. The autumn strike of the broad masses of Japanese workers, led by those in the electricity and coal mining industries, has persisted for two months, severely打击(dǎjī) the war preparations of the US-Japan reactionaries.
    The US occupation forces in Japan are attempting to use force to threaten the Japanese workers who are on strike, and have threatened to declare "martial law." The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is plotting to use reactionary laws to force suppression, and is using extremely despicable means to buy off right-wing socialists and instruct spies of the "Love Labor Faction" to carry out sabotage from within the trade unions. With the support of the US-Japan reactionaries, the capitalists in the electrical industry and coal mining industries are also stubbornly and unreasonably refusing the workers' demands. Although Japanese workers are fighting in difficult circumstances, they have not only not succumbed, but have become stronger in the struggle. This is already manifested in the long-term persistence of the strike.
    The just struggle of Japanese workers for improved living conditions has received widespread support and sympathy from the working classes of all countries. Schroder, General Secretary of the Coal Miners' International of the World Federation of Trade Unions, recently wrote to Japanese coal miners, on behalf of the four million members participating in the Coal Miners' International, to pay tribute to Japanese coal miners and wish them victory in their struggle for wage increases. The Chinese people are very concerned about the situation of Japanese striking workers and warmly support their struggle. On November 4th, Jin Zhinan, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union, and Cai Shubin, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Electricity Industry Union, respectively sent telegrams to the Japan Coal Miners' Union and the All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union, expressing the deep concern of Chinese coal miners and electrical workers and the Chinese working class for Japanese workers, and resolutely supporting their strike struggle. The telegrams also wished them victory in their united struggle to increase base wages and defend the basic rights of trade unions and workers, and new victories in their heroic struggle against the evil rule of US imperialism and the Yoshida government and for the establishment of an independent, democratic, free, and peaceful new Japan.

    日本工人的秋季罢工斗争
    日本广大工人以电气产业和煤矿工人为首，正在进行着拒绝忍受重新军国主义化政策所造成的贫困生活、要求提高工资的秋季罢工斗争。
    全日本电气产业工会所属的十二万电气产业工人，在九月二十四日首先展开要求提高工资的罢工后，由于资方一味拒绝工人的要求，又在十月三日、七日、十一日、十五日、二十一日及二十二日、二十八日、十一月七日、十二日及十三日、十七日及十八日、二十一日及二十二日连续举行了十一次停电罢工。日本煤矿工会所属的十六个大煤矿的工人，于十月十三日至十四日举行了四十八小时的罢工后，并自十七日起开始了无一定期限的罢工，迄今已坚持四十多天了。九州、山口、北海道等地的中、小煤矿工人也曾参加罢工，罢工的煤矿工人曾增至二十七万人之多。日本私营铁道工会、日本教职员工会、金属工人工会、汽车产业工人工会等工会所属工人，也都参加了或正准备参加要求增加工资的斗争。与此同时，日本国营铁道工会工人举行了静坐罢工要求增加工资和发给年终津贴。日本官公厅工会协议会所属会员在十月十三日发起了要求发给相当于两个月薪金的年终津贴和提高工资的斗争。并在十一月十五日召开了大会，举行了示威游行。代表着约十五万名邮电职工的日本全国递信从业员工会也在十一月七日举行了全国代表会议，决议反对美国促使日本重新武装、反对修改禁止重新武装的宪法并拟订了要求增加工资运动计划及要求恢复被非法剥夺了的公务员罢工权的计划。
    日本工人为要求提高工资而进行的这次长期罢工斗争，是和反对美帝国主义变日本为美国的军事基地、复活日本军国主义的斗争分不开的。由于美国加强对日本实施战争政策和残酷掠夺，日本的经济危机越来越严重了。最近日本工业的不景气已从纺织、钢铁、航运、化学工业波及到煤炭、五金和石油等各个产业部门。今年一月到八月间，日本宣告破产的公司就已超过九千家，目前日本工人的生活已陷于难以忍受的贫困境地。而美、日独占资本家却为了追求更大的利润，正在日本工业中强迫实行美国式的“企业合理化”，这种高度榨取政策的特点，就是加强对日本工人进行非人的掠夺。以煤矿业为例，资方遵从美国主子意旨使日本煤矿“合理化”的三年计划已经拟成，这计划规定使日本煤矿工人每日的生产量从十二吨提高到十七吨，而工资则减少一半，并减少七万到十万名工人。现在日本煤矿中已经采用了美国的支架方法，这方法节省了一些木料，但工人的伤亡率却因而增加了一倍。
    在这种情况下，日本工人不能不起来为争取生活权利而进行斗争。他们坚持了长期的罢工，反对美、日独占资本家的掠夺和剥削。近两个月来日本电气产业工人连续十一次的停电罢工，每次都使日本全国电力供应量减少百分之二十到百分之二十五，迫使美、日独占资本家的大工厂不得不停工减产。日本煤矿工人一个多月来的罢工，已使煤产量损失了两百八十万吨以上，甚至使日本全国的火车都将减少班次。电气和煤矿是工业中的主要部门，以电气和煤矿工人为首的日本广大工人坚持已达两月的秋季罢工，严重地打击了美、日反动派的备战措施。
    美国驻日本占领军企图用武力威胁正在进行罢工的日本工人，已扬言将要宣布“戒严”；日本吉田反动政府阴谋借反动法律强迫进行镇压，并以极其卑劣的手段收买右派社会党人及指使奸细“爱劳派”从工会内部进行破坏；电气产业和煤矿业的资方也在美、日反动派的支持下一味无理拒绝工人要求。日本工人虽然是在艰苦的情况中进行斗争，然而他们不但没有屈服，而且在斗争中更加坚强了。这在罢工的长期坚持方面就已表现出来。
    日本工人为改善生活而进行的正义斗争，得到各国工人阶级的广泛支持和同情。世界工会联合会煤矿国际总书记施洛德最近写信给日本煤矿工人，代表参加煤矿国际的四百万会员向日本煤矿工人致敬，并祝他们在增加工资的斗争中获得胜利。中国人民非常关怀日本罢工工人所处的境遇并热烈支援他们的斗争。十一月四日中国煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫和中国电业工会全国委员会主席蔡书彬分别致电日本煤矿工会和全日本电气产业工会，表示中国煤矿工人电气工人及中国工人阶级对日本工人的深切关怀，和坚决支持他们的罢工斗争。电文中并祝他们在提高基准工资、保卫工会与工人的基本权利的团结斗争中取得胜利，在反对美帝国主义和吉田政府的罪恶统治以及为了建立一个独立、民主、自由、和平的新日本的英勇斗争中获得新的胜利。
