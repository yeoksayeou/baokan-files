The South Dongting Lake renovation project, which concerns the interests of all the people of Hunan Province, has been approved and implemented by the Central People's Government and the Central-South Military and Political Committee. The Hunan Provincial People's Government has decided to fully commence construction on December 15 and complete it on schedule by March 15 of next year.

Water conservancy is currently one of the crucial factors for increasing agricultural production in Hunan Province. The Dongting Lake area is also Hunan Province's "granary." The area's paddy fields account for one-tenth of the province's total paddy field area. The land is fertile, with an average annual grain yield of over 600 jin per mu. The total rice production accounts for one-sixth of the province's total rice production. The area's cotton production accounts for half of the province's total cotton production.

In the three years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, farmers in the Dongting Lake area have worked hard to repair dikes, completing over 120 million cubic meters of earthwork, resulting in three consecutive years of agricultural bumper harvests. However, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' decades of reactionary rule before liberation, serious disasters were left in the water conservancy projects of Dongting Lake. As a result, fundamental governance could not be carried out in the short period of three years after liberation, and the hidden dangers of water disasters in the Dongting Lake area still exist.

Dongting Lake was originally a natural lake regulating the Yangtze River and the four rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li. In the past hundred years, the Yangtze River's floods have diverted into the lake through the four outlets of Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian, carrying large amounts of sediment and depositing them everywhere, forming islands. The reactionary rulers of the past not only failed to manage it well but also colluded with feudal landlords to compete for reclamation, resulting in a shrinking lake area, reduced water storage capacity, and mutual interference of the flood channels of the four rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li. The poldered fields were increasingly lower than the lake surface, making it difficult to drain waterlogged areas. As a result, floods occurred frequently, and water disasters were rampant. According to a survey by the Hunan Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau in 1951, more than 143 million cubic meters of sediment flowed into Dongting Lake from the Yangtze River annually, more than 13 million cubic meters of sediment flowed into the lake from the four rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li, and only more than 24 million cubic meters of sediment flowed out of Chenglingji, with more than 132 million cubic meters of sediment deposited in the lake every year. During the eleven years from 1937 to 1947, the total lake area of Dongting Lake during floods decreased from 4,700 square kilometers to 3,100 square kilometers, shrinking by one-third. At the same time, the area of poldered fields increased from 3,000 square kilometers (one square kilometer equals 1,500 mu) to 4,800 square kilometers. From 1934 to 1947, most of the lake bottom was silted up by five to six meters. As a result, major floods occurred in 1931, 1935, 1948, and 1949, each time inundating 70 percent of all the fields in the Dongting Lake area. In the major flood of 1931, the flood volume flowing into the lake from the Yangtze River, Xiang River, Zi River, Yuan River, and Li River simultaneously, excluding the flood flowing into the Yangtze River from the Dongting Lake mouth, left 50 billion cubic meters of floodwater in Dongting Lake. At that time, the lake's flood storage capacity was only 6.6 billion cubic meters, and 4 million mu of fertile land in the Dongting Lake area was flooded. Now, Dongting Lake's flood storage capacity has been greatly reduced, and it can only store 3.8 billion cubic meters of floodwater during the mid-water level period. If it encounters the major flood of 1931 again, all the poldered fields in the Dongting Lake area will be completely submerged.

Now, the Hunan Provincial People's Government has decided to start renovating South Dongting Lake in December. In the future, it will gradually carry out fundamental governance of the entire Dongting Lake water conservancy project. The fundamental governance of the Dongting Lake project includes "merging polders" and "diverting flows," adjusting the flood channels of the four rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li to prevent them from interfering with each other, and expanding Dongting Lake's flood storage capacity. However, the deep-seated hidden dangers of water disasters in Dongting Lake can only be completely eliminated after the Yangtze River is fundamentally governed. The fundamental governance project plan for South Dongting Lake has been approved and implemented by the Central People's Government and the Central-South Military and Political Committee. The main content of this plan is to improve the flood channels of the Xiang River and Zi River into the lake, separate the main streams of the two rivers, and combine the restoration of breached polders with planned polder mergers and flow blocking, while also considering navigation and waterlogging drainage. The entire project is divided into three parts: First, the river body of the Xiang River's flood channel from the Haohekou to Biandanxia section will be widened to the southwest; second, all the tributaries of the Zi River's flood channel into the lake will be blocked, except for the Ganxigang River, which will be retained for convenient shipping, so that the main stream of the Zi River flows into Dongting Lake through the Cihukou; in addition, the original main stream through Baimasi and Linzikou will be retained to facilitate navigation; third, breached polders will be restored, and Baomin Polder, Minzhu Polder, and Lecheng Polder will be merged and restored, while Minxin Polder and Dingxin Polder will be merged and restored. The entire project involves a total of 19 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 250,000 cubic meters of stonework. After the completion of the entire project, not only will the more than 240,000 mu of farmland flooded this year be able to resume production and the more than 100,000 disaster victims be able to rebuild their homes, but it will also shorten the levee line by 257 kilometers, a 55 percent reduction compared to the original levee line, and increase cultivated land by 50,000 mu.

In order to complete this major project plan, the Hunan Provincial People's Government is leading the people of the province to step up preparations. The province is preparing to mobilize 240,000 laborers to invest in this work. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hunan Provincial People's Government, and the Hunan Military Region have jointly issued a general mobilization order for the renovation of South Dongting Lake. The South Dongting Lake Renovation Project Committee and the South Dongting Lake Renovation Project Headquarters were established on November 13, and two sub-headquarters were established in Xiangtan and Changde. Cheng Qian serves as the chairman of the South Dongting Lake Renovation Project Committee, and Jin Ming, Wen Niansheng, Tang Shengzhi, and Tan Yubao serve as vice chairmen. Wen Niansheng serves as the commander of the South Dongting Lake Renovation Project Headquarters, and Li Yizhi, Sun Yunying, and Qi Shouliang serve as deputy commanders. Jin Ming serves as the political commissar, and Zhou Hui and Hu Jizong serve as deputy political commissars.

### 湖南省人民政府决定大力整修南洞庭湖

    湖南省人民政府决定大力整修南洞庭湖
    关系着湖南省全省人民利益的南洞庭湖整修工程，经中央人民政府和中南军政委员会批准实施后，湖南省人民政府已决定在十二月十五日全面动工，并限于明年三月十五日按期完成。
    水利问题，在目前是湖南省争取农业增产的决定关键之一。洞庭湖滨地区又是湖南省的“粮仓”。该地区的稻田面积，占全省稻田总面积十分之一，土地肥沃，每亩田每年平均产谷六百斤以上，稻谷总产量占全省稻谷总产量的六分之一；该地区棉花产量又占全省棉花总产量的一半。
    解放三年以来，洞庭湖滨的农民，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，努力修复堤垸，一共作了一亿二千多万土方，使洞庭湖滨地区，一连得到了三年的农产丰收。但是由于国民党反动派在解放前的几十年的反动统治，在洞庭湖水利工程上，留下了深重的灾难，致使在解放后三年的短时期中，还不能进行根本治理，洞庭湖滨地区的水祸隐患，仍然
    存在。
    洞庭湖原为调节长江及湘、资、沅、澧四水的天然湖泊，近百余年来，长江洪水自松滋、太平、藕
    池、调弦四口，挟带大量泥沙分泄入湖，到处淤积成
    洲。历代的反动统治者，不但不加以很好的治理，反而勾结着封建地主，竞相围垦，以致湖面日狭，蓄水量减少，湘、资、沅、澧四水的入湖洪道互相抵触，垸田日益低于湖面，渍水很难排出。于是洪水泛滥，水灾频仍。根据一九五一年湖南省人民政府水利局的测量，每年由长江流入洞庭湖的泥沙，达一亿四千三百多万立方公尺，由湘、资、沅、澧四水流入湖中的泥沙一千三百多万立方公尺，由城陵矶流出的泥沙只有二千四百多万立方公尺，每年淤积在湖里的泥沙有一亿三千二百多万立方公尺。在一九三七年至一九四七年十一年中间，洞庭湖在洪水时期的湖泊总面积，由四千七百平方公里减至三千一百平方公里，缩小了三分之一；同时垸田面积由三千平方公里（一平方公里合一千五百亩）增至四千八百平方公里。自一九三四年至一九四七年中，大部分湖底淤高了五公尺到六公尺。因而在
    一九三一、一九三五、一九四八、一九四九年发生过四次大水灾，每次淹没的田地，都占洞庭湖滨全部田地的百分之七十。一九三一年的一次大水灾，由长江、湘江、资江、沅江、澧水同时流入湖中的洪水量，除由洞庭湖口流入长江的洪水外，还有五百亿立方公尺的洪水停留在洞庭湖内。那时，湖身的蓄洪量只有六十六亿立方公尺，因而洞庭湖滨有四百万亩良田被淹没。现在洞庭湖的蓄洪量又大大减少了，在中水位时期，只能蓄存洪水三十八亿立方公尺，如果再遇到一九三一年的大洪水，则洞庭湖滨所有的垸田将全部淹没。
    现在，湖南省人民政府已决定在十二月间动工整修南洞庭湖。今后并将逐步的对整个洞庭湖水利工
    程进行根本治理。根本治理洞庭湖工程，一是“并
    垸”，一是“分流”，调整湘、资、沅、澧四水入湖洪道，使其不再互相抵触，扩大洞庭湖的蓄洪量。但洞庭湖的深重水祸隐患，只有在根本治理长江以后，才能彻底消除。关于南洞庭湖的根本治理工程计划，已经中央人民政府和中南军政委员会批准实施。这个计划的主要内容，是改善湘江、资江的入湖洪道，使两江的主流分离，并有计划地结合修复溃垸，进行并垸堵流，同时兼顾航运与排渍。全部工程分三部分：一、把湘江入湖洪道由濠河口至扁担浃一段的江身，向西南展宽；二、资江入湖洪道各支流，除保留甘溪港一条便利行船外，其余全部堵塞使资江主流经茈湖口入洞庭湖；另外，还保留经白马寺、临资口的原来主流，以利航运；三、修复溃垸，把保民垸、民主垸、乐成垸合并修复，民新垸和鼎新垸合并修复。全部工程共有土方
    一千九百万公方，石方二十五万多公方。全部工程完成后，不但可使今年被淹的二十四万多亩田地能恢复生产，十多万灾民能重建家园，而且还能缩短堤线二百五十七公里，比原来的堤线缩短百分之五十五，并能增加耕地五万亩。
    为了完成这一个重大的工程计划，湖南省人民政府正领导全省人民，加紧进行准备工作。全省准备动员二十四万民工投入这一工作。中共湖南省委员会、湖南省人民政府、湖南军区已联合发出整修南洞庭湖的总动员令。南洞庭湖整修工程委员会和南洞庭湖整修工程指挥部，已于十一月十三日成立，并在湘潭、常德成立两个分指挥部。由程潜任南洞庭湖整修工程委员会的主任委员，金明、文年生、唐生智、谭余保为副主任委员；文年生任南洞庭湖整修工程指挥部指挥，李毅之、孙云英、齐寿良任副指挥，金明任政治委员，周惠、胡继宗任副政治委员。
