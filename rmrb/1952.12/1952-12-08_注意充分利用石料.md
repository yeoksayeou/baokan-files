    Pay Attention to Fully Utilizing Stone Materials

    Comrade Editor: Stone materials are an important material in basic construction, but in Beijing, the production of stone materials cannot meet the demand. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that there are few stone material production areas near Beijing, and on the other hand, many construction units adopt the material standards of the Anglo-American bourgeoisie. Some people believe that concrete projects must use 5/8-inch stones. However, in the production of 5/8-inch stones, larger stones and smaller stones larger and smaller than 5/8 inch are inevitably produced. In the past, many units did not use these large and small stones, making these stone materials surplus and idle. According to a recent statistic from a certain place in Beijing, there are tens of thousands of cubic meters of such unused stone materials, equivalent to more than one billion yuan.

    But can these stone materials be used in concrete projects? According to the current experience in the Northeast, these stone materials are not unusable. In concrete projects, the Northeast does not use 5/8-inch stones of the same particle size, but uses continuously graded stones of mixed sizes. The results of their use have proven that not only does it not reduce the quality of the project, but it can also achieve a good effect of minimum voids and maximum density. If the construction units adopt this advanced experience, they can not only fully utilize stone materials and save national resources, but also solve the problem of stone materials not meeting demand. Therefore, I hope that all construction units adopt this advanced experience.

### 注意充分利用石料

    注意充分利用石料
    编辑同志：在基本建设中，石料是重要材料之一，但在北京，石料的生产是供不应求的。其原因，一方面是北京附近的石料产地少，另一方面是各建筑单位多采用英美资产阶级的用料标准，有些人认为：混凝土工程，非用五八分石子不可。但在生产五八分石子时，必然又要附带生产出大于五八分的大石子和小于五八分的小石子。过去很多单位都不用这些大石料和小石料，使得这些石料成为呆料。根据北京某处最近的统计，像这样的不用的石料就有十几万方，折合十亿多元。
    但是这些石料在混凝土工程中，究竟能不能用呢？根据目前东北经验证明：这些石料并不是不能用。东北在混凝土工程中，不用颗粒一样大小的五八分石子，而采用大小相混的连续汲配石子。他们使用的结果证明：不但未降低工程质量，而且还可以收到空隙最小密度最大的良好效果。如果各建筑单位采用这一先进经验，不仅可以充分利用石料，节省国家资财，而且可以解决石料供不应求的问题。因此，我希望各建筑单位采用这个先进经验。
