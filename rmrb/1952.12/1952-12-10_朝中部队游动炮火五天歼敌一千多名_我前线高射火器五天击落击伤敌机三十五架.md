Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: On December 1st, the Korean front experienced its second heavy snowfall, bringing extremely cold weather. Consequently, ground combat activities on the front lines were relatively subdued compared to previous days during the five-day period from the 1st to the 5th.

Only small-scale battles occurred on the ridge to the left of Shangganling. The enemy, clinging to the edge of our positions on this ridge, desperately attempted to improve their extremely unfavorable situation, launching several weak harassment actions. However, the enemy failed to achieve this objective; on the contrary, they suffered over 380 casualties. The enemy's largest harassment action began around 2:00 PM on the 3rd, when two companies of enemy troops advanced towards the main peak of this ridge in three directions. They then launched eleven consecutive attacks with squads or platoons. After less than two hours of intense fighting, the enemy retreated with over 200 casualties.

On the Western Front, our forces repelled eight harassing attacks by the enemy in areas east and southeast of Kaesong during these five days, inflicting over 120 casualties. In other areas of the front, there were only minor skirmishes between the enemy and our forces.

During these five days, our mobile artillery fire on the front lines killed or wounded over 1,100 enemy soldiers. Our frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down 12 enemy planes and damaged 23, including the 18 enemy planes shot down or damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery units in the Shangganling area on the 5th alone.

    朝中部队游动炮火五天歼敌一千多名
    我前线高射火器五天击落击伤敌机三十五架
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】本月一日，朝鲜前线下了第二场大雪，天气十分严寒。在一日至五日的五天中，前线的地面战事也因此比前沉寂。
    上甘岭左边的山岭上只有小规模的战斗。爬在这个山岭我军阵地边沿上的敌人，企图改善所处的极端不利的地位，挣扎着进行数次微弱的袭扰行动。但是敌人没有达到这个目的，相反的却伤亡了三百八十多人。敌人最大的一次袭扰行动是在三日下午二时许开始，两个连的敌人分成三路向这个山岭主峰逼近。然后用一个班或一个排的兵力连续进行了十一次攻击，经不到两小时的激战，敌人伤亡了二百多名后撤退下去。
    西线我军在开城以东和东南等地区，在这五天中击退了敌人八次袭扰性的攻击，计毙伤敌军一百二十多名。前线其他地区，敌我双方仅有小接触。
    在这五天中，前线我军游动炮火共毙伤敌军一千一百多名；前线我军高射火器共击落敌机十二架，击伤敌机二十三架。其中包括上甘岭地区我军高射炮部队在五日一天中击落击伤的敌机十八架在内。
