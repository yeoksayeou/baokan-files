Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Recently, trade union organizations across the Soviet Union have held meetings to discuss how to respond to the call of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the specific steps to implement the Five-Year Plan.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions recently held its ninth plenary session, discussing the report by V.V. Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, on "The Work of Trade Union Organizations After the Publication of the Resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." It passed a resolution calling on trade union organizations at all levels to fully unleash the labor enthusiasm and creative initiative of the broad masses to accomplish the tasks put forward by the Party Congress and achieve new victories in communist construction. The resolution pointed out that trade union organizations must more broadly launch socialist competitions, strive for every enterprise to fulfill and overfulfill its plans, further improve product quality and reduce production costs, save on raw materials, fuel, and electricity, implement a conservation system, and utilize production potential. Trade union organizations and economic leaders should support model workers, support the initiatives of advanced workers and innovators, and tirelessly promote the application of advanced experiences. Trade union organizations and economic organizations should pay special attention to improving labor productivity, must make every effort to strengthen labor discipline and state discipline, improve the use of machinery and equipment, pay attention to cultivating and improving the cultural and technical level of employees, launch mass invention and rationalization proposal movements, strive for comprehensive mechanization of production processes, improve working conditions in various enterprise departments, and pay attention to meeting the cultural and material needs of employees. The resolution emphasized that trade union organizations have the responsibility to fully develop self-criticism, especially criticism from below, carefully listen to the opinions of employees, and resolutely eliminate the shortcomings that have been exposed.

The central committees of various industrial trade unions and the plenary sessions and trade union staff meetings held by local trade unions have all studied in detail how to respond to the call of the CPSU Congress and implement the specific steps of the Five-Year Plan. At the Moscow Municipal Trade Union Cadre Meeting, the reporter gave a detailed report on the socialist guarantees of Moscow factories to practice completing the plan ahead of schedule. The "Three Mountains" Textile Factory increased production by 1.5 million meters of fabric above the plan in the first ten months of this year. In the first nine months of this year, workers and technicians in Moscow's machinery and machine-building industry, machine tool manufacturing industry, chemical industry, automobile and tractor manufacturing industry, and electrical industry put forward approximately 40,000 rationalization proposals. Many of these suggestions have been implemented, resulting in a total savings of more than 82 million rubles per year. At the Leningrad Trade Union Staff Meeting, speakers detailed how factory employees worked with staff from the city's institutions of higher education and scientific research institutes to strive for technological progress. They have now designed and produced hundreds of new machines, instruments, and equipment. The speaker emphasized the government's constant concern for improving working conditions, with allocations of more than 90 million rubles in this area this year. All the resolutions passed at these meetings emphasized that Soviet trade union organizations must take the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the CPSU as a guide in all their work.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The scale of the socialist competition of workers in various industries in the Soviet Union to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is expanding.

In the coal mining industry, the competition initiated by the miners of the Trudovskaya Coal Mine in the Donbas mining area to reach the predetermined production capacity ahead of schedule has been responded to by coal areas across the country. The Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry believes that this movement is an important method for successfully completing the task of increasing coal production in the new Five-Year Plan. Now, thousands of miners in the Donbas, Moscow, Karaganda, and other coal areas have participated in this socialist competition movement.

In metal cutting, Nina Yushina, Anastasia Malyukina, and Oleg Sharantsev, advanced young lathe operators at the Moscow "Red Proletarian" factory, recently put forward a new initiative to launch a competition to shorten the production cycle. They advocated better use of the factory's fixed and working capital, reducing the amount of labor required for finished products, and shortening the total cycle of lathe part processing by reducing auxiliary operation time and using the most reasonable working methods when implementing high-speed cutting methods. This initiative has been supported by the factory's party organization. Now, the staff of all other workshops in the factory have participated in this movement.

In the textile industry, Nina Amelichenkova, a Stakhanovite female worker at the Lenin Fine Wool Textile Factory in Moscow Oblast, recently launched a socialist competition movement to improve product quality in response to the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the CPSU. All employees of the factory have formulated a specific plan to ensure that the production index of first-class products in 1953 will be increased from 99.85 percent stipulated this year to 99.9 percent by using various advanced methods; eliminate third-class products, and reduce the losses caused by the reduction of goods quality to one ten-thousandth of the total cost of products. Recently, the special committee of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry discussed this proposal and suggested that factories across the country widely introduce this proposal and organize large-scale competition movements.

In the construction industry, Moscow construction workers recently launched a competition movement to complete the task of increasing labor productivity stipulated in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This initiative has been warmly responded to by construction workers across the country. Stonemasons, wall painters, bricklayers, and carpentry teams in various places have put forward new guarantees, and many new production achievements have been created. For example, in Moscow, the six carpentry teams that installed the Charyadye local building frame regularly complete 200 to 250 percent of their quotas. The advanced worker Pankratov's team recently responded to the call of the Moscow workers and guaranteed to complete the task of increasing labor productivity by 55 percent stipulated in the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, that is, in 1954, complete the annual residential construction plan 25 days ahead of schedule this year, and increase labor productivity by 10 percent before the end of this year.
