(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th) Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba, head of the Tibetan Delegation, and Gesang Wangdui, head of the Qamdo Tibetan People's National Day Observation Delegation, spoke to reporters from this agency after concluding their visits to Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. They highly praised the economic recovery and development in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia after liberation, as well as the happy life enjoyed by people of all ethnic groups under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.

Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba said: "From November 11th to now, we have visited Hailar City, Xin Barag Left Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the cities of Harbin, Lushun, and Shenyang in Northeast China. We have personally witnessed that under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of Northeast China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively working and have built numerous large-scale modern factories from the ruins created by Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in just a few years. During this period, private industrial and commercial enterprises have also greatly developed. For example, the Tongji Department Store in Harbin had only twenty-four employees during the rule of Japanese imperialism, and its business was on the verge of collapse. However, now, under the protection and assistance of the People's Government, its capital has reached more than 15 billion yuan, and the number of employees has nearly tripled."

The representatives all expressed their deep emotion at the warm welcome from the people of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. Gesang Wangdui said: "During the more than twenty days, whenever we arrived at any station in Inner Mongolia and Northeast China, we were warmly welcomed by the heads of local People's Governments and people of all ethnic groups, who kindly introduced the situation to us. When we visited nurseries in Harbin and Inner Mongolia, children over the age of two sang and danced for us to express ethnic friendship. Many young men and women from the Lushun Cultural Troupe studied ethnic songs and dances with us all day long, and when we left them, they were reluctant to part. This brotherly love made us feel the warmth of the motherland's big family."

The representatives were particularly excited about the achievements of Inner Mongolia today. Because they believe that the economic, cultural, and other aspects of Tibet and Inner Mongolia were originally similar. But Inner Mongolia today is very different. Gesang Wangdui said: "Today, with the help of Chairman Mao, the people of Inner Mongolia have established milk factories, power plants, and leather factories; new schools that can accommodate more than 500 students have been built in the desert pastoral areas. Hailar, a city with a population of 30,000, has 5,000 students; in the past five years, the region has trained many ethnic minority cadres." Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba added: "We hope that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, Tibet will also develop in all aspects like Inner Mongolia. To this end, we must first solve the transportation problem. We must work together with the People's Liberation Army to repair the roads leading to Tibet as soon as possible, promote the exchange of materials internally and externally, and strive to further develop the economy, politics, and culture of Tibet."

Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba was very moved that religious beliefs were protected in Inner Mongolia and Northeast China. He said: "We saw that many temples in Inner Mongolia were well protected. When we visited the Ganzhuur Temple, which was founded more than 160 years ago, in Xin Barag Left Banner, we held a forum with the lamas. They introduced us in detail to Chairman Mao's policies of ethnic regional autonomy and freedom of religious belief."

Seeing the prosperity and happy life in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia today, the representatives deeply felt that this was inseparable from Chairman Mao's leadership and the heroic struggle of the people of all ethnic groups united. Gesang Wangdui and Dingjia, deputy head of the Tibetan Delegation, said: "We visited the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall and the Wan Zhong Tomb in Harbin and Lushun. When we prayed for the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to resist Japanese imperialism, we remembered that our Tibetan people also had deeds of fighting against imperialist aggression: as early as 1904, the monks and lay people of Tibet bravely resisted the British imperialist aggression in Jiangzi, and more than 4,000 people were massacred by the imperialists. The history of imperialist aggression against our motherland shows that imperialism is the deadly enemy of all ethnic groups in our motherland. In the future, we Tibetan people must unite with the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, follow the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, resolutely drive the forces of imperialist aggression out of Tibet, and build Tibet even better."

    西藏致敬团和昌都藏族国庆节观礼代表团的代表们
    盛赞东北和内蒙古各族人民的幸福生活
    【新华社沈阳七日电】西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴和昌都地区藏族人民国庆节观礼代表团团长格桑旺堆等人，在结束东北和内蒙古地区的参观后，向本社记者发表谈话。他们盛赞东北地区和内蒙古地区解放以后经济的恢复和发展，以及各族人民在毛主席英明领导下所获得的幸福生活。
    柳霞·土登塔巴说：我们从十一月十一日到现在，参观了内蒙古自治区的海拉尔市、新巴尔虎左翼旗及东北的哈尔滨、旅大、沈阳等市。我们亲眼看到东北和内蒙古自治区的人民在人民政府的领导下，积极劳动，从日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮所制造的废墟上，在短短几年的时间里，就已经建设起无数个规模宏大的现代化的工厂。在这一期间，私人工商业也有很大发展，如哈尔滨同记商场，在日本帝国主义统治时期仅剩二十四名店员，营业情况奄奄一息，可是现在在人民政府保护与扶助下，资金已达一百五十多亿元人民币，店员也增加近两倍。
    代表们对东北和内蒙古人民的热忱欢迎，都表示很受感动。格桑旺堆说：“我们二十多天来，到达内蒙古和东北的任何一个车站，都受到当地人民政府首长和各族人民的热烈欢迎，并亲切地向我们介绍情况。当我们参观哈尔滨市和内蒙古的托儿所时，两周岁以上的孩子，都为我们唱歌、舞蹈，表示民族的友爱。旅大文工团的很多男女青年，整天和我们互相学习民族歌舞，当我们离开他们时，都依依难舍。这种兄弟般的友爱，使我们感到祖国大家庭的温暖。”
    代表们对内蒙古今天的成就特别感到兴奋。因为他们认为西藏和内蒙古的经济、文化等方面的情况原来是差不多的。但是今天的内蒙古却大不相同了。格桑旺堆说：今天内蒙古人民在毛主席的帮助下，已建立起牛奶工厂、发电厂、皮革厂；在荒漠的牧区里盖起了可以容纳五百多学生的新学校，海拉尔是一个三万人口的城市，就有学生五千名；五年来全区培养了很多民族干部。柳霞·土登塔巴补充说：“我们希望西藏地区在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，也像内蒙古这样在各方面发展起来，为此，首先必须解决交通问题。我们要和人民解放军同心协力，把通往西藏的公路快些修好，促使物资内外交流，为进一步发展西藏地区的经济、政治、文化而努力。”
    柳霞·土登塔巴对内蒙古和东北地区宗教信仰受到保护，很为感动。他说：我们在内蒙看到很多寺庙被保护得很好。我们到新巴尔虎左翼旗参观时，并和创建一百六十多年的甘珠尔庙的喇嘛举行了座谈。他们向我们详细地介绍了毛主席的民族区域自治和宗教信仰自由的政策。
    代表们看到东北和内蒙古今天的繁荣和幸福生活，都深刻感觉到这是与毛主席的领导和各民族人民团结起来英勇斗争分不开的。格桑旺堆和西藏致敬团副团长定甲说：我们曾在哈尔滨、旅顺参观了东北烈士馆和万忠墓。我们在祈念为抗击日本帝国主义而牺牲的烈士时，想起我们藏族人民也有过反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争事迹：远在一九零四年，西藏僧俗人民，在江孜地方英勇抗击英帝国主义的侵略曾被帝国主义屠杀了四千多人。从帝国主义者侵略我们祖国的历史中，说明了帝国主义是我们祖国各民族的死敌。我们西藏人民今后要和祖国各兄弟民族的人民团结一起，遵循关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，坚决驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏，把西藏建设的更美好。
