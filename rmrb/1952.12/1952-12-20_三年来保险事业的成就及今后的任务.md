    Achievements and Future Tasks of the Insurance Industry in the Past Three Years
    By Wu Bo, General Manager of the People's Insurance Company of China
    The people's insurance industry is an economic undertaking that has rapidly developed in our country after the Chinese people overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary regime and achieved a nationwide revolutionary victory, in order to meet the needs of national economic construction.

    Before liberation, imperialism monopolized China's insurance market. After liberation, this situation fundamentally changed. We gradually established an independent and self-reliant, nationally unified New Democratic national insurance system. Private insurance companies, under the leadership of the state insurance company, also jointly served the development of national economic construction. As of October this year, the People's Insurance Company of China had established 627 branches and 3,735 agencies throughout the country. Abroad, we have established business relationships with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries such as Czechoslovakia and Poland. On the other hand, we also maintain certain business contacts with capitalist countries and countries in Southeast Asia. Because we correctly implemented the national insurance industry's policy of "protecting state property, ensuring production safety, promoting material exchange, and enhancing people's welfare," and have launched more than 40 types of insurance business, we have established a good insurance reputation both at home and abroad.

    Over the past three years, the role of the people's insurance industry in national economic construction can be explained from the following aspects:

    First, compulsory insurance was implemented for the property of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and state organs to protect the property of the above-mentioned organs and enterprises from accidental losses, and compensation was obtained for accidental losses. In November 1949, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued instructions that state-owned enterprises must be insured. With the increasing development of the national economy, the Government Administration Council promulgated in February 1951 a decision on implementing compulsory property insurance for state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives, as well as compulsory passenger insurance. For more than a year, thanks to the attention of party and government organs at all levels and state-owned enterprises in various places, state-owned enterprise departments and state organs across the country have basically implemented compulsory insurance. According to statistics from three major administrative regions: In the Northeast Region, as of the end of October 1951, all properties within the prescribed insurance scope had been fully insured, with more than 30,000 insured units; in the Central South Region, as of the end of 1951, the industrial key systems had been fully insured, and more than 90% of state organs above the special commissioner level had been insured; in the East China Region, as of the end of September 1951, more than 95% of units above the provincial level in the region and more than 90% at the county level had been insured. Many units have been able to obtain the practical benefits provided by insurance professionals after being insured. Compulsory insurance played a supporting and promoting role in the work of the state in clearing assets and verifying funds. For example, after state-owned enterprises in the Northeast region implemented compulsory insurance, the insurance company proposed that the insured amount should be adjusted according to the full valuation because the property of some insured units had not yet reached the level of full valuation. The enterprises were also willing to fully valuate to obtain sufficient compensation in the event of accidental losses. This fact shows that the implementation of compulsory insurance is beneficial for ensuring production safety and promoting the economic accounting system of state-owned enterprises. However, the insurance premiums for compulsory insurance of state organs' property are entirely paid from the state budget, which is not very cost-effective in terms of financial funding. Whether to continue to hold such insurance in the future remains to be studied.

    Second, insurance work has penetrated into rural areas and established contact with the vast number of farmers. In the current situation where agricultural production still accounts for a large proportion in our country, carrying out agricultural insurance in rural areas is of great significance for promoting the smooth development of the agricultural economy. Over the past three years, the People's Insurance Company of China has launched livestock insurance in rural areas and has also experimentally implemented agricultural crop insurance. Livestock insurance was first trialed in the suburbs of Beijing, Shanghe in Shandong, and Beibei in Chongqing in May 1950, and quickly received the welcome of local farmers and the attention of the government. As of the end of 1951, livestock insurance had been handled in 600 locations across the country, insuring nearly 6 million heads of livestock. By September this year, the number of insured livestock had increased to 11.94 million heads. This not only reduced disaster losses for farmers, but also helped farmers improve livestock feeding management and carry out immunization injections. In addition, the People's Insurance Company of China has also successively trialed agricultural crop insurance in several key areas. Cotton insurance has been trialed in 36 locations in Shandong, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hebei provinces, and Beijing, Xi'an and other cities. In other areas, insurance for small amounts of wheat, rice, sugarcane, tobacco, ramie, grapes, and other crops has been trialed. In the areas where cotton insurance was trialed, farmers expressed their welcome and generally felt that after being insured, production was guaranteed. However, our experience in agricultural insurance is still very inadequate and we need to continue to accumulate experience in this area.

    Third, over the past three years, we have carried out fire insurance in private enterprises and transportation insurance in state-owned and private enterprises. The materials of all insured enterprises have been guaranteed as they should be. According to statistics from 76 cities in Central South, East China, and Northeast China: the number of industrial and commercial households that have been insured accounts for 21.36% of all industrial and commercial households. The marine transportation insurance business serving international trade has had significant effects in ensuring safe transportation and encouraging the import of necessary materials and the export of certain materials. In addition, various personal insurance types launched to enhance the welfare of the working people, such as: passenger accident injury insurance, group personal insurance, and fishermen personal insurance, have also been actively promoted in various places and have received good responses.

    Over the past three years, in the operation of various insurance businesses, we have not only fulfilled the responsibility of compensation after disasters occur, ensured the continuation and expansion of reproduction, and solved the economic difficulties caused by accidental accidents to the working people, but also actively assisted and cooperated with relevant departments in disaster prevention work. The things done in this regard include: disaster prevention inspection, subsidizing disaster prevention expenses, disaster prevention propaganda, and specific instructions for disaster prevention work. Over the past three years, if the disaster prevention expenses subsidized from the insurance premium income are all used to purchase various new types of fire trucks, twelve fire organizations like Beijing's can be established. This disaster prevention subsidy is mainly used to subsidize fire-fighting equipment in cities and to prevent and control livestock diseases in rural areas; in addition, emergency medical kits have been set up on trains and ships. The Southwest Region has set up inspection stations in dangerous sections of the Sichuan River and participated in dredging projects to remove obstacles to navigation. We have also widely carried out disaster prevention publicity and education work in various places to raise the public's vigilance against disasters and have specifically conducted disaster prevention guidance.

    The people's insurance industry has achieved the above-mentioned achievements in the past three years. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work, so that the entire insurance business still cannot keep up with the needs of the rapid development of national economic construction.

    We still have capitalist management methods in insurance business technology. The drafted systems and methods are not easy to understand and the procedures are complicated, resulting in a waste of manpower and material resources. For example, livestock insurance used to require fifteen procedures and twenty forms from underwriting to claims settlement. Simple personal insurance had more than one hundred kinds of documents. Agricultural crop insurance stipulated that farmers should fill out a cultivation plan with dozens of items, which made it impossible for farmers to fill out. We have conducted inspections of these shortcomings in the "Three-Anti" movement, and held a meeting to simplify procedures in July this year, and have carried out preliminary reforms, but this is not enough, and we must continue to work hard to improve in the future.

    In addition, there is a purely business viewpoint in the work, and some staff members have a rather serious mandatory command style and a tendency to be detached from the masses. Some cadres, when handling livestock insurance, forced the masses to take out insurance by extremely bad means in order to complete a certain number, which affected the credibility of the people's insurance industry and damaged the development of the business. The reason why this bad style was not corrected in time is inseparable from our leadership's bureaucracy. In the future, we must wage a resolute struggle against these erroneous ideological styles in order to continuously improve our work.

    In order to welcome the high tide of national economic construction, we must further do the following main tasks on the basis of the past people's insurance business:

    1. Continue to promote the national compulsory insurance business in state-owned enterprises. Increasing production and practicing economy is the main task of various enterprise departments in the future. In order to achieve this task, various enterprise departments are gradually implementing the economic accounting system. The state insurance company must assist them in realizing the economic accounting system through its own business. Therefore, the people's insurance companies in various places should strengthen publicity work in accordance with the national compulsory insurance laws, not only to ensure that every grassroots enterprise unit participates in insurance, but also to gradually achieve full insurance coverage, so that the production of every state-owned enterprise is guaranteed with definite economic security.

    2. Develop agricultural insurance in a planned way. With the continuous development and improvement of agricultural production, the scope of agricultural insurance should also be expanded day by day, but due to our insufficient economy (in the past two years, it has basically been in the stage of key trials), we should take a cautious attitude and cannot rush things. In the next three to five years, we can still only take the approach of key trials. However, we have already been able to further promote livestock insurance, which is the most pressing need for farmers. In the promotion, we must summarize past work experience, gradually improve the business, and ensure that it not only meets the requirements of farmers to protect livestock, but also prevents certain farmers from generating the side effects of not loving livestock.

    3. Continue to develop insurance business in private industrial and commercial enterprises. In order to protect the legitimate operations and interests of private industrial and commercial enterprises and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the national insurance work should also promote various insurance businesses in cities according to different conditions and seasons, especially to promote transportation insurance and fire insurance to private industrial and commercial enterprises on a large scale, so that the insurance business has close ties with the vast number of private industrial and commercial enterprises, thereby playing the positive role of the private capitalist economy at the present stage.

    4. Develop foreign insurance business. On the one hand, we must maintain close business ties with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe. On the other hand, we must strengthen business in capitalist countries and Southeast Asia. At the same time, we should unite the overseas Chinese insurance industry and help them develop their business overseas.

    In order to accomplish the above tasks, the People's Insurance Company of China must strengthen its leadership over joint state-private and private insurance industries so that they can work together for the country's large-scale economic construction. Secondly, the insurance business must be closely integrated with disaster prevention. This is one of the main signs that distinguishes the people's insurance business from the insurance business of capitalist countries. In the past, we have achieved some success in disaster prevention work, and we must continue to cooperate with relevant departments to strengthen this aspect of work in the future. The companies in various places must make the payment of claims rapid and timely so that the insured units or individuals can get more convenience. Third, resolutely oppose the purely task-oriented viewpoint, mandatory commands, and bureaucratic style. Only by thoroughly opposing these bad ideas and styles can we remove the obstacles on the road to the development of the people's insurance industry. The People's Insurance Companies in various places must pay special attention to the ideological education of cadres and overcome the tendency of leading cadres to bury themselves in business without asking about politics. In the future, all cadres should not only strengthen the study of political theory, but also strengthen the study of advanced Soviet experience in order to continuously improve their ideological and professional level. Finally, the cadres of the People's Insurance Companies at all levels are not keeping up with the objective needs in terms of quantity and quality. Therefore, the People's Insurance Companies at all levels must also cultivate and train cadres in a planned way. Only by doing the above work can we complete the great task of the people's insurance business in the future.

    三年来保险事业的成就及今后的任务
    中国人民保险公司总公司经理  吴波
    人民保险事业是我国人民在推翻国民党反动政权、取得全国规模的革命胜利之后，为了适应国家经济建设需要而迅速发展起来的经济事业。
    解放前，帝国主义垄断了我国的保险市场。解放后，这种局面根本改变了。我们逐步建立起独立自主和全国统一的新民主主义的国家保险体系，私营保险公司在国家保险公司的领导下，也共同为发展国家经济建设而服务。至今年十月份止，中国人民保险公司在全国各地已建立有分支机构六百二十七处，代理处三千七百三十五处。在国外，我们已与苏联及捷克斯洛伐克、波兰等人民民主国家建立了业务关系。另方面，我们与资本主义国家及东南亚地区的国家，也保持着一定的业务联系。由于我们正确执行了国家保险事业“保护国家财产、保障生产安全、促进物资交流、增进人民福利”的方针，先后举办了四十余种保险业务，无论在国内国外，都已树立了良好的保险信誉。
    三年来，人民保险事业在国家经济建设中所起的作用，可以从以下几个方面来加以说明。
    第一、对国营企业、合作社和国家机关的财产，实行了强制保险，保护上述机关、企业财产免受意外损失，遭受了意外损失的，也获得了补偿。一九四九年十一月政务院财政经济委员会发出了国营企业必须保险的指示；随着国家经济日益发展，政务院又于一九五一年二月颁布了关于实行国家机关、国营企业、合作社财产强制保险及旅客强制保险的决定。一年多来，由于各级党政机关与各地国营企业的重视，全国各地国营企业部门和国家机关基本上都已实行了强制保险。根据三个大行政区的统计：东北区截至一九五一年十月底止，所有在规定投保范围内的财产已全部投保，投保单位达三万余个；中南区截至一九五一年底，工业重点系统已全部投保，专署以上国家机关投保的达百分之九十以上；华东区截至一九五一年九月底，全区省级以上单位投保的已达百分之九十五，县级达百分之九十以上。许多单位在投保后，已经得以了保险专业所给予的实际利益。强制保险对于国家清理资产核定资金的工作起了配合、推动作用。如东北区的国营企业实行强制保险后，保险公司因某些投保单位的财产尚未达到十足估价的程度，提出了须按十足估价调整保险金额的要求，各企业也愿意十足估价，以便发生意外损失时，得到足够的补偿。这种事实说明：强制保险的实行，对于保障生产安全、推行国营企业的经济核算制是有良好使用的。但国家机关财产的强制保险，其保险费完全是由国家预算中支付的，在财政资金合作上来说是不大合算的，今后是否继续举办此种保险，尚待研究。
    第二、保险工作深入农村，与广大农民发生联系。在目前我国农业生产还占着很大比重的情况下，我们在农村举办农业保险，对于促进农业经济顺利的发展有着重大的意义。三年来，中国人民保险公司已在农村中开展了牲畜保险，并试办了农业作物保险。牲畜保险在一九五零年五月间首先在北京郊区、山东商河、重庆北碚等地试办，很快就得到了当地农民的欢迎和政府的重视。截至一九五一年底，全国已有六百个地点办理牲畜保险，承保牲畜将近六百万头，至今年九月承保牲畜已增至一千一百九十四万头。这不仅给农民减少了灾害损失，而且还帮助农民改善了牲畜的饲养管理，并进行防疫注射。此外，中国人民保险公司还在若干地区先后重点试办了农作物保险。在山东、江苏、陕西、山西、四川、江西、河北等省及北京、西安等市共三十六个地点，试办了棉花保险。在另一些地区，试办了小型的小麦、水稻、甘蔗、烟草、苎麻、葡萄等作物的保险。在试办棉花保险的地区，农民都表示欢迎，他们普遍感到投保之后，生产有了保障。但是我们在农业保险方面的经验还是很不够的，须要继续积累这方面的经验。
    第三、三年来，我们在私营企业中举办火灾保险，在国营以及私营企业中举办运输保险，凡投保的企业的物资都获得了应有的保障。根据中南、华东、东北七十六个城市的统计：已投保的工商户占全部工商户的百分之二十一点三六。为国际贸易服务的海上运输保险业务，在保障安全运输，鼓励必要物资进口以某些物资的出口上，都有显著效果。此外，为增进劳动人民福利而举办的各种人身保险，例如：旅客意外伤害保险、团体人身保险以及渔工人身保险等，亦在各地积极推行，得到了良好的反映。
    三年来我们在经营各种保险业务中，不仅履行了发生灾害以后实行赔偿责任，保证了再生产的持续与扩大，解决了劳动人民因意外事故所造成的经济困难，同时还从积极方面协助与配合有关部门进行了防灾工作。在这方面所做的事情，包括：防灾检查、补助防灾费用、防灾宣传与具体指示防灾工作。三年来，我们从保险费收入项下拨付的补助防灾费用，如果全部用于购买各种新式的消防汽车，可以建立十二个像北京的消防组织。此项防灾补助费用，在城市主要是补助消防设备，在农村则用于防治牲畜病害；此外，在火车、轮船上设置了救急药箱，西南区曾在川江各滩险地段设置检验站，并参加进行淘滩工程，清除船行障碍。我们在各地还普遍进行了防灾宣传教育工作，提高群众对灾害的警惕，并具体进行了防灾指导。
    三年来的人民保险事业获得了上述成绩。但工作中还是有很多缺点，以致使整个保险业务还赶不上国家经济建设迅速发展的需要。
    我们在保险业务技术上还存在着资本主义经营方法，拟定的制度，办法不通俗，手续复杂，造成人力、物力的浪费。如牲畜保险，过去从承保到赔款，要经过十五道手续，使用二十种表格，简易人身保险有一百余种单据，农作物保险规定要农民填写耕作计划书，并有几十个项目，使农民无法填写。这些缺点，在“三反”运动中我们曾进行了检查，今年七月又召开了简化手续会议，已进行了初步的改革，但这是不够的，今后还须继续努力改进。
    此外，工作中还存在着单纯业务观点，有些工作人员并有相当严重的强迫命令作风与脱离群众的倾向。有的干部在办理牲畜保险时，为了完成一定数字，竟用极恶劣的手段强迫群众进行保险，影响了人民保险事业的信誉，破坏了业务的开展。这种恶劣的作风之所以没有及时得到纠正，是与我们领导上的官僚主义分不开的。今后我们必须和这些错误的思想作风进行坚决的斗争，以便不断地提高工作。
    为迎接全国经济建设高潮，必须在过去人民保险事业的基础上，进一步做好下列几项主要工作：
    一、在国营企业中继续推行国家强制保险业务。增产节约是各企业部门今后主要的任务，为了实现这个任务，各企业部门正逐步实行经济核算制。国家保险公司要通过自己的业务协助它们实现经济核算制。因此，各地人民保险公司应当依照国家强制保险的法令，加强宣传工作，不仅要使每一个基层企业单位都参加投保，而且要逐步做到足额投保，使每一个国营企业的生产都得到确切的经济保障。
    二、有计划地开展农业保险。随着农业生产的不断发展与提高，农业保险的范围也要日益扩大，但由于我们经济不足（过去两年多来，基本上是处在重点试办的阶段），应该采取慎重的态度，不能操之过急。在今后三、五年内，仍然只能是采取重点试办的方针。但对农民要求最迫切的牲畜保险，我们则已有可能进一步加以推广。在推广中必须总结过去的工作经验，逐步改进业务，要做以既能符合农民保护牲畜的要求，又要防止某些农民可能产生的不爱护牲畜的副作用。
    三、在私营工商业中继续开展保险业务。为了保障私营工商业正当的经营和利益，并促进城乡内外物资的交流，国家保险工作，还应该根据不同条件、不同季节在城市中推行各种保险业务，特别是对私营工商业大量推广运输保险与火灾保险，使保险业务与广大私营工商业发生密切联系，从而发挥私人资本主义经济在现阶段的积极作用。
    四、开展国外保险业务。一方面要与苏联及东欧各人民民主国家在业务上保持密切联系，一方面要在资本主义国家及东南亚地区加强业务。同时并应团结海外华侨的保险业，帮助他们在海外开展业务。
    为了完成以上工作，中国人民保险公司必须加强对公私合营和私营保险业的领导，使它们共同为国家大规模经济建设而努力。其次，必须使保险业务与防灾密切结合。这是人民保险事业区别于资本主义国家保险事业的主要标志之一。过去在防灾工作上我们已经取得了一些成绩，今后必须继续配合有关部门加强这一方面的工作。各地公司对于赔款的支付，必须做到迅速、及时，使投保单位或个人得到更多的便利。第三、坚决反对单纯任务观点、强迫命令和官僚主义作风。只有彻底反对这些不良思想和作风，才能扫除了人民保险事业发展道路上的障碍。各地人民保险公司必须特别注意干部思想教育，克服领导干部埋头钻业务而不问政治的倾向。今后全体干部除加强政治理论学习外，还要加强对苏联先进经验的学习，以便不断地提高自己的思想水平和业务水平。最后，目前各级人民保险公司的干部，无论在数量上、质量上，都赶不上客观的需要，因此各级人民保险公司还必须有计划地培养、训练干部。只有做好以上的工作，才能完成人民保障事业今后的伟大任务。
