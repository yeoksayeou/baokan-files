Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The China Peace Committee and various national people's organizations recently held a joint meeting to select the Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress. The meeting was attended by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman, and Li Siguang, Mao Dun, Ma Xulun, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Peng Zemin, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao San, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Mei Ru'ao, Liu Guanyi, Lai Ruoyu, Cao Mengjun, Qian Sanqiang, Sha Qianli, Ji Chaoding, Fu Lianzhang, Ni Feijun, Hou Debang, Zhu Shihe and others, all standing committee members of the China Peace Committee and heads of various people's organizations.
    Song Qingling, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and a renowned peace advocate, participated in the meeting.
    The meeting unanimously elected the Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, electing Song Qingling as the head of the delegation, Guo Moruo as the deputy head, Liu Ningyi as the secretary-general, and Liu Guanyi and four others as deputy secretaries-general.
    Guo Moruo and Liu Ningyi spoke at the meeting, discussing the significance of the World People's Peace Congress. Guo Moruo said: This meeting is extremely important because, on the one hand, the United States is stepping up preparations for war, and on the other hand, the people of the world urgently demand peace. The important topics to be discussed at the meeting are: (1) Ending the wars currently underway, (2) Ending the Cold War, and (3) Ensuring national independence and international security. The World People's Peace Congress will absorb a very wide range of representatives, and the participation of a broadly representative Chinese delegation is of great significance to the success of the meeting. Liu Ningyi pointed out: Defending peace is the urgent demand of the people of all countries, and this congress will absorb many people who have never participated in the peace movement, turning the defense of peace into the unanimous wish of the people of the world. The recently held Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was an important step in the preparation for the congress, and the issue of national independence raised at this conference is also an important issue for the oppressed people of the world. Raising the banner of national independence will more broadly mobilize the people of all countries to defend peace and national independence.
    Representatives of various people's organizations who spoke at the meeting unanimously expressed their support for the convening of the World People's Peace Congress and earnestly wished the congress a success. Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: This congress will continue to expose the schemes of the warmongers, mobilize the people of all countries to defend peace, and strengthen the unity of all countries. The Chinese working class needs peace and the support of the people of all countries in order to build the motherland. We will also support the peace struggle of the people of all countries by strengthening peaceful construction. Cao Mengjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, pointed out that the convening of the congress is in the interests of Chinese women and is convinced that the congress will achieve great success. She hopes that the Chinese delegation will bring the support and hope of Chinese women to the congress, and bring back to China the hope and efforts of the people of the world to defend peace. Zhu Shihe, a representative of the All-China Students' Federation, said that Chinese students warmly support the convening of the congress and will do everything possible to support the congress. Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out the importance of the congress and said: The Chinese delegation will have extensive contact with representatives of all countries at the congress and play an active role in the success of the meeting. Chen Shutong represented the business community in supporting the convening of the congress, saying: The concerted efforts of representatives of all countries have made the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference a great success and played an important role in the cause of world peace. "Unite as one, defend world peace," the World People's Peace Congress will surely succeed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 11th: The Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, led by the head of the delegation, Song Qingling, and the deputy head, Guo Moruo, arrived in Vienna on the 11th and was warmly welcomed by members of the World Peace Council and peace representatives from various countries.
    The Chinese delegation was elected by the China Peace Committee and various national people's organizations in China.
