    Facts Expose
    ——"Pravda" Editorial in the Soviet Union

    The U.S. State Department is clearly restless and sleepless.

    The special agencies of the US intelligence service stationed in various peace-loving democratic countries have failed one after another. Under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the working people of the People's Democratic countries vigilantly defend the fruits of their victory. They are exposing and eliminating the nests of American and British secret agents.

    Each new trial of enemy agents in the People's Democratic countries reveals that the ruling circles of the United States are the organizers of espionage and sabotage activities against the countries of the peace-loving democratic camp.

    Those who instigate these wicked anti-national conspiracies have reached the end of the road and are trying to cover up the traces of their crimes. The recently published note from the U.S. State Department to the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic is for this purpose. This "document" attempts to deny that U.S. intelligence agencies have established nests of spies and saboteurs on the territory of peace-loving countries. However, the whole world knows that since the U.S. Congress passed the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," allocating 100 million U.S. dollars for spies and saboteurs to engage in activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the scale of these subversive activities has been particularly extensive.

    The authors of the aforementioned note, using the honeyed words and deceptive methods commonly used by American politicians, hypocritically say that the United States has absolutely not engaged in any aggressive activities in violation of the United Nations Charter, and that the purpose of allocating 100 million U.S. dollars is not for such activities... This money is used to provide humanitarian assistance to exiles… As for the diplomatic representatives of the United States abroad, as the U.S. note attempts to assert, they have nothing to do with the aforementioned espionage and terrorist centers. It is said that they are busy fulfilling their duties.

    Look, this is an example of showing the hypocritical face of an aggressor! Everyone, look, the organizers of espionage, sabotage, and other serious crimes across the Atlantic prefer to spend money buying murderers, spies, and other American agents and placing them in peace-loving countries, calling it humanitarian assistance to exiles.

    However, the attempts of American espionage and sabotage organizers to cover up their criminal traces will never succeed! Facts, undeniable facts, expose the heinous conspiracies and bloody crimes of these big shots who endanger the peace and security of all countries!

    In the world, only the U.S. government has passed and implemented laws that stipulate—as the "Mutual Security Act of 1951" states—that "any selected person" who is sent to peace-loving countries and can be used as an employee of the heads of the North Atlantic Group and used to achieve "other purposes" will be given funding; this is a fact.

    It is a fact that on the territory of the United States, Hitler fascists, Polish, Czechoslovak, and other traitors hiding under the protection of the American authorities, as well as other dregs of humanity, are being formed into a special military unit. This unit is trained to take despicable terrorist actions against the people of freedom-loving countries. According to Karlstan, one of the drafters of the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," the task of this group of bandits, formed by the American military into a special "force," is to spread terror among the people. And the actions of funding and training these bandits are described by Washington politicians as providing humanitarian assistance to exiles! … Isn't it a fact that the ruling circles of the United States directly direct the criminal activities of espionage and sabotage nests established by the U.S. intelligence agencies on the territory of sovereign countries that have established diplomatic relations with the United States? The trials of espionage centers and spy groups conducted in Poland, Hungary, China, Bulgaria, and other countries in recent years have irrefutably proved that the criminal activities of these groups were directed by the American and British military intelligence agencies. Kostov, Rajk, and Slánský, the spy organization active in the Polish army, the subversive organizations and groups established on the territory of the People's Republic of China, and the conspiracy centers in other People's Democratic countries, the strings of their criminal conspiracies are all pulled from Washington. U.S. diplomatic and military representatives everywhere actively participated in arranging these anti-national conspiracies.

    The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic pointed out in a statement on November 24, 1951: "According to various documents, whenever the fascist and pro-fascist reactionaries in Hungary plot to overthrow the domestic democratic system, agents sent by the U.S. government, and even many diplomatic and other representatives holding official government positions, actively participate in these conspiracies, and are the instigators and leaders of these conspiracies."

    In Romania, American political representative Balten Berley, the head of the American military delegation, General Cortland Van Schuyler, advisers Elo Melbourne and Charlie Hulick, and many other American diplomats and official representatives have been exposed as agents of the U.S. intelligence agencies. The trial currently underway in Prague of the anti-national conspiracy center headed by Slánský, a special agent of U.S. imperialism, has revealed new facts that prove that U.S. diplomats and senior U.S. government officials directly participated in this conspiracy.

    However, Washington arbitrarily says that U.S. diplomatic representatives stationed abroad are just fulfilling their duties. In this case, a question naturally arises, what exactly are the "duties" of U.S. diplomatic representatives stationed abroad?

    The U.S. government's allocation of funds for foreign espionage activities is only a part of the huge sums of money spent by the U.S. imperialist groups on these criminal purposes. In addition to budgetary appropriations borne by U.S. taxpayers, U.S. monopoly capitalists privately contribute large amounts of money to support espionage and sabotage activities.

    According to the American magazine "U.S. News & World Report," in 1951 alone, the largest American monopoly enterprises—DuPont, Mellon, General Motors, and other large companies—gave more than 350 million U.S. dollars to various reactionary organizations engaged in subversive activities against peace-loving countries. For example, the "Ford Foundation," once led by the notorious George Kennan, is one of these organizations. Cultivating spies, murderers, and saboteurs—this is the real activity of organizations like the "Ford Foundation," which is praised by the warmongers' newspapers as a "freedom crusade."

    The hypocritical attitude of Washington's demagogues wearing the guise of "freedom fighters" has aroused indignation among millions of people everywhere, including the United States. For example, the Louisville "Courier-Journal" published a letter from a reader named Ford, who wrote in a fair and sarcastic tone: The "freedom crusade" generously funded and greatly publicized by big entrepreneurs means that the United States has too much freedom and is happy to export the remaining freedom abroad... Ford pointed out: Millions of awakened people in Europe and Asia have a definite concept of what freedom is. This concept includes not only freedom of thought, speech, and publication, but especially the freedom of the people from exploitation, from economic crises, from unemployment and poverty... Europe and Asia have indeed lost certain rights and freedoms: the freedom of landlords and capitalists to continue to enslave 800 million people. Ford pointed out: This is the pseudo-"freedom" that the rich American crusaders are trying to restore.

    Terror and sabotage are the weapons of those who are doomed to perish. Only those who feel isolated from the people and know that their plans are hated by the people use this weapon. The plans of the American aggressors, which are opposed by all progressive mankind and are hostile to mankind, are precisely such plans.

    The criminal conspiracies of Washington's sabotage instigators and the bandits they hire are doomed to failure. The unshakable stability of the People's Democratic system and the high revolutionary vigilance of the free people, the Communist Party and the Workers' Party are a guarantee of this.

    The people of all countries know that the more hopeless the cause of the enemies of peace, the more often they resort to "extreme means" of struggle. The peace-loving democratic camp responds to the criminal conspiracies of the imperialist reactionaries by increasing vigilance and strengthening the unity of their ranks.

    事实向人们揭露
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    美国国务院显然已在寝食不安了。
    美国情报机关安置在各和平民主国家的特务机关接二连三地失败了。在共产党和工人党的领导下，人民民主国家的劳动人民警惕地保卫着他们的胜利果实，他们正在揭露和铲除美—英秘密特务的巢穴。
    人民民主国家中每一次新的敌人特务审判案都揭露出美国上层统治集团是和平民主阵营各国的间谍和破坏活动的组织者。
    主使罪恶的反国家阴谋的人穷途末路，竟试图把他们犯罪的痕迹盖起来。最近公布的美国国务院致捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府的照会就是为了这个目的。这个“文件”企图否认美国情报机关曾在爱好和平各国的领土上建立间谍和破坏者的巢穴。不过，全世界都知道，自从美国国会通过了“一九五一年共同安全法”，拨款一亿美元供给间谍和破坏分子从事反对苏联和人民民主国家的活动以后，这些颠覆性活动的规模就特别广泛了。
    上述照会的作者，使用美国政客们所惯用的笼络人心和欺骗的方法，假仁假义地说：美国绝对没有从事任何违反联合国宪章的侵略活动，同时拨款一亿美元的目的也不是为了从事这种活动………这笔款子是用来给流亡者……以人道的援助的。至于美国驻国外的外交代表，如美国照会试图断定的，他们和上述间谍恐怖分子中心毫无关系。据说，他们都是忙于履行他们的职务。
    看，这就是一个表明侵略者的伪善面孔的例子！大家看，大西洋彼岸的间谍、破坏活动和其他严重罪行的组织者是痛恨直言不讳的。他们宁愿出钱收买杀人犯、间谍和其他美国特务并将他们安置在爱好和平的国家的行动说成是给流亡者以人道的援助。
    然而美国的间谍和恐怖活动组织者想掩盖他们犯罪痕迹的企图是决不会成功的！事实、不容置辩的事实，揭露了这些大人先生们危害各国和平与安全的罪恶阴谋和血腥罪行！
    世界上，只有美国政府通过了并实施了一些法律，这些法律规定——如“一九五一年共同安全法”所说的——：“任何经过挑选的人”，凡是被派往爱好和平各国去的，并且可以用作北大西洋集团头子们的被雇佣者和用以达到“其他目的”的，都给以资助；这是事实。
    在美国的领土上，正在将希特勒法西斯分子，波兰的、捷克斯洛伐克的、和其他在美国当局卵翼下藏身的叛徒以及人类的其他渣滓组成一支特种军事部队，这是事实。这种部队所受的训练就是对爱好自由的各国人民采取卑鄙的恐怖行动。据“一九五一年共同安全法”的起草人之一卡尔斯坦说，这一群被美国军方组成特殊“部队”的匪类的任务就是在人民中散布恐怖。而资助和训练这些匪帮的行动却被华盛顿的政客们说成是给予流亡者以人道的援助！……美国上层统治集团直接指导着美国情报机关在已与美国建立外交关系的各主权国家的领土上建立的间谍和破坏分子巢穴的罪恶活动，这难道不是事实吗？近年来，在波兰、匈牙利、中国、保加利亚和其他国家所进行的对间谍中心和间谍集团的审判，都不容争辩地证明了这些集团的罪恶活动是美国和英国军事情报机关所指导的。柯斯托夫、拉伊克和斯兰斯基，在波兰军队中活动的间谍组织，在中华人民共和国领土上建立的颠覆性组织和集团，以及其他人民民主国家里的阴谋中心，他们的罪恶阴谋的引线都是从华盛顿牵引出来的。美国的外交代表和军事代表在每一个地方都积极参与布置这些反国家的阴谋。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府在一九五一年十一月二十四日的声明中指出：“据各种文件证明，每当匈牙利的法西斯和亲法西斯反动分子布置阴谋、企图推翻国内民主制度时，美国政府所派来的特务，甚至许多担任政府正式职务的外交代表和其他代表都积极参加这些阴谋，而且都是这些阴谋的主使人和领导者。”
    在罗马尼亚，美国的政治代表巴尔腾·柏利、美国军事代表团团长考特兰·范·许勒将军、顾问伊罗·梅尔邦和查利·胡利克以及许多其他美国的外交官和正式代表都已被揭露了身份，原来是美国间谍机关的特务。目前在布拉格进行的以美帝国主义特务斯兰斯基为首的反国家阴谋中心的领导核心一案的审判，又使一些新的事实大白于世，证明美国的外交官和美国的高级政府官员曾直接参与这个阴谋。
    然而，华盛顿方面却武断地说，美国驻在国外的外交代表只是履行他们的职务罢了。在这种情形之下，有一个问题自然而然地发生了，这就是美国驻在国外的外交代表的“职务”到底是什么呢？
    美国政府拨充国外间谍活动的经费只是美国帝国主义集团花费在这些犯罪目的上面的巨额金钱的一部分罢了。除了由美国纳税人负担的预算拨款之外，美国垄断资本家私下还拿出大量的金钱来支持间谍和破坏活动。
    据美国杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”承认，一九五一年单是美国最大的垄断企业——杜邦的公司、梅隆的公司、通用汽车公司以及其他大公司——就给了各种对爱好和平国家从事颠覆性活动的反动组织三亿五千万以上的美元。譬如，一度曾由臭名远扬的乔治·凯南领导的“福特基金会”就是这些组织中的一个。培植间谍、杀人犯和破坏分子——这就是像“福特基金会”这样的组织真正的活动，而战争贩子御用的报纸却把它誉为“自由十字军”。
    穿着“自由战士”这种外衣的华盛顿愚民者的伪善态度引起了包括美国在内的各地千百万人民的愤慨。例如，路易斯维尔的“信使日报”刊载了一个叫福特的读者的来信，他用一种公正的讽刺笔调写道：大企业家慷慨资助并且大事宣传的“自由十字军”意味着美国的自由太多了，乐得把剩余的自由输出到国外去……福特指出：欧洲和亚洲千百万觉醒的人民对于自由是什么有一个确定的概念。这个概念不仅包括思想、言论和出版的自由，而且特别包括人民免于被剥削的自由，免于经济危机、免于失业和贫穷的自由……欧洲和亚洲的确已经丧失了某些权利和自由：地主和资本家使八亿人民继续处于奴隶地位的自由。福特指出：这正是美国有钱的十字军企图恢复的伪“自由”。
    恐怖和破坏乃是注定要灭亡的人们的武器。只有那些感觉到已与人民隔绝、知道自己的计划遭到人民厌恶的人们，才使用这种武器。全体进步人类所坚决反对的、美国侵略者与人类为敌的计划恰恰就是这样的计划。
    华盛顿的破坏活动主使者和他们雇用的匪徒的罪恶阴谋，是注定要失败的。人民民主制度不可动摇的稳固性以及自由人民、共产党和工人党的高度革命警惕，乃是这一点的保证。
    各国人民知道：和平公敌的事业越是没有希望，他们就越是经常采取斗争的“极端手段”。和平民主阵营用提高警惕和加强自己队伍的团结这种方法来回答帝国主义反动派的罪恶阴谋。
