	Poland Marches Towards Socialism
	—On the "Poland Building a Socialist Society" Exhibition
		Chen Wei
	A dense forest of house-building scaffolding, cranes stretching out their long arms, piles of construction materials, a constant stream of freight trucks and worker-carrying trams, and hard-working construction workers, with tall buildings already standing on the construction site... This is the scene depicted in a more-than-life-size photograph displayed at the "Poland Building a Socialist Society" exhibition. This photograph not only vividly portrays the situation of the Polish people building their glorious capital, Warsaw, but can also be said to be an epitome of Poland, which is booming with socialist construction today.
	After the heroic Soviet army liberated the Polish people from the enslavement of Hitler's fascism in 1944, Poland entered a new historical stage. We can see from the pictures in the exhibition: the Polish people warmly welcome their liberators; the Soviet people sent machines and raw materials to help the Polish people recover from the ravages of war as soon as possible; Soviet combine harvesters gallop in the fields of Poland; packages of Soviet cotton are unloaded from ships in Polish ports; huge Soviet cranes are helping the Polish people rebuild their homes and cities. At the same time, the Soviet people also introduced their advanced experience and brilliant culture and art to the Polish people: the famous Soviet female worker Kolabelnikova taught Polish workers her experience in saving shoemaking materials, Soviet scientists lectured in Poland, and the famous Soviet "Birenzhaven Workers' Troupe" performed in Poland. It is perfectly understandable that the exhibition puts this series of pictures at the forefront, which shows that the friendship between the Soviet and Polish people and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to Poland are important guarantees for the Polish people to gain independence and freedom and strive for a happy life.
	After liberation, the workers, peasants, women and youth of Poland were organized. They established their own organizations and closely united around the Polish United Workers' Party and Comrade Beirut, and began to struggle for the revival and construction of their motherland. After completing the 1947-1949 Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they started the large-scale construction Six-Year Plan in 1950. After the completion of this plan, Poland's industrial output will increase by more than four times compared with 1938, and Poland will therefore become a strong and prosperous industrial country. The economic foundation for Poland's march towards socialism will also be laid.
	In the first three years of the Six-Year Plan, the Polish people have achieved great success. Many pictures in the exhibition illustrate this point: the "Jestochova" steel plant, with an annual steel output of 1.1 million tons, has started operation; the steelmaking furnace of the "Nova Huta" metallurgical plant, the first socialist city in Poland, is pouring out the first furnace of molten steel. When this steel center is fully constructed and put into operation, its annual output will exceed the total steel output of Poland before the war; the "Zheran" automobile factory, newly built in the suburbs of Warsaw, is producing batches of passenger cars modeled after the Soviet "Victory" car.
	The great achievements Poland has made in industrial construction have also brought great benefits to agriculture. Tens of thousands of agricultural machines have poured out of factories and driven to the fields, bringing a bumper harvest to the collective farms. By 1955, the countryside of Poland will have 61,000 tractors, five times more than in 1944.
	When the people constantly achieve victories in production with their hardworking hands and wisdom, their lives become happier day by day. Now one-third of Poland's national budget is used for cultural and educational construction. The people's democratic regime has opened up infinitely bright prospects for the vast number of children and young people. Now children under the age of 14 in Poland are required to receive compulsory education, and schools have opened their doors to the children of workers and laboring peasants. In 1952, 70% of the freshmen in universities across Poland were children of workers and peasants, and 6 million people across the country participated in various studies. Even elderly men and women in their fifties and sixties are studying tirelessly.
	Poland is a nation with a glorious and brilliant cultural tradition. It has contributed great scientists and artists such as Copernicus, Madame Curie, and Chopin to human civilization. The Polish people especially cherish this glorious cultural tradition. People can see from the pictures that the works of the great patriot and musician Chopin are being widely played, historical cultural relics are being protected and cherished, famous classical dramas are being staged in theaters, sculptors are carefully creating their works, and young men and women are choosing their favorite books....
	In other pictures, workers in twos and threes are raising the sails of yachts, preparing for weekend excursions; many workers are enjoying free treatment; and children in nurseries are happily singing and dancing. In the pictures, a sentence by Comrade Beirut is particularly eye-catching:
	"It is our sacred responsibility to arrange a simple and comfortable family for people, to create a more fulfilling life, and a happier future." This sentence fully expresses the infinite care of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people's leader for the Polish people.
	The exhibition uses a large number of pictures to show the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people. The first thing people see is a photograph of the "May Day" parade - among the images of leaders of various countries held high by the masses during the parade, there is a huge image of Chairman Mao Zedong, who is respected by the Polish people. In the past three years, the economic and cultural relations between the Chinese and Polish people have become closer day by day. We see the "Peace" merchant ship loaded with Polish industrial products setting sail for our country, Polish students in China are focusing on learning Chinese, and Chinese students in Poland are holding hands and singing intimately with Polish friends at evening parties. There is also a brightly colored picture showing that the trade volume between China and Poland in 1951 has increased by more than 20 times compared with before the war.
	In the two tall glass cabinets of the exhibition, there are also many Polish national costumes, daily necessities and books, including the Polish translation of Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War", and books written by famous Polish writers and journalists such as "The Birth of New China", "In New China", and "Impressions of New China", which show the Polish people's concern for the Chinese people's struggle and life.
	The "Poland Building a Socialist Society" exhibition clearly introduces to the audience the great achievements Poland has made in construction and its prospects for moving towards a socialist society. This exhibition will enable the people of our country to further understand this fraternal country on the coast of the Baltic Sea, thereby enhancing the understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Polish people.

### 波兰向社会主义迈进——记“正在建设社会主义社会的波兰”展览会

    波兰向社会主义迈进
    ——记“正在建设社会主义社会的波兰”展览会
  　陈维
    密密层层的房屋建筑木架，伸着长臂的起重机，成堆的建筑器材，络绎不断的运货卡车和搭载工人的电车，紧张劳动着的建筑工人，已经在工地上矗立起来的一幢幢高楼大厦……这是陈列在“正在建设社会主义社会的波兰”展览会里的一幅一人多高的照片中的图景。这幅照片不仅生动地表现出波兰人民正在建设他们光荣首都华沙的情形，同时也可以说是今天正在蓬勃地建设着社会主义的波兰的一个缩影。
    英勇的苏联军队在一九四四年把波兰人民从希特勒法西斯的奴役下解放出来以后，波兰就开始进入了一个新的历史阶段。我们可以从展览会的图片中看到：波兰人民热烈地欢迎他们的解放者；苏联人民为了帮助波兰人民早日恢复战争的创伤而送来了机器和原料；苏联的联合收割机骋驰在波兰的田野上；一包包的苏联棉花在波兰港口从船上卸运下来；巨大的苏联起重机在帮助波兰人民重建他们的家园和城市。同时，苏联人民还把自己的先进经验和光辉的文化艺术介绍给波兰人民：著名的苏联女工科拉贝尔尼科娃向波兰工人传授自己节约制鞋原料的经验，苏联科学家在波兰讲学，著名的苏联“比伦兹哈文工团”在波兰表演。展览会把这一系列图片放在最前列是完全可以理解的，这说明了苏波两国人民的友谊和苏联对波兰的无私援助，就是波兰人民获得独立自由与争取幸福美满生活的重要保证。
    解放以后，波兰的工人、农民、妇女和青年都组织起来了。他们纷纷成立了自己的组织，紧密地团结在波兰统一工人党和贝鲁特同志的周围，开始为复兴与建设自己的祖国而奋斗。他们在提前完成了一九四七——一九四九年的三年计划以后，又从一九五○年开始了大规模建设的六年计划。这个计划完成以后，波兰的工业产量将比一九三八年提高四倍多，波兰将因此变成一个工业发达的强盛国家。波兰走向社会主义的经济基础亦将由此奠定。
    在六年计划的前三年里，波兰人民已获得了巨大的成就。展览会里的许多图片都说明了这一点：每年产钢量高达一百一十万吨的“捷斯多科华”钢铁厂开工了；波兰第一个社会主义城市“诺伐·胡塔”冶炼厂的炼钢炉正倾泻着第一炉的钢水，等到这个钢铁中心全部建设完成并开工的时候，它的年产量将超过战前波兰全国的钢铁产量；在华沙近郊新建起来的“热兰”汽车工厂，正在一批批地生产仿照苏联“胜利”牌小汽车式样的客车。
    波兰在工业建设中所获得的巨大成就，也给农业带来了很大的利益。成千成万架农业机器从工厂里源源不绝地开出来，驶往田野，给农庄带来了丰收。到一九五五年的时候，波兰全国的乡村将得到六万一千架拖拉机，这个数字比一九四四年多出五倍。
    当人民用自己勤劳的双手和智慧在生产中不断取得胜利时，他们的生活也就一天比一天幸福起来了。现在波兰的国家预算，有三分之一是用于文教建设事业的。人民民主政权为广大的儿童与青年开辟了无限美好的前途。现在波兰十四岁以下的儿童都要受义务教育，学校已为工人和劳动农民的子女打开了大门。在一九五二年，波兰全国各大学的新生有百分之七十是工农子弟，全国参加各种学习的有六百万人，连五、六十岁的老年男女也在孜孜不倦地学习着。
    波兰是一个有着光辉灿烂的文化传统的民族，它曾为人类的文明贡献出了哥白尼、居里夫人、萧邦等这些伟大的科学家和艺术家。波兰人民特别珍爱这种光荣的文化传统。人们可以从图片中看到，伟大的爱国者、音乐家萧邦的作品正在被广泛演奏，历史的文物受到了保护和珍视，剧院里在上演着著名的古典剧，雕刻家在精心制作着自己的作品，青年男女们在选购他们心爱的书籍……。
    在另外几幅图片上，三三两两的工人正在扯起游艇的风帆，准备作假日的郊游；许多工人正在享受免费的治疗；托儿所里的娃娃们正在欢乐地歌舞。在图片中，贝鲁特同志的一句话特别引人注意：
    “替人安排一个简单舒适的家庭，创造一个更美满的生活，更幸福的前途，这是我们神圣的责任。”这句话，充分地表现了波兰统一工人党和波兰人民领袖对于波兰人民的无限关怀。
    展览会以很大一部分图片表现了中波两国人民的友谊。人们首先看到的是一幅“五一”节游行的照片——群众在游行时高举着的各国人民领袖像中，有着被波兰人民所敬爱的毛泽东主席的巨像。三年来，中波两国人民在经济上与文化上的关系是一天比一天密切了。我们看到装载着波兰工业产品的“和平”号商轮正在启碇开来我国，波兰留华学生在专心地学习着中文，中国留波学生在晚会上和波兰朋友们手拉手地亲密歌舞。还有一幅色彩鲜明的图片表明，一九五一年中波两国的贸易量已比战前增加了二十多倍了。
    在展览会的两个高玻璃柜里，还陈列着许多波兰人民的民族服装、日常用品和书籍，其中还有毛主席著的“中国革命战争的战略问题”的波兰文译本，著名的波兰作家和记者所写的“新中国的诞生”、“在新中国”、“新中国印象记”等书籍，它们说明了波兰人民对中国人民的斗争和生活的关怀。
    “正在建设社会主义社会的波兰”展览会，向观众们清楚地介绍了波兰在建设中所获得的巨大成就和它走向社会主义社会的远景。这个展览会将使我国人民进一步认识这个远在波罗的海海岸的兄弟国家，从而增进中波两国人民的了解和友谊。（附图片）
