The representatives emphatically pointed out that the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference were manifested in: exposing the true colors of the enemies of peace, giving full play to the spirit of democratic consultation, putting forward the urgent tasks of the peace movement in the region, and enhancing international solidarity in the cause of peace. This has made a great contribution to mobilizing the people of Asia and the Pacific region and the people of the world to carry out the cause of defending peace. The representatives called on people from all walks of life to regard resolutely supporting and implementing the resolutions of the peace conference as their glorious duty and responsibility, and to implement the spirit of the resolutions into their practical actions in production, study, work, and resisting America and aiding Korea.

The representatives' reports were warmly welcomed by the people of all walks of life in various places, greatly boosting the confidence of the people of all walks of life in the country's upcoming large-scale economic construction and defense of peace. Various places are now combining the activities of "China-Soviet Friendship Month" to carry out propaganda for the defense of peace.
