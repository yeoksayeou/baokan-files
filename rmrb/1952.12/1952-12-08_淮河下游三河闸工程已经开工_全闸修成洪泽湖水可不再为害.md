The Sanhe Sluice project, designed to control Hongze Lake and a major undertaking in the third year of Huai River harnessing, is now underway on the lower reaches of the Huai River. The Sanhe Sluice is another massive sluice gate in China's water conservancy construction, following the Jinjiang Flood Diversion Project's diversion gate and the Runheji diversion sluice. Its scale is second only to the Jinjiang Flood Diversion Project's diversion gate. Due to the experience gained by the Huai River harnessing project's technical personnel and the vast number of workers and laborers over the past two years, construction efficiency is very high after the project started. From early October to the present, the earthwork for the Sanhe Sluice's foundation has been completed, and concrete pouring is now beginning. According to the current project progress, the entire sluice is expected to be completed before the flood season next year.

The Sanhe Sluice is located at Sanhekou, where Hongze Lake and the Sanhe River connect, to effectively control Hongze Lake and prevent the lake water from overflowing uncontrollably. From then on, the people of northern Jiangsu, who have long been threatened by floods from Hongze Lake, will not only be spared from disasters but will also be able to use the lake water to irrigate farmland and develop shipping. The Sanhe Sluice's body is nearly seven hundred meters long and has a total of sixty-three openings. The entire sluice's planning and design have incorporated advanced Soviet experience and the construction experience of other sluices. Following the Soviet experience of not using foundation piles for sluice construction, the sluice's abutment walls and upstream wing walls are constructed using concrete box culverts. Furthermore, "inverted filters" and "stilling basins" have been installed upstream and downstream of the sluice, which greatly shortens the construction period and ensures the safety of the sluice body. The designed Sanhe Sluice gates are operated by electric switches. One person controls the button, and sixty-three steel gates can be opened automatically. The sluice also has a highway bridge and a working bridge (for operating the gates) to facilitate frequent transportation. In addition, a seven-li-long (3.5 km) earthen dam to enclose Sanhekou, a three hundred-meter-long barrage dam, and a diversion canal involving over four million cubic meters of earthwork must be built. Therefore, the construction time is extremely tight.

As early as August of this year, the Huai River Harnessing Committee had been working intensely to prepare for the construction of the Sanhe Sluice. The total amount of materials needed for the project, such as cement, yellow sand, gravel, and machinery, is as much as 300,000 tons, and it is quite difficult to transport them to the construction site from all over the country in a short period. The waterway from Xuyi to Sanhe, which is sixty-eight li (34 km) long, is full of reefs, and few people dared to take this route in the past. However, waterway workers worked day and night and finally opened a new shipping route. Employees of state-owned shipping companies actively promoted the Soviet "single-line towing method," which greatly improved transportation efficiency, enabling all the materials needed for the project to be delivered to the construction site in a timely manner and ensuring that the project was carried out according to plan.

Most of the workers participating in the construction of the Sanhe Sluice had participated in the Jinjiang Flood Diversion Project and the Runheji Diversion Sluice project. They enthusiastically and diligently brought their set of skilled working techniques to the Sanhe Sluice construction site. For example, the workers in the steel bar team adopted the assembly line method, which made the steel bar binding technology increasingly skilled. The working efficiency generally increased from bending more than a dozen steel bars per day to fifty or eighty, and individual work groups increased to bending one hundred and forty steel bars per day. The workers in the cement team learned from advanced Soviet operating methods and, after improving organization and scientific division of labor, greatly shortened the working hours for pouring the sluice bottom plate. More than 50,000 laborers from Gaoyou, Huaiyin, Jiangdu, Siyang and other counties were also in high spirits. They volunteered to travel five hundred li (250 km) to the construction site. The working efficiency of the laborers in the earth excavation is also constantly increasing. Although the distance for soil excavation by the laborers of the Jiangdu Brigade has increased from 600 meters to 1,600 meters, the excavation efficiency has increased relatively. The laborers on the entire construction site dug the more than 70,000 cubic meters of soil for the sluice foundation in just over a month, and they are now stepping up the excavation of the downstream "stilling basin" and the Sanhe Sluice's upper and lower diversion canals.

### 淮河下游三河闸工程已经开工  全闸修成洪泽湖水可不再为害

    淮河下游三河闸工程已经开工
    全闸修成洪泽湖水可不再为害
    第三年度治淮工程中要在淮河下游大力兴修的控制洪泽湖的三河闸工程，现在已经开工。三河闸工程是继荆江分洪工程的进洪闸及润河集分水闸兴建之后，在我国水利建设中的又一个巨大水闸，其规模仅次于荆江分洪工程中的进洪闸。由于治淮工程技术人员和广大工人、民工两年来已经有了不少经验，所以这期工程开工后，施工效率很高。自十月初到目前，三河闸的闸基土方工程已经完成，正开始浇灌混凝土。按现在的工程进度，预计全闸明年汛期前可以完成。
    三河闸设置在洪泽湖和三河相接的三河口，为的是有效地控制洪泽湖，使湖水不再无节制地漫流。从此，长期受洪泽湖洪水威胁的苏北人民不但可以免除灾害，而且还能利用湖水灌溉农田和发展航运。三河闸闸身长近七百公尺，共六十三孔。全闸的规划设计都是吸取苏联的先进经验和其他水闸的建筑经验进行的。按照苏联建闸不打基桩的经验，闸的岸墙和闸的上游翼墙都是采用混凝土空箱式的；并且在闸的上、下游设置了“倒滤器”和“消力塘”，这就大大缩短了施工期限并保障了闸身的安全。设计的三河闸闸门是用电力开关的。一个人控制电纽，六十三扇钢质闸门便可自动开启。水闸上面还设有公路桥与工作桥（操纵闸门用的），以便供频繁的运输之用。此外，还要筑一条封闭三河口的七华里长的草坝和一条三百多公尺长的拦河坝，以及开挖一条有四百多万土方的引河。所以，施工时间异常紧迫。
    治淮委员会早在今年八月间，就紧张地作了修建三河闸的各项准备工作。工程所需的全部器材如水泥、黄砂、石子、机器等足有三十万吨，要在短期内从全国各地运到工地，存有不少困难。从盱眙到三河的水路，长达六十八里，布满了暗礁，过去很少有人敢走这条路。但水运工人日夜努力，终于打开了水上的新航线。国营轮船公司职工更积极推广苏联“一列式拖带法”，大大提高了运输效率。使全部工程所需的器材及时运到工地，保证了工程按计划施工。
    参加修建三河闸的工人，大部分是参加过荆江分洪工程和润河集分水闸工程的，他们的一套熟练的工作技术，都热情、紧张地带到了三河闸工地。如钢筋大队工人采用了流水作业法，使扎钢筋的技术日趋熟练，工作效率一般从每日弯十多根钢筋增加到五十根、八十根，个别工作组增加到每日弯一百四十根。洋灰大队工人吸取苏联先进操作法，改善组织、科学分工后，使灌浇闸底板的工时大大缩短。高邮、淮阴、江都、泗阳等县五万多民工情绪也十分高涨，他们自动报名跋涉五百里走上工地。民工们在挖土方中工作效率也在不断上升。江都总队民工挖土距离虽然从六百公尺增加到一千六百公尺，但挖土效率还是相对增加。全工地的民工只用了一个多月的时间便把七万多土方的闸基挖好了，现在正加紧挖下游的“消力塘”和三河闸上下引河。（新华社）
