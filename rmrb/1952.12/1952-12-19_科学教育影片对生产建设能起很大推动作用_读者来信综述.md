    Scientific Education Films Can Greatly Promote Production and Construction
    -- Summary of Readers' Letters

    Recently, we received some letters from readers discussing how scientific education films can greatly promote production and construction. They hope that filmmakers and scientists, as well as advanced producers, can cooperate to produce more of these films in the future to popularize scientific knowledge, promote advanced experiences, and improve the cultural and scientific level of the masses. Xin Ge from Zibo, Shandong, wrote: Shi Xiangheng and Zhang Qingshun, electric welders at the Shandong Xinbo Coal Mine Repair Factory, watched the Soviet film "The Light of Life," which showed Soviet female welders using the two-handed operation method and winning in the production competition. Shi Xiangheng and Zhang Qingshun then learned to use the two-handed welding method for their work. As a result, work that previously took four hours to complete was finished in two hours. Recently, they came up with another idea: holding the welding rod in the right hand and a five-centimeter thick iron wire in the left hand, using the iron wire instead of the welding rod. This not only saved welding rod materials but also improved production quality, greatly reducing the occurrence of small pits. After using the two-handed operation method, they can save the country more than 200,000 yuan a day. Xin Ge said: "This is just a small example of the role that scientific education films play in popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting advanced experiences. If a large number of films in this area are produced, there will certainly be greater gains in promoting production."
    Xie Qisui from the Sixth Automobile School in Datong, Shanxi, wrote that in an interview report, he read the speech by Fedorov, the head of the Soviet film art workers delegation, about Soviet films. The speech mentioned that Soviet science popularization films have achieved great success in promoting advanced scientific knowledge, exchanging people's production technology experience, and teaching specialized professions. For example, films teaching how to drive cars, trains, and tractors have enabled many people to learn and master these technologies from the films. Xie Qisui said that many people in their automobile school try their best to teach students how to drive cars, but it requires a considerable period of technical education and a lot of gasoline to learn. How wonderful it would be if there was a film teaching how to drive a car. Therefore, he hopes that on the one hand, more Soviet scientific education films will be translated to promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, our filmmakers and scientific and technical personnel should also cooperate and work hard to produce films that teach technology, introduce advanced production experience, and important inventions, so that more people can quickly learn advanced production technology, which can play a significant role in our country's large-scale economic construction.
    Kang Min, a reader from Beijing, wrote that he recently watched two educational films and cartoons about the patriotic health campaign. They vividly used real images to promote common knowledge about bacteria and summer health care, giving people a solid and popular hygiene lesson. He believes that film, the most popular and powerful weapon, can be used in all aspects of propaganda work. For example, short films can be made about the origin of mankind, rapid literacy methods, and the introduction of advanced Soviet science, and shown widely.

    科学教育影片对生产建设能起很大推动作用
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们收到一些读者来信，谈到科学教育影片对生产建设能起很大推动作用，希望电影工作者和科学工作者、先进生产者合作，今后多拍摄这类影片，以普及科学知识、推广先进经验、提高群众的文化科学水平。山东淄博辛歌来信说：山东新博煤矿修理厂电焊工人史向恒、张清顺，看了苏联影片“生活的光芒”中苏联电焊女工运用双手操作法烧焊，在生产竞赛运动中获得了胜利，史向恒和张清顺便学习用双手电焊法工作，结果需用四个钟头才能做完的工作，两个钟头就完成了。最近他们又想出：右手拿焊条，左手拿根五糎粗的铁丝，用铁丝代替了焊条，不但节约了焊条原料，还提高了生产质量，出小窝子的毛病大大减少了。他们运用双手操作法后，一天可以给国家节省二十多万元。辛歌说：“这只是科学教育片对普及科学知识、推广先进经验所起作用的一个小例子，如果大量地拍制这方面的影片，在推动生产上一定能有更大的收获。”
    山西大同第六汽车学校谢启燧来信说，他在访问记中看到苏联电影艺术工作者代表团的团长费道罗夫关于苏联电影的谈话，其中提到苏联科学普及影片，在推广先进的科学知识、交流人民生产技术经验，以及教授专门职业等方面有很大成就。如教授开汽车、开火车、开拖拉机的影片，使很多人从影片里学会掌握这些技术。谢启燧说，他们汽车学校许多人想尽办法来教会学员开汽车，但必须经过相当长的技术教育，花费很多的汽油才能学会，如果有一部教授开汽车的影片那该多么好。因此，他希望一方面多翻译苏联的科学教育片，推广苏联的先进经验，一方面我们的电影工作者和科学、技术人员等，也应多在这方面合作、努力，拍制技术传授、介绍先进生产经验和重要的创造发明的影片，使更多的人更快地学会先进的生产技术，对我国大规模的经济建设能起很大作用。
    北京读者康敏来信说，他最近看了两部关于爱国卫生运动的教育片和动画片，它们生动地以真实的形象宣传了关于细菌和夏季保健的常识等，它给人们扎实地上了一堂通俗的卫生课。他认为可以把电影这个最大众化的有力武器，使用在宣传工作的一切方面。如关于人类起源、速成识字法、先进的苏联科学的介绍等等，都可以制成短片，广泛放映。
