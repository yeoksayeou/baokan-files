Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 28th. At the liaison officers meeting held on December 28th by the U.S. delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. liaison officer admitted that U.S. military aircraft did intrude into the airspace over the conference area on November 15th, and admitted that the U.S. side shelled the conference area on December 20th, expressing regret for these two violations of the agreement. At the same time, the U.S. liaison officer flatly denied the incident of U.S. military aircraft flying over the conference area on December 18th and the incident of the U.S. distributing slanderous leaflets in the conference area on the same day. Our liaison officer pointed out that the facts cannot be denied, and the U.S. side cannot evade its responsibility for violating the agreement.

    朝鲜谈判双方联络官会上
    美方承认两项违反协议事件
    【新华社开城二十八日电】朝鲜停战谈判美方代表团联络官在十二月二十八日的双方联络官会上，承认美方军用飞机确曾在十一月十五日侵入会场区上空，并承认美方曾在十二月二十日炮击会场区，对这两项违反协议的事件表示遗憾。但同时美方联络官矢口抵赖十二月十八日美方军用飞机飞越会场区的事件和同日美方在会场区内散发诬蔑性的传单的事件。我方联络官指出，事实不容抵赖，美方不能推卸其违反协议的责任。
