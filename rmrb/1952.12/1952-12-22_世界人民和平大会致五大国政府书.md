    The necessity of abandoning the use of force as a means of resolving international conflicts is becoming more urgent every day.
    Six hundred million men and women around the world have signed, in a spirit of full responsibility, demanding that the Five Great Powers hold consultations to conclude a peace pact.
    Representatives of important sections of public opinion have also expressed their desire to abandon the policy of force and adopt the method of consultation. The World People's Peace Congress, convened in Vienna on December 12, 1952, expressing the will of mankind, solemnly requests that the governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Peoples Republic of China, Great Britain, and France hold consultations to decide the fate of peace.
    An agreement between the Five Great Powers and the conclusion of a peace pact would eliminate international tensions and save the world from catastrophe. This is the demand of the people of the world.

    世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书
    必须放弃把武力当作解决国际冲突的手段，这一点是一天天更加迫切了。
    全世界已有六亿男女本着充分负责的精神签了名，要求五大国举行协商缔结和平公约。
    舆论界重要部分的代表们也已表示了他们的愿望，希望放弃武力政策而采取协商的办法。一九五二年十二月十二日在维也纳召集的世界人民和平大会，表达人类的意志，郑重要求美利坚合众国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、中华人民共和国、大不列颠和法国的政府举行决定和平命运的协商。
    五大国取得协议、缔结和平公约，就将消除国际紧张形势，拯救世界免于浩劫。这是全世界人民的要求。
