    Benxi Iron and Steel Plant Continuously Sets New Records in Medium-Sized Blast Furnace Ironmaking
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] The Benxi Coal and Iron Company's Ironmaking Plant, a state-owned enterprise, set two new records in medium-sized blast furnace ironmaking during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The furnace volume required to produce one ton of iron was reduced to 0.638 in a certain blast furnace on November 12th, and another blast furnace created a new record of 0.613 on November 19th. In the first half of November, the average for all blast furnaces in the plant had dropped to 0.67. The ratio of iron ore to coke averaged over 1.9, and reached a maximum of 2.155.
    The Benxi Coal and Iron Company's Ironmaking Plant was able to achieve the above results mainly due to the implementation of the advanced operating methods suggested by Soviet experts, namely high blast temperature, full air volume, and heavy burden with fast descent, and also by adopting measures such as producing acidic slag and using self-fluxing sintered ore to reduce heat consumption within the furnace. At present, all plant employees are enthusiastically launching a production competition campaign to strive to complete the annual production increase and savings tasks three days ahead of the original plan.

    本溪炼铁厂连创中型高炉炼铁新纪录
    【新华社二十九日讯】国营本溪煤铁公司炼铁厂在“中苏友好月”中连创两次中型高炉炼铁的新纪录。炼出一吨铁所需要的炉容积，十一月十二日某高炉已降至零点六三八，十九日另一高炉更创造出零点六一三的新纪录。十一月上半月全厂高炉平均已降到零点六七。铁矿石和焦炭的比例平均已达一点九以上，最高曾达二点一五五。
    本溪煤铁公司炼铁厂能获得上述成绩，主要是由于推行了苏联专家建议的高风温、全风量、重料快行的先进操作方法，并且采取了出酸性渣、使用自熔性烧结矿以减少炉内热量消耗等办法。目前全厂职工更热烈地展开了生产竞赛运动，争取按原计划提前三天完成全年增产节约任务。
