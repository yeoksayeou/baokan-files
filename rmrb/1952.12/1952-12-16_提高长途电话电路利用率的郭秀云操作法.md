Guo Xiuyun, a model worker, is a long-distance telephone operator at the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau. She is twenty-two years old this year. Under the education of the Party, she has diligently studied technology, broken old operating habits, and created a complete set of advanced operating methods.

The advantage of Guo Xiuyun's operation method is that it can greatly shorten the time operators spend occupying the line when handling long-distance calls, increase the direct talk time for users, and thus greatly improve the effective utilization rate of long-distance telephone circuits. When handling four circuits, Guo Xiuyun used her own created operating method to connect each telephone call with an average processing time of 81.18 seconds, while the national average for excellent operators is 236.77 seconds. When handling three circuits, the average processing time for connecting each telephone call was 58.8 seconds, while the average for general excellent operators was 193.26 seconds. These new records of Guo Xiuyun have approached the technical level of outstanding Soviet operators. The hourly production quota for Soviet operators handling three circuits is 47 talking minutes [note]. Guo Xiuyun has reached 52.128 talking minutes, and is only two minutes behind the achievement of Soviet first-class excellent operator Ivanova, who has 55 talking minutes per hour.

According to preliminary calculations, if Guo Xiuyun's operation method is promoted nationwide, it can increase the effective utilization rate of national long-distance telephone circuits by more than 22%, and save the country 387.3 billion yuan in long-distance telephone line infrastructure construction funds. This will enable the people's postal and telecommunications enterprises to serve national defense, political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings more effectively and promptly.

Guo Xiuyun's operation method has four basic characteristics:

The first characteristic is to implement a pre-reporting and pre-occupation system, actively arranging her work to ensure smooth communication for users.

When using the old operating methods, it was common to use direct reporting and direct connection methods. Calling users was done while occupying the circuit during connection. As a result, the sending and receiving users often could not be prepared at the same time, causing one user to wait a long time with the phone. Sometimes, the phone calls were often "moved back" due to the inability to reach the user in time. This wasted the circuit and affected the rapid connection of long-distance calls, causing inconvenience to users. However, Guo Xiuyun often implements a pre-reporting and pre-occupation system when connecting calls. When connecting one phone call, she would pre-notify the other telecommunications bureau of the next or several calls, so that the other operator could timely prepare the receiving user. When the other operator pre-reports to her, she promptly pre-occupies the receiving user. Therefore, after the circuit is connected, the user can pick up the phone and communicate smoothly, avoiding the waste of circuits caused by searching for the user.

The second characteristic is to closely cooperate with the other party to make the work closely connected. To do a good job in long-distance telephone connection, it must depend on the joint efforts of both operators. Therefore, the close cooperation between the two operators in the process of handling each telephone call is one of the important links in the rapid connection of long-distance telephones. In the past, when using the old operating methods, due to the "outbound-oriented" departmentalism, the close connection between the two parties' work was not valued. For example: if the next telephone call was not an outbound call for oneself, one would often neglect timely communication after the call was completed. When the outbound call was completed, one often did not pay attention to making contact with the other party as soon as possible. This caused a large amount of circuit wastage. But Guo Xiuyun is completely opposite. In her operation, she fully embodies the working class's overall concept and collectivist spirit. Regardless of handling incoming, outgoing, or transferred calls, as soon as the user finishes speaking, she takes the initiative to contact the other party first, quickly connects the next telephone call, and then handles the unfinished work of the next telephone call. Under any circumstances, she does not relax her close cooperation with the other operator, so that the work of both parties remains closely connected. This not only eliminates the circuit wastage caused by untimely communication, but also ensures that long-distance telephone calls are quickly connected one after another.

The third characteristic is to conduct cross-actions in an organized and regular manner. Because operators often handle more than three circuits at the same time, in the work of connecting telephone calls, operators often need to perform several single actions simultaneously. Therefore, frequently and rationally organizing cross-actions has become an important condition for improving circuit utilization. In the process of long-distance telephone connection, Guo Xiuyun often organizes cross-actions regularly according to specific circumstances. Therefore, she can not only perform several single actions simultaneously on one circuit, but also perform operations on two circuits at the same time. This can minimize the occupation time of some necessary actions in the process of handling telephone calls, so that some actions that do not necessarily occupy the circuit can be done without occupying the circuit.

The fourth characteristic is to listen frequently and repeatedly with the shortest time and the fastest actions. Guo Xiuyun-style listening is the central link in improving circuit utilization. In the past, listening was mainly for recording the time and number of outbound calls. However, Guo Xiuyun-style listening mainly uses the user's tone to grasp the progress of the user's call. Therefore, she can not only accurately record the time and number of outbound calls, and timely discover the poor quality and volume situations, but also greatly shorten the processing time of operators occupying the circuit and overcome various circuit wastage phenomena. When Guo Xiuyun takes over each shift, the first action is to listen to all circuits universally, first to have a clear understanding in her mind. She said: "As long as you listen well, you can do other work with confidence." This is the conclusion of how important the listening work is to the entire operation.

[Note] Talking minutes refer to the time the user is talking. Forty-seven talking minutes means that in sixty minutes, forty-seven minutes are the user's talking time, and the remaining thirteen minutes are the time occupied by the operator in the operation. (Attached picture)

    提高长途电话电路利用率的郭秀云操作法
    劳动模范郭秀云是天津电信局长途台话务员，今年二十二岁。她在党的教育下，努力钻研技术，打破了陈旧的操作习惯，创造出一套完整的先进操作法。
    郭秀云操作法的优点是可以大量缩短话务员处理长途电话时占用线路的时间，增加用户直接通话的时间，因而大大提高了长途电话电路的有效利用率。在掌握四条电路时，郭秀云运用自己创造的操作法，接通每个电话的处理时间平均为八十一点一八秒，而全国一般优秀话务员是二百三十六点七七秒；在掌握三条电路时，接通每个电话的处理时间平均为五十八点八秒，而一般优秀话务员是一百九十三点二六秒。郭秀云的这些新纪录已接近了苏联优秀话务员的技术水平。苏联掌握三条电路的话务员的每小时的生产定额是四十七通话分钟〔注〕，郭秀云已达到五十二点一二八通话分钟，和苏联一级优秀话务员伊凡诺娃每小时五十五通话分钟的成绩相比，仅差两分多钟。
    根据初步计算，郭秀云操作法如在全国推广，可以使全国长途电话的电路有效利用率提高百分之二十二以上，可以为国家节省三千八百七十三亿元的长途电话线路的基本建设资金。使人民邮电企业能更有效、更及时地为国防、政治、经济、文化建设事业服务。
        郭秀云操作法有四个基本特点：
    第一个特点是实行预报、预占制，主动地安排自己的工作，以保证用户顺利通话。
    在运用旧的操作方法时，一般都采用直报、直接的办法来接线。呼叫用户的工作，都是临接线时，占着电路来进行的。因之发、受方用户往往不能同时准备好，使一方用户拿着话机久等对方。有时还常常因一时叫不到用户而使电话“移后”。结果浪费了电路，而且影响了长途电话的迅速接通，使用户感到不便。郭秀云同志在接线时，却经常实行预报、预占制。当她在接通一个电话时，就把下一个电话或几个电话，预先通知对方的电信局，使对方话务员能及时作好准备受话用户的工作，当对方话务员向她预报后，她就适时地预占受话用户，因之在接通线路后，用户拿起话机，就能顺利通话，避免了因寻找用户而造成的浪费电路的现象。
    第二个特点是密切配合对方，使工作紧密衔接。要搞好长途电话的接续工作，必须取决于双方话务员的共同努力。因此，在处理每个电话的过程中，双方话务员相互间的密切配合，乃是长途电话迅速接通的重要环节之一。在过去运用旧的操作方法时，由于有着“以去话为主”的本位主义思想，很不重视双方工作上的紧密衔接。例如：下一个电话不是自己的去话，就常常忽视通话完毕后的及时联络。在去话完毕的时候，也往往不注意尽先和对方取得联络。这样就造成了大量浪费电路的恶果。但郭秀云同志完全相反，她在操作中，充分体现了工人阶级的整体观念和集体主义精神，不论处理来话、去话或转话，只要一到用户话毕，就首先主动找对方联络，尽快地把下一个电话接通，然后处理下一个电话话毕未了的工作。她在任何情况之下，都不放松与对方话务员的密切配合，使双方工作保持紧密的衔接，这不但能消灭因不及时联络而造成的电路浪费现象，而且保证了长途电话一个紧跟着一个地迅速接通。
    第三个特点是有组织、有规律地进行交叉动作。由于话务员在操作的时候，经常掌握三条以上的电路，在接续电话的工作中，常常需要话务员同时进行几个单项动作。因此，经常合理地组织交叉动作，就成为提高电路利用率的一个重要条件。郭秀云同志在长途电话的接续过程中，经常根据具体情况，有规律地组织交叉动作，因此，她不仅能在一条电线上同时进行几个单项动作，并且能同时在两条电路上进行操作。这样就能尽量缩短处理电话过程中的一些必须占用电路的动作时间，使一些不必须占用电路的动作，都能不占用电路。
    第四个特点是用最短的时间和最快的动作，经常地反复地监听。郭秀云式的监听，是提高电路利用率的中心环节。在过去，监听主要是为了记录去话的时间和次数。但郭秀云式的监听，主要是通过用户讲话的语气，来掌握用户通话的进展状况。因此，他不仅能准确地记录去话的时间和次数，及时地发现音质、音量的不良情况，而且能大量缩短话务员占用电路的处理时间，克服各种浪费电路的现象。郭秀云同志在每次接班的时候，第一个动作就是对各条电路进行普遍的监听，首先作到心中有数。她说：“只要监听得好，就可以放心大胆地做其他工作。”这就是监听工作对整个操作具有如何重大意义的结论。
    〔注〕通话分钟是指用户通话的时间。四十七通话分钟，是指在六十分钟内，有四十七分钟是用户通话的时间，而其余的十三分钟是话务员在操作时占用的时间。（附图片）
