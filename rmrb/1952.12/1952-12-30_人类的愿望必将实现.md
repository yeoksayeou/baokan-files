    Humanity's Aspirations Will Surely Be Realized
    Stalin International Peace Prize Winner,
    Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, Saifu Ding Keqi Lu
    A conference of the same scale as this World People's Peace Congress is unprecedented in human history. People with different views gathered together to discuss the urgent problems facing humanity. They not only discussed, but also unanimously agreed on solutions to these problems. This deeply moved us.
    I believe that the two documents passed by the Congress and the reports of the three subcommittees are historic decisions and will be universally welcomed by people all over the world.
    The "World People's Peace Congress Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers" presents us with the current practical work. I am honored to participate in the committee appointed by the Congress to prepare and deliver this document to the governments of the five great powers. Humanity will pay close attention to the results of our efforts. If we can get the five great powers to negotiate and conclude a peace treaty, we will turn the world from the road of war to the road of peace.
    As an Indian, I am very pleased that the Congress has paid attention to the issue of national independence and international security. The decisions we have made in this regard, and the report of the subcommittee on this issue, have strengthened the strength and confidence of the colonial people and all the people in their struggle for freedom and to defend their sovereignty.
    I am also very pleased that the Indian delegation was able to unanimously agree on those proposals that could serve as the basis for resolving the Korean issue. The fact that our delegation, composed of representatives of different political parties, was able to take a common stand with the Chinese delegation greatly helped the Congress to reach consensus on this important issue. We firmly stated at the Congress that Asians will never fight Asians, and that we millions of Asians must stand together and unite with all the people of the world to fight for peace.
    I believe that a new vision is emerging today for the peace movements in various countries. The resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress open the door to those who stand outside the peace movement, allowing them to join our ranks; at the same time, they enable those who may still be unwilling to join our ranks to cooperate with us for a common cause.
    The Vienna Congress is an excellent proof that people with opposing views can reach agreement on peace issues.
    When our delegation returns to India, we will do our best to publicize the resolutions of the Vienna Congress, and on this basis develop India's peace movement into a broad mass movement.

    人类的愿望必将实现
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人
     全印和平理事会主席  赛福丁·克其鲁
    和这次世界人民和平大会同样规模的会议，是人类历史上从来没有过的。具有不同观点的人们聚集一堂，讨论人类所面对的迫切问题。他们不仅讨论，而且一致同意对这些问题的解决办法。这深深地感动了我们。
    我相信大会所通过的两个文件和三个小组委员会的报告，是历史性的决定，并将受到世界各地人民的普遍欢迎。
    “世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书”向我们提出了当前的实际工作。我很荣幸地参加了大会所指派的委员会，准备把这个文件送交五大国政府。人类将关心地注视我们努力的结果。如果我们能使五大国协商缔结和平公约，我们就把世界从战争道路上扭转到和平道路上去了。
    作为一个印度人，我很高兴民族独立与国际安全问题受到大会的重视。我们在这方面所作的决定，和小组委员会对这个问题的报告，使殖民地人民和所有的人民在他们争取自由和保卫主权的斗争中，增强了力量和信心。
    我也很高兴印度代表团能一致同意那些可以作为解决朝鲜问题的基础的提议。我们这个由不同政党的代表所组成的代表团，能够和中国代表团采取共同的立场，这对大会在这个重要问题上取得一致有很大帮助。我们在大会上坚决表明，亚洲人永远不打亚洲人，我们亚洲千百万人民要站在一起，并和全世界所有的人民联合起来，为和平而奋斗。
    我相信今天在各国的和平运动面前呈现着新的远景。世界人民和平大会的决议，向那些站在和平运动之外的人们洞开着大门，使他们参加到我们的队伍中来；同时使那些可能仍然不愿参加我们的队伍的人们，也为了共同事业与我们合作。
    维也纳大会是一个绝好的证明，观点相反的人们是可以在和平问题上取得一致的。
    当我们的代表团回到印度时，我们将尽我们的能力来宣传维也纳大会的决议，并在这个基础上把印度的和平运动发展成为广泛的群众性运动。
