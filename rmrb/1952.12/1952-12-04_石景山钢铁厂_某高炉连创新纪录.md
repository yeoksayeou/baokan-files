　　A Blast Furnace Continuously Sets New Records
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," workers at a certain blast furnace in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant intensified their study of advanced Soviet experiences and created three new records within ten days. The first time was on November 6th, with production exceeding the quota by 23 percent; the second time was on the 14th, exceeding the quota by 27 percent; and the third time was on the 16th, exceeding the quota by 32 percent, effectively reducing the volume utilization coefficient to 0.72. This is mainly due to changes in the proportion of ingredients and the order of charging, which facilitated the smooth flow of materials in the furnace and increased the number of charging batches. At the same time, the number of tapping and slag removal operations was increased, facilitating ventilation and eliminating the previous phenomenon of incomplete iron tapping. The furnace workers stated that they will thoroughly implement the blast furnace technical management regulations formulated by Soviet experts, strengthen their mastery of the furnace, and more humbly learn from the Soviet experience of "fast material flow" to create newer records and complete the annual production increase tasks.

　　石景山钢铁厂
　　某高炉连创新纪录
    石景山钢铁厂某号高炉工人在“中苏友好月”中，加紧学习苏联先进经验，十天内创造三次新纪录。第一次在十一月六日，产量超过定额百分之二十三，第二次在十四日，超过定额百分之二十七，第三次在十六日，超过定额百分之三十二，有效容积利用系数降低到零点七二。这主要是由于改变了配料比例，和装料次序，使炉内下料顺利，下料批数增加。同时，增加了出铁次数和放渣次数，使通风顺利，改变了过去铁出不完的现象。该炉职工表示彻底实行苏联专家制订的高炉技术管理规程，加强了对炉子的掌握；并更虚心学习苏联“快料顺行”的经验，创造更新的纪录，来完成全年的增产任务。
