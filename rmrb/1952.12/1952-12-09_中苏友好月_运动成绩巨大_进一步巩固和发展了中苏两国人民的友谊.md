Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement, launched nationwide over the past month, has achieved brilliant results. This movement has further developed and consolidated the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, enhanced the enthusiasm of the people throughout the country for learning from the Soviet Union, and strengthened their confidence in building the motherland.

From November 7th to December 6th, on the vast land of the motherland, from the warm Hainan Island to the snow-covered Inner Mongolia, from the towering mountains of the Kangzang Plateau to the undulating islands of the East China Sea, everywhere was filled with a joyful festive atmosphere. Mass rallies were generally held in various places, and tens of thousands of propaganda personnel were dispatched. Various forms of propaganda that the masses loved to see and hear, such as courtyard meetings, street plays, propaganda sheds, cultural stations, rooftop broadcasts, picture exhibitions, film screenings, and seminars and reports, were adopted to vigorously carry out publicity to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship. In Hebei and Jiangsu provinces alone, more than 900,000 propaganda personnel were organized to go deep into the countryside to carry out work. According to incomplete statistics, in the 67 cities across the country that held Soviet film exhibitions, more than 40 million people watched Soviet films. In Shanghai, which has a population of more than 5.4 million, the audience for Soviet films reached 5.9 million. Wuhan held more than 1,400 seminars and report meetings, with more than 540,000 participants. People of all nationalities, strata, occupations, and religious beliefs across the country enthusiastically participated in Sino-Soviet friendship activities. Yi ethnic farmers in Zhan Yi County, Yunnan Province, organized a national song and dance troupe of more than 4,000 people to promote Sino-Soviet friendship in other counties. Large and small temples in Xi'an held report meetings and seminars; many imams in mosques in Lanzhou explained Sino-Soviet friendship to the Hui people on "Juma Day." Over the past month, publicity about Sino-Soviet friendship has basically achieved "household knowledge" in vast areas. According to preliminary statistics, 40 million people in Henan and western Liaoning have been directly educated about Sino-Soviet friendship and the socialist and communist future, accounting for about 83 percent of the total population of the two provinces; more than 90 percent of urban residents in Northeast China, Hebei, Jiangsu, and other provinces have generally received education; more than 80 percent of residents in Shanghai and Tianjin have received relatively profound education; in Ningxia Province, 60 percent of the population learned about the principles of Sino-Soviet friendship through various activities.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the broad masses of working people conscientiously studied and promoted advanced Soviet experience and advanced science and technology, creating good conditions for the large-scale construction that is about to come. In factories and mines, production has greatly increased due to the active promotion of advanced Soviet experience, and many new records have emerged. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," employees of the steelmaking plant and iron smelting plant of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company created new national records for steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces and iron smelting in large blast furnaces. The steelmaking time and hearth area utilization coefficient far exceeded the output of similar open-hearth furnaces in various capitalist countries. This is a great victory in China's steel industry production. Workers in the steelmaking workshop of the Central China Iron and Steel Company also twice set new national records for steelmaking in small blast furnaces. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in Henan Province promoted the advanced Soviet experience of multi-header well-building cyclic operation and created a new national well-building record of 17.15 meters per day. Employees of the Qiqihar Railway Factory in Northeast China enthusiastically studied advanced Soviet experience and launched a "full-house red" competition. As a result, they overfulfilled the annual production plan in mid-November and increased production and saved more than 138,000 tons of grain for the country. In order to carry out learning in a more organized and systematic way, the trade unions of Dalian, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, and other cities held "Soviet Advanced Work Method Performance Meetings" or held summary meetings, recollection meetings, and seminars to further enhance the enthusiasm of employees to learn from the Soviet Union. After the Jiangnan Shipyard in East China held a high-speed electric welding method performance, 18 factories quickly promoted this advanced work method. The Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, Qiqihar Machinery Factory No. 15, and others also rewarded a large number of workshops, groups, and individuals who had achieved success in learning from advanced Soviet experience during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." In the process of learning from advanced Soviet experience, the broad masses of employees, especially many technicians, have gradually recognized the superiority of Soviet technology and corrected the backward thinking of blindly worshipping European and American technology. Rong Ke, an engineer at the Shanxi State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, had worshipped British and American technology for many years. Now, he has used the learning of advanced Soviet experience to achieve important achievements in cast iron. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," he was elected as the chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the unit. Among the broad masses of farmers and education and medical workers, a wave of learning from advanced Soviet experience has also been set off. In order to welcome the 1953 patriotic bumper harvest competition, farmers conscientiously studied Soviet agricultural science and technology. Zhang Jinzhang Mutual Aid Group in Jinhua County, Zhejiang, carefully studied advanced experience such as deep plowing and close planting when discussing next year's production plan. Educators in various places enthusiastically learned advanced Soviet teaching methods and studied and adopted Soviet textbooks. Teachers in primary and secondary schools in Tianjin generally studied "Pedagogy" written by Soviet education expert Kairov, and many people examined their teaching attitudes and carried out teaching reforms. The national medical community also widely studied Pavlov's theory during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" and further promoted tissue therapy, sleep therapy, and painless childbirth. In order to learn from advanced Soviet experience, a movement to learn Russian has been widely launched among intellectuals in our country.

Another major achievement of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement is that the people of the whole country have generally received education on the socialist and communist future. This is prominently manifested in the fact that the broad masses of farmers have begun to clearly understand the direction of agricultural production development, corrected their erroneous ideas about socialism, and increased their enthusiasm and confidence in organizing themselves and moving towards collectivization. After hearing the report of Chen Shuangtian, a farmer representative who visited the Soviet Union, farmers in Tangxi County, Zhejiang, said: In the past, we thought that socialism meant average public ownership, everyone worked together and ate from the same pot. Now we know that the Soviet Union is paid according to labor, and those who work more get more; plowing, picking cotton, and milking cows are all done with machines, and life will definitely get better and better. We must resolutely follow the path of the Soviet Union! After farmers in Yingxian County, Shanxi, learned about the collectivization and mechanization of Soviet agriculture, 243 farmers in only four districts actively requested to join agricultural production cooperatives, and 635 mutual aid groups reorganized their organizations and formulated production plans. In the past, there was a saying in Pingshun County, Shanxi, that "mountainous areas have no future, they will have to move sooner or later, the soil is thin and there is little cultivated land, and production development has come to an end." Since Li Shunda, a farmer representative who visited the Soviet Union, came with a film team to carry out propaganda, the farmers have dispelled the idea of going down the mountain and are busy planting trees and afforestation. They said: Li Shunda's report on his visit to the Soviet Union is a key to happiness, which has given us a way to develop mountain production. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," many temporary agricultural mutual aid groups in various places were transformed into permanent mutual aid groups, and countless individual farmers applied to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations. People of all other strata have also generally improved their understanding of the Soviet Union during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." After the Beizhan District in Shanghai publicized the participation of Soviet women in social activities and their happy lives to street residents, more than 30 housewives in Yanji Lane who had never gone out of their homes also organized reading groups to study current affairs and expressed their intention to actively participate in various works in the future.

Through various publicity activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the noble communist moral qualities of the Soviet people have more deeply influenced the broad masses of people throughout the country. Zhang Dexiang, an old worker at the Harbin Vehicle Factory, was unwilling to learn advanced experience in the past, and more than 45 percent of his products were defective. Since watching the Soviet film "Donbass Miners," he was deeply moved by the patriotism of the old miner Niedavlien in the film. He began to actively learn advanced work methods, and in a short period of time, he has increased his production efficiency by 70 percent, and the quality has also reached the pass rate. In the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, books such as "An Ordinary Soldier" and "Day and Night" have become the most favorite reading materials for soldiers. Cadres and soldiers have deeply understood the noble qualities and high degree of organization and discipline of the Soviet army from the images of Soviet heroes and increased their enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet army. Many medical workers were very moved after watching the Soviet film "Rural Doctor," and they worked more actively. Jiang Xiurong, a doctor at the Sixth Hygiene Office in Tianjin, said: When I first arrived at the hygiene office, I saw that the equipment was very bad and thought that I had gone to the wrong place. When I saw someone like Qiaomujin in the film, I couldn't help but think of my initial state of uneasiness at work, and I felt ashamed. I am now determined to serve the farmers in the suburbs well. Young students across the country have also launched a more enthusiastic upsurge in learning from outstanding Soviet youths. In bookstores in many cities, books such as "The Story of Zoya and Shura" are sold as much as they are sold. Schools in various places generally hold seminars, literary and art evenings, and story meetings to discuss the heroic deeds of Soviet youth heroes Zoya, Matrosov, and Oleg. Many excellent classes in schools are named after Soviet heroes due to the spirit of learning from the hard work of outstanding Soviet youth. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the Junior Three Class C of Guangzhou Guangya Middle School eliminated the phenomenon that some people failed in their courses in the past, and the average score of all students in the recent exam was 83 points.

The Soviet cultural workers delegation, the Soviet art troupe, the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Soviet film art workers delegation came to our country to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, and met and had parties with the broad masses of people in various places, greatly deepening the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. According to preliminary statistics, over the past month, they have made 37 special reports in various places, participated in 71 seminars, and officially performed 57 times. A total of tens of thousands of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers in our country participated in report meetings and seminars. About 300,000 people from all walks of life watched the performances of Soviet artists, and another organized 20 million people listened to their performances from the radio. The delegations also visited many factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, and cinemas in various places, and held close and pleasant parties with the broad masses of people. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," people from various places also held parties and seminars with Soviet experts who were assisting our country's construction work or invited them to make reports; at the same time, they wrote letters and established contacts with Soviet heroes, models, and working people. The people of Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province alone sent out more than 18,000 letters. This extensive contact has effectively enhanced the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

    “中苏友好月”运动成绩巨大
    进一步巩固和发展了中苏两国人民的友谊
    【新华社八日讯】一个月来在全国范围内展开的“中苏友好月”运动已获得了辉煌成果。这一运动进一步发展和巩固了中苏两国人民的友谊，提高了全国人民学习苏联的热情，增强了建设祖国的信念。
    从十一月七日到十二月六日，在祖国辽阔的土地上，从温暖的海南岛到白雪皑皑的内蒙古，从丛山峻岭的康藏高原，到波浪起伏的东海岛屿，到处充满着欢乐的节日气氛。各地普遍举行了群众性的集会，并出动了数以万计的宣传大军。各地采取院落会、街头剧、宣传棚、文化站、屋顶广播、图片展览、放映影片幻灯和座谈、报告等三十多种群众喜闻乐见的形式，大张旗鼓地展开了加强中苏友好的宣传。仅河北、江苏两省就组织了九十多万宣传人员，深入农村进行工作。据不完全统计，全国六十七个举办苏联影片展览的城市，有四千万人以上观看了苏联影片，拥有五百四十多万人口的上海市，苏联影片的观众达五百九十万人次。武汉市举行了一千四百多次座谈会和报告会，参加人数在五十四万以上。全国各民族、各阶层、各种不同职业和各种不同宗教信仰的人民都热情地投入了中苏友好的活动。云南省霑益县的彝族农民组织了四千多人的民族歌舞团到外县去宣传中苏友好。西安市大小寺院庙宇都举行了报告会、座谈会；兰州市很多清真寺阿訇在“主麻日”向回族人民讲解中苏友谊。一个月来，中苏友好的宣传在广大地区已基本上做到了“家喻户晓”。根据初步统计，河南、辽西就有四千万人直接受到中苏友好和社会主义、共产主义前途的教育，占两省总人口的百分之八十三左右；东北地区和河北、江苏等省的城市居民有百分之九十以上普遍受到教育；上海、天津两市也有百分之八十以上的居民受到比较深刻的教育；在宁夏省，有百分之六十的人口在各种活动中知道了关于中苏友好的道理。
    在“中苏友好月”中，广大劳动人民认真学习和推广苏联先进经验和先进科学技术，为即将来到的大规模建设创设了良好条件，在工厂矿山中，由于积极推广了苏联先进经验，生产大大提高，出现了不少新纪录。国营鞍山钢铁公司的炼钢厂、炼铁厂职工在“中苏友好月”中创造了大型平炉炼钢、大型高炉炼铁的全国新纪录，炼钢时间和炉底面积利用系数远远超过了目前各资本主义国家同样平炉的产量，这是我国钢铁工业生产上的伟大胜利。华中钢铁公司炼钢车间工人也两次创造全国小型高炉炼钢的新纪录。河南焦作矿务局推广苏联多头砌井循环作业的先进经验，创造了日进十七点一五的全国砌井新纪录。东北齐齐哈尔铁路工厂的职工热心学习苏联先进经验，展开了“满堂红”竞赛，结果在十一月中旬就超额完成了全年生产计划，并为国家增产节约十三万八千多吨粮食。为了更有组织、有系统地进行学习，旅大、西安、广州、太原等市的总工会都举办了“苏联先进工作法表演会”，或举行总结会、回忆会和座谈会等，进一步提高了职工们向苏联学习的热情。华东江南造船所举行高速电焊法表演以后，很快就有十八个工厂推行了这一先进工作法。太原市总工会和北京石景山发电厂、大连中苏造船公司、齐齐哈尔机械十五厂等并在“中苏友好月”中奖励了大批学习苏联先进经验有成绩的车间、小组和个人。在学习苏联先进经验中，广大职工特别是许多技术人员已逐渐认识苏联技术上的优越性，纠正了盲目崇拜欧美技术的落后思想。山西国营经纬纺织机械制造厂工程师荣科曾多年崇拜英美技术，现在已用学习苏联先进经验在铸铁方面获得重要成就，在“中苏友好月”，他被选为该单位中苏友好协会的会长。在广大农民和教育、医务工作者中，也掀起了学习苏联先进经验的热潮。农民们为了迎接一九五三年的爱国丰产竞赛，认真学习了苏联的农业科学技术。浙江金华县张金章互助组等在讨论明年增产计划时，仔细研究了深耕、密植等先进经验。各地的教育工作者热心地学习了苏联先进教学法，研究和采用苏联教材。天津市中、小学教师普遍学习苏联教育专家凯罗夫所著“教育学”，很多人检查了教学态度，进行教学改革。全国医务界在“中苏友好月”中也广泛学习巴夫洛夫学说，进一步推广组织疗法睡眠疗法和无痛分娩法。为了要学习苏联先进经验，在我国知识分子中已广泛地掀起了学习俄文的运动。
    “中苏友好月”运动的另一个重大成果，是全国人民普遍受到了社会主义和共产主义前途的教育。这突出地表现在广大农民已开始明确认识农业生产发展的方向，纠正了对社会主义的错误想法，提高了组织起来走向集体化的热情和信心。浙江汤溪县的农民听到访苏农民代表陈双田的报告以后说：过去我们以为社会主义就是平均公有，大家一起干活，一起吃大锅饭，现在才晓得苏联是按劳取酬，多劳动的多得；犁地，摘棉花，挤牛奶都用机器，生活当然越过越好，我们要坚决走苏联的路！山西应县农民在知道了苏联农业集体化、机械化的情况后，仅四个区就有二百四十三户农民积极要求参加农业生产合作社，六百三十五个互助组重新整顿了组织，订出生产计划。山西平顺县本来流传着“山地没前途，迟早要搬家走，石厚土薄耕地少，发展生产到尽头”的说法，自从访苏农民代表李顺达带着电影队来进行宣传以后，农民们纷纷打消了下山的思想，忙着植树造林。他们说：李顺达的访苏报告是开心钥匙，使我们有了发展山地生产的办法了。在“中苏友好月”中，各地许多临时性的农业互助组转为常年互助组，无数单干的农民纷纷要求参加互助合作的组织。其他各阶层人民在“中苏友好月”中，也普遍提高了对苏联的认识。上海市北站区在街道居民中宣传苏联妇女参加社会活动和她们的幸福生活的情形以后，延吉里的三十多个从不出门的家庭妇女也组织了读报组，学习时事，并表示今后要积极参加各种工作。
    通过“中苏友好月”的各项宣传活动，苏联人民崇高的共产主义道德品质，更深刻地影响了全国广大人民。哈尔滨车辆工厂老工人张德祥过去不愿学习先进经验，他的产品有百分之四十五以上是废品。自从看到苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”以后，他深深被影片中老矿工聂道连的爱国主义精神所感动，他开始积极学习先进工作法，在短时期内已把生产效率提高了百分之七十，质量也达到合格率。在中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军各部队中，“普通一兵”、“日日夜夜”等书已成为战士们最喜爱的读本，干部和战士们从苏联英雄的形象中，深深了解到苏联军队的高尚品质和高度的组织性、纪律性、提高了向苏联军队学习的热情。许多医务工作人员看了苏联影片“乡村医生”后很受感动，工作更加积极。天津市第六卫生事务所医生姜秀荣说：我刚到卫生所的时候，看到设备很坏，认为自己走错了地方。我看到影片中乔木金那样的人，便不由得想起我当初不安心工作的情形，感到可耻，我现在决心要为郊区农民好好服务。全国青年学生更热火朝天地掀起了学习苏联优秀青年的高潮。在很多城市的书店里，“卓娅和舒拉的故事”等书有多少卖多少。各地的学校普遍举行座谈会、文艺晚会和故事会等，讨论苏联青年英雄卓娅、马特洛索夫、奥列格的英勇事迹，不少学校优秀的班都以苏联英雄的名字命名。由于学习苏联优秀青年刻苦学习的精神，广州市广雅中学初三丙班在“中苏友好月”中消灭了过去有些人功课不及格的现象，全体学生在最近一次考试中，平均成绩是八十三分。
    苏联文化工作者代表团、苏联艺术工作团、苏军红旗歌舞团和苏联电影艺术工作者代表团来我国参加“中苏友好月”活动，在各地和广大人民会见、联欢，大大加深了中苏人民的友谊。据初步统计，一个月来，他们曾在各地作了三十七次专题报告，参加了七十一次座谈会，正式演出了五十七次。我国的文化、艺术、科学工作者参加报告会和座谈的共有十几万人。各界群众观看苏联艺术家表演的约三十万人，另外有组织的从广播中收听他们演唱的群众在二千万人以上。各代表团还在各地访问了很多工厂、农村、机关、学校和影院，和广大人民举行了亲密愉快的联欢。在“中苏友好月”中，各地人民并和协助我国建设工作的苏联专家们举行联欢、座谈或邀请他们作报告；同时写信和苏联的英雄、模范及劳动人民建立联系，仅浙江省金华专区的人民就寄出了一万八千多封信件。这种广泛的接触，有效地增进了中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。
