    Central Personnel Department Letter Explains Technical Personnel Adjustments in Various Regions
    People's Daily Reader Letters Group: On December 9th, the "Reader Letters" column of the People's Daily published a summary of reader letters titled "Suggestion to Personnel Departments to Conduct Thorough Inspections and Correct Unreasonable Phenomena in the Use of Technical Personnel." We hereby briefly describe the situation of specialized technical personnel adjustments in various regions and our opinions as follows:
    Since the publication of the People's Daily editorial "Put Specialized Technical Personnel in the Positions Where Economic Construction Needs Them Most" on June 14th, the rational use of technical cadres has been given attention by various regions and departments. The Personnel Departments of the People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of major administrative regions, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, and the Personnel Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government have all ordered their respective local personnel departments to conduct in-depth investigations, comprehensive registration, and reasonable adjustments of specialized technical personnel who have not been rationally used. To this end, the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee issued the "Decision on the Registration and Allocation of Technical Cadres," and established a Technical Cadre Registration and Allocation Committee, and dispatched work teams to various places to conduct in-depth investigations. Provinces and cities generally deployed and implemented this work. The Personnel Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government conducted a comprehensive investigation on the use of graduates and technical personnel from various departments of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine in universities and colleges. Through methods such as symposiums, individual visits, and registration one by one, resolute adjustments were made to those who were improperly used.
    As a result of the above measures, various localities have successively adjusted a considerable number of improperly used technical cadres and transferred them to economic construction departments such as basic construction departments and factories and mines. For example, in the entire Northeast region (excluding figures from Rehe Province and Benxi City), 965 technical cadres have been adjusted, and the remaining 361 are being adjusted. In East China, 239 technical cadres have been directly adjusted by the East China Personnel Department; the remaining 624 are being adjusted by various provinces and cities themselves. A total of 109 industrial technical cadres directly under the Central-South organs have mismatched their studies and applications, and it has been decided to adjust all of them, of which 46 have been adjusted.
    In addition, personnel departments at all levels have received many letters regarding the irrational use of technical cadres, most of which contain correct requests and opinions, which have also played a significant role in the implementation of the policy of rationally adjusting technical cadres. However, some individual staff members do not have a comprehensive understanding of this policy. They have not proceeded from the specific circumstances and needs of our country, but one-sidedly emphasized or abstractly understood "consistency between learning and application," using this as a basis to demand adjustments. We should persuade and educate these staff members so that they can correctly understand the policy and work with peace of mind.
    Although the work of adjusting technical cadres has achieved certain results, the phenomenon of unreasonable use of technical cadres has not yet been completely corrected. The main reason, as pointed out in the editorial "Put Specialized Technical Personnel in the Positions Where Economic Construction Needs Them Most," is that some leading cadres of departments have departmentalism that disregards the overall situation, and lack sufficient understanding of the great significance of the rational use of specialized technical personnel. Therefore, they have not acted actively, one-sidedly emphasizing that their departments "need work" and "no one can replace them after leaving," and some have even adopted a passive and procrastinating attitude. Secondly, some leading cadres of departments and organs in charge of cadre work have not grasped this work tightly, have not conducted in-depth inspections, are not familiar with the situation, and therefore have no clear idea, their work is passive, and the handling is slow, which makes the phenomenon of unreasonable use of technical cadres not completely corrected. In order to conscientiously implement the policy of rationally using technical cadres and putting technical cadres in the positions where economic construction needs them most, especially in the positions of basic construction, leading organs at all levels and departments in charge of cadre work must resolutely fight against departmentalism and further check and correct the unreasonable phenomena in the use of technical cadres; those who have been registered and decided to be adjusted should be responsible for adjusting them as soon as possible. In the work of registration and adjustment, if it is found that someone is deliberately hoarding, "laying ambushes," or delaying and refusing to be transferred, they shall be dealt with as a violation of discipline.

### 中央人事部来信说明各地调整技术人材的情况

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央人事部来信说明各地调整技术人材的情况
    人民日报社读者来信组：十二月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了“建议人事部门深入检查纠正使用技术人员不合理的现象”读者来信综述。今将各地调整专门技术人材的情况和我们的意见简述如下：
    自六月十四日人民日报发表“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论后，合理地使用技术干部的问题，已受到各地区各部门的重视。各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）人事部、华北行政委员会民政局以及内蒙古自治区人民政府人事局均已命令所属各地人事部门，对未被合理使用的专门技术人材进行深入调查、普遍登记、合理调整。中南军政委员会为此特发布“关于登记与调配技术干部的决定”；并成立了技术干部登记调配委员会，且派出工作队分赴各地深入调查。各省、市一般也都布置并执行了这项工作。山西省人民政府人事厅对高等学校理、工、农、医各科系毕业生和技术人员的使用情况作了全面调查，通过座谈会、个别访问、逐一登记等办法，对使用不当者坚决进行了调整。
    由于采取了上述措施，各地已先后调整出相当数量使用不当的技术干部，转入基本建设部门及厂、矿企业等经济建设部门。如东北全区（缺热河省、本溪市的数字）已调整了九百六十五名技术干部，其余三百六十一名正在调整。华东有二百三十九名技术干部已经华东人事部直接调整完毕；其余六百二十四名正由各省、市自行调整中。中南直属机关共有一百零九名工业技术干部学用不一致，决定全部调整，现已调整四十六名。
    此外，各级人事部门收到了不少有关技术干部未被合理使用的来信，其中大多数的要求和意见是正确的，这对合理调整技术干部政策的贯彻也起了很大作用。但尚有个别工作人员对这一政策的领会不够全面，他们没有从我们国家的具体情况和需要出发，而是片面强调或抽象地理解“学用一致”，借此要求调整工作。我们对这些工作人员应说服教育，使他们能够正确领会政策，安心工作。
    调整技术干部的工作虽然获得了一定的成绩；但不合理使用技术干部的现象，目前仍未彻底纠正。其主要原因，正如“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”社论中所指出的，是由于某些部门领导干部存在着不顾大局的本位主义思想，对合理使用专门技术人材的重大意义认识不足，因而尚未积极行动起来，片面强调本部门“工作需要”、
    “离开后没有人代替”，有的甚至采取消极拖延的态度。其次，有些部门领导干部和掌管干部工作的机关，对此项工作的处理抓得不紧，没有深入检查，熟悉情况，因此心中无数，工作被动，处理迟缓，这就使得使用技术干部不合理的现象没有得到彻底的纠正。为认真贯彻合理地使用技术干部的方针，把技术干部放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去，特别是基本建设的岗位上去，各级领导机关和掌管干部工作的部门必须坚决地与本位主义思想作斗争，进一步检查纠正使用技术干部不合理的现象；已登记并决定调整者，应负责地尽速予以调整。在登记与调整工作中，如发现有故意积压，“打埋伏”或拖延不服调动者，应以违反纪律论处。
