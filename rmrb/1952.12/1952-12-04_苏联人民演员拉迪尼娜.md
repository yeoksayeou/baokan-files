　　Soviet People's Artist Ladynina
    Ye Yao
    Many Chinese audiences have seen Soviet musical comedy films such as "A Happy Life," "Tractor Drivers," and "A Wealthy Bride," etc. When people watched these films full of the joy of labor, they became familiar with the heroines in the films: Bi Bailing, Mariana, Marinka..., and people were attracted by these brilliant images. Especially the image of Bi Bailing in "A Happy Life" produced an unforgettable and beautiful impression in the hearts of our audience. The talented film actress Ladynina, who played these heroines, is one of the representatives of the Soviet film art workers delegation who came to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Before she even arrived in China, young students in Beijing were spreading the word: "Bi Bailing is coming!" They were so excited and eagerly awaiting her arrival.
    As soon as the Soviet film art workers delegation arrived in Beijing, they met with the Chinese people in factories, rural areas, troops, schools, and cinemas, and the Chinese people warmly welcomed them.
    At the Sino-Soviet film actors' symposium, the reporter met Ladynina. The heroines she played in films such as "A Wealthy Bride," "Pastoral Scene" (originally "The Pig Herder and the Shepherd"), "Tractor Drivers," "Siberian Symphony," and "A Happy Life" were all very successful. The Soviet government has a very high evaluation of her work. She has been awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and has won the Stalin Prize five times. In 1950, she was awarded the honorary title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union. When she talked about these honors, she said, "Winning the Stalin Prize is the highest commendation for me. What could be happier than this!"
    Her outstanding achievements are due not only to her great talent, but mainly to her diligent work. She did everything that the characters she created should do. She was born in an ordinary peasant family in Siberia, and she is familiar with the lives of the people. When she became a film actress, she continued to learn from life and from creating characters. This learning is sometimes very difficult. Many of the characters she created are ordinary Soviet women. She said that when she created these characters, she first observed them and learned about their lives. When she played Grasha in "Pastoral Scene," she was initially a little afraid of those pigs. The first time she learned to feed the pigs, so many pigs ran around and moved around that she simply dared not walk, fearing that the pigs would make her fall. Only after she learned how to feed the pigs with the pig herder did she perform well in the scene where Grasha raised pigs. When she played Mariana in "Tractor Drivers," she went to the fields to learn to drive a tractor. When she played Valia in "Six O'Clock After the War," she learned machine gun shooting from female soldiers who had participated in the war. She asked the female soldiers, "Can I learn it?" They replied, "That depends on whether your hands develop calluses. If not, you have to keep learning!" When she played Bi Bailing in "A Happy Life," she went to the Kuban Cossack collective farm in Ukraine to live with the farmers and observe how people walked, how they moved, and how they spoke. When filming this film, she needed to learn the tone and grammar of the Kuban farmers in Ukraine. The Ukrainian tone is different from the tone in central Russia. She cited many examples to illustrate the difference. She not only learned to speak Kuban when she lived with the farmers, but also spoke Kuban when she went home and was with her son. She said to her son in Kuban, "Why don't you go play?" The son said, "Mom, you'd better talk to me in your mother's tone, not in your Bi Bailing's tone!" Therefore, her son did not call her mother at home, but called her Bi Bailing. From here we can see that when she created a character, she completely melted the character into her own life. She completed the role from life, and the role was already mature when she went on camera. During her acting period, even her lifestyle changed. When she first arrived in the Kuban countryside, she wore the skirts that Kuban women loved to wear and found it very inconvenient to walk, but when she returned to Moscow from Kuban, she felt uncomfortable wearing the skirts she used to wear. Playing the role of Bi Bailing required learning to ride a horse and knowing something about the life of horse breeders. Ladynina went to approach the horse breeders in the farm, talked to them, asked questions, and said a lot. The horse breeders in the farm asked her, "Why do you talk so much? Do you want to work in the stable? After you finish filming, work in our stable!" That's how deeply she experienced life and observed the characters she portrayed.
    Soviet actors not only delve deeply into the lives of the people and learn from the people, but sometimes cooperate directly with the masses. When they were filming "Six O'Clock After the War," many Red Army soldiers who had fought in the war participated in the filming of mass scenes; in "A Happy Life," many collective farmers participated in mass scenes such as market days and horse races. People not only see their own lives in the film, but also see people they know or themselves in the film. Many Soviet actors come from the people. Some are of worker origin, and some are of peasant origin.
    Ladynina said that the Soviet people love Soviet film art very much, and film actors often receive letters from audiences from all over the country. Once she received a letter from a farm boy with "To Bi Bailing" written on the envelope. The boy said that he and his mother wanted to join Bi Bailing's collective farm, and asked her to be sure to agree to him.
    Ladynina also received a letter from another rural girl, asking where the pig herder Grasha in "Pastoral Scene" was. Ladynina said, "It seems strange, but it's not strange, because these characters in the film lived in reality. People know them and love them." This is precisely because Ladynina's artistic talent created unforgettable images.
    Soviet film art has developed along with the development of the lives of the Soviet people, and the development and changes of the Soviet Union can be seen from the film. "If the role changes, then life has developed." Ladynina said that Marlina, whom she played in "A Wealthy Bride," used her hands to work, while in "Tractor Drivers" she used a tractor to cultivate the land, and in "A Happy Life," the farmers were already using combine harvesters. She is proud to be engaged in this work of portraying the lives of the people.
    When filming the film "Pastoral Scene," German aircraft circled over Moscow all day long, bombing every day, for three months. But their filming work did not stop, and they completed the film in air-raid shelters. She said, "We believe that the people can win." Therefore, on that smoky land, they filmed a film full of joyful emotions. The film was shown on the front lines of the anti-fascist war at that time, which greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the Red Army soldiers. They saw the joy and invincible power of the people from the cruel war.
    When Ladynina talked about the study and life of Soviet film actors, she said: "An actor needs to learn a lot, and he needs to have all aspects of education. He needs to know not only the present, but also the history." The Soviet Film Actors Theater is a place where film actors live and study, and it is also a production factory. Actors rehearse plays, practice vocals, and recite poems in the theater. The theater not only has teachers in the field of performance, but also has physical education teachers and singing teachers. If actors want to learn to ride a horse, there are also people to teach them. All actors participate in political study and study Marxism-Leninism. In addition, there is also a "Film Workers' Home." In this organization, the films that are being released are often discussed. Many actors participate in social activities, and some actors are Soviet representatives. They often go to factories and rural areas to hold concerts and participate in discussions. Many film actors also go to various parts of the country to participate in performances. Not long ago, Ladynina went to her hometown of Siberia to perform.
    When asked what the difference is between stage actors and film actors based on her experience, she said: "The two arts are basically the same. Only the way of expression is different. On the stage, the actor's movements need to be more prominent and obvious. In the film, the actor needs to be more subtle and softer. Especially close-ups, maybe there are many emotions in the character's heart, but you should more accurately measure whether the emotions in your heart and the external movements are balanced. On the stage, the actor's emotions can directly communicate with the audience, but it is not the case in the film." She said that when she first made a film, there was a scene that she couldn't play well. Suddenly, some people came from outside to visit, and the more people watched, the better the scene was played. The director told her: "It's not okay to act only when there is an audience in front of you, because film actors don't have this condition." She said that another difference is that when stage actors speak on the stage, they generally have an opponent, but film actors have no opponent when shooting. She felt very difficult at first, but now she only needs the photographer and the lighting. She said: "It feels more comfortable this way."
    Peliev is one of the masters of Soviet comedy films. He is the director of "A Happy Life," "Tractor Drivers," "A Wealthy Bride," "Pastoral Scene," and "Siberian Symphony," and Ladynina is the star of these films. When the reporter asked her about Soviet comedy films, she said: "Soviet comedy films affirm life and are optimistic. This is the opposite of the principles of bourgeois comedy, which negate life and maliciously ridicule people. Our comedy actors should be more serious. There is a Russian proverb: 'Jokes are serious,' which is what it means. If the actors in comedy do not create seriously, they will not cause the audience to laugh healthily. Comedy actors need higher skills."
    At the meeting with the masses and at the symposium with Chinese film actors, Ladynina sang the song she sang in "A Happy Life," and sang it very well. This song is not only very popular in the Soviet Union, but also very popular among young students in China. When asked why she could sing so well, she said modestly: "First of all, the song is well written. This song is in line with Bi Bailing's character, so it is loved by people. Secondly, it is because the singer sings well." She cited the song "Round and Round" in the "Maxim Trilogy" as an example, saying: "The Soviet audience likes it very much because it is in line with Maxim's character. The songs I sing are popular for the same reason."

　　苏联人民演员拉迪尼娜
    叶遥
    中国许多观众看过苏联的音乐喜剧影片：《幸福的生活》、《拖拉机手》、《富裕的未婚妻》等，当人们看了这些充满着劳动欢乐的影片时，人们在银幕上熟识了影片中的女主角：毕百灵、玛丽亚娜、玛琳卡……，人们为这些光辉的形象所吸引。尤其《幸福的生活》中的毕百灵的形象，在我们观众的心里，产生了难忘的、美好的印象。扮演这些女主角的天才电影演员拉迪尼娜，是这次来我国参加“中苏友好月”的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团代表之一。当她还没到中国时，北京市的青年学生中就在传说：“毕百灵要来了！”他们是那么兴奋、热切地等待着她的到来。
    苏联电影艺术工作者代表团一来到北京，就分别到工厂、农村、部队、学校、电影院和中国人民见面，中国人民热烈地欢迎了他们。
    在中苏电影演员座谈会上，记者会见了拉迪尼娜。她在《富裕的未婚妻》、《牧场风光》（原名《养猪女与牧羊郎》）、《拖拉机手》、《西伯利亚交响曲》、《幸福的生活》等影片中扮演的女主角，都是十分成功的。苏联政府对于她的工作有很高评价。她曾荣获劳动红旗勋章，得过五次斯大林奖金，一九五○年她更获得苏联人民演员的光荣称号。当她谈到她的这些荣誉时说：“获得斯大林奖金，对我是最高的褒奖，除此之外，还有什么比这更幸福呢！”
    她的卓越成就，除了她具有非常的天才外，主要的靠她勤奋地工作，她做到了她所创造的角色应做的一切。她出生于西伯利亚的一个普通农民家庭里，她对于人民的生活是熟悉的。当她成为电影演员时，她仍不断从生活中学习，从创造角色中学习。这种学习有时是很艰苦的。她所创造的许多角色，都是苏联普通的妇女。她说她创造这些人物时，首先去观察这些人物，了解她们的生活。当她演《牧场风光》中的格拉莎时，最初她有点怕那些猪。她第一次学喂猪时，那样多的猪乱跑乱动，她简直不敢走路，怕猪会使自己摔跤。当她和养猪女学会了如何喂猪后，她才很好地演了格拉莎养猪的那场面。当扮《拖拉机手》中的玛丽亚娜时，她到田地里学开拖拉机。她扮演《战后晚上六点钟》的瓦丽亚时，她曾向参加过战争的女战士们学习机枪射击。她曾问过女战士们：“我能学会吗？”她们回答：“那要看你手上起不起茧，如果不会，还要继续学呀！”当她演《幸福的生活》中的毕百灵时，曾到乌克兰的库班哥萨克集体农庄中去，和农民生活在一起，观察人们怎样走路，怎样动作，怎样说话。在演这部影片时，她需要学习乌克兰的库班农民说话的音调和语法。乌克兰的音调和俄罗斯中部的音调是不同的。她举了不少例子说明它的不同。她不但和农民生活在一起时学说库班话，就是回到家里和她儿子在一起时也说库班话。她对儿子用库班话说：“你为什么不去玩？”儿子说：“妈妈，你最好给我说话时用你妈妈的口气说，不要用你毕百灵的口气说！”因此，她的儿子在家里不叫她妈妈，而叫她毕百灵。从这里我们可以看出，她在创造一个角色时，完全把角色融化在她自己的生活里了。她从生活里去完成角色，在她上镜头时，角色已经成熟了。她在演戏期间，甚至生活习惯也有了变化。当她刚到库班农村时，穿起库班妇女爱穿的裙子，觉得走路很不方便，但当她从库班回到莫斯科时，再穿上自己过去常穿的裙子反觉得不习惯了。演毕百灵这一角色，需要学会骑马，需要知道一些养马人的生活，拉迪尼娜曾去接近农庄中的养马人，和他们谈话，问这问那，话说的特别多。农庄中的养马人问她：“你的话怎么这样多？你是不是想在马房里工作？等你拍完电影，就在我们马房里工作吧！”她就是如此深入地体验生活，观察她所表现的人物的。
    苏联的演员不但如此深入人民的生活，向人民学习，而且有时是直接和群众合作的。当他们拍《战后晚上六点钟》时，许多曾经作过战的红军战士参加了群众场面的拍摄；在《幸福的生活》中，许多集体农民参加了集市、赛马等群众场面。人民不但从影片里看到自己的生活，而且可以在影片里看到自己熟识的人或者是自己。苏联许多演员都是从人民中间来的。有的是工人出身，有的是农民出身。
    拉迪尼娜谈到苏联人民非常热爱苏联的电影艺术，电影演员时常接到观众从各地寄来的信。有一次她接到一个农庄男孩子的信，信封上写着“毕百灵收”。那位男孩子说，他和他的母亲想参加毕百灵的集体农庄，请她务必答应他。
    拉迪尼娜还接到另一个农村姑娘的来信，她问那个《牧场风光》中的养猪女格拉莎在什么地方。拉迪尼娜说：“看起来，这好像很奇怪，其实并不奇怪，因为影片中的这些人物在现实中生活过。人民熟悉她们，敬爱她们。”这也正是因为拉迪尼娜的艺术天才创造了使人难忘的形象。
    苏联电影艺术是跟着苏联人民生活的发展而发展的，从电影里可以看出苏联的发展和变化。“如果角色变了，那就是生活发展了。”拉迪尼娜说她在《富裕的未婚妻》中扮演的玛琳卡是用手劳动的，在《拖拉机手》中就用拖拉机耕地了，在《幸福的生活》中，农民已经使用联合收割机了。她为从事这种表现人民生活的工作而骄傲。
    当拍摄《牧场风光》影片时，德寇的飞机整天盘旋在莫斯科上空，天天轰炸，继续了三个月。但他们的拍摄工作没有停止，他们在防空洞里完成这部影片。她说：“我们相信人民能胜利。”所以，就在那烟火弥漫的土地上，他们拍出了充满着欢乐情绪的影片。这部影片当时曾在反法西斯战争前线放映，大大鼓舞了红军战士的斗志，他们从残酷的战争中看到了人民的欢乐和不可战胜的力量。
    拉迪尼娜谈到苏联电影演员的学习、生活时说：“一个演员需要学习的很多，他需要有各方面的教养。不但需要知道现代，也需要知道历史。”苏联电影演员剧院，是电影演员们生活和学习的地方，也是生产的工厂。演员们在剧院中排练戏、练声和朗诵诗歌等。剧院里不但有关于表演方面的教师，也有体育教师，歌唱教师，如果演员想学骑马，也有人教。所有的演员都参加政治学习，学习马克思列宁主义。此外，还有一个“电影工作者之家”，在这个组织里，经常讨论上映的影片。许多演员都参加社会活动，演员中有的是苏维埃代表。他们经常到工厂、农村去开音乐会、参加讨论会等。很多电影演员还去全国各地参加演出。不久以前，拉迪尼娜曾到她的故乡西伯利亚演出过。
    当问到根据她的体会舞台演员与电影演员有何不同时，她说：“这两种艺术基本上是相同的。只是表现方法上有些不同。在舞台上，演员的动作需要更突出些，明显些。在电影里，演员需要含蓄一些，柔和一些。尤其是特写镜头，也许角色内心的感情很多，但应更精确地衡量你内心的感情和外形动作是否平衡。在舞台上，演员的感情可以直接和观众交流，在电影里就不是这样。”她谈到她最初拍电影时，曾有一场戏总演不好，突然从外边来了一些参观的人，看的人一多，那场戏反而演的很好。导演告诉她：“面前有观众才能演戏，这样是不成的，因为电影演员没有这种条件。”她说，两者还有一种不同是舞台演员在舞台上讲话时，一般是有对方的，但电影演员在拍摄时是没对手的。她最初很感困难，但现在她只需要摄影师和灯光就够了，她说：“这样感到更舒服些。”
    培利耶夫是苏联喜剧片的艺术大师之一，是《幸福的生活》、《拖拉机手》、《富裕的未婚妻》、《牧场风光》、《西伯利亚交响曲》等片的导演，拉迪尼娜又是主演这些片子的。当记者询问她关于苏联电影喜剧的问题时，她说：“苏联的喜剧电影是肯定生活的，乐观主义的。与资产阶级的喜剧原则恰恰相反，他们否定生活，恶意地嘲笑人。我们的喜剧演员应更严肃。俄罗斯有句谚语：‘笑话是严肃的’，就是这种意思。如果喜剧中的演员不严肃地创造，也不会引起观众健康的笑。喜剧演员需要更高的技巧。”
    拉迪尼娜在和群众见面的大会上，在和中国电影演员座谈会上，唱了她在《幸福的生活》中唱的那支歌子，唱的很好。这只歌子不但在苏联很流行，在中国青年学生中也很流行，问她为什么能唱得这么好时，她谦逊地说：“首先是歌子写的好。这只歌子和毕百灵的性格相符合，所以它才为人喜爱，其次才是歌唱者唱的好坏。”她举《马克辛三部曲》影片中的《团团转》一歌为例说：“苏联观众很喜欢它，因为它和马克辛的性格相符合。我唱的歌很流行，也是这个原因。”
