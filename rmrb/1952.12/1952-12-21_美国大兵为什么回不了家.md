Why Can't American Soldiers Go Home?
Li Gao

In an atmosphere of bitter cold, exhaustion, death, and terror, the invading American troops in Korea are facing their third despairing "Christmas" in a land they do not understand.

These people who are looking forward to going home day and night dreamed two years ago of MacArthur's promise of "Christmas at home"; a year ago, they held an "automatic ceasefire"; and more than a month ago, there was new hope, because one of their presidential candidates repeatedly stated that he would "work hard to end the Korean War." However, hopes and dreams have been shattered one by one with time. When the Christmas lights are lit in their homes 5,000 miles away this year, what awaits them is still—and even more miserably—bitter cold, exhaustion, death, and terror.

The 5,000-mile road home doesn't seem too far with modern transportation, but for American soldiers, it's harder than going to Mars.

Why can't American soldiers always go home? They probably find it difficult to find an answer. But as long as they think calmly, elementary mathematics can help them find the answer.

Here is a statistical table of the US industrial production index and corporate profits. To make the problem clearer, it is helpful to look at the numbers from earlier years.

In 1943, the year with the most bloodshed in World War II, American arms dealers made a record profit of $10.3 billion, more than three times the $3.3 billion in the peaceful year of 1938. In 1946, when people were celebrating the arrival of peace, US production plummeted by a quarter. In the following years, rearmament could not stop the trend of continued decline in US industrial production. On the eve of the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the shadow of economic crisis was already lingering in front of the doors of American markets and factories. However, the war ignited by MacArthur in Korea temporarily changed this situation. US industrial production increased by 13.8 percent compared to 1949; American capitalists' profits increased to the astronomical figure of $41 billion. In 1951, when tens of thousands of American soldiers continued to die on the Korean battlefield, American arms dealers were ten times more prosperous, US industrial production increased by another 10 percent compared to the previous year, and American capitalists' profits increased to $42.9 billion, twelve times more than in the peaceful years before World War II.

That's how it is; the peak of American capitalists' profits is closely linked to war, death, and bloodshed. Unfortunately, the US state machine and the lives of American soldiers are precisely in the hands of this small group of capitalists who have an indissoluble bond with war. These people read the word "peace" as "bankruptcy," "crisis," "depression," and "risk." When the second agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations was agreed upon last November, and when the United States rumored that the Korean armistice was about to be realized this April, the New York stock market experienced a sharp decline. How many American capitalists broke out in a cold sweat! How can we let the war stop? Wall Street representative and atomic bomb fanatic Baruch had already concluded: "In a fierce time of war, peace seems very beautiful, but after the war stops, it is almost the most annoying." Wall Street's "Business Week" recently analyzed it even more thoroughly: "A truce will make the predicted industrial and commercial contraction almost a certainty," while "the failure of ceasefire efforts will stimulate industrial and commercial development" and "delay the expected economic contraction."

That's how people saw the yawning, unreasonableness, and absenteeism of the American negotiators in Panmunjom, until the announcement of an "indefinite adjournment"; people also saw that battles, destruction, and death were constantly occurring on the already planned ceasefire line. The lives and the desire to go home of American soldiers, and the anxiety, crying, and prayers of American families, have all been thrown to the winds.

Moreover, things are still developing. Since this year, American monopoly capitalists shook their computers and exclaimed in surprise: It's terrible, the current scale of the Korean War and the current speed of military expansion are not enough to delay the crisis and maintain maximum profits. Signs of production contraction are emerging everywhere in various departments. What to do? Expand the war. Who will do it? Truman is useless, replace him with a more vicious general. So, people saw that Eisenhower was dragged to the White House by American monopoly capitalists like a dung beetle pushing a ball of dung.

In just one month, the elected Eisenhower has already proved that he will never fail the expectations of the Wall Street masters who promoted him. A new cabinet list was announced: every important position was filled with representatives directly sent by Wall Street, all of whom had a long list of titles such as "General Manager" and "Chairman" of certain companies. Before Eisenhower took office, he had already held meeting after meeting with a group of monopoly capitalists and American generals, racking their brains to plan the expansion of the Korean War.

Eisenhower "fulfilled" his campaign promise, made a trip to Korea and went back, but his statement frankly told others that he was not here to "end the Korean War," but to end his own promise. How loudly he slapped his own face. Listen, this general, who repeatedly stated more than a month ago that he would "end the Korean War on the spot," is now saying: "I have always said that we are here (referring to Korea) to understand the situation. We have no panacea or trick to solve any problems. … What is needed is to continue to dedicate ourselves to the common goal that we have revealed so far and will continue to pursue.” "Ending the war" quietly became "continuing the war." How to explain this to the American soldiers who yearn to go home? Eisenhower said very frankly, "He believes that there will be more sacrifices in the future, but these are smart sacrifices that the people can afford" (UPI Honolulu, December 12). American soldiers, listen: Don't think about going home, but "sacrifice smartly"!

Now, the biggest obstacle facing the American monopoly capitalists and American generals' plan to expand the war is the strength of the Chinese and Korean people's forces. This group of gamblers held several meetings in Korea, on Wake Island, and on cruisers in the Pacific. Eisenhower returned to New York and babbled with MacArthur, who was solely focused on expanding the war, for a long time. But after calculating, the stakes were not enough and they could not afford the cost of huge casualties. So, even though they had a "briefcase" full of "offensive" plans, they did not dare to think big rashly, but only wanted to carry out some kind of "limited offensive."

(This is not because they feel sorry for the deaths of too many American soldiers, but because they are afraid of losing the game and not being able to step down.) However, regardless of the size of the bet, the large-scale death of American soldiers is destined. The recent bet placed by American generals under Shangganling has provided a good example. On this small position of three square kilometers, they lost 25,000 people without gaining an inch of land. If next year's "spring limited offensive" really appears, how many American soldiers will never be able to go home! American soldiers who want to go home, be careful of this unbearable "Christmas gift" prepared for you by your domestic monopoly capitalists and president generals!

    美国大兵为什么回不了家
    李高
    在严寒、疲惫、死亡、恐怖的气氛里，侵朝美军在他们所不了解的国土上，面临第三个绝望的“圣诞节”了。
    这些日日夜夜盼望着回家的人们，两年前做过麦克阿瑟答应他们的“圣诞节回家”之梦；一年前，他们举行过“自动停火”；一个多月前还有过新的希望，因为他们的一个总统候选人一再声明要“努力结束朝鲜战争”。可是，希望和梦想一个一个随着时间破灭了。当今年五千浬外的家园里点起圣诞夜的火树银花的时候，他们面前的还是只有——而且是更凄惨的严寒、疲惫、死亡和恐怖。
    五千浬回家的路在近代的交通情况下看来并不太远，可是在美国大兵看来却比通向火星还难。
    为什么美国大兵总是回不了家呢？他们很可能难以找到解答。但只要他们冷静地想一想，用初等数学就能帮助他们找到答案。
    这里有一张美国的工业生产指数和公司利润统计表。为了把问题看得明显一点，不妨从早几年的数字一直看下来。
    一九四三年，这是第二次世界大战流血最多的一年，可是美国的军火商就捞到了一百零三亿美元的空前高额利润，比一九三八年和平年代的三十三亿美元多了两倍余。一九四六年，当人们庆幸和平到来了的时候，美国的生产却猛跌了四分之一。以后的几年，重新备战也阻不住美国工业生产继续降低的趋势。一九五○年朝鲜战争爆发的前夕，经济危机的魔影已经徘徊在美国的市场和制造厂门前了，但是，麦克阿瑟在朝鲜挑起的战火暂时改变了这种情势，美国的工业生产在这一年比一九四九年增加了百分之十三点八；美国资本家的利润增到了四百十亿美元的天文数字。一九五一年，当成万的美国大兵在朝鲜战场上继续死去的时候，美国的军火商却更加利市十倍，美国的工业生产又比前一年增涨了百分之十，美国资本家的利润增加到四百二十九亿美元了，比第二次世界大战以前的和平年代多了十二倍。
    事情就是这样的，美国资本家的利润高峰是紧紧地跟战争、死亡、流血联系在一起的。不幸的是，美国的国家机器和美国大兵的生命却正好是掌握在这一小群和战争结了不解缘的资本家手里。这些人把“和平”两个字读作“破产”、“危机”、“萧条”和“风险”。当去年十一月朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程达成协议的时候，当今年四月美国谣传朝鲜停战即将实现的时候，纽约的股票市场都发生了猛跌的风潮。多少美国资本家出了一身冷汗啊！怎能让战争停止呢？华尔街代表原子弹狂巴鲁克早就作过结论：“在凶恶的战时，和平似乎是很美好的，但在战争停止后，它差不多是最讨厌的。”华尔街的
    “商业周刊”最近分析得更透彻：“休战将使人们所预言的工商业萎缩几乎成为一件肯定的事情”，而
    “停火努力的失败，将能刺激工商业”，使“预期到来的经济萎缩得到延迟”。
    就是这样，人们看到了板门店美国谈判代表的打哈欠、不讲理、逃会，直到宣布“无限期休会”；人们也看到了早已规划好了的停火线上却在不断地发生战斗、毁灭和死亡。美国大兵的性命和回家的愿望，美国家庭的焦虑、哭泣和祈祷，都被人抛在九霄云外。
    而且事情还在发展。今年以来，美国的垄断资本家们摇一摇计算机，吃惊地叫道：不得了，朝鲜战争当前的规模和扩军备战当前的速度，已经不足以延缓危机、维持最大利润了。生产萎缩的苗头已经在各个部门中到处涌现。怎么办呢？扩大战争。谁来办呢？杜鲁门不中用了，换一个更凶恶的将军罢。于是，人们看到，艾森豪威尔被美国的垄断资本家们像“屎格郎”推蛋一样拖向白宫了。
    时间不过一月，当选的艾森豪威尔却已经证明了他绝不会辜负一手提拔他的华尔街主子们的期望。新的内阁名单宣布了：每一个重要职位上都放上了华尔街直接派出的代表，他们都是有一长串某某公司“总经理”、“董事长”头衔的人物。艾森豪威尔还没有上任，他就已经和一群垄断资本家和美国将军左一个会议，右一个会议，绞尽脑汁来策划扩大朝鲜战争了。
    艾森豪威尔“实现”了他在竞选时的诺言，到朝鲜来跑了一趟回去了，但是他的声明直率地告诉别人，他不是来“结束朝鲜战争”的，而是来结束他自己的诺言的。他把自己的嘴吧打得多响。听吧，这个一个多月前一再声明要“就地结束朝鲜战争”的将军，现在说的是：“我早就说过，我们到这里
    （指朝鲜）来是为了了解情况的。我们没有能够解决任何问题的万灵药和诀窍。……所需要的就是继续致力于迄今为止我们所揭示并将继续追求的共同目标。”“结束战争”悄悄地变成“继续战争”了。怎么向渴望回家的美国大兵交代呢？艾森豪威尔说得很爽直，“他认为今后将有更多的牺牲，但是这些是人民能够负担的聪明的牺牲”（合众社檀香山十二日电）。美国大兵们听着：不要想回家，而去“聪明地牺牲”吧！
    现在，摆在美国垄断资本家们和美国将军扩大战争计划面前的最大障碍，就是中朝人民力量的强大。这群赌徒在朝鲜、在威克岛、在太平洋的巡洋舰上开了好几次会议，艾森豪威尔回到纽约又和那个一心只想扩大战争的麦克阿瑟嘀咕了半天，但是算来算去，赌本不够，付不起巨大伤亡的代价。所以他们尽管有了“一皮包”的“攻势”计划，但不敢贸然想什么大的，而只想搞个什么“有限攻势”。
    （这并不是他们觉得美国大兵死多了可惜，而是怕输垮了下不了台。）但是，不管赌注的大小如何，美国兵的大量死亡是注定了的。最近美国将军向上甘岭下的赌注已经提供了很好的榜样，在这个三平方公里的狭小阵地上，赔了二万五千人还没有换得一寸土地。明年的“春季有限攻势”如果真的出现的话，要有多少美国大兵永远回不了家啊！想回家的美国大兵们，当心你们国内的垄断资本家和总统将军们给你们预备的这一份吃不消“圣诞礼物”！
