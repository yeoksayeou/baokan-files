Worker Zhang Mingshan of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill, successfully created the "anti-wrap disc" for rolling mills, enabling the full automation of the process of precision rolling of 32mm to 19mm round steel in small rolling mills, and providing a method for full automation of the process of rolling even finer steel. After the rolling mill was equipped with the "anti-wrap disc," the output of round steel increased by 45 percent, the quality improved by 6 percent, and the labor force was reduced by 70 percent. The service life of the rolling grooves and guide plates was also extended by two times, enabling the small rolling mill to increase production and save 132.1 billion yuan for the country each year, and eliminating the burns and occupational diseases that had long damaged the health of workers.

In the past, the rolling mills and equipment of small factories were all of the "German" type. The rolling mills were arranged with several machines lined up horizontally in the center of the factory building. Steel billets at a high temperature of over 1,000 degrees Celsius had to continuously pass through five different rolling holes to be made into small round steel. During the rolling process, electric roller conveyors sent the steel billets one after another into the square rolling holes, and then drilled back from the square rolling holes into the semi-circular rolling holes. When the rolled steel billet rushed out of the semi-circular rolling hole in one second, it turned into a 15-foot-long fire snake. Workers had to hold short tongs and, as soon as the steel billet came out of the semi-circular rolling hole, clamp it head-on, turn around, and send it into the circular rolling hole. This easily led to burn accidents due to the tongs not clamping tightly. During the period of the puppet Manchukuo regime, half of the tong-clamping workers suffered from occupational diseases, and burns accounted for 45 percent. Many tong-clamping workers were strong young men when they entered the factory, but were soon dismissed from the factory due to burns and occupational diseases. Workers used the tragic song "Small factory is the Yama's palace, tong-clamping workers exchange their lives" to describe this harsh environment.

After liberation, from the first day of work, the factory leaders, in addition to trying various methods to improve working conditions, regarded "full automation of the precision rolling process of rolling mills" as the central task for increasing production and improving working conditions, and called on workers to study and solve it. Worker Zhang Mingshan had been working in the factory for more than 20 years and knew the suffering of the tong-clamping workers well. He said, "We must relieve everyone of this pain!" However, he remembered that Japanese engineers had failed many times during the puppet Manchukuo regime, so he began to doubt whether he could succeed. In March 1950, Zhang Mingshan joined the Communist Party of China, and under the education and encouragement of the Party, he gained unlimited creative courage. He thought while working every day, and used his lunch break to go to the rolling mill to carefully observe the steel outlet; at night, he returned home and made models of the "anti-wrap disc" out of scrap cardboard boxes and clay, and then split a bamboo board as a steel billet to study the principle of "automation." In November 1950, Zhang Mingshan conducted an experiment that was unsuccessful, and in October 1951, the experiment failed again, and some technical personnel and workers were discouraged. At this time, Soviet expert Vasiliev gave him great inspiration and encouragement, and suggested that the small factory include Zhang Mingshan's research work in the factory's technical measures plan. After Zhang Mingshan created a rough version of the "anti-wrap disc," Vasiliev helped him design the technically complex "torsion" pipe. After two years and eight months of arduous research, Zhang Mingshan finally created the "anti-wrap disc" that automatically allowed semi-circular steel billets to enter circular rolling holes. The experiment was successful on September 14 this year. The steel billet obediently passed repeatedly through several differently shaped rolling holes and drilled straight out of the finished product hole. All the factory workers were overjoyed to see this situation, and Zhang Mingshan was lifted high. The factory director hugged Zhang Mingshan tightly and said, "Old Zhang, you have solved a big problem for our small factory."

The success of Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "anti-wrap disc" educated many technical personnel and cadres with conservative ideas. Engineer Zhou Renyuan said, "I have read the German 'Steel Handbook' and the papers of American rolling experts, and none of these books have solved this problem." He deeply regretted his erroneous view of blindly worshiping capitalist countries, and went to the factory director's home in the middle of the night to express to the factory director: "I must correct my erroneous thinking, further strive to learn from the Soviet Union, and better serve the construction of the motherland."

After Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "anti-wrap disc" was successful, the Anshan Municipal People's Government, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Anshan Federation of Trade Unions jointly decided to approve Zhang Mingshan as a special-class labor model of Anshan in 1952; and awarded him 10 million yuan in RMB. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions also sent telegrams to Zhang Mingshan to congratulate him. The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government has sent technical cadres to the factory to measure and draw the "anti-wrap disc" drawings and conduct measurement work on operating technology in order to promote this advanced experience to rolling mills in various regions.

    国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂工人
    张明山创造轧钢机“反围盘”成功
    为轧制精细钢材过程全部自动化提供了方法
    国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂工人张明山，创造了轧钢机上的“反围盘”，使小型轧钢厂精轧三十二糎至十九糎圆钢的过程全部自动化，并为轧制更细的钢材过程全部自动化提供了方法。轧钢机安装上“反围盘”以后，圆钢的产量提高了百分之四十五，质量提高了百分之六，劳动力节省百分之七十。轧槽与导板的使用寿命也延长了二倍，使小型轧钢厂每年可为国家增产节约一千三百二十一亿元，并根除了长期损害工人健康的烫伤和职业病。
    过去小型厂的轧钢机和设备都是“德意志”式的。轧钢机的设置，是几部机器横排在厂房中央。一千多度高温的钢坯，必须连续经过五道不同的轧孔压延，才能制成小圆钢。在轧制过程中，电动的滚道把钢坯一根接一根地送进方形轧孔，再从方型轧孔回钻入偏圆型轧孔，被压轧的钢坯在一秒钟内从偏圆形轧孔窜出来时就变成一丈五尺长的火蛇。工人必须手持短钳，待钢坯钻出偏圆形轧孔就迎头钳住，转身再把它送进圆形轧孔内。这就容易因钳夹不紧而发生烫伤事故。在伪满统治时，有一半的夹钳工人得职业病，烫伤的占百分之四十五。很多夹钳工人进厂时是健壮的小伙子，但不久就因烫伤、害职业病被开除出厂。工人用“小型厂是阎王殿，夹钳工用命换”的悲惨歌子来形容这种恶劣环境。
    解放后从开工那一天起，该厂领导上除想各种办法改善劳动条件外，就以“轧钢机的精轧过程全部自动化”，当作提高产量和改善劳动条件的中心课题，号召工人研究解决。工人张明山是在该厂干了二十来年的老工人，深知夹钳工人的苦处，他说：“我们一定要给大家解除这个痛苦！”可是，他想起伪满统治时期，日本工程师多次试验都失败了，于是对自己能否成功发生了怀疑。一九五零年三月，张明山参加了中国共产党，在党的教育与鼓励下，增加了无限的创造勇气。他每天一边干活一边寻思，并利用午睡时间到轧钢机旁，仔细地观察钢料出口的情况；夜晚回到家里，又用破纸盒和黏土制成“反围盘”的模型，再劈一条竹板当钢坯，研究“自动化”的原理。一九五零年十一月，张明山进行了一次试验没有成功，一九五一年十月试验又失败了，部分技术人员和工人都灰了心。这时，苏联专家华西列夫给了他很大的启示和鼓舞，并建议小型厂把张明山的研究工作列入厂内的技术措施计划。在张明山把“反围盘”粗略地创制出来以后，华西列夫又帮助他设计了技术上很复杂的“扭劲”管道。经过两年零八个月的艰苦钻研，张明山终于制成了使偏圆形钢坯自动进入圆形轧孔的“反围盘”。今年九月十四日试验成功，钢坯驯服地反复穿过几个不同形状的轧孔，笔直地从成品孔钻出来。全厂职工看到这种情况，无不欢欣鼓舞，张明山被高高举起。厂长紧抱着张明山说：“老张，你给咱们小型厂解决了大问题。”
    张明山创造“反围盘”的成功，教育了许多有保守思想的技术人员和干部。工程师周仁源说：“我曾看过德国的‘钢铁手册’和美国的轧钢专家的论文，这些书籍中都没有解决这个问题。”他十分懊悔自己盲目崇拜资本主义国家的错误观点，曾在半夜里跑到厂长家里向厂长表示：“一定要改正自己的错误思想，进一步努力向苏联学习，更好地为祖国建设服务。”
    张明山创造“反围盘”成功后，鞍山市人民政府鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山市总工会联合决定，批准张明山为一九五二年鞍山特等劳动模范；并奖给人民币一千万元。中华全国总工会和东北总工会也分别致电张明山祝贺。中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局，为了把这一先进经验推广到各地轧钢厂，已派技术干部到该厂测画“反围盘”图样，进行操作技术的测定工作。（附图片）
