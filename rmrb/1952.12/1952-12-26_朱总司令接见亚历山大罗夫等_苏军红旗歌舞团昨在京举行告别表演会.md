During this period, we visited many cities, and we were warmly welcomed and treated with friendship everywhere. We believe that this love and friendship reflects the love and friendship of the Chinese people for the Soviet people. If our performances in China will help to further consolidate the friendship between our two great nations, then we will feel extremely happy. Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union – the reliable fortress of world peace!
