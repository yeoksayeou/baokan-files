    Preparing for the 1953 Work of Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen and Revolutionary Martyrs
    Central People's Government Ministry of Interior Department of Preferential Treatment
    In 1952, the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs achieved new successes on the basis of continuing to popularize and deepen patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and launching a large-scale movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen.
    In rural areas, with the development of the patriotic production increase movement, the work of organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen to participate in production and organizing farming on their behalf has been strengthened. The masses regarded doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs and farming on their behalf as an important patriotic action, and launched a farming-on-their-behalf competition simultaneously with the patriotic production increase competition. Some areas designated a portion of the land farmed on their behalf as "thousand-catty high-yield mu"; some areas regularly inspected the work of farming on their behalf during the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities; some areas launched a "Saturday Movement," mobilizing the masses to weed, accumulate fertilizer, and do odd jobs for the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen every Saturday. In particular, the combination of farming on their behalf and the mutual aid and cooperation movement is a new feature of this year's farming-on-their-behalf work. This approach enables the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen with labor or semi-labor power to participate in mutual aid labor; it enables the mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives undertaking farming on their behalf to treat the land farmed on their behalf the same as their own land, and plan comprehensively, thereby guaranteeing the yield of the land farmed on their behalf. At the same time, the method of having all the labor power in the village jointly bear the obligation of farming on their behalf and carry out work-point calculation and food distribution prevents the mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives undertaking farming on their behalf from bearing too heavy a burden. This advanced method should be vigorously promoted in the future. The method of fixed farming on their behalf has been implemented more widely than in 1951; the fertilizer problem for the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen has also been better resolved this year than last year. As a result, the yield of land farmed on their behalf this year has greatly increased compared to the past. For example, in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, the yield of land belonging to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen increased by an average of about 20 percent per mu compared to 1951, and the total yield of land farmed on their behalf in the entire prefecture increased by more than 32 million catties compared to last year. It is estimated that the yield of land farmed on their behalf in Jiangxi Province this year will increase by 10 to 15 percent compared to last year.
    In cities, due to the recovery and development of production and the development of material exchange work, factories, enterprises, or basic construction projects require a large amount of labor. All localities have given priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen when organizing employment, so the employment situation of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen this year has improved compared to 1951. For example, Fushun City introduced more than 120 families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen to work in state-owned enterprises, Wuhan City introduced 3,000 families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen to employment or organized their participation in production in eight months, and Tianjin City introduced 5,913 families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen to employment in the first ten months of 1952.
    These major achievements, coupled with other aspects of preferential treatment, have guaranteed the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Moreover, due to the increased awareness of the masses this year, the progress of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen themselves and their active participation in social activities, as well as the two major inspections of the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs carried out this spring and on the "August 1st" Army Day, and the movement to select models of preferential treatment work that began after the "August 1st" Army Day, the political status of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen has also been further enhanced.
    However, the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs must be carried out regularly and persistently, and must be constantly improved. At present, the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism have increased unabated. It unilaterally interrupted the Korean armistice negotiations and rejected the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is determined to use the method of forcibly detaining and torturing our prisoners of war to achieve its goal of undermining peace, continuing to prolong, and expanding the war. Therefore, we must further strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In its instruction issued on December 22nd, the China People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea called on everyone to conscientiously do all the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen. The people of the whole country must conscientiously improve the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs in 1953. At the same time, our country is about to begin large-scale economic construction. There are a large number of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. In some areas, the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen accounts for 10 percent of all cultivated land. In order to ensure the perfect success of the entire economic construction, especially the patriotic production increase movement in agriculture, it is also necessary to conscientiously improve the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs. Moreover, there are still some shortcomings in the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs, which must be improved in the future.
    Therefore, the people of the whole country should launch a movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs during the New Year and Spring Festival of 1953. There is much work to be done in this movement, among which the most important task is to make preparations for the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs in 1953, so as to be able to effectively do a good job in giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs.
    What preparatory work should be done? This is:
    First, conduct a thorough inspection of the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs, in order to discover problems and correct shortcomings. The main criteria for the inspection should be whether the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and disabled revolutionary soldiers are guaranteed and have been improved. In areas where the selection of models of preferential treatment has not yet been carried out, the inspection should be combined with the work of selecting models; in areas where the selection of models has been completed, the inspection should be combined with the formulation of a plan for the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs in 1953.
    Second, in rural areas, the work of farming on their behalf should be rectified and the burden of farming on their behalf should be adjusted based on the results of the inspection. According to the experience of advanced areas, this rectification work should first of all attract the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen to participate in agricultural cooperative mutual aid organizations as much as possible, in order to give play to the labor enthusiasm of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Secondly, the area of land farmed on their behalf enjoyed by the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen should be adjusted according to the principle of fairness, reasonableness, and effective resolution of problems, and the shortcomings of some areas where the area farmed on their behalf is too narrow or too wide should be corrected, because too narrow a land area will not guarantee the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, while too wide a land area will increase the burden on the masses. In addition, the number of people participating in the work of farming on their behalf should be appropriately expanded, so that farming on their behalf does not become a matter for a small number of people; but in order to facilitate cultivation, it is best to entrust fixed mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives to carry out farming on their behalf, which requires work-point calculation and accounting between the mutual aid teams, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and those who should bear the responsibility of farming on their behalf. At the same time, the unreasonable phenomenon of the disparity in the burden of farming on their behalf caused by the difference in the number of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen between regions should be adjusted. Finally, a way should be found to solve the fertilizer problem for the land farmed on their behalf as soon as possible. If these preparations are done well, the work of farming on their behalf next year can be pushed forward a step.
    Third, in cities, we should earnestly study ways to further employ the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Some cities have held employment training classes for the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, providing them with technical and political education, which not only solves the production and life problems of the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, but also helps the preparation of talents for urban economic construction. This is a long-term planning method, which is worth emulating by all localities.
    Fourth, whether the models of preferential treatment have been selected or are being selected, all regions should focus on cultivating models of preferential treatment work, in order to establish banners and become the backbone of promoting the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs in 1953.
    In carrying out these tasks, we should always pay attention to strengthening patriotic ideological education and enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses in engaging in the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs. This is the foundation for doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs.
    If we do these things well, we will definitely be able to do a better job in the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs in 1953.

    做好一九五三年优抚工作的准备
    中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    一九五二年的优抚工作，在继续普及深入抗美援朝爱国主义教育和展开大规模的拥军优属运动的基础上，获得了新的成绩。
    在农村，随着爱国增产运动的开展，组织烈属军属参加生产和组织代耕的工作都加强了。群众把做好优属代耕工作，当作一项重要的爱国行动，在展开爱国增产竞赛中同时展开了代耕竞赛。有的地区把代耕地中的一部分，订为千斤丰产亩；有的地区在“爱国检查日”活动中定期地检查代耕工作；有的地区展开了“星期六运动”，发动群众在每星期六给烈属军属铲草、积肥、做零活。特别是把代耕工作和互助合作运动相结合，是今年代耕工作中的一项新的特点。这种办法使烈军属的劳力与半劳力能够参加互助劳动；使承担代耕的互助组或农业生产合作社能将代耕土地与自己的土地同等看待，通盘计划，从而保证了代耕地的产量。同时，由于采用了全村劳力共同负担代耕义务并进行计工补粮的办法，又使承担代耕的互助组或农业生产合作社不致负担过重。这种先进的办法，是今后应该大加推广的。固定代耕的办法，较一九五一年推行更广了；烈属军属土地的肥料问题，今年也比去年解决得好。这样就使今年代耕土地的产量，较以前大大增加。如河北省邯郸专区烈属军属土地产量比一九五一年每亩平均增产百分之二十左右，全区代耕土地总产量比去年增加三千二百余万斤。江西省今年估计代耕土地产量要比去年增加百分之十至十五。
    在城市，由于生产的恢复发展和物资交流工作的开展，工厂企业或基本建设工程需要劳力甚多，各地在组织劳动就业时又优先照顾烈属军属，故今年烈属军属的就业情况，比一九五一年有进步。如抚顺市介绍了烈属军属一百二十余人参加国营企业部门工作，武汉市八个月中介绍就业及组织参加生产的烈属军属即达三千人，天津市，在一九五二年的头十个月中，介绍了烈属军属五千九百一十三人就业。
    这些主要的成绩，加上其他方面的优待，就保障了烈属军属的生活。而且，由于今年群众觉悟的提高，烈属军属本身的进步与积极参加社会活动，以及今年春季和“八一”建军节进行了两次优抚工作的大检查，“八一”建军节以后又开始了评选优抚工作模范的运动，烈属军属的政治地位也更加提高了。
    但优抚工作必须经常持久进行，并须不断地予以改进。现在，美帝国主义的侵略野心有增无已，它片面中断了朝鲜停战谈判，又拒绝了苏联代表团在联合国第七届大会上提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，一意用强迫扣留并虐杀我方战俘的办法，以达其破坏和平、继续延长和扩大战争的目的。因此，我们必须进一步加强抗美援朝工作。中国人民抗美援朝总会在十二月二十二日发出的指示中，号召大家认真做好一切拥军优属工作。全国人民必须认真把一九五三年的优抚工作提高一步。同时，我国即将开始大规模的经济建设，烈属军属的人数很多，在某些地区，烈属军属的土地，占全部耕地的百分之十，为了使整个经济建设，特别是农业爱国增产运动得到完美的成就，也必须认真把优抚工作提高一步。而且优抚工作中尚有某些缺点，也须在今后加以改进。
    因此，全国人民应该在一九五三年新年和春节期间，展开一个拥军优属的运动。在这一运动中有许多的工作要作，其中最主要的一项工作，就是做好一九五三年优抚工作的各项准备，以便能够切实把优抚工作做好。
    应该进行一些什么准备工作呢？这就是：
    第一、对优抚工作进行一次深入的检查，以便发现问题，纠正缺点。检查的主要标准，应该是烈属军属和革命残废军人的生活有无保障和已否提高。在尚未进行评选优抚模范的地区，检查应结合评选模范的工作进行；在已完成评选模范工作的地区，检查应结合订定一九五三年优抚工作计划去进行。
    第二、在农村，应根据检查的结果，整顿代耕工作，并调整代耕的负担。根据先进地区的经验，这种整顿工作，首先要尽可能吸引烈属军属参加农业合作互助的组织，以发挥烈属军属的劳动积极性。其次，要依公平合理并切实解决问题的原则，调整烈属军属享受代耕土地的面积，纠正某些地区代耕面过窄、过宽的缺点，因为过窄则使烈属军属的生活没有保障，过宽则增加群众的负担。此外，还要适当扩大群众参加代耕工作的人数，使代耕不至成为少数人的事；但为了进行耕作的方便，代耕又最好委托固定的互助组或农业生产合作社去进行，这就必须在互助组、农业生产合作社与应承担代耕人之间，进行计工与核算。同时，对于地区之间，因烈属军属多寡不同而产生的代耕负担悬殊的不合理现象，应加以调整。最后，要及早设法解决代耕土地的肥料问题。做好了这些准备工作。明年的代耕工作，就可向前推进一步。
    第三、在城市应切实研究进一步使烈属军属就业的办法。有的城市举办了烈属军属的就业训练班，授以技术和政治教育，这不但能够解决烈属军属的生产、生活问题，而且有助于城市经济建设的人材准备工作。这是一种长期打算的办法，值得各地仿效。
    第四、无论已经评选出优抚模范或正在进行评选的地区，均应着重培养优抚工作的模范，以便树立旗帜，成为推动一九五三年优抚工作的骨干。
    在进行上述这些工作时，应经常注意加强爱国主义的思想教育，提高群众从事优抚工作的积极性。这是做好优抚工作的基础。
    把这些工作做好了，我们就一定能够把一九五三年的优抚工作做得更好。
