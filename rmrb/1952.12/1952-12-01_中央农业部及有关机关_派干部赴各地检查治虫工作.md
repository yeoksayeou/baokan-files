The Central Ministry of Agriculture and Relevant Agencies
Dispatch Cadres to Various Regions to Inspect Pest Control Work

In order to thoroughly carry out the winter pest control campaign and create conditions for a bumper harvest next year, the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture recently, in conjunction with relevant agencies, dispatched cadres to rice and cotton producing areas to inspect pest control work.

    Thoroughly destroying rice roots in winter to kill overwintering rice borers has been proven to be the basic method for controlling rice borer damage. This winter is the first year of comprehensively promoting the movement to destroy rice roots. The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture and the Central People's Supervisory Committee recently issued a joint notice on timely inspection of winter rice root destruction work. Following this, the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture dispatched twenty-two cadres to East China, Central South, and other regions to organize "Winter Rice Root Destruction Inspection Teams" in conjunction with local agricultural and supervisory leading organs, to focus on inspecting and promoting this movement.

    The pest control experience in cotton-producing areas such as Hebei and Shandong provinces is: thoroughly removing weeds from fields and field edges can significantly reduce the initial damage from cotton aphids and red spiders; weeding after autumn is particularly effective. Therefore, various regions launched a vigorous autumn weeding campaign among farmers. The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture recently dispatched ten cadres, together with cadres from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and other agencies, to Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces to inspect the progress of weeding work and assist these provinces in selecting key areas to set up weeding and pest control demonstration zones.

    中央农业部及有关机关
    派干部赴各地检查治虫工作
    为了深入开展冬季治虫运动，给明年的丰收创造条件，中央人民政府农业部最近会同有关机关派出干部，分赴水稻、棉花产区检查治虫工作。
    水稻产区在冬季彻底毁灭稻根，杀死过冬螟虫，已被证明是除治螟害的基本方法。今年冬季是全面推行毁灭稻根运动的第一年，中央人民政府农业部和中央人民监察委员会在最近特地发布了关于及时检查冬季毁灭稻根工作的联合通知，接着中央人民政府农业部派出干部二十二人，分别出发到华东、中南等区，会同当地农业、监察领导机关组织“冬季毁灭稻根检查团”，有重点地检查和推动这一运动。
    棉花产区河北、山东等省的治虫经验是：彻底清除田间和田边的杂草，可以显著减轻棉蚜、红蜘蛛的初期为害；秋后除草，收效尤大。因此，各地曾在秋季发动农民大力除草。中央人民政府农业部最近派出干部十人，会同中国科学院、全国合作总社等机关的干部，出发到山西、河南、陕西等省检查除草工作进行情况，并协助各该省选择重点地区，设置除草防虫示范区。
