The Joint Decision of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on the Work of the Chinese Young Pioneers

(1) Since our first joint decision was issued in July 1950, the organization of the Chinese Young Pioneers has greatly developed. The work of the Young Pioneers has provided good assistance to school education in stimulating children's initiative in learning and helping children develop healthily, proving that the work of the Young Pioneers is an indispensable part of promoting New Democratic education to children. In the past, education administrative departments and school administrations at all levels generally attached importance to the work of the Young Pioneers. Therefore, education administrative departments and the Youth League organizations were able to cooperate closely in their work and smoothly carry out the work of the Young Pioneers. However, at present, there are still a few education administrative departments and Youth League organizations that have not clearly recognized that the work of the Young Pioneers is an integral part of national education, and therefore the cooperation is insufficient, and the work has been considerably affected. This must be corrected.

At present, with the development of national education, the work of the Young Pioneers must be further strengthened. Education administrative departments and Youth League organizations at all levels must continue to implement the joint decision of 1950 and further strengthen work contacts, so that the work of the Young Pioneers can better cooperate with national education and help complete the task of cultivating a new generation.

To this end, the Young Pioneer work departments of the Youth League committees at all levels should conscientiously study the government's education policies and the implementation plans for primary and secondary education, so that the work of the Young Pioneers can more closely cooperate with school education. At the same time, they should also frequently report the situation of the Young Pioneer work to the education administrative departments, so that the work of the Young Pioneers can further obtain administrative guidance and assistance. Local education administrative departments should take the initiative to care about and guide the work of the Young Pioneers, include the work of the local Young Pioneers in their own work plans, and specifically help solve some difficult problems. In schools, the work plan of the Young Pioneers should also obtain the consent of the school administration. The school's administrative meetings should include the chief instructor as a participant or observer, and instruct him to report regularly on the work of the Young Pioneers at administrative meetings and teacher meetings, in order to gain the understanding and help of the school administration and all teachers for the work of the Young Pioneers.

(2) Building an excellent team of instructors is the key to doing a good job in the Young Pioneers. Youth League committees at all levels should pay close attention to this matter, and with the assistance of the education administrative departments, actively, systematically, and step-by-step select and appoint sufficient and qualified primary and secondary school teachers and high school student members of the Youth League to serve as chief instructors and squadron instructors of the Young Pioneers in their units.

However, due to the lack of teachers, it is currently impossible to meet the requirement that all chief instructors be full-time (a few places with conditions can try out full-time instructors). Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately solve this problem based on the current actual situation. First, appropriately reduce the chief instructor's teaching time and other duties, so that they have the necessary time to conduct guidance work and professional studies. In general, the reduction of classes for chief instructors (including other duties, reduction of classes without reduction of salary) should be one-quarter to three-quarters. Squadron instructors must be exempted from other social work. In rural schools, where there are too few teachers and it is difficult to reduce classes, other appropriate arrangements can be made.

As for better solving the problem of reducing classes for chief instructors and gradually making chief instructors full-time, Youth League committees at all levels should have an overall plan, and according to the development of the Young Pioneers, propose the number of instructors needed currently and in the next few years, and include them in the education administrative department's plan for training and equipping teachers, in order to solve the problem in a unified manner. In addition, in order to encourage instructors to work better, their work performance in the Young Pioneers should be included as part of the teacher's attendance and performance evaluation. Excellent instructors should also be administratively commended and rewarded.

Regarding the transfer of chief instructors, there are still abnormal phenomena at present, which should also be appropriately resolved. At present, due to the rapid development of national education, it is sometimes unavoidable to transfer excellent chief instructors to take on school leadership work, which is necessary. However, in order to ensure the continuous consolidation and development of the Young Pioneers organization, Youth League committees and education administrative departments at all levels should consult with each other to achieve planned transfers, so as to retain a certain backbone, have someone continue the work, and prevent the interruption of experience. In addition, education administrative departments and Youth League organizations at all levels must also conduct instructor training work in a planned manner. The methods are as follows: (1) In normal schools, teacher training classes, and in-service teacher professional studies, knowledge about the work of the Young Pioneers should be taught as universally as possible, so that every teacher understands the work of the Young Pioneers. (2) Appropriately use holidays and vacations to hold instructor training sessions. (3) Add deputy chief instructors in larger schools. (4) Absorb outstanding squadron instructors to participate in chief instructor training sessions or other meetings as preparation for promoting chief instructors.

(3) The equipment and activity funds of the Young Pioneers in schools should be paid from the school administrative expenses. The funds for the Young Pioneers and the centralized activities of the Young Pioneers in provinces, cities, counties, and districts shall be budgeted and paid by the local Youth League organizations and education administrative departments through consultation with the education administrative departments.

### 中央人民政府教育部  中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会  关于中国少年儿童队工作的联合决定

    中央人民政府教育部
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于中国少年儿童队工作的联合决定
    （一）自一九五○年七月我们第一个联合决定发布以来，中国少年儿童队的组织已有了很大发展。少年儿童队的工作，对于启发儿童学习的自觉性和帮助儿童健全的发育，都给予学校教育很好的帮助，证明少年儿童队的工作是向儿童推行新民主主义教育不可缺少的组成部分。过去各地教育行政部门和学校行政当局对于少年儿童队的工作一般是重视的，因而教育行政部门和青年团组织在工作上能密切合作，顺利地开展了少年儿童队的工作。但目前仍有少数教育行政部门和青年团组织，还没有明确认识到少年儿童队工作是国民教育的一个组成部分，因而配合不够，工作受了相当的影响，这是必须纠正的。
    目前随着国民教育的发展，少年儿童队的工作还须进一步加强。各级教育行政部门和青年团组织必须继续贯彻一九五○年的联合决定，进一步加强工作上的联系，以便使少年儿童队的工作能够更好地配合国民教育，帮助完成培养新的一代的任务。
    为此，各级团委的少年儿童工作部门应认真地研究政府的教育政策和中、小学教育的实施计划，使少年儿童队的工作，能更紧密地配合学校教育；同时还应经常向教育行政部门反映少年儿童工作的情况，以便少年儿童队的工作能够更进一步地取得行政上的指导和帮助。各地教育行政部门则应主动地关心和指导少年儿童队的工作，要将当地少年儿童队的工作列入自己的工作计划之内，并具体地帮助解决若干困难问题。在学校中，少年儿童队的工作计划也应取得学校行政当局的同意；而学校的行政会议，则应吸收总辅导员参加或列席，并责成其在行政会议与教师会议上定期报告少年儿童队的工作，以便争取学校行政和全体教师对少年儿童队工作的了解和帮助。
    （二）建设一支优秀的辅导员队伍，是做好少年儿童队工作的主要关键。各地团委应密切注意此事，并在教育行政部门的协助下，积极而有计划、有步骤地选聘足够的和称职的中、小学教师和高中学生团员，担任本单位少年儿童队的总辅导员和中队辅导员的工作。
    但由于师资的缺乏，目前尚不可能做到总辅导员一律专职（少数有条件的地方，则可以试行专职辅导员）的要求，因而必须根据目前的实际情况，适当地解决这一问题。首先酌量减少总辅导员的授课时间与其他职务，以便他们保有必要的时间进行辅导工作与业务进修。总辅导员减课（包括其他职务，减课不减薪）一般以减四分之一到四分之三为原则。中队辅导员则必须减免其他社会工作。农村学校中教员过少，减课确有困难者，可另作适当处理。
    至于更好地解决总辅导员的减课问题，并逐步做到使总辅导员专职专任，各级团委应有通盘计划，根据少年儿童队的发展情况，提出当前以及今后几年内所需辅导员的数字，一并列入教育行政部门培养与配备师资的计划中，以便统筹解决。此外为了鼓励辅导员能更好地工作，其在少年儿童队内的工作成绩应列为教师考勤考绩内容之一。优秀的辅导员同样应该受到行政上的表扬与奖励。
    关于总辅导员的调动问题，目前仍存在着不正常现象，也应适当解决。目前由于国民教育的迅速发展，有时不可避免地调动优秀的总辅导员担任学校领导工作，这是必要的。但为了保证少年儿童队组织的不断巩固和发展，各地团委和教育行政部门应互相协商，做到有计划地调动，以便保留一定骨干，有人继续工作，经验不致中断。另外，各级教育行政部门及青年团组织还必须有计划地进行辅导员的培养训练工作，其办法如下：（1）在师范学校、师资训练班、以及在职教师的业务学习中，应尽可能普遍讲授关于少年儿童队工作的知识，使每个教师都了解少年儿童队工作。（2）适当地利用假日和假期举办辅导员讲习会。（3）在较大学校中增设副总辅导员。（4）吸收优秀的中队辅导员参加总辅导员讲习会或其他会议，作为提拔总辅导员的准备。
    （三）学校中少年儿童队的设备与活动经费应由学校行政费内开支。省、市、县、区少年儿童队和少年儿童集中活动的经费，由各地青年团组织和教育行政部门协商，在教育行政部门造具预算开支。
