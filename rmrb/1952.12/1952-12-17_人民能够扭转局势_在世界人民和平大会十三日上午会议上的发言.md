    The People Can Reverse the Situation
    —Speech at the Morning Session on December 13th of the World People's Peace Congress
    Song Qingling, Head of the Chinese Delegation
    Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates, dear friends:
    I bring to you the heartfelt congratulations of the peace-loving Chinese people. I bring to you the wishes of the Chinese people, hoping that this conference will victoriously accomplish the task of uniting all those who call for international cooperation. We have just achieved remarkable success at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and now we come here with even greater determination to join you in saving peace.
    All of us gathered here represent the vast majority of the world's people. We are entrusted by this vast majority to convene this meeting. In fact, we have come here to reverse the situation and defend peace.
    The moment we gather here can be said to be at a historical crossroads. Before us are two paths—one leading to war and destruction; the other leading to peace, progress, and a longer period, or perhaps even permanent, avoidance of war.
    History often presents mankind with such a choice. Especially in modern times, humanity has often stood at crossroads, forced to make decisions. Each time, mankind has been forced onto the path of war. Each time, it was that small handful of war-mongers who owned monopolies and profited from mass destruction who made the decision on behalf of all mankind, or rather, we should say, made the decision against the will of mankind.
    Today, as we stand at this crossroads, it is again this group of cruel and ruthless minorities within mankind who are trying to force us off the right path, as they have done in the past. However, in the current era, such decisions can no longer be monopolized by them alone without considering the wishes of the majority. Not only that, but now decisions are being made under different circumstances, because the relationship between the majority and minority forces within mankind is undergoing rapid change. The development of the world situation has brought about a fundamental shift in the balance of power between those who demand world peace and those who demand war for their own private gain. The world peace movement, with the great Soviet people standing at the forefront, has become very strong. We have reached a point in historical development where, for the first time, the majority of mankind has been able to break through all difficulties and clearly make choices based on their own interests. Now, mankind has the power to choose peace.
    The essence of this power lies in the fact that the majority of mankind has taken a clear stand to resolve the current international tensions, universally demanding the cessation of war and the resolution of all disputes through negotiation. The foundation of this power is the growing recognition that world peace can only be achieved through the courage and perseverance of the people's efforts. Every day, more and more people recognize this power, and this power is in their own hands. Every day, more and more people realize that their welfare is threatened, discover the source of this threat, see the urgency of the situation, and prepare to take action to defend peace. More and more people are joining these ranks. As a result, in many places, people are expressing deep disgust towards the monopolists who caused the suffering in Korea. In many places where the economy is controlled by war-mongers, people are protesting and expressing dissatisfaction with the increase in taxes, the reduction in food, and the lack of schools, hospitals, and housing. Currently, in many countries enslaved by others, people are rising up to fiercely fight for genuine national independence. This struggle for national independence is closely linked to the struggle to defend peace.
    Of course, we must also have an assessment of the overall situation. We know how strong the people's will for peace is. This grand conference is an accurate indicator of how broad and strong this desire for peace is. But we also know that some parts of the people's power have not yet been fully utilized, especially in some areas of the West. We also know that, although our progress is significant, there are still some important gaps in our work. Although our confidence in the final victory of peace over war is firm and unwavering, we must still take active steps to strive for this victory. We must continue our efforts, demonstrate our courage, and unite anyone who believes in negotiation rather than resorting to force to prove our sincerity.
    Therefore, we do not underestimate the power of peace, nor do we overestimate the threat of war. We see that the scope of influence of the war-mongers is shrinking. We read and hear the laments of their own spokesmen, saying that they are losing the goodwill of the world. We can see that, due to the contradictions between these allied countries regarding war policies, and due to the growing aversion to war among the people, their own disintegration and tendency towards isolation are also accelerating. But we also see that the influence of the war-mongers is still considerable. They use all kinds of propaganda tools to carry out large-scale propaganda that reverses black and white, advocating force and violence under the guise of "defending freedom and collective security." As long as this situation continues to exist, this world, you and us, and our loved ones, are still threatened by war. We must never slacken in our efforts to oppose war and defend peace. On the contrary, we must raise our efforts to new heights.
    I come from Asia. The people of Asia are suffering from the wars currently being waged on this continent, and they are actively striving to stop these wars imposed upon them and to eliminate all threats of war. The recent Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference fully demonstrated this determination and direction of effort of the 1.6 billion people in our Asian and Pacific regions.
    The people of the Middle East, Near East, and North Africa are eager to gain independence and freedom, and to use their rich resources to manage their peaceful lives. But some people want to organize aggressive war blocs in these regions and prevent them from gaining independence and autonomy.
    In Western Europe, the North Atlantic aggressive bloc is like a sinister black cloud looming over the people of countries such as Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Northern Europe, especially the people of West Germany. They have only emerged from a terrible war a few years ago, and now they are being forced to bear the heavy burden of expanding armaments and preparing for war. Needless to say, they will not succumb to this pressure. They have made courageous efforts in recent years to get rid of this pressure and seek peace, and now they are making even greater efforts.
    Peace-loving people all over the world hope that the American people will shoulder their unshirkable responsibility for this important work. I am not referring to those who have already joined the peace movement; these friends will continue to strengthen their work regardless of the pressure. I am speaking to those Americans, the majority of Americans, who yearn for peace in their hearts but have not taken any action. They have not realized that their happiness and future prospects are closely related to the American army dropping napalm bombs, indiscriminate bombing, and other criminal acts in Korea, and to the conspiracies carried out by American politicians in various parts of Europe and Asia.
    It is very likely that you are somewhat bewildered by the attitude of the rest of the world towards the United States today. You may wonder why the world's people do not thank you, but hate you instead, for the sacrifices you thought you had made. You must think that you have paid a lot of taxes, your real wages are decreasing, and your sons are being drafted into military service, all of which you think is for a just cause. But in reality, you do not know why you are doing this, and you have not really investigated, and do not know where your money is being used and how it is being used. You have not examined the true meaning of the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Mutual Security Act, and the so-called "police action" in Korea, etc. You may not know that your government leaders today have had to admit: those billions of dollars and precious lives have been completely wasted. They have only caused many disasters at home and abroad, because they do not bring the people what they need most—food, homes, and peace.
    The fact is that you have allowed the war-mongers to monopolize everything for the American people. They use your money and your sons entirely for their own purposes. They only know how to prepare for war; they spend money only to ultimately transfer it to their own pockets, which amounted to 41.8 billion US dollars in 1951. They acted recklessly, on the pretext that your way of life was threatened, when in reality the people in other parts of the world only hoped to be allowed to live their own lives. But the war-mongers exaggerated this threat, and as a result, you were deceived, and their pockets were filled. This is how those aggressive treaties, "defensive" blocs, combat divisions, and the rearmament of West Germany and Japan and the actual war in Korea came about.
    What has this developed into? As many of your important businessmen, trade union leaders, church leaders, and scholars have pointed out, it has led the United States down the path of disaster, while posing an unprecedented threat to the rest of the world. This does not mean that this threat is insurmountable; there are definitely ways to deal with it, if necessary. Its real meaning is: the political and military leaders of the United States are preparing for a great destruction, including the sweet families and loved ones of the American people themselves, and you have not tried to stop them. They are hoarding arms and materials, which are of no benefit to them, as they cannot be eaten or worn. They have alienated all the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. They cannot even get support in West Germany and Japan, because the people and youth there do not want arms or military training.
    Please note that these are all being done in your name. Recently, you elected a general to govern your country. Of course, your election is your own business. It has nothing to do with us. But please remember that this general once said that he would use Asians to fight Asians, and he probably thought that the lives of Asians were less valuable than the lives of Americans. Since the person you elected said this, and his policy is based on this idea, then it becomes our own business. He is talking about our sons and daughters. He is talking about continuing to ravage our land, resources, and culture. He is talking about continuing the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. Then you must know that the people of the Asian and Pacific regions recently unanimously demanded that these and all wars must be stopped immediately.
    The American people cannot say that they have no responsibility for this. Your votes put such a person in the highest position in your country. He is going to continue the policies of his predecessors, only in a more intensified and dangerous way.
    This conference gives the American people a best opportunity, as it does to us, to understand the problems facing humanity today and the responsibilities they should bear. We hope that it will become a driving force, awakening everyone to widely seek the truth, and arousing broad support for the delegates representing the American people who are here to participate in the peace conference. We hope that the American people will rise up to stop the war policies implemented by the American government and the actions of arbitrarily infringing upon the national independence and national rights of other peoples.
    In this struggle, which is so important to the peace movement, the American people are by no means alone. They should always remember that the struggle to defend peace is backed by the decisive majority of all mankind, and this struggle is bound to succeed. The American President Franklin Roosevelt once told the American people in a difficult time that they had nothing to fear but fear itself. This idea once inspired the people of the entire United States. Now it should be brought up again and made to function again. It should inspire the American people to rise up against the war-mongers, demand that factories be restored to peaceful production, demand that international cooperation be used as the basis of foreign policy, and resolutely refuse to engage in aggressive wars. If the American people can make such a contribution, the world will achieve peace sooner, and all countries with different political systems and ways of life will be able to coexist peacefully.
    In order to reverse the situation and defend peace, I believe that we all must actively undertake the following tasks:
    We demand the cessation of all existing wars, especially the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. The American people should demand that Eisenhower fulfill the promise he made to the American people to resolve the Korean War, a promise that contributed to his election as President of the United States. We demand that the solution be based on a ceasefire, the repatriation of all prisoners of war, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops, allowing the Korean people to solve their own problems, rather than using other troops to replace American troops in accordance with Eisenhower's vicious policy of "using Asians to fight Asians."
    We demand the cessation of all war preparations, immediate and substantial disarmament, an immediate end to the re-militarization of West Germany and Japan, and that all money and materials be used to solve the urgent needs of various countries, especially the needs of the people's welfare. Also, we demand that all parties make joint efforts to resolve all other international tensions, including the removal of barriers to international trade and cultural exchange.
    We demand the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers, which is the will of the Chinese people and the common aspiration of the people of the world; we demand that the United Nations implement the principles of the UN Charter to restore the world's people's lost confidence in the United Nations; we demand a strict ban on atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and all other weapons of mass destruction.
    We demand that no country interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor invade the territory of other countries, or exert political pressure on other countries. All relations must be based on equality.
    Dear friends, our task is already very clear. We see that we are backed by the power of hundreds of millions of people. However, there are hundreds of millions more that we need and can bring into the peace movement, because in fact peace is what they yearn for in their hearts. Many people are not speaking out now. Many people have not yet been organized. We must find ways to get them to join our movement and let them speak out. Some will fully agree with our program, some will only agree with part of it, or just one point—that the world must remain peaceful. Let us maintain close contact with everyone. We must prove to them that what we advocate will definitely be implemented. We must consult with them and jointly decide how we can best cooperate to advance the world peace movement. United, the people can reverse the situation and move towards peace.
    I come from China and know the astonishing progress our people have made in their own country once they have gained stability. So my view of a world that has gained peace is truly like heaven on earth. This is not just a wish made for our children, but something we ourselves can enjoy once we build it in our time.
    Let us advance towards peace, towards a bright new world!

    人民能够扭转局势
    ——在世界人民和平大会十三日上午会议上的发言
    中国代表团团长  宋庆龄
    主席、各位代表、亲爱的朋友们：
    我给各位带来了爱好和平的中国人民的衷心祝贺。我给各位带来了中国人民的愿望，期望这次大会胜利达成把所有要求国际合作的人们团结起来的任务。我们刚在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议取得了显著的成就，现在我们以更增强的决心，来此和你们一道，拯救和平。
    我们所有来此集会的人们，是代表着世界人民中间的极大多数。我们是受了这极大多数人的委托，来此开会的。事实上，我们来到此地，是为了扭转局势，保卫和平。
    我们在此集会的时刻，可以说是在历史上的一个三叉路口。我们面前有两条路——一条走向战争与毁灭；另一条走向和平，进步，以及一个较长时期的或者永远的避免战争的可能。
    历史常常给人类提出一个这样的选择。特别是在近代，人类常常站在两条路口，必须作出决定。每次人类都是被迫着走上了战争的道路。每次都是那一小撮拥有垄断企业、从大规模毁灭中获取暴利的战争制造者，代替整个人类作出了决定，或者我们应当说，违反了人类的意志而作出决定。
    今天，当我们站在这个三叉路口的时候，又是人类中这批残酷无情的少数，在企图像过去一样，迫使我们不走正当的道路。然而，在目前时代，这样的决定已经不是他们所能单独包办而不考虑大多数人的愿望的了。不仅止此，现在是在不同的情况下作出决定了，因为人类中多数与少数力量的关系，正在发生急速的变化。世界情势的发展，已经使要求世界和平的人与为了私利而要求战争的人之间的力量对比，发生基本的转变。有伟大的苏联人民站在最前列的世界和平运动已经非常壮大。我们已临到历史发展中的一点：这是第一次，人类中的大多数已经能够突破一切困难，明确地根据本身的利益而作出选择。现在，人类已有力量来选择和平了。
    这种力量的本质，就是人类中的大多数已采取明确的立场，来解决当前国际紧张局势，普遍要求阻止战争，并以协商方法解决一切分歧。这种力量的基础，就是人们日益认识到，只有人民拿出勇气和坚持的精神来努力追求，才能得到世界的安宁。每天有更多的人认识了这种力量，而这种力量就在他们自己手里。每天有更多的人认识到他们的福利受到了威胁，发见了这种威胁的来源，看到了情势的紧急，准备采取行动来保卫和平。参加这样行列的人越来越多了。结果，在许多地方，人民对于造成朝鲜的苦难的垄断资本家，表示深恶痛绝。许多被战争制造者控制了它的经济的地方，那里的人民对于捐税的增加，食物的减少，学校、医院与房屋的缺少，正在发出抗议，表示不满。目前，在许多被他人奴役的国家，人民起来激烈地争取真正的民族独立。这种争取民族独立的行动与保卫和平的斗争是密切联系着的。
    当然，我们对于整个情势，也必须有所估计。我们知道人民要求和平的意志是何等强大。我们这次盛大的会议，就是这个要求和平的意志如何广阔与壮大的一个准确的指标。但是我们也知道，人民力量的某些部分，现在还没有充分发挥出来，特别是在西方的若干地区。我们也知道，虽然我们的进展是很显著的，但是我们的工作还有些重要的脱节。虽然我们对于和平战胜战争的最后胜利的信心非常坚定，绝不动摇，但是我们还必须以积极行动，争取这个胜利。我们必须再接再厉，表示我们的勇气，同时团结任何相信协商而不愿诉诸武力的人，来证明我们的真诚。
    因此，我们对于和平的力量，并不估计不足，对于战争的威胁，也不估计过低，我们见到战争制造者的影响范围缩小下来了。我们读到和听到他们自己的发言人的悲鸣，说他们正在失去全世界的好感了。我们可以看到，由于这些同盟国之间关于战争政策所发生的矛盾，由于人民中间对于战争的厌恶的日益增长，他们本身的分崩离析和趋向孤立的发展过程，也加速了。但是我们也见到，战争制造者的影响还是相当大的，他们利用各种各样的宣传工具，进行大规模的颠倒黑白的宣传，在“保卫自由与集体安全”的掩饰之下鼓吹武力与强暴。只要这种情况继续存在，这个世界，你们和我们以及我们亲爱的人们，还是受着战争的威胁。我们绝不能松懈我们反对战争、保卫和平的努力。相反的，我们必须把我们的努力提到新的高度。
    我是从亚洲来的。亚洲人民正为现在正在这个大洲上进行的战争所苦，他们正在积极努力，要求停止这些强加于他们的战争和解除所有的战争的威胁。不久以前的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，就充分表现了我们亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的这种决心和努力方向。
    中东、近东和北非的人民极愿获得独立和自由，并利用他们的丰富资源来经营他们的和平生活。但是有人要在这些地区组织侵略战争集团，不许他们获得独立自治。
    在西欧，北大西洋侵略集团，正像一团凶恶的黑云笼罩着英国、法国、意大利、荷兰及北欧等国家的人民，特别是西德的人民。他们仅仅从一场可怕的大战脱离了不过几年，现在又被人把沉重的扩军备战的负担强压在他们身上。不用说，他们是不会对这种压力屈服的。他们这几年来为了摆脱这种压力，谋求和平，曾经作了勇敢的努力，现在他们正在作更大的努力。
    全世界爱好和平的人民，希望美国人民对于这一重要的工作，能担负起他们义不容辞的责任。我不是指那些已经参加和平运动的人们；这些朋友，不管压力多大，是会继续加强工作的。我是向那些美国人，大多数的美国人讲话，他们心中向往着和平，可是没有采取一点行动。他们没有认识到，他们的幸福和将来的前途，同美国军队在朝鲜投掷凝固汽油弹、狂轰滥炸以及其他罪恶行为，同美国政客们在欧亚各地所进行的阴谋活动，是有密切关联的。
    很可能，你们对于今天世界其余的人们对美国的态度，会有些惶惑。你们会奇怪，你们自以为已经作了那些牺牲，而世界人民并不感激你们，反而憎恨你们。你们一定会想，你们付了许多税，实际工资在减少下去，你们的儿子被征服兵役，这一切你们都以为是为了正当的目的。但是实际上你们并没有知道为什么要这样作，而且你们也没有真正去调查，不知道你们的钱是被用在什么地方和怎样用的。你们并没有追究马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约、共同安全法、以及在朝鲜的所谓“警察行动”等等的真实意义。你们也许不知道，你们的政府领袖今天已不得不承认：那亿万的金圆和宝贵的生命，全然白费了。它们只给你们国内和国外造成许多灾难，因为它们并不带给人民以最需要的东西——食粮、家园与和平。
    事实是这样，你们让战争制造者包办了美国人民的一切事情。他们把你们的金钱和你们的儿子完全用于他们的目的。他们只知准备战争；他们花钱只为最后转入他们自己的荷包，这数目在一九五一年达到了四百十八亿美元。他们这样胡作妄为，藉口是你们的生活方式受到了威胁，实际上世界其他地方的人们只希望能让他们过自己的生活。但是战争制造者把这种威胁说得若有其事，结果你们被骗了，而他们的荷包装满了。这样就产生了那些侵略公约、“防御”集团、作战师团以及西德和日本的重行武装和朝鲜的实际战争。
    这样已经发展到如何境地呢？正如你们许多重要的商人、工会领袖、教会领袖和学者们所指出的，它把美国带上了灾难的道路，同时对其余世界造成了空前的威胁。这并不意味着，这种威胁是无法对付的；绝对有办法对付，如果有必要的话。它真正的意义是：美国的政治、军事领袖在准备着一个大毁灭，连美国人民自己甜美的家庭和亲爱的人们都包括在内，而你们并未设法加以阻止。他们在囤积军火与物资，那对他们是绝无好处的，既不能吃，也不能穿。他们疏远了所有欧洲、亚洲、非洲、中东和拉丁美洲的人民。他们甚至在西德和日本也得不到支持，因为那里的人民和青年不要军火，也不要军事训练。
    请你们注意这些都是用了你们的名义在干着的。最近你们选出了一个将军来管理你们的国家。当然，你们的选举是你们自己的事。这与我们并不相干。但是请记着，这个将军曾经说，用亚洲人来打亚洲人，他大概认为亚洲人的生命比美国人的生命不值钱些。你们选出来的人既然这样说，而且他的政策就是以这种思想为基础，那就成了我们自己的事了。他所讲到的是我们的儿子和女儿。他讲的是要继续蹂躏我们的土地、资源和文化。他讲的是要继续在朝鲜、越南和马来亚的战争。那你们得知道，最近亚洲及太平洋区域的人民一致要求这些以及一切战争必须立即停止。
    美国人民不能说他们对此没有责任。你们的选票把这样一个人放在你们国家的最高职位上。他是要继续他前任者的政策的，只是在执行上更为加紧并采取更危险的方式。
    这次大会给美国人民以一个最好的机会，正如对于我们一样，来了解今天人类所面对的问题以及他们所应担当的责任。我们希望，它会成为一种推动力，唤起大家广泛地寻求真理，激起对于代表美国人民来这里参加和平会议的代表们，加以广泛的支持。我们希望，美国人民对于美国政府所执行的战争政策，任意侵犯别国人民的民族独立与国家权利的行动，能起来加以制止。
    在这个对于和平运动如此重要的斗争中，美国人民决不是孤独的。他们应该经常记着，保卫和平的斗争有着全人类中决定多数的人民作后盾，这个斗争是一定不会失败的。美国的总统弗兰克林·罗斯福曾经在一个艰困的时候告诉美国人民，除了恐惧本身以外，他们不用有什么恐惧。这一种思想曾经鼓舞了美国全国人民。现在应当把它再提出来，使它再一次发生作用。它应当鼓舞美国人民起来反抗战争制造者，要求把工厂恢复到和平生产，要求把国际合作作为外交政策的基础，并断然拒绝从事侵略战争。如果美国人民能作这样的贡献，世界就能更早地获得和平，而一切不同政治制度和生活方式的国家定能和平共处。
    为了扭转局势，保卫和平，我认为我们大家都要积极地担负起下列几项任务：
    我们要求停止一切现有的战争，特别是朝鲜、越南与马来亚的战争。美国人民应该要求艾森豪威尔把他向美国人民所提出解决朝鲜战争的诺言兑现，这个诺言是促成了他当选为美国总统的。我们要求，解决的方案应以停火、遣返全部战俘、撤退一切外国军队为基础，让朝鲜人民解决他们自己的问题，而不是按照艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人和亚洲人作战”的恶毒政策，利用其他军队来代替美国军队。
    我们要求停止一切的战争准备，立即地和切实地裁减军备，立即停止西德和日本的重新军国主义化，把所有金钱和物资用以解决各国的急迫需要，特别是人民福利的需要。还有，我们要求各方面以共同的努力，解除一切其他的国际紧张情况，包括撤销国际贸易和文化交流的障碍在内。
    我们要求缔结五大国的和平公约，这是中国人民的意愿，也是世界人民的共同愿望；我们要求联合国执行联合国宪章的各项原则，以恢复世界人民对于联合国已失去的信心；我们要求严格禁止原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器以及其他一切大规模毁灭人类的武器。
    我们要求一国不得干涉他国的内政，也不侵犯他国领土或对他国施用政治压力。一切关系必须以平等为基础。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们的任务已经很明确了。我们见到，我们是有着几万万人民的力量作后盾的。但是，还有几万万人是我们所需要而且能够争取到和平运动中来的，因为事实上和平正是他们心中所向往的。有许多人现在没有发言。有许多人尚未组织起来。我们必须设法使他们参加我们的运动，让他们讲出话来。他们有的会完全同意我们的纲领，有的只会同意一部分或者仅仅一点——就是世界必须保持和平。让我们和大家保持密切的接触。我们要向他们证明，我们所主张的，一定会实行。我们要和他们协商并共同决定怎样能使我们最好地合作，把世界和平运动推向前进。联合起来了，人民就能扭转局势，走向和平。
    我从中国来，知道我们的人民在自己的国土上一朝获得了安定以后，已经得到如何可惊的进步。所以我对于得到了和平的世界的看法，真正像人间出现了天堂一样。这不是仅仅对于我们儿女提出的一个愿望，而是一旦在我们的时代把它建筑起来之后，我们自己就能享受的东西。
    让我们向和平前进，走向光明的新世界！
