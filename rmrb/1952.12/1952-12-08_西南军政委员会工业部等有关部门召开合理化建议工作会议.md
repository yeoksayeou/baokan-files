    Southwest Military and Administrative Committee Industry Department and other relevant departments convened a meeting on rationalization proposals
    In order to successfully complete this year's production increase and conservation plan, the Southwest Industry Department and other relevant departments specially convened a joint meeting on rationalization proposals in mid-November. The meeting exchanged experiences in carrying out the rationalization proposal movement and decided to immediately correct the shortcomings existing in the movement, so that the rationalization proposal movement in all factories and mines would be seriously carried out. The meeting decided that each factory and mine should immediately improve the review mechanism for rationalization proposals, establish organizations related to technological inventions, and be specifically responsible for the implementation, improvement, and promotion of proposals; concentrate efforts to first solve key problems in production; summarize experiences, and make rationalization proposals advanced experiences or technical operating procedures; handle, review, and award prizes conscientiously, resolutely implement those that are adopted, and respond to those that are not adopted. In recent months, employees of various factories and mines have put forward more than 20,000 rationalization proposals, three times more than the total rationalization proposals in 1951. These proposals have helped solve some key problems existing in various factories and mines, greatly promoting production reform work, and significantly improving output and quality. For example, the proposal of the double-steel feeding method of feeding two steel bars at the same time when rolling steel rails at the 101 Steel Plant has doubled the output of steel rails.

    西南军政委员会工业部等有关部门召开合理化建议工作会议
    为了胜利地完成今年的增产节约计划，西南工业部等有关部门特在十一月中旬联合召开了合理化建议工作会议。会议交流了开展合理化建议运动的经验，决定立刻纠正运动中存在的缺点，使所有工厂矿山的合理化建议运动认真开展起来。会议决定：各工厂矿山要立刻健全合理化建议的审查机构，建立有关技术发明的组织，专门负责建议的实施、提高和推广等工作；要集中力量先解决生产中的关键性问题；总结经验，使合理化建议成为先进经验或技术操作规程；要认真处理、审查、给奖，采纳的坚决实施，不采纳的也给以答复。几个月来，各厂矿职工群众提出的合理化建议达两万多件，比一九五一年全年的合理化建议还多三倍。这些建议帮助解决了各厂矿存在的一些关键性问题，使生产改革工作大大推进了一步，产量和质量都有显著提高。如一零一钢铁厂轧钢轨时同时喂进两根钢条的双钢喂钢法的提出，就使钢轨产量提高一倍。
