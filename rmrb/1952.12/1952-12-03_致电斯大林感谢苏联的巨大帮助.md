(Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 2nd) The entire staff of the steelmaking plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who, with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, set a new record in open-hearth steelmaking, sent a telegram to Stalin on the 2nd to thank the Soviet Union for its great assistance in the construction of China's steel industry. The telegram reads as follows:

Respectable Comrade Stalin:

Please allow us first of all to express our heartfelt gratitude to you. With the enthusiastic and selfless help of steelmaking experts such as Ninasiev, Tsrenko, and Makarov, dispatched by you with superb technology, our open-hearth furnace created a new national record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and nine minutes on November 22nd. The smelting time of this new record has been shortened by four hours and three minutes compared with the average smelting time of each open-hearth furnace in our factory in October; the furnace bottom area utilization coefficient has been increased to 11.08 tons of steel; and the quality of the steel is fully up to standard. We would like to offer this achievement as a gift to you during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."

In the past four years, we have deeply realized from practical experience that the Soviet socialist science and technology armed with Marxism-Leninism is the most advanced and creative science and technology in the world; at the same time, we have also realized that only Soviet experts with a great spirit of internationalism are willing to sincerely and selflessly help us build our own country. In order to accelerate the construction of our country's industry and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world together with the Soviet people, we have launched a movement to learn from the Soviet Union and from Soviet experts. We are conscientiously implementing the new technical operating procedures personally helped by Soviet experts, and strive to complete the production tasks assigned to us by the state this year twenty days ahead of schedule on December 10th.

We wish you good health!

The entire staff of the State-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant, People's Republic of China

(Signed)
