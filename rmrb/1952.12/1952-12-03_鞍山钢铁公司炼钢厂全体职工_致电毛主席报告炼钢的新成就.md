Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 2nd:

    All employees of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on the 2nd to report the good news of their creation of a new national steelmaking record on November 22nd with the help of Soviet experts. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," which further consolidates and develops the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we report to you and the Party Central Committee a major victory from our steelmaking plant: On November 22nd, our open-hearth furnace set a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and nine minutes. The smelting time of our new record is four hours and three minutes shorter than the average smelting time of each open-hearth furnace in October; the steelmaking efficiency has been increased to 11.08 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom area; and the quality of the steel fully meets the specifications. This is a major achievement we have achieved with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts. Looking back four years ago, when this steelmaking plant was taken over by the people, the steelmaking equipment was dilapidated and the steel production efficiency was very low. Taking the steelmaking situation in 1950 as an example, the average time for smelting a furnace of steel at that time was 11 hours and 8 minutes; and only 4.67 tons of steel were produced per square meter of furnace bottom area. In the four years since then, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the enthusiastic and selfless help of Soviet experts, our steelmaking plant has not only completely restored the original equipment, but also unprecedentedly increased the output and quality of steel. If the steel output in 1949 is taken as 100 percent, it reached 500 percent in 1950; in 1951, when all the equipment was running throughout the year, the steel production reached the highest annual level during the puppet Manchurian rule; in 1952, the steel output exceeded the highest annual level during the puppet Manchurian rule by 33 percent. If all the open-hearth furnaces in our plant can catch up with the steelmaking level achieved by this new record, the steel output of our plant will be rapidly increased. In order to produce more and better steel for the motherland to accelerate the progress of basic construction and to industrialize the motherland as soon as possible, we launched a production competition as early as November 10th. We are determined to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and guarantee to report to you and the Party Central Committee once again on December 10th with the practical action of completing the state's production tasks for us this year 20 days ahead of schedule.
    We wish you good health! And extend to you and the Party Central Committee
    Our highest respect
    All employees of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant
    December 2nd

    致电毛主席报告炼钢的新成就
    【新华社鞍山二日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂全体职工在二日致电毛主席报告他们在苏联专家帮助下于十一月二十二日创造炼钢全国新纪录的喜讯。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在更进一步巩固和发展中苏伟大友谊的“中苏友好月”里，我们向您和党中央报告我们炼钢厂一个重大的胜利消息——十一月二十二日，我们的炼钢平炉又创造了以六小时零九分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。我们这次新纪录的炼钢时间，已比十月份各个平炉的平均炼钢时间缩短了四小时零三分钟；炼钢效率已提高到每一平方公尺炉底面积出十一点零八吨钢；钢的质量完全合乎规格。这是我们炼钢厂在苏联专家的热诚帮助下所获得的一个重大成就。回想四年前当这个炼钢厂为人民接收过来时，炼钢设备还是破烂不堪的，钢的生产效率也是非常低的。拿一九五○年的炼钢情况来说，那时每炼一炉钢的平均时间是十一小时零八分钟；每一平方公尺炉底面积只出四点六七吨钢。四年以来，我们的炼钢厂，在中国共产党领导下，在苏联专家热诚无私地帮助下，我们的炼钢厂不但把原来的设备完全恢复了，而且空前地提高了钢的产量和质量。钢的产量如果以一九四九年为百分之百，则一九五○年达到了百分之五百；全部设备全年开动的一九五一年，钢的生产已达到伪满统治时期的最高年度的水平；一九五二年，钢的产量就超过了伪满统治时期最高年度的百分之三十三。如果我们全厂各个平炉都能赶上这次新纪录所达到的炼钢水平，我们厂的钢的产量就会迅速地提高起来。为了给祖国生产更多更好的钢铁以加速基本建设的进行，使祖国早日工业化，我们早在十一月十日就展开了生产竞赛，我们决心认真地贯彻实行苏联专家的建议，保证在十二月十日以提前二十天完成国家给予我们今年生产任务的实际行动，再一次地向您和党中央报捷。
    谨祝您身体健康！并向您和党中央致以
    崇高的敬礼
    国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂全体职工
    十二月二日
