A short commentary on economic life:

    Vigorously Develop Rural Credit Cooperatives

    Developing rural credit cooperatives is an effective way to gather idle funds from the people, promote agricultural production, and combat usury. Since the liberation of all China, we have advocated and implemented a policy of free lending. The policy of free lending has played and will continue to play a significant role in stimulating the rural economy and solving the urgent needs of farmers. However, because our national banking institutions have not yet penetrated into the countryside and lack proper guidance for rural free lending, usury has re-emerged in some areas, damaging agricultural production and bankrupting some impoverished farmers. To protect the interests of farmers, we must resolutely combat usury with effective measures.

    The effective measures to combat rural usury, in addition to the state bank providing agricultural loans according to plan and local governments imposing necessary restrictions on the interest rates of free lending, the most important method is to organize credit cooperatives to pool the surplus funds of the masses to solve the difficulties of the masses in production and life. This will also powerfully guide the free lending among farmers and make it develop normally. Facts have proved that in areas where credit cooperatives have been organized, usury will be greatly reduced or eliminated, and rural credit work will tend to be normal.

    The rural mutual aid and cooperation movement should include production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation, but at present, credit cooperation is too weak. The weakness of credit cooperation will also affect the development of production cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation. Party and government leading organs at all levels should pay attention to this work and strengthen their leadership over credit cooperation in order to comprehensively develop rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations and guide farmers towards collectivization.

    大力发展农村信用合作社
    开展农村信用合作事业，是聚集民间闲散资金，推进农业生产，打击高利贷的有效办法。全中国解放以后，我们是提倡和实行自由借贷政策的。自由借贷政策在活跃农民经济，解决农民迫切需要方面，曾经并将继续发挥重大的作用。但是，由于我们国家银行机构还未深入到农村当中，对农村的自由借贷还缺乏应有的领导，因此，高利贷又在若干地区发展起来，破坏农业生产，使某些贫困的农民陷于破产。为了维护农民利益，我们必须以有效办法，坚决地打击高利贷。
    打击农村高利贷的有效办法，除国家银行按计划进行农业贷款、各地政府对自由借贷的利息加以必要的限制外，最重要的方法就是组织信用合作社，把群众的剩余资金组织起来，解决群众生产和生活的困难。这样也就有力地领导了农民间的自由借贷，使其正常发展。事实证明：凡是组织了信用合作社的地区，高利贷就会大大减少或者绝迹，农村信用工作就趋向正常。
    农村的互助合作运动应该包括生产合作、供销合作、信用合作三个方面，但目前信用合作是太薄弱了。信用合作薄弱，也会影响生产合作与供销合作的发展。各地党政领导机关应该重视这一工作，加强对信用合作的领导，以便全面地发展农村互助合作组织，引导农民走向集体化。
