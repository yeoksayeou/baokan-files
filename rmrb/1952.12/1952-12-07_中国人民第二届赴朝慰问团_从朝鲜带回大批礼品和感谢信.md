Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: The Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea brought back a large number of letters of gratitude written to Chairman Mao Zedong and all the Chinese people by the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people. In these letters, the Chinese People's Volunteers, to thank the people of the motherland for their condolences, expressed their determination to resist America and aid Korea to defend the construction of the motherland; the Korean People's Army and the Korean people expressed their heartfelt gratitude for China's condolences. Among the more than 30,000 letters of gratitude, more than 3,000 were specifically written to Chairman Mao.

The entire command and combat personnel of an anti-aircraft artillery battalion of a certain unit of the Volunteers, which was awarded the collective Second Class Merit, reported in their letter to Chairman Mao that the unit had achieved the brilliant record of shooting down and damaging 203 enemy aircraft in a year and a half. They then expressed their determination, saying: "We are determined not to be arrogant or impetuous, but to continue our efforts, maintain our glory, promote our glory, study technology, summarize experience, and strive to shoot down more enemy aircraft and make greater contributions to the motherland and the Korean people, in order to defend the construction of the motherland and world peace."

The entire group of heroes of a detachment of a certain unit of the Volunteers wrote to Ma Hengchang, a national model worker in industry, congratulating the motherland on the brilliant achievements it has made in the past three years, and wrote: "In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, thanks to the leadership of millions of model workers like you across the country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, a climax of finding tricks and increasing production for the country has been set off everywhere, which has increased a large amount of national wealth, and this is inseparable from your contribution. Your noble working-class qualities of loving the motherland and the people, actively producing, and increasing production for the country are a model for us to learn from. We must establish the idea of resisting America and aiding Korea for a long time, severely attack the invaders, and protect you to better build our great motherland."

Volunteer soldier Chen Bin wrote to Qu Yaoli, a national model worker in cotton production: "From the sound waves across the distant Yalu River, we are very excited to know that you have created a new record of high yield in your busy construction posts. With your strong support and encouragement, we have achieved great victories in the front lines in the past two years. But we will never be satisfied with this and will resolutely fight on to win greater victories. I hope that you will work hard in the rear and create new records again."

Volunteer soldier Li Peicai wrote to Qi Jianhua, the creator of the quick literacy method: "In the past, because I had no culture, I felt difficulty in whatever work I did. Since the higher authorities called for a cultural university study, I thought that I could improve my culture this time. The higher authorities said at the mobilization meeting that there was a quick literacy method created by Comrade Qi Jianhua, which could learn three or four hundred characters a day. I didn't quite believe it. I felt that I hadn't learned two thousand characters after three or four years of schooling in the past. How could it be so fast now? The higher authorities said that as long as you are determined, you can guarantee to learn well. Since the first day, I have learned phonetic symbols, and I have not fallen behind in spelling and intensive new words. In less than a month, I have read all the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of Chinese language, and I also know more than two thousand new characters. These achievements are due to your creation of the quick literacy method, and we should thank you."

Huang Jinlin of a certain unit of the Volunteers said firmly in his letter to the people of the motherland: "With your support, as long as we are closely linked together, victory will always belong to us. Give full play to your strength in your posts, and we are willing to hear the good news of your increased production again at the front. At the same time, you see, the victory at the front will surely satisfy your hopes. Let us together fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the motherland and the people of the world!"

The People's Army and the Korean people also entrusted the delegation to bring back a large number of letters of gratitude to the Chinese people. The eighth sub-delegation of the delegation received 2,000 letters of gratitude from a certain unit at one time. Zhao Zhenxing, a young soldier of the People's Army, said in his letter of gratitude to the Chinese people: "We Korean youths are standing with the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, that is, your best brothers - the Chinese People's Volunteers - on the fierce battlefield fighting to defeat our common enemy - the aggression of American imperialism. Now we are able to welcome the delegation sent by you and all the Chinese people, which is our greatest glory. The delegation has brought us infinite strength and further consolidated our confidence in victory. We often think of our neighboring country, the great China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, where there are invincible forces of thousands of young people supporting us, and the entire peace camp is constantly growing, and our confidence in victory is even more consolidated. We guarantee to repay the Chinese people for their assistance with more victories. I wish Chairman Mao good health forever."

    志愿军某部荣立集体二等功的高射炮营的全体指挥员、战斗员给毛主席的信，首先报告了该部在一年半中获得击落击伤敌机二百零三架的辉煌战绩，接着表示决心说：“我们坚决不骄不躁，再接再厉，保持光荣，发扬光荣，钻研技术，总结经验，争取打落更多的敌机，为祖国和朝鲜人民立下更大的功绩，以保卫祖国建设和世界和平。”
    志愿军某部一分队全体功臣给全国工业劳动模范马恒昌的信，在祝贺祖国三年来所获得的光辉成就后写道：“在增产节约运动中，由于全国像你这样的千万劳动模范的带头，在毛主席的英明领导下，到处掀起找窍门，为国家增产的高潮，增加了国家大量财富，这是和你的功劳分不开的。你这种爱祖国、爱人民的积极生产，为国家增产的高贵的工人阶级品质，是我们学习的榜样。我们一定树立长期抗美援朝的思想，严重地打击侵略者，保卫着你们更好地建设我们伟大的祖国。”
    志愿军战士陈斌给全国棉花丰产模范曲耀离的信上写道：“从遥远的鸭绿江彼岸的声波中，我们很兴奋地知道，在紧张建设岗位上的你们创造了丰产的新纪录。在你们大力支援与鼓舞下，二年来我们在前方取得了巨大的胜利。但我们决不以此满足，一定坚决战斗下去，以争取更大的胜利。希望你在后方努力生产，再一次创造新纪录。”
    志愿军某部战士李佩才写给速成识字法的创造者祁建华的信上说：“我过去因为没有文化，不管做什么工作，都感觉到困难。自从上级号召文化大学习，我就想这回可把我的文化提高了。上级在动员大会上说，有祁建华同志创造的速成识字法，一天能学三四百字，我就有些不大相信，感觉过去上三四年学，还学不会两千字，现在那有这么快的呢？上级说，只要有决心，保证能学好。自从第一天开始，我就学会了注音符号，一直到拼音，突击生字，我都没有掉队，不到一个月的时间，我就把一、二、三、四册国文都念下来，两千多生字也都认识了。这些成绩都是有你创造了速成识字法得来的，我们对你应当感谢。”

    人民军和朝鲜人民也托慰问团给中国人民带回大批感谢信，仅慰问团第八分团在某部一次就收到感谢信两千封。人民军青年战士赵镇兴给中国人民的感谢信上说：“我们朝鲜青年是与中国人民的优秀儿女也就是你们最好的弟兄——中国人民志愿军站在为打击我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义的侵略而进行斗争的激烈的战场上，现在又能够迎接你们和全中国人民派来的慰问团，这是我们的最大光荣。慰问团给我们带来了无限的力量，更加巩固了我们胜利信心。我们经常想起我们的邻邦是毛主席领导下的伟大的中国，那里有千千万万热血青年们的不可战胜的力量在支援我们，整个的和平阵营也在不断壮大，我们的胜利信心就更加巩固了。我们保证将以更多的胜利来报答中国人民对我们的援助。祝毛主席永远健康。”
