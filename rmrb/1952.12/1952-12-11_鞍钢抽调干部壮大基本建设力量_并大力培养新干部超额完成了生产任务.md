    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Transfers Cadres to Strengthen Capital Construction
    And Vigorously Trains New Cadres, Exceeding Production Targets
    [This Newspaper News] The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Anshan Iron and Steel) successfully implemented the policy of transferring cadres from production departments to strengthen capital construction departments, which played a significant role in completing Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction tasks this year; at the same time, the production departments were not affected by the transfer of cadres, but also cultivated and promoted a large number of new cadres, exceeding production targets and constantly creating new records.
    The task of capital construction at Anshan Iron and Steel is unprecedentedly huge and complex. This year, the workload of capital construction at Anshan Iron and Steel is 8.8 times greater than the actual workload completed last year. Anshan Iron and Steel has four major projects. In one major project alone, more than 48,000 cubic meters of concrete need to be poured. In this 48,000-plus cubic meter concrete project, thousands of foundation bolts must be installed without any error of even one millimeter; at the same time, more than 87,000 meters of cable pipes and sanitary pipes must be installed in an orderly manner, and more than 20,000 tons of mechanical equipment and metal structures must be accurately installed. Constructing such a concrete project is by no means as simple as constructing ordinary factories and houses. To do such a project well, it is necessary to establish various specialized institutions and equip them with a large number of personnel. Therefore, Anshan Iron and Steel established six specialized institutions, including civil construction, mechanical installation, metal structure, sanitary equipment installation, electrical installation, and furnace installation, as well as thirteen processing factories. The six specialized institutions have a total of 56 engineering teams, of which more than 800 people with high technical skills are needed to specialize in installing foundation bolts and machines. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel's design drawings weigh more than twelve tons, so a strong design force is also necessary. At the same time, in such a large-scale capital construction project, a large number of personnel are also needed to be responsible for transporting materials, equipment, and apparatus. After the "Three-Anti" movement, Anshan Iron and Steel only had 41 cadres at the section chief and team leader level in the capital construction department, which was obviously not in line with the requirements of capital construction. Therefore, from March of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel began to resolutely transfer a large number of cadres from the production departments to the capital construction departments. As of now, a total of 364 administrative cadres (including 21 major leading cadres above the division chief level, accounting for 30% of the original major leading cadres; 90 section chief and team leader level cadres, accounting for 14.9% of the original number), 210 engineering and technical personnel, and a large number of cadres and skilled workers engaged in Party and mass work have been transferred from the production departments to the capital construction departments. Anshan Iron and Steel now has eight managers, four of whom are specifically responsible for capital construction work. Due to such a large number of cadres being transferred from the production departments to the capital construction departments, the capital construction institutions have gradually been strengthened. Now, Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction institutions have become relatively complete and powerful institutions. Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction department has established twelve sections, including geology, design, planning, materials, equipment, finance, engineering management, labor and wages, organization, security, publicity and education, and secretarial. Among them, the design section has more than 1,000 people; the design section has established ten design units, including civil construction, water conservancy, equipment, electrical, power, chemical, mineral processing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling, as well as two administrative and planning units. This enables Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction institutions to adapt to the requirements of the task.
    Anshan Iron and Steel encountered some obstacles in the process of transferring cadres. In March of this year, when the leadership was preparing to transfer cadres, individual leading cadres believed that Anshan Iron and Steel's production was very important, and that Anshan Iron and Steel's leading backbone and technical personnel were already very scarce. If a large number of cadres were to be transferred, it would inevitably hinder production. Some cadres thought, "I have already figured out some ways in production, and now I have to go to the capital construction department and start learning from scratch." In order to resolutely implement the policy of transferring cadres from the production departments, the leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel promptly paid attention to the ideological situation of the cadres and conducted ideological education to eliminate the ideological concerns of the cadres. Therefore, cadres were successfully transferred from the production departments, and the strength of capital construction was rapidly strengthened.
    In the past eight months, after the production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel transferred cadres, not only were they able to continue production work as usual, but they also cultivated and promoted a new batch of cadres. As a result, they exceeded production targets and constantly created new records. Since the "Three-Anti" movement alone, the production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel have cultivated and promoted 744 administrative cadres above the workshop director level. If the grassroots cadres of the Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League who were promoted at the same time are included, the total number is close to 2,000. At the same time, more than 200 technical personnel have been newly promoted, which has basically made up for the number of technical personnel transferred to the capital construction departments. At present, each leadership position at all levels in the production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel is equipped with one chief and two deputies, or one chief and three deputies. Soon, all of them will be equipped with one chief and three deputies, so that cadres can be transferred at any time when the state needs them. Since the transfer of cadres, the production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel have consistently completed their production tasks well. For example, calculated according to the total output value, Anshan Iron and Steel exceeded the production plan by 11.7% in the second quarter of this year; and exceeded the production plan by 5.1% in the third quarter. On November 22, the No. 4 open hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Steelmaking Plant brilliantly created a national record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and nine minutes. In the historical great transformation of China's industrial construction, Anshan Iron and Steel has set a model example for state-owned factories and mines across the country in transferring cadres. The facts of Anshan Iron and Steel powerfully prove that transferring cadres from production departments to strengthen capital construction will not ruin production.

    鞍钢抽调干部壮大基本建设力量
    并大力培养新干部超额完成了生产任务
    【本报讯】国营鞍山钢铁公司（以下简称鞍钢）成功地执行了从生产部门抽调干部充实基本建设部门的方针，壮大了基本建设的力量，对于完成今年鞍钢基本建设任务起了很大的作用；同时生产部门不仅没有因为抽调干部而受到影响，还培养和提拔了大批新干部，超额完成了生产任务，不断地创造了新纪录。
    鞍钢基本建设的任务是空前巨大而复杂的。今年鞍钢基本建设的工作量就比去年实际完成的工作量大八点八倍。鞍钢有四大项主要工程。其中一个主要工程，仅浇灌混凝土就有四万八千多立方公尺。在这个四万八千多立方公尺混凝土工程中，要安好几千个地脚螺丝，不能发生一公厘的差错；同时要把八万七千多公尺长的电缆管道、卫生管道，有条不紊地安好，还要准确地安装起二万多吨重的机电设备和金属结构。修建这样的混凝土工程，决不像修建普通的厂房和房屋那样简单。做好这样的工程，就必须要求成立各种专门化的机构，配备大量的人员。因之鞍钢成立了土木建筑、机械安装、金属结构、卫生设备安装、电气安装和装炉等六个专门机构和十三个加工工厂。六个专门机构共有五十六个工程队，其中专门安装地脚螺丝和机器的，就需要八百多个具有高度技术水平的人员。今年鞍钢的设计图纸的重量有十二吨多，因之，也必须要有强大的设计力量。同时在这样大规模基本建设工作中，也需要大批负责运输材料、设备和器材的人员。而鞍钢在“三反”运动后，基本建设部门中只有科长、队长以上的干部四十一人，显然不能符合于基本建设的要求。因此，鞍钢从今年三月起，就开始果断地从生产部门抽调了大量的干部，输送到基本建设部门。截至目前为止，先后从生产部门抽调到基本建设部门的已有三百六十四名行政干部（其中包括处长以上的主要领导干部二十一人，占原有主要领导干部的百分之三十；科长、队长级干部九十人，占原有人数的百分之十四点九），二百一十名工程技术人员和大批作党与群众工作的干部与技术工人。鞍钢现有八个经理，其中就有四个经理专门负责基本建设工作。由于这样大量地从生产部门抽调干部到基本建设部门，基本建设的机构才逐渐充实起来，现在鞍钢的基本建设机构已成为较完整的强大的机构。鞍钢基本建设部门已成立了地质、设计、计划、材料、设备、财务、工程管理、劳动工资、组织、保卫、宣教和秘书等十二个处。其中设计处有一千多人；在设计处设立了土木建筑、水利、设备、电气、动力、化工、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等十个设计单位和两个行政、计划单位。这样就使鞍钢基本建设机构，能够适应于任务的要求。
    鞍钢在抽调干部过程中，曾碰到一些障碍。在今年三月，领导方面准备抽调干部时，个别领导干部认为鞍钢的生产很重要，鞍钢的领导骨干和技术人员本来就很缺乏，如果又要抽出大批干部，势必会妨碍生产。有些干部认为：“在生产方面已经摸到了一些门道，现在又要到基本建设部门去，又要从头学习。”鞍钢领导方面为了果断地执行从生产部门抽调干部的方针，及时注意了干部的思想情况，并进行了思想教育，解除了干部中的思想顾虑。因而成功地从生产部门抽出了干部，迅速地加强了基本建设的力量。
    八个月来，鞍钢生产部门在调出干部之后，不仅能照常进行生产工作，而且又培养和提拔了一批新的干部，结果超额完成了生产任务并不断创造了新纪录。仅在“三反”运动以后，鞍钢生产部门就培养和提拔了车间主任以上的行政干部七百四十四名，若连同时提拔的党、工会、青年团的基层干部计算在内，总数已近二千名。同时，还新提拔了技术人员二百多人，已基本上补足了输送到基本建设部门去的技术人员的数额。目前，鞍钢生产部门的各级领导岗位上，都配备了一个正职和两个副职或一个正职和三个副职的干部，不久，并将全部配备上一个正职和三个副职的干部，以便国家需要干部时能够随时抽调出来。从抽出干部之后，鞍钢生产部门始终很好地完成了生产任务。如按照生产总值计算，鞍钢今年第二季度超额完成了生产计划百分之十一点七；第三季度又超额完成生产计划百分之五点一。鞍钢炼钢厂四号平炉在十一月二十二日又出色地创造了六小时零九分钟炼一炉钢的全国纪录。鞍钢在我国工业建设的历史性的大转变中，已经为全国国营厂矿作出抽调干部的模范榜样。鞍钢的事实，有力地证明了从生产部门抽调干部充实基本建设力量是不会把生产搞垮的。
