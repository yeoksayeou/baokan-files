To further consolidate and develop the construction of democratic political power, Shandong and Fujian provinces recently convened their first provincial county head conferences. The main topic of the meetings was the construction of people's democratic political power. The first county head conference in Shandong Province began on November 20 and closed on December 7. The conference summarized the achievements of Shandong Province in democratic political construction over the past three years: people's representative conferences have been established in all four province-administered cities, seven special district-administered cities, 118 counties, one special zone, and one administrative office. In the past three years, a total of 1,085 people's representative conferences have been held. The most frequent areas have held ten sessions, and the least frequent have held six. The people's representative conferences in eight cities, including Jinan and Qingdao, and nineteen counties, including Kunyu, Muping, and Licheng, have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress. In cities with a population of more than 100,000, district people's representative conferences have been established in 18 districts. 12,243 townships across the province have convened township people's representative conferences, exercising the functions and powers of the township people's congress and establishing township people's governments, accounting for more than 85 percent of the total number of townships planned. All eleven city consultative committees in the province have been equipped with full-time cadres and have established regular work. Sixty percent of the county standing committees have also been equipped with full-time cadres and have initially established working systems. The work of democratic political construction has played a significant role in promoting all aspects of work in the province. This county head conference summarized the typical experiences of the province in the construction of people's democratic political power and the exercise of the functions and powers of the people's representative conferences over the past three years, further consolidated the establishment of democratic thought, unified the understanding of the work of democratic political construction, and laid a solid foundation for the exercise of the functions and powers of the people's congress by the people's representative conferences in all counties and cities of the province, as well as the work of democratic township construction.

The conference first discussed the report by Xiang Ming, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, on "Further Strengthening the Construction of People's Democratic Political Power," and listened to and studied reports on typical experiences from various regions. After repeated discussions in groups and at the general assembly, everyone unanimously recognized that the people's representative conference is the basic system of our country, and only by holding the people's representative conference well can we better unite the broad masses of the people and ensure the victorious completion of construction tasks. During the discussion, some erroneous ideas that hindered the further consolidation and development of the people's democratic dictatorship, such as the so-called "too busy with work," "insufficient preparation," and "representative conferences are not as effective as cadre meetings in solving problems," were exposed and criticized. The conference summarized the experience of holding county and city people's representative conferences well. These experiences are: 1. Leaders should attach importance to educating cadres to firmly establish democratic thinking and style. 2. Closely integrate with the central work, solve the problems that the masses urgently demand to solve at present, and unite and educate the broad masses of the people to improve their sense of being masters of the country and managing political power, so as to overcome difficulties and complete various work tasks. 3. Give full play to democracy, and all major issues should be repeatedly consulted, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out. 4. Connect the county people's representative conference with the township people's representative conference, effectively grasp that the county is an important link and the township is the foundation in the current political construction work, hold the township people's representative conference at the same time as the county people's representative conference, and give play to the role of the county and township people's government committees, the county standing committees, and the various township work committees.

The conference then discussed the report by Wang Zhuoru, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Provincial People's Government, on "The Current Basic Situation in Rural Areas and Future Tasks." Everyone further clearly realized that the only way to make the lives of farmers prosperous is to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. This winter and next spring, the central task in rural areas must be winter production, summing up the experience of the bumper harvest movement, formulating the 1953 agricultural production plan, and consolidating, improving, and developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Other various tasks should be carried out around this central task. During the conference, Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, came to guide and made a report on the construction of people's democratic political power to the conference, which gave great encouragement and enlightenment to the participants.

The first county head conference in Fujian Province started on October 7 and ended on the 11th of the same month. The conference criticized the erroneous ideas that currently hinder the work of political power construction. Some cadres believed that "promoting work mainly relies on cadre meetings, work teams, and the use of mass organizations." These erroneous views confused the nature of the people's representative conference and the cadre meeting, and confused the nature of the political power organization and the mass organization, which made it impossible for the people's representative conference to develop into an organ for the local people to exercise state power. After discussion and criticism, the participants unanimously recognized that political democratization and national industrialization are inseparable, and the further strengthening of county and city people's representative conferences can further improve the people's sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for economic construction; the further democratization of state power will enable the political power to play a greater role in leading and ensuring economic construction. At the end of the meeting, Zhang Dingcheng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, made a concluding report. After summarizing the achievements of Fujian Province in democratic political construction over the past three years, he emphasized that improving democratic thinking and developing a democratic style are important keys to promoting the work of democratic political construction; and that everything starts from the interests of the people, believing in the wisdom and creativity of the people is the source of democratic thinking. Chairman Zhang Dingcheng made clear instructions on the combination of democratic political construction and the current central tasks and other work. According to Chairman Zhang Dingcheng's summary, the conference made a resolution to further promote the work of democratic political construction.

    为进一步巩固和发展民主政权建设工作
    山东福建两省召开首次县长会议
    山东、福建两省最近先后举行了第一次全省县长会议。会议均以人民民主政权建设工作为主要议题。山东省第一次县长会议开始于十一月二十日，至十二月七日闭幕。会议总结了三年来山东省民主建政工作的成绩：全省四个省辖市、七个专署辖市、一百一十八个县、一个特区、一个办事处，均已建立了各界人民代表会议。三年来，共开人民代表会议一千零八十五次。最多的地区开过十次，最少的也开过六次。济南、青岛等八市，昆嵛、牟平、历城等十九个县的各界人民代表会议已代行了人民代表大会职权。十万人口以上的城市中，已有十八个区建立了区人民代表会议。全省有一万二千二百四十三个乡召开了乡人民代表会议，代行了乡人民代表大会职权，建立了乡人民政府，占划乡总数的百分之八十五以上。全省十一个市协商委员会均已配备专职干部，建立了经常工作。百分之六十的县常务委员会也已配备专职干部，初步建立了工作制度。民主建政工作，对全省的各项工作起了重大的推动作用。这次县长会议总结了本省三年来人民民主政权建设工作和人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的典型经验，进一步巩固地树立了民主思想，统一了对民主建政工作的认识，为全省各县、市人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权以及民主建乡工作打下了巩固的基础。
    会议首先讨论了省人民政府向明副主席关于“进一步加强人民民主政权建设工作”的报告，并听取和研究了各地典型经验的报告。经过小组和大会的反复讨论，大家一致认识到人民代表会议是我们国家的基本制度，只有开好人民代表会议，才能更好地团结广大人民，保证建设任务的胜利完成。在讨论中，对妨碍进一步巩固和发展人民民主专政工作的若干错误思想，如所谓工作太忙，准备不够，代表会不如干部会解决问题等，进行了揭发和批判。大会总结了开好县、市人民代表会议的经验。这些经验是：一、领导重视，教育干部巩固地树立民主思想和作风。二、紧紧结合中心工作，解决群众当前迫切要求解决的问题，并团结教育广大群众，提高其当家做主、管理政权的国家主人翁思想，以便克服困难，完成各项工作任务。三、充分发扬民主，一切重大问题要做到反复协商，开展批评和自我批评。四、把县人民代表会议与乡人民代表会议衔接起来，切实掌握在当前建政工作中县是重要环节，乡是基础，与召开县人民代表会议同时，开好乡人民代表会议，并发挥县、乡人民政府委员会、县常务委员会及乡各种工作委员会的作用。
    会议接着讨论了省人民政府财经委员会王卓如副主任关于“当前农村基本情况及今后任务”的报告。大家进一步明确认识到要使农民的生活富足起来，只有走互助合作的道路。今冬明春，在农村中必须以冬季生产，总结丰产运动的经验，订立一九五三年农业生产计划，整理、提高、发展互助合作组织为中心任务。其他各种工作，围绕这一中心任务进行。会议在进行期间，中央人民政府内务部谢觉哉部长曾亲临指导，并向会议作了关于人民民主政权建设的报告，给到会人员以很大的鼓舞和启示。
    福建省第一次县长会议由十月七日开始，同月十
    一日结束。会议对于目前阻碍政权建设工作的错误思想进行了批判。有些干部曾认为“推动工作主要依靠干部会议、工作组和运用群众组织”，这些错误看法混淆了人民代表会议和干部会议的性质，混淆了政权组织和群众组织的性质，致使人民代表会议不能发展成为当地人民行使国家政权的机关。经过讨论批判，到会人员一致认识了政治民主化与国家工业化是分不开的，县、市人民代表会议的进一步加强，能更加提高人民群众对经济建设的责任心和积极性；国家政权的进一步民主化，将使政权在领导和保障经济建设中起更大的作用。会议最后由省人民政府张鼎丞主席做总结报告。他在总结了福建省三年来民主建政工作的成就之后着重指出：提高民主思想，发扬民主作风，是推进民主建政工作的重要关键；而一切从人民利益出发，相信人民的智慧和创造力，就是民主思想的根源。张鼎丞主席对民主建政和当前中心任务及其他工作结合的问题，都作了明确的指示。会议根据张鼎丞主席的总结，作出进一步推动民主建政工作的决议。
