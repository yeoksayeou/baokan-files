The Third Engineering Bureau of the Central Second Ministry of Machine Building (formerly the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry) has established advanced technical training classes and spare-time technical training classes to vigorously cultivate technical cadres for basic construction, and has made significant achievements and gained some experience. In the basic construction work of 1951, the bureau felt the difficulties of insufficient technical personnel and the technical abilities of existing technical personnel not keeping up with the needs of the work. Therefore, starting from February of this year, an advanced technical training class was established, and more than 20 outstanding young cadres with high school education were selected for training. The leadership also formulated a plan, determining the guiding principle of "learning while working, combining theoretical learning with practical work." Specifically, it was stipulated that within the four-year study period, all major courses of the civil engineering department of the university should be completed, including engineering knowledge, applied mechanics, mechanics of materials, drawing, estimation, structural mechanics, surveying, and simple engineering calculations. The overall requirement is to enable all students to have the technical theory and construction ability of graduates from the civil engineering department of the university after graduation. Engineers Liu Bangwen and Gao Zhongwen serve as teachers.

In the eight or nine months since the establishment of the advanced technical training class, great achievements have been made due to the active efforts of all students and the hard work of the engineers. For example, students like Li Sixi are now able to do simple design, surveying, calculation, and drawing work, and can solve some technical problems that occur in the actual work of the bureau. Some preliminary experience has also been gained during this training period: first, theoretical education must be combined with practical work. Students generally reflected that "The reason why our study has achieved such great results, in addition to the responsibility of the teachers and the efforts of everyone, is that we have excellent internship conditions." However, there have also been deviations during the study period, such as focusing on theoretical learning and neglecting practical education, which once made students feel difficult to understand. Second, ideological leadership must be strengthened. For example, when the advanced technical training class was first established, the bureau's leadership conducted ideological education on the students to "overcome difficulties and implement to the end" to improve the students' learning courage. In particular, students should be constantly educated to understand the important significance of learning technology and to improve their enthusiasm. For example, during the "Three-Anti" movement, some students developed negative emotions, feeling that learning technical theory was too brain-consuming and only wanted to learn some common knowledge. The leadership promptly criticized this. After correcting this thinking, the students worked harder to learn and quickly completed the courses of applied mechanics, surveying, estimation, and mechanics of materials in the second year of university. Everyone generally realized the great significance of basic construction work. The students reflected that this is the requirement of the country's large-scale economic construction, and we must work hard to learn and undertake the task of building the motherland.

More importantly, the achievements already made have made the leading cadres realize that solving the problem of the lack of technical cadres must rely on self-cultivation. Therefore, in addition to vigorously consolidating the advanced technical training class and creating various convenient conditions for students to study, the bureau also established a spare-time technical training class in July of this year to vigorously cultivate old cadres who have newly entered the industry, so that they can understand the knowledge of basic construction. The spare-time technical training class stipulates that lectures are given twice a week, hosted by engineer Liu Bangwen, and equipped with lecture notes, models, and other aids for students to learn. When the training class was first established, only forty or fifty people attended the class, but now it has increased to more than two hundred people, and many comrades from units such as the Bank of Communications have also volunteered to participate. It is expected that the first phase of the course will be completed in four months, so that students can understand general business and engineering knowledge.

    中央第二机械工业部第三工程处
    开办技术训练班培养基本建设技术干部
    中央第二机械工业部第三工程处（即前中央重工业部太原工程处），举办高级技术训练班和业余技术训练班，大力培养基本建设的技术干部，并已做出重大成绩，取得了一些经验。该处在一九五一年的基本建设工作中，感到有技术人员不够用和现有技术人员的技术能力赶不上工作需要的困难，因此从今年二月份起就成立了高级技术训练班，抽调二十余个具有高中程度的优秀的青年干部进行训练。领导方面并订出了计划，确定了“边学边工作，理论学习与实际工作相结合”的方针。具体规定在四年的学习期限内，要学完大学土木系所有主要课程，包括工程常识、应用力学、材料力学、绘图、估算和结构力学、测量及简单的工程计算等。总的要求是，要使所有学员在毕业后都具有大学土木系毕业的技术理论和施工能力。教师由刘邦闻、高钟文两位工程师担任。
    高级技术训练班成立以来的八、九个月中，由于全体学员的积极努力和工程师们的努力教学，已经取得了很大成绩。如学员李思喜等已能够做简单的设计、测量、计算和绘图工作，能解决该处在实际工作中发生的一些技术问题。在这一段训练期间并取得一些初步经验：首先是理论教育必须与实际工作结合。学员们普遍反映说：“我们的学习所以能得到这样大的成绩，除了老师们负责，大家努力外，就是有优越的实习条件。”但在学习期间也曾发生过偏向，如偏重理论学习，忽视实际教育，曾使学员们感到不好理解，困难多。其次，必须加强思想领导。如高级技术训练班刚成立时，该处领导就对学员进行“克服困难，贯彻到底”的思想教育，提高学员们的学习勇气。特别是要经常教育学员们认识学习技术的重要意义，提高学员的积极性。如在“三反”运动中有的学员曾产生了消极情绪，感到学习技术理论太费脑筋，而只愿学一些普通常识。领导方面就及时地给以批判。纠正这种思想后，学员们更加努力学习，很快就学完了大学二年级的应用力学、测量、估算和材料力学等课程。大家普遍认识到基本建设工作的重大意义。学员们反映说：这是国家大规模经济建设的要求，我们必须努力学习，担负祖国的建设任务。
    更重要的，是从已经取得的成绩中，使领导干部认识到解决技术干部缺乏的问题，必须靠自己培养。因此，除大力巩固高级技术训练班，给学员们创造各种学习的便利条件外，该处并从今年七月份起又创办了业余技术训练班，大力培养新转入工业的老干部，使他们懂得基本建设的知识。业余技术训练班规定每星期讲课两次，由工程师刘邦闻主持讲课，并备有讲义、模型等辅助学员学习。该训练班初办时只有四、五十人听课，现已增加到二百余人，交通银行等单位也有许多同志自愿参加。预计在四个月内讲完第一期课程，使学员们能够了解一般业务和工程上的常识。
