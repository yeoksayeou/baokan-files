According to a letter from correspondent Bao Dafu: After this year's autumn harvest, the Guichi County Farm in Anhui Province reported to its superiors that the farm had 24.6 mu of cultivated land, producing a total of 30,225 jin of rice, with an average yield of over 1,220 jin per mu. Among them, 1.06 mu of land produced 1,760 jin of rice, averaging 1,660 jin per mu. The facts stated in this report are completely false. Because this false report was not exposed, the Guichi County High-Yield Evaluation and Summary Conference and the Labor Model Conference have already rated the Guichi County Farm as a "Model Farm for High Yield." Due to the farm's particularly "good" performance, it was decided to report it to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for an award.

The situation is as follows: In early September this year, when the autumn harvest was about to end, I was working at the farm. At that time, according to statistics from the farm's technical cadres Xu Naiqing and Shi Liangsi, the farm had 24.6 mu of land, with an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. Another 1.06 mu of land had an average yield of over 1,600 jin per mu. The area of the land was measured by four people, including the farm's technical cadre Shi Liangsi and administrative cadre Liu Benguo. After confirming the facts, I drafted a report and asked the farm director, Sun Tieyun, to review it. Sun Tieyun reported this achievement at the Anqing Special District Farm Director Conference, and I also wrote a news report to the newspaper.

In mid-September, the Guichi County People's Government convened a High-Yield Evaluation and Summary Conference. Farm cadres attending the meeting called and said: "The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry will send people to inspect. Please measure the land in advance." At that time, I thought the land had already been measured, so why bother? Later, we still measured the highest-yielding field on the farm, which was originally said to be 0.51 mu, but after measurement, it turned out to be 0.91 mu. At this time, I felt there was a problem, but Shi Liangsi said: "I personally measured some of the fields, so there shouldn't be a big problem." The next day, I and the farm's technical cadres Xu Naiqing, Shi Liangsi, Guo Shunfang and others continued to measure the land in the fields. All the plots that were measured were larger than the originally reported area. At this time, the farm director, Sun Tieyun, said: "Isn't that right? How can it be so big?" He asked Xu Naiqing to recalculate, but the result was still larger than the originally reported area. After all the calculations, the originally said 24.6 mu of land was actually 34.22 mu. Based on this, the average yield per mu was only over 880 jin. The original so-called special high-yield achievement was completely false.

At that time, my mood was heavy. I thought I was a correspondent for the Party newspaper, and because I did not conduct in-depth investigation and research, I reported untruthful things. I tossed and turned in bed at night and couldn't sleep. After ideological struggle, I finally decided to make a public self-criticism. However, Sun Tieyun believed that this high-yield achievement had already been reported at the Special District County Farm Director Conference, and it was better to be a fake model than to explain the truth and be criticized. At that time, he asked me not to say anything; and he and the farm's technical section chief Xu Naiqing, technical cadre Shi Liangsi and other three people jointly planned to use the method of swapping fields to piece together another 26.38 mu of land. In this way, the yield per mu was still more than 1,100 jin (originally there were 22 fields, but after the swap, there were only 12 fields). The original report was 1.06 mu of high-yield land, but after measurement, it became more than 1.8 mu. Shi Liangsi also replaced it with a 1.29 mu plot, so that the average yield per mu was still more than 1,300 jin. After the swap, Sun Tieyun still felt that the yield was too low, so he used the smallest 0.52 mu experimental field on the farm to offset the original 0.9 mu high-yield land. At that time, I felt that their actions were wrong, but because I was afraid of offending the farm director and afraid of making a public self-criticism to the Party newspaper, I stood outside the circle and let them do whatever they wanted, and did not report it to the Party newspaper in time.

Once Sun Tieyun had made arrangements, the Anqing Special District Farm Inspection Team came to the farm for inspection. At this time, Sun Tieyun was afraid that others would leak the secret, so he asked his trusted cadre Xu Naiqing to report the false achievements, and stipulated that all reports to higher authorities from the farm in the future would be done entirely by himself. When the inspection team cadres went to the fields, Sun Tieyun only asked a trusted worker, Zhang Houchang, to accompany them, and did not allow other workers to participate. Therefore, they did not find any problems. After the inspection team left, Sun Tieyun said smugly to the cadres: "The cadre surnamed Wu from the Tongling Farm (a cadre who participated in the inspection team) is really mischievous. He said: 'Although you have high yields, neither the county nor the district has sent cadres, and the masses have not come to supervise the harvest. Who will believe it?' I said: 'It doesn't matter if the masses report higher yields. We have to hand in the grain to the state. Who would do such a stupid thing?'"

At the end of October, I was transferred to work at the Guichi County Construction Section. At this time, the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent people to inspect again. This time, the inspection was more in-depth, measuring the fields and interviewing the surrounding masses. However, because Sun Tieyun had made preparations in advance, they did not find any problems.

Sun Tieyun is a Communist Party member who has worked in the revolution for more than ten years. He has actually falsely reported achievements and deceived the people in the great patriotic high-yield movement. In this matter alone, he has lost the qualities that a Communist Party member should have. I suggest that the higher-level government immediately investigate and deal with this matter. When I made the initial summary report, I trusted the words of the technical cadres and did not conduct in-depth investigation and research. Afterwards, I did not stand firm on the people's position, did not fight against illegal acts, and did not report it to the Party newspaper in time. This is a big mistake, and I hereby make a profound self-criticism.

    安徽省贵池县农场场长孙铁云
    虚报成绩骗取“丰产模范农场”称号
    建议安徽省人民政府立即调查处理
    据通讯员包达夫来信反映：今年秋收后，安徽省贵池县农场向上级呈报说：全场有耕地二十四亩六分，共产稻三万零二百二十五斤，每亩平均一千二百二十多斤，其中有一亩零六厘田，共产稻一千七百六十斤，平均每亩产一千六百六十斤。这个报告中说的事实，完全是假的。因为这个假报告没有被揭露，贵池县全县丰产评比总结会和劳动模范大会上已把贵池县农场评为“丰产模范农场”，因该场成绩特别“好”，决定报请中央人民政府农业部给以奖励。
    事情经过是这样的：今年九月上旬，秋收将要结束的时候，我正在该场工作。当时据该场技术干部徐乃清、施亮思等统计，全场有田二十四亩六分，每亩产量平均都在千斤以上；另有一亩零六厘田，每亩平均产量一千六百多斤。田的面积经过该场技术干部施亮思、行政干部刘本国等四人丈量过。经询问属实，我就执笔写了报告，请场长孙铁云审阅。孙铁云拿这个成绩在安庆专区农场场长会议上作了报告，我也向报社写了通讯。
    九月中旬，贵池县人民政府召开丰产评比总结会，参加会议的农场干部来电话说：“省农林厅要派人检查，请事先把田量一量。”当时我想田已经量过了，何必再多此一举呢？后来，我们还是量了一块全场最高的丰产田，这块田原说是五分一厘，经过丈量后是九分一厘。这时我就感觉有问题了，施亮思却说：“有些田是我亲自量的，问题不大。”第二天我和该场技术干部徐乃清、施亮思、郭顺芳等四人继续下地丈量，凡是经过丈量的地块，都比原来报的面积大。这时场长孙铁云说：“不确实吧，哪会有这样大？”他让徐乃清重新计算，结果还是比原来说的面积大。经全部计算结果，原来说的二十四亩六分田，实际是三十四亩二分二厘，以此推算，每亩平均产量仅八百八十余斤。原来所谓特殊的丰产成绩，完全是假的。
    当时我的心情很沉重，我想我是党报通讯员，由于不深入调查研究，报道了不真实的事情，晚上在床上翻来覆去睡不着觉。经过思想斗争，最后决定作公开检讨。可是孙铁云认为这个丰产成绩已在专署县农场场长会议上报告过了，与其说明白了受批评，不如当个假模范。当时他一面叫我不要做声；一面和该场技术股长徐乃清，技术干部施亮思等三人共同策划，用抽换田亩的办法，另外拼凑了二十六亩三分八厘田。这样每亩还有一千一百多斤产量（原来共有二十二丘田，经调换后只有十二丘田）。原报的是一亩零六厘高额丰产田，经丈量后成了一亩八分多，施亮思也把它换成一亩二分九厘的一块，这样每亩平均产量还有一千三百多斤。调换以后，孙铁云还嫌产量太低，就将全场面积最小的一丘五分二厘试验田，来抵补原九分高额丰产田。我当时感觉他们这些行为都是不对的，但因为怕得罪场长，又怕向党报作公开检讨，于是就站在圈子外，听凭他们胡作非为，没有及时向党报作报道。
    孙铁云布置就绪，安庆专区农场检查组就来农场检查了。这时孙铁云怕旁人泄漏秘密，就叫亲信干部徐乃清汇报假成绩，并规定以后场内所有给上级的报告，完全由他自己做。检查组干部下田时，孙铁云只叫一个亲信工人张厚长陪着，不准其余工人参加。因此，他们什么问题也没有发现。检查组走了以后，孙铁云洋洋自得地向干部们说：“铜陵农场姓吴的干部（参加检查组的一位干部）真调皮，他说：‘你们虽然是丰产，县区既没来干部，群众又没有来监打监收，谁相信呢？’我说：‘群众多报产量没关系，我们粮食要上缴，谁肯做这样的呆事？’”
    十月底，我调贵池县建设科工作，这时华东农林部、安徽省农林厅又派人下来检查，这一次检查比较深入，量了田，又访问了周围的群众。但由于孙铁云事先有了准备，也没有查出什么问题。
    孙铁云是个共产党员，干过十多年革命工作，竟在伟大的爱国丰产运动中，虚报成绩，欺骗人民，就这一件事情来说，他已丧失了共产党员应有的品质。我建议上级政府对这件事情立即调查处理；我个人在做初次总结报告时，轻信技术干部的话，不深入调查研究，事后又不站稳人民立场，没和非法行为作斗争，更没有及时向党报作报道，这是很大的错误，我在此作深刻的检讨。
