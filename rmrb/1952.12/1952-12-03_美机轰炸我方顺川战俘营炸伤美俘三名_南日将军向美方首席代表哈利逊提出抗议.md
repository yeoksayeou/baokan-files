Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 2nd. US aircraft again bombed our side's No. 9 Suncheon POW camp, which has clear markings, at 11:50 PM on November 26th, wounding three of their own captured personnel, two of whom were seriously injured. Our Chief Representative, General Nam Il, has protested this matter to the US Chief Representative, Harrison.

This massacre was clearly premeditated by the US side. This is because not only had we already provided the US side with detailed maps indicating the location of the POW camp, and had installed clear markings at each POW camp in accordance with the agreement between the two sides, but before carrying out this bombing, the US aircraft, fearing that they might miss, dropped flares to identify the POW camp before continuously dropping bombs. At the same time, on the morning of the same day that the US side bombed this POW camp, they had bombed the vicinity of our No. 11 POW camp, the Jiangdong sub-camp, which also had clear markings, damaging four buildings in the POW camp.

Just like continuously massacring our captured personnel in large numbers, the US side has consistently used bombing and strafing to kill their own captured personnel in large numbers. Since this year alone, the US side has bombed and strafed our POW camps as many as nine times, killing and wounding more than 200 prisoners of war. These brutal incidents show that the US side not only completely disregards the safety of their own captured personnel and does not want them to return home soon, but also, for some ulterior motive, does not hesitate to repeatedly and publicly kill them. This is again the so-called "humanitarian principle" of the US side.

    美机轰炸我方顺川战俘营炸伤美俘三名
    南日将军向美方首席代表哈利逊提出抗议
    【新华社开城二日电】美方又派遣飞机在十一月二十六日晚十一时五十分，大肆轰炸设有明晰标志的我方第九号顺川战俘营，炸伤美方自己的被俘人员三名，其中二名伤势甚重。我方首席代表南日将军已就此事向美方首席代表哈利逊提出抗议。
    这一屠杀事件显然是美方蓄意进行的。因为我方不仅早已把标明战俘营位置的详尽地图交给美方，并已按照双方协议在各战俘营设有明显标志，而且美机在进行这次轰炸之前，惟恐炸得不中，曾投掷照明弹，辨认该战俘营后，才连续投掷炸弹。同时，美方在轰炸这个战俘营的当天早晨，就曾在同样设有明晰标志的我方第十一号战俘营江东分营周围进行轰炸，损毁该战俘营建筑物四座。
    美方像连续大批屠杀我方被俘人员一样，一贯用轰炸扫射来大肆杀害他们自己的被俘人员。仅自今年以来，美方轰炸扫射我方战俘营已达九次之多，共打死打伤战俘二百多名。这些残酷事件说明：美方不仅完全不关心他们自己被俘人员的生命安全，不希望他们早日回家，而且为了某种不可告人的目的，甚至于不惜屡次公开杀戮他们。这又是美方的所谓“人道原则”。
