Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 3rd:

    Regarding Mr. Menon's recent speech, I must say that his explanation of the Indian delegation's proposal and his remarks regarding the Soviet amendment once again demonstrate that our criticism of the Indian delegation's proposal is entirely correct, justified, and fair. Mr. Menon attempts to suggest that the Indian delegation's proposal opens a path to peace. Undoubtedly, neither Mr. Menon, nor the entire Indian delegation, nor anyone else here would deny that, to open a path to peace, a ceasefire must come first. One simply cannot say that we are opening a path to peace while simultaneously rejecting the Soviet delegation's proposal for an immediate and complete ceasefire on land, sea, and air in Korea. Without a ceasefire, there is no path to peace.

    Mr. Menon mentioned the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon at Panmunjom. From what he said, it can be understood that the first step towards peace is the conclusion of an armistice agreement stipulating a ceasefire. If this is the case, then I must ask: when? Tomorrow, within a week, within a month, within a year, or within five years?

    All the facts indicate that there is no reason to hope for an early conclusion of an armistice agreement, because the conclusion of such an agreement is detrimental to the American ruling circles. They are doing everything possible to sabotage such an agreement.

    The logic of Mr. Menon's arguments becomes even more incomprehensible given the well-known position of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the Indian delegation's proposal.

    The statement by Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and the statement by Mr. Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have clearly stated the positions of their respective countries regarding the path to achieving peace in Korea. Zhou Enlai's statement says: "In order to realize the urgent desire for peace of the people of the whole world, and in order to express the sincerity of the Chinese people to eagerly hope for the early restoration of peace in Korea, and to prevent the issue of prisoners of war from becoming an obstacle and excuse for achieving an armistice in Korea, we hereby express our complete support for the overall proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation to first achieve a ceasefire in Korea and then resolve the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war." In this statement, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China points out that the Central People's Government believes that the Soviet proposal "is capable of opening a path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question."

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also stated in its statement that it believes the Soviet proposal "is the most just proposal for striving for a quick end to the military actions in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean question," and "completely supports this proposal of the Soviet delegation."

    From the above, it can be clearly seen that we cannot accept the recommendations in the American proposal supported by some delegations, nor can we accept the recommendations in the Peruvian proposal, the Mexican proposal, and the Indian proposal as the basis for reaching an agreement on a ceasefire and the repatriation of prisoners of war. All these proposals are American proposals in disguise.

    Mr. Menon's words seem to suggest that the Soviet delegation proposes a ceasefire after the conclusion of an armistice agreement. But I must remind you that this is playing with words, if not worse. Our proposal says: "It is recommended that both warring parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire, that is: according to the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both warring parties, both parties cease military actions in the land, sea and air"… It can be seen from this that we propose an immediate ceasefire. We are not proposing an immediate ceasefire based on an agreement reached at some time in the future but are proposing an immediate ceasefire based on the already agreed draft agreement.

    It can be seen from this that the path we are pointing out has nothing in common with the path pointed out by the Indian proposal. To ensure that everyone no longer has any doubts about this, I must ask everyone to pay attention to the meaning of this sentence: "According to the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both warring parties." This sentence means: we recommend an immediate ceasefire based on the existing draft agreement.

    As you all remember, there is a special provision in the draft armistice agreement regarding the specific arrangements for ceasefire and armistice. Section twelve of this provision defines the procedure for a ceasefire. It states: The commanders of both opposing sides shall order and ensure that all armed forces under their control, including all units and personnel of the land, sea, and air forces, completely cease all hostile acts in Korea.

    Therefore, we propose an immediate ceasefire on the basis of Article Twelve of the draft armistice agreement. Mr. Menon says that the Indian proposal makes the same suggestion. No, you did not make the same suggestion. Not only that, you did not make a suggestion for a ceasefire at all. All you suggested in your proposal, in the second section of the preamble, was to point out with satisfaction the great achievements made in reaching a ceasefire through the Panmunjom negotiations and preliminary agreement, while ending the Korean War and resolving the Korean question were only the purposes of such negotiations and agreements.

    It can be seen from this that you did not suggest a ceasefire in your proposal, you only mentioned the Panmunjom negotiations in this way.

    On the other hand, our proposal includes an absolutely clear suggestion: "It is recommended that both warring parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire." Therefore, I strongly oppose the Indian representative making it seem as if the Indian proposal also calls for an immediate ceasefire. The Indian proposal, like the American proposal, or the Peruvian or Mexican proposals, does not make such a request.

    No matter what you say here, you cannot make us believe what is not true. You claim to be the representatives of all the people of Asia. But you are not representing the interests of the Asian people, especially the interests of the Chinese and Korean people, by suggesting that you accept our ceasefire proposal and thereby end the Korean War. When you talk about our proposal for an immediate ceasefire, you say that you do not fully understand its meaning. But how can a suggestion written in such simple and clear words as "It is recommended that both warring parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire" be something that an experienced politician cannot fully understand? What is so difficult to understand about this sentence? Of course, someone can prevaricate and say that he does not understand, but that does not mean that he can completely prevaricate. When Mr. Menon mentioned the ceasefire, he said that the Soviet delegation's suggestion regarding the ceasefire was no different from the content of the second paragraph of the preamble to the Indian proposal. But we all see that the Indian proposal does not stipulate a ceasefire, which means that it did not do the most important thing that had to be done, so the Indian proposal made no contribution to the real resolution of the Korean question, because, without a ceasefire - which is the most important, most basic and most urgent thing - it is of course impossible to have any progress on this issue.

    Mr. Jamali, the representative of Iraq, also said that he was in favor of an armistice, and he took out his own proposal or suggestion from his pocket to prove his words, which he reportedly intended to put forward. So, Mr. Jamali, why didn't you put forward your proposal? Why did you hide it in your pocket? Mr. Jamali said that he subsequently seconded India's proposal, so this issue no longer arose, and he intended to use these words to explain why he did not put forward his own proposal. But he seconded something that did not exist in the Indian proposal, and insisted that the issue no longer arose, which is complete nonsense. We have heard that everyone here hopes to end the Korean War. We have heard that everything will depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union. But, gentlemen, think about what you are saying. I ask those who have said such words, especially Mr. Menon, to pay attention. Remember that the Soviet Union not only spoke affirmatively about its desire to end the Korean War, but also made a suggestion for an immediate ceasefire. If you had accepted that proposal, it would have already become a step towards ending the war, and an important step. But you are unwilling to accept this suggestion; you use evasive tactics, saying that the issue of ending the Korean War depends entirely on the attitude of the Soviet Union. However, it is we who advocate a ceasefire. It is also we who are asking for a decision on a ceasefire to be passed today. And it is you who are unwilling to pass such a decision.

    Mr. Menon, at the end of his speech, made a dramatic request to the Soviet Union, asking the Soviet Union to second the Indian proposal in order to ensure consistency on this issue. We must ask: consistency on what? Consistency with whom? Consistency with those who have never lifted a finger to end the Korean War? Consistency with those who are not even willing to propose to the warring parties a ceasefire in Korea? You are unwilling to have a ceasefire in Korea, you do not suggest a ceasefire, and at the same time, you are appealing to us, asking us not to undermine your consistency, wanting to use this to place the responsibility on our shoulders. But your consistency is consistency on an unacceptable basis, consistency on the basis of continuing the war, while we are suggesting consistency on the basis of stopping the war. What the people of the world are asking for is precisely to stop the Korean War.

    The second issue that Mr. Menon talked about was our amendment to paragraph eight of the preamble to the original Indian proposal. Mr. Menon said that, in essence, our amendment to that paragraph of the preamble is precisely what that paragraph of text itself discusses. But that paragraph of text in the Indian delegation's proposal says that, for prisoners of war, force must not be used to prevent them from returning home, nor must force be used to force them to return home. We suggest using the following wording: "For prisoners of war, there must be an unchangeably expressed humanitarian attitude in accordance with the direct decisions of the Geneva Convention and the general spirit of that Convention."

    I have already explained why we are opposing the mention of the word "force" here in response to certain words from other representatives. I must simply talk about the essence of this issue and once again explain why we oppose this absolutely fabricated and hypocritical statement.

    They say: force must never be used for repatriation, that is, forced repatriation must never be allowed, attempting to conceal forced detention with the requirement that forced repatriation must not be allowed. Some representatives avoid talking about this aspect of the issue, and Mr. Menon only perfunctorily dealt with it. Did you not see that he simply does not know about all the events that have happened in the past; he, like some others, also admits that there have been things like forced detention in the past, but, he says, why look back on the past when people should be looking forward? However, in order to know what will happen in the future and to correctly understand people's future behavior, one must know the past situation and not forget everything in the past and the present. It is precisely because we do not forget the events that actually happened in the American prisoner of war camps that housed Chinese and Korean prisoners of war that we proposed our amendment to paragraph eight. The past cannot be ignored, just as the events happening now in American prisoner of war camps in relation to Chinese and Korean prisoners of war cannot be ignored. If one faces these facts, then the myth that Chinese and Korean prisoners of war refuse to return home will immediately disappear, and what can be clearly seen is that people who have been mentally traumatized, abused, and tortured cannot freely choose their fate and freely express their wishes even in a neutral zone. How does Mr. Menon solve this difficulty? His method is very simple. He says that these may be people who are psychologically abnormal, in his words, "psychotics," and therefore, he suggests sending these people to the hospital and not repatriating them home. But Mr. Menon, the Geneva Convention requires that sick prisoners of war also be sent home. You cannot use the excuse that they are mentally ill to lock them up in mental asylums for years on end. The Geneva Convention stipulates that sick prisoners of war should also be repatriated. Therefore, if there are truly mentally disturbed people, such as the "psychotics" you mentioned, then they should also be sent home, and they should not be left in American prisoner of war camps, and one should not try to get these semi-demented or demented people to say whether they are willing to return home or not. Questions like this, of course, cannot be asked of these mentally ill people. Where is your logic? There is simply no logic here.

    We affirm that the claim that prisoners of war have expressed their willingness and determination to oppose forced repatriation is a complete lie. This claim is fabricated, because even if there is such a refusal to repatriate, it is coerced by American terror tactics.

    Regarding this point, I must mention Mr. Lloyd's words about the impressions he supposedly personally obtained when he visited a prisoner of war camp. At that time, we pointed out that his conversation with the prisoners of war did not prove what he wanted to prove, namely: that the prisoners of war were afraid of being punished for their previous political activities in their home countries, and therefore genuinely refused repatriation. At that time, the only materials I had on hand were the conversations between American generals Colson and Dodd, the reports of the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross, and what Mr. Lloyd said here. Even at that time, we could clearly see that Mr. Lloyd's explanation was very inappropriate. We immediately said at the time that it was incomprehensible what was preventing those two or three people who spoke with Mr. Lloyd from returning home, because what Mr. Lloyd told us did not explain the motivation for such an important step as refusing to return home.

    I pointed out at the time that the example cited by Mr. Lloyd was unconvincing. He only said some meaningless, empty words and repeated some unfounded nonsense, roughly to the effect that certain Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war were unwilling to return home. I said on November 10th that everything Mr. Lloyd said here about his conversations with prisoners of war in Korea made it undoubtedly clear that this issue was indeed very clumsily fabricated - and I said that Mr. Lloyd himself did not believe what he said to us here - that the Korean American occupation authorities planned this conspiracy, the purpose of which was to undermine the armistice agreement and delay the Korean War, so that American tycoons could obtain even greater profits. Mr. Lloyd did not reply to these. It should be remembered that American monopoly capitalists made profits of over $20 billion from the Korean War last year!

    I have a document in hand that I think is essential to make known to the Committee. This is a report by William Stevenson, the Korean correspondent for the Canadian newspaper "Star Weekly", recounting his visit to a prisoner of war camp with Mr. Lloyd. In this dispatch, Mr. William Stevenson recounts his visit to a prisoner of war camp with Mr. Lloyd and reveals that in that prisoner of war camp, the US military headquarters extensively used Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee terrorists to force Chinese and Korean prisoners of war to refuse to return home.

    The dispatch says that the so-called Korean Youth Corps is engaging in activities to intimidate prisoners of war on Geoje Island. The reporter writes that he was the only reporter permitted to visit a prisoner of war camp controlled by the Korean Youth Corps on Geoje Island. During this visit, he gained some understanding of the effects of the interference of the Chinese Nationalists (Chiang Kai-shek elements). On that occasion, he was accompanied by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lloyd.

    Colonel James, a subordinate of General Lasater, explained that the Korean Youth Corps maintained discipline there and punished anyone who disobeyed. The reporter wrote that their security in the prisoner-of-war camp actually relied on the goodwill of the corps leaders who wore metal badges on their buttonholes. After General Lasater was convinced that they would not be harmed, they were escorted into the prisoner-of-war camp by the "camp commander." These leaders controlled their prisoners of war through the "camp commander." In that prisoner-of-war camp, 10,400 Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war swore an oath against repatriation. If one does a little research, one will find that this oath is consistent because the Korean Youth Corps members physically threatened anyone who had a complaint, and this threat was often carried out in the prisoner-of-war camp. The same situation existed in most other "anti-communist" prisoner-of-war camps, where Chinese instructors told prisoners of war that they had better ask to be sent to Taiwan, otherwise, they would have to stay in the prisoner-of-war camp until they died.

    William Stevenson also says in this article that the result of the implementation of this part of the Taiwan strategy is that the Korean armistice negotiations have fallen into a long-term stalemate. The representatives of the United Nations forces have adopted a policy of refusing to repatriate every prisoner who is truly afraid of returning to communist territory.... The article says: Since then, it has been proven that many of these people have no specific reason to anticipate that the Communists will oppress them, and are actually afraid of the anti-communist leaders in the prisoner-of-war camp.

    In this regard, I cannot remain silent about the following facts. Yesterday, I received a copy of a letter from Sims, the editor of the Toronto newspaper "Canadian Forum", from Toronto, which was written to Mr. Pearson, the President of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly. This letter says: Only one thing prevents peace in Korea, preventing Canadian children from returning home from the Korean front in time for Christmas, and that is the act of the US military headquarters in Korea blatantly trampling on all principles of humanitarianism and international law. The letter asked Pearson to pay attention to the shocking facts admitted by Stevenson, the Korean war correspondent for the Toronto "Star Weekly" on November 22nd. This reporter and British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lloyd had visited a prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island and saw irrefutable evidence that the educational institutions of the US Army had dispatched terrorists to the prisoner-of-war camp to force prisoners of war to join Chiang Kai-shek's army, proving that most Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war wanted to be repatriated home. That letter asked Pearson to include Stevenson's article in the archives of the United Nations General Assembly and asked Pearson to take such a stand that he would demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea and demand that the Korean issue be resolved in accordance with the Geneva Convention, thereby safeguarding Canada's national interests and the principles of humanity and international law.

    These documents should shatter that ghost story that Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war are unwilling to return home and will use force to resist returning home. Mr. Lloyd said in the Committee that he had made a special trip to Korea on behalf of his government to investigate the true situation of the prisoners of war in South Korea, but he completely failed to tell us these facts, which is really strange.

    However, William Stevenson described the situation inside these prisoner-of-war camps in a dispatch in the Canadian "Star Weekly". In this dispatch, he exposed the various cruel, tyrannical and terrorist means used by the Korean Youth Corps, Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs in these prisoner-of-war camps against Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war with the instigation and assistance of the US military authorities. Mr. Menon and the Indian delegation did not consider this; they did not consider that, under these circumstances, the words in the Indian proposal that force must never be used for this or that purpose are just empty words. At the same time, they did not consider that the so-called prisoners of war have the "right" and "freedom" to decide whether to return home is just playing with words, completely a false statement, a hypocritical statement.

    The purpose of this playing with words is completely to conceal the cruel means used by the US military headquarters against Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war, and for the benefit of the American ruling groups, to use the excuse that the prisoners of war refuse to return home to undermine the armistice agreement.

    The Soviet delegation believes that it has a responsibility to expose this hypocritical posture, so it refuses to support proposals like the one put forward by the Indian delegation. We believe that the unconditional return home of all prisoners of war is a requirement of the Geneva Convention, and a requirement of recognized principles and standards of international law. We have a responsibility to expose anyone who brutally undermines this convention and these principles. The sole purpose of refusing this request is to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations for the benefit of the American ruling groups.

    Therefore, I think it is quite possible to mention here an article in the "Commercial Daily", which said that the discussion of the possibility of achieving a ceasefire would cause the stock market prices to fall. Didn't the New York "Business Week" also say on November 28th that the armistice would inevitably cause stagnation in business activities?

    In this situation, what does the position of those who oppose the ceasefire mean? It only means one thing – continuing the Korean War, which is desperately needed by the American billionaires who are sucking human blood, sucking vast amounts of blood from the Chinese, Korean and American people.

    In this situation, what does our demand for a ceasefire in Korea mean? It means stopping the bloodshed and saving millions of lives.

    It is because of this that we say that the Soviet proposal and the Indian proposal are fundamentally different and that there is no similarity between the two.

    Mr. Menon said that the Indian proposal is the same as our suggestion for a ceasefire in Korea. No, the Indian proposal is not only different from our suggestion for a ceasefire in Korea, but it is completely contradictory. The Indian proposal does not help the end of the Korean War. On the contrary, it helps to delay the war and continue the Korean War.

    We firmly support our proposal for a ceasefire in Korea. The Indian proposal is a rejection of a ceasefire in Korea. We will never be confused by the false words and false phrases that others say here.

    The United Nations must not only use empty words or empty resolutions to strive for peace. The United Nations agencies must actively intervene to promote an immediate end to the Korean War, so that the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully.

    The Soviet Union is proud to be the initiator of the Korean armistice negotiations. Now we are authorized to strive here for the passage of a resolution for an immediate and complete end to the Korean War. We are using every effort to promote it, because we deeply know that this is the true path to achieving peace in Korea. We ask all delegations to support the Soviet proposal, because it is the true path to quickly end the Korean War and solve the overall Korean problem.

### 在联大政委会十二月一日会议上  维辛斯基关于朝鲜问题的发言

专栏：

    在联大政委会十二月一日会议上
    维辛斯基关于朝鲜问题的发言
    关于梅农先生最近的发言，我必须说，他对印度代表团提案的解释和关于苏联修正案的言论再一次地证明：我们对于印度代表团提案的批评是完全正确的、有理由的，而且是公正的。梅农先生试图说明印度代表团提案开辟了走向和平的道路。无疑的，不论是梅农先生，还是整个印度代表团，或是这里的其它人士都不会否认，要开辟走向和平的道路，必须首先停火。一个人毕竟不能够一面说我们开辟了走向和平的道路，另一方面又拒绝苏联代表团提出的建议在朝鲜的陆地、海上和空中立刻并完全停火的提案。不停火，就不能开辟走向和平的道路。
    梅农先生提到在板门店已经商定的停战协定草案。从他所说的话中可以知道走向和平的第一步是缔结规定停火的停战协定。如果是这样的话，那么我就要问：什么时候呢？明天，一个星期以内，
    一个月以内，一年以内，还是五年以内？
    所有的事实都说明：没有理由希望早日缔结停战协定，因为缔结这样一个协定对于美国统治集团是不利的。他们正在尽力破坏这样一个协定。
    由于中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对印度代表团的提案的立场是大家都知道的，梅农先生论据的逻辑就更加令人不可理解了。
    中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来先生的声明以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永先生的声明，已经明确地说明了它们两国对于达成朝鲜和平的途径的立场。周恩来的声明说：“为了实现全世界人民迫切的和平愿望，为了表示中国人民切盼朝鲜和平早日恢复的诚意，而不使遣俘问题再成为实现朝鲜停战的障碍和藉口，我们兹特表示完全赞同苏联代表团所提的先在朝鲜停战，然后解决战俘全部遣返问题的全盘建议。”中华人民共和国中央人民政府在这个声明里指出，中央人民政府相信苏联建议“是能够替和平解决朝鲜问题开辟道路的”。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在声明中也指出：它认为苏联提案“是争取迅速结束朝鲜的军事行动与和平解决朝鲜问题的最公正的建议”，并“完全拥护苏联代表团的这个建议”。
    从以上所说的，可以清楚地看出，我们不能接受某些代表团支持的美国提案中的建议，也不能接受秘鲁提案、墨西哥提案和印度提案中的建议，作为达成关于停战和遣返战俘的协议的基础。所有这些提案都是改头换面的美国提案。
    梅农先生的话似乎是说，苏联代表团建议在缔结停战协定以后停火。但我必须提醒你，这是在玩弄词句，如果不是更坏的话。我们的提案说：“建议朝鲜的交战国双方立即并完全停火，即：根据交战国双方所已经同意的停战协定草案，双方停止在陆、海、空三方面的军事行动”……由此可见，我们建议立即停火，我们并不是建议根据将来某一时候达成的协议立即停火而是建议根据已经同意的协定草案立即停火。
    由此可见，我们指出的道路和印度提案所指出的道路并无共通之处。为了使大家对这一点不再有任何怀疑，我必须请大家注意这样一句话的意义：“根据交战国双方所已经同意的停战协定草案”。这句话的意思就是：我们建议根据现有的协定草案立即停火。
    大家记得，停战协定草案中有一项关于停火与停战的具体安排的特别条文。这一项条文的第十二节确定了停火的程序。它说：敌对双方司令官命令并保证其控制下的一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的一切部队与人员，完全停止在朝鲜的一切敌对行为。
    因此，我们建议在停战协定草案第十二条的基础上立即停火。梅农先生说，印度提案提出了同样的建议。不，你并没有提出同样的建议。不仅如此，你根本就没有提出停火的建议。你在你的提案，就是序言的第二节里所提出的全部建议只是以满意的态度指出通过板门店谈判和初步协议在达成停战方面获得的很大成就，而结束朝鲜战事和解决朝鲜问题却只是这种谈判和协议的目的。
    由此可见，你并没有在你的提案里建议停火，只是这样提到板门店谈判。
    另一方面，我们的提案则包括一个绝对明确的建议：“建议朝鲜的交战国双方立即并完全停火。”因此，我断然反对印度代表把事情说得好像印度提案也要求立即停火。印度提案或美国提案也正如秘鲁或墨西哥提案一样，都没有提出这种要求。
    不论你们在这里怎样说，你们总不能使我们相信不真实的东西。你们自称是所有亚洲人民的代表。但是你们并没有代表亚洲人民的利益，首先是中国和朝鲜人民的利益，建议接受我们的停战提案从而结束朝鲜战争。你们在谈到我们的立即停战的提案时说，你们并不充分了解它的意义。但是，“建议朝鲜交战国双方立即并完全停火”，这样一个用非常简单明确的几个字写成的建议，怎么可能令一个有经验的政治人物不能充分了解呢？这句话有什么难于理解？当然，有人可以推托说他不了解，但是并不是这样就可以完全推托得掉的。梅农先生在提到停火时说，苏联代表团关于停火的建议与印度提案序言第二段的内容并无不同。但是，我们都看到，印度提案中并没有规定停火，那就是说它并没有做必须做的最重要的事，所以印度提案对真正解决朝鲜问题并无贡献，因为，如果没有停火——这是最重要、最基本与最迫切的事——当然不可能在这个问题上有任何进展。
    伊拉克代表贾马利先生也说他是主张停战的，他并从他的衣袋中掏出他自己的提案或是建议来证明他的话，据说他曾打算把这个提案或是建议提出来的。那么，贾马利先生，你为什么没有提出你的提案呢？为什么你要把它藏在你的衣袋里呢？贾马利先生说，他随后附议了印度的提案，因此这个问题就不再发生了，他打算用这样的话来解释他为什么不提出他自己的提案。但是他附议的是印度提案中并不存在的东西，而硬说这个问题不再发生了，这完全是胡说。我们听说：此间每一个人都希望结束朝鲜战争。我们听说：一切都将决定于苏联的态度。但是各位先生们，你们想一想你们在说些什么话？我请那些说过这种话的人们、特别是梅农先生注意。请记住，苏联不仅是肯定地谈到它要求结束朝鲜战争的愿望，而且曾提出了一项要求立即停火的建议。假如你们接受那个提案的话，那么，它将早已成为结束战争的一个步骤，而且是一个重要的步骤。但是你们不愿意接受这个建议；你们使用规避手段，说什么结束朝鲜战争的问题完全决定于苏联的态度。可是，主张停战的是我们。要求今天通过一项停火决定的也是我们。而不愿通过这样的决定的却是你们。
    梅农先生发言到最后时曾向苏联提出了一个戏剧性的要求，他要求苏联附议印度提案，以保证在这个问题上的一致。我们要问：在什么东西上面一致呢？与谁一致呢？与那些从没有费一指之力来结束朝鲜战争的人一致吗？与那些甚至不愿向交战国双方提出在朝鲜停火建议的人一致吗？你们不愿在朝鲜停火，你们不建议停火，同时，你们却向我们呼吁，叫我们不要破坏你们的一致，想借此把责任放在我们的身上。但是你们的一致是在一种不可接受的基础上的一致，是在继续战争的基础上的一致，而我们建议的是在停止战争的基础上的一致。全世界各国人民所要求的恰好正是停止朝鲜战争。
    梅农先生谈到的第二个问题是我们对印度原来提案的序言中第八段的修正。梅农先生说，从本质上来说，我们对序言中那一段的修正，正是那段文字的本身所论述的。但是印度代表团提案的那段文字说，对于战俘，不得使用武力来阻挠他们回家，也不得使用武力迫使他们回家。我们建议用下面的措辞：“对于战俘必须按照日内瓦公约的直接决定和该公约的总的精神，不可改变地表示的人道主义的态度。”
    我已经在答复其他代表的某些话时解释了我们为什么在这里反对提到“武力”的话。我必须很简单地谈一下这个问题的本质，再一次解释一下为什么我们反对这个绝对杜撰的和虚伪的说法。
    他们说：绝不能使用武力遣返，即是说，绝不容许强迫遣返，企图以不得强迫遣返的要求来掩饰其强迫扣留。某些代表避而不谈问题的这方面，而梅农先生也仅仅敷衍了一下。难道你们没有看出，他简直不知道过去发生的一切事件；他与其他一些人一样，也承认过去有过强迫扣留一类事情，但是，他说，当人们应该向前看的时候，为什么要回顾过去呢？可是，为了知道将来会有些什么和正确地了解人们未来的行为，就必须知道过去的情况，而且不忘记过去和现在的一切。我们正因为不忘记收容中朝战俘的美国战俘营中实际上发生过的事件，我们才对第八段提出了我们的修正。对于过去的事情是不能置之不顾的，正如对现在在美国战俘营中发生的对待中朝战俘的事件也不能置之不顾一样。假如面对这些事实，那么，说中朝战俘拒绝回家的神话马上就会消失了，而可以清楚的看到的是：在精神上受到摧残、虐待和酷刑的人，即使在中立区也不可能自由地抉择他们的命运和自由地表示他们的愿望。梅农先生如何解决这个困难呢？他的办法非常简单。他说，这些或许是心理不正常的人，用他的话说，是“精神病者”，因此，他建议把这些人送进医院，不要遣返回家。可是梅农先生，日内瓦公约要求生病的战俘也要遣送回家。你不能以他们是精神病者这种藉口来把他们成年累月地关闭在疯人院里。日内瓦公约规定患病战俘也应遣返。因此，如果真正有精神失常的人，如你所说的“精神病者”，那么，他们也应该被遣送回家，而不应该把他们留在美国战俘营里，不应该设法叫这些半疯癫的或疯癫的人来说他们愿意回家或不愿意回家。像这样的问题，当然不能向这些精神上有病的人提出。你的逻辑在那里？这里根本就无逻辑可言。
    我们肯定地说：所谓战俘已表示将反对武力遣返的意愿与决心这套的说法，全然是一个谎言。这种说法是捏造出来的，因为即使有这种拒绝遣返的情形，也是由美国的恐怖手段威迫出来的。
    关于这一点，我必须提到劳埃德先生关于据说是他在访问一个战俘营时他个人所得到的印象的话。那时，我们指出他与战俘的谈话并没有证明他要证明的东西，即：战俘们畏惧由于他们以前在本国的政治活动会遭受处罚、因而真正拒绝遣返。在当时，我手头的材料只有美国将军柯尔生与杜德的谈话、所谓红十字国际委员会的报告与劳埃德先生在这里所说的话而已。甚至就在那时，我们也清楚地看出劳埃德先生的解释是很不妥当的。我们当时立刻就说，是什么东西阻止那两三个与劳埃德先生谈话的人回家这一点，是不能理解的，因为劳埃德先生所告诉我们的话，并没有解释像拒绝回家这样重要的一个步骤的动机。
    我当时就指出劳埃德先生所举的例子是不能令人信服的，他只是说了一些没有意义的空泛的话，而且毫无根据地重复了一些无稽之谈，大意说某些朝中战俘不愿回家。我在十一月十日说，劳埃德先生在此间所说的关于他在朝鲜与战俘交谈的话，全部都使人毫不怀疑这个问题确实是很拙劣地制造出来的——我并说，劳埃德先生本人也不相信他在此间对我们说的话——朝鲜美国占领当局策划这种阴谋，其目的在于破坏停战协议，拖延朝鲜战争，以便使美国大富豪能够取得更庞大的利润。对于这些，劳埃德先生没有答复。应该记住，美国垄断资本家去年从朝鲜战争中取得的利润在二百亿美元以上！
    我手头有一个文件，我认为是必须使委员会知道的。这是加拿大报纸“明星周报”刊载的该报驻朝鲜记者威廉·史蒂文森所写的随劳埃德先生访问战俘营记。在这篇电讯里，威廉·史蒂文森先生叙述了他随劳埃德先生访问一个战俘营的经过，并透露在那个战俘营里，美军司令部广泛地利用了蒋介石和李承晚恐怖分子来迫使朝中战俘拒绝回家。
    电讯说，所谓大韩青年团正在巨济岛上从事恐吓战俘的活动。这个记者写道，他是获准参观巨济岛上大韩青年团控制下的一个战俘营的唯一的记者，在这次访问中，他对中国国民党人（蒋介石分子）的干涉的效果，有了一些了解。那一次，与他一道去的就是英国外交副大臣劳埃德。
    拉斯塔约将军的一个部下杰姆斯上校解释说，大韩青年团在那里维持纪律，并惩处任何不服从管束的人。记者写道，他们在俘虏营内的安全实际上依靠着衣服扣孔上佩着金属证章的该团领袖的善意。在拉斯塔约将军相信他们不会受伤害以后，他们由“营长”护送到俘虏营里去，这些领袖就是通过“营长”对他们的战俘实行控制的。在那个俘虏营里，有一万零四百个中国和北朝鲜战俘宣誓反对遣返。假如稍作研究，就会发现这种誓言是一致的，这是因为大韩青年团团员对每一个有怨言的人施以体罚威胁，而这种威胁是时常在俘虏营里实行的。大多数其他“反共”战俘营里也存在着同样的情形，在这些俘虏营里，中国教官们对战俘说，他们最好要求送到台湾去，否则的话，他们就要留在俘虏营里一直到他们死的时候为止。
    威廉·史蒂文森在这篇文章里又说，台湾战略的这一部分实施的结果，是朝鲜停战谈判陷入长期的僵局。联合国军代表采取了这样一种政策：拒绝遣返每一个真正害怕回到共产党领土上去的俘虏……。该文说：自那时起，就已经证明：这些人中有许多人并没有具体原因来预料共产党会压迫他们，实际上倒是害怕战俘营里的反共头目。
    在这一方面，对于下述事实我不能保持缄默。昨天，我接到一家多伦多报纸“加拿大论坛报”的编辑席姆斯由多伦多寄来的一封信的副本，这封信是写给第七届联合国大会主席皮尔逊先生的。这封信说：只有一件事情使朝鲜的和平不能实现，使加拿大的子弟不能及时由朝鲜前线回家过圣诞节，而这件事就是朝鲜美军司令部悍然践踏一切人道主义与国际法原则的行为。这封信要求皮尔逊注意刊载在十一月二十二日的多伦多“明星周报”上的朝鲜战地记者史蒂文森所承认的骇人听闻的事实。这位记者和英国外交副大臣劳埃德曾经访问一个巨济岛上的战俘营，并且看到无可辩驳的证据，证明美国陆军的文教机构派遣恐怖分子到战俘营里去，强迫战俘加入蒋介石军队，证明大多数中朝战俘都希望被遣送回家。那封信要求皮尔逊把史蒂文森那篇文章列入联合国大会的档案，并要求皮尔逊采取这样
    一种立场，就是：要求朝鲜立即停火、要求按照日内瓦公约解决朝鲜问题，从而维护加拿大的民族利益以及人道和国际法的原则。
    这些文件应该能粉碎那种所谓朝中战俘不愿回国并将使用武力抗拒回国的鬼话了。劳埃德先生在委员会上说过，他曾代表他的政府特地到朝鲜去了一趟，调查在南朝鲜的战俘的真正处境，可是他完全没有把这些事实告诉我们，这真是怪事。
    不过，威廉·史蒂文森却在加拿大“明星周报”的一篇通讯里面，描写了这些战俘营里面的情况。他在这篇通讯里，揭露了这些战俘营的大韩青年团、蒋介石和李承晚匪帮在美军当局的怂恿和协助下，对朝中战俘施行的种种残酷、暴虐和恐怖手段。梅农先生和印度代表团都没有考虑到这一点；他们没有考虑到，在这种情况下，印度提案内所说的绝不容许为这种或那种目的使用武力的字句，都不过是空话，同时也没有考虑到，所谓战俘有“权利”和“自由”决定是否回国，不过是玩弄字眼，完全是一派假话，一派虚伪的话。
    这样玩弄字句的目的，完全是要掩饰美军司令部对中朝战俘采用的残酷手段，是为了美国统治集团的利益，藉口战俘拒绝回家，来破坏停战协定。
    苏联代表团认为它有责任揭露这种伪善的姿态，因此它拒绝支持像印度代表团提出的那种提案。我们认为，所有战俘无条件返家是日内瓦公约的要求，是公认的国际法原则与标准的要求，谁要横暴地破坏这公约和原则，我们有责任加以揭露。拒绝这个要求的唯一目的是要为了美国统治集团的利益而破坏朝鲜停战谈判。
    所以，我认为很可以在这里提一下“商务日报”上的一篇文章，这篇文章说，可能获致停火的议论将造成股票市场价格的跌落。纽约“商业周刊”在十一月二十八日不是也说停战将必不可免地造成商业活动的呆滞吗。
    在这种情况下，那些反对停火的人的立场意味着什么呢？它只意味着一件事——继续朝鲜战争，这是吮人类的血，吮中国、朝鲜及美国人民大量的血的美国亿万富翁所极度需要的。
    在这种情况下，我们要求朝鲜停火意味什么呢？这意味停止流血及拯救千百万人的生命。
    就是因为这样，所以我们说苏联提案与印度提案有基本上的不同，而且两者毫无相同之点。
    梅农先生说，印度提案与我们的要求朝鲜停火的建议是一样的。不，印度提案不但与我们的要求朝鲜停火的建议不一样，而且是完全背道而驰的。印度提案并不能帮助朝鲜战争的终止，相反，它帮助拖延战争，继续朝鲜战争。
    我们坚决支持我们的朝鲜停火的建议。印度提案是拒绝朝鲜停火的。我们决不因别人在这里所说的虚假的话与虚假的字句而感到迷惑。
    联合国必须不光用空话或空洞的决议来争取和平。联合国机构必须积极干预促使立即停止朝鲜战争，从而使朝鲜问题获得和平解决。
    苏联是朝鲜停战谈判的倡议者，我们以此感到自豪。现在我们受权在此争取通过立即全部停止朝鲜战争的决议。我们正用一切努力来促成它，因为我们深知，这是实现朝鲜和平的真正道路。我们要求所有代表团支持苏联提案，因为它是真正迅速停止朝鲜战争、解决全盘朝鲜问题的道路。
