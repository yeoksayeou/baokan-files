The following measures regarding the prevention of asphalt poisoning were approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 17, 1952:

I. Production departments should be responsible for improving the packaging of asphalt to ensure it is sturdy. For asphalt transported by vehicles and ships, iron drums or wicker baskets lined with reed mats (or straw bags) and paper should be used. If it is truly difficult to use the above packaging methods, double-layer straw bags may be appropriately used for short-distance asphalt transportation. The words "Toxic Asphalt" must be marked on the outside of all packaging.

II. Before consignment, the shipping department and the loading and unloading department must inspect the asphalt packaging. If any packaging does not comply with the previous article and may cause poisoning, it must be returned to the shipping department for improved packaging before handling.

III. Asphalt awaiting shipment must not be placed in direct sunlight or in places where it can easily melt. If there is any leakage of powder during packaging and handling, water must be sprinkled.

IV. Loading, unloading, and handling asphalt or asphalt-containing products should generally be carried out at night: in spring and autumn, before 6:00 AM and after 8:00 PM; in winter, before 6:00 AM and after 6:00 PM; in summer, before 5:00 AM and after 9:00 PM. If work is carried out during the day, it is limited to overcast days without sunlight and only if there is shelter.

V. Workers loading and unloading asphalt should have a 15-minute break every hour of work. If working in ship holds or warehouses, shifts should be changed every half hour. Workers boiling asphalt for road paving or construction should have a 10-minute break every half hour of work, or adopt a two-shift rotation system. Workers directly producing asphalt should not work more than six hours of actual work time per day.

VI. The administrative departments of factories and mines or the handling administrative departments should provide workers engaged in the production, loading, unloading, handling, and use of asphalt with the following protective equipment and hygiene facilities, and be responsible for conducting protection education for workers:

	(1) When working, workers must wear work clothes, special shirts, gloves, short leather shoes, protective glasses, and filter respirators. Exposed skin, such as the face and neck, should be completely covered with protective ointment. When casting asphalt blocks, workers should wear gas masks.

	(2) Workers must not casually take off any protective equipment during work, and it is forbidden to touch asphalt directly with their hands or rub exposed skin. When protective glasses and respirators need to be taken off and wiped, others should do it with clean hands and re-wear them; when exposed skin needs to be rubbed, it should be washed clean with water first before rubbing, and work can only continue after reapplying protective ointment.

	(3) After work, workers must use facial soap (not laundry soap) for showering, dry with a soft towel, apply moisturizing skin ointment (such as Vaseline), and then change into their own clothes before going home. Workers must not take work clothes, special shirts, gloves, leather shoes, protective glasses, and respirators home.

	(4) Workers' protective equipment and personal clothing should have separate storage boxes. Work clothes should be washed once a week; special shirts should be washed after each use.

VII. Cities that frequently load and unload asphalt should establish specialized asphalt loading and unloading teams or groups, and designate fixed stations for asphalt loading and unloading.

VIII. Workers suffering from skin diseases or conjunctival eye diseases, or those who are overly sensitive to asphalt stimulation, must not engage in the production, loading, unloading, handling, or use of asphalt.

IX. Tools should be used for loading, unloading, and handling asphalt; it is strictly forbidden for one person to carry it on their shoulders.

X. Workers loading, unloading, and handling asphalt should work on the windward side when it is windy; if the wind is strong enough to cause dust to fly, work should be stopped immediately.

XI. Vehicles, ship holds, and freight yards that have transported asphalt or asphalt-containing products, as well as those that have unloaded asphalt or asphalt-containing products, should be thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed.

    中央人民政府劳动部关于防止沥青中毒的办法
    （一九五二年十二月十七日经中央人民政府政务院批准）
    一、生产部门应负责改善沥青的包装，使其牢固。对于经由车船运输的沥青，应采用铁桶或荆条篓内衬蒲席（或草袋）和纸的包装方法。如采用上述包装方法，确有困难时，对于近途运输的沥青，得适当采用双层草袋的包装方法。在各种包装外面必须标明“有毒沥青”字样。
    二、托运部门在托运前，搬运部门在承运时，均应检查沥青包装，如发现有不合前条规定并可能造成中毒情事者，须退回托运部门设法改善包装后，方可搬运。
    三、待运的沥青不得置放于太阳光下或易于融化的场所。在包装和搬运时，如有散漏粉末的情况，必须洒水。
    四、装卸、搬运沥青或含有沥青成分的制品，一般应在夜间进行：春秋二季在早六时前，晚八时后；冬季在早六时前，晚六时后；夏季在早五时前，晚九时后。如在白天工作，则仅限于无太阳的阴天且有棚盖设备者始可进行。
    五、装卸沥青工人，每工作一小时应有十五分钟的休息。如在船舱、库房内工作，每半小时应换班
    一次。铺路或建筑中的熬炒沥青的工人，每工作半小时应有十分钟的休息，或采用两班轮换制。直接生产沥青的工人，每天实际工作时间不得超过六小时。
    六、对从事生产、装卸、搬运、使用沥青的工人，应由其隶属的厂矿行政方面或搬运行政部门按下列规定供给工人防护用品及卫生设备，并负责对工人进行防护教育：
    （1）工人工作时，必须着用工作服、专用衬衣、手套、短统皮鞋；佩戴防护眼镜及过滤式呼吸器；对于外露皮肤如脸部颈部应遍涂防护药膏。在沥青铸块时，工人应戴防毒面具。
    （2）工人在工作过程中不得随便脱掉、摘下任何防护用品，禁止以手直接接触沥青，禁止揉擦外露皮肤。防护眼镜与呼吸器必须取下揩拭时，应由他人以清洁的手代作和重新佩戴；外露皮肤需要揉擦时，应先以清水洗净，始可揉擦，并须在重新涂抹防护药膏后，方得继续工作。
    （3）工人工作完毕须使用洗脸肥皂（不得使用洗衣肥皂）进行淋浴，以软毛巾擦干，再涂以润泽皮肤的油膏（如凡士林）后，换上自己的衣服始得回家。工人不得将工作服、专用衬衣、手套、皮鞋、防护眼镜及呼吸器等携带回家。
    （4）工人使用的防护用品及便服等应有分别存放的箱柜。工作服，每周洗涤一次；专用衬衣，用
    一次洗一次。
    七、经常装卸、搬运沥青的城市，应成立专门装卸搬运沥青队或小组，并指定装卸沥青的固定车站。
    八、患有皮肤病或结膜眼疾者，或对沥青刺激过分敏感的工人，不得从事生产、装卸、搬运、使用沥青的工作。
    九、装卸、搬运沥青应使用工具，严禁一人肩扛。
    十、装卸、搬运、使用沥青工人，如遇刮风时，应站在上风头工作；如风大可使粉尘飞扬时，应即停止工作。
    十一、装运过沥青或含有沥青成分制品的车辆、船舱以及曾经卸过沥青或含有沥青成分制品的货场，均应施以彻底的清扫与刷洗。
