Value the Experiences of This Year's Fertilizer Supply and Prepare for Next Year's Fertilizer Supply Work

This year, the cooperative system nationwide, entrusted by the state, undertook the task of supplying 2,120,000 tons of cake fertilizer and 254,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to the entire North China and East China regions, and the majority of Central South, Northwest, and Southwest regions. This figure is about three times the total amount of fertilizer supplied last year. As of the end of October, the national cooperative system had overfulfilled the original plan for supplying commercial fertilizer. This unified and large-scale supply of fertilizer to farmers in a timely manner across the country according to a predetermined plan by the cooperative system is unprecedented in Chinese history. It has played a significant role in supporting farmers in carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign and improving unit area yield, and is warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers across the country.

This year, the state allocated 1.5 trillion yuan as fertilizer loans to support agricultural production, which is equivalent to five times the fertilizer loans last year. However, due to the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production nationwide, this loan still cannot meet the objective needs. In order to rationally utilize this fund and give full play to its effectiveness, the cooperative system adopted the correct method of expanding cash sales and reducing credit sales, so as to use the state's loans on the farmers who need them most. Judging from the statistical materials of fertilizer supply by the national cooperative system in August, cash sales accounted for 79% of the total supply, and credit sales accounted for 21%, and the proportion of credit sales was greatly reduced compared with last year (last year, credit sales accounted for 90% of the total supply). This shows that the vast number of farmers have the power to purchase fertilizer with cash, which means that the above-mentioned policy is completely correct. With this year's bumper harvest of crops, farmers' ability to invest in land will inevitably increase, which will create more favorable conditions for further expanding cash sales in the future. Therefore, when carrying out fertilizer supply work this winter and next year, in addition to providing partial credit sales to farmers and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who do have difficulty in purchasing fertilizer, and giving appropriate consideration to disaster areas, new areas, and ethnic minority areas, we should continue to implement the policy of expanding cash sales so as to enable existing funds to play a greater role. In the past, some cadres did not conduct in-depth investigations and research on the economic conditions of the masses, blindly emphasized that the masses were unable to purchase fertilizer, and demanded to expand the amount of credit sales, or indiscriminately carried out average credit sales regardless of the situation, which was wrong. This one-sided mass viewpoint and egalitarian approach should be strived to overcome.

This year, cooperatives in some regions, in order to expand the funds for operating fertilizer and better meet the needs of the masses for fertilizer, carried out the business of storing real objects and pre-selling, organizing the funds of the masses and solving the problems of the masses. This method should be vigorously promoted. The East China Cooperative initially carried out this business this year, and concentrated more than 120 billion yuan from the masses (accounting for 8% of the total funds for operating fertilizer in the region), which partially solved the difficulty of lack of funds. Experience has proved that as long as party organizations, people's governments, and cooperative cadres at all levels attach importance to this work, use various opportunities to hold meetings in various forms, conduct systematic patriotic production increase education for farmers, break the ideological concerns of farmers who are afraid of "showing wealth" and afraid that "supply will not be timely after storing real objects," encourage the masses to store real objects and pre-purchase fertilizer, and publicize and organize the vast number of farmers to store real objects and pre-purchase through activists among the masses, then this work can be carried out. Appropriate preferential treatment should be given to farmers who implement real object storage and pre-purchase, so that the masses can more actively store real objects and pre-purchase. Pure political mobilization cannot achieve the desired results.

Cooperatives in many regions across the country started purchasing raw materials and processing them locally as early as October last year. This is a good way to improve fertilizer management. This year, the cake fertilizer processed locally by the East China Cooperative accounted for 79.5% of the total fertilizer supply, which increased six times compared with last year. The cake fertilizer processed locally in North China also increased four times compared with last year. Experience has proved that the practice of "obtaining locally, short-distance transportation, supplemented by long-distance allocation" is completely in line with the principle of economy. It can reduce many allocation and transportation procedures, reduce commodity circulation costs, and reduce fertilizer costs. The price of soybean cake processed locally in the former Southern Jiangsu region was 60 yuan lower per catty than the soybean cake transferred from the Northeast, which is a very good example. In terms of allocation and transportation, according to this year's experience, direct transportation should be resolutely implemented, and intermediate loading, unloading, and storage links should be reduced. Cooperatives at all levels should make careful plans for allocating and receiving goods in advance, and transport the fertilizer from the factory to the stations and docks in the sales area, and directly distribute it to the retail networks. This year, the Grain Management Department of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives allocated 400,000 tons of soybean cake, and saved 8 billion yuan from reducing circulation costs and reducing losses alone. In addition, the method of organizing the masses to collectively purchase fertilizer in various retail links is also worth promoting. It not only saves the labor and animal power of the masses, but also greatly improves the work efficiency of the cooperative.

Promoting chemical fertilizer should become an important task of the cooperative. This year, the regions where the cooperative's chemical fertilizer supply work was done well were mostly focused on high-yield areas, and were carried out through labor models and mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. This is because the water conservancy conditions in high-yield areas are better, which is suitable for the application of chemical fertilizer, and the level of awareness of labor models and mutual aid group members is also high, and it is easy to accept new things. In order to smoothly promote chemical fertilizer, technical guidance must be organized. This year, Zhucheng, Jiaoxian, Jimo, and Jidong counties in Shandong Province all held small-scale technical training classes. In one month, more than 6,400 people learned how to apply chemical fertilizer, which greatly improved farmers' confidence in applying chemical fertilizer. Many grassroots cooperatives also organized farmers to visit farmland where chemical fertilizer was applied after rain to see the effect of chemical fertilizer, which also encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for using chemical fertilizer.

This year's fertilizer supply work of the cooperative still has some shortcomings. The main shortcomings are that some cooperatives add profits at each level, cause excessive damage and loss, and conceal costs during the operation process. For example, the former Northern Anhui Cooperative was found to have over-reported 3 billion yuan when purchasing soybeans on behalf of the East China General Cooperative; the Central South Region Cooperative General Cooperative also over-reported 4 billion yuan in expenses when purchasing 510 million catties of soybeans in Henan. The Henan Province, Special Zone, and County-level cooperatives jointly purchased oil cakes in Xinyang. The original price was 610 yuan per catty. After six hands, the profit was added six times. When transported to Xiangyang, Hubei, the cost increased to 1,142 yuan per catty, while the local market price was only 900 yuan, resulting in a large number of oil cakes that could not be sold; local farmers were very dissatisfied with this.

Another shortcoming of the cooperative's fertilizer supply work is that it does not pay enough attention to storage work, so that fertilizer is often damp, mildewed or exposed to rain. According to statistics from 15 counties in the former Pingyuan Province, 3.29 million catties of oil cakes were mildewed due to poor storage. In the future, leading cadres of cooperatives at all levels must seriously treat warehouse management work, systematically establish and improve various systems, and at the same time strengthen the concept of cadres cherishing state property, so as not to allow this situation to continue.

With the development of the production movement in the vast rural areas, farmers' demand for fertilizer is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the task of supplying fertilizer by cooperatives in 1953 is even greater than this year. Cooperatives at all levels must pay close attention to this work and further improve the fertilizer supply work for next year on the basis of this year.

    重视今年供应肥料的经验，作好明年供应肥料工作
    今年全国合作社系统接受国家委托，担负了供应华北、华东全部地区，中南、西北、西南大部地区共二百一十二万吨饼肥和二十五万四千吨化学肥料的任务。这个数字约为去年供应肥料总额的三倍。到十月底为止，全国合作社系统已经超额完成了原订的供应商品肥料的计划。合作社这样统一地、大量地按照预定计划在全国范围内及时供应农民肥料，在我国历史上还是空前的。它对支援农民开展爱国丰产运动，提高单位面积产量起了巨大的作用，为全国广大农民所热烈欢迎。
    今年国家为了支援农业生产，以一万五千亿元作为肥料贷款，这个数字相当于去年肥料贷款的五倍。但是，由于全国农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，这笔贷款仍不能满足客观的需要。合作社系统为了合理地运用这笔资金，充分发挥它的效能，采用了正确的扩大现售，缩小赊销的办法，以便把国家的贷款，用在最需要贷款的农民身上。从八月份全国合作社系统供应肥料的统计材料看，现售额占全部供应额的百分之七十九，赊销额占百分之二十一，赊销比重比去年大大降低了（去年赊销额占供应总额的百分之九十）。这说明了广大农民是有力量以现款购买肥料的，也就是说明了上述方针是完全正确的。随着今年农作物的丰收，农民对土地投资的力量必然还要增加，这就给今后进一步扩大现售创造了更为有利的条件。因此，在今冬和明年开展供应肥料工作时，除对购买肥料确有困难的农民及烈属、军属应进行部分赊销，并对灾区、新区以及少数民族地区给以适当照顾外，应该继续贯彻扩大现售的方针，以便使现有的资金发挥更大的作用。过去有些干部对群众经济状况不进行深入调查研究，盲目强调群众无力购买肥料，要求扩大赊销额，或是不分情况一律平均赊销，这都是不对的。这种片面的群众观点和平均主义的作法，应当努力加以克服。
    今年若干地区的合作社为了扩大经营肥料的资金，更好地满足群众对肥料的需求，开展了存实预售业务，组织群众的资金，解决群众的问题，这种方法是应该大力提倡的。华东区合作社今年初步开展了这一业务，就从群众手里集中起来一千二百多亿元（占全区经营肥料资金总额的百分之八），部分地解决了资金缺乏的困难。经验证明，只要各级党组织、人民政府和合作社干部重视这一工作，利用各种时机，召开各种形式的会议，对农民进行系统的爱国丰产教育，打破农民怕“露富”怕“存实以后不能按时供应”等思想顾虑，鼓励群众存储实物，预购肥料，并通过群众中的积极分子，宣传和组织广大农民存实预购，那末，这一工作是可以开展起来的。对于实行存实预购的农民，应给以适当的优待，使群众能更积极地存实预购。单纯的政治动员是不能达到预期效果的。
    全国不少地区的合作社早在去年十月就着手收购原料，就地加工。这是一种改善肥料经营业务的好办法。今年华东区合作社由地方加工的饼肥，占供应肥料总数的百分之七十九点五，较去年的比重增加了六倍。华北区由地方加工的饼肥，也比去年增加了四倍。经验证明：“就地取给，短距离运输，辅以远地调拨”的做法，完全符合节约的原则，它可以减少许多调拨、运输的手续，减低商品流转费用，降低肥料成本。前苏南区当地加工的豆饼，每斤价格要比从东北调入的豆饼低六十元，就是很好的例子。在调拨运输上，根据今年的经验，应坚决实行直线运输，并应减少中间装卸、储存环节。各级合作社应预先周密地做好拨货、进货计划，把肥料由工厂运至销地的车站、码头，迳直分散到各零售网中。全国合作总社粮食经理部今年调拨四十万吨豆饼，从减低流转费用和降低损耗两项中就节约了八十亿元。此外，在各零售环节组织群众集体购肥的办法，也是值得提倡的。它不仅节省了群众的劳力和畜力，而且也大大提高了合作社的工作效率。
    推广化学肥料，应成为合作社的一项重要任务。今年合作社供应化学肥料工作做得好的地区，大都是以丰产区为重点，通过劳动模范和互助组、农业生产合作社进行的。这是因为丰产区水利条件较好，宜于施用化学肥料，劳动模范和互助组组员觉悟程度也高，容易接受新鲜事物。为了顺利推广化学肥料，必须组织技术指导。山东省诸城、胶县、即墨、即东四县今年都曾开办了小型技术训练班，一月之中就有六千四百多人学会了施用化学肥料的方法，大大提高了农民对施用化学肥料的信心。很多基层合作社在雨后组织农民到施用了化学肥料的农田中参观化学肥料的效果，也鼓舞了农民使用化学肥料的热情。
    今年合作社的供应肥料工作还是存在着若干缺点的。主要的缺点是某些合作社在经营过程中层层加利、多打伤耗、隐瞒成本。例如前皖北合作社代华东总社收购大豆，已被查出多报了三十亿元；中南区合作总社在河南收购大豆五亿一千万斤，也多报了四十亿元的费用。河南省、专区、县三级合作社联合在信阳收购油饼，原价每斤六百一十元，经过了六道手，就加了六次利，运到湖北襄阳，每斤成本就增加到一千一百四十二元，而当地市价仅九百元，以致大量油饼销不出去；当地农民对此很不满意。
    合作社供应肥料工作的另一个缺点是对保管工作重视不够，以致肥料常常受潮，霉烂或遭受雨淋。据前平原省十五个县的统计：因保管不善而致霉烂的油饼即达三百二十九万斤。今后各级合作社的领导干部必须认真对待仓储管理工作，系统地建立和健全各种制度，同时加强干部爱护国家财产的观念，不使这种情况继续发生。
    随着广大农村生产运动的开展，农民对肥料的需求日益迫切，因此，一九五三年合作社供应肥料的任务比今年更大。各级合作社必须十分重视这一工作，在今年的基础上，把明年的供应肥料工作更提高一步。
