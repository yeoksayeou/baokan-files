    To implement the policy of "placing basic construction in a primary position," the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant has formulated a specific plan to transfer cadres to participate in basic construction work. It plans to transfer ten engineers, two technicians, and twenty-five technicians before the end of the year, and four section chiefs, twelve staff members, and thirty-five clerks before the spring of next year to basic construction positions.
    According to the actual situation of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, it is difficult to transfer this group of cadres. However, after the plant's Party Committee led the masses in repeated studies, they found potential forces. Not only can they complete the transfer task from the existing personnel, but they can also cultivate and promote a group of cadres who can take on production tasks in a short period of time. The Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant's ability to quickly transfer outstanding cadres to participate in basic construction is mainly due to the leading cadres' ability to truly understand the importance of basic construction. After the secretary of the plant's Party Committee listened to Cao Weilian, the director of the East China Branch of the Electrical Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, conveying the spirit of the National Electrical Industry Professional Conference, he clearly realized that transferring cadres from the production department to participate in basic construction work was a top-priority political task. Therefore, at the meeting of Party Committee secretaries and factory directors of the affiliated factories convened by the Electrical Industry Branch Bureau, he took the lead in proposing a guarantee to complete the task. After returning to the factory, he held two Party Committee meetings in a row to convey the message to all leading cadres. Initially, some cadres felt "very headache" when they heard that a large number of cadres were to be transferred again, but under the leadership of the Party Committee, after mobilization, this sentiment was reversed. The plant's Personnel Section has ranked the existing cadres and analyzed both the transfer and training aspects. At the same time, after the leading cadres reached a consensus in their thinking, the plant successively convened meetings of section chiefs and workshop directors and a meeting of all factory workers, explaining the significance of transferring cadres and calling on workers to obey the transfer and participate in basic construction. The workers were able to recognize the importance of meeting the needs of the rapid development of national industrial construction and were in high spirits. Those leaving the factory guaranteed to do a good job in basic construction, while those remaining in the factory guaranteed to take on production tasks.
    After repeated studies by the leading cadres and masses of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, they found many ways to train cadres: such as conducting mass cadre recommendation movements in a guided manner through this year's year-end summary work, inspection of patriotic conventions, and selection of model workers. All workers who are active and responsible in their work, study diligently, have made significant progress in technology, and have made greater contributions to production can be promoted to appropriate positions after "mass recommendation and leadership approval." At the same time, technical assessments and promotions can be carried out among workers. Technical workers who meet the standards of technicians will be promoted to technicians; technicians who meet the standards of engineers will be promoted to engineers. According to the above two methods, it is estimated that a total of ninety-two people can be promoted to engineers, technicians, section chiefs, workshop directors, team leaders, and group leaders this winter and spring. In addition, the plant plans to adopt methods such as rotating cadre training, holding professional research meetings (such as researching and promoting high-speed cutting methods, two-handed welding methods, etc.), strengthening workers' spare-time learning of politics, culture, and technology, training apprentices, and conducting education through various movements next year to train more than 200 cadres.

### 上海电机厂坚决抽调干部参加基本建设

    上海电机厂坚决抽调干部参加基本建设
    上海电机厂为了贯彻执行“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，已经拟出抽调干部参加基本建设工作的具体计划，准备在年底前抽调工程师十名、技师二名、技术员二十五名，明年春季前抽调科长四名、科员十二名、办事员三十五名到基本建设工作岗位上去。
    根据上海电机厂的实际情况，抽调这批干部是有困难的。但是，该厂党委会领导群众反覆研究后，找出了潜在力量，不但能从现有人员中完成抽调任务，而且有可能在短期内培养和提拔一批能担负起生产任务的干部。上海电机厂能迅速抽调优秀干部参加基本建设，主要是由于领导干部能真正领会基本建设的重要意义。该厂党委书记听取了中央人民政府第一机械工业部电器工业局华东分局局长曹维廉传达全国电器工业专业会议的精神以后，明确认识了从生产部门中抽调干部去参加基本建设工作是一个头等重要的政治任务。因此，在电器工业分局召开的所属各厂党委书记、厂长会议上，他首先带头提出完成任务的保证。回厂后，接连开了两次党委会议，向全厂领导干部进行了传达。最初，部分干部听到又要抽调大批干部，感到“很头痛”，但在党委会的领导下，经过动员，扭转了这一情绪。该厂人事科已将现有干部进行排队，就抽调和培养两方面进行了分析。同时，该厂在领导干部思想取得一致后，又先后召开了科长、车间主任一级干部会议及全厂职工会议，讲明抽调干部的意义，号召职工服从调配，参加基本建设。职工都能认识满足国家工业建设迅速发展的需要的重要性，情绪很高。离厂人员保证做好基本建设工作，留在厂内的人员则保证担负起生产任务。
    上海电机厂领导干部和群众反覆研究后，找出了许多培养干部的办法：如通过今年年底总结工作、检查爱国公约和评选劳动模范，有领导地进行群众性的推荐干部运动。凡是工作积极负责，学习认真，技术有显著进步，对生产有较大贡献的职工，经过“群众推荐，领导批准”，可以提升到适当岗位上来。同时可以在职工中进行技术考核及提拔工作，技术工人如达到了技术员的标准时即升为技术员；技术员达到工程师标准时即升为工程师。根据以上两项办法，估计在今冬明春可提升为工程师、技师、技术员、科长、车间主任、工段长、组长的共九十二人。另外，该厂拟在明年采用轮训干部、开专业研究会议（如研究推广高速切削法、双手电焊法等）、加强职工政治文化及技术等的业余学习、培养艺徒、通过各种运动进行教育等办法，培养干部二百多名。
