Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: The "Pravda" published an editorial on December 17th entitled "New Crimes of American Aggressors in Korea." The editorial said: The atrocities of the American aggressors are endless. After launching the bloody intervention in Korea, they committed unprecedentedly heinous atrocities, insulting human conscience.

People originally thought that the atrocities committed time and time again by the American beasts against unarmed prisoners of war on Geoje Island had reached their limit. But just a few days ago, the American beasts committed new atrocities. On Pongam Island, the crimes of the American army far exceeded the "records" they created on Geoje Island.

After describing the bloody massacre on Pongam Island, the editorial stated that the American beasts are taking bloody measures against prisoners of war and civilians detained in the many death camps in the United States. They treat prisoners of war and civilians in a criminal manner, trampling on the most basic principles of international law.

The editorial pointed out that murder, torture, and mass slaughter—all of this has only one purpose, which is to threaten prisoners of war and force them to embark on the road of betraying their motherland, incorporating them into the American army to participate in this brutal war, to fight their own relatives, parents, brothers, sisters, wives, and children.

The Pongam Island incident once again powerfully exposed the aggressive plans of the American ruling clique in Korea. This incident exposed the true meaning of the stupid means used by American generals on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. Even Professor Fleming of the United States admitted in an article published in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science that it was the American position that made the prisoner of war issue the "only obstacle to concluding an armistice agreement."

The editorial said that the unprecedented heinous crimes committed by the American aggressor troops in Korea have aroused angry protests from peace-loving people of all countries. Hundreds of millions of kind people in all countries of the world unanimously demand that the American aggression in Korea be stopped. People from various countries and continents, representing different races and nationalities, and holding different political and religious beliefs, spoke on the solemn platform of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. They unanimously demanded an end to the Korean War. The new and cruel atrocities committed by the American aggressor troops on Pongam Island prove that they have absolutely no intention of abandoning their bloody gamble policy in Korea.

The conscience of the people of the world cannot and will never tolerate the atrocities of the American demons. Kim Young-soon, the representative of war-torn Korea, spoke on the platform of the World People's Peace Congress about the tragic scene of a Korean mother, which is now vividly present in the minds of thousands of people. The American aggressor troops snatched the baby from the mother's arms, killed him, gouged out his eyes, and even forced the unfortunate mother to eat these things. This Korean mother hated the executioners so much that she lunged at them and was killed as a result. The noble image of this Korean mother inspired all upright people to actively and resolutely fight for the immediate cessation of the Korean War.

The editorial said: Is it not clear to everyone that the American rulers and their lackeys' hypocritical shouts of "voluntary repatriation" are actually using violence to force prisoners of war to oppose their own people, are a policy of obstructing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and are continuing and expanding the bloody aggression against the heroic Korean people?

If there are still people who want to use the resolutions imposed on the United Nations General Assembly by the Anglo-American bloc to cover up this policy, this attempt is bound to fail. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, has solemnly pointed out in his statement that the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly actually approves the United States' "policy of prolonging and expanding the Korean War without ceasefire, without negotiation, and without peaceful resolution."

The editorial said that the imperialist aggressors cannot thwart the will of the heroic Korean people. The Pongam Island incident more powerfully demonstrates the great moral strength of the glorious Korean patriots and their spirit of sacrificing themselves for the freedom and independence of their country. Thousands of unarmed people, hand in hand, bravely declared that they belong to the glorious motherland, just as the motherland belongs to them, they refused to accept the unreasonable demands of the aggressors, and demanded repatriation.

The American beasts actually answered these reasonable demands of the Korean patriots with bullets. These bullets only prove that the aggressors are weak, not that they are strong, because the heroic Korean people who have nurtured such strong and loyal sons are invincible, because the people of the world have long believed that the atrocities of the American army in Korea only prove that the American gamble in Korea has suffered a disastrous defeat.

### 苏联《真理报》发表社论  痛斥美国在蜂岩岛虐杀战俘的新罪行

    苏联《真理报》发表社论
    痛斥美国在蜂岩岛虐杀战俘的新罪行
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：《真理报》十七日发表社论，题目是：“美国侵略者在朝鲜的新罪行”。社论说：美国侵略者的暴行是层出不穷的。他们在朝鲜发动了血腥的干涉后，犯下了空前凶恶的暴行，侮辱了人类的良知。
    人们原以为：美国野兽们在巨济岛上对手无寸铁的战俘一次又一次地所犯的暴行，已经做到了尽头。可是仅在几天之前，美国野兽们干出了新的暴行。在蜂岩岛上，美军的罪行远超过了他们在巨济岛上所创造的“纪录”。
    社论在叙述了蜂岩岛上的血腥屠杀事件以后说，美国野兽们正在对被拘留在美国的许多死亡营里的战俘和平民采取血腥的手段。他们罪恶地对待战俘和平民，践踏了国际法的最基本的原则。
    社论指出，杀害、酷刑、大批屠杀——所有这一切只有一个目的，就是威胁战俘，逼迫他们走上背叛他们祖国的道路，把他们编入美国部队参加这场残酷的战争，来打他们自己的亲属、父母、兄弟、姊妹、妻子和孩子。
    蜂岩岛事件再一次有力地暴露了美国统治集团在朝鲜的侵略计划。这个事件暴露了美国将军们在战俘遣返的问题上所使用的愚蠢手段的真正意义。甚至美国弗莱明教授在美国政治社会科学院年刊上发表的一篇文章中也承认，使得战俘问题成为“缔结停战协定的唯一障碍”的，正是美国的立场。
    社论说，美国侵略军在朝鲜所干的史无前例的滔天罪行，已经引起了爱好和平的各国人民的愤怒抗议。全世界各国的千百万善良的人民，一致要求制止美国在朝鲜的侵略。来自各个国家和大陆、代表着不同的种族和民族、抱有不同的政治信仰和宗教信仰的人们，都在维也纳世界人民和平大会的庄严的讲坛上发了言。他们一致要求结束朝鲜战争。美国侵略军在蜂岩岛上又干了新的残酷的暴行，这证明他们完全无意放弃在朝鲜进行血腥的赌博政策。
    全世界人民的良心不能也决不会容忍美国魔鬼的暴行。受战争蹂躏的朝鲜的代表金永顺曾在世界人民和平大会的讲坛上说到一个朝鲜母亲的悲惨景象，这种悲惨景象现在历历呈现在千千万万人的眼前。美国侵略军把婴儿从母亲的怀里硬夺过去，杀死了他，剜掉他的眼睛，还要强迫这位不幸的母亲把这些东西吃下去。这位朝鲜母亲恨透了刽子手们，就向他们扑过去，结果也被杀害了。这位朝鲜母亲的崇高的形象，激励了一切正直的人民积极而坚决地为争取立即停止朝鲜战争而斗争。
    社论说：美国统治者和他们的仆从们假惺惺地叫喊的“自愿遣返”，实际上就是以暴力强迫战俘反对他们自己的人，就是阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的政策，就是继续并扩大对英勇的朝鲜人民的血腥侵略，这一点难道还有人不明白吗？
    如果现在还有人想用美英集团强加于联合国大会的决议来掩饰这种政策，这种企图是一定要失败的。中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来在他的声明中已严正指出，联合国大会所通过的非法决议案，实际上就是批准美国的“不停战、不谈判、也不和平解决的延长并扩大朝鲜战争的政策”。
    社论说，但是帝国主义侵略者是挫折不了英勇的朝鲜人民的意志的。蜂岩岛事件更有力地显示了光荣的朝鲜爱国者的伟大道德力量，和他们不惜为争取国家的自由与独立而牺牲的精神。几千个手无寸铁的人手挽着手，勇敢地声明，他们是属于光荣的祖国的，如同祖国属于他们一样，他们拒绝接受侵略者的无理主张，并要求遣返。
    美国野兽们竟以枪弹来答复这些朝鲜爱国者的合理要求。这种枪弹只证明侵略者是软弱的，而不证明他们是有力量的，因为抚育了这样坚强忠贞的儿子的英勇的朝鲜人民是不可战胜的，因为全世界人民老早就认为美军在朝鲜的暴行只证明美国在朝鲜的赌博已遭到惨败。
