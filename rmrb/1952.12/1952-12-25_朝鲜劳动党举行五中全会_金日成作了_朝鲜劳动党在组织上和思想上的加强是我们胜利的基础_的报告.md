Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held its Fifth Plenary Session in Pyongyang from December 15th to 18th. The meeting was attended by members of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, leading cadres of party organizations and state organs in various provinces, cities, and counties, military cadres of the People's Army, and party activists.

The meeting heard a report by Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, entitled "The Organizational and Ideological Strengthening of the Korean Workers' Party is the Foundation of Our Victory." After a heated discussion of Kim Il-sung's report, the meeting unanimously adopted a corresponding resolution.

The meeting also heard a report on party organizational matters by Park Jung-ai, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, and adopted a corresponding resolution after discussion.

The meeting concluded successfully on the 18th, having achieved great success.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 23rd: Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party entitled "The Organizational and Ideological Strengthening of the Korean Workers' Party is the Foundation of Our Victory."

In his report, Kim Il-sung pointed out: The year since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party in 1951 has been filled with glory due to the great achievements of the Korean people in their sacred and just struggle against the American and Li Seung-man bandits. Over the past year, there have been significant changes in the international and domestic situation. The world democratic camp has become stronger, and the contradictions within the capitalist camp have become more acute. Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as all the documents of the Congress, made a profound analysis of international life, which clearly reflects the events taking place in Korea today.

Kim Il-sung pointed out: The American aggressors have suffered great defeats in the two and a half years of their war of aggression. However, in order to earn huge profits for American billionaires, they are willing to sabotage the armistice negotiations; reject the just proposal put forward by the Soviet Union in the United Nations General Assembly for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue; and insist on prolonging and expanding the Korean War. Now, American generals are planning to use Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek's mercenaries to replace their own troops. There is no doubt that their new attempts are doomed to failure.

Kim Il-sung emphasized: The assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, and other countries to our country, which continues to wage war for three years, is continuing to increase, and our economic relations with these countries have been further consolidated. The freedom-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union, cherish us, the Korean people, and they give us spiritual and material assistance to answer the attempts of American diplomats to isolate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kim Il-sung then spoke about the significant achievements made by the Korean military and civilians in all aspects under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the Republic government over the past year, saying: In the military aspect, the front line has been fixed near the 38th parallel. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have consolidated their positions, repelled the enemy's local offensives, and consumed a large amount of the enemy's manpower and equipment, while the quantity and quality of their own troops have been greatly improved. Under the slogan of "Everything for the victory of the war," the military and civilians throughout the country have overcome many difficulties and established many unprecedented and eternally glorious feats. We have achieved significant achievements in the industrial, transportation, agricultural and other national economic sectors, so we are able to produce the weapons and other military supplies necessary for the People's Army.

Kim Il-sung said: In order to ensure the stability of the currency, our party and government adopted a series of measures in finance and economy in 1952, basically eliminating the deficit in the budget. The stability of the currency has great political and economic significance, promoting the consolidation of the people's democratic system and the improvement of the living standards of the working masses. In terms of industry, the total industrial output in 1952 increased to 119 percent of that in 1951. The output of production cooperatives increased to 118 percent of that in 1951. In terms of commerce, due to the increase in production by the light industry sector and production cooperatives, and the huge assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries, the turnover of retail commodities in 1952 increased to 232 percent of that in 1951. In terms of transportation, our transportation personnel, regardless of the enemy's crazy bombing, victoriously restored destroyed bridges and roads, repaired locomotives and vehicles, and ensured the transportation of goods on schedule. The volume of freight transportation in 1952 increased to 113 percent of that in 1951. In addition, the number of vehicles has also increased a lot. In terms of agriculture, our working farmers, regardless of the enemy's barbaric bombing, produced more grain for our heroic People's Army through their heroic struggle. In 1952, the U.S. imperialists bombed our republic's power stations during the busy farming season, attempting to cut off our power supply to irrigation facilities and starve our people, but our farmers completed spring sowing, rice transplanting, and autumn harvesting ahead of schedule. The total grain output in 1952 increased to 113 percent of that in 1951. This means an increase of 340,000 tons compared to last year, and an increase of 130,000 tons compared to our highest harvest year - 1948. At the same time, state-owned pastures have also begun to develop, and the number of livestock is continuing to increase.

Kim Il-sung said: The achievements made by the people's economy in various sectors of our republic this year have opened up new avenues for the further development of our industry and agriculture in the future. Therefore, in 1953, our total industrial production will increase even more, reaching 123 percent of that in 1952, railway freight transportation will reach 118 percent, total grain output will reach 105 percent, the number of cattle will reach 113.5 percent, and retail commodity circulation will reach 117 percent. There is no doubt that we will also successfully complete these figures next year.

Kim Il-sung pointed out: Due to the aforementioned achievements of the Republic in various sectors of the national economy, the party and government were able to implement a series of measures this year to improve the material life of the working people: exempting poor farmers from the in-kind tax and exempting them from repaying state-granted grain, supplying workers and staff families with subsidized grain at low prices, supplying workers, staff, university and specialized school students with winter clothing, and implementing a free medical treatment system for the working people.

Kim Il-sung continued: As a result of the party and government overcoming many difficulties and taking many measures to improve education, most of the school-age children in the republic are in school, and all the universities established before the war have reopened. The republic established the Academy of Sciences in a war environment to guide all scientific work and research work throughout the country. The republic has also made many achievements in cultural and artistic undertakings and health undertakings.

Kim Il-sung pointed out: Under the brutal rule of the American aggressors and the Li Seung-man bandit gang in South Korea, industry is declining, rice prices are soaring, workers, farmers, and working people are unemployed, bankrupt, displaced, and suicides are increasing in large numbers. The South Korean people cannot bear the brutal rule of the American and Li bandits and are rising up in resistance, and the guerrilla struggle of the South Korean people is expanding day by day.

Kim Il-sung then reported on the rapid growth of the Workers' Party and the significant improvement in the party's organizational work over the past year. Over the past year, the Workers' Party has absorbed hundreds of thousands of outstanding members from workers, soldiers, farmers, and intellectuals into the party. Today, the Workers' Party has become a mass party with more than one million members. The party has become more unified and united organizationally and ideologically. The connection between the party and the masses of people has been strengthened.

Kim Il-sung then pointed out the shortcomings that still exist in the organizational work and ideological work of the Workers' Party and the direction of improvement. He especially emphasized: We must eradicate the phenomenon of underestimating ideological work. He said: Only the improvement and elevation of the party's ideological work can solve all the complex military, political and economic problems of our country.

Kim Il-sung concluded: The international, domestic, and military situations are all beneficial to the Korean people who have risen up to wage a war of liberation of the fatherland against the imperialist aggressors and their lackeys. Let us do everything in our power to consolidate our party in order to win the final victory of the war of liberation of the fatherland.

Kim Il-sung concluded his report amidst the enthusiastic cheers of all those present.

    朝鲜劳动党举行五中全会
    金日成作了“朝鲜劳动党在组织上和思想上的加强是我们胜利的基础”的报告
    【新华社平壤讯】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会于十二月十五日到十八日在平壤市举行了第五次全体会议。出席会议的有：劳动党中央委员；各道、市、郡党组织和国家机关的领导干部；人民军的军事干部和党的积极分子。
    会议听取了劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成的题为“朝鲜劳动党在组织上和思想上的加强是我们胜利的基础”的报告。会议在热烈地讨论了金日成的报告之后，全体一致地通过了相应的决议。
    会议并听取了劳动党中央委员会书记朴正爱的关于党的组织问题的报告，在经过讨论后也通过了相应的决议。
    会议在获得了巨大的成就之后，已于十八日圆满闭幕。
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会第五次全体会议上作了题为“朝鲜劳动党在组织上和思想上的加强是我们胜利的基础”的报告。
    金日成在报告中指出：自一九五一年劳动党中央委员会举行第四次全体会议以来的一年，由于朝鲜人民在反对美李匪帮的神圣、正义的斗争中获得了巨大的成果而充满着光辉。过去一年当中，国际和国内形势都有了很大变化。世界民主阵营更加强大了，资本主义阵营内部的矛盾更加尖锐了。斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和他在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说以及大会的一切文件，对国际生活作了深刻的分析，这种分析清楚地反映了今天在朝鲜发生的事变。
    金日成指出：美国侵略者在两年半的侵略战争中已经遭受了很大失败。但是，他们为了给美国亿万富翁们赚取巨额利润，不惜破坏停战谈判；在联合国大会中拒绝苏联所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的公正提案；坚持延长和扩大朝鲜战争。现在，美国的将军们又计划使用日本和蒋介石的雇佣兵来代替他们自己的军队。毫无疑问，他们的新企图也是一定要失败的。
    金日成强调指出：苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国及其他国家，对继续进行三年战争的我国的援助正在继续增加，我们和这些国家之间的经济关系，已经进一步巩固了。全世界以苏联为首的爱好自由的人民，都爱护我们朝鲜人民，他们给予我们精神的和物质的援助，来回答美国外交家们想孤立朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的企图。
    金日成接着谈到朝鲜军民一年以来在劳动党和共和国政府领导下，在各方面所获得的重大成就说：在军事方面，战线已固定在三八线附近。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军巩固了自己的阵地，击退了敌人的局部攻势，大量消耗了敌人的有生力量和装备，而自己部队的数量和质量则大大提高了。全国军民在“一切为了战争的胜利”的口号下，克服了很多困难，建立了许多史无前例、并将永垂史册的伟大功勋。我们在工业、运输、农业等国民经济部门都获得了显著成就，因此，我们能够生产出人民军队所必需的武器及其他军需物资。
    金日成说：我们党和政府为了保证通货的稳定，
    一九五二年度在财政、经济方面采取了一系列的措施，基本上肃清了预算中的赤字。通货的稳定，具有巨大的政治的和经济的意义，它促进了人民民主制度的巩固和劳动群众生活水平的上升。工业方面，一九五二年的工业总产量增加到一九五一年的百分之一百一十九。生产合作社的产量增加到一九五一年的百分之一百一十八。商业方面，由于轻工业部门和生产合作社生产的增加，苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的巨大援助，一九五二年度零售商品的流通额增加到了一九五一年的百分之二百三十二。运输方面，我们的运输人员不顾敌人疯狂的轰炸，胜利地恢复被破坏的桥梁和道路，修理机车和车辆，按期地保证着货物的运输。一九五二年度的货物运输量增加到一九五一年的百分之一百一十三。另外，车辆的数量也增加很多。农业方面，我们的劳动农民们不顾敌人的野蛮轰炸，以自己的英雄斗争为我们英勇的人民军队生产了更多的粮食。美帝国主义者在一九五二年度农忙期，轰炸了我们共和国的发电站，企图切断我们对灌溉设施的电力供应，使我国人民陷于饥饿，但是我们的农民们却提前完成了春季播种、插秧和秋收。一九五二年度谷物的总产量增加到一九五一年度的百分之一百一十三。这意味着比去年增产了三十四万吨，比我国最高收获年度——一九四八年增产了十三万吨。与此同时，国营牧场也开始发展，家畜的头数也在继续增加着。
    金日成说：我们共和国各部门的人民经济在今年度所获得的成果，给我们的工业和农业今后的进一步发展打开了新的道路。因此，一九五三年度我们的产业的总生产量将更为增加，达到一九五二年度的百分之一百二十三，铁路的货物运输量将达到百分之一百一十八，谷物总产量将达到百分之一百零五，牛的头数将达到百分之一百一十三点五，零售商品流通量将达到百分之一百一十七。我们下一年的这些数字也将同样胜利地完成，这是无可置疑的。
    金日成指出：由于共和国在国民经济各部门获得上述成就，党和政府得以在今年实施改善劳动人民物质生活的一系列的措施：免征贫农的现物税并免还国家贷予的粮食，以低价供给工人、职员家属以补助粮，对工人、职员、大学和专门学校的学生供给冬季服装，及对劳动人民实行免费治疗制度等。
    金日成接着说：党和政府克服了很多困难，采取了许多改善教育事业的措施的结果，共和国的学龄儿童大部分都在就学，战前所设立的各个大学全部开学了。共和国在战争环境中成立了指导全国一切科学工作和研究工作的科学院。共和国在文化艺术事业和保健事业方面，也取得了许多成就。
    金日成指出：南朝鲜在美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮的暴虐统治下，产业凋敝，米价腾贵，工农劳动人民失业、破产、流离失所，自杀者大量增加。南朝鲜人民不堪美李匪帮的暴虐统治，正在奋起反抗，南朝鲜人民的游击斗争，正在日益扩大。
    金日成接着报告一年以来劳动党的组织迅速壮大、党的组织工作获得显著改善的情况。一年以来，劳动党吸收了工人、军人、农民和知识分子中的优秀分子数十万人入党，今天，劳动党已成为拥有一百多万党员的群众性的政党了。党在组织上和思想上更加统一和团结了。党和人民群众的联系加强了。
    金日成接着在报告中指出了劳动党在组织工作中和思想工作中尚存的缺点以及改进的方向。他特别强调说：我们要根除对思想工作过低估价的现象。他说：只有党的思想工作的改进和提高，才能解决我们国家的一切复杂的军事、政治和经济的问题。
    金日成最后说：国际的、国内的和军事的形势都有利于为反对帝国主义侵略者及其走狗而奋起进行祖国解放战争的朝鲜人民，让我们为争取祖国解放战争的最后胜利而尽一切力量来巩固我们的党吧。
    金日成在全体到会者热烈的欢呼声中结束他的报告。
