Strengthening the links and collaboration between light industry and other economic sectors
Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, Ji Chongwei

Modern industry carries out production activities jointly through various means of mutual connection and combination. Taking light industry as an example: its machinery and equipment need to be manufactured by heavy industry and the machinery industry; power and fuel need to be supplied by power plants and coal mines; raw materials need to rely on agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, mining industry, heavy industry and other production departments to supply them. The uses of light industrial products, in addition to directly supplying the needs of people's consumption, also produce some means of production to supply other industrial, mining, transportation and transportation departments as raw materials, materials, parts, etc. Therefore, the connection and cooperation between light industry and various sectors of the national economy is extremely close.

Our country is currently in a transitional period of gradually transitioning to a socialist society, and we must realize the task of national socialist industrialization. The old economic foundations of industry and agriculture, as well as the old proportional relationships and collaborative connections between industrial sectors, can no longer adapt to the requirements of the development of productive forces. For example, in recent years, the production of the cigarette industry has developed, and the supply of tobacco leaves has become out of sync in terms of grade, quantity, and proportion (there was a shortage of high-grade tobacco leaves last year, and there is a shortage of both high-grade and low-grade tobacco leaves this year). This requires the agricultural sector to change the old tobacco leaf grade planting ratio and increase the production of high-grade and low-grade tobacco leaves. There are similar situations between industrial sectors. For example, the development of the chemical pharmaceutical industry requires hundreds of chemical raw materials, many of which have never been produced in China in the past. When the production scale is small, it can be solved by importing or manufacturing a small amount, but after the scale expands, the chemical industry must establish new factories or workshops to supply them. Without adapting to the development of the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry will find it difficult to move forward. For example, the production of an X-ray diagnostic machine requires more than two thousand parts, which must be produced in collaboration with the electrical, machinery, metal processing, optical instrument, glass, and rubber industries. Conversely, the establishment of these new products or new industrial sectors puts forward many new requirements to the industrial sector. For example, after the establishment of the automobile industry, it requires the rubber industry to produce a large number of tires and more than 80 new rubber accessories and sundries. At the same time, it also requires the paper industry to supply several special-performance papers and paperboards. If a certain link in these objectively existing proportions and cooperation relationships is disconnected and falls behind, it will hinder the development and improvement of the productive forces of other parts.

Although coordination and cooperation in social production activities are so important, due to the complexity of China's economic situation and the fact that economic construction has just begun, everyone lacks sufficient understanding of the laws of industrial development and its internal connections and proportional relationships, and there is no complete experience in mutual cooperation and coordination. The division of labor and specialization of responsibilities between the production departments is not completely clear, and the departments are busy grasping their main central tasks. Therefore, the collaborative and cooperative relationships between the economic sectors cannot meet the objective requirements, and there are many disconnections. From the scope of the light industry sector, on the one hand, we have not done enough to actively contact other departments to request cooperation. For example, we have not systematically discussed the manufacturing of various professional machinery and equipment with the First Ministry of Machine Building, and we have not studied with the Ministry of Heavy Industry how the development of heavy chemical industry can meet the needs of light industry. On the other hand, some relevant departments also have some objective difficulties, or do not pay enough attention to cooperation. For example, some raw materials needed by light industry (especially chemical raw materials) are not difficult to solve in terms of resources, technology, and production conditions, but they have not been solved for a long time. This situation has also contributed to the idea and practice of "relying on oneself for everything and not asking for help from anyone" among some comrades in the light industry sector. For example, in order to supply the needs of the paper industry, we have mined pyrite mines ourselves, cultivated reeds ourselves, and produced copper mesh ourselves. We have also planned to cultivate forests and bamboo forests ourselves, and build paper machine factories ourselves. Several newly built paper mills have to build their own power plants and set up electrolysis workshops to supply chemical raw materials such as caustic soda and chlorine gas. Obviously, this approach is not in line with the principle of division of labor, specialization, cooperation and coordination in the national economy.

In order to avoid the continued existence and development of the above situation, in the past one or two years, we have continuously requested other departments to cooperate, and have also received a lot of support and assistance from relevant departments. For example, at the end of last year, the two pyrite mines under the Ministry of Light Industry have been transferred to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which will guarantee the supply of pyrite ore for the state-owned paper mills. The tire cord workshops of the three rubber factories were transferred to the Ministry of Textile Industry, which will supply the tire cord needed by the rubber factories. The calcium carbonate plant (rubber industry ingredients) in the Northeast was transferred to the local industrial sector. On the other hand, we have also shouldered the collaborative responsibilities that we should fulfill to other departments. For example, we are actively planning to produce and supply rubber tires and accessories needed for the establishment of new automobile factories, and develop the production of by-products of edible salt, such as mirabilite, anhydrous sodium sulfate, bittern, potassium chloride, borax, bromine, etc., to meet the needs of chemical, non-ferrous metal, glass enamel and other industrial sectors. These measures are in line with the principles of division of labor and cooperation and the overall interests of the national economy.

However, the links and cooperation between the various departments of the national economy are intricate. In the process of industrial construction, various kinds of cooperation are needed in many aspects. Some problems have been solved, some problems still exist; some problems have just arisen or have not been discovered. As our planning is gradually strengthened, we will discover more and more problems that need to be coordinated and cooperated between departments. If these problems are not resolved through mutual contact and coordination when formulating plans, then great disconnections and loopholes will inevitably occur in the process of practice, thereby affecting the smooth progress of the entire production and construction. Therefore, in the process of compiling the plan, according to the instructions of the higher authorities to strengthen cooperation and coordination between departments, we have adopted the following methods:

First, check which items and problems in the plan require cooperation and coordination from other departments? Put forward specific requirements and send a detailed list to relevant departments for research and consideration.

Second, hold cooperation meetings, invite relevant departments to participate, put forward our cooperation requirements, and also ask the other party to put forward cooperation requirements to us, and discuss solutions together. This kind of meeting is beneficial for exchanging opinions in a wider range when making initial contact with each other. However, both parties must prepare in advance, and responsible comrades who are familiar with the situation should participate.

Third, assign special personnel to visit relevant departments, put forward cooperative matters and discuss solutions. The more important or difficult problems need to be studied and resolved by the responsible comrades of both parties.

Fourth, for a specific problem that involves several departments and requires a considerable period of time for joint in-depth and meticulous research, or matters that require frequent contact and cooperation, a special working group should be established for research, convened by the main production department. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building established a professional group to undertake the task of manufacturing sugar factory machinery and equipment, and convened relevant bureaus of the ministry and the Ministry of Light Industry to participate.

Fifth, if some problems cannot be resolved through mutual consultation between the two departments and an agreement cannot be reached, they should be reported to the higher authorities for consideration and decision.

Through the above methods, we have greatly strengthened the contact and cooperation with relevant departments in the recent period, and reached agreements on joint cooperation in several important aspects, thus making up for many loopholes in the plan, and revised the plan based on the results of the cooperation, making it based on a more practical and reliable basis; at the same time, it has enabled us to learn more about the situation of relevant economic departments and their future development guidelines and intentions, so that we can better cooperate with other departments in future plans to achieve development. Our initial gains are:

First, the collaborative relationship has been developed, and many problems in the long-term plan of supply, production, sales and capital construction have been solved, thus creating favorable conditions for developing production and giving play to potential. For example, as a result of cooperation, the Ministry of Fuel Industry expanded the construction scale of carbon black plants, providing a guarantee for the supply of important raw materials necessary for the development of the rubber industry. The Petroleum Administration promised to help us drill salt wells in Sichuan, which will also make a great contribution to expanding the supply of edible salt to the people of the Southwest and developing the production of by-products of edible salt. The Ministry of Light Industry will supply the Ministry of Fuel Industry with thin chuan paper for packaging mountain explosives, large automobile tires for transporting petroleum eastward, and furfural, a refining agent for refining petroleum. The Ministry of Textile Industry will establish a special factory to supply tire cord for tires, and the Ministry of Light Industry is preparing to supply it with raw material pulp for manufacturing rayon. The First Ministry of Machine Building plans to undertake the manufacture of complete sets of machinery and equipment required for the construction of paper making, sugar making and other industries, and the Ministry of Light Industry will supply it with insulating paper for manufacturing motors and cables, and rubber accessories for manufacturing automobiles and tractors. The Second Ministry of Machine Building has agreed to trial-produce the main component of X-ray machines, the X-ray tube, which provides favorable conditions for the mass production of X-ray machines in China. The production plans of agricultural economic crops such as tobacco leaves, sugar cane, sugar beets, and oilseeds of the Ministry of Agriculture have also basically been coordinated with the long-term plans of light industry. Within the state-owned light industry, it is also promoting the cooperation and coordination between various specialized bureaus and enterprises. For example, it is planned to build a pulp mill to utilize the bagasse of sugar mills, and to designate the machinery factory of the Shanghai Tobacco and Wine Bureau to undertake the production of some machinery and equipment and medical equipment for the pharmaceutical industry. The solution of these important cooperation problems has strongly supported and promoted the progress of the national construction cause.

Second, through the contact and cooperation and organizational role of the plan with all parties, we discovered shortcomings and made up for loopholes, so that the plan was based on a more reliable basis. For example, the Ministry of Light Industry originally planned to cooperate with a state-owned farm in a certain place to build a milk powder factory. After studying with the Ministry of Agriculture, it was learned that the farm's dairy cattle management policy and development plan were not easy to adapt to the milk powder factory, so the original plan was revised. At the same time, in the work of contact and cooperation with other departments, we learned about the actual situation of the relevant economic departments and their development guidelines and plans, so that we can actively cooperate in our work. For example, we know the distribution of the power grid in the future, and when choosing new factory sites, we try to consider building them in locations with abundant power supply. Knowing the Ministry of Agriculture's development policy for animal husbandry, we can consider the construction plan of the milk powder industry. Knowing the needs of various industrial sectors for special paper and rubber accessories, we can plan to conduct research, specialize the existing factories, and strengthen the research and development of new products, so as not to be passive when needed in the future. In this way, we can broaden our horizons when making plans, strengthen our foresight, and take care of needs and possibilities when considering problems. The partial plan is connected and combined with the overall plan, which is more in line with the law of proportionate development of the socialist economy, and the reality and reliability of the plan is greater.

Third, in the work of cooperation and coordination, our socialist ideology has also been improved, and we have a deeper understanding of the Marxist-Leninist principle of mutual influence and mutual connection in social production activities. We have realized that the process of socialist industrialization cannot be an isolated development in which a certain department stands out, but must be developed and improved correspondingly with heavy industry as the center. If a certain link is backward and disconnected, it will affect the overall development, and it will affect the completion of the overall task of the transition period. After the education of cooperative facts, the isolationist thinking of "sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door, regardless of the frost on other people's roofs" and the all-inclusive approach of "not asking for help from anyone and relying on oneself for everything" have been gradually criticized, and the overall concept and socialist mutual assistance and cooperation spirit of starting from the national interest have been gradually established and strengthened.

From the work in this recent period, we feel that to do a good job in cooperation, we must pay attention to the following points:

First, we must have an active and fearless spirit of trouble. There are many intricate things that need to be contacted and coordinated in the industry. We must contact other departments with an active spirit. If there is no result once, we must negotiate again and again without fear of trouble. For important cooperation issues, leading comrades at all levels should personally come forward to solve them more properly.

Second, we must have an overall concept and a global perspective. Each unit and department should regard the cooperation requirements of other units and departments as the requirements of the overall national interest and as its own responsibility, and undertake them without hesitation. Of course, each department has its focus of work, and cannot do everything well at once, but if these things are indeed within its own scope of responsibility, it will be responsible for them sooner or later. If the current conditions are not sufficient and the strength is insufficient, it must create conditions and increase strength, and use various methods to overcome difficulties. If it is indeed impossible to solve for a while, it is necessary to sincerely explain the reasons for not being able to solve it to the other party, and determine the time and steps for solving it, so that the other party can change the plan or seek other solutions.

Third, establish a certain organization and system. Several departments with close cooperative relationships can establish a regular meeting system, or set up a special working group on a certain issue, so as to conduct regular and in-depth research on specific issues in cooperation. Some departments that need to conduct technical cooperation (such as manufacturing a new type of professional machinery and equipment, which requires the technical personnel of the production unit, the ordering unit, and the design unit to jointly design, draw, and research and trial-produce) can establish a certain technical cooperation system. The most important thing is: all cooperative matters must be included in each other's plans, and fixed with written agreements or contracts, and made specific, as each other's obligation to fulfill. If there is a change in the plan, the other party must be notified and obtain its consent to modify the agreement contract. Last year, the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory relied on thiourea and liquid chlorine supplied by the Shenyang Chemical Plant. Because no contract was signed, the supply was interrupted due to the other party's change in production. As a result, sulfathiazole and DDT were forced to stop production for more than a month.

Fourth, strengthen the organization and guidance role of the national plan in cooperation. Leadership organizations at all levels should specifically assist the coordination and cooperation between departments and units, and eliminate some uncooperative and uncoordinated phenomena. In the past, in actual work, we felt that there were two shortcomings: first, various departments were unwilling to consult with each other on problems, and pushed the responsibility upwards, asking the higher authorities to solve them. On the other hand, higher-level agencies sometimes refuse to be responsible for handling more difficult problems. Instead, the method of accommodating or reconciling is used to delay the matter. This not only weakened everyone's initiative and sense of responsibility for coordination and cooperation, but also wasted time and energy, and easily delayed work, causing national losses. Therefore, we feel that if there is a problem, the departments and units themselves should first contact and negotiate. If the problem cannot be solved, it should be raised to the higher-level agency. Based on an in-depth analysis of the specific situation, judge which factors are ideological problems and which factors are practical difficulties, and weigh and consider them from a comprehensive and overall perspective. , make correct handling decisions. The content of cooperation should also be expressed in the form of planned tasks, so that the work of all parties can be carried out in harmony under the unified planned leadership of the country.

Although we have strengthened the cooperation and coordination with various departments recently, there are still many shortcomings in our work, and many problems have only been initially communicated, and have not been specific and in-depth. The remaining biases of departmentalism and isolationism have not been completely overcome. The cooperation and coordination work within the state-owned light industry system is also very insufficient. In order to improve this work, we must strengthen the study of the country's overall tasks during the transition period and the theory of Soviet economic construction, improve socialist awareness and the spirit of overall concept and cooperation, maintain close contact and cooperation with all parties, frequently check the internal and external links and cooperation links in the plan, and more actively and meticulously promote and solve cooperation problems in all aspects, so that cooperation and coordination become a loophole-free part of the plan and an indispensable habit in our work. This will greatly improve our economic work and ideological work, and complete the production and construction tasks of developing production and meeting needs.

    加强轻工业和其他经济部门的联系和协作
    中央轻工业部计划司副司长　季崇威
    现代工业是通过各种各样方式互相联系和结合起来共同进行生产活动的，拿轻工业来说：它的机器设备需要重工业和机器工业制造出来；动力和燃料需要发电厂及煤矿供应；原材料更要倚靠农业、林业、畜牧业、采掘工业、重工业和其他的生产部门来供给。轻工业产品的用途，除了大部分直接供应人民消费的需要外，还生产部分的生产资料来供应其他工矿、交通、运输部门作为原料、材料、配件等用途。因此轻工业与国民经济各部门间的联系与配合是异常密切的。
    我们国家目前正处在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的过渡时期，我们必须实现国家社会主义工业化的任务。在旧的经济基础上的工业与农业，以及工业各部门间旧的比例关系和协作联系方式，已不能适应生产力发展的要求。例如这几年卷烟工业生产发展了，烟叶的供应在品级数量比例上就发生了脱节现象（去年高级烟叶缺乏，今年高级低级烟叶都缺），这就要求农业部门改变老的烟叶品级种植比例，增产高级和低级烟叶。在工业部门之间，也有类似情况，例如化学制药工业的发展，需要数百种化学原料，其中不少是国内过去从未生产的，生产规模较小时，还可用部分进口或小量制造的办法解决，规模扩大后，就要化学工业建立新的工厂或车间才能供应。不与化学工业的发展相适应，制药工业是很难前进的。又如生产一架X光诊疗机，需要二千多种零件，必须电工、机器、金属加工、光学仪器、玻璃、橡胶等各工业部门协作生产才能制造出来。反过来这些新的产品或新的工业部门的建立，又向工业部门提出许多新的要求，例如汽车工业建立后，就要求橡胶工业生产大量的轮胎和八十多种新的橡胶配件杂品，同时还要求造纸工业供应若干特种性能的纸和纸板。在这些客观存在的比例和配合关系中，如果有某一环节发生脱节和落后，就会阻碍其他部分生产力的发展和提高。
    在社会生产活动中的配合与协作虽如此重要，但是由于我国经济情况的复杂，经济建设的工作又刚刚开始，大家对工业发展的规律及其内部联系、比例关系，都缺乏足够的认识，对相互间的协作配合也没有完整的经验，各生产部门间的分工专责还不完全明确，各部门又忙着抓住自己主要的中心任务，因此在各经济部门间的协作配合关系上，还不能符合客观的要求，存在着不少的脱节现象。从轻工业部门的范围中来看，一方面我们过去主动向其他部门联系请求协作的工作做得不够，例如没有系统地与第一机械工业部商谈各种专业机器设备的制造问题，没有与重工业部研究重化学工业的发展如何配合轻工业的需要问题。另方面某些有关部门在客观上也存在些困难，或对协作的重视程度不够。例如轻工业所需要的若干原材料（特别是化学原料）在资源、技术、生产等条件上本来是不难解决的，但却长期的得不到解决。这种情况，也助长了轻工业部门某些同志中“一切靠自己，万事不求人”的想法与做法。例如为了供应造纸工业的需要，我们曾自己开采硫化铁矿，自己培植芦苇，生产铜网，还曾计划过自己来培植森林、竹林，自己建立造纸机器厂。若干新建的纸厂，要自己建立发电厂，自己设立电解车间，以供应烧碱、氯气等化学原料。这样发展下去，造纸工业就将成为包括农、林、采矿、动力、机械、化学工业等生产种类庞杂、无所不包的一个独立经济体系。显然，这样的做法，是不合乎国民经济分工专责协作配合的原则的。
    为了避免以上情况继续存在和发展，在过去一、二年来，我们曾不断地要求其他部门配合协作，也得到有关部门的不少支持和协助，例如去年年底，轻工业部辖属的二个硫化铁矿已移交给重工业部，由他们保证供应国营造纸厂的硫化铁矿石。将三个橡胶厂的帘子布车间移交给纺织工业部，由他们供应橡胶厂轮胎所需要的帘子布。又把东北的炭酸钙厂（橡胶工业用配料）移交给地方工业部门。另一方面，我们也负起了对其他部门应尽的协作职责。例如积极筹划生产供应新汽车厂建立后所需的橡胶轮胎及配件，发展食盐的副产品生产，如芒硝、无水硝、卤块、氯化钾、硼砂、溴素等，以供应化工、有色金属、玻璃搪瓷等工业部门的需要，这些措施都是符合于分工协作的原则和国民经济整体利益的。
    但是国民经济各部门的联系配合是千丝万缕的。在工业建设的过程中，需要多方面的各种各样的协作，有些问题已经解决了，有些问题还存在着；有些问题刚刚产生或还没有发现。随着我们计划性的逐步加强，对于各部门需要配合和协作的问题也就发现得愈多，这些问题，如果不在制订计划时即相互联系配合得到解决，则在实践过程中必然会发生很大的脱节和漏洞，从而影响到整个生产建设的顺利进行。因此，我们在编制计划过程中，根据上级加强各部门间协作配合的指示，曾采取了下列各项办法：
    一、首先检查计划中有哪些事项哪些问题需要其他部门协作配合的？提出具体的要求，开出详细清单送交有关部门研究考虑。
    二、召开协作会议，邀请有关部门参加，提出我们的协作要求，同时也请对方提出对我们的协作要求，共同商讨解决办法。这种会议对于彼此初步接触时，在较广泛的范围内交换意见是有好处的。但事先必须双方都作准备，并应有熟悉情况的负责同志参加。
    三、指派专人访问有关部门，提出协作事项商量解决，其中比较重大的或存在困难的问题，则需要双方的负责同志共同研究解决。
    四、对某一专门问题，关系到几个部门，需要经过相当时间共同深入细致研究，或需要经常联系配合的事项，则成立一专门小组研究，由主要的生产部门召集，例如第一机械工业部为了承担制造糖厂机器设备的任务，就成立了一个专业小组，召集该部有关各局及轻工业部参加。
    五、有些问题，两个部门相互协商得不到解决，无法取得协议时，则报请上级机关考虑决定。
    通过了上述方式方法，我们在最近一个时期中，大大加强了与有关部门的联系配合，在若干重要方面取得了共同协作的协议，因此弥补了计划中的许多漏洞，并根据配合的结果修正了计划，使其建立在更切实可靠的基础上；同时使我们更多地了解到有关经济部门的情况及今后发展的方针意图，从而在今后的计划中，可更好地与其他部门取得配合发展。我们的初步收获是：
    一、发展了协作关系，解决了长期计划中供产销及基本建设中的许多问题，从而为发展生产发挥潜力，创造了有利条件。例如由于协作的结果，燃料工业部扩大了炭黑厂的建设规模，为供应橡胶工业发展所必需的重要原料提供了保证。石油管理局答应帮助我们钻凿四川的盐井，对扩大供应西南人民食盐及发展食盐副产品生产也有很大的贡献。轻工业部对燃料工业部则将供应其包装矿山炸药的细川纸，载运石油东运的大型汽车轮胎，提炼石油用的精制剂糠醛等。纺织工业部为供应轮胎用帘子布，将专门建立一个工厂，轻工业部则准备供应它制造人造丝的原料纸浆。第一机械工业部计划承制造纸、制糖等工业建设所需要的整套机器设备，轻工业部则供应它制造电机，电缆用的绝缘纸，及制造汽车和拖拉机的橡胶配件等。第二机械工业部同意为我们试制生产爱克斯光机所必需的主要部件爱克斯光管，这就为国内大量制造爱克斯光机提供了有利的条件。农业部烟叶、甘蔗、甜菜、油料等经济作物的生产计划基本上也与轻工业的长期计划取得了配合。在国营轻工业内部，也正促进着各专业局及各企业间的协作配合，例如计划建立纸浆厂来利用糖厂的蔗渣，指定烟酒局上海的机械厂承制医药工业的部分机器设备和医疗器械，这些重要协作问题的解决，都有力地支援和推动着国家建设事业的前进。
    二、通过了计划与各方面的联系配合和组织作用，发现缺点，弥补漏洞，使计划建立在更可靠的基础上。例如轻工业部原来计划与某地国营农场配合建设一个奶粉厂，与农业部研究后，知道该农场的奶牛经营方针和发展计划与奶粉厂不易适应，因此修改了原定的计划。同时在与其他部门的联系配合工作中，使我们了解了有关经济部门的实际情况及其发展的方针、计划，自己的工作便可主动地加以配合。例如我们知道了今后电力网的分布情况，在选择新建厂址时就尽可能考虑在电源充裕的地点建设。知道了农业部对畜牧事业的发展方针，就可以考虑奶粉工业的建设计划。了解了各工业部门对于特种纸和橡胶配件的需要，就可有计划地进行研究，将现有工厂分工专业，并加强新产品试验研究工作，以免将来需要时被动。这样，就使我们在订计划时扩大了眼界，加强了预见性，在考虑问题时能照顾到需要与可能，部分的计划与整体的计划衔接结合，就更符合于社会主义经济按比例发展的规律，计划现实性和可靠性也就更大。
    三、在协作配合工作中也提高了我们的社会主义思想，更深刻地认识到马克思列宁主义关于社会生产活动互相影响互相联系的原理，认识到社会主义工业化的过程不能是某一部门突出的孤立的发展，而要以重工业为中心相应地发展与提高，如果某一环节落后与脱节，就会影响到整体的发展，就要影响到过渡时期总任务的完成。经过协作事实的教育，那种“只扫门前雪，不管他人瓦上霜”的孤立思想，和“万事不求人，一切靠自己”的一揽子做法已逐步受到批判，从国家利益出发的整体观念和社会主义互助协作精神则逐渐地树立和加强了。
    从最近这一时期的工作中，我们感到要把协作做好，须注意下列几点：
    一、要有主动和不怕麻烦的精神。工业中各种需要联系和配合的事情是繁细的，必须以主动精神和其他部门联系，如果一次没有结果，就要不怕麻烦地一而再，再而三的进行洽商。重要的协作问题，应由各级领导同志亲自出马，才能更妥善地得到解决。
    二、要有整体观念，全局观点，每一单位和部门都应把其他单位部门对自己的协作要求，看成国家整体利益的要求，看成自己应尽的责任，毫不推诿地承担下来。当然各个部门有其工作的重点，不能一下子把什么好事都做完，但如果这些事情的确是属于自己的职责范围，则迟早都要自己负责，目前条件不够，力量不足，就要创造条件，增长力量，用各种方法克服困难。如果的确一时不能解决，也要与对方诚恳说明不能解决的原因理由，确定解决的时间与步骤，以便对方改变计划或另谋解决的途径。
    三、建立一定的组织和制度。协作关系密切的几个部门，可建立经常的会议制度，或就某一问题成立专门的小组，以便经常而深入地研究协作中的具体问题。有些部门需进行技术合作的，（如制造某种新式专业机器设备，需由生产单位，订货单位，设计单位的技术人员共同合作来设计绘图研究试制）可订立一定的技术合作制度。最重要的是：一切协作的事项，一定要列入彼此的计划中去，并用书面的协议或合同将它固定下来，加以具体化，作为彼此的义务履行。如果计划有变动，必须通知对方并取得其同意修改协议合同。去年东北制药厂依靠沈阳化工厂供应的硫尿和液氯，由于没有签订合同，就曾因对方改变生产而中断供应，结果磺胺噻唑和滴滴涕都被迫停产一个多月。
    四、加强国家计划对协作的组织与指导作用，各级领导机构要具体协助各部门各单位间的配合与协作，消除某些不协作不配合的现象。过去在实际工作中，我们感到有两个缺点：一是各个部门间有问题不愿彼此协商，都把责任向上推，要求上级解决。另方面是上级机关遇到较棘手的问题，有时也不肯负责处理。而用迁就或调和的办法拖拉下去。这样不仅削弱了大家对于配合协作的主动性和责任心，而且浪费时间精力，并易耽误工作，造成国家损失。所以我们觉得有问题首先要各部门各单位自己联系协商，不能解决的再提到上级机关，根据对具体情况的深入分析，判断那些因素是思想问题，那些因素是实际困难，从全面整体观点，加以衡量考虑，正确的处理决定。并将协作的内容用计划任务的形式表现出来，这样各个方面的工作才能在国家统一的计划领导下合拍地进行。
    最近以来，我们虽已加强了与各部门间的配合协作，但在工作中还存在着许多缺点，有很多问题还仅仅初步沟通，没有做到具体深入，本位主义、孤立观点的残余偏向还没有完全克服。在国营轻工业系统内部，配合协作工作也做得很不够。为了改进这一工作，就必须加强对国家在过渡时期总任务和苏联经济建设理论的学习，提高社会主义觉悟和整体观念协作精神，与各方面密切联系配合，经常检查计划中的内外衔接和配合环节，更主动更细致地来推动和解决各方面的协作问题，使协作配合成为计划中没有漏洞的部分，成为我们工作中不可缺少的习惯，这样就能大大提高我们经济工作和思想工作的水平，完成发展生产，满足需要的生产建设任务。
