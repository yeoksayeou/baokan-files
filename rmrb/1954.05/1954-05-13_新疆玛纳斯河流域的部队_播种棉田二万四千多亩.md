The troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Manas River Basin, which are participating in agricultural production, have completed the sowing of more than 24,000 mu of cotton fields. Because the tractor operators and the soldiers who mastered the horse-drawn seeders underwent technical training before the spring sowing and were skilled in operation, the entire sowing time was shortened by eight to ten days compared to last year. This will reduce frost damage and improve the yield and quality of cotton.

This year, the agricultural production troops aim to harvest an average of 600 jin or more of seed cotton per mu on more than 13,000 mu of cotton fields, which is about five times higher than the average yield per mu of cotton fields in Xinjiang Province. The remaining more than 11,000 mu of cotton fields should also yield more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu.

In order to ensure high yields over a large area, advanced Soviet cotton planting methods have been widely adopted by the troops this year. All of the more than 300,000 jin of high-quality Soviet "C3-173" cotton seeds sown this year have been selected by grain size and treated with pesticides, and some have also undergone vernalization.

During the sowing period, Professor Titov of Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, Soviet agronomists, and more than 200 teachers and students from the Agricultural College went deep into the fields to help and guide cotton planting work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆玛纳斯河流域的部队
    播种棉田二万四千多亩
    人民解放军新疆军区驻玛纳斯河流域参加农业生产的部队的二万四千多亩棉田，已经完成播种。由于拖拉机手和掌握马拉播种机的战士在春播前经过了技术训练，操作熟练，使整个播种时间比去年缩短了八天到十天。这样就可减少霜后花，提高棉花的产量和质量。
    今年农业生产部队要在一万三千多亩棉田上平均每亩收籽花六百斤以上，高出新疆省棉田每亩平均产量五倍左右。其余一万一千多亩棉田每亩也要收籽棉四百斤以上。
    为了保证获得大面积的高额产量，今年部队广泛地采用了苏联先进的植棉方法。今年下种的三十多万斤苏联“斯三一七三”优良棉籽，全部经过粒选并用药剂拌种，其中一部分还作了春化处理。
