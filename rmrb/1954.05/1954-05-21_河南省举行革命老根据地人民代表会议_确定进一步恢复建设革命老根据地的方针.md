Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, May 20th: Henan Province held a People's Representative Conference of Old Revolutionary Base Areas from May 2nd to 11th, determining the future policy and tasks for further restoring and constructing old revolutionary base areas.

In recent years, the restoration and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas of Henan Province has achieved great results. Agricultural production has largely recovered or exceeded pre-war levels, and the people's material and cultural lives have improved to some extent. For example, in Wangpu and Xinqiao townships of Shangcheng County, the old revolutionary base area of ​​the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region, the average yield of rice per mu increased from 358 jin in 1946 to 402 jin in 1953. Xin County now has ten times more primary school students than in 1950. However, in a few areas, due to the severe devastation suffered during the war and natural disasters such as droughts and floods, the people still face many difficulties in production and life. Based on the above situation, the conference determined that the future policy for the restoration and construction of old revolutionary base areas is: to continue to deeply publicize and implement the general task of the state during the transition period, to further raise the socialist consciousness of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, to fully carry forward the revolutionary tradition, to help solve urgent problems and difficulties, to vigorously develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and to improve agricultural productivity, and to complete agricultural production increase plans. On the basis of developing production, the material and cultural living standards of the people in the old revolutionary base areas will be improved. In order to implement this policy, it is first necessary to carry out an agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in various old revolutionary base areas; attention should be paid to organizing handicraft and sideline production, and carrying out material exchanges; restoring cultural, educational and health undertakings, developing primary school education, and deciding to allocate a portion of medical subsidies and medicines to the people in old areas. In addition, good work should be done in preferential treatment and land cultivation on behalf of soldiers' families. For areas with difficulties in carrying out restoration work, the decision was made to provide focused support and care. In 1954, the People's Government will allocate 10 billion yuan to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers' families in these areas purchase draught animals and farm tools, and support them in participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations; it will also allocate tens of billions of yuan to help the people in these areas build houses, school buildings, and health centers, build roads and reservoirs, and help the masses repair ponds and dredge ditches.

The old revolutionary base areas of Henan Province are distributed in more than 6,900 townships in 74 counties of the province. The population is 7.85 million, accounting for 17.8 percent of the province's total population. There were 433 representatives attending this conference. At the meeting, in addition to listening to and discussing the "Opinions on the Economic Recovery Situation and Future Construction of Old Base Areas in Henan Province" by Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and the report on mutual aid and cooperation by Shi Xiangsheng, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the representatives also exchanged experiences in carrying out various production and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas, and visited factories. They expressed one after another: After returning, they will carefully convey the spirit of this meeting to the people in the old revolutionary base areas, and are determined to lead the masses to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory in future construction undertakings.

    河南省举行革命老根据地人民代表会议
    确定进一步恢复建设革命老根据地的方针
    【新华社开封二十日电】河南省在五月二日到十一日举行革命老根据地人民代表会议，确定了今后进一步恢复和建设革命老根据地的方针、任务。
    几年来，河南省革命老根据地的恢复建设工作已获得很大成绩。农业生产大部已恢复或超过战前水平，人民的物质和文化生活已有所改善。如鄂豫皖革命老根据地的商城县汪铺、新桥两乡，一九四六年每亩平均产稻谷三百五十八斤，一九五三年提高到四百零二斤。新县现有小学学生比一九五零年增加十倍。但少数地区因为战争中受敌人摧残较重，加以旱、涝等自然灾害，人民生产、生活方面的困难仍多。会议根据以上情况，确定了今后革命老根据地的恢复建设方针是：继续深入宣传贯彻国家在过渡时期的总任务，进一步提高革命老根据地人民的社会主义觉悟，充分发扬革命传统，帮助解决急需解决的问题和困难，大力开展互助合作运动，提高农业生产力，完成农业增产计划。在发展生产的基础上，提高革命老根据地人民的物质、文化生活水平。为贯彻这一方针，首先要在各革命老根据地开展以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动；注意组织手工业和副业生产，开展物资交流；恢复文教卫生事业，发展小学教育，并决定拨给老区人民一部分医疗补足费用和药品等。此外，还要作好优抚代耕工作。对进行恢复工作有困难的地区，决定有重点地加以扶持和照顾。一九五四年人民政府将拨款一百亿元，帮助这些地区的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属购买耕畜、农具，扶持他们参加互助合作组织；还拨发数十亿元帮助这些地区的人民修建房屋、校舍、卫生所，修建公路、水库，帮助群众修复塘堰，疏濬沟渠。
    河南省革命老根据地分布在全省七十四个县的六千九百多个乡。人口七百八十五万，占全省总人口的百分之十七点八。出席这次会议的代表有四百三十三名，会议上代表们除听取和讨论了河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃的“河南省老根据地经济恢复情况与今后建设意见”、中共河南省委员会农村工作部部长史向生关于互助合作的报告外，还交流了在革命老根据地区进行各项生产建设工作的经验，参观了工厂。他们纷纷表示：回去后要好好向革命老根据地人民传达这次会议的精神，并决心带动群众在今后各项建设事业中，发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。
