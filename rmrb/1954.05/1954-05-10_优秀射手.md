One evening in mid-March, in the barracks of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Zhoushan Islands, by the light of a kerosene lamp, Lu Yuanxiang, a soldier of the "People's Hero Company," and five or six of us were having an interesting conversation about the meeting that morning between Lu Yuanxiang and his uncle, Hua Xuefu, a representative of a visiting delegation.

"Isn't it a coincidence, one is a nephew, the other is an uncle!" one comrade said, half-questioning, half-asserting.

"Moreover, one is a soldier of the people, the other is a representative of the people!" another comrade also said, half-answering, half-affirming.

"In the past, in my hometown, I was the village branch secretary of the Youth League, and my uncle was the township branch secretary of the Youth League..." Lu Yuanxiang added.

"Ha! And now? Your uncle is a model agricultural worker in Zhejiang Province, and you are..."

"I've only been in the army for less than a year, but I've already been awarded a Third Class Merit once, so I can be considered an excellent sharpshooter in the People's Liberation Army." Although Lu Yuanxiang was a little shy when he talked about himself, he frankly used a simple sentence to explain his progress over the past year.

Lu Yuanxiang voluntarily joined the army and came to the "People's Hero Company" on April 27, 1953. On his first day at the company headquarters, he looked around the garrison. Not far to the south of the garrison was a mountain, and to the north was also a mountain. At night, the surroundings were pitch black, and the sky was half-obscured by these two mountains. It was not as pleasant to the eye as the scenic Fuchun River in his hometown. The thatched shed he lived in was very low, and he had to be careful not to bump his head when entering the door; outside was an endless sea. His hometown had a saying about the sea: "The river has no bottom, the sea has no edge," and he didn't know what was on the other side. Everything around him made him feel unfamiliar and mysterious, and he had the idea of "it would be better to join the troops stationed in Ningbo or Hangzhou." In addition, he drank some cold water on the way here and came down with dysentery. So, for seven days from the next day, he didn't eat and just lay in bed thinking. At that time, the troops were in the final stage of the cultural great march. In the morning, the veteran comrades were afraid of waking him up, so they read new words softly outside the door. He heard a sentence or two, and because of the different accents, he thought people were talking about him. This made the comrades in the squad feel that this new comrade was eccentric.

However, all the comrades in the squad still cared for him as warmly as they had welcomed him on the first day. Everyone was afraid that he couldn't eat, so they specially bought biscuits and apples from other places and put them by his bedside. The veteran soldier Ren Ruyi saw that he was wearing thin clothes and gave him a white shirt to wear. Deputy squad leader Nie Ziting and veteran soldier Dai Chaochan also took time out from their cultural studies to chat with him. Many facts prompted him to realize that his ideas were incorrect. First of all, he found that all the veteran comrades helped him like real brothers. He thought, "After all, the veteran comrades have a higher awareness, and the heroic company has a good style."

On "May Day," he participated in the soldiers' oath-taking conference while sick. He had read books for a year or so at home, and he roughly understood the content of the soldiers' oath, which aroused his inner struggle even more. When he was seven years old, his father died, and his uncles in the clan colluded with the landlord to seize his family's only five mu of land and three mu of bamboo forest. He was so angry that he broke the head of the landlord Sun Jingchuan's youngest son. As a result, the landlord insisted on breaking his mother's head to be satisfied. When the landlord was in power, poor peasants could only suffer. After liberation, his family was allocated nine mu of land and six mu of bamboo forest during the land reform. He joined the militia and overthrew the big tyrant to avenge his great revenge. He thought, "If I violate the oath, can't endure hardship, and make mistakes and go home, will I still have the face to see people?"

On the sixth day, Zhang Maoyi, the political instructor of the company, learned about his situation and came to his dormitory to see him. Lu Yuanxiang said excitedly, "Instructor, it's nothing to be sick, but I've had problems with my thinking..." So he told the instructor about his thoughts of not wanting to stay in the "People's Hero Company" and some of the problems he had been thinking about these days. The instructor then told him about their platoon: the "Military Training Model Platoon," and their squad: the "Assault Model Squad," and the heroic deeds of their platoon leader, "Explosive King" Ma Lixun, who had been sacrificed, and Cao Wenxuan, who was both a combat hero and a model Communist Party member. The instructor continued:

"Moreover, your current platoon leader, Second Class People's Hero Xu Eryue, in the Kaifeng battle in March 1948, automatically replaced the squad leader in an emergency and led the whole squad into the enemy's阵地, annihilating more than 500 enemies. He alone captured a company of enemies." Lu Yuanxiang listened breathlessly, more fascinated than when he was a child listening to his mother tell stories. The instructor added:

"Although we are stationed on an island, this island is our home, it is the motherland's unsinkable warship. The motherland and the island are completely connected. For example, your platoon leader Xu went to Beijing a few days ago. He represented our entire army to attend the 'May Day' observation ceremony and meet Chairman Mao."

After this conversation, Lu Yuanxiang figured out many problems. For example: Many veteran comrades have suffered so many years of hardship, even sacrificed their lives, to exchange for today's happiness and glory. To serve the people, is it okay not to endure hardship? He felt very regretful, thinking that he was a member of the Youth League and should not have such backward thinking of being afraid of hardship. Although he had not yet recovered from his illness at that time, he was already doing subjects on the beach with his comrades.

Lu Yuanxiang remembered the instructor's words: "Every soldier of the 'People's Hero Company' must maintain the honor of the heroes and carry forward the honor of the heroes." After that, in addition to the introduction of the comrades in the squad, he also saw the photos and deeds of more than 100 heroes, models, and meritorious people, such as the young hero Lin Maocheng, who had appeared in the company in the past, in the company club. He saw the introduction of the company's military history, and the dozens of silk banners presented by the superiors and the masses for the whole company's meritorious service to the people. These were great encouragement to him. He has regarded being a soldier in the "People's Hero Company" as his greatest glory.

Lu Yuanxiang had never held a rifle before, but soon after he arrived in the army, he learned some basic movements of mastering the rifle and understood the performance of the rifle. When he became interested in the rifle, Company Commander Zhang Lingzhi and the instructor had already taken a fancy to Lu Yuanxiang's height, strong body, and simple purity, and believed that he had the potential to be cultivated. In early July, Lu Yuanxiang was issued a submachine gun made in the motherland. Company Commander Zhang also said to Lu Yuanxiang, "This new gun is made in the motherland, you take it and use it well." "Yes! I must use it well." Lu Yuanxiang saluted and took the gun.

Lu Yuanxiang held the submachine gun tightly, feeling an unspeakable excitement and excitement in his heart. He was excited about the trust of the people of the motherland and the leaders, that being a submachine gunner could annihilate more enemies and defend the motherland. He was excited about how not to fail the hopes of the motherland and the leaders and to use this submachine gun made by the worker brothers well.

In the hot summer, Lu Yuanxiang stood on the playground practicing the basic movements of the submachine gun. Veteran soldier Ren Ruyi also accompanied him, helping him correct his posture. Ren Ruyi liked this young man's strength; Lu Yuanxiang, from the beginning, had a very good impression of Ren Ruyi, and he knew that Ren Ruyi was an excellent submachine gunner. Lu Yuanxiang was planning one thing in his mind: he wanted to fight for rest time to practice, but he was afraid of causing too much trouble for Ren Ruyi. Once, Lu Yuanxiang asked Ren Ruyi:

"I heard that we will be shooting targets in three days, Comrade Ren Ruyi, we have to think of a 'trick'!"

"A trick, I think the shooting essentials are the 'trick'. As for the others, I think it depends on your own hard work."

"Then we have to work harder. I want to use all the rest time. Do you think it's okay?"

"Yes, since we are guaranteeing teaching and learning, we guarantee that you will catch up with everyone."

From then on, every morning, before the dew on the ground was dry, Lu Yuanxiang crawled on the ground and began to practice aiming. The dew wet Lu Yuanxiang's clothes, but he didn't care about it. At noon, the ground was as hot as fire, and Lu Yuanxiang was sweating profusely, but he still continued to practice aiming. In the evening, Lu Yuanxiang sometimes held a flashlight to recite the formulas and study the regulations.

Ren Ruyi was also enthusiastic enough. Whenever he had time, he ran to Lu Yuanxiang to help him aim and guide him to master the essentials: "The ruler mouth is aligned with the star, and the three points form a line..." Even if a small movement was inaccurate, Ren Ruyi helped him correct it. Lu Yuanxiang was indeed a good student. In addition to the normal subject time, almost all the rest and game time was spent on practicing aiming. The longest time, he kept his right eye open and his left eye closed, aiming for 35 minutes.

On the day of the formal target shooting, Lu Yuanxiang's heart seemed to be grabbed by someone. It was not until he saw Comrade Ren Ruyi that he gradually calmed down. After he received the order to enter the shooting position, he kept the essentials in mind and closed his mouth tightly to hold his breath. Three shots, three hits, this was Lu Yuanxiang's first shooting result. The comrades praised him for his excellent results; but some people also told him: Don't close your mouth when pulling the trigger in the future, otherwise your ears will be deafened.

Soon, the squad leader taught him to disassemble and wash the guns. He watched without blinking, and after watching for a while, he learned to assemble it himself. According to him, "Now, not only the shooting essentials, but also the temper of this gun, I have learned it." From then on, he loved this submachine gun made in the motherland even more. In the morning mist, on the beach in the evening, Lu Yuanxiang was either standing or lying down, holding his submachine gun all day long, aiming at a small tree or a sharp stone. Later, there were two more live ammunition shootings. Whether it was a fixed target or a moving target, whether it was prone shooting or standing shooting, whether it was point firing or burst firing, each time the result was "excellent" (the highest level in military training, equivalent to "five points"). Not only was Lu Yuanxiang's shooting result "excellent," but in last year's military study test, he scored "excellent" in 14 of the 16 subjects.

After last year's autumn harvest, before the fourth target shooting, Lu Yuanxiang's hometown had another bumper harvest. His mother insisted that his brother accompany her to the island to see Lu Yuanxiang. But when his mother arrived on the island, she saw that Lu Yuanxiang had grown much taller and stronger, and he was also very energetic because he had just returned from swimming in the sea, his face red. She almost didn't recognize her son. His mother only said one sentence at the time: "The People's Liberation Army's food is really nourishing." The old lady lived in the troops for a few days, thanking the company commander, the squad leader, and every comrade in front of her everywhere. Before leaving, the mother said to her son: "Yuanxiang, I order you two things: First, you must listen to the squad leader, just like listening to me at home. Second, you must send back a meritorious service announcement. If not, I will ask your brother to write a letter to criticize you." Lu Yuanxiang agreed to his mother's request.

After another month of study, Lu Yuanxiang participated in the fourth live ammunition shooting. Lu Yuanxiang enthusiastically told me about the process of this target shooting. He said, "Hey! This shooting was complicated: a total of six enemies (straw targets) ran over along the traffic trench. The leadership issued me 20 bullets and ordered me to hold the submachine gun level and eliminate all the invading enemies within the specified time. According to the order, I quickly entered the position. When the enemy entered the effective range, I swept down the first three enemies with eight bullets. I corrected the scale again. When the second group of three enemies was closer, I knocked down the first two with four bullets. At this time, watching the last enemy was about to touch上来了, I knew in my heart that I had eliminated five of the six enemies, and logically it was enough to get an excellent result, but the training ground is the battlefield, how can I relax every opportunity to eliminate the enemy? I did not forget the essentials for a moment, and quickly aimed the bullet point tightly at the last enemy's chest and came up with a burst, smashing the straw man to pieces. The comrade in charge of the test ran over from the opposite side and reported to the company commander:

'Report, all the enemies in front have been eliminated, and the shooting result is excellent.' Comrade Ren Ruyi and the company commander were so happy, and I was also particularly happy."

Due to the improvement of his ideological awareness and his usual hard work in military studies, Lu Yuanxiang achieved excellent results in shooting and other aspects and was awarded a Third Class Merit by the company. During the Spring Festival this year, according to his mother's instructions, he sent the meritorious service announcement issued by the superiors to his beloved mother.

I also remember that at the meeting to visit the "Assault Model Squad," Lu Yuanxiang said to his uncle in a confident tone: "Please bring a message back to my mother and relatives in the motherland. Please rest assured that I will study more humbly, improve my political and cultural level, learn a set of modern military technology, and defend the security of the motherland and build socialism." We can believe that Lu Yuanxiang will definitely have greater contributions in the future. (Attached picture)

    优秀射手
    本报记者　甄为民
    三月中旬的一个晚上，在人民解放军驻舟山群岛某部的营房里，在一盏煤油灯的旁边，“人民英雄连”的战士陆袁相和我们五六个人，正在饶有兴味地谈论着当天上午陆袁相和他的舅舅、慰问团代表华学富相会的事情。
    “你说巧不巧，一个是外甥，一个是舅舅！”一个同志似问非问地说。
    “而且，一个是人民的战士，一个是人民的代表！”另一个同志也似答非答地说。
    “过去在乡里我是团的村支部书记，舅舅是团的乡支部书记……。”陆袁相补充着说。
    “哈！现在呢？你舅舅是浙江省的农业劳动模范，你是……”。
    “我还刚参军不到一年，不过也已立过一次三等功，也算是个解放军的优秀射手。”虽然陆袁相说到他自己的时候有些羞涩，然而，他毕竟坦率地用一句简单的话说明了他一年来的进步。
    陆袁相是一九五三年四月二十七日自愿参军来到“人民英雄连”的。来到连部的第一天，他曾在驻地周围看了一遍。驻地的南边不远是一座山，北边也是一座山，一到晚上四周漆黑，天空也被这两座山遮没了一半，并不像他的家乡山明水秀的富春江边叫人看得顺眼。住的茅草棚很矮，一不当心进门就要碰头；出门就是一望无际的大海，对于海，他的家乡有一种传说：“江无底，海无边”，也不知对面是什么地方。周围的一切使他觉得生疏和玄奥莫测，使他产生了“倒不如参加驻宁波或者杭州的部队”的思想。再加上他来时路上喝了些凉水，拉起痢来了。所以从第二天起，有七天时间，他饭也不吃，老是躺在床上想东想西。那时部队正是文化大进军的最后阶段，早上老同志怕吵醒他，轻声轻气地在门外念生字，他听到一句半句的，因为口音不同，他还以为人家在说他什么呢？弄得班里的同志都觉得这个新同志脾气古怪。
    可是，全班的同志都依然像欢迎他的那天那么热心地照顾他，大家怕他不能吃饭，特地从别地买来了饼干和苹果放在他的床头，老战士任如义见他衣服穿得单，把自己一件白衬衣送给他穿。副班长聂子亭和老战士戴朝灿也抽出文化学习后的休息时间来和他扯谈。很多事实促使他认识到自己的想法不正确。首先，他发现所有的老同志都像亲兄弟一样来帮助他。他想：“到底还是老同志觉悟高，英雄连队作风好。”
    “五一”节那天，他带病参加了军人宣誓大会。他在家里读过年把书，军人誓词的内容大致他都懂，这更引起了他的内心斗争。七岁那年，他父亲死了，宗族里的叔叔勾结地主来夺他家仅有的五亩田、三亩竹山。他气愤不过，把地主孙荆川的小儿子的头打破了，结果那个地主，一定要把他母亲的头打破才肯甘休，在地主当权的时候，贫苦农民只有受气。在解放以后，土地改革中他家才分到九亩田、六亩竹山；他参加了民兵队，打倒了大恶霸，报了大仇。他想：“如果我违背誓词，吃不了苦，犯了错误回家去，还有脸见人吗？”
    到第六天，连里政治指导员张茂义同志知道他的情况，又到他宿舍里来看望他。陆袁相激动地说：“指导员，病倒没有什么，我思想上出了岔子……。”于是他把那个不安心在“人民英雄连”的思想和这几天想到的一些问题统通告诉了指导员。指导员于是就跟他讲起他们的排：“立训文选排”，他们的班：“突击模范班”的事迹，讲到他们排已牺牲的排长“爆破大王”马立训和又是战斗英雄又是模范共产党员的曹文选的英雄事迹。指导员接着说：
      “再说，你们现在的排长，二级人民英雄许而月，他在一九四八年三月开封战斗中，在紧急情况下自动代替班长，率领全班冲入敌阵，歼灭敌人五百多名，仅他一个人就俘掳了一个连的敌人。”陆袁相屏息地听着，比小时候听妈妈说故事还要入迷。指导员又说：
      “我们虽然驻在海岛上，然而，这个岛就是我们的家，就是祖国不沉的兵舰。祖国和海岛是完全连成一气的，例如前些日子你们的许排长就到北京去了，他是代表咱们全军去参加‘五一’观礼，见毛主席去的。”
    经过这次谈话，陆袁相想通了很多问题。例如：许多老同志吃了这许多年的苦，甚至牺牲了生命，才换了今天的幸福和光荣，要为人民服务，不吃苦还行吗？他非常后悔，认为自己是个青年团员，不应该有那种怕吃苦的落后思想。虽然那时他的病还未痊愈，但是他已经和同志们一块儿在海滩上做科目了。
    陆袁相记住了指导员的话：“每一个‘人民英雄连’的战士，都要保持英雄们的荣誉，发扬英雄们的荣誉。”以后除了班里同志的介绍，他在连队俱乐部里，也看到了全连过去出现的青年英雄林茂成等一百多位英雄、模范、功臣的照片和事迹，看到本连的军史介绍，看到全连在各方面为人民立了功，上级和群众所赠送的几十面锦旗。这些对他是极大的鼓舞，他已把能够在“人民英雄连”当一个战士，当成自己最大的光荣。
                ×　×　×
    陆袁相过去没有拿过步枪，可是他到部队不久，就学会了掌握步枪的一些基本动作，懂得了步枪的性能。当他对步枪发生了兴趣的时候，张令志连长和指导员，却已看上了陆袁相的个儿高，身体壮，质朴纯洁，认为他有培养前途。到七月初，就发给了陆袁相一支祖国造的冲锋枪。张连长还对陆袁相说：“这支新枪是祖国造的，你拿去好好使用。”“是！我一定要好好使用。”陆袁相敬了礼，接过了枪。
    陆袁相爱不释手地紧握着那支冲锋枪，心里经常有一种难言的兴奋和激动。兴奋的是祖国人民和上级首长对他的信任，当一个冲锋枪手可以更多地歼灭敌人，保卫祖国；激动的是如何才不辜负祖国和上级首长的希望，很好地去使用工人兄弟制造的这支冲锋枪。
    炎热的夏天，陆袁相站在操场上练习着冲锋枪的基本动作，老战士任如义也陪着他，帮他纠正姿式。任如义喜欢这个小伙子刚强；陆袁相呢，打一开头就对任如义的印象很好，而且他知道任如义是个优秀的冲锋枪手。陆袁相心里盘算着一件事：他想争取休息时间来练习，又怕过分麻烦任如义。有一次，陆袁相问任如义道：
    “听说再过三天就要打靶，任如义同志，我们得想个‘窍门’哩！”
    “窍门，射击要领我说就是‘窍门’，其他嘛，我看就要靠自己勤学苦练。”
      “那么说，我们还得勤苦点，我想把休息时间都用上，你说行吗。”
    “对，咱俩既然是包教保学，包你赶得上大家。”
    从此以后，每天的早晨，地上露水未干，陆袁相就爬在地上开始练习瞄准了，露水润湿了陆袁相的衣裳，他也不去管它。中午，地上像火一样热得烫人，陆袁相热得汗流浃背，可是，他仍然继续练习瞄准。到晚上，有时陆袁相还拿着手电筒在念口诀，熟读条令。
    任如义也够热心，一有空就跑到陆袁相这边来，帮他瞄准，指导他掌握要领：“尺口对准星，三点成一线……。”哪怕是一个细小的动作不准确，任如义都帮他改正。陆袁相呢，也的确是一个好学生，除正常科目时间外，每天的休息和游戏时间，几乎都用在练习瞄准上面了。最长的一次，就这样睁大右眼，紧闭左眼，瞄准了三十五分钟之久。
    到正式打靶的那一天，陆袁相的心好像给谁抓了一把，直到他看到了任如义同志，才逐渐平静下来。当他接到命令进入射击位置以后，他紧记着要领，为了屏住呼吸而紧闭着嘴巴。连打三枪，三枪三中，这是陆袁相第一次射击的成绩。同志们都为他优秀的成绩而夸奖他；可是也有的人告诉他：以后扣火时不要闭着嘴巴，否则是要把耳朵震聋的。
    不久，班长又教他学着拆洗枪枝。他眼睛也不眨地看着，看了一会儿以后自己又学着把它装起来。照他的说法：“现在，不但是射击要领，连这枝枪的脾气我也摸熟了。”从此以后，他更加爱上了这枝祖国造的冲锋枪。在早晨的薄雾里，在傍晚的海滩上，陆袁相不是站着就是伏着，整天端着他的冲锋枪，在对准着一棵小树或一块尖石瞄准。后来又进行了两次实弹射击，不管是固定靶或者活动靶，不管是卧射或者立射，点放或者连发，每次成绩都是“优秀”（是军事训练中的最高等级，相当于“五分”）。陆袁相不但射击成绩是“优秀”，去年全连军事学习测验，十六项科目，他十四项成绩都是“优秀”。
                  ×　×　×
    去年秋收以后，第四次打靶以前，陆袁相家乡又获丰收，母亲一定要他哥哥陪她来海岛上看望陆袁相。可是妈妈到海岛上看到陆袁相身体长高了许多，也结实得多了，再加上刚从海边洗过澡回来，面孔红红的，十分精神，几乎认不出儿子了。他母亲当时只说了一句话：“解放军的饭真是补人的。”老太太在部队里住了几天，到处谢谢连长、班长，谢谢她面前的每个同志。临走时，妈妈对儿子说：“袁相，我吩咐你两件事：第一件，你要听班长的话，就像在家里听我的话一样。第二件，一定要寄立功喜报回来，如果没有，我叫你哥哥写信来批评你。”陆袁相答应了妈妈的要求。
    又经过了一个月的学习，陆袁相参加了第四次实弹射击。陆袁相热情地向我述说着这次打靶的经过。他说：“嘿！这次射击就复杂了：共有六个敌人（草靶）沿着交通壕跑步冲过来，领导上发给我二十发子弹，并命令我在规定的时间内，要平端着冲锋枪，消灭全部来犯的敌人。按照命令我迅速进入了阵地，当敌人进入有效射程以后，我以八发子弹扫倒了前面的三个敌人。我又订正了标尺，当第二组三个敌人更接近时，我就以四发子弹打倒了前面的两个。这时，眼看着最后的一个敌人就要摸上来了，我心里有数，六个敌人已给我消灭了五个，照理也够得上优秀的成绩了，可是操场就是战场，怎么可以放松每一个消灭敌人的机会呢。我一时一刻也没有忘记要领，连忙把弹着点紧紧对准了最后
  一个敌人胸口，来了一个连发，把这个草人打得稀烂。负责测验的同志从对面跑过来向连长报告：
  ‘报告，前面敌人全部消灭，射击成绩优秀。’任如义同志和连长，都开心得什么似的，我心里也特别高兴。”
    陆袁相在军事学习中由于思想觉悟的提高，和平时的勤学苦练，因而在射击等方面获得优秀的成绩，被连里评为三等功。今年春节，按照母亲的嘱咐，他把上级发来的立功喜报寄给了亲爱的妈妈。
    我还记得在那次访问“突击模范班”的会上，陆袁相带着充分自信的语气对舅舅说：“请舅舅回去时给我捎个信，告诉母亲和祖国的亲人，请他们放心，我一定要更虚心地学习，提高政治文化水平，学会一套现代化的军事技术，保卫祖国安全和建设社会主义。”我们可以相信：陆袁相今后一定还会有更大的贡献。（附图片）
