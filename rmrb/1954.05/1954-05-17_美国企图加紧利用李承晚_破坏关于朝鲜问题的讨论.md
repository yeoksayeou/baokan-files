    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th, dispatch from Pyongyang, May 14th, TASS: The Korean Central News Agency relayed a report from South Korea's Tongyang News Agency stating that Syngman Rhee declared on May 8th that he would "advance north, completely disregarding the Geneva Conference." At the end of April, shortly after the opening of the Geneva Conference, Ko Hong-ki, Director of the Public Information Office of the Rhee government, demanded that the United States and its "allies" "quickly disrupt the Geneva Conference to help the advance north."
    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: U.S. authorities are attempting to intensify the exploitation of Syngman Rhee to further disrupt discussions on the Korean issue, preventing a peaceful resolution to the problem.
    According to a report by the United Press, Syngman Rhee hysterically issued a war cry on May 13th, saying, "The time has come to recognize that efforts to negotiate peace with the Communists in Geneva have failed, and the war should be resumed." According to Reuters, members of the South Korean delegation in Geneva also released information stating that "negotiations on the Korean issue are doomed to fail." These people also said without any concealment that "the only remaining question is to decide on a strategy to break off negotiations." At the same time, according to reports from American and British news agencies, Syngman Rhee, in order to block the path to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue through consultation, has notified his representatives in Geneva to "insist" on the absurd condition of holding elections only in North Korea under the supervision of the United Nations, a belligerent party, and has also put forward absurd conditions including the demand to disarm the Korean People's Army.
    On the one hand, the U.S. authorities are instigating Syngman Rhee to frantically obstruct and disrupt discussions on the Korean issue, preventing this discussion from progressing. On the other hand, they are intensifying their plans to completely destroy the discussion of this issue, in order to achieve their despicable goal of obstructing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. According to the International News Service, diplomatic figures in Washington openly threatened on May 13th, saying that "the United States will consider interrupting the Geneva discussions on the Korean issue." This person also said that "it would not be surprising if the United States took this step in the near future." According to Reuters, the U.S. delegation attending the Geneva Conference "is considering ways to quickly end the meeting discussing the Korean issue, and its method is to tell the Communist side that unless they are prepared to agree to elections throughout Korea supervised by the United Nations, there is no reason to continue holding the nineteen-nation conference (note: discussion on the Korean issue)." This conspiracy by the U.S. authorities is clearly creating an excuse to sabotage discussions on the Korean issue and attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the discussion onto others.
    However, the world's forces demanding peace are not as easily ignored as the U.S. authorities imagine, and if they continue to disregard this force, the result will be an even greater failure.

### 美国企图加紧利用李承晚  破坏关于朝鲜问题的讨论

    美国企图加紧利用李承晚
    破坏关于朝鲜问题的讨论
   【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社平壤十四日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社转播南朝鲜东洋通讯社的一条消息说：李承晚五月八日宣称，他将“完全不顾日内瓦会议而北进”。在四月底，日内瓦会议刚开幕不久，李承晚政府公报处处长葛弘基就要求美国和它的“盟国”“迅速地破坏日内瓦会议，以帮助北进。”
    【新华社十五日讯】美国当局正在企图加紧利用李承晚进一步破坏关于朝鲜问题的讨论，使得这个问题得不到和平解决。
    据合众社报道，李承晚十三日又歇斯底里地发出战争叫嚣说：“现在已是时候，应该承认在日内瓦和共产党谈判和平的努力已告失败，应该恢复战争了。”据路透社报道，在日内瓦的南朝鲜代表团的人也放出空气说，“朝鲜问题的谈判是注定要失败的了”。这些人还毫不掩饰地说，“唯一剩下来的问题，便是来决定使谈判破裂的战略”。同时，据美国和英国的通讯社报道，李承晚为了堵塞通过协商和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，已经通知他的在日内瓦的代表“坚持”要求只是在北朝鲜举行由交战一方的联合国主持的选举的荒谬条件，并且还提出了包括要求解除朝鲜人民军武装之类的荒谬条件。
    美国当局一方面指使李承晚对关于朝鲜问题的讨论进行疯狂的阻挠和破坏，使得这个讨论得不到进展，另一方面加紧策划完全破坏这个问题的讨论，以达到它阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的卑鄙目的。据国际新闻社报道，华盛顿方面的外交人士十三日公然威胁说，“美国会考虑中断日内瓦的关于朝鲜问题的讨论”。这个人还说，“如果美国在最近将来采取这个步骤，那并不是出乎意外的事情”。据路透社报道，出席日内瓦会议的美国代表团“正在考虑设法迅速结束讨论朝鲜问题的会议，它的办法是：告诉共产党方面，除非他们准备同意由联合国监督全朝鲜的选举，否则没有理由再继续举行十九国会议（按：关于朝鲜问题的讨论）。”美国当局的这个阴谋，显然是在制造破坏关于朝鲜问题的讨论的借口，并且企图把破坏讨论责任推在别人身上。
    但是，全世界要求和平的力量并不如美国当局想像的那样容易被忽视的，如果他们继续无视这种力量，结果将会遭到更大的失败。
