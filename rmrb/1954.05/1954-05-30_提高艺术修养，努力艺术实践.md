The "Fascist Bacteria" Staged

The China Youth Art Theater's five-act, six-scene play "Fascist Bacteria" premiered at the Beijing Youth Palace on May 23rd. Through the characters of Yu Shifu and his friends Zhao Antao, Qin Zhengyi, and Qian Qinxian, it depicts the various thoughts and different performances of intellectuals during the Anti-Japanese War. After being educated by real life, Yu Shifu realized that "the most harmful to human life is not typhus bacteria, but Fascist bacteria." He abandoned the idea of "science for science's sake, regardless of politics" and embarked on the road of resistance against Japan. At the same time, the play also reflects the patriotic sentiments of the Chinese people during the Anti-Japanese War through the event of the Japanese fascist army invading China; it also reveals the anti-fascist sentiments of the Japanese people at that time through the character of Jingzi. The development of the event educates the audience that fascism is bound to perish.

The play "Fascist Bacteria" was written during the Anti-Japanese War by Xia Yan. The first performance of this play was by the Chongqing China Drama Art Society, and the directors at that time were Hong Shen and Ying Yunwei. From 1942 to 1945, it was performed successively in Chengdu, Guilin, and other places.

Hong Shen is still the director of the China Youth Art Theater's performance of this play. During the rehearsal process, the playwright Xia Yan gave the actors a report on the creative motives and thematic ideas of the play, giving the actors a lot of inspiration in creating characters.

"Delivering to the Doorstep, Reclaiming Wasteland on the Spot"

In order to meet the urgent needs of Anshan Iron and Steel workers in cultural life, the Anshan City Cultural Troupe decided to participate in the city's basic construction cultural service team. It sent a music and dance team to perform in small and diverse forms in construction sites, mines, and workers' residential areas; at the same time, it also undertook the task of guiding workers' amateur cultural activities. In order to improve the professional level of workers' amateur theater troupes and amateur literary and art workers, the troupe will also jointly hold amateur literary and art lectures with the Anshan City Culture Bureau, the Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions, and the Anshan City Committee of the Communist Youth League to provide guidance.

The troupe plans to stage 120 performances throughout the year, including plays "Red Flag," "The Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "Is Changhai Leaving?", and dances "Northeast Yangko," etc. They will also rehearse programs reflecting the life and struggle of the working people building Anshan Iron and Steel. In order to improve the professional level of the actors and ensure the quality of the performance, the comrades in charge of music and dance have gone to Beijing, Jinan, Shenyang, and other places to learn Qinshu, singing, etc. from local art groups, and the drama team has also gone deep into the countryside to experience life. (Liu Yuquan)

Plays "Red Flag" and "People Strive for Higher Goals" to be Staged

Following "Can't Live Like This," the Beijing People's Art Theater will soon stage "Red Flag" (a three-act play) and "People Strive for Higher Goals" (a one-act, three-scene play).

"Red Flag" describes a mechanical factory's handling of work quotas in the Red Flag competition, praising the excellent qualities and creative labor enthusiasm of advanced figures in the working class, and criticizing bourgeois individualism. The director and actors of the play went to the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory in January this year to experience life. By participating in trade union work, participating in mentor-apprentice seminars, technical personnel seminars, army-supporting and model-awarding conferences, and going deep into workshops to participate in labor, they made friends with the workers. During the Spring Festival, the actors visited veteran workers to extend New Year's greetings and followed the workers' visiting team to the countryside to carry out propaganda for the worker-peasant alliance. After returning to Beijing, they immediately began intensive rehearsals.

"People Strive for Higher Goals" is about how a middle peasant in a village recognized the mistakes of spontaneous capitalist ideas and embarked on the road of cooperation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. During the Spring Festival propaganda for the general task of the state during the transition period, the play was performed in the rural areas of Beijing's eastern suburbs, Guanyintang, and Gaobeidian. After the performance, each village held a forum to discuss the play, and unanimously agreed that after watching the play, they further recognized the benefits of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After the Spring Festival performance, the director and actors of the play went to the Huangtugang Production Cooperative again to experience life, and rehearsed again in combination with the performance practice, so that everyone had a deeper understanding of the characters described in the play.

After the above two plays are staged in the theater, they will tour various factories in Beijing.

Comparative Performance of New and Old Opera Scripts

In order to check the drama reform work in Chongqing in 1953, a working group composed of the Southwest Cultural Bureau and the Chongqing Cultural Bureau organized a comparative performance of the new and old versions of the Sichuan opera "Lotus Lantern" and "The Case of Chen Shimei" on May 19th and 20th. Responsible persons from cultural organs in the Southwest and Chongqing, responsible persons from various Sichuan opera theaters, and playwrights, directors, and actors were invited to watch the performances. After the performance, a forum was held on the afternoon of the 24th. At the meeting, veteran artists such as Wu Xiaolei introduced the aspects of the revised versions of "Lotus Lantern" and "The Case of Chen Shimei" from other brother opera genres that are worth learning from. The participants carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of the new and old scripts. Everyone believed that the comparative performance of the new and old scripts is not only a good method for checking and researching work, but also makes it easier to identify the essence and dross of the old scripts when revising the scripts, so as to promote the people's nature in the play and eliminate its feudal nature. This is a good help and education for comrades participating in drama reform work. (Literary and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau)

Central South Writers Association Formulates Work Plan

The Central South Writers Association recently formulated the main points of the 1954 work plan. According to this plan, this year, 14 writers will be organized to go deep into factories, rural areas, and troops to experience life. According to the creative plans made by the writers themselves, two full-length novels, two long poems, two multi-act plays, two novellas, two to three one-act plays, and several short stories and short poems can be created this year. The Creation Committee and the Yangtze River Literature and Art Editorial Department will focus on organizing excellent one-act plays and short story creation, and strengthening the training of writers and correspondents. They will organize veteran writers to provide regular creative assistance and guidance to new writers and correspondents, and decide to hold a correspondent conference this year to help correspondents conduct short-term studies. In addition, they are preparing to systematically train literary and art theory and criticism workers and correctly carry out literary and art criticism work. They will organize literary and art lectures and seminars, and systematically organize writers to carry out social activities. In order to summarize creative experience and improve creative level, the plan stipulates that a creative conference will be held at the end of this year.

Anhui Province Continues to Excavate Folk Opera Programs

The Anhui Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau convened a local opera program research seminar in April to further excavate the inherent excellent programs of various opera genres. The meeting was attended by more than 50 cadres, artists, and opera creation cadres from 15 troupes of seven opera genres, including Daoqi Opera, Huangmei Opera, Sizhou Opera, Southern Anhui Flower Drum Opera, Yue Opera, Peking Opera, and Bangzi Opera.

In the past, the Anhui Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau had organized forces to conduct a "survey" of the programs of several opera genres such as Daoqi Opera and Sizhou Opera, but it was not fully understood. At this meeting, through specific research on the programs of various opera genres, veteran artists were inspired to look for the plays that were popular with the masses in the past, the most skilled by actors, and the most popular in rural areas. In this way, 16 main plays and 45 small plays and excerpts were selected again. The themes expressed in these programs are very broad, including satirical ones such as "Hanging the Doorplate" and "Disturbing the Huang Mansion," those expressing the ancient people's pursuit of a happy love life such as "Three Drives" and "Two Girls Watching Lanterns," those reflecting the persecution of the people by feudal rulers such as "Hitting the Haba," and those expressing people's wisdom, bravery, and patriotic ideas such as "Stopping the Horse." This selection broke through the narrow circle of only looking for young male and female roles, and many clown roles were also selected. The sorting work will focus on small plays and excerpts, and will be jointly carried out by playwright cadres and artists of state-owned troupes. (Jin Quancai)

    提高艺术修养，努力艺术实践
    法西斯细菌”上演
    中国青年艺术剧院排演的五幕六场话剧“法西斯细菌”，在五月二十三日起在北京青年宫公演。它通过俞实夫和他的朋友赵安涛、秦正谊、钱琴仙等人物，描绘了抗日战争中知识分子的各种思想和不同的表现。俞实夫受到现实生活的教育以后，认识到“最危害人类生命的，不是斑疹伤寒细菌，而是法西斯细菌”，他抛弃了“为科学而科学，不问政治”的思想，走向抗战的道路。同时，剧本还通过日本法西斯军队侵略中国这一事件，反映出抗战时期中国人民的爱国情绪；也从剧中人静子身上看出当时日本人民的反法西斯情绪。事件的发展教育观众，法西斯主义必然要灭亡的。
    剧本“法西斯细菌”是在抗日战争时期写的，作者是夏衍。第一次演出这个戏的是重庆中华剧艺社，当时的导演就是洪深和应云卫。在一九四二年到一九四五年期间，曾先后在成都、桂林等地演出。
    中国青年艺术剧院排演这个剧本时，仍由洪深担任导演。在排演过程中，剧作者夏衍曾给演员报告创作动机和剧本的主题思想，给予演员在进行人物创造方面很多启示。　　　　　（郭奋杨）
  “送上门去，就地开荒”
    鞍山市文工团为了满足鞍钢职工在文化生活方面的迫切需要，决定参加市基本建设文化服务队。派出音乐舞蹈队以小型多样的形式，深入工地、矿山及工人住宅区作巡回演出；同时，也负担辅导职工业余文艺活动的任务。为了提高职工业余剧团及业余文艺工作者的业务水平，该团并将与鞍山市文化局、鞍山市工会联合会及青年团鞍山市委联合举办业余文艺讲座，进行辅导。
    该团计划全年上演一百二十场，将演出话剧
  “红旗”、“春风吹到诺敏河”、“长海走不走”及歌舞“东北大秧歌”等节目。排演反映建设鞍钢的劳动人民生活斗争的节目。为了提高演员业务水平，保证演出质量，该团负责音乐舞蹈方面的同志已分别到北京、济南、沈阳等地向当地各艺术团体学习琴书、演唱等，话剧队也深入农村体验生活。
                                （刘玉诠）
  话剧“红旗”“人往高处走”将上演
    北京人民艺术剧院继“非这样生活不可”之后，将在最近上演“红旗”（三幕话剧）和“人往高处走”（独幕三场）两剧。
      “红旗”是描写某机械工厂在红旗竞赛中通过工作定额的问题，歌颂了工人阶级中先进人物的优秀品质和创造性的劳动热情，并批判了资产阶级个人主义思想。该剧的导演和演员于今年一月赴大连工矿车辆厂体验生活，通过参加工会工作，参加师徒座谈会、技术人员座谈会、拥军奖模大会与深入车间参加劳动，与工人交了朋友。春节时演员们分头向老师傅拜年，并随工人访问队到农村进行工农联盟的宣传。返京后，即开始进入紧张的排练工作。
      “人往高处走”是写某村在互助合作运动中，一个中农如何认识了自发资本主义思想的错误而走上合作化道路。春节国家过渡时期总任务的宣传中，该剧曾在北京东郊、观音堂、高碑店一带农村演出，各村在演出后都开座谈会对该剧展开讨论，一致认为在看戏后，更进一步认识了互助合作运动的好处。春节演出后。该剧导演和演员，再次下乡到黄土岗生产合作社体验生活，结合演出实践再次进行排练，使大家对剧中描写的人物有更深的体会。
    以上两剧在剧场上演后，即到北京市各工厂巡回演出。
  新旧戏曲剧本对照演出
    为了检查一九五三年重庆市的戏剧改革工作，以西南文化局和重庆市文化局等单位组成的工作组于五月十九、二十日两天组织了川剧“宝莲灯”和
  “铡美案”的新旧本对照观摩演出，邀请了西南、重庆市各文化机关负责人，各川剧院负责人和编导、演员等观剧。演出后，又在二十四日下午举行座谈会。会上，吴晓雷等老艺人介绍了其他兄弟剧种“宝莲灯”和“铡美案”的修改本中值得学习的地方。与会者认真地研究了新旧剧本的优缺点，大家都认为新旧剧本的对照演出不仅是检查、研究工作的良好方法，也使修改剧本时便于识别旧剧本中的精华和糟粕部分，以发扬剧中的人民性而剔除其封建性，这对参加戏剧改革工作的同志是一个较好的帮助和教育。　　　（西南局宣传部文艺处）
  中南作家协会制订工作计划
    中南作家协会最近制订了一九五四年的工作计划要点。根据这计划，今年将组织十四位作家到工厂、农村、部队深入生活。根据作家个人所订创作计划，今年可创作长篇小说两部，长诗两部，多幕话剧两部，中篇小说两部，独幕话剧二至三个，及短篇小说、短诗数篇。创作委员会与长江文艺编辑部将着重组织优秀的独幕剧、短篇创作，和加强对作家与通讯员的培养工作。组织老作家对新作家与通讯员经常地进行创作的帮助和指导，并决定今年召开通讯员会议，帮助通讯员进行短期学习。此外，准备有计划地培养文艺理论批评工作者，正确地开展文艺批评工作。组织文艺讲座和座谈会，有计划地组织作家开展社会活动。为了总结创作经验、提高创作水平，计划中确定今年年底召开创作会议。
  安徽省继续发掘民间戏曲剧目
    安徽省文化事业管理局于四月份内，召开了地方戏剧目研究座谈会，以进一步发掘各剧种固有的优秀剧目。到会的有倒七戏、黄梅戏、泗洲戏、皖南花鼓戏、越剧、京剧及梆子戏等七个剧种的十五个剧团的干部、艺人、戏曲创作干部等五十余人。
    过去安徽省文化事业管理局曾组织力量，对倒七戏、泗洲戏等几个剧种的剧目进行过“摸底”，但并未摸清。这次会上，通过对各剧种剧目的具体研究，启发老艺人从过去受群众欢迎的、演员最拿手的和在农村中最流行的等方面的戏里去找。这样，又选出了本戏十六本，小戏和折戏四十五个。这些剧目所表现的题材非常广阔，有讽刺性的“挂门牌”、“闹黄府”，有表现古代人民追求幸福爱情生活的“三赶”、“二姑娘看灯”，有反映封建统治者迫害人民的“打哈叭”，有表现人民智慧、勇敢，富有爱国思想的“拦马”等。这次挑选，突破了专找小生、小旦戏的狭小圈子，对丑角戏等，也选了不少。整理工作，将以小戏和折戏为重点，由国营剧团的编剧干部和艺人共同整理。
