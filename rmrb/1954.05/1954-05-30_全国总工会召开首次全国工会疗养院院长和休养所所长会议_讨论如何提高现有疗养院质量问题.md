The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently convened the first National Conference of Sanatorium Directors and Rest Home Managers in the Qingdao Sanatorium Area. Representatives from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and other departments also participated.

This conference implemented the policy of "serving production and serving the masses" proposed by the Labor Insurance Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in March, focusing on discussing and resolving how to consolidate, rectify, and improve the quality of existing sanatoriums.

During the conference, representatives from seven units, including the Southwest Second Workers' Sanatorium, the Zhalantun Railway Sanatorium, and the Dalian Sanatorium of the China Second Machinery Trade Union, introduced their experiences in consolidating, rectifying, and improving sanatorium work. After these sanatoriums underwent rectification, they played a significant role in resolving workers' chronic diseases, reducing the disease rate among workers, and improving their physical health. The Southwest Second Workers' Sanatorium admitted 150 workers with various chronic diseases in February and March of this year, and 130 of them have recovered and returned to their production and work posts after recuperation. The Zhalantun Railway Sanatorium admitted 335 workers suffering from tuberculosis last year, and more than 200 of them have also recovered.

Currently, trade union organizations across the country run more than 150 sanatoriums and rest homes (not including those run by grassroots trade union organizations), with approximately 18,000 beds. If the quality is comprehensively rectified, consolidated, and improved, many workers with chronic diseases will receive recuperation each year, which will play a significant role in restoring workers' health and promoting production.

    全国总工会召开首次全国工会疗养院院长和休养所所长会议
    讨论如何提高现有疗养院质量问题
    中华全国总工会最近在青岛疗养区召开了第一次全国工会疗养院院长和休养所所长会议。中央人民政府卫生部、中国防痨协会等部门也派代表参加。
    这次会议贯彻三月份中华全国总工会召开的劳动保险会议所提出的工会疗养事业为生产服务为群众服务的方针，着重讨论和解决了如何整顿巩固和提高现有疗养院的质量问题。
    会议期间，西南第二工人疗养院、扎兰屯铁路疗养院、中国第二机械工会大连疗养院等七个单位出席人员介绍了关于整顿巩固和提高疗养院工作的经验。这些疗养院经过整顿后，对于解决职工的慢性病、降低职工疾病率、增进职工身体健康起了很大作用。西南第二工人疗养院今年二三月份收容患有各种慢性病的职工一百五十人，经过疗养后已有一百三十人恢复了健康，回到生产和工作岗位。扎兰屯铁路疗养院去年收容患肺结核病的职工三百三十五人，也有二百多人恢复了健康。
    现在全国工会组织举办的疗养院、休养所共有一百五十多处（不包括基层工会组织举办的在内），约一万八千多床位。如经全面整顿巩固提高质量后，每年将有很多患慢性病的职工得到疗养，对于恢复职工身体健康，推动生产，将起很大作用。
