Xinhua News Agency: The French National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on May 4th. Four inquiries submitted by members of parliament regarding the Indochina issue have been submitted to the Secretariat of the National Assembly.

"Le Monde" reported: Divisions exist within the French government regarding the Indochina issue. These divisions, which had become apparent earlier, were exposed again during the cabinet meeting on the evening of April 30th.

"Le Monde" pointed out: At that meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, with the support of Overseas Territories Minister Sommerfelt, suggested adopting a "relatively bold policy." Reynaud believes that at the beginning of the debate on the Indochina issue, a ceasefire in Indochina must be immediately requested through the mediation of a third country. Reynaud also advocated establishing contact with representatives of the Ho Chi Minh government immediately.

Reynaud's proposal was opposed by Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Maurice Schumann and Prime Minister Laniel.

    法国国民议会定期复会讨论印度支那问题
    据新华社讯：法国国民议会订于五月四日复会。议员们就印度支那问题提出的四点质询已提交国民议会秘书处。
    “世界报”报道：法政府内部在印度支那问题上存在着分歧。早些时候就已经明朗化的这些分歧，在四月三十日晚上的内阁会议上再度暴露了出来。
    “世界报”指出：在那次会议上，副总理保罗·雷诺在海外领地部部长夏季诺的支持下，建议采取一种“比较大胆的政策”。雷诺认为，印度支那问题的辩论一开始，就必须立刻要求通过第三国的斡旋在印度支那停火。雷诺还主张立即和胡志明政府的代表建立联系。
    雷诺的主张遭到外交部次长莫里斯·舒曼和拉尼埃总理的反对。
