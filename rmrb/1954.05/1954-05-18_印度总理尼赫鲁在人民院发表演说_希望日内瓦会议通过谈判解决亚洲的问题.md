Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on the 15th at the beginning of the foreign affairs debate in the Indian People's House.

Prime Minister Nehru emphasized that the current conference in Geneva is a very important one. He said: We see news every day about various proposals put forward by both sides, and sometimes the two attitudes seem diametrically opposed. However, first of all, the Geneva Conference is still meeting, and that fact alone is of great significance.

Nehru said that today at the Geneva Conference, the issue of war and peace is at a critical juncture. I don't want to say that war will suddenly descend upon us. I don't think things will be that way. However, due to the results of the Geneva Conference, it is very important whether many steps are taken towards peace, or whether the current stalemate continues, or whether things get worse. This is very important for all countries in the world. Naturally, this issue is of deep concern to the major powers. However, let everyone remember: the main issues being considered in Geneva, the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, are both Asian issues. Both of these countries are in Asia. Whether we are small or large countries, and whether we have any great military potential, what happens in Korea and Indochina is closely related to us as Asian countries. And because we are geographically close to Indochina, the Indochina issue is even more closely related to us. Unfortunately, for the past few hundred years, Asia has not only had colonial regimes, but has often become someone else's battlefield and the battlefield for others to wage war against it. Therefore, if we hope that this kind of war in Asia will stop, especially the kind of war that others wage in Asia for their own purposes, our wish is not unjustified. I have said on previous occasions that for us newly liberated Asian countries, peace is not only a devout hope, but an urgent necessity.

Prime Minister Nehru also said: Whether you are considering the Korean issue or the Indochina issue, the real question is to what extent we can seek a solution through negotiation. People can of course be inclined to this or that solution. That depends on the desire to find a solution, not on strength. Ultimately, no solution should be imposed on others except for the merits of the issue. If a solution is to be found, it must be sought through negotiation rather than through imposition.

Unfortunately, however, our wishes do not match the reality.

These issues are currently being discussed daily in Geneva. Even so, my feeling is this: there is a very sincere desire to find some kind of armistice and to find steps to try to resolve it in the future. I sincerely hope that some kind of gradual solution can be found. But, I say again, there can be no such move towards a solution unless it is sought through negotiation rather than imposition.

Referring to the issue of India and the Geneva Conference, Nehru said: Our consistent attitude is: not to force our participation; but at the same time not to isolate ourselves, saying that we are powerless, because this situation is closely related to us. This situation is closely related not only to us, but also to our Asian neighbors.

In any case, as far as we are concerned, we are earnestly watching the development of the situation, and if it is ever necessary, we will express our opinions privately. If there ever arises an occasion where we may be able to help promote a solution to the problem, we will give it the most careful consideration.

Prime Minister Nehru stated: I earnestly hope that the great and wise statesmen gathered in Geneva will find a solution to the problem. If they find a solution, I believe that other countries, wherever they may be, who do not want to force their way to Geneva, will be willing to help implement the solutions reached, of course, these solutions must truly be solutions. No country can help forcibly implement anything.

In today's world, we must accept the principle of live and let live. Do not interfere externally or internally. Let ideas flow freely, and let each country be itself. This is the only basis on which we can truly regain sanity and a sense of security.

Therefore, I earnestly hope that the efforts of the politicians in Geneva will lead to success. Although we clearly have the right—of course, as individuals or groups—to express our opinions and offer criticisms, I think we should all express our goodwill for this purpose.

    印度总理尼赫鲁在人民院发表演说
    希望日内瓦会议通过谈判解决亚洲的问题
    【新华社十七日讯】据印度新闻处讯：印度总理尼赫鲁十五日在印度人民院外交辩论开始时发表了演说。
    尼赫鲁总理强调目前正在日内瓦举行的会议是一个非常重要的会议。他说：我们每天都看到关于双方提出的各种不同的建议的消息，有时两种态度看来是截然相反的，然而，首先，日内瓦会议还在开会，单单这一事实就具有重要的意义。
    尼赫鲁说，今天在日内瓦会议上，战争与和平的问题处于紧要关头。我并不想说战争会忽然降临到我们的身上。我想事情是不会是那样的。然而，由于日内瓦会议的结果，究竟是采取了许多步骤走向和平，还是让目前的僵局继续下去，还是弄得更糟，这是很重要的。这对全世界的一切国家来说都是很重要的，自然，这个问题对各个大国有着深切的利害关系。然而，让大家记住：日内瓦正在考虑的主要问题，朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，都是亚洲问题。这两个国家都是在亚洲。不管我们是小国还是大国，也不管我们有没有任何巨大的军事潜力，朝鲜和印度支那发生的事情与身为亚洲国家的我们是有密切关系的。而由于我们和印度支那在地理上很接近，印度支那问题与我们的关系就更为密切。以往几百年以来，亚洲不幸得很，它不但有殖民政权，而且，常常成为别人的战场和别人对它进行战争的战场。因此，假如我们希望这种在亚洲进行战争的事情停止，特别是，别人为他们自己的目的在亚洲进行战争的事情，我们的这种愿望并不是不正当的。我在以前的场合已经说过，对我们新近获得自由的亚洲国家来说，和平不仅是虔诚的希望，而且是紧急的必要。
    尼赫鲁总理又说：不管你们是考虑朝鲜问题还是印度支那问题，真正的问题是我们能在多大的程度上用谈判的方法求得解决。人们当然可以倾向于这种或那种解决办法。那决定于要求解决的愿望而不是决定于实力。归根结蒂，除了问题的是非之外，不应把任何解决办法强加于他人身上。如果要求得解决，那就必须用谈判的方法而不是用强加的办法求解决。
    然而，不幸的是，我们的愿望与实际情况不相吻合。
    目前在日内瓦正在逐日讨论这些问题。虽然如此，我的感觉是这样的：寻找某种停战办法以及寻找将来设法解决的步骤的十分诚恳的愿望是存在的。我诚恳地希望能找到某种逐步地走向解决的办法。但是，我再说一遍，除非是用谈判的办法而不是用强加的办法去求得解决，否则便不可能有这种走向解决的办法。
    尼赫鲁在谈到印度和日内瓦会议问题时说：我们一贯的态度是：不强求参加进去；但同时也不使我们孤立起来，说我们无能为力，这是因为这种事态和我们有密切的关系。这种事态不单与我们，而且还与我们亚洲的邻邦都有密切关系。
    不管怎么样，就我们来说，我们正在诚恳地注视着事态的发展，要是一旦有必要时，我们就私下表示我们的意见，在一旦产生了我们也许能协助促进问题的解决的场合时，那我们将予以最慎重的考虑。
    尼赫鲁总理表示：我热诚地希望，在日内瓦聚集的伟大和明智的政治家将找出解决问题的办法。如果他们找出了解决办法，我相信，其他不想强求到日内瓦去的无论什么地方的国家将愿意帮助执行所达成的解决办法，当然，这些解决办法必须真是解决办法才行。没有任何国家能帮助强行实施任何东西。
    在今天的这个世界中，我们必须接受自己活也让别人活的办法。不要进行外部或内部的干涉。让思想自由交流，让每个国家自行其是。这是我们可以真正恢复清醒和安全感的唯一基础。
    因此，我热诚希望，在日内瓦的政治家的努力将导致成功。虽然我们显然有权——当然是作为个人或团体——表示我们的意见和提出批评，但我认为我们大家都应该为了这个目的而表示我们的善意。
