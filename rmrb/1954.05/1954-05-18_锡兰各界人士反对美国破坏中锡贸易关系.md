Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, May 15th: U.S. President Eisenhower recently extended an invitation to the Prime Minister of Ceylon, Kotelawala, to visit the United States. According to Ceylon newspaper reports, this action is related to the U.S. attempt to force Ceylon to abolish the Sino-Ceylon trade agreement, with the U.S. trying to achieve this despicable goal by giving Ceylon so-called economic "aid."

    Just as broad public opinion in Southeast Asia is increasingly strongly opposing U.S. interference in Asian affairs and demanding the abolition of the "embargo," this U.S. plot to undermine Sino-Ceylon trade relations and plunge the Ceylon economy back into crisis cannot but arouse fierce opposition from the Ceylon public. Ceylon's Leader of the House of Representatives, Bandaranaike, said on the 11th: "The U.S. proposal seems like a bribe to Ceylon to break the agreement between Ceylon and China." Peter Keuneman, a Communist Party member of the Ceylon Parliament and chairman of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, said that the whole country should protest against this despicable secret deal and tell the United States that Ceylon is not for sale. According to the Associated Press, ordinary members of the ruling United National Party of Ceylon also expressed opposition to abolishing trade relations between Ceylon and China.

    Ceylon business people, who still have vivid memories of the serious destruction suffered by the Ceylon rubber industry from the U.S. "embargo" and price-cutting policies not long ago, are extremely uneasy about this new U.S. plot. The Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Sinnathamby, said: "Indeed, the credibility of our country is at stake, and a moral issue is involved." Robert Sinnathamby, a member of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, believes: "We would regret any action to suspend the agreement with China. I see no benefit in exchanging the financial benefits we have already obtained for the U.S. lease policy." The results of a recent poll conducted by the "Ceylon Times" show that major sectors of the Ceylon business community oppose exchanging the abolition of the trade agreement between Ceylon and China for "U.S. aid."

    The "Ceylon Times" quoted a member of the Ceylon Cabinet as saying that if Ceylon abolished the trade agreement with China, Ceylon would be forced to rely entirely on U.S. "handouts" with no way out. This "handout" would stop if Ceylon did not follow U.S. policy in all aspects—especially in foreign policy.

    锡兰各界人士反对美国破坏中锡贸易关系
    【新华社十五日讯】科伦坡消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔最近向锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉发出了访问美国的邀请。据锡兰报纸消息说，这一行动和美国企图迫使锡兰废止中锡贸易协定有关，美国正企图以给予锡兰所谓经济“援助”来达到这一卑鄙目的。
    正当东南亚广大的公众舆论日益强烈地反对美国干涉亚洲事务和要求废除“禁运”的时候，美国这一阴谋破坏中锡贸易关系、重陷锡兰经济于危境的行动，不能不激起锡兰公众的猛烈反对。锡兰众议院领袖班达拉纳克十一日说：“美国的建议很像给锡兰一种贿赂，以便破坏锡兰和中国的协定。”锡兰议会共产党议员、锡兰工会联合会主席彼得·克尼曼说，全国应该抗议这种卑鄙的秘密勾当，并告诉美国，锡兰是不供出卖的。据美联社透露，锡兰执政党统一国民党的一般党员也表示反对废止锡兰和中国之间的贸易关系。
    锡兰企业界人士对于在不久前锡兰橡胶业所受到的美国“禁运”和压价政策的严重摧残记忆犹新，他们对美国这个新阴谋极为不安。锡兰商会主席沈纳那亚克说：“真的，我们国家的威信是处在危险中，这会牵涉到道义问题。”锡兰商会会员罗伯特·沈纳那亚克认为：“我们对任何中止与中国缔结的协定的行动都认为是遗憾的。我看不出用我们已获得的财政利益来换取美国的租借政策究竟有什么益处。”最近“锡兰时报”举行民意测验的结果表明，锡兰商界的主要部门都反对以废止锡兰和中国缔结的贸易协定来换取“美援”。
      “锡兰时报”援引锡兰内阁阁员的话指出：如果锡兰废止和中国的贸易协定，锡兰便等于破釜沉舟被迫完全依靠美国的“施舍”。如果锡兰不在各方面——特别是外交政策方面——都追随美国政策的话，这种“施舍”便会停止。
