Hegang Coal Mine Dongshan Shaft Project Underway with Tense Progress

The newly built Dongshan Shaft project at Hegang Coal Mine is underway with tense progress. The shaft is very large in scale, and the equipment is all the latest Soviet-style machinery. From mining to transportation, all heavy physical labor will be replaced by machinery. In the future, after the shaft is put into operation, it can produce high-quality raw coal and coking coal, providing a large amount of fuel for the iron and steel industry.

    鹤岗煤矿东山竖井工程紧张进行
    我国新建的鹤岗煤矿东山竖井工程正在紧张进行。竖井的规模很大，设备都是苏联最新式的机械，从开采到运输，一切笨重的体力劳动都将为机械所代替。将来竖井开工后，可生产质量优良的原煤和炼焦煤，供给钢铁工业大量的燃料。这是工人们正在用小吊车起吊钢材，安装井塔架。新华社稿　张戈摄
