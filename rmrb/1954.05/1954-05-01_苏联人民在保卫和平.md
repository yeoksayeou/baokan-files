    Soviet People in Defense of Peace
    Ai Aotiesiman, Representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Leader of Tractor Team
    Whenever I think of my Chinese friends who are building a new life, I cannot help but recall that unforgettable meeting. It was in the summer of 1953 when our delegation attended the World Women's Congress in Copenhagen. I represented the women of Soviet Estonia.
    Nearly two thousand delegates from about seventy countries gathered here. They all warmly and unanimously supported peace and friendship among the people of all countries. One of the touching events during those days was the meeting with the Chinese delegation. Here, I not only met Shen Jilan, a labor model from Shanxi Province and a member of the Chinese delegation, but also became close friends with her. She is the vice-chairman of the Xigou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, a kind and approachable person. She told me a lot about her own country, talking about the fighting and labor endeavors of the Chinese people. Shen Jilan tirelessly asked me about the situation in the Soviet Union. She was interested in everything about our country—the construction of tall buildings, the work of children's welfare agencies, the participation of women in state management, and the situation of collective farms in the young Soviet republics along the Baltic Sea.
    In the most prominent place in my room hangs a large photograph, a group photo of the congress delegates. Among them is my friend Shen Jilan from People's China. I often look at this photo. She is far away from me, thousands of miles away, but our hearts are connected. We are friends, and no force can separate us. We have a common sacred goal, a common ideal. The Soviet people and the Chinese people are both working for the happiness of mankind. They are doing their best to create a happy life for the working people, turning our vast land into fertile fields and lush gardens.
    We believe we will achieve this. Our people have established unprecedented feats in socialist construction. Now they are building communism with even greater enthusiasm and joy. Like in the past, we and the people of all countries in the world need peace now. That is why the Soviet people, at all congresses and meetings, orally or in writing, shout: We support peace, we desire that all people on earth can live in peace and friendship, that mothers do not have to worry about their children being threatened by bombing and shooting, that every upright person's family can live in prosperity, and that all people are committed to eliminating poverty, disease, and ignorance.
    We not only call for fighting for the cause of peace, but also strive daily to consolidate this noble cause with our own labor for the benefit of the motherland. We know that the more prosperous and consolidated the fortress of world peace—the Soviet Union—is, the more guaranteed it will be to stop warmongers and the more guaranteed the victory of the cause of peace and friendship among the people of all countries. This is why our people spare no effort to build new factories, new power stations, and fight for the upsurge of agriculture.
    I very much hope that my words can reach my dear friend Shen Jilan. We had agreed to write to each other about our labor, work, achievements, and all new things in life. What can I say about myself? I am still working at the Vilyandi Machine Tractor Station, leading a tractor team of the "Stalinlik Shepulus" (meaning "Stalinist Friendship") collective farm. In addition, when harvesting crops, I also work as a combine harvester operator.
    Now my team has just repaired all the tractors and will soon set off to work in the fields. This year, many new things have happened here. After the decision of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, many experts came to the village to work for the machine tractor station and the collective farm. New machines began to be transported here. Our team also received a new type of tractor—a potato planter. Using this machine, we can plant potatoes using the square-cluster planting method. This year, we should first arrange for the full mechanization of hay harvesting work in the collective farm we serve. New machines have been received, and we, agricultural machine operators, will use them for mowing, raking, and stacking hay.
    We are very busy now and are in an important season. We have just repaired the machines and are working hard to learn new technologies. The Party calls on us to rapidly improve agriculture. We will wholeheartedly and gloriously complete the noble tasks assigned to us by our beloved Party. The time when our country has abundant food and daily industrial products is not far away. Now all the Soviet people are working hard to complete this task.
    I would also like to talk about another new thing. Not long ago, I was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. I am very happy and proud of the people's trust in me. But I also know very well that the noble title of representative places a particularly heavy responsibility on me. Now I should be an example in both labor and life. I should become a persistent fighter for peace. This is my responsibility, and it is a mission that I am happy to undertake.

    苏联人民在保卫和平
    苏联最高苏维埃代表  拖拉机工作队队长  艾·奥特斯曼
    每当我想到正在建设新生活的中国朋友时，就不禁想起那次永不能令人忘怀的会见。那是在一九五三年夏天，我国代表团参加了在哥本哈根召开的世界妇女大会。我是代表苏联爱沙尼亚的妇女出席的。
    代表约七十个国家的近两千名代表集聚在这里。她们都热烈地一致拥护和平与各国人民的友谊。在那些日子里，动人的事件之一就是和中国代表团的会见。在这里我不但认识了中国代表团团员山西省劳动模范申纪兰，而且和她成了亲密的朋友。她是平顺县西沟村农业生产合作社的副社长，是一个和蔼可亲的人。她告诉了我许多关于她自己祖国的事情，谈到了中国人民的战斗和劳动事业。申纪兰不倦地一再向我询问苏联的情形。她对我国的一切都感到兴趣——高大的房屋的建筑、儿童福利机关的工作、妇女的参加国家管理工作以及波罗的海沿岸各年轻的苏维埃共和国中集体农庄的情况等。
    在我房间里最显著的地方挂着一幅大照片，是大会代表的合影。其中就有我的朋友——来自人民中国的申纪兰。我常常看这张照片。她离我很远，相距万里之遥，但是我们的心却连在一起。我们是朋友，任何力量都不可能使我们分开。我们有着共同的神圣的目的，共同的理想。苏联人民和中国人民都在为人类谋幸福。他们尽最大的努力为劳动者建立愉快的生活，使我们的辽阔土地变成肥沃的良田，变成繁茂的花园。
    我们相信我们会做到这一点。我国人民在社会主义建设中建立了史无前例的功绩。现在他们正以更大的热情欢欣鼓舞地建设着共产主义。像过去一样，我们和全世界各国人民现在也需要和平。正因为如此，苏维埃人才在一切大会上，各种会议上，用口头或书面高呼：我们拥护和平，我们渴望地球上所有的人都能在和平与友爱中生活，渴望母亲们不致为自己孩子受到炸死和枪杀的威胁而耽忧，每个正直的人的家庭都能生活得富裕，所有的人都致力于消除贫困、疾病和无知。
    我们不仅号召为和平事业而斗争，为了造福祖国，我们也在逐日地竭力以自己的劳动来巩固这一崇高的事业。我们知道，世界和平堡垒——苏联越富饶，越巩固，便越能保证制止战争挑拨者，越能保证和平和各国人民友好的事业的胜利。这就是我国人民不遗余力地建设新工厂、新电力站，为农业高涨而斗争的原因。
    我非常希望我的话能传到我的可爱的朋友申纪兰那里。我们曾相互约定要写信叙述自己的劳动、工作、成就和生活中的一切新事物。关于我自己有什么可说的呢？我还和过去一样在维里扬德机器拖拉机站工作，领导着“斯大林里克·设普路斯”
  （意即“斯大林式的友谊”）集体农庄的一个拖拉机工作队。此外，当收割庄稼的时候，我也担任联合收割机操使者的工作。
    现在我这一队刚刚把拖拉机都修理好，不久就要出发到田间工作去了。今年我们这里发生了许多新事情。在苏共中央一九五三年九月全会决议以后，有不少专家来到村里为机器拖拉机站和集体农庄工作。开始运来新式机器。我们的工作队也得到了一部新式拖拉机——马铃薯栽种机。利用这种机器，我们可以用方形穴种法来栽种马铃薯。今年我们首先应当在我们服务的这个集体农庄里布置好收割干草工作的全面机械化。新机器已经收到，我们，农业机器操使者将利用它们来进行刈草、耙草和堆草。
    现在我们非常忙，正处在重要的季节。我们刚修好了机器，正在顽强地学习掌握新技术。党号召我们要迅速提高农业。我们将以全力光荣地完成亲爱的党交给我们的崇高任务。我国有丰裕的食品和日用工业品的时间，已为时不远了。现在全体苏联人民都在为完成这个任务而努力工作着。
    我还想再谈一件新事。不久前我当选为苏联最高苏维埃的代表。我非常快乐，并以人民对我的信任而自豪。但是我也非常清楚地知道，代表的高贵称号使我负有特别重大的责任。现在我无论在劳动，在生活上都更应当做表率。我应当成为一个坚持不懈的和平斗士。这是我的责任，也是我所乐于担负的使命。
