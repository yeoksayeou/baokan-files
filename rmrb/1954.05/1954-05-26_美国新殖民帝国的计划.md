The U.S. Neo-Colonial Empire Plan
　　By our correspondents Li Zhuang and Du Bo
　　Among the series of destructive activities by the U.S. ruling clique, which fears peace and obstructs the smooth progress of the Geneva Conference, the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" plan is the most prominent and worthy of close attention recently. As the activities of imperialist politicians on both sides of the Atlantic become more frequent, and American and French diplomats, military personnel, etc., are busy traveling between Washington, Paris, and Saigon, Western newspapers have recently used many pages to discuss this matter, and put forward various suggestions for this increasingly planned aggressive group. Some say that the Geneva Conference should be broken up as soon as possible so that the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" can be formed, while others say that this plan should be implemented quickly before the Geneva Conference is over. Some have even spread the deadline for the treaty. On May 19, "Paris Radical News" reported: "The military alliance being prepared in Southeast Asia is the necessary legal form for the United States to carry out armed intervention in Indochina." On May 19, U.S. President Eisenhower publicly declared that this Asian version of the European Defense Group is the basis of his "policy."
　　Regardless of the name, whether it is the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" or the "Pacific Common Security System," the idea of the United States wanting to organize a colonialist aggressive group in Asia (currently in Southeast Asia) that is hostile to the Asian people is not new. Not to mention the distant past, during the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon had planned such a Pacific group; shortly after the Korean Armistice Agreement was formally signed, in October 1953, U.S. Vice President Nixon "traveled" to the Far East, the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East to prepare for the organization of the so-called "Pacific Security System."
　　After the Berlin Conference, due to the initiative of the Soviet Foreign Minister, decided to convene the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochina issues, the U.S. ruling clique feared peace, and the planning of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" was particularly intensified. This situation can be explained by Dulles' so-called "united action" on March 29. Dulles' "united action" was not only rejected and indignantly protested by people all over the world, especially the people of Asian countries, but was also treated coldly even among the allies of the United States. Therefore, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, Dulles hurriedly made a "lightning trip" to London and Paris, on the one hand, trying his best to obstruct the conference and poison the atmosphere of the conference, and on the other hand, continuing to put pressure on Britain and France, restricting their negotiating hands. However, the Geneva Conference, which finally began amid the threats and deceptions of the United States, had a good atmosphere in the early stages, contrary to the wishes of the United States, due to the first participation of the People's Republic of China and the sincere consultation attitude of the representatives of China and the Soviet Union. It was under such circumstances that Dulles left Geneva amid the ridicule of the Western press, which considered it "the biggest failure in American diplomatic history."
　　After Dulles left the meeting, the conspiracy of U.S. political figures in power to plan the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" to undermine the Geneva Conference not only did not diminish at all, but intensified. From deliberately finding excuses on the issue of the evacuation of seriously wounded prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu to the recent widely reported U.S.-French talks, this is the latest development in this conspiracy. According to press reports, the U.S.-French talks, as a prelude to planning the "Southeast Asia Defense Group," are actively underway in Washington, between Dulles and French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet, in Paris, between U.S. Ambassador to France Dillon and Laniel, and in Geneva, between Smith and Bidault. The U.S.-French talks even went behind the backs of their allies - Britain. Eisenhower publicly stated: The Southeast Asia group can proceed without Britain's participation. This shows how anxious the gentlemen in Washington are to put together an aggressive group in Asia as soon as possible. At the same time, U.S. Defense Secretary Wilson is visiting the Far East, French Chief of Staff Ely hurriedly flew to Saigon, and French Expeditionary Force Commander Navarre, who was discredited by the defeat at Dien Bien Phu, also shouted the demand for the "internationalization" of the Indochina War a few days ago. Not only that, but the United States has recently intensified its pressure on Australia and New Zealand, two countries that are not in Southeast Asia. So far, there are varying rumors about which countries are included in the U.S. organization of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group." According to press reports, the original intention of the United States was to include the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and three puppet countries such as Bao Dai, plus Thailand and the Philippines, a total of ten countries (according to the United States' intention, it also hoped to include Syngman Rhee and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang). Dulles hastily convened a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Australia, and New Zealand on May 2, the day before he left Geneva, which was said to be mainly to discuss this plan. At the same time, Dulles and later Smith held several separate meetings with Eden, describing the "convention" being prepared as "changing the past situation where the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand convention excluded Britain," to lure Britain into joining. Due to the opposition of the British people, the Churchill government twice expressed its opinion that "it will not participate before the end of the Geneva Conference." Then, on the 19th, Eisenhower announced at a press conference: "It can proceed without Britain's participation," in order to intimidate Britain. Parisian newspapers commented on this matter: "This kind of broad international alliance organization, without Britain's participation, is still the first time in the post-war Western world." While continuing to intimidate Britain, the United States blackmailed France, demanding that France give up its position and interests in Indochina, but at the same time, France should mobilize its troops from mainland France and stationed in West Germany and North Africa to the Far East, so that under the command of the United States, it can serve as cannon fodder in the continued and expanded colonial war in Indochina. In this way, the so-called military and political stages of the "Southeast Asia Convention," staff meetings and "ministerial" meetings, etc., have filled the pages of Western newspapers recently. Western newspapers have also reported that the United States hopes to come up with something similar to a "joint statement" during the Geneva Conference.
　　Now, people can't help but ask: What exactly is the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" that the U.S. ruling clique is so hurriedly preparing?
　　The U.S. preparation of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group," in its current direct significance, is to undermine the discussion on the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, that is, to continue and expand the Indochina War, further intensify armed intervention and seize France's interests in Indochina. The U.S. press has been openly talking about, on the one hand, organizing the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" as a means to undermine the Geneva Conference, and on the other hand, if the Geneva Conference is broken up, it will remove obstacles to the formation of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group."
　　But if you think that the U.S. preparation of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" is only a temporary measure, then that would be too naive. The fact is that the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" plan is a deliberate and long-planned intention of the U.S. ruling clique. Stripping off the outer clothing of its hypocritical words, the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" is part of the U.S.'s naked and sinful plan to enslave the Asian people and establish its new colonial empire in Asia. Eisenhower and Dulles have emphasized more than once how rich the deposits are in the Southeast Asia region and how attractive these minerals and resources are to Wall Street monopoly capitalists. At the same time, in order to clear the way for it to establish a colonial empire, the United States must expand colonial wars in Asia, and drive the Asian people to kill each other for the interests of a few U.S. monopoly capitalists, and use the blood and corpses of "Asians fighting Asians" to raise the throne of Washington's new colonialism.
　　While striving to establish a new colonial empire, the U.S. imperialists must naturally also squeeze out the status of old colonial countries such as Britain and France, encompass their original interests in Asia, and replace them. Not to mention the many facts that Britain has lost its position in its autonomous territories and colonies to the United States one by one in the nine years after the war, just take the conditions recently revealed by the Western press in the U.S.-French negotiations, in which the United States put forward the conditions for further intervention in Indochina, and you can understand it. These conditions are said to be that the training of the puppet army and the command of operations must be handed over to the United States, and at the same time, it is proposed that the three federal member states should be allowed to "independently" and the Bao Dai regime should be "democratized," that is to say, the Bao Dai and other puppet regimes should be transferred from France to the United States, making them direct tools in the hands of U.S. imperialism.
　　Not only that, but this "Southeast Asia Convention" to establish its new colonial empire to enslave the Asian people is still a component of the U.S. imperialist plan to seize world hegemony and prepare for world war. Just like it organized the European military convention in Europe, the U.S. ruling clique now wants to form such a Southeast Asia or Pacific aggressive military alliance convention in Asia, in order to implement its trick of "the United States pays money and guns, and the Asians provide people and labor," so that the Asian people kill each other, so that Wall Street can seize high profits.
　　But this old plan and new conspiracy of U.S. imperialism is completely exposing its aggressive face to the people of the world, and is thus suffering increasing opposition. First of all, the people of Asian countries will not allow it to do so. The reality of Asia in the 1950s is that colonialism has reached the declining period of sunset. The victory of the Chinese people and the growth and strength of the People's Republic of China are inspiring the people of all Asian countries who love freedom and safeguard national rights; the strength of the struggle of the Korean people and the Indochinese people for national independence is increasing, and they are willing to seek peaceful solutions through consultation on the condition of recognizing national rights, which is a manifestation of this strength and political maturity. The days when the imperialists thought that the Asian people could be deceived and arbitrarily enslaved and slaughtered are long gone. Anyone who does not recognize this historical fact will surely be battered and bruised. The more than three years of the Korean War and the more than seven years of the Indochina War are the most recent obvious examples.
　　What is especially ridiculous about the "Southeast Asia Group" planned by the United States is that, apart from the three puppet countries such as Bao Dai plus Thailand, it does not actually include any other countries in the Southeast Asia region. Any Asian country with a little national self-esteem despises it. The countries that account for the vast majority of the population in the Southeast Asia region, including India, Burma, and Indonesia, are not only not interested in this U.S.-made "Southeast Asia Convention" at all, but Asian political figures such as Indian Prime Minister Nehru have repeatedly expressed their legitimate concerns about the dangerous consequences that this planned convention will have on peace in the Southeast Asia region. Because of this, Western newspapers believe that the Colombo Conference is bad news for the United States.
　　The U.S. plan to prepare the "Southeast Asia Group" and establish a new colonial empire also harms the interests of Britain, France, and other countries, thereby deepening the disputes between the United States and these old colonial countries. Phrases such as "opposing communist aggression" and "the unity of the free world" cannot conceal the aggressive true face of U.S. imperialism, which is cleverly seizing and plundering and harming others for its own benefit. More and more British and French political figures have expressed their unwillingness to be deceived by the United States anymore. The Laniel-Bidault cabinet, which was able to maintain its existence by relying on two votes bought at the last moment, even though it still fantasizes that it may continue to follow the United States, has to consider the pressure of the people from a wide range of classes in the country and the members of parliament encompassing all parties, as well as public opinion.
　　The U.S. plan to prepare the "Southeast Asia Group" directly contradicts the original spirit of the Geneva Conference. It is not to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but to keep the Korean armistice in an unstable state; it is not to restore peace in Indochina, but to continue and expand the Indochina War; it is not to respect the national rights of the Asian people, but to enslave the Asian people and establish a new colonial empire for the United States in Asia; it is not to consolidate peace in Asia and further ease the international tension, but to expand aggressive wars in Asia and aggravate the tension in international relations. This practice of the U.S. ruling clique, which completely ignores the peace aspirations of the people of the world, is arousing opposition from all kind people around the world.
　　As for the Asian people, their wish is definitely not to be slaves under the U.S. colonial empire, nor to be used by it to kill each other, but to live in national independence and freedom, and to coexist peacefully and friendly with the people of all countries. Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Geneva Conference, said at the two meetings on April 28 and May 8: "Asian countries should consult with each other and make joint efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia by assuming corresponding obligations." This statement has aroused and is arousing widespread responses from Asian countries, especially Southeast Asian countries. In the past ten days, Asian public opinion and progressive public opinion around the world have believed that this statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out the bright road for the Asian people and accurately reflected the legitimate aspirations of the Asian and world people for the Geneva Conference to consolidate peace in Asia and further ease international tensions.

    美国新殖民帝国的计划
    本报记者　李庄　杜波
    在美国统治集团害怕和平、阻挠日内瓦会议顺利进行的一连串破坏活动中，所谓“东南亚防御公约”的计划是最近以来最突出和值得人们密切注视的一件事。随着大西洋两岸帝国主义政客们活动的愈益频繁，美国和法国外交家、军人等在华盛顿、巴黎和西贡之间忙碌奔走，西方报纸最近也用许多篇幅纷纷讨论着这件事，并替这一加紧筹划中的侵略集团提出各种各样的条陈，不是说要使日内瓦会议尽速破裂以便“东南亚防御集团”能够组成，就是说这一计划在日内瓦会议还没有结束之前就应该赶快实现起来，有的甚至传出了订约的限期。十九日“巴黎激进新闻”报说：“准备中的东南亚军事同盟，乃是美国在印度支那进行武装干涉所必需的法律形式”。五月十九日美国总统艾森豪威尔更公开宣称：这一个亚洲版的欧洲防务集团，乃是他的
  “政策的基础”。
    不管用什么名称，“东南亚防御公约”也罢，
  “太平洋共同安全体系”也罢，美国想在亚洲（在目前则是在东南亚）组织一个与亚洲人民为敌的殖民主义侵略集团的念头，并不是什么新的东西。远的不说，就在美国侵朝战争期间，美国国务院和五角大楼就曾策划过这种太平洋集团；在朝鲜停战协定正式签字后不久，一九五三年十月，美国副总统尼克松到远东、太平洋、东南亚以及中东各地“旅行”，就着手筹备组织所谓“太平洋安全体系”。
    在柏林会议由于苏联外长的倡议决定了召开讨论和平解决朝鲜和印度支那问题的日内瓦会议以后，美国统治集团害怕和平，对于“东南亚防御集团”的筹划也跟着特别加紧起来。这种情况，可以从三月二十九日杜勒斯所谓“联合行动”的叫嚣中得到说明。杜勒斯的“联合行动”不仅在全世界人民特别是亚洲各国人民中遭到唾弃和愤慨的抗议，而且即令在美国的盟邦中也受到冷淡的对待。因此，就在日内瓦会议前夕，杜勒斯还匆匆忙忙地到伦敦和巴黎作“闪电旅行”，一方面企图在阻挠会议、毒化会议气氛上尽他最后的努力，另一方面继续压迫英法，束缚住他们谈判的手脚。但是，在美国的恫吓与欺诈声中终于开始举行了的日内瓦会议，由于第一次有了中华人民共和国的参加，更由于中国和苏联的代表抱定真诚协商的态度，在开会初期出现了与美国愿望相反的良好气氛。就在这种情况下，杜勒斯在西方报界认为“美国外交史上最大一次失败”的嘲弄声中离开了日内瓦。
    在杜勒斯离会后，美国当权的政治人物筹划 “东南亚防御集团”以破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋不但没有丝毫收敛，反而变本加厉了。从奠边府重伤战俘撤退问题上故意寻找借口起，到近来报界盛传的美法会谈，便是这一阴谋的最近发展。根据报界消息，作为筹划“东南亚防御集团”的前奏的美法会谈，正在华盛顿，在杜勒斯与法国驻美大使庞纳之间，在巴黎，在美国驻法大使狄龙与拉尼埃之间，和在日内瓦，在史密斯与皮杜尔之间积极进行中。美法会谈甚至不惜背着他们的盟国——英国进行。艾森豪威尔并公开表示：东南亚集团没有英国参加也可以进行。这表现了华盛顿老爷们对于在亚洲赶紧拼凑出一个侵略集团来的心境，是多么着急。与此同时，美国国防部长威尔逊正在远东访问，法国参谋长埃利匆匆飞到西贡去，因奠边府失败而弄得声名狼藉的法国远征军司令纳瓦尔前几天也在高喊印度支那战争“国际化”的要求。不仅如此，美国最近对澳大利亚和新西兰这两个并不在东南亚的国家，也加紧其压力。到现在为止，关于美国组织 “东南亚防御集团”的成员究竟包括那些国家的问题，传说不一。根据报界消息，美国原来的打算是包括美、英、法、澳、新及保大等三个傀儡国，加上泰国和菲律宾，共十国（按照美国的打算还希望甚至能够包括李承晚和蒋介石匪帮在内）。杜勒斯在离开日内瓦前一天，即五月二日，曾匆忙地召开了一次美澳新三国外长的会议，据说主要的便是商讨这种方案。同时，杜勒斯以及后来史密斯曾与艾登进行多次个别会谈，把筹组中的“公约”说成是“可以改变过去美澳新公约排斥英国在外的情况”，来引诱英国入伙。由于英国人民的反对，邱吉尔政府两次表示了“在日内瓦会议未结束以前不参加”的意见。接着，便是十九日艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上宣布：“没有英国参加也可以进行”，借以恫吓英国。巴黎报纸评论这件事情时说：“这种广泛的国际性同盟组织，没有英国参加，在战后西方世界中还是第一次。”美国一面继续恫吓英国，一面对法国进行讹诈，要法国让出其在印度支那的地位和利益，但同时还要法国调动其法国本部以及驻西德和北非的部队到远东去，以便在美国指挥之下，在继续和扩大的印度支那殖民战争中充当炮灰。这样，关于“东南亚公约”的所谓军事阶段和政治阶段，参谋会议和“部长级”会议等等传说，充斥了近来西方报纸的篇幅。西方报纸并且传出消息，美国希望在日内瓦会议期间至少能够先搞出一个类似“联合声明”那样的东西来。
    现在，人们不禁要问：美国统治集团这样急急忙忙地在筹措的所谓“东南亚防御集团”，究竟是
  一个什么东西呢？
    美国筹措“东南亚防御集团”，就其当前的直接意义来说，是为了破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的讨论，也就是说是为了继续和扩大印度支那战争，进一步加紧武装干涉并攫取法国在印度支那的利益。美国报界一直就在公开谈论，一方面以组织“东南亚防御集团”作为破坏日内瓦会议的手段，另一方面如果日内瓦会议竟告破裂，那末这将给“东南亚防御集团”的组成扫除障碍。
    但如果以为美国筹组“东南亚防御集团”仅仅是一个临时性的措施，那便是太天真的想法了。事实是“东南亚防御集团”计划乃是美国统治集团处心积虑、蓄意已久的打算，剥开它虚伪言辞的外衣，“东南亚防御集团”乃是美国赤裸裸地奴役亚洲人民，在亚洲建立其新的殖民帝国的罪恶计划的一部分。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯曾经不止一次地强调，在东南亚地区有着如何丰富的蕴藏和这些矿藏和富源对于华尔街独占资本家如何具有吸引力。同时，美国为了替它建立殖民帝国扫清道路，就必须在亚洲扩大殖民战争，并驱使亚洲人民为了美国少数独占资本家的利益而互相残杀，用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的鲜血和尸骸，填高华盛顿新殖民主义的宝座。
    美帝国主义者在其力求建立新的殖民帝国的同时，自然还必须排挤掉英法等那些旧的殖民国家的地位，囊括他们原在亚洲的利益，并取而代之。且不说在战后九年来，英国怎样在美国手中一个又一个地丧失它在自治领和殖民地中的地位的许多事实，单拿最近西方报界所透露的，美法谈判中美国提出进一步干涉印度支那的条件就可以明白了。这些条件，据说是对伪军的训练和对作战的指挥权都要让给美国，同时还提出法方应允许三个联邦成员国“独立”，和使保大政权“民主化”，也就是说使保大等傀儡政权从法国手中转给美国，使其成为美帝国主义手里的直接工具。
    不仅如此，为建立其新的殖民帝国以奴役亚洲人民的这一“东南亚公约”，还是美帝国主义攫取世界霸权，准备世界战争的整个计划的组成部分。像它在欧洲组织欧洲军公约一样，美国统治集团现在想在亚洲组成这么一个东南亚或太平洋的侵略性军事同盟公约，借以贯彻它的“美国出钱出枪，亚洲人出人出力”的诡计，使亚洲人民互相残杀，从而使华尔街攫得高利。
    但是美国帝国主义这种旧的计划和新的阴谋，正把它自己侵略的面目完全暴露在全世界人民面前了，从而正遭受着愈来愈大的反对。首先是亚洲各国人民不允许它这样做。二十世纪五十年代的亚洲现实情况，是殖民主义已到了日暮途穷的没落时期。中国人民的胜利，中华人民共和国的成长和强大，鼓舞着全亚洲爱好自由、维护民族权利的各国人民；朝鲜人民和印度支那人民争取民族独立的斗争的力量正日益增强，他们愿意在承认民族权利的条件下经过协商求得和平解决，正是这种力量强大和政治上成熟的表现。帝国主义者认为亚洲人民可欺，可以任意奴役残杀的日子是早已一去不复返了。谁要是不承认这一个历史事实，谁就一定碰得头破血流。三年多的朝鲜战争和七年多的印度支那战争，就是最近的明显例子。
    美国筹划的“东南亚集团”尤其可笑的地方，是除了保大等三个傀儡国家加上泰国以外，实际上并不包括任何东南亚地区的其他国家。稍有民族自尊心的亚洲国家，都对它加以鄙弃。占东南亚地区人口绝大多数的国家，包括印度、缅甸、印尼等在内，不仅对于这一美国造的“东南亚公约”丝毫不感兴趣，而且像印度总理尼赫鲁等亚洲的政治人物，对于这一计划中的公约将对东南亚地区的和平造成怎样危险的后果，一再表示了他们正当的忧虑。正因为如此，西方报纸都认为科伦坡会议对于美国说来，是一个坏消息。
    美国筹组“东南亚集团”，建立新的殖民帝国的计划，也危害了英法等国的利益，从而加深了美国与这些旧的殖民国家之间的争执。“反对共产主义侵略”、“自由世界的团结一致”等的辞句，怎么也掩盖不了美帝国主义巧取豪夺、损人利己的侵略真面目。愈来愈多的英法政治人物表示不愿再受美国的骗了。依靠最后时刻收买来的两票，得以保持存在的拉尼埃—皮杜尔内阁，纵然还幻想也许可以继续跟着美国走，却也不得不考虑到国内广泛阶层人民和包罗一切党派的议员以及舆论的压力。
    美国筹组“东南亚集团”的计划，是与日内瓦会议的原有精神直接相抵触的。不是和平解决朝鲜问题，而是使朝鲜停战继续保持不稳定状态；不是恢复印度支那和平，而是继续和扩大印度支那战争；不是尊重亚洲人民民族权利，而是奴役亚洲人民，建立美国在亚洲的新的殖民帝国；不是巩固亚洲和平，进一步缓和国际紧张局势，而是在亚洲扩大侵略战争，加剧国际关系的紧张。美国统治集团的这种完全无视全世界人民和平愿望的做法，正引起了全世界一切善良人们的反对。
    至于亚洲人民，他们的愿望决不是充当美国殖民帝国下的奴隶，也不是被他利用而互相残杀，而是在民族独立和自由中生活，在和平与友好的关系中与各国人民共处。中华人民共和国出席日内瓦会议代表团首席代表周恩来外长在四月二十八日和五月八日两次会议上，都曾说过：“亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。”这一个声明已经引起了并且正引起着亚洲国家，特别是东南亚各国广泛的响应。过去十多天来，亚洲各国舆论和全世界各地进步舆论，都认为周恩来外长的这个声明指出了亚洲人民的光明大道，确切地反映了亚洲和全世界人民对于日内瓦会议所寄托的巩固亚洲和平，进一步缓和国际紧张局势的正当愿望。
