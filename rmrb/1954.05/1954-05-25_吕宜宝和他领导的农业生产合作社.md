Lü Yibao and the Agricultural Production Cooperative He Leads
Tāo Guāng

At 4:30 in the morning, the "ding-dong" of the bell awakens the people. Cooperative members quickly put on their clothes, harness the livestock, and head to the fields. The day's intense labor passes. After dinner, everyone gathers at the cooperative in small groups. The accountant records the day's labor based on the production daily report. The production team leader and experienced veteran cooperative members squat in the corner, planning the next day's work; the youths gather around the "insurance" lamp, starting their collective study of literacy and agricultural techniques.

This is an agricultural production cooperative. The cooperative director, Lü Yibao, is a junior high school student. When you mention this young director, the cooperative members praise him repeatedly. Some say, "The director never shirks hard work, always takes on the tough jobs, truly puts in effort!" Others say, "The director is truly dedicated to the affairs of our cooperative, and often tells us about socialism, always using persuasion and education." These two sentences capture the main characteristics of Lü Yibao's work.

Lü Yibao was originally a student at Jinzhou Middle School. In the spring of 1950, he suspended his studies due to family problems. Leaving the classroom, he first considered his future. He was unwilling to stay in the countryside: "Being a farmer means muddy hands and feet, it's so hopeless!" He wanted to find a job in the city, no matter what. However, he stayed in Jinzhou for forty or fifty days without finding work. He went to Jinzhou five times, each time returning disappointed. Back home, he felt ashamed, shutting himself in his room all day, as if he had done something wrong, afraid to face people. He thought: Is this the end of my life's prospects? His thinking was, of course, wrong. The Party branch and the Communist Youth League branch quickly learned of his concerns and cared for him greatly, providing him with patient education. He Pengling, the Party branch secretary, talked to him several times, educating him to settle down and participate in agricultural production. The Youth League absorbed him and other members to study together. Under these circumstances, he reluctantly participated in production, working for his family on and off. He lived like this for two years in a muddled state.

In the spring of 1952, the village launched socialist propaganda and education, calling on farmers to take the path of organization. In that year, his family joined a mutual aid team. Through collective labor, he slowly changed his view of labor and began to enjoy agricultural production. During this period, the Party and the Communist Youth League organization never stopped educating him, often lending him books and urging him to actively participate in production. He felt how kind and caring the Party and the League were to a young person, and his enthusiasm for production increased. Soon, he joined the Communist Youth League. From that time on, he never wanted to leave agricultural production.

After this, he participated in the county labor model conference and the Party rectification study. This gave him a great education. He was deeply moved by the Party and the government's care for labor models; the Party committee's report on the socialist future of the countryside and the report of Liu Hongda, a Liaoxi Province agricultural labor model's visit to the Soviet Union, touched his heart. This time he truly recognized the glory of labor and understood that despising labor was the ideology of the exploiting class. His heart also brightened: a socialist society is right before our eyes! After returning from the study, he pledged to the Party: to resolutely follow the path of mutual aid and cooperation under the leadership of the Party, and to contribute all his strength to the realization of agricultural collectivization. He was determined to develop the mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative. He publicized the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, the superiority of cooperatives, the socialist future of the countryside... He tirelessly publicized to individual farmers with ideological problems repeatedly. Finally, with the approval of the Party committee, their sixteen-household agricultural production cooperative was established. He was elected as the cooperative director.

The cooperative has been established for more than a year and has achieved success. Last year, the cooperative's grain harvest exceeded the average annual yield by thirty percent. Lü Yibao summarized more than a year of experience, saying: "To do a good job in the cooperative's production, two things must be done: first, the situation in the cooperative must be reported to the district committee frequently, striving for the leadership of the Party committee; second, be determined to study, learn from the old farmers, and learn from practice."

Lü Yibao is diligent in learning in the process of leading the agricultural production cooperative. For example, during the harvest season, he was covered in sweat, but still couldn't keep up with the average cooperative member. He humbly learned from the members, and in a few days, Lü Yibao was running at the front. He regularly studies pamphlets such as "Agricultural Techniques", learns from the increased production experience of other regions from newspapers, and teaches what he learns to the members. This year, their cooperative planted a portion of peanuts. Everyone didn't understand the techniques for planting peanuts, so Lü Yibao learned from cadres in peanut-producing areas, returned to the cooperative, and taught the members. Lü Yibao has a certain level of education and accepts new things quickly. He carefully studied the increased production experience of Zhaoyuan. Last year, when planting corn, the members didn't believe in the benefits of close planting and advocated intercropping beans in the middle of the corn, saying that sparsely planted corn would yield more grain. Lü Yibao planted a portion of the land in this way, and implemented close planting on another portion of the land. As a result, the cornfield with intercropped beans yielded an average of more than three dou less per mu than the closely planted land. The members have since believed in the benefits of close planting. Last year, the cooperative bought half a set of new-style horse-drawn farm tools, but they were not fully utilized. Some said: "It's not necessarily useful" expressing doubts; some said: "We have few livestock, afraid we can't handle it." Lü Yibao patiently explained the benefits of horse-drawn farm tools. The cooperative is now using the new farm tools to plow the land.

As a leader of an agricultural production cooperative, Lü Yibao takes the lead in labor everywhere and pays attention to ideological education for the members. Last spring, when digging wells to fight drought, the first well was dug more than three zhang deep, requiring someone to go down to dig the spring. At that time, the weather was still cold, and no one wanted to go down. He jumped down without hesitation, and others followed. One afternoon, there was a downpour. He was sick, but suddenly thought of the cooperative's adobe pile. He put on his clothes and led the members through the heavy rain to cover the adobe pile. During the autumn harvest, the soybeans in a piece of land north of the village were not hauled back because the vehicles were busy. At night, he was worried about the soybeans, and went with Vice Director He Kuiwu to guard the field for a few days. The members said: The director works all day and guards the soybeans at night, he really values the cooperative's property! Taking Lü Yibao as an example, everyone also cherished public property. One day, in the middle of the night, there was heavy rain. Guo Zhanmin, who lived half a li away from the cooperative, got up and ran to the cooperative in the rain to cover the farm tools to prevent them from getting wet. Because everyone cares about their cooperative, everything in the cooperative is constantly improving. Lü Yibao also uses every opportunity to carry out socialist propaganda and education for the members. This year, the cooperative absorbed a portion of new members, expanding to twenty-six households. When preparing for plowing, some new members lacked confidence in increasing production and were not working hard. Lü Yibao used the rest time after labor every day to repeatedly explain the general task, the cooperative charter, and used pictures of Soviet agricultural collectivization to explain the bright future of the countryside. He also mobilized the members to discuss the conditions for increasing production, draw up production plans and labor discipline, and established regular life review meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Now, the members' collective consciousness has gradually strengthened, their awareness has improved, and their enthusiasm has been brought into play. Cooperative member Lü Wenhe was half-hearted when he first joined the cooperative, afraid of wasting a year. Now he says: "The cooperative is really good, everyone discusses everything, we do what whoever knows best, how can we not increase production! As a member, I can often participate in meetings to discuss issues, help each other, and my awareness is also high." Sun Baolin often talked about the "superiority" of individual farming when he first joined the cooperative, and his production enthusiasm was insufficient. Now he doesn't even mention the word "individual farming." In the process of hauling soil, he proposed a suggestion to improve the labor organization, increasing soil hauling efficiency by thirty-four percent. Lü Wenru used to be unmotivated and very lax in his work. Due to regular participation in collective learning, he has also changed. Now, when he drives the cart to deliver manure, he always carries a manure basket. If a piece of manure falls off the cart, he will pick it up and throw it back on the cart. When chopping bean stalks, some bean grains were scattered on the ground. While others went to eat and rest, he went to pick up the bean grains, picking up more than one dou of beans for the cooperative in total.

On January 15th of this year, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government made a decision to reward Lü Yibao, calling on intellectuals, middle school and complete primary school graduates in rural areas throughout the province to learn from Lü Yibao. After this decision and Lü Yibao's deeds were published in newspapers such as "China Youth Daily" and "Liaoxi Daily," they quickly spread throughout the province and the country. Intellectual youths from Beijing, Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and the Northeast, as well as soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, wrote letters to Lü Yibao, encouraging each other to strive for better construction and defense of the motherland. Letters from youth education workers said: We have found living materials for conducting labor education for students. Many students wrote letters examining their own ideas of despising labor, expressing their determination to dedicate themselves to the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The rewards from the People's Government and the encouragement from the vast number of youths have given Lü Yibao unlimited strength. He repeatedly stated: To further improve political awareness, humbly learn, closely connect with the masses, and run the agricultural production cooperative better. He said: "I will resolutely listen to the Party, study and study again, advance and advance again! To contribute all my strength to the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture."

Four years ago, Lü Yibao was just an ordinary junior high school student; two years ago, he was still an intellectual youth who was uneasy with agricultural labor; now, he has become an excellent agricultural cooperative director, leading the agricultural production cooperative very well. From him, we see how a rural intellectual youth grows up in labor.

    吕宜宝和他领导的农业生产合作社
    韬光
    清晨四点三十分，“当当”的钟声把人们唤醒了。社员们迅速地穿上衣服、套上牲口，到田野里去了。一天的紧张劳动过去了。吃过晚饭，大家又三三五五向合作社走来。会计根据生产日报表，把一天的劳动记录下来。生产队长和有经验的老社员，蹲在屋角落里，计划明天的工作；青年们围着
  “保险”灯，开始集体学习文化和农业技术了。
    这里是一个农业生产合作社。合作社主任吕宜宝，是一个初中学生。提起这位年轻的主任，社员们都连声称赞。有的说：“主任干啥活都不拿轻躲重，啥活不好干他干啥，真下力气！”有的说：“主任对我们社里大家的事真用心，还常给我们讲社会主义，啥事都是说服教育。”这两句话道出了吕宜宝在工作上的主要特点。
    吕宜宝原先是锦州中学的学生，一九五零年春天，因为家庭问题休学了。从课堂出来，他首先考虑自己的出路问题。他不愿意在乡下呆：“当庄稼人泥手泥脚的多没出息！”好赖要在城里找个工作。但是，他在锦州一连住了四、五十天也没有找到工作。他前后到锦州去了五次，每次都失望地回来了。回到家里，他觉得脸上无光，成天闷在屋里，好像作了坏事似的，不敢见人。心里想：这一生的前途就算完了吗？他的想法当然是不对的。党支部和团支部很快就知道了他的心事，十分关心他，并且向他进行了耐心的教育。党支部书记何鹏龄找他谈了好几次话，教育他安心参加农业生产。团支部吸收他和团员在一起学习。在这种情况下，他才勉强参加了生产，三天打鱼两天晒网地帮家里干点活。这样糊里糊涂地过了二年。
    一九五二年春天，村里展开了社会主义的宣传教育，号召农民走组织起来的道路。就在这一年，他家参加了互助组。在集体劳动中，他慢慢地改变了对于劳动的看法，开始爱好农业生产。在这期间，党和青年团组织始终没有放松对于他的教育，时常借书给他看，劝他积极参加生产。他感到党和团对于一个青年是多么亲切、关怀，生产劲头也大了。不久，他参加了青年团。从那时起，他就再也不想离开农业生产了。
    在这以后，他参加了县劳动模范会议和整党学习。这给他很大的教育。党和政府对于劳动模范的爱护，使他深深地感动；党委关于农村的社会主义前途的报告和辽西省农业劳动模范刘洪达的访苏报告，打动了他的心。这一次他才真正认识了劳动的光荣，懂得了轻视劳动是剥削阶级的思想。他的心里也亮了：社会主义社会就在我们眼前摆着呢！学习回来，他向党保证：坚决在党的领导下走互助合作的道路，为实现农业合作化贡献自己的一切力量。他一心要把互助组发展成为农业生产合作社。他向群众宣传了互助合作的政策，合作社的优越性，农村的社会主义前途……。他不厌其烦地向个别思想不通的农民反复进行宣传。终于，经过党委批准，他们十六户的农业生产合作社就成立起来了。他被选为合作社主任。
    合作社成立一年多了，办得有成绩。去年全社打的粮食，超过常年产量百分之三十。吕宜宝总结一年多的经验时说：“要想把合作社的生产搞好，就要做到两条：一是社里的情况要经常向区委反映，争取党委的领导；一是下决心学习，向老农学习，向实际学习。”
    吕宜宝在领导农业生产合作社的过程中，学习是勤奋的。例如，收割时候，他累得满头大汗，也跟不上一般社员，他便虚心地向社员学习，不几天跑在最前面的就是吕宜宝了。他经常学习“农业技术”等小册子，从报上学习别的地区的增产经验，并把学会的东西教给社员。他们社今年种了一部分花生，大家都不懂种花生的技术，吕宜宝就向产花生地区的干部学习，回社又教会了社员。吕宜宝有一定的文化水平，接受新事物快。他曾认真地学了肇源的增产经验。去年种包米时，社员们不信密植的好处，主张在包米中间带种豆子，说包米种得稀，打的粮食就多。吕宜宝照这办法种了一部分地，在另一部分地里实行了密植，结果，带豆子的包米地比密植地平均每亩少收三斗多。社员从此相信了密植的好处。去年社里买了半套新式马拉农具，没有充分发挥作用，有的说：“不一定好使”，表示怀疑；有的说：“咱们牲畜少，怕干不了”。吕宜宝耐心地解释了马拉农具的好处，社里现在已用新农具翻地了。
    作为一个农业生产合作社的领导者，吕宜宝在劳动中处处带头，并且注意对社员进行思想教育。去年春天打井抗旱，第一眼井打了三丈多深，需要人下去挖泉眼。当时天气还冷，人都不愿下去。他毫不犹豫地先跳下去，别的人也就随着下去了。有一天午后，下了倾盆大雨。他正在病中，忽然想起了社里的坯垛，他披上衣服，带动社员冒着大雨，把坯垛盖起来。秋收时，村北一块地的豆子，因为当时车忙不开，没拉回来。晚上，他想起豆子就不放心，和副主任何奎武一同到地里看守了几天。社员们说：主任白天干一天活，晚上还看守豆子，真拿社里的东西为重！社员们以吕宜宝为榜样，大家也都很爱护公有财产。有一天，半夜下了大雨，住在离社半里地远的郭占民，为了不使社里的农具挨浇，爬起来冒雨跑到社里，把农具遮蔽起来。由于大家关心自己的社，社里的一切都在不断进步着。吕宜宝还利用一切机会向社员进行社会主义的宣传教育。今年，社里吸收了一部分新社员，全社扩大到二十六户。备耕开始，有的新社员对增产信心不足，劳动不紧张。吕宜宝利用每天劳动后休息的时间，反复地给社员们讲解总任务，讲解社章，并用苏联农业集体化的图片，说明农村的美满前途。他还发动社员讨论增产条件，订出增产计划和劳动纪律，又建立了定期生活检讨会，展开批评和自我批评。现在，社员们的集体观念渐渐加强了，觉悟提高了，积极性也发挥了。社员吕文和刚入社时，还三心二意的，很怕白扯一年。现在他说：“合作社真好，有点啥事都是大家商量，谁道高就照谁的道做，这还有不增产的！当社员还能常参加开会讨论问题，互相帮助，觉悟也就高啦。”孙宝林刚入社时，还常讲单干的“优越性”，生产劲头不足，现在他连“单干”两字都不提了。在拉土当中，他提出一个改善劳动组织的建议，提高拉土效率百分之三十四。吕文儒过去干活不主动、很松懈，由于经常参加集体学习，也转变了。现在他跟车送粪总是带一个粪箕子，一颗粪蛋从车上掉下来，他也要拣起来扔到车上。铡豆秸时，地下抛了些豆粒，别人去吃饭、休息，他就去拣豆粒，一共给社里拣了一斗多豆子。
    今年一月十五日辽西省人民政府作出决定，奖励吕宜宝，号召全省农村的知识分子、中学和完全小学毕业生向吕宜宝学习。当这一决定和吕宜宝的事迹，在“中国青年报”“辽西日报”等报上发表后，迅速传遍全省、全国各地。北京、河南、广东、广西和东北各地的知识青年，以及解放军、志愿军的战士，纷纷给吕宜宝来信，互相鼓舞，为更好地建设祖国和保卫祖国而奋斗。青年教育工作者的来信说：我们找到了向学生进行劳动教育的活材料。许多学生来信检查了自己轻视劳动的思想，表示决心献身给农业社会主义改造事业。
    人民政府的奖励和广大青年的鼓舞，给吕宜宝增加了无限的力量。他一再表示：要进一步提高政治觉悟，虚心学习，密切联系群众，把农业生产合作社办得更好。他说：“我坚决听党的话，学习再学习，前进再前进！为实现农业的社会主义改造贡献我的一切。”
    四年以前，吕宜宝还是一个普通的初中学生；二年以前，他还是一个不安于农业劳动的知识青年；现在，他已成为一个优秀的农业合作社主任，把农业生产合作社领导得很好。我们从他身上，看到了一个农村知识青年是怎样在劳动中成长起来的。
