    Reports on the Heroic Battle of the Vietnamese People's Army to Capture Dien Bien Phu

(Xinhua News Agency, May 15th) According to Viet Nam News Agency on May 14th: A Viet Nam News Agency war correspondent reported on the general offensive launched by the Vietnamese People's Army against the French army's Dien Bien Phu, saying:

    The general offensive launched by the Vietnamese People's Army on May 6th was the most intense battle since the Vietnamese People's Army launched its offensive against the French army's Dien Bien Phu stronghold group. On the evening of the 6th, various artillery pieces of the Vietnamese People's Army continuously bombarded the central fortress of Muong Thanh from various positions. Before dawn, the Vietnamese People's Army occupied the fifth hill on the eastern defense line of Dien Bien Phu, which the enemy called the lifeline of the Dien Bien Phu French army defense system. The enemy fortification of Noong Nhai, which the enemy usually called the eye of the Dien Bien Phu fortified construction group, only 300 meters away from Brigadier General de Castries' headquarters, was also destroyed. At this time, the situation of the remaining enemy forces in Dien Bien Phu was already very critical. The enemy's only hope was to prolong the battle with the Vietnamese People's Army on the saddle-shaped highlands between the fourth and fifth hills of the eastern defense line in order to prolong their existence. Therefore, the enemy rushed the remaining elite troops to the saddle-shaped highlands. The Vietnamese People's Army fought bravely and launched many offensives against the enemy. At 9:30 am on May 7th, after annihilating all personnel of more than five companies and two battalion headquarters of the enemy, they controlled the highlands. The fate of the central fortress of Muong Thanh and the entire Dien Bien Phu French army fortified construction group was decided from that moment on.

    The Vietnamese People's Army continued to shoot. The various positions of the People's Army east of Muong Thanh were connected to each other, forming an iron ring, tightening the encirclement of Muong Thanh. Under the bombardment of enemy planes and artillery, the People's Army soldiers quickly established new positions. At the same time, the People's Army, regardless of the French army's frenzied bombing, suppressed the remaining enemy strongholds with fierce artillery fire. The enemy's many counterattacks to the southeast were unsuccessful and suffered significant losses on the banks of the Nam Yum River. By the afternoon of this day, the sound of artillery fire gradually subsided.

    At 3 p.m., the Vietnamese People's Army launched its final attack from the east and west directions of Muong Thanh. A strong force of the People's Army, descending from the saddle-shaped highlands, launched a fierce attack on the last French army defense stronghold protecting the Nam Yum River bridge. After a few minutes of battle, this stronghold was destroyed. The remaining enemy soldiers came out holding white flags to surrender to the People's Army. More than a hundred soldiers of the Foreign Legion laid down their weapons. At this time, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued an order: Quickly penetrate the enemy's heart and capture de Castries alive!

    At this decisive moment, the soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army showed amazing courage. They crossed the bridge over the Nam Yum River, crossed some remaining French army strongholds, and stormed de Castries' headquarters. A platoon led by Zuo Guolü reached the vicinity of de Castries' headquarters at 4 p.m. At the same time, troops from the southeast also crossed the Nam Yum River. A platoon led by Zhu Boshi rushed towards the artillery positions south of de Castries' headquarters. Another force from the west had already rushed through the last barbed wire fence and, after a ten-minute battle, occupied the enemy's largest artillery position, and then continued to advance rapidly. A few minutes later, these several forces met in the center of Muong Thanh.

    At this time, the French army's resistance had almost completely stopped. Wherever the golden star red flag went, the enemy's white flag appeared. Hundreds and thousands of enemy soldiers laid down their weapons, and many wounded enemy soldiers crawled out of their bunkers, relieved and shouting: The battle is over! The battle is over! The puppet soldiers threw away their hats and badges, shouting: Long live the People's Army! Long live President Ho Chi Minh! All the enemy troops in Muong Thanh collapsed like a dam that had been washed away by a flood. From the Nam Yum River to the artillery positions, from south of Muong Thanh to the location of the enemy headquarters, white flags appeared everywhere.

    At this time, five of the bravest and most agile soldiers in the platoon led by Zuo Guolü surrounded de Castries' headquarters from two directions, three in front and two in back. De Castries' shelter was a large, very strong fortification, covered with several layers of iron plates, wood, and sand. This fortification was large enough to accommodate the entire enemy headquarters personnel. At this time, a French officer threw a grenade at the People's Army soldiers, but he was immediately killed. When a French captain ran out trembling with fear to surrender, Zuo Guolü rushed into the fortification and shouted: Hands up! Then all the enemy officers inside, led by de Castries, stammered together: We...surrender. This was at 4:20 p.m. The People's Army used loudspeakers to call on the remaining enemy troops to surrender and told the prisoners of war to go to the designated location. At 5 p.m. on May 7th, the Vietnamese People's Army completely annihilated the enemy forces in Muong Thanh. A huge golden star red flag fluttered over the Muong Thanh plain. The People's Army soldiers on the battlefield shouted victorious cheers from the bottom of their hearts.

    报道越南人民军攻克奠边府的英勇战斗
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社十四日讯：越南通讯社战地记者报道越南人民军对奠边府法军发动总攻击的战况说：
    越南人民军在五月六日发动的总攻击，是自越南人民军对法军奠边府集团据点发动攻势以来最激烈的战斗。六日晚上，越南人民军的各种炮火从各个阵地不断地向中央堡垒芒清猛轰。拂晓以前，越南人民军就占领了敌人称为奠边府法军防御体系安危所系的奠边府东部防线的第五个小丘。离开德卡斯特莱准将的司令部只有三百公尺的为敌人通常称作奠边府强固工事群的眼睛的挪农敌军工事也被摧毁了。这时，尚未就歼的奠边府敌军的处境，已经非常危急了。敌人的唯一希望是想延长与越南人民军在东部防线第四个和第五个小丘之间的鞍形高地上进行的战斗，以苟延残喘。因此，敌人把残存的精锐部队赶调到鞍形高地上。越南人民军英勇作战，对敌人发动了许多次进攻。五月七日九时半，他们在歼灭了敌军五个多连与两个营部的全部人员以后，控制了高地。中央堡垒芒清以及整个奠边府法军强固工事群的命运从那个时候起就决定了。
    越南人民军继续进行射击。芒清以东人民军的各个阵地彼此相连，形成一个铁环，紧缩对芒清的包围圈。在敌人的飞机和炮火的轰击下，人民军战士敏捷地建立了新的阵地。同时，人民军不顾法军飞机的疯狂轰炸，以猛烈的炮火压制着残存的敌军据点。敌军向东南反扑多次都未得逞，并在约姆河岸受到重大的损失。到这一天的下午，炮声渐渐稀少了。
    下午三时，越南人民军从芒清东、西两个方向发动了最后一次的攻击。自鞍形高地下来的强大的人民军部队向掩护着约姆河大桥的法军最后防御据点猛攻。经过几分钟的战斗，就摧毁了这个据点。残余敌军举着白旗出来向人民军投降。一百多个外籍军团的士兵放下了武器。这时，越南人民军总司令部下了命令：迅速插入敌军心脏，活捉德卡斯特莱！
    在这个决定性的时刻，越南人民军战士表现了惊人的勇敢。他们跨过约姆河上的桥梁，越过残存的一些法军据点，直捣德卡斯特莱的司令部。左国律率领的一个排在下午四时攻到德卡斯特莱的司令部附近。同时从东南来的部队也渡过了约姆河。由朱波世率领的一个排冲向德卡斯特莱的司令部以南的炮兵阵地。从西面来的另外一支部队已经冲过了最后的一道铁丝网，经过十分钟战斗后，占领了敌军最大的炮兵阵地，随后继续迅速推进。几分钟以后，上述这几支部队在芒清的中心会师了。
    这时候，法军的抵抗几乎完全停止了。金星红旗每到一处，敌人的白旗也就在那一处出现。成百上千的敌军纷纷放下武器，许多受伤的敌军从他们的掩体爬出来，如释重负地高喊着：战斗结束了！战斗结束了！伪军士兵们抛掷着他们的帽子和徽章，喊道：人民军万岁！胡志明主席万岁！芒清所有的敌军部队都像被洪水冲垮了的堤坝一样崩溃了。从约姆河到炮兵阵地，从芒清以南到敌军司令部所在地，到处都出现了白旗。
    这时，由左国律率领的一排人中的五名最勇敢和最敏捷的战士分两头包围了德卡斯特莱的司令部，三个在前面，两个在后面。德卡斯特莱的掩蔽所是一座很大的、非常坚固的工事，上面盖着好几层铁板、木头和沙土。这个工事大得足够容纳敌军的整个司令部人员。这时，一个法国军官向人民军战士投掷了一枚手榴弹，但是他立刻就被击毙了。当一个法军上尉害怕得浑身发抖跑出来投降的时候，左国律冲进工事里喝令：举起手来！于是里面的全部敌军军官由德卡斯特莱带头一齐嗫嗫地说：我们……投降。这时正是四点二十分。人民军用扩音器喊话，要残余的敌军投降，并且告诉战俘们到指定的地点去。五月七日下午五时，越南人民军全部歼灭了芒清的敌军。芒清平原上飘扬起一面巨大的金星红旗。战场上的人民军战士从心底里发出了胜利的欢呼声。
