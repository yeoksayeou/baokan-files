Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 28th: The Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution on the 27th, requesting the swift fulfillment of the promise to invite representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan. The resolution urges the Yoshida government to agree to invite representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan.

The invitation for representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan was initially extended by Mr. Tadatsugu Shimazu, the head of the Japanese delegation to China (comprising the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association) to discuss the return of Japanese nationals, and the president of the Japanese Red Cross Society, at the beginning of last year. This invitation was to express gratitude for the Chinese Red Cross's sincere assistance in helping Japanese nationals in China return to their country.

The Japanese people warmly welcome the visit of the Chinese Red Cross representatives to Japan. At many gatherings of Japanese people's organizations, resolutions have been repeatedly passed, demanding the fulfillment of the invitation to the Chinese Red Cross representatives. However, the Yoshida government has been obstructing this, causing the invitation to remain unfulfilled to this day.

    日本众议院一致通过决议
    邀中国红十字会代表访日
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本国会众议院在二十七日一致通过了一项决议，要求迅速实现邀请中国红十字会的代表访问日本的诺言。决议敦促吉田政府同意邀请中国红十字会代表到日本访问。
    关于中国红十字会代表访问日本的邀请，是去年年初由日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三团体组成的来华商洽协助日侨回国的日方代表团团长、日本红十字会会长岛津忠承发出的。这一邀请是为了表示对中国红十字会热诚协助在华日侨回国的谢意。
    日本人民都热烈欢迎中国红十字会代表访问日本。在日本人民团体的许多次集会上，曾不断通过决议，要求实现对中国红十字会代表的邀请。但是吉田政府一直进行阻挠，致使这一邀请至今未能实现。
