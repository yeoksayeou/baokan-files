Yushu in Jilin Province, Changtu in Liaoxi Province and other counties' rural areas are actively preparing pig feed. Gongnong Village in Yushu County is using riverside areas, field edges, ditch sides, and potato fields to plant more than nine hectares of gourds, angled gourds, and barnyard grass, which can basically solve the feed problem for 350 pigs in the whole village. In addition to planning to ensile some feed, Daxing Village in Changtu County is also making full use of vacant land to grow gourds and angled gourds as much as possible to solve the feed problem for 513 fattening pigs in the whole village.

    榆树昌图等县准备养猪饲料
    吉林省的榆树、辽西省的昌图等县部分乡村，正积极准备猪的饲料。榆树工农村利用河边、地头、壕边和土豆地栽种九垧多窝瓜、角瓜、稗子等，能基本解决全村三百五十口猪的饲料问题。昌图县大兴村除计划青贮部分饲料外，并尽量利用空地多种窝瓜、角瓜，解决全村五百一十三口肥猪的饲料问题。  （东北农业局）
