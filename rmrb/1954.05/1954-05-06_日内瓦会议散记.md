Geneva Conference Jottings
By our correspondents Wang Xi, Li Fengbai, Zheng Kui

Colonialism Must Stop

Spring has been late in arriving in Geneva. The flowers and trees along Lake Leman are all in bloom. Due to the convening of the Geneva Conference, the city of Geneva has received the attention of people all over the world. Because, as Foreign Minister Molotov said, people cannot but pay attention to such an important fact: for several years, this is the first conference attended by all major powers.

The speeches made by Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai last week have been over for several days, but their impact is still expanding. These two speeches clarified a truth, that is: the reason why peace in Asia cannot be achieved is because the colonialists, especially the American imperialists, have consistently disregarded the Asian people's strong desire for national independence and democratic rights, and the fact that the Asian situation today has undergone fundamental changes, and persisted in their colonial policies that have long been hated by the Asian people. The crux of the Korean problem lies here, and the crux of the Indochina problem also lies here.

Today, the conference has entered its ninth day. The resolution of the Korean problem is still encountering obstacles. The United States' insistence on occupying South Korea, plotting to annex the entire Korean peninsula, and turning Korea into a base for aggression is the reason why the Korean problem has been unable to make progress.

What about the Indochina problem? From the day Mr. Bidault arrived in Geneva, people have been discussing that he is busy with plans for the Indochina problem. But according to some French journalists, the French government authorities are still hesitant and watching... On the one hand, this is due to the pressure from the United States to continue and expand the Indochina War, and on the other hand, it cannot ignore the universal call of the French people for a fair and reasonable peaceful resolution of the Indochina problem.

Now, the issue of the members participating in the Indochina problem discussion has been resolved. The Soviet Union and China invited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and France, Britain, and the United States invited the three federal member states including Bao Dai to participate in the conference. Many people concerned about Asian issues have said that Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speeches have pointed out the basic principles for resolving the Indochina problem, which is to respect the national interests of the Indochinese people. This is also the common interest of the Indochinese and French people. Neither old nor new colonialism will work.

"Great Diplomat"

Everyone knows that the Geneva Conference is a five-power conference with other relevant countries participating, held according to the agreement of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Peace-loving people around the world believe that this is the beginning of easing international tensions through consultations among major powers, which is a good phenomenon. Many bourgeois newspapers in Western Europe have referred to this conference as the Five-Power Conference in the past and present, which is very natural.

However, the ruling group in the United States is unwilling to admit this living fact. It prefers to hold "Three Foreign Ministers Meetings," is unwilling to hold "Four Foreign Ministers Meetings," and is even more afraid of saying "Five Foreign Ministers Meetings." They are even afraid of the number "five." For example, in a conference hall of the former League of Nations building—the venue of the conference—there is a painting on the ceiling depicting five people standing together, symbolizing the five continents. It is said that this painting caused fear among the American delegation, who were afraid that someone would interpret it as a symbol of the Five-Power Conference. Therefore, some American representatives advocated erasing it, and some advocated at least covering it with something; because some of them were concerned that doing so would be counterproductive, the painting was spared the fate of being erased or covered.

Regarding the issue of the chairman of the conference, initially many people estimated that it would be rotated among the five major powers, but the result was that the Soviet Union, Britain, and Thailand served as chairmen. The Paris newspaper "Liberation" said in a news item titled "Great Diplomat": Dulles himself did not become chairman this time because he absolutely refused to agree to "speak under the chairmanship of a Chinese Bolshevik." On April 27, Dulles had already registered to speak, but because Chairman Molotov that day hired Shi Zhe, an advisor to the Chinese delegation, as an assistant, he temporarily canceled his speech. This is speculation. But there is another saying, that is: the reason why Dulles temporarily canceled his speech was because the speech by Foreign Minister Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean delegation, was so righteous and his proposal for resolving the Korean problem was so fair and reasonable that Dulles had to consider how to quibble.

"Seeking Isolation"

The American "Christian Science Monitor" pointed out in a dispatch on the Geneva Conference on April 30: One of the differences between the Geneva Conference and the Berlin Conference "is that the Berlin Conference generally exceeded the time limit for each meeting, but the Geneva Conference averaged less than two hours for each meeting." The reason for this is naturally that the representatives of the countries participating in the so-called United Nations forces were not very enthusiastic in speaking, so that "the Americans expressed surprise at the silence of the British Foreign Secretary." Of course, everyone has their own reasons. The newspaper said that the reason why Britain is like this is because they feel that the Americans lack flexibility, creating "self-seeking isolation."

Dulles' conspiracy is clear to everyone. A few days ago, Stokes, a columnist for the Howard newspaper chain in the United States, said: "In Geneva, Washington's direct purpose is to obstruct peaceful negotiations, and then quickly establish a Pacific Atlantic Treaty and place its joint command in Singapore. The commander will be an American. He will not only command the Indochina War, but also command the British operations in Malaya."

This approach is certainly not what Britain wants. On May 1, the British "New Statesman and Nation" weekly commented on Churchill's speech on the Indochina issue, writing: "Sir Winston Churchill may also have clarified that letting us participate in such (Indochina) war would split the empire, provoke a revolt of opinion in Britain, and drive the people of Asia and Africa... into anger. Because they (the Asian people) believe that the Viet Minh's struggle is not an event of communist aggression, this is a colonial war."

Indeed, in the past two days, Western European newspapers have been discussing the internal contradictions of Western countries at great length. Not long ago, Dulles put forward the slogan of "united action" in an attempt to organize a Pacific aggressive bloc and expand the Indochina War. He originally wanted to hold two parallel conferences in Geneva, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean and Indochina issues at the formal conference, and secretly maneuvering at the so-called seventeen-nation conference to concretize the organization of the Pacific aggressive bloc. But judging from the current situation, the latter goal seems far from being achieved. Although Dulles has now left, the former plan—the United States obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem—is still stubbornly proceeding, and the Indochina problem talks have not yet formally begun.

### 日内瓦会议散记

    日内瓦会议散记
    本报记者　汪溪　李风白　郑揆
    殖民主义应该停止了
    春天迟迟地来到了日内瓦。莱蒙湖滨的花木都开放了。由于日内瓦会议的召开，日内瓦这个城市受到全世界人民的注意。因为，正像莫洛托夫外长所说的，人们不能不注意这样的重要事实，几年来，这是所有大国都参加的第一次会议。
    莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长在上周的发言已经过了好几天，但其影响却还在扩大着。这两个发言阐明了一个真理，那就是：亚洲的和平所以不能实现，就是由于殖民主义者，特别是美帝国主义者，一直无视亚洲人民要求民族独立和民主权利的强烈愿望和今天亚洲形势业已发生根本变化的事实，而坚持它们那早已被亚洲人民恨入骨髓的殖民政策。朝鲜问题的症结在这里，印度支那问题的症结也在这里。
    到今天，会议已进入第九天。朝鲜问题的解决还遭受着阻碍。美国坚持霸占南朝鲜、阴谋吞并全朝鲜并把朝鲜作为侵略基地的反动政策，就是朝鲜问题一直不能取得进展的原因。
    印度支那问题呢？从皮杜尔先生到日内瓦的第一天起，人们就在议论他正忙于印度支那问题的计划。但据一些法国记者透露，法国政府当局迄今还是犹豫、观望……这一方面是由于美国要求法国继续并扩大印度支那战争的压力，另一方面又不能忽视法国人民要求公平合理地和平解决印度支那问题的普遍呼声。
    现在，参加印度支那问题讨论的成员问题已经解决了。苏联、中国邀请越南民主共和国，法国、英国、美国邀请保大等三个联邦成员国家参加会议。很多关心亚洲问题的人都说，莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长的发言已经指出了解决印度支那问题的基本原则，这就是尊重印度支那人民的民族利益。这也是印度支那和法国人民的共同的利益。不论老的或新的殖民主义都是行不通的。
    “伟大的外交家”
    谁都知道，日内瓦会议是根据柏林四国外长会议的协议而举行的有其他有关国家参加的五大国会议。世界爱好和平的人民都认为这是经由大国协商以缓和国际紧张局势的开端，是一种好现象。西欧许多资产阶级的报纸在过去和现在都把这个会议称呼作五大国会议，这是非常自然的。
    但是，美国的统治集团却不愿承认这种活生生的事实。它喜欢开“三外长会议”，不愿意举行“四外长会议”，更怕说“五外长会议”。它们甚至害怕“五”这个数字。例如，在会议的会址——前国联大厦一个会议厅的天花板上，绘着站在一起、象征着五大洲的五个人，据说这幅画引起了美国代表团的恐惧，他们害怕有人把这幅画解释成五大国会议的象征。于是有的美国代表主张把它抹掉，有人主张至少把它用一种什么东西遮盖起来；由于他们之中有人顾忌这样更会弄巧成拙，这幅画才免于被抹掉或被遮盖的命运。
    关于大会主席的问题，最初很多人估计要由五大国轮流充任，后来的结果是由苏联、英国和泰国三国担任。巴黎“解放报”在一条题为“伟大的外交家”的消息中说：杜勒斯这次所以自己没有当主席，是因为他绝对不肯同意“在一个中国布尔什维克当主席之下来讲话”。四月二十七日，杜勒斯在先就已报名要讲话了，但因当天主席莫洛托夫聘请中国代表团顾问师哲为助手，所以他临时撤销发言。这是一种揣测。但还有另一种说法，即：杜勒斯所以临时撤销发言，是因为朝鲜代表团首席代表南日外务相的演说是那样义正词严，提出的解决朝鲜问题的方案是那样公平合理，迫使杜勒斯必须考虑如何才能进行狡辩。
      “自寻的孤立”
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”四月三十日在报道日内瓦会议的通讯中指出：日内瓦会议和柏林会议不同之处之一，“是柏林会议每次会议一般都超过时间，但日内瓦会议每次会议平均不到两个钟头。”此中原委，自然是参加所谓联合国军的各国的代表发言太不踊跃，以致“美国人对于英国外交大臣的沉默表示惊讶”。当然，各人都有各人的理由。该报说，英国所以这样，是因为他们感觉美国人缺乏灵活性，造成“自寻的孤立”。
    杜勒斯的阴谋何在，是任何人都看得很清楚的。前几天，美国霍华德系报纸的专栏作家斯托克斯就说：“在日内瓦，华盛顿的直接目的是阻挠和平的协商，然后很快地建立一个太平洋的大西洋公约，并将其联合指挥部放在新加坡。指挥将是一个美国人。他不仅将指挥印度支那战争，并将指挥英国在马来亚的战事。”
    这种作法，当然不是英国所愿意的。五月一日英国“新政治家与民族”周刊评论邱吉尔关于印度支那问题的演说写道：“邱吉尔爵士可能也阐明了让我们去参加这样（印度支那）的战争，将使帝国分裂，在英国挑起一个舆论的反抗，并将亚洲和非洲人民……赶到愤怒中去。因为他们（亚洲人民）认为，越盟的斗争并不是共产党侵略的事件，这是一个殖民战争。”
    的确，这两天来，西欧报纸正在以很大的篇幅议论西方国家内部矛盾的问题。不久以前，杜勒斯提出“联合行动”的口号，企图组织一个太平洋侵略集团，扩大印度支那战争。他本想在日内瓦召开两个平行的会议，在正式的会议上阻碍朝鲜问题和印度支那问题得到和平解决，而在所谓十七国会议上暗中活动，使太平洋侵略集团的组织具体化。但从现在的情况看来，后一个目的似乎远远没有如愿以偿。现在杜勒斯虽然走了，但前一个计划——美国阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，却仍在顽强地进行着，而印度支那问题会谈还没正式开始哩。
