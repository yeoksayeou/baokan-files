Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 15th: The Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference continued its discussion on the restoration of peace in Indochina at its May 14th meeting. V.M. Molotov presided.

The head of the Soviet delegation, V.M. Molotov, spoke on the question of restoring peace in Indochina. He reviewed the development of the situation in Indochina and recalled the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—which embarked on the road to independence and took care of the needs of the people—and he also analyzed the reasons that led to the Indochina War. Molotov attacked the aggressive plans of powerful groups in the United States to expand the war in Southeast Asia and pointed out that the proposals made by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam provided a basis for resolving the Indochina issue and could ensure the restoration of peace in Indochina. Molotov expressed his support for this proposal and put forward a supplement to facilitate agreement on the issue of supervising the implementation of the cessation of hostilities clauses. At the same time, Molotov said he believed that the Geneva Conference would consider all other proposals that could genuinely contribute to the restoration of peace in Indochina, including the French proposal that the participants guarantee the strict implementation of the agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

Pidal followed with a speech. He began by reiterating his unwillingness to talk about the political aspects of the restoration of peace in Indochina and the historical facts concerning the development of the situation in that part of the world. This statement by Pidal once again showed that any objective analysis of the essence of the Indochina issue was not to the liking of the French delegation, and therefore the French delegation avoided making such an analysis.

Nevertheless, Pidal said that the French delegation was willing to study V.M. Molotov's speech and that the French delegation had studied the speech made by Pham Van Dong, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the May 10th meeting with great attention. The French Foreign Minister assured the conference that he agreed with the basic propositions expressed by Pham Van Dong: independence, unity, and democracy. But what he said later proved that his assurances were completely empty words.

Pidal insisted on his assertion that the people's liberation movements in Cambodia and Laos were "foreign aggression," which is inconsistent with actual facts. It can also be seen from Pidal's speech that, despite the fact that this statement is inconsistent with the facts, the French delegation is using this statement to evade discussing the restoration of peace in all three countries of Indochina and to evade recognizing the national rights of their peoples in order to resolve this issue. Pidal said: The problem with Cambodia and Laos lies entirely in the withdrawal of "Viet Minh" (the Western delegations' term for the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) troops. Therefore, Pidal said that his delegation hoped to disarm the Cambodian and Laotian People's Liberation Armies and extend the anti-people regime established and supported by France to these two countries.

Pidal said that after doing this, France would be prepared to withdraw its troops from these countries if their governments (Pidal was referring to the puppet governments of Laos and Cambodia) so requested.

Referring to Pham Van Dong's proposal, Pidal insisted that only the Bao Dai government—which France recognized as having "sovereignty and independence" over the entire territory of Vietnam—had the right to speak for Vietnam. Pidal's remarks show that he is stubbornly unwilling to consider the indisputable fact that three-quarters of the territory of Vietnam is under the control of the Democratic Government of Vietnam, which represents the will of all the Vietnamese people.

When Pidal spoke about the second point of the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, namely the provision for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of Vietnam, he said: "The French government is not prepared to make the restoration of peace in Indochina dependent on any guarantee" on the question of the withdrawal of French troops from the territory of Vietnam.

At the same time, Pidal rejected the proposal for free and universal elections in Vietnam under the supervision of local committees. He revealed that powerful groups in France were afraid of the Vietnamese people expressing their free will, and he said that the French delegation only agreed to elections under international supervision.

Pidal advocated that only military issues should be resolved now, and not political issues.

Pidal opposed the simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina, implying that in his view it would be preferable to adopt a gradual ceasefire approach. As for the issue of guaranteeing and supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, Pidal reiterated his proposal that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should guarantee the implementation of these agreements.

Finally, Pidal responded to the questions raised by Eden at the May 12th meeting. In his response, Pidal said that the local committees for supervising elections as stipulated in the proposal of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam could be established under certain conditions; however, Pidal said that these local committees should be subordinate to the "international committee."

The last speaker at the meeting was the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, who repeated the absurd claim of the Cambodian puppet regime that it had the right to represent the Cambodian people.

Chairman Molotov, in announcing the adjournment, said that according to the agreement of the participating countries, no meeting would be held tomorrow. A restricted meeting will be held on Monday, May 17.

    日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社日内瓦十五日讯：日内瓦外长会议五月十四日会议上继续讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。由维·米·莫洛托夫担任主席。
    苏联代表团首席代表维·米·莫洛托夫就恢复印度支那和平的问题发言。他追述了印度支那事态的发展，并追述了越南民主共和国——它走上了独立的道路并照顾了人民的需要——的成立，他还分析了促成印度支那战争的原因。莫洛托夫抨击美国的有势力的集团企图扩大东南亚战争的侵略计划，并指出越南民主共和国代表团提出的建议提供了解决印度支那问题的基础，并且能够保证印度支那和平的恢复。莫洛托夫表示他支持这个建议，并提出一项补充，以促使在监督停止敌对行动条款的执行问题上达成协议。同时，莫洛托夫表示他相信日内瓦会议将考虑所有其他能够真正有助于恢复印度支那和平的建议，包括法国提出的关于与会者保证严格执行停止印度支那敌对行动的协议的建议。
    接着发言的是皮杜尔。他一开始就重申他不愿意谈论恢复印度支那和平问题的政治方面以及有关世界那一部分的事态发展的历史事实。皮杜尔的这种说法再一次表明：对于印度支那问题本质的任何客观分析都不是法国代表团所喜欢的，因此法国代表团避免作这样的分析。
    尽管如此，皮杜尔说法国代表团愿意研究维·米·莫洛托夫的发言，又说法国代表团已经极为注意地研究了越南民主共和国代表范文同在五月十日会议上的发言。法国外交部长向会议保证说，他同意范文同表示的基本主张：独立、统一和民主。但是他后来所说的话证明他的保证完全是装装样子的空话。
    皮杜尔坚持他的说法，就是高棉和寮国的人民解放运动是“外国侵略”，而这是与实际事实不符的。从皮杜尔的发言还可以看出：尽管这种说法与事实不符，法国代表团还是利用这种说法来规避讨论恢复印度支那所有三个国家的和平问题、规避承认它们的人民的民族权利以解决这个问题。皮杜尔说：高棉与寮国的问题完全在于撤退“越盟”（西方国家代表团对越南民主共和国代表团的称呼）军队。因此，皮杜尔说他的代表团希望解除高棉和寮国人民解放军的武装，并把法国建立并支持的反人民政权扩展到这两个国家去。
    皮杜尔说：做到这一点以后，法国将准备从这些国家撤出它的军队，假如它们的政府（皮杜尔是指寮国与高棉的傀儡政府）这样要求的话。
    谈到范文同的建议时，皮杜尔硬说只有保大政府——法国承认它在整个越南领土上的“主权与独立”——有权利代表越南说话。皮杜尔的这种言论表明，他顽固地不愿意考虑这个不可争辩的事实，就是越南领土的四分之三在越南民主政府的控制之下，这个政府代表所有越南人民的意志。
    皮杜尔谈到越南民主共和国建议的第二点，即自越南领土上撤退一切外国军队的规定时说：“法国政府不准备使印度支那和平的恢复取决于它”在法国军队从越南领土撤退问题上“的任何保证”。
    皮杜尔同时拒绝了关于在地方性的委员会的监督下在越南进行自由普选的建议。他透露，法国有势力的集团害怕越南人民表达自由意志，他说，法国代表团只同意在国际监督下进行选举。
    皮杜尔主张现在只解决军事问题，而不解决政治问题。
    皮杜尔反对在印度支那全境同时停止敌对行动，他暗示，以他的看法是宁可采取逐步停火的办法。至于保证监督履行停战协定的问题，皮杜尔重申他的建议说，参加日内瓦会议的国家要保证这些协定的履行。
    皮杜尔最后对艾登在五月十二日会议上所提出的问题作了答复。皮杜尔在答复中说，越南民主共和国代表团提出的建议中所规定的监督选举的地方性的委员会可在一定的条件下建立，然而，皮杜尔说，这些地方性的委员会应该从属于“国际委员会”。
    在会上最后发言的是高棉王国的代表，他重复提出高棉傀儡政权的荒谬主张，说它有权代表高棉人民。
    主席莫洛托夫在宣布休会时说，根据参加会议的国家的协议，明天不举行会议。在星期一，即五月十七日举行限制性会议。
