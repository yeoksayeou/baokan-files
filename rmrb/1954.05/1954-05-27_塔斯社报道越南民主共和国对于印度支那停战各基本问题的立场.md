　　TASS Reports on the Position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Basic Issues of the Indochina Armistice
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 26th] TASS Geneva, May 25th: In the course of the Geneva Conference's discussions on the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stated its position on several basic issues included in the draft proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 10th and the French delegation on May 8th. As previously reported, according to the agreement reached on May 21st at the initiative of the Soviet delegation, the issues to be discussed with priority include: simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina, determination of concentration areas for the forces of the warring parties, cessation of the introduction of new troops and weapons into Indochina, supervision of the implementation of the armistice terms by a neutral nations commission and a mixed commission composed of representatives of the warring parties, and provision of guarantees by the participants of the Geneva Conference.
　　It is known that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also expressed its views on the issue of armed forces that do not belong to the regular army or the "forces maintaining order" raised by the French delegation, as well as on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, which was mentioned in both the draft proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes, as indicated in its statement, that a thorough and simultaneous ceasefire must be achieved as soon as possible throughout Indochina. The delegation stated that a thorough ceasefire means a ceasefire that is observed by all ground, naval, and air forces, all regular and irregular forces of both belligerent parties. A simultaneous ceasefire means that the ceasefire should be implemented simultaneously in all places where military activities are taking place.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that if the ceasefire is not thorough, for example, if it is not observed by certain armed forces, or if it is not observed by certain forces of some regularity controlled by well-known and dangerous feudal forces, then it will cause military actions that may produce dangerous developments.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam starts from the assumption that if the ceasefire is not simultaneous, but a gradual ceasefire from one country to another, from one military operation area to another military operation area, it will cause military action to concentrate in some areas, and then these areas will become war zones, from which the war can spread and become a universal war.
　　The ceasefire must be realized as soon as possible because the people of Indochina, as the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam emphasized, are eager for peace and hope that the Geneva Conference will reach an agreement on the most urgent and pressing issues before it.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that after the principles of a thorough and simultaneous ceasefire have been adopted and agreed upon as soon as possible, the ceasefire must be made effective and guaranteed. For this, the most important issue must be resolved, which is the withdrawal of the regular forces of the warring parties to designated areas in accordance with orders, the main principles of which must be decided by the conference. After the main principles of withdrawal have been decided, in view of the complex nature of the military operation areas, a specific and practical on-site study of this issue must be carried out within each country.
　　This is the attitude of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards the issue of regular forces. As for irregular forces, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the issue of disarming them, which was raised at the conference, does not actually exist, because after the principle of cessation of hostilities has been adopted and agreed upon, this issue has nothing in common with the cessation of hostilities; all belligerent parties must abide by the agreement and take all necessary measures in the areas where they exercise power and bear responsibility to ensure the cessation of hostilities and prevent the recurrence of war.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam considers that the second issue that is fundamental to guaranteeing and consolidating the ceasefire is the complete cessation of the introduction of new troops—ground, naval, and air forces—as well as all kinds of weapons, ammunition, and equipment into Indochina. This issue of principle needs careful consideration; if the cessation of military action is seen as a step towards restoring peace, rather than a truce, not a breathing space that can be used to replenish armed forces from the outside in preparation for new hostilities, then this issue does not seem complicated.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has emphasized that the issue of withdrawing the regular forces of the warring parties to designated areas and the issue of ceasing the introduction of new troops, weapons, and equipment into Indochina are two of the most important issues closely related to the ceasefire.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that the principle of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement has been unanimously accepted, and said that such supervision is mainly to supervise the faithful implementation of the decisions taken on the above two issues. The proposals of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam first stipulate that supervision is to be carried out by a mixed supervisory commission composed of representatives of the warring parties. In view of the general military operation areas of Indochina and the complexity of the military operation areas of each country, especially Vietnam, it is necessary to form such a mixed supervisory commission. It is necessary to have people who are familiar with the situation to understand the situation and supervise the correct implementation of the agreement.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that this supervision should be supplemented by international supervision carried out by a supervisory commission composed of representatives of neutral countries. If this principle is accepted, then the task now is to decide on the members and powers of the mixed supervisory commission and the international commission, as well as the relationship between the two.
　　Regarding the issue of international guarantees, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has reiterated that it agrees that such guarantees should be provided by the countries participating in the conference, and pointed out that such guarantees must be strictly multilateral and collective.
　　Regarding the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that everyone agrees to this exchange, and this issue will not cause any particular difficulties.
　　In introducing its proposals, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that the proposals were put forward based on the most sincere desire to reach a reasonable agreement on a ceasefire in Indochina. The delegation believes that in order to reach such an agreement, the conference should limit itself to discussing some basic issues whose general principles can be discussed and accepted by everyone. With the general principles thus obtained as a basis, it will then be possible to discuss the issue of a ceasefire in each country separately. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it is possible to start with Vietnam, the most important military operation area where the situation is much more complicated than elsewhere. As for Cambodia and Laos, an acceptable procedure should continue to be sought.
　　The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that if this procedure proves to be acceptable to the conference, then it will enable the conference not only to get out of a very difficult situation, but also to find some practical solutions, paving the way for a general agreement.

    塔斯社报道越南民主共和国对于印度支那停战各基本问题的立场
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社日内瓦二十五日讯：在日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论过程中，越南民主共和国已就越南民主共和国代表团五月十日提出的建议草案和法国代表团五月八日提出的建议草案中包括的若干基本问题，表明了它的立场。前已报道，按照五月二十一日在苏联代表团的倡议下达成的协议，将予优先讨论的问题包括：印度支那全境同时停火问题、确定交战双方部队的集中地区问题、停止把新的军队和武器运入印度支那问题、中立国委员会和由交战双方代表组成的混合委员会监督停战条款的执行问题、日内瓦会议的参加者提供保证问题。
    大家知道，越南民主共和国代表团对于法国代表团提出的关于既不属于正规军又不属于“维持治安的部队”的武装力量的问题以及越南民主共和国和法国的建议草案中都提到的交换战俘问题也表明了它的看法。
    越南民主共和国代表团认为，正如它的声明中所指出的，彻底的、同时的停火必须尽早、尽可能在印度支那全境实现。代表团表明，彻底的停火意味着是交战双方所有的地面部队、海军和空军部队、所有的正规军和非正规军一律遵守的停火。同时停火意味着，停火应该在一切有军事活动进行的地方同时实现。
    越南民主共和国代表团认为，停火如果不彻底，譬如说，如果没有为某些武装部队所履行，如果没有为受到人所共知的、危险的封建势力控制的某些有一点正规性的部队所遵守，那么就会引起可能产生危险的发展的军事行动。
    越南民主共和国代表团是从这样的假定出发的：假如停火不是同时的，而是从一个国家到另一个国家，从一个军事行动地区到另一个军事行动地区的逐步停火的话，就会使得军事行动集中在某些地区，然后这些地区就会成为战争地区，从这里战争就能够蔓延开来，以致成为普遍性的战争。
    停火必须尽可能早实现，因为印度支那人民，如越南民主共和国代表团所着重指出的，渴望和平并希望日内瓦会议就它面前最迫切、最紧急的问题达成协议。
    越南民主共和国代表团认为：在尽早通过了彻底的、同时的停火的原则以后，必须使得停火有效并得到保障。为此必须解决最重要的问题，这就是：交战双方的正规部队按照命令——其主要原则必须由会议来决定——撤退到指定地区的问题。在撤退的主要原则决定以后，鉴于军事行动地区的错综复杂的性质，必须在每个国家范围内，对这个问题作具体的、实际的现场研究。
    这就是越南民主共和国代表团对于正规军问题的态度。至于非正规军，越南民主共和国代表团认为，在会议上提出来的解除他们的武装的问题实际上并不存在，因为在停止敌对行动的原则获得通过并达成协议以后，这个问题与停止敌对行动就没有丝毫共同之处；所有交战方面必须遵守协定，并在他们行使权力与负有责任的地区采取一切必要的措施来保证敌对行动的停止并防止战火再起。
    越南民主共和国代表团认为是基本的、以保证并巩固停火的第二个问题就是：完全停止以新的部队——地面部队、海军与空军部队——以及各种武器、弹药与装备运入印度支那。这个原则性的问题需要周密的考虑；假如把停止军事行动看作是恢复和平的一个步骤，而不是休战，不是一个可以用来从外面补充武装部队以准备新的敌对行动的喘息机会的话，这个问题似乎并不是复杂的。
    越南民主共和国代表团已强调指出：把交战双方的正规军撤退到指定地区的问题和停止把新的军队、武器与装备运到印度支那的问题是和停火密切相关的两个最重要的问题。
    越南民主共和国代表团指出，监督停战协定的执行的原则已被一致接受，并说，这种监督主要是监督就上述两个问题采取的决定的忠实的执行。越南民主共和国代表团的建议首先规定由交战双方代表所组成的混合监督委员会来进行监督。有鉴于印度支那一般的军事行动地区以及每一个国家，特别是越南的军事行动地区的复杂性，组成这种混合监督委员会是必要的。必须有熟悉情况的人来了解情况，并监督协定的正确执行。
    越南民主共和国代表团认为，这种监督应该辅以由中立国代表组成的监督委员会所实行的国际监督。如果这种原则被接受的话，那么现在的工作就是决定混合监督委员会和国际委员会的成员与职权问题，以及二者之间的关系问题。
    关于国际保证问题，大家知道越南民主共和国代表团已经重申它同意由参加会议的国家来提供这种保证，并指出这种保证必须具有严格的多边性与集体性。
    关于交换战俘问题，越南民主共和国代表团指出，大家都同意这种交换，这个问题不会产生特别的困难。
    越南民主共和国代表团在介绍它的建议时指出，提出这个建议是基于想就印度支那停火达成合理协议的最热诚的愿望。代表团认为：为了达成这样的协议，会议应该限于讨论一些其总原则能为大家讨论与接受的基本问题。以这样得出的总原则作为基础，随后就有可能讨论到分别在每一个国家停火的问题。越南民主共和国代表团认为，先从形势比别的地方要复杂得多的最重要的军事行动地区越南开始是可能的。至于高棉与寮国，应该继续寻求一个大家都能接受的程序。
    越南民主共和国代表团相信，假如这个程序证明是能为会议接受的话，那么它将使会议不仅能够脱离一个十分困难的处境，而且还能找到某种实际解决办法，为总的协议铺平道路。
