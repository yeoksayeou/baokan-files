    Most of East China Completes Wheat Pre-Purchase Work
    The wheat pre-purchase work in the East China region has been completed in most areas. In Fujian Province, Anhui Province, and the southern part of Zhejiang Province, the wheat pre-purchase work has basically concluded. In Jiangsu, Shandong, and the northern part of Zhejiang, some areas have also completed the pre-purchase work.
    The wheat pre-purchase work has strongly supported spring plowing and production. After farmers in thirteen townships including Tantou and Xianqi in Changle County, Fujian Province, received more than 180 million yuan in pre-purchase deposits, they promptly purchased more than 360 various farm tools, over 15,000 jin of seeds such as soybeans and peanuts, and over 168,000 jin of fertilizers such as fertilizer powder. Shang Bingfu and Zhang Xuetang, two mutual aid teams in Gaozhao Township, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, were worried about lacking cash for production materials such as waterwheels and fertilizers. After pre-selling wheat and receiving deposits, these items have now been fully equipped. Many farmers in De County, Shandong, praised the state's measures for pre-purchasing wheat, saying: "The pre-purchase work has come at the right time. We were just like climbing a cliff, and the government came to give us a hand!" (Cheng Hua)

    华东大部地区
    完成小麦预购工作
    华东区小麦预购工作，大部地区已经完成。福建省、安徽省及浙江省南部地区，小麦预购工作已经基本结束；江苏、山东及浙江北部，也有部分地区完成了预购工作。
    小麦预购工作，有力地支持了春耕生产。福建省长乐县潭头、仙歧等十三个乡的农民得到一亿八千多万元的预购定金以后，及时购买了各种农具三百六十多件，黄豆、花生等种籽一万五千余斤，以及肥田粉等肥料十六万八千多斤。浙江省嘉兴县高照乡尚炳甫、张雪堂两个互助组缺少水车、肥料等生产资料，正愁没有现款，预售小麦，领到定金以后，这些东西都已置备齐全。山东德县等地许多农民称赞国家预购小麦的措施说：“预购工作正是时候。咱们正像上山崖，政府来给拉了一把！”   （程华）
