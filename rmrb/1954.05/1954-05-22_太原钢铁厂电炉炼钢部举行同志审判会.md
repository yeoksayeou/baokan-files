Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department Holds Comrades' Tribunal
The state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department held its first comrades' tribunal. After education, the comrades under trial resolved to correct their mistakes and improve their work.

Since its establishment on April 2nd, the Comrades' Tribunal of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department of the plant, after repeated study by all members of the Tribunal and with the approval of the director of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department, decided to hold its first trial on April 16th, judging Chen Xingjun, who had consistently been passive and engaged in deliberate slowdowns; Gao Youqing, who violated operating procedures and caused a minor accident; Yang Jindong, who created disunity and damaged public property; and Yang Baolin, who engaged in petty theft. More than 300 employees attended this comrades' tribunal. In addition, leaders from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Party Committee, administration, and trade union, as well as representatives from the provincial and municipal People's Courts and other units, were also present to provide guidance.

The tribunal proceeded from beginning to end in a serious and sincere atmosphere. During the trial, worker Wei Jiyao criticized Chen Xingjun's mistakes, pointing out: "I am quite familiar with you. You have consistently been irresponsible in your work, passive and deliberately slowing down, sleeping on the job, and frequently absent. You adopt such an attitude towards production because you still lack the consciousness of being the master of the country, which damages production. This is an attitude that the working class should not have. The mistakes you have committed are also intolerable." Due to the serious and conscientious criticism made by the masses of employees at the tribunal, Chen Xingjun, Yang Jindong, Gao Youqing, Yang Baolin and the four others were greatly inspired and educated, and unanimously stated: From now on, they will resolutely correct their mistakes, constantly improve their class consciousness, and ensure that they do a good job in production.

The comrades' tribunal not only corrected the erroneous thinking of the comrades under trial but also educated the factory's employees. After the meeting, in group discussions, the employees of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department generally believed that the comrades' tribunal had a great enlightening and educational effect on everyone and was an indispensable mass self-education organization in production enterprises. In addition to conducting self-criticism at the meeting, some employees of the department also made assurances: to strengthen unity, obey leadership, abide by labor discipline, and strive to complete and overfulfill the production tasks assigned by the state.

    太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部举行同志审判会
    国营太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部举行首次同志审判会，受审同志经过教育后，决心纠正错误，改进工作。
    该厂电炉炼钢部同志审判会自四月二日成立后，经同志审判会全体委员反复研究，并经过电炉炼钢部主任批准，确定在四月十六日，首次审判犯有一贯消极怠工的陈兴俊、违反操作规程因而造成轻微责任事故的高有庆、闹不团结并损坏公物的杨金洞、有轻微盗窃行为的杨保林等四人。出席这次同志审判会的职工有三百多人。此外，太原钢铁厂党委、行政和工会的领导同志和省、市人民法院等单位代表也列席指导。
    审判会自始至终是在严肃的、诚恳的气氛中进行的。在审判中，工人魏继尧批判陈兴俊的错误时指出：“我和你比较熟识。你对工作一贯不负责任，消极怠工，上班睡觉，时常旷工。你抱着这样的态度对待生产，就是因为你还缺乏国家主人翁的自觉，致使生产受到损害，这是工人阶级不应有的态度。你所犯的错误也是使人不能容忍的。”由于职工群众在审判会上进行了严肃认真的批评，使陈兴俊、杨金洞、高有庆、杨保林等四人受到很大的启发和教育，一致表示：从今以后坚决改正错误，不断地提高阶级觉悟，保证搞好生产。
    同志审判会，不但纠正了受审同志的错误思想，而且也教育了该厂职工群众。会后，电炉炼钢部职工在小组讨论中，普遍认为同志审判会对大家的启发、教育作用很大，是生产企业中不可缺少的群众性的自我教育组织。该部部分职工除在会上进行了自我检查之外，并纷纷提出保证：加强团结，服从领导，遵守劳动纪律，为完成和超额完成国家给予的生产任务而努力。
