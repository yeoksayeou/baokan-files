Farmers in the agricultural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are tensely carrying out spring ploughing and sowing. Currently, with the exception of the colder Houshan area and the Chahar League, which are still sowing wheat, the Zhaowuda League, the Hetao Administrative Region, and other places have completed wheat sowing and are now sowing field crops. In the Zhaowuda League, the early-sown wheat has mostly sprouted.

This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has newly established 987 agricultural production cooperatives. In the eastern region, about 80% of the farmers are organized. They are driving the vast number of farmers to sow early in spring production. Farmers in various places generally pay attention to technical reforms such as seed selection, seed mixing, rational close planting, and moisture conservation and drought prevention. In Anbei County, Hetao Administrative Region, farmers have modified old seed drills into close-planting drills in order to implement close planting. According to statistics from eight townships, 328 old drills have been modified this year, and 43 new close-planting drills have been purchased, accounting for 70% of all drills. As a result, close planting has been implemented on 73% of the wheat cultivation area. In the Pingtiquan Administrative Region, more than 210,000 mu of wheat fields in four banners and counties have been spring-irrigated. In the Liaohe River basin area of the Jerim League, 900,000 mu of land has been accumulated this spring, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year. At the same time, the wheat sowing area has also been appropriately expanded in various places. (Tang Yongzhong)

    内蒙古自治区各农业区农民紧张进行春耕
    内蒙古自治区农业区农民紧张进行春耕播种。目前，除气候较寒冷的后山地区和察哈尔盟正在播种小麦外，昭乌达盟、河套行政区等地小麦已播种完毕，现正进行播种大田作物，昭乌达盟早播的小麦，大部已经发芽。
    内蒙古自治区今年新建了九百八十七个农业生产合作社，东部区组织起来的农民占百分之八十左右，它们在春耕生产中，带动广大农民提早下种。各地农民一般都注意选种、拌种、合理密植、保墒防旱等技术改革工作。河套行政区安北县的农民为了实行密植，把旧耧改成密植耧，据八个乡的统计今年改旧耧三百二十八张，新购密植耧四十三张，占全部耧数百分之七十，因而在百分之七十三的小麦耕作面积上实行了密植。平地泉行政区四个旗、县有二十一万多亩麦田进行了春浇，哲里木盟辽河流域地区今春完成汇地九十万亩，比去年增加百分之四十以上。同时各地也适当地扩大了小麦播种面积。　（唐永忠）
