    The Hanchuan Water Conservancy and Irrigation Station in Songjiang Province is actively preparing to make full use of existing equipment to expand the irrigation area in order to help farmers develop production. This year's water supply plan for the irrigation station has increased from irrigating 2,100 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of land last year to 2,900 hectares, which is expected to increase farmers' rice production by more than 7 million catties. This is a corner of the Hanchuan Water Conservancy and Irrigation Station.
