Shanxi Trains Agricultural Meteorology Observers

The agricultural meteorology observer training class, run by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture, has recently concluded, and sixteen new county-level weather stations will be established throughout the province. To understand weather changes and provide timely guidance for agricultural production, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government started a meteorological personnel training class in late March. Trainees included eighty-three young in-service cadres with secondary or higher education transferred from various farms. The trainees learned about the significance of meteorological observation work and diligently studied professional techniques. Within a month, they all learned the scientific principles of observing wind, rain, cloudiness, and sunshine, and initially mastered the techniques of using observation instruments. After graduation, the trained personnel will go to sixteen counties such as Hunyuan and Wanquan to begin preparing for the establishment of key meteorological stations. Each station is now equipped with cadres and necessary instruments, and a contact reporting system for each station has been established. It is expected that meteorological records can begin in early June. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西训练农业气象观测人员
    山西省人民政府农业厅开办的农业气象观测人员训练班最近已经结束，全省将要新建十六个县的气象站。为掌握天气变化适时指导农业生产，山西省人民政府在三月下旬开办了气象人员训练班。受训的有各级农场调来的具有中等以上文化程度的在职青年干部计八十三人。学员们学习中了解到气象观测工作的意义，苦学钻研业务技术。一月内都学会观测风雨阴晴的科学道理和初步掌握使用观测仪器的技术。受训学员结业后便分赴浑源、万泉等十六个县开始筹建气象重点站。现在各站已配备了干部和必要的仪器，订出各站联系报告制度，预计六月初可开始气象纪录。　　（新华社）
