Shaanxi Province Universally Launches Pest Control Work

During the wheat flowering and pollination period, the Party and government leading organs of Shaanxi Province actively led the masses in preventing and controlling insect pests to strive for a bumper harvest. The provincial headquarters for the prevention and control of wheat midges has been established. In early May, Zhao Shoushan, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, and Han Zhao'e, Vice Chairman, led four working groups to Weinan and Baoji Prefectures, as well as Chang'an, Hu County, and Xianyang counties, to inspect and urge the prevention and control of wheat midges. Weinan Prefecture made earlier arrangements for the prevention and control of wheat midges. Around mid-April, eleven counties, including Lantian, Hua County, Huayin, and Jingyang, prepared more than 600,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder and more than 340 sprayers before the pests emerged from the soil. These were distributed to supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties for supply to farmers. The 126 agricultural technology guidance stations distributed throughout the province studied and determined pest control plans and specific methods in mid-February, based on the different regions and crop conditions.

Farmers in areas where insect pests were discovered launched pest control work under the leadership and coordination of Party and government organs at all levels and agricultural technology stations. In many areas, insect pests in wheat fields have been largely eradicated. In the fifth district of Weinan County, Weinan Prefecture, in addition to using "666" pesticide powder to eliminate insect pests in 2,075 mu of wheat fields, grass ash sprinkling and other methods were used to control relatively mild infestations in 12,641 mu. At present, red spider mites in the entire district's wheat fields have been completely eliminated. Farmers in Hancheng County have actively controlled insect pests in more than 8,000 mu of wheat fields where wheat midges have occurred. In areas with severe wheat midge infestations, they sprayed more than 6,600 jin of "666" pesticide powder in 2,500 mu, and used net dragging for pest control in areas with lighter infestations, with good results. Currently, the masses are combining weeding with pest control. (Ma Chaoqing)

    陕西省各地普遍展开防治虫害工作
    陕西省党、政领导机关，在小麦扬花受粉期间，积极领导群众防治虫害，争取丰收。省的防治吸浆虫指挥部已成立。五月上旬省人民政府赵寿山主席、韩兆鹗副主席带领四个工作组，分赴渭南、宝鸡两专区和长安、鄠县、咸阳三个县检查和督促防治小麦吸浆虫工作。渭南专区各地对吸浆虫防治工作的布置较早，在四月中旬左右，蓝田、华县、华阴、泾阳等十一县，在害虫出土前，已准备好了六十万多斤“六六六”药粉和三百四十多架喷粉器，分运各县供销合作社，供应农民。分布在全省各地的一百二十六个农业技术指导站，在二月中旬即根据不同地区、不同作物情况，研究确定防治虫害计划和具体办法。
    各地发现虫害地区的农民，在各级党、政机关及农业技术站领导和配合下，展开了防虫工作，不少地区麦田虫害已大部扑灭。渭南专区渭南县五区用“六六六”药粉扑灭了二千零七十五亩麦田虫害外，并用草灰撒治等方法防治了较轻的一万二千六百四十一亩，目前全区麦田红蜘蛛已全部扑灭。韩城县农民已在发生吸浆虫的八千多亩麦田中，积极防治虫害，并在二千五百亩吸浆虫严重的地区喷撒“六六六”药粉六千六百多斤，在虫害较轻地区用拉网防虫，效果很好。目前群众正在结合锄草进行防治。（马超卿）
