Moscow on the Eve of "May Day" International Labor Day

On the eve of "May Day," Moscow is already displaying a scene of festive joy.

The festive decorations on Red Square and various squares, streets, and buildings have been completed. The route markers for the festive parade have been marked out on Red Square. The towering building of the Moscow State Department Store, opposite the Kremlin, is decorated with huge emblems of the Soviet Union and the sixteen union republics. Huge banners with gold lettering on a red background, bearing the slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union celebrating the holiday, cover the entire building. The Historical Museum on the left side of Red Square, the Lenin Central Museum not far away, Moscow University, and the Bolshoi Theatre are all shimmering with brilliant flags and slogans. The central telegraph office building on Gorky Street is decorated with portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet national emblem, surrounded by beautiful patterns. On both sides are the flags of the Soviet Union and the sixteen union republics. At night, tens of thousands of colorful electric lights illuminate the huge slogans and the words "Long Live the Fraternal Friendship of All Nationalities of Our Country!" on the lintels. Red flags are flying everywhere, and the large golden letters "May 1" composed of Russian letters are shining in the spring sunshine.

In recent days, various activities celebrating "May Day" have already begun one after another. At celebration rallies in various districts, the working people enthusiastically expressed their support for the resolutions of the First Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. At celebration rallies in various factories, workers who have achieved outstanding results in the competition were commended. Moscow factories, which initiated a labor competition to further increase labor productivity to welcome "May Day," have already fulfilled their competition pledges. The Petrel Shoe Factory, the Mikoyan Food Factory, and the Bolshevik Confectionery Factory, and other enterprises producing consumer goods, have all completed their tasks ahead of schedule. These factories are preparing to produce products worth more than 100 million rubles before "May Day."

Moscow stores are crowded with people buying holiday gifts and spring and summer clothing fabrics. At the telegraph offices, people are sending congratulatory telegrams to relatives and friends for the holiday. On Red Square, many young students are practicing parade formations. In clubs, people are preparing for various festive activities. The working people of Moscow are awaiting the arrival of the international day of solidarity of the working people with warm and joyful hearts.

    “五一”国际劳动节前夕的莫斯科
    在“五一”节前夕，莫斯科已呈现一片节日欢欣的景象。
    红场及各个广场、街道和建筑物上的节日装饰已经完工了。红场上已划出了节日游行的路线标志。在克里姆林宫对面的莫斯科国营百货公司高大建筑上，装饰着巨大的苏联国徽和十六个加盟共和国的国徽。写着苏联共产党中央委员会庆祝节日口号的红底金字的巨幅标语，把整个建筑物都占满了。红场左边的历史博物馆、不远的列宁中央博物馆、莫斯科大学和大剧院的屋宇上，都闪耀着灿烂的旗帜和标语。高尔基街上的中央电讯局大楼上布置着用美丽的图案环绕着的列宁、斯大林画像和苏联国徽。两旁是苏联和十六个加盟共和国的国旗。夜间，数以万计的五彩电炬辉耀着巨幅的标语和装饰在门楣上的“我国各族人民的兄弟友谊万岁！”的字样。到处红旗飘扬，到处用俄文字母组成的“五一”金色大字在春天的阳光下闪耀。
    这几天来，劳动人民庆祝“五一”节的各种活动已经陆续开始了。在各区的庆祝集会上，劳动人民热烈地表示拥护第四届苏联最高苏维埃第一次会议的各项决议。在各个工厂的庆祝集会上，表扬了在竞赛中获得优异成绩的工人。发起进一步提高劳动生产率的劳动竞赛以迎接“五一”节的莫斯科各工厂，已实践了自己的竞赛诺言。海燕制鞋工厂、米高扬食品工厂、布尔什维克糖果厂等生产消费品的企业，都提前完成了自己的任务。这些工厂准备在“五一”节前还要生产价值一亿卢布以上的产品。
    莫斯科的商店里挤满着购买节日礼品和春夏季服装衣料的人们。电报局里人们在拍发预定在节日致送亲友的祝贺电报。红场上许多青年学生在操练游行的队形。俱乐部里人们在准备节日的各种庆祝活动。莫斯科的劳动人民正在以热烈愉快的心情等待国际劳动人民团结的节日的降临。
