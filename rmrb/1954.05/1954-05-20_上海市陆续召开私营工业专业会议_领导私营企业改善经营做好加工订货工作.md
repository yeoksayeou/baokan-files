Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th: The Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with relevant state-owned companies and industrial trade unions, has been holding private industrial professional meetings for accepting state processing orders since late March. These meetings aim to strengthen management and guide private enterprises in improving operations to ensure the completion of state processing and ordering tasks. To date, professional meetings have been held for eighteen industries including dyeing and weaving, bed sheets, wool textiles, cigarettes, rubber, thermos bottles, sewing machines, and oil extraction.

The professional meetings focused on reviewing and summarizing the previous stage of each industry's completion of state processing and ordering tasks. They further educated private factory owners on the importance of obeying state plans, accepting worker supervision, relying on the working class, and ensuring the timely completion of state tasks in terms of quantity and quality. The review included serious criticism of some capitalists' disregard for state tasks, shoddy workmanship, using inferior products, and delaying delivery times. On the other hand, those capitalists who were willing to obey state plans, relied on the masses, actively improved management, and demonstrated good performance were introduced and encouraged. The meetings comprehensively studied issues in improving business management, enhancing product quality and specifications, saving raw materials, and reducing costs, and pointed out further directions for each industry's efforts.

In Shanghai's private industry, some industries have close interdependencies in production, but in the past, under the condition of each seeking only profit, the relationships between them were very uncoordinated. Taking the raw material factories and the bottle liner factories in the thermos bottle industry as an example, in the off-season for thermos bottles, the bottle liner factories took the opportunity to refuse to purchase or to reduce the purchase price of raw materials from the raw material factories. In the peak season, the raw material factories raised the price of raw materials and used inferior goods. This not only made production difficult for each factory, but also increased product costs, reduced quality, and seriously affected the completion of state processing and ordering tasks. The professional meetings also studied these unreasonable phenomena and led some industries to establish "linkage contracts" or "production and sales agreements."

After attending the professional meetings, many industries have improved their understanding of state processing and ordering and have begun to improve production and management based on the shortcomings in their respective industries.

    上海市陆续召开私营工业专业会议
    领导私营企业改善经营做好加工订货工作
    据新华社上海十九日电：上海市人民政府工商行政管理局自三月下旬以来，会同有关国营公司和产业工会，陆续召开接受国家加工订货的私营工业专业会议，加强管理，领导私营企业改善经营，以保证完成国家的加工订货任务。到现在为止，举行过专业会议的私营工业已有染织、被单、毛纺、卷烟、橡胶、热水瓶、缝纫机、榨油等十八个行业。
    专业会议着重通过检查和总结各行业在前一阶段完成国家加工订货任务的情况，进一步对私营工厂资方作了服从国家计划、接受工人监督和依靠工人阶级、保证按时按质按量完成国家任务的教育。在检查中，一方面对部分资本家漠视国家任务、粗制滥造、以次货充好货以及拖延交货时间的行为作了严肃的批评；另一方面对那些愿意服从国家计划、依靠职工群众积极改善经营并在行动上有一定表现的资本家也予以介绍和鼓励。会议较全面地研究了各行业在改进经营管理、提高品质规格和节约原材料、降低成本等方面的问题，指出了各行业进一步努力的方向。
    上海私营工业中有些行业生产上相互依存的关系很密切，但在过去各自唯利是图的情况下，相互间的关系很不协调。以热水瓶业中的料坯厂和瓶胆厂为例，热水瓶淡销的季节，瓶胆厂便乘机拒绝或者压低价格收买料坯厂的料坯；旺销季节料坯厂又抬高料坯价格和以次货充好货。这不但使各厂生产困难，而且使产品成本增大，质量降低，严重影响国家加工订货任务的完成。对这些不合理现象，专业会议也作了研究，并领导有些行业订立了“联系合约”或“产销协议”。
    不少行业在开过专业会议后，对国家加工订货的认识已有提高，并已开始根据本行业存在的缺点来改进生产和经营。
