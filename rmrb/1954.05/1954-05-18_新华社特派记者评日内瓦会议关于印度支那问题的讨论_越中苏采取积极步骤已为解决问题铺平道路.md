Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent's Commentary on the Geneva Conference Discussions on Indochina
Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union Take Positive Steps, Paving the Way for Problem Resolution

[Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 16th] (Shen Jiantu Reporting) This correspondent reports: The Geneva Conference here has been adjourned for two days, and people are expecting progress when a closed-door meeting on Indochina is held on the 17th. It is generally believed here that the positive steps taken by the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union have paved the way for a swift resolution of the Indochina issue, if Washington does not obstruct progress with increasing interference.

The positive steps taken in just five days are: The eight-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has opened the way for achieving a ceasefire and peace in Indochina on just and honorable terms. The widespread reaction from French public opinion forced the French delegation to deny, at its third press conference within 24 hours, that it had categorically rejected the eight-point proposal.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai stated that the People's Republic of China fully supports the eight-point proposal, believing that these proposals can serve as the basis for the conference to discuss the issue of cessation of war and restoration of peace in Indochina and to adopt appropriate resolutions.

Foreign Minister Molotov supplemented the eight-point proposal by suggesting the establishment of a neutral nation supervisory commission to provide appropriate international supervision over the implementation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.

The Soviet delegation declared its acceptance in principle of the French suggestion that the agreements reached at this conference should be guaranteed by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference, and that in the event of any violation of these agreements, the guaranteeing countries should consult and take collective measures to ensure the implementation of these agreements.

In Geneva, the "Journal de Genève" stated that Molotov's proposal "is generally satisfactory." Another newspaper, the "Tribune de Genève," said in an editorial that this proposal "immediately eased the tense atmosphere of the conference."

British and French newspapers also had to acknowledge that these proposals made a positive contribution to the progress of the conference. The London "Times" correspondent called Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal a "notable contribution." The "Manchester Guardian's" Geneva dispatch was headlined: "Mr. Molotov Makes Concessions; Some Progress in Indochina Talks." French newspapers called the meeting on the 14th (at which the Soviet delegation put forward the proposal) an "important advance." The French newspaper "Franc-Tireur" called it an "important concession."

The British delegation spokesman at the "House of the Press" also had to say, in response to reporters' questions, that Molotov's proposal marked a further development of Pham Van Dong's eight-point proposal. Only the U.S. spokesman and Dulles continued to ignore the progress that had been made.

But after the French government narrowly avoided a crisis by a two-vote margin, there was still no indication that the French delegation, led by Bidault, was determined to seek an honorable peace in Indochina. French observers here do not hide the fact that an agreement on the Indochina issue is being obstructed by Washington. They describe the current French government as a government struggling between two ideas: one is to act according to Washington's wishes, and the other is a more "practical idea," which is to face political and military realities. These observers unanimously believe that the Laniel government is able to survive because of the Geneva Conference, and the French hope that the French delegation will hold negotiations to seek a ceasefire and peace in Indochina.

One of Paris's major newspapers, "Libération," commented on the French government crisis, which was narrowly averted, saying that the lesson Laniel must learn is: "The government's policies must be changed according to the demands of the nation. The people of the whole country want a ceasefire in Vietnam. They also want sincere negotiations in Geneva so that peace can be achieved in Indochina as soon as possible." The newspaper pointed out that Laniel's recent speech on the Indochina issue
  "really means: the French delegation will not sign any agreement to cease hostilities without the consent of the United States or the member states of the Federation."
      "Libération" commented: "Laniel cannot force the National Assembly to accept this policy with his two-vote majority." It is clear from this sentence that this policy will be strongly opposed by all sections of the French people.

Two roads lie ahead for the French government. One leads to a ceasefire expected by the whole world and the establishment of new friendly relations with Indochina. The other road leads to the continuation of the Indochina war and increased U.S. intervention. The latter road means: France becomes more dependent on Washington, continues to shed blood, and suffers greater casualties for the French people.

    新华社特派记者评日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论
    越中苏采取积极步骤已为解决问题铺平道路
    【新华社日内瓦十六日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：这里的日内瓦会议已经休会两天，人们都期望十七日就印度支那问题举行秘密会议时会有进展。这里一般认为，越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表团所采取的积极步骤，已经为迅速解决印度支那问题铺平了道路，如果华盛顿不用越来越多的干涉阻挠进展的话。
    在短短五天之中的积极步骤是：越南民主共和国的八点建议为根据公正和光荣的条件在印度支那实现停火与和平开辟了道路。法国舆论的广泛反响迫使法国代表团在二十四小时以内举行的第三次记者招待会上否认它已断然拒绝八点建议。
    周恩来外长表示中华人民共和国完全支持八点建议，认为这些建议可以成为会议讨论在印度支那停止战争与恢复和平问题并通过适当决议的基础。
    莫洛托夫外长对于八点建议加以补充，他建议建立中立国监督委员会，对于停止敌对行动的协定条款的履行加以适当的国际监督。
    苏联代表团宣称在原则上接受法国的这个建议，就是：在这个会议上达成的协议应由参加日内瓦会议的国家提供保证，在有任何违反这些协议的事情发生的时候，这些提供保证的国家应进行磋商并采取集体措施以保证这些协议的履行。
    在日内瓦，“日内瓦日报”说，对莫洛托夫的建议“一般都感到满意”。另一个报纸“瑞士报”的社论说，这个建议“使会议的紧张气氛立刻缓和下来了”。
    英国和法国报纸也不得不承认这些建议对会议的进展有积极的贡献。伦敦“泰晤士报”记者把莫洛托夫外长的建议称为“值得注意的贡献”。“曼彻斯特卫报”的日内瓦通讯的标题是：“莫洛托夫先生作了让步，印度支那问题的谈判有了一些进展。”法国报纸把十四日那天的会议（苏联代表团就是在这次会议上提出建议的）称为“重要的进展”。法国报纸“义勇军报”把它称为“重要的让步”。
    英国代表团发言人在“记者之家”回答记者的问题时也不得不说，莫洛托夫的建议标志着范文同的八点建议的进一步发展。只有美国的发言人和杜勒斯仍然无视已经取得的进展。
    但是在法国政府以两票之差幸免危机以后，仍然没有迹象表明以皮杜尔为首的法国代表团已经决心谋求印度支那的光荣和平。这里的法国观察家并不隐瞒一个事实，就是关于印度支那问题的协议正受到华盛顿的阻挠。他们把目前的法国政府说成是一个在两种主意之间徬徨苦闷着的政府：一种主意是看华盛顿的眼色行事，另一种是比较“切实的主意”，就是面对政治的和军事的现实。这些观察家一致认为拉尼埃政府所以还能苟延残喘是托日内瓦会议的福，法国人希望法国代表团举行谈判来谋求印度支那的停火与和平。
    巴黎的大报之一“解放报”评论以毫发之差而幸免的法国政府危机说，拉尼埃必须汲取的教训是：“必须按照全国的要求来改变政府的政策。全国人民希望在越南停火。他们还希望在日内瓦举行诚挚的谈判，以便在印度支那尽速实现和平。”该报指出，拉尼埃最近关于印度支那问题的演说的
  “真正意思是：法国代表团如果没有得到美国或是联邦成员国的同意，是不会签订任何协定来停战的。”
      “解放报”评论说：“拉尼埃以他的两票的多数是不能强使国民议会接受这种政策的。”从这句话可以明显看出这种政策将遭到法国各阶层人民的强烈反对。
    法国政府面前摆着两条路。一条引向全世界期待的停火并和印度支那建立新的友好关系。另一条道路引向印度支那战争的继续以及美国的加紧干涉。后一条道路意味着：法国更加依赖华盛顿，继续流血和法国人民更大的伤亡。
