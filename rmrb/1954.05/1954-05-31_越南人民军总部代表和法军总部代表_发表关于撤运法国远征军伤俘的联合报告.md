Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 29th: The joint report from the representatives of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army and the representatives of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces in Indochina regarding the evacuation of wounded and captured members of the French Expeditionary Forces released by the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army from May 13th to 26th, 1954, is as follows:

(1) The delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army and the delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces were in complete agreement that a total of 858 wounded and captured personnel were evacuated, including: 624 Europeans, 150 Africans, and 84 Vietnamese; this included 11 officers, 183 sergeants, and 664 soldiers.

The evacuation procedure was as follows: 11 wounded and captured personnel were evacuated on May 14th; no evacuation occurred on May 15th; no evacuation occurred on May 16th; no evacuation occurred on May 17th; 19 were evacuated on May 18th; 81 were evacuated on May 19th; 48 were evacuated on May 20th; 17 were evacuated on May 21st; 115 were evacuated on May 22nd; 130 were evacuated on May 23rd; 137 were evacuated on May 24th; 151 were evacuated on May 25th; and 149 were evacuated on May 26th. A total of 858 people.

(2) In view of the swift evacuation of the wounded and captured, both delegations expressed satisfaction with the evacuation work.

(3) The delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army would like to point out the following: After the liberation of Dien Bien Phu, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, following the humane policy of President Ho Chi Minh, announced on May 10th, 1954, that it was willing to allow the seriously wounded members of the French Expeditionary Forces to be evacuated from Dien Bien Phu. On May 11th, 1954, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army notified the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces by letter, announcing the decision to release the seriously wounded members of the French Expeditionary Forces in Dien Bien Phu, and requested the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces to send a delegation to Dien Bien Phu. On May 13th, 1954, the delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces, led by Professor Hourtoule, and the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, led by Deputy Division Commander Gao Wenqing, arrived in Dien Bien Phu. The delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces put forward various suggestions to the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, which were immediately accepted. As a result, an agreement was reached on May 13th, 1954. These suggestions regarding the number of wounded and captured personnel to be evacuated, the method of transport, and the cessation of activity of French military aircraft during the evacuation period were approved at the time by General Cogny, representing the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces in Indochina.

The evacuation work began immediately on May 14th, 1954. However, the rescue planes did not come to evacuate the wounded on May 15th and 16th. On May 16th, the French General Headquarters sent a delegation composed of Major James and Major Roger to put forward new proposals. On May 17th, the French General Headquarters unilaterally cancelled the May 13th agreement without prior notice to the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army and put forward new proposals. Six hours later, on the evening of May 17th and the morning of May 18th, as "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast on May 18th, the French Air Force bombed Highway 41 between Son La and Dien Bien Phu, killing and wounding 15 prisoners of war. This was an act of blatant violation of the May 13th agreement. The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army lodged a strong protest against this. Subsequently, incidents violating the May 13th agreement occurred several times on Highway 41, particularly the bombing near Xinlan at 8:00 p.m. on May 18th, and the bombing of areas 5 to 7 kilometers from the center of Dien Bien Phu on the evening of May 23rd and the morning of May 24th. Despite these violations of the agreement, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army continued to pursue a humane policy, abide by the May 13th agreement, and provide various facilities for the evacuation work; therefore, the evacuation of the wounded could proceed as planned (letter from Deputy Division Commander Gao Wenqing, May 17th, 1954).

On May 22nd, 1954, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army rejected the French General Headquarters' proposal of May 17th. It decided that the evacuation of the wounded should be carried out in accordance with the method stipulated in the May 13th agreement, and agreed to the French side's request to repair the airfield for Dakota aircraft to land. On May 24th, 1954, after consulting with experts from both sides, the French delegation automatically withdrew its request to repair the airfield for Dakota aircraft to land, because repairing the airfield would not save more time than the current evacuation techniques. This suggestion was made at the time by General Cogny on behalf of the French General Headquarters in a letter given to the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army. The evacuation of the wounded began on May 14th and was completed at 3:00 p.m. on May 26th. Among all the 858 wounded evacuated, there were Europeans, Africans, and Vietnamese belonging to the puppet army. In addition, in accordance with the order of President Ho Chi Minh, nurse Geneviève de Galard, was released and had been evacuated by plane on May 24th.

The delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army protested the actions of the French General Headquarters in violating the May 13th agreement and risking the creation of a tense atmosphere fundamentally detrimental to the evacuation of the wounded.

(4) The delegation of the French General Headquarters acknowledged that the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army had strictly adhered to the May 13th agreement, which the French General Headquarters had violated on May 17th without prior notice to the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army. The delegation of the French General Headquarters expressed its respect for President Ho Chi Minh's generous policy, and thanked the personnel of the Vietnam People's Army for enabling the evacuation of the wounded to proceed under the best conditions, and especially thanked the medical personnel of the Vietnam People's Army for the care given to the wounded members of the French Expeditionary Forces from the time Dien Bien Phu changed hands until the evacuation of the wounded.

The delegation of the French General Headquarters also noted with satisfaction that nurse Geneviève de Galard, who was released due to the generosity of President Ho Chi Minh, had been evacuated.

The delegation of the French General Headquarters commended the relationship between the personnel that greatly facilitated the work of the two delegations, and expressed its gratitude to the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army for their hospitality.

    越南人民军总部代表和法军总部代表
    发表关于撤运法国远征军伤俘的联合报告
    【新华社三十日讯】越南通讯社二十九日讯：越南人民军总司令部代表与印度支那法国远征军总司令部代表关于由一九五四年五月十三日到二十六日撤运被越南人民军总司令部释放的法国远征军伤俘的联合报告，全文如下：
    （一）越南人民军总司令部代表团与法国远征军总司令部代表团彼此完全同意：撤运的伤俘共计八百五十八人，其中计有：欧洲人六百二十四名，非洲人一百五十名，越南人八十四名；其中包括军官十一人，军士一百八十三人，士兵六百六十四人。
    撤运的程序如下：五月十四日撤运伤俘十一名；五月十五日没有撤运；五月十六日没有撤运；五月十七日没有撤运；五月十八日撤运十九名；五月十九日撤运八十一名；五月二十日撤运四十八名；五月二十一日撤运十七名；五月二十二日撤运一百一十五名；五月二十三日撤运一百三十名；五月二十四日撤运一百三十七名；五月二十五日撤运一百五十一名；五月二十六日撤运一百四十九名。共计八百五十八名。
    （二）鉴于伤俘撤运的迅速，双方代表团对于撤运工作表示满意。
      （三）越南人民军总司令部代表团愿意指出以下各点：在奠边府解放以后，越南民主共和国政府遵循胡志明主席的人道政策，于一九五四年五月十日宣布，愿意让法国远征军的重伤员自奠边府撤走。一九五四年五月十一日，越南人民军总司令部以函件通知法国远征军总司令部，宣布决定释放奠边府法国远征军的重伤员，并请法国远征军总司令部派遣代表团到奠边府来。一九五四年五月十三日，由胡尔教授率领的法国远征军总司令部代表团和由高文庆副师长率领的越南人民军总司令部代表团都到了奠边府。法国远征军总司令部代表团向越南人民军总司令部代表团提出各项建议，越南人民军总司令部代表团立刻接受了这些建议。于是在一九五四年五月十三日达成了协议。这些关于撤运伤俘的人数、运输的方法以及在撤运期间法军飞机停止活动的建议，当时曾经得到代表印度支那法国远征军总司令部的戈涅将军的批准。
    撤运工作在一九五四年五月十四日立即开始了。但是，救护机在五月十五日和十六日没有前来撤运伤员。五月十六日，法军总司令部派遣了由詹姆斯少校和罗杰少校组成的代表团前来提出新的建议。五月十七日，法军总司令部没有预先通知越南人民军总司令部就片面取消了五月十三日的协议，并提出新的建议。六小时后，在五月十七日晚和五月十八日早晨，如“越南之声”电台在五月十八日所发表的，法国空军就空袭山萝和奠边府之间的第四十一号公路，毙伤十五名战俘。这是一种公然破坏五月十三日的协议的举动。越南人民军总司令部对此提出了强硬的抗议。其后，破坏五月十三日协议的事件在第四十一号公路上发生过好多次，特别是在五月十八日晚上八时对新兰附近进行的轰炸和五月二十三日晚上及五月二十四日早晨对离奠边府中心五到七公里的地区进行的轰炸。尽管有这些违反协议的举动，越南人民军总司令部还是继续奉行人道政策，遵守五月十三日的协议，并给撤运工作各种便利；因此，撤运伤员的工作能够按照预计的方式进行（高文庆副师长一九五四年五月十七日的信件）。
    一九五四年五月二十二日，越南人民军总司令部拒绝了法军总司令部五月十七日的建议。它决定撤运伤员的工作应按照五月十三日的协议中规定的方式进行，并同意法军方面的关于修理机场以便达科他式飞机着陆的要求。一九五四年五月二十四日，在征求了双方专家们的意见后，法军代表团自动撤回了关于修理机场以便达科他式飞机着陆的要求，因为修理机场的工作并不比按照当前的撤运技术进行的工作省时间。这个建议是当时由戈涅将军在交给越南人民军代表团的一个函件中代表法军总司令部提出的。伤员的撤运工作于五月十四日开始，五月二十六日午后三时完成。在所有撤走了的八百五十八名伤员中，有欧洲人、非洲人和属于伪军的越南人。此外，还遵照胡志明主席的命令，释放了女护士杰尼维夫·德格拉尔，她已在五月二十四日由飞机撤运回去。
    越南人民军总司令部代表团抗议法军总司令部破坏五月十三日的协议、甘冒制造根本不利于伤员撤运工作的紧张气氛的危险的行为。
    （四）法军总司令部代表团承认，越南人民军总司令部一直严格遵守法军总司令部在五月十七日未曾事先通知越南人民军总司令部就予以破坏的五月十三日的协议。法军总司令部代表团对胡志明主席的宽大政策表示敬意，并感谢越南人民军人员使得伤员的撤运工作能在最好的条件下进行，特别是感谢越南人民军救护人员在从奠边府易手到伤员撤离期间给予法国远征军伤员的照顾。
    法军总司令部代表团同时满意地指出，由于胡志明主席的宽大而被释放的女护士杰尼维夫·德格拉尔已经撤走。
    法军总司令部代表团称赞大大促进了两个代表团的工作的人员的关系，并对越南人民军代表团的款待表示感谢。
