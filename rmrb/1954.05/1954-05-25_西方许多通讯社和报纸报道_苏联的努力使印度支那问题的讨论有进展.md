Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 23rd: On the 22nd, Western newspapers reported on the news of the fourth secret meeting on the Indochina issue with an optimistic tone, pointing out that the discussion of the Indochina issue had taken a step forward due to Molotov's constructive efforts. A special correspondent of the "Lausanne Gazette" reported on the situation of the fourth secret meeting on the Indochina issue on the 21st, saying: "The overall impression after the meeting is that the negotiations on the Indochina ceasefire have indeed made progress." The "Swiss Newspaper" quoted a person who attended the meeting as saying that the meeting "did a very good job, and the atmosphere was not as cold as in the past." The "Journal de Genève" wrote: "Friday's meeting was polite, and the atmosphere was better than in the past." Both newspapers pointed out that the meeting touched on the discussion of the Indochina ceasefire.

Agence France-Presse said: "The Paris newspapers all view with obvious relief the fact that the Indochina Conference is not only proceeding but will enter a decisive stage - starting next week, the general principles of the Vietnam armistice negotiations will be discussed." "L'Aurore" emphasized: "The agreement reached yesterday is undoubtedly a great step forward." "Le Parisien Libéré" wrote: "Molotov's five-point proposal proves that yesterday was the most important day of the Geneva Conference." "Franc-Tireur" wrote: "The meeting will start a new starting point next week." "Combat" fully estimated what the newspaper called "this clarification of the diplomatic situation," pointing out that "next week will undoubtedly be a decisive week."

The "Manchester Guardian" said that a starting point has finally been found in Geneva. News from Geneva said: "The nine countries trying to end the Indochina War decided yesterday, under Molotov's proposal, to discuss a five-point ceasefire plan at a secret meeting next Monday."

The "News Chronicle" wrote under the headline "Ceasefire Negotiations Agreed": "The nine countries trying to end the Indochina War decided today to discuss a five-point ceasefire plan at the next secret meeting on Monday." The "Daily Herald" said that when the negotiations between the East and the West reached a crisis point here, the Soviet representative put forward a surprising five-point plan for a ceasefire in Indochina, and Eden and Bidault accepted this plan as a basis for further discussion. A representative attending the meeting commented: The meeting has made important progress. The newspaper revealed that the five issues that Molotov proposed the meeting should discuss first are as follows: (1) Simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina; (2) Establishing areas for the concentration of troops of both sides in the three Indochinese countries; (3) Prohibition of reinforcement of troops and military supplies to both sides from abroad; (4) Establishing international institutions to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement; (5) Concluding international guarantees to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.

    西方许多通讯社和报纸报道
    苏联的努力使印度支那问题的讨论有进展
    【新华社日内瓦二十三日电】二十二日西方报纸都以乐观的口吻报道了关于印度支那问题的第四次秘密会议的消息，指出由于莫洛托夫的建设性的努力，印度支那问题的讨论前进了一步。“洛桑日报”特派记者报道二十一日印度支那问题第四次秘密会议情况时说：“会后总的影响是关于印度支那停火的谈判确有进展。”“瑞士报”引一位参加会议的人士的话说，会议“工作做的很好，气氛也不像过去的冷淡”。“日内瓦日报”写道：“星期五的会议是有礼貌的，气氛比过去好。”上述两报都指出会议接触了印度支那停火的讨论。
    法新社说：“巴黎各报都以显而易见的松了口气的心情来看待这一事实，即是印度支那会议不但在进行而且将进入决定性的阶段——自下星期一起讨论越南停战谈判的一般原则。”“震旦报”着重指出：“昨日获致的协议毫无疑问是向前大大进了一步。”“解放了的巴黎人报”写道：“莫洛托夫的五点建议证明了昨天是日内瓦会议最重要的一天。”“义勇军报”写道：“会议将于下星期一开始一个新的起点。”“战斗报”充分估量了该报所谓“这种外交局面上的明朗化”，指出“下星期无疑将是决定的一星期”。
      “曼彻斯特卫报”说，在日内瓦终于找到了一个起点。来自日内瓦的消息说：“试图结束印度支那战争的九个国家，昨日在莫洛托夫建议之下决定于下星期一的秘密会议上讨论一个五点停战计划。”
      “新闻纪事报”在“停战谈判已获同意”的标题下写道：“试图结束印度支那战争的九个国家今日决定星期一下次秘密会议上讨论一个五点停战计划。”“每日先驱报”说，此间东西方的谈判达到危机点时，苏联代表提出了在印度支那停战的一项惊人的五点计划，艾登和皮杜尔接受了此项计划作为进一步讨论的基础。出席会议的一个代表评论道：会议获致重要的进展。报纸透露莫洛托夫提出会议应首先讨论的五个问题如下：（一）在印度支那全境同时停火；（二）在印度支那三国建立双方军队集结的区域；（三）禁止从境外对双方军队的兵员和军火的增援；（四）建立监察停战协议实施的国际机构；（五）缔结保证停战协议履行的国际保证。
