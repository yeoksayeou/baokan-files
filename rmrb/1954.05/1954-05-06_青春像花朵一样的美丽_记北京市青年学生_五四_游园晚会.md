Youth is as Beautiful as a Flower
—A Record of the Beijing Youth Students' "May Fourth" Garden Party
By our reporter Bai Sheng

　　On the night of the fourth, Zhongshan Park was decorated so beautifully, brightly lit, and filled with the joyous songs of young people. The blooming peonies and wisteria flowers exuded a rich fragrance, and even the ancient cypress trees seemed extraordinarily young. Under the colorful illuminated trees, under the red gauze lanterns, under the wisteria trellises, beside the peony flowerbeds, and next to the newly laid five-colored flower terraces, young people were laughing, singing, dancing, and talking, their eyes shining with boundless joy.

　　Tens of thousands of young people—young workers, young soldiers, young students, young cadres, labor models, combat heroes, as well as young guests from the Soviet Union and young international students from various people's democratic countries—came to this beautiful garden to commemorate this glorious and combative festival for Chinese youth.

　　In the auditorium, at the capital's youth gathering to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement and welcome the Soviet youth delegation, the dearest young friends from Moscow were warmly welcomed by their young hosts. The distinguished guests also offered precious blessings to their young hosts. The head of the Soviet youth delegation, Mr. Seleznev, expressed warm congratulations to the Chinese youth for their outstanding achievements in the construction of the motherland.

　　When the military band of the General Staff Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission and the band of the Renmin University of China played youth carnival music on the Altar of Earth and Grain, young girls and boys happily spun around the wide altar in pairs, the dazzling lights shining on their smiling faces, and the brightly colored skirts fluttering in the wind. What a sweet and happy night, the hearts of young people blossomed like flowers. Here were young men and women in brightly colored ethnic costumes, as well as young democratic guests from various countries in festive attire. As another youth dance tune began, the young hosts invited the guests, singing like birds as they strolled and danced lightly. The head of the Soviet youth delegation, Mr. Seleznev, danced with a girl in a brightly colored ethnic costume; the young hosts warmly surrounded the guests, holding their arms tightly, singing the same heartfelt song in different languages: the resounding song of "Moscow - Beijing." They were filled with deep emotion, exchanging commemorative gifts. The head of the Central Military Sports Department of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, Mr. Zubkov, kindly pinned the many Komsomol commemorative badges he had brought one by one on the chests of the young soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The female students surrounded the female representatives of the Soviet youth delegation, pinning their school badges on her lapel. Young foreign students expressed their admiration for the young people of New China in Chinese. Lan Yanni, a student from the German Democratic Republic studying at Peking University, came to the garden party in the beautiful and solemn uniform of a Free German Youth League member. She danced and sang with the young soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, conversing with them in Chinese. Throughout the garden, from the Altar of Earth and Grain to the Laijin Yuxuan, from the Western Grove to the Rear Grove, and then to the South Gate of the Altar, the unrestrained songs of young people resounded everywhere. Young workers firmly grasped the hands of young artillery heroes, and female students beat out loud rhythms, dancing youth collective dances.

　　Wonderful performances began. The song and dance "Festival" performed by the Tibetan youth of the Central Institute for Nationalities Art Troupe sang the joy of the Tibetan youth in the spring festival: in the wide grassland, dance floors were everywhere for young people, like a group of amorous peacocks spreading their wings. The hope of the grassland blooms like flowers in spring, the joy of youth grows wings like the heart. ……

　　The Miao youth used the "Wedding Dance" to express their happy life after liberation. The Kazakh youth showed the great power of labor with a dance full of youthful vitality. The Uyghur youth expressed the youth's yearning for peace with a sonorous song. The art troupe of the Railway Corps sang a "Katyusha." In every program, there are young people's beautiful ideals and hopes.

　　As colorful fireworks rose into the night sky, the garden party was coming to an end. What a happy night it was, in this peaceful and democratic garden, youth is as beautiful as a flower, and it will emit even greater brilliance in the struggle for peace and democracy.

    青春像花朵一样的美丽
    ——记北京市青年学生“五四”游园晚会

    四日夜里，中山公园打扮得这样美丽，灯火辉煌，到处荡漾着青年人欢愉的歌声。盛开的牡丹花、藤萝花，散放着浓郁的芬芳，古老的柏树也显得分外年青。在彩色的灯树下，在红色的纱灯下，在藤萝花架下，在牡丹花畦的边上，在新铺的五色花坛旁，青年人在欢笑，在歌舞，在倾谈，他们的眼睛里闪耀着无限喜悦的光芒。
    成千上万的青年——青年工人、青年战士、青年学生、青年干部、劳动模范、战斗英雄，还有那来自苏联的青年嘉宾和各人民民主国家的青年留学生，都来到了这座美丽的花园里，纪念这中国青年光辉的战斗的节日。
    音乐堂里，在首都各界青年纪念“五四”三十五周年和欢迎苏联青年代表团大会的会场上，来自莫斯科的最亲爱的青年友人，受到了年青主人的热烈欢迎。贵宾们也向年青的主人道出了珍贵的祝福。苏联青年代表团团长谢列平，对中国青年在祖国建设中的卓越成就，表示了热烈的祝贺。
    当中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总参谋部的军乐团和中国人民大学的乐队在社稷坛奏起了青年狂欢舞曲的时候，年轻的姑娘们和小伙子们一双双幸福地在宽阔的坛前旋转起来，绚丽的灯光照耀着他们的笑靥，鲜艳的彩裙在迎风飘动。这是个多么甜美幸福的夜晚，青年人的心像鲜花一样地开放。这里有穿着颜色鲜艳的民族服装的青年男女，也有穿着节日盛装的各国民主青年嘉宾。当又一支青年舞曲奏起时，年青的主人邀请嘉宾，像鸟儿一样歌唱着漫步轻舞起来。苏联青年代表团团长谢列平，和穿着鲜艳的民族服装的姑娘跳着舞；年青的主人热情地簇拥着嘉宾们，紧紧地挽着他们的臂膀，用不同的语言唱出了同一心声：“莫斯科——北京”的响亮歌声。他们充满着深厚的感情，交换着纪念的礼物。苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央军事体育部部长朱布科夫亲切地把带来的许多共青团纪念章一一戴在人民解放军青年战士的胸前。女学生们把苏联青年代表团的女代表包围起来，将自己的校徽佩在她的衣襟上。年青的外国留学生用中国话道出了他们对新中国青年的爱慕。在北京大学学习的民主德国留学生蓝燕妮，穿着草绿色的自由德国青年联盟盟员的美丽庄严的制服，来参加这个游园盛会。她和人民解放军的青年战士们一起歌舞着，用中国话和他们交谈着。满园里，从社稷坛到来今雨轩，从西树林到后树林，再到坛南门，到处荡漾着青年人纵情的歌声。年青的工人，紧紧握住青年炮兵英雄的手，女学生们打着响亮的节拍，跳起青年集体舞来了。
    精采的表演节目开始了。中央民族学院文工团藏族青年表演的歌舞“节日”，唱出了藏族青年在春天节日里的喜悦：在宽阔的草地上，到处是青年的舞场，像一群多情的孔雀都展开了翅膀。草原上的希望，像鲜花在春天里开放，青年的欢乐，像心儿长了翅膀。………………
    苗族青年用“婚礼舞”表现了解放后的幸福生活。哈萨克青年以充满青春活力的舞蹈，显示出劳动的伟大力量。维吾尔族青年用嘹亮的歌声，表达了青年人对和平的热望。铁道部队的文工团歌唱了一支“喀秋莎”。在每一个节目里，都蕴藏着青年人美好的理想和希望。
    当彩色缤纷的焰火升入夜空时，游园晚会快要结束了。这是个多么幸福的夜晚，在这和平民主的大花园里，青春像花朵一样的美丽，它将在争取和平民主的斗争中发射出更大的光彩。
