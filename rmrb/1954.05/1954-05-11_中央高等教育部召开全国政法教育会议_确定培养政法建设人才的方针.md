Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The National Conference on Political and Legal Education convened by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education concluded on May 8th. This conference defined the direction and tasks of political and legal education, clarifying its importance in improving the people's democratic legal system, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and safeguarding socialist construction. In order to ensure the cultivation of qualified, high-level talent for political and legal construction, a unified teaching plan for political and legal departments was drafted.

The basic task of political and legal work during the state's transition period is:
"To further improve the people's democratic system, strengthen and utilize the people's democratic legal system, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings." According to the above basic tasks, the conference determined that the future direction of political and legal education is: To adapt to the needs of the development of political and legal work, and to cultivate, in a planned and proportionate manner, working cadres and jurists who are loyal to the cause of socialist construction, love the motherland, are physically healthy, possess a firm working-class standpoint and socialist political and legal viewpoints, master advanced political and legal science, and are familiar with specialized political and legal work. In order to cultivate talents that meet these requirements, it is necessary to implement the working principles of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady progress." In the future, political and legal education work should first further implement the teaching policy of combining theory with practice and combining the study of advanced Soviet experience with China's actual conditions, actively carry out teaching reforms, and improve quality. The Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government plans to conduct rotational training for the backbone and leading cadres of political and legal departments at all levels above the county (city) level within the next two to three years. To this end, the national political and legal departments should currently focus on short-term rotational training for in-service cadres and pay close attention to cultivating students in junior college and above, on the one hand improving in-service cadres and on the other hand cultivating specialized talents, to meet the current needs of work and future development; and graduates of political and legal colleges and universities will participate in the forefront of class struggle, and increasing the proportion of worker-peasant students in various colleges and universities is particularly important. Law departments of comprehensive universities and undergraduate political and legal colleges should enroll more worker-peasant cadres and in-service cadres, and should also enroll young students with good political qualities to train them to become the backbone of political and legal construction. This is the main symbol of the correct embodiment of the class line in higher political and legal education. During the period of the first five-year plan, the national political and legal departments plan to enroll 10,000 students. Under the guidance of the Central Political and Legal Committee, the Central Higher Education Ministry will strengthen the teaching work of existing higher political and legal colleges and universities nationwide, and first concentrate its efforts on running the Law Department of the Chinese People's University, the Law Department of Peking University, and the Beijing College of Political Science and Law well, in order to accumulate experience, train teachers, and prepare teaching materials, to create conditions for future development.

The conference determined the specific tasks, training objectives, and study periods of political and legal departments. In the next few years, each political and legal college should undertake the dual tasks of long-term training of specialized talents and short-term rotational training of in-service cadres. The undergraduate program of political and legal colleges mainly trains political and legal work cadres for courts, procuratorates, civil affairs departments, and other state organs, and the length of study is set at four years. The training goals of law departments of comprehensive universities are basically the same as those of various political and legal colleges in the next few years, and also train some legal professionals for lawyers' groups, notary offices, and other state organs and enterprise departments, and the length of study is also set at four years. The Law Department of the Chinese People's University should continue to recruit graduate students to train teachers and some legal science researchers for various political and legal colleges and universities.

The conference pointed out that the teaching reform work of political and legal education is more urgent and necessary than other departments. All old legal viewpoints must be thoroughly criticized, and new political and legal science must be established on the basis of combining theory with practice and combining the study of advanced Soviet experience with China's actual conditions; it is necessary to oppose both conservative ideas of sticking to old ways and impractical formalism. This requires first strengthening political and ideological leadership. All colleges and universities must enable all teachers and students to earnestly and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and advanced Soviet political and legal science, and deeply study the general line, and continuously improve socialist awareness; only in this way can they be good at summarizing the practical experience of political and legal work in New China, understand the spirit of the people's democratic legal system, and gradually enrich the teaching content with the political and legal science of New China and the people's democratic legal system, and cultivate qualified senior political and legal talents.

The conference believes that a regular system of political theory study and professional training for teachers should be gradually established, criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, a academic style of free discussion should be established, and the political and professional level of teachers should be continuously improved by criticizing all reactionary old legal viewpoints and bourgeois academic ideas. In addition, it is also necessary to organize teachers to study policies and laws, study practical materials, participate in certain professional conferences and practical work, so that political and legal theory education is closely integrated with practical political and legal work.

    中央高等教育部召开全国政法教育会议
    确定培养政法建设人才的方针
    【新华社十日讯】中央人民政府高等教育部召开的全国政法教育会议已在五月八日结束。这次会议规定了政法教育的方针任务，明确了政法教育在健全人民民主法制、巩固人民民主专政、保卫社会主义建设中的重要性。为了保证培养合格的高级政法建设人才，并拟订了政法院系的统一的教学计划。
    在国家过渡时期的政法工作的基本任务是：
  “进一步健全人民民主制度，加强和运用人民民主法制，巩固人民民主专政，以保障国家的社会主义经济建设和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行”；会议根据上述的基本任务，确定今后政法教育的方针是：适应政法工作发展的需要，有计划按比例地培养忠于社会主义建设事业、热爱祖国、体格健全、具有坚定的工人阶级立场和社会主义的政法观点，掌握先进政法科学、熟悉专门政法业务的工作干部和法学家。为培养合乎这种要求的人才，必须根据
  “整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针，今后在政法教育工作中应首先进一步贯彻理论与实际相结合，学习苏联先进经验与中国实际情况相结合的教学方针，积极进行教学改革，提高质量。中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会准备在今后二、三年内将县（市）以上各级政法部门的骨干和领导干部轮训一遍。为此，全国政法院系目前应以短期轮训在职干部为主并切实注意培养专科以上学校学生，一方面提高在职干部，一方面培养专门人才，以适应工作目前的需要和将来的发展；而政法院校的毕业生将参加阶级斗争最前列的工作，增加各院校工农学生的比重，显得尤为重要，各综合大学法律系和政法学院本科应多招收工农干部和在职干部，也应招收政治质量较好的青年学生，培养他们成为政法建设中的骨干。这是高等政法教育正确体现阶级路线的主要标志。在第一个五年计划时期内，全国政法院系计划招生一万名。中央高等教育部在中央政法委员会指导下，将加强全国现有高等政法院校的教学工作，并首先集中力量将中国人民大学法律系、北京大学法律系和北京政法学院办好，以积累经验、培养教师、准备教材，为将来发展创造条件。
    会议确定了政法院系的具体任务、培养目标及学习年限。各政法学院在最近几年内，应担负长期培养专门人材和短期轮训在职干部的双重任务。政法学院本科主要是培养法院、检察署、民政部门及其他国家机关的政法工作干部，学制定为四年。综合大学法律系的培养目标，在最近几年内基本上与各政法学院相同，并培养一部分律师团体、公证所以及其他国家机关、企业部门的法律专门人材，学制也定为四年。中国人民大学法律系并应继续招收研究生，为各政法院校培养师资和一部分法律科学研究人员。
    会议指出，政法教育的教学改革工作，比其他系科更为迫切和必要。一切旧法观点必须彻底批判，新的政法科学必须在理论与实际相结合、学习苏联先进经验与中国实际情况相结合的基础上建立起来；既要反对故步自封的保守思想，又要反对不切实际的形式主义作风。这就要首先加强政治思想领导。各院校必须使全体师生认真地有系统地学习马克思列宁主义和苏联先进政法科学，并深入地学习总路线，不断提高社会主义觉悟；这样，才能善于总结新中国政法工作的实际经验，体会人民民主法制的精神，并逐步以新中国的政法科学和人民民主法制来丰富教学内容，培养合格的高级政法人材。
    会议认为：应逐步建立教师正规的政治理论学习和业务进修制度，开展批评与自我批评，树立学术自由讨论的学风，并通过批判一切反动的旧法观点及资产阶级学术思想，不断提高教师的政治和业务水平。此外，还须组织教师研究政策法令，研究实际资料，参加某些专业会议和实际工作，使政法理论教育与政法实际工作密切结合。
