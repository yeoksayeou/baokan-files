    New Coking Coalfield Discovered Near Shuangyashan Coal Mine in Jiamusi, Songjiang Province
    Many Peat Layers Discovered in Coastal Areas of Fujian Province
    In the adjacent area of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine, more than 70 kilometers east of Jiamusi City, Songjiang Province, a coking coalfield with extremely abundant reserves has been discovered. Preliminary results from a general survey by the geological exploration team confirm that the area of this coalfield is more than 300 square kilometers, with four or five mineable coal seams. To further ascertain underground resources, geological exploration personnel and drilling workers affiliated with the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau are further conducting detailed exploration work such as trench exploration and tunnel exploration, and drilling has begun in some areas to provide design data for the construction of new vertical and inclined shafts this year and next year.

    Recently, many peat layers have been successively discovered in the coastal areas of Fujian Province. Among them, the peat layers in the Putian area are only about one zhang [approximately 3.3 meters] from the ground, making mining very convenient, and the local people often dig it out for use as fuel.
    The East China Administrative Committee's Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Fujian Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry, Department of Agriculture, Fujian Agricultural College, and other relevant departments attach great importance to this discovery and have jointly sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections. According to preliminary analysis, the peat in various places contains nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and relatively rich organic compounds, and it can become a very good organic fertilizer with slight processing. If it is used as fuel, it can also replace a large amount of firewood. At present, the Putian State-owned Farm has used peat as a mixed fertilizer for early rice and as bedding for pigsties for experimentation. The Fujian Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry is studying the value of using peat as fuel, and Fujian Agricultural College has also listed it as one of the comprehensive research topics to further study how to fully utilize this newly discovered resource in the future.

    松江省佳木斯双鸭煤矿附近发现新焦煤田
    福建省沿海地区发现许多泥炭矿层
    在松江省佳木斯市东面七十多公里的双鸭煤矿的毗邻地区，发现了一片埋藏量极为丰富的炼焦煤煤田。经地质勘察队普查结果初步证实，这片煤田的面积达三百多平方公里，可采的煤层有四五层。为进一步查清地下资源，双鸭矿务局所属的地质勘察人员和钻探工人正在进一步进行槽探、洞探等详查工作，部分地区并已开始钻探，为今年和明年建设新的竖井、斜井提供设计资料。（新华社）

    福建省沿海地区最近相继发现许多泥炭矿层。其中莆田一带的泥炭矿层距离地面只有一丈左右，开采起来很方便，当地人民群众常常把它挖掘出来作燃料用。
    华东行政委员会农林水利局、华东农业科学研究所和福建省人民政府工业厅、农业厅、福建农学院等有关部门对这一发现都非常重视，曾联合派人到现场考察。据初步分析，各地的泥炭都含有氮素、磷酸和比较丰富的有机化合物，只要稍加处理，就可以成为一种很好的有机质肥料。如果用它作为燃料，也可以代替大量的木材燃料。目前，莆田国营农场已把泥炭作为早稻混合肥料和猪舍垫土，进行实验，福建省人民政府工业厅正在研究用泥炭作为燃料的价值，福建农学院也把它列为综合性研究专题之一，以进一步研究今后如何充分利用这种新发现的资源。（新华社）
