Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Promotes the Teaching Experiences of Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai
A Technical Learning Craze Sweeps Through Young Workers Throughout the Plant

The Communist Youth League Committee of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has, over the past year, cultivated a pair of master and apprentice, Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai, who have achieved great teaching success. It has systematically promoted their teaching experiences, sparking a technical learning craze among young workers and rapidly improving their technical skills.

Master Xu Fuyan is a young technician with eight years of experience, while apprentice Liu Haihai came to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant from the countryside in June 1952, and in September of the same year became an apprentice in the milling and turning group of the repair shop. Under the education of the League, and with the spirit of "teaching for the motherland, learning for the motherland," they quickly achieved outstanding results. Liu Haihai was able to operate the lathe independently after only forty days of learning, and was promoted to a Grade Two worker in less than three months. In the increased production and frugality campaign last year, when milling the grooves of rolling mill rolls, he created an automatic testing device, which shortened auxiliary time and increased work efficiency by more than thirteen times compared to the past. He also improved the turning method, using pressure plates to replace wooden sticks for clamping, shortening the time for milling each roll by forty minutes. When milling brake shoes for the transportation department, he used a flow-line operation method, increasing production efficiency by seven and a half times. When making copper tiles for rolling steel, he improved the tool (core rod), saving clamping and correction time, and increasing work efficiency by thirteen times. In addition, Liu Haihai is also a model in maintaining machine tools and being responsible for checking machines. He has not had a single accident in the year he has been participating in production, achieving safe production. His attendance rate for the year reached 98.9%, and he actively participates in extracurricular activities and cares about the lives of the masses, and was therefore elected as a district people's representative.

After the advanced ideas and advanced teaching experiences of Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai were vigorously promoted by the Communist Youth League Committee of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, they have become learning models for the vast number of young people throughout the plant. Under the influence of Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai, many young workers have greatly improved their enthusiasm and consciousness for teaching and learning technology. According to statistics from twelve workshops throughout the plant, from January to mid-March this year, 309 new master-apprentice contracts were signed, there were 80 technical mutual assistance groups, 3 technical classes, and 8 vocational study classes (the above participation totaled 2,904 people, including 1,829 young people). Sixty-four young people were upgraded after studying and taking exams, and 124 young people have reached the upgrade standard after taking exams. For example, Bai Zhimei, a 17-year-old female League member and steel forging worker, learned from Liu Haihai's advanced experience and learned the content of the four-month master-apprentice contract two months ahead of schedule, and can operate the steam hammer independently. With the continuous improvement of the technical level of young workers, examples of technological innovation have become widespread throughout the plant. According to statistics from January to mid-March this year, the plant's employees found a total of 498 tricks, of which 333 were found by young workers, accounting for 61% of the total. 107 have been implemented, and 60 have been successfully tested and are being implemented. For example, Gao Shigong, a young League member and electrician in the coking department, proposed nine automation and mechanization tricks in three months, of which three have been put into production.

    太原钢铁厂推广许福延和刘还海教学经验
    全厂青年工人掀起学习技术热潮
    青年团太原钢铁厂委员会，一年多来培养了一对有巨大教学成就的师徒——许福延和刘还海，并把他们教学经验有计划地推广，掀起了青年工人学习技术的热潮，迅速提高了青年工人的技术水平。
    师傅许福延是一个有八年工龄的青年技工，徒弟刘还海在一九五二年六月才从农村来到太原钢铁厂，当年九月到修造部铣车组当学徒。他们俩人在团的教育下，本着“为祖国而教，为祖国而学”的精神，迅速取得了出色的成绩。刘还海仅仅学了四十多天就能上车单独操作，不到三个月就被提升为二级工人。在去年增产节约运动中铣轧辊槽子时，他创造了自动检验器，缩短了辅助时间，工作效率比过去提高了十三倍多；又改进转活法，用压板代替木棍夹活，每铣一个轧辊缩短了四十分钟。他在铣运输部的闸瓦时，用流水作业法，提高生产效率七倍半。又在做轧钢的铜瓦时，他改进了工具（心子杆），节省了卡活校正时间，提高工作效率十三倍。此外，刘还海在维护机床和认真负责检查机器上也是个模范，他参加生产一年来没有出过一次事故，达到了安全生产。一年来他的出勤率达到百分之九十八点九，并积极参加业余活动，关心群众生活，因而当选了区人民代表。
    许福延、刘还海的先进思想和先进教学经验，经青年团太原钢铁厂委员会大力推广后，已成为全厂广大青年的学习榜样，许多青年职工在许福延、刘还海的影响下，大大提高了教学技术的积极性和自觉性。据全厂十二个车间的统计，今年一月至三月中旬新增加师徒合同就有三○九份，技术互助组八十个，技术班三个，业务学习班八个（以上参加人数共有二千九百零四人，其中青年一千八百二十九人），有六十四个青年经过学习考工升了级，一百二十四个青年经过考工已达到升级标准。如十七岁的女团员锻钢工人白芝梅，学习了刘还海先进经验，提前二个月就学会了四个月的师徒合同内容，而且能单独操作汽锤。随着青年工人技术水平不断的提高，生产技术革新的事例普及全厂。据今年一月至三月中旬的统计，全厂职工共找到窍门四百九十八件，其中青年工人找到的窍门有三百三十三件，占总数的百分之六十一，其中已实现的有一百零七件，已试验成功，正在执行的有六十件。如炼焦部电器工青年团员高世恭三个月时间就提出自动化机械化窍门九件，其中已有三项投入了生产。
