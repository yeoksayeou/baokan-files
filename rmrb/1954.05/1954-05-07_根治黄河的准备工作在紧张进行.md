(Kaifeng, May 5th) With the development of national construction, preparations for radically controlling the Yellow River are progressing victoriously. Over the past few years, the People's Government has carried out tremendous work in terms of Yellow River management, such as levee construction, the Yellow River irrigation project to benefit Ji and Wei, surveying, planning, and design, and water and soil conservation. This has initially avoided major flood disasters and created conditions for fundamental solutions. In order to implement the comprehensive development and management policy of the Yellow River for flood control, power generation, irrigation, and navigation, the focus of this year's Yellow River management is to actively formulate basin plans and conduct planned reconnaissance, drilling, surveying, and research on reservoir site selection in the upper reaches. Correspondingly, vigorous efforts will be made to carry out water and soil conservation work in the Loess Plateau area of the upper reaches, and small reservoirs will be built on tributaries to reduce sediment and flood discharge, ensuring the progress of the entire Yellow River management project. At the same time, before the completion of the above projects, continued efforts will be made to strengthen levee maintenance and flood control work. Currently, Soviet experts and a large number of engineering and technical personnel are working day and night in the upper reaches of the Yellow River to carry out the above preparations. Water and soil conservation work has also entered the stage of large-scale mobilization of the masses to plant trees and afforest, shifting from key experiments. This year's spring levee repair and reinforcement project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River is also progressing well. In the first phase of the project, more than 98,000 laborers in Shandong and Henan provinces completed a total of 3.46 million cubic meters of earthwork. Drilling work is also being actively carried out.

Henan Province used methods such as investigation, visits, and mass reporting to drill more than 643,000 wells and discovered more than 1,000 caves. At the same time, labor efficiency and project quality have also improved compared to the past. For example, the average total earthwork efficiency of the Liaocheng Repair and Defense Office in Shandong reached more than six cubic meters, an increase of 13.6 percent compared to last year. After 3,000 inspections, the ramming project fully met the standards. The average earthwork efficiency in Henan Province is generally above four meters. The Puyang Repair and Defense Office inspected twelve ramming projects, and only one did not fully meet the required standards. Now, the second phase of the Yellow River's spring repair project is about to be successfully completed, and the third phase of the project is being actively carried out in conjunction with flood control preparations.

    根治黄河的准备工作在紧张进行
    【本报开封五日电】随着国家建设的发展，根治黄河的准备工作正在胜利进行中。几年以来，人民政府在治黄方面进行了巨大的工作，如堤防建设、引黄灌溉济卫工程、勘测规划设计及水土保持等，使大的洪水灾害初步得以避免，并为治本创造了条件。为贯彻执行黄河防洪、发电、灌溉、航运综合开发的治理方针，今年的治黄重点是积极制订流域规划，有计划地在上游进行勘察、钻探、测量以及库址的选择研究等工作，并相应地在上游黄土高原地带大力开展水土保持工作和在支流修筑小型水库，以减少泥沙及洪水下泄，保证整个治黄工程的进行。同时在上述工程未完成前，继续加强堤防岁修与防汛工作。现在，苏联专家和大批工程技术人员，正在黄河上游日夜进行上述各项准备工作；水土保持工作也由重点试验进入大规模发动群众植树造林的阶段。黄河下游今年的春季修堤整险工程，也做得很好。山东、河南两省在第一期工程中，九万八千多民工共完成了土方三百四十六万余公方。钻探工作也在积极进行中。
    河南省用调查、访问、群众检举等办法，钻了六十四万三千多眼，发现洞穴一千多个。同时劳动效率和工程质量也都较前提高，如山东聊城修防处土方总平均效率达到六公方以上，比去年提高百分之十三点六。打硪工程，经过三千次检查，完全合乎标准。河南省土方工程，平均效率一般也都在四公尺以上。濮阳修防处检查了十二处打硪工程，仅有一处不完全合规定标准。现在，黄河第二期春修工程就将胜利完成，第三期工程正结合防汛准备工作在积极进行。
