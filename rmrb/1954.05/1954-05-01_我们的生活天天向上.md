    Our Life Gets Better Every Day
    Pu· Muchunnieke, Worker of the "VEF" Electrical Manufacturing Factory, Riga, Soviet Union
    Every day, dozens of cars carrying hundreds of "Peace" and "Baltic" brand radios, manufactured by us workers, leave the factory gates and are distributed to various trade centers along Riga's main street, Lenin Street. Riga's radios are used throughout the country. Whether in Riga or in distant Magadan, people can use it to clearly hear the familiar voice of Moscow. Our factory not only produces radios, but also automatic telephone exchange equipment, switchboards, telephones, and other equipment that enjoy a good reputation. Our output expands year by year, with new workshops being put into use, old workshops being rebuilt, and new products being produced every year.
    The welfare of the workers at the "VEF" Electrical Manufacturing Factory is also growing rapidly. The Party and the government's constant concern for continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people is also clearly reflected in our factory. The real wages of workers and technical staff in our factory increase every year. Millions of rubles are used for social and cultural facilities and residential construction. Like all the Soviet people, the lives of all the staff in our factory are becoming more prosperous and happier; the happier the life, the higher the work efficiency. I have been working as a precision mechanic at the "VEF" Electrical Manufacturing Factory for eight years. Our production team makes bases for "Peace" brand radios. My monthly salary is over two thousand rubles, and with the salaries of my wife and father, our family's income is no less than three thousand five hundred rubles per month, or forty-two thousand rubles per year. There are six people in our family. Two daughters are in school, and my mother takes care of the housework. We live very well and can buy many things every year. Two years ago, I bought a "Moskvich" car. Last year, I bought coats for myself, my wife, and my children, several sets of clothes for my wife and me, and beautiful clothes for my parents and children. In recent years, we have also added some furniture. The "Moskvich" car is no longer enough for the whole family, so we will buy a "Victory" car soon.
    In our country, the prices of food and industrial products are often reduced. The price reduction implemented from April 1st this year has added new income to our family budget. I have calculated that our various expenses will be reduced by about three thousand rubles this year. That is to say, we will live even better and be able to buy more food and industrial products.
    My family's life is not an exception. All my colleagues live very well. It is enough to illustrate this by the following facts: more than two hundred and fifty people in our factory have private cars and motorcycles. Our workshop's fitters, Yang· Rubin and Yang· Midelevsky, often drive their "Moskvich" cars to the outskirts of the city on Sundays for outings. Some workers in our factory traveled to the Caucasus last year in their own cars for long trips. Precision mechanic Arnold· Anderson is building his private house. He recently received a bonus of twenty thousand rubles for proposing a rationalization suggestion. The cultural level of the workers at the "VEF" factory is also constantly improving. Now, more than three thousand five hundred people are participating in technical training groups, youth worker schools, secondary technical schools, and night classes at the Latvian State University.
    The "VEF" factory is building Riga's largest cultural palace. A new kindergarten will also be opened this year. The construction of new buildings for the factory clinic and hospital has also begun. Dozens of workers have received state assistance and are building their private houses according to their own interests and wishes.
    My father is an old carpenter. He often talked at home about the miserable life in Latvia under bourgeois rule. The work of construction workers was seasonal. There was only work in the summer, and often there was no work because there were few construction projects. Unemployment became commonplace for those workers who sold their labor cheaply. But now it is completely different. Everyone does their best and is paid according to their work. Huge construction projects are everywhere, and the labor of construction workers is glorious and respected.
    Our life gets better every day. We Soviet workers clearly recognize that the main and decisive condition for further developing the national economy and improving the people's welfare is to maximize labor productivity in all sectors of industry, transportation, construction, and agriculture. Our highly productive labor enables us to rapidly produce large quantities of food and industrial products for the country. All the workers in our workshop participated in the labor competition to greet "May Day" and decided to increase labor productivity by 3% above the original plan in April and complete 105% of the monthly plan. We vow to spare no effort and labor to victoriously realize the tasks set by the Party and the government.

    我们的生活天天向上
    苏联里加“威夫”电器制造工厂工人  普·慕钦涅克
    每天总有数十辆汽车载着由我们工人亲手制造出来的数百架“和平”和“波罗的海”牌无线电收音机驶出工厂的大门，沿着里加城的主要街道——列宁街，把它们分送到各个贸易中心去。全国各地都使用着里加出品的无线电收音机。无论在里加或在遥远的马加丹，人们都能用它同样清楚地收听亲切的莫斯科的声音。我们的工厂不仅出产无线电收音机，我们出产的自动电话站设备、接线机、电话机和其他设备也都享有良好的声誉。我们的产量年年扩大，每年都要启用新的车间、重建旧的车间和出产新的产品。
    “威夫”电器制造工厂工人的福利也在迅速地增长着。党和政府对于不断提高苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平的经常关怀，也明显地表现在我们的工厂里。我们厂里的工人和技术工作人员的实际工资每年都有提高。数百万卢布用于社会文化设施和住宅建筑。像全体苏联人民一样，我们工厂全体人员的生活是愈来愈富裕和愉快的；生活越愉快，工作效率也就越高。我在“威夫”电器制造工厂当精密机械工人已经八年了。我们的生产组是为“和平”牌收音机制作底座的。我每月的工资在两千卢布以上，再加上我妻子和父亲的工资，我们全家的收入每月就不下于三千五百个卢布，一年有四万二千个卢布。我们一家共有六口人。两个女儿在上学，母亲则料理家务。我们生活得很富裕，每年可以添置许多东西。两年以前我买了一辆“莫斯科人”牌的小汽车。去年我为自己、我的妻子和孩子们添置了大衣，为妻子和我买了几套衣服，还为双亲和孩子们买了漂亮的衣服。最近几年来我们还添置了一些家具。“莫斯科人”小汽车已经不够全家用了，所以最近我们就要买一辆“胜利”牌小汽车。
    在我国，食品和工业品的价格常常减低。从今年四月一日起实行的减价又给我们家庭的预算增加了新的收入。我已经算了一下，今年我们的各项开销将要节省约三千卢布。也就是说，我们将生活得更加美好，能够买更多的食品和工业品。
    我家的生活并不是例外的。所有我的同伴们都生活得很富裕。只要举出下面的事实就足够说明这一点了：我们厂里有二百五十多人有私人小汽车和摩托车。我们车间的钳工扬·鲁宾和扬·密得列夫斯基常常在星期天坐着自己的“莫斯科人”汽车到城外去游玩。我们厂里有些工人在去年曾坐了自己的汽车到高加索作长途旅行。精密机械工人阿诺尔德·安德逊正在建筑他的私人住宅。他在不久以前因提出了合理化建议而得到两万卢布的奖金。“威夫”工厂工人的文化水平也在不断地提高。现在有三千五百多人参加了技术进修小组，参加了青年工人学校、中等技术学校和拉脱维亚国立大学的夜班学习。
    “威夫”工厂正在建造一座里加最大的文化宫。今年还要再开办一所新的幼儿园。工厂诊疗所和医院的新楼的建筑工程也已开始。数十个工人得到了国家的帮助，正在按着自己的兴趣和愿望来建造自己的私人住宅。
    我的父亲是个老木工。他常常在家里谈起从前在资产阶级统治下的拉脱维亚的悲惨生活。建筑工人的工作是有季节性的。只有在夏天才有活干，而且还往往因为建筑工程少，而找不到工作。失业成了那些廉价出卖自己劳力的工人们的家常便饭。但现在是完全不同了。每一个人都各尽其能和按劳取酬。巨大的建筑工程到处都有，建筑工人的劳动是光荣的和受人尊敬的。
    我们的生活天天向上。我们苏联工人认识得很清楚：进一步发展国民经济和增进人民福利的主要的、决定性条件，是在工业、运输业、建筑业和农业的一切部门中尽量提高劳动生产率。我们的具有高度生产率的劳动，使我们能够为国家迅速地生产大量食品和工业品。我们车间全体工人都参加了迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛，决定要在四月份内比原定计划提高劳动生产率百分之三，并完成月度计划的百分之一百零五。我们发誓不惜任何力量和劳动来胜利地实现党和政府所规定的任务。
