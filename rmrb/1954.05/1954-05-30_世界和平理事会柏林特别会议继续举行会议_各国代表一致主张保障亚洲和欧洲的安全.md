Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 29th: According to TASS, Berlin, May 28th: At the afternoon session on May 27th of the World Peace Council's special session in Berlin, all speakers addressed the issues of European security and Asian security.

Madame Dumont, a member of the French Republic Senate, said that to guarantee France's security, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the "European Defense Community" and stop the war in Indochina. She said that achieving peace in Indochina only requires sincerity from the French government, as the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has shown their genuine desire for peace.

She emphasized that the French people also desire peace, but the French people's desire for peace has not yet become French policy.

Bauer (representative from Munich, West Germany) pointed out that the "European Defense Community" is a major obstacle on the road to establishing a genuine security system for all countries, including Germany.

Dr. Sliman, Chairman of the Tunisian Committee for Freedom and Peace, and Hassani Tahir Charouk, a member of the Sudanese Parliament, both stated in their speeches that establishing peaceful and equal relations between all peoples is the most important condition for guaranteeing peace in Asia and the world. Charouk said that only peace can enable the people of Asia and Africa to improve their currently extremely low living standards.

Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet spoke about Turkey's role in American military plans and in American conspiracies to undermine peace in the Near East.

Professor Ibrahim Rachad, Chairman of the Egyptian National Committee for the Defense of Peace, assured the conference that the forces of war cannot make the freedom-loving Egyptian people participate in any aggressive blocs or alliances.

Virgilio Grah, Secretary of the Guatemalan Workers' Confederation, used his own country as an example to illustrate that the US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of small countries and infringing on their independence has created tension in the international situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 29th: According to TASS, Berlin, May 28th: The morning session on May 28th of the World Peace Council's special session in Berlin was chaired by Mukarovsky of Czechoslovakia and continued to discuss international security issues.

Jacques Nuum, Secretary-General of the Cameroon Trade Union Confederation, said that for the people of Black Africa, the issue of guaranteeing security is closely linked to the struggle for freedom and national independence. He said that when African people demand peace, freedom, and independence for themselves, they are supporting the following demands: implementing a ceasefire in Indochina; peacefully resolving the Korean issue; unifying Germany on the basis of democracy and peace; and restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Ali Bomantejer (Algeria) called on world public opinion to oppose the conscription of Africans into the French Foreign Legion to suppress the freedom of the Vietnamese people.

Onkar Nath Thakur, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and Principal of the Music Academy, said that cultural exchanges must be promoted as an important condition for strengthening friendly and mutually respectful relations between countries.

Makoto Hori, a member of the Japanese Diet, supported the demand for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and a cessation of the war in Indochina, and suggested promoting direct negotiations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France. He suggested that the resolution of the World Peace Council should reflect these demands: ending foreign occupation and the establishment of military bases on the territories of Asian countries, and restoring the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. He expressed the hope that a collective security system including all Asian countries could be established, and he suggested convening a representative conference of Asian peoples aimed at easing tensions in Asia. He suggested expanding economic relations between East and West on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Speakers at the morning session also included Mrs. Ruth Pfister (South Africa), Abdel Kader Salen (Outer Jordan), Mohamed Kamel Bindari of Egypt, Charles Elernot, Chairman of the Jacobin Club (France), Puvilos, Mayor of Famagusta (Cyprus), and others.
