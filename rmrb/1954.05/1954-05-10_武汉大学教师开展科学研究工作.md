    Wuhan University teachers are closely integrating teaching with scientific research. Mathematics Department teachers are currently focusing on studying Soviet works on function theory, with some teachers conducting specialized research on "Complex Functions." The General Physics Teaching Research Group, the Optics Teaching Group, the Electrical Engineering Teaching Group, and the Theoretical Mechanics Teaching Group of the Physics Department have organized twenty-four discussions on teaching issues this semester. During the discussions, the Electrical Engineering Teaching Group helped individual teachers improve their understanding of Soviet textbooks. The Ancient and Medieval Chinese History Teaching Group of the History Department has had teachers Tan Jiefu and Tang Changru give specialized reports on "Mozi" and the social economy of the Southern Dynasties, respectively, which have solved practical problems for many young teachers in teaching Chinese history courses. Before the summer vacation, this teaching group plans to organize two more specialized reports.

    This semester, teachers across the university have compiled eighty-five kinds of teaching materials. Liu Yongji, a teacher in the Chinese Department, has written "Notes on Understanding the Meaning of Chu Ci," incorporating his research on Qu Yuan's works, supplementing and enriching his original work "Comprehensive Commentary on Chu Ci." Other teachers have selected and annotated certain parts of Han Dynasty Yuefu poetry, the Book of Songs, and prose from various dynasties. Li Guoping, a teacher in the Mathematics Department, has completed an important mathematical paper "Theory of Cluster Sets," commissioned by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is currently writing a manuscript on "Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations," which he plans to present at a lecture organized by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government this summer.

    Wuhan University has received more research assignments from enterprises and production departments than in the past. Recently, Hankou Union Hospital commissioned Wuhan University to examine the properties of radium needles used for laboratory diagnosis. After careful examination and research by the Modern Physics Laboratory of the Physics Department, some affirmative conclusions have been reached. The Analytical Chemistry Laboratory of the Chemistry Department has also assisted the Central China Iron and Steel Company in analyzing the composition of newly discovered mineral samples.

    To improve the level of scientific research, many teachers at Wuhan University are actively strengthening their study of Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works. Cheng Qianfan, a teacher in the Chinese Department, is currently writing study notes on Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to accompany the teaching of the "Selected Readings in Theoretical Criticism" course. Three teaching groups in the History Department are conducting theoretical studies closely related to their teaching. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武汉大学教师开展科学研究工作
    武汉大学许多教师正密切结合教学进行科学研究工作。数学系教师现正着重研究苏联有关函数论的著作，部分教师并开展了关于“复变函数”的专题研究。物理系普通物理教研组、光学教学小组、电学教学小组和理论力学教学小组这学期已组织了二十四次有关教学问题的讨论。电学教学小组在讨论中，帮助个别教师提高了对苏联教材的认识。历史系中国上古及中古史教学小组这学期已由谭戒甫、唐长孺教师分别作了关于“墨子”和南朝社会经济的专题报告，这些报告解决了许多年青教师在讲授中国史课程中的实际问题。暑假以前，这个教学小组还准备组织两个专题报告。
    在这一学期，全校教师已先后编写了八十五种讲义。中文系教师刘永济把研究屈赋的心得写成“笺屈余义”，补充并丰富了他的原著“屈赋通笺”；其他教师已分别对汉乐府诗、诗经、历代散文的某些部分加以评选和注释。数学系教师李国平已写好中国科学院所委托的重要的数学论文“聚值线理论”。并正在撰写关于“常微分方程式论”的讲稿，准备今年暑假在中央人民政府高等教育部举办的讲座上报告。
    武汉大学接受企业生产部门的委托进行的研究工作比过去增多。最近，汉口协和医院曾委托武汉大学检验诊病用的镭锭的性质，经过物理系近代物理实验室仔细的检验和研究，已有一部分作出肯定的结论。化学系分析化学实验室也曾帮助华中钢铁公司对新发现的矿样成分进行分析。
    为了提高科学研究水平，武汉大学许多教师正积极加强关于马克思列宁主义理论、毛泽东著作的学习。中文系教师程千帆为配合讲授“理论批评文选”课程，现正在写学习毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的读书笔记。历史系三个教学小组正在进行和自己教学有密切关系的理论学习。                         （新华社）
