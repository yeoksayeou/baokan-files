    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th—In Gansu Province, approximately 300,000 farmers are studying agricultural techniques during the spring plowing season. Before this year's spring plowing, the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, in addition to strengthening existing agricultural technology extension stations (formerly known as agricultural work stations), established eleven more agricultural technology extension stations in counties such as the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region, Minqin, and Linze. Each agricultural technology extension station dispatched cadres, who, under the leadership of the local people's government, held agricultural technology training classes focusing on the use of new farm tools, pest and disease control, soil and water conservation, seed selection, and fertilization. Participants included district and township cadres, agricultural production cooperative chairpersons, mutual aid team leaders, and labor models, who then actively taught local farmers. As a result, farmers in various regions have increased their interest and enthusiasm for improving farming techniques. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3.7 million mu of spring wheat throughout the province have been treated with seed dressing. In Dingxin County, spring wheat and other summer crops are almost entirely planted in rows. In Zhangye County, the area of spring wheat planted in rows accounts for more than 87% of the total sown area; the county exchanged more than 70 methods for preventing and controlling livestock diseases. In Liangjiang Township, Gangu County, Dongguan Hui Autonomous Township, Huixian County, and Pingluo, Zhangping, and Zhongzhai Townships, Kangxian County, some wheat fields were infested with red spiders. Farmers immediately used pesticides and other methods for control, eliminating the pests and restoring wheat growth. In addition, the promotion of new farm tools in various regions has greatly increased compared to previous years.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th—The six irrigation and river defense projects planned for construction in minority areas in Gansu Province this year commenced in April and are scheduled for completion in July. These projects include the Xin'nong Canal in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region, the Chengyang Canal in the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, and the Huangcitan River Defense Project in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region. Upon completion, these six projects will convert more than 11,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land and create more than 2,000 mu of silted land, increasing grain production by more than 1.3 million jin annually. Among them, the A Hong Zhuang river defense project in Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region and the Huangcitan river defense project in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region can protect nearly a hundred Tibetan, Hui, and Han households on both banks of the Tao River and Daxia River from flood disasters.
    Water conservancy conditions in minority areas of Gansu Province are relatively poor. Over the past two years, people's governments at all levels have actively led the masses in finding water sources and building small canals, expanding the irrigated area by more than 33,000 mu. Last autumn, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent technicians to Xihai Gu and other places to conduct survey and design work, preparing conditions for further development of water conservancy. This year, in addition to investing in the construction of important projects, the People's Government is mobilizing farmers of all ethnic groups to actively build small-scale water conservancy projects.

    甘肃三十多万农民春耕中学习了农业技术
    在少数民族地区兴修的六项水利工程已动工
    【新华社兰州十六日电】甘肃省各地在春耕期间，约有农民三十多万人学习了农业技术。甘肃省人民政府农林厅在今年春耕前，除加强原有的农业技术推广站（原名农业工作站）外，又在西海固回族自治区、广通回族自治区、民勤、临泽等县成立了十一个农业技术推广站。各农业技术推广站都派出干部，在当地人民政府领导下，分别举办了以使用新式农具、防治病虫害、水土保持、选种、施肥等为内容的农业技术训练班。各地参加学习的有区乡干部、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长、劳动模范等，他们回去后又积极向当地农民进行传授。因此，各地农民都提高了改进耕作技术的兴趣和积极性。据不完全统计，全省有三百七十多万亩春小麦经过药剂拌种。鼎新县春小麦等夏田作物几乎全部是条播的。张掖县春小麦条播的面积已占播种总面积百分之八十七以上；全县交流防治牲畜疾病的方法达七十多条。甘谷县亮江乡、徽县东关回族自治乡以及康县的平洛、张坪、中寨等乡部分麦田内发生红蜘蛛后，农民立即用药剂等防治，使虫害全部消灭，麦苗恢复生长。此外，各地推广的新式农具也比往年大大增多。
    【新华社兰州十六日电】甘肃省今年计划在少数民族地区兴修的六项灌溉和河防工程，已在四月份先后动工，计划在七月份完成。这些工程包括东乡族自治区的新农渠，西海固回族自治区的城阳渠，甘南藏族自治区的黄茨滩河防工程等。这六项工程完成后，将使一万一千多亩旱地变为水地，并可淤地二千多亩，每年能增产粮食一百三十多万斤。其中广通回族自治区阿訇庄和甘南藏族自治区黄茨滩两河防工程完成后，可以保护洮河和大夏河两岸近百户藏、回、汉族人民免遭洪水灾害。
    甘肃省少数民族地区水利条件比较差，两年来各级人民政府积极领导群众找寻水源，兴修小型渠道，已扩大灌溉面积三万三千多亩。去年秋季，省人民政府农林厅水利局又派技术人员在西海固等地进行勘测设计工作，为进一步发展水利准备了条件。今年人民政府除投资兴修重要工程外，并发动各族农民积极兴修小型水利。
