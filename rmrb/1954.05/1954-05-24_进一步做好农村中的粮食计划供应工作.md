    Further Improve the Planned Supply of Grain in Rural Areas
  　Kang Weizhong
    Today, this newspaper publishes the experiences of Houtun Township in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, and Shangzhuang Township in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, in correctly implementing the state's grain policy and doing a good job in the planned supply of grain in rural areas. They provide better methods for doing a good job in the planned supply of grain in rural areas, which are worth referring to and imitating in various places.
    Judging from the experience of Houtun Township, the primary key to doing a good job in the planned supply of grain in rural areas is to strengthen the education of the Party organizations and rural cadres in the state's grain policy. Party organizations and rural cadres in rural areas are the leaders and organizers in implementing the various policies of the Party and the People's Government in rural areas, and they are also the leaders and organizers in implementing the grain planned supply policy. If they are not made to fully understand the state's grain policy and the relationship between the state's planned purchase of grain and the planned supply of grain, and thus actively do a good job in the planned supply of grain, the state's grain policy cannot be realized and correctly implemented in the vast rural areas. In the past, some rural district and township cadres did not pay attention to the planned supply of grain in rural areas, and their understanding of the objects and standards of the planned supply of grain was also vague. Some cadres mistakenly believed that "unified purchase is a task, and unified sales is not a task," or "unified sales is easy and unified purchase is difficult," "farmers need to be educated to sell grain, but there is no need to mobilize them to buy grain"; some even misunderstood unified sales as "whoever comes to buy, sell to whoever comes, and give as much as they buy." Therefore, they either ignored the planned supply of grain, let it go, or only purchased but did not sell, clamping down too tightly. The village cadres of Lijiazhuang in Leting County, Hebei Province, wrote purchase introduction letters for seventy-five farmers in one day, of which only fourteen were found to be actually short of grain. In contrast, in Bajiqu District of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, some villages established "welfare groups" to control the grain supply for grain-deficient households. The masses had to have all seven members of the committee stamp and sign the application for grain purchase before they could buy grain. The masses reflected that the "welfare group" had become a "disadvantageous group." These practices either increased the state's burden of supplying grain or increased the inconvenience to farmers, causing dissatisfaction among farmers. These situations show that whether district and township cadres have a correct understanding of the planned supply of grain is closely related to whether the planned supply of grain can be carried out smoothly. In the process of carrying out the planned supply of grain, Houtun Township in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, overcame various misunderstandings about the planned supply of grain through the enlarged meeting of the township and village Party branches of the Communist Party of China, so that the Party members in the township and village not only attached importance to the planned purchase of grain, but also attached importance to the planned supply of grain at the same time. Some cadres said: "In the past, we only managed unified purchase and did not manage unified sales, which is like walking on one leg." Some said: "If unified sales are not done well, unified purchase will be in vain." Therefore, they all consciously reviewed and criticized various misunderstandings about the planned supply of grain, and expressed one after another: "We will resolutely do a good job in unified sales and be a good housekeeper for the whole township." Therefore, learning from this experience is of great significance to our work in the planned supply of grain in rural areas.
    The experiences of the two townships also tell us that to do a good job in the planned supply of grain in rural areas, we must continue to deeply publicize the state's grain policy and the relationship between planned purchase and planned supply of grain to the broad masses of peasants. At present, some cadres believe that it has been publicized in the past, so there is no need to publicize it again now, and some cadres have no confidence in doing a good job in the planned supply of grain and dare not let the state's grain planned supply policy meet the masses. Obviously, this kind of thinking and practice are both wrong. They did not deeply realize that the planned supply of grain, like the planned purchase of grain, is a major event related to the vital interests of the broad masses of peasants. If it is not publicized to the peasants and their active support is not obtained, it is impossible to smoothly carry out the planned supply of grain. At present, we should continue to publicize to the masses with surplus grain that selling surplus grain to the state to support national construction is glorious and beneficial to both the state and themselves. Explain to the grain-deficient households that the state's implementation of the planned supply of grain is to ensure that the grain-deficient households can buy the actual needs of grain at a reasonable price. But if they already have enough grain to eat or have purchased the necessary grain in the rural primary market, there is no need for the state to supply it; careful calculation and saving grain for the country is also a manifestation of patriotism. Explain to the households that need to be adjusted that the state resolutely bans the speculative activities of grain merchants and grain dealers, but the adjustment of surplus and deficiency between the masses is allowed. At the same time, we should also deeply carry out education on increasing production and saving, so as to save money, accumulate funds, and expand production. Houtun Township in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, continued to deeply implement the general line education, publicized the state's grain policy, and educated the peasants with the example of the benefits of the township's planned purchase of grain to the state and the peasants, thus further improving the political consciousness of the peasants, eliminating concerns, and actively supporting the state's grain policy. The peasants generally reflected: "If there is water in the big river, the small river will not dry up. Only when the state controls the grain can we have a good life." "If the planned supply is not implemented, whoever has money will sell to whoever has money. As a result, the grain is bought by the profiteers, and the farmers still suffer." Some peasants with surplus grain continued to sell surplus grain, and those who were not short of grain or were short of very little also proposed to practice strict economy and not buy grain.
    In order to further improve the planned supply of grain in rural areas, it is also very necessary to strengthen the investigation and research on the surplus and deficiency of grain in rural areas. Due to the complex economic situation in rural China, the current surplus and deficiency of grain and the degree of grain deficiency among farmers in various places are different. For example, in terms of regions, China is divided into fishing, salt, forest, animal husbandry, economic crop areas, disaster areas, mountainous areas, plains, and market towns and scattered rural areas; in terms of the time of farmers' grain shortage, there are those who are short of one month, those who are short of several months, and those who are short of half a year or the whole year. Moreover, the economic income of the broad masses of peasants is seasonal, and consumption needs also have great flexibility with the different seasons. These situations are objective difficulties in carrying out the planned supply of grain in rural areas. In order to overcome these difficulties, the local grain departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, especially the district and township people's governments, should closely rely on the masses and carry out in-depth and meticulous investigation of grain in rural areas. Only by doing a good job in the investigation of grain in rural areas can we guarantee the necessary grain supply for the truly grain-deficient households in rural areas, appropriately control sales volume, and prevent grain speculation and hoarding. After investigation and research, and under the supervision of the masses, Houtun Township in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, made the final determined number of grain-deficient households close to the actual number. For example, Xintun Village initially investigated 23 grain-deficient households with a total of 4,000 jin of grain; the second investigation showed that there were 18 grain-deficient households with a total of 2,700 jin of grain; the third investigation reduced to 17 households with a total of 2,460 jin of grain. According to the investigation results, the grain needs of the grain-deficient households were supplied, and 13 chronically difficult households were provided with relief. Basically, it achieved accurate supply and mass satisfaction. At the same time, on the basis of investigating the surplus and deficiency of grain, state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives can further appropriately solve the grain needs of flour mills, noodle shops, small restaurants, and mule and horse inns in rural areas and towns according to actual needs. It is beneficial to invigorate the urban and rural economy to solve the grain needs of urban and rural mobile personnel on transportation arteries and the production of rural non-staple foods.
    Establishing a grain market controlled by the state without the participation of private merchants in rural areas, and organizing farmers to adjust the surplus and deficiency and varieties of grain between each other is an important measure to assist planned supply. This is not only suitable for the current rural economic situation, farmers' habits, and convenience of the masses in our country, but also can reduce the state's losses in transportation, storage, and funds in the grain management process, and reduce the state's burden. Especially at present, when the state does not have enough power to prepare enough grain varieties for the consumption requirements of the masses in various regions, organizing farmers to adjust grain to each other is beneficial to both farmers and the state.
    At present, it is the time when there is a shortage of grain in rural areas, and it is also the season when rural production enters a tense period. Doing a good job in the planned supply of grain in rural areas is related to the production and life of farmers, and will also have a great impact on this year's planned purchase of grain. Party committees and government departments at all levels must seize the opportunity, grasp the key points of local grain supply, conduct inspections, discover problems, and solve them in time, so as to improve the planned supply of grain in rural areas on the existing basis.

### 进一步做好农村中的粮食计划供应工作

    进一步做好农村中的粮食计划供应工作
  　康伟中
    今天本报登载了山东省胶县后屯乡和山西省太谷县上庄乡正确贯彻国家粮食政策，做好农村粮食计划供应工作的经验。它们为做好农村粮食计划供应工作，提供了较好的方法，值得各地参考仿效。
    从后屯乡的经验来看，做好农村粮食计划供应工作的首要关键，是对乡村党的组织和乡村干部加强国家粮食政策的教育。农村中的党组织和乡村干部，是在农村中贯彻党和人民政府各项政策的领导者和组织者，也是贯彻粮食计划供应政策的领导者和组织者，如果不使他们完整地认识国家的粮食政策，认识国家粮食计划收购与粮食计划供应的关系，从而积极地作好粮食计划供应工作，国家的粮食政策在广大农村就无法实现和正确地贯彻。过去，有些农村区乡干部对农村粮食计划供应工作是不重视的，对粮食计划供应的对象、标准认识也是模糊的。有些干部错误认为“统购是任务，统销不是任务”，或者“统销容易统购难”，“农民卖粮要教育，买粮不用动员”；还有把统销误解为“谁来买就卖给谁，买多少给多少”。因而他们对粮食计划供应工作不是不管不问、放任自流，就是只购不销、卡得过紧。河北省乐亭县李家庄的村干部，在一天中就给七十五户农民写了购粮介绍信，其中经查明实际缺粮的仅有十四户。与此相反，江苏泗阳县八集区，有的村成立“福利小组”，掌握缺粮户的粮食供应，群众申请购粮，须经过七个委员全部盖章签字证明，才能买到粮食，群众反映“福利小组”成了“不利小组”。这些做法，不是加重了国家供应粮食的负担，就是增加了农民的不便，引起农民的不满。这些情况说明：区乡干部对粮食计划供应工作有无正确认识，与粮食计划供应工作的能不能顺利进行，有着密切关系。山东省胶县后屯乡在进行粮食计划供应工作中，通过中国共产党乡、村支委扩大会议，克服了对粮食计划供应工作的各种错误认识，使乡、村中的党员不仅重视了粮食计划收购工作，而且同时重视了粮食计划供应工作。有的干部说：“过去光管统购，不管统销，就像一条腿走路”，有的说：“统销搞不好，统购白拉倒。”因之，都自觉地检讨和批判了对粮食计划工作的各种错误认识，纷纷表示：“坚决作好统销工作，当好全乡的家。”因而学习这个经验对我们作好农村粮食计划供应工作有很重要的意义。
    两乡的经验还告诉我们，要做好农村粮食计划供应工作，还必须继续向广大农民深入地宣传国家的粮食政策，宣传粮食计划收购与计划供应的关系。目前有些干部，认为过去已宣传过了，现在就不必再宣传了，还有些干部对做好粮食计划供应工作没有信心，不敢把国家的粮食计划供应政策和群众见面。显然的，这种想法和做法都是不对的。他们没有深切认识到粮食计划供应和计划收购一样，是一件关系到广大农民切身利益的大事，如果不向农民宣传，并得到他们的积极拥护，要使粮食计划供应工作顺利进行是不可能的。目前我们应当继续对有余粮的群众宣传，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设，功在国家，利在自己，是光荣的。向缺粮户讲明：国家实行粮食计划供应，就是保障缺粮户可以按合理的价格买到实需的粮食。但如果自己已有够吃的粮食或在农村初级市场上已经购得必要的粮食，就不必再由国家供应；精打细算，为国家节约粮食，同样是爱国的表现。对需要调剂的户讲明：国家坚决取缔粮商粮贩的投机活动，但对群众之间的有无调剂是允许的。同时还应深入进行增产节约的教育，以便省吃俭用，积累资金，扩大生产。山东省胶县后屯乡继续深入贯彻了总路线教育，宣传了国家的粮食政策，并以本乡粮食计划收购对国家对农民所得的好处的实例，向农民进行教育，因而就进一步提高了农民的政治觉悟，消除了顾虑，积极拥护国家的粮食政策。农民普遍反映：“大河里有水，小河里不干，只有国家掌握了粮食，咱才有好日子过”，“如果不实行计划供应，谁有钱就卖给谁，结果粮食都叫奸商买去了，吃亏的还是农民”。还有余粮的农民继续卖出了余粮，不缺粮或缺粮很少的，也提出厉行节约，不买粮食。
    为进一步做好农村粮食计划供应工作，加强调查研究农村余粮缺粮工作也是十分必要的。由于我国农村经济情况复杂，各地农民目前粮食余、缺情况和缺粮程度各不相同。如以地区来说，我国有渔、盐、林、牧、经济作物区、灾区和山区、平原以及集镇与分散农村之分；如从农民缺粮的时间来分，有缺一个月的、有缺几个月的，有缺半年或全年的。而且广大农民的经济收入是有季节性的，消费需要也随着季节的不同有着极大的伸缩性。这些情况都是进行农村粮食计划供应工作的客观困难。为要克服这些困难，各地粮食部门、供销合作社，特别是区乡人民政府，应密切依靠群众，进行深入的、细致的农村粮食的调查工作。只有作好农村粮食调查工作，才能保证农村真正缺粮户所必需的粮食供应，适当控制销量，防止粮食投机和囤积行为。山东省胶县后屯乡经过调查研究，并在群众的监督下，使最后所确定的缺粮数字接近于实际，如辛屯村第一次调查缺粮户有二十三户，共四千斤粮；第二次调查结果，缺粮户十八户，共二千七百斤粮；第三次调查结果减至十七户，共二千四百六十斤粮，根据调查结果，供应了缺粮户的粮食需要，并对十三户常年困难户进行了救济。基本上做到了供应准确，群众满意。同时，在调查了粮食余缺情况的基础上，国营粮食部门和供销合作社，就可以进一步根据实际需要，适当解决农村和城镇中的粉坊、面食店、小饭馆和骡马客店的粮食需要。以解决城乡流动人员在交通要道上的粮食需要和农村副食品生产问题，有利于活跃城乡经济。
    在农村建立由国家控制的没有私商参加的粮食市场，和组织农民进行相互间的粮食余缺和品种调剂是协助计划供应的一项重要措施。这不但适合我国目前农村经济情况、农民习惯与便利群众，而且还可以减少国家在粮食经营过程中运输、保管、资金等损失，减轻国家负担。尤其在目前国家还没有足够力量来备足各个不同区域群众的各种不同粮种消费要求的条件下，组织农民互相调剂粮食，对农民与对国家都是有利的。
    目前正是历来农村青黄不接缺粮时期，也是农村生产进入紧张的季节，作好农村粮食计划供应工作，关系到农民的生产和生活，对今年粮食计划收购工作也将有很大影响。各级党委和政府部门必须抓紧时机，抓住当地粮食供应重点，进行检查，发现问题，及时解决，以便把农村粮食计划供应工作在现有基础上提高一步。
