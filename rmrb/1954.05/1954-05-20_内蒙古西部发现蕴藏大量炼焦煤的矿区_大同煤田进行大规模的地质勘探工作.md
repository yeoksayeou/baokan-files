Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th. A coal mining area with large reserves of coking coal has been discovered in the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This mining area faces the Yellow River and is very close to Baotou. It will become a promising source of coking coal for China's steel industry.

    A prospecting team from the North China Geological Bureau, responsible for prospecting this mining area, arrived in the mining area in March this year. Encouraged by their enthusiasm for building the motherland, they personally set up mat sheds and yurts as dormitories. In just two months, braving the sand and gravel blown by the desert, they carried out a total of seventy li of trench prospecting, one hundred and twenty shallow well prospecting, and five tunnel prospecting. The team members responsible for transportation drove trucks and animal-drawn carts loaded with equipment on bumpy and uneven roads with many sandy areas as early as two months ago. In order to transport the equipment to the mining area in time, they repeatedly carried the equipment through the desert area and then loaded it onto vehicles to move forward. Now, large-scale detailed survey work and the first batch of drilling projects in this mining area have begun. Many measuring signal flags have been erected near the mining area. In order to supply water for the drilling rigs, the exploration team has built a water transportation road from the mining area to the Yellow River embankment.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th. Thousands of geological exploration personnel are conducting large-scale geological exploration work in the Datong Coalfield. They will submit all design data for two pairs of large-scale new vertical shafts within this year, and will continue to submit design data for three to five pairs of new shafts next year. In order to support the geological exploration work in the Datong Coalfield, the North China Coal Mine Administration and other units have specially dispatched seven survey teams and a large number of geological personnel. Hundreds of management cadres, skilled workers, and a large number of drilling rigs transferred from the Yangquan Mining Bureau and other units have also begun to converge on Datong.

    The drilling workers working hard in the high mountains and deep valleys have drilled thousands of meters from January to April due to the conscientious implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the drilling quality has exceeded the standards stipulated by the state. The Jiang Yu team drilled more than 300 meters in April, exceeding the national plan by more than one time. They are working hard to carry out a drilling task that is nearly twice as large as last year. The geological personnel have also broken the past practice of analyzing data only after completing all drilling tasks, and adopted parallel operations of analyzing data along with drilling, which greatly improved work efficiency.

    The Datong Coalfield is one of the coalfields with the largest reserves in China. The mines currently being developed only account for a small part of the entire coalfield. In particular, the geological structure of the Datong Coalfield is simple, there is very little gas, the roof and floor of the coal seam are firm, the coal quality is very good, and it is also the intersection of the Beijing-Baotou Railway and the Tongpu Railway. The mining conditions and transportation conditions are quite superior. The state's investment in building a new mine with the same output in the Datong Coalfield can be saved compared to other general coal mines.

### 内蒙古西部发现蕴藏大量炼焦煤的矿区  大同煤田进行大规模的地质勘探工作

    内蒙古西部发现蕴藏大量炼焦煤的矿区
    大同煤田进行大规模的地质勘探工作
    【新华社呼和浩特十九日电】内蒙古自治区西部发现了一个蕴藏有大量炼焦煤的煤矿区。这个矿区面临黄河，离包头市很近。它将成为我国钢铁工业一个很有希望的炼焦煤供应地。
    负责勘探这个矿区的华北地质局的一支勘探队，在今年三月到达矿区。他们在建设祖国的热情鼓舞下，亲自搭起了席棚和蒙古包作为宿舍，并且在短短的两个月内，冒着沙漠上刮来的砂石，进行了总长七十里的槽探、一百二十个浅井探和五个洞探。担任运输工作的队员们，早在两个多月以前就驾驶着满载器材的汽车和兽力车，行进在颠簸不平和中间有许多沙地的公路上。为了及时把器材运送到矿区，他们还多次地扛着器材通过沙漠地带，然后再装车前进。现在，这个矿区的大规模的详查工作和第一批钻探工程已经开始。矿区附近已竖立起许多测量用的信号旗。勘探队员们为了供应钻机用水，特从矿区到黄河河沿修筑了一条运水公路。
    【新华社太原十八日电】成千个地质勘探人员们正在大同煤田上进行着大规模的地质勘探工作。他们要在今年内提出两对规模宏大的新竖井的全部设计资料，明年还将继续提出三对到五对新井的设计资料。为了支援大同煤田的地质勘探工作，华北煤矿管理局等单位特抽调来了七个测量队和大批地质人员。阳泉矿务局等单位调来的几百个管理干部、技术工人和大批钻机等，也已开始向大同集中。
    在高山深谷中紧张工作着的钻探工人们，由于认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，一月份到四月份已经钻进了几千公尺，钻探质量超过了国家规定的标准。姜玉小组四月份钻进三百多公尺，超过国家计划一倍多。他们正在努力地执行着比去年将近大一倍的钻探任务。地质人员们也打破过去完成全部钻探任务以后才进行资料分析的惯例，采取随钻探随分析的平行作业，使得工作效率大大提高。
    大同煤田是我国蕴藏量最大的煤田之一，目前正在开发的各矿，只占整个煤田的很小一部分。特别是大同煤田地质构造简单，瓦斯很少，煤层顶底板坚固，煤质很好，又是京包铁路和同蒲铁路的交点，开采条件和交通条件都相当优越。在大同煤田建设一对同等产量的新矿井，国家的投资可以比在其他一般煤矿节省。
