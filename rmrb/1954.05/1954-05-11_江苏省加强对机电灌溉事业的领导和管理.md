Jiangsu Province Strengthens Leadership and Management of Electromechanical Irrigation

The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Department recently held the first electromechanical irrigation work conference of 1954, deciding to further strengthen the leadership and management of electromechanical irrigation, and to fully exert the effectiveness of electromechanical irrigation equipment.

The electromechanical irrigation industry in the province is relatively developed. The province currently has 207 state-owned, private and farmer-run electric irrigation stations with a total of more than 10,000 horsepower, irrigating more than 520,000 mu of farmland. There are more than 4,200 pumping stations owned by the state, private individuals, and farmers themselves, with more than 70,000 horsepower, irrigating more than 3 million mu of farmland.

The meeting believed that in future work, it is necessary to pay attention to and strengthen the leadership of state-owned pumping stations; strengthen guidance to farmer-run mechanical irrigation, assist them in establishing organizations, implementing democratic management, and reasonably sharing water fees. It is necessary to strengthen the management of private electromechanical irrigation, which accounts for a major proportion of the province's business, actively strengthen education for pump owners, so that they can obey the needs of agricultural production, accept government scheduling, reasonably charge water fees, and regularly repair and maintain machinery and equipment. In terms of business methods, based on needs and possibilities, gradually promote orderly contracting of fields, joint contracting of fields, or the establishment of joint irrigation stations, etc., to give play to their beneficial aspects for agricultural production, and to prevent speculative behaviors such as indiscriminate contracting, breach of contract, and price gouging.

    江苏省加强对机电灌溉事业的领导和管理
    江苏省人民政府水利厅最近召开了全省一九五四年第一次机电灌溉工作会议，决定进一步加强机电灌溉事业的领导和管理，充分发挥机电灌溉设备的效能。
    该省机电灌溉事业较发达，全省现有国营、私营和农民自办的电力灌溉站二百零七处，共一万多马力，灌溉五十二万多亩农田；国营、私营和农民自办的抽水机站，共有抽水机四千二百多台，七万多马力，灌溉三百多万亩农田。
    会议认为，在今后工作上，必须重视和加强对国营抽水机站工作的领导；加强对农民自办的机械灌溉事业的指导，协助他们建立组织，实行民主管理，合理负担水费。对占该省主要比重的私营机电灌溉事业必须加强管理，积极加强对抽水机户的教育，使他们能服从农业生产需要，接受政府的调度，合理收取水费，经常修理保养好机器设备。在经营方式上根据需要与可能，逐步推行有次序的包田、联合包田或建立联合灌溉站等，以发挥其为农业生产服务的有利一面，并制止其滥包、违约、抬价等投机行为。
