Songjiang Province Vigorously Cultivates Agricultural and Forestry Technical Cadres

    To meet the needs of the state's socialist transformation of agriculture, the Agricultural Department and the Forestry Department of the People's Government of Songjiang Province plan to train more than 1,300 intermediate and junior agricultural and forestry technical cadres within three years. At the same time, more than 5,000 existing cadres and technical workers will be trained to improve their professional competence and technical level. The leadership is now taking various measures to consolidate and expand the existing secondary and primary technical schools, and to train intermediate and junior technical personnel in a planned manner. At the same time, training courses will be set up to train district-level agricultural and forestry leading cadres and technical personnel in rotation. The Agricultural and Forestry Departments will first focus on training the directors of state-owned farms, demonstration and breeding farms, and tractor station sections, as well as production team leaders, directors of forest management offices, and leading backbone and technical cadres of county and district agricultural and forestry departments. State-owned farms and other units will use methods such as taking apprentices, technical research seminars, and special report meetings to organize technical workers and general professional cadres to conduct business studies to improve their professional and political levels.
    Currently, the Forestry Department of Songjiang Province has transferred 200 technical cadres and management cadres to concentrate on training. Various state-owned farms, forest management offices, and other units have established various learning organizations and are helping employees solve various problems in their studies. Agricultural and forestry technical schools and agricultural machinery schools have formulated plans for training and improving teachers and are actively improving teaching work. The two schools currently have more than 900 students, and plan to expand enrollment by more than 500 students this summer. The agricultural cadre training class plans to train 66 accounting instructors for cooperatives in various places this year to meet the needs of the development of agricultural production cooperatives in 1955.
