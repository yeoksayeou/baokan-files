Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: TASS Moscow, May 14th: "Pravda" correspondents Zhukov and Pulishevsky, in an article commenting on the progress of the Geneva Conference, pointed out: Two political lines have become very clear at the conference.

	One is the line that advocates Asian countries gaining national independence and autonomy, and working together to establish peace and friendship among nations, thereby ensuring the free development of the people of Asian countries.

	This is the position of the true representatives of the Asian people at the Geneva Conference – the delegations of the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This line has been fully supported by the Soviet delegation, which supports the national liberation of all nations, supports their unimpeded development, and defends peace and friendship among nations.

	The other line aims to maintain the outdated privileges of colonial countries in Asia, which the people of the various countries living on this vast continent are opposing with the utmost determination.

	To implement this line, the colonial countries, headed by the United States, are conspiring to establish military blocs, which they want to use to consolidate the colonial system in Asia and suppress national liberation movements.

	The article lists facts to prove that this conspiracy has been resolutely resisted by Asian countries. Zhukov and Pulishevsky emphasized that the attitude of Asian countries towards this convention planned by the United States once again proves that the old colonial policy has been completely discredited and is irretrievable. The people of Asian countries have embarked on a new path, and no one can stop their genuine democratic development.

	The article continues by saying that one cannot ignore the fact that even the United States' closest allies do not support the adventurous policies of the U.S. State Department. They realize that at this stage, it is impossible to maintain control over Asia.

	However, the American colonialists are bent on exerting greater pressure on their allies. Dulles' recent attempt to blackmail France is proof of this.

	On the evening of May 11th, rumors spread in the "House of Journalists" that Dulles had announced at a press conference on May 11th that the United States would "defend" Southeast Asia even without Indochina. This statement not only caused confusion among French journalists, but also affected Mr. Bidault, the head of the French delegation attending the Geneva Conference. According to French journalists, government officials in Paris were also equally alarmed. However, according to the full text of Dulles' statement at the press conference, which was received later, there was no indication that the U.S. policy had changed in the slightest. This deliberately ambiguous statement, which greatly alarmed the French ruling group, was intended to blackmail the French government into agreeing to participate in the Asian aggressive bloc that the United States is stepping up to piece together.

	Due to the class blindness of the American diplomats and their delusion of intending to maintain the long-bankrupt colonial rule at any cost, they are absolutely unwilling to face up to the changes taking place in Asia. In contrast to the power politics of the United States, namely the policy of attempting to establish a new military bloc composed of those who are keen to maintain colonial rule and hinder national liberation movements, there is another policy, which is to unite the people of Asian countries and work together to ensure universal peace and security.

### “真理报”记者评日内瓦会议上的两条政治路线

    “真理报”记者评日内瓦会议上的两条政治路线
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“真理报”驻日内瓦记者茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基在评论日内瓦会议的进展的文章中指出：两条政治路线已经十分清楚地在会议上显现出来了。
    一条就是主张亚洲各国人民获得民族独立自主并共同努力建立和平与各国间的友谊，从而确保亚洲各国人民的自由发展的路线。
    这就是亚洲人民在日内瓦会议上的真正代表——中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的代表团的立场。这条路线得到了苏联代表团的充分支持。苏联代表团是支持各国人民的民族解放、支持他们的不受阻碍的发展、维护和平与各国间的友谊的。
    另一条路线的目的是要保持殖民国家在亚洲的过了时的特权，而居住在这个辽阔的大陆上的各国人民正在以最大的决心反对这些特权。
    以美国为首的殖民国家为了实行这条路线，正在阴谋策动建立军事集团，它们想通过这个军事集团来巩固亚洲的殖民制度并镇压民族解放运动。
    文章列举事实证明这个阴谋受到了亚洲国家的坚决反抗。茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基强调指出：亚洲国家对美国策划的这个公约的这种态度又一次证明了：陈旧的殖民政策已经完全名誉扫地、无可挽回了。亚洲各国人民已经走上一条新的道路，任何人都不能阻止他们真正的民主发展。
    文章接着说，人们不能无视这样的事实：甚至美国的关系最密切的盟国也不支持美国国务院的冒险政策。它们认识到：在现阶段，要保持对亚洲的统治，已经是不可能了。
    但是美国殖民主义者却一味要对他们的盟国施加更大的压力。杜勒斯最近讹诈法国的企图就可以证明这一点。
    五月十一日晚间，“记者之家”里散布着谣言，说杜勒斯五月十一日在记者招待会上宣布：没有印度支那，美国也要“保卫”东南亚。这个声明不仅在法国记者中间造成了混乱，而且也使出席日内瓦会议的法国代表团团长皮杜尔受到影响。据法国记者们说，巴黎的政府人士也同样惊慌。然而根据以后接到的杜勒斯在记者招待会上发表的声明的全文，证明美国的政策丝毫没有改变的迹象。这种使法国统治集团非常惊慌的故意含糊其辞的说法，目的是要向法国政府进行讹诈，使它同意参加正由美国加紧拼凑的亚洲侵略集团。
    由于美国外交官们的阶级盲目性以及打算不惜任何代价来保持久已破产的殖民统治的妄想，他们绝不愿意正视亚洲正在发生的变化。与美国的实力政策、即企图建立由那些热心于保持殖民统治以及阻碍民族解放运动的国家组成的新的军事集团的政策相反的，是另一种政策，就是团结亚洲各国人民，共同努力来保证普遍和平与安全的政策。
