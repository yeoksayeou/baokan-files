    Henan Province's wheat is growing very well. Barley, rapeseed, and other early spring crops have matured. Barring unforeseen disasters, the province will be able to fulfill or exceed its summer production increase target. The Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lushan County, located at the foot of the Funiu Mountains, conducted a focused inspection of fifty mu of wheat and expects a general increase of over 10% compared to last year's average yield of 253 jin per mu. Another five mu of wheat are projected to yield over 1000 jin per mu, surpassing the highest historical record in the area. The good growth of wheat on both banks of the Huai River is rare in recent years. The wheat in the Yellow River irrigation area already resembles a green ocean of rolling waves. Currently, many farms and agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province have formulated or are formulating summer harvest and planting plans. The combine harvesters of the Bo'ai and Huang Fanqu state-owned farms have been repaired and are ready. Staff members of the Baiquan Special District farm are testing horse-drawn farm implements. The state-owned Xihua Tractor Station is preparing to jointly formulate a plan with the Ling Heini and Gao Yumei Agricultural Production Cooperatives in the Huang Fanqu area to welcome the wheat harvest.

    On the 13th, Henan Province experienced widespread rainfall, much to the delight of the farmers. This rain came at the right time for spring sowing and wheat grouting, ensuring good seedling emergence and also increasing the wheat harvest.

    河南省小麦生长良好
    河南省小麦生长情况很好，大麦、菜子等早春作物已经成熟，如无意外灾害，全省将能完成或超额完成夏季增产任务。位于伏牛山麓的鲁山县苏殿选农业生产合作社，有重点地检查了五十亩小麦，一般可在去年每亩平均产量二百五十三斤的基础上，增产一成多。另有五亩小麦，预计每亩可产千斤以上，超过当地历史上的最高纪录。淮河两岸小麦生长情况的良好，是多年来所罕有的。引黄灌溉区小麦已像一片波浪起伏的绿色海洋。现在，全省不少农场和农业生产合作社已订出或正在订立夏收夏种计划。博爱和黄泛区两国营农场的康拜因，已修理停当。百泉专区农场的职工正在试验马拉农具。国营西华拖拉机站，正准备和黄泛区凌黑妮、高玉梅农业生产合作社共同制订计划，迎接麦收。

    十三日，河南省普遍降雨，农民异常欢喜。这场雨正落在春季播种和小麦灌浆的时候，可以保证禾苗出得好，同时小麦也能因此增加收成。
