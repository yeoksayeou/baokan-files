    First Primary School Established in the Northern Foothills of the Himalayas
    Recently, the first primary school has appeared in the mountainous area on the northern foothills of the Himalayas. This primary school is located in Kongma Village, Kangmazong (north-west of Xigaze) at the foot of the snow-capped mountains, and already has thirty-five students. In the past, this remote mountainous area never had a school, and children had no opportunity to attend school for generations. On March 31st this year, with the help of the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xigaze, this primary school officially opened. Tibetan farmers and herdsmen within a radius of thirty to forty li happily led their children to school. Now, Tibetan children are learning their own national language at this school. This is the beginning of a new cultural life for the Tibetan people in the Himalayan region after the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

    喜马拉雅山北麓山区设立第一所小学
    喜马拉雅山北麓的山区里，最近出现了第一所小学。这所小学设在雪山下的康巴宗（日喀则西偏北）的孔马村，现在已有三十五个学生。过去这个偏远的山区，从来没有过学校，儿童们世世代代都没有上学读书的机会。今年三月三十一日在班禅堪布会议厅和驻日喀则人民解放军的帮助下，这所小学正式开学了。周围三、四十里以内的藏族农牧民们都愉快地领着自己的孩子前来上学。现在藏族儿童们正在这个学校里学习着本民族的语文。这是喜马拉雅山区的藏族人民在西藏和平解放后获得的新的文化生活的开始。
