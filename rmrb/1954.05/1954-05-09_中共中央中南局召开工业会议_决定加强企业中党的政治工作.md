    The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau Convenes Industrial Conference
    Decides to Strengthen the Party's Political Work in Enterprises
    [Our Wuhan Dispatch, May 8th] The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau convened its Fourth Industrial Conference from April 20th to May 4th. The conference summarized and reviewed the Party's political work in factories, mines, basic construction, and transportation enterprises, focusing on studying how to strengthen the Party's political work and clearly putting forward the direction for strengthening the Party's political work in enterprises.
    The conference first conducted an in-depth examination of the Party's political work in factories, mines, basic construction, and transportation enterprises in the Central-South region. It was believed that in the past, the Party organizations in these enterprises had made significant achievements in the political and ideological education of workers and staff, the guarantee and supervision of national plans, the cultivation and promotion of cadres, and the development and consolidation of Party organizations, ensuring the completion of the tasks of these enterprises. However, there were still some shortcomings in working methods and styles. For example, the boundaries between the work of the Party and the administrative departments were not clearly defined, resulting in the Party undertaking administrative affairs on behalf of the administrative departments, thereby relaxing political and ideological work, or conducting this work in isolation from production. In some enterprises, there was a growing tendency to neglect political work.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, the conference used the method of criticism and self-criticism, combined with discussions on the importance of political work, to criticize the thinking of cadres in some enterprise Party organizations who were unwilling or did not strive to study political work. It pointed out that these erroneous ideas were mainly due to an insufficient understanding of the significance and major role of the Party's political work, and the existence of varying degrees of individualism in their ideology and awareness, resulting in disputes over status, comparisons of treatment, and reluctance to settle down in their current positions.
    Regarding the issue of changing the Party's working methods and the work style of cadres, the cadres attending the conference restudied the Party Constitution, clarified the nature of Party organizations in enterprises (regardless of the size of the production unit) as grassroots organizations, and the characteristics of enterprises such as planning and centralization. The content, methods, and style of the Party's work in enterprises should conform to the functions of grassroots organizations and also meet the characteristics of production enterprises. Therefore, the main tasks of Party organizations in enterprises are to guarantee and supervise production and administrative work, and their work content is mainly political and ideological leadership, management and training of cadres, and mass work. The working method is the combination of politics and economics, and a thorough, specific, intense, and combative working style.
    The conference further specified the basic tasks of Party organizations in production enterprises and the methods for establishing a normal working order. The conference clearly pointed out that Party organizations in enterprises should firmly grasp two basic links: first, guaranteeing and supervising the correct formulation and smooth completion of production plans, focusing on links such as drafting plans, issuing plans, and implementing plans, strengthening political and ideological leadership, and systematically implementing guarantee and supervision. In basic construction units, political work should be carried out according to the characteristics of the enterprises, paying attention to strengthening political and ideological work during the preparatory and completion periods to ensure the accuracy of survey and design and the smooth transfer of production. Another basic link in the work of enterprise Party organizations is to guarantee and supervise the correct implementation of the system of one-chief leadership and democratic management. Party organizations must conscientiously lead cadres to study, so that everyone can deeply understand the significance of the one-chief leadership system, and pay attention to carrying out ideological struggle. At the same time, consolidating this system should be regarded as one of their regular tasks. The conference also made preliminary arrangements for the methods and steps for establishing the one-chief system.
    The conference emphasized that the Party organization's supervision and guarantee of production and administrative work does not rely on anything else, but mainly on the Party's mass work—political and ideological education work and organizational work for the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp the political and ideological education of workers and staff, and use the Party's general line in the transition period and socialist ideology to educate Party members and workers and staff, improve their socialist consciousness, continuously enhance their national concept, planning concept, and overall concept, and continuously consolidate labor discipline and develop the spirit of hard struggle. In order to effectively carry out the political and ideological education of workers and staff, it is necessary to combine regular political education with propaganda and mobilization in production, so that Party classes, Communist Youth League classes, and mass political classes in enterprises are regularized; at the same time, it is necessary to adapt to the needs of labor competitions, grasp the leadership of propaganda work, and adopt various methods for propaganda and mobilization. At the same time, the leadership of workers' cultural education and technical education should be strengthened accordingly, and should be regularized and systematized. The conference pointed out that in order to do a good job in the Party's mass work in enterprises, it is also necessary to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the trade unions and the Communist Youth League, and give full play to their organizational role. In terms of organizational work, attention should be paid to developing the Party, consolidating the Party, and strengthening the training and management of cadres. The most important thing at present is to promote transferred cadres to earnestly study their professions and turn them into the backbone of industrial construction; at the same time, according to the assessment of daily production work, boldly train and promote outstanding workers and intellectuals to become new technicians or managers.

    中共中央中南局召开工业会议
    决定加强企业中党的政治工作
    【本报武汉八日电】中共中央中南局从四月二十日到五月四日召开了第四次工业会议。会议总结和检查了厂矿、基本建设、交通运输企业中党的政治工作，集中研究了如何加强党的政治工作的问题，明确地提出了加强企业中党的政治工作的方向。
    会议首先对中南各厂矿基本建设、交通运输企业中党的政治工作，作了深入的检查，认为过去这些企业的党组织对职工群众的政治思想教育、国家计划的保证监督以及培养提拔干部、发展巩固党的组织等方面，都作出了较显著的成绩，保证了这些企业任务的完成。但在工作方法和作风方面，还有一些缺点。如与行政部门工作界限划分不清，包办代替行政事务，以致放松了政治思想工作，或脱离生产孤立地进行这一工作，等等。某些企业还开始滋长忽视政治工作的倾向。
    会议根据四中全会的精神，用开展批评与自我批评的方法，结合对政治工作重要性的讨论，对一些企业党组织的干部不愿或不努力钻研政治工作的思想，进行了批判，指出这些错误思想主要是由于对党的政治工作的意义和重大作用认识不深刻，在思想意识上存在着程度不同的个人主义思想，闹地位、比待遇、不安心本岗位工作。
    关于改变党的工作方法和干部工作作风的问题，到会干部重新学习了党章，明确了企业中（不管生产单位大小）党组织都是基层组织的性质，并具有计划性、集中性等企业的特点，党在企业中的工作内容、工作方法和工作作风，既要符合于基层组织的职能，又应符合生产企业的特点。因此企业中党组织主要是保证与监督生产与行政工作，其工作内容主要是政治思想领导工作，管理、培养干部和群众工作。工作方法则是政治与经济相结合的方法，及深入、具体、紧张、战斗性的工作作风。
    会议进一步具体规定了生产企业中党组织的基本任务以及建立正常工作秩序的方法。会议明确指出企业中党组织应紧紧掌握两个基本环节：首先是保证、监督正确制定和顺利完成生产计划，抓紧编制计划、下达计划、贯彻计划等环节，加强政治思想领导，有系统地实行保证监督。在基本建设单位中，应根据企业的特点进行政治工作，注意在筹建和竣工时期加强政治思想工作，以保证勘察设计的准确和顺利地移交生产。企业党组织的工作中另一基本环节，就是保证监督一长负责制与管理民主化的正确实施。党组织必须认真领导干部学习，使大家深刻理解一长负责制的意义，并注意开展思想斗争。同时还应将巩固这一制度当成自己的经常任务之一。会议并对建立一长制的方法和步骤作了初步的布置。
    会议强调指出：企业党组织对生产、行政工作实行监督保证，不是依靠别的，主要是依靠党的群众工作——对群众的政治思想教育工作和组织工作。因此必须抓紧对职工群众的政治思想教育，用党在过渡时期的总路线和社会主义思想来教育党员和职工群众，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，不断增强国家观念、计划观念、整体观念，不断巩固劳动纪律，发挥艰苦奋斗的精神。为有效地进行职工群众的政治思想教育，必须把正规的政治教育和生产中的宣传鼓动结合起来，使企业中的党课、团课和群众性的政治课作到经常化；同时又必须适应劳动竞赛的需要，抓紧对宣传工作的领导，并采用各种方式进行宣传鼓动。同时还应相应地加强对职工文化教育和技术教育的领导，并做到经常化和制度化。会议指出，要做好企业党的群众工作，还一定要加强对工会和青年团的政治思想领导，充分发挥其组织作用。在组织工作方面，则应注意发展党、巩固党，加强干部的培养与管理工作。当前最重要的则是推动转业干部认真钻研业务，把他们培养成为工业建设的骨干；同时根据对日常生产工作的考核，大胆培养提拔优秀的工人、知识分子成为新的技术人员或管理人员。
