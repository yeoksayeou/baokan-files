Shanxi Province Universally Carries Out Pre-Purchase Work of Agricultural Products

The whole of Shanxi Province is universally carrying out the pre-purchase work of agricultural products. According to incomplete statistics at the end of April, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have signed pre-purchase contracts with more than 3,000 agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and more than 80,000 farm households. The pre-purchased grain amounts to more than 2.7 million jin, and cotton amounts to more than 24.5 million jin.

Before carrying out the pre-purchase work, pre-purchase work conferences were held from the provincial to the county level, and cadres from cooperative and other departments were organized to conscientiously study the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on the 1954 agricultural product pre-purchase work, and correct their views on the pre-purchase work. Then, in combination with the publicity of the general task during the national transition period and the spring plowing production work, various places thoroughly publicized the significance and methods of the pre-purchase work to the masses of farmers. The broad masses of farmers have actively signed pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. Mutual aid groups and cotton farmers in Nanjia Village, Jie County, signed 28 contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative in three days, pre-selling 81,800 jin of seed cotton. The pre-purchase work in Yuncheng and Linfen prefectures has progressed relatively quickly. By the end of April, they had signed more than 15,900 contracts with farmers, pre-purchasing more than 20 million jin of cotton.

In the pre-purchase work, all localities generally paid attention to starting from organizing farmers' production, helping farmers arrange production, and at the same time strengthening the supply of means of production and means of livelihood. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups re-revised their production plans in the process of signing contracts based on the needs of the country. For example, after the Wang Laifu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liucun Village, Pingshun County, signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, it increased the planting of cotton fields and oil crops by 44 mu, and at the same time, in order to increase the yield per unit area, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu was increased from 78 dan to 92 dan. In order to ensure increased agricultural production, the broad masses of farmers promptly invested the deposit obtained from pre-selling agricultural products into production. For example, after the Shuguang and Koucun Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Yuci County signed pre-purchase contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative, they immediately used the deposit to purchase 12,000 jin of cake fertilizer, 1,100 jin of fertilizer powder, and a batch of farm implements.

In terms of the distribution of deposits, all localities generally solved the difficulties of farmers in production and life in a concentrated manner through mobilizing the masses for democratic consultation. After Nanjia Village, Jie County, announced the total amount of the deposit, it mobilized the masses to report the amount of the deposit to be used, and after democratic consultation, promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity among farmers, and took care of households in difficulty.

    山西省普遍开展农产品预购工作
    山西全省普遍开展农产品预购工作。据四月底的不完全统计，各地供销合作社已和三千多个农业生产合作社、互助组及八万多个农户签订了预购合同。预购到的粮食有二百七十多万斤，棉花有二千四百五十多万斤。
    在开展预购工作以前，从省到县都召开了预购工作会议，组织合作社等部门的干部认真学习了中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于一九五四年农产品预购工作的指示，端正了对预购工作的看法。然后，各地即结合国家过渡时期总任务的宣传和春耕生产工作，向农民群众深入宣传了预购工作的意义和办法。广大农民都纷纷自动和供销合作社订立预购合同。解县南贾村的互助组和棉农在三天内就和供销合作社签订二十八份合同，预售籽棉八万一千八百斤。运城、临汾两专区预购工作进展较快，到四月底，已和农民签订一万五千九百多份合同，预购棉花二千多万斤。
    在预购工作中，各地一般都注意了从组织农民生产入手，帮助农民安排生产，同时加强了生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。许多农业生产合作社和互助组在签订合同的过程中，根据国家的需要，重新修订了生产计划。如平顺县留村王来富农业生产合作社和供销合作社签订合同后，增种了四十四亩棉田和油料作物，同时为了提高单位面积产量，把每亩施肥数量由七十八担增加到九十二担。广大农民为了保证农作物增产，都及时把预售农产品所得的定金投入生产。如榆次县曙光、寇村两个农业生产合作社和供销合作社签订预购合同以后，便立即用定金购回饼肥一万二千斤、肥田粉一千一百斤及一批农具。
    在定金的发放方面，各地一般都通过发动群众民主协商，集中地解决了农民生产和生活上的困难。解县南贾村宣布定金总数以后，发动群众自报使用定金的数字，经过民主协商，发扬了农民间的互助友爱精神，照顾了困难户。　　（鲁生）
