    Xinjiang Province will build and expand nineteen secondary schools this year. The construction area for the four new secondary schools is over 11,000 square meters, and the construction area for the expansion of the fifteen secondary schools is over 18,000 square meters. Currently, some of the projects have already started, and it is expected that all projects will be basically completed before the school starts this autumn. The new schools this year include two senior high schools in Urumqi and Yining, and two junior high schools in Yengisar County and Yecheng County. The fifteen secondary schools being expanded will have additional classes.
    In the early days of liberation, Xinjiang Province had only twenty poorly equipped secondary schools with fewer than 10,000 students. In the past four years, the People's Government has vigorously developed education for all ethnic groups. By last year, there were already sixty secondary schools in Xinjiang, with more than 23,000 secondary school students. This autumn, after the completion of the new and expanded school buildings, the number of secondary school students in Xinjiang will reach nearly 30,000. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆今年将新建和扩建十九所中等学校
    新疆省今年将新建和扩建十九所中等学校。新建四所中学的工程面积有一万一千多平方公尺，扩建十五所中学的工程面积有一万八千多平方公尺。目前，部分工程已经动工，预计在今年秋季学校开学前，各项工程可基本完工。今年新建的学校有乌鲁木齐市和伊宁市两所高级中学，英吉沙县和叶城县两所初级中学。扩建的十五所中学中将增设班次。
    解放初期，新疆省只有二十所设备简陋的中等学校，学生不到一万人。四年来，人民政府大力发展各族人民的教育事业，到去年全新疆已有六十所中等学校，中学学生达两万三千多名。今年秋季，新建和扩建的校舍基本完工后，全新疆中学学生将达到近三万名。　（新华社）
