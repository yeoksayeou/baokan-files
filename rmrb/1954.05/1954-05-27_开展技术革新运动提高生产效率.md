Launch a Technical Innovation Campaign to Improve Productivity

Forever Ending the Suffering of Coal Washing Workers

Zheng Maoya, Deputy Director of the Coal Washing Plant of the Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi, created a combined coal washing machine, which mechanized the manual coal washing process at the Pingxiang Mine.

Previously, most of the mining and transportation work at the Pingxiang Coal Mine was mechanized, but coal washing was still done manually. Regardless of wind, rain, heat, or cold, workers had to stand in the open-air coal washing yard and wash coal by hand, which resulted in many workers suffering from dampness, arthritis, and typhoid fever. Even so, they couldn't keep up with the needs of production. Now, when people pass by the coal washing plant, they no longer see rows of coal washing buckets or groups of bare-legged, bare-armed coal washing workers. Instead, they see a magnificent combined coal washing machine, 18 meters high and more than 30 meters long, and six or seven workers operating the machine. According to incomplete statistics, one coal washing machine can wash the equivalent of 250 laborers' worth of coal in one day and night.

Automatic Coal Chute Loading Machine

Since April 1st, an "automatic coal chute loading machine" has appeared on the loading platform of the No. 2 Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi, with coal flowing into the coal cars like water through four chutes.

This "automatic coal chute loading machine" was created collectively by the staff of the Electromechanical Section of No. 2 Mine. In the past, loading coal onto trains was done manually, basket by basket. After using a conveyor belt loading machine in January, the labor intensity of the workers was greatly reduced. When loading by manpower, it took six people two hours to fill a 30-ton car, but after changing to a conveyor belt loading machine, it only took three workers 30 minutes to fill a 30-ton car. Now, using this "automatic coal chute loading machine" to load coal, the efficiency is 2.6 times higher than using the conveyor belt loading machine.

Open Hearth Furnace Doors Can Now Open and Close Automatically

The open hearth furnace doors in the steelmaking workshop of Factory 101 were very heavy, and it took a lot of manpower to pull them open each time. Worker Yang Mingsong often thought, "If only there was a way to make the furnace doors open and close automatically!" Last August, he began designing an automatic opening and closing machine for the furnace doors, but he didn't succeed after several months. At this time, some people said, "Automation is not so easy..." But Yang Mingsong did not lose heart. He thought, "When you do something, there are always some difficulties at the beginning. With the support of the Party and the workers, and with my own hard work, I will definitely succeed." When installing the base of the automatic opening and closing machine for the furnace doors, there was a shortage of "sheaves." He searched the scrap steel pile again and again, but couldn't find any. Later, he ran to the construction section to find engineer Huo Shiting, who solved the problem of the sheaves. Many comrades in the machine shop and foundry shop also helped him to machine all the necessary accessories. After their hard work, the automatic opening and closing machine for the furnace doors was completely installed on April 8th. After the good news of the successful trial run spread, many people came to see the machine, giving it a thumbs up and saying, "Great, the open hearth furnace doors can now open and close automatically!" In the past, the open hearth furnace in the steelmaking workshop required at least four people per shift to pull the furnace doors for eight hours a day. Now, only one person is needed to control the automatic electric switch, and it is also more convenient to take steel samples and add materials.

Construction Workers Study Technology and Improve Tools

Construction workers of the Engineering Team of the Linjiang Forest Administration Bureau in Liaodong Province, based on the characteristics of the forest area, created new tools such as the double-edged rabbet and bevel plane and the foot-operated rabbeting machine after more than 40 days of research. In the past, woodworking for rabbeting door and window sashes and beveling required two processes and six tools. With the newly created double-edged rabbet and bevel plane, only two tools and one operation are needed, and even apprentices can operate it. Construction efficiency has increased by 150 percent, and quality has increased by 60 percent. In the past, woodworking for making floorboard grooves was very laborious. After the foot-operated rabbeting machine was made, the situation changed, and efficiency doubled. Quality has also improved, and skilled workers are also saved.

Remodeling Old Cotton Ginning Machines into Hulling Machines

Zhang Xuemeng, head of the Technology Section of the Baoding Oil Factory in Hebei, constantly has new inventions and creations in production and has gloriously won the title of labor model for three consecutive years. In order to save wealth for the country, he often goes deep into the workshop to study and improve machines, reducing the kernel content in cotton hulls. Once, he thought of the unusable cotton ginning machine in the factory yard. If it could be remodeled into a useful hulling machine, wouldn't that save money and be faster? One day, he put forward this idea at a technical research meeting. At that time, some technical personnel disagreed with him, thinking that it would not play a big role; some technicians were also unwilling to use scrap materials for remodeling, saying that they would rather make new ones. However, Zhang Xuemeng insisted on remodeling the scrap cotton ginning machine into a hulling machine. He made up his mind, worked hard, and finally succeeded in remodeling it. According to preliminary statistics, after using the hulling machine, the kernel content of cotton hulls dropped from 3.1 percent to 0.5 percent. In this way, if calculated on the basis of 250 production days a year, 135,000 catties more cake and 81,000 catties more oil can be produced, saving the country more than 378 million yuan in wealth.

Coking Fine Powder Can No Longer Be Lost

One holiday in July last year, Zhong Jisheng, head of the Electromechanical Section of the Xishan Coal Washing Plant of the Jixi Coal Mine in Songjiang, went to Liumahe to fish. He stood in the river and fished for half a day without catching a fish. When he went ashore, he found that his feet were covered with "black mud." He was very surprised and grabbed a handful from the bottom of the river. Upon closer inspection, it was not river sediment, but fine powder mixed with coal slurry. Zhong Jisheng understood: this must be coking fine powder leaking from the dewatering machine of the coal washing plant.

He was very distressed to see so much fine powder being lost. He went back and found out that the fine powder was indeed leaking from under the dewatering machine. So he thought of setting up a screen under the dewatering machine to recover the fine powder. With the help of technician Li Weimin, he finally created a small "vibrating screen," which solved the problem of coking fine powder leaking from the dewatering machine of the coal washing plant. In the past four months, it has recovered more than 4,300 tons of fine powder for Anshan Iron and Steel to use for coking, worth more than 1.4 billion yuan. Now, he has remodeled two large "vibrating screens," which can completely recover all the fine powder.

Decades-Old Machines Have Changed

In the past, the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau was often questioned by users: "Why can't I always hear anything on the phone?" "Why can't I get through after dialing the phone number for a long time?" One of the reasons for these problems was that the signaling machine in the power room was malfunctioning at that time. Once, when Zhou Zhonghua, a young maintenance worker in the power room, was on duty, the alarm suddenly sounded, and the voltage exceeded the specified range, affecting the normal power supply and hindering users' calls. He thought: The voltage cannot be adjusted automatically, and someone has to stand next to the machine all day long to adjust it, which is a great waste of labor, and accidents can happen if you are not careful. So he made up his mind to improve the machine. After his hard work and the help of the leadership, this April, he installed rotating "line keys" on the power components for testing, creating a voltage automatic adjustment device, which kept the voltage in a normal state. After the successful experiment of automatic voltage adjustment, he continued to complete two devices for automatic replacement of signaling machines and automatic testing of signals, changing the appearance of the old machines of the past few decades.

After these creations were successful, if the signaling machine had an obstacle, it would automatically switch to another signaling machine to continue working. The voltage maintains a normal transmission from morning to night. At the same time, it used to take four people to perform maintenance work, but now only one person can complete the task, and labor efficiency has increased three times.

    开展技术革新运动提高生产效率
    永远结束了洗煤工人的痛苦
    江西萍乡煤矿洗选厂副厂长郑茂崖，创制了一部联合洗煤机，使萍乡矿的手工洗煤机械化了。
    以前，萍乡煤矿在开采、运输工作中大部都机械化了，而洗煤却还是手工作业。不论刮风下雨，天热天寒，工人们都得站在露天的洗煤坪里用手洗，因此工人中得湿气症、关节炎和伤寒病的很多。就这样，还赶不上生产的需要。如今，当人们路过洗选厂的时候，再看不到一排排的洗煤桶了，也看不到成群结队光腿、赤胳膊的洗煤工人了，看到的只有一个高十八公尺、长三十余公尺的雄伟的联合洗煤机，和六、七个操纵着机器的工人。据不完全统计，一部洗煤机一天一夜的洗煤效力相当于二百五十个劳动力。
      自动煤溜装车机
    从四月一日起，山西阳泉矿务局二矿的装车台上出现了一部“自动煤溜装车机”，煤像流水一样经过四个溜槽流到煤车里。
    这部“自动煤溜装车机”是二矿机电科职工集体创造的。过去往火车上装煤，都是由人工一筐一筐的扛上装。今年一月份，用皮带装车机后，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。用人力装车时，每六个人两小时才能装满一个三十吨的车皮，改为皮带装车机后，每三个工人三十分钟即可装满一个三十吨的车皮。现在用这部“自动煤溜装车机”装车，效率又比用皮带装车机提高二点六倍。
      平炉炉门能够自动开关了
      一零一厂炼钢车间的平炉炉门很笨重，每次开炉门都要用很大的人力拉。工人杨明松常想：“要是想个办法使炉门自动开关就好啦！”去年八月，他就开始设计炉门自动启闭机，可是过了几个月没有做成功。这时有人说：“搞自动化可不是这么容易呀……”但是杨明松并没有灰心，他想：“作一件事，开初总是有一些困难的，有党和工人们的支持，加上自己刻苦钻研，一定可以成功。”在安装炉门自动启闭机的机座时，缺少“绳轮”，他到废钢堆里找了一次又一次，但总也找不着，后来他跑到修建科去找霍世廷工程师，解决了绳轮问题。机工车间和铸造车间许多同志又帮他车制了全部所需的配件。经过他们辛勤的劳动，炉门自动启闭机在四月八日全部安装成功。试车成功的喜报传出后，许多人都来看机器，翘起大拇指说：“顶呱呱，平炉炉门都能自动启闭啦！”过去炼钢车间的平炉，每天八小时一班至少要四个人拉炉门，现在只要一人掌握自动电力开关就行了，并且取钢样，加材料也方便了。
    建筑工人钻研技术改进工具
    辽东省临江森林管理局工程队的建筑工人，根据林区特点，经过四十多天钻研，创造了裁口倒楞
  双刃刨子、脚踏裁口机等新工具。过去，木工裁门窗扇口和倒楞，要经过两道工序，需要六种工具。
  用新创造的裁口倒楞双刃刨子，只需要两种工具、 
  一次操作就行了，并且徒工也可以操作。施工效率
  提高了百分之一百五十，质量提高了百分之六十。过去，木工在制做地板口时，很费力气，脚踏裁口机制成后，情况就改变了，效率还提高了一倍。质量也提高了，同时还节省了技术工人。
    把旧的筛棉机改装成打皮机
    河北保定制油厂技术科科长张学孟，在生产上不断有新的发明创造，连续三年光荣地获得了劳动模范的称号。他为了给国家节约财富，经常深入车间，研究和改进机器，减少棉皮内的含仁量。一次，他想起了该厂院子里放着不能用的筛棉机，如果把它改装成为一个有用的打皮机，这不是又省钱又来的快吗？有一天，他就在技术研究会上提出了这一意见，当时个别技术人员不同意他这样作，认为起不了多大作用；有的技工也不愿意用废旧的料改装，说要做就做新的。但是张学孟坚持了用废旧的筛棉机改装成打皮机的意见。他下定决心，苦心钻研，终于改装成功了。据初步统计，使用打皮机后，棉皮含仁量由百分之三点一降到百分之零点五。这样如果一年按二百五十个生产日计算，就可多出饼十三万五千斤，多出油八万一千斤，可给国家节省财富三亿七千八百多万元。
    炼焦精粉再也漏不掉了
    在去年七月的一个假日里，松江鸡西滴道矿洗煤厂机电股股长仲继双到柳毛河去打鱼，站在河里打了半天，一条鱼也没打着，一上岸，发现两脚满是“黑泥”，他很惊讶，顺手往河底抓了一把，细一看并不是河底淤泥，而是精粉夹着煤泥。仲继双明白了：这一定是从洗煤厂脱水机跑漏出来的炼焦精粉。
    他看到精粉跑掉这么多，非常心痛。他回去搞清了精粉确实是从脱水机下面跑掉的。于是他就想在脱水机下边设一个回收精粉的筛子。他在技术员李维民的帮助下，终于创造出小型“震动筛子”，解决了洗煤厂脱水机跑漏炼焦精粉的问题。四个月来共回收了四千三百多吨精粉供应鞍钢炼焦用，价值十四亿余元。现在，他又改装了两台大型“震动筛子”，可以全部回收所有的精粉了。
      几十年的老机器变了样
    过去，南京电信局经常受到用户的责问：“为什么电话里老是听不到声音呀？”“为什么电话号码拨了半天总是打不通？”这些问题的原因之一，是因为动力间的信号机正在那时出了毛病。一次，正当动力间青年机务员周忠华值班的时候，告警铃突然响了，电压超过了规定范围，影响了电力正常供应，妨碍了用户通话。他想：电压不能自动调整，一天到晚要有人站在机器旁边来调整，劳动力的浪费很大，而且一不小心还要出事故。于是他就下定决心改进机器。经过他的刻苦钻研和领导上的帮助，今年四月份，他用旋转的“线键”装到动力机件上做试验，创造了电压自动调整的装置，使电压始终保持了正常状态。电压自动调整试验成功以后，他又继续完成了信号机自动替换、信号自动测试两个装置，使几十年来的老机器变了样。
      这些创造成功后，信号机出了障碍，就会自动的替换到另一部信号机上继续进行工作。电压从早到晚，都保持着正常的输送。同时从前需要四个人进行维护工作，现在只需一个人就能完成任务，劳动效率提高了三倍。
