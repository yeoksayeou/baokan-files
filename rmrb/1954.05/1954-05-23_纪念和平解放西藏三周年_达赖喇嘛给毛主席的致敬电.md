    Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
    A Congratulatory Telegram from the Dalai Lama to Chairman Mao

    To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    Today, on the third anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, the people of major cities and towns in the Tibetan region will join the People's Liberation Army stationed there in holding various celebratory activities. I and all the Tibetan people are joyously and excitedly celebrating this day of great historical significance. I hereby extend my highest respects to you on behalf of the Tibetan clergy and laity!
    Under your correct leadership and that of the Central People's Government, over the past three years, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet has correctly implemented your policies of national equality and freedom of religious belief, faithfully executed the agreement, and united with the broad masses of Tibetan clergy and laity, consolidating the southwest national defense. The unity of the Tibetan people and the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland, especially the unity between the Tibetan and Han peoples, has been continuously strengthened and consolidated, and the internal unity of the Tibetan people is also being strengthened.
    The great economic construction of the motherland is constantly achieving new successes and victories, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country are advancing along the road to happiness. The victories achieved by the great motherland in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the brilliant achievements in peaceful diplomacy, and the strong unity of all fraternal ethnic groups within the country and the strong unity within each ethnic group have all created an unprecedented great era in the history of the motherland. The achievement of all these successes and victories is inseparable from your wise and correct leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Under the shining light and assistance of your policies and those of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people have firm confidence in building their own happy lives. We will further consolidate the unity among our fraternal ethnic groups and within the ethnic group, heighten our vigilance, consolidate national defense, faithfully and gradually implement the agreement thoroughly, support and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, strive to complete the Kangzang Highway as soon as possible, and struggle to develop Tibet's political, economic, cultural and other construction undertakings, to build a great motherland, and to safeguard Asian and world peace. I respectfully wish you good health!

    Congratulatory Telegram from the Panchen Erdeni to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao:
    The joyous day for the people of the whole country and the people of Tibet—the third anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet—has arrived. I hereby extend my heartfelt and highest respects to you—the sun of all ethnic groups—on behalf of all the clergy, officials, and people of the Zhaxilhunbu Monastery. Over the past three years, under your wise leadership and kind care, as well as that of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Tibetan region, along with the high tide of the great economic construction of the motherland, has made great achievements in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural and educational undertakings, and has been continuously developing. The internal unity of the Tibetan people has also become closer. I thank the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet for their brotherly and selfless assistance to the Tibetan people, and thank them for faithfully implementing your great instructions and for protecting and respecting our religion. I would also like to thank General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, for his concern for us. The great Kangzang Highway is being built rapidly towards Lhasa. This is a road that will bring prosperity and happiness to the Tibetan people. We will not only support the construction of this road with all our strength, but also unite even better with the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet to make greater achievements in implementing the agreement and building the great family of the motherland.
    I wish our great motherland increasing prosperity and strength!
    I wish you boundless longevity! Panchen Erdeni, May 10, 1954
