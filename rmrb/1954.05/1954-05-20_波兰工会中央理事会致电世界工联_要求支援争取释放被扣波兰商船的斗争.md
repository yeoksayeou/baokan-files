    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 19th: According to a Polish Press Agency report from Warsaw, the Polish Central Council of Trade Unions cabled the World Federation of Trade Unions on the 18th regarding the incident in which the United States protected and helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang intercept Polish merchant ships. The cable stated: The responsibility for the two incidents in which the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang intercepted Polish merchant ships should be borne by the United States, because the United States supports the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, using it as a tool to create disturbances in the Far East. Moreover, American planes directly participated in the attacks on Polish merchant ships in both incidents. This illegal act by the United States has aroused extreme indignation among the Polish people. The Polish Central Council of Trade Unions requests the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to take measures to inform the broadest masses of working people of this situation and to call on them to support the activities to secure the immediate release of the detained merchant ships and their personnel.

    波兰工会中央理事会致电世界工联
    要求支援争取释放被扣波兰商船的斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰工会中央理事会十八日就美国庇护并帮助蒋介石匪帮截扣波兰商船事致电世界工会联合会。电文指出：蒋介石匪帮两次截扣波兰商船的事件的责任应由美国担负，因为美国支持着早已破产了的蒋介石匪帮，把它当作在远东制造骚乱的工具，而且美国飞机在两次事件中都直接参加了对波兰商船的袭击。美国这次的非法行为已激起了波兰人民的极端愤慨。波兰工会中央理事会请求世界工联书记处采取措施，把这种情况通知最广大的劳动人民群众，号召他们支援争取立即释放被扣商船及其人员的活动。
