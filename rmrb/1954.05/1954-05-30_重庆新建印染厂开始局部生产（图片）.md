    Chongqing's Newly Built Printing and Dyeing Factory Begins Partial Production
    The newly built printing and dyeing factory of the joint state-private Chongqing 610 and Cotton Textile Factory has begun partial production. This factory is the first relatively large-scale modern printing and dyeing factory in the Southwest. When it is fully operational, it will be able to bleach and dye 4,000 to 5,000 bolts of fine cloth and print and dye 2,000 bolts of printed cloth per day. The construction of the printing and dyeing factory will make the 610 Cotton Textile Factory a comprehensive factory including spinning, weaving, and dyeing, fundamentally changing the unbalanced state of spinning, weaving, and dyeing equipment in the Southwest.

    重庆新建印染厂开始局部生产
    公私合营重庆六一○、棉纺织厂新建的印染厂已开始局部生产。这个厂是西南第一个规模较大的新式印染厂。它全部投入生产后，每天能漂染细布四千到五千匹，印染花布二千匹。印染厂的建设将使六一○棉纺织厂成为一个包括纺、织、染的综合性工厂，基本上改变了西南纺、织、染设备不平衡状况。
