    Justice and Fairness are on the Side of the Indochinese People
    Tan Wenrui
    World public opinion is closely watching the discussions on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. The power of just public opinion in various countries has consistently proven to have a significant impact.
    Two different proposals for resolving the Indochina issue have been presented to the conference. One is the reasonable proposal put forward by Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is in line with the historical and realistic situation in Indochina; the other is the arbitrary conditions put forward by French delegation leader Bidault, which are one-sided, unrealistic, and unreasonable, reflecting the attitude of a colonial ruler.
    The suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are so appealing, while the reaction to Bidault's arbitrary conditions is so cold, that those who harbor ulterior motives and oppose a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue cannot help but panic. The spokesperson for the US delegation tried to distort the essence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal, saying that it was tantamount to France's "unconditional surrender" in Indochina. At the same time, US Secretary of State Dulles also shouted loudly in Washington that this was completely unacceptable.
    However, public opinion in various countries has a different view. The Paris newspaper "Liberation" commented on the 11th that the suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam meant that "peace is possible in Indochina... If Laniel and Bidault wish so, the negotiations in Geneva can make good progress quickly." The Indian newspaper "Hindustan Times" published a report from its Geneva correspondent on the 12th, saying: "If people are still prepared to negotiate with the Viet Minh—as everyone knows is unavoidable if the war is to be avoided from continuing—they cannot deny that these suggestions (put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) provide a realistic basis for discussion." At the same time, public opinion pointed out that Bidault's conditions were "unrealistic" (British "Daily Telegraph"), "unable to provide a possible basis for secret negotiations or public negotiations" (British "Observer").
    What has attracted attention in the words and actions of Washington figures is not their monotonous, dry, and rigid speeches at the Geneva Conference, but their relentless conspiracy activities to expand interference in the Indochina war (by diplomats, congressmen, and generals). Mrs. Tabouis, a journalist for the French newspaper "L'Information" in Geneva, frankly pointed out that what the United States is concerned about is "neither the presence of France in Indochina nor the fate of glorious negotiations, but a part of the Indochina territory that will be immediately incorporated into the US base chain."
    In recent days, public opinion in various countries has been discussing the US Ambassador to France, Dillon's, shuttling between Geneva and Paris to plan the US-French talks as ordered. Public opinion pointed out that the purpose of this meeting is for the United States and its accomplices in Paris to complete a deal, with Paris accepting "conditions" so that the United States can carry out direct armed intervention in Indochina.
    However, if Washington still stubbornly disregards the pressure of public opinion, then it is particularly inappropriate for the Laniel government to continue to stubbornly follow suit. After the French delegation flatly rejected Deputy Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's proposal on May 10, it had to hurriedly change its tone the next day, saying that the proposal could be "used as a basis for negotiation," which was no accident. Bidault's back-and-forth attitude can only further reduce the Laniel government's position and achieve nothing else. As many French newspapers pointed out, the French parliament only retained the extremely unpopular Laniel government with a majority of two votes in the second vote of confidence because it was unwilling to interrupt the Geneva Conference due to the fall of the cabinet. Does such a government still want to continue to sell out national interests and retrieve chestnuts from the fire for the United States? French Independent Republican Peasant Union parliamentarian Rago reflected the opinions of the majority of members of parliament, accusing the Laniel government of "being accustomed to viewing issues through the eyes of the Pentagon," but he said that he and his friends would not allow this government to lead France to a "situation where the entrance is controlled by the Americans and the retreat is controlled by the Germans."
    Public opinion believes that the battlefield is realistic, and the negotiating table should also be realistic. Speculation and opportunism can never achieve the goal. The French delegation must consider the suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in a pragmatic manner, so as to seek to achieve peace in Indochina on a basis acceptable to both parties.
    The suggestion of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to first stop the hostilities between the two parties before implementing various political settlement measures in the implementation plan, and to conclude appropriate agreements for this purpose, is in line with the common aspirations of people all over the world, including the French people. The Paris newspaper "Liberation" pointed out when summarizing the speeches of members of parliament from various parties at the National Assembly on May 4: An immediate ceasefire in Indochina "is the heartfelt desire of all members of the National Assembly." Independent Peasant Party parliamentarian Badot also accused "the government of not having the right to cause more people to die."
    Although Bidault also expressed his willingness to cease the war in Indochina at the Geneva Conference on May 8, the ceasefire proposal he put forward actually required the Vietnamese People's Army to withdraw and disarm, and to disband the people's armies of Laos and Cambodia. The Indonesian newspaper "Torch" commented on this proposal by Bidault, saying: "It is the French army itself that should be disarmed, not the Viet Minh's army and the people's armies of other Indochinese countries (Laos and Cambodia)." The Indian weekly "New Century" also pointed out that all parties believe that "Bidault's proposal is simply a series of surrender terms," and it "is nothing more than a dying struggle to maintain imperialist rule over Indochina."
    The French delegation's "sky-high price" that disregards the actual situation is obviously inconsistent with France's position. The French newspaper "Combat" reminded Bidault that he should know that now is not the time to "speak as a victor."
    Not only that, Bidault's plan only talks about military ceasefire, and completely ignores political issues. Such a ceasefire without a political foundation is obviously impossible to be stable. Only by further withdrawing all foreign troops and ensuring the unity and independence of the Indochinese people can a reliable guarantee be obtained for lasting peace in Indochina. Taking various feasible measures suggested by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can achieve this goal. The "Indian Times" recently wrote when commenting on the suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: "Since the purpose of the current discussions in Geneva is to promote peace and independence in Southeast Asia, the Viet Minh's demand that France explicitly recognize the 'sovereignty and independence' of the three Indochinese countries cannot be opposed. There can be no exception to the claim of a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops." The Indonesian newspaper "Civil Rights" also said: "The colonial system in Indochina should be abolished, and only then can lasting peace be established there."
    Although Bidault also said that he could accept the claim to recognize the sovereignty and independence of the three Indochinese countries, he attempted to describe the three regimes of Bao Dai, etc., as having already obtained "independence" in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This shows that France actually has no intention of handing over sovereignty and independence to the Indochinese people, because everyone knows that the likes of Bao Dai are just tools for French colonists to maintain their colonial rule, and now the United States is trying to grab them from France. The famous French professor Lavenir once said: The three regimes of Bao Dai, etc., are just "houses made of cards that can only exist with the help of French bayonets, and they will collapse immediately after the French expeditionary army withdraws."
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam's plan is also reasonable in that it not only advocates the realization of the unity of the three Indochinese countries through free and universal elections, but also indicates that the three Indochinese countries can study joining the French Federation in accordance with the principles of free will and the conditions of joining, and recognize France's existing economic and cultural interests in these countries. The French newspaper "Liberation" believes that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam advocates restoring peace in Indochina in this way, which is obviously not "an attitude of an enemy."
    The suggestions put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which have received widespread sympathy from world public opinion, have been supported by the delegations of China and the Soviet Union. The position and attitude taken by the Chinese and Soviet delegations are considered by public opinion to be in line with the interests of millions of peace-loving people.
    At the Geneva Conference on May 14, Foreign Minister Molotov put forward supplements to the plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, believing that it could be agreed to form a committee composed of representatives of neutral countries to undertake the task of supervising the ceasefire, and stated that France's proposal that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference provide guarantees for the agreements to be reached at the conference was acceptable in principle. This removed the excuses of those who attempted to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, and opened up a broad path for reaching an agreement.
    Foreign Minister Molotov's speech was universally welcomed by all parties, and even the British and French delegations had to admit that his suggestions had made progress in the conference. Even the Geneva correspondent of the US International News Agency believed that: "Molotov's actions strengthened the belief of some European representatives that Russia is sincerely eager to see the end of the Indochina war." Paris Radio France broadcast on the 15th: "The general mood here is in favor of compromise. After Molotov's speech this afternoon, French observers discovered some signs that could lead to a compromise... In short, the Geneva Conference has made progress this week."
    However, according to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 16th, Dulles once again stated in a speech in Williamsburg, Virginia: "The United States sees almost no hope of reaching a reasonable solution to the Indochina issue."
    This is no accident. Dulles is afraid of any possible progress at the Geneva Conference. He is currently betting his bets on a new conspiracy that will cause "France to promptly propose a specific proposal on US intervention in the Indochina war." This is why world public opinion needs to be particularly vigilant.

    正义和公道在印度支那人民方面
    谭文瑞
    世界各国公众舆论密切注视着日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论。各国公正的舆论的力量，始终证明它是具有巨大的影响作用的。
    两个解决印度支那问题的不同的方案已经向会议提出来了。一个是越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同所提出的，符合于印度支那的历史和现实情况的合理方案；另外一个是法国代表团团长皮杜尔以殖民统治者的态度所提出的，片面的、不现实、不合理的专横条件。
    越南民主共和国的建议是那样地吸引人心，而对皮杜尔的专横条件的反应却是那样地冷淡，这就不能不使得心怀鬼胎，反对和平解决印度支那问题的人们惊慌失措起来。美国代表团的发言人极力歪曲越南民主共和国的方案的实质，说什么这等于要法国在印度支那“无条件投降”。同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯也在华盛顿大声叫嚷说，这是完全不能接受的。
    但是，各国的公众舆论却有着不同的看法。巴黎“解放报”十一日评论说，越南民主共和国的建议意味着在印度支那获致“和平是可能的，……如果拉尼埃和皮杜尔希望那样的话，日内瓦的谈判可以很快获得良好的进展”。印度“印度斯坦时报”十二日发表该报驻日内瓦记者的报道说：“如果人们还准备和越盟进行谈判——大家知道，如果要避免战争继续下去，这是不可避免的——他们就不能否认（越南民主共和国提出的）这些建议为讨论提供了现实的基础”。同时公众舆论指出：皮杜尔提出的条件是“不现实的”（英国“每日电讯报”），
  “不能为秘密谈判或公开谈判提供一个可能的基础”（英国“观察家报”）。
    华盛顿的人物的言行，引起注视的不是他们在日内瓦会议上的单调、枯燥而死硬的发言，而是他们（外交家、议员和将军们）毫不放松的扩大干涉印度支那战争的阴谋活动。法国“新闻报”驻日内瓦记者塔布依夫人就直率地指出，美国所关心的“不是法国在印度支那的存在，也不是光荣的谈判的命运，而是一部分将立即并入美国基地锁链中去的印度支那领土。”
    这几天来，各国舆论就纷纷议论着美国驻法大使狄龙奔走日内瓦和巴黎之间所奉命筹划的美法会谈。舆论指出：这一会谈的目的，是美国和它在巴黎的同谋者准备完成一笔交易，由巴黎接受“条件”，使美国得以进行在印度支那的直接武装干涉。
    但是，如果说华盛顿仍悍然不顾舆论的压力，那末，拉尼埃政府要照样跟着硬干，是特别不合适的。法国代表团在五月十日断然拒绝了范文同代外长的建议之后，不得不在第二天就急忙改变口吻，说这个建议可以“作为谈判的一个基础”，这就不是偶然的。皮杜尔这种出尔反尔的态度，除了使拉尼埃政府的地位更加降低以外，不可能得到别的结果。正如许多法国报纸所指出的，法国议会在第二次投信任票时，只是由于不愿因倒阁而中断日内瓦会议，才以二票的多数保留了极不得人心的拉尼埃政府。这样的政府还想继续出卖民族的利益，为美国火中取栗吗？法国独立共和农民联盟议员拉哥反映了议会大多数议员的意见，他指责拉尼埃政府“已习惯于用五角大楼的眼光来看问题”，但是，他说他和他的朋友将不让这个政府把法国导向“被美国人控制了进路和被德国人控制了退路的境地”。
    舆论认为，战场上是现实的，谈判桌上也应该是现实的，投机取巧绝不可能达到目的。法国代表团必须以实事求是的态度来考虑越南民主共和国的建议，从而谋求在双方都能接受的基础上实现印度支那的和平。
    越南民主共和国建议在执行方案中各项政治解决措施之前先行停止双方敌对行动，并且为这个目的而缔结适当的协定，这是符合全世界人民包括法国人民的共同愿望的。巴黎“解放报”在总结各党派议员在五月四日国民议会上的发言时指出：在印度支那立即停火“是国民议会所有议员衷心渴望的。”独立农民党议员巴杜并指责“政府没有权利使更多的人死亡”。
    皮杜尔在五月八日的日内瓦会议上，虽然也表示愿意在印度支那停战，但是他所提出的停战建议却实际上要求越南人民军撤退和解除武装，并解散寮国和高棉的人民军队。印度尼西亚“火炬报”在评论这种皮杜尔的建议时说：“应当解除武装的正是法国军队自己，而不是越盟的军队和印度支那其他国家（寮国和高棉）的人民军队。”印度“新世纪”周报并指出：各方面舆论都认为“皮杜尔的建议简直就是一些要别人投降的条款”，它“无非是一种想保持对印度支那的帝国主义统治的垂死挣扎而已”。
    法国代表团这种不顾现实情况的“漫天要价”，显然是不符合法国的地位的。法国的“战斗报”就提醒皮杜尔，应该晓得目前已不是“以胜利者的姿态说话的时候了”。
    不仅这样，皮杜尔的方案只谈军事停战，而把政治问题完全撇开不提。这样的没有政治基础的停战显然是不可能稳固的，只有进一步撤退一切外国军队，确保印度支那人民的统一与独立，才能够使印度支那的持久和平获得可靠的保证。而采取越南民主共和国建议的各项切实可行的措施，就可以达到这样的目的。“印度时报”最近在评论越南民主共和国建议时写道：“由于目前在日内瓦进行的讨论目的在于促进和平与东南亚的独立，因此越盟要求法国明确地承认三个印度支那国家的‘主权与独立’，这个主张是不能加以反对的。在全面撤退所有外国军队的主张上不能例外地也是如此。”印尼的“民权报”也说：“印度支那的殖民制度应予废除，只有到那时，那里才能建立起持久的和平。”
    皮杜尔虽然嘴里也说可以接受承认印度支那三国主权和独立的主张，但是他却企图把保大等三个政权说成是越南、寮国和高棉三国已经获得了“独立”。这就表明了法国实际上还无意把主权和独立交给印度支那人民，因为谁都知道保大之流不过是法国殖民者维持其殖民统治的工具，现在美国正想把它们从法国手里抓过去。法国著名的拉维尔湼教授就曾说过：保大等三个政权只是靠着法国刺刀才能存在的“纸牌搭成的房子，法国远征军一撤走，它们便立即要坍塌的了。”
    越南民主共和国方案的入情入理，还表现在它不仅主张通过自由普选实现印度支那三国的统一，而且表示印度支那三国可以研究依照自由意志的原则与加入的条件而加入法兰西联邦，并承认法国在这些国家现存的经济与文化利益。法国的“解放报”认为越南民主共和国主张这样地恢复印度支那的和平，显然不是“一种敌人的态度。”
    越南民主共和国提出的得到世界舆论广泛同情的建议，得到中苏两国代表团的支持。中苏两国代表团采取的这个立场和态度，被公众舆论认为是符合千百万爱好和平人民的利益的。
    五月十四日的日内瓦会议上，莫洛托夫外长对越南民主共和国的方案提出了补充，认为可以协议由中立国代表组成委员会来担当监督停战的任务，并且表示，法国主张由参加日内瓦会议的国家提供对于会议上所将达成的协议的保证，在原则上是可以接受的。这样就解除了企图阻挠和平解决印度支那问题的人们的借口，而为达成协议打开了广阔的途径。
    莫洛托夫外长的发言受到各方面的普遍欢迎，甚至英法代表团也不能不承认他的建议已使会议有了进展。连美国国际新闻社驻日内瓦的记者也认为：“莫洛托夫的行动加强了一些欧洲代表的信念，即俄国是真诚热望看到印度支那战争的结束”。巴黎法国电台十五日广播称：“此间的一般情绪是赞成妥协的。在莫洛托夫今天下午发表演讲之后，法国观察家们发现了某些可能导致妥协的迹象，……总而言之，日内瓦会议本周是有进展的。”
    但是，据美联社华盛顿十六日电，杜勒斯却在弗吉尼亚州威廉斯堡发表的一篇演说中再度表明：
  “美国几几乎看不出在印度支那问题上有达成合理解决的任何希望。”
    这不是偶然的。杜勒斯害怕日内瓦会议有任何可能的进展。他目前正在把他的赌注押在将会使“法国迅即提出一个关于美国干涉印度支那战争的具体建议”的新阴谋活动上。这就是为什么世界舆论特别需要提高警惕了。
