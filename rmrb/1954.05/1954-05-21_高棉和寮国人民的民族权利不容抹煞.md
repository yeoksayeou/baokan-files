The national rights of the Khmer and Lao people must not be erased
Feng Zhidan Zhou Xiuqing

    In the process of discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, an extremely unreasonable phenomenon has emerged: Western diplomats, unwilling to acknowledge historical facts and turning a blind eye to real life, are trying to erase the right of the Khmer and Lao people to speak, obstructing the Khmer and Lao resistance governments from sending delegations to participate in the Geneva Conference, and attempting to resolve the Indochina issue without considering the national rights of the Khmer and Lao people. French Foreign Minister Bidault even referred to the people's regimes of these two democratic countries as "ghosts," saying that they simply do not exist. But this French diplomat's intentions are completely futile, because he cannot change the basic fact that these "ghosts" have been engaged in fierce war with the French aggressors for seven or eight years, and the territory of the French aggressors in Khmer and Laos is shrinking more and more.

    Everyone knows that the establishment of these two democratic countries, Khmer and Laos, like the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is an important development in the rising Asian national liberation movement after the end of World War II. The people of the three countries jointly carried out a just struggle against colonial rule and for national independence. Therefore, the Khmer and Lao people, like the Vietnamese people, naturally have the inviolable right to decide their own destiny.

    During World War II, the French colonial authorities, who had subjected the Indochinese people to nearly a century of brutal colonial rule, surrendered in the face of the armed attacks of Japanese militarists; but the Khmer and Lao people, together with the Vietnamese people, rose up to resist the Japanese aggressors and strive to liberate their nations from the hands of the Japanese and French invaders.

    After the surrender of the Japanese fascist aggressors, the Khmer people seized power and declared the independence of their country. However, the French colonialists, instigated by American imperialism, reoccupied the territory of Khmer in September 1945 and forcibly established an anti-people regime in Khmer. However, the increasingly awakened Khmer people were not conquered. In 1946, they formed the Khmer People's Liberation Army. From then on, the Khmer people launched an unprecedented national liberation movement, and a widespread armed struggle unfolded throughout Khmer.

    Due to the development of the Khmer national liberation movement, a major event occurred in the political life of the Khmer people in April 1950: The Khmer National People's Congress, attended by 200 representatives from various Khmer patriotic democratic groups, women, youth, Buddhist monks, and others, was officially convened. The congress elected the Khmer Central People's Liberation Committee, which was later reorganized into the Khmer Resistance Government headed by Chairman Son Ngoc Minh.

    Under the leadership of the Resistance Government, the Khmer national liberation movement has developed even further. In the southwest region alone, the Khmer People's Armed Forces fought more than 500 battles, large and small, against the French aggressors and their puppet forces in 1953. Now, the Khmer liberated areas, guerrilla bases, and guerrilla zones encompass a vast area stretching from the border between Khmer and South Vietnam to the border between Khmer and Thailand. In the fourteen provinces of Khmer, local resistance governments have been gradually established, consolidated, and expanded.

    In Laos, one sees the same situation evolving. The Lao people launched an armed uprising in 1945, seizing power from the Japanese fascists and their colonial tools, and on October 12 of the same year, established the Lao Provisional Resistance Government in Vientiane, solemnly declaring the independence of Laos to the world. King Sisavang Vong signed an abdication document. But then the French aggressors returned and invaded the territory of Laos. The Lao people then rearmed themselves and waged a heroic and tenacious armed struggle to defend their national freedom and independent rights.

    In August 1950, the Lao people convened the Lao People's Congress of Free Laos, attended by more than 100 representatives of all ethnic groups and strata of people from the liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas. The congress elected the Lao Resistance Government headed by Prime Minister Souphanouvong. At the same time, the Lao Free National United Front and its Central Executive Committee were established. The Lao Free National United Front united the national democratic forces, with representatives of 150,000 people from a wide range of national strata participating in the national united front.

    The Lao people, closely united around the Lao Resistance Government and the National United Front, have since won even greater victories in their national liberation struggle. In the spring of 1953, the Lao People's Liberation Army liberated the important area of Sam Neua Province in northern Laos, and this spring successively liberated the Nam Ou River basin, the Bolovens Plateau, and Phongsaly Province. At present, the Lao People's Liberation Army has liberated more than half of the country's territory (the entire territory of Laos is 220,000 square kilometers) and more than one million people, accounting for about half of the total population. Local resistance governments have been established in nine of the ten provinces of Laos.

    Countless facts show that the Khmer and Lao resistance governments have gained the support of the people of both countries, and it is this support that has enabled the resistance governments of both countries to achieve significant victories. The Khmer and Lao resistance governments have also implemented democratic policies in the liberated areas, made significant efforts to transform the country's economy and improve people's living standards, and achieved many remarkable achievements. The resistance governments also attach great importance to the cultural and educational undertakings of the people of both countries. In many liberated areas of Khmer, the literacy rate has reached 70 percent of the total population. In Laos, where 97 percent of the people were illiterate under French occupation, more than 30 percent of the population in the Lao liberated areas can now read and write. The great task of eliminating illiteracy and ignorance is being actively carried out by the people's governments of both countries. Because of all this, the resistance governments of these two countries enjoy a very high prestige among the people.

    As for the anti-people regimes of Khmer and Laos, fostered by the French colonialists and supported by the American interventionists, they have nothing to do with the people of the two countries and are tools of the colonialists imposed on the people. It is enough to cite one fact to illustrate this: King Sisavang Vong of Laos, when announcing his abdication in November 1945, stated: "Agrees to be governed by the new government of Laos, which is established as the true and legitimate government of Laos." Therefore, it is obvious what the actual value of the anti-people regime later fostered by the French colonialists is. In 1949, in order to deceive world opinion and cover up the notorious colonial war, the French colonialists announced the so-called "independence" of the anti-people regimes of the two countries. But even the American bourgeois press, such as "Twentieth Century" magazine, admitted that the puppet show played by the French colonialists was "so false that it could not satisfy anyone."

    It is very clear that only the people's governments of Khmer and Laos are the true defenders of the national rights and democratic life of the people of the two countries; and only they are the true and legitimate representatives of the people of Khmer and Laos.

    The colonialists cannot erase such ironclad historical facts on the battlefield, so how can they cancel them out at the conference table with a few worthless slanders from their diplomats?

    At the Geneva Conference on May 14, Bidault insisted that there was no war of aggression launched by the French colonialists and supported by the American interventionists in Laos and Khmer, and absurdly slandered the so-called "aggression" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against Khmer and Laos. He even wanted to say that the colonial troops of France invading Khmer and Laos were not foreign troops, but instead said that the "only question that needs to be discussed" is the "invasion of the Viet Minh troops."

    However, the true situation in Khmer and Laos cannot be tampered with by the French colonialists. As Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, pointed out: "Not based on facts, not based on the real situation, but only relying on fantasy to say that the national liberation movement and resistance of the Khmer and Lao people is the activity of 'foreign troops,' this is a method of resolving the issue of restoring peace in the three countries of Indochina that is neither based nor realistic."

    Vietnam, Khmer, and Laos on the Indochinese Peninsula are a unified whole geographically, and their national destinies are closely related and they share weal and woe.

    The French colonialists long established the same colonial rule in the three countries of Indochina, and in order to maintain this colonial rule, they treated Indochina as an indivisible colonial battlefield. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the French colonialists invaded Indochina by occupying the southern provinces of Vietnam, then invaded Khmer, and then used Khmer as a springboard to invade all of Vietnam, and finally annexed Laos. Taking the facts that have occurred in the Vietnamese-Lao battlefield in recent years as an example, in 1945, the remnants of the French army retreated into Yunnan Province in China, and then took the opportunity to reoccupy Phongsaly in Laos, and used it as a base to occupy Dien Bien Phu, Lai Chau, and Son La in Vietnam; and then used these places as strongholds to attack Sam Neua in northern Laos, and then invaded Son La, Hoa Binh, Thanh Hoa and the Vietnamese-Lao border in Vietnam. The French aggressors also drove the Bao Dai puppet army to attack Laos, and drove the Lao puppet army to attack Vietnam. Does the French colonialists' military aggression throughout Indochina need more explanation?

    It is precisely based on their historical experience and the common threat they have faced for the past eight years that the people of Vietnam, Khmer, and Laos have closely united in the national liberation war against the French colonialists and American interventionists, opposing their common national enemies. Since 1951, Vietnam, Khmer, and Laos have formed an alliance of the people of the three countries based on common aspirations and common vital interests, and based on the principles of voluntariness, equality, mutual assistance, and mutual respect for sovereignty, striving for the peace, independence, unity, and democracy of the three nations.

    In the heroic resistance war, the Khmer and Lao people, like the Vietnamese people, rose up to fight under the leadership of their respective resistance governments, becoming stronger as they fought. Due to the distribution of ethnic components in the population of the three countries, in the armed organizations in southern Vietnam, Vietnamese and Khmer fought side by side, while in the armed organizations in Khmer, Khmer and Vietnamese also fought side by side. In Laos, there are also small numbers of Vietnamese distributed everywhere, who joined the Lao army from the beginning of the Lao resistance. Therefore, according to this very natural actual development, the French colonialists' attempt to erase the facts and justice of the increasingly strong national liberation movement of the Khmer and Lao people, slander their resistance with the so-called "Viet Minh army invasion," and attempt to use this to write off the resistance armed forces of the Khmer and Lao people, and disregard their national rights, is of course a futile effort.

    As mentioned above, the French colonialists' slanders and lies that the resistance governments of Khmer and Laos are "ghosts" and that the fact of the heroic resistance of the Khmer and Lao people does not exist are self-defeating. The national rights of the Khmer and Lao people cannot be erased, nor can they be erased. The just struggle of the Khmer and Lao people has won the widespread sympathy of the people all over the world. In order for the Geneva Conference to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina widely and objectively, it is necessary to invite representatives of the resistance governments of Laos and Khmer to participate, and the issue of stopping hostilities and restoring peace in these two countries should be resolved based on the national rights of the Khmer and Lao people.

    高棉和寮国人民的民族权利不容抹煞
    冯之丹　周修庆
    在日内瓦会议上讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的过程中，出现了极不合理的现象：那些不甘心承认历史事实并闭眼不看现实生活的西方国家的外交家们，力图抹煞高棉和寮国人民的发言权，阻挠高棉和寮国抗战政府派遣代表团参加日内瓦会议，并企图在解决印度支那问题时不考虑高棉和寮国人民的民族权利。法国外交部长皮杜尔竟把这两个民主国家的人民政权称之为什么“幽灵”，说他们根本不存在。但是这位法国外交家的用心是完全徒劳的，因为他改变不了这样的基本事实：这些“幽灵”已和法国侵略军进行了七、八年激烈的战争，而且在高棉、寮国的国土上，法国侵略军的地盘已越来越缩小了。
    谁都知道，高棉和寮国这两个民主国家的建立，和越南民主共和国一样，乃是第二次世界大战结束以后日益高涨的亚洲民族解放运动中的重要发展。三国人民共同进行了反抗殖民统治，争取民族独立的正义斗争。因此，高棉和寮国人民自然和越南人民一样都有不可侵犯的权利来决定他们自己的命运。
    在第二次世界大战期间，对印度支那人民实行了将近一世纪的暴虐的殖民统治的法国殖民当局，在日本军国主义者的武装进攻面前投了降；但高棉和寮国人民与越南人民一道奋起抗击日本侵略者，争取把自己的民族从日、法侵略者手中解放出来。
    在日本法西斯侵略者投降以后，高棉人民夺取了政权，宣布了他们的国家的独立。但是，法国殖民者于一九四五年九月在美帝国主义的唆使下，重新侵占了高棉的领土，并用武力建立了高棉反人民的政权。然而日益觉醒了的高棉人民并没有被征服，他们在一九四六年成立了高棉人民解放军，从那时起高棉人民掀起了空前规模的民族解放运动，高棉全国都展开了广泛的武装斗争。
    由于高棉民族解放运动的发展，一九五○年四月在高棉人民的政治生活中发生了一个重大的事件：由高棉各爱国民主团体、妇女、青年、佛教僧侣等二百名代表参加的高棉全国人民代表大会正式召开了。大会选出了高棉中央人民解放委员会，后来便改组成为以山玉明主席为首的高棉抗战政府。
    在抗战政府的领导下，高棉民族解放运动有了更大的发展。高棉人民武装部队仅仅于一九五三年在西南地区，就和法国侵略军及其傀儡武装进行了大小五百余次的战斗。现在高棉的解放区、游击根据地及游击区已包括从高棉和南越交界处直伸到高棉、泰国边界的一个广阔地区。在高棉全国十四个省中，地方抗战政权已逐步地建立、巩固和扩大起来。
    在寮国，人们看到同样的形势演进着。寮国人民在一九四五年举行了武装起义，他们从日本法西斯及其殖民工具手中夺取了政权，并于同年十月十二日在万象成立了寮国临时抗战政府，庄严地向全世界宣告了寮国的独立，国王西萨望·汪并签署了退位书。但是接着法国侵略军卷土重来，侵入了寮国的领土。寮国人民便重新拿起武器为保卫自己的民族自由与独立权利而进行英勇顽强的武装斗争。
    一九五○年八月寮国人民召开了自由寮国人民代表大会，出席的有来自解放区和敌占区中的各族人民和各阶层人民的代表一百余人。大会选出了以苏发努冯总理为首的寮国抗战政府。同时并成立了寮国自由民族统一战线和它的中央执行委员会。寮国自由民族统一战线团结了全国民主力量，有十五万全国广泛阶层的代表参加了民族统一战线。
    寮国人民紧密地团结在寮国抗战政府和民族统一战线的周围，寮国人民的民族解放斗争从此取得了更巨大的胜利。一九五三年春天，寮国人民解放军解放了寮北的重要地区桑怒省，今年春天又相继解放了南乌江流域、波罗芬高原和封萨里省。目前寮国人民解放军已解放了二分之一以上的国土（寮国全境为二十二万平方公里）及一百万以上的人民，约占全部人口的一半。在寮国十个省份中已有九个省份建立了地方抗战政府。
    无数事实表明，高棉和寮国抗战政府获得了两国人民的支持，正是这种支持使两国抗战政府取得了重大的胜利。高棉和寮国抗战政府并在解放区实施了民主政策，为改造国家的经济和提高人民生活水平而进行了重大的努力，取得了许多显著的成就。抗战政府还十分重视两国人民的文化教育事业，在高棉的许多解放区里，识字的人已达到了全部人口的百分之七十。在寮国，原先在法国占领时有百分之九十七的人民是文盲，而目前在寮国解放区已有百分之三十以上的人口能读能写了。消灭文盲和愚昧的伟大工作正由两国人民政权积极地进行中。由于这一切，就使这两国的抗战政府在人民中享有很高的威信。
    至于说到由法国殖民者扶殖起来、并得到美国干涉者所支持的高棉和寮国反人民的政权，与两国人民无关，是被强加在人民头上的殖民者的工具。只要举出这样一个事实就够说明这一点：寮国国王西萨望·汪在一九四五年十一月间宣告退位时已声明：“同意受寮国新政府的管辖，这个政府是作为真正的和合法的寮国政府而建立的”。因此，后来再由法国殖民者扶植起来的反人民的政权，其实际价值如何是很显然的了。一九四九年，法国殖民者为了欺骗世界舆论，掩盖臭名远扬的殖民战争，宣布两国反人民的政权的所谓“独立”。但是法国殖民者所扮演的傀儡剧，就连美国资产阶级报刊如“二十世纪”杂志也承认：“法国建议的‘独立’是如此虚假，以致它不可能使任何人感到满意。”
    非常明显，只有高棉和寮国的人民政权才是两国人民的民族权利与民主生活的真正的维护者；也只有它们才是高棉和寮国人民的真正的合法的代表者。
    对于这样铁一般的历史事实，殖民者无法在战场上加以抹煞，又怎能在会议桌上用他们的外交家的几句不值一文的谰言而加以勾销呢？
    在五月十四日的日内瓦会议上，皮杜尔硬说在寮国和高棉并不存在由法国殖民者所发动而由美国干涉者所支持的侵略战争，并荒谬地诬蔑越南民主共和国对高棉和寮国的所谓“侵略”。他居然想把法国侵入高棉、寮国的殖民军队说成不是外国军队，反而说什么“唯一需要讨论的问题”竟是“越盟军队的侵入”问题。
    然而，高棉、寮国两国的真实情况，是法国殖民者所不能纂改的。正如越南民主共和国首席代表范文同代外长所指出的：“不依据事实，不依据现实情况，只凭幻想说高棉、寮国人民的民族解放运动与抗战是‘外国军队’的活动，这是解决在印度支那三国恢复和平问题中的一种既无基础又不切实际的办法。”
    印度支那半岛上的越南、高棉、寮国三个国家在地理上是一个统一的整体，在民族命运上休戚相关，患难与共。
    法国殖民者曾长期地在印度支那三个国家中建立同样的殖民统治，并为了保持这个殖民统治，把印度支那作为不可分割的殖民战场。十九世纪后半世纪，法国殖民者侵入印度支那就是以占领越南南部的省份开始，继即侵入高棉，又以高棉为跳板，进而侵占全部越南，最后并吞了寮国。就以近几年来越、寮战场所发生的事实来说，一九四五年，法国残军曾溃退入中国云南省，后又乘机重占寮国的封萨里，并以此为基地占领了越南的奠边府、莱州和山萝；又以这些地方为据点进攻寮北的桑怒，然后又进犯越南的山萝、和平、清化和越寮边境。法国侵略军也曾驱使保大伪军进攻寮国，驱使寮国伪军进攻越南。法国殖民者在整个印度支那所实行的军事侵略，难道还需要有更多的说明吗？
    越南、高棉和寮国人民正是基于他们的历史经验和八年来所面临的共同威胁，才在反抗法国殖民者与美国干涉者的民族解放战争中紧密地团结起来，反对他们共同的民族敌人。自一九五一年起，越南、高棉和寮国形成了以共同愿望和共同切身权益为基础，以自愿、平等、互助与互相尊重主权为原则的三国人民的联盟，争取三个民族的和平、独立、统一与民主。
    在英勇的抗战中，高棉和寮国人民与越南人民一样，在各自的抗战政府的领导下奋起作战，越战越强。由于三国人口中民族成分的分布，在越南南部的武装组织中，有越南人与高棉人并肩作战，而在高棉的武装组织中也有高棉人与越南人并肩作战。在寮国，也到处都分布着一小部分的越南人，他们自寮国抗战之日起就加入了寮国军队。因此，根据这一十分自然的实际发展情况，法国殖民者企图抹煞高棉和寮国人民日益壮大的民族解放运动的事实及其正义性，诬蔑他们的抗战中有所谓“越盟军队入侵”的问题，并企图借此勾销高棉和寮国人民的抗战武装，无视他们的民族权利，这当然是枉费心机的。
    如上所述，法国殖民者所谓高棉、寮国的抗战政府是“幽灵”，所谓高棉和寮国人民的英勇抗战这一事实并不存在的这类诽谤和谎言，是不攻自破的。高棉和寮国人民的民族权利是不容抹煞，也不可能被抹煞的。高棉和寮国人民的正义斗争已得到了全世界人民的广泛同情。日内瓦会议为了能够广泛地和客观地讨论在印度支那恢复和平的问题，有必要邀请寮国和高棉两国抗战政府的代表参加，并应根据高棉和寮国人民的民族权利来解决在这两国境内停止敌对行动和恢复和平的问题。
