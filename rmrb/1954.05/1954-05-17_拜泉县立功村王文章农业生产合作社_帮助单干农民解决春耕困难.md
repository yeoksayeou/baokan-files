    Wang Wenzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiquan County Helps Individual Farmers Overcome Difficulties in Spring Planting
    The Wang Wenzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licun Village, Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, has greatly influenced the surrounding farmers by helping individual farmer Lü Zhensheng solve the difficulties in spring planting.
    After the Wang Wenzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative was established this spring, the members divided the work of digging manure, transporting manure, and engaging in sideline occupations, working enthusiastically. The brothers Lü Zhensheng, individual farmers in the village, were secretly working hard, wanting to compete with the cooperative. In early March, the two brothers drove four horses to buy thatching grass, planning to sell it at a high price when building houses and make a profit. On the way home, Lü Laoer drove the cart too "wildly," and the elder brother Lü Zhensheng went up to grab him. Unexpectedly, the cart overturned, crushing Lü Zhensheng unconscious on the ground, and Lü Laoer's arm was broken. Wang Wenzhang, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, was leading the members in chopping straw at the time. Upon hearing that the Lü brothers had overturned the cart, he led the members to carry the Lü Zhensheng brothers to Shuangyang Town Hospital for treatment overnight.
    With planting season approaching, the Lü Zhensheng brothers were particularly anxious in the hospital, worried that they would not be able to plant their land. At that time, Wang Wenzhang was discussing this matter with the cooperative members. Some members advocated ignoring them, saying: Letting him miss one planting season will educate him! Some members said: Our cooperative has many people and great strength. We should unite with him and help him plant his land, which will demonstrate the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative. The members all agreed with this opinion and sent a message to the Lü Zhensheng brothers to reassure them to recuperate. A few days later, three cooperative members went to Lü Zhensheng's home and chopped six hundred bundles of horse grass for them, and helped them plant two *xiang* of wheat. Now they are helping them plant the large fields.
    Recently, when the Lü Zhensheng brothers returned from the hospital, they were extremely moved to see that their land had indeed been planted, and expressed their intention to join the cooperative in the fall.

    拜泉县立功村王文章农业生产合作社
    帮助单干农民解决春耕困难
    黑龙江省拜泉县立功村王文章农业生产合作社帮助单干农户吕振生解决春耕中的困难，对周围农民影响很好。
    王文章农业生产合作社在今春成立后，社员们分工刨粪、送粪、搞副业，干的热火朝天。本村的单干户吕振生哥俩暗地使劲，要和社比赛比赛。三月初，他们哥俩赶着四匹马拉车出去买盖房草，准备等盖房时高价卖出赚一笔钱。在回家的道上，吕老二把车赶“毛”了，老大吕振生上去就抓。不料车翻了，把吕振生轧昏在地上，吕老二被轧断了一只胳膊。农业生产合作社主任王文章这时正领着社员们铡草，听说吕家兄弟翻了车，便领着社员连夜把吕振生哥俩抬到双阳镇医院治疗。
    快要种地了，吕振生哥俩在医院里特别着急，担心自己的地种不上了。当时，王文章正和社员们讨论这件事。有的社员主张不管，他们说：扔他一回地，就把他教育过来啦！有的社员说：咱们社人多力量大，应当团结他，帮助他把地种上，那才显出农业生产合作社的优越性。社员们都同意这个意见，就捎信叫吕振生哥俩安心休养。过了几天，社里去了三个社员给吕振生家铡了六百捆马草，并帮助他们种了两垧小麦。现在正在帮助他们种大田。
    最近，吕振生哥俩从医院回来，看见自己的地真的种上了，异常感动，表示秋天一定入社。
