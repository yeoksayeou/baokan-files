    Seventeen mu of potatoes newly planted this spring in the Huai River area of Anhui Province are mostly growing well. The broad masses of farmers are continuing field management with full confidence, striving for a bumper harvest of the first season of potatoes.
    The Huai River basin is an area prone to drought and flooding. In order to reduce water and drought disasters, the change to planting potatoes is an important measure for reforming agricultural production in the area. Party and government leaders at all levels attach great importance to this work. Not long after the potatoes were sown, wireworms once occurred in some areas. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Department of Agriculture of the Anhui Provincial People's Government successively issued instructions and notices on checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, and eliminating pests, requiring all localities to immediately take effective measures to lead the masses in eliminating them. In the Su County area, wireworms occurred in approximately 30,000 mu of potato fields. After cadres led the masses to eliminate them with "666" powder and various methods, the normal growth of the potato seedlings was ensured. Counties such as Su County, Wuhe, Lingbi, and Sihong have also successively held county-wide meetings of township cadres, agricultural production cooperative heads, and mutual aid team leaders to impart field management techniques such as pesticide application and seedling replanting.
    After this series of field management work, large swathes of thriving potato seedlings have appeared everywhere in the Huai River area, generally growing to five or six inches high, and potato tubers have generally begun to form. At present, farmers in various places have actively transitioned to the second stage of potato field management, which includes topdressing, earthing up, and cultivating.

    安徽省沿淮地区十七万亩马铃薯生长良好
    安徽省沿淮地区今春改种的近十七万亩马铃薯，绝大部分生长良好，广大农民正满怀信心地继续进行田间管理，争取第一季马铃薯丰收。
    淮河流域是多旱多涝的地区。为了减少水旱灾害，改种马铃薯是改革该地区农业生产的一项重要措施，各级党政领导方面对此工作极为重视。在马铃薯下种后不久，部分地区曾一度发生金针虫为害，中共安徽省委及安徽省人民政府农业厅相继发出关于查苗补苗和扑灭虫害的指示和通知，要各地马上采取有效措施，领导群众进行扑灭。宿县专区约有三万亩马铃薯地曾发生金针虫，经过干部率领群众用“六六六”药粉及各种办法扑灭下去，保证了薯苗的正常生长。宿县、五河、灵璧、泗洪等县还先后召开全县乡干部及农业生产合作社长、互助组长等会议，传授了除药补苗等田间管理技术。
    通过这一系列的田间管理工作后，沿淮地带，到处出现了大片茁壮的马铃薯苗，一般已长到五、六寸高，并已普遍开始结薯块。目前各地农民已积极转入马铃薯田间管理第二阶段的追肥、培土、中耕等工作。
