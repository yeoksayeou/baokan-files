　　Setting up Retail Departments at Construction Sites

　　The stores under the Lüda Municipal Company of the China National Department Store are actively setting up retail departments at basic construction sites to supply daily necessities needed by workers. Previously, at construction sites far from the market, workers often had to walk seven or eight li to buy something. The establishment of retail departments at construction sites by the department store has been warmly welcomed by the workers. A retail department at a certain construction site sold more than 200 gray blankets in less than two hours. Items such as large-size water socks, low-priced razor blades, and goggles also sold quickly. Now, the Lüda Municipal Department Store is actively organizing sources of goods and trying to meet the needs of the workers.

　　Inviting User Departments to Visit Stocked Goods

　　In order to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient contact with user departments, which often led to situations where there were goods without owners or owners without goods, the Henan Provincial Branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company invited purchasing personnel from major factories, mines, and basic construction units in Zhengzhou City and nearby special districts to visit the stocked goods in April. Through this visit, the factories, mines, and basic construction units understood the inventory situation of the Hardware and Machinery Company, which greatly helped both parties improve procurement and supply work. For example, cadres from the Zhengzhou Postal and Telecommunications Bureau saw a large quantity of bamboo steel in the warehouse and said, "We didn't know you had these materials in the past, and we always had to go to Hankou to prepare materials. Because of piecemeal transportation, it wastes manpower and increases costs. We will purchase from you in the future." In addition, various units put forward opinions on the shortcomings of the company's operations; some units also suggested that the company should expand the variety of goods it handles according to their needs. At present, the company is studying ways to further improve the supply work based on the opinions put forward by various units.

　　Preparing Summer Harvest Farm Tools Early

　　Last year, when supplying summer harvest farm tools, the Changge County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province initially planned too little, which led to a stock-out before the wheat harvest. Later, they hurriedly ordered more goods, but by the time the goods arrived, the wheat harvest was over, resulting in a backlog.

　　This year, the county's supply and marketing cooperative learned from this lesson and began organizing sources of summer harvest farm tools in March. In April, it also convened a meeting of the directors, planners, and statisticians of the various district cooperatives, and formulated a supply plan based on the farmers' needs for wheat harvest production materials. In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, the county cooperative federation dispatched twelve cadres to go to the countryside with the cadres of the grassroots cooperatives to organize iron and wood processing production. More than 30 handicraft production groups have been organized in the county's iron, wood, and other industries to actively rush to produce summer harvest farm tools. Farm tools such as brooms purchased from Anhui and other places are being transferred.

　　Advance Allocation of Lump Coal to Supply Tobacco Farmers

　　In order to support tobacco farmer production, the Shandong Provincial Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company has allocated lump coal for tobacco curing to various tobacco-producing areas in advance. At present, the lump coal allocated to Yidu, Weixian, Changle and other famous tobacco-producing areas in the province can fully meet the needs of local tobacco farmers for tobacco curing. When allocating lump coal, the company also adopted the method of allocating good and substandard varieties in proportion, so that high-priced and low-priced lump coal were evenly transported to the tobacco-curing areas. Local tobacco farmers can use a mixture of good and substandard lump coal to cure tobacco in order to reduce costs.

　　Mountainous Area Pack Animal Teams

　　LingLe County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province is a mountainous county where Zhuang and Yao people live in mountainous areas. This area has abundant local specialties such as star anise, tung fruit, tea oil, and tree ears. Due to the high mountains, long roads, and inconvenient transportation, local specialties here often cannot be sold, and the production and living supplies needed by the people of all ethnic groups are not easy to buy.

　　At the beginning of the spring plowing season this year, the LingLe County National Trade Company organized a pack animal team of 330 horses to go deep into the remote mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities to supply farm tools, salt, cotton cloth, and other items, and to purchase local specialties. Now, these pack animal teams have supplied more than 2,700 farm tools, more than 200,000 jin of salt, and a large amount of cotton cloth and cotton yarn, and have also purchased local specialties worth more than 358 million yuan, helping the brotherly ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas solve some of the difficulties in production and life during the spring plowing season.

　　Forest Area Workers Live Like City Dwellers

　　Since the establishment of state-owned local product stores in the four forest areas of Dashitou, Huangnihe, Tianqiaoling, and Wangqing in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, the lives of the workers have been significantly improved. In the past, it was difficult for forest area workers to eat fresh meat and vegetables. Since the summer of last year, workers here have not only eaten fresh vegetables such as cucumbers, celery, kidney beans, and garlic sprouts, as well as meat, fish, and eggs, but also fresh watermelons and cantaloupes, as well as peanuts from western Liaoning and mandarin oranges from Guangdong. Now, workers in the Dunhua forest area can eat fresh fish and meat in the canteen at any time; they can also eat fruits such as apples and pears after meals. Many workers say, "We really live like we live in the city!"

　　Harbin Linen Arrives in Guangxi

　　Just as the people of Guangxi Province are about to purchase summer clothes, linen produced in Harbin has been transported to Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin and other places.

　　This batch of linen is a product of the first modern linen factory in China, the Harbin Linen Factory, which started production in 1952. This kind of cloth is strong and durable, very suitable for summer wear, especially suitable for subtropical areas. At present, there are two types of linen bleached cloth transported to Guangxi Province: one is all-linen bleached cloth, and the other is cotton and linen blended bleached cloth. These linen bleached cloths can be made into various shirts, underpants, curtains, tablecloths and other items.

　　Guangdong Fruits to be Shipped to Various Places Soon

　　The fruit season in Guangdong Province has arrived. At present, lychees, bananas, fragrant bananas, pineapples, peaches, plums, plums and other fruits have been launched on the market one after another. Guangdong's famous fruit "March Red" lychee is another bumper harvest this year, and it is estimated that it can produce about 100,000 dan, which is more than double the output of last year. At present, state-owned food companies, cooperative federations, etc. are vigorously purchasing. The Guangzhou Municipal Cooperative Federation plans to purchase 30,000 dan of "March Red" lychees. In addition to meeting the needs of the city's people, 15,000 dan will be transported and sold to large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Hangzhou, and Changsha. It is estimated that the production of fragrant bananas this year can reach 400,000 dan; the output of pineapples can be doubled compared with last year.

　　Let People Who Come to Lushan Enjoy Their Summer Vacation

　　The hot summer is coming, and many working people from all over the country will come to Lushan for summer vacation. The state-owned commercial departments in the Jiujiang Special District of Jiangxi Province are actively preparing various non-staple foods and summer supplies for people on summer vacation and recuperation. The amount of meat, such as pork, beef, and fresh fish, and aquatic products to be supplied this year will be nearly doubled compared with last year; fruits such as watermelons, bananas, pears, and apples are being prepared in large quantities, and 60,000 jin of watermelons alone will be supplied. The commercial departments have also made full preparations for wool sweaters and blankets, steel pots and vegetable basins, which are suitable for the Lushan climate, as well as milk powder, coffee, beer, soda, tea, cod liver oil, and commonly used medicines.

    更好地为生产和消费者服务
      在工地设立门市部
    中国百货公司旅大市公司所属各商店积极到基本建设工地设立门市部，供应工人需要的日用百货。以前，在离市集较远的工地，工人们要买点东西，往往要走七、八里地才能买到。百货公司在工地设立了门市部，受到工人热烈欢迎。某工地门市部拿去二百多床灰毯子，不到两小时就卖完了；大号水袜子、价格较低的刮脸刀片、风镜等物品，都销售得很快。现在，旅大市百货公司正积极组织货源，设法满足工人的需要。
      邀请用货部门参观库存商品
    中国五金机械公司河南省分公司为了克服和用货部门联系不够密切，以致时常发生有货无主或有主无货的缺点，在四月间邀请郑州市及附近专区各主要厂矿和基本建设单位采购人员参观了库存商品。通过这次参观，各厂矿和基本建设单位了解了五金机械公司的库存情况，对双方改进采购和供应工作都有很大帮助。如郑州邮电局的干部看到仓库中有大批竹节钢，便说：“过去不知道你们有这些物资，备料总得跑到汉口去。因为零星运输，既浪费了人力，成本也高。今后从你们这里进货就好了。”另外，各单位对该公司经营中的缺点提出了意见；有些单位还根据自己的需要，提出了该公司应该扩大经营的品种。目前，该公司正根据各单位提出的意见，研究进一步改进供应工作的办法。
      及早准备夏收农具
    河南省长葛县供销合作社去年供应夏收农具时，开始因为计划太小，麦收以前就发生了脱销现象；后来又赶紧订货，等到货物运到，麦收已完，结果又造成积压。
    今年，该县供销合作社接受了这个教训，在三月间就着手组织夏收农具货源。四月间又召开了各区社主任、计划员、统计员会议，根据农民对麦收生产资料的需要，订出了供应计划。为了保证计划的实现，县合作社联合社抽出干部十二人，和各基层合作社的干部一起下乡组织铁业、木业等加工生产。全县铁业、木业等行业已组织了三十多个手工业生产小组，积极赶制夏收农具。从安徽等地采购的扫帚等农具正在调运。
    提前调拨块煤供应烟农
    中国煤业建筑器材公司山东省公司为扶持烟农生产，提前向各产烟区调拨烤烟用的块煤。目前，调拨到该省著名产烟区——益都、潍县、昌乐等地的块煤，已可充分满足当地烟农烤烟的需要。该公司在调拨块煤时，还采用了好、次品种按比例调拨的办法，使高价和低价的块煤均衡地调运到烤烟区。各地烟农可使用好、次品种混合块煤烤烟，以便降低成本。
      山区的马驮队
    广西省桂西僮族自治区凌乐县，是一个多山的县份，山区地带居住着僮族和瑶族人民。这里有丰富的八角、桐果、茶油、木耳等土特产。由于山高路远，交通不便，这里的土特产品常销不出去，各族人民需要的生产和生活用品又不容易买到。
    凌乐县民族贸易公司在今年春耕开始的时候，就组织了三百三十匹马的马驮队，深入少数民族居住的偏僻山区，供应农具、食盐、棉布等物品，收购当地的土特产品。现在，这些马驮队已经供应了二千七百余件农具、二十多万斤食盐及大批棉布和棉纱，同时收购了总值三亿五千八百多万元的土特产品，帮助山区兄弟民族解决了春耕期间生产和生活上的一些困难。
    林区工人生活像城市里一样
    吉林省敦化县大石头、黄泥河、天桥岭、汪清等四个林区，自从设立了国营土产商店以来，工人们的生活有了显著的改善。过去林区工人很难吃到新鲜的肉食和蔬菜，自从去年夏季以来，这里的工人不仅吃到了新鲜的黄瓜、芹菜、芸豆、蒜毫等蔬菜和肉、鱼、蛋类，而且吃到了新鲜的西瓜和甜瓜，以及辽西的花生和广东的蜜柑橘。现在，敦化林区的工人随时可以在食堂里吃到新鲜的鱼、肉；饭后还可以吃到苹果、梨等水果。许多工人都说：“我们真像生活在城市里一样！”
      哈尔滨的亚麻布到了广西
    广西省的人民正要置办夏装的时候，哈尔滨出产的亚麻布运到了南宁、柳州、桂林等地。
    这批亚麻布是一九五二年开工生产的我国第一座近代化亚麻工厂——哈尔滨亚麻厂的产品。这种布坚固耐用，很适合夏季穿用，特别是适用于亚热带地区。现在，运到广西省的亚麻漂白布有两种：一种是全部麻质的亚麻漂白布，一种是棉麻交织的漂白布。这些亚麻漂白布可以制成各种衬衣、衬裤、窗帘、台布等物品。
    广东水果即将运送各地
    广东省水果盛产季节已到。目前荔枝、大蕉、香蕉、菠萝、桃、李、梅等水果均已陆续上市。广东省著名水果“三月红”荔枝今年又是大丰收，估计可产十万担左右，比去年增产一倍多。现国营食品公司、合作总社等正大力进行收购。广州市合作总社计划收购“三月红”荔枝三万担，除满足本市人民需要外，将有一万五千担运销到北京、上海、汉口、杭州、长沙等大中城市。估计今年大蕉生产可达四十万担；菠萝产量可比去年增加一倍。

    让到庐山的人们愉快地避暑
    炎夏就要降临，各地将有许多劳动人民到庐山避暑。江西省九江专区的国营商业部门已在积极为避暑休养的人们准备各种副食品和夏令用品。今年准备供应的猪肉、牛肉、鲜鱼等肉食和水产品的数量，将比去年增加近一倍；西瓜、香蕉、梨、苹果等水果正在大量准备，仅西瓜一项，就要供应六万斤。对适合庐山气候的羊毛衫和羊毛毯，钢精锅、菜盆，以及奶粉、咖啡、啤酒、汽水、茶叶和鱼肝油、常用药品等，商业部门也都作了充分的准备。
