    The work of the Harbin Railway Audit (Supervisory) Bureau was established on the basis of the supervisory work of the China Changchun Railway. After the establishment of the jointly managed Sino-Soviet China Changchun Railway Company, in view of the rather chaotic management methods and systems of Chinese railways at that time, and the low political, ideological, and professional levels of cadres, there was an urgent need to strengthen supervision of enterprises. Based on the advanced experience of the Soviet state supervision system and combined with the specific conditions of China's railways, the Supervisory Board and its working body—the Audit Bureau—were established in May 1950. From May 1950 to the end of 1952, the Audit Bureau, solely through ex-ante and ex-post inspections, uncovered losses and waste caused by theft of materials, false reporting of production achievements, violations of staffing discipline, regulations, and unplanned or over-planned expenditures, totaling over 62.4 billion yuan; disagreed with payments of invoices totaling over 24.2 billion yuan; recovered various losses and debts amounting to approximately 37 billion yuan; and the various suggestions made during the review of production and financial plans and staffing drafts saved the state a significant amount of financial, human, and material resources. For example, in just over two years, it suggested reducing 6,248 redundant personnel, saving an annual total wage of over 18.5 billion yuan.
    Starting in 1953, after the China Changchun Railway was transferred to China, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, in order to consolidate and promote this advanced experience, established the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau on the basis of the organization and operations of the original China Changchun Railway Company Supervisory Board and Audit Bureau. It is directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways and conducts comprehensive supervision of the Harbin Railway Administration system and the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory (now under the jurisdiction of the First Ministry of Machine Building). In 1953, through ex-ante and ex-post supervision, the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau prevented unreasonable expenditures of over 15.29 billion yuan; uncovered off-book materials, black treasuries, black warehouses, unplanned or over-planned construction expenditures, waste, false reporting, embezzlement, theft, and other incidents, amounting to over 62.2 billion yuan; uncovered various losses and debts totaling over 5.2 billion yuan, of which over 4.2 billion yuan has been recovered through efforts; and, based on inspection data, suggested reducing 4,097 redundant personnel, saving an annual wage of over 2.29 billion yuan. The supervisory work during the China Changchun Railway and Harbin Railway periods not only uncovered the above-mentioned problems, preventing and avoiding many losses of state assets, but also educated and improved the level of cadres in managing socialist enterprises and helped improve the management of enterprises. Currently, the broad masses of workers and staff in various units of the Harbin Railway have generally established the concept of strictly adhering to financial systems and implementing planned management and economic accounting, and have enhanced their sense of responsibility for cherishing state property. This provides an important guarantee for the railway bureau to complete and overfulfill production and financial plans, reduce overspending and waste, and accumulate funds for the state.
    The bureau's ability to achieve the above results is inseparable from the following important experiences:
    1. Clear and Specific Tasks
    The Harbin Railway Audit Bureau has a mature working regulation as the legal basis for its supervisory business activities. This regulation was drafted in accordance with the working regulations of the original China Changchun Railway Audit Bureau; and the working regulations of the China Changchun Railway Audit Bureau were formulated based on the advanced experience of Soviet supervisory work and combined with the actual conditions of China's railways. In addition to stipulating that the basic task of the Audit Bureau is to conduct ex-ante and ex-post supervision of the income, expenditure, storage, statistics, and management of state assets of various units of the Harbin Railway and the two factories, this regulation also specifies in detail the responsibilities of the Audit Bureau. This not only enables it to have something to follow in its work, facilitating the work, but also clarifies that the supervisory authority can only make suggestions for improving work based on the problems revealed in the supervision and inspection, and never replace administrative solutions or handle any problems, thus delineating the responsibilities of the supervisory authority and the supervised units, and ensuring the unity of enterprise command. In order to ensure the completion of the responsibilities of the supervisory authority, the regulations also stipulate the supervisory authority's powers: the chief auditor has the right to conduct planned or sudden inspections of the supervised units; when conducting supervision and inspection work, administrative personnel at all levels must provide relevant statistical data, various documents, and written explanations; expenditures of various units cannot be paid temporarily without the consent of the audit personnel, and must be reported to the higher level for resolution, and can only be paid after being discussed and approved by the higher-level authorities and the supervisory authority; the chief auditor's opinion is the final decision for resolving all disputes... etc. This powerfully guarantees the smooth progress of supervisory work.
    2. Guarantee of an Organized System
    The Harbin Railway Audit Bureau is directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways, and with an independent, vertical organizational system, it establishes line audit offices in various railway branch bureaus and sends resident auditors to various grassroots units to supervise the Harbin Railway Administration system and the two factories. The supervisory authority sends its cadres directly to various enterprise departments to carry out supervisory tasks, which enables the supervisory personnel to be free from the constraints of the supervised units, free from the influence of departmentalism and localism, dispel various concerns, adhere to national interests, and fight against all undesirable phenomena that violate national interests. This is because some agencies and staff often have departmentalism and localism; some enterprise leaders have a lenient attitude towards the shortcomings and mistakes of lower-level personnel; some comrades themselves have bureaucratic styles, and not only do they not self-criticize their shortcomings and mistakes in their work, but they also defend their mistakes; in addition, there are indeed many mistakes of units and staff that are inseparable from the mistakes of the leadership. Therefore, only when the supervisory personnel are free from the constraints of the supervised units can they better and more effectively exert the role and strength of supervisory work.
    The supervisory work experience of the China Changchun Railway and the Harbin Railway for more than three years has fully demonstrated the advantages of an independent, vertical organizational structure. For example, in October 1952, the chief of the Ang'angxi Engineering Section signed an agreement with a factory without the approval of the higher authorities and the consent of the resident auditor, using labor from the line maintenance plan to manufacture the factory's heating pipes; the received engineering fees were not turned over to the accounting department for accounting, but were stored in the trade union, attempting to conceal them from the higher authorities and use them as the unit's private fund, which seriously violated the state's financial system. The resident auditor in the Ang'angxi area repeatedly suggested verbally and in writing to the section chief to correct the mistake, but the section chief not only did not accept the suggestion, but used the money to buy a radio. Due to the supervisory personnel's adherence to principles, this behavior that violated the state's financial system was finally corrected. If the supervisory personnel were cadres of this unit and were led by this unit, then they would not easily carry out this principled struggle against the person in charge of this unit.
    At the same time, the independent, vertical organizational structure is streamlined and flexible, with centralized leadership, close ties between higher and lower levels, and a comprehensive and timely grasp of the situation, which facilitates command. Therefore, although the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau currently has only 154 staff members, it can play a significant supervisory role over the Harbin Railway Administration system with more than 100,000 employees and the two locomotive and rolling stock factories.
    3. A Set of Scientific Supervision Methods
    The Audit Bureau realizes its supervisory tasks over the income, expenditure, storage, statistics of state assets, and the management of enterprises through regular and planned supervision and inspection of the formulation, implementation, and summary of production and financial plans, aiming at discovering or preventing problems in a timely manner. Its main working methods are as follows:
    (1) Review of Production and Financial Plans
    According to the provisions of the China Changchun Railway Company's articles of association, the draft annual production and financial plan of the Administration Bureau should be submitted to the Supervisory Board for review before being sent to the higher level for review and approval, and the Supervisory Board should make suggestions. In reviewing the draft annual plan, the Supervisory Board must grasp the development of the national economic construction and the economic conditions along the railway line, according to the state's requirements for the railway (control figures from the higher level) and the figures of the previous year's plan and actual completion, as well as the railway's existing technical equipment, the technical capabilities that may be added in the future, and the potential that can be tapped within the railway (employee inventions, rationalization proposals, labor competitions, etc.)... it should conduct detailed analysis and research on various production indicators, income, expenditures, and profit accumulation in the plan, point out the shortcomings in the plan, and make reasonable and feasible suggestions. If it is found that various production indicators in the draft plan do not meet the requirements of the entire national economic plan; it is found that the total output value, labor plan, and wage plan are not based on fully utilizing the railway's internal resources and production equipment capacity; or it is found that the impact of rationalization proposals on technical operations is not considered, which affects the reasonable improvement of labor productivity; and it is found that the plan is compiled simply from the conditions of a certain day, month, or quarter, planned according to the arithmetic average, and not based on the advanced average quota as the basis of the plan, the Supervisory Board should immediately point it out and make reasonable suggestions. If it is found that the plan is repeated and mislisted, the description does not match the numbers in the plan table, the plan is omitted, and too much expenditure is listed in other items without explanation, the Supervisory Board should also point it out and make practical and feasible suggestions. Through such a serious review of the draft annual production and financial plan, it not only improves the level of work, saves expenditures, and increases profits, but also plays a significant role in promoting the improvement of the railway's planning work.
    (2) Daily Supervision
    The Harbin Railway Administration system currently has 1,380 economic accounting, accounting finalization, and reimbursement business units of various sizes. The Audit Bureau has stationed resident auditors in 340 larger units to conduct daily supervision work. Daily supervision is carried out by resident auditors who, according to national policies and regulations and production and financial plans, conduct ex-ante reviews of all documents and receipts of various cash receipts and expenditures, sales and orders of goods, and the signing of contracts and agreements of enterprise units' production and financial transaction activities. Review whether these transaction activities are in line with the plan, whether they meet the principles of necessity, possibility, and economy; review who promulgated the plan for the relevant expenditures, and whether the various appropriations are needed for production and work. These transaction activities cannot be carried out without the consent of the resident auditor. Daily supervision is not only limited to the review of receipts, but also must be good at actively relying on the Party organization, organizing and leading non-production auditors (people's supervision correspondents), and going deep into the workshops to check production progress and technical indicators, and understand from the production process whether various expenditures are reasonable and necessary. If a shortcoming is found in a certain work, the person in charge of the unit is given suggestions for improvement; if it is found that a certain accounting subject is approaching the planned quota, the head of the unit and the chief accountant are reminded to pay attention, and they are assisted in studying ways to prevent overspending.
    The implementation of daily supervision in enterprises has resulted in the establishment of a new atmosphere in various enterprise units. First of all, the heads of enterprise units have realized their responsibility for state property and must never arbitrarily spend according to their subjective wishes, causing undue losses to state property. Especially in units with unsound planned management and various systems, it further promotes and helps the heads and accounting personnel to adhere to various systems and improve the management situation, and strengthens their overall national concept and concept of financial discipline, thereby preventing many situations of embezzlement and waste from occurring.
    (3) Partial Document Inspection
    Partial document inspection is an inspection of a certain work of an enterprise due to work needs or receipt of certain feedback. Document inspection is not limited to inspecting documents, but also must conduct on-site and in-kind inspections. Only by being good at adopting these two aspects of comparison can the inspection work be done well. The types of work of partial document inspection are very broad. For various work of enterprises, such as personnel staffing, labor discipline, materials, fuel, product quality, production rhythm, cash management, potential assets, and the implementation of a certain important law or regulations and systems promulgated by the ministry and bureau, key points can be selected to conduct specialized and in-depth inspections, thereby uncovering problems and making suggestions for improving work.
    The Harbin Railway Audit Bureau conducted a total of 1,617 partial document inspections from January to September 1953, uncovering and correcting a large number of various off-book materials, black treasuries, and unplanned expenditures. Through this inspection, the supervisory personnel gradually accumulated inspection experience in various tasks, from not being able to do comprehensive document inspection to being able to do comprehensive document inspection. This inspection method is very suitable in the current situation where some supervisory work institutions have just been established, have insufficient strength, and lack experience.
    (4) Comprehensive Document Inspection
    Comprehensive document inspection is an inspection conducted periodically or irregularly to examine all business activities and various parts of the work of an enterprise. This is a more complicated inspection work. Through this inspection, it is possible to uncover and correct existing shortcomings in various tasks of enterprise units in order to further explore various shortcomings in the work system, and to make comprehensive suggestions for improving the work system and consolidating the economic accounting system.
    Specific inspection outlines are made for each inspection, and inspection teams are organized. When necessary, relevant technical personnel are also absorbed to form joint teams. For example, when inspecting a locomotive depot, locomotive engineers, thermal technicians, economic planners, and other relevant personnel are included in the team. At the beginning of the inspection, the inspection team first explains the purpose of the inspection to the person in charge of the inspected unit, asks them to provide information, and requests the Party committee to mobilize the Party and League organizations to cooperate and support the inspection work. At the same time, people are sent to conduct a sudden inspection of the unit's treasury to prevent the malpractice of cashiers privately using cash on hand to temporarily make up for deficiencies. In addition, the provisional advance fund is also checked to see whether the use of funds is appropriate, whether the previous advance has been reimbursed, whether there are any outstanding debts, whether the reimbursement receipts are complete, and whether there are any duplicate reimbursements. In order to avoid individual advance personnel from privately misappropriating public funds, on-site spot checks are also conducted in conjunction with the unit's chief accountant.
    Then, according to the inspection outline, inspections of various tasks are carried out separately. First, the inspection starts with reviewing and analyzing the final accounts statements, finding problems, and then tracing the problems in order of severity to thoroughly study the root causes of the problems. For example, if it is found during the analysis that a certain product has not completed the planned task or the consumption of materials exceeds the standard, the problem is carefully traced first, and its root cause is deeply explored. Through this review, it is necessary to determine the quality of its accounting statistics work, the level of personnel ability, and the source of funds and the status of its use.
    Secondly, various documents, receipt vouchers, transfer vouchers, and account books are examined in detail. In each inspection, various document, voucher, and account book comparison methods are often adopted to discover problems. This inspection can discover whether there is false reporting, embezzlement, and other fraudulent activities. In the past, this method has been used to expose many mistakes and shortcomings.
    Then, on-site and in-kind inspections are carried out. Because some enterprise units have very good accounting reports on paper, but they are inconsistent with the actual situation, in order to prove this situation, it is also necessary to check the materials and supplies in the warehouse and compare the actual data with the accounting statistics reports to determine its correctness.
    In the document inspection, it should be ascertained whether the formulation and issuance of the production and financial plan of the enterprise unit is timely and correct; the actual situation of the completion of various indicators and the enterprise's overall management situation and the results of its economic activities and financial situation should be ascertained; it should be checked whether it faithfully implements government policies and regulations and orders from higher levels, as well as the implementation of the supervisory authority's suggestions and the improvement of work; finally, realistic conclusions should be drawn on the basic advantages and disadvantages of the enterprise unit and their causes.
    Whether it is a comprehensive document inspection or a partial document inspection, the results of the inspection must be recorded truthfully after the inspection work is completed. This is the most important task in the document inspection work. If the record is not compiled well, it will greatly affect the effect of the inspection work. When making records, it is important to avoid exaggeration or understatement, and to avoid subjective assumptions. For the sake of prudence, the record must be signed by the person in charge of the inspected unit and the chief accountant after it is compiled. If they have different opinions, they can submit a written explanation after the record. The auditor cannot record the conclusions of the inspection or make suggestions in the record, but can only, based on the record and the other party's explanation, prepare a draft suggestion letter and send it to the leading authority of the inspected unit after it has been approved by the leader. These suggestion letters all require the leading authorities of the inspected units to put forward specific measures to improve the work within a certain period of time, and assign resident auditors or form special groups to supervise and inspect them. In this way, the inspected units can be urged to pay attention to and implement various suggested items. The supervisory authority does not directly handle problems on behalf of the administrative department in order to ensure the unity of enterprise command and avoid the phenomenon of unclear division of responsibilities.
    After each comprehensive document inspection, the person in charge of each inspected unit must convene a cadre meeting, at which the inspection personnel will make a summary report on the inspection results and seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism. Past experience has proven that this is a very effective method of improving work. If minor embezzlement and theft and other violations of discipline are found in the inspection, it is suggested that the leading authority of the unit give appropriate treatment; if the circumstances are serious and require criminal penalties, the relevant records and certificates are submitted to the judicial authority for handling.
    (5) Review of Annual and Quarterly Summaries
    Reviewing the annual and quarterly summaries (final accounts and balance sheets) of the completion of production and financial plans, analyzing the economic activities and financial situation of the entire enterprise, exposing shortcomings and errors in business, finding out the reasons, drawing conclusions, and putting forward opinions on correcting and making up for shortcomings in the next year or quarter are of great help to the implementation of future plans and the improvement of enterprise work. Enterprise units are generally accustomed to calculating numbers, and they are satisfied if the profit number is large. However, the Audit Bureau can determine whether the source of its profit is legitimate by reviewing the final accounts. For example, if a unit obtains a lot of profit, it is found that its main production indicators have not been completed, or it has reduced the quality of products in order to obtain more profit, and it has incorrectly saved employees' health care fees and technical safety fees, this should be criticized. Reviewing the final accounts is also conducting a final inspection of the entire process of implementing the production and financial plan.
    Reviewing the enterprise's production and financial plan, supervising the implementation of the production and financial plan, that is, conducting daily supervision and ex-post partial document inspection and comprehensive document inspection, and finally conducting a summary review of the production and financial final accounts, these are all closely related. This is a set of active, strict, and scientific supervision methods.
    4. Relying on the Broad Masses to Conduct Supervision
    In order to lay the mass foundation for supervisory work, the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau has also established the work of non-production auditors (supervision correspondents) and the work of handling people's letters. These two tasks are used to realize bottom-up supervision. At present, there are 1,095 non-production auditors in various units of the Harbin Railway, and they have uncovered 2,486 problems in 1953. Non-production auditors establish groups according to production units, and resident auditors lead their daily work. A group symposium is held once a month to exchange work experience. At the meeting, the resident auditor explains the central task of the supervisory work for the month, and asks everyone to pay attention to collecting relevant materials in advance. The Audit Bureau also provides material rewards to non-production auditors who are active in their work and have made significant achievements, after obtaining the consent of the Party and government leaders of the original unit.
    Regarding the work of handling people's letters, the working regulations of the Audit Bureau stipulate that the Audit Bureau and the line audit offices must unconditionally accept and investigate opinions put forward by employees of the Harbin Railway Administration system and locomotive and rolling stock repair factories, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factories, and individual citizens regarding improving railway work or issues related to the actions of railway personnel. The Harbin Railway Audit Bureau handled a total of 420 people's letters in 1953, and 89% have been closed. For example, the people's letters revealed the serious departmentalism of the dispatcher of the Changchun Branch Bureau and the stationmaster on duty in Tieling. After the Audit Bureau sent people to check and confirm, it suggested that the Administration Bureau give administrative punishment to the relevant personnel in error, which played a good role in overcoming departmentalism.
    Experience has proven that after supervisory work is combined with mass supervision, it expands the horizons of supervisory personnel and strengthens the power of supervision. There are many problems that are not easily detected by supervisory personnel, and non-production auditors and the people will reflect them.
    5. Strict Internal Work System
    The Harbin Railway Audit Bureau not only has a set of scientific and strict division of labor internally, but also has the following advantages in the internal work system:
    (1) Conducting Supervision in a Planned Way
    The Audit Bureau formulates specific plans for supervision and inspection work every quarter. This plan is the action program for audit personnel. The characteristic of the Audit Bureau's work plan is that it is clear and specific. It not only stipulates when and where to conduct which type of inspection, but also stipulates the executors and handling methods of each task. For example, who is responsible for the inspection of which places and which problems, who is responsible for the analysis of transportation business operations or the analysis of final accounts, and when and by whom the inspection results will be handled, there are very specific regulations. Therefore, the Audit Bureau and its subordinate units can think of how to do all the work in the second and third stages when starting the first stage of work in each quarter. Everyone also knows what to do when, so they can actively create conditions (including understanding the situation and familiarizing themselves with the business or asking teachers to teach, etc.) to strive to better complete the task. Therefore, work efficiency is high, and there is no phenomenon of "intermittence."
    Whether the Audit Bureau is planning a comprehensive document inspection or a partial document inspection, it generally takes unified action in conjunction with the central task. For example, in the first quarter, in order to lay the foundation for saving expenditures and reducing costs, it is planned to focus on checking the entire railway's funds, materials, fuel, staffing, and administrative expenses. In order to prevent many seasonal problems (such as flood prevention in summer and cold prevention in winter) from affecting the entire railway's transportation business operations, it is planned in advance to take a unified pace and vigorously conduct inspections.
    (2) Organizing Competitions and Exploring Potential
    With a specific work plan, it is necessary to organize forces, give full play to potential, and implement and implement this plan. The Audit Bureau adopts labor competition methods to encourage the enthusiasm and patriotism of supervisory personnel and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of planned tasks.
    The Audit Bureau stipulates the basic items and indicators of the competition, but it changes with the development of supervisory work. For example, if it is necessary to strengthen ex-ante audit work or to strengthen the work of organizing non-production auditors during this period, then the indicators on the "ex-ante audit initiative to discover problems" or on the "work of non-production auditors" will be appropriately increased, which will further arouse the attention of supervisory personnel in this regard, thereby ensuring the improvement of this work.
    The competition stipulates that whether each supervisory agency and supervisory personnel can complete the planned or temporary tasks in a timely manner is used as the standard for evaluation, and it is strictly stipulated that those who fail to complete the task, change the plan without the bureau's instructions, fail to submit the monthly summary report in a timely manner, and falsely report materials will be disqualified from the competition. The competition also particularly emphasizes the quality of supervisory work: it is not only necessary to complete the task according to the plan, but also to focus on reviewing "whether the work is in-depth," "whether major problems have been discovered," "what is the effect," and "how is the improvement," etc. As a result of the competition, spiritual or material rewards are given to organizations or individuals with significant achievements, and the chief auditor personally or sends representatives to hold a conference to award prizes, encourage and comfort, and point out the reasons for the victory and the shortcomings that should be overcome in the future. The methods of competition and reward can both encourage the enthusiasm of the staff and improve the discipline of the staff.
    (3) Summarizing Work in a Scientific Way
    The Audit Bureau conducts a summary when the work comes to an end. The method of summarizing work is to summarize work with statistical tables, and attach a brief explanation. The writing of the explanation requires simplicity, clarity, brevity, and pithiness. This method of table summary can not only express the work situation during the entire reporting period, but also be simple and timely, which not only saves the waste of time in the summary process, but also reduces many difficulties in the summary work. Through such a summary method, plus the timely synthesis of various work materials, these materials can be fully utilized to continuously study the development law of problems, which can be used to guide the work in the next quarter.
    The supervisory system diligently created by Soviet experts of the China Changchun Railway is a successful example of applying the advanced Soviet supervisory system and experience to China's railway enterprises. This system has played a significant role in protecting state property and is of great help to enterprise administrative leaders in implementing economic accounting systems and planned management. Although this is only a successful experience in supervisory work in China's railway enterprises, some of its basic principles and practices are also applicable to other enterprises in China. This system will be gradually promoted in China's enterprises, so that supervisory work can play its due role in realizing the country's general tasks, and the supervisory authority can become a powerful assistant to the Party in supervising enterprises and supervising the implementation of national policies and regulations under the leadership of the Party.

    哈尔滨铁路稽核局监察工作经验
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会办公厅
    哈尔滨铁路稽核（监察）局的工作，是在中长铁路监察工作的基础上建立起来的。中苏共管的中国长春铁路公司成立后，鉴于当时中国铁路的经营方法和管理制度相当混乱，干部的政治、思想和业务水平不高，亟需加强对企业的监督，就根据苏联国家监察制度的先进经验结合我国铁路的具体情况，一九五○年五月成立了监事会及其工作机构——稽核局的组织。自一九五○年五月至一九五二年底，稽核局仅通过事先事后的检查工作，就揭发了盗窃物资、伪报生产成绩、违反定员纪律、规章制度和无计划或超计划开支等事项所造成的损失、浪费和不应支付的款额共达六百二十四亿余元；未同意支付的单据款额达二百四十二亿余元；追回各种损失、欠款约计三百七十余亿元；在审查生产财务计划和定员草案时提出的各种建议，更给国家节约了大量的财力、人力、物力。如在两年多时间中，即建议裁减了浮多人员六千二百四十八名，节约了年度工资总额一百八十五亿余元。
    一九五三年起，中长铁路移交我国后，中央人民政府铁道部为了巩固和推广这一先进经验，即在原中长铁路公司监事会与稽核局的组织和业务基础上，建立了哈尔滨铁路稽核局。它受铁道部直接领导，对哈尔滨铁路管理局系统和哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂、大连机车车辆制造工厂（现归中央第一机械工业部管辖）进行全面的监督。哈尔滨铁路稽核局在一九五三年内在事先和事后的监督中，防止了不合理开支达一百五十二亿九千余万元；揭发账外材料、黑金库、黑仓库、无计划或超计划修建开支、浪费、伪报、贪污、盗窃等事件，款额达六百二十二亿余元；揭发各种损失、欠款计五十二亿余元，其中经过努力已追缴回四十二亿余元；根据检查资料建议裁减的浮多人员计四千零九十七人，节约年度工资二十二亿九千余万元。中长铁路和哈尔滨铁路两个时期的监察工作，不仅揭发了以上的许多问题，防止和避免了国家资财的许多损失。同时，还教育和提高了干部经营管理社会主义企业的水平，帮助改善了企业的管理工作。目前，哈尔滨铁路各单位广大职工已普遍树立了严格遵守财务制度和贯彻计划管理与经济核算的观念，并增强了爱护国家财产的责任心。这就给该路局完成并超额完成生产财务计划、减少超支浪费、为国家积累资金提供了重要保证。
    该局之所以能够取得上述成绩，是与下述重要经验分不开的：
    一、任务明确具体
    哈尔滨铁路稽核局有一个成熟的工作条例，作为自己监察业务活动的法律根据。这个条例是按照原中长铁路稽核局工作条例拟制的；而中长铁路稽核局的工作条例又是根据苏联监察工作先进经验结合我国铁路实际情况而制订的。在这个条例中除了规定稽核局的基本任务是对哈尔滨铁路各单位及两工厂的国家资财的收入、支出、保管、统计以及管理工作进行事先和事后的监督外，还详细地规定了稽核局应负的职责。这样既能使其在工作上有所遵循，便于进行工作，同时也明确了监察机关只能对监督检查中所揭露的问题提出改进工作的建议，决不代替行政解决或处理任何问题，因而也就划分了监察机关与被监察机关的职责范围，保证了企业指挥的统一。为了保证完成监察机关所负的职责，条例中还规定了监察工作权限：总稽核有权对被监察单位进行计划的或突然的检查；在进行监督检查工作时，各级行政人员须提出有关的统计资料、各种文件和书面说明；各单位的开支不经稽核人员的同意，则暂时不能支付，而需报请上级解决，经过上级机关与监察机关商讨批准后，方得支付；总稽核的意见为解决一切争执问题的最后决定……等。这就有力地保证了监察工作的顺利进行。
    二、组织系统的保证
    哈尔滨铁路稽核局是由铁道部直接领导，以独立、垂直的组织系统，在各铁路分局设立沿线稽核室，在各基层单位派出驻在稽核员，对哈尔滨铁路管理局系统及两工厂进行监督。监察机关把自己的干部直接派到各企业部门执行监察任务，这就使监察人员不受被监察机关的拘束，脱离本位主义和地方主义的影响，解除各种顾虑，坚持国家利益，向一切违背国家利益的不良现象进行斗争。因为往往有些机关和工作人员存在着本位主义和地方主义的思想；有些企业的领导同志对下级人员的缺点和错误抱着迁就的态度；有些同志则自己存在着官僚主义作风，对自己工作上的缺点和错误不但不进行自我批评，反而替错误辩护；另外，的确也有不少单位和工作人员的错误，是和领导上的错误分不开的。为此，只有监察人员不受被监察机关拘束，才能更好地、有效地发挥监察工作的作用和力量。
    中长铁路和哈尔滨铁路三年多来的监察工作经验，已经充分证明了独立、垂直的组织机构的优点。例如：一九五二年十月，昂昂溪工务段段长未经上级批准和取得驻在稽核员的同意，私自与某工厂签订了承做该厂暖气管工程协议一件，用线路维修计划中的人工制造；收到的工程费也未交会计收账，存于工会，企图隐瞒上级，作为单位的小家底，严重地违反了国家的财政制度。昂昂溪地区驻在稽核员曾先后用口头和书面向该段长建议改正错误，但该段长不仅未接受建议，反动用这笔款购买了收音机。由于监察人员的坚持原则，最后终于纠正了这种违反国家财政制度的行为。如果监察人员是这个单位的干部，受这个单位领导，那他们对这个单位的负责人就不容易进行这种坚持原则的斗争。
    同时独立、垂直的组织机构，精干灵活，领导集中，上下联系密切，掌握情况全面及时，便于指挥。因此哈尔滨铁路稽核局目前虽只有工作人员一百五十四人，但却可以对拥有十多万员工的哈尔滨铁路管理局系统和两个机车车辆工厂发挥很大的监督作用。
    三、一套科学的监督方法
    稽核局是通过对生产财务计划的制定、执行和总结进行经常的、有计划的监督检查，来实现其对国家资财的收入、支出、保管、统计，以及企业管理工作的监督任务的，目的在于及时发现或预防问题的发生。它的主要工作方法如下：
    （一）审查生产财务计划
    根据中长铁路公司章程的规定，管理局年度生产财务计划草案在未送上级审核批准之前，应送交监事会审查，并由监事会提出建议。监事会在审查年度计划草案中，要掌握全国经济建设发展的情况和铁路沿线的经济状况，根据国家对铁路的要求（上级控制数字）和上年度计划与实际完成的数字，以及铁路现行技术设备、将来可能增加的技术能力、铁路内部可能挖掘的潜力（职工的发明创造、合理化建议、劳动竞赛等）……，对计划中各种生产指标、收入、开支和利润积累，逐一地进行详细的分析研究，指出计划中的缺点，并提出合理可行的建议。如果发现计划草案中各种生产指标不符合整个国民经济计划的要求；发现生产总值、劳动计划与工资计划不是根据充分利用铁路内部资源和生产设备能力规定的；或者发现没有考虑合理化建议对于技术作业影响的程度，以致影响合理地提高劳动生产率；以及发现计划的编制只是单纯地从哪一天、哪一个月、哪一个季度的条件出发，按算术平均数计划，而未以先进的平均定额作为计划的根据等，监事会就要立即指出，并提出合理的建议。如果发现计划重复和误列，说明书与计划表数字不符，计划遗漏，以及过多地把支出编列在其他项目内而不加以说明等，监事会也要予以指出，提出实际可行的建议。经过这样对年度生产财务计划草案的认真审查，不仅提高了工作水平，节约了开支，增加了利润，而且对改进铁路的计划工作起到很大的推动作用。
    （二）日常监督
    哈尔滨铁路管理局系统现有大小经济核算、会计决算和报销等业务单位一千三百八十个，稽核局在其中三百四十个较大的单位派有驻在稽核员进行日常监督工作。日常监督就是由驻在稽核员根据国家政策法令与生产财务计划，对企业单位的各种现金收支、物品销售和订购、合同和契约的签订等生产财务交易行为的一切文件单据，实行事先审查。审查这些交易行为是否符合计划，是否合于需要、可能与节约的原则；审查有关支用钱款的计划是由谁颁布的，各项拨款是否为生产和工作所需要。这些交易行为不取得驻在稽核员的同意是不能办理的。日常监督并不只局限于单据的审查，还要善于主动地依靠党组织，组织与领导不脱产稽核员（人民监察通讯员），并深入到车间去检查生产进度和技术指标，从生产过程中了解各项开支是否合理和必要。如果发现某项工作有缺点，就向该单位负责人提出改进的意见；如果发现某项会计科目已接近计划定额时，就提起单位首长与总会计注意，并协助其研究防止超支的办法。
    在企业中实行日常监督的结果，使各企业单位都树立了新的风气，首先使企业单位的负责人认识了自己对国家财产应负的责任，绝不能以自己主观的愿望，随意开支，使国家财产遭到不应有的损失。特别是在计划管理与各种制度不健全的单位，更加促进并帮助了负责人及会计人员坚持各种制度并改进经营管理的状况，加强了他们的国家整体观念和财政纪律观念，从而防止了许多贪污浪费等情事的发生。
    （三）部分文件检查
    部分文件检查是由于工作的需要或得到某些反映而对企业的某项工作所进行的检查。文件检查并不是局限于检查文件，而且还必须进行实地实物的检查。只有善于采取这两方面对照的方式进行，才能做好检查工作。部分文件检查的工作种类很广泛，对企业的各项工作，如人事定员、劳动纪律、材料、燃料、产品质量、生产节奏、现金管理、潜在资财，以及某一重要法令或部、局颁布之章则制度执行情况等，均可选择重点，进行专门的、深入的检查，从而揭发问题，并提出改善工作的建议。
    哈尔滨铁路稽核局在一九五三年一月至九月间共进行了一千六百十七次部分文件检查，揭发和纠正了大量的各种账外材料、黑金库、无计划开支等。监察人员通过这种检查，也逐渐积累了各项工作的检查经验，由不会作全面文件检查进到能作全面文件检查。这种检查方式在目前一些监察工作机构刚建立、力量不足、缺乏经验的情况下，是很适用的。
    （四）全面文件检查
    全面文件检查是为了定期或不定期考查企业的一切业务活动和各个部分工作而进行的检查。这是一种较复杂的检查工作。通过这种检查，能揭发和纠正企业单位各项工作上现存的缺点以进一步发掘各种工作制度上的缺陷，并提出全面的改进工作制度和巩固经济核算制的建议。
    在每次检查时都作具体的检查提纲，并组织检查小组，必要时还吸收有关的技术人员组织联合组。如检查机务段时，在组内编入机务工程师、热力技术员、经济计划员及其他有关人员参加检查。在检查开始时，先由检查组向被检查单位负责人说明来意，要求其提供资料，并请求党委发动党团组织配合与支持检查工作。与此同时，即派人对该单位的金库实行突然的检查，以防止出纳人员私自动用库存现金而临时弥补的弊端。另外还检查暂付预支金，检查其领款用途是否妥当，上次预支是否已报销，是否还有欠款，报销单据是否完整及有无重复报销等。为避免个别预支人员私自挪用公款，还会同该单位总会计进行实地抽查。
    接着就根据检查提纲分别进行各项工作的检查。首先是由审查分析决算报表入手，发现问题，然后按照问题的严重程度，顺序地把问题追透，研究问题发生的根源。如分析时发现某产品完不成计划任务或消耗材料超过标准较严重，就先仔细追查这个问题，深入地发掘其根源。通过这一审查，要判明其会计统计工作的好坏，人员能力的高低和资金来源及其使用的状况等。
    其次是详细审查各种单据、收支传票、转账传票和账簿等。在每次检查中多采取各种单据、传票和账簿对照的审查方法来发掘问题。这种检查可以发现是否有伪报、贪污舞弊等情事。过去用这种方法曾揭露不少的错误与缺点。
    再即进行实地实物的检查。因为有的企业单位账面报表作得很好，但和实际情况不一致，为了证明这种情况，还要清查仓库的材料物资等，用实际的资料来与会计统计报表对照，以判明其正确性。
    在文件检查中应当查明企业单位的生产财务计划编制和下达、执行的是否及时和正确；查明各项指标完成的实际情况和企业的整个经营管理情况及其经济活动的结果与财政状况；检查其对政府政策法令和上级命令是否忠实执行，以及对监察机关的建议的执行情况和改进工作的情况；最后还要对该企业单位的基本优缺点及其原因得出切合实际的结论。
    无论是全面文件检查或部分文件检查，在检查工作完毕后，都要实事求是地把检查结果作成记录。这是文件检查工作中最重要的一件工作。如果记录编制的不好，就会大大地影响检查工作的效果。作记录时要注意既不夸大也不缩小，并切忌主观臆断。为了慎重起见，记录编制后须由被检查单位负责人和总会计签字，他们有不同意见可在记录之后提出书面说明。稽核员不能在记录中记入检查的结论或提出建议事项，只能根据记录和对方的说明，拟具建议信草案，并经领导者批准后，向被检查单位领导机关发出。这些建议信都要求各被检查单位的领导机关在一定时期内提出相应的改进工作的具体措施，并责成驻在稽核员或组成专门小组予以监督检查。这样就可以督促被检查单位重视与执行各项建议事项。监察机关不代替行政部门直接处理问题，以保证企业指挥的统一，避免职责范围划分不清的现象。
    在每次全面文件检查后，各被检查单位的负责人要召开干部会议，会上由检查人员就检查结果作总结性的报告，严肃地展开批评与自我批评。过去经验证明这是一种很有效的改进工作的方法。在检查中如果发现有轻微的贪污和盗窃等行为及其他违反纪律的情事，则建议该单位领导机关予以适当处理；对情节严重须受刑事处分者，则将有关记录及证件提送司法机关处理。
    （五）审查年度、季度总结
    审查生产财务计划完成情况的年度、季度总结（决算及资产负债表），分析整个企业的经济活动与财政状况，揭露业务中的缺点、错误，找出原因，作出结论，提出下一年度或季度的改正和弥补缺点的意见，这对以后计划的执行与改进企业的工作有很大帮助。企业单位一般是习惯算数字，利润数字大就满意。但稽核局通过审查决算，就可以判明其利润来源是否正当。如某单位取得利润很多，结果查明其主要生产指标未完成，或为了多得利润而降低了产品质量，以及不正确地节约职工的保健费、技术安全费等，这就要提出批评。审查决算也就是对生产财务计划执行的整个过程进行一次最后的检查。
    审查企业的生产财务计划，监督生产财务计划的执行，即进行日常监督与事后的部分文件检查和全面文件检查，最后对生产财务决算进行总结性的审查，这些都是密切联系着的。这是一套积极的、严密的、科学的监督方法。
    四、依靠广大群众进行监督
    为打下监察工作的群众基础，哈尔滨铁路稽核局还建立了不脱产稽核员（监察通讯员）工作和处理人民来信工作。通过这两项工作来实现自下而上的监督。现在哈尔滨铁路各单位不脱产稽核员有一千零九十五人，他们在一九五三年中揭发的问题已有二千四百八十六件。不脱产稽核员按生产单位建立小组，由驻在稽核员领导其日常工作，每月都要召开一次小组座谈会，交流工作经验。在会上由驻在稽核员说明本月份监察工作的中心任务，要求大家事先注意搜集有关材料。稽核局对工作积极有显著成绩的不脱产稽核员，经征得原单位党政领导上的同意，还进行物质的奖励。
    关于处理人民来信工作，稽核局的工作条例中规定：哈尔滨铁路管理局系统及机车车辆修理工厂、机车车辆制造工厂员工以及个别公民提出有关改善铁路工作或有关铁路人员行动问题的意见，稽核局及沿线稽核室所有工作人员必须无条件地接受并进行调查。哈尔滨铁路稽核局在一九五三年中共处理了人民来信四百二十件，已有百分之八十九结案。如人民来信揭发了长春分局调度员和铁岭值班站长严重的本位主义，经稽核局派人检查证实后，即建议管理局给有关过失人员以行政处分，对克服本位主义起了良好作用。
    经验证明：监察工作和群众的监督结合以后，就扩大了监察人员的眼界，加强了监督的力量。有许多问题不容易被监察人员查觉的，不脱产稽核员和人民群众都会反映出来。
    五、严密的内部工作制度
    哈尔滨铁路稽核局内部不仅有一套科学的严密分工，而且内部工作制度上还具有下列优点：
    （一）有计划地进行监督
    稽核局每季度都制订监督检查工作的具体计划。这项计划就是稽核人员的行动纲领。稽核局的工作计划的特点是明确、具体。它不仅规定了什么时候对哪个地方进行哪一种检查，而且规定了各项工作的执行人和处理办法。如哪些人负责哪些地方和哪些问题的检查，由谁负责运输营业作业分析或决算分析，检查结果由哪些人在什么时候处理完毕，都有很具体的规定。因此稽核局及其所属各单位在每个季度内开始第一阶段工作时，即能联想到第二、第三阶段的全部工作如何做法。每个人也都心中有数，知道他什么时候干什么事，因而就能够积极创造条件（包括了解情况与熟悉业务或请老师讲授等）来争取更好地完成任务。因此工作效率高，没有什么“间歇”的现象。
    稽核局无论在计划全面文件检查或部分文件检查时，一般都是结合中心任务采取统一行动。如在第一季度为了打下节约开支、降低成本的基础，就计划抓住全路的资金、材料、燃料、定员与行政费用等几个重点进行检查。为了防止许多季节性的问题（如夏季防汛、冬季防寒等准备工作）影响全路运输营业工作，就事先计划采取统一的步调，大力进行检查。
    （二）组织竞赛、挖掘潜力
    有了具体的工作计划，就要组织力量，发挥潜力，执行与贯彻这一计划。稽核局是采取劳动竞赛方式来鼓舞监察人员的积极性与爱国主义热情，保证完成与超额完成计划任务的。
    稽核局规定有竞赛的基本项目和指标，但它是随着监察工作的发展而改变着的。如这个时期要加强事先稽核工作或要加强组织不脱产稽核员的工作，那就在“事先稽核主动发现问题”或在“不脱产稽核员的工作”这个项目上适当地提高它的指标，这样就更加引起监察人员在这方面的重视，从而保证了这个工作的提高。
    在竞赛中规定以每一监察机构和监察人员能不能及时完成计划或临时任务作为评奖的标准，而且严格规定：对完不成任务、没有局的指示而擅自变更计划、未能及时提出月末总结报告和伪报材料者，都要取消竞赛资格。竞赛中还特别强调监察工作的质量：不仅要按照计划完成任务，而且着重审查“工作是否深入”、“是否发现重大问题”、“效果如何”以及“改进情况如何”等。竞赛结果，对于有显著成绩的组织或个人要给以精神或物质奖励，并由总稽核亲自或派代表召开大会授奖，鼓励慰勉，指出优胜的原因与今后应克服的缺点。竞赛和奖励的办法，既能鼓舞工作人员的积极性，又能提高工作人员的纪律性。
    （三）以科学的方式来总结工作
    稽核局在工作告一段落时，都要进行总结。总结工作的方法，是以统计表格总结工作，并附以简要的说明，说明书的写法要求简单明了、短小精悍。这种表格总结方式，既能表达整个报告期间的工作情况，又能简便及时，不仅节省了总结过程中时间上的浪费，而且还减少了总结工作中许多困难。通过这样一个总结方法，再加上各种工作资料的及时综合，就能充分地利用这些资料，不断地来研究问题的发展规律，用以指导下一季度的工作。
    中长铁路苏联专家所辛勤努力创立的监察制度，是把苏联先进的监察制度和经验运用于我国铁路企业的成功范例。这个制度对保护国家财产起到了很大的作用，并对企业行政领导贯彻经济核算制和计划管理有很大帮助。虽然这只是在我国铁路企业实行成功的监察工作经验，但是它的一些基本原则和做法对我国其他的企业也是适用的。这一制度将在我国企业中逐步地推广起来，使监察工作在实现国家总任务中起到应有的作用，使监察机关在党的领导下成为党监督企业、监督国家政策法令执行的有力助手。
