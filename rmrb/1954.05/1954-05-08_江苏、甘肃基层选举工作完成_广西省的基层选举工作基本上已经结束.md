    Basic-level Election Work Completed in Jiangsu and Gansu
    Basic-level Election Work in Guangxi Province Basically Concluded
    Xinhua News Agency Report: Basic-level election work in Jiangsu Province has been fully completed. A people's congress system-based basic-level government has been universally established throughout the province. Over 90% of the voters in the province's twelve cities participated in the election. According to statistics from 88 townships in 38 counties of the first batch of areas undergoing general elections in rural areas, voters participating in the election accounted for 87.9% of the total number of voters.
    On the basis of extensive promotion of democracy, voters chose the people they deemed most satisfactory to be their representatives. According to statistics from five provincial cities including Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Xuzhou, among the 6,307 people's representatives elected, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members accounted for 36.7%, and workers accounted for over 34.8%. Outstanding figures such as Deng Guiyong, a national industrial labor model, Li Xiaying, leader of a national textile industrial model group, Wang Daqiao, a national agricultural labor model and special-class meritorious hero in diverting the Yi and regulating the Shu, and Grandma Lu, a national model of Class A patriotic health, have all gained the trust of local voters and been elected as people's representatives. In the general election, many basic-level cadres were also elected as people's representatives.
    After the general election, the basic-level people's congresses and people's government committees actively led the broad masses of people in production. After the general election, the township people's government committees in Jinshan County conscientiously implemented the resolutions of the people's congresses and strengthened their leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement, so that more than 2,000 mutual aid teams were consolidated and developed.
    Xinhua News Agency Report: The election work in more than 5,100 basic-level units in Gansu Province was completed at the end of April. The first basic-level people's congresses have been convened in various places, and basic-level people's governments have been elected. At the basic-level people's congresses, resolutions on developing production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and strengthening national unity were discussed and adopted.
    In the general election, people of all ethnic groups showed a high degree of political enthusiasm and carefully selected the people they were most satisfied with as their representatives. According to statistics from 625 basic-level units in 14 counties and cities, the average participation rate of voters reached 81.8%. The people in some old liberated areas paid particular attention to their right to vote. Although the population in Huachi County is scattered and transportation is inconvenient, the voter participation rate in many townships still reached over 90%. The representatives elected in various places are all outstanding figures who are called "leaders of socialism" by the broad masses of people, and some are representatives of various ethnic groups who have ties with the people. Among the 526 representatives elected in Lanzhou City, there are 154 outstanding Communist Party members and 197 outstanding workers. In areas with mixed ethnic populations, representatives were elected roughly in proportion to the population of each ethnic group, and ethnic groups with small populations were also appropriately taken care of. In nine townships in the Linxia Special District, the Hui population accounts for 25%, and the elected representatives account for 27%; the Dongxiang population accounts for 20%, and the elected representatives account for 27%; in the election, the Salar people, who are very small in number, also elected a representative.
    Xinhua News Agency Report: The basic-level election work in Guangxi Province, which lasted ten months, has now basically ended. There are a total of 10,000 basic-level units such as townships (towns) and urban districts in the province that have conducted elections. Now, most areas have convened basic-level people's congresses, and new basic-level governments have been established. According to statistics from 750 townships in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the participation rate of voters is generally above 80%. The voters participating in the elections throughout the province include Han, Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Dong, and Hui ethnic groups; whether they live in cities or villages, in remote mountains or on the borders of the motherland, and whatever their occupation, they have exercised their solemn right to vote and elected the people they consider the most satisfactory. The people's representatives elected in Huayuan Township, Xing'an County, received an average of over 85% of the votes of those who participated in the election. The election results in various places show that the political status of women has significantly improved. Women generally account for over 20% of the people's representatives. Many women have been elected as members of the township people's government committee or as township heads and deputy township heads.
    Guangxi Province is a multi-ethnic region, with ethnic minorities accounting for more than one-third of the province's total population. In this election, the spirit of national equality was universally promoted. In all townships where ethnic minorities reside, the Communist Party's ethnic policies were widely publicized during the election; when deliberating and electing representatives, the number of ethnic minority representatives was also appropriately taken into consideration.

    江苏、甘肃基层选举工作完成
    广西省的基层选举工作基本上已经结束
    江苏省基层选举工作已全部完成。全省普遍建立了人民代表大会制的基层政权。全省十二个城市的选民百分之九十以上参加了选举。据农村第一批普选地区三十八个县八十八个乡的统计，参加选举的选民占选民总数百分之八十七点九。
    在广泛发扬民主的基础上，选民选择了自己认为最满意的人当自己的代表。据南京、无锡、苏州、常州、徐州等五个省属市的统计，当选的六千三百零七个人民代表中，共产党员和青年团员占百分之三十六点七，工人占百分之三十四点八强。全国工业劳动模范邓桂永、全国纺织工业模范小组组长李霞影、全国农业劳动模范、导沂整沭特等功臣王大锹、全国甲等爱国卫生模范鲁大妈等优秀人物都得到当地选民的信任，当选为人民代表。在普选中，许多基层干部也当选为人民代表。
    普选结束后，基层人民代表大会和人民政府委员会积极领导广大人民进行生产。金山县各乡在普选后，乡人民政府委员会认真贯彻了人民代表大会的决议，加强对互助合作运动的领导，使两千多个互助组得到巩固和发展。　（据新华社讯）
    甘肃省五千一百多个基层单位的选举工作已经在四月底结束，各地普遍召开了第一次基层人民代表大会，选举了基层人民政府。在基层人民代表大会上，都讨论和通过了发展生产和互助合作运动以及加强民族团结等决议。
    在普选中各族人民表现了高度的政治热情，慎重挑选他们最满意的人当代表。据十四个县、市六百二十五个基层单位统计，参加选举的选民平均达到百分之八十一点八。一些老解放区的人民对自己的选举权利尤其重视。华池县虽然人口分散，交通不便，许多乡参加选举的选民仍然达到百分之九十以上。各地选举出来的代表，都是被广大人民称为“社会主义引路人”的优秀人物，有些是各民族中和人民有联系的代表人物。兰州市选出的五百二十六名代表中，有优秀的共产党员一百五十四人，优秀工人一百九十七人。在民族杂居地区，都大体上按照各民族人口比例选出了代表，并适当照顾到人口少的民族。临夏专区九个乡中，回族人口占百分之二十五，选出的代表占百分之二十七；东乡族人口占百分之二十，选出的代表占百分之二十七；在选举中，人数很少的撒拉族也选出了一名代表。

    历时十个月的广西省基层选举工作现已基本结束。全省进行选举的乡（镇）和市辖区等基层单位共有一万个，现在绝大部分地区已召开了基层人民代表大会，产生了新的基层政权。据桂西僮族自治区七百五十个乡的统计，参加选举的选民，一般都在百分之八十以上。全省参加选举的选民，包括汉、僮、苗、瑶、侗、回等民族；他们无论住在城市或乡村，住在深山僻野或祖国的边疆，无论从事何种职业，都行使了庄严的选举权利，选出了自己认为最满意的人。兴安县花源乡选出的人民代表所得的选票，平均占参加选举人数的百分之八十五以上。各地选举结果表明了妇女政治地位有显著的提高。妇女当选为人民代表的一般占人民代表的百分之二十以上。许多妇女当选为乡人民政府委员会委员或正、副乡长。
    广西省是一个多民族的地区，少数民族占全省总人口的三分之一以上。这次选举中，普遍发扬了民族平等的精神。凡有少数民族人民居住的乡，在选举中都广泛宣传了共产党的民族政策；酝酿和选举代表时，又适当照顾到少数民族代表的名额。
