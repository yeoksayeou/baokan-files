Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations Lead Impoverished Households Forward

　　The Door of the Closed Group Opens
　　Gulong Township is a key production township for the CCP Changtai County Committee in Fujian Province. About 90 percent of the farmers in the township are organized, and their production work is very good. However, the remaining 10 percent of individual farmers are mostly impoverished households. Besides jointly benefiting from water conservancy projects, their other production conditions are very poor. After the township Party branch and the county committee work team learned about this situation, they used various meetings to promote the significance of uniting impoverished households and specifically helped mutual aid and cooperative organizations unite individual farmers to improve production. Dai Laobian, a township cadre, led a mutual aid group. After several years of mutual aid, the nine group members had begun to prosper and were unwilling to accept new members. The masses said, "Laobian's group is a closed group." The comrades of the work team educated Dai Laobian. After Dai Laobian returned, he held a full group meeting, explaining that only by helping impoverished households solve their production difficulties could everyone achieve prosperity. After the group members understood these principles, they were willing to admit individual farmers into the group. They successively admitted three impoverished households. From then on, the masses said, "The door of Laobian's mutual aid group has opened." Under the influence of Dai Laobian's mutual aid group, other mutual aid groups also admitted impoverished households. Up to now, twenty individual farmers in the township with difficulties have joined mutual aid groups, and more than ten others have signed "mutual aid contracts" with mutual aid groups, solving problems such as lack of labor, draught animals, and farm tools. They are generally able to smoothly plow and transplant rice.

　　Contracting Work and Output, Neither Suffers Losses
　　Wang Tianze Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongzhang Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, formulated two methods to help impoverished households without labor to improve production. One is to adopt a system of contracting work and output for particularly difficult households. For example, Wang Zhaodi, an old woman in her sixties, has 2.3 mu of land that she cannot cultivate. The cooperative allows her to provide the 40 dan of fertilizer and seeds per mu that she used to apply, and the cooperative is responsible for everything else. According to preliminary calculations, in the past, when she cultivated the land herself, each mu yielded only two shi of coarse grains. This year, after the cooperative's processing, fertilization, intensive cultivation, and meticulous work, each mu can yield 3.3 shi. After the autumn harvest, she receives 2.1 shi per mu, and the remaining increased output is used to cover the cooperative's processing and fertilization costs. This ensures that neither the cooperative members nor the impoverished households suffer losses, and both benefit. In addition, she is allowed to do some light work in the cooperative to earn some work-day dividends. Another method is to provide appropriate labor assistance to other impoverished households based on the number of workdays their land requires each year, ensuring that their production is no lower than the general level.

　　Carry Out Mass Credit Work
　　There are 106 households in Jiefang Village, Huachuan County, Songjiang Province. Among them, there are 17 impoverished households, most of whom are short of both food and money, and their production and lives are very difficult. Gao Wenxue, the secretary of the village Party branch, proposed to carry out mass credit work to help them solve their difficulties at the branch meeting. After the meeting, Party members took the lead in making deposits, and a total of 6.35 million yuan was deposited within two days. According to the loan principles, after review and approval procedures, loans were issued to impoverished households, and more than 1 million yuan was deposited in the district credit department.
　　After using the loan to buy enough food, Wu Shiyong, an impoverished household, immediately went everywhere to find sources of manure. He planned to increase the fertilized area by two shang. Yang Tinggui, an impoverished household, said after solving the problem of food, "This is all thanks to the branch. I asked around for more than ten days, willing to pay 30% interest, but no one would lend me money." With the difficulties of the impoverished households solved, Liang Yuchun, who originally intended to lend money at high interest rates, had to deposit his remaining 1.4 million yuan in the credit cooperative.

　　The Increased Production Plan is Guaranteed
　　There are 75 impoverished households in Qingyuan Township, Li County, Hunan Province. They have many production difficulties. This year, the township Party branch used the power of mutual aid and cooperation to conscientiously help impoverished households, adopting different methods according to different situations, solving specific difficulties, so that the township's plan to increase grain production by more than 200,000 jin this year is guaranteed. Xiong Keyou's family of six has only one laborer, but he is also ill and cannot do heavy work. He has to hire labor for heavy work, and this expense alone cost him 9.5 shi of grain last year. This year, after the Liu Wenfeng mutual aid group accepted him, they assigned him to do light work such as cutting field edges, cutting grass, and grazing cattle. In this way, he can reduce his expenses by 9.5 shi of grain this year compared to last year. The township Party branch solved the difficulties of 43 households through this method. In addition, they used methods such as mutual aid groups contracting cultivation, substitute cultivation, and tenant cultivation to solve the difficulties of 23 households, and the difficulties of the other nine households were solved by relying on relatives and neighbors.

　　Help Impoverished Households Participate in Mutual Aid Organizations
　　The CCP Shuangyang County Committee in Jilin Province pays attention to helping impoverished households participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The county committee held an enlarged meeting of the county committee members to specifically study how to support impoverished households to participate in production and mutual aid cooperation, and designated a county committee member to be responsible for this work. Due to the importance attached by the county committee, many district and village cadres also attached importance to this work. All 18 impoverished households in Fanjia Village in the Sixth District have joined mutual aid groups. Of the 200 impoverished households in the First District, 170 have now joined mutual aid groups. The impoverished households who have been accepted into the groups generally have high production enthusiasm. Zhao Deshan, an impoverished household in the Sixth District, was welcomed by the whole group because he was active in production after joining the Zhang Guoxin mutual aid group.

　　Lay the Foundation for Overall Increased Production
　　Yanjia Village Township in the Second District of Yishui County, Shandong Province, has seven villages with 18 households without labor, accounting for 3.3 percent of the total households in the township. At the beginning of spring plowing and production, some rural cadres were satisfied with leading the spring plowing and production of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and did not pay attention to individual farmers without labor. According to this situation, the CCP Yanjia Village Township General Branch educated the masses and, based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit for farmers, adopted different methods according to different situations to solve the spring plowing and sowing difficulties of all labor-free households in the township. Impoverished households with better living conditions adopted the method of finding grass and materials, and were cultivated by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Impoverished households with livestock but no labor solved their labor shortage by exchanging labor for cattle labor. Impoverished households with female labor, such as Wang Shi in Yaojiaguan Village, who had 3.6 mu of spring fields, were helped by the village's Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperative to cultivate the land. The labor and livestock used were converted into work points, and she was asked to repay the work when the cooperative had work she could do. Those who were particularly poor and truly had no labor were helped to solve the problem by adopting the method of uncompensated cultivation. For example, Li Danniang in Yaojiaguan Village, who was 84 years old, had 0.7 mu of spring fields and was very poor. She was voluntarily and uncompensatedly helped to cultivate the land by the Wang Xuji mutual aid group. By solving the spring plowing and sowing difficulties of all labor-free people in the township, a good foundation was laid for overall increased production.

　　Help Impoverished Households with Timely Spring Plowing
　　There are eight impoverished households in Shantou Village in the Ninth District of Ningcheng County, Rehe Province, who are not only short of food but also lack labor. These eight households have a total of 61 mu of land, of which 28 mu are still short of manure. For example, Xue Widow's 16 mu of land has 10 mu without manure. Li Jiang is chronically ill and cannot work. The manure is still in the pen and has not been taken out, and four mu of land has not been turned over. The village Party branch discovered these problems during the inspection of spring plowing preparation and immediately convened a branch meeting to study solutions. After discussion, everyone clarified that the fundamental solution was to absorb them into mutual aid groups, but at present, they must find all means to help them do a good job in spring plowing production. Therefore, Hou Guoxi took the initiative to use his plow to turn Li Jiang's land over once and send the manure to the field. Xing Gui planted the land for Xing Lin. Bai Yongjie lent Bai Jingyun his plow and volunteered to repay the labor cost after the autumn. In this way, these eight impoverished households solved their current spring plowing difficulties.

　　Old Man Liu's Crops Are Planted
　　After planting their crops, the Zhang Bingwen mutual aid group in Buhao Township, Fifth District, Jinji County, Ningxia Province, discovered that the individual farmer Liu Liangui was still unable to work in the field because he lacked this and that. The group held a meeting to discuss helping Old Liu with production. Everyone said: Our mutual aid group must unite individual farmers well, so we must help them solve their production difficulties and guide them towards the road of getting organized. After the meeting, the group members quickly sent the manure to Old Liu's three mu of land and helped him plant the crops. Old Liu said with emotion: If it weren't for the mutual aid group to help, not to mention being able to plant, even if other people's crops grew out, I wouldn't be able to get my manure to the field.

    互助合作组织带动困难户前进
    关门组的大门打开啦
    古农乡是中共福建省长泰县委的生产重点乡，全乡组织起来的农民占农业总户数百分之九十左右，这些农民生产工作都做得很好。但其余百分之十的单干农民，多半是困难户，除了兴修水利共同受益外，其他的生产条件都很差。该乡党支部和县委工作组了解了这个情况后，便利用各种会议，宣传团结困难户的意义，并具体帮助互助合作组织团结单干农民搞好生产。乡干部戴老扁领导的互助组，经过几年互助，九户组员都开始富裕了，不愿吸收新组员，群众都说：“老扁组是个关门组。”工作组同志对戴老扁进行了教育，戴老扁回去后就开全组大会，说明必须帮助困难户解决生产上的困难，才能达到大家富裕。组员知道了这些道理，也都愿意吸收单干农民入组了，他们先后吸收了三户困难户。从此以后，群众都说：“老扁互助组的大门打开啦。”在戴老扁互助组影响下，别的互助组也吸收困难户入组。到目前为止，全乡已有二十户有困难的单干农民参加了互助组，还有十多户和互助组订了“互助合同”，解决了缺乏劳力、耕牛、农具等问题，普遍能够顺利地溶田、插秧了。
    包工包产，互不吃亏
    山西省平顺县东彰乡王天则农业生产合作社，为了帮助无劳力的困难户搞好生产，订出了两个办法。一个是对特殊困难户，采取包工包产制。如六十多岁的老大娘王召弟，家有二亩三分地，无法耕种；社内让她拿出往年每亩上的四十担肥料和种籽外，其余一切由社里负责。经初步计算，往年自种时，每亩仅产粗粮两石，今年经过社内加工加肥、精耕细作后，每亩就能产到三石三斗。秋收后，每亩给她两石一斗，其余增产部分作为社内加工加肥费用。这样做，使社员和困难户互不吃亏，都有利益。另外，再让她在社内做些轻便活，得些劳动日分红。另一个办法是对于其它困难户，根据其土地每年需用工数，社内适当抽出劳力加以帮助，保证其生产不低于一般水平。
    开展群众性的信贷工作
    松江省桦川县解放屯共一百零六户。其中有十七户贫困户，他们大都是既缺粮又缺钱，生产生活都很困难。该屯党支部书记高文学，就在支部会上提出开展群众性信贷工作，帮助他们解决困难。会后，由党员带头存款，在两天之内共吸收存款六百三十五万元。根据贷款原则，经过审查批准手续，贷给贫困户，尚余一百多万元送区信贷部存入银行。
    贫困户吴世永用贷款在本屯买了足够的吃粮以后，第二天就到处找粪源，他计划把施肥面积增加两垧。贫困户杨廷贵解决了吃粮问题后，说：“这事多亏支部，我张罗了十多天，自愿出三分利，人家都摇头不借。”贫困户的困难解决了，原来打算放高利贷的梁玉春，就不得不把自己的一百四十万元的余款存到信用合作社去。
    增产计划有了保证
    湖南省澧县青源乡有七十五户困难户。生产困难很多。今年该乡党支部运用互助合作力量，认真帮助困难户分别不同情况，采用不同办法，解决了具体困难，使得全乡今年增产二十多万斤粮食的计划有了保证。困难户熊克友一家六口人，只有他一个劳动力，但是他又生病，不能做重活，重活都要请工，去年光这项开支就是九石五斗谷。今年刘文丰互助组吸收他参加后，分配他做些砍田边、割草、放牛等轻便活，这样一来他今年即可比去年减少九石五斗谷的开支。该乡党支部通过这个办法共解决了四十三户的困难。另外又采用互助组包耕、代耕、佃耕等办法解决了二十三户的困难，还有九户的困难是依靠亲邻解决的。
    帮助困难户参加互助组织
    中共吉林省双阳县委会注意帮助贫困户参加互助合作组织。县委会曾召开县委委员扩大会议，专门研究过如何扶持贫困户参加生产、参加互助合作的问题，并指定一名县委委员负责这项工作。由于县委的重视，很多区村干部也重视了这一工作。六区范家村全村十八户贫困户都参加了互助组。第一区的二百户贫困户，目前已有一百七十户参加了互助组。被吸收入组的贫困户，生产情绪一般都很高。六区的贫困户赵德山参加张国信互助组后，因为生产积极，受到全组欢迎。
    打下全面增产的基础
    山东省沂水县第二区燕家庄乡共七个村，有十八户无劳动力，占全乡总户数的百分之三点三。春耕生产开始，部分乡村干部满足于对农业生产合作社、互助组的春耕生产领导，对无劳动力的单干农民未引起重视。中共燕家庄乡总支根据这种情况，便向群众进行教育，在农民自愿互利的原则下，根据不同情况，采取不同办法解决了全乡无劳动力户的春耕播种困难。生活较好的困难户采取找草、找料的办法，由生产合作社、互助组代耕。有畜力而无劳动力的困难户就以人工换牛工的办法，解决其无劳动力的困难。有女劳动力的困难户，如姚家官庄村王氏有春田三亩六分，由该村建国农业生产合作社帮她耕种，使用的人工和畜力，都折成工分，等到社里有她能做的活时，叫她再还工。生活特别困难，又确实无劳动力者，则采取无代价代耕的办法，帮助解决。如姚家官庄村李大娘八十四岁了，有春田七分，生活又很困难，便由王绪吉互助组自愿无代价地帮助她耕种。由于解决了全乡无劳动力的春耕播种困难，给全面增产打下了良好基础。
    帮助困难户及时春耕
    热河省宁城九区山头村有八户困难户，不但缺吃粮，也没有劳动力。这八户共有六十一亩地，其中二十八亩还缺粪。如薛寡妇十六亩地就有十亩地没有粪。李江常年有病不能劳动，粪还在圈里没往外起，四亩地没有翻。该村党支部在检查备耕中发现了这些问题，立即召开支部会研究解决。经过讨论，大家都明确了根本的办法就是吸收他们参加互助组，但当前必须想一切办法帮助他们搞好春耕生产。于是侯国玺主动用自己犁杖给李江把地翻一遍，把粪送到地里。邢贵给邢林种上地。白永杰借给白景云犁杖，自愿秋后还工钱。这八户困难户就这样解决了当前的春耕困难。
    刘老汉的庄稼种上了
    宁夏省金积县五区补号乡张炳文互助组，在种完庄稼以后，发现单干农民刘连贵老汉因为缺这缺那，地里的活还没有动。该组就开会研究帮助老刘生产的事。大家都说：咱们互助组要很好地团结单干农民，就要很好地帮助他们解决生产困难，引导他们走向组织起来的道路。会后，组员们很快地就把刘老汉三亩地的粪送到地里，还帮助他把庄稼种上。刘老汉感动地说：要不是互助组来帮助，别说能种上，就是别家庄稼长出来了，我的粪也送不到地里去。
