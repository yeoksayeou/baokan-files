    Correctly Implement the Principle of Reasonable Profit Distribution in Capitalist Enterprises
    Fang Xing
    The reasonable distribution of profits in capitalist industry and commerce is a concrete measure to correctly implement the Party and the state's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. In his report to the Central People's Government Committee in September 1953, Chen Yun, Director of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, proposed a principle for the distribution of profits in larger enterprises: that the legitimate profits of the enterprise should be distributed among four parties: state income tax, enterprise public reserve fund, employee welfare bonus, and the capitalist's dividends and bonuses (including remuneration for the capitalist's agents), with the capitalist's dividends and bonuses accounting for about 25 percent of the enterprise's profits. This principle is beneficial to the state's tax revenue, the enterprise's production and operation, and both the employees and private industrialists and merchants. It meets the requirements of the state's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce.
    The profits of capitalist industry and commerce are created by the labor of the working class, and the profits obtained by capitalists come from exploiting the surplus value created by the working class. In the liberated New China, the working class has become the master of the country, and this unreasonable exploitation should not be tolerated. However, because China's economy is still very backward, capitalist industry and commerce will have a positive impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood for a considerable period. Therefore, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of private industrialists and merchants in production and operation, the Chinese working class and the state they lead temporarily allow this exploitation and allow private industrialists and merchants to take a certain amount of profit from the enterprise's profits. As long as they actively carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, strive to improve product quality, reduce costs, save on business management expenses, and expand material exchange business, they may enable the enterprise to obtain more profits, so that their own profits can be better guaranteed. Private industrialists and merchants must have a full understanding of this point, thereby striving for production and operation, loving the country and abiding by the law, giving greater play to the positive role in the national economy and the people's livelihood, and better serving the country and the people.
    As long as private industrialists and merchants actively engage in production and operation, they will have benefits to gain. However, it cannot be unrestricted as in capitalist society. The state must restrict this exploitation through the reasonable distribution of profits. Stipulating that the dividends, bonuses, etc. of private industrialists and merchants can account for about 25 percent of the enterprise's profits draws a clear line between what private industrialists and merchants can and cannot obtain. It is permissible for private industrialists and merchants to distribute profits within this restriction. Exceeding the scope of the restriction, no matter what method is used to take more profits, is illegal. This restricts the scope of activity of the capitalist law of surplus value, preventing them from excessively occupying the interests of the state and the working people. The state also uses this distribution to restrict the development of capitalism, achieving the goal of controlling capital. Because the enthusiasm of private industrialists and merchants is encouraged and their negativity is restricted in this aspect through the reasonable distribution of profits, it cannot but be beneficial for the state to guide them onto the track of state capitalism and state planning, and thereby gradually realize the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    In this principle, it is also clearly stipulated that state income tax and enterprise public reserve fund are two aspects of the distribution of enterprise profits, which is conducive to the state accumulating funds. According to statistics, the proportion of taxes paid by capitalist industry and commerce in the state's income, although it has gradually decreased, still accounts for a considerable proportion. For example, in 1953, it still accounted for 22.36 percent of the state's total budgetary revenue. Among them, private enterprise income tax accounted for 21.12 percent of all industrial and commercial taxes. Therefore, in the distribution of profits, state tax revenue must first be guaranteed, so that all possibilities for domestic accumulation in our country can be transformed into the accumulation of realistic socialist industrialization without omission. This is the long-term interest of the people of the whole country. The behavior of private industrialists and merchants in evading taxes is not allowed. At the same time, the public reserve fund of private enterprises is also an aspect of the accumulation of social funds for national industrialization. For the enterprise itself, it is used to guarantee the enterprise's compensation for losses and expansion of production. Enterprises can use the public reserve fund to add equipment, expand business, improve and enhance the technological foundation of the enterprise, and do a good job in business management. For example, according to statistics from 123 typical private industrial households in Shanghai, their fixed assets increased by 3.4 percent in 1951 compared with 1950, and increased by 4.6 percent in 1952 compared with 1951. Therefore, due to the rapid development of China's economy and the rapid increase in the needs of the people and the state, private enterprises also need to rapidly accumulate funds and expand production. In the past, the general practice of setting aside about 10 percent as the enterprise's public reserve fund was too low and unfavorable to the development of production. In the future, the public reserve fund should be appropriately increased according to the enterprise's situation. Especially in enterprises with profits, it should be encouraged to increase the public reserve fund to facilitate the accumulation of funds. At present, private commercial households who need to change their business should also appropriately increase the public reserve fund in order to create more favorable conditions for the change of business.
    Although the working masses in capitalist enterprises still endure capitalist exploitation, their lives and welfare must be respected and protected. Therefore, employee welfare bonuses should also be an aspect of the profit distribution of private enterprises. This is not only reasonable, but also can appropriately meet the employees' concern for material interests, in order to encourage and stimulate the further play of their enthusiasm for enterprise production and operation, and can protect the safety production of the working masses and improve the labor-capital relations of the enterprise. This is necessary to do a good job in enterprise production and operation, and it is also necessary to ensure that the needs of the people and the country are met. The portion of the enterprise's profits obtained by employees (including employee collective welfare subsidies and employee bonuses) should be allocated in a certain proportion depending on the original wages and welfare facilities of the enterprise. The collective welfare subsidies should be used to run collective welfare undertakings and should generally not be distributed among employees. The bonuses should generally be combined with the enterprise's selection of models and awards for advanced workers, so as to be used to directly promote the enterprise's production and operation.
    Due to the complexity of China's economic situation, there are many small-scale enterprises that are not suitable for the above-mentioned principle of reasonable distribution of profits among the four parties, and the situation is also very complicated. It is impossible to stipulate a universal principle of distribution. The spirit of labor and capital consultation should be emphasized, and profits should be distributed according to custom. Those with no custom or unreasonable custom can negotiate the industry's distribution method through the labor and capital parties of the same industry, and implement it after reporting it to the People's Government for approval.
    In summary, it is very reasonable for private enterprises to distribute profits according to the above-mentioned principles. It is not only good for the country and the working class, but also good for the private industrialists and merchants themselves, and it is also good for private enterprises to improve enterprise production and operation. Therefore, the profit distribution of private enterprises must be based on being beneficial to these four aspects as the criterion.
    In 1953, the profits of private enterprises in various places were very high. The general situation in both large and small cities was: the profit-making area expanded, the number of loss-making households decreased, and the total amount of profits far exceeded that of 1952. For example, taking the accounts reviewed in six major cities, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing, although the area of accounts reviewed last year was smaller than the previous year, the profit income of private enterprises from January to September last year increased by 30 to 66 percent compared with the same period of the previous year. According to a survey of 230 typical households in Shanghai, the profit-making households accounted for only 54.8 percent in the previous year, but expanded to 95.7 percent in the first half of last year. The Shanghai hardware industry lost 19.2 billion yuan in the previous year, but made a profit of 99.5 billion yuan from January to September last year. Some other industries that had difficulties also made profits last year. In short, the profit-making area and the amount of profit were relatively large, and private industrialists and merchants also believed that last year was the year with the most profits since liberation.
    However, at present, some private industrialists and merchants still have a certain degree of misunderstanding, doubt, distortion, and resistance to the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and thus are operating passively, wanting to take advantage of the distribution of profits to withdraw funds. The enterprise's profits have not been distributed according to the above-mentioned reasonable principles. Instead, they have adopted various methods to destroy the principle of reasonable distribution of profits, arbitrarily distributing profits, withdrawing funds, and disregarding the interests of the state and the people. These behaviors are unreasonable and violate the principle of reasonable distribution of profits, and are therefore illegal. This illegal behavior has directly damaged the normal production and operation of enterprises. Many factories have abnormal production because of insufficient funds; some shops cannot get goods because they do not have funds, and their business is not good, while these private industrialists and merchants are squandering waste, regardless of production and operation. This behavior is undoubtedly harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood and the country's construction cause, and is intolerable to the country and the people. Private industrialists and merchants must quickly correct it.
    Based on the above situation, the people's governments in various places must strengthen their leadership over the profit distribution of private enterprises this year. The profit distribution of private enterprises is a relatively complicated issue involving a wide range. There are different profit situations among regions, industries, and factories and stores. Therefore, only the local people's government can strengthen leadership and control can it correctly implement the principle of reasonable distribution. It is wrong to give up leadership and let it go. In particular, we must continue to strengthen the propaganda of the general task of the transition period, eliminate the concerns of private industrialists and merchants, and then actively lead them to reasonably distribute profits, prevent and stop their wrong behavior of arbitrarily distributing profits to withdraw funds.
    Secondly, the distribution of profits must fully implement the spirit of labor-capital consultation. Since the enterprise's profit distribution is directly related to the interests of both labor and capital, only through labor-capital consultation can the principle of reasonable distribution of profits be grasped seriously and flexibly according to the specific situation of the enterprise, and this is also a positive behavior to win the leadership and supervision of the working masses. Therefore, the enterprise's profit distribution ratio must be determined through labor-capital consultation to make the enterprise's profit distribution more fair and reasonable.
    Finally, private industrialists and merchants should reasonably distribute profits with a positive attitude of production and operation and patriotism and law-abiding, correct and stop all illegal behaviors of arbitrarily distributing profits, so that the enterprise's profit distribution is beneficial to production and operation, not harmful, so as to be beneficial to the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation cause, not harmful, so that they can contribute their own strength in the cause of national socialist construction.

    在资本主义企业中正确贯彻盈余合理分配的原则
    方行
    资本主义工商业盈余的合理分配，是正确贯彻党和国家对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造政策的一项具体措施。中央财政经济委员会陈云主任一九五三年九月在中央人民政府委员会的报告中，对较大企业的盈余分配提出了一个原则：即在企业的正当盈利中，按国家所得税，企业公积金，职工福利奖金，资方的股息、红利（包括资方代理人的酬劳金在内）等四方面分配，资方的股息、红利等可占到企业利润的百分之二十五左右。这一原则对国家税收、企业生产经营、职工与私营工商业者四方面都有利，符合国家对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造政策的要求。
    资本主义工商业的盈余是工人阶级的劳动创造出来的，资本家所分得的利润是剥削工人阶级创造的剩余价值而来的。在解放了的新中国，工人阶级成了国家的主人翁，对这种不合理的剥削，本应是不能容忍的。但由于我国经济还很落后，在相当长的时期内，资本主义工商业还有有利于国计民生的一面。所以为了鼓舞私营工商业者生产经营的积极性，中国工人阶级和他们领导的国家暂时容许这种剥削，允许私营工商业者从企业盈余中分取一定的利润。并且只要他们积极开展增产节约运动，努力提高产品质量，降低成本，节约经营管理费用，扩大物资交流业务，就可能使企业获得更多的盈余，使他们自己的利润也就能获得更多的保证。私营工商业者对这一点必须有充分的认识，从而努力生产经营，爱国守法，更多地发挥对于国计民生的积极作用，更好地为国家人民服务。
    私营工商业者只要积极生产经营，便有利可得。但不能像在资本主义社会那样不受限制。国家要通过盈余的合理分配来限制这种剥削。规定私营工商业者的股息、红利等可占到企业盈余的百分之二十五左右，这就划清了私营工商业者能够获得与不能获得的界限，私营工商业者在这一限制范围内分配盈余是允许的，超过限制的范围，不管用什么方式分取更多的利润都是违法的。这就限制了资本主义剩余价值法则的活动范围，使他们不能过多地占有国家和劳动人民的利益，并且国家也通过了这种分配限制了资本主义的发展，达到了节制资本的目的。由于通过合理地分配盈余，在这一方面使私营工商业者的积极性受到鼓励，消极性受到限制，这就不能不有利于国家将其引导到国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道上来，并由此逐步实现国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    在这一原则中，又明确规定了国家所得税和企业公积金为分配企业盈余的两个方面，这是有利于国家积累资金的。根据统计资料，资本主义工商业缴纳的税款所占国家收入的比重，虽已逐渐降低，但仍占有相当比重，如一九五三年仍占国家全部预算收入的百分之二十二·三六。其中私营企业所得税占全部工商税的百分之二十一·一二。因此，在盈余分配中，首先要保证国家税收，使我国国内积累的一切可能性，都能毫不遗漏地变为现实的社会主义工业化的积累，这是全国人民的长远利益所在。私营工商业者偷税漏税的行为，是不能容许的。同时，私营企业的公积金也是国家工业化社会资金积累的一个方面，对企业本身来说，是作为保障企业弥补亏损和扩大生产的用途。企业可以凭借公积金来增添设备，扩大业务，改进与提高企业的技术基础，搞好经营管理。如根据上海一二三家私营典型工业户的统计，其固定资产一九五一年较一九五○年增加了百分之三·四，一九五二年又较一九五一年增加百分之四·六。因此，由于我国经济的迅速发展，人民和国家的需要迅速增加，也就需要私营企业迅速积累资金，扩大生产，过去一般提百分之一○左右作为企业的公积金，是太低了，不利于发展生产，今后应该根据企业情况，适当地多提公积金，尤其在有盈余的企业，更应鼓励多提公积金，以利于积累资金。目前需要转业的私营商业户，为了替转业创造更有利的条件，也应适当地多提公积金。
    资本主义企业中的工人群众虽然还忍受着资本主义的剥削，但是他们的生活福利是必须受到尊重和予以保护的。因此，职工福利奖金也应该是私营企业盈余分配的一方面，这不但合情合理，而且这样也能适当满足职工对物质利益的关心，以鼓励与刺激其对企业生产经营积极性的进一步发挥，并可以保护工人群众的安全生产，改进企业的劳资关系。这是搞好企业生产经营所必需的，也是保证满足人民和国家的需要所必需的。职工在企业盈余中所得部分（包括职工集体福利补助金与职工奖励金），应视企业原有工资与福利设施的情况，分配一定的比例。其集体福利补助金应用作举办集体福利事业之用，一般不应在职工中分配，其奖励金一般应结合企业评选模范，奖励先进工作者，以用在直接推动企业生产经营之上。
    由于中国经济情况的复杂，不适用上述四方面合理分配盈余原则的小规模企业，户数甚多，情况也很复杂，不可能规定一条通用的分配原则。应该是强调劳资双方协商办事的精神，按惯例进行盈余分配。其无惯例或惯例不合理者，可以通过该同业劳资双方协商行业的分配办法，报经人民政府核准后实行。
    综上所述，私营企业根据上述原则分配盈余，是非常合理的，不但对国家与工人阶级有好处，对私营工商业者个人有好处，对私营企业改善企业生产经营也是有好处的。因此，私营企业的盈余分配必须以对这四方面有利为准则。
    一九五三年各地私营企业盈余很多，不分大小城市普遍的情况是：盈余面扩大，亏损户减少，盈余总额远远超过一九五二年，如以天津、北京、武汉、广州、西安、重庆六大城市的查账评议户为例，虽然去年查账评议户的面比前年缩小，但去年一至九月份私营企业盈余所得比前年同期还增加了百分之三十至六十六。根据上海二百三十户典型户的调查，前年盈余户仅占百分之五四·八，去年上半年扩大为百分之九五·七。上海五金工业前年亏损一百九十二亿元，去年一至九月就盈余九百九十五亿元。其他一些有困难的行业，去年也获得了盈余。总之盈余面与盈余额都是比较大的，私营工商业者也认为去年是解放后盈余最多的一年。
    但目前有部分私营工商业者，对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，还存在着一定程度的误解、疑虑、歪曲和抗拒，因而经营消极，想借分红抽逃资金，对企业盈余并未按照上述合理原则进行分配，反而采用各种方法，来破坏合理分配盈余的原则，乱分盈余，抽走资金，置国家和人民的利益于不顾，这些行为都是不合理的，是违背合理分配盈余原则，因而也是不合法的。这种违法行为已直接破坏了企业正常的生产和经营，许多工厂因为资金不足生产不正常；有些商店因为没有资金进不了货，营业不好，而这些私营工商业者却在挥霍浪费，不管生产经营。这种行为无疑是有害于国计民生和国家建设事业的，是为国家和人民所不能容许的，私营工商业者必须迅速加以纠正。
    基于上述情况，各地人民政府对今年私营企业的盈余分配必须加强领导。私营企业的盈余分配是一个比较复杂而牵涉较广的问题，各地区、各行业、各厂店之间存在着不同的盈余情况，因此，只有当地人民政府加强领导和掌握，才能正确地贯彻合理分配的原则。放弃领导，任其自流，是不对的。尤其是，必须针对目前私营工商业者滥分盈余的错误思想与行为，继续加强对过渡时期总任务的宣传，消除私营工商业者的顾虑，然后积极领导他们合理地进行盈余分配，防止并制止他们滥分盈余以抽逃资金的错误行为。
    其次，盈余分配必须充分贯彻劳资协商的精神。由于企业的盈余分配，直接关联到劳资双方的利益，只有通过劳资协商，才能根据本企业具体情况，严肃而灵活地掌握合理分配盈余的原则，并且这也是争取工人群众领导和监督的积极行为。因此，必须通过劳资协商，确定企业盈余分配比例，使企业的盈余分配更趋公平合理。
    最后，私营工商业者应以积极生产经营与爱国守法的态度，合理分配盈余，纠正和停止一切滥分盈余的不法行为，使企业的盈余分配对生产经营有利，而不是有害，从而对国家社会主义工业化与社会主义改造事业有利，而不是有害，使自己在国家社会主义建设的事业中，贡献出自己的力量。
