Southwest Region Actively Prepares to Organize Higher Primary School Graduates to Participate in Production
    Various parts of the Southwest region are actively carrying out preparations for this year's higher primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production. The Southwest Education Bureau and the Southwest Committee of the Communist Youth League, along with relevant units, have jointly dispatched work teams to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and other places to focus on understanding the participation of primary and secondary school graduates in production and to assist local areas in launching propaganda and education work. The education departments of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, as well as the Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau, have convened special meetings to study labor education issues, actively organizing local teachers to study the People's Daily editorial on organizing higher primary school graduates to participate in agricultural labor. Nanchong, Qingshen, Xuyong, Jiajiang, and other counties in Sichuan Province have also conducted typical investigations into the participation of local higher primary school graduates in agricultural production, using concrete materials to educate students about the glory of labor. Under the unified leadership of the district committee, the Sixth District of Chongqing Municipality has conducted in-depth propaganda to the masses through holding forums for graduates participating in production, meetings for parents of students, and People's Congress meetings. At the meeting of representatives of higher primary and junior middle school graduates held in Changshou County on May 3rd, more than 140 representatives expressed their willingness to obey the needs of the country, participate in agricultural production, and increase grain production for the motherland.
