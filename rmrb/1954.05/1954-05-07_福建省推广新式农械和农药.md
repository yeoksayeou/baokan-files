    State-owned factories in Northeast China, Shanghai and other places will manufacture 1,416 units of seven types of new agricultural machinery, including air pressure sprayers and hand-cranked sprayers, and 72,170 jin of ten types of pesticides, including calcium arsenate and rotenone, for farmers in Fujian Province this year. The first batch of agricultural pesticides and machinery has already been shipped to Fujian Province.
    The Fujian Provincial Cooperative Headquarters has already transferred more than 200 units of new agricultural machinery and more than 40,000 jin of pesticides to four wholesale stations in Jianyang, Nanping, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou in early March. The wholesale stations will then distribute them to various places to supply farmers. At the same time, the Fujian Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture has dispatched 20 technical cadres to form four promotion teams to go to various places for technical guidance. At present, they have conducted technical training on the use of agricultural machinery and pesticides, as well as the assembly and disassembly of agricultural machinery, in eight special districts. The department has also compiled and printed "Methods for Using Several Agricultural Pest and Disease Medicines and Machinery," which has been distributed to better agricultural production cooperatives in various places.
