    The whole people of the Soviet Union are warmly celebrating the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. Last December, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a resolution stipulating a wide celebration of this major historical event. On May 23, grand celebration rallies were held throughout the Soviet Union, and parades were held in Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, in Kharkov, Pereyaslav-Khmelnitsky, Rovno, as well as Sevastopol and Odessa; a parade will also be held in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, on May 30. These enthusiastic and jubilant celebrations by the Soviet people fully demonstrate the friendship and unity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.
    The reunification of Ukraine with Russia was determined by the development of economic, political and cultural relations between these two brotherly Slavic nations over many centuries, and it conformed to the vital interests and aspirations of both nations. The Ukrainian people, in January 1654 at the Pereyaslav Rada, declared with firm will the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, linking their destiny forever with the brotherly Russian people. This merger greatly promoted the consolidation of Russia, enhanced its international prestige, and had great progressive significance for the future political, economic and cultural development of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples . From then on, the Ukrainian people, together with the Russian people, fought against their common enemies—Tsarist rule, feudal lords, capitalists, and foreign invaders—and achieved victory. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party established by the great Lenin, under the banner of proletarian internationalism, the Ukrainian people, following the Russian people, first embarked on the path of the October Socialist Revolution, realizing their generations-long dream of establishing a truly free and autonomous nation-state. In the big family of Soviet republics, in the struggle of the civil war and against foreign military intervention, in the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War, in the great cause of building socialism and communism, the friendship between the Ukrainian people, the Russian people, and the people of other nationalities of the Soviet Union has been tempered and consolidated.
    The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the big family of friendship and unity of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, has achieved genuine prosperity and upsurge in economy and culture. The growth of Soviet national strength has enabled the Ukrainian people to realize their desire to reunite the Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, with its strong industry, advanced agriculture, and constantly developing cultural and artistic achievements, has become one of the most powerful countries in Europe. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Ukrainian people, together with the people of all other nationalities of the Soviet Union, are advancing confidently along the path of communism and making important contributions to the cause of world peace.
    Facts have proved that the unbreakable friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian peoples and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, the strengthening and consolidation of the Soviet multinational state, are the guarantee of the national independence and freedom, the development of national culture, and the prosperity of life of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. Therefore, this major historical event of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia is not only a great festival for the Ukrainian and Russian peoples, but also a national festival for the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. This great festival embodies the victory of the friendship and unity of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the victory of the idea of peace and friendship among all nationalities. The entire historical experience of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union proves that the free union and close cooperation of all nationalities on the basis of socialism cannot be shaken by any force.
    The great Lenin formulated the party's theoretical program and policy on the national question in the history of Marxism, explaining that the national question is an integral part of the revolutionary struggle of the entire working class for the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin's programmatic instructions have been further and creatively developed in Stalin's writings and in the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union defends the principle of proletarian internationalism and implements the policy of equality and friendship among all nationalities. The Soviet multinational state, built on the basis of the great Leninist national policy, has brilliantly solved the national question and the problem of national cooperation, enabling all nationalities of the Soviet Union without exception to achieve prosperity and happiness. Now, all nationalities of the Soviet Union have developed into advanced new socialist nations. All this provides a model for multinational countries to solve their national problems. The fraternal cooperation and happy life of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union inspire the struggle of oppressed nations around the world for independence and freedom.
    According to bourgeois "theories," national equality and the united cooperation and common development of many nationalities are impossible. Bourgeois "theories" divide nations into superior nations and inferior nations, superior nations should rule inferior nations, and inferior nations should be content with the humiliating status of being ruled and exploited; the development of one nation must come from the suffering and sacrifice of another nation. The bourgeoisie uses this "theory" to justify the inhuman colonial system and to defend the oppression of one nation by another. The German, Italian and Japanese fascist gangs and the current American imperialists are so arrogant as to think that all nations in the world should be ruled by them, and only such a world is called the so-called "free world." The Soviet example completely shattered these bourgeois fallacies, proving with conclusive facts that national equality and the united cooperation and common development among all nationalities are entirely possible; the ugly system of national oppression and the colonial system should be completely eliminated. Lenin's theory on socialist revolution, socialist construction and the national question, and the national policy and achievements of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have epoch-making world significance.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China ended the long-term oppression and enslavement of China by imperialism and established a big family of friendly, mutually-assisting and cooperative nationalities. This is a tremendous change in the historical face of China. For more than four years, in the process of gradually transitioning to a socialist society, our motherland has been implementing the general task of the Chinese Communist Party on the national question: to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and to jointly build the big family of the motherland; within the unified big family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all rights of all nationalities and to implement national regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, to gradually develop the politics, economy and culture of all nationalities, to gradually eliminate the de facto inequalities left over from history among the nationalities, so that backward nationalities can be among the advanced nationalities, and gradually transition to a socialist society. The significant achievements already made in our country's ethnic work have brilliantly proved the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist theory of nationalities and the ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party. The continuous enhancement of the brotherly unity and friendship among the various nationalities in our country has greatly strengthened the power of our country. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class, like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet working class, will resolutely lead the minority nationalities and the Han people in our country into socialism and jointly enjoy the prosperous and happy life of socialism in the future. The Soviet example is very useful for the people of all nationalities in our country, and it will strengthen the unity of all nationalities in our country, and with full confidence, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, strive for a bright future.
    The fraternal alliance and close cooperation of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union have made the Soviet Union a strong fortress of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and a fortress of peace, freedom, and independence for all nationalities. The victory of the Chinese people in breaking the shackles of imperialist oppression and the achievements of the Chinese people of all nationalities in jointly building the cause of socialism have given a fatal blow to the entire imperialist colonial system, raising the national liberation movement of oppressed nations in the East to a new and higher stage.
    It is precisely because of this that the imperialist reactionary groups are furious, adopting a hostile policy towards the victorious cause of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and China, and are constantly trying to send spies and saboteurs to the Soviet Union and our country, using the remnants of the crushed counter-revolutionary groups to carry out sabotage activities. American imperialists openly appear as neo-colonialists, wantonly infringing upon the independent sovereignty of various countries, organizing military aggressive groups, and trying their best to suppress national liberation movements, attempting to establish a new colonial empire and dominate the world.
    The experience of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union proves that we must be vigilant against the insatiable imperialism and their agents, as well as the conspiracies of all kinds of bourgeois nationalists and other traitors, unremittingly educate the people with internationalism and patriotism, strengthen the unity of the people of all nationalities at home, and strive for friendly and peaceful relations between the people of all countries in order to defend the long-term interests of the people of all nationalities and the cause of safeguarding world lasting peace and universal security.
    All the peace-loving and freedom-seeking people in the world regard the continuous consolidation of the multinational state and the victory of building communism of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union as the victory of the great cause of peace and friendship of the people of all countries and all nationalities. The people of all countries in the world will fight unremittingly against imperialist oppression and war policies, strive to ease international tensions, and safeguard world peace with full confidence.

### 各民族友爱团结的伟大榜样

    各民族友爱团结的伟大榜样
    苏联全国人民正在热烈庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯的三百周年纪念。去年十二月，苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议、苏联最高苏维埃主席团通过决议，规定广泛庆祝这个重大的历史事件。五月二十三日，苏联各地举行了盛大的庆祝集会，在乌克兰共和国首都基辅、在哈尔科夫、佩雷雅斯拉夫—赫米尔尼茨基、罗夫，以及塞瓦斯托波尔和敖德萨举行了阅兵式；苏联首都莫斯科也将于五月三十日举行阅兵式。苏联人民这种热情的、欢欣鼓舞的庆祝活动，充分显示了苏联各族人民的友爱团结。
    乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯是这两个兄弟斯拉夫民族在过去许多世纪中的经济、政治和文化关系的发展所决定的，它符合于这两个民族的切身利益和愿望。乌克兰人民在一六五四年一月在佩雷雅斯拉夫议会上以坚强的意志宣布乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯，把他们的命运永远与兄弟的俄罗斯人民联系在一起。这次合并在许多方面促进了俄国的巩固，提高了它的国际威望，对于乌克兰和俄罗斯人民的未来的政治、经济和文化发展具有巨大的进步意义。从此以后，乌克兰人民与俄罗斯人民在一起，对他们的共同敌人——沙皇统治、封建主和资本家以及外国侵略者进行了斗争，并取得了胜利。乌克兰人民在伟大的列宁所建立起来的布尔什维克党的领导之下，在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，继俄罗斯人民之后首先走上了十月社会主义革命的道路，实现了他们世世代代的梦想——建立一个真正自由的、自主的民族国家。在苏维埃共和国的大家庭中，在内战和反对外国军事干涉的斗争中，在伟大的卫国战争的艰苦年代中，在建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业中，乌克兰人民和俄罗斯人民及苏联其他各民族人民的友谊锻炼得更加巩固了。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国在苏联各民族友爱团结的大家庭中，取得了经济和文化的真正繁荣和高涨。苏联国力的增长，使乌克兰人民实现了他们重新统一乌克兰领土的愿望。乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国由于它的强大的工业，先进的农业，和不断发展的文化和艺术的成就，已成为欧洲的最强大的国家之一。乌克兰人民在共产党的领导下，正和苏联其他各族人民一道，信心百倍地沿着共产主义的道路前进，并对世界和平事业作出重要的贡献。
    事实证明，乌克兰和俄罗斯人民以及苏联各族人民的牢不可破的友谊，苏维埃多民族国家的加强和巩固，是苏联各族人民的民族独立和自由、民族文化发展和生活繁荣的保证。因此，乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯的这个重大历史事件，不仅是乌克兰和俄罗斯人民的伟大节日，而且也是苏联各民族人民的一个全民节日。这个伟大的节日，体现了苏联各族人民友爱团结的胜利，体现了各族人民间和平与友好的思想的胜利。苏联各族人民的全部历史经验，证明了各民族在社会主义基础上的自由联合和紧密合作，是任何势力所不能动摇的。
    伟大的列宁在马克思主义历史上制定了党关于民族问题的理论纲领和政策，说明了民族问题是整个工人阶级争取无产阶级专政的革命斗争的一个组成部分。列宁这个纲领性的指示在斯大林的著作及苏联共产党的决议中，得到了进一步的、创造性的发挥。苏联共产党捍卫着无产阶级国际主义原则，贯彻执行各民族平等和友好的政策。在伟大的列宁主义的民族政策的基础上建立起来的苏维埃多民族国家，光辉地解决了民族问题和民族合作问题，使苏联所有各民族无例外地得到富强和幸福。现在，苏联所有各民族都已经发展为先进的新型的社会主义民族了。这一切就为多民族国家解决自己的民族问题提供了典范。苏联各民族人民的友爱合作和他们的幸福生活，鼓舞着全世界被压迫民族争取独立和自由的斗争。
    按照资产阶级的“理论”，民族平等和许多民族的团结合作、共同发展，是不可能的。资产阶级的“理论”把民族分成为优等民族和劣等民族，优等民族应该统治劣等民族，而劣等民族则应该安于被统治被剥削的屈辱地位；一个民族的发展必须从另一个民族的苦难和牺牲中得来。资产阶级用这种
  “理论”来辩护惨无人道的殖民制度，辩护一个民族对另一个民族的压迫。德意日法西斯匪帮和现在的美国帝国主义者，竟狂妄到这样的程度，似乎世界上一切民族都应该由他们来统治，只有这样的世界才叫做所谓“自由世界”。苏联的榜样完全粉碎了这些资产阶级的谬论，以确凿的事实证明了，民族平等和各民族之间的团结合作、共同发展，是完全做得到的；丑恶的民族压迫制度和殖民制度是完全应该被消灭的。列宁关于社会主义革命、社会主义建设与民族问题的理论，和苏联共产党、苏联政府的民族政策及其成就，具有划时代的世界意义。
    中国革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，结束了帝国主义对中国的长期压迫和奴役，建立了各民族友爱互助合作的大家庭。这是中国的历史面貌的巨大变化。四年多以来，我们的祖国在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的过程中，执行着中国共产党在民族问题方面的总任务：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族之列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。我国民族工作已经获得的重大成就，光辉地证明了马克思列宁主义的民族学说和中国共产党的民族政策的正确性。我国各民族间兄弟般的团结和友谊的不断增进，大大加强了我们国家的威力。中国共产党和中国工人阶级也将像苏联共产党和苏联工人阶级一样，坚决领导我国少数民族人民和汉族人民一道进入社会主义，共同在将来享受社会主义的繁荣幸福生活。苏联的榜样，对于我国各族人民是很有用的，它将加强我国各民族的团结，信心百倍地在中国共产党与中央人民政府的领导下，为美好的将来而奋斗。
    苏联各族人民的兄弟联盟和紧密合作，使苏联成为和平民主和社会主义阵营的强大堡垒，成为各民族和平、自由和独立的堡垒。中国人民打破帝国主义压迫的枷锁的胜利，中国各族人民共同建设社会主义事业的成就，给了整个帝国主义殖民制度以致命的打击，把东方被压迫民族争取独立自由的民族解放运动提到了新的更高的阶段。
    正是因为这样，帝国主义反动集团暴跳如雷，对苏联和中国各族人民的胜利的事业采取敌视的政策，无时无刻不在设法把间谍和破坏分子派到苏联和我国来，利用已被粉碎的反革命集团的残余分子进行破坏活动。美帝国主义者公然以新殖民主义者的面目出现，恣意侵犯各国的独立主权，组织军事性的侵略集团，竭力镇压民族解放运动，妄想建立新殖民帝国，称霸世界。
    苏联各族人民的经验证明，必须对贪得无厌的帝国主义和他们的代理人以及形形色色的资产阶级民族主义分子和其他叛徒的阴谋提高警惕，不懈地以国际主义和爱国主义教育人民，加强国内各族人民的团结，争取各国人民间的友好与和平关系，才能保卫各族人民的长远利益，保卫世界持久和平与普遍安全的事业。
    全世界爱好和平、争取独立自由的人民，都把苏联各族人民不断巩固自己的多民族国家和建设共产主义的胜利，看作是各国各族人民的和平与友好的伟大事业的胜利。世界各国人民将信心百倍地为反对帝国主义的压迫和战争政策，争取缓和国际紧张局势，维护世界和平，而进行不懈的斗争。
