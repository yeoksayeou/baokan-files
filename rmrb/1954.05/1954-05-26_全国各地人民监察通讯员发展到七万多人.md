　　People's supervision organs in various parts of the country have generally developed organizations of people's supervision correspondents since last year. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 78,196 people's supervision correspondents across the country, an increase of nearly three times compared to 1952. Under the leadership of the supervision committees at all levels and the supervision offices of various departments, and with the active support of the Communist Party and the People's Government organs, the people's supervision correspondents have diligently undertaken their glorious duties, exposing the mistakes and shortcomings of state organs, enterprise departments, and their staff. According to statistics from only seven provinces including Anhui and Jiangsu, and six cities including Nanjing and Harbin, people's supervision correspondents directly exposed, and the people reflected and exposed, more than 14,000 problems in the past year alone.

　　People's supervision correspondents pay great attention to supervising and inspecting the country's economic construction work. The people's supervision correspondents were very active in the increase production and practice economy movement in various places, constantly criticizing and suggesting unreasonable phenomena in production. Some employees of the Nanchang City Enterprise Company Button Factory, in order to earn more wages, simply pursued an increase in production quantity, manufacturing crudely, resulting in poor product quality and a high rate of defective and substandard products. Although opinions had been raised many times about this phenomenon, it had not been resolved. At the beginning of the increase production and practice economy movement, the people's supervision correspondents held a meeting to study and suggest that the factory leadership implement strict inspections of product quality, and publish the daily product quantity, quality, and defective and substandard product situation on the blackboard newspaper, commending those with excellent results and criticizing those with poor results. This gradually reversed the abnormal production situation, product quality improved, and the employee absenteeism rate also dropped from 10% in the past to 1.04%. After Engineer Li Kaiyu of the North China Design Branch of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government proposed the opinion of "lowering two meters and reducing one bridge hole" for a river bridge project that was originally improperly designed, the administrative leadership did not pay attention to this suggestion. Li Kaiyu reported this problem to the supervision correspondent of the Design Bureau. The supervision correspondent actively supported his opinion and reported it to the Bureau Chief of the Bureau, and reported it to the People's Supervision Office of the Ministry of Railways and the North China Design Branch. This aroused the attention of the North China Design Branch. After detailed research and comparison, Li Engineer's suggestion was finally adopted, saving the state approximately 3 billion yuan in expenses. As for those illegal acts that infringe upon the interests of the state and the people and steal state property, the people's supervision correspondents can conduct resolute struggles after discovering them. Yang Rongsheng, the head of Li'an Township, Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to deceive the government, attempting to purchase public property worth more than 10 million yuan for 6 million yuan in order to obtain huge profits. After being exposed by the people's supervision correspondent of Li'an Township and handled by the People's Government, Yang Rongsheng's theft was cracked down, and state property was protected.

　　People's supervision correspondents also pay attention to supervising and inspecting the policies and decrees of the People's Government. Xiong Fangli of Hetou Township, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, relying on the power of his cousin Xiong Guanhao (Deputy District Chief and Presiding Judge of the District People's Court), falsely accused Xiong Maolin of sabotaging production and having "historical problems," and tied up Xiong Maolin and sent him to the district to avenge personal grudges. Xiong Guanhao then sentenced Xiong Maolin to three years in prison. After this false accusation occurred, some people were dissatisfied in their hearts, but dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Su Songmao, a people's supervision correspondent of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, was building a sluice gate project in Hetou Township at this time. After discovering this problem, he immediately reported it to the Supervision Committee of the Provincial People's Government. After investigation, it was proven that Xiong Fangli was indeed taking revenge. After the leadership organs decided to remove Xiong Guanhao from his post and ordered him to conduct a profound self-criticism to the local masses; at the same time, Xiong Fangli was sent to the court for punishment; an apology and comfort were given to Xiong Maolin, and a relief fund of 400,000 yuan was issued. After the problem was resolved, it was warmly supported by the local masses.

### 全国各地人民监察通讯员发展到七万多人

    全国各地人民监察通讯员发展到七万多人
    全国各地人民监察机关从去年以来，普遍发展了人民监察通讯员的组织。据不完全统计，目前全国已有人民监察通讯员七万八千一百九十六人，比一九五二年增加将近三倍。人民监察通讯员在各级监察委员会和各部门监察室的领导下，并且受到共产党和人民政府机关的积极支持，努力地担负了自己的光荣职务，揭发了国家机关、企业部门及其工作人员中的错误和缺点。仅据安徽、江苏等七个省和南京、哈尔滨等六个市的统计，去年一年来人民监察通讯员直接揭发以及人民群众向他们反映和揭发的问题就有一万四千多件。
    人民监察通讯员都很注意对国家的经济建设工作进行监督检查。在各地的增产节约运动中，人民监察通讯员非常活跃，不断对生产中的不合理现象提出批评和建议。南昌市企业公司钮扣厂有些职工为了多得工资，单纯追求提高生产数量，粗制滥造，以致产品质量低劣，废品和次品率很高。这种现象虽曾有人提过多次意见，但都没得到解决。增产节约运动开始时，人民监察通讯员便开会研究建议厂的领导方面对产品质量实行严格的检查，并把每天的产品数量、质量和废品、次品情况在黑板报上公布，对成绩优良的给以表扬，对成绩不好的给以批评。这样便逐渐扭转了不正常的生产情况，产品的质量提高了，职工缺勤率也由过去的百分之十降低到百分之一点零四。中央人民政府铁道部设计局华北设计分局李开域工程师对原来设计不当的一个河桥工程提出“降低两公尺，减少一桥孔”的意见以后，行政领导方面并没有重视这个建议。李开域便向设计局监察通讯员反映了这一问题，监察通讯员积极支持了他的意见，除向本局局长报告外，并报告了铁道部人民监察室和华北设计分局。因此引起了华北设计分局的重视，经过详细研究和比较，最后采纳了李工程师的建议，给国家节省开支约三十亿元左右。至于对于那些侵犯国家和人民利益以及盗窃国家资财的不法行为，人民监察通讯员发现以后都能进行坚决的斗争。四川省武胜县礼安乡乡长杨荣盛勾结奸商欺骗政府，企图以六百万元购买价值一千多万元的公产，从中获取暴利。经礼安乡人民监察通讯员揭发并经人民政府处理以后，打击了杨荣盛的盗窃行为，保护了国家财产。
    人民监察通讯员还注意对人民政府的政策、法令进行监督检查。江西省南昌县河头乡熊方立依仗其堂兄熊观浩（副区长兼区人民法庭审判长）的威势，诬告熊懋麟破坏生产，有“历史问题”，把熊懋麟捆绑送区，以报私仇。熊观浩便判处熊懋麟徒刑三年。这一诬告事件发生后，有些群众虽然心中不满，但敢怒而不敢言。江西省人民政府农林厅水利局人民监察通讯员苏松茂这时正在河头乡建设水闸工程，发现了这一问题后，立即报告了省人民政府监察委员会。经过调查，证明熊方立确实是报复行为，经领导机关决定将熊观浩撤职，并令其向当地群众作深刻检讨；同时将熊方立送法院惩办；对熊懋麟进行了道歉和安慰，并发给救济金四十万元。问题处理以后，受到当地群众的热烈拥护。
