Various levels of People's Governments in Zhejiang Province are actively leading farmers to plant sunflowers. The Ningbo Administrative Office requires farmers to "plant more and increase production in every household" under the principle of not affecting grain crop production, and calls on all government offices, organizations, and schools to use vacant land for planting. Fuyang County called on cadres at all levels to mobilize farmers to plant more sunflowers on available land, and instructed supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase sunflower seeds from outside to solve the problem of seed shortages for the masses. In addition, cadres were sent to key townships to summarize the experience of the masses in achieving high sunflower yields. Farmers in Changhe District, Xiaoshan County, responded to the government's call and guaranteed a minimum planting of twenty to thirty plants per household. Haiyan, Chongde, Jinhua, Xiaoshan, Hangxian and other counties have all purchased sunflower seeds from other places to supply farmers for planting.

To help various areas solve the problem of insufficient sunflower seeds, the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Company and the Provincial Cooperative Federation decided that the Oils and Fats Company would purchase 50,000 jin of sunflower seeds and distribute them to areas with convenient transportation and fertile soil, which will be distributed to farmers for planting through county supply and marketing cooperatives. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued a notice to all counties, requiring agricultural and forestry departments to strengthen technical guidance, pay attention to guiding pest and disease prevention, and artificial pollination.

    浙江省各地推广种植向日葵
    浙江省各地人民政府积极领导农民种植向日葵。宁波专署要求农民在不影响粮食作物生产的原则下，做到“户户多种，家家增产”，并号召各机关、团体、学校利用空地种植。富阳县号召各级干部发动农民利用空隙土地多种向日葵，并责成供销合作社向外采购向日葵种籽，解决群众缺种的困难。此外，还派干部深入基点乡，总结群众的向日葵丰产经验。萧山县长河区农民，响应政府的号召，保证每户最少种植二十到三十株。海盐、崇德、金华、萧山、杭县等县都纷纷向外地买向日葵种籽，供应农民种植。
    中国油脂公司浙江省公司和省合作社联合社为帮助各地解决向日葵种籽不够的问题，决定由油脂公司采购向日葵种籽五万斤，分发交通运输便利及土质肥厚的地区，通过各县供销合作社配销农民种植。省人民政府农林厅向各县发出了通知，要求农林部门加强技术指导，注意指导防虫、防病及人工传粉。
