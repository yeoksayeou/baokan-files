    Carry Forward the Fighting Tradition of the "May Fourth" Literary Revolution
    Zhou Yang
    The May Fourth Movement was a great revolutionary movement against imperialism and feudalism, and also a great movement for cultural innovation. Comrade Mao Zedong gave a very high evaluation of this cultural innovation movement in "On New Democracy." He said:
    "The cultural revolution carried out by the May Fourth Movement was a movement that thoroughly opposed feudal culture. Since Chinese history, there has never been such a great and thorough cultural revolution. At that time, opposing the old morality and advocating the new morality, opposing the old literature and advocating the new literature were the two major banners of the cultural revolution, and they made great contributions."
    And Lu Xun, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, was this "chief general of the cultural revolution" and "the greatest and most heroic standard-bearer."
    It has been thirty-five years since the May Fourth Movement. The New Democratic Revolution, which began with the "May Fourth", has achieved complete victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. Our people are carrying out creative labor and arduous struggle to build our motherland into a new socialist country. The people's literature and art movement, which began with the "May Fourth", is developing on an unprecedentedly large scale, along the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative principles of socialist realism.
      The "May Fourth" Literary Revolution put forward the principle of realism in literature and art, the principle of literature and art serving the interests of the people and society, and created literary works that described the real life and struggle of the people in a language close to the masses and reflected the democratic revolutionary demands of the people. This was a completely new phenomenon that had never existed in the history of Chinese literature. The "May Fourth" Literary Revolution, regardless of what shortcomings and limitations it had in theory and creative practice, was the first truly great revolution in the history of Chinese literature. It is no exaggeration to say that without this literary revolution, there would be no people's literature and art movement today.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942 and the changes it caused in literature and art were a continuation and development of the "May Fourth" Literary Revolution under new historical conditions. Based on Marxist-Leninist theory, Comrade Mao Zedong comprehensively and critically summarized the historical experience of the new literature movement since the "May Fourth", prompting our literature and art movement to enter a new stage.
    Sorting out and studying the "May Fourth" literary heritage, inheriting and carrying forward all the excellent and correct traditions, is an important task in our literature and art work.
    What exactly are the good traditions left to us by the "May Fourth" Literary Revolution?
    This literary revolution, as a form of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle, its strength lies first of all in its thoroughness and determination in opposing feudal culture. Lu Xun's "A Madman's Diary," the first work of Chinese new literature, is a declaration of war against feudalism, full of righteousness and courage. It burned like a raging fire the entire mask of feudal patriarchal ideology and system, ruthlessly exposing the man-eating essence of feudal ethics that had existed for thousands of years. It issued a warning: "In the future, those who eat people will not be allowed to live in the world," calling on people to live the life of "real people."
    The Chinese people, under long-term feudal economic exploitation and political oppression, lived a poor and miserable slave-like life; in order to make the people obey their rule, the feudal rulers tried their best to cultivate the character of slaves in the people. Lu Xun repeatedly lamented that the Chinese people had never fought for the price of a "human being", at most they were only slaves, sometimes even worse than slaves. In Lu Xun's view, if the Chinese people could not get rid of this slave status, especially the status of being enslaved spiritually, the Chinese nation would not be able to survive in the modern world. Lu Xun's thorough spirit of opposing feudalism stemmed precisely from such a deep patriotic feeling. In his article "On the National Pride of the Great Russians," Lenin mentioned that Chernyshevsky said: "Poor nation, slave nation, slaves from top to bottom," Lenin believed that such words were the patriotic feelings revealed by Chernyshevsky because he lamented the lack of revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of the Great Russian people. Isn't Lenin's evaluation of the great Russian Enlightenment completely suitable for Lu Xun?
      The occurrence of the "May Fourth" anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement, as everyone knows, was the result of the development of Chinese national capitalism and the proletariat, and the result of the widespread intellectual youth being infected by advanced Western democratic and socialist ideas. The May Fourth Movement occurred precisely in such an era of world history: when the revolutionary nature of the Western bourgeoisie had declined, while the revolutionary nature of the proletarian socialism was on the rise. The Russian October Socialist Revolution awakened the national consciousness of the Chinese people and introduced Marxist-Leninist ideas into China. The reason why the "May Fourth" movement against feudal culture had such thoroughness and determination was precisely because it gained the power of encouragement from here.
    In the "May Fourth" new literary works, especially in Lu Xun's works, are filled with ardent patriotism, irreconcilable hatred for the feudal order and all old things that hindered China's progress, and deep concern for the interests of the people. In these works, there appeared new themes and characters of thorough anti-feudalism that had never existed in the history of Chinese literature.
    Peasants became the protagonists in the works. This is natural, as peasants are the largest revolutionary democrats and the main force in the anti-feudal struggle. In Chinese literary works throughout history, peasants have never had a position. It is true that "Water Margin" describes a large-scale peasant armed uprising in history, and the author portrayed the leaders of the peasant uprising with high sympathy, and concentrated the sharp point on the top layer and the most ferocious corrupt officials and tyrannical landlords of the feudal ruling class, but due to historical and class conditions, this uprising did not get rid of the primitive and patriarchal form, and the author did not fundamentally criticize and negate the entire feudal patriarchal system and ideology thoroughly. The era of the "May Fourth" was different. The authors proceeded from the standpoint of fundamentally negating the feudal system and observed and described the lives of ordinary peasants and their life's destiny from the perspective of revolutionary democrats. The peasants suffered from the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism. Their life position had no other way out except revolution. They urgently and strongly demanded revolution; but the old democratic revolution led by the Chinese bourgeoisie did not bring them liberation, and they themselves could not liberate themselves because they did not have an advanced class to lead them. They still lacked awareness and organization. This weakness was precisely the result of the feudal rulers' long-term persecution and enslavement of the peasants spiritually. The "May Fourth" authors, on the one hand, made a fierce attack on the entire superstructure of the feudal patriarchal system and ideology, and on the other hand, pointed out and painfully criticized the backwardness of the peasants.
    Lu Xun had a very deep understanding of the peasants and was most concerned about their destiny. As an Enlightenment thinker, he raised a serious question - how to enlighten the peasants' revolutionary spirit and raise the peasants' democratic awareness. He discovered the contradiction between the peasants' tragic life position of having to revolt and their subjective lack of democratic revolutionary awareness, and could not find a way out to solve this contradiction. He once described in an early article that the attitude of advanced thinkers and poets towards slaves was "sorrow for their misfortune and anger at their lack of struggle," which in his view meant on the one hand, feeling deeply saddened by the unfortunate situation of the peasants, and on the other hand, feeling extremely indignant at their lack of awareness and lack of struggle. This precisely reflects the mind of a truly revolutionary humanitarian and the characteristics of a revolutionary Enlightenment thinker.
    For thousands of years, peasants have been bound by layers of feudal economic exploitation and political oppression, patriarchal system and patriarchal ideology, superstitious concepts, and various conservative and backward customs in the countryside. Without getting rid of these shackles, peasants cannot thoroughly turn themselves over. And what Lu Xun, as an Enlightenment thinker, felt most painful was the spiritual enslavement of the peasants by the feudal rulers. It was precisely this enslavement that caused the peasants' spiritual numbness or the blindness and spontaneity of their actions. In his novels about peasants, especially the outstanding and famous "The True Story of Ah Q," he most profoundly and concentratedly criticized the negative, backward, and unaware aspects of the peasants. The Xinhai Revolution did not give the peasants real benefits, did not rely on the peasants, enlighten their awareness and initiative, and guide them on the road of revolution, which doomed the inevitable failure of the Xinhai Revolution. Here, Lu Xun's criticism of the weaknesses of the peasants is also a serious historical judgment of the Xinhai Revolution. Lu Xun also regarded the spiritual weakness of the peasants, who accounted for the majority of China's population, as a weakness of national character, and he demanded the reform of national character. Of course, these weaknesses cannot represent the true characteristics of our national character. When we talk about national character or national character, we must distinguish between which are the true national common spiritual state that represents the fundamental interests of the broad working people and reflects their hardworking and brave essence, and which are just prejudices and bad habits that proceed from the narrow group interests of the exploiting classes and are forcibly instilled into the consciousness of the working people by them. The peasants' lack of awareness and disunity are all caused by the feudal rulers. Lu Xun deeply understood this situation, and therefore he felt it most painfully.
    Lu Xun used all his strength to attack the feudal system and its representatives, calling on and educating the people to hate this system and these characters, and at the same time, the peasants in his pen, no matter how conservative, backward, and ignorant they are, their characters are so kind, hardworking, and upright! They should have the right to live a human life. Lu Xun thoroughly and powerfully exposed the darkness of old China, which even permeated the depths of the souls of the oppressed and exploited. Even so, Lu Xun did not express pessimism in the face of any dark forces. He was always a historical optimist. He consciously deleted darkness and added joy to his works, predicting that the people would surely live a new and reasonable life that had never existed before. Here, his realism and idealism have achieved a good combination. This is precisely an important spirit of the "May Fourth" realistic new literature. This spirit makes the "May Fourth" realistic new literature have much greater thoroughness and militancy than general critical realism and is closer to socialist realism.
    Lu Xun was uncompromising and irreconcilable towards the feudal old order, and he firmly believed in the happy future of the people; it was just that he had not found, and therefore could not clearly point out, the specific road for the people to achieve a happy life. At the time of the May Fourth Movement, the proletariat had not yet combined with the broad masses of peasants through its vanguard and led the peasants to carry out the democratic revolution; at that time, Lu Xun and many leading figures of the "May Fourth" had not yet realized that the proletariat was the only emerging social force that could bring liberation to the peasants. Lu Xun's confusion and distress for a time came from this. When he finally found the proletariat, the most thorough revolutionary democrat, he immediately combined his entire life with the fate of the proletariat.
    Only under the leadership of the Chinese working class and the Communist Party, after the Chinese people have been liberated and the rural democratic revolution has achieved victory, can the life and spiritual outlook of the peasants, and the fate of the peasants, undergo fundamental changes. They are no longer slaves, but have become the masters of the country. In the struggle to overthrow domestic and foreign reactionaries and in production and construction, they have highly developed their democratic revolutionary awareness and demonstrated socialist awareness. This great change in the countryside has been vividly reflected in the works of Ding Ling, Zhao Shuli, Zhou Libo, and some other new writers. Socialist realism literature is only possible when the author observes and describes the contradictions and struggles of social classes from the standpoint of the working class's ideology and the Party's policies, and truthfully expresses all the advanced and socialist factors that promote this struggle forward.
    When we are currently striving for national socialist construction and socialist transformation, an important task of literary and art workers is to create images of new rural figures who have completed the people's democratic revolution and are carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, to express their new lives, labor and struggles, their new thoughts and emotions, their democratic and socialist awareness constantly improving process, and help accelerate this process.
    The advanced writers of the "May Fourth" era left us a tragic picture of the lives of peasants in old China. They once lamented the peasants' lack of awareness and lack of struggle so painfully, and raised fiery protests against all kinds of oppressors and exploiters of the people. Now the Chinese people have used their own strength to destroy the cursed old China from its roots and are building a beautiful and happy new China. However, the influence of various bad ideas and bad habits left over from the old society still exists in the lives and consciousness of the people, and eradicating these influences requires a long-term, persistent, and tenacious struggle. We should inherit the fighting tradition of the "May Fourth", learn from the excellent legacy of the "May Fourth" our great pioneers' extremely profound dissection and denunciation of old China, and their tenacious fighting spirit against all outdated and backward things that hinder China's progress.
    Another new theme that appeared in the "May Fourth" new literary works is the description of the life and struggle of new-style intellectuals. This is also natural, because intellectuals are the first conscious elements in the democratic revolutionary movement. Chinese intellectuals felt the influence of advanced Western science and advanced cultural ideas, and felt particularly keenly the pain of national oppression and feudal oppression they suffered. They urgently demanded to get rid of the spiritual shackles imposed on them by the feudal patriarchal system and ideology, and they demanded the liberation of individuality. Striving for freedom of marriage became a common theme in the works, and Ibsenism became a temporary fashion. This demand for individual liberation undoubtedly had its positive and progressive significance in the anti-feudal struggle. Many writers of the "May Fourth" described the images of these new-style male and female intellectuals with democratic tendencies, who replaced the sons and daughters of aristocratic families and talented scholars and beautiful women in Chinese feudal old literature and became the masters of the era. Many of these intellectuals are thoughtful, talented, and have their own ambitions and ideals, and are often conscientious and upright people. But what was their fate in old China? They were extremely dissatisfied with and hostile to the old society; they had a strong spirit of resistance; but when they fought alone without uniting with the masses, their resistance was always doomed to failure. Lu Xun profoundly described the encounters and fate of such intellectuals in works such as "In the Tavern," "The Misanthrope," and "Regret for the Past." Intellectuals, no matter how enthusiastic their democratic ideals are, and no matter how strong and beautiful their character is, they cannot achieve anything if they do not combine with the broad masses, and their fate can only lead to tragic results. Individual liberation, if there is no national liberation and social liberation as a prerequisite, if the individual does not combine with the masses, then the so-called individual liberation is often just creating personal tragedies. The only correct way out for intellectuals is to combine with the broad masses and combine individual struggle with the people's struggle and the people's cause. At the time of the May Fourth Movement, the slogan "Go to the people" was put forward. Under the agitation of democratic and socialist ideas at that time, advanced intellectuals took off their gowns and truly ran to the masses, and these people later became the backbone and backbone of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The final division of revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their final division lies only in this point." This is the truth that has been completely confirmed by the entire history of intellectuals since the "May Fourth." In the "May Fourth" literary works, the idea of bourgeois individual liberation is often combined with the yearning for socialism. In the poems of Guo Moruo, the first most outstanding poet after the "May Fourth", who sang the praises of individuality, socialism was praised with the same high enthusiasm, as were the strength of the workers and peasants, and the great Lenin. Guo Moruo expressed a strong spirit of revolutionary romanticism in his works.
    Now the national oppression and feudal oppression that were pressing on the Chinese people and restricting the development of their individuality have been thoroughly overthrown, and the people's individuality has achieved the conditions for the most extensive and multifaceted development. An important task of our literary and art workers is to help the people cultivate and develop new individuality. The individuality we require should be an individuality that is connected with the people and integrated with the people, an individuality that is willing to contribute everything to the people's cause. This is a constructive individuality. We must oppose individuality that is divorced from the people and opposed to the people, and oppose the bourgeois despicable individualistic individuality, which is a destructive individuality and incompatible with the new society. Our literary and artistic works should take the active cultivation of the people's collectivist thought and overcoming individualism in people's consciousness as their task.
    The pioneers of the "May Fourth" left us a picture of the tragic encounters and fate of intellectuals in old China, describing how they were oppressed, ravaged, and buried by the unreasonable system of the old society, and how much exploration they experienced, how many detours they took, and how much pain they suffered when they were not united with the people. Now our country is emerging new intellectuals from the broad masses of the people, and the old intellectuals are also gradually acquiring new ideas and new styles and becoming the people's intellectuals through the methods of ideological transformation and practical training. From the "May Fourth" literary heritage, we can see the road that intellectuals have traveled, and learn from it experiences and lessons.
      The "May Fourth" Literary Revolution was a thorough anti-feudal ideological movement, and at the same time a great revolution in literary form. The representatives of the "May Fourth" opposed classical Chinese and advocated vernacular Chinese, gave a fatal blow to the feudal literature that had always reigned supreme and its expression form, the classical Chinese, and put the literary works that had always been rejected by the feudal rulers and were close or relatively close to the people's lives and the people's language in a legitimate position. At the same time, advanced democratic and socialist cultural ideas and various advanced literary and artistic forms were introduced from the West, thus making Chinese literature more innovative, richer, and more vivid from content to form. This is a great achievement of the "May Fourth" Literary Revolution.
      Although the "May Fourth" new literature was mainly limited to the circle of intellectuals at the beginning, it brought literature much closer to the broad masses of the people in any case. At that time, many articles were fresh, lively, and full of vitality. Especially Lu Xun's works, because they adopted the vivid spoken language of the people and processed it, reached a high degree of artistic conciseness, and should become a model for our literary creation.
      The "May Fourth" vernacular literature naturally still has great shortcomings, and it is not popular enough. Under the domination of the concept of blindly worshiping Western culture, some people mechanically moved Western literary and artistic forms, regardless of national traditions and the habits of the broad masses, and became "foreign dogmas," which greatly hindered the combination of new literature and art with the broad masses. An important task of our literary and art workers is to strictly follow the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, strive to make literature closer to the lives and language of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and gradually become their own literature. Literary and art workers must constantly transform and train themselves by actively participating in the practical struggle of the masses, strive to improve their artistic cultivation, and strengthen artistic practice, so that our achievements surpass those of our predecessors.
    We must critically and creatively inherit the legacy of the "May Fourth." We should first sort out and study Lu Xun's works, which are the most brilliant, most important, and most valuable part of the "May Fourth" legacy.
    Naturally, when we talk about inheriting the legacy of the "May Fourth," we must see that the development of Chinese new literature has gone through various external and internal contradictions and struggles, because the development of literature cannot be separated from the development of society and the history of class struggle. The realism represented by Lu Xun formed a mainstream of the new literature movement since the "May Fourth." It was developed and strengthened in the struggle against various reactionary thoughts on the cultural front - from feudal restorationists to reformists, and formalism, decadentism, and other anti-realist and anti-people tendencies in literature and art. Lu Xun himself also went through the development process from a revolutionary democrat to a communist. After the revolution from 1924 to 1927, with the deepening of the "rural revolution" and the "cultural revolution," a proletarian and left-wing literary movement emerged on the literary and art front; as Lu Xun correctly evaluated, this was the "only literary movement" in the dark China under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang at that time. Lu Xun became a great communist during this period and a great founder of socialist realism in his creative activities.
    We say that the new literature and art since the "May Fourth" has been developing towards socialist realism from the beginning, which refers to the trend of its entire development. We cannot adopt the method of finding place names on a map and simply judge which literary works are socialist realism and which are not based on individual words in the works. What we should look for in literary works is the author's faithfulness to life, the depth of the exposure of class contradictions, the strong hatred for dark forces, and the firm support for the interests of the people. These are the things that we must inherit and develop as excellent traditions from the "May Fourth" literary heritage.
    To inherit the "May Fourth" tradition is to further promote it and continue to complete the work that could not be completed under the historical conditions of the "May Fourth" at that time. Now, the task before us is a task that has never existed and could not exist in the past in literature and art. Our literary and art workers must express the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, which is unprecedented in Chinese history, and express the great struggle of the socialist and democratic camp against the reactionary group of imperialism. Literary and artistic works must express new workers, new peasants, and new intellectuals, criticize and denounce all old things and old ideas that hinder the people's progress, and guide the people to actively participate in the great struggle to build socialism and defend socialism. This is the most serious and glorious task that the people require of literary and art workers today.

    发扬“五四”文学革命的战斗传统
    周　扬
    五四运动是伟大的反帝国主义、反封建主义的革命运动，同时也是伟大的文化革新运动。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中对这个文化革新运动给予了极高的评价。他说：
    “五四运动所进行的文化革命则是澈底地反对封建文化的运动，自有中国历史以来，还没有过这样伟大而澈底的文化革命。当时以反对旧道德提倡新道德、反对旧文学提倡新文学，为文化革命的两大旗帜，立下了伟大的功劳。”
    而鲁迅，正如毛泽东同志所指出的，就是这个
  “文化革命的主将”，“最伟大和最英勇的旗手”。
    现在距离五四运动已经三十五年了。从“五四”开始的新民主主义革命已在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下取得了完全的胜利，我国人民正为把祖国建设成一个新的社会主义国家而进行着创造性的劳动和艰苦的斗争。从“五四”开始的人民文学艺术运动，正以空前广大的规模，沿着为工农兵群众服务的方向和社会主义现实主义的创作原则而向前发展着。
      “五四”文学革命提出了文艺上的现实主义的原则，提出了文艺为人民和社会的利益服务的原则，创造了以接近群众的语言描写人民的现实生活和斗争，反映人民的民主革命要求的文艺作品，这是中国文学历史上从来没有过的完全新的现象。“五四”文学革命，不管它在理论上和创作实践上还有些什么缺点和限制，是中国文学史上的第一次真正伟大的革命。可以毫不夸张地说，没有这个文学革命，也就没有我们今天的人民文学艺术运动。
    一九四二年毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”及其在文艺上所引起的变革，是“五四”文学革命在新的历史条件下的继续和发展。毛泽东同志根据马克思、列宁主义的理论，概括地、批判地总结了“五四”以来新文学运动的历史经验，促使我们的文学艺术运动进入了一个新的阶段。
    整理和研究“五四”文学遗产，继承并发扬其中一切优秀的、正确的传统，是我们文学艺术工作中的一项重要的任务。
    “五四”文学革命所遗留给我们的好的传统究竟有些什么东西呢？
    这个文学革命，作为反帝反封建革命斗争的一种形式，它的力量首先就在它的反对封建文化的澈底性和坚决性。中国新文学的第一篇作品，鲁迅的“狂人日记”，就是一篇对封建主义充满正气和勇敢的宣战书。它像烈火一样地烧毁了封建宗法的思想和制度的全部假面，无情地揭露了几千年来封建礼教的吃人的本质，它发出警告：“将来容不得吃人的人，活在世上”，号召人们过“真的人”的生活。
    中国人民，在长期封建的经济剥削和政治压迫之下过着贫穷困苦的奴隶式的生活；封建统治者为了使人民顺从他们的统治，极力把人民培养成奴隶的性格。鲁迅再三地慨叹着中国人民从来没有争到过“人”的价格，至多不过做奴隶，有时连奴隶还不如。在鲁迅看来，中国人民如果不能摆脱这种奴隶地位，特别是摆脱在精神上被奴役的地位，中国民族也就不能在现代世界上生存。鲁迅的澈底的反对封建的精神，正是从这样一种深沉的爱国心情出发的。列宁在“论大俄罗斯人底民族自傲心”一文中曾提到车尔尼雪夫斯基说过：“可怜的民族，奴隶的民族，上上下下都是些奴隶”，这样的话，列宁认为是由于车尔尼雪夫斯基感慨大俄罗斯人民群众缺少革命性而吐露的爱国心情。列宁对于俄国伟大启蒙主义者的这个评价，不是完完全全适合于鲁迅吗？
      “五四”反帝反封建运动的发生，如大家所知道的，是中国民族资本主义和无产阶级发展的结果，是当时广大知识分子青年感染了西方先进的民主主义和社会主义思想的结果。五四运动正是发生在这样一个世界历史的时代：在西方资产阶级的民主主义的革命性已经衰亡，而无产阶级社会主义的革命性正方兴未艾。俄国十月社会主义革命唤起了中国人民的民族觉醒，向中国传进了马克思、列宁主义的思潮。“五四”反对封建文化的运动所以具有那样的澈底性和坚决性，就正是从这里得到了鼓舞的力量的。
    在“五四”新文学作品，特别是鲁迅的作品中，充满了热烈的爱国主义、对于封建秩序及一切阻碍中国进步的旧事物的不可调和的仇恨和对人民利益的深切关怀。在这些作品中，出现了中国文学史上从未有过的澈底反封建的新的主题和人物。
    农民成了作品中的主人公。这是自然的，农民是最大的革命民主派，是反封建斗争的主力。在中国历来的文学作品中，农民是从来没有地位的。不错，“水浒”描写了历史上一次规模宏大的农民武装起义，作者以高度的同情刻划了农民起义的领袖人物，而把锋芒集中在封建统治阶级中最上层和最凶恶的大贪官污吏和恶霸地主，但由于历史的和阶级的条件所限制，这个起义并没有脱出原始的、宗法的形态，而作者也没有对整个封建宗法的制度和思想从根本上给予澈底的批判和否定。“五四”的时代就不同了，作者们是从根本否定封建制度的立场出发，以革命的民主主义者的观点来观察和描写普通农民的生活和他们一生的命运。农民受尽了帝国主义和封建主义的双重压迫，他们的生活地位除了革命再没有别的出路，他们迫切地、强烈地要求革命；但是中国资产阶级所领导的旧民主主义革命却没有给他们带来解放，而他们自己又由于没有一个先进阶级来领导他们而不能够自己解放自己，他们还缺乏觉悟性和组织性，这种弱点正是封建统治者从精神上对于农民长期施行迫害和奴役的结果。“五四”的作者们一方面对封建宗法制度和思想的整个上层建筑作了猛烈的抨击，另一方面也指出了并沉痛地批判了农民的落后性。
    鲁迅对于农民是有极深刻的理解的，对于他们的命运是最关心的。他作为一个启蒙主义者，提出了一个严重的问题——如何启发农民的革命性，提高农民的民主主义的觉悟。他发现了农民不能不革命的悲惨的生活地位和他们在主观上还缺乏民主主义的革命觉悟性两者之间的矛盾，找不出解决这个矛盾的出路。他曾在他早期所写的一篇文章中述说了先进的思想家、诗人对于奴隶们的态度是“哀其不幸，怒其不争”，在他说来就是一方面对农民的不幸的境遇感到深切的沉痛，而另一方面对他们的缺乏觉悟和缺乏斗争性则又感到极大的愤懑，这正表现了一个真正革命人道主义者的胸怀和革命启蒙主义者的特色。
    几千年来，农民被封建的经济剥削和政治压迫、宗法制度和宗法思想、迷信观念以及农村的各种保守落后习惯所层层束缚，不解脱这些束缚，农民是不能够澈底翻身的。而作为启蒙主义者的鲁迅所最感痛心的是封建统治者对农民的精神上的奴役，正是这种奴役造成了农民的精神麻木状态或行动起来时的盲目性和自发性。他在他的关于农民的小说，特别是杰出的、著名的“阿Q正传”中，最深刻地、集中地批判了农民的消极的、落后的、不觉悟的方面。辛亥革命没有给农民以真正的利益，没有依靠农民，启发他们的觉悟性和积极性，引导他们走上革命的道路，这就注定了辛亥革命的必然失败。在这里，鲁迅对于农民的弱点方面的批评，同时也正是对于辛亥革命的一个严正的历史的评判。鲁迅把占我国人口最大多数的农民的精神上的弱点也是当作国民性的弱点来批判的，他要求国民性的改革。当然这些弱点是不能代表我们民族性格的真正的特点的。当我们讲到国民性或民族性格的时候，我们不能不区别哪些是代表广大劳动人民的根本利益，反映他们勤劳、勇敢的本质的真正民族共同的精神状态，哪些不过是从剥削阶级的狭小集团利益出发，由他们所强迫灌输到劳动人民意识中去的偏见和恶习。农民的不觉悟，不团结，都是封建统治者所造成的。这种情形是鲁迅所深切了解的，因而也就是他所最感痛心的。
    鲁迅以全部的力量抨击了封建制度及其代表人物，号召和教育人民去仇恨这种制度和这些人物，同时在他笔下的农民，不管他们是如何保守、落后、愚昧，但他们的性格却是多么善良、勤劳、正直啊！他们应当有权利过人的生活。鲁迅澈底地有力地揭露了旧中国的黑暗，这种黑暗甚至浸透到了被压迫被剥削者的灵魂深处，虽然如此，鲁迅并没有在任何黑暗势力面前表示悲观，他始终是一个历史的乐观主义者。他有意识地在他的作品中删削黑暗，增添欢容，预示人民一定会过到一种从来没有的新的合理的生活。在这里，他的现实主义和理想主义取得了很好的结合。这正是“五四”现实主义新文艺的一个重要精神，这个精神使“五四”现实主义新文艺具有了比一般批判的现实主义更大得多的澈底性和斗争性而和社会主义现实主义更相接近。
    鲁迅对于封建旧秩序是决不妥协，决不调和的，对人民的幸福前途是坚信不疑的；只是他还没有找到，因而也就不能明确指出人民达到幸福生活的具体的道路。在五四运动的当时，无产阶级还没有通过自己的先锋队和广大农民相结合，领导农民进行民主革命；那时候，鲁迅以及“五四”的不少领导人物都还没有认识无产阶级是唯一能够给农民带来解放的新兴的社会力量。鲁迅的一个时候的彷徨苦闷就是由此而来的。当他终于找到了无产阶级这个最澈底的革命民主派的时候，他就立刻把自己的整个生命和无产阶级的命运结合为一了。
    只有在中国工人阶级和共产党的领导之下，中国人民获得解放，农村民主革命取得胜利之后，农民的生活和精神面貌，农民的命运，才有了根本的改变。他们已不再是奴隶，而成为国家的主人了。他们在推翻国内外反动派的斗争中，在生产建设中，高度地发挥了他们的民主主义的革命觉悟性，并且表现了社会主义的觉悟。这个农村的大变化，在丁玲、赵树理、周立波以及其他一些新的作家的作品中得到了鲜明的反映。社会主义现实主义的文学是只有作者站在工人阶级的思想和党的政策的立场来观察和描写社会阶级的矛盾和斗争，并真实地表现了推动这个斗争前进的一切先进的和社会主义的因素的时候，才有可能。
    当我们目前正在争取国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时候，文艺工作者的一个重要任务，就是创造完成了人民民主革命，正在对农业实行社会主义改造的农村新人物的形象，表现他们的新的生活、劳动和斗争，他们的新的思想和情感，他们的民主主义和社会主义的觉悟不断提高的过程，并帮助加速这个过程。
    “五四”时代的先进的作家们为我们留下了旧中国农民生活的悲惨的图画，他们是曾经那样痛苦地感慨着农民的不觉悟和缺乏斗争性，而对于人民的各式各样压迫者、剥削者提出了火焰似的抗议。现在中国人民已经用自己的力量把那可诅咒的旧中国连根破坏了，而正在建设着一个美好的、幸福的新中国。但是旧社会所残留的各种坏思想、坏习惯的影响还在人民的生活和意识中存在着，肃清这些影响需要有一个长期的、持久的、坚韧的斗争。我们应当继承“五四”的战斗传统，从“五四”的优秀遗产中，学习我们的伟大的先驱者们对于旧中国的极其深刻的解剖和鞭挞以及他们对于阻碍中国进步的一切陈旧的、落后的事物的顽强战斗的精神。
   在“五四”新文学作品中出现的另一个新的主题是描写新式知识分子的生活和斗争。这也是自然的，因为知识分子在民主革命运动中是首先觉悟的成分。中国知识分子感受了西方先进的科学和先进的文化思想的影响，对自己所身受的民族压迫和封建压迫的痛苦，感觉特别敏锐，他们迫切地要求解脱封建宗法的制度和思想所加于他们的精神束缚，他们要求个性的解放。争取婚姻自由成了作品中常见的主题，易卜生主义成为了一时的风尚。这个个性解放的要求，在反封建的斗争中无疑地是具有它的积极的、进步的意义的。“五四”许多作家的作品中，都描写了这种具有民主倾向的新式的男女知识分子的形象，他们就代替了中国历来封建旧文学中公子小姐、才子佳人的地位而成为时代的主人。这些知识分子很多是有思想、有才能、有自己的抱负和理想的，并且也常常是有良心的、正直的人。但是在旧中国，他们的命运如何呢？他们对旧社会极端不满和仇视；他们具有强烈的反抗精神；但当他们没有和群众结合而只是孤军奋斗的时候，他们的反抗总是要失败的。鲁迅在“在酒楼上”“孤独者”“伤逝”等作品中就深刻地描写了这类知识分子的遭遇和命运。知识分子，不管他们具有多么热忱的民主主义的理想，也不管他们的性格是多么坚强、优美，在他们没有与广大群众结合的时候，他们是不能有所作为的，他们的命运只能落到悲惨的结果。个性解放，如果没有民族解放和社会解放作前提，个人如果不与群众相结合，那末，所谓个性解放，往往不过是造成个人悲剧而已。知识分子的唯一正确的出路，就是和广大群众结合，把个人的奋斗和人民的斗争、人民的事业相结合。五四运动的时候提出了“到民间去”的口号。当时先进的知识分子在民主主义和社会主义思想的激荡之下，脱下了长衫，真正跑到了群众当中去，这些人后来就成为了中国人民革命运动的中坚力量和骨干力量。毛泽东同志说过：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点”。这就是被“五四”以来知识分子的全部历史所完全证实了的真理。在“五四”文学作品中，资产阶级式的个性解放的思想，往往和对社会主义的向往结合在一起。在“五四”以后第一个最卓越的诗人郭沫若的个性歌颂的诗歌中，以同样的高度热情歌颂了社会主义，歌颂了工人农民的力量，歌颂了伟大的列宁。郭沫若在他的作品中表现了强烈的革命浪漫主义的精神。
    现在压在中国人民身上，束缚他们个性发展的民族压迫和封建压迫已被澈底推翻了，人民的个性取得了最广大的多方面发展的条件。我们文艺工作者的一个重要任务，就是帮助人民培养和发展新的个性。我们所要求的个性应当是与人民联系的、和人民打成一片的个性，是愿意把自己的一切贡献给人民的事业的个性，这才是建设性的个性。我们必须反对和人民脱离的、同人民对立的个性，反对资产阶级的卑鄙的个人主义的个性，那是破坏性的个性，和新社会不相容的。我们的文艺作品应当以积极培养人民集体主义思想，克服人们意识中的个人主义作为自己的任务。
    “五四”的先驱者们为我们留下了旧中国知识分子的悲惨的遭遇和命运的图画，描写了他们如何被旧社会的不合理制度所压迫、摧残和埋没，在他们没有和人民结合的时候曾经经历了多少的摸索，走了多少的弯路，受尽了多少的痛苦。现在我们的国家正从广大人民中涌现出新的知识分子，旧的知识分子经过思想改造和实际锻炼的方法，也逐渐取得了新思想和新作风，变为人民的知识分子了。从
  “五四”的文学遗产中，我们可以看到知识分子所走过来的道路，从中吸取经验和教训。
      “五四”文学革命，是澈底的反封建思想的运动，同时又是文学形式上的大革命。“五四”的代表人物反对文言，提倡白话，对从来君临一切的封建文学及其表现形式的文言给与了一个致命的打击，而把中国历来被封建统治者所排斥的、接近或比较接近人民生活和人民语言的文学作品放到了正宗的地位，同时从西方介绍了先进的民主主义和社会主义的文化思想以及各种先进的文艺形式，这样，就使中国的文学从内容到形式都获得了革新而更丰富、更生动了，这是“五四”文学革命的很大的功绩。
      “五四”新文学，虽然在开始的时候主要还是局限在知识分子的圈子，没有普及到工农群众中去，但无论如何使文学和广大人民大大接近了一步。当时很多的文章是新鲜的、活泼的、充满生气的。特别是鲁迅的作品，由于采用了人民群众的生动的口语并且进行了加工，达到了艺术上高度的简练，应该成为我们文学创作的范本。
      “五四”的白话文学自然还是有很大缺点的，它还不够大众化。一部分人在盲目崇拜西方文化的观念支配之下，不顾民族传统和广大群众习惯，机械地搬运西方文学艺术形式，成为“洋教条”，曾大大地妨碍了新文艺和广大群众的结合。我们文艺工作者的一个重要任务，就是严格遵从文艺为工农兵服务的方向，努力使文学更加接近广大工农群众的生活和语言，并逐步成为他们自己的文学。文艺工作者必须在积极参加群众的实际斗争的生活当中，不断地改造和锻炼自己，努力提高艺术修养，加强艺术实践，使我们的成就超过前人。
    我们必须批判地、创造性地继承“五四”的遗产。我们应当首先整理和研究鲁迅的著作，它们是
  “五四”遗产中最光辉、最重要、最有价值的部分。
    自然，当我们说到继承“五四”遗产的时候，我们必须看到中国新文学的发展是经过了外部和内部的各种矛盾和斗争的，因为文学的发展决不能脱离社会的发展，脱离阶级斗争的历史。以鲁迅为代表的现实主义形成了“五四”以来新文学运动的一道主流，它是在和文化战线上的各种反动思想——从封建复古派到改良主义派的思想，和文学艺术上的形式主义、颓废主义以及其他各色各样反现实主义、反人民的倾向作斗争的当中发展壮大起来的，而鲁迅自己也经历了从革命民主主义者到共产主义者的发展过程。自一九二四年至一九二七年的革命以后，随着“农村革命”和“文化革命”的深入，在文艺战线上出现了无产阶级的、左翼的文学运动；正如鲁迅所正确评价的，这是当时国民党反动统治下的黑暗中国的“唯一的文学运动”。鲁迅就在这个时期成为了伟大的共产主义者，在他的创造活动中成为了社会主义现实主义的伟大奠基人。
    我们说“五四”以来的新文艺从一开始就是向着社会主义现实主义发展的，这是指它的整个发展的趋向而言。我们不能采取从地图上找地名的办法，简单地根据作品中的个别字眼来判定哪一篇文学作品是社会主义现实主义的，哪一篇不是。我们在文学作品中所应当看取的，是作者对于生活的忠实，对于阶级矛盾的揭露的深刻，对于黑暗势力的强烈的仇恨和对于人民利益的坚决的拥护，这些就是我们从“五四”文学遗产中所必须当作优秀传统来加以继承和发展的东西。
    继承“五四”传统，就是要进一步发扬光大它，继续完成在“五四”当时的历史条件下所不能完成的工作。现在，摆在我们面前的任务，是过去文艺上所没有过而且不可能有的任务。我们的文艺工作者必须表现中国历史上空前未有的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业，表现社会主义和民主主义阵营反对帝国主义反动集团的巨大斗争。文艺作品必须表现新的工人、新的农民、新的知识分子，批判和鞭挞一切阻碍人民前进的旧事物旧思想，引导人民积极参与建设社会主义和保卫社会主义的伟大斗争。这就是今天人民所要求于文艺工作者的最严重也最光荣的任务。
