    Ningxia Province has completed the spring repair project of over 17,000 branch and ditch canals in the irrigated areas of the province, thanks to the active efforts of male and female laborers across the province. The successful completion of this spring repair project ensures irrigation for over 2.4 million mu of irrigated land in the province, creating favorable conditions for fulfilling this year's production increase tasks.
    The enthusiasm of male and female farmers in various localities for digging canals is very high. In a township in the fourth district of Lingwu, more than 90 women, in seven days, not only completed the planned seven branch canals but also dug a new branch canal one and a half li long. In Jinji Liao Jiaqiao Township, 192 male and female laborers completed the task of digging 64 large and small branch canals throughout the township in three days, ahead of the original five-day plan. In Yangqu Bridge Township, the 31 large and small branch canals were originally planned to be completed in four days, but due to the increased enthusiasm of everyone and the leadership of Communist Party members, the task was completed in just two days. For example, female Communist Party member Wang Fengying took the lead in jumping into the water to dig when water was reached in the canal, which motivated other women and ensured the early completion of the canal digging task. Various localities have emphasized improving quality during the canal digging process, and most women's canal digging teams are equipped with experienced veteran farmers to provide technical guidance. Women in various townships in the third district of Lingwu and in a township in the fourth district of Lingwu were equipped with two or three experienced veteran farmers in each team to specifically responsible for repairing the canals, thus ensuring that the projects met the standards completely.

    宁夏省修完支斗渠道一万七千多条
    宁夏省水地地区一万七千多条支、斗渠道的春修工程，在全省男女民工的积极努力下，已全部完工。这个春修工程的胜利完成，保证了全省二百四十多万亩水地的田间输水，给今年完成增产任务创造了有利条件。
    各地男女农民挖渠的劳动热情很高，灵武四区一乡九十多名妇女，七天时间内，除把原计划的七道支渠挖完外，又新挖了一里半长的一道新支渠。金积廖家桥乡男女民工一百九十二人，原计划五天挖完全乡的六十四道大小支渠，结果三天就完成了任务；杨渠桥乡的三十一道大小支渠，原计划四天挖完，但因为大家积极性的提高和共产党员的带头，只用了两天时间就全部挖完了。如女共产党员王凤英，当渠里挖到水的时候，她自己就带头跳到水里去挖，结果带动其他妇女，保证了挖渠任务的提前完成。各地在挖渠当中，都重视了提高质量，大部分妇女挖渠队里边，都预先配备了有经验的老农作技术指导。灵武三区各乡和四区一乡的妇女在挖渠时，每个小组配备了有经验的老农两三人，专门负责整理渠道，这样就保证了所做的工程完全合乎标准。
