Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 8th: Phạm Văn Đồng, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Geneva Conference and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, delivered a statement and motion on inviting representatives of the Cambodian and Laotian Resistance Governments to participate in the conference at the first meeting of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina on the afternoon of the 8th. The full text is as follows:

The task of our conference is to examine the issues of ceasing hostilities and restoring peace in Indochina.

This task is extremely important. It concerns the fate of the people of Indochina and the peace and security of the people of Southeast Asia and Asia, and it concerns world peace.

The people of Indochina are looking forward to the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and are prepared to realize their national rights through consultation. The French people and almost all French politicians demand the restoration of peace in Indochina. The people of Indochina and the French people hope to establish friendly relations between France and the countries of Indochina.

The people of Southeast Asia and Asia hope that the war in Indochina will stop and peace will be restored because the Indochina war is a threat to the peace and security of Southeast Asia and Asia. At present, this threat has become more serious and urgent due to attempts to prolong and expand the Indochina war. Therefore, the people of Southeast Asia and Asia more firmly demand the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

People all over the world hope to end the Indochina war and restore peace in order to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace. With the approval and support of people all over the world, our conference has favorable conditions to achieve satisfactory solutions on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina.

Everything that can help us accomplish this task is welcome and should not be rejected under any pretext.

It is in this spirit that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, reflecting the wishes of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, specifically proposes to the conference to invite official representatives of the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government to participate in the work of this conference.

Our reasons for making this proposal are as follows: The issue of ceasing hostilities and restoring peace in Indochina concerns the interests of the people of Indochina—the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. For many years, the people of Cambodia and Laos have been closely united with the people of Vietnam, carrying out a heroic struggle for peace, independence, unification, and democracy.

In this struggle, the people of Cambodia and Laos formed the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government. Under the leadership of these two resistance governments, the people of Cambodia and Laos have liberated vast territories. These two governments have done everything possible to establish a democratic government and improve the living standards of the people in the liberated areas.

Therefore, the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government have received the enthusiastic support and love of the people in the liberated areas and enjoy high prestige and great influence among all the people in the two countries. These two governments represent the majority of the people of Cambodia and Laos, and they embody the national aspirations of the people of the two countries. Therefore, it is necessary for official representatives of these two governments to participate in this conference, which aims to resolve the issue of ceasing hostilities and restoring peace in Indochina.

Like the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people and resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos are willing to use consultation to stop the Indochina war and restore peace in Indochina, while achieving their national rights, independence, unification, and democracy.

In the second half of March this year, the Foreign Ministers of the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government already declared their agreement with the Berlin Conference's resolution on convening the Geneva Conference.

For the above reasons, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly believes that the participation of official representatives of the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government in the conference, and their presentation to the conference of the wishes and suggestions of the people they represent, will not only not be an obstacle, but will instead be a guarantee of the success of our conference.

This is not only the wish of the people of the countries of Indochina, but also the wish of the people all over the world, and also the wish of all peace-loving people. They truly demand a solution to the issue of stopping the Indochina war and restoring peace in Indochina.

Therefore, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proposes to the conference to adopt the following resolution:

"In view of the current situation in the countries of Indochina, and in order to conduct a broad and objective discussion on the issue of ceasing hostilities and restoring peace in Indochina, the conference considers it necessary to invite representatives of the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government to participate in this conference on the issue of ceasing hostilities and restoring peace in these two countries."

    范文同关于邀请高棉和寮国抗战政府代表参加会议的声明和动议
    【新华社日内瓦八日电】参加日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团首席代表、代理外交部部长范文同，在八日下午举行的日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的第一次会议上，发表了关于邀请高棉和寮国政府代表参加会议的声明和动议。全文如下：
    我们会议的任务是审查关于停止在印度支那的敌对行动和恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    这个任务是极端重要的。它关系着印度支那人民的命运和东南亚及亚洲人民的和平和安全，并且关系着世界和平。
    印度支那各国人民盼望停止在印度支那的敌对行动，恢复印度支那的和平，并准备用协商方式实现他们的民族权利。法国人民和几乎所有的法国政界人士都要求恢复印度支那的和平。印度支那各国人民和法国人民都希望建立法国和印度支那各国之间的友好关系。
    东南亚和亚洲的各国人民希望在印度支那停止战争，恢复和平。因为印度支那战争对于东南亚和亚洲的和平和安全是一种威胁。目前，由于有人企图延长并扩大印度支那战争，这种威胁就更加严重和紧迫。因此，东南亚及亚洲人民更坚决地要求在印度支那停止敌对行动，恢复和平。
    全世界人民希望结束印度支那战争并恢复和平，以便缓和国际紧张局势，巩固世界和平。在全世界人民的赞同和支持之下，我们的会议具有有利的条件，在恢复印度支那和平的问题上获得满意的解决。
    一切能够帮助我们完成这个任务的，都值得欢迎，而不应该在任何借口之下受到排斥。
    就是在这种精神之下，越南民主共和国代表团反映着越南、高棉、寮国三国人民的意愿，特向会议建议，邀请高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府的正式代表参加这次会议的工作。
    我们提出这项建议的理由如下：在印度支那停止敌对行动和恢复和平的问题，关系着印度支那各国人民——越南人民及高棉和寮国人民的利益。多年以来，高棉和寮国人民紧密地同越南人民团结一起，为争取和平、独立、统一和民主而进行着英勇的斗争。
    在这一斗争中，高棉和寮国人民组成了高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府。在这两个抗战政府的领导之下，高棉和寮国人民解放了广大的国土。这两个政府尽了一切力量来建立民主政权，改善解放区人民的生活水平。
    因此，高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府得到解放区人民热烈的支持和爱戴，并在两国全体人民中享有很高的威信和巨大的影响。这两个政府代表着大部分的高棉和寮国人民，它们体现着两国人民的民族愿望。因此，这两个政府的正式代表参加这次旨在解决在印度支那停止敌对行动和恢复和平问题的会议是必要的。
    正如越南民主共和国人民和政府一样，高棉和寮国的人民和抗战政府愿意用协商的方式来停止印度支那战争并恢复印度支那的和平，同时达到它们的民族权利、独立、统一和民主。
    在今年三月的下半月，高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府的外交部长已经声明他们同意关于召开日内瓦会议的柏林会议的决议。
    由于上述理由，越南民主共和国代表团坚信，高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府的正式代表参加会议，向会议提出他们所代表的人民的愿望和建议，这不仅不是一种障碍，相反，还将是使我们会议获得成就的一个保证。
    这不仅是印度支那各国人民的愿望，而且是全世界人民的愿望，同时也是所有爱好和平的人民的愿望。他们真正要求解决停止印度支那战争和恢复印度支那和平问题。
    因此，越南民主共和国代表团向会议建议通过如下决议：
   “鉴于印度支那各国的目前情况，并为了能够广泛地和客观地讨论在印度支那停止敌对行动和恢复和平的问题，会议认为有必要邀请高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府的代表参加这次关于在这两国境内停止敌对行动和恢复和平问题的会议。”
