    Xinhua News Agency, May 4th: TASS Moscow dispatches: "Pravda" special correspondents Zhukov, Prischevsky, and Lasagin sent a report from Geneva on the 4th, entitled "The Isolation of Advocates of the 'Position of Strength' Policy."

    The correspondents said that despite all the intrigues of the enemies of peace, an agreement was finally reached on the issue of the composition of the conference to discuss the Indochina problem. The correspondents also pointed out that U.S. Under Secretary of State Bedell Smith had flown from Washington to Geneva to replace Dulles, who had hastily flown back to the United States.

    The correspondents wrote: Observers in Geneva immediately saw a direct connection between these two events. They believe that the agreement on the issue of the composition of the conference to discuss the Indochina problem and Dulles' return home (many even call it "fleeing the meeting") signify a new failure of the U.S. "position of strength" policy. Newspapers also give the same assessment to these two events.

    After quoting comments from some Swiss and American newspapers, the correspondents continued: In the lounges of the Geneva Conference, it is generally believed that these two events are a dividing point, marking the end of a certain stage of diplomatic activity that began long before the Geneva Conference.

    Newspapers in London and Paris say that the U.S. delegation finds itself isolated in Geneva.

    The correspondents pointed out that the U.S. "position of strength" foreign policy, if not forced to cease operations, can at least be said to be forced to restrain itself.

    The correspondents continued, observers paying attention to the progress of the Geneva Conference are now predicting the prospects for negotiations on the Indochina issue. It is expected that negotiations will begin soon if the U.S. delegation does not take new obstructionist actions.

    It is believed here that the very fact that a decision has been reached on the procedural issues for discussing the Indochina problem at the Geneva Conference is a positive victory for the forces advocating a peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues. However, it must be remembered that there are still many difficulties ahead, because those who oppose a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue will never lay down their arms simply because they have suffered these setbacks.

    The "Pravda" correspondents pointed out that it would be wrong to ignore the fact that U.S. journalists in Geneva associate Dulles' hasty departure from the meeting with some kind of trick by U.S. policymakers. It has been repeatedly pointed out here that before leaving Geneva, Dulles issued strict orders to certain participants who depend on the United States, instructing them to insist on a proposal that would make a ceasefire in Indochina impossible in advance.

    The correspondents continued, one cannot ignore the report by "France-Soir"'s Washington observer, Patina, on May 3rd. Patina said that among the "prominent leaders" he visited, many believe that the sentiment advocating the expansion of the Indochina war "may become more dominant."

    The correspondents concluded that, therefore, the advocates of the "position of strength" policy have not abandoned their aggressive conspiracies in the slightest. They are only temporarily restraining themselves, waiting for a more appropriate opportunity to re-implement their conspiracies. All of this shows that at the Geneva Conference, there will still be a persistent and arduous struggle for the cause of peace and the security of all nations. The world's public must vigilantly monitor the progress of the negotiations. The joint efforts of all people who deeply care about easing international tensions and strengthening peace can and must guarantee the success of the negotiations.

    “实力地位”政策的拥护者的孤立
    ——“真理报”记者评杜勒斯回美国
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”特派记者茹科夫、普利歇夫斯基和拉萨金四日自日内瓦发出一篇报道，题为“‘实力地位’政策的拥护者的孤立”。
    记者说，尽管和平的敌人用尽了一切阴谋诡计，在关于讨论印度支那问题的会议的成员问题上，最后还是达成了协议。记者并指出，美国副国务卿贝德尔·史密斯已自华盛顿乘飞机到日内瓦，接替匆忙飞回美国的杜勒斯。
    记者写道：日内瓦的观察家们立即看出这两件事情有直接连带关系。他们认为，在关于讨论印度支那问题的会议的成员问题上达成协议和杜勒斯的回国（许多人甚至把它称为“逃会”），这两件事意味着美国“实力地位”政策的新的失败。报纸对这两件事情也给予同样的估计。
    记者在引了瑞士和美国的一些报纸的评论之后，接着写道：在日内瓦会议休息室里，人们都认为，这两件事是一个分界点，它标志着在日内瓦会议以前很久就开始的外交活动的一定阶段的结束。
    伦敦和巴黎的报纸说，美国代表团发现自己在日内瓦已陷于孤立。
    记者指出，美国的“实力地位”外交政策如果不能说是已被迫偃旗息鼓的话，无论如何也可以说是被迫收敛一下了。
    记者继续说，注意日内瓦会议进展的观察家现在正在预测关于印度支那问题的谈判的前途。预料如果美国代表团不采取新的阻挠行动，谈判不久就要开始了。
    这里认为，就日内瓦会议上讨论印度支那问题的程序问题取得一致同意的决定这一事实本身，就是主张和平解决悬而未决的国际问题的势力的一个肯定的胜利。然而必须记住，前面还有许多困难，因为反对和平解决印度支那问题的人们绝不会因为遭到这些失败就放下他们的武器。
    “真理报”记者指出，美国驻日内瓦的记者们把杜勒斯匆匆离开会议一事和美国决策者的某种诡计联系在一起，如果忽视这一点，那是错误的。这里一再指出，杜勒斯在离开日内瓦以前，就对某些依赖美国的与会者下了严厉的命令，要他们坚持一种能够事先就使印度支那的停战不可能实现的建议。
    记者接着说，人们不能忽视“法兰西晚报”驻华盛顿观察员帕蒂纳五月三日的报道。帕蒂纳说，在他访问过的“著名的领袖”中，有许多人都认为，主张扩大印度支那战争的情绪“可能要更加得势”。
    记者最后说，因此，“实力地位”政策的鼓吹者丝毫没有放弃他们的侵略阴谋的意思。他们只是暂时收敛一下，等候一个更恰当的机会来重新实行他们的阴谋。这一切都表明，在日内瓦会议上，还要为和平和各国人民的安全的事业进行坚持不渝的、艰苦的斗争。全世界的公众必须警惕地注视谈判的进行。一切深切关怀缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平的人民的共同努力，可以而且一定能够保证谈判的成功。
