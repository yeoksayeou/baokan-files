The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 17, 1954, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Defending Peace is the Vital Cause of All Peoples," commemorating the fifth anniversary of the First World Peace Congress. The editorial points out: Over the past five years, the world peace movement has expanded and consolidated its mass base, been supplemented by new forces, and become a truly invincible movement of our time. Today, even the most ferocious enemies of the cause of peace cannot but acknowledge the achievements of the world peace movement and cannot but be apprehensive. The struggle of the people of all countries to safeguard and consolidate peace has led to initial signs of relaxation in international tensions. The people of all countries are increasingly convinced that consultation can lead to the solution of the most complex international problems. The editorial continues: The Soviet Union's proposal to establish collective security for all European countries and to conclude an all-European treaty on collective security is receiving increasing active support from the broad masses. In Asia, not only the broad masses of the Asian people but also many Asian politicians resolutely oppose the United States' policy of aggression. The conspiracies of the enemies of peace in Asia, the Far East, and other parts of the world have been struck by the powerful peace movement. The peace movement is capable of thwarting the anti-people conspiracies of the American imperialists and their accomplices.

This issue contains important articles: "Strive for the Great Unity of All National Forces in Italy" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "The Fighting Program of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany" by Fred Oelssner, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; and "The Rural Work of the Hungarian Working Youth League" by János Gosztonyi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working Youth League.

Togliatti's article first summarizes the current basic international situation. He points out: The United States' atomic threats and intimidation policies threaten the vast masses of people throughout the world. Therefore, this makes it possible to launch a movement to unite forces that are completely different from each other in essence, social nature, and political nature, to launch a movement to truly defend human civilization and save humanity. Togliatti continues: In Italy, the socialist movement has united the vast majority of the working class and most of the other working masses, the middle class, and the peasantry. On the other hand, there is also the world of Catholic masses and their organizations and institutions. Apart from the upper leadership of the Catholic Church, a large part of the Catholic middle class and the broad masses of Catholics have long stood on our side, and those Catholics who do not stand with us or even oppose us already have the same demands as the masses we lead. Therefore, there is a great possibility to achieve mutual understanding, close relationships, and reach agreements. This is the path we must take. Therefore, we must have new policies and new decisions.

Oelssner's article states: After the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was recently held in Berlin, the struggle of the German working people and all German patriots to restore national unity in a democratic way has entered a new stage. The central idea of ​​a program adopted by the Congress is to counter the militarist bloc formed in West Germany with the great unity of workers, that is, uniting all Social Democratic workers, Communist workers, trade union members, non-party workers, and Christian workers. Therefore, in West Germany, the establishment of unified action of the working class is the most urgent task at present. The German Democratic Republic is a powerful and reliable fortress for the German people to carry out their national struggle. The main task in the future is to strengthen and consolidate the German Democratic Republic. Oelssner said: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is the leading force of the German working class and the German people. The Party is playing its leading role better in the national struggle and in the development of the Republic, and it will surely enable the working class to fulfill its great historical mission.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第十七期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十七期已经出版。
    本期以“保卫和平是各国人民切身的事业”为题发表社论，纪念第一届世界保卫和平大会召开的五周年。社论指出：在过去五年中，世界和平运动扩大并巩固了它的群众基础，得到了新力量的补充而成为我们这个时代真正不可战胜的运动。今天，甚至和平事业最凶恶的敌人也不能不承认世界和平运动的成就，而不能不有所顾虑。各国人民维护和巩固和平的斗争已使得国际紧张局势初步露出了缓和的迹象。各国人民越来越相信，协商能够导向解决最复杂的国际问题。社论接着说：苏联关于建立欧洲所有国家的集体安全和缔结欧洲集体安全全欧条约的建议，越来越得到广大群众的积极支持。在亚洲，不但亚洲广大的人民而且亚洲许多政治家也坚决反对美国的侵略政策。和平事业的敌人在亚洲、远东，和世界其他部分的阴谋已经遭到强大的和平运动的打击。和平运动是能够挫败美国帝国主义者及其同伙的反人民的阴谋的。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的“争取意大利一切民族力量的大团结”，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员弗·厄斯纳的“德国统一社会党的战斗纲领”和匈牙利劳动青年联盟中央委员会书记雅·戈斯托尼的“匈牙利劳动青年联盟的农村工作”。
    陶里亚蒂的文章首先综述了目前国际的基本形势。他指出：美国的原子威胁和恫吓政策威胁着全世界的广大人民群众。因此，这就使得有可能开展一个运动，来团结在本质上、在社会性质和政治性质上彼此完全不同的力量，来开展一个真正保卫人类文明和拯救人类的运动。陶里亚蒂接着说：在意大利，社会主义运动团结了工人阶级绝大多数和大部分其他劳动群众、中产阶级和农民。另一方面，还存在着天主教群众的世界以及他们的组织和制度。除了天主教的上层领导外，天主教中间阶层和广大的天主教群众中有一大部分人早就站在我们这边来了，那些不和我们站在一起甚至还在反对我们的另一部分天主教徒，也已经和我们所领导的群众有着同样的要求了。所以，有极大的可能来取得互相的谅解、密切彼此的关系并达成协议。这就是我们必须走的道路。所以，我们要有新的方针和新的决定。
    厄斯纳的文章说：德国统一社会党最近在柏林举行第四次代表大会后，德国劳动人民和全体德国爱国者争取以民主方式恢复国家统一的斗争，已经进入了一个新的阶段。代表大会通过的一项纲领的中心思想是：以工人的大联合，即联合所有的社会民主党工人、共产党工人、工会会员、无党无派工人和基督教工人，来对抗在西德所组成的军国主义集团。因此，在西德，建立工人阶级的统一行动是当前最迫切的任务。德意志民主共和国是德国人民进行民族斗争的强大而可靠的堡垒。今后的主要任务就是加强和巩固德意志民主共和国。厄斯纳说：德国统一社会党是德国工人阶级和德国人民的领导力量。党在民族斗争方面和共和国发展方面，正在更好地发挥其领导作用，它一定能使工人阶级完成自己的伟大历史使命。　（新华社）
