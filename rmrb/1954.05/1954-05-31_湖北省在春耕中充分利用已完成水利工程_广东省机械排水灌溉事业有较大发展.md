Hubei Province Fully Utilizes Completed Water Conservancy Projects in Spring Ploughing
Guangdong Province Achieves Significant Development in Mechanical Drainage and Irrigation

The majority of farmland water conservancy projects in Hubei Province have been completed and are beginning to yield irrigation benefits. Preliminary statistics show that, with the exception of a few large-scale projects still under construction, the 2,200-plus kilometers of main, branch, and people's dikes along the Yangtze and Han Rivers have been generally reinforced. This involved completing over 25.9 million cubic meters of earthwork, 98 bank protection projects, and over 310,000 cubic meters of stonework. Furthermore, 551 potential hazards were identified through key explorations, greatly strengthening the dikes, improving their quality, and enhancing their flood resistance. In terms of large and medium-sized farmland water conservancy projects, 87 new sluice gates and reservoirs were built and 289 were repaired, adding over 1.04 million mu of newly benefited area (the original benefited area last year was over 1.5 million mu). More than 6,300 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects were newly constructed, and 250,000 were repaired. In addition, new types of drainage gates and drainage systems have been built in areas such as the People's Great Embankment, Nanping Embankment, and Zhangdu Lake, where state-owned farms are being prepared, completely eliminating the impact of waterlogging on over one million mu of farmland.

In the construction of water conservancy, many large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in various regions were built through the voluntary contribution of money and labor by the masses after raising their socialist consciousness, and through mutual aid and labor exchange. For example, the Jianjiaqiao Reservoir in Yingcheng, a project capable of irrigating 800 mu of farmland, received only a partial subsidy for equipment loans from the government; the rest was borne by the masses through reasonable labor contributions. In the construction of water conservancy, a number of mutual aid teams have been developed and consolidated through the exercise of collective labor. After water conservancy construction in Minqian Township, Yidu County, more than 30 new mutual aid teams were established, and 72 mutual aid teams were consolidated.

In the newly built and repaired large and medium-sized farmland water conservancy projects, all localities have begun to pay attention to the management and maintenance work after the completion of the projects. In terms of large-scale projects, specialized management institutions have been generally established, equipped with full-time management cadres. Medium and small-scale water conservancy projects have also begun to generally democratically elect a large number of water management personnel through mass water-use organizations, and implement a reasonable water-use system of "one hoe for water release" (i.e., a dedicated person is responsible for the unified allocation of water).

During this year's spring plowing, the newly built and repaired large, medium, and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have been fully utilized. Many large and medium-sized irrigation systems use surplus water during the slack farming season to fill the surrounding small ponds and weirs, in order to ensure water use in the irrigation area and expand the benefited area of the irrigation area. In Hongtu Township, Yichang County, 122 out of 134 weirs were filled using the Yaque Ridge rolling dam. This increased the water storage capacity of various usable water conservancy facilities, providing a source of water for drought resistance and seedling protection in the event of a possible drought season.

Guangdong Province's mechanical drainage and irrigation has achieved greater development in recent years. Last winter and this spring, sixteen new and improved projects were completed, installing 31 water pumps, totaling more than 1,200 horsepower. Including those previously installed, the province has more than 400 water pumps with over 10,000 horsepower, which can effectively control a benefited area of more than 250,000 mu.

Guangdong Province has many enclosed fields (围田). Every year from April to September, when the river rises, the water level outside the enclosure is higher than inside. The sluice gates on the enclosure cannot be opened, and the water inside the enclosure cannot be drained. In some other places, the river water is several feet lower than the field surface, making irrigation impossible during droughts. After the development of mechanical drainage and irrigation, farmers were helped to eliminate waterlogging and overcome drought disasters, bringing abundant harvests. In Nada Township, Xinhui County, more than 2,000 mu of enclosed fields suffered continuous heavy rain just after the seedlings were transplanted this spring, and the seedlings were on the verge of being submerged. They immediately started five water pumps and saved the seedlings. In the past, Gongle Township, Baoan, would have transplanted all the seedlings around the Qingming Festival, but this year, more than ten days after Qingming, the soil in the fields was still bleached by the sun. On April 15th, the county transported water pumps, installed them for pumping and irrigation, and solved the water shortage for more than 2,000 mu of fields. In Huangbu Township, Xinhui County, ten water pumps have been installed in recent years, relieving 90% of the low-lying waterlogged farmland from waterlogging disasters, and increasing the yield of farmland from an average of 150 jin per mu to more than 530 jin. Since the installation of water pumps in 1950, the township has increased rice production by more than 5 million jin, with an average increase in income of more than 1,000 jin per person. After the increase in farmers' income, production enthusiasm has soared. The township originally had 19 cattle, and now it has increased to 102.

    湖北省在春耕中充分利用已完成水利工程
    广东省机械排水灌溉事业有较大发展
    湖北省的农田水利工程大部竣工，并已开始取得灌溉效益。据初步统计：除个别大型工程还在继续施工外，长江、汉水沿岸二千二百余公里的干、支、民堤，普遍进行了培修。完成土方二千五百九十余万公方，护岸工程九十八处，石方三十一万余公方。并重点钻探出隐患五百五十一处，大大巩固了堤身，加强了堤质，增进了抗洪能力。大、中型农田水利工程方面，新建了水闸和水库八十七处，整修二百八十九处，新增受益面积一百零四万余亩
  （去年原有受益田一百五十万余亩），小型农田水利兴修六千三百多处，整修二十五万处。此外，在人民大垸、南屏垸、涨渡湖等准备建立国营农场的地区，都兴建起了新型的排水闸和排水系统，使百余万亩农田，完全免除了涝灾的影响。
    在兴修水利中，很多地区的大、中型水利工程是在群众提高社会主义觉悟后，自动出钱出力，换工互助兴修起来的。如应城简家桥水库是一个能灌溉八百亩农田的工程，政府只补助了一部分器材贷款，其余均由群众合理出工负担。在兴修水利中，由于集体劳动的锻炼，发展和巩固了一批互助组。宜都县民前乡兴修水利以后，新成立了三十余个互助组，有七十二个互助组得到了巩固。
    在新修和整修的大、中型农田水利工程中，各地都开始重视了工程完工以后的管理养护工作。在大型工程方面，普遍建立了专门的管理机构，配备了专职管理干部。中、小型水利工程，亦开始普遍通过群众的用水机构，民主推选了大量的行水人员，推行“一把锄头放水”（即由专人负责、统一分配用水）的合理用水制度。
    今年春耕期间，新修和整修的大、中、小型农田水利工程已充分利用起来。很多大、中型灌溉系统利用农闲余水，灌满周围小型塘堰，以保证灌区用水和扩大灌溉区的受益面积。仅宜昌县红土乡一百三十四口堰，就利用鸦雀岭滚水坝灌满了一百二十二口。这样增进了各种可能利用的水利设施的蓄水容量，对可能到来的干旱季节，提供了抗旱保苗的水源条件。

    广东省的机械排水灌溉事业，近年来有较大的发展。去冬今春又完成了新建和改进工程十六处，安装抽水机三十一台，共有一千二百多匹马力。连以前安装的在内，全省共有抽水机四百余台，一万余匹马力，可以有效地控制受益面积二十五万余亩。
    广东省有很多围田，每年四月到九月间江水上涨，围外水位高于围内，围上涵闸不能开放，围内渍水无法排除；另有些地方，江水低于田面数尺，天旱时又无法灌溉。机械排水灌溉事业发展后，帮助农民排除渍水、战胜旱灾，带来了丰盛的收获。新会县那大乡的二千多亩围田，今春刚插下秧就遭到连续大雨，禾苗眼看浸死，他们立即开动五台抽水机，救活了禾苗。宝安共乐乡往年在清明前后便全部插秧，今年已过了清明十来天，田里泥土还晒得发白。四月十五日，县里运来抽水机，安装起来抽水灌溉，才解除了二千余亩田的缺水困难。新会县黄布乡几年来共安装了抽水机十台，使百分之九十低洼渍水农田解除了渍水灾害，农田产量由平均每亩一百五十市斤增加到五百三十多市斤。该乡自一九五○年安装抽水机以后，已增产稻谷五百多万斤，平均每人增加收入一千余斤。农民收入增加后，生产热情空前高涨，全乡原有耕牛十九头，现已增加到一百零二头。
