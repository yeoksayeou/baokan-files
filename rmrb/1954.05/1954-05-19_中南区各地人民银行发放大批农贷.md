People's Banks in various parts of the Central South Region are actively issuing large amounts of agricultural loans to help farmers with spring plowing. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of April, the region has issued 695.7 billion yuan in agricultural loans this year (including some water conservancy loans and production disaster relief loans issued starting last winter). By the end of March, Hunan Province had issued more than 150 billion yuan in loans. Currently, the loan issuance work in 59 counties and cities in the province has been basically completed. Other regions are still continuing to issue loans.

The timely issuance of large amounts of loans by People's Banks in the Central South Region has helped farmers solve some difficulties in production and livelihood, and has strongly supported spring plowing. According to statistics from ten counties in Hunan Province in March, a total of 31.52 billion yuan in loans was issued, helping farmers purchase 109,100 dan of dried cakes, 777,000 dan of lime, more than 160 dan of seeds, more than 9,000 waterwheels, more than 8,800 head of livestock, and 100,000 small farm tools. They also helped repair 16,000 ponds and dams, 57 reservoirs, and 376 dikes and embankments. In addition, they also helped some farmers solve some difficulties in sideline production. The loans issued by the Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank of China in areas affected by floods have played a significant role in supporting the people in disaster areas to carry out production and disaster relief.

This year, People's Banks in various parts of Central South have made many improvements in the methods of issuing loans. In general, the loans can be issued in accordance with actual needs, while overcoming the shortcomings of overly complicated procedures. This year, when issuing loans, People's Banks in various regions have paid special attention to cooperating with rural credit cooperative organizations. Some entrust credit cooperative organizations to issue some of the loans on their behalf; some provide credit cooperative organizations with a batch of funds, which they combine with their own funds for lending; some divide the lending work according to different objects or different purposes between the bank and the credit cooperative organization. This fully exerts the strength of the state banks and the mass credit cooperative organizations, effectively curbing usury activities and supporting spring plowing production. In many areas such as the 13th District of Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, the People's Bank and the supply and marketing cooperatives have closely cooperated, issuing loans and supplying means of production at the same time, which has been welcomed by the farmers.

    中南区各地人民银行发放大批农贷
    中南区各地人民银行积极发放大批农业贷款，帮助农民进行春耕生产。据不完全统计，到四月底止，全区今年已发放六千九百五十七亿元农业贷款（包括一部分去年冬季开始发放的水利贷款和生产救灾贷款）。湖南省到三月底止，即已发放出一千五百余亿元贷款，目前该省有五十九个县、市的发放贷款工作已经基本结束。其他地区仍在继续发放中。
    中南区各地人民银行及时发放大批贷款，帮助农民解决了生产及生活上的一些困难，有力地支持了春耕生产。据湖南省十个县三月份的统计，共发放贷款三百一十五亿二千万元，帮助农民购买枯饼十万九千一百担、石灰七十七万七千担、种籽一百六十多担、水车九千多辆、牲口八千八百余头、小农具十万件，兴修塘坝一万六千座、水库五十七个、堤垸三百七十六条，另外还帮助部分农户解决了副业生产等方面的一些困难。中国人民银行广东省分行在遭受水灾地区发放的贷款，对支持灾区人民生产救灾起了很大作用。
    今年中南各地人民银行发放贷款的方法有不少改进，一般都能使贷款发放得符合实际需要，同时克服了手续过分复杂等缺点。各地人民银行今年发放贷款时，特别注意和农村信用合作组织互相配合。有的将一部分贷款委托信用合作组织代为发放；有的供给信用合作组织一批资金，由它们结合自有资金进行贷放；有的按不同对象或不同用途，由银行和信用合作组织分工贷放。这样就充分发挥了国家银行和群众信用合作组织的力量，有力地制止了高利贷活动，支持了春耕生产。江西省鄱阳县第十三区等许多地区，人民银行和供销合作社密切配合，一面发放贷款，一面供应生产资料，受到了农民的欢迎。　（本报中南记者站）
