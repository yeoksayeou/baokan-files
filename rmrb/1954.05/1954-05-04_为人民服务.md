Serve the People
Ta. Tailuowa, Master of Technical Sciences, Lecturer at the Azerbaijan Institute of Industry

Not long ago, our country concluded the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The working people of the Sabirabad electoral district gave me a great honor by electing me, a woman from Baku, as a representative to the Nationalities Chamber.

According to the tradition of our people, the representative candidates should meet their voters at a general assembly. The kind and concerned faces of the voters who came to meet the representatives are unforgettable. The sincere, enthusiastic, and strict words of the collective farmers, machine tractor station workers, agronomists, and teachers are also forever etched in one's mind. They expressed their high trust in us and also reminded us of the noble responsibility of the representatives.

Comrade Gaziyeva, an ordinary collective farmer from the Shatalinsky district, said: "Comrade Tailuowa, remember that the representative is a servant of the people. Always be with the people, care about everything the people care about, and do not abandon this sacred duty. We will also help our dear regime, our Communist Party, with our loyal and selfless labor."

Listening to these words, I pondered their profound and significant meaning. The people elect their own regime; workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals send people like them to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. How can the representatives not serve the interests of the people faithfully?

As a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, I cannot help but feel the strict demands of the voters and their close ties with the representatives. Residents of the Baku-Shuvilan electoral district often come to me to talk about various social and personal issues that concern them.

Let me give just two examples. A group of voters raised the possibility of installing gas in the two villages of Zherei and Tukyanei, where most of the oil workers live, and asked for help in solving this problem. To solve the problem of laying gas pipelines in the above-mentioned villages, I visited the state organs of the republic and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry of the Soviet Union. A group of girls from a suburban collective farm who had just graduated from high school asked me to help them choose a major. They accepted my friendly advice and expressed their gratitude for my help in getting them into the normal college.

At the pre-election meeting in the Sabirabad electoral district not long ago, the voters expressed critical opinions and put forward many valuable suggestions on improving the facilities of Sabirabad City, electrifying the collective farms in the Shatalinsky district, and constructing two middle school buildings. I had requested the assistance of Comrade Mekhti-Satt, Minister of Education of the Republic, and recently received a reply: the school buildings in Sabirabad and Shatalinsky have been included in the new construction plan. I think that other suggestions from the voters will soon be realized as well.

It should be pointed out that the requests made by the workers to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers of the Republic, to the local Soviets and other organs, are always supported and quickly answered. But sometimes only the intervention of the representatives promotes the study of the important opinions of the working people. The voters' letters and suggestions not only help us to raise specific issues, but also can improve the work of state organs.

Whenever the requests of the voters get good results, the representatives are satisfied. It is pleasant to realize that your activities as a representative are so closely linked with the surrounding life and the urgent needs of the residents. Then you will feel very at ease when you go to various places in your constituency.

All this makes me even more pleased, because in the old Azerbaijan before the revolution, women were completely unable to participate in social and national activities, but in the current Supreme Soviet of the Republic, 30 percent of the representatives are women. Fifteen women from Azerbaijan have been elected as representatives to the new Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Among them are Baku petroleum engineer Su. Alikbekbelova, Lian. Rajimova, a female worker at the Ordubad Cannery, Sha. Gasanova, chairman of the "May 1st" collective farm in the Kalenjin district, who has twice won the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and Ki. Virgilieva, a collective farm squad leader in the Yevlakh district.

In our country, these are the people who discuss and formulate laws and promote these laws in factories, collective farms, and scientific institutions. All the time—whether at the meetings of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in the Kremlin, or in the daily rush of the representatives, or in their own labor posts, we are serving the people and our dear motherland. This is the happiness of great humanity.

    为人民服务
    苏联技术科学硕士  阿塞拜疆工业学院讲师  塔·塔伊洛娃
    不久前，我们国家结束了苏联最高苏维埃的选举。萨比拉巴德选区的劳动人民给了我很大的荣誉，把我这个巴库妇女选为民族院的代表。
    按照我国人民的传统，代表候选人要在大会上会见自己的选民。前来会晤代表的那些选民的和蔼而关切的面容，是令人难忘的。集体农民、机器拖拉机站工人、农学家和教师的真挚、热情而且严格的话，也永远使人记在心头。他们表示出对我们的高度信任，同时也提起我们注意代表的崇高责任。
    从沙塔林区来的普通的集体农民加齐耶娃同志说：“塔伊洛娃同志，要记住代表是人民的公仆。要永远和人民在一起，关心人民所关心的一切，不要放弃这个神圣的职责。我们也将以自己忠诚的和忘我的劳动来帮助亲爱的政权、我们的共产党。”
    我听了这些话，思索着它们的深刻的和重大的意义。人民自己选举自己的政权；工人、集体农民和知识分子把和他们一样的人派到苏联最高苏维埃去。代表们怎么能不为人民的利益而忠诚服务呢。
    作为一个苏联最高苏维埃代表的我，不能不感觉到选民的这种严格要求和他们与代表们的那种血肉联系。巴库—叔维良选区的居民经常来找我谈各种各样的、他们所关心的社会问题和个人问题。
    只举两个例子吧。一批选民提出了居住着大部分石油工人的热雷和土克雅耐两个村庄装置煤气的可能，并要求帮助解决这个问题。为了解决在上述村庄敷设煤气管的问题，我访问了共和国的国家机关和苏联石油工业部。一批刚从中学毕业的郊区集体农庄的姑娘，要求我帮助她们选择一门专业。她们接受了我的友谊的劝告，并对我帮助她们进入师范学院表示感谢。
    在不久前举行的萨比拉巴德选区的选前大会上，选民们谈出了批评性的意见，并提出了有关改善萨比拉巴德城设备、把沙塔林区的集体农庄电气化、建筑两个中学用的大厦的许多宝贵建议。我曾要求共和国教育部部长梅赫基—萨特同志的帮助，最近得到了回答：萨比拉巴德和沙塔林的学校建筑已包括在新的建设计划之内。我想，选民的其他建议不久也会实现的。
    应该指出，劳动者向共和国最高苏维埃主席团和部长会议、向地方苏维埃和其他机关所提出的请求，总是得到支持和迅速的答复。但是有时候只有代表的干涉才推动着去研究劳动人民的重要意见。选民的信件、建议不仅帮助我们提出具体的问题，而且也可以改善国家机关的工作。
    每当选民的请求得到良好的结果时，代表是会感到满意的。当意识到你这个代表的活动是和周围的生活、和居民的迫切需求那么紧密地联系着的时候，是愉快的。于是你到自己选区内的各地去时，也会感到是很坦然的。
    所有这一切都使我更加愉快，因为在革命前的旧阿塞拜疆，妇女完全不能参加社会活动和国家活动，但是在现在的共和国最高苏维埃中有百分之三十的代表是妇女。有十五位阿塞拜疆的妇女被选为新的苏联最高苏维埃代表。其中有巴库石油工程师苏·阿历克贝洛娃、奥尔杜巴德罐头工厂女工连·拉吉莫娃、两度获得社会主义劳动英雄称号、卡连金区“五一”集体农庄主席沙·加沙诺娃以及叶夫拉赫区集体农庄小队长基·维尔吉也娃。
    在我们国家里，就是这些人讨论和制订法律，并把这些法律推行到工厂、集体农庄和科学机关中去。所有的时间——无论在克里姆林宫的苏联最高苏维埃的会议上、或者在代表的日常的奔忙中，或者在自己的劳动岗位上，我们都是为人民和亲爱的祖国服务的。这就是伟大的人类的幸福。
