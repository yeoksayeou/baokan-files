Xi'an Municipal Construction is Expanding Vigorously

    Xi'an's municipal construction is expanding vigorously. According to the preliminary urban planning and industrial distribution, the city has determined that this year's urban public utilities construction will first create conditions for industrial capital construction, while appropriately solving transportation and drainage problems in the cultural and educational areas, and taking care of the urgent needs of urban residents. The city's total investment in public utilities capital construction this year will more than double that of last year. The focus of investment is on basic construction projects such as roads, water supply, and sewers.

    With the development of industrial construction, of the fourteen roads scheduled to be built this year, about three-quarters of the area is distributed in industrial zones, with a total length of more than 35 kilometers (25 kilometers were built last year). In order to solve the water used for industrial capital construction and industrial production, in addition to expanding the existing West Suburb Waterworks, it has been decided to build two more water supply branch plants, and expand the 4 to 12-inch water distribution network by more than 33 kilometers, which is almost twice the length of last year. Five new main and branch sewers will be built, with a total length of 16 kilometers, an increase of two times over last year, two of which lead to the industrial zone and are used for drainage in the industrial zone. In addition, municipal facilities such as urban transportation, park green spaces, and children's playgrounds will also be improved.

    At present, the above-mentioned road, water supply, and sewer projects are being actively carried out. The old roads in the city have also been basically renovated. The face of Xi'an is changing day by day with the development of industrial construction.

    西安市政建设正大力扩展中
    西安市的市政建设正在大力扩展中。依照初步确定的城市规划与工业分布情况，该市确定今年的城市公用事业建设首先为工业基本建设开创条件，同时适当地解决文教区交通排水问题，并照顾城市居民的迫切需要。该市今年投资于公用事业基本建设的总额比去年增加一倍多。投资的重点是道路、自来水和下水道等基本建设工程。
    随着工业建设的发展，今年确定修筑的十四条道路，约有四分之三的面积，分布在工业区内，全长三十五公里多（去年修筑二十五公里）。为解决工业基本建设和工业生产的用水，除扩建现有西郊自来水总厂外，决定再增建两个自来水分厂，并扩建四至十二吋配水网三十三公里多，其长度将近去年的两倍。新建下水道干管及支管五条，共长十六公里，比去年增加两倍，其中两条是通往工业区，为工业区排水用的。此外，并将改进城市交通、公园绿地及充实儿童运动场等市政设施。
    目前，上述道路、自来水、下水道等工程正在积极进行。城内旧有道路亦已基本上翻修完毕。西安市的面貌正在随着工业建设的发展而日新月异。
