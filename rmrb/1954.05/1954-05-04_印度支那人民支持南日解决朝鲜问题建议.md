(Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd) According to the Vietnam News Agency: The people of Indochina welcome and support the proposal made by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, at the Geneva Conference for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    At the Geneva Conference on April 27, the absurd remarks of the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique exposed the unwillingness of the Syngman Rhee puppet group to sincerely resolve the Korean question through peaceful means.
    Foreign Minister Nam Il's attitude was the opposite of the above. Nam Il's speech and the plan he put forward clearly expressed the attitude and主張 of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, namely to establish an independent, unified, and democratic Korea as soon as possible.
    The attitude of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is correct, and its proposal is reasonable, with the aim of effectively solving the Korean question through peaceful means. This attitude fully accords with the wishes of all the people of North and South Korea: they are eager to peacefully unify Korea into a unified, independent, and democratic country. The establishment of a truly independent and unified Korea will greatly help strengthen peace in the Far East and the rest of the world.
    The correct proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il is the voice of the Korean people and the Asian people demanding true peace. These proposals are practical and feasible measures to prevent the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war in the Far East.
    American interventionists and French colonialists are ravaging the land and culture of the Indochinese people, just like the barbarous acts of the US imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. Like all other progressive humanity, the Indochinese people, who have been carrying out a patriotic struggle against imperialist aggressors, express deep sympathy for the Korean people's struggle for national liberation. The Indochinese people fully agree with and enthusiastically support the position of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    印度支那人民支持南日解决朝鲜问题建议
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：印度支那人民欢迎并支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在日内瓦会议上所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    在四月二十七日的日内瓦会议上，李承晚集团代表的荒谬的发言，暴露了李承晚傀儡集团不愿真诚地通过和平的方式来解决朝鲜问题。
    南日外务相的态度和上述态度相反。南日的发言和他提出的方案明确地表示了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的态度和主张，即尽速建立一个独立、统一和民主的朝鲜。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的态度是正确的，它的建议是合理的，其目的在于通过和平方式有效地解决朝鲜问题。这种态度完全符合于全体南北朝鲜人民的愿望：他们渴望以和平方式把朝鲜统一成一个统一、独立、民主的国家。建立一个真正独立和统一的朝鲜，将大大有助于加强远东和世界其他地方的和平。
    南日外务相提出的正确建议是朝鲜人民以及亚洲人民要求真正和平的声音。这些建议是防止美帝国主义者想在远东扩大战争阴谋的切实可行的措施。
    美国干涉者和法国殖民者蹂躏着印度支那人民的国土和文化，正如美帝国主义侵略者对朝鲜人民所干的野蛮行径一样。像其他所有的进步人类一样，一直在对帝国主义侵略者进行爱国斗争的印度支那人民对朝鲜人民争取民族解放的斗争表示深切的同情。印度支那人民完全同意并热烈地支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的立场。
