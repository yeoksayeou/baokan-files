(Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 14) According to a report by Agence France-Presse from Washington on May 13, the U.S. government's administrative department released a document on the 12th allegedly compiled by "probably a CCP organization," the "Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Aid Vietnam." The report said that the document was about three thousand words long, a part of which was titled "Handbook for Political Workers Going to Vietnam." It also said: A Soviet advisory committee was attached to this "CCP organization."

The spokesman of the Chinese delegation pointed out that the document released by the U.S. government's administrative department is a complete fabrication. This rumor originated from U.S. official institutions, and its purpose is clearly to cover up the U.S. government's interference in the Indochina war and to create and prepare public opinion for further expansion and direct participation in the war.

    我国代表团发言人
    揭穿美国官方的造谣
    【新华社日内瓦十四日电】根据法新社华盛顿五月十三日报道，美国政府行政管理部门十二日公布了一个据说由“大概是一个中共的组织”“中国人民援越志愿军”编纂的文件。该报道说，文件约三千言，其中有一部分名为“赴越政工人员手册”。又说：有一个苏联顾问委员会附设在这个“中共的组织”之下。
    中国代表团发言人指出，美国政府行政管理部门公布的文件是彻头彻尾的捏造事实。这种谣言发源于美国官方机构，目的显然是为了掩盖美国政府对印度支那战争的干涉行为，并为它进一步扩大和直接参加战争制造和准备舆论。
