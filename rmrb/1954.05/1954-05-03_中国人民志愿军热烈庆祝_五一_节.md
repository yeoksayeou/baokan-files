He called on the entire army to resolutely abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement, heighten vigilance, prevent any enemy attacks and sabotage activities, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland and world peace.

On the morning of "May Day," commanders and fighters of all units of the Volunteer Army gathered around loudspeakers, waiting to listen to the live broadcast of the celebration rally in the capital. When the loudspeaker broadcast the cheers of "Chairman Mao is here!" the commanders and fighters listening to the broadcast immediately shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Many organs and companies of the Volunteer Army also invited representatives of the Korean people to participate in the "May Day" celebrations of the troops. Some units also sent representatives to Korean factories and mines to celebrate "May Day" with the Korean people. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
