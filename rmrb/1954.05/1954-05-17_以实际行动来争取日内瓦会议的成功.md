    Taking Practical Actions to Strive for the Success of the Geneva Conference
    Editor's Note: The following are selected letters from advanced workers in our country. They all express keen concern for the Geneva Conference and express their intention to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference through practical actions.
    The Chinese People's Desire for Peace
    Zhang Mingshan, National Model Worker
    The Geneva Conference has opened. Like all peace-loving people, we workers are eagerly hoping that this conference will achieve satisfactory results that meet the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries.
    Everyone wants to live a peaceful and happy life. We workers work hard to produce and create wealth in order to continuously improve the people's lives and to defend and consolidate world peace. Take our small rolling mill at Anshan Iron and Steel Company as an example. We now overfulfill our production tasks every month, and we continue to improve production. All the workers in the factory work selflessly. More than twenty labor models have emerged, and there have been many inventions. The production process has been basically mechanized. We are contributing our wisdom and strength to the bright future of the socialist industrialization of our motherland. In order to defend our fruits of labor and our increasingly better life, we need peace and strive for a peaceful environment with all our strength. For us, peace and labor are equally cherished.
    However, we also clearly see and closely guard against the fact that the enemies of peace are using various conspiracies and tricks to undermine peace and constantly create international tensions. The US ruling clique does not want the Geneva Conference to succeed. They are doing their best to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, expand interference in the Indochina war, and continue to be hostile to the People's Republic of China. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country cannot ignore this. We must crush it together with the peace-loving people all over the world.
    We believe that the Korean issue and the issue of restoring peace in Indochina should be resolved rationally through consultation. The Geneva Conference provides great possibilities for this. The Korean people should restore the unification of the country by themselves without foreign interference, and this must begin with the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. The people of Indochina must also have the right to peace, national freedom and independence. This is the wish of the Korean and Indochinese people, and it is also the common wish of all peace-loving and nationally independent people in Asia. This wish of the Asian people must be realized. The Asian people are working together to maintain peace and security in Asia. The delegations of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam have put forward just proposals, and we Chinese people firmly support them and are willing to unite with the people of all countries, establish peaceful and friendly cooperative relations, and strive for the success of the Geneva Conference.
    Supporting the Settlement of International Disputes Through Consultation
                  Zhu Guohua, National Industrial Labor Model
    We Chinese workers are not only concerned about our own national affairs, but also about world affairs. Because we and the people all over the world have a common desire, which is peace. We support resolving any international disputes with sincerity and consultation. We are closely following the Geneva Conference, which is discussing urgent issues in Asia, and hope that this conference will be successful in further consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    The Chinese people, especially the working people, deeply know how precious peaceful life and creative labor are. For myself, this experience is also very profound. When I was a student, I lost my job and could not make a living due to the invasion of the Japanese devils. Later, although I entered the factory, I still lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear, and being beaten and scolded. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, US imperialism supported the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to launch a counter-revolutionary civil war, and the workers in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's ruling area were plunged into unemployment and starvation. But we resolutely fought, and finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people won the victory in the struggle for national independence and democratic freedom. The whole country was liberated, we became the masters of the country, and we devoted ourselves to the work of restoring and developing the national economy.
    I work in an oxygen production workshop in a petroleum factory. Due to the joint efforts of me and my fellow workers, we created a new record in oxygen production. The output exceeded the highest output before liberation by three times, and the quality also exceeded the previous level. I was also promoted from a worker who was looked down upon in the old society to the director of the workshop. In 1950, I was also elected as a national industrial labor model and attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.
    In August 1951, I was selected to enter the first new-type regular university in New China - Renmin University of China - to study. The motherland wants to train us to become a completely new type of intellectual.
    Millions of working people have also embarked on the road of a new life like me. This is the fruit of countless revolutionary fighters' bloodshed. In order to defend this fruit of victory and no longer live such a hard life as before, what we working people are most concerned about is lasting world peace and the construction of the motherland; only peace can enable us to smoothly engage in creative labor, can make our motherland increasingly prosperous and prosperous, and make the lives of our working people improve day by day.
    Therefore, we resolutely oppose the US conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference, expand interference in the Indochina War, and establish aggressive blocs in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region.
    The American colonialists should know that a new era has arrived in Asia, and the era when imperialism wanted to conquer the Asian people with a few cannons and a few warships is gone forever. The victory of the Korean-Chinese People's forces in the Korean War and the fact that the Vietnamese People's Army liberated Dien Bien Phu vividly show that the imperialist policy of aggression against Asia is doomed to failure.
    Now, the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Geneva Conference have put forward reasonable proposals for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, and have received the full support of China and the Soviet Union. We firmly support the speech of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of our delegation, at the Geneva Conference; Foreign Minister Zhou's speech represents the loud voice of the Asian people who have stood up and are increasingly awakened. We believe that the proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have paved the way for the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochina issues; if the authorities in the United States and France take a realistic attitude, they should honestly sit down and conduct realistic negotiations. The peace-loving people of all countries are closely watching them. If they dare to replace negotiations with war, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.
    Our Country's International Status Cannot Be Obliterated
    Guo Shude, former driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive
    When I saw in the newspaper that Foreign Minister Zhou had led a delegation to Geneva to attend the meeting, I felt infinitely excited and filled with hope. I hope that this conference will reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, so as to further ease international tensions and consolidate peace in Asia and the world. I believe that this is not only my personal wish, but also the lofty wish of the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, especially the people of Asian countries.
    We Chinese people, who have suffered deeply from imperialist aggression in the past, express our deep sympathy to the people who are currently engaged in anti-aggression struggles. We unanimously support the great efforts made by our government delegation and the delegations of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam for the solemn cause of peace.
    The US ruling clique is determined to ruin the Geneva Conference, and does not hesitate to use all the most despicable means to sabotage it, and to make unreasonable and ridiculous slanders and smears against our New China, in an attempt to devalue and obliterate the international status of the great People's Republic of China. But this only exposes the aggressive ambitions of the US ruling clique to be hostile to the Chinese people, but it cannot damage the increasing improvement of our country's international reputation and status. The convening of the Geneva Conference clearly shows China's important position in Asian and international affairs. The speech of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of our delegation, at the Geneva Conference has received widespread attention from all countries' opinions, and is considered to represent the common wish of the Asian people. People from all countries have also written letters to pay tribute to our delegation. This shows that our country's international status and reputation are unshakable.
    We workers love the motherland and also love peace; we are not only concerned about the peace and security of our own motherland, but also about the peace and security of Asia and the whole world. Precisely because of this, the railway workers of China have participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and shed blood, and even contributed their precious lives. We will never allow the US aggressors to sabotage peace in Korea. We also sympathize with the just struggle of the Indochinese people for national independence and freedom. The Chinese people believe that the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have every right to obtain their national independence, national unification, and democratic freedom, and live a peaceful life on the land of their own motherland. This is completely justified.
    At present, our country is carrying out large-scale economic construction. We workers will participate in the great cause of socialist industrialization in our country with selfless labor, and at the same time, redouble our vigilance to defend the security of our country, and persist in the struggle to defend and consolidate world peace.
    For the sake of peace, we must take practical actions to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference. We should give play to our initiative and creativity in our production posts, and tap potential forces, so that railway transportation can further meet the needs of the ever-developing national economy. We fully realize that every achievement in our country's construction is also increasing the strength of the peace camp, and it is a serious blow to the US warmongering clique that is doing its best to sabotage the Geneva Conference.
    Strive for the Success of the Geneva Conference
                  Kang Yongxiang, Industrial Labor Model of Shanxi Province
    The convening of the Geneva Conference makes us feel very excited, because it fully demonstrates the victory of the forces striving to resolve international disputes through consultation, and demonstrates that the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day.
    We Chinese people have great expectations for the Geneva Conference, hoping that this conference can peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina, so that international tensions can be further eased. Therefore, we feel extremely indignant at the US imperialist conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference.
    At present, we are taking action to step up production to support the success of the Geneva Conference and maintain the cause of world peace. Our tunneling team has completed the first quarter's production plan across the board four days ahead of schedule. On this basis, in accordance with the spirit of the general task of our country's transition period, we have conducted inspections and summaries, and formulated a production increase and frugality plan for the second quarter. In order to ensure the implementation of this plan, in April we promoted the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "parallel crack blasting method" on the basis of consolidating the "triangular slotting" technical measures, and the progress efficiency of each mortar was gradually increased from the original 1.6 meters to 2 meters, and strived to reach a progress level of more than 2.5 meters. This new technology not only guarantees the completion of our production tasks, but also creates favorable conditions for fully exploiting the underground resources of the motherland. We have also consolidated the comprehensive responsibility system for environmental protection and safety and the "finished product shed method", so the cost of coal has been safely reduced. In order to ensure that the quality of coal is not reduced, we have also adopted effective measures of three slag selection (tunneling slag selection, transportation slag selection, loading slag selection). Therefore, in the first half of April, we safely, comprehensively, and evenly completed the production plan. Coal output exceeded the plan by 25.5 percent, the equilibrium rate reached 100 percent, the attendance rate increased by 1.18 percent compared to the plan, the cost of each ton of coal was reduced by 8.27 percent compared to the national target, and the quality of coal increased by 0.27 percent compared to March. We have made up our minds that during the Geneva Conference, we will create greater achievements in production to show the Chinese people's firm determination and great strength to defend peace and oppose aggressive war.
    Now, the Geneva Conference is constantly overcoming the difficulties and sabotage conspiracies created by Dulles and his ilk, under the joint efforts of the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam, and all forces that wish to resolve international disputes peacefully, and is moving towards seeking a peaceful solution to the Korean and Indochina issues; We believe that the united strength of the peace-loving people of all countries can frustrate the conspiracy of the enemies of peace to sabotage the Geneva Conference. We are willing to unite with the peace-loving people of all countries and work hard to ensure the success of the Geneva Conference.

### 以实际行动来争取日内瓦会议的成功

    以实际行动来争取日内瓦会议的成功
    编者按：下面选登的是我国先进工人的来信。他们对日内瓦会议一致寄予殷切的关怀，并表示以实际行动来争取日内瓦会议的成功。
    中国人民的和平愿望
    全国劳动模范　张明山
    日内瓦会议开幕了。我们工人和所有爱好和平的人们一样，热切希望这个会议能得到符合各国人民和平愿望的圆满结果。
    每个人都希望过和平幸福的生活。我们工人努力生产，创造财富，就是为了不断地改善和提高人民的生活，就是为了保卫和巩固世界的和平。拿我们鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂来说，现在每月都超额完成生产任务，我们还继续地在提高生产。全厂工人忘我地劳动，出现了二十几个劳动模范，有了许多创造发明，生产过程已基本上机械化了。我们正在为祖国的社会主义工业化的美好远景而贡献出我们的智慧和力量。为了保卫我们的劳动果实和一天天美好的生活，我们需要和平，并全力来争取和平的环境。对我们来说，和平和劳动同样是我们所珍视的。
    但是，我们也清楚地看到并严密地警惕着：和平的敌人正在施用各种阴谋诡计来破坏和平，不断制造国际紧张局势。美国统治集团是不要日内瓦会议成功的，它们竭力阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，扩大干涉印度支那战争，并且继续敌视中华人民共和国。中国工人阶级和全国人民对此不能置之不理，我们一定要和全世界爱好和平的人民一起把它粉碎。
    我们认为，朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题都应该以协商方式求得合理的解决。日内瓦会议为此提供了很大的可能性。朝鲜人民应该在没有外国的干涉下，由自己来恢复国家的统一，而这首先必须从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。印度支那人民也必须得到和平和民族自由、独立的权利。这是朝鲜人民和印度支那人民的愿望，也是一切爱好和平与民族独立的亚洲人民的共同愿望。亚洲人民的这种愿望是必须实现的。亚洲人民正在为维护亚洲的和平与安全而共同努力。中、苏、朝、越代表团已提出了正义的主张，我们中国人民坚决表示支持，并愿与各国人民团结一致，建立和平友好合作的关系，争取日内瓦会议的成功。
    拥护以协商方式解决国际争端
                  全国工业劳动模范　朱国华
    我们中国工人不仅关心自己的国家大事，而且关心世界大事。因为我们和普天下的人民都有着一个共同的愿望，这就是和平。我们拥护以诚意和协商来解决任何的国际争端。我们正在密切地关注讨论亚洲迫切问题的日内瓦会议，并希望这个会议能获得成功，以进一步巩固亚洲和世界的和平。
    中国人民，特别是劳动人民，深知和平生活和创造性的劳动是多么珍贵。以我自己来说，这种体会也是非常深刻的。还在求学的少年时代，我就由于日本鬼子的侵略，失业在家，无法生活；后来虽然进了工厂，但仍过着吃不饱穿不暖、挨打受骂的生活。抗日战争胜利后，美帝国主义又支持蒋介石匪帮发动了反人民的内战，我们当时在蒋匪帮统治区的工人又陷入了失业、饥饿的境地。但我们坚决进行斗争，终于在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民争取民族独立与民主自由的斗争取得了胜利，全国解放了，我们成了国家的主人翁，投入了恢复和发展国民经济的工作。
    我在一个石油工厂制氧气车间工作，由于我和工人同志们的共同努力，创造了制造氧气的新纪录，产量超过解放前最高产量的三倍，质量也超过以前的水平。我也由一个在旧社会被人瞧不起的工人提升为车间主任，一九五○年还当选为全国工业劳动模范，出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。
    一九五一年八月，我又被选派进入了新中国的第一所新型正规大学——中国人民大学来学习。祖国要培养我们成为一个完全新型的知识分子。
    千百万的劳动人民也都和我一样走上了新生活的道路。这是无数革命战士用鲜血换来的果实。为了保卫这个胜利果实，不再过从前那样的苦难生活，我们劳动人民所最关心的就是世界的持久和平和祖国的建设；只有和平，才能使我们顺利地从事创造性的劳动，才能使我们的祖国日益昌盛和繁荣，使我们劳动人民的生活天天向上。
    因此，我们坚决反对美国破坏日内瓦会议，扩大干涉印度支那战争，并在东南亚和西太平洋地区建立侵略集团的阴谋。
    美国殖民者应该知道，亚洲的新时代已经到来了，帝国主义用几尊大炮和几艘兵舰就想征服亚洲人民的时代已经一去不复返了。朝中人民部队在朝鲜战争中的胜利和越南人民军解放奠边府的事实，就生动地表明了帝国主义侵略亚洲的政策是注定要失败的。
    现在，出席日内瓦会议的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国代表团已提出了和平解决朝鲜问题和和平解决印度支那问题的合理建议，并得到中苏两国的全力支持。我们坚决拥护我国代表团首席代表周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言；周外长的发言代表了已经站起来日益觉醒的亚洲人民的宏亮的声音。我们认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国所提出的建议，已为和平解决朝鲜和印度支那问题开辟了道路；美国和法国的当权者，如果抱着现实的态度，就应该老老实实地坐下来，进行实事求是的谈判。各国爱好和平的人民正在密切地注视着他们。如果他们胆敢用战争来代替谈判，他们就必将遭到更惨重的失败。
    我国的国际地位是不容抹煞的
    前“毛泽东号”机车司机长  郭树德
    当我从报上看到周外长已率领代表团赴日内瓦出席会议的消息时，心里感到无限兴奋，抱着无限的希望。我希望这次会议在和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题上能获得协议，以进一步缓和国际紧张局势，巩固亚洲及世界和平。我相信这不只是我个人的愿望，世界各国爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲各国人民也一定都怀着这种崇高的愿望。
    我们中国人民，过去深受帝国主义侵略的灾难，对目前正在进行反侵略斗争的人民表示深切的同情。我们一致支持自己的政府代表团和苏、朝、越三国代表团为了庄严的和平事业所作的重大努力。
    美国统治集团一心要搞垮日内瓦会议，不惜采用一切最卑劣的手段来进行破坏，并对我们新中国进行无理而且可笑的诽谤和诬蔑，企图贬低和抹煞伟大的中华人民共和国的国际地位，但这只是暴露了美国统治集团敌视中国人民的侵略野心，却丝毫也不能损害我国国际声望和地位的日益提高。这次日内瓦会议的召开，就很明显地表明中国在亚洲和国际事务上的重要地位。我国代表团首席代表周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言受到了各国舆论广泛的重视，认为他的发言代表着亚洲人民的共同愿望。各国人民并纷纷写信向我国代表团致敬。这都说明，我国的国际地位和声望是不可动摇的。
    我们工人是热爱祖国的，也是爱好和平的；我们不仅关心自己祖国的和平与安全，也同样关心亚洲和全世界的和平与安全。正是因为这样，中国的铁路职工们纷纷参加抗美援朝斗争，并流了鲜血，甚至贡献出了自己宝贵的生命。我们决不容许美国侵略者破坏朝鲜的和平。我们并且同情印度支那人民为了民族独立与自由而进行的正义斗争，中国人民认为越南、高棉、寮国人民有充分权利获得他们的民族独立、国家统一和民主自由，并在他们自己祖国的土地上过和平生活，这完全是天经地义的事。
    目前，我们国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，我们工人将以忘我的劳动来参加我国社会主义工业化的伟大事业，同时加倍提高警惕，保卫我们国家的安全，并为保卫和巩固世界和平而坚持斗争。
    为了和平，我们要以实际行动来争取日内瓦会议的成功。我们在生产岗位上当发挥积极性和创造性，挖掘潜在力量，使铁路运输能进一步满足国民经济日益发展的需要。我们充分认识到，我国建设事业上的每一个成就，也就是为和平阵营增加了力量，对正在竭力破坏日内瓦会议的美国好战集团则是一个严重的打击。
    争取日内瓦会议获得成功
                  山西省工业劳动模范　康永祥
    日内瓦会议的召开，使我们感到非常兴奋，因为它充分显示了争取以协商方式解决国际争端的势力的胜利，显示了中华人民共和国的国际威望一天比一天提高。
    我们中国人民对日内瓦会议怀着极大的期望，希望这个会议能够和平解决朝鲜问题，并恢复印度支那的和平，使国际紧张局势进一步缓和下来。因此，我们对美帝国主义企图破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋活动，感到极端的愤慨。
    目前我们正在以加紧生产的行动，来支持日内瓦会议的成功，维护世界的和平事业。我们掘进队已经提前四天全面完成了第一季度的生产计划。在这个基础上，根据我国过渡时期总任务的精神，我们又进行了检查和总结，订出第二季度的增产节约计划。为了保证这个计划的实现，四月份我们在巩固“三角掏槽”技术措施的基础上，推广了苏联
  “平行龟裂爆破法”的先进经验，每荏炮的进度效率由原来的一点六公尺逐步提高到两公尺，并争取达到两公尺五以上的进度水平。这一新的技术，不但保证了我们生产任务的完成，并为充分开采祖国地下资源创造了有利条件。我们还巩固了连环保安专责制和“成品搭棚法”，因此安全地降低了煤的成本。为了保证不降低煤的质量，我们还采取了三拣碴（掘进拣碴、运搬拣碴、装车拣碴）的有效措施。因此，四月上半月，我们安全地、全面地、均衡地完成了生产计划，煤产量超过计划百分之二十五点五，均衡率达到百分之百，出勤率比计划提高百分之一点一八，每吨煤的成本比国家指标降低了百分之八点二七，煤的质量比三月份提高百分之零点二七。我们已下定决心，在日内瓦会议开会的时期，我们在生产中要创造更大的成绩，以表示中国人民保卫和平、反对侵略战争的坚强决心和巨大力量。
    现在，日内瓦会议正在中、苏、朝、越四国代表团以及一切愿望以和平方式解决国际争端的力量的共同努力下，不断排除杜勒斯之流所制造的困难和破坏阴谋，向着谋求和平解决朝鲜和印度支那问题的道路上前进；我们相信各国爱好和平人民团结的力量，可以挫败和平敌人破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋。我们愿意与各国爱好和平人民团结起来，为保证日内瓦会议的成功而努力。
