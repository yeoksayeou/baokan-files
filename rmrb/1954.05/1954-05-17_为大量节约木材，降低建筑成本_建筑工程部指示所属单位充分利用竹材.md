    To Greatly Save Timber and Reduce Construction Costs
    Ministry of Construction Engineering Directs Subordinate Units to Fully Utilize Bamboo
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to greatly save timber, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering recently issued instructions to its subordinate units on the full utilization of bamboo. The instructions first pointed out the benefits of using bamboo: 1. According to Beijing's quota calculations, for a construction task of 10 million square meters, the bamboo scaffolding, bamboo scaffolding frames, and bamboo scaffolding boards alone can save approximately 600,000 to 700,000 cubic meters of timber. 2. Bamboo's tensile and compressive strength is more than twice that of pine and fir. Bamboo has great toughness and is not easily broken suddenly; if deformation is detected, remedial measures can be taken in time. Since the Beijing and Southwest Construction Engineering Bureaus started using bamboo, no accidents have occurred. In addition, moso bamboo is lighter than fir poles, making it easier to erect and dismantle, and more convenient to transport. 3. Using bamboo can greatly reduce construction costs. According to calculations by the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, the price of building sheds and scaffolding with moso bamboo is about one-third that of wood.
    The instructions then pointed out that at present, all units can fully utilize bamboo in the following two aspects: 1. General new temporary projects: such as site offices, dormitories, warehouses, dining halls, work sheds, toilets, bathrooms, and temporary workers' dormitories, etc., in which all except doors, windows, and floors can be made of bamboo; 2. Scaffolding and scaffolding boards: At present, bamboo scaffolding can be widely promoted for buildings of three stories or less. In order to better promote the use of bamboo, the instructions also pointed out: When formulating this year's technical organization measures plan for reducing construction costs, full consideration should be given to the use of bamboo; and the experience of using bamboo should be promoted, and workers should be educated. When using bamboo in northern non-bamboo-producing areas, an appropriate number of bamboo workers should be trained.

    为大量节约木材，降低建筑成本
    建筑工程部指示所属单位充分利用竹材
    【本报讯】中央建筑工程部为了大量节约木材，最近向所属各单位发出关于充分利用竹材的指示。指示首先指出了利用竹材的好处：一、按照北京市的定额计算，一千万平方公尺的建筑任务，仅竹工棚、竹脚手架、竹脚手板三项，就可节约木材约六、七十万立方公尺。二、竹材在抗拉、抗压强度上，都优于松木和杉木两倍以上。竹材具有很大的韧性，不易骤然折断；如发现变形，可及时采取补救的措施。北京及西南建筑工程局使用竹材以来从未发生事故。此外，毛竹比杉木杆轻，搭拆比较容易，搬运也比较方便。三、使用竹材，可大大降低建筑成本。根据华东建筑工程局计算，用毛竹搭建工棚和脚手架，与木料的价格相比，约为一比三左右。
    指示接着指出，目前各单位可在下列两方面充分使用竹材：一、一般新建暂设工程：如工地办公室、宿舍、仓库、饭厅、工作棚、厕所、浴室以及临时工人宿舍等，其中除门窗地板外，其他都可采用竹材；二、脚手架及脚手板：目前在三层以下的建筑物，可普遍推广竹脚手。为了很好地推广使用竹材，指示又指出：在制定本年的降低建筑成本的技术组织措施计划时，应充分考虑利用竹材；并推广使用竹材的经验，向职工进行教育，在北方非产竹地区利用竹材时，应培养适当数量的竹工。
