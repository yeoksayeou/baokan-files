    Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau No. 1 Power Plant

    Collectively Designs "Multi-Tube Dust Collector" to Reduce Coal Consumption

    The Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau No. 1 Power Plant completed the installation of the "Multi-Tube Dust Collector," collectively designed by the plant's employees, in the first quarter of this year, significantly reducing coal consumption.

    After the plant began generating electricity in 1950, it was discovered that there was a lot of fly ash from the chimneys, accounting for more than 7% of the total coal consumption. The combustibles contained in the fly ash were more than 75%, resulting in significant losses. At the end of 1952, the plant leadership proposed the task of "recovering fly ash and reducing costs," and mobilized all employees to put forward more than 30 suggestions. These suggestions were then analyzed and studied by technical personnel. Based on the characteristics of the plant's short flue and narrow space, a multi-tube dust collector was designed. The first dust collector was successfully installed at the end of June last year, recovering 2.28 tons of fly ash per day. The combustibles in this fly ash were then used to burn boilers for power generation. When the plant's technicians and workers installed the second dust collector in October last year, they made some improvements, adding ash hoppers, lengthening the tubes, and designing rifling inside the tubes. This enabled each dust collector to recover 3.05 tons of fly ash per day, increasing efficiency by 45% compared to the original. They then installed this type of dust collector on all the boilers, investing a total of 240 million yuan. The recoverable combustibles in one year are equivalent to more than 3,000 tons of coal, worth more than 570 million yuan. At the same time, due to the installation of dust collectors, coupled with improvements in worker operation, the plant's coal consumption, which had long remained at 0.629 kg per kilowatt-hour, began to decline significantly. In January and February of this year, it had dropped to 0.570 kg. According to the plant's calculations, if the reduction in coal consumption this year is calculated based on the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau's target of 0.58 kg (the original national target was 0.613 kg), more than 6,400 tons of coal can be saved throughout the year, worth approximately 1.21 billion yuan.

    武汉冶电业局第一发电厂
    集体设计“多管式集尘器”降低煤耗
    武汉冶电业局第一发电厂于今年第一季度完成该厂职工集体设计的“多管式集尘器”安装工作，使煤耗显著降低。
    该厂于一九五零年开始发电后，即发现烟囱飞灰很多，约占全部用煤量百分之七以上，而飞灰中所含的可燃物在百分之七十五以上，损失很大。一九五二年底，该厂领导上即提出“收回飞灰，降低成本”的课题，发动全体职工提出了三十来项建议，然后由技术人员分析研究，根据该厂烟道短、地位窄的特点，设计出多管式集尘器。第一个集尘器是在去年六月底安装成功，每天可收回飞灰二点二八吨，再将这些飞灰内的可燃物用来烧锅炉发电。去年十月该厂技术人员与工人们安装第二个集尘器时，又进行了若干改进，增加了灰斗，加长了管子，并在管内设计来复线，这就使一个集尘器每天可收回飞灰三点零五吨，比原来的效率提高百分之四十五。他们紧接着又在所有的锅炉上都安装了这种集尘器，一共投资二亿四千万元，而一年收回的可燃物相当于三千多吨燃煤，约值五亿七千多万元。同时由于安装了集尘器，与工人操作改进配合，使该厂长期停留在每度电零点六二九公斤的煤耗开始显著下降，今年一、二月份已降到零点五七零公斤。据该厂计算，今年煤耗的降低，如以武汉冶电业局指标零点五八公斤计算（国家原来指标为零点六一三公斤），全年可节省燃煤六千四百多吨，约值十二亿一千万元。  （曹葆铭）
