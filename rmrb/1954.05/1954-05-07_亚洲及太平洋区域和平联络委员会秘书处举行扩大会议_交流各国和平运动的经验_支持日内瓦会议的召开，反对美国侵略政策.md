Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, established according to the resolution of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in October 1952, held an enlarged Secretariat meeting in Beijing from May 3rd to 6th, 1954, to exchange the experiences of the people of various countries in the region in the cause of defending peace over the past year and a half.

Participating in the meeting were Secretary-General and Deputy Secretaries-General Liu Ningyi (China), Jose Venturelli (Chile), Togo Kameda (Japan), Jung Sung-un (Korea), and Kozhevnikov (Soviet Union). Also attending the meeting were Han Seol-ya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace; Mrs. Uti Arudji, Vice-Chairman of the Indonesian National Peace Committee; Tekin Lun, Vice-Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace; Liao Chengzhi, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace; H.D. Saksena, Director of the All-India Peace Council; Suruoso, Secretary-General of the Indonesian National Peace Committee; Kimiko Kaneko (Japan) and Louis Alley (New Zealand), members of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee; and representatives from Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and other countries.

The meeting proceeded throughout in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and friendship.

The meeting fully exchanged views on the international situation since the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the progress of the cause of defending peace by the people of various countries in the region, and the work of the Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee. It also broadly exchanged experiences on various activities carried out by peace organizations in various countries in the region, based on the vital interests and actual conditions of their own people, to defend peace and safeguard national independence and state sovereignty.

The meeting held that with the growth of the peace forces of the people of all countries in the world, the peace movement in various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions has achieved significant achievements in the past year and a half, and the friendship and unity of the people of various countries in the region have been further developed and consolidated in the common cause of maintaining peace.

The meeting unanimously pointed out: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement marks the failure of the US war-mongering clique's policy of strength and the great victory of the sacred cause of defending peace by peace-loving people all over the world, and it has somewhat eased international tensions. However, the US war-mongering clique is attempting to make the already eased international situation re-intensify. They are stepping up their infringement upon the national independence of Asian countries, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, establishing military bases and forcing the signing of military agreements everywhere, openly interfering in the Indochina War, openly plotting to organize aggressive blocs in Asia and the Pacific, rearming Japan and reviving militarism, imposing military aid on Pakistan and attempting to drag it into military aggressive blocs, massively manufacturing and testing atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs in the Pacific, and forcibly implementing blockades and embargoes and hostility towards independent and autonomous countries in Asia, especially hostility towards the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The meeting unanimously opposed and condemned all these aggressive policies and actions of the US aggressive clique, and pointed out that these aggressive policies and actions seriously threaten peace and security in Asia and the world, and have brought great disasters to the normal development of the economies, national cultures, people's lives, and democratic rights of various countries.

The participants expressed warm support for the Geneva Conference currently being held with the participation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, the United States, France, and other countries, and deeply hoped that it would reach agreements on peacefully resolving the Korean issue and restoring peace in Indochina. The meeting noted with regret that, due to the opposition and obstruction of the United States, Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon were unable to participate in the Geneva Conference.

The meeting supported the World Peace Council's special meeting of the Council to be held in Berlin at the end of May this year to further discuss various issues related to easing international tensions.

The participants are full of confidence that the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions will unite and cooperate more closely under the common goal of striving for peace and opposing aggression, and win new victories.

    【新华社六日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会扩大的秘书处会议发表公报，全文如下：
    根据一九五二年十月亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议决议而组成的亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处，为了交换一年半以来本地区各国人民在保卫和平事业中的经验，特于一九五四年五月三日至六日在北京召开了扩大的秘书处会议。
    参加这次会议的有正副秘书长刘宁一（中国）、何塞·万徒勒里（智利）、龟田东伍（日本）、郑圣彦（朝鲜）、科热夫尼柯夫（苏联）。参加会议的有朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长韩雪野、印尼全国和平委员会副主席尤蒂·阿鲁齐夫人、缅甸保卫世界和平委员会副主席德钦伦、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员廖承志、全印和平理事会理事希·萨克森纳、印尼全国和平委员会秘书长苏鲁梭和亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会委员金子健太（日本）、路易·艾黎（新西兰）以及越南、泰国、日本等国的代表。
    会议始终在互相了解与友好的气氛中进行。
    会议对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议以来的国际形势、本地区各国人民保卫和平事业的进展情况和亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处工作充分交换了意见，并就本地区各国和平组织根据本国人民的切身利益和实际情况、为保卫和平及保卫民族独立与国家主权所进行的各种活动广泛地交流了经验。
    会议认为随着世界各国人民和平力量的壮大，在一年半以来，亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平运动获得了重大成就，本地区各国人民的友谊和团结，在维护和平的共同事业中有了进一步的发展和巩固。
    会议一致指出：朝鲜停战协定的签定，标志着美国好战集团实力政策的失败和全世界爱好和平人民保卫和平的神圣事业的伟大胜利，而且使国际紧张局势有了一些缓和。但是，美国好战集团正在企图使已见缓和的国际局势重趋紧张。他们正加紧侵犯亚洲国家的民族独立，干涉别国内政，到处建立军事基地和强迫签订军事协定，公开干预印度支那战争，公开策动组织亚洲及太平洋的侵略集团，重新武装日本与复活军国主义，将军事援助强加于巴基斯坦并图将其拖入军事侵略集团，大规模制造并在太平洋试验原子武器与氢弹，强迫实行封锁禁运及敌视亚洲各独立自主国家，尤其是敌视苏联与中华人民共和国。会议一致反对与谴责美国侵略集团的这一切侵略政策和行为，并指出这些侵略政策和行为严重地威胁着亚洲及世界的和平与安全，对各国经济的正常发展、民族文化、人民生活与民主权利带来了很大的灾害。
    与会者表示热烈支持正在举行的有苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、中华人民共和国、英国、美国、法国及其他国家参加的日内瓦会议，深切地期望它能对和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议。会议遗憾地指出：由于美国的反对与阻挠，亚洲国家如印度、印尼、缅甸、巴基斯坦及锡兰等国都未能参加日内瓦会议。
    会议拥护世界和平理事会为了进一步商讨有关缓和国际紧张局势的各项问题而定于本年五月底在柏林召开的理事会特别会议。
    与会者满怀信心地看到亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，将在为争取和平、反对侵略的共同目标下，更紧密地团结合作，赢得新的胜利。
