    Hebei People's Broadcasting Station Donates Radios to Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Hebei People's Broadcasting Station recently sent twenty-eight four-tube dry cell radios to twenty-eight key agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province. These radios all come with a complete set of accessories and batteries, and can be used to listen to the radio without adding any additional accessories.
    The radios going to the countryside were warmly welcomed by the members. Many agricultural production cooperatives held general membership meetings, appointed dedicated personnel to manage the radios, and wrote letters thanking the Hebei People's Broadcasting Station for their concern. The Liu Wanzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanhe County wrote in a letter:
    "We will respond to the care and concern of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with the achievement of a comprehensive bumper harvest of cotton and grain in 1954." (Wu Yixin)

    河北人民广播电台赠送农业生产合作社收音机
    河北人民广播电台最近将二十八部四灯干电池式收音机送给全省二十八个重点农业生产合作社。这些收音机都附有全套的附件和电池，不用添加任何附件就可以收听广播。
    收音机下乡受到社员们热烈欢迎，许多农业生产合作社召开了全体社员大会，确定了管理收音机的专人，纷纷写信感谢河北人民广播电台对他们的关怀。三河县刘万祯农业生产合作社信中说：
  “我们要以一九五四年棉、粮全面丰收的成绩，来回答共产党和毛主席对我们的关怀。”（邬逸欣）
