    Random Notes from the Geneva Conference
    Wang Xi, Li Fengbai, Zheng Kui
    The Answer to a Question
    The Geneva Conference has entered its fourth week. In recent days, the people of France have unanimously voiced their call for an immediate end to the colonial war in Indochina. The French working class and other working people have been using their spare time to elect representatives to deliver appeals to the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, calling for the restoration of peace in Indochina, sometimes numbering dozens per day.
    In the offices of the Soviet and Chinese delegations, they naturally received satisfactory answers. At the office of the American delegation, it is said that they were either met with closed doors or rebuffed. As Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in his first speech at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue: "Many French people are asking: since a truce could be achieved in Korea, why can't a truce be achieved in Indochina? Since the Americans themselves accepted a truce in Korea, why don't they allow the French to accept a truce in Indochina?"
    No matter how the American imperialists evade and posture, the French people are increasingly aware of this issue concerning the interests of the French nation. For example, we heard several French trade union representatives say: the Korean War was mainly fought by the Americans, with American troops accounting for 90 percent of the "United Nations" forces. And the "dirty war" in Indochina? It is mainly the French expeditionary force that is fighting. According to Washington's wishful thinking, to expand the war in Indochina, in addition to apportioning cannon fodder from the proposed Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, the French people will at least be asked to make more sacrifices. The representatives of American monopoly capitalists say: "I have guns, you go fight." But the French people are determined not to do it. If French politicians can draw the correct conclusion from this, they will know how to choose between the two paths of peace and war facing France.
    They Fear History
    In the general discussions on the Korean and Indochina issues, it was clearly necessary for the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and China and the Soviet Union to briefly review the historical background and truth of both. Otherwise, right and wrong would not be distinguished, and truth and falsehood would be unclear. Dulles and later Smith and their ilk distorted historical facts, but they always opposed others talking about history, and they couldn't hold their heads up when they heard others talk about history. French Foreign Minister Bidault? He was the same. He didn't seem to care much when listening to Korean history, but when he heard about Vietnamese history, he was almost as restless as Dulles. Of course, some Western country representatives said:
  "Forget it, why talk about what has already passed, let's talk more about what to do today."
    Yes, it is necessary to talk more about what to do today, but today comes from yesterday. Wasn't it yesterday that Dulles instructed Syngman Rhee to invade North Korea and took the opportunity to forcibly occupy China's Taiwan as a base for attacking the Chinese mainland... that is why there is today's Korean issue? For example, on the Indochina issue, Smith and Bidault both said that the Bao Dai government was the only legitimate government of Vietnam, and that the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos were "ghosts"; but when illuminated by the mirror of history, one is reminded that "His Majesty" Bao Dai formally surrendered to Japan in September 1940, and on August 25, 1945, he announced his abdication, acknowledging that his twenty years of rule had brought no benefit to Vietnam, and swore to serve as an ordinary citizen loyal to the elected government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by Ho Chi Minh and recognized by France... At a press conference, someone asked the spokesman of the French delegation: "Where is Bao Dai now?" The spokesman was embarrassed to say. In fact, everyone here knows that he is continuing his life of pleasure and gambling in the Mediterranean? Isn't it still appropriate to say that Bao Dai is a "nightclub emperor" even now?
    An "Unexpected" Event
    On May 12, Bao Dai's representative, Nguyen Quoc Dinh, suddenly announced in Geneva the full text of two draft treaties of "independence" and "union" concocted between France and Bao Dai, although he stated that the two sides were negotiating the signing in Paris.
    The full text of these two draft treaties had not been signed, and it was not announced in Paris, the location of the talks, which surprised the reporters here and embarrassed some members of the French delegation. According to insiders, this was a trick played by US Undersecretary of State Smith, who wanted Nguyen Quoc Dinh to do this. When the news of this "unexpected" event reached Paris, it was during a fierce debate in the French parliament, when the Laniel cabinet was facing a life-or-death trial, which of course added a lot of trouble to Laniel.
    Smith's reason for instructing Nguyen Quoc Dinh in Geneva to violate convention and publish the full text of the unsigned draft treaties of "independence" and "union" was to echo Dulles's high-pitched tune in Washington that "the United States attaches great importance to the independence of the three Indochinese countries." Smith preemptively directed a play of "real independence" in order to create a "fait accompli" and drag the three regimes of Bao Dai in Indochina into the Southeast Asia defense group he was running around to cobble together, to block the road for the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina. French
  "News" reporter Madame Tabouis said in her report on this event:
  "In the future, Vietnam (referring to the Bao Dai regime) will be more dependent on the United States than on France." Indeed, the French warmongers who are willing to follow Dulles can only get such "rewards" from Washington.
    A Ridiculous Ban
    In the days before and after the Vietnamese People's Army liberated Dien Bien Phu, the French people's calls for an end to the war in Indochina were rising to an unprecedented height. Telegrams and letters of appeal for peace from all over France poured into the offices of the French delegation.
    Faced with such a huge wave, the American delegation and Bidault created many atmospheres in Geneva showing that they were eager to "run around" for peace, while some of America's buddies in Paris did not hesitate to take out the cheapest magic weapon, fantasizing about stirring up anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment.
    In the days after the recovery of Dien Bien Phu, Washington and Paris successively created a series of anti-Soviet "incidents." Among them, the most stupid and ridiculous should be the ban on performances by Soviet ballet dancers such as Ulanova in Paris.
    The performance date of the Soviet song and dance troupe, which was invited by the French government, was initially postponed due to the "fall" of Dien Bien Phu, and was eventually canceled indefinitely by the French government. The reason announced by the French authorities was to "prevent unexpected disturbances."
    The French government authorities may not have anticipated that this contrived ban did not create any hostility towards the Soviet Union among the French people, but instead caused greater dissatisfaction and resistance to the French government.
    According to a Paris report on May 10, although the radio repeatedly broadcast that the Soviet ballet had been ordered to stop performing, countless people still rushed to the theater to express their protest against the French government's ban. The Paris "Combat" newspaper said: "Despite the government's announcement of the cancellation, the queue for tickets is still very long, and more than 10,000 tickets have been pre-sold for the first five performances." And those viewers who were fortunate enough to have bought tickets and were forced to return them, their dissatisfaction can be imagined. The Paris "Volunteer Army News" commented on May 11: "The government's decision does not convince Parisians that the Soviet ballet should be held responsible for the Dien Bien Phu incident."
    The eyes of the people are discerning, and those who want to fool the people will only "lift a stone to drop it on their own feet." May 16

    日内瓦会议散记
    汪溪　李风白　郑揆
    一个问题的答案
    日内瓦会议已经进入第四周了。连日以来，法国各地人民一致发出了立即停止在印度支那所进行的殖民战争的呼声。法国工人阶级和其他劳动人民，更纷纷利用工余时间选举代表，到日内瓦来向中、苏、美、英、法五国的代表团递送恢复印度支那和平的呼吁书，有时日达数十起。
    在苏联和中国代表团的办公处，他们自然都得到了满意的答复。在美国代表团的办公处，听说他们不是吃到闭门羹，就是被斥退。正如周恩来外长在日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的第一次发言中所说的：“许多法国人都在问：既然在朝鲜能够停战，为什么在印度支那不能够停战呢？美国人自己既然在朝鲜接受停战，为什么又不容许法国人在印度支那接受停战呢？”
    不管美帝国主义者怎样回避和装腔作势，对于这个关系法兰西民族利益的问题是日益为法国人民所洞悉了的。例如，我们听到几个法国职工代表这样说：侵朝战争主要是美国人打的，在“联合国”军队中美国军队占了百分之九十。而印度支那的“肮脏战争”呢？主要是法国远征军在打。照华盛顿的如意算盘，要扩大印度支那的战争，除了从拟议中的东南亚侵略集团中摊派炮灰外，法国人民至少是要被要求作更多牺牲的。美国的垄断资本家们的代表们说：“我有枪，你们给我去打仗吧。”但法国人民是决心不干的。如果法国的政治家们能从这里找到了正确的结论，他们就会知道对于摆在法国面前的和与战的两条道路怎样加以选择了。
    他们害怕历史
    在朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的一般讨论中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和中、苏两国代表团的发言中，都扼要地回顾了一下两者的历史背景和真象，这显然是十分必要的。不然，就是非莫辨、真假不明了。杜勒斯和后来的史密斯之流，自己一味歪曲历史事实，可是又总是反对人家讲历史，听到人家谈历史他们就抬不起头来。法国外长皮杜尔呢？也是这样。他在听朝鲜历史时还似乎不大在乎，一听到越南的历史也几乎像杜勒斯那样坐立不安。当然也有一些西方国家代表这样说：
  “算了吧，已经过去了的事说它作什么，还是多谈谈今天怎样办罢。”
    是的，多谈今天怎样办是必需的，但今天是从昨天来的，不正是昨天杜勒斯们指使李承晚侵略了北朝鲜，并借机强占了中国的台湾作为进攻中国大陆的基地……才有今天这样的朝鲜问题吗？又例如，在印度支那问题上，史密斯和皮杜尔都说保大政府是越南唯一的合法政府，高棉和寮国的抗战政府都是“幽灵”；但经历史这面镜子一照，就会使人想起保大“陛下”是在一九四零年九月正式向日本投降的，一九四五年八月二十五日宣告退位，承认他统治的二十年来没有给越南带来一点好处，宣誓要作为一个普通公民而效忠于以胡志明为首的、经过选举产生而又为法国所承认了的越南民主共和国政府的……。在一次记者招待会上，有人问法国代表团发言人：“保大现在到底在那里？”发言人竟不好意思讲出。其实，这里的记者们谁不知道他是正在地中海上继续着他的声色赌博之乐呢？说保大是个“夜总会皇帝”，直到现在不是也还恰当吗？
    “意外”的事件
    五月十二日保大的代表阮国定，突然在日内瓦宣布了法国与保大之间加工泡制的“独立”和“联合”条约的两个草案全文，虽然他声明说双方正在巴黎谈判签字事宜。
    这两个草案全文既未经过签字，而且也不是在会谈地点巴黎公布，这不仅使此间的记者感到惊讶，也使法国代表团中一部分人十分尴尬。据知悉内幕的人透露：这是美国副国务卿史密斯搞的把戏，要阮国定这样干。当这个“意外”事件的消息传到巴黎时，正是法国议会进行激烈辩论、拉尼埃内阁受着生死审判的时候，当然这又给拉尼埃增添了不少烦恼。
    史密斯在日内瓦指使阮国定违背常例、公布未经签字的“独立”和“联合”条约草案全文的原因，是为的与日来杜勒斯在华盛顿高唱入云的“美国很重视印度支那三国的独立”的调子遥相呼应的。史密斯先发制人导演了一幕“真正的独立”的把戏，以便造成“既成的事实”，把印度支那保大等三个政权拉进他正在奔走拼凑的东南亚防务集团里去，来挡住日内瓦会议恢复印度支那和平的道路。法国
  “新闻报”记者塔布依夫人在报道这个事件时说：
  “今后越南（指保大政权）对美国的依赖将比对法国的依赖更多了”。诚然，甘愿作杜勒斯尾巴的法国主战派，只能从华盛顿得到这样的“报酬”的。
    可笑的禁令
    越南人民军解放奠边府的前后几天，法国人民要求停止印度支那战争的呼声正在空前高涨。从法国各地来的呼吁和平的请愿电报和函件，纷至沓来地到达法国代表团的办公室里。
    面对着这样巨大的浪潮，美国代表团和皮杜尔一面在日内瓦制造许多显示他们急于“奔走”和平的空气，一面在巴黎的一些美国的伙计们不惜拿出最不值钱的法宝，异想天开地企图煽起反苏反共的情绪。
    在奠边府收复之后的几天内，华盛顿和巴黎接二连三地制造了一连串的反苏“事件”。其中最愚蠢也是引起世人最大嘲笑的，应该说是禁止乌兰诺娃等苏联巴蕾舞演员在巴黎的演出了。
    应法国政府邀请的苏联歌舞团，原定在巴黎演出的日期，始而因奠边府“失陷”而缓期，终而被法国政府无限期地取消了。法国当局宣布的理由说是“防止意外骚动”。
    法国政府当局可能没有预料到这个故弄玄虚的禁令，并没有在法国人民中造成了任何对苏联的敌意，相反地却给法国政府惹致了更大的不满和反抗。
    据五月十日巴黎报载，虽然无线电一再广播苏联巴蕾舞已奉令停演，但仍有无数的人赶到戏院去，以表示对法国政府禁令的抗议。巴黎“战斗报”说：“尽管政府已宣布停演，但争购戏票者的队伍仍排得很长，预售的前五场戏票已有一万张以上。”而那些自幸已买到戏票的观众被迫不得不退票时，其不满情绪不问可知了。五月十一日巴黎“义勇军报”评论说：“政府的决定并不能使巴黎人相信苏联巴蕾舞应负奠边府事件的责任。”
    人民的眼睛是雪亮的，想愚弄人民的只有“搬起石头打自己的脚”的下场。　五月十六日
