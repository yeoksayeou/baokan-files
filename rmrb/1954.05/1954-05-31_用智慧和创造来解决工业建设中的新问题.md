Solving New Problems in Industrial Construction with Wisdom and Creativity
Song Tieshan, Model Worker of the Lumber Processing Plant, Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering

In the construction of the first automobile manufacturing plant in the motherland, we carpenters encountered a new problem: the hexagonal flooring required for the formal factory buildings. We had never made it, never seen it, and had only just heard of it for the first time.

Hexagonal flooring is different from ordinary flooring. Ordinary flooring is laid flat; you just need to saw the wood along the grain into floorboards, and if the surface isn't flat, you plane it. Hexagonal flooring must be laid upright, so you have to saw across the grain, and you can’t plane it if the surface isn't flat. The annual demand for hexagonal flooring was also very high.

Based on the above requirements, the key problem was to cut the hexagonal flooring quickly and to have a flat cut surface.

The carpentry workshop did not have the equipment to produce hexagonal flooring. At the time, everyone believed that cross-cutting wood could only be done with a swing cut-off saw. The production volume of swing cut-off saws is very small. According to calculations, to produce the annual requirement of hexagonal flooring, twenty-two swing cut-off saws and more than sixty people would be needed, and they would have to work all year round without a break to complete the task. We only had two swing cut-off saws at the time, and the rest of the saw blades had to be bought from abroad. After buying them, we would have to build more factory buildings and recruit and train workers. This would require a lot of money and a long time. The result would inevitably affect the completion of the first automobile manufacturing plant's formal factory buildings. This path was impossible to take.

We set about trying to break through the idea that "only swing cut-off saws can cross-cut wood." The result of experimenting with a large piece of wood on a band saw was that the band saw could cut very high-quality wood across the grain. From here, we began to find a glimmer of a solution.

If a band saw could only cut one piece of hexagonal flooring at a time, it would be as incapable of meeting the needs of factory construction as a swing cut-off saw. How to make a large band saw cut many pieces of hexagonal flooring simultaneously became the only question in my mind at the time. I imagined that there should be a carriage next to the band saw, which could hold many pieces of hexagonal wood at once. The wood should be absolutely stable and pushed by a leadscrew. This way, many pieces of wood could be sent to the band saw together, and many high-quality pieces of hexagonal flooring could be cut at once. I thought this was feasible.

I am just a fourth-grade carpenter and don't understand mechanical principles and can't draw diagrams. I went to the workshop statistician, Comrade Zheng Ben (who also didn't know much about mechanical principles), to help me draw a diagram. He helped me enthusiastically and bravely, and we drew a rough sketch in our spare time. When this rough sketch was seen by "experts," they said that it was a "wishful thinking diagram" (meaning that I drew it as I imagined it, and it didn't conform to mechanical principles) and couldn't be used. I asked him to help me turn the "wishful thinking diagram" into a "practical diagram," and he said:

  "Please find someone else." Our work section chief also said, "You're dreaming of marrying a wife; there's no such good thing!"

But the factory and company leaders supported me, and more technicians helped me, such as Comrades Ren Changwen, He Xiling, Liang Zhongkai, and an old technician from the East China Iron and Steel Plant all gave me a lot of help. I also studied mechanical drawing. In seventy-three days, after repeated research and several revisions, I finally created a "Hexagonal Flooring Carriage." According to the results of the experiment, one "Hexagonal Flooring Carriage" is fifteen point six times more productive than a circular saw. According to calculations, it can save the country more than 600 million yuan in capital in the production of hexagonal flooring. Using this carriage for three shifts a day, the task can be completed in one hundred and eighty days. Such a carriage can be used in all carpentry production that requires cross-cutting wood.

In our country's many important basic constructions, many new problems that we have never heard of, never seen, and never even thought of will surely arise. Our working class must, with the attitude of masters of the country, study diligently and give full play to our creative talents to solve these problems. After creating the "Hexagonal Flooring Carriage," I am now researching the skateboard two-wheel electric saw. The comrades in our company's mechanized supply station are researching the creation of a deep pit excavator (which is also something never seen before). All of these are to solve new problems in factory construction.

We have the support of the Communist Party and administrative leaders, which provides us with guaranteed conditions for technological innovation and invention. Every member of our basic construction should have and maintain this spirit: use their own wisdom and creative talents to solve the new problems that arise in basic construction, in order to promote the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

    用智慧和创造来解决工业建设中的新问题
    中央建筑工程部直属工程公司木材加工厂劳动模范　宋铁珊
    在建设祖国第一个汽车制造厂中，我们木工们遇到了一个新问题：正式厂房需要的六角地板，我们既没做过，也没见过，还是头一次听说。
    六角地板和普通地板不同。普通地板是平铺，只要用锯顺着木楂解成楼板，面不平用刨子刨平就行；六角地板要立着铺，截这种地板要用锯横着木楂截，面不平还用不得刨子。六角地板全年需要量也很多。
    根据上述要求，关键问题在于六角地板要截断的快，截断面要平。
    木工车间没有生产六角地板的设备。当时大家都认为：截横木只能用吊截锯。吊截锯的生产量是很小的。根据计算：生产全年需要的六角地板，要有二十二台吊截锯，六十多个人，还要全年都不休假才能完成任务。而我们当时只有两台吊截锯，其余的吊截锯片只能到国外去买，买回来了还要增建厂房；要招收训练工人。这需要大量的钱和很长的时间。结果必然要影响到第一汽车制造厂正式厂房的完工。这条路无论如何是不能走的。
    我们在设法突破“只有吊截锯能截横木”的看法。用一块大木头在带子锯上试验的结果，带子锯能截出质量很好的横木。从这里我们开始找到了一线出路。
    如果带子锯一次只能截一块六角地板的话，它将会像吊截锯一样的不能满足建厂的需要。如何使一大条带子锯，一次同时能截下许多块六角地板来，便成了当时我思想中的唯一问题。我设想：带子锯旁应该有一个跑车，跑车上一次能卡上许多六角木材，木材应该绝对稳当，需要一条丝杠来推动，这样把许多木材，一起送到带子锯前，一次便可截下许多质量很好的六角地板来。我认为这是可行的。
    我只是一个四级木工，不懂得机械原理，画不了图。我便去找车间统计员郑本同志（他也不大懂机械原理）帮我画图。他热情而勇敢地帮助了我，我们便在业余时间，画成了一份草图。这份草图经“内行”人一看就说，你这是“心思图”（意思是说我怎样想就怎样画了，不合机械原理），用不得。我请他帮我把“心思图”变成“实际图”，他说：
  “你另请高明吧。”我们的工段长也说：“你做梦娶媳妇，那有那么好的事？”
    但厂和公司的领导上支持了我，有更多的技术人员帮助了我，如任长文、何希令、梁忠凯等同志和华东钢铁厂的一个老技术工人都给了我不少帮助，我还研读了机械制图学，在七十三天中，经过反复研究，数次修改。终于制成了一部“六角地板跑车”。根据试验的结果，一台“六角地板跑车”，要比一台圆锯的生产效率高十五点六倍。计算下来，可以在六角地板的生产中，给国家节省六亿多元的资财。用这个跑车日开三班，一百八十天就可完成任务。这样的跑车在所有截横木的木工生产中都能使用。
    在我国许多重要的基本建设中，一定会出现许多我们过去没听过，没见过，连想也没想到过的新问题。我们工人阶级必须以国家主人翁的态度，刻苦钻研，发挥创造才能来解决这些问题。我在创造了“六角地板跑车”以后，现在又正在研究滑铁两轮电动锯。我们公司机械化供应站的同志，正在研究要创造一部深坑挖土机（这也是从来没见过的事），这些都是为了解决建厂中的新问题的。
    我们有共产党和行政领导的支持，这给了我们技术革新发明创造以保证条件。我们参加基本建设的每一分子，都应该具有和保持这种精神：用自己的智慧和创造才能，解决基本建设中出现的新问题，来促进祖国的社会主义工业化。
