Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 10th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 10th, expressing full support for the proposal made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the 3rd at the Geneva Conference regarding the issue of prisoners of war. Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal is that measures must be taken to ensure that North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained and enlisted into the army in June 1953 and January 1954 are able to return to their homeland.

The commentary pointed out that it is extremely appropriate for the Geneva Conference, convened to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, to take necessary measures to reasonably resolve this issue, which has not been resolved due to the American side's violation of the armistice agreement.

The commentary stated: The Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that prisoners of war must be treated in a humanitarian spirit, and after the cessation of hostilities, prisoners of war should be released and repatriated without delay. However, the American side blatantly disregarded international conventions and used various barbaric means to forcibly detain North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and massacred a large number of prisoners of war. More than 33,600 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army were brutally murdered by American butchers alone. Only ten days after the signing of the agreement reached through the efforts of the North Korean and Chinese sides to ensure that every prisoner of war had the opportunity to exercise the right to be repatriated, the American side violated this agreement and connived with the Li Seung-man gang to forcibly detain more than 27,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. At that time, the American side made a promise to the North Korean and Chinese sides that it was "continuing to work to recover the escaped prisoners of war," but it was never fulfilled. Subsequently, the American side tried every means to obstruct the North Korean and Chinese sides' explanation work to the prisoners of war, and on January 20 and 21, 1954, detained more than 21,900 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were originally under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and forcibly enlisted them into the armies of Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek. More than 600 prisoners of war who escaped the threat of atrocities by American agents and returned to the embrace of their motherland have unanimously exposed the lies of the so-called "anti-communist prisoners of war" manufactured by the American side using cruel methods such as massacre and torture. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also confirmed this fact in its "Final Report" and other documents.

The commentary pointed out that ensuring that North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained and enlisted into the army by the American side can return to their homeland as soon as possible to live a peaceful and happy life is one of the important issues that is inseparable from the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The people of North Korea and China, together with all the good people in the world, firmly advocate that the Geneva Conference should reasonably resolve this issue while discussing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    支持周恩来外长关于战俘问题的建议
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜中央通讯社十日发表评论，表示完全支持周恩来外长三日在日内瓦会议上就战俘问题所提出的建议。周外长的建议是，必须采取措施，保证一九五三年六月和一九五四年一月被强迫扣留并编入军队的朝中被俘人员得以重返祖国。
    评论指出：为和平解决朝鲜问题而召开的日内瓦会议，对由于美方违反停战协定而未能解决的这一问题，采取必要措施加以合理解决，是极其应当的。
    评论说：日内瓦公约明白规定，必须以人道主义的精神对待战俘，在敌对行为终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。但是，美方公然漠视国际公约，为了强迫扣留朝中被俘人员而使用各种野蛮手段，并大量屠杀战俘。仅朝鲜人民军被俘人员惨遭美国屠夫杀害的就在三万三千六百名以上。在朝中方面努力下达成的关于保证每一战俘有机会行使被遣返权利的协议签字后不过十天，美方就破坏了这个协议，纵容李承晚匪帮强迫扣留了二万七千多名朝中战俘。当时，美方曾向朝中方面作了“正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘”的诺言，但一直没有履行。以后，美方又千方百计地阻挠朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，并在一九五四年一月二十日和二十一日，扣留了原在中立国遣返委员会看管下的二万一千九百多名朝中被俘人员，把他们强迫编入了李承晚和蒋介石的军队。不顾美方特务暴行的威胁逃回祖国怀抱的六百多名被俘人员，已一致揭露了美方用屠杀和拷打等残酷手段制造的所谓“反共战俘”的谎话，中立国遣返委员会也在它的“最后报告”和其他文件中证实了这个事实。
    评论指出：保证被美方强迫扣留并编入军队的朝中被俘人员早日回到祖国过和平幸福生活，是与和平解决朝鲜问题分不开的重要问题之一。朝中两国人民和全世界善良人们一起，坚决主张日内瓦会议在讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的同时，应该合理解决这个问题。
