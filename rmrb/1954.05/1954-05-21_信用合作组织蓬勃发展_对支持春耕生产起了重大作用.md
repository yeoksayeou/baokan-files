Credit Cooperatives Flourish
    Playing a Significant Role in Supporting Spring Ploughing Production

[Report from this newspaper] Rural credit mutual aid cooperative organizations nationwide have seen new development this year, playing a significant role in supporting spring ploughing production. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 26,416 credit cooperatives, 23,867 credit mutual aid groups, and 3,608 credit departments set up in supply and marketing cooperatives across the country. Among them, the number of credit cooperatives has increased by 1.8 times compared to the end of last year.

After being educated on the general task of the state during the transition period, farmers in various regions have greatly increased their enthusiasm for participating in credit mutual aid cooperative organizations. Especially after selling large quantities of surplus grain, many regions' farmers have requested that their local people's governments help establish and improve their own "small banks" in order to save temporarily unused money and invest it in production in a planned way. Communist Party committees, people's governments, and the People's Bank of China in various regions have actively led the work of establishing and consolidating credit mutual aid cooperative organizations. According to incomplete statistics from the Northwest region, 220 credit cooperatives and 516 credit mutual aid groups were newly established in the first quarter of this year. Currently, Hubei Province has an average of one credit cooperative for every 2.85 townships, Shanxi Province has an average of one credit cooperative or credit department for every 1.62 townships, and Ping Le County in Guangxi Province has achieved one credit cooperative per township. In order to cultivate backbone personnel and consolidate and develop credit mutual aid cooperative organizations, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces have trained approximately 16,700 rural credit cooperative cadres this spring; 28 counties in Guangxi Province have centrally trained credit cooperative cadres.

During the spring ploughing production period, these newly established and existing credit mutual aid cooperative organizations, in coordination with the state bank's agricultural loan distribution work, actively carried out credit business. In addition to distributing a batch of agricultural loans on behalf of the state bank, credit mutual aid cooperative organizations in various regions also issued a large number of loans themselves. In the first quarter of this year, credit mutual aid cooperative organizations in the North China region issued loans worth more than 170.8 billion yuan; according to statistics from 115 credit cooperatives in 21 counties and 340 credit departments in 23 counties in Jilin Province, a total of approximately 13.3 billion yuan in loans were issued. Credit cooperatives in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, absorbed 27.6 billion yuan in funds and had issued 10.5 billion yuan in loans by the end of March, equivalent to 152 percent of the state bank's agricultural loan distribution in the same period in the prefecture. According to statistics from 614 credit cooperatives in the prefecture, the loans they issued have helped farmers purchase more than 4,100 draught animals, more than 730 carts, 3 waterwheels, and 48 walking plows, as well as a large number of other agricultural tools, fertilizers, and other means of production. In addition, they also helped farmers dig 7 wells and repair a batch of carts, waterwheels, and wells. This year, credit mutual aid cooperative organizations in many townships in western Liaoning and Hunan provinces have also adopted methods that facilitate farmers, such as setting up service points in various villages and holding regular mobile offices in various villages, to carry out credit business. Many farmers said, "With our own 'small banks,' it is convenient to deposit and borrow money, we are no longer subject to usurious exploitation, and it is easier to solve difficulties in production!"

    信用合作组织蓬勃发展
    对支持春耕生产起了重大作用
    【本报讯】全国农村的信用互助合作组织今年有新的发展，对支持春耕生产起了重大作用。据不完全统计，目前全国已有信用合作社二万六千四百一十六个、信用互助组二万三千八百六十七个，设在供销合作社的信用部有三千六百零八个。其中信用合作社比去年年底增加了一点八倍。
    各地农民受到国家过渡时期总任务的教育以后，参加信用互助合作组织的积极性大为提高。特别是在出售大批余粮以后，许多地区的农民都要求当地人民政府帮助建立和健全自己的“小银行”，以便把暂时不用的钱储蓄起来，有计划地投入生产。各地中共党委、人民政府及人民银行都积极领导了建立和整顿信用互助合作组织的工作。西北区据不完全统计，在今年第一季度即领导新建了二百二十个信用合作社、五百一十六个信用互助组。目前，湖北省平均每二点八五个乡有一个信用合作社，山西省平均每一点六二个乡有一个信用合作社或信用部，广西省平乐县已达到每乡有一个信用合作社。为了培养骨干，巩固和发展信用互助合作组织，河南、江西、湖北、山西等四省已在今年春季训练了农村信用合作干部约一万六千七百名；广西省有二十八个县集中训练了信用合作干部。
    这些新建和原有的信用互助合作组织在春耕生产期间，配合国家银行发放农业贷款的工作，积极开展了信贷业务。各地信用互助合作组织除代国家银行发放一批农业贷款外，自己也发放了大批贷款。今年第一季度，华北区信用互助合作组织发放贷款一千七百零八亿余元；吉林省据二十一个县的一百一十五个信用合作社和二十三个县的三百四十个信用部的统计，共发放贷款约一百三十三亿元。山西省运城专区的信用合作社吸收资金二百七十六亿元，到三月底已发放贷款一百零五亿元，相当于国家银行同一时期在该专区发放农贷数字的百分之一百五十二。据该专区六百一十四个信用合作社的统计，它们发放的贷款已帮助农民购买耕畜四千一百多头、大车七百三十多辆、水车三部、步犁四十八张，以及大批其他的农具、肥料等生产资料，另外还帮助农民打了七口水井，修理了一批大车、水车和水井。辽西、湖南等省许多乡的信用互助合作组织今年还采用在各村设立服务点、到各村定期流动办公等便利农民的办法，开展信贷业务。许多农民说：“有了咱们自己的‘小银行’，存钱、贷款都方便，再也不受高利贷剥削，生产中有困难也容易解决了！”
