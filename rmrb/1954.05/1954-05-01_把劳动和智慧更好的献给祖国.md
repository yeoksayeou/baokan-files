    Dedicate Labor and Wisdom to the Motherland Even Better
    Zhu Shunyu, Shanghai Hardware Industry Labor Model
    I was originally a planer at the Shanghai Turbine Factory, and now I have been promoted to deputy section chief of the blade workshop in the trial manufacturing department. In the past two years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have created and improved 24 tools, increasing production efficiency by one to eighteen times. In the past year alone, the amount of work I did, calculated according to the production quota at that time, was equivalent to two years and four months of work. In the production process, I have never had any defective products, work-related injuries, or equipment accidents.

    To achieve technological innovation, the most important thing is to learn in many ways, including learning from others and from magazines and newspapers. Because any technological innovation, especially more complex technological innovation, cannot be accomplished by one person's strength alone. I usually pay close attention to the work of others, especially the master workers. When I see that his lathe works quickly and smoothly, I have to study what methods he has. My use of the multi-tool and multi-blade method on the planer came about in this way.

    In 1952, I was assigned to make parts for the Huaihe River闸门(sluice gate). This task was very urgent, and everyone wanted to complete it as soon as possible to support the Huaihe River harnessing project. At that time, I saw others using the Soviet advanced experience of multi-tool and multi-blade cutting on lathes, which greatly improved efficiency. I thought that if my planer and gantry planer also used the multi-tool and multi-blade method, production would definitely be improved. Some people thought that the multi-tool and multi-blade method could not be used on planers, but according to the cutting principle of multi-tool and multi-blade lathes, I modified some equipment and used it on the planer. The result was very good, and the efficiency increased by one to two times, allowing the task to be completed ahead of schedule.

    Technological innovation is not a matter of a day or two; it is most important to pay attention in many ways at ordinary times. I usually carry a small notebook in my pocket. Whenever I encounter difficulties and areas that need improvement in production, or when I see something and have some experience, I always write it down in the notebook, or draw sketches and marks. Whenever I have free time, I study ways to improve production technology based on these records. In addition to storing tools, my toolbox often contains many materials that I usually pick up to improve tools, and I often use these materials to conduct research and experiments.

    Technological innovation should not only focus on personal achievements, but also help and organize everyone to do it together, so that everyone can be improved and production can be developed. Old workers should especially help other workers. Therefore, when I see others encountering difficulties in production, I must step in to help. Several of my technological innovations were made by helping others. For example, in August last year, our factory trial-produced the blades for China's first turbine. The blades required high precision and were difficult to make, the quality was low, and there were many defective products. Only 40 pieces could be made a day (the quota was 160 pieces a day). The two comrades who made the blades were very anxious, and some even refused to do it. Although I was not making blades at the time, I was also anxious when I saw it, and felt that I could not stand idly by. I discussed with the technician and designed a tool for making blades. Later, I continued to work hard to research and improve it, and finally increased the efficiency of the blades to more than 720 pieces a day, an increase of 17 times, and the quality was also guaranteed. The apprentices who worked with me have made rapid progress in technology. For example, apprentice Wang Fengxiu came only in January last year, and now he has become an excellent worker in the factory with high output and good quality. In my original group, many people have improved their technology and exceeded the quota.

    This time I came to Beijing to visit the Anshan Iron and Steel Group's technological innovation exhibition, which helped me a lot. I have already made a plan to change the steam passage process of blade manufacturing in our factory to mechanization after I go back. I am very happy to be able to participate in the "May 1st" festival in the capital. I am determined to further improve technology and dedicate labor and wisdom to the motherland even better.

    把劳动和智慧更好的献给祖国
    上海五金工业劳动模范　朱顺馀
    我原来是上海汽轮机厂的刨工，现在被提拔为试造车间叶片工段的副段长。两年来我在党的培养教育下，共创造和改进了工具二十四件，提高生产效率一倍到十八倍。在去年一年中我所做的活，如按当时的生产定额算，共完成了相等于两年零四个月的工作量。在生产过程中，我从来没有出过废品和工伤、设备事故。
    要实现技术革新，最要紧的是一定要多方面的学习，其中包括向别人学习，从杂志报章上学习等等。因为任何技术革新，特别是较复杂的技术革新，决不是一个人的力量能完成的。我在平时非常注意别人、尤其是老师傅的工作情形，看到他的车床做活又快又顺手，我就得去研究一下他有些什么方法。我在刨床上使用多刀多刃法就是这样得来的。
    一九五二年我被分配做淮河闸门上的零件，这批任务很急，大家都想早些完成好支援治淮工程，当时我看到别人在车床上用苏联先进经验多刀多刃切削法，效率提高很多，我想我的刨床和龙门刨床如也用多刀多刃法，生产一定也能提高。曾有些人认为刨床上是没法用多刀多刃法的，但我根据车床多刀多刃的切削原理，改了一些装备，在刨床上也用了起来，结果很好，效率提高一倍到二倍，使任务提前完成。
    技术革新不是一朝一夕的功夫，平时多方留意是最重要的。我的口袋里平常总装着一个小本子，在生产中一碰到困难和需要改进的地方，或者自己看到什么有了点体会，都随时把它记在本子上，或画上草图和记号，遇有空闲就根据这些记录研究改进生产技术的办法。我的工具箱里除了储存工具以外，常常放着许多平时拣来的改进工具的材料，我就常常利用这些材料来进行研究和试验。
    技术革新也不能只注意个人的成就，还得要帮助和组织大家都干，才能把大家都提高并且使生产发展起来。老工人尤其应当帮助别的工人。因此我看到别人生产上遇了难事，就一定要插上去帮忙。我在技术革新上有好几项都是帮助别人做出来的。譬如去年八月我厂试造中国第一部汽轮机的叶片，叶片精密度要求高，不好做，质量低，废品多，一天只能做四十只（定额一天要一百六十只），做叶片的两个同志急得要命，有的人甚至不肯干了。我当时虽然不是做叶片的，看了也着急，感到自己不能袖手旁观，便和技术员研究设计了一个做叶片的工具，以后我又继续用心研究改进，终于使叶片的效率提高到一天做七百二十多只，提高十七倍，质量也有了保证。和我一起工作的徒工，技术上进步都很快，譬如徒工王凤秀是去年一月才来的，现在已成了厂里产量高、质量好的优秀工人。在我原来的小组里，许多人都改进了技术，突破了定额。
    这次我来北京参观了鞍钢的技术革新展览会，对我帮助很大。我已订了一个计划，准备回去后把我厂叶片制造的汽道工序改为机械化。我能在首都参加“五一”节，这使我非常高兴。我决心进一步的改进技术，把劳动和智慧更好的献给祖国。
