    Shenyang Municipal Workers Actively Participate in Voluntary Labor
    Shanghai Youth Enthusiastically Participate in the Construction of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building
    The Shenyang Municipal People's Government formed a Voluntary Labor Management Committee on April 14th. All units of the Shenyang Military Region, factories, mines, institutions, and schools enthusiastically responded to the Committee's call to participate in the municipal construction of the new Shenyang during their spare time. The Northeast Military Region held a cadre mobilization meeting on the 9th of this month, resolutely responding to the call of the local government and actively participating in voluntary labor. Workers in the machinery and light industries systems, and the Northeast Textile Administration are now enthusiastically signing up to participate in voluntary labor. More than one hundred employees of the Shenhe District People's Government have already signed up for voluntary labor. They believe that it is a great honor to be able to build the new Shenyang with their own hands, brick by brick. The Voluntary Labor Management Committee has decided to conduct a pilot project in the Tiexi Workers' District on the 12th (road construction), and starting from the 15th, it will dispatch a voluntary labor force of over a thousand people every day to carry out city-wide voluntary construction (including asphalt roads, canal widening, and pipeline projects).

    Youth from all walks of life in Shanghai are enthusiastically participating in voluntary labor for the construction of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. Since the commencement of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building construction project on May 4th, more than 6,000 young members of the Communist Youth League and other young people from Shanghai's institutions, factories, schools, and shops have participated in voluntary labor for this project. Some used factory rest days, and others used Sunday holidays. Although they each only worked for two and a half hours at a time, they have made great achievements. According to preliminary estimates, by May 9th, in just five days, they had moved over 500 cubic meters of earth, cleaned over 50,000 kilograms of steel bars, and moved over 10,000 bricks. In addition, they did a lot of work such as lifting steel bars, moving yellow sand, lifting gravel, and carrying wood. Voluntary labor not only trained themselves, but also encouraged the workers who were responsible for the construction of this project. On the evening of May 8th, many workers, upon hearing the news that young people would participate in voluntary labor the next day, used their work breaks to write letters to the young people participating in voluntary labor, thanking them and making promises to do a good job.

    沈阳市职工积极参加义务劳动
    上海青年踊跃参加建筑中苏友好大厦
    沈阳市人民政府于四月十四日组成义务劳动管理委员会。沈阳市各部队、厂矿、机关和学校热烈响应该委员会的号召，利用业余时间参加新沈阳的市政建设。东北军区于本月九日召开了干部动员会，坚决响应地方政府的号召，积极参加义务劳动。机械、轻工业系统，东北纺织管理局的职工们，现正踊跃报名参加义务劳动。沈河区人民政府已有一百多名职工报名参加义务劳动。他们认为能用自己的双手为祖国的新沈阳的城市建设砌上一砖一石，那也是很光荣的。现义务劳动管理委员会决定于十二日在铁西工人区进行试点（修筑马路），从十五日起，每日将调配千余人的义务劳动大军，开展全市性的义务建设（包括柏油马路、运河加宽和管道工程等）。（东北记者站）
    上海各界青年踊跃参加上海中苏友好大厦建设工程义务劳动。自五月四日上海中苏友好大厦建筑工程开工以来，上海各机关、工厂、学校、商店青年团员和青年已有六千多人参加这项工程的义务劳动。他们有的利用工厂休息日，有的利用星期日例假，虽然他们每人每次只作两个半小时的劳动，但已做出了很大成绩，据初步估计：到五月九日止，仅仅五天时间，他们已挑土方五百余方，擦钢筋五万余公斤，搬砖一万余块。另外并作了许多抬钢筋、搬黄沙、抬石子、扛木料等工作。义务劳动不只锻炼了他们自己，也鼓舞了担任这项工程建筑的工人，在五月八日晚上，很多工人听到第二天将有青年参加义务劳动的消息，就利用工休时间给参加义务劳动的青年们写信，向他们致谢，并提出做好工作的保证。
