    Anhui Province Basically Completes Pre-purchase Work for Wheat, Rapeseed, and Tea
    The supply and marketing cooperatives in Anhui Province concluded their pre-purchase work of wheat and rapeseed from farmers in early May. According to statistics from 43 townships, farmers pre-sold more than 7,670,000 catties of wheat and more than 1,160,000 catties of rapeseed to the state. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places accepted particularly large quantities of state pre-purchases. For example, the Houlou Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the suburbs of Bengbu City in the wheat-producing area signed a pre-purchase contract with the state for more than 27,200 catties of wheat.
    The state paid Anhui Province farmers a total of 200 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits for wheat and rapeseed, which greatly helped farmers' production and lives. After receiving more than 10 million yuan in deposits, farmers in Nankou Township, Chengguan District, Tongcheng County, used the money to repair more than 20 pieces of farm tools and purchased rice seeds, fertilizers, etc. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    The tea pre-purchase work in Anhui Province has basically ended. Tea farmers across the province have received nearly 15 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits from the state, and their production enthusiasm is very high.
    Before the tea season, when tea farmers need more production funds and living expenses, this year, after the state launched the tea pre-purchase work, tea farmers actively pre-sold their tea to the state. In Huizhou Prefecture, which produces a large amount of tea for export, more than 8,000 households pre-sold more than 2 million catties of tea to the state. Farmers in Qimen, Xiuning, and Ningguo counties received more than 3.3 billion yuan in deposits after pre-selling tea. After receiving the pre-purchase deposits, tea farmers in various places actively added tea-making tools. After receiving the deposit, the Xiongyuan Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Hecheng Township, Xiuning County, purchased 21 tea pots and many farm tools from the supply and marketing cooperative. The turnover of production materials in the Dong'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ningguo County doubled after the tea pre-purchase work was launched; farmers in Jichuan and Jixi townships in the county ordered 137 tea pots from the supply and marketing cooperative. Farmers in tea areas such as Qimen also pooled the deposits to install hydraulic tea rolling machines.
    At present, tea farmers in various places are actively selling good tea to the state in accordance with the pre-purchase contract. According to statistics from seven tea collection stations in Shencun and Honglin, Xuancheng County, from April 21st to 24th, tea farmers sold more than 23,900 catties of tea to the state.

    安徽省预购小麦菜籽和茶叶的工作基本结束
    安徽省各地供销合作社向农民预购小麦和菜籽的工作在五月初结束了。据四十三个乡的统计，农民预售给国家的小麦有七百六十七万多斤，菜籽一百十六万多斤。各地农业生产合作社接受国家预购的数量特别大，小麦产区的蚌埠市郊区后楼农业生产合作社，就和国家订了二万七千二百多斤小麦的预购合同。
    国家共付给安徽省农民的小麦、菜籽预购定金达二千亿元，这对农民的生产和生活帮助很大。桐城县城关区南口乡农民得到一千多万元定金后，把这笔钱修理了二十多件农具，并买了稻种、肥料等。（据新华社讯）
    安徽省的茶叶预购工作已经基本结束。全省各地茶农得到国家将近一百五十亿元的预购定金，生产情绪很高。
    茶汛前夕，正是茶农需要较多的生产资金和生活费用的时候，今年国家展开茶叶预购工作以后，茶农们纷纷把茶叶预售给国家。大量出产外销茶的徽州专区，有八千多户农民预售给国家二百多万斤茶叶。祁门、休宁、宁国三县农民预售茶叶后，即得到三十三亿余万元定金。各地茶农得到预购定金以后，都积极添置制茶工具。休宁县鹤城乡雄沅村农业生产合作社领到定金后，从供销合作社买了二十一口茶锅和许多农具。宁国县东岸供销合作社的生产资料营业额，在茶叶预购工作展开以后增加了一倍；该县济川、济西两个乡的农民，就向供销合作社订购了一百三十七口茶锅。祁门等地茶区的农民还将定金凑集起来，装置了水力揉茶机。
    目前，各地茶农正按照预购合同，积极把好茶卖给国家。据宣城县沈村、洪林等七个收茶站的统计，从四月二十一日到二十四日，茶农卖给国家的茶叶即有二万三千九百多斤。
