    Theoretical Study Center Group of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau
    Convenes Special Meeting to Study Thematic Papers
    At the start of the general line study, the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau designated thirty leading comrades at the regional level to conduct thematic research on twenty-six issues related to the general line. Currently, a total of 303 comrades from the Northwest Bureau, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xi'an provincial and municipal committees are participating in thematic research, and 80 of them have submitted thematic papers. Among the thirty comrades designated by the Northwest Bureau, twenty-three have submitted thematic research papers.
    In order to study and process these papers, the Theoretical Study Center Group of the Northwest Bureau convened a special meeting on March 3 to discuss them. At the meeting, the papers written by ten comrades, including Ma Xiwu, Chang Lifu, Zhao Shouyi, Yu Jie, Li Qiming, Qiao Peixin, Chen Yuanfang, Su Fen, Su Yiping, and Li Huiyou, were discussed. The strengths and weaknesses of each paper were studied, and opinions on how to handle them were exchanged. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Ma Mingfang, Third Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, gave the following instructions on the principles for handling thematic papers: Papers that are both theoretical and practical, and relatively mature, may be published in newspapers, periodicals, or internal party communications, and the authors may be organized to give special reports to cadres; papers that are basically correct but have some shortcomings may be organized for the authors to give special reports to cadres, and the authors should be required to repeatedly study and revise them in the process of reporting, and then publish them in newspapers and periodicals after they have been revised and improved; papers that are not yet mature should be required to continue research until they reach the standards of the first two types of papers, and then be handled according to the above methods.
  The Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau, based on Comrade Ma Mingfang's instructions, formulated "Measures for Handling Thematic Research Papers and Notes/Reports of Senior Groups." The regulations stipulate that thematic research papers or notes/reports written by regional responsible comrades designated by the Northwest Bureau, and secretaries and deputy secretaries of provincial and municipal committees, and chairmen and vice-chairmen of provincial people's governments, and mayors and deputy mayors of municipal people's governments, should be studied in detail by the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau, which will then propose handling opinions and submit them to the Theoretical Study Center Group of the Northwest Bureau for approval. The thematic research papers arranged by the provincial and municipal committees should generally be studied by the propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal committees, which will draft handling opinions and submit them to the theoretical study center groups of the provincial and municipal committees for handling. However, the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau should also review the papers of responsible comrades of the provincial and municipal committees, as well as the notes, insights, reports, and papers submitted by general senior group comrades of the provinces and cities to the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau, whenever possible, select the better ones for public publication, and raise consultation opinions to the authors on those with serious errors. This handling method particularly emphasizes that the handling of thematic research papers, notes, insights, and reports should adopt the method of more encouragement and more help in order to enhance everyone's enthusiasm and confidence in learning. However, for those with serious errors in their viewpoints, they should also be promptly raised and repeatedly discussed in order to clarify thinking and improve understanding.
    As of now, the Theoretical Study Center Group of the Northwest Bureau has discussed and processed nineteen thematic research papers, and the Theoretical Study Center Group of the Xi'an Municipal Committee has also held meetings to discuss and process thematic research papers. The Propaganda Departments of the Northwest Bureau and the Northwest provinces and cities party committees are stepping up urging those comrades who have not yet completed their thematic research papers to do so.

    中共中央西北局理论学习中心小组
    召开专门会议研究专题论文
    中共中央西北局在总路线学习开始时，指定大区一级三十位负责同志分别就有关总路线的二十六个问题进行专题研究。目前，西北局，陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏和西安等省、市委参加专题研究的同志共三百零三人，已有八十人交了专题论文。西北局指定的三十位同志中，已有二十三人交了专题研究论文。
    为了研究和处理这些论文，西北局理论学习中心小组曾于三月三日召开专门会议讨论。会上对马锡五、常黎夫、赵守一、喻杰、李启明、乔培新、陈元方、苏奋、苏一萍、李会友等十位同志写好的论文进行了讨论，研究了各篇论文的优缺点并交换了分别处理的意见。会议结束时，西北局第三书记马明方同志对专题论文处理的原则作了如下指示：凡是有理论有实际的、比较成熟的论文，可分别在报纸刊物上或党内通讯上发表，并可组织作者向干部作专题报告；凡是基本上没有错误，但还有若干缺点的论文，可先组织作者向干部作专题报告，并要求作者在报告过程中反复研究，加以修改，俟修改完善后，再在报刊上发表；凡是尚不成熟的论文，则应要求作者继续进行研究，俟达到前两类论文的标准时，再按上述办法处理。
  西北局宣传部根据马明方同志的指示，拟定了“关于处理专题研究论文和高级组的笔记报告的办法”。规定西北局指定的大区负责同志和各省、市委书记、副书记和省人民政府主席、副主席和市人民政府市长、副市长所写的专题研究论文或笔记报告，由西北局宣传部详细研究后提出处理意见，交西北局理论学习中心小组审批。各省、市委所布置的专题研究论文，一般由省、市委宣传部加以研究并草拟处理意见，提交省、市委理论学习中心小组处理。但西北局宣传部对各省、市委负责同志的论文以及各省、市一般高级组同志送交西北局宣传部的笔记、心得、报告、论文，亦应在可能条件下加以审阅，选择较好的公开发表，对其中有严重错误的，应向作者提出商榷意见。这个处理办法特别着重指出：对于专题研究论文、笔记、心得、报告的处理应当采取多鼓励多帮助的办法，以提高大家学习的积极性和信心。但对于其中观点有严重错误的，亦应及时提出，反复商讨，借以搞通思想提高认识。
    截至目前为止，西北局理论学习中心小组已讨论和处理了十九篇专题研究论文，西安市委理论学习中心小组也已举行过讨论处理专题研究论文的会议。对于尚未完成专题研究论文的同志，西北局及西北各省、市党委宣传部正在加紧督催。
