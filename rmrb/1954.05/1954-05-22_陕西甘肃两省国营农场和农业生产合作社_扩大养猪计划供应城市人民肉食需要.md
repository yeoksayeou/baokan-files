　　Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces State-owned Farms and Agricultural Production Cooperatives
　　Expand Pig Raising Plans to Supply Meat to Urban Residents
　　State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places are actively expanding their pig raising plans to supply meat to workers in mining areas and urban residents. The state-owned Zhangye Tractor Station Farm in Gansu Province is preparing to further expand pig raising. In terms of feeding management, they have achieved separate pen management and regular feeding, and have also initially established some hygiene and disinfection systems, so the pigs are growing healthily. This year, the state-owned Hanzhong Pig Farm in Shaanxi will breed more than 470 crossbred piglets with good body types and fast meat growth, all of which will be supplied to state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives for raising. This year, Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, plans to increase the number of pigs by 9,681, an increase of 72 percent compared to the actual number of pigs in the county last year. The Xixiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions to organizations at the district and township levels, requiring all cadres to specifically help farmers collect pigweed, find wild vegetables, and plant crops such as pumpkins and sweet potatoes to solve the problem of pig feed. This year, the number of pig-raising households in Lianhua Township, Nanzheng County, has increased to more than 310, raising more than 610 pigs, which is double the number in 1949, with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams raising the most. It is estimated that this year, just by selling pigs and supplying meat, the township can increase its income by more than 150 million yuan. The nine vegetable production cooperatives established in the suburbs of Xi'an this year have all formulated pig raising plans, and will increase the number of pigs by 97 this year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are also actively helping farmers solve the problems of pig feed and sales. For example, the No. 9 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xi'an City has solved the problem of raw materials for sideline products of mutual aid teams through supply and marketing combination contracts. The raw materials needed by the mutual aid teams for making tofu and noodles are supplied by the supply and marketing cooperative, and the supply and marketing cooperative is responsible for selling the products. The Xixiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also systematically supplies farmers with feed such as rice bran, wheat bran, and distiller's grains in pig raising areas, and the county's grain department also entrusts the supply and marketing cooperative to sell some coarse grains on behalf of farmers for "fattening" pigs.

    陕西甘肃两省国营农场和农业生产合作社
    扩大养猪计划供应城市人民肉食需要
    陕西、甘肃等地国营农场、农业生产合作社和互助组积极扩大养猪计划，供应工矿区和城市人民肉食需要。甘肃省国营张掖马拉机农场准备继续扩大养猪。在饲养管理方面，已做到了分圈管理，定时喂养，还初步建立了一些卫生消毒制度，猪的生长都很健康。陕西国营汉中猪场今年将繁殖四百七十多口体型好、长肉快的杂种仔猪，全部供应国营农场和农业生产合作社饲养。陕西省西乡县今年计划增殖毛猪九千六百八十一口，比去年全县实有猪数增加了百分之七十二。中共西乡县委已向区、乡各级组织发出指示，要求全体干部具体帮助农民打猪草、找野菜，种植南瓜、番薯等作物，解决猪的饲料问题。南郑县莲花乡全乡养猪户今年已发展到三百一十多户，养猪六百一十多口，比一九四九年增加了一倍，其中以农业生产合作社和互助组养的最多。估计今年光按出卖毛猪，供应肉食计算，全乡今年即可增加收入一亿五千多万元。西安市郊区今年成立起来的九个蔬菜生产合作社，都订出了养猪计划，今年共增加毛猪九十七口。各地供销合作社也积极帮助农民解决养猪的饲料和销路问题。如西安市九区供销合作社通过供销结合合同，解决了互助组副业产品的原料问题，各互助组做豆腐、粉面所需原料由供销社供给，产品也由供销社负责推销。西乡县供销合作社也在养猪地区有计划的供应农民米糠、麸皮和酒糟等饲料，该县粮食部门也委托供销合作社代销部分粗粮作为农民给猪“催膘”时需用。     （白槐）
