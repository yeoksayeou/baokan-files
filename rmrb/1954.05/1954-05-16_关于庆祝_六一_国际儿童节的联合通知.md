This year's "June 1st" International Children's Day falls in the second year of our country's entry into planned construction. Inspired by the general task, the people of the whole country are fighting with selfless labor to build our country into a great socialist country, which will bring a more beautiful future to the younger generation. In recent years, under the kind care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the new generation is growing rapidly. On the other hand, the strength of the peace and democracy camp and the peace movement against the crisis of a new war have become stronger, while the imperialist war-mongers are still stepping up the creation of international tensions, threatening world peace. Therefore, when commemorating "June 1st" International Children's Day this year, our slogan is: Struggle for peace, for socialism, and for the happy life of children.

This year’s "June 1st" International Children's Day should, in the spirit of the general task, conduct patriotic and internationalist education for children, so that they can understand the great achievements of the motherland's construction and love the socialist future of the motherland. Educate them to understand the importance of labor for national construction, to more consciously study and exercise, and to aspire to be outstanding laborers of the socialist motherland. At the same time, it is necessary to educate and cultivate children's lofty internationalist spirit and a spirit of friendship with the people of all countries. The people of the whole country and parents should work harder and better for the creation and defense of children's happy lives, contribute all their strength to completing the tasks of the national construction plan, and correctly care for and educate their children. Children's care, health care, and education workers across the country should continue to carry forward the noble spirit of serving the people diligently and dedicating themselves to the cause of childcare and education. Constantly improve their political and ideological level, study their professions, improve education and health care methods, and cultivate children to become all-round developed people. Literary artists, scientists, and publishing workers should strive to create and publish more and better works for children. Schools, Young Pioneer organizations, families, and society should all care and cooperate closely to gradually create better learning, living environment and activity conditions for children, and enrich children's lives. Oppose all behaviors and phenomena that endanger children's physical and mental health. Make unremitting efforts for the healthy growth of the new generation of our great motherland.

To this end, this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day, all localities should continue to unite relevant government departments and people's organizations to actively prepare for the celebration of "June 1st." On the basis of summarizing past experience, according to local specific conditions, carry out various activities suitable for children's age characteristics and interests, so that children can spend their holidays easily and happily and be educated. Where conditions permit, schools and education and care institutions and other units can hold sports performances, ball games, artistic performances (including music, dance, drama, recitation, etc.), various scientific, artistic works or academic achievement exhibitions, campfires, and communications and parties with volunteers, the People's Liberation Army, and model workers, etc. on or around "June 1st." This kind of activity that shows children's own achievements and is prepared and participated in by the children themselves is the most interesting and educational way to celebrate. "June 1st" activities can also invite local out-of-school children and parents to participate and visit. In the activities celebrating "June 1st," we should still prevent the tendency of excessive time, too many adult-like reports and speeches, and failure to pay attention to protecting children's health and safety.

Around "June 1st" International Children's Day, all localities should vigorously carry out publicity work, publicizing that caring for children is the virtue and common responsibility of the people of New China, publicizing the important significance of children's care and education work, publicizing the various achievements in children's work and the model deeds of outstanding children's care, health care, and education workers, publicizing correct educational ideas and educational methods. Through this publicity, the work of cultivating socialist new people will be greatly promoted with the common care and active support of all sectors of society. In the vast rural areas, primary schools should be the center, and it is hoped that teachers will carry out publicity among students' parents and the masses. In cities, publicity can be carried out through newspapers, radio stations, and other publicity agencies, holding conferences of children's care and education workers or various symposiums, and holding lectures and exhibitions.

    关于庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的联合通知
    今年的“六一”国际儿童节，正是我们祖国进入有计划建设的第二年，全国人民在总任务的鼓舞下，以忘我的劳动为建设我国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争，这将给年轻的一代带来更加美好的前途。几年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的亲切关怀下，新的一代正迅速地成长。另一方面，和平民主阵营的力量和反对新战争危机的和平运动更加壮大，而帝国主义好战分子仍在加紧制造国际紧张局势，威胁着世界的和平。因此，在今年纪念“六一”国际儿童节的时候，我们的口号是：为和平、为社会主义、为儿童的幸福生活而斗争。
    今年“六一”国际儿童节，要根据总任务的精神，对儿童进行爱国主义和国际主义教育，使他们了解祖国建设的伟大成就，热爱祖国的社会主义前途。教育他们认识劳动对于国家建设的重要性，更加自觉地学习和锻炼身体，立志做社会主义祖国的优秀劳动者。同时要教育和培养儿童具有崇高的国际主义精神、和各国人民之间的友好的精神。全国人民和父母们，应该为创造和保卫儿童的幸福生活更好地努力生产和工作，为完成国家建设计划的任务而贡献一切力量，并且要正确地关怀和教养自己的子女。全国的儿童保育、保健、教育工作者，要继续发扬勤勤恳恳为人民服务、为儿童保教事业而献身献力的高尚精神。不断提高自己的政治思想水平，钻研业务，改进教育和保健的方法，培养儿童成为全面发展的人。文学艺术家、科学家和出版工作者，要为儿童创作和出版更多更好的作品而努力。学校、少年先锋队组织、家庭、社会都应该共同关心和通力合作，逐渐为儿童创造更好的学习、生活环境和活动的条件，丰富儿童的生活。反对一切危害儿童身心健康的行为和现象。为我们伟大祖国新的一代的健全的成长作坚持不懈的斗争。
    为此，今年“六一”国际儿童节，各地仍应联合政府有关部门和人民团体，积极做好庆祝“六一”的筹备工作，在总结过去经验的基础上，根据当地具体条件，多方面地开展适合儿童年龄特点与兴趣的活动，使儿童轻松愉快地度过自己的节日，并受到教育。有条件的地方、学校和教养院等单位，在“六一”或“六一”前后，可举行适合于儿童的体育表演、球类比赛，文艺会演（包括音乐、舞蹈、戏剧、朗诵等），各种科学、艺术作品或学业成绩的展览会，营火会以及与志愿军、解放军、劳动模范等通讯和联欢等等。这种表现儿童自己成绩和儿童自己准备和参加的活动，是儿童最感兴趣和富有教育意义的庆祝方式。“六一”活动并可邀请当地校外儿童和家长参加和参观。在庆祝“六一”的活动中，仍应防止时间过长，成人化的报告、讲话太多，以及不注意保护儿童的健康与安全等的偏向。
    在“六一”国际儿童节前后，各地应大力展开宣传工作，宣传爱护与关心儿童是新中国人民的美德和共同的责任，宣传儿童保教工作的重要意义，宣传儿童工作中的各项成绩和优秀的儿童保育、保健、教育工作者的模范事迹，宣传正确的教育思想和教育方法，通过这种宣传，使培养社会主义新人的工作，在社会各方面的共同关怀和积极支持下大大地推进一步。在广大农村中，应以小学校为中心，希望教师们在学生家长以及群众中间进行宣传。在城市中可通过报刊、电台等宣传机构，召开儿童保教工作者大会或各种座谈会，举办讲座和展览会等等进行宣传。
