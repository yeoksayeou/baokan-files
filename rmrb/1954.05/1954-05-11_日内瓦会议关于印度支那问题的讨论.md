    As the second stage of the Geneva Conference—the discussion on the question of restoring peace in Indochina—began, cries for intensifying intervention and expanding the war were constantly coming from Washington. Dulles's proposed uncompromising strategy has hindered the progress of the first stage of the conference—the general debate on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and the first meeting of the Soviet Union, Britain, France, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and North and South Korea.

    Dulles, from Washington, threatened against reaching an armistice or ceasefire agreement in Indochina on terms acceptable to both sides. After returning to Washington, Dulles delivered a radio address in which he again harped on the old tune of the "urgent need" to take "united action" if the war continued. The cessation of hostilities that the world expects may be delayed by putting forward unacceptable demands.

    Dulles's early departure from the conference showed that the United States was not eager to negotiate and achieve a ceasefire in Indochina. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that Washington is concerned with continuing the war and delaying the Geneva Conference so that Dulles can achieve other goals behind the scenes. Reports in American and Western newspapers do not hide the fact that the main purpose of the US delegation to the Geneva Conference is not to negotiate, but to use all means to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and drag other countries along to expand the Indochina war.

    The general debate on the Korean question was adjourned three times because the US delegation could not find another speaker to support the US's uncompromising attitude of not withdrawing American troops from Korea and expanding the Rhee Syngman regime to North Korea under "United Nations supervision." Eden and Bidault have not yet signed up to speak, and it is said that no one will speak on the 10th (Monday) either.

    Obviously, the US delegation is not in a hurry, and neither is the French delegation. The French delegation spent seven days reaching an agreement on the issue of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the conference. After the Vietnamese delegation arrived, it took another five days to reach an agreement to start negotiations on the Indochina issue. The purpose of this delay was to allow Washington time to drive its allies to take a consistent attitude after Dulles's attempt to engage in "united action" before the opening of the conference was met with "diplomatic failure," and to make Bao Dai's representatives act according to the requirements of the United States.

    On the first day of the Indochina negotiations, an uncompromising tone similar to Dulles's appeared. Smith and Bidault refused the request of the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos to send representatives to the conference, arguing that peace in Indochina was related to the three countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

    Bidault's proposal to implement a ceasefire based on conditions drafted by the French government is seen here as an arbitrary condition put forward from an outdated colonialist attitude that demands the surrender of the Vietnamese people. However, the recent liberation of Dien Bien Phu has shown that the French army is not the victor on the battlefield. Bidault demanded the withdrawal of the Vietnamese People's Army, but made no mention of the withdrawal of the French army. Bidault's conditions included conditions regarding the resistance governments of Laos and Cambodia, which were not represented at the conference.

    There are also indications that the US delegation's goal is not to stop hostilities in Indochina. According to the French newspaper "Le Monde," the American representatives did not believe that a ceasefire in Indochina was possible. Someone asked an American representative what would happen if France agreed to a ceasefire. The representative replied: "This does not mean that Bao Dai also agrees."

    Bao Dai's so-called declaration of independence is apparently part of the US plan to detach him from the French government so that Bao Dai can be used as a counterweight against a peaceful resolution when Bidault cannot withstand the pressure of public opinion demanding peace. It is known that Bao Dai's recent sudden political activity has been directed by the United States.

    Shortly before leaving Geneva, Dulles revealed at a special press conference for American journalists that talks were being held in Geneva and Washington with Britain, France, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries to discuss the establishment of a "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" in the Pacific region. Eisenhower's recent statement on the Far East issue has confirmed this. He said:
  "Plans for achieving a security arrangement in Southeast Asia are underway." He then said meaningfully: "The fact that this organization is in the process of being established may have a significant impact on what happens in Geneva during the part of the meeting that discusses the Indochina issue."

    People have already condemned the practice of establishing this US-dominated aggressive bloc in Asia, saying it is a "big stick" to the Geneva Conference. Dulles's timetable for taking "united action" before the opening of the Geneva Conference failed to materialize. After suffering this setback, Eisenhower and Dulles are now saying that this goal should be achieved during the conference. They will do everything possible to hinder the progress of the conference and use the negotiations on the Indochina issue to put pressure on France, Britain, and Asian countries so that the United States can further penetrate Asia in the name of "Southeast Asian security." Behind this resounding name is the repeatedly announced US policy of "using Asians to fight Asians."

    The shadow of US interference and the maintenance of colonialism in Southeast Asia hangs over the negotiations on the restoration of peace in Indochina. The US policy of intensifying interference and infiltration in Southeast Asia stands in stark contrast to the principles of respecting national rights and freedoms and allowing the people of Asia to resolve their own affairs without foreign interference, as elucidated by Foreign Ministers Molotov and Zhou Enlai. This is why, on the one hand, the US delegation closes the door and prevents more Asian countries from participating in meetings that decide Asian issues, while on the other hand, the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China express regret that Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Pakistan cannot participate in the meeting.

    The fact that the United States does not allow other Asian countries to participate in the Geneva Conference, which is specifically discussing Asian issues, proves that the US policy of organizing a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc is in conflict with the interests of the Asian people. Behind the Indochina issue lies the major question of whether the US plan of interference can be stopped in time to achieve peace in Asia and the world.

    日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论
    新华社特派记者　沈建图
    和日内瓦会议的第二阶段——关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论——开始的同时，从华盛顿不断传来加紧干涉和扩大战争的叫嚣。杜勒斯提出不妥协的战略已阻碍了会议的第一阶段——关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一般辩论以及苏、英、法、美、中华人民共和国和南北朝鲜的第一次会议——的进展。
    杜勒斯从华盛顿扬言反对按照双方可以接受的条件达成印度支那停战或停火的协议。杜勒斯回到华盛顿后发表了一篇广播演说，他在演说中又重弹了如果战争继续下去“迫切需要”采取“联合行动”的老调。全世界所期待的停止敌对行动，可能由于提出不可能接受的要求而被拖延下去。
    杜勒斯很早离开会议这件事就表明：美国并不急于进行谈判和在印度支那实现停火。恰恰相反，有充分的证据证明，华盛顿所关心的是继续进行战争和拖延日内瓦会议，以便杜勒斯在幕后达到其他目的。美国和西方报纸的报道并不隐讳：美国出席日内瓦会议的代表团的主要目的不是为了进行谈判，而是用一切办法来组织东南亚侵略集团，拖着其他国家一道扩大印度支那战争。
    关于朝鲜问题的一般辩论曾休会三次，因为美国代表团找不到别的发言人为美国不自朝鲜撤退美国军队并在“联合国监督”下把李承晚政权扩大到北朝鲜的不妥协态度帮腔，艾登和皮杜尔还没有报名发言，据说十日（星期一）也没有人发言。
    显而易见，美国代表团是不会着急的，法国代表团也是不会着急的。为了就越南民主共和国出席会议问题取得一致意见，法国代表团花了七天的时间。在越南代表团到达后，为了就开始谈判印度支那问题取得一致意见，又花了五天的时间。这种拖延的目的是想使华盛顿有时间来驱策它的盟国在杜勒斯企图在会议开幕之前搞“联合行动”而遭到“外交失败”之后采取一致态度，并使保大的代表按着美国的要求行事。
    印度支那问题谈判的第一天出现了和杜勒斯一样的不妥协的语调。史密斯和皮杜尔拒绝高棉和寮国两国抗战政府所提出的派遣代表出席会议的要求，它们之所以提出这种要求是因为印度支那的和平和越南、高棉和寮国这三个国家有关。
    皮杜尔所提出的根据法国政府拟订的条件实行停火的建议，这里都认为是要求越南人民投降的陈旧的殖民主义态度提出的专横条件。但是，最近奠边府的解放已经表明，法国军队并不是战场上的胜利者。皮杜尔要求越南人民军撤退，但并没有提到法国军队的撤退。皮杜尔提出的条件中包括了关于没有代表出席会议的寮国抗战政府和高棉抗战政府的条件。
    还有迹象表明，美国代表团的目的并不在于停止印度支那的敌对行动。据法国报纸“新闻报”报道，美国代表不相信在印度支那实现停火是可能的。有人问一个美国代表，如果法国同意停火，那末怎么办。这个代表回答道：“这并不意味着保大也同意。”
    保大的所谓独立宣言显然是美国使他脱离法国政府的计划的一部分，以便在皮杜尔受不了舆论要求和平的压力的时候可以利用保大作为反对和平解决的砝码。大家知道，保大最近突然在政治上活跃起来，这是受美国指使的。
    杜勒斯在离开日内瓦以前不久为美国记者举行的一次特别新闻发布会上透露，正在日内瓦和华盛顿和英国、法国、新西兰、澳大利亚、泰国、菲律宾以及其他国家进行会谈，讨论建立太平洋地区的“北大西洋公约组织”问题。艾森豪威尔最近发表的关于远东问题的声明已证实了这一点。他说：
  “关于实现东南亚的安全安排的计划正在进行中。”他接着意味深长地说：“这个组织正在建立的过程中，这一事实可能对在举行讨论印度支那问题那一部分会议期间在日内瓦发生的情况具有重大影响。”
    人们已在斥责在亚洲建立这个受美国支配的侵略集团的做法，说这是对日内瓦会议的一根“大棒”。杜勒斯在日内瓦会议开幕以前采取“联合行动”的时间表没有能够实行。在遭受这种挫败以后，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯现在说，这个目标要在会议期间实现。他们将尽一切努力来阻挠会议的进行，利用关于印度支那问题的谈判来对法国、英国和亚洲国家施用压力，以便美国能在“东南亚安全”的名义下进一步打进亚洲。在这个响亮的名字背后是一再宣布的美国“利用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。
    美国在东南亚进行干涉和保持殖民主义的阴影笼罩着关于恢复印度支那和平的谈判。美国加紧干涉和渗入东南亚的政策，和莫洛托夫和周恩来外长所阐明的尊重民族权利和自由、让亚洲人民不受外来干预解决他们自己的事务的原则恰成鲜明的对照。为什么一方面美国代表团关上大门不让更多的亚洲国家参加决定亚洲问题的会议，而另一方面，苏联和中华人民共和国的代表团则对于像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和巴基斯坦这样的亚洲国家不能参加会议表示遗憾，其理由也就在这里。
    美国不让其他亚洲国家参加专门讨论亚洲问题的日内瓦会议这一事实证明，美国组织东南亚侵略集团的政策是和亚洲人民的利益相冲突的。在印度支那问题背后存在着能否及时制止美国进行干涉的计划以实现亚洲和世界和平这个重大问题。
