Workers of All Ethnic Groups Living in the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory in Xinjiang
Xu Baosheng
There are over two hundred workers from five ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Sibe, Hui, and Manchu, in the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory in Xinjiang. These two hundred-plus workers from fraternal ethnic groups live happily in the big family of the factory.

After female workers of various ethnic groups were assigned to different workshops, the workshop leaders assigned skilled workers to teach them the techniques. Every Han worker recognized that training workers of various ethnic groups was their glorious responsibility. Usually, they meticulously explained the basic knowledge of operating techniques and patiently taught them by demonstrating and explaining. With the efforts of the female workers of various ethnic groups to study diligently and learn humbly, they mastered the various production operation techniques they learned in just over a month. In the 1953 factory-wide commendation and model worker election, one ethnic minority worker was selected as a factory labor model, six as first-class meritorious workers, and twelve as second-class meritorious workers. Last year, during the general election, Uyghur worker Hasheng Maimaiti was honorably elected as a representative to the district people's congress.

The workers of all ethnic groups in the factory can promote the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance in life, and they can respect each other's customs. Some of the female workers in the factory came from the warmer southern Xinjiang and Yili, and they were not accustomed to the colder climate of northern Xinjiang. They brought fewer quilts and clothes, so the factory leaders and workers helped them solve the problems of quilts and other clothes and socks. The factory also specially opened ethnic canteens and schools. The religious beliefs of the workers of all ethnic groups are also respected by everyone. For example, when fraternal ethnic groups celebrate the Corban Festival and the Roukao Festival, the responsible comrades of the factory's Party committee, administration, trade union, and youth league, as well as Han workers, warmly go to congratulate them, and the atmosphere is full of unity and friendship everywhere. Therefore, Uyghur Deputy Director Yilaliding said, "In the past, there was no industry in Xinjiang, and our ethnic minorities were discriminated against, living a miserable life like cattle and horses. Today, under the education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Han workers take care of us in every possible way in production, study, and life."

The workers of all fraternal ethnic groups not only love labor and work actively, but also are happy and enthusiastic in life. The workers of all ethnic groups, who are good at singing and dancing, happily play their favorite instruments—skin drums and Dongshila—in the dormitory or on the open ground after work, singing and dancing! Everywhere is filled with the joyful mood after labor.

    生活在新疆七一棉纺织厂的各民族工人们
    徐宝生
    新疆七一棉纺织厂里有二百多名包括维吾尔、哈萨克、锡伯、回、满等五个民族的工人。这二百多名兄弟民族工人愉快的生活在工厂的大家庭里。
    各民族女工被分配到各车间后，车间领导上都派熟练工人负责教给她们技术。每个汉族工人认识到培养各民族工人是自己的光荣责任，平时，都能很细心的给她们讲解操作技术的基本知识，并采用了边表演边讲解的方法，耐心的教导她们，加上各民族女工自己的努力钻研，虚心学习，所以，只学了一个多月的时间，她们就都学会了所学的各种生产操作技术。在一九五三年全厂评功选举模范中，各民族工人被评选为厂劳动模范的有一名，一等功臣六名，二等功臣十二名。去年普选时，维吾尔族工人哈生马木提光荣的被选为区人民代表大会的代表。
    厂里的各民族工人，在生活上都能发挥友爱互助的精神，对各民族的风俗习惯也都能互相尊重。厂里有的女工是从暖和的南疆和伊犁来的，不习惯北疆较冷的气候，带来的棉被、衣服也较少，厂领导上和工人们帮她们解决了被子以及其他衣服、袜子等问题。厂里还特地专门开办了民族食堂和学校。各民族工人的宗教信仰也受到大家的尊重。如当兄弟民族过库尔班节，肉考节的时候，工厂党委、行政、工会、青年团的负责同志以及汉族工人们都热情的去道贺，处处充满了团结友爱的气氛。所以维族副厂长义拉里丁这样说：“过去新疆没有工业，我们少数民族是被歧视的，过着悲惨的牛马生活，今天在共产党和毛主席教育下的汉族工人，无论在生产、学习、生活上都无微不至地照顾我们。”
    各兄弟民族工人不仅是热爱劳动，积极工作的，在生活上也是愉快热情的。善歌善舞的各民族的工人们下班后，无论在宿舍里，在旷场上，就愉快地弹起自己喜爱的乐器—皮鼓和东石拉，唱啊！跳啊！到处洋溢着劳动后的愉快情绪。
