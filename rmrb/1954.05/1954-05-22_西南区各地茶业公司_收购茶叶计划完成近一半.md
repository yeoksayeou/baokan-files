Tea companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in Southwest China are actively purchasing new tea. As of May 5th, the region had completed 46.27% of its annual tea purchasing plan. Sichuan Province has completed over 70% of its black tea purchasing plan, and Yunnan Province has completed over 70% of its domestic tea purchasing plan. It is expected that the region's tea purchasing plan for this year will be completed smoothly or even overfulfilled.

Prior to the purchase of new tea, tea companies in various provinces held training classes for tea evaluation personnel and, together with cadres from the China Tea Company and the Southwest China Company, organized several working groups to go to key tea-producing areas to inspect the preparations for purchasing. At the same time, tea companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and farmers in many tea-producing areas such as Junlian, Gao County, and Yibin in Sichuan Province signed tea pre-purchase contracts and paid tea farmers a batch of pre-purchase deposits, which greatly supported tea farmers in timely tea picking. During the tea-picking season, Wanxian Special District in Sichuan Province and Shunping County in Yunnan Province found ways to adjust manpower and overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor in some tea-producing areas, so that new tea could be picked in time. Yunnan Province also strengthened the supply of materials to remote tea-producing areas; commercial departments in various places also organized mobile teams to go deep into tea-producing areas to supply tea farmers with means of production and livelihood materials.

At present, the spring tea picking work in Southwest China is coming to an end, and various places are seizing the opportunity to purchase more spring tea and are actively preparing for the purchase of summer tea. (Xiong Sen)

    西南区各地茶业公司
    收购茶叶计划完成近一半
    西南区各地茶业公司和供销合作社积极收购新茶。截至五月五日止，全区已完成全年茶叶收购计划百分之四十六点二七；四川省的红茶和云南省内销茶的收购计划都已完成百分之七十以上。预计今年全区收购茶叶计划可顺利完成或超额完成。
    在收购新茶以前，各省茶业公司曾先后举办了评茶人员学习班，并会同中国茶业公司及西南区公司派出的干部组织若干工作组，分赴重点茶区检查了收购准备工作。同时，茶业公司、供销合作社和四川省筠连、高县、宜宾等地许多茶区的农民签订了茶叶预购合同，付给茶农一批预购定金，对支持茶农及时采茶起了很大作用。在采茶期间，四川省万县专区、云南省顺宁县等地曾设法调剂人力，克服了有的茶区劳动力不足的困难，使新茶能及时采摘。云南省还加强了边远茶区的物资供应工作；各地商业部门也大都组织流动小组，深入茶区供应茶农生产资料和生活资料。
    目前，西南区春茶采摘工作已将近尾声，各地正抓紧时机争取多收一些春茶，并积极进行收购夏茶的准备工作。　（熊森）
