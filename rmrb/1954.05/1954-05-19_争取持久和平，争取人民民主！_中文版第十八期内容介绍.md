A brief introduction to the contents of the 18th issue of the Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" published in 1954.

The central theme of this issue is the celebration of International Labor Day on May 1st. This issue publishes an editorial titled "New Victory for the Forces Striving for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism!" and includes the following celebratory articles: "The Chinese Working Class Struggles to Realize the General Line of the State During the Transition Period" by Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; "The German People Welcome May Day" by Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic and Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; "Educating the Polish Working People in the Spirit of Proletarian Internationalism" by Ochab, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "A Festival of Grand Review of the International Proletariat" by Vittorio, Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions; and "Strive for Peace, Strive for the Great Unity of the Working People of the World" by Maurice Thorez, Member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party.

This issue also publishes in full the speeches delivered by Georgy Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, at the meetings of the Nationalities Chamber and the Union Chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, respectively, when discussing the 1954 state budget.

The editorial in this issue points out that this year, peace-loving forces in various countries are celebrating May Day under the banner of striving for further relaxation of international tensions and preventing a new war. The efforts of people of all countries to strive for peace have become a powerful driving force of the times. People of all countries are increasingly opposed to the revival of German militarism and resolutely advocate a thorough settlement of the Korean issue and a ceasefire in Indochina; they are resolutely opposed to the aggressive policies of powerful groups in the United States and their accomplices. Progressive humanity highly values the significant role played by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies in easing international tensions. The days when imperialism could arbitrarily plunder and oppress the people of colonies and dependencies are gone forever. The convening of the Geneva Conference is a great victory for peace-loving forces around the world who are sincerely concerned about easing international tensions. Under the current circumstances, the main task of peace-loving forces is to strive for further relaxation of international tensions, to do everything possible to promote peaceful cooperation between countries, and to strive for lasting peace. Communist and workers' parties in various countries are leading the masses of people to strive for new victories in the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Pieck's article first summarizes the situation of the German people's struggle for German reunification and national independence. He then points out that strengthening and consolidating the German Democratic Republic and improving the welfare of the Republic's citizens are the main keys to a peaceful solution of the German question. Based on this understanding, employees of state-owned enterprises in the German Democratic Republic are working hard to increase and improve production and reduce production costs in preparation for celebrating May Day. The slogan for laboring farmers and members of production cooperatives to celebrate May Day is: further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and expand mutual ties between industry and agriculture. Pieck emphasized that throughout Germany, more and more forces are joining the struggle against the revival of German militarism and against the implementation of the "European Defense Community" plan.

Vittorio's article points out: May Day is a festival to strengthen the international unity of the working class and all working people, a festival to take stock of battle results and summarize achievements in order to achieve new victories and achievements. This year, the working classes of the Soviet Union, People's China, and various people's democracies have made great strides on the road to developing the national economy and improving the material and cultural living standards of the people. The People's Republic of China is now participating in the Geneva Conference together with other major powers, contributing to the establishment of lasting peace in Korea, the realization of a ceasefire in Indochina, and the strengthening of world peace. Vittorio went on to say: In the past year, tens of thousands of actions by workers in all walks of life—partial strikes and general strikes, mass demonstrations, and lightning strikes—have taken place in colonial and capitalist countries. A characteristic of the situation in recent months is that the trade union movement and the mass movement for national independence are booming. The broad masses of working people are also beginning to understand more clearly that the only way to save themselves is to take concerted action and unite to fight. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第十八期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十八期已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。本期发表了题为“争取和平民主社会主义力量的新胜利！”的社论，并刊载了下列庆祝文章：中华全国总工会主席赖若愚的“中国工人阶级为实现国家在过渡时期的总路线而奋斗”，德意志民主共和国总统、德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员皮克的“德国人民迎接‘五一’节”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记奥哈布的“以无产阶级国际主义精神教育波兰劳动人民”，世界工会联合会主席维多里奥的“国际无产阶级力量大检阅的节日”，法国共产党政治局委员摩维的“争取和平，争取全世界劳动人民的大团结”。
    本期还全文刊载了苏联部长会议主席马林科夫和苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫分别在苏联最高苏维埃民族院和联盟院会议上讨论一九五四年国家预算时发表的演说。
    本期的社论指出：今年各国爱好和平的力量在争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势、防止新战争的斗争的旗帜下庆祝“五一”节。各国人民争取和平的努力已经成为当代的强大动力。各国人民越来越反对复活德国军国主义，坚决主张彻底解决朝鲜问题和在印度支那停火；他们正在坚决反对美国有势力的集团及其同伙的侵略政策。进步人类十分重视苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家为缓和国际紧张局势而作的努力所起的重大作用。帝国主义可以恣意掠夺和压迫殖民地和附属国人民的日子是一去不复返了。日内瓦会议的召开是衷心关怀缓和国际紧张局势的全世界爱好和平力量所取得的一个巨大胜利。在目前的情况下，爱好和平的力量的主要任务就是争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势，尽力促进各国间的和平合作，争取持久和平。各国共产党和工人党领导着人民群众争取和平、民主和社会主义事业的新胜利。
    皮克的文章首先综述了德国人民争取全德统一和民族独立的斗争情形。他接着指出：加强并巩固德意志民主共和国以及增进共和国公民的福利，是和平解决德国问题的主要关键。由于这种认识，德意志民主共和国国营企业中的职工在筹备庆祝“五一”节的过程中，努力增加和改进生产，减低生产成本。劳动农民和生产合作社社员庆祝“五一”节的口号是：进一步巩固工农联盟和扩大工农业之间的相互联系。皮克强调说：在整个德国，有越来越多的力量投入反对复活德国军国主义、反对实现
  “欧洲防务集团”计划的斗争。
    维多里奥的文章指出：“五一”节是加强工人阶级和全体劳动人民的国际团结的节日，是清点战果和总结成就以取得新的胜利和成就的节日。今年，苏联、人民中国和各人民民主国家的工人阶级，已经在发展国民经济和提高人民的物质和文化生活水平的道路上大踏步前进。中华人民共和国现在已和其他大国一起参加日内瓦会议，对在朝鲜建立持久和平、在印度支那实现停火和加强世界和平作出贡献。维多里奥接着说：过去一年，殖民地和资本主义国家发生了成千上万次各行各业工人的行动——部分罢工和总罢工、群众示威游行和闪电罢工。最近几个月的局势的一个特点是，工会运动和争取民族独立的群众运动正在蓬勃发展。广大的劳动群众还开始更清楚地懂得，自救的唯一道路就是采取一致行动，联合起来进行斗争。　（新华社）
