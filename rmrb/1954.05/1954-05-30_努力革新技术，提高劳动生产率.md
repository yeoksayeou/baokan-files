    Strive to Innovate Technology and Improve Labor Productivity
    Vast Number of Employees Offer Rationalization Proposals: The staff and workers of the Pingxiang Coal Mine proposed a total of 255 rationalization proposals in coal mining, tunneling, transportation, and electromechanical aspects from April 1 to May 10, of which 58 technological innovations have been successfully tested.
    These technological innovations have already demonstrated their significant impact on production. Ye Guanghua, the deputy captain of the water exploration team of Gaokeng Mine, improved the water exploration tools in early May. Previously, three people could only explore six meters in a day, but now, using the improved water exploration tools, one person can explore twelve meters in a day. There is a lot of underground water in Pingxiang Coal Mine, and the improvement of water exploration tools is of great significance for ensuring the safe production of various mines. This experience has been promoted in the water exploration teams of Gaokeng Mine. Mei Jun, an automobile driver of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, suggested changing the iron ground rollers that support the wire ropes on the endless cableway to wooden ground rollers wrapped with waste tires. The test results proved that a wooden ground roller can be used for at least one year, while an iron ground roller can be discarded after at most one month. After using wooden ground rollers, the wear rate of the wire ropes has been greatly reduced, and the number of parking accidents has also decreased significantly. The cost of using this wooden ground roller is very low. According to conservative estimates, Pingxiang Coal Mine can save 600 million yuan each year, not including the reduction in the wear rate of wire ropes and the reduction in parking accidents. The leadership of Pingxiang Mining Bureau is preparing to promote this wooden ground roller on all the endless cableways in the entire mine. Automobile driver Mei Jun has also developed an automatic coal loading machine that can replace manual coal loading. This is a valuable contribution to eliminating heavy physical labor and improving labor efficiency. This automatic coal loading machine is being rushed to manufacture at the Pingxiang Mining Bureau's Machinery Repair Factory. The staff and workers of the Machinery Repair Factory have decided to successfully trial-produce the first automatic coal loading machine before July 1st.
    The leadership of Pingxiang Coal Mine has given enthusiastic encouragement and strong support to the technological innovation activities of the employees. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau and the mine trade union organizations have put forward fifteen topics targeting the key problems existing in the current production of the entire mine, and called on the staff and workers to study and solve them. In order to promote the technological innovation movement, the leadership of Pingxiang Coal Mine has made preferential provisions in terms of workers' wages, materials, tools, and technical assistance. Under the instructions of the leadership, some engineering and technical personnel have given strong assistance to the workers in drawing drawings and carrying out designs. Wang Jiayuan Mine has also established a component manufacturing team including lathe workers, fitters, and electricians, specifically responsible for manufacturing the various components needed for the rationalization proposals that have been approved for trial production. In order to let the masses know the whereabouts of their rationalization proposals, the administrative side and the trade union organization of the Machinery Repair Factory held a rationalization proposal station team in early May, exhibiting the rationalization proposals put forward by the staff and workers in order of priority, showing the leadership's attention to the active suggestions of the staff and workers.

    Overcome Conservative Thinking, Support Advanced Thinking
    Since the Nanjing Joint State-Private Yongli Ning Factory launched the technological innovation movement in late March, the staff and workers have put forward more than 140 rationalization proposals, including 15 major creations and improvements, which, if implemented, are estimated to increase production and save the country more than 2.99 billion yuan annually.
    In the initial stage of learning from Wang Chonglun and carrying out the technological innovation movement, the conservative thinking among the staff and workers was very serious. The factory's Party committee, on the one hand, pointed out to all staff and workers that the important thing in learning from Wang Chonglun is to learn from his sense of ownership to realize the country's socialist industrialization as soon as possible, as well as his spirit of humbly learning from others, constantly improving tools, and assiduously studying technology. On the other hand, it educated Party and League members to take the lead, and vigorously publicized and supported advanced thinking and advanced deeds, encouraging the enthusiasm of the staff and workers. Li Yuzhu, a riveter, had proposed a suggestion for an automatic coal digging machine as early as last October, which was shelved by the technical section for more than four months. This time, with the support of the Party and the masses, he successfully created it. This machine can save 30 to 40 people digging coal, coke, and ore every day, and can save the country more than 400 million yuan annually. Deeds of technological innovation continue to emerge in the workshop. Office personnel are also actively using their brains. Liu Qingwen and others from the cost accounting section of the mechanical branch factory, learned from the Soviet advanced experience of "replacing accounts with tables" to improve accounting work, simplified two procedures, and can save a total of more than 36 million yuan in labor and account pages a year.
    The factory recently summarized the preliminary experience of carrying out the technological innovation movement, and the Party committee put forward specific measures based on the summary: 1. Establish advanced banners and award the honorary titles of labor model or advanced worker to Li Yuzhu and other 15 people; 2. Require Party and administrative departments to make monthly plans for technological innovation targeting weak links in production, and discover and support advanced buds in a timely manner; 3. The trade union and the technical section should jointly run a technological innovation training class to attract the majority of staff and workers to learn from the advanced.
    New Production Achievements Continue to Emerge
    The broad masses of staff and workers in Chongqing are constantly welcoming the technological innovation movement that will soon be launched in the city with new production achievements. When workers at Tianfu Coal Mine were excavating a stone roadway with a cross-section of 6.9 square meters in the limestone rock layer, they solved two key problems: pilot tunnel operation and needle breakage, so that the operation plan could be completed evenly on a daily and monthly basis. In April, they tunneled 175.2 meters, setting a new record. After the ironmaking workers of a blast furnace in State-owned 101 Steel Plant implemented the advanced furnace top adjustment method, they continuously created five new records after April 20. The highest daily output exceeded the revised planned daily output for April by 7 percent. After the 501 Power Plant promoted 25 advanced experiences this year, it created a new record of no accidents in the whole month for the first time in April.
    Chongqing's engineering and technical personnel have made new progress compared to the past in the process of combining with the practical experience of veteran workers. The rolling mill and steelmaking workshop of 104 Steel Plant were originally supplied with steam by four boilers. Liu Zhaofang, a veteran worker in the rolling mill, proposed that one boiler could replace four boilers based on his daily operating experience. This suggestion was finally realized after engineer Xu Baosheng found a way to reduce the steam consumption in the steelmaking plant. Replacing four boilers with one boiler can save more than 20 man-hours and more than 10 tons of coal every day.
    At present, in some factories and mines in Chongqing, technological innovation has begun to become a mass movement. Among the 64 workers in the tool workshop of Chongqing Machine Tool Factory, 16 production innovators appeared in April, and 47 workers overfulfilled their production plans. After the rolling mill workshop of 101 Steel Plant put forward the topic of automatic feeding of steel billets into the heating furnace in the first quarter, Cheng Helong, the chairman of the workshop trade union, technician Shen Naichang and other four people simultaneously made models and put forward certain technical data. After joint research by the four people, it finally became a relatively complete proposal. Now, this proposal has been realized. As long as you press the button, the steel billet can be sent into the heating furnace. Individual factories and mines, such as 601 Paper Mill, have also combined the discussion of the national plan for the second quarter to carry out mass technological innovation movements in a planned and guided manner. This factory not only completed the national output plan in April, but also reduced the consumption of raw materials such as bleaching powder, caustic soda, and sodium sulfide, improved the uniformity and whiteness of high-grade paper, and reduced the surface dust.

    Successful Creation of 7.6-Inch Weft Bobbin
    In the technological innovation movement, Kang Qian, an engineer, technicians Li Baotai and Chen Shunfu, and technician Zhang Runhai of the Shanxi Local State-owned Jinhua Textile Factory, successfully tried to use a 7.6-inch large weft bobbin to spin warp and weft yarn. This is a major creation, breaking the historical practice of using 7-inch bobbins in the textile industry and saving a lot of wealth for the country. According to test results: Using a 7.6-inch weft bobbin to spin 18-count warp yarn increases the capacity by 38% compared to a 7-inch bobbin; doffing is extended from 72 minutes to 100 minutes, which can reduce doffing by 4.5 times a day, saving 23% of the manpower for wheel cart doffing and tube arranging and other types of work. Using a 7.6-inch weft bobbin to spin 18-count weft yarn increases the capacity by 68%, and wheel cart doffing and other types of work can save 40% of manpower. According to preliminary calculations, if the factory uses all 7.6-inch large weft bobbins to spin 18-count warp and weft yarn, it can save 2.42 billion yuan annually just by increasing labor productivity and reducing wages. At the same time, due to the increase in machine operating time, it can increase production by 2.26 billion yuan. The above two items can increase production and save a total of 4.68 billion yuan. Because the number of yarn breaks and weft changes during doffing is reduced, the quality of yarn and cloth is also greatly improved.
    Mining Machine Tries to Use Cemented Carbide Drill Bits
    Under the guidance of Soviet expert Alyamski, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Gongchangling Iron Mine successfully tried to use cemented carbide drill bits for mining. In the past, the drill bits used in mine rock drills were all made of carbon steel. This kind of drill bit is softer than cemented carbide drill bits, has low wear resistance, and has slow tunneling efficiency. The test results of Gongchangling Iron Mine proved that: using the same rock drill to drill on the hardest grade of rock, carbon steel drill bits can only drill 9 meters in 5 hours, while cemented carbide drill bits can drill 23 meters. Sun Zhenhai's group used cemented carbide drill bits and created a record of advancing 36 meters in 5 hours on April 21, an efficiency three times higher than using carbon steel drill bits. When drilling with carbon steel drill bits, it is necessary to change the drill bit five or six times for every meter drilled; when drilling with cemented carbide drill bits, it is only necessary to change the drill bit once for every meter drilled. Therefore, using cemented carbide drill bits can also save the time of changing drill bits up and down and two or three handling workers. After Gongchangling Iron Mine fully promotes this advanced experience, it can reduce costs by about 5 billion yuan throughout the year. In order to fully promote this experience, the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have organized a working group to assist in the promotion in Cherry Orchard, Qidaogou, Dashiqiao and other mines.

    努力革新技术，提高劳动生产率
    广大职工提出合理化建议萍乡煤矿职工群众从四月一日到五月十日，在采煤、掘进、运输、机电等方面共提出合理化建议二百五十五件，其中已有五十八件技术革新试验成功。
    这些技术革新已经显示出它对生产的重大影响。高坑矿探水八队副队长叶光华，在五月上旬改良了探水工具。从前三个人一天只能探进六公尺，现在使用改良的探水工具，一个人一天就可探进十二公尺。萍乡煤矿地下水很多，探水工具的改良对保证各矿井的安全生产有重要意义。这一经验已在高坑矿各探水队推广。萍乡矿务局汽车司机梅俊建议把无极索道上承托钢丝绳的铁质地滚改为包有废轮胎的木质地滚。试验结果证明：一个木地滚最少可用一年，铁地滚顶多只用一个多月就得废弃。使用木地滚以后，钢丝绳的磨损率大大降低，停车事故也显著减少。改用这种木地滚成本很低，按保守的算法，萍乡煤矿每年也可节省六亿元，而且钢丝绳的磨损率降低和停车事故的减少等还不包括在内。萍乡矿务局领导方面正准备在全矿所有的无极索道上推广这种木地滚。汽车司机梅俊还研究出了一种自动装煤机，可以代替人工装煤。这对消除繁重的体力劳动，提高劳动效率是一个很有价值的贡献。这种自动装煤机正在萍乡矿务局机械修理厂赶制。机械修理厂职工决定在“七一”以前，把第一部自动装煤机试制成功。
    萍乡煤矿领导方面对职工们的技术革新活动给了热情的鼓励和大力的支持。萍乡矿务局和矿区工会组织针对当前全矿生产中存在的关键问题提出了十五个课题，号召职工群众研究解决。萍乡煤矿领导方面为了推动技术革新运动，在工人工资、材料、工具、技术帮助等方面，都作出了优惠的规定。在领导方面的指示下，有些工程技术人员在绘制图纸和进行设计方面给了工人们以有力的帮助。王家源矿还建立了一个包括车工、钳工、电工在内的机件制造小组，专门负责制造已被批准试制的合理化建议所需要的各种机件。机械修理厂的行政方面和工会组织为了使群众知道自己所提合理化建议的下落，曾在五月上旬举办了合理化建议站队，把职工群众提出来的合理化建议按着轻重缓急排列展览，表示了领导方面对职工群众积极建议的重视。

    克服保守思想支持先进思想
    南京公私合营永利宁厂从三月下旬开展技术革新运动以来，职工们提出了一百四十多件合理化建议，其中十五件较大的创造改进，实行后估计全年可为国家增产节约二十九亿九千多万元。
    在学习王崇伦，开展技术革新运动初期，职工群众中保守思想很严重。该厂党委一面向全体职工指出，学习王崇伦，重要的是在于学习他时刻为提早实现国家的社会主义工业化的主人翁思想，以及他虚心向别人学习、不断改进工具、刻苦钻研技术的精神。一面教育党、团员起带头作用，并对先进思想和先进事迹大力进行宣传和支持，鼓舞职工们的热情。铆工李玉柱早在去年十月提的自动挖煤机的建议，被技术科搁了四个多月，这次在党和群众支持下创造成功。这部机器，每天可节省三四十个挖煤、焦、矿石的人力，全年可为国家节省四亿多元。车间不断涌现出技术革新的事迹。科室人员也积极开动脑筋。机械分厂成本核算股刘清文等，学习苏联先进经验“以表代账”，改进记账工作，简化了两道手续，一年可节省人工、账页共三千六百多万元。
    该厂最近总结了开展技术革新运动的初步经验，党委并根据总结提出了具体的措施：一、树立先进旗帜，授予李玉柱等十五人以劳动模范或先进工作者的光荣称号；二、要求党、行政部门，针对生产薄弱环节，按月做出技术革新的计划，及时发现先进萌芽，加以扶持；三、由工会、技术科协同开办一个技术革新训练班，吸引广大职工向先进者学习。
    新的生产成就不断出现
    重庆市广大职工不断以新的生产成就，迎接不久就要在全市展开的技术革新运动。天府煤矿工人在石灰石岩层中开挖六点九平方公尺断面的石巷时，解决了导坑作业和断针等两个关键问题，使作业计划得以按日按月均衡地完成。四月份，他们掘进一百七十五点二公尺，创造了新纪录。国营一零一钢铁厂某号高炉的炼铁工人推行先进的炉顶调剂操作法后，四月二十日以后连续创造了五次新纪录。最高的日产量比四月份修改后的计划日产量超过百分之七。五零一电力厂今年推广二十五种先进经验后，四月份第一次创造了全月无事故的新纪录。
    重庆市的工程技术人员，在和老工人的实践经验相结合的过程中，比以前有了新的进展。一零四钢铁厂的轧钢车间和炼钢车间，原来是由四部锅炉供应蒸汽的。轧钢车间老工人刘照芳根据平日操作经验，提出由一个锅炉代替四个锅炉的建议。这个建议经工程师徐宝升设法减少炼钢场蒸汽用量后，终于实现了。由一个锅炉代替四个锅炉，每天可以节省二十多个人工，节省十多吨煤。
    目前，在重庆市的部分厂矿中，技术革新已开始成为群众性的运动。重庆机床厂工具车间六十四个工人中，四月份出现了十六个生产革新者，四十七个工人超额完成了自己的生产计划。一零一钢铁厂轧钢车间第一季度提出烘钢炉自动喂钢胚的课题后，有车间工会主席程和龙，技工沈乃昌等四人，同时做出模型和提出一定的技术资料。经过四个人的共同研究，最后成为一个比较完善的建议。现在，这个建议已经实现，只要一按电钮，钢胚就可送进烘钢炉里去了。个别厂矿如六零一造纸厂等，并已结合讨论第二季度的国家计划，有计划有领导地开展了群众性的技术革新运动。这个厂四月份不但完成了国家产量计划，而且减少了漂白粉、烧碱、硫化碱等原料的消耗，提高了高级纸张的均匀度和白度，减少了表面的尘埃度。　（新华社）
      七吋六的纬纱管创造成功
    山西地方国营晋华纺织厂工程师康谦、技术员李保太、陈顺甫和技工张润海在技术革新运动中，试用七吋六的大纬纱管纺经纬纱成功。这是一项重大的创造，它打破了纺织业中使用七吋纱管的历史惯例，为国家节约了大量财富。据试验结果证明：使用七吋六的纬纱管纺十八支的经纱，较七吋纱管增加容量百分之三十八；落纱由相隔七十二分钟延长到一百分钟，一天即可减少落纱四次半，可节省摇车落纱摆管等工种的人力百分之二十三。使用七吋六的纬纱管纺十八支的纬纱，容量增加百分之六十八，摇车落纱等工种可节省人力百分之四十。据初步计算，若该厂全部使用七吋六大纬纱管纺十八支经纬纱，仅提高劳动生产率减少工资一项，全年即可节约二十四亿二千万元，同时由于机器运转时间的增加，可增产二十二亿六千万元。上述两项共可增产节约四十六亿八千万元。因落纱断头换纬次数减少，对纱布质量也有很大提高。
    采矿机试用硬质合金钎头
    鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿在苏联专家阿良姆斯基指导下，试用硬质合金钎头采矿成功。过去矿山凿岩机使用的钎头，都是炭素钢制作的。这种钎头比硬质合金钎头软，耐磨性能低，掘进效率慢。弓长岭铁矿试验的结果证明：用同样的凿岩机在最硬的一级岩石上凿岩，炭素钢钎头每五小时只能钻孔九公尺，硬质合金钎头能钻孔二十三公尺。孙振海小组使用硬质合金钎头，在四月二十一日创造了五小时进三十六公尺的纪录，效率比用炭素钢钎头提高了三倍。用炭素钢钎头钻孔，每钻进一公尺要换五六次钎头；用硬质合金钎头钻孔，每钻一公尺只要换一次钎头。因此用硬质合金钎头，还可以节省上下换钎的时间和两三个搬运工人。弓长岭铁矿全面推行这一先进经验以后，全年大约可以降低成本五十亿元左右。为了全面推广这个经验，鞍钢领导方面已经组织工作组到樱桃园、七道沟、大石桥等矿山协助推广。
