Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 18th: The Chinese delegation attending the Geneva Conference met on the 17th with a delegation from the French National Peace Council. The delegation consisted of Professor Bouguignon, Professor Pierre Biquard, Georges Hannot (industrialist), and Maurice Poinso Chapuis (editor of the Catholic "Bi-Weekly"). They explained to the Chinese delegation the sincere desire of the French people to stop the war in Indochina and submitted the communique issued by the Council on May 14th. The delegation also visited the delegations of the relevant countries participating in the Geneva Conference. The full text of the French National Peace Council's communique is as follows:

The French National Peace Council calls the attention of public opinion to the serious dangers of the government's policy, which disregards the lessons of eight years of devastating war and attempts to resolve the Indochina war through new military measures and preparations for internationalizing the war, that is, by using American military intervention and waging war against China. The Peace Council has been repeatedly saying, and the entire public opinion has now recognized, that the only way to achieve peace in Indochina is through sincere negotiations between the belligerent parties, not through intimidation. If successive governments had listened to us, France would have sacrificed at least 100,000 fewer soldiers' lives and 2.5 trillion francs. In Geneva, only if French diplomats truly hope to reach an acceptable agreement can they achieve such an agreement. Both sides have already announced their agreement on the principle of a ceasefire. In addition, the representatives of the Ho Chi Minh government have also suggested to France that they negotiate the issue of future participation in the French Union and the protection of our economic and cultural interests when re-establishing peace.

These suggestions must be carefully studied and discussed, rather than thinking about continuing and expanding the war.

If a state of war is replaced by cooperation and future friendship, it will restore our position and bring new hope for expanding France's influence and developing our commercial relations throughout the Far East.

The government's hostility to this solution can only be explained by motives that violate French interests and by foreign pressure.

French public opinion is unwilling to continue this war at any cost. It hopes to achieve a glorious peace in Indochina. It must make this known to those who represent national opinion. It must demand that parliamentarians not evade their responsibilities, demand that they be vigilant, and through them, further force the government to translate the national desire for peace into action.

    我国代表团接见法国和平理事会代表团
    【新华社日内瓦十八日电】出席日内瓦会议的我国代表团在十七日接见了法国全国和平理事会的代表团。该团由布吉尼翁教授，皮埃尔·毕加教授，乔治·约诺（工业家）及莫里斯·普安西良（天主教“双周刊”编辑）等四人组成。他们向我国代表团说明法国人民要求停止印度支那战争的真诚愿望，并递交该会在五月十四日所发表的公报。该代表团也访问了参加日内瓦会议的各有关国家代表团。法国全国和平理事会的公报全文如下：法国全国和平理事会要求舆论界注意政府采取的政策的严重危险性，这个政策无视八年的毁灭性的战争的教训，企图用新的军事措施和准备使战争国际化的办法来求得印度支那战争的解决，也就是说用美国进行军事干涉和对中国作战的办法来求得印度支那战争的解决。和平理事会一直在重复说，而且整个舆论界今天也已承认，要实现印度支那的和平，只能用交战双方进行真诚谈判的办法，而不能用恫吓的办法。如果历届政府听我们的话，法国就会少牺牲十万名以上的士兵的性命和二万五千亿金钱。在日内瓦，只有法国外交人员真正希望达成可以接受的协议，他们才能达成这种协议。双方都已经宣布同意停火的原则。除此以外，胡志明政府的代表还向法国建议，在重新确立和平时与法国谈判将来参加法兰西联邦的问题和保障我们的经济和文化利益的问题。
    必须认真地研究和讨论这些建议，而不要想继续进行战争和扩大战争。
    如果用合作和未来的友谊代替战争状态，那将会恢复我们的地位，并为扩大法国的影响和发展我们在整个远东的商务关系带来新的希望。
    政府敌视这种解决办法这一点只能用出于违反法国利益的动机和外国压力来解释。
    法国舆论界不愿不惜任何代价继续这个战争。它希望在印度支那实现光荣的和平。它必须使那些代表全国意见的人知道这一点。它必须要求议员们不要规避他们的责任，要求他们提高警惕，通过他们再强迫政府把全国要求和平的意愿化为行动。
