    Geneva Conference Side Notes
    American Representatives Play Deaf and Dumb
    When the Geneva Conference began, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, put forward concrete proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, embarrassing the American representatives who were trying to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In a Geneva dispatch dated April 28, the Soviet "Pravda" reporter reported the scene of the press conference held by the American delegation on April 27, saying:
      "The press conference held by the American delegation yesterday created a sad impression, even bourgeois commentators admitted. The US State Department spokesman who presided over the press conference adopted the most stupid and ridiculous tricks, hoping to avoid analysis of the proposals of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Regarding the question of whether Nam Il's speech had any new suggestions, he said that it was best to... 'not comment on Nam Il's speech'. When reporters began to insist on an answer, the US State Department spokesman said somewhat embarrassedly that his headphones seemed to be broken during Nam Il's speech. He was listening to the translation with such headphones, so he could not give any definite answer."
    The people of the world have heard the loud voice of the Korean people's representatives, but the American representatives play deaf and dumb, which is really the most stupid and ridiculous thing in the world!
      Smith's Private Visit to Bao Dai
    According to a Reuters dispatch from Geneva on May 17, on the evening of May 16, the American representative Smith visited Bao Dai, the Vietnamese puppet who lived in Evian on the French border. It is said that one of the topics of the talks between Smith and Bao Dai was the possibility of the United States training Bao Dai's puppet army, and Bao Dai immediately expressed his hope to receive "aid" directly from his American boss. Afterwards, according to Associated Press reporter Gilmore, French officials were "quite annoyed" by this matter. What made them most uneasy was Bao Dai's practice of dealing directly with the United States at this stage. Because "Bao Dai has seemed increasingly unwilling to cooperate with France in recent weeks" (Associated Press, Paris, May 15). This is one of the complex moods of the French colonists at present.
        "What Kind of Independence Is That"
    Bao Dai's delegation held a press conference on the day of their arrival in Geneva (May 6). Some reporters asked: "Does the Vietnamese delegation (referring to Bao Dai's delegation) have absolute freedom to make decisions on foreign policy?" A Bao Dai representative named Nguyen Dai Kai replied: "Now Vietnam's (Bao Dai's puppet regime) independence is absolutely complete." However, on the same day at noon, at the journalists' luncheon at the Geneva Conference, a journalist who had just come from Bao Dai's controlled area answered when asked whether Bao Dai was already independent, he said: "What kind of independence is that! Now that I have left Vietnam (Bao Dai's controlled area), I can talk about these things." The reporter said that now "more than 97 percent of the Vietnamese people support Ho Chi Minh. The problem in Vietnam lies in the withdrawal of French troops and the cessation of American aid. By then, the issue of Vietnam's independence and unification can be easily resolved."
      Two Mouthpieces
    According to an Associated Press dispatch from Geneva on May 22, the puppet representatives of Cambodia and Laos, after secretly talking with their American and French masters for a while, declared to the outside world: if anyone draws any ceasefire lines in their country, they will withdraw from the Geneva Conference and refuse to recognize the decisions of the conference. The two lackeys sounded very tough, but as long as people trace their roots, they will know who they are representing here. When the French colonists announced the "independence" of the two puppets of Cambodia and Laos in 1949, even the American bourgeois magazine "Twentieth Century" admitted: "The 'independence' proposed by France is so false that it cannot satisfy anyone." What is even more ridiculous is that at a certain press conference in Geneva, the French delegation spokesman inadvertently revealed that the two puppet representatives of Cambodia and Laos did not even know how much land and population their own country had.
    Despite the fact that these two guys are clamoring to "withdraw from the conference," it is obvious that they are just two mouthpieces of the American and French colonists.

### 日内瓦会议侧闻

    日内瓦会议侧闻
    美国代表装聋作哑
    日内瓦会议开始时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在发言中提出了关于和平解决朝鲜问题的具体建议，使企图阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的美国代表们狼狈不堪。苏联“真理报”记者在四月二十八日的日内瓦通讯中，报道四月二十七日美国代表团举行的记者招待会的情形说：
      “美国代表团昨天举行的记者招待会，造成一种令人难过的印象，甚至资产阶级的评论员也承认。主持这次记者招待会的美国国务院发言人采取了最愚蠢可笑的诡计，但愿逃避对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团建议的分析。关于南日的演说是否有新的建议这个问题，他说，最好……‘不去评论南日的演说’。当记者们开始坚持要求回答的时候，这位美国国务院的发言人好像不好意思地说，仿佛在南日发言时他的耳机坏了。他是用这样的耳机听翻译的，因此他不能给予任何确定的答复。”
    全世界人民都听到了朝鲜人民代表响亮的声音，而美国代表却装聋作哑，这真是世界上最愚蠢可笑的事情！
      史密斯私访保大
    据路透社日内瓦五月十七日电讯消息，五月十六日晚上，美国代表史密斯曾到法国边境的埃维昂去访问了住在那里的越南儡傀保大。据说史密斯和保大会谈的内容之一，是由美国训练保大伪军的可能性问题，保大当场还表示希望能直接从美国老板那里得到“援助”。事后，据美联社的记者吉尔摩说，法国官员们对这件事“颇为恼火”，他们最感不安的，是保大在目前阶段直接和美国打交道这种做法。因为“保大在最近几周中已显得越来越不大愿意和法国合作”了（美联社巴黎五月十五日电）。这就是法国殖民者目前复杂的心情之一。
        “那算什么独立”
    保大的代表团在到达日内瓦的当天（五月六日），曾举行了一次记者招待会。到会的记者有的问：“越南代表团（指保大代表团）是否有绝对自由来作出关于外交政策的决定？”，一个叫阮大凯的保大代表回答说：“现在越南（保大傀儡政权）的独立已绝对完全”。但是，就在同一天中午，在日内瓦会议的记者聚餐席上，一个刚从保大统治区来的记者回答别人问他保大是否已经独立时，他说：“那算什么独立！现在我离开了越南（保大统治区），可以讲这些话了。”这个记者说：现在“越南人民百分之九十七以上拥护胡志明，越南问题在于法军的撤退与美国的停止援助，到那时候越南的独立与统一问题便可迎刃而解了”。
      两个传声筒
    据美联社日内瓦五月二十二日电讯消息，高棉和寮国两个傀儡代表同他们的美国和法国主子，鬼鬼祟祟地谈了一阵之后，对外扬言：如果谁在他们国内划出任何停战线来，他们就要退出日内瓦会议，拒绝承认会议的决定。两个奴才口气倒满硬，但人们只要追查一下他们的根底，就会知道他们究竟是代表谁在这里说话的了。在一九四九年法国殖民者宣布高棉和寮国两个傀儡“独立”的时候，连美国资产阶级的“二十世纪”杂志也承认：“法国建议的‘独立’是如此虚假，以致它不可能使任何人感到满意”。更可笑的是，在日内瓦某次记者招待会上，法国代表团发言人无意之间泄露：高棉和寮国两个傀儡代表，连他们本国有多少土地和人口都不知道。
    尽管这两个家伙胡嚷什么要“退出会议”，但是很显然，他们不过是美、法殖民者的两个传声筒而已。
