Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 6th: Major European newspapers on the 5th prominently featured the arrival of the delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Geneva. The French newspaper "L'Humanité" stated that seeing Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong and his party disembark from the plane gave people the feeling that the Geneva Conference had taken a big step forward. Geneva's "La Voix Ouvrière" said that the participation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's delegation in the Geneva Conference was another failure of America's "policy of strength" and a new and important victory for the forces of peace.

On the same day as the arrival of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's delegation, the French National Assembly reconvened after the Easter holiday. The Indochina issue was again the focus of attention for the parliamentarians. As the Geneva Conference is about to enter the stage of discussing the Indochina issue, the French people's desire to break away from the war policy of following the United States and demand the restoration of peace in Indochina was once again reflected in the parliament. Former member of the Popular Republican Movement, André Denis, questioned Laniel, saying, "The whole country hopes to end the war. The government's silence is incomprehensible. ...You have a responsibility to explain your meeting with Dulles." On the 4th, the Paris newspaper "Combat's" editorial's farewell message to Dulles, who quietly left the meeting, was: "We don't say goodbye, but: farewell forever." On the 5th, the Paris newspaper "Libération's" summary of the speeches made by parliamentarians of various parties in the parliament on the 4th was: an immediate ceasefire in Indochina "is the heartfelt desire of all members of the National Assembly." "L'Humanité" said that the French people's unanimous desire to end the Indochina war is not only reflected in the parliamentarians' speeches, but also spreading within the government.

According to French journalists here, recently many French people's delegations have come to Geneva to request the French delegation to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Indochina war at the Geneva Conference. Bidault's residence in Geneva has been constantly receiving telegrams and letters from all over France demanding an immediate ceasefire and peaceful negotiations. French newspapers have recently published many such letters and telegrams. For example, the people of Chabanais county said in their letter to Bidault: "We hope that the French delegation will defend France's interests in Geneva, and the French delegation must act in accordance with the desire to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace. First of all, we demand an end to the bloodshed in Indochina through an immediate ceasefire..."

Now, with the arrival of the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the start of the stage of the Geneva Conference to discuss the Indochina issue is already in sight. Regarding the issue of members participating in the discussion of restoring peace in Indochina, thanks to the peaceful sincerity of the Chinese and Soviet delegations, especially Foreign Minister Molotov's off-site efforts, an agreement was reached last weekend. In this way, the conspiracy of some powerful people in the United States who have been clamoring to expand the Indochina war, that they would "not negotiate with the Viet Minh representatives," has been completely bankrupted. The Geneva Conference must reach an agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. This has been the unanimous demand of French newspapers from left to right for a long time.

However, in the process of discussing this issue, it cannot be said that there are not many obstacles. On the eve of Dulles's dismal departure, he also relayed Eisenhower's letter to him, which mentioned that the United States' firm attitude on the Indochina issue remained unchanged, to Bidault to cheer him up; after Dulles returned to Washington, Eisenhower announced that "plans are underway to implement security measures in Southeast Asia." Mrs. Tabouis, a reporter for the Paris newspaper "Le Journal," said on the 5th that the US delegation will do its best to promote the realization of the so-called West Pacific Treaty Organization group, including the three Indochinese puppets, while the Geneva Conference discusses the Indochina issue. This well-informed reporter also said that none of the US representatives believe that a ceasefire in Indochina is possible. When an American representative was asked what would happen if France agreed to a ceasefire, he replied, "It cannot be said that Bao Dai will also agree." These signs alone are enough to make people who yearn for the success of the Geneva Conference more vigilant.

### 法国舆论普遍愿望在印度支那实现和平  要求法政府不再继续追随美国的战争政策

    法国舆论普遍愿望在印度支那实现和平
    要求法政府不再继续追随美国的战争政策
    【新华社日内瓦六日电】五日欧洲各大报都以显著地位登载了越南民主共和国代表团到达日内瓦的消息。法国“人道报”称，当人们看到范文同副总理兼代理外长一行下飞机时，都感觉到日内瓦会议已前进了一大步。日内瓦的“工人之声报”说：越南民主共和国代表团参加日内瓦会议是美国“实力”政策的又一次失败，和平力量的一个新的重要胜利。
    和越南民主共和国代表团抵此同日，法国国民议会于复活节假期后复会。印度支那问题又是议员们注意的中心。当日内瓦会议将进入讨论印度支那问题阶段的时候，法国人民力争摆脱追随美国的战争政策和要求恢复印度支那和平的愿望又一次在议会中获得了反映。前属人民共和党议员安德烈·德尼质问拉尼埃说：“全国一致希望结束战争，政府的静默不能理解。……你有责任来解释你和杜勒斯的见面。”四日巴黎“战斗报”的社论给悄然离会的杜勒斯的临别赠言是：“我们不向你说再见，而是：永别了。”五日巴黎“解放报”对四日在议会上各党派议员的发言所作的总结是：印度支那立即停火“是国民议会所有议员衷心渴望的”。“人道报”说，法国人民要求结束印度支那战争的一致愿望不但反映在议员们的发言中，也蔓延到政府的内部。
    据此间法国记者说：日前有好些法国人民的代表团来到日内瓦，向法国代表团要求在日内瓦会议上获得印度支那战争的和平解决。皮杜尔在日内瓦的寓所不断收到许多从法国各地送来要求立即停战与和平协商的电报和信件。法国报纸近日来登了许多这类函电。例如夏巴内县人民给皮杜尔的信里说：“我们希望法国代表团在日内瓦捍卫法国的利益，法国代表团必须依照缓和国际紧张形势和巩固世界和平的愿望行事。首先，我们要求通过立即停火来停止印度支那的流血……。”
    现在由于越南民主共和国代表的到达，日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题阶段的开始已经在望。关于参加恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论的成员问题，由于中、苏两国代表团的和平诚意，特别是莫洛托夫外长的会外努力，已于上周末达成协议。这样，一直在叫嚣扩大印度支那战争的美国有势力人士所谓“不和越盟代表谈判”的阴谋已经完全破产。日内瓦会议一定要对恢复印度支那和平问题取得协议，这是好久以来从左派到右派的法国报纸一致的要求。
    但是，在讨论这个问题的过程中，还不能说没有很多的阻力。杜勒斯黯然离此前夕，还把艾森豪威尔给他的、其中提到美国在印度支那问题上的坚决态度不变的信转告皮杜尔，为皮杜尔打气；杜勒斯回华盛顿后，艾森豪威尔又宣布“正进行着实现东南亚安全措施的计划”。巴黎“新闻报”记者塔布伊夫人五日说：美国代表团在日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的同时，将竭力促成包括印度支那三个傀儡的所谓西太平洋公约集团的实现。这位消息灵通的记者又说：美国代表之中没有人认为在印度支那停战是可能的。一位美国代表被问到如果法国同意停战的话怎么办时，回答说：“这不能说保大也将同意。”仅仅这些迹象就足够使渴望日内瓦会议成功的人们要更加警惕了。
