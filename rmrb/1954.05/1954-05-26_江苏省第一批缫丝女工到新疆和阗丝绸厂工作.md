The first group of silk-reeling women workers from Jiangsu Province departed for Xinjiang at the end of last month to work at the newly built Hotan Silk Factory.

The group consists of seventy-three silk-reeling women workers, some of whom are skilled young workers from various silk factories in Wuxi City, many of whom are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Others are young people who have passed strict examinations. During more than three months of technical training, they learned and mastered the basic techniques of silk reeling.

Before their departure, textile workers in Wuxi City held a grand farewell meeting. At the meeting, the chairman of the Wuxi Textile Workers' Union and the deputy director of the Women Workers' Department of the Wuxi Federation of Trade Unions, in their speeches, encouraged them to unite closely with the fraternal ethnic groups in Xinjiang, learn modestly, continue to improve their skills, and contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland's frontier. Shao Huizhen, a silk-reeling woman worker from the Wuxi No. 3 Silk Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, represented the comrades going to Xinjiang at the meeting, saying: We will resolutely overcome all difficulties and complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party. At the railway station, they were warmly seen off by hundreds of workers and their families.
