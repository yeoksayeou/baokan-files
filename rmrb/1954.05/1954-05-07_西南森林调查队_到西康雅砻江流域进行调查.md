The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee and the Forestry Bureau of the Agricultural and Forestry Department of Xikang Province jointly formed a forest survey team of more than 130 people in April. They were divided into three teams and sent to the Yalong River Basin in Xikang Province to conduct a forest survey. This year, they will comprehensively and systematically investigate the forest area, reserves, growth, and general transportation conditions of six counties in the lower reaches of the Yalong River, including the Muli Tibetan Autonomous Region and Jin Mine, and conduct a general survey of the forest resources of seven counties in the upper reaches of the Yalong River, including Qianning and Litang. Before departure, the survey team concentrated on studying the advanced Soviet experience in forest surveying and added precision instruments such as theodolites, telescopes, and compasses.

Xikang is one of the main forest areas in China. After the trees are surveyed and felled, they can directly support the basic construction of the interior. Last year and the year before, the Xikang Forest Survey Team and the Southwest Forest Survey Team completed the survey of the forests in the Dadu River and Qingyi River in Xikang and conducted a partial general survey of the Yalong River Basin. According to the survey results, the forest reserves are very abundant. Most of them are excellent building materials and railway sleeper materials. The trees are generally one to two hundred years old, and most of the tree trunks are more than one and a half feet in diameter. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西南森林调查队
    到西康雅砻江流域进行调查
    西南行政委员会农林局和西康省农林厅林业局，在四月间联合组成一百三十多人的森林调查队，分成三个分队，前往西康省境内雅砻江流域进行森林调查。他们今年全面系统地调查雅砻江下游木里藏族自治区、金矿等六县的森林面积、蓄积、生长情况和一般运输情况等，并对雅砻江上游乾宁、理塘等七县森林资源进行概况踏查。出发前，调查队曾集中学习了苏联关于森林调查的先进经验，并新添置了经纬仪和望远镜、罗盘仪等精密仪器。
    西康是我国主要的森林区之一，林木经过调查砍伐后，可以直接支援内地的基本建设。去年和前年，西康森林调查队和西南森林调查队已调查完了西康境内大渡河和青衣江的森林，并在雅砻江流域作了局部的概况踏查。根据调查的结果，证明该地森林蓄积极丰富，大部分是优良的建筑用材和铁路枕木用材，树龄一般有一、二百年，大多数的树身直径在一尺五寸以上。　（新华社）
