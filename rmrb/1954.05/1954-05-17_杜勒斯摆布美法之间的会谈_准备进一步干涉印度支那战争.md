Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 16th (TASS dispatch): Agence France-Presse, citing well-informed sources, reports that Dulles and Laniel are scheduled to confer soon in Paris regarding the current situation in Indochina and its future development.

    U.S. Ambassador to France, Dillon, met with Laniel on the 14th to arrange this consultation. He also went to Geneva to confer with Bidault.

    According to a report by a United Press International reporter, well-informed diplomatic sources in Washington say that France has requested the United States to hold high-level talks on the Indochina situation as quickly as possible. The UPI reporter pointed out that, according to well-informed sources, the United States has agreed to discuss "the conditions that must be met before the U.S. government considers military intervention in Indochina," which the United States has consistently insisted upon. The US-French talks are set to begin "immediately."

    The UPI reporter continued, Dulles notified French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet on May 12th that the United States agreed to consider the conditions for U.S. intervention in the Indochina War.

    De Pre, the Washington correspondent for the Paris newspaper "L'Aurore," reports that, at the request of Paris, the United States, as one party, and France and the three associated states (Bao Dai's Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia) as the other party, will soon begin talks.

    These talks will be at the ministerial level. The talks may begin in Paris, or even in Geneva, as U.S. Undersecretary of State Smith, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and the Foreign Ministers of Bao Dai's Vietnam, the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Kingdom of Laos are all in Geneva.

    杜勒斯摆布美法之间的会谈
    准备进一步干涉印度支那战争
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：法国新闻社自消息灵通人士方面获悉：杜勒斯和拉尼埃不久就要在巴黎就印度支那的现况及其发展前途进行商谈。
    美国驻法国大使狄龙为了安排这次商谈，在十四日曾与拉尼埃会谈。他并到日内瓦去和皮杜尔进行会商。
    据合众社记者报道，华盛顿消息灵通的外交人士说，法国要求美国尽速就印度支那局势问题举行高级会谈。合众社记者指出，据消息灵通人士说，美国同意和法国讨论“在美国政府考虑对印度支那进行军事干涉以前必须履行的条件”，而这是美国一向坚持的。美国和法国的会谈“马上”就要开始。
    合众社记者继续写道，杜勒斯已于五月十二日通知法国驻美国大使庞纳，说美国同意考虑美国干涉印度支那战争的条件。
    巴黎“震旦报”驻华盛顿记者德普里报道：根据巴黎的请求，美国作为一方以及法国和三个联邦成员国（保大越南、寮国王国和高棉王国）作为另一方，不久就要开始举行会谈。
    这次会谈将是部长一级的会谈。会谈可能在巴黎开始，甚至可能在日内瓦开始，因为美国副国务卿史密斯、法国外交部长皮杜尔和保大越南外交部长、高棉王国和寮国王国的外交大臣都在日内瓦。
