Xinhua News Agency report:

    The construction of the Meishan Reservoir project on the upper reaches of the Shi River, a tributary of the Huai River, has officially begun. This will be the reservoir with the largest water storage capacity among all the reservoirs on the Huai River.
    Between the Greater and Lesser Meishan Mountains in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, the remote valley has now become unprecedentedly lively. More than two thousand workers participating in the construction of the reservoir project have arrived at the construction site one after another. Workers from the mechanical construction team will excavate a tunnel more than 240 meters long at the foot of the mountain on the east bank of the Shi River. The workers have begun to attack the rocks. The roaring sound of the mountain opener and the sound of explosives blasting rocks have driven away the leopards and wild boars living in the mountains. A large amount of equipment needed for the construction of the reservoir has been transported from Jinan, Zhengzhou, and the Foziling Reservoir construction site to the construction site by water and land. In order to build the Meishan Reservoir, a gravel road more than 150 li long has been specially built from Lu'an to Meishan.
    The Meishan Reservoir is the seventh reservoir built in the Huai River Harnessing Project and the second large reservoir built in Anhui Province after the Foziling Reservoir. In the past three years, four reservoirs, including the Shimantan, Banqiao, Baisha, and Boshan reservoirs, have been completed in the upper reaches of the Huai River. The Nanwan Reservoir in Henan Province and the Foziling Reservoir in Anhui Province are now under intense construction.
    The Meishan Reservoir is built on the upper reaches of the Shi River, a tributary of the Huai River. The Shi River is a fierce and violent river that meanders down from the Dabie Mountains and flows into the Huai River at Sanhejian, where Gushi County in Henan Province and Huoqiu County in Anhui Province meet. After every heavy rain, the turbulent river water of the Shi River is like ten thousand horses galloping, with a maximum flow of more than 4,600 cubic meters per second. However, in the dry season, the minimum flow of this river is less than one cubic meter per second. The uncontrolled floods of the Shi River, which rise and fall sharply, not only cause serious water and drought disasters to the farmers along the river but also seriously affect the water level of the Huai River main stream, often easily causing floods on both sides of the Huai River main stream. In order to control the floods in the upper reaches of the Shi River, the Huai River Harnessing Leadership decided to build a Meishan Reservoir between the Greater and Lesser Meishan Mountains, more than 20 kilometers south of Jinzhai County, Anhui Province.
    One of the main projects of the Meishan Reservoir is the construction of a reinforced concrete arch dam. This is the second huge arch dam built in New China after the Foziling Reservoir. The dam is 66.5 meters high, the crest is 292.5 meters long, the bottom is about 94 meters wide, and a total of 120,000 cubic meters of concrete needs to be poured. This is a large-scale and highly technical project. If compared to a three-meter-high building, the height of the dam is about the same as a 20-story building. More than 40 kinds of machines will be used in the construction. The lifting equipment for pouring concrete can transport 0.4 cubic meters of concrete mixed on the ground to a height of more than 60 meters in just one minute each time.
    In addition to the arch dam, the main project of the Meishan Reservoir will also involve excavating a tunnel about 243 meters long at the foot of the mountain on the east bank of the Shi River. This tunnel can be used for diversion during the construction period and will be used to discharge floodwater after the reservoir is completed. The tunnel is eight meters in diameter and can discharge 480 cubic meters of water per second. An overflow channel 180 meters long will also be opened on the hilltop on the east bank of the arch dam, ready to discharge water in the event of extreme floods to ensure the safety of the arch dam. In addition, a hydroelectric power station will be built below the arch dam.
    The Meishan Reservoir is a multi-purpose water conservancy project that benefits many aspects. The Meishan Reservoir can store 1.08 billion cubic meters of water. After the reservoir is completed, the fierce floods in the upper reaches of the Shi River will be tamed through the gate and completely under human control. The flow of more than 4,600 cubic meters per second of the Shi River will be reduced to 480 cubic meters per second in Meishan. In this way, not only will the areas on both sides of the Shi River above Gushi be free from floods from now on, but also the water level of the Huai River main stream can be lowered and stabilized. The floodwater stored in the reservoir can be used to irrigate 640,000 mu of farmland in the middle and lower reaches of the Shi River. In the future, the Meishan Reservoir hydroelectric power station, when completed, will form a power grid with the Foziling Reservoir hydroelectric power station, providing a large amount of electricity for the development of industrial and agricultural production. The appearance of Shi River shipping will also be greatly changed due to the completion of the Meishan Reservoir, and wooden boats with a load of 50 tons can navigate freely on the Shi River. The rich local products and special products of the Dabie Mountain area, such as tea, hemp, bamboo, and wood, can be transported out more conveniently and continuously. The Meishan Reservoir is a beautiful artificial lake, and a large number of freshwater fish can also be bred in the lake. In the future, with green trees lining the lake, wild birds flying over the lake, and sails dotted, Meishan will become a very beautiful scenic spot. This reservoir is expected to play a role in blocking floods during the summer flood season next year, and the construction of the reservoir is striving to be completed by the end of next year.

### 治淮工程中的梅山水库正式兴工

    治淮工程中的梅山水库正式兴工
    淮河支流史河上游兴建的梅山水库工程，已正式开始施工。这将是淮河各水库中蓄水最多的一个水库。
    在安徽省金寨县境的大小梅山之间，偏僻的山谷现在空前热闹起来。参加建造水库工程的二千多工人已陆续赶到工地。机械建筑队的工人，将在史河东岸的山下开凿一条二百四十多公尺长的隧洞。工人们已开始向岩石发动进攻，开山机隆隆的吼叫声和炸药爆炸岩石的响声，把居住在山间的山豹和野猪都赶跑了。修建水库需用的大量器材已从济南、郑州、佛子岭水库工地由水陆两路运向工地。为了建造梅山水库，从六安到梅山已专门筑好一条一百五十多里长的石子公路。
    梅山水库是根治淮河工程中建造的第七个水库，是安徽省继佛子岭水库之后建造的第二座大水库。三年多来淮河上游已建成石漫滩、板桥、白沙、薄山等四座水库。现在正在紧张施工的有河南省的南湾水库和安徽省的佛子岭水库。
    梅山水库建造在淮河支流史河的上游，史河是条凶猛暴躁的河流，它从大别山区蜿蜒而下，到河南省固始县和安徽省霍邱县分界处的三河尖注入淮河。每逢大雨之后，史河湍急的河水有如万马奔腾，最大流量达四千六百多秒公方。可是一到枯水季节，这条河的最低流量还不到一个秒公方。暴涨暴落没有控制的史河洪水，不仅使沿河两岸农民遭受到严重的水旱灾害，而且使淮河干流的水位受到严重影响，常易酿成淮河干流两岸的水灾。为了控制史河上游的洪水，治淮领导机关决定在安徽省金寨县以南二十多公里的大小梅山之间建造一座梅山水库。
    梅山水库的主要工程之一，是建筑一座钢筋混凝土的连拱坝。这是新中国继佛子岭水库之后建造的第二座巨大的连拱坝。这座连拱坝坝身高六十六点五公尺，坝顶全长二百九十二点五公尺，坝底宽大约九十四公尺，共需浇筑十二万公方混凝土。这是个规模巨大技术性很高的工程。如果拿三公尺一层的楼房来作比较，坝的高度大约有一幢二十层楼房那样高。施工中采用的机器将有四十多种。浇筑混凝土的升高设备，每次只要一分钟的时间就可以把在地面上拌好的零点四公方混凝土运到六十公尺以上的高空。
    梅山水库主要工程除连拱坝之外，将在史河东岸的山下开凿一条长约二百四十三公尺的隧洞。这个隧洞在施工期内可用来导流，在水库完成后将用来排泄洪水。隧洞的直径有八公尺长，每秒钟可排泄四百八十立方公尺的水。连拱坝东岸的山头上，还将开一条一百八十公尺长的溢洪道，准备在发生非常洪水时放水以保证连拱坝的安全。另外，在连拱坝的下面，将建一座水力发电站。
    梅山水库是个多目标兴利的水利工程。梅山水库可蓄水十亿零八千万立方公尺。水库建成后，史河上游凶猛的洪水将驯服地通过闸门，完全处于人力的控制之下。史河四千六百多秒公方的流量，在梅山将减到四百八十秒公方。这样，就不仅使固始以上的史河两岸从此消除了水灾，而且也可降低和稳定淮河干流的水位。水库里拦蓄的洪水可以用来灌溉史河中游和下游六十四万亩农田。将来建成的梅山水库水力发电站将和佛子岭水库水力发电站结成一个电力网，为发展工业生产和农业生产供应大量电力。史河航运的面貌也将因梅山水库的建成而大大改观，载重五十吨的木船可以在史河上自由航行。大别山区的茶、麻、竹、木材等富饶的土产和特产可以更加便利地源源运出。梅山水库是个美丽的人造湖，湖内还可以繁殖大量的淡水鱼类。将来湖畔绿树成荫，湖上野鸟飞翔，风帆点点，梅山将成为一个十分幽美的风景区。这个水库预计在明年夏汛期间起拦蓄洪水的作用，水库的建造工程争取在明年年底全部竣工。　（据新华社讯）
