    More Than Twenty Factories and Mines in Taiyuan Hold Party Representative Meetings

    Twenty-two factories and mines in Taiyuan have already held Party representative meetings, and seven units, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, are preparing to convene Party representative meetings. At the Party representative meetings, each factory and mine carried out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, focusing on exposing and criticizing the phenomena of arrogance and complacency and decentralism among Party member cadres. Some units also exposed and criticized the disharmony among the main responsible cadres at the Party representative meetings. For example, the three Party member factory directors of the Ximing Coking Plant each acted in their own way, making it impossible to implement the Party's resolutions. At the meetings, these bourgeois individualistic ideas were severely criticized. In order to fully promote democracy, proposals were widely solicited, and the vast majority of these proposals criticized the leadership's neglect of political and ideological work and bureaucratic work styles. To strengthen the leadership of the meetings, members of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party participated in the meetings of various units. Many units, through examination and arrangements at the Party representative meetings, deployed the tasks for this year. A small number of units also elected Party committees. These meetings basically achieved the purpose of strengthening Party unity and further implementing the general line.

    太原市二十多个厂矿举行党代表会议
    太原市已有二十二个厂矿单位举行了党代表会议，太原钢铁厂等七个单位正在准备召开党代表会议。在党代表会议上，各厂矿都开展了自下而上的批评和自我批评，集中揭发和批判了党员干部中存在的骄傲自满情绪和分散主义的现象。也有的单位在党代表会上揭发和批判了主要负责干部间闹不团结现象。如西铭焦炭厂三个党员厂长，各自为政，使党的决议无法贯彻。会上对这些资产阶级个人主义思想，进行了深刻批判。为充分发扬民主，普遍征集了提案，这些提案，极大部分都是批判领导方面忽视政治思想工作和官僚主义的作风的。为加强对会议的领导，中共太原市委员会委员分头参加了各单位的会议。许多单位在党代表会上通过检查布置了今年的任务。少数单位还选举了党委员会。这些会议基本上达到了增强党的团结和进一步贯彻总路线的目的。　　　　　　　　（鲁生）
