To reduce the burden on readers, the state-owned People's Publishing House is actively improving book design to increase paper utilization and lower the price of some books.

In the past, when printing larger works in 25-open format (such as works of Marxism-Leninism), the People's Publishing House mostly used newsprint that was 31 inches wide and 43 inches long. However, this paper was not suitable for the 25-open format. Cutting the paper resulted in five scattered pages, which had to be glued by hand during hardcover binding. This increased labor hours and costs, and easily led to missing or duplicated pages, and significant paper waste. After studying these situations, the People's Publishing House decided to use newsprint that was 33.5 inches wide and 46 inches long to print 32-open format books, which are roughly the same size as the 25-open format. This reduced costs and improved the printing quality of the books. For example, the "Das Kapital" used to be priced at 150,000 yuan per copy, but after this reform, the price per copy (paper cover with cloth spine) was reduced to 100,000 yuan; "The Great Soviet Union" was reduced from 30,000 yuan per copy to 24,000 yuan.

While reforming the format, the People's Publishing House also paid attention to the reform of page layout design. Before the manuscript is typeset and after the first proof is produced, it is carefully redesigned. Based on the nature of the book, and without affecting eye health and aesthetics, the length of the book is appropriately controlled, unnecessary blank pages are reduced, the page size is enlarged, and the space between lines is appropriately reduced. This greatly increases the number of words on each page. A book of 100,000 words can be reduced by about 20% in length after redesign. For example, Chen Boda's "Yuan Shikai, the Thieving Usurper," which was recently published, was reduced from 120 pages to 80 pages after redesign, saving 28% of paper.

The Central People's Government Publishing Administration is now gradually promoting this advanced experience to central-level publishing houses.

### 减低书籍成本，提高印制质量  人民出版社改进书籍设计工作

    减低书籍成本，提高印制质量
    人民出版社改进书籍设计工作
    国营人民出版社为减轻读者的负担，积极改进书籍的设计工作，以提高纸张的利用率，降低部分书籍的售价。
    人民出版社过去印制二十五开本的较大著作（如马克思列宁主义著作）时，大都采用宽三十一吋、长四十三吋的新闻纸，而这种纸张不适用于二十五开本，裁纸一张就有五个零散的页子，精装时必须用手工粘糊。这样就增加了工时和成本，并且容易发生缺页、重页等现象，纸边的浪费也很大。人民出版社在研究了这些情况后，决定改用宽三十三点五吋长四十六吋的新闻纸来印行三十二开本的书籍，它和二十五开本的形式大体相同。这就减低了成本，提高了书籍的印制质量。例如，“资本论”过去每部定价为十五万元，经过这次改革，每部（纸面布脊）的定价降到十万元；“伟大的苏联”由每本三万元降到两万四千元。
    在改革开本的同时，人民出版社还注意到版式设计工作的改革。原稿在发排前和排出初校样后，都重新加以周密设计，根据书籍的性质，在不影响目力健康和美观的原则下，适当控制书的篇幅，减少不必要的空白面，放大版面，并适当地缩小行间的空白处。这样使每一张纸的容字量大大增多。一本十万字的书籍经过重新设计后，可缩减百分之二十左右的篇幅。如最近出版的陈伯达著“窃国大盗袁世凯”，经重新设计后，全书从原来的一百二十面减到八十面，节约用纸达百分之二十八。
    现在，中央人民政府出版总署已逐步向中央一级出版社推广这一先进经验。
