Factory-Run Schools
Shanxi Provincial People's Government Illiteracy Elimination Committee
Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions
    Since 1949, the Yangquan Iron Factory in Shanxi Province has been running spare-time schools for workers. Initially, less than 200 people participated in the study. By early 1951, this had grown to 1,560 people, accounting for 93% of the factory's total workers at the time. However, it did not develop steadily and the integration with production and various central movements was very poor, so it always started and then collapsed. From July 1951 to June 1952, classes were suspended for a whole year. When school reopened in June 1952, it closed again in less than four months. In August 1952, the factory ran an experimental crash literacy class, but due to frequent shift changes and excessive meetings on the production side, study time could not be guaranteed, and this experimental class soon collapsed.
    In 1953, the state began planned economic construction. Due to the needs of production, workers had an even stronger desire to learn culture. However, the organizational form of the spare-time school's teaching still could not adapt to the characteristics of production. Furthermore, the connection between the school and the administrative side was not close. Whenever there was a central movement or shift change, either the school was suspended or the attendance rate of the workshop was reduced, affecting both learning and production. Thus, the workers' learning needs still could not be met. At that time, a sentence was popular among the workers, reflecting the feelings of the vast majority of employees: "Attending 'spare-time school' every year, reciting the same book every year, and never graduating."
    What were the reasons why the Yangquan Iron Factory's spare-time school for workers was not run well? The main reasons were: first, the leadership did not pay enough attention to workers' spare-time cultural education; second, it did not run the school according to the principle of "obeying production and voluntary participation by the masses." The workshop leadership and the spare-time school both viewed production and learning as opposites. Cadres in the spare-time school unilaterally emphasized learning, while cadres in the workshop unilaterally emphasized production, so conflicts often occurred. For example, sometimes workers were in class, but the workshop insisted on pulling them to attend meetings; also, the workshop and the school did not communicate about shift changes, which often squeezed out learning time.
    How to put workers' spare-time cultural education on a normal development track, so as to meet the workers' cultural learning needs and adapt to the needs of production development? The leadership of the Yangquan Iron Factory increasingly felt that this problem had to be solved.
    Last April, when repairing the blast furnace, the working hours of the repair workshop were changed to three shifts. With the change in work and rest times, many workers were unable to study and dropped out of the crash course. At that time, the repair workshop had a total of 312 employees, of whom about 125 were illiterate or semi-literate, all of whom urgently requested to learn culture. They did not want their studies to be abandoned halfway because of the change in work and rest times. Therefore, they proposed the suggestion of "factory-run school" to the leadership. The workshop leadership also began to feel that if the workers' cultural learning was not done well, it would limit the continuous improvement of the workers' political awareness, and their enthusiasm for production could not be fully utilized. Therefore, after carefully considering the workers' rationalization proposals, it was decided to run the school in the workshop. First, 34 workers in the workshop who recognized about three to four hundred characters were organized into a class to teach the second book of Chinese and arithmetic (hereinafter referred to as the Second Book Class). This class started in May. The teaching business of the class was led by the teaching and research section of the spare-time school, and the public miscellaneous expenses were paid from the spare-time school's funds. The study time was flexibly arranged under the principle of obeying production: learning culture on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and attending political class on Saturdays. After three months, the results were very good, so 40 illiterate people were organized into a class to study the first book of Chinese and arithmetic (hereinafter referred to as the First Book Class).
    The cultural study class of the repair workshop was thus set up. Because it was led by the workshop's Party committee, relying on the masses and giving play to the wisdom of the masses, the workers loved it very much. The workers used all conditions to adapt learning to production and life. For example, there were no special classrooms for classes, so they used the idle workshops in the morning - the workrooms of the riveters and construction teams - as fixed classrooms. During class, as long as a blackboard was hung up and wooden boards were set up, it became a ready-made "desk." All administrative affairs within the class were managed by the students themselves. The workshop's trade union led everyone's learning through the class leader. In order to facilitate mutual assistance in learning, learning groups were divided according to production teams based on everyone's opinions. In addition, they also established a roll call, spot check, commendation, and criticism system. Because the students were all in the same workshop, everyone knew who was absent from class without reason, who was often late, and who was lazy in learning, so criticism could be carried out well. In addition, the results of spot checks were announced every week, so the learning discipline was always very good, the student attendance rate was very high, and the students maintained a full learning mood.
    The teachers were selected and hired by the workers from the staff. Because the staff were more familiar with the workers' lives, thoughts, and production situation, it was easier to relate to reality in teaching. In the past, spare-time schools adopted a large-scale class system, with students from various workshops in one class. It was difficult for teachers to take care of everyone when giving an example, and often some understood while others didn't. Factory-run schools solved this problem because the examples given were all things familiar to everyone in the workshop, and everyone understood. Factory-run schools also facilitated "combining with production needs" and achieving "learning and application." For example, the Chinese teacher of the Second Book Class appropriately taught the students to practice writing short practical documents, such as notes, work reports, and rationalization proposals, according to the students' requirements, which was very popular among the workers and the teaching effect was also very good. Student Shi Shiwen initially regarded writing as very mysterious. The teacher wrote what he said at the opening ceremony on the blackboard, saying that this was a good article, which greatly improved Shi Shiwen's and other students' confidence in learning to write. Shi Shiwen could only write one or two short sentences when he started practicing writing, but by August last year, he could write articles of three to five hundred words. For example, arithmetic, for the workers in the repair workshop, was something they could not do without, even when receiving raw materials, they had to calculate. Therefore, according to the needs of the workers, the arithmetic class appropriately increased application problems. Workers could do mental arithmetic, but could not write down the formula. The teacher explained the method of writing down the formula. After the workers understood the principle, they could calculate more complex arithmetic problems in their work.
    Because factory-run schools can combine with practice, the teaching effect is good. As of the end of 1953, the progress was: the Second Book Class had a total of six months of classes, Chinese for 75 hours, completed a Second Book textbook, arithmetic for 37 hours, from integer addition to multiplication; the First Book Class had three months of classes, a total of 54 hours, Chinese completed 18 lessons, arithmetic reached integer subtraction. The results were: 60% of the students in the Second Book Class could write short articles of two to three hundred words, and 27 students had developed the habit of writing weekly journals; in terms of arithmetic, they could generally calculate four arithmetic application problems, and some students learned to calculate decimal problems through self-study, catching up with the teacher's course progress. Students in the First Book Class generally recognized about 200 new words, and some students exceeded this number, and could write several short sentences coherently; in arithmetic, they could all calculate addition and subtraction, and individual students could also calculate multiplication and division.
    After the workers initially mastered the written language, they used it in production. For example, Feng Chengwei, a construction worker with 21 years of work experience, had studied "Zhao Qian Sun Li" for three winters when he was a child and knew one or two hundred characters. This time, he participated in the Second Book Class for more than half a year, and was able to preliminarily apply the knowledge he learned to production. Last year, the factory sent him to lead 40 workers to build the feeding bridge from the raw material section of the iron smelting workshop to the blast furnace, stipulating that this project should be completed in 50 days with 2,040 worker days and 60 transport worker days. After accepting the task, he recorded the work plan in his notebook and kept a daily work log. His notebook also had a roll call sheet to record the daily attendance of the workers; he recorded the workers' performance in his notebook, and frequently carried out commendations and criticisms based on this; in addition, he recorded the collected opinions of the masses and rationalization proposals in his notebook. After the project was completed, he wrote a work report of more than 180 words, reporting that the bridge construction project was completed 39 days ahead of schedule with the efforts of all the workers, and saved 110 worker days. Feng Chengwei often carries his small notebook with him, saying, "Now I really can't work without it." For example, Zhang Fuquan, a forger, cannot do without measuring the diameter to find the circumference in his work. Because he could not calculate, he used an inaccurate "native method" in the past: measuring the diameter and then winding the circumference with a rope to measure the length of the circumference. Later, someone told him an approximate calculation method. He knew at the time that this method was not accurate enough, and the accurate calculation of the circumference should be "diameter multiplied by three point one four one six," but he could not calculate multiplication, so he had to use this approximate method to calculate for several years. This time, he participated in the Second Book Class and learned decimal multiplication, so the problem of calculating the circumference was successfully solved, and he was very happy.
    The experience of the repair workshop spread quickly.
    The Yangquan Iron Factory has four workshops: iron smelting, repair, refractory, and supply and marketing. In addition to the repair workshop, the cultural learning of other workshops has also been seriously affected due to frequent shift changes and large changes in production time, and there is a spontaneous phenomenon of "three days of fishing and two days of drying the net." Since the repair workshop's experiment in factory-run schools was successful, the refractory workshop also started school at the end of August last year. They divided the workers into three classes, A, B, and C, according to their level. The leadership of the refractory workshop attached great importance to these three classes. When formulating quarterly plans, they included learning as one of the important contents. When encountering shift changes, they could also appropriately arrange study time so that it would not be affected. According to statistics in January this year, the number of participants in the workshop had reached 149 (including those participating in spare-time school), accounting for 80% of the total number of employees in the workshop.
    After the success of the repair workshop and the refractory workshop in running schools, the supply and marketing workshop is also preparing to run schools. The supply and marketing workshop is divided into four sections: procurement, finished products, transportation, and warehouse. The production time changes even more, so running schools in the workshop is the most suitable. The workers have obtained the consent of the factory to clean up several old warehouse rooms as classrooms, and they are ready to start school as soon as possible.
    The workers' spare-time cultural education work in the repair workshop and the refractory workshop of the Yangquan Iron Factory has now embarked on a path of steady development. As mentioned above, we can see that factory-run schools have two significant characteristics: first, it conforms to the principle of "obeying production and voluntary participation by the masses." Without encroaching on production time and without hindering production, "factory-run schools" can flexibly change study time and teaching organization forms, so that workers' cultural learning can be guaranteed and not affected by production; the teaching content can also be closely combined with production, appropriately linking production and life. Second, the method of factory-run schools was first proposed by the workers in the repair workshop based on their own production situation and learning requirements, and then gradually promoted to various workshops after the experiment was successful. Therefore, its development is based on the conscious and voluntary basis of the masses, and its organizational form and teaching methods can adapt to the production and living conditions of the masses and meet the learning requirements of the workers. Therefore, it can be said that this is a method of running schools that follows the mass line.

    车间办学
    山西省人民政府扫除文盲委员会
    山西省工会联合会
    山西阳泉铁厂从一九四九年开始举办职工业余学校，最初参加学习的不到二百人，到一九五一年初，发展到了一千五百六十人，占当时全厂工人总数百分之九十三。但是，它不是稳步发展起来的，和生产以及各项中心运动的结合也很差，所以总是办起来又垮下去。从一九五一年七月到一九五二年六月整整停了一年课。一九五二年六月份开学了，可是不到四个月又停了课。一九五二年八月，厂里举办速成识字实验班，由于生产上经常调班和开会过多，学习时间得不到保证，这个实验班不久又垮了台。
    一九五三年，国家开始了有计划的经济建设。由于生产的需要，工人们对学习文化的要求更强烈了。而业余学校的教学组织形式仍不能适应生产的特点，加以学校和行政方面联系不密切，一遇到中心运动或调班的时候，不是学校停课，就是车间出勤率降低，学习和生产都受影响。这样，工人们的学习要求还是不能满足。当时，在工人中间流行着这样一句话，反映了广大职工的心情：年年上“业校”，年年念一册，啥时也毕不了业。
    阳泉铁厂职工业余学校没有办好的原因在那里呢？主要是：一、领导方面不重视职工业余文化教育；二、没有根据“服从生产和群众自愿”的原则来办学。车间领导方面和业余学校都把生产和学习对立起来看，业余学校干部片面地强调学习，车间干部片面地强调生产，所以经常发生矛盾。例如有时工人们正在学习，车间硬要拉去开会；倒班时车间和学校也不联系，结果就常常把学习挤垮了。
    如何使职工业余文化教育纳入正常发展的轨道，以满足工人们的文化学习要求，适应生产发展的需要呢？阳泉铁厂领导方面越来越觉得这个问题必须解决了。
    去年四月修高炉时，修理车间的工作时间改成了三班倒。作息时间有了变动，许多工人又因此不能学习，以至在速成班掉了队。修理车间当时共有职工三百一十二人，其中文盲和半文盲约有一百二十五人，都迫切要求学文化，他们都不愿这次又因为作息时间的变动而使学习半途而废，于是向领导方面提出了“车间办学”的建议。车间领导方面这时也开始感到，如果不把工人的文化学习搞好，就限制了职工政治觉悟的不断提高，他们的生产积极性也就不能充分发挥，于是，在认真考虑了工人的合理化建议之后，决定在车间办学。首先把车间里大约识三四百字的三十四名工人组织了一个班，教第二册国语和算术（下面简称二册班）。这个班在五月间开学，班的教学业务受业余学校教导处领导，公杂费由业余学校经费中开支，学习时间则在服从生产的原则下作了灵活安排：逢星期一、三、五学文化，星期六上政治课。这样过了三个月，成绩很好，就又把四十个文盲组织了一个班，上第一册国语和算术（下面简称一册班）。
    修理车间的文化学习班就这样办起来了。由于它是在车间党委领导下，依靠群众，发挥群众的智慧办起来的，所以工人们很爱它。工人们利用一切条件，使学习适应生产和生活。例如上课没有专门教室，他们就利用早上闲着的工作房——铆工股和建筑股的工作房作为固定教室。上课时，只要挂上一块黑板，把木板子搭起来，就是现成的“课桌”了。班内的一切行政事务，全由学员自己管理。车间工会通过班长领导大家学习。为了便于在学习上互相帮助，根据大家的意见，按生产组划分了学习小组。此外，他们还订了点名、抽查、表扬、批评等制度。因为学员们都在一个车间，谁无故旷课，谁经常迟到，谁在学习上偷懒，大家都知道得很清楚，批评能够很好地开展。加上每周公布抽查成绩，因而学习纪律一直很好，学生的到课率很高，学员们一直保持着饱满的学习情绪。
    教员是工人们从职员中选聘的。因为职员比较熟悉工人生活、思想和生产情况，所以教学上便于联系实际。过去业余学校采取大编班的方式，一班的学员来自各个不同的车间，教师举一个例子，很难照顾全面，往往你懂他不懂。车间办学正解决了这个问题，因为举的例子，都是本车间大家所熟悉的东西，谁都懂得。车间办学还便于“结合生产需要”和做到“学用一致”。例如，二册班国语课的教员根据学员们的要求，适当地教学员们练习写作简短的应用文，如便函、工作报告、合理化建议等，很受工人们欢迎，教学效果也很好。学员史实文起先把写文章看得很神秘，教师把他在开学典礼会上讲的话写在黑板上，说这就是一篇很好的文章，这大大地提高了史实文和其他学员学习写作的信心。史实文开始练习写作时，只能写一两个简短的句子，到去年八月，已经能写三、五百字的文章了。又如，算术对于修理车间的工人们说来，是经常离不了的东西，就是领取原料也得计算。因此按照工人们的需要，算术课适当增加了应用题。工人会心算，不会列算式，教师就讲解了列算式的方法。待工人懂了道理以后，就能在工作中计算比较复杂的算题了。
    车间办学由于能结合实际，所以教学效果是好的。截至一九五三年底，进度是：二册班共上了六个月课，国语上了七十五小时，讲完了一本二册课本，算术上了三十七小时，由整数加法讲到了乘法；一册班上了三个月课，共五十四小时，国语讲完了十八课，算术讲到了整数减法。成绩是：二册班的学员已有百分之六十能写二、三百字的短文，并且有二十七个学员有了写周记的习惯；算术方面，一般都能运算四则应用题，有一部分学员并通过自学学会了算小数题，赶过了教师所讲的课程的进度。一册班学员一般都已识到二百左右生字，有一部分学员则已超过此数，并能写几个连贯起来的简短句子；在算术方面，都会算加减法，个别学员还会算乘法和除法。
    工人们初步掌握了文字工具以后，就用在生产上。例如，有二十一年工龄的建筑工人冯成渭，小时候念过三冬“赵钱孙李”，认识百儿八十个字。这次他参加二册班学习了半年多，就能够初步地将学到的知识运用到生产上来。去年厂里派他领着四十个工人去修建从炼铁车间原料股到高炉的送料大桥，规定要在五十天内，用二千零四十个工和六十个运搬工完成这个工程。他接受了任务后，就把工作计划记在笔记本上，并且每天记工作日志。他的笔记本子上还划着点名表，登记工人每天的出勤情况；并把工人们的工作表现记在本子上，据此经常进行表扬和批评；此外，他把搜集的群众意见以及合理化建议也都记在他的本子上。工程完了后，他又用一百八十多个字写了一份工作报告，报告修建大桥的工程在全体工人的努力下，只用了三十九天就提前完成了任务，并且节省了一百一十个工。冯成渭经常带着他的小本本，他说：“现在我离了它真不能工作。”又如锻工张福全，工作时离不了量直径求圆周，因为他不会计算，过去只用不精确的“土办法”：量了直径后，再用绳子盘一下圆周，量出圆周的长短。后来，有人告诉他一个近似的计算方法。他当时知道，这个方法也是不够准确的，圆周的准确计算应该是“直径乘三点一四一六”，可是他不会运算乘法，几年来就只好用这个近似的办法来计算。这次他参加二册班学习，学会了小数乘法以后，计算圆周的问题就顺利地解决了，他非常高兴。
    修理车间的经验很快传播开了。
    阳泉铁厂共有炼铁、修理、耐火、供销四个车间。除了修理车间以外，其他各个车间的文化学习，由于生产上调班频繁，生产时间变动很大，也受到严重的影响，存在着“三天打鱼两天晒网”的自生自灭现象。自从修理车间在车间办学实验成功以后，耐火车间接着在去年八月底也办起学来了。他们按程度把工人编成甲、乙、丙三个班。耐火车间的领导方面对这三个班非常重视，订季度计划时，都把学习列为重要内容之一。遇到倒班时，也能适当地安排学习时间，使之不受影响。据今年一月份统计，该车间参加学习的已达一百四十九人（连参加业余学校学习的在内），占该车间职工总数百分之八十。
    修理车间和耐火车间办学成功以后，供销车间也正在准备办学。供销车间分采购、成品、运搬、仓库四股，生产时间变动更大，所以在车间办学是最适合的。工人们已征得厂方同意，收拾了几间旧仓库房做教室，准备就序即可开学。
    阳泉铁厂修理车间和耐火车间的职工业余文化教育工作现在已经走上了稳步发展的道路。如上所述，我们可以看出车间办学有两个显著的特点：第一、它是合乎“服从生产和群众自愿”的原则的。在不侵占生产时间和不妨碍生产的前提下，“车间办学”能够灵活地改变学习时间和教学组织形式，使职工文化学习得到保证，不受生产影响；教学内容也能紧密结合生产，适当地联系生产和生活。第二、车间办学的办法是先由修理车间的工人们根据自己的生产情况和学习要求提出来，实验成功后又逐步推广到各车间的，因此，它的发展是建立在群众的自觉自愿的基础之上的，它的组织形式和教学方法又能够适合群众的生产和生活情况，能够满足工人们的学习要求，所以，可以说这是一种走群众路线的办学方法。
