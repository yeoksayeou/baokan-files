Guizhou Province Ethnic Trade Stores Actively Supply Iron Farm Tools

    State-owned ethnic trade stores in various parts of Guizhou Province are actively supplying iron farm tools to support spring plowing and production for minority farmers.

    The specifications and styles of farm tools needed by farmers of various ethnic minorities in Guizhou are very complex. State-owned ethnic trade stores in many areas have conducted prior investigations into the different requirements of farmers of each ethnicity for farm tools. According to a survey in Sanglang Township, Wangmo County, Miao farmers prefer to use plowshares shaped like roof tiles, while Buyi farmers in the same township prefer plowshares shaped like bamboo shoot leaves. There are more than ten specifications and styles of plowshares used by farmers of all ethnic groups in the county. Ethnic trade stores in Wangmo, Ceheng, Anlong, Puan, and other places sent cadres to Zhenfeng, Anshun, Guiyang, and other places as early as December last year to purchase and organize the processing of farm tools according to the different requirements of local ethnic farmers. As of April 23, the ethnic trade stores in the aforementioned areas had purchased more than 100,000 jin of steel in Guiyang. In addition to organizing handicraft processing in the aforementioned areas, processing contracts were also signed with more than 100 blacksmith households in Guiyang City. More than 17,000 pieces of iron farm tools such as harrows, flat hoes, weeding knives, and harrow teeth have now been processed. Currently, various trade stores are transporting and supplying the tools. The Huangping County State-owned Ethnic Trade Store sent two cadres to specifically oversee the processing of farm tools. By the end of March, it had organized the processing of more than 6,800 pieces of various types of hoes, sickles, weeding knives, and other farm tools. Some of the farm tools have been transferred to Siping, Jiuzhou, and other districts in the county for supply. After the Ziyun County Ethnic Trade Store supplied farm tools in areas without supply and marketing cooperatives, the market price of farm tools dropped by 20% compared to the past, which was praised by the minority people.

    贵州省民族贸易商店积极供应铁质农具
    贵州省各地国营民族贸易商店积极供应铁质农具，支持少数民族农民春耕生产。
    贵州各地各个少数民族农民需要的农具，规格、式样非常复杂。许多地区的国营民族贸易商店事先调查了各族农民对农具的不同要求。据望谟县桑郎乡的调查，苗族农民喜欢用瓦片形铧口，同一个乡的布依族农民却爱用笋壳叶形的铧口；全县各族农民使用的铧口，规格、式样共有十多种。望谟、册亨、安龙、普安等地的民族贸易商店，在去年十二月就先后派干部到贞丰、安顺和贵阳等地，根据当地各族农民的不同要求，进行采购和组织加工农具的工作。到四月二十三日止，上述各地的民族贸易商店已在贵阳购进钢铁十多万斤，除在上述地区组织手工业加工外，并在贵阳市和一百多家铁匠户订立了加工合同，现已加工出钉耙、板锄、薅刀、耙齿等铁质农具一万七千多件。目前，各贸易商店正一面调运，一面供应。黄平县国营民族贸易商店派了两个干部专门掌握农具加工工作，在三月底，已组织加工出各式锄头、镰刀、薅刀等农具六千八百多件；部分农具已调到该县四屏、旧州等区进行供应。紫云县民族贸易商店在没有供销合作社的地区供应了农具以后，市场农具价格比过去降低了百分之二十，受到少数民族人民的赞扬。
