Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on May 2nd.

The meeting adopted a letter to all Korean people regarding the proposal for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question put forward by Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs and chief representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea delegation, at the Geneva Conference. The meeting also passed a letter from the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front to the Geneva Conference.

The letter to the people first pointed out that the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front believes that the concrete plan for the peaceful reunification of our fatherland put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il at the Geneva Conference represents the true wishes of all Korean people and is the most reasonable, concrete, and feasible plan for the peaceful reunification of our fatherland. The Fatherland Front fully welcomes and supports it. The governments and representatives of the five major powers and relevant countries participating in the Geneva Conference should use this plan as the basis for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

The letter to the people emphasized: "The Korean nation is a whole, and Korea belongs to all the Korean people. The Korean question must be resolved according to the free will of the Korean people, and no external forces are allowed to interfere."

The letter to the people pointed out: For the peaceful reunification of Korea, all foreign troops must simultaneously withdraw from Korea. A national democratic unified government can only be established through truly free elections throughout Korea without any external interference. It is the most reasonable and feasible plan to form an all-Korea committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea to prepare for and implement such all-Korea elections. Taking measures by an all-Korea committee to promote economic and cultural ties between North and South Korea is one of the important steps to achieve the reunification of the Korean state.

The letter to the people called on members of all patriotic political parties and social organizations, all patriots, and social activists in Korea to actively demand that the Geneva Conference accept the proposal put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and use it as the basis for negotiating a solution to the Korean question; at the same time, they should promptly expose, rebuke, and smash the provocative conspiracies of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, and strive to stabilize the Korean armistice, achieve a lasting peace, ensure the simultaneous withdrawal of US troops and all foreign troops from Korea, and allow the Korean people to solve the Korean question themselves.

    朝鲜祖国战线发表告朝鲜人民书
    支持南日提出的和平解决朝鲜问题方案
    【新华社平壤四日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在五月二日举行会议。
    会议就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团首席代表南日外务相在日内瓦会议上提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的方案，通过了告全朝鲜人民书。会议并通过了祖国战线中央委员会写给日内瓦会议的信。
    告人民书首先指出，祖国战线中央委员会认为：南日外务相在日内瓦会议上提出的和平统一我们祖国的具体方案，代表了全朝鲜人民的真正愿望，是和平统一我们祖国的最合理的、具体的、切实可行的方案。祖国战线完全欢迎并支持它。参加日内瓦会议的五大国和有关国家的政府及代表应该以这个方案作为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础。
    告人民书着重指出：“朝鲜民族是一个整体，朝鲜是属于全朝鲜人民的。朝鲜问题必须根据朝鲜人民的自由意志来解决，不容许有任何外来的势力干涉。”
    告人民书指出：为了朝鲜的和平统一，一切外国军队必须同时撤出朝鲜。全国性的民主的统一的政府，只有在没有任何外力的干涉下实行全朝鲜的真正自由的选举才能够建立。由南北朝鲜代表组成全朝鲜委员会来筹备实施这样的全朝鲜选举，是最合理而切实可行的方案。由一个全朝鲜委员会采取措施促进南北朝鲜经济及文化联系，是实现朝鲜国家统一的重要的步骤之一。
    告人民书号召全朝鲜爱国政党和社会团体的成员、全体爱国人士和社会活动家们积极要求日内瓦会议接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出的方案，把它作为协商解决朝鲜问题的基础；同时要及时揭露、斥责和粉碎美帝国主义者及李承晚集团的挑衅阴谋，为稳定朝鲜停战、达成巩固的和平、使美国军队和所有外国军队同时撤出朝鲜、由朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题而斗争。
