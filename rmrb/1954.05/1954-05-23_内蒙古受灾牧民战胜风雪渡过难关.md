Inner Mongolian herdsmen in the Xilin Gol League and Hulunbuir League牧区, which suffered several blizzards, have quickly overcome the snowstorm disaster and safely survived the difficulties due to the strong leadership of the Party and government in leading the herdsmen to fight against the disaster, especially after receiving timely support from the People's Air Force, allowing all livestock to safely overcome the difficulties.

The Xilin Gol League suffered two blizzards in mid- and late March, while the Hulunbuir grassland also suffered from heavy snowstorms that lasted day and night in mid-March and mid-April. The snow accumulation in the Eastern United Banner, where snowfall was heavy, was generally over six inches, and in some places, the snow was as deep as three feet. Many pastures were covered by heavy snow, and herdsmen and hundreds of thousands of livestock were threatened by hunger and cold. This was also the time when ewes were lambing and cows were about to calve, so weak livestock were constantly dying, and ewes frequently miscarried. Many ewes had no milk after lambing, and the young livestock were on the verge of death. In the severely affected areas, grain and fodder were extremely scarce, and grain transport vehicles could not arrive quickly due to snow-covered roads or thawing, coupled with the long distance, making the situation serious.

After the disaster occurred in the Xilin Gol League, the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in addition to instructing the Party and government leaders of the League to make disaster relief and livestock protection the overriding central task, also allocated 300,000 jin of feed and 110,000 jin of roasted rice, oats, and white flour from the Zhaowuda League, as well as a large amount of sesame cakes, sesame oil, petroleum, and other materials, and allocated 300 million yuan in relief funds to solve the urgent needs of the disaster area. Two batches of vehicles were transferred from Zhangjiakou and other places to help the disaster area solve transportation difficulties. In addition, a delegation composed of Shi Rulin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Government, and Su He, Director of the Third Division of the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Work Department of the Sub-bureau, rushed to the disaster area day and night to express condolences and guide the work of disaster relief and livestock protection. The Xilin Gol League Committee of the Communist Party of China and the League People's Government established a disaster relief headquarters in the Eastern United Banner, where the snow disaster was severe, and organized more than 100 cadres from the League and Banner to go deep into the pastoral areas. According to the emergency instructions of the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, they put forward the battle cry of "feed one head is one head, reduce the death of one head is increase one head, and one lamb is also a part of the construction of the motherland," and mobilized the herdsmen to launch a struggle against the snow disaster. The Party and government leaders of the Hulunbuir League also attached great importance to the disaster in the Hulunbuir pastoral area. In addition to dispatching more than 380 cadres to go deep into the herdsmen's households to help the herdsmen come up with ideas, they also organized material supply stations in Manzhouli and Hailar to supply the disaster area with a large amount of feed as quickly as possible.

The Central People's Government, upon hearing about the disaster in the Xilin Gol League, was extremely concerned about it and immediately ordered the People's Air Force to support the people of the Xilin Gol League. From April 1st to 3rd, 15 aircraft braved the extremely bad weather to fly to Xilin Gol League and dropped more than 14,000 kilograms of grain and fodder over the Eastern United Banner. The Central People's Government also sent a delegation composed of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture to Xilin Gol League to express condolences. Although the vehicles were often trapped in mud on the way to the disaster area, and sometimes spent the night on the grassland, they still went deep into the Eastern United Banner on April 14th. During the condolence period, which lasted for more than half a month and covered a distance of more than 3,000 li, the delegation successively held mass rallies and small-scale symposiums in Qizuo (district) Lama Kulun, Liuzuo Xinmiao, Sanzuo Halaga Temple, and Erzuo Wanggai Temple to convey the concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao to the people in the disaster area.

After the above-mentioned series of measures, the pessimistic and disappointed mood of the masses was immediately reversed. In particular, the timely aerial delivery of feed by the People's Air Force strongly supported the herdsmen's struggle against disaster and livestock protection and enhanced the herdsmen's confidence in disaster resistance. When the planes of the People's Air Force transported grain to the Eastern United Banner batch after batch, many herdsmen were moved to tears. Herdsman Taola said: "In the old society, we suffered all kinds of bullying and oppression. Only after the Communist Party came were we liberated. Today, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao sent planes to deliver feed. It's as if I saw Chairman Mao come in person." Tegus said: "In the past, the reactionary rulers only knew how to ask us for cattle and sheep and never gave us a grain of food. Today, Chairman Mao sent planes from Beijing to deliver food to us. This is unprecedented. This grain did not come easily, and we must use it for disaster relief and livestock protection and be sure to feed the livestock well." When the Central Condolence Delegation arrived at the grassland from distant Beijing, it further boosted the herdsmen's determination to overcome the natural disaster. The herdsmen who participated in the condolence meeting, in addition to taking the initiative to propose to convey the spirit of condolence to every herdsman who could not attend the meeting due to busy production, also repeatedly assured the condolence delegation with excitement and firmness that under the leadership of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, they would do a good job in disaster relief and livestock protection, lambing and nurturing, etc., with practical actions, and increase livestock and animal products to support the construction of industry and agriculture in the motherland, in order to respond to the concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. Herdsmen formed mutual aid groups for disaster relief to feed livestock, remove snow, and implement separate feeding of healthy and weak sheep. The feed dropped by the planes in a timely manner played a huge role in rescuing livestock. After feeding, more than 40,000 heads of livestock that were about to starve to death climbed up from the ground, the ewes had milk, and a large number of young livestock were also saved. By early April, the phenomenon of livestock deaths had stopped. After the government took effective measures, the disaster situation in the Hulunbuir League also improved immediately, and by the end of April, the phenomenon of livestock deaths had been basically overcome.

After the disaster in the Xilin Gol League and the Hulunbuir League was quickly alleviated and stopped, the herdsmen thanked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with great excitement. They unanimously believed that the reason why they were able to quickly overcome this snowstorm disaster was first of all due to the timely dispatch of planes by the Central People's Government for rescue. They believed that this was a concrete embodiment of the great national policy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the enthusiastic concern for ethnic minorities and pastoral people. On April 4th, the First People's Congress of the Eastern United Banner sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on behalf of the people of the entire banner, expressing their heartfelt gratitude and guaranteeing to do their best in disaster relief work. All the representatives also wrote a letter of determination to Chairman Mao. When the condolence delegation was about to return to Beijing, the Party, government, army, and people of the Xilin Gol League handed a banner with the words "Thank you for your concern, and strive to realize socialist industrialization" to the condolence delegation, asking them to present it to their beloved Chairman Mao. The herdsmen wrote letters to thank Chairman Mao and the People's Air Force. Sai Qinghaibu, a woman from the Xilin Gol League, said: "The concern of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is more親切周到 than our own parents. Our own parents cannot be with us for a lifetime, but the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are always coming up with solutions for us." The herdsmen in the disaster area of the Hulunbuir League also said with emotion: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are too good! When we are in disaster, there are airplanes in the sky to comfort us (referring to the distribution of condolence letters by airplanes), there are cars on the ground to supply materials, and a large number of cadres are sent to help us, taking care of us from the sky to the ground. It is really meticulous."

    内蒙古受灾牧民战胜风雪渡过难关
    遭到数次暴风雪袭击成灾的内蒙古锡林郭勒盟和呼伦贝尔盟牧区，由于党政大力领导牧民向灾害作斗争，特别是得到人民空军的及时支援后，很快地战胜了风雪灾害，使全部牲畜安然渡过难关。
    锡林郭勒盟在三月中旬和下旬，接连遭到二次暴风雪袭击，呼伦贝尔草原也于三月中旬和四月中旬遭到大风雪连日继夜的袭击。降雪较大的东部联合旗积雪普遍在六寸以上，个别地方积雪深达三尺左右，不少草场被大雪压盖，牧民和数十万头牲畜遭受到饥寒交迫的威胁。这时又当母羊下羔、母牛也将下犊时期，因此瘦弱牲畜不断死亡，母畜频频流产，不少母羊下羔后没有奶，幼畜奄奄待毙。重灾区粮食、草料奇缺，而运粮车辆因道路雪封或翻浆，加以距离太远，不能很快运到，情况严重。
    锡林郭勒盟发生灾情后，中共中央内蒙古分局和内蒙古自治区人民政府除指示该盟党、政领导方面，把抗灾保畜作为压倒一切的中心工作外，并由昭乌达盟调拨了三十万斤饲料，十一万斤炒米、莜面、白面，和不少麻饼、麻油、石油等物资，并拨发了三亿元救济款，解决灾区急需，由张家口等地抽调了两批汽车帮助灾区解决运输困难。此外由政府农牧部副部长石汝麟、分局农牧工作部第三处处长苏和等同志组成慰问团，星夜赶到灾区，进行慰问和指导抗灾保畜工作。中共锡林郭勒盟盟委和盟人民政府在雪灾较重的东部联合旗成立了抗灾指挥部，组织盟、旗干部一百余名深入牧区，根据中共中央内蒙古分局的紧急指示，并提出“喂一头是一头，少死一头增一头，一只羊羔也是建设祖国的一份力量”的战斗口号，发动牧民向雪灾展开斗争。呼伦贝尔盟党政领导上对呼伦贝尔牧区的灾情也很重视，除抽派三百八十余名干部深入牧户帮助牧民出主意外，并在满洲里、海拉尔组织物资供应站，以大批饲料尽速地供应灾区。
    中央人民政府闻悉锡林郭勒盟受灾后，对此极为关怀，当即命令人民空军支援锡林郭勒盟人民。四月一日到三日飞机十五架次冒着非常恶劣的气候飞到锡盟，在东部联合旗上空投下了粮食、饲料一万四千多公斤。中央人民政府并派由内务部和农业部组成的慰问团到锡盟慰问。慰问团在驰往灾区道上，虽然车辆经常被陷到泥淖里，有时露宿草原，但还是在四月十四日即深入东部联合旗。在历时半个多月，行程三千多华里的慰问期间，慰问团先后到七佐（区）喇嘛库伦、六佐新庙、三佐哈拉嘎庙、二佐王盖庙等地召开群众大会和小型座谈会，向灾区人民传达了中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀。
    经过上述一系列的措施后，立刻扭转了群众悲观失望的情绪，特别是人民空军的及时空投饲料，有力地支援了牧民的抗灾保畜斗争和增强了牧民的抗灾信心。当人民空军的飞机一批一批地把粮食运往东部联合旗时，不少牧民被感动得掉下眼泪。牧民陶拉说：“在旧社会我们受尽了欺负和压迫，共产党来了才得到解放，今天共产党、毛主席又派飞机送来了饲料，我就好像看到毛主席也亲自来了。”特古斯说：“过去反动统治者，只知道向我们要牛羊，从来没见给过我们一粒粮食，今天毛主席从北京派飞机来给我们送粮食，真是空前没有的事。这些粮食不是容易来的，我们要把它用在抗灾保畜上，一定要把牲畜喂好。”当中央慰问团从遥远的北京到达草地后，更振奋了牧民一定要战胜天灾的决心。参加慰问大会的牧民们，除主动提出要把慰问的精神传达给由于生产忙碌没能参加大会的每一个牧民外，并都激动而坚定地再三向慰问团保证：要在内蒙古自治区人民政府的领导下，以实际行动做好抗灾保畜接羔保育等工作，多多增加牲畜和畜产品，支援祖国工农业建设，来回答中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀。牧民纷纷组成抗灾互助组给牲畜喂料，铲除积雪，实行健弱羊分群饲养。飞机及时投下的饲料，对抢救牲畜起了极大的作用。喂料后，四万多头快饿死的牲畜从地上爬了起来，母畜有了奶，大批的幼畜也得了救，到四月上旬，牲畜死亡的现象已停止。呼伦贝尔盟的灾情经政府采取有效措施后，也立刻好转，到四月末牲畜死亡的现象已基本克服。
    锡林郭勒盟和呼伦贝尔盟的灾情迅速减轻和停止后，牧民们都以十分激动的心情感谢共产党和毛主席。他们一致认为所以能够很快地战胜这次风雪灾害，首先应归功于中央人民政府及时派飞机抢救，他们认为这是党中央、毛主席伟大的民族政策与对少数民族、牧区人民热烈关怀的具体体现。东部联合旗首届人民代表大会于四月四日代表全旗人民致电毛主席，表达了衷心感激的心情，并保证用全力做好抗灾工作。全体代表还向毛主席写了决心书。当慰问团将要返回北京的时候，锡盟党、政、军、民把一面有“感谢您的关怀，为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗”字样的锦旗交与慰问团，叫代为敬献给亲爱的毛主席。牧民纷纷写信感谢毛主席与人民空军。锡盟妇女赛青亥布说：“共产党、毛主席的关怀比亲生父母还要亲切周到，亲生父母不能跟我们一辈子，而共产党、毛主席是随时给我们出办法的。”呼伦贝尔盟灾区牧民也感动地说：“共产党、毛主席太好了！我们受灾，天上有飞机安慰（指用飞机散发慰问信），地上有汽车供给物资，还派来大批干部帮助，从天上到地上照顾我们，真是无微不至。”
