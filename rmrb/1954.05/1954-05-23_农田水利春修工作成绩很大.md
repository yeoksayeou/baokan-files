    Agricultural water conservancy spring repairs have achieved great results. In most provinces in the South, spring repair projects are nearing completion. According to incomplete statistics from East China, more than 350,000 ponds, dams, ditches, and other projects have been built and renovated, with over 100.8 million cubic meters of earthwork completed, expanding and improving the benefited area by more than 14.4 million mu. In the Central and Southern regions, Hunan Province alone has built and renovated more than 360,000 ponds, dams, wells, and canals, more than 440 small reservoirs, and more than 150 culverts. Guangdong Province has repaired more than 70,000 small-scale water conservancy projects, benefiting an area of more than 2.8 million mu. In the Southwest region, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces are vigorously building water conservancy projects in conjunction with spring plowing. Among them, Yunnan Province has repaired more than 280,000 projects, benefiting an area of more than 3 million mu. In the northern provinces, agricultural water conservancy work is underway. As of early May, Hebei Province has dug more than 2,000 wells, more than 1,500 cone wells, repaired more than 3,000 old wells, and purchased more than 28,000 water carts. Liaodong Province has developed 60,000 mu of paddy fields, exceeding the original plan by 43 percent, of which 37,000 mu have been converted from dry land to paddy fields, and more than 22,000 mu of new wasteland have been reclaimed. Due to this change, the province will increase its production of fine grains by 36 million jin for the state this year. In order to help banners and counties build water conservancy projects, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has dispatched more than 80 cadres and well-digging, cone-drilling, and water well installation technicians. In the Northwest region, the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments successively dispatched more than 250 cadres to various provinces to inspect spring water conservancy work in March and April. Ningxia Province completed its spring repair project ahead of schedule at the end of April, which not only guaranteed the irrigation of existing water areas, but also expanded the irrigated area by more than 40,000 mu.

    This year, most provinces and regions have gained experience through key points in leading water conservancy construction and provided specific guidance for overall work. For example, before the start of the work, Anhui Province sent working groups to three townships and one district with different representatives to conduct investigation work, which greatly helped in formulating the province's water conservancy construction plan. The North China Water Conservancy Bureau also established key work areas in Changping and other counties in Hebei Province in the spring, dispatched working groups to specifically grasp and absorb the experience of organizing farmers to dig wells and canals to guide the work in the entire region. All localities have also clarified that water conservancy work must be closely linked to the task of socialist transformation of agriculture, and have made certain achievements. For example, the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan, took the lead in repairing a five-li-long river dam, guaranteeing the water supply for more than 400 mu of land, and dispatched 11 waterwheels to rescue more than 4 mu of drought-stricken land. Then, through the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, it introduced experience to drive the whole village to store water for drought prevention, ensuring full planting. Through collective water conservancy construction, Sanjue District in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, restored more than 340 mutual aid groups, and another 200 households of farmers joined the mutual aid groups. All localities have also planned to train grassroots cadres, summarize and promote mass experience, and improve the technical level of the masses and the quality of construction projects. Fujian Province alone has trained more than 800 farmer water conservancy technicians. Among the 409 water conservancy projects built in Putian County, the province, 343 were designed and constructed by local farmer technicians, and the project quality was very good.

    农田水利春修工作成绩很大
    【本报讯】各地农田水利春修工作已获得很大成绩。南方多数省份春修工程已近结束，华东区据不完全统计，共兴修和整修了塘、坝、沟渠等工程三十五万多处，完成土方一亿零八百多万公方，扩大和改善受益面积一千四百多万亩。中南区仅湖南省即兴修、整修塘、坝、井、圳等工程三十六万多处，小型水库四百四十多座，涵闸一百五十多座。广东省修好的小型水利工程七万多处，受益面积二百八十多万亩。西南区四川、云南、贵州、西康各省正在结合春耕生产，大力兴修水利。其中云南省已修工程二十八万多处，受益面积在三百万亩以上。北方各省兴修农田水利工作正在展开，河北省截至五月上旬统计，已打井两千多眼，锥井一千五百多眼，修旧井三千多眼，贷购水车二万八千多辆。辽东省已开发水田六万市亩，超过原计划百分之四十三，其中有三万七千多市亩是由旱地改成水田，新开荒地有两万二千多亩，由于这一改变，今年将为国家增产细粮三千六百万斤。内蒙古自治区为了帮助旗、县兴修水利，已派出干部和打井、锥井、安装水井技工八十多人。西北区农林水利部门，在三、四月间先后派出二百五十多名干部到各省检查水利春修工作。宁夏省春修工程已在四月底提前完工，除保证原有水地灌溉外，并可扩大灌溉面积四万多亩。
    今年多数省、区在领导兴修水利工作中，都通过基点取得经验，具体指导全面工作。例如安徽省在工作开始以前，曾派出工作组到具有不同代表性的三个乡和一个区进行调查工作，对制订全省兴修水利的计划帮助很大。华北区水利局也于春季在河北省昌平等县建立工作重点，派遣工作组具体掌握，吸取组织农民打井、开渠的经验，以指导全区工作。各地在兴修水利工程中，还明确了水利工作必须与农业社会主义改造的任务密切联系，并做出了一定的成绩。如四川内江县红旗农业生产合作社，带头修了一道五里长的河堰，保证了四百多亩田的用水，又出动十一架水车抢救了四亩多旱田，然后通过互助合作代表会介绍经验，带动全村蓄水防旱，保证了满栽满插。安徽省寿县三觉区通过集体兴修水利，恢复了三百四十多个互助组，另有二百多户农民参加了互助组。各地还有计划地训练了基层干部，并总结推广群众经验，提高群众技术水平和兴修工程的质量。仅福建省就培养了农民水利技术人员八百多人，该省莆田县兴修的四百零九处水利工程中，有三百四十三处是由当地农民技术人员掌握设计和施工，工程质量都很好。
