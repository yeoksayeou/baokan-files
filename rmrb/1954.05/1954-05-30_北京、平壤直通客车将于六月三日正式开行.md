     【本报讯】北京、平壤直通客车（每周对开两次），将在六月三日正式开行。北京铁路管理局车辆段和列车段的职工正热烈地进行准备工作。
    中朝铁路联运的客车，由北京铁路管理局车辆段整备、加修，职工们提出：为了加强中朝两国人民的友谊，保证质量良好并提前完成任务。这些客车经过整修，美观而又舒适。车厢里的铜、铁零件和脚登板、暖气罩等都经过电镀；通风设备完善；在窗户上安有铜丝纱窗，有用白丝罗和绿丝绒做的两层窗帘；每个房间里都有电扇。为了适当地调整光线，各房间里都安着明光灯和暗光灯；各种标记牌上都写着中朝两种文字。五月二十七日已把第一组客车送往平壤。其余几组客车预计在五月底即可完成。
    直通客车乘务工作，由北京铁路管理局列车段和车辆段的职工担任，为了工作方便，铁道部还从图们地区调来九名朝鲜族列车员。这些乘务员都在北京铁路管理局举办的联运训练班里，学习了联运规章和有关业务。他们都满心高兴地准备着到期出乘。
