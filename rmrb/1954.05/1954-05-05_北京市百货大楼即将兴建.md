    北京市百货大楼即将兴建
    为了适应首都人民购买力提高的需要，首都规模最大的一座百货大楼——北京市百货大楼，将要在繁荣的王府井大街的中段路西修建了。大楼将在五月份动工，预计在一九五五年第一季度竣工。
    大楼占用的土地面积有四千多平方公尺，楼房的总面积有一万八千四百多平方公尺，营业场所有一万二千多平方公尺。营业面积相当于天津市百货公司的三倍多；总面积和有名的莫斯科中央百货公司的营业面积一样大。大楼是结合民族形式来设计的。
    在大楼的前面，还留着一片一千三百二十平方公尺的绿化园地。这里将要铺上绿色的草坪，种上美丽的鲜花，还要设置终日喷射水花的喷水泉。当顾客们在逛了公司选购了满意的货品而感到疲惫的时候，草坪上将是憩息的良好场所。
    大楼的前部共六层，后部共五层，并有地下室。它的高度略低于首都的北京饭店。在六层楼的顶上，竖立起五根笔直的旗杆。每逢节日，将会有五面红旗在天空中迎风招展。
    大楼的南、北和前面共有六个出入口，靠王府井大街有两处足够十多人并行的正门。南北面各有二处出入口。第一层楼的壁是用大理石和假石砌成的，地面铺着水磨石，有十三座总面积达一百五十平方公尺的大陈列窗，用作陈列各种食品、用具和衣料之用。这里将准备设立服务部，服务部主要是替顾客配备货品，还有问讯处和银行办事处，专门为顾客们服务。此外，还设立食品、搪瓷和瓷制用品、日用化妆、五金电料、文具、毛巾、袜子等部。从大楼第二、三层楼向上，四壁都是用面砖砌成，地面铺上各色坚固的马赛克，有宽敞的玻璃窗，室内阳光充足。第二层楼准备设立儿童用品、布匹、服装、床上用品、鞋帽等部。第三层楼准备设立呢绒、绸缎、皮货皮件、文娱和体育用品、钟表眼镜、科学仪器、特种工艺品、家具等部。四层楼以上是工作人员的办公室。这座大楼在同一时间内可以容纳一万多顾客，将有一千多名售货员，每天约可供给十二万以上顾客所需要的东西。大楼各层都有通风设备，可以不断地抽走污浊的空气，把新鲜的空气更换进来。
    如果人们从大楼的第一层楼到第三层楼各部浏览一周，就等于走七华里路，要一个多钟头。各楼设有休息室，专供顾客们休息。在二层楼特设母子室，给带孩子的女顾客休息。
    现在室内装备还没有最后设计好。据初步设计，全楼要设置长七华里半玻璃货柜，要用三百瓩的电力，单橱窗和货柜中的日光灯就有二千五百多根，还有宫灯及各式照明灯，使人们一进里面就如同走进富丽堂皇的展览馆一样。
