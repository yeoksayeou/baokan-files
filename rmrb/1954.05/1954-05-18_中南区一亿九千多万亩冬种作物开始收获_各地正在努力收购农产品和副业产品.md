Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th. The winter crops, including wheat and miscellaneous grains, planted on over 190 million mu in the Central South region are being harvested successively from south to north. In Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, over 3 million mu of wheat have been harvested, with an estimated increase of 10-20% compared to last year. The remaining 101 million mu of wheat in other provinces are generally growing better than last year. Wheat in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces is ripening soon, and farmers are sharpening their sickles and preparing threshing grounds for harvest. Wheat harvesting has begun in southern Jiangxi province. In Henan province, most of the wheat has headed and some is budding, promising a good harvest. Green manure crops in various regions have been turned over; barley, beans, and potatoes have either already achieved a bumper harvest or are expected to do so. Sweet potatoes, accounting for more than half of the winter crop area in Guangdong province, are generally yielding 10-20% more than last year. In Hunan province, broad beans generally have tall stalks and full pods, with an estimated yield of 150 jin per mu.

Since last winter and this spring, farmers in the Central South region have generally carried out timely and meticulous cultivation, weeding, irrigation, and fertilization of winter crops. Although Henan province experienced several late frosts, the impact on winter crops was minimal due to good field management and vigorous prevention and rescue efforts before and after the frosts. Some areas of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces experienced flooding, but winter crops recovered normal growth after timely drainage. Currently, in areas about to harvest wheat and beans, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have drawn up harvesting plans to ensure careful harvesting and threshing, striving to return every grain to the household.

This newspaper, Wuhan, 17th. State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various parts of the Central South region are actively engaged in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products. The purchase of edible oil throughout the region began in the fourth quarter of last year and, by mid-April this year, had fulfilled 56.05% of the state plan, with Hunan province nearing completion of the plan. Rapeseed purchase has begun in Guangdong and other regions; many areas are carrying out purchases through advance purchases. The number of live pigs purchased in the region in the first four months of this year was 81% of the total for last year, exceeding the purchase target for this period; now, various regions are continuing to order and purchase live pigs. Other agricultural and sideline products such as cotton, ramie, raw silk, tea, fresh eggs, fruits, and aquatic products have been purchased or pre-ordered in various regions, and many areas have completed the pre-purchase of some products.

This year, the planned purchase volume of agricultural and sideline products in the Central South region generally exceeds last year's by 50% to 100%; the prices of some products have also been appropriately increased compared to last year. In particular, the state's launch of advance purchase of agricultural products this year has greatly benefited farmers. According to incomplete statistics, the deposits paid to farmers by the region for pre-purchasing rapeseed, ramie, spring tea, silkworm cocoons, and other products in the past three months can purchase approximately 200 million jin of cake fertilizer. Farmers in tea-producing areas have purchased many tea-making tools after receiving pre-purchase deposits from the state.

The state's vigorous purchase of agricultural and sideline products has been supported by the vast number of farmers. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions are enthusiastically selling agricultural and sideline products to the state or actively signing pre-purchase contracts with the state. In mid-April, in the key cotton-producing areas of Henan province – Tangyin County, Qi County, and Ye County – ninety-nine agricultural production cooperatives and five hundred and thirty-two year-round mutual aid teams signed six hundred and thirty-one contracts with the state in ten days, pre-selling 2.3 million jin of seed cotton, 30,000 jin of ginned cotton, and 130,000 jin of wheat, with farmers receiving over 300 million yuan in deposits. After pre-selling products, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions revised their production plans according to the state's needs and proposed to do a good job in replanting seedlings, thinning seedlings, and preventing pests to strive for a bumper harvest of agricultural products.

    中南区一亿九千多万亩冬种作物开始收获
    各地正在努力收购农产品和副业产品
    【新华社武汉十六日电】中南区一亿九千多万亩小麦、杂粮等冬种作物，正由南而北陆续收获。广东、广西两省三百多万亩小麦已收割完毕，比去年约增产一二成。其余各省一亿零一百多万亩小麦，生长情况大都比去年好。湖南、江西、湖北三省麦子快要黄熟，农民正磨镰碾场，准备收割。江西省南部地区正开始割麦。河南省的小麦已大部出穗，有的已打苞，可望增产。各地的绿肥作物都已翻耕，大麦、豆类和薯类等有的已告丰收，有的丰收在望。广东省占冬种作物面积二分之一以上的番薯，普遍比去年增产一二成。湖南省的蚕豆一般棵高荚满，估计每亩可收一百五十斤。
    去冬今春以来，中南区各地农民对冬种作物进行中耕、除草、灌溉、追肥等，一般都比较适时和细致。河南省虽然连降晚霜，但由于平时田间管理较好，再加降霜前后大力预防和抢救，一般冬种作物所受影响不大。湖北、江西、湖南三省部分地区曾先后发生雨涝，经过及时开沟排水，冬种作物便恢复正常生长。目前，在即将收割小麦、豆类的地区，许多农业生产合作社和互助组都订出收割计划，保证作到细收细打，争取颗粒还家。
    【本报武汉十七日电】中南区各地国营商业部门和合作社积极进行收购农业和副业产品的工作。全区收购食油的工作从去年第四季度开始，到今年四月中旬止，已完成国家计划百分之五十六点零五；其中湖南省已接近完成计划。菜籽收购工作，已在广东等地展开；许多地区正在通过预购方式进行收购。全区今年四个月来收购毛猪的数量，为去年全年的百分之八十一，超额完成了这个时期的收购任务；现在，各地正继续订购和收购毛猪。其他如棉花、苎麻、生丝、茶叶、鲜蛋、水果等农、副业产品及水产品，各地都进行了收购或预购，许多地区并已结束了部分产品的预购工作。
    今年中南区计划收购农、副业产品的数量，一般都超过去年半倍至一倍；有些产品的价格，也比去年适当提高。特别是今年国家展开了预购农产品的工作，农民们都得到很大好处。据不完全统计，全区最近三个月来，国家预购菜籽、苎麻、春茶、蚕丝等产品付给农民的定金，约可购买饼肥两亿斤。产茶区的农民得到国家的预购定金以后，已购置了许多制茶工具。
    国家大力收购农、副业产品，受到广大农民的拥护。各地的农业生产合作社和互助组，都踊跃地把农、副业产品卖给国家，或积极和国家订立预购合同。河南省重点产棉区——汤阴县、淇县、邺县在四月中旬十天内，就有九十九个农业生产合作社及五百三十二个常年互助组和国家订了六百三十一件合同，预售籽棉二百三十万斤、皮棉三万斤及小麦十三万斤，农民们得到定金三亿多元。各地许多农业生产合作社和互助组预售产品以后，根据国家需要重新修订了生产计划，并提出要做好补苗、间苗，防治虫害等工作，争取农产品丰收。
