Soviet Newspaper Experience

    Newspapers Should Educate the Masses in the Communist Spirit
    Chen Yongwen
    The newspaper is the most powerful weapon for the Party to conduct socialist and communist education among the broad masses. To educate the masses in the communist spirit is the most fundamental task of the Party's newspaper.
    According to the principles of newspaper work repeatedly taught by Lenin, and the experience of "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers, if newspapers are to educate the masses in the communist spirit, they must regularly and systematically publicize the theories of Marxism-Leninism to the broad masses. Because only by arming the millions of masses with the scientific theory of the working class can they understand and grasp the laws of social development, and understand and master the laws of building socialism and communism; make them truly understand their glorious tasks, guide them to learn to manage economic, political and cultural work, and victoriously carry out the cause of socialist and communist construction.
    In order to undertake this major propaganda task, the editorial departments of "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers have special departments for the propaganda of Marxist-Leninist theory. The work of this department is very complicated. It must combine Marxist-Leninist theory with practice and convey many important theoretical viewpoints to millions of readers. Among the readers of "Pravda" are workers, peasants, and intellectuals, so in addition to regularly publishing theoretical articles on philosophy, history, aesthetics, and other aspects, it also uses easy-to-understand language to write about economics, improving labor productivity, economic accounting and costs, how collective farms can increase income, and the development of collective farms in various aspects, based on Marxist-Leninist theory. In addition to systematically publicizing the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism to the working masses, the theoretical propaganda department of "Labor News" also regularly publishes theoretical articles on the history of trade unions and trade union construction. Soviet newspapers also frequently use the form of "Answering Readers' Questions" to answer various questions raised by readers in their theoretical studies; they regard assisting the theoretical study of the masses as one of their main tasks.
    Regularly and systematically publicizing and explaining the Party's policies to the broad masses is also an important part of newspapers educating the people in the communist spirit. In its past resolutions on newspaper work, the CPSU Central Committee reminded and required newspapers to try their best to profoundly and popularly explain all policy issues related to politics, economy, and Party life. Soviet trade union newspapers also paid close attention to reporting on rural issues, publicizing and explaining to the working masses the main points of rural Soviets and Party construction, as well as the main points of the Party's peasant policy. Soviet newspapers constantly report on the strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance and the strengthening of friendship between the Soviet state and nationalities.
    Another important aspect of newspapers educating the masses in the communist spirit is to never forget to educate the broad masses in the spirit of internationalism. Soviet newspapers pay great attention to publicizing international issues and the world workers' movement, paying attention to systematically reporting the economic conditions of the proletariat in various countries and the work of communist parties in various countries, and paying special attention to publicizing the various struggles of the people of various people's democratic countries for peace and construction. A prominent feature of "Pravda" is that it does not speak only as a representative of a country or a nation, but also as a representative of a part of the world workers' movement. "Pravda" has never limited itself to the national circle, but speaks to the working class all over the world, and speaks as a participant in an international workers' movement.
    However, the communist education that newspapers conduct among the masses cannot be limited to the above aspects of propaganda. Newspapers must combine the goals of socialism and communism with people's labor, educate the masses to work faithfully and selflessly, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and experts to overfulfill the state's plans, and strive to better create the material basis of socialism. Newspapers must continue to promote this communist thought and communist labor attitude to the most backward elements. In the early days of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union, some workers and peasants once believed that only geniuses could build socialism. But when the working masses participated in socialist competitions, they could realize in their daily labor that the power to build socialism was not some "genius," but precisely the labor of their own hands. Newspapers that effectively promote socialist competitions can make workers and peasant laborers realize that socialist construction is their own business and turn socialist construction into their specific daily actions. Therefore, during the first five-year plan and the years that followed in the Soviet Union, the most important work of "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers was to report on the labor of the working class and working people in the primary position of the newspaper, promote labor competitions, and make the newspaper a powerful weapon for promoting labor competitions. This is an extremely important aspect of newspapers educating the masses in the communist spirit.
    How can newspapers conduct communist education among the masses through the promotion of labor competitions? According to the experience of "Pravda" and "Labor News," it should mainly be carried out from the following aspects.
    First, it is necessary to publicize the scale and results of the masses' heroic labor in building socialism. In 1932, the Soviet Union made great progress in the production of agricultural machinery and automobile manufacturing. On December 19, 1932, "Pravda" used a special page to promote: "The Soviet Union uses its own tractors to cultivate the land and its own cars to walk!" On December 23, 1932, "Pravda" published two special pages, the general title of which was: "The Completion of the Ural-Kuznetsk Metallurgical Complex is the Victory of the Party's General Line." This special page reported that dozens of new metallurgical enterprises, new coal mines, new non-ferrous metal mines, and new large industrial centers were built in the vast area from the Urals to western Siberia. The special page also included a map showing the distribution of enterprises, which vividly told readers how large an industrial zone the Soviet people had created with their own labor. The frequent publication of this kind of material in newspapers encouraged the labor enthusiasm of millions of working masses in building socialism.
    Second, it is necessary to educate the masses with vivid and clear examples of the masses creatively participating in socialist construction. When conducting communist education, newspapers should not only make the working masses understand the principles of communism, but also provide them with examples of communist labor attitudes. The task of the newspaper is to learn from the brilliant example suggested by Lenin's "The Great Beginning," and to select examples from ordinary life to educate the masses. "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers have been following Lenin's principles to report on labor competitions. At the same time, Soviet newspapers, whether in the past or now, have been striving to support and develop the sprouts of the masses' new attitudes towards labor and public wealth.
    Third, it is necessary to study, summarize, and promote the experience of advanced producers in the newspaper. Lenin once attached particular importance to promoting new ways of working in newspapers. He said: "We now need to pay attention to those extremely precious materials, that is, the experience of new production organizations in certain cities, certain enterprises, and certain rural communes, and make this experience the property of the masses." [Note 1] According to Lenin's instructions, "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers are almost every day promoting and popularizing the experience of advanced producers, and discovering more new production innovators. Because the experience of advanced workers and advanced peasants in remote areas can only be spread to all parts of the country by newspapers. In this regard, "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers try their best to let advanced producers speak in newspapers and take the form of special pages to promote their experience.
    Fourth, it is necessary to actively support the initiatives of the masses. In the competition, with the continuous improvement of the activeness and creativity of people's labor, a large number of initiatives will inevitably emerge. At this time, newspapers must treat and support the initiatives of the masses with a very careful, kind, and caring attitude. On April 22, 1930, the 60th anniversary of Lenin's birth, "Pravda" published an article entitled "The Best Memorial to the Leader." This article described the initiative put forward by the miners of Donbass, who will overfulfill the construction plan to build a new mine named after Lenin. With the support of "Pravda," this initiative received a warm response from coal miners and workers in mining machinery manufacturing plants across the country.
    The initiative of the Donbass miners supported by "Pravda" played a great role in reducing product costs, accumulating funds, carrying out socialist competitions, and inspiring the masses' heroic spirit in socialist construction. Of course, newspapers must treat the initiatives put forward by the masses with a responsible attitude. First of all, the facts of the initiative itself must be investigated clearly, and the evaluation of the relevant Party organizations, industrial authorities, and trade unions on it must be understood, and their opinions must be listened to. Newspapers should support all advanced and beneficial suggestions, and should not blindly indulge in all suggestions without analysis and criticism.
    Fifth, it is necessary to appropriately publicize the improvement of workers' working conditions and the measures for people's welfare. At the end of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union, the results of industrialization and agricultural collectivization freed the people from all exploitation and greatly improved the people's living standards. "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers vigorously publicized this fact. Newspapers pay attention to the publicity of this aspect, which can make the broad masses of workers realize from their own labor that the purpose of industrial production is nothing else but for people and their needs; they are not working for others, but for themselves. In this way, people's socialist consciousness can be improved and people can be encouraged to actively participate in labor competitions.
    Sixth, it is necessary to conduct unceremonious criticism of the specific shortcomings in production work. Regarding this point, Lenin said in the first draft of "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime": "In order to improve the self-government of the workers, in order to transform those worthless old work attitudes—or rather, those capitalist society’s procrastination and avoidance of work attitudes, the first and most important means we should use should be newspapers. Newspapers can expose the shortcomings of economic life in every labor commune, relentlessly criticize these shortcomings, and publicly expose all the problems in our economic life, so as to submit these shortcomings to the public opinion of all working people in order to seek a radical cure." [Note 2]
    "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers have done exactly as Lenin instructed. While promoting competitions, they constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism, educating people to develop new labor discipline and labor attitudes; and constantly wage unyielding and sharp struggles against all conservative, decadent, and stagnant phenomena. The Party relies on the social public opinion represented by newspapers to expose and eliminate all shortcomings and errors in production activities. In the Soviet Union, in order to protect the interests of the Party and the interests of the country and the people, the criticism conducted in newspapers is unceremonious and does not ask about the target. Newspapers often unceremoniously criticize the shortcomings of economic leaders and criticize the shortcomings of trade union organizations and the working masses. On April 2, 1924, "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "Open Fire on People Like Matveev." Matveev was a worker in a paper mill who drank and made trouble, and destroyed machines under the instigation of the enemy. In another article in the same issue of the newspaper, a worker named Stenkaiki was criticized for refusing to work after arguing with an engineer. After these editorials and articles were published, the workers demanded that these people be punished and legal sanctions be imposed on them. This was later done, which educated millions of other people. Without criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, the masses cannot be educated in the communist spirit and work cannot be promoted. However, criticism should be based on facts, should be fair and realistic; at the same time, criticism should not be damaging to people's self-esteem, insulting to people, but should be educational and alert to people. When criticizing shortcomings, the achievements of people's work should not be ignored, nor should one point out the shortcomings of others all day long without reflecting on how the shortcomings are corrected. Criticism should help the criticized to correct shortcomings and improve all our work.
    The experience of "Pravda" shows that the communist education conducted by the Party's newspapers among the broad masses is an education that runs through various specific issues, combines theory with practice, and must be regular, systematic, and multi-faceted. To well realize this task, first of all, it requires newspaper staff to have strong Party spirit, be loyal to the Party's newspaper cause, and constantly improve their ideological level, strive to study and master the theories of Marxism-Leninism, and strive to study and implement the Party's policies. For our trade union newspapers, it is even more necessary to constantly strengthen contact with the working masses, deeply study the various practical problems that occur in the struggles and lives of the working masses, and help the working masses use the communist spirit to understand and solve these problems.

    报纸要以共产主义精神教育群众
    陈用文
    报纸是党用来向广大群众进行社会主义、共产主义教育的最有力的武器。以共产主义精神教育群众，这是党的报纸的最根本的任务。
    根据列宁所一再教导的报刊工作的原则，以及
  “真理报”和苏联其他报纸的经验，报纸要以共产主义精神教育群众，就必须经常地、系统地向广大群众宣传马克思列宁主义的理论。因为只有以工人阶级的科学理论来武装千百万群众，才能使他们认识和掌握社会发展的规律，认识和掌握建设社会主义共产主义的规律；使他们真正了解自己光荣的任务，引导他们学会管理经济、政治和文化方面的工作，胜利地去进行社会主义和共产主义的建设事业。
    为了担负这一重大的宣传任务，“真理报”和苏联其他报纸的编辑部，都专设有马克思列宁主义理论宣传部。这个部门的工作是很复杂的，它要使马克思列宁主义的理论与实践相结合，把许多重大的理论观点传达到千百万读者中去。“真理报”的读者中有工人、农民、知识分子，所以它除了定期地发表关于哲学、历史学、美学和其他方面的理论文章之外，还要把经济、提高劳动生产率、经济核算和成本、集体农庄如何增加收入以及集体农庄各方面的发展等等问题，根据马克思列宁主义的理论，用浅显的话写出来。“劳动报”的理论宣传部除有计划地向工人群众宣传马克思列宁主义的基础知识外，还经常发表关于工会历史和工会建设的理论文章。苏联报纸并且经常用“答读者问”的形式，解答读者提出的理论学习中的各种问题；它们把辅导群众的理论学习，当做自己的主要任务之一。
    经常地有系统地向广大群众宣传解释党的政策，也是报纸以共产主义精神教育人民的重要内容之一。苏共中央在有关报纸工作的历次决议中，提醒和要求报纸应该竭力深刻地和通俗地阐明一切有关政治、经济和党的生活的政策问题。苏联的工会报纸也十分注意报道农村问题，向工人群众宣传解释农村苏维埃的和党的建设的要点以及党的农民政策的要点。苏联报纸经常不断地报道工农联盟的加强，和苏维埃国家与民族友谊的加强。
    报纸以共产主义精神教育群众的另一个重要内容，就是要时时刻刻不忘记以国际主义的精神教育广大人民。苏联报纸很注意宣传国际问题和世界工人运动，注意有系统地报道各国无产阶级的经济状况以及各国共产党的工作情况，并且特别注意宣传各人民民主国家的人民为和平与建设而作的各种斗争。“真理报”有一个突出的特点，就是它不只是作为一个国家或一个民族的代表在发言，同时还作为全世界工人运动一部分的代表在发言。“真理报”从来没有把自己限制在民族的圈子内，而是面对着全世界工人阶级说话，作为一个国际工人运动的参加者在说话。
    但是，报纸向群众进行共产主义的教育，不能只限于以上几方面的宣传。报纸必须把社会主义和共产主义的目的和人们的劳动结合起来，教育群众忠实地、忘我地劳动，动员工人和专家们的积极性和创造精神来超额完成国家的计划，为更好地创造社会主义的物质基础而斗争。报纸要把这种共产主义的思想和共产主义的劳动态度，一直宣传到最落后的分子中去。苏联在第一个五年计划的初期，有些工人和农民曾经认为只有天才才能建设社会主义。但当工农群众参加社会主义竞赛时，他们就可以在自己每天的劳动中，体会到建设社会主义的力量不是什么“天才”，而正是自己双手的劳动。报纸很好地宣传社会主义竞赛，就能使工人、农民劳动者认识到社会主义建设是他们自己的事情，把社会主义建设变成他们的具体的日常行动。因此，在苏联第一个五年计划及其以后的年代里，“真理报”和苏联其他报纸最主要的工作，就是要在报纸的首要地位，报道工人阶级和劳动人民的劳动，宣传劳动竞赛，使报纸成为推动劳动竞赛的强有力的武器。这是报纸以共产主义精神教育群众的一个极其重要的方面。
    报纸怎样通过劳动竞赛的宣传来向群众进行共产主义教育呢？根据“真理报”和“劳动报”的经验，主要地应该从以下几方面来进行。
    第一，要宣传群众为建设社会主义而英勇劳动的规模和成果。一九三二年苏联在生产农业机器方面和汽车制造业方面有了很大的发展。一九三二年十二月十九日，“真理报”就用专页宣传：“苏联用自己的拖拉机种地，用自己的汽车走路！”一九三二年十二月二十三日，“真理报”出了两版专页，专页的总标题是：“乌拉尔库茨克冶金联合企业的建成，是党的总路线的胜利”。在这个专页上，报道了从乌拉尔到西部西伯利亚广阔的地区内，几十个新的冶金企业、新的煤矿、新的有色金属矿场和新的大工业中心建设起来了。专页上还登了一副地图，标出企业的分布情况，很形象地告诉读者：苏联人用自己的劳动创造了多么大的工业地带。报纸上经常发表这一类的材料，就鼓舞了千百万工人群众建设社会主义的劳动热情。
    第二，要用群众创造性地参加社会主义建设的生动而鲜明的事例来教育群众。在进行共产主义教育时，报纸不但要使工人群众懂得共产主义的道理，而且要向他们提出共产主义劳动态度的榜样。报纸的任务，就是要学习列宁的“伟大的创举”一文所提示的光辉榜样，要从平凡的生活中选择范例来教育群众。“真理报”和苏联的其他报纸正是遵循着列宁的原则来报道劳动竞赛的。同时，苏联报纸无论过去和现在，还一直努力支持和发展群众对于劳动、对于公共财富的新的态度的萌芽。
    第三，要在报纸上研究、总结和推广先进生产者的经验。列宁就曾特别重视在报纸上宣传用新的方法进行工作。他说：“我们现在正是需要关怀那些异常珍贵的材料，也就是某些城市、某些企业和某些农村公社中的新生产组织经验，而使这个经验成为群众的财产。”〔注一〕按照列宁的指示，“真理报”和苏联其他报纸，几乎每天都在宣传和推广先进生产者的经验，并且更多地发现新的生产革新者。因为在遥远地区的先进工人和先进农民的经验，只有靠报纸才能把它们传播到全国各个地区去。在这方面，“真理报”和苏联的其他报纸，尽量想办法使先进生产者在报纸上发言，并且采取专页的形式来宣传他们的经验。
    第四，要积极地支持群众的创议。在竞赛中，随着人们劳动的积极性和创造性的不断的提高，必然将有大批创议涌现。这时，报纸就必须以非常细心、亲切和爱护的态度来对待和支持群众的创议。一九三○年四月二十二日列宁诞生六十周年纪念，
  “真理报”发表了“对领袖的最好的纪念”一文。在这篇文章中叙述了顿巴斯矿工所提出的创议，他们将超额完成建设计划来多修建一个以列宁为名的新矿山。这个创议在“真理报”的支持下，得到了全国煤矿工人和矿山机械制造厂工人的热烈响应。
  “真理报”所支持的顿巴斯矿工的这一创举，对于降低产品的成本、积累资金、开展社会主义竞赛以及鼓舞群众在社会主义建设中的英雄气概，都起了很大的作用。当然，报纸必须以切实负责的态度，来对待群众提出的创议。首先要把创议本身的事实调查清楚，并且要了解有关的党组织、工业主管机关和工会对它的估价，听取他们的意见。报纸应该支持一切先进的、有益处的建议，而不能盲目地不加分析和批判地沉醉于所有的建议。
    第五，要适当地宣传工人劳动条件的改善和生活福利的措施。苏联在第一个五年计划结束时，工业化和农业集体化的结果，使人民摆脱了一切剥削，大大提高了人民生活的水平。对于这一事实，“真理报”和苏联其他报纸，都曾大力宣传过。报纸注意了这一方面的宣传，就能使广大工人群众从他们自己的劳动中认识到，工业生产的目的不是别的，而是为了人及其需要；他们不是为别人做工，而是为自己做工。这样，就可以提高人们的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞人们积极地参加劳动竞赛。
    第六，要对生产工作中的具体缺点，进行不顾情面的批评。关于这一点，列宁在“苏维埃政权的当前任务”一文的初稿中说：“为了提高劳动者们的自治，为了转变那些一钱不值的旧工作态度，——或者是说那些资本主义社会里的磨洋工逃避工作的态度，我们所要使用的第一个最重要的手段便应该是报章。报章可以揭发每一个劳动公社里的经济生活中的缺点，无情地斥责这些缺点，公开地揭露我们经济生活中的一切毛病，这样，把这些缺点诉诸于全体劳动人民的公论面前以便求得根治。”〔注二〕
  “真理报”和苏联的其他报纸正是按照列宁的这一指示来作的。它们在宣传竞赛的同时，不断地开展批评和自我批评，教育人们养成新的劳动纪律和劳动态度；并且经常与一切保守的、腐朽的、停滞不前的现象作不屈不挠的尖锐的斗争。党依靠报纸所代表的社会舆论，来揭发和消除一切生产活动中的缺点和错误。在苏联，为了保卫党的利益，保卫国家和人民的利益，在报纸上所进行的批评是不客气的、不问对象的。报纸常常不顾情面地批评经济领导人员的缺点，批评工会组织和工人群众的缺点。一九二四年四月二日，“真理报”发表了以“向马特维夫这样的人开火”为题的社论。马特维夫是一个造纸厂的工人，他喝酒胡闹，在敌人唆使下破坏机器。这一期的报纸同时在另一篇文章中批评了一个叫斯垣开基的工人，他与工程师吵嘴后就不干活了。这些社论和文章发表后，工人们要求处分这些人，对他们实行法律的制裁。后来就这样做了，这就教育了千百万其他的人。在报纸上如果没有批评和自我批评，就不能以共产主义精神教育群众，不能推动工作前进。但是批评应该有根据，应该是公正的和实事求是的；同时批评也不应该是损伤人的自尊心的、侮辱人的，而应该是对人们有教育和警惕意义的。在批评缺点时不应忽视人们工作的成就，也不应该整天去指责别人的缺点而不反映缺点是怎样改正的。批评应该是帮助被批评者纠正缺点，改进我们的全部工作。
      “真理报”的经验说明，党的报纸向广大群众所进行的共产主义教育，是贯穿在各种具体问题中的理论与实际相联系的教育，这种教育必须是经常的、系统的、多方面的。要很好地实现这一任务，首先就要求报纸工作人员具有坚强的党性，忠实于党的报刊事业，并不断提高自己的思想水平，努力学习和掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，努力学习和贯彻党的政策。对于我们的工会报纸说来，更必须经常不断地加强和工人群众的联系，深入地研究工人群众的斗争和生活中发生的各种实际问题，并帮助工人群众用共产主义的精神来认识和解决这些问题。
