(Our Shenyang Dispatch, 8th) The Shenyang machinery and electrical factories affiliated with the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry have achieved new results in their labor emulation drive to welcome "May Day." As of the end of April, the total output value of each factory has exceeded the quota by an average of more than 5 percent.

Technical innovation movements in various factories have further developed in April. Workers in the five-meter vertical lathe group of the Heavy Machinery Plant, using double-tool cutting and the Kolesov tool method in the manufacture of large-scale mechanical equipment such as mine ball mills and gas generators, completed 283 percent of the production tasks for the first four months of this year as of the end of April. Calculated according to the existing quotas, this is equivalent to completing eleven months and ten days of work in four months. Li Hailan, a worker at the Transformer Factory, created a cold-working edging machine after creating a sandblasting machine, transforming heavy manual labor into mechanized production. The ranks of technical innovators in the factory continued to grow in April. The backbone technical innovators scattered in various workshops expanded from 70 to more than 100.

In April, the factories also trial-produced many new products, and some new products began to be mass-produced. The mobile belt conveyor successfully trial-produced by the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant is a mechanical device never before manufactured in China. The amount of transportation per day is equivalent to the amount moved by one hundred and twenty workers. Ten units, including the Dahuofang Reservoir project and Benxi Iron and Steel Company, have already placed orders with the factory. The "Baishan Brand" bicycle newly manufactured by the Bicycle Factory began mass production in April. The Fan Blower Factory strengthened the combination of production and sales in April. On the one hand, it trial-produced new products such as temperature-resistant blowers, high-pressure turbines, blowers, and automatic coal feeders. On the other hand, it took the initiative to promote products in various places. Therefore, in April, not only was the production plan completed one day ahead of schedule, but the sales plan and financial plan were also overfulfilled.

    开展技术革新的劳动竞赛又有新的成就
    【本报沈阳八日电】第一机械工业部所属沈阳机械、电工各厂在迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛中取得新成果。到四月底为止，各工厂的生产总值平均超额百分之五以上。
    各工厂的技术革新运动四月份有了进一步的发展。重型机器厂五公尺立式车床小组工人，在制造矿山球磨机、煤气发生炉等大型机械设备上，运用双刀切削和科列索夫车刀法，到四月底为止完成今年头四个月生产任务的百分之二百八十三。按现有定额计算，相当于以四个月的时间完成了十一个月零十天的工作量。变压器厂工人李海兰继创造吹砂机之后，又创造了冷作围沿机，使沉重的体力劳动一变而成机械化生产。该厂技术革新者的队伍四月份继续发展壮大。散布在各车间的技术革新骨干分子由七十人扩展到一百多名。
    四月份，各工厂又试制成了许多新产品，并有一些新产品开始大批生产。沈阳矿山机器厂试制成功的移动式皮带运输机是我国从未制造过的机械装置，一天的运输量就等于一百二十名工人的搬运量。现已有大伙房水库工程和本溪钢铁公司等十个单位向该厂订货。自行车厂新制造的“白山牌”自行车，四月份已开始大批生产。扇风机厂四月份加强产销的结合，一方面试制了耐温送风机、高压透平、送风机、自动打煤机等新产品，一方面主动到各地推销产品。因此，四月份不但提前一天完成了生产计划，销售计划和财务计划也超额完成了。
