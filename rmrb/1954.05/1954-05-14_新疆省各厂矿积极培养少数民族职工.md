Factories and mines in Xinjiang Province are actively cultivating ethnic minority staff and workers. Currently, ethnic minority employees in factories and mines in Urumqi account for more than 20% of the total number of employees, an increase of nearly two times compared to 1951.

Last year, Xinjiang Province sent 110 ethnic minority workers with specialized skills to factories and mines across the country for further study. Among them, some went to Suzhou, Jiangsu, to learn modern silk reeling techniques, and others went to the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui to learn new coal mining techniques and production management. The Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Joint Stock Company, in order to vigorously cultivate ethnic minority employees, held specialized spare-time training classes and invited Soviet experts to lecture. According to preliminary statistics, the company has trained a large number of technical personnel and workers of all ethnic groups in the three years since its establishment. The Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company has also trained a large number of technical personnel and workers of all ethnic groups in the more than three years since its establishment. The Xinjiang "July 1st" Cotton Textile Factory recruited 50 ethnic minority female workers this year. After three months of training, most of the female workers have initially mastered operational techniques such as spinning and weaving.

    新疆省各厂矿积极培养少数民族职工
    新疆省各厂矿积极培养少数民族职员和工人。目前，乌鲁木齐市各厂矿的少数民族职工约占全体职工总数的百分之二十以上，较一九五一年增加了将近两倍。
    新疆省去年送往祖国各地厂矿学习的专业民族职工有一百一十名。其中有到江苏苏州学习现代化缫丝技术的，有到安徽淮南煤矿学习新式采煤技术和生产管理的。中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司为了大力培养民族职工，曾举办了专业的业余训练班，请苏联专家讲课。据初步统计：该公司成立三年来，已培养出大批各民族技术人员和工人。中苏石油股份公司成立三年多以来，也培养出大批各族技术人员和工人。新疆“七一”棉纺织厂今年招收了五十名少数民族女工，经过三个月训练，大部分女工已初步掌握了纺纱、织布等操作技术。
