Gansu Province Zhangye Farm is expanding its hog raising plan to strive to hand over more meat to the state. Currently, the Zhangye Farm has raised more than 490 hogs, more than 300 more than last year, most of which weigh between 80 and 120 jin. If state-owned and local state-owned farms in Gansu Province all complete their hog raising plans like Zhangye Farm, they can hand over more than 3 million jin of pork and a large quantity of hog bristles to the state each year. Recently, the Zhangye Farm has also sent people to pig-producing areas in Minle County to purchase piglets, planning to raise another batch in May. In order to gradually improve the breed of hogs, the Zhangye Farm transported Berkshire and Yorkshire excellent pig breeds from Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, in April this year, preparing to promote them.

    甘肃省张掖农场增养毛猪
    国营甘肃省张掖农场扩大喂养毛猪计划，争取向国家上缴更多肉食。目前，张掖农场已养猪四百九十多头，比去年多三百多头，其中多数体重都是八十斤到一百二十斤。如果甘肃省国营和地方国营的农场都像张掖农场完成养猪计划，一年便可向国家上缴三百多万斤猪肉和大批猪鬃。最近张掖农场又派人到民乐县产猪地区采购小猪，计划五月份再增养一批。为了逐渐改良毛猪品种，张掖农场今年四月从陕西省武功县一带运来巴克夏和约克夏优良猪种，准备推广。　（新华社）
