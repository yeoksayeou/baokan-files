Rural supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Northwest China are vigorously carrying out the supply of draft animals this year. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang and the city of Xi'an as of early May, 9,443 draft animals have been supplied to farmers, exceeding the original supply plan.

Due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the demand for farmers to purchase draft animals is unprecedentedly urgent this year. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have greatly improved their methods of operating draft animals. Generally, investigations and registrations are carried out in advance to understand the types and specifications of draft animals required by farmers. Therefore, the draft animals purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places sell quickly. In February, the Chang'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaanxi Province transported 40 draft animals each to the Weiqu and Sanqiao districts, which were snapped up in two hours. On April 15, the Qishan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative transported 50 head of draft cattle from Luohe. More than 400 farmers came to select and inspect them from morning to night. The Li Wenzhen mutual aid group in the fifth district of the county ordered three head at once. In less than two days, all the cattle were sold out.

In order to reduce the price of draft cattle, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places generally adopt the operating method of using mass funds as the main source and self-raised funds as a supplement, so that the price of each draft animal is generally 10% to 20% lower than the local market price, which is warmly welcomed by farmers.

At present, many farmers are still requesting the supply of draft animals. According to the statistics of the People's Representatives Conference of Tianshui County, Gansu Province, the local people requested the supply of more than 3,000 head of draft cattle. To this end, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are continuing to organize sources of goods and vigorously carry out the supply of draft animals.

    西北区各地供销合作社供应农民大批耕畜
    西北区各地农村供销合作社，今年大力展开耕畜供应工作。据陕西、甘肃、宁夏、新疆四省及西安市截至五月初的不完全统计，已供应农民耕畜九千四百四十三头。超过了原订供应计划。
    由于互助合作运动的开展，今年西北地区农民添置耕畜的要求空前迫切，同时各地供销合作社经营耕畜的方法也有很大改进，一般事先都进行了调查、登记，掌握了农民需要耕畜的种类和规格，因此，各地供销合作社采购的耕畜都销售很快。陕西省长安县供销合作社二月间运到韦曲、三桥两区各四十头耕畜，两个钟头就被争购一空。岐山县供销合作社在四月十五日由漯河运到五十头耕牛，从早到晚来选看的农民有四百多人。该县第五区李文桢互助组一次就订购了三头。不到两天，这批耕牛即全部卖完。
    各地供销合作社为了降低耕牛价格，一般都采用了以群众资金为主、自筹资金为辅的经营方法，使每头耕畜的价格一般低于当地市价百分之十至二十左右，受到农民热烈欢迎。
    目前，许多农民还要求供应耕畜。据甘肃省天水县人民代表会议的统计，当地群众即要求供应耕牛三千多头。为此，各地供销合作社还在继续组织货源，大力进行耕畜供应工作。
