Heilongjiang Province has seen great development in animal husbandry in recent years. The number of cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys in the province is now 82.1 percent higher than in 1949, with horses increasing by 62.4 percent. There have also been significant increases in sheep and pigs. The income from animal husbandry accounts for more than 22 percent of the total agricultural income.

The development of animal husbandry is not only increasing in quantity but also gradually improving in quality. Keshan and Baiquan counties are using "Don River" and "Kabajin" stallions, while Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Anda, and Lanxi are using Soviet "Draft" and "Vladimir" stallions to improve horse quality, and have achieved great results. The province has now bred more than 2,000 improved foals of the Soviet "Don River" and "Kabajin" breeds through artificial insemination.

Socialist animal husbandry has also made great progress. State-owned Sartu Stud Farm, Keshan Stud Farm, and state-owned farms' animal husbandry have all improved to varying degrees. The Qiqihar Pig Breeding Farm has been basically completed and has bred a number of breeding pigs, which have been promoted to various counties. In recent years, the Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to helping farmers develop animal husbandry production. Up to last year, the province had issued a total of 96 billion yuan in loans related to the development of animal husbandry, transferred more than 1,100 animal husbandry technical cadres, organized and trained more than 1,500 folk veterinarians, and established 39 animal husbandry and veterinary guidance stations, 87 animal husbandry and veterinary guidance stations, and more than 100 livestock hygiene clinics in various places. In recent years, more than 705 head of large livestock such as horses and cattle have been injected with medicines, which has basically stopped the local epidemic of large livestock diseases in some areas.

    黑龙江省畜牧业几年来有很大发展
    黑龙江省几年来畜牧业有很大发展。现在全省牛、马、骡、驴已比一九四九年增加百分之八十二点一，其中马匹增加百分之六十二点四，绵羊、猪等也都有显著的增加。畜牧业的收入占农业收入比重的百分之二十二多。
    畜牧事业的发展，不仅在数量上增多，质量上也逐渐有所提高。克山、拜泉两县用“顿河”“卡巴金”种马，肇东、肇州、安达、兰西用苏联“拉车”“富拉基米尔”种马进行改良马质，都收到了很大效果。现在全省已繁殖了两千多匹用人工配种的苏联“顿河”“卡巴金”种改良小马。
    社会主义性质的畜牧事业也有很大的发展。国营萨尔图种畜场、克山种马场和国营农场畜牧业都有了不同程度的提高。齐齐哈尔种猪场已经基本建成，并培育了一部分种猪，推广到各县。几年来，党和人民政府非常重视帮助农民发展畜牧业生产。到去年为止，全省共发放了九百六十亿元有关发展畜牧业的贷款，调配了一千一百多名畜牧技术干部，组织和训练了一千五百多名民间兽医，并在各地成立了三十九个畜牧兽医指导所、八十七个畜牧兽医指导站和一百多个家畜卫生院。几年来用药剂注射马、牛等大牲畜，就达七百零五头次，在有些地方基本制止了当地流行的大牲畜症。
