National Railway Passenger Trains
　　Will Implement Summer Timetable
　　The national railway passenger trains will implement a summer timetable starting at 00:00 on May 21st. This summer schedule change involves partial alterations in train categories and times. For example, the No. 105 and No. 106 passenger trains between Beijing and Xi'an will be changed to express trains to facilitate long-distance travel, reducing travel time by 3 hours and 4 minutes from Beijing to Xi'an, and 4 hours and 26 minutes from Xi'an to Beijing. To accommodate passengers going to Beidaihe for summer vacation on Sundays or holidays, the No. 33 and No. 34 trains between Beijing and Shanhaiguan are scheduled to depart from Beijing at 22:20, arrive at Beidaihe at 6:06, depart from Beidaihe at 22:37, and return to Beijing at 6:14. Starting from June 15th, the No. 21 and No. 22 express trains between Beijing and Qingdao will have sleeper cars added specifically for summer vacation use. To alleviate the phenomenon of excessive passenger crowding, other trains will also further strengthen the organization of passenger boarding and appropriately increase the number of carriages.

    全国铁路旅客列车
    将实行夏令时刻
    全国铁路旅客列车自五月二十一日零点起实行夏季时刻，此次夏季改点，在列车种别和时刻等方面有部分改变。如北京西安间一零五、一零六次旅客列车为便于长途旅行将改为快车，旅行时间北京西安间缩短三点零四分，西安北京间缩短四点二十六分。为照顾星期日或假日旅客们往北戴河避暑，北京山海关间三十三、三十四次定在北京二十二点二十分开，六点零六分到北戴河，二十二点三十七分由北戴河开，六点十四分返北京。自六月十五日起北京青岛二十一、二十二次快车加挂有专供避暑乘用之卧车。为缓和旅客过分拥挤的现象，其他各列车也都进一步加强对旅客乘车的组织工作，并适当的增加了车辆。
