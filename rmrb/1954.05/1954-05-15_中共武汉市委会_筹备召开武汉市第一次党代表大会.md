The CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee has decided to convene the First Wuhan Municipal Party Congress on May 24th. The central agenda of the meeting is to summarize the work of the Municipal Committee in 1953, determine the tasks for 1954, and elect the leading body of the Wuhan Party organization – the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line during the transition period and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee.

In April, the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee made a resolution to convene the Wuhan Municipal Party Congress, giving specific instructions on how to prepare for the meeting. At the same time, it resolved to form a preparatory committee for the congress, composed of sixteen people, including Zhang Pinghua, Second Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary, Zhao Min, First Deputy Secretary, and Standing Committee member Song Kanfu, to be responsible for leading the preparatory work.

The convocation of the First Wuhan Municipal Party Congress is a major event in the Party life of the entire city of Wuhan. It has aroused the concern and attention of Party members throughout the city and has further stimulated their political enthusiasm. The broad masses of Party members have responded to the call of the Municipal Committee and actively participated in the election of delegates. By the beginning of May, the work of electing delegates by Party committees at all levels had been successfully completed. A total of 449 official delegates and 46 alternate delegates were elected throughout the city. Party committees at all levels convened Party member meetings, conscientiously and responsibly discussed the list of delegate candidates, and enthusiastically conducted the elections. The broad masses of Party members carefully entrusted their wishes and opinions to the delegates. For example, in the process of deliberating and electing delegates in the grassroots Party organizations of the transportation system, Party members seriously and specifically pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of the candidates, so that the candidates and all Party members received a profound education on the Party's democratic centralism and the development of criticism and self-criticism, and further strengthened the Party's unity. The delegates elected in this serious manner include not only Party cadres at all levels who work diligently to serve the people and are loved by the masses, but also a large number of outstanding Party members from workers and peasants fighting on various economic construction fronts. At present, Party organizations throughout the city are actively carrying out the work of deliberation and collection of proposals. (Report from our Central and Southern China reporter station)

    中共武汉市委会
    筹备召开武汉市第一次党代表大会
    中共武汉市委会决定于五月二十四日召开武汉市第一次党代表大会。会议中心议题，是根据党在国家过渡时期的总路线和七届四中全会决议的精神，总结市委一九五三年的工作，确定一九五四年的任务，并选举武汉市党组织的领导机关——中共武汉市委会。
    中共武汉市委会于四月间作出了召开武汉市党代表大会的决议，对如何做好会议准备工作作了具体指示。同时决议由市委第二书记张平化、第一副书记李尔重、第一副书记赵敏、常委宋侃夫等十六人组成大会筹备委员会，负责领导进行筹备工作。
    召开武汉市第一次党代表大会，是全武汉市党的生活中的一件大事。它已引起了全市党员的关心和注意，并进一步启发了党员的政治积极性。广大党员响应市委的号召，积极地参加了选举代表的活动。到五月初，各级党委选举大会代表的工作已经胜利结束。全市共选出正式代表四百四十九名、候补代表四十六名。各级党委都分别召开党员大会，以严肃负责的态度，认真地讨论了代表候选人名单，热烈地进行了选举。广大党员都把自己的愿望和意见慎重地付托给代表们。如交通运输系统的各基层党组织，在酝酿选举代表的过程中，党员们认真、具体地指出了候选人的优点和缺点，使候选人及全体党员都受到了一次深刻的党的民主集中制和开展批评与自我批评的教育，并进一步增强了党的团结。这样认真选出来的代表，其中不但有勤勤恳恳地为人民服务并为群众所爱戴的各级党员干部，而且还有大批战斗在各个经济建设战线上的工人和农民中的优秀党员。目前，全市党组织正积极进行酝酿和搜集提案的工作。　（本报中南记者站）
