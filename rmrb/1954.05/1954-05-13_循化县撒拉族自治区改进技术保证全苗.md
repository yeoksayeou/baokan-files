The People's Government of the Salar Autonomous Region in Xunhua County, Qinghai Province, strengthened key leadership in leading spring plowing and production, went deep into the fields, and helped farmers improve farming techniques, ensuring full seedling emergence for crops.

The Salar Autonomous Region designated Xiabaizhuang in Baizhuang Township and the Chang Sihi year-round mutual aid team as key points, strengthening production leadership. It was discovered that local farmers were accustomed to plowing once every autumn, scattering seeds in the spring, and then plowing them into the soil. The sowing rate was about 32 to 35 catties per mu, equivalent to about 440,000 to 500,000 seeds, which should not have resulted in missing seedlings. However, due to excessive floating seeds, the phenomenon of missing seedlings still occurred. According to this situation, the district people's government analyzed and studied and believed that the reason for the excessive floating seeds was the rough plowing during sowing, with many soil clods and uneven sowing. If the floating seeds are calculated at 15 percent, more than 14,500 catties of seeds would be wasted in the more than 3,200 mu of land in Baizhuang Township. Another reason for the lack of seedlings is that there is seed leakage on both sides of the land, with an average of about 300 square feet of seed leakage per mu.

After finding out the reason for the missing seedlings, the district people's government immediately consulted with the masses and decided to break the soil once before and after spring sowing to reduce floating seeds, and to replant on the edges of the fields. The ground of the Zhang Sixi mutual aid team after breaking the soil clods was flat, and the average number of floating seeds per square foot of land was reduced to 36. Then, 82 people, including the heads of mutual aid teams, township heads, and work team leaders from the four townships in the district, were convened to observe the land of the Zhang Sixi mutual aid team and compare it with the surrounding land, introduced the working methods, and dispelled the concerns of some people that breaking soil clods would solidify the land, harm the seeds, and make it impossible to irrigate. Han Yingxuan, secretary of the district party committee, immediately called on the farmers in the district to mobilize to break soil clods and replant. Due to the leading role of party members, league members, and activists, 70 percent of the farmers in Xiabaizhuang Village went to the fields to break soil clods the next day. More than 700 mu were broken in two days, accounting for more than 60 percent of the area of ​​the district's land. Most of the mutual aid teams and individual farmers carried out replanting, which played a great role in ensuring full seedling emergence. (Our Northwest Reporter Station)

    循化县撒拉族自治区改进技术保证全苗
    青海省循化县撒拉族自治区人民政府在领导春耕生产中，由于加强重点领导，深入田间，帮助农民改进耕作技术，保证了庄稼全苗。
    撒拉族自治区确定以白庄乡下白庄和张四喜常年互助组为重点，加强了生产领导，发现当地农民习惯每年秋耕一次，春天撒籽，然后犁翻入土，每亩播种量在三十二斤到三十五斤左右，约合四十四万粒到五十万粒，本不应缺苗，但由于浮籽过多，还发生缺苗现象。区人民政府根据这一情况进行分析研究，认为浮籽多的原因是播种时犁的粗糙，土块多，撒籽不匀。浮籽若以百分之十五计，白庄乡三千二百多亩地要浪费种籽一万四千五百斤左右。缺苗的另一原因是地两边有漏种情况，平均每亩漏种约有三百平方市尺。
    找出缺苗原因后，区人民政府即和群众商量，决定在春播前后碎土一遍，减少浮籽，在地边进行补种。张四喜互助组打过土块的地，地面平整，平均每平方尺地浮籽减少到三十六粒。接着就召集了全区四个乡的互助组长、乡长、工作组长等共八十二人，观摩了张四喜互助组的地，并与周围的地作了对比，介绍了工作方法，解除了一些人怕打土块会把地打实，怕伤种籽以及浇不上水等顾虑。区委书记韩应选立即号召全区农民动员起来进行打土块和补种，由于党员、团员、积极分子带头，第二天下白庄村百分之七十的农户都下地打土块。两天共打七百多亩，占该区土地面积百分之六十以上，大部分互助组和单干农民都进行了补种，对于保证全苗起了很大作用。（本报西北记者站）
