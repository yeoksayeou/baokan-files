Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: Ruan Mengwu, an engineer at the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, has recently succeeded in developing reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds, following his invention of the electric scraper combined coal loader. This is a significant improvement in the coal mining industry. Replacing wooden pillars and canopies in mine roadways with these sheds can save substantial amounts of timber and labor for support, thereby reducing coal mining costs. After the comprehensive promotion of this type of shed in the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, the annual consumption of pit props alone can be reduced by 10 billion yuan. If universally implemented in coal mines nationwide, it is estimated that the annual savings on pit props could reach 300 billion yuan. Furthermore, the use of reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds can increase support strength and ensure the safety of roadways. Currently, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has manufactured fifty reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds, preparing for their formal use in the Fourteenth Main Roadway of the Wangfeng Mine, where pressure is relatively high.

Pit props are the most essential material in coal mining production, accounting for a large proportion of coal mining costs. A mine producing two million tons of coal annually consumes one million round logs. Engineer Ruan Mengwu of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, responding to the government's call for timber conservation, began experimenting with reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds in 1952. This experiment received strong support from the leaders of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, the Coal Mine Management Bureau, and the Central South Coal Mine Administration. The Coal Mine Management Bureau allocated special funds for the experiment in 1952, and the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau also convened coal mining and civil engineering technicians to assist in the research.

The reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete shed is made of cement, yellow sand, stone chips, rebar, lead wire, tung oil, bamboo reinforcement, and other materials, with each frame costing 396,000 yuan. It consists of one beam and two columns, and the most economical cross-section can be selected based on the specific conditions of each mine, such as ground pressure. The beam portion is mainly to resist the pressure of the roadway roof, and due to the high pressure it receives, a pure reinforced concrete structure is used. The column portion receives less pressure and uses a hybrid structure of steel and bamboo reinforcement. Reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds have characteristics such as being resistant to decay and having high support capacity. Their support force can be designed according to different situations and can be used for at least two years, or up to ten years or more. In roadways with stable ground pressure, low pressure, and the need for long-term maintenance, the use of reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds can avoid repairs and replacements for a long time, resulting in greater cost savings. It can also save labor for underground support and reduce the burden on railways for transporting timber. In addition, the adoption of reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds plays a significant role in safe production. The reinforced concrete and bamboo concrete sheds currently manufactured by the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau support a top pressure of 5.5 metric tons per frame, which is 440% higher than the top pressure supported by wooden sheds of the same specification, thus effectively ensuring safety.

    焦作矿务局工程师阮孟武制成钢筋竹筋水泥棚
    全国煤矿采用后一年可节约坑木值三千亿
    【新华社二十日讯】焦作矿务局工程师阮孟武继创制电扒联合装煤机后，最近又试制钢筋竹筋水泥棚成功。这是煤矿工业的一项重大改进。用这种棚子代替矿井巷道的木柱顶棚，可节约大量的木材和支柱人工，降低采煤成本。这种棚子在焦作矿务局全面推广以后，仅坑木消耗全年就可以节约一百亿元；如在全国煤矿普遍推行，估计一年节约的坑木可达三千亿元。同时，使用钢筋竹筋水泥棚，可以增加支柱强度，保障巷道的安全。现在，焦作矿务局已经制造了五十架钢筋竹筋水泥棚，准备在王封矿压力比较大的十四大巷正式使用。
    坑木是煤矿生产中最主要的材料，占煤矿生产成本的很大比重，以一个生产二百万吨煤的矿来说，每年就要消耗一百万根圆木。焦作矿务局工程师阮孟武响应政府关于节约木材的号召，从一九五二年起就开始试验钢筋竹筋水泥棚，这一试验曾得到中央人民政府燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局、中南煤矿管理局领导上的大力支持；煤矿管理总局在一九五二年拨给专款进行试验；焦作矿务局也召集采煤和土木建筑工程技术人员协助研究。
    钢筋竹筋水泥棚是用水泥、黄沙、石碴、钢筋、铅丝、桐油、竹筋等制成，每架成本是三十九万六千元。它是由一根梁二根柱组成，可根据各矿地压大小等具体情况，选择最经济的截面，其中梁部分以抵抗巷道顶板压力为主，因所受压力较大，纯用钢筋混凝土结构。柱的所受压力较小部分，采用钢筋竹筋混合结构。钢筋竹筋水泥棚具有不易腐朽、支撑能力大等特点，其支撑力可以根据不同情况设计，最少可用二年，多的可达十多年。在地压稳定、压力不大而需要经久维持的巷道，使用钢筋竹筋水泥棚，可以长期不修换，对于节约成本收效更大，还可节省井下支柱人工，为铁路节省了铁路运木材的负担。此外，采用钢筋竹筋水泥棚对于安全生产作用很大。焦作矿务局现制的钢筋竹筋水泥棚，每棚支持顶压五点五公吨，比同规格木棚支持顶压提高百分之四百四十，因此有力地保障了安全。
