Large numbers of steamships are towing timber on the Songhua River
    This year in Songjiang Province, 93% of the timber floated on the Songhua River will be transported by steamship. The Yilan Forestry Bureau will rely entirely on steamship transportation this year.

    For many years, the forest resources on the southern slope of the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Laoye Ridge Mountains in the province have been felled and relied on mountain streams to float them to the mouth of the Songhua River. Then, they have been rafted by manpower, which is inefficient and not very safe. Using steamships to tow rafts can ensure the connection of the processes of river exit, return to the timber yard, and timber production. At the same time, it can greatly reduce the physical labor of the rafting workers and avoid personal accidents that may occur in the event of storms during rafting.

    Recently, the staff of the steamship department of the Yilan Forestry Bureau have voluntarily increased the new quota for steamship towing. The towing capacity of general steamships has increased from 500 to 800 cubic meters last year to 1,300 to 1,500 cubic meters. They have also proposed adding a sailor to each steamship to allow the steamships to tow timber day and night.

### 松花江上大批汽船拖运木材

    松花江上大批汽船拖运木材
    松江省今年在松花江上流送的木材，将有百分之九十三要用汽船拖运。依兰森林工业局今年完全用汽船拖运。
    许多年以来，该省小兴安岭南坡和老爷岭山脉的森林资源，采伐以后，都依靠山涧河水流送到松花江口，再依靠人力放排，效率很低，而且不很安全。利用汽船拖排，可以保证出河、归楞、制材等工序的衔接。同时，可大大减轻流送工人的体力劳动，避免放排中途遇到暴风雨可能发生的人身事故。
    依兰森林工业局汽船部的职工们，最近自动提高了汽船拖排的新定额，一般汽船的拖运量由去年的五百到八百立方公尺提高到一千三百到一千五百立方公尺。他们又提出每条汽船增加一名水手，让汽船昼夜不停地拖运。
