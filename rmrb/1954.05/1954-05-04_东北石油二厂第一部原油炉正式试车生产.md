Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, May 3rd: The first crude oil furnace restored by Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 2 officially started trial production at 5:00 AM on April 29th. The situation has been good since the trial run. Workers especially carried the first kilogram of crude oil produced during the May Day International Labor Day parade.

On the first night of igniting the crude oil gas generator, the factory director, engineers, and workshop directors directed the workers overnight to adjust the fire bed and repair the problems that occurred in the pipeline during the trial operation. When the exhaust fan for the crude oil output started, the whole factory was silent. When the exhaust fan sent the gas to the cooling tower to turn it into crude oil flowing into the oil tank, the workers roared and cheered: "Oil is coming out!" "Oil is coming out!"

The time from furnace baking to oil output for the crude oil system took more than ten days in the puppet Manchuria period; however, this time it only took five days, and crude oil flowed out continuously.

    东北石油二厂第一部原油炉正式试车生产
    据新华社抚顺三日电：东北石油二厂恢复的第一部原油炉子，已在四月二十九日早晨五时正式试车生产。试车以来，情况良好。工人们特别在“五一”国际劳动节日抬着生产出来的第一公斤原油，参加了游行。
    在原油煤气发生炉点火的第一天晚上，厂长、工程师和车间主任连夜指挥工人一面调整火层，一面修好管道在试运转中发生的毛病。当出原油的排风机开动起来时，全厂肃无人声。在排风机将瓦斯送到冷却塔变成原油流到油槽时，工人们就轰然雷动地欢呼：“油出来了！”“油出来了！”
    原油系统从烘炉到出油的时间，在伪满时期要十多天；可是，这次仅仅五天，就源源地流出原油来了。
