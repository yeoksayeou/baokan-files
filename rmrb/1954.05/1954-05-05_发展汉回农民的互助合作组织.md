    Develop Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations for Han and Hui Peasants

    China's Hui population numbers around five million. While some are concentrated in the Northwest, in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and other places, the majority are scattered throughout the country and live alongside Han people. The Hui people who live scattered in the countryside suffered under the oppression and exploitation of the feudal landlord class before liberation, just like the Han peasants. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Han and Hui peasants united, overthrew the common enemy—the landlord class, implemented land reform, and obtained the means of production.

    However, the Hui people scattered in the countryside mostly engaged in small businesses in the past, and generally had less land than the Han people, lacked draught animals, farm tools, and farming techniques. Therefore, they faced some difficulties in production and in their lives to varying degrees. The Party and the People's Government, as well as the Han people, have a responsibility to help solve these difficulties. The best way to help Hui peasants solve their difficulties is to lead the Han and Hui peasants to jointly organize mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. The facts published in today's newspaper about the joint organization of production cooperatives by Han and Hui peasants in many rural areas of Hebei and Shandong fully illustrate this point.

    Through the agricultural production cooperatives jointly organized by Han and Hui peasants, the Hui peasants have learned and improved their farming techniques with the help of Han peasants, and have solved, to a certain extent, the difficulties such as insufficient livestock, farm tools and land. They have achieved increased production and improved their living conditions, just like the Han peasants. Moreover, the two ethnic groups have enhanced political unity on the basis of mutual assistance and mutual respect for customs and habits, creating favorable conditions for implementing the general task of the country's transition period in the vast rural areas. Therefore, this practice of joint organization of mutual aid and cooperation by Han and Hui peasants should be promoted. Of course, it is also necessary to adhere to the principles of "voluntary participation" and "mutual benefit" here, and there should be no coercion; and special attention should be paid to continuously conducting education on national unity and mutual respect for customs and habits among the two ethnic groups.

    发展汉回农民的互助合作组织
    我国回民有五百万人左右，除一部分聚居在西北甘肃、宁夏、青海等地外，大部分散在全国各地和汉民杂居。其中散居在农村中的回民，在解放以前和汉族农民同样受着封建地主阶级的压迫和剥削。解放后，在共产党和人民政府领导下，汉、回两族农民团结起来，打倒了共同敌人——地主阶级，实行了土地改革，获得了生产资料。
    但是散居在农村中的回民，过去多经营小商业，一般比汉民土地少，缺乏耕畜农具和耕种技术，因此生产上和生活上都或多或少地存在着若干困难。对于这些困难，党和人民政府以及汉族人民有责任帮助解决。帮助回族农民解决困难的最好办法，就是领导汉、回两族农民联合组织互助组和农业生产合作社。今天本报发表的河北、山东不少农村汉回农民联合组织生产合作社的事实，充分说明了这一点。
    经过汉回农民联合组织的农业生产合作社，回族农民在汉族农民帮助下学会了和提高了耕作技术，在一定程度上解决了牲畜农具和土地不足等困难，和汉族农民一样得到了增产，改善了生活。而且，两族农民在互相帮助和互相尊重风俗习惯的基础上，增强了政治上的团结，为在广大农村中贯彻国家过渡时期的总任务创造了有利的条件。因此，这种汉回农民联合组织互助合作的作法是应该提倡的。当然，这里同样需要遵守“自愿”和“互利”的原则，不能有任何勉强；而且应该特别注意不断地对两族农民进行民族团结的教育和互相尊重风俗习惯的教育。
