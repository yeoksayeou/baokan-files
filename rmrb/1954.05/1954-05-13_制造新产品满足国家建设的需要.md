Manufacturing New Products to Meet the Needs of National Construction

Glass Drawing Machine

To support the peaceful construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, workers at the state-owned Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced an automated glass drawing machine, which is now being packed and shipped to Qinhuangdao for testing.

The glass drawing machine is an essential machine for manufacturing various types of flat glass, and China has never manufactured it before. The glass drawing machine manufactured by the factory can produce flat glass (with a thickness of 2 to 6 millimeters, a width of 2.3 meters, and a length as needed), with an average hourly output of 100 square meters. During the trial production, the workers came up with various methods to overcome difficulties in technology and equipment. The Wang Siwu group in the comprehensive workshop used a gantry crane instead of a lathe, solving the processing difficulties of the gearbox; technician Sun Haiyue and worker Du Lao jointly studied and found the center points of fourteen pairs of asbestos rollers, ensuring the parallelism and perpendicularity of the machine body, and successfully completed the assembly task. On May 5, the factory held a celebration meeting for the successful manufacturing of the glass drawing machine. Li Yunhua, the commercial attache of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, also attended the celebration.

Gasoline Engine Suitable for Screening Films

Workers at the state-owned Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi Province, according to the model of a gasoline engine made in East Germany, manufactured a four-horsepower gasoline engine, and began mass production in April this year. This small power machinery weighs 20 kilograms and, with the addition of power distribution equipment, becomes a 1.5 kVA portable gasoline generator. It is suitable for rural mobile projection teams to screen movies, and can also be used for lighting, driving water pumps, and air compressors. Currently, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has ordered a large number of machines from the factory.

"1325" Type Soviet-Style Hexagonal Lathe

China's first "1325" type Soviet-style hexagonal lathe has been successfully manufactured at the state-owned Nanjing Machine Tool Factory.

This lathe can be equipped with twelve different tools for cutting, while ordinary lathes can only be equipped with four; its headstock speed also exceeds that of ordinary lathes, reaching more than 1,300 revolutions per minute; the lathe is also equipped with safety devices, which can reduce accidents, which is not available in ordinary lathes.

The successful manufacturing of the "1325" type lathe is the first good news for the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory in adapting to the needs of national industrial construction and carrying out multi-variety production. While this lathe was still being manufactured, ten units including Guangzhou Steam Turbine Factory, Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory, and Harbin Electric Machine Factory had pre-ordered goods from them.

High-Pressure Acid-Resistant Blower

The Shanghai Joint State-Private Tianyuan Tianli Electro-Chemical Plant has successfully trial-produced a high-pressure acid-resistant blower.

The high-pressure acid-resistant blower is an indispensable machine in the chemical industry. It is more resistant to corrosion than ordinary blowers. In the past, all the high-pressure blowers used in China's chemical plants were bought from abroad.

The self-made high-pressure acid-resistant blower has increased the air volume per minute by one-third compared to the American-made one, and the air pressure has also increased by nearly one time compared to the American-made one. Therefore, the output is high and the cost is low. In 1950, it cost 90 million yuan to buy an American-made 6-inch low-pressure blower (cheaper than high-pressure), while the cost of China's self-made high-pressure acid-resistant blower is only over 30 million yuan.

Countercurrent Centrifugal Extraction Machine for Manufacturing Penicillin

The state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory has successfully trial-produced a countercurrent centrifugal extraction machine for manufacturing penicillin (penicillin) designed by itself, and will be officially put into production in May.

In the past, the factory used disc extraction machines to extract penicillin, but because the efficiency was poor, the recovery rate was generally only about 70%. The now-made countercurrent extraction machine can fully extract penicillin from the raw liquid. According to the test results, the recovery rate can reach at least 85% or more, and the consumption of solvent is also significantly reduced compared to the past. According to the factory's expanded production, using this extraction machine can produce penicillin for more than 7 million patients every year without increasing raw materials, and can also save more than 40,000 gallons of solvent, saving a total cost of more than 30 billion yuan. More importantly, this mechanical structure is relatively simple and can be manufactured domestically, which not only saves the country a batch of foreign exchange during the expansion, but also creates conditions for the development of China's penicillin manufacturing industry.

Air-Cooled Mercury Vacuum Pump

The substation of the Shenyang Tram Factory used water-cooled mercury vacuum pumps in the past. Because these equipments have been used for too long, a failure will affect the operation of the city's trams. In order to avoid this situation, Pan Baoyue, the deputy director of the factory, and old workers and engineers of the substation jointly studied and trial-produced an air-cooled mercury vacuum pump in mid-April, and the test results were good. During the trial production, the workers overcame many difficulties in materials and technology.

Ore Dressing Machine

The Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced ore dressing machine equipment for the first time. This ore dressing machine includes more than 60 machines of different types (more than 20 types); the operation process is divided into five processes: crushing, screening, and conveying minerals, which completely replaces manual ore dressing. After the factory accepted the task of manufacturing ore dressing machine equipment in September last year, it revised the drawings five times to ensure quality. In April this year, the workers put forward 22 rationalization proposals around key issues in one month. In the manufacturing process, everyone used advanced Soviet experience to solve many technical difficulties.

On April 24, the factory held a test run ceremony, and the machine was running very well. This set of ore dressing machine only needs 12 people to operate, which replaces the work of 1,100 people. The recovery rate has also increased from 50% by hand to 85% to 95%.

6.3-Ton Battery Locomotive

The Dalian-Lushun Transportation Company Tram Factory successfully trial-produced a 6.3-ton battery locomotive for Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

The 6.3-ton battery locomotive is used to pull ore, and can travel 5 kilometers per hour, with a traction force of 10,080 kg and a traction weight of 40 tons.

The parts of this locomotive are very complicated, with 400 to 500 kinds of parts for the body alone, and more than 300 drawings. In the trial production process, they overcame many difficulties. For example, when technician Xu Yun was designing the battery locomotive drawings, he encountered difficulties in calculating the characteristic curve and traction. He referred to the relevant Soviet mine locomotive trial production materials to solve this difficulty. When surveying and mapping the battery locomotive, the engineers solved the difficulty of not having a platform tool and completed the external surveying and mapping of the battery locomotive one and a half days ahead of schedule.

Steel Arch Frame

A new product of great significance to China's railway new line bridge engineering and to saving steel - a steel arch frame - has been successfully trial-produced at the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory of the Ministry of Railways and has begun mass production.

The steel arch frame is a steel frame used in the construction of stone arch bridges. In the past, railway new lines usually used steel structure bridges, which required hundreds or thousands of tons of steel. Using steel arch frames to build railway stone arch bridges can make full use of the mountain stones near the new line construction site; at the same time, this steel arch frame, like the model board used in general basic construction projects, can be dismantled and used on another bridge hole after the stone arch bridge is grouted and solidified. And, because its height is accurate, it can fully guarantee the quality of the bridge.

Now, the first batch of 330 tons of steel arch frames made by the workers of the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory has been shipped out to be used by the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government for the construction of new line bridges. The factory has also accepted orders from other new line engineering bureaus and is continuing to produce them in batches.

    制造新产品满足国家建设的需要
    玻璃引上机
    为支援朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的和平建设，国营太原矿山机器厂职工试制自动化玻璃引上机成功，现正装箱运往秦皇岛试车。
    玻璃引上机是制造各种平板玻璃不可缺少的一种重要机器，过去我国从未制造过。该厂制造的这部玻璃引上机，可以制造平板玻璃（厚度从二公厘到六公厘，宽度达二点三公尺，长度随需要而定），每小时平均产量可达到一百平方公尺。在试制中，职工们想出各种办法，克服了技术和设备方面的困难。综合车间王思武小组用元车代替搪床，解决了齿轮箱等加工的困难；技术员孙海月和工人杜劳共同研究，找出了十四对石棉滚子的中心点，保证了机体的平行垂直，胜利完成了装配任务。五月五日，该厂举行了玻璃引上机制造成功的庆祝大会。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使馆商务随员李允华也参加了庆祝会。
    适合放映电影用的汽油机
    广西省地方国营柳州机械厂职工，按照民主德国所制的汽油机的样机，制造了一种四马力汽油机，并于今年四月份开始大量生产。这种小型的动力机械，重二十公斤，附上配电设备，便成为一·五千伏安的轻便汽油发电机。它适合于农村流动放映队放映电影用，也可以用来照明、带动水泵和空气压缩机。现在，中央文化部电影事业局已向该厂订购了大批的机器。
    “一三二五”型苏式六角机床
    我国第一台“一三二五”型苏式六角机床，已在国营南京机床厂制造成功。
    这台机床可以装置十二把不同的刀具进行切削，而一般机床只能装到四把；它的车头转速也超过了一般机床，每分钟能打到一千三百多转；在机床上还装有安全装置，可以减少事故，这更是普通机床所没有的。
    “一三二五”型机床的制造成功，是南京机床厂适应国家工业建设需要进行多品种生产中的第一个捷报。当这种机床尚在制造时，已有广州汽轮机厂、上海电焊机厂、哈尔滨电机厂等十个单位向他们预先订了货。
    高压耐酸鼓风机
    上海公私合营天原天利电化厂，试造高压耐酸鼓风机成功。
    高压耐酸鼓风机是化学工业中不可缺少的机器。它比一般的鼓风机能耐蚀。过去我国的化工厂中所用的高压鼓风机，全部是由国外买来的。
    自制的高压耐酸鼓风机，每分钟的打风量比美国制的提高了三分之一，风压也较美国制的加大了近一倍。因此，产量既高，成本又低。在一九五○年时买一部美国制六寸低压鼓风机需九千万元（比高压的便宜），而我国自制的高压耐酸鼓风机，成本不过三千多万元。
    制造青霉素用的对流离心提炼机
    国营上海第三制药厂自行设计的制造青霉素
  （配尼西林）用的对流离心提炼机，已试制成功，将于五月份内正式投入生产。
    该厂过去是用碟式提炼机来提炼青霉素的，因效率较差，一般只能达到百分之七十左右的回收率。现在制成的对流提炼机，能把原液中的青霉素充分提炼出来，根据试验的结果，回收率至少可达到百分之八十五以上，而且所耗用的溶媒剂也比过去显著减少。按照该厂扩建后的产量计算，采用这种提炼机，在不增加原料的情况下，每年可多生产供给七百多万病人使用的青霉素，还可节省溶媒剂四万多加仑，共计节约成本达三百多亿元。更重要的是，这种机械结构较简单，国内可以自行制造，不但在扩建时使国家节省了一批外汇，还替我国青霉素制造工业的发展创造了条件。
    风冷式水银蒸空泵
    沈阳市电车厂变电所过去使用的是水冷式水银蒸空泵，这种设备因使用年限过久，一发生故障，便要影响市内电车的运行。为了避免这种情况的发生，该厂副厂长潘宝岳和变电所老工人、工程师等人共同研究，在四月中旬试制了风冷式水银蒸空泵，经试验，效果良好。在试制过程中，职工们曾克服了材料和技术等方面的许多困难。
    选矿机
    衡阳矿山机械厂首次试制选矿机设备成功。这台选矿机包括不同种类（有二十多种）的机器六十多台；作业过程分为破碎、筛分、输送矿物等五个工序，完全代替了人工选矿。该厂去年九月接受制造选矿机设备的任务后，为了保证质量，曾五次修改图纸。职工们在今年四月份一个月中，围绕关键问题，提出了二十二个合理化建议。在制造过程中，大家运用苏联先进经验，解决了技术上很多困难问题。
    四月二十四日该厂举行了试车典礼，机器运转情况很好。这套选矿机只要十二人操作，就代替了一千一百人的工作。回收率也由手工的百分之五十，提高到百分之八十五到九十五。
      六点三吨电池机车
    旅大交通公司电车工厂为鞍山钢铁公司试制六点三吨电池机车成功。
    六点三吨电池机车是拉矿石用的，每小时能行驶五公里，牵引力一万零八十公斤，牵引重量四十吨。
    这种机车部件很复杂，仅机体的零件就有四、五百种，图纸有三百多张。在试制过程中，他们克服了不少困难。如技术员徐蕴在设计电池机车图纸的时候，碰到了特性曲线和牵引量无法计算的困难。他就参考有关苏联矿坑机车试造的资料，解决了这一困难。在测绘电池机车时，工程师们解决了没有平台工具的困难，比计划提前一天半完成了电池机车的外部测绘工作。
      钢拱架
    一种对我国铁路新线桥梁工程和对节约钢材都有重大意义的新产品—钢拱架，已在铁道部山海关桥梁工厂试制成功，并已开始成批生产。
    钢拱架是一种建筑石拱桥时使用的钢架。过去，铁路新线通常都是使用钢铁结构的桥梁，这种钢结构的桥梁需要用成百成千吨钢材。而使用钢拱架来建筑铁路石拱桥，就能充分利用新线工地附近的山石；同时，这种钢拱架像一般基本建设工程所用的模型板一样，当石拱桥灌浆凝固筑成以后，还可把它拆除用到另一孔桥梁上。并且，由于它本身的高度准确，又能充分保证桥梁的质量。
    现在，山海关桥梁工厂职工制成的第一批三百三十吨钢拱架已经运出，供给中央人民政府铁道部第二工程局新线桥梁施工时应用。该厂并已接受其他新线工程局的订货，正继续成批生产中。
