Xinhua News Agency, Geneva: The speech by Zhou Enlai, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China and Foreign Minister, at the conference on the 28th has aroused great interest among journalists from various countries covering the conference, especially those from Asian countries. Many reporters from countries such as India and Burma believe that the proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the issue of Asian peace are fully in line with the wishes of their people and the people of other Asian countries for peace and security.

Today, newspapers in Geneva and throughout Switzerland have published summaries of Foreign Minister Zhou's speech.

The "Vorwaerts" published in Basel published Foreign Minister Zhou's speech under the title "The Independent Rights of the Peoples of Asian Countries." The "Tribune de Genève" published Foreign Minister Zhou's speech in great detail. In a commentary entitled "The Rights of the People of All Countries Should Be Handled by Themselves," the newspaper wrote: "Zhou Enlai's speech at the Palais des Nations is of great importance. It represents China's general attitude on international issues. This is exactly what he put forward in noble and very clear words, and at the same time, his speech also showed a generous spirit of consultation and firmness of principle."

Xinhua News Agency: According to the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, April 29: Polish newspapers' reporters in Geneva commented on the speeches of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and Dulles, Secretary of State of the United States, at the Geneva Conference.

Eda Werfel, a reporter for "Życie Warszawy," said that Zhou Enlai's speech and Dulles' speech reflected two opposite attitudes—the attitude of Asian countries fighting for independence and the attitude of imperialist colonizers.

He said: The suggestion about the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea annoyed Dulles the most. Dulles believes that true freedom can only exist under the occupation of foreign troops. This is of course contrary to common sense, but it does not violate Dulles' true intentions—to maintain a Korean colonial regime backed by foreign bayonets.

He said: Dulles believes that he cares about the "free world," and we believe that he cares about colonial rule and other intentions. These intentions were exposed when Dulles said that Korea is a peninsula of strategic value and has therefore been the object of the policies of major powers for many years.

Eda Werfel talked about Zhou Enlai's speech and said: "This is the speech of a representative of free Asia." "He calmly said: The historical trend is irresistible. No force in the world can stop the Chinese people from taking their own path. The People's China respects the people of other countries, respects their way of life, and respects their right to choose their own national system, but it also requires other countries to treat it with the same attitude." "What he said about his own country also applies to other Asian countries. The conference should bring peace to these countries, but not at the cost of sacrificing their independence."

Zygmunt Broniarek wrote in "Trybuna Ludu": Dulles spoke on behalf of a group that is willing to oppose the cause of peace at all costs and re-enslave Asian countries in the name of "freedom" and "democracy."

Dulles continues to ignore reality. He does not want to admit the fact that times have changed and the era of colonialism is gone forever. Those Asian countries that are now deciding their own future are saying to all kinds of colonizers: "Gentlemen, your gamble is doomed to lose."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd: The Czechoslovak "Rudé Právo", the Hungarian "Szabad Nép" and the Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" published in full the speech of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, at the Geneva Conference on April 28th, on April 30th.

### 各国舆论重视周外长的发言  认为周外长提出的有关亚洲和平问题的主张符合各国人民的愿望

    各国舆论重视周外长的发言
    认为周外长提出的有关亚洲和平问题的主张符合各国人民的愿望
    【新华社日内瓦讯】中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来外长在二十八日会议上的发言，引起了来自各国采访会议新闻的记者们特别是来自亚洲各国的记者们的巨大兴趣。印度、缅甸等国的许多记者都认为，周恩来外长提出的有关亚洲和平问题的主张，是完全符合他们的和亚洲其他各国的人民要求和平与安全的愿望的。
    今日此间及瑞士各地报纸都刊登了周外长发言的摘要。
    在巴塞尔出版的“前进报”在“亚洲各国人民的独立权利”的标题下刊登了周外长的发言。日内瓦“工人之声报”以很大篇幅刊登周外长的发言，该报在一篇以“各国人民的权利应由他们自己来处理”为题的评论中写道：“周恩来在国联大厦的演说具有非常的重要性。它表现了中国在国际问题上的总的态度。这正是他在高尚和十分明确的言辞中所提出的东西，同时他的演说也表现了宽大的协商精神和原则的坚定性”。
    【新华社讯】据波兰通讯社华沙四月二十九日讯：波兰各报驻日内瓦记者评论中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来和美国国务卿杜勒斯在日内瓦会议上的发言。
   “华沙生活报”记者埃达·维尔费尔说，周恩来的发言和杜勒斯的发言，反映了两种相反的态度——为独立而斗争的亚洲国家的态度和帝国主义殖民者的态度。
    他说：关于外国军队撤离朝鲜的建议，最使杜勒斯恼怒。杜勒斯认为真正的自由只有在外国军队的占领下才能存在。这当然是违反常理的，但是却不违反杜勒斯的真正意图——保持以外国刺刀为后盾的朝鲜殖民政权。
    他说：杜勒斯认为他关心的是“自由世界”，我们认为他关心的是殖民政权和另外一些意图。当杜勒斯说朝鲜是一个具有战略价值的半岛因而许多年来一直是大国的政策对象的时候，这种意图便暴露了。
    埃达·维尔费尔谈到周恩来的发言说：“这是自由亚洲的代表的发言。”“他沉着地说：历史潮流是不可抗拒的。世界上没有任何一种力量能够阻挠中国人民走自己的道路。人民中国尊重他国人民，尊重他们的生活方式，并尊重他们选择自己国家制度的权利，但是它也要求其他国家以同等的态度对待它。”“他所谈到的关于他自己的国家的话，也同样适用于其他亚洲国家。会议应该给这些国家带来和平，但是不能以牺牲它们的独立的代价来取得和平。”
    泽格蒙特·布朗尼亚雪克在“人民论坛报”上写道：杜勒斯是代表这样一个集团发言的，这个集团愿意不顾一切地反对和平事业，并用“自由”和“民主”的名义来重新束缚亚洲国家。
    杜勒斯继续无视现实。他不想承认事实：时代已经改变，殖民主义时代已经永不复还了。那些现在在决定自己前途的亚洲国家，对着形形色色的殖民者说：“先生们，你们的赌博注定要输的。”
   【新华社布拉格二日电】捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”、匈牙利“自由人民报”与保加利亚“工人事业报”四月三十日全文刊载了中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来四月二十八日在日内瓦会议上的发言。
