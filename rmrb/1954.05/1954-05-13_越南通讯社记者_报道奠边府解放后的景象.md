Xinhua News Agency, May 12th: A Vietnam News Agency reporter reported on the scene after the liberation of Dien Bien Phu, saying: After several months of fighting, at 10 PM on May 7th, the sound of gunfire was heard for the first time in months in the mountains and rice fields of Dien Bien Phu. That very night, soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army visited Dien Bien Phu residents who had previously been detained by the enemy and gave full care to the more than two thousand people who had been forcibly brought from the Red River Delta to Dien Bien Phu to do hard labor. Representatives of the Vietnam People's Army visited wounded prisoners of war of the enemy and explained to them the lenient policy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards prisoners of war. Soldiers of the People's Army were also busy taking in wounded and surrendered enemy personnel, and arranging accommodation and food for them.

On the morning of May 8th, although the Plain of Muong Thanh was still full of traces of war damage caused by the invaders, it was filled with an extremely warm atmosphere under the summer sun. The people joyfully welcomed the victorious army.

The Plain of Muong Thanh was covered with golden-starred red flags, marking this historic victory, marking the complete liberation of Northwest Vietnam and the day the French invaders and American interventionists suffered a crushing defeat.

    报道奠边府解放后的景象
   【新华社十二日讯】越南通讯社记者报道奠边府解放后的景象说：经过几个月的战斗后，到五月七日下午十时，奠边府的山地和稻田上第一次听不见炮火的声音。就在这一天晚上，越南人民军战士们去探望以前被敌人拘留起来的奠边府居民，对于被敌人从红河三角洲地区强迫拉到奠边府做苦工的两千多人民，给予充分的照顾。越南人民军的代表访问了敌军受伤的战俘，向他们解释了越南民主共和国政府对待战俘的宽大政策。人民军的战士也忙着收容受伤和投降的敌军人员，并为他们安排住处和饮食。
    五月八日清晨，芒清平原上虽然还到处是侵略者所造成的战争破坏的痕迹，但在夏天的阳光下洋溢着极为热烈的气氛。人民兴高采烈地欢迎胜利的军队。
    芒清平原上到处飘扬着金星红旗，标志着这次历史性的胜利，标志着越南西北地区完全解放和使法国侵略军和美国干涉者遭受惨败的日子。
