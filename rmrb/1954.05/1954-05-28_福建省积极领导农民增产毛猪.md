Fujian Province Actively Leads Farmers to Increase Hog Production

Fujian Province farmers plan to raise more than 2.77 million hogs this year, an increase of more than 210,000 over last year. After the annual hog raising plan is realized, the total amount of pork produced in the province will reach more than 200 million jin, and the income of pig farmers will reach more than one trillion yuan. If the manure from these hogs is fully collected, it can also provide sufficient fertilizer for 3 million mu of farmland.

This year, Party and government organs at all levels in Fujian Province have strengthened their leadership in hog production, and have deployed work to develop hog production through various meetings. The Longyan Prefectural Committee instructed its subordinate counties to lead hog production as an important task of agricultural production, and strive to achieve "every household raises pigs." Nan'jing, Changle, Shaowu, Yong'an, Fu'an and other places widely publicized the benefits of raising pigs, mobilized farmers to raise more hogs, and formulated plans for developing hog production. Party and government organs at all levels have actively tried to solve the feed problem in the development of hog production. The Nanping and Longxi Prefectural Grain Bureaus and the Changting and other county grain bureaus have strengthened the work of bran processing and supplied a large amount of bran to support farmers in raising pigs. Haicheng County supplies more than 10,000 jin of bran every day, which has initially met the needs of farmers for pig feed. Relevant leaders in Yunxiao, Longyan, Minhou and other places also held pig raising symposiums to summarize the experience of the masses in raising pigs with substitutes, vigorously promote them, and mobilize the masses to use idle land, wasteland, fieldsides, and corners of houses to plant miscellaneous grains to solve the problem of pig feed.

Banks and credit cooperatives in various places are also actively supporting farmers to raise more hogs. The work of disease prevention and control of hogs has also been strengthened. Guanghaicheng, Minqing and other three counties have trained nearly 100 animal husbandry personnel and organized veterinarians to go to the countryside to help the masses treat sick pigs. Xianyou County established two joint veterinary clinics and organized veterinarians to go to the countryside to treat diseases of hogs and other livestock. According to statistics, more than 2,000 sick pigs have been cured this spring.

At present, the enthusiasm of farmers in various parts of the province to raise pigs has greatly increased, and the number of hogs is increasing day by day. After the farmers in Longshan Township, Shaowu, understood the benefits of raising more pigs, the number of hogs in the township increased by dozens. Jiang Xiaosi, a farmer who had not raised pigs for 40 years, recently also raised hogs. The number of hogs in Guanling Town, Qili District, Lianjiang, has doubled compared with last year.

    福建省积极领导农民增产毛猪
    福建省农民今年计划饲养的毛猪二百七十七万多只，比去年增加二十一万多只。全年饲养毛猪计划实现后，将使该省出产猪肉的总量达到二亿多斤，养猪农民收入将达一万多亿元。如果充分积聚这些毛猪的粪便，还可使三百万亩农田获得足够的肥料。
    福建省各级党政机关今年都加强了对毛猪生产的领导，并通过各种会议部署发展毛猪生产工作。龙岩地委指示所属各县，把毛猪生产作为农业生产一项重要工作来领导，争取做到“户户养猪”。南靖、长乐、邵武、永安、福安等地广泛宣传养猪的好处，动员农民多养毛猪，并制订了发展毛猪生产计划。各地党政机关都积极设法解决发展毛猪生产中的饲料问题。南平、龙溪专署粮食局和长汀等县粮食局加强谷糠加工工作，大量供应谷糠，支持农民养猪。海澄县每日供应谷糠达一万多斤，初步满足了农民对猪饲料的需要。云霄、龙岩、闽侯等地有关领导方面还专门召开养猪座谈会，总结群众用代食品养猪的经验，大力进行推广，并发动群众利用闲地、荒地、田边、屋角等地方种植杂粮，以解决猪食问题。
    各地的银行和信用合作组织也正在积极扶持农民多养毛猪。毛猪疾病防治工作也已加强，光海澄、闽清等三个县就训练了畜牧人员和组织兽医近百人，下乡帮助群众治疗病猪。仙游县成立了两个兽医联合诊所，并组织兽医下乡，治疗毛猪等牲畜疾病，据统计今春治好病猪达两千多只。
    目前该省各地农民养猪积极性大大提高，毛猪数量日益增加。邵武龙山乡农民懂得多养猪的好处后，全乡的毛猪增加了数十只，四十年来没有养过猪的农民江孝思，最近也养了毛猪。连江七区官岭镇毛猪数量比去年增加了一倍。
