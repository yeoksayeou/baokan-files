    Seeds of Friendship
    Yin Hanqing
    In March, in Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," it is the season of spring warmth and blooming flowers for sowing. Li Youlian, mother of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Special Class Merit Recipient and "Second Class Model of Cherishing the People" martyr Lü Yujiu, took out the more than ten ears of rice, millet, and sorghum that she had carefully preserved in her box for a long time, and began the work of threshing, preparing to sow them herself. When she saw these seeds, she felt warmth in her heart, a smile appeared on her face, and she couldn't help but say, "These seeds were really hard-earned!"
    It was on April 21st of last year. That morning, enemy planes frantically attacked the Kim Il-sung mountains on the east coast of Korea, causing mountain fires that spread everywhere. Soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stationed nearby and local Korean people risked their lives to put out the fire. Among them, Lü Yujiu, Li Youlian's son, and his close comrade-in-arms Zhang Minglu, selflessly rescued eight Korean women from the raging fire.
    Although the martyr sacrificed himself, the spirit of the martyr lives on. Soon, the "Lü Yujiu and Zhang Minglu Production Shock Brigade" was established, with Labor Party member Li Zhenshu (translated previously as Li Zhengshu), who was rescued by the martyr, as the captain, and absorbing young people from the whole village to participate. As soon as the shock brigade was established, it engaged in arduous struggles against various difficulties in production. When there was a shortage of labor and livestock, they used the method of exchanging labor to solve the problem. During the day, enemy planes bombed and strafed wildly, so they plowed the fields and transplanted rice seedlings at night. They also used their own hands and simple tools to reclaim wasteland and build dams to expand production. A huge dam was built, and 1,300 pyeong of wasteland was transformed into fertile land. Last autumn, they harvested a bumper crop from more than 39,000 pyeong of paddy and dry land, with a yield increase of 80% compared to 1952, and the number of shock brigade members also increased to 103. Marshal Kim Il-sung also wrote them a letter of commendation, encouraging them to continue their efforts, further study the great spirit of martyrs Lü Yujiu and Zhang Minglu, and increase grain production for the republic.
    The bumper harvest made the shock brigade members miss the parents of the martyrs even more. On December 25th of last year, at the unveiling ceremony of the martyrs' monument, Li Zhenshu and others handed over more than ten ears of rice, millet, and sorghum that they had grown themselves to the representatives of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, entrusting them to give them to the martyrs' parents in China. Among the gifts were also embroidered banners and letters of condolence handwritten by eight women, Korean specialty precious ginseng, and platinum rings they had preserved from the war years. Each gift contained the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Because the comrades of the delegation could not return to their country immediately, they transferred these gifts to the unit where the martyr had served.
    On February 18th of this year, comrades Wu Wenjin and others, representatives of the unit, came to the hometown of martyr Lü Yujiu—Ronglong Township, Rongchang County, Sichuan Province. At the condolence and gift-giving meeting, Mother Lü personally received these precious gifts from Korea. She gazed at them for a long time, moved by the deep friendship between the two peoples. After the meeting, she put the seeds in a small box like treasures and saved them, preparing to sow them herself in the future. She also wrote a letter to Li Zhenshu and the other eight Korean women: "I especially cherish the agricultural products you grew with your own hands, grown from the Korean soil. I want to plant them myself on the land of New China, so that they can take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit. In the future, when I see these crops, it will be like seeing you, seeing the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people growing and consolidating..."
    Now, Mother Lü is carefully threshing the seeds. The sorghum grains are not easy to rub off, so she picks them off one by one by hand; if a few grains of millet slip through her fingers, she picks them up again one by one. She cherishes every seed from Korea, because it embodies the flesh-and-blood friendship between the two peoples. After threshing, she begins to carefully select the seeds, then soaks them in a small jar, preparing to adopt the advanced experience of the Rongchang County State-owned Farm and sow them the next day.
    In the evening, Mother Lü also specifically convened a meeting of the joint mutual aid group members to discuss the sowing matters for the next day. When the group members heard that they were going to sow the seeds sent by the Korean people tomorrow, they were very excited, believing that it was a great honor to be able to help Mother Lü plant these seeds. At the meeting, everyone also decided to plant these seeds on the fertile land in front of Mother Lü's door, so that the seeds could grow vigorously, and Mother Lü could see the growth of the crops with her own eyes. The group members also stated: Mother Lü often has things to do outside, and we guarantee to cultivate the crops well and strive for a bumper harvest.
    Early the next morning, the intense labor began. Mother Lü personally scattered the seeds, watching the distribution of the seeds, fearing that the seeds would not be scattered evenly. Some group members sprinkled manure, some covered the soil, and soon the sorghum and millet were planted. Finally, Mother Lü, following the advanced experience of "sparse sowing of rice seeds," scattered the rice seeds into the pre-cultivated seedling fields, then stood on the ridge of the field and looked around, smiling with satisfaction. She began to plan: the seedlings must be cultivated to be thick and strong, transplanted in a timely manner, and the advanced experience of "sparse seedlings, dense planting, and rational fertilization" must be adopted during transplantation. The crops must be weeded one more time than other crops, and fertilized twice more. In short, she wanted to make these seeds of friendship take solid roots in her own land, sprout strong buds, bloom bright flowers, and bear abundant fruits! Let these seeds become a symbol of the continuous development and consolidation of the flesh-and-blood friendship between China and Korea.
    At this time, a few silver-gray clouds floated in the eastern sky, and Mother Lü looked northeastward along the clouds, lost in thought. She thought that the countryside of the motherland was full of flowers and green grass everywhere, and the grass on Yujiu's grave should also be green! She also thought that Li Zhenshu and the others might be sowing on the Korean land again at this time, hoping that their production difficulties this year would be less than in the past, and that they would harvest more grain this year than last year. This 50-year-old Mother Lü cherished everything in Korea with a motherly heart! (Attached picture)

    友谊的种子
    尹汉卿
    三月，在“天府之国”的四川，正是春暖花开的播种季节。中国人民志愿军特等功臣、“二级爱民模范”吕玉久烈士的母亲李友莲，把自己细心保存了很久的十多穗水稻、谷子和高粱从箱子里取出来，进行脱粒工作，准备亲手下种。她一看到这些种子，心里就感到暖烘烘的，脸上就露出微笑，不由得说了一声：“这些种子来得可真不容易啊！”
    那还是去年四月二十一日的事情。那天上午，敌机狂袭朝鲜东海岸的金刚山，山林起火，遍地漫延。驻在附近的中国人民志愿军某部战士和当地朝鲜人民一起奋不顾身地去救火。其中李友莲的儿子吕玉久和他的亲密战友张明禄，舍身从烈火中抢救出来了八个朝鲜妇女。
    烈士虽然牺牲了，可是烈士的精神却活着。很快，“吕玉久、张明禄生产突击队”成立了，突击队以被烈士所抢救的劳动党员李贞淑（按前译为李郑淑）为队长，吸收全里的青年参加。突击队一成立，就和生产上的各种困难进行了艰苦的斗争。劳动力不足，牲口缺乏，就用换工的办法来解决。白天有敌人的飞机狂轰滥炸，他们就在晚上犁田插秧。他们还用自己的双手和简单的工具开荒修坝，扩大生产。一条巨大的水坝修起来了，一千三百坪荒地也变成了良田。去年秋季，他们耕种的三万九千多坪水、旱田获得了丰收，产量比一九五二年提高了百分之八十，突击队员也增加到一百零三人。金日成元帅还给他们写了一封嘉勉信，勉励他们继续努力，进一步学习吕玉久、张明禄烈士的伟大精神，为共和国增产粮食。
    丰收，使突击队员们更想望烈士的父母亲了。去年十二月二十五日，在烈士的墓碑揭幕典礼大会上，李贞淑等把自己亲手种植的十多穗水稻、谷子和高粱，交给中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的代表，托他们转赠给远在中国的烈士的父母亲。礼品中还有八位妇女亲手绣制的锦旗和写的慰问信，朝鲜的特产名贵的高丽参，以及她们在战争时期所保留下来的白金戒子。每一件礼品中都蕴藏着中朝人民的深厚友谊。慰问团的同志因为不能立即返国，又把这些礼品转给烈士生前所在的部队里。
    今年二月十八日，部队代表武文进等同志来到了烈士吕玉久的家乡——四川省荣昌县荣隆乡。在慰问献礼大会上，吕妈妈亲手接过来这些来自朝鲜的珍贵礼品。她久久地凝视着，她被两国人民的这种深厚友谊所感动了。会后，她把那些种子当做宝贝似地放到小箱子里保存起来，准备将来亲手播种。她又给李贞淑等八位朝鲜妇女写了这样一封信：“我特别珍爱你们亲手种植的、从朝鲜土地上生长起来的农产品，我要亲手把它种在新中国的土地上，让它生根发芽，开花结果。将来我看到这些庄稼，就像看见了你们，看见了中朝两国人民的友谊日益发展和巩固。……”
    现在，吕妈妈细心地进行脱粒工作。高粱的粒子不容易搓下来，她就用手一颗颗地摘；几颗谷粒从手指缝里溜下去，她就一粒粒地再拾起来。她，珍惜来自朝鲜的每一颗种子。因为它凝结着两国人民血肉般的友谊。脱粒之后，她就开始精选种子，然后把它用小缸子泡起来，准备采用荣昌县国营农场的先进经验，于第二天下种。
    晚上，吕妈妈还特意召集了联组互助组的组员开会，商讨明天下种的事情。组员们一听说明天就要播种朝鲜人民送来的种子，都非常兴奋，认为能帮助吕妈妈种下这些种子是莫大的光荣。会上，大家还确定要把这些种子下在吕妈妈门口那块肥沃的土地上，这样，种子既能茁壮地生长，吕妈妈又可亲眼看到庄稼的成长。组员们还表示：吕妈妈常有事到外面去，我们保证把庄稼栽培好，争取丰收。
    第二天一早，紧张的劳动就开始了。吕妈妈亲手撒着种子，两眼注视着它的分布情况，生怕种子撒得不匀。组员们有的淋粪，有的盖土，很快就把高粱和谷子种好了。最后，吕妈妈又按照“稀撒稻种”的先进经验，把稻种撒到事先耕耘好的秧田里，然后站在田埂上四下看了看，满意地笑了。她在开始盘算着：要把秧苗培育得又粗又壮，适时移植，移植时要采用“少秧密栽，合理施肥”的先进经验，比其他庄稼多薅一次，还要多追两次肥。总之，要使这些友谊的种子，在自己的土地上生下结实的根，发出茁壮的芽，开出灿烂的花，结成丰硕的果！让这些种子成为中朝血肉友谊不断发展和巩固的象征。
    这时，东方的上空浮现着几片银灰色的云朵，吕妈妈顺着云朵遥望着东北方，陷入沉思中。她想祖国的农村到处都是花红草绿了，玉久坟头上的草也该绿了吧！她又想，这时李贞淑她们也许又在朝鲜的土地上播种了，但愿她们今年生产上的困难比过去少些，今年打的粮食比去年多些。这位已经五十岁的吕妈妈，以慈母般的心情怀念着朝鲜的一切！（附图片）
