    The Lenin Communist Youth League Gives Us a License
    By Pyotr Savelyev, Tractor Driver, Volunteer Land Reclamation Youth League Member, and Hua Pilfilova, of the Novo-Yelovsky Machine Tractor Station, Altai Krai, USSR
    The Communist Party and the Soviet government have put forward the grand task of drastically increasing the production of daily necessities in our country. In fulfilling this task, further developing grain economy, which is the foundation of all agricultural production, is of particular significance.
    The Party and the government have pointed out such enormous potential: utilizing this potential can rapidly expand grain production and enable the Soviet people to obtain abundant products of all kinds at an early date. This potential lies in the millions of hectares of virgin and long-fallow land in our country's southeast that have never been cultivated.
    Our powerful socialist industry is supplying first-class machines to reclaim these lands and harvest more than one billion poods of grain from them. This requires brave, resolute people who are not afraid of difficulties. The Soviet state has many such people. Tens of thousands of patriots have expressed their willingness to work in areas reclaiming new land.
    The initiator of this patriotic movement is the Lenin Communist Youth League. Thousands of young men and women, following the example of their predecessors, older brothers and sisters who built dozens of cities, large factories, and power stations in deserts and vast forests, are determined to participate in the arduous task of reclaiming virgin and long-fallow land.
    We, the young workers of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, were among the first to apply to participate in land reclamation. On February 22nd, we were invited to the Kremlin. The leaders of the Party and the government warmly welcomed us in the Kremlin Hall. We listened to the parting words of Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party. The Youth League members pledged to do their best to gloriously repay the people's trust.
    A few days later, we arrived in Altai, nearly four thousand kilometers from Moscow. Altai is the largest and richest region of our vast motherland. It is rightly called the Siberian pearl and pride of the collective farms. This region is rich in excellent spring wheat, has a large-scale oil industry, and livestock breeding of fine-wool sheep. The region's natural resources provide endless potential for further and more vigorous agricultural development.
    We Muscovites immediately fell in love with Altai's ocean-like vast grasslands. From the very beginning, the newly arrived Youth League members and local residents established close and sincere friendships. In the collective farms of Altai, there are many famous experts in socialist agriculture. Socialist Labor Heroes Comrade Yefremov, Comrade Shcherbinin, and others have obtained unprecedented spring wheat harvests on virgin land—360 to 470 poods per hectare. The region's machine tractor stations have many outstanding machine operators. The Moscow Youth League members enthusiastically studied the experience of Pyatnitsky, captain of the tractor brigade of the Budyonny Machine Tractor Station, combine harvester operator, and Socialist Labor Hero. In his seventeen years of operating combine harvesters, he has harvested 46,000 hectares of grain crops and threshed a total of 1,500 carriages of grain. If converted into kilometers, the distance traveled by his combine harvester would have circled the equator more than once.
    The Youth League members who volunteered to participate in land reclamation are tirelessly learning from the experience of local farmers. Our group, formerly workers of the Stalin Automobile Factory, decided to work at the Novo-Yelovsky Machine Tractor Station in the Trotsky District. This district will reclaim 22,000 hectares of new land this spring. We have already graduated from short-term agricultural technology training courses. We will be operating our country's newly produced powerful diesel tractors. Now our work team is in the fields; as soon as the snow melts, we will begin reclaiming virgin land. The Youth League members have pledged to complete no less than 150 percent of the task per shift.
    More than 15,000 young volunteers, with the permission of the Lenin Communist Youth League, have come to Altai from all over the country. They are determined not to let down the trust of the Soviet people. The patriotic volunteers and the farmers of Altai, working closely together, will reclaim approximately 2.5 million hectares of new land in the region's grasslands. Our dear motherland will thereby obtain millions of poods of the best wheat.

    列宁共产主义青年团给我们的许可证
    苏联阿尔泰边疆区新叶洛夫机器拖拉机站　彼·萨维里耶夫  拖拉机手、志愿垦荒的青年团员　华·彼尔菲洛娃
    共产党和苏联政府提出了急剧提高我国日用品生产的宏伟任务。在完成这一任务时，进一步发展作为全部农业生产基础的谷物经济，具有特殊重要的意义。
    党和政府指出了这样的巨大潜力：利用这一潜力就能迅速扩大谷物生产，并能使苏联人民早日获得丰富的各种产品。这一潜力就是我国东南部千百万公顷从未翻耕过的生荒地和许久未曾翻耕的熟荒地。
    我国强大的社会主义工业供应着头等机器来开垦这些土地并从这些土地上收获十亿普特以上的谷物。这需要勇敢的、坚决的不怕困难的人。苏维埃国家有很多这样的人。成千上万的爱国者表示愿意到开垦新地的地区去工作。
    这一爱国主义运动的发起者是列宁共产主义青年团。数以千计的青年男女，仿效那些曾在沙漠和大森林地带建起了几十个城市、大工厂和发电站的先辈、哥哥和姐姐的范例，决心参加开垦生荒地和熟荒地的艰巨事业。
    我们莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的青年工人，是第一批申请参加垦荒的。二月二十二日我们曾被邀赴克里姆林宫。党和政府的领导者在克里姆林宫大厅热情地欢送我们。我们听取了党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志的临别赠言。青年团员们提出保证，要尽全力光荣地回答人民的信任。
    几天以后，我们已到了距莫斯科几达四千公里的阿尔泰。阿尔泰是我们辽阔的祖国最巨大最富庶的边疆区。人们称它为集体农庄的西伯利亚的珍珠和骄傲是有道理的。这个边疆区盛产优等的春小麦，有规模宏大的制油业和繁殖细毛绵羊的畜牧业。边疆区的天然富源为进一步、更加有力地发展农业提供了无尽的潜能。
    我们莫斯科人立即爱上了阿尔泰这海洋般辽阔的草原。新到来的青年团员和当地居民，从最初几天开始就建立了紧密的真挚的友情。阿尔泰各集体农庄中，有许多社会主义农业的著名能手。社会主义劳动英雄叶菲列莫夫同志、谢尔比宁同志和其他同志在生荒地上得到了世界空前的春小麦收获量——每公顷三百六十至四百七十普特。边疆区的机器拖拉机站有许多优秀的机器操使者。莫斯科的青年团员们兴致勃勃地学习了布琼尼机器拖拉机站拖拉机工作队队长、联合收割机驾驶者、社会主义劳动英雄普雅特尼茨的经验。他在操使联合收割机的十七年之中，收割了四万六千公顷谷类作物，打的粮食共有一千五百车厢，如果折合成公里，那么他的联合收割机所行驶的里程已经绕过赤道一周多了。
    志愿参加垦荒的青年团员们，不屈不挠地学习着当地农民的经验。我们由过去斯大林汽车工厂工人组成的这一组，决定在特罗茨基区新叶洛夫机器拖拉机站工作。这一区今春将开垦二万二千公顷新地。我们已经在学习农业技术的短期训练班毕了业。我们将要操使我国新出产的强有力的柴油拖拉机。现在我们的工作队正在田野上；只要雪一融化，我们就开始开垦生荒地。青年团员们提出的保证是：每班完成的任务不低于百分之一百五十。
    有一万五千余名青年志愿开荒者，得到列宁共产主义青年团的许可，从全国各地来到了阿尔泰。他们决心不辜负苏联人民的托付。志愿开荒的爱国者们和阿尔泰农民紧密合作，将在边疆区的草原上开垦约二百五十万公顷新地。亲爱的祖国将由此获得数百万普特最好的小麦。
