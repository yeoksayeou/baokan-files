Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 3rd (TASS): As previously reported, in view of the Australian government's actions which do not conform to the basic requirements of international relations, and which created an atmosphere that not only made it impossible for the Soviet Embassy to conduct normal diplomatic activities but also threatened the personal safety of the embassy staff, the Soviet government has decided to recall the Soviet Ambassador to Australia and all personnel of the Soviet Embassy. At the same time, the Soviet government announced that the personnel of the Australian Embassy could no longer remain in Moscow.

Soviet Ambassador G.P. Zhigalov and the staff of the Soviet Embassy left Australia on April 29th to return home. After the Soviet Embassy staff left, at the request of the Soviet government, the property of the Soviet Embassy in Australia will be looked after by the Swedish Legation in Canberra.

At the request of the Soviet government, the personnel of the Australian Embassy in Moscow left the Soviet Union on April 30th.

    苏驻澳使馆人员回国
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：前已报道，鉴于澳大利亚政府的行动不符合于国际关系的基本要求，而且制造了一种气氛，这种气氛不仅使得苏联大使馆不可能进行正常的外交活动，而且威胁到大使馆人员的人身安全，苏联政府已经决定召回苏联驻澳大利亚大使及苏联大使馆的全体人员。同时，苏联政府宣布：澳大利亚大使馆的人员也不可能再在莫斯科停留。
    苏联大使盖湼拉洛夫和苏联大使馆的人员于四月二十九日离开澳大利亚回国。在苏联大使馆的人员离开以后，根据苏联政府的要求，苏联大使馆在澳大利亚境内的财产将由堪培拉的瑞典公使馆看管。
    根据苏联政府的要求，澳大利亚驻莫斯科大使馆的人员于四月三十日离开苏联。
