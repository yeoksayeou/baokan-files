    Farmers Across the Country Actively Plant Cotton
    Many Areas in the North Have Exceeded Planting Plans

    [By this newspaper] Farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country are actively planting cotton. To date, in the northern single-crop cotton areas, generally 60% to 70% has been sown, and it is expected to be basically completed around the 10th. In the southern double-crop fields and parts of the Northeast, intensive planting is underway, and it is expected to be completed after the 10th. Hebei Province had planted more than 10.4 million mu of cotton before Labor Day, reaching 65% of the total cotton planting task, and the remaining more than 5 million mu is being intensively planted. Spring cotton planting in the entire province of Shaanxi, the Yuncheng and Linfen special districts of Shanxi Province, and Henan Province has been completed. Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei and other places are also planting, and it can also be completed before the 10th. The southern part of Northeast China will be basically completed before the 5th.
    After publicity and mobilization, farmers in various places have expanded the cotton planting area. All special districts in Hebei Province can complete the cotton planting according to the national plan, and some counties have exceeded the plan. Yuncheng and Yuci special districts in Shanxi Province have overfulfilled the cotton planting plan. Farmers in the coastal reclamation areas of Jiangsu are preparing to plant cotton on the newly reclaimed land, and the province can exceed the original plan by one million mu. In the southern and northern Shaanxi and Guanzhong dryland cotton areas of Shaanxi Province, the area of cotton fields has been appropriately expanded. Other places, such as Hubei, Sichuan, and Northeast China, can also complete the cotton planting task in accordance with the national plan.
    This year, cotton sowing was appropriately advanced in various places. In Xiangfan Special District, Hubei Province, sowing began around Qingming Festival. The Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, Yuncheng of Shanxi Province, and Xinxiang of Henan Province also began drought-resistant sowing around April 10. Around April 15, major cotton areas across the country generally experienced rainfall, and after the 20th, southern Northeast China and the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River continued to experience rainfall, creating favorable conditions for timely cotton sowing and germination. After the rain, various places immediately led farmers to seize the opportunity to plant, forming a high tide of cotton planting. By April 23, Handan Special District in Hebei Province had planted more than 2 million mu of cotton.
    Agricultural producers' cooperatives played a leading role in expanding cotton fields and timely sowing. The cotton planting area of ​​sixty-three cooperatives in Yuci Special District, Shanxi Province, has expanded by about two times compared with the past. More than 700 agricultural cooperatives in Yuncheng Special District took the lead in launching sowing work among the broad masses of farmers.

    各地农民积极播种棉花
    北方很多地区已超额完成播种计划
    【本报讯】全国各产棉区农民积极播种棉花。到目前为止，北方一熟棉田地区一般已播完百分之六十到七十，十日前后基本上可以结束。南方两熟田和东北部分地区，正在全面抢种，预计在十日以后结束。河北省在“五一”节以前已种下棉花一千零四十多万亩，达种棉总任务的百分之六十五，其余五百多万亩正在继续抢种。陕西全省、山西省运城、临汾两专区和河南省的春田棉花都已播完。山东、江苏和湖北等地都正在播种，十日以前也可结束。东北南部地区在五日以前即可基本完成。
    各地农民经过宣传动员以后，纷纷扩大了种棉面积。河北省各专区都能按国家计划完成植棉，有些县还超过了计划。山西省运城、榆次等专区，超额完成了植棉计划。江苏沿海垦区农民，准备在新垦地上植棉，全省可超过原计划一百万亩。陕西省陕南、陕北和关中旱地棉区，都适当扩大了棉田的面积。其他如湖北、四川、东北等地，也都能按照国家计划完成植棉任务。
    今年，各地都适当地提早了棉花播种期。湖北省襄樊专区，在清明前后即开始播种。陕西省的关中地区、山西省的运城和河南省的新乡等地，也都在四月十日左右开始了抗旱播种。四月十五日前后全国各主要棉区普遍降雨，二十日以后，东北南部和淮河中、下游又继续降雨，给棉花适时播种和发芽出苗造成了有利条件。各地在雨后立即领导农民抢墒下种，形成了种棉高潮。河北省邯郸专区到四月二十三日止，就已种棉二百多万亩。
    各地在扩大棉田和适时播种中，农业生产合作社发挥了带头作用。山西省榆次专区的六十三个合作社，植棉面积约比过去扩大两倍。运城专区七百多个农业社，提前带动广大农民展开播种工作。
