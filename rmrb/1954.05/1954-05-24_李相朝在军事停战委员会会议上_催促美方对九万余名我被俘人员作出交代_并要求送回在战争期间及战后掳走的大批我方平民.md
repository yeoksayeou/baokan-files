Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 23rd. At the forty-third meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on May 22nd, our side's chief member, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, urged the U.S. side to provide a responsible and specific account of the list of 98,742 of our captured personnel who had been detained by the U.S. side, which our side had submitted eight months prior. He also demanded that the U.S. side fulfill the provisions of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement by returning the large number of our civilians who were abducted by the U.S. side during the war and are currently being forcibly detained by the U.S. side, as well as returning all of our civilians abducted from our rear islands after the armistice.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out: As early as September 21, 1953, our side, based on materials such as lists submitted by the U.S. side during the armistice negotiations or forwarded by the U.S. side through the International Committee of the Red Cross, presented a list of 98,742 of our captured personnel, demanding that the U.S. side provide a concrete account. All these captured personnel of our side had been detained by the U.S. side but were neither repatriated by the U.S. side nor were they on the list of deaths or escapes submitted by the U.S. side. Since our side submitted the above list, despite repeated inquiries from our side, the U.S. side has consistently failed to provide any explanation. It was not until May 13th of this year that the U.S. side fabricated some nonsense in an attempt to masquerade as an "account."

At the meeting, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao thoroughly exposed the absurdity of the U.S. side's so-called "account" by listing facts. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out: "The U.S. side claimed that over 21,000 people on the list of 98,742 of our captured personnel 'have been transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission,' attempting to use this as an 'account' for those over 21,000 people. However, it is universally known that due to the U.S. side dispatching special agents to infiltrate the prisoner-of-war camp in Tongchang-ri to threaten, persecute, and even kill prisoners of war, and to sabotage our explanation work in every possible way, the above-mentioned captured personnel never had the opportunity to request repatriation under the nominal custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. By January 20th and 21st of this year, the U.S. side even forcibly abducted these captured personnel of our side and handed them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. In this regard, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission repeatedly exposed this in its 'Interim Report' and 'Final Report' and clearly declared that this behavior of the U.S. side was completely illegal. Therefore, for these over 21,000 captured personnel of our side who were openly forcibly detained, it is absolutely not possible to settle the matter with an empty statement saying 'have been transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.' On May 13th, the U.S. side claimed: '26,936 prisoners of war listed on your list escaped before the signing of the armistice,' attempting to use this to 'account' for the approximately 27,000 captured personnel of our side who were openly abducted by the Syngman Rhee government under the instigation of the U.S. side in June 1953. But everyone remembers that this behavior of the U.S. side aroused strong condemnation from world public opinion, so that even the then U.S. Commander-in-Chief General Clark had to state in a letter to our Commander on June 29, 1953: 'The United Nations Command is continuing its efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war.' Now that the U.S. side has neither recovered these prisoners of war, it vainly attempts to use the three words 'escaped' to 'account' for them, which is absolutely not allowed. As for the other tens of thousands of our captured personnel, the U.S. side has even prevaricated with arguments such as errors and repeated or miscategorized entries in the list of our captured personnel it previously submitted to our side, and even openly claimed 'unable to identify.' All these lies using technical reasons as excuses are easily seen through."

After thoroughly exposing the U.S. side's so-called "account" of May 13th, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao denounced the U.S. side: The reason why the U.S. side has avoided discussing the list of 98,742 of our captured personnel submitted by our side for more than seven months, and has recently hastily pieced together a piece of nonsense to conduct a so-called "account" of this list from our side, is nothing more than to undermine the resolution of the issue of the U.S. side detaining and forcibly incorporating a large number of our captured personnel into the Li Chiang bandit army at the Geneva Conference. However, the desire of a large number of our captured personnel to return to their hometowns must be satisfied, and the U.S. side has an inescapable responsibility to provide a responsible and specific account of each of the 98,742 of our captured personnel submitted by our side.

At the meeting on May 22nd, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also raised the issue of the U.S. side forcibly abducting and forcibly detaining our civilians. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out: When the U.S. side retreated from our areas in the winter of 1950, it forcibly and with threats abducted our civilians, which the U.S. side itself claimed numbered over two million. So far, the U.S. side has only returned 37 of them. After the armistice, according to a plan predetermined by the U.S. side, it abducted a large number of our civilians from our rear coastal islands withdrawn by the U.S. side. Among the 45 rear islands of our side withdrawn by the U.S. side, the residents of 15 islands were all abducted by the U.S. side, and most of the residents of the other 30 islands were also abducted by the U.S. side. In this regard, our side has repeatedly protested to the U.S. side, but the U.S. side has not yet provided any explanation.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao solemnly pointed out at the meeting on the 22nd: The U.S. side's forced abduction of our civilians during the war has completely violated the provisions of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949. The U.S. side's continued forced abduction of a large number of civilians from our rear islands after the armistice also clearly violates the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the cessation of all hostile acts after the armistice. The U.S. side's current forced detention of our civilians seriously violates the provisions of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement regarding assistance to displaced civilians to return to their hometowns. As a party to the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. side has a full responsibility to return to our side the civilians of our side who were forcibly abducted by the U.S. side during the war and are currently being forcibly detained by the U.S. side in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement. The U.S. side also has a full responsibility to immediately return all of our civilians abducted from the forty-five rear islands of our side after the armistice took effect.

    李相朝在军事停战委员会会议上
    催促美方对九万余名我被俘人员作出交代
    并要求送回在战争期间及战后掳走的大批我方平民
    【新华社开城二十三日电】五月二十二日，军事停战委员会举行第四十三次会议。我方首席委员李相朝中将在会上催促美方对我方八个月以前提出的为美方拘留过的九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员的名单作出负责具体的交代，并提出美方应履行停战协定第五十九款的规定，送回在战争期间为美方掳走并正为美方强迫拘留的我方大批平民，以及全部送回在停战后自我方后方岛屿掳走的所有我方平民。
    李相朝中将指出：早在一九五三年九月二十一日，我方即根据美方在停战谈判中历次交来或美方经由红十字国际委员会转来的名单等材料提出九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员的名单，要美方切实加以交代。这些我方被俘人员全部为美方拘留过，但既未被美方遣返，也不在美方交来的死亡或逃亡的名单中。自我方提出上述名单后，虽经我方多次催问，美方却始终未作任何交代，直至今年五月十三日，美方才编造了一些鬼话企图冒充“交代”。
    李相朝中将在会上列举事实彻底揭露了美方此次所谓“交代”的荒谬性。李相朝中将指出：“美方声称在九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员名单上的二万一千多人‘已移交给中立国遣返委员会’，企图以此作为对那二万一千多人的‘交代’。但举世周知，由于美方派遣特务混入东场里战俘营威胁、迫害乃至于杀害战俘，并百般破坏我方解释工作，上述这些被俘人员在中立国遣返委员会名义上的看管下从未有过要求遣返的机会，至今年一月二十日和二十一日美方更以武力劫走了我方这些被俘人员，将他们押交蒋、李匪帮充当炮灰。对此，中立国遣返委员会曾在其‘临时报告’与‘最后报告’中一再予以揭发，并明白宣布美方此等行为是完全非法的。因此，对于这些被公然强迫扣留的二万一千多名我方被俘人员绝非一句‘已移交给中立国遣返委员会’的空话所能交代了事。美方在五月十三日声称：‘列于你们名单上的二万六千九百三十六名战俘在停战签字前逃跑了’，企图以此‘交代’在一九五三年六月为李承晚政府在美方怂恿下所公然劫走的二万七千名左右我方被俘人员。但谁都记得，美方这一行为曾引起世界舆论强烈的谴责，以致连当时的美方总司令克拉克将军都不得不在一九五三年六月二十九日致我方司令官的信中声明：‘联合国军正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘’，如今美方既未追回这些战俘，却妄想用‘逃跑了’三个字来‘交代’，这是绝不能允许的。至于其他数万名我方被俘人员，则美方竟以它过去所提交我方的我方被俘人员的名单错误重复及分类错误等说法来搪塞，甚至公然声称‘无法识别’，这种种以技术上的理由为托词的谎言也都是一识即破的。”
    李相朝中将在彻底揭穿美方五月十三日的所谓
  “交代”后指斥美方：美方所以在七个多月来对我方所提出的九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员的名单避而不谈，而最近却又匆忙地拼凑一篇鬼话来对我方这一名单进行所谓“交代”，无非是为了要破坏在日内瓦会议上解决美方扣留并强迫编入李蒋匪军的我方大批被俘人员的问题。但我方大批被俘人员返回家乡的愿望必须予以满足，美方有无可逃避的责任，对我方所提出的九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员中的每一个人作出负责与具体的交代。
    李相朝中将在五月二十二日会议上并提出美方强制掳走并强迫扣留我方平民的问题。李相朝中将指出：美方在一九五零年冬自我方地区败退时曾以武力与武力威胁掳走据美方自称数达二百万以上的我方平民，迄今为止美方仅送回其中的三十七名，在停战后又按照美方早就预定的计划，自美方所撤出的我方后方沿海岛屿掳走我方大批平民。在美方所撤出的四十五个我方后方岛屿中，有十五个岛屿的居民全部为美方掳走，而其他三十个岛屿的大部居民也为美方所掳走。对此，我方曾一再向美方提出抗议，但美方迄今尚未作任何交代。
    李相朝中将在二十二日会议上郑重指出：美方在战争中强制掳走我方平民已彻底破坏了一九四九年日内瓦战时保护平民公约第四十九条的规定，美方在停战后仍继续自我方后方岛屿强制掳走大量平民，也显然违反了停战协定中关于停战后应停止一切敌对行为的规定，美方目下强制扣留我方平民，又严重破坏了停战协定第五十九款关于协助失所平民返乡的规定。作为停战缔约的一方，美方有完全的责任按照停战协定的有关规定将在战争期间为美方所强制掳走的并正为美方强迫扣留的我方平民送回我方，美方也有完全的责任立即送回在停战生效之后自我方后方四十五个岛屿掳走的全部我方平民。
