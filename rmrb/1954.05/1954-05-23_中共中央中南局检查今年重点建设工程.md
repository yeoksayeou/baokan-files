    CCP Central Committee South Central Bureau Inspects Key Construction Projects This Year
    [Dispatch from Wuhan, May 22nd, this newspaper] In order to guarantee the completion of this year's construction tasks, the CCP Central Committee South Central Bureau recently formed an inspection team to conduct in-depth inspections of key projects in South Central China.
    In the first quarter of this year, the South Central region as a whole completed 17.25% of the annual plan for basic construction projects, generally falling short of the quarterly plan, especially with key projects lagging behind. The reasons for this were mainly inadequate preparation work for construction, and to varying degrees, complacency and slackening of effort existed among some leading departments. Therefore, the Urban Work Department of the South Central Bureau and the South Central Financial and Economic Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the South Central Bureau, together with the South Central professional bureaus, departments, and banks, formed a 90-person basic construction work inspection team to inspect key projects in South Central China over a period of one month. The inspection will focus on the implementation of planned management and regional management responsibility systems, as well as construction preparation work. The inspection team has now been divided into four groups and dispatched to Zhengzhou, Jiaozuo, Nanchang, Zhuzhou, and the Wuhan metallurgical area for inspection.

    中共中央中南局检查今年重点建设工程
    【本报武汉二十二日电】为了保证完成今年建设工程任务，中共中央中南局最近组成检查组，前往中南各重点工程，进行深入检查。
    今年第一季度，中南全区基本建设工程完成全年计划的百分之十七点二五，较普遍地没有完成季度计划，尤其是重点工程完成得较差。其原因主要是施工准备工作没有作好，某些领导部门中，也存在着不同程度的自满松劲情绪。因此中南局城工部和中南财经委员会，根据中南局的指示，会同中南各专业局、处、行，组成了九十人的基本建设工作检查组，以一个月的时间，至中南各重点工程，进行检查。检查以计划管理与区域管理责任制的贯彻及施工准备工作为中心内容。现检查组已分为四个小组，出发前往郑州、焦作、南昌、株州及武汉冶地区检查。
