Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th. TASS Moscow, June 6th: "Pravda" reporters Zhukov, Prishevsky, and Rasakin report from Geneva: Foreign ministers did not hold a meeting on May 5th. They will also not hold a meeting on the 6th, because no one has signed up to speak in the discussion of the Korean issue, and the discussion of the Indochina issue has not yet begun. The ostensible reason is that representatives of the two Indochinese "member states" -- Laos and Cambodia -- invited by the three Western countries have not yet arrived in Geneva. However, commentators here offer a different explanation for this sudden standstill. For example, the "Journal de Genève" said: "It seems the West has decided to use this respite to consolidate its own badly shaken unity... because negotiations cannot be conducted under the slogan of 'every man for himself.'"

The reporters continued: Many newspapers have pointed out that Dulles' political failure in Geneva and his departure from here delivered a blow to the U.S. delegation. However, having recovered, it is now resuming its activities, attempting to restore the bankrupt "Atlantic discipline" among its allies and prevent any agreement from being reached in Geneva. Commentators are also paying particular attention to the U.S. delegation's behind-the-scenes negotiations to assemble the infamous Southeast Asia "Defense Group," which U.S. diplomatic authorities heavily promoted on the eve of the Geneva Conference. It is reported that the U.S. delegation wants to take advantage of the presence of representatives from Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines, and the three Indochinese federal member states in Geneva to achieve the goal of assembling this military bloc.

The reporters pointed out: As everyone knows, what has already happened at the Geneva Conference is far from what Dulles had hoped. Representatives of many countries participating in the conference are unwilling to collude with each other on new aggression plans, but prefer to seek an agreement that helps to peacefully resolve international disputes. For example, the British delegation prefers to adopt a more cautious stance, rather than doing what the U.S. State Department dictates. However, the U.S. delegation, determined to act recklessly at all costs, is sparing no effort to suppress the resistance of its allies, attempting to force them to jointly launch a "crusade" against the national liberation movements of the Asian peoples. The purpose of the U.S. plan to establish a "Southeast Asia Alliance" is: first, to establish a united front of colonial countries to counter national liberation movements; and second, to seize colonies that are still in the hands of old-line colonial powers under the guise of organizing "joint actions." U.S. politicians have not given up their attempts to drag Japan into the "Southeast Asia Alliance." This situation is by no means a good omen for those "old-line" colonial countries.

The dispatch then pointed out: Those who most openly advocate U.S. colonial policies, such as U.S. Senate Republican Leader Knowland, are so annoyed by the British ruling group's unwillingness to unconditionally support U.S. plans that they cannot conceal their annoyance. In a recent conversation with the "Daily News," Knowland told Dulles to ignore the attitude taken by the U.S.'s Western European allies. Several aspects of Knowland's conversation are particularly noteworthy. But one of the main features is that this conversation is tantamount to admitting that the U.S. has become isolated on the international stage.

The "Pravda" reporters concluded: Whether U.S. political figures are willing or not, the historical process in Asia will lead to the complete and final failure of the colonizers. The national liberation struggles of the Asian peoples cannot be suppressed!

### “真理报”记者发表评论指出  美国在日内瓦加紧拼凑东南亚侵略集团

    “真理报”记者发表评论指出
    美国在日内瓦加紧拼凑东南亚侵略集团
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：“真理报”记者茹科夫、普利歇夫斯基和拉萨金自日内瓦报道：五月五日，外长们没有举行会议。他们在六日也将不举行会议，因为没有人报名在朝鲜问题的讨论中发言，印度支那问题的讨论尚未开始。表面上的原因是：三个西方国家所邀请的两个印度支那“联邦成员国”——寮国、高棉——的代表还没有赶到日内瓦。但是，这里的评论员却对这一突然停滞另有解释。例如：“日内瓦日报”说：“看来西方已决定利用这一暂息时间来巩固它们自己已动摇得很厉害的团结……因为在‘人人各尽自己的力量自救吧’的口号下是不能进行谈判的。”
    记者继续写道：许多报纸都指出：杜勒斯在日内瓦遭到政治失败而离开这里，使美国代表团受到一阵打击，然而在复原过来以后，它现在又重新开始活动，企图在它的盟国之间恢复那已经破产的“大西洋纪律”，并阻止在日内瓦达成任何协议。评论员们同时也特别注意美国代表团在幕后所进行的拼凑臭名远扬的东南亚“防务集团”的谈判，在日内瓦会议前夕，美国外交当局曾大肆宣传这一集团。据悉，美国代表团想利用英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、菲律宾和印度支那三个联邦成员国的代表聚集在日内瓦的机会，来达到拼凑这一军事集团的目的。
    记者指出：大家知道，日内瓦会议上已经发生的情况远非像杜勒斯原来所希望的一样。参加会议的许多国家的代表都不愿在新的侵略计划上互相勾结，而愿寻找一个有助于和平解决国际争端的协议。例如，英国代表团宁愿采取更加谨慎的立场，而不愿按照美国国务院所指定的那样来做。然而，决定不顾一切地蛮干的美国代表团正在不遗余力地压制它的盟国的反抗，企图迫使它们共同对亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动发起“十字军”。美国建立“东南亚同盟”计划的目的是：一、建立一条殖民国家统一战线来对抗民族解放运动；二、以组织“联合行动”为幌子，来夺取现在仍然在老牌殖民国家手中的殖民地。美国政客们并没有放弃将日本拖入“东南亚同盟”的企图。这种情况对于那些“老牌”殖民国家决非吉兆。
    通讯接着指出：最公开不讳地宣扬美国殖民政策的人，像美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰之流，对于英国统治集团不愿意无条件支持美国的计划，已恼怒到不能加以掩饰。诺兰在他最近对“每日新闻报”的一次谈话中，要杜勒斯不要理睬美国的西欧盟国所采取的态度。诺兰的这次谈话有几个方面特别值得注意。但其中一个主要的特点是这篇谈话等于承认美国在国际舞台上已陷于孤立。
      “真理报”记者最后写道：不管美国的政界人物愿不愿意，亚洲的历史进程将导致殖民者的彻底的最后的失败。亚洲各国人民的民族解放斗争是压制不了的！
