The Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, is one of the largest agricultural production cooperatives in China. It was established in the spring of 1952. The vast majority of its members were formerly long-term laborers for the nine major landlords in the area, with more than sixty households having worked for the same landlord. During the land reform, although they were allocated land and some means of production, they still faced many difficulties in independent production. Some three or four households shared an ox, and some two households shared a plow. Most farmers urgently wanted to solve the difficulties in production and livelihood. In addition, the concentrated land and convenient irrigation conditions in the area led the People's Government to send cadres to guide them in establishing a cooperative. The Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative was established under these circumstances, bypassing the mutual aid team stage and directly forming a cooperative. Currently, the cooperative has 295 member households (1,465 people) and more than 7,500 mu of land. Public property includes more than 2,600 sheep, 5 camels, 2 new-style horse-drawn seeders, 43 new-style farm tools, 39 oxen, 28 horses, 10 donkeys, and more than 40,000 jin of public reserve grain.

However, this cooperative was a poor one when it was established. It faced a severe spring famine at the very beginning. The situation at the time was that there were no seeds for planting, livestock lacked fodder, and many members did not have enough food. The cooperative actively led members in developing sideline occupations for self-salvation. The People's Government also provided the cooperative with a large number of agricultural loans. The first year's spring plowing demonstrated the superiority of being organized. The cooperative not only completed spring sowing ahead of schedule but also opened up more than 500 mu of wasteland. The autumn harvest was also completed earlier than in previous years. In the first year of the cooperative's establishment, the unit area yield increased by more than 30% compared to before the cooperative's establishment, and the total grain output of the cooperative increased by 65% compared to before the cooperative's establishment, with an average of more than 660 jin of grain distributed per person. In 1953, due to further improvements in farming techniques, reducing the area of fallow land, uniformly adjusting the stubble, and implementing rational crop rotation, the cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total output increase of more than 76% compared to 1952, and an average of more than 1,200 jin of grain distributed per person. The nine farmers who withdrew from the cooperative at the end of 1952 secretly competed with the agricultural production cooperative, believing that they would definitely have more income than the members, but they failed to catch up. Increased income created conditions for expanding production. The cooperative added many livestock and farm tools, basically solving the problem of insufficient means of production. Many members not only had enough food but also sewed new quilts and bought new felt, and women and children wore cotton-padded clothes. According to incomplete statistics of the cooperative, a total of 193 new quilts and more than 1,730 new cotton-padded clothes, fur coats, and single clothes were sewn last winter and this spring. The phenomenon of women not wearing cotton-padded coats in winter was no longer found. In 1952, member Ding Yuming and his wife shared a pair of pants. When the wife went out, he stayed at home, and when he went out, the wife could not get off the kang (heated platform bed). Last year, his whole family sewed new clothes and also bought a horse. Before liberation, member He Zhaofang was so poor that he did not even have a chicken. After participating in the cooperative for two years, he bought a horse and five donkeys.

The Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative grew up with the active support of the local Communist Party Committee and the People's Government. After the establishment of the cooperative, local Party and government organs sent cadres to help solve problems in production and encouraged members to overcome difficulties. Zhang Desheng, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, personally went to provide guidance. As a result, the cooperative gradually consolidated. Some members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative did not withdraw because their income increased significantly in the first year of joining. Some members' motives for joining the cooperative were to rely on government relief. Therefore, when the cooperative was first established, they went to the government for seeds and food. Cadres led members in criticizing the mentality of reliance and insisted on the policy of self-salvation, organizing members to engage in transportation, firewood gathering, and other activities to overcome the difficulties of the lean season. In production, some members worked in the cooperative during slack months but engaged in sideline production for themselves during busy months, trying to take advantage of the situation. The cooperative criticized this idea and established a system. Some members were also handicraftsmen at the same time. In production, conflicts arose between handicraft production and agricultural production. Because the busy season for agriculture was also the time when handicraftsmen had the most work, these members could not participate in agricultural production if they did handicraft work. Members engaged in agricultural production had opinions about them not participating in agricultural production. During the rectification of the agricultural production cooperative, the withdrawal of 40 handicraft households was approved. In sideline production, the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative once took a detour. In 1952, in order to overcome the spring famine, the cooperative established some workshops that had little or no connection with agricultural production. Some of these workshops hired workers for production, forming exploitation. Later, the cooperative realized that the direction of sideline production was incorrect, canceled sideline production that had little connection with agriculture, and completely organized members to carry out sideline production themselves.

Regarding the profit distribution method, it was initially decided to distribute profits uniformly throughout the cooperative. However, because the cooperative was very large, the land, labor, and livestock conditions of each production team were different, and everyone was afraid of losing out. Therefore, some members were not active in production. Later, it was changed to using the team as the unit of production and profit distribution. Because the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative had 15 production teams, and one production team was equivalent to an agricultural production cooperative, the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative was a "federated cooperative." Members were very satisfied with this method of profit distribution. Through continuous improvement of land profit distribution and livestock use, the cooperative gradually consolidated.

The Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative has become a banner in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Yongchang County, driving the surrounding individual farmers to gradually organize. In 1952, because the cooperative overcame the spring famine and completed sowing ahead of schedule, it influenced the nearby villages of Caojiawa, Simo Village, and Xiazhongba to establish mutual aid teams one after another. In that year, the unit area yields of both the cooperative and the mutual aid teams increased, further enhancing the surrounding farmers' understanding of the benefits of being organized. In the spring of 1953, Xiasanba established an agricultural production cooperative on the basis of mutual aid teams. Last year, the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and the surrounding mutual aid teams expressed their desire to learn from the cooperative. This year, the mutual aid teams in Caojiawa, Simo Village, and Xiazhongba have successively upgraded to agricultural production cooperatives. They often went to the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative to absorb the experience of establishing a cooperative and farming techniques, and invited cadres and members of the cooperative to specifically help them. The Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative also often invited nearby cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to hold seminars, exchange production experiences, lead them to the fields to observe fine varieties, and visit new-style farm tools.

Last year, after studying the state's general task during the transition period, the members of the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative had a clearer understanding of the development direction of the agricultural production cooperative. They actively sold surplus grain to the state, with the entire cooperative selling more than 440,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Before joining the cooperative, member Wang Luxian worked as a long-term laborer for landlords for more than 30 years. He had surplus grain in the first year of joining the cooperative and sold more than 1,500 jin of grain to the state last year. He said: "In the past, we couldn't even feed ourselves, let alone have grain to sell. Our cooperative has only been established for two years, and we can't eat all the grain. Only by taking the road of collectivization can we change from poor to rich." Member Zhao Diancheng said: "If we don't take the road of collectivization, some people can't eat or wear enough, and when difficulties arise, they can only sell livestock and land. As a result, a few people get rich, and most people become poor. Now we are taking the road of common prosperity."

This year, after more than a month of deliberation and discussion by all members, the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative has formulated a patriotic production increase plan for this year on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. The cooperative plans to plant 8,412 mu of various crops (including wasteland), with a total output increase of 10.3% compared to last year. In response to the call of the People's Government, it plans to plant more oil crops. Further improvements are also proposed in farming techniques compared to last year. All members are confident in completing the plan. They have also launched a patriotic production increase competition with nine agricultural production cooperatives in Jiuquan, Wushan, Pingliang, and other places.

    焦家庄农业生产合作社的成长
    新华社记者　冯森龄　马玉平
    甘肃省永昌县焦家庄农业生产合作社，是我国目前大型的农业生产合作社之一，一九五二年春天成立的。绝大部分社员过去全家都是当地九户大地主的长工，其中有六十多户曾是一家地主的长工。土地改革时，他们虽然都分得土地和部分生产资料，但要单独进行生产还有很多困难。有的三四户分一头牛，有的两户分一张犁。多数农民都迫切要求解决生产上和生活上存在的困难，再加上当地土地集中，灌溉方便等条件，人民政府便派干部领导他们建社。焦家庄农业生产合作社就是在这种情况下，没有经过互助组的形式，直接成立社的。现在全社共有社员二百九十五户（一千四百六十五人）、土地七千五百多亩。公共财产有：羊二千六百多只，骆驼五峰，新式马拉播种机两部，新式农具四十三件，牛三十九头，马二十八匹，驴十条，公积金粮食四万多斤。
    但是，这个社在成立时却是个穷社。在刚成立时，就面临着严重的春荒。当时的情况是：地无种籽，牲畜缺乏草料，很多社员口粮不够吃。社里积极领导社员搞副业，生产自救。人民政府也贷给这个社大批农业贷款。第一年的春耕就显示出组织起来的优越性，全社不但提前完成春播，还开了五百多亩荒地。秋收也比往年提前完成。建社第一年，单位面积产量比建社前提高三成多，全社粮食总产量比建社前增加了六成半，平均每人分得粮食六百六十多斤。一九五三年由于进一步改进耕作技术，缩小轮歇地面积，统一调整倒槎，实行合理轮作，全社空前丰收，总产量比一九五二年增加了百分之七十六多，平均每人分得粮食一千二百多斤。一九五二年底退社的九户农民，有些暗地和农业生产合作社比赛，以为一定会比社员收入多，结果没有赶上。收入增加为扩大生产创造了条件，社里添了很多牲畜、农具，基本上解决了生产资料不足的问题。很多社员不但粮食够吃，还缝了新被子，买了新毡，妇女娃娃穿上了花棉衣。据全社不完全统计，去冬今春共缝了新被一百九十三床，新棉衣、皮袄、单衣等一千七百三十多件，妇女过冬不穿棉袄的现象再也找不到了。社员丁玉明一九五二年和老婆伙穿一条裤子，老婆出去他便在家里，他出去老婆便不能下炕。去年他全家都缝了新衣，还买了一匹马。社员何兆芳解放前穷的连一只鸡都没有，参加社两年便买了一匹马和五条驴。
    焦家庄农业生产合作社是在当地中共党委和人民政府积极支持下成长起来的。建社后当地党政机关就派干部帮助解决生产中的问题，鼓励社员克服困难。中共甘肃省委员会书记张德生，甘肃省人民政府主席邓宝珊都先后亲自去指导。因此，使这个社逐渐巩固起来。有些想退社的社员，由于入社第一年收入就有显著增加，就不退了。有些社员的入社动机，是想依赖人民政府救济，因此在社刚成立时，没有种籽找政府，没有口粮也去找政府。干部领导社员批判了依赖思想，坚持了生产自救的方针，组织社员搞运输、打柴等，克服了青黄不接的困难。在生产中，有一部分社员闲月到社劳动，但到忙月却去给自己搞副业生产，想从中占便宜。社内批判了这种思想，并订立了制度。社员中有些人同时又是手工业者，在生产中便发生了手工业生产和农业生产的矛盾。因为农忙时也正是手工业活最多的时候，这些社员去做手工业活就无法参加农业生产。从事农业生产的社员对他们不参加农业生产有意见。农业生产合作社进行整顿时，批准了四十户手工业者退社。在副业生产上，焦家庄农业生产合作社曾经走了弯路。一九五二年为了渡春荒，社里曾开办一些和农业生产没有关系或者关系不大的作坊，有一部分作坊是雇工人生产，形成剥削。后来社里发现副业生产的方针不对，把和农业关系不大的副业生产取消了，副业生产完全组织社员自己来进行。
    关于分红办法，开始确定全社统一分红。但因为社很大，各个生产小组的土地、劳动力、畜力等条件不同，都怕吃亏，因此部分社员生产不积极，后来改为以组为生产和分红单位。因为焦家庄农业生产合作社有十五个生产小组，一个生产小组等于一个农业生产合作社，所以焦家庄农业生产合作社是“联社”性质的社。用这种办法分红，社员很满意。由于不断改进土地分红和畜力使用，使社逐步巩固起来。
    焦家庄农业生产合作社已成了永昌县互助合作运动中的一面旗帜，它带动着周围的单干农民逐渐组织起来。一九五二年由于社战胜了春荒，提前完成了播种，影响了附近的曹家洼、四磨村、下中坝等村先后都成立了互助组，这一年社和互助组的单位面积产量都提高了，使周围的农民进一步认识到组织起来的好处。一九五三年春天，下三坝在互助组的基础上成立了农业生产合作社。去年焦家庄农业生产合作社获得了空前的丰收，周围互助组纷纷表示要向社看齐。今年曹家洼、四磨村、下中坝等村互助组都陆续提高为农业生产合作社。他们经常到焦家庄农业生产合作社吸收建社的经验和耕作技术，并邀请该社干部、社员具体帮助他们。焦家庄农业生产合作社也经常邀请附近的社、互助组和单干农民举行座谈会，交流生产的经验，领他们到田间去观摩优良品种，参观新式农具。
    去年焦家庄农业生产合作社社员学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务之后，对农业生产合作社发展方向有了更明确的认识，他们积极把余粮卖给国家，全社共卖给国家余粮四十四万多斤。社员王禄贤在入社前给地主当了三十多年长工，入社第一年就有了余粮，去年卖给国家一千五百多斤粮食。他说：过去连肚子都混不住，哪里还有粮卖，我们社刚成立了两年，粮食就吃不完了，只有走合作化的道路才能由穷变富。社员赵殿成说：不走合作化道路，有些人吃不上穿不上，发生了困难只有卖牲口卖土地，结果少数人发财，多数人变穷，现在走的是大家共同富裕的道路。
    今年焦家庄农业生产合作社经过全体社员一个多月的酝酿讨论，在去年丰收的基础上，已订出今年爱国增产计划。全社计划种各种作物八千四百十二亩（包括耕荒），总产量比去年增加百分之十点三。为了响应人民政府的号召，计划多种些油料作物。在耕作技术上也提出要比去年有进一步的改进。全体社员都有信心完成计划。他们并向酒泉、武山、平凉等地的九个农业生产合作社提出爱国增产竞赛。
