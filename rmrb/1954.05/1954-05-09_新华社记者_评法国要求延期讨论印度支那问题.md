Commenting on France's Request to Postpone Discussion of the Indochina Issue

[Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 7th dispatch] (Our correspondent Li Ping reports) The discussion of the second item on the agenda of the Geneva Conference – the restoration of peace in Indochina – which was eagerly awaited by all parties, did not begin today. This is because the French side requested a postponement.

Until the morning of the 6th, news from all sides confirmed that the discussion on the Indochina issue would begin on the afternoon of the 7th, and an agreement had been reached on the procedural arrangements for the meeting, and the arrangement of the venue was in full swing. After the French National Assembly held a vote of confidence in the Laniel government on the afternoon of the 6th, news of the postponement of the meeting came from the French side.

The news said that the "reason" for the French delegation's request for postponement was that some representatives of Laos and Cambodia, the member states of the so-called Indochina Federation, had not yet arrived, although Pideault had known their travel dates long before he agreed to start the discussion of the Indochina issue on the 7th.

Originally, Pideault's absent-mindedness during the general debate on the Korean issue was interpreted by reporters here as being due to his eagerness to discuss the Indochina issue. However, in view of the developments in the past two days, the attitude of the French delegation has become a topic of discussion among reporters here. People are almost unanimously questioning: What is the reason for Pideault's two different attitudes?

Reviewing the news from Paris and Washington in the past two days can help people find answers.

In Paris, after the French National Assembly reconvened on the 4th, the voice of the French people demanding an immediate end to the colonial war that has impoverished the people and exhausted the country for the past eight years was once again reflected more intensely in the parliament. At the parliamentary meeting on May 4, most of the deputies who spoke demanded immediate negotiations. "Ceasefire" and "peace" have become the unanimous calls of the vast majority of deputies from the Communist Party to the right-wing groups in the National Assembly. Radical Socialist Party deputy Daladier pointed out: "Today, more than ever, a ceasefire and armistice are needed. Waiting for the resolution of the Geneva Conference to negotiate a ceasefire will harm the fate of the expeditionary force." Independent Peasant Party deputy Badou accused "the government has no right to make more people die." Badou asked: "Why hasn't the war been extinguished when the Indochina conference in Geneva is about to be held?"

It was under these circumstances that the arrangements concerning the procedure and technical aspects of starting the discussion on the Indochina issue – such as the chairman of the meeting, the date of the meeting, the arrangement of the venue, etc. – were accelerated. However, even so, many sources said that the French delegation did not have an independent policy for restoring peace in Indochina. Many plans for the partition of Indochina have been put forward, starting with the 14th parallel north as the dividing line, then gradually moving north, 16 degrees, 18 degrees, 20 degrees, and recently even pushing to 21 degrees. French public opinion suspects that the government is talking about peace, but is actually continuing the war. For this reason, deputies from various parties in the National Assembly, led by Radical Socialist Party leader Mayer, demanded an early debate on the government's Indochina policy. Laniel's countermeasure was to ask the parliament to vote on a motion of confidence. In the National Assembly vote on the afternoon of the 6th, the Laniel cabinet narrowly survived the crisis with a majority of 49 votes. At this time, in Geneva, the French delegation requested a postponement of the start of the discussion on the Indochina issue.

Pideault is keeping one eye on Paris and the other on Washington. Dulles's letter left before he left, declaring that the United States' firm policy remains unchanged, left a deep impression on Pideault's mind. After Eisenhower announced that "a Southeast Asia security plan is in the process of being organized," the US National Security Council is planning the next US conspiracy with Dulles' participation. Dulles' big stick is still dangling on the shores of Lake Leman. Observers here believe that this is the background to the ambiguous attitude of the French side in the past two days.

Naturally, the second item on the agenda of the Geneva Conference will still begin to be discussed. This does not depend on the subjective wishes of those short-sighted politicians. The power of the people demanding peace is irresistible. However, during the two-day adjournment of the Geneva Conference, the informal seven-nation talks on the Korean issue were not held, and today's meeting still shows that the US side is continuing to adopt a rigid policy, and the discussion of the Indochina issue is still delayed. All this shows that the US obstruction policy is still continuing, and complex struggles are unfolding inside and outside the conference. The success of the Geneva Conference depends on further efforts by the forces of peace.

    评法国要求延期讨论印度支那问题
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】本社记者李平报道：受到各方殷切期待的日内瓦会议第二项议程——恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论，今天没有开始。这是因为法国方面要求推迟举行。
    直到六日上午，来自各方面的消息都证实，七日下午将开始关于印度支那问题的讨论，有关会议的程序安排已经达成了协议，会场的布置也正紧张地进行。当六日下午法国国民议会举行了对拉尼埃政府的信任投票之后，延期开会的消息，就从法国方面传出来了。
    消息说，法国代表团要求延期的“理由”是所谓印度支那联邦成员国的寮国和高棉的一些代表还没有到达，虽然在这以前，皮杜尔在同意从七日起开始印度支那问题的讨论时，就早已知道这些代表的行期了。
    原来皮杜尔在朝鲜问题一般辩论期间心不在焉的神态，曾被此间的记者们解释为是由于急欲讨论印度支那问题。但是鉴于这两天来事态的发展，法国代表团的态度已成了此间记者中纷纷议论的题目。人们几乎一致地发出疑问：皮杜尔前后两种不同态度的原因在哪里呢？
    翻阅一下过去两天来从巴黎和华盛顿传来的消息，可以帮助人们找寻答案。
    在巴黎，法国国民议会于四日复会后，全法国人民要求立即停止八年来弄得民穷财尽的殖民战争的声音又一次在议会中获得了更加激烈的反映。五月四日的议会会议上，发言的大部分议员都要求立即谈判。“停火”、“和平”已经成为国民议会内从共产党到右翼集团各党各派绝大多数议员的一致呼声。激进社会党议员达拉第指出：“今天比以往更需要停火和停战。等待日内瓦会议的决议来谈判停火，这将损害到远征军的命运。”独立农民党议员巴杜指责“政府没有权利使更多的人死亡”。巴杜质问道：“为什么到日内瓦的印度支那会议要举行的时候，战火还没有熄灭？”
    正是在这种情况下，关于开始讨论印度支那问题的程序和技术的安排——诸如会议的主席、会议的日期、会场的布置等等——才加快了速度。但是，即使如此，许多消息说，法国代表团并没有一个恢复印度支那和平的独立政策。有许多印度支那分治的方案被提出来，开始是以北纬十四度为分界线，接着就一步一步地向北推移，十六度、十八度、二十度，最近竟推到二十一度了。法国舆论怀疑政府说的是和平，做的是继续战争。因为这个缘故，国民议会中以激进社会党领袖麦耶为首的各党派议员要求及早就政府的印度支那政策进行辩论。拉尼埃的对策是要求议会投信任票。六日下午国民议会投票结果，拉尼埃内阁以四十九票的多数侥幸渡过了危机。就在这个时候，在日内瓦，法国代表团要求推迟开始印度支那问题的讨论了。
      皮杜尔一只眼睛看着巴黎，另一只眼睛瞧着华盛顿。杜勒斯临去前留下的、声言美国的坚定政策不变的信，在皮杜尔的脑海里留下深刻的印象。在艾森豪威尔宣布“一个东南亚安全计划正在组织过程中”之后，美国的国家安全委员会正在杜勒斯的参加下筹划美国下一步的阴谋。杜勒斯的大棍子仍在莱蒙湖畔摇幌。此间观察家认为，这就是两天来法国方面的暧昧态度的背景。
    自然，日内瓦会议的第二项议程还是要开始讨论的。这不决定于那些短视的政治家的主观愿望，要求和平的人民的力量是不可抗拒的。但是，日内瓦会议在过去两天的休会期间，非正式商谈朝鲜问题的七国会谈没有举行，今日的会议依然显示美国方面还继续采取僵硬政策，印度支那问题的讨论又迟迟不能开始，这一切说明，美国的阻挠政策仍在继续着，会内会外复杂的斗争正在展开，日内瓦会议的成功有赖于和平力量的进一步的努力。
