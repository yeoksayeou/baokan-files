Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 28th: The Geneva Conference held its twelfth plenary session on the Korean issue at 3:00 PM on the 28th, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Eden.

    The Geneva Conference's discussions on the Korean issue have now lasted for more than a month. A month ago, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, put forward reasonable proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which received the support of China and the Soviet Union and the sympathy of world opinion. Even some of the United States' allies believed that this proposal deserved study and attention. However, due to the United States' insistence on the illegal resolutions of the United Nations and opposition to holding free all-Korean elections, the discussions on the Korean issue have made no progress. On May 22nd, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai further suggested that neutral countries supervise the all-Korean elections, in order to break the deadlock caused by the United States' insistence on unreasonable demands. Zhou Enlai's proposal was considered by public opinion to be a constructive effort to push the conference forward. Under the repeated efforts of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, fair-minded public opinion believes that if the United States has the slightest sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, it should consider the proposals of North Korea and China in a spirit of consultation, instead of continuing to attempt to impose the illegal resolutions of the United Nations on others and hindering the progress of the conference. However, the situation at the meeting on the 28th showed that the United States is still making every effort to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and still has no sincerity in reaching an agreement.

    The characteristic of the May 28th meeting was that the representatives of some countries, headed by the United States, who participated in the intervention in Korea, disregarded the fact that the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, has become a belligerent party in Korea and therefore lost its qualification to mediate the Korean issue, insisting that the peaceful unification of Korea must still be intervened by the United Nations. They supported the so-called "proposal" put forward by the South Korean representative on May 22nd and opposed the proposal of Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 27th and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal on May 22nd regarding neutral countries supervising the all-Korean elections, although they still cannot put forward any tenable reasons.

    The first speaker was US representative Smith. Smith tried hard to make people believe that the United Nations was not a belligerent party in Korea. He stubbornly described the United States' manipulation of the United Nations and forcing other countries to intervene in Korea with the United States as for "collective security" and "moral principles." He also mentioned the United Nations Charter, but in fact, the United States' act of bringing the Korean issue, which was purely a matter of internal affairs, to the United Nations in 1947 was a violation of the United Nations Charter. And the United States' manipulation of the United Nations Security Council in June 1950 to pass illegal resolutions to interfere in Korea in the absence of representatives of the permanent members, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, had nothing in common with the purpose of the United Nations Charter. Smith actually completely disregarded the United Nations Charter, but attempted to tamper with the United Nations Charter, treating the United Nations as a tool that he could arbitrarily direct. He accused the Soviet Union of opposing the unreasonable demands of the United States in the United Nations organization, only because the legitimate actions taken by the Soviet Union to safeguard the United Nations Charter hindered the United States from using the United Nations as a tool for aggression.

    Smith unreasonably opposed Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il's proposal. He vainly attempted to attribute the lack of progress in the discussion of the Korean issue to North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. But the fact is: Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il put forward a fair and reasonable proposal on April 27th, while the United States did not piece together a "proposal" until May 22nd and hand it over to Byun Yung-tai to put forward, and this "proposal" was nothing more than a concretization of the unreasonable demands that the United States had stubbornly insisted on from the first day of the conference. What he particularly opposed was the organization of the all-Korean committee proposed by Nam Il, because in this committee with equal participation from both sides, the Syngman Rhee clique would not be able to impose its dark rule on the Korean people as it pleased, thereby "restricting" the Syngman Rhee clique. He believed that if Nam Il's proposal was agreed to, it would "tie our hands," that is to say, the United States could no longer continue to interfere in the name of the United Nations and treat Korea as a colony of the United States.

    Smith stated that the United States would never abandon the principle of the United Nations interfering in Korea. He was particularly dissatisfied with the principle upheld by the North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet delegations that the Korean people should handle their own affairs and the denial that the United Nations, as a belligerent party in Korea, is qualified to interfere in the peaceful unification of Korea. He was very afraid of resolving the Korean issue by freeing it from United Nations interference. Smith demanded that the conference accept the "proposal" put forward by Byun Yung-tai on May 22nd, which was manufactured by the United States. However, he could not give any reason other than saying that this proposal was in line with the intentions of the United States.

    Smith's speech shows that the US authorities refuse any consultation and insist on obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The next speaker was Colombian representative Francisco Urrutia Olano. Olano believed that recognizing the United Nations' right to interfere in Korea was a prerequisite for the conference to reach an agreement. He echoed the US's claim, attempting to impose the illegal resolutions of the United Nations on the Korean people.

    Turkish representative Asikalin and Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon spoke next. Their speeches boiled down to only one sentence: the fate of the Korean people should be completely dictated by the belligerent party, the United Nations, that is to say, it should be arbitrarily controlled by the United States. They both supported Byun Yung-tai's so-called fourteen-point proposal.

    Australian representative Watt acknowledged in his speech that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal on the formation of a neutral nations supervisory commission, made at the last meeting, was an "important development." He also stated that he "welcomes any development that can bring opposing views closer together." However, he immediately opposed the principle put forward by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il that no foreign forces should interfere in Korean internal affairs, and opposed the formation of an all-Korean committee, and groundlessly asserted that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal was not a real progress towards an agreement. Watt still believed that the Korean elections should be held under the auspices of the United Nations. While Watt said that he would "reserve the right to examine Byun Yung-tai's proposal in detail at a later stage of the discussion," he self-deceivingly said that this proposal provided a better opportunity to discuss the issue.

    The last speaker was Greek representative Kindynis. Kindynis once again brought out the illegal resolution of the United Nations of October 7, 1950, as the basis for resolving the Korean issue, although everyone knows that it was under the cover of this illegal resolution that the US troops crossed the 38th parallel and invaded North Korea, and in the three years of combat, the plan approved by this illegal resolution to conquer the entire Korea by US military force has not been realized.

    After the Greek representative spoke, no one asked to speak. The chairman announced that, as far as he understood, a meeting on the Indochina issue would be held on the 29th. The time for the next meeting on the Korean issue will be announced separately.

    The meeting adjourned at half past five.

    日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
     【新华社日内瓦二十八日电】日内瓦会议于二十八日下午三时举行关于朝鲜问题的第十二次全体会议，由英国外交大臣艾登担任主席。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论到现在已经进行了一个多月。一个月之前，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日就提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议，这个建议得到了中、苏两国的支持和世界舆论的同情。甚至美国的一些盟国也认为这个建议值得研究和重视。但是由于美国坚持联合国的非法决议，反对举行全朝鲜自由选举，以致关于朝鲜问题的讨论没有任何进展。五月二十二日，周恩来外长又建议由中立国监察全朝鲜选举，以期打开由于美国坚持无理主张而造成的僵持局面。周恩来的建议被舆论认为是推动会议向前进展的建设性的努力。在朝、中、苏三国的一再努力之下，公正的舆论都认为，美国如果稍有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，就应该以协商的精神来考虑朝、中两国的建议，而不应该继续企图将联合国的非法决议强加于人，阻挠会议的进展。但是二十八日会议的情形却表明，美国依然竭力阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，依然没有达成协议的丝毫诚意。
    二十八日会议的特点是以美国为首的参加干涉朝鲜的一些国家的代表们不顾联合国在美国操纵下已经成为在朝鲜交战一方、因而丧失了调处朝鲜问题的资格这一事实，坚持朝鲜的和平统一仍然必须由联合国来进行干涉。他们支持南朝鲜代表在五月二十二日提出的所谓“建议”，反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相的四月二十七日的建议和周恩来外长五月二十二日关于中立国监察全朝鲜选举的补充建议，虽然他们仍然提不出任何站得住脚的理由来。
    首先发言的是美国代表史密斯。史密斯竭力要使人相信联合国不是在朝鲜交战的一方，他硬把美国操纵联合国、迫使其他国家和美国一起干涉朝鲜，说成是什么为了“集体安全”和“道德原则”。他也提到联合国宪章，但是事实上，美国在一九四七年把纯属内政问题的朝鲜问题提到联合国去，就是违反联合国宪章的行为。而美国在一九五零年六月操纵联合国安全理事会，在常任理事国苏联和中华人民共和国代表缺席的情况下通过干涉朝鲜的非法决议案，更是与联合国宪章的宗旨毫无共同之点。史密斯实际上完全不把联合国宪章放在眼里，而是企图纂改联合国宪章，把联合国当作可以由他任意指使的工具。他指责苏联在联合国组织中反对美国的无理主张，只是因为苏联为了维护联合国宪章而采取的正当行动，妨碍了美国利用联合国作为进行侵略的工具罢了。
    史密斯毫无道理地反对南日外务相的建议。他徒然地企图把朝鲜问题的讨论没有进展归咎于朝、中、苏三国。但是事实是：南日外务相在四月二十七日就提出了公正合理的建议，而美国一直到五月二十二日才拼凑一个“建议”交给卞荣泰提出来，而这个“建议”只不过是美国从会议的第一天起所顽固坚持的无理主张的具体化罢了。他特别反对的是南日所建议的全朝鲜委员会的组织，因为在这个双方平等的委员会中李承晚集团不能为所欲为地把它的黑暗统治强加于朝鲜人民，从而会“束缚”了李承晚集团。他认为，如果同意了南日的建议，就会“缚住我们的手”，也就是说，美国不能再用联合国的名义继续干涉，把朝鲜当作美国的殖民地。
    史密斯表示，美国决不放弃由联合国干涉朝鲜的原则。他特别不满朝、中、苏代表团坚持由朝鲜人民自己处理自己的事务的原则和否认作为在朝鲜交战一方的联合国有资格干涉朝鲜的和平统一。他十分害怕使朝鲜问题从联合国干涉下解脱出来求得解决。史密斯要求大会接受美国一手制造的卞荣泰在五月二十二日提出的“建议”。可是他除了说这个建议是符合美国的意图以外，说不出任何理由来。
    史密斯的发言表明，美国当局拒绝任何协商，坚持阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    接着发言的是哥伦比亚代表弗朗西斯科·乌鲁蒂亚·奥尔根。奥尔根认为，承认联合国干涉朝鲜的权利是会议取得协议的先决条件。他附和美国的主张，企图把联合国的非法决议强加于朝鲜人民。
    土耳其代表阿西卡林和泰国代表旺亲王接着发言。他们的发言归结起来只有一句话：朝鲜人民的命运应该完全由交战一方的联合国来摆布，也就是说，应该由美国来任意支配。他们都支持卞荣泰的所谓十四点建议。
    澳大利亚代表瓦特在发言中承认周恩来外长在上次会议上所提出的关于成立中立国监察委员会的补充建议是一个“重要的发展”。他还表示，他“欢迎任何可使对立见解接近的发展”。然而他紧接着又反对南日外务相所提出的不得由外力干涉朝鲜内政的原则，反对成立全朝鲜委员会，而毫无根据地断言周恩来外长的补充建议不是走向协议的真正进展。瓦特仍然认为朝鲜的选举应该在联合国的主持之下举行。瓦特一面表示他要“保留权利在讨论的后一阶段再来详细审查”卞荣泰的建议，一面却又自欺欺人地说，这个建议提供了讨论问题的较好的机会。
    最后一个发言的是希腊代表金迪尼斯。金迪尼斯又把一九五零年十月七日的联合国非法决议案搬了出来作为解决朝鲜问题的根据，虽然谁都知道，美国军队正是在这个非法决议掩饰之下越过三八线向北朝鲜进犯的，而在三年的作战中，并没有实现这个非法决议所批准的由美国武力征服全朝鲜的计划。
    希腊代表发言后，没有人要求发言。主席宣布：据他了解，二十九日将举行关于印度支那问题的会议。下次关于朝鲜问题的会议的时间，另行通知。
    会议于五时半休会。
