Construction workers in Shenyang are increasing their work efficiency and exceeding the Northeast region's 1954 labor quotas. At construction site 907, thanks to thorough ideological education for the workers and rational reorganization of labor, 25 groups have now surpassed the new quotas. Cui Jifa's bricklaying group from the fourth work area of the Northeast Sixth Engineering Company uses a mortar spreader and a two-handed mortar squeezing method when laying large walls, and a "one spread, one squeeze" bricklaying method when building pier walls, exceeding the new quota by 46%. Li Changzhen's carpentry group from the same work area exceeded the new quota by 62% due to the promotion of advanced experience in elevated formwork support. Liang Huashan's brick carrying group at construction site 219 adopted a流水作业 (assembly line) approach, exceeding the new quota by more than 20%. Li Tingxun's scaffolding group from the Northeast Third Engineering Company adopted a "two-building assembly line method," exceeding the new quota by 36%. The steel reinforcement group led by Meng Xianzhang at construction site 219 held a successful technical research meeting, where everyone brainstormed ideas and methods, exceeding the new quota by 58% and saving 1.8 tons of steel. Currently, joyful news of exceeding new quotas is spreading everywhere on construction sites throughout the city. (Our Northeast Correspondent)

    沈阳市建筑工人纷纷超过新的劳动定额
    沈阳市建筑工人提高工作效率，纷纷超过东北区一九五四年的劳动定额。九○七工地由于向工人进行了深入的思想教育，合理整顿了劳动组织，现在已有二十五个小组突破了新定额。东北第六工程公司四工区崔吉发瓦工组，砌大墙时用铺灰器和双手挤浆法，砌垛子墙就用一铺一挤砌砖法，因而超过新定额百分之四十六。同一工区的李长珍木工组，由于推广了架空支模板的先进经验，超过新定额百分之六十二。二一九工地梁华山挑砖组采取流水作业后，突破新定额百分之二十以上，东北第三工程公司架子工李廷训组采取“两幢大流水作业法”，突破了新定额百分之三十六。二一九工地孟宪章钢筋工小组，由于开好了技术研究会，大家开动脑筋想办法，除超过新定额百分之五十八外，并节省钢筋一点八吨。目前在全市建筑工地上，到处传着突破新定额的捷音。（本报东北记者站）
