Xinhua News Agency, 12th: According to Soviet newspapers: The Soviet Union's spring reclamation work is proceeding rapidly. Agricultural laborers are carrying out socialist competitions to quickly complete the wasteland reclamation plan and ensure the quality of work, in order to expand grain production.

In the Tyumen region of the Urals, where the virgin land is located, the snow has just melted recently, and many collective farmers and workers from machine tractor stations have immediately plunged into intense reclamation work. The Frunze Collective Farm in the Tyumen district was the first to start land reclamation in the area. With the help of tractor drivers from the Tyumen Machine Tractor Station, the farm plowed 50 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) of virgin land in the first three days, with a plowing depth of 25 centimeters. The plowing of virgin land in the Lenin, Stalin, Andreyev, and Michurin collective farms in the Isetsk district is also proceeding quickly, with the plowing depth in many sections reaching 30 centimeters. The Ozyornovsk Machine Tractor Station in the Giprolovsk district of the Chkalov region, in order to strengthen the manpower and technical equipment for reclamation work, recently increased the original four tractor teams to six and supplemented them with ten tractors and other farming implements. The six tractor teams are currently engaged in a heated competition to accelerate the reclamation of wasteland. The tractor team led by Korbanova, due to continuous day and night reclamation of wasteland in shifts, has plowed more than 200 hectares of virgin land for the Kuibyshev Collective Farm. The Chelyabinsk region in the southern Urals plans to reclaim 440,000 hectares of virgin and cultivated land this year, and reclamation work is currently proceeding rapidly in the fields of many collective farms and state farms. By April 28th, tens of thousands of hectares of newly reclaimed land had been sown with spring wheat.

The reclamation work in the Kazakh Republic is progressing smoothly. By the 6th of this month, the machine tractor stations in North Kazakhstan Oblast alone had plowed more than 10,000 hectares of virgin land for collective farms. Now, hard-grain varieties of spring wheat are being sown on these new lands using cross-seeding and narrow-row seeding methods. The laboring farmers of Kustanai Oblast have launched a competition craze to quickly reclaim wasteland. The initiator of the competition, the Leonid tractor team in the Fedorovsk district, plowed 200 hectares of virgin land for the "Red October" collective farm it serves in a short period of time. The tractor drivers complete an average of one and a half work quotas per day. In Akmolinsk Oblast, the first to start reclaiming wasteland was the tractor team led by Kovalev of the Krasivsk Machine Tractor Station. Last year, Kovalev harvested an average of 23 quintals of spring wheat per hectare (1 quintal equals 200 Chinese jin) on the land he reclaimed. His experience proves that the earlier the wasteland is plowed, the better. Therefore, when the snow in the fields had not yet melted this spring, he led the tractor team and motivated other tractor teams to plow the wasteland in the fields. Under his leadership, the Krasivsk Machine Tractor Station plowed dozens of hectares of wasteland for the Khrushchev Collective Farm on the first day.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Soviet Union will build 1,000 rural thermal and hydroelectric power stations this year with a total generating capacity of 74,000 kilowatts, and a number of hydroelectric power stations have been completed recently.

According to TASS: The Ukrainian Republic is building dozens of rural thermal and hydroelectric power stations. Among them, a hydroelectric power station built on the banks of the Dniester River has been completed and has begun to supply electricity to two collective farms. Now, thousands of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations in the Ukrainian Republic have been electrified. There are about 50,000 electric motors used in agriculture, which is fifteen times more than in 1940. The Sergeievsk hydroelectric power station in the Stavropol Territory of the Russian Federation has recently been completed on the Novonomysky Canal and has begun to generate electricity. Since the end of the Patriotic War, about 40 rural hydroelectric power stations have been built in the Stavropol Territory, and collective farms have more than 3,500 electric motors. The comprehensive electrification of the Cherkessk Autonomous Oblast and several other oblasts in the territory has been completed. The new Trolizkoye and Orlovska rural hydroelectric power stations are currently under construction in the territory. The day when the territory will have complete rural electrification is not far off. In the Georgian Republic, the Ginkish hydroelectric power station in the Kobuleti district was completed on the eve of the "May 1st" International Labor Day. This hydroelectric power station will serve eight collective farms, and it has now begun to generate electricity for four of them. Due to the construction of rural power stations, the level of electrification of agricultural production labor in the collective farms of the Estonian Republic has increased by 50% in recent years. Three hydroelectric power stations are under construction on the Kunda River, the Petya River, and the Painkula River in the republic.

Along with the construction of rural power stations, the Soviet countryside is also erecting 50,000 kilometers of high-voltage and low-voltage power lines and building more than 7,000 transformer substations in order to connect the state power systems, industrial and public power station networks of Leningrad, Gorky, Kiev, and many other oblasts with collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations, increasing the power supply to rural areas.

    苏联春季开垦荒地工作迅速进行
    今年将建成一千个农村火力和水力发电站
    【新华社十二日讯】据苏联报纸消息：苏联今年春季的开垦工作正在迅速展开。农业劳动者正在开展社会主义竞赛，争取迅速完成开垦荒地的计划并保证工作质量，以扩大谷物生产。
    乌拉尔地区秋门州生荒地上的积雪最近刚刚融化，许多集体农民和机器拖拉机站的工人就立刻投入紧张的开垦工作。秋门区的伏龙芝集体农庄在该区最先开始开荒，在秋门机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手的帮助下，农庄在头三天就翻耕了五十公顷生荒地（每公顷合十五市亩），翻耕深度达二十五公分。伊谢特斯克区的列宁、斯大林、安德烈耶夫和米丘林集体农庄的生荒地的翻耕工作也进行得很快，许多地段的翻耕深度达三十公分。契卡洛夫州吉普洛夫斯克区奥泽尔诺夫斯克机器拖拉机站，为了加强开垦工作的人力和技术配备，最近把原来的四个拖拉机队增加为六个，并补充了十台拖拉机和其他耕地的农具。这六个拖拉机队目前正在热烈展开竞赛，加速开垦荒地。其中由科尔巴诺娃领导的拖拉机队，由于分班昼夜不停地开垦荒地，已为古比雪夫集体农庄翻耕了二百多公顷生荒地。乌拉尔南部的车里雅宾斯克州今年计划要开垦四十四万公顷生荒地和熟荒地，目前开垦工作正在许多集体农庄和国营农场的田野上迅速进行；到四月二十八日，已有数万公顷新开垦的土地播种了春小麦。
    哈萨克共和国的开垦工作进行得很顺利，到本月六日，单是北哈萨克斯坦州的机器拖拉机站就为集体农庄翻耕了一万多公顷生荒地。现在，这些新地上正在使用交叉播种法和窄行播种法播种硬粒品种的春小麦。库斯坦奈州的劳动农民已掀起了争取迅速开垦荒地的竞赛热潮。竞赛发起人费德罗斯克区的列奥尼达拖拉机队，在短时期内就为它所服务的“红十月”集体农庄翻耕了二百公顷生荒地。拖拉机手们每天平均都完成一个半工作定额。在阿克摩林斯克州，最先开始开垦荒地的是克拉西维斯克机器拖拉机站的由科瓦列夫领导的拖拉机队。科瓦列夫去年在他开垦的土地上每公顷平均收二十三公担春小麦（一公担合二百市斤），他的经验证明，翻耕荒地越早越好，因此当今春田野上的积雪还未融完时，他就率领拖拉机队并带动其他拖拉机队到田间翻耕荒地。在他的带头下，克拉西维斯克机器拖拉机站第一天就为赫鲁晓夫集体农庄翻耕了数十公顷荒地。
      【新华社十二日讯】苏联今年将建成一千个总发电能力为七万四千瓩的农村火力发电站和水力发电站，其中有一批水电站已在最近落成。
    据塔斯社消息：乌克兰共和国正在修建几十个农村火力发电站和水力发电站。其中建筑在第聂斯特河岸的一个水电站已经建成，并开始向两个集体农庄供电。现在，乌克兰共和国有几千个集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站已经电气化了，农业中使用的电动机约有五万部，比一九四○年增加了十五倍。俄罗斯联邦斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区塞吉列耶夫斯克水电站，最近已在新诺米斯基运河上建成并开始发电。自卫国战争结束以来，斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区已建成约四十个农村水电站，集体农庄使用的电动机已有三千五百多部。边疆区的契尔克斯克自治州及其他若干州的全面电气化已经完成。目前边疆区还在修建新托洛伊兹科耶和奥尔洛夫斯卡农村水电站。全边疆区农村全盘电气化的日子已为期不远。在格鲁吉亚共和国，科布列第区的金基什水电站，已在“五一”国际劳动节前夕建成。这个水电站将为八个集体农庄服务，现在已开始为其中四个集体农庄发电。由于农村电力站的修建，爱沙尼亚共和国各集体农庄农业生产费力劳动的电气化水平，在最近几年来已提高了百分之五十。共和国的孔达河、彼佳河和帕因库拉河上正在兴建三个水电站。
    和建设农村电力站同时，苏联农村还在架设五万公里高压和低压电线，并建筑七千多个变压器变电所，以便把列宁格勒、高尔基、基辅和其他许多州的国家电力系统、工业和公共电力站网同集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站联结起来，增加农村地区的电力供应。
