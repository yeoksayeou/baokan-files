Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 16th: The basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has preliminarily established a plan to reduce construction costs by over 100 billion yuan this year. The reduction in construction and installation costs could build over 103,000 square meters of residential housing with heating.

When formulating cost reduction plans, the engineering companies affiliated with Anshan Iron and Steel Company mobilized employees for repeated discussions and accepted many suggestions from Soviet experts. Therefore, the final plans formulated by each engineering company exceeded the original savings targets proposed by Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The savings plan formulated by the Furnace Construction Engineering Company was 4% higher than the requirements put forward by Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

In order to ensure the realization of the cost reduction plan, the employees of various engineering companies of Anshan Iron and Steel are actively putting forward rationalization proposals to save project costs in all aspects. The suggestion put forward by the employees of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company to replace lightweight glass with slag and asphalt has reduced costs by more than 4 billion yuan on one construction site alone after being implemented. Employees also suggested using the waste soil excavated from the construction site of the rebuilt third iron smelting furnace as filling soil for the construction site of the Second Primary Rolling Mill, which will not only save a lot of excavation costs, but also save a lot of transportation costs. The Steel Material Warehouse construction site implemented the Soviet experts' suggestion of adding a certain proportion of pebbles when pouring concrete, which saved cement and also ensured the quality of the project, saving more than 85 million yuan in April. The employees of the Steel Material Warehouse construction site made extensive use of recycled materials and waste materials without affecting the quality of the project, saving more than 770 million yuan in April.

    鞍钢基本建设部门计划降低成本一千多亿
    【新华社鞍山十六日电】鞍山钢铁公司的基本建设部门，初步订出了今年降低建设成本一千多亿元的计划。计划降低的建筑安装费用，可以新建十万三千多平方公尺带有暖气设备的住宅。
    鞍钢所属各工程公司在制订降低成本计划时，曾发动职工进行反复讨论，并接受了苏联专家的很多建议，因此各工程公司最后订出的计划都超过了鞍山钢铁公司原来提出的节约指标。筑炉工程公司制订出的节约计划，比鞍山钢铁公司提出的要求提高了百分之四。
    为了保证实现降低建设成本的计划，鞍钢各工程公司的职工都在积极提出合理化建议，从各个方面节约工程费用。轧钢工程公司职工提出的用矿渣、沥青代替轻量玻璃的建议实现以后，仅在某一个工地就能降低成本四十多亿元。职工们还提出利用改建的第三座炼铁炉工地挖出的废土做第二初轧厂工地填土的建议，不但能节省很多挖土工程费，并且还能节约很多运输费用。钢材库工地贯彻了苏联专家建议，在浇灌混凝土时多加入一定比例的石子，既节省了水泥，工程质量也很好，使四月份节约了八千五百多万元。钢材库工地的职工们，在不影响工程质量的条件下，大量地利用回收的材料和废料，在四月份节约了七亿七千多万元。
