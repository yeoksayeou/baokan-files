    The Soviet Agricultural Product Pre-Purchase System
    Kuang Ri'an
    I
    The Soviet agricultural product pre-purchase system (i.e., the contract ordering system) is a system under the leadership and supervision of the Soviet state, where state and cooperative purchasing organizations directly contract with agricultural producers before or after sowing, according to state-approved purchasing plans, to purchase agricultural products. It is what Stalin called "large-scale business conducted according to the price and quality of goods stipulated in pre-order treaties (contract orders)." [Note 1]
    In 1923-1924, the Soviet Union had already implemented a pre-purchase system for industrial crops such as cotton, sugar beets, and tobacco. However, at this time, pre-purchase was basically a commodity-based combination. By the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan in 1928, due to the large-scale existence of small-scale peasant economy, the growth rate of commodity grain production was slower than the state and people's needs for grain. The agricultural product pre-purchase system began to take the form of production combination and was systematically applied to all basic agricultural sectors, becoming the basic method of commodity circulation between urban and rural areas. In 1929, agricultural products purchased by the state through the pre-purchase system accounted for 84.1 percent of all agricultural products.
    Between the spring of 1932 and 1933, due to the complete collectivization of agriculture, the Soviet government changed the pre-purchase system for grain and important livestock products to a mandatory sales system. In 1935, important industrial crops also transitioned to a mandatory pre-purchase system with compulsory characteristics. At this point, the voluntary pre-purchase system for agricultural products finally completed its historical mission.
    II
    The role of the Soviet agricultural product pre-purchase system in the process of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization mainly includes the following aspects:
    1. The agricultural product pre-purchase system can promote agriculture to develop in a planned direction, so that the scale of agricultural production can better adapt to the needs of the state, and the scale of production of various crops can develop more proportionally. It is a means for the state to promote the specialization of various regions and improve the quality of agricultural products in a planned way according to different natural and social conditions. Stalin said at the time: "These new and universal forms of transactions between cities and villages according to the contract ordering system... are a great progress for our organizations in strengthening the planned socialist leadership of the national economy." [Note 2]
    2. The agricultural product pre-purchase system is of great significance to socialist industrialization. In the process of socialist industrialization, it is necessary to meet the growing needs of society for grain, to use domestic agricultural and livestock products as much as possible to supply the needs of industry, and in addition, to increase the export of agricultural products in order to obtain foreign exchange to import industrial machinery and equipment. Therefore, it is an important key for the state to be able to control abundant agricultural products. The agricultural product pre-purchase system is one of the basic methods for the state to purchase agricultural products according to the required varieties and quantities, and it is an important method to improve the commodity rate of agricultural production. Stalin once pointed out that this system can create a fixed relationship between the proletarian state and the peasants, so that both the state and the peasants can benefit, and that industry and agriculture are directly linked.
    3. The agricultural product pre-purchase system can not only stabilize the production mood of individual peasants and promote agricultural economic development, but also strengthen the state's leadership over individual agriculture, cut off the connection between urban and rural capitalist elements and peasants, inhibit the development of the spontaneous forces of individual peasants, and promote the transition from commodity combination to production combination between socialist industry and agriculture, thereby playing a certain role in further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and guiding peasants to take the road of collectivization. Stalin pointed out at the time: "Entering into contracts, entering into treaties with entire villages and entire townships on supplying them with seeds, etc., while at the same time ensuring that they hand over a considerable amount of grain, is the best way to increase the yield of the peasant economy and absorb peasants into the cooperative system." [Note 3] He also said: "It is necessary to universally implement the contract ordering system, establish agricultural machinery stations, and develop cooperatives as much as possible, as a bridge for the transition of individual poor and middle peasant economies to collective public farms, so that peasants can easily transfer their small individual economies to the track of collective labor... Collective farms cannot be developed, and agricultural machinery stations cannot be developed, without promoting the basic masses of peasants to collective management forms through a universal contract ordering system, and without supplying agriculture with a large number of tractors and agricultural machines, etc." [Note 4]
    III
    Compared with other agricultural product purchasing systems, the agricultural product pre-purchase system has the following characteristics: (1) State and cooperative purchasing organizations sign contracts with agricultural producers before or after sowing. (2) The contract stipulates the rules and conditions for the supplier (agricultural producer) to sell agricultural products, the type, quantity and quality of agricultural products to be sold by appointment, and the deadline for fulfilling obligations (harvesting and selling agricultural products); on the other hand, it also stipulates that the purchaser (state and cooperative purchasing organizations) purchase on time according to the stipulated price and quantity, and supply seeds, grain, means of production and other commodities in advance. In order to encourage production, it is also stipulated that suppliers can obtain progressive price increase bonuses and other methods when they hand over agricultural products according to the pre-purchase contract, especially when they hand over agricultural products exceeding the order contract. (3) The pre-purchase contract stipulates that agricultural producers who sign the contract are obliged to implement simple agricultural scientific methods, such as using improved varieties, adopting new cultivation methods and animal husbandry methods, and using new agricultural tools or agricultural machines; at the same time, purchasing agencies and relevant state departments are obliged to provide necessary assistance to pre-purchasing farmers, such as supplying improved varieties of seeds, guiding the improvement of cultivation or animal husbandry methods, assisting in improving water conservancy, and supplying or lending agricultural tools and agricultural machines, etc., to realize the production combination between urban and rural areas.
    The pre-purchase contracts are signed according to the object. State and cooperative purchasing organizations sign pre-purchase contracts with collective farms and individual farmers in accordance with the standard contracts approved by the government (farmers in the entire township and village are generally entrusted to agricultural associations or township and village soviets). At that time, the Soviet Union did not pre-purchase from rich peasants. In order to control the commodity agricultural products of rich peasants, the government stipulated certain payment tasks and forced them to implement them.
    The duration of pre-purchase contracts varies: short-term ones include quarterly contracts or annual contracts; long-term ones include several-year contracts adapted to the crop rotation system or the development of collective agriculture. Long-term contracts are generally signed only with collective farms.
    In order to consolidate and develop collective farms and guide individual peasants to embark on collectivization, at that time, collective farms not only enjoyed the right to sign long-term contracts, but also received many preferential treatments from the state in other aspects: agricultural product sales prices were higher than those of individual farmers; more advance deposits and advance commodities; priority supply of improved varieties and means of production and other priority assistance in production; preferential credit loans, etc.
    IV
    The Soviet Union's implementation of the agricultural product pre-purchase system has achieved significant results. During the period of national economic recovery, pre-purchase had already played a certain role in the recovery of light industry and agricultural industrial crop production. In 1923-1924, the sown area of industrial crops had not yet recovered to the pre-war scale, and the output was far from meeting the growing needs of light industry. The Soviet government took measures to adjust the price ratio of industrial and agricultural products, adjust the price ratio of various industrial crops and grain, and other measures, and adopted the pre-purchase system in the purchase of industrial crops to expand the sown area and output of industrial crops such as cotton. By 1927, most of the industrial crops had exceeded the pre-war sowing scale. The rapid recovery and some degree of development of the agricultural product raw material base enabled light industry to obtain certain favorable conditions for recovery and development while reducing reliance on imported agricultural product raw materials.
    The greater role of the Soviet agricultural product pre-purchase system was when it was widely adopted in the early days of the First Five-Year Plan.
    In the movement of agricultural collectivization, the pre-purchase system, combined with other agricultural collectivization measures, promoted the consolidation and development of collective farms and played a certain stimulating role in the agricultural collectivization at that time. From 1929 to 1932, collective farms developed greatly, and the proportion of their grain sown area in the total grain sown area of the country increased from 3.54 percent to 69.3 percent. The agricultural product pre-purchase system played a certain role in promoting it here.
    The Soviet government adopted the agricultural product pre-purchase system and other methods to adjust the sown area of various crops, so that the production of various crops could better adapt to the needs of the state. At that time, the state needed to produce more industrial crops to support light industry and eliminate the import of raw materials such as cotton. The pre-purchase system, combined with other measures, also played a certain role. From 1928 to 1932, cotton fields increased from more than 970,000 hectares to more than 2.17 million hectares, flax sown area increased from more than 1.73 million hectares to more than 3.15 million hectares, tobacco increased from 45,000 hectares to nearly 100,000 hectares, and sugar beets also increased from 770,000 hectares to about 1.54 million hectares. By 1932, grain fields were affected by disasters, and grain harvests were poor for two consecutive years. It was necessary to increase grain production and appropriately reduce the sown area of industrial crops. At this time, the state adjusted the sown area of grain and industrial crops through the pre-purchase of industrial crops and other measures according to the agricultural production plan. After taking the above measures, the sown area of industrial crops decreased from about 14.88 million hectares in 1932 to 10.725 million hectares in 1934, while the sown area of grain increased by about 5 million hectares in the same period, thereby increasing grain production by about 20 million metric tons. In the following years, the sown area of industrial crops stabilized at the scale of 1933, and the state only devoted itself to improving its yield per unit area. As a result, the yield per unit area of various industrial crops also increased according to the requirements of the state. It can be seen that the agricultural product pre-purchase system has played a certain role in meeting the needs of socialist industrialization for grain and raw materials, promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, helping the state adjust the scale of production of various crops, improving agricultural production, and enabling the state to control more abundant grain and agricultural product raw materials.
    V
    The Soviet Union's agricultural product pre-purchase system began to be adopted during the period of national economic recovery and developed in the process of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. It is one of the economic transition forms adopted in socialist construction. We are now in a period of transition to socialism. The contradiction between the small-scale peasant economy and socialist industry has become increasingly apparent with the progress of industrialization, and the socialist transformation of agriculture has long been on the agenda. In this case, the Soviet Union's experience in implementing agricultural product pre-purchase is basically applicable to us. However, my country's current level of industrial production, agricultural natural conditions and social conditions are different from those of the Soviet Union in 1929 when it vigorously promoted the agricultural product pre-purchase system. Therefore, it is necessary to combine it with my country's specific conditions to apply the Soviet Union's experience in agricultural product pre-purchase in order to effectively accelerate the progress of my country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization.

    苏联的农产品预购制度
    邝日安
  　一
    苏联的农产品预购制度（即定货合同制）是在苏维埃国家的领导和监督下，由国家和合作社的采购机构在播种前或收获前按照国家批准的采购计划直接向农业生产者订立合同采购农产品的制度。也就是斯大林所说：“按预订条约（定货合同）所规定的价格和货物质量进行的大批生意。”〔注一〕
    在一九二三——一九二四年，苏联已对棉花、糖萝卜、烟叶等技术作物实行预购制度，但这时的预购基本上以商品结合形态出现。及至一九二八年第一个五年计划开始，由于小农经济大量存在，商品粮食产量增长速度慢于国家和人民对粮食需要的增长速度，农产品预购制便开始采取生产结合的形式，有系统地应用于一切基本农业部门，成为城乡间商品流转的基本方法。一九二九年，国家通过预购制采购的农产品等于全部农产品的百分之八十四点一。
    在一九三二年至一九三三年春之间，由于农业已经全盘集体化了，苏联政府才将粮食和重要畜产品的预购制改为义务供售制；一九三五年，重要的技术作物也过渡到含有强制性质的义务预购制了。这时，农产品的自愿预购制度才最后完成了它的历史使命。　二
    苏联的农产品预购制度在社会主义工业化和农业集体化的过程中，所起的作用主要有下列几个方面：
    一、农产品预购制能促使农业向有计划的方向发展，使农业的生产规模较好地适应国家的需要，使各种农作物的生产规模较能按比例地发展；它是国家按照不同的自然条件与社会条件有计划地推动各地区走向专业化和提高农产品质量的手段。斯大林当时说：“城市和乡村按定货合同制来实行交易的这些新的普遍形式，……正是我们的各个组织在加强对国民经济实行有计划的社会主义的领导方面的一个极大进步”。〔注二〕
    二、农产品预购制度对社会主义工业化具有重大的意义。在社会主义工业化的过程中，必须满足社会对粮食日益增长的需要，必须尽量使用本国农、牧产品供应工业的需要，此外，为了取得外汇来输入工业机器设备，又必须增加农产品的出口，因此，国家能够掌握充裕的农产品是一个重要的关键。农产品预购制度，正是使国家能够按照所需的品种和数量采购到农产品的基本方法之一，是提高农业生产的商品率的重要方法之一。斯大林曾指出，这种制度可以在无产阶级国家和农民之间造成固定的关系，使国家与农民双方都得到利益，而且使工业和农业直接联系起来。
    三、农产品预购制不但能够稳定个体农民的生产情绪，促进农业经济发展，而且还能加强国家对个体农业的领导，割断城乡资本主义分子与农民的联系，抑制个体农民自发势力的发展，促使社会主义工业与农业从商品结合过渡到生产结合，从而对进一步巩固工农联盟，引导农民走向集体化道路等方面起一定的作用。斯大林当时指出：“订立合同，与整乡整村订立关于供给它们以种子等等，同时一定要它们交出相当数量粮食的条约，就是提高农民经济收成率和吸收农民加入合作制的最好方法。”〔注三〕又说：“必须普遍实行定货合同制，成立农业机器站，尽量发展合作社，作为个体贫农中农经济过渡到集体公共农庄的桥梁，使农民易于把他们的细小个体经济转到集体劳动轨道上来。……不经过普遍定货合同制来促使基本农民群众进到集体经营形式，不用大批拖拉机和农业机器等等来供给农业，便不能发展集体农庄，便不能发展农业机器站。”〔注四〕　三
    和其他农产品采购制度比较，农产品预购制度具有如下特点：（一）国家和合作社采购机构与农业生产者在播种前或收获前订立合同。（二）合同上规定供应者（农业生产者）出售农产品的规则和条件，预约出售的农产品的种类、数量和质量，以及完成义务（农产品的收获和交售）的期限；另一方面，也规定采购者（国家和合作社的采购机构）依照规定的价格、数量按时收购，预先供应种籽、粮食、生产资料和其他商品。为了鼓励生产，还规定供应者在按预购合同缴交农产品，特别是超出定购合同缴交农产品时，可以获得累进的加价奖金等办法。（三）预购合同中规定签立合同的农业生产者有义务实行简单的农业科学方法，如使用优良品种、采用新的耕作方法和畜牧方法，使用新式农具或农业机器等；同时，采购机关及国家有关部门有义务给予预购农户必要的帮助，如供应优良种籽，指导改进耕作或畜牧方法，协助改善水利，供应或贷予农具和农业机器等等，以实现城乡之间的生产结合。
    预购合同是分别按对象来签订的。国家和合作社采购机构，按照政府所批准的标准合同分别和集体农庄、个体农户签订预购合同（整乡整村的农户一般是委托农业协会或乡、村苏维埃代理）。苏联当时并不向富农预购，为了掌握富农的商品农产品，由政府规定一定的缴纳任务，强制其执行。
    预购合同的期限有长有短：短期的有季度合同或年度合同；长期的有适应轮作制或发展集体农业的几年合同。长期合同一般只和集体农庄签订。
    为了巩固与发展集体农庄，并引导个体农民走上集体化，当时集体农庄不仅享受签订长期合同的权利，而且在其他方面也获得国家的很多优惠：农产品出售价格高于个体农民；较多的预付定金和预付商品；优良品种及生产资料的优先供应和其他生产上的优先帮助；优惠的信用贷款等等。四
    苏联实行农产品预购制获得了重大的效果。在国民经济恢复时期，预购对轻工业与农业技术作物生产的恢复已经起了一定的作用。在一九二三—— 一九二四年，技术作物的播种面积尚未恢复到战前的规模，产量也远不能满足轻工业日益增长的需要。苏联政府就采取了调整工农产品的比价的措施，和调整各种技术作物与粮食的比价以及其他措施，并在技术作物的采购上采用预购制度等方法，来扩大棉花等技术作物的播种面积和产量。到了一九二七年，技术作物大都已经超过了战前的播种规模了。农产品原料基地的迅速恢复以及某种程度上的发展，使轻工业在减少依靠进口农产品原料的情况下，获得了恢复与发展的某些有利条件。
    苏联的农产品预购制发挥它的更大作用，还是在第一个五年计划初期被广泛采用的时候。
    在农业集体化的运动中，预购制配合其他农业集体化的措施，促进了集体农庄的巩固与发展，对当时农业集体化起了一定的刺激作用。从一九二九年到一九三二年，集体农庄得到很大发展，其谷物播种面积在全国谷物播种总面积中所占的比重由百分之三点五四增至百分之六十九点三。农产品预购制度在这里是起了一定的促进作用的。
    苏联政府采取农产品预购制及其他办法以调节各种农作物的播种面积，使各种农作物的生产更适应国家的需要。当时国家需要生产更多的技术作物来支持轻工业，杜绝棉花等原料的输入，预购制配合其他措施也起了一定的作用。从一九二八年到一九三二年，棉田从九十七万余公顷增至二百十七万余公顷，亚麻的播种面积从一百七十三万余公顷增至三百十五万余公顷，烟叶从四万五千公顷增至近十万公顷，糖萝卜也从七十七万公顷增至一百五十四万公顷左右。到了一九三二年，粮田受灾，粮食接连两年歉收，必须增加粮食生产并适当减少技术作物的播种面积，这时国家便根据农业生产计划，通过对技术作物的预购和其他措施，调节了粮食和技术作物的播种面积。在采取上述措施后，技术作物的播种面积便从一九三二年的一千四百八十八万公顷左右减至一九三四年的一千零七十二万五千公顷，而同期的粮食播种面积则增加了五百万公顷左右，从而使粮食增产了约二千万公吨。其后几年技术作物的播种面积稳定在一九三三年的规模上，国家只致力于提高它的单位面积产量，结果各种技术作物的单位面积产量也都按国家的要求提高起来了。由此可见，农产品预购制度在满足社会主义工业化对于粮食和原料的需要、促进农业的社会主义改造、帮助国家调节各种农作物的生产规模、提高农业生产和使国家掌握更充裕的粮食和农产品原料等方面，都起了一定的作用。五
    苏联的农产品预购制度是在国民经济恢复时期开始采用，并在社会主义工业化和农业集体化的过程中发展起来的。它是在社会主义建设中所采取的经济过渡形式之一。我们今天正处在过渡到社会主义的时期，小农经济和社会主义工业之间的矛盾，已随着工业化的进展而日益显露出来，农业的社会主义改造也早已提到工作日程上。在这种情况下，苏联实行农产品预购的经验对我们说来基本是适用的。不过，我国目前的工业生产水平，农业的自然条件与社会条件，和一九二九年苏联大力推广农产品预购制度时的条件有所不同，因此，必须结合我国的具体情况来运用苏联农产品预购的经验，才能有效地加速我国社会主义工业化和农业集体化的进度。
