	Moving Station and "Moving Depot"
	Qing Lijun from the Xuanhua Moving Station of the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company writes: On October 22nd of last year, our station received a notice from the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company instructing all subordinate moving stations to immediately change their names to "Moving Depot" starting November 1st. Our station held a special meeting for this purpose, and everyone believed that the moving station was an administrative management organization and did not store or stockpile goods, so changing "station" to "depot" was inappropriate. On November 17th, Wu Zhang, the deputy station master of our station, personally went to the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company to express his opinion. However, the leaders of the branch company said, "This is a unified regulation from the province." Since the higher authorities had made a decision, we had no choice but to implement it immediately, even though we had reservations. As a result, all personnel in the station had to take time out from the tense year-end summary work to change stamps, change report cards, modify report forms and ledgers, and cut stencils and print notices, etc., and finally, at the end of last year, the Xuanhua Moving Station was officially renamed "Xuanhua Moving Depot."
	On January 16th of this year, at the "Second Hebei Provincial Transportation Conference" held by the Provincial Department of Transportation, the chairman of the Xuanhua Moving Workers' Union raised his opinion on the provincial decision to rename the moving station, only to learn that the Provincial Transportation Company had not made this decision. When he asked the manager of the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company, the manager replied dissatisfiedly, "Aren't a depot and a station the same? Just let it be."
	On February 9th, the Xuanhua Moving "Depot" received another notice from the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company, requiring it to immediately restore its original name. As a result, we carried out another round of changing stamps and signs, cutting stencils and printing notices, etc., and all the newly made badges for the moving workers were scrapped. The Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company has twenty-one moving stations under its jurisdiction, all of which have suffered unnecessary losses due to repeated name changes.
	This may seem like a "small matter," but it exposes a serious flaw in the leadership of the Zhangjiakou Transportation Branch Company: making decisions rashly, not only failing to ask for instructions or report to higher authorities, not humbly considering the opinions of the masses, but also using the name of the provincial company to force subordinate units to obey.

### 搬运站和“搬运栈”

专栏：读者来信摘要

    搬运站和“搬运栈”
    张家口运输分公司宣化搬运站青丽军来信：去年十月二十二日，我站接到张家口运输分公司的一个通知，指示所属各搬运站从十一月一日起立即改名为“搬运栈”。我站为此专门召开了一次会议，大家认为搬运站是行政管理机构，并不保管或堆存货物，改“站”为“栈”不合适。十一月十七日，我站副站长吴璋亲至张家口运输分公司反映意见。但分公司领导同志说：“这是省里的统一规定。”上级既已作了决定，我们虽有意见也只能立即执行。于是，全站人员不得不在紧张进行年终总结的情况下，抽出空隙时间来进行换戳记、换报牌、修改表报账簿以及刻蜡版、印通知等工作，终于在去年年底把宣化市搬运站正式改名为“宣化市搬运栈”了。
    今年一月十六日，省交通厅召开“河北省第二届交通会议”时，宣化市搬运工会主席对省里决定搬运站改名问题提出意见，才知道省运输公司并没有此决定。当他询问张家口运输分公司经理时，经理还不满意地回答说：“栈和站还不是一样，改了就算了。”
    二月九日，宣化市搬运“栈”又收到张家口运输分公司的通知，要立即恢复原名，于是我们又进行了一次更换戳记、牌子，刻蜡版、印通知等工作，新作的搬运工人的证章又全部作废了。张家口运输分公司所辖搬运站共有二十一个，都因反复改名而造成了不应有的损失。
    这好像是件“小事”，却暴露了张家口运输分公司领导工作中的严重缺点：轻率地作出决定，不仅不向上级请示报告、不虚心考虑群众的意见，反而假借省公司的名义来强制下级单位服从。
