    The first phase of the Geneva Conference—the general debate on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the preparations for the discussion of the Indochina issue—demonstrates the failure of the United States' policy of intimidation and "big stick" both inside and outside the conference. Dulles' demands on the Korean issue were so unreasonable that, despite the pressure exerted by the United States in the meetings of the sixteen countries participating in the Korean War held frequently outside the conference, many countries were unwilling to openly express their support. Because no one wanted to speak, the conference adjourned on the 5th and 6th.

    The two-day recess has passed, but it has still not been announced which country will speak when the conference resumes on the afternoon of the 7th. Western newspapers remain cold to Dulles' speech at the conference. In the ten days since the conference began, Britain and France have not spoken. Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson spoke on May 4th, but he had to explain that he spoke because if he remained silent, he might be seen as not supporting the U.S. position.

    The general opinion—whether they have spoken or not—is that the conference on the Korean issue has not made progress precisely because the U.S. delegation has made unrealistic demands. If the United States continues to pressure countries that have not spoken to repeat U.S. demands, one cannot expect them to express any new opinions in the general debate.

    Hopes are pinned on smaller meetings held by the Soviet Union, Britain, France, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and North and South Korea, which will continue to discuss the Korean issue. The results of the first small-scale meeting on the Korean issue held last Saturday were not announced. However, judging from the fact that the U.S. spokesman expressed approval of the U.S. demands re-submitted by the Canadian and Dutch representatives on the 4th, no progress was made at that meeting.

    Even the conservative London "Times" said: "The Korean issue is not making progress because South Korea insists on their claim to hold elections only in North Korea."

    But the newspaper did not mention that Rhee Syngman's Foreign Minister merely echoed Dulles's views. In fact, the conference is not making progress because the United States is taking a stubborn attitude on other major issues.

    A tacit agreement to remain silent conceals the U.S. refusal to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea. For more than two years, the United States has avoided discussing this issue in the Korean armistice negotiations. The speeches of the foreign ministers who had to echo the U.S. position also deliberately avoided mentioning this U.S. attitude. The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that the armistice should lead to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, which is impossible if foreign troops do not withdraw from Korea.

    Contrary to the negative stance of the United States in refusing to withdraw U.S. troops and not allowing the Korean people to hold free elections without foreign interference, the constructive proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il and supported by Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai have opened the way for the relaxation of tensions and peace in Asia and the world. Accepting Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal as the basis for discussion will promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, and the way to achieve peaceful reunification is to hold free elections throughout Korea without the interference of foreign troops.

    This discussion has been hampered by the U.S. insistence on the unacceptable demand for UN supervision of Korean elections based on the illegal UN General Assembly resolution of October 1950. For four years, the people of North Korea have been denied the right to send representatives to speak at the United Nations. UN supervision means: supervision of the elections by the belligerents who have used force against the Korean people for three years without being able to conquer them. The armistice agreement signed at Panmunjom showed the world that the United States, using the UN flag, did not achieve victory on the Korean battlefield. Even British Ambassador to Washington Makins said on May 4th: "You cannot expect to achieve at the conference table what you cannot get by force."

    Another intriguing silence that shows the U.S. fear of public opinion is that U.S. newspapers have remained silent on the following suggestions by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai: interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries should cease, foreign military bases in Asian countries should be removed, foreign troops stationed in Asian countries should be withdrawn, the U.S. occupation of Taiwan should be abandoned, the revival of Japanese militarism should be prevented, and all economic blockades and restrictions should be lifted.

    The United States is also guilty of not mentioning Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal that a committee composed of representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea be formed to assist in the repatriation of the more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained (which is an act that violates the Korean Armistice Agreement and the resolutions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission), and that a joint group composed of representatives of the Red Cross Societies of the countries concerned on both sides of the Korean armistice be formed to inspect the locations where the prisoners of war are currently located.

    The reason why the United States remains silent is that Dulles has openly stated his intention to continue to exert pressure to intensify interference in Indochina, expand the war, and turn the country into another Korea. News from the United States and Western newspapers that if the Geneva Conference fails, Dulles will have more capital to put together a U.S.-dominated Southeast Asian aggressive bloc makes it clear why the United States is making uncompromising and unrealistic demands at the Geneva Conference.

    However, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's call for maintaining peace in Asia has been echoed around the world. The communique of the Colombo Conference of the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan called for a speedy end to the Indochina war and the restoration of peace. They also said that the continued existence of colonialism in the world is a violation of basic human rights and a threat to world peace.

    If a conclusion can be drawn from the Geneva Conference in the past ten days, this conclusion is: this important international conference discussing Asian issues proves that no decision can be made on the future of Asian countries without the agreement of Asian countries. The era in which imperialist countries could unilaterally decide the fate of Asia is gone forever.

### 十天以来的日内瓦会议

    十天以来的日内瓦会议
    新华社记者　沈建图
    日内瓦会议的第一阶段——关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一般辩论和安排印度支那问题的讨论的准备工作——表明美国在会议内外实行的恫吓和“大棒”政策已告失败。杜勒斯在朝鲜问题上所提的要求是这样蛮不讲理，因而尽管美国在会外时常举行的参加朝鲜战争的十六个国家的会议中施用压力，许多国家还是不愿公开表示支持他。由于没有人要发言，会议在五日和六日宣告休会。
    两天的休会时间过去了，可是仍然没有宣布在七日下午会议复会时有哪个国家发言。西方报纸对杜勒斯在会上的发言仍然很冷淡。在会议开始后的十天中，英国和法国一直没有发言。加拿大外交部长皮尔逊在五月四日作了发言，可是他不得不解释说，他之所以发言，是因为要是他再保持沉默，他也许会被认为不支持美国的立场。
    一般的意见——不管是否发了言——是这样的：正因为美国代表团提出不切实际的要求使得讨论朝鲜问题的会议得不到进展。如果美国继续逼迫没有发言的国家重复提出美国的要求，人们不能指望他们在一般辩论中发表什么新意见。
    人们把希望寄托在由苏、英、法、美、中华人民共和国及北朝鲜和南朝鲜举行的规模较小的会议上，这些会议将继续讨论朝鲜问题。上星期六举行的讨论朝鲜问题的第一次小规模会议的结果没有宣布。但是从美国发言人表示赞同加拿大和荷兰代表四日重新提出的美国要求这一点看来，那次会议上没有得到进展。
    甚至保守的伦敦“泰晤士报”也这样说：“朝鲜问题得不到进展，是因为南朝鲜坚持他们的主张，要只是在北朝鲜进行选举。”
    但是该报没有提到李承晚的外务部长官只是附和杜勒斯的主张。事实上，会议之所以得不到进展，是因为美国在其他主要问题上采取顽固态度的缘故。
    互相约定闭口不谈的默契掩盖了美国拒绝一切外国军队自朝鲜撤退的态度。有两年多的时间，美国在朝鲜停战谈判中一直避不讨论这个问题。不得不附和美国的主张的外长们的发言也故意不提到美国的这种态度。朝鲜停战协定规定，停战应导向朝鲜问题的和平解决，而要是外国军队不从朝鲜撤退，这是不可能实现的。
    和美国拒绝撤退美国军队并不让朝鲜人民在不受外国干涉的情况下进行自由的选举的这种消极立场相反，南日外务相所提出并得到莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长支持的建设性建议，已为亚洲和全世界的紧张局势的缓和与和平开辟了道路。接受南日外务相的建议作为讨论的基础，将促成朝鲜的和平统一，而实现和平统一的方法就是举行不受外国军队干涉的全朝鲜自由选举。
    由于美国坚持根据联合国大会一九五零年十月的非法决议由联合国监督朝鲜选举的不能接受的要求，这种讨论受到了阻碍。四年以来，北朝鲜人民被拒绝了派遣代表到联合国发言的权利。联合国监督意味着：由对朝鲜人民施用了三年的武力都没有能征服他们的交战国来监督选举。在板门店签订的停战协定向全世界表明：利用联合国旗帜的美国没有在朝鲜战场上取得胜利。甚至连英国驻华盛顿大使麦金斯在五月四日也说：“你不能希望在会议桌上取得你用武力得不到的东西。”
    另一个表明美国害怕舆论的耐人寻味的缄默就是，美国报纸对周恩来外长的下面这些建议保持沉默：对亚洲各国内政的干涉应该停止，在亚洲各国的外国军事基地应该撤除，驻在亚洲各国的外国军队应该撤退，美国对台湾的占领应该放弃，日本军国主义的复活应该防止，一切经济封锁和限制应该取消。
    美国也做贼心虚地不提周恩来外长的关于由美国、联合王国、法国、中华人民共和国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的代表组成委员会，以协助遣返被强迫扣留（这是破坏朝鲜停战协定和中立国遣返委员会的决议的行为）的四万八千余名朝中被俘人员的建议，以及在这之前由朝鲜停战缔约双方有关国家的红十字会代表组成联合小组前往战俘现在所在地点进行视察的建议。
    美国之所以保持沉默，就是因为杜勒斯曾公开表示打算继续施加压力来加紧干涉印度支那，扩大战争并把这个国家变成另一个朝鲜。美国和西方报纸的消息说，如果日内瓦会议失败了，杜勒斯拼凑美国支配下的东南亚侵略集团的资本就多些了，从这些消息就可以明了美国在日内瓦会议上提出不让步的、不现实的要求的原因。
    但是，周恩来外长所发出的维护亚洲和平的呼吁已经得到了全世界各地的响应。缅甸、锡兰、印度、印尼和巴基斯坦五国总理科伦坡会议的公报要求迅速结束印度支那战争，恢复和平。他们并说，殖民主义在世界上的继续存在是违反人类的基本权利的，对于世界和平是一种威胁。
    如果可以作出十天以来的日内瓦会议的结论的话，这个结论就是：这个讨论亚洲问题的重要国际会议证明，没有亚洲各国的协议，是不能作出有关亚洲各国的前途的决定的。帝国主义国家可以片面地决定亚洲命运的时代已经一去不复返了。
