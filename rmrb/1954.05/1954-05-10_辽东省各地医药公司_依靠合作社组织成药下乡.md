    Liaoning Province Pharmaceutical Companies
    Rely on Cooperatives to Organize the Distribution of Medicines to Rural Areas
    Pharmaceutical companies in various parts of Liaoning Province are promptly supplying farmers with various prepared medicines through supply and marketing cooperatives. Pharmaceutical companies in various localities have also provided specific assistance to the cooperatives. Last winter, the Liaoyuan City Pharmaceutical Company and the County Cooperative jointly ran short-term pharmaceutical training classes and sent cadres to the cooperative to provide specific assistance; at the same time, they organized sales teams to guide cooperatives in various places to develop their business. The Liaoning Provincial Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation compiled various rural medicine instruction manuals, explaining the properties of the medicines, the diseases they mainly treat, the dosage, and the method of administration, and distributed them to cooperatives in various places; it also held pharmaceutical training classes with the Provincial Cooperative, enabling the salespersons of various grassroots cooperatives to understand basic medical knowledge.

    辽东省各地医药公司
    依靠合作社组织成药下乡
    辽东省各地医药公司通过供销合作社及时供应农民各种成药。各地医药公司并对合作社进行了具体帮助。去年冬天，辽源市医药公司与县合作社开办了短期医药训练班，又派干部到合作社具体进行帮助；同时组织推销组到各地指导合作社开展业务。中国医药公司辽东省公司编印了各种农村用药说明书，说明药性、主治病症、用量、服法等，分发给各地合作社；又与省合作社举办了医药训练班，使各基层社的营业员懂得普通的医药知识。　　（雁青）
