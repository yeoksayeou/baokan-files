The number of translated and published Soviet books in China is increasing rapidly. The revolutionary theories of Lenin and Stalin, the theory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the latest achievements of Soviet academic culture, and the advanced experiences of industrial and agricultural production and construction are being introduced to China in large quantities. According to incomplete statistics, from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the end of 1953, 5,183 kinds of Soviet books have been translated and published in China. The proportion of Soviet books in the total number of translated books in China has been increasing year by year: from October 1949 to December 1950, it accounted for 64.1 percent of the total number of translated books, 77.2 percent in 1951, 79.3 percent in 1952, and 87.1 percent in 1953. This fully reflects the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in learning the most advanced socialist culture of mankind.

Among the Soviet books translated and published in China, the works of Lenin and Stalin occupy the most important position. Since liberation to the end of 1953, a total of 108 kinds have been published, with more than 12 million copies printed. Since 1953, the publication of "The Complete Works of Stalin," with an initial print run of one million copies per volume, has set a new record for the large-scale printing of Marxist-Leninist classics in China, marking a new period for the Chinese people to further study the theories of Lenin and Stalin. At the same time, due to the upsurge of the national movement to study the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the documents of the Soviet Party and other works of the Soviet leaders have also been published in greater quantities. For example, Malenkov's "Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress" was printed in more than 1.8 million copies.

Secondly, a large number of theoretical books aimed at elucidating the economic foundation and state system of Soviet socialism, and various works introducing the development of Soviet society, have been published. After the successive publication of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, central-level publishing houses in China, led by the People's Publishing House, publish hundreds of kinds of works selected and translated from this treasure house of human knowledge every year. In addition, specialized works on the Soviet Constitution and its various legislations, Soviet finance, state budget, national income, banking and credit system, domestic and foreign trade, the organization and management of various departments of Soviet industry, the system of state farms and collective farms, and national economic planning have also been widely published.

After China entered the period of planned construction, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in learning advanced Soviet science and technology knowledge has increased significantly. Therefore, the publication volume of Soviet natural science and production technology books has greatly increased. Among the 1,837 kinds of Soviet books translated and published in 1953, books in this area accounted for 528 kinds. The complete works and selected works of great Soviet scientists such as Pavlov, Michurin, Lysenko, Vavilov, and Mendeleev are being translated and published successively. The multi-volume "Encyclopedia of Machine Manufacturing" is being selected and published in separate volumes. Books on "Rapid Steelmaking," "High-Speed Cutting," "Rapid Excavation Method of Soviet Coal Mines," and other books describing the Stakhanovite work method, various works on geological exploration and basic construction technical operations, as well as books on advanced agricultural and animal husbandry production experience, and advanced medical work experience have been published in large quantities. In 1953, under the organization and guidance of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, 277 kinds of textbooks from Soviet universities and specialized schools were published, which made the teaching content of our universities and secondary vocational schools焕然一新 (completely new), which is a major event in our cultural and educational construction.

Soviet literary books with high ideological content and excellent artistic skills have had the most profound impact on Chinese readers. By the end of 1953, 84 Soviet literary works that had won Stalin Prizes had been translated, published and revised and republished in China. Among them, the number of copies issued for more than 100,000 copies includes "Days and Nights", "Ordinary Soldier", "A Real Man", "Hero of the Golden Star", "Harvest", "Happiness", "It's Already Morning Here", "Three People in Gray Coats", "Far From Moscow", etc. In addition, the number of copies of "How Steel Was Tempered" and "Gulia's Road" reached more than 700,000 copies, and the number of copies of "The Story of Zoya and Shura" reached more than 1.28 million copies. The Soviet people's love for the motherland, love for labor, love for life, perseverance and self-sacrificing communist spirit described in these works profoundly educated the working people of our country, encouraging them to overcome difficulties and forge ahead in the cause of building their motherland.

    苏联书籍在我国翻译出版数量飞速增长
    苏联书籍在我国的翻译出版数量，正在飞速地增加。列宁斯大林的革命学说，苏联建设社会主义的理论，苏联学术文化的最新成就和工农业生产建设的先进经验，被大量地介绍到中国来。根据不完全的统计，从中华人民共和国成立起到一九五三年年底止，我国翻译出版的苏联书籍已达五千一百八十三种。苏联书籍在我国全部翻译书籍中所占的比重逐年增长：一九四九年十月至一九五○年十二月占全部翻译书籍种类百分之六十四点一，一九五一年占百分之七十七点二，一九五二年占百分之七十九点三，一九五三年则占了百分之八十七点一。这充分反映了中国人民学习人类最先进的社会主义文化的热情。
    在我国翻译出版的苏联书籍中，列宁和斯大林的著作，占着最重要的地位。解放以来至一九五三年底，共出版了一百零八种，印行了一千二百多万册。从一九五三年起，每卷初版印数达一百万册的“斯大林全集”的出版，开创了我国大量印行马克思列宁主义经典著作的新纪录，标志着我国人民进一步学习列宁斯大林学说的新时期。同时由于全国学习苏联共产党历史运动的高涨，苏联党的文献和苏共领袖们的其他著作，也有了更大量的出版，马林科夫“在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”，就印行了一百八十多万册。
    其次是大量出版了以阐明苏联社会主义的经济基础、国家制度为目的的理论书籍和介绍苏维埃社会发展情况的各方面著作。在苏联大百科全书陆续出版后，我国中央一级出版社，以人民出版社为首，每年出版着上百种的从这个人类知识宝库选译出来的各种著作。此外，论述苏联宪法及其各项立法、苏联财政、国家预算、国民收入、银行与信贷制度，国内贸易与对外贸易、苏联工业各部门的组织和管理、国营农庄与集体农庄制度，以及国民经济计划等等的专门著作都有了广泛的出版。
    在我国进入有计划建设时期后，广大人民学习苏联先进科学技术知识的积极性显著地高涨，因此，苏联自然科学和生产技术书籍的出版量大增。一九五三年翻译出版的一千八百三十七种苏联书籍中，这方面的书籍就占了五百二十八种。苏联伟大科学家如巴甫洛夫、米丘林、李森科、瓦维洛夫、孟节立叶夫等人的全集，和选集，正在陆续翻译出版；多卷头的“机器制造百科全书”正在选译分册出版，“快速炼钢”、“高速切削”、“苏联煤矿的快速掘进法”及其他叙述斯达哈诺夫式工作方法的书籍，各种地质勘探和基本建设技术作业的著作，以至农业、畜牧业先进生产经验、医学先进工作经验等书籍都有了大量的出版。一九五三年中，在中央人民政府高等教育部的组织和指导下，出版了二百七十七种苏联高等学校和专科学校的教材，使我国的高等学校和中等专业学校的教学内容得以焕然一新，这是我国文教建设上的一个重大事件。
    在我国读者中产生着最深远影响的，是具有高度思想性与卓越的艺术技巧的苏联文艺书籍。至一九五三年年底止，我国翻译出版和修订重版的获得斯大林奖金的苏联文艺作品已达八十四种。其中发行数量在十万册以上的有“日日夜夜”、“普通一兵”、“真正的人”、“金星英雄”、“收获”、
  “幸福”、“我们这里已是早晨”、“三个穿灰大衣的人”、“远离莫斯科的地方”等书。此外，
  “钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“古丽雅的道路”两书发行数量达到七十万册以上，“卓娅和舒拉的故事”发行了一百二十八万多册。这些著作所描述的苏维埃人民的热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱生活、坚毅奋斗和自我牺牲的共产主义精神，深刻地教育了我国劳动人民，鼓舞着他们在建设自己祖国的事业中克服困难，奋勇前进。
