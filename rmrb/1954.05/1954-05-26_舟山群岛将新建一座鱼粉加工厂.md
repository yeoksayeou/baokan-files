A large-scale, modern fishmeal processing plant is to be built in the famous Zhoushan Archipelago fishing area.

The Zhoushan Archipelago produces millions of dan of various fish annually, supplying them to all parts of the country. However, due to the limitations of local processing and transportation conditions, a considerable amount of fish is still left to rot on the beaches every year, affecting the income of fishermen. After the fishmeal processing plant is established, it will be able to process 250,000 jin of fish per day, which will play a significant role in developing Zhoushan's fisheries and improving the lives of fishermen. It is estimated that the output of cuttlefish alone can be doubled. Fishmeal is a nutritious food and feed. Grade A fishmeal can be used for human consumption, while Grade B fishmeal can be used as feed, promoting rapid growth in chickens, ducks, and livestock. It can also be exported to foreign countries in exchange for industrial equipment, supporting the country's economic construction. Fish oil, a byproduct of fishmeal, is also a raw material used in the manufacture of rubber, leather, and paint.

This modern fishmeal processing plant will have dozens of dryers, oil presses, grinders, and an attached power plant. All production processes will be connected by automated conveyor belts. Various types of fish caught by fishermen from the sea will be sent to the factory, and in two and a half hours, they will be transformed into fragrant and fine fishmeal.

Currently, the fishmeal processing plant is undergoing intense construction preparations. It is expected that full-scale construction will begin in July, and partial production can begin in the fourth quarter of this year.

    舟山群岛将新建一座鱼粉加工厂
    著名的舟山群岛鱼产区，将要兴建一座规模巨大的现代化鱼粉加工厂。
    舟山群岛每年生产数百万担各种鱼类，供应全国各地，但是由于当地加工和运输条件的限制，每年还有不少鱼被抛在海滩上烂掉，影响了渔民的收入。鱼粉加工厂建立以后，一天就能加工二十五万斤鱼，对发展舟山渔业和改善渔民生活，将起重大作用，预计仅墨鱼的产量即可增加一倍。鱼粉是一种营养丰富的食物和饲料，甲级鱼粉可供食用；乙级鱼粉可供饲料，鸡、鸭、牲畜吃了以后生长很快；还可输出国外换回工业器材，支援国家的经济建设。鱼粉的副产品鱼油，也是制造橡胶、皮革、油漆要用的原料。
    这座现代化鱼粉加工厂有几十部蒸干机、榨油机、磨粉机和一个附属的电力厂，所有生产工序都由自动化传送带连接起来。渔民从海里捕起来的各种鱼类送进工厂，经过两个半钟点就变成了又香又细的鱼粉。
    目前鱼粉加工厂正在紧张地进行施工准备，预计七月份起将全面施工，今年第四季度就可以开始局部生产。
