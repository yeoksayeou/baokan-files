Henan Mountainous Area Leading Organs Should Value Forest Protection Work

The leading organs in many mountainous areas of Henan Province neglect forest protection work, resulting in continuous forest fires and great losses. In one month, from early March to early April, Nanyang Prefecture, located at the foot of the Funiu Mountains, experienced 75 forest fires, destroying 3.7 million trees. In Tongbai County, 16 forest fires occurred in half a month, destroying more than 1.6 million trees, exceeding the county's spring afforestation task by 95 times. In Luoning County, Luoyang Prefecture, there were 33 consecutive fires. The masses in Hugou Township of the county painfully said, looking at the large areas of forest that had been burned down: the leadership has not made any arrangements for forest protection work at all. In Shangcheng, Luoshan and other counties located at the foot of the Dabie Mountains, the leading organs have taken effective measures for forest protection, and immediately led the masses to put out forest fires when they were discovered, greatly arousing the enthusiasm of the masses for forest protection. The leading organs in the mountainous areas of the province should immediately attach importance to forest protection work. (Lü Jianzhong)

    河南省山区领导机关应重视护林工作
    河南省不少山区领导机关忽视护林工作，致不断造成山林火灾，损失很大。三月上旬至四月上旬的一个月中，位于伏牛山麓的南阳专区就发生过山火七十五次，烧毁林木三百七十万株；桐柏县半个月内也发生山火十六次，毁林木一百六十余万株，超过该县今春造林任务九十五倍。洛阳专区洛宁县连续发生火灾三十三次。该县虎沟乡群众望着焚毁的大片林木痛心地说：领导上对护林工作根本就没有布置过。位于大别山麓的商城、罗山等县由于领导机关对护林采取有效措施，发现山火立即领导群众扑灭，大大发挥了群众护林的积极性。该省山区领导机关对护林工作应立即重视起来。（吕建中）
