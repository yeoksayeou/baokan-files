To the Comrades of the Sixth General Sub-Delegation of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, beloved people of the Motherland:

	It has been over five months since we parted. In these five months, we have been constantly thinking of you, and we have never forgotten your kind instructions and expectations.

	You remember, don't you, when you came to the Kinmen frontline, the artillery fire in Korea had only just ceased, and this place was still a scene of ashes, the fields were overgrown with weeds more than a man tall, and everywhere were mines laid in advance by the enemy… But now, everything has changed. In the area from near Shangganling in the west to the North Han River in the east, we have helped the Korean people build 28 new villages, large and small, and 1,477 new houses. Together with the houses built by the Korean people themselves, nearly a thousand households of Korean people who have returned to their homes have moved into new residences in their hometowns. During the war, as you know, the schools here were destroyed by the enemy; but now, a middle school and two elementary school buildings have been rebuilt.

	On April 8th, the Korean children had their first lesson in the new classrooms. The teacher gave the students the following composition topic: "Thank you, Chinese People's Volunteers." Not only the students, but even the teachers wrote articles. They also specially collected a lot of azaleas and sent them to us along with these articles. Every sentence in the articles and every flower collected represents the hearts of the Korean people and contains the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. In addition, we have helped the Korean people repair 13 irrigation canals with a total length of more than 11,000 meters. The water of the Kinmen River has flowed into these canals, irrigating more than one million pyeong of farmland. Now, the Korean farmers are responding to the call of "not leaving an inch of land uncultivated" and have begun spring ploughing. The tractors of the Kinmen Farm have ploughed the land that has been barren for many years, and some have already been sown. It is expected that the first great harvest after the armistice will appear on the Kinmen frontline in a few months!

	Dear people: When it comes to helping the Korean people restore and rebuild, the soldiers are so excited! The soldiers say: We will not only use our blood to seize this land and defend this land, but also use our sweat to help the Korean people rebuild their homes and create a happy life on this land! In early March, the leading organs of the troops and the local Korean government established a command organization for rebuilding homes, formed dozens of "Helping the Korean People's Construction Teams," and many carpentry teams, ironworking teams, transportation teams, masonry teams, and more than a dozen mine-sweeping teams, and, just like when we launched a counterattack against the enemy here last summer, they threw themselves into the battle of construction with a hundredfold spirit!

	When building houses, the soldiers overcame numerous difficulties such as the lack of materials, the lack of experience in building Korean houses, and the severe cold weather. They invited the Korean people to be "engineers," solicited the opinions of the homeowners, and carefully studied the plans. The soldiers' goal was "four satisfactions": homeowner satisfaction, local government satisfaction, superior's satisfaction, and self-satisfaction; to ensure that the houses are built sturdily, warmly, beautifully, and in accordance with the habits and requirements of the Korean people. In those days, when you passed by the Chuxi-ri Road, you could hear the clanging sounds coming from the nearby jungle. This was the iron furnace built by the soldiers in three days. When the iron furnace was first established, there was only an anvil made of a shell casing and charcoal dust left over from winter, and the rest had to be found everywhere. In order to ensure the timely supply of construction tools, the soldiers of the ironworking team overcame many difficulties and completed their tasks. One night, soldier Li Shoukun had a high fever and couldn't help groaning in bed. Fearing that the squad leader would hear him and not call him to work the next day, he covered his head and slept all night, and the next day he climbed more than 700 meters of high mountain to pick up a lot of scrap iron. In this way, the carpenters got axes and chisels from them, and the masons got trowels from them. Iron nails, screws... were all sent to the construction site from here. In order to build the Kinmen Middle School solidly and beautifully, the soldiers dug out large stone strips from the ruins to build the foundations, and found bricks everywhere to build the walls. Since there were no tiles, they used thin slate to replace them. When soldier Ding Siyun climbed onto the roof to dismantle the temporary houses built after the armistice, a crossbeam broke, and he fell down, and then the collapsed stones and tiles hit him, his right hand bleeding. The comrades quickly helped him up, bandaged his wound, and advised him to rest. But when he thought of the lovely Korean children who would be studying here, he forgot the pain and climbed back onto the roof to continue his work!

	Repairing dams and canals was an arduous task. When repairing the Kinmen River Dam, the soldiers were standing in the just-thawed water to work; digging the Beishan Canal in Bieyang-ri required blasting three mountain mouths flat... However, while working, the soldiers also sang: "Snowflakes are falling, the wind is howling, the comrades feel warm in their hearts, the shovels and picks go up and down on the construction site... Strive to repair the canal ahead of schedule, so that this land will be full of crops and flowers!"

	Dear comrades, you know that the enemy had buried tens of thousands of mines in this area when they fled in a panic, and the cunning enemy also made the mine wires the same color as the grass, attempting to continue to kill and injure the Korean people. However, since we can liberate this land, we have the full courage to remove the mines that the enemy has ambushed here. The heroic soldiers Xia Yin-feng and other four comrades gloriously gave their most precious lives while clearing mines. The local Korean people held a memorial service for them, and all the officers and soldiers turned their grief into strength. Cao Xiliang, the chief of staff of a certain unit, personally led the mine-sweeping team to set off. When the local Korean people learned of this, they were very moved. Our soldiers deeply know that creating happiness requires paying a price, but they also know that the prosperity and consolidation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is conducive to the thorough resolution of the Korean issue and to the economic construction of the motherland!

	Dear comrades, dear families, the lives of the people in northern Korea after the armistice are improving and rising day by day; while the fate of the people in southern Korea is becoming more and more tragic. Just opposite the Kinmen frontline, 30 kilometers south of the demilitarized zone in the area ruled by the enemy, there is not a single civilian. And the US-Li bandits in the southern part of the demilitarized zone frequently violate the armistice agreement. However, our eyes are sharp, and we can see clearly every move of the enemy. If they dare to take another risk, we guarantee to wipe them out here!

    金城前线变样了
    高烽
    亲爱的祖国人民第三届赴朝慰问团第六总分团的同志们：
    分别已经五个多月了。五个多月中，我们无时无刻不在怀念着你们，更从来没有忘掉你们亲切的嘱托和期望。
    你们还记得吧，你们到金城前线来时，朝鲜的炮火才停息不久，这里还是一片灰烬，田野里长着一人多深的野草，到处是敌人事先埋藏的地雷……。可是现在呢，一切都变了。在西起上甘岭附近，东到北汉江的一片土地上，我们帮助朝鲜人民修建了大小二十八个新村，盖了一千四百七十七间新房，连同朝鲜人民自己盖的房子，近千户重返家园的朝鲜人民都搬进了故乡的新居。战争期间，你们也是知道的，这里的学校都被敌人毁坏了；而现在，一所中学和两所小学的校舍又重新矗立了起来。
    四月八日，朝鲜的孩子们在新的教室里上了第一堂课，老师给学生们出了这样一个作文题目：“感谢中国人民志愿军”。不光是学生，就连老师也都写了文章。他们还特意采集了很多金达莱花，和这些文章一并送给我们了。文章的每一句话和采来的每一朵花，都代表着朝鲜人民的心，都蕴藏着中朝人民的深厚友谊。另外，我们还帮助朝鲜人民修好了全长一万一千多公尺的十三条水渠，金城川的水已经流进了这些水渠，灌溉着一百多万坪田地。现在，朝鲜农民都响应了“不荒一寸土地”的号召，开始春耕了。金城农场的拖拉机已经把荒芜了多年的土地翻耕过来，有的都下了种。预计停战后的第一个大丰收，几个月以后就会在金城前线出现！
    亲爱的人们：提起帮助朝鲜人民恢复和建设，战士们是多么兴奋啊！战士们说：我们不光是用自己的鲜血夺取这块土地，保卫这块土地，还要用自己的汗来帮助朝鲜人民在这块土地上重建家园，创造幸福的生活！三月初，部队领导机关和当地朝鲜政府成立了重建家园的指挥机构，组成了数十个“帮助朝鲜人民建设队”，和许多木工组、铁工组、运输组、泥工组以及十多个扫雷队，好像去年夏季我们在这里向敌人发动反击一样，精神百倍地投入了建设的战斗！
    在修建房子时，战士们克服了材料缺乏、没有盖朝鲜房子的经验、气候严寒等重重困难。他们请朝鲜人民当“工程师”，征求房主的意见，精心地研究计划。战士们的奋斗目标是“四满意”：房主满意，当地政府满意，上级满意和自己满意；保证房子盖得坚固、保暖、美观，还要适合朝鲜人民的习惯和要求。那几天，当你从初西里公路经过时，便可以听到从路旁丛林里传出来的叮叮当当的声音。这是战士们在三天内修建起来的铁工炉。铁工炉刚建立时，只有一个用炮弹头做成的砧子和冬天剩下来的木炭末子，其余的都得到处去找。为了保证及时供给修建工具，铁工组的战士们就战胜了很多困难，完成了自己的任务。有一天晚上战士李寿昆发高烧，躺在床上忍不住直呻吟，他怕班长听到了第二天不叫他去干活，就蒙住头睡了一夜，第二天又爬了七百多公尺的高山去拣了很多废铁。就这样，木工从他们这里得到了斧子和凿子，泥工从他们这里得到了泥抹子。铁钉、螺丝……都从这里源源送到了工地。为了把金城中学盖得结实和美观，战士们从废墟中刨出来大石条来垒墙脚，到处找砖来砌墙，没有瓦，就用薄石板来代替。战士丁思云爬上房顶去拆停战后临时盖起来的房子时，一根横木断了，摔了下来，接着塌下来的石头、瓦片砸在他的身上，右手砸得流血了。同志们赶快把他扶起来，替他包好了伤口，并劝他去休息。可是当他想到那些可爱的朝鲜孩子就要在这里读书时，又忘记了疼痛，重新爬上了房顶，继续自己的工作！
    修水坝和水渠是一件很艰苦的工作。修金城川水坝时，战士们都站在刚解冻的水里工作；挖别洋里北山的水渠，需要把三个山嘴炸平……。可是，战士们一边干活，一边还唱着：“雪花纷纷下，大风呼呼刮，同志们心里暖烘烘，工地上锹镐上上下下。……争取提前修好水渠，让这块土地上长满庄稼，开满鲜花！”
    亲爱的同志们，你们是知道的，这个地区敌人在狼狈逃窜时曾埋下了数以万计的地雷，狡猾的敌人还把雷线弄成了和草一样的颜色，企图借此来继续杀伤朝鲜人民。可是，我们既然能解放这块土地，就完全有勇气来排除敌人在这里埋伏的地雷。英雄的战士夏荫凤等四位同志，在扫雷时光荣地献出了自己最宝贵的生命。当地朝鲜人民曾为他们开了追悼会，全体指战员都把悲愤化为力量。某部参谋长曹锡亮亲自带着扫雷队出发了。当地朝鲜人民知道了这件事，都非常感动。我们的战士深知道创造幸福是要付出代价的，但是他们更知道朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的繁荣和巩固，有利于朝鲜问题的彻底解决，有利于祖国人民的经济建设！
    亲爱的同志们，亲人们，停战后朝鲜北部人民的生活就是这样一天天地改善着，上升着；而朝鲜南部人民的遭遇却越来越悲惨了。就在金城前线的对面，离非军事区南沿三十公里敌人统治的地方，还没有一家老百姓呀。而非军事区南沿的美李匪军，经常违反停战协定。可是，我们的眼睛是雪亮的，敌人的一举一动我们都看得清清楚楚，他们要敢再来冒险，我们保证能把他们消灭在这里！
