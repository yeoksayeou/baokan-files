The wheat harvest season is approaching, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province are actively preparing supplies for the wheat harvest period. Some areas have already begun supplying wheat harvesting farm tools. Currently, the provincial wholesale station of Hebei Province Cooperatives has organized more than twenty local industrial and handicraft industries, such as ceramics, knitting, clothing, bamboo and linen goods, and food processing, to produce a large number of products, with a total value of 298.1 billion yuan. At the same time, it has sent cadres to East China, Central South China, Northwest China and other places to purchase a batch of summer goods such as cool mats, palm fans, and umbrellas, worth more than 30 billion yuan. The county cooperative unions have actively signed large industrial product supply contracts and agreements with local state-owned companies such as department stores and cotton yarn and cloth companies, and organized grassroots cooperatives to purchase goods.

In terms of production materials, cooperative at all levels in Hebei Province have prepared more than 120 million jin of commercial fertilizer, more than 2.2 million pieces of small farm tools, 3,100 head of livestock, and more than 3 million jin of pesticides, ready to supply farmers before and after the wheat harvest.

Grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province have also actively prepared supplies for the wheat harvest period. The supply plan of grassroots cooperatives in Tangshan Special District during the wheat harvest period reached 255 billion yuan, and more than 80% of the goods have reliable sources of supply, of which production materials reached 75.4% of the original plan, and living materials reached 93.7% of the original plan.

Some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have transported goods to grassroots sales units in advance and started supplying them. The Yutian County Cooperative Union purchased 80,000 jin of bamboo broom seedlings in April and promptly organized a group of handicraft workers to process them, which can produce about 16,000 brooms. Together with the 2,300 brooms purchased from other districts, the supply increased fivefold compared to last year. The cooperative also ordered 2,000 wooden forks from the local wood production cooperative, which have been promptly transferred to the grassroots cooperatives. The Chengguan District Cooperative of the county sold 268 brooms and 40 wooden forks in eight days. Some farmers in Wuzhuang Village said with satisfaction: "The cooperative is so thoughtful, the brooms are here before the wheat harvest!" (Lü Guiyuan, Zhang Qinglin)

The Xingping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaanxi Province is cooperating with the summer harvest preparation work and vigorously supplying agricultural tools. It has now sold 28 kinds of agricultural tools, 127,300 pieces. It is estimated that the value of agricultural tools supplied before the summer harvest will be nine times that of the same period last year.

This supply and marketing cooperative relies on grassroots cooperatives to organize local handicraftsmen to use local materials and local processing to meet farmers' needs for production materials. Last year, only two units of the supply and marketing cooperative placed small orders. This year, all eight grassroots cooperatives in the county, together with the county union, organized 39 groups of handicraft workers, including wood, leather, bamboo, and iron, to process diverse production materials. In addition to providing handicraft workers with high-quality raw materials in a timely manner, verifying costs, supervising production, and accepting goods according to specifications, the supply and marketing cooperative also regularly conducts political and ideological education for handicraftsmen, explaining the significance of producing agricultural tools for agricultural production, and requiring that agricultural tools be strong, durable, cheap, and timely. At present, the sales volume of nine kinds of agricultural tools, such as iron harrows, carrying baskets, and cowhide covers, has exceeded the original planned number. The prices of larger agricultural tools are 3,000 to 10,000 yuan lower than the market price. For example, each carrying basket produced uses two more "jing" of bamboo than private businesses, with a density of 110 bamboo strips per basket, while the unit price is only 14,000 yuan, which is 3,000 to 4,000 yuan cheaper than the market. The masses said that the carts sold by the supply and marketing cooperative are so sturdy that "even if you call a carpenter to your home to make them, you can't guarantee that they can be made so strong."

The supply and marketing cooperative also organizes carpenters to go to the countryside to repair old agricultural tools. According to statistics, from April 10th to May 10th this year, 78 carts have been repaired for farmers in 30 days.

After last year's rectification and this year's study of the general line, the Xingping Supply and Marketing Cooperative clarified its operating ideology, established a production materials supply organization, and leading cadres personally understood the market situation and organized the supply, which has greatly improved this year's supply work.

    河北省供销合作社供应麦收农具
    陕西省兴平县配合夏收准备大力供应生产资料
    麦收季节即将到来，河北省各地供销合作社积极准备麦收期间供应的物资，部分地区已经开始供应麦收农具。目前，河北省合作社省级批发站已组织陶瓷、针织、服装、竹麻货、副食加工等二十多个行业的地方工业和手工业生产了大批产品，总值二千九百八十一亿元；同时派出干部，分赴华东、中南、西北等地采购了凉席、葵扇、雨伞等一批夏令货，共值三百余亿元。各县合作社联合社都积极和当地百货、花纱布等各国营公司签订了大批工业品供应合同和协议，组织基层合作社进货。
    在生产资料方面，河北省各级合作社已备妥商品肥料一亿二千多万斤、小型农具二百二十余万件、牲畜三千一百头、农药三百多万斤，准备在麦收前后供应农民。
    河北省各地基层供销合作社，也都积极准备了麦收期间供应的物资。唐山专区全区基层合作社麦收期间的供应计划达二千五百五十亿元，百分之八十以上的货物已有了可靠的货源，其中生产资料达原计划的百分之七十五点四，生活资料达原计划的百分之九十三点七。
    有些地区的供销合作社已经把货物提前运到基层销售单位，开始供应。玉田县合作社联合社在四月份购进竹扫帚苗八万斤，及时组织一批手工业工人进行加工，约可加工出一万六千把扫帚，加上从外区采购的二千三百把，比去年供应数量增加了五倍。该社还向当地木业生产合作社订购了两千把木杈，已及时调拨到基层社。该县城关区合作社在八天中，就卖出扫帚二百六十八把、木杈四十把。五庄村有些农民满意地说：“合作社想得真周到，麦收还没有到，扫帚就来了！”（吕桂元　张庆霖）

    陕西省兴平县供销合作社配合夏收准备工作，大力供应农具。现已推销各种农具二十八种，十二万七千三百件。预计夏收前供应的农具价值达去年同期的九倍。
    这个供销合作社依靠基层社，组织当地手工业者就地取材、就地加工，满足农民对生产资料的需要。去年供销合作社只有两个单位进行小量订货，今年全县八个基层社同县联社组织了三十九组包括木、皮、竹、铁类手工业者进行多样性生产资料的加工。供销合作社除及时供给手工业者以优等原料，核订成本、监督生产，凭规格验收外，并经常向手工业者进行政治思想教育，说明生产农具对农业生产的重大意义，要求农具件件结实，耐用，便宜，及时。目前所产铁大耙、?背、牛革头等九种农业用具销售量已突破原预订数。较大农具的价格都比市场的价格低三、四千元到一万元以上。像生产的背笼每个“经”竹比私营多两条，密度达到每个笼用竹一百一十条，而单位价格只卖一万四千元，比市场便宜三千到四千元。供销社出售的大车，群众说：“就是把木匠叫到家中做，还不保能做得那样结实。”
    供销合作社还组织木工下乡，修理旧农具，据统计，从今年四月十日到五月十日的三十天中，已给农民修好大车七十八辆。
    兴平供销合作社经过去年整顿和今年的学习总路线后，明确了经营思想，成立生产资料供应机构，领导干部亲自了解市场情况，组织供应，使得今年供应工作有了很大改进。  （根蒂）
