Xinhua News Agency Report: The capital's industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction workers have reached more than 500,000, more than three times the number in 1950.

With the development of industrial production, especially the start of large-scale basic construction, the capital's workforce has been continuously expanding. The basic construction and municipal construction workforce reached more than 90,000 when construction started in March last year, and has continued to increase to more than 100,000 this year. A large number of young people have joined industrial production. The number of young workers in the city's factories and mines is now nine times higher than in 1951. Many outstanding technical workers have been promoted to technical personnel and cadres.

The socialist consciousness of the capital's workers has greatly improved, and the Party's ranks in industrial and mining enterprises have continued to expand. The number of Communist Party members in the city's factories and mines increased nearly twofold in 1953 compared to 1952. The number of Communist Youth League members is now nearly six times higher than in 1951. After studying the Party's General Line for the transition period, the workers' awareness has been further enhanced. Since the study of the General Line in twelve factories and mining enterprises such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Jingxi Mining Bureau, more than 750 employees have applied to join the Communist Party of China, many of whom are veteran workers.

Due to the growth of the working class and the improvement of socialist consciousness and technical level, the city's factories and mining enterprises overfulfilled the state plan by 4.9% in 1953. In 1953, the total value of industrial production of state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises in the city increased sixfold compared to 1949. In the first quarter of this year, the city's factories and mining enterprises again overfulfilled the production plan by 5.3%, and the total value of production increased by 41.98% compared to the first quarter of last year. There are now more than 400 basic construction sites in the city, and the construction area has reached 20% of the original housing area in Beijing before liberation.

Xinhua News Agency Report: In the past half year, more than 11,000 outstanding employees in Shanghai factories have joined the Communist Party of China.

Since the publicity of the state's general task during the transition period in the fourth quarter of last year, Shanghai's working class has greatly improved its awareness and its enthusiasm for building socialism has been unprecedentedly high. Many employees have submitted requests to join the Party to the Party branches. In the first quarter, more than 1,200 employees in Shanghai's 41 state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories submitted written or oral requests to the Party branch to join the Party. Many of the employees who have joined the Communist Party of China in the past half year are veteran workers with more than ten years of service and a spirit of technical innovation. Among the employees who joined the Party, there are also ordinary young workers. In the first quarter of this year, more than 60 technicians from 83 heavy industry and textile industry factories in Shanghai joined the Communist Party.

    首都工人阶级队伍不断壮大
    近半年来上海一万多职工加入共产党
    据新华社讯：首都各工矿企业和基本建设职工已有五十多万人，比一九五零年增加了两倍多。
    随着工业生产的发展，特别是大规模基本建设的开始，首都工人队伍不断地扩大了。基本建设和市政建设工人队伍去年三月开工时曾达到九万多人，今年继续增加到十万多人。大批青年参加工业生产，现在全市厂矿企业中青年工人比一九五一年增加了九倍。许多优秀的技术工人已被提拔为技术人员和干部。
    首都工人们的社会主义觉悟大大提高了，党在工矿企业中的队伍不断扩大了。全市厂矿企业中的共产党员，一九五三年比一九五二年增加了近一倍。青年团员现在则比一九五一年增加了近六倍。经过学习党在过渡时期的总路线，工人们的觉悟有了进一步的提高。石景山钢铁厂、京西矿务局等十二个厂矿企业单位学习总路线以来，已有七百五十多个职工申请参加中国共产党，其中有很多是老工人。
    由于工人阶级队伍的壮大，社会主义觉悟水平和技术水平的提高，全市厂矿企业一九五三年超额百分之四点九完成了国家计划。一九五三年全市国营、地方国营和公私合营工业的生产总值比一九四九年增加了六倍。今年第一季度，全市各厂矿企业又超额百分之五点三完成了生产计划，生产总值比去年第一季度增长了百分之四十一点九八。现在全市已有四百多个基本建设工地，建筑的面积达到北京市解放前原有房屋面积的百分之二十。
    据新华社讯：近半年来，上海市各工厂中已有一万一千多个优秀职工加入中国共产党。
    自从去年第四季度宣传国家过渡时期总任务以后，上海工人阶级觉悟大大提高、建设社会主义的热情空前高涨，很多职工向党支部提出了入党的请求。上海市四十一个国营和公私合营的棉纺织厂，在第一季内用书面或口头向党支部提出入党请求的有一千二百多人。近半年来加入中国共产党的职工中，有许多十年以上工龄、富有技术革新精神的老工人。入党的职工中，也有普通的青年工人。今年第一季度，上海八十三个重工业和纺织工业工厂中有六十多个技术人员参加了共产党。
