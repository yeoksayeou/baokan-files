Silkworm production is an important sideline occupation in the rural areas of Southwest China. In the five special districts of Nanchong, Suining, Mianyang, Jiangjin, and Leshan in Sichuan Province, there are more than 30 counties that are major silkworm production areas. Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces also have some areas that produce silk. Since liberation, with the support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, silkworm production in various places has rapidly recovered and developed. In 1953, silk production increased by 146% compared with 1950, of which the cocoon yield of improved silkworm varieties increased by about two times. The number of employees in the silk industry has also increased from more than 5,000 in 1950 to more than 20,000, and the silk production has increased more than five times, with most of the quality meeting standards.

The development of silkworm production has improved the lives of silkworm farmers. Due to the gradual increase in cocoon production and cocoon prices, the income of silkworm farmers has increased by 3.8 times compared with 1950. In some areas, the income from selling cocoons accounts for 30% to 60% of the farmers' total annual income. Taking Xichong and Yanting counties in Sichuan as examples, Xichong's cocoon sales income in 1952 reached more than 15 billion yuan. In addition, the income from the by-product "silkworm excrement" (i.e., silkworm manure) for fertilizer also reached more than 6 billion yuan. The cocoon sales income of Yanting farmers in 1952 reached more than 11.9 billion yuan, and the "silkworm excrement" income was 5.8 billion yuan, which can provide fertilizer for 50,000 mu of paddy fields. Sichuan Province raises two seasons of silkworms every year, and the "silkworm excrement" can fertilize more than 700,000 mu of farmland.

The silkworm guidance stations under the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau have led the masses to carry out comprehensive pruning and pest control of mulberry trees last winter and this spring in order to rapidly increase silk production. Generally, 10% to 20% of mulberry trees have been renovated. In Xichong, Yanting, Nanbu, Hechuan, Tongliang and other counties, about 80% of the mulberry trees have been pruned, which has increased the production of mulberry leaves by more than 50% this spring. At present, the silkworm technical guidance stations are promoting advanced Soviet experience and the production increase experiences among the masses, focusing on organized silkworm households, and are trying to sign contracts for pre-purchasing cocoons with production cooperatives.

    西南各地农村蚕丝生产逐渐发展
    蚕丝生产是西南农村重要副业，四川南充、遂宁、绵阳、江津、乐山等五个专区中有三十余县为蚕丝主要产地；云南、贵州、西康等省也有部分地区出产蚕丝。解放以来，在共产党和人民政府的扶持下，各地蚕丝生产已迅速恢复和发展，一九五三年蚕丝生产即较一九五○年增加了百分之一百四十六，其中改良蚕种产茧量增加约二倍；丝绸工业职工亦由一九五○年五千余人增至二万余人，蚕丝产量则增至五倍以上，质量大都合乎标准。
    蚕丝生产的发展改善了蚕农生活。由于蚕茧产量和茧价的逐步提高，蚕农收入已比一九五○年增加了三点八倍，在某些地区卖茧收入占农民全年总收入的百分之三十至六十。以四川西充、盐亭两县为例，西充在一九五二年的卖茧收入达一百五十余亿元，此外，副产品“蚕沙”（即蚕粪）积肥收益亦达六十余亿元；盐亭农民一九五二年的卖茧收入达一百一十九亿余元，“蚕沙”收益五十八亿元，可供五万亩稻田的肥料。四川省每年养两季蚕，“蚕沙”即可肥田七十余万亩。
    西南纺织管理局所属各蚕桑指导所、站为迅速增加蚕丝产量，在去冬今春曾领导群众，全面地开展了桑树修枝除虫工作。一般地区有百分之十至二十的桑树经过整修，西充、盐亭、南部、合川、铜梁等县，有百分之八十左右的桑树曾进行了修剪，使今春桑叶增产百分之五十以上。目前，各蚕桑技术指导所、站，正根据苏联先进经验及群众中的增产经验，以组织起来的蚕户为重点进行推广，并试行与生产合作社订立预购蚕茧的合同。
