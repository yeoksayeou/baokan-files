    Irresponsible Medical Personnel
    --Reader Visit
    Beijing citizen Yang Changchun visited the reader's letter group of this newspaper on April 28th, criticizing the serious medical accident caused by the careless and irresponsible behavior of Zhu Xuanzhi and Zhang Sheng, surgeons at Peking University Hospital in this city, when they performed an appendectomy on his son, Yang De. He said: "Yang De suffered from appendicitis and underwent surgery at Peking University Hospital on February 27th, performed by doctors Zhu Xuanzhi and Zhang Sheng. After five or six days, Yang De's temperature rose to above 38 degrees Celsius. Examination revealed that the wound was infected. At that time, the doctor thought that Yang De's wound infection was caused by peritonitis and that only injections to reduce inflammation were needed. By March 15th, the infection of the wound still showed no improvement. Zhao Yanwu, an intern at the hospital, used tweezers to insert a cotton ball into Yang De's wound to wipe away the pus, but dropped a small cotton ball into the wound. When Dr. Zhao inserted long tweezers into the wound to find the cotton ball, he pulled out a piece of gauze six or seven inches long and wide. This proved that Yang De's wound infection was caused by the doctors sewing this piece of gauze inside his abdomen after the surgery. Later, after more than a month of treatment, the wound was still oozing pus, and because of the long-term infection of the wound, the intestines also rotted, and on April 18th, an ascarid worm crawled out of the intestine from the wound. This added a new burden to Yang De, who had been suffering for a long time. Later, after another week or so, the wound gradually closed. Under normal circumstances, many people who undergo appendectomy can be cured and discharged from the hospital in about a week with only a small amount of medical expenses; but Yang De stayed in the hospital for more than two months and spent four times the medical expenses. The reason why Yang De suffered from long-term pain and excessive financial burden was entirely due to the irresponsibility of doctors Zhu Xuanzhi and Zhang Sheng towards the patient during the surgery. Therefore, I suggest that Peking University Hospital should seriously investigate this medical accident and use this medical accident to educate all medical staff in the hospital to overcome any lack of responsibility and careless medical practices towards patients, in order to avoid the occurrence of medical accidents."
    The problem reflected by Yang Changchun has been verified by this newspaper's investigation. Peking University Hospital should seriously and earnestly investigate and deal with this medical accident.

### 不负责任的医务人员——读者来访

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不负责任的医务人员
    ——读者来访
    北京市民杨常春于四月二十八日来访本报读者来信组，对本市北大医院外科医生朱宣智、张胜在给他的儿子杨德切除阑尾炎时，因为粗心大意不负责任所造成的严重医疗事故提出批评。他说：“杨德患阑尾炎，二月二十七日在北大医院由朱宣智和张胜二位医生施行手术切除。过了五、六天，杨德体温升到摄氏三十八度以上，经检查发现伤口化脓。当时医生认为杨德的伤口化脓是由于腹膜炎所引起，只要注射药针消炎就行了。到了三月十五日，伤口的化脓状况仍不见好转，该院实习医生赵炎武用镊子挟着棉球探入杨德的伤口内拭脓，却把一个小棉球掉在伤口里了。当赵医生用长镊子伸入伤口内寻找棉球时，却从伤口内拉出来一块六、七寸长宽的纱布。这才证明：杨德的伤口化脓原是医生做完手术之后，把这块纱布缝在肚皮内而引起的。后来经过了一个多月的治疗，伤口仍是流脓不止，并且因伤口长期化脓，肠子也腐烂了，四月十八日一条蛔虫钻出肠外从伤口爬出来。这就使长期受着痛苦的杨德又增加了新的负担。后来，又过了一星期左右，伤口才逐渐衔合起来。根据一般情况，许多人切除阑尾炎，只要住院一个星期左右，用不多的医药费就可以治愈出院了；可是杨德则住了两个多月的医院，化了四倍的医药费。杨德所以长期受着痛苦的折磨和过多的经济负担，完全由于朱宣智、张胜二位医生在做手术时对患者不负责任所造成的。因此我建议北大医院应该认真地检查这医疗事故，并通过这一次医疗事故教育全院的医务工作人员，克服任何对病人缺乏责任感和粗枝大叶的医疗作风，以避免医疗事故的发生。”
    杨常春所反映的问题，经本报派人调查属实。北大医院应该严肃认真地检查处理这个医疗事故。
