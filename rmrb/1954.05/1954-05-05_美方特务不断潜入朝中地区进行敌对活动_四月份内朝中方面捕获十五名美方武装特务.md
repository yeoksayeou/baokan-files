Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th - Disregarding repeated protests from our side, the US side continued to violate the Armistice Agreement in April, constantly dispatching armed personnel to infiltrate the Korean-Chinese area to conduct hostile activities.

On the morning of April 10th, around 9:00 AM, our troops stationed on Daesuyap Island discovered a small US wooden boat about 1,000 meters southeast of the island. They surrounded the boat, which had intruded into the sea area under our control, and captured all five US armed secret agents on board: Yu Hanzhen, An Zhonglie, Li Zhenhao, Zheng Shunzai, and Shen Xuexi. These US armed secret agents were all wearing US military uniforms and carrying one US-made BR light machine gun with over 400 rounds of ammunition, three MI rifles with over 110 rounds of ammunition, and one hand grenade. They also carried seven types of documents and orders issued by the US side, including intelligence agent certificates, special ship navigation certificates, travel orders, and instructions for carrying out this mission. The intelligence agent certificates stated that these agents were intelligence officers from the 9th detachment of the 18th area team of the Li (Syngman Rhee) puppet army's intelligence unit. The certificates were signed by Li puppet army Major Choi Tae-ju.

According to the captured US armed secret agents, they were intelligence personnel from the 2nd detachment of the 9th branch of the 18th district team of the Li Seungman army's HID intelligence unit. On April 9th, Li Zhongzhi, the leader of the 2nd detachment, ordered them to infiltrate the Korean-Chinese area of the Haeju Peninsula to conduct hostile activities. That day at 19:00, they boarded the "Northward Advance" steamer (which carried a small wooden boat for landing) from Udo Island and arrived at Yeonpyeong Island around 21:00. After refueling on the island, they departed again at 22:00, but the steamer broke down near Wunchuan Cave on the Haeju Peninsula. By dawn on the 10th, the steamer had not been repaired. Fearing that they would be discovered by our side after dawn, they switched to the small wooden boat and fled. The wooden boat drifted with the current near Daesuyap Island, where they were captured by us.

The other four incidents of US armed personnel infiltrating our area to conduct hostile activities are as follows: On April 6th at 22:00, our garrison troops captured three US-sent armed secret agents, Yu Zhonglin, Jin Yongcai, and Han Wanshou, near Palhak-ri, southeast of Haeju. According to these armed secret agents, they were personnel of the Paeun Island Yuehou unit of the US 8103 unit. On April 2nd, the team leader, Jin Yuanfu, ordered five of them to collect intelligence and conduct harassment in the Korean-Chinese area. On April 6th at 16:00, they carried one US-made radio, one BR light machine gun, two MI rifles, five carbine rifles, and two signal flags, and boarded the "Taiyang" steamer from Paeun Island, landing near Palhak-ri, southeast of Haeju, to infiltrate the Korean-Chinese area. After our garrison troops discovered them, they captured three of the five agents and seized three carbine rifles and one radio. The other two agents escaped.

On April 6th at 22:00, our garrison troops captured Won Jeong-bok, an armed secret agent sent by the US 8007 unit from Baengnyeong Island, in Jinsan-ri, Ongjin County. This agent carried a pistol and a camera.

On April 9th at 9:00 AM, a unit of our army stationed on the east coast captured three US secret agents, Xu Zhu-hu, Xu Luo-huo, and Quan Yun-mo. They were all personnel of the Li puppet army's HID intelligence unit. On April 8th at 19:00, they departed from Jukjin-ri in two wooden boats to infiltrate our area to collect intelligence.

On April 10th, a unit of our army stationed near Goseong captured three US armed secret agents, Park Chang-hee, Kim Chang-gu, and Kim Taek-cheol. These agents were also dispatched by the US secret service HID to our area to carry out hostile activities. On April 9th at 22:00, carrying one US-made pistol and one submachine gun each, they departed from Sokcho-ri in two wooden boats to infiltrate our area.

    美方特务不断潜入朝中地区进行敌对活动
    四月份内朝中方面捕获十五名美方武装特务
    【新华社开城四日电】美方不顾我方的一再抗议，在四月份内继续违反停战协定，不断地派遣武装人员侵入朝中方面地区进行敌对活动。
    四月十日上午九时左右，我方驻大睡鸭岛部队发现离该岛东南约一千公尺处有美方的一只小木船，就将这只侵入我方控制地区海面的木船包围，并且把船上的美方武装特务俞汉镇、安忠烈、李镇镐、郑顺在和申学熙等五名全部捕获。这些美方武装特务都身着美军服装，携带有美制BR轻机枪一挺、子弹四百余发，MI枪三枝、子弹一百一十余发，手榴弹一枚。这些人还携带有美方发给的谍报员证、船舶特别运航证、出差命令和执行这次任务的指示等七种证件和命令。在这些特务携带的谍报员证上，写明这些特务都是李伪军陆军谍报部队第十八地区队第九支队的谍报员。签发这种证件的是李伪军陆军少领（按：即少校）崔太举。
    据这些被捕获的美方武装特务供称，他们是李承晚军队陆军谍报部队HID第十八地区队第九支队第二分遣队的谍报人员。四月九日，第二分遣队队长李钟植命令他们潜入海州半岛朝中方面地区进行敌对活动。当天十九时，他们就乘坐“北进号”汽船（这艘汽船带有小木船一只，以供登陆之用）从隅岛出发，到二十一时左右到达延坪岛。他们在该岛添加汽油后，又在二十二时出发，但汽船驶到海州半岛文串洞附近时发生故障。到十日黎明时，汽船尚未修好。他们唯恐天明后被我方发觉，就换乘小木船逃跑，木船顺水飘到大睡鸭岛附近时被我捕获。
    其他四次美方武装人员侵入我方地区进行敌对活动的事件如下：四月六日二十二时，我方驻军在海州东南八鹤里附近捕获美方派遣的武装特务俞钟林、金永采、韩万寿三名。据这些武装特务供称：他们是美方八一零三部队乶音岛越后部队的人员。四月二日，该队队长金元福命令他们五个人到朝中地区搜集情报和进行骚扰。四月六日十六时，他们携带美制报话机一部、BR轻机枪一挺、MI枪两枝、卡宾枪五枝和信号旗两面，乘“太阳号”汽船从乶音岛出发，在海州东南八鹤里附近登陆潜入朝中地区。我方驻军发觉后，捕获这五个特务中的三名，并缴获卡宾枪三枝、报话机一部，其他两名特务脱逃。
    四月六日二十二时，我方驻军在瓮津郡津山里捕获白翎岛美方八零零七部队派来的武装特务元正福一名。这个特务带有手枪一枝，照像机一架。
    四月九日九时，驻东海岸的我军某部捕获美方特务徐主虎、徐落活、全尹模三名。他们都是李伪军谍报部队HID的人员，四月八日十九时乘木船两只从猪津里出发，潜入我区进行搜集情报的活动。
    四月十日，驻高城附近我军某部捕获美方武装特务朴昌熙、金昌九、金泽喆三名。这些特务也是美方特务机关HID派遣到我方地区来进行敌对活动的。他们在四月九日二十二时，携带美造短枪和冲锋枪各一枝，乘木船二只由束草里出发潜入我区。
