    The Nation's Regards Encourage the Most Beloved People
    Repaying Loved Ones with Practical Actions
    These are truly exciting days. The soldiers stationed at the southern gate of the motherland crossed the beaches, passed through the coconut groves, chased after cars, and bid farewell to the envoys of the people of the whole country with tears of excitement and gratitude in their eyes. When they couldn't catch up with the representatives' cars, they climbed up trees and mountains, looking back at their loved ones, not stopping until they could no longer see even the dust kicked up by the cars.
    The "Guohua Company" of a certain unit stationed on Hainan Island regards March 18th – the day the representatives came to their company – as a permanent memorial day. After receiving the regards, soldier Hong Yibang firmly stated: "I will always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and I will stand guard for the people of the whole country for the rest of my life." On the night of receiving the regards, soldier Ma Duo of the 12th Company of a certain unit even shouted in his sleep: "Long live Chairman Mao!" The soldiers of the 7th Company, stationed on the Leizhou Peninsula, who once attacked Cuiwei Peak during the bandit suppression in Jiangxi and participated in the filming of the movie "Red Flag on Cui Gang," went to the club every day to see the banner presented by the people of the whole country, considering it the most glorious banner of the entire company. New soldier Weng Zhijiang even secretly swore an oath in front of the banner at night. He said: "This is the glory that Chairman Mao gave to the old comrades who participated in the battle. We must maintain this glory!"
    In these days, what every soldier in every post is thinking, saying, and doing is one thing: repaying loved ones with practical actions. In the recent shooting exercise of the "Tashan Defense Hero Company," all ten shooters who participated in the exercise achieved "Excellent" grades. The "Tenacious Assault Company" recently scored full marks for all comrades of the heroic 11th squad in a tactical test. They said, "This is what our loved ones brought!" During a recent tactical exercise, telephone squad soldier Long Qiwu of a certain artillery unit fell into a knee-deep pit while running, spraining his ankle. His face changed with the pain, but when he thought of his determination when receiving the regards—"to learn skills without fear of any difficulties"—he gritted his teeth and struggled to continue running forward, finally completing the task.
    Motherland! Please feel free to build: your outstanding children are fulfilling the promises they made to you, practicing their skills, increasing their vigilance, and defending you! (Tian Ye)
    "Maintain Glory, Carry Forward Glory!"
    The night is deep. After a day of intense labor, everyone is sound asleep. Only Guo Chunyuan, the squad leader of the 9th squad, is still tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. He is wondering what the 9th squad can do to welcome their loved ones, now that the envoys of the people of the whole country are about to arrive. The technical squad has already created a four-corner turntable tile-making machine that can produce seven or eight hundred tiles a day, while the 9th squad still has only three people using old tools and old methods, working hard all day to produce only two hundred tiles. How can this be like an old meritorious squad of the company? At this moment, those glorious flags flashed through his mind. In 1940, with the existence of this company, this squad was created, and with the existence of this squad, the honors have been constantly maintained. During the Hundred Regiments Offensive in the War of Resistance Against Japan, this squad won a banner; during the Liberation War, from the battles in the Central Plains to opening up the Funiu Mountain base area, all the way to crossing the Yangtze River, liberating Guangdong and Guangxi, and advancing into Yunnan, this squad received continuous rewards; during the bandit suppression operations in 1951 and the cultural march in 1952, two more banners fell into this squad. However, now, in the task of building tiles for the border, compared to the technical squad, the 9th squad is lagging behind. Thinking of this, Guo Chunyuan could no longer calm down. He said to himself: "If we cannot carry forward the glory, we cannot maintain the glory, so will we allow the glory of the 9th squad to be interrupted like this? No, we can't, we must catch up!"
    From the next day, Guo Chunyuan mobilized the entire squad to brainstorm ideas for making a more efficient tile-making machine, and he himself worked day and night, painstakingly researching. In less than a week, news spread throughout the entire detachment: the 9th squad's six-corner turntable tile-making machine was successfully manufactured, capable of producing 1,256 tiles a day.
    Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the representatives arrived at the construction site. The technical squad and the 9th squad each demonstrated the effectiveness of their machines to the representatives. The representatives shook hands with them one by one, expressing their respect. Only Guo Chunyuan, the squad leader of the 9th squad, hid aside because his hands were covered in mud. Representative Wang Ling stepped forward and warmly shook his hand, saying excitedly:
    "Your hands can take up guns to eliminate enemies and defend the country, and they can take up tools to create wealth and build the border. Your hands are glorious hands, omnipotent hands. It is our greatest honor to be able to shake hands with you." Guo Chunyuan stood blankly in front of Comrade Wang Ling and replied uneasily: "I am a Communist Party member. I want to make our squad maintain glory and carry forward glory." (Wang Dingyi)
    A Banner
    Since the banner presented by the慰问团 (comfort delegation) was hung in the club of the "Red First Company," the labor enthusiasm of the "Red First Company" soldiers has been even higher. Whether transporting materials on steep slopes, sawing planks in deep valleys, or felling trees in the original old forests, new records are emerging everywhere. The three-class meritorious worker Pu Tiansheng's group, which is responsible for sawing planks, originally had a quota of sawing twenty-four rafters a day. In order to welcome the loved ones, they increased it to thirty-eight, and now they have reached sixty-two. The 7th and 8th squads, which are responsible for transporting materials, ran eighty to ninety miles of mountain roads a day, braving the wind and rain, and transported 126 large materials, exceeding the quota by one time. Soldier Shi Hongbin transported seventeen trees by himself. He said, "Transporting one more material will add one more point of glory to our "Red First Company," and it will add a ray of light to our banner." Two-class meritorious worker Rao Guomin said, "Thinking of that bright red flag, I feel more strength all over my body. Even though the wind is cold, I have a fiery heart, and even though the rain is heavy, I have the steely will to overcome difficulties."
    The night is deep. However, Guo Peizhong, a first-class bandit-suppression hero, kept tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. As soon as he closed his eyes, the scene of the motherland's socialist construction floated before his eyes. He seemed to see the chimneys of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the heavy industry base of the motherland, smoking; Wang Chonglun, who was ahead of schedule and completed more than four years of production tasks in a year, working intensely in the workshop; a train covered in red and green speeding westward through the large iron bridge across the Xiangjiang River; the Gejiu Highway passing through deep mountains and valleys, rapidly extending towards the border... He also thought of the banner that the delegation gave to the "Red First Company," of the oath of the whole company in front of the banner, and of the solemn and powerful oath: "For a better tomorrow, we must study hard, strengthen our training, build a steel border, defend our beloved motherland, and be the most beloved people." Thinking and thinking, he could no longer fall asleep. He got out of bed, lit the lamp, and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao with great care: "...I will use my wisdom, sweat, and even my life to complete the cause entrusted to me by the Party and the people, and defend the motherland's railways, factories, and mines..."
    The banner is hung in the club of the "Red First Company," no, it is hung in the heart of every soldier. How many clapper talks and poems have the soldiers written to praise it and sing its praises! Please see a small section of the poem written by Ma Weiwen, the deputy squad leader of the 7th squad:
    Banner! Banner! Bright and beautiful,
    I love you like my eyes, like the weapon in my hand,
    Standing in front of you, I feel like I am in my mother's arms,
    Because you represent millions of mothers,
    You represent the heart of Chairman Mao! (Zhang Gan)

### 全国人民的慰问鼓舞着最可爱的人

    全国人民的慰问鼓舞着最可爱的人
    用实际行动报答亲人
    这正是激动人心的日子。驻守在祖国南大门的战士们越过沙滩，穿过椰子林，追着汽车，含着兴奋和感激的眼泪送别全国人民的使者。当他们追不上代表们的汽车的时候，便攀上树梢，爬上高山，留恋地望着亲人，一直望到连汽车掀起的尘埃都看不见时才回连队。
    驻守在海南岛的某部“国华连”，把三月十八日——代表们来到他们连队的日子，作为永远的纪念日。战士洪益邦受到慰问后坚决地表示：“我要永远当毛主席的好战士，为全国人民站一辈子岗。”某部十二连战士马铎在接受慰问的当晚，在睡梦中还高喊：“毛主席万岁！”驻守在雷州半岛的、曾经在江西剿匪时主攻翠微峰并参加拍摄“翠岗红旗”影片的七连战士们，每天川流不息地到俱乐部去看全国人民赠送的锦旗，认为这是全连最光荣的一面旗帜。新战士翁志江夜里还悄悄地到锦旗前宣誓。他说：“这是毛主席给参加战斗的老同志的光荣，我们要保持这种光荣！”
    这些天来，在各个岗位上的每一个战士心里想的，嘴里说的，动手做的都是一件事：用实际行动来报答亲人。“塔山守备英雄连”的战士们在最近射击演习中，参加演习的十个射手全部得到了“优秀”级的成绩。“顽强冲杀连”最近在战术测验时，英雄的十一班全体同志都得了满分。他们说：“这是亲人们带来的！”炮兵某部电话班战士龙琦武在最近一次的战术演习中，跑步时跌进一个没膝深的土坑，歪了脚脖子，痛得他脸色都变了，可是，他一想到接受慰问时所下的决心——“不怕一切困难学好本领”，便一咬牙挣扎起来继续往前奔去，终于完成了任务。
    祖国啊！请你放手建设吧：你的优秀儿女，正在履行他们向你们表达过的诺言，练好本领，提高警惕，保卫你啊！（天野）
    “保持光荣，发扬光荣！”
    夜深了，经过一天紧张的劳动，大家都已熟睡。只有九班班长郭春远还在翻来覆去地不能入睡。他在想，全国人民的使者就要来了，我们这个班用什么迎接亲人呢？技工班已经创造了四角转盘制瓦机，一天作出七八百桶瓦，而九班还是三个人，使用的还是旧工具，老办法，死劲干上一天，才出得二百来桶瓦，这怎么像个连队的老功臣班呢？这时，那些一面面光荣的旗帜在他脑海中闪过。一九四○年，有了这个连，就有了这个班，有了这个班，就有了不断保持着的荣誉。抗日战争时期的百团大战中，这个班就得过一面奖旗；解放战争中从转战中原，开辟伏牛山根据地，一直到抢渡长江，解放两广，进军云南，这个班又连续得到奖励；一九五一年的剿匪作战中，一九五二年的文化大进军中又有两面奖旗落到这个班里。可是，现在在建设边疆的制瓦任务中，比起技工班来，九班是落后了。想到这里，郭春远再也无法平静了，他自言自语起来：“发扬不了光荣，也就保持不住光荣，那么，就这样让九班的光荣中断了吗？不，不能，一定得赶上去！”
    从第二天起，郭春远就发动全班为制作效率更高的制瓦机而动脑筋了，他自己更是白天黑夜，苦心钻研。不到一个星期，一个消息在全支队传开了：九班六角转盘制瓦机制造成功了，一天可出瓦一千二百五十六桶。
    锣鼓喧天之中，代表们来到了工地，技工班和第九班分别给代表们表演着这两部机器的效能，代表们和他们一一握手，表示敬意，只有九班班长郭春远，因为满手是泥，躲在一旁。代表王凌同志走上前去抓住他的手热烈地握起来，并且激动地说：
  “你们的手，拿起枪可以消灭敌人，保卫国防，拿起工具就能创造财富建设边疆，你们的手是光荣的手，是万能的手，我们能和你们握手是最大的荣幸”。郭春远怔怔地站在王凌同志面前，不安地答道：“我是共产党员，要使我们班保持光荣发扬光荣。”（王定一）
      一面锦旗
    自从“红一连”的俱乐部里挂起了慰问团赠送的那面锦旗以后，“红一连”战士们的劳动热情更高了。不管在陡坡上运材料，不管在深涧里解板，不管在原始老林中伐木，到处都在出现新纪录。担任解板的三等功臣普天生小组，上级规定一天解二十四根椽子，他们为了迎接亲人提高到三十八根，现在达到了六十二根。担负运材料任务的七班和八班，顶着风，冒着雨，一天跑八九十里的山路，还运了一百二十六棵大料，超过定额一倍。战士石鸿彬一个人就运了十七棵，他说：“多运一根材料，就给我们“红一连”增加一分光荣，也就给我们那面锦旗添上一道光彩。”二等功臣饶国民说：“想到那面鲜艳的红旗，浑身就增加了力气，风冷，我有颗火热的心，雨大，我有战胜困难的钢铁意志。”
    夜深了。可是，甲等剿匪英雄郭培忠翻来覆去老是睡不着。一合眼，祖国的社会主义建设的景象就浮在他的眼前。他仿佛看到祖国的重工业基地鞍山钢铁公司的烟囱在冒烟；走在时间前面一年完成四年多生产任务的王崇伦在车间紧张地工作；一列披红挂绿的火车正穿过横跨湘江的大铁桥飞也似地向西奔驰；个旧公路穿过深山峡谷，正迅速向边疆伸展……他又想起了慰问团送给“红一连”的锦旗，想起了全连在锦旗前面的宣誓，想起了那庄严有力的誓词：“为了美好的明天，我们要努力学习，加强锻炼，建设钢铁的边疆，保卫可爱的祖国，做一个最可爱的人。”想着，想着，他再也睡不着了。他从床上爬起来，点燃了灯，很用心地给毛主席写了一封信：“……我要用我的智慧，血汗甚至生命来完成党和人民托付给我的事业，保卫祖国的铁路、工厂、矿山……”
    锦旗挂在“红一连”的俱乐部里，不，它挂在每一个战士的心坎上，战士们写了多少快板和诗歌来赞扬它歌颂它啊！请看七班副班长马卫文写的诗歌里的一小段吧：
    锦旗！锦旗！鲜艳美丽，
    我爱你像眼睛，像手中的武器，
    我站在你的跟前，就像在母亲的怀里，
    因为你代表着千千万万个母亲，
    你代表着毛主席的心意！（张干）
