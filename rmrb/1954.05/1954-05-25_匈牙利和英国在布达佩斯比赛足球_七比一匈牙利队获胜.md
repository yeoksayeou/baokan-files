    Hungary and England Play Soccer in Budapest
    Hungary Wins 7-1
    [By Our Correspondent] Budapest Dispatch: On May 23rd, the Hungarian national football team and the English football team held a football match at the People's Stadium in Budapest. Among the more than 100,000 spectators, there were people who had come from all over Europe specifically to watch the game. As a result of the competition, the Hungarian team won with an overwhelming advantage of seven to one.
    When the players of both sides entered the field, the audience welcomed them with thunderous applause. The game began with the whistle of the famous Italian referee, Mr. Bernardi. The Hungarian team immediately began to attack with agility and skillful techniques, pressing toward the opponent's goal. In the first few minutes of the match, the Hungarian team had many opportunities to shoot. In the seventh minute, the Hungarian team's right inside forward, Kocsis, missed a shot. Two minutes later, the Hungarian team had a free kick opportunity 22 meters from the English goal. The English players lined up to save the dangerous ball, but due to a powerful low shot by the Hungarian right back, Lantos, the football finally passed through the legs of the English players, making it impossible for the English goalkeeper, Merrick, to save. In the following twenty minutes, the Hungarian team continued to show excellent technique. The Hungarian team launched a series of skillful offensives. In the attack, Puskas, Kocsis, and Czibor performed extremely well. Under their sharp attacks, the English defense immediately collapsed completely. In the twentieth and thirtieth minutes, Puskas and Kocsis each scored a goal. The first half ended with a score of three to zero.
    After the start of the second half, the English players launched several offensives. The offensive of the English center backs Wright and Dickinson and the movements of the left-winger Finney attracted the attention of the audience, but they did not achieve anything. In the thirteenth minute, the Hungarian team again launched an offensive towards the opponent's goal. At this time, the English defense, which was considered to be strong, seemed completely unable to resist the rapid and continuous attacks of the Hungarian team. As a result, in a short five minutes – in the thirteenth, sixteenth, and eighteenth minutes after the start of the second half – Kocsis, Tóth – a new member of the national football team – and Hidegkuti each scored a goal. At this time, the score on the field was six to zero, and the Hungarian team had an absolute advantage. Soon, the English forward Broadis kicked a ball into the goal that the Hungarian goalkeeper could not defend against during an attack. Two minutes later, Puskas received a ball passed forward by Hidegkuti and shot fiercely into the goal.
    In this game, the Hungarian team's performance was extremely wonderful from beginning to end, winning unanimous praise from the audience.

    匈牙利和英国在布达佩斯比赛足球
    七比一匈牙利队获胜
    【本报讯】据布达佩斯消息：五月二十三日，匈牙利国家足球队和英国足球队在布达佩斯人民体育场举行了足球比赛。在数达十万多的观众中，包括有从欧洲各国特地赶来观看球赛的人们。比赛结果，匈牙利队以七比一的压倒优势获胜。
    当双方队员进入球场时，观众们以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎了他们。比赛在意大利著名裁判员伯南地的哨子声中开始。匈牙利队立即以敏捷的动作和巧妙的技术开始全力攻击，并进逼对方球门。在比赛开始后的几分钟内，匈牙利队就获得了不少射门的机会。在七分钟时，匈牙利队右内锋柯启士射门未中。又两分钟后，匈牙利队在距英国球门二十二公尺处获得罚自由球的机会，英国队员为了抢救险球而排成一列，但是由于匈牙利队右后卫蓝多士的猛力低射，足球终于穿过了英国队员们的腿际，而使英国守门员麦力克无法挽救。匈牙利队在以后的二十分钟内，继续表现着出色的技术。匈牙利队发动了一连串巧妙的攻势。在进攻中，普希卡士、柯启士和齐波尔三人表演极为精采。在他们的锐利的进攻之下，英国队的防线立刻全面瓦解。二十分钟和三十分钟时，普希卡士和柯启士分别射入一球。上半场以三比零结束。
    下半时开始后，英国队员们曾发动了几次攻势。英国队的中卫莱特和狄根逊的进攻和左翼芬尼的动作吸引了场上观众的注意，但都无建树。十三分钟时，匈牙利队又开始向对方球门发起攻势。这时，被人们认为强有力的英国队的防线，看来是完全无力抵挡匈牙利队迅速的和连续的进攻了。结果在短短的五分钟内——下半场开始后的第十三分钟、第十六分钟和第十八分钟时，由柯启士、陶士——国家足球队的新队员和希代古提分别射入一球。这时场上的纪录是六比零，匈牙利队占绝对优势。不久，英国队的前锋布劳底斯在进攻中以匈牙利守门员无法防范的一球踢入球门。两分钟后，普希卡士接到由希代古提向前传来的一球，猛射入门。
    在这场比赛中，匈牙利队的表演自始至终极为精采，博得观众一致的赞赏。
