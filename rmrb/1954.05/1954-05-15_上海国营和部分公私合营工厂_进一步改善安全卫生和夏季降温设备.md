Shanghai's state-owned and partially joint state-private factories are further improving factory safety and hygiene and summer cooling work. In recent years, thanks to the state's high regard for the working masses, Shanghai's state-owned factories and enterprises have made great improvements in safety and hygiene facilities. By 1953, Shanghai's textile factories had spent 90 billion yuan on improving workshop ventilation, cooling, and safety technology. However, in order to further improve the working conditions of workers, a large amount of funds will still be allocated this year to further improve factory safety and hygiene work. According to a March statistic from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau: the planned expenditure on safety technology measures this year for factories and enterprises in Shanghai under the various industrial ministries of the Central People's Government, including machinery, electrical machinery, iron and steel, shipbuilding, textiles, chemicals, light industry, and electricity, as well as the Shanghai Railway Administration, is approximately 91.8 billion yuan. Among them, Shanghai's textile factories will spend more than 50 billion yuan this year on adding safety and hygiene equipment such as ventilation, cooling, dust extraction, and lighting. The state-owned Shanghai No. 1, 7, and 17 cotton textile factories and the Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory under the East China Textile Administration Bureau will use 11.4 billion yuan in funds this year to add cooling equipment. The Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant will also spend nearly 7 billion yuan to improve workshop cooling equipment. At present, the factories are actively carrying out this work. In order to ensure that the workshop temperature does not affect workers' health when summer arrives, the East China Administrative Committee Labor Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau and Health Bureau, and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions have jointly organized a cooling work research group to assist factories in solving summer cooling work. Certain factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau, which have already made great improvements in cooling equipment, have organized cooling inspection teams. Starting from May 4th, they are conducting cooling measurement inspections at the state-owned Shanghai No. 13 Cotton Textile Factory and are organizing relevant technicians from various state-owned cotton textile factories to participate in order to learn from experience and promote it back in their own factories. This work is expected to be completed by the end of May. After the overhaul is completed, the workshop temperature of the state-owned cotton textile factories can be reduced by another one degree Fahrenheit this summer. In the past, the temperature in the boiler room of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's Shanghai Power Plant often rose to around 120 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest period of summer, which greatly affected the health of workers. In order to solve this problem, they are installing four blowers next to the boiler room and turbine, digging four water wells, installing insulation equipment on each boiler, and striving to achieve complete mechanical ventilation to regulate the workshop temperature. This summer, the workshop temperature of the plant can be reduced to around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private iron and steel factories are also actively carrying out this work. For example, the joint state-private Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 will install three sets of large-scale air shower equipment in two smelting workshops. This summer, the state-owned Asia Iron and Steel Plant will have twenty-four sprayers regulating the air in four high-temperature workshops. The improvement of these facilities will enable workers in Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private factories to engage in production under better safety and hygiene conditions.

    上海国营和部分公私合营工厂
    进一步改善安全卫生和夏季降温设备
    上海各国营和部分公私合营工厂，正进一步改善工厂安全卫生和夏季降温工作。几年来，由于国家对工人群众的高度关怀，上海各国营工厂、企业在安全卫生设施上，都有了很大改善。上海各纺织厂到一九五三年止，用在改善车间通风降温安全技术方面的款项，就有九百亿元。但为了使工人的劳动条件更好，今年仍将拨发大批款项，进一步改善工厂安全卫生工作。据上海市人民政府劳动局三月份统计：中央人民政府各工业部所属上海各机械，电机、钢铁、船舶、纺织、化工、轻工业、电力以及上海铁路管理局等工厂企业，今年的安全技术措施计划经费约九百十八亿元。其中上海各纺织厂今年用在添置通风降温、吸尘、照明等安全卫生设备方面的经费就有五百多亿元。华东纺织管理局所属国营上海第一、七、十七等棉纺织厂和上海第一印染厂，今年将用一百十四亿元资金添置降温设备。上海电力公司发电厂改进车间降温设备费用，也将近七十亿元。目前各厂正积极进行这一工作。为了在夏季到来时，车间温度不致影响工人健康，华东行政委员会劳动局、上海市人民政府劳动局和卫生局以及上海总工会等有关单位已联合组织了降温工作研究组，协助各厂解决夏季降温工作。降温设备已经有了很大改善的华东纺织管理局所属的某些工厂，已组织降温检查组，从五月四日起，在国营上海第十三棉纺织厂进行降温测定检查，并组织各国营棉纺厂有关技术人员参加，以便吸取经验回厂推广。这项工作预计在五月底可全部完成。检修工作完成后，今年夏季各国营棉纺厂的车间温度可再降低华氏一度；上海电力公司上海发电厂，往年每到盛暑时期锅炉房的温度常常上升到华氏一百二十度左右，对工人健康影响很大，为了解决这一问题，他们正在锅炉房，汽轮机旁装置四座鼓风机，打四眼水井，在每座锅炉上都安装隔热设备，并争取做到全部用机械化通风以调节车间温度。今年夏季该厂车间温度可降低到九十五度左右。上海各国营和公私合营钢铁工厂，也在积极进行这一工作。如公私合营上海钢铁一厂将在两个冶炼车间装上三套大型空气淋浴设备。国营亚细亚钢铁厂今年夏季将有二十四架喷雾器分别在四个高温车间里调节空气。这些设备的改善，将使上海各国营和公私合营工厂工人，在更优良的安全卫生条件下从事生产。
