How the Foreman System Was Established in Angang Construction Units
    Fan Rongkang

      Confusion and Distress

    One evening in March 1953, it was almost 11 o'clock. The equipment foundation project of Angang's large rolling mill was entering its final intense stage, and Ma Yuanzhi, the newly transferred director of the First Work Section of the Steelmaking Engineering Company, was still in the office. At this time, a foreman rushed in and said, "Director Ma, go and say something!" Then he began to complain. It turned out that this foreman was responsible for the concrete project of the No. 1 transformer room of the large rolling mill. Only seven cubic meters of concrete was left for this project, and it was planned to finish it at 11 p.m. However, the concrete was delivered a little late, and it was obvious that only a little more than one cubic meter of concrete was left, but the workers were preparing to stop work on time.

    Ma Yuanzhi and the foreman rushed to the construction site of the No. 1 transformer room, and the workers began to shout, "The First Work Section has no work plan," "We can't be blamed for not completing the plan because the concrete is not supplied."

    Ma Yuanzhi said to the workers, "There are many problems with our section's work, and the section is responsible for not completing the plan. But everyone, think about it, only a small amount of project is left, and the loss will be great if we redo it tomorrow!"

    The workers thought for a while and said, "If we continue to work, you should talk to our captain!"

    Where to find the captain in the middle of the night? Finally, they found the dispatch room. After persuasion, the workers continued to pour the remaining concrete.

    Ma Yuanzhi returned to the office, very distressed. He thought, "It's my business if I don't complete the task, what about the workers? The engineering team manages them, and I can't command them, how can I complete the task!"

    At that time, the direct construction organization of the Steelmaking Engineering Company was the work section. In addition to the director of the work section, there were only some technical personnel and management cadres. As for the directly operating workers, they were led by the work-type professional teams parallel to the work section. The dispatch room of the engineering company allocated various workers to each work section, as many as 25 or 26 times a day, with an average of more than 3,000 workers flowing in each work section every day.

    The technicians and foremen in the work section were even more distressed. They were responsible for the specific construction, and it was even more difficult to not have workers under their command. They were entangled in the matter of wanting workers all day long. They were specifically responsible for construction, but they did not have a fixed engineering target. Today they were in charge of this project, and tomorrow they would be in charge of another project. Several foremen were responsible for a single project, but in the end there was no overall person in charge. Sometimes, for a technical problem, the director of the work section would give instructions, the engineer would give opinions, and the technician would have his own ideas, and the foreman did not know who to listen to.

    The captains of the various work-type professional teams also had their own troubles. They only saw that each work section wanted workers, but they did not know which was important and which was secondary, so they could only allocate them according to the order in which they wanted workers. After the allocation, the professional team could not cope with further requests. The professional team was responsible for improving the technical level and labor productivity of the workers, but the workers were scattered on various projects, and the captain did not even know which workers were strong and which were weak, and was not familiar with the project, so there was no way to improve labor productivity. When the superiors asked to launch a labor competition, the captain did not even know the project plan, so the competition could not be launched. In addition, at that time, everyone only cared about wanting workers, and no one considered large-area assembly line operations, which formed the following situation: everyone wanted earthwork workers in the first ten days of each month, steel bar and wood mold workers in the middle ten days, and concrete workers in the last ten days. This easily led to cyclical idling. At this time, it was not the project looking for people, but people looking for projects. It was not the director of the work section or the foreman who was busy, but the engineering captain. What to do? We can only adopt the method of "assigning tasks" and divide the workers among the work sections. It would be good to find some work to do, but if you can't find work, the foreman can only watch the workers idle.

      The chaos in the grassroots organization also brought great distress to the workers. The workers of the Steelmaking Engineering Company used four sentences to describe their distress: unable to calm down, unable to grasp the bottom line, unable to do work, and unable to learn skills. The fact was also true. Today they didn't know where they would be working tomorrow, or what they would be doing. After going to work every day, they would first wait to be assigned to the work section, and then wait for the assignment of tasks. After the tasks were assigned, they would go back to the team to collect tools. After collecting the tools, they would wait for other work types to create construction conditions (such as concrete workers waiting for carpenters to build scaffolding). In one day, they would have to wait seven or eight times, which would always delay one or two hours. When they started working, it was also a mess, they couldn't learn skills, they couldn't do work, and they couldn't calculate wages by piece.

    The same distress also surrounded the comrades of each work section of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company.

    The problem was very obvious, and all the problems were caused by the chaos in the grassroots organization. This chaos was mainly manifested in two problems: one was the separation of labor organization and construction organization, and the separation of technical leadership and administrative leadership; the other was that no one was specifically responsible for a single project. This made it impossible for the one-chief system in basic construction to be reflected in the grassroots organization, the workers and the director of the work section became employment relationships, no one was responsible for a single project, and progress, quality, and economic accounting could not be guaranteed.

      Took the First Step

    Last April, Angang's basic construction department launched a movement to establish a responsibility system. Therefore, the issue of rectifying the grassroots organization was raised.

    In May last year, the First Work Section of the Steelmaking Engineering Company led by Ma Yuanzhi and various work-type professional teams agreed on a method: according to the needs of the project, each professional team would allocate a part of the construction force to be controlled by the First Work Section, and the director of the work section and the leading cadres sent to the First Work Section by the professional team would form a command group to reduce the flow of workers and unify the leadership of construction.

    In June, the Third Work Section of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company, which was undertaking the equipment foundation project of the thin plate factory, implemented the basic responsibility system.

    The basic responsibility system divided each equipment foundation project into several sections according to the size of the project, the complexity of the technical standards, and the regional distribution, and then assigned the foremen to each section to be responsible for a certain project, so that the entire construction of the equipment foundation, from setting out, digging, to pouring, was the responsibility of a special person to the end. The construction workers were organized into special responsible construction teams or squads according to work types, and were responsible from the beginning of construction until completion. The basic responsibility system reflected the principle of production area management, implemented the one-chief system into the grassroots organization, so that each project had a special person in charge, each foreman had a fixed construction object, and the mobility of workers was greatly reduced.

    The basic responsibility system changed the face of the Third Work Section of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company. The Third Work Section started the construction of the thin plate factory project in April, but had not completed the task for two months, and an accident occurred in the iron slag pit project, which was severely criticized as a typical example of no one being responsible. After the implementation of the basic responsibility system in June, the situation of not being able to complete the task was reversed, and the number of quality rework accidents was also reduced.

    Later, this responsibility system was expanded to chimneys, bricklaying, precast concrete slabs, and other projects, and the basic responsibility system was developed into a single project special responsibility system.

    However, whether it was the command group of the First Work Section of the Steelmaking Engineering Company, or the basic responsibility system of the Third Work Section of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company, they were only temporary measures for single projects, and did not fundamentally negate the old organizational form of the separation of construction organization and labor organization, and the separation of technical leadership and administrative leadership. The workers still belonged to the professional team, and the foreman could not convene joint meetings of various work types even if he wanted to. After a single project was completed, the workers would return to their respective teams. Although a new command group could be reorganized for a new single project, and it could continue to be reorganized according to the principle of the single project special responsibility system, it was another group of strangers who met together.

    At that time, when discussing the issue of rectifying the grassroots organization, there were still very divergent opinions. The Steelmaking Engineering Company had three opinions. Some people believed that the parallel organizational form of the work section and the professional team should be retained, as long as the work section strengthened plan management. Some people believed that the work section should be abolished and the professional team should be strengthened. Others advocated abolishing the professional team and fixing the workers in the work section.

    While everyone's opinions were divided and their arguments differed, Angang Iron and Steel Company announced the Soviet experts' suggestions on improving the grassroots construction organization, which unified everyone's understanding. Soviet experts suggested implementing the foreman system, setting up several foremen under the director of the work section, and repeatedly elaborated on the principles of improving the grassroots construction organization. First, to organically organize the grassroots organization according to the principle of production area management; second, to fix the workers as much as possible; and third, the foreman is the basic link to complete the state plan.

      Implementing the Foreman System

    Starting from July last year, the Steelmaking Engineering Company and the Rolling Mill Engineering Company abolished the engineering professional teams, fixed the workers in the work section (and further fixed the workers in the section—work area), and implemented the foreman system. The two engineering companies did not completely same in practice. The Steelmaking Engineering Company set up foremen under the director of the work section, responsible for all the projects in a section (work area). Under the foreman, there were squads set up according to work types, and under the squads were the workers' shifts and groups; the Rolling Mill Engineering Company set up a general foreman under the director of the work section, and under the general foreman, there were foremen responsible for one or several single projects. The workers working on this single project were directly commanded by the foreman responsible for the construction of that single project. But despite these differences, the two companies organized the grassroots organization according to the principle of production area management, fixed the basic workers on the project, and implemented the one-chief system into the grassroots construction organization through the foreman system.

    The first obstacle encountered in implementing the foreman system was still the issue of ideological understanding. Some engineers were very dissatisfied after being appointed as foremen. Some complained, "I came from East China to Northeast China to support Angang, but I didn't expect to be a foreman." Some technical personnel used to say, "There is a position but no power." Now that they are foremen, they simply understand construction management as administrative affairs, and they don't want to do it for fear of becoming "jacks of all trades." Foremen promoted from workers were also worried that their cultural level was low and their management ability was poor, and they couldn't even understand the drawings, so they were afraid they couldn't be foremen.

    The second obstacle encountered in implementing the foreman system was that there was no clear foreman responsibility system at the beginning, and there were still many places where the division of labor was unclear and the responsibilities were unclear, and the foremen were in a state of chaos. This further shook their confidence in the foreman system. When the foreman Wang Shixuan of the Steelmaking Engineering Company's large rolling mill construction site was brushing cold asphalt for the waterproof project of a certain oil depot, he went to collect tools as soon as he went to work, and took the workers to carry cold asphalt, and instructed the carpenters to repair the scaffolding, collect thermometers, borrow scales, borrow bowls, issue notes for the workers to collect work clothes, and find an inspection station to inspect. He was busy with this and that, and two groups of workers didn't know what to do until 8:30. By 10 o'clock, they had not started working. Several temporary oil workers had to go off work at 10:30 because they were going to eat health food.

    In the process of implementing the foreman system, the Rolling Mill Engineering Company and the Steelmaking Engineering Company convened special meetings to clarify everyone's wrong understanding of the foreman system, and launched the foremen to discuss and initially formulate the foreman responsibility system. The two engineering companies also focused on the training of foremen.

    The main problem for foremen from technical personnel is how to combine with workers. The foreman system itself puts forward the requirement of close integration of labor and technology, and only the combination of labor and technology can implement the foreman system; and the foreman system itself has prepared favorable organizational conditions for the combination of labor and technology, changing the situation that technical personnel cannot control workers, but whether the foremen from technical personnel can combine with workers depends on their own efforts. Angang mainly helped the foremen from technical personnel to do two things well in this regard. One was to hold some heart-to-heart talks between technical personnel and workers to eliminate misunderstandings, and the other was to launch the foremen from technical personnel to seriously carry out technical briefings. Some foremen from technical personnel continued to do technical briefings until the workers were completely clear. Some also went to the site to combine engineering briefings.

    The main problem for foremen promoted from workers is how to improve their technical level (first of all, to understand the drawings) and management level. Most of the foremen promoted from workers are enthusiastic and proactive in this regard. Some brought drawings to the site to familiarize themselves with the drawings in combination with the site construction, and at the same time ensured construction according to the drawings, but some believed that "it is shameful to carry drawings to construction." Angang gave patient help to the foremen promoted from workers in this regard. The Rolling Mill Engineering Company held a foreman spare time study class, using a part of the early rest time to organize engineers and general foremen with higher technical levels to give lectures to the foremen according to the current engineering construction situation and the technical knowledge that the foremen urgently need to master in their leadership work. After the work section announced the weekly work plan, it also held a technical research meeting to help the foremen solve various difficulties in their work, which were welcomed by the foremen promoted from workers. It is also an effective system. When the Rolling Mill Engineering Company implemented the foreman system, among the 52 full-time and deputy foremen, except for 10 who could read drawings, the remaining 42 foremen could not read drawings. Some could not even match the plan view and the profile view, but by the end of October, except for 6 who still could not read drawings, the rest could read general drawings, and some of them could read more complex drawings.

    Before the Rolling Mill Engineering Company and the Steelmaking Engineering Company implemented the foreman system, the mechanical installation engineering company, the electrical installation engineering company and other professional construction units of Angang Iron and Steel Company, which were of the nature of second-level contracting, also implemented the foreman system according to the principle of production area management. I have visited many engineering company managers, work section directors, and foremen, and asked them to talk about what benefits the foreman system has brought. Everyone believes that the foreman system is an important principle of the grassroots organization of basic construction, and the implementation of plan management, technical guidance, and economic accounting has been guaranteed since the implementation of the foreman system. All the difficulties and disputes caused by the separation of construction organization and labor organization, and the separation of technical leadership and administrative leadership have ended, the phenomenon of no one being responsible and unable to be responsible has been reduced, and the grassroots construction organization has truly become a fighting unit as a whole. The foremen are free from the affairs of requesting and transferring workers from the professional team, and truly delve into the construction, grasp the work plan, and technical briefings, organize the construction, and implement the policy of good, fast, economical, and safe. After the workers are fixed to the foremen, the work area's plan becomes the workers' own plan, the concept of completing the plan is greatly strengthened, and labor productivity is significantly improved. In the past, the second work section of the Steelmaking Engineering Company used to lay 180 bricks per worker, but later it was increased to 600 bricks. After the concrete workers went to work, they saw that the transportation line was not paved, and they did it themselves without waiting for the carpenters. A new atmosphere has appeared on the construction site.

    鞍钢施工单位的工长制是怎样建立起来的
    范荣康
      混乱和苦恼
    一九五三年三月里的一个晚上，快十一点钟了。鞍钢大型轧钢厂的设备基础工程正进入最后的紧张阶段，新调来的炼钢工程公司一工段主任马元智还留在办公室里。这时，一个领工员匆匆忙忙地闯进来说：“马主任，你去说说吧！”接着他就诉起苦来。原来这个领工员是负责大型轧钢厂一号变压器室混凝土工程的。这个工程只剩下七立方公尺的混凝土工程量了，计划在晚间十一点打完。可是，混凝土送迟了些，眼看就只差一立方公尺多一些的混凝土，工人们却准备按时收工了。
    马元智和领工员赶到一号变压器室工地，工人们就嚷开了：“一工段工作没计划”，“混凝土供不上，完不成计划不能怪我们”。
    马元智对工人们说：“我们段上的工作是有很多毛病，完不成计划是要由段上负责的。可是大家想一想，只剩下不多工程了，明天重打，损失多大啊！”
    工人们想了想说：“是不是继续干下去，你们找咱们队长吧！”
    深更半夜那儿去找队长呢？最后找到调度室，经过动员说服，工人才继续把剩下的混凝土打完。
    马元智回到办公室里，非常苦恼，他想：“完不成任务是我的事，工人呢？工程队管着，我指挥不动，叫我拿什么来完成任务啊！”
    炼钢工程公司当时直接施工的组织是工段。工段除了工段主任外，就只有一些技术人员和管理干部，至于直接操作的工人是由与工段平行的工种专业队领导的，工程公司的调度室为各工段调配各种工人，每天达二十五、六次，平均每天有三千名以上的工人在各工段流动。
    工段里的技术员、领工员的苦恼更大，他们是具体施工的负责者，不掌握工人、不能指挥工人更是寸步难行，一天到晚也都纠缠在要工人的事情上。他们是具体负责施工的，可是却没有固定的工程对象，今天管这一项，明天又去管另一项。一个单项工程有好几个领工员负过责，最后却没有总的负责人。有时候，一个技术问题，工段主任指示一通，工程师提一阵意见，技术员又是一个主张，领工员不知听谁的好。
    各工种专业队的队长也有自己的苦恼。只见各个工段都要工人，不知那个重要，那个次要，只能根据要工人的先后次序分配。分完了，再来要，专业队就应付不了。专业队要负责提高工人的技术水平和劳动生产率，可是工人散在各项工程上，队长连哪个工人强、哪个工人弱都不知道，又不熟悉工程，提高劳动生产率就无从下手，上级叫展开劳动竞赛，队长连工程计划都不知道，赛不起来。再加上那时候大家只顾要工人，大区域的流水作业无人考虑，就形成这样一种情况：每月上旬大家都要挖土工，中旬都要钢筋木模工，下旬都要混凝土工。这就容易发生周期性的窝工。到这种时候，不是工程找人，而是人找工程了，忙乱的不是工段主任，领工员，而是工程队长了。怎么办呢？只能采取“分配任务”的办法，把工人分摊到工段里去。能找到点活儿还好，要找不到活儿，领工员也只能眼巴巴地看着工人窝工。
      基层组织的混乱也给工人带来莫大的苦恼。炼钢工程公司的工人们有四句话形容自己的苦恼：沉不下气，摸不着底，干不出活来，学不到手艺。事实也正是如此，今天不知道明天在那里干，干什么，每天上了班先是等着分到工段去，到了工段再等分配任务，分下任务回队去领工具，领了工具又等别的工种创造施工条件（如混凝土工等木工搭跳板），一天里七等八等的，总要耽搁一两个钟头，干起活来也是乱七八糟的，学不到手艺，活儿也干不出来，工资没法计件。
    同样的苦恼也包围着轧钢工程公司各工段的同志们。
    问题非常明显，一切毛病都出在基层组织的混乱上。这种混乱主要表现在两个问题上：一个是劳动组织和施工组织分裂，技术领导和行政领导分裂；一个是单项工程没有专人负责。这就使基本建设中的一长制不能体现在基层组织中，工人和工段主任变成雇佣关系，单项工程无人负责，进度、质量和经济核算都无法保证。
      迈开了第一步
    去年四月，鞍钢基本建设部门开展了建立责任制的运动。于是，整顿基层组织的问题被提出来了。
    去年五月里，马元智领导的炼钢工程公司一工段和各工种专业队商定了一种办法：根据工程需要，各专业队调拨一部分施工力量，归一工段掌握，由工段主任和专业队派到一工段的领导干部成立指挥小组，减少工人的流动，统一施工的领导。
    到了六月份，承建薄板厂设备基础工程的轧钢工程公司三工段实行了基础责任制。
    基础责任制是把各个设备基础工程按照工程量的大小，技术标准的繁简以及区域分布情况，划分成若干分段，然后把领工员分配在各个分段，对一定的工程负责，使整个设备基础的施工，从放线、挖土到浇灌都由专人负责到底。施工工人则按工种组成专责施工组或队，从开始施工一直负责到完工。基础责任制体现了生产区域管理制的原则，把一长制贯彻到基层组织中去，使每项工程都有专人负责，每个领工员都有固定的施工对象，工人的流动性也大大减少。
    基础责任制改变了轧钢工程公司三工段的面貌。三工段是在四月份开始薄板厂工程的施工的，但开工两个月一直没有完成任务，并发生了铁渣坑工程事故，被当作无人负责的典型受到严厉批判，六月份实行基础责任制后，扭转了完不成任务的局面，质量返工事故也减少了。
    后来，这种责任制又扩大到烟囱、砌砖、预制板等工程上，基础责任制就发展成单项工程专责制。
    但是，不论是炼钢工程公司一工段的指挥小组，不论是轧钢工程公司三工段的基础责任制，都只是单项工程上的临时措施，并未从根本上否定施工组织与劳动组织分裂，技术领导与行政领导分裂的旧的组织形式。工人还是属于专业队的，领工员想召集各工种的联合会议也召集不起来，一个单项工程完了，工人也就各自归队，新的单项工程虽可重新组织指挥小组，虽可继续按单项工程专责制的原则重新组织，但碰在一起的又是另一批彼此陌生的人了。
    当时，在讨论整顿基层组织的问题时，意见还是非常分歧的。炼钢工程公司就有三种意见。一种人认为要保留工段和专业队平行的组织形式，只要工段加强计划管理就行了，一种人认为应该取消工段，把专业队加强起来，还有一种人主张取消专业队，把工人固定在工段。
    正在大家意见纷纷，其说不一的时候，鞍山钢铁公司公布了苏联专家关于改进基层施工组织的建议，才把大家的认识统一起来。苏联专家建议实行工长制，在工段主任下设工长若干名，并反复阐述改进基层施工组织的原则，第一是以生产区域管理制的原则把基层机构有机地组织起来，第二是尽一切可能使工人固定化，第三是工长是完成国家计划的基本环节。
      实行工长制
    从去年七月份开始，炼钢工程公司，轧钢工程公司都取消了工程专业队，把工人固定在工段（后来并进一步把工人固定到分段——工区），实行工长制。在做法上两个工程公司不完全相同。炼钢工程公司是在工段主任下设工长，负责一个分段（工区）的全部工程，工长下按工种设立小队，小队下是工人的班、组；轧钢工程公司是在工段主任下设总工长，总工长下设工长，负责一个或几个单项工程，在这单项工程中施工的工人直接由负责该单项工程施工的工长指挥。但尽管有这些不同，两个公司却同样地按照生产区域管理制的原则，把基层机构组织起来，同样使基本工人固定在工程上，同样通过工长制，使一长制的原则体现在基层施工组织上。
    实行工长制，最初遇到的障碍还是思想认识问题。一些工程师被任命为工长后大为不满，有的埋怨说：“从华东赶到东北来，支援鞍钢，想不到让我当个工头。”一些技术人员过去只说：“有职无权”，现在当了工长，却又把施工管理简单化地理解为行政事务，不愿干，怕变成“万金油”。工人中提拔上来的工长又顾虑文化水平低，管理能力差，图纸都看不懂，怕当不了。
    实行工长制遇到的第二个障碍是最初还没有明确的工长责任制，分工不明，职责不清的地方还不少，工长陷于忙乱状态。这就更动摇了他们对工长制的信心。炼钢工程公司大型轧钢厂工地某号油库防水工程刷冷沥青时，工长王世选一上班就去领工具，又带着工人去挑冷沥青，又指挥木工修理脚手架，领温度计、借秤、借碗，开条给工人去领工作服，找检查站检查，忙来忙去，顾了这顾不了那，两组工人到八点半钟还不知道干什么，等到十点钟还没有开始干，临时调来的几个油工因为要去吃保健饭，十点半钟就要下班了。
    在实行工长制的过程中，轧钢工程公司和炼钢工程公司都曾召集了专门会议，来澄清大家对工长制的错误认识，并发动工长讨论和初步制订了工长责任制。两个工程公司并特别着重进行了工长的培养工作。
    技术人员出身的工长，主要是应该解决一个如何和工人结合的问题。工长制本身提出了劳技密切结合的要求，只有劳技结合才能贯彻工长制；而工长制本身又已为劳技结合准备了组织上的有利条件，改变了技术人员管不着工人的局面，但技术人员出身的工长能不能和工人相结合，还要看自己的努力。鞍钢在这方面主要是帮助技术人员出身的工长做好了两件工作。一件是分别开了一些技术人员和工人的谈心会，消除隔阂，一件是发动技术人员出身的工长认真进行技术交底，有些技术人员出身的工长在技术交底中一直做到使工人完全明了为止。有的还到现场去结合工程交底。
    工人中提拔的工长主要是应该解决如何提高技术水平（首先是看懂图纸）和管理水平的问题。大多数工人中提拔的工长在这方面是热情和主动的，有的带了图纸到现场去，一方面结合现场建筑去熟悉图纸，一方面又保证了按图施工，但也有的认为“带着图纸去施工，多丢人”。鞍钢在这方面给工人中提拔的工长以耐心的帮助。轧钢工程公司举办了工长业余学习班，利用早休一部分时间，组织工程师与技术水平较高的总工长，根据当前工程施工情况和工长在领导工作上急须掌握的技术知识，向工长讲课，在工段宣布每周的作业计划后，又召开技术研究会，帮助工长解决工作中的各种困难，这都是受到工人中提拔的工长欢迎的。也是有效的制度。轧钢工程公司实行工长制时，五十二个正副工长中，除十个会看图纸外，其余四十二名工长都不会看图纸，有的连平面图、剖面图都对不起来，但到十月底时，除还有六名不会看图纸外，其余都会看一般的图纸，其中有一部分还能看较复杂的图纸。
    在轧钢工程工司、炼钢工程公司实行工长制以前，鞍山钢铁公司的机械安装工程公司，电气安装工程公司等二包性质的专业施工单位，也都按生产区域管理制的原则实行了工长制。我曾访问了许多工程公司的经理、工段主任和工长，请他们谈谈工长制带来些什么好处，所有的人在回答我的问题时，都认为工长制是基本建设基层组织的重要原则，计划管理、技术指导和经济核算的贯彻，都从工长制的实行取得了保证。一切由于施工组织和劳动组织分裂，技术领导和行政领导分裂所产生的困难和纠纷结束了，无人负责和无法负责的现象减少了，基层施工组织真正成为一个整体的战斗单位。工长们免去了往专业队请调工人等事务，真正钻到施工中去，抓住作业计划，技术交底，把施工组织起来，贯彻好、快、省和安全的方针。工人固定给工长后，工区的计划就变成工人自己的计划，完成计划的观念大大加强了，劳动生产率显著提高，炼钢工程公司二工段以前每工砌砖一百八十块，后来提高到六百块，混凝土工上班后，看见运输线路没有铺好，不等木工来，自己就干了。工地上出现了一片新气象。
