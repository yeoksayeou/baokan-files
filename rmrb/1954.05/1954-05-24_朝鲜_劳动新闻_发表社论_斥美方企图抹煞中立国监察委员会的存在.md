Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd - The "Labor News" published an editorial on the 22nd, condemning the US delegation's distribution in Geneva on the 17th of a statement distorting facts by the Swedish and Swiss members of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, with the aim of creating obstacles to the Geneva Conference.

The editorial pointed out: The United States has consistently and tyrannically violated the Armistice Agreement, illegally importing large quantities of combat weapons and military supplies, while also vigorously expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army. In order to restrict and obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection teams, the United States has even insulted, coerced, beaten, and abducted members of the inspection teams. Now, the United States is using the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to issue this false statement, which clearly proves the United States' attempt to further create instability in the Korean armistice.

The editorial continued: Another purpose of the United States in slandering and threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to attempt to undermine the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. As everyone knows, in his speech on May 14th at the Geneva Conference regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina, Foreign Minister Molotov suggested that, in order to assist both parties in fulfilling the terms of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, a neutral nations supervisory commission should be established. Foreign Minister Molotov's suggestion is a practical and feasible plan to promote the resolution of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. Precisely at this time, the US delegation in Geneva distorted and slandered the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, attempting to undermine the positive significance of the Soviet delegation's supplementary proposal and disrupt the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

The editorial said: However, no amount of slander and libel by US imperialism can cover up the truth. In assisting in the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has done much useful work, proving that this institution can play a positive role under the condition that both parties strictly abide by the Armistice Agreement. The problem lies in the fact that the US side has arrogantly violated the Armistice Agreement, and the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have lost their original impartiality and distorted the facts to defend the US side's violations of the Armistice Agreement.

The editorial pointed out: Now, the US side's provocative actions in attempting to undermine the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and to sabotage the Geneva Conference, which is tasked with the peaceful resolution of the Korean and Indochinese issues, have aroused the anger of the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world, and will be resolutely opposed by the people of all countries.

    斥美方企图抹煞中立国监察委员会的存在
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】“劳动新闻”二十二日发表社论，斥责美国代表团十七日在日内瓦散发朝鲜中立国监察委员会瑞典和瑞士委员歪曲事实的声明，目的在于给日内瓦会议制造障碍。
    社论指出：美国一贯横暴地违反停战协定，非法地运入大量的作战武器和军用物资，同时并竭力扩张李承晚伪军。美国为了限制和阻挠中立国监察委员会视察小组的工作，甚至侮辱、胁迫、殴打和劫持视察小组的人员。现在美国又利用中立国监察委员会瑞士和瑞典委员来发表这个虚伪的声明，这清楚地证明了美国企图进一步造成朝鲜停战的不稳定状态。
    社论接着说：美国诽谤和威胁中立国监察委员会的另一个目的，是企图在日内瓦会议上破坏印度支那问题的和平解决。众所周知，莫洛托夫外长五月十四日在日内瓦会议上发表的关于恢复印度支那和平问题的演说中，建议为协助双方履行停止敌对行动的协定的条款，应规定建立中立国监督委员会。莫洛托夫外长的这一建议，是促进恢复印度支那和平问题的解决的切实可行的方案。恰恰在这个时候，日内瓦的美国代表团歪曲和诽谤朝鲜的中立国监察委员会的工作，企图损害苏联代表团的补充建议的肯定意义，破坏印度支那问题的和平解决。
    社论说：但是，美帝国主义的任何诽谤中伤也不能掩盖事实的真相。在协助履行朝鲜停战协定中，中立国监察委员会进行了许多有益的工作，证明了这一机构在双方严格遵守停战协定的条件下，是能够起肯定的作用的。问题在于美方狂妄地违反停战协定，中立国监察委员会瑞典和瑞士委员丧失了自己本来的公正性，并歪曲事实为美方违反停战协定的行为辩护。
    社论指出：现在，美方企图破坏中立国监察委员会的存在，并企图破坏以和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题为使命的日内瓦会议的挑衅行为，激起了朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒，并将遭到各国人民的坚决反对。
