    [Our Newspaper] During the spring planting season, grain departments in various localities actively strengthened the planned grain supply work in rural areas.
    Since the beginning of spring, grain departments in various localities, on the basis of implementing planned grain supply, have promptly improved grain supply organizations, improved supply methods, and increased the amount of grain supplied. In Shaanxi Province, more than 800 new grain supply points have been added in towns and villages this year. Hebei Province now has approximately 3,500 grain supply points, allowing the masses to purchase grain nearby. In Hunan, Hebei, and other provinces, many grain supply points have implemented a "continuous shift system," allowing farmers to purchase grain in the morning and evening. In Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing County, Xiaoshan County, and other adjacent areas have broken down administrative divisions and supplied grain according to farmers' purchasing habits. In Anhui Province, Dingyuan County and other areas organized farmers to buy grain collectively by mutual aid teams or electoral districts. These measures have played a significant role in saving farmers' time for spring planting.
    Grain departments in various localities have vigorously supplied grain to economic crop areas and disaster areas. From January to April, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau transported 305.94 million catties of corn, sorghum, and other miscellaneous grains to the three major cotton-producing areas of Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Huimin; it also transported 148.4 million catties of grain to the two peanut-producing areas of Wendeng and Laiyang. Each county in the Handan Special District of Hebei Province further investigated the grain needs of farmers and supplied grain based on actual needs, greatly encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for cotton planting. The Wu Lingyun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wu Tun Village, Qiu County, originally planned to plant 180 mu of cotton, but now planted 230 mu. In disaster areas such as Shangshui County in Henan Province, the grain departments not only fully supplied the affected people with food grain, but also supplied a large number of grain seeds. For rural flour mills, tofu shops, cooked food businesses, hotels, and mule and horse inns, grain departments in various localities also supplied grain in a planned manner according to their business conditions. In many areas of North China, grain departments and cooperatives also adopted the method of signing "triangular contracts" with flour mills, tofu shops, and farmers raising pigs, with the state supplying the flour mills and tofu shops with raw grain and the workshops supplying farmers with non-staple foods and pig feed.
    In coordination with the state's vigorous supply of grain, various localities actively established state-managed rural primary grain markets. According to incomplete statistics from 20 provinces across the country, as of early May, 12,513 primary grain markets have been established. In the rural towns of East China, 662 grain markets have been established. Currently, many markets are trading around 1,000 catties of grain per day or per fair. The Zhangqiu market in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, and other markets trade more than 5,000 catties of grain per fair. Through the state grain market, farmers can sell surplus grain to expand production investment, mutually adjust grain varieties, and buy some food grain, seeds, and feed. Rural tofu shops, flour mills, and other businesses can also buy some raw materials. This has played a significant role in invigorating the primary market, supporting spring planting production, and assisting the state's grain supply work.
    The state's vigorous efforts to strengthen planned grain supply have fully met the needs of grain in various rural areas during the spring planting season. At the same time, during this "lean season," grain prices have remained stable. This has powerfully supported the smooth progress of spring planting production.

    各地加强农村粮食计划供应
    有力地支持了春耕生产的顺利进行
   【本报讯】各地粮食部门在春耕生产期间，积极加强农村粮食计划供应工作。
    入春以来，各地粮食部门在实行粮食计划供应的基础上，及时健全了粮食供应机构，改进了供应办法，增加了粮食供应数量。陕西省各地集镇和广大农村，今年新增设的粮食供应点有八百多处。河北全省现已设立粮食供应点约三千五百个，群众一般都可以就近买到粮食。湖南、河北等地不少粮食供应点实行了“连带上班制”，使农民早晚都能买到粮食；浙江省绍兴县和萧山县等许多接壤地区打破行政区划，按照农民购粮习惯供应粮食；安徽省定远县等组织农民按互助组或选区集体买粮。这些办法对节省农民春耕时间起了不小作用。
    对经济作物区及灾区需要的粮食，各地粮食部门都大力进行了供应。一月到四月间，山东省人民政府粮食厅运到棉花主要产地聊城、德州、惠民三个专区的玉米、高粱等杂粮，就有三亿零五百九十四万斤；运到花生产地文登、莱阳两专区的粮食，有一亿四千八百四十万斤。河北省邯郸专区各县都进一步调查了农民需要粮食的情况，根据实际需要，进行供应，大大鼓舞了农民的植棉情绪。邱县吴屯村吴灵云农业生产合作社原来计划种一百八十亩棉花，现在种了二百三十亩。河南省商水县等灾区的粮食部门除充分供应灾民口粮外，还供应了大批粮种。对于农村粉坊、豆腐坊、熟食业、旅店、骡马店等，各地粮食部门也都按照其营业情况，有计划地供应了粮食。华北许多地区的粮食部门和合作社还采用和粉坊、豆腐坊及饲养毛猪农户订“三角合同”的办法，由国家供给粉坊、豆腐坊原料粮，由作坊供给农民副食品及养猪饲料。
    配合国家大力供应粮食的工作，各地积极建立了国家管理的农村初级粮食市场。据全国二十个省的不完全统计，截至五月初，已建立一万二千五百一十三个初级粮食市场。华东区农村集镇已设立六百六十二个粮食市场，目前许多市场每天或每集成交的粮食都在一千斤左右；山东省寿张县张秋等市场逢集成交的粮食还在五千斤以上。通过国家粮食市场，农民可以出售余粮，扩大生产投资，可以互相调剂粮食品种，可以买到一部分口粮、种籽和饲料，农村豆腐坊、粉坊等也可以买到一部分原料，这对活跃初级市场，支持春耕生产，以及辅助国家粮食供应工作都起了很大作用。
    国家大力加强粮食计划供应工作，充分满足了各地农村春耕生产期间对粮食的需要。同时，在这“青黄不接”的时候，粮价也一直保持稳定。这就有力地支持了春耕生产的顺利进行。
