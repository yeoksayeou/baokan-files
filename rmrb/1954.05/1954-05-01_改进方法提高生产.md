    Improve Methods to Increase Production
    Fu Jingwen, Special-Class Labor Model of Wuhan City
    I implemented the assembly line method in my sewing work at the clothing factory and received praise and rewards. I feel very honored and excited to visit the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' technical innovation exhibition in the capital this time, and to have the opportunity to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration in the capital.
    The assembly line method for sewing work involves dividing a set of clothes into dozens of processes, with one person sewing one seam. This was successfully tested in Workshop 7 of our factory in October 1951.
    At that time, I had just become the workshop director. The original workshop director had been transferred, and half of the skilled workers had also been transferred away. The newly arrived workers were not skilled and had never operated the electric sewing machines in our factory. Production decreased by half, and the quality was not good, with the pass rate dropping from 96 percent to 90 percent. The task was also pressing, and on the one hand, several thousand semi-finished products were piled up in the workshop, making it impossible to walk; on the other hand, there was idle work. The new workers with poor skills were overwhelmed by the workload, while the old workers doing the next process worked for a while and then rested, complaining when they rested. Everyone in the workshop had a bitter face.
    During that time, I walked around the workshop, watching carefully, and talking to the workers. I found that the reason for the decline in production was not only the new workers, whose skills could not keep up, but more importantly, the production was not well organized. Although everyone only worked on a part of the clothes, this part was complicated enough. Taking pocket digging as an example, there were visible stitches, hidden stitches, turning and folding, attaching pocket welts, sewing edges, and knotting. There were many processes, making the work very difficult; in addition, some workers were skilled at sewing visible stitches but not good at knotting, or good at knotting but not good at sewing visible stitches, which delayed many things. If we implemented assembly line operations and specialized work, with people specializing in visible stitches, and others specializing in attaching pocket welts, the entire production process of a set of clothes could be finely divided into many processes, flowing down like a line, making each worker's job very simple and specialized, then wouldn't production be sure to increase? Wouldn't quality be guaranteed?
    During the day, I watched in the workshop, and at night, I went home to draw diagrams. I divided a set of clothes into more than eighty processes, and according to the size and difficulty of the projects, I assigned the machines in the workshop to each process. After arranging everything properly, I discussed it with Shang Wanxin, the deputy secretary of the Party branch and foreman, and another foreman, Fan Chunhe. I also held a Party branch committee meeting and reported my plan, and everyone agreed. To prevent chaos when the whole workshop started at once, it was decided to start the experiment with Zhang Dianying's team and then promote it universally from point to area.
    Zhang Dianying was a straightforward old worker. When we talked to him, he said, "It won't work! Fast and slow workers are mixed together, there's no way to do it, and how will wages be paid?"
    Wages were indeed a problem. With the processes divided so finely, there were no such fine wage quotas. However, we couldn't abandon the assembly line operation because of this. We persuaded Zhang Dianying and mobilized the workers in his team. The next morning, we made some preparations, and in the afternoon, Zhang Dianying's team began the experiment. In the first hour or so, the experiment did not go well. Four of the eight people could not receive the work from the previous step, and some people shouted, "I told you it wouldn't work!" "I've never seen work done like this in decades of work." I wasn't worried because I was confident. I asked the masses to hold a meeting to find the reasons and found two: one was that the labor force was not properly allocated, with fast workers being assigned easy work and difficult work falling into the hands of slow workers, causing uneven speed; the other was that the process division was not appropriate and not smooth. The next day, the labor force was re-allocated and the processes were re-divided. The output did not increase or decrease. On the third day, the output increased by more than ten percent, and on the fourth day, the output increased by more than twenty percent. The assembly line experiment was a success, and everyone was happy.
    Then we held a meeting of all the team leaders in the workshop, and Zhang Dianying gave a typical report on the implementation of the assembly line operation. We started to promote the assembly line operation in the entire workshop. The factory director and the Party branch secretary supported us and helped us. In about a month and a half, the entire workshop implemented the assembly line operation. By January 1952, the three-month production task was completed three days ahead of schedule, and more than 5,000 additional pieces were produced. The phenomenon of halving production was reversed, and the productivity also increased by 26 percent. With the specialization of work, the workers also made many rationalization proposals and invented many special tools.
    As production improved, management work could not keep up. The first problem was wages. Without detailed quotas, wages could not be calculated. We drafted our own quota plan and let the workers discuss and pass it. Then the receiving and dispatching could not keep up. I had also worked in receiving and dispatching before. That work was tiring. Hundreds of workers came to receive and hand in work, filling out cards. Sometimes there was a large group of people in front of me, the work could not be issued, the workers waited there, and at night they could only work overtime to sort out the materials and prepare for the next day's distribution. After the implementation of the assembly line operation, the workers were fixed in their own processes, flowing down one by one. Who would fill out the cards and keep the accounts! After studying with the receiving and dispatching personnel, I came up with a work order form, which was passed down from the first process, and the workers filled in their own codes, which solved the problem. The original two receiving and dispatching staff members were reduced by one, and the work was not chaotic.
    In this way, the manual operation method of sewing production in Workshop 7 was completely changed, and the entire production process was organized according to the method of large-scale production. Later, this assembly line method was promoted in many clothing factories across the country, as well as in shoe factories, etc. I was named a special-class labor model in Wuhan City and was promoted to deputy section chief of the production section in the factory.
    Some time ago, the assembly line method for sewing work took another step forward, with the installation of an electric conveyor belt, which further improved labor productivity.
    My achievements in technical innovation are still very small, and these achievements have also been made with the help of the Party and the masses. After visiting the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' technical innovation exhibition, and seeing the many inventions and creations of the Anshan workers, I feel that there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in the face of the working class. The potential is inexhaustible, and I must make more efforts after returning. For example, the main conveyor belt in our factory has not yet been resolved. I think this problem can also be solved with the existing equipment. I must mobilize everyone to solve it after returning.

    改进方法提高生产
    武汉市特等劳动模范　傅景文
    我在被服厂的缝纫工作中推行了流水作业法，受到了表扬与奖励。这次到首都来参观鞍钢技术革新展览会，并且有机会参加首都的“五一”国际劳动节庆祝大会，我感到非常光荣和兴奋。
    缝纫工作的流水作业法，是把一套衣服分成几十个工序，一人缝一道线。这是一九五一年十月，我在我们工厂七车间试验成功的。
    那时候，我刚当车间主任，原来的车间主任调走了，技术工人也调走一半，新来的工人技术不熟练，又没有操作过我们厂里的电动缝纫机，产量降低了一半，质量也不好，合格率从百分之九十六下降到百分之九十。任务又催得紧，车间里一方面半成品积压了几千件，塞得连路也走不通，一方面又窝工。技术差的新工人给活压得喘不过气来，而在他下一个工序干活的老工人干一阵，歇一阵，歇下来就怨开了。车间里大家都苦着脸。
    那阵，我在车间里走来走去，细细地看，和工人们谈，发现产量降低的原因，不只是换上新的工人，技术赶不上，更重要的还在于生产组织得不好，每个人虽然只干衣服的一部分，就这一部分也是够复杂的。拿挖兜来说，有明线，有暗线，翻来折去，上兜牙，缝口，打结，工序很多，做活很费劲；再加上有的工人明线缝得熟练，打结打不好，或者打结打得好，明线缝不好，耽误很多事。如果实行流水作业，工作专业化，缝明线的专缝明线，上兜牙的专上兜牙，一套衣服的全部生产过程，细细地划成许多工序，一条线似地流下去做，每个工人的工作都非常简单，都专业化，生产还怕不能提高？质量还怕没有保证？
    白天我在车间里看，晚上就回家画图，我把一套衣服分成八十多个工序，又按着工程大小难易，把车间里的机器分配到各个工序。安排妥了后，我就找党支部副书记、工长尚万新和另外一个工长范春和商量，又开了党支委会，报告了自己的计划，大家都同意。方法的大问题，一下子全车间都搞起来，怕乱了，就决定从张殿英小组开始试验，由点到面的普遍推广。
    张殿英是个直畅的老工人，我们和他一谈，他说：“不行吧！快的慢的混在一起，没法干，工资又怎么发？”
    工资确实是个问题，工序划细了，没有这么细的工资定额。不过，总不能因为这个把流水作业扔下，我们说服了张殿英，又动员了他们小组的工人。第二天上午做了些准备工作，下午张殿英小组开始试验了。最初的一个多钟头，试验情况不好，八个人里有四个人接不到上手的活，有些人嚷开了：“我说不行嘛！”“几十年干活儿，也没见这样干的。”我心里到不急，我是有底的，就让群众开会找原因，找出两个原因来。一个是劳动力配备不得当，快手分了容易干的活，难活落在慢手里，快慢不匀；一个是工序划分还不妥当，不顺手。第二天重新配备了劳动力，重新划分了工序，产量没高没降，第三天产量提高了百分之十几，第四天产量提高了百分之二十几，流水作业试验成功了，大家都乐开了。
    接着我们开了全车间小组长会议，由张殿英做了实行流水作业的典型报告，开始在全车间推行流水作业。厂长、党总支书记都支撑我们，帮助我们，前后一个半月的时间，全车间都实行了流水作业。到一九五二年一月，三个月的生产任务提前三天完成，而且多做了五千多件。产量降低一半的现象扭转了，生产率还提高了百分之二十六。工作一专业，工人们还提了许多合理化建议，发明了许多专用的工具。
    生产改进了，管理工作就赶不上了。首先是工资问题，没有细的定额，工资算不出来，我们就自己拟了定额草案，让工人讨论通过了。接着是收发赶不上了。原先我也干过收发，那活是累，几百个工人来领活，交活，填卡片，有时面前围了一大堆人，活儿发不出去，工人等在那儿，晚上就只能加班整理料子，准备第二天发。到实行流水作业后，工人固定在自己的工序上，一道一道地流下来谁来填卡片记账啊！我和收发一研究，想出一种作业传票，从第一道工序传下去，工人自己把代号填上，把这问题也给解决了，原先两个收发工作人员减掉一个，工作还不乱。
    这样，七车间缝纫生产的手工业操作方法完全改变了，整个生产过程按照大生产的方法组织起来。后来，这个流水作业法在全厂、全国的许多被服厂，以至皮鞋厂等都推广起来。我被评为武汉市的特等劳动模范，又被提升为厂里的生产科副科长。
    前些日子，缝纫工作的流水作业法又发展了一步，装置了电动传送带，使劳动生产率又提高了一步。
    我在技术革新方面的成就还是很小的，这些成就也是在党和群众的帮助下取得的。这次参观鞍钢技术革新展览会，看到鞍钢工人的许多发明创造，感到在工人阶级的面前是没有克服不了的困难的。潜力是挖不完的，回去后一定要作更多的努力。例如我们厂里的总传送带还没有解决，我想这个问题在现有设备上也是能够解决的，回去后一定要发动大家解决。
