	Zhao Hongzhang and Bima No. 1
	By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao

	I.
	Boarding a train on the western section of the Longhai Railway, traversing the "Eight Hundred Li of Qinchuan," gazing along the way, one sees a magnificent expanse of wheat. Sitting in the carriage, it is as if speeding across a vast green felt. Nearby, the wide leaves, long ears, tall stalks, and thick joints of the wheat shimmer in the sun, dazzling the eyes.

	At this time, one can often hear the exclamations, praises, and brief questions and answers from passengers on the train.
		"Wow! We've never seen such uniformly good wheat along the entire route before."
		"This wheat? It's already reached Xuzhou in the east and Tianshui in the west."
		"What kind of wheat is this?"
		"Bima No. 1."
		"Bima No. 1, hmm, where did this good wheat come from?"
	When it comes to the origin of Bima No. 1, not many people can answer, and even the farmers in Guanzhong can mostly only vaguely say, "The People's Government distributed it." As for its background and details, only farmers in the Wugong area know much about it.

	However, as the influence of Bima No. 1 expands year by year, more and more people are inquiring about its origin. Is this strange? Since it has formed an inextricable bond with the vast number of farmers, who can remain indifferent to its background? Take Guanzhong, for example, a well-known wheat-producing area in the country, with more than 12 million mu of wheat fields. In 1949, only 264 mu were planted with Bima No. 1, all within Wugong County. By 1953, it had expanded to more than 7.5 million mu. In five years, Bima No. 1 had overwhelmed all local varieties, swept across most of Guanzhong, covered more than 40 counties, and occupied 20 percent of the winter wheat area in the Northwest. This grand momentum is unprecedented in the history of wheat in the Northwest. In terms of yield, Bima No. 1 has increased the average yield by 45 jin (catty) per mu since its emergence. In this way, if there are no unexpected disasters this year, it can produce at least 300 million jin more wheat for the farmers in Guanzhong, equivalent to 6 percent of the total winter wheat output in the entire Northwest region. The benefits it will bring to the vast number of farmers in the future are even more significant.

	In the countryside, people who care about the origin of Bima No. 1 are naturally more numerous and eager than passengers on the train.
		"Who exactly did this good deed for us farmers?" "If it were in the old society, we would have built a temple and hung a plaque for him."

	II.
	Speaking of the origin of Bima No. 1, it has had its share of twists and turns.

	It turns out that Bima No. 1 was born in an "experimental farm" in the old society—Northwest Agricultural College. This college, located on Zhangjiagang on the north bank of the Wei River in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, has tall buildings, vast land, beautiful scenery, and a history of more than 20 years. But in the old society, the reactionary ruling class merely regarded it as a "vase" for decoration, not expecting it to really achieve anything. The farmers simply called it "a big building that wastes land."

	However, Northwest Agricultural College did produce an accomplished agronomist named Zhao Hongzhang. It was in his hands that this valuable Bima No. 1 was nurtured.

	Zhao Hongzhang was originally a student at Northwest Agricultural College. After graduating, he stayed there as an assistant teacher. Like other agronomists at the time, he studied nothing more than the bourgeois theories of Morgan, Mendel, and Weismann. According to bourgeois theory, Bima No. 1 would never have been born. Zhao Hongzhang, through his own bold research, broke through bourgeois theories.

	Ten years ago, Zhao Hongzhang was unwilling to continue that college-style life, so he went to a farm in Dali County to conduct wheat experiments in the field. At that time, one thing often stimulated him: he watched year after year as large swaths of wheat developed jaundice and fell over when they grew up. A simple will to resist nature arose.

	Zhao Hongzhang began to study the method of crossbreeding to resist jaundice and lodging.

	He consulted records of experiment results from various farms and discovered that crossbreeding between Mazhamai and Biyu wheat was the most suitable variety for resisting jaundice and lodging. Originally, Mazhamai was not afraid of cold, had abundant tillering, and large ears, which were the shortcomings of Biyu wheat. Biyu wheat, on the other hand, was not afraid of jaundice, black jaundice, culm smut, lodging, or shattering, and had the highest yield and early maturity, which were the shortcomings of Mazhamai. Zhao Hongzhang decided to use Mazhamai as the mother and Biyu wheat as the father, and from 1942, he experimented with crossbreeding to cultivate new varieties, and named it "Bima No. 1," taking the first character from the names of its parents.

	This is the situation before the birth of Bima No. 1.

	But the birth of Bima No. 1 was not smooth sailing!

	When Zhao Hongzhang first acted as a matchmaker for its parents, there were supporters and opponents in the "family." Some encouraged him to try boldly, while others shook their heads and said to him: This violates the theories of the Morgan and Mendel school, this is not the "right path"! This statement also had its basis. According to the genetic theory of the Morgan and Mendel school, hybrid offspring must be separated for five or six years, then single ears or single plants are selected, and yield comparison experiments are conducted for five or six years. In this way, it usually takes ten to twelve years to breed a variety, and it is not necessarily effective, and it wastes manpower and financial resources. But Zhao Hongzhang did not take this "right path." He and several enthusiastic assistants used methods such as systematic separation, single-plant dibbling, fertilized land, continuous recording, early yield comparison, and accelerated propagation to shorten the experimental years. In seven years, he confirmed the variety. Where did Zhao Hongzhang get this courage? For example, other professors used only poor land for variety experiments. Why did he prefer to use fertile land? It turned out that he obtained the practical experience of fertile soil resulting in strong mothers, and strong mothers resulting in strong offspring from the farmers. He believed that varieties cultivated using this experience must also be suitable for the farmers' experience. Some professors blindly worshipped Morgan and Mendel, and of course did not understand or believe this practical experience of the farmers. No wonder they said in a strange and contemptuous tone when they passed through Zhao Hongzhang's experimental field: "Sigh! What kind of tricks are these!"

	In 1948, Bima No. 1 grew to be of outstanding quality. Northwest Agricultural College affirmed Zhao Hongzhang's achievements. Those who originally supported him congratulated him on his success, and those who originally opposed him had nothing to say.

	III.
	Although Bima No. 1 was born, unfortunately, like Zhao Hongzhang's fate, it had no chance to thrive in the era of Kuomintang rule, languishing in this prestigious "family." It was not until the liberation of the Northwest in 1949 that it came to the fore. It met the vast number of farmers and became famous throughout the Northwest in a few years.

	Speaking of coming to the fore and becoming famous, there were still some twists and turns.

	Although Bima No. 1 grew exceptionally well, it had just come out of this prestigious "family." When the farmers first saw it, they praised it in their mouths but doubted it in their hearts, fearing that it was pampered and could not withstand wind and rain, and they did not dare to take it over rashly for the time being. Here, let me mention something from the two years before liberation: Zhao Hongzhang and his companions once tried to introduce Bima No. 1 to the land of a farmer in Zhangjiagang near the college, and planted it in two places with the farmer's beloved Sanling No. 2 wheat to compare the two. The following year, when they threshed and weighed it, Bima No. 1 yielded 50 jin more per mu than Sanling No. 2. Some farmers who visited the threshing floor were surprised and said:
	"The same land, how can Bima No. 1 yield so much more? It's not even sick, its complexion is good, and the grains are big and hard." But afterwards, many farmers became suspicious: "Our ancestors have been planting Sanling No. 2 for many years, and the yield is higher than other varieties. Hmm, the yield of that Bima No. 1 must be a fluke."

	After liberation, farmers could not eliminate their skeptical psychology for a while, and not many people were willing to switch to Bima No. 1.

	However, the world had changed dramatically. The Northwest Agricultural College was no longer a "vase" for the ruling class. It opened its doors, allowing agronomists and students to meet the vast number of farmers with Bima No. 1. The Northwest Department of Agriculture and Forestry (later renamed Bureau), the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Wugong County People's Government also supported them behind the scenes, using various methods to pave the way for Bima No. 1.

	In the first year of liberation—1949, the Northwest Agricultural College first selected 300 mu of whole land nearby and cooperated with farmers to propagate it. In order to dispel the farmers' worries, they first publicized the benefits of Bima No. 1, then guided the farmers in preparing the land and applying fertilizer, mobilized 20 students from the Department of Agronomy to guide sowing, and specially established three demonstration sites in Zhangjiagang, Cuixigou, and Dujiazhai. When the wheat seedlings grew, they mobilized farmers to weed and guided farmers to remove impurities in the field. When the wheat was about to mature, they publicized that good varieties should be pure, threshed and winnowed separately, dried and cleaned. After the wheat was brought to the threshing floor, it was purchased at an additional price (adding 10 percent to the price of high-quality wheat). This year, the average yield per mu of the three demonstration sites was indeed more than 71 jin higher than that of Sanling No. 2. Not only was Bima No. 1's yield high, but the farmers also praised its many benefits: "The bran of this wheat is thin, and it produces more flour. Every dou only has three and a half jin of bran, and it produces 26 jin of flour, which is white and strong." "In recent years, other wheat has been lodging like crazy, and good wheat has turned into bad wheat. With Bima No. 1, we won't be afraid of wheat lodging in the future." "Our livestock love to eat the wheat straw of Bima No. 1!" ... This alarmed the farmers in Wugong County and other counties. The reputation of Bima No. 1 spread further and further. Some farmers from other counties specially ran to the Northwest Agricultural College, willing to exchange two dou of wheat for one dou of Bima No. 1 as seed. Batches of farmers requesting to switch to the variety stepped into the door of this "big building." They not only exchanged for Bima No. 1, but also took away cultivation techniques. From then on, they called Northwest Agricultural College "our school."

	The farmers in Zhangjiagang lived next to the college. After inquiring here and there, they heard that Bima No. 1 came from Zhao Hongzhang's hands, and they regarded him as a benefactor, insisting on putting on a show for him. Of course, the college and Zhao Hongzhang declined this kindness.

	Although the farmers in the distance did not know the details of Bima No. 1, they understood: Without the Communist Party and the People's Government, this Bima No. 1 would not have entered their doors. Therefore, they warmly welcomed the cadres when they saw them. They vacated good houses for the cadres to live in and served the cadres Bima No. 1 noodles. They said repeatedly: "Since the Communist Party came, even the wheat has changed." "We got land during the land reform, and now the government is distributing good wheat seeds, and we are harvesting more grain. We will never forget Chairman Mao."

	From the following material from a high-yielding wheat village, we can further understand this sentiment of the vast number of farmers.

	There is a village called Yuanshu in Wugong County, with a total of 62 peasant households, and the cultivated land is all dry land. In 1949, the whole village planted 601.9 mu of Sanling No. 2 wheat, with a total output of more than 163,000 jin, an average of 271 jin per mu. In 1950, they switched to planting 695.2 mu of Bima No. 1, with a total output of more than 232,000 jin, an average of 334.3 jin per mu, an increase of more than 23 percent compared to the previous year. Among them, the average yield of Li Huaiyu, Li Mingde, and Li Zhenqi for three years was more than 450 jin. Yuanshu Village was originally a backward village, and there were no mutual aid teams before the autumn sowing in 1952. In the past two or three years, the farmers saw the yield of Bima No. 1 increase year by year, and the People's Government and Northwest Agricultural College helped them in many ways, so their enthusiasm for production became higher year by year. By the autumn sowing season in 1952, the whole village had organized 14 mutual aid teams, formulated a patriotic production increase plan for wheat, and strived to make life better and better.

	IV.
	Now, it is the season when wheat is pollinating and filling its grains.

	At this time, Zhao Hongzhang has not stopped his original work. He and his assistants are continuing to experiment with the "rejuvenation" of Bima No. 1 in the wheat fields of the newly built scientific research institute.

	Now, he has abandoned the bourgeois doctrines of Morgan and his ilk. He is trying to use the advanced scientific theory of the great Soviet biologist Michurin—the rejuvenation method—to improve the quality of Bima No. 1 to a higher level, to make it grow stronger and more beautiful.

	This scientist who created Bima No. 1 is now an associate professor at Northwest Agricultural College. His appearance is so simple, wearing a faded blue cloth old uniform, his face tanned brown. At first glance, you would take him for a peasant cadre. In fact, he also has the simple temperament of a farmer. Whether in clothing, speech, or behavior, he does not have the air of the academy. People in the college love to affectionately call him "Labor Model" because when the National Labor Model Conference was held in 1950, Northwest Agricultural College nominated him as a labor model to attend the conference. This year, he was also elected as a representative to the People's Congress of Wugong County.

	Of course, more importantly, Zhao Hongzhang has not become proud and complacent in the face of these honors.

	Many agronomists have studied his experience in creating Bima No. 1, and believe that his views and methods are basically in line with Michurin's theory. He shook his head and said: "This was completely unconsciously stumbled upon. I know very little about even some basic things. I still have to start learning from scratch, especially the advanced science of the Soviet Union." He also said: "I still have to learn from the farmers. In the process of cultivating Bima No. 1, they are actually my teachers."

	Millions of farmers are encouraging and expecting new achievements from this agronomist.

    赵洪璋和碧蚂一号
    本报记者　张潮
    一
    搭上陇海路西段的火车，横贯“八百里秦川”，沿途眺望，真是一片好麦色。坐在车厢里，好似在一幅巨大的绿毡上疾驰而过。近处，那阔叶叶、长穗穗、高秆秆、粗节节的麦子，在太阳下闪闪泛光，耀得人眼花。
    这时节，也就常常可听到列车上旅客们的惊叹、赞美和简短的问答。
      “嗬！往年咱没见过一路上尽是这一色好麦子。”
      “这麦子吗？东边已经到了徐州，西头也到了天水啦。”
      “这是啥麦子？”
      “碧蚂一号。”
      “碧蚂一号，唔，哪来的这好麦子？”
    一问到这碧蚂一号的来路，答得上的人却还不多，就连关中的农民，多半也只能含糊地答上一句
  “咱人民政府发下来的”；至于它的身世底细，除了武功一带的农民外，知道的人就更少了。
    可是，跟着碧蚂一号的势力年年伸展，打听它的来历的人也就越来越多。这有什么奇怪呢？既然它跟广大农民结了不解之缘，谁能对它的身世漠不关心呢？就拿关中来说，这是全国有名的小麦产地之一，共有一千二百多万亩麦地，一九四九年种碧蚂一号的不过二百六十四亩，还不出武功县境，到了一九五三年，就扩大到七百五十多万亩。五年光景，碧蚂一号就压倒当地一切品种，席卷大半个关中，遍布四十几县，占据了西北百分之二十的冬小麦面积。还向陇海路东西两端发展，这股浩大声势，在西北小麦史上是空前的。若拿产量来说，碧蚂一号一出世，每亩平均也增加了四十五斤（市斤）。如此说来，今年要没有意外灾害，少说也能给关中农民增产三亿斤小麦，等于西北全区冬小麦总产量的百分之六。今后它给广大农民带来的好处，就更不用提了。
    在农村里，关心碧蚂一号来历的人，自然要比在火车上的旅客更多更殷切。
      “究竟是谁给咱农民办了这件好事？”“要是在旧社会里，咱非给他修庙挂匾不可。”
    二
    说起碧蚂一号的来历，却也有它一段曲折哩。
    原来碧蚂一号出生在旧社会里一个“实验农家”——西北农学院。这所学院，坐落在陕西武功县境渭河北岸的张家岗上，楼高地广，风景秀丽，已有二十多年历史。但在旧社会里，反动统治阶级无非把它当做“花瓶”，点缀点缀罢了，并不指望它真正有所作为；农民就干脆管它叫“大楼家，糟蹋地”。
    不过西北农学院毕竟也出了一位有作为的农学家，此人名叫赵洪璋，就在他的手里，养育出了这名贵的碧蚂一号。
    赵洪璋原是西北农学院的学生，毕了业，便留在那儿当助教。他跟当时别的农学家一样，学的不外是摩尔根、孟德尔、魏司曼之流的资产阶级学说。照资产阶级的理论，就不会有碧蚂一号的出世。赵洪璋经过自己大胆的钻研，突破了资产阶级的理论。
    在十年以前，赵洪璋不愿继续度那学院式的生活，便到大荔的一个农场里去，实地试验小麦。那时候，有一件事常常刺激着他，他年年眼看着大片大片的麦子发生黄疸病，长大了又要倒伏。一种朴素的反抗自然的意志便抬起头来了。
    赵洪璋开始研究用杂交育种的方法来抵抗黄疸和倒伏的侵袭。
    他到处翻阅各农场试验结果的纪录，发现蚂蚱麦和碧玉麦杂交是抵抗黄疸和倒伏的最适宜的品种。原来蚂蚱麦不怕冷、分蘖多、穗子大，这些正是碧玉麦的缺点，而碧玉麦不怕黄疸、黑疸、秆黑粉、倒伏、落粒，产量最高，成熟又早，这些正是蚂蚱麦的缺点，赵洪璋便决定拿蚂蚱麦作母亲，碧玉麦作父亲，从一九四二年起，试行杂交，培育新品种，并且取它父母名字的第一个字，给它起名为
  “碧蚂一号”。
    这就是碧蚂一号出世前的情形。
    可是碧蚂一号出世并不是一帆风顺呵！
    赵洪璋给它父母作媒之初，“家”里的人有赞成的，也有反对的。有的鼓励他大胆试一试，有的却对他摇摇头说：这是违反摩尔根、孟德尔派学说的，这不是“正道”！这话原也有它的根据。按照摩尔根、孟德尔派的遗传理论，要把杂交的后代分离五、六年，再选单穗或者单株，作五、六年的产量比较试验。这样，育成一个品种通常要花十年到十二年的时间，还不见得有效，而且浪费人力和财力。可是赵洪璋没走这条“正道”，他和几位热心的助手，试用系统分离、单株点播、加肥土地、随时记载、提早比产、加速繁殖等办法，缩短了试验年限，用七年时间就肯定了品种。赵洪璋哪来的这胆量呢？比方说，别的教授试验品种，只用薄地，他为啥偏用肥地呢？原来他从农民中得到了地肥母壮、母肥子壮的实际经验，他相信用这条经验培育出来的品种，一定也适合农民的经验。有些教授一味崇拜摩尔根、孟德尔，当然不懂得也不相信农民的这条实际经验，无怪他们走过赵洪璋的试验地里时，用又奇怪又轻蔑的口气说：“咳！这是搞啥名堂！”
    一九四八年，碧蚂一号果然长得品质出众，西北农学院肯定了赵洪璋的成绩，原先赞成的人庆贺他成功，原先反对的人也无话可说了。
    三
    碧蚂一号虽然出了世，可惜的是跟赵洪璋命运一样，在国民党统治的时代里，出头无日，在这个名门“家庭”里消磨着光阴。直守到一九四九年西北解放，它才出了头。和广大农民见面了，几年功夫，就名扬西北。
    说到出头扬名，少不得还有一点儿波折。
    碧蚂一号固然长得非凡出众，只是刚从这个名门“家庭”出来，农民们初见它，口里称赞，心里怀疑，怕它娇生惯养，经不起风吹雨打，一时不敢贸然接手。这儿顺便提一提解放前两年的事情：赵洪璋和他的几位同伴，曾经试着将碧蚂一号引到学院附近张家岗上一家农民的地里，跟农民最心爱的三零二号小麦分成两处种在一起，比一比高低。第二年打到场上一称，碧蚂一号果然比三零二号每亩多打了五十斤。到场上参观的一些农民吃惊地说：
  “一样的地，这碧蚂一号怎么能多打这许多？还没病，气色好，颗颗又大又硬。”可是过后又有许多农民怀疑起来：“咱祖辈多年种的都是三零二号，产量也比别的品种高，唔，那碧蚂一号的产量，怕是碰上的。”
    解放后，农民一时消除不了半信半疑的心理，愿意改种碧蚂一号的人还不多。
    不过世事大变样了，那西北农学院不再是统治阶级的“花瓶”了，它打开大门，让农学家们和学员们跟碧蚂一号一道，去和广大农民见面。西北农林部（后改局）、陕西省农林厅和武功县人民政府也在背后给他们撑腰，用种种办法，给碧蚂一号开道引路。
    解放头一年——一九四九年，西北农学院第一步就在附近选择整块的土地三百亩，和农民合作繁殖。为了打消农民的顾虑，他们先宣传了碧蚂一号的好处，跟着就指导农民整地施肥，发动农艺系二十位学员指导播种，还特别在张家岗、崔西沟、杜家寨搞起三处示范地。麦苗长起来了，又发动农民锄草，指导农民田间去杂，麦子快熟了，又宣传良种要纯，单打单碾，晒干扬净。麦子上场后，加成收购（按上等麦价加一成）。这一年，三处示范地的每亩平均产量果然又比三零二号超过七十一斤多。碧蚂一号不光产量高，农民们还满口夸奖它的许多好处：“这麦麸皮薄，出面多，每斗只有三斤半麸皮，出的面有二十六斤，又白又有劲气。”“这几年别的麦子一股劲倒伏，好麦变成了坏麦，有了碧蚂一号，以后就不怕麦倒了。”“碧蚂一号的麦草，咱牲口都爱吃得很哩！”……这一来，就惊动了武功县和外县的农民，碧蚂一号的名气越传越远，外县的农民有些特地跑到西北农学院来，愿意用二斗小麦换一斗碧蚂一号做种子，请求换种的农民一批又一批地踏进了这个“大楼家”的门，他们不光换走了碧蚂一号，同时带走了务育技术。从此，他们把西北农学院叫作“咱的学校”了。
    张家岗的农民就住在学院旁边，东探西问，听说碧蚂一号是从赵洪璋手里出来的，简直把他当恩人看待，硬要给他唱一台戏，当然，学院和赵洪璋谢绝了这番好意。
    远处的农民虽然不知道碧蚂一号的底细，可是他们懂得：没有共产党和人民政府，这碧蚂一号也进不了自己的门。因此，他们一见干部，便亲热地欢迎他们。腾出好房子给干部住，捍碧蚂一号面条给干部吃。一叠连声地说：“共产党来了，连麦子也变了样。”“土地改革当中分得了地，如今政府又发好麦种，多打了粮食，我们永远忘不了毛主席。”
    从下面一个小麦丰产村的材料中，可以进一步理解广大农民的这种心情。
    武功县内有一个元树村，共有六十二户农民，耕地都是旱园平地。一九四九年，全村种了六百零一点九亩三零二号小麦，总产量十六万三千多斤，每亩平均二百七十一斤；一九五零年改种了六百九十五点二亩碧蚂一号，总产量达到二十三万二千多斤，每亩平均三百三十四点三斤，比前一年增产百分之二十三强，其中李怀玉、李明德、李振岐三户，三年的平均产量都在四百五十斤以上。元树村原是落后村，一九五二年秋播前还没有互助组。这两三年中，农民眼看着碧蚂一号的产量年年增加，人民政府和西北农学院又多方面帮助他们，生产劲头也就一年比一年高，到一九五二年秋播时节，全村组织起了十四个互助组，订出了小麦爱国丰产计划，争取日子越过越美。
    四
    现在，正是小麦受粉灌浆的时节。
    这时节，赵洪璋并没有停止他原来的工作，他和他的助手们，正在新建的科学研究所的麦地里，继续试验着碧蚂一号的“复壮”工作。
    现在，他已经抛弃了摩尔根之流的资产阶级学说，他试用着苏联伟大的生物学家米丘林的先进科学理论——复壮法，要把碧蚂一号的品质提高一步，使它长得更强壮，美上加美。
    这位创造碧蚂一号的科学家，现在已是西北农学院的副教授，他的外表却是那样朴实，穿着一套褪色的蓝布旧制服，面孔晒得褐酱色，乍一见他，你会把他当作一个农民干部。事实上，他也有着农民的朴实的气质。无论是服饰、言谈、举止，没有沾染一点学院的气味。学院里的人都爱亲切地叫他“劳模”，这是因为一九五零年全国劳动模范大会开会的时候，西北农学院推选他为劳动模范出席大会。今年，他又被选为武功县人民代表大会的代表。
    当然，更重要的是赵洪璋没有在这些荣誉面前骄傲自满起来。
    许多农学家研究了他创造碧蚂一号的经验，认为他的观点和方法基本上是符合米丘林的学说的。他摇摇头说：“这完全是不自觉地胡乱碰上的，我连一些基本的东西都知道得很少，我还得从头学起，特别是苏联的先进科学。”他又说：“还得向农民学习，在培育碧蚂一号的过程中，他们实际上也是我的老师。”
    千百万农民正在鼓舞着、期待着这位农学家的新的成就哩。
