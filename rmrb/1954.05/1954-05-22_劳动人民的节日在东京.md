    Labor Day in Tokyo
    Lan Hai

    On the morning of May 1st, the night rain suddenly stopped, the sky was clear, and the soft sunlight shone all over the earth. In Tokyo, with its particularly beautiful scenery, people poured into the verdant Meiji Jingu Gaien Square from all directions. Six hundred thousand Japanese laborers, holding high red flags and banners, formed a sea of people and flags; songs and slogans echoed in the clear May sky. Today is a great festival for the Japanese laboring people to review their strength.

    In front of the rostrum of the celebration meeting, a huge image of a peace dove was hung high. Above and to the left and right of the image, large red banners with the central slogans of the 25th Japanese "May Day" International Labor Day celebration were horizontally arranged: "Oppose the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement and rearmament, defend the peaceful constitution," "Down with fascist forces, defend freedom and democracy," "Increase wages, oppose heavy taxes, and strive to establish a minimum wage system." Nine large red flags surrounded these slogans, fluttering in the early summer breeze.

    Before the meeting began, the Central Choir and many union singing teams successively sang majestic songs on the rostrum. The Korean Artists Troupe in Japan and the Chinese Music Research Association also successively performed Korean song and dance and Chinese Yangko dance and waist drum dance on the rostrum. The venue was filled with a solemn and festive atmosphere.

    The characteristics of this year's Tokyo "May Day" International Labor Day celebration are its large scale and unified action. This signifies that the struggle of the Japanese laboring people has greatly advanced.

    At exactly ten o'clock, the meeting opened with the whole audience singing "The Song of May Day." Six union leaders, including Fujita Totaro (Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) and Yoshida Sukesada (Chairman of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations), were elected to form the presidium. Fujita delivered a speech on behalf of the presidium, pointing out that the reactionary Yoshida government is now plotting to drive the Japanese people into a war of aggression. It has approved the "U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," which is destroying the lives of the Japanese people, trampling on freedom and human rights, forcibly enacting two educational bills that undermine education, forcibly stopping wage payments, and dismissing workers on a large scale under the pretext of implementing "enterprise rationalization." There is no other way for the Japanese laboring people but to fight against it. Laboring people only have strength when they unite. We must strengthen our unity and move forward courageously!

    Next, representatives of various political parties spoke. Kasuga Shoichi, the representative of the Japanese Communist Party, said: For bread, freedom, and peace, the working classes of Japan and all countries in the world have never struggled so strongly as they do today. This is a huge force in preventing war provocations by U.S. imperialism and easing international tensions. We, the Japanese working class, must shatter the persecution of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and oppose the revival of Japanese militarism. The great unified action power of the Japanese working class displayed here on International Labor Day today has taken the struggle against the "U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," against the revival of militarism, and against the Yoshida government a step forward. Let us work harder to complete the glorious historical mission of our Japanese nation! Kuroda Hisao, the representative of the Labor-Farmer Party, pointed out: The Yoshida government has manipulated the Diet to approve the "U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," which comes into effect today. We must always keep this in mind today. The difference between the Yoshida fascist government and the Tojo fascist government is that it has the atomic imperialism of the United States behind it. The only way to fight the Yoshida government and make it collapse is the kind of huge unified action that everyone is showing today. In order to oppose war, defend peace, and drive the American soldiers back, we must achieve a larger-scale unified action.

    Amid cheers and applause, the meeting read out congratulatory messages from trade union organizations around the world, including the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, the Central Council of the Bulgarian Trade Unions, the Central Council of the Romanian General Trade Union, the Hungarian Trade Union Council, the French General Confederation of Labor, and the Italian General Confederation of Labor. The meeting then passed seven resolutions, including opposing war and striving for peace, immediately banning atomic weapons, overthrowing the Yoshida corrupt cabinet, and ensuring the right to life. The resolution opposing war and striving for peace pointed out that the Japanese working class opposes the San Francisco unilateral "peace treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," and the "U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," opposes rearmament, demands the withdrawal of foreign troops, the removal of military bases, the overthrow of fascist forces, and the defense of the peaceful constitution.

    At this time, the red flags held high in the venue were waved to the fullest extent. In the enthusiastic atmosphere, the declaration of the 25th Japanese "May Day" International Labor Day celebration was adopted. The declaration first solemnly stated the confidence and determination of the Japanese laboring people to strive for peace, national independence, and democratic freedom. It then pointed out that with the signing of the "U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," Japan's rearmament has become an obvious and public fact. The Japanese ruling clique is plotting to revise the constitution and open the road to war. This policy is reviving the dark politics of the past, plunging the Japanese economy into an abyss of bankruptcy, and destroying the lives of the people. The declaration finally stated that the Japanese laboring people will take the victory of unified action gained in this year's "May Day" International Labor Day as a new starting point and continue to move forward more bravely!

    The meeting closed with the entire audience singing "The Internationale."

    At exactly twelve o'clock, the torrent of people began to move. Six hundred thousand laboring people were divided into five magnificent teams, led by bands, and set off for demonstrations in five routes: east, south, west, north, and center.

    The demonstrators held high portraits of leaders of communist and workers' parties from various countries, such as Lenin, Stalin, Malenkov, Mao Zedong, and Tokuda Kyuichi, as well as red flags and banners, singing songs and shouting slogans, and marching in an orderly and majestic manner on the streets of Tokyo. Every banner reflected the voice of the Japanese laboring people: "Oppose the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," "Oppose rearmament," "Strive for the success of the Geneva Conference," "Ban atomic weapons," "Yankees go home," "Overthrow the Yoshida corrupt cabinet," "Promote Japan-China trade"…. The demonstration was welcomed with cheers and applause from the citizens along the way, and the mood was more enthusiastic than in previous years.

    Today, the Japanese people have seen the hideous faces of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries more clearly. Due to the righteous anger aroused by the fascist tyranny of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, due to the opposition to the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," opposition to rearmament, opposition to U.S. hydrogen bomb tests, and demands to overthrow the Yoshida corrupt government, the hearts of the broad masses of the Japanese people have been linked together.

    On "May Day" International Labor Day, the U.S.-Japanese reactionary authorities in Tokyo mobilized more than 20,000 armed police to maintain strict vigilance. Many places, such as the Liberal Party headquarters and the Diet, were equipped with barbed wire, defending as if facing a formidable enemy. The U.S. military authorities had to issue an order in advance prohibiting American soldiers from going out that day. Therefore, contrary to the arrogant scene of American soldiers in Tokyo in the past, not a single American soldier could be seen on the streets of Tokyo on "May Day" International Labor Day.

    When the demonstration reached the front of the Liberal Party headquarters, the demonstrators shouted "Down with the Yoshida corrupt cabinet" and twisted the procession into a snake-shaped queue to express their demonstration and protest. More than a dozen police cars and hundreds of armed police officers who were on guard there used loudspeakers to prevent the procession from forming a snake-shaped queue. However, the demonstrators marched even more bravely, and like an electric wave, it immediately spread to the five routes of the team, and the five magnificent teams all formed snake-shaped queues and marched mightily.

    When the demonstration passed the financial building where the U.S. military barracks were located, the masses found American soldiers sticking their heads out of the windows, and they unanimously shouted angrily: "Yankees, go home!" Many American soldiers were so frightened that they shrank back, and the citizens on the roadside excitedly applauded warmly.

    At 4:30 p.m., the five magnificent teams reached their destinations according to plan. For a full four and a half hours, the sky over Tokyo vibrated with the songs and slogans of the Japanese laboring people opposing war and demanding peace and independence; the momentum of the Japanese laboring people overawed the Japanese capital.

    On the same day, the laboring people in many large and small cities throughout Japan also warmly held "May Day" International Labor Day celebration rallies and demonstrations, which were unprecedentedly large and unified in action. The broad masses of the Japanese laboring people deeply understand the truth that "unity is strength." (Attached picture)

    劳动人民的节日在东京
    蓝海
    五月一日的清晨，夜雨骤止，天朗气清，柔和的阳光普照着大地，景色显得分外秀丽的东京市内，人流从四面八方涌进了绿树葱葱的明治神宫外苑广场。六十万日本劳动人民高举着红旗、标语牌，汇成一片人和旗帜的海洋；歌声、口号声响彻了五月的晴空。今天——日本劳动人民检阅自己力量的伟大节日。
    庆祝大会的主席台前，高悬着巨大的和平鸽画像。画像的上面和左右，横列着日本第二十五届庆祝“五一”国际劳动节中心口号的红字大幅标语：“反对美日共同防御援助协定和重整军备、保卫和平宪法”，“打倒法西斯势力保卫自由与民主”，“提高工资、反对重税、争取建立最低工资制度”。九面大红旗围绕着这些标语，在初夏的和风中飘扬。
    大会开会前，中央合唱团和许多工会的歌咏队，陆续在主席台上演唱雄壮的歌曲，旅日朝鲜侨民文工团、中国音乐研究会，也相继在主席台上表演朝鲜歌舞和中国的秧歌舞、腰鼓舞。会场充满了严肃而欢庆的气氛。
    今年东京庆祝“五一”国际劳动节大会的特点是：规模巨大和行动统一。这标志着日本劳动人民的斗争已大大向前推进了。
    十时正，大会在全场合唱“‘五一’节之歌”的歌声中开幕。选出藤田藤太郎（日本工会总评议会主席）、吉田资治（全日本产业别工会会议主席）等六个工会领导人组成了主席团。藤田代表主席团致词，他指出：现在，反动的吉田政府正在阴谋驱使日本人民卷入侵略战争，它批准了“美日共同防御援助协定”，破坏日本人民生活，蹂躏自由和人权，强迫制订摧残教育的两项教育法案，强行停付工资、借口实施“企业合理化”大批解雇工人，日本劳动人民除了与之进行斗争之外再没有其他生路。劳动人民只有团结起来才有力量，我们要加强团结，奋勇前进！
    接着，各党派代表讲话。日本共产党代表春日正一说：为了面包、自由与和平，日本和世界各国工人阶级，从没有像今天这样强烈地进行斗争，这就是制止美帝国主义的战争挑衅、缓和国际紧张局势的巨大力量。我们日本工人阶级必须粉碎美日反动派的迫害，反对日本军国主义复活。今天国际劳动节在这里表现出来的日本工人阶级巨大的统一行动的力量，已把反对“美日共同防御援助协定”、反对复活军国主义、反对吉田政府的斗争向前推进了一步。让我们更加努力，以完成我日本民族的光荣历史任务吧！劳农党代表黑田寿男指出：吉田政府已经操纵国会批准了“美日共同防御援助协定”并且从今天起生效，今天我们在这里必须把这事永远牢记在心中。吉田法西斯政府和东条法西斯政府不同的，就是因为它的背后有原子帝国主义的美国。怎样和吉田政府进行斗争以及怎样使它垮台，大家今天显示出来的这样巨大的统一行动，就是唯一的办法。我们为了反对战争、保卫和平，为了把美国兵赶回去，就要实现更大规模的统一行动。
    大会在欢呼与掌声中，宣读了世界工会联合会、世界工联亚澳联络局、中华全国总工会、越南总工会、保加利亚总工会中央理事会、罗马尼亚总工会中央理事会、匈牙利工会理事会、法国总工会、意大利总工会等发自世界各国工会组织的贺电。大会接着并通过了反对战争争取和平，立即禁止原子武器，打倒吉田贪污内阁、确保生活权利等七项决议。反对战争争取和平的决议中指出，日本工人阶级反对旧金山片面“和约”，“美日安全保障条约”和“美日共同防御援助协定”，反对重新武装、要求撤退外国军队，撤除军事基地，打倒法西斯势力、保卫和平宪法。
    这时，会场中高举着的红旗都被尽情地挥舞起来，在热烈的情绪中通过了日本第二十五届庆祝“五一”国际劳动节大会宣言。宣言首先庄严地表明了日本劳动人民为争取和平、民族独立与民主自由的信心和决心。接着指出，随着“美日共同防御援助协定”的签订，日本的重整军备已经成了有目共睹的公开事实。日本统治集团正阴谋修改宪法，打开走向战争的道路。这种政策正使昔日的黑暗政治复活，使日本经济陷于破产的深渊，破坏人民的生活。宣言最后表示，日本劳动人民将以今年“五一”国际劳动节获得的行动统一的胜利作为新的出发点，更英勇地不断向前迈进！
    大会在全体合唱“国际歌”声中闭幕。
    十二时正，群众的洪流开始移动了。六十万劳动人民分成五支雄壮的队伍，在乐队的前导下分为东、南、西、北、中五路出发示威游行。
    示威群众高举着列宁、斯大林、马林科夫、毛泽东、德田球一等各国共产党和工人党的领袖像和红旗、标语牌，唱着歌喊着口号，在东京市街上整齐雄壮地行进。每一个标语牌上，都反映出日本劳动人民的心声：“反对美日共同防御援助协定”、“反对重整军备”、“争取日内瓦会议成功”、“禁止原子武器”、“美国佬滚回去”、“打倒吉田贪污内阁”、“促进日中贸易”……。示威队伍得到沿途市民欢呼和鼓掌欢迎，情绪比往年更加热烈。
    今天，日本人民已经更加看清楚了美日反动派的狰狞面目。由于美日反动派法西斯暴政激起的正义愤怒，由于反对美日“共同防御援助协定”、反对重整军备、反对美国试验氢弹和要求打倒吉田贪污政府，日本广大人民的心已经连成一片了。
    东京市的美日反动派当局，在“五一”国际劳动节出动了两万多名武装警察严加戒备。自由党本部、国会等许多场所都布置了铁丝网，如临大敌地防守着。美军当局不得不事先下令禁止美国兵当天出门。因而，和往日美国兵在东京市飞扬跋扈的景象相反，“五一”国际劳动节这一天，东京街头看不到一个美国兵。
    示威队伍到达自由党本部前，示威者一面高呼：“打倒吉田贪污内阁”，一面把队伍曲折成为表示示威和抗议的蛇形队列前进。在那里戒备的十几辆警备车和数百名武装警察，通过扩音机制止队伍弯成蛇形队列。但是示威者反而更加英勇地行进，而且像电波一样，立即传遍了五条路线的队伍，五支雄壮的队伍都形成蛇形队列浩荡前进。
    示威队伍经过美国驻军宿舍金融大厦时，群众发现美国兵在从楼窗中伸出头来，就一致高声怒斥：“美国佬，滚回去！”许多美国兵吓得缩回头去，路旁的市民兴奋得热烈鼓掌。
    下午四时三十分，五支雄壮的队伍按着预定计划到达了目的地。整整四个半小时，东京市上空震动着日本劳动人民反对战争，要求和平与独立的歌声和口号声；日本劳动人民的声势，威压着日本首都。
    同一天，日本全国各地许多大大小小城市的劳动人民，也热烈地举行了“五一”国际劳动节的庆祝集会和示威游行，规模空前巨大而且行动统一。日本的广大劳动人民，深深理解“团结就是力量”这一条真理。（附图片）
