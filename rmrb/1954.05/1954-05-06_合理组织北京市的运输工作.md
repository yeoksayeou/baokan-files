    Rationally Organize Beijing's Transportation Work
    A letter from Chen Yongzhong of the Beijing Transportation Company Trade Union: According to our company's preliminary investigation, Beijing's total construction area for capital construction in 1954 is very large, and the transportation task for building materials is very heavy. However, the existing transportation capacity of public and private transportation tools in Beijing is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of various construction units. Therefore, rationally organizing and using the city's transportation resources has become a very important issue.
    Although the material preparation situation of various units this year is better than last year (last year, material transportation only started after April 15th, while this year, 130 to 140 million bricks were transported by the end of the first quarter), most capital construction units have not yet completed their construction preparation work, especially key projects that have not yet started material preparation. This is bound to create a situation where transportation capacity is idle at present, while transportation capacity will be insufficient in the future. The Beijing Transportation Company's business was very slow in the first quarter, and by the end of March, 50% of its cars and 40% of its horse carts were idle. The transportation work in April is still in a relaxed state, and the waste of transportation capacity is very large. It is estimated that most of the cargo transportation will be concentrated in May and June, and may even be delayed to the third quarter, which has the most rainfall and is the busiest time for agricultural work. Therefore, in the second and third quarters, it is possible that the excessive transportation tasks and insufficient transportation capacity will cause construction units to stop work waiting for materials, start work waiting for materials, and create chaotic phenomena such as scattered vehicles running around and price gouging.
    The time is now very pressing. In order to make the transportation work adapt to the needs of capital construction, it is suggested that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government conduct in-depth inspections of the material preparation work of capital construction engineering units, and urge all units to put the rational use of transportation resources on the agenda. It is recommended that the Beijing Municipal Finance Committee, when reviewing construction designs and allocating building materials, must make appropriate arrangements based on the existing transportation capacity and the urgency of the tasks. In addition, in order to ensure the supply of daily necessities for the people of the city, the relevant departments should also formulate a plan and submit it to the transportation company so that transportation can be carried out in an organized and orderly manner under a unified plan.

### 合理组织北京市的运输工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    合理组织北京市的运输工作
    北京市运输公司工会陈用中来信：根据我公司的初步调查，北京市一九五四年全年基本建设施工面积很大，建筑材料的运输任务很重。但北京市现有公私营运输工具的运送能力，显然不足应付各建筑单位的需要。因此，合理组织和使用市内的运输力量便成为一个很重要的问题。
    今年各单位的备料情况虽比去年较好，去年在四月十五日后才开始运料，今年第一季度末即已运砖一亿三、四千万块；但大部分基本建设单位至今还没有作好施工准备工作，特别是重点工程还没有开始备料工作。这就势必造成目前运输力量空闲，而今后运输力量不足的现象。北京市运输公司第一季度的业务很清淡，至三月末尚有百分之五十的汽车和百分之四十的马车被闲置着；四月份运输工作仍处于松弛状态，运输力的浪费很大。估计大部分货运将集中到五、六月份，甚至拖到全年雨量最多又值农事最忙的第三季度。因此，第二、三季度可能由于运输任务过重，运输力量不足，而造成建筑单位停工待料、待料开工和散车流窜、哄抬运价等混乱现象。
    目前时间已很紧迫。为了使运输工作能适应基本建设的需要，建议中共北京市委和北京市人民政府对基本建设工程单位备料工作进行深入的检查，并督促各单位把合理使用运输力量问题提到议事日程上来。建议北京市财委在审核施工设计和调拨建筑材料时，必须根据现有运输力量和任务的轻重缓急，进行妥善的安排。此外，为保证全市人民生活资料的供应，亦应由有关部门作出计划提交运输公司，以便在统一计划下有组织、有秩序地进行运输。
