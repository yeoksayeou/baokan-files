    Sichuan, Guizhou, Xikang and other provinces have begun intensive rice transplanting work.
    Rice transplanting has begun in various parts of Sichuan, Chishui and Xishui in Guizhou, and Hanyuan and Xichang in Xikang. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region and Zhaotong and Qujing prefectures in Yunnan, rice transplanting is nearing completion. Before transplanting, Luzhou, Yibin, Jiangjin, Neijiang and other prefectures in Sichuan held technical seminars and rice transplanters' meetings to exchange and promote the experience of sparse seedling and dense planting. All 158 state-owned farms in the province also held technical demonstrations for visiting farmers. Twelve agricultural cooperatives in Neijiang County adopted the method of division of labor, "contracted harvesting, contracted transplanting, and contracted planting," rationally organized the labor force, and completed transplanting and harvesting of minor spring crops ahead of schedule. In order to save water for rice transplanting, Yuanmou County in Yunnan Province established the Longchuan River Water Conservancy Management Committee to uniformly manage water use and check and plug loopholes, so that the daily irrigation area of the river increased from 30 mu to 80 mu. For farmers in Wusheng County, Sichuan, who lacked seedlings, Wan'shan Township mobilized mutual adjustments to ensure full planting.

    四川贵州西康等省开始插秧
    四川各地、贵州赤水、鳛水及西康汉源、西昌等地均开始了紧张的栽秧工作。云南西双版纳傣族自治区和昭通、曲靖等专区栽秧将近结束。栽秧前四川泸州、宜宾、江津、内江等专区召开技术座谈会、秧师会，交流推广少秧密植经验，全省一百五十八个国营农场并向各地参观农民举行了技术示范。内江县十二个农业社采取分工分业、“包收包插包种”的办法，合理组织劳动力，提前完成栽秧和小春收割。为节约插秧用水，云南元谋县成立了龙川河水利管理委员会，统一管理用水，检查堵塞漏洞，使该河每天灌田由三十亩增至八十亩；四川武胜县万善乡对于短缺秧苗的农民，发动相互调剂，保证了满栽满插。
