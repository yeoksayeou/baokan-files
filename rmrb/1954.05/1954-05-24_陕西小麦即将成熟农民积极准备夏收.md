Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 23rd: Winter wheat in Shaanxi Province is about to ripen, and farmers in wheat-producing areas are actively preparing for the summer harvest. The three newly established machine tractor stations and eight horse-drawn machine stations in the province have formulated summer harvest operation plans, and have signed contracts for substitute harvesting, substitute plowing, and substitute planting with key local agricultural producers' cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams. The majority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the province have formulated summer harvest and summer selection plans to ensure early harvesting, early threshing, early payment of agricultural taxes, and early sale of surplus grain to the state. The Ma Tinghai Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Dali County has divided all the male and female labor force of the cooperative into harvesting teams, transportation teams, and threshing teams. It is planned that the cooperative's 487 mu of wheat and peas will be cleared within seventeen days. Female members of the seven mutual aid teams in Niejiacun, Hua County, plan to select 4,500 jin of the "Bima No. 1" fine seed variety in the fields, and will also take 1,000 jin of it to exchange with farmers in other villages. The ten agricultural producers' cooperatives, more than 1,000 year-round mutual aid teams, and farmers in 31 key villages in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area, in order to avoid delaying cotton field management during the wheat harvest, have specially stipulated in the summer harvest plan that cotton seedlings will be thinned, fixed, and cultivated and weeded once before the wheat harvest; and that special personnel will be assigned to prevent and control pests to ensure all-round increase in wheat and cotton production. Many mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Baoji, Chenggu, and Nanzheng counties in the south have also proposed in the summer harvest plan that "wheat harvesting and rice transplanting should not be delayed." Now, a large amount of manure fertilizer for paddy fields has been transported to the field ridges, waiting for the wheat to be harvested, so that fertilizer can be applied, water can be released, and the land can be plowed in time for timely rice transplanting.

In order to help farmers with the summer harvest, the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union has supplied farmers with more than 220,000 sickles alone, and wheat rakes, wire mesh sieves, etc. are being shipped to the countryside.

    陕西小麦即将成熟农民积极准备夏收
   【新华社西安二十三日电】陕西省冬小麦即将成熟，产麦区的农民们正积极准备夏收。全省新建立的三个机器拖拉机站和八个马拉机站已订出夏收作业计划，分别和当地重点农业生产合作社和常年互助组签订了代收、代耕、代种合同。全省大部分农业生产合作社和互助组都制订了夏收夏选计划，保证早收、早打、早缴农业税，早把余粮卖给国家。大荔县马廷海农业生产合作社，已把全社男女劳动力分组成收割队、搬运队、碾打队。全社四百八十七亩小麦、豌豆，计划在十七天内做到场光地净。华县聂家村七个互助组联组的女组员，准备在田间穗选“碧蚂一号”良种四千五百斤，还拿出其中的一千斤换给外村农民。泾惠渠灌溉区的十个农业生产合作社、一千多个常年互助组和三十一个重点村的农民，为了在收割小麦期间不致耽误棉田管理，特别在夏收计划中规定了麦收前实行棉花间苗、定苗和中耕除草各一次；抽出专人防治虫害，以保证麦、棉的全面增产。南部褒城、城固、南郑等县的许多互助合作组织，也在夏收计划中提出
  “割麦插秧（水稻）两不耽误”，现在已把稻田用的大量粪肥运送到地畔，只等小麦割完，立即施肥和放水耕地，及时插秧。
    为了帮助农民进行夏收，陕西省供销合作社联合社仅镰刀一项就给农民供应了二十二万多把，麦耙、铁丝筛等正源源运往农村。
