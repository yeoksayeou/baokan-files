    Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions
    Holds Mobilization Meeting for Technological Innovation Movement
    The Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions held a city-wide mobilization meeting on the 17th and 18th of this month for factories and mines to launch a technological innovation movement. Wang Guixin, Vice Chairman of the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions, conveyed the situation and experiences of visiting the Anshan Iron and Steel technological innovation exhibition. The knitting department of the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory introduced the innovation initiative proposed by Wang Dawu, an advanced producer in the department, to increase the number of revolutions and lines. Other work sections organized corresponding innovation measures, thus changing the historically backward situation and increasing the department's production capacity this year to the equivalent of two knitting departments last year. At the meeting, the steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also introduced the experience of mechanizing manual loading and transporting of materials. The Second Power Plant of the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau introduced the experience of carrying out inter-factory competitions. The meeting decided that each factory and mine will start from the following three aspects to further carry out the technological innovation movement: (1) Check the weak links in the factory's production and propose a technological innovation plan aimed at the main problems of the factory; (2) Check the heavy manual labor situation in the factory and gradually study improvements; (3) Check the handling of rationalization proposals and earnestly rectify the organization of rationalization proposals. The meeting also decided to hold a city-wide technological innovation exhibition in mid-July.
    At this mobilization meeting, 185 units and individuals who made significant contributions to technological innovation last year were rewarded. Among the model units awarded were the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, which created a rapid forging and riveting method to complete the annual task three months ahead of schedule and increase production and save 12 billion yuan, and eleven other units; among the model groups awarded at the meeting were the Liang Ming group of the Dongshan Coal Mine, which created a manual tunneling large-cycle operation method to complete the annual task three months ahead of schedule and complete the production plan for 43 consecutive months, and 83 other groups; among the individuals awarded at the meeting were Huang Qingtai, a worker at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, who extended the life of the steel furnace wall by more than seven times, and Zhao Fuzeng, an engineer at the Municipal Engineering Company, who saved 3.8 billion yuan in the design of the Fenhe River Bridge, and 91 other people. The above-mentioned awarded units and individuals have been approved by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government as provincial-level models.
