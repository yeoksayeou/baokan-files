    Shandong Provincial Cooperatives Actively Supply Farmers with "666" Pesticide
    The Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Office is actively supplying farmers with large quantities of "666" pesticide. The amount of "666" pesticide that has been allocated to grassroots cooperatives in various regions has reached more than 840,000 jin, an increase of more than four times compared to the same period last year. Due to improvements in production by industrial departments and improved management by the cooperative system, reducing circulation costs, the price of "666" pesticide supplied to farmers this year has been greatly reduced. For example, 6% wettable "666" pesticide cost 15,000 yuan per jin last year, but this year it costs 9,000 yuan per jin, a reduction of 6,000 yuan.
    In order to fully supply farmers with "666" pesticide, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Office has revised its original purchase plan based on the needs of farmers, adding another 800,000 jin, and has allocated the existing "666" pesticide to seven means of production storage and transportation stations for separate supply.

    山东省合作社总社
    积极供应农民“六六六”农药
    山东省合作总社积极供应农民大批“六六六”农药。现已调拨到各地基层社的“六六六”农药，已达八十四万余斤，比去年同期增加了四倍多。由于工业部门改进了生产，合作社系统改善经营管理，降低了流转费用，因此，今年供给农民的“六六六”农药价格降低了很多。如百分之六可湿性“六六六”农药去年为一万五千元一斤，今年每斤则为九千元，降低了六千元。
    山东省合作总社为了充分供应农民“六六六”农药，现已根据农民需要修订了原来的进货计划，又增加了八十万斤，并将原有的“六六六”农药调拨到七个生产资料储运站分头进行供应。
