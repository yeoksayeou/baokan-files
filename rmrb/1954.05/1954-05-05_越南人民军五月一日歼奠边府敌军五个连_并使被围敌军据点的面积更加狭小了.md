Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on May 3rd: In the battles of May 1st where the Vietnamese People's Army captured and controlled four strongholds of the French army at Dien Bien Phu, they killed or wounded up to five companies of enemy soldiers, further reducing the area of the besieged enemy strongholds.

    On the evening of May 1st, the People's Army launched a new offensive against the enemy east of Muong Thanh. After four hours of fighting, the People's Army occupied all of the enemy's trenches and the remaining bunkers on the western side of a small hill, completely annihilating two enemy paratrooper companies defending the area. After a fierce battle, the People's Army also eliminated an important enemy stronghold between this small hill and the Nam Youm River.

    At the same time, the People's Army also launched an offensive against an important French stronghold northwest of Muong Thanh. This stronghold was defended by elite French troops belonging to the 2nd Parachute Battalion of the colonial army. The People's Army quickly annihilated all the defending troops of the stronghold, thereby shrinking the encirclement by another five hundred meters. The People's Army's position now seriously threatens the enemy's artillery positions, and is only about five hundred meters away from the French command in Dien Bien Phu.

    On the same day, in the Hang Kang area south of Dien Bien Phu (its connection with the enemy in Muong Thanh had been severed), the People's Army occupied a French stronghold and destroyed an enemy ammunition depot.

    That evening, the enemy launched several counterattacks in an attempt to retake the lost strongholds, but were repelled by the People's Army and suffered heavy losses.

    Before May 1st, the area of the besieged French strongholds in Muong Thanh had already shrunk to only about 1,700 meters from east to west and only 1,200 meters from north to south. At that time, the enemy still occupied four strongholds on the west side, protecting an artillery position and the French command in Dien Bien Phu; on the east side, they still occupied a small hill and some trenches on the west side of another small hill. After one night of fighting, the area occupied by the enemy in Muong Thanh became even smaller, in some places less than 1,000 meters wide, and in the area controlled by the enemy east of the Nam Youm River, it was even smaller, only 700 meters long and wide.

    越南人民军五月一日歼奠边府敌军五个连
    并使被围敌军据点的面积更加狭小了
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：越南人民军在五月一日攻占和控制奠边府法军的四个据点的战斗中，毙、伤敌军达五连人，并使被围敌军据点的面积更加缩小。
    五月一日晚上，人民军对芒清东面的敌军发动了新的进攻。经过四小时的战斗，人民军占领了所有敌军的交通壕和一个小丘西侧残存的碉堡，全歼防守这一带的两个敌军伞兵连。人民军并在一场激战后，又拔除了这个小丘与约姆河之间的敌军重要据点一处。
    同时，人民军对芒清西北的一个重要法军据点也发动了进攻。这个据点是由属于殖民军第二伞兵营的法军精锐部队防守的。人民军迅速地歼灭了该据点的全部守军，从而把包围圈又紧缩了五百公尺。人民军的阵地现在严重地威胁着敌军的炮兵阵地，离开奠边府法军司令部只约五百公尺。
    同日，在奠边府南部航岗地区（它与芒清敌军的联系已被切断），人民军占领了法军据点一处，并炸毁敌军弹药库一座。
    当天晚上，敌军多次反扑，企图夺回上述失守据点，但都被人民军击退，并遭受很大损失。
    在五月一日以前，芒清法军被围据点的面积已缩小到东西只有大约一千七百公尺，南北只有一千二百公尺。那时，敌军仍占领着西面的掩护着一个炮兵阵地与奠边府法军司令部的四个据点；在东面仍占领着一个小丘以及另一个小丘西侧的一些交通壕。经过一日夜晚战斗后，敌军在芒清占领的地区面积更加狭小了，在有些地方，宽度不到一千公尺，在约姆河以东敌军控制的地区，更小到长、宽各只有七百公尺。
