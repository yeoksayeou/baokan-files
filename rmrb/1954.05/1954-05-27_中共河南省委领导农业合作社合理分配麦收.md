The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is actively leading agricultural production cooperatives to rationally resolve the issue of income distribution during the wheat harvest season. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has organized working groups, led by cadres responsible for the rural work department, such as Shi Xiangsheng, to go deep into key areas to assist cooperatives in rationally carrying out the wheat harvest distribution work. The CPC Luoyang and Xinxiang Prefectural Committees and many county committees have also held special meetings to formulate distribution plans. According to the results of research in various places, there are basically two methods of distribution for this year's wheat harvest season: one is "whoever sows, harvests," those who implement this method generally pay attention to rationally stipulating wages so that labor receives reasonable compensation, and specifically stipulate how to distribute in the autumn to avoid households with more autumn land from suffering losses. At the same time, they pay more attention to properly arranging summer harvesting and planting work and strictly organizing the use of labor, avoiding chaos in the order of summer harvesting and planting. The other is unified distribution by the entire cooperative. Implementing this method requires attention to relying on poor and lower-middle peasants to consolidate the alliance, criticizing egalitarianism among cooperative members, and appropriately taking care of households with more wheat land, larger investments, and better wheat growth. The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anyang County has rationally assessed and compensated for the pre-entry investment in wheat land for new members, and educated members to recognize that the main reason for the increase in actual income this year compared to last year is the labor input that increased land yields. Therefore, everyone unanimously agreed to implement a fixed rent system, based on the number of labor days that should be done throughout the year and the land yield assessment ratio, adopting the method of pre-borrowing wheat and settling accounts once in the autumn, which greatly improved the labor enthusiasm of the members, who asked to conscientiously implement contract farming and production, and piecework payment, so that the cooperative is more consolidated and improved. Now the entire cooperative has made specific plans and full preparations for continuing to strive for increased autumn production for the summer harvest and planting.

    中共河南省委领导农业合作社合理分配麦收
    中共河南省委积极领导农业生产合作社合理解决麦季收益分配问题。中共河南省委已组织工作组，由农村工作部部长史向生等负责干部率领深入重点，协助合作社合理进行麦季分配工作。中共洛阳、新乡地委及不少县委并召开专门会议，制订了分配方案。根据各地研究结果，今年麦季分配办法基本上有两种：一种是谁种谁收，实行这种办法的一般都注意合理规定工资，使劳力得到合理的代价，并具体规定出秋季如何分配，以免大秋地多的户吃亏。同时更注意妥善安排夏收夏种工作和严密组织使用劳力，避免夏收夏种的秩序混乱。另一种是全社统一分配，实行这种办法则须注意根据依靠贫农和中农巩固联盟的原则，批判社员中的平均主义思想，适当照顾麦地多、投资大、麦子长得好的户。安阳县先锋农业生产合作社，把新社员入社前麦地投资进行了合理的作价和补工，并教育社员认识到今年比去年增加实际收入的主要原因，是劳力加工使土地增加了产量，因此一致同意实行死租制，按全年应做劳动日和土地评产比例，采用预借小麦，秋后结账一次分红的办法，大大提高了社员的劳动积极性，纷纷要求认真实行包耕包产，按件记工，使合作社更加巩固与提高。现在全社对夏收夏种继续争取秋季增产都做了具体的计划和充分的准备。
