Thanks to the warm weather last winter and the abundant rainfall this spring, wheat is generally growing well in various parts of Shaanxi Province. In the Guanzhong area, known as the "Eight Hundred Li Qin Chuan," wheat is growing particularly strong, and most wheat fields are now earing and flowering. In the plain areas of southern Shaanxi, wheat flowering has passed and is beginning to fill and ripen; in the mountain areas, wheat ears are also about to emerge completely. Winter wheat is also growing vigorously in northern Shaanxi.

Currently, peasants in various areas are enthusiastically preparing for the summer harvest. Many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams have formulated summer harvest plans and are actively repairing farm tools. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Abaocai, Yao County, has decided that large farm tools such as carts and trailers will be repaired by the cooperative, while small farm tools for the general summer harvest will still be prepared by the cooperative members themselves. The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County has designated a custodian to be responsible for inspecting and repairing four carts and ropes. The production team leaders are responsible for supervising each household to repair seventy-five small farm tools for the summer harvest. Female cooperative members are responsible for repairing a total of one hundred and fifty-eight pockets and fifty mat barns. In order to solve the difficulty for women in taking care of their babies during the summer harvest, agricultural cooperatives in Dali, Hua County, Weinan, Liquan, Xingping, and Xianyang counties have all decided to organize busy season nurseries and baby-holding groups. The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County has decided to organize a baby-holding group, with twelve women dividing thirty-three boys and girls in the whole cooperative into five nurseries. These cooperatives have also discussed the rational organization and allocation of labor in the summer harvest in advance, so that they can not only complete the summer harvest well, but also ensure the protection of cotton and other crops; and discussed how to raise vigilance to prevent fires and prevent sabotage by bad people. In addition, all localities attach great importance to wheat seed selection this year, and many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams have included summer selection as a major item in the summer harvest plan.

    陕西省各地农民热烈准备夏收
    由于去冬气候温暖，今春雨水充沛，陕西各地小麦普遍成长良好。号称“八百里秦川”的关中地区，小麦生长特别健壮，现在大部分麦田已吐穗扬花。陕南平川地区小麦扬花已过，开始灌浆结实；山原地区小麦穗亦将出齐。陕北各地冬小麦也生长茁壮。
    目前，各地农民正热烈准备夏收。许多农业社和互助组已订出夏收计划，并积极修补农具，耀县阿堡寨五星农业社决定大车、拉拉车等大农具由社修补，一般夏收的小农具仍由社员自己准备。醴泉县星火农业社将四辆大车和绳套等，已指定保管员负责检查补修，七十五件夏收小农具由各生产小组长负责督促各户修理好。全社共有一百五十八条口袋、五十个席囤由女社员负责修补。为了解决妇女夏收照顾娃娃的困难，大荔、华县、渭南、醴泉、兴平、咸阳等县农业社都已决定组织农忙托儿所、抱娃组。醴泉县星火农业社决定组织一个抱娃组，全社三十三个男女小孩，由十二个妇女分五处地方保育。这些社并都提早讨论了夏收中劳力的合理组织分配，既要很好地完成夏收，也要保证做好棉花等作物的保苗工作；并讨论了如何提高警惕预防火灾和防止坏人破坏。另外，各地对今年小麦选种都很重视，许多农业社和互助组把夏选工作都列为夏收计划中的主要项目。
