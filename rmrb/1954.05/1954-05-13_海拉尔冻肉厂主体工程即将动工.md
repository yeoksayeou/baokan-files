The city of Hailar in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is building a frozen meat factory. The factory's ancillary projects began construction last year. Currently, the main building materials required for the main project have been mostly prepared, and construction can begin after the design drawings are issued.

Since liberation, animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has developed greatly. Every year, in addition to what is kept for breeding and for consumption by herdsmen themselves, a large amount of beef, mutton, and non-staple food products can be supplied to the region and throughout the country. According to statistics, the Hulunbuir League alone supplied more than 80,000 head of cattle and more than 300,000 sheep in 1952. However, due to limited conditions, the vast majority of cattle and sheep must be transported to Harbin in the Northeast for processing. During transportation and while waiting for processing, the loss rate of cattle and sheep is 15% to 20%, which also affects timely supply. After the Hailar Frozen Meat Factory goes into production, the current situation can be changed. People will be able to eat large quantities of fresh beef and mutton produced by the factory all year round.

The Hailar Frozen Meat Factory is divided into two parts: slaughtering and freezing, both of which are equipped with modern machinery. Cattle are driven from the pasture into the slaughterhouse. After passing through a tipping point, a crane lifts them up and sends them to the slaughter workers. After slaughtering, the workers press a button, and the crane sends the cattle to the workers at the second process to be skinned. After that, the process continues through evisceration, oil removal, dismemberment, washing, disease inspection, weighing, and finally entering the freezing room. This process only takes 30 to 40 minutes; the slaughterhouse can slaughter 80 cattle and 600 sheep in eight hours a day.

After the crane sends the pieces of beef and mutton to the freezing room, they are loaded into an air cooler to dry the moisture on the meat, and then loaded into the freezer. After 24 hours, the meat is frozen. After the factory is completed, scheduled refrigerated trains will enter the factory on dedicated railway lines to transport hundreds and thousands of tons of frozen meat to various places to meet the people's needs for beef, mutton, and non-staple food products.

### 海拉尔冻肉厂主体工程即将动工

    海拉尔冻肉厂主体工程即将动工
    内蒙古自治区海拉尔市正在建筑一座冻肉厂。该厂的附属工程自去年就开始动工。目前主体工程所需的主要建筑材料已大部准备停当，待设计图纸下达后即可施工。
    解放后几年来，内蒙古自治区的畜牧业有很大的发展，每年除了留繁殖和牧民自己食用外，可以供应本区及全国各地大量牛羊肉副食品；据统计，仅呼伦贝尔盟在一九五二年便供应了八万多头牛，三十余万只羊。但由于条件限制，绝大部分的牛羊须运至东北哈尔滨加工，在运送途中和等待加工期间，牛羊的损耗率为百分之十五到二十，且影响及时供应。海拉尔冻肉厂投入生产后，就可改变目前的情况。人们在一年四季中，都能吃到该厂生产的大量的鲜牛肉和鲜羊肉。
    海拉尔冻肉厂分屠宰和冷冻两个部分，都是现代化机械装备。一头头的牛，从牧场被赶进屠宰场，经过有翻板的地方，吊车便把它吊起来，送到屠宰工人那里；屠宰完毕，工人一按电钮，吊车又把这头牛送到第二道工序工人那里剥皮。如此，再经过剖膛、摘油、解体、水洗、检疾、过秤等工序，最后送入冷冻室。这个过程只需三十分到四十分钟；一天八小时屠宰场可屠宰八十头牛，六百只羊。
    吊车把一块块牛羊肉送到冷冻室后，装进风库，把肉上的水分吹干，再装进冷冻室。二十四小时后，肉便冻结成了。待该厂建成后，定时的冷藏列车，由专用铁道开进厂内来，把成百成千吨冻肉运往各地，满足人民对牛羊肉副食品的需要。
