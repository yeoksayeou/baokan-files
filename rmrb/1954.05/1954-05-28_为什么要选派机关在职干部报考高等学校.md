Why Select and Send Cadres Currently Employed in Government Organs to Apply for Universities

Zhang Jian, Deputy Director of the Planning and Finance Department of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government

In order to successfully complete the 1954 national university enrollment task and ensure an appropriate improvement in the quality of this year's new students, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National University Enrollment Plan," requiring the selection of outstanding graduates from secondary vocational schools and cadres currently employed in Party, government, and people's organizations at the county level and above to apply for universities. This decision is not only of great significance to this year's university enrollment work but also to the gradual change in the composition of university students and the improvement of the professional abilities of cadres currently employed in government organs in the future. To correctly implement this decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, leading organs at the county level and above nationwide should conduct necessary research on the following two questions: Why select and send cadres currently employed in government organs to apply for universities? What problems should be paid attention to when selecting and sending cadres currently employed in government organs to apply for admission?

I. Why Select and Send Cadres Currently Employed in Government Organs to Apply for Universities

Selecting and sending cadres currently employed in government organs to apply for universities is not only necessary this year due to the shortage of senior high school and worker-peasant rapid middle school graduates to meet university enrollment needs, but it will also remain necessary even when there is a surplus of senior high school and worker-peasant rapid middle school graduates in the future. This is understandable because:

First, because cadres currently employed in government organs have undergone education by the Party and the government and practical work experience, they are more easily trained to become the backbone of the national construction talent pool after entering universities. This is because they have higher political awareness than general young students, possess a certain level of policy understanding, and have relatively strong comprehension due to having a certain amount of practical work experience, allowing them to accept advanced Soviet experience more quickly. Therefore, selecting and sending cadres currently employed in government organizations to apply for universities is one of the effective methods to actively improve the quality of university students, thereby improving the quality of future national construction talent.

Second, the development of national construction undertakings will place increasingly higher demands on the leadership work of Party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels. For example, government departments responsible for leading industrial construction not only need politically strong leadership backbones but also need to be equipped with a group of technical cadres who understand industrial production. Even among grassroots trade union cadres, there is a need for people with a certain amount of industrial production knowledge (some trade union cadres in the Soviet Union are engineers and technicians). To enable Party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels to gradually equip themselves with a group of cadres who are proficient in their respective fields, it is not only necessary to absorb general young students for training but, more importantly, to select cadres with longer working experience and more experience to enter universities for advanced studies. After they graduate and return to work in similar types of positions, they will greatly improve the leadership level of these organizations or enterprises.

Third, selecting and sending cadres currently employed in government organizations to universities, giving them the opportunity for further education, is one of the effective ways to systematically improve the political and theoretical level and professional abilities of cadres currently employed. Although this method is currently limited to a small number of people due to various limitations (such as the needs of government work, the inability of cadres to leave, and the limited capacity of schools), and therefore is not the main method of cultivating and improving cadres currently employed, we must also give it sufficient attention.

Precisely because selecting and sending cadres currently employed in government organizations to universities can cultivate the backbone of advanced construction talent, improve the leadership level of government organizations, and provide cadres currently employed with the opportunity for further education, this is not only required by national construction but also hoped for by the majority of young cadres currently employed. Since 1950, the government has transferred approximately 30,000 cadres currently employed and cadres currently employed who have automatically applied for schools (including 14,000 in 1952). Some of these people have already graduated (two-year specialized courses) and become the backbone of the national construction talent pool, playing an active role in various positions; those who are still studying in schools are also mostly the backbone forces among the students.

II. What Problems Need to Be Solved When Selecting and Sending Cadres Currently Employed in Government Organs to Apply for Universities

To ensure the implementation of the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National University Enrollment Plan" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the following issues should be addressed:

First, leading organs at all levels should consider the work of selecting and sending cadres to universities from the overall interests of national construction. To build our motherland into a great socialist country, we should expend effort to solve the problem of training technical cadres, and selecting and sending cadres currently employed in government organizations to apply for universities is one of the main ways to cultivate the backbone of national advanced construction talent. That is to say, to accelerate the process of national socialist industrialization, we should select outstanding cadres from our units to apply for universities. The practice of departmentalism, which only considers the immediate interests of one's own unit, is unwilling to select and send cadres to universities, or adopts the method of "dumping baggage" by sending people who are not eligible for admission to apply, is incorrect. Although many government organizations have proceeded from the overall interests of national construction and sent many outstanding cadres to universities in the past, some government organizations have also sent people with health problems, poor political qualities, and those who do not meet the admission requirements to apply, in an attempt to achieve the goal of "dumping baggage." These people are of course not easily admitted, and even if some people are reluctantly admitted, they often take long-term leave, or have difficulty continuing their studies due to family problems or poor grades. This not only affects the country's training plan for advanced construction talent, causing a great waste of human and financial resources (note: the cost of training a university student is 40 million to 75 million yuan), but also creates negative and pessimistic emotions in the cadres themselves. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly instructed: Those who are not admitted should still return to work in their original units, and the original sending unit must not refuse to take care of them.

Second, we must overcome all difficulties and ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by higher authorities in terms of both quantity and quality. Today, many government organizations feel that the tasks are heavy and the manpower is insufficient. Now, it is necessary to select outstanding cadres to apply for universities, which is certainly not a simple matter. This requires more active thinking: studying work methods, improving work efficiency; finding ways to adjust some cadres whose cultural level is relatively low but can take over the work of those who do receiving, dispatching, clerical work, section members, and administrative secretaries, etc., who have equivalent senior high school education, so that the latter can go to school. As long as we think of some ways, not only can units that are gradually streamlining and tightening up their organizations be able to draw people, but even units that need to replenish manpower can also draw some people.

Third, it is necessary to do the necessary education and organizational work for cadres currently employed who meet the admission requirements (equivalent to senior high school level, politically progressive, healthy, and actively working). First of all, we must educate them to establish a correct view of going to school. It must be explained to them that the organization wants everyone to apply for universities to meet the needs of the entire national construction, especially industrial construction; they must be told that not only must they obtain the consent of the responsible comrades of their own organizations before applying, but they must also consciously obey the unified allocation of the country after being admitted. Applying for admission cannot be for the pursuit of personal fame and gain, nor can it excessively emphasize personal interests and hobbies. Secondly, it must be explained to them that after applying for admission, they must go through a rather long and arduous learning process before they can have a certain level of Marxist-Leninist theory and a certain specialized knowledge and skills. They must be fully prepared ideologically for the relatively difficult living conditions in schools (such as living in more crowded houses than in government organs) and the relatively tense learning. They must never rely only on momentary enthusiasm, so that they will not feel uneasy about learning when they encounter difficulties in their studies in the future.

As for the organizational work, three things must be done well: first, those who have been approved to apply for the examination should be given a certain amount of time to review the necessary courses in accordance with the examination syllabus for each subject issued by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government in conjunction with the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. Because they have mostly forgotten the subjects they have learned in the past, they will definitely encounter great difficulties during the examination if they are not given time to make up for them; second, they are responsible for reviewing the various conditions of the cadres currently employed who are preparing to apply for the examination, and they must go for physical examinations, prepare the necessary documents, and consult with the local enrollment agencies about the application procedures; third, the work undertaken by the cadres currently employed who are preparing to apply for admission must be re-arranged, not only must specific personnel be designated to take over their work, but also how to arrange their work when they fail the examination and return to their original organs must be considered. In short, they must be allowed to apply for the examination without any worries.

Fourth, Party and government organs and people's organizations at the county level and above nationwide should immediately start preparing to select and send cadres currently employed to apply for universities based on the work situation and cadre conditions of their units. Because the university entrance examination this year will be held around July 15, time is extremely tight, and relevant departments in various places should seize the time to carry out this work, so as not to delay the examination period. We believe that as long as everyone conscientiously implements the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National University Enrollment Plan" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the university enrollment plan this year can not only be completed on schedule, but also appropriately improve the quality of new students.

    为什么要选派机关在职干部报考高等学校
    中央人民政府高等教育部计划财务司副司长　张健
    为着顺利地完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生任务，并保证适当地提高今年新生的质量，中共中央曾作出“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”，要求选拔中等专业学校优秀的毕业生及县级以上党、政机关和人民团体在职干部报考高等学校。这个决定不但对于今年的高等学校招生工作有重大的意义，就是对今后逐步改变高等学校学生成份、提高机关在职干部的业务能力，都有很大的意义。为着正确地执行中共中央这一决定，全国县级以上领导机关应对下列两个问题进行必要的研究：为什么要选派机关在职干部报考高等学校？选派机关在职干部报考入学时要注意解决那些问题？
    一、为什么要选派机关在职
      干部报考高等学校
    选派机关在职干部报考高等学校，不但在今年高级中学及工农速成中学毕业生不足高等学校招生的需要时是必要的，即使在将来高级中学及工农速成中学毕业生有富余时也仍然是必要的。这是可以理解的。因为：
    第一、由于机关在职干部经过党和政府的教育和实际工作的锻炼，他们升入高等学校后，更容易培养成为国家建设人才队伍中的骨干。因为他们比之一般青年学生政治觉悟较高，具有一定的政策水平，又因为有一定的实际工作经验，理解力较强，接受苏联先进经验较快。因此，选派机关团体在职干部报考高等学校，是积极改进高等学校学生质量从而提高未来的国家建设人才质量的有效方法之一。
    第二、国家建设事业的发展，将对各级党政机关及人民团体的领导工作水平，提出愈来愈高的要求。例如负责领导工业建设的政府部门，就不仅需要有政治上较强的领导骨干，而且需要配备一批懂得工业生产的技术干部。就是在基层工会干部中，也需要具有一定工业生产知识的人（苏联有些工会干部就是工程师、技术人员）。要使各级党政机关及人民团体能够逐步配备一批精通本门业务的干部，不但需要吸收一般青年学生加以培养，特别重要的是选派工作时间较长、经验较多的干部进入高等学校深造。他们在毕业以后返回同类性质的工作岗位，就会大大提高这些机关团体或企业工作的领导水平。
    第三、选派机关团体在职干部入学，给他们以深造的机会，乃是系统地提高在职干部的政治理论水平和业务能力的有效办法之一。尽管由于各种条件的限制（如机关工作需要，干部离不开，学校的容量有限），当前这种方式还只能限于少数人，因而还不是培养和提高在职干部的主要方法，我们也必须给以足够的重视。
    正因为选派机关团体在职干部入学能够培养高级建设人才的骨干，能够提高机关团体的领导水平，能够给予在职干部以入学深造的机会，所以这不仅为国家建设所要求，也为大多数青年在职干部所希望。自一九五○年以来，政府抽调在职干部和在职干部本人自动报考学校的约有三万人左右（其中一九五二年就有一万四千人）。这些人有的已经毕业（二年制专修科），成为国家建设人才队伍中的骨干，在各种工作岗位上，发挥了积极作用；其仍在学校学习者，也大都是在校学生中的中坚力量。
  二、选派机关在职干部报考
        高等学校要解决那些问题
    要保证贯彻中共中央“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”，应该注意解决下列问题：
    第一、各级领导机关应从国家整个建设利益出发，来考虑本单位选派干部入学的工作。要把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，就应该花力量来解决技术干部的培养问题，而选派机关团体在职干部报考高等学校，正是培养国家高级建设人才骨干的主要办法之一。这就是说，要想加速国家社会主义工业化的过程，就应该选派本单位优秀的干部去报考高等学校。那种只从本单位眼前利益出发，不愿选派干部入学，或是采取“丢包袱”的办法，将不能入学的人送去报考的本位主义作法，是不对的。过去虽然有很多机关团体从国家整个建设利益出发，选送了许多优秀干部入学；但也有一些机关团体将那些身体有病的、政治品质不好、不合乎入学条件的人送去报考，企图达到“丢包袱”的目的。这些人当然不易被录取，即使某些人被勉强录取入学，也常常是长期休养，或因家庭问题，或因成绩太差而难于继续坚持学习。这不但影响国家对高级建设人才的培养计划，造成人力和财力（按：培养一个大学生共需费用四千万元至七千五百万元）的很大的浪费，而且也会使干部本人产生消极悲观情绪。故中共中央指示中明确规定：未考取者仍回原机关工作，原选送机关不得拒绝不管。
    第二、要克服一切困难，从数量到质量都要保证完成上级分配的任务。今天不少机关团体都感觉到任务繁重，人力不足，现在又要选派优秀的干部去报考高等学校，当然这不是很简单的事。这就需要更多地想些积极办法：研究工作方法，提高工作效率；设法调整一些文化水平虽然较低，但可以接替那些做收发、干事、科员、事务秘书等工作的、相当于高中文化程度的干部，好让后者去升学。只要想些办法，不但正在逐步地精简紧缩机构的单位可以抽得出人来，就连那些需要补充人力的单位也可以抽出一些人来。
    第三、必须向具有入学条件（相当于高中程度、政治上进步、身体健康、工作积极）的在职干部做好必要的教育工作和组织工作。首先要教育他们树立正确的升学观点。要向他们说明：组织上要大家去报考高等学校，是为了适应国家整个建设首先是工业建设的需要；要告诉他们，不但报考之前，要征得本机关负责同志的同意；考取之后，也要自觉地服从国家的统一分配。报考入学既不能为了追求个人的名利，也不能过分地强调个人的兴趣和爱好。其次，要向他们说明报考入学后，要经过一个相当长的艰苦学习的过程，才能够具有一定的马克思列宁主义的理论水平和某一种专门知识技能，对于学校中比较艰苦的生活条件（例如住的房子比机关要拥挤等）和学习比较紧张要有充分的思想准备，决不要只凭一时的热情，以致将来在学习中遇到困难时又不安心学习。
    至于在组织工作方面则须要做好三件事：一是要给予业经批准报考的人一定的时间，来根据中央人民政府高等教育部会同中央教育部所颁发的各科考试大纲复习必要的课程。因为他们对过去所学的功课多半都遗忘了，假如不给予补习时间，到考试时一定会遇到很大的困难；二是负责审查准备去报考的在职干部的各种条件，并要他们去进行体格检查、准备好必要的证件，和当地招生机构商谈报考手续；三是要将准备报考入学的在职干部所担负的工作，重新加以安排，既要指定专人接替他们的工作，又要考虑他们考不取返回原机关时如何安排他们的工作。总之，要使他们毫无顾虑地去报考。
    第四、全国县级以上党政机关和人民团体应即根据本单位的工作情况和干部条件着手准备选派在职干部报考高等学校。因为今年高等学校的考试将于七月十五日前后举行，时间极为紧迫，各地有关部门应抓紧进行此项工作，以免耽误考期。我们相信，只要大家认真贯彻中共中央关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定，今年高等学校招生计划不但能够按期完成，而且还能够适当地提高新生质量。
