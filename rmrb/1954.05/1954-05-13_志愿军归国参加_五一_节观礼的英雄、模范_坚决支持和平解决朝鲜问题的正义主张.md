    [Report from this newspaper] Some of the well-known combat heroes and model workers from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army "May 1st" National Day Observation Delegation are highly concerned about the discussions on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference. They unanimously believe that the suggestions put forward by DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il and the speeches made by Foreign Ministers Molotov and Zhou Enlai on the Korean question are the basis for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Wang Yanlin, a Second-Class Hero, said: "Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference fully expressed the aspirations of our 500 million people who love peace. We fully support it, and we also fully support Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal. The peaceful reunification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people themselves. No one should interfere in Korea's internal affairs. All foreign troops should withdraw from Korea and let the Korean people realize free elections throughout Korea." The heroes and models unanimously condemned the US representative's lack of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean question and their attempt to resume the Korean War. Cao Yuntao, a model telegraph operator, said: "Why does Dulles say that the United States is too far from Korea and that it is not easy to return after the troops withdraw? Isn't this a clear proof that American imperialism wants to rule Korea for a long time! This kind of American aggressive conspiracy is a great threat to the security and peace of Asia, and we firmly oppose it." Yao Xian, a Second-Class Model of the Air Force, said: "The plan for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il is completely reasonable, and peace-loving people all over the world will support this fair proposal. If the American aggressive clique does not accept the lessons of its failure in the Korean War, ignores this just proposal supported by people all over the world, and continues its aggressive acts, then they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats. We advocate peace, and we also have the strength to defend peace." Pan Changyi, a Second-Class Hero who was wounded several times in the battle to counterattack "Cross" Mountain in June last year and insisted on fighting, using his machine gun to cover his comrades in capturing the main peak, Huang Zongde, a Second-Class Hero who led a squad to capture the No. 5 position and captured 22 enemies in the battle to counterattack the Zhuzidong Nanshan in July last year, and Yang Daogen, a Second-Class Hero, Su Zhiming, a driver who has driven safely for more than 50,000 kilometers and won first-class merit, and others, all angrily refuted the slander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army by the United States and its puppet countries. Huang Zongde said: "The US representative shamelessly slandered our people's just action of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea at the Geneva Conference. In fact, it was none other than the United States and its accomplice countries that invaded Korea. The United States transported troops across the ocean to Korea. Isn't this an invasion? And we Chinese people only rose up to volunteer to aid Korea and resist aggression when the flames of war were burning at our doorstep, our national security was seriously threatened, and we could no longer tolerate it. Isn't this a very obvious fact? Now, right at the Geneva Conference, American imperialism is still continuing to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. We firmly oppose it." The Volunteer Army heroes and models all hope that the Geneva Conference can reach an agreement on a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and told the people of the motherland that all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army are always on high alert against the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism. They are determined to fight to smash the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    志愿军归国参加“五一”节观礼的英雄、模范
    坚决支持和平解决朝鲜问题的正义主张
   【本报讯】中国人民志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团一部分著名的战斗英雄和工作模范，十分关注日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论。他们一致认为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相提出的建议和莫洛托夫外长、周恩来外长对朝鲜问题的发言，是和平解决朝鲜问题的基础。二级英雄王彦林说：“周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言，充分表达了我国五万万人民爱好和平的心愿，我们完全拥护，同时我们也完全支持南日外务相的建议。和平统一朝鲜是朝鲜人民自己的事情，任何人都不应干涉朝鲜的内政，一切外国军队都应该撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己实现全朝鲜的自由选举。”英雄、模范们一致斥责美国代表对和平解决朝鲜问题缺乏诚意，企图恢复朝鲜战争的行为。模范译电员曹筠陶说：“为什么杜勒斯竟说美国距离朝鲜太远，军队撤退后回来不易呢？这还不是美帝国主义要想长期统治朝鲜的明证吗！美国这种侵略阴谋，对于亚洲的安全与和平是极大的威胁，我们坚决反对。”空军二级模范耀先说：“南日外务相提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的方案，是完全合理的，全世界爱好和平的人民都会支持这个公平建议。美国侵略集团如果不接受在朝鲜战争中失败的教训，无视这个为全世界人民所支持的公正建议，继续其侵略行为，那么他们必然会遭到更加惨重的失败。我们主张和平，我们也有力量来保卫和平。”在去年六月反击“十字架”山战斗中数次负伤坚持战斗、并以机枪掩护战友夺下主峰的二级英雄潘昌义，去年七月反击注字洞南山战斗中率领一个班攻下五号阵地、俘掳敌人二十二名的二级英雄黄宗德，和二级英雄杨道根，安全行车五万多公里荣立一等功的司机苏志铭等，都愤怒地驳斥了美国及其仆从国家的代表对中国人民志愿军的诬蔑，黄宗德说：“美国代表在日内瓦会议无耻地诽谤我国人民抗美援朝的正义行动，事实上侵略朝鲜的不是别人，正是美国及其帮凶国家。美国远涉重洋把军队运到朝鲜来，这不是侵略是什么呢？而我们中国人民是在战火烧到家门、祖国的安全受到严重威胁、忍无可忍时，才起来志愿援朝，反抗侵略的。这不是很明显的事实吗。现在，就在日内瓦会议上，美帝国主义还在继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。我们坚决反对。”志愿军英雄和模范们都希望日内瓦会议能够就和平解决朝鲜问题达成协议，并告诉祖国人民，志愿军全体指战员对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋随时保持着高度的警惕，他们坚决为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋、为争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。
