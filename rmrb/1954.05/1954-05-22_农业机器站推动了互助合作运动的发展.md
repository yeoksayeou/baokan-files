    Within the eastern part of the Huang Fan (Yellow River flooded) area in Henan Province, there are several large wheat fields that are growing exceptionally well. Local farmers describe them this way: "You can only see the wheat ears, not the leaves. When you push on this side of the field, the other side moves." These fields are being cultivated by the Xihua Agricultural Machinery Station in Henan Province and the Fourth Work Station of the State-owned Huang Fan Area Farm for the Ling Heini Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Gao Yumei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanling Village, Xihua County, and the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bianzhuang Village, Fugou County.

    The Xihua Agricultural Machinery Station cultivated 964 mu of land for the Ling Heini Agricultural Production Cooperative and 273 mu of land for the Gao Yumei Agricultural Production Cooperative. The Fourth Work Station of the State-owned Huang Fan Area Farm cultivated 46 mu of land for the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative. All of this started last autumn during the wheat planting season. When the tractors, dragging five-bottom plows, rumbled into the fields of Nanling Village, it aroused great interest among the villagers. Hundreds of people followed the tractors, watching and chattering. Some even carefully measured the width and depth of the tractor plows. When they saw that the tractor plowed more than five chi (about 5.4 feet) wide and more than nine cun (about 11 inches) deep in one pass, they were amazed and clicked their tongues. They discussed: "Old-style plows only plow six or seven cun wide, at most five cun deep," "The tractor-plowed land has a flat bottom and no ridges, with even depth; the old plow's furrows have a pointed bottom and are uneven in depth." When the tractor dragged the disc harrow to crush and level the ground, and then dragged the seed drill to sow the seeds, the farmers of Nanling Village were even more surprised. The Ling Heini Agricultural Production Cooperative had a field of more than 500 mu. The Soviet-style 24-row seed drill sowed on this field, sowing nine mu in one pass, which only took more than ten minutes. Everyone praised it, saying: Machine cultivation is fast and good. Using an old-style drill requires two people and a horse, working diligently for a whole day.

    After seeing machine cultivation, some farmers in Nanling Village were already planning to ask the machinery station to cultivate their land next year.

    The farmers of Nanling Village and Bianzhuang Village were very concerned about the machine-cultivated wheat. Whenever they had time, they would sneak into the cultivated fields to take a look. When relatives came, they would also take them to visit the cultivated fields. They also compared it with their own wheat. Some production experts in Nanling Village were initially not convinced by machine cultivation. For example, Ling Fuxing of the Ling Heini Agricultural Production Cooperative initially said: "The machines plant too densely and then roll over it with a roller, which destroys the wheat seeds and will certainly not produce grain." But after the wheat seedlings sprouted, the seedlings in the cultivated fields emerged uniformly and grew vigorously, while one-third of the two mu of wheat planted by Ling Chang, the village's top production expert, was missing. Ling Fuxing's understanding changed, and he changed the topic to "It's guaranteed to produce more grain." Farmers in the surrounding villages also said: The wheat seedlings cover the ground, it will definitely increase production. This spring, the agricultural machinery station also spring-harrowed the cultivated wheat, and after two spring rains, the wheat grew particularly vigorously. Recently, they measured it and estimated that although the soil quality of these fields is not good, it is estimated that each mu can still yield an average of more than 180 jin. This is more than 30 jin more than the wheat cultivated by the farmers themselves. Therefore, when the farmers of Nanling Village mentioned the cultivated land, they all smiled. The machine-cultivated wheat of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bianzhuang Village was sown using the "cross method," and it grew even more densely. After the farm's technicians calculated the yield, they estimated that each mu could yield at least 350 to 400 jin on average. The farmers of Bianzhuang Village were overjoyed when they heard this number. Kang, an elderly member of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, couldn't even sleep, and shouted to her son in the middle of the night, "I've been in our village for decades, and I've never seen a mu of land that can yield hundreds of jin!"

    The machine-cultivated wheat grew well, and many farmers hoped that their land could also be cultivated. But everyone felt that the machines belonged to the farm and could not be used by the farmers! Last year, after the Fourth Work Station of the Huang Fan Area Farm cultivated for the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, the farmers in Bianzhuang Village suddenly understood. Old man Guan Zhuosheng often smiled and said to the villagers: "The machine has come to the cooperative, our whole village will not worry!" The members of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative were even more happy beyond description. Some members, when they saw people, would raise their thumbs and wag their heads, saying: "Hey! Our cooperative is led by the state-owned farm!" Now many farmers know that agricultural machinery stations and farms only cultivate for agricultural production cooperatives, because agricultural production cooperatives use land as shares, and only by combining the scattered land into large pieces can machines be used. So everyone discussed forming agricultural production cooperatives. The better mutual aid teams in Nanling Village merged into a large one this spring, and requested the approval of the Xihua County People's Government to establish three agricultural production cooperatives. The number of cooperative households in Nanling Village suddenly increased from the original 68 to 154, accounting for 69.92 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the village. Bianzhuang Village has a total of 68 farm households. In addition to the 14 households participating in the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, the remaining 54 households all wanted to join the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative. After review, only three households were admitted. Although the remaining farmers were mostly members of mutual aid teams, their mutual aid teams had not been run well in the past, and some did not even have a work evaluation and point recording system, which did not meet the conditions for joining the cooperative. The members of the mutual aid team were not discouraged. They said: It doesn't matter, we will work hard to run the team well, create conditions and strive to transfer to the cooperative next year. More than 20 individual farmers also regretted their lack of foresight and joined the mutual aid team. Now all the farmers in Bianzhuang Village are organized. Of the seven mutual aid teams, six have already begun to implement work evaluation and point recording. Around the Fourth Work Station of the State-owned Huang Fan Area Farm, farmers in villages such as Yanggang, Gucheng, Zhangwugang, and Xuzhuang are also actively organizing. Many people went to the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative to learn from their experience in establishing a cooperative. Soon, three new agricultural production cooperatives and many mutual aid teams appeared. All 42 farm households in Xuzhuang Village also joined the mutual aid team. These newly established agricultural production cooperatives are all discussing with nearby farmers about exchanging land, planning to combine it into large pieces, and planning to ask the Xihua Agricultural Machinery Station and the Fourth Work Station of the State-owned Huang Fan Area Farm to cultivate for them in the autumn planting season.

    农业机器站推动了互助合作运动的发展
    新华社记者　朱炜
    在河南省黄泛区东部内，有几大块小麦长得特别好。当地农民这样形容它：“只见麦穗不见叶，在地这边推，地那边就动。”这几块地是由河南省西华农业机器站和国营黄泛区农场第四作业站给西华县南凌村凌黑妮农业生产合作社、高玉梅农业生产合作社和扶沟县汴庄村先锋农业生产合作社代耕的。
    西华农业机器站给凌黑妮农业生产合作社代耕的土地有九百六十四亩，给高玉梅农业生产合作社代耕的土地有二百七十三亩；国营黄泛区农场第四作业站为先锋农业生产合作社代耕的土地有四十六亩；都是在去年秋天种麦时开始的。当拖拉机拖着五铧犁轰轰隆隆地开进南凌村代耕的地里时，引起了全村农民极大的兴趣，几百个人闹嚷嚷地跟在拖拉机后边观看，有的人还仔细地测量着拖拉机犁的宽度和深度。当他们看到拖拉机开过，一趟就犁五尺多宽，九寸多深，都惊喜得咂起嘴来，纷纷议论：“旧式犁一趟只犁六七寸宽，至多五寸来深”，“拖拉机犁的地，犁沟是平底，没有格子，深浅均匀；旧犁的犁沟是尖底，忽深忽浅”。当拖拉机拖着圆盘耙把地耙碎耙平，而后又拖着条播机播种时，南凌村的农民更加惊奇了。凌黑妮农业生产合作社有一块五百多亩的地，苏联式二十四行条播机在这块地上播种，一来一回就是九亩，费的时间却只有十几分钟。大家看了，一致称赞，都说：机器耕种又快又好，要用旧式耧播种，需要两个人，一匹马，踏踏实实地干一天才行。
    南凌村的农民看到机器耕作后，有些人当时就盘算着明年也请机器站代耕。
    对于机器代耕的小麦，南凌村和汴庄村的农民非常关心，一有空就溜到代耕地里去看，亲戚们来了，也把他们引到代耕地里去参观。他们还跟自己种的小麦作对比。南凌村有几个生产能手，原先并不服气机器耕种，例如凌黑妮农业生产合作社的凌福兴最初就这样说：“机器种的太稠，还用镇压器轧轧，是毁麦种的，保准不打粮。”可是在小麦发芽后，代耕地的麦苗出的齐，长的旺，而全村第一把生产能手凌长种的二亩小麦却缺苗三分之一。凌福兴认识转变了，就把话题改为“保准多打粮”了。周围各村的农民也都说：麦苗铺满地，一定要增产。今春，农业机器站又把代耕小麦进行了春耙，又得了两场春雨，小麦长得格外旺盛。最近他们测算了一下，虽然这些地的土质不好，可是估计每亩平均还可收一百八十多斤。要比农民自耕的小麦多产三十多斤。因此，南凌村的农民提起代耕地，就都眉开眼笑。汴庄村先锋农业生产合作社的代耕小麦，是采用“交叉法”播种的，长得更是茂密。农场的技术员测算了产量以后，估计每亩平均至少可收三百五十斤至四百斤。汴庄村农民听到这个数字，喜欢得阖不拢嘴。先锋农业生产合作社的社员康老大娘竟然连觉也睡不着，半夜里还喊着儿子说：“我到咱村几十年，也没见过一亩地能打几百斤！”。
    代耕的小麦长得好，很多农民都想着自己的地也能代耕才好。可是大家都觉得：机器是农场的，农民不能使用！去年种麦时，黄泛区农场第四作业站给先锋农业生产合作社代耕以后，汴庄村的农民们一下子心里都壑亮了。关卓生老大爷时常笑着对村人说：“机器开到社里了，咱全村就不愁了！”先锋农业生产合作社的社员们更是高兴的难以形容。有的社员见了人就跷起大拇指幌着脑袋说：“咳！俺社是国营农场领导的！”现在许多农民都知道：农业机器站和农场只给农业生产合作社代耕，因为农业生产合作社是土地入股，把分散的土地合成大块才能使用机器。于是大家就都商量着成立农业生产合作社。南凌村较好的互助组今春就来了一个大合并，请求西华县人民政府批准，成立了三个农业生产合作社。南凌村合作化的农户一下子就由原来的六十八户上升到一百五十四户，占这个村农业总户数的百分之六十九点九二弱。汴庄村共有六十八户农民，除参加先锋农业生产合作社的十四户外，其余五十四户农民都想加入先锋农业生产合作社，经过审查只吸收了三户。其余的农户虽然大都是互助组的组员，可是他们的互助组过去办的不好，有的连评工记分制度都没有，不够入社条件。互助组组员并不灰心，他们说：这不要紧，我们努力把组办好，创造条件争取明年转社。二十几户单干农民也怨恨自己太没有远见，因而加入了互助组。现在汴庄村的农民全都组织起来了。七个互助组，六个已经开始实行评工记分。在国营黄泛区农场第四作业站的周围，扬岗、古城、张坞岗、徐庄等村的农民也积极组织起来。许多人跑到先锋农业生产合作社吸取建社经验。不久就有三个新的农业生产合作社和许多互助组出现。徐庄村四十二户农民也全部参加了互助组。这些新成立的农业生产合作社都正在和附近农民商量着调换土地，打算合成大块，计划种秋时就请西华农业机器站和国营黄泛区农场第四作业站进行代耕。
