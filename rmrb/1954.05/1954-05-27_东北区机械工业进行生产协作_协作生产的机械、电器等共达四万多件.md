    Northeast China's Machinery Industry Engages in Production Cooperation
    Over 40,000 Pieces of Machinery, Electrical Appliances, etc., Produced Through Cooperation
    [This newspaper reported] The Northeast Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee, in coordination with the Northeast Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government and other units, convened a Northeast Machinery Industry Production Cooperation Conference to organize coordination and cooperation among machinery factories in Northeast China to ensure the needs of supporting equipment for key construction projects and equipment modification of existing enterprises. Through this conference, a total of more than 42,000 pieces of machinery, electrical appliances, special tools, etc., were organized for cooperative production.
    To guarantee the needs of key construction projects: for example, the three medium and small block vibrating screens required by Benxi, after research, were divided for production, with the Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery General Factory forging the parts and the Electric Machinery Factory producing them. The hydraulic press required by Factory 375 has been determined to be processed by the High-Voltage Switch Factory and assembled by the Water Pump Factory. Other sporadic equipment and accessories with more complex technology urgently needed by important factories and mines have also been organized for cooperative manufacturing. To ensure that the needs of key construction projects are met, the conference also organized long-term cooperation among relevant machinery factories, determining that for general orders of key projects that local machinery factories can manufacture, several factories should be fixed to be responsible for cooperation; for professional equipment orders that need to be manufactured by specialized factories, the specialized factory should be the main one and other factories should cooperate. In addition, the conference also conducted supervision and inspection based on the needs of key projects. For example, for Anshan Iron and Steel's 1954 orders, the delivery dates of about a dozen factories could not meet the needs of the start of construction. After the conference urged and inspected and assisted in solving problems in material supply and technical cooperation for the manufacturing factories, the orders could be supplied ahead of schedule.
    To guarantee the needs of equipment modification of existing enterprises: for example, the blower with more than 1,500 revolutions per minute required by Benxi could not be manufactured for a long time in the past. After research, it was determined that several factories in Shenyang would cooperate in manufacturing it. One hundred and ten types of steel casting accessories urgently needed by Anshan Iron and Steel, after research, were divided among machinery factories in Shenyang, Fushun, and Fuxin for cooperative production. Large wheels with a diameter of two to four meters needed by mines in various parts of Northeast China could not be manufactured for several years due to the excessive tooth diameter, which affected the production of factories and mines. This time, it was also decided that Benxi and Anshan Iron and Steel would cooperate in manufacturing them. In particular, the production problems of some common and important mechanical accessories and tools were also solved through the organization of cooperation at this conference. For example, thirteen important production units in the Northeast region lacked hobbing cutters with a modulus of ten to twenty-five or more, which prevented some large machine tools from being fully utilized. At this conference, several factories in Fushun and Harbin cooperated to ensure the production of hobbing cutters.
    According to reports at the conference, the understanding of production cooperation among machinery factories has been significantly improved, and many factories have taken the initiative to help other factories solve difficulties. At the same time, local economic management departments have also begun to pay attention to production cooperation. For example, the Fushun Municipal Finance Committee, the Liaoxi Provincial Finance Committee, and the Dalian Municipal Finance Committee have all initially organized production cooperation among the machinery industries in their respective regions. However, the following problems still exist in the current coordination and cooperation of the machinery industry: First, some factories tend to focus more on the "interests" of their own units and do not recognize the important significance of cooperating with key projects, and actively cooperate. Some only care about their own factory's "potential," and go around "picking up work" to complete the "output value plan," but repeatedly pick on the needs of nearby key projects, with a negative attitude; some push away orders for key projects that have slightly difficult technical conditions, and do not actively try to solve them; some "stay away" from key project orders, and have the idea of being afraid of not being able to complete the task and "being burdened," and so on. Second, the development of cooperation work is still uneven. For example, regional cooperation in important cities such as Shenyang and Harbin has not yet been carried out in a planned manner, and cooperation plans have not yet been universally included in the national plan. Third, due to the many shortcomings in the management of equipment orders for newly built enterprises, they are generally "raised late and needed urgently," so that manufacturing factories cannot fully carry out production preparation work, affecting the smooth progress of production cooperation.
    In addition, the conference put forward several suggestions on how to carry out cooperation work in the future: First, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the education of management personnel in basic-level enterprises in the machinery industry, so that they clearly understand that guaranteeing the supply of equipment for key projects and transforming the old equipment of existing enterprises is the glorious task of the machinery industry in realizing national industrialization; it is necessary to make machinery industry personnel fully aware of the complexity and importance of equipment orders for key projects, and that organizing production cooperation around key projects is a concrete measure for the machinery industry to increase varieties and tap potential. It is required to actively solve difficult problems for key projects, and overcome the incorrect idea that key project orders are "troublesome and money-losing." Second, continue to strengthen the planning of cooperation work and provide key projects with sufficient technical equipment in a timely manner. Even individual orders for key projects should be included in the factory's work plan to ensure that the quality and progress of the equipment fully meet the requirements of key projects. Third, in accordance with the principle of combining national planning and the balance of the competent system with regional balance, develop regional cooperation and extensively organize machinery factories in the region to organize cooperative production around local key projects. The provincial and municipal finance committees should conduct special supervision and inspection of the implementation of the tasks accepted by local machinery factories for key project cooperation. Fourth, in order to fully meet the needs of key projects and solve the key parts problems of existing industrial and mining enterprises, the cooperation tasks determined at this conference should be separately included in the plans by the competent authorities.

    东北区机械工业进行生产协作
    协作生产的机械、电器等共达四万多件
    【本报讯】东北行政委员会财政经济委员会协同中央第一机械工业部东北办事处等单位曾召开东北机械工业生产协作会议，组织东北各机械工厂之间的配合协作，以保证重点建设工程配套设备和现有企业设备改装的需要。经过此次会议组织协作生产的机械、电器、特殊工具等共达四万二千余件。
    在保证重点建设工程的需要方面：如本溪所需中小块摇动筛三个，经过研究后，分由鞍钢机械总厂锻造，电工机械厂制作。三七五厂所需水压机，已确定由高压开关厂加工，水泵厂装配。其他重要厂矿所急需的技术较复杂的零星设备与配件，也已组织协作进行制造。为了使重点工程建设的需要得到保证，会议并组织了有关机械工厂的长期协作，确定：凡重点工程的一般订货当地机械工厂能制造者，应固定几个工厂负责协作；凡专业设备订货需专业工厂制造者，应以专业工厂为主组织其他工厂配合。此外，会议并根据重点工程的需要，进行了督促检查。如鞍钢一九五四年的订货，约有十余个工厂交货日期赶不上开工需要，经过会议督促检查并协助解决制造工厂在材料供应、技术协作等方面的问题，使订货可以提前供应。
    在保证现有企业设备改装的需要方面：如本溪所需每分钟一千五百余转的扇风机，过去长期未能制造，经研究确定由沈阳市几个工厂协作制造。鞍钢急需的铸钢配件一百一十一种，经研究分由沈阳、抚顺、阜新三地机械工厂协作生产。东北各地矿山需要的直径二至四公尺的大车轮，因齿径过大几年来一直未能制造，影响厂矿生产，此次也决定由本溪、鞍钢协作制造。特别是一部分有普遍性的重要机械配件及工具的生产问题通过此次会议组织协作也获得解决。如东北区有十三个重要生产单位因缺少模数在十至二十五以上的滚齿刀，使某些大型机床不能充分开动，这次会上，由抚顺、哈尔滨几个工厂协作保证了滚齿刀的生产。
    据会议上反映，各机械厂对生产协作的认识已显著提高，许多工厂都主动帮助别厂解决困难。同时，各地经济管理部门也开始重视生产协作，如抚顺市财委、辽西省财委、旅大市财委都已初步组织了本地区机械工业的生产协作。但在目前机械工业的配合协作中还存在以下几个问题：第一、有的工厂多偏重本单位的“利益”，没有认识配合重点工程的重要意义，主动进行配合。有的只顾本厂“发挥潜力”，为完成“产值计划”，四出“揽活”，而对就近重点工程的需要却再三挑剔，态度消极；有的对重点工程的订货中技术条件稍有困难者，就一推了事，不积极设法解决；有的对重点工程订货“敬而远之”，有害怕完不成任务“受累”的思想等等。第二、协作工作发展得还不平衡，如沈阳、哈尔滨等重要城市的地区协作还未有计划地开展，协作计划还未普遍列入国家计划。第三、由于新建企业设备订货的管理工作尚存在很多缺点，普遍是“提得迟，要得急”，以致制造厂不能充分地进行生产准备工作，影响生产协作顺利进行。
    此外，对今后如何开展协作工作，会议提出了几项建议：第一、要继续加强对机械工业基层企业管理人员的教育，使他们明确认识到保证供应重点工程设备与改造现有企业旧设备，是机械工业实现国家工业化的光荣任务；必须使机械工业人员充分认识重点工程设备订货的复杂性和重要性，和围绕重点工程组织生产协作是机械工业增加品种、发挥潜力的具体措施。要求积极为重点工程解决困难问题，克服认为重点工程订货是“麻烦事、赔钱活”的不正确思想。第二、继续加强协作工作的计划性，及时提供重点工程以充足的技术设备。各机械厂对重点工程订货，即使是单个的也应列入工厂作业计划，以保证设备的质量、进度完全符合重点工程要求。第三、根据国家的计划及主管系统平衡与地区平衡相结合的原则，以开展地区协作，广泛组织本地区机械工厂围绕当地重点工程组织协作生产。省市财委对当地机械工厂接受重点工程协作任务的执行情况，应作专门督促检查。第四、为全面满足重点工程需要，解决现有工矿企业关键的配件问题，应把此次会上所确定的协作任务由各主管部门分别列入计划。
