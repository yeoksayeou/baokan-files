    Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Since January of this year, state-owned commerce and cooperatives have strengthened the management of non-staple foods. At present, the supply of non-staple foods in major cities and industrial and mining areas across the country is good.

    From January to early May this year, state-owned food companies in various regions have greatly increased the supply of live pigs, fresh pork, and fresh eggs to major cities and industrial and mining areas compared to the same period last year. Comparing the supply volume in the first quarter of this year with the volume supplied by the China National Food Export Corporation in the first quarter of last year, live pigs increased by more than five times, fresh pork increased by 82%, and fresh eggs increased by more than three times.

    This year, when the potatoes in the suburbs of Shanghai were still sprouting and the tomato seedlings had just been transplanted from greenhouses to the fields, the cooperatives began supplying potatoes, tomatoes, green peppers, and winter melons transported from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Guangdong to the markets in Shanghai. On average, each Shanghai resident could eat half a catty of vegetables per day. In April, the aquatic product wholesale station of the China National Food Company in Shenyang supplied Shenyang residents with more than sixty kinds of aquatic products such as yellow croaker, carp, and large prawns, an increase of one-third compared to April last year. The wholesale station has now signed supply and marketing contracts for the second quarter with aquatic product companies in Dalian, Qingdao, Yantai, Changli, Jiangqiao, and other fish-producing areas. Currently, it is the peak season for fresh fish production along the coast. Fresh fish from Qingdao, Yantai, and other places are continuously transported to Shenyang in refrigerated trucks. To ensure the freshness and deliciousness of non-staple foods, the Northeast region has newly established eight ice storage warehouses in Jiamusi, Manzhouli, Qiqihar, Jilin, Changchun, Hegang, Jiaohe, and Dalai to store various fresh fish, fresh meat, and green vegetables. Because ice storage warehouses have been established, even residents of Jiamusi, far from the coast, can now eat fresh fish and shrimp from the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, which they rarely ate in the past.

    This year, coinciding with the establishment of the China National Food Company on New Year's Day, regional companies in East China, Central South, North China, Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as provincial and municipal companies and companies in various special districts, were successively established. In March and April, companies at all levels also widely established purchasing stations, transit stations, purchasing groups, and mobile purchasing teams. The establishment of these organizational structures and the active management of the staff in these departments are the main guarantees for the normal supply of non-staple foods in major cities and industrial and mining areas.

    In addition to the active management of state-owned commerce, cooperatives in various regions have also made great efforts. Cooperatives in many areas of North China have added non-staple food supply institutions. Grassroots consumer cooperatives in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, have universally added non-staple food departments or stalls specializing in non-staple foods. Many supply and marketing cooperative distribution offices in Beijing and Tianjin have added vegetable departments and established close ties with the catering units of various government organizations.

    Since non-staple foods mainly come from rural areas, there are great difficulties in purchasing them in the vast countryside. In order to gradually establish the non-staple food purchasing work on a solid foundation, since the beginning of this year, the China National Food Company has launched credit pre-purchase of live pigs from farmers across the country and has planned to supply farmers with pig feed or exchange feed for live pigs. The state-owned food companies and cooperatives in Central South alone have allocated feed for pre-purchasing and exchanging live pigs from farmers that can raise two million pigs.

    Central South and East China are the main egg-producing areas in China. Now is the egg and duck egg production season. The state-owned food companies and cooperatives in the above-mentioned regions have seized the peak season of egg and duck egg production to vigorously purchase and organize supply. The Henan Provincial Company of the China National Food Company and the supply and marketing cooperatives can now collect an average of more than 2.5 million eggs per day. Since April, the number of vehicles transporting fresh eggs northward on the Beijing-Hankou Railway has increased by more than one-fifth compared to April last year.

    Fresh eggs are a seasonal commodity and easily spoil in hot weather. State-owned food companies in East China, Central South, and North China have organized egg processing in Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places on a large scale. The Northeast region has successfully tested the method of storing fresh eggs with soda ash and is preparing to store a large quantity to supply the market with fresh eggs in the second half of the year.

### 国营商业和合作社加强副食品经营  全国大城市和工矿区副食品供应情况良好

    国营商业和合作社加强副食品经营
    全国大城市和工矿区副食品供应情况良好
    【新华社二十一日讯】自今年一月份起，国营商业和合作社加强副食品的经营。目前，全国各大城市和工矿区副食品的供应情况良好。
    自今年一至五月上旬止，全国各地国营食品公司供应大城市和工矿区的活猪、鲜猪肉、鲜鸡蛋比去年同期大大增加；如以今年第一季度的供应量和去年第一季度中国食品出口公司供应的数量比较，活猪增加五倍多，鲜猪肉增加百分之八十二，鲜鸡蛋增加了三倍多。
    今年，当上海市郊的洋山芋还在抽青，番茄秧才从暖房移植到田里的时候，而合作社从内蒙古自治区和广东等地运往上海的洋山芋和番茄、青椒、冬瓜，已开始在市场供应，平均每一个上海人每天能吃到半斤蔬菜。中国食品公司沈阳市公司水产批发站在四月份供应沈阳市居民的黄花鱼、鲤鱼和大对虾等六十多种水产，数量比去年四月份增加三分之一。这个批发站现已和大连、青岛、烟台、昌黎、江桥等鱼产区的水产公司订了第二季度的供销合同。目前在沿海一带，正是鲜鱼盛产季节，青岛和烟台等地的鲜鱼都用冷藏车源源运到沈阳。为了保证副食品的新鲜美味，东北区在佳木斯、满洲里、齐齐哈尔、吉林、长春、鹤岗、蛟河和大赉等地新建立了八座冰盖仓库，储藏各种鲜鱼、鲜肉和青菜。因为建立了冰盖仓库，连远离海岸的佳木斯居民现在也能吃到过去很少吃到的黄海和渤海产的新鲜鱼虾了。
    今年元旦和中国食品公司成立同时，华东、中南、华北、东北、西北、西南各大区和内蒙古自治区的区公司，各省市的省市公司和各专区的公司也相继成立。三、四月间，各级公司又较为普遍的设立了收购站、转运站、收购组和流动收购小组。这些组织机构的设立和这些部门的工作人员的积极经营，是使目前各大城市以及工矿地区副食品供应正常的主要保证。
    除国营商业积极经营外，各地合作社也作了巨大努力。华北区许多地区的合作社增设了副食品供应机构。河北省唐山市各基层消费合作社普遍增设了副食品部或专门经营副食品的货摊。北京、天津两市不少供销合作社分销处增加了蔬菜部，并和各机关伙食单位建立了密切的联系。
    由于副食品主要来自农村，要在广大农村中采购是有很大困难的。为使副食品采购工作逐步建立在巩固的基础上，今年以来，中国食品公司在全国各地向农民展开了信用预购毛猪的工作，并有计划地供应农民喂猪饲料，或以饲料向农民换购毛猪。仅中南各地国营食品公司和合作社拨出向农民预购和换购毛猪的饲料就可饲养毛猪二百万头。
      中南、华东是我国主要蛋产区。现在正值鸡蛋、鸭蛋生产季节，上述地区的国营食品公司和合作社抓住了鸡蛋、鸭蛋生产旺季，大力收购和组织供应。中国食品公司河南省公司和供销合作社现在每天平均可以收进鸡蛋二百五十多万个。从四月份开始，京汉路北运鲜蛋的车辆比去年四月间约增加五分之一以上。
    鲜蛋是一种季节性的商品，天热容易变坏。华东、中南、华北各地的国营食品公司已在上海、青岛、天津等地大量组织蛋厂加工。东北区用泡花硷储存鲜蛋的办法已试验成功，准备大量储存，以便在下半年供应市场鲜蛋。
