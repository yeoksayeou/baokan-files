Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: According to TASS, the Soviet people widely celebrated the ninth anniversary of the victory over Fascist Germany on the 9th. Reports, lectures, and exhibitions were held in towns and villages to introduce the epoch-making victory of the Soviet armed forces and allied forces over Hitler's Germany, as well as the Soviet Union's struggle to strengthen international peace and friendship. On this day, people everywhere met with famous Soviet heroes of the Great Patriotic War in clubs, cultural palaces, and parks. In Moscow, the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge held a lecture in the Central Lecture Hall introducing the heroic city of Sevastopol. People flocked to visit the Central Museum of the Soviet Army. Among the exhibits in the museum are the victory banner raised by Soviet soldiers on the roof of the Reichstag in Berlin on April 30, 1945, as well as photographs, oil paintings, and weapons of heroic Soviet soldiers. An exhibition of war oil paintings depicting the glorious historical pages of the Soviet army's struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland was held in the hall of the Central Soviet Army House. In Leningrad, mass celebrations were held in two Victory Parks on May 9th. These two parks were opened by more than 100,000 people in Leningrad on October 7, 1945, to commemorate the combat achievements of the Soviet people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th: TASS reports: A conference was held in Berlin on the 8th to celebrate the ninth anniversary of liberation from the oppression of Hitler's fascism.

The following attended the conference: Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic; Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber; Hermann Matern, Vice-Chairman of the People's Chamber; Walter Ulbricht, Paul Scholz, Lothar Bolz, Heinrich Rau, Deputy Prime Ministers of the German Democratic Republic; Friedrich Ebert, Mayor of Greater Berlin; and representatives from all walks of life.

Also attending the conference were: F.S. Semyonov, Soviet Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the German Democratic Republic, Ji Pengfei, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic, and representatives of other embassies and legations.

Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: This is the ninth time we are celebrating the day when the people of Europe were liberated from the oppression of Hitler's fascism. We thank the heroic Soviet army and mourn the soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of the German people.

Otto Nuschke pointed out the reactionary nature of the policies pursued by the Western countries and the Adenauer-Bonn government. This policy in fact leads to the revival of German militarism. He emphasized the peaceful nature of Soviet policy. The Soviet Union has provided continuous and multifaceted assistance to the German people's struggle for German unification. Nuschke emphasized that the working people of the German Democratic Republic are at the forefront of this struggle.

Nuschke went on to say: The attempt by aggressive forces to intimidate the people of all countries with atomic or hydrogen bombs and to obstruct the movement of freedom-loving people for peace has been utterly defeated. The strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union, is growing stronger day by day.

After the speech, a concert was held, performed by famous artists of the German Democratic Republic.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th: On May 9th, the Czechoslovak people warmly celebrated the ninth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Czechoslovakia.

On the morning of the 9th, a military parade was held on Letná Square in the capital, Prague. On the reviewing stand were President Zápotocký, Prime Minister Široký, secretaries of the Politburo of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, heads of government departments, model workers in industry and agriculture, outstanding scientists, and cultural workers. Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Filyubin, Chinese Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Czechoslovakia, Li Qingquan, and other diplomatic envoys to Czechoslovakia were invited to attend the ceremony.

At the beginning of the military parade, General Čepička, Minister of National Defense of Czechoslovakia, first reviewed the troops by car. Then, President Zápotocký delivered a speech. Zápotocký pointed out: Without the heroic sacrifices of the glorious Soviet Army in defeating the Hitler fascist bandits, there would be no socialist construction and development in our country today. We should learn from the Soviet Union's example in building socialism, and learn from the Soviet Union's example in building national defense and defending independence and world peace. When he talked about the friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, he said: We believe that we, together with all peace-loving forces in the world, will thwart the war instigators and their conspiracies and defend peace. We actively support all peace actions. We hope that a policy of consultation will replace a policy of threats and interference, and that all international disputes will be resolved peacefully!

After President Zápotocký's speech, various branches of the Czechoslovak Army, Air Force, security forces, and militia marched past the reviewing stand in formation to be reviewed by the party and government leaders. A large group of jet fighters flew in formation over the square.

On the evening of the 9th, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic held a grand celebration reception.

On the afternoon and evening of the same day, working people and artists in Prague held festive gatherings on Wenceslas Square.

The working people in other cities and villages across the country also held various celebration activities.
