According to recent statistics from the Central Geological Department: in 1953, the Central Geological Department and its affiliated regional geological bureaus received 4,127 letters from the public reporting 5,911 mineral locations. These letters came from people of all classes and provinces across the country, including people as old as eighty and children as young as ten, fully demonstrating the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people and their concern for the country's construction. Many people reported minerals tirelessly. Li Mingshan, an 84-year-old man from Xiuyan County, Liaodong Province, reported more than 30 mineral locations and personally led geological personnel to climb mountains for exploration. Li Chengfei, a worker at the 401 Coal Mine in Sichuan Province, reported minerals three times and used his spare time to collect specimens in areas more than 100 li away. Yang Yanji, a resident of Changchun, handed over a mineral area map he had collected for a long time to the Northeast Geological Bureau.

The mineral locations reported by the masses included 1,377 iron ore locations, 661 coal mine locations, 440 copper ore locations, 136 manganese ore locations, and more than 30 other useful minerals such as petroleum, lead, zinc, and mica. Based on the information in the letters and the results of the identification of mineral samples, the Central Geological Department and major regional geological bureaus initially estimated that more than 50 mineral locations were worthy of attention. These materials from the public reporting of minerals provided good clues for exploration work. After preliminary exploration based on a report from the public in Hebei Province, the North China Geological Bureau discovered a noteworthy magnetite deposit. The outcrop on the eastern side alone was more than 1,000 meters long, and the southern mineral body outcrop passed through several villages, with a total length of five to seven kilometers. Last year, an exploration team working in Guizhou Province also determined the scope of exploration based on information and mineral samples reported by the public. Yang Zhao of the Cultural Department of the Yunnan Military Region reported magnetite in a certain area of Yunnan. The Southwest Geological Bureau identified the mineral samples he sent as having not only strong magnetism and high grade, but also good quality, and has sent people to explore it. Wang Zhaochuan of the People's Government of Daguan County, Yunnan, reported hematite in a certain area, which was analyzed by the Southwest Geological Bureau to have a high iron content and to be a high-quality iron ore, and people have also been sent to explore it. Many of this year's exploration areas were also determined based on information from the public reporting of minerals.

In order to strengthen the work of public mineral reporting, the Central Geological Department and major regional geological bureaus have successively established institutions and strengthened publicity work. Since the publicity of the general task of the state's transitional period this spring, the masses in various places have been even more enthusiastic about reporting minerals. In the first quarter of the year, the Ministry of Geology directly received 515 letters reporting minerals, obtaining information on 653 mineral locations. The number of letters reporting minerals received by the Central South Geological Bureau in the first quarter of this year was four times that of the fourth quarter of last year.

    去年群众报矿近六千处为普查提供了线索
    【本报讯】据中央地质部最近统计：一九五三年中央地质部及所属各大区地质局，收到四千一百二十七件群众来信，信中报告了五千九百一十一处矿产地。报矿信来自全国各省各阶层群众，其中有八十多岁的老人，也有十多岁的少年儿童，充分表现了我国人民爱国主义的热情和对祖国建设事业的关怀。许多人在报矿中不辞艰辛。辽东省岫岩县八十四岁的老人李明山报矿三十多处，并亲自带领地质人员上山踏勘，四川省四零一煤矿工人李成非曾三次报矿，并利用工作的闲暇到一百里以外的地区采集标本，长春市市民杨延今把收藏很久的矿区图交给了东北地质局。
    群众报告的矿产地有铁矿一千三百七十七处，煤矿六百六十一处，铜矿四百四十处，锰矿一百三十六处，还有石油、铅、锌、云母等有用矿产三十余种。中央地质部及各大区地质局根据来信资料和对矿样进行鉴定的结果，初步估计值得注意的矿产共五十多处。这些群众报矿的资料，为普查工作提供了很好的线索。华北地质局根据河北省的一份报矿资料进行初步普查后，发现了一个值得注意的磁铁矿床，仅东侧露头就长达千余公尺，南面的矿体露头经过几个村庄，总长达五公里至七公里。去年在贵州省工作的一个普查队也曾根据群众报矿资料和矿样，确定了普查的地区范围。云南军区文化部杨昭报告云南某地有磁铁矿，西南地质局鉴定了他所送来的矿样，不但磁力强，品位高，质量也较好，已派人前去普查。云南大关县人民政府王昭川报告某地的赤铁矿，经西南地质局分析，含铁率很高，是一种优良的铁矿，也已派人去普查。今年的普查地区中，有许多也是根据群众报矿资料来确定的。
    为了加强群众报矿工作，中央地质部及各大区地质局都先后建立了机构，并加强了宣传工作。今春以来，经过国家过渡时期总任务的宣传，各地群众报矿更为踊跃。第一季度地质部直接收到的报矿信就有五百一十五封，获得矿产情报六百五十三处，中南地质局今年第一季度收到的报矿信为去年第四季度的四倍。
