　　At the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party
　　Speech by Comrade Voroshilov, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU
　　Dear Comrades!
　　On behalf of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, I extend warm fraternal greetings to the Congress, and through you, to the Hungarian Working People's Party and all the Hungarian people! (Prolonged applause)
　　The Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party is being held just as the free People's Democratic Hungary is entering its tenth year. Over these years, under the leadership of its Working People's Party, the Hungarian people have made great achievements in building a new and free life, thus fundamentally changing the face of Hungary. The achievements of the Hungarian people are a vivid example of the great vitality of the people's democratic system—the power of the working people led by the working class.
　　Speaking of this, it is worthwhile to look back at Hungary's past. At that time, it was an enslaved, dependent, and backward semi-feudal country. The Hungarian people were under the yoke of foreign invaders for more than four hundred years, who shackled the vitality of the Hungarian nation. For hundreds of years, the freedom-loving Hungarian people have been waging unyielding struggles for their national liberation, for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The land of Hungary was sprinkled with the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of Hungary—the heroes of this sacred liberation struggle. The great Sándor Petőfi wrote with extreme sorrow: "Can a piece of land still be found in Hungary that has not been infiltrated with Hungarian blood?"
　　After the First World War, Hungary formally became an independent and autonomous country. But in reality, it did not free the Hungarian people from foreign enslavement. The Hungarian people continued to wage heroic struggles for national and social liberation. However, the masters of Hungary at that time—the nobles and capitalists—relied on the assistance of foreign interventionists to immerse the Hungarian proletarian revolution of 1919 in blood. Hungary was thus slavishly attached to the imperialist powers, and their interests directly contradicted the interests of the Hungarian people. They tried every possible means to hinder the economic and cultural development of Hungary, attempting to keep Hungary in a backward state forever in order to achieve their plunderous aims.
　　The Hungarian people will never forget the dark years of Horthy's rule, and will never forget the era of bloody fascist dictatorship, when Hungary's landlords and capitalists colluded with foreign imperialism to carry out ruthless exploitation and oppression of the Hungarian people.
　　At that time, Hungary was a country with a large number of unemployed people and vast numbers of impoverished people, and tens of millions of working people lived in hunger and semi-hunger. The Horthy gang, which dragged Hungary into the anti-people Hitler bandit group, violated Hungary's national interests and the will and wishes of the Hungarian people, and dragged Hungary into the criminal war against the Soviet Union, thus plunging Hungary into a national disaster. The heroic Soviet army rescued the Hungarian people from national disaster. (Prolonged applause) In fierce battles, the Soviet armed forces defeated the German fascist troops occupying Hungary, and by April 4, 1945, the Soviet armed forces had completely liberated Hungarian territory from the hands of the Hitler invaders. This day became the birthday of Hungary's true freedom and the beginning of a fundamental change in Hungary's historical destiny. (Applause)
　　Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, pointed out that the war waged by the Soviet people against Hitler's Germany and its accomplices had a just and liberating nature, saying: "We do not and cannot have such war aims as to forcibly impose our will and our system on the Slavic people and other enslaved people of Europe who expect our assistance. Our aim is to assist these people in their liberation struggle against Hitler's tyranny, and then to give them complete freedom to handle their own affairs in their own territory according to their own will. Absolutely no interference in the internal affairs of other peoples!"
　　The fact is also that, as Hungary was liberated from the Hitler occupiers and their lackeys, the Hungarian people, for the first time in many centuries, gained the possibility of deciding the fate of their motherland. Their generations-long desire for national independence, freedom, and a happy life was realized.
　　The Hungarian people eliminated the economic and political rule of the landlords and capitalists, completely got rid of the pressure of foreign capital, and unprecedented prospects for economic and cultural upsurge were presented before them. The glorious Hungarian people are a labor-loving, persevering, and capable people, and they have achieved great successes in the years of people's power.
　　The Hungarian Working People's Party, under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, has united the best forces of the people and is guiding the country in building a new social system and building socialism.
　　The old Hungary, with its system of exploitation and oppression, the terror of unemployment, and the "market for the sale of human beings," the Hungary with "three million beggars" wandering the streets in search of work, is gone forever.
　　In this short historical period, Hungary has changed from a backward agricultural country into a country with developed socialist industry and advanced culture.
　　Now, the People's Democratic Hungary possesses highly developed industry, and therefore has all the necessary prerequisites to further greatly improve the living standards of the working people in the shortest period of time, because: concern for maximizing the satisfaction of the working people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs is the highest principle of the Hungarian Working People's Party and any party that represents the true interests of its people.
　　The Hungarian Working People's Party correctly believes that this task cannot be solved without vigorously improving agriculture.
　　The great Lenin taught us that we must be good at finding a special link in the historical chain of events at every moment, "This link is the one that must be grasped with all our strength in order to grasp the entire chain and steadily prepare for the transition to the next link."
　　Now, such a decisive link in Hungary's economic development is: to improve and comprehensively develop agriculture, to ensure that the residents have enough food, and to ensure that the light industry obtains the necessary raw materials. The solution of this major and complex task is inextricably linked to the interests of all working classes in Hungary. This is a cause for the whole nation.
　　The program formulated by the Hungarian Working People's Party to promote the upsurge of agriculture in the recent years stipulates that it is necessary to further consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives, which are the basis for the development of this sector of the national economy, organizationally and economically, while also paying attention to the needs of individual laboring farmers to increase agricultural production. All of this will further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class.
　　We all understand that the new tasks facing the Hungarian Working People's Party are arduous, but there is no doubt that your party is capable of overcoming all difficulties, because the measures it has formulated are in line with the vital interests of the working class, laboring peasants, and intellectuals, and are supported by them with all their strength.
　　The Hungarian people are not isolated in the struggle to further promote the national economy and culture and to lay the socialist foundation. They have received, and will continue to receive, the fraternal support of the people of all countries building socialism, and the fraternal assistance of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. (Prolonged applause)
　　The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union and the Hungarian people have supported each other more than once in the history of the struggle for freedom and independence.
　　Long ago, the Russians and Hungarians, together with other nations in Eastern Europe, repelled the Mongol invasion.
　　In the early 18th century, when the Hungarians were carrying out the national liberation movement against the colonial oppression of the Habsburg dynasty, many Russian soldiers and officers stood on the side of the uprising Hungarian people and fought.
　　In the glorious days of 1848-1849, when the Hungarian people rose up under the leadership of national heroes Kossuth, Petőfi, Táncsics, and others to fight against domestic and foreign oppressors, all progressive people in Russia warmly congratulated the Hungarian people. Nicholas I, the Russian Tsar, the "European gendarme" who was frightened by the development of this revolutionary movement, helped the Austrian oppressors to suppress the heroic uprising of the Hungarian people. The true representatives of the Russian people, revolutionary democrats such as the famous Russian figures Herzen and Chernyshevsky, expressed the feelings of the progressive forces of Russian society at that time, and they severely condemned the Russian Tsar's government for its shameful action against the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people's liberation struggle also received the sympathy of some soldiers and officers in the Tsar's army. It is known that a group of Russian soldiers and officers led by Captain Gusev refused to participate in the suppression of the Hungarian revolution, and were handed over to the court for trial and sentenced to death.
　　The friendship between the Russian and Hungarian people was especially strongly manifested during the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Soviet people will never forget that thousands of Hungarians fought in the ranks of the Red Army, and many of them sacrificed their lives to defend the world's first Soviet republic. (Applause)
　　The Soviet people were extremely jubilant to learn of the victory of the Hungarian proletarian revolution and the establishment of the Soviet regime in 1919. The great Lenin, on behalf of Soviet Russia, saluted the Hungarian workers, writing:
　　"You are waging the only reasonable, just, and truly revolutionary war, that is, the war of the oppressed against the oppressors, the war of the workers against the exploiters, the war for the victory of socialism. All the loyal members of the working class around the world are on your side."
　　The combined forces of foreign interventionists and Hungarian reactionaries strangled the Hungarian Soviet Republic at that time. But they could not destroy the will of the freedom-loving Hungarian people, who firmly believed that the day would come when they would kick away the domestic and foreign oppressors and become the masters of their own country. That day finally came.
　　From the day of the birth of the new People's Hungary, the friendship between our two peoples entered a new historical stage, with new content. The principles of proletarian internationalism, mutual assistance, and a sincere desire to seek common economic upsurge are the basis of this friendship.
　　After the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union, in accordance with its policy of respecting the rights of all peoples, was the first to establish diplomatic relations with Hungary, and resolutely protected its independence and national autonomy, opposing the interference of the imperialist bloc in Hungary's internal affairs and the imposition of an unjust peace on it.
　　The friendly relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union were consolidated in February 1948 by the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and Hungary, which was based on the principles of respect for national independence and national autonomy and served peace and the security of all peoples. Since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, the fraternal friendship and alliance between our two countries has been further consolidated for six years, and the cooperation between Hungary and the Soviet Union has become closer.
　　The economic ties between our two countries are expanding year by year. It is known that the agreements on economic cooperation and exchange of goods concluded between the Soviet Union and Hungary are based on the principle of mutual benefit, and therefore these agreements are conducive to the economic development of our two countries. The Soviet people attach great importance to the Hungarian industrial products imported into the Soviet Union, such as seagoing vessels, river vessels, locomotives, and many consumer goods. The Soviet Union's supply of machinery and equipment to Hungary for the construction of factories is increasing year by year, and the supply of raw materials for Hungary's ever-developing industry is also increasing.
　　In 1953, the trade volume between Hungary and the Soviet Union had increased fourteen times compared to 1946.
　　The long-term trade agreement on the exchange of goods signed between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Hungary in 1952, as well as the agreement on the supply of complete sets of enterprise equipment and the provision of technical assistance to Hungary from 1952 to 1955, will help to further expand Hungary's economic ties.
　　The development of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries makes it possible, on the basis of mutual coordination of the economic plans of these countries, to utilize natural wealth and material resources more rationally and effectively for the common interests, as well as to utilize the experience and technical achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction, to promote the cause of the People's Democratic countries (including the People's Republic of Hungary) in the victorious construction of a socialist foundation.
　　In the post-war years, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Hungary have also been strengthened in the cultural sphere. In the Soviet Union, great importance is attached to and great familiarity exists with the brilliant creations of Ferenc Liszt, Sándor Petőfi, Mihály Munkácsy, and other great sons of the Hungarian people. Hungarian classical works and works by modern writers are published in large quantities in dozens of national languages of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, Hungarian works of art are widely known and widely popular. (Applause) The creations of the Hungarian genius writers Tamási Áron and Sándor Nagy won the Stalin Prize. (Applause)
　　The Hungarian people, through their construction labor for the benefit of their motherland, are making a valuable contribution to the cause of consolidating the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. Your successes and achievements clearly demonstrate the superiority of the people's democratic system over capitalism, and these successes and achievements make our party, the working people of the Soviet Union, and all true friends of the Hungarian people feel heartfelt joy. This is entirely understandable. The relations between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries are relations of fraternal friendship, mutual respect, trust, and constant mutual assistance. (Prolonged applause) The basis of this relationship is the principle that all countries, large and small, are equal, a principle that is fundamentally different from the capitalist principle of strong countries enslaving weak countries.
　　Every country in the great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism feels a proper pride in the successes and achievements of its fraternal countries, and regards its successes and achievements as its own successes and achievements. This new relationship between countries has never existed in human history, it guarantees that the countries of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism are politically and technically economically independent of the capitalist world, and it is a reliable guarantee for the victorious advance of every fraternal country.
　　The increasingly consolidated friendship of the people of the democratic camp is the strength and inexhaustible source of the invincibility of the democratic camp. The democratic and socialist countries, united in the growing camp of peace, consistently implement the policy of peace proclaimed by Lenin and Stalin, which has been received with the warmest sympathy and support by the people of all countries in the world. The starting point of this policy of peace is that the socialist system and the capitalist system can coexist for a long time, and that normal relations and business contacts can be established between countries.
　　The Soviet Union's proposal on European collective security and the proposal made by the delegation of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference on the cooperation of the Asian people in the cause of defending peace are vivid manifestations of this policy, which has won the trust of all peace-loving people.
　　The imperialist reactionary forces, who are keen on launching a new war, are doing everything possible to obstruct the relaxation of international tension, they are establishing military blocs, continuing to expand their armaments, intensifying the remilitarization of West Germany and Japan, and trying to establish military springboards in West Germany and Japan to prepare for a war against the peace-loving people of Europe and Asia.
　　The aggressive bloc is pursuing a "policy of strength" of violence, suppression, and intimidation in international relations against the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the countries of the peace camp. However, these gentlemen will sooner or later realize that their attempts to intimidate free people are bound to fail and are ridiculous.
　　The US imperialist monopoly capital's attempt to establish world hegemony has aroused the justified indignation of the broad masses of people in every corner of the world. The people of the whole world do not want war. The people's struggle for peace is intensifying and deepening day by day.
　　Recently, international tensions have been somewhat eased. But we should not overestimate the role of these developments. The enemies of peace will not give up, they have not abandoned their goals, they are openly threatening the world with hydrogen bombs, expanding the network of military bases, and increasing the stockpile of weapons of mass destruction of humanity.
　　Therefore, the task of all peace-loving forces is to tirelessly expose the conspiracies of the war-mongers and their criminal plans, to increase their vigilance and strengthen their organization to prevent any military provocations by the enemies of peace.
　　Comrades! The Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party is resolving many major issues in the life of the party and the entire Hungarian people, and is establishing the tasks for the future development of the national economy, the development of agriculture, the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and the improvement of the living standards of the working people. Trade unions, the Labor Youth League, and other mass organizations that are actively carrying out activities under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party occupy an important position in the life of the new Hungary. I would like to talk specifically about the role of Hungarian women. Under the conditions of the people's democratic system, Hungarian women have had every possibility to give full play to their abilities and talents. The women of free Hungary, like their sisters in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, are a great creative and cultural force. The current task is to further enhance the role of Hungarian women in the national economy and socio-political life, to more boldly promote them to leadership positions, and to more widely absorb them to solve the important problems facing the people. (Applause) The achievements of the People's Republic of Hungary in economic and cultural development vividly prove that the Hungarian people are closely united around the Hungarian Working People's Party, and that the people's trust in the party is constantly growing, considering it to be a truly people's party whose policies are in line with the vital interests of the working people. The closer the people are united around the party, the more the party expands and consolidates its ties with the masses, the greater the strength the party and the people will have to carry out a victorious struggle to realize the resolutions of your congress.
　　The more than fifty years of experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the experience of many other fraternal parties teach us that the unity of the party and the people, the unbreakable unity and solidarity of the party's ranks, is the foundation of the party's consolidation and invincibility. The tasks of socialist construction facing the Hungarian Working People's Party at the present stage urgently require party organizations at all levels and every party member to further improve their activeness and combat effectiveness on the basis of steadfastly implementing the various principles of party building and party life formulated by Lenin and developed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under the leadership of the great Stalin. Leninism teaches us that the collective leadership of party organizations at all levels, from the lowest to the highest, is the highest principle of party leadership. Only collective leadership based on the scientific foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory and the extensive development of criticism and self-criticism can guarantee that the party will not stagnate and become complacent, and that it can avoid randomness and one-sidedness in decision-making. Only when criticism and self-criticism are carried out concretely and effectively, only when party members can boldly expose shortcomings regardless of personal feelings and help to overcome these shortcomings, can this criticism achieve its purpose. This will ensure that the party's cadres give full play to their initiative, make the party's ranks more consolidated and united, and enable it to victoriously complete the tasks before it. We are confident that the resolutions of this party congress will further consolidate the ranks of the Hungarian Working People's Party, enhance the combat effectiveness of the party's ranks, and thereby guarantee the realization of the combat program stipulated by this congress: to further improve all sectors of the national economy and culture of the People's Democratic Hungary.
　　We sincerely congratulate your congress for carrying out fruitful work for the happiness of your people! (Stormy applause)
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union entrusted our delegation to convey the following congratulatory message to the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party:
　　"To the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party:
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union extends fraternal greetings to the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party. (Stormy applause, all stand)
　　Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Hungarian people have made great achievements in consolidating the People's Democratic system and are confidently advancing along the road of socialism.
　　We warmly hope that the Hungarian Working People's Party will achieve new successes in the struggle to build a socialist foundation, to improve agriculture and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people.
　　Long live the organizer and leader of the Hungarian working class and all working people—the Hungarian Working People's Party! (Stormy applause, all stand)
　　Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Hungarian and Soviet people!
　　Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" (Prolonged and stormy applause. All stand. The venue resounded with cheers to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to the friendship between the Soviet and Hungarian people. Delegates shouted: "Hurrah! Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!")

### 在匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会上  苏共中央主席团委员伏罗希洛夫同志的讲话

    在匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会上
　　苏共中央主席团委员伏罗希洛夫同志的讲话亲爱的同志们！
    我代表苏联共产党和苏联人民向代表大会，并通过你们向匈牙利劳动人民党及全体匈牙利人民致热烈的兄弟的敬礼！（经久不息的掌声）
    匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会是在自由的人民民主匈牙利建国刚进入第十个年头的时候举行的。这些年来，匈牙利人民在自己劳动人民党的领导下，在建设新的自由生活中取得了巨大的成就，从而根本改变了匈牙利的面貌。匈牙利人民的成就就是人民民主制度——工人阶级所领导的劳动人民群众的政权——具有伟大生命力的鲜明例证。
    谈到这里不妨回顾一下匈牙利的过去。那时它是一个被奴役的、依赖于人的和落后的半封建国家。匈牙利人民处在外国侵略者的奴役下有四百余年，他们束缚了匈牙利民族的生命力。数百年来爱好自由的匈牙利人民一直为自己的民族解放、为自己祖国的自由和独立进行着不屈不挠的斗争。在匈牙利的土地上洒遍了匈牙利的优秀儿女——这一神圣的解放斗争的英雄们的鲜血。伟大的山陀尔·裴多菲极其沉痛地写道：“在匈牙利还能找到一寸土地没有渗透匈牙利人的鲜血吗？”
    第一次世界大战以后，匈牙利形式上是成为一个独立自主的国家了。但是实际上并没有使匈牙利人民摆脱外国的奴役。匈牙利人民继续为民族和社会的解放而进行英勇的斗争。但是，当时匈牙利的主人——贵族和资本家——依靠外国干涉者的援助而使一九一九年匈牙利无产阶级革命浸沉于血泊中。匈牙利就这样奴役性地附属于帝国主义列强了，而它们的利益是直接和匈牙利人民的利益相抵触的。它们千方百计地阻挠匈牙利的经济和文化的发展，企图使匈牙利永远处于落后状态以达到其掠夺的目的。
    匈牙利人民是永远不会忘记霍尔第统治的黑暗岁月，永远不会忘记血腥的法西斯独裁的年代，当时匈牙利的地主和资本家勾结外国帝国主义，对匈牙利人民进行无情的剥削和压迫。
    当时，匈牙利是一个存在有大批失业者和广大贫困人民的国家，千千万万劳动人民过着饥饿和半饥饿的生活。将匈牙利拖入希特勒强盗集团的反人民的霍尔第匪帮违背匈牙利的民族利益，违反匈牙利人民的意志和愿望，把匈牙利卷进反苏的罪恶战争中，因而使匈牙利面临民族灾难。英勇的苏联军队把匈牙利人民自民族灾难中拯救出来。（经久不息的掌声）苏联武装部队在激烈的斗争中击溃了占领匈牙利的德国法西斯军队，到一九四五年四月四日，苏联武装部队把匈牙利领土自希特勒侵略者手中完全解放出来。这一天就成了匈牙利人民真正自由的诞生日，是匈牙利历史命运获得根本转变的开端。　（掌声）
    列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林在指出苏联人民进行的反对希特勒德国及其同谋者的战争具有正义的和解放的性质时，说道：“我们没有而且也不能有这样的战争目的，如像强使那期待我们协助的斯拉夫人民和欧洲其他被奴役的人民，来接受我们的意志和我们的制度。我们的目的是要协助这些人民的解放斗争去反对希特勒的暴政，然后让他们有完全自由在本国领土上按自己意志来处理自己的事务。绝对不干涉他国人民的内政！”
    事实也是这样，由于匈牙利从希特勒占领者和他们的走狗手中获得解放，匈牙利人民许多世纪来第一次获得了决定自己祖国的命运的可能。他们世世代代要求民族独立、自由和过幸福生活的愿望实现了。
    匈牙利人民消灭了地主和资本家的经济和政治统治，完全摆脱了外国资本的压力，他们面前呈现出了空前未有的经济和文化高涨的前景。光荣的匈牙利人民是爱好劳动、坚忍不拔和能干的，他们在人民政权的年代中获得了巨大的成就。
    匈牙利劳动人民党在马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的旗帜下团结了人民中最优秀的力量，引导国家建设新的社会制度，建设社会主义。
    存在着剥削和压迫制度、失业恐怖和“贩卖人口市场”的旧的匈牙利，有着为了找寻工作而流浪街头的“三百万乞丐”的匈牙利，是一去不复返了。
    在这段短短的历史时期中，匈牙利从落后的农业国变为有着发达的社会主义工业和先进的文化的国家。
    现在，人民民主匈牙利拥有高度发展的工业，因而具有一切必要的先决条件在最短期间内进一步大大提高劳动人民的生活水平，这是因为：关怀最大限度地满足劳动人民不断增长的物质和文化需求，是匈牙利劳动人民党以及代表自己人民真正利益的任何政党的最高准则。
    匈牙利劳动人民党正确地认为：不大力提高农业就不能解决这项任务。
    伟大的列宁教导我们说，必须善于在每个时机里找出事件的历史链条上的一个特别环节，“这个环节是为了把握住整个链条并稳稳准备过渡到下一个环节所必须用全力抓住的”。
    现在匈牙利经济发展中的这样的决定性的环节就是：提高和全面地发展农业，以保证居民有足够的粮食，保证轻工业获得必需的原料。这一重大而复杂的任务的解决是和匈牙利各劳动阶层的利益血肉相关的。这是全民的事业。
    匈牙利劳动人民党所制订的在最近几年内使农业高涨的纲领规定：要在组织上和经济上进一步巩固和发展作为国民经济这一部门发展的基础的农业生产合作社，同时注意到，必须关心个体劳动农民的需要，以增加农业生产。所有这一切将更加加强以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟。
    我们大家都理解到：摆在匈牙利劳动人民党面前的新任务是艰巨的，但是毫无疑问，你们的党是能够克服一切困难的，因为它所制订的措施是符合工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子的切身利益，并得到他们的全力支持的。
    匈牙利人民在争取国民经济和文化的进一步高涨、争取奠定社会主义基础的斗争中不是孤立的。他们曾经得到、并将继续得到在建设社会主义的各国人民的兄弟的支持，得到苏联各族人民的兄弟的援助。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联各族人民和匈牙利人民在为自由和独立的斗争史上曾不止一次地互相支持。
    远在很久以前，俄罗斯人和匈牙利人就曾和东欧其他民族一起打退了蒙古人的进攻。
    十八世纪初叶，匈牙利人在进行反抗哈布斯堡王朝的殖民压迫的民族解放运动时，许多俄罗斯士兵和军官都是站在起义的匈牙利人民一边进行战斗的。
    在一八四八—一八四九年的光荣的日子里，匈牙利人民曾在人民英雄科苏特、裴多菲、坦其奇及其他等人的领导下奋起为反对国内外的压迫者而斗争，当时俄罗斯的一切进步人士都曾热烈地祝贺匈牙利人民。由于这一革命运动的发展而吓得要死的
  “欧洲宪兵”俄国沙皇尼古拉一世，曾帮助奥地利压迫者把匈牙利人民的英勇的起义镇压下去。俄罗斯人民的真正代表，像俄罗斯的著名人士赫尔岑、车尔尼雪夫斯基这样一些革命民主派，表达了当时俄罗斯社会进步力量的感情，他们曾痛斥俄国沙皇政府对匈牙利人民所采取的这一可耻的行动。匈牙利人民的解放斗争还曾得到沙皇军队中一部分士兵与军官的同情。大家知道，以古谢夫大尉为首的一群俄国士兵和军官曾拒绝参加镇压匈牙利的革命，并被交与法庭审判而被处死刑。
    俄罗斯与匈牙利人民的友谊在伟大的十月社会主义革命时期尤其强烈地表现了出来。苏联人民永远不会忘记，曾有成千的匈牙利人在红军的队伍中战斗，其中有许多人为保卫世界上第一个苏维埃共和国而献出了生命。（掌声）
    苏联人民曾经极为欢欣鼓舞地获悉了一九一九年匈牙利无产阶级革命的胜利和苏维埃政权的建立。伟大的列宁代表苏维埃俄国向匈牙利工人致敬时写道：
      “你们进行着唯一合理的，正义的和真正革命的战争，即被压迫者反对压迫者的战争，劳动者反对剥削者的战争，争取社会主义胜利的战争。全世界工人阶级中间所有一切忠诚分子都是站在你们方面的。”
    外国干涉者和匈牙利反动派的联合力量扼杀了当时的匈牙利苏维埃共和国。但是他们并不能摧毁爱好自由的匈牙利人民的意志，匈牙利人民坚信，他们一脚踢开国内外的压迫者而成为自己国家的主人的一天总会到来的。这一天也终于到来了。
    从新的人民匈牙利诞生的一天起，我们两国人民之间的友谊就进入了一个新的历史阶段，它具有了新的内容。无产阶级国际主义的原则、互相帮助和求得共同的经济高涨的真诚愿望就是这种友谊的基础。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，苏联本着自己的尊重各国人民权利的政策，第一个和匈牙利建立了外交关系，并坚决地保护它的独立和国家自主，反对帝国主义集团干涉匈牙利的内政和强加给它以不公正的和平。
    匈牙利和苏联之间的友好关系于一九四八年二月用苏匈友好合作互助条约巩固下来了，这一条约依据的基础是尊重国家独立和民族自主的原则并为和平和各国人民的安全服务的。自从签订了友好合作互助条约后，六年来我们两国的兄弟友谊和同盟更加巩固了，匈牙利和苏联的合作更加密切了。
    我们两国之间的经济联系逐年地在扩大，大家知道，苏联和匈牙利缔结的经济合作与换货的协定是从互利的原则出发的，因而这些协定有利于我们两国的经济发展。苏联人很重视输入苏联的匈牙利工业品，如航海船只、内河船只、机车和许多消费品。苏联供给匈牙利用来兴建工厂的机器和设备逐年增加，为不断发展着的匈牙利工业供应的原料也在增加。
    一九五三年匈牙利和苏联的贸易额已增为一九四六年的十四倍。
    一九五二年苏联和匈牙利人民共和国所签订的关于换货的长期贸易协定，以及关于从一九五二年到一九五五年供给匈牙利全套企业装备和给予技术帮助的协定，有助于进一步扩大匈牙利的经济联系。
    苏联和人民民主国家之间经济合作关系的发展，使得有可能在这些国家的经济计划互相配合的基础上，为了共同的利益而更加合理和有效地利用天然财富和物质资源，以及利用苏联的社会主义建设的经验和技术上的成就，来促进人民民主国家（其中包括匈牙利人民共和国）胜利地建设社会主义基础的事业。
    在战后几年中，苏联和匈牙利人民共和国之间的友好关系在文化方面也加强了。在苏联，大家很重视、很熟悉费伦茨·李斯特、山陀尔·裴多菲、米哈伊·蒙卡奇以及匈牙利人民的其他伟大儿子的天才创作。匈牙利的古典著作和现代作家的作品在苏联用苏联几十种民族文字大量出版。在苏联，匈牙利的艺术作品为大家普遍熟悉，广泛流行。（掌声）匈牙利天才作家塔马希·阿泽尔和桑多·纳吉的创作荣获了斯大林奖金。（掌声）
    匈牙利人民以造福祖国的建设劳动，在巩固和平、民主与社会主义阵营的事业中作出宝贵的贡献。你们的成功和成就明显地表现出人民民主制度优越于资本主义，这些成功和成就使我们的党、苏联的劳动人民以及匈牙利人民的一切真正朋友都感到衷心的欢欣。这是完全可以理解的。苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家之间的关系是兄弟友谊、互相尊重、信任和彼此经常互助的关系。（经久不息的掌声）这种关系的基础是大小国家一律平等的原则，这一原则根本不同于强国奴役弱国的资本主义原则。
    伟大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的每一个国家对于兄弟国家的成功和成就都感到正当的骄傲，并把它的成功和成就看作是自己的成功和成就。这种国家之间的新关系是人类历史中从来不曾有过的，它保证着和平、民主和社会主义阵营国家在政治和技术经济上不依靠资本主义世界，它是每一个兄弟国家胜利前进的可靠保障。
    民主阵营各国人民越来越巩固的友谊是民主阵营的力量和不可战胜的无尽源泉。团结在壮大的和平阵营中的各民主和社会主义国家，一贯地执行列宁和斯大林所宣布的和平政策，这一政策受到全世界各国人民最热烈的同情和支持。这个和平政策的出发点是，社会主义制度和资本主义制度能够长期共处，各国之间能够建立正常关系和事务联系。
    苏联关于欧洲集体安全的建议以及中华人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上提出的关于亚洲人民在保卫和平事业中合作的建议，就是已获得所有爱好和平人们的信任的这一政策的鲜明表现。
    热中于发动新战争的帝国主义反动势力千方百计地阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，他们正在建立军事集团，继续扩张军备，加紧使西德和日本重新军国主义化，力图在西德和日本建立军事跳板，以准备反对欧洲和亚洲爱好和平人民的战争。
    侵略集团在国际关系中推行暴力镇压和恫吓的
  “实力政策”，以反对苏联和和平阵营各国的和平政策。然而，这些老爷们迟早会了解到，他们想恫吓自由人们的企图是必然落空和令人可笑的。
    美国帝国主义垄断资本力图建立世界霸权，这激起了世界各个角落的广大群众正当的愤慨。全世界人民不要战争。人民争取和平的斗争正在日益加紧，日益深入。
    最近国际紧张局势已获得某些缓和。但是我们不应过高估计这些进展的作用。和平敌人不会甘心的，他们没有放弃自己的目的，他们明目张胆地以氢弹威胁世界，扩张军事基地网和增加大规模屠杀人类的武器的储备。
    因此，所有爱好和平力量的任务就是要不懈地揭穿战争贩子的阴谋和他们罪恶的计划，提高自己的警惕和加强组织以防止和平敌人的任何军事挑衅。
    同志们！匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会正在解决党和匈牙利全体人民生活中许多重大的问题，正在确立今后发展国民经济、发展农业、巩固工农联盟和提高劳动人民生活水平的任务。工会、劳动青年联盟和其他在匈牙利劳动人民党领导下积极展开活动的群众性组织，在新匈牙利的生活中占有重要的地位。我想特别谈谈匈牙利妇女的作用。在人民民主制度的条件下，匈牙利妇女已有了发挥自己能力和天才的一切可能性。自由匈牙利的妇女，和她们在苏联、中国及各人民民主国家里的姊妹一样，是一支巨大的创造和文化的力量。目前的任务是更加提高匈牙利妇女在国家经济和社会政治生活中的作用，更大胆地推举她们担任领导职务，更广泛地吸收她们来解决人民面临的重要问题。（掌声）匈牙利人民共和国经济和文化发展的成就生动地证明了，匈牙利人民紧密地团结在匈牙利劳动人民党的周围，证明人民对党的信任不断增长，认为它是真正的人民的党，它的政策是符合劳动人民的切身利益的。人民更加紧密地团结在党的周围、扩大和巩固党与群众的联系，会使党和人民有更大的力量来为实现你们代表大会的决议而进行胜利的斗争。
    苏联共产党五十多年的经验以及其他许多兄弟党的经验教导我们：党和人民的一致，党的队伍的牢不可破的统一和团结是党的巩固和不可战胜的基础。匈牙利劳动人民党面临的社会主义建设现阶段的任务，迫切地要求各级党组织和每一个党员在始终不渝地实现列宁所制定的、为苏联共产党在伟大的斯大林领导下所发展的党的建设和党的生活准则的各项原则的基础上，进一步提高积极性和战斗力。列宁主义教导我们，从最低到最高的各级党组织的集体领导是党的领导的最高原则。只有依据马克思列宁主义理论科学基础的集体领导，广泛展开批评和自我批评才能保证党不致于停滞不前和骄傲自满，才能避免在采取决定时的偶然性和片面性。只有具体和有效地进行批评和自我批评，只有在党员能不顾情面地大胆揭露缺点，并帮助克服这些缺点的时候，这种批评才能达到目的。这会保证党的干部发挥主动精神，使党的队伍更加巩固和团结，使它能胜利地完成摆在面前的任务。我们确信，这次党代表大会的决议会更加巩固匈牙利劳动人民党的队伍，提高党的队伍的战斗力，从而保证实现这次代表大会所要规定的战斗纲领：进一步提高人民民主匈牙利国民经济和文化的各个部门。
    我们衷心祝贺你们的代表大会为自己人民的幸福进行有成果的工作！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    苏联共产党中央委员会委托我们代表团向匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会致下列贺词：
  “匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会：
    苏联共产党中央委员会向匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会致兄弟的敬礼。（暴风雨般的掌声，全体起立）
    匈牙利人民在匈牙利劳动人民党领导下，在巩固人民民主制度方面已取得了巨大的成就，并正在满怀信心地沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    我们热烈地希望匈牙利劳动人民党在争取建设社会主义的基础、争取提高农业和巩固工农联盟、争取不断地提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平的斗争中取得新的成就。
    匈牙利工人阶级和全体劳动人民的组织者和领导者——匈牙利劳动人民党万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声，全体起立）
    匈牙利和苏联两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
        苏联共产党中央委员会”（经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声。全体起立。会场响起了向苏联共产党致敬、向苏匈两国人民友谊致敬的欢呼声。代表们高呼：乌拉！苏联共产党万岁！）
