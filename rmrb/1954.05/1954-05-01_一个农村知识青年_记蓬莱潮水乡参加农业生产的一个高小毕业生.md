    Grandmother often stared blankly at the grain and vegetables in her home, muttering things that others couldn't understand; her eyes, narrowed into two slits from smiling, revealed her inner joy. The old woman always felt that everything was like a fairy tale. She had lived for sixty-five years, and both her husband and son were skilled laborers, but the crops they planted had never been as good as those planted by her grandson, Zhilin: cabbages grew to fifteen pounds each, radishes grew to thirteen pounds each, and the harvest of corn and wheat also exceeded people's expectations. And her grandson, Zhang Zhilin, was only a sixteen-year-old child.

    Back in the autumn of 1951, Grandmother and Zhilin's stepmother separated due to incompatibility. From then on, Zhilin lived with his grandmother. Grandmother was a woman who loved to work. From a young age, she had longed for a happy life, but a happy life had never smiled upon her. She had worked hard all her life in the old society and suffered all her life. Now that Zhilin had grown up, she placed her hopes on her grandson. That year, Zhilin graduated from senior elementary school and stayed home to participate in production.

    Their family had farmland and a well garden. When he first started participating in production, Grandmother was afraid that Zhilin was too young and not strong enough, so she told him: just focus on planting the crops well. But Zhilin said: "It's such a waste to leave the well garden idle." Grandmother said: "You don't know anything; how can you plant the well garden!" Zhilin said: "I have a mouth under my nose. If I don't know, I'll ask." So Grandmother agreed to let him plant vegetables in the well garden.

    Easier said than done. Planting crops was not that simple, especially planting vegetables, which involved even more knowledge. Zhilin really didn't understand anything, which made him anxious and pacing around the garden. Zhilin understood that this couldn't be done by blindly blundering. There was only one path in front of him: to learn from the experienced farmers. So he ran to his garden neighbors for help.

    Many of the garden neighbors were veterans who had been planting gardens for thirty or forty years. They loved the young people who were inheriting their work, so they were willing to pass on their experience in planting gardens to the next generation. They taught him as if they were teaching their own sons. The garden neighbors said: to learn production techniques, you must first do two things: the first is "diligence," and the second is "frugality." If you can do these two things, you'll have learned most of it. Can you do it? Zhilin said: "My grandfather and father were both diligent and frugal people; they didn't waste anything. I grew up in a diligent and frugal family, so how could I not do it?" The garden neighbors all smiled happily. They took in this "apprentice." Zhilin began his real field labor.

    From spring to autumn, Zhilin learned and planted, working day and night. In the spring, he learned how to sow; in the summer, he learned how to cultivate; and in the autumn, he learned how to harvest. He got along very well with the garden neighbors and the experienced farmers, and they quickly became close friends. Zhilin studied the techniques very carefully and proactively, often following behind the old farmers who were working, asking questions while learning to do it himself. Then, he would go back to his own land to experiment. The old farmers were very satisfied with this "apprentice." After a year, he had mastered about eighty percent of the general tasks. After the autumn harvest, he summarized his production achievements, and the harvest volume of Zhilin's land reached the level of ordinary land. This gave him great encouragement.

    But for Zhilin, his biggest gain in production labor was that he truly understood the land and loved it. When he was in school, that yellow, hard land felt somewhat desolate to him. At that time, he didn't love the land very much. Today, when his sweat mingled with the moisture of the land, when he sowed tiny seeds into the moist soil, his feelings also flowed into the soil with the seeds. When he was working, sometimes his whole body was covered with mud and manure, his face was covered with yellow soil, his eyes were blinded by the dust in the sky, and soil was breathed into his nostrils along with the air, he didn't feel dirty or smelly; no, he smelled the fragrance of the soil. When he saw the seeds sprout, break through the soil, and the green seedlings cover the ground, he was so excited. At this time, he couldn't leave the farmland for a day, and he had to take a look at the garden early in the morning. He was happy to see that the seedlings were growing well, and in order to make the crops grow vigorously, he watered and trimmed them tirelessly again and again. He didn't realize where this energy came from! In this way, he gradually fell in love with the land, and some of his initial thoughts of being uneasy about agricultural production gradually disappeared. He felt that doing farm work was not a boring and uninteresting thing, but that the process from sowing to harvesting was a dynamic and ever-changing process, full of joyful labor. During the second summer vacation, someone asked him to find work outside. Zhilin refused without hesitation.

    In production, the more focused he was, the more deeply he experienced the endless power hidden in the land. Therefore, he was not satisfied with the production techniques and production achievements he had obtained. He felt that to do well in planting, in addition to "diligence" and "frugality," you should also add "study." He never forgot that he was a member of the Youth League and a graduate of senior elementary school, and he was determined to study new technologies.

    At first, whenever Grandmother saw Zhilin using new methods to tend to the crops, she would say: "It's better to honestly follow the old methods. Let others try the new methods first!" Zhilin respected his grandmother very much and always took a consultative approach to reason with her. Zhilin said: "Grandma! Aren't you happy that I'm producing more grain?" Grandmother said: "I'm just afraid it's not guaranteed and we'll harvest less." Zhilin said: "In the past, we planted crops because we only used 'guaranteed' old methods, which is why we harvested less. Learning new technologies will definitely allow us to produce more grain." Grandmother couldn't argue with her grandson and had to agree to let him use the new farming methods with some doubt. She told him: "If you mess around and harvest less grain, and I go hungry, that's being unfilial!" Zhilin said: "Grandma is right! That's not only being unfilial, but also letting the country down!"

    Zhang Zhilin thus began his work of improving agricultural technology. In 1952, Zhilin planted half a mu of wheat in the garden. The seedlings were very thick, growing lush and green, tall and vigorous. Just before maturity, a gust of wind suddenly knocked the wheat down. To save the wheat, Zhilin came up with a method of tying and supporting it, raising the fallen wheat. But the wheat yield was still reduced. Zhilin took this unexpected blow as a lesson. He thought carefully and discovered that the wheat variety was not good and could not withstand the wind. Last year, when planting wheat, he borrowed books on agricultural knowledge from the library. Based on soil quality, irrigation, and fertilizer conditions, he changed to planting awnless wheat with flat ears and provided good care. He was confident of harvesting 350 jin of wheat from this half mu of land.

    In the process of improving technology, he was good at carefully observing small things. One day, he went to the field to look at the crops and found that the row of crops on the edge of the field and in the furrows were not growing vigorously or uniformly. He thought that it would be difficult to increase production if only the crops in the center of the land grew well. After repeated research, he found that this was because the ground was uneven and the fertilizer was unevenly distributed. Later, he improved his farming techniques so that the crops on the entire field grew uniformly.

    Zhilin accepted new things relatively quickly. In addition to unreservedly adopting new farming methods that had already been successfully tested elsewhere—soaking seeds, selecting seeds, wide ridges and dense planting, using insecticides, etc.—he also regularly conducted various experiments himself. He tested the effectiveness of various fertilizers on cabbage in the vegetable garden. He often paid attention to studying the water requirements of various vegetables. Therefore, his vegetables and crops grew very well every year, and production increased every year. The two mu of corn planted in 1952 yielded 280 jin, while the same land yielded 750 jin in 1953. The big cabbages in 1952 averaged eight jin each, while the 850 big cabbages planted last year averaged ten jin each (calculated after being stored in the cellar). Other crops such as peanuts, garlic, radishes, and green onions also grew very well.

    Zhang Zhilin's participation in agricultural production and his active learning of advanced production technologies have won the praise of the local farmers. In Grandmother's words, "Everyone is 'promoting' him." When walking on Chaoshui Street, mentioning "production expert" and "Little Qiu Lin" is almost universally known to be Zhilin, by adults and children alike. Recently, Zhilin was elected as the deputy leader of the mutual aid team. Zhilin didn't expect this and was very flustered. He thought: in the past, it took three years to become a master in any trade. I haven't been planting crops for three years yet, so how can I lead people? He asked everyone to think carefully again and elect someone else. The team members encouraged him, saying, "We've already thought it over. You lead, and we'll support you. What's there to be afraid of?" Seeing that it was difficult to refuse, Zhilin agreed and assured everyone, "We are all on the socialist road, and I guarantee to do everything in my power." When the news of his election as the leader of the mutual aid team reached Grandmother's ears, she was both happy and worried. She was afraid that her grandson couldn't bear this responsibility, but Zhilin said: "With the instructions of the higher-ups and relying on the masses, we will definitely be able to do it."

    Grandmother constantly listened to Zhilin talk about new principles, and her thinking also made great progress. In the past, when Zhilin came home, Grandmother always asked Zhilin if he was tired? Hungry? Cold? Hot? But now, she asks about the situation of the mutual aid team first. Zhilin also often tells his grandmother about the affairs of the team, and he also tells her how the team members are preparing for and looking forward to the establishment of a cooperative. Once, Zhilin promoted socialism to his grandmother. After listening, Grandmother felt like her heart was blooming and exhorted her grandson, "Just work hard! Sooner rather than later, so that Grandma can also see that good socialist scene!"

    一个农村知识青年
    ——记蓬莱潮水乡参加农业生产的一个高小毕业生
    田牧
    祖母经常望着自己家里的粮食和蔬菜出神，自言自语地说些别人听不明白的话；她那笑成了两道缝的眼睛，显露了她内心的喜悦。这个老人总觉得一切都像神话似的，她已活了六十五岁，丈夫和儿子都是生产能手，但他们种的庄稼却从没有像孙子志琳种的这样好过：白菜一棵长到十五斤，萝卜长到十三斤，玉米、麦子的收成也都出乎人们的意料之外。而她的孙子张志琳才不过是个十六岁的孩子。
    还是在一九五一年秋天，祖母和志琳的继母因感情不合，分了家。从那时起，志琳跟着祖母过活。祖母是个爱好劳动的妇女，从年轻时候起她就盼望着幸福生活，但幸福生活却一直没有和她照过面。她在旧社会里劳动了一辈子，也受了一辈子的苦。如今志琳长大了，她就把希望寄托在孙子身上。这一年志琳从高小毕业就留在家里参加生产了。
    他们家里，有庄稼地，也有井园。才开始参加生产，祖母怕志琳岁数小，力不相当，所以关照他说：只要种好庄稼就行了。但志琳却说：“有井园，闲着，多不合算。”祖母说：“什么都不会，凭着什么种井园！”志琳说：“鼻子下面有个嘴，不会，问嘛。”于是祖母同意他在井园种菜。
    说来容易，做着难。种庄稼本不是那样简单的，特别是种菜，其中的学问更多。志琳可真是什么也不懂，急得他在园里直打圈圈。志琳明白，这个玩意不能靠胡闯。面前摆着的只有一条路：向老农学习。于是他便跑去找园邻们求助。
    好多的园邻们，都是种了三、四十年菜园的老手，他们热爱继承他们事业的青年，因此都愿意把种园地的经验传授给后一代。他们像教儿子一样地教他。园邻们说：要学生产技术，先要作到两件事：第一是“勤”，第二是“俭”，要做到这两件，就算会了大半。你能行吗？志琳说：“我祖父、父亲都是勤俭人，是汤水不漏的人，我是在勤俭的家庭里长大的，怎么做不到。”园邻们都高兴地笑了。他们就这样收下了这个“徒弟”。志琳从此开始了真正的田野劳动。
    从春天到秋天，志琳边学边种，没黑没夜地干。春天学播种，夏天学培植，秋天学收割。他和园邻们、老农们相处得很好，他们很快就成了知心朋友。志琳学习技术很专心，很主动，经常跟着正在做活的老农们身后一面问，一面学着做。然后再回到自己的地里去试验。老农们都非常满意这个“徒弟”。经过一年功夫，一般的粗细活都会了个八成了。秋收后总结生产成绩，志琳种的地，收获量达到了一般土地的水平。这给了他极大的鼓舞。
    但对于志琳来说，他在生产劳动中最大的收获，是他真正认识了土地，并且热爱了它。在学校念书的时候，那黄色的坚硬的土地对于他多少有点荒凉的感觉。那时候，他对土地是并不十分热爱的。今天，当他的汗和土地的水分融和在一起的时候，当他将一粒粒小小的种子播种在潮润的泥土里的时候，他的感情也随着种子注入到了泥土里。干起活来，有时候弄得全身沾满了泥和粪，脸上沾满了黄土，眼睛被漫天风沙迷得睁不开，泥土随着空气被呼吸到鼻孔里，他没有感到脏和臭，不，他倒是闻到了泥土的香味；当他亲眼看见种子发了嫩芽，突破地皮，一直到绿油油的禾苗遮盖了地面时，他的心情是那样兴奋和激动。这时，他一天也不能离开庄稼地，大清早起来非到园里瞅一眼不可。他看见禾苗长得很好，感到高兴，为了让庄稼长得旺盛，他一遍又一遍地不辞劳苦地浇水和修理。他自己也没有意识到那来的这股子劲！就这样，他渐渐地爱上了土地，最初还有的一些不安心农业生产的思想，渐渐地消失了。他感到，干庄稼活不是枯燥无味的事，那从播种到收获的过程，是生动地变化着的、充满着愉快的劳动的过程。第二年暑期，有人约他到外面找工作去。志琳毫不犹豫地就拒绝了。
    在生产中，他越专心，就越深刻地体验到土地潜藏着无穷无尽的力量。因此，他没有满足所获得的生产技术和生产成就，他觉得种地这玩艺，要想闹好，除了“勤俭”二字以外，还应该加上个“钻”字。他时刻没有忘记自己是个青年团员，是个高小毕业生，他下定了决心要钻研新技术。
    开始，祖母一看见志琳用新办法在莳弄庄稼时，就说：“还是老老实实地照原来的法子种好了。新门道，让别人先试验去吧！”志琳很尊敬祖母，总是采取商量的态度，向祖母讲道理。志琳说：“婆！我多打粮食你不欢喜吗？”祖母说：“就怕不保险，少收了。”志琳说：“咱们过去种地就因为光用些‘保险’的老办法，才少收了。学会了新技术管保可以多打粮食。”祖母说不过孙子，也只好半信半疑地同意他采用新耕作法。她叮咛说：“你胡摆弄，少收了粮食，叫我挨了饿，就是不孝顺哪！”志琳说：“婆说的对！那不光是不孝顺，更是对不起国家啊！”
    张志琳就这样开始了农业技术的改进工作。一九五二年，志琳在园地里种了半亩小麦，苗很厚，长得绿油油的，又高又青。快到成熟的时候，忽然来了一阵风，把麦子都刮倒了。为了挽救小麦，志琳想出了绑扶的办法，把刮倒的小麦扶植起来。但小麦还是减产了。志琳把这次意外的打击，作为一个教训，他用心捉摸，发现了麦子的品种不好，不能抗风。去年种麦时，他到图书馆借了有关农业知识的书，根据土质、灌溉、肥料等条件，换种了扁穗半芒小麦，又进行了很好的护理。他有信心在这半亩地里收三百五十斤小麦。
    他在改良技术当中，很善于从细小的事情上去仔细观察。有一天他到地里看庄稼，发现地边地头和墒沟的一行庄稼长得不旺盛，不齐茁。他想，光是地中心的庄稼长得好，也很难增产。他反复研究，发现这是因为地面不平，肥料不匀。后来，他改进了耕作技术，这样，一整片土地上的庄稼就都长得齐茁了。
    志琳接受新事物比较快。他除了毫不保留地采用别处已经试验成功的新耕作方法——浸种、选种，宽垄密植、使用杀虫药剂等外，自己还经常作各种试验。他在菜园里试验了各种肥料对白菜的效能。他经常注意研究各类蔬菜的需要水分量。因此他的菜蔬和庄稼年年长得很好，年年增产。一九五二年种的二亩玉米收了二百八十斤，一九五三年收了七百五十斤。一九五二年的大白菜每棵平均八斤，去年种的八百五十棵大白菜，每棵平均十斤（按下窖后的重量计算），其他如花生、大蒜、萝卜、大葱等样样都长得很好。
    张志琳参加农业生产并积极学习先进生产技术的事迹，博得了当地农民群众的赞扬。用祖母的话来说：“大家都‘发’扬他。”走到潮水街上，一提起“生产能手”和“小米邱林”，几乎大人孩子都晓得这是志琳。最近，志琳被选为互助组副组长。志琳没想到这一着，心很慌，他想：过去行行都是学三年才出徒，我种庄稼还不到三年，怎么能领导人家？他叫大家再着实想想，另选一个。组员们鼓励他说：“早就想好了，你领导，大家撑你的腰，怕什么。”志琳看看不好推辞，就答应下来，他向大家保证说：“咱们都走的社会主义道路，我保证尽自己的一切力量。”被选为互助组长的事传到祖母的耳朵里，祖母又喜欢，又担心，她怕孙子担当不了这份责任，但志琳说：“有上级的指示，再依靠群众，一定能干得了。”
    祖母不断地听志琳讲些新道理，思想也大有进步。过去志琳回家，祖母总是先问志琳累不？饿不？冷不？热不？但现在却先问互助组的情况了。志琳也常把组里的事情告诉祖母，他还告诉她互助组的组员们怎样准备和盼望成立合作社的情形。有一次，志琳向祖母宣传社会主义，祖母听了，心里像开了花，嘱咐孙子说：“你就加劲奔吧！早一天是一天，好叫婆也能看看那社会主义好光景！”
