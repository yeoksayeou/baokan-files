Guangdong Province has begun work on establishing the second batch of agricultural production cooperatives, planned for after the spring plowing and before the summer harvest this year. There are currently 741 agricultural production cooperatives being established throughout the province. Once this batch is established, combined with the first batch of 232 cooperatives established before the spring plowing, the province will have approximately 1,000 agricultural production cooperatives.

The preparatory work for establishing this batch of agricultural production cooperatives is generally carried out in conjunction with the spring plowing. The targets for establishing cooperatives in various regions are selected from mutual aid teams with stronger backbones and better performance, especially year-round mutual aid teams.

Before establishing the agricultural production cooperatives, various regions trained cadres for establishing the cooperatives for seven to ten days. Except for the Hainan District, a total of 1,545 people were trained throughout the province. The training work in various regions has now been completed, and the cadres for establishing the cooperatives have gone to the countryside to carry out propaganda and preparatory work for establishing the cooperatives. At the same time, various counties have also conducted centralized training for activists among the targets for establishing cooperatives, so that they can actively connect and mobilize the masses and play a backbone role in establishing the cooperatives after they return. It is estimated that most cooperatives can complete the "three evaluations" work by the end of May.

The work of establishing cooperatives in various regions pays attention to combining with production. At present, the main focus is on doing a good job in field management, striving for a bumper early rice harvest, and also paying attention to preparing for the summer harvest and planting to prevent the establishment of cooperatives from causing confusion in the summer harvest and planting when production is transitioned.

    广东省建立第二批农业生产合作社
    广东省在今年春耕后夏收前计划建立的第二批农业生产合作社工作已经开始进行。全省目前正在建立的农业生产合作社共有七百四十一个。这一批社办成后，再加上春耕前已办成的第一批二百三十二个社，全省将有一千个左右的农业生产合作社。
    这一批农业生产合作社建社的酝酿工作，一般都结合春耕进行。各地建社的对象，均选择有较强骨干和办得较好的互助组、特别是常年互助组。
    各地在建立农业生产合作社前，都以七天到十天的时间集训了办社的干部，除海南区外，全省共集训了一千五百四十五人。现在各地集训工作均已结束，办社干部都已下乡开展办社的宣传酝酿工作。同时各县对办社对象的积极分子，也都进行了集中训练，使他们回去后在办社中，都能够积极串连发动群众，起骨干作用。估计到五月底为止大部分社都可以结束“三评”工作。
    各地办社工作都注意结合生产进行，目前主要以搞好田间管理工作，争取早稻丰收，同时并注意做好夏收夏种的准备工作，以防止建社转入生产时，造成夏收夏种中的混乱现象。（吴尔祥）
