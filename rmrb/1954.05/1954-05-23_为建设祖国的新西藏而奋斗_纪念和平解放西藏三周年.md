Strive to Build a New Tibet for the Motherland
——Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
Pingcuo Wangjie

Today marks the third anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Looking back at the achievements of the past three years fills us with endless excitement and encouragement.

On May 23, 1951, the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. Since then, the suffering Tibetan people have been forever freed from the shackles and enslavement of imperialist aggressor forces and returned to the big family of equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all ethnic groups of the motherland. This is a great victory for the Tibetan people and a great victory for all the people of China.

The Tibetan ethnic group is one of the hardworking and brave ethnic groups with thousands of years of history in our country. In the process of creation and development of the great motherland, it has also fulfilled its glorious responsibilities. As early as more than 1,300 years ago, during the reign of Songtsen Gampo, the most famous Tibetan king in Tibetan history, Thonmi Sambhota, an outstanding son of the working people, invented the alphabet of thirty letters. Since then, the Tibetan people have absorbed a large amount of excellent culture from inside and outside, created many poems, translated Buddhist scriptures, recorded historical events, and left a rich national cultural heritage. The famous oriental architecture—the magnificent Potala Palace on the Potala Mountain in Lhasa, which is thirteen stories high and resplendent, has a history of hundreds of years and is a creation of high art by the Tibetan working people. However, in recent hundreds of years, the Tibetan people have long been under the bloody rule of national oppression. Politics, economy, and culture have long been in a state of stagnation and decline, and people's lives have become poorer year by year. Especially in the last hundred years, imperialist forces have invaded Tibet, which has deepened the suffering of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people have waged heroic struggles against imperialist aggression. In 1904, when British imperialism invaded Lhasa, from Yadong to Gyantse, especially on the Qumi Xiekang Grassland, thousands of Tibetan warriors shed their blood and created glorious deeds in the struggle. However, the Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang not only did not resist foreign enemies, but intensified their oppression and exploitation of the Tibetan people, and provoked and alienated the relationship between various tribes and groups, and between religious sects and temples within Tibet, in order to maintain their reactionary rule. In the past thirty years, imperialism has taken advantage of the Tibetan people's hatred of the Northern Warlords and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and cultivated and used a few pro-imperialist elements to further invade Tibet. Therefore, before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Tibet was separated from the motherland. The Tibetan people suffered unprecedented disasters, people gradually became poor, bankrupt, and even died in large numbers. Taking Songduo Zong in Bomi area of Qamdo as an example, there were more than 100 households 30 years ago, but now there are only more than 10 households left. During the same period, Chaya originally had 10,000 households, but now there are only 2,800 households left. In other areas of the front and rear Tibet and Dabu and Gongbu, some villages have only one-fifth of the original number of households left, and even many places only have the traces of the remaining walls and fields of that year.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War brought the dawn of happiness to the Tibetan people. Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951. Since then, the Tibetan people will gradually move from a long-term situation of poverty, backwardness, and darkness to a new society of prosperity, progress, and bright happiness. Therefore, the peaceful liberation of Tibet marks the beginning of a new and bright era for the Tibetan people, and marks that the Tibetan people have stood up.

The peaceful liberation of Tibet is a glorious victory of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy. In the past three years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the old face of poverty and backwardness in Tibet has begun to change. First of all, the People's Liberation Army has displayed a high degree of new revolutionary heroism, overcoming the obstacles of thousands of mountains and rivers and the harsh natural conditions of the plateau, and victoriously arrived at the national defense line, protecting the interests and security of the Tibetan people and consolidating the southwest national defense of the motherland, with the assistance and support of the people of the whole country, especially the Tibetan people and the local government of Tibet. For more than a thousand years, the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, who are connected by flesh and blood, and other fraternal ethnic groups in our country have united unprecedentedly. The hatred and estrangement between ethnic groups created by the reactionary ruling class of old China in history are disappearing from people's consciousness in the great era of Mao Zedong and on the basis of new friendship. Despite the enemy's instigation and rumors, facts speak louder than words. In the past three years, the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet have been loyal to the agreement and wholeheartedly served the Tibetan people, which has engraved indelible gratitude and trust in the hearts of the Tibetan people. From Kangding to Qamdo, from Lhasa to Shigatse, the Tibetan people, whether ordinary farmers and herdsmen or upper-class monks and lay officials, unanimously call the People's Liberation Army and staff "New Hans." People can fully understand the fundamental change in ethnic relations from such a plain and simple sentence, and can see the trust and expectations of millions of Tibetan people for the advanced Han people. It can be said with certainty that this brotherly and unbreakable friendship will grow day by day, and no imperialists or ambitious people can destroy it. With the leadership of the Communist Party, the Tibetan people have also united, which is an important factor for the development of the Tibetan people. In the past, imperialism and the domestic reactionary ruling class consistently used the internal contradictions in Tibet to create division in order to achieve their conspiracy to oppress and exploit the Tibetan people. But today, the Tibetan people, especially the upper-class people in Tibet, have increasingly and deeply realized from their own experience that unity is the infinite power to build Tibet and build the motherland, and the more united, the more beneficial it is to their own ethnic group and the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland.

The patriotism of the Tibetan people and the Tibetan people is growing. In the past three years, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the patriotic and anti-imperialist forces of the Tibetan local government and the broad masses of monks and lay people have greatly developed. On the "May Fourth" Youth Day in 1952, young people in Lhasa established the Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, uniting the vast number of Tibetan youth to engage in various patriotic activities. This year, on "May Fourth" Youth Day, this organization of young people in Lhasa formally joined the All-China Youth Federation. Last year, the preparatory committee of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation was established on "March 8" Women's Day. After a year of preparation, it was officially announced at the commemorative meeting of this year's International "March 8" Women's Day. At the same time, in order to further enhance the relationship between the central government and the local government, further understand the greatness and strength of the motherland, and especially to express the love and gratitude of the Tibetan leaders, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and all the people and all the monks and lay officials, to the great leader Chairman Mao, the Tibetan local government sent a delegation led by Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba in the summer of 1952 to pay tribute, and successively sent five batches of visiting groups, industrial and commercial representatives, Buddhist representatives, and youth visiting groups to visit the construction situation in various parts of the motherland. Some of them also participated in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea and attended the World People's Peace Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival hosted by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Through these visits, condolences, and meetings, the representatives realized the greatness and loveliness of the motherland and the rapid progress of the construction cause of the motherland, and received profound internationalist and patriotic education. After returning to Tibet, the visiting group widely communicated the construction situation of the motherland and the development situation of various advanced ethnic autonomous regions, which played a considerable role in promoting and encouraging the active implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the construction of Tibet.

In the past three years, under the policy of the Central People's Government to vigorously train ethnic minority cadres, Tibetan youths have successively come to Beijing to study at the Central Institute for Nationalities. Now there are more than 100 people, and more than 200 students are planned to come this summer. This is a valuable asset for the construction of Tibet, and they will become a new force for the development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture.

The People's Government has successively established People's Banks in Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and other places, which has solved many difficulties in internal and external commercial activities that have been difficult to solve for a long time, and has issued interest-free agricultural, industrial, and pastoral loans. Trade companies have been established in Lhasa, Shigatse, and other places to purchase and sell various local specialties at reasonable prices, especially to purchase a large amount of wool that has been unable to be sold and has been accumulated on the border between India and Tibet for nearly two and a half years. This has not only enabled the funds of more than 200 wool merchants to circulate and begin to become active, but also directly shattered the economic blockade conspiracy of imperialism, and the lives of the vast Tibetan herders have also been improved. In order to prevent and control animal epidemics, a serum manufacturing plant was established in Lhasa, and a training class for animal epidemic prevention personnel was opened, training more than 60 epidemic prevention personnel. More than a dozen animal epidemic prevention institutions established in Lhasa, Shigatse, and other places have treated more than 90,000 sick and injured livestock in 1953 alone. Free people's hospitals or temporary clinics have been successively established in Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and other towns. Telecommunications bureaus have also been established in various places. Since December last year, long-distance calls between Lhasa and Beijing have started. The Compilation and Translation Committee established in Lhasa in January 1952 has begun to compile and translate various Tibetan textbooks, sort out Tibetan historical materials, compile Tibetan-Chinese dictionaries, and publish Tibetan news briefs. Famous Tibetan poets and scholars such as Chazhu Rinpoche, Jiangluo Jin, and Suolang Jibu are all working hard for the Tibetan people there. The establishment of Lhasa Primary School is even more important, as it is a primary school for training ethnic minority cadres. The school uses Tibetan for instruction, and the famous Dalai Lama's scripture teacher Chijiang Rinpoche is the principal of the school. Primary schools have also been successively established in Shigatse, Gyantse, and other places, and now there are nearly 2,000 students in total. Last year, Lhasa also held a community education class with nearly 100 people. In addition, the People's Liberation Army has overcome countless natural obstacles with tenacious labor and combat posture, and has carried out land reclamation and water conservancy projects. In the past three years, nearly 40,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the entire region, and more than 300 varieties of crops have been tried, with good results, spreading production experience among the local people. Last year, an agricultural technical cadre training class was also held in Lhasa to train a group of junior agricultural cadres for Tibet. The People's Liberation Army also built approximately 2,000 kilometers of highways from Ya'an to Songduo Zong in Bomi area of Qamdo and from Lhasa to Taizhao. When building the highway from Lhasa to Taizhao, the Tibetan local government mobilized nearly 10,000 Tibetan laborers and People's Liberation Army soldiers to work together. Now the two ends from east to west and from west to east are about to meet, and the highway from Chengdu to Lhasa will soon be open to traffic. The successful completion of this highway is not only of great significance for consolidating national defense, but also will have a great impact on the overall construction of Tibet and improving people's lives.

On April 29 this year, China and India, on a new basis and based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, concluded the "Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India." This fully demonstrates the motherland's maintenance and care for the interests of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan local government and the Tibetan people wholeheartedly support this agreement signed between the Central People's Government and the Indian government through consultation. Since then, the traces left by British aggression against China in Tibet in the past have been changed due to the deep friendship and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Indian people.

In the past three years, through this series of construction work, the lives of the Tibetan people have been initially improved, and a preliminary and favorable foundation has been laid for the further development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture in the future.

Now the motherland has entered the transition period towards great socialism, and the people of the whole country are fighting for the realization of the general task of the transition period. The realization of the general task is the highest and most long-term interest of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and is the material basis for the gradual transition of all ethnic minorities in our country to socialism. During the transition period, the general task in the field of ethnic issues is: to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups, and jointly build the big family of the motherland; within the unified big family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all ethnic groups in all rights, and to implement ethnic regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, to gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups, and to gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between ethnic groups left over from history, so that backward ethnic groups can join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups and gradually transition to socialist society. This is the bright future for the development of all ethnic groups in our country, and naturally it is also the bright future for the development of the Tibetan people.

We people of all ethnic minorities firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the future is infinitely beautiful and happy. But in order to move towards such a beautiful and happy life, all ethnic groups themselves must fully develop their abilities and wisdom in all aspects, and it is possible only on the basis of democratic reforms in politics, economy, and culture. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Appropriate reforms within each ethnic group are a necessary process for the development and progress of each ethnic group and for gradually joining the ranks of advanced ethnic groups. However, this reform must be suitable for the characteristics of the current development stage of the ethnic group, must be based on the will of the majority of the people of the ethnic group, and must take appropriate steps and rely on the cadres of the ethnic group to carry it out." Facts have proved that the Inner Mongolian people, who were very similar to Tibet, have changed their appearance due to democratic reforms in politics and economy. In 1953, the grain output of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by 25%, and the number of livestock increased by more than double compared with the time of liberation. In 1952 alone, the newly bred livestock was more than 1,151,800. The lives of the Inner Mongolian people have therefore been greatly improved, and industrial construction is now underway. Therefore, for the forward development of the Tibetan people and for the happy life of the Tibetan people, it is very necessary to steadily start various reforms based on the current specific situation.

These principles have been recognized or are beginning to be recognized by patriotic elements and many far-sighted people in Tibet, whose patriotism is growing day by day. Article 11 of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet stipulates: "With regard to the various reforms in Tibet, the Central Government will not force them. The Tibetan local government should carry out reforms automatically, and when the people demand reforms, they should be resolved through consultation with the leading personnel of Tibet." The Tibetan local government has established a reform institution since the winter of 1952, and has initially considered and started some measures to reduce the burden on the people, which is very good and worthy of encouragement, but this good thing must continue to develop forward. Only in this way can Tibet's construction cause be promoted forward with the strong help of the Central People's Government, and people's lives can be gradually improved.

The beacon of the general task of the transition period illuminates the road ahead for the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The tasks of each ethnic region are all components of the general task. Taking Tibet as an example: the implementation of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet is the specific task of the general task in the Tibetan region, and is the greatest interest of the Tibetan people at this stage. Therefore, implementing the agreement and gradually implementing reforms that are beneficial to the Tibetan people and the Tibetan people is the current urgent task of the Tibetan people.

It has been a full three years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The Tibetan local government must, on the existing basis, cooperate with the cause of national industrialization, continue to work hard, and continue to move forward. All the Tibetan people should further unite, and under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and our beloved great leader Chairman Mao of all ethnic groups, and under the united cooperation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, further strengthen ethnic unity, and strive to consolidate national defense, implement the seventeen-article agreement, and build a new Tibet for the motherland.

    为建设祖国的新西藏而奋斗
    ——纪念和平解放西藏三周年
    平错汪阶
    西藏和平解放到今天整三年了。回顾这三年来的成就使我们感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。
    一九五一年五月二十三日，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，从此苦难深重的西藏人民永远摆脱了帝国主义侵略势力的羁绊和奴役，回到祖国各民族平等友爱互助合作的大家庭。这是西藏人民的伟大胜利，也是全中国人民的伟大胜利。
    西藏民族是我国境内具有几千年历史的勤劳、勇敢的民族之一，在伟大祖国的创造与发展的过程中，也尽了自己光荣的责任。早在一千三百多年以前，西藏历史上最著名的藏王松赞干布时代，劳动人民的优秀子弟吞木桑颇扎就发明了三十个字母的拼音字。从那以后西藏藏族人民大量地吸收了内外的优秀文化，创作了许多诗歌，翻译了佛经，记载了史事，留下了丰富的民族文化遗产。有名的东方建筑——拉萨布达山上高达十三层、金碧辉煌的雄伟壮丽的布达拉宫，距现在已经有几百年的历史，就是西藏劳动人民高度艺术的创造。但是近几百年来，西藏民族长期受着民族压迫的血腥统治，政治、经济和文化长期地陷于停滞衰退的境况，人民生活一年比一年贫困。特别是近百年来，帝国主义势力侵入了西藏，更加深了西藏人民的苦痛。西藏人民对帝国主义的侵略曾经进行了英勇的斗争。一九○四年，英帝国主义侵入拉萨时，从亚东到江孜线上，特别是曲米昔康草原上，成千成百的藏族勇士，洒下了自己的鲜血，在斗争中创造了光辉的事迹。但是，清皇政府、北洋军阀和蒋介石匪帮不但不去抵抗外敌，更变本加厉地压迫和剥削藏族人民，挑拨和离间藏族内部各部落与集团之间、各教派寺庙之间的关系，以达维持其反动统治的目的。近三十年来帝国主义更利用了藏族人民对北洋军阀及蒋介石匪帮的仇恨情绪，培植并利用少数亲帝分子对西藏进行了进一步的侵略，因而在西藏和平解放以前，西藏便和祖国形成了分离的状态。西藏人民遭受到空前灾难，人民逐渐贫困、破产乃至大批的死亡。仅以昌都地区波密松多宗来说，三十年前约有一百多户现在仅剩十多户。同一时期，察雅原有一万户，现在仅剩二千八百户。其他前后藏及达布、公布地区有些村庄，仅剩原户数的五分之一，甚至许多地方只剩下当年残墙遗田的痕迹。
    中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，给西藏人民带来了幸福的曙光。西藏于一九五一年获得了和平解放。从此西藏人民由长期贫困、落后与黑暗的境遇，将逐步走向繁荣进步与光明幸福的新社会。因此和平解放西藏是标志着西藏民族一个新的光明时代的开始，标志着西藏民族站起来了。
    和平解放西藏是中国共产党民族政策的光辉胜利。三年来西藏人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，旧的贫困落后面貌已经开始变化着。首先，人民解放军发挥了高度的新的革命英雄主义，克服了千山万水和高原恶劣的自然条件的阻力，在全国人民特别是在藏族人民与西藏地方政府协助和支援下胜利地开到了国防线上，保卫着西藏民族的利益和安全，巩固了祖国的西南国防。一千多年来，血肉相连的汉、藏民族和我国其他各兄弟民族一起空前地团结起来了，旧中国反动统治阶级在历史上造成的民族间的仇恨与隔阂，在伟大的毛泽东时代，在新的友谊基础上，从人们的意识中正在消失。尽管敌人挑拨造谣，但事实胜于雄辩，三年来进藏人民解放军和工作人员执行协议的忠心耿耿、全心全意为藏族人民服务的精神，在藏族人民的心灵中刻下了永难磨灭的感激与信任。从康定到昌都，从拉萨到日喀则，藏族人民不论是普通的农牧民或是上层的僧俗官员，一致把解放军和工作人员称为“新汉人”。人们从这样一个平凡而朴实的语句中，可以完全理解出民族关系的根本转变，可以看出千百万藏族人民对先进的汉族人民的信任与期望。可以肯定地说，这种兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊将与日俱增，任何帝国主义、野心分子绝不可能摧毁它。有了共产党的领导，西藏民族内部也团结起来了，这是西藏民族向前发展的重要因素。过去帝国主义与国内反动统治阶级一贯利用西藏内部矛盾，制造分裂局面，以达其压迫和剥削西藏人民的阴谋。但是今天，西藏人民特别是西藏各上层人士从亲身体验中，日益深刻地感到团结是建设西藏、建设祖国的无穷力量，越是团结越对本民族和祖国各兄弟民族有利。
    西藏民族和西藏人民的爱国主义精神在增长中。三年来在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的领导下，西藏地方政府和广大僧俗人民反帝爱国力量已经有很大的发展。一九五二年“五四”青年节，拉萨市青年成立了爱国青年文化联谊会，团结了广大的藏族青年从事于各种爱国活动。今年“五四”青年节时，这个拉萨市青年的组织并正式加入了全国民主青年联合会。去年“三八”妇女节拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会筹备委员会成立了，经过一年的筹备，今年国际“三八”妇女节的纪念大会上它也正式宣告成立了。同时为了进一步增进中央和地方的关系，进一步认识祖国的伟大和强盛，特别是为了表示西藏领袖达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼以及全体人民全体僧俗官员对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱与感激，西藏地方一九五二年夏派出过以柳霞·土登塔巴为首的致敬团，以后又陆续派出参观团、工商代表、佛教代表、青年参观团等共五批到祖国各地参观建设情形，其中部分人员还参加了中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团和出席了世界人民和平大会和世界民主青年联盟主持的第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。通过这些参观，慰问和会议等活动，代表们认识了祖国的伟大可爱和祖国的建设事业正在突飞猛进，受到了深刻的国际主义与爱国主义的教育。参观团回到西藏以后对祖国建设情况以及各先进的民族自治区的发展情况，曾进行了广泛的传达，对积极实现和平解放西藏办法的协议和建设西藏起了相当的推动和鼓舞作用。
      三年来在中央人民政府大力培养民族干部的方针下，西藏青年陆续来北京入中央民族学院学习的到现在已有一百多人，今年夏季仍拟来二百多学生，这是建设西藏的宝贵资本，他们将成为发展西藏政治、经济、文化的新生的力量。
    人民政府在拉萨、日喀则、江孜等地先后设立了人民银行，解决了长期无法解决的内外商业活动上的许多困难，并发放了无利息的农工牧贷款。在拉萨、日喀则等地成立了贸易公司，以合理价格收购和推销了各种土特产品，特别是收购了近二年半无法出售而积压在印藏边境的大批羊毛。这不仅使二百多家羊毛商业家的资金得以周转，开始活跃起来，而且直接粉碎了帝国主义的经济封锁阴谋，西藏广大的牧民生活也因此得到改善。为了防治兽疫，在拉萨设立了血清制造厂，并开办了兽疫防治人员训练班，培养了六十多名防疫人员。在拉萨、日喀则等地设立的十多个兽疫防治机构，仅一九五三年内，就防治病伤牲畜九万多头。在拉萨、日喀则、江孜等城镇先后设立了免费的人民医院或临时诊疗所。各地还设立了电信局。从去年十二月起拉萨与北京间的长途电话已开始通话。一九五二年一月在拉萨成立的编审委员会，已开始编译各种藏文课本，整理西藏历史资料，编写藏汉大辞典，发行藏文新闻简讯等。西藏著名诗人和学者察珠仁布钦、江洛金、索郎吉布等先生都在那里辛勤地为藏族人民服务。拉萨小学的创办更有着重要意义，它是培养民族干部的初级学校。学校用藏文授课，著名的达赖喇嘛的经师赤江仁布钦是这个学校的校长。日喀则、江孜等地也陆续创办了小学校，现在共有学生近二千人。去年拉萨还办了一所近百人的社教班。此外，人民解放军以顽强的劳动、战斗的姿态克服了无数自然障碍，进行了开荒生产、兴修水利等工作，三年来全区已开垦荒地近四万亩，试种三百多种品种农作物，成绩很好，在当地人民中传播了生产经验。去年还在拉萨办了一个农业技术干部训练班，为西藏培养了一批初级农业干部。人民解放军还修筑了从雅安到昌都地区波密松多宗以及从拉萨到太昭段共约二千公里的公路。修筑拉萨到太昭段的公路时，西藏地方政府动员了近万人的藏族民工和解放军战士一起工作。现在由东到西和由西到东的两头快要碰头了，由成都到拉萨的公路很快便可通车。这条公路的胜利完工，不仅对巩固国防有着重大意义，而对于整个西藏的各项建设、改善人民生活方面将发生极大的作用。
    今年四月二十九日，中印两国在新的基础上基于互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则下，缔结了“关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定”，这件事充分地说明了祖国对西藏人民利益的维护和照顾。西藏地方政府和西藏人民热诚拥护中央人民政府和印度政府间经过协商所签订的这个协议，从此过去英国侵略中国而在西藏遗留下来的痕迹由于中印两国人民的深厚友谊和友好合作已得到改变。
    三年来通过了这一系列的建设工作，西藏人民的生活初步得到改善，并为今后进一步发展西藏的政治、经济、文化打下了初步的有利的基础。
    现在祖国已进入了走向伟大的社会主义的过渡时期，全国人民正为过渡时期的总任务的实现而斗争。总任务的实现是我国各族人民最高和最长远的利益，是我国各少数民族逐步过渡到社会主义的物质基础。在过渡时期中，民族问题方面的总任务是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利方面的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。这是我国各民族发展的光明前途，自然也是西藏民族发展的光明前途。
    我们各少数民族人民坚决相信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，前途是无限美满幸福的。但是要走向这样一个美满幸福的生活，各民族自己必须把各方面的能力与智慧充分发挥出来，必须在政治、经济、文化各方面实行民主改革的基础上才有可能。周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上所作的报告中指出：“各民族内部的适当改革，是各民族发展进步、逐渐跻于先进民族水平所必须经历的过程。但这种改革必须适合其本民族当前发展阶段的特点，必须根据其本民族大多数人民的意志，并采取妥善步骤，依靠其本民族干部去进行。”事实已证明，如原与西藏十分相像的内蒙古人民，由于政治、经济的民主改革，已经改变了面貌。一九五三年内蒙古自治区的粮食产量超过解放前最高年产量百分之二十五，牲畜头数比刚解放时增加了一倍多，仅一九五二年新增殖的牲畜就有一百一十五万一千八百多头。内蒙古人民的生活因而大大提高了，现在已在进行工业建设。因此为了西藏民族的向前发展，为了西藏人民的幸福生活，依据当前具体情况，稳步地着手各项改革是十分必要的。
    这些道理在爱国主义日益增长的西藏爱国分子和许多有远见的人士中已经认识或开始认识。和平解放西藏办法的协议第十一条里规定：“有关西藏的各项改革事宜，中央不加强迫。西藏地方政府应自动进行改革，人民提出改革要求时，得采取与西藏领导人员协商的方法解决之。”西藏地方政府从一九五二年冬起设立了一个改革机构，初步考虑并着手若干减轻人民负担的措施，这是很好的，值得鼓励的，但必须把这种好事继续向前发展。唯有这样，西藏的建设事业才能随着中央人民政府的大力帮助而向前推进，人民生活也才能逐步改善。
    过渡时期总任务的灯塔，照耀着我国各族人民前进的道路。各民族地区的工作任务都是总任务的组成部分。以西藏来说：和平解放西藏办法的协议的贯彻就是总任务在西藏地区的具体任务，是现阶段西藏人民的最大利益。因此贯彻协议，逐步实行有利于西藏民族和西藏人民的改革是西藏人民当前的迫切任务。
    西藏和平解放已整整三年了。西藏地方必须在现有的基础上，配合着国家工业化的事业，继续努力，继续前进。全西藏人民进一步团结起来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和我们各族人民亲爱的伟大领袖毛主席的统一领导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的团结合作下，进一步加强民族团结，为巩固国防、为贯彻执行十七条协议、为建设祖国的新西藏而奋斗。
