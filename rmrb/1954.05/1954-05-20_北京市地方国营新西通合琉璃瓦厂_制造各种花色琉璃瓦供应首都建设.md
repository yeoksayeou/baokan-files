Beijing Municipal State-Owned Xin Xitong He Glazed Tile Factory
Manufactures Various Colored Glazed Tiles to Supply the Capital's Construction

	This year, the Beijing Municipal State-Owned Xin Xitong He Glazed Tile Factory will manufacture more than 700,000 pieces of glazed tiles in various colors and designs to meet the needs of construction projects such as the Soviet Exhibition Center, the Asian Students Sanatorium, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and the Soviet Expert Guest House. These tileware pieces, rich in national characteristics, will adorn the buildings with splendor. Currently, the factory is rushing to produce four carved pillars, each 11 meters high and 1.35 meters in diameter, for the central hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center, as well as more than 4,500 pieces of decorative roof tiles.
	The Xin Xitong He Glazed Tile Factory began manufacturing glazed tiles thirty-eight years ago. In recent years, with the commencement of large-scale capital construction, the factory's production scale has continuously expanded, producing large quantities of glazed tiles to supply the needs of construction projects in the capital and other places. Orders have also come from Xi'an, Qingdao, Ulanhot, and other places. This year, the factory has added eight kilns and a branch factory, expanding production. The number of workers has increased from dozens in the early days of liberation to more than 300. It is estimated that this year's output will increase by more than three times compared to last year, equivalent to seven times the highest annual output before liberation.
	The enthusiasm of the staff is very high. Veteran workers such as Guo Wanlong, Zhao Cai, Li Cunde, Wu Wenliang, and Zhang Qingxiang are enthusiastically passing on their skills in carving, coloring, and firing to young workers. The young workers are also studying diligently. More than 20 female workers who joined the factory in February of this year are now able to work independently. Workers have researched and created many new patterns and are constantly improving production methods to increase output. Workers in the ridge tile group created a method of first using molds to press rough blanks and then carving them into finished products, changing the backward production method of making each piece by hand from blank to finished product for more than a thousand years, increasing production efficiency by more than one time. The seven new patterns of glazed tiles made for the Soviet Expert Guest House were made using this new method. Workers in the kiln group improved the kiln loading method and also replaced the old blank kiln bars with iron kiln bars, shortening the kiln firing cycle from nine days to six days and reducing coal consumption by more than 20%.

    北京市地方国营新西通合琉璃瓦厂
    制造各种花色琉璃瓦供应首都建设
    北京市地方国营新西通合琉璃瓦厂今年将要制造七十万件以上的各种色彩和各种花样的琉璃瓦件，供给苏联展览馆、亚洲学生疗养院、中央民族学院、苏联专家招待所等建筑工程的需要。这些富有民族色彩的瓦器，将把建筑物装饰得金碧辉煌。现在这个厂正在赶制苏联展览馆中央大厅的四个高十一公尺、直径一点三五公尺的雕花大柱和四千五百多件屋檐花砖。
    新西通合琉璃瓦厂在三十八年前开始制造琉璃瓦。近几年来，随着大规模基本建设的开始，这个厂的生产规模不断扩大，大量生产琉璃瓦供给首都和其他地方建筑工程的需要。西安、青岛、乌兰浩特等地也都来定货。今年，这个厂又增加了八个窑和一个分厂，扩大了生产。工人人数已由解放初期的几十人增加到三百多人。预计今年的产量将比去年增加三倍多，等于解放前最高年产量的七倍。
    职工们的生产热情都很高。老工人郭万隆、赵才、李存德、吴文亮、张清祥等，热心地把雕刻、配色、烧制等技艺传授给青年工人。青年工人也都认真学习。今年二月进厂的二十多个女工现在都能够工作了。工人们研究创造了很多新花样，并不断地改进生产方法，提高产量。吻作组工人创造了先用模型压铸粗坯，然后再雕刻成成品的方法，改变了一千多年来从做坯到成品都一个个用手工制造的落后生产方法，生产效率提高了一倍以上。这个厂替苏联专家招待所做的七种新花样的琉璃瓦，就是用新方法做出来的。窑作组工人改进了装窑方法，还将几十年来的旧坯炉条改用了铁炉条，使烧窑周期从九天缩短到六天，煤耗减少了百分之二十多。
