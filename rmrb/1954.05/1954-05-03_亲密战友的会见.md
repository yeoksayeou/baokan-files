    Meeting of Close Comrades-in-Arms
    Jin Feng

    "In the flames, in the smoke, Korea is fighting... Giving all, all of life, love, and youth to the motherland, Korea is fighting!" The song gradually rose in intensity, as the chorus of the Korean National Art Theater Troupe sang the grand chorus "Korea is Fighting!" in the auditorium of the General School of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Honor Military School. Seated in the audience were over a thousand students from the Honor Military School, more than ninety percent of whom had participated in the fighting in Korea. Kim Seung-yong, a member of the chorus, looked at these people wearing the "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medals, military merit medals, and warrior honor medals on their chests, these people who had bled and been wounded for the sake of the fighting in Korea. He felt an overwhelming surge of emotion in his heart, and tears welled up in his eyes. He poured all his emotions into his singing of "Korea is Fighting!" At this moment, those sitting in the audience, Zhang Qingquan, who had participated in the first battle abroad at Yunshan; Liu Guiqing, who led a platoon to be the first to break through the 38th parallel; Wang Jinqi, who tenaciously repelled several enemy attacks in the Seoul blocking battle; Zhao Lucheng and Zhang Xuan, who fought at Flying Tiger Mountain and Shangganling; Song Zhanyou, who pursued and annihilated the enemy in the counterattack south of Kimcheng shortly before the armistice... all these people who had fought on Korean soil were deeply moved. The song evoked all their thoughts and feelings for Korea. They thought of the People's Army comrades-in-arms who had pursued and annihilated the enemy with them, and held their positions together; they thought of the Amani who brought hot boiled water in earthenware jars on snowy nights; they thought of those stretcher bearers who shielded the wounded with their own bodies; they thought of the Korean elementary school students who sang "The East is Red" so crisply... all these familiar faces suddenly appeared in their minds. How familiar and unforgettable this was to them!

    "We can never forget the care and support of the Korean people for us," said Liu Guiqing, a first-class meritorious volunteer soldier, at a forum with the Korean people's representatives, recalling the scene of going abroad to fight in late 1950: "Our troops arrived near Kimhwa, only forty-odd li from the 38th parallel. Our platoon lived in the home of a Korean old woman in her forties. Her husband had gone to the front, and she lived with her two children under the artillery fire. She treated us like her own sons. When she saw that our shoes and socks were torn, she would mend them overnight and put them on the kang early in the morning. She brought boiled water and quilts to our guard posts in the air-raid shelters. One day, four enemy planes came, and all the houses in the village were set on fire. Just as we were rushing back to our residence from the air-raid shelter, this Korean mother was already lying in a pool of blood, her little sister, not yet three years old, lying on her mother's chest, crying. All the comrades in the platoon shed tears. We secretly made up our minds to avenge this mother. After dark, our platoon received the combat mission to break through the 38th parallel." In this battle, the platoon led by Liu Guiqing was the first to break through the 38th parallel, capturing 143 soldiers of the Li pseudo-army and killing or wounding more than 30 enemies. Soon after, he was seriously wounded in the battle of Hengcheng. When he was transferred to the hospital in Pyongyang, he contracted tetanus. "Just when my life was in great danger, the Korean female comrade who was nursing me gave me a blood transfusion and saved me." Liu Guiqing looked at his body and said every word with great emotion: "This life of mine was given to me by the Korean sisters with their own blood. It is a pity that I was too badly injured, and after my body recovered, I could no longer return to the front to strike the enemy." He raised his disabled right hand and could not continue speaking in pain.

      "Dear comrade, thank you," Korean writer Huang Jian comforted him gently, and Republic hero Liu Wanshu held his hands. "We care about your current life," Huang Jian said softly again.

    Liu Guiqing finally regained his composure and continued: "The Party and the motherland care about me. After my body recovered, they sent me here to study. In the past, I had only attended school for two years, and I couldn't even write letters. Now I have improved to the junior high school level and can write letters and simple work reports. Please tell Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean mothers and sisters" As he spoke, his voice rose excitedly again: "Please rest assured, we will soon participate in the construction posts of the motherland and continue to do our part in the socialist cause."

    The students of the Honor Military School, like Liu Guiqing, have put down their guns and picked up their pens, and are advancing to the cultural and scientific fortresses as stubbornly as they fought on the battlefield. All of them have strived for grades of four or higher. Just as Liao Yixun, the student representative, said to the Korean people's representatives at the welcome meeting: "Although the enemy has crippled our bodies, it cannot cripple our iron will and determination. Dear comrades-in-arms, let us work together in different posts, and victory will always belong to us!"

    亲密战友的会见
    劲风
    “在烈火里，在烟雾中，朝鲜在战斗………把全部的、全部的生命爱情和青春献给了祖国，朝鲜在战斗”，歌声渐渐激昂起来，朝鲜国立艺术剧场合唱团在河北省革命荣誉军人学校总校的礼堂上演唱着“朝鲜在战斗！”的大合唱，台下坐着一千多个荣誉军人学校的学员，其中百分之九十以上参加了朝鲜的战斗。合唱团团员金承泳望着这些胸前佩带着抗美援朝纪念章、军功章和战士荣誉勋章的人们，望着这些为着朝鲜的战斗流过血、负过伤的人们，他心头感到一阵压不住的激动，眼泪直涌上来。他把全部感情倾注在他唱的“朝鲜在战斗！”的歌声中。这时，坐在台下的人们，那曾经参加了出国第一仗云山战斗的张庆泉，率领一个班首先突破三八线的刘桂庆，在汉城阻击战中顽强打退敌人几次进攻的王进起，在飞虎山、在上甘岭战斗过的赵履诚、张轩，停战前不久在金城以南反击战中追歼敌人的宋占有……所有这些曾经在朝鲜土地上战斗过的人们都深深被感动了。这歌声唤起了他们对于朝鲜的全部思念和感情，他们想起了和他们一起追歼敌人，坚守阵地的人民军战友，他们想起了在大风雪之夜顶着瓦罐送来热开水的阿妈尼；他们想起了那些用自己身体掩护伤员的担架队员们，他们想起了那些清脆地唱着“东方红”的朝鲜小学生……所有这些亲切的面孔一下子都在他们脑海中浮现出来了。这对他们是何等熟悉而又难忘啊！
    “我们永远不能忘记朝鲜人民对我们的关怀和支援，”在和朝鲜人民代表举行的座谈会上，志愿军一等功臣刘桂庆回忆着一九五○年末出国作战的情景：“我们的队伍到了金化附近，那里离三八线只有四十多里，我们一个班住在一位四十多岁的朝鲜老大娘家里。她的丈夫上前线去了，她带着两个孩子在炮火下生活着，她待我们真像自己的儿子一样，看到我们的鞋子、袜子破了，就连夜把它补好，一早就给我们放在炕头上，她把开水和棉被送到我们值班守卫的防空洞里。一天，来了四架敌机，村里所有的房子都被炸得起火了。我们正从防空洞里赶回我们住所时，这位朝鲜母亲已经躺在血泊里，不满三岁的小妹妹伏在母亲的怀里号哭着。全班的同志都掉了眼泪。暗暗地下了决心，要为这位母亲报仇。天黑以后我们班就接受了突破三八线的战斗任务。”在这次战斗中刘桂庆带领的班首先突破三八线，俘掳了一百四十三名李伪军，杀伤了三十多名敌人。不久以后他在横城作战中负了重伤。转运到平壤医院时又得了破伤风。“就在我生命十分危急的时候，看护我的朝鲜女同志给我输了鲜血，救了我。”刘桂庆看着自己的身体一字一句十分激动地说：“我这生命是朝鲜姊妹用自己的鲜血给了我的，遗憾的是我受伤过重，身体复原以后再也不能回到前方打击敌人了。”他举起伤残的右手，痛苦地说不下去。
      “亲爱的同志，谢谢你，”朝鲜作家黄健温和地抚慰着他，共和国英雄柳万洙握住他的双手。“我们关心着你现在的生活。”黄健又轻轻地说。
    刘桂庆终于恢复了平静，继续说下去：“党和祖国关怀着我，在我身体复原以后就把我送到这里来学习。过去我才上过两年学，连信也不会写。现在已经提高到初中程度，能写信也能写简单的工作报告了。请转告金日成元帅和朝鲜的妈妈们，姊妹们”说着说着，他的声音又兴奋地提高起来：“请他们放心，不久我们就会参加到祖国的建设岗位上去，在社会主义事业中继续尽我们的一分力量”。
    荣誉军人学校的学员都像刘桂庆一样，放下了枪杆拿起了笔杆，像在战场上作战一样，顽强地向文化和科学堡垒进军。他们全体都争取到四分以上的成绩。正如学员代表廖贻训在欢迎大会上向朝鲜人民代表所说的：“敌人虽然伤残了我们的身体，但是伤残不了我们钢铁般的意志和决心。亲爱的战友们，让我们在不同的岗位上共同努力吧，胜利是永远属于我们的！”
