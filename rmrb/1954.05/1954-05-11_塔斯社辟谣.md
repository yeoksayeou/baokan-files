Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 10th: TASS Geneva, May 10th: On May 9th, the French newspaper "Le Monde" published an Associated Press report stating that the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Gomhouria" had published an interview with V.M. Molotov on international issues, supposedly conducted by the newspaper's reporter. The interview, concerning issues such as French policy and the situation in Indochina, was attributed to V.M. Molotov.

    TASS's correspondent in Geneva has reliably learned that V.M. Molotov did not give any interview and has not met with any foreign reporters in Geneva.

    The aforementioned report published by the Egyptian "Al-Gomhouria" is a rumor spread by certain news agencies to deceive public opinion.

    塔斯社辟谣
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社日内瓦十日讯：五月九日，法国报纸“世界报”刊载了美联社的一篇报道，大意是说，埃及报纸“共和国报”刊载了维·米·莫洛托夫就国际问题对该报记者所发表的谈话。该报所刊载的关于法国政策和印度支那形势等问题的谈话，据说是维·米·莫洛托夫发表的。
    塔斯社驻日内瓦记者获得正确的消息：维·米·莫洛托夫并没有发表任何谈话，并且在日内瓦也不曾接见过外国记者。
    上述埃及“共和国报”所刊载的消息是某些通讯社所散布的用来欺骗舆论的谣言。
