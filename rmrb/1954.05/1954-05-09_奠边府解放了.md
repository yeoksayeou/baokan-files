    Dien Bien Phu Liberated

    The Dien Bien Phu campaign has concluded victoriously after arduous fighting by the Vietnamese People's Army. The Vietnamese people have achieved another significant victory in their just war against the imperialist aggressors, demonstrating their strength.

    Dien Bien Phu had originally been liberated by the Vietnamese People's Army long ago. In November of last year, the American interventionists, in order to expand the Indochina War, instigated the French invading army to formulate the so-called "Navarre Plan," driving the French military command to mobilize elite paratrooper units, airdrop them into Dien Bien Phu, and establish modern fortifications, attempting to use Dien Bien Phu as a solid stronghold to disrupt the rear of the Vietnamese People's Army and attack the newly liberated areas in northwestern Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese People's Army, which has grown stronger through eight years of the war of resistance, immediately and firmly surrounded Dien Bien Phu, continuously shrinking the encirclement, and finally annihilated all the aggressor's troops, re-liberating Dien Bien Phu.

    The liberation of Dien Bien Phu once again proves to the world that the risen Vietnamese people cannot be defeated, and the will of the Vietnamese people to strive for national independence and freedom cannot be thwarted. The imperialists' arrogant attempts to continue pursuing colonialism in Asia and suppressing the national liberation movements of Asian countries are destined to meet with shameful failure. The era in which imperialism could run rampant in Asia, bullying and enslaving the peoples of Asian countries, is gone forever.

    Although the people of Indochina are fully confident and assured of achieving victory in their just war against colonialism, they have always yearned to end the war through peaceful negotiation, based on guaranteeing their national rights. The people and democratic governments of Indochina have repeatedly put forward peaceful proposals for ceasefire negotiations. They are continuing their efforts at the Geneva Conference to seek the restoration of peace in Indochina. Upon arriving at Geneva airport, Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stated in his statement: "The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to do everything in its power to help achieve a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. It is convinced that if the participants of the conference make sincere and positive efforts, the issue of restoring peace in Indochina will be resolved satisfactorily, thereby ensuring that peace and security in Asian countries are maintained, international tensions are eased, and world peace is consolidated." Prince Souphanouvong, Prime Minister of the Laotian Resistance Government, and Sơn Ngọc Minh, Chairman of the Khmer Resistance Government, also issued statements on May 5th and May 3rd respectively, requesting that representatives be sent to participate in the Geneva Conference to ensure the effective resolution of ending the war and restoring peace in Laos and Cambodia. The propositions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Laotian Resistance Government, and the Khmer Resistance Government are perfectly reasonable. The people of Indochina are the victims of aggression, they are constantly achieving victories in the national liberation war, they are just, brave, fearless, and invincible; they are not only fighting for their own national liberation, but also for easing international tensions, for peace in Asia and world peace, and for the interests of the people of Asia and the world, and are willing to use negotiation methods to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of guaranteeing national rights. Without a doubt, the sympathy of all peace-loving people around the world is on their side. In the face of the great people of Indochina, how small and despicable do the imperialist aggressors appear!

    The French people have long been disgusted with the "dirty war" in Indochina. Every French person with any insight knows that if this war continues, it will only sacrifice the lives of French men for the benefit of American imperialism, and the people of Indochina can never be conquered. However, the French government dreams of relying on American aid to achieve a lucky victory militarily, and for this purpose, it does not hesitate to sacrifice the national interests of France to American imperialists. The liberation of Dien Bien Phu should be a lesson for the so-called pro-war faction in France. For the French people, now is the time to stop the Indochina War, the time to strive to ensure that French men no longer sacrifice their lives in Indochina for the benefit of American imperialism, and the time to stop selling France's national interests to American imperialism.

    French Prime Minister Laniel, after the liberation of Dien Bien Phu, issued a statement saying that he wanted to "create an atmosphere conducive to rebuilding peace," but at the same time, he uttered many bellicose old clichés and expressed a tone that was clearly begging for help from American imperialism, which is exactly the opposite of a peaceful atmosphere. French Foreign Minister Bidault attributed the delay in the Geneva Conference negotiations on Indochina to the Soviet Union and China, which is ridiculous. The inevitable failure of the French invading army in Indochina was predetermined long ago. If France insists on continuing the war, it will only result in even more disastrous military defeats and a further decline in its international standing. It is time to sincerely sit down and negotiate to restore peace in Indochina.

    In order to continue to disrupt the Geneva Conference, continue to create international tensions, and turn Southeast Asian countries into American colonies, the United States, under the direction of Dulles, is planning the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Security System" or "Southeast Asia Anti-Communist Countries United Front." The people of the world, especially the people of Asian countries, must always be vigilant against this imperialist aggression conspiracy. Crushing the American imperialists' aggression conspiracy and realizing peace in Asia and the world, in this struggle, the liberation of Dien Bien Phu has given the peace-loving people of all countries and the people of Asian countries increased confidence in victory.

### 奠边府解放了

    奠边府解放了
    奠边府战役经越南人民军的艰苦作战已胜利结束了。越南人民在反对帝国主义侵略者的正义战争中，又一次取得了巨大胜利，显示了自己的力量。
    奠边府本来早已为越南人民军所解放。美国干涉者为了扩大印度支那战争，在去年十一月间怂恿法国侵略军制订所谓“纳瓦尔计划”，驱使法军司令部，调动了精锐的伞兵部队，空降奠边府，建立现代化的工事，企图把奠边府作为扰乱越南人民军后方、进攻越南西北新解放区的坚固据点。但是，从八年抗战的锻炼中日益壮大起来的越南人民军，立即牢牢地包围了奠边府，并不断缩小了包围圈，终于全部歼灭侵略者的军队，再度解放了奠边府。
    奠边府的解放，再一次向全世界证明，站起来了的越南人民是不能被战胜的，越南人民争取民族独立与自由的意志是不能被挫败的。帝国主义者继续在亚洲推行殖民主义，镇压亚洲各国民族解放运动的狂妄企图，是注定要遭到可耻的失败的。帝国主义想在亚洲横行霸道，欺负和奴役亚洲各国人民的时代，已经一去不复返了。
    印度支那人民虽然完全有信心有把握取得反殖民主义的正义战争的胜利，但他们一直渴望用和平协商的方式，在保证他们的民族权利的基础上结束战争。印度支那人民和民主政府早就一再提出了谈判停战的和平建议。他们正继续努力在日内瓦会议上谋求恢复印度支那的和平。越南民主共和国首席代表范文同副总理兼代外长，在抵达日内瓦机场时发表的声明中说：“越南民主共和国代表团准备尽一切力量帮助实现印度支那问题的和平解决。它确信如果会议的参加者作诚恳的和积极的努力，那将使恢复印度支那的和平的问题得到圆满的解决，从而保证亚洲国家的和平与安全得以维持，国际紧张局势得到缓和，世界和平得到巩固。”寮国抗战政府总理苏发努冯和高棉抗战政府主席山玉明，也分别在五月五日和五月三日发表声明，并要求派遣代表参加日内瓦会议，以保证有效地解决在寮国和高棉结束战争和恢复和平的问题。越南民主共和国、寮国抗战政府、高棉抗战政府的主张是再合理也没有了。印度支那人民是被侵略者，他们在民族解放战争中不断取得胜利，他们是正义的，勇敢无畏的，不可战胜的；他们不仅为自己的民族解放而奋斗，并且为了缓和国际紧张局势，为了亚洲和平与世界和平，为了亚洲与世界人民的利益，愿意用谈判协商的方法，在保障民族权利的基础上恢复在印度支那的和平。毫无疑义，全世界爱好和平人民的同情，是在他们这一边的。在伟大的印度支那人民的面前，帝国主义侵略者显得何等渺小，何等卑鄙啊！
    法国人民，老早厌恶对印度支那的“肮脏战争”。法国凡是有点见识的人，都知道这个战争如果再打下去，只是为美国帝国主义的利益而牺牲法国男儿的性命，印度支那的人民是决不能征服的。但是法国政府，却在梦想依赖美国的帮助，在军事上取得侥幸的胜利，为此目的，不惜把法国的民族利益断送给美国帝国主义者。奠边府的解放，对于法国所谓主战派应该是一个教训。对于法国人民来说，现在正是使印度支那战争停止的时候，正是努力使法国男儿不再为美国帝国主义的利益在印度支那牺牲性命的时候，正是停止把法国的民族利益继续出卖给美国帝国主义的时候。
    法国总理拉尼埃，在奠边府解放之后，发表声明，说要“建立一种便于重建和平的气氛”，但是同时说了许多剑拔弩张的老套，和发出明明是向美帝国主义乞怜求援的口吻，这是恰恰与和平气氛相反的。法国外交部长皮杜尔，把自己拖延日内瓦会议上关于印度支那的谈判，说成是苏联和中国拖延这个谈判，这是非常可笑的。法国侵略军在印度支那必然失败，是老早注定了的。如果法国硬要再打下去，只会得到军事上失败得更惨，国际地位跌得更低的结果而已。应该真心坐下来谈判，恢复印度支那的和平了。
    为了继续破坏日内瓦会议，继续制造国际紧张局势，为了把东南亚各国变为美国的殖民地，美国正在由杜勒斯策划所谓“东南亚集体安全体系”，或“东南亚反共国家联合阵线”。全世界人民特别是亚洲各国人民，要永远对这种帝国主义侵略阴谋保持警惕。粉碎美国帝国主义的侵略阴谋，实现亚洲和世界的和平，在这个斗争中，奠边府的解放给了世界各国爱好和平人民和亚洲各国人民增加了极大的胜利信心。
