The Korean People's Delegation Visits Various Places

    In Nanjing

    On May 10th, after a rain in Nanjing, the sun shone brightly. In a courtyard in front of a hall, flowers were in bloom. Here, more than seventy family members of volunteers and representatives of the Korean People's Delegation met.

    The vehicles carrying the distinguished guests stopped outside the courtyard. As soon as Chairman Kim Eung-gi and the representatives got out of the cars, Chen Yuzhen, Bian Huiqing, Li Fenghua... these model volunteer family members who personally sent their sons to the Korean front rushed up. They said as if they were seeing their own relatives: "We've been looking forward to seeing you!" They ushered the representatives into the hall and sat down together like a family.

    In a corner of the hall, volunteer family members Wu Ruiqing and Yu Xiuying surrounded Republic Hero Liu Wanzhu, talking intimately. In the center of the hall, army family model old lady Zhu Xiangxian held Republic Hero Chen Shengyuan's hand tightly and said, "Seeing you is like seeing my own child." It turned out that Chen Shengyuan looked similar to her son. Chen Shengyuan said, "Chinese mother, how excited I am! Seeing you is like seeing my own mother." Old lady Zhu really treated him like her own son, putting a fresh pear to Chen Shengyuan's mouth and inviting him to eat it. The old lady said, "My son wrote from Korea: Korean old women treat him like their own son. Is it the same for you here?"

    At this moment, applause like spring thunder suddenly rang out. It turned out that the military family members and Korean friends were becoming more and more affectionate. Some military family members presented two dozen towels they produced to the representatives. Military family member model Li Fenghua presented her ancestral jade coin to the friends. Li Huangshi, a sixty-five-year-old military family member model, suddenly ran to the stage, took off her beloved jade bracelet from her hand, and presented it to Chairman Kim Eung-gi. He was so excited that he took a long time to say: "Comrade Chairman, my heart, my heart..."

    Chen Yuzhen, a military family member model who had been to Korea to express condolences, had received sincere friendship from the Korean people. Now that she saw Korean friends come to our country, she was really reluctant to part. After repeatedly embracing Korean representative Gu Fuli warmly, she held Liu Wanzhu's hand and said, "I wish you more success!"

    In Shanghai

    On May 12th, the Korean Delegation arrived in Shanghai. Here, they conducted seven days of intense consolation, performances, visits, and tours. Wherever they went, there was an atmosphere of close friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

    At the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory, Chairman Kim Eung-gi of the delegation, and others watched the product usage demonstration by industrial labor model Liu Zhongqi. This factory had supported the Korean front with its products, and the workers presented three new products to the delegation as gifts. At the Shanghai State-owned Yimin Food Company No. 1 Factory, Deputy Leader Li Dongying warmly embraced Xu Cuie, a labor model of the factory, because this factory had produced a large number of canned goods to support the Korean front. In order to produce better canned food for the front, Xu Cuie, disregarding the blisters on her hands, took the lead in changing the "cold loading method" to "hot loading." Korean model worker Li Zhongxie put the Kim Il-sung Medal on Xu Cuie's chest. In the Workers' Cultural Palace, there was a forging hammer on display, which was manufactured by Shanghai workers imitating the products of the Jin Cheng Machine Factory in Korea. It attracted the attention of mining model worker Li Zhongxie. He stroked the machine like an old friend and explained the operating methods.

    At the China Welfare Institute Kindergarten, innocent and lively children welcomed the distinguished guests from Korea like a cluster of flowers, waving their little hands and shouting "Hello, Korean aunts!" Jia Zhongqin, the child of Jia Wendao, a meritorious driver who gloriously sacrificed in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, snuggled tightly beside Korean representative Gu Fuli. The children's sincere feelings were deeply moving. In a certain army hospital, Korean Republic Hero Liu Wanzhu met Wan Fulin, the company commander of Huang Jiguang's company. Liu Wanzhu cordially consoled him. Wan Fulin said: I was wounded in the Shangganling battle, and after being wounded, I was carried to the rear by Korean women. They talked cordially for a long time and agreed to communicate with each other in the future.

    Deputy Leader Li Dongying of the delegation was originally the director of the Korean Institute of Hygiene. He and Korean medical doctor Cui Minghe visited the Department of Surgery of Shanghai First Medical College. Huang Jiasi, the vice president of the medical college, once led a medical team to Korea. This meeting was particularly cordial. The medical experts from the two countries exchanged medical experiences intimately.

    In Hangzhou

    On the afternoon of May 19th, amidst music and cheers, the Korean People's Delegation and the three accompanying art troupes were welcomed into Hangzhou.

    The Korean art troupes performed wonderful programs for all sectors of Hangzhou and the families of martyrs and soldiers in consecutive days. Each performance was warmly welcomed. At the repeated requests of the audience, many actors had to perform again. After repeated curtain calls at the end of each performance, the audience gradually left. On the 21st, our famous Yue opera actors Fu Quanxiang and Fan Ruijuan performed the Yue opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" for the distinguished guests. After the performance, amidst warm applause, the delegation and art troupes presented flowers to the actors.

    The representatives also visited Hangzhou General Machine Factory and Hulin Silk Factory, expressing their deep gratitude to the factories for their assistance to the Korean people during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and after the armistice.

    The distinguished guests also toured the scenic spots and historical sites of West Lake. When they arrived at West Lake, it was sunny after the rain, and the lake and mountains were extraordinarily beautiful. The distinguished guests boated on the lake, and melodious songs echoed on the lake. The distinguished guests also visited the Yue Temple, Lingyin Temple, and the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. They praised Hangzhou's beautiful natural scenery and the exquisite architectural art of our ancient working people.

    On the 22nd, amidst the warm applause of the people of all circles in Hangzhou and the song "People of the world are of one heart," the distinguished guests left Hangzhou for Nanchang and other places.

    朝鲜人民访华代表团在各地
    在南京
    五月十日，南京市雨后初晴，在一所大厅前的场地上，鲜花正吐着芳香，在这里，南京市七十多位志愿军家属和朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表们会见了。
    载着贵宾们的车子在场外停了下来，金应基团长和代表们刚刚走下车，陈玉珍、卞惠卿、李凤华……这些亲自送儿子到朝鲜前线去的志愿军家属模范立刻围了上去。他们像见到亲人一样地说：“早就盼望你们了！”他们把代表们簇拥着迎到大厅里，像一家人似地在一起坐了下来。
    在大厅一角，志愿军功臣家属吴瑞卿和俞秀英围住共和国英雄柳万洙在亲热地谈话。在大厅正中，军属模范朱向娴老太太紧握着共和国英雄陈生渊的手说：“见到你就和见到自己的孩子一样。”原来陈生渊和她儿子的模样差不多。陈生渊说：“中国妈妈，我兴奋的怎样说呢！见到你就像见到了自己的妈妈。”朱老太太真像见到自己儿子一样，把一颗鲜梨送到陈生渊嘴边请他吃，老太太说：“我儿子从朝鲜来信说：朝鲜老大娘待他像亲生儿子一样，你来到这里也一样吗？”
    这时，忽然像春雷般的掌声响了起来，原来军属们和朝鲜友人越谈越亲热了。有的军属把自己生产的两打毛巾献给代表，军属模范李凤华把祖传九代的玉钱献给友人，六十五岁的军属模范李黄氏，突然跑到台前，从手上脱下自己心爱的玉镯，献给了金应基团长，他兴奋得好久才说：“团长同志，我的心意，心意……。”
    曾经到朝鲜慰问过的军属模范陈玉珍，身受过朝鲜人民真挚友谊的接待，现在他见到朝鲜友人来到了我们的国土，真是难舍难分。她和朝鲜代表具富力一再热烈拥抱之后，又握住柳万洙的手说：“祝你功上加功！”
      在上海
    五月十二日，朝鲜访华代表团到达上海。在这里，他们进行了七天的紧张的慰问、演出、访问和参观。他们走到那里，那里就洋溢着朝中两国人民的亲密友谊。
    在新中动力机厂，代表团金应基团长等，观看了工业劳动模范刘仲奇的产品用途表演，这个工厂曾经以自己的产品支援了朝鲜前线，工人们并把三件新产品赠送给代表团作为礼物。在上海国营益民食品公司第一厂，李东英副团长热烈地拥抱了该厂劳动模范徐翠娥，因为这个厂曾经为支援朝鲜前线生产了大量的罐头。徐翠娥为了给前线生产更好的罐头，不顾手上烫起了泡，带头把“冷装法”改为“热装”。朝鲜模范劳动者李钟燮把金日成元帅纪念章，给徐翠娥挂在胸前。在工人文化宫里陈列着一部锻钎机，这部机器是上海工人仿照朝鲜金城机器厂的出品制造的。它吸引着矿山模范劳动者李钟燮的注意，他像老朋友似地抚摸着机器，并且讲述着操作方法。
    在中国福利会幼儿园，天真活泼的孩子们像一簇鲜花似地欢迎来自朝鲜的贵宾，他们摇着小手喊着“朝鲜阿姨好！”在抗美援朝战争中光荣牺牲的功臣司机贾文道的孩子贾钟琴，紧紧地偎依在朝鲜代表具富力的身边，孩子们真挚的感情，使人深受感动。在某陆军医院里，朝鲜共和国英雄柳万洙，见到了黄继光连的连长万福林，柳万洙亲切地慰问了他。万福林说：我是在上甘岭作战负伤的，负伤后由朝鲜妇女抬到后方。他们亲切地攀谈了好久，并约好今后互相通信。
    代表团副团长李东英原是朝鲜卫生研究所所长，他和朝鲜医学博士崔明鹤一道参观了上海第一医学院外科学院。医学院副院长黄家驷曾经率领医疗大队到过朝鲜，这次会见，格外亲切，两国的医学家们亲密地交谈了医学上的经验。
      在杭州
    五月十九日下午，在礼乐声和欢呼声中，朝鲜人民访华代表团及随行三个艺术团体被迎进了杭州市。
    朝鲜艺术团体连日给杭州各界及烈军属演出了精采节目，每次演出都受到了热烈的欢迎，不少演员的表演在观众一再要求下，不得不再演一次。每场终了在一再谢幕之后，观众才渐渐离去。二十一日，我国著名越剧演员傅全香和范瑞娟等为贵宾们表演了越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”。演出结束后，在热烈的掌声中代表团和艺术团体给演员们献了鲜花。
    代表们还参观了杭州通用机器厂和虎林丝厂等处，对各厂在抗美援朝运动中及停战后给朝鲜人民的帮助，表示了深深的感谢。
    贵宾们还游览了西湖的名胜古迹。他们到达西湖时，正是雨后初晴，湖光山色，分外秀丽，贵宾们荡舟湖面，婉转的歌声，在湖面上回旋荡漾。贵宾们还参观了岳庙、灵隐寺和钱塘江大铁桥。他们对杭州美丽的自然景色和我国古代劳动人民精美的建筑艺术，赞赏不已。
    二十二日，在杭州各界人民热烈掌声和“全世界人民心一条”的歌声中，贵宾们离开杭州赴南昌等地。
