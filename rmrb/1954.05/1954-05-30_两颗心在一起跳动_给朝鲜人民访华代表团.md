The clear Yalu River flows through China and also through Korea
It has not separated us
The continuous mountain ranges start in China and end in Korea
They connect us tightly
We are water linked to water, mountains linked to mountains
We are hearts linked to hearts
Ah, like an inseparable chain
We share common hatred
And have experienced common disasters
In our chests burns the same flame for liberation
We fought side by side to extinguish the poisonous flames of aggression
We fought together to defend the spring of humanity
In our martyrs' tombs lie the Korean comrades
The blood of Chinese heroes and heroines
Is also spilled on the plains and mountains of Korea
We love to see the white dresses
Saying they are the wings of the dove of peace
Koreans say our clothes are like the clear blue sky of May
The news of the Korean people's victory
Always sends us into狂欢
Our socialist construction
Also encourages the Korean people to move forward
We embrace each other
In this time of meeting
Two hearts are beating together
Even through our chests we seem to hear it
