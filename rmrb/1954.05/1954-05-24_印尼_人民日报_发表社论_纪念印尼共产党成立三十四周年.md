Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 22nd: The 23rd of May is the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party. An editorial in the Indonesian "People's Daily" reviewed the party's glorious path and the role it played in the struggle for national independence. The newspaper emphasized the role the party played in the 1926 revolution, when the working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, dealt a heavy blow to Dutch colonial rule.

The newspaper went on to emphasize the role the party played in the struggle against the Japanese occupiers, in mobilizing the masses to fight for Indonesian independence in 1945, and in mobilizing workers and peasants against imperialist aggression.

The newspaper stressed: "The recently held Fifth Congress of the Communist Party was a major event. The program it formulated not only armed the Communist Party but also armed the entire people. The Communist Party is constantly consolidating its ranks and standing at the forefront of the struggle for democracy, peace, and independence."
