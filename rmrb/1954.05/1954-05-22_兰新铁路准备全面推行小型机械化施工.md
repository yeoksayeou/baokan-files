Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is preparing to comprehensively promote small-scale mechanized construction in order to continue to reduce the heavy physical labor of railway construction workers, enable large-scale machinery to fully play its role, and accelerate project progress. Various small machines are now being manufactured at an accelerated pace. The iron factory serving the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction project has manufactured 200 automatic tipping dump trucks, which will soon be transported to the construction site for use. The first batch of 70 automatic conveyors capable of horizontal or lifting transport is about to be manufactured. An electric cylindrical screen for screening and washing sand and gravel is also under construction. A Soviet-style track laying machine has also been made into a model. More than a dozen other small machines are being researched and designed by a small mechanization research group composed of engineers with rich on-site experience, advanced workers, and labor models.

The employees building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway have used large machines such as bulldozers, graders, and automatic dump trucks in some projects, but lifting and carrying soil still relies on manual operation by most workers. Large machines also cannot fully play their role due to the lack of coordination with other small machines. For example, the tractor train created by technician Zhang Songnian can pull 37 small flatcars at a time, traveling 500 meters in 15 minutes. However, because the soil loading work of the small flatcars is all done manually, the soil loading efficiency is low, so that the tractor has to stop for a long time every time it pulls. After the implementation of small-scale mechanized construction, work such as soil loading can be gradually done using small machines. For example, in bridge engineering, the work of collecting sand and gravel, screening and washing sand and gravel, mixing concrete, transporting and installing piers and abutments, in addition to the application of large machines such as bulldozers and concrete mixers, also requires the use of many combined derricks, electric cylindrical screens and other small machines. Automatic conveyors will also be used in many processes. In particular, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway needs hundreds of thousands of tons of sand, gravel, ballast and rubble this year. After all of them are transported by automatic conveyors and other small machines, manual carrying and other physical labor can be reduced. The use of an automatic conveyor can save dozens of laborers, and the saved labor costs in two months can be used to make another automatic conveyor.

### 兰新铁路准备全面推行小型机械化施工

    兰新铁路准备全面推行小型机械化施工
    【新华社兰州二十一日电】兰新铁路准备全面推行小型机械化施工，以继续减轻筑路工人繁重的体力劳动，并使大型机械得以充分发挥其作用，加速工程进度。现在各种小型机械正在加紧制造，为兰新铁路筑路工程服务的铁工厂已经制造好了两百台自动倾卸斗车，这些倾卸斗车即将运往工地使用。能够作水平或升高运输用的自动输送带，第一批将要制成七十台。正在制造中的还有筛、洗砂石用的电动圆筒筛。苏联式的铺轨机也已制好模型。还有十多种小型机械，正在由富有现场经验的工程师、先进工作者和劳动模范组成的小型机械化研究组研究设计。
    修筑兰新铁路的职工曾在部分工程中使用推土机、铲土机和自动倾卸汽车等大型机器，但是抬土和背土等工作还是靠大部分工人用手工操作。大型机器也因缺乏其他小型机械的配合，不能充分发挥作用。如技术员张松年创造的拖拉机列车，利用拖拉机一次可以牵引三十七个小平车，在十五分钟内走五百公尺。可是因为小平车的装土工作全用人力，装土效率低，以致拖拉机每牵引一次就不得不停下等很长的时间。开展小型机械化施工后，类似装土这样的工作就可以逐步使用小型机械。又如在桥梁工程中，采集砂石，筛、洗砂石，搅拌混凝土，运输和安装桥墩、桥台等工作，除应用推土机、混凝土搅拌机等大型机器外，还要运用很多联合扒杆、电动圆筒筛等小型机械。自动输送带也将要在很多工序中应用，特别是兰新铁路今年施工需用几十万吨的砂石、道碴和片石，全部采用自动输送带等小型机械后，人工背、抬等体力劳动就可以减轻。使用一台自动输送带可以节省几十个劳动力，两个月下来就可拿节省的工费再做一台自动输送带。
