The Great Chinese People's Liberation Army Educated Us
Xu Guangping, Deputy Head of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army

    The National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, along with a portion of the General Delegation and the Second Sub-Delegation, spent over two months carrying out the task of comforting the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang. Under the leadership of the Head of the General Delegation, and with the close coordination and comprehensive assistance of the Xinjiang Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all representatives, literary workers, and staff members of the delegation thoroughly penetrated the various corners of the troops' stationed areas. With a responsible and active approach, they successfully completed their mission. The delegation representatives extensively and deeply conveyed the cordial care and comfort of Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country to the troops, and reported on the general tasks of the state during the transition period and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This greatly educated and inspired the troops, further strengthened their confidence and determination to build Xinjiang and defend the motherland, enhanced their socialist ideological awareness, further strengthened military-civilian relations, deepened the love of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for their creators and protectors of their happy life – the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    Our dearest people—the People's Liberation Army—call us "relatives sent by Chairman Mao," and welcome us everywhere with lanterns, decorations, gongs, and drums. Many units even prepared fruits, fish, meat, and refreshments to entertain us before we arrived in Xinjiang, and whitewashed the houses to make them snow-white and clean. A cook took out his new quilt, which he had made two or three years ago but had been reluctant to use, and wanted to give it to the relatives sent by Chairman Mao; some soldiers filled in the potholes and puddles on the road to ensure the safe passage of our cars. The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in Yili were so excited that they could not sleep at night when they heard that representatives sent by Chairman Mao were coming, and shouted in their dreams: "The representatives are here, hurry up and greet them!" After hearing the news of the delegation, Esisess, a Kazakh soldier, increased his excavation efficiency from eight cubic meters of earth to thirty-two cubic meters. Baiksha A, a model of learning and labor from a cavalry regiment, was so moved when he saw the representatives that tears streamed down his face, and he swore to the people of the motherland on the spot: "We must strengthen the study of the general line and forever defend the frontier of the motherland."

    Here, we should emphatically point out that through this work of comforting the People's Liberation Army, the representatives of the delegation received the most vivid, profound, specific, and practical education in patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism. During the days we lived with the People's Liberation Army, everything we saw, heard, and came into contact with told us a fact, and also a truth: where there is the People's Liberation Army, there is vitality; where there is the People's Liberation Army, miracles will be created. Through this comforting work, we have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's saying: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing."

    We have personally witnessed the glorious achievements of the heroic People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters in defending the national defense and building the frontier. They guard the Pamir Plateau at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters above sea level, fighting against wind, snow, and miasma all year round, vigilantly guarding against imperialists and spies who dare to invade our territory, and loyally defending our beloved motherland; they have used their own hands to build tall buildings on the boundless and desolate Gobi Desert, and turned the wasteland covered with reeds and thatch into large tracts of fertile land with crisscrossing canals cultivated by tractors. On the banks of the Manas River, the Liu Xuefo high-yield group of a certain unit created a record of 1,349 jin of cotton per mu in unit area yield. The heroic People's Liberation Army has assisted the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in establishing many modern factories under extremely difficult conditions, so that the total industrial output value of Xinjiang has increased more than 25 times compared with 1949. As Chairman Baurhan of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government said at the summary meeting of the comforting work: The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang for four years has brought about tremendous changes in the face of Xinjiang.

    Among the vast number of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, a considerable number are heroic sons and daughters of workers and peasants who participated in the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the 25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. From the day they joined the revolution, under the teachings of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, they took on the glorious and great task of striving for the independence and unity of the motherland and the liberation of the people of the whole country, and experienced a long and extremely arduous and glorious struggle. After entering Xinjiang, they took on the tasks of combat team, work team, and production team, continued to carry forward the fine tradition of the people's army of loving the people, exemplarily implemented the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and made great contributions to the cause of defending and building the frontier of the motherland. But they are the most simple and humble people. They attribute all their achievements to the Party, the people, and Chairman Mao. They do not have a sense of complacency because of their achievements. They attribute all their achievements to the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the support of the people of the whole country. This simple, humble, and high-spirited quality of infinite loyalty to the motherland is worthy of our praise and learning.

    During our comforting work in the Yili area, we had a deeper understanding of the major achievements made by the Party's ethnic policy. In the stationed areas of all troops, there is a new atmosphere of unity between the army and the people and unity among the people of all ethnic groups. From their personal experience, the people of all ethnic groups deeply realized that Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army brought them true liberation and are the creators and protectors of their happy life. They sincerely thank and love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and love their own army—the People's Liberation Army. Before we arrived, the people of all ethnic groups in Yining City voluntarily organized to fill in a muddy road more than 800 meters long with more than one foot of sludge. On the day we arrived in Yining City, tens of thousands of people of all ethnic groups welcomed us together with the troops. On the way to the stationed areas of the troops, we often encountered teams of people of all ethnic groups welcoming us with red flags. When the car stopped in various villages and towns for rest, many people always rushed to the car, warmly shaking hands and greeting us. When we went to a certain unit to express our condolences, we met an elderly Uygur woman sitting in a big cart visiting relatives on the road. When she saw the delegation's car coming, she said to her daughter sitting next to her: "Child, get out of the car and salute the representatives sent by Chairman Mao!" This little girl, twelve or thirteen years old, jumped out of the car nimbly and respectfully saluted the representatives in the car with a Young Pioneer's salute. After I finished speaking at a meeting of military families, an 89-year-old woman, Selihan, gave us a letter, asking me to take this letter back to Beijing for Chairman Mao. She said, my biggest hope is to see Chairman Mao. Now that I have seen you—the people sent by Chairman Mao—it is like seeing Chairman Mao. I am really happy and don't know what to say. In the old society, I suffered all kinds of oppression from the landlord class, and my life was unsettled. I gave birth to fifteen children, but only raised two, and the other thirteen died when they were very young because of poverty and hunger. Chairman Mao brought us today's free and happy life. In order to welcome the delegation, the old woman personally planted five trees, one for Chairman Mao, one for the Communist Party, one for the People's Liberation Army, one for the Volunteer Army, and one for the great unity of all ethnic groups. She said that she hoped that these trees would grow tall and big, with lush branches and leaves, evergreen in winter and summer, like the revolutionary cause led by Chairman Mao. At a consolation meeting presided over by the delegation, a soldier with tears in his eyes came over and embraced me warmly. I said: You are Chairman Mao's good soldiers, good sons and daughters of the people of the motherland. You are working hard to defend the frontier of the motherland. Chairman Mao sent us to express our condolences to you. His enthusiasm moved many people. Many vivid facts fully illustrate that the people of all ethnic groups love their leader Chairman Mao, love their own army, the People's Liberation Army, and we are the people sent by Chairman Mao, who are here to express condolences to the Liberation Army loved by all ethnic groups, so we are also welcomed and loved by the people of all ethnic groups.

    When I write this article, I have a feeling of excitement, happiness, and joy from the bottom of my heart. Because I have the opportunity to accept the important entrustment of Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country to come to Xinjiang and meet our dearest people—the People's Liberation Army, and live with them for so long, and see the glorious achievements created by them in the socialist construction cause in the rich frontier of the motherland with their labor and wisdom, this is very valuable, it is happiness, and it is also glory. These glorious achievements have educated every representative, and they are determined to bring all the achievements back to all parts of Guannei, back to the capital Beijing, and bring them to Chairman Mao. I will do my best to use words and language to convey to the people of the whole country, to encourage the people of the whole country to learn from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism in loyally defending the motherland and building the motherland with selfless labor enthusiasm, and to strive to build our great motherland into a strong and infinitely beautiful socialist society!

    伟大的中国人民解放军教育了我们
    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团副总团长　许广平
    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团总团及第二总分团的一部分人员经两个多月的时间，按照总团长的指示，在中国共产党中央委员会新疆分局、新疆省人民政府、中国人民解放军新疆军区的密切配合与全面的帮助下，经过慰问团全体代表、文艺工作者及工作人员深入部队驻地各个角落，认真负责，积极努力，已顺利地完成了慰问人民解放军驻新疆部队的任务。慰问团代表普遍深入地向部队传达了毛主席和全国人民对解放军的亲切关怀和慰问，并作了国家在过渡时期的总任务和抗美援朝斗争的报告，大大地教育和鼓舞了部队，更加坚定了部队建设新疆、保卫祖国的信心和决心，提高了部队社会主义思想觉悟，进一步地密切了军民关系，加强了民族团结，更加深了新疆各族人民对他们幸福生活的创造者和保卫者——共产党、毛主席和中国人民解放军的热爱。
    我们最亲爱的人——人民解放军——把我们称为“毛主席派来的亲人”，到处悬灯结彩，锣鼓喧天地欢迎我们。许多单位还在我们到新疆以前就把招待我们的水果、鱼肉、茶点准备好，把房子粉刷得雪白洁净。有一位炊事员把自己做好两三年舍不得盖的新被子拿出来，要给毛主席派来的亲人用；有些战士填平路上的泥坑和洼地，使我们的汽车安全通过。驻在伊犁的人民解放军战士们，听说毛主席派来的代表要来，夜里兴奋得不能安眠，在梦中也喊：“代表来了，快去迎接”。哈萨克族战士艾斯色斯听到慰问团来的消息后，挖渠效率由八土方提高到三十二土方。骑兵某团学习和劳动模范白克沙阿见了代表激动得掉下热泪来，当场向祖国人民宣誓说：“一定加强总路线的学习，永远保卫祖国边疆。”
    在这里我们应该着重地提出：通过这次对解放军的慰问工作，使慰问团的代表们受到了一次最生动、最深刻、最具体、最实际的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的教育。在和解放军一起生活的时日里，我们亲眼看到的，听到的，接触到的一切，都告诉了我们一个事实，也是一个真理，那就是：那里有了人民解放军，那里就充满了生命的活力，那里有了人民解放军，那里就会创造出奇迹来。通过这次慰问工作，使我们对毛主席所说的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”这句话体会得更深刻了。
    我们亲眼看到了英雄的人民解放军指挥员、战斗员们在保卫国防和建设边疆的事业中得到的辉煌成就。他们守卫在拔海五千公尺以上的帕米尔高原上，终年与风雪和瘴气搏斗，警惕地防备着胆敢来侵犯我们的国土的帝国主义者及间谍分子，忠诚地捍卫着我们可爱的祖国；他们用自己的双手在一望无际的、荒凉的戈壁滩上，盖起了高大楼房，并使长满着芦苇和芨芨草的荒滩，变成了水渠纵横、用拖拉机耕作的大片良田。在玛纳斯河畔，某部刘学佛丰产组并创造了棉花单位面积产量每亩一千三百四十九斤的纪录。英雄的人民解放军协助新疆各族人民，在极困难的条件下，建立了许多现代化的工厂，使新疆的工业生产总值较一九四九年增加了二十五倍以上。正如新疆省人民政府鲍尔汉主席在慰问工作总结会上所说的：人民解放军进驻新疆四年来使新疆的面貌发生了极大的变化。
    在驻新疆的人民解放军广大指挥员、战斗员中，有相当一部分人是参加过第二次国内革命战争、二万五千里长征、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争的百战百胜的英雄的工农子弟兵。他们从参加革命的那天起，就在毛主席和朱总司令的教导下，把争取祖国的独立统一和解放全国人民的光荣而伟大的任务担负起来，经历了漫长的极其艰苦、极其光辉的斗争道路。在进驻新疆后，他们又肩负起战斗队、工作队、生产队的任务，继续发扬了人民军队爱护人民的优良传统，模范地执行了党和人民政府的政策，在保卫和建设祖国边疆的事业中，贡献出了巨大的力量。但他们是最质朴、最谦逊的人，他们把一切功绩都归功于党、人民和毛主席，他们没有因为自己的成绩产生居功自满的情绪，他们把一切成绩都归功于党和毛主席的正确领导，归于全国人民的支援。这种质朴、谦逊和对祖国无限忠诚的高尚品质，是值得我们歌颂和学习的。
    我们这次在伊犁区的慰问工作中，对党的民族政策所取得的重大成绩，有了较深刻的体会。在各部队驻地，到处都呈现着军民团结，各族人民团结的新气象。各族人民从切身经历中，深刻体会到毛主席和人民解放军给他们带来了真正的解放，是他们幸福生活的创造者和保卫者，他们衷心地感激和热爱共产党和毛主席，热爱自己的军队——人民解放军。伊宁市各族人民在我们未到之前，自动组织起来，把八百多公尺长的一条淤满着一尺多深的泥浆路填平。我们到达伊宁市的那天，成千上万的各族人民，都和部队一起欢迎我们。我们到各部队驻地的路上，常常碰到整队打着红旗欢迎我们的各族人民，汽车在各村镇停下来休息时，总有很多群众涌到汽车的周围，热情地和我们握手问好。我们到某部进行慰问时，路上碰到一个坐着大车走亲戚的维吾尔族老大娘，她看到慰问团的汽车过来，向坐在她旁边的女儿说：“孩子，快下车给毛主席派来的代表敬礼！”这个十二三岁的小姑娘敏捷地跳下车来，恭敬地向车里的代表们行了一个少先队员的举手礼。我在一次军属座谈会上讲完话以后，一个八十九岁的老大娘色力汗交给我们一封信，要我把这封信带回北京给毛主席。她说，我最大的希望，就是想看看毛主席，现在见了您们——毛主席派来的人，就和见到了毛主席一样，我真高兴得不知说什么好。在旧社会里，我受尽了地主阶级的压迫，生活没着落，我生了十五个孩子，只养育大了两个，那十三个都因为贫困和饥饿在很小的时候就死了。毛主席给我们带来了今天自由和幸福的生活。这个老大娘为了迎接慰问团，还亲自种了五棵树，一棵为毛主席，一棵为共产党，一棵为解放军，一棵为志愿军，一棵为各族人民的大团结。她说愿这些树长得高高的，大大的，枝叶繁茂，冬夏长青，像毛主席领导的革命事业一样。在一次由慰问团主持的慰问会上，一个战士眼里含着激动的泪，走来热情地和我拥抱，我说：你是毛主席的好战士、祖国人民的好儿女，你们保卫祖国的边疆，辛苦了，毛主席派我们来慰问你们。他的热情，使许多人都受到感动。许多生动的事实，都充分说明了各族人民热爱自己的领袖毛主席，热爱自己的军队人民解放军，而我们是毛主席派来的人，是来慰问各族人民所热爱的解放军的，因此也受到各族人民的欢迎和热爱。
    当我写这篇文章的时候，有一种发自内心的激动、幸福和兴奋的感觉。因为我能有机会接受毛主席和全国人民的重托来到新疆和我们最亲爱的人——人民解放军见了面，和他们生活了这么久，看到了他们在祖国富饶的边疆的社会主义建设事业中，用劳动和智慧创造出来的各项光辉成就，这是十分可贵的，是幸福，也是光荣的。这些光荣成就，教育了每一个代表，并决心要把各项成就带回关内各地，带回首都北京，带给毛主席。我将尽我的力量用文字、用语言向全国人民作传达，鼓舞全国人民学习人民解放军忠诚地捍卫祖国，以忘我的劳动热情建设祖国的爱国主义与革命英雄主义的精神，为把我们伟大的祖国建设成一个强大的、无限美好的社会主义社会而努力奋斗！
