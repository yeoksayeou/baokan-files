Shenyang Chemical Plant, according to the production expansion measures plan, is systematically mobilizing workers to tap the potential of the enterprise.

In recent years, the production level of the chemical plant has greatly improved. For example, taking the production of 1950 as 100, it increased to 244 by 1953. However, it still cannot keep up with the needs of various aspects of production development. Therefore, the plant has formulated a plan to expand production measures without adding new equipment. In order to increase the production of caustic soda and chlorine, the plant's employees are adjusting equipment based on advanced Soviet experience and the experience of other brother factories. It is estimated that after this improvement is realized, the annual output of caustic soda can be increased by more than five times compared with 1950. Chlorine is a necessary raw material for the plant to produce bleaching powder and other products. After the chlorine production increases, it will create favorable conditions for the plant to expand the production of other products. At present, the plant's employees are actively implementing the plant's production expansion measures plan, striving to improve the enterprise's production level and meet the needs of national economic construction.

　　沈阳化工厂积极发挥企业潜力扩大生产
    沈阳化工厂根据扩大生产措施方案，正有计划地发动职工挖掘企业潜在力量。
    几年来，化工厂的生产水平已有很大提高，如以一九五○年的生产为一百，到一九五三年则提高了二百四十四。但仍然赶不上各方面发展生产的需要。因此，该厂在不增加新设备的条件下，制订了扩大生产措施方案。该厂职工为增加火碱和氯气的产量，正根据苏联先进经验和其他兄弟工厂的经验调整设备。预计这一改进实现后，火碱的年产量可比一九五○年提高五倍以上。氯气是该厂生产漂白粉等产品的必要原料，氯气产量提高后，就为该厂扩大其他产品的生产量创造了有利条件。目前，该厂职工正在积极执行全厂的扩大生产措施方案，为提高企业生产水平，满足国家经济建设的需要而努力。
