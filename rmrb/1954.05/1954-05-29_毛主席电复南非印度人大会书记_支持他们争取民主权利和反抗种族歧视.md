Xinhua News Agency, dated 28th: The 21st session of the South African Indian Congress of the Union of South Africa will be held on May 29th, 30th, and 31st. The joint honorary secretaries of the Congress, Kachalia and Mistery, sent a letter to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou on April 24th, requesting support for their movement to fight for democratic rights, resist racial discrimination and oppression. Chairman Mao replied on May 28th, expressing full support. The letter and reply are as follows:

    Kachalia and Mistery's letter to Chairman Mao:
    To Chairman Mao Zedong, People's Republic of China:

    The 21st session of the South African Indian Congress will be held on May 29th, 30th, and 31st, 1954, to consider the problems faced by the Indian residents of South Africa. Among other things, it will discuss and decide on ways of struggle to embark on formulating a program of action to secure democratic rights for all people in cooperation with all sections of the people of South Africa.

    People all over the world know that the Union of South Africa is implementing policies that degrade and humiliate millions of non-white people based on race and color. To do this, Prime Minister Dr. Malan is emulating Hitler's fascist tactics, who committed unspeakable crimes against humanity for the same idea of a ruling nation, causing a world war.

    The end of World War II finally established the United Nations Organization for the purpose of peacefully resolving international disputes. But the activities of imperialist countries inside and outside the United Nations show that they do not care about peace. It is this fact that makes the government of the Union of South Africa, allied with the imperialist bloc, resolutely and unreasonably disregard the United Nations resolutions on the treatment of Indian residents in South Africa.

    We are determined to do everything in our power in South Africa to break down racism and oppression. Relying on the unity of all sections of our people and the support of overseas people who are united with us in the common goal of peace and progress, we are moving forward to build a truly democratic South Africa.

    We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to you personally, the government, and the people of your great country for the encouraging support of our cause. We respect and appreciate your position. Your support for the legitimate demands of the South African people has inspired millions of people. From this, we see greater hope for the elimination of the scourge of imperialism that keeps the people of this continent in subjection and suffering.

    Therefore, please allow us to suggest that on the eve of our meeting, you send us a letter expressing your support and congratulations.

    Joint Honorary Secretaries: Yusuf Kachalia, D. U. Mistery
    April 24, 1954

    Chairman Mao's Reply:
    To Mr. Kachalia and Mr. Mistery, Joint Honorary Secretaries of the South African Indian Congress:

    On behalf of the Chinese people, I fully support the just demands of the non-white people of South Africa (including Indians and other Asian and African people) in their struggle for democratic rights and against racial discrimination and oppression. I wish the Congress success in the cause of uniting Indians and all the people of South Africa—white and non-white—in the struggle for peace, freedom, democracy, and progress.

    Mao Zedong, May 28, 1954, Beijing

    毛主席电复南非印度人大会书记
    支持他们争取民主权利和反抗种族歧视
    【新华社二十八日讯】南非联邦南非印度人大会第二十一届会议将于五月二十九、三十及三十一日举行。该会联合名誉书记卡查利亚和米斯特里，于四月二十四日致函毛主席、周总理请求支持他们争取民主权利、反抗种族歧视和压迫的运动，毛主席于五月二十八日复电表示完全支持。来函及复电如下：
      卡查利亚和米斯特里致毛主席函中华人民共和国毛泽东主席先生：
    南非印度人大会第二十一届会议将于一九五四年五月二十九、三十及三十一日举行，考虑南非印度居民面临的问题。在其他问题上，它将讨论并决定斗争的方式，以便在与南非各阶层人民合作下，着手制订一个为一切人们获得民主权利的行动纲领。
    全世界人们都知道，南非联邦正执行着以种族和肤色为理由使数百万非白色人民堕落并受辱的政策。为了这样做，总理马兰博士正仿效着希特勒的法西斯策略，后者为了同样的统治民族的思想，犯下了反人道的难于形容的罪行，而引起了一场世界大战。
    第二次世界大战的结束终于为了和平解决国际争端的目的成立了联合国组织。但是帝国主义国家在联合国内外的活动表明了它们并不关心和平。就是这件事实使得与帝国主义集团同盟的南非联邦政府断然无理地不顾联合国关于南非印度居民待遇问题的决议。
    我们在南非坚决尽我们的一切力量来打破种族主义和压迫。依靠我们人民各阶层的团结一致以及在和平与进步的共同目标上与我们联合起来的海外人民的支持，我们为了建立一个真正民主的南非而向前迈进。
    我们趁此机会向你本人、政府和你们伟大国家的人民对我们事业鼓舞的支持表示感谢。我们尊重和感激你的立场。你对南非人民合法要求的支持鼓舞了数百万人民，从这件事上，我们对消除使这块大陆上人民处于屈从和苦难地位的帝国主义的祸害看到了更大的希望。
    因此，请允许我们向你建议，在我们会议召开的前夜，给我们来信表示支持和祝贺。
    联合名誉书记  优素福·卡查利亚  德·乌·米斯特里
   一九五四年四月二十四日
    毛主席的复电南非印度人大会联合名誉书记卡查利亚米斯特里先生：
    我代表中国人民完全支持南非的非白色人民（包括印度人及其他亚、非人民）争取民主权利、反抗种族歧视和压迫的正义主张。祝大会在团结印度人和所有的南非人民——白色和非白色人民——争取和平、自由、民主与进步的事业中获得成功。
    毛泽东  一九五四年五月二十八日于北京
