Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. The Xi'an Central Shaft, built according to the new Soviet Donbas shaft construction method, is being accelerated and will be handed over for production in November this year. The construction of this shaft is progressing very quickly due to the implementation of advanced Soviet experience and the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions. Since construction began in November 1950, in addition to completing two 500-meter-deep shaft projects, the rock excavation team has completed more than 50 percent of the "underground street", ten-mile-long ventilation and transportation roadways. More than 30 percent of the arching (using stones to build arch-shaped roofs for roadways, etc.) has been completed. The underground tram depot, driving control room, powder magazine, and some major roadways that have been arched are particularly neat and beautiful. The underground water reservoir is currently extending forward at a tunneling speed of four meters per day. On the spacious industrial square above ground, eight buildings, including the main and auxiliary hoist rooms, support processing plant, and warehouse, have been built. The eleven projects under construction, such as the administrative and welfare complex building, and the more than twenty projects that will be started successively, such as the large coal bunker, are expected to be completed by the end of September. Currently, the main shaft headframe and the huge hoist have begun to be installed.

The entire project of the Xi'an Coal Mine Central Shaft is designed according to the new Soviet Donbas mine standards, and the mechanical equipment is also the most modern. After the completion of this shaft, the main and auxiliary production processes will be highly continuous and mechanized. All thin or thick coal seam mining will use Donbas combined coal mining machines or coal cutting machines. After a series of mechanical transfers, nine tons of coal can be lifted from the underground of the main shaft to the ground in one and a half minutes. Then, it will be transported by automatic coal unloading equipment to the coal preparation plant or temporary coal storage warehouse, and then loaded into trains from the coal outlet and transported to various places. The gangue extracted from the auxiliary shaft and the furnace ash from the ground boiler room will also be transported to the gangue yard about three li away from the mine using aerial cableways. In addition, the storage, loading, unloading, and transportation of pit wood in the wood storage yard are carried out using automatic cranes, and all heavy manual labor is replaced by machinery. To protect the health of workers, the safety, hygiene, and labor protection equipment of this shaft is also very complete. There will be sprinkler networks, fire doors, waterproof doors, safety ladders, and clinics underground. The administrative and welfare complex building currently under construction will be equipped with new-style showers, changing rooms, and laundry rooms. After entering this building, miners going to work can change into work clothes, carry their tools, walk from the underground passage to the wellhead, take a cage into the well, and then happily carry out their work through the bright and spacious underground avenue, breathing fresh air.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 21st. A new set of coal seams, about four meters thick, has recently been discovered in the Pingdingshan Coalfield, Henan Province. The coal quality is very good and can be used for coking. The discovery of this new set of coal seams is the third harvest for the Pingdingshan Coalfield exploration team since it started drilling. Prior to this, the exploration team had successively discovered two sets of relatively thick coal seams, "New One" and "New Two," in the Pingdingshan Coalfield. The thickness of the "New Two" coal seam is generally around six meters. The discovery of these three sets of new coal seams has increased the reserves of the Pingdingshan Coalfield by more than four times the original estimate. When the workers discovered the new coal seams, they were both excited and nervous, concentrating on taking out the coal cores in order to accurately understand the coal seam situation. The No. 5 drilling rig was the first to discover this set of new coal seams, followed by the No. 8 and No. 2 drilling rigs. When the No. 8 drilling rig saw coal on April 24, the machine leader Shi Xianting went to control the feed handle on the drilling rig, and the drillers also worked nervously. As a result, more than 90 percent of the coal cores were taken out, greatly exceeding the national quality standards. Currently, the drilling team is continuing to drill on this set of new coal seams, and new drilling rigs have also been added.

    西安煤矿中央竖井建设工程加紧施工
    河南省平顶山煤田又发现一组新煤层
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】按照苏联顿巴斯新式竖井建设的西安中央竖井正在加紧施工，今年十一月就要移交生产。这座竖井的建设由于推行了苏联先进经验和贯彻了苏联专家建议，建设速度很快。从一九五零年十一月开始建设到现在，掘岩队除完成了两个各五百公尺深的井筒工程外，被称做“地下大街”达十里长的通风、运输巷道的掘岩工作已完成了百分之五十以上，发碹（用石头把巷道等砌成拱形顶）已完成百分之三十以上。经过发碹的地下电车库、行车指挥室、火药库和部分主要巷道，显得格外整齐漂亮。地下水仓现正以每日四公尺的掘进速度向前伸展。井上宽阔的工业广场上，主、副井绞车房、支柱加工场、仓库等八个建筑物都已兴建起来了。正在施工的行政福利联合大楼等十一项工程，和将陆续开工的大煤仓等二十多项工程，预计在九月底可以全部完工。现在，主井井架和巨大的绞车已经开始安装。
    西安煤矿中央竖井的全部工程是按照苏联顿巴斯新式矿井标准设计的，机械设备也是最新式的。这座竖井建成后，主要生产过程和辅助生产过程，都将是高度的连续机械化生产。所有薄煤层或厚煤层的开采，使用顿巴斯联合采煤机或用割煤机采出后，经过一系列机械转运，一分半钟就可将九吨煤炭由主井的井下提到地面，再经自动化卸煤装置运到选煤场或临时贮煤仓库，再由出煤口装入火车运往各地。由副井提出的矸石和地面锅炉房的炉灰，也将利用架空索道运到离矿场约有三华里远的矸石场。此外，如贮木场内坑木的存放和装卸、搬运等工作，都是利用自动起重机进行的，一切笨重的体力劳动都为机械所代替。为保障工人身体健康，这座竖井的安全卫生和劳动保护设备也很完善。井下将有喷水网、防火门、防水门、安全梯和诊疗所等。目前正在施工的行政福利联合大楼，将设有新式的淋浴室、更衣室和洗衣室等。上班的矿工们走进这座大楼以后，可以更换了作业服，携带好工具，从地下通路走到井口坐罐笼入井，然后通过明亮坦阔的井下大道，呼吸着新鲜的空气愉快地进行工作。
    【新华社开封二十一日电】河南省平顶山煤田最近又发现了一组新的煤层，厚度约有四公尺，煤质很好，可以炼焦。这组新煤层的发现，是平顶山煤田勘探队开机以来的第三次丰收。在这以前，勘探队曾先后在平顶山煤田发现“新一”、“新二”两组相当厚的煤层，其中“新二”组煤层的厚度一般都在六公尺左右。这三组新煤层的发现，使平顶山煤田的储量比原先估计的增多了四倍以上。当工人们发现新煤层的时候，心情又兴奋又紧张，聚精会神地把煤芯取出来以便精确了解煤层的情况。最早发现这组新煤层的是五号钻机，接着八号、二号等钻机也相继发现。八号钻机在四月二十四日见煤时，机长时显廷就去掌握钻机上的给进把，钻工们也紧张地工作着，结果取出煤芯百分之九十以上，大大超过国家规定的质量标准。现在，钻探队还继续在这组新煤层上进行钻探，并且还增加了新的钻机。
