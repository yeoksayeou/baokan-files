Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 7th. Spokesman of the Chinese Delegation, Huang Hua, issued the following statement at a press conference held on the 7th: Some Western newspapers, based on French sources, claimed that the French request for the withdrawal of wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu had been rejected by the Chinese delegation. This is completely untrue and a deliberate distortion of the report.

As I have said at previous press conferences, the Chinese delegation has always expressed sympathy for resolving the issue of the withdrawal of wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu. The Chinese delegation stated that this issue could be resolved through contact between the belligerent parties at the conference, as the experience of the Korean armistice has proven that this solution is realistic.

On May 5th, personnel from the French delegation visited personnel from the Chinese delegation. It was claimed that the French side was inconvenient to directly contact the Vietnamese delegation and requested the Chinese delegation to act as an intermediary.

On May 6th, the personnel of the Chinese delegation replied to the French side, explaining that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had arrived in Geneva, and discussions on the Indochina issue would begin soon. The French side's issue of withdrawing the wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu would be discussed at the meeting, and both sides could make contact.

As is well known, it was agreed at that time that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference would begin discussing the Indochina issue on May 7th.

However, the French side's raising of the issue of the wounded soldiers in Dien Bien Phu was clearly motivated by ulterior motives and had no serious intention of quickly resolving the issue. Because the discussion on the Indochina issue, originally scheduled for May 7th, was delayed on the evening of May 6th due to the French side's proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 7th. On the afternoon of May 7th, the Press Office of the Soviet Delegation held a press conference at the "Journalists' House" to receive Soviet and foreign journalists covering the Geneva Conference.

The press conference aroused great interest in the press, and hundreds of journalists from various countries participated.

L.F. Ilyichev, Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued the following statement at the reception:

Some foreign newspapers, based on French sources, spread the message that "France's request for a ceasefire in Dien Bien Phu to evacuate the wounded" was allegedly rejected. These newspapers also mentioned that a representative of the French delegation met with a representative of the Chinese delegation on May 6.

The news published by these newspapers is inconsistent with the actual situation and distorts the facts.

Everyone knows that on April 28, the French delegation told the Soviet delegation that it hoped to "resolve the issue of evacuating the wounded from the Dien Bien Phu area." Everyone also knows that the Soviet delegation agreed that the issue of evacuating the wounded should be resolved as soon as possible. In order to resolve this issue in the shortest possible time, representatives of the countries concerned should meet immediately, and if necessary, in Geneva.

It is reported that on May 6, a representative of the French delegation, at his own request, met with a representative of the Chinese delegation, and the evacuation of the wounded from the Dien Bien Phu area was discussed in the talks. It is reported that the representative of the Chinese delegation expressed sympathy for this hope of the French delegation, and said that in order to quickly resolve this issue, it should be discussed at the Foreign Ministers' meeting on May 7 (Friday) when discussing the Indochina issue. The first meeting on the Indochina issue was decided to be held on May 7.

However, the French delegation did not seem interested in this proposal aimed at quickly resolving the evacuation of the wounded. Not only that, on the evening of May 6, the French, British, and American delegations also proposed postponing the discussion on the Indochina issue from May 7 (Friday) to May 8 (Saturday) or May 10 (Monday). These facts show who is delaying the resolution of the evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu, while also spreading rumors to confuse public opinion.

    中苏两国代表团发言人分别发表声明
    驳斥法国方面关于奠边府伤兵问题的谰言
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】中华人民共和国代表团发言人黄华在七日举行的记者招待会上发表声明如下：某些西方报刊根据法国的消息来源宣称，法国方面关于从奠边府撤退伤兵的请求已遭到中国代表团的拒绝。这是完全不符合事实并且是故意歪曲的报道。
    如我在以前的记者招待会上所已说过的，中国代表团对于解决从奠边府撤退伤兵的问题一向是表示同情的。中国代表团表示，这个问题可以由交战双方在会议上接触，加以解决，因为朝鲜停战的经验证明了，这样解决是现实的。
    五月五日，法国代表团的人员曾来访中国代表团的人员，据称法国方面不便直接与越南代表团接洽，要求中国代表团作中间人。
    五月六日，中国代表团的人员回答了法国方面，说明越南民主共和国代表团已抵日内瓦，关于印度支那问题的讨论即可开始，法方关于撤退奠边府伤兵的问题当会在会议中谈到，双方即可进行接触。
    如所周知，当时已经协议五月七日日内瓦外长会议即将开始讨论印度支那问题。
    但是法国方面之提出奠边府伤兵问题，显系别有用心，并无认真要求迅速解决这一问题之意。因为原定于五月七日举行的印度支那问题的讨论，在五月六日晚上，由于法国方面的建议而被延迟了。
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】五月七日下午，苏联代表团新闻处在“记者之家”举行记者招待会，招待采访日内瓦会议的苏联和外国记者。
    记者招待会引起了新闻界很大的兴趣，有各国几百个记者参加。
    苏联外交部新闻司司长勒·弗·伊利切夫在招待会上发表了下列声明：
    某些外国报纸根据法国方面的消息来源散布消息说：“法国提出的在奠边府实行休战以撤退伤兵的要求”据说遭到了拒绝。这些报纸并提到法国代表团的一个代表在五月六日会见了中华人民共和国代表团的一个代表的事情。
    这些报纸所发表的消息是与实际情况不符合，并歪曲了事实的。
    大家知道，在四月二十八日，法国代表团向苏联代表团表示，它希望“解决撤退奠边府地区伤兵的问题”。大家也知道，苏联代表团同意撤退伤兵的问题应该尽速解决，为了在最短时间内解决这个问题，有关各国的代表应该立即开会，如果有必要的话，就在日内瓦开会。
    据悉，在五月六日，法国代表团的一个代表，在他自己的请求之下，会见了中华人民共和国代表团的一个代表，在会谈中谈到了从奠边府地区撤退伤兵的问题。据悉，中华人民共和国代表团的代表对法国代表团的这个希望表示同情，并表示为了迅速解决这个问题，应该在五月七日（星期五）外长会议讨论印度支那问题时讨论这个问题。关于印度支那问题的第一次会议是决定在五月七日举行的。
    但是，法国代表团似乎对这个目的在迅速解决撤退伤兵问题的建议不感兴趣。不仅如此，在五月六日晚上，法国、英国和美国代表团还建议把关于印度支那问题的讨论从五月七日（星期五）推迟到五月八日（星期六）或五月十日（星期一）。这些事实说明了，是谁在拖延解决自奠边府撤退伤兵的问题，同时还散布谣言以迷惑舆论。
