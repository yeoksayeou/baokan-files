    "The Exhibition of the Dissemination of Marxist-Leninist Classic Works in China"
    To be Moved to the Beijing Library on May 4th

    In March of this year, the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an exhibition in Beijing on "The Dissemination of Marxist-Leninist Classic Works in China," which received much attention from all sides. During the exhibition, a total of more than 250 units and more than 6,000 people visited. The audience unanimously believed that after seeing the exhibition, they had a general understanding of the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism in China. They said: "The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. We have a deep understanding of 'Once theory grips the masses, it immediately becomes a material force' (Marx)." Many comrades from the Library Specialist Program of Peking University, after visiting, believed that the exhibition provided valuable materials. They copied all the explanatory texts in the exhibition as a reference for their studies.

    Now, in order to meet the requirements of people from all walks of life, it has been decided to move this exhibition to the Beijing Library and rearrange it. It will open on the afternoon of May 4th.

    “马克思列宁主义经典著作在中国的传播”展览会
    五月四日起移到北京图书馆展出
    今年三月间，中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局曾在北京举办“马克思列宁主义经典著作在中国的传播”展览会，受到各方的重视。在展览期间共有二百五十余单位、六千余人前往参观。观众一致认为，看过展览会后对马克思列宁主义在中国的传播情况有了概括的了解，他们说：“中国革命的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利。对‘理论一掌握了群众，就立刻成为物质的力量’（马克思）有了深刻的认识。”北京大学图书馆专修科的许多同志在参观后，认为展览会提供了宝贵的资料，他们把展览会中的说明文字全部抄录下来，作为学习的参考。
    现为满足各界人民的要求，决定将这一展览会迁至北京图书馆，并重加布置，于五月四日下午开幕。
