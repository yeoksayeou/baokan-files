Establishing and Running Circuit Courts

The main task of the people's judicial work during the transition period of our country is to strengthen and use judicial weapons to fight against all criminal acts, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist industrialization and various socialist transformations, and protect the people's democratic rights from infringement.

In the vast rural areas of our country, after successive social reform movements, the revolutionary order has been basically stabilized; however, hidden counter-revolutionaries and reactionary landlord class elements are still trying their best to sabotage our social order and undermine agricultural production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the implementation of the planned purchase and supply of grain; at the same time, among the people, due to various historical reasons, some criminal acts and various disputes that hinder mutual unity also often occur. If our people's judicial organs cannot promptly suppress the sabotage activities of the remaining counter-revolutionaries and handle certain criminal acts and disputes among the people, it will be impossible to ensure that the peasants' enthusiasm for production and socialist enthusiasm continue to be brought into play, and it will be impossible to ensure the smooth completion of the state's socialist transformation of agriculture. Moreover, due to the extreme dispersion of villages, some remote districts and townships are more than one or two hundred li away from the county seat, coupled with inconvenient transportation, this has created special difficulties for the county people's courts in handling rural cases. Many incidents occur for a long time before the county court knows about them; cases that have already been filed in the court also cannot be resolved in a timely manner due to the court's insufficient manpower and difficulties in investigating the case, and a large number of cases are backlogged for a long time. If this situation is not changed quickly, the effectiveness of the people's judicial organs in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, curbing crimes, eliminating disputes, protecting mutual aid and cooperation, and promoting agricultural production will be difficult to bring into play. The Second National Judicial Conference summarized the experience of circuit trials across the country and decided to gradually establish circuit courts in county people's courts, which is an important measure to solve the above-mentioned problems at present.

The establishment of circuit courts has initially solved the difficulties caused by the vast and dispersed rural areas to judicial work in terms of geography. It not only greatly facilitates mass litigation and saves a lot of time and money wasted by the masses traveling long distances to and from the county seat, but more importantly, because timely handling of cases that hinder rural production can effectively protect and promote agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation, and the smooth progress of other rural work. Circuit courts that go deep into districts and townships to conduct trial work can easily understand the specific local conditions, discover problems at any time, and conduct investigations and handling in a timely and proactive manner. For the cases received, they can also conduct trials in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the circumstances, importance and urgency, to ensure the timely and rapid handling of cases that the masses are eager to solve and that endanger rural work. Circuit courts in many counties in Shandong, Anhui, Sichuan, Liaodong and other provinces have played a great role in the unified purchase and sale of grain, in the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and in ensuring agricultural production. This is not only due to the efforts of the cadres of the circuit courts, but also due to the great advantages of the organizational form and working methods of the circuit courts themselves.

Establishing circuit courts can better implement the mass line of judicial work, improve the efficiency of handling cases, gradually solve some of the difficulties of insufficient manpower and inability to cope with the county people's courts, and change the current busy and passive state of some courts. This is because: First, circuit courts facilitate the people's courts to help and guide the work of the people's mediation committees. If litigation cases occurring in the vast rural areas are concentrated in the county people's courts for handling, it will be difficult to handle them with the current strength of the courts. One of the most effective ways to solve this problem is to give full play to the role of the people's mediation committees in villages and towns. To give full play to the role of the people's mediation committees, it is necessary to greatly strengthen the court's guidance and specific assistance to the people's mediation committees. Circuit courts that go deep into districts and townships to conduct trial work can check and guide the mediation work of villages and towns at any time, and conduct policy education and business education to the mediation committee members, and help solve difficult problems. When hearing or mediating cases, mediation committee members can be allowed to sit in on the sidelines, using specific examples to help them improve their work ability and policy level, so that the people's mediation committees can mediate civil disputes in a timely and correct manner, which can greatly reduce the people's courts' direct handling of cases that can be mediated, so that the courts can concentrate their efforts on handling important cases. Second, circuit courts facilitate the implementation of the people's assessor system, so that people's assessors can participate in trial work without delaying or delaying production as little as possible, so that trial work can better rely on the support of the people. Third, circuit courts can more conveniently closely contact local district and township cadres and the people, and rely on them to conduct on-the-spot case investigations, so that cases can be handled correctly and quickly. Fourth, when circuit courts hear or mediate cases, local people are often attracted to attend the hearing, which turns the court into a forum for conducting legal education and propaganda. If the masses can be organized and mobilized to attend the hearing in a planned way, the masses can be more often educated on patriotism and law-abiding, and prevent and reduce litigation cases and civil disputes.

In the past year, especially since last winter, the people's courts in many counties across the country have attached importance to the establishment of circuit courts. In places where circuit courts have been established and done relatively well, they have not only effectively guaranteed the smooth progress of agricultural production and the central work in rural areas at various stages, but also significantly improved the efficiency of handling cases, reduced backlogged cases, promoted unity within the people, and strengthened the connection between the people's courts and the masses, and have been warmly welcomed by farmers and district and township cadres. However, at present, there are still many county people's courts that do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of establishing circuit courts and have not actively and seriously carried out this work. The main reason is that they artificially juxtapose the work of circuit courts with the work of handling backlogged cases. They said: "There are now many backlogged cases, and we can't spare time to establish circuit courts." They do not understand that the establishment of circuit courts is an important measure to reduce backlogged cases and overcome the busy and passive state of grassroots courts. For example, the Wangjiang County People's Court in Anhui Province often had 70 or 80 backlogged cases before August last year. After the establishment of three circuit courts, the number of backlogged cases gradually decreased. In December last year, the court and the three circuit courts had only more than 30 newly received and unsettled cases. This shows that the idea and practice of attempting to establish circuit courts after the backlogged cases are handled is wrong. Burying oneself in the court to clear backlogged cases will only make the court's work more passive. It is necessary to actively establish and improve circuit courts in order to gradually reduce and finally eliminate backlogged cases.

On the other hand, there are also some county people's courts that do not regard circuit courts as a system and fundamental judicial construction work, but simply understand circuit courts as circuit on-the-spot trials, which are temporary means of clearing backlogged cases or handling a certain complex case. Therefore, the work is limited to carrying case files to the countryside for circuit trials, or only being satisfied with sending out some circuit trial teams, which try cases wherever they go, without several fixed trial locations, times and working systems. In this way, it is difficult for them to closely contact local cadres and the masses, actively and proactively understand local conditions and problems, and use judicial weapons to cooperate with and guarantee agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation, and other rural work; it is also not convenient to guide civil mediation organizations, establish the people's assessor system, and conduct legal propaganda and education. This kind of blitzkrieg method of carrying cases to the countryside and trying cases wherever they go makes the trial personnel waste too much time on walking during the circuit, and also causes the phenomenon of the masses chasing the circuit teams everywhere, which is inconvenient for some people who are eager to solve problems. This situation must be changed quickly. The practices and other experiences of Wangjiang County Circuit Court in Anhui Province, such as fixed areas for circuit activities, fixed trial personnel for the court, fixed trial dates, fixed personnel for collecting cases, and closely contacting and relying on local cadres and the masses, combined with the local central work at that time, are better and can be used as a reference for circuit courts in various places when establishing and carrying out work.

Circuit courts are an important facility in our country's people's judicial work and have been legally stipulated in the "Provisional Organizational Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China". The Second National Judicial Conference also decided that county people's courts should gradually and universally establish circuit courts; after a recent period of practice, more complete experience in running circuit courts has been obtained. The people's courts in various counties must fully absorb successful experiences, and establish and improve circuit courts universally in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that judicial work can go deep into the countryside and better serve agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Party and government leading organs in various places should also actively urge and lead the people's courts of their subordinate counties to do this work well.

### 建立和办好巡回法庭

    建立和办好巡回法庭
    人民司法工作在国家过渡时期的主要任务，是加强和运用司法武器，与一切犯罪行为作斗争，进一步巩固人民民主专政，保障国家社会主义工业化和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，保障人民民主权利不受侵犯。
    我国广大农村，经过历次的社会改革运动，革命秩序已基本稳定；但是隐藏的反革命分子和反动地主阶级分子还在千方百计地破坏我们的社会秩序，破坏农业生产、互助合作运动和粮食计划收购计划供应政策的推行；同时在人民群众中，因为各种历史原因，也常常发生一些犯罪行为和妨碍彼此团结的各种纠纷。我们的人民司法机关如果不能及时镇压残余反革命分子的破坏活动，处理某些犯罪行为和人民群众中的纠纷事件，就不可能保证农民的生产热情和社会主义热情继续发挥，就不可能保证国家对农业的社会主义改造事业的顺利完成。而且由于村庄极其分散，偏远的区乡有距县城远达一二百里以上的，再加上交通不便，这就使得县人民法院在处理农村案件上发生了特殊的困难。有许多事件发生很久，县法院还不知道；已经在法院起诉的案件，也因法院人力不足和调查案情上的困难，得不到及时的解决，大批案件长期积压起来。这种情况如不迅速加以改变，人民司法机关在镇压反革命、制止犯罪、消除纠纷、保护互助合作和促进农业生产方面的效能就很难发挥。第二届全国司法会议总结了全国各地巡回审判的经验，决定在县人民法院逐渐普遍建立巡回法庭，就是在目前解决上述问题的重要措施。
    建立巡回法庭，使辽阔分散的农村在地理上给司法工作造成的困难得到了初步解决，不仅可以大大便利群众诉讼，省去许多群众往返县城长途跋涉所浪费的时间和金钱，更重要的是因为及时地处理妨碍农村生产的案件，可以有效地保护和推动农业生产、互助合作和其他农村工作的顺利进行。巡回法庭深入区乡进行审判工作，很容易了解当地的具体情况，随时发现问题，及时主动地进行调查处理。对于所收到的案件，也可以根据所了解的情况，分别轻重缓急，有计划有步骤地进行审判，保证及时迅速地处理群众切望解决的危害农村工作的案件。山东、安徽、四川、辽东等省许多县的巡回法庭在粮食统购统销中，在发展互助合作组织中，以及在保障农业生产中，都曾起了很大的作用。这不仅是由于巡回法庭干部的努力，而且是由于巡回法庭这一组织形式和工作方式本身具有很大的优越性。
    建立巡回法庭，能够更好地贯彻司法工作的群众路线，提高办案的效率，逐步解决县人民法院人手不足力不胜任的一部分困难，改变目前法院所处的一部分忙乱被动状态。这是由于：第一，巡回法庭便于人民法院帮助与指导人民调解委员会的工作。广大农村中发生的诉讼案件，如果集中到县人民法院处理，以目前法院的力量，是很难处理过来的。解决这一问题的最有效的办法之一，是充分发挥乡村中的人民调解委员会的作用。要充分发挥人民调解委员会的作用，就必须大大加强法院对人民调解委员会的指导和具体帮助。巡回法庭深入区乡进行审判工作，就可以随时检查与指导乡村的调解工作，并向调解委员进行政策教育和业务教育，帮助解决疑难问题。在审理或调解案件时，可以让调解委员旁听，用具体事例帮助他们提高工作能力和政策水平，使人民调解委员会能够及时正确地调解民间纠纷，这就可以大大减少人民法院直接处理可以调解的案件，使法院能集中力量处理重要的案件。第二，巡回法庭便利于贯彻实现人民陪审制，使人民陪审员能够在不耽误或少耽误生产的条件下参加审判工作，使审判工作更好地依靠人民群众的支持来进行。第三，巡回法庭可以更方便地密切联系当地区乡干部和人民群众，并依靠他们就地进行案情调查，使案件处理得正确而迅速。第四，巡回法庭在审理或调解案件时，当地群众时常被吸引去旁听，这就把法庭变成了进行法纪教育和宣传的讲坛。如果能有计划地组织和动员群众旁听，就更能使群众经常受到爱国守法教育，预防和减少诉讼案件和民间纠纷。
    近一年来，特别是去冬以来，全国有许多县份的人民法院重视了建立巡回法庭的工作。凡是已经建立巡回法庭并且做得比较好的地方，不仅有效地保障了农业生产和农村中各个时期中心工作的顺利进行，而且办案效率显著提高，减少了积案，增进了人民内部的团结，加强了人民法院和群众的联系，受到了农民和区乡干部的热烈欢迎。但是，目前仍然有不少的县人民法院对建立巡回法庭的意义认识不足，没有积极认真地进行这一工作。主要的原因，是他们把巡回法庭工作和处理积案的工作人为地对立起来了。他们说：“现在积案很多，腾不出手来建立巡回法庭。”他们不了解建立巡回法庭正是减少积案、克服基层法院工作忙乱被动状态的一项重要措施。如安徽望江县人民法院，去年八月以前积案经常有七八十件，三个巡回法庭建立以后，积案数字就逐渐下降，去年十二月该院和三个巡回法庭仅有新收未结案的案件三十余件。这就说明，那些企图在积案处理完毕后再建立巡回法庭的想法和作法，是错误的。埋头在法院清理积案，只有使法院工作更加被动。必须积极地建立和健全巡回法庭，才能逐渐减少以至最后消灭积案。
    另一方面，也有一些县的人民法院不是把巡回法庭当成一种制度和根本的司法建设工作，而是把巡回法庭简单地理解为巡回就地审判，是临时性的清理积案或处理某一复杂案件的手段。因此工作只限于携卷下乡巡回审案，或者是只满足于派出一些巡回审判小组，随走随审，没有若干固定的审判地点、时间和工作制度。这样他们就很难密切联系当地的干部和群众，积极主动地了解当地情况和问题，用司法武器配合和保障农业生产、互助合作和其他农村工作；也不便于指导民间调解组织、建立人民陪审制和进行法纪宣传教育。这种突击式地携案下乡随走随审的办法，使审判人员耽误在巡回途中走路的时间过多，而且发生了群众到处追寻巡回小组的现象，对于某些急于要解决问题的群众，反而不便。这种情况必须迅速加以改变。安徽省望江县巡回法庭所实行的固定巡回活动的地区、固定法庭的审判人员、固定开庭审判日期、固定代收案件的人员，密切联系和依靠当地区乡干部和群众，结合当地当时中心工作审理案件的做法和其他经验，都是较好的，可供各地巡回法庭在建立和进行工作时的参考。
    巡回法庭是我国人民司法工作中的一项重要设施，并已在“中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例”中作了法律规定。第二届全国司法会议又决定县人民法院应逐步普遍地建立巡回法庭；经过最近一个时期的实践，又获得了办好巡回法庭的比较完整的经验。各县人民法院必须充分吸取成功的经验，有计划、有步骤地普遍把巡回法庭建立与健全起来，使司法工作深入农村，更好地为农业生产和农业的社会主义改造事业服务。各地党政领导机关也应该积极督促和领导所属县的人民法院做好这一工作。
