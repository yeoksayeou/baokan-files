    Factories Under the East China Iron and Steel Company Achieve Remarkable Results in Implementing Soviet Expert Recommendations in the First Quarter
    [This newspaper, Shanghai, 19th dispatch] Factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company have achieved great success in implementing the recommendations of Soviet experts in the first quarter of production. According to statistics from the East China Iron and Steel Company and its seven affiliated factories, a total of 226 recommendations were made by Soviet experts in the first quarter of this year. Of these, 117 have been implemented and 18 are in the process of being implemented, with the exception of some larger recommendations that are not easily implemented in a short period.
    During this period, all factories formulated plans for implementing the recommendations of Soviet experts and designated specific personnel to be responsible. Units that have seriously implemented the recommendations of Soviet experts have achieved significant results in improving equipment utilization, increasing production and quality, and reducing labor intensity. For example, in order to implement expert recommendations, the Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant organized three groups for rolling steel, mechanical and electrical engineering, and horseshoe iron, under the specific leadership of the chief engineer. They reported on the implementation of expert recommendations at weekend meetings every week, discussed and resolved difficulties, and publicized the achievements made in implementing expert recommendations through meetings, broadcasts, and other forms of publicity, encouraging the workers to learn from advanced Soviet experience. The rolling steel workshop of the plant adopted a Soviet expert's recommendation to add a waist furnace to the steel soaking furnace, which expanded the steel soaking capacity, solved the problem of the rolling mill waiting for hot materials, increased production by 24.7%, and reduced costs, which can increase production and save 480 million yuan for the country throughout the year. In the past, the Asia Iron and Steel Plant required 20 people to spend 30 minutes making a small furnace of 150 cm steel ingots. By adopting a Soviet expert's recommendation to improve the "demolding" method of steel ingots, now only five people are needed to spend 10 minutes, which greatly reduces labor intensity and improves product quality. Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 adopted the Soviet expert's recommendation to the Tianjin Steel Plant to use a checkerboard furnace roof, which extended the furnace life from 190 heats to 244 heats.

    华东钢铁公司所属各厂在第一季度中
    贯彻苏联专家建议收到显著效果
    【本报上海十九日电】华东钢铁公司所属各厂，在第一季度生产中贯彻苏联专家建议，获得很大成就。据华东钢铁公司和所属七个厂的统计：在今年第一季度中，苏联专家建议共二百二十六件，除有些较大的建议一时不容易实现外，已执行的有一百十七件，正在执行的有十八件。
    在这一期间，各厂对执行苏联专家建议都拟订了计划，并指定了专人负责。凡是认真执行苏联专家建议的单位，在提高设备利用率、提高产量和质量以及减低劳动强度等方面都有了很大的效果。如新沪钢铁厂为执行专家建议，组织了轧钢、机电、马铁三个小组，由总工程师具体领导进行工作。他们每周在周末会议上汇报专家建议执行情况，遇到困难就讨论解决，并通过会议、广播等宣传形式，宣传执行专家建议所获得的成绩，鼓舞职工群众学习苏联先进经验。该厂轧钢车间采取苏联专家建议在烘钢炉加一座腰炉，扩大了烘钢能力，解决了轧钢机待热料的现象，使产量提高百分之二十四点七，并降低了成本，全年可为国家增产节约四亿八千万元。亚细亚钢铁厂过去出一小炉一五零糎钢锭要二十个人做三十分钟，采用苏联专家建议改进了钢锭“脱模”办法，现在只要五个人做十分钟，且大大减低了劳动强度，提高了产品质量。上海钢铁第一厂采用了苏联专家对天津钢厂的建议，使用格子型炉顶，使炉龄由一百九十炉延长到二百四十四炉。
