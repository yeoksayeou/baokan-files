Xinhua News Agency, 8th of May. Gifts presented by people from all walks of life in Korea to Chairman Mao have been put on display at the Palace Museum's Zhongcui Palace, and will open for exhibition on the 9th.

The gifts total 39 types, 147 pieces. Among the gifts are the "Sitting Statue of Chairman Mao Zedong" sculpted by Korean artist Kim In-ho, the "Portrait of Chairman Mao" meticulously embroidered by Korean women, bronze statues of "Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers," sculptures of "Korean-Chinese Friendship Mass Dance," embroidery of "Autumn of Friendship," oil paintings such as "Luo Shengjiao Rescuing Cui?" which reflect the great friendship of internationalism between the Chinese and Korean peoples, as well as oil paintings reflecting the high patriotic spirit of the Korean people such as "Assault Battle of 854.1 Highland" and "Matrosov-style Hero Li Shoufu," Korean oriental paintings such as "Plowing" and "Road Construction," and various Korean genre paintings reflecting the Korean people's love for labor, peace, and culture.

Among the gifts, many were made by the heroic warriors of the Korean People's Army guarding the "1211 Highland," known as "Heartbreak Ridge" by the enemy on the eastern front of Korea, and other heroic positions. During breaks in the fierce battles with the enemy, they used communication lines, parachute silk lines, artillery shell skins, enemy aircraft wings seized from the enemy, and wood taken from the famous Mount Kumgang and various battlefields such as paulownia, sandalwood, and oak to make a large number of "frontline musical instruments" and "frontline daily necessities." These gifts vividly reflect the revolutionary optimism of the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army.

The Korean people also presented Chairman Mao with various crafts, folk musical instruments, and hand-woven items that they cherish the most and that are rich in Korean national characteristics. On a "Six-Panel Screen," Korean women exquisitely embroidered the morning of "Haegeumgang," one of Korea's most beautiful scenic spots. Around the screen are embroidered patterns symbolizing congratulations to Chairman Mao for "Boundless Longevity." Among the various industrial products presented by all the citizens of Pyongyang, there is a "Vase" made entirely of Korean-produced linen and lacquer, a famous dry lacquer craft product in the history of craftsmanship. This vase is light and strong, and can last for a long time even when placed in the soil. The vase is decorated with Mount Kumgang and honeysuckle patterns from the Goguryeo era. The front of the vase is carved with a portrait of Chairman Mao, and the back is written with a poem praising the Chinese People's Volunteers and Chairman Mao Zedong.

These gifts fully express the Korean people's infinite respect and love for the Chinese people and the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao.
