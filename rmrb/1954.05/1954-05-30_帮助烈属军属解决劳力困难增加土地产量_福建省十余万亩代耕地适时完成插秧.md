Helping Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel Solve Labor Shortages and Increase Land Yield
    Over 100,000 Mu of 代耕 Land in Fujian Province Completed Rice Transplanting in a Timely Manner
    In Fujian Province, over 100,000 mu of land belonging to poor families of martyrs and military personnel lacking labor, and entitled to 代耕 (cultivation on their behalf), have all been transplanted with rice seedlings in a timely manner.
    This year's 代耕 work during the spring plowing season has been done better than in previous years. Party and government leaders in various places have promptly arranged the 代耕 work. Mutual aid teams and the masses responsible for 代耕 have universally put forward the slogan "Martyrs' and military families first, then ourselves," giving priority to transplanting rice seedlings on the 代耕 land. In Baishan Township, Jinjiang, rice transplanting on 代耕 land was earlier than on ordinary land in the area. The Lai Jiamou mutual aid team, which was 代耕 six fen of land for Huang Kan Niang, a military family member, encountered drought. The team members watered the fields overnight and transplanted the seedlings five days ahead of schedule. The Zhu Yishou mutual aid team in Fuxing Township, Pinghe, which contracted to cultivate 3.6 mu of land for Zhu Rongren, a military family member, not only adopted appropriate close planting to transplant the rice seedlings first but also prepared to apply reasonable fertilization to strive for a 12% increase in production. In Qianhuo mutual aid team, Chendai Town, Yunxiao, in addition to doing a good job in 代耕, they also proactively helped poor families of martyrs and military personnel lacking labor with pig raising, flour milling, rice pounding, vegetable planting, and manure collection. During spring plowing, basic construction work was done on 代耕 land in various places to ensure the practical guarantee of the production income of the families of martyrs and military personnel. Zhang Fa Yuan, a military family member in Xiayang Township, Lianjiang, had 2.5 mu of land with a poor terrain, often suffering from waterlogging and drought. The Zhang Xingkun mutual aid team specially built a small dam and a canal for him, freeing the land from the threat of flood and drought, and it is estimated that production can be increased by 50% this year. The Chen Xitiao mutual aid team in Baimei Township, Changle, dug 210 dan of river mud to improve the soil of 2.3 mu of land for Chen Xizhuo, a military family member.
    Before the spring plowing, various counties also preliminarily rectified the 代耕 work, reasonably expanded the 代耕 service surface, reduced the 代耕 surface, promoted the fixed 代耕 system, and paid attention to the combination of 代耕 and mutual aid cooperative organizations. Minhou County rectified the 代耕 work in 179 townships before the spring plowing. In Dongshan, Changtai, Nanjing, and Zhangpu counties, fixed 代耕 in mutual aid cooperative organizations accounted for 60% of the total number of 代耕 households. After Xiadu Township in Changting rectified the 代耕 work, all the labor force that should provide the service participated in the 代耕. In the past, each labor force had to bear eleven 代耕 workdays, but this year only two workdays are needed.

    帮助烈属军属解决劳力困难增加土地产量
    福建省十余万亩代耕地适时完成插秧
    福建省缺乏劳动力的贫苦烈、军属，有十余万亩应享受代耕的土地，都适时插下了秧苗。
    今年春耕季节的代耕工作比往年做得更好，各地党、政领导都及时地布置了代耕工作，负责代耕的互助组和群众普遍提出“先烈军属，后自己”的口号，尽先让代耕土地插上秧苗。晋江柏山乡代耕土地插秧比当地一般土地都早，赖家谋互助组给军属黄看娘代耕的六分地碰到干旱，组员们连夜车水灌田，提前五天插下了秧。平和复兴乡朱益寿互助组，包耕军属朱荣忍的三亩六分土地，不但采用适当密植先插上秧，还准备进行合理施肥，争取增产一成二。云霄陈岱镇乾火互助组，除了做好代耕工作外，还主动帮助贫苦无劳力的烈军属养猪、磨粉、舂米、种菜、拾粪。春耕中，各地代耕土地都作了一些基本建设工作，使烈军属的生产收入得到切实的保证。连江下洋乡军属张发元的二亩五分土地，地势不好，经常受涝受旱，张兴坤互助组特地为他筑了一道小水坝，修了一条水渠，使这块地免除了水旱灾威胁，估计今年就能增产五成。长乐白眉乡陈希钿互助组，挖了二百一十担河泥，给军属陈希灼改良了二亩三分地的土壤。
    各县并在春耕前初步整顿了代耕工作，合理地扩大了代耕服勤面，缩小了代耕面，推广了固定代耕制，并注意代耕和互助合作组织相结合。闽侯县在春耕前整顿了一百七十九个乡的代耕工作。东山、长泰、南靖、漳浦四县，结合在互助合作组织固定代耕的占代耕总户数百分之六十。长汀下都乡整顿代耕工作后，该服勤的劳力都参加了代耕，过去每个劳力要负担十一个代耕工，今年只要出两个工就够了。
