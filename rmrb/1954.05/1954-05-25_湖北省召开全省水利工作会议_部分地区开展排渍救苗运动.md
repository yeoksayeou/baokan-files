Hubei Province Holds Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference; Some Areas Launch Waterlogging Drainage and Seedling Rescue Campaign

The Hubei Provincial People's Government convened a provincial water conservancy work conference from May 3rd to 16th to deploy flood and drought prevention work. In recent years, Hubei Province's water conservancy construction has greatly developed, and water and drought disasters have been reduced year by year. After several years of fighting water and drought disasters, cadres and the masses throughout the province have accumulated rich experience. From last winter to this spring, a total of 253,540 large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects were built throughout the province. The dikes of the main streams and tributaries of the Yangtze River and Han River have been universally repaired, the dike bodies have been consolidated, and the flood resistance capacity has been enhanced. In the areas of the province most prone to drought, pumping stations have been established as a priority, possessing 3,800 horsepower of water pumps. These are all favorable conditions for this year's flood and drought prevention.

Since the beginning of summer, the Jianghan Plain has experienced heavy rainfall, and some areas have suffered from mountain floods and waterlogging disasters. Leaders at all levels are vigorously organizing the masses to drain waterlogging and rescue seedlings. Members of the Honghu County Committee of the Communist Party of China went to various districts to hold emergency meetings and conducted on-site guidance in areas severely affected by waterlogging. Mianyang County established county and district waterlogging drainage headquarters and transferred cadres from county-level units to participate in the waterlogging drainage campaign. In many areas of the county, the masses worked at night with lanterns and torches to drain waterlogging. Under the leadership of cooperatives and mutual aid groups, Xima Township in the Seventh District organized 160 waterwheels to rescue 548 mu of rice fields. The Xishui County People's Government allocated four water pumps to help the masses drain water in the Lanxi District, rescuing more than 1,000 mu of rice fields. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government have decided to organize two working groups to visit and inspect the areas severely affected by waterlogging immediately. At the same time, the Provincial People's Government instructed the areas affected by waterlogging to continue to vigorously drain waterlogging and rescue seedlings. For fields where waterlogging cannot be eliminated in a short period of time, preparations should be made as soon as possible to replant late rice or other crops. (Cai Guangyao, Gu Weijin)

    湖北省召开全省水利工作会议
    部分地区开展排渍救苗运动
    湖北省人民政府于五月三日到十六日召开全省水利工作会议，布置防汛防旱工作。几年来，湖北省水利建设有很大发展，水、旱灾害逐年减轻。全省干部和群众经过几年来和水旱灾害斗争，已积累了丰富的经验。去冬今春全省兴修大、中、小型水利工程共二十五万三千五百四十处。长江、汉水的干流和支流的堤防，普遍进行了培修，巩固了堤身，增强了抗洪能力。在全省最易受旱的地区，重点设立了抽水机站，拥有三千八百马力抽水机。这些都是今年防汛、防旱的有利条件。
    入夏以来，江汉平原雨量较多，有些地方已发生山洪和渍水的灾害，各级领导正大力组织群众排渍救苗。中共洪湖县委委员都分头到各区召开紧急会议，并到受渍严重地区进行现场指导。沔阳县成立了县、区排渍指挥部，并抽调县直属单位的干部投入排渍运动。该县不少地区的群众夜里打起灯笼火把进行排渍，七区洗马乡在合作社和互助组带领下，组织了一百六十部水车，抢救出五百四十八亩秧田。浠水县人民政府调拨四部抽水机在兰溪区帮助群众排水，救出一千多亩秧田。现中共湖北省委和省人民政府已决定组织两个工作组，即日分赴受渍严重地区进行慰问、检查，同时省人民政府指示各受渍地区除继续大力排渍救苗外，对在短时间不能排除渍水的田地，应及早准备改种晚谷或其他作物。  （蔡光耀　古维进）
