Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi Province is harvesting over 2,569,000 mu of rapeseed in succession. The southern region and parts of the Poyang Lake plain have completed their harvest.

Under the impetus of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province fought against natural disasters such as severe cold, continuous rain, frost, and insect pests last winter and this spring. Therefore, the total rapeseed production of the province is still considerable. Poyang County, known as the "Jiangxi Oil Depot," experienced several consecutive rainfalls last winter, resulting in uneven seedling emergence and some instances of seedling rot on over 100,000 mu of rapeseed. At that time, driven by sixty agricultural production cooperatives and over ten thousand mutual aid teams, most of the rapeseed farmers implemented rescue measures such as ditching for drainage, transplanting seedlings, and replanting, while also seizing sunny days to weed and apply fertilizer. This year, the county still has a good rapeseed harvest. Farmers in Ruijin, Xingguo, Yiyang, Yongxin and other counties generally cultivated and fertilized the rapeseed two to three times, thus increasing both the harvested area and the yield per unit area compared to last year.

    江西省收获油菜籽
    据新华社讯：江西省二百五十六万九千多亩油菜籽正陆续收获。南部地区和鄱阳湖滨平原部分地区已收获完毕。
    江西省各地种植油菜的农民在互助合作组织的带动下，去冬今春曾和严寒、霪雨、霜冻、虫害等自然灾害进行了斗争。因此，全省油菜籽总产量仍很可观。被人们誉为“江西油库”的鄱阳县，去年冬季曾连续下了几场雨，十万多亩油菜普遍出苗不齐，有的发生烂苗现象。当时在六十个农业生产合作社和一万多个互助组的带动下，种植油菜的农民大部以开沟排水、移苗补苗、点种补种等办法进行抢救，并抓紧晴天耘草追肥。今年全县油菜籽仍有较好的收成。瑞金、兴国、弋阳、永新等县农民一般对油菜中耕施肥两次到三次以上，因而油菜籽的收获面积和单位面积产量都比去年增加。
