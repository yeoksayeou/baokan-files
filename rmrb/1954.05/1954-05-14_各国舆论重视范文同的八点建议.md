    International Opinion Emphasizes Pham Van Dong's Eight-Point Proposal
    Soviet Union
    The "Pravda" correspondents in Geneva, Zhukov, Prischevsky, and Rasagin, wrote in a dispatch on May 12th titled "A Practical Plan for Restoring Peace in Indochina": The plan for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, proposed by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 10th, provides a realistic basis for discussing the substantive issues of the dispute.
    The correspondents pointed out: The plan is even more impressive because the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took a very humane step with great moral force on May 10th, advocating for an immediate agreement to transport all seriously wounded French soldiers (regardless of nationality) from Dien Bien Phu.
    In this regard, the correspondents pointed out that the initiative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's delegation made it possible to resolve the above issues.
    The correspondents further commented on the press conference held by Hoang Van Hoan, spokesman for the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on May 10th. The "Pravda" correspondents wrote: The eight-point peace plan proposed by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has aroused great interest. Foreign journalists in Geneva pointed out that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward a reasonable plan for ending hostilities, which would be completely satisfactory to France if the French delegation acted in accordance with the national interests of their country, rather than according to the "opinions" of the US State Department.
    After the press conference, reporters received the full text of the speech by Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The "Pravda" correspondents quoted the spokesman of the French delegation, Béguin, as saying that Bidault even believed that Pham Van Dong's proposal could not be accepted as a basis for negotiation.
    The correspondents wrote: Well-informed reporters said that Bidault adopted this attitude because the US delegation – whose opinions are law for the French Minister of Foreign Affairs – decided to reject the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Some reporters pointed out that Bidault's position may weaken the already unstable position of the French government.
    Observers believe that the French delegation's adoption of this attitude is due to the fact that, under the current circumstances, Bidault is trying to play tricks, trying to avoid losing the favor of the US State Department on the one hand, and on the other hand, to somewhat alleviate the growing dissatisfaction caused by his attitude among the broadest French public.
    The correspondents concluded by expressing their belief that the proponents of the "position of strength" policy will not succeed in belittling the importance of the proposals made by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    France
    Pham Van Dong's constructive proposals based on the reality of the situation in Indochina immediately became the focus of heated discussion in French public opinion. "Liberation" said on the 11th that this proposal meant that "peace in Indochina is possible; Ho Chi Minh's recent talks indicate a desire to negotiate with France… If Laniel and Bidault wish it, the Geneva negotiations can make good progress quickly. This requires the (French) parliament to use all methods to guide them in this direction." "L'Intransigeant" pointed out that "many seats in the French parliament oppose Bidault's rejection of the moving Viet Minh (referring to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) plan." At the French National Assembly on the 11th, some members spoke out, demanding that the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for resolving the Indochina issue be accepted as "the basis for negotiations."
    "L'Humanité" reported that the Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué saying that these proposals "reflect the unwavering will of the Ho Chi Minh government to seek peace, and it lays a good foundation for consultation." The committee called on all working people in France to write letters, send telegrams, and submit petitions to the government and Minister of Foreign Affairs Bidault, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Indochina.
    The leading body of the French Women's Union also passed a similar resolution, emphasizing that negotiations on the Indochina issue should be based on the proposals made by Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    "L'Humanité" said that women's delegations from the Paris region and workers' representatives from the Marseilles Plain have gone to Geneva to convey to the French delegation the French people's desire for an immediate ceasefire in Indochina.
    However, this proposal has plunged the French delegation attending the Geneva Conference into confusion. The French delegation, which rashly rejected Pham Van Dong's proposal on the 10th following the US, changed its tone at a press conference on the 11th after seeing that this obstructionist attitude towards the Geneva Conference was strongly opposed in France. They said that the French delegation had not rejected Pham Van Dong's proposal, and that this proposal could "serve as a basis for discussion." However, the French spokesman also said that their "initial impression" of this proposal "remained unchanged." This shows that the French delegation still wants to follow the US and has no sincerity in seriously negotiating the restoration of peace in Indochina. In contrast to Pham Van Dong's realistic and constructive proposals, Bidault's original proposals, which did not conform to the reality of the situation in Indochina and were based on colonialist ideas, appeared even more to be obstacles to the progress of the conference. French News Agency correspondent Ellery in Geneva said on the 11th that Bidault's response to Pham Van Dong's proposals "seems to be a difficult task."
    India
    Pham Van Dong's proposals aroused widespread sympathy in Indian public opinion. The "Hindustan Times" said on the 11th: "The first impression created by the unexpectedly moderate statement and proposals of the chief representative of the Viet Minh delegation is that they may give the (Geneva) Conference a completely new face, and if the French government rejects the Viet Minh's proposals outright, it will cause a serious error."
    The "Hindustan Times" published a report by its Geneva correspondent on the 12th saying: "If people are still prepared to negotiate with the Viet Minh – and everyone knows that this is unavoidable if the war is to be avoided – they cannot deny that these proposals (put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) provide a realistic basis for discussion."
    The "Hindustan Times" pointed out in an editorial on the same day that Pham Van Dong's announcement at the conference on the 10th that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was willing to allow the removal of seriously wounded personnel from the French Expeditionary Force from Dien Bien Phu "must create a more favorable atmosphere for the hopeful development of negotiations."
    The "Hindustan Times" said in the previous few days that if France more realistically recognizes its situation in Indochina, it will greatly help the conference to reach a solution.
    The "Times of India" published a report from Geneva by its reporter, Der R. Mankekar, on the 12th. He wrote: "Most of the French journalists I have spoken to believe that the Viet Minh's proposals are a fair and reasonable basis for holding negotiations. But the Laniel government stubbornly – probably under pressure from Washington – refuses to make any concessions to the Viet Minh, although it is very afraid of the anger of the French people. Therefore, Paris is currently playing tricks, trying to deceive (French) the National Assembly and public opinion, in order to overcome the current crisis."
    The "Times of India" published an editorial on the same day saying: "The Viet Minh's plan at least provides a basis for discussion. Since the purpose of the discussions currently underway in Geneva is to promote peace and the independence of Southeast Asia, the Viet Minh's demand that France explicitly recognize the 'sovereignty and independence' of the three Indochinese countries cannot be opposed. There can be no exception to the proposition of a comprehensive withdrawal of all foreign troops." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 各国舆论重视范文同的八点建议

    各国舆论重视范文同的八点建议
    苏联
    “真理报”驻日内瓦特派记者茹科夫、普利歇夫斯基和拉萨金十二日在一篇题为“恢复印度支那和平的切实可行的计划”的通讯中写道：越南民主共和国代表团于五月十日提出的和平解决印度支那问题的计划，对争端的实质问题的讨论提供了现实的基础。
    记者指出：由于越南民主共和国代表团于五月十日采取了具有巨大道义力量的十分人道的步骤，主张立刻达成协议运走奠边府的所有重伤法军（不问其属于何国籍），这个计划就给人更加深刻的印象。
    在这方面记者指出，越南民主共和国代表团的倡议使得上述问题有可能得到解决。
    记者进一步评论越南民主共和国代表团发言人黄文欢在五月十日举行的记者招待会。“真理报”记者写道：越南民主共和国代表团提出的八点和平计划引起了巨大的兴趣。日内瓦的外国记者指出，越南民主共和国代表团已经提出了一个关于停止敌对行动的合情合理的计划，假如法国代表团是根据他们国家的民族利益行事，而不是根据美国国务院的“意见”行事的话，这个计划是完全能使法国满意的。
    在记者招待会后，记者们得到了越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同的发言全文。“真理报”记者援引法国代表团发言人贝延斯的话说，皮杜尔甚至认为不能接受范文同的建议作为谈判的基础。
    记者写道：消息灵通的记者说，皮杜尔所以采取这样的态度是由于美国代表团——他们的意见对法国外交部部长说来就是法律——决定拒绝越南民主共和国的建议。
    某些记者指出，皮杜尔的立场可能削弱法国政府的已经不稳的地位。
    观察家认为：法国代表团之所以采取这种态度是由于在目前的情况下，皮杜尔竭力想玩弄花样，想一方面不失去美国国务院的恩宠，另一方面又多少缓和一下他的态度在最广泛的法国公众之间所引起的越来越大的不满。
    记者最后表示，他们相信“实力地位”政策的奉行者想要贬低越南民主共和国代表团所提建议的重要性是不会成功的。
    法国
    范文同根据印度支那现实局势提出的建设性的建议，立即成为法国舆论热烈讨论的焦点。“解放报”十一日说，这个建议意味着印度支那获致“和平是可能的，最近胡志明的谈话表示希望要与法国进行谈判。……如果拉尼埃和皮杜尔希望的话，日内瓦的谈判可以很快获得良好的进展。这需要（法国）议会使用一切方法来导使他们朝这方向走。”“义勇军报”指出，法国“议会里许多席位上的人都反对皮杜尔拒绝动人的越盟（指越南民主共和国）计划”。在十一日举行的法国国民议会上，就有议员发言要求接受越南民主共和国的解决印度支那问题的建议作为“谈判的基础”。
    “人道报”报道，法国总工会行政委员会发表公报说，这些建议“反映了胡志明政府要求和平的不屈不挠的意志，它为协商奠定了良好的基础”。委员会号召法国所有的劳动人民向政府和外交部部长皮杜尔写信、打电报、上请愿书，要求立刻在印度支那停火。
    法兰西妇女联盟的领导机构也通过类似的决议，强调指出关于印度支那问题的谈判，应以越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同提出的建议为基础。
      “人道报”说，巴黎区的妇女代表团以及马赛平原区的工人代表们，已经前往日内瓦向法国代表团转达法国人民要求立刻在印度支那停火的意见。
    然而，这个建议却使出席日内瓦会议的法国代表团陷于混乱。跟在美国后面在十日轻率地拒绝了范文同建议的法国代表团，看到他们这种阻挠日内瓦会议的态度在法国国内遭到强烈反对以后，十一日在记者招待会上改变了腔调，说法国代表团并没有拒绝范文同的建议，说这个建议可以“作为讨论的基础”。但是，法国发言人同时又表示他们对这个建议的“最初的印象还是未变”。这说明法国代表团依然想跟美国走，没有认真协商恢复印度支那和平的诚意。在范文同提出实事求是的建设性建议的对照下，皮杜尔原来提出的丝毫不符合印度支那现实局势的，并且是以殖民主义观念作为基础的建议，已更加显得只是给会议进展制造的障碍。法国新闻社驻日内瓦记者艾勒里十一日说，皮杜尔要答复范文同的建议，“看来大概是一项艰难的工作”。
      印度
    范文同的建议在印度舆论中引起广泛的同情。“印度斯坦时报”十一日说：“越盟代表团首席代表的意外温和的发言和建议所造成的第一个印象是，它们可能给（日内瓦）会议一个全新的面貌，如果法国政府直截了当地拒绝越盟的建议，它将造成一个严重的错误。”
      “印度斯坦时报”十二日登载该报驻日内瓦记者的报道说：“如果人们还准备和越盟进行谈判——大家知道，如果要避免战争继续下去，这是不可避免的——他们就不能否认（越南民主共和国提出的）这些建议为讨论提供了现实的基础。”
      “印度斯坦时报”在同一天发表社论指出，范文同在日内瓦会议十日会议上的发言中，一开头就宣布越南民主共和国愿意允许自奠边府运走法国远征军的重伤人员，这“必然为谈判的有希望的发展创造更有利的气氛”。
      “印度斯坦时报”在前几天并说，如果法国更现实地认识到它在印度支那的处境，那将大大有助于会议获得解决办法。
      “印度时报”十二日刊载了该报记者德·鲁·曼克卡尔自日内瓦发出的报道。他写道：“和我谈过话的大多数法国记者都认为，越盟的建议是举行谈判的公平合理的基础。但是拉尼埃政府顽固地——大概是在华盛顿的压力下——拒绝对越盟作任何让步，虽然它十分害怕法国人民的愤怒。因此，巴黎目前正在玩弄花样，想蒙蔽（法国）国民议会和舆论，以渡过眼前的危机。”
    “印度时报”同一天发表社论说：“越盟的计划至少提供了进行讨论的基础。由于目前在日内瓦进行的讨论目的在于促进和平与东南亚的独立，因此越盟要求法国明确地承认三个印度支那国家的‘主权与独立’，这个主张是不能加以反对的。在全面撤退所有外国军队的主张上不能例外地也是如此。”　（新华社）
