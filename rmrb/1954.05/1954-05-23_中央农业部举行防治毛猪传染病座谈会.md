    Central Ministry of Agriculture Holds Symposium on Preventing Hog Infectious Diseases
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government held a symposium on the prevention and control of infectious diseases in hogs from May 10th to 15th, in order to ensure the development of hog production. Participants included veterinary administrative cadres from major regions and five key provinces (Hebei, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hunan, and Henan), as well as researchers studying swine diseases from the Central Veterinary Biological Products Inspection Institute, the Northeast Veterinary Science Research Institute, and the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and personnel responsible for hog quarantine. Representatives from the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Railways, the China Food Company, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and the Fourth Office of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council were also invited to participate. Soviet advisors and Soviet veterinary experts from the Ministry of Agriculture also attended the meeting and provided guidance.
    According to reports from various regions, diseases such as hog cholera, swine erysipelas, and swine fever are widespread. The meeting concluded that the main reason for the epidemic is that the prevention and control of infectious diseases in hogs is not thorough and widespread enough in various regions. In the past, the leadership of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture focused on the prevention and control of infectious diseases in draught animals, while neglecting hog infectious diseases, resulting in a laissez-faire state of work in preventing and controlling pig diseases. Sanitary and epidemic prevention work was not done well during the purchase and transportation of pigs, which spread hog infectious diseases. After detailed discussions, preliminary opinions have been put forward to actively strengthen the prevention and control of hog infectious diseases, and operational procedures for preventive injections have been drafted, ready to be issued to grassroots cadres for study and implementation, to improve injection techniques.

    中央农业部举行防治毛猪传染病座谈会
    中央人民政府农业部为了保证发展毛猪生产，于五月十日到十五日举行了防治毛猪传染病座谈会。参加座谈会的有各大区及河北、江苏、四川、湖南、河南等五个重点省的兽医行政干部，还有中央兽医生物药品监察所、东北兽医科学研究所、华东农业科学研究所等研究机关的研究猪病人员及负责毛猪检疫人员。并邀请了中央对外贸易部、卫生部、铁道部、中国食品公司、全国合作总社及政务院财政经济委员会第四办公厅派员参加。农业部苏联顾问和苏联兽医专家也参加会议并作了指导。
    据各地汇报材料，猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫等病流行甚广。会议认为疫病流行的主要原因，是各地防治毛猪传染病工作不够深入和普遍，过去中央农业部畜牧兽医总局领导思想上，抓紧了役畜传染病的防治，放松了毛猪传染病，造成防治猪病工作的自流状态。收购、运输猪只时也未做好卫生防疫工作，散布了毛猪传染病。经过详细讨论后，已初步提出积极加强防治毛猪传染病的意见，并拟定了预防注射操作规程，准备发给各地基层干部学习执行，以提高注射技术。（敏苇）
