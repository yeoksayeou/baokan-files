The East China Administrative Committee's Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau recently convened a regional conference on flood and drought prevention to preliminarily summarize the winter and spring farmland water conservancy work and to study and deploy flood and drought prevention work for the entire region. The conference determined that this year's flood and drought prevention work is: while ensuring the smooth completion of agricultural production plans, efforts should be made to ensure that the sea dikes of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, as well as major rivers, do not collapse and cause disasters, and that general rivers and sea dikes do not breach under the current guaranteed water levels and wind force, and to do everything possible to avoid or reduce possible droughts and floods. The conference also made specific arrangements for this year's flood and drought prevention work: (1) Flood and drought prevention organizations in all provinces and cities should be established before June 1st to fully prepare ideologically and organizationally. (2) Quickly organize forces to conduct a systematic and in-depth inspection, including inspections of the establishment of flood and drought prevention organizations, hidden dangers in projects and dangerous construction sections, and the preparation of flood control materials, to promptly identify problems and quickly resolve them. (3) For dangerous construction sections of important rivers that are prone to disasters, or areas preparing for flood storage and detention, thorough research should be conducted, through on-site investigations and scientific calculations, and temporary measures should be planned as early as possible, so that when encountering extraordinary floods, disaster areas can be reduced in a planned manner. For those areas that have historically had water conservancy disputes between upstream and downstream, the masses should be educated before the flood season to promote the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual concession, and consideration of the overall situation, and to resolve issues through consultation. (4) Combine flood prevention inspections with drought prevention preparations. For areas prone to drought, emphasis should be placed on water storage, water conservation, and rational water use. The masses should be widely mobilized to repair existing ponds, dams, ditches, and wells, and to store rainwater, river water, and lake water as much as possible, to maximize the water storage, water supply, and water conveyance efficiency of existing projects. (5) Strengthen forecasting work and establish a reporting system. In flood and drought prevention work, it is necessary to maintain close contact with meteorological departments and do a good job in forecasting. (6) Prepare necessary materials and make material preparations. In areas prone to dangerous situations and inconvenient transportation, materials should be raised in advance and properly stored.

    华东区布置防汛防旱工作
    华东行政委员会农林水利局最近召开全区防汛防旱工作会议，初步总结了冬春修农田水利工作，研究和布置了全区防汛防旱工作。会议确定今年的防汛防旱工作是：在保障农业生产计划顺利完成的任务下，努力保证江苏、浙江、上海海塘和大江大河不溃决成灾，一般河流、海堤在目前保证水位和保证风力下不决口，并尽一切可能避免或缩小可能发生的旱灾与涝灾。会议上并对今年防汛防旱工作作了具体布置：（一）各省市防汛防旱机构应在六月一日前建立，以充分做好思想上和组织上的各项准备。（二）迅速组织力量，进行一次有系统的、深入的检查工作，对防汛防旱组织建立的情况，工程隐患和险工地段，防汛器材的准备等方面都进行检查，及时发现问题，迅予解决。（三）对灾害频繁的重要河流的险工地段，或准备蓄洪滞洪的地区，均应缜密研究，经过实地调查，科学的计算，及早做出临时措施计划，以便遇到非常洪水时，有计划地缩小灾区。对于那些历来有上下游水利纠纷的地区，应在汛前向群众进行教育，本互助互让照顾整体的精神，协商解决。（四）结合防汛检查做好防旱准备工作，对于易受旱灾地区要强调做好蓄水、保水与合理用水工作，要普遍发动群众整修现有的塘坝、沟渠、水井，尽量蓄积雨水、河水和湖水，以发挥现有工程的蓄水供水输水的效能。（五）加强预报工作，建立汇报制度。在防汛防旱工作中必须要与气象部门密切联系，做好预报工作。（六）准备必需器材，做好物质准备，在容易发生险工和交通不便的地段，更要事先筹集器材，妥为保管。
