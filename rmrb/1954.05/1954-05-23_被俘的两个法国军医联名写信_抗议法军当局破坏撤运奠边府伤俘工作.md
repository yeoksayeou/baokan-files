Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd dispatch: The plot of the French military high command to sabotage the evacuation of wounded and captured French soldiers from Dien Bien Phu has aroused the indignation of French prisoners of war and medical personnel. French Major Doctor Grovins and Captain Doctor Radamany, who were captured by the Vietnamese People's Army in Dien Bien Phu, jointly wrote a letter to the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Force in Indochina to protest. Before Dien Bien Phu was liberated, these two military doctors were responsible for caring for the wounded in Dien Bien Phu. Now, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army has allowed them to continue caring for the wounded and captured.

The letter from the two military doctors stated: The seriously wounded personnel of the French Expeditionary Force in Dien Bien Phu must be evacuated immediately. Vietnamese surgical teams, similar to our surgical medical teams, are doing their best to treat our wounded.

We firmly protest against the French military high command's disregard for the goodwill arrangements made by President Ho Chi Minh. Further prolonging the suffering of our wounded is inhumane.

We were astonished to learn that on May 16, not a single doctor accompanied the French delegation to Dien Bien Phu. The French wounded and captured, and ourselves, were even more astonished to learn that one of the proposals put forward by the French military high command had nothing to do with the evacuation of the wounded and captured, namely the so-called organization of a mixed commission with neutral countries participating to supervise the traffic of Vietnamese People's Army transport vehicles (on Highway 41 – Vietnam News Agency note).

The joint letter finally requested that all possible means be used to accelerate the evacuation of seriously wounded prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu, and that the issue of evacuating the wounded no longer be subordinated to strategic and military considerations.

    被俘的两个法国军医联名写信
    抗议法军当局破坏撤运奠边府伤俘工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】越南通讯社二十一日讯：法军总司令部破坏撤运奠边府法军伤俘工作的阴谋引起了法军战俘和医务工作人员的愤慨。在奠边府被越南人民军俘掳的法军少校军医格罗温和上尉军医拉达马尼联名写信，向印度支那法国远征军总司令部表示抗议。在奠边府被解放以前，这两位军医在奠边府负责照顾伤员；现在，越南人民军总司令部准许他们继续照顾伤俘。
    这两位军医的信说：必须立即撤运奠边府法国远征军重伤人员。类似我们的外科医疗队的越南外科手术队正在尽力医治我们的伤员。
    我们坚决抗议法军总司令部不考虑胡志明主席所作的好意的安排。再进一步延长我们的伤员所受的痛苦是不人道的。
    我们不胜惊异地得悉，五月十六日没有一个医生随着法军代表团到奠边府来。法军伤俘和我们自己更加惊异地得悉，法军总司令部所提出的建议中有一项和撤运伤俘毫不相干，这就是所谓组织有中立国参与的混合委员会来监督越南人民军的运输车辆的来往（在第四十一号公路上——越南通讯社注）。
    联名信最后要求用各种可能的方法来加速奠边府重伤战俘的撤运工作，不再使撤运伤俘问题从属于策略和军事考虑。
