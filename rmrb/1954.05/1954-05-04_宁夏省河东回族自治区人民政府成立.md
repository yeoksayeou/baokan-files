Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 3rd: The first People's Representative Congress of the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region in Ningxia Province was held in Wuzhong City from April 14th to 20th, and the People's Government of the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region in Ningxia Province was officially established. The People's Representative Congress of the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region was convened on the basis of universal suffrage. A total of 116 representatives of the Hui and Han people attended the congress. At the meeting, Ma Teng'ai (Hui nationality) was elected as the chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Xue Chiyun (Han nationality) and Jin Sanshou (Hui nationality) were elected as vice-chairmen, and Han Xiaozhong, Wang Hongkui and 22 others were elected as members. The conference also determined this year's work tasks for the autonomous region based on the country's general task during the transition period and the specific conditions of the autonomous region, focusing on the development of agricultural production, while also developing animal husbandry production and carrying out other construction. The conference requested that all parts of the autonomous region increase grain production by 29 million catties this year; the number of organized farmers should reach more than 51% of the total number of farmers.

During the conference, Sun Diancai, member of the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, and Zhang Jie, Secretary-General of the China Islamic Association, came to the conference to congratulate. The conference also received banners from the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Northwest Administrative Committee, the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, and various fraternal ethnic autonomous regions. The conference also passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.

The Hedong Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia Province is located east of the Yellow River within the province, and governs Wuzhong City and the three counties of Jinji, Lingwu, and Tongxin. It is an autonomous region equivalent to a special zone. Except for Tongxin County, which is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area, Wuzhong, Jinji, and Lingwu are all areas with well-developed water conservancy. The territory has a population of more than 230,000 people, including Hui, Han and other ethnic groups, of which the Hui population accounts for 62%. The entire region has an average of nearly six acres of paddy fields and dry land per person, and farmers of all ethnic groups mainly grow rice. The production of wheat, millet, sorghum, fur, licorice, white sesame, hair vegetables and other agricultural and animal products and various local specialties are very abundant. The Tan sheep lambskin produced in the autonomous region is a special product that is famous throughout the country.

In recent years, under the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region have united closely and developed production. In agricultural production last year, many patriotic production increase models emerged, such as the Ma Yide mutual aid group jointly formed by Hui and Han farmers, whose yield per mu of high-yield rice field reached 1,484 catties last year. At present, there are more than 3,860 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the region, and the number of organized farmers accounts for 46% of the total number of farmers. The cultivated area of the autonomous region has also gradually expanded, and the area of ​​newly added paddy fields in the region last year was about 120,000 mu. The unit area yield of crops in Wuzhong, Jinji, and Lingwu last year increased by 75.5% compared with the time of liberation. Livestock production has also increased year by year. In order to help farmers of all ethnic groups develop production, the People's Government has established a state-owned mechanized farm in the autonomous region, and is preparing to establish another one recently. With the development of production, the people's living standards in the autonomous region have been greatly improved. The living conditions of "half a year of bran and vegetables and half a year of grain" among the people before liberation have now passed. The autonomous region has 130 middle and primary schools, and the number of students has increased by about two times compared with before liberation. The population of the autonomous region is also growing rapidly. According to the population survey results of the entire region, the population of Tongxin and Lingwu counties in 1953 increased by 68.3% compared with the early days of liberation, about 52,000 people. Among these increased population, in addition to more than 29,000 people who were poor farmers who were captured by the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Hongkui bandits to serve as soldiers or were forced to flee their homes due to the conscription, the rest were newborn babies. In terms of training ethnic minority cadres, great achievements have also been made in recent years. At present, there are more than 520 Hui cadres in the entire region, of which more than 30 are leading cadres at the level of county magistrate, mayor, and section chief. The growth of ethnic minority cadres has created favorable conditions for the establishment and future development of the autonomous region.

    宁夏省河东回族自治区人民政府成立
    【新华社银川三日电】宁夏省河东回族自治区四月十四日到二十日在吴忠市召开首届人民代表大会，正式成立了宁夏省河东回族自治区人民政府。河东回族自治区人民代表大会是在普选基础上召开的。出席这次大会的有回、汉族人民代表共一百一十六人。会上选出马腾霭（回族）为自治区人民政府主席，薛池云（汉族）、金三寿（回族）为副主席，韩孝忠、王洪魁等二十二人为委员。大会并根据国家过渡时期总任务和自治区的具体情况，确定了自治区今年的工作任务以发展农业生产为主，同时发展畜牧业生产和进行其他建设。大会要求自治区各地在今年增产粮食二千九百万斤；组织起来的农户应达到总农户的百分之五十一以上。
    大会期间，中国共产党宁夏省委员会委员、宁夏省人民政府副主席孙殿才，中国伊斯兰教协会秘书长张杰都到大会祝贺。大会还收到中央人民政府民族事务委员会、中共中央西北局、西北行政委员会、中国共产党宁夏省委员会、宁夏省人民政府和各兄弟民族自治区致送的锦旗等。大会并通过了向毛主席的致敬电。
    宁夏省河东回族自治区在省内黄河以东，辖吴忠市和金积、灵武、同心三个县，是相当于专区级的自治区。自治区除同心县是半农半牧区外，吴忠、金积、灵武等三市、县都是水利很发达的地区。境内人口有二十三万多人，包括回、汉等民族，其中回族人口占百分之六十二。全区每人平均有近六亩水田和旱地，各族农民以种植水稻为主。出产的小麦、糜、谷、皮毛、甘草、白麻、发菜等农产品、畜产品和各种土特产品都很丰富，自治区出产的滩羊羔裘是驰名全国的特产品。
    几年来，自治区各族人民在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，亲密团结，发展生产。在农业生产中去年并涌现了许多爱国增产模范，其中如回、汉族农民联合组成的马义德互助组，去年每亩水稻丰产田产量高达一千四百八十四斤。现在全区有农业生产合作社和互助组三千八百六十多个，已组织起来的农户占农户总数的百分之四十六。自治区耕地面积也逐渐扩大，去年全区增加的水田约有十二万亩。吴忠、金积、灵武三市、县去年农作物单位面积产量比解放时增加百分之七十五点五。牲畜产量也逐年有所增多。为帮助各族农民发展生产，人民政府在自治区已建立了一个国营机耕农场，最近还准备再建立一个。随着生产的发展，自治区人民生活已得到很大改善，解放前人民中“半年糠菜半年粮”的生活景况，现在已过去了。自治区现有中、小学一百三十所，学生人数比解放前约增加了两倍。自治区人口也在迅速增长中。根据全区人口调查结果，一九五三年同心、灵武两县人口比解放初期增加了百分之六十八点三，约五万二千多人。这些增加的人口中，除有二万九千多人是过去被蒋介石、马鸿逵匪帮抓去当兵或因抓兵被迫逃离家乡的贫苦农民外，其余都是新生的婴儿。在培养民族干部方面，几年来也有很大成绩。现在全区已有五百二十多名回族干部，其中担任县长、市长和科长级的领导干部就有三十多名。民族干部的成长对自治区的建立和今后的发展，创造了有利条件。
