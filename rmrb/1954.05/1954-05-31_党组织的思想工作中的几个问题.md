Editor's Note: The issues discussed in this article concerning the roles of the people and individuals in history, the worker-peasant alliance, and dogmatism are precisely the problems existing in the ideological work of our Party organizations. The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party points out that some cadres within our Party exaggerate the role of individuals and do not strictly adhere to the principle of collective leadership, precisely because they have a mistaken understanding of the roles of the people and individuals in history. The article points out that "in newspaper coverage, radio broadcasts, all propaganda work, political, scientific, and artistic works, on the theater stage, and in art films, the role of the people and the role of the Communist Party have been explained very little, and in a tasteless and sometimes even wrong way until recently." This phenomenon is not absent in our country, but is even more serious. Propaganda work concerning the worker-peasant alliance and the unity of all nationalities is also poorly done by us. Although dogmatism in theoretical work and theoretical study is frequently opposed, it has not disappeared. Therefore, this article is worth studying by us.

For more than fifty years, the Soviet Communist Party, guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, has formulated its policies on the basis of scientific knowledge of the laws of social development, and in implementing these policies, it has relied on the people and the worker-peasant alliance.

Ideological work is a powerful weapon for the Party in its revolutionary transformation activities. Its mission is to educate the working people with communist ideas and inspire them to achieve new successes in our country's communist construction. Political education work does not allow for abstraction, pedantic discussion, and bookish habits; it cannot be "shooting without a target," and it is not an end in itself. All ideological work of the Party organizations should serve the smooth completion of the tasks facing the country.

The 19th Party Congress pointed out that many Party organizations underestimated ideological work, and that ideological work lagged behind the actual tasks of the Party and the state. Since the 19th Congress of the CPSU, Party organizations at all levels have done some work in raising the ideological and theoretical level of Party and state cadres. They have paid more attention to mass political work, explaining the domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government to the working people more profoundly and substantively.

Party organizations at all levels have launched a massive effort to explain the resolutions of the September and February-March Plenary Sessions of the CPSU Central Committee to the working people. During the preparation for and conduct of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, political mobilization work among workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals has reached a vast scale. Provincial committees, regional committees, and central committees of the union republics have transferred and are transferring a large number of Party activists from the cities to help the rural Soviet Communist Party district committees carry out political work in rural areas.

The Party's measures to improve all ideological work have undoubtedly produced good results. This has also promoted the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Party, to achieve new and great successes in economic and cultural construction. This is not to say that the instructions of the 19th Party Congress on ideological work have been fully implemented. The detachment of the ideological work of Party organizations from practical life and from the great tasks that the Soviet people are currently solving under the leadership of the Communist Party remains a major shortcoming in this regard. Propaganda and agitation should not stand idly by the meticulous organizational work carried out by local Party organizations in implementing the resolutions of the Party and the government.

In the practical activities of individual Party committees, the phenomenon of underestimating ideological work has also been exposed. This was demonstrated by some Party congresses held not long ago. At these meetings, the issue of ideological work did not receive due reflection.

The resolutions of the Party and the government have formulated a detailed program for the struggle to drastically increase agriculture and various industrial sectors that directly serve the consumption of the people. All these resolutions mark a new stage in the development of the Soviet socialist economy. The realization of these urgent and important tasks will have an outstanding significance in the history of the Soviet people's struggle to build a communist society in the Soviet Union.

It goes without saying that the successful solution of these pressing and important tasks requires further enhancing the creative initiative and perseverance of our people, guiding them to utilize the huge potential and reserves in industry and agriculture, and eliminating the shortcomings that have existed and still exist in ideological work.

Regarding the roles of the people and individuals in history, in recent years there have been deviations from Marxist-Leninist viewpoints in ideological work, especially in written and oral propaganda. This issue has long been resolved in Marxist-Leninist literature and in the works of the Marxist-Leninist classical writers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. However, our propaganda work does not correctly explain the role of the Communist Party as the true leading force in communist construction, often placing excessive emphasis on the cult of personality, thus distorting Marxism.

From the viewpoint of Marxist-Leninist science, social history is the history of the people, that is, the history of the producers of material and cultural wealth who constantly promote society along the path of progress. The people are the creators of history and the masters of history. It is the people who play a decisive role not only in the process of social production but also in all historical events. From ancient times to the present, vivid historical facts have irrefutably proved this point.

This unshakable Marxist principle does not diminish the very important role of some outstanding historical figures, who are good at correctly understanding the conditions of social development and the ways of its positive change, and who are good at correctly representing in their worldview the needs of the advanced class at a certain stage in the historical development process. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are the recognized great leaders of the working class. Their revolutionary activities for the defense of the interests of the broadest strata of the people are recognized by the people, highly praised by the people, and affirmed by the objective process of human history. The names of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are immortal in the people and in history.

Our Party has emphasized in its resolutions more than once the harm of the cult of personality, pointing out that it is necessary to correctly explain the roles of the masses, the Party, and individuals in history. In 1938, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out in the "Resolution on How to Conduct Party Propaganda Work Due to the Publication of the 'Concise History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'" that one of the manifestations of vulgarization and simplification is that "certain pseudo-theorists and propagandists explain the anti-Marxist viewpoint of the role of individuals in history from a semi-'Social Revolutionary' Party standpoint."

Workers on the ideological front have forgotten this instruction of the Party. In newspaper coverage, radio broadcasts, all propaganda and agitation work, political, scientific, and artistic works, on the theater stage, and in art films, the role of the people and the role of the Communist Party have been explained very little, and in a tasteless and sometimes even wrong way until recently. As long as one rolls to the side of the cult of personality in theory and practice, it will reduce the significance of the policy of building a communist society formulated by the Party over many years, reduce the creative initiative of the masses, create distrust of the people's power, and inevitably lead the masses to passivity.

In propaganda work, especially in the Party's education system, the subjective faults in evaluating historical events have not yet been overcome, and there is still a phenomenon of clearly underestimating the study of the resolutions of Party congresses, representative conferences, and plenary sessions of the CPSU Central Committee. Everyone knows that on all the most important principled issues in domestic life and international events, the Party makes resolutions as a collective, as the political leader of the Soviet people and their guiding and leading force. The recently published collection of "Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Representative Conferences, and Central Plenary Sessions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" is a very important must-read document for studying the history and policies of the Soviet Communist Party.

The issue of the cult of personality has not only theoretical significance but also political and practical significance. The cult of personality is contradictory to the principle of collective leadership, it hinders the development of criticism and self-criticism, and it brings serious harm to the leadership of the Party's work, the country's economic work, and cultural work. Practice shows that decisions made by individuals without the support of collective opinions are often one-sided and wrong.

Ensuring the supreme principle of the Party's leadership, that is, ensuring collectivism from bottom to top in Party organizations at all levels and in elected Soviet organizations and social organizations at all levels—this is what the Party calls upon us to do. However, collective leadership does not preclude individual accountability for the undertakings entrusted to the Party. Once a resolution embodying collective experience has been adopted, every worker must unswervingly implement it and be responsible for its realization.

The Central Committee relies on the scientific basis of Marxist-Leninist theory and on the broad initiative of the people and leading cadres; only its collective experience and collective wisdom can guarantee the correctness of leading the Party and the country, guarantee the unbreakable unity and solidarity of the Party's ranks, and guarantee the victory of our country's communist construction. The CPSU Central Committee resolutely abides by the norms of Party life formulated by the great creator of our Party, Lenin, and strives to ensure that Party organizations at all levels increasingly strictly implement the principle of collective leadership. The recent plenary sessions of the CPSU Central Committee convincingly demonstrate this point, and the resolutions of these plenary sessions are the expression of the Party's collective experience. The All-Union Conference of Machine Tractor Station Workers and the Conference of Soviet State Farm Workers and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic Agricultural Advanced Workers' Conference held by the CPSU Central Committee and the government in the Kremlin also illustrate this point. In the discussion of agricultural issues and in the resolutions adopted, the collective opinions of the people participating in these plenary sessions and conferences are vividly expressed, reflecting the true state of affairs and the collective experience and initiative of agricultural workers.

As early as in the pre-revolutionary years, Lenin called our Party's Central Committee a "collective of leaders." This accurate definition of Lenin's is now profoundly and comprehensively expressed in the activities of the CPSU Central Committee, in its style of work, and in its leadership style. The collective leadership of the Party and its local organs produces good results, and new achievements are being made in the development of our national economy and culture. The people regard the resolutions of the Party and its Central Committee and the Soviet government as their own cause, and their enthusiasm is embodied in the growth of vivid creative initiative, in labor, in state activities, and in the entire life of socialist society.

The Soviet people make our motherland more glorious and prosperous. They are actually fulfilling the historical mission of the creators of communist society, and they play a major decisive role in the continued progress of Soviet society along the path planned by our Party. Therefore, a fundamental transformation of the Party organizations' mass mobilization work and propaganda work is of great significance.

If the mass political work of the Party organizations is carried out correctly, it will help to develop the creative initiative of the working people. The masses raise new and urgent problems and make various suggestions, which provide many new possibilities for promoting our smooth progress, increasing labor productivity, and launching new large-scale creative labor competitions. Practical life now especially urgently requires Party workers to abandon clumsy working methods—being busy with meetings, drafting unnecessary "instructions," collecting reports, and so on. Go more and more often to the masses of the people; carefully listen to their demands, suggestions, and experiences; and not only subjectivate those activists who attend all the meetings of all sizes, but also subjectivate ordinary Soviet people. It is intolerable to carry out mass political work infrequently and in a campaign style, because the result of this will be to weaken the attention of Party organizations, propagandists, and mobilizers to the work of residents after each campaign. It is also intolerable that political work in some production teams is not well done after the merger of collective farms. In some districts, the resolutions of the two recent plenary sessions of the CPSU Central Committee have not yet been communicated to every collective farmer, state farm, and agricultural machinery station worker.

Special attention should be paid to extensively and regularly publicizing scientific achievements and the advanced experiences of the best enterprises, collective farms, agricultural machinery stations, production innovators, and advanced producers. And this can only be done when those who advocate the adoption of advanced experience themselves understand the essence of progressive working methods and operating methods. Without the basic knowledge of agricultural production, one cannot smoothly call on people to skillfully lead the economy and apply advanced experience. The Party organs have every possibility to organize propagandists and agitators to study the basic knowledge of agriculture, and they have every possibility to attract skilled experts who are very familiar with the collective farm economy, agricultural technology, and livestock breeding technology to participate in mass work.

For local publishing bureaus, there is currently no more important task than publishing good popular books on agricultural scientific achievements and advanced agricultural experience. Party organizations at all levels must not relax supervision of this work, just as they cannot relax supervision of the activities of book distribution agencies, which, especially in agricultural areas, are sluggish in their work and indifferent to their work. Advanced experience books are piled up in libraries and stacks, not only have they not been sent to collective farms, but they have not even been sent to agricultural machinery stations.

Due to the new and great tasks currently facing the country, the correct and systematic explanation of the role of the people in creating a new social system, the role of the Communist Party as the true leading force and guiding force of communist construction, the role of the Party Central Committee as a unified and solid leading collective and the Party's headquarters, and the ties and solidarity between the Party and the people are of particular importance. Cultivating the people's confidence in their own great creative power is also of special significance.

×××

In theoretical works, in propaganda, in mobilization work, and in artistic works in recent years, the issue of the alliance between the working class and collective farmers has been poorly explained or not explained at all. However, this issue is one of the fundamental issues of the Communist Party's policy, it has always had great practical significance, and it has even greater practical significance under the conditions of the transition from socialism to communism.

Our Party's Central Committee and the Soviet government tirelessly care about the consolidation of the alliance between the working class and collective farmers. Due to the outstanding achievements of the working class in the development of the country's socialist industrialization and in the development of heavy industry, agriculture has been equipped with first-class technology; in the fields of collective farms and state farms, there are currently more than one million tractors (each with 15 horsepower), 270,000 grain harvesters, and many other agricultural machines working. About 100,000 agronomists and livestock breeders and more than 20,000 engineers and technicians have been sent to work in agricultural machinery stations and collective farms. The voluntary help of industrial enterprises to the collective farm countryside has been launched and has a broader and broader scale. Currently, the help of cities, the working class, and intellectuals is of particular importance for strengthening the cultural organs of collective farms.

The task of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is organically linked to the continuous implementation of the principle of the material interests of laborers in our national economy. The Party and the government have recently formulated a number of new measures to ensure the increase of the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of collective farm production. This is one of the most important economic factors for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The principle of material interests is the most important means of ensuring a sharp increase in the production of consumer goods, because it enables the huge unutilized production reserves to play a role.

The successful implementation of the Party and government's resolutions on further improving Soviet agriculture and on producing abundant agricultural products in our country will undoubtedly promote the further consolidation of the alliance between the working class and collective farmers. The more consolidated and stronger this alliance, the more powerful and stronger the country, and the faster the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet working people will improve.

From this, it can be seen how important it is in current ideological work to systematically and profoundly explain the role and significance of the alliance between the working class and collective farmers for our country's communist construction, to clearly explain the Party and government's concern for further developing and consolidating this alliance, and to explain the tasks and responsibilities of workers and collective farmers themselves in consolidating the alliance of the two major friendly classes in our socialist society.

The practice of some propagandists and some thesis writers is incorrect. They separate the issues of Soviet patriotism and the friendship of all nationalities from the issue of the worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of our country's consolidation and the main force for Soviet society to advance towards communism. Only under the conditions of tirelessly caring about the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance can Soviet patriotism and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union be effectively developed. At the same time, this alliance itself can cultivate the feelings of Soviet patriotism and the friendship of all nationalities, which embody the major interests of all the working people of the Soviet Union and the necessity of brotherly mutual assistance among all nationalities of the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is surprising that in the two editions of the "On Soviet Patriotism" thesis collection published by the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, ten authors wrote articles on this topic, but not a single word was mentioned about the worker-peasant alliance.

In our written and oral propaganda, the significance of Soviet patriotism and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union is talked about quite a lot. But these driving forces of Soviet society are often talked about in an abstract and pedantic way. There is a lack of concrete and significant examples to clearly show how great a role these driving forces play in the strong development of our entire national economy and culture. For example, it would be very useful to fully demonstrate with concrete facts and examples the characteristics of Soviet patriotism as the highest type of patriotism, to reveal in essence how the patriotism of the Soviet people is expressed in the daily constructive creative labor of workers, collective farmers, and scientists, in active social activities, in socialist competitions, in various facts of the struggle to increase the material and spiritual wealth of our motherland by increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, reducing product costs, and utilizing new potential and reserves.

Many theses and lectures on the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are written, but they mainly explain this issue from a historical perspective. The concrete and practical effects of Lenin-Stalin's national policy in the development of the economy, culture, and state system of each republic are clearly not explained enough. In the exposition of the historical issues of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, there are still bourgeois nationalist distortions in the works of individual historians and literary researchers.

In socialist society, there is no class foundation for bourgeois ideologies such as nationalism, chauvinism, racial hatred, and national hatred to occupy a dominant position. But everyone knows that the enemies of the Soviet state have tried their best in the past and are now trying to revive the remnants of bourgeois ideology and spread the seeds of distrust and disharmony among all nationalities. As for the struggle against the manifestations of anti-people bourgeois nationalist remnants, it is not carried out thoroughly enough, and a conciliatory attitude is adopted towards the representatives of these remnants in individual cases. The Communist Party does not allow anyone to weaken the unbreakable unity and friendship of the working people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the Party has protected and will continue to protect the unity and friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union like the apple of its eye as the most important condition for advancing to communism.

The friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, the brotherly cooperation of the new socialist nationalities, is a great achievement of the Soviet regime and the result of the implementation of the Communist Party's national policy. The historical experience of the formation and prosperity of the socialist nationalities of the Soviet Union is an example that inspires all nationalities of the world.

×××

One of the major and most common shortcomings in written and oral propaganda is that in many theoretical articles and propaganda essays, in speeches and reports, materials are narrated in a dogmatic and bookish way. Whether it is explaining past events in the history of the Communist Party and the history of our motherland, or whether it is studying and explaining important phenomena in modern life, dogmatism and bookish habits cause great harm to the propaganda cause of Marxism-Leninism, hindering people from correctly understanding what needs to be seriously and deeply scientifically researched and discussed. Dogmatism and bookish habits damage the cause of our cadres creatively understanding the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government and successfully implementing these policies.

The creative nature of Marxism-Leninism requires us to study and apply this great weapon of the Party in a creative way. To understand the essence of Marxist-Leninist theory is to be good at applying it to correctly solve pressing and major problems. To master Marxist-Leninist theory, one must have knowledge of practical life, knowledge of the objective laws of the development of practical life, and the ability to generalize facts, analyze the living phenomena of reality, and thereby draw correct conclusions and apply them to practical activities.

In our ideological work, theoretical problems are often divorced from concrete reality, and there is little connection with the practice of communist construction, and little connection with the tasks of a certain republic, province, region, district, enterprise, collective farm, state farm, and agricultural machinery station. Closely and organically linking propaganda with life and with the practical tasks of the Party and the country is an indispensable condition for eradicating bookish habits and treating theory with a quibbling and pedantic attitude.

Some propagandists often reduce the detailed explanation of the theoretical conclusions of Marxist science to lengthy quotations of famous formulas. The method adopted by such propagandists is to recite well-memorized formulas rather than to persuade and argue.

It goes without saying that criticizing the style of filling up articles with quotations does not mean that quotations are not allowed. The problem is not to eliminate quotations in articles, speeches, or reports. The problem is the kind of obsession with quotations that some propagandists show, which is unreasonable. This obsession with quotations reveals that propagandists are at a loss in the face of the facts of modern life around them, that is, it reveals their pedantry and bookish habits. They treat things lightly, indifferently, and without using their brains, instead of studying and theoretically generalizing the phenomena that occur in real life. Very diligently copying well-memorized original texts, the result is the application of quotations that are clearly outdated in content or that provide little help in explaining the essence of the problem.

Obviously, bookworms feel timid in theory and politics and dare not independently and creatively explain problems. He is afraid of missing something, afraid of missing any quotation from the Marxist-Leninist classics. He acts like a timid ghost: never stir up trouble, never be accused of underestimating or forgetting a certain classic formula. This kind of theoretical timidity of scientific workers is, to some extent, related to the cult of personality, also to not believing in one's own strength, and also to not believing that one can actively participate in clarifying and proposing new issues of Marxist-Leninist theory on the basis of carefully and meticulously studying facts and life phenomena and generalizing the accumulated experience.

It must be pointed out that many editors and reviewers of articles have done propagandists a disservice, thus instilling bookish habits and a style of filling up articles with quotations into propaganda and science. They—still out of a sense of shirking responsibility and theoretical timidity—often remind the author of the article that he "must" add a certain quotation. They delete the author's own statement, even if this statement accurately reflects the meaning of a certain classic principle, just because it is expressed in his own words, or because a word or two is missing in the relevant quotation, or something is added, although this is not a "revision of Marxism."

It often happens that an author's article, which has been revised by an editor in a bookish way, loses its originality, is not novel, has no fresh ideas, and does not raise new questions. Moreover, unfortunately, the situation is often like this: the author is still very satisfied when he sees that his article, which has been revised by a bookworm, is published and has not been thrown into the wastepaper basket.

Among editors, critics, and reviewers of articles, a fairly common phenomenon is that what is criticized is not what is written in the article, but the content of the problem discussed, but what is not in the article. Some reviewers of articles are primarily interested not in what new things the author has written, but in what the author has not mentioned, even if this is not directly related to the problem. Some reviewers of articles believe that everything that is even minimally related to the topic must be clarified in the book or article, even if these problems are not very important and even if not talking about these problems will not harm the entire work.

This is not to say that any article or booklet, no matter what its theoretical level, should be printed. This is not to say that requirements for authors can be lowered. On the contrary, striving to treat theory with a creative attitude must first increase the requirements for the authors of theoretical works.

In order to fight against bookish habits, we should now abandon the obsession with publishing so-called annotative booklets, that is, booklets that rewrite the content of individual Marxist-Leninist classics. It would be much more beneficial to study these works themselves in close connection with the extremely important tasks currently facing our country.

In order to complete the basic political and economic tasks put forward by the Party in ensuring the gradual transition from socialism to communism, the current focus in all ideological work must be on mobilizing the creative forces of the Soviet people, paying attention to unresolved problems, and paying attention to utilizing the inherent reserves and resources that have not yet been fully utilized. Our propagandists and mobilizers, based on the facts they know for sure in the life of a certain republic, region, province, district, enterprise, state farm, collective farm, and agricultural machinery station, have the opportunity to fully explain this point. At the same time, it should be pointed out that many Party committees have not given propagandists and mobilizers the necessary help and have not armed them with concrete materials to carry out purposeful and important propaganda and mobilization.

All our propaganda and mobilization work should be used to solve the following tasks: increase labor productivity in all sectors of communist construction, strictly abide by the system of economy, improve product quality and reduce product costs, strengthen labor discipline, motivate backward enterprises, collective farms, and agricultural machinery stations to reach advanced levels, and in advanced enterprises, collective farms, and agricultural machinery stations, improve existing achievements and make them even better, and maximize the huge potential contained in industry, transportation, and agriculture to continuously improve our country's economy. It is the duty of propagandists and mobilizers to widely explain and carry out the socialist competition of urban and rural laborers. If a propagandist or mobilizer cannot help correct shortcomings and mistakes, if he himself cannot become an organizer of the masses in implementing the resolutions of the Party and the government, then their work cannot be considered valuable. If the Party's propaganda and mobilization can be closely coordinated with concrete organizational work, then their power to influence the masses will be even more significant.

The main goal of all the Party's ideological work is to carry out the communist education of the working people, that is, to cultivate millions of active communist builders so that they can more smoothly implement the Party's policies that represent the fundamental interests of the Soviet people. This is linked to the need to educate the Soviet people in the spirit of vigorous Soviet patriotism, proletarian internationalism, and the indestructible friendship of all nationalities of our country. It is also necessary to fight more stubbornly against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, against the prejudices and traditions of the old society, and against any manifestations of bourgeois nationalism and corrupt bourgeois ideology.

The ideological representatives and political activists of the bourgeoisie are alarmed for their present and terrified for their future. They feel significant unease due to the consolidation of the democratic camp and the weakening of the strength of the imperialist camp. The reasons for these fears and doubts are the increasingly acute economic and political contradictions within the capitalist world, the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, the enhancement of the class consciousness of the working masses in capitalist countries, and their increasing resistance to the capitalist attack on the living standards and democratic rights of residents. The bourgeois leaders are afraid of the powerful mass movement to win peace among all peoples and to oppose the instigators of new wars. The people of capitalist countries and colonial countries are unwilling to live under the iron heel of US imperialism and are fighting for their national independence, and their growing anger makes the ideological representatives and politicians of the United States fear.

Our socialist society is in the period of prosperity of its vital forces and is constantly developing along an upward path. The great superiority of the socialist economic system is increasingly manifested in the continuous growth of the material well-being and cultural level of the entire people and in the selfless struggle of the working people to further improve the national economy. Soviet society bravely exposes and successfully overcomes the shortcomings in its work and the difficulties that arise in the process of socialist construction, and advances towards new victories of communism. The Soviet people look forward to the future with confidence, and they will never feel the kind of fear, panic, and doubt that envelops the bourgeois world. Relying on the great superiority of the Soviet system, our people are strengthening the power of their socialist motherland with their creative labor and holding high the banner of peace and friendship of all nationalities.

Our propaganda and our literature and art should truthfully reflect the great achievements and superiority of the socialist system and reflect the creative activities of Soviet patriots. We should fully demonstrate with vivid and clear examples taken from practical life the role of the Communist Party as the inspiring force, the leading force, and the organizing force of Soviet society, the role of the people as the true creators of history, and the indivisible unity of the Party, the government, and the people.

Before the Party and the Soviet people now lies the solemn task of building a communist society. All our ideological work and all the activities of workers on the ideological front (who bring the great truth, the battle guide—Marxism-Leninism—to the masses) are aimed at achieving this goal.

    党组织的思想工作中的几个问题
    苏联共产党中央宣传鼓动部部长　维·克鲁什科夫  
    编者按：这篇文章所论述的关于人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题、关于工农联盟的问题和关于教条主义的问题，也正是我们党组织思想工作中所存在的问题。中共中央七届四中全会决议指出了我们党内有一部分干部，夸大个人的作用，不严格地遵守集体领导的原则，这正是因为对人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题有错误了解。这篇文章中所指出的，“在报刊篇幅上，在无线电广播中，在一切宣传鼓动工作中，在政治、科学和艺术的著作中，在剧院的舞台上，在艺术影片中，对于人民的作用，对于共产党的作用，直到最近解释得很少，而且解释得无味，有时甚至解释错了”。这种现象在我国不是没有，而是更严重。关于工农联盟和各民族团结的宣传工作，这在我们同样是作得不好的。关于理论工作和理论学习中的教条主义，虽然经常遭到反对，但是并未绝迹。因此这篇文章是值得我们学习的。
    五十多年来，苏联共产党以马克思列宁主义理论为指针，在社会发展法则的科学知识基础上制定自己的政策，并在执行这个政策中依靠人民群众，依靠工农联盟。
    思想工作是党在其革命改造活动中的强有力的武器，它的使命是用共产主义思想来教育劳动人民，鼓舞他们在我国共产主义建设中取得新的成就。政治教育工作不容许有抽象化、烦琐议论和书呆子习气；它不能“无的放矢”，它本身不是目的。党组织的全部思想工作应当服从于顺利完成国家所面临的任务。
    党的第十九次代表大会曾指出，许多党组织对于思想工作估计不足，思想工作落后于党和国家的实际任务。苏共第十九次代表大会以后，各级党组织在提高党和国家干部的思想理论水平方面做了一定的工作。它们更多地注意群众政治工作，更深刻和更有内容地向劳动人民解释共产党和苏联政府的对内和对外政策。
    各级党组织展开了向劳动人民解释苏共中央九月全会和二—三月全会的决议的巨大工作。在准备和进行苏联最高苏维埃选举期间，工人、集体农民和知识分子中间的政治鼓动工作具有了广大的规模。州委会、边疆区委会和加盟共和国党中央从城市中曾抽调了并正在抽调大批党的积极分子去帮助农村苏共区委会开展农村的政治工作。
    党在提高全部思想工作方面的措施，无疑地已产生了良好的效果。这也就促进了苏联人民在党领导下在经济建设和文化建设上获得新的巨大成绩。这不是说，第十九次代表大会在思想工作问题上的指示，已经完全实现了。党组织的思想工作脱离实际生活，脱离目前苏联人民在共产党领导下所要解决的那些伟大任务，仍然是这一方面的巨大缺点。宣传和鼓动对于各地方党组织在实现党和政府的决议时所进行的细致的组织工作不能袖手旁观。
    在个别党委会的实际活动中还暴露出过低估计思想工作的现象。不久前举行的某些党代表会议就证明了这一点。在这些会议上思想工作问题没有获得应有的反映。
    在党和政府的决议中制定了为急剧提高农业和直接服务于人民消费的各工业部门而斗争的详尽纲领。所有这些决议标志着苏维埃社会主义经济发展的新阶段。这些决议的实现将在苏联人民为在苏联建成共产主义社会而斗争的历史上具有卓越的意义。
    用不着证明，要顺利地解决这些刻不容缓的重要任务，就要求更加提高我国人民的创造积极性和创造毅力，引导它们去利用工业和农业中的巨大潜力和后备力量，并消除思想工作中曾经有过的和现在还存在着的缺点。
            ×××
    关于人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题，近几年来在思想工作中、特别是在文字宣传和口头宣传中，有违背马克思列宁主义的观点的现象。在马克思列宁主义的文献中，在马克思列宁主义经典著作家马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作中，这个问题是早已解决了的。然而我们的宣传工作却不去正确地解释共产党之作为共产主义建设的真正领导力量的作用，常常偏重于个人崇拜，因而就歪曲了马克思主义。
    从马克思列宁主义科学的观点看来，社会历史就是人民群众的历史，也就是经常推动社会沿着进步的道路一直向前发展的社会物质文化财富生产者本身的历史。人民是历史的创造者，是历史的主人翁。正是人民不仅在社会生产过程中而且也在一切历史事件中起着决定性的作用。从古至今生动的历史事实，无可置辩地证明了这一点。
    这个不可动摇的马克思主义原理，决不降低一些卓越历史人物的非常重要的作用，这些卓越历史人物善于正确地理解社会发展的条件及其向好的方面变化的途径，善于在自己的世界观中正确地表现先进阶级在历史发展过程一定阶段上的需要。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林就是工人阶级所公认的伟大的工人阶级领袖。他们为了保卫最广大人民阶层的利益而进行的革命活动，被人民所公认，受到人民的崇高赞扬，并为人类历史的客观进程所肯定。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的名字在人民中、在历史上是永垂不朽的。
    我们党在自己的决议中不止一次地强调个人崇拜的害处，指出必须正确地解释群众、党、个人在历史上的作用问题。一九三八年，联共（布）中央在“关于因‘联共（布）历史简明教程’出版而应如何进行党的宣传工作的决议”中指出，庸俗化和简单化的表现之一就是“某些假理论家和宣传员从半‘社会革命’党人立场上来解释”个人在历史上的作用的反马克思主义的观点。
    思想战线上的工作人员曾经忘记了党的这一指示。在报刊篇幅上，在无线电广播中，在一切宣传鼓动工作中，在政治、科学和艺术的著作中，在剧院的舞台上，在艺术影片中，对于人民的作用，对于共产党的作用，直到最近解释得很少，而且解释得无味，有时甚至解释错了。在理论上和实践中只要滚到个人崇拜方面，就会减低党多年来所制定的建设共产主义社会的政策的意义，降低群众的创造积极性，造成对人民力量的不信任，使群众不可避免地趋于消极。
    在宣传工作中，特别是在党的教育系统中，至今还没有克服在评价历史事件上的主观主义毛病，还存在着对于党的代表大会、代表会议和苏共中央全会的决议的学习显然估计不足的现象。大家知道，在国内生活和国际事件的一切最重要的原则问题上，党是作为一个集体、作为苏联人民的政治领袖及其指导力量和领导力量来通过决议的。不久前出版的“苏联共产党代表大会、代表会议和中央全会决议与决定汇编”文集是学习苏联共产党的历史和政策的十分重要的必读文件。
    关于个人崇拜的问题不仅有理论的意义，而且有政治的、实践的意义。个人崇拜同集体领导的原则是矛盾的，它妨害批评和自我批评的开展，它给党的工作、国家的经济工作和文化工作的领导事业带来严重的损害。实践表明，没有集体意见支持的个人所做的决定，往往是片面的、错误的。
    保证党的领导的最高原则，即保证在各级党组织中、在选出的各级苏维埃组织和社会团体中从下而上的集体制，——这就是党号召于我们的。但是，集体领导并不排斥对党所委托的事业的个人负责制。体现着集体经验的决议一经通过之后，每个工作人员就必须坚持不渝地执行这个决议，负责实现这个决议。
    中央委员会是依靠马克思列宁主义理论的科学基础，依靠人民群众和领导干部的广泛主动性的；只有它的集体经验和集体智慧，才能保证领导党和国家的正确性，保证党的队伍的牢不可破的统一和团结，保证我国共产主义建设的胜利。苏共中央委员会坚决地遵守着我们党的伟大创造者列宁所制定的党内生活的准则，力求做到各级党组织愈益严格地执行集体领导的原则。最近举行的几次苏共中央全会，令人信服地证明了这一点，这些全会的决议是党的集体经验的表现。而苏共中央和政府在克里姆林宫所召开的全苏机器拖拉机站工作人员会议和苏联国营农场工作人员会议以及俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国农业先进工作者会议，也说明了这一点。在讨论农业问题中，在所通过的决议中，鲜明地表现了参加这些全会和会议的人们的集体意见，这些意见反映了真正的实际状况，反映了农业工作者的集体经验和他们的主动精神。
    早在革命前的年代里，列宁就把我们党的中央委员会称为“领导者集体”。列宁的这一准确的定义，目前在苏共中央的活动中，在它的工作作风和领导作风中深刻而且全面地表现了出来。党及其地方机关的集体领导，产生着良好的效果，在我国国民经济和文化发展中正取得新的成就。人民群众把党及其中央委员会和苏联政府的决议当成自己切身的事业，他们的积极性体现在生动的创造主动性的增长中，体现在劳动中，在国家活动中，在社会主义社会的全部生活中。
    苏联人民使我们祖国更加光荣和富足，他们实际上实现着共产主义社会创造者的历史使命，他们在苏维埃社会按照我们党所规划的道路继续向前发展中起着主要的决定性的作用。因此，根本改造党组织的群众鼓动工作和宣传工作，就具有非常重要的意义。
    党组织的群众政治工作，如能正确进行，就有助于劳动人民创造性主动性的发挥。群众提出新的迫切问题，提出各种建议，这些建议对于促使我们顺利前进，对于提高劳动生产率和开展新的大规模的创造性的劳动竞赛，提供许多新的可能性。实际生活现在特别迫切地要求党的工作人员抛弃拙劣的工作方法——忙于开会，起草不必要的“指示”，搜集汇报等等。更多地和更经常地深入到人民群众中去；仔细地倾听他们的要求、建议和经验；不仅使那些按时参加一切大小会议的积极分子受到政治影响，而且使普通苏联人受到政治影响。不经常地、搞运动式地来进行群众政治工作，这是不能容忍的，因为这样作的结果，就会在每次举行了运动之后，使党组织、宣传员和鼓动员对于居民工作的注意削弱下来。集体农庄合并之后，某些生产队里的政治工作搞得不好，这也是不能容忍的。在某些区里，苏共中央最近两次全会的决议还没有传达到每一个集体农民、国营农场和农业机器站的工作人员。
    要特别注意广泛地、经常地宣传科学成就和最好的企业、集体农庄、农业机器站、生产革新者—先进生产者的先进经验。而只有当号召采用先进经验的人本身了解进步的工作方法和操作方法的实质时，才能做到这一点。没有农业生产的基本知识，就不能顺利地号召人们来熟练地领导经济和运用先进经验。党的机关有一切可能来组织宣传员和鼓动员学习农业的基本知识，有一切可能把很熟悉集体农庄经济、农业技术和牲畜饲养技术问题的熟练的专家吸引来参加群众工作。
    对于地方出版局说来，目前再没有比出版关于农业科学成就和农业先进经验的好的通俗书籍更重要的任务了。各级党组织对这一工作不能放松监督，正如对图书发行机构的活动不能放松监督一样，这些图书发行机构，特别是在农业地区的，工作疲沓，对工作毫不关心。先进经验的书籍堆积在书库和书栈里，不仅没有送到集体农庄去，而且甚至没有送到农业机器站去。
    由于目前全国面临着的新的巨大任务，所以正确而系统地说明人民群众在创立新社会制度中的作用，说明共产党之作为共产主义建设的真正领导力量和指导力量的作用，说明党中央委员会之作为统一的团结一致的领导者集体、党的司令部的作用，说明党与人民的联系和团结一致，就具有特别重要的意义。培植人民对自己的伟大创造力量的信心，也具有特殊的意义。

    近几年来，在理论著作中，在宣传中，在鼓动工作中，以及在艺术作品中，关于工人阶级和集体农民联盟的问题，阐述得不好，或者根本就没有阐述。然而这一问题是共产党政策的根本问题之一，它向来就具有巨大的实践意义，目前在从社会主义过渡到共产主义的条件下，更具有巨大的实践意义。
    我们党的中央委员会和苏联政府不倦地关怀着工人阶级和集体农民联盟的巩固。由于工人阶级在国家社会主义工业化的发展方面、在重工业的发展方面获得了卓越的成绩，因而农业已为头等的技术所装备；在集体农庄和国营农场的田地里，目前有一百多万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、二十七万架谷物联合收割机及其他许多农业机器在工作着。约有十万名农学家和牲畜饲养家、两万多名工程师和技师被派到农业机器站和集体农庄去工作。工业企业对集体农庄农村的自愿帮助开展起来了，并且具有愈来愈广大的规模。目前城市、工人阶级和知识分子的帮助，对于加强集体农庄的文化机关，具有特别重要的意义。
    巩固工农联盟的任务，是与在我国国民经济中不断地贯彻劳动者物质利益的原则有着有机的联系。党和政府近来制定了若干保证提高集体农庄和集体农民在发展集体农庄生产中的物质利益的新措施。这是进一步巩固工农联盟的最重要的经济因素之一。物质利益的原则是保证急剧提高消费品生产的最重要的手段，因为它能使巨大的未被利用的生产后备力量发挥作用。
    顺利地执行党和政府关于进一步提高苏联农业、关于在我国生产丰足的农产品的决议，无疑地将促使工人阶级和集体农民的联盟更加巩固。这个联盟愈巩固，愈坚强，国家就愈有力量，愈强大，苏联劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平就提高得愈快。
    由此可见，有系统地和深刻地说明工人阶级和集体农民联盟对于我国共产主义建设的作用和意义，清楚地说明党和政府对进一步发展和巩固这一联盟的关心，说明工人和集体农民本身在巩固我国社会主义社会的两大友好阶级联盟方面的任务和职责，这在目前思想工作中是何等地重要。
    某些宣传员和某些论文作者的作法是不正确的，他们把苏维埃爱国主义和各族人民友谊的问题同工农联盟的问题割裂开来，而工农联盟则是我们国家巩固的基础，是苏维埃社会向共产主义前进的主要力量。只有在不倦地关怀巩固工农联盟的条件下，苏维埃爱国主义和苏联各族人民的友谊才能得到有成效的发展。同时，这个联盟本身就能培植苏维埃爱国主义和各族人民友谊的感情，它体现着苏联全体劳动人民的重大利益和苏联各民族之间兄弟般互助的必要性。因此，令人惊奇的是，在苏联科学院哲学研究所出了两版的“论苏维埃爱国主义”论文集中，十个作者在这一题目上都写了文章，但一个字也没有提到工农联盟。
    在我们的文字宣传和口头宣传中，关于苏维埃爱国主义和苏联各族人民友谊的意义，谈得并不少。但是常常抽象地、烦琐地谈到苏维埃社会的这些动力。缺乏具体的重大的例子来清楚地表明这些动力在我国全部国民经济和文化的强大发展中起着怎样伟大的作用。例如，用具体的事实和例子充分地表明苏维埃爱国主义之作为最高类型的爱国主义的特点，从实质上揭示苏联人的爱国主义如何表现在工人、集体农民和科学家的日常建设性的创造性的劳动中，表现在积极的社会活动中，表现在社会主义竞赛中，表现在为提高劳动生产率、改进产品质量、降低产品成本、利用新的潜力和后备力量以增加我们祖国的物质和精神财富而斗争的各种各样的事实中，这将是很有益处的。
    关于苏联各族人民友谊的论文和讲稿写得很多，但主要是从历史方面来说明这个问题。对于列宁斯大林的民族政策在每个共和国的经济、文化和国家制度的发展中所产生的具体的实际的效果，显然阐述得是不够的。关于苏联各民族历史问题的阐述，在个别历史学家和文学研究家的著作中至今还有资产阶级民族主义的曲解。
    在社会主义社会里，没有民族主义、沙文主义、种族仇恨和民族仇恨这些资产阶级思想占取统治地位的阶级基础。但是大家知道，苏维埃国家的敌人无论过去和现在都千方百计地力图复活资产阶级思想的残余，散播各民族之间的不信任和不和睦的种子。至于反对敌视人民的资产阶级民族主义残余表现的斗争，却进行得不够彻底，在个别场合下还对这些残余的代表者采取调和的态度。共产党不允许任何人削弱苏联一切民族的劳动人民的牢不可破的团结和友谊，党像保护眼珠一样地保护过并在今后仍然要保护苏联各民族的团结和友谊这个向共产主义前进的最重要的条件。
    苏联各族人民的友谊，新的社会主义各民族兄弟般的合作，是苏维埃政权的伟大成就，是实现共产党民族政策的结果。苏联社会主义各民族的形成和繁荣的历史经验，是使世界一切民族为之鼓舞的范例。

    在文字宣传和口头宣传中重大而又最普遍的缺点之一，就是在许多理论文章和宣传论文中，在讲演和报告中用教条主义的、书呆子的方法来讲述材料。不论是解释共产党历史和我们祖国历史中的过去事件也好，不论是研究和解释现代生活中的重要现象也好，教条主义和书呆子习气都使马克思列宁主义的宣传事业受到巨大的损害，妨害人们正确地理解那需要认真地深刻地进行科学研究和论述的东西。教条主义和书呆子习气使我们干部创造性地理解共产党和苏联政府的政策和顺利地实现这一政策的事业受到损害。
    马克思列宁主义的创造性质，要求我们也要以创造性的方法来研究和运用党的这一伟大武器。领会马克思列宁主义理论的实质，就是要善于应用它来正确地解决迫切的重大的问题。掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，一定要有实际生活的知识，要有实际生活发展的客观法则的知识，要有概括事实、分析现实的生动的现象、并由此做出正确的结论而将其运用到实际活动中去的本领。
    在我们的思想工作中理论问题往往脱离具体的现实，很少联系共产主义建设的实践，很少联系某
  一共和国、州、边疆区、区、企业、集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站的任务。把宣传鼓动同生活、同党和国家的实际任务密切地有机地联系起来，是根绝书呆子习气、根绝以咬文嚼字和烦琐议论的态度对待理论的不可缺少的条件。
    有些宣传员，把必须详尽地解释马克思主义科学的理论结论，常常归结为连篇累牍地引证有名的公式。这样的宣传员所采取的方法是朗诵背得烂熟的公式，而不是进行说服和论证。
    不言而喻，批评满篇引证的作风，决不是说不允许引证。问题不在于消灭文章、讲演或报告中的引证。问题是在于某些宣传员所表现出来的那种醉心于引证的作风，是毫无理由可言的。这种醉心于引证的作风，暴露出宣传员在他周围的现代生活的事实面前束手无策，即暴露出他们的烦琐议论和书呆子习气，他们是轻率地、漠不关心地和不用脑筋地对待事情，而不去研究并在理论上概括现实生活中所发生的现象。非常努力地抄录背得烂熟的原文，结果就把在内容上显然陈旧或对问题实质的解释很少帮助的引文加以运用。
    显然，书呆子在理论上和政治上感到胆怯，不敢独立地、创造性地说明问题。他害怕漏掉了什么东西，害怕漏掉了从马克思列宁主义经典著作中所作的任何一个引证，他的行动就像一个胆小怕事鬼：千万不要惹事生非，千万不要被人指责为过低估计了或忘记了某一个经典的公式。科学工作者的这类理论上的胆怯，在某种程度上也与个人崇拜有关，也与不相信自己的力量有关，也与不相信自己能够在认真细致地研究事实和生活现象、概括所积累的经验的基础上积极参加阐明和提出马克思列宁主义理论的新问题有关。
    必须指出，许多编辑和评阅文章的人给宣传员帮了倒忙，因而把书呆子习气和满篇引证的作风灌输到宣传中和科学中来。他们——仍然出于一种推卸责任和理论上胆怯的心情——常常提醒文章的作者“必须”加上某个引文。他们删掉作者自己的说法，即使这个说法确切地反映了某一经典原理的意思，只不过是用自己的话说出来的，或者那里漏掉了有关的引文中的某一两个字，或者补充了什么东西，虽然这并不是对“马克思主义的修正”。
    也常常发生这样的事情，报纸或杂志的编辑以书呆子方法校改过的某个作者的文章，失去自己的独创性，不新颖，没有新鲜的思想，也没有提出新问题。而且，很可惜，事情往往是这样：作者看到他的经过书呆子校改过的文章发表出来了，而没有被抛到字纸篓里去，仍然感到很满意。
    在编辑、批评家和评阅文章的人中间，相当普遍的现象是所批评的并不是文章中所写的东西，不是所论述的问题的内容，而是文章中所没有的东西。某些评阅文章的人首先感兴趣的，并不是作者所写的新东西，而是作者所没有提到的东西，那怕这与问题毫不直接相关。某个评阅文章的人认为，在书中或文章中一定要阐明甚至与主题极少关系的一切问题，那怕这些问题并不怎么重要，那怕不谈这些问题也并不会损害整个作品。
    这并不是说，任何文章或小册子，不问其理论水平如何，都应当刊印出来。这并不是说，可以降低对作者的要求。相反地，争取用创造性的态度对待理论，首先就必须提高对理论著作的作者的要求。
    为了同书呆子习气作斗争，现在应该放弃醉心于出版所谓注释性的小册子，即把个别马克思列宁主义经典著作的内容加以改写的小册子。密切联系我国目前所面临的极关重要的任务来研究这些著作本身，会更有益得多。
    要完成党在保证从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义方面所提出的基本政治经济任务，目前在全部思想工作中就必须集中注意力来动员苏联人民的创造力量，注意尚未解决的问题，注意利用暂时还远没有得到充分利用的内在后备力量和资源。我们的宣传员和鼓动员，根据他确知某一共和国、边疆区、州、区、企业、国营农场、集体农庄、农业机器站生活中的事实，有可能充分说明这一点的。同时，应该指出，许多党委会没有给宣传鼓动干部以必要的帮助，没有用具体的材料武装他们去进行有目的的紧要的宣传和鼓动。
    我们的全部宣传鼓动工作应当用来解决下列任务：提高共产主义建设各个部门的劳动生产率，严格遵守节约制度，改善产品质量和减低产品成本，加强劳动纪律，激励落后的企业、集体农庄、农业机器站达到先进的水平，而在先进的企业、集体农庄、农业机器站内则是提高既得的成绩并使之益臻完善，最高限度地利用工业、运输业和农业中所蕴藏的巨大潜力来不断提高我国的经济。宣传员和鼓动员的职责，就是广泛地阐明和开展城乡劳动人民的社会主义竞赛。如果一个宣传员或鼓动员不能帮助纠正缺点和错误，如果他本身不能成为群众执行党和政府决议的组织者，那就不能认为他们的工作是有价值的。党的宣传和鼓动如能与具体的组织工作密切配合，那末它们影响群众的力量就会更为显著。
    党的全部思想工作的主要目的是对劳动人民进行共产主义的教育，即培养千百万积极的共产主义的建设者，使他们更加顺利地实现代表苏联人民根本利益的党的政策。这是与必须用生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义、无产阶级国际主义和我国各族人民不可摧毁的友谊的精神来教育苏联人民相联系的。还必须更顽强地进行斗争以反对人们意识中的资本主义残余，反对旧社会的偏见和传统，反对资产阶级民族主义和腐败的资产阶级思想的任何表现。
    资产阶级的思想代表者和政治活动家为自己的今天而感到惊慌，对未来则感到恐惧。他们因民主阵营的巩固和帝国主义阵营力量的削弱而感到显著的不安。造成这些恐惧和疑虑的原因，是资本主义世界内部日益尖锐化的经济政治矛盾，资本主义总危机的加深，资本主义各国劳动群众的阶级意识的增强，他们之日益增强地反抗资本对居民的生活水平和民主权利的进攻。资产阶级的头子们害怕争取各国人民间的和平与反对新战争挑拨者的强大群众运动。资本主义国家和殖民地国家的人民不愿意在美帝国主义的铁蹄下生活下去，正在为自己的民族独立进行着斗争，他们的愤怒的增长使美国的思想代表者和政客们感到惧怕。
    我们社会主义社会正处在自己有生力量的繁荣时期，正沿着上升的路线不断地向前发展。社会主义经济制度的伟大优越性，愈益显著地表现在全体人民物质福利和文化水平的不断增长中，表现在劳动人民争取进一步提高国民经济的奋不顾身的斗争中。苏维埃社会勇敢地揭露并顺利地克服着工作中的缺点和社会主义建设进程中所产生的困难，向着共产主义的新的胜利前进。苏联人满怀信心地展望着未来，他们永不会感到笼罩着资产阶级世界的那种恐惧、惊慌和疑虑。依靠苏维埃制度的伟大优越性，我国人民以自己创造性的劳动增强着社会主义祖国的威力，高举起各族人民的和平与友谊的旗帜。
    我们的宣传、我们的文学和艺术应该真实地反映社会主义制度的伟大成就和优越性，反映苏维埃爱国者的创造性的活动。我们应当用从实际生活中取来的生动而鲜明的例子，充分地表明共产党之作为苏维埃社会的鼓舞力量、领导力量和组织力量的作用，表明人民群众之作为真正的历史创造者的作用，表明党、政府和人民的不可分割的团结一致。
    在党和苏联人民面前，现在摆着建成共产主义社会的庄严任务。我们的全部思想工作，思想战线上工作人员的全部活动（他们是把伟大的真理、战斗的行动指南——马克思列宁主义带到群众中去），就是旨在达到这一目标。
