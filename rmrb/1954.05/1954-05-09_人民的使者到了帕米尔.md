People's Envoys Arrive in the Pamirs
Zhao Dagang

	The days of strong winds suddenly ceased. The weather on the Pamir Plateau is particularly clear today. Blue sky, white clouds, thawed ice lakes, flying wild ducks, and herds of cattle and sheep peacefully nibbling on young buds, along with the joyful news of the arrival of loved ones, make people feel that spring has finally arrived on the "Roof of the World."

	They came, they crossed valleys, traversed snow mountains, forded icy rivers, climbed cliffs, braved the bitter cold of below freezing, and endured the difficulty of thin air. They came with Chairman Mao's care and the hearts of the people of the whole country. They mounted "wedding horses" adorned with red silk and green ribbons, passed through colorful "wedding gates," walked along wide and smooth "wedding roads," and arrived at the neatly and comfortably arranged "relatives' dormitories." Some of them came from Xinjiang, some from the motherland's capital that border guards long for day and night, and some from the Korean front lines thousands of miles away. What a great encouragement the representatives' reports and greetings are to the border guards stationed here! Cultural instructor Gao Jianguo presented a bouquet of beautiful paper flowers on behalf of all the border guards, and also dedicated the border guards' gratitude to their loved ones and their hearts to defend the motherland. He expressed the common feelings of the border guards as if reciting a poem: "...A child traveling a thousand miles worries his mother, but the representatives are even closer than mothers. ...Our determination has been written on the guarantee, our oaths will never be forgotten, please take it to the Party Central Committee, to Chairman Mao, to every part of the motherland, let the people of the whole country know: What do the border guards offer to the motherland, what do we use to respond to the expectations of the people of the whole country? Our task is to guard the border, our post is on the Pamir Plateau, holding submachine guns, warhorses by our side, our strong will is a copper wall and iron wall, we will use our youth and life to protect the flowering of socialism."

	Indeed, the border guards stationed here have in the past dedicated everything to the motherland and have not disappointed the expectations of the people of the whole country. It can be said that this is an extremely difficult place, six to seven thousand meters above sea level, with winter temperatures dropping to minus forty degrees Celsius, and snow accumulation of more than one meter on the ground. The air is thin, and water boils at eighty degrees. The climate is erratic, "four seasons in one day," often with clear skies in the morning, dust and sand in the midday, storms in the afternoon, and heavy snow at night. Sometimes it rains and snows at the foot of the mountains, while the sun shines brightly on the top. Year after year, day and night, the soldiers brave ice and snow, and sandstorms to guard and patrol the border, often climbing steep ice slopes, wading through cold rapids, nibbling on frozen buns, and sleeping in snowdrifts to perform their tasks. Difficulties and hardships cannot deter them, but become conditions for them to win honor. They say, "No difficulty is greater than our determination, no Pamir is higher than our heels," their slogan is: "The more difficult, the more glorious, the more difficult, the more tenacious." They use the Red Army in the 25,000-li Long March and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea to inspire and encourage themselves. They not only guard, but also produce. They dig grass in the ice lakes, collect firewood in the snow mountains, fill in mountain gullies to grow vegetables, and also entrust the representatives to bring their labor fruits: a cabbage weighing thirty-five jin and a radish weighing fifteen jin, to Chairman Mao. They also wrote a letter, saying: "...We live very well, we use our strong bodies and firm will to protect the motherland, we create everything with our own hands..." The border guards are the strongest people, but also the happiest people. They have hard work, but also a happy life. They use tin cans to make huqins, wild goat horns as clappers, and marmot skins stretched over empty ammunition boxes to make drums. They use these simple instruments to sing about their lives, sing about the construction of the motherland, not only for their own entertainment, but also to educate the masses, so the Tajik villagers call them the Pamir's "cultural troupe."

	These days, the "relatives' dormitory" is particularly crowded and noisy. It is filled with hearty laughter and cheerful songs. Border guards come here in a continuous stream to listen to the construction of the motherland and express their determination to defend it. Platoon leader Feng Jianlin said to Shang Yanfa, a second-class combat hero of the Volunteers, "We must learn from the most beloved people—the Volunteers—the spirit of bravery and tenacity in combat and the valuable experience of fighting against the imperialist aggressors." Shang Yanfa humbly said: "We must also learn from the most beloved people—the veteran soldiers of the People's Liberation Army—the valuable experience of regular military training and the fine tradition of hard work and endurance." Zhang Bingku, the platoon leader of the machine gun squad, and the soldiers held the hand of Gao Caizhang, a representative from Beijing, tightly and said:

"Please tell Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country that as long as the motherland is built well, even if we suffer a little, our hearts are sweet. Your condolences have added infinite strength to us. We must guard the western gate of the motherland and not allow the imperialists to move a single blade of grass or tree of our motherland."

    人民的使者到了帕米尔
    赵大纲
    连日的大风，突然停了。帕米尔高原上的天气，今天显得格外晴朗。蓝天，白云，解冻了的冰湖，飞翔的野鸭，加上安详地啃着嫩芽的成群的牛羊，随着亲人来到的喜讯，使人感到春天毕竟来到了“世界屋脊”之上了。
    他们来了，他们穿过了峪谷，越过了雪山，渡过了冰河，爬过了峭壁，冒着零下十几度的奇寒，忍受着空气稀薄的困难来了。他们带着毛主席的关怀，全国人民的心意来了。他们跨上了披红挂绿的“迎亲马”，穿过五彩缤纷的“迎亲门”，走过宽敞平整的“迎亲路”，来到了布置得整洁舒适的“亲人宿舍”。他们有的来自新疆，有的来自边防战士日夜向往的祖国首都，还有的来自远隔万里的朝鲜前线。代表们的报告和慰问，对守卫在这里的边防战士是多大的鼓舞啊！文化教员高建国代表全体边防军献上一束美丽的纸花，同时也献上了边防战士感激亲人和保卫祖国的心，他像背诵诗篇一样来表达边防战士共同的心情：“……儿行千里娘操心，代表比娘还要亲。……我们的决心已写在保证书上，我们的誓言永远不忘，请你们把它带给党中央，带给毛主席，带到祖国每一个地方，让全国人民知道：边防战士拿什么献给祖国，拿什么回答全国人民的期望。我们的任务是守卫国境，我们的岗位在帕米尔高原上，端着冲锋枪，战马在身旁，我们的坚强意志，就是一道铜壁铁墙，我们要用自己的青春和生命，保卫社会主义鲜花开放。”
    的确，守卫在这里的边防战士，过去是把一切献给了祖国，没有辜负全国人民的期望。这里，可以说是一个极其艰苦的地方，拔海六、七千公尺，冬天气温降到零下四十多度，平地积雪也在一公尺以上，空气稀薄，水到八十度就开。气候则变化无常，“一日四季”，常常早晨万里无云，中午尘沙漫天，下午狂风骤雨，夜晚大雪纷飞。有时山下雨雪交加，山上阳光四射。战士们经年累月，日日夜夜地披冰雪冒风沙守卫和巡逻在国境线上，常常爬过陡峭的冰坡，涉过寒冷的急流，啃着冰冻的馒头，睡在雪窝里执行任务。困难，艰苦，不能吓退他们，而且成为他们争取荣誉的条件。他们说：“困难再大大不过我们的决心，帕米尔再高高不过我们的脚跟”，他们的口号是：“越艰苦，越光荣，越困难，越顽强。”他们用两万五千里长征中的红军，用在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军来激励自己，鼓舞自己。他们不光是守卫，还在生产，他们到冰湖里挖草，到雪山上打柴，他们填平山沟种菜，他们还把自己的劳动果实：一棵三十五斤重的白菜，一棵十五斤重的萝卜，托代表们带给毛主席，同时还写了一封信，信上说：“……我们生活得很好，我们用健壮的身体和坚强的意志保卫着祖国，我们用双手创造了一切……”边防战士是最坚强的人，同时也是最快乐的人，他们有艰苦的工作，也有愉快的生活。他们用罐头盒做胡琴，用野羊角当梆子，用旱獭皮蒙在空子弹箱上做大鼓，他们就用这些简陋的乐器来歌唱自己的生活，歌唱祖国的建设，不单自己娱乐，还用来教育群众，所以塔吉克的老乡称他们是帕米尔的“文工团”。
    这几天，“亲人宿舍”显得特别拥挤和喧闹。里面充满了爽朗的笑声和愉快的歌声，边防战士们川流不息地来到这里，听祖国的建设情形，表示自己保卫它的决心。班长冯健林向志愿军二级战斗英雄尚衍发说：“我们一定要向最可爱的人——志愿军学习勇敢顽强的战斗精神和打击帝国主义侵略军的宝贵经验”。尚衍发谦逊地说：“我们也一定要向最可爱的人——解放军老大哥学习正规化军事训练的宝贵经验和吃苦耐劳的优良传统。”机枪一班班长张炳库和战士们紧握着来自北京的代表高彩章的手说：
  “请你告诉毛主席，告诉全国人民，只要祖国建设好，我们就是吃点苦，心里也是甜的。你们的慰问给我们增加了无穷的力量，我们一定要守住祖国的西大门，不让帝国主义动我们祖国的一草一木。”（附图片）
