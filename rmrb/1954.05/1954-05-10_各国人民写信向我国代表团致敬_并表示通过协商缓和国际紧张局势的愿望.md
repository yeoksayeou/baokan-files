Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 8th. In the past ten days, the delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Geneva Conference has continuously received telegrams and letters from Switzerland, France, and various parts of the world, in the name of organizations or individuals, saluting the Chinese delegation and expressing their desire for the Geneva Conference to achieve agreements through sincere consultations among all parties concerned, thereby consolidating peace in Asia and easing international tensions.

    The Miners' Union of Senftenberg near Zurich sent a telegram saying: "Your work will make a great contribution to easing international tensions. We will fight together with the great, victorious Chinese people for world peace."

    The Lower Seine Provincial Committee of the French Peace Movement expressed its infinite hope for the Geneva Conference in a letter, and enclosed a copy of the committee's letter to Bidault, which stated: "We urge [you] to comply with the will of the French people, sign a ceasefire agreement with the Ho Chi Minh government, and negotiate a just peace."

    A telegram from the "International Resistance Movement Association" in France stated: "This association unites people and victims from more than twenty European countries who resisted Nazi aggression in the past. We request the foreign ministers at the Geneva Conference to make their utmost efforts to reach a peaceful settlement and to stop the war in Vietnam as soon as possible. Based on our own suffering and experience during the Hitler occupation, we demand respect for the sovereignty and independence of all Asian nations, the establishment of lasting peace, and the easing of international tensions that the people of the world ardently desire."

    A telegram from the National Union of Teachers of France, representing more than 200,000 members, expressed anxiety about the possibility of the internationalization of the Indochina War and demanded that maximum efforts be made to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue immediately. A letter from the 8th Section of the French Peace Movement in the 8th Arrondissement of Paris, representing the views of the majority of residents in the district, demanded an immediate end to the Indochina War, believing that "the Geneva Conference allows the French government to contact representatives of major powers to negotiate a ceasefire and the easing of international tensions."

    The French People's Liberation Movement (an organization of working and housewives) sent signed letters demanding the success of the Geneva Conference.

    The Platot District Committee of the Algerian Communist Party in North Africa sent a letter to the Geneva Conference, which was attended by the foreign ministers of the five major powers, urging: "An immediate ceasefire in Indochina, negotiations between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for a ceasefire, preparations for the withdrawal of the French Expeditionary Force, including Algerian soldiers, and recognition and guarantee of the right of the Vietnamese people to handle their own affairs."

    The West German Tronstein Construction, Stonemason, and Bricklayer Workers' Union, in a letter addressed to the foreign ministers of the five major powers, demanded that the Geneva Conference "peacefully resolve the Far East issue and determine to prohibit the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. We demand to live and work in peace. We expect you to make a decision."

    A letter from the Newcastle District Peace Committee of Hamilton, Australia, stated: "The main slogan of the Australian Peace Congress Standing Committee is to seek peace through consultation and discussion. We urge the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to consult with representatives of other countries at the Great Powers Conference to seek a complete ban on hydrogen bombs and all other weapons of mass destruction, and to achieve disarmament through consultation."

    Michio Nonaka, a Japanese citizen who was victimized by the American hydrogen bomb test disaster in the Pacific two months ago, sent a letter from Tokyo Hospital detailing his suffering and requesting the Geneva Conference to discuss "prohibiting the testing of atomic weapons, prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, destroying all existing weapons, and using atomic energy for peaceful purposes."
