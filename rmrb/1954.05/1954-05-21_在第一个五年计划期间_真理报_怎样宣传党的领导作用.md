Soviet Newspaper Experience

    How "Pravda" Promoted the Party's Leadership Role During the First Five-Year Plan
    Lu Tianhong
    Soviet newspapers have always attached importance to comprehensively reflecting the Party's life and its leading role in economic construction. The Soviet newspapers, especially "Pravda,"’s publicity on the Party's life and its leading role in economic construction, played a significant role in consolidating the unity and solidarity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, continuously improving the ideological awareness of Party members, defending the Party's line, and mobilizing and organizing the entire Party and all the people to struggle to realize the Party's line. Our country has entered the second year of planned construction. Today, learning from "Pravda"'s propaganda experience in this regard during the period of the first five-year plan is of great significance for improving our newspaper's propaganda work.

    The 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in April 1929 discussed and adopted the first five-year plan to equip Soviet industry and agriculture with modern technology. "The basic task of the Five-Year Plan is to create in our country a heavy industry that can transform and reorganize not only the entire industry but also the transportation industry and agriculture according to socialist principles." [Note 1] Subsequently, the Bolshevik Party launched a comprehensive offensive for socialist industrialization. What is the essence of this offensive? Comrade Stalin pointed out:

      “The essence of the Bolshevik offensive is, first of all, to mobilize the attention and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to oppose the capitalist elements in our country; to mobilize the creativity and independence of the masses to oppose the bureaucracy in our organs and enterprises, because they bury many reserves and hide them in the center of our system, preventing them from being used; to organize socialist competition and mass labor enthusiasm to increase labor productivity and expand socialist construction.

    “The essence of the Bolshevik offensive, secondly, is to begin to transform the entire practical work of trade unions, cooperatives, Soviets, and all other mass organizations to meet the needs of the era of transformation; to create the most active and revolutionary core of workers there, to expel and isolate opportunists, trade unionists, and bureaucrats; to eradicate alien and degenerate elements from them, and to promote new workers from below.

    “The essence of the Bolshevik offensive also lies in collecting as much money as possible to support our industry, our Soviet farms, and collective farms, and sending the best people from our party to expand this cause.

    “Finally, the essence of the Bolshevik offensive is to mobilize the Party itself to organize the entire offensive cause; to consolidate and rectify the Party's organization, to drive out the bureaucratic elements and degenerate phenomena there; to isolate and expel the spokesmen of the ‘left’ and right factions who deviate from the line of the Leninist Party, and to promote true and firm Leninists to work at the top.” [Note 2]

    This is the propaganda program that Soviet newspapers relied on in the struggle to achieve socialist industrialization.

      How did "Pravda" realize this propaganda program?

      I. Struggle for Party Unity

    The 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) ideologically and organizationally shattered the Trotskyites. After the congress, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued to oppose the Trotskyites, and its main force was to oppose the right-leaning opportunist Bukharin and Rykov anti-Party clique. The Party had to smash the restorationists of the bourgeoisie and unite the Bolsheviks and the working people around itself. Without all of this, socialist construction could not be victorious.

    "Pravda" actively fought against right-leaning opportunism on the basis of Marxism. "Pravda" actively defended Lenin's idea that socialism could be built independently in one country, defended the idea of socialist industrialization and the worker-peasant alliance, opposed the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and defended Lenin's idea that the closer the class enemies are to death, the greater the achievements of socialism, and the sharper the class struggle, pointing out that the class struggle would only disappear after the classes are eliminated. "Pravda" exposed the right-leaning opportunists as the agents of the rich peasants, and pointed out that if the right wing were to win, it would disarm the working class and give the bourgeoisie the opportunity to restore.

    At the same time, "Pravda" also fought against the "left"-leaning phenomena of distorting the Party's policies. In the agricultural collectivization movement, some people distorted the Party's policies, committed the illness of impatience, violated the principle of voluntariness, and used administrative orders to accelerate the establishment of collective farms, which was dangerous.

  "Pravda" published two articles written by Comrade Stalin entrusted by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Dizzy with Success" and "Reply to Comrades Working in Collective Farms," giving sharp criticism to those who made mistakes. "Pravda" proposed that it is necessary to correct the wrong attitude towards middle peasants, it is necessary to implement the firm alliance of the proletariat and the middle peasants, and to implement an offensive against rural capitalist elements.

    Before the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was held in June 1930, on May 21, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) announced the draft of the outline of the first five-year plan and the report outline on agricultural collectivization and other issues. The next day, "Pravda" organized a discussion page. The first issue of the discussion page pointed out that the purpose of the discussion was to help the Party clarify its thinking and summarize experience on the several issues discussed, and to make the results of the discussion further enrich the Party's work experience in order to further engage in socialist construction. The enemies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had attempted to make the Party weaker in the discussion, but the Party was stronger after the discussion. Many articles signed by Party members were published on the discussion page, including those on the problems of Party life at this stage, the problems in agricultural collectivization work, the tasks of trade unions, and so on. These articles were all opinions on the report outline announced by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The discussion page continued until the opening of the Congress. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the rapporteur considered the opinions put forward on the page. Such a discussion fully promoted Party democracy and brought into play collective will. This discussion further marked the unity of the Party and the victory of the Party's general line.

    The first five-year plan put forward new tasks to the Bolshevik Party, that is, to pay attention to the Party's organizational problems and improve the Party's work. The class situation in the Soviet Union also required this. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union must absorb a large number of advanced workers into the Party. According to Lenin, they were the only force that could directly oppose the bourgeoisie. The achievements of socialist construction greatly increased the Party's prestige, and a large number of fellow travelers who remained outside the Party asked to join the Party. Therefore, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union must take measures to prevent the petty bourgeoisie from mixing into the Party, because the petty bourgeoisie is the social root of distorting the Party's line, creating sectarian activities and degeneration. "Pravda" explained the conditions of Party members, and advocated absorbing advanced elements of the working class, which is the guarantee of Party unity and the realization of the Party's line. Comrade Stalin published an article in "Pravda" in February 1934, pointing out that the fact that a large number of workers requested to join the Party shows that the Party's leadership is correct, the Party's policies are correct, the Party's victory, and the broad masses believe in the Party's policies. But this does not mean that everyone who is willing to join the Party is absorbed into the Party. The Party's task is to individually absorb those who have been tested into the Party. "Pravda" pointed out that it requires not only quantity but also quality. "Pravda" systematically publicized the issue of expanding the Party's ranks and improving the quality of Party members, and the newspaper set up a special column: "The proletariat sends the best elements into the Party."

    With the entry of new Party members, ideological education work was given an important position. It is necessary to arm new Party members with Marxism-Leninism, train them, and participate in the cause of socialist construction. "Pravda" systematically carried out the ideological education of Party members, called for strengthening Party life, promoting Party democracy, and opposing bureaucracy in the Party. "Pravda" regarded the frequent reporting of the study of Marxism-Leninism as an indispensable task for opposing opportunism and realizing socialist transformation.

    II. Struggle for Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism

    While implementing a comprehensive socialist offensive, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union vigorously carried out criticism and self-criticism. The slogan of criticism and self-criticism is part of the entire proletarian dictatorship system. The Soviet state is a state of proletarian dictatorship, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the only ruling party. Therefore, the Party can only rely on itself to expose shortcomings and correct shortcomings. Criticism and self-criticism has become a driving force for the development of socialist society, relying on it to fight against the old and dying things and help the growth of new things. Criticism and self-criticism is also a good way to attract the masses to participate in socialist construction. Only by allowing workers and other working people to directly criticize the shortcomings and errors of the work of the Party and government organs can they actively participate in the construction of the country, and improve their labor enthusiasm and creativity. Criticism is of great significance to Party life, and it is of even more urgent significance during the first five-year plan. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out in a letter to all Party members and all workers in 1928 that without criticism from below and without the active participation of the workers, socialist construction would be impossible. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union required the workers to launch criticism regardless of sentiment, making it a lever to fundamentally transform the work of the organs. In order to make this criticism not just empty talk, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the slogan of criticism "regardless of the object, regardless of sentiment, from top to bottom, and from bottom to top." This is also the slogan for newspapers to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarded carrying out criticism as a method of educating and training cadres, and fought against suppressing critics. "Pravda" paid special attention to carrying out criticism of bureaucracy. "Pravda" pointed out that bureaucracy is one of the Party's enemies, and this enemy exists both in the organs and in the Party. How to eliminate bureaucracy? There is only one way, that is, to organize criticism from both below and above. "Pravda" pointed out that leaders are experienced, but they only look at problems from above, and their vision is limited; millions of workers have accumulated a lot of experience in socialist construction, but they only look at problems from below, and they are also limited; the correct conclusion must come from the synthesis of experience from both sides. Leaders must have foresight, but only those who are closely connected with life can have foresight. At the same time, only when millions of people participate in the leadership work can errors and shortcomings be eliminated in the bud. In order to launch this wave of criticism from below, "Pravda" organized a special page for "Worker-Peasant Inspection," which was published once a week, full of critical articles. These manuscripts came from the Party's Supervisory Committee and the Soviet Worker-Peasant Supervision Bureau, as well as letters from the broad masses. The content of the special page was diverse, and it fought against the shortcomings of the Party, the Soviets, and all aspects. Sometimes the materials were concentrated on one issue. For example, on February 24, 1929, it focused on inspecting how the Moscow organs received mass visits; on March 29, it focused on inspecting how the organs implemented the Party's instructions to promote workers, peasants, and women cadres to leading positions; on August 20, it published materials inspecting the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station project. "Pravda" paid great attention to the effectiveness of this criticism, so the special page also published the results of the previous criticism. This is good for carrying out criticism from below, because the masses personally saw the effect of their criticism.

    "Pravda" also educated Party cadres to correctly treat criticism. It is difficult to make people feel as happy as they are rewarded. But discomfort is a guarantee that people can correct their shortcomings more quickly. Party workers can not only bravely criticize others, but also bravely accept criticism from others. This is the correct Bolshevik position.

    III. Regarding the Party's Organizational Leadership

    During the first five-year plan, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarded the training of cadres as the primary task. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed that it was necessary to train leading cadres from the working class, cadres who could lead enterprises politically and productively. Without this condition, it would not be possible to turn backward Russia into an advanced industrialized country. At that time, what was needed was not ordinary cadres, but experts and capable cadres who needed to be trained at a faster rate. Comrade Stalin pointed out at the Eighth Congress of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League: There are as many cadres as you want who are willing to participate in and lead the construction, but there are too few cadres who are good at construction and leadership. Some people are still praising their own lack of culture, they believe that if a person has no culture and the articles they write are grammatically incorrect, as long as they grow up next to the lathe, they are authentic workers, who can be valued and promoted. If you have culture and more knowledge, you are considered to have left the position of the working class. Comrade Stalin pointed out that if this barbaric attitude towards science and culture is not eliminated, it will not be possible to move forward. He said that the Soviet Union does not need just any kind of industrial commanders and engineering and technical personnel, but those who can understand the policies of the working class, can understand this policy, and are determined to sincerely implement it. Therefore, the working class should create its own production technology intelligentsia, that is, the production technology intelligentsia that can safeguard the interests of its ruling class in production.

    At that time, there were very few economic cadres in the Soviet Union. Although most of the technical personnel could work honestly, some of the upper layers of the bourgeois intellectuals were carrying out sabotage activities. At that time, some Party leading cadres could not see it, because they did not understand technology. The Shakhty incident in the Donets mining area was a sabotage activity carried out by the bourgeoisie using the ignorance of the Party's economic work cadres. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union strictly criticized the errors committed by the economic work cadres in the Shakhty incident, and required the Party factory directors in the factories at that time to strengthen technical learning and accelerate the mastery of technology. Without this criticism and urging, it would not be possible to quickly train the Party's economic work cadres, and it would not be possible to quickly eliminate technical backwardness. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union also criticized the cadres who committed "left"-leaning errors in the agricultural collectivization movement in 1930. The cadres of the collective farms were trained in this correction of errors. But some cadres still did not understand this need, and they still learned very slowly. Therefore, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and "Pravda" raised the issue of cadres very sharply, pointing out that Bolsheviks must master technology. "Pravda" published the essay "It's Time for Bolsheviks Themselves to Become Experts," and set up a regular column "Struggle for Cadres" in 1930, which lasted for a considerable period of time. "Pravda" also paid special attention to the reporting of industrial colleges that specialize in training economic leading cadres.

    In addition to the issue of cadres, the organizational leadership work of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union also produced the issue of checking the implementation of resolutions in actual life. The Shakhty incident not only exposed the seriousness of the cadre issue, but also exposed that some Party organizations did not pay attention to checking the implementation of resolutions. Some leading cadres were only busy making resolutions and issuing instructions, but did not do concrete work and did not approach the masses. They only shouted slogans to mobilize the masses, but did not know how to mobilize the masses and what to do after mobilizing the masses. "Pravda" criticized these leading cadres. There was such a district committee secretary, he was going on vacation, he handed over the work to the deputy secretary, and instructed: "I am going on vacation, I have prepared ten draft resolutions. You can call the chairman of the collective farm to talk, fill in the blank numbers on the resolution, and report to the superior, and the superior will not criticize us for not preparing for spring plowing." Although there are not many such people, they do exist, which shows that some people still believe in the magic of this kind of empty resolution. Leading cadres must organize the implementation of resolutions and pay attention to checking the implementation of resolutions. "Pravda" often paid attention to reporting on this aspect of the issue, and pointed out more than once that the issue of checking the implementation of resolutions and guaranteeing the implementation of resolutions should be raised to the level of principle.

    That is to say, the newspaper must educate Party cadres to establish the correct Bolshevik leadership style: they must have revolutionary courage and a practical spirit; leadership must be principled, and work must be concrete and efficient; they must develop a spirit of initiative, be sensitive to new things, and have foresight; they must be simple, modest, loyal, honest, and connect with the masses, and be able to carry out criticism and self-criticism and maintain vigilance.

      IV. The Tasks of Party Organizations in Economic Work

    In order to realize the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union, it is necessary to strengthen the management of economic organs. But at that time, some economic organs lacked the basic knowledge of economic management, especially the leading of Party and economic work lacked a clear division of labor. In some places, the Party directly interfered in economic work, replacing economic leadership, which caused a phenomenon of no one being responsible in the economic organs. In other places, the economic leaders did not respect the Party's leadership and did not pay attention to the opinions of the masses. It is necessary to eliminate this phenomenon and establish normal relations in the leadership of enterprises. In September 1929, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) made a resolution on improving the leadership of enterprises and establishing a one-person management system, which determined the division of labor between the administrative leadership of enterprises and the Party's leadership, pointing out that the economic workers directly lead the enterprises, and the Party organization cannot replace the administrative leadership. The basic tasks of the Party organization are to provide political leadership to economic work and the masses, to cultivate the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the masses, so as to ensure the completion of economic work tasks. This resolution also stipulated the establishment of a strict system.

    "Pravda" assisted the Party in consolidating the one-person management system of enterprises, and published many communications on the Party-government relations in enterprises, explaining that the one-person management system does not ignore public opinion, does not want the masses, but should rely on the Party's supervision and combine it with the enthusiasm and initiative of workers and technicians. "Pravda" attached importance to the issue of how to convene production meetings, and published many articles on how to discuss economic issues at Party committee meetings and Party activists meetings. At the same time, "Pravda" not only explained from the principle, but also through examples of practical work, how the Party, administrative organizations, and trade unions divide their work, and how they realize the Party's general line from different perspectives, such as administration from production, the Party from politics, and trade unions from the issue of organizing competitions and living welfare.

    However, some Party organizations did not fully understand the spirit of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at first, which led to some errors. "Pravda" carried out a struggle against two tendencies for this, pointing out that the Party organizations and Party leaders should, without exception, care about the overall economic life and deeply grasp the economic cause, but do not directly interfere in economic affairs, because that is the direct responsibility of economic workers. But this does not mean getting rid of production, but getting closer to production, to comprehensively and deeply grasp the economy, but to treat economic issues from the standpoint of political leadership. The Party's leading organ is a political leading organ, and it is an organ that decides the political direction of all work. The task of the Party organization is to supervise how the economic work grasps the Party's line, to supervise how the economic workers implement the Party's general line, how they complete the activities of the national plan, and to help them with their political work for the masses, so as to guarantee the completion of economic tasks. Therefore, when leading economic work, the Party organization must not only determine the direction and implement supervision, but also understand the actual situation and implement concrete leadership. The leaders of the Party organizations in factories and enterprises should understand production and understand management work, but he should not fail to see the future, should not be a philistine who fails to see the political line, he should be a politician. That is to say, he must be good at analyzing the environment, understanding the economic life and the situation and characteristics of economic institutions, observing every process and phenomenon in economic and social life, predicting its development, and determining the working principles based on these.

    "Pravda" educated cadres to recognize that the Party organization is an organ that organizes the mutual cooperation of various organizations, just like the commander of the army commands various arms of the military to cooperate in combat. The leaders of Party organizations should educate cadres in all aspects—Soviet workers, economic workers, trade union workers, Youth League workers, and even cultural workers—to care about the prospects of construction, care about the general line, care about the realization of industrialization, and organize them to cooperate with each other and fight for the realization of the general line. The Party must lead and rely on these organizations to educate the masses. The newspaper should publish articles on the experience in this regard. But here it is not allowed to lower the Party's political leadership to the general level, that is, to lower the Party organization to the level of a consultative body parallel to other organizations.

    "Pravda" educated cadres to recognize that after the Party has pointed out the political direction, it is necessary to turn the Party's political direction into practical life, and fight for the realization of the general line. Mass political work is one of the powerful levers for the Party to mobilize and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the entire Party and the broad masses to realize this task. The basic method of mass political work is to organize propaganda and agitation teams in factories and villages, and Party leading cadres to make political reports to the people. "Pravda" used its reports to help Party organizations correctly use these forms, criticize the shortcomings in propaganda and agitation and lectures, introduce successful experiences; and pointed out that the Party's propaganda tools such as radio, movies, theaters, etc. are powerful tools that politically and ideologically influence the masses, and newspapers at all levels should also pay attention to reporting these works, so as to continuously improve the consciousness of the workers.

    "Pravda" launched a huge organizational education work to complete the first five-year plan of socialist construction. Because the completion of the first five-year plan is not only of great significance to the Soviet Union, but also of great international significance; the completion of the first five-year plan is not only the cause of the Soviet people, but also the cause of the international proletariat. "Pravda" published many special issues when the first five-year plan was completed, publicizing its great significance. When summarizing the achievements of the first five-year plan, "Pravda" warned all Party members not to be arrogant and not to be dizzy with victory. "Pravda" pointed out that the Party has won victory because it has the correct line, because the Party is built on the ideological foundation of Marxism, so it should be loyal to Marxist doctrine. The Soviet working class is powerful because it has the support of all the peasants, because the friendly unity of all nationalities is constantly consolidated, so it should further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and further consolidate the friendly unity with all nationalities. The Soviet Union is powerful because it has the support of the international working class, so it is necessary to promote the spirit of internationalism and further consolidate the connection with the working classes of all countries.

    The experience of Soviet newspapers also tells us: Although in a general sense, every material on the Party's newspaper should be a material of Party life, and should be to explain all social life phenomena with the Party's stand, viewpoints, and methods, and guide the masses to strive for the direction; but in reporting Party life, reporting the Party's mass political work, educating and uniting Communists, improving the work level of Party organizations, and enabling them to more effectively implement the political supervision of the work of local state organs and economic organs, and play their political and organizational role in the masses, the Party Life Department has special responsibilities.

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Party committees at all levels paid great attention to the working conditions of the Party Life Department of their newspapers. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) made several resolutions on improving the work of the Party Life Department of the central and local newspapers and how to carry out the work. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union also attached great importance to the selection and allocation of staff for the Party Life Department, assigning cadres with sufficient theoretical literacy, Party spirit training, and considerable practical experience to work in the Party Life Department, so as to continuously improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level, Party spirit cultivation, and close connection with practical life in the work of the Party Life Department, so as to reach the level required by the Party.

    在第一个五年计划期间“真理报”怎样宣传党的领导作用
    陆天虹
    苏联报纸一向是重视全面反映党的生活和党在经济建设中的领导作用的。苏联报纸特别是“真理报”关于党的生活和党在经济建设中的领导作用的宣传，对于巩固苏联共产党的统一和团结，不断提高党员的思想觉悟，捍卫党的路线，动员和组织全党和全体人民实现党的路线的斗争，都起着重大的作用。我们国家已进入有计划建设的第二年。今天，学习“真理报”在国民经济第一个五年计划时期这一方面的宣传经验，对改进我们报纸的宣传工作，有着极为重要的意义。
    一九二九年四月联共（布）第十六次代表会议，讨论和通过了用现代技术装备苏联工农业的第一个五年计划。“五年计划底基本任务，就是要在我国创立一种不仅能把全部工业，而且能把运输业和农业都按社会主义原则改造改组过来的重工业。”〔注一〕接着，布尔什维克党为社会主义工业化展开了全面的进攻。这种进攻的本质是什么？斯大林同志曾指出：
      “布尔什维克的进攻的本质，首先就是发动群众的注意力和革命的积极性去反对我国的资本主义分子；发动群众的创造性和独立性去反对我们机关和企业中的官僚主义，因为他们埋没许多后备军，把他们隐藏在我们制度的中心里，不让他出来应用；组织社会主义竞赛和群众的劳动热潮，去提高劳动生产率，扩张社会主义建设。
    “布尔什维克的进攻的本质，第二，就是着手改造职工会、合作社、苏维埃和一切其他群众组织的全部实际工作，使它适合改造时代的需要；在那里造成最积极、最革命的工作人员的中坚分子，排挤和隔绝机会主义分子、职工主义分子、官僚主义分子；铲除其中异己和蜕化分子，自下提拔新的工作人员。
    “布尔什维克的进攻的本质，还有就是尽量的收集款子去接济我们的工业，接济我们苏维埃农场和集体农场，派送我们党的最好的人们去扩张这种事业。
    “最后，布尔什维克的进攻的本质，就是发动党的本身，去组织全部进攻事业；巩固和整顿党的组织，赶走那里的官僚主义分子和蜕化的现象；隔绝和排挤脱离列宁党路线的‘左’右派的说客，提拔真正的坚定的列宁主义者到上面去做工。”〔注二〕
    这就是苏联报纸在实现社会主义工业化的斗争中所根据的宣传纲领。
      “真理报”是怎样实现这一宣传纲领的呢？
      一、为党的统一而斗争
    联共（布）的第十五次代表大会，从思想上、组织上粉碎了托洛茨基分子。大会以后，苏联共产党继续反对托洛茨基分子，而主要力量是反对右倾机会主义的布哈林、李可夫反党集团。党必须把资产阶级复辟派粉碎，把布尔什维克和劳动人民团结在自己的周围，没有这一切，社会主义建设就不能得到胜利。
    “真理报”在马克思主义基础上积极地为反对右倾机会主义而斗争。“真理报”积极地捍卫了列宁的社会主义能在一个国家独立建成的思想，捍卫了社会主义工业化和工农联盟的思想，反对了阶级斗争熄灭论，捍卫了列宁的阶级敌人越是临近死亡、社会主义成就越大、阶级斗争越尖锐的思想，指出阶级斗争只有在阶级消灭以后才会消失。“真理报”揭穿了右倾机会主义者是富农的代理人，并指出，如果右派得到胜利，就将解除工人阶级的武装，给资产阶级以复辟的机会。
    同时，“真理报”又和“左”倾的曲解党的政策的现象进行了斗争。在农业集体化运动中，有些人曲解党的政策，犯了急性病，违反了自愿原则，用行政命令来加速建立集体农庄，这是危险的。
  “真理报”发表了联共（布）中央委托斯大林同志所写的两篇文章：“胜利冲昏头脑”、“给集体农庄工作同志们的答复”，给犯错误的人以尖锐的批评。“真理报”提出了一定要改正对待中农的错误态度，一定要实行无产阶级与中农坚固联盟，向农村资本主义分子实行进攻。
    在一九三○年六月联共（布）第十六次代表大会开会以前，五月二十一日联共（布）中央公布了第一个五年计划纲要及农业集体化等问题的报告提纲草稿，第二天“真理报”就组织了讨论专页。讨论专页第一期上指出，讨论的目的是帮助党就讨论的几个问题澄清思想、总结经验，使讨论的结果更加丰富党的工作经验，以便进一步从事社会主义建设。苏联共产党的敌人曾企图使党在讨论中更加软弱，但是经过讨论后党是更加坚强了。在讨论专页上发表了不少党员署名的文章，其中有关于这一阶段党内生活上的问题，农业集体化工作中的问题，职工会的任务问题等等。这些文章都是对于联共（布）中央所公布的报告提纲的意见。讨论专页一直出到代表大会开幕为止。联共（布）中央和报告人对专页上所提出的意见都作了考虑。这样的讨论充分发扬了党内民主，发挥了集体意志。这个讨论更标志了党的团结一致，标志了党的总路线的胜利。
    第一个五年计划向布尔什维克党提出了新任务，就是要注意党的组织问题，改善党的工作。苏联国内的阶级情况也要求这样做。苏联共产党必须吸收大量先进工人入党。按列宁的说法，他们是唯一可以直接反对资产阶级的力量。社会主义建设的成就使党的威信大为提高，大量留在党外的同路者要求入党。因此苏联共产党必须采取措施防止小资产阶级混入党内来，因为小资产阶级是曲解党的路线、产生宗派活动和蜕化堕落的社会根源。“真理报”解释党员的条件，宣传要吸收工人阶级的先进分子，这是党的统一和实现党的路线的保证。斯大林同志在一九三四年二月的“真理报”上发表文章，指出：成批的工人要求入党，这说明了党的领导正确，党的政策正确，党的胜利，广大群众相信党的政策。但这不等于把一切愿意加入党的人都吸收入党。党的任务在于个别地把已经历过考验的人吸收入党。“真理报”指出，不但要求数量而且要求质量。“真理报”系统地宣传了扩大党的队伍和提高党员质量的问题，报上设了专栏：“无产阶级把最优秀的分子送入党内来”。
    随着新党员的入党，思想教育工作提到了重要的地位。必须以马克思列宁主义武装新党员，把他们加以锻炼，参加到社会主义建设事业中去。“真理报”系统地进行了党员思想教育工作，号召加强党内生活，发扬党内民主，反对党内的官僚作风。“真理报”把经常报道马克思列宁主义的学习问题，作为反对机会主义和实现社会主义改造的不可缺少的任务。
    二、为开展批评和自我批评
            而斗争
    苏联共产党在实行社会主义全面进攻的同时，大力开展了批评和自我批评。批评和自我批评的口号，是整个无产阶级专政制度的一部分。苏维埃国家是无产阶级专政的国家，苏联共产党是唯一执政的党，因此党只有靠自己来揭露缺点，纠正缺点。批评和自我批评已成为社会主义社会发展的一个动力，依靠它和陈旧的将要死亡的事物作斗争，帮助新生事物的成长。批评和自我批评也是吸引群众参加社会主义建设的好方法。只有让工人和其他劳动人民能直接了当地对党和政府机关工作的缺点和错误进行批评，才能使他们积极地参与国家的建设，提高他们劳动的积极性和创造性。批评对于党的生活有极大的意义，在第一个五年计划时期更有紧迫的意义。联共（布）中央在一九二八年告全体党员、告全体工人书中指出，如果没有自下而上的批评，没有劳动者的积极参加，社会主义建设就成为不可能。苏联共产党要求工人们展开不顾情面的批评，使它成为一个杠杆，依靠它从根本上改造机关工作。为使这种批评不是纸上谈兵，苏联共产党提出了批评“不问对象，不顾情面，自上而下，自下而上”的口号。这也是报纸开展批评和自我批评的口号。
    苏联共产党把开展批评作为教育和培养干部的方法，并与压制批评者进行斗争。“真理报”特别注意开展对官僚主义的批评。“真理报”指出官僚主义是党的敌人之一，这个敌人在机关内和党内都存在着。怎样消灭官僚主义？只有一条道路，即组织自下而上和自上而下的两方面的批评。“真理报”指出，领导者是有经验的，但他只从上面看问题，眼光有限制；千百万劳动群众在社会主义建设中积累着大量经验，但只从下面看问题，也受限制；正确的结论必须是来自两方面的经验的综合。领导者必须有预见，但只有与生活紧紧联系的人才能有预见。同时，只有当千百万群众参加到领导工作中来，才能使错误和缺点在萌芽中即被消除。“真理报”为了发动这种自下而上的批评的浪潮，组织了“工农检查”专页，每周出一期，满版都是批评性的文章。这些稿件是来源于党的监察委员会和苏维埃工农监督局以及广大群众的来信。专页的内容是多样的，它和党的、苏维埃的各方面的缺点作斗争。有时材料集中在一个问题上。如一九二九年二月二十四日集中检查了莫斯科各机关如何接待群众来访的问题；三月二十九日集中检查了各机关如何执行党的指示把工人、农民、妇女干部提拔到领导岗位上来的问题；八月二十日发表了检查第聂伯水电站工程的材料。“真理报”很注意这种批评的成效，因此专页上同时发表上期批评的结果。这对开展自下而上的批评有好处，因为群众亲眼看到了自己批评的效果。
    “真理报”并教育党的干部正确地对待批评。批评是很难使人像受到奖励一样感到愉快的。但是难受是一种保证，使人能更快地改正缺点。党的工作人员既能勇敢地批评别人，也能勇敢地接受别人的批评，这就是正确的布尔什维克的立场。
    三、关于党的组织领导
    苏联共产党在第一个五年计划时期，把培养干部看作是首要的任务。苏联共产党认为必须从工人阶级中培养领导干部，培养能在政治上、生产上领导企业的干部。如果没有这个条件，就不能把落后的俄国变为先进的工业化的国家。当时需要的不是一般的干部，而是需要以较快的速度培养出来的专家和有能力的干部。斯大林同志在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上曾指出：愿意参加和领导建设的干部要多少有多少，但是善于建设和领导的干部却少得不像样子。有些人却还在歌颂自己的无文化，他们认为，一个人没有文化，写的文章文理不通，只要是在车床旁边成长起来的人，就是道道地地的工人，既能得到器重，也能得到提拔。如果你有了文化，知识多起来的时候，就认为你已经脱离了工人阶级的地位了。斯大林同志指出，如果不把这种对待科学和文化的野蛮态度消除，就不能前进一步。他说，苏联并不是需要随便一种工业指挥人材和工程技术人材，需要的是能够了解工人阶级的政策，能领会这个政策，并决意诚恳地把它实现起来的那种人材。因此，工人阶级应当造就它自己的生产技术知识界，即能维护它这个统治阶级在生产中的利益的生产技术知识界。
    当时苏联的经济干部是很少的，虽然大部分技术人员能老老实实地工作，但是部分资产阶级知识分子的上层却在进行暗害活动。而当时一些党的领导干部却看不出来，因为他们不懂技术。顿涅茨矿区的沙赫亭事件，就是资产阶级利用党的经济工作干部的无知所进行的破坏活动。苏联共产党对经济工作干部在沙赫亭事件中所犯的错误，进行了严格的批评，要求当时工厂中的党员厂长一定要加强技术学习，加快掌握技术。没有这种批评和督促，就不能很快培养出党的经济工作干部，就不能很快消灭技术上的落后性。苏联共产党同样对一九三○年在农业集体化运动中犯“左”倾错误的干部进行了批评。集体农庄的干部，正是在这种纠正错误中培养出来的。但是有一些干部还不了解这种需要，仍然学习得很慢。于是苏联共产党和“真理报”把干部问题很尖锐地提出来了，指出布尔什维克必须掌握技术。“真理报”曾发表了论文“是时候了，布尔什维克自己必须成为专家”，又在一九三○年设立了经常的专栏“为干部而斗争”，持续了相当长的时间。“真理报”并特别注意对专门培养经济领导干部的工业学院的报道。
    苏联共产党的组织领导工作中，除了干部问题外，实际生活中又产生了检查对决议的执行情况的问题。沙赫亭事件不光是暴露了干部问题的严重性，而且暴露了某些党组织没有注意对决议执行情况的检查。有一些领导干部只忙于作决议、发指示，却不做具体工作，不接近群众。他们只空喊要发动群众，却不知道如何发动群众，发动了群众干什么。“真理报”批评了这些领导干部。有这样一个区委书记，他要休假了，他把工作交代给副书记，并指示说：“我要休假了，我已准备好了十份决议草案。你可以把集体农庄主席找来谈话，把决议上空着的数字填上去，报告给上级，上级就不会批评我们没有准备春耕了。”这种人虽然不多，却是存在的，可见还有人相信这种空洞决议的魔力。领导干部一定要组织决议的实行，并注意对决议执行情况的检查。“真理报”经常注意报道这方面的问题，不止一次地指出过，应该把检查决议的执行和保证决议实现的问题提高到原则上来认识。
    这就是说，报纸必须教育党的干部树立起正确的布尔什维克的领导作风：要有革命胆量，又要有切实精神；领导要有原则性，工作又要具体而有效率；要发扬首创精神，对新事物要有敏感，要有预见；要朴素谦虚、忠诚老实，联系群众，又要能开展批评和自我批评，保持警惕性。
      四、党组织在经济工作中的
          任务
    为了实现苏联第一个五年计划，就必须加强经济机关的管理工作。但是当时一些经济机关还缺乏管理经济的基本知识，特别是党和经济工作的领导缺乏明确的分工。有的地方，党直接干涉了经济工作，代替了经济领导，这就造成了经济机关中无人负责的现象。另一些地方，经济领导人员又不尊重党的领导，不重视群众的意见。必须消灭这种现象，在企业的领导上建立正常的关系。一九二九年九月，联共（布）中央作出关于改善企业领导和建立一长制的决议，确定了企业行政领导和党的领导的分工，指出直接领导企业的是经济工作人员，党的组织不能代替行政领导。党组织的基本任务是对经济工作和群众的政治领导，培养群众的社会主义觉悟与生产积极性，以保证经济工作任务的完成。这个决议还规定要建立严格的制度。
    “真理报”协助党巩固企业的一长制，发表不少有关企业中党政关系的通讯，说明一长制不是不理睬社会舆论，不要群众，而是应该依靠党的监督，并和工人、技术人员的积极性主动性结合起来。“真理报”重视怎样召开生产会议的问题，发表了不少在党委会上和党的积极分子会上怎样讨论经济问题的文章。同时，“真理报”不但从原则上，而且通过实际工作的事例，说明党、行政组织、工会如何分工，又如何从不同的角度，如行政从生产上，党从政治上，工会从组织竞赛和生活福利问题上，来实现党的总路线。
    但是，有些党组织起初并没有完全领会联共（布）中央的精神，以致出现了一些错误。“真理报”为此进行了反对两种偏向的斗争，指出：党的组织、党的领导人员应毫无例外地关心全面的经济生活，深刻地掌握经济事业，而不要去直接干涉经济业务，因为那是经济工作人员的直接责任。但是这不等于摆脱生产，而是要更多地接近生产，要全面而深刻地掌握经济，不过是要从政治领导的立场出发来对待经济问题。党的领导机关是政治领导机关，是对一切工作决定政治方向的机关。党组织的任务是对经济工作如何掌握党的路线进行监督，对经济工作人员如何实现党的总路线、如何完成国家计划的活动进行监督，并以自己对群众的政治工作来帮助他们，保证经济任务的完成。因此，党组织在领导经济工作时，既要决定方向，实行监督，又要了解实际情况，实行具体领导。在工厂企业里的党组织的领导者应当了解生产，了解管理工作，不过他不应该看不到前途，不应该是看不到政治路线的事务主义者，他应该是政治家。这就是说，他必须善于分析环境，通晓经济生活和经济机构的情况和特点，体察经济与社会生活中的每一个过程和现象，预见其发展，并根据这些来确定工作方针。
    “真理报”教育干部认识到党组织是组织各个组织相互配合的机关，犹如军队的指挥员指挥各种兵种联合协同作战一样。党组织的领导者要教育各方面的干部——苏维埃工作者、经济工作者、工会工作者、青年团工作者、以至文化工作者都关心建设远景，关心总路线，关心工业化的实现，并组织起来相互配合为实现总路线而斗争。党要领导和依靠这些组织来教育群众。报纸要发表有关这方面经验的文章。但是这里不容许把党的政治领导降低到一般的水平，即是把党组织降低到和其他各个组织相平行的协商机构的水平。
    “真理报”教育干部认识到，在党指出了政治方向之后，就一定要把党的政治方向变为实际生活，为实现总路线而斗争。群众政治工作就是党动员和组织全党和广大群众的积极性和创造性，为实现这一任务的有力杠杆之一。群众政治工作的基本方法是组织工厂农村中的宣传鼓动队，由党的领导干部向人民群众作政治报告。“真理报”以自己的报道帮助党组织正确地运用这些形式，批评宣传鼓动和讲演中的缺点，介绍成功的经验；并指出党的宣传工具如广播、电影、剧院等是从政治上、思想上影响群众的强有力的工具，各级报纸也要注意报道这些工作，以不断提高劳动者的觉悟。
    “真理报”为完成社会主义建设第一个五年计划展开了巨大的组织教育工作。因为完成第一个五年计划不仅对苏联有重要意义，而且有重大的国际意义；完成第一个五年计划不仅是苏联人民的事业，而且是国际无产阶级的事业。“真理报”在第一个五年计划完成时出了许多专刊，宣传它的重大意义。在总结第一个五年计划的成就时，“真理报”警惕全体党员不要骄傲，不要因胜利而冲昏头脑。“真理报”指出，党所以获得胜利是因为有正确的路线，是由于党是建立在马克思主义的思想基础之上，因此应忠实于马克思主义学说。苏联工人阶级之所以有力量，还因为有全体农民的支持，因为不断巩固着各民族的友好团结，因此应更加巩固工农联盟，更加巩固和各民族的友好团结。苏联之所以有力量，还因为有国际工人阶级的支持，因此要发扬国际主义精神，更加巩固和各国工人阶级的联系。
    苏联报纸的经验还告诉我们：虽然从一般的意义上说，党的机关报上的每一篇材料都应该是党的生活的材料，都应该是以党的立场、观点和方法来阐明一切社会生活中的现象，指引群众努力的方向；但在报道党内生活，报道党的群众政治工作，教育和团结共产党员，提高党组织的工作水平，并使它们能够更有效地实现对当地国家机关、经济机关工作的政治监督，和在群众中发挥自己的政治与组织的作用等方面，党的生活部又负有特殊的责任。
    联共（布）中央和各级党委是十分注意自己机关报党的生活部的工作状况的。联共（布）中央曾几次作了关于改善中央和地方报纸党的生活部的工作以及如何进行工作的决议，苏联共产党又十分重视对党的生活部的工作人员的挑选与配备，委任具有足够的理论修养、党性锻炼和相当实际生活经验的干部担任党的生活部的工作，以此来不断提高党的生活部工作的马克思列宁主义理论水平、党性修养并密切与实际生活的联系，使之达到党所要求的水平。
