    A Festival of National Unity
    By our reporter Li He
    The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union solemnly celebrated the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia on May 23rd, taking advantage of the day off.
    On this festival of national unity, a military parade and a procession of 500,000 working people were held in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. Delegations from Russia and other republics of the Soviet Union, as well as representatives from the People's Republic of Poland, participated in the review. The marching crowds shouted: "Long live the inseparable unity of the Ukrainian nation, the Russian nation, and all nations of the Soviet Union!" Grand mass entertainment events were organized in Minsk, Kishinev, Riga, Baku, Tashkent, and other republican capitals.
    Moscow—the capital of the Soviet Socialist Republics Union and Russia—was filled with an atmosphere of national friendship. On the wall of the State Department Store on the east side of Red Square, the flags of the sixteen union republics embraced the bas-reliefs of Lenin and Stalin and the "300" symbol, marking the many years of friendship between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. On the wall of the Historical Museum on the north side of Red Square hung the "Bogdan Khmelnitsky" Medal. The museum recently opened an exhibition in five halls showcasing the friendship between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples, which has grown in the common struggle for freedom and independence. All streets were filled with red flags, and in many places, the flag of the Russian Republic (with a blue stripe to the left of the Soviet flag) and the flag of the Ukrainian Republic (with a blue stripe below the Soviet flag) flew side by side. The large characters "300" were hung everywhere in public places. At night, the golden characters "300" woven from lights on major buildings shone far and wide.
    From morning till night, the parks and squares were filled with joyous people. People dressed in light and brightly colored summer clothes came here to enjoy the festival. On this day, open-air entertainment was organized in forty-four squares. Six hundred actors and more than six thousand amateur artists participated in the performances.
    The Gorky Central Park of Culture and Rest, with its lush greenery and rippling river, attracted the most visitors. Young people sang and danced along the riverside paths. Various amusement parks put on a variety of interesting programs. People also saw friendly matches of chess, rowing, weightlifting, and boxing between athletes from Moscow and Ukraine. At three o'clock, a beautiful sports performance began at the Dynamo Stadium. Tens of thousands of people dressed in various colors filled the stadium, resembling three huge wreaths. Comrades Malenkov and Khrushchev sat in the stands. About three thousand male and female athletes from Moscow and Ukraine, in teams of one hundred, paraded around the field. The entire procession was led by the Soviet emblem, and the flags of the Soviet Union, the Russian Republic, and the Ukrainian Republic were held high. Various track and field events were held. Six hundred members of the "Spartak" sports association performed group exercises. The exercises depicted harvesting, blacksmithing, and logging. Then, twenty-two motorcyclists appeared on the sports field. Leading the way was a small motorcycle driven by six-year-old motorcyclist Genia Veriugin. The group exercises performed by seven hundred members of the "Dynamo" sports association were the most spectacular. On the green turf of the sports field, their sky-blue costumes and orderly changing movements flowed like the waves of a blue sea, like the clouds in a blue sky. Various sports associations used group exercises to write the three large characters "300" on the sports field. Finally, a football match was held.
    Sports programs were also held in many other places. At noon, thirty teams of bicycles sped along the Sadovoye Ring Road. This was a competition organized by the "Moscow Oblast Truth" newspaper. A basketball game between Ukrainian and Moscow teams was also held in the Soviet Army Park.
    The linden trees on Lenin Hills are already full of green leaves, and the cherry trees are in bloom. The open-air concert in front of the Moscow University building continued until late at night. Many people came here from afar. People stroll in the open mountain square, enjoying the spring scenery of Moscow during the day and admiring the myriad lights of Moscow at night. Looking back at the Moscow University building illuminated by the sunlight during the day and the lights at night, and listening to the music of national form with socialist content, one cannot help but feel that a communist society is approaching us day by day.

    民族团结的佳节
    本报记者　李何
    苏联全国各族人民在五月二十三日利用休息日隆重地庆祝了乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年。
    在这民族团结的节日，在乌克兰的首都基辅举行了阅兵典礼和五十万劳动群众的游行。参加检阅的有俄罗斯和苏联其他各共和国的代表团以及波兰人民共和国的代表。游行队伍高呼着：乌克兰民族和俄罗斯民族和苏联所有民族不可分裂的统一万岁！在明斯克、基希湼夫、里加、巴库、塔什干和其他各共和国首都都组织了盛大的群众娱乐。
    在莫斯科——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和俄罗斯的首都，充满着民族友好的气氛。在红场东面国营百货公司墙上，十六个加盟共和国的国旗拥着列宁、斯大林的浮雕和标志俄罗斯和乌克兰两民族多年友谊的“300”。在红场北面历史博物馆墙上，挂着“波格丹·赫米尔尼茨基”勋章。博物馆新近以五个厅展览俄罗斯和乌克兰人民在为自由和独立的共同斗争中成长起来的友谊。所有街道插满红旗，许多地方俄罗斯共和国国旗（苏联国旗左方加上蓝条）和乌克兰共和国国旗（苏联国旗下方加上蓝条）并排飘扬着，公共场所遍挂“300”年的大字。夜间，各大建筑物上灯光织成的“300”年金字远远闪耀着。
    从早到晚，各个公园和广场到处是欢乐的人们。穿着夏季浅色和鲜艳的服装的人们来这里消度佳节。这一天，四十四个广场组织了露天娱乐。六百个演员和六千多个业余艺术工作者参加了表演。
    在草木青翠、河水荡漾的高尔基中央文化休息公园，游玩的人们最多。河边路上青年们载歌载舞。各个游艺场表演了多种有兴趣的节目。人们在这里还看到了莫斯科和乌克兰的选手所进行的下象棋、划船、举重和斗拳的友谊比赛。三点钟在狄纳莫体育场开始了健美的体育表演。围绕着体育场坐满穿着各色衣裳的几万群众，宛如三匝巨大的花圈。在看台上坐着马林科夫同志和赫鲁晓夫同志。莫斯科和乌克兰约三千男女运动员一百人一队地绕场一周。整个队伍前列抬着苏联国徽，举着苏联、俄罗斯共和国和乌克兰共和国的国旗。举行了各种田径赛。“斯巴达”体育团体六百人表演了集体操。在体操中表现了收割、打铁和伐木。接着二十二个摩托车手出现在运动场上。领头的是一辆小小的摩托车，它是由六岁的摩托车手根尼亚·维留金驾驶的。“狄纳莫”体育团体七百人的集体操最精彩。在运动场绿茵的草地上，他们的天蓝色服装和整齐变化的动作，像碧海的波浪，像蓝天的云彩一般起伏流动。各体育团体以集体操在运动场上写出“300”三个大字。最后，进行了足球比赛。
    运动的节目还在许多地方举行。中午，沿沙多沃环行道三十队单车风驰而过。这是由“莫斯科州真理报”组织的竞赛。在苏军公园还举行了乌克兰和莫斯科的篮球队比赛。
    列宁山上菩提树已经绿叶满枝，樱桃树正在开花。莫斯科大学大厦面前的露天演奏直继续到深夜。许多人们从远处来到这里。人们在开朗的山上广场优游着，白天饱览了莫斯科的春色，夜间欣眺了莫斯科的万盏灯光，回头来看在白天的阳光和夜间的灯光照耀下的莫斯科大学大厦，聆听着社会主义内容的民族形式的音乐，是怎么也不能不涌起共产主义社会一天天在走近我们的感觉的。五月二十四日
