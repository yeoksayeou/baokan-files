Shenyang City's middle and higher school students, with the exception of a small number of sick and weak students, participated in the preliminary grade training of the Labor-Defense System (i.e., "Preparation for Labor and National Defense" physical education system) in the second semester of 1953. For example, among the more than 9,000 students in the First Middle School, the First Normal School, and two other schools, 8,025 students regularly participated in physical exercise. Recently, the "Joint Directive on Carrying Out Mass Physical Education Activities in Middle and Higher Schools" jointly issued by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government was sent to various schools in Shenyang and was warmly supported by teachers and students. Many schools have conducted research and discussions, and students feel honored to be able to participate in Labor-Defense System training. Currently, more than 2,900 students from nine schools, including the Northeast Institute of Technology, China Medical University, and First Middle School, have organized 188 men's training groups and 87 women's training groups to formally participate in Labor-Defense System training.

    沈阳市中等以上学校学生
    积极参加劳卫制预备级锻炼
    沈阳市三十七个中等以上学校的学生，除少数有病和体弱学生外，在一九五三年下学期都参加了劳卫制（即“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度）的预备级锻炼。如第一中学、第一师范学校等四校九千余名学生中，其中就有八千零二十五名学生经常参加体育锻炼。最近中央人民政府体育运动委员会、中央人民政府高等教育部等单位联合发布的“关于在中等以上学校中开展群众性体育运动的联合指示”发到沈阳市各校时，受到各校师生的热烈拥护。很多学校都进行了研究讨论，同学们以自己能够参加劳卫制的锻炼感到光荣。现在已有东北工学院、中国医科大学、第一中学等九校中的两千九百余名同学，组织一百八十八个男子锻炼小组，八十七个女子锻炼小组正式参加劳卫制的锻炼。
