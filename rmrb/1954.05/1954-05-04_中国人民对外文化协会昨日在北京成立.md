Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: In order to further develop the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the people of all countries and promote cultural exchange, the China Peace Committee, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs jointly initiated the establishment of the "China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries," which was officially established in Beijing on May 3rd.

More than 100 people attended the inaugural meeting, including representatives from national people's organizations and well-known figures from cultural, artistic, scientific, educational, and social circles.

The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee and Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He first announced the official establishment of the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries on behalf of the joint sponsoring organizations. He said that cultural exchange between the Chinese people and the people of all countries is an excellent tradition of our nation. Since the founding of New China, this fine tradition has been further promoted. Guo Moruo said that although we have done a lot of work in this area over the past four years, it still cannot meet the needs of the Chinese and foreign people. The people of all countries urgently demand to understand New China, and more than 20 countries have already established friendship associations or cultural associations with China. We believe that the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries will be able to establish close ties with these organizations and the broad masses of people in various countries to widely exchange culture and enhance the friendship of the people of all countries.

Subsequently, the meeting unanimously adopted the Articles of Association of the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and elected 116 directors and 29 standing directors. At the same time, Chu Tunan was elected as president, Ding Xilin, Yang Hansheng, and Hong Shen as vice presidents, and Chen Zhongjing as secretary-general.

Chu Tunan spoke at the meeting. He said that in the past four years, our people have carried out many foreign cultural exchanges and friendly activities, which have been warmly welcomed by the people of various countries. At the same time, we have also received representatives from many countries to visit our country, which has greatly strengthened the cultural exchange and friendship between our country and other countries. After the establishment of the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the work in this area will be carried out in a more planned and step-by-step manner.

After the inaugural meeting, the Standing Council of the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held its first meeting and approved the working organizations and personnel arrangements.

    中国人民对外文化协会昨日在北京成立
    据新华社三日讯：为进一步发展中国人民和各国人民之间的友好关系，促进文化交流，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中印友好协会、中缅友好协会及中国人民外交学会等人民团体，联合发起筹组的“中国人民对外文化协会”，已于五月三日在北京正式成立。
    出席成立大会的，有全国各人民团体的代表和文化、艺术、科学、教育以及社会各界知名人士等共一百多人。
    大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席、中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若主持。他首先代表联合发起的各团体，宣布中国人民对外文化协会正式成立。他说，中国人民和世界各国人民交流文化，这是我们民族优良的传统。新中国成立以后，这种优良的传统，更进一步得到了发扬。郭沫若说，虽然四年多来，我们在这方面作了许多工作，但是还不能满足中外人民的需要。各国人民迫切要求了解新中国，目前已有二十多个国家成立了对中国的友好协会或文化协会。我们相信，中国人民对外文化协会必能与这些组织和各国广大人民建立密切的联系，以广泛交流文化，增强各国人民的友谊。
    接着，大会一致通过了中国人民对外文化协会简章，推选出理事一百一十六人，常务理事二十九人。同时还推选楚图南为会长，丁西林、阳翰笙、洪深为副会长，陈忠经为秘书长。
    楚图南在大会上讲话。他说，过去四年多以来，我国人民进行了许多对外文化交流和友好的活动，受到各国人民的热烈欢迎。同时，我们也曾接待了许多国家的代表来我国访问，这就大大地加强了我国和各国文化的交流和人民的友谊。中国人民对外文化协会成立后，将使这方面的工作更有计划和有步骤地开展起来。
    成立大会结束后，中国人民对外文化协会常务理事会并举行了第一次会议，通过了工作机构和人事配备。
