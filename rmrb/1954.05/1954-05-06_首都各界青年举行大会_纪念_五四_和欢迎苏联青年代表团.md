Liao Chengzhi's Speech

Dear Comrades:

Today is the fighting festival of Chinese youth with a glorious revolutionary tradition - the "May Fourth" Youth Day. We warmly celebrate our own festival, celebrate the achievements made by Chinese youth in the past year, and congratulate the young men and women of the whole country on better implementing Chairman Mao's call for "good health, good study, and good work," and implementing the instructions given to us by Comrade Zhu De on behalf of the Party Central Committee at the 35th anniversary of the "May Fourth" commemoration. As we commemorate the "May Fourth" Youth Day, we are particularly pleased that the Soviet Youth Delegation led by Comrade Shelepin is visiting our country at this time. They are celebrating the festival with us and bringing the great and profound friendship of Soviet youth. Let us welcome the representatives of the glorious Soviet youth - the Soviet Youth Delegation - with warm brotherly affection and pay them warm and high respect!

Thirty-five years ago, Chinese youth held high the banner of patriotism and fought against imperialism and domestic reactionary forces. After many years of arduous and heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally achieved a victory of great historical significance and established a strong and independent country in Asia. Our predecessors have opened up a path to prosperity and strength for our country and created an infinitely bright future for us young people. The glorious task of our generation of youth is to inherit and develop the cause painstakingly created by our predecessors and build our country into a great socialist country. We must recognize that the task of socialist construction facing us is great and arduous, and it requires us to dedicate all our strength to the cause of socialist construction. Only by relying on our hard work can we create a happier life and build our country into a socialist country with a strong industry. Therefore, we youth must become good laborers and become shock brigades in the cause of socialist construction. Many advanced figures have emerged in the youth ranks on various fronts, and thousands upon thousands of such figures will continue to emerge in the future. Under the close care of the Chinese Communist Party, we young people have ample opportunities to give full play to our talents and have better learning conditions than ever before. Let us live up to the Party's training and trust in us. We young people living in the Mao Zedong era are proud that we regard selfless dedication to the cause of socialist construction as our greatest happiness. We know how to make youth shine brighter and how to make life more meaningful and more in line with the interests of the people.

An important condition for the victorious socialist construction in our country is the increasing strength of the entire peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, the support of peace-loving people all over the world for us, especially the huge and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country. We know that building socialism cannot rely on enthusiasm alone, but must also have knowledge and master advanced science and technology. That is why Chairman Mao's call to learn from the Soviet Union is of particular significance to us young people. Let us learn from the Soviet youth to regard labor as a glorious and heroic cause, and build socialist mansions on the land of our motherland with our labor. Let us learn from the Soviet youth to study tenaciously and make courageous advances towards science. Let us learn from the Soviet youth to be infinitely loyal to the cause of the Party, loyal to the cause of proletarian internationalism, and contribute all our strength to the great cause of building the motherland and defending peace.

We young people cherish friendship and understand the great power generated by friendship. Among all friendships, there is no more sublime friendship than that established between the people of China and the Soviet Union on the basis of internationalism. Let us infinitely strengthen the friendship between our two peoples and youths and become a stronger force in the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. Let us cheer and sing for the great friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union.

Chairman Mao said: "The May Fourth Movement took place under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin." As early as thirty-five years ago, Russia had such a profound influence on China's revolutionary movement and youth movement. Today, as we commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, we see how great changes have taken place in the world. The light of socialism shines on the vast land of our motherland. On our joyful festival, we welcome the spring of the motherland and the Soviet youth friends from afar. This once again shows that no force can hinder the will of mankind to develop friendship and build a new life, and our common cause must advance from victory to victory!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the leader and inspirer of Chinese youth - the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live our dear leader and mentor Chairman Mao!

Shelepin's Speech

Dear Comrades and Friends:

On the great festival of Chinese youth—the May Fourth Youth Day—please allow me, on behalf of the Lenin Communist Youth League and all Soviet youth, to extend warm, fraternal greetings to the heroic youth of free China.

Soviet youth, like all the Soviet people, are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central People’s Government. In a very short period of time, the Chinese people have completed the land reform, restored agriculture and industry, restored the devastated transportation, eliminated inflation, and fundamentally improved the country's economic situation.

The great Chinese people have begun planned national economic construction, and they are enthusiastically working to complete the first five-year plan, laying a solid foundation for the country's industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

During our stay in your country’s capital—Beijing—the Soviet Youth Delegation has personally witnessed the enormous changes that have taken place in recent years. We know that this is just the beginning. Beijing's May Day parade left an unforgettable impression on each of us. We have personally confirmed how closely the Chinese people are united around the Chinese Communist Party, and how full of infinite will the Chinese people are for victory, peace, and happiness.

The great achievements of the People's Republic of China gladden millions of people around the world. The Chinese people have made a great contribution to the cause of peace and democracy for all progressive humanity in the world. New China is a powerful factor for peace and progress in Asia and the world, and a fortress for the oppressed nations of the East in their struggle for freedom, democracy, and national independence.

The myopic discriminatory policies adopted by the American ruling bloc towards the People's Republic of China are bound to suffer shameful failure. We must not ignore the interests of 500 million Chinese people. Progressive humanity around the world is convinced that the legitimate rights of the People’s Republic of China to resolve international issues will be restored.

We are very pleased to see the glorious Chinese youth, led by the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, who are like brothers to us, walking at the forefront of the construction ranks of the new free China.

The Soviet Young Pioneers and youth are extremely concerned about the life, work and study of Chinese youth, and enthusiastically congratulate their every achievement. Soviet youth are very familiar with the names of Chinese youth production innovators and advanced workers: Liu Zhao, the model youth production team leader, Tian Guiying, China’s first female train driver, Wang Chonglun, a youth planer at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Gu Faming, a young miner, Hao Jianxiu, a famous female spinner in Qingdao, and Zheng Xikun, a labor hero, and others.

Today, we warmly salute the young metallurgical workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the steelworkers of Tangshan, the miners of Fushun Coal Mine, the machine-building workers of Shenyang, and the textile workers of Shanghai.

We warmly congratulate the young builders of new factories, schools, mines, oil wells, and powerful power stations, the builders of new railways, and congratulate all those who are heroically carrying out water conservancy construction in the Huaihe and Yongding River basins for their achievements.

Soviet youth are proud that the Chinese people have made many achievements in the transformation of the countryside. We know that the young men and women of China are actively participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and are working selflessly to help accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture. We sincerely congratulate the young laborers in the countryside on their greater achievements in their outstanding and noble work.

We also see how eager Chinese youth are to master knowledge and science. This is a manifestation of Chinese youth's patriotism and their hope to better serve the people and the motherland. We sincerely congratulate Chinese youth on their achievements in learning and in mastering all the treasures of human knowledge.

Chinese youth owe their glorious present and bright future to the Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Eternal and unbreakable friendship unites the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Soviet-Chinese friendship is a powerful force for consolidating world peace. This great friendship is constantly being consolidated and developed. The fraternal ties between the youth of our two great nations are also growing and consolidating. Chinese youth can be confident that Soviet youth will always be their most loyal and tried and tested friends.

Dear comrades and friends, let us congratulate the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on achieving greater success in helping the Chinese Communist Party realize the Party's general line in the transition period, in the struggle for the country's socialist industrialization, and in implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and commerce.

Let us congratulate you on achieving new successes in turning China into a great socialist power and in the struggle for world peace.

Long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

    廖承志的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    今天是有着光荣的革命传统的中国青年的战斗节日——“五四”青年节。我们热烈地庆祝我们自己的节日，庆祝中国青年在过去一年中所得的成就，并祝贺全国男女青年更好地贯彻毛主席的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的号召，贯彻朱德同志在“五四”三十五周年纪念大会上代表党中央给我们的指示。在我们纪念“五四”青年节的时候，我们特别感到高兴的是由谢列平同志率领的苏联青年代表团这时候访问我国，他们和我们在一起欢度节日，带来了苏联青年伟大深厚的友谊。让我们以亲切的兄弟般的情谊，来欢迎光荣的苏联青年的代表——苏联青年代表团，并向他们致热烈的崇高的敬礼！
    在三十五年以前，中国青年高举着爱国主义的旗帜，和帝国主义和国内的反动势力作斗争。经过许多年艰苦英勇的奋斗，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，终于取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利，在亚洲建立了一个强大独立的国家。我们的先辈为我们的国家开辟了走向繁荣富强的道路，为我们青年创造了无限远大光辉的前程。我们这一代青年的光荣的任务，是继承和发展我们先辈艰难缔造的事业，把我们的国家建成一个伟大的社会主义的国家。我们必须认识摆在我们面前的社会主义建设任务是伟大而又艰苦的，它要求我们把自己的一切力量献给社会主义的建设事业。只有依靠我们的辛勤劳动，才能创造更加幸福的生活，才能把我们的国家建设成具有强大工业的社会主义国家。因此，我们青年必须成为好的劳动者，成为社会主义建设事业中的突击队。在青年队伍中，已经在各种战线上涌现了许多的先进人物，今后还将不断地出现千千万万这样的人物。在中国共产党的亲切关怀下，我们青年有着充分发挥自己才能的机会，有着比任何时候都优越的学习条件，让我们不辜负党对我们的培养和信任。我们生活在毛泽东时代的青年引以自豪的，是我们把忘我地献身给社会主义的建设事业看作自己最大的幸福。我们知道怎样使青春放出更大的光彩，怎样使生活过得更有意义，更符合于人民的利益。
    在我国胜利地进行社会主义建设的一个重要条件，是整个和平、民主社会主义阵营的日益强大，全世界爱好和平的人民对我们的支援，特别是苏联对我国巨大无私的援助。我们知道建设社会主义不能只靠热情，还必须有知识，必须掌握先进的科学技术。这就是为什么毛主席提出的学习苏联的号召，对于我们青年有特别重大的意义。让我们学习苏联青年那样把劳动看作光荣、豪迈的事业，用我们的劳动在我们祖国的土地上建设起社会主义的大厦。让我们学习苏联青年那样顽强地进行学习，向科学作勇猛的进军。让我们学习苏联青年那样无限忠诚于党的事业，忠诚于无产阶级国际主义的事业，把自己的一切力量贡献给建设祖国和保卫和平的伟大的事业。
    我们青年是珍贵友谊的，并懂得友谊所产生的伟大力量。在一切的友谊中，没有比中苏两国人民建立在国际主义基础上更崇高的友谊。让我们两国人民和青年的友谊无限地加强起来，成为保卫远东和世界和平事业中更加坚强的力量。让我们为中苏两国青年伟大的友谊欢呼、歌唱。
    毛主席说过：“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。”远在三十五年以前，俄国就给予中国的革命运动和青年运动这样深远的影响。今天纪念五四运动三十五周年的时候，我们看到世界已发生多么大的变化。社会主义的光芒照耀着我们祖国辽阔的土地。在我们欢乐的节日里，我们迎接祖国的春天，迎接来自远方的苏联青年朋友。这又一次说明：人类发展友谊和建设新生活的意志是没有任何力量可以阻挠的，我们的共同的事业一定要从胜利走向胜利！
    中苏两国青年牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！
    中国青年的领导者、鼓舞者——中国共产党万岁！
    我们亲爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
    谢列平的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    在中国青年的伟大节日——五四青年节，请允许我代表列宁共产主义青年团和全体苏联青年向自由中国的英勇的青年致以热烈的、兄弟般的敬礼。
    苏联青年正像全体苏联人民一样，由于伟大的中国人民在共产党和中央人民政府领导下取得了巨大的成绩而感到欢欣鼓舞。中国人民在很短的时期内完成了土地改革，恢复了农业和工业，恢复了遭受破坏的交通运输，消灭了通货膨胀，使国家经济状况得到了根本的好转。
    伟大的中国人民已经开始了有计划的国家经济建设，他们正在为完成第一个五年计划而热情地劳动，正在为国家工业化和农业的社会主义改造打下坚固的基础。
    我们苏联青年代表团在你们祖国的首都——北京停留的几天内，已经亲眼看到了这几年来所发生的巨大变化。我们知道这仅仅是开始。北京的“五一”游行给我们每个人都留下了难忘的印象。我们亲自证实了中国人民如何紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，中国人民如何对胜利、和平和幸福充满着无穷的意志。
    中华人民共和国的巨大成就使全世界千百万的人们感到欢欣鼓舞。中国人民在全世界进步人类争取和平、民主的事业中有着巨大的贡献。新中国是亚洲和全世界的和平与进步的强大因素，是东方被压迫民族在争取自由、民主和民族独立的斗争中的堡垒。
    美国统治集团对中华人民共和国所采取的近视的歧视政策必然要遭到可耻的失败。我们决不能忽视五亿中国人民的利益。全世界进步人类深信中华人民共和国在解决国际问题上的合法权利将得到恢复。
    我们很高兴地看到由中国新民主主义青年团领导的、和我们像兄弟一样的、光荣的中国青年走在新的自由中国的建设队伍的最前列。
    苏联的青年团员和青年极其关心中国青年的生活、工作和学习，并且兴奋地祝贺他们的每一个成就。苏联青年非常熟习中国的青年生产革新者和劳动先进工作者的名字：模范青年生产小组组长——刘钊，中国第一个女火车司机——田桂英，鞍山钢铁公司青年刨工——王崇伦，青年矿工——谷发明，青岛著名纺纱女工——郝建秀，劳动英雄——郑锡坤等人。
    今天，我们热烈地向鞍山钢铁公司的青年冶金工人、唐山的炼钢工人、抚顺煤矿的矿工、沈阳的机器制造工人和上海的纺织工人致热烈的敬礼。
    我们热烈地祝贺新的工厂、学校、矿山、油井和强大的发电站的青年建设者，新的铁路的建设者，祝贺所有在淮河和永定河流域英勇地进行着水利建设的人们获得成就。
    苏联青年因为中国人民在农村的改造中得到了许多成就而感到骄傲。我们知道中国的青年男女正在积极参加互助合作运动，并以忘我的劳动来帮助加速农业的社会主义改造。我们衷心地祝贺农村中的青年劳动者在他们卓越的、崇高的工作中获得更大的成就。
    我们也看到中国青年如何渴望掌握知识和科学。这是中国青年的爱国主义和他们希望能够更好地为人民和祖国服务的一种表现。我们衷心祝贺中国青年在学习中，在掌握人类的全部知识宝藏方面获得成就。
    中国青年把自己的光辉的今天和美好的未来都归功于以毛泽东同志为首的共产党。
    永恒的、牢不可破的友谊把中苏两国人民连结在一起。苏中友谊是巩固世界和平的强大力量。这个伟大的友谊正在不断巩固和发展。我们两大国家的青年之间的兄弟般的联系也在增长和巩固。中国青年可以相信，苏联青年将永远是他们最忠实的和经得起考验的朋友。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，让我们祝贺中国新民主主义青年团在帮助中国共产党实现党在过渡时期总路线的巨大工作中，在争取国家的社会主义工业化，和实行农业和工商业的社会主义改造的斗争中获得更大的成就。
    让我们祝贺你们在使中国变成伟大的社会主义强国和争取世界和平的斗争中获得新的成就。
    中苏两国青年之间的永久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
