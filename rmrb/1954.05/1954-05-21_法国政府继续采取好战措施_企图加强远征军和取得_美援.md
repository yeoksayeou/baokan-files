    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 18th (TASS): According to newspaper reports, the Laniel government is drafting a number of measures to strengthen the French expeditionary force in Indochina and obtain more extensive American military assistance in order to create conditions for continuing the war in Indochina.
    A special military mission headed by French Chief of Staff Ély has been sent to Indochina. According to "France-Soir," this mission is entrusted with delivering new instructions for continued operations and the repositioning of forces to General Navarre, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Indochina. The newspaper went on to point out that Ély's mission will study on the ground the issues of strengthening the French expeditionary force and the "needs for personnel and equipment."
    Paris newspapers widely reported on the Franco-American talks on the Indochina issue that have already begun. The talks began simultaneously in Paris and Washington on May 13th and were later continued by Bidault and Smith in Geneva on the 15th.
    "Le Monde" wrote: The French side believes that the purpose of the Franco-American talks is to determine "what attitude the United States should take if the Geneva Conference does not reach an agreement on the Indochina issue."
    "Le Monde" said: "This primarily refers to at least partially restoring the diplomatic 'position of strength' that had been compromised in some way at the start of the Geneva Conference."
    "France-Soir's" Washington correspondent, Patina, wrote that the American ruling circles expressed dissatisfaction that General Navarre, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Indochina, remained in his post after the fall of Dien Bien Phu without being replaced by a new military leader.
      "Paris Radical News" wrote: "Washington demands that France and its member states make greater military efforts as a condition for the United States to strengthen its aid in Indochina."

    法国政府继续采取好战措施
    企图加强远征军和取得“美援”
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：据报纸消息，拉尼埃政府正在拟订一些加强在印度支那的法国远征军和取得更广泛的美国军事援助的措施，以便为继续进行印度支那战争创造条件。
    以法国总参谋长埃利为首的特命军事使团已被派往印度支那。据“法兰西晚报”报道，这一使团被委托把继续作战和重新配置力量的新指示交给印度支那法军总司令纳瓦尔。该报接着指出，埃利的使团将实地研究关于加强法国远征军和关于“人员和装备需要”的问题。
    巴黎报纸广泛报道已经开始了的关于印度支那问题的法美会谈。会谈于五月十三日在巴黎和华盛顿同时开始，后来又由皮杜尔和史密斯于十五日在日内瓦接着举行。
    “世界报”写道：法国方面认为，法美会谈的目的是要确定“一旦日内瓦会议对印度支那问题没有达成协议”，美国应采取怎样的态度。
    “世界报”说：“这首先指的是至少要部分地恢复日内瓦会议开始时已在某种情况下破产了的外交上的‘实力地位’。”
    “法兰西晚报”驻华盛顿记者帕蒂纳写道，美国统治集团对于印度支那法军总司令纳瓦尔将军在奠边府失守后仍留原职而没有以新的军事首脑代替他，表示不满。
      “巴黎激进新闻”写道：“华盛顿要求法国和它的联邦成员国在军事上作更大的努力，以此作为美国加强在印度支那的援助的条件。”
