Editor's Note: The resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the development of agricultural production cooperatives points out that while running agricultural production cooperatives well, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership over mutual aid teams, and to take care of, help, and patiently educate individual farmers with full enthusiasm and without barriers. Only in this way can we prepare mass experience and leadership backbone for the further development of agricultural production cooperatives. The experience of the Beixutun branch is very good and can be used as a reference for various places.

    The Beixutun Party Branch of Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, pays attention to strengthening the leadership over mutual aid teams and individual farmers through agricultural production cooperatives. In the past two years, the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Beixutun have developed greatly. Now there are one large and one small agricultural production cooperative in the whole village (the large one has 161 households, the small one has 12 households), nine permanent mutual aid teams and one temporary mutual aid team. A total of 268 households in the village are organized, accounting for 83.29 percent of the total number of farm households in the village.

    After correcting the blind and rash advance sentiment last year, the Beixutun Party Branch once had a slack mood, and relaxed the education of farmers on the policy of mutual aid and cooperation. Some of the farmers who withdrew from the cooperative spread dissatisfied remarks everywhere. Landlords and rich peasant elements also took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, which caused ideological confusion among the masses of farmers. Some farmers believed that "Socialism is still early!" and "It is also possible not to participate in mutual aid and cooperation." As a result, some farmers who had already been organized also asked to withdraw from the group and work individually, some mutual aid teams broke up, and some mutual aid teams reduced the number of households. The relationship between agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers was also very uncoordinated. After discovering this situation, the branch immediately convened a branch committee meeting to study it. The branch first examined the mistake of abandoning the leadership of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and put forward a plan and method to strengthen the unity between societies and groups and individual farmers, and gradually attract members of mutual aid teams and individual farmers to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. Then, the branch exposed the conspiracies of landlords and rich peasant elements among the masses. In this way, the relationship between inside and outside the society gradually coordinated. The branch learned a lesson from this that it is necessary not only to lead the agricultural production cooperative well, but also to lead the mutual aid teams and individual farmers together through the agricultural production cooperative.

    The Beixutun Party Branch adopted the method of "unified leadership, dedicated personnel in charge" to ensure the organizational guarantee of the Party's leadership over mutual aid teams. After the expansion of the agricultural production cooperative, of the 43 party members in the whole village, 37 joined the agricultural production cooperative, and 6 were in mutual aid teams. The branch formed these six party members into a party group to strengthen the leadership of this group. Of the ten mutual aid teams in the village, five had party members and the party members were the team leaders. The branch stipulated that mutual aid teams with party members must help a mutual aid team without party members, and the two teams should exchange experiences frequently. The branch also designated five branch committee members to be responsible for leading ten mutual aid teams, and drove individual farmers forward through mutual aid teams. The branch committee also stipulated that it would study mutual aid and cooperation issues every seven days.

    The Beixutun Party Branch promoted the production of mutual aid teams and individual farmers and strengthened the connection between societies, groups, and individual farmers through labor competitions, evaluations, and field demonstrations. When sanding and improving the soil, the branch mobilized agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to carry out labor competitions. The agricultural production cooperative gave the red flag awarded to them by the county to the mutual aid team as a mobile red flag for the labor competition. At the beginning of this year, the Cao Pifu mutual aid team had more sand filling, a sound system within the team, and high production morale of the members, so they won the red flag. In March, the Ma Laowu mutual aid team did better in production, and the red flag was taken away by them again. This enthusiastic labor competition also drove the production of individual farmers. The branch also regularly organized mutual aid team members and individual farmers to visit the high-yield land of the agricultural production cooperative, and invited the cadres of the agricultural production cooperative to impart advanced technology to the mutual aid teams and individual farmers on the spot. In order to ensure high yield in the whole village, the branch formulated a plan to improve technology, organized members of agricultural production cooperatives, members of mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to study and discuss, so that everyone understood the importance of using advanced technology to ensure high yield, and carried out the work of sanding and improving the soil in the whole village. The branch also established a technical research committee with the agricultural production cooperative as the main body, absorbing members of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and regularly carried out technical experience exchange and imparting. At the beginning of March this year, the technical research association introduced to everyone the method of building toilets and pigpens for accumulating fertilizer in agricultural production cooperatives. The branch also led agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to carry out larger-scale agricultural infrastructure construction together. Last year, the agricultural production cooperative and the mutual aid teams and individual farmers built a branch canal in the Dehe Canal. The agricultural production cooperative benefited from 170 mu of land, and the mutual aid teams and individual farmers benefited from 130 mu of land.

    When the spring plowing and sowing began this year, some mutual aid teams and individual farmers lacked livestock. The branch suggested that the agricultural production cooperative convene a society affairs committee to study how to help these mutual aid teams and individual farmers solve the problem of livestock difficulties. The meeting decided that the agricultural production cooperative should allocate a part of the labor and livestock power to help mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The agricultural production cooperative also discussed with all the members and appropriately reduced the wages of the cattle plough, and at the same time decided that the mutual aid teams and individual farmers who could not afford the wages at that time could postpone the repayment. Last autumn harvest, the whole village suffered a flood disaster, and the farmers' production morale was low. The branch called on party members and members to lead mutual aid teams and individual farmers to rush to harvest Chinese yams and rush to harvest the flooded hemp and naked oats; and mobilized all party members and cadres of agricultural production cooperatives to visit the disaster-stricken farmers household by household, and finally stabilized the masses' production morale and overcame the disaster. The whole village increased production by about 15% compared with 1952. Farmers outside the society responded very well to the help of the agricultural production cooperative. For example, the members of the Xu Zhanlong mutual aid team said: "The agricultural production cooperative is the big brother of our mutual aid team. The agricultural production cooperative really cares about us. We should be close to the agricultural production cooperative." Later, the whole group joined the agricultural production cooperative. More than 30 individual farmers who received assistance from the agricultural production cooperative all felt the warmth of the agricultural production cooperative. They said: "If it weren't for the agricultural production cooperative to help us, hiring other people's cattle ploughs would cost more money, and the land would not be cultivated well." When the agricultural production cooperative was expanded this year, all but four households joined the agricultural production cooperative. Xu Shenkuan and Xu Shengde, who left the society and worked individually last year, had difficulties in production and life. The agricultural production cooperative helped them solve the difficulties, and this year they rejoined the society.

    Although the branch led the mutual aid teams last year and achieved great results, it did not adopt the method of typical demonstration due to the average use of power, and because there were too many mutual aid teams, the branch was too busy to discover and solve some problems in time. Last year, during the autumn harvest, six mutual aid teams broke up because the problem of seizing moisture was not solved. This year, the agricultural production cooperative has expanded, and most of the party members have joined the agricultural production cooperative, and there are fewer leading backbones of the mutual aid teams. Under this circumstance, the branch decided to cultivate typical models for demonstration and consolidate and improve the existing mutual aid teams. The branch cultivated the Ma Laowu and Cao Pifu mutual aid teams as typical models, and designated branch committee members Yang Qi to specifically help the Ma Laowu mutual aid team, and Yan Penggui to help the Cao Pifu mutual aid team. This spring, the branch learned that the biggest problem facing the current mutual aid teams is that they cannot do a good job in scoring and calculating work, so it asked the Cao Pifu mutual aid team to learn the method of calculating work using work tickets in agricultural production cooperatives. After the Cao Pifu mutual aid team implemented the method of calculating work using work tickets, the Zhao Cunfa and Xu Fu mutual aid teams also adopted this method of calculating work. The branch also asked the Ma Laowu mutual aid team to learn the method of calculating work using work books in agricultural production cooperatives. When awarding prizes in March, Ma Laowu introduced this experience to the mutual aid teams, and five mutual aid teams also adopted this method.

    中共北徐屯支部通过农业生产合作社
    加强对互助组和单干农民的领导
    李廷选、刘正国、陈正宪
    编者按：中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中指出，在办好农业生产合作社的同时，必须加强对互助组的领导，并且要满腔热情地、没有隔阂地去照顾、帮助和耐心地教育单干农民。只有这样，才能为进一步发展农业生产合作社准备群众经验和领导骨干。北徐屯支部的经验很好，可供各地参考。
    山西省阳高县北徐屯党支部注意通过农业生产合作社加强对互助组和单干农民的领导。两年来，北徐屯的互助合作组织有很大的发展。现在全屯有大小农业生产合作社各一个（大的有一百六十一户，小的有十二户），常年互助组九个和临时互助组一个。全村组织起来的共有二百六十八户，占全村总农户的百分之八十三点二九。
    北徐屯党支部在去年纠正盲目冒进情绪后，曾一度发生了松劲情绪，放松了对农民进行互助合作政策的教育。一部分退社的农民又到处散布着不满的言论。地主、富农分子也乘机造谣破坏。因而引起农民群众思想的混乱。部分农民认为“社会主义还早哩！”“不参加互助合作也可以”。于是，有些已组织起来的农民也要求退组单干，有的互助组散伙了，有的互助组的户数减少了。农业生产合作社与互助组与单干农民的关系也很不协调。支部发现这种情况后，立即召开支部委员会会议进行研究。支部首先检查了放弃对互助组和单干农民领导的错误，并提出了加强社、组之间和单干农民的团结，和逐步吸引互助组组员和单干农民参加农业生产合作社的计划和办法。接着，支部又在群众中揭发了地主、富农分子的阴谋活动。这样，社内外关系逐渐协调起来。支部由此得出了一个教训，不但要领导好农业生产合作社，并且要通过农业生产合作社带领互助组和单干农民一同前进。
    北徐屯党支部采取了“统一领导、专人负责”的办法，使党对互助组的领导有了组织保证。农业生产合作社扩大后，全村四十三个党员，三十七个加入了农业生产合作社，六个在互助组。支部就把这六个党员，编成一个党的小组，加强对这个小组的领导。全村十个互助组，有五个有党员并且是党员当组长，支部就规定有党员的互助组必须帮助一个没党员的互助组，两个组要经常交流经验。支部还指定了五个支部委员分工负责领导十个互助组，并通过互助组带动单干农民前进。支委会又规定了每七天研究一次互助合作问题。
    北徐屯党支部通过劳动竞赛、评比、田间观摩等活动，推动了互助组和单干农民的生产，加强了社、组和单干农民之间的联系。在垫砂改良土壤时，支部发动农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民开展了劳动竞赛。农业生产合作社把县里奖给他们的一面红旗送给互助组，作为劳动竞赛的流动红旗。今年开春时，曹丕福互助组垫砂多，组内制度健全，组员生产情绪高涨，就夺去了红旗。三月份马老伍互助组的生产搞得更好，红旗又被他们夺去。这种热烈的劳动竞赛也带动了单干农民的生产。支部还经常组织互助组员和单干农民参观农业生产合作社的丰产地，并请农业生产合作社的干部当场给互助组、单干农民传授先进技术。为了保证全村丰产，支部制定了改进技术的方案，组织农业生产合作社社员、互助组组员和单干农民，进行学习讨论，使大家明确了运用先进技术对保证丰产的重要意义，在全村开展了垫砂改良土壤的工作。支部又以农业生产合作社为主，吸收互助组组员、单干农民成立了技术研究委员会，经常进行技术经验的交流和传授。今年三月初技术研究会向大家介绍了农业生产合作社修建厕所、猪圈积肥的办法。支部还领导农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民一起进行较大规模的农业基本建设。去年农业生产合作社和互助组、单干农民在德合渠修了一道支渠，农业生产合作社受益土地一百七十亩，互助组和单干农民受益土地一百三十亩。
    今年春耕播种开始时，有些互助组和单干农民缺乏牲口。支部就建议农业生产合作社召开社务委员会，研究如何帮助这些互助组和单干农民解决牲口困难问题。会上决定农业生产合作社调剂出一部分劳力和畜力帮助互助组和单干农民。农业生产合作社并经全体社员讨论，适当地降低了牛犋的工资，同时决定当时出不起工资的互助组和单干农民，可以延期归还。去年秋收时，全村遭了涝灾，农民生产情绪低落，支部就号召党员和社员带领互助组和单干农民，突击捞山药和抢收被水泡的葫麻和莜麦；并发动全体党员和农业生产合作社的干部逐户慰问受灾农民，终于安定了群众的生产情绪，战胜了灾情，全村比一九五二年增产百分之十五左右。社外农民对于农业生产合作社的帮助反映很好。如徐占龙互助组的组员们说：“农业生产合作社是咱互助组的老大哥，农业生产合作社对咱真关心，咱们应当靠近农业生产合作社。”后来这个组全组加入了农业生产合作社。三十余户得到农业生产合作社帮助的单干农民，都感到农业生产合作社的温暖，他们说：“要不是农业生产合作社帮助咱们，雇别人的牛犋，钱出得多，地还耕不好。”今年扩大农业生产合作社时，除四户没加入外，其余都加入了农业生产合作社。去年出社单干的徐生宽、徐生德生产和生活上都有困难，农业生产合作社就帮助他们解决了困难，今年他们又重新入了社。
    去年支部领导互助组虽然获得了很大的成绩，但由于平均使用力量而没有采用典型示范的办法，加上互助组较多，支部忙不过来，有些问题就不能及时发现和解决。去年秋收当中因为抢墒问题没有解决，就有六个互助组散伙。今年农业生产合作社扩大了，多数党员参加了农业生产合作社，互助组的领导骨干更少了。在这种情况下，支部决定培养典型进行示范，巩固与提高现有互助组。支部培养马老伍、曹丕福互助组为典型，并指定支部委员杨启专门帮助马老伍互助组，阎捧贵帮助曹丕福互助组。今春，支部了解到当前互助组最大的问题是搞不好评分计工，就让曹丕福互助组学习农业生产合作社使用工票制的计工办法。曹丕福互助组实行了工票制的计工办法后，赵存发和徐富互助组也都采用了这种计工办法。支部还让马老伍互助组学习了农业生产合作社的记工表的计工办法。在三月份评奖时，由马老伍向各互助组介绍了这个经验，有五个互助组也采用了这个办法。
