Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency, 6th: The Lao Resistance Government issued a statement on the Geneva Conference on the 5th. The full text is as follows:

    The Geneva Conference has the responsibility of resolving the issue of restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of guaranteeing the national rights and interests of the people of Indochina. Since 1945, the Lao people have risen to fight to defend their urgent aspirations—peace, independence, unity, and democracy. In the course of the struggle, the Lao people established the Resistance Government. The Lao Resistance Government has led the people to unite and fight against imperialist aggression, and has carried out many democratic reforms. Now half of the country, with a population of over one million, has been liberated. The Lao Resistance Government has extremely broad prestige and influence throughout the country. In March of this year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao Resistance Government issued a statement welcoming the Berlin Conference's resolution on convening the Geneva Conference. In order to achieve the goal of restoring peace throughout Indochina at the Geneva Conference, the Lao Resistance Government believes that it is necessary to send its own representatives to participate in the Geneva Conference. The Lao Resistance Government officially declares that the Geneva Conference must accept our request in order to effectively resolve the issues of ceasefire and restoration of peace within Laos.

    Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency, 6th: The Khmer Resistance Government issued a statement on the 3rd regarding the necessity of the Khmer Resistance Government sending representatives to participate in the Geneva Conference. The full text is as follows:

    The Geneva Conference has the important task of restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights and interests of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Like the Lao and Vietnamese peoples, the Khmer people hope for peace, unity, independence, and democracy. For several years, the Khmer people have been closely united with the Vietnamese and Lao peoples, and have carried out a heroic struggle to realize this aspiration. The Khmer people have established the Resistance Government and have led the people in a long-term struggle. The Khmer Resistance Government has given the people various democratic rights, and the Khmer people believe that only the Khmer Resistance Government is their representative. The Khmer people and the Resistance Government are willing to resolve the issues of ending the war and restoring peace through peaceful consultation on the basis of recognizing the national rights and interests of the Khmer people. This aspiration is in line with the aspirations of the people of Indochina, the people of Asia, and the people of the world. The Khmer people and the government welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference, but in order to ensure that the conference achieves the expected results, the Khmer Resistance Government declares: the official representatives of the Khmer Resistance Government should participate in the Geneva Conference.
                  Sơn Ngọc Minh, Chairman of the Khmer Resistance Government, May 3, 1954
