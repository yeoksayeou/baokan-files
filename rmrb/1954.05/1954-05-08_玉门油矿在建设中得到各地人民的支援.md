The construction of Yumen Oilfield, China's first petroleum industrial base, has received strong support from people across the country. Thousands upon thousands of tons of various products from Anshan Iron and Steel – seamless steel pipes, welded pipes, steel plates, channel steel, etc. – have been transported to the mining area. Machinery and equipment from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kunming, and other places, chemical industrial products from Nanjing and other places, and general industrial products from Xi'an are all continuously being transported to the mining area. Many valuable resources from Gansu Province, such as barite and crucible clay, have also been supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of oilfield construction. The workers building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are also accelerating construction to support the oilfield.

The local farmers are also actively supporting the construction of the oilfield. The Ren Guofu mutual aid team of Beitong Township, Yongdeng County, wrote in a letter to the petroleum workers: "In the past, half of the families in our village could not afford lamps and went to bed as soon as it got dark; because you produced a large amount of kerosene, now every household in the village has kerosene lamps, and the rooms are bright at night. Young people study culture under the lamp, women sew clothes under the lamp, and old people talk about the past and present and smoke their pipes, which is very pleasant." Therefore, they are willing to increase grain production to support the construction of the oilfield. Farmers in Jiuquan Prefecture sent representatives to visit the oilfield during the Spring Festival. After they returned, they made a guarantee: "We will provide the manpower and the grain needed, and we will fully support the construction of the oilfield."

    玉门油矿在建设中得到各地人民的支援
    我国第一个石油工业基地——玉门油矿，在建设中得到各地人民的大力支援。鞍钢各种产品——无缝钢管、焊管、钢板、槽钢等，成千成万吨地运到了矿区。上海、广州、昆明等地的机具、机器设备，南京等地的化学工业品，西安的一般工业品，都源源不断地运到矿区。甘肃省许多贵重资源如重晶石、坩子土等，也大量地供应了油矿建设的需要。修建兰新铁路的工人们，也正为支援油矿的建设加速施工。
    当地的农民也在积极支援油矿的建设。永登县北通乡任国富互助组给石油工人的信中写道：“过去我们村子有一半人家点不起灯，天一黑就睡觉；因为你们生产了大量的煤油，现在村子里家家户户点上了煤油灯，晚上屋里都是亮堂堂的，年青人在灯下学文化，妇女们在灯下缝衣服，老年人谈古今、抽旱烟，都非常愉快。”因此，他们都愿增产粮食支援油矿的建设。酒泉地区的农民在春节时派代表参观了油矿，他们回去后提出了保证：“要人有人，要粮有粮，一定全力支援油矿的建设。”
