Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 15th. Lei Renmin, advisor to the Chinese delegation attending the Geneva Conference, spoke to about 150 reporters from various countries at the Richemont Hotel here on the morning of the 15th, describing the tremendous progress China has made in economic construction and foreign trade since liberation.

Foreign reporters had requested the Chinese delegation to provide information about China over the past three weeks. Lei Renmin gave this talk in response to those requests.

Many questions raised by the reporters during the talk reflected the growing concern in Europe and Asia regarding trade with China. Lei Renmin answered all the questions and pointed out: "The People's Republic of China has consistently advocated the restoration and development of commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of any foreign country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."

After listing the figures for China's foreign trade volume, Lei Renmin said: "China's foreign trade volume in 1953 increased more than fivefold compared to 1949, creating the highest record since 1930." He said that China had established formal trade contacts with the governments or industrial and trade circles of twenty-five countries in the past four years. He said: "Trade between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies has greatly expanded."

Lei Renmin pointed out that despite the U.S. "embargo," the trend of trade between China and capitalist countries is still upward. He then said: "A large number of manufacturers and entrepreneurs in capitalist countries" have realized that "embargoes" and economic discrimination against China will only increase their own economic difficulties, and therefore they generally demand to trade with China.

Lei Renmin said: "I believe that if there are no artificial obstacles, trade between Western European countries and China will undoubtedly have further development."

Lei Renmin pointed out that the trade agreements between China and India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Burma are "good examples of developing economic relations between Asian countries." He said: "If the artificial trade barriers imposed on many Asian countries can be eliminated, I believe that trade between our country and various Asian countries—including Japan—will have great expansion."

He went on to say: "In our opinion, there is great potential for continued expansion of trade between China and Egypt and Middle Eastern countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 16th. Moscow's major newspapers on the 16th all published news about the Chinese delegation to the Geneva Conference holding a press conference, with Lei Renmin, advisor to the Chinese delegation, introducing China's economic development and foreign trade situation.

    我国代表团顾问雷任民向记者发表谈话
    介绍我经济建设和对外贸易情况
    【新华社日内瓦十五日电】出席日内瓦会议的我国代表团顾问雷任民十五日上午在这里的里什蒙饭店向许多国家的约一百五十名记者叙述我国从获得解放以来在经济建设和对外贸易方面取得的巨大进步。
    外国记者们在过去三星期中曾要求我国代表团介绍关于中国的情况，雷任民就是应外国记者们的要求发表谈话的。
    记者们在谈话中提出的许多问题，反映了欧洲和亚洲愈来愈关心对中国的贸易问题。雷任民答复了所有的问题，并指出：“中华人民共和国一贯主张在平等与互利的基础上恢复和发展与任何外国的政府和人民之间的商务和贸易关系。”
    雷任民在列举了我国对外贸易额的数字后说：“中国在一九五三年的对外贸易额比一九四九年增加了五倍以上，创造了一九三零年以来的最高纪录。”他说，中国在过去四年中与二十五个国家的政府或工业和贸易界人士建立了正式的贸易联系。他说：“中国与苏联和各人民民主国家之间的贸易有很大扩展。”
    雷任民指出，尽管美国实行“禁运”，中国与资本主义国家之间的贸易的趋势仍然是上升着的。他接着说：“资本主义国家的大批制造商和企业家”已经认识到，“禁运”和对中国的经济歧视只会增加他们自己的经济困难，因此他们普遍要求与中国进行贸易。
    雷任民说：“我相信，要是没有人为的障碍，西欧国家和中国之间的贸易无疑会有进一步的发展。”
    雷任民指出中国与印度、锡兰、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚和缅甸之间的贸易协定是“发展亚洲国家之间的经济关系的良好榜样。”他说：“如果加在许多亚洲国家身上的人为的贸易障碍得以消除的话，我相信，我国与各亚洲国家——包括日本在内——之间的贸易将会有很大的扩展。”
    他接着说：“在我们看来，继续扩展中国和埃及与中东国家之间的贸易是具有很大的可能性的。”
    【新华社莫斯科十六日电】十六日莫斯科各主要报纸都刊载了我国出席日内瓦会议代表团举行记者招待会，我代表团顾问雷任民介绍我国经济发展及对外贸易情况的消息。
