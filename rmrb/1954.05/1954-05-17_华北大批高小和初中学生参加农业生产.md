Large Numbers of Elementary and Junior High School Students in North China Participate in Agricultural Production

In North China, a large number of graduating senior elementary school students and junior high school students have already joined agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Ji County, Hebei Province, according to incomplete statistics, more than 1,700 graduating senior elementary school students and junior high school students have participated in agricultural production in the past two years. In Shuo County, Shanxi Province, 350 primary school graduates participated in agricultural production last year.

After joining agricultural production, most of these students have become activists in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Some have also served as presidents, accountants, technicians, health workers, and cultural instructors in agricultural production cooperatives. In Ji County, Hebei Province, more than 120 graduating senior elementary school students and junior high school students are working as accountants in agricultural production cooperatives. After the establishment of the Nansha River Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, the financial management was chaotic, and the cooperative members had many complaints. The cooperative sent junior high school student Wu Mingliang to the province for accounting training. After fifty days of study, he returned to the village and used the new method of bookkeeping, which was fast and clear. The cooperative members praised him highly, and the chaotic financial situation in the cooperative improved. Qiao Liguang, the vice president of the famous Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, is a graduate of senior elementary school. He now controls the cooperative's production, is responsible for formulating production plans, drawing production charts, dividing cultivation areas, and leading cooperative members to study scientific and technological knowledge. He has become an important backbone of the cooperative. Zhang Wenyu, a graduating senior elementary school student from Jingsheng Village, Lingshi County, Shanxi Province, who participated in agricultural production, learned how to use new-style farm tools from the "Peasant's Daily" and took the lead in trying out plowing, which enabled the popularization of new-style walking plows in the whole village.

After participating in production, the students received education and training in actual work and labor, recognized the broad prospects of agricultural production, felt the glory of participating in the construction of a new socialist countryside, and their enthusiasm for labor became even higher. For example, five graduating senior elementary school students in the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative who learned to drive tractors followed the tractors all day long and became more and more enthusiastic. Zhang Lizhong, a junior high school student from Yangxing Village, Linjin County, Shanxi Province, served as the president of an agricultural production cooperative and worked very hard. He often said: "As long as everyone works harder, socialism will be realized sooner." Many students have improved their political consciousness in actual work and labor and have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Some have also served as leaders of the Youth League branch. Twenty-three young students participating in agricultural production in the eighth district of Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, have joined the Youth League, and three have joined the Party.

The young students who participated in labor production were cared for by the Communist Party, the People's Government, and loved by the masses, and those with excellent results were commended. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League commended Youth League members Zhang Lizhong, Ma Kuai, Wu Mingliang, and Yang Jishan. Some farmers called the young students who actively labored "all-rounders in both literacy and martial arts." In the general election, some students participating in agricultural production were elected as people's representatives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北大批高小和初中学生参加农业生产
    华北各地已有大批高级小学毕业生和初级中学学生参加农业生产和互助合作组织。河北省蓟县近两年参加农业生产的高小毕业生和初中学生，据不完全统计就有一千七百多人。山西省朔县去年有三百五十多名小学毕业生参加了农业生产。
    这批学生参加农业生产以后，大部分已成为农业生产合作社和互助组中的积极分子。有的并担任了农业生产合作社的社长、会计、技术员、卫生保健员、文化教员等职务。河北省蓟县高小毕业生和初中学生在农业生产合作社里当会计的就有一百二十多名。山西省太谷县南沙河村农业生产合作社建立后，财务管理混乱，社员意见很多。社里就派初中学生吴明亮到省里去受会计训练。他经过五十天的学习，回村后用新法记账，又快又清楚，社员都很称赞，社里财务混乱情况也好转了。著名的河北省饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社的副社长乔利广是高小毕业生，他现在掌握全社的生产，负责制订生产计划，画生产图表，划分耕作区，并领导社员学习科学技术知识，已成为社内的重要骨干。山西省灵石县静升村参加农业生产的高小毕业生张文玉学习了“农民报”上新式农具使用法，首先带头试犁，使新式步犁在全村得以推广。
    学生们参加生产后，在实际工作和劳动中得到教育和锻炼，认识了农业生产的远大前途，感觉到参加建设社会主义的新农村的光荣，劳动热情更加高涨了。如耿长锁农业生产合作社学开拖拉机的五个高小毕业生，整天跟着拖拉机转，越学越起劲。山西省临晋县杨杏村初中学生张立忠担任了农业生产合作社的社长，工作非常努力，他常常说：“只要大伙多加一把劲，社会主义就会早一天实现。”不少学生在实际工作和劳动中提高了政治觉悟，光荣地参加了中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团，有的还担任了团支部的领导工作。河北省宣化县八区参加农业生产的青年学生，已有二十三人入了团，三人入了党。
    参加劳动生产的青年学生都受到共产党、人民政府的关怀和群众爱护，成绩优良的并得到表扬。青年团山西省委表扬了青年团员张立忠、马蒯、吴明亮、杨计山等。有些农民称积极劳动的青年学生是“文武双全的能手”。在普选当中，有些参加农业生产的学生被选为人民代表。（新华社）
