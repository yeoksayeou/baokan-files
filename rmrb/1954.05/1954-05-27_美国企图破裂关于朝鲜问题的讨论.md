    Indications now suggest that the United States, disregarding the significant efforts made by the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the 22nd to peacefully resolve the Korean question, is attempting to rupture the discussions on the Korean issue.

    Observers here particularly point to a piece of information revealed by British sources. This information says that the United States and its allies will hold a secret meeting to decide on the issue of completely breaking off the negotiations. The message states that U.S. representative Smith may issue a statement declaring that if the peace-loving democratic countries are not prepared to make any concessions, the negotiations on the Korean question should be broken off.

    In addition to this, after China and North Korea put forward new proposals on the 22nd, a U.S. spokesman immediately estimated that the meeting would only be held one or two more times. Subsequently, South Korea's Byun Young-tae announced at a press conference on the 24th that he refused to establish a neutral nations supervisory commission to oversee elections throughout Korea, and demanded that United Nations supervision of the elections be a condition for progress in the meeting. These have been widely regarded as indications that the U.S. side intends to reject consultation and rupture negotiations.

    Observers here point out that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal has received a good response from public opinion, and the mood for reaching an agreement is growing. This makes the United States, which seeks to maintain tensions in Korea, feel uneasy. At the same time, discussions on the Indochina issue, thanks to the efforts of democratic countries, have made progress, and specific discussions on military issues have begun this week. The United States attempts to poison the entire atmosphere of the Geneva Conference and affect discussions on the Indochina issue by undermining discussions on the Korean question.

    Discussions on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference have now lasted a full month. The progress of the conference shows that the proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il on April 27 and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on May 22, which are supported by China and the Soviet Union, can fully serve as a basis for reaching an agreement. In the process of discussing Nam Il's proposals, many countries, including some of the United States' allies, have agreed to or approached certain principles put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal has further promoted the convergence of opinions from all sides. An agreement should be possible based on these consistent or near-consistent opinions. However, the crux of the problem is that the United States has been deliberately undermining and obstructing the process with an extremely stubborn attitude. As long as people analyze the main principles for resolving the Korean question put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il and the opinions of all parties, it is not difficult to see who should be held responsible for obstructing the reaching of an agreement.

    Foreign Minister Nam Il proposed that the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea must be handled by the Korean people themselves, without any foreign interference. During the discussion process, no one dared to openly oppose this principle, except for the extremely shameless South Korean representative. However, the United States insisted on the illegal resolutions of the United Nations, insisting that the United Nations should interfere in Korea's internal affairs in accordance with this illegal resolution and that the United Nations should reunify Korea. In fact, it was precisely because the United Nations allowed the United States to use its name to interfere in Korea's internal affairs that led to the division of North and South Korea and allowed the United States to dare to launch a war of aggression. In the three-year war, the United States, flying the flag of the United Nations, failed to overcome the resistance of the Korean people and force them to accept the illegal resolutions of the United Nations. The United States is now attempting to impose something that it knows the Korean people will never accept on the Korean people, which shows that it does not actually want to peacefully reunify Korea, but is deliberately creating a stalemate in the meeting so that the Syngman Rhee group can continue to use the name of the United Nations to implement its adventurous plan of "unifying by advancing north" with the support of the United States.

    Foreign Minister Nam Il suggested that in order to establish a unified government of Korea, elections should be held throughout Korea on the basis of the free will of all Korean residents. This reasonable proposal was resolutely opposed by the United States and the Syngman Rhee group. For more than three weeks at the beginning of the meeting, they insisted on following the illegal resolutions of the United Nations, only electing a group of members in North Korea under the supervision of the United Nations to participate in the South Korean parliament. However, this unreasonable proposition did not even receive sympathy among the United States' allies. Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries all advocated that free elections should be held throughout Korea, but they echoed the United States' opinion on the following point: that the elections should be supervised by the United Nations, which is a belligerent party in Korea. However, they also stated that this supervision could be carried out by neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War. French representative Bidault said on May 13: "In order for these elections to be considered valid, the conditions of freedom of expression of public opinion must be reviewed and certified by observers from neutral countries with sufficient qualifications." British representative Eden also said on the same day: The countries monitoring the elections "do not necessarily have to be those that participated in the Korean War, but can be some countries acceptable to the participants of this conference."

    Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's suggestion that neutral countries supervise the elections has brought the opinions of all parties on the issue of supervising the elections very close. However, the United States immediately incited the Syngman Rhee group to put forward the so-called fourteen-point "proposal," still insisting that the elections must be supervised by the United Nations. Although this "proposal" had to agree to hold elections throughout Korea under the pressure of public opinion, according to the conditions attached to it for the United Nations to supervise the elections, the same election farce that was staged on May 20 would be repeated in South Korea, retaining Syngman Rhee's "president," "constitution," and army. As a result, North Korea is still being forced to elect a group of members under the supervision of the United Nations to join the South Korean parliament. Therefore, the United States and the Syngman Rhee group have not actually retreated from their unreasonable demands.

    Foreign Minister Nam Il suggested that all foreign troops should withdraw as soon as possible before elections are held throughout Korea. Except for the United States and the Syngman Rhee group, almost no one publicly opposed the principle of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea. Although many of the United States' allies could not escape the boundaries set by the United States, saying that troops should not be withdrawn too early, they had to express their hope to withdraw their troops from Korea. Even the United States later had to pretend to agree to withdraw its troops, but the condition it required was after Korea was unified and with the approval of the United Nations. This shows that it attempts to occupy Korea indefinitely, using its troops to support the Syngman Rhee group in the elections and to support the Syngman Rhee group in "unifying" the entire Korea. Moreover, the United States unreasonably demanded that the Chinese People's Volunteers, who assisted the Korean people in resisting American aggression, withdraw one month before the elections. This is obviously so that the United States can use any excuse to assist the Syngman Rhee group in launching a new aggression against North Korea.

    Foreign Minister Nam Il also suggested that countries with the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East should guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. No one opposes this point. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have expressed their willingness to participate in this guarantee. British representative Eden also acknowledged in his speech on May 13 that Korea's "independence must be protected by appropriate guarantees from other countries." The United States has been avoiding this issue until the end, when Byun Young-tae came out to suggest that the United Nations should provide guarantees. If this point is linked to Byun Young-tae's entire proposal, it can be seen that the so-called United Nations guarantee is not to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, but only to guarantee the United States' colonial rule in Korea. The resolution illegally passed by the United Nations on October 7, 1950, is such a "guarantee."

    It can be seen from this that the United Nations' illegal resolutions on the Korean question have become the omnipotent magic weapon used by the United States to block all roads to agreement. However, although this magic weapon may enable the United States to achieve its goal of undermining negotiations, it can never allow it to shirk its responsibility for undermining negotiations. The discussion on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference has at least achieved this result, that is, it has nakedly exposed the United States' deliberate intention to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question to the world. If the United States continues to adhere to this policy of obstruction, it cannot escape responsibility for undermining the Geneva Conference.

    美国企图破裂关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    新华社记者　陈适五
    现在已有迹象表明，美国将不顾中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在二十二日为和平解决朝鲜问题而作的重大努力，企图破裂关于朝鲜问题的讨论。
    此间观察家特别指出此间英国人士透露出来的一则消息。这个消息说，美国和它的盟国将举行秘密会议，以决定使谈判整个破裂的问题。消息说，美国代表史密斯可能发表一项声明，宣布如果和平民主国家不准备作出任何让步的话，朝鲜问题的谈判就应该破裂。
    除此之外，在二十二日中、朝两国提出新建议以后，美国发言人立即估计会议将只再开一、两次。接着，南朝鲜的卞荣泰在二十四日记者招待会上宣布拒绝设立中立国监察委员会以监察全朝鲜选举，并且要求以联合国监督选举作为会议取得进展的条件。这些已经被普遍地认为是美国方面企图拒绝协商、破裂谈判的表示。
    此间观察家指出：周恩来外长的补充建议获得了公众舆论的良好反应，要求达成协议的情绪增长了。这就使得力图在朝鲜保持紧张局势的美国感到不安。同时，关于印度支那问题的讨论，在民主国家的努力之下，已经取得了进展，从这个星期起开始了关于军事问题的具体讨论。美国企图用破坏朝鲜问题的讨论来毒化日内瓦会议的整个气氛，影响关于印度支那问题的讨论。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论至今已整整一个月。会议的进程表明，得到中、苏两国支持的南日外务相在四月二十七日提出的建议和周恩来外长在五月二十二日提出的建议，完全可以成为达成协议的基础。在讨论南日建议的过程中，许多国家，包括美国的一些盟国在内，已经同意了或者接近了南日外务相所提出的某些原则。周恩来外长的建议更加促进了各方面意见的接近。在这些一致的或接近的意见的基础上，应该是可以达成协议的。但是，问题的症结是美国一直以极端的顽固态度，蓄意进行破坏和阻挠。人们只要分析一下南日外务相所提出的解决朝鲜问题的主要原则和各方面的意见，不难看出谁应该负阻挠达成协议的责任。
    南日外务相曾提出：和平统一朝鲜的事业必须交给朝鲜人民自己处理，不得有任何外国干涉。对于这个原则，在讨论过程中，除了无耻之极的南朝鲜代表以外，没有任何人敢公开加以反对。但是美国却坚持联合国的非法决议，硬要按照这个非法决议由联合国来干涉朝鲜的内政，由联合国来统一朝鲜。而事实上，正是由于联合国听任美国利用它的名义干涉朝鲜的内政，这才导致了南北朝鲜的分裂，并且使美国敢于发动侵略战争。而在三年战争中，打着联合国旗帜的美国并没有能够压倒朝鲜人民的抵抗，和强迫朝鲜人民接受联合国的非法决议。美国现在企图把明知朝鲜人民决不接受的东西强加于朝鲜人民，这表明它实际上并不想和平统一朝鲜，而只是故意制造会议的僵局，以便李承晚集团能够继续假借联合国的名义，在美国的支援之下实行它
  “北进统一”的冒险计划。
    南日外务相建议，为了建立朝鲜的统一政府，应该在全朝鲜居民表示自由意志的基础上，举行全朝鲜选举。这个合理的主张遭到了美国和李承晚集团的坚决反对。他们在会议开始的三个多星期中，一直坚持按照联合国的非法决议，仅仅在北朝鲜由联合国监督选出一批议员，参加到南朝鲜的国会里面去。但是这种无理主张甚至在美国的盟国中也没有得到同情。英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰等国家都主张应该在全朝鲜举行自由选举，不过它们在以下的一点上附和美国的意见，即：认为选举应该由在朝鲜的交战一方的联合国来进行监督。但是它们也表示，这种监督可以由不参加朝鲜战争的中立国家来进行。法国代表皮杜尔在五月十三日曾经说：“为了使这些选举能被认为有效，表达民意的自由条件必须由具有足够条件的中立国观察员予以审查和证明。”英国代表艾登在同一天也说：监察选举的国家“不一定必须是那些参加过朝鲜战争的国家，而可以是为这一次会议参加者所能接受的一些国家”。
    因此，周恩来外长建议由中立国监察选举，就使在监察选举的问题上各方面的意见已经十分接近。但是美国却立刻怂恿李承晚集团提出了所谓十四点的“建议”，仍然坚持必须由联合国监督选举。这个“建议”虽然在舆论压力下不得不同意举行全朝鲜选举，但是按照它所附的联合国监督选举的条件，在南朝鲜将照样搬演一番在五月二十日演出过的那一幕选举丑剧，保留李承晚的“总统”、
  “宪法”和军队，结果仍然是硬要北朝鲜在联合国监督下选出一批议员加入到南朝鲜的国会里面去。因此，美国和李承晚集团实际上并没有从它们的无理主张上后退一步。
    南日外务相建议，一切外国军队应在举行全朝鲜选举以前尽快撤退。除了美国和李承晚集团以外，几乎没有人公开反对从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的原则。美国的许多盟国，虽然它们都跳不出美国制定的界限，说什么不应过早撤兵，但也不得不表示希望从朝鲜撤退它们的军队。甚至美国后来也不能不伪装同意撤退它的军队，可是它要求的条件是在朝鲜统一以后，并且经过联合国的批准。这就表明它企图无限期地占领朝鲜，用它的军队来给李承晚集团在选举中撑腰，来支持李承晚集团“统一”全朝鲜。而且，美国还毫无道理地要求协助朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的中国人民志愿军在选举之前一个月撤退。这显然是为了使美国可以利用一切借口来协助李承晚集团对北朝鲜进行新的侵略。
    南日外务相还建议，对维护远东和平有最大关心的国家应该保证朝鲜的和平发展。没有人反对这
  一点。中华人民共和国和苏联已经表示愿意参加这种保证。英国代表艾登在他五月十三日的发言中也承认，朝鲜的“独立必须由其他国家提出适当保证加以保护”。美国对于这个问题却一直避而不谈，一直到最后才由卞荣泰出来建议由联合国予以保证。如果把这一点和卞荣泰的整个建议联系起来，就可以看出所谓联合国保证并不是为了保证朝鲜的和平发展，而只是为了保证美国在朝鲜的殖民统治。一九五零年十月七日联合国非法通过的决议，就是这样的“保证”。
    由此可见，联合国关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，已经成为美国用来堵死一切通往协议的道路的万能法宝。但是这个法宝虽然也许能够使美国达到它破坏谈判的目的，却决不能使它推卸破坏谈判的责任。日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论至少已经达到了这样一个结果，这就是使美国蓄意阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的意图赤裸裸地暴露在全世界面前。如果美国继续坚持这种阻挠政策，它决不能逃避破坏日内瓦会议的责任。
