    The Thread of Two Weeks of the Geneva Conference
    By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Du Bo
    The Geneva Conference has, in the past two weeks, held general debates on the Korean question, made some specific arrangements for the Indochina question, and formally entered into discussions today (8th) on the restoration of peace in Indochina. Although it is too early to draw conclusions on the above issues, people can clearly see the thread of the conference.
    Running through the two weeks of the conference is a fair, reasonable, and constructive thread: the proposals and attitudes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. In the discussion of the Korean question, Foreign Minister Nam Il, chief representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, proposed that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea within six months; that all-Korea elections of the National Assembly should be held on the basis of the free will of all Korean residents to achieve peaceful reunification of Korea; and that all relevant countries have the obligation to undertake guarantees not to interfere in Korean internal affairs and to ensure the peaceful development of Korea. Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal excludes foreign interference in Korea and places the solution of the Korean question on the basis of the Korean people solving their own problems, which is completely unexceptionable. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai fully supported this proposal in their speeches at the conference. Even representatives of some Western countries who attempted to circumvent and negate it could not but admit at the meeting that it was "worth serious consideration."
    All upright and insightful observers have perceived the solemnity and realistic attitude of Molotov's and Zhou Enlai's speeches in discussing the Korean question. To solve today's Asian problems and ease Asian and international tensions, it is necessary to recognize the right of Asian people to solve their own problems. The reason for the emergence of Asian tensions is mainly that the American rulers, who adhere to colonialism and imperialist expansion policies, are unwilling to face squarely the essence of the Asian people's liberation movement and the fundamentally changed Asian situation today. Although the American delegation and representatives of some other Western countries at the conference tried their best to release smoke screens around this central issue, the light of truth became even more dazzling. The consistency of the position and attitude of the peace-loving countries headed by the Soviet Union, their strong justification, and the support they receive from the people of the world lie in the fact that truth and justice are on their side.
    In the two weeks of the conference, what about the words and deeds and intentions of the American rulers? U.S. Secretary of State Dulles opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, one-sidedly demanded that North Korea, in accordance with the illegal resolutions passed by the United Nations under American manipulation in 1950, conduct "elections" under the supervision of the so-called "United Nations Korean Commission," aiming to colonize the whole of Korea like South Korea; and dared not mention at all whether the United States would guarantee not to continue interfering in Korean internal affairs.
    As some Western newspapers have said, Dulles's proposition on the Korean question is one that even Dulles himself knows cannot be accepted. Some people have also commented that Dulles came to Geneva with a big stick and lay across the conference hall. The reason why the discussion of the Korean question has not made progress so far is that the American authorities simply do not want to negotiate a solution to the problem.
    Of course, things are not that simple. While blocking a reasonable solution to the Korean question, the American authorities are also attempting to use the Geneva Conference to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, forcing other countries to take "joint action" with the United States and let go of expanding intervention in the Indochina war. Everyone knows that, according to the interpretation in the dictionary of American imperialism, "joint action" is to have others sell their lives for American capital, especially to have Asians fight Asians. This naturally first aroused the legitimate dissatisfaction of the broad masses of Asian people, who believe that Dulles's speech at the Geneva Conference was an insult and challenge to the Asian people. The communique of the Five-Power Prime Ministers' Conference in Colombo also pointed out that colonialist policies violate basic human rights and threaten world peace. Therefore, the Associated Press had to write: "The representatives of non-communist Asian countries in Geneva believe that the idea of ​​consolidating Asian security put forward by the Chinese Foreign Minister may be very attractive to the Asian people." According to the New York "Herald Tribune," quoting an important Asian figure, the Asian people are not afraid of communism but of "Western imperialism. Western imperialism has turned us into second-class citizens. This is how we understand Dulles's attempt to conclude a Southeast Asia security pact."
    Of course, opposing the expansion of the Indochina war are also the broad masses of people in various countries who helped the United States interfere in the Korean War. Since the United States is intent on not making a reasonable solution to the Korean question, for some Western countries, rashly participating in another war of intervention in Vietnam upon orders, they must guard against increasingly fierce domestic opposition and consider economic gains and losses. Therefore, when the conference discussed the Korean question, the countries participating in the "United Nations Army" appeared to be weak, their speeches were sporadic, or they "remained silent." Some representatives who "were summoned after much pleading" only repeated Dulles's clichéd speeches. The time was as short as six minutes. What is laughable is that Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson admitted at the beginning of his speech that his speech was unwilling to appear to lack support for the "United Nations" or to be misunderstood as indifferent to American accusations.
    Dulles came to Geneva with a big stick. But in the first round of the Geneva Conference, he discovered that after he shouted the order to "dress ranks," people were not looking as aligned as he thought, or were not very willing to look aligned. This, of course, was a great disappointment for the Dulles'.
    Today, when the Geneva Conference begins to discuss the Indochina issue, news from Washington says that negotiations on organizing the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc are "in progress." Due to Mr. Bidault's delaying attitude in recent days, people are naturally watching how much sincerity the French authorities have in a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. The representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has once again expressed the will of the Indochinese people. The French people's firm opposition to this dirty colonial war is obvious. The opinion here is: if Messrs. Laniel and Bidault do not get rid of the trap of the Washington authorities, or attempt to use the "power politics" of the Dulles' to play tricks, they will definitely run into a wall. May 8

### 两周日内瓦会议的脉络

    两周日内瓦会议的脉络
    本报记者　吴文焘  杜波
    两个星期的日内瓦会议对于朝鲜问题进行了一般性的辩论，对于印度支那问题作了一些具体安排，并于今日（八日）正式进入恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论。虽然有关上述问题的结论都属为时过早，但人们已经可以清楚地看出会议的脉络了。
    贯穿着两星期会议的一条公平合理而富有建设性的脉络，是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的建议和态度。在朝鲜问题的讨论中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团首席代表南日外务相提出：一切外国军队应在六个月内从朝鲜撤退；在全朝鲜居民表示自由意志的基础上举行国民议会的全朝鲜选举，以实现朝鲜的和平统一；而各有关国家有义务承担不干涉朝鲜内政保障朝鲜和平发展的保证。南日外务相的这个建议，排除了外力对朝鲜的干涉，把朝鲜问题的解决放在朝鲜人民自己解决自己问题的基础上，是完全无可非议的。苏联莫洛托夫外长和我国周恩来外长在会上的发言完全支持这个建议。就是一些企图迂回和否定它的西方国家代表也不能不在会上承认它“值得认真加以考虑”。
    一切正直的有眼光的观察家们，都体察到莫洛托夫和周恩来外长在讨论朝鲜问题的发言的严正性和实事求是的态度。要解决今天的亚洲问题，缓和亚洲和国际的紧张局势，必须承认亚洲人民解决自己问题的权利。亚洲紧张局势的所以产生，主要就是坚持殖民主义和帝国主义扩张政策的美国统治者们不愿正视亚洲人民解放运动的本质和今天已经根本改变了的亚洲形势。尽管在会议上美国代表团和一些其他西方国家的代表们极力围绕这一中心问题施放烟幕，但真理的光芒愈显得灿烂夺目。以苏联为首的爱好和平国家立场态度的所以一致，所以理直气壮，所以得到全世界人民的拥护，就在于真理和正义是在它们一方面的。
    在两周的会议中，美国统治者的言行和居心又怎样呢？美国国务卿杜勒斯反对美国军队从朝鲜撤退，片面地要求北朝鲜按照一九五零年美国操纵联合国通过的非法决议，在所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的监督下进行“选举”，旨在使全部朝鲜像南朝鲜一样殖民地化；并且根本不敢提到美国是不是保证不继续干涉朝鲜内政。
    正如一些西方报纸所说的，杜勒斯在朝鲜问题上所提出的主张，就是杜勒斯自己也知道是不能被接受的。也有人这样议论说，杜勒斯来日内瓦是带着一条大棍子横躺在会议厅里的。朝鲜问题的讨论所以至今未获进展的原因，就在于美国当局根本不想协商解决问题。
    事情当然还不仅是这样简单的。在阻挡朝鲜问题合理解决的同时，美国当局还企图利用日内瓦会议来组织一个东南亚的侵略集团，逼迫别的国家和美国采取“联合行动”，放手扩大干涉印度支那的战争。谁都知道，按照美帝国主义的字典来解释，
  “联合行动”就是要别人为美国资本去卖命，特别叫亚洲人来打亚洲人。这自然首先就引起了广大亚洲人民的正当不满，认为杜勒斯在日内瓦会议上的发言是对亚洲人民的侮辱和挑战。在科伦坡举行的五国总理会议的公报中，也指斥了殖民主义政策违反基本人权和威胁世界和平。因而美联社也不得不写道：“亚洲非共产主义国家在日内瓦的代表认为中国外交部长提出的巩固亚洲安全的思想，可能对亚洲人民有很大的吸引力。”据纽约“先驱论坛报”引述一个亚洲重要人物的话说：亚洲人民害怕的不是共产主义而是“西方帝国主义。西方帝国主义把我们变成次等民族。对于杜勒斯力图缔结东南亚安全公约，我们就是这样了解的。”
    当然，反对扩大印度支那战争的还有帮助美国干涉朝鲜战争的各国里的广大人民。既然美国存心不想使朝鲜问题合理解决，对于西方某些国家来说，贸然奉命再参加一次干涉越南的战争，又要提防日益激烈反对的国内舆论和考虑经济上的得失。因之，在大会讨论朝鲜问题时，参加“联合国军”的国家就表现得理屈词穷，发言零落，或“保持沉默”。有些“千呼万唤始出来”的代表也只是重复一下杜勒斯的滥调发言。时间有的少到六分钟。引人发笑的是，加拿大外长皮尔逊在发言中劈头就招认他的发言是不愿显得对“联合国”缺乏支持，或者被误认为对美国的指责漠不关心。
    杜勒斯带着一条大棍子来到日内瓦。可是在日内瓦会议的第一个回合中，就发现他喊过“看齐”的口令后人们还没有看得那样齐，或者不大愿意看得很齐。这对于杜勒斯们来说，当然是大煞风景的事。
    今天当日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题的时候，华盛顿传来的消息说，关于组织东南亚侵略集团的谈判“正在进行中”。由于皮杜尔先生近日来所表现的拖延态度，人们自然也就注视着法国当局对和平解决印度支那问题的诚意到底有几分了。越南民主共和国的代表已经再一次表达了印度支那人民的意志。法国人民坚决反对这一肮脏的殖民战争是显而易见的。这里的舆论是：如果拉尼埃和皮杜尔先生们不摆脱华盛顿当局的圈套，或者企图借杜勒斯们的“实力政策”来耍花枪，那是一定要碰壁的。               五月八日
