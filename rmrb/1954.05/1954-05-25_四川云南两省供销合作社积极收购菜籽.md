　　Sichuan and Yunnan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Actively Purchase Rapeseed
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are actively purchasing rapeseed. As of early May, Yunnan had purchased more than 7.5 million jin; the Suining and Nanchong regions of Sichuan had collected more than 11 million jin; and more than 22.24 million jin had been collected in over ten counties in the Wenjiang region in the first ten days of May. Before the rapeseed matured, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions held meetings to explain the purchase policies and arrange work to cadres at all levels. They also carried out publicity on the state's pre-purchase of agricultural products to farmers through the board of directors, supervisors, and members' representative meetings, and signed pre-purchase contracts for rapeseed with many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers. The Ziyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan signed more than 700 contracts with farmers, pre-purchasing more than 200,000 jin of rapeseed; by the beginning of May, Xindu County had signed contracts with five agricultural production cooperatives and 815 mutual aid teams to pre-purchase more than 4.9 million jin of rapeseed. The Daxian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of having processors (private oil presses) responsible for quality inspection and storage, and the supply and marketing cooperative responsible for weighing, payment, and supervision, which not only facilitated the farmers but also solved the difficulty of insufficient cadres in the supply and marketing cooperative. While purchasing rapeseed, various regions are also actively processing oil cakes to supply farmers. The Wenjiang region of Sichuan has organized more than 3,000 sets of public-private oil mills and presses, which can supply farmers with more than 37.7 million jin of oil cakes by the end of June, so that 2.2 million mu of rice paddies can be fertilized with an average of 17 jin per mu. Private oil households in Yuxi County, Yunnan, can also press more than 15,000 jin of rapeseed every day.

　　四川云南两省供销合作社积极收购菜籽
    四川、云南两省各地供销合作社积极收购菜籽。至五月初止，云南已收购七百五十多万斤；四川遂宁、南充两专区收进一千一百多万斤；温江专区十余县五月上旬收进二千二百二十四万斤。当菜籽未成熟以前，各地供销社大都召开会议，向各级干部交代收购政策、布置工作。并通过理、监事会、社员代表会向农民进行国家预购农产品的宣传，与不少农业生产合作社、互助组以及部分个体农民签订了预购菜籽合同。四川资阳县供销社和农民订立七百多件合同，预购菜籽二十多万斤；新都县至五月初，和五个农业生产合作社、八百一十五个互助组订了预购菜籽四百九十多万斤的合同。达县供销社采用由加工户（私营榨油厂）负责验级、保管，供销社负责过秤、付款和监督，既便利了农民，又解决了供销社干部不足的困难。与收购菜籽的同时，各地并积极加工油饼供应农民。四川温江专区已组织公私油碾、油榨三千多副，至六月底即可供应农民三千七百多万斤油饼，使二百二十万亩稻田，每亩平均能施十七斤追肥。云南玉溪县私营油户，每天也可榨菜籽一万五千多斤。
