Xinhua News Agency, 28th. This spring ploughing and sowing season, supply and marketing cooperatives have carried out pre-purchase work in the main grain and agricultural product areas like cotton, giving farmers great support in increasing grain and cash crops. The pre-purchase work of coarse grains and soybeans in the Northeast, tea in East China, wheat in Anhui Province, cotton and peanuts in Henan Province, and spring wool in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been basically completed. Pre-purchase work in the early rice areas of Jiangnan and the early autumn crop areas of Jiangbei is underway. This year, the area for pre-purchasing cotton is larger and the quantity is greater. Supply and marketing cooperatives in major cotton-producing areas are signing pre-purchase contracts with farmers. As of May 20th, Hebei Province had pre-purchased more than 370 million jin of seed cotton, and the cotton pre-purchase work in Shandong Province is expected to be completed by mid-June.

Farmers in various places have received a large amount of advance deposits from the state for pre-selling agricultural products. This deposit has played a huge supporting role in farmers' production during the slack season. The advance deposit paid for pre-purchasing coarse grains and soybeans in the Northeast reached 200 billion yuan. At the same time as determining the pre-purchase plan for agricultural products this year, North China planned to pay an advance deposit of 500 billion yuan. The advance deposit pre-paid for wheat and rapeseed in Anhui Province reached 200 billion yuan. According to statistics from six townships in Anqing Prefecture, farmers used the deposit to purchase more than 71,000 jin of fertilizer and more than 12,500 large and small farm tools. The Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to use 15 billion yuan of pre-purchase deposits in tea-producing areas to help farmers improve the quality of spring tea. Most of this deposit has now been distributed to farmers. In Laiyang, Wendeng, Linyi and other prefectures in Shandong Province, pre-purchasing peanut kernels and peanuts, had paid more than 13.3 billion yuan in deposits to farmers as of May 13th. In the pre-purchase work, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places in Zhejiang Province generally started with production and helped farmers formulate production plans. In many areas of Henan Province, farmers were also helped to formulate plans for using deposits. According to incomplete statistics from Tangyin, Qi County, and Ye County in Henan Province, 99 agricultural producers' cooperatives and 532 year-round mutual aid groups have signed pre-purchase contracts with local supply and marketing cooperatives, receiving deposits of more than 300 million yuan.

After farmers and supply and marketing cooperatives signed pre-purchase contracts, they arranged production in accordance with the contracts. With the cooperation of other work, the cotton sowing plan in North China and East China has been overfulfilled. After receiving pre-purchase deposits, 101 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Anyang Prefecture, Henan Province, changed 90% of their cotton fields to sow Si Zi and Dai Zi cotton seeds. The day after the farmers of Shuanglan Village in Ji County signed a pre-purchase contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, all the men and women laborers in the village were mobilized, and they planted 30 mu of drought-resistant cotton in one day. Under the promotion of pre-purchase work and other work in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, farmers have increased peanut planting by 500,000 mu.

    国家在今年春耕季节中大量预购农产品
    推动农民积极安排粮棉增产计划
   【新华社二十八日讯】今年春耕播种季节，供销合作社在粮、棉等几种主要农产品的产区进行了预购工作，给农民增产粮食和经济作物以巨大支援。东北区的粗粮、大豆，华东区的茶叶，安徽省的小麦，河南省的棉花和花生，以及内蒙古自治区的春毛等产品的预购工作，已经基本结束。江南早稻和江北早秋作物产区的预购工作正在进行。今年预购棉花的地区较大、数量较多，各主要产棉区的供销合作社正在和农民签订预购合同。到五月二十日止，河北省已预购籽棉三亿七千多万斤，山东省预购棉花工作到六月中旬可全部结束。
    各地农民在预售农产品中，得到了国家预付的大批订金。这笔订金在青黄不接季节对农民生产起了巨大支援作用。东北区预购粗粮、大豆付出的现款订金达两千亿元。华北区在今年确定预购农产品计划的同时，就计划付出订金五千亿元。安徽省预购小麦、菜籽预付的订金达两千亿元，据安庆专区六个乡统计，农民用订金购买肥料七万一千多斤，大小农具一万二千五百多件。安徽省供销合作社计划在产茶区用一百五十亿元的预购订金帮助农民改进春茶质量，现在这笔订金大部已发到农民手里。山东省莱阳、文登、临沂等专区预购花生仁和花生果，到五月十三日止，已付给农民订金一百三十三亿多元。浙江省各地供销合作社在预购中，一般从生产入手，帮助农民订出了生产计划。河南省很多地区还帮助农民订了使用订金的计划。据河南省汤阴、淇县、邺县不完全统计，有九十九个农业生产合作社和五百三十二个常年互助组和当地供销合作社订立预购合同，得到的订金有三亿多元。
    农民和供销合作社签订预购合同后，都按照合同安排生产，加上其他工作的配合，华北、华东地区的棉花播种计划已超额完成。河南省安阳专区有一百零一个农业生产合作社得到预购订金后，把百分之九十的棉田改种了斯字棉和岱字棉种。汲县双兰村农民和供销合作社订了预购合同的第二天，全村男女劳动力都出动，一天抗旱点种棉花三十亩。山东省莱阳专区在预购工作和其他工作的推动下，农民已增种花生五十万亩。
