Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Geneva Conference began discussing the Indochina issue at 4:30 PM on the 8th. The general debate on the Korean issue did not take place on the 8th.

The participants in the meeting on the 8th included Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China; Molotov, Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union; Georges Bidault, Foreign Minister of France; Anthony Eden, British Foreign Secretary; Walter Bedell Smith, US Undersecretary of State; Phạm Văn Đồng, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; and representatives of the three member states of the French Union in Indochina – Nguyễn Trung Vinh, representing the State of Vietnam; Phoung Sananikone, representing the Kingdom of Laos; and Tep Phan, representing the Kingdom of Cambodia.

According to the pre-conference agreement, the discussions on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference were to be chaired alternately by British representative Anthony Eden and Soviet representative Molotov. Eden chaired the meeting on the 8th.

After delivering brief opening remarks, Eden announced matters relating to the conference procedure. It has been decided that only those participating in the conference can attend the meetings. The official languages of the conference are French, Russian, English, and Chinese, which will be used in turn each day.

The conference then proceeded to a general debate. French representative Bidault spoke first.

Bidault, in an attempt to divert world and French public opinion from the urgent concern for restoring peace in Indochina, began by greatly exaggerating the importance of the recently concluded Battle of Dien Bien Phu. He particularly emphasized the evacuation of the wounded and sick from Dien Bien Phu, attempting to create the impression that it was not the French side, but the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, that violated humanitarian principles in the war. However, everyone knows that it was the French army that used all sorts of inhumane means against the Vietnamese people and the captured personnel of the Vietnamese People's Army during the war, while the Vietnamese People's Army had consistently adopted a policy of leniency towards prisoners of war and had repeatedly released French prisoners. Bidault stubbornly claimed that the Vietnamese People's Army refused to accept France's proposal to evacuate the wounded and sick. However, he dared not mention the fact that the French side had never engaged in direct negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this issue.

In his speech, Bidault expressed the hope that the discussions would lead to a "solution acceptable to all." He said that he would not give up any opportunity to achieve a fair and reasonable peace and guarantee that the war would not recur. Bidault also called on the conference to avoid getting bogged down in "discussions of ideological concepts," because this would "hinder the possible results of the conference" and "rigidify the positions of both sides." However, Bidault did not actually do as he said. He used many words to slander the national liberation movements of the Asian peoples and the social systems they had chosen according to their own will.

Bidault attempted to distort the history of Indochina. He portrayed the tragic lives of the Indochinese people before the Pacific War as if they were in paradise. It is worth noting that Bidault, in narrating the history of Indochina, completely avoided mentioning the fact that the French colonial authorities and Bảo Đại surrendered to Japan during World War II, and that the Vietnamese people persisted in resisting the war.

Bidault attempted to shift the responsibility for starting the war onto the Vietnamese people. However, everyone knows that in order to strive for peace, the Vietnamese people made patient and repeated efforts in the negotiations between Vietnam and France in 1946. It was because of these efforts of the Vietnamese people that the Preliminary Agreement and the Provisional Agreement were signed. However, the French authorities repeatedly violated the agreements, repeatedly created provocative incidents, and completely tore up these agreements in December 1946, launching a large-scale war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. From that time until March 1947, President Ho Chi Minh appealed to the French government and the French people for peace eight times, but the French government never responded.

Bidault futilely attempted to obliterate the legitimacy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which was established by the Vietnamese people according to their own will. In fact, as early as 1946, the French government recognized in the Preliminary Agreement that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "is a free state, with its government, parliament, army, and finances."

Bidault attributed the French army's successive defeats in Indochina under the unanimous opposition of the Indochinese people to the so-called "assistance" from "Communist countries" to the Indochinese people. It is not difficult to see that the purpose of Bidault's fabrication of this lie is precisely to cover up the increasingly blatant US intervention in the Indochina war.

Bidault intentionally avoided mentioning the Indochinese people's right to national independence. He only suggested that the conference adopt a principle, namely, the general cessation of hostilities in Indochina under the necessary security guarantees. He completely ignored the just struggle of the Cambodian and Lao people for national liberation, describing the efforts of the two peoples to fight for freedom and independence as foreign "aggression," while describing the French colonial war in Vietnam as a "civil war." Starting from such a factually incorrect premise, he believed that there was no question of stopping hostilities in Cambodia and Laos, and limited the cessation of hostilities to Vietnam.

Bidault then put forward France's proposals for stopping hostilities in Indochina. Everyone remembers that the ceasefire conditions proposed by French Prime Minister Laniel on March 5 this year were referred to by French public opinion as demanding the surrender of the Vietnamese people. Bidault's proposal this time shows that the French ruling authorities still regard themselves as colonial rulers and appear as victors. How can hostilities be truly stopped and peace restored in Indochina? Bidault's proposal argues that in Vietnam, regular troops should be assembled in concentration areas determined by the Geneva Conference, as suggested by the joint commands of both sides; in Cambodia and Laos, Bidault demanded the withdrawal of the so-called regular and irregular troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that do not exist in the area. He made no mention of the withdrawal of French troops. Bidault advocated that in the three regions of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, armed forces that do not belong to regular troops or peacekeeping forces should be disarmed; prisoners of war and detained civilians should be released immediately; and the above conditions should be implemented under the supervision of the International Committee. Bidault's proposal advocates a ceasefire in Indochina after agreement is reached on the above items. He also argued that the implementation of this agreement should be guaranteed by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference. Any violation will immediately trigger consultations between the aforementioned countries in order to take appropriate measures individually or collectively.

Phạm Văn Đồng, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, spoke after a fifteen-minute recess, suggesting that representatives of the Khmer Resistance Government and the Lao Resistance Government be invited to participate in this conference (full text to be issued separately).

US Undersecretary of State Smith then spoke. He opposed discussing the issue of conference membership. According to him, the countries participating in the Geneva Conference seemed to have been decided at the Berlin Conference. But everyone knows that the Berlin Conference only stipulated five countries for the discussion of the Indochina issue, namely the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and China, but did not stipulate which other relevant countries should participate in the conference. Smith suggested that the conference be adjourned and that the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States should re-negotiate the issue of membership.

Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, then spoke. Zhou Enlai said, "I disagree with the opinion of the US representative. I think this conference has the right to discuss the issue of the members of this conference. The delegation of the People's Republic of China fully supports Mr. Phạm Văn Đồng's suggestion. We believe that his suggestion is fair and reasonable. I propose that our conference adopt the suggestion of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then spoke. Molotov said: "We know that this conference is to consider the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. As can be seen from the agenda, the conference is to discuss the issues of the three countries of Indochina. It is clear that for the success of the conference, all relevant parties should be invited to participate in this conference."

Molotov added: "Not only does Vietnam have a war of liberation, but the people of Cambodia and Laos are also fighting for their independence and freedom. The people of the two countries have established two democratic governments, which are supported by the people and possess considerable areas. Therefore, we cannot deny their right to participate. In view of the above, the Soviet delegation supports the suggestion of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

Molotov then cited the communique of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference to refute the statement of the US representative. He said: "It can be clearly seen from this communique that in addition to the five countries of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, other relevant countries should also be invited to participate in the conference. The Soviet delegation believes that the first task of the above five countries is to decide which countries to invite. It has already been discussed in Geneva that the Western three countries should invite the member states of the Indochina Federation, and the Soviet Union and China should invite the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The invitation to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was issued by the Soviet Union and China. Similarly, I know that the five countries also agreed that the three member states of the Indochina Federation could also participate. Therefore, the delegations of these three countries are now in the conference room, but the Berlin Conference communique did not originally stipulate that they could attend this conference."

Molotov then said: "Therefore, it is clear that in this conference room, a delegation has every right to request other countries to participate in the conference. The US delegation believes that the suggestion of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should be discussed outside the conference room. The Soviet delegation does not object to this, but believes that it should be discussed by the five countries in accordance with the communique of the Berlin Conference. Discussions by four countries will not be effective."

Bidault then spoke. He said that the Khmer Resistance Government and the Lao Resistance Government are "non-existent" and "phantom-like governments," and disagreed with the participation of representatives of the two resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos for this absurd "reason." He said that he did not object to the adjournment. He believes that no matter how important this issue is, discussing it is a "waste of time."

Eden then spoke. He believed that the issue of inviting countries to participate in the conference should be discussed by the four countries participating in the Berlin Conference. He disagreed with Phạm Văn Đồng's suggestion. He agreed to the adjournment.

Tep Phan, representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, then spoke. He pretended not to know that there was a national liberation movement and a Khmer Resistance Government in Cambodia, but he inadvertently admitted that his government could not control the areas liberated by the Khmer Resistance Government. Tep Phan boasted that his government had obtained "independence" from France. But everyone knows that the King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, admitted on May 11, 1953, that Cambodia was still "a long way" from "political independence." Cambodia's military and diplomacy are still in the hands of France, but Tep Phan tried to cover up by saying that they went to Paris not to beg for "independence," but to "adjust relations." He wantonly slandered the Khmer Resistance Government and the Cambodian people who opposed French colonial rule, and opposed inviting representatives of the Khmer Resistance Government and the Lao Resistance Government to participate in the conference.

Zhou Enlai then spoke, expressing support for the Soviet delegation's opinion, namely: that the five countries of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and China should discuss the suggestion of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam outside the conference. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the opinions of the French representative and the Cambodian representative completely ignored the national independence and rights of the Lao and Cambodian peoples.

Phạm Văn Đồng spoke again. He said: "The issue of sending representatives of the Khmer and Lao Resistance Governments to participate in this conference is not a procedural issue, but a factual issue. The people of Cambodia and Laos are fighting in resistance. Why is there this war? This is because the imperialist countries have invaded our land. The people are forced to resist. As a result, armed forces and resistance governments were organized. For this reason, we believe that relevant countries should be invited to participate in this conference."

Phạm Văn Đồng said: "Whether the Khmer and Lao Resistance Governments are phantom governments or real governments, it is best to invite their representatives to come and see whether they are people or phantoms. In the United Nations conference, the French representative said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a 'phantom government.' The Soviet representative said, since it is a 'phantom,' why did you send troops to fight it? These 'phantoms' have been fighting you for many years, and have destroyed many of your troops. These 'phantoms' are now sitting in front of you." Phạm Văn Đồng said, "I fully support the Soviet delegation's suggestion that the five countries discuss it outside the conference."

After Phạm Văn Đồng's speech, the chairman said: "There are now two different suggestions at the meeting. One advocates that the four countries negotiate the suggestion of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam outside the meeting, and the other advocates that the five countries negotiate outside the meeting. These two suggestions are irreconcilable." He suggested an adjournment.

The representative of the Kingdom of Laos then spoke. Like the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, he spoke in French. He recklessly tried to deny the existence of the Lao Resistance Government, ignoring the facts, and opposed Phạm Văn Đồng's suggestion on this basis. After his speech, the chairman announced that the meeting would be adjourned until 3:00 PM on May 10 to continue.

    日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题
    范文同建议邀请高棉寮国抗战政府的代表
    周恩来和莫洛托夫一致支持范文同的建议
    据新华社讯：日内瓦会议于八日下午四时半开始讨论印度支那问题。关于朝鲜问题的一般辩论八日没有进行。
    八日参加会议的有中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来、苏联外交部长莫洛托夫、法国外交部长皮杜尔、英国外交大臣艾登、美国副国务卿史密斯、越南民主共和国副总理兼代理外交部长范文同、法兰西联邦印度支那三成员国的代表——越南国代表阮忠荣、寮国王国代表冯·萨纳尼空、高棉王国代表泰普潘。
    根据会前取得的协议，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论由英国代表艾登和苏联代表莫洛托夫轮流担任主席。八日的会议由艾登担任主席。
    艾登在致简短的开幕辞以后，宣布了有关会议程序的事项。现已决定，只有参加会议的人才能出席会议。会议的正式语文是法文、俄文、英文和中文，逐日依次替换。
    会议随即进入一般辩论。法国代表皮杜尔首先发言。
    皮杜尔为了转移世界舆论和法国舆论对于恢复印度支那和平的迫切关心，一开头就大事渲染刚刚结束的奠边府战事的重要性。他特别强调从奠边府撤退伤病员一节，企图在人们的心目中造成一种印象，似乎在战争中违反人道原则的不是法国方面，而是越南民主共和国方面。然而，谁都知道，正是法国军队在战争中对于越南人民和越南人民军的被俘人员使用了种种不人道的手段，而越南人民军方面则一向采取宽待战俘的政策并曾多次释放法方战俘。皮杜尔硬说，越南人民军拒绝接受法国所提撤退伤病员的建议，然而，他却不敢说出法国方面一直没有和越南民主共和国就这一问题进行直接谈判的事实。
    皮杜尔在发言中表示希望这次讨论能得出“大家都能接受的解决办法”。他说，他不放弃任何机会来取得公平、合理的和平，并保证战争不再复发。皮杜尔还呼吁会议应避免陷入“思想观念的讨论”，因为这样就会“阻止会议可能获得的效果”，
  “使双方的立场僵化”。然而，皮杜尔在实际上并没有照他自己所说的那样做，他用了不少的话来诬蔑亚洲人民的民族解放运动和他们根据自己的意志所选择的社会制度。
    皮杜尔企图歪曲印度支那的历史。他把太平洋战争以前印度支那人民的悲惨生活描绘得好像天堂一样。值得注意的是，皮杜尔在叙述印度支那的历史时完全不敢提到在二次大战期间法国殖民当局和保大向日本屈膝投降，越南人民坚持抗战的事实。
    皮杜尔企图把法国发动战争的责任转嫁到越南人民的身上。然而，大家知道，为了争取和平，越南人民曾经在一九四六年越法双方的谈判中作了耐心的、多次的努力。正是由于越南人民的这种努力，双方才签订了初步协定和临时协定。但是，法国当局却一再破坏协定，多次制造挑衅事件，并在一九四六年十二月完全撕毁了这些协定，向越南人民发动了大规模的侵略战争。从此时起，到一九四七年三月止，胡志明主席曾经八次向法国政府和法国人民呼吁和平，法国政府始终不予答复。
    皮杜尔徒劳地企图抹煞越南人民根据自己意志建立起来的越南民主共和国政府的合法性。然而，事实上，早在一九四六年，法国政府就在初步协定中承认了越南民主共和国“是一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政”。
    皮杜尔把法国军队在印度支那人民一致反对下节节失败的事实归咎于所谓“共产党国家”对印度支那人民的“援助”。不难看出，皮杜尔制造这种谎言的目的，正是为了掩饰美国对印度支那战争日益露骨的干涉。
    皮杜尔有意避开印度支那人民的民族独立的权利完全不提，他只建议本会议通过一项原则，即在必需的安全保证之下，在印度支那普遍停止敌对行动。他完全漠视高棉和寮国人民争取民族解放的正义斗争，把两国人民争取自由独立的努力说成是外国的“侵犯”，同时把法国在越南进行的殖民战争说成是“内战”。从这样的违背事实的前提出发，他认为在高棉和寮国不存在停止敌对行动的问题，而把停止敌对行动只限于越南。
    皮杜尔接着就提出了法国关于停止印度支那敌对行动的建议。大家记得，今年三月五日法国总理拉尼埃所提出的停战条件，曾被法国舆论称之为要越南人民投降。而这次皮杜尔的建议，表明法国统治当局仍以殖民统治者自居，以战胜者姿态出现，这样，如何能在印度支那真正停止敌对行动和恢复和平？皮杜尔的建议主张：在越南方面，应按双方总指挥部的建议将正规军集合在日内瓦会议所决定的集中地区；在高棉和寮国方面，皮杜尔要求撤退并不存在的所谓在该地区的越南民主共和国的正规军与非正规军，他完全没有提到撤退法国军队。皮杜尔主张，在越南、高棉和寮国三个地区，凡不属于正规军或维持治安的部队的武装力量应予解除武装；立即释放战俘与被拘平民；以上条件应在国际委员会监督下执行。皮杜尔的建议主张在就以上各项取得协议后在印度支那实现停战。他还主张：这种协定的执行，应由参加日内瓦会议的各国予以保证。任何违犯行为将立刻引起上述国家间的谘商，以便个别地或集体地采取适当措施。
    越南民主共和国副总理兼代理外交部长范文同在会议休息十五分钟后发言，建议邀请高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府的代表参加这次会议（全文另发）。
    美国副国务卿史密斯接着发言。他反对讨论会议的成员问题。据他说，参加日内瓦会议的国家好像是在柏林会议上已经决定了。但是大家知道，柏林会议对于讨论印度支那问题只规定了五个国家，即苏、英、法、美、中，却并没有规定参加会议的其他有关国家是那些国家。史密斯建议会议休会，由苏、英、法、美四国就成员问题再行协商。
    中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来接着发言。周恩来说，我不同意美国代表的意见。我认为这个会议有权利讨论这个会议的成员问题。中华人民共和国代表团完全支持范文同先生的建议。我们认为他的建议是公平的、合理的。我提议，我们的会议应通过越南民主共和国代表团的建议。
    苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫接着发言。莫洛托夫说：我们知道，这次会议是要考虑恢复印度支那和平问题。从议程可以看出，会议是要讨论印度支那三个国家的问题。很明显，为了会议的成功，应该邀请有关各方都参加这个会议。
    莫洛托夫又说：不仅越南有解放战争，而且高棉、寮国人民也为他们的独立、自由而进行着斗争。两国人民成立了两个民主政府，它们得到人民的支持，并拥有相当的区域。因此我们不能拒绝他们参加的权利。鉴于以上所说，苏联代表团支持越南民主共和国代表团的建议。
    莫洛托夫接着援引了柏林四国外长会议的公报来反驳美国代表的发言。他说：从这个公报中可以明显看出，除了中、苏、美、英、法五国以外，还要邀请其他有关国家参加会议。苏联代表团认为上述五国的头一件工作就是由他们来决定邀请哪些国家。在日内瓦已经商讨过，由西方三国邀请印度支那联邦成员国，由苏、中两国邀请越南民主共和国。对越南民主共和国的请柬是由苏、中两国发出的。同样的，我知道五国也同意了三个印度支那联邦成员国也可参加。因此，这三个国家的代表团现在已在会议室中，而柏林会议的公报原来并没有规定他们是可以出席这次会议的。
    莫洛托夫接着说：因此，很明显，在这个会议室中，一个代表团是完全有权利要求其他国家参加会议的。美国代表团认为越南民主共和国代表团的建议，应在会议室以外去讨论。对于这一点，苏联代表团并不反对，但认为应该按照柏林会议的公报，由五国加以讨论。四国讨论是不会有成效的。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他说高棉抗战政府、寮国抗战政府是“并不存在的”，是“幽灵似的政府”，并以这种荒唐的“理由”，不同意高棉和寮国两国抗战政府的代表参加。他说他不反对休会。他认为不论这个问题的重要如何，讨论它都是“浪费时间”。
    艾登接着发言。他认为邀请参加会议的国家的问题应由参加柏林会议的四国讨论，他不同意范文同的建议。他赞成休会。
    高棉王国代表泰普潘接着发言。他装作不知道在高棉有民族解放运动和高棉抗战政府，但他无意中又承认他的政府无法控制那些为高棉抗战政府解放了的地区。泰普潘吹嘘他的政府已经从法国手中得到了“独立”。可是大家都知道，高棉王国的国王西哈努克在一九五三年五月十一日曾经承认，高棉离“政治独立”还有“很长一段路”。高棉的军事和外交都还操在法国手里，可是泰普潘却企图掩饰说，他们之所以到巴黎去，并不是为了乞求“独立”，而是为了“调整关系”。他对高棉抗战政府和反对法国殖民统治的高棉人民肆意进行诬蔑，并反对邀请高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府的代表参加会议。
    周恩来接着发言，表示支持苏联代表团的意见，即：由苏、英、美、法、中五国在会外讨论越南民主共和国的建议。周恩来指出：法国代表和高棉王国代表的意见是完全漠视寮国和高棉人民的民族独立和权利。
    范文同再次发言。他说：高棉和寮国抗战政府派代表参加这次会议的问题，不是一个程序问题，而是一个事实问题。高棉和寮国人民正在进行抗战中。为什么会有这个战争呢？这是因为帝国主义国家侵犯我们的土地。人民被迫抗战。结果就组织了武装部队和抗战政府。为了这个原因，我们认为应该邀请有关国家参加这个会议。
    范文同说：高棉和寮国抗战政府是幽灵政府还是真正的政府，最好把它们的代表请来，你们看看到底是人还是幽灵。在联合国的会议中，法国代表曾说越南民主共和国政府是“幽灵政府”。苏联代表说，既然是“幽灵”，你们为什么要派军队和它打仗呢？这些“幽灵”已经跟你们打了好多年，并且已经消灭了你们许多的军队，这些“幽灵”现在已经坐到你们面前来了。范文同说，我完全支持苏联代表团的建议，由五国在会外加以讨论。
    在范文同发言以后，主席说：现在在会上已经有了两个不同的建议。一个主张由四国在会外去协商越南民主共和国的建议，一个主张由五国在会外去协商。这两个建议是不相调和的。他建议休会。
    寮国王国的代表接着发言。和高棉王国的代表一样，他讲的也是法文。他完全不顾事实地妄想否认寮国抗战政府的存在，并以此反对范文同的建议。在他发言以后，主席即宣布会议休会到五月十日下午三时继续举行。
