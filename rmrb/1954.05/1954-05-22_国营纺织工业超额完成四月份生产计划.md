The state-owned and jointly state-private enterprises under the Central Textile Industry Department overfulfilled the April production plan for total output value and major products. The total output value plan was fulfilled by 102.74 percent. The completion rate of several major products is as follows: cotton yarn 102.30 percent; cotton cloth 101.40 percent; printed and dyed cloth 104.26 percent; wool fabrics 103.90 percent; and burlap sacks 101.49 percent.

At the beginning of the second quarter, leading comrades from the Textile Industry Department led several work groups to Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places to inspect the work following the National State-Owned Textile Factory Directors' Conference, and to check the work of various factories in strengthening planning management and implementing operation plans in the second quarter. The work groups focused on on-site understanding and summarized and improved the good experiences of some factories for promotion. For example, the Northwest Work Group will focus on summarizing the experience of the State-Owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory in rapidly transitioning from the basic construction stage to regular production, with the fine yarn workshop becoming a national model workshop.

In April, factories throughout the textile industry system began work to reduce workshop temperatures in the summer. The Textile Industry Department and the Textile Workers' Union jointly issued instructions requiring all units to establish and improve labor protection work organizations to reduce workshop temperatures in the summer, especially in factories where high temperatures still exist. All new and existing equipment renovations at state-owned cotton mills in Shanghai can be completed before the end of May. It is estimated that the workshop temperature this summer can be reduced by half a degree Celsius compared to last year. The Central and Southern region added eleven large-scale air supply fans, thirteen small-scale fans, and thirty-nine exhaust fans this year. Other printing and dyeing and silk reeling factories are also adding ventilation and cooling equipment.

Under the requirement to reduce costs, the cotton mills under the East China Textile Administration Bureau made efforts to save cotton in April and achieved certain results. The East China Textile Administration Bureau is preparing to focus on helping factories with lower cotton consumption to summarize experience, formulate appropriate measures, and prepare to convene engineers from various factories to conduct research and promote them.

    国营纺织工业超额完成四月份生产计划
    【本报讯】中央纺织工业部所属国营及中央合营企业超额完成四月份总产值和主要产品的生产计划。总产值计划完成百分之一零二点七四；几种主要产品的完成数计：棉纱百分之一零二点三○；棉布百分之一零一点四○；印染布百分之一零四点二六；毛织品百分之一零三点九○；麻袋百分之一零一点四九。
    第二季度开始时，纺织工业部领导同志率领了几个工作组，分赴上海、天津、青岛等地，检查全国国营纺织厂厂长会议以后的工作，并检查各厂在第二季度加强计划管理推行作业计划的工作。工作组有重点地进行现场了解，对于某些厂的良好经验予以总结提高，以便推广。例如对国营西北第一棉纺织厂由基本建设阶段迅速地转入正规生产，细纱车间成为全国模范车间的经验，西北工作组将着重进行总结。
    四月份，纺织工业系统各工厂着手进行夏季降低车间温度的工作。纺织工业部和纺织工会联合发出指示，要求各单位建立和健全劳动保护的工作机构，降低夏季车间温度，特别是高温现象仍然存在的工厂，更应特别注意。上海各国营棉纺织厂在五月底以前，所有新添及原有设备的装修全部可以竣工，估计今年夏季的车间温度，可比去年普遍降低摄氏半度。中南全区今年添置大型送风机十一套、小型的十三套，排气风扇三十九台。其他印染、缫丝厂都在添置通风降温设备。
    在降低成本的工作要求之下，华东纺织管理局所属各棉纺织厂，在四月份努力节约用棉并做出了一定的成绩，华东纺织管理局准备重点帮助用棉量较少的工厂总结经验，制订出适当的措施，并准备召集各厂工程师进行研究后加以推广。
