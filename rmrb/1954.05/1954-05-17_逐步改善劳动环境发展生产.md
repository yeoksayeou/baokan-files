    A Beautiful "May 1st" Garden
    The state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory's "May 1st" Garden has been officially opened. This garden was created by utilizing vacant land. It has a quiet river, pavilions, rockeries, and stone benches along the riverbank, as well as lush willows and various other trees.
    This garden was built according to the provisions of the collective contract for the first quarter of 1954 at the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory. The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory is far from downtown Shanghai, and there is a lack of cultural and recreational activities in the vicinity of the factory. Therefore, the factory built this garden on the basis of production development. After a period of intense labor, workers can come here to rest and have fun.
    Three New-Type Sunlamp Bathhouses
    The three new-type sunlamp bathhouses built by the Hegang Mining Bureau in the Dongshan, Xingshan, and Nanshan mines were officially opened on April 23rd. These sunlamp bathhouses were designed and built according to the standards of the sunlamp bathhouses in the Soviet Donbas coal mines. They include changing rooms, drying rooms, mechanical laundry rooms, bathrooms, sunlamp rooms, health rooms, medical rooms, etc. The bathrooms have showers and tubs. After work, workers can wear colored glasses and use sunlamps for a short time to promote metabolism and restore physical strength. At the opening ceremony, the workers expressed their gratitude to the Communist Party for its concern and expressed their determination to step up production to complete the state plan.
    Opening Nutrition Canteens
    The labor union of the Chongqing Public Bus Company opened a nutrition canteen in Xiaolongkan in March of last year for its employees. Workers who are physically weak can enjoy nutritional benefits. During the nutritional period, each person receives 150,000 yuan worth of food per month, and they only pay 70,000 yuan themselves. The other 80,000 yuan is paid from the labor insurance fund of the labor union, and the administration provides half a pound of milk per day. All employees who have received nutrition have improved their physical health, and some have become stronger from being weak. For example, Comrade Dai Ping, an office worker in the company's labor and wage department, gained 10.47 pounds after seven months of nutrition, and looked radiant and full of energy. In the past year or so, 268 employees have improved their health in the nutrition canteen.
    Quanzhou City's Workers' Club
    The Quanzhou City Workers' Club in Fujian has increasingly become an indispensable place in the cultural life of Quanzhou workers. Whenever you walk in here on weekend evenings, you can see crowds of happy people everywhere. It has more than 8,000 books, more than 2,200 comic books, 60 kinds of newspapers and magazines, more than 20 kinds of musical instruments such as harmoniums, violins, and huqins, four table tennis tables, and many recreational equipment such as military chess, red flag racing chess, and playing cards. Since its establishment on New Year's Day this year, the average daily number of employees who come here to participate in activities has exceeded 1,000.
    The club has performed the most popular Minnan operas "Chen San Wu Niang" and "Drum Dance," as well as short plays written and performed by workers such as "A Load of Rice" and "After the Rain." Before "May 1st," a table tennis competition for store employees was held here. A photo exhibition was held on "May 1st," and celebration singing and dancing parties will continue to be held on the following evenings.
    Zigong Salt Field Workers' Sanatorium
    The Zigong Salt Field Workers' Sanatorium in Sichuan Province received its first guests on March 21st this year.
    The newly built sanatorium building is elegant and beautiful with its vermilion eaves and sky-blue windows. The newly planted fruit trees are blooming with bright flowers. The tender green grass seedlings are growing vigorously. The sanatorium faces the factory area with its numerous well-arranged stoves and a magnificent view. Backed by green grass, secluded forests and a large worker hospital, it is especially uplifting and refreshing. The rest room is furnished with many soft new sofas. The reading room is filled with thousands of books. The recreation room has a variety of recreational instruments. The clean rooms are equipped with comfortable wire beds.... All this moved the model workers who came here for recuperation very much.
    Two Workers' Sanatoriums
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Qiqihar Railway Administration will build two workers' sanatoriums in Qiqihar City and Zhalantun this year.
    Both sanatoriums are designed according to Soviet medical science principles. The Qiqihar Sanatorium has an area of more than 5,100 square meters and can accommodate 150 beds. It is also equipped with a club, library, physical therapy (hydrotherapy, electrotherapy) clinic and solarium. The Zhalantun Sanatorium has an area of more than 3,400 square meters and can accommodate 160 beds. The lighting, ventilation, and ventilation equipment in both sanatoriums are suitable for patients to recuperate, and the appearance of the buildings is also very beautiful.
    The environment of both sanatoriums is very beautiful. The Qiqihar Sanatorium is located near Liu Garden on the bank of the Nenjiang River, and the surrounding scenery is very beautiful. The Zhalantun Sanatorium is located near the Mingyue River, and clear streams flow past both sides of the sanatorium. There are beautiful scenic forests nearby. Those who come here for recuperation can boat and fish in the summer, and ice skate and ski in the winter, which is very beneficial to the patients' recuperation.
    Another 5,000 Workers in Shanghai Move into New Housing
    This spring, hundreds of brand-new buildings have appeared on the green fields near the factory areas in Shanghai's Hudong, Huxi, Hunan, and Pudong areas. Another 5,000 workers in Shanghai will get new housing and move into these buildings.
    Most of these buildings are adjacent to the 20,000 households of housing built in 1952. They are all three-story buildings, with four families living on each floor. Each floor has six bedrooms and a large kitchen, two flush toilets, a bathroom, and a laundry room. Each floor has a balcony for enjoying the cool and drying clothes. A considerable amount of space is left between each building for planting trees and flowers and laying turf. Five of them will each have a primary school, so that workers' children can attend school nearby. Cooperatives, small vegetable markets, coal briquette warehouses, and family service stations will also be opened in some places.
    Now, more than half of these buildings have been completed, and many workers' families have moved into the new housing one after another.
    The Wuhu Match Factory's Nursery
    The nursery of the Wuhu Match Factory in Anhui is getting better and better.
    The nursery was established in 1950. Before it was established, mothers were worried! It's okay for families with grandmothers, who can bring their children to breastfeed every day, but for families with no one to take care of them, the mothers would bring their children and put them in the workshop. Sometimes when the children cried, it would disturb everyone. When female worker Chen Yulan gave birth to her first child, the factory had not yet established a nursery. Her grandmother brought the child to the factory every day to breastfeed. The grandmother was old and the road was far away, so it was very tiring to send the child to the factory every day. So Chen Yulan stopped working and went home. After the nursery was established, she returned to the factory. Now, she has given birth to another baby and put it in the nursery.
    When the nursery was first established, the equipment was poor, with only a few cradles, and the house was small and dark. With the development of production, the nursery equipment is becoming more and more complete. There are small stools, small tables, and small wooden cars to sit on. Last year, ten small wooden beds were bought, and this year, ten small iron beds were bought. They are preparing to buy small mosquito nets! The house has also been changed to a new one.

    逐步改善劳动环境发展生产
    一座美丽的“五一”花园
    国营上海电机厂“五一”花园已正式开放了。这座花园是利用空地开辟的，园内有一条清静的小河，河畔有茅亭、假山和石凳，还有青嫩的杨柳等各种树木。
    这座花园是根据上海电机厂一九五四年第一季度集体合同中的规定修建起来的。上海电机厂离上海市区较远，厂的附近缺少文化娱乐活动场所，所以该厂在生产发展的基础上修建了这个花园。工人们在紧张的劳动过后，可以到这里来休息、娱乐。
    三座新型太阳灯浴室
    鹤岗矿务局在东山、兴山、南山三个矿井修建的三座新型太阳灯浴室，四月二十三日已正式开放。这些太阳灯浴室是按照苏联顿巴斯煤矿太阳灯浴室的标准设计建筑的，内有更衣室、干燥室、机械洗衣室、浴室、太阳灯室、保健室、医疗室……等部分。浴室有淋浴和池浴，医疗室有内科、外科和眼科。工人下班后，戴上有色眼镜，用太阳灯照射片刻，可以增进身体的新陈代谢作用，恢复体力。在开放典礼大会上，工人纷纷感谢共产党的关怀，决心加紧生产完成国家计划。
    开办营养食堂
    重庆市公共汽车公司的工会组织，去年三月份在小龙坎为职工们开办了一所营养食堂。身体衰弱的职工，可以享受到营养待遇。在营养期间，每人每月吃十五万元的伙食，本人只出七万元。另外八万元由工会劳保金开支，行政上每天补助半磅牛奶。凡是经过营养的职工，身体健康状况都有好转，有的还由衰弱变得强健了。如该公司劳动工资科办事员戴平同志，经过七个月的营养后，体重增加了十点四七磅，长得红光满面，精神饱满。一年多来，已有二百六十八名职工在营养食堂里改善了身体健康状况。
    泉州市的工人俱乐部
    福建泉州市的工人俱乐部已日益成为泉州市工人文化生活上不可缺少的一个场所，每当周末晚上走进这里，你可以看到这里到处充满着欢乐的人群。这里拥有八千多册图书，有二千二百多种连环画，有六十种报刊杂志，有二十多种如风琴、手提琴、胡琴等乐器，有四台乒乓球桌，还有众多的军棋、红旗竞赛棋、扑克牌等文娱器具设备。自今年元旦成立以来，到这里来参加活动的职工，平均每天出入在一千人以上。
    俱乐部曾经演出了闽南最流行的“陈三五娘”和“跳鼓”等剧目，演出了工人自演的“一担米”
  “雨后”等短剧。在“五一”前这里举办了店员工人的乒乓球比赛，“五一”举办了图片展览，以后几天晚上还继续举行了庆祝歌舞晚会。
    自贡盐场工人疗养所
    四川自贡盐场工人疗养所今年三月二十一日第
  一次接待了它的贵宾。
    新修的疗养大楼嵌着朱红的屋檐和天蓝的窗户，显得幽雅漂亮；新栽培的果树正盛开着鲜艳的花朵；嫩绿的草地幼苗正在欣欣向荣地生长；疗养所远对着井灶林立、景色壮丽的工厂区，背后衬着碧草幽林和宽大的工人医院，格外使人感到心胸开阔、精神爽快。休息室内摆着许多松软的新沙发；阅览室里堆藏着上千册图书；文娱室有各种文娱乐器；洁净的房间内放着舒适的钢丝床……。这一切，使来到这里休养的劳动模范们，都非常感动。
    两座职工疗养院
    黑龙江省工会联合会和齐齐哈尔铁路管理局，今年将在齐齐哈尔市和扎兰屯修建两座职工疗养院。
    这两座疗养院都是按着苏联医疗科学原理设计的。齐齐哈尔疗养院面积有五千一百多平方公尺，可容纳一百五十个床位，并附设俱乐部、图书室、物理疗法（水疗、电疗）诊疗室和日光浴室等。扎兰屯疗养院面积有三千四百余平方公尺，可容纳一百六十个床位。这两座疗养院在采光、通风及换气设备上都适合病人疗养，院舍的外观也很秀丽。
    这两座疗养院的环境都非常美丽。齐齐哈尔疗养院位于嫩江江畔的刘园附近，周围景致十分幽美。扎兰屯疗养院位于明月河傍，清澈的溪水从院舍两侧流过，附近有美丽的风景林。两院的休养者在夏天可以划船、钓鱼，在冬天可以溜冰和滑雪，对病人的疗养是十分有益的。
    上海又有五千工人住上新住宅
    今春，在上海沪东、沪西、沪南和浦东等接近工厂区的绿色田野上，出现了数百幢崭新的楼房，上海又将有五千工人得到新住宅，搬进这些楼房里来住。
    这些楼房大部和一九五二年建筑的二万户住宅毗连。它们全是三层楼房，每层可住四家，共有六间卧室和一个宽大的厨房，两个抽水马桶间，一个浴室和洗衣间。每层阳台，可供纳凉、晒衣之用。每幢房屋之间都留有相当大的场地，以备栽种树木花卉和铺盖草地。其中五处将各设小学一所，工人子弟可以就近上学。有几处还要开办合作社、小菜场、煤球仓库、家庭服务站等。
    现在，这些楼房半数以上已经完成，许多工人家庭已陆续迁入了新住宅。
    芜湖火柴厂的托儿所
    安徽芜湖火柴厂的托儿所越办越好了。
    托儿所是一九五零年办起来的。没有办以前，当妈妈的可操心啦！家里有老婆婆的还好，每天能把孩子抱来吃奶，家里没人照顾的，妈妈就把孩子带来放在车间里，孩子有时哭起来，吵得大家都不安宁。女工陈玉兰生第一个孩子的时候，厂里还没成立托儿所，孩子天天由她老婆婆抱来吃奶，老婆婆年纪大了，路又远，天天送孩子来厂挺累的，所以陈玉兰就停工回家了。托儿所办起来后，她又回到厂里来了，现在，她又生了个小宝宝放在托儿所里了。
    托儿所刚办起来的时候，设备差，只有几个摇窝，房子又小又暗，随着生产的发展，现在托儿所设备越来越齐全了，有小凳、小桌和坐的小木车，去年买了十张小木床，今年又买了十张小铁床，正准备买小帐子哩！房子也换成新的了。
