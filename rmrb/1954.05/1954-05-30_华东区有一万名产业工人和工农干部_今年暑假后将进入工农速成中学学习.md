    10,000 Industrial Workers and Worker-Peasant Cadres in East China to Enter Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools After Summer Vacation This Year
    10,000 industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres in East China will enter workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools after the summer vacation this year. In order to accommodate this group of worker-peasant students, in addition to the original sixteen workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools in the region, nine new ones have been established this year. This year, a total of more than 89,000 square meters of school buildings have been newly built in workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools throughout the region. Some of these school buildings are still being designed, while others have already started construction, and most of them can be completed before the start of the school year.
    The Education Bureau and Higher Education Bureau of the East China Administrative Council, and the Education Departments and Bureaus of the provincial and municipal People's Governments are currently actively preparing for the enrollment work of the workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools and the allocation of cadres and teachers. More than 110 staff members and teachers with university degrees have been transferred from universities and colleges in East China to participate in the teaching work of the workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools next semester. More than 60 people transferred from various universities and colleges in Shanghai are concentrating on studying at the East China Accelerated Experimental School, studying how to address the characteristics of worker-peasant students, and preparing for the courses they will be teaching.

    华东区有一万名产业工人和工农干部
    今年暑假后将进入工农速成中学学习
    华东区有一万名产业工人和工农干部将在今年暑假后进入工农速成中学学习。为接纳这批工农学生入学，全区除原有十六所工农速成中学外，今年又新设立九所。全区工农速成中学今年共增建校舍八万九千多平方公尺。这批校舍有的正在设计，有的已经动工，大体上都可在开学前完工。
    华东行政委员会教育局、高等教育局和各省、市人民政府教育厅、局，目前正在积极筹备工农速成中学的招生工作和干部、师资的调配工作。华东区高等学校已抽调出具有大学程度的职员、教师等一百一十多名，他们将参加下学期工农速成中学的教学工作。上海各高等学校抽调出的六十多人，正集中在华东速成实验学校学习，研究如何针对工农学生的特点，着手准备他们将要担任的课程。（新华社）
