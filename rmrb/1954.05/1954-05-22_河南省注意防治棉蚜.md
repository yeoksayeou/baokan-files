    Henan Province Pays Attention to Preventing and Controlling Cotton Aphids
    Henan Province has begun to prevent and control cotton aphids. Due to the warmer weather last winter, the mortality rate of overwintering cotton pests was very low. After the spring, the aphids reproduced early and quickly. Farmers in various places attach great importance to the prevention and control of cotton aphids. The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guo Wangdu Township, Anyang, thoroughly inspected the cotton aphids in the fields. On the one hand, they prepared more than 1,700 catties of cotton oil mud and 120 catties of tobacco leaves, as well as 25 sprayers. On the other hand, they held a meeting to study the technology of thinning seedlings and replanting combined with pest control: when thinning seedlings, pay attention to removing cotton seedlings and diseased plants with aphids. If the cotton seedlings to be kept have aphids, spray them with medicated liquid. If there are double plants, keep the double plants for transplanting. Then, the cooperative trained 39 members to carry out aphid control work. It is expected that within five days, hundreds of acres of cotton fields with aphids in the whole cooperative will be treated once. The Xu Bingchen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangcheng County, based on past experience, organized its members to effectively control aphids in more than seven acres of cotton fields with tobacco leaf lime water in half a day. After the Ningling County Farm discovered cotton aphids, the county leaders immediately studied and instructed various districts to pay attention to prevention and control. In order to protect the healthy growth of cotton seedlings, the Henan Provincial People's Government has issued instructions requiring all localities to conduct a general aphid control work on cotton fields before the wheat harvest.

    河南省注意防治棉蚜
    河南省开始防治棉花蚜虫。由于去冬天气较暖，棉花害虫越冬死亡率很小，入春后，蚜虫繁殖早而且快。各地农民对防治棉蚜都很重视，安阳郭王度乡先锋农业生产合作社，深入田间检查了棉蚜后，一面准备了棉油泥一千七百多斤，烟叶一百二十斤，喷雾器二十五架；一面召开会议，研究了间苗补苗结合治虫的技术：间苗时就注意把带蚜虫的棉苗和病株剔除，应留棉苗如有蚜虫便用药水喷杀，有双株处则留双株以便移苗。接着合作社便训练了三十九个社员，开展治蚜工作，预计五天内全社数百亩有蚜虫的棉田，都能除治一遍。襄城县徐丙辰农业生产合作社，根据往年经验，组织社员用烟叶石灰水半天就有效地除治了七亩多棉田的蚜虫。宁陵县农场发现棉蚜后，县的领导上当即研究和指示各区注意防治。为保护棉花幼苗健旺生长，河南省人民政府已发出指示，要求各地都在麦收前对棉田普遍进行一次防治蚜虫工作。　（吕建中）
