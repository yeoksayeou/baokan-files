Farmers in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province Improve Farming Techniques to Strive for a Greater Harvest This Year

Farmers in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province are fully utilizing last year's increased production experience to strive for an even greater harvest this year.

Last year, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region achieved its largest harvest since liberation due to the application of advanced production-increasing experience and improved farming techniques. The average yield per mu in the entire region reached more than 430 jin, an increase of 15% compared to 1952. This year, farmers in various regions are fully utilizing and developing last year's experience in spring plowing and production, striving to obtain an even greater harvest than last year. In terms of rice cultivation techniques, plowing and harrowing have generally increased by one time compared to last year, generally reaching three plows and three harrows, and agricultural production cooperatives and better mutual aid groups plowed and harrowed four or five times before transplanting seedlings. The most prominent thing is that all regions seized the opportunity of rainy weather in mid-to-late April to plow dry land, and the entire region basically eliminated hard-packed soil by the end of April. In terms of fertilization, both the quality and quantity have improved compared to last year. The entire region generally uses about 20 loads per mu, and some mountainous areas have also broken with convention this year and transported fertilizer uphill. Uniform and dense planting has been widely promoted in various regions, with dense planting of rice fields accounting for more than 20% in Yongshun and Fenghuang counties. There are many mountain fields in the area, and the climate is relatively cold. Drought and insect pests have been serious throughout the years. Last year, some areas reaped early harvests by planting early, which reduced disasters. This year, various regions generally sowed about a week earlier. In order to further do a good job in drought prevention, the entire region has dug more than 13,000 "cattle sleeping ponds," which can irrigate more than 20,000 mu of land. Including all other water conservancy projects, a total of more than 64,000 mu of rice fields can be newly irrigated.

　　改进耕作技术争取今年更大丰收
    湖南省湘西苗族自治区农民充分运用去年增产经验，争取今年更大丰收。
    湘西苗族自治区去年由于运用先进增产经验改进耕作技术，获得解放以来最大一次丰收，全区每亩平均产量达到四百三十多斤，比一九五二年增了一成半。今年各地农民在春耕生产中充分运用并发展了去年的经验，争取获得比去年更大的丰收。在稻谷耕作技术方面，普遍较去年多犁耙一次，一般达到三犁三耙，农业生产合作社和较好的互助组犁耙了四、五次才插秧。最突出的是各地都在四月中、下旬抢雨耕犁了旱田，全区在四月底基本上消灭了板田。施肥方面，质和量都比去年提高，全区一般每亩都在二十挑左右，部分山区今年也打破惯例，运肥上坡。各地普遍推广了均匀密植，永顺、凤凰两县密植稻田占百分之二十以上。该区山田较多，气候较冷，历年旱、虫灾害严重，去年部分地区早种早收，减轻了灾害，今年各地普遍提早播种一星期左右。为了进一步做好防旱工作，全区共挖了“牛睏塘”一万三千多口，可灌田二万余亩，连其他所有水利工程在内，共可增灌稻田六万四千多亩。
