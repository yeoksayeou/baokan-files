    The Work and Life of a Worker in Democratic Germany
    The Riesa Steel Plant in the German Democratic Republic is one of the largest and best-equipped metallurgical complexes in the German Democratic Republic. It has modern steelmaking plants, rolling mills, and steel pipe plants; thousands of workers work and live here.
    The factory pays great attention to the cultural life and welfare of the workers, and has built a new staff and workers' home and a new canteen with modern equipment, expanded the clinic, and established a night sanatorium, kindergarten, maternity station, new-style practice workshops, and two apprentice dormitories, each with one hundred beds. In addition, a beautiful club and sports field have been built.
    The work and life of the workers at the Riesa Steel Plant is an epitome of the work and life of all workers in the German Democratic Republic. We can use the example of the work and life of Herbert Waschke, a production team leader and meritorious activist in the factory, to illustrate this.
    Waschke told us about his simple experience:
    "I have been working at the Riesa Steel Plant since 1949. When I first came to the factory, I was a complete layman; I used to work on the railway. Because of my diligence in learning, I have mastered the theory and production technology that a rolling mill worker should understand. In order to train myself to become a foreman, I studied a two-year foreman course at the factory's affiliated technical school. Not long ago, I took the foreman's examination and received a grade of 'Excellent'. This proves that each of us can acquire the skills and knowledge he needs as long as he studies hard. Today, I am able to fully grasp the entire process of steel rolling and related production issues with complete confidence; this is helpful for the production performance of our production team."
    In the labor competition in the fourth quarter of 1953, Waschke's production team over-rolled 5,014 tons of steel, thus laying a good foundation for carrying out the competition in the entire rolling mill. In this competition, his production team maintained the "Karl Marx" Red Flag from beginning to end and was recognized as the winner of the entire factory. Due to their outstanding achievements, Waschke's production team was awarded the glorious title of "Walter Ulbricht" production team on January 19 this year.
  Herbert Waschke and his production team are not only outstanding in production, but also in labor organization, in strengthening the unity and cooperation of the production team, and in ideological work, they have set an example for the various production teams in the rolling mill.
    Waschke plays a leading role in all aspects of his production team. He constantly studies and creates new working methods to continuously improve production work. He is not only with his team members in diligent work, but also often with them in his spare time. He cares about the private lives of his team members. He is always their loyal friend and sincere helper.
    How does Waschke arrange his life and use his spare time?
    He said: "I like football, and I often play football with the members of the production team. When everyone is free on Sundays, we often go to Dresden or Leipzig to watch football matches. I also often go to concerts and plays with everyone. I spend part of my spare time reading advanced books. To a large extent, the achievements I have made in my work should be attributed to the knowledge these books have given me."
    He also talked about his family life: "My wife used to work in the factory too. I have two children—a boy and a girl. Every day after work, our whole family spends these moments together in our comfortable home. I have a beautiful three-room house. Our life is already very good, especially since our government and the Socialist Unity Party have implemented the new policy, our lives have become even better. Every year, I always spend my holidays with my family in the beautiful Thuringian Forest, in the Erz Mountains, or in the sanatoriums organized by the Free German Trade Union Federation. For example, last year we rested on the east coast for several weeks. The reason why we can get such welfare today is because a large sum of money has been allocated from the factory committee and trade union funds as subsidies for our working people's holiday travel. For example, in 1953, 25,320 marks were allocated from our factory committee’s fund, and the trade union also subsidized 8,000 marks."
    Herbert Waschke is a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and a member of the factory party committee. He actively worked for the party. Waschke said: "The party has given and continues to give me the strength to achieve these achievements and continue to expand them. What I am most concerned about now is the peaceful solution of the German question, which must be based on the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. This is not only my hope, but also the goal for which we German workers are striving."

    一个民主德国工人的工作和生活
    德意志民主共和国　威利·朗格里萨钢铁厂是德意志民主共和国规模最大和设备最好的冶金联合工厂之一。它有着现代化设备的炼钢厂、轧钢厂和钢管厂；在这里工作和生活的有数千名工人。
    工厂十分注意工人的文化生活和福利，并为此兴建了一所新的职工之家和一所有着现代化设备的新的食堂，扩充了医疗所，建立了夜间疗养所、幼儿园、接生站、新式的实习工场、两幢各设有一百张床位的学徒宿舍。此外，还建立了一所漂亮的俱乐部和运动场。
    里萨钢铁厂的工人们的工作和生活是德意志民主共和国全体工人的工作和生活的一个缩写。我们可以用该厂的一个生产队长、功勋积极分子赫伯特·瓦许克的工作和生活的例子来说明。
    瓦许克为我们讲了他的简单的经历：
    “我从一九四九年起就在里萨钢铁厂工作。我刚来工厂的时候，完全是一个外行，从前我是在铁路上工作的。由于自己勤于学习，我已掌握了一个轧钢工人应该懂得的理论和生产技术。为了把自己培养成为一个领班，我在工厂附设的技术学校里念了两年的领班课程。不久以前我参加了领班的考试，得到的分数是‘优良’。这证明，我们每一个人只要努力学习，就能够获得他所需要的各种技能和知识。今天我已经能够完全有把握地掌握轧钢的全部过程和有关生产方面的问题；这对于我们生产队的生产成绩是有帮助的。”
    在一九五三年第四季度的劳动竞赛中，瓦许克的生产队超额轧出了五千零十四吨钢，因而为在整个轧钢厂中开展竞赛奠定了良好的基础。在这次竞赛中，他的生产队自始至终保持了“卡尔·马克思”红旗，被公认为全厂的优胜者。由于他们的优异成绩，瓦许克生产队在今年一月十九日获得了“瓦尔特·乌布利希”生产队的光荣称号。
  赫伯特·瓦许克和他的生产队不仅在生产方面成绩卓越，而且在劳动组织、在加强生产队的团结合作和思想工作方面，也给轧钢厂的各个生产队树立了一个榜样。
    瓦许克在他的生产队的各方面都起着带头的作用。他不断地研究和创造新的工作方法，使生产工作不断获得改进。他不仅在勤劳的工作中和他的队员们在一起，而且在工余之暇也经常和他们在一起，他关心队员们的私人生活。他始终是他们的忠实的朋友和真诚的帮助者。
    瓦许克是怎样安排自己的生活、利用他的工余时间的呢？
    他说：“我是爱好足球的，我常常和生产队的队员们一起踢足球。星期日大家有空的时候，我们常常到德累斯顿或莱比锡去看足球比赛。我也时常和大家一起去听音乐会和看戏。我把一部分空暇的时间用来阅读先进的书籍，我在自己的工作方面所获得的成就，在很大程度上应该归功于这些书籍所给我的知识。”
    他还谈到他的家庭生活：“我的妻子从前也曾在工厂里工作过。我有两个孩子——一男一女。每天下班以后，我们全家人就在舒适的家中共同度过这些时刻。我有一幢三间房的漂亮住宅。我们的日子已经过得很不错了，特别是我们的政府和统一社会党实行新方针以来，我们的生活更好了。每年我总要和家里人一起，在美丽的绍林吉亚森林里、在爱尔兹山、或者在自由德国工会联合会所举办的休养所里度过我的假期。例如去年我们在东海岸休息了几个星期的时间。我们今天所以能够得到这样的福利，是因为工厂委员会和工会组织的基金中拨出了一大笔款项来作为我们劳动人民假期旅行的补助金。例如一九五三年从我们工厂委员会的基金中拨出了二万五千三百二十马克，而工会也补助了八千个马克。”
    赫伯特·瓦许克是德国统一社会党党员，并且是工厂党委的委员。他积极地为党做了工作。瓦许克说：“党过去和现在都给我以力量，使我能够得到这些成绩并继续扩大这些成绩。现在我最关心的是德国问题的和平解决，这种解决必须是建立一个和平、民主和统一的德国。这不仅是我的希望，而且也是我们德国工人为之努力斗争的目标。”
