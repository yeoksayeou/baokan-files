	Guangzhou City's Elementary Schools for the Boat People
	Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Education Bureau
	On the Pearl River in Guangzhou, there are more than 60,000 working people engaged in water transportation, fishing, and other occupations. Before liberation, they suffered bullying and oppression by reactionary rulers and imperialists, and they had absolutely no social status. They lived on the water all year round, and there were many restrictions on going ashore. In addition, they had to endure heavy extortion and exploitation from feudal dock bosses, foremen, and big and small bullies. At that time, the boat people had no opportunity for education at all. Of the more than 60,000 boat people in the entire Pearl River area, illiteracy exceeded three-quarters of the total population. Although the Kuomintang reactionary government had hypocritically opened a central national school on the water, few of the students in the school were children of the boat people. Many of the boat people's children did not even have enough to eat and wear, so how could their families afford to send them to school!
	After liberation, the political status of the boat people improved. Representatives of the boat people themselves participated in the Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress, the district people's congresses, and the women's congresses. In 1950 and 1951, in conjunction with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and other work, struggles against local bullies were launched at various docks, and the bullies and foremen who were oppressing them were thoroughly eliminated, and the shackles imposed on them by these bad guys were also completely removed.
	As the political status of the boat people continued to improve, their demands for culture and education became increasingly urgent. In 1950, at the first Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress, the representatives of the boat people put forward their cultural demands, and the meeting decided to suggest that the government establish a Pearl River District Cultural Center and open a Pearl River District Waterborne Elementary School. Soon, the Waterborne First Elementary School was established outside Aozhou Street in Henan. However, at that time, because some of the boat people did not fully understand the relationship between the People's Government and them, they took a wait-and-see attitude towards the school. Initially, they were afraid to send their children to school, believing that schools that did not charge tuition were not good schools; others were afraid that their children would be bullied if they went to school on land. After the principal and teachers learned about these ideological concerns of the masses, they went deep into the boat households to publicize and repeatedly explained the People's Government's concern and emphasis on the cultural life of the boat people, the benefits of going to school, etc.; the district government cadres also assisted the school in publicity and enrollment work. As a result, more than 30 children were mobilized to enroll, and the school opened. The official opening of the Waterborne First Elementary School was an exciting event in the lives of the boat people. A grand opening ceremony was held at that time, and representatives of the boat people, the head of the Pearl River District, and cadres from relevant leading organs all attended the ceremony.
	During the summer vacation of that year, in order to get closer to the masses, the teachers changed into the black Tang suits commonly worn by the masses. They went deep into the boat households to visit and publicize, exposing the crimes of the bullies. In this way, the teachers approached the masses, established a relatively close relationship with the masses, and understood their living conditions and thoughts. At the same time, in conjunction with mass work, they also used various opportunities to publicize the benefits of attending elementary school. As a result, at the beginning of the first semester of 1950, the number of students increased to more than 160, nearly four times more than before.
	In the autumn of 1950, in order to take care of the enrollment of the children of the boat people in the eastern part of the Pearl River, the Municipal Education Bureau used a large boat as a school building on the Dongdi River and opened the Pearl River District Waterborne Second Elementary School. When the school enrolled students, it launched a publicity and explanation campaign to the masses. The masses had a preliminary understanding of the school, and 50 people registered on the first day. Later, the teachers learned that some of the masses were hesitant and afraid to sign up because they were afraid of exams. Therefore, it was decided not to conduct entrance exams and to continue the publicity work. By the time school started, more than 300 children had enrolled. In order to further meet the requirements of the boat people for their children to attend school, the Waterborne Third and Fourth Elementary Schools were opened in early 1951. Last September, in order to facilitate the enrollment of the children of the boat people in the Nantidi area, the Waterborne Fifth Elementary School was opened near Tianzi Wharf. At that time, the masses in this area were eager to solve the problem of their children's enrollment. When they saw that the school had enrolled more than 200 children, they happily said: "The People's Government really takes care of us!" Last autumn, the Municipal Education Bureau changed the private Ersha Elementary School into the Waterborne Sixth Elementary School based on the opinions of the Pearl River District People's Congress.
	In the past four years, the number of waterborne elementary schools has grown from one to six, and the number of students has grown from more than 30 to more than 2,300. Now, most of the boat people's children have gone to school, and they are receiving a good primary education. Among them, the First Elementary School and the Second Elementary School have successively established Young Pioneers teams.
	In order to meet the requirements of the boat people as much as possible, and to allow their children to go to school without affecting the family's production work, the People's Government has also added "night classes" to the Waterborne First, Third, and Fourth Elementary Schools, and "noon classes" to the Waterborne Second Elementary School. Because the teachers improved their teaching work based on the characteristics of these students and gave the students assistance in various aspects, the students' cultural level gradually improved. At present, "night classes" have developed to nine classes with more than 300 students; "noon classes" also have two classes with more than 50 students. The "night classes" and "noon classes" have solved the contradiction between the students' study time and production work, and the boat people are very happy.
	The waterborne elementary schools have carried out some educational activities. For example, in order to eliminate the estrangement between the boat people and the land people, a water-land elementary school get-together was held. When the students of the waterborne elementary school came to the land school, the students lined up to welcome them. At the welcoming party, teachers and students talked about how the water and land people are one family, and that the different status of the water and land people in the past was caused by the reactionary government. After the meeting, the land elementary school also presented a banner to the waterborne elementary school, expressing that everyone should unite and help each other in the future. The teachers of the waterborne school care about and love the children of the boat people very much. Many teachers send students to the dock when school is over, and carry young students home when the tide is high. Some students often miss classes because their parents do not pay attention to their studies or because they undertake too much family labor. In addition to giving make-up lessons to students who miss classes and mobilizing students to help each other, the teachers also visit parents on the boats to understand their situation and patiently persuade them not to let their children miss classes casually. Through the efforts of the teachers, the phenomenon of absenteeism among senior students has decreased.
	The teachers are enthusiastic about teaching and caring for the students, and the students and their parents also care about the school, love the teachers, and thank the People's Government. When the first class of students graduated from the Waterborne First Elementary School, they wrote on the banner they gave to their alma mater as a souvenir: "Graduated, never forget the Communist Party!" When the school was building a sports field, the boat people took the initiative to help spread sand; the school building of the Waterborne Second Elementary School is a large wooden boat. Whenever there is wind and rain, it needs to be anchored. The school does not have enough manpower, and the nearby masses often come to help. They treat the school like their own home. The education of the children of the boat people in Guangzhou is developing vigorously thanks to the care and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and the joint efforts of the teachers and the boat people.

    广州市水上人民的小学
    广州市人民政府教育局
    在广州市珠江水面上，有六万多从事水上交通运输和捕鱼等职业的劳动人民。解放前，他们受尽了反动统治者和帝国主义分子的欺凌和压迫，他们完全没有社会地位。他们长居水上，上岸要受到许多限制。此外，他们还要忍受着封建码头主、把头以及大小恶霸的重重敲诈和剥削。那时候，水上人民是根本没有受教育的机会的。珠江全区六万多水上人民，文盲超过了人口总数的四分之三。国民党反动政府虽然也曾伪善地在水面开办过一所中心国民学校；但是，学校里的学生却没有几个是水上劳动人民的子女。很多水上人民的孩子，连衣食都不全，家里那有经济能力供他们上学呢！
    解放以后，水上人民的政治地位提高了。广州市的各界人民代表会议、区各界人民代表会议及妇女代表会议，都有水上人民自己的代表参加。一九五○年及一九五一年，结合镇压反革命等工作，先后开展了各码头的反恶霸斗争，压在他们头上的恶霸、把头被彻底清除了，这些坏家伙给予他们的束缚也彻底解除了。
    水上人民由于政治地位的不断提高，对于文化教育的要求也日益迫切。一九五○年，广州市第一届各界人民代表会议上，水上人民的代表提出了他们文化上的要求，会议决定建议政府建立珠江区文化馆，开办珠江区水上小学。不久，水上第一小学在河南鳌洲外街创办起来了。但在当时，由于水上人民中有些人还不十分了解人民政府和他们的关系，对学校采取了观望怀疑的态度。最初，他们不敢送孩子入学，他们认为，不收学费的学校不是好学校；还有些人怕自己子女到陆上读书受人家欺侮。校长和老师知道群众的这些思想顾虑以后，便深入到各艇户去宣传，反复讲解人民政府对水上人民的文化生活的关怀和重视，入学读书的好处等等；区政府的干部也协助学校进行宣传和招生工作。结果，动员了三十多个儿童入学，学校开学了。水上第一小学的正式开学，是水上人民生活中一件令人兴奋的事，当时曾举行了隆重的开学典礼，水上人民代表、珠江区区长及各有关领导机关都派有干部参加典礼。
    这年暑假，老师们为了接近群众，都改穿群众惯用的黑色唐装衣服。他们深入艇户访问、宣传，揭发恶霸的罪行。这样，老师们接近了群众，和群众建立了比较密切的关系，了解了他们的生活和思想情况。同时，结合群众工作，他们还利用了种种机会，宣传了进小学读书的好处。于是在一九五○年度第一学期开学时，学生就增加到一百六十多人，比原来增加了将近四倍。
    一九五○年秋季，市教育局为了照顾珠江东面的水上人民子女入学，在东堤河边用一只大船作校舍，开设了珠江区水上第二小学。学校在招生时，向群众展开了宣传解释工作。群众对学校有了初步认识，第一天登记的就有五十人。后来教师们了解到群众中有些因为怕考试而迟疑不决，不敢报名。于是决定不进行入学考试，并继续展开了宣传工作。到开学时，共有三百多儿童入学。为进一步满足水上人民子女入学的要求，一九五一年初，又开办了水上第三、第四小学。去年九月，为了便利南堤一带水上人民子女入学，在天字码头附近，又开办了水上第五小学。当时，这一带的群众正急于解决他们子女的入学问题，一见学校招收了二百多孩子入学，他们都高兴地说：人民政府真照顾我们了！去年秋天，市教育局根据珠江区各界人民代表会议的意见，将私立二沙小学改为水上第六小学。
    四年来，水上小学由一所发展到六所，学生由三十多人发展到二千三百多人。现在，大部分水上人民的孩子都已经上学，他们正在受着良好的初级教育。其中第一小学和第二小学并先后建立了少年先锋队。
    人民政府为了尽可能地满足水上人民的要求，让他们的孩子能够上学又不致影响家庭的生产工作，还在水上第一、三、四小学增设了“夜间班”，在水上第二小学增设了“中午班”。由于老师们根据这些学生的特点改进了教学工作，给了学生各方面的帮助，学生的文化程度逐步提高。目前，“夜间班”已发展到九班，共三百多学生；“中午班”也有两班，共五十多人。“夜间班”和“中午班”解决了学生的学习时间和生产工作的矛盾，水上人民都非常高兴。
    水上小学的学校进行了一些有教育意义的活动。例如，为了消除水上人民和陆上人民的隔阂，曾举行了水陆小学联欢活动。当水上小学同学到陆上学校时，同学们列队欢迎。在欢迎会上还由教师和同学讲了水陆人民是一家，过去水陆人民不同的地位，是反动政府造成的。会后陆上小学还赠送锦旗给水上小学，表示今后大家都要团结互助。水上学校的老师们很关心和爱护水上人民的孩子，很多老师在放学的时候，送学生到码头去，水涨的时候，还背年幼的学生回家。有些学生，因为家长不重视他们的学业，或因为承担过多的家庭劳动，经常缺课。老师们除了给缺课的学生补课，动员学生们互相帮助外，还到艇上访问家长，了解他们的情况，并耐心说服他们不要随便让子女缺课。经过老师的努力，高年级学生的缺课现象减少了。
    老师们热心教学和爱护学生，学生和他们的家长也关心学校、爱护老师和感谢人民政府。水上第一小学的第一届学生毕业时，在送给母校留念的锦旗上写着：“毕业了，不忘共产党！”学校修建体育场时，水上人民主动来帮助铺沙；水上第二小学的校舍是一只大木船，每次遇到风雨的时候，需要下锚，学校人力不足，附近的群众常常来帮助。他们对学校像自己的家一样。广州市水上人民子女的教育，由于党和人民政府的关怀和领导，由于老师们和水上人民的共同努力，在蓬勃地发展着。
