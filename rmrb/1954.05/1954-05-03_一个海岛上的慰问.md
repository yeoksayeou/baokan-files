    A Visit on an Island
    Xiao Jiang
      March 8th was overcast, but the sea was calm. It was our last day of visits at sea, and we arrived at a very remote island. In the past, this island was truly a "deserted island" in the truest sense of the word. Not only was it isolated overseas, but it was also desolate and uninhabited. There were no residents or houses; only isolated mountains, wilderness, tall grass, and large rocks. But now, it has completely changed. As soon as we arrived, we were surrounded by People's Liberation Army soldiers, who welcomed us to their club. The club was newly built, and we could still smell the fresh paint. The walls were covered with colorful pictures and maps. The instructor excitedly told us about the history of the island's development and changes.
    "Since we liberated this island, our hands have never been idle. We must defend it, build it, turn the barren island into a paradise, and settle down here. There are difficulties. Without tools, we used stones to smash stones, and our hands as trowels. The original grass shacks have become the stone houses they are today. When the storm season comes, supplies are cut off, and we often go ten days or half a month without eating a grain of rice. So, we jump into the sea to find food to fill our stomachs in the raging waves. Water, drinkable fresh water, is the most precious thing on the island. What to do? Rely on transport from the mainland. How precious water is! We cherish every drop of water like a drop of blood. Often, a basin of water is used by dozens of people to wash their faces and brush their teeth. We even feel sorry for a drop of sweat that falls during labor!"
    The delegates listened and listened, and became a little thirsty. But everyone kept licking their lips. Although fragrant tea was on the table, no one wanted to take another sip. The instructor immediately noticed and said with a smile: "Drink it! Water shortage is a thing of the past. Now we have wells! Everyone felt that the difficulty of water shortage must be solved, so they started digging several water storage wells. When it rained, everyone used all kinds of furniture to collect water under the cliffs and eaves. When it snowed, everyone swept the clean snow into the wells. This way, we solved the problem of drinking water." At this time, a soldier from Zhejiang handed a cup of water to the representatives and said: "Taste it, it tastes even better than Longjing tea from our hometown!" The representative of the Volunteer Army drank and nodded, saying, "If the instructor hadn't told me, I really wouldn't have tasted that it was rainwater and snow water!"
  The soldiers' labor finally changed the face of the "deserted island." The scene of "tall grass as high as a person, and large stones everywhere" when they first arrived on the island has changed. Now, the island is just like the soldiers sing: "If you want to live, live on ×× Island, cherries in spring and dates in autumn, people live in buildings and sheep eat grass, and hundreds of birds often fly to the island!"
    Indeed, the island not only has many plants cultivated by the soldiers, but also animals raised by them. Speaking of this, people will talk about the sheep-herding expert Jiao Tongsheng. In the past three years, under his careful nurturing, he has bred from seven lambs to three hundred large sheep, which not only supply meat to the island but also support the fraternal troops on the outer islands. When they heard that we were coming, they specially slaughtered a big fat sheep! The dumplings were wrapped the night before, called "welcome dumplings."
    This day was International Women's Day, and the female comrades of our art troupe specially prepared needles and thread to mend clothes for the island guards. At the same time, they also went into the kitchen to offer their regards and help the cooks cook, wash pots, and wash dishes. After the meal, everyone sat down and talked. The cook, Lao Wang, said: "You are really like being at home, taking care of everything. To celebrate Women's Day, come, come..." Lao Wang said, took an apple from his bag, divided it into eight pieces, and said as he distributed them: "This is a Yantai apple, distributed during the New Year. I heard you were coming, so I didn't want to eat it. It's a small gift, but it's from my heart, Lao Wang. Try it!" After a pause, Lao Wang said again: "But, next time you come, you won't be eating apples from the mainland." He pointed to a row of saplings outside the window and said: "Look, those are the fruit trees we planted. I guarantee the fruits will be more fragrant and sweeter than these. Look over there! We are planning to build a garden, a zoo, and build roads! When that time comes, we might not call it ×× Island anymore, but ×× Park!" Lao Wang became more and more excited, and the representatives listened with fascination.
    At this time, wherever there were representatives, there were cordial conversations. In the east room, the Volunteer Army hero Zhu Yong was surrounded by a large group of island guards, asking her about the learning and guarding situation of the Volunteer Army in Korea. In the west room, the comrades of the art troupe surrounded Jiao Tongsheng, the island's sheep-herding expert, asking him to introduce their island life. Some representatives and island soldiers were sitting on the hillside where the grass buds were sprouting, listening to the representatives introduce the new atmosphere of the motherland's construction in the past four years. A soldier listened to the representatives' talks and said excitedly: "Our Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army must be twisted into one rope. You are on the front line in Korea, and we are on the border of the motherland, jointly defending the socialist construction of the motherland, and not allowing the enemy to invade it in the slightest!"
    Then a golden Chairman Mao badge was taken from the chest of the Volunteer Army hero and pinned on the soldier's chest. Two strong hands clasped tightly, clasped tightly, for a long, long time!
    When the lighthouse on the sea emitted its first ray of light, the night was hazy, and the representatives boarded the speedboat with reluctance. A burst of enthusiastic singing rose on the swaying sea: All rivers and streams return to the sea, red flowers and green leaves always have roots, flesh and blood separation is full of affection, revolutionary friendship is extremely important; we think of you day and night in Korea, thinking of our big brother, the People's Liberation Army, thousands of mountains and rivers come to comfort you, bringing a fiery heart; the People's Liberation Army, the Volunteer Army, two big trees with one root, the People's Liberation Army, the Volunteer Army, brothers of the same mother; you consolidate national defense and defend the border; we resist the US and aid Korea to protect peace, defend the border to protect peace, and protect the successful completion of socialist construction as soon as possible.
    When the crisp whistle sounded on the boat, the bow turned towards the mainland, and the sound of the engine starting, applause, and shouts resounded as one. The representatives and art troupe members shouted: "Goodbye, beautiful island! Goodbye, heroes of the island!" The speedboat gradually moved away from the island, and the signal tower on the island continuously sent signals of "Wishing the delegation a safe journey!" (Attached picture)
    The delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army deeply visits various frontier companies. This is a scene of Comrade Zhi Wanjian, a representative of the Volunteer Army, warmly comforting the model cooking class of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Yunnan border.

    一个海岛上的慰问
    晓江
      三月八日，天气虽然阴沉，海上却风平浪静，这是我们在海上慰问的最后一天，我们到了最偏僻的一个海岛上。这个岛在过去真正是名符其实的孤岛，不但因为他孤悬海外，而且因为他本身就荒无人烟，没有居民，没有房屋，有的就是孤山、旷野，蒿草、大石。可是，现在这里却完全变样了。一上这个岛，我们就被人民解放军战士们包围着欢迎到他们的俱乐部里，俱乐部是新盖的，还可以闻得到刚刚粉刷过的气味，墙壁上布满了各色各样鲜艳的画片和地图。指导员兴奋地向我们讲起了这个孤岛的发展变化史。
    “自从我们解放了这个岛，我们两只手就没有闲过，我们要保卫它、建设它，我们要把荒岛变成乐园，我们要在这里安家。困难是有的，没有工具，我们就用石头砸石头，用手当泥铲，原来的草窝棚就变成现在的石头房子了。一到风暴季节，就要断绝接济，往往十天半月吃不上一粒米，我们就跳到海里在惊涛骇浪中找寻充饥的东西。水，就是能喝的淡水，在岛上是最难得的了，怎么办？依靠大陆运来。水是多么珍贵啊！我们爱护一滴水就像爱护一滴血一样，常常一盆水被几十个人用来洗脸刷牙，甚至劳动时滴下一滴汗都觉得可惜呀！”
    代表们听着，听着，有点渴了。可是大家不住地用舌头舐着嘴唇，桌上虽然摆着清香的茶，谁也不愿再呷一口了。指导员马上发现了，笑着说道：“喝吧！缺水，这是过去的情况了，现在我们有了井啦！大家感到缺水的困难一定得想法解决，于是动手挖了几口储水井，下雨时，大家就用各种家俱到山崖下、屋檐下接水，下雪时，大家便把干净的雪扫到井里，这样，我们吃水的困难就算解决了。”这时，一个浙江籍战士端过一杯水递给代表们说：“品一品吧，比咱家乡的龙井还有滋味呢！”志愿军的代表一边喝着，一边点着头说：“要不是指导员说，我还真喝不出这是雨水和雪水哩！”
  战士们的劳动终于改变了“孤岛”的面貌。刚刚来到岛上时的“蒿草一人深，大石遍地存”的景象变化了，现在，这个岛正像战士们歌唱的：“要住住在××岛，春有樱桃秋有枣，人住楼房羊吃草，百鸟常往岛上跑！”
    的确，岛上不但有了战士们培植的好多植物，也有了战士们喂养的动物了。提起这，人们就要谈到牧羊能手矫同圣。三年来，在他精心抚育下，已从七只小羊羔繁殖到三百只大绵羊了，不仅供给本岛肉食，还支援着外岛的兄弟部队。当他们听说我们要来的时候，就特意宰了一只大肥羊！头天晚上就把饺子包好了，叫做“迎亲饺”。
    这天正是三八节，我们文工团的女同志，为了庆祝自己的节日，特别预备了针线要为守岛战士缝补衣服，同时还深入伙房一边慰问，一边帮炊事员烧饭做菜，刷锅洗碗。饭后，大家就在一起交谈起来了。炊事员老王说：“你们真跟到了自己家一样，啥事都管，为了庆祝三八节，来来来……”老王说着，就从挂包里掏出一个苹果来，按人分了八块，他一面分，一面说：“这是烟台苹果，过年时发的，听说你们来，我就没舍得吃，礼轻人意重，这是我老王的一片心，都尝尝吧！”停了一下，老王又说：“不过，以后你们再来呀，就不吃这陆上的苹果了。”他指着窗外一片树苗说：“看，那就是咱种的果木树，保管结的果子比这还要香还要甜。你们再看这边吧！咱正计划着修花园，盖动物园，筑马路呢！到那时就兴许不叫××岛，改叫××公园啦！”老王越说越起劲，代表们都听入了迷。
    这时，凡是有代表的地方，就有亲切的谈话。东屋里，志愿军功臣朱勇的身边围着一大群守岛的战士，正在问她志愿军在朝鲜学习、守卫的情况；西屋里，文工团的同志们围着岛上牧羊能手矫同圣，要他介绍他们的海岛生活。还有一些代表和海岛战士们围坐在草芽初吐的山坡上，听代表介绍祖国四年来建设的新气象。一个战士听了代表们的谈话兴奋地说：“咱们志愿军和解放军，要扭成一根绳，你们在朝鲜前线，我们在祖国边疆，共同保卫祖国社会主义建设，不准敌人侵犯它的一丝一毫！”
    接着一枚金黄色的毛主席纪念章就从志愿军功臣的胸前摘下戴到这个战士的身上了，两只结实的手紧握着，紧握着，很久很久不放！
    当海上的灯塔射出第一线光芒的时候，夜色朦胧了，代表们怀着依依不舍的心情跨上了快艇。在摆渡的海面上扬起一片热情的歌声：千江百水归大海，红花绿叶总有根，骨肉分离情意重，革命友谊重十分；我们在朝鲜日夜想，想念大哥解放军，千山万水来慰问，带来一颗火热的心；解放军，志愿军，两棵大树一条根，解放军，志愿军，同胞兄弟一母生；你们巩固国防守边疆；我们抗美援朝保和平，守边疆来保和平，保卫社会主义建设早成功。
    艇上响起清脆的哨音时，船头调向大陆，轮机发动的声音、掌声和喊声响成一片。代表们和文工团员们在喊：“再见，美丽的海岛！再见，守岛的英雄！”快艇离岛渐渐地远了，从海岛的信号塔上，不时地发出“祝代表团一路平安”的信号！（附图片）
    慰问解放军代表团深入边疆各个连队进行慰问。这是志愿军代表支万鑑同志向驻守云南边疆的人民解放军某部模范炊事班热烈慰问的情形。　（解放军画报社稿　张青云摄）
