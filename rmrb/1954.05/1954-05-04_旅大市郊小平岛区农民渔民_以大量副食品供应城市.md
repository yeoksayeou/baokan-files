    Farmers and fishermen in Xiaopingdao District, a suburb of Dalian City, are actively developing non-staple food production to supply urban residents. Fishermen, who in the past only went to sea during peak season, went to sea half a month earlier this year, allowing city residents to eat fresh fish earlier. The two small motorboats of the Zhongxing Fishery Production Cooperative caught more than 10,000 jin of eel in one trip. Luanjin Village, a model chicken-raising village, supplied the city with more than 630,000 eggs from January to the end of March, and is now preparing to breed another 25,000 chickens. The Youjia Village Advanced Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative raises 45 dairy goats and 1 dairy cow; cooperative members deliver fresh milk to workers every morning or evening. The Miaoling Village Liu Pishang Production Cooperative plants kohlrabi, cucumbers, and kidney beans in stages to ensure a constant supply of vegetables to the city.

    旅大市郊小平岛区农民渔民
    以大量副食品供应城市
    旅大市市郊小平岛区农民、渔民，积极发展副食品生产，以供应城市居民。渔民们过去往往要到旺季才下海捕鱼，今年提前半个月出了海，使城市人民早日吃到鲜鱼。中兴渔业生产合作社的两个小汽船，出海一次就捕了一万多斤长脖鱼。养鸡模范村——栾金村，从一月到三月底共供给城市六十三万多个鸡蛋，现在准备再繁殖两万五千只鸡。由家村先进畜牧业生产合作社，饲养着四十五头奶羊和一头奶牛；社员们在每天早晨或在晚上把鲜奶送给工人。庙岭村柳丕相生产合作社，分期种植大头菜、黄瓜、芸豆，以便经常向城市供应蔬菜。
